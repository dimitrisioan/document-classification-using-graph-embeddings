questions
and

what
is
ripem
ripem
is
a
program
which
performs
privacy
enhanced
mail
pem
using
the
cryptographic
techniques
of
rsa
and
des
it
allows
your
electronic
mail
to
have
the
properties
of
authentication
ie
who
sent
it
can
be
confirmed
and
privacy
ie
nobody
can
read
it
except
the
intended
recipient
ripem
was
written
primarily
by
mark
riordan
most
of
the
code
is
in
the
public
domain
except
for
the
rsa
routines
which
are
a
library
called
rsaref
licensed
from
rsa
data
security
inc
how
can
i
get
ripem
ripem
contains
the
library
of
cryptographic
routines
rsaref
which
is
considered
munitions
and
thus
is
exportrestricted
from
distribution
to
people
who
are
not
citizens
or
permanent
residents
of
the
us
or
canada
therefore
the
following
request
is
quoted
from
the
readme
file
please
do
not
export
the
cryptographic
code
in
this
distribution
outside
of
the
usa
or
canada
this
is
a
personal
request
from
me
the
author
of
ripem
and
a
condition
of
your
use
of
ripem
note
that
rsaref
is
not
in
the
public
domain
and
a
license
for
it
is
included
with
the
distribution
you
should
read
it
before
using
ripem
the
best
way
to
get
it
is
to
ask
a
friend
for
a
copy
since
this
will
reduce
the
load
on
those
sites
that
do
carry
it
not
to
mention
the
humans
that
run
them
naturally
this
requires
that
you
trust
the
friend
ripem
is
available
via
anonymous
ftp
to
citizens
and
permanent
residents
in
the
us
from
rsacom
cd
to
rsaref
and
read
the
readme
file
for
info
last
i
looked
this
site
contains
only
the
source
tree
and
does
not
contain
compiled
binaries
or
the
nice
mac
version
ripem
as
well
as
some
other
crypt
stuff
has
its
home
site
on
rpubclmsuedu
which
is
open
to
nonanonymous
ftp
for

there
cd

binaries
for
many

are
available
here
in
addition
to
the
full
source
tree
will
ripem
run
on
my
machine
probably
it
has
already
been
ported

most

next

include
a

nice
maclike
port
written

lau
author
of

more
ports
are
expected
and
help
of
users
is
invited
will
ripem
work
with
my
mailer
probably
how
easy
and
clean
the
effective
interface
is
will
depend
on
the
sophistication
and
modularity
of
the
mailer
though
the
users
guide
included
with
the
distribution
discusses
ways
to
use
ripem
with
many
popular
mailers
including
berkeley
mush
elm
and
mh
code
is
also
included
in
elisp
to
allow
easy
use
of
ripem
inside
gnu
emacs
if
you
make
a
new
interface
for
ripem
or
create
an
improvement
on
one
in
the
distribution
which
you
believe
is
convenient
to
use
secure
and
may
be
useful
to
others
feel
free
to
post
it
to
altsecurityripem
what
is
rsa
rsa
is
a
crypto
system
which
is
asymmetric
or
publickey
this
means
that
there
are
two
different
related
keys
one
to
encrypt
and
one
to
decrypt
because
one
cannot
reasonably
be
derived
from
the
other
you
may
publish
your
encryption
or
public
key
widely
and
keep
your
decryption
or
private
key
to
yourself
anyone
can
use
your
public
key
to
encrypt
a
message
but
only
you
hold
the
private
key
needed
to
decrypt
it
note
that
the
message
sent
with
rsa
is
normally
just
the
des
key
to
the
real
message
see
what
is
des
note
that
the
above
only
provides
for
privacy
for
authentication
the
fingerprint
of
the
message
see
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
encrypted
with
the
senders
private
key
the
recipient
can
use
the
senders
public
key
to
decrypt
it
and
confirm
that
the
message
must
have
come
from
the
sender
rsa
was
named
for
the
three
men
rivest
shamir
and
adleman
who
invented
it
to
find
out
more
about
rsa
ftp
to
rsacom
and
look
in
pubfaq
or
look
in
scicrypt
what
is
des
des
is
the
data
encryption
standard
a
widely
used
symmetric
or
secretkey
crypto
system
unlike
rsa
des
uses
the
same
key
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
messages
however
des
is
much
faster
than
rsa
ripem
uses
both
des
and
rsa
it
generates
a
random
key
and
encrypts
your
mail
with
des
using
that
key
it
then
encrypts
that
key
with
the
recipients
public
rsa
key
and
includes
the
result
in
the
letter
allowing
the
recipient
to
recover
the
des
key
des
is
sometimes
considered
weak
because
it
is
somewhat
old
and
uses
a
key
length
considered
too
short
by
modern
standards
however
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
against
an
opponent
smaller
than
a
large
corporation
or
government
agency
it
is
not
unlikely
that
future
ripems
will
strengthen
the
symmetric
cipher
possibly
by
using
multiple
encryption
with
des
what
is
pem
and
how
does
ripem
relate
pem
is
privacy
enhanced
mail
a
system
for
allowing
easy
transfer
of
encrypted
electronic
mail
it
is
described
in
rfcs
these
documents
have
been
approved
and
obsolete
the
old
rfcs
ripem
is
not
really
a
complete
implementation
of
pem
because
pem
specifies
certificates
for
authenticating
keys
which
ripem
does
not
handle
at
this
time
their
addition
is
planned
whats
this
about
distributing
and
authenticating
keys
for
a
remote
user
to
be
able
to
send
secure
mail
to
you
she
must
know
your
public
key
for
you
to
be
able
to
confirm
that
the
message
received
came
from
her
you
must
know
her
public
key
it
is
important
that
this
information
be
accurate
if
a
bad
guy
convinces
her
that
his
key
is
in
fact
yours
she
will
send
messages
which
he
can
read
ripem
allows
for
three
methods
of
key
management
a
central
server
the
distributed
finger
servers
and
a
flat
file
all
three
are
described
in
the
ripem
users
guide
which
is
part
of
the
distribution
none
of
them
provide
perfect
security
why
do
all
ripem
public
keys
look
very
similar
ripem
public
keys
begin
with
a
pkcs
identifier
describing
various
characteristics
about
the
key
so
the
first
bunch
of
characters
in
your
key
may
be
the
same
as
those
of
lots
of
other
peoples
keys
this
does
not
mean
your
keys
are
similar
but
only
that
they
are
the
same
class
of
key
were
generated
with
the
same
program
are
of
the
same
length
etc
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
a
message
digest
algorithm
produced
by
rsa
data
security
inc
it
provides
a
fingerprint
or
cryptographically
secure
hash
of
the
plaintext
it
is
cryptographically
secure
because
it
is
not
possible
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
computation
to
produce
a
different
plaintext
which
produces
the
same
fingerprint
thus
instead
of
signing
the
entire
message
with
the
senders
private
key
only
the
of
the
message
needs
to
be
signed
for
authentication
is
sometimes
used
for
other
purposes
for
example
it
is
often
used
to
map
an
input
of
arbitrary
length
to
bits
of
data
as
a
passphrase
interpreter
or
cookie
generator
is
described
in
its
entirety
including
an
implementation
in
c
in
rfc
what
is
pgp
pgp
is
another
cryptographic
mail
program
called
pretty
good
privacy
pgp
has
been
around
longer
than
ripem
and
works
somewhat
differently
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
in
any
way
though
pgp
does
also
use
rsa
some
major
differences
between
pgp
and
ripem
pgp
has
more
key
management
features
particularly
for
users
without
a
direct
network
connection
ripem
conforms
to
the
pem
rfcs
and
thus
has
a
greater
probability
of
working
with
other
pem
software
pgp
makes
no
attempt
to
be
compatible
with
anything
other
than
pgp
in
fact
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
pgp
ripem
uses
rsaref
a
library
of
rsa
routines
from
rsa
data
security
inc
rsaref
comes
with
a
license
which
allows
noncommercial
use
pgp
uses
its
own
implementation
of
rsa
which
is
not
licensed
thus
pkp
the
firm
holding
the
us
patents
on
the
rsa
algorithm
claims
that
it
is
a
infringement
of
that
patent
to
make
use
or
sell
pgp
in
the
us
or
canada
in
acknowledgement
of
this
pgps
original
author
phil
zimmermann
says
in
the
documentation
in
fact
if
you
live
in
the
usa
and
you
are
not
a
federal
agency
you
shouldnt
actually
run
pgp
on
your
computer
because
public
key
partners
wants
to
forbid
you
from
running
my
software
pgp
is
contraband
both
pgp
and
ripem
are
exportrestricted
and
cannot
be
sent
outside
the
us
and
canada
however
pgp
already
exists
on
many
ftp
sites
in
europe
and
other
places
whether
you
use
pgp
or
ripem
or
whatever
the
documentation
to
pgp
is
recommended
reading
to
anyone
interested
in
such
issues
note
that
the
above
facts
both
regarding
patent
and
export
restrictions
are
somewhat
controversial
many
people
think
it
shouldnt
be
that
way
and
some
people
interpret
various
documents
differently
unfortunately
discussions
of
it
on
the
net
inevitably
seem
to
produce
more
heat
than
light
and
probably
belong
in

what
about
rpem
rpem
stands
for
rabin
privacy
enhanced
mail
it
was
similar
to
ripem
but
used
a
publickey
cipher
invented
by
rabin
which
is
not
rsa
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
patent
on
rsa
it
was
written
by
mark
riordan
the
same
author
as
ripem
its
distribution
was
halted
when
contrary
to
the
beliefs
of
many
including
rabin
public
key
partners
pkp
claimed
that
their
patent
was
broad
enough
to
cover
any
publickey
cipher
whose
strength
rested
in
the
difficulty
of
factoring
products
of
large
primes
not
just
rsa
this
claim
is
not
universally
accepted
by
any
means
but
was
not
challenged
for
pragmatic
reasons
rpem
is
not
really
used
anymore
it
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
or
pgp
what
is
mime
mime
stands
for
multipurpose

about

in

compmailmime
how
pem
should
interact
with

use
the

solution
of

applicationxripem

standards
will
emerge

what
is
rsa
rsa
is
a
crypto
system
which
is
asymmetric
or
publickey
this
means
that
there
are
two
different
related
keys
one
to
encrypt
and
one
to
decrypt
because
one
cannot
reasonably
be
derived
from
the
other
you
may
publish
your
encryption
or
public
key
widely
and
keep
your
decryption
or
private
key
to
yourself
anyone
can
use
your
public
key
to
encrypt
a
message
but
only
you
hold
the
private
key
needed
to
decrypt
it
note
that
the
message
sent
with
rsa
is
normally
just
the

key

some

what
is
des
des
is
the
data
encryption
standard
a
widely
used
symmetric
or
secretkey
crypto
system
unlike
rsa
des
uses
the
same
key
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
messages
however
des
is
much
faster
than
rsa
ripem
uses
both
des
and
rsa
it
generates
a
random
key
and
encrypts
your
mail
with
des
using
that
key
it
then
encrypts
that
key
with
the
recipients
public
rsa
key
and
includes
the
result
in
the
letter
allowing
the
recipient
to
recover
the
des
key
des
is
sometimes
considered
weak
because
it
is
somewhat
old
and
uses
a
key
length
considered
too
short
by
modern
standards
however
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
against
an
opponent
smaller
than
a
large
corporation
or
government
agency
it
is
not
likely
that
the
pem
standard
will
incorporate
support
for
other
symmetric
ciphers
in
the
near
future
because
there
is
a
strong
feeling
that
pem
should
be
stable
so
it
can
become
utilized
widely
without
early
problems
with
interoperability
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
a
message
digest
algorithm
produced
by
rsa
data
security
inc
it
provides
a
fingerprint
or
cryptographically
secure
hash
of
the
plaintext
it
is
cryptographically
secure
because
it
is
not
possible
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
computation
to
produce
a
different
plaintext
which
produces
the
same
fingerprint
thus
instead
of
signing
the
entire
message
with
the
senders
private
key
only
the
of
the
message
needs
to
be
signed
for
authentication
can
also
be
exchanged
directly
for
authentication
for
example
ripem
public
keys
include
an
of
the
public
key
in
the
file
so
parties
wishing
to
confirm
their
keys
are
authentic
via
a
separate
channel
merely
need
exchange
of
keys
and
verify
their
accuracy
is
sometimes
used
for
other
purposes
for
example
it
is
often
used
to
map
an
input
of
arbitrary

there
have
been
some
recent
suggestions
that

not
be
as
strong
a
hash
as
was
originally
believed
presumably
some
other

function
will
be
used

this

these

ripem

not
really

this
about

you

ripem

a

all
three
are
described
in

which

part
of

none

the

the

isnt
it
a

to

this

rfc
the

this

the

pkp

ripem
was
originally
created
with
no
connection
to
rsadsi
other
than
its
use
of
the
rsaref

and
for
no
reason
other
than
its
authors
desire
to
see
widespread
use
of
publickey
cryptography
however
after
the
ball
started
rolling
people
at
rsadsi
got
interested
rsadsi
decided
to
carry
ripem
on
its
ftp
site
and
some
people
there
started
making
their
own
ripem

and
contributing

ripem
even
won

built
on

why
do
all

look
very
similar
ripem
public

the

be
the

as
those
of

of
other

this
does
not
mean
your

are
similar
but
only
that
they
are
the

with

pgp
is
another

pgp

somewhat
differently
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
in
any
way
though
pgp
does
also
use

a
few
major
differences
between
pgp
and
ripem
pgp
has
more
key
management
features
particularly
for
users
without
a
direct
network
connection
ripem
conforms
to
the
pem
rfcs
and
thus
has
a
greater
probability
of
working
with
other
pem
software
pgp
makes
no
attempt
to
be
compatible
with
anything
other
than

ripem
uses
rsaref
a
library
of

from
rsadsi
which

a

pgp

pkp
claims
that
it
is
a
violation
of

phil

the

he

that
a

but
it
hasnt
happened
and
there
seems
little
prospect
of
it
happening
in

in
fact
if
you
live
in

and
you
are
not

you
shouldnt
actually
run
pgp
on
your

because
public

to
forbid
you
from

pgp

unfortunately
its

about
rpem
rpem
stands
for
rabin
privacy
enhanced

it
was
similar
to
ripem
but
used
a
publickey
cipher
invented
by
rabin
which
is
not
rsa
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
patents
on
publickey
systems
it
was
written
by
mark
riordan
who
later
wrote
ripem
its
distribution
was
halted
when
contrary
to
the
beliefs
of
many
including
rabin
pkp
claimed
that
their
patents
were
broad
enough
to
cover
the
cipher
employed
this
claim
is
not
universally
accepted
but
was
not
challenged
for
pragmatic
reasons
rpem
is
not
really
used
anymore
it
is
not

ripem

pgp
what

mime

some
possible
attacks
on

this
is
a
living
list
of
potential
weaknesses
to
keep
your
eyes
open
for
when
using
ripem
for
secure
electronic
mail
it
does
not
go
into
great
detail
and
is
almost
certainly
not
exhaustive
obviously
many
of
the
weaknesses
are
weaknesses
of
cryptographically
secured
mail
in
general
and
will
pertain
to
secure

other
than

cryptanalysis
attacks
breaking
rsa
would
allow
an
attacker
to
find
out
your
private
key
in
which
case
he
could
read
any
mail
encrypted
to
you
and
sign
messages
with
your
private
key
rsa
is
generally
believed
to
be
resistant
to
all
standard
cryptanalytic
techniques
even
a
standard
key
about
bits
with
ripem
is
long
enough
to
render
this
impractical
barring
a
huge
investment
in
hardware
or
a
breakthrough
in
factoring
breaking
des
would
allow
an
attacker
to
read
any
given
message
since
the
message
itself
is
encrypted
with
des
it
would
not
allow
an
attacker
to
claim
to
be
you
des
has
only
bits
in
its
key
and
thus
could
conceivably
be
compromised
by
brute
force
with
sufficient
hardware
but
few
agencies
have
such
money
to
devote
to
simply
read
one
message
since
each
message
has
a
different
des
key
the
work
for
each
message
would
remain
high
key
management
attacks
stealing
your
private
key
would
allow
the
same
benefits
as
breaking
rsa
to
safeguard
it
it
is
encrypted
with
a
des
key
which
is
derived
from
a
passphrase
you
type
in
however
if
an
attacker
can
get
a
copy
of
your
private
keyfile
and
your
passphrase
by
snooping
network
packets
tapping
lines
or
whatever
he
could
break
the
whole
scheme
the
main
risk
is
that
of
transferring
either
the
passphrase
or
the
private
key
file
across
an
untrusted
link
so
dont
do
that
run
ripem
on
a
trusted
machine
preferably
one
sitting
right
in
front
of
you
ideally
your
own
machine
in
your
own
home
or
maybe
office
which
nobody
else
has
physical
access
to
fooling
you
into
accepting
a
bogus
public
key
for
someone
else
could
allow
an
opponent
to
deceive
you
into
sending
secret
messages
to
him
rather
than
to
the
real
recipient
if
the
enemy
can
fool
your
intended
recipient
as
well
he
could
reencrypt
the
messages
with
the
other
bogus
public
key
and
pass
them
along
it
is
important
to
get
the
proper
public
keys
of
other
people
the
most
common
mechanism
for
this
is
finger
assuming
the
opponent
has
not
compromised
routers
or
daemons
or
such
finger
can
be
given
a
fair
amount
of
trust
the
strongest
method
of
key
authentication
is
to
exchange
keys
in
person
however
this
is
not
always
practical
having
other
people
vouch
for
you
by
signing
a
statement
containing
your
key
is
possible
although
ripem
doesnt
have
features
for
doing
this
as
automatically
as
pgp
ripem
does
generate
and
check
fingerprints
of
public
keys
in
the
key
files
they
may
be
exchanged
via
a
separate
channel
for
authentication
playback
attacks
even
if
an
opponent
cannot
break
the
cryptography
an
opponent
could
still
cause
difficulties
for
example
suppose
you
send
a
message
with
miconly
a
pem
mode
which
does
not
provide
disclosure
protection
to
alice
which
says
ok
lets
do
that
your
opponent
intercepts
it
and
now
resends
it
to
bob
who
now
has
a
message
which
is
authenticated
as
from
you
telling
him
to
do
that
of
course
he
may
interpret
it
in
an
entirely
different
context
or
your
opponent
could
transmit
the
same
message
to
the
same
recipient
much
later
figuring
it
would
be
seen
differently
at
a
later
time
or
the
opponent
could
change
the
originatorname
to
himself
register
your
public
key
as
his
and
send
a
message
hoping
the
recipient
will
send
him
return
mail
indicating
perhaps
even
quoting
the
unknown
message
to
defeat
playback
attacks
the
plaintext
of
each
message
should
include
some
indication
of
the
sender
and
recipient
and
a
unique
identifier
typically
the
date
a
good
frontend
script
for
ripem
should
do
this
automatically
imho
as
a
recipient
you
should
be
sure
that
the
originatorname
header
and
the
sender
indicated
within
the
plaintext
are
the
same
that
you
really
are
a
recipient
and
that
the
message
is
not
an
old
one
some
this
also
can
and
should
be
automated
the
author
of
this
faq
has
made
a
modest
attempt
at
automating
the
process
of
generating
and
checking
encapsulated
headers
the
programs
are
included
in
the
standard
distribution
in
the
utils
directory
local
attacks
clearly
the
security
of
ripem
cannot
be
greater
than
the
security
of
the
machine
where
the
encryption
is
performed
for
example
under
unix
a
superuser
could
manage
to
get
at
your
encrypted
mail
although
it
would
take
some
planning
and
effort
to
do
something
like
replace
the
ripem
executable
with
a
trojan
horse
or
to
get
a
copy
of
the
plaintext
depending
how
its
stored
in
addition
the
link
between
you
and
the
machine
running
ripem
is
an
extension
of
that
if
you
decrypt
with
ripem
on
a
remote
machine
which
you
are
connected
to
via
network
or
worse
yet
modem
an
eavesdropper
could
see
the
plaintext
and
probably
also
your
passphrase
ripem
should
only
be
executed
on
systems
you
trust
obviously
in
the
extreme
case
ripem
should
only
be
used
on
your
own
machine
which
you
have
total
control
over
and
which
nobody
else
has
access
to
which
has
only
carefully
examined
software
known
to
be
free
of
viruses
and
so
on
however
theres
a
very
real
tradeoff
between
convenience
and
security
here
a
more
moderately
cautious
user
might
use
ripem
on
a
unix
workstation
where
other
people
have
access
even
root
access
but
increase
security
by
keeping
private
keys
and
the
statically
linked
of
course
executable
on
a
floppy
disk
some
people
will
keep
ripem
on
a
multiuser
system
but
when
dialing
in
over
an
insecure
line
they
will
download
the
message
to
their
own
system
and
perform
the
ripem
decryption
there
however
the
security
provided
by
such
a
mechanism
is
somewhat
illusory
since
you
presumably
type
your
cleartext
password
to
log
in
youve
just
given
away
the
store
since
the
attacker
can
now
log
in
as
you
and
install
traps
in
your
account
to
steal
your
private
key
next
time
you
use
it
from
a
less
insecure
line
this
will
likely
remain
the
situation
as
long
as
most
systems
use
the
rather
quaint
mechanism
of
cleartext
password
authentication
i
find
it
nice
to
put
a
brief
statement
of
how
carefully
i
manage
my
security
arrangement
in
my
plan
next
to
my
public
key
so
that
potential
correspondents
can
be
aware
what
level
of
precautions
are
in
place
some
people
use
two
keys
a
short
one
which
is
not
carefully
managed
for
ordinary
use
and
a
longer
one
which
is
treated
with
greater
care
for
critical
correspondence
untrusted
partner
attacks
ripems
encryption
will
ensure
that
only
a
person
with
the
private
key
corresponding
to
the
public
key
used
to
encrypt
the
data
may
read
the
traffic
however
once
someone
with
that
key
gets
the
message
she
may
always
make
whatever
kind
of
transformations
she
wishes
there
exist
no
cryptographic
barriers
to
a
recipient
say
taking
an
encrypted
message
and
converting
it
to
a
miconly
message
signed
by
you
and
readable
by
anyone
although
ripem
does
not
provide
this
functionality
indeed
the
latest
pem
draft
i
have
seen
specifically
states
that
such
transformations
should
be
possible
to
allow
forwarding
functions
to
work
including
the
recipients
in
the
plaintext
as
mentioned
above
will
make
it
possible
for
recipients
of
a
redistributed
message
to
be
aware
of
its
original
nature
naturally

about
what

when

clearing
of
magnetic
media
certain
types
of
removable
media
eg
magnetic
tape
floppy
disk
cassettes
and
magnetic
cards
may
be
cleared
by
overwriting
the
entire
media
one
time
with
any
one
character
floppy
disks
may
be
cleared
by
applying
a
vendors
formatting
program
that
overwrites
each
location
with
a
given
character
fixed
media
eg
winchester
disks
should
be
cleared
by
overwriting
at
least
one
time
with
any
one
character
one
way
to
do
this
is
by
applying
a
vendorsupplied
formatting
program
that
overwrites
each
location
on
the
disk
with
a
given
character
if
it
can
be
shown
that
this
program
actually
works
as
advertised
the
user
should
beware
some
programs
that
purport
to
overwrite
all
locations
do
not
actually
do
this
cleared
media
may
be
resides
within
the
controlled
facility
or
released
for
destruction
however
they
should
be
marked
and
controlled
at
the
level
of
the
most
restrictive
sensitivity
of
information
ever
recorded
declassification
of
magnetic
media
certain
types
of
removable
media
can
be
declassified
using
a
degaussing
device
that
has
been
approved
for
declassifying
media
of
that
type
a
list
of
approved
devices
is
maintained
by
the
nsa
if
a
fixed
medium
for
example
a
hard
or
winchester
disk
is
operative
an
approved
method
of
declassifying
the
disk
pack
is
to
employ
an
overwrite
procedure
which
must
overwrite
all
addressable
locations
at
least
three
times
by
writing
any
character
then
its
complement
eg
binary
ones
and
binary
zeros
alternatively
when
fixed
media
become
inoperative
it
is
impossible
to
declassify
the
media
by
the
overwrite
method
in
this
case
there
are
two
alternate
procedures
that
may
be
used
disassemble
the
disk
pack
and
degauss
each
platter
with
the
appropriate
approved
degaussing
equipment
and
courier
the
inoperative
media
to
the
vendors
facility
have
the
magnetic
media
eg
disk
platter
removed
in
sight
of
the
courier
and
returned
to
the
courier
for
destruction
at
the
secure
site
the
vendor
can
then
install
new
platters
and
repair
any
other
problems

lots

i
hate
to
follow
up
to
my
own
posting
but
i
should
perhaps
clarify
some
things
so
i
wont
get
flamed
first
of
all
when
im
talking
about
factoring
the
modulus
or
a
breakthrough
in
factoring
what
i
really
mean
is
a
breakthrough
in
the
cryptanalysis
of
rsa
i
know
that
factoring
and
breaking
rsa
are
not
proven
to
be
equivalent
its
just
so
damn
convenient
not
to
repeat
this
every
time
i
also
have
to
admit
that
i
dont
really
know
if
the
nongroup
property
of
a
cipher
is
essential
only
for
key
chaining
i
have
thought
about
it
a
little
while
but
i
cant
find
a
way
that
a
cryptanalyst
could
exploit
a
group
structure
that
of
course
means
nothing
at
all
then
i
wrote
please
note
that
as
long
as
it
is
much
harder
to
factor
a
rsa
modulus
than
it
is
to
generate
it
the
increase
in
computer
speed
alone
will
keep
key
lengths
and
modulus
factoring
in
lockstep
ie
people
will
simply
start
using
longer
moduli
and
still
be
safe
what
i
meant
was
that
as
long
as
the
only
advantage
of
the
cryptanalyst
is
a
faster
computer
then
we
will
probably
have
rsa
for
a
long
time
to
come
because
even
if
moduli
somehow
could
be
broken
with
fast
computers
not
with
a
new
algorithm
then
people
would
simply
use
longer
moduli
both
users
and
cryptanalysts
benefit
from
better
technology
in
the
same
way

this
keeps
the

away

this
thread
brings
up
the
more
general
question
can
any
crypto
implementation
for
which
highly
publicly
scrutinized
source
code
is
not
available
ever
be
trusted
after
ibm
had
invented
the
des
and
the
nbs
had
advertised
for
proposals
but
before
ibm
had
decided
to
respond
i
argued
strenuously
that
they
should
not
they
should
keep
it
proprietary
the
biggest
proponent
of
proposing
was
dr
lewis
branscomb
dr
branscomb
was
the
ibm
chief
scientist
and
had
come
to
ibm
from
nbs
fortunately
for
all
of
us
dr
branscomb
understood
the
answer
to
the
above
question
much
better
than
i
he
realized
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
gain
acceptance
for
any
cryptographic
mechanism
because
of
the
necessary
complexity
publicity
would
not
be
sufficient
and
neither
would
authority
in
fact
it
has
taken
both
of
those
plus
more
than
years
we
have
also
had
independence
the
des
was
solicited
by
nbs
invented
and
proposed
by
ibm
and
vetted
by
nbs
it
has
also
been
examined
and
vetted
by
experts
like
adi
shamir
who
are
not
subject
to
influence
by
any
of
these
even
now
there
are
still
people
posting
on
this
list
who
do
not
trust
the
des
in
spite
of
all
the
time
all
of
the
analysis
and
all
of
the
public
scrutiny
of
course
it
is
just
this
point
that
nist
misses
when
it
attempts
to
gain
acceptance
for
a
novel
mechanism
developed
in
secret
on
the
basis
of
authority
alone
we
had
a
long
thread
here
about
whether
or
not
the
nsa
can
break
the
des
that
is
a
silly
question
at
some
cost
and
in
some
time
they
can
break
anything
the
important
question
is
at
what
cost
and
in
what
time
the
fundamental
strength
of
the
des
and
rsa
are
not
nearly
so
important
as
what
we
know
about
their
strength
as
long
as
we
understand
the
cost
and
duration
for
an
attacker
then
we
can
use
them
in
a
safe
way
at
this
point
we
may
never
replace
either
because
of
the
inability
of
any
successor
to
overcome
this
knowledge
gap
des
and
rsa
are
among
the
most
significant
inventions
of
the
century
and
the
most
important
inventions
in
the
history
of

are

is
apparently
quite

pardon
me

isnt
this
very

i
was
under
the
impression
that
a
warrent
is
needed
to
get
this
information
out
of
the
phone
company
in

protect
peoples
privacy
legal

not
ive
seen
it
done
phone
records
were
obtained
in

establish

cause
rather
than
as
a

of
it

words
for
a

a

worcester
ma
police
officer
i
spoke
with
only
a
couple
of
nights
ago
told
me
that
they
usually
only
subpeona
the
phone
companies
records
in
extreme
conditions
because
its
so
much
of
a
hassle
and
does
the
phone
company
require
written
subpoenaable
evidence
of
probable
cause
in
order
to
process
the
request
i
suggest
that
the
officer
was
disinterested
in
pursuing
your
case
even
if
you
could
prove
the
offender
had
called
you
at
a
certain
time
your
chances
of
winning
a
harassment
suit
on
the
strength
of
this
evidence
are
nil
my
contact
with
several
people
who
have
dealt
with
cases
of
extreme
phone
harassment
several
thousand
calls
in
one
case
teaches
me
that
police
in
this
area
are
quite
lethargic

ie
someone

runs
it

i

then
asked
an

what

use
instead
the

suggestion
was
to
treat
the

as
both
key
and
data
for
the
lucifer
encryption
algorithm
which
is
similar
or
identical
to

this

this

my

since
anyone
could
do
this
any

that
forces

to

is
worthless
the
law
is
much
worse
than

it

in

dont

does
never

the
difference
between

there
are
plenty
of
scenarios
where
the
user
would
have
no
idea
what
something
is
either
it
could
be
uninitialized
junk
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
user
to
show
that
its
something
a
normal
upstanding
citizen
should
have
no
one
should
ever
be
put
in

situation
especially
in

whats
disgusting
about

how
easily
most

chip
against
some
hypothetical
alleged

molester

whatever
bad

is
in
style
at
the

basically
most
people
dont
have
a
clear
distinction
between
criminals
and
suspects
as
an
analogy
its
like
they
find

loose

ask

people
may
start
to
get
the
idea
as
a

of
fact
i
do
keep
random

on

the
reason
is
without

it
takes
a

to

good

i
have
programs
that
crank
out
a
couple
bits
per
minute
which
is
pretty
conservative
but
over
time
thats
more
than
i
need
if
you
think
about
it
theres
no
point
in
actually
encrypting
random
data
because
it
just
gives
you
different
random
data
if
you
want
some
data
to
look
like
an
encrypted
file
you
just
put
an
appropriate
header
on
it
if
enough
people
do
this
some
of
them
will
be
put
in
jail
when
you
get
arrested
and
the
police
ask
for
your

you
can
tell
them
its
just
random
junk
although
of
course
they
wont
believe
you
while
youre
sitting

you
can
take
consolation
in
the

that
the

this
suggests
a
new
pc
security
product
design
approach
first
fill
the
hard
drive
with
random
files
and
files
encrypted
under
a
number
of
known
keys
then
whenever
a
new
secret
file
is
created
you
delete
a
random
file
and
replace
it
with
real
encrypted
data
new
nonsecret
files
are
encrypted
under
a
known
key
better
yet
instead
of
thrashing
around
on
the
dos
file
system
take
it
a
step
further
write
yourself
a
minimal
file
system
program
that
is
used
to
createdelete
files
endecrypt
them
to
ramdisk
list
a
directory
put
the
util
password
protected
on
a
floppy
the
catch
is
that
the
storage
space
used
by
this
util
is
not
part
of
the
dos
file
system
instead
defrag
your
disk
thus
packing
all
allocated
clusters
into
clusters
then
use
the
back
end
of
the
partition
to
hold
your
stealth
file
system
or
leave
a
small
partition
on
the
disk
that
is
not
assigned
to
dos
another
approach
might
be
to
use
a
directory
that
contains
a
set
of
invariant
files
dos
system
files
for
instance
due
to
dos
allocating
a
minimum
storage
unit
of
a
cluster
there
is
unused
physical
space
on
the
disk
between
the
tail
end
of
each
file
and
the
end
of
its
associated
cluster
these
dead
spaces
could
be
concatenated
and
used
to
hold
your
stealth
file
system
now
you
have
a
situation
where
no

appears
on

suggests
that

the
test
for

whether

in

it

moreover
the

can

immunize
the

of

you
to

at
the

of

they

identity
what
is
identity
on
the
internet
generally
today
peoples
identity
on
the
internet
is
primarily
determined
by
their
email
address
in
the
sense
that
this
is
their
most
unchanging
face
in
the
electronic
realm
this
is
your
login
name
qualified
by
the
complete
address
domain
information
for
example
people
see
this
address
when
receiving
mail
or
reading
usenet
posts
from
you
and
in
other
situations
where
programs
record
usage
some
obsolete
forms
of
addresses
such
as
bitnet
still
persist
in
email
messages
additional
information
on
the
path
that
a
message
takes
is
prepended
to
the
message
received
by
the
recipient
this
information
identifies
the
chain
of
hosts
involved
in
the
transmission
and
is
a
very
accurate
trace
of
its
origination
this
type
of
identifyandforward
protocol
is
also
used
in
the
usenet
protocol
to
a
lesser
extent
forging
these
fields
requires
corrupted
mailing
software
at
sites
involved
in
the
forwarding
and
is
very
uncommon
not
so
uncommon
is
forging
the
chain
at
the
origination
point
so
that
all
initial
sites
in
the
list
are
faked
at
the
time
the
message
is
created
tracing
these
messages
can
be
difficult
or
impossible
when
the
initial
faked
fields
are
names
of
real
machines
and
represent
real
transfer
routes
why
is
identity
unimportant
on
the
internet
the
concept
of
identity
is
closely
intertwined
with
communication
privacy
and
security
which
in
turn
are
all
critical
aspects
of
computer
networks
for
example
the
convenience
of
communication
afforded
by
email
would
be
impossible
without
conventions
for
identification
but
there
are
many
potential
abuses
of
identity
possible
that
can
have
very
severe
consequences
with
massive
computer
networks
at
the
forefront
of
the
issue
which
can
potentially
either
exacerbate
or
solve
these
problems
verifying
that
an
identity
is
correct
is
called
authentication
and
one
classic
example
of
the
problems
associated
with
it
is
hgwells
war
of
the
worlds
radio
broadcast
that
fooled
segments
of
the
population
into
thinking
that
an
alien
invasion
was
in
progress
hoaxes
of
this
order
are
not
uncommon
on
usenet
and
forged
identities
makes
them
more
insidious
people
and
their
reputations
can
be
assaulted
by
forgery
however
the
fluidity
of
identity
on
the
internet
is
for
some
one
of
its
most
attractive
features
identity
is
just
as
useful
as
it
is
harmful
a
professor
might
carefully
explain
a
topic
until
he
finds
he
is
talking
to
an
undergraduate
a
person
of
a
particular
occupation
may
be
able
to
converse
with
others
who
might
normally
shun
him
some
prejudices
are
erased
but
on
the
other
hand
many
prejudices
are
useful
a
scientist
might
argue
he
can
better
evaluate
the
findings
of
a
paper
as
a
reviewer
if
he
knows
more
about
the
authors
likewise
he
may
be
more
likely
to
reject
it
based
on
unfair
or
irrelevant
criteria
on
the
other
side
of
the
connection
the
author
may
find
identities
of
reviewers
useful
in
exerting
pressure
for
acceptance
identity
is
especially
crucial
in
establishing
and
regulating
credit
not
necessarily
financial
and
ownership
and
usage
many
functions
in
society
demand
reliable
and
accurate
techniques
for
identification
heavy
reliance
will
be
placed
on
digital
authentication
as
global
economies
become
increasingly
electronic
many
government
functions
and
services
are
based
on
identification
and
law
enforcement
frequently
hinges
on
it
hence
employees
of
many
government
organizations
push
toward
stronger
identification
structures
but
when
does
identification
invade
privacy
the
growth
of
the
internet
is
provoking
social
forces
of
massive
proportions
decisions
made
now
on
issues
of
identity
will
affect
many
future
users
especially
as
the
network
becomes
increasingly
global
universal
widespread
and
entrenched
and
the
positive
or
adverse
affects
of
these
actions
intended
and
inadvertent
will
literally
be
magnified
exponentially
how
does
my
email
address
not
identify
me
and
my
background
your
email
address
may
contain
information
that
influences
peoples
perceptions
of
your
background
the
address
may
identify
you
as
from
a
department
at
a
particular
university
an
employee
at
a
company
or
a
government
worker
it
may
contain
your
last
name
initials
or
cryptic
identification
codes
independent
of
both
in
the
us
some
are
based
on
parts
of
social
security
numbers
others
are
in
the
form
where
the
number
is
incremented
in
the
order
that
new
users
are
added
to
the
system
standard
internet
addresses
also
can
contain
information
on
your
broad
geographical
location
or
nationhood
however
none
of
this
information
is
guaranteed
to
be
correct
or
be
there
at
all
the
fields
in
the
domain
qualification
of
the
username
are
based
on
rather
arbitrary
organization
such
as
mostly
invisible
network
cabling
distributions
the
only
point
to
make
is
that
early
fields
in
the
address
are
more
specific
such
as
specific
computer
names
or
local
networks
and
the
later
ones
the
most
general
such
as
continental
domains
typically
the
first
field
is
the
name
of
the
computer
receiving
mail
gleaning
information
from
the
email
address
alone
is
sometimes
an
inspired
art
or
an
inconsistent
and
futile
exercise
for
more
information
see
the
faqs
on
email
addresses
and
known
geographical
distributions
below
however
unix
utilities
exist

how
can
i
find
out
more
about
somebody
with
a
given
email
address
one
simple
way
is
to
send
email
to
that
address
asking
another
way
is
to
send
mail
to
the
postmaster
at
that
address
ie
postmasteraddress
although
the
postmasters
job
is
more
to
help
find
user
ids
of
particular
people
given
their
real
name
and
solve
mail
routing
problems
the
sysadmin
ie
rootaddress
may
also
be
able
to
supply
information
users
with
related
email
address
may
have
information
however
all
of
these
methods
rely
on
the
time
and
patience
of
others
so
use
them
minimally
one
of
the
most
basic
tools
for
determining
identity
over
the
internet
is
the
unix
utility
finger
the
basic
syntax
is
finger
userherethereeverywhere
this
utility
uses
communication
protocols
to
query
the
computer
named
in
the
address
for
information
on
the
user
named
the
response
is
generated
completely
by
the
receiving
computer
and
may
be
in
any
format
possible
responses
are
as
follows
a
message
unknown
host
meaning
some
aspect
of
the
address
is
incorrect
two
lines
with
no
information
and
a
message
in
real
life
in
which
case
the
receiving
computer
could
not
find
any
kind
of
a
match
on
the
username
the
finger
utility
may
return
this
response
in
other
situations
a
listing
of
information
associated
with
multiple
users
some
computers
will
search
only
for
matching
user
ids
others
will
attempt
to
find
the
username
you
specified
as
a
substring
of
all
actual
full
names
of
users
kept
in
a
local
database
at
some
sites
finger
can
be
used
to
get
a
list
of
all
users
on
the
system
with
a
finger
address
in
general
this
is
often
considered
weak
security
however
because
attackers
know
valid
user
ids
to
crack
passwords
more
information
on
the
fields
returned
by
finger
is
given
below
more
information
on
finger
and
locating
peoples
email
addresses
is
given
in
the
email
faq
such
as
the
whois
lookup
utility
just
as
you
can
use
these
means
to
find
out
about
others
they
can
use
them
to
find
out
about
you
you
can
finger
yourself
to
find
out
what
is
publicly
reported
by
your
unix
system
about
you
be
careful
when
modifying
finger
data
virtually
anyone
with
internet
access
worldwide
can
query
this
information
in
one
amazing
case
the
new
york
times
writer
j
markoff
uncovered
the
identity
of
r
morris
author
of
the
internet
worm
through
the
use

and
finger
see
the
book
cyberspace
by

and
j
markoff
why
is
identification
unstable
on
the
internet
generally
identity
is
an
amorphous
and
almost
nonexistent
concept
on
the
internet
for
a
variety
of
reasons
one
is
the
inherent
fluidity
of
cyberspace
where
people
emerge
and
submerge
frequently
and
absences
are
not
readily
noted
in
the
community
most
people
remember
faces
and
voices
the
primary
means
of
casual
identification
in
the
real
world
the
arbitary
and
cryptic
sequences
of
letters
and
digits
comprising
most
email
addresses
are
not

and
far
from
a
unique
identification
of
an
individual
who
may
use
multiple
accounts
on
multiple
machines
anywhere
in
the
world
currently
internet
users
do
not
really
have
any
great
assurances
that
the
messages
in
email
and
usenet
are
from
who
they
appear
to
be
a

mailing
address
is
far
from
an
identification
of
an
individual
anyone
with
access
to
the
account
eg
they
know
the
password
either
legitimately
or
otherwise
can
send
mail
with
that
address
in
the
from
line
email
addresses
for
an
individual
tend
to
change
frequently
as
they
switch
jobs
or
make
moves
inside
their
organizations
as
part
of
current
mailing
protocol
standards
forging
the
from
line
in
mail
messages
is
a
fairly
trivial
operation
for
many
hackers
the
status
and
path
information
prepended
to
messages
by
intermediate
hosts
is
generally
unforgeable
in
general
while
possible
forgeries
are
fairly
rare
on
most
newsgroups
and
in
email
besides
these
pathological
cases
abve
there
are
many
basic
problems
with
todays
internet
protocols
affecting
identification
on
the
internet
internet
mail
standards
described
in
are
still
evolving
rapidly
and
not
entirely
orderly
for
example
standards
for
mail
address
munging
or
parsing
tend
to
vary
slightly
between
sites
and
frequently
mean
the
difference
between
finding
addresses
and
bouncing
mail
domain
names
and
computer
names
are
frequently
changed
at
sites
and
there
are
delays
in
the
propagation
of
this
data
addresses
cannot
be
resolved
when
certain
critical
computers
crash
such
as
the
receiving
computer
or
other
computers
involved
in
resolving
names
into
addresses
called
nameservers
a
whole
slew
of
problems
is
associated
with
nameservers
if
they
are
not
updated
they
will
not
find
name
addresses
and
even
the
operation
of
what
constitutes
updating
has
different
interpretations
at
different
sites
the
current
internet
mailing
and
addressing
protocols
are
slightly
anachronistic
in
that
they
were
created
when
the
network
was
somewhat
obscure
and
not
widespread
with
only
a
fraction
of
the
traffic
it
now
sees
today
a
large
proportion
of
internet
traffic
is
email
comprising
millions
of
messages
what
is
the
future
of
identification
on
the
internet
some
new
technologies
and
standards
are
introducing
facial
images
and
voice
messages
into
mail
and
these
will
improve
the
sense
of
community
that
comes
from
the
familiarity
of
identification
however
they
are
not
currently
widespread
require
large
amounts
of
data
transfer
standardized
software
and
make
some
compromises
in
privacy
promising
new
cryptographic
techniques
may
make
digital
signatures
and
digital
authentication
common
see
below
also
the
trend
in
usenet
standards
is
toward
greater
authentication
of
posted
information
on
the
other
hand
advances
in
ensuring
anonymity
such
as

privacy
what
is
privacy
on
the
internet
generally
while
privacy
has
multiple
connotations
in
society
and
perhaps
even
more
on
the
internet
in
cyberspace
most
take
it
to
mean
that
you
have
exclusive
use
and
access
to
your
account
and
the
data
stored
on
and
and
directed
to
it
such
as
email
and
you
do
not
encounter
arbitrary
restrictions
or
searches
in
other
words
others
may
obtain
data
associated
with
your
account
but
not
without
your
permission
these
ideas
are
probably
both
fairly
limiting
and
liberal
in
their
scope
in
what
most
internet
users
consider
their
private
domains
some
users
dont
expect
or
want
any
privacy
some
expect
and
demand
it
why
is
privacy
unimportant
on
the
internet
this
is
a
somewhat
debatable
and
inflammatory
topic
arousing
passionate
opinions
on
the
internet
some
take
privacy
for
granted
and
are
rudely
surprised
to
find
it
tenuous
or
nonexistent
most
governments
have
rules
that
protect
privacy
such
as
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
clause
of
the
us
constitution
adopted
by
others
but
have
many
that
are
antithetical
to
it
such
as
laws
prohibiting
secret
communications
or
allowing
wiretapping
these
rules
generally
carry
over
to
the
internet
with
few
specific
rules
governing
it
however
the
legal
repercussions
of
the
global
internet
are
still
largely
unknown
and
untested
ie
no
strong
legal
precedents
and
court
cases
the
fact
that
internet
traffic
frequently
passes
past
international
boundaries
and
is
not
centrally
managed
significantly
complicates
and
strongly
discourages
its
regulation
how
insecure
are
internet
networks
theoretically
people
at
any
site
in
the
chain
of
sites
with
access
to
hardware
and
network
media
that
transmits
data
over
the
internet
could
potentially
monitor
or
archive
it
however
the
sheer
volume
and
general
noise
inherent
to
this
data
makes
these
scenarios
highly
improbable
even
by
government
agencies
with
supposedly
vast
funding
and
resources
technologies
exist
to
tap
magnetic
fields
given
off
by
electrical
wires
without
detection
less
obscurely
any
machine
with
a
network
connection
is
a
potential
station
for
traffic
detection
but
this
scenario
requires
knowledge
and
access
to
very
lowlevel
hardware
the
network
card
to
pursue
if
even
possible
a
company
network
general
inc
is
one
of
many
that
manufactures
and
markets
sophisticated
network
monitoring
tools
that
can
filter
and
read
packets
by
arbitrary
criteria
for
troubleshooting
purposes
but
the
cost
of
this
type
of
device
is
prohibitive
for
casual
use
known
instances
of
the
above
types
of
security
breaches
at
a
major
scale
such
as
at
network
hubs
are
very
rare
the
greatest
risks
tend
to
emerge
locally
note
that
all
these
approaches
are
almost
completely
defused
with
the
use
of
cryptography
how
insecure
is
my
account
by
default
not
very
there
are
a
multitude
of
factors
that
may
reinforce
or
compromise
aspects
of
your
privacy
on
the
internet
first
your
account
must
be
secure
from
other
users
the
universal
system
is
to
use
a
password
but
if
it
is
weak
ie
easy
to
guess
this
security
is
significantly
diminished
somewhat
surprisingly
and
frighteningly
to
some
certain
users
of
the
system
particularly
the
administrator
generally
have
unlimited
access
regardless
of
passwords
and
may
grant
that
access
to
others
this
means
that
they
may
read
any
file
in
your
account
without
detection
furthermore
not
universally
known
most
unix
systems
keep
fairly
extensive
accounting
records
of
when
and
where
you
logged
in
what
commands
you
execute
and
when
they
are
executed
in
fact
login
information
is
usually
public
most
features
of
this
auditing
or
process
accounting
information
are
enabled
by
default
after
the
initial
installation
and
the
system
administrator
may
customize
it
to
strengthen
or
weaken
it
to
satisfy
performance
or
privacy
aims
this
information
is
frequently
consulted
for
troubleshooting
purposes
and
may
otherwise
be
ignored
this
data
tracks
unsuccessful
login
attempts
and
other
suspicious
activities
on
the
system
a
traditional
part
of
the
unix
system
that
tracks
user
commands
is
easily
circumvented
by
the
user
with
the
use
of
symbolic
links
described
in
man
ln
unix
implementations
vary
widely
particularly
in
tracking
features
and
new
sophisticated
mechanisms
are
introduced
by
companies
regularly
typically
system
adminstrators
augment
the
basic
unix
functionality
with
publicdomain
programs
and
locallydeveloped
tools
for
monitoring
and
use
them
only
to
isolate
suspicious
activity
as
it
arises
eg
remote
accesses
to
the
passwd
file
incorrect
login
attempts
remote
connection
attempts
etc
generally
you
should
expect
little
privacy
on
your
account
for
various
reasons
potentially
every
keystroke
you
type
could
be
intercepted
by
someone
else
system
administrators
make
extensive
backups
that
are
completely
invisible
to
users
which
may
record
the
states
of
an
account
over
many
weeks
erased
files
can
under
many
operating
systems
be
undeleted
most
automated
services
keep
logs
of
use
for
troubleshooting
or
otherwise
for
example
ftp
sites
usually
log
the
commands
and
record
the
domain
originations
of
users
including
anonymous
ones
some
software
exacerbates
these
problems
see
the

on

a
much
more
commonly
harmful
threat
there
are
multiple
ways
to
help
ensure
that
your
account
will
not
be
accessed
by
others
and
compromises
can
often
be
traced
to
failures
in
these
guidelines
choose
a
secure
password
change
it
periodically
make

to

always
do
not
leave
a

unattended
for
long
make

no
one
watches
you
when
you
type
your

avoid
password
references
in
email
be
conservative
in
the
use
of
the
rhost
file
use
utilities
like
xlock
to
protect
a
station
but
be
considerate
be
wary
of
situations
where
you
think
you
should
supply
your
password
there
are
only
several
basic
situations
where
unix
prompts
you
for
a
password
when
you
are
logging
in
to
a
system
or
changing
your
password
situations
can
arise
in
which
prompts
for
passwords
are
forged
by
other
users
especially
in
cases
where
you
are
talking
to
them
such
as
internet
relay
chat
also
be
aware
that
forged
login
screens
are
one
method
to
illegitimately

how
insecure
are
my

the
most
important
privacy
considerations
are
related
to
file
rights
and
many
lapses
can
be
traced
to
their
misunderstood
nature
or
haphazard
maintenance
be
aware
of
the
rights
associated
with
your
files
and
directories
in
unix
if
the
x
execute
right
on
your
parent
directory
is
off
for
users
groups
and
other
these
users
cannot
gain
information
on
anything
in
your

anything
less
may
allow
others
to
read
change
or
even
delete
files
in
your
home
directory
the
rights
on
a
directory
supersede
the
rights
associated
with
files
in
that
directory
for
a
directory
x
means
that
access
to
the
files
or
subdirectories
in
the

is
possible
if
you
know
their
names
to
list
the

most

accessable
only
to

but
the

varies
between

the

is
the
primary
software
developed
by
the
mit

project
which
is

by
us
government
grants
to
develop
applications
to
harness
the
power
of
networks
in
enhancing
computational
tasks
particularly
the
humancomputer
interface
the
software
implements
a
clientserver
interface
to
a
computer
via
graphical
windows
in
this
case
the
client
is
the
application
requesting
or
utilizing
graphical
resources
such
as
windows
or
a
mouse
and
the
server
is
the
machine
that
provides
them
in
many
situations
the
client
is
an
application
program
running
on
the
same
machine
as
the
server
the
great
utility
of
x
windows
comes
from
its
complete
dissociation
of
the
client
and
server
so
that
windows
may
be
broadcast
to
a
server
at
a
remote
location
from
the
client
unfortunately
this
dynamic
power
also
introduces
many
deep
intricate
and
complicated
security
considerations
the
primary
security
and
privacy
issue
associated
with
x
windows
is
that
much
more
sensitive
data
may
be
sent
over
a
network
and
over
wider
regions
than
in
the
case
where
the
human
is
situated
near
the
host
computer
currently
there
is
no
encryption
of
data
such
as
screen
updates
and
keystrokes
in
x
windows
due
to
either
intentional
design
decisions
or
unintentional
design
flaws
early
versions
of
the
x
window
system
are
extremely
insecure
anyone
with
an
account
on
the
server
machine
can
disrupt
that
display
or
read
it
electronically
based
on
access
to
the
device
by
any
regular
user
there
are
no
protections
from
this
type
of
access
in
these
versions
the
problem
arises
because
the
security
is
completely
based
on
machine
addresses
rather
than
users
such
that
any
user
at
a
trusted
machine
is
himself
trusted
quoting
from

documentation
man
xsecurity
any

when

with

the

may
prevent
some
naive
attempts
ie
those
other
than
the

the

much
more
serious

conceivable
from
similar

exploiting

inherent

how

by

not
very
the
characters
that

almost
certainly
encoded

the
american
standard
code
for

that
maps
alphabetic

and
vice

virtually
every

from
it
when
you
write

it
is
being

and
since
the

is
virtually
universal
there
is
no
intrinsic

despite
milleniums

the

persists
endlessly
on

whether
this

also
used
as
a
questionable
means
of
attacking

system

at

regularly
cooperate
to
squelch
severe

however
by
tradition
usenet

are
remarkably
tolerant

wielded

thereby

vary
widely
between

be

why
is
privacy
unstable
on
the
internet
for
the
numerous
reasons
listed
above
privacy
should
not
be
an
expectation
with
current
use
of
the
internet
furthermore
large
parts
of
the
internet
are
funded
by
the
us
nsf
national
science
foundation
which
places
certain
restrictions
on
its
use
such
as
prohibiting
commercial
use
some
highlevel
officials
in
this
and
other
government
agencies
may
be
opposed
to
emerging
techniques
to
guarantee
privacy
such
as
encryption
and
anonymous
services
historically
the
major
threats
to
privacy
on
the
internet
have
been
local
perhaps
the
most
common
example
of
this
are
the
widespread
occurrences
of
university
administrators
refusing
to
carry
some
portion
of
usenet
newsgroups
labelled
as
pornographic
the
alternative
hierarchy
in
the
usenet
system
which
has
virtually
no
restrictions
on
propagation
and
new
group
creation
is
frequently
targeted
although
this
material
may
appear
anywhere
from
the
global
point
of
view
traffic
is
generally
completely
unimpeded
on
the
internet
and
only
the
most
egregious
offenders
are
pursued
for
example
verbatim
transcriptions
of
copyrighted
material
such
as
newspaper
or
magazine
articles
are
posted
to
usenet
with
regularity
without
major
consequences
some
email
complaints
may
ensue
more
astonishing
to
some
is
that
currently
significant
portions
of
usenet
traffic
and
less
so
internet
traffic
is
comprised
of
sexuallyexplicit
digitized
images
almost
entirely
originating
from
copyrighted
material
newsgroups
such
as
altsex
regularly
have
the
highest
traffic
what
is
the
future
of
privacy
on
the
internet
some
argue
that
the
internet
currently
has
an
adequate
or
appropriate
level
of
privacy
others
will
argue
that
as
a
prototype
for
future
global
networks
it
has
woefully
inadequate
safeguards
the
internet
is
growing
to
become
a
completely
global
international
superhighway
for
data
and
this
traffic
will
inevitably
entail
data
such
as
voice
messages
postal
mail
and
many
other
items
of
extremely
personal
nature
computer
items
that
many
people
consider
completely
private
such
as
their
local
hard
drives
will
literally
be
inches
from
global
network
connections
also
sensitive
industrial
and
business
information
is
exchanged
over
networks
currently
and
this
volume
may
conceivably
merge
with
the
internet
most
would
agree
that
for
these
basic
but
sensitive
uses
of
the
internet
no
significant
mechanisms
are
currently
in
place
to
ensure
much
privacy
new
standards
are
calling
for
uniform
introduction
of
privacy
enhanced
mail
pem
which
uses
encryption
technologies
to
ensure
privacy
so
that
privacy
protection
is
automatic
and
may
significantly
improve
safeguards
the
same
technology
that
can
be
extremely
destructive
to
privacy
such
as
with
surreptitious
surveilance
can
be
overwhelmingly
effective
in
protecting
it
eg
with
encryption
some
government
agencies
are
opposed
to
unlimited
privacy
in
general
and
believe
that
it
should
lawfully
be
forfeited
in
cases
of
criminal
conduct
eg
courtauthorized
wiretapping
however
powerful
new
technologies
to
protect
privacy
on
computers
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
provoking
some
to
say
that
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
and
the
genie
cant
be
put
back
in
the
bottle
in
less
idiomatic
terms
they
believe
that
the
spread
of
strong
cryptography
is
already
underway
will
be
socially
and
technically
unstoppable
to
date
no
feasible
system
that
guarantees
both
secure
communication
and
government
oversight
has
been
proposed
the
two
goals
are
largely
incompatible
proposals
for
registration
of
secret
keys
by
d
denning
on
scicrypt
for
example
have
been
met
with
hot
controversy
at
best
and
ridicule
and
derision
at
worst
mainly
because
of
concerns
for
the
right
to
privacy
and
objections
of
inherent
feasibility
electronic
privacy
issues
and
particularly
the
proper
roles
of
networks
and
the
internet
will
foreseeably
become
highly
visible
and
explosive
over
the
next
few
years
anonymity
what
is
anonymity
on
the
internet
simply
stated
anonymity
is
the
absence
of
identity
the
ultimate
in
privacy
however
there
are
several
variations
on
this
simple
theme
a
person
may
wish
to
be
consistently
identified
by
a
certain
pseudonym
or
handle
and
establish
a
reputation
under
it
in
some
area
providing
pseudoanonymity
a
person
may
wish
to
be
completely
untraceable
for
a
single
oneway
message
a
sort
of
hitandrun
or
a
person
may
wish
to
be
openly
anonymous
but
carry
on
a
conversation
with
others
with
either
known
or
anonymous
identities
via
an
anonymous
return
address
a
user
may
wish
to
appear
as
a
regular
user
but
actually
be
untraceable
sometimes
a
user
wishes
to
hide
who
he
is
sending
mail
to
in
addition
to
the
message
itself
the
anonymous
item
itself
may
be
directed
at
individuals
or
groups
a
user
may
wish
to
access
some
service
and
hide
all
signs
of
the
association
all
of
these
uses
are
feasible
on
the
internet
but
are
currently
tricky
to
carry
out
in
practice
because
of
all
the
tracking
mechanisms
inherent
to
operating
systems
and
network
protocols
officials
of
the
nsf
and
other
government
agencies
may
be
opposed
to
any
of
these
uses
because
of
the
potential
for
abuse
nevertheless
the
inherent
facelessness
of
large
networks
will
always
guarantee
a
certain
element
of
anonymity
why
is
anonymity
unimportant
on
the
internet
anonymity
is
another
powerful
tool
that
can
be
beneficial
or
problematic
depending
on
its
use
arguably
absence
of
identification
is
important
as
the
presence
of
it
it
may
be
the
case
that
many
strong
benefits
from
electronic
anonymity
will
be
discovered
that
were
unforeseen
and
unpredicted
because
true
anonymity
has
been
historically
very
difficult
to
establish
one
can
use
anonymity
to
make
personal
statements
to
a
colleague
that
would
sabotage
a
relationship
if
stated
openly
such
as
employeremployee
scenarios
one
can
use
it
to
pass
information
and
evade
any
threat
of
direct
retribution
for
example
whistleblowers
reporting
on
government
abuses
economic
social
or
political
can
bring
issues
to
light
without
fear
of
stigma
or
retaliation
sensitive
personal
potentially
damaging
information
is
often
posted
to
some
usenet
groups
a
risky
situation
where
anonymity
allows
conversations
to
be
carried
on
completely
independent
of
the
identities
of
the
participants
some
police
departments
run
phone
services
that
allow
anonymous
reporting
of
crimes
such
uses
would
be
straightforward
on
the
network
unfortunately
extortion
and
harassment
become
more
insidious
with
assurances
of
anonymity
how
can
anonymity
be
protected
on
the
internet
the
chief
means
as
alluded
to
above
are
masking
identities
in
email
and
posting
however
anonymous
accounts
public
accounts
as
accessable
and
anonymous
as
eg
public
telephones
may
be
effective
as
well
but
this
use
is
generally
not
officially
supported
and
even
discouraged
by
some
system
adminstrators
and
nsf
guidelines
the
nonuniformity
in
the
requirements
of
obtaining
accounts
at
different
sites
and
institutions
makes
anonymous
accounts
generally
difficult
to
obtain
to
the
public
at
large
many
communications
protocols
are
inherently
detrimental
to
anonymity
virtually
every
protocol
in
existence
currently
contains
information
on
both
sender
and
receiver
in
every
packet
new
communications
protocols
will
likely
develop
that
guarantee
much
higher
degrees
of
secure
anonymous
communication
what
is
anonymous
mail
one
approach
to
anonymizing
mail
has
been
to
set
up
an
anonymous
server
that
when
activated
by
email
to
its
address
responds
by
allocating
and
supplying
an
anonymous
id
that
is
unique
to
the
person
requesting
it
based
on
his
email
address
this
will
vary
for
the
same
person
for
different
machine
address
email
originations
to
send
anonymous
mail
the
user
sends
email
directed
to
the
server
containing
the
final
destination
the
server
anonymizes
the
message
by
stripping
of
identification
information
and
forwards
the
message
which
appears
to
originate
from
the
anonymous
server
only
from
the
corresponding
anonymous
user
id
this
is
the
interactive
use
of
anonymity
or
pseudonymity
mentioned
above
another
more
fringe
approach
is
to
run
a
cypherpunk
remailer
from
a
regular
user
account
no
root
system
privileges
are
required
these
are
currently
being
pioneered
by
eric
hughes
and
hal
finney
halalumnicaltechedu
the
operator
runs
a
process
on
a
machine
that
anonymizes
mail
sent
to
him
with
certain
characteristics
that
distinguish
it
from
his
regular
incoming
mail
typically
fields
in
the
header
one
has
been
implemented
as
a
perl
script
running
on
unix
several
of
these
are
in
existence
currently
but
sites
and
software
currently
are
highly
unstable
they
may
be
in
operation
outside
of
system
administrator
knowledge
the
remailers
dont
generally
support
anonymous
return
addresses
mail
that
is
incorrectly
addressed
is
received
by
the
operator
generally
the
user
of
the
remailer
has
to
disavow
any
responsibility
for
the
messages
forwarded
through
his
system
although
actually
may
be
held
liable
regardless
these
approaches
have
several
serious
disadvantages
and
weaknesses
the
anonymous
server
approach
requires
maintaining
a
mapping
of
anonymous
ids
to
real
addresses
that
must
be
maintained
indefinitely
one
alternative
is
to
allow
deallocation
of
aliases
at
the
request
of
the
user
but
this
has
not
been
implemented
yet
although
an
unlikely
scenario
traffic
to
any
of
these
sites
could
conceivably
be
monitored
from
the
outside
necessitating
the
use
of
cryptography
for
basic
protection
local
administrators
can
shut
them
down
either
out
of
caprice
or
under
pressure
from
local
network
or
government
agencies
unscrupulous
providers
of
the
services
can
monitor
the
traffic
that
goes
through
them
most
remailers
currently
keep
logs
that
may
be
inspected
the
cypherpunk
approach
tends
to
be
highly
unstable
because
these
operators
are
basically
network
users
who
do
not
own
the
equipment
and
are
accountable
to
their

may
be
unaware
of
the
use
and
unsympathetic
to
the
philosophy
of
anonymity
when
the
operation
is
discovered
regarding
it
as
illicit
use
in
all
cases
a
high
degree
of
trust
is
placed
in
the
anonymous
server
operator
by
the
user
currently
the
most
direct
route
to
anonymity
involves
using
smtp
protocols
to
submit
a
message
directly
to
a
server
with
arbitrary
field
information
this
practice
not
uncommon
to
hackers
and
the
approach
used
by
remailers
is
generally
viewed
with
hostility
by
most
system

may

that
can
be

in
practice
this
is
generally
infeasible
and
rarely
carried
out
some

on

administrators
to
request

admonished

severely

as
revoking
the
account
all
of
this
actually
happening
occasionally
but
infrequently
see
the
sections
known
anonymous

and

and

associated
with

what
is
anonymous
posting
anonymous
servers
have
been
established
as
well
for
anonymous
usenet
posting
with
all
the
associated
caveats
above
monitored
traffic
capricious
or
risky
local
circumstances
logging
make
sure
to
test
the
system
at
least
once
by
eg
anonymous
posting
to
misctest
however
some
operators
dont
recommend
this
because
many
sites
autorespond
to
test
messages
possibly
causing
the
anonymous
server
to
allocate
anonymous
ids
for
those
machines
see
the
responsibilties
associated
with
anonymous
posting
before
proceeding
another
direct
route
involves
using
nntp
protocols
to
submit
a
message
directly
to
a
newserver
with
arbitrary
field
information
this
practice
not
uncommon
to
hackers
is
also
generally
viewed
with
hostility
by
most
system
administrators
and
similar
consequences
can
ensue
see
the
sections
known
anonymous
mail
and
posting
sites
and
responsibilities
associated
with
anonymity
why
is
anonymity
unstable
on
the
internet
as
noted
many
factors
compromise
the
anonymity
currently
available
to
the
general
internet
community
and
these
services
should
be
used
with
great
caution
to
summarize
the
technology
is
in
its
infancy
and
current
approaches
are
unrefined
unreliable
and
not
completely
trustworthy
no
standards
have
been
established
and
troubling
situations
of
loss
of
anonymity
and
bugs
in
the
software
are
prevalent
here
are
some
encountered
and
potential
bugs
one
anonymous
remailer
reallocated
already
allocated
anonymous
return
addresses
others
passed
signature
information
embedded
in
messages
unaltered
address
resolution
problems
resulting
in
anonymized
mail
bounced
to
a
remailer
are
common
forgeries
to
the
anonymous
server
itself
are
a
problem
possibly
allowing
unauthorized
users
to
potentially
glean
anon
id
email
address
mappings
in
the
alias
file
this
can
be
remedied
with
the
use
of
passwords
infinite
mail
loops
are
possible
with
chaining
remailers
source
code
is
being
distributed
tested
and
refined
for
these
systems
but
standards
are
progressing
slowly
and
weakly
the
field
is
not
likely
to
improve
considerably
without
official
endorsement
and
action
by
network
agencies
the
whole
idea
is
essentially
still
in
its
infancy
and
viewed
with
suspicion
and
distrust
by
many
on
the
internet
seen
as
illegitimate
or
favorable
to
criminality
the
major
objection
to
anonymity
over
regular
internet
use
is
the
perceived
lack
of
accountability
to
system
operators
ie
invulnerability
to
account
restrictions
resulting
from
outside
complaints
system
adminstrators
at
some
sites
have
threatened
to
filter
anonymous
news
postings
generated
by
the
prominent
servers
from
their
redistribution
flows
this
may
only
have
the
effect
of
encouraging
server
operators
to
create
less
characteristically
detectable
headers
probably
the
least
problematic
approach
and
the
most
traditional
to
usenet
is
for
individual
users
to
deal
with
anonymous
mail
however
they
prefer
eg
ignoring
it
or
filtering
it
with
kill
files
what
is
the
future
of
anonymity
on
the
internet
new
anonymous
protocols
effectively
serve
to
significantly
increase
safeguards
of
anonymity
for
example
the
same
mechanism
that
routes
email
over
multiple
hosts
thereby
threatening
its
privacy
can
also
be
used
to
guarantee
it
in
a
scheme
called
chaining
an
anonymous
message
is
passed
through
multiple
anonymous
servers
before
reaching
a
destination
in
this
way
generally
multiple
links
of
the
chain
have
to
be
broken
for
security
to
be
compromised
reencryption
at
each
link
makes
this
scenario
even
more
unlikely
even
more
significantly
the
anonymous
remailers
could
be
spread
over
the
internet
globally
so
that
local
weaknesses
such
as
corrupt
governments
or
legal
wiretapping
within
a
nation
would
be
more
unlikely
to
sacrifice
overall
security
by
message
tracing
however
remailers
run
by
corrupt
operators
are
possible
the
future
of
anonymous
services
on
the
internet
is
at
this
time
highly
uncertain
and
fraught
with
peril
while
specific
groups
seem
to
benefit
significantly
from
anonymous
posting
capabilities
many
feel
that
unlimited
newsgroup
scope
for
anonymous
posting
is
a
disruptive
and
dangerous
idea
and
detracts
from
discussions
in
serious
groups
the
introduction
of
unlimited
group
anonymity
may
have
fundamental
repercussions
on
usenet
conventions
and
distribution
mechanisms
such
as
moderated
and
alt
groups
have
had
in
the
past
for
example
as
part
of
new
group
creation
the
charter
may
specify
whether
anonymous
posting
is
unwelcome
nevertheless
the
widespread
introduction
and
use
of
anonymity
may
be
inevitable
based
on
traffic
statistics
anonymous
services
are
in
huge
demand
pervasive
and
readily
available
anonymity
could
carry
significant
and
unforeseen
social
consequences
however
if
its
use
is
continued
to
be
generally
regarded
as
subversive
it
may
be
confined
to
the
underground
the
ramifications
of
widespread
introduction
of
anonymity
to
usenet
are
still
largely
unknown
it
is
unclear
whether
it
will
provoke
signficant
amounts
of
new
traffic
or
instead
of
expansion
cause
a
shift
where
a
greater
portion
of
existing
traffic
is
anonymized
conceivably
the
services
could
play
a
role
in
influencing
future
mainstream
social
acceptance
of
usenet

what
is

these
terms
arouse
strong
feelings
by
many
on
their
meaning
especially
on
the
internet
in
the
general
news
media
in
the
past
a
person
who
uses
computers
and
networks
to
malicious
ends
such
as
breaking
into
systems
has
been
referred
to
as
a
hacker
but
most
internet
users
prefer
the
term
cracker
for
this
instead
a
hacker
is
perceived
as
a
benign
but
intensely
ambitious
curious
and
driven
computer
user
who
explores
obscure
areas
of
a
system

examplesomething
of
a

what
is
a
cypherpunk
from
the
charter
of
the
cypherpunk
mailing
list
cypherpunks
assume
privacy
is
a
good
thing
and
wish
there
were
more
of
it
cypherpunks
acknowledge
that
those
who
want
privacy
must
create
it
for
themselves
and
not
expect
governments
corporations
or
other
large
faceless
organizations
to
grant
them
privacy
out
of
beneficence
cypherpunks
know
that
people
have
been
creating
their
own
privacy
for
centuries
with
whispers
envelopes
closed
doors
and
couriers
cypherpunks
do
not
seek
to
prevent
other
people
from
speaking
about
their
experiences
or
their
opinions

is
steganography
or
the
techniques
for
not
only
pursuing
private
encrypted
communication
but
concealing
the
very
existence
of
the
communication
itself
many
new
possibilities
in
this
area
are
introduced
with
the
proliferation
of
computer
technology
for
example
it
is
possible
to
encode
messages
in
the
leastsignificant
bits
of
images
typically
the
most
noisy
in
addition
when
such
an
item
is
posted
in
a
public
place
such
as
a
newsgroup
virtually
untraceable
communication
can
take
place
between
sender
and
receiver
for
steganographic
communications
in
the
electronic
realm
one
another
possibility
is
setting
up
a
mailing
list
where
individual
messages
get
broadcast
to
the
entire
list
and
individual
users
decode
particular
messages
with

what
is
security
through
obscurity
security
through
obscurity
refers
to
the
attempt
to
gain
protection
from
system
weaknesses
by
hiding
sensitive
information
or
programs
relating
to
them
for
example
a
company
may
not
make
public
information
on
its
softwares
encryption
techniques
to
evade
attacks
based
on
knowledge
of
it
another
example
would
be
concealing
data
on
the
existence
of
security
holes
or
bugs
in
operating
systems
or
some
reliance
may
be
made
on
the
fact
that
some
standard
or
mechanism
with
potential
problems
is
serious
because
they
are
not
widely
known
or
not
widely
used
this
argument
is
occasionally
applied
to
mechanisms
for
email
and
usenet
posting
forgery
security
through
obscurity
is
regarded
as
a
very
feeble
technique
at
best
and
inappropriate

ineffective
at
worst

digitized
information
is
very
hard
to
stamp
classified
or
keep
contained
this
stuff
is
incredibly
leaky
and
volatile
its
almost
a
life
form
in
its
ability
to
selfpropagate
if
something
hits
the
net
and
its
something
which
people
on
there
find
interesting
it
will
spread
like
a
virus
of
the
mind
i
believe
you
must
simply
accept
the
idea
that
we
are
moving
into
an
environment
where
any
information
which
is
at
all
interesting
to
people
is
going
to
get
out
and
there
will
be
very
little
that
you
can
do
about
it
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
my
view
but
you
may
differ

the

perhaps

the

an
electronic
civil
rights
case
against
the
secret
service
closed
thursday
with
a
clear
statement
by
federal
district
judge
sam
sparks
that
the
service
failed
to
conduct
a
proper
investigation
in
a
notorious
computer
crime
crackdown
and
went
too
far
in
retaining
custody
of
seized

secret

special
agent
timothy

of

who
was
in

of

that
led

stoically
endured

rebuke
over
the

poor
investigation
and
abusive
computer
seizure
policies
while
the
service
has
seized
dozens
of
computers
since
the
crackdown
began
in
this
is
the
first
case
to
challenge
the
practice
sparks
grew
visibly
angry
when
it
was
established
that
the
austin
science
fiction
magazine
and
game
book
publisher
was
never
suspected
of
a
crime
and
that
agents
did
not
do
even
marginal
research
to
establish
a
criminal
connection
between
the
firm
and
the
suspected
illegal
activities
of
an
employee
or
to
determine
that
the
company
was
a
publisher
indeed
agents
testified
that
they
were
not
even
trained
in
the
privacy
protection
act
at
the
special
secret

school
on

how
long
would
it
have
taken
you
mr
foley
to
find
out
what
steve
jackson
games
did
what
it
was
asked
sparks
an
hour
was
there
any
reason
why
on
march
you
could
not
return
to
steve
jackson
games
a
copy
in
floppy
disk
form
of
everything
taken
did
you
read
the
article
in
business
week
magazine
where
it
had
a
picture
of
steve
jackson
a
lawabiding
taxpaying
citizen
saying
he
was
a
computer
crime
suspect
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
mr
foley
that
seizing
this
material
could
harm
steve
jackson
economically
foley
replied
no
sir
but
the
judge
offered
his
own
answer
you
actually
did
you
just
had
no
idea
anybody
would
actually
go
out
and
hire
a
lawyer
and
sue
you
more
than
has

feb

in
a
move
that
worried
privacy
experts
software
manufacturers
and
telephone
companies
the
fbi
proposed
legislation
to
amend
the
communications
act
of
to
make
it
easier
for
the
bureau
to
perform
electronic
wiretapping
the
proposed
legislation
entitled
digital
telephony
would
have
required
communications
service
providers
and
hardware
manufacturers
to
make
their
systems
tappable
by
providing
back
doors
through
which
law
enforcement
officers
could
intercept
communications
furthermore
this
capability
would
have
been
provided
undetectably
while
the
communications
was
in
progress
exclusive
of
any
communications
between
other
parties
regardless
of
the
mobility
of
the
target
of
the
fbis
investigation
and
without
degradation
of
service
under
the
proposal
the
department
of
justice
doj
can
keep
communications
products
off
the
market
if
it
determines
that
these
products
do
not
meet
the
dojs
own
guidelines
this
could
result
in
increased
costs
and
reduced
competitiveness
for
service
providers
and
equipment
manufacturers
since
they
will
be
unlikely
to
add
any
features
that
may
result
in
a
doj
rejection
of
their
entire
product
the
fbi
proposal
suggests
that
the
cost
of
this
wiretapping
service
to
the
bureau
would
have
to
be
borne
by
the

how
internet
anarchy
like
the
english
language
according
to
bruce
sterling
bruceswellsfcaus
the
internets
anarchy
may
seem
strange
or
even
unnatural
but
it
makes
a
certain
deep
and
basic
sense
its
rather
like
the
anarchy
of
the
english
language
nobody
rents
english
and
nobody
owns
english
as
an
englishspeaking
person
its
up
to
you
to
learn
how
to
speak
english
properly
and
make
whatever
use
you
please
of
it
though
the
government
provides
certain
subsidies
to
help
you
learn
to
read
and
write
a
bit
otherwise
everybody
just
sort
of
pitches
in
and
somehow
the
thing
evolves
on
its
own
and
somehow
turns
out
workable
and
interesting
fascinating
even
though
a
lot
of
people
earn
their
living
from
using
and
exploiting
and
teaching
english
english
as
an
institution
is
public
property
a
public
good
much
the
same
goes
for
the
internet
would
english
be
improved
if
the
the
english
language
inc
had
a
board
of
directors
and
a
chief
executive
officer
or
a
president
and
a
congress
thered
probably
be
a
lot
fewer
new
words
in
english
and
a
lot
fewer
new

avoid

give
as
much

remember
that

the
only
means
for
readers
to
judge
the
truth

that
any
inaccuracies
will
tend
to
discredit
the
entire

this
article
is
an
excerpt
from
an
issue
of
fidonews
on
individual
privacy
and
the
use
of
handles
it
accepts
the
need
of
a
system
operator
to
know
the
name
of
a
user
but
suggests
that
the
use
of
a
handle
is
analogous
to
a
request
to
withhold
the
name
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
the
article
concludes
with
a
set
of
guidelines
for
preserving
the
right
to
be
anonymous

do
i
kill
anonymous

jgreenzeuscalpolyedu
try
putting
this
in
your
kill
file
anonhj
anonymoushj
this
will
search
the
headers
of
the
messages
and
kill
any
that
contain
anon
or
anonymous
in
them
not
perfect
and
wont
kill
followups
note
that
anonymous
server
operators
have
the
capability
to
mask
anonymous
postings
under
which
the
above
method
will
not
work
so
far
this
practice
is
not
widespread
but
it
may
become
more
common
as
a
countermeasure
to
widespread
anonymous
filtering
what
is
the
history
behind
anonymous
posting
servers
originally
anonymous
posting
services
were
introduced
for
individual
particularly
volatile
newsgroups
where
anonymity
is
almost
the
preferred
method
of
communication
such
as
talkabortion
and
altsexbondage
one
of
the
first
was
one
by
dave
mack
started
in
for
altsexbondage
another
early
one
was
wizvaxmethuenmaus
run
by
stephanie
gilgut
gilgut
enterprises
but
was
disbanded
due
to
lack
of
funds
the
system
provided
anonymous
return
addresses
john
opalko
took
up
the
functions
of
this
server
including
reinstating
the
anonymous
alias
file
the
group
altpersonals
has
been
chewing
through
servers
like
theres
no
tomorrow
spurred
by
the
disappearance
of
wizvax
and
interested
in
researching
the
idea
karl
kleinpaste
karlkleinpastegodivanectarcscmuedu
developed
his
own
system
from
scratch
in
six
hours
by
this
time
the
idea
of
extending
the
server
to
new
more
mainstream
groups
was
starting
to
emerge
and
he
explored
the
possibility
partly
at
the
specific
request
by
multiple
users
for
anonymity
in
other
groups
the
intended
advantage
of
my
system
was
specifically
to
allow
multiple
group
support
with
a
single
anon
identifier
across
all
this
was
arguably
the
single
biggest
deficiency
of
previous
anon
systems
k
kleinpaste
posted
a
message
on
recnude
asking
users
whether
an
anonymous
service
would
be
welcome
there
and
judged
a
consensus
against
it
k
kleinpaste
introduced
what
he
calls
a
fire
extinguisher
to
squelch
or
plonk
abusive
users
in
response
to
complaints
and
used
this
in
three
cases
nevertheless
after
a
few
months
of
intense
traffic
he
was
eventually
overwhelmed
by
the
abuses
of
his
server
even
as
restricted
as
it
was
my
system
was
subjected
to
abuses
to
the
point
where
it
was
ordered
dismantled
by
the
facilities
staff
here
such
abuses
started
right
after
it
was
created
in
nov
johan
helsingius
julfpenetfi
set
up
the
most
controversial
anonymous
site
to
date
anonpenetfi
is
based
on
scripts
and
c
code
written
by
k
kleinpaste
and
supports
anonymized
mail
posting
and
return
addresses
he
initially
wanted
to
confine
the
service
to
scandinavian
users
but
expanded
it
to
worldwide
accessability
in
response
to
lots
of
international
requests
j
helsingius
policy
of
allowing
anonymous
posting
to
every
usenet
newsgroup
has
been
met
with
strong
and
serious
ideological
opposition
eg
by
news
adminstrators
in
newsadminpolicy
because
of
the
relative
newness
and
recent
emergence
of
the
medium
abuses
by
anonymous
posters
tend
to
have
higher
visibility
than
routine
abuses
his
total
commitment
to
preservation
of
anonymity
is
also
controversial
for
example
in
a
highly
controversial
and
publicized
case
in
feb
an
anonymous
user
posted
a
supposed
transcript
of
desperate
crew
dialogue
during
the
challenger
shuttle
disaster
via
anonpenetfi
to
sciastro
despite
that
the
transcript
had
been
posted
in
the
same
place
up
to
a
year
earlier
then
nonanonymously
and
actually
originated
not
with
the
poster
but
a
new
york
news
tabloid
subsequent
responses
consisted
largely
of
vociferous
outrage
at
the
posters
use
of
anonymity
reverberating
through
many
newsgroups
the
original
poster
using
the
same
anonymous
handle
later
conceded
that
the
story
seemed
likely
to
have
been
fabricated
suggesting
the
plausible
possibility
that
the
original
intent
was
not
to
provoke
outrage
but
gauge
reactions
on
the
authenticity
of
the
story
albeit
crudely
free
of
personal
risk
from
perceived
association
with
the
item
the
ensuing
commotion
generated
queries
for
the
original
article
by
lateentering
readers
the
anonymous
user
later
posted
deliberately
offensive
comments
at
his
detractors
despite
piercingly
irate
and
outraged
complaints
and
even
the
vocal
opposition
and
verbal
abuse
of
k
kleinpaste
and
eminent
news
operators
j
helsingius
has
largely
avoided
use
of
the
fire
extingisher
and
the
group
bouncer
mechanisms
that
limit
the
scope
of
the
service
as
of
march
the
anonpenetfi
site
is
best
described
as
inundated
it
has
registered
over
users
in
its
initial
three
months
of
operation
forwards
messages
a
day
and
approximately
of
all
usenet
postings
are
anonymized
through
the
site
the
immense
popularity
is
probably
largely
due
to
the
capability
for
global
anonymity
which
has
allowed
users
to
find
creative
uses
in
diverse
areas
not
previously
envisioned
johan
helsingius
has
been
subject
to
extraordinary
pressure
to
dismantle
his
server
in
feb
at
one
point
k
kleinpaste
threatened
publicly
to
organize
a
sort
of
vigilante
group
of
irate
news
operators
to
send
out
revocation
commands
on
all
messages
originating
from
the
site
j
helsingius
has
also
alluded
to
threats
of
flooding
the
server
the
server
has
crashed
several
times
at
least
once
due
to
a
saturation
mailbombing
through
it
by
an
anonymous
user
mr
helsingius
reports
spending
up
to
hours
per
day
answering
email
requests
alone
associated
with
the
services
administration
in
response
to
the
serious
threats
he
disabled
global
group
access
temporarily
for
one
week
and
encouraged
his
users
to
defend
the
service
publicly
based
on
fastmoving
dialogue
and
creative
suggestions
by
cypherpunks
j
helsingius
has
identified
many
security
weaknesses
and
valuable
new
features
for
the
service
and
is
currently
in
the
process
of
code
development
and
testing
he
is
planning
on
upgrading
the
ibm
compatible
machine
to
a
soon
to
handle
the
voluminous
load
and
is
considering
integrating
a
new
system
with
very
sophisticated
functionality
including
multiple
email
aliases
alias
allocation
control
publickey
encryption
etc
a
very
sophisticated
anonymous
posting
system
was
set
up
in
dec
by
d
clunie
dcluniepaxtpacomau
that
used
cryptography
in
both
directions
tofrom
the
server
for
the
highest
degree
of
confidentiality
seen
so
far
however
it
was
running
on
a
public
access
account
and
he
had
to
shut
it
down
after
only
several
weeks
upon
receiving
requests
and
conditions
apparently
ultimately
originating
from
nsf
representatives
d
clunie
has
released
the
software
to
the
public
domain
recently
the
idea
of
a
newsgroup
devoted
to
whistleblowing
on
government
abuses
has
received
wide
and
focused
attention
and
group
formation
is
currently
underway
in
the
basic
scenario
the
group
would
allow
people
to
post
pseudonymously
using
remailers
and
even
establish
reputations
based
on
their
authentifiable
digital
signatures
the
traffic
may
eventually
reach
reporters
in
the
mainstream
news
media
deltortoaolcom
has
volunteered
to
attack
multiple
aspects
of
this
project
including
distributing

on

what
is
the
value
of
anonymity
kondaredpurccvmbitnet
i
think
anonymous
posts
do
help
in
focusing
our
attention
on
the
content
of
ones
message
sure
lot
of
anonymous
posts
are
abusive
or
frivolous
but
in
most
cases
these
are
by
users
who
find
the
anon
facility
novel
once
the
novelty
wears
off
they
are
stopping
their
pranks
morganengrukyedu

i
dont
mind
seeing
the
miscellaneous
hatredprejudiceracism
those
things
are
part
of
our
nature
however
the
notion
of
providing
anonymitys
shield
for
these
ideas
repulses
me
if
they
have
such
strong
feelings
why
cant
they
put
their
names
on
their
postings
quite
frankly
i
loathe
communication
with
people
who
refuse
to
use
their
names
dcluniepaxtpacomau
david

many
seem
to
question
the
value
of
anonymity
but
who
are
they
to
say
what
risks
another
individual
should
take
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
rather
conservative
society
that
we
live
in
holding
certain
views
making
certain
statements
adopting
a
certain
lifestyle
are
likely
to
result
in
public
censure
ridicule
loss
of
status
employment
or
even
legal
action
given
the
heterogeneity
of
the
legal
jurisdictions
from
where
the
many
contributors
to
usenet
post
who
knows
what
is
legal
and
what
is
not
some
say
that
anonymous
posters
are
cowards
and
should
stand
up
and
be
counted
perhaps
that
is
one
point
of
view
but
what
right
do
these
detractors
have
to
exercise
such
censorship
from
dougccysuedu
doug
sewell
why
is
it
censorship
to
not
expect
someone
to
speak
for
themselves
without
the
cloak
of
anonymity
this
is
at
best
a
lame
argument
you
tell
me
why
what
you
have
to
say
requires
anonymity
and
you
tell
me
why
the
wishes
of
a
majority
of
nonanonymous
users
of
a
newsgroup
should
be
disregarded
when
they
dont
want
anonymous
posts
anonymous
users
have
less
rights
than
any
others
they
are
not
legitimate
usenet
participants
i
would
not
honor

or

from

i
can
think
of
no
disadvantage
caused
by
anon
posting
sites
that
doesnt
already
exist
other
than
the
fact
that
they
do
make
more
naive
net
users
who
dont
know
how
to
post
anonymously
the
old
way
more
prone
to
do
it
from
mandelnetcomcom
tom

i
cannot
speak
for
others
but
i
regard
anonymous
postings
in
a
serious
discussion
as
pretty
much
worthless
views
that
hide
behind
the
veil
of
anon
are
hardly
worth
the
trouble
of
reading
hank
pankey
since
i
began
posting
anonymously
to
show
support
for
general
principles
of
personal
privacy
i
have
been
subject
to
far
more
abuse
and
attack
than
i
ever
received
before
people
seem
to
find
it
easier
to
flame
and
insult
someone
whose
name
they
dont
know
perhaps
its
easier
to
pretend
that
there
is
no
person
behind
the
email
address
who
feels
the
sting
of
abusive
comments
anonymity
does
hinder
some
methods
of
controlling
other
posters
actions
people
who
seek
such
control
will
naturally
oppose
it
from
instead
of
making
this
a
freeer
medium
by
allowing
posters
to
protect
themselves
with
anonymity
simply
require
that
all
posters
be
prepared
to
discuss
their
sources
of
information
and
take
the
heat
for
unsubstantiated
dribble
this
seems
to
be
the
way
things
are
currently
done
xtkmgtrentuca
kate
gregory
in
misckids
there
are
three
threads
going
on
started
by
anonymous
posters
one
was
about
changing
jobs
so
as
to
work
less
hours
job
sharing
and
so
on
from
a
woman
who
didnt
want
anyone
at
her
current
place
of
work
to
know
she
was
thinking
of
looking
for
work
elsewhere
the
next
was
from
a
woman
who
is
thinking
of
having
a
baby
sometime
soon
and
doesnt
want
coworkers
friends
family
etc
etc
to
know
all
about
it
but
who
wants
advice
the
third
is
about
sex
after
parenthood
actually
this
was
started
by
people
posting
in
the
usual
way
but
then
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
anonymous
posting
service
might
let
more
people
participate
misckids
doesnt
seem
to
be
suffering
any
harm
from
the
presence
of
anonymous
posters
in
fact
it
seems
to
have
been
helped
by
it
hoeyzogwargetlarmymil
dan
hoey
while
there
has
never
been
any
real
security
against
anonymous
or
forged
postings
on
usenet
the
process
has
until
now
been
sufficiently
inconvenient
errorprone
and
undocumented
to
limit
its
use
by
persons
who
have
not
learned
the
culture
of
the
net
on
the
other
hand
a
recent
use
of
the
anonymous
posting
service
on
scimath
seemed
seemed
to
be
a
student
asking
help
on
a
homework
problem
it
has
now
been
attributed
to
a
teacher
asking
for
an
explanation
of
a
dubious
answer
in
his
teaching
guide
he
says
his
news
posting
is
broken
so
he
is
using
the
anonymous
service
as
a
mailtonews
gateway
karl
barrus
some
argue
that
the
opinions
of
the
people
who
hide
behind
a
veil
of
anonymity
are
worthless
and
that
people
should
own
up
to
their
thoughts
i
agree
with
the
latter
point
in
an
ideal
world
we
would
all
be
sitting
around
engaging
in
socratic
dialogues
freely
exchanging
our
opinions
in
an
effort
to
learn
but
in
an
ideal
world
nobody
will
threaten
you
for
your
thoughts
or
ridicule
you
but
we
live
in
a
world
where
the
people
who
dont
agree
with
you
may
try
to
harm
you
lets
face
it
some
people
arent
going
to
agree
with
your
opinion
no
matter
how
logically
you
try
to
present
it
or
how
reasoned
out
it
may
be
this
is
sad
since
it
does
restrict
people
from
voicing
their
opinions
redredpollneoucomedu
richard
e
depew
the
consensus
seems
to
be
that
a
general
anonymous
posting
service
such
as
that
at
anonpenetfi
seems
sufficiently
corrosive
of
the
trust
and
civility
of
the
net
that
this
particular
experiment
should
be
ended
perhaps
the
next
time
the
question
comes
up
we
can
say
we
tried
it
we
learned
it
does
more
harm
than
good
and
we
stopped
it

what
a

for

do
people
really
say
different
things
to
each
other
based
upon
whether
their
identity
is
or
isnt
known
are
people
really
so
affected

what

say
that
the

is
labeled

most
importantly
on
a

that
prizes
itself
on
the
freedom

that
it
enjoys
is
there
really
such
a
thing

then
out

imho
worse
it
looks
like

gonna
get
stuck
with
these
things
and
as
much
as
i
dont
like
the
idea
of

like
this
becoming
the
norm
i
dont
really
think
theres
much
to
be
done

its
obvious
that
anyone
who
wants

can
set

i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
hold
some
controversial
opinions
indeed
im
sure
that
none
of
us
are
completely
orthodox
in
our
opinions
however
ive
received
hundreds
of
anonymous
email
messages
over
the
last
few
years
fewer
than
of
them
were
reasonable
posts
made
with
good
motives
its
getting
more
and
more
difficult
to
remember
why
we
need
anonymity
at
all
the
abusers
are
once
again
lousing
things
up
for
those
who
truly
need
the
service
or
those
who
would
put
it
to
good
use
im
not
suggesting
that
we
should
ban
anonymous
servers
as
ive
said
there
are
several
situations
in
which
anonymity
is
a
good
thing
tm
however
the
notion
that
anonymitys
shield
should
be
automatically
extended
to
every
usenet
discussion
is
ridiculous
it
opens
the
door
to
further
abuse
twpierceunixamherstedu
tim
pierce
of
course
how
does
one
determine
whether
a
group
requests
the
service
a
flat
majority
of
posters
voting
in
favor
a
positive
margin
of
votes
or
what
no
one
speaks
for
a
newsgroup
im
not
convinced
by
the
arguments
that
an
anonymous
posting
service
for
all
newsgroups
is
inherently
a
bad
idea
simply
because
its
a
diversion
from
the
status
quo
since
the
status
quo
previously
permitted
anonymous
posting
to
no
newsgroups
any
anonymous
posting
service
would
reject
the
status
quo
hartmanulogicuucp
richard

it
is
facist
to
suggest
that
a

is
best

of
having
them
forced
upon

ogilquadsuchicagoedu

the
service
provides
a
mechanism
for

since
most
usenet
readers
dont
know
john
smith
from
jane
doe
except
by
their
opinions
and
their
address
the
effect
of
having
an
anonymous
posting
to
which
mail
replies
can
be
directed
is
minimal
except
for
those
who
personally
know
the
posterand
the
lack
of
anonymity
could
be
serious
any
mechanism
like
this
is
liable
to
abuse
but
the
benefits
as
well
as
the
costs
must
be
weighed
limiting
the
service
to
alt
groups
or
specific
groups
would
not
help
those
who
want

sensitive
issues
in
more
professional
newsgroups

tarlswstratuscom
tarl
neustaedter
an
additional
point
is
that
some
of
us
find
anonimity
in
technical
matters
to
be
profoundly
offensive
anonimity
in
different
forums
has
different
meanings
if
i
get
a
phone
call
from
someone
who
wont
identify
himself
i
hang
up
if
i
get
us
mail
with
no
return
address
it
goes
into
the
garbage
unopened
if
someone
accosts
me
in
the
street
while
wearing
a
mask
i
back
away
carefully
and
expecting
violence
in
a
technical
discussion
anonimity
means
that
the
individual
isnt
willing
to
associate
himself
with
the
matter
being
discussed
which
discredits
his
utterances
and
makes
listening
to
them
a
waste
of
time
anonimity
leads
to
fun
psych
experiments
the
literature
is
filled
with
all
the
various
things
that
people
will
do
anonymously
that
they
wont
otherwise
including
one
notorious
study
involving
torture
that
would
not
have
passed

ethical
standards

you

have
never
submitted
an
article
to
a
refereed
journal
where
you
will
receive
anonymous
reviews
through
a

the
editor
that
behaves
much
like
the
one
in

eg
you
may
reply
and
the

will
maintain

issue
anonymously
with

person
who
approaches
you

it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
the
default
should
be
not
to
allow
anonymous
postings
in
a
newsgroup
the
usenet
has
always
operated
on
the
principle
that
the
status
quo
should
be
kept
unless
theres
a
large
number
of
people
who
want
to
change
it
if
someone
really
needs
to
post
a
message
anonymous
in
a
newsgroup
in
which
this
usually
isnt
done
they
can
usually
find
someone
on
the
net
to
do
this
for
them
they
dont
need
an
automated
service
to
do
it
and
the
automated
service
is
by
its
nature
incapable
of
making
the
judgment
call
necessary
to
decide
whether
a
particular
posting
really
needs
to
be
anonymous
from
twpierceunixamherstedu
tim
pierce
for
any
newsgroup
you
name
i
bet
i
can
envision
a
scenario
involving
a
need
for
secrecy
if
an
accurate
contentbased
filter
of
each
anonymous
posting
could
be
devised
to
screen
out
those
that
dont
require
secrecy
wonderful
but
it
cant
be
done

if
a
newsgroup
wants
to
be
noise
and
nuisancefree
then
it
should
call
for
moderation
this
should
happen
on
a
pernewsgroup
basis
and
not
as
a
general
usenet
ban
on
anonymous
postings
of
course
one
principle
of
moderation
might
be
to
keep
out
all
anonymous
postings
and
could
be
achieved
automatically
it
would
still
be
moderation

i
would
prefer
moderation
criteria
being
based
on
actual
content

a
clunie
dcluniepaxtpacomau
if
a
group
doesnt

to
receive
certain
posts
it
should
become
moderated

are
clearly
defined
mechanisms
on
nonalt
groups
for
this
to
take
place
an
automated
moderator
excluding
posts
from
certain
eg
anonymous
sites
or
individuals
could
easily
be
established
if
anyone
wants
to
take
such
a
draconian
approach
then
they
are

to
do
so

to
them

if
i
will
be
reading
their
group
from

dave

what
possible
need
would
someone
have
for
posting
anonymously
to
a
sci
group
sure
most
adults
are
willing
to
post
under
their
own
names
why
would
they
want
to
hide
behind
an
anonymous
posting
service
ashamed
of
what
they
have
to
say
or
just
trying
to
rile
people
without
fear
of
being
identified
anonymous
posting
have
their
place
in
certain
groups
if
i
or
anyone
else
needs
to
tell
you
what
those
groups
are
then
youve
been
on
another
planet
breathing
exotic
gases
for
too
long
from
karlkleinpastecscmuedu
its
bloody
fascinating
that
all
the
proponents
of
unimpeded
universal
anon
posting
access
cant
seem
to
find
any
middle
ground
at
all
why
is
there
such
a
perception
of
absolutism
where
does
this
instant
gratification
syndrome
come
from
i
want
anon
access
and
i
want
it
now
who
are
the
control
freaks
here
from
remember
this
is
a
newsgroup
for
posters
writing
about
scientific
issues
anonymous
discussion
of
scientific
issues
leads
to
bad
science
from
noringnetcomcom
jon
noring
though
many
have
personal
philosophical
arguments
against
anonymous
posters
their
arguments
have
not
been
compelling
enough
to
convince
me
that
omninewsgroup
anonymous
posting
should
be
banned
or
severely
restricted
though
i
cannot
prove
it
it
seems
to
me
that
those
who
do
not
like
anonymous
posting
in
principle
do
so
for
reasons
that
are
personal
read
psychological
discomfort
rather
than
for
reasons
related
to
maintaining
the
integrity
of
usenet
remember
it
is
impossible
to
be
able
to
ascertain
all
the
conceivable
and
legitimate
motives
for
anonymous
posting
to
newsgroups
one
normally
would
not
deem
to
be
sensitive
in
general
i
fear
even
letting
newsgroup
readers
vote
on
either
allowing
or
not
allowing
anonymous
posting
since
a
priori
they
cannot
know
all
the
motives
of
legitimate
posters
and
i
do
not
believe
that
any
system
should
ever
be
instituted
that
would
inhibit
the
posting
of
legitimate
and
informative
posts

i
think
that
what
these
points
show
clearly
is
that
an
anonymous
posting
service
has
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
both
towards
its
clients
and
towards
the
net
as
a
whole
such
a
service
should
imho
have
a
set
of
welldefined
rules
and
a
contract
that
its
clients
should
sign
under
the
terms
of
which
they
are
assured
anonymity
from
is
the
problem
that
some
are
used
to
punishing
posters
who
are
upsetting
in
some
vague
way
by
complaining
to
the
usually
acquiescent
sysadmin
or
organizations
that
the
poster
belongs
to
that
surely
is
the
most
gutless
approach
to
solving
problems
but
my
experience
on
the
net
shows
that
the
same
users
who
vilify
anonymous
postings
are
the
first
to
write
obsessively
detailed
grievances
to
the
posters
supervisor
when
his
or
her
tranquility
is
disturbed
by
some
intrusive
or
subversive
post
or
another
anonymous
postings
prevent
just
this
kind
of
intimidation
from
gandalfcyberspaceorg
eric
schilling
the
main
point
i
would
like
to
make
here
is
that
while
we
can
go
through
and
revise
the
news
sw
to
reject
anon
posts
to
technical
newsgroups
or
some
such
thing
i
think
the
attempt
will
prove
futile
each
attempt
to
modify
news
can
result
in
a
changed
approach
by
anon
service
providers
to
thwart
the
change
i
think
this
would
be
pointless
from

i
have
tried
to
stay
out
of
this
discussion
and
see
where
the
discussion
leads
but
now
i
rally
feel
like
i
have
to
speak
up
i
have
repeatedly
made
clear
that
i
do
block
users
if
they
continue
their
abuse
after
having
been
warned
in
many
cases
the
users
have
taken
heed
of
the
warning
and
stopped
and
in
some
cases
even
apologized
in
public
and
when
the
warning
has
not
had
the
desired
effect
i
have
blocked
a
number
of
users
i
have
also
blocked
access
to
groups
where
the
readership
has
taken
a
vote
to
ban
anonymous
postings
although
i
feel
changing
the
newsgroup
status
to
moderated
is
the
only
permanent
solution
for
newsgroups
that
want
to
formalize
discussion
redredpollneoucomedu
richard

does
this
mean
that
you
are
volunteering
to
issue
a
request
for
discussion
to
ban
anonymous
postings
or
to
moderate
each
of
the
newsgroups
that
your
server
can
reach
i
dont
think
so
but
this
illustrates
the
trouble
that
your
server
is
causing
please
listen
to
the
consensus
of
the
news
administrators
in
this
group
any
newsgroup
should
be
consulted
before
letting
your
server
post
messages
to
that
group
from
alexander
eichener
there
is
no
pompous
consensus
of
the
news
administrators
here
maybe
you
would
like
to
invent
one
there
is
a
sizeable
number
of
people
who
are
concerned
about
the
possible
and
to
a
minor
extent
about
the
actual
abuse
of
the
server
as
it
is
configured
now
these
concerns
are
respectable
johan
is
dealing
with
them
there
are
some
few
who
rage
with
foam
before
their
mouth
and
condemn
the
service
altogether
and
a
number
who
defend
it
pointing
out
like
kate
gregory
that
even
a
group
like
misckids
can
benefit
from
pseudonymous
postings
from
julfpenetfi
johan
helsingius
i
have
answered
a
lot
of
personal
mail
related
to
server
abuse
and
as
a
result
of
that
blocked
a
number
of
abusive
users
i
have
also
withdrawn
the
service
from
several
newsgroups
where
the
users
have
taken
a
vote
on
the
issue
i
have
not
made
any
comments
on
newsadminpolicy
partly
because
the
newlyimplemented
password
feature
as
a
emergency
measure
against
a
security
hole
has
kept
me
really
busy
answering
user
queries
the
last
two
weeks
and
partly
because
i
feel
it
is
not
for
me
to
justify
the
service
but
for
the
users
the
problem
with
newsadminpolicy
is
that
the
readership
is
rather
elective
representing
people
whith
a
strong
interest
in
centralised
control
from
hartmanulogicuucp
richard
m

this
seems
to
be
a

bigoted
attitude
i
would
consider
that
this
group
is
for
anyone
who
wishes
to
discuss
how
the
net
should
be
controlled
saying
that
we
only
have
an
interest
in
centralized
control
is
a
clear
indication
of
bias
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
join
in
the
discussions
here
to
promote
your
views
on
control
jbuckohmberkeleyedu
this
whole
debate
is
a
lot
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
because
even
if
you
all
decide
to
ban
anonymous
posting
servers
it
is
not
enforceable
the
only
people
who
conceivably
could
enforce
retrictions
are
those
that
control
the
international
links
policy
changes
should
be
made
by
cooperation
not
by
attempting
to
dictate
you
need
to
persuade
those
who
run
the
services
to
act
like
this
through
friendly
persuasion
not
by
trying
to
beat
them
over
the

i
am
finding
this
bias
against

boring
our
friend
posting
through
penet
has
a
point
the
old
guard
would
like
to
keep
their
network
the
way
it
always
has
been
and
this
new
thing
these
pseudonymous
servers
cuts
into
their
turf
so
they
whine
and
bitch
about
it
and
every
time
theres
the
slightest
abuse
such
as
somebodys
sig
being
too
long
they
try
to
parlay
that
into
an
argument
against
pseudonymity
ill
go
on
record
as
saying
three
cheers
for
the
admins
at
anon
servers
like
penet
pax
and
and
for
all
the
access
service
providers
who
are
willing
to
preserve
their
clients
privacy
and
a
pox
on
those
who
try
to
defeat
and
restrict
pseudonymity

i
must

astonishment

see
the
value

circumstances

believe
strongly
that
these

be

fail
to
see
what
good
you

accomplishing

indeed
surmise
that
you
will
cause
many
people
inconvenience
and
annoyance
by
hiding
the
anonymity
of
postings
from
your
anonymous
site
would
you
care
to
justify

i
thought
i
was
out
of
reach
here
in
australia
too
unfortunately
one
of
the
us
sites
involved
in
the
usaus
feed
complained
to
the
australian
academic
reasearch
network
through
whom
my
site
is
connected
not
about
anything
in
particular
just
the
concept
of
anonymous
mail
having
no
redeeming
features
and
consuming
a
narrow
bandwidth
link
with
which
i
cant
argue
and
that
was
that
stop
the
service
or
face
disconnection
i
consider
the
demise
of
my
service
to
have
been
rather
unfortunate
and
i
wish
the
finnish
remailer
luck
it
is
a
pity
that
there
are
very
few
if
any
similar
services
provided
with
in
the
us
i
guess
thats
the
benefit
of
having
a
constitution
that
guarantees
one
freedom
of
speech
and
a
legal
and
political
system
that
conspires
to
subvert
it
in
the
name
of
the
public
good
what
is
going
on
with
anonpenetfi
run
by
j
helsingius
from
karlkleinpastecscmuedu
funny
how
beating
the
rest
of
the
usenet
over
the
head
with
a
stick
is
ok
if
its
anonpenetfi
and
universal
anon
access
but
somehow
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
same
equation
not
even
arguing
to
shut
it
off
entirely
but
rather
just
to
have
some
control
applied
to
the
abuses
that
manifest
themselves
arent
allowed
to
do
that
i
have
written
to
johan
several
times
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
he
used
to
reply
to
me
quite
readily
after
all
i
was
the
source
of
the
software
as
originally
delivered
to
him
he
used
to
be
downright
prompt
about
replying
to
me
funny
now
hes
being
an
impolite
bastard
who
doesnt
answer
mail
atall
even
when
it
consists
of
really
very
civil
queries
from
julfpenetfi
johan
helsingius
in
your
mail
you
told
me
you
sent
me
one
or
more
messages
on
feb
feb
and
the
server
was
down
and
the
flood
of
mail
that
resulted
from
the
server
coming
up
again
crashed
my
own
mail
host
the
problem
was
aggregated
by
an
abusive
user
sending
thousands
of
messages
to
another
user
filling
up
that
users
mailbox
the
bounce
messages
ended
up
in
my
mailbox
overflowing
my
local
disk
as
well
i
can
only
suppose
that
your
message
got
lost
in
that
hassle
as
i
have
tried
to
answer
as
much
as
possible
of
the
anonrelated
messages
i
get
from
routine
misaddessed
messages
to
complaints
about
the
service
on
the
average
i
spend
hours
per
day
answering
anonrelated
messages
from
karlkleinpastecscmuedu
why
is
it
that
everybody
else
has
to
put
up
with
the
impoliteness
and
insensitivity
of
the
misuse
of
anonpenetfi
whose
definitions
of
polite
and
sense
apply
and
why
why
is
universal
anon
access
considered
to
be
within
the
realm
of
this
fuzzy
concept
of
politeness
in
the
first
place
i
think
johan
has
long
since
crossed
the
line
into
being
a
rude
bastard
and
i
told
him
so
in
private
mail
a
little
while
ago
at
this
point
i
deeply
regret
a
having
created
an
anonymous
system
supporting
newsgroup
and
b
having
given
the
code
to
johan
i
didnt
copyright
it
but
i
thought
that
some
concept
of
politeness
and
good
sense
might
follow
it
to
new
homes
interesting
that
johans
ideas
of
politeness
and
good
sense
seem
to
have
nearly
no
interesection
with
mine
i
could
even
cope
with
universal
anon
access
if
johan
would
be
willing
to
engage
in
abuse
control
but
somehow
that
seems
to
be
outside
the
range
of
reality
from
julfpenetfi
johan
helsingius
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
convey
how
sad
and
upset
your
message
made
me
i
do
to
some
extent
understand
your
feelings
but
it
still
feels
really
bad
running
the
server
requires
getting
used
to
a
lot
of
flames
but
mindlessly
abusive
hate
mail
is
so
much
easier
to
deal
with
than
something
like
this
as
i
do
respect
and
value
your
views
and
opinions
to
a
high
degree
no
im
not
asking
for
sympathy
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
am
really
giving
your
views
quite
a
lot
of
weight
when
i
asked
for
the
software
i
was
actually
only
going
to
provide
the
service
to
scandinavian
users
but
a
lot
of
people
requested
that
i
keep
the
service
open
to
the
international
community
i
now
realize
that
i
ought
to
have
contacted
you
at
that
point
to
ask
how
you
feel
about
me
using
your
stuff
in
such
a
context
again
i
really
want
to
apologise
and
i
will
replace
the
remaining
few
pieces
of
code
thet
still
stem
from
your
system
unfortunately
there
is
no
way
to
remove
the
ideas
and
structure
i
got
from
you
again
i
am
really
sorry
that
the
results
of
your
work
ended
up
being
used
in
a
way
that
you
dont
approve
of
and
i
will
be
giving
a
lot
of
hard
thought
to
the
possibility
of
shutting
down
the
server
alltogether
from
karlkleinpastecscmuedu
i
think
im
feeling
especially
rude
and
impolite
if
its
good
for
johan
its
good
for
me
after
all
he
didnt
ask
the
greater
usenet
whether
universal
anon
access
was
a
good
idea
he
just
did
it
yes
im
a
seriously
rude
pain
in
the
ass
now
and
i
think
ill
arm
the
usenet
death
penalty
slightly
modified
not
for
strategic
wholesite
attack
but
tactical
assault
just
destruction
only
outside
alt
too
lets
say
to
parrot
this
linepeople
have
been
doing
things
like
the
udp
that
is
cancelling
others
postings
for
years
no
one
could
ever
stop
them
and
its
only
politeness
and
good
sense
that
has
prevented
them
up
to
now
in
fact
i
have
people
who
have
expressed
privately
the
desire
and
ability
to
arm
the
udp
ps
no
in
fact
there
are
not
newsadmins
ready
to
arm
the
udp
it
would
be
amusing
to
know
how
many
people
gulped
hard
when
they
read
that
though
i
dont
see
it
as
any
different
from
johans
configuration
pps
now
that
ive
calmed
some
fears
by
the
above
ps
there
are
newsadmins
ready
to
arm
the
udp
theyve
asked
for
my
code
i
havent
sent
it
yet
only
one
site
would
be
necessary
to
bring
anonpenetfi
to
a
screeching
halt
anyone
can
implement
the
udp
on
their
own
if
they
care
to
politeness
and
good
sense
prevents
them
from
doing
so
i
wonder
how
long
before
one
form
of
impoliteness
brings
on
another
form
from
julfpenetfi
johan
helsingius
it
would
be
trivially
easy
to
bring
anonpenetfi
to
a
screeching
halt
in
fact
it
has
happened
a
couple
of
times
already
but
as
we
are
talking
threats
here
let
me
make
one
as
well
a
very
simple
one
if
somebody
uses
something
like
the
udp
or
maliciously
brings
down
anonpenetfi
by
some
other
means
it
will
stay
down
but
i
will
let
the
users
know
why
and
name
the
person
who
did
it
ok
as
somebody
said
on
this
thread
you

some
important

about
my
personal
lifecareerjob
were
resolved
due
to
kind

of

who
had
been

similar

i

in

anon
service
is
a
great
in
my
opinion
although
like
any
tool
some
people
will
not
use

i
suggest
that
it
should
be
kept

wasting

important

saving
lives
i
think
from
elisa
j
collins
i
have
been
informed
that
the
anonymous
posting
service
to
many
newsgroups
has
been
turned
off
as
a
result
of
discussions
in
this
newsgroup
over
people
abusing
it
i
had
been
posting
to
a
nontechnical
misc
newsgroup
about
an
intimate
topic
for
which
i
felt
i
required
privacy
i
have
received
immeasurable
help
from
the
people
in
that
newsgroup
and
i
have
never
used
anonymity
to
behave
in
an
abusive
immature
or
unethical

toward

please
folks
believe
me
i

statement
by
the
press
secretary
the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the

and
groups
that
advocate
the

committed
to
working
with
the
private

to
spur
the
development
of
a
national

infrastructure
which
will
use
new
telecommunications

to
give
americans
unprecedented

superhighways
will
transmit

since
encryption
technology
will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop
consistent
comprehensive

about
the

telecommunications
initiative
q
does
this
approach
expand
the
authority
of
government
agencies
to
listen
in

conversations
a
no
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
q
who
will
run
the
keyescrow
data
banks
a
the
two
keyescrow
data
banks
will
be
run
by
two
independent
entities
at
this
point
the
department
of
justice
and
the
administration
have
yet
to
determine
which
agencies
will
oversee
the
keyescrow
data
banks
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
q
whose
decision
was
it
to
propose
this
product
a
the
national
security
council
the
justice
department
the
commerce
department
and
other
key
agencies
were
involved
in
this
decision
this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the
chip
manufacturer
that
produces
them
q
who
provides
the
clipper
chip
a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their
facility
in
torrance
california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of
these

i
do
not
agree
at
all
with
what
went
on
in
this
case
and
neither
will
most
of
you
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
it
did
happen
right
here
in
america
even
about
three
or
four
years
ago
there
was
a
rather
nasty
custody
case
in
or
around
washington
dc
the
upshot
was
an
exhusband
was
suing
for
visitation
rights
which
were
granted
the
woman
believed
that
the
man
had
been
sexually
molesting
her
children
much
like
allenfarrow
but
not
as
famous
anyhows
she
spirits
away
the
kids
and
refuses
to
tell
the
court
where
they
are
and
denies
him
visitation
rights
she
keeps
her
mouth
shut
and
what
happens
she
sits
in
jail
for
almost
a
year
on
contempt
of
court
until
the
legislature
passes
a
special
law
limiting
the
time
a
person
can
be
held
if
they
hadnt
passed
the
law
shed
most
likely
still
be
there
the
kids
were
in
new
zealand
i
belive
now
story
finished
commetary
starting
imho
the
only
reason
the
legislature
moved
was
because
there
was
an
outpouring
of
public
sympathy
for
this
woman
most
people
believed
she
was
right
and
were
outraged
not
likely
to
happen
for
joe
random
drug
dealer
child
molester
or
perfectly
innocent
privacy
lover
who
might
have
something
to
hide
innocent
until
proven
guilty
doesnt
mean
you
get
to
walk
out
of
court
humming
a
happy
tune
because
the
fbi
cant
read
your
disk
just
ask
those
held
for
contempt
those
who
cant
make
bail
etc
etc
again
i
disagree
totally
with
the
concept
of
holding
someone
based
on
suspicion
but
people
who
keep
thinking
that
it
wont
happen
are
bound
to
get
a
rude
shock
when
it
does
also
not
a
lawyer
etc
but
if
i
remember
correctly
the
contempt
of
court
business
is
used
in
order
to
compel
cooperation
with
what
is
perhaps
questionably
different
issue
the
legitimate
business
of
that
court
quite
literally
the
party
is
found
guilty
of
holding
the
court
in
contempt
now
the
original
scheme
as
suggested
here
would
be
to
have
the
key
disappear
if
certain
threatening
conditions
are
met
once
the
key
is
gone
there
is
no
question
of
contempt
of
court
as
there
is
nothing
to
compell
the
key
is
no
longer
there
to
be
produced
obstruction
of
justice
would
be
a
different
issue
but
if
the
suspect
in
question
would
have
some
legitmate
reason
to
protect
his
data
from
prying
eyes
however
extenuated
i
think
that
this
charge
would
be
a
hard
nut
to
make
perhaps
it

a

the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as

the

is
conducting

ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted

the

what
would
they
have
to
do
to

a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court

to
do
the

in

they
would
then
present

obtain
the

for
the

how

systems
readily
available
today
while
the

will
remain

to
protect
the

we
are
willing

invite
an

to
assure
all

that
there

a
the
national

the

the

and
other

were
involved
in
this

this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the

manufacturer
that
produces
them
q
who
provides
the

a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their

in

california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of

the

today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
a
nice
formulation
for
the
introduction
of
the
first
encryption
devices
with
builtin
trapdoors
just
like
the
feds
wanted
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
blabla
protect
electronic

and
computer
files
while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal

it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
indeed
and
the
current
proposal
does
nothing
to
prevent
the
latter
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
doesnt
say
much
there
are
many
incredibly
weak
encryption
algorithms
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
except
from
the
government
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
nope
the
criminals
wont
be
stupid
enough
to
use
the
new

theyll
use
something

this
technology
provides
only
means
to
intercept
the

of
people
who
are

enough
to
use

agencies

the

general
access

will
be

with

that
is
the

has
the

it
doesnt

much
if

it
cannot
be

some
people
do
not
trust
des
even
today
after
all
the
examinations
only
because
some
parts
of
its
design
were
kept
secret
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and

we
need
the
clipper

and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal

in
order
to
assess

so
theyll
use
a
different
technology
to
hide
their
illegal

so
will
those
lawabiding
citizens
who
do
not
trust
their
government
not
to
misuse
its
abilities
to
decrypt

the
privacy
of
our

including
the
need
to
employ

encryption
for

the

can

it
cannot
protect

from

protect

from

the

whether

illegal
the

is
not

since

threatens
the

such

with

the
clear
middle
ground
implied
by

is
to
say
that
americans
have
the
right
to
clipper

but
not
to

this
implies
that
ultimately
nonclipper

announced
a
new

in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of

while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of

the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new

to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against

the
rights
of

against
law

can
help

the
unauthorized

it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge

encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of

we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to

they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the

the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive

that
accommodates
the

of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ

for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized

to
access

today
while
the

have
ongoing

i
buy
one
of

a
we
expect
several

to
consider
incorporating

q
if

over
law
enforcement
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
warrant
the
encryption
scheme
used
is
to
be
classified
but
the
chips
will
be
available
to
any
manufacturer
for
incorporation
into
its
communications
products
this
proposal
raises
a
number
of
serious
concerns
first
the
administration
has
adopted
a
solution
before
conducting
an
inquiry
the
nsadeveloped
clipper
chip
may
not
be
the
most
secure
product
other
vendors
or
developers
may
have
better
schemes
furthermore
we
should
not
rely
on
the
government
as
the
sole
source
for
the
clipper
or
any
other
chips
rather
independent
chip
manufacturers
should
be
able
to
produce
chipsets
based
on
open
standards
second
an
algorithm
cannot
be
trusted
unless
it
can
be
tested
yet
the
administration
proposes
to
keep
the
chip
algorithm
classified
eff
believes
that
any
standard
adopted
ought
to
be
public
and
open
the
public
will
only
have
confidence
in
the
security
of
a
standard
that
is
open
to
independent
expert
scrutiny
third
while
the
use
of
the
use
of
a
splitkey
dual
escrowed
system
may
prove
to
be
a
reasonable
balance
between
privacy
and
law
enforcement
needs
the
details
of
this
scheme
must
be
explored
publicly
before
it
is
adopted
what
will
give
people
confidence
in
the
safety
of
their
keys
does
disclosure
of
keys
to
a
third
party
waive
an
individuals
fifth
amendment
rights
in
subsequent
criminal
inquiries
these
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
questions
the
administrations
proposal
raised
but
fails
to
answer
in
sum
the
administration
has
shown
great
sensitivity
to
the
importance
of
these
issues
by
planning
a
comprehensive
inquiry
into
digital
privacy
and
security
however
the
clipper
chip
solution
ought
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
inquiry
and
not
be
adopted
before
the
discussion
even
begins
details
of
the
proposal
escrow
the
key
will
be
divided
between
two
escrow
agents
each
of
whom
hold
of
each
key
the
manufacturer
of
the
communications
device
would
be
required
to
register
all
keys
with
the
two
independent
escrow
agents
a
key
is
tied
to
the
device
however
not
the
person
using
it
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
court
order
the
two
escrow
agents
would
have
to
turn
the
key
parts
over
to
law
enforcement
agents
according
to
the
presidential
directive
just
issued
the
attorney
general
will
be
asked
to
identify
appropriate
escrow
agents
some
in
the
administration
have
suggested
that
one
nonlaw

federal
agency
perhaps
the
federal
reserve
and
one
nongovernmental
organization
could
be
chosen
but
there
is
no
agreement
on

the

that

by
which
the

or
others
could
break
the
code
without
securing
keys
from
the
escrow

and
that
the
president
will
be
told
there
are
no
back

to

while
at

protecting

as
encryption
technology
improves
doing

the

government
has
developed
a

that
not

provides
privacy
through

that
is
substantially
more
robust
than
the
current
government
standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the
keys
needed
to
unlock
the
encryption
the
system
for
the
escrowing
of

will
allow

carl
april
initial
eff
analysis
of
clinton
privacy
and
security
proposal
the
clinton
administration
today
made
a
major
announcement
on
cryptography
policy
which
will
effect
the
privacy
and
security
of
millions
of
americans
the
first
part
of
the
plan
is
to
begin
a
comprehensive
inquiry
into
major
communications
privacy
issues
such
as
export
controls
which
have
effectively
denied
most
people
easy
access
to
robust
encryption
as
well
as
law
enforcement
issues
posed
by
new
technology
however
eff
is
very
concerned
that
the
administration
has
already
reached
a
conclusion
on
one
critical
part
of
the
inquiry
before
any
public
comment
or
discussion
has
been
allowed
apparently
the
administration
is
going
to
use
its
leverage
to
get
all
telephone
equipment
vendors
to
adopt
a
voice
encryption
standard
developed
by
the
national
security
agency
the
socalled
clipper
chip
is
an
split
key
escrowed
encryption
scheme
which
will
be
built
into
chips
manufactured
by
a
military
contractor
two
separate
escrow
agents
would
store
users
keys
and
be
required
to
turn
them
over
law
enforcement
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
warrant
the
encryption
scheme
used
is
to
be
classified
but
they
chips
will
be
available
to
any
manufacturer
for
incorporation
into
their
communications
products
this
proposal
raises
a
number
of
serious
concerns
first
the
administration
appears
to
be
adopting
a
solution
before
conducting
an
inquiry
the
nsadeveloped
clipper
chip
may
not
be
the
most
secure
product
other
vendors
or
developers
may
have
better
schemes
furthermore
we
should
not
rely
on
the
government
as
the
sole
source
for
clipper
or
any
other
chips
rather
independent
chip
manufacturers
should
be
able
to
produce
chipsets
based
on
open
standards
second
an
algorithm
can
not
be
trusted
unless
it
can
be
tested
yet
the
administration
proposes
to
keep
the
chip
algorithm
classified
eff
believes
that
any
standard
adopted
ought
to
be
public
and
open
the
public
will
only
have
confidence
in
the
security
of
a
standard
that
is
open
to
independent
expert
scrutiny
third
while
the
use
of
the
splitkey
dualescrowed
system
may
prove
to
be
a
reasonable
balance
between
privacy
and
law
enforcement
needs
the
details
of
this
scheme
must
be
explored
publicly
before
it
is
adopted
what
will
give
people
confidence
in
the
safety
of
their
keys
does
disclosure
of
keys
to
a
third
party
waive
individuals
fifth
amendment
rights
in
subsequent
criminal
inquiries
in
sum
the
administration
has
shown
great
sensitivity
to
the
importance
of
these
issues
by
planning
a
comprehensive
inquiry
into
digital
privacy
and
security
however
the
clipper
chip
solution
ought
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
inquiry
not
be
adopted
before
the
discussion
even
begins
details
of
the
proposal
escrow
the
key
will
be
divided
between
two
escrow
agents
each
of
whom
hold
bits
of
each
key
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
warrant
the
two
escrow
agents
would
have
to
turn
the
key
parts
over
to
law
enforcement
agents
most
likely
the
attorney
general
will
be
asked
to
identify
appropriate
escrow
agents
some
in
the
administration
have
suggested
one
nonlaw
enforcement
federal
agency
perhaps
the
federal
reserve
and
one
nongovernmental
organization
but
there
is
no
agreement
on
the
identity
of
the
agents
yet
key
registration
would
be
done
by
the
manufacturer
of

though
some
may
argue
about
the

of

its
worth
noting
that
the
government
proposal
is
limited
to
scrambled
telephony
if
it
is
only
used
for
that
purpose
and
does
not
extend
to
electronic

or

encryption
then
it
is
an
improvement
over
the
current

which
with

is

end
with

discusions
about

for

and

lets
focus
on
this
one
question
that
was
not
asked
in
the
release
is
whether
this
proposal
is
limited
to
telephony
or
if
the
government
intends
to
expand
it
though
i
share
many
of
the
concerns
expressed
by
some
i
find
the
proposal
less
threatening
than
many
others
since
right
now
most
americans
have
no
secure
telephony
and
any
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
leads
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
this
would
also
plug
up
the
security
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phones
reading
between
the
lines
i
infer
that
the
system
is
highly
secure
without
access
to
the
keys
this
would
meet
the
needs
of
us
businesses
confronted
by
rich
and
powerful
adversaries
including
french
and
japanese
security
services
and
rich
japanese
companies
it
allows
the
nsa
to
make
available
some
of
its
better
stuff
while
protecting
law
enforcement
needs
most
legitimate
us
corporations
trust
the
nsa
and
would
be
delighted
to
have
a
highsecurity
system
certified
by
them
even
at
the
price
of
depositing
keys
in
escrow
i
see
no
difficulty
in
creating
a
reliable
escrow
corporations
entrust
their
secrets
to
attorneys
every
day
of
the
week
and
that
system
has
worked
pretty
well
from
my
point
of
view
this
is
a
fair
starting
point
there
are
concerns
that
need
to
be
addressed
including
the
reliability
of
the
escrows
but
in
return
we
get
access
to
highsecurity
crypto
many
have
suggested
that
des
and
other
systems
may
be
breakable
by
the
nsa
and
hence
others
similarly
skilled
and
endowed
there
is
at
least
a
good
possibility
which
should
be
checked
that
the
proposed
system
is
not
so
breakable
it
doesnt
have
to
be
nor
does
it
have
to
have
trapdoors
if
the
government
can
get
the
keys
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
court
order
thus
they
can
protect
legitimate

against
economic
adversaries

compromising

the

key
registration
idea
okay
lets
suppose
that
the
nsanistmykotronix
registered
key
system
becomes
standard
and
im
able
to
buy
such
a
system
from
my
local
radio
shack
every
phone
comes
with
a
built
in
chip
and
the
government
has
the
key
to
every
phone
call
i
go
and
buy
a
phone
and
dutifully
register
the
key
whats
to
prevent
me
from
swapping
phones
with
a
friend
or
buying
a
used
phone
at
a
garage
sale
whooa
the
secret
registered
keys
just
became
unsynchronized
when
the
government
comes
to
listen
in
they
only
receive
gobbledlygook
because
the
secret
key
registered
under
my
name
isnt
the
right
one
that
leads
me
to
conjecture
that
the
system
isnt
that
secure
there
are
just
two
master
keys
that
work
for
all
the
phones
in
the
country
the
part
about
registering
your
keys
is
just
bogus
or
the
system
is
vulnerable
to
simple
phone
swapping
attacks
like
this
criminals
will
quickly
figure
this
out

go

by

secretary
the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as
policy
options
are
developed
the
administration
is
committed
to
working
with
the
private
sector
to
spur
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
which
will
use
new

give
americans
unprecedented

superhighways
will
transmit

will
play
an
increasingly

role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal

like

would
the

be
willing
to
use

more

encryption

a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other

that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility

how
does

to

for
will
owners
be

to
register
their

faxes
modems
etc
and
inform
the

when
they
are
moved
to
a

will
there

if
the

does
not
do
this
will
identification
the
national
health
care
id
perhaps
be
required
when
purchasing
a
clipperequipted
phone
or
will
each
chip
transmit
identifying
information
at
the
start
of
a
conversation
identification
which
could
be
used
to
automatically
log
who
calls
whom
the
phone
company
keeps
records
but
this
information
would
be
accessable
by
a
wellplaced
van
near
a
microwave
relay
station
this
raises
the
question
of
how
the
two
phones
agree
on
a
communications
encryption
key
will
it
be
something
that
is
derived
from
information
exchanged
at

the
stragegy
of
the
government
is
interesting
the
real
fear
comes
from
them
doing
more
than
this
this
is
a
voluntary
program
and
thus
harder
for
us
to
object
to
on
the
surface
their
strategy
is
a
business
one
rather
than
legal
one
they
are
pushing
to
get
a
standard
in
place
a
secret
standard
and
if
they
get
it
as
a
standard
then
they
will
drive
competitors
out
of
the
market
it
will
be
legal
to
sell
better
untapable
encryption
that
doesnt
have
registered
keys
but
it
will
be
difficult
and
thus
not
a
plan
for
most
phone
companies
you
see
with
clipper
chip
phones
youll
be
able
to
talk
to
any
cellular
company
or
other
phones
or
ports
because
they
will
follow
the
standard
att
has
already
announced
a
clipper
chip
encryption
product
the
government
has
marketed
hard
to
get
major
vendors
to
use
these
chips
if
they
get
enough
market
share
they
will
rule
and
thus
there
will
be
very
little
market
for
systems
that
cant
be
tapped
by
the
police
the
public
isnt
that
concerned
about
it
now
after
all
they
freely
do
calls
that
anybody
with
an
old
tv
can
listen
to
today
they
wont
pay
big
extra
bucks
for
proprietary
phones
that
secure
them
only
from
the
police
well
some
people
will
buy
these
phones
but
they
will
only
work
with
other
proprietary
phones
so
the
market
will
be
small
and
the
phones
expensive
unless
they
are
made
in
numbers
large
enough
to
sell
them
cheap
only
the
mob
will
buy
them
and
this
means
that
the
fbi
will
want
to
track
the
customer
lists
of
better
encryption
phones
because
the
only
reason
a

would
want

let

i

that
my

to

the

full
uncooperation

such
as

and
i
call
on
everyone
with

the

not

hence
anyone
involved

in
this
respect
is
wholly
negligent

remiss
in
performing

while
encryption
technology
can

and

it

if

so
he
should
find
merit
with
it
nevertheless
cryptography
is
neutral
technology
if
everybody
has
strong
cryptography
including
policemen
bureacrats
businessmen

hoodlums
we

anything
less
is
an
unworkable
antiegaltarian
arrangement
intrinsically
antithetical
to

guaranteed
to
collapse
under
its
own

of
inherent
impracticality
we
dont
need
to
compromise
on
issues
of

for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no

between
our
private

the

community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real

of

for

long
our

has
demonstrated
itself
to
be

hostile

a
serious
obstacle
to
economic

protecting

since

will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop

comprehensive

regarding

use
the

is
committed
to
policies
that
protect
all
americans
right
to

while
also
protecting
them
from
those
who
break
the

it
is
not

and
even
if
by
some
grandiose

such
a
thing
were
possible
it
would
only
be
an
efficient
way
to
deprive
american
citizens
of
fundamental

inalienable

the

has
to
be

alone
esp
on
this
issue
the

no
legitimate

we

assume

scheme
this
doesnt

theres

my

on

the

many

economic
factors

not

the

the

an
enterprising

what

a

cryptosystem
a
privatekey
cryptosystem
consists
of
an
encryption
system
e
and
a
decryption
system
d
the
encryption
system
e
is
a
collection
of
functions
ek
indexed
by
keys
k
mapping
some
set
of
plaintexts
p
to
some
set
of
ciphertexts
c
similarly
the
decryption
system
d
is
a
collection
of
functions
dk
such
that
dkekp
p
for
every
plaintext
p
that
is
succesful
decryption
of
ciphertext
into
plaintext
is
accomplished
using
the
same
key
index
as
was
used
for
the
corresponding
encryption
of
plaintext
into
ciphertext
such
systems
wherein
the
same
key
value
is
used
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
are
also
known
as
symmetric
cryptoystems
what
is
an
attack
in
intuitive
terms
a
passive
attack
on
a
cryptosystem
is
any
method
of
starting
with
some
information
about
plaintexts
and
their
corresponding
ciphertexts
under
some
unknown
key
and
figuring
out
more
information
about
the
plaintexts
its
possible
to
state
mathematically
what
this
means
here
we
go
fix
functions
f
g
and
h
of
n
variables
fix
an
encryption
system
e
and
fix
a
distribution
of
plaintexts
and
keys
an
attack
on
e
using
g
assuming
f
giving
h
with
probability
p
is
an
algorithm
a
with
a
pair
f
g
of
inputs
and
one
output
h
such
that
there
is
probability
p
of
computing
h
if
we
have
f
and
g
note
that
this
probability
depends
on
the
distribution
of
the
vector
the
attack
is
trivial
or
pointless
if
there
is
probability
at
least
p
of
computing
h
if
f
and
g
here
range
uniformly
over
the
possible
ciphertexts
and
have
no
particular
relation
to
in
other
words
an
attack
is
trivial
if
it
doesnt
actually
use
the
encryptions
an
attack
is
called
oneciphertext
if
n
twociphertext
if
n
and
so
on
whats
the
advantage
of
formulating
all
this
mathematically
in
basic
cryptology
you
can
never
prove
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secure
read
part
we
keep
saying
a
strong
cryptosystem
must
have
this
property
but
having
this
property
is
no
guarantee
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
in
contrast
the
purpose
of
mathematical
cryptology
is
to
precisely
formulate
and
if
possible
prove
the
statement
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
we
say
for
example
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secure
against
all
passive
attacks
if
any
nontrivial
attack
against
the
system
as
defined
above
is
too
slow
to
be
practical
if
we
can
prove
this
statement
then
we
have
confidence
that
our
cryptosystem
will
resist
any
passive
cryptanalytic
technique
if
we
can
reduce
this
statement
to
some
wellknown
unsolved
problem
then
we
still
have
confidence
that
the
cryptosystem
isnt
easy
to
break
other
parts
of
cryptology
are
also
amenable
to
mathematical
definition
again
the
point
is
to
explicitly
identify
what
assumptions
were
making
and
prove
that
they
produce
the
desired
results
we
can
figure
out
what
it
means
for
a
particular
cryptosystem
to
be
used
properly
it
just
means
that
the
assumptions
are
valid
the
same
methodology
is
useful
for
cryptanalysis
too
the
cryptanalyst
can
take
advantage
of
incorrect
assumptions
often
he
can
try
to
construct
a
proof
of
security
for
a
system
see
where
the
proof
fails
and
use
these
failures
as
the
starting
points
for
his
analysis
why
is
the
onetime
pad
secure
by
definition
the
onetime
pad
is
a
cryptosystem
where
the
plaintexts
ciphertexts
and
keys
are
all
strings
say
byte
strings
of
some
length
m
and
ekp
is
just
the
sum
lets
say
the
exclusive
or
of
k
and
p
it
is
easy
to
prove
mathematically
that
there
are
no
nontrivial
singleciphertext
attacks
on
the
onetime
pad
assuming
a
uniform
distribution
of
keys
note
that
we
dont
have
to
assume
a
uniform
distribution
of
plaintexts
heres
the
proof
let
a
be
an
attack
ie
an
algorithm
taking
two
inputs
f
g
and
producing
one
output
h
with
some
probability
p
that
h
hp
whenever
f
fp
and
g
gekp
ie
g
gk
p
then
because
the
distribution
of
k
is
uniform
and
independent
of
p
the
distribution
of
k
p
must
also
be
uniform
and
independent
of
p
but
also
the
distribution
of
c
is
uniform
and
independent
of
p
hence
there
is
probability
exactly
p
that
h
hp
whenever
f
fp
and
g
gc
over
all
p
and
c
thus
a
fortiori
a
is
trivial
on
the
other
hand
the
onetime
pad
is
not
secure
if
a
key
k
is
used
for
more
than
one
plaintext
ie
there
are
nontrivial
multipleciphertext
attacks
so
to
be
properly
used
a
key
k
must
be
thrown
away
after
one
encryption
the
key
is
also
called
a
pad
this
explains
the
name
onetime
pad
whats
a
ciphertextonly
attack
in
the
notation
above
a
ciphertextonly
attack
is
one
where
f
is
constant
given
only
some
information
about
n
ciphertexts
the
attack
has
to
have
some
chance
of
producing
some
information
about
the
plaintexts
the
attack
is
trivial
if
it
has
just
as
good
a
chance
of
producing
when
given
for
random
for
example
say
gc
c
and
say
hp
is
the
first
bit
of
p
we
can
easily
write
down
an
attackthe
guessing
attack
which
simply
guesses
that
hp
is
this
attack
is
trivial
because
it
doesnt
use
the
ciphertext
it
has
a
fiftyfifty
chance
of
guessing
correctly
no
matter
what
on
the
other
hand
there
is
an
attack
on
rsa
which
produces
one
bit
of
information
about
p
with
success
using
c
if
it
is
fed
a
random
c
then
the
success
rate
drops
to
so
this
is
a
nontrivial
attack
whats
a
knownplaintext
attack
the
classic
knownplaintext
attack
has
and
depending
only
on
in
other
words
given
two
ciphertexts
and
and
one
decryption
the
knownplaintext
attack
should
produce
information
about
the
other
decryption
note
that
knownplaintext
attacks
are
often
defined
in
the
literature
as
producing
information
about
the
key
but
this
is
pointless
the
cryptanalyst
generally
cares
about
the
key
only
insofar
as
it
lets
him
decrypt
further
messages
whats
a
chosenplaintext
attack
a
chosenplaintext
attack
is
the
first
of
an
increasingly
impractical
series
of
active
attacks
on
a
cryptosystem
attacks
where
the
cryptanalyst
feeds
data
to
the
encryptor
these
attacks
dont
fit
into
our
model
of
passive
attacks
explained
above
anyway
a
chosenplaintext
attack
lets
the
cryptanalyst
choose
a
plaintext
and
look
at
the
corresponding
ciphertext
then
repeat
until
he
has
figured
out
how
to
decrypt
any
message
more
absurd
examples
of
this
sort
of
attack
are
the
chosenkey
attack
and
chosensystem
attack
a
much
more
important
form
of
active
attack
is
a
message
corruption
attack
where
the
attacker
tries
to
change
the
ciphertext
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
a
useful
change
in
the
plaintext
there
are
many
easy
ways
to
throw
kinks
into
all
of
these
attacks
for
instance
automatically
encrypting
any
plaintext
p
as
tekhtrprp
where
t
is
a
timekey
sequence
number
chosen
anew
for
each
message
r
is
a
random
number
and
h
is
a
oneway
hash
function
here
comma
means
concatenation
and
plus
means
exclusiveor
in
mathematical
terms
what
can
you
say
about
bruteforce
attacks
consider
the
following
knownplaintext
attack
we
are
given
some
plaintexts
and
ciphertexts
were
also
given
a
ciphertext
cn
we
run
through
every
key
k
when
we
find
k
such
that
ekpi
ci
for
every
i
n
we
print
dkcn
if
n
is
big
enough
that
only
one
key
works
this
attack
will
succeed
on
valid
inputs
all
the
time
while
it
will
produce
correct
results
only
once
in
a
blue
moon
for
random
inputs
thus
this
is
a
nontrivial
attack
its
only
problem
is
that
it
is
very
slow
if
there
are
many
possible
keys
whats
a
keyguessing
attack
whats
entropy
say
somebody
is
using
the
onetime
padbut
isnt
choosing
keys
randomly
and
uniformly
from
all
mbit
messages
as
he
was
supposed
to
for
our
security
proof
in
fact
say
hes
known
to
prefer
keys
which
are
english
words
then
a
cryptanalyst
can
run
through
all
english
words
as
possible
keys
this
attack
will
often
succeed
and
its
much
faster
than
a
bruteforce
search
of
the
entire
keyspace
we
can
measure
how
bad
a
key
distribution
is
by
calculating
its
entropy
this
number
e
is
the
number
of
real
bits
of
information
of
the
key
a
cryptanalyst
will
typically
happen
across
the
key
within
guesses
e
is
defined
as
the
sum
of
pk

different
key
then
less
than
will
be
equal
assuming
random
bytes
of
key
covering
normal
ascii
text
the
smallest
displacement
which
indicates
an
equal
key
is
the
length
of
the
repeated
key
shift
the
text
by
that
length
and
xor
it
with
itself
this
removes
the
key
and
leaves
you
with
text
xored
with
itself
since
english
has
about
bit
of
real
information
per
byte
streams
of
text
xored
together
has
bits
of
info
per
byte
providing
plenty
of
redundancy
for
choosing
a
unique
decryption
and
in
fact
one
stream
of
text
xored
with
itself
has
just
bit
per
byte
if
the
key
is
short
it
might
be
even
easier
to
treat
this
as
a
standard
polyalphabetic
substitution
all
the
old

to

ripem

how
do
i
use
compression
with
encryption
a
number
of
people
have
proposed
doing
perfect
compression
followed
by
some
simple
encryption
method
eg
xor
with
a
repeated
key
unfortunately
you
can
only
compress
perfectly
if
you
know
the
exact
distribution
of
possible
inputs
for
all
practical
purposes
its
impossible
to
describe
the
typical
english
text
beyond
coarse
characteristics
such
as
singleletter
frequencies
you
can
build
up
more
and
more
sophisticated
models
of
your
inputs
but
if
the
enemy
has
a
slightly
more
accurate
model
hell
be
able
to
find
some
redundancy
in
your
compressed
output
note
that
nearly
all
practical
compression
schemes
unless
they
have
been
designed
with
cryptography
in
mind
produce
output
that
actually
starts
off
with
high
redundancy
for
example
the
output
of
unix
compress
begins
with
a
wellknown
threebyte
magic
number
that
can
serve
as
an
entering
wedge
for
cryptanalysis
this
is
not
to
say
that
compression
before
encryption
is
inherently
a
bad
idea
it
just
has
to
be
done
very
very
carefully
and
by
no
means
removes
the
need
for
strong
encryption
compression
after
encryption
is
silly
is
there
an
unbreakable
cipher
yes
the
onetime
pad
is
unbreakable
see
part
unfortunately
the
onetime
pad
requires
secure
distribution
of
as
much
key
material
as
plaintext
of
course
a
cryptosystem
need
not
be
utterly
unbreakable
to
be
useful
rather
it
needs
to
be
strong
enough
to
resist
attacks
by
likely
enemies
for
whatever
length
of
time
the
data
it
protects
is
expected
to
remain
valid
what
does
random
mean
in
cryptography
cryptographic
applications
demand
much
more
out
of
a
pseudorandom
number
generator
than
most
applications
for
a
source
of
bits
to
be
cryptographically
random
it
must
be
computationally
impossible
to
predict
what
the
nth
random
bit
will
be
given
complete
knowledge
of
the
algorithm
or
hardware
generating
the
stream
and
the
sequence
of
through
bits
for
all
n
up
to
the
lifetime
of
the
source
a
software
generator
also
known
as
pseudorandom
has
the
function
of
expanding
a
truly
random
seed
to
a
longer
string
of
apparently
random
bits
this
seed
must
be
large
enough
not
to
be
guessed
by
the
opponent
ideally
it
should
also
be
truly
random
perhaps
generated
by
a
hardware
random
number
source
those
who
have
sparcstation
workstations
could
for
example
generate
random
numbers
using
the
audio
input
device
as
a
source
of
entropy
by
not
connecting
anything
to
it
for
example
cat
devaudio
compress
foo
gives
a
file
of
high
entropy
not
random
but
with
much
randomness
in
it
one
can
then
encrypt
that
file
using
part
of
itself
as
a
key
for
example
to
convert
that
seed
entropy
into
a
pseudorandom
string
when
looking
for
hardware
devices
to
provide
this
entropy
it
is
important
really
to
measure
the
entropy
rather
than
just
assume
that
because
it
looks
complicated
to
a
human
it
must
be
random
for
example
disk
operation
completion
times
sound
like
they
might
be
unpredictable
to
many
people
but
a
spinning
disk
is
much
like
a
clock
and
its
output
completion
times
are
relatively
low
in
entropy
what
is
the
unicity
point
aka
unicity
distance
see
the
unicity
distance
is
an
approximation
to
that
amount
of
ciphertext
such
that
the
sum
of
the
real
information
entropy
in
the
corresponding
source
text
and
encryption
key
equals
the
number
of
ciphertext
bits
used
ciphertexts
significantly
longer
than
this
can
be
shown
probably
to
have
a
unique
decipherment
this
is
used
to
back
up
a
claim
of
the
validity
of
a
ciphertextonly
cryptanalysis
ciphertexts
significantly
shorter
than
this
are
likely
to
have
multiple
equally
valid
decryptions
and
therefore
to
gain
security
from
the
opponents
difficulty
choosing
the
correct
one
unicity
distance
like
all
statistical
or
informationtheoretic
measures
does
not
make
deterministic
predictions
but
rather
gives
probabilistic
results
namely
the
minimum
amount
of
ciphertext
for
which
it
is
likely
that
there
is
only
a
single
intelligible
plaintext
corresponding
to
the
ciphertext
when
all
possible
keys
are
tried
for
the
decryption
working
cryptologists
dont
normally
deal
with
unicity
distance
as
such
instead
they
directly
determine
the
likelihood
of
events
of
interest
let
the
unicity
distance
of
a
cipher
be
d
characters
if
fewer
than
d
ciphertext
characters
have
been
intercepted
then
there
is
not
enough
information
to
distinguish
the
real
key
from
a
set
of
possible
keys
des
has
a
unicity
distance
of
characters
which
is
less
than
ciphertext
blocks
each
block
corresponds
to
ascii
characters
this
may
seem
alarmingly
low
at
first
but
the
unicity
distance
gives
no
indication
of
the
computational
work
required
to
find
the
key
after
approximately
d
characters
have
been
intercepted
in
fact
actual
cryptanalysis
seldom
proceeds
along
the
lines
used
in
discussing
unicity
distance
like
other
measures
such
as
key
size
unicity
distance
is
something
that
guarantees
insecurity
if
its
too
small
but
doesnt
guarantee
security
if
its
high
few
practical
cryptosystems
are
absolutely
impervious
to
analysis
all
manner
of
characteristics
might
serve
as
entering
wedges
to
crack
some
cipher
messages
however
similar
informationtheoretic
considerations
are
occasionally
useful
for
example
to
determine
a
recommended
key
change
interval
for
a
particular
cryptosystem
cryptanalysts
also
employ
a
variety
of
statistical
and
informationtheoretic
tests
to
help
guide
the
analysis
in
the
most
promising
directions
unfortunately
most
literature
on
the
application
of
information
statistics
to
cryptanalysis
remains
classified
even
the
seminal
work
of
alan
turing
see
for
some
insight
into
the
possibilities
see
and
what
is
key
management
and
why
is
it
important
one
of
the
fundamental
axioms
of
cryptography
is
that
the
enemy
is
in
full
possession
of
the
details
of
the
general
cryptographic
system
and
lacks
only
the
specific
key
data
employed
in
the
encryption
of
course
one
would
assume
that
the
cia
does
not
make
a
habit
of
telling
mossad
about
its
cryptosystems
but
mossad
probably
finds
out
anyway
repeated
use
of
a
finite
amount
of
key
provides
redundancy
that
can
eventually
facilitate
cryptanalytic
progress
thus
especially
in
modern
communication
systems
where
vast
amounts
of
information
are
transferred
both
parties
must
have
not
only
a
sound
cryptosystem
but
also
enough
key
material
to
cover
the
traffic
key
management
refers
to
the
distribution
authentication
and
handling
of
keys
a
publicly
accessible
example
of
modern
key
management
technology
is
the
stu
iii
secure
telephone
unit
which
for
classified
use
employs
individual
coded
crypto
ignition
keys
and
a
central
key
management
center
operated
by
nsa
there
is
a
hierarchy
in
that
certain
ciks
are
used
by
authorized
cryptographic
control
personnel
to
validate
the
issuance
of
individual
traffic
keys
and
to
perform
installationmaintenance
functions
such
as
the
reporting
of
lost
ciks
this
should
give
an
inkling
of
the
extent
of
the
key
management
problem
for
publickey
systems
there
are
several
related
issues
many
having
to
do
with
whom
do
you
trust
can
i
use
pseudorandom
or
chaotic
numbers
as
a
key
stream
chaotic
equations
and
fractals
produce
an
apparent
randomness
from
relatively
compact
generators
perhaps
the
simplest
example
is
a
linear
congruential
sequence
one
of
the
most
popular
types
of
random
number
generators
where
there
is
no
obvious
dependence
between
seeds
and
outputs
unfortunately
the
graph
of
any
such
sequence
will
in
a
high
enough
dimension
show
up
as
a
regular
lattice
mathematically
this
lattice
corresponds
to
structure
which
is
notoriously
easy
for
cryptanalysts
to
exploit
more
complicated
generators
have
more
complicated
structure
which
is
why
they
make
interesting
pictures
but
a
cryptographically
strong
sequence
will
have
no
computable
structure
at
all
see
exercise
and
what
is
the
correct
frequency
list
for
english
letters
there
are
three
answers
to
this
question
each
slightly
deeper
than
the
one
before
you
can
find
the
first
answer
in
various
books
namely
a
frequency
list
computed
directly
from
a
certain
sample
of
english
text
of
course
any
such
list
will
be
correctly
computed
but
exactly
which
list
you
get
depends
on
which
sample
was
taken
the
second
answer
is
that
the
question
doesnt
make
sense
what
do
you
mean
by
english
letters
the
english
language
is
not
a
fixed
finite
closed
object
that
can
be
exactly
characterized
it
has
changed
over
time
it
is
different
between
different
authors
any
particular
message
will
have
different
statistics
from
those
of
the
language
as
a
whole
the
third
answer
is
that
yes
no
particular
message
is
going
to
have
exactly
the
same
characteristics
as
english
in
general
but
for
all
reasonable
statistical
uses
these
slight
discrepancies
wont
matter
in
fact
theres
an
entire
field
called
bayesian
statistics
other
buzzwords
are
maximum
entropy
methods
and
maximum
likelihood
estimation
which
studies
questions
like
whats
the
chance
that
a
text
with
these
letter
frequencies
is
in
english
and
comes
up
with
reasonably
robust
answers
so
make
your
own
list
from
your
own
samples
of
english
text
it
will
be
good
enough
for
practical
work
if
you
use
it
properly
what
is
the
enigma
for
a
project
in
data
security
we
are
looking
for
sources
of
information
about
the
german
enigma
code
and
how
it
was
broken
by
the
british
during
wwii
see
how
do
i
shuffle
cards
card
shuffling
is
a
special
case
of
the
permutation
of
an
array
of
values
using
a
random
or
pseudorandom
function
all
possible
output
permutations
of
this
process
should
be
equally
likely
to
do
this
you
need
a
random
function
modranx
which
will
produce
a
uniformly
distributed
random
integer
in
the
interval
given
that
function
you
can
shuffle
with
the
following
c
code
assuming
arrlth
is
the
length
of
array
arr
and
swap
interchanges
values
at
the
two
addresses
given
for

n
n

modranx
can
not
be
achieved
exactly
with
a
simple
ranno
x
since
rannos
interval
may
not
be
divisible
by
x
although
in
most
cases
the
error
will
be
very
small
to
cover
this
case
one
can
take
rannos
modulus
mod
x
call
that
number
y
and
if
ranno
returns
a
value
less
than
y
go
back
and
get
another

can
i
foil
sw
pirates
by
encrypting
my
cdrom
someone
will
frequently
express
the
desire
to
publish
a
cdrom
with
possibly
multiple
pieces
of
software
perhaps
with
each
encrypted
separately
and
will
want
to
use
different
keys
for
each
user
perhaps
even
good
for
only
a
limited
period
of
time
in
order
to
avoid
piracy
as
far
as
we
know
this
is
impossible
since
there
is
nothing
in
standard
pc
or
workstation
hardware
which
uniquely
identifies
the
user
at
the
keyboard
if
there
were
such
an
identification
then
the
cdrom
could
be
encrypted
with
a
key
based
in
part
on
the
one
sold
to
the
user
and
in
part
on
the
unique
identifier
however
in
this
case
the
cdrom
is
one
of
a
kind
and
that
defeats
the
intended
purpose
if
the
cdrom
is
to
be
encrypted
once
and
then
mass
produced
there
must
be
a
key
or
set
of
keys
for
that
encryption
produced
at
some
stage
in
the
process
that
key
is
useable
with
any
copy
of
the
cdroms
data
the
pirate
needs
only
to
isolate
that
key
and
sell
it

with
the
illegal
copy

what

cryptography
plaintext
ciphertext
encryption
key
the
story
begins
when
julius
caesar
sent
messages
to
his
trusted
acquaintances
he
didnt
trust
the
messengers
so
he
replaced
every
a
by
a
c
every
b
by
a
d
and
so
on
through
the
alphabet
only
someone
who
knew
the
shift
by
rule
could
decipher
his
messages
a
cryptosystem
or
cipher
system
is
a
method
of
disguising
messages
so
that
only
certain
people
can
see
through
the
disguise
cryptography
is
the
art
of
creating
and
using
cryptosystems
cryptanalysis
is
the
art
of
breaking
cryptosystemsseeing
through
the
disguise
even
when
youre
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
cryptology
is
the
study
of
both
cryptography
and
cryptanalysis
the
original
message
is
called
a
plaintext
the
disguised
message
is
called
a
ciphertext
encryption
means
any
procedure
to
convert
plaintext
into
ciphertext
decryption
means
any
procedure
to
convert
ciphertext
into
plaintext
a
cryptosystem
is
usually
a
whole
collection
of
algorithms
the
algorithms
are
labelled
the
labels
are
called
keys
for
instance
caesar
probably
used
shift
by
n
encryption
for
several
different
values
of
n
its
natural
to
say
that
n
is
the
key
here
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
see
through
the
disguise
are
called
recipients
other
people
are
enemies
opponents
interlopers
eavesdroppers
or
third
parties
what
references
can
i
start
with
to
learn
cryptology
for
an
introduction
to
technical
matter
the
survey
articles
given
in
part
are
the
best
place
to
begin
as
they
are
in
general
concise
authored
by
competent
people
and
well
written
however
these
articles
are
mostly
concerned
with
cryptology
as
it
has
developed
in
the
last
years
or
so
and
are
more
abstract
and
mathematical
than
historical
the
codebreakers
by
kahn
is
encyclopedic
in
its
history
and
technical
detail
of
cryptology
up
to
the
introductory
cryptanalysis
can
be
learned
from
gaines
or
sinkov
this
is
recommended
especially
for
people
who
want
to
devise
their
own
encryption
algorithms
since
it
is
a
common
mistake
to
try
to
make
a
system
before
knowing
how
to
break
one
the
selection
of
an
algorithm
for
the
des
drew
the
attention
of
many
public
researchers
to
problems
in
cryptology
consequently
several
textbooks
and
books
to
serve
as
texts
have
appeared
the
book
of
denning
gives
a
good
introduction
to
a
broad
range
of
security
including
encryption
algorithms
database
security
access
control
and
formal
models
of
security
similar
comments
apply
to
the
books
of
price
davies
and
pfleeger
the
books
of
konheim
and
meyer
matyas
are
quite
technical
books
both
konheim
and
meyer
were
directly
involved
in
the
development
of
des
and
both
books
give
a
thorough
analysis
of
des
konheims
book
is
quite
mathematical
with
detailed
analyses
of
many
classical
cryptosystems
meyer
and
matyas
concentrate
on
modern
cryptographic
methods
especially
pertaining
to
key
management
and
the
integration
of
security
facilities
into
computer
systems
and
networks
the
books
of
rueppel
and
koblitz
concentrate
on
the
application
of
number
theory
and
algebra
to
cryptography
how
does
one
go
about
cryptanalysis
classical
cryptanalysis
involves
an
interesting
combination
of
analytical
reasoning
application
of
mathematical
tools
pattern
finding
patience
determination
and
luck
the
best
available
textbooks
on
the
subject
are
the
military
cryptanalytics
series
it
is
clear
that
proficiency
in
cryptanalysis
is
for
the
most
part
gained
through
the
attempted
solution
of
given
systems
such
experience
is
considered
so
valuable
that
some
of
the
cryptanalyses
performed
during
wwii
by
the
allies
are
still
classified
modern
publickey
cryptanalysis
may
consist
of
factoring
an
integer
or
taking
a
discrete
logarithm
these
are
not
the
traditional
fare
of
the
cryptanalyst
computational
number
theorists
are
some
of
the
most
successful
cryptanalysts
against
public
key
systems
what
is
a
bruteforce
search
and
what
is
its
cryptographic
relevance
in
a
nutshell
if
fx
y
and
you
know
y
and
can
compute
f
you
can
find
x
by
trying
every
possible
x
thats
bruteforce
search
example
say
a
cryptanalyst
has
found
a
plaintext
and
a
corresponding
ciphertext
but
doesnt
know
the
key
he
can
simply
try
encrypting
the
plaintext
using
each
possible
key
until
the
ciphertext
matchesor
decrypting
the
ciphertext
to
match
the
plaintext
whichever
is
faster
every
welldesigned
cryptosystem
has
such
a
large
key
space
that
this
bruteforce
search
is
impractical
advances
in
technology
sometimes
change
what
is
considered
practical
for
example
des
which
has
been
in
use
for
over
years
now
has
or
about
possible
keys
a
computation
with
this
many
operations
was
certainly
unlikely
for
most
users
in
the
the
situation
is
very
different
today
given
the
dramatic
decrease
in
cost
per
processor
operation
massively
parallel
machines
threaten
the
security
of
des
against
brute
force
search
some
scenarios
are
described
by
garron
and
outerbridge
one
phase
of
a
more
sophisticated
cryptanalysis
may
involve
a
bruteforce
search
of
some
manageably
small
space
of
possibilities
what
are
some
properties
satisfied
by
every
strong
cryptosystem
the
security
of
a
strong
system
resides
with
the
secrecy
of
the
key
rather
than
with
an
attempt
to
keep
the
algorithm
itself
secret
a
strong
cryptosystem
has
a
large
keyspace
as
mentioned
above
the
unicity
distance
is
a
measure
which
gives
the
minimum
amount
of
ciphertext
that
must
be
intercepted
to
uniquely
identify
the
key
and
if
for
some
key
the
unicity
distance
is
much
longer
than
the
amount
of
ciphertext
you
intend
to
encrypt
under
that
key
the
system
is
probably
strong
a
strong
cryptosystem
will
certainly
produce
ciphertext
which
appears
random
to
all
standard
statistical
tests
see
for
example
a
strong
cryptosystem
will
resist
all
known
previous
attacks
a
system
which
has
never
been
subjected
to
scrutiny
is
suspect
if
a
system
passes
all
the
tests
mentioned
above
is
it
necessarily
strong
certainly
not
many
weak
cryptosystems
looked
good
at
first
however
sometimes
it
is
possible
to
show
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
by
mathematical
proof
if
joe
can
break
this
system
then
he
can
also
solve
the
wellknown
difficult
problem
of
factoring
integers
see
part
failing
that
its
a
crap
shoot
if
a
cryptosystem
is
theoretically
unbreakable
then
is
it
guaranteed
analysisproof
in
practice
cryptanalytic
methods
include
what
is
known
as
practical
cryptanalysis
the
enemy
doesnt
have
to
just
stare
at
your
ciphertext
until
he
figures
out
the
plaintext
for
instance
he
might
assume
cribsstretches
of
probable
plaintext
if
the
crib
is
correct
then
he
might
be
able
to
deduce
the
key
and
then
decipher
the
rest
of
the
message
or
he
might
exploit
isologsthe
same
plaintext
enciphered
in
several
cryptosystems
or
several
keys
thus
he
might
obtain
solutions
even
when
cryptanalytic
theory
says
he
doesnt
have
a
chance
sometimes
cryptosystems
malfunction
or
are
misused
the
onetime
pad
for
example
loses
all
security
if
it
is
used
more
than
once
even
chosenplaintext
attacks
where
the
enemy
somehow
feeds
plaintext
into
the
encryptor
until
he
can
deduce
the
key

been
employed
see
why
are
many
people
still
using
cryptosystems
that
are
relatively
easy
to
break
some
dont
know
any
better
often
amateurs
think
they
can
design
secure
systems

are
not
aware

that

release

your

most

their

will
not

what
this

is
that

they
should

this

about

but
is
it
any
worse
than

it
becomes
much
worse
of
course
if
the

then
uses

this
is
the

it
may
also

if

up

some
ciphertext
from

is
not
adequate
nobody
has
ever
been
impressed
by

gibberish
any

should
be
secure

if
the
opponent
knows
the
full
algorithm
including
how
any
message
key
is
distributed
and
only
the
private
key
is
kept
secret
there
are
some
systematic
and
unsystematic
ways
to
take
reasonably
long
ciphertexts
and
decrypt
them
even
without

of

this
is
a

and

fruitless

a

such
as

ciphers
include
lucifer
des
spnetworks
loki
feal
pes
khufu

the
socalled
feistel
ciphers
are
a
class
of
product
ciphers
which
operate
on
one
half
of
the
ciphertext
at
each
round
and
then
swap
the
ciphertext
halves

what
makes
a
product
cipher
secure
nobody
knows
how
to
prove
mathematically
that
a
product
cipher
is
completely
secure
so
in
practice
one
begins
by
demonstrating
that
the
cipher
looks
highly
random
for
example
the
cipher
must
be
nonlinear
and
it
must
produce
ciphertext
which
functionally
depends
on
every
bit
of
the
plaintext
and
the
key
meyer
has
shown
that
at
least
rounds
of
des
are
required
to
guarantee
such
a
dependence
in
this
sense
a
product
cipher
should
act
as
a
mixing
function
which
combines
the
plaintext
key
and
ciphertext
in
a
complex
nonlinear
fashion
the
fixed
perround
substitutions
of
the
product
cipher
are
referred
to
as
sboxes
for
example
lucifer
has
sboxes
and
des
has
sboxes
the
nonlinearity
of
a
product
cipher
reduces
to
a
careful
design
of
these
sboxes
a
list
of
partial
design
criteria
for
the
sboxes
of
des
which
apply
to
sboxes
in
general
may
be
found
in
brown
and
brickell
et
al
what
are
some
grouptheoretic
properties
of
product
ciphers
let
e
be
a
product
cipher
that
maps
nbit
blocks
to
nbit
blocks
let
ekx
be
the
encryption
of
x
under
key
k
then
for
any
fixed
k
the
map
sending
x
to
ekx
is
a
permutation
of
the
set
of
nbit
blocks
denote
this
permutation
by
pk
the
set
of
all
nbit
permutations
is
called
the
symmetric
group
and
is
written
the
collection
of
all
these
permutations
pk
where
k
ranges
over
all
possible
keys
is
denoted
if
e
were
a
random
mapping
from
plaintexts
to
ciphertexts
then
we
would
expect
to
generate
a
large
subset
of
coppersmith
and
grossman
have
shown
that
a
very
simple
product
cipher
can
generate
the
alternating
group
given
a
sufficient
number
of
rounds
the
alternating
group
is
half
of
the
symmetric
group
it
consists
of
all
even
permutations
ie
all
permutations
which
can
be
written
as
an
even
number
of
swaps
even
and
goldreich
were
able
to
extend
these
results
to
show
that
feistel
ciphers
can
generate
given
a
sufficient
number
of
rounds
the
security
of
multiple
encipherment
also
depends
on
the
grouptheoretic
properties
of
a
cipher
multiple
encipherment
is
an
extension
over
single
encipherment
if
for
keys
there
does
not
exist
a
third
key
such
that
which
indicates
that
encrypting
twice
with
two
independent
keys
is
equal
to
a
single
encryption
under
the
third
key
if
for
every
there
exists
a
such
that
eq
is
true
then
we
say
that
e
is
a
group
this
question
of
whether
des
is
a
group
under
this
definition
was
extensively
studied
by
sherman
kaliski
and
rivest
in
their
paper
they
give
strong
evidence
for
the
hypothesis
that
des
is
not
a
group
in
fact
des
is
not
a
group
what
can
be
proven
about
the
security
of
a
product
cipher
recall
from
above
that
pk
is
a
permutation
produced
by
e
under
some
key
k
the
goal
of
the
designer
of
e
is
to
ensure
that
pk
appears
to
be
a
random
element
of
the
symmetric
group
let
r
be
an
element
of
selected
randomly
we
will
say
that
pk
and
r
are
indistinguishable
if
an
observer
given
pk
and
r
in
some
order
cannot
distinguish
between
these
two
permutations
in
polynomial
time
that
is
with
time
bounded
resources
the
observer
cannot
determine
which
of
the
permutations
is
produced
by
e
the
optimal
decision
is
no
better
than
simply
guessing
luby
and
rackoff
have
shown
that
a
class
of
feistel
ciphers
are
secure
in
this
sense
when
the
round
mapping
is
replaced
by
random
boolean
functions
how
are
block
ciphers
used
to
encrypt
data
longer
than
the
block
size
there
are
four
standard
modes
of
operation
and
numerous
nonstandard

the
modes
of
operation
can
be
used
with
any

can
symmetric

ciphers

did
not
generate

and
to
prove
to
himself
whether
his

was
altered
or
unaltered
since

but
one
cannot
prove
these
things
to
another
without
revealing
the

thereafter

a
product
cipher
that
operates
on
blocks
of
data
using
a
key
it
is
defined
in
fips
which
supersedes
fips
fips
are
federal
information
processing
standards
published
by

des
is
identical
to
the
ansi
standard
data
encryption
algorithm
dea
defined
in

what
is
triple
des
triple
des
is
a
product
cipher
which
like
des
operates
on
data
blocks
there
are
several
forms
each
of
which
uses
the
des
cipher
times
some
forms
use
two
keys
some
use
three
the
des
modes
of
operation
may
also
be
used
with
tripledes
some
people
refer
to
as
tripledes
this
method
is
defined
in
chapter
of
the
ansi
standard
financial
institution
key
management
and
is
intended
for
use
in
encrypting
des
keys
and
ivs
for
automated
key
distribution
its
formal
name
is
encryption
and
decryption
of
a
single
key
by
a
key
pair
but
it
is
referenced
in
other
standards
documents
as
ede
that
standard
says
section
key
encrypting
keys
may
be
a
single
dea
key
or
a
dea
key
pair
key
pairs
shoud
be
used
where
additional
security
is
needed
eg
the
data
protected
by
the
keys
has
a
long
security
life
a
key
pair
shall
not
be
encrypted
or
decrypted
using
a
single
key
others
use
the
term
tripledes
for
or
one
of
us
carl
ellison
keeps
advocating
des
triple
use
in
the
form
tran
tran
compress
x
where
each
des
instance
has
its
own
key
and
iv
for
cbc
mode
and
tran
has
been
posted
on
scicrypt
it
is
a
largeblock
transposition
program
taking
its
key
from
the
data
stream
itself
so
that
it
is
not
an
encryption
program
on
its
own
part
what
is
differential
cryptanalysis
differential
cryptanalysis
is
a
statistical
attack
that
can
be
applied
to
any
iterated
mapping
ie
any
mapping
which
is
based
on
a
repeated
round
function
the
method
was
recently
popularized
by
biham
and
shamir
but
coppersmith
has
remarked
that
the
sboxes
of
des
were
optimized
against
this
attack
some
years
ago
this
method
has
proved
effective
against
several
product
ciphers
notably
feal
differential
cryptanalysis
is
based
on
observing
a
large
number
of
ciphertexts
y
y
whose
corresponding
plaintexts
x
x
satisfy
a
known
difference
d
xx
where
is
componentwise
xor
in
the
basic
bihamshamir
attack
such
plaintext
pairs
are
required
to
determine
the
key
for
des
substantially
fewer
pairs
are
required
if
des
is
truncated
to
or
rounds
in
these
cases
the
actual
key
can
be
recovered
in
a
matter
of
minutes
using
a
few
thousand
pairs
for
full
des
this
attack
is
impractical
because
it
requires
so
many
known
plaintexts
the
work
of
biham
and
shamir
on
des
revealed
several
startling
observations
on
the
algorithm
most
importantly
if
the
key
schedule
was
removed
from
des
and
a
key
was
used
the
key
could
be
recovered
in
less
than
steps
thus
independent
subkeys
do
not
add
substantial
security
to
des
further
the
sboxes
of
des
are
extremely
sensitive
in
that
changing
even
single
entries
in
these
tables
yields
significant
improvement
in
the
differential
attack
adi
shamir
is
quoted
to
say
nytimes
oct
i
would
say
that
contrary
to
what
some
people
believe
there
is
no
evidence
of
tampering
with
the
des
so
that
the
basic
design
was
weakened
how
was
nsa
involved
in
the
design
of
des
according
to
kinnucan
tuchman
a
member
of
the
group
that
developed
des
at
ibm
is
quoted
as
saying
we
developed
the
des
algorithm
entirely
within
ibm
using
ibmers
the
nsa
did
not
dictate
a
single
wire
tuchman
and
meyer
another
developer
of
des
spent
a
year
breaking
ciphers
and
finding
weaknesses
in
lucifer
they
then
spent
two
years
strengthening
lucifer
their
basic
approach
was
to
look
for
strong
substitution
permutation
and
key
scheduling
functions
ibm
has
classified
the
notes
containing
the
selection
criteria
at
the
request
of
the
nsa
the
nsa
told
us
we
had
inadvertently
reinvented
some
of
the
deep
secrets
it
uses
to
make
its
own
algorithms
explains
tuchman
on
the
other
hand
a
document
called

of
the
nsa
in
the
development
of
des
unclassified
summary
of
the
united
states
select
committee
on
intelligence
printed
in
the
ieee
communications
magazine
states
in
the
development
of
des
nsa
convinced
ibm
that
a
reduced
keysize
was
sufficient
indirectly
assisted
in
the
development
of
the
sbox
structures
and
certified
that
the
final
des
algorithm
was
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
free
from
any
statistical
or
mathematical
weakness
clearly
the
key
size
was
reduced
at
the
insistence
of
the
nsa
the
article
further
states
that
the
nsa
did
not
tamper
with
the
algorithm
itself
just
the
parameters
which
in
some
sense
resolves

apparent
conflict

it

but
as
hendrik
w
lenstra

says
exact
definitions
appear
to
be
necessary
only
when
one
wishes
to
prove
that
algorithms
with
certain
properties
do
not
exist
and
theoretical
computer
science
is
notoriously
lacking
in
such
negative
results
how
fast
can
people
factor
numbers
it
depends
on
the
size
of
the
numbers
in
october
arjen
lenstra
and
dan
bernstein
factored
into
primes
using
about
three
weeks
of
maspar
time
the
maspar
is
a
simd
machine
each
processor
can
add
about
integers
per
second
the
algorithm
there
is
called
the
number
field
sieve
it
is
quite
a
bit
faster
for
special
numbers
like
than
for
general
numbers
n
but
it
takes
time
only
about
n
log
n
in
any
case
an
older
and
more
popular
method
for
smaller
numbers
is
the
multiple
polynomial
quadratic
sieve
which
takes
time
n
log
nfaster
than
the
number
field
sieve
for
small
n
but
slower
for
large
n
the
breakeven
point
is
somewhere
between
and
digits
depending
on
the
implementations
factorization
is
a
fastmoving
fieldthe
state
of
the
art
just
a
few
years
ago
was
nowhere
near
as
good
as
it
is
now
if
no
new
methods
are
developed
then
rsa
keys
will
always
be
safe
from
factorization
but
one
cant
predict
the
future
before
the
number
field
sieve
was
found
many
people
conjectured
that
the
quadratic
sieve
was
asymptotically
as
fast
as
any
factoring
method
could
be
what
about
other
publickey
cryptosystems
weve
talked
about
rsa
because
its
well
known
and
easy
to
describe
but
there
are
lots
of
other
publickey
systems
around
many
of
which
are
faster
than
rsa
or
depend
on
problems
more
widely

to
be
difficult

is
snefru
what
is
a
oneway
hash
function
a
typical
oneway
hash
function
takes
a
variablelength
message
and
produces
a
fixedlength
hash
given
the
hash
it
is
computationally
impossible
to
find
a
message
with
that
hash
in
fact
one
cant
determine
any
usable
information
about
a
message
with
that
hash
not
even
a
single
bit
for
some
oneway
hash
functions
its
also
computationally
impossible
to
determine
two
messages
which
produce
the
same
hash
a
oneway
hash
function
can
be
private
or
public
just
like
an
encryption
function
heres
one
application
of
a
public
oneway
hash
function
like
or
snefru
most
publickey
signature
systems
are
relatively
slow
to
sign
a
long
message
may
take
longer
than
the
user
is
willing
to
wait
solution
compute
the
oneway
hash
of
the
message
and
sign
the
hash
which
is
short
now
anyone
who
wants
to
verify
the
signature
can
do
the
same
thing
another
name
for
oneway
hash
function
is
message
digest
function
what
is
the
difference
between
public
private
secret
shared
etc
there
is
a
horrendous
mishmash
of
terminology
in
the
literature
for
a
very
small
set
of
concepts
when
an
algorithm
depends
on
a
key
which
isnt
published
we
call
it
a
private
algorithm
otherwise
we
call
it
a
public
algorithm
we
have
encryption
functions
e
and
decryption
functions
d
so
that
dem
m
for
any

m
we
also
have
hashing
functions
h
and
verification
functions
v

vmx

only
if
x
hm
a
publickey
cryptosystem
has
public
encryption
and
private
decryption
checksums
such
as
the
application
mentioned
in
the
previous
question
have
public
hashing
and
public
verification
digital
signature
functions
have
private
hashing
and
public
verification
only
one
person
can
produce
the
hash
for
a
message
but
everyone
can
verify
that
the
hash
is
correct
obviously
when
an
algorithm
depends
on
a
private
key
its
meant
to
be
unusable
by
anyone
who
doesnt
have
the
key
theres
no
real
difference
between
a
shared
key
and
a
private
key
a
shared
key
isnt
published
so
its
private
if
you
encrypt
data
for
a
friend
rather
than
for
your

only

what
about
the
voynich
manuscript
what
is
the
national
security
agency
nsa
the
nsa
is
the
official
security
body
of
the
us
government
it
was
given
its
charter
by
president
truman
in
the
late
and
has
continued
research
in
cryptology
till
the
present
the
nsa
is
known
to
be
the
largest
employer
of
mathematicians
in
the
world
and
is
also
the
largest
purchaser
of
computer
hardware
in
the
world
governments
in
general
have
always
been
prime
employers
of
cryptologists
the
nsa
probably
possesses
cryptographic
expertise
many
years
ahead
of
the
public
state
of
the
art
and
can
undoubtedly
break
many
of
the
systems
used
in
practice
but
for
reasons
of
national
security
almost
all
information
about
the
nsa
is
classified
bamfords
book
bamfd
gives
a
history
of
the
people
and
operations
of
the
nsa
the
following
quote
from
massey
highlights
the
difference
between
public
and
private
research
in
cryptography
if
one
regards
cryptology
as
the
prerogative
of
government
one
accepts
that
most
cryptologic
research
will
be
conducted
behind
closed
doors
without
doubt
the
number
of
workers
engaged
today
in
such
secret
research
in
cryptology
far
exceeds
that
of
those
engaged
in
open
research
in
cryptology
for
only
about
years
has
there
in
fact
been
widespread
open
research
in
cryptology
there
have
been
and
will
continue
to
be
conflicts
between
these
two
research
communities
open
research
is
common
quest
for
knowledge
that
depends
for
its
vitality
on
the
open
exchange
of
ideas
via
conference
presentations
and
publications
in
scholarly
journals
but
can
a
government
agency
charged
with
responsibilities
of
breaking
the
ciphers
of
other
nations
countenance
the
publication
of
a
cipher
that
it
cannot
break
can
a
researcher
in
good
conscience
publish
such
a
cipher
that
might
undermine
the
effectiveness
of
his
own
governments
codebreakers
one
might
argue
that
publication
of
a
provablysecure
cipher
would
force
all
governments
to
behave
like
stimsons
gentlemen
but
one
must
be
aware
that
open
research
in
cryptography
is
fraught
with
political
and
ethical
considerations
of
a
severity
than
in
most
scientific
fields
the
wonder
is
not
that
some
conflicts
have
occurred
between
government
agencies
and
open
researchers
in
cryptology
but
rather
that
these
conflicts
at
least
those
of
which
we
are
aware
have
been
so
few
and
so
mild
what
are
the
us
export
regulations
in
a
nutshell
there
are
two
government
agencies
which
control
export
of
encryption
software
one
is
the
bureau
of
export
administration
bxa
in
the
department
of
commerce
authorized
by
the
export
administration
regulations
ear
another
is
the
office
of
defense
trade
controls
dtc
in
the
state
department
authorized
by
the
international
traffic
in
arms
regulations
itar
as
a
rule
of
thumb
bxa
which
works
with
cocom
has
less
stringent
requirements
but
dtc
which
takes
orders
from
nsa
wants
to
see
everything
first
and
can
refuse
to
transfer
jurisdiction
to
bxa
the
newsgroup
misclegalcomputing
carries
many
interesting
discussions
on
the
laws
surrounding
cryptographic
export
what
people
think
about
those
laws
and
many
other
complex
issues
which

thanks
for
the
pointer
it
was
good
reading
and
i
liked
the
idea
of
using
several
unrelated

with
a
strong
mixing
function
however
unless
i
missed
something
the
only
source
they
suggested
aside
from

that
seems
available
and
unguessable
by
an
intruder
when
a

freshbooted
is
io
buffers
related
to

traffic
i
believe
my
solution
basically
uses
that
strategy
without
requiring
me
to
reach
into
the
kernel
a
reasonably
source
of
randomness
is
the
output
of
a
cryptographic
hash
function
eg
when
fed
with
a
large
amount
of
moreorless
random
data
for
example
running
on
devmem
is
a
slow
but
random
enough
source
of
random
bits
there
are
bound
to
be
bits
of
entropy
in
the
tens
or
hundreds
of
megabytes
of
data
in
a
modern
workstations
memory
as
a
fair
amount
of
them
are
system
timers
io
buffers
etc
i
heard
about
this
solution
and
it
sounded
good
then
i
heard
that
folks
were
experiencing
times
of
seconds
to
run
this
on
reasonablyconfigured
workstations
im
not
willing
to
add
that
much
delay
to
someones
login
process
my
approach
etherfindcompress
skip
takes
a
second
or
two

im
considering
writing
the
beall
and
endall
of
solutions
that
launches
the

simultaneously
tries
to
suck
bits
off
the
net
and
if
the
net
should
be
sitting
so
idle
that
it
cant
get
after
compression
before
finishes
use
the
this
way
i
could
have
guaranteed
good
bits
and
a
deterministic
upper
bound
on

time
and
still
have

the

you

today

even

the

me
that
if
they
get
a
wiretap
order
on
you
and
the
escrow
houses
release
your
code
to
the
cops
your
code
is
now
no
longer
secure
its
in
the
hands
of
cops
and
while
i
am
sure
most
of
the
time
they
are
good
their
security
will
not
be
as
good
as
the
escrow
houses
what
this
effectively
means
is
that
if
they
perform
a
wiretap
on
you
at
the
end
of
the
wiretap
they
should
be
obligated
to
inform
you
that
a
tap
was
performed
and
replace
for
free
the
clipper
chip
in
your
cellular
phone
so
that
it
is
once
again
a
code
known
only
to
the
escrow
houses
getting
the
court
order
to
reveal
the
key
also
makes
decipherable
all
past
conversations
which
may
be
on
tape
or
disk
or
whatver
as
i
understand
the
proposal
i
could
be
wrong
but
ive
seen
no
mention
of
session
keys
being
the
escrowed
entities
as
the
eff
noted
this
raises
further
issues
about
the
fruits
of
one
bust
leading
to
incrimination
in
other
areas
but
is
it
any
worse
than
the
current
unsecure
system
it
becomes
much
worse
of
course
if
the
government
then
uses
this
clinton
clipper
to
argue
for
restrictions
on
unapproved
encryption
this
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
us
i
think
the
camels
nose
in
the
tent
etc
and
it
may
also
become
much
worse
if
the
ostensible
security
is
increased
thus
allowing
greater
access
to
central
office
records
by
the
government
the
conversations
being
encrypted
who
will
object
to
letting
the
government
have
access
to
them
perhaps
even
automatically
archiving
large
fractions
this
was
one
of
the
main
objections
to
the
proposal
that
it
would
force
telecom
suppliers
to
provide
easy
access
for
the
government
one
the
government
has
had
access
to
months
or
years
of
your
encrypted
conversations
now
all
it
takes
is
one
misstep
one

that
gets
them

needed

decrypt

it
gives
us
almost
nothing
of

with

and
the
nice

word

fact
sheet
public

the
first
thing
it
doesnt
say
is
were
giving
you
stronger
encryption
what
it
says
is
the
u
s
government
has
developed
a
microcircuit
that
not
only
provides
privacy
through
encryption
that
is
substantially
more
robust
than
the
current
government
standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the
keys
needed
to
unlock
the
encryption
the
system
for
the
escrowing
of
keys
will
allow
the
government
to
gain
access
to
encrypted
information
only
with
appropriate
legal
authorization
but
des
is
strong
enough
that
only
the
government
can
break
it
now
so
the
major
effect
is
to
make
it
easier
for
government
to
break
at
best
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
nsa
to
break
since
they
need
to
get
one
of
the
two
escrowed
keys
to
do
a
bruteforce
search
for
the
other
key
similarly
it
didnt
say
were
making
encryption
is
commercially
available
because
encryption
is
already
commercially

including

the
nsa
may
not
be
able

break
like
tripledes
or
idea
and
phone
companies
could
offer
desbased
systems
now
if
they
were
convinced
the
government
would
let
them
and
they
could
make
enough
money
the
next
thing
it
didnt
say
is
were
making
encryption
legal
because
of
course
encryption
has
always
been
legal
and
the
president
cant
change
the
first
amendment
merely
by

what
it
did
say
was
in
making
this
decision
i
do
not

prevent

from

which
clearly
means
were

unless

get

once
business
buys
into
this
another
thing
it
didnt
say
is
were
going
to
ask
congress
for
money
to
do
lots
more
wiretapping
because
of
course
theres
a
budget
crisis
and
congress
might
debate

not

what
it

interestingly
enough
in

we
may
want
to
use
some
rather
unusual
technology
such
as
sealed

or
destructive
read
memory
rather
than
typical
computer
databases
which
is
fun
for
a

the
greatest
danger
of
the

if

be
the
chance
that
a

somehow
leak
out
you
can

with

a

storing

something

its

i
think
the
consequences

are
worse
than

the

decide

theyre

the

doesnt

theyll
just

this
is
pretty
clearly
an
effort
by
the

to
do
exactly
what

theyre
doing
as
is
typical

its
mismanaged

agrep
agrep
is
a
very
fast
fuzzy
search
tool
with
a
tremendous
number
of
powerful
search
options
the
one
most
obviously
applicable
to
cryptography
key
selection
is
to
be
able
to
specify
the
similarity
of
matches
in
the
data
for
example
say
you
make
up
a
passwordphrase
of
of
course
you
rightly
suspect
that
this
key
itself
is
not
in
any
dictionary
or
word
list
but
how
close
is
it
to
en
entry
that
could
be
varied
by
some
crack
program
to
bruteforce
search
for
it
you
use
agrep
to
find
out
looking
with
argument
for
none
one
or
two
errors
no
matches
good
so
far
but
agrep
bigwordandphraselist
finds
that
the
pattern
is
too
close
to
the
pattern
imsel
part
of
himself
and
a
host
of
others
to
be
of
any
cryptographic
value
as

an

of

two
corresponds
to
a
simple
transposition
of

like
teh
for

would
have

sf
book
neuromancer
in

even
with

specification
as

will
find
all
those
people
who
think
the
title
was
necromancer
or
other
common
typos
why
miss
anything
also
the

can
look

to
look

your

or
religious
words
etc
in
the

or

you
can
even
search
for

by
using

random
threebyte
combinations
and
eliminate
all
texts
that
dont

you

you

try

p
nsa
to
find
nsa
national

nsecag
no
such
agency
national

nsa
etc
you
can
also
specify
fixed
areas
looking
for
license
plate
when
you
know
that
the
letters
are
correct
you
might
say
agrep
licenseplatedatabase
will
find
all
plates
starting
with
xyz
with
up
to
two
errors
addition
substitution
deletion
in
the
number
area
you
can
also
weight
the
relative
cost
for
substiutions
additions
or
deletion
errors
for
example
when
searching
dna
patterns
for
a
particular
protein
combination
you
might
know
that
some
kinds
of
damage
cause
the
a
nucelotide
to
drop
out
more
than
other
errors
you
could
adjust
for
this
bias
by
setting
dc
where
you
set
the
deletion
cost
to
count
as
c
errors
a
steganographic
use
i
even
used
agrep
stegeograp
e
just
now
to
find
the
correct
spelling
would
be
to
intentionally
introduce
errors
of
a
certain
type
and
magnitude
into
a
plaintext
and
then
later
recover
the
orginal
it
via
an
agrep
pipe
lots
of
possibilities
here
when
only
outlaws
can
have
ciphertext
also
with
agreps
powerful
extraction
options
it
makes
it
easy
to
abstract
the
hits
into
a
useful
form
for
example
agrep

says

the

arguments

ive

different
groups
right
now
im
going

focus
here
on
some
technical
aspects
of
the
plan
hence
my
followup
to
scicrypt
frankly
if
youre
not
an
absolutist
your
feelings
may
turn
on
some
of
these
issues
for
example
with
an
key
simply
splitting
it
into
two
pieces
is
much
less
acceptable
than
other
schemes
because
it
means
that
if
just
one
repository
is
shall
we
say
overly
pliable
a
wouldbe
eavesdropper
would
need
to
recover
just
more
bits
of
key
i
need
not
point
out
in
this
newsgroup
that
thats
pretty
easy
to
do
by
exhaustive
search
a
slightly
more
complex
scheme
xoring
the
key
with
a
random
number
and
then
with
its
complement
would
produce
two
subkeys
neither
of
which
is
useful
alone
that
variant
is
much
more
resistant
to
attack
clearly
one
can
get
even
more
sophisticated
to
protect
the
subkeys
even
more
other
thoughts
some
people
have
noted
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
databases
necessary
but
the
id
strings
the
phones
emit
could
be
their
back
door
key
doubleencrypted
with
the
escrow
repositories
public
keys
for
that
matter
they
could
do
that
only
with
session
keys
and
have
no
back
door
at
all
in
that
case
the
fbi
would
have
to
bring
every
intercept
to
the
repositories
to
be
decrypted
this
would
answer
many
of
the
objections
along
the
lines
of
how
do
you
make
sure
they
stop
we
can
even
combine
that
with
a
variant
of
the
digital
telephony
back
door
have
the
switch
do
the
tap
but
with
a
digitallysigned
record
of
the
time
phone
number
etc
of
the
call
that
provides
proof
to
the
escrow
agents
that
the
tap
was
done
in
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
warrant
i
can
suggest
other
variations
too
suppose
each
clipper
chip
had
public
key
pairs
each
would
be
used
times
after
which
youd
need
more
keying
material
not
a
bad
idea
in
any
event
this
could
be
used
to
enforce
time
limits
or
rather
usage
limits
on
each
warrant
the
keys
the
repository
agents
would
deliver
wouldnt
last
for
very
long
i
suspect
that
the
cryptographic
algorithm
itself
is
secure
apart
from
the
obvious
why
push
a
weak
algorithm
when
youve
already
got
the
back
door
i
think
that
the
government
is
still
genuinely
concerned
about
foreign
espionage
especially
aimed
at
commercial
targets
this
scheme
lets
the
spooks
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too
ive
heard
rumors
over
the
years
that
some
factions
within
nsa
were
unhappy
with
des
because
it
was
too
good
not
that
they
couldnt
crack
it
but
it
was
much
too
expensive
to
do
so
as
easily
as
theyd
want
theyre
keeping
the
details
secret
so
that
others
dont
build
their
own
implementations
without
the
back
door
the
cryptographic
protocol
though
is
another
matter
i
see
no
valid
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
and
as
i
hope
ive
shown
above
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
do
things
that
arent

fact
that
this
just
came
out
now
suggests
one
of
two
things
the
nsa
has
been
working
on
this
for
a
long
time
and
it
only
just
now
happened
to
be
ready
to
release
to
the
world
at
this
time
the
nsa
has
been
working
on
this
for
a
long
time
but
wasnt
able
to
get
the
bush
administration
to
go
along
with
this
plan
i
find
it
unlikely
that
this
would
have
been
because
of
a
sympathy
for
the
unescrowed
use
of
cryptography
more
likely
the
administration
felt
that
even
escrowed
secretalgorithm
and
for
all
we
know
trivially
breakable
cryptography
should
not
be
made
widely
available
thus
said
clippercsrcncslnistgov
clipper
chip
announcement
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
the
majority
of
the
discussion
involving
this
clipper
chip
seems
to
pertain
to
the
encryption
of
telephone
conversations
does
anyone
know
if
that
means
this
chip
is
designed
to
work
primarily
with
analog
signals
the
language
sort
of
suggests
this
but
its
hard
to
say
the
main
thing
i
just
dont
get
is
whether
this
chip
implements
symmetric
or
asymmetric
cryptographic
techniques
anybody
know
im
guessing
symmetric
but
they
dont
get
very
clear
about
it
if
it
is
symmetric
how
is
it
useful
for
anything
other
than
linklevel
encryption
with
an
identical
chip
at
each
end
how
can
you
negotiate
a
persession
key
using
symmetric
cryptography
without
using
a
trusted
third
party
who
knows
your
key
or
does
it
even
use
a
persession
key
if
its
asymmetric
what
about
pkps
patents
which
they
claim
cover
all
methods
of
doing
asymmetric
cryptography
are
they
getting
royalties
or
is
hiding
infringement
the
real
reason
for
keeping
the
algorithm
secret

to
accuse
me
of

they
would
have
to
take
both
keys
out
of

run
them
against
my
ciphertext
and
draw
a
blank
i
was
thinking
about
this
also
its
quite
possible
the
system
transmits
in
clear
the
serial
number
of
the
device
being
used
that
way
they
can
start
a
tap
get
the
serial
number
and
use
the
warrant
for
the
first
tap
to
get
the
key
if
they
tap
someone
whos
apparently
using
encryption
but
dont
find
that
prefix
then
theyll
assume
its
an
unauthorized
encryption
scheme
from
the
limited
details
released
so
far
it
seems
that
the
clipper
chip
system
must
employ
some
sort
of
public
key
cryptography
otherwise
the
key
management
problems
inherent
to
symetric
ciphers
would
make
the
system
unworkable
it
probably
has
some
sort
of
public
key
exchange
that
takes
place
at
the
start
of
each
call
thats
how
they
would
identify
the
private
key
in
their
data
base
this
means
that
either
the
nsa
has
developed
some
non
rsa
public
key
algorythm
or
the
feds
have
decided
to
subsidize
pkp
rsadsi
the
former
is
rather
an
exciting
posibility
since
keeping
the
algorythm
secret
while
making
chip
implimentations
widely
avalibe
will
be
exceptionally
hard
if
the
feds
are
forced
to
make
it
avalible
in
order
to
gain
public
acceptance
than
that
could
break
rsas
stranglehold
on
public
key
crypto
in
the
us
as
for
my
impressions
of
the
whole
scheme
it
seems
that
instead
of
trying
to
ban
strong
crypto
they
are
trying
to
coopt
it
their
contention
that
they
need
to
keep
the
algorythm
secret
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
registration
suggests
possible
inherent
weakness
to
the
algorythm
more
likely
is
that
they
dont
want
anyone
constructing
black
market
devices
which
dont
have
the
keys
registered
anyone
else
notice
that
in
their
qa
session
they
talk
about
releasing
the
keys
only
to
people
with
proper
autiorization
but
carefully
dance
around
stating
that
the
keys
will
simply
have
to
be
supeonaed
they
seem
to
be
trying
to
keep
open
the
posibility
of
obtaining
keys
without
court
order
even
though
tapping
a
phone
line
requires
one
also
pick
up
on
their
implicit
threat
of
eithe
accept
this
or
well
ban

the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as
policy
options
are
developed
the
administration
is
committed
to
working
with
the
private
sector
to
spur
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
which
will
use
new
telecommunications
and
computer
technologies
to
give
americans
unprecedented
access
to
information
this
infrastructure
of
highspeed
networks
information
superhighways
will
transmit
video
images
hdtv
programming
and
huge
data
files
as
easily
as
todays
telephone
system
transmits
voice
since
encryption
technology
will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop
consistent
comprehensive

regarding
its
use
the

encryption
systems
readily

today
while
the

will
remain
classified
to
protect
the

we
are
willing

a
the
national

officials
q
who
was

on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those

we
have
briefed

product
manufacturers
can

i
buy

access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of
these

as
brad
templeton

have
noted
once
the

ensconced
in

there
will
be
enormous
pressure
to
make
it
the

standard
and
it
will
become

standard
as
well
there
is
a

of
confusion
in
the
proposal
about
whether
the
use
of

is
mandated
about
whether
nonescrow
alternatives
will
be
allowed
etc
there
are
also
unclear
issues
about

how

it
will
be
to
make
workalikes
which
meet

sure
the

id

often
criticized
in

for
their

the
usual
complaints
about

costing
too
much
at

so
and
the
general
issue
of
software
patents
we
may
find
that
allying
ourselves
with
rsa
is
the
best
thing
we
can
do
whats
a
mere
licensing
fee
when
our

may
be
at

if
everyone
who

paid

for

expire

sothen
rsa
would
make

im

a
small

to

for
those
to
whom
sounds
like
too
much
im
sure
the
actual
terms
could
be
different
spread
out
over
several
years
whatever
to
me
its
a
small
price
to
pay
strong
crypto
means
strong
privacy
escrowing
keys
sending
copies
of
keys
to
large
databases
and
splitting
keys
into
two
pieces
all
done
with
secret
and
nonanalyzable
protocols
and
algorithms
is
not
strong
crypto
whatever
some
of
us
may
think
about
the
abstract
principles
of
patenting
number
theory
applications
this
minor
issue
pales
in
comparison
with
the
potential
dangers
of
the
clipper
proposal
note
that
i
said
potentialwell
presumably
learn
more
in
the
coming
months
the
rsa
algorithms
are
at

public
have
been
analyzed
and
attacked
for
years
and
source
code
is
available
to
better
ensure
no
deliberate
weakenesses
or
trapdoors
i
know
of
a
number
of
groups
putting
together
voice
encryption
systems
using
offtheshelf
hardware
like
soundblaster
boards
for
the
pc
and
celptype

the
new
generations
of
pcs
using
fast
and
pentiums
are
fast
enough
to
do
realtime
voice
encryption
combined
with
diffiehellman
key
exchange
this
should
provide
an
alternative
to
the
clipper
system
of
course
we
dont
really
know
if
the
administration
proposes
to
outlaw
competing
systems
it
seems
to
me
that
their
goal
of
tapping
terrorists
child
pornographers
and
hilary
bashers
would
be
thwarted
if
lowcost
alternatives
to
clipper
proliferated
not
to
defend
child
pornographers
or
terrorists
but
limiting
basic
freedoms
to
catch
a
few
criminals
is
not
the
american

i

the

justified

and
research
must
understand
that
a
key
step
in
the
development
of
a
new
algorithm
especially
one
destined
for
standardization
is
the
full
disclosure
of
the
algorithm
to
the
private
and
academic
sectors
the
proper
evaluation
of
an
algorithm
dep
ends
on
careful
scrutiny
by
these
sectors
and
only
such
scrutiny
can
provide
true
public
confidence
in
the
security
of
the
algorithm
the
assumption
that
a
new
algorithm
will
be
accepted
based
on
assurances
from
experts
without
full
disclosure
is
plain
ignorance
in
addition
the
assumption
that
an
algorithm
will
be
marketable
over
other
technology
such
as
des
when
it
is
characterized
by
key
escrow
is
lunacy
it
seems
an
easy
step
in
the
logic
chain
that
probable
consumers
will
prefer
to
purchase
equipment
not
crippled
by
government
key
escrow
no
matter
how
tamper
proof
the
key
escrows
might
be
i
cannot
believe
that
even
the
least
educated
policy
maker
would
have
failed
to
realize
these
flaws
i
can
only
assume
then
that
the
drafters
of
the
clipper
chip
proposal
knew
very
well
the
difficulties
of
selling
a
crippled
system
to
the
private
sector
the
only
way
this
proposal
makes
any
sense
or
has
any
chance
of
succeeding
is
in
coercion
even
the
language
of
the
proposal
makes
it
painfully
clear
that
the
next
logical
step
is
the
outlawing
of
other
encryption
devices
and
hardware
that
do
not
uti
lize
the
big
brother
chip
unfortunately
the
public
at
large
is
not
educated
enough
on
the
issue
to
realize
what
they
are
losing
i
expect
the
big
brother
proposal
to
encounter
little
resistance
from
the
american
people
who
you
will
have
so
efficiently
duped
once
again
with
pretty
words
like
harmony
right
to
encryption
and
voluntary
it
mortifies
me
that
the
phrase
that
seems
to
be
used
more
and
more
often
to
characterize
the
clinton
administration
is
i
cant
believe
its
happening
here
more
startling
is
a
question
a
colleague
of
mine
posed
and
the
realization
that
everyday
it
becomes
more
and
more
relevant
when
is
the

mvanheyncsindianaedu
writes
the
main
thing
i
just
dont
get
is
whether
this
chip
implements
symmetric
or
asymmetric
cryptographic
techniques
anybody
know
i
dont
know
but
im
as
willing
to
speculate
as
anyone
several
people
have
suggested
that
the
chips
use
publickey
cryptography
another
possibility
is
to
use
diffiehellman
key
exchange
or
some
other
algorithm
which
has
a
similar
effect
dh
allows
both
ends
to
agree
on
a
session
key
which
they
use
with
symmetric
cryptography
something
like
des
for
the
encryption
how
could
the
back
door
keys
work
in
this
system
i
can
see
a
few
possibilities
one
is
that
the
dhlike
algorithm
has
the
property
that
the
session
key
can
be
deduced
by
an
eavesdropper
who
knows
the
back
door
keys
for
one
or
possibly
both
communicants
perhaps
the
random
numbers
used
in
the
dh
are
seeded
by
the
back
door
key
or
some
such
another
possibility
as
was
suggested
here
earlier
is
that
the
chips
simply
broadcast
the
session
key
encrypted
with
the
chips
own
internal
secret
key
in
this
system
the
back
door
keys
are
secret
keys
usable
for
decrypting
this
session
key
broadcast
actually
the
chips
secret
key
doesnt
need
to
be
a
public
key
in
this
usage
but
can
be
identical
to
the
secret
backdoor
key
this
proposal
seems
most
straightforward
to
me
still
another
possibility
is
that
the
encryption
algorithm
used
for
the
message
itself
has
a
dual
key
property
that
possession
of
either
of
two
keys
can
be
used
to
decrypt
it
one
key
would
be
the
session
key
from
the
dh
exchange
and
the
other
would
be
the
back
door
key
for
the
chip
its
worth
noting
that
one
of
the
proposals
dorothy
denning
raised
during
her
amazingly
prescient
online
discussion
last
november
and
december
was
a
variation
on
diffiehellman
in
which
a
third
party
would
participate
in
deriving
the
session
keys
this
doesnt
quite
fit
into
what
we
know
of
how
clipper
works
but
it
hints
that
those
who
had
early
knowledge
of
clipper
or
whose
thinking
was
somehow
synchronized
with
clipper
designers
may
have
had
diffiehellman
on
their
minds

that
kept

require

and
yes
this
has
to
be
a
public

system
or
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
handle
it
might
not
be

but
that
does
not
mean
that
pkp
doesnt
get

pkp
has
the
patent
on
the
general
concept
of
public
key
encryption
as
well
as
the
particular
implementation
known
as
rsa
hmm
my
first
thought
was
that
theyre
using
diffiehellman
exponential
session
key
exchange
or
an
equivalent
however
the
diffiehellman
patent
like
the
hellmanmerkle
one
on

claims
all
equivalents
so
the
basic
point
stands
interestingly
a

up
in

real

sounded
very

maybe
he

with
you
ask
yourself
this
why
would
any
private
sector
entity
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
was
known
to
be
at
least
partially
compromised
key
escrows
in
this
instance
why
would
any
private
sector
entity
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
had
not
been
properly
evaluated
ie
algorythm
not
publically
released
the
answer
seems
obvious
to
me
they
wouldnt
there
is
other
hardware
out
there
not
compromised
des
as
an
example
triple
des
as
a
better
one
what
follows
is
my
opinion
it
is
not
asserted
to
be
the
truth
so
no
flames
please
it
comes
out
of
a
background
of
years
as
a
senior
corporate
staff
executive
in
two
fortune
companies
id
be
happy
to
use
a
crypto
system
supplied
by
the
nsa
for
business
if
they
told
me
it
was
more
secure
than
des
and
in
particular
resistant
to
attempts
by
japanese
french
and
other
competitive
companies
and
governments
to
break
id
be
happy
to
do
so
even
with
escrowed
keys
provided
i
was
happy
about
the
bona
fides
of
the
escrow
agencies
the
federal
reserve
would
certainly
satisfy
me
as
would
something
set
up
by
one
of
the
big
accounting
firms
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
president
if
they
stated
there
were
no
trap
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committee
of
independent
experts
examined
the
thing
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
reported
back
that
it
was
secure
id
trust
something
from
the
nsa
long
before
id
trust
something
from
some
swiss
or
anybody
japanese
this
may
seem
surprising
to
some
here
but
i
suggest
most
corporations
would
feel
the
same
way
mostmanysome
pick
one
corporations
have
an
attitude
that
the
nsa
is
part
of
our
government
and
we
support
our

q
who

the

a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
congress
so
were
playing
politics
before
we
talk

academia
the

users
ive
heard
of
topdown

but
topdown
democracy
just
whose

are
the
chip
manufacturers
in
q
if
the

were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
bs
about
the
wonderfulness
of
the
key
escrow
system
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
theyll
just
provide
an
easilycompromised
version
to
jq
public
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
maybe
we
need
a
cra
cryptographic
rights
amendment
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques

a

eventually
the

developed
by

national
institute
for

would
be
used
by

the

said
that
to
assure

each

containing
the

would
be
assigned
two
unique

numbers
that
will
be
needed
by

the

lets
ignore
that

the
fundamental

iscan

ignoring

can

stop

if

what

is

gone

how
many
of

will
be
open

furthermore
the

this

acute

if

the

can

stop

the

it

federal

at

i
understand
the

i
could
be
wrong
but
ive
seen
no
mention
of
session
keys
being
the
escrowed
entities
true
in
theory
in
practice
the
technology
of
cellular

will
probably
be
spread
spectrum
and
quite
difficult
to
record
the
crypttext
without
the

if
the

path
depends
on
they
key
as
i
understand
it
to
it
could
be
made
effectively
impossible
to
record
i
am
not
an
expert
in
the
cryptography
science
but
some
basic
things
seem
evident
to
me
things
which
this
clinton
clipper
do
not
address
the
all
pertain
to
opportunites
for
abuse
and
conclusions
based
on
what
i
have
seen
the
membership
of
this
group
except
for
two
notable
persons
agree
to
if
anything
bad
is
possible
by
the
government
in
theory
it
almost
always
ends
up
happening
in
fact
so
the
key
is
to
make
abuse
impossible
question
authority
and
remember
power
does
corrupt
i
think
one
has
to
regard
this
whole
idea
in
the
sense
that
it
will
be
expanded
to
include
other
data
forms
such
as
data
transfer
and
stored
data
and
as
such
should
be
treated
as
if
it
were
expanded
or
such
expansion
will
be
almost
impossible
to
stop
using
clipper
as
a
precident
there
was
a
hint
of
that
in
the
proposal
remember
that
said
please
bear
with
me
i
am
not
very
articulate
so
i
take
more
words
to
say
what
others
could
say
much
more
briefly
thank
you
once
it
hits
land
you
can
record
it
if
you
have
telco
access
the
telco
isnt
supposed
to
give
that
without
a
warrant
thats
the
rule
today
as
i
suggested
this
is
now
the
hint
is
in
the
proposal
that
this
or
similar
proposals
are
being
considered
for
other
forms
of
encryptions
such
as
data
transfer
data
files
and
such
largely
dependent
on
how
this
thing
is
accepted
or
flies
i
think
one
would
be
wise
to
treat
this
in
the
manner
one
would
when
not
if
it
gets
expanded
to
other
areas
than
cellular
phones
i
think
this
is
guaranteed
to
happen
if
this
proposal
gets
by
salami
politics
it
has
been
and
is
used
in
several
other
areas
it
is
certain
to
be
used
here
government
is
not
going
to
easily
give
up
on
the
idea
that
they
should
be
able
to
eavesedrop
whenever
they
want
to
court
order
required
has
proven
to
be
a
rather
flimsy
guarantee
if
the
case
warrants
they
can
always
sieze
the
material
and
force
one
to
give
the
key
or
sit
in
jail
forever
on
periodically
renewed
contempt
charges
so
it
is
not
denying
the
justice
system
the
information
nor
the
ability
to
lock
someone
up
if
guilty
or
refuses
to
divulge
the
means
to
access
the
info
this
is
not
protected
under
the
fifth
one
can
be
forced
to
perform
acts
that
would
result
in
divulging
incriminating
evidence
so
blocking
restrictions
on
private
encryption
is
not
preventing
legitimate
law
enforcement
it
does
make
illegitimate
law
enforcement
a
bunch
more
difficult
especially
fishing
expeditions
without
the
targets
knowlege
dont
give
up
the
right
to
be
safe
from
that
that
should
be
nonnegotiable
and
clinton
and
co
know
it
which
is
probably
why
they
quietly
developed
this
thing
figuring
if
they
get
it
this
far
they
can
ram
it
on
through
how
come
those
consulted
could
be
roughly
described
as
us
insiders
they
cannot
quietely
impliment
it
though
when
they
ban
other
schemes
to
ensure
its
exclusive
use
hence
the
nice
pr
document
to
try
and
reassure
everyone
dont
buy
into
it
has
government
really
earned
that
kind
of
trust
past
or
future
to
be
secure
and
free
one
must
keep
government
honest
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
make
abuse
impossible
not
unlikely
or
difficult
but
even
so
the
evidence
would
not
be
admissible
i
think
unless
the
judge
so
ordered
i
think
that
even
interception
of
the
crypttext
without
a
warrant
would
be
illegal
cops
cant
record
todays
plain
cellular
calls
and
then
ask
a
judge
hey
can
we
have
permission
to
listen
to
those
tapes
can
they
so
what
one
could
use
information
gained
by
reuse
of
the
keys
saved
after
the
last
case
was
finished
or
other
means
master
key
backdoor
easily
broken
algorithm
to
find
other
evidence
which
given
to
a
judge
would
authorize
a
tap
which
wouldnt
have
been
possible
otherwise
this
has
been
the
more
common
manner
of
abuse
of
wiretaps
in
the
past
for
local
cops
this
might
be
workable
to
keep
them
honest
but
the
feds
have
a
workaround
somehow
bet
on
it
does
anyone
really
believe
for
example
that
the
government
will
use
a
scheme
nsa
cannot
listen
in
on
scanning
for
keywords
either
easily
defeated
in
realtime
or
via
a
master
key
i
sure
dont
this
whole
thing
sounds
like
something
to
eliminate
the
need
to
use
oldfashioned
police
work
to
build
a
case
in
the
past
eavesdropping
was
rather
easy
with
or
without
a
court
order
i
think
the
law
enforcement
community
has
become
a
bit
spoiled
and
will
resist
changes
that
require
them
to
revert
to
using
oldfashioned
detective
work
i
just
find
it
somewhat
surprising
coming
from
a
bunch
that
cares
so
much
about
civil
and
individual
rights
that
puts
people
first
the
question
is
put
people
first
to
where
with
the
innards
not
being
revealed
how
is
one
to
be
sure
there
doesnt
exist
a
master
key
for
use
by
nsa
etc
so
they
can
do
their
keyword
scan
etc
on
conversations
they
routinely
monitor
without
a
specific
court
order
remember
the
cellular
phone
limitiation
is
only
temporary
bet
on
it
and
so
far
i
have
not
heard
about
police
telling
people
that
they
have
been
tapped
and
nothing
incriminating
was
found
what
is
to
keep
them
from
simply
keeping
the
keys
on
file
for
next
time
after
awhile
they
would
have
quite
a
collection
kept
especially
for
folks
they
deem
disruptive
and
if
they
get
only
one
key
that
would
reduce
the
search
space
a
lot
unless
it
is
an
rsa
scheme
remember
nixon
years
need
for
court
orders
really
slowed
them
down
didnt
it
and
unless
the
escrow
accounts
are
not
government
controlled
fat
chance
i
see
one
ending
up
being
under
say
treasury
the
other
under
justice
it
could
be
worth
some
serious
bucks
to
some
folks
to
get
keys
to
a
competitors
clinton
clipper
or
descendent
when
this
idea
is
expanded
to
be
used
for
all
nongovernment
encryption
enough
bucks
would
get
one
the
keys
or
the
innards
for
this
algorithm
perhaps
not
an
important
concern
but
given
past
government
behavior
and
the
other
problems
worse
of
course
if
the
government
then
uses
this
clinton
clipper
to
argue
for
restrictions
on
unapproved
encryption
this
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
us
i
think
the
camels
nose
in
the
tent
etc
yes
that
is
a
major
concern
but
i
think
that
they
think
they
can
win
just
by
having
of
the
usa
use
this

they
dont
even
have

thats

they

now
hard

true
what
will
one
do
when
it
is
expanded

storage
encryption
you
can
bet
that
if
clipper
is
accepted
that
will
be
next
on
the
agenda
it
is
even
hinted
at
in
the
proposal
read
it
carefully
expect
the
argumet
well
if
you
got
nothing
to
hide
fine
then
using
that
argument
one
should
not
object
to
video
cameras
being
installed
in

room
of
ones
home
granted
an
exteme
expansion

holds
private
stuff
should

expedition

may
change

safeguards
are

doget
something
dont
work

hard
to
give
up
some
rather
treasured
rights
or
establish
bad
precidents
please
the
price
could
be
hell
to
pay
later
this
scheme
can
succeed
without
laws
forbidding
more
which
people
would
fight
a
lot
harder
they
like
this
enough
that
they
are
dropping
the
so
called
digital
telephony
proposal
according
to
rumours
however
the
meaning
of
that
is
complex
since
they
still
want
to
get
at
the
crypttext
on
telco
systems
and
that
requires
a
bit
of
work
people
would
fight
laws
forbidding
more
now
but
in
say
two
years
because
we
have
this
crisis
situation
which
must
be
addressed
by
some
drastic
action
just
this
added
reasonable
restriction
will
only
bother
those
who
have
someting
to
hide
etc
please
dont
buy
into
it
if
the
clinton
clipper
is
so
very
good
why
not
make
its
algrithm
public
so
many
people
can
exchange
ideas
and
examine
it
rather
than
a
few
isolated
respected
experts
respected
by
whom
for
what
perhaps
a
certain
professor
who
likes
key
banks
would
be
one
of
the
selected
experts
this
does
seem
to
expand
on
some
ideas
the
person
was
advocating
if
i
recall
how
would
anybody
know
that
what
the
experts
examine
is
the
same
as
what
will
end
up
being
used
in
the
clipper
chip
if
it
is
kept
secret
perhaps
the
clipper
will
use
a
crippled
version
with
a
master
key
provision
or
features
not
present
in

subjected

there
and
isnt
it
a
requirement
for
any
decent
encryption
scheme
that
it
not
have
its
effectiveness
reduced
by
having
the
algrorithm
widely
known
i
was
lead
to
believe
that
one
should
assume
the
other
side
has
everything
you
have
except
for
the
keys
i
recall
ideas
presented
to
this
group
are
rejected
if
a
requirement
exists
the
algorithm
be
secret
another
question
since
it
is
a
safe
bet
this
clipper
thing
would
not
be
used
for
government
security
they
are
regarding
it
as
not
real
secure
but
good
enough
for
common
folk
i
think
i
would
like
to
see
a
full
description
not
a
pr
nonstatement
of
just
what
good
enough
means
i
think
when
saying
how
strong
it
is
good
enough
really
means
not
very
the
excuse
that
other
countries
have
these
restrictions
is
not
acceptable
other
countries
do
not
have
our
bill
of
rights
and
constitution
which
the
people
not
the
governments
of
those
other
countries
often
regard
with
envy
what
we
have
as
rights
they
have
as
revokable
privileges
and
if
we
expect
to
retain
those
rights
and
protections
we
must
not
allow
them
to
be
gutted
because
we
just
gotta
have
this
thing
to
fight
crime
we
have
allready
have
our
bill
of
rights
pretty
much
torn
to
shreds
we
should
not
permit
more
weakining
for
yet
another
noble
cause
instead
we
should
be
trying
to
repair
the
damage
our
crime
problem
may
have
a
number
of
causes
but
too
many
rights
and
safeguards
is
not
a
signifigant
one
a
broken
court
system
and
poor
police
work
are
a
much
more
signifigant
cause
as
having
too
many
rights
disregarding
addressing
the
root
causes
for
crime
etc
btw
those
who
suggest
that
this
is
just
an
attack
on
clinton
believe
this
i
would
be
going
ballistic
reagardless
who
seriously
proposed
this
thing
it
is
just
another
step
in
a
gradual
erosion
of
our
rights
under
the
constitution
or
bill
of
rights
the
last
couple
of
decades
have
been
a
nonstop
series
of
endruns
around
the

of
the
constitution
it
has
to
stop
now
is

theyll

note
that

your

i
am
sure
most

their

not

why

there
are
lots

i
worked
in

there
was
a

at

local
radio
shack
and
the
alarm
company
heard
the
cops
responding
to
the
call
over
the
audio
pickup
in
the
store
what
this
effectively
means
is
that
if
they
perform
a
wiretap
on
you
at
the
end
of
the
wiretap
they
should
be
obligated
to
inform
you
that
a
tap
was
performed
and
replace
for

the
clipper

in
your

so
that
it
is
once

a

known

then
you

normally
reveal

are
laid
in

ways
it

be
a
positive
step
if
they
had
to

set

i
assume
at
the
end
of
the

limit
they
should
have

if
we

i

completely
against
anything
that

it
easier
for

spent
a

though
some
may
argue
about
the

its
worth
noting
that
the

is
limited
to
scrambled
telephony
if
it
is
only
used
for
that
purpose
and
does
not
extend
to
electronic

then
it
is
an
improvement
over
the
current

which
with
a
few
exceptions
is

note
that
the
big
issue
for
the

is
the
continued
ability
to
wiretap
before
we
go
off
the
deep
end
with
long
discusions
about

crypto
for
email
and

lets
focus
on
this
one
question
that
was
not
asked
in
the
release
is
whether
this
proposal
is
limited
to
telephony
or
if
the
government
intends
to
expand
it
though
i
share
many
of
the
concerns
expressed
by
some
i
find
the
proposal
less
threatening
than
many
others
since
right
now
most
americans
have
no
secure
telephony
and
any
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
leads
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
this
would
also
plug
up
the
security
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phones
reading
between
the
lines
i
infer
that
the
system
is
highly
secure
without
access
to
the
keys
this
would
meet
the
needs
of
us
businesses
confronted
by
rich
and
powerful
adversaries
including
french
and
japanese
security
services
and
rich
japanese
companies
it
allows
the
nsa
to
make
available
some
of
its
better
stuff
while
protecting
law
enforcement
needs
most
legitimate
us
corporations
trust
the
nsa
and
would
be
delighted
to
have
a
highsecurity
system
certified
by
them
even
at
the
price
of
depositing
keys
in
escrow
i
see
no
difficulty
in
creating
a
reliable
escrow
corporations
entrust
their
secrets
to
attorneys
every
day
of
the
week
and
that
system
has
worked
pretty
well
from
my
point
of
view
this
is
a
fair
starting
point
there
are
concerns
that
need
to
be
addressed
including
the
reliability
of
the
escrows
but
in
return
we
get
access
to
highsecurity
crypto
many
have
suggested
that
des
and
other
systems
may
be
breakable
by
the
nsa
and
hence
others
similarly
skilled
and
endowed
there
is
at
least
a
good
possibility
which
should
be
checked
that
the
proposed
system
is
not
so
breakable
it
doesnt
have
to
be
nor
does
it
have
to
have
trapdoors
if
the
government
can
get
the
keys
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
court
order
thus
they
can
protect
legitimate
communications
against
economic
adversaries

still
being
able

eavesdrop

announcing

several
messges
on

have

and

have

so
here
to
help
out
is
your
friendly
nsa
link
me
i
was
somewhat
surprised
friday
to
get
a
call
from
the
agency
which
supplied
many
of
the
missing
details
i
was
told
the
info
was
public
so
here
it
is
the
cc
of
this
to
dennis
branstad
at
nist
is
mostly
as
a
double
check
on
my
facts
since
i
assume
he
is
aware
of
all
this
please
let
me
know
if
i
have
anything
wrong
the
clipper
chip
will
have
a
secret
crypto
algorithm
embedded
in
silicon
each
chip
will
have
two
secret
keys
one
will
be
the
same
for
all
chips
ie
a
systemwide
key
and
the
other
will
be
unit
specific
i
dont
know
what
nist
and
nsa
will
call
them
but
i
will
call
them
the
system
key
sk
and
unit
key
uk
in
this
message
the
ic
will
be
designed
to
be
extremely
difficult
to
reverse
so
that
the
system
key
can
be
kept
secret
aside
it
is
clear
that
they
also
want
to
keep
the
algorithm
secret
and
in
my
opinion
it
may
be
as
much
for
that
as
this
stated
purpose
the
unit
key
will
be
generated
as
the
xor
of
two
random
numbers
and
which
will
be
kept
by
the
two
escrow
authorities
who
these
escrow
authorities
will
be
is
still
to
be
decided
by
the
attorney
general
but
it
was
stressed
to
me
that
they
will
not
be
nsa
or
law
enforcement
agencies
that
they
must
be
parties
acceptable
to
the
users
of
the
system
as
unbiased
when
a
law
enforcement
agency
gets
a
court
order
they
will
present
it
to
these
two
escrow
authorities
and
receive
and
thereby
allowing
access
to
the
unit
key
uk
in
addition
to
the
system
key
each
user
will
get
to
choose
his
or
her
own
key
and
change
it
as
often
as
desired
call
this
key
plain
old
k
when
a
message
is
to
be
sent
it
will
first
be
encrypted
under
k
then
k
will
be
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
uk
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
added
to
produce
a
three
part
message
which
will
then
be
encrypted
under
the
system
key
sk
producing
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
when
a
court
order
obtains
and
and
thence
k
the
law
enforcement
agency
will
use
sk
to
decrypt
all
information
flowing
on
the
suspected
link
aside
it
is
my
guess
that
they
may
do
this
constantly
on
all
links
with
or
without
a
court
order
since
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
which
links
over
which
a
message
will
flow
this
gives
the
agency
access
to
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
in
the
above
message
they
then
check
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
and
see
if
it
is
on
the
watch
list
for
which
they
have
a
court
order
if
so
they
will
decrypt
ek
uk
to
obtain
k
and
then
decrypt
em
k
to
obtain
m
i
am
still
in
the
process
of
assessing
this
scheme
so
please
do
not
take
the
above
as
any
kind
of
endorsement
of
the
proposed
scheme
all
i
am
trying
to
do
is
help
all
of
us
assess
the
scheme
more
knowledgably
but
i
will
say
that
the
need
for
just
one
court
order
worries
me
i
would
feel
more
comfortable
though
not
necessarily
comfortable
if
two
separate
court
orders
were
needed
one
per
escrow
authority
while
no
explanation
is
needed
the
following
story
adds
some
color
in
researching
some
ideas
that
silvio
micali
and
i
have
been
kicking
around
i
spoke
with
gerald
gunther
the
constitutional
law
expert
here
at
stanford
and
he
related
the
following
story
when
edward
levi
became
pres
fords
attorney
general
right
after
watergate
he
was
visited
by
an
fbi
agent
asking
for
the
wiretap
authorizations
when
levy
asked
for
the
details
so
he
could
review
the
cases
as
required
by
law
the
agent
told
him
that
his
predecessors
just
turned
over
blank
signed
forms
every
time
levi
did
not
comply
and
changed
the
system
but
the
lesson
is
clear
no
single
person
or
authority
should
have
the
power
to
authorize
wiretaps
or
worse
yet
divulging
of
personal
keys
sometimes
he
or
she
will
be

her

the

she
was

it
is
called
only
encrypts
the
serial
number
or
the
serial

and
the
encrypted
unit
key
this
is
not
a
major
difference
but
i
thought
it
should
be
mentioned
and
thank
her
for
bringing
it
to
my
attention
it
makes

it

down

well
first
of

you

they
work

a

of
groups
are
now
working
on
building
software
to
turn
any
pc
into
a
privacy

phone
right
now
and
they
are
all
working
in
overdrive
mode
and
yes
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto
restrictions
lifted
but
this
is
at

an
incrememental
improvement
for
certain
applications
there
are
no
crypto

you
can

you

now
the

is
to
maintain

out
repeatedly
if
you
produce
the
infrastructure
that
would
permit
a
police
state
to
function
all
that
is
required
to
suddenly
find
yourself
living
in
one
is
a
change
of
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
government
our
constitution
was
built
by
men
who
had
to
risk
their
lives
to
ensure
freedom
in
our
country
they
designed
the
system
to
make
it
difficult
for
tyranny
to
arise
for
instance
one
of
the
reasons
the
fourth
amendment
was
put
there
was
to
make
it
harder
for
the
government
to
try
to
make
smuggling
a
crime
think
i
jest
john
hancock
made
all
his
money
smuggling
rum
which
is
after
all
a
drug
think
about
it
the
government
has
everyones
keys
in
escrow
and
the
fbi
gets
their
pet
wiretap
without
leaving
the
office
scheme
there
is
a
coup
which
happens
every
day
all
around
the
world
within
hours
everyone
in
the
country
who
might
oppose
the
tyrants
is
being
monitored
more
closely
than
ever
before
possible
without
the
tools
being
in
place
a
tyranny
cannot
stand
with
tools
like
this
in
place
a
tyrannical
dictatorship
could
actually
be
successfully
imposed
why
give
the
government
tools
with
which
to
enslave
you
maybe
you
can
trust
bill
clinton
but
are
you
willing
to
tell
me
that
you
can
trust
every
government
that
will
ever
arise
in
the
us
hereafter
i
am
not
willing
to
make
that
leap
of
faith
tim
may
whose
sig
block
may
get
him
busted
in
the
new

isnt
this
just
a
little
melodramatic
im
a
political
dissident
as
such
i
am
acutely
aware
of
what
happens
to
political
dissidents
in
most
of
the
world
in
most
of
the
world
i
could
be
killed
for
my
beliefs
call
amnesty
international
some
time
to
find
out
what
happens
to
dissidents
in
most
of
the

all
that
seperates
the
us
from
most
of
those
places
is
a
thin
piece
of
parchment
in
the
national
archives
thats
being
constantly
more
and
more
eroded
by
such
farces
as
the
war
on
drugs
coups
have
happened
in
countries
that
have
had
stable
democracies
for
over
a
hundred
years
governments
throughout
history
have
fallen
no
government
has
lasted
for
more
than
a
few
hundred
years
often
they
are
replaced
by
dictatorships
do
you
really
believe
so
intensely
that
it
could
never
ever
ever
happen
here
that
you
are
willing
to
bet
your
own
life
and
the
lives
of
your
children
and
other
loved
ones
on
it
if
we
construct
the
tools
with
which
tyranny
could
be
enforced
we
make
it
orders
of
magnitude
more
likely
that
it
could
happen
because
if
it
happened
with
the
tools
already
in
place
it
could
actually
stick
naive
fools
such
as
our
leadership
believe
they
can
protect
us
where
hundreds
that
have
gone
before
have
failed
thriving
democracies
led
by
men
far
more
skillfull
than
bill
clinton
have
fallen
to
dictatorship
rome
had
a
thriving

run
by
exquisitely
skilled
men
before
they
became
a

i
for
one
am
unwilling
to
trust
that
it

here
only
hubris
would
allow
us
to
believe
we
are

the

is
this
is
the

thats

the

the

is
whether

anything

theyd

writes
a
remark
i
heard
the
other
day
is
beginning
to
take
on
increasingly
frightening
significance
the
comment
was
made
that
in
other
parts
of
the
world
the
democrats
note
the
big
d
would
be
known
as
socialists
we
might
get
further
if
we
begin
by
accepting
that
the
government
really
couldnt
be
bothered
less
about
the
political
opinions
of
the
right
wing
pro
establishment
types
just
about
the
only
circumstances
in
which
i
could
think
that
they
would
be
interested
in
their
political
views
would
be
to
recruit
them
as
spooks
they
can
be
guaranteed
to
give
the
government
line
when
it
counts
in
us
history
it
has
been
the
socialists
such
as
myself
who
have
been
persecuted
now
before
people
start
asserting
that
there
is
no
mechanism
by
which
the
administration
can
get
their
new
chip
adopted
without
legal
force
lets
try
thinking
in
the
first
place
the
clipper
chip
must
have
existed
for
several
years
as
a
defense
project
therefore
this
is
not
a
party
matter
at
all
george
bush
was
in
any
case
hardly
adverse
to
tapping
calls
he
was
chief
spook
remember
secondly
the
govt
can
quite
easily
apply
pressure
they
simply
ask
their
chums
who
they
give
huge
defense
contracts
to
motorola
etc
to
be
nice
boys
after
all
bill
is
giving
them
a
nice
little
trade
monopoly
since
the
chips
wont
be
avaliable
to
foreign
firms
thirdly
the
people
who
consider
the
democrats
to
be
socialist
are
not
the
same
as
the
ones
who
consider
socialists
to
be
communist
people
might
know
this
if
the
us
education
system
did
not
suffer
from
the
mcarthyite
and
dewy
version
of
political
correctness
the
sort

when

the

the

given
to

will
only
increase
their
numbers
even
if
there
is
some
benefit
to
lawenforcement
through
the
use
of
big

it
must
be
weighed
against
the
constitutional
and
civil
liberties
questions
involved
for
example
in
some
areas
of
the
world
torture
is
used
as
an
investigative
tool
by
the
local
lawenforcement
people
i
suspect
it
is
an
effective
means
of
obtaining
information
and
shortening
many
investigations
it
probably
also
helps
keep
the
conviction
rate
high
the
fact
that
the
torture
tool
is
not
used
in
this
country
even
with
a
court
order
obtained
by
showing
probable
cause
is
because
we
have
rightly
balanced
the
questions
of
expediency
and
what
is
ethically
and
morally
right
i
think
that
the
same
question
of
expediency
versus
morality
should
come
into
play
when
considering
the
use
of
big

i
vote
for
morality
i
am
quite
disturbed
by
what
i
interpret
as
a
veiled
threat
to
prohibit
the
use
of
all
encryption
if
this
big

chip
is
not
put
into
wide
spread
use
after
a
quick
reading
of

i
came
away
with

impression
to
most
of
the
american
public
the

hacker
has
rightly
or
wrongly
come
to
mean

vandal
it
has
struck
me
that
most
of
the

posting

scicrypt
regarding
this
issue
are
intelligent
thoughtful
individuals
who
have
genuine
concerns
about
the
privacy
and
constitutional
issues
surrounding

i
hope
that
the
use
of

does
not
become
mandatory
and

become
illegal

how

how
does

get

does
the

that

that

could
also
i
assume
that
if

has
a

the
only
use
would
be
storing

for

by

question

remember

it
to

the

be
slow

grasp
why
its
a
bad

since
it
seems
so
technical
and
arcane
and
innocent
sounding

not

paranoid

to

would
certainly
be

there
are
also

republican

broad
appeal

that
may
someday
find
themselves
facing

that

more
efficiently
if

play
themselves
out

you

our

you
work

first
enlist
the
aid
of

against

and
then
present
your

management
with
a
united
front
of
engineering
talent
against

write
persuasive
memos
to
your

the

i

no

as
i

ive
shown
above
there
are
a

of
ways
to
do

that
arent
quite

bad
it
just
occurred
to
me
why
the

is
secret
if
it
were
published
one
could
then
build
physically
identical
clone
versions
of
the
chip
that
would
interoperate
with
official
clipper
chips
but
the
cloner
wouldnt
provide
the
keys
to
the
escrow
houses
hmmn
or
is
there
a
technical
hack
that
ive
missed
eg
how
about
if
the
chips
were
made
unprogrammed
but
serialized
and
then
shipped
to
the
two
escrow
houses
who
programmed
in
their
halves
of
the
keys
but
in
a
way
that
requires
that
secret
keys
known
only
to
the
escrow
houses
be
installed
as
well
without
which
clone
versions
wouldnt
interoperate
this
is
getting
awfully

if

comes
out

the

would

satisfy
me
as
would
something
set
up
by
one
of
the
big

i
dont
doubt
that
this
will
be
the
attitude
of
many
corporate
leaders
its
understandablemost
corporate
execs
dont
know
much
about
cryptology
and
its
easy
to
get
taken
in
by
someone
peddling
snake
oil
and
the
proposed
scheme
is
a
major
improvement
in
telephone
security
to
what
exists
now
the
problem
is
that
with
any
security
scheme
of
this
kind
you
have
to
concern
yourself
with
the
weakest
link
in
the
chain
i
suspect
that
nsa
has
put
a
fairly
strong
encryption
algorithm
in
this
wiretap
chip
of
theirs
probably
at
least
as
strong
as
say
des
in
ofbmode
unfortunately
the
existence
of
the
keyregistry
system
seems
to
make
possible
all
kinds
of
possible
attacks
at
a
small
fraction
of
the
expense
of
trying
to
build
say
a
des
keysearch
machine
as
originally
described
it
sounded
like
any
police
court
combination
could
acquire
the
key
for
a
given
chip
i
hope
thats
not
the
case
since
it
would
imply
a
glaring
hole
how
much
does
it
cost
to
find
one
crooked
jodge
and
one
crooked
cop
especially
for
a
foreign
intelligence
agency
or
organized
crime
boss
however
even
if
more
intelligent
schemes
are
used
to
allow
access
to
the
unencrypted
phone
conversations
there
will
be
weak
nesses
they
may
be
very
expensive
and
very
difficult
but
who
would
trust
hisher
confidential
information
to
an
encryption
scheme
that
for
say
could
by
cracked
one
time
in
a
hundred
des
for
all
the
complaints
about
a
key
would
probably
cost
several
million
dollars
to
build
a
keysearch
machine
for
how
many
million

as
i

there
are
a

just

why

one
could
then
build

chips
but
the
cloner
wouldnt
provide
the
keys
to

hmmn
yeah
the
algorithm
is
classified
because
a
military
contract
or
similar
government
equivalent
to
military
has
been
let
for
this
proprietary
design
that
the
feds
say

developed
is
there
a
patent
is
that
patent
publicly
available
my
betting
is
that
that
too
is
classified
if
the

were
made
public

reverseengineered
it
would
compromise
not
only
the
goal
of
justice
of
being

ive

about

there
must

some

what

whats
the

just
ask

its

not

for

used

anyone
anywhere
right
so
probably
there
will
be
some
way
of
getting
these

verified
this
might
be
a
digitally
signed
by
the

copy
of

stored
by
this

it
might
also
be

this
would
introduce
another
weakness

presumably
if

you
cant

how
about
a

you
plug

would
allow
encrypted

communications
with
someone
who
has
a
similar

digitizing

i
dont
know

could
work
in

it
might
heh

i
posted
this
just
before
reading
all

i
guess
they
beat
me
to
it
anyway
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
idea
to
develop
such
a
product
perhaps
in
the
underground
as
it
would
otherwise
probably
become
illegal
pretty
quickly
here
its
really
very
feasible
and
shouldnt
be
too
expensive
all
thats
needed
is
a
box
with
a
phone
jack
on
one
side
a
dsp
in
the
middle
to
do
codec
functions
of
speechcompressed
bytestream
and
an
on
the
other
side
youd
plug
your
phone
into
it
plug
the
into
your
computer
and
have
a
good
old
fashioned
normal
modem
on
your
other
port
the
cpu
in
the
middle
would
do
the
encryption
with
a
version
of
pgp
modified
to
work
on
a
byte
stream
with
or
better
modems
to
carry
the
bytestream
it
should
work
quality
would
only
be
marginally
lower
than
a
normal
telephone
at
the
very
highest
price
you
could
use
one
of
those
voicemail
compatible
modems
to
do
the
digitisation
that
puts
an
upper
bound
of
about
on
the
cost
of
such
a
box
in
practice
you
really
ought
to
be
able
to
get
the
price
well
below
i
could

bought
for

if
i
knew
how
to
write

i
dont
the
reason
it
wont

of

is
that
hardly
anyone
will

will

im

however
we
can

it
might
then
be
trivial
to

perhaps
we
should
start
thinking
now
of
a
standard
to

in

the

even
if

what

when

throws
away

skin
all
the

who
are
reasoning
like
you
will
get
caught
by
surprise
but
it
will
be
too
late
because
then
cryptography
that
is
not
guaranteed
to
be
breakable
by
the

will
already
have
been
outlawed
after
all
youve
already
got
privacy
that
is
said
to
be
breakable
only
by
the
law
enforcement
agencies
so
if
you
are
lawabiding
you
have
no
reasons
to

right
so
if
you
are
using
a
stronger
one
you
have
something
to
hide
from
the
law
enforcement
agencies
right
something
unlawful
right
therefore
strong
crypto
is
a
clear
idndication
that
you
are
doing
something
unlawful
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
president
if
they
stated
there
were
no
trap
considering
the
level
of
competence
in
cryptology
that
you
have
demonstrated
in
your

you
would
trust
just
anything
and
no
this
is
not
an
ad

attack
its
an
attack
against
the
contents
of
your

grin
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committee
of
independent
experts
examined
the
thing
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
reported
back
that
it
was
secure
and
how
do
you
know
that
these
experts
are
not

and
how
do
you
know
that
they

not

how

as

that
will

used
regarding
the

even
the
few
information
they
have

out
has
revealed
a
serious
security
hole
in
the

the

is
split
in

ones
thus
the
whole

is
easily
breakable
if
you

the
swiss

are

more
too
i
see
idea
becoming

popular
this
may
seem
surprising
to
some
here
but
i
suggest
most

would
feel
the

way
mostmanysome
pick
one
corporations
have
an
attitude
that
the

we
support

as

very
famous
ceo
put
it
to
me
one
day
its
not
surprising
at
all
but
not
because
of
the
reason
you
give
its
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
us
government
has
put
a
lot
of
money
behind
this
program
and
it
will
support
it
thus
most
corporations
will
try
to
get
their
piece
from
the
pie
by
supporting
it
too
the
same
good
old
greed
strong
encryption
is
not
widely
available
now
not
because
of

plot
but
because
the

dont
see
much
money
in

it
will
be

even
less
if
the

can
see
any
penalties
associated

if
the

establishes
a
cryptography
standard
that
has
to
be
used
by
everyone
and
everyones
personal
key
is
divided
into
two
segments
and
stored
at
two
separate
albeit
easy
to
find
places
and
that
key
is
only
bits
to
begin
with
we
are
screwed
pardon
the
allusion
to
the
afforementioned
article
the
gov
i
believe
as
do
many
others
probably
already
have
the
cracking
chips
for
this
clipper
chip
made
hell
they
probably
based
the
encoder
on
the
chip
that
cracks
it
that
way
its
easier
to
break
the
code
but
since
it
is
a
classified
algorythm
no
one
knows
that
they
can
crack
it
so
easily
agreed
no
agency
such
as
the
nsa
or
whoever
would
approve
the
public
release
of
a
cryptosystem
if
they
didnt
already
have
the
technical
means
or
the
knowhow
to
decrypt
everything
at
their
whim
surely
the
whole
point
of
all
this
madness
is
to
make
joe
public
think
that
hisher
communications
will
be
kept
safe
while
james
bond
at
the
nsa
can
if
need
be
have
full
decrypted
access
to
someones
communications
thatll
be
quite
a
heist
if
they
can
pull
it
off
i
thought
that
the
us
government
were
going
to
release
the
algorithm
to
a
panel
of
carefully
chosen
experts
who
would
then
study
it
deeply
and
report
their
findings
exactly
who
will
these
people
be
academics
or
governmentsponsored
researchers
tinytoons
i
for
one
and
quite
scared
of
this
kind
of
thing
and
plan
to
support
organizations
and
even
disorganizations
who
are
fighting
against
this
clipper
chip
in
any
way
that
i
can
i
can
only
hope
that
the
same
sort
of
thing
doesnt
start
filtering
over
into
the
ears
of
the

government

if
the

well
we
can
kiss

at

not

david
sternlight
writes
though
some
may
argue
about
the
nose
of
the
camel
its
worth
noting
that
the
government
proposal
is
limited
to
scrambled
telephony
if
it
is
only
used
for
that
purpose
and
does
not
extend
to
electronic
mail
or
file
as
usual
david
sternlight
is
demonstrating
his
inability
to
read
the
proposal
clearly
states
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
it
speaks
about
telecommunications
in
general
read
it
again
david
maybe
youll
understand
it
the
next
time
nah
probably
not
encryption
then
it
is
an
improvement
over
the
current
massproduced
standard
civilian
technology
which
with
a
few
exceptions
is
limited
to
easytobreak
inverters
thats
exactly
what
the
government
wants
all
sheepminded
people
to
think
lets
look
at
the
current
situation
it
allows
to
almost
anybody
to
eavesdrop
almost
everybody
unless
secure
and
i
mean
secure
encryption
is
used
what
will
happen
when
if
ha
optimists
the
new
proposal
gets
accepted
almost
nobody
except
some
will
be
able
to
eavesdrop
everybody
else
but
the
ability
of
these
some
to
eavesdrop
will
be
guaranteed
the
proposal
emphasizes
on
the
former
almost
nobody
which
is
clearly
an
improvement
and
forgets
to
mention
the
drawbacks
of
the
latter
guaranteed
yes
my
statement
assumes
that
the
next
step
will
be
to
make
the
strong
crypto
unlawful
you
think
that
it
will
not
happen
good
luck
note
that
the
big
issue
for
the
feds
is
the
continued
ability
to
wiretap
its
not
just
continued
ability
its
guaranteed
ability
before
we
go
off
the
deep
end
with
long
discusions
about
secure
crypto
for
email
and
files
lets
focus
on
this
yeah
thats
exactly
what
your
government
wants
you
to
think
lets
take
small
steps
one
at
a
time
concentrate
on
the
current
one
dont
think
about
the
future
trust
us
one
question
that
was
not
asked
in
the
release
is
whether
this
proposal
is
limited
to
telephony
or
if
the
government
intends
to
expand
it
its
not
asked
because
the
proposal
clearly
says
that
this
is
the
intention
they
unlike
you
read
what
they
write
though
i
share
many
of
the
concerns
expressed
by
some
i
find
the
proposal
less
threatening
than
many
others
since
right
now
most
americans
have
no
secure
telephony
and
any
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
leads
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
this
would
also
plug
up
the
security
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phones
yes
it
will
it
will
stop
the
jerk
who
is
eavesdropping
now
it
will
allow
only
to
the
government
to
eavesdrop
if
the
scheme
is
secure
of
course
which
is
yet
to
be
proven
but
how
do
you
know
that
the
jerk
you
are
fearing
now
will
not
get
a
government
job
tomorrow
the
new
proposal
guarantees
him
the
ability
to
eavesdrop
then
hell
that
will
even
motivate
him
to
get
that
job
if
he
indeed
is
that
mentally
pervert
reading
between
the
lines
i
infer
that
the
system
is
highly
secure
without
access
to
the
keys
great
the
greatest
cryptographer
of
all
times
david
sternlight
tm
has
succeeded
to
evaluate
the
new
system
in
the
absense
of
any
details
whatsoever
and
has
concluded
that
it
is
highly
secure
i
guess
that
comes
from
the
background
of
working
some
years
for
the
two
major
crypto
evaluating
companies
right
gee
now
the
government
can
save
all
that
money
and
trouble
to
ask
a
secret
council
of
crypto
experts
to
secretly
analyse
the
new
secret
method
for
david
sternlight
has
already
done
all
the
job
for
them
this
would
meet
the
needs
of
us
businesses
confronted
by
rich
and
powerful
adversaries
including
french
and
japanese
security
services
and
rich
japanese
companies
it
allows
the
nsa
to
make
available
some
of
its
better
stuff
while
protecting
law
enforcement
needs
trust
us
were
from
the
government
and
were
here
to
help
you
most
legitimate
us
corporations
trust
the
nsa
and
would
be
delighted
to
have
a
highsecurity
system
certified
by
them
even
at
the
price
of
depositing
keys
in
escrow
i
see
no
difficulty
in
creating
a
reliable
those
who
are
prepared
to
trade
their
liberties
for
the
promises
of
future
safety
do
not
deserve
either
this
or
something
like
that
i
dont
have
the
exact
quote
but
the
meaning
is
the
same
has
been
said
by
one
of
your
great
men
maybe
you
should
study
their
works
more
carefully
if
you
have
the
brains
to
understand
them
of
course
from
my
point
of
view
this
is
a
fair
starting
point
there
are
concerns
that
need
to
be
addressed
including
the
reliability
of
the
escrows
but
in
the
main
question
is
to
guarantee
to
availability
of
really
secure
cryptography
to
the
masses
gee
if
the
proposal
was
saying
we
guarantee
that
every
american
will
still
have
the
full
right
to
use
any
kind
of
encryption
she
would
like
and
regard
this
proposal
as
just
a
default
voluntary
implementation
there
would
have
been
much
less
opposition
for
some
reason
they
didnt
even
try
to
promise
you
that
i
wonder
why
was
orwell
off
only
by
years
return
we
get
access
to
highsecurity
crypto
no
in
return
you
get
crypto
that
is
guaranteed
to
be
crippled
many
have
suggested
that
des
and
other
systems
may
be
breakable
by
the
nsa
and
hence
others
similarly
skilled
and
endowed
while
the
above
is
just
rumors
and
while
even
if
it
is
true
it
is
not
done
easily
the
new
scheme
can
is
guaranteed
to
be
easily
breakable
by
anybody
who
has
the
two
keys
it
might
be
also
breakable
by
somebody
who
does
not
have
them
but
knows
the
right
trick
or
who
has
only
one
of
them
nsa
also
told
you
that
des
is
secure
why
dont
you
simply
trust
them
huh
there
is
at
least
a
good
possibility
which
should
be
checked
that
the
proposed
system
is
not
so
breakable
it
doesnt
have
to
it
is
guaranteed
to
be
easily
breakable
just
get
the
keys
it
might
be
even
easier
but
until
there
is
some
evidence
this
is
just
a
wild
speculation
be
nor
does
it
have
to
have
trapdoors
if
the
government
can
get
the
keys
the
trapdoors
are
there
in
governments
hands
the
keys
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
court
order
thus
they
can
protect
legitimate
communications
against
economic
adversaries
while
still
being
able
to
eavesdrop
on
crooks
pursuant
to
a
court
order
legitimate
and
who
decides
what
communications
are
legitimate
oh
i
guess
its
the
government
right
the
guys
who
already
have
the
keys
its
kinda
if
i
have
the
keys
from
your
car
and
i
am
asked
to
decide
who
has
the
right
to
use
it
legitimately
in
discussing
this
lets
try
to
avoid
the
nastiness
personal
attacks
and
noise
of
some
previous

impossible
since
you
are
demonstrating
the

this

re

to
a

list

folks
i
was
also
briefed
by
the
nsa
and
fbi
so
let
me
add
a
few
comments
to
martys
message
the
clipper
chip
will
have
a
secret
crypto
algorithm
embedded
in
the
algorithm
operates
on
blocks
like
des
and
the
chip
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
uses
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
in
des
in
addition
to
the
system
key
each
user
will
get
to
choose
his
or
her
own
key
and
change
it
as
often
as
desired
call
this
key
plain
old
k
when
a
message
is
to
be
sent
it
will
first
be
k
is
the
session
key
shared
by
the
sender
and
receiver
any
method
eg
public
key
can
be
used
to
establish
the
session
key
in
the
att
telephone
security
devices
which
will
have
the
new
chip
the
key
is
negotiated
using
a
publickey
protocol
encrypted
under
k
then
k
will
be
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
uk
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
added
to
produce
a
three
part
message
which
will
then
be
encrypted
under
the
system
key
sk
producing
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
my
understanding
is
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
will
also
check
it
out
but
this
is
sunday
so
i
did
not
want
to
wait
the
unit
key
will
be
generated
as
the
xor
of
two
random
numbers
and
which
will
be
kept
by
the
two
escrow
the
unit
key
also
called
the
chip
key
is
generated
from
the
serial
number
n
as
follows
let
and
be
bit
blocks
derived
from
n
and
let
and
be
two
seeds
used
as
keys
compute
the
block
note
that
this
is
like
using
the
des
in
triple
encryption
mode
with
two
keys
similarly
compute
blocks
and
starting
with
and
im
unlear
about
whether
the
keys
and
change
the
fact
that
theyre
called
seeds
suggests
they
might
then
and
are
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
form
and
the
next
bits
form
the
remaining
bits
are
discarded
authorities
who
these
escrow
authorities
will
be
is
still
to
be
decided
by
the
attorney
general
but
it
was
stressed
to
me
that
they
will
not
be
nsa
or
law
enforcement
agencies
that
they
must
be
parties
acceptable
to
the
users
of
the
system
as
unbiased
marty
is
right
on
this
and
the
fbi
has
asked
me
for
suggestions
please
pass
them
to
me
along
with
your
reasons
in
addition
to
martys
criteria
i
would
add
that
the
agencies
must
have
an
established
record
of
being
able
to
safeguard
highly
sensitive
information
some
suggestions
ive
received
so
far
include
sri
rand
mitre
the
national
labs
sandia
lanl
los
alamos
treasury
gao
when
a
court
order
obtains
and
and
thence
k
the
law
enforcement
agency
will
use
sk
to
decrypt
all
information
flowing
on
the
suspected
link
aside
it
is
my
guess
that
they
may
do
this
constantly
on
all
links
with
or
without
a
court
order
since
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
which
links
over
which
a
message
will
flow
my
understanding
is
that
there
will
be
only
one
decode
box
and
that
it
will
be
operated
by
the
fbi
the
service
provider
will
isolate
the
communications
stream
and
pass
it
to
the
fbi
where
it
will
pass
through
the
decode
box
which
will
have
been
keyed
with
k
for
the
wiretap
authorizations
when
levy
asked
for
the
details
so
he
could
review
the
cases
as
required
by
law
the
agent
told
him
that
his
predecessors
just
turned
over
blank
signed
forms
every
time
levi
did
not
comply
and
changed
the
system
but
the
lesson
is
clear
no
single
person
or
authority
should
have
the
power
to
authorize
wiretaps
no
single
person
does
at
least
for
fbi
taps
after
completing
a
mound
of
paperwork
an
agent
must
get
the
approval
of
several
people
on
a
chain
that
includes
fbi
legal
counsel
before
the
request
is
even
taken
to
the
attorney
general
for
final
approval

message
in
which
he
comments
on
the
effects
of
the
clipper
chip
on
state
and
local
police
actually
reading
between
the
lines
it
could
be
a
very
good
thing
for
civil
liberties
in
one
respect
since
it
will
at
least
prevent
cowboy
cops
and
cowboy
state
and
local
agancies
from
reading
your
traffic
if
they
tap
it
illegally
instead
of
reading
between
the
lines
try
to
think
a
little
bit
ok
if
thats
way
too
difficult
to
you
here
are
some
hints
indeed
the
new
proposal
imposes
some
additional
burocratic
burden
on
the
local
police
if
they
badly
want
to
tape
the
magic
cookie
recipie
that
your
mom
is
telling
you
on
the
phone
so
guess
what
they
will
do
propose
that
the
new
technology
is
removed
or
implement
some
facilitations
of
course
you
wont
want
to
wait
until
they
get
the
approval
from
two
different
agencies
to
decrypt
the
conversation
between
two
child
molesters
because
meanwhile
those
two
child
molesters
might
be
conspiring
about
molesting
your
child
right
so
there
should
be
some
way
for
them
to
get
access
to
those
keys
quickly
right
like
they
could
have
a
copy
of
the
database
and
worry
about
a
warrant
later

misinterpretation
though
it
should
be
a
crime
in
itself
is
what
united
states
lawyers
use
to
make
their
bread
and
butter
in
manchester
ct
a
few
years
ago
a
small
company
wanted
to
run
a
game
system
galled
lasergames
similar
in
many
aspects
to
photon
tm
three
lawyers
and
about
a
hundred
citizens
found
an
ancient
law
in
manchesters
books
which
clearly
from
context
was
designed
to
prohibit
travelling
carnivals
by
enumerating
the
features
of
a
carnival
which
they
felt
at
the
time
made
the
prohibition
obvious
among
these
things
was
shooting
galleries
which
is
what
the
lawyers
for
the
opposition
to
lasergames
wanted
to
harp
upon
the
judge
took
the
two
words
from
this
law
completely
out
of
context
and
ruled
that
lasergames
could
not
operate
in
manchester
keep
in
mind
that
most
travelling
carnivals
use
projectile
weapons
in
their
shooting
galleries
and
not
light
beams
clearly
from
context
lasergames
got
shafted
but
if
the
two
words
are
applied
their
denial
of
operating
permission
was
justified
if
i
had
the
text
of
the
law
id
post
it
but
im
afraid
i
dont
remember
it
all
well
enough
to
even

report
on
privacyprotecting
offline
cash
available
i
recently
published
a
new
privacyprotecting
offline
electronic
cash
system
as
a
technical
report
at
cwi
being
a
phdstudent
at
david
chaums
cryptographygroup
our
group
has
a
long
history
in
research
in
the
field
of
privacyprotecting
cash
systems
the
report
is
called
contains
pages
and
can
be
retrieved
from
ftpcwinl
from
the
directory
pubcwireportsaa
the
postscriptfile
is
suitable
for
laserprinters
abstract
from
coverpage
we
present
a
new
offline
electronic
cash
system
based
on
a
problem
called
the
representation
problem
of
which
little
use
has
been
made
in
literature
thus
far
our
system
is
the
first
to
be
based
entirely
on
discrete
logarithms
using
the
representation
problem
as
a
basic
concept
some
techniques
are
introduced
that
enable
us
to
construct
protocols
for
withdrawal
and
payment
that
do
not
use
the
cut
and
choose
methodology
of
earlier
systems
as
a
consequence
our
cash
system
is
much
more
efficient
in
both
computation
and
communication
complexity
than
any
such
system
proposed
previously
another
important
aspect
of
our
system
concerns
its
provability
contrary
to
previously
proposed
systems
its
correctness
can
be
mathematically
proven
to
a
very
great
extent
specifically
if
we
make
one
plausible
assumption
concerning
a
single
hashfunction
the
ability
to
break
the
system
seems
to
imply
that
one
can
break
the
diffiehellman
problem
our
system
offers
a
number
of
extensions
that
are
hard
to
achieve
in
previously
known
systems
in
our
opinion
the
most
interesting
of
these
is
that
the
entire
cash
system
including
all
the
extensions
can
be
incorporated
in
a
setting
based
on
wallets
with
observers
which
has
the
important
advantage
that
doublespending
can
be
prevented
in
the
first
place
rather
than
detecting
the
identity
of
a
doublespender
after
the
fact
in
particular
it
can
be
incorporated
even
under
the
most
stringent
requirements
conceivable
about
the
privacy
of
the
user
which
seems
to
be
impossible
to
do
with
previously
proposed
systems
another
benefit
of
our
system
is
that
framing
attempts
by
a
bank
have
negligible
probability
of
success
independent
of
computing
power
by
a
simple
mechanism
from
within
the
system
which
is
something
that
previous
solutions
lack
entirely
furthermore
the
basic
cash
system
can
be
extended
to
checks
multishow
cash
and
divisibility
while
retaining
its
computational
efficiency
cryptographers
are
challenged
to
try
to
break
this
system
i
made
a
particular
effort
to
keep
the
report
as
selfcontained
as
possible
nevertheless
if
you
have
any
questions
please
email
to
me
and
i
will
try
to
reply
as
good
as
i

i

him
when

he
also

why

one
could
then
build
physically
identical

that
would

the
cloner
wouldnt

hmmn
not

they
could
release
the
details

the

without
releasing
the

key
called

hellman
that
would
make
most
people
happy

with

verification
procedure
before

the
official

would

work

in

secrecy

makes

impossible
secrecy
of

revealing

opens
them
up

all

i

was
all

my

compromise

the

its
impossible

true
with

whats

this
is
part

why
i
am
not

it
per
se
trying

look
at

is
simply
ludicrous
its
a
voice
scrambler
nothing
more
there
is
still
plenty

as

its
better
than
the
status

well
first
of

you

get
a

from
companies
like

today
and
they
work
well
they
cost
an

a

though
clipper
is
obviously
aimed
at
the
mass

it
certainly
wont
put
cylink

in

a

groups
are
now
working

right
now
and
they

this

i
can

this
now
there
are
no

yet
you
can
use
anything
you
want
right
now
the
point
is
to
maintain
that
right
there
are

example

you

i

your

to

which
included
a
brief
passage
concerning
selection
of

as

agencies
i
am
glad
to
see
that
the
proposal
as
written
states
that
the
escrow
agencies
wont
be
law
enforcement
agencies
i
would
argue
however
that
one
of
the
escrow
agencies
shouldnt
be
federal
at
all
as
a
private
citizen
i
would
feel
much
more
secure
in
my
person
and
papers
knowing
that
an
organization
committed
to
individual
civil
liberties
the
aclu
and
the
nra
come
to
mind
was
safeguarding
half
of
my
key
both
the
aclu
and
the
nra
are
resistent
to
government
pressure
by
the
simple
expedient
fact
that
they
are
not
supported
funded
or
overtly
controlled
by
the
government
of
those
federal
and
federally
funded
candidate
agencies
that
you
mentioned
i
have
the
following
comments
sri
rand
mitre
and
national
labs
i
agree
that
they
have
great
experience
safeguarding
sensitive
information
i
am
not
convinced
that
they
would
adequately
safeguard
this
information
since
in
any
case
requiring
disclosure
theres
likely
to
be
sigificant
pressure
for
disclosure
possibly
wrongful
disclosure
gao
perhaps
i
would
like
to
see
more
concrete
evidence
of
their
fidelity
and
ability
treasury
surely
youre
joking
perhaps
youd
ask

maybe
the

would
be

choice

your

ability

agencies

agents
to
act
within
the
law
i
agree
with
you
in
part
those
agencies
and

almost
always
act
properly
however
there
have
been
enough
cases
where
sworn

this

the

of

martin

had
written

the

producing

serial

sk
to
which
i
responded
my
understanding
is
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
was
correct
in
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
however
skipjack
being
a
singlekey
system
there
is
of
course
not
a
separate
decrypt
key
for
the
family
key
sk
the

also
called
the

is
generated
from
the

follows
let

be
bit
blocks
derived
from
n
and
let

be
two
seeds
used
as

compute
the

note
that
this
is

using

im

about
whether
the

the

that

suggests
they
might
then

are
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
form
and
the

form
the
remaining
bits
are
discarded
the

and
do
not
change
the
whole
process
is
performed
on
a

people
so
that
no
one

knows
both
the

are
used
during
an
entire

session
to
generate

for

everything
is

at

end
the
computer

be
thrown
out
if
desired
the

and
the

formed
by

technical

hmm
followup
on
my
own
posting
well
who
cares
first
let
me
try
to
work
out
the
facts
that
we
get
to
know
about
the
clipperchip
from
what
hellman
and
denning
were
able
to
tell
us
the
chip
itself
is
not
confined
to
digital
telephony
but
performs
general
encryption
in
a
symmetric
manner
the
chip
supports
cfb
ofb
ecb
and
whatever
the
fourth
mode
of
operation
for
des
is
the
algorithm
consists
of
rounds
of
whatever
and
takes
keys
input
data
seems
to
be
bit
yes
so
if
two
people
want
secure
communication
whatever
that
means
when
clipper
is
involved
they
have
first
to
agree
on
one
secret
key
or
is
it
one
key
per
direction
they
can
exchange
this
key
via
dhschemes
or
however
somehow
the
two
feed
their
so
won
secret
key
into
the
clipperchip
which
is
now
ready
to
work
the
clipper
chip
carries
an
unique
serialnumber
bits
and
keybits
these
keybits
seem
to
have
been
gained
by
encrypting
the
serialnumber
with
seedbits
the
seedbits
seem
not
to
be
stored
in
the
chip
at
beginning
of
communication
and
perhaps
at
certain
invtervals
whithin
before
sending
the
fist
real
output
of
the
first
encryption
the
clipper
chip
puts
out
packets
i
guess
which
represent
the
serial
number
and
the
session
key
this
might
look
like
x
ek
serial
number
where
x
is
a
transformation
of
these
packets
involving
a
familykey
this
familyspkey
is
equal
for
all
chips
x
might
be
a
simple
xor
after
that
the
digital
phonecall
can
be
done
as
usual
every
packet
being
encrypted
and
decrypted
by
clipper
denning
describes
how
and
shall
be
generated
using
a
seed
of
bits
now
leaving
alone
politics
which
does
not
concern
me
as
much
as
you
not
being
an
american
citicientm
there
are
some
weak
points
in
this
scheme
which
might
be
exploited
by
several
parties
as
far
as
i
know
about
the
generation
of
and
look
like
the
obvious
backdoor
they
could
be
used
to
generate
the
chipkeys
by
knowing
the
serialnumber
and
also
the
familykey
of
the
chip
i
really
cant
imagine
why
these
seeds
would
be
needed
otherwise
as
true
randomsources
for
the
generation
of
the
can
be
bought
for
not
to
much
money
then
the
escrows
each
of
them
will
get
bit
of
a
key
security
could
as
little
as
existant
be
maximized
by
giving
them
each
which
have
to
be
xored
together
to
give
the
now
lets
simply
assume
the
escrows
are
trustworthy
and
cant
be
fooled
by
criminals
or
law
enforchemnt
agencies
and
there
will
be
no
quarrel
between
escrows
and
lea
which
would
hinder
the
lea
in
doing
their
duties
and
so
on
and
so
on
once
the
keys
are
surrendered
the
corresponding
chip
is
compromised
forever
not
very
clever
imho
how
about
sending
in
the
encrypted
sessionkeys
for
each
phonecall
that
the
police
or
whoever
wants
to
listen
to
escrows
could
then
simply
decode
this
sessionkey
and
send
it
back
to
police
and
would
naturally
not
do
this
after
the
warrant
has
expired
this
would
be
a
better
technical
solution
but
i
guess
politics
will
not
work
that
way
apparently
as
miss
dennings
stated
the
only
one
performing
actually
decodes
of
intercepted
messages
shall
be
the
fbi
great
so
local
guys
can
not
inter
cept
understand
your
traffic
anymore
does
this
mean
that
the
fbi
monopolizes
the
right
to
do
legal
wiretaps
how
is
law
over
there
i
have
no
idea
who
is
allowed
to
tap
and
who
not
this
certainly
means
that
watched
communi
cations
will
be
routed
automatically
from
the
serviceproviding
company
to
the
fbi
if
the
communicaiton
is
a
watched
one
and
this
means
as
far
as
i
understand
it
that
the
familykey
has
to
be
known
by
each
switching
company
and
those
providing
cellularphone
servies
etcetc
so
the
familykey
will
not
be
very
secret
and
thus
serialnumbers
of
calls
will
be
readable
by
anybody
who
cares
i
like
trafficanalysis
what
do
you
guess
what
happens
if
you
use
the
chip
in
ecb
mode
and
the
first
few
packets
of
the
chip
are
somehow
lost
or
garbled
so
the
session
key
would
not
be
actually
broadcasted
over
the
line
hmmm
shouldnt
be
so
difficult
to
do
that
and
now
a
last
point
for
the
other
side
after
all
i
have
read
and
heard
about
clipper
not
the
programming
language
for
dbase
is
it
it
seems
to
have
many
advantages
which
shold
not
be
overseen
now
an
afterthought
to
your
rights
please
note
that
i
have
no
idea
what
i
am
talking
about
from
gradynetcomcom

congress

make
no

if

is

in

of

who
can
overrule

but
freedom

is
not

maybe
you
need
to
extend
your

to
cover
information
and
communication
too
i
am
not
very
sure
in
what
position
your

actually
is

when
it
tries

and

say
you

i
wholeheartedly
agree
knowing
that
we
have
let
our
law
enforcement
agencies
seize
our
property
against
the
fifth
amendment
of
our
constitution
tells
me
that
we
are
absolving
ourselves
of
our
responsibility
for
selfgovernance
we
have
to
take
our
government
back
from
the
selfserving
politicians
who
create
laws
and
rules
only
to
better
their
positions
within
the
government
we
have
allowed
them
to
take
too
much
power
from
the
people
of
this
nation
that
situation
has
to
be
changed
allowing
the
law
enforcement
agencies
to
use
the
seized
property
to
payoff
drug
informants
who
lie
and
continue
to
deal
in
drugs
is
tantamount
to
making
a
pact
with
the
devil
himself
its
a
vicious
cycle
the
law
enforcement
agencies
are
motivated
to
seize
property
to
fund
their
own
activities
and
having
no
easy
way
for
the
citizen
to
regain
the
property
intact
once
taken
gives
even
more
incentive
for
the
agencies
to
take
property
its
also
interesting
to
note
that
two
months
ago
rush
limbaugh
said
that
clinton
would
have
the
plumbers
out
in
force
shortly
clinton
and
his
henchmen
firmly
believe
in
strong
ubiquitous
government
control
anytime
a
leader
believes
in
that
the
leader
will
use
every
means
possible
to
retain
that
control
and
take
more
we
have
to
take
our
government
back
otherwise
we
will
end
up
living
in
the
equivalent
of
a
hightech
third
world

we
have
to

april
statement
by
the
press

the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
hum
att
vlsi
and
mykotronx
are
industry
wonder
what
happened
to
ibm
this
should
be
right
up
their
street
and
a
mandateed
scheme
is
voluntary
mr
orwell
would
love
this
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
telephone
encryption
and
scrambleing
are
years
behind
digital
ones
like
rsa
idea
or
even
des
the
above
while
literaly
true
is
a
clasic
strawman
claim
in
the
context
of
nonrealtime
circuits
such
as
email
and
the
like
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
i
would
modestly
propose
that
a
mandated
use
of
isdn
would
do
more
for
commun
ications
than
this
lot
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
normmaly
des
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
note
the
use
of
the
word
business
in
the
above
the
whole
tenor
of
this
release
seems
to
be
establishing
a
ground
rule
that
only
business
use
is
legitimate
for
debate
if
you
want
the
nothings
you
drop
in
your
wifes
ear
to
remain
secret
and
private
that
is
not
even
on
the
agenda
for
debate
note
that
there
is
no
role
for
you
to
contain
private
info
in
this
the
only
reference
is
to
information
already
in
the
hands
of
others
the
unauthorized
release
bit
is
also
drawing
a
long
bow
most
of
these
cases
are
by
people
who
have
legitimate
access
abusing
it
and
revealing
or
often
selling
the
info
these
people
are
of
course
in
this
proposal
the
people
who
will
have
the
keys
the
criminals
also
use
lawers
courts
the
cia
whitehouse
officials
and
pens
to
go
about
their
business
when
will
they
be
outlawed
as
well
yeah
several
of
them
would
be
a
better
idea
than
clipper
them
again
the
protections
of
law
and
the
courts
have
been
seriously
erroded
over
the
last
decade
ofr
so
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
nsa
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
yeah
this
bit
is
very
true
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
note
the
repeated
mixing
of
telephone
scrabeling
and
encryption
a
demo
of
the
above
claim
on
an
ordanary
pots
would
be
a
good
nights
entertainment
i
suspect
note
also
the
many
not
all
as
the
general
tone
implies
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
the
case
record
seems
to
indicate
that
what
is
needed
is
a
brutal
tightening
of
the
current
abuses
i
have
not
heard
yet
of
a
case
that
was
impeaded
by
the
use
of
secure
encryption
by
the
men
in
black
the
other
side
abuse
by
law
enforcers
is
well
documented
even
by
govt
agencies
and
the
phone
vs
other
coms
is
blurred
yet
again
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
lets
run
that
line
twice
not
very
carefully
what
it
says
the
stated
purpose
of
the
key
eschrow
is
to
make
the
use
of
clipper
compulsory
note
the
word
ensure
as
to
protect
or
lawabiding
i
will
leave
to
you
so
to
the
person
who
asked
if
it
included
the
outlawing
of
other
encryptions
the
answer
in
this
press
release
is
yes
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
just
as
they
only
can
wiretap
now
with
a
warrent
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
just
makes
sure
that
the
illegal
ones
are
preserved
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
where
do
you
find
many
experts
any
ex
kgb
people
looking
for
a
contract
and
as
a
later
posting
asks
what
of
the
stuiiis
they
already
have
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
see
if
the
military
and
us
embasies
start
to
use
it
after
all
it
is
secure
isnt
it
the
govt
will
answer
that
point
by
its
own
actions
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
again
personal
use
seems
to
be
a
unaskable
question
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
ah
so
warrents
are
not
always
needed
it
seems
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
itars
seem
to
slightly
impeed
this
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as
policy
options
are
developed
the
administration
is
committed
to
working
with
the
private
sector
to
spur
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
which
will
use
new
telecommunications
and
computer
technologies
to
give
americans
unprecedented
access
to
information
this
infrastructure
of
highspeed
networks
information
superhighways
will
transmit
video
images
hdtv
programming
and
huge
data
files
as
easily
as
todays
telephone
system
transmits
voice
note
that
all
this
wonderfull
stuff
will
be
in
secret
only
the
proper
people
will
be
able
to
express
an
opinion
hence
only
the
desired
result
will
emerge
since
encryption
technology
will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop
consistent
comprehensive
policies
regarding
its
use
the
administration
is
committed
to
policies
that
protect
all
americans
right
to
privacy
while
also
protecting
them
from
those
who
break
the
law
encryption
and
codes
have
been
around
for
millenia
they
are
generaly
in
equilibrium
with
the
technology
of
the
time
the
systematic
study
of
cyphers
has
resulted
in
a
swing
in
favor
of
the
encrypter
at
the
moment
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
factoring
problem
will
fall
in
time
probably
fofr
practical
purposes
by
the
middle
of
the
next
century
further
information
is
provided
in
an

questions

about
the
clinton
administrations
telecommunications
initiative
q
does
this
approach
expand
the
authority
of
government
agencies
to
listen
in
on
phone
conversations
a
no
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
q
who
will
run
the
keyescrow
data
banks
a
the
two
keyescrow
data
banks
will
be
run
by
two
independent
entities
at
this
point
the
department
of
justice
and
the
administration
have
yet
to
determine
which
agencies
will
oversee
the
keyescrow
data
banks
it
is
a
little
hard
to
critisise
a
nonproposal
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
note
we
drop
back
to
phonemode
again
if
this
is
a
true
answer
it
can
be
rephrased
as
it
sucks
big
time
anyone
who
can
drive
the
crypt
workbench
will
use
it
for
light
amusement
before
breakfast
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
this
link
between
the
security
of
the
keyeschrow
and
the
actual
algorithm
is
a
real
winner
given
that
i
have
secret
bit
numbers
could
someone
please
explain
how
the
details
of
an
encryption
algorithm
will
reveal
them
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
just
make
sure
you
read
the
cvs
real
carfully
ok
q
whose
decision
was
it
to
propose
this
product
a
the
national
security
council
the
justice
department
the
commerce
department
and
other
key
agencies
were
involved
in
this
decision
this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
quick
with
out
looking
back
what
name
is
missing
from
that
list
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
the
people
who
agree
with
us
and
who
think
there
is
a
buck
in
it
for
them
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the
chip
manufacturer
that
produces
them
the
reverse
engineering
provisions
of
the
maskwork
act
could
be
relevent
here
q
who
provides
the
clipper
chip
a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their
facility
in
torrance
california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
you
dont
not
unless
you
are
one
of
the
right
people
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
they
missed
the
word
secret
here
he
needs
a
grammar
lesson
too
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
i
would
say
less
secure
less
conveniant
more
expensive
pgp
is
free
less
available
and
more
prone
to
being
comprimised
proofs
to
the
contarary
will
be
welcome
note
proof
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
they
dont
seem
to
be
saying
anything
that
makes
much
sense
and
this
proposal
does
prohibit
it
except
in
a
very
limited
way
and
this
is
the
one
explicit
reference
to
personal
rights
it
is
a
denial
and
yes
i
dont
think
that
the
mexicans
brazilians
and
canucks
are
included
in
clinton
et
als
magnanamous
gesture
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
the
false
tension
is
false
the
balance
is
between
two
repugnant
points
the
right
to
privacy
is
handwaved
to
nonexistance
by
putting
it
behind
the
false
assessment
it
is
assumed
that
the
removal
of
the
right
to
take
what
ever
steps
you
deem
suitable
to
protect
your
privacy
is
non
negotiable
hence
is
defined
in
the
govenment
language
to
be
nonexistant
if
you
dont
agree
you
must
be
a
criminal
as
only
criminals
dont
agree
with
out
laws
also
note
the
non
question
if
what
is
here
was
not
possible
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
it
indicates
we
know
that
bush
dropped
the
ball
in
squashing
that
nasty
insert
suitable
retoric
and
will
stamp
out
this
disorderly
unruley
outbreak
of
freedom
and
ultranational
sentiment
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of
these
products
this
one
is
a
real
giggle
in
australia
or
france
they
will
have
to
reveal
the
keys
and
the
algorithm
dont
think
its
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
things
i
must
have
so
the
restrictions
will
protect
me
from
saleks
trying
to
sell
me
a

any
for
any
others
using
it
they
must
be

good

folks
paul
subject
re
more
technical
details
the
system
or
family
key
would
appear
to
be
cryptographically
useless
since
every
chip
must
know
it
and
be
able
to
remove
its
effects
from
the
bitstream
i
daresay
that
it
will
be
widely
known
almost
immediately
after
this
system
is
deployed
and
since
its
been
pointed
out
that
there
is
not
a
separate
decrypt
key
the
same
key
is
used
for
both
encryption
and
decryption
there
goes
any
benefit
to
the
use
of
a
systemwide

id
be

supplied

if

it

more

resistant

i
for

id
be

to
do
so
even
with

provided
i
was
happy
about
the
bona

the

maybe
the

eff
it

the

trust

actually

but
the

has
embraced

both

what

i
have
a
question
that
is
a
slight
variation
on
the
previously
mentioned
examples
that
perhaps
people
could
give
me
some
pointers
on
it
has
been
a
couple
of
years
since
my
con
law
class
in
college
so
i
hope
i
am
not
missing
something
obvious
here
basic
scenario
i
set
up
a
bbs
that
uses
publickey
encryption
and
encryption
of
files
on
disk
the
general
setup
is
designed
so
that
when
users
connect
they
send
a
private
key
encrypted
using
the
system
public
key
and
the
users
publicprivate
keypair
is
used
to
wrap
the
onetime
session
keys
used
for
encrypting
the
files
on
disk
the
result
of
this
is
that
even
if
i
reveal
the
system
private
key
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
gain
access
to
the
files
stored
on
the
machine
what
is
possible
is
for
someone
to
use
the
revealed
system
private
key
to
entice
users
into
revealing
thier
personal
private
keys
during
the
authentication
sequence
questions
does
the
fact
that
the
system
private
key
does
not
provide
any
information
useful
for
a
search
give
me
any
protection
as
far
as
being
coerced
to
reveal
the
key
i
doubt
it
myself
it
seems
providing
the
system
private
key
does
not
mean
that
i
am
assisting
in
entrapment
the
users
would
send
thier
key
anyway
and
are
not
being
enticed
into
doing
something
they
would
not
otherwise
do
but
is
there
any
other
hook
that
can
be
used
would
the
user
privatekey
enticement
require
wiretap
approval
any
answers
or
general
musings
on
the
subject
would
be

in

by

bellovin
etal
it
was
reported
the
big

clipper
chip
will

as
is
done
with
des
the
users
key
k
which
can
be
derived
from
rsa
diffyhellman
etc
is
used
to
encrypt
plaintext
m
and
is
then
used
to
form
a
three
part
message
this
three
part
message
consists
of
em
k
k
encrypted
with
some
other
key
and
the
chip
serial
number
this
three
part
message
is
then
encrypted
by
still
another
key
my
question
is
what
is
a
message
for
example
say
we
are
dealing
with
an
encrypted
digitized
voice
application
the
speech
waveform
is
sampled
and
digitized
and
then
some
number
of
samples
are
grouped
into
a
bit
block
this
block
is
then
encrypted
and
transmitted
over
a
nonsecure
communications
link
where
is
the
three
part
message
is
something
appended
to
each
bit
block
is
a
header
sent
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
if
the
header
is
sent
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
how
do
they
insure
the
equipment
manufacturer
using
the
chip
does
just
that
can
just
anyone
manufacture
products
using
the
chip
is
a
facility

acutally
with

then
i

you
also
would

the

coming
up

is
a

not
a

sprung

us
to
start
placing
video
cameras
with
sound
in
every
room
of
your

which
could
be

without
your

they
would
be
well

you
wouldnt

the

prevent
you
from
covering
the
lens
opening
after
all
nothing
youre

would
be

the
slightest
interest

official
right
so
you
surely
should
not
object
to
such
a
proposal
not
the
best
anology
but
the
principle
is
pretty
close
the
ability
to
eavesdrop
on
your
activity
with
little
or
no
effort
without
your
knowlege
protected
by
entirely
by
government
safeguards
you
can
still
draw
your
curtains
so
you
can
still
have
your
privacy
from
everyone
else
except
big
brother
after
all
we
need
this
for
protection
from
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
and
other
criminals
like
enemies
of
the
state
and
you
dont
really
have
a
right
to
unbreakable
privacy
anyway
sort
of
as
the
press
release
of
the
clinton
cripple
decision
puts
it
i
find
it
curious
they
use
the
word
unbreakable
when
the
term
really
should
be
difficult
to
break
without
proper
authorization
which
the
government
most
certainly
has
at
their
disposal
right
they
wouldnt
want
to
be
able
to
break
it
illegally
would
they
nawww
not
for
the
people
clinton
can
you
while
my
mind
is
on
it
give
us
one
good
reason
that
the
algorithm
should
be
a
secret
algorithm
unless
this
encryption
scheme
either
is
a
joke
or
contains
features
like
a
master
key
or
other
back
door
for
unauthorized
eavesdropping
if
it
was
really
even
moderately
secure
and
the
government
really
meant
to
require
the
proper
court
order
and
the
keys
that
are
in
the
escrow
accounts
to
be
able
to
decipher
the
traffic
what
is
the
need
to
keep
the
algorithm
secret
seems
i
hear
rather
often
that
if
an
encryption
scheme
requires
the
algorithm
to
remain
a
secret
to
be
effective
it
is
not
a
worthwhile
scheme
is
this
just
idle
talk
or
is
the
administration
bullshitting
everyone
with
great
skepticism
and
many
doubts
on
our
administrations
intentions
and
wait
we
havent
been
told
the
next
gem
the
administration
has
in
mind
for
email
and
datafile
security
the
press
release
does
say
that
this
is
part
of
a
comprehensive
thing
on

security
for
us
unprivileged

perhaps
subjects
would
be
the
better

citizens
somehow
does
not

their
phones
tapped
none
of
this
is
theoretical
to
me
as
for
its
better
than
the
status
quo
well
first
of
all
you
can
get
a
cryptophone
from
companies
like
cylink
today
and
they
work
well
in
addition
a
number
of
groups
are
now
working
on
building
software
to
turn
any
pc
into
a
privacy
enhanced
phone
right
now
and
they
are
all
working
in
overdrive
mode
and
yes
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto
restrictions
lifted
but
this
is
at
least
an
incrememental
improvement
for
certain
applications
there
are
no
crypto
restrictions
yet
you
can
use
anything
you
want
right
now
the
point
is
to
maintain
that
right
the
point
you
all
seem
to
have
missed
was
covered
when
the
uk
cellphone
scrambling
system
was
discussed
incidentally
my
mp
has
responded
to
my
questions
on
that
issue
and
it
appears
that
the
uk
and
other
approved
countries
will
get
the
secure
encryption
and
dodgy
countries
will
get
existing
mobile
equipment
will
drop
to
clear
mode
when
used
with
systems
but
newer
equipment
will
use
depending
on
the
capabilities
of
the
base
station
the
copsfeds
do
not
need
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
your
private
key
to
listen
in
to
cellular
conversations
encryption
is
not
endtoend
but
cellphone
to
basestation
it
has
to
be
this
way
so
that
cellular
users
and
fixed
installations
can
talk
to
each
other
for
cellular
to
cellular
calls
the
transmission
is
decrypted
at
the
basestation
passed
to
another
basestation
and
reencrypted
the
copsfeds
can
listen
to
the
unscrambled
call
provided
they
get
a
warrant
to
tap
into
the
cellular
providers
equipment
the
only
reason
for
wanting
a
crackable
system
is
so
they
can
listen
without
having
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
maybe
the
clipper
system
is
secure
and
they
really
do
need
a
warrant
to
get
the
key
out
of
escrow
before
they
can
listen
in
using
a
scanner
see
above
they
dont
have
to
go
down
this
route
anyway
i
have
my
doubts
but
even
if
true
once
they
have
the
key
they
will
never
again
need
a
warrant
to
tap
into
that
particular
phone
whenever
they
want
well
judge
it
appears
he
wasnt
a
drugdealer
after
all
so
naturally
well
stop
listening

i

since
once
the

are
handed
over
by

the

is
so
much
garbage
and
will
need

be
replaced
i
expect
that
someone
will
come
along
with
a
pin

chip
that
uses
secure
encryption
possibly
even
disguised
so
that
its
not
possible
to
tell
it
from

until
you
try
to
use

if
i
were
to
manufacture
such
a

of

marketing
strategy
i
would
try
to
subvert
one
or
both

either
through
bribes

industrial
espionage
and
then
publicize

doing

not

which
would
likely
not

publicly
discrediting

would
go
quite
far
towards
creating
a

for
a

i
also
believe
that
someone
will
reverse
engineer
the
clipper
chip
and
knowlege
of
the
algorithm
will
likely
be
fairly
widespread
any
back
doors
or
weaknesses
would
further
discredit
the
scheme
and
help
grow
the
market
demand
for
a
secure
alternative
i
believe
that
the
company
that
provides
such
an
alternative
will
make
few
friends
in

lots
of
money
i
also
believe
that
the

will
do

best
to
make

illegal
i
expect
that

will
see
the

success

at
the

from
both

the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all

throughput
is
mbits

each

includes
the

the

f
an

my

in

the

the

at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
an
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
an
value
these
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial

to
generate
the

for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce

and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to

the
second

to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit

u
is
the
xor
of

and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
as
a
sequence
of
values
for
and
u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial
number
that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second
disk
is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third
disk
contains
the
unit
keys
u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second
disk
the
third
disk
is
used
to
program
the
chips
after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the
vault
and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
the
protocol
may
be
changed
slightly
so
that
four
people
are
in
the
room
instead
of
two
the
first
two
would
provide
the
seeds
and
and
the
second
two
the
escrow
agents
would
take
the
disks
back
to
the
escrow
agencies
the
escrow
agencies
have
as
yet
to
be
determined
but
they
will
not
be
the
nsa
cia
fbi
or
any
other
law
enforcement
agency
one
or
both
may
be
independent
from
the
government
law
enforcement
use
when
law
enforcement
has
been
authorized
to
tap
an
encrypted
line
they
will
first
take
the
warrant
to
the
service
provider
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
communications
line
let
us
assume
that
the
tap
is
in
place
and
that
they
have
determined
that
the
line
is
encrypted
with
clipper
they
will
first
decrypt
the
law
enforcement
block
with
the
family
key
f
this
gives
them
ek

they
will
then
take
a
warrant
identifying
the
chip
serial
number
n
to
each
of
the
key
escrow
agents
and
get
back
and
and
are
xored
together
to
produce
the
unit
key
u
and
ek
u
is
decrypted
to
get
the
session
key
k
finally
the

stream
is
decrypted
all
this
will
be
accomplished
through
a
special
black

operated
by
the

notice
all

clipper
and
ranting

i
would
think
that
you
could
reduce
the
defense
of
using
nonclipper
based
encryption
technologies
to
defending
freedom
of
expression
ie
free

that
you
have
to
right
to
express
whatever
you
want
in
whatever
form
your
little
heart
desires
so
long
as
you
do
not
impinge
on
the
rights
of
others
encrypted
textsoundvideo
is
just
another
form
of
expression
of
that
particular
textsoundvideo
just
like
digitized
sound
is
another
means
of
expression
of
sound
streams
of
instead
of
continuous

also
it
shouldnt
be
up
to
the
government
at
all
encryption
standards
can
be
decided
upon
by
independent
standards
orgainizations
apologies
for
the
acronym
one
can
note
how
well
this
has
worked
with
iso
and
the
metric
system
sae
etc
independent
entities
or
consortia
of
peopleindustries
in
that
particular
area
are
far
more
qualified
to
set
standards
than
any
one
government
agency
consider
for
example
what
the
ascii
character
set
would
have
looked
like
if
it
was
decided
by

i
hope
this

would
clipper
make
a
good
cover
for
other
encryption
method
clipper
might
be
a
good
way
to
cover
the
use
of
another
layer
of
encryption
currently
when
you
send
an
encrypted
message
an
opponent
can
usually
tell
that
you
are
using
encryption
which
encryption
method
you
are
using
because
that
information
is
usually
in
the
clear
with
clipper
most
opponents
will
only
know
that
you
are
sending
clippertext
they
wont
know
that
your
clippertext
is
itself
encoded
only
those
few
opponents
who
get
your
clipperkeys
will
know
that
your
message
is
double
encrypted
kind
of
like
a
safety
deposit
box
containing
a
lock

so
dont
just
think
of

think

their
strategy
is
a
business
one
rather
than
legal
one
they
are
pushing
to
get
a
standard
in
place
a
secret
standard
and
if
they
get
it
as
a
standard
then
they
will
drive
competitors
out
of
the
market
it
will
be
legal
to
sell
better
untapable
encryption
that
doesnt
have
registered
keys
but
it
will
be
difficult
and
thus
not
a
plan
for
most
phone
companies
if
brads
analysis
is
correct
it
may
offer
an
explanation
for
why
the
encryption
algorithm
is
being
kept
secret
this
will
prevent
competitors
from
coming
out
with
clippercompatible
phones
which
lack
the
government
installed
back
door
the
strategy
brad
describes
will
only
work
as
long
as
the
only
way
to
get
compatible
phones
is
to
have
ones
with
the
government
chips
it
would
be
nice
from
the
point
of
view
of
personal
privacy
if
brad
turns
out
to
be
right
as
long
as
people
still
have
the
power
to
provide
their
own
encryption
in
place
of
or
in
addition
to
the
clipper
privacy
is
still
possible
but
the
wording
of
several
passages
in
the
announcement
makes
me
doubt
whether
this
will
turn
out
to
be
true
even
if
what
brad
says
turns
out
to
be
accurate
you
can
bet
that
the
administration
will
have
made
it
very
clear
to
the
vendors
that
it
would
very
much
be
in
their
best
interests
to
institute
a
voluntary
policy
of
refusing
to
sell
anything
but
clinton
cripple
equipped
equipment
to
anyone
other
than
authorized
government
agencies
and
law
enforcement
or
individuals
and
corporations
who
have
been
been
determined
by
the
administration
to
have
a
valid
need
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
an
effective
system
note
that
this
is
very
much
like
the
language
used
in
many
gun
control
billslaws
the
administration
is
pushing
for
or
otherwise
supporting
the
logic
and
actual
rationale
as
opposed
to
the
excuses
that
get
fed
to
the
media
is
the
same
in
both
cases
only
the
items
or
technology
in
question
are
different
i
think
this
is
no
accident
it
comes
from
the
same
philosophy
that
the
government
rulescontrols
the
people
not
the
people
controlling
the
government
that
the
unconnected
citizens
are
not
sophisticated
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
them
so
the
government
must
tell
the
people
what
they
need
or
do
not
need
we
know
best
and
the
idea
that
that
a
commoner
can
defend
himself
against
government
eavesdropping
or
unlawful
attack
is
totally
unacceptable
to
people
with
this
outlook
hal
finney
combine
this
all
with
pushing
for
national
identity
cards
with
smart
chips
to
encode
anything
they
please
internal
passport
under
the
guise
of
streamlining
the
state
peoples
health
care
system
and
with
you
can
be
certain
more
jewels
yet
to
come
and
one
sees
an
extremely
ominous
trend
so
what
if
will
be
ten
years
late
it
still
is
turning
out
to
be
an
amazingly
accurate
prophecy
unless
a
lot
of
people
wake
up
and
in
a
hurry
one
should
always
have
every
red
warning
light
and
bell
and
danger
flag
come
up
when
the
government
seeks
to
set
itself
apart
in
regard
to
rights
etc
from
the
unconnectedunprivileged
citizen
or
should
we
now
be
saying
subject
instead
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
have
a
good
secure
system
of
data
security
not
dependent
on
nebulous
safeguards
for
maintaining
that
security
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
be
able
to
defend
himself
from
an
agency
gone
rogue
am
sure
the
feds
could
break
into
any
data
they
really
wanted
to
but
it
would
take
some
work
and
using
the
same
logic
one
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
good
safe
unless
a
duplicate
of
the
keys
or
combination
are
submitted
for
safekeeping
by
the
government
i
dont
really
see
a
difference

k

called

and
that
the
decrypt

corresponding
to

is
held
by

enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
will
also
check
it
out
but
this
is
sunday
so
i
did
not
want
to
wait
ok
so
there
are
in
fact
two
distinct
components
transmitted
by
the
chip
the
real
message
encrypted
with
the
conventional
key
and
the
serial
number
and
encrypted
conventional
key
encrypted
with
the
imho
kind
of
bogus
as
the
whole
concept
of
one
key
that
millions
of
people
use
which
cant
be
changed
doesnt
seem
reasonable
family
key
suppose
i
analyze
the
output
of
this
chip
and
im
able
to
determine
which
bits
are
the
encrypted
packet
which
contains
the
serial
number
and
session
key
suppose
i
also
design
a
simple
algorithm
based
on
this
information
which
takes
the
data
containing
the
encrypted
session
key
and
twiddles
a
bit
or
several
before
its
sent
down
the
line
mind
you
im
sure
the
nsa
thought
of
this
along
with
a
dozen
other
attacks
i
cant
imagine
and
the
system
is
probably
somehow
designed
so
that
manipulation
of
this
information
will
cause
a
compliant
receiving
chip
to
somehow
fail
to
decrypt
successfully
but
how
what
if
the
two
parties
agree
in
advance
on
some
kind
of
consistent
bittwiddling
scheme
so
the
decryption
chip
sees
the
restored
proper
bitstream
but
an
eavesdropper
gets
a
ek
uk
packet
thats
wrong
i
suppose
this
could
be
easily
defeated
if
the
chip
sends
that
information
out
many
times
in
slightly
different
ways
making
it
effectively
impossible
to
be
certain
you
know
all
the
information
being
sent

the
escrow
database
here
is
a
disturbing
thought
now
we
no
longer
live
in
the
days
of
big
filing
cabinets
we
live
in
the
electronic
age
i
asked
myself
how
big
could
the
escrow
database
get
how
hard
might
it
be
to
steal
the
whole
thing
particularly
were
i
an
nsa
official
operating
with
the
tacit
permission
of
the
escrow
houses
we
can
pretend
that
such
will
not
happen
but
thats
naive
well
lets
see
ten
bytes
of
each
escrow
half
lets
asume
ten
bytes
of
serial
number
in
fact
i
believe
the
serial
number
is
smaller
but
this
is
an
order
of
magnitude
calculation
we
assume
as
the
population
and
that
each
person
has
a
key
i
get
five
gigabytes
for
each
of
the
two
escrow
databases
fits
conveniently
on
a
single
very
valuable
exabyte
tape
this
can
only
get
easier
with
time
but
who
cares
i
can
already
hold
all
the
clipper
keys
in
the
country
in
my
pocket
on
two
tapes
admittely
they
will
think
of
safeguards
they
wont
put
the
whole
database
on
one
disk
prehaps
maybe
they
will
throw
stumbling
blocks
in
the
way
this
changes
nothing
they
keys
will
be
needed
every
day
by
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
law
enforcement
types
so
convenience
will
dictate
that
the
system
permit
quick
electronic
retrieval
at
some
point
with
or
without
collusion
by
the
agencies
those
exabyte
tapes
are
going
to
get
cut
dorothy
denning
and
david
sternlight
will
doubtless
claim
this
cant
happen
but
we
know
that
cant
is
a
prayer
not
a
word
that
in
this
instance
connotes
realism
with
two
exabyte
tapes
in
your
pocket
you
would
hold
the
keys
for
every
persons
conversations
in
the
country
in
your
hands
yeah
you
need
the
master
key
two
but
thats
just
ten
bytes
of
information
that
have
to
be
stored
an
awful
lot
of
places
come
to
think
of
it
even
if
the
nsa
getting
a
copy
of
the
database
isnt
a
threat
to
you
because
unlike
me
you
have
no
contraversial
political
views
consider
foreign
intelligence
services
you
know
the
ones
that
david
sternlight
wants
to
protect
us
from
because
of
the
evil
industrial
espionage
that
they
do
the
french
apparently
do
have
a
big
spying
operation
in
friendly
countries
to
get
industrial
secrets
so
he
isnt
being
completely
irrational
here
although
why
our
companies
couldnt
use
cryptosystems
without
back
doors
is
left
unexplained
by
those
that
point
out
this
threat
presumably
foreign
intelligence
services
can
get
moles
into
the
nsa
and
other
agencies
we
have
proof
by
example
of
this
its
happened
many
times
presumably
someday
they
will
get
their
hands
on
some
fraction
of
the
keys
you
cant
avoid
that
sort
of
thing
dont
pretend
that
no
one
unauthorized
will
ever
get
their
hands
on
the
escrow
databases
we
crypto
types
are
all
taught
something
very
important
at
the
beginning
of
intro
to
cryptography
security
must
depend
on
the
easily
changed
key
that
you
pick
to
run
your
system
and
not
on
a
secret
the
escrow
databases
arent
the
sorts
of
secrets
that
our
teachers
told
us
about
but
they
are
the
sort
of
big
secrets
they
would
lump
into
this
category
imagine
trying
to
replace
million
clipper
chips
i
cannot
believe
that
the
nsa
or
whomever
it
is
thats
doing
this
doesnt
realize
all
this
already
they
are
too
smart
there
are
too
many
of
them
who
have
made
their
bones
in
the
real
world
i
suspect
that
they
know
precisely
what
they
are
doing
and
that
what
they
are
doing
is
giving
us
the
appearance
of
safety
so
that
they
can
continue
to
surveil
in
spite
of
the
growth
of
strong
cryptography
i
suspect
that
they
realize
that
they
cant
put
things
off
forever
but
they
can
try
to
delay
things
as
long
as
possible
who
knows
maybe
even
some
of
the
higher
ups
the
inevitable
bureaucratic
types
that
rise
in
any
organization
really
do
believe
that
this
scheme
might
give
people
some
security

as

so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individuals
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
the
supreme
court
seems
to
disagree
with
you
they
have
stated
that
the
people
is
a
term
of
art
refering
to
an
individual
right
and
have
explicitly
mentioned
the
second
amendment
as
an
example
i
quote
the
people
seems
to
have
been
a
term
of
art
employed
in
select
parts
of
the
constitution
the
preamble
declares
that
the
constitution
is
ordained
and
established
by
the
people
of
the
the
us
the
second
amendment
protects
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
supreme
court
of
the
us
us
v
uerdugouriquidez
furthermore
in
the
miller
decision
they
only
permitted
prosecution
for
possession
of
a
sawedoff
shotgun
because
the
defense
had
not
presented
testimony
and
they
therefore
accepted
the
argument
of
the
government
that
such
weapons
have
no
military
value
they
held
that
the
amendment
protected
the
individual
right
to
possess
military
weapons
unfortunately
no
second
amendment
case
has
successfully
gotten
to
the
court
in
fifty
years
however
that
does
not
change
the
interpretation
furthermore
it
appears
that
others
disagree
with
you
as
well
vis
the
conclusion
is
thus
inescapable
that
the
history
concept
and
wording
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
its
interpretation
by
every
major
commentator
and
court
in
the
first
halfcentury
after
its
ratifi
cation
indicates
that
what
is
protected
is
an
individual
right
of
a
private
citizen
to
own
and
carry
firearms

session
february
you
might
rightfully
ask
well
then
what
does
that
first
bit
about
militias
mean
well
militia
in
historical
context
basically
means
the
whole
of
the
adult
males
of
the
country
indeed
the
us
code
still
defines
militia
as
all
armed
men
over
the
age
of
the
militia
comprised
all
males
physically
capable
of
acting
in
concert
for
the
common
defense
and
these
men
were
expected
to
appear
bearing
arms

by
themselves
and
of
the
kind
in
common
use
at
the
time
supreme
court
of

us
v
miller
the
reason
for
the
phrase
being
there
was
to
explain
the
rationale
behind
the
amendment
which
was
this
by
depending
on
the
people
to
bear
arms
in
defense
of
the
country
no
centralization
of
military
power
could
ever
occur
which
would
permit
tyranny
in
short
the

would
remain
perpetually
in
fear
of
the
people
rather
than
the
other
way
around
no
free
man
shall
ever
be
debarred
the
use
of
arms
the
strongest
reason
for
the
people
to
retain
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
as
a

how

there

acoustic

is
it
possible
to
mask
out
all
the
real

well
enough
so
that
none
of
it
strays
into
the
mouthpiece
perhaps
a
wellsealed
coupler
attachment
that
was
as
well
blocked
as
possible
then

subject
re

the
copsfeds
do
not
need
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
your
private
key
to
listen
in
to
cellular
conversations
encryption
is
not
endtoend
but
cellphone
to
basestation
it
has
to
be
this
way
so
that
cellular
users
and
fixed
installations
can
talk
to
each
other
for
cellular
to
cellular
calls
the
transmission
is
decrypted
at
the
basestation
passed
to
another
basestation
and
reencrypted
the
copsfeds
can
listen
to
the
unscrambled
call
provided
they
get
a
warrant
to
tap
into
the
cellular
providers
equipment
the
only
reason
for
wanting
a
crackable
system
is
so
they
can
listen
without
having
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
maybe
the
clipper
system
is
secure
and
they
really
do
need
a
warrant
to
get
the
key
out
of
escrow
before
they
can
listen
in
using
a
scanner
see
above
they
dont
have
to
go
down
this
route
anyway
i
have
my
doubts
but
even
if
true
once
they
have
the
key
they
will
never
again
need
a
warrant
to
tap
into
that
particular
phone
whenever
they
want
well
judge
it
appears
he
wasnt

all

naturally
well
stop
listening
in
that
was
true
for
the

paul

im
fairly
sure
theyre
talking
about
building
endtoend

rather
than

obviates

more
interestingly
we

no

what
the

no

why
this

restriction

if
it
not

provide
an

door
i
find
it
disturbing
that
at
the
very
best
my
security
is
dependant
on
approximately
bytes
worth
of
information
that
could
be
written
on
the
back
of
a

even
if
and
change
periodically
the
rationale
behind
this
restriction
in
the
size
of
the
keyspace
seems
strange
if
one
is
assuming
that
the
goal
is
security
and
makes
perfect
sense
if
the
goal
is
an
illusion
of
security
if
and
do
not
change
even
if
they
remain

i
wonder
if
they

somehow
be
backderived
given
enough

pairs
we
are
assured
that
this
cannot
happen
but
no
one
understands
how
skipjack
works
outside
of
government
officials
and
soon
foreign
intelligence
services
that
gain
the
information
via
espionage
presumably
we
will
eventually
have
the
information
as
well
reverse
engineering
gets
more
and
more
advanced
every
year
but
by
the
time
we
know
it
may
be
too
late
as
a
sequence
of
values
for

u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial

that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second

is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third

contains
the
unit

u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second

the
third

is
used
to
program
the

after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the

and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
none
of
this
makes
me
feel
the
least
bit
secure
the
silly
notion
of
destroying
the

appears
to
be
yet
another
bizarre
distraction
we
all

you
cant
read

turned
off
for
more

a

on

what
we
dont

is
why
there
is
a
need
to
generate
the
unit
keys
from
and
in
the
first
place
other
than
to
weaken
the
system
we
dont
know
if
the

in
question
would
resist
a
million
in
cash
a
piece
for
their

its
probably
worth
hundreds
of
million
so
you
can
make
the
bribe
arbitrarily
hard
to
resist

to
tell
you
the

the

slightly
so
that

the

the

the

what

the

can
you
while
my
mind
is
on
it
give
us
one
good
reason
that
the
algorithm
should
be
a
secret
algorithm
unless
this
encryption
scheme
either
is
a
joke
or
contains
features
like
a
master
key
or
other
back
door
for
unauthorized
eavesdropping
hmm
here
are
a
couple
if
the
algorithm
becomes
known
it
will
be
easy
to
produce
pincompatible
noncrippled
chips
that
provide
real
encryption
and
privacy
because
their
keys
are
only
in
their
users
hands
since
skipjack
is
a
symmetric
key
cypher
it
needs
some
way
to
agree
on
a
session
key
the
released
information
says
that
any
protocol
may
be
used
eg
dh
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
this
is
probably
true
however
from
a
practical
point
of
view
those
chips
must
have
some
kind
of
key
exchange
protocol
builtin
what
if
it
is
good
old
rsa
this
will
mean
that
the
producer
will
have
to
pay
lots
of
bucks
to
pkp
by
keeping
the
details
secret
this
can
be
avoided

just
a

as
a

of

arent
you
bound
by

to
gurantee
intelligble
access
to
the
data
of
the

on
the
bbs
if
police
comes
with
sufficent
authorisation
i
guessed
this
would
be
a
basic
condition
for
such
systems
i
did
run
a
bbs
some
time
ago
but
that
was
in
switzerland
the
us
doesnt
yet
have
many
laws
covering
bbss
theyre
not
common
carriers
theyre
not
phone
companies
theyre
just
private
machines
or
services
operated
by
businesses
theres
no
obligation
to
keep
records
as
perry
metzger
points
out
if
the
police
come
with
a
search
warrant
you
have
to
let
them
see
what
the
warrant
demands
if
it
exists
and
they
generally
can
confiscate
the
equipment
as
evidence
which
is
not
constitutionally
valid
but
were
only
beginning
to
develop
court
cases
supporting
us
a
court
may
be
able
to
compel
you
to
tell
them
information
you
know
such
as
the
encryption
password
for
the
disk
there
arent
any
definitive
cases
yet
since
its
a
new
situation
and
there
probably
arent
laws
specifically
covering
it
but
the
court
cant
force
you
to
know
the
keys
and
there
are
no
laws
preventing
you
from
allowing
your
users
to
have
their
own
keys
for
their
own
files
without
giving
them
to
you
even
in
areas
that
do
have
established
law
there
is
uncertainty
there
was
a
guy
in
idaho
a
few
years
ago
who
had
his
business
records
subpoenaed
as
evidence
for
taxes
or
some
other
businessrestriction
law
so
he
gave
the
court
the
records
which
were
in
hebrew
the
us
doesnt
have
laws
forcing
you
to
keep
your
records
in
english
and
these
were
the
originals
of
the
records
he
didnt
speak
hebrew
and
neither
did
anybody
in
the
court
organization
dont
think
they
were
able
to
do
much
about
it
it
might
be
illegal
for
your
bbs
to
deny
access
to
potential
customers
based
on
race
religion
national
origin
gender
or
sexual
preference
it
probably
hasnt
been
tested
in
court
but
it
seems
like
a
plausible
extension
of
antidiscrimination

there
may

another
reason
good
from
nsas

horrible
from
everyone
elses
why
the

might
be

first
note
that
the

will
only
look
at

and
of
just
the

in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
why
not
the

well
heres
the
possiblity
in
addition
to
encryption
the

preprocesses
voice
signals
to
make

the

once

and
if
this

indeed
the
case
think
of
the
possible

outcry
should
it

thus
the

it

hmmm
we
must
assume
that
generating

from

n
rather
than
generating
it
from
a
randomly
selected
and
is
an
intentional
way
of
assuring
a

the

u
is

n
if

do
not

they
constitute

along
with
f
the
theft
of

or
the
possession
of
which
by
various
authorities
completely
obviates
the

of

however
more
interestingly
we
know
for
a
fact
that
if
and
are
fixed
no
matter
what
the
keyspace
for
u
is
no
more
than
why
not
pick
and
at
random
why
this
interesting
restriction
of
they
key
space
if
it
not
to
provide
an
additional
back
door
i
find
it
disturbing
that
at
the
very
best
my
security
is
dependant
on
approximately
bytes
worth
of
information
that
could
be
written
on
the
back
of
a
napkin
even
if
and
change
periodically
the
rationale
behind
this
restriction
in
the
size
of
the
keyspace
seems
strange
if
one
is
assuming
that
the
goal
is
security
and
makes
perfect
sense
if
the
goal
is
an
illusion
of
security
if
and
do
not
change
even
if
they
remain
secret
i
wonder
if
they
can
somehow
be
backderived
given
enough
unit
keyserial
number
pairs
we
are
assured
that
this
cannot
happen
but
no
one
understands
how
skipjack
works
outside
of
government
officials
and
soon
foreign
intelligence
services
that
gain
the
information
via
espionage
presumably
we
will
eventually
have
the
information
as
well
reverse
engineering
gets
more
and
more
advanced
every
year
but
by
the
time
we
know
it
may
be
too
late
perhaps
the
trusted
escrow
agencies
can
be
the
ones
who
come
up
with
and
and
if
these
agencies
are
really
trusted
aclu
nra
is
an
interesting
example
we
can
hope
that
theyll
use
some
physical
process
to
come
up
with
truly
random
numbers
if
the
nsa
comes
up
with
the

thats
a
trap

a
nist
spokesman
acknowledged
that
the
national
security
agency
nsa
the
super
secret
military
intelligence
agency
had
actually
developed
the
encryption
technology
around
which
the
new
initiative
is
built
according
to
nist
the
technical
specifications
and
the
presidential
directive
establishing
the
plan
are
classified
to
open
the
initiative
to
public
review
and
debate
cpsr
today
filed
a
series
of
freedom

act
foia
requests
with
key
agencies
including
nsa
nist
the
national
security
council
and
the
fbi
for
information
relating
to
the
encryption
plan
the
cpsr
requests
are
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
the
computer
security
act
which
congress
passed
in
in
order
to
open
the
development
of
nonmilitary
computer
security
standards
to
public
scrutiny
and
to
limit
nsas
role
in
the
creation
of
such
standards
cpsr
previously
has
questioned
the
role
of
nsa
in
developing
the
socalled
digital
signature
standard
dss
a
communications
authentication
technology
that
nist
proposed
for
governmentwide
use
in
after
cpsr
sued
nist
in
a
foia
lawsuit
last
year
the
civilian
agency
disclosed
for
the
first
time
that
nsa
had
in
fact
developed
that
security
standard

legal
counsel
called
the
administrations
apparent
commitment
to
the
privacy
of
electronic
communications
as
reflected
in
todays
official
statement
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
he
questioned
the
propriety
of
nsas
role
in
the
process
and
the
apparent
secrecy
that
has
thus
far
shielded
the
development
process
from
public
scrutiny
at
a
time
when
we
are
moving
towards
the
development
of
a
new
information
infrastructure
it
is
vital
that
standards
designed
to
protect
personal
privacy
be
established
openly
and
with
full
public
participation
it
is
not
appropriate
for
nsa
an
agency
with
a
long
tradition
of
secrecy
and
opposition
to
effective
civilian
cryptography
to
play
a
leading
role
in
the

spoofing
clipper
serial

secrecy
in
clipper
chip
the
serial
number
of
the
clipper
chip
is
encrypted
with
the
system
key
and
transmitted
as
one
part
of
a
three
part
message
presumably
the
protocol
can
be
recovered

nothing

differential
analysis
postulate
if
you
will
a
chip
or
logic
sitting
between
the
clipper
chip
and
its
communications
channel
the
purpose
of
this
chip
is
twofold
transmit
channel
the
spoof
chip
xors
the
bit
encrypted
serial
number
with
a
secondary
keying
variable
this
renders
the
serial

unrecoverable

just
the
system
key
recieve
channel
the
spoof
chip
xors
the
incoming
encrypted
serial
number
with
a
secondary
keying
variable
assuming
the
serial
number
is
necessary
for
local
operation
this
has
the
net
result
of
hiding
the
serial
number
this
gets
more
interesting
when
the
number
of
serial
numbers
issued
becomes
large
making
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
valid
serial
numbers
and
a
spoofed
serial
number
without
knowing
the
system
key
you
could
lie
about
the
serial
number
but
risk
detection
of
the
lie
if
you
had
the
system
key
and
the
encryption
algorithm
you
could
successfully
lie
with
a
lower
probability
of
detection
by
emulating
the
format
of
your
own
serial
number
makes
you
wonder
whats
being
hidden

the

is

the

the

has

there
is

find

threatening

believe
that
someone
will
reverse
engineer
the
clipper
chip
and
knowlege
of
the
algorithm
will
likely
be
fairly
widespread
the
chip
and
algorithm
are
classified
if
you
reverse
engineer
it
and
tell
people
you
are
likely
to
go
to
jail
well
im
not
a
lawyer
but
from
what
i
can
tell
this
is
completely
and
utterly
untrue
you
see
this
country
has
this
thing
called
a
constitution
if
you
legitimately
aquire
the
device
and
you
yourself
are
not
a
government
employee
or
otherwise
encumbered
i
dont
think
they
can
stop
you
from
revealing
anything
about
the
device
you
can
determine
remember
the
pentagon
papers
precedent
the
first
amendment
applies
here
the
us
does
not
have
an
official
secrets
act
we
do
have
laws
that
will
punish
you
for
revealing
what
classified
information
you
learned
in
your
capacity
as
a
government
official
contractor
etc
and
we
have
laws
that
prohibit
stealing
such
information
however
if
they
sell
you
the
chip
i
cant
see
that
they
can
make
reverse
engineering
it
and
revealing
the
details
illegal

re

qas
on

chip
encryption
from
marc
vanheyningen
mvanheyncsindianaedu
the
majority
of
the
discussion
involving
this
clipper
chip
seems
to
pertain
to
the
encryption
of
telephone
conversations
does
anyone
know
if
that
means
this
chip
is
designed
to
work
primarily
with
analog
signals
the
language
sort
of
suggests
this
but
its
hard
to
say
id
lay
a
few
bucks
that
its
just
dataindataout
in
parallel
i
suspect
to
make
it
a
phone
youd
need
a
codec
and
speech
compression
there
would
be
a
loss
of
bandwidth
on
the
speech
signal
which
i
suspect
would
scupper
any
of
the
suggestions
ive
seen
here
about
putting
a
different
encryption
front
end
on
it
theres
no
hint
of
any
modulation
scheme
in
the
docs
im
sure
its
purely
a
digital
chip
the
back
end
will
come
later
but
im
positive
it
wont
be
left
to
the
manufacturers
they
all
have
to
be
the
same
modulation
scheme
to
make
it
easy
for
the
nsa
to
tap
them
the
only
other
possibility
is
that
this

the

can
you
call

get

before
too

it

archiving

i

nobody
seems

noticed

the

this

how
did
you
like

subject
another
key
registration
body
bites
the
dust
imho
one
of
the
candidates
that
has
been
suggested
for
a
key
registration
body
is
the
aclu
i
think
this
is
poor
choice
the
aclu
is
essentially
a
group
of
auditors
they
audit
how
peoples
civil
liberties
are
administered
traditionally
auditors
do
not
like
to
get
involved
in
the
design
or
operational
aspects
of
things
and
with
good
reason
when
i
was
a
systems
programmer
it
always
infuriated
me
that
the
auditors
would
come
in
and
tell
us
our
implementation
stunk
from
a
security
point
of
view
but
wouldnt
tell
us
how
to
fix
it
i
always
figured
they
just
liked
to
critcize
without
doing
the
work
to
help
fix
the
problem
then
i
took
a
stint
as
an
auditor
and
i
found
out
the
real
reason
auditors
dont
like
to
recommend
solutions
because
it
puts
them
in
a
bad
position
if
they
have
to
criticize
the
implementation
later
the
auditee
can
say
well
you
told
us
this
way
would
be
ok
it
compromises
the
independence
that
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
auditors
job
taking
the
case
at
hand
suppose
aclu
becomes
a
key
half
registrar
suppose
that
perhaps
through
some
error
on
aclus
part
a
key
half
gets
away
that
shouldnt
and
is
used
to
deprive
someone
of
her
civil
liberties
the
aclu
gets
wind
of
this
and
wants
to
take
it
to
court
but
they
end
up
being
at
the
same
time
on
the
side
of
the
defendant
and
of
the
plaintiff
which
is
not
an
easy
position
to
be
in
there
are
exceptions
to
the
complete
independence
of
auditors
at
one
place
where
i
worked
when
payroll
checks
were
printed
they
were
signed
automatically
by
a
signature
drum
on
the
bursting
machine
this
drum
was
kept
by
the
auditors
who
also
kept
the
check
stock
and
was
brought
down
to
data
processing
when
it
was
time
to
do
the
checks
i
believe
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
key
registration
situation
is
that
it
is
fairly
obvious
when
it
is
time
to
do
the
payroll
checks
if
they
were
done
yesterday
and
someone
wants
to
do
them
again
today
he
better
be
able
to
produce
yesterdays
checks
so
that
they
can
be
destroyed
determining
which
of
the
many
requests
for
key
halves
are
legit
is
a
trickier
process
one
much
more
prone
to
mistakes
that
could
put
the

in

how
many

how

how

in

how

what

what

the
question
im
asking
is
what
if
each

that

had
to
pay
for
it
being
charged
their
share
of
the
full
social
cost
of
forcing
communication
to
be
wiretap
compatible
would
they
choose
to
buy
such
wiretaps
or
would
they
find
it
more
costeffective
to
instead
investigate

finally
because
there
is
essentially
no
possibility
of
intercepting
in
realtime
the
scrutable
content
of
communications
between
stolen
instruments
there
will
exist
strong
motivation
to
record
and
archive
all
communications
in
the
network
for
expostfacto
scrutiny
once
some
criminal
act
is
discovered
and
the
instruments
involved
have
been
identified
it
seems
likely
to
me
that
that
a
large
subset
of
encrypted
communications
would
be
archived
to
tape
so
they
could
be
read
if
sometime
in
the
future
probable
cause
arises
and
a
warrant
is
obtained
i
can
even
imagine
this
being
found
legal
and
constitutional
since
nothing
is
actually
listened
to
until
a
valid
warrant
is
issued
and
the

are
obtained
imagine
archiving
all

conversations

if
someone
turns
out
to
be
a

dealer
you
can
listen
to
all
their
past

deals
and
archive

imagine

made

philosophy
worth

read
this

then
replace
prince
with

or
president
as
appropriate
and
read
it
again
from
chapter
xx
of
the
prince
by
n
macchiavelli
as
translated
by
daniel
donno
in
order
to
keep
their
lands
secure
some
princes
have
disarmed
their
subjects
others
have
prompted
division
within
the
cities
they
have
subjugated
some
have
nurtured
animosities
against
themselves
others
have
sought
to
win
the
approval
of
those
they
initially
distrusted
some
have
erected
fortresses
others
have
destroyed
them
now
although
it
is
impossible
to
set
down
definite
judgements
on
all
of
these
measures
without
considering
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
states
where
they
may
be
employed
i
shall
nevertheless
discuss
them
in
such
broad
terms
as
the
subject
itself
will
allow
to
begin
with
there
has
never
been
a
case
of
a
new
prince
disarming
his
subjects
indeed
whenever
he
found
them
disarmed
he
proceeded
to
arm
them
for
by
arming
your
subjects
you
make
their
arms
your
own
those
among
them
who
are
suspicious
become
loyal
while
those
who
are
already
loyal
remain
so
and
from
subjects
they
are
transformed
into
partisans
though
you
cannot
arm
them
all
nonetheless
you
increase
your
safety
among
those
you
leave
unarmed
by
extending
privileges
to
those
you
arm
your
different
treatment
of
the
two
categories
will
make
the
latter
feel
obligated
to
you
while
the
former
will
consider
it
proper
thoat
those
who
assume
added
duties
and
dangers
should
receive
advantages
when
you
disarm
your
subjects
however
you
offend
them
by
showing
that
either
from
cowardliness
or
from
lack
of
faith
you
distrust
them
and
either
conclusion
will
induce
them
to
hate
you
moreover
since
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
remain
unarmed
you
would
have
to
resort
to
mercenaries
whose
limitations
have
already
been
discussed
even
if
such
troops
were
good
however
they
could
never
be
good
enough
to
defend
you
from
powerful
enemies
and
doubtful
subjects
therefore
as
i
have
said
a
new
prince
in
a
newly
acquired
state
has
always
taken
measures
to
arm
his
subjects
and
history
is
full
of
examples
proving
that
this
is
so
but
when
a
prince
takes
posession
of
a
new
state
which
he
annexes
as
an
addition
to
his
original
domain
then
he
must
disarm
all
the
subjects
of
the
new
state
except
those
who
helped
him
to
acquire
it
and
these
as
time
and
occasion
permit
he
must
seek
to
render
soft
and
weak
he
must
arrange
matters
in
such
a
way
that
the
arms
of
the
entire
state
will
be
in
the
hands
of
soldiers
who
are
native
to
his
original
domain
and
since
the
subject
demands
it
i
will
not
fail
to
remind
any
prince
who
has
acquired
a
new
state
by
the
aid
of
its
inhabitants
that
he
soundly
consider
what
induced
them
to
assist
him
if
the
reason
is
not
natural
affection
for
him
but
rather
dissatisfaction
with
the
former
government
he
will
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
keep
them
friendly
for
it
will
be
impossible
to
please
them
if
he
will
carefully
think
the
matter
through
in
the
light
of
examples
drawn
from
ancient
and
modern
affairs
he
will
understand
why
it
is
much
easier
to
win
the
favor
of
those
who
were
happy
with
their
former
government
and
hence
were
his
enemies
than
to
keep
the
favor
of
those
who
out
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
former
rule
helped
him

seem

halfhearted
that
for

i
did
have
a
bunch
of
followups
going
on
about
cellularcordless

the
original
article
has
reappeared
so
the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
hmm
telephone
communications
could
indeed
include
endtoend
encryption
on
ordinary
landlines
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
but
the
next
paragraph
says
telecoms
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
ok
its
far
from
clear
exactly
what
cripple
what
an
apposite
anagram
will
be
applied
to
but
the
reason
joe
public
wants
secure
comms
is
to
stop
people
listening
in
to
his
cellular
or
cordless
phones
and
he
wouldnt
even
be
bothered
about
that
were
it
not
for
wingnut
and
squidqys
misfortunes
yes
cripple
might
be
for
endtoend
encyption
dropping
to
clear
when
the
other
end
doesnt
have
cripple
but
then
a
cordlesstoordinary
conversation
would
be
in
clear
leaving
the
cordless
end
just
as
vulnerable
as
at
present
nope
i
suspect
that
cripple
will
only
be
used
on
radio
links
ok
its
possible
telecommunications
networks
could
mean
ordinary
phone
lines
but
im
betting
it
means
the
microwave
links
used
by
the
telcos
my
apologies
if
im
wrong
particularly
if
the
turgid
press
release
makes
it
clear
that
im
wrong
and
i
missed
it
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
was
full
of
obfuscation
and
anyone
expecting
endtoend

is
in
for
a
surprise
imho

the
constitution
is
a
bunch
of
negative
things
things
the
government
cannot
do
all
rights
etc
not
epxressly
given
to
the
government
go
to
the
states
and
the
people
the
same
people
the
other
amendments
in
the
bill
of
rights
talk
about
since
i
am
sure
you
will
summarily
reject
my
interpretation
i
am
appending
a
linguistic
analysis
by
one
far
more
expert
than
myself
and
you
i
suspect
i
am
sure
you
will
find
his
qualifications
adequate
if
that
isnt
enough
i
can
send
you
the
senate
subcommitee
to
the
judiciary
on
the
constitution
report
on
the
same
thing
there
are
some
things
in
there
that
big
brother
types
like
biden
etc
must
have
really
had
to
swallow
hard
to
admit
i
think
you
will
find
that
people
that
seriously
study
the
constitution
and
state
what
it
means
will
say
the
same
thing
those
who
come
up
with
new
improved
meanings
are
those
who
are
trying
to
subvert
the
constitution
for
a
given
agenda
like
clinton
and
his
clinton
cripple
gun
control
people
control
and

control
and
the
whole
nasty
mess
please
tell
us
how
this
person
is
in
error
wont
you
and
please
back
it
up
with
some
proof
since
i
am
backing
my

up

if
you
wanted

all
about

youd
ring
up

if
you

about

the

to

would
be
norman

no
question
about
it
but
who
would
you
call
if
you
wanted
the
top
expert
on
american
usage
to
tell
you
the
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
that
was
the
question
i
asked
ac
brocki
editorial
coordinator
of
the
los
angeles
unified
school
district
and
formerly
senior
editor
at
houghton
mifflin
publishers
who
himself
had
been
recommended
to
me
as
the
foremost
expert
on
english
usage
in
the
los
angeles
school
system
mr
brocki
told
me
to
get
in
touch
with
roy
copperud
a
retired
professor
journalism
at
the
university
of
southern
california
and
the
author
of
american
usage
and
style
the
consensus
a
little
research
lent
support
to
brockis
opinion
of
professor
copperuds
expertise
roy
copperud
was
a
newspaper
writer
on
major
dailies
for
over
three
decades
before
embarking
on
a
a
distinguished
career
teaching
journalism
at
usc
since
copperud
has
been
writing
a
column
dealing
with
the
professional
aspects
of
journalism
for
editor
and
publisher
a
weekly
magazine
focusing
on
the
journalism
field
hes
on
the
usage
panel
of
the
american
heritage
dictionary
and
merriam
websters
usage
dictionary
frequently
cites
him
as
an
expert
copperuds
fifth
book
on

american
usage
and
style
the
consensus
has
been
in
continuous
print
from
van
nostrand
reinhold
since
and
is
the
winner
of
the
association
of
american
publishers
humanities
award
that
sounds
like
an
expert
to
me
after
a
brief
telephone
call
to
professor
copperud
in
which
i
introduced
myself
but
did
not
give
him
any
indication
of
why
i
was
interested
i
sent
the
following
letter
i
am
writing
you
to
ask
you
for
your
professional
opinion
as
an
expert
in
english
usage
to
analyze
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
extract
the
intent
from
the
text
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
is
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
for
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
the
debate
over
this
amendment
has
been
whether
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
is
a
restrictive
clause
or
a
subordinate
clause
with
respect
to
the
independent
clause
containing
the
subject
of
the
sentence
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
i
would
request
that
your
analysis
of
this
sentence
not
take
into
consideration
issues
of
political
impact
or
public
policy
but
be
restricted
entirely
to
a
linguistic
analysis
of
its
meaning
and
intent
further
since
your
professional
analysis
will
likely
become
part
of
litigation
regarding
the
consequences
of
the
second
amendment
i
ask
that
whatever
analysis
you
make
be
a
professional
opinion
that
you
would
be
willing
to
stand
behind
with
your
reputation
and
even
be
willing
to
testify
under
oath
to
support
if
necessary
my
letter
framed
several
questions
about
the
test
of
the
second
amendment
then
concluded
i
realize
that
i
am
asking
you
to
take
on
a
major
responsibility
and
task
with
this
letter
i
am
doing
so
because
as
a
citizen
i
believe
it
is
vitally
important
to
extract
the
actual
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
while
i
ask
that
your
analysis
not
be
affected
by
the
political
importance
of
its
results
i
ask
that
you
do
this
because
of
that
importance
after
several
more
letters
and
phone
calls
in
which
we
discussed
terms
for
his
doing
such
an
analysis
but
in
which
we
never
discussed
either
of
our
opinions
regarding
the
second
amendment
gun
control
or
any
other
political
subject
professor
copperud
sent
me
the
follow
analysis
into
which
i
have
inserted
my
questions
for
the
sake
of
clarity
copperud
the
words
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
contrary
to
the
interpretation
cited
in
your
letter
of
july
constitutes
a
present
participle
rather
than
a
clause
it
is
used
as
an
adjective
modifying
militia
which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
subject
the
right
verb
shall
the
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
asserted
as
an
essential
for
maintaining
a
militia
in
reply
to
your
numbered
questions
schulman
can
the
sentence
be
interpreted
to
grant
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
solely
to
a
wellregulated
militia
copperud
the
sentence
does
not
restrict
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
nor
does
it
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
elsewhere
or
by
others
than
the
people
it
simply
makes
a
positive
statement
with
respect
to
a
right
of
the
people
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
granted
by
the
words
of
the
second
amendment
or
does
the
second
amendment
assume
a
preexisting
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
merely
state
that
such
right
shall
not
be
infringed
copperud
the
right
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
its
existence
is
assumed
the
thrust
of
the
sentence
is
that
the
right
shall
be
preserved
inviolate
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
a
militia
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
conditioned
upon
whether
or
not
a
well
regulated
militia
is
in
fact
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
and
if
that
condition
is
not
existing
is
the
statement
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
null
and
void
copperud
no
such
condition
is
expressed
or
implied
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
not
said
by
the
amendment
to
depend
on
the
existence
of
a
militia
no
condition
is
stated
or
implied
as
to
the
relation
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
to
the
necessity
of
a
wellregulated
militia
as
a
requisite
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
deemed
unconditional
by
the
entire
sentence
schulman
does
the
clause
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
grant
a
right
to
the
government
to
place
conditions
on
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
or
is
such
right
deemed
unconditional
by
the
meaning
of
the
entire
sentence
copperud
the
right
is
assumed
to
exist
and
to
be
unconditional
as
previously
stated
it
is
invoked
here
specifically
for
the
sake
of
the
militia
schulman
which
of
the
following
does
the
phrase
wellregulated
militia
mean
wellequipped
wellorganized
welldrilled
welleducated
or
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
copperud
the
phrase
means
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
this
accords
with
the
desire
of
the
writers
for
civilian
control
over
the
military
schulman
if
at
all
possible
i
would
ask
you
to
take
account
the
changed
meanings
of
words
or
usage
since
that
sentence
was
written
years
ago
but
not
take
into
account
historical
interpretations
of
the
intents
of
the
authors
unless
those
issues
can
be
clearly
separated
copperud
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
meaning
of
words
or
in
usage
that
would
affect
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
if
it
were
written
today
it
might
be
put
since
a
wellregulated
militia
is
necessary
tot
he
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
abridged
schulman
as
a
scientific
control
on
this
analysis
i
would
also
appreciate
it
if
you
could
compare
your
analysis
of
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
following
sentence
a
wellschooled
electorate
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
shall
not
be
infringed
my
questions
for
the
usage
analysis
of
this
sentence
would
be
is
the
grammatical
structure
and
usage
of
this
sentence
and
the
way
the
words
modify
each
other
identical
to
the
second
amendments
sentence
and
could
this
sentence
be
interpreted
to
restrict
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
only
to
a
welleducated
electorate
for
example
registered
voters
with
a
highschool
diploma
copperud
your
scientific
control
sentence
precisely
parallels
the
amendment
in
grammatical
structure
there
is
nothing
in
your
sentence
that
either
indicates
or
implies
the
possibility
of
a
restricted
interpretation
professor
copperud
had
only
one
additional
comment
which
he
placed
in
his
cover
letter
with
wellknown
human
curiosity
i
made
some
speculative
efforts
to
decide
how
the
material
might
be
used
but
was
unable
to
reach
any
conclusion
so
now
we
have
been
told
by
one
of
the
top
experts
on
american
usage
what
many
knew
all
along
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
unconditionally
protects
the
peoples
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
forbidding
all
governments
formed
under
the
constitution
from
abridging
that
right
as
i
write
this
the
attempted
coup
against
constitutional
government
in
the
soviet
union
has
failed
apparently
because
the
will
of
the
people
in
that
part
of
the
world
to
be
free
from
capricious
tyranny
is
stronger
than
the
old
guards
desire
to
maintain
a
monopoly
on
dictatorial
power
and
here
in
the
united
states
elected
lawmakers
judges
and
appointed
officials
who
are
pledged
to
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
ignore
marginalize
or
prevaricate
about
the
second
amendment
routinely
american
citizens
are
put
in
american
prisons
for
carrying
arms
owning
arms
of
forbidden
sorts
or
failing
to
satisfy
bureaucratic
requirements
regarding
the
owning
and
carrying
of
firearms
all
of
which
is
an
abridgement
of
the
unconditional
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
even
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
staunch
defender
of
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
stands
by
and
does
nothing
it
seems
it
is
up
to
those
who
believe
in
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
to
preserve
that
right
no
one
else
will
no
one
else
can
will
we
beg
our
elected
representatives
not
to
take
away
our
rights
and
continue
regarding
them
as
representing
us
if
they
do
will
we
continue
obeying
judges
who
decide
that
the
second
amendment
doesnt
mean
what
it
says
it
means
but
means
whatever
they
say
it
means
in
their
orwellian
doublespeak
or
will
be
simply
keep
and
bear
the
arms
of
our
choice
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
promises
us
we
can
and
pledge
that
we
will
defend
that
promise
with
our
lives

since

why
is
not

american
entitled
as
a
matter
of
have
you
read
the
applicable
part

constitution
and
interpreted
it
in

yes
btw
the
appropriate
amendments
were
posted
here
some
time
ago
if
not
please
do
so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individual
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
its
ok
its
ok
just
a
month
ago
i
expressed
my
belief
that
the
right
to
have
a
means
to
shoot
your
neighbor
is
not
that
much
necessary
to
ensure
a
peoples
right
to
be
free
and
got
flamed
by
lots
of
american
gun
supporters
so
i
thought
that
never
mind
the
new
cripple
chip
is
a
purely
american
problem
so
deal
with
the
mess
yourselves
i
just
wanted
to
share
with
you
a
bit
of
my
experience
of
living
years
under
a
totalitarian
regime
im
bulgarian
because
i
thought
that
it
might
be
useful
to
you
oh
well
i
think
your
experiences
under
the
bulgarian
regime
are
highly
relevant
we
have
too
many
people
with
their
heads
in
the
sand
saying
it
cannot
happen
here
as
our
constitutional
rights
are
being
trashed
every
day
because
the
government
justifies
doing
some
endrun
around
the
protections
by
a
crisis
requiring
drastic
action
it
is
most
likely
that
in
the
future
possession
of
secure
encryption
tools
will
be
regarded
as
possession
of
terrorist
and
drug
dealers
tools
and
be
some
serious
fedaral
felony
just
like
common
tools
are
burgular
tools
if
the
police
say
so
common
computer
programs
even
computers
themselves
are
now
hackers
tools
and
will
become
terrorist
tools
bet
on
it
the
insights
of
someone
who
has
lived
throught
this
are
very
important
if
the
us
goes
the
way
of
the
old
soviet
union
and
its
client
states
as
far
as
individual
rights
privacy
and
overall
freedom
are
concerned
the
rest
of
the
world
remember
new

not
be
far

only
a
few
years
please
keep
posting
anything
you
find
that
is
deficient
or
that
threatens
ones
rights
in
this
thing
for
example
a
conversation
between
a
suspect
and
a
lawyer
will
no
longer
be
private
from
big
brother
eavesdropping
political
dissent
allready
is
very
dangerous
in
this
country
all
it
takes
is
the
government
to
decide
that
enough
people
will
take
one
seriously
then
one
becomes
guilty
of
plotting
to
overthrow
the
government
by
illegal
means
the
phrase
illegal
means
is
defined
as
whatever
the
government
wants
it
to
be
defined
as
couple
this
with
clintons
pressing
for
a
smart
national
id
card
an
internal
passport
with
the
added
wrinkle
that
anything
about
you
and
your
past
can
be
put
on
it
and
you
can
only
take
the
governments
word
as
to
what
is

it

the

so
taking
the
wasnt
surprising
sure
so
she
was
probably
guilty
but
thats
not
good
enough
in
our
system
youre
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
force
a
suspect
to
confess
to
a
crime
no
matter
how
strongly
you
think
theyre
guilty
you
have
to
develop
your
evidence
independently
doing
otherwise
might
catch
a
few
more
crooks
but
only
at
the
cost
of
turning
the
clock
back
to
the
middle
ages
when
confessions
were
routinely
tortured
out
of
suspects
both
guilty
and
innocent
ok
i
should
have
read
the
thread
before
posting
my
own
i
would
just
add
to
phils
very
infomative
discussion
the
following
caveat
the
fifth
amendment
applies
only
in
crinial
cases
nor
shall
any
person
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
thus
if
the
father
sued
for
custody
of
the
children
the
case
would
be
civil
and
the
defendant
mother
would
not
have
fifth
amendment
protection
oddly
enough
her
refusal
to
give
information
in
a
civil
case
can
lead
to
criminal
contempt
charges
thus
landing
her
in
jail
the
interesting
part
of
all
this
is
that
in
a
murder
trial
the
woman
can
plead
the
fifth
as
to
the
location
of
the
childthis
is
routine
a
computer
crime
prosecution
thus
would
seem
to
be
fertile
ground
for
this
kind
of
defense
where
a
suit
by
a
party
injured
by
hackers
would
not
if
i
am
accused
for
example
of
sending

kiddie
porn
over

the

protect

if
i
am
accused
of

however
it
proabably

not

the

gained

actually
reading

it

prevent

if

illegally
instead
of

try
to
think
a
little
bit
ok
if
thats
way
too
difficult
to
you
here
are
some
hints
indeed
the
new
proposal
imposes
some
additional
burocratic
burden
on
the
local
police
if
they
badly
want
to
tape
the
magic
cookie
recipie
that
your

is
telling
you
on

so
guess
what
they
will
do
propose
that
the
new
technology
is
removed
or
implement
some
facilitations
of
course
you
wont
want
to
wait
until
they
get
the
approval
from
two
different
agencies
to
decrypt
the
conversation
between
two
child
molesters
because
meanwhile
those
two
child
molesters
might
be
conspiring
about
molesting
your
child
right
so
there
should
be
some
way
for
them
to
get
access
to
those
keys
quickly
right
like
they
could
have
a
copy
of
the
database
and
worry
about
a
warrant
later
i
perhaps
should
have
been
clearer
and
more
concise
in
my
post
but
thats
what
i
get
from
posting
at
am
the
central
point
i
made
is
that
localstate
police
agencies
attempting
to
play
by
the
rules
and
get
warrants
legit
escrowed
keys
etc
may
find
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
bureaucratic
inertia
and
agency
infighting
at
the
federal
level
i
disagree
that
this
would
assist
civil
liberties
by
hobbling
the
cowboy
cops
it
would
be
a
strong
incentive
as
vesselin
points
out
for
more
police
agencies
to
go
rogue
and
try
to
get
keys
through
more
efficient
but
less
constitutional
means
notice
what
the
release
said
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
the
clear
implication
is
that
there
are
legal
authorizations
other
than
a
court
order
just
how
leaky
are
these
and
who
knows
whats
in
those
pages
that
authorized
the
nsa
there
may
well
arise
a
black
market
of
sorts
within
police
agencies
in
which
keys
are
traded
furthermore
the
police
will
be
in
an
excellent
position
to
carry
out
this
kind
of
thing
without
being
caught
they
already
have
a
communication
infrastructure
with
secure
portions
there
are
a
few
laws
that
i
know
of
that
limit
citizens
rights
to
access
police
communications
or
use
the
information
they
get
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
prove
police
misuse
the
fact
that
you
have
such
evidence
may
itself
be
evidence
that
you
have
broken

other

william
gibson
must
be
loving
it
great
story
material
dont
think
itll
happen
well
consider
eg
the
michigan
state
police
generally
a
very
professional
organization
which
for
years
kept
red
files
on
thousands
of
suspected
commies
knowing
full
well
it
was
not
consititutional
the
standards
of
evidence
were
just
about
zero
people
were
in
the
file
because
they
happened
to
park
near
a
place
where
say
a
uschina
peoples
friendship
rally
was
happening
the
police
went
around
writing
down
license
plate
numbers
if
you
happened
to
be
visiting
a
friend
who
lived
near
the
meeting
place
well
the
state
police
wound
up
filing
you
as
a
subversive
they
were
eventually
found
out
and
a
court
ruled
against
carrying
on
any
more
such
nonsense
i
believe
thay
may
have
had
to
destroy
the
tapes
as
well
even
with
wellmeaning
cops
and
im
sure
there
are
many
there
will
be
strong
pressure
to
bend
the
constitutional
safeguards
we
dont
need
to
assume
corrupt
or
unbalanced
officers
it
will
all
be
in
the
interest
of
enforcing
sensible
laws
saving
lives

protecting

will

my

is
i

they

isnt

we
are

remember

the
size

they
spend
a

more

he
always
enjoyed

i
rather
suspect
that

is
a

more

than

was
it
the

got
the

from

information
for
those
who
choose
not
to
stay
in
the
dormitories
the
following
is
a
partial
list
of
hotels
in
the
area
those
who
choose
to
stay
off
campus
are
responsible
for
making
their
own
reservations
and
early
reservations
are
advised
since
august
is
a
popular
season
in
santa
barbara
note
that
goleta
is
closer
to
ucsb
than
santa
barbara
but
that
a
car
will
probably
be
required
to
travel
between
any
hotel
and
the
campus
all
prices
are
subject
to
change
prices
should
be
confirmed
by
calling
the
individual
hotels
directly
however
mention
when
you
are
making
your
reservation
and
in
several
of
the
hotels
listed
you
will
be
eligible
for
the
university
rate
which
can
be
significantly
less
than
the
normal
rates
we
are
not
able
to
block
rooms
in
these
hotels
so
please
make
reservations
as
early
as
possible
the
quality
of
the
hotels
range
from
rather
expensive
beachfront
resorts
to
basic

re

considered

in

bradoptilinkcom
brad
yearwood
writes
if
clipper
comes
to
cellular
phones
along
with
legal
proscriptions
against
using
other
cipher
systems
on
these
phones
a
new
and
potentially
dangerous
class
of
crime
is
created
aside
from
possession
of
terrorist
tools
unapproved
encryption
devices
or
programs
criminals
who
very
badly
want
inscrutable
tactical
communications
specifically
the
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
who
proponents
of
key
escrow
cite
as
threats
will
be
highly
motivated
to
steal
the
cipher
phone
of
a
legitimate
user
and
to
kill
this
person
or
hold
them
hostage
so
discovery
of
compromise
of
the
device
will
be
delayed
once
a
suitable
collection
of
devices
is
stolen
criminals
can
communicate
with
impunity
assuming
the
cipher
system
carries
no
trapdoors
apart
from
key
escrow
until
and
unless
the
compromise
is
discovered
by
some
other
means
because
lifeischeap
criminals
are
currently
willing
to
kill
people
to
steal
very
large
and
conspicuous
property
luxury
cars
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
they
will
be
willing
to
kill
people
to
steal
small
and
inconspicuous
property
a
cipher
cellular
phone
just
as
we
have
seen
in
the
past
with
blue
box
technology
and
in
the
present
with
modified
cellular
phones
we
can
expect
to
see
among
highstakes
criminals
a
lucrative
market
for
stolen
cipher
phones
which
can
be
used
for
a
few
days
the
highstakes
criminals
will
pay
the
lifeischeap
types
substantial
amounts
for
stolen
instruments
because
a
person
is
typically
discovered
as
missing
or
dead
in
a
few
days
a
stolen
instrument
will
be
usable
for
only
a
few
days
there
will
be
a
continuing
demand
for
fresh
phones
fresh
bodies
and
since
clinton
is
also
going
fullbore
to
deny
unconnected
citizens
the
means
to
defend
themselves
we
will
protect
you
is
good
enough
for
you
by
perverting
or
trashing
the
second
amendment
the
targeted
individuals
will
be
guaranteed
easy
prey
what
is
a
few
bodies
compared
to
the
greater
good
of
the
fed
being
able
to
defeat
a
citizens
security
with
impunity
you
dont
think
there
doesnt
exist
a
means
by
which
the
nsa
can
do
their
usual
eavesdropping
scanning
for
keywords
with
or
without
a
court
order
or
any
keys
do
you
if
so
i
got
some
great
florida
real
estate
you
might
be
interested
in
perhaps
the
idea
of
escrowed
keys
is
meant
to
divert
the
discussion
to
how
they
will
be
safeguarded
and
away
from
the
basic
fact
that
the
government
is
systematically
taking
away
our
right
to
privacy
to
be
secure
for
the
means
of
selfdefense
and
just
about
every
other
right
spelled
out
in
the
bill
of
rights
nawwww
they
are
the
government
trust
us
in
other
words
clipper
and
similar
systems
have
the
potential
to
turn
a
current
inconvenience
to
law
enforcement
into
a
direct
vicious
and
persistent
threat
to
the
general
public
what
is
more
important
to
the
government
law
enforcement
people
control
or
the
safety
of
the

the

issue

good

safer
the
places
that
are

also

actually
many
of

have
noted
this
we
have
noted
that
the
program
started
at
least
years
ago
that
the
contracts
with
vlsi
technology
and
microtoxin
were
let
at
least
months
ago
that
production
of
the
chips
is
well
underway
and
so
forth
nobody
i
know
has
claimed
clinton
intitiated
the
program
but
he
chose
to
go
ahead
with
it
perhaps
the
nsa
realised
that
noone
would
even
contemplate
falling
for
the
dualescrow
bluff
while
under
the
bush
administration
and
had
to
wait
for

the
key
question
is
whether
nonclipper
encryption
will
be
made
illegal
it
seems
pretty
obvious
that
it
will
be
made
illegal
if
very
loud
noise
is
not
made
about
this
immediately
to
congress
and
the
house
it
looks
like
the
worst
nightmares
raised
by
dorothy
dennings
proposals
are
coming
true
if
the
government
continues
on
this
course
i
imagine
that
we
will
see
strong
cryptography
made
illegal
encryption
programs
for
disk
files

email
as
well
as

only

people
will
have
to
learn
how
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
are
protecting
their
privacy
i
dont
know
whats
worse
the
waste
of
money
or
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
all
clintons
rhetoric
to
the
contrary
this
is
a
feeble
attempt
by
a
large
group
of
bored
intelligence
bureaucrats
to
justify
their
currently
useless
jobs
clinton
said
he
was
going
to
trim
the
fat
from
the
government
this
doesnt
look
very
dietetic
to
me
as
i
said
before
in
this
group
drug
dealing
and
terrorism
both
tend
to
be
international
crimes
which
are
not
going
to
cease
if
the
us
starts
to
regulate
encryption
the
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
will
simply
go
to
other
countries
to
communicate
their
plans
and
will
still
carry
them
out
here
andor
wherever
else
this
is
not
the
solution
to
the
problem
they
try
to
invent
a
new
problem
by
saying
we
need

as

im
sure
you
can
see
the
flaws
in
this
logic
if
the
naive
market
is
flooded
with
proprietary
but
weak
encryption
then
truly
strong
encryption
will
be
unable
to
compete
this
is
true
for
the
mass
market
but
not
for
those
who
need
strong
crypto
and
are
willing
to
pay
the
price
after
all
one
can
buy
strong
crypto
today
if
one
is
willing
to
spend
enough
thus
the
concern
is
not
economic
the
issue
most
worth
worrying
about
is
that
after
the
system
takes
hold
the
government
will
outlaw
other
systems
and
something
voluntary
will
become
the
only
system
available
that
is
a
political
not
an
economic
issue
as
a
separate
matter
you
may
be
making
an
implied
advocacy
for
cheap
secure
crypto
for
everyone
its
true
that
the
clipper
chip
would
probably
prevent
that
except
via
clipper
but
cheap
secure
crypto
for
everyone
is
a
political
discussion
not
an
economic
one
and
the
whole
point
of

is
to
resolve
that
political
policy

well
im

from
what
i
can
tell
this

completely

utterly
untrue
the

for

official

we
have

however
if
they
sell
you
the

i
cant
see
that
they
can
make
reverse

it
and
revealing
the

illegal
in
most
cases
information
you

by
properly
is
yours
to
use
as
you
wish

there
are
certainly
exceptions
if
you
write
a
paper
which
includes
sufficiently
detailed
information
on
how
to
build
a
nuclear

it
is

i
understand
the

nuclear

design
is
automatically
classified
even
if
you
do
the

yourself
i
believe
you
are
then
not
allowed
to
read
your

a
less
serious
example
if
you
tell
drivers
about
a

trap
they
are
about
to

you
can
be
fined
even
though
you
might
argue
that
you
broke
no

when
you
discovered
the

of

the
charge
is
interfering
with
a

which
is
quite
similar
what
you
would
be
doing
by
reverse

the

dont
tell

that
you
think
this
violates
the
constitution
find
some

many
people
would
not

by
the

that

the

authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
in
these
two
sections
the
phrases
or
other
legal
order
and
normally
a
court
order
imply
there
is
some
other
way
or
ways
of
doing
a
legal
wiretap
what
isare
these
how
do
they
affect
the
way
people
who
trust
the
system
of
court
orders
to
protect
them
feel
about
this
escrow
system
the
second
section
shows
the
sequence
of
events
the
law
enforcer
armed
with
his
warrant
attaches
his
headphones
to
the
line
with
his
crocclips
remember
these
are
the
folk
who
couldnt
cope
with
digital
telephony
and
hears
a
load
of
modemlike
tones
we
are
talking
analogue
telephony
here
what
next
what
modulation
scheme
do
these
clipper
boxes
use
is
it
possible
to
record
the
tones
for
use
after
the
keys
are
obtained
i
thought
it
was
quite
difficult
to
record
a
modem
session
at
some
intermediate
point
on
the
line
maybe
they
have
taken
a
crash
course
in
data
comms
and
have
a
unit
that
demodulates
the
tones
and
stores
the
digital
stream
for
decryption
later
this
would
still
suffer
from
the
same
problems
as
trying
to
record
the
tones
as
the
demodulator
would
not
be
at
one
end
of
the
line
if
calls
cant
be
recorded
for
decryption
later
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
foil
the
system
by
buying
lots
of
clipper
units
these
are
supposed
to
be
cheap
mass
market
items
and
using
them
in
turn
how
tolerant
is
the
modulation
scheme
to
errors
these
things
are
proposed
for
use
by
us
corporations
to
secure
their
foreign
offices
where
phone
line
quality
may
well
be
poor
it
seems
hard
enough
to
me
to
get
digitised
speech
of
any
quality
into
something
a
modem
can
handle
without
having
to
add
lots
of
error
correction
to
keep
the
decryption
in
sync
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
this
raises
an
intersting
question
in
the
uk
here
it
is
illegal
to
connect
anything
to
a
public
telecomms
network
without
it
being
approved
by
a
body
called
babt
it
has
been
stated
either
here
or
in
the
uktelecom
group
that
they
will
not
approve
equipment
that
does
encryption
i
dont
know
if
this
is
true
or
not
but
this
would
make
a
good
test
case
perhaps
friendly
countries
and
the
uk
may
still
qualify

the

im

it

some

would

it
did

suppose
you
publish

spiffy

then

they

anything

though
you
cant

a

if
there
are
many
as
er
people
in
the
usa
who
reason
like
the
above
then
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
the
current
plot
has
been
allowed
to
happen
the
willingness
of
the
majority
of
the
people
to
give
up
their
freedom
in
exchange
for
a
sense
of
safety
is
hardly
limited
to
the
usa
and
is
an
endemic
problem
in
any
human
society
of
any
appreciable
size
the
structure
of
the
us
government
does
try
to
combat
this
tendency
to
some
extent
but
fighting
entropy
is
always
a
losing
battle
most
people
would
rather
have
comfort
than
freedom
the
paradox
is
that
you
cant
really
have
the
former
in
the
long
term
unless
you
have
the
latter
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
probably
come
across
to
some
people
as
a
weird
cross
between
a
libertarian
and
an
establishment
tool
is
that
i
end
up
taking
an
utterly
pragmatic
view
of
government
i
dont
get
up
in
arms
when
the
government
fails
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
people
because
in
my
lifetime
it
never
hastherefore
i
have
no
expectation
that
it
will
as
a
result
i
protect
my
own
interests
rather
than
expecting
the
government
to
be
fair
i
will
use
strong
cryptography
when
i
think
it
is
needed
whether
or
not
it
is
legal
at
the
time
same
thing
with
anything
else
the
government
would
rather
not
see
in
private
handsthats
their
problem
whats
important
to
me
is
using
the
right
tool
for
the
job
if
its
legal
so
much
the
better
if
it
is
not
but
does
not
violate
my
very
strong
sense
of
personal
ethics
i
will
use
it
anyway
as
long
i
think
it
is
worth
it
expecting
the
government
to
actually
protect
the
interests
of
its
citizens
except
by
accident
is
utter
folly
even
jefferson
one
of
the
major
architects
of
the
american
system
of
government
figured
that
in
a
couple
hundred
years
it
would
become
so
corrupt
and
selfserving
that
it
would
be
time
dismantle
it
and
try
again
by
revolution
if
necessary
i
agree
and
while
i
dont
go
around
trying
to
spark
one
ill
certainly
participate
if
it
happens
when
im
around
there
is
a
reason
i
am
such
a
strong
supporter
of
individual
rights
while
being
so
cynical
about
politics
ive
already
written
off

and
yes
this
may
get

andrew

andrew
but
paranoia
refers
to
unwarranted
or
excessive
suspicions
or
fear
not
those
that
have
reasonable
roots
lets
start
with
looking
at
the
professionals
the
nsa
itself
its
birth
was
by
secret
executive
order
by
harry
s
truman
in
until
even
not
even
one
word
of
this
executive
order
chartering
the
nsa
was
sealed
paranoia
right
on
the
outside
of
the
nsa
complex
is
a
ten
foot
cyclone
fence
with
multiple
rows
of
barbed
wire
with
high
voltage
complete
with
signs
prohibiting
even
making
sketches
under
penalty
of
the
internal
security
act
the
area
is
completely
scanned
by
closed
circuit
television
more
paranoia
these
are
professionals
maybe
they
know
something
we
dont
eh
do
you
think
it
would
have
helped
admiral
yamamoto
if
the
japanese
had
been
a
little
more
paranoid
of
their
purple
cipher
or
maybe
the
germans
should
have
been
a
little
more
paranoid
about
their
engima
with
respect
to
turing
and
the
british
how
about
the
cracking
of
the
zimmerman
telegram
would
a
little
more
paranoia
have
helped
the
germans
here
maybe
the
nsa
should
have
been
a
little
more
paranoid
about
emma
woikin
or
joseph
sidney
petersen
jr
or
maybe
you
want
to
talk
about
macmillan

cooperation
with
the
cia
and
nsa
to
suppress
yardleys
japanese
diplomatic
secrets
or
even
kahns

paranoia
right
the
most
popular
cipher
systems
in
captured
soviet
spies
was
the
onetime
pad
even
with
the
necessity
of
keeping
incriminating
evidence
about

known
to
be
the
only
proven
unbreakable

i
could
cite
probably
a

more
facts
which
all
support
as
best
hypothesis
the
notion
that
the

one
would
be
a

me

they

be

if
sometime
in

probable

arises
and
a

is
obtained
i
can
even
imagine
this
being

legal

constitutional
since
nothing
is
actually
listened
to
until
a
valid

is
issued
and
the

imagine
archiving
all

so
if

turns
out
to

you
can
listen

this

frightens

more
than

i

arent

slightly
overreacting
to

are
we
all

going

the
point

is
that
yes
this

it
is
not
the

guess
what

something
now
you
cant

in

were

you

where
a

what

how

the

diminish
the

maintaining

without
simply
saying
trust
the

they
wont
look
without
getting
into
the
really
thorny
questions
about
reverse

and
all
of
that
let
me
just
point
out
that
there
already
exist
gate
arrays
and
suchlike
that
have
whats
known
as
a
security
fuse
which
can
be
programmed
after
youve
verified
all
other
programming
this
makes
it
impossible
to
read
out
the
programming
of
the
device
again
ignoring
the
reverse
engineering
questions
speaking
from
experience
here
i
had
to
completely
reinvent
one
of
my
designs
some
six
or
seven
years
ago
when
the
disk
file
was
zapped
the
backups
were
all
bad
and
the
devices
were
unreadable
because
of
the
security
fuses
made
me
appreciate
the
value
of
printouts
so
on
this
point
at
least
theres
not
so
much
worry
but
whether
or
not
we
can
get
the
chips
made
reliably
and
securely
is
really
secondary
to
the
question
of
whether
use
of
the
chip
is
itself
likely
to
be
secure

the

chip
contains
a

algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with

has
rounds
of

with
for

supports

do
you

at

all
would
be
really
obnoxious
for
bandwidthlimited
applications
like
cellular

or
even
regular

over
how
do
the

interact
with
the
twopart

do
the
various
feedback
modes
only
apply
to
the
message
block
or
also
to
the
wiretap
block
or
if
the
wiretap
block
is
only
transmitted
at
the
beginning
does
it
get
incorporated
into
everything
through
feedback
modes
but
not
during
ecb
mode
does
the
clipper
chip
check
the
wiretap
block
itself
does
the
block
have
to
be
present
at
all
since
the
receiving
chip
doesnt
know
the
transmitters
u
it
presumably
cant
check
the
validity
of
eku
so
its
limited
to
checking
the
form
of
the
wiretap
block
and
maybe
checking
the
serial
number
for
reasonableness
unless
theres
some
sort
of
backdoor
structure
that
lets
it
recognize
a
valid
eku
in
that
case
can
you
replace
the
wiretap
block
with
a
different
wiretap
block
presumably
an
old
valid
one
to
avoid
attracting
attention
the
chip
wont
do
it
so
you
postprocess
the
output
regular
people
can
do
one
with
their
own
serial
number
and
a
dummy
key
paranoid
people
can
use
someone
elses
serial
number
on
the
other

if
i
could

the

intended

with
a

private

for

at

otherwises

starting
a

rather
than
just
maintaining
mailing

is
better
for
several
reasons
first
it
would
be
easier
to
archive

people
who
might
join
a

who
might

easily
read

posts
second
traffic
analysis
to
know

to
whom
an

message

would
be
foiled
three
a
newsgroup
is
much
more
public

would
serve
to
publicize
available
privacy
measures
on

and
it
would
be

the

does

if

lose
it
they
have
to
drill
out

this
is
a
time
consuming
and
expensive
process
which
they
will
be
happy
to

is
exactly
analogous
to

that
yes
this

it

guess
what

you

was

a

that

you
may
not
notice

as
an

i
notice

people
are
always
complaining
that
somebody
did

somebody
did

figure

new

as

i
spoke
today

company
mentioned
in

washington
times
article
about
the
clipper
chip
announcement
the
name
of
the
company
is
secure
communicatiions
technology
information
will
be
given
at
the
end
of
this
message
on
how
to
contact
them
basically
they
are
disturbed
about
the
announcement
for
many
reasons
that
we
are
more
specifically
however
mr
bryen
of
secure
communications
brought
to
light
many
points
that
might
interest
most
of
the
readers
his
belief
is
that
att
was
made
known
of
the
clipper
well
before
the
rest
of
the
industry
this
is
for
several
reasons
several
of
which
are
a
company
of
atts
size
could
never
be
able
to
make
a
decision
to
use
the
new
chip
on
the
same
day
it
was
announced
months
ago
they
proposed
using
their
own
chip
for
atts
secure
telephone
devices
att
basically
blew
them
off
as
being
not
interested
at
all
this
stuck
them
as
strange
until
now
also
i
spoke
with
art
melnick
their
cryptographer
he
expressed
several
concerns
over
the
new
clipper
chip
the
obvious
backdoor
will
be
able
to
let
many
people
decrypt
the
code
once
the
key
is
released
to
authorities
the
security
of
the
crypto
system
is
lost
forever
these
keys
can
end
up
in
the
hands
of
any
agency
of
the
government
the
fact
that
the
escrowed
keys
never
change
means
that
the
algorithm
is
vulnerable
over
time
to
an
attacker
the
classified
algorithm
may
hide
another
backdoor
but
he
feels
that
it
is
probably
to
keep
people
from
forging
fake
serial
numbers
or
changing
the
keys
themselves
additionally
he
feels
that
the
nsa
has
probably
spent
enough
time
and
money
in
working
on
a
way
to
keep
this
chip
from
being
reversed
engineered
that
he
feels
that
reverse
engineering
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
do
he
feels
that
they
have
developed
a
suitable
technique
to
protect
the
chip
from
this
attack
also
he
feels
that
the
chip
is
hardware
encoded
with
the
algorithm
and
not
microcoded
onto
the
chip
additonally
i
spoke
with
mr
melnick
about
their
algorithm
he
couldnt
tell
me
much
about
their
new
agorithm
because
it
hasnt
been
patented
yet
however
he
told
me
a
little
the
algorithm
will
be
released
for
public
review
after
patents
have
been
granted
for
it
this
is
so
the
crypto
community
can
see
that
it
is
secure
the
algorithm
is
called
nea
for
new
encryption
algorithm
the
details
were
sketchy
because
now
it
is
held
as
a
trade
secret
until
the
patent
was
issued
but
i
was
told
that
it
will
incorporate
the
following
it
will
have
fast
encryption
of
data
exact
specs
not
given
but
mr
melnick
stated
much
faster
than
what
an
can
put
out
it
is
a
symmetric
cipher
just
like
idea
and
des
it
will
use
bit
data
blocks
for
encryption
like
des
and
idea
the
key
length
was
not
given
to
me
but
mr
melnick
states
that
it
is
adujustable
and
is
more
than
adequate
for
security
the
algorithm
is
written
in
c
and
assembler
in
software
form
and
can
be
ported
to
many
platforms
unlike
the
the
clipper
chip
which
is
hardware
only
and
cannot
be
made
into
software
this
i
consider
a
definite
plus
for
the
nea
for
widespread
use
the
algorithm
will
accomodate
public
key
distribution
techniques
such
as
rsa
or
diffiehellman
this
will
also
be
supported
in
the
hardware
chip
right
now
the
projected
cost
of
the
nea
chip
will
be
about
dollars
for
each
clipper
will
run
each
chip
that
is
if
it
is
produced
enough
which
probably
wont
happen
they
currently
sell
a
program
called
ccom
that
uses
the
algorithm
and
a
special
streaming
protocol
that
does
not
divide
the
encrypted
data
into
blocks
this
could
prevent
plaintext
attacks
if
you
know
what
the
block
header
is
this
program
operates
at
all
supported
speeds
and
uses
the
software
implementation
of
the
algorithm
most
importantly
it
does
not
have
a
backdoor
right
now
the
company
is
afraid
that
the
new
clipper
chip
will
put
them
out
of
business
this
is
a
very
real
possibility
so
they
really
need
help
in
stopping
the
clipper
chip
from
becoming
a
standard

you

can
someone

if

i

note
i

i
might
have
completely

what
you
said
also
my
math
is
frequently
noted
for
being
wrong
so
youll
better
check
the
calculations
yourself
i
assume
that
means
bits
so
if
we
assume
one
start
and
one
stopbit
and
no
protocol
overhead
the
effective
number
of
bytes
per

is
lets
also
assume
that
you
do
not
want
to
transmit
your
speech
in
stereo
so
that
you
can
send
samplessec
this
corresponds
to
a
nyquist
frequency
of
hz
which
should
be
too
low
especially
if
you
think
about
the
low
quality
sound
furthermore
your
da
converter
will
probably
not
present
you
with
a
signal
that
has
been
cut
off
at
hz
but
will
instead
alias
in
all
the
higher
frequencies
although
you
can
definitely
build
a
filter
to
overcome
that
problem
on
the
other
hand
speech
should
be
easily
compressible
for
example
you
could
form
power
spectra
or
you
could
simply
bandpass
filter
and
then
linearize
the
fourier
transforms
it
wont
be
cd
quality
sound
but
itll
be
discernible
the
power
spectrum
method
is
very
good
in
that
respect
i
have
once
programmed
such
a
software
compressor
and
compression
rates
of
with

errors
due
to

what
about

also

whats

the

lets
assume
this
is
perfectly
ok
the
assumptions
you
make
are
big
ones
if
the
system
is
really
secure
then
why
does
the
government
have
to
keep
the
algorithm
secret
there
are
plenty
of
encryption
algorithms
that
dont
depend
upon
nondisclosure
to
be
secure
so
why
in
the
world
use
one
that
does
there
are
reasons
of
course
but
i
certainly
cant
think
of
any
honest
ones
next
you
assume
we
can
trust
the
escrow
houses
but
the
last
time
i
checked
every
single
branch
of

has
experienced
unauthorized
disclosure
corruption
and
even
fabrication
of
supposedly
secure

the
govt
is
saying
yeah
but
now
were
serious
so
you
can
trust
us
bullcrypt
and
finally
although
you
didnt
state
it
explicitly
you
implicitly
assume
that
the
warrant
mechanism
in
this
country
is
safe
and
reasonable
the
case
in
ventura
county
of
a
man
shot
and
killed
by
officers
serving
a
deliberately
fraudulant
warrant
tells
me
that
the
govt
has
a
long
ways
to
go
on
this
score
remember
that
all
this
is
to
catch
the

right
as
others

the

if

render

if

and
then
sold

private

has
a

the

early
flooding

likely
to
be

not

i
have
no

in

it

pure
conjecture
however
as
a
software
implementation
of
this

is
something
that
its

would
have
been
trying

avoid

then
the

seems
credible

this
is
not

exercise
performed

because
it
makes
you
think
about

decisions
made
by

i
could
speculate
that
these

using
tamperproof

unlikely
such
techniques
are
very
expensive
and
this

is
supposed

be
relatively
cheap
to
produce
or
that
there
will
be
some

framework

unlikely
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
arent
these
supposed
to
be
sold
internationally
i
suppose
that
the
most
likely
reason
the
algorythm
is
remaining
secret
for
the
moment
is
that
some
idiot
bureaucrat
untrammeled
by
the

of

decided

however
the

the

can

only

clipper

a

we

maybe
who

legal
well
people
know
even
less

strong

could
easily
be
labeled
too
much
secrecy
for
lawabiding
citizens
to

thats
not
for

though
only
the
federal

can
say
anything
about
the

anything
the

any

agency
says
is
opinion
at
best
what
they
say
is
opinion
but
what
they
do
is
what
matters
and
will
continue
unless
overturned
and
the
courts
are
reluctant
to
annul
law
or
regulation
going

some
length
to
decide
cases
on
other
grounds
furthermore
congress
can
get

quite
a

one
thing
that
clipper
offers
is
interoperability
at
a
higher
degree
of

than
we
currently
have
in
nonproprietary

encryption

this
means
it
will
be
cheaper
than
anyones

easier
to
probably
cheaper

you

if

otherwise
why
not
just
use

clinton

introduction
on
april
the

announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
together
the
federal
government
and
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
provide
secure
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
at
the
heart
of
the
plan
is
a
new
tamperproof
encryption
chip
called
the
clipper
chip
together
with
a
splitkey
approach
to
escrowing
keys
two
escrow
agencies
are
used
and
the
key
parts
from
both
are
needed
to
reconstruct
a
key
chip
contents
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
singlekey
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
takes
clock
ticks
and
in
electronic
codebook
ecb
mode
runs
at
mbits
per
second
each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
this
length
is
subject
to

u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages

the

they
are

will

to
see
how
the
chip
is
used
imagine
that
it
is
embedded
in
the
att
telephone
security
device
as
it
will
be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
an
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
this
key
negotiation
takes
place
without
the
clipper
chip
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
such
as
the
diffiehellman
publickey
distribution
method
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the
conversation
or
message
stream
m
digitized
voice
the
telephone
security
device
feeds
k
and

the

and
eek

chip
programming
and
escrow
all
clipper
chips
are
programmed
inside
a
scif
secure
compartmented
information
facility
which
is
essentially
a
vault
the
scif
contains
a
laptop
computer
and
equipment
to
program
the
chips
about
chips
are
programmed
during
a
single
session
the
scif
is
located
at
mykotronx
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
these
random
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
unit
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial
numbers
thus
the
unit
keys
are
a
function
of
secret
random
bits
where
each
agent
knows
only
to
generate
the
unit
key
for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce
and
and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to
and
the
second
bits
to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit
key
u
is
the
xor
of
and
and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
as
a
sequence
of
values
for
and
u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial
number
that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second
disk
is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third
disk
contains
the
unit
keys
u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second
disk
thus
each
agent
walks
away
knowing
an
seed
and
the
key
parts
however
the
agent
does
not
know
the
other
bits
used
to
generate
the
keys
or
the
other
key
parts
the
third
disk
is
used
to
program
the
chips
after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the
vault
and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
the
protocol
may
be
changed
slightly
so
that
four
people
are
in
the
room
instead
of
two
the
first
two
would
provide
the
seeds
and
and
the
second
two
the
escrow
agents
would
take
the
disks
back
to
the
escrow
agencies
the
escrow
agencies
have
as
yet
to
be
determined
but
they
will
not
be
the
nsa

fbi
or
any
other
law
enforcement
agency
one
or
both
may
be
independent
from
the
government
law
enforcement
use
when
law
enforcement
has
been
authorized
to
tap
an
encrypted
line
they
will
first
take
the
warrant
to
the
service
provider
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
communications
line
let
us
assume
that
the
tap
is
in
place
and
that
they
have
determined
that
the
line
is
encrypted
with
the
clipper
chip
the
law
enforcement
field
is
first
decrypted
with
the
family
key
f
giving
ek
u
n
documentation
certifying
that
a
tap
has
been
authorized
for
the
party
associated
with

n
is
then
sent
eg
via
secure

to
each
of
the
key
escrow
agents
who
return
eg
also
via

and
and
are
xored
together
to
produce
the

and
ek
u
is
decrypted
to
get

you
seem

be
assuming
that
all

are
of
equal
value
and
that
the
use
of
wiretaps
is
spread
uniformly
among
them
given
this
comparatively
tiny
number
of
wiretaps
and
the
associated
difficulty
and
cost
involved

i
expect
that
law
enforcement
reserves
the
use
of
wiretaps
for
the
most
valuable
cases
since
the
value
of
an
arrest
can
vary
over
an
enormous
range

re
secret
algorithm
re
clipper
chip
and
crypto
keyescrow
after
reading
the
debate
over
the
clipper
i
have
a
few
things
to
add
first
most
of
the
people
i
know
who
activly
use
encryption
privately
do
not
care
about
most
of
the
issues
that
surround
this
debate
and
any
questions
about
what
is
or
is
not
ok
to
use
in
the
us
all
they
care
about
is
wether
or
not
what
they
are
using
is
secure
or
not
that
after
all
is
the
bottom
line
second
if
i
look
at
all
the
people
i
know
who
use
any
form
of
encryption
at
all
and
this
group
spans
people
from
the
morons
who
still
insist
that
the
des
is
a
good
and
secure
standard
to
people
looking
at
trying
to
improve
upon
existing
strategies
i
can
not
think
of
anyone
of
them
who
would
approve
blindly
of
a
strategy
that
leaves
their
methods
open
to
abuse
the
clipper
does
this
because
people
make
mistakes
by
nature
and
the
us
government
is
made
up
of
people
who
are
just
as
vulnerable
to
mistakes
as
everyone
else
third
since
most
of
the
people
i
know
are
at
least
marginaly
familiar
with
the
vulnerabilities
present
in
current
software
encryption
stratigies
i
cant
see
how
most
of
them
are
going
to
blindly
trust
that
someone
will
not
figure
out
a
good
way
to
compromise
the
clipper
chip
that
despite
any
strengths
or
weaknesses
that
may
exist
in
it
so
i
can
not
see
a
high
degree
of
confidence
developing
in
the
chip
fourth
when
it
comes
to
criminal
abuse
sure
there
are
many
stupid
people
out
there
and
yes
some
will
be
open
to
being
caught
via
the
built
in
back
door
of
the
clipper
chip
however
anyone
who
is
going
to
do
any
serious
investigation
of
how
best
to
secure
their
data
is
going
to
run
into
that
problem
pretty
damned
fast
and
i
would
assume
start
looking
around
for
other
easily
obtainible
methods
of
encryption
if
nothing
else
were
avalible
none
of
this
would
be
an
issue
however
the
truth
is
that
most
private
encryption
users
that
ive
ever
run
into
simply
do
not
give
a
damn
about
the
legal
status
of
rsa
or
pgp
or
anything
else
if
it
works
they
use
it
this
is
not
going
to
change
either
i
do
not
think
for
a
moment
that
anyone
with
serious
criminal
intent
will
be
slowed
down
by
the
advent
of
the
clipper
chip
it
is
all
to
easy
to
convert
encrypted
data
into
unintellgible
garbage
as
it
is
if
anything
the
clipper
chip
just
adds
another
tool
to
the
user
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
people
will
use
what
works
and
unavoidibly
im
sure
most
criminals
would
rather
face
an
encryption
related
charge
than
one
which
could
potentialy
lead
to
death
penalty
charges
in
the
case
of
criminals
who
murder
as
part
of
their
conspiricy
the
other
thing
that
has
struck
me
since
the
advent
and
wide
useage
of
public
encryption
has
begun
is
that
quite
simply
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
or
if
you
have
an
interest
in
snooping
pandoras
box
has
been
opened
and
this

not
going

ive
seen
a
blindness
to
this
that
ive
found
utterly
stunning
and
the
clipper
chip
along
with
the
way
it
has
been
presented
only
confirms
this

subject
political
point
of
attack
clipper
infrastructure
my
earlier
argument
that
clipper
will
encourage
state
and
local
cops
to
commit
criminal
acts
is
largely
moot
now
that
weve
learned
that
the
fbi
will
perform
the
actual
tap
it
will
encourage
the
fbi
to
commit
even
more
criminal
acts
but
thats
not
the
point
here
but
this
gives
another
avenue
of
attack
on
the
clipper
proposal
when
the
effaclucpsr
foia
requests
are
made
they
should
ask
for
details
on
the
bureaucratic
and
equipment
infrastructure
that
is
proposed
or
even
already
budgeted
for
the
fbi
to
service
tapping
requests
for
now
and
the
projected
future
from
these
figures
estimate
the
number
of
clippertap
requests
the
fbi
is
expecting
publish
this
figure
compare
it
on
a
percapita
basis
with
the
amount
of
tapping
now
known
or
suspected
also
estimate
how
expensive
it
would
be
for
the
fbi
to
install
more
clippertapping
stations
and
how
rapidly
they
could
be
built
and
installed
ie
get
the
plus
or
minus
epsilon
for
the
near
future
might
be
a
mite
disturbing
for
j
q
public
to
know
these

despite
all
the

details
btw
thanks
to
those
whove
been

we
still
dont
know
how
the

requests
will
be

some

arised

which
i

will

be

perhaps
would
it
be
interesting
to
find
an

these
questions
the
clipper
chip
a
technical
summary
n
a
serial
number
this
length
is
subject
to
change
shorter
or
longer
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the
conversation
or
message
stream
m
digitized
voice
the
telephone
security
device
feeds
k
and
m
into
the
chip
to
produce
two
values
em
k
the
encrypted
message
stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a
law
enforcement
field
which
are
transmitted
over
the
telephone
line
the
law
enforcement
field
thus
contains
the
session
key
k
encrypted

the
unit
key
u
concatenated
with
the
serial

n
all
encrypted
under
the
family
key
f
the
law
enforcement
field
is
decrypted
by
law
enforcement
after
an
authorized
wiretap
has
been
installed
first
question
when
will
the
lawenforcmentfield
be
transmitted
and
how
does
the
remote
clipper
chip
handle
it
is
it
transmitted
periodically
in
the
stream
of
encrypted
blocks
or
just
at
the
beginning
does
the
phone
at
the
other
side
discard
those
packets
via
a
protocol
whatsoever
or
tries
it
to
turn
them
into
voiceoutput
which
would
not
be
disturbing
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
these
random
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
unit
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial
numbers
thus
the
unit
keys
are
a
function
of
secret
random
bits
where
each
agent
knows
only
second
question
why
why
is
such
a
strange
procedure
used
and
not
a
real
rng
this
turns
those
in
a
kind
of
bottleneck
for
system
security
when
law
enforcement
has
been
authorized
to
tap
an
encrypted
line
they
will
first
take
the
warrant
to
the
service
provider
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
communications
line
let
us
assume
that
the
tap
is
in
place
and
that
they
have
determined
that
the
line
is
encrypted
with
the
clipper
chip
the
law
enforcement
field
is
first
decrypted
with
the
family
key
f
giving
ek
u
n
documentation
certifying
that
a
tap
has
been
authorized
for
the
party
associated
with
serial
number
n
is
then
sent
eg
via
secure
fax
to
each
of
the
key
escrow
agents
who
return
eg
also
via
secure
fax
and
and
are
xored
together
to
produce
the
unit
key
u
and
ek
u
is
decrypted
to
get
the
session
key
k
finally
the
message
stream
is
decrypted
all
this
will
be
accomplished
through
a
special
black
box
decoder
so
no
technical
provision
will
be
taken
to
place
a
timeout
on
these
warrants
this
would
be
a
unique
possibility
to
realize
such
a
technical
restriction
by
letting
the
escrowagencies
perform
the
decoding
of
the
session
key
just
take
modemlines
instead
of
secure
fax
is
this
such
a
bad
idea
a
successor
to
the
clipper
chip
called
capstone
by
the
government
and
by
mykotronx
has
already
been
developed
it
will
include

when

it

note
that
these

to
be
constant

at

three

plus
the

wont

has

to

cryptography

everybody

strong
cryptography

bureacrats

we
dont

increasingly
hostile

a
serious

and
yet
the
people
vote
for
these
people
because
they
come
out
a
lie
to
them
about
promising
to
fix
things
the
administration
has
to
be
committed
to
leaving
private
industries
alone
esp
on
this
issue
the
government

no
legitimate

agencies

they
might

oh

no
such

can
be
constitutionally
sound
and
this
is
equivalent
to
a

threat
which
i
dont

this
kind
of
extortion
tends

agitate
me

i

perhaps
the

the

the

this
it
would
find
itself
impeached
for
reckless

outrageous
disregard
of
essential
established
entrenched

explicit
constitutional
privacy
guarantees
the

would
have
no
legal
standing
whatsoever
such
an
action
would
be
egregiously
illegal
and
criminal
and
wholly
untolerated

disregarded

unfortunately
the

misinformed
they
just

yet
this
is
an
outright
dingaling
denning
lie
the
two
aims
of
privacy
and
surveillance
are
intrinsically
and
fundamentally
incompatible
and
you
have
to
work
for
the
nsa
to
think
otherwise
americans
are
about
to
discover
ways
through
the
use

to
preserve
their
inalienable

forgotten
freedoms
that
have
slowly
been
eroded
away
by
an
increasingly

i
seriously

the

that

i
doubt
of
any

everybody

examine

led

i
think
youll
only
find
one
in

five
thousand
years
of

history
thats
not
very
good
odds
somebody
once
said
something
like
armed
violence
is
meant
only
to
be
used
in
response
to
an
armed
attack
it
is
not
meant
to
be
used
in
agression
this
is
the
difference
between
selfdefence
and
murder
lets
try

avoid

things
eh
theres
enough
blood
shed
in
the

without
adding
a

im

overreacting

of

at

what

it

it
seems
likely
to
me
that
that
a
large
subset
of
encrypted
communications
would
be
archived
to
tape
so
they
could
be
read
if
sometime
in
the
future
probable
cause
arises
and
a
warrant
is
obtained
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
data
like
this
could
be
used
in
court
currently
leas
can
install
wiretaps
on
large
numbers
of
phones
record
calls
without
listening
to
them
and
then
postfacto
obtain
warrants
and
listen
to
calls
after
probable
cause
is
established
but
this
strategy
wouldnt
get
the
stuff
admitted
in
court
at
least
not
in
the
near
term
in
other
words
near
as
i
can
tell
the
thing
that
makes
such
evidence
inadmissable
is
the
interception
without
a
warrant
not
the
attempt
to
interpret
what
was
intercepted
without
a
warrant
id
be
surprised
that
archiving
data
without
consent
would
be
interpreted
as
anything
but
analogous
to
a
wiretap
by
the
courts
note
that
that
doesnt
mean
i
think
it
wont
be
done
if
technically
feasible
just
as
im
sure
many
wiretaps
are
done
now
without
warrants
just
to
fish
for
avenues
to
investigate
so
in
the
future
start
surveilance
start
archiving
data
trump
up
some
probable
cause
decrypt
postfacto
after
the
warrant
is
in
hand
and
the
investigation
gets
a
boost
from
data

sadly
wont
ever
be

its

by

well
be

hey
this
is
nothing
new
we
already
have
cameras
in

and
teller

dont
we
and
then
well
pass
laws
requiring
cameras
covering
all
public
places
then
in
some
private
places
then
well
make
it
a
crime
ever
to

werent
especially
helpful
as
you

i
didnt

i
saw
people
on

trying

find
out
who
was
behind
clippercsrc
when
i
saw
peoples
names
posted
here
i
felt
it
was
time
to
clear
things
up
so
expn
and
vrfy
on
csrc
have
always
been
disabled
in
the
past
for
reasons
having
nothing
to
do
with
clipper
i
posted
the
white

announcements
at
the
request
of
policy
folks
here
because
csrc
also
provides
usenet
service
i
posted
them
from
an
account
called
clipper
i
also
created
an
alias
called
clipper
that
contains
the
addresses
of
members
of
the
nist
computer
security
privacy
and
advisory
board
set
up
under
law
of
the
computer
security
act
of
and
addresses
of
other
individuals
not
affiliated
with
nist
but
involved
in
cryptography
security
and
privacy
i
believe
that
these
individuals
were
included
on
this
list
because
nist
felt
it
important
to
get
them
the
clipper
information
firsthand
the
clipper
alias
is
there
for
the
benefit
of
those
named
above
it
is
not
a
source
for
information
it
was
set
up
solely
to
monitor
any
initial
traffic
individuals
on
the
list
have
requested
that
they
continue
to
get
traffic
that
is
not
already
duplicated
on
usenet
while
you
can
rightfully
say
we
were
a
bit
disorganized
in
handling
this
i
would
ask
that
people
stop
speculating
about
any
hidden
agendas
or
motives
of
the
individuals
on
the
clipper
alias
ive
already
apologized
to
them
for
whats
happened
disabling
expn
and
vrfy
is
an
increasingly
common
practice
albeit
unfriendly
to
some
and
any
effect
of
disabling
it
again
was

his

well

the

this
is
for
several
reasons
several
of
which
are
this
is
a
very
good
point
att
obviously
knew

participated
in
the
development
of

chip
this
amounts
to
unfair
business
practice
and
gives
att
an

on

hopefully
a
nonexistant
market
other
companies
that

motorola

have
grounds

a

over

right
now
the
company
is
afraid
that
the

will
put
them
out

this
is
a
very

so
they

it
would
seem
that
the
one
fact
that
the

has
overlooked
in
this
whole
fiasco
is
the
economic
standpoint
as
others
have
mentioned
the
most
difficulty
the
clipper
chip
faces
is
an
economic
one
lets
face
it
the
average
consumer
doesnt
care
or
know
that
the
clipper
is
a
bad
idea
if
there
is
a
perceived
need
for
cellular
encryption
then
the
companies
will
provide
one
most
likely
a
standard
will
emerge
but
if
the
clipper
is
too
expensive
and
a
chip
is
way
too
much
then
they
will
develope
their
own
or
buy
a
cheaper
one
i
give
sct
my
full
support
and
hope
the
clipper
chip
goes
the
way
of
the

also
hope

somebody
asked
me
what
was
wrong
about
overreacting
in
cases
such
as
this
the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a
new
civil
war
not
me
which
is
precisely
why
the
government
must
be
cut
off
at
the
knees
when
it
pulls
stunts
like
this
lest
the

worsen

re
key
registering

since
the
law
requires

branch
it
seems
clear
that
one
of
the
key
registering
bodies
should
be
under
the
control
of
the
judicial
branch
i
suggest
the
supreme
court
or
regionally
the
courts
of
appeal
more
specifically
the
offices
of
their
clerks
courts
already
operate
substantial
recordkeeping
operations
some
of
these
records
are
confidential
so
the
concept
of
a
court
holding
information
in
confidence
in
accordance
with
law
has
longstanding
legal
precedents
the
judiciary
is
more
immune
to
pressure
from
the
executive
branch
than
any
executive
branch
agency
or
contractor
can
be
so
judicial
control
of
keys
is
appropriate
for
the
other
half
of
the
key
i
suggest
a
unit
of
congress
the
general
accounting
office
the
gao
is
congresss
staff
unit
for
keeping
tabs
on
the
executive
branch
and
has
an
excellent
reputation
its
controlled
strictly
by
congress
the
executive
branch
has
no
authority
over
it
with
keys
split
between
the
legislative
and
judicial
branches
we
might
have
a
chance
of
this
system
working
honestly
if
of
course
a
way
can
be
found
to
keep
the
keys
from
being
siphoned
off
before
they
reach
the
repositories
this
should
not
be
construed
as
an
endorsement
by
me
of
the
whole
clipper
concept
but
if
we
have
to
have
it

branches

might

i
think
this
is
no
accident
it
comes
from
the
same
philosophy
that
the
government
rulescontrols
the
people
not
the
people
controlling
the
government
that
the
unconnected
citizens
are
not
sophisticated
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
them
so
the
government
must
tell
the
people
what
they
need
or
do
not
need
we
know
best
and
the
idea
that
that
a
commoner
can
defend
himself
against
government
eavesdropping
or
unlawful
attack
is
totally
unacceptable
to
people
with
this
outlook
combine
this
all
with
pushing
for
national
identity
cards
with
smart
chips
to
encode
anything
they
please
internal
passport
under
the
guise
of
streamlining
the

peoples
health
care
system
and
with
you
can
be
certain
more
jewels
yet
to
come
and
one
sees
an
extremely
ominous
trend
so
what
if
will
be
ten
years
late
it
still
is
turning
out
to
be
an
amazingly
accurate
prophecy
unless
a
lot
of
people
wake
up
and
in
a
hurry
one
should
always
have
every
red
warning
light
and
bell
and
danger
flag
come
up
when
the
government
seeks
to
set
itself
apart
in
regard
to
rights
etc
from
the
unconnectedunprivileged
citizen
or
should
we
now
be
saying
subject
instead
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
have
a
good
secure
system
of
data
security
not
dependent
on
nebulous
safeguards
for
maintaining
that
security
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
be
able
to
defend
himself
from
an
agency
gone
rogue
am
sure
the
feds
could
break
into
any
data
they
really
wanted
to
but
it
would
take
some
work
and
using
the
same
logic
one
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
good
safe
unless
a
duplicate
of
the
keys
or
combination
are
submitted
for
safekeeping
by
the
government
i
dont
really
see
a
difference
philosophically
encrypted
data
sure
wont
evaporate
not
with
such
hightech
tools
as
a
tape
recorder
the
average
amerikan
today
seems
to
think
that
the
government
should
be
able
to
eavesdrop
on
everyone
else
opinion
polls
show
that
most
people
belive
the
bill
of
rights
to
grant
too
much
freedom
to
people
when
it
is
not
identified
as
such
btw
if
anyone
knows
of
a
cite
for
that
id
love
to
have
it
not
only
does
this
mean
that
these
people
are
willing
to
give
up
everyone
elses
rights
they
dont
even
know
what
the
bill
of
rights
actually
says
how
can
we
show
the
average
person
not
the
average
usenet
reader
that
people
are
actually
entitiled
to
these
rights
so
many
people
dont
care
if
the

is
taking
more
and
more
control
of
us
all
a
little
at
a
time
if
there
was

these

from
the

chip
a
technical
summary
dorothy
denning
revised
april
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
singlekey
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
takes
clock
ticks
and
in
electronic
codebook
ecb
mode
runs
at
mbits
per
second
each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
this
length
is
subject
to
change
u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages
encrypted
with
the
chip
encrypting

the

to
see
how
the
chip
is
used
imagine
that
it
is
embedded
in
the
att
telephone
security
device
as
it
will
be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
an
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
this
key
negotiation
takes
place
without
the
clipper
chip
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
such
as
the
diffiehellman
publickey
distribution
method
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the

stream
m
digitized
voice
the
telephone
security

feeds

the

thus
contains

under
the

f
the

is
decrypted
by
law

after
an

been
installed
suppose
i
knew
how
the

worked
and
knew
the
n
for
my

but
did
not
know

then
by
cryptanalysis
i
might
be
able

determine
f
from

eek
u

suppose

either

i

be

if
i

i
can
also
defeat
the
law
enforcement
field
since
i
could
make
my
own

a
different

then
the
one
i
am
using
knowing
f
also
allows

analysis
to
be
performed
so
i
might
not
know
what
you
are
saying
but
i
could
know
who
you
are
saying
it
too
now
i
admit
that
someone
trying
to
compute
u
will
not
have
lots
of
messages
to
work
from
but
since
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
the

does
not
deliberately
generate

that
the

used
perhaps
the
us

be
chosen
from

for

obviously
the
compromise
of

would
be
a
disaster
both
to

enforcement
for

this
whole

for

the

the
most

the

an

the

if

a

if
the

a

much
then
they
will
develope
their

this
is
an

you
can
figure
that
the

the

the

i
suspect
cellular

this

adding

increase
the

all

who

it

be
nice
to
know
that
they

not

an

of
the

government
trusting
the
fox
to
guard
the
chickens
and
all
that
seems
suspicious
when
the
rest
of
the
sources
are
foxes
while
we
are
at
it
the
chip
designs
should
be
examined
and
verified
against
silicon
to
insure
no
trap
doors
or
hidden
protocols
exist
in
silicon
regardless
of
the
security
level
of
the
encryption
algorithm
it
would
be
a
shame
if
some
three
letter
agency
had
the
ability
to
interrogate
my
chip
when
all
id
know
is
that
someone
rang
and
when
i
attempted
to
go
off
hook
the
line
went
dead
could
be
even
worse
if
the
chip
were
intended
to
connect
directly
to
a
modem
the
design
examination
should
be
done
to
the
gate
level
does
anyone
have
a
good
idea
how
to
tell
if
there
is
a
piggyback
design
on
silicon
the
model
would
be
extra
logic
sharing
pins
with
the
advertised
function
tip
offs
would
be
circuitry
that
would
ignore
incoming
data
if
formats
or
sequence
is
not
right
i
can
think
of
only
two
ways
an
output
pin
could
be
used
and
its
possible
that
might
be
noticed
but
could
be
edited
from
the
netlist
i
think
the
silicon
itself
needs
to
be
investigated
imagine
a
design
done
in
two

metalization

finding
a

estimating

would
wiretap
chip
be
costeffective
by
robin
hanson
draft
april
summary
compared
to
an
average
monthly
phone
bill
of
sixty
dollars
wiretaps
are
only
worth
two
cents
a
month
to
police
so
the
proposed
wiretap
chip
must
raise
phone
costs
by
less
than
one
part
in
three
thousand
to
be
costeffective
background
until
now
phones
have
happened
to
allow
the
existence
of
wiretaps
detectors
which
could
pick
up
conversations
on
a
phone
line
and
over
time
law
enforcement
agencies
have
come
to
rely
on
this
capability
to
aid
in
criminal
investigations
however
powerful
new
encryption
technologies
threaten
this
status
quo
by
making
possible
truly
private
communication
a
small
chip
in
each
phone
could
soon
make
it
literally
impossible
to
overhear
a
conversation
without
physical
microphones
at
either
end
in
order
to
preserve
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
agencies
to
tap
phone
conversations
the
us
government
announced
on
april
that
it
had
developed
and
begun
manufacturing
a
special
wiretap
chip
to
be
placed
in
future
phones
instead
of
the
total
privacy
chips
which
have
been
under
private
development
the
same
day
att
announced
it
would
use
these
chips
in
all
its
secure
telephone
products
each
chip
would
be
created
under
government
supervision
when
it
would
be
given
a
fixed
indentifier
and
encryption
key
periodically
during
each
conversation
the
chip
would
broadcast
its
identifier
and
other
info
in
a
special
law
enforcement
block
law
enforcement
officers
with
a
court
order
could
then
obtain
the
key
corresponding
to
the
indentifier
from
special
trust
agencies
and
could
thereby
listen
in
on
any
future
or
previously
recorded
conversations
on
that
phone
to
date
most
concerns
voiced
about
this
plan
have
been
about
its
security
the
government
wont
disclose
the
encryption
algorithm
and
many
suspect
the
government
will
not
limit
its
access
in
the
way
it
has
claimed
the
track
record
of
previous
governments
does
not
inspire
confidence
on
this
point
however
this
paper
will
neglect
these
concerns
and
ask
instead
whether
this
new
wiretap
chip
is
a
costeffective
tool
for
police
investigation
that
is
which
is
a
cheaper
way
for
society
to
investigate
crime
force
phone
communications
to
support
wiretaps
or
give
police
agencies
more
money
to
investigate
crimes
in
other
ways
or
to
put
it
another
way
would
police
agencies
be
willing
to
pay
for
each
wiretap
if
they
had
to
pay
their
share
of
the
full
social
cost
of
forcing
phones
to
support
wiretaps
to
start
to
answer
this
question
we
might
compare
the
current
benefits
wiretaps
provide
to
law
enforcement
agencies
with
projected
costs
of
implementing
the
new
wiretap
chip
plan
and
since
current
benefits
are
easier
to
estimate
we
begin
there
wiretap
benefits
is
the
latest
year
for
which
wiretap
statistics
are
available
in
that
year
wiretap
installations
were
requested
and
no
requests
were
denied
this
figure
does
not
include
wiretaps
obtained
with
the
consent
of
a
party
to
the
conversation
arrests
resulted
from
wiretaps
started
the
same
year
arrests
came
from
wiretaps
in
previous
years
and
of
arrests
led
to
convictions
of
the
wiretaps
were
for
phones
vs
pagers
email
etc
were
regarding
drug
offenses
and
were
requested
by
federal
authorities
each
wiretap
installation
heard
an
average
of
calls
of
them
incriminating
among
people
and
cost
an
average
of
extrapolating
from
the
installations
reporting
costs
mostly
for
labor
thus
a
total
of
about
million
was
spent
on
wiretaps
to
obtain
about
arrests
at
per
arrest
thus
these
arrests
are
at
least
four
times
more
expensive
than
the
per
arrest
figure
one
gets
by
dividing
the
billion
spent
by
all
police
nationally
by
the
total
million
nontraffic
arrests
thus
the
million
per
year
spent
on
phone
taps
is
only
one
thousanth
of
the
total
police
expenditures
and
if
we
divide
this
by
the
million
phone
access
lines
in
the
country
we
get
about
cents
spent
per
year
per
phone
line
or
about
two
cents
a
month
in
general
we
deter
a
given
class
of
criminals
through
a
combination
of
a
perceived
probability
of
being
caught
and
convicted
and
some
expected
punishment
level
if
convicted
so
the
social
value
of
having
wiretaps
is
no
more
than
the
amount
that
we
would
have
to
pay
to
get
the
same
criminal
deterrence
through
other
means
if
unable
to
wiretap
a
particular
suspects
phone
police
might
instead
use
hidden
microphones
or
investigate
that
suspect
in
other
ways
or
police
might
focus
on
suspects
more
easily
investigated
without
wiretaps
or
we
might
raise
the
fine
or
prison
time
for
certain
types
of
crime
if
we
generously
assume
that
these
substitutes
for
wiretaps
would
be
on
average
twice
as
expensive
as
wiretaps
then
the
annual
social
benefit
of
phone
wiretaps
is
about
equal
to
the
current
spending
level
of
two
cents
a
month
per
phone
line
wiretap
costs
let
us
for
the
moment
optimistically
assume
that
the
us
government
encryption
scheme
is
as
secure
as
whatever
private
enterprise
would
have
offered
instead
protecting
our
conversations
from
the
spying
ears
of
neighbors
corporations
and
governments
both
foreign
and
domestic
even
so
the
need
to
support
wiretaps
would
add
many
additional
costs
to
build
and
maintain
our
communication
system
extra
law
enforcement
blocks
would
be
added
to
phone
transmissions
increasing
traffic
by
some
unknown
percentage
a
special
process
must
be
used
to
add
encryption
keys
to
chips
while
securely
distributing
these
keys
to
special
agencies
which
must
be
funded
and
monitored
the
chips
themselves
are
designed
by
a
military
contractor
whose
design
is
to
remain
secret
and
are
manufactured
through
a
special
process
so
that
the
chip
becomes
nearly
impossible
to
take
apart
chips
are
now
offered
at
the
relatively
high
price
of
a
peice
in
lots
of
private
encryption
systems
not
supporting
wiretaps
would
require
none
of
these
extra
costs
perhaps
most
important
government
degree
would
at
least
partially
replace
private
marketplace
evolution
of
standards
for
how
voice
is
to
be
represented
encrypted
and
exchanged
in
our
future
phones
it
is
widely
believed
that
governments
are
less
efficient
than
private
enterprise
in
procuring
products
and
standards
though
they
may
perhaps
perform
a
useful
brokering
role
when
we
choose
between
competing
private
standards
how
much
less
efficient
is
a
matter
of
debate
some
say
they
pay
twice
as
much
while
others
might
say
only
more
currently
a
total
of
billion
is
spent
as
operating
expenses
of
us
phone
companies
which
comes
out
to
about
per
month
per
access
line
if
we
compare
this
to
the
wiretap
value
of
two
cents
per
month
we
see
that
if
wiretaps
raise
average
operating
costs
by
even
as
much
as
one
part
in
then
wiretaps
are
not
cost
effective
and
this
doesnt
even
include
extra
costs
phone
owners
pay
because
their
encryption
chips
are
more
expensive
of
course
most
phones
wouldnt
have
encryption
chips
for
a
while
but
the
wiretap
benefit
per
phone
is
still
the
same
so
this
argument
still
applies
conclusion
given
this
dramatic
difference
between
the
total
cost
of
running
the
phone
system
and
the
value
of
wiretaps
we
can
justify
only
the
slightest
modification
of
the
phone
system
to
accommodate
wiretaps
when
the
only
modification
required
was
to
allow
investigators
in
to
attach
clips
to
phone
wires
wiretap
support
may
have
been
reasonable
but
when
we
consider
substantial
modification
the
burden
of
proof
is
clearly
on
those
proposing
such
modification
to
show
that
the
costs
would
really
be
less
than
the
benefits
if
consensus
cannot
be
obtain
on
this
costbenefit
estimate
a
compromise
might
be
to
tax
phones
which
do
not
support
wiretaps
at
a
rate
of
say
five
cents
per
month
a
tax
payable
to
police
agencies
nationwide
to
compensate
them
for
their
loss

but
were
talking
inexpensive
telephones
here
including
handsized
cellulars
that
need
strong
crypto
real
privacy
so
start
a
company
and
build
them
this
is
still
mostly
a
capitalist
economy
qualcomm
had
spare
cycles
in
the
dsps
for
their
new
cdma
digital
cellular
phones
they
wanted
to
put
strong
crypto
into
them
since
they
had
the
capacity
the
government
decided
to
discourage
them
really
none
of
this
stuff
is
especially
hard
all
you
need
for
a
true
private
phone
is
an
isdn
codec
a
vocoder
either
a
chip
or
software
an
encryptor
a
chip
is
fine
but
software
is
more
than
fast
enough
a
or
modem
module
and
maybe
a
microcontroller
to
run
the
whole
thing
its
easy
to
do
its
cheap
and
any
normal
company
trying
to
put
one
out
will
likely
get
a
visit
from
the

in

from
washington
just
like
qualcomm
did
i
suspect
that
companies
like
cylink
are
tolerated
because
their
products
are
too
expensive
however
no
law
yet
stops
one
from
building
really
private
phones
in
spite
of
the
hints
the
administration
has
made
when
discussing
the
new
crime
bill
and
in
connection
with
the
clipperskipjack
big
brother
chip
someone
out
there
will
build
a
unit
to
do
all
this
better
yet
prehaps
someone
will
produce
a
package
that
turns
any
box
with
a

over

i
noticed
a
rather
disturbing
trend
in
some
of
the
email

posts
ive
tossing
back
and
forth
me
too
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
some
people
to
hide
their
head
in
the
sand
the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a
new
civil
war
how
many
people
do
you
want
jailed
for
their
convictions
for
their
insistence
on
real
privacy
why
sit
by
quietly
while
the
preconditions
for
a
real
civil
war
are
put
in
place
by
a
shortsighted
government
everybody
is
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going

reach

the

mightier

the

can
people
work

it
examine
your
history
books
and
find
out
how
many
armed
revolutions
led
to
democratic
or
democratic
style
governments
i
think
youll
only
find
one
in
over
five
thousand
years

really
i
guess
you

the

revolution
how
about
england
india
mexico
france
holland
thats
not
very
good
odds
you
are
misinformed
but
this
whole

is
off
the
topic
somebody
once
said
something
like
armed
violence
is
meant
only
to
be
used
in
response
to
an
armed
attack
it
is
not
meant
to
be
used
in
agression
this
is
the
difference
between
selfdefence
and
murder
when
the

kick

tell
them
that
all

thoughts
and
questions
i
just
joined
this
group
recently
and
really
do
not
know
much
about
cryptography
but
a
couple
things
came
to
mind
while
reading
through
the
posts
is
the
clipper
chip
going
to
be
exported
if
not
how
will
people
communicate
with
other
countries
will
they
have
to
do
that
in
uncryptmode
will
other
encryption
techniques
be
legal
assuming
the
government
cracks
down
on
using
others
when
going
overseas
but
not
within
the
states
ive
read
about
authentication
systems
that
use
an
electronic
security
card
that
looks
like
a
calculator
to
create
an
encrypted
pin
based
on
the
timedate
the
host
system
has
the
algorithm
built
into
it
as
well
so
that
it
can
authenticate
a
user
is
there
some
form
of
encryption
technology
that
would
create
keys
that
are
only
valid
at
a
certain
instant
in
time
the
systems
would
then
allow
a
window
of
time
around
this
instant
where
the
key
would
work
i
realize
that
this
technique
would
increase
the
amount
of
information
needing
to
be
stored
because
you
would
need
entire
algorithms
rather
than
just
keys
but
for
smaller
scale
things
it
might
work
could
some
similar
method
be
used
to
make
the
two
keys
that
are
issued
to
policefbietc
to
tap
a
phone
only
usable
for
oneweek
for
instance
if
further
surveilance
was
needed
they
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
escrow
service
to
get
another
key
this
would
make
it
useless
for
local
police
to
database
keys
they
have
used
i
assume
this
is
not
possible
because
the
receiving
phone
would
need
to
be
able
to
decypher
the
message
but

thoughts

the

almost
the

without

suppose

i
may
now
be
able
to

again
theyre
betting
that
you
cant
find
u
given
k
ie
they
claim
the
encryption
is
strong
trust
us
i
am
not
willing
to
take
that
bet
if
i
know
f
i
can
also
defeat
the
law
enforcement
field
since
i
could
make
my
own
with
a
different
k
then
the
one
i
am
using
knowing
f
also
allows
traffic
analysis
to
be
performed
so
i
might
not
know
what
you
are
saying
but
i
could
know
who
you
are
saying
it
too
im
not
sure
therell
be
a
way
to
shove
arbitrary
key
and
data
through
your
chip
but
if
so
this
parts
ok
were
assuming
e
is
unknown
you
can
obviously
shove
arbitrary
data
through
your
chip
as
for
the
key
it
is
stated
that
the
sesion
key
exchange
is
external
to
the
chip
so
i
can
pick
my
keys
too
now
i
admit
that
someone
trying
to
compute
u
will
not
have
lots
of
messages
to
work
from
but
since
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
key
generation
method
does
not
deliberately
generate
weak
keys
or
for
that
matter
that
the
published
method
is
in
fact
used
perhaps
the
us
will
be
chosen
from
know
weak
keys
for
the
system
they
assume
that
you
wont
be
able
to
find
u
no
matter
how
many
messages
you
have
if
they
could
break
u
they
wouldnt
need
the
key
escrow
bing
bing
bing
bing
bing
that
exactly
my
point
since
we
cant
know
that
they
do
not
have
this
capability
the
only
safe
assumption
is
that
they
do
i
admit
that
most
of
my
cryptographic
complaints
are
probably
unfounded
but
since
we
cant
know
one
way
or
the
other
im
not
gonig
to
take
their
word
for
it
obviously
the
compromise
of
f
would
be
a
disaster
both
to
law
enforcement
for
whom
this
whole
thing
is
designed
and
for
the
people
who
believe
that
it
is
giving
them
security
f
is
but
one
number
and
i
sure
that
alot
of
people
more
then
know
what
it
is
and
if
some
panel
of
experts
is
going
to
check
it
over
for
flaws
then
many
more
will
know
f
forget
grinding
chips
bribery
and
blackmail
work
just
fine
its
not
clear
that
the
experts
will
be
told
f
in
fact
id
be
surprised
id
expect
something
more
of
the
form
of
the
fips

describing

that
they
could

while
seemingly
distrusting
that

i
have
a
couple
reasons
why
i
would
be
more
likely
to
trust
this

the
algorithm
will
be
made
totally
public
once
it
is
patented
the

will
not
be
escrowed
of

if
either
of
these
is
not
true
i
will
not
use
this

since
i
have
never
seen
this
new

i
have
no
idea
how
secure
it
is
yet
i
suppose
it
depends
on
how
paranoid
one
wishes
to
be
but
how
does
the

know
the

isnt

how
do
we

i
dont
suggest
that
but
post
this
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
class
of
speculation
that
has
no
more
truth
value
without
lots
of
hard
evidence
than
the
contrary
one
by
the
way
if
psionic
had
said
in
lower

letters
that
the

claims
there
was
no
back
door
id
have
no
problem
with
that
phrasing
i
cant
make
any
judgements
about
the

itself
yet
but
i
do
notice
that
the
creators
of
this

are
being
more
open
about
how
the
thing
works
and
is
willing

make

after

oh

the

ever
since
craig
rowland
posted
his
piece
new
encryption
to
scicrypt
there
has
been
some
discussion
of
our
company
secured
communications
technologies
inc
and
on
encryption
algorithm
nea
i
spoke
to
craig
at
length
on
and
we
covered
a
lot
of
ground
some
of
the
information
in
the
posting
requires
some
clarification
and
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
raised
on
scicrypt
sct
is
a
small
company
based
in
silver
spring
maryland
our
two
main
products
at
this
time
are
a
pc
based
secure
communications
program
called
secom
and
a
general
purpose
encryption
chip
which
uses
the
nea
algorithm
developed
for
secom
secom
provides
an
encrypted
secure
communication
link
between
two
pcs
connected
over
dial
up
telephone
lines
it
supports
simultaneous
bidirectional
file
transfer
and
keyboard
to
screen
chat
it
has
its
own
proprietary
communications
protocol
which
is
tightly
integrated
to
the
encryption
all
though
it
is
a
packetized
link
the
data
stream
appears
to
be
continuous
because
the
packet
boundaries
are
hidden
when
secom
was
initially
developed
it
was
implemented
to
use
des
encryption
a
business
decision
was
made
to
seek
export
approval
for
the
product
because
it
was
perceived
that
the
overseas
market
was
a
large
one
and
provided
a
good
marketing
opportunity
we
soon
found
out
that
we
would
never
be
granted
general
export
approval
for
anything
using
des
all
though
the
reason
for
this
was
never
explicitly
stated
it
seems
to
have
something
to
do
with
secret
government
to
government
agreements
which
are
still
in
effect
in
any
event
the
decision
was
made
to
develop
a
new
and
different
algorithm
which
would
take
the
place
of
des
this
was
the
reason
nea
new
encryption
algorithm
was
born
at
this
time
nea
is
being
held
as
a
trade
secret
the
preliminary
work
of
patenting
it
has
begun
and
the
plan
is
to
make
it
public
once
the
patent
process
is
complete
all
though
one
can
make
certain
legal
arguments
for
keeping
it
an
ongoing
secret
i
think
in
the
case
of
an
encryption
algorithm
it
is
necessary
to
let
people
shoot
at
it
over
an
extended
period
of
time
to
prove
its
worth
in
order
to
get
export
approval
for
secomnea
it
was
necessary
to
go
through
nsa
and
to
reveal
to
them
the
details
of
the
program
and
algorithm
this
was
done
only
after
we
had
a
finished
product
to
submit
let
me
state
unequivocally
that
there
is
no
back
door
to
the
program
or
the
algorithm
secured
communications
technologies
is
a
closely
held
private
company
and
nsafbicianistwhatever
has
no
financial
interest
in
any
way
whatsoever
with
the
company
or
any
of
the
people
involved
from
a
practical
business
standpoint
we
are
interested
in
selling
chips
and
software
hopefully
in
large
quantities
and
a
back
door
to
the
encryption
if
found
out
could
destroy
our
credibility
and
our
business
with
the
encryption
algorithm
approved
for
export
we
set
out
to
talk
to
a
number
of
potential
customers
for
encryption
products
and
systems
we
were
able
to
identify
several
common
threads
of
functionality
requirements
this
led
to
the
design
of
a
chip
with
the
encryption
algorithm
cast
in
silicon
and
certain
other
capabilities
added
so
that
the
chip
could
fulfill
the
broad
range
of
requirements
that
we
identified
we
are
strongly
opposed
to
the
clippercapstone
chips
in
a
press
release
today
our
president
dr
stephen
bryen
stated
it
seems
as
if
the
government
has
an
unlimited
source
of
funds
to
use
to
push
its
new
bugged
chips
on
the
american
public
but
do
we
not
understand
how
the
national
security
agency
which
is
not
supposed
to
be
involved
in
domestic
spying
can
fund
the
development
of
a
commercial
chip
intended
to
accommodate
us
government
domestic
spying
activities
if
they
had
asked
me
to
put

wanted
i
just
signed
up
for

so
i
hope
im
not
missing
something
in

but
im
looking
for
a
good
introduction
to
the
mathematics
of
encryption
particularly
des
and
publickey
though
others
would
be
interesting
also
probably
a
good
library
could
help
me
out
but
i
thought
it
might
be
even
easier
if
i
could
obtain
a
nice
article
entirely
electronically
besides
i
have
this
rather
rational
phobia
of
libraries
for
reasons
stemming
from
this
dissertation
thing
hanging
over
my
head
i
have
a
basic
knowledge
of
mathematics
numbertheory
is
a
bit
unfamiliar
to
me
but
ive
had
a
few
graduatelevel
math
courses
in
some
other
areas
anyway
im
not
a
complete
novice
to
the
field
so
probably
something
aimed
at
a
basic
graduate
introductory
level
would
be
about

andrew
ok
andrew
ill
provide
some
evidence
a
friend
of
mine
worked
for
an
electronics
manufacturer
on
with
a
westcoast
office
they
routinely
sold
equipment
to
the
japanese
one
day
the
japanese
started
showing
up
with
discount
demands
that
were
amazingly
close
to
the
cost
to
manufacture
the
products
this
company
routinely
sent
most
of
the
manufacturing
data
to
the
field
offices
the
japanese
had
simply
intercepted
it
so
my
friend
the
computer
systems
admin
came
up
with
a
solution
he
started
sending
the
data
out
doubleblockencrypted
with
des
two
days
after
this
new
distribution
plan
was
implemented
the
president
of
the
company
got
a
visit
from
a
pair
of
government
agents
they
told
him
to
knock
it
off
the
president
gave
in
since
his
company
did
a
considerable
business
with
the
federal
government
now
if
the
government
wasnt
monitoring
the
communications
how
would
they
even
know
that
the
encryption
system
was
installed
further
since
encryp
tion
isnt
illegal
and
des
certainly
isnt
what
is
the
basis
of
the
governments
ceaseanddesist
demand
the
spooks
do
whatever
they
think
is
necessary
with
or
without
the
blessings
of
the
law
ill
say
no
thanks
to
clipper
or
anything
else
the
government
produces
for
the
moment
double
or
triple
des
is
probably
adequate
and
when
the

is
idle
send
random
garbage
just

in
this

over
this
clipper

i
noticed
a
rather
disturbing
trend
in
some
of
the
email
and
posts
ive
tossing
back
and
forth
somebody
asked
me
what
was
wrong
about
overreacting
in
cases
such
as
this
the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a
new
civil
war
everybody
is
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going
to
reach
for
their
hammers
and
rifles
before
their
pens
and
paper
can
people
work
within
the
system
before
trying
to
break
it
a
circut
court
judge
in
illinois
once
said
when
dealing
with
a
government
that
seeks
continually
new
and
more
creative
ways
to
spy
on
its
citizenry
one
cannot
discourage
the
move
to
empower
the
common
citizen
with
the
means
to
parry
this
attack
on
personal
privacy
unfortunately
the
comment
was
with
regard
to
the
banning
of
radar
detectors
the
point
remains
more
and
more
i
see
the
government
slowly
washing
away
privacy
even
unwittingly
do
you
think
i
will
ever
live
in
a
soceity
that
issues
smart
cards
to
citizens
at
birth
do
you
think
i
will
live
in
a
soceity
that
insists
i
register
my
crypto
keys
so
they
can
keep
track
of
what
im
saying
even
if
there
is
no
evidence
of
my
guilt
do
you
think
i
will
ever
live
in
a
soceity
that
seeks
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
its
citizenry
without
recourse
of
any
kind
im
tired
of
it
there
is
imho
no
compromise
with
an
administration
that
seeks
to
implement
these
proposals
under
the
guise
of
enhancing
privacy
more
than
the
proposals
themselves
i
read
the
language
of
the
press
releases
the
obvious
deception
involved
in
presenting
these
pieces
to
the
public
and
i
am
sickened
i
am
revolted
i
am
repulsed
perhaps
even
of
this
country
could
care
less
about
the
clipper
chip
the
wiretap
bill
the
smart
card
because
they
are
so
entrapped
in
the
rhetoric
of
the
clinton
administration
this
saddens
and
frightens
me
i
am
a
conserveative
believe
it
or
not
a
law
and
order
conserveative
but
the
move
to
a
centralized
authoratarian
regime
really
scares
me
mostly
because
i
know
you
cant
go
far
wrong
underestimating
the
intelligence
of
the
american
people
tell
them
its
going
to
keep
them
safe
from
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
and
they
will
let
you
put
cameras
in
their
home
even
in
the
wake
of
waco
you
find
those
who
support
the
increasingly
totalatarian
moves
somebody
once
said
something
like
armed
violence
is
meant
only
to
be
used
in
response
to
an
armed
attack
it
is
not
meant
to
be
used
in
agression
this
is
the
difference
between
selfdefence
and
murder
to
be
quite
honest
the
way
things
are
going
id
call
it
self
defense
lets
try

avoid

things
eh
theres
enough
blood
shed
in
the
world
without
adding
a

of

etc
im
probably
overreacting

what

me
a

i
dont

you
see

in

i
have
seen
a
nonstop
stream
of

coming
out

that
at

appear
very
strongly
to
have
a

freedom
from

the

to
defend
ourselves

no

they

i
would

dead
if

is
to

able

or
is
that
no
longer
regarded
as
necessary
seeing
as
apparantly
the
people
have
no
input
on
this
agenda
the
administration
preferring
to
make
all
the
decisions
in
secret
then
springing
it
on
us
doesnt
sound
much
like
by
the
people
to
me
i
cannot
help
notice
that
the
congress
people
involved
were
not
mentioned
on
the
press
release
i
find
that
more
than
a
little
bit
curious
dont
you
i
sure
would
like
to
know
who
to
not
vote
for
come
election
time
yes
i
am
upset
i
feel
you
are
a
part
of
this
because
i
recall
it
was
you
that
was
posting
heavily
in
favor
of
a
very
similar
idea
could
have
been
the
same
thing
it
was
so
close
a
few
months
ago
i
also
recall
it
was
not
well
received
apparantly
powersthatbe
really
didnt
care
or
were
not
told
or
both
from
what
i
see
clipper
will
only
be
useful
for
conversations
i
dont
want
the
neighborhood
kid
listening
in
on
any
serious
security
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
trust
it
a
bit
might
as
well
use
cleartext
certainly
corporations
would
be
rather
dumb
to
depend
on
this
for
serious
tradesecret
data
especially
if
millions
depended
on
that
security
given
enough
money
one
could
buy
any
keys
they
wanted
buy
a
crooked
judge
and
a
crooked
cop
given
a
few
hundred
thou
they
wouldnt
be
hard
to
find
so
we
end
up
with
only
criminals
terrorists
and
the
government
with
real
security
and
the
ability
to
eavesdrop
you
know
the
first
two
if
they
are
serious
aint
going
to
use
this
thing
for
their
communications
i
bet
the
government
wont
either
except
perhaps
to
order
a
pizza
tell
us
will
that
be
prima
face
evidence
of
criminal
activity
someone
not
using
the

approved
methods
that
just
a
desire
to
have
privacy
is
no
longer
regarded
as
a
legitimate
right
of
an

that
be
grounds
for
a

of

there
will
be

to

on
the

have
yet
another
question
are
we
going
to
see
articles
in
all

magazines
consisting
of

text
telling
us
how
great
this
is
how
nice
the

is
by
letting

have
this
illusion
of

that
the

is
going

be
so
kind

sort

the

look

ways

attacking

require
three

formed
in

odd
way
where
do
the
constant

that

concatenated
with

come
from
are
they
changed

even
if
theyre

if

theres
no

but
why
allow

weird
format
if
those
three

then
maybe
its

to
ensure
that
a

cant

ok
andrew
ill
provide
some
evidence
a
friend
of
mine
worked
for
an
electronics
manufacturer
on
with
a
westcoast
office
they
routinely
sold

deleted
let
me
give
you
another
story
that
actually
happened
to
me
we
sell
communications
boards
that
use
a
they
used
to
be
high

our
agent
in
the
uk
sold
a
system
to
a
company
in
ch
which
packaged
it
in
a
product
for
cz
londonbernprague
i
telexed
the
brits
and
told
them
the
swiss
need
to
pass
export
paperwork
through
the
us
as
at
the
time
you
needed
an
export
lisence
for
these
systems
now
i
knew
the
nsa
was
watching
this
traffic
just
like
they
are
watching
this
traffic
and
what
do
you
know
two
weeks
later
an
agent
of
the
us
government
shows
up
in
my
office
to
remind
me
if
we
or
our
agents
sold
systems
into
the
evil
empire
we
had
better
make
sure
the
export
lisences
were
handled
properly

of
a
five
man
office
in
columbus
ohio
who
did
this

he
could
not
reveal
i
assume
most
of
the
time
these
guys
sat
around
the
office
with
their
thumbs
up
their
ass
as
there
isnt
that
much
stuff
coming
out
of
columbus
wow
the
electric
utility
in
prague
sure
is
a
big
worry
for
these
folks
the
point
is
we
have
created
a
giant
bureaucracy
nsa
with
a
budget
bigger
than
the
cias
who
like
all
bureaucracies
fill
their
time
looking
for
things
to
do
the
evil
empire
is
gone
the
nsa
is
not
they
will
do
something
to
fill
their
time
and
justify
their
budgets
i
just
wish
they
too
would
sit
around
with
their
thumbs
up
their
ass
but
that
is
too
much
to

for

i
think
there
are
many
practical
questions
that

especially
since
this

already

all
clipper
chips
are
programmed
inside
a

secure
compartmented
information
facility
which
is
essentially
a
vault
the
scif
contains
a

are
programmed
during
a
single

the
scif

at
the
beginning
of
a

a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
these
random
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
unit

a

how
long
does
all

a

mine
worked
for
an
electronics
manufacturer
on
with
a
westcoast
office
they
routinely
sold
equipment
to
the
japanese
one
day
the
japanese
started
showing
up
with
discount
demands
that
were
amazingly
close
to
the
cost
to
manufacture
the
products
this
company
routinely
sent
most
of
the
manufacturing
data
to
the
field
offices
the
japanese
had
simply
intercepted
it
so
my
friend
the
computer
systems
admin
came
up
with
a
solution
he
started
sending
the
data
out
doubleblockencrypted
with
des
two
days
after
this
new
distribution
plan
was
implemented
the
president
of
the
company
got
a
visit
from
a
pair
of
government
agents
they
told
him
to
knock
it
off
the
president
gave
in
since
his
company
did
a
considerable
business
with
the
federal
government
now
if
the
government
wasnt
monitoring
the
communications
how
would
they
even
know
that
the
encryption
system
was
installed
further
since
encryp
tion
isnt
illegal
and
des
certainly
isnt
what
is
the
basis
of
the

demand
something
similar
has
happened
to
me
ages
ago
when
we
were
working
on

we
used
to
send
short
messages
about
development
issues
or
simply
to
test
new
features
around
now
at
this

pgp
and
certainly
the
newer
version
was
unknown
over
here
suddenly
the
admin
at
the
site
i
was
using
received
a
request
that
i
stop
sending
encrypted
email
now
there
is
almost
no
way
that
some
automatic
scanner
could
have
found
this
since
they
wouldnt
have
known
about
pgp
they
must
have
checked
for
unknown
data
types
in
the
message
tried
to
unscramble
it
found
they
couldnt
get
past
the
pem
armour
part
and
then
contacted
the
sysadmin
and
asked
me
to
stop
luckily
the
current
email
carriers
are
less
picky
about
what
goes
over
their
networks
in
case
people
think
email
scanning
doesnt
take
place
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
done
regularly
by
many
sites
usually
not
by
government
agencies
or
at

not
that
i

more

not

i
believe
the

was
possible
because
of
the
amount
of

in
the

which
itself
constitutes
a

this

that
would

makes
two
things
obvious
cryptography
is
a
spontaneous
invention
of
private
human
individuals
and
has
been
going
on
for
thousands
of
years
teenage
slang
and
cipher
inventions
provide
a
modern
example
of
this
spontaneous
creation
the
systems
people
created
on
their
own
were
roughly
as
secure
as
and
sometimes
more
secure
than
those
used
by
military
and
diplomatic
users
of
that
time
although
they
seem
very
simple
and
insecure
today
eg
in
places
the
bible
used
a
more
complex
simple
substitution
than
caesar
did
for
his
military
dispatches

the

was

both
the

by
the
simple
expedient
fact
that
they
are
not

funded
or
overtly
controlled
by
the
government
thats
one
problem
that
has
so
far
been
overlooked
these
two
escrow
agencies
will
have
to
create
a
secure
database
and
service
the
input
and

who
pays
for
this
if
they
refuse

can
their
budget

to

will
congress
be

forever
the
problem
is
that
laws
can

congress
may
pass
a
law
setting
up
an

with
instructions
that

some

congress
may

that

suppose
prenazi
germany
had

do
you
think
the
escrow
agencies
would
have
told
hitler
that
he
could
not
have
the
keys
without
a
valid
court
order
in
effect
you
must
set
up
escrow
agencies
as
a
fourth
branch
of
the
goverment
and
isolate
them
from
any
outside
interferance
they
will
be

a
person
i
know
belonging
to
a
research
lab
of
a
rivate
company
claimed
to
me
during
a
priavte
conversation
that
given
the
equipment
in
his
lab
he
could
crack
a
kerberos
ticket
in
minutes
to
an
hour
he
had
access
to
rather
powerful
des
hardware
but
not
of
an
extraordinare
kind
i
believe
the
attack
was
possible
because
of
the
amount
of
known
plaintext
in
the
ticket
which
itself
constitutes
a
small
message
this
was
two
years
ago
des
is
no
longer
usable
for
encryption
of
really
sensitive
data
for
a
lot
of
purposes
however
it
is
still
very
adequate
this
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
a
passwordguesser
not
a
weakness
in
des
merritt
and
i
pointed
out
this
weakness
in
kerberos
in
a
paper
that
came
out
about
years
ago
in
both
computer
communications
review
and
usenix
for
that
matter
it
was
loudly
discussed
on
the
kerberos
mailing
list
even
earlier
the
problem
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
des
and
everything
to
do
with
bad
password
selection
im
perfectly
willing
to
believe
that
there
are
cryptanalytic
attacks
possible
on
des
im
quite
dubious
that
private
research
labs
know
them
and
the
parameters
of
a
bruteforce
attack
are
quite
well
established
see
for
example
the
garon
and
outerbridge
paper
in
the
july
cryptologia
youre
not
going
to
do
it
in
an
hour
with
only
rather
powerful
des
hardware
ill
leave
the
arithmetic
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
on
average
youll
need
to
do
trials
pick
your
own
parameters
for
how
fast
the

runs

i
hope
to
start
sending

back
and
forth
so
each
of
us
can
practice
cracking
them
i
would
like
to
start
with
simple
ceasers
ciphers
and
progress
roughly
according
to
david

book
of

i
would
be
interested

also

cut

slammed
me

nice
job
guys
ive
been
working
on
marijuana
legalization
for
over
years
now
clintons
actions
so
far
have
really
helped
but
because
of
government
action
taken
against
various
other
groups
i
have
developed
a
bit
des
based
on
public
literature
to
protect
my
mailing
list
the
sboxes
are
the
critical
component
and
since
i
chose
out
of
based
on
the
key
cracking
this
des
is
going
to
tough
the
reason
it
slows
you
down
a
touch
is
that
for
each
key
you
try
you
need
to
use
a
different
set
of
sboxes
i
know
its
only
a
vector
but
it
sure
makes
random
search
a
pain
several
marijuana
legalization
groups
have
had
their
mailing
lists
confiscated
when
people
were
charged
with
drug
usesales
its
not
a
crime
to
be
a
member
of
a
legalization
org
but
you
will
be
watched
it
really
is
important
to
write
a
letter
to
every
official
you
personally
vote
for
to
explain
why
your
privacy
is
being
destroyed
by
the
cripple
chip
amazingly
enough
they
do
listen
when
they
get
enough
mail
the
doonsbery
jokes
about
nra
postcards
are
real
and
the
imi
illinois
marijuana
initiative
has
grown
to
the
point
where
we
are
seeing
some
changes
its
pretty
clear
that
all
the
hullabaloo
is
really
about
the
implimentation
decision
being
made
behind
our
backs
as
vesselin
points
out
this
was
common
practice
in
communist
regimes
and
may
be
again
depending
on
how
the
vote
goes
but
just
as
criminals
have
guns
and
law
abiding
citizens
dont
and
criminals
like
me
have
marijuana
and
law

dont
criminals
like

will

while

dont
pgp
is
nice
but
as
time
goes
on
we
all
can
do
better
and
to
save
our
hides
we
will
someone
posted
an
excerpt
from
machiavelli
hes
my
favorite
dude
years
ago
he
saw
clearly
how
people
are
and
tried
to
explain
that
to
princes
who
wanted
people
to
obey
one
section
not
quoted
ive
got
the
prince
at
home
so
ill
just
paraphrase
had
to
do
with
conquring
a
free
city
the
only
way
is
to
completly
destroy
it
failing
that
you
must
appoint
locals
to
high
positions
and
accept
the
peoples
customs
even
after
years
of
oppression
a
people
will
remember
their
heratige
and
rise
up
to
overthrow
the
oppresive
government
and
he
gave
an
example
and
that
was
years
before
thomas
jefferson
there
were
questions
about
watching
traffic
only
interesting
traffic
is
watched
stuff
that
goes
overseas
and
comes
back
stuff
with
keywords
like
marijauana
cryptography
nsa
certain
individuals
who
are
known
subversives
etc
it
is
easy
enough
to
store
all
that
traffic
so
if
you
know
how
to
be
subversive
ie
how
to
be
unseen
its
pretty
easy
to
go
unnoticed
for
a
long
time
the
stronger
your
crypto
system
and
the
less
youre
noticed
the
better
your
chances
of
developing
an
organization
which
can
diseminate
truth
to
the
masses
which
gets
me
to
the
thread
about
a
public
encrypted
conference
thats
just
silly
the
first
thing
the

do
is
send

it

true

the

to
shove
the

not
the

as

down

throats
violates
the
principles
of
what
the
us
was
founded
on
but
the
government
is
full
of
idiotic
robots
called
bureaucrats

theres
less

suddenly
the

received

now
there
is
almost

tried

imagine

suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a

after
pushing
a

to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
an
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
this
key
negotiation
takes
place
without
the
clipper
chip
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
such
as
the
diffiehellman
publickey
distribution
method
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the
conversation
or

stream
m
digitized

the
telephone
security
device
feeds
k

stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a

field
which
are
transmitted
over

the

thus
contains

f
the

is
decrypted
by

after
an
authorized

been
installed
one
very
interesting
thing
i
notice
about
this
is
that
the
only
use
of
the
chip
key
is
to
encode
the
session
key
for
the
law
enforcement
field
it
is
not
used
at
all
by
the
encryption
algorithm
it
seems
like
it
would
be
possible
to
create
a
device
that
would
be
otherwise
compatible
but
would
send
out
a
bogus
law
enforcement
field
this
might
render
the
device
unusable
with
normal
devices
if
theres
some
sort
of
validation
involving
the
law
enforcement
field
but
it
could
certainly
be
used
with
other
such
modified
devices
of
course
this
is
irrelevant
if
the
nsa
has
a
backdoor
in
the
algorithm
but
it
does
make
it
possible

defeat

summary
responses
research
on
oracle
password
security
my
original
post
was
i
am
building
an
oracle
database
to
serve
as
a
repository
for
information
which
is
considered
proprietary
or
confidential
as
such
i
want
to
verify
the
security
of
oracle
passwords
and
apply
some
of
the
same
security
checking
techniques
we
use
on
our
nix
systems
specifically
i
would
like
to
use
crack
or
something
like
it
to
check
the
encrypted
data
for
easily
guessed
passwords
the
use
of
crack
would
depend
on
oracle
using
the
unix
password
encryption
scheme
does
anyone
know
if
this
is
the
case
or
what
method
is
used
any
other
methods
for
security
checking
audit
in
the
oracle
environment
would
be
much
appreciated
this
article
will
just
scratch
the
surface
of
a
few
security
considerations
comments
are
requested
email
fwworldstdcom
my
thanks
to
the
people
who
responded
both
on
usenet
and
from
oracle
corp
the
most
common
response
was
to
suggest
use
of
oracle
audit
features
or
ops
passwords
to
control
access
opinion
on
ops
included
suggestions
to
use
and
not
use
i
was
also
advised
to
use
table
views
to
refine
the
granularity
of
access
control
one
important
security
consideration
in
networked
installations
is
that
ops
accounts
presume
that
the
client
host
provides
user
authentication
server
ops
users
are
only
as
secure
as
the
least
secure
machine
on
the
network
hence
you
should
probably
not
define
any
ops
accounts
on
systems
with
pcs
or
limit
access
of
ops
accounts
to
data
with
no
security
concerns
unix
oracle
servers
provide
for
disabling
ops
access
over
the
network
orasrv
option
while
relying
on
host
security
for
local
processes
internally
oracle
provides
powerful
and
well
documented
sic
audit
mechanisms
which
the
dba
will
use
to
monitor
system
and
data
access
these
tools
can
be
used
to
track
the
primary
security
risks
from
within
the
oracle
environment
oracle
password
security
is
based
on
a
proprietary
usage
of
des
encryption
oracle
corp
states
that
the
algorithm
is
not
prone
to
cleartext
attack
this
is
a
difficult
claim
to
substantiate
since
the
algorithm
is
unknown
the
concern
here
is
that
if
users
choose
easily
guessed
passwords
if
a
cracker
can
gain
access
to
your
oracle
database
files
through
the
host
operating
system
she
could
extract
the
cyphertext
password
data
and
apply
cryptanalysis
techniques
to
learn
the
users
passwords
as
security
risks
go
the
above
scenario
is
pretty
low
severity
certainly
once
an
intruder
has
access
to
the
raw
database
files
she
can
access
to
the
data
in
them
if
a
cracker
could
break
the
passwords
however
she
could
do
substantial
damage
without
alerting
the
auditing
mechanisms
and
leaving
and
audit
trail
which
would
point
to
valid
users
at
present
oracle
like
unix
provides
no
native
means
of
ensuring
that
passwords
are
not
guessable
as
with
all
computer
security
the
most
important
defense
is
to
educate
users
in
the
safe
choice
of
passwords
these
techniques
are
well
discussed
in
internet
and
the
crack
manual
both
available
from
ftp
archive
servers
and
unixr

me
that
all
this
concern
over
the

a
little
overblown
what
cant
they

my
understanding
is
that
they
already
can

exc
to
our

bank

etc
again
well
they
cant
listen

since
i
already
use
cryptography
for
much
of
my
electronic
mail
and
will
start
using
it
for
my
telephony
as
soon
as
practical
however
allow
me
to
tell
a
parable
there
was
once
a
far
away
land
called
ruritania
and
in
ruritania
there
was
a
strange
phenonmenon
all
the
trees
that
grew
in
ruritainia
were
transparent
now
in
the
days
when
people
had
lived
in
mud
huts
this
had
not
been
a
problem
but
now
hightech
wood
technology
had
been
developed
and
in
the
new
age
of
wood
everyone
in
ruritania
found
that
their
homes
were
all
see
through
now
until
this
point
no
one
ever
thought
of
allowing
the
police
to
spy
on
someones
home
but
the
new
technology
made
this
tempting
this
being
a
civilized
country
however
warrants
were
required
to
use
binoculars
and
watch
someone
in
their
home
the
police
taking
advantage
of
this
would
get
warrants
to
use
binoculars
and
peer
in
to
see
what
was
going
on
occassionally
they
would
use
binoculars
without
a
warrant
but
everyone
pretended
that
this
didnt
happen
one
day
a
smart
man
invented
paint
and
if
you
painted
your
house
suddenly
the
police
couldnt
watch
all
your
actions
at
will
things
would
go
back
to
the
way
they
were
in
the
old
age
completely
private
indignant
the
state
decided
to
try
to
require
that
all
homes
have
video
cameras
installed
in
every
nook
and
cranny
after
all
they
said
with
this
new
development
crime
could
run
rampant
installing
video
cameras
doesnt
mean
that
the
police
get
any
new
capability
they
are
just
keeping
the
old
one
a
wise
man
pointed
out
that
citizens
were
not
obligated
to
make
the
lives
of
the
police
easy
that
the
police
had
survived
all
through
the
mud
hut
age
without
being
able
to
watch
the
citizens
at
will
and
that
ruritania
was
a
civilized
country
where
not
everything
that
was
expedient
was
permitted
for
instance
in
a
neighboring
country
it
had
been
discovered
that
torture
was
an
extremely
effective
way
to
solve
crimes
ruritania
had
banned
this
practice
in
spite
of
its
expedience
indeed
why
have
warrants
at
all
he
asked
if
we
are
interested
only
in
expedience
a
famous
paint
technologist
dorothy
quisling
intervened
however
she
noted
that
people
might
take
photographs
of
children
masturbating
should
the
new
paint
technology
be
widely
deployed
without
safeguards
and
the
law
was
passed
soon
it
was
discovered
that
some
citizens
would
cover
their
mouths
while
speaking
to
each
other
thus
preventing
the
police
from
reading
their
lips
through
the
video
cameras
this
had
to
be
prevented
the
police
said
after
all
it
was
preventing
them
from
conducting
their
lawful
surveilance
the
wise
man
pointed
out
that
the
police
had
never
before
been
allowed
to
listen
in
on
peoples
homes
but
dorothy
quisling
pointed
out
that
people
might
use
this
new
invention
of
covering
their
mouths
with
veils
to
discuss
the
kidnapping
and
mutilation
of
children
no
one
in
the
legislature
wanted
to
be
accused
of
being
in
favor
of
mutilating
children
but
then
again
no
one
wanted
to
interfere
in
peoples
rights
to
wear
what
they
liked
so
a
compromise
was
reached
whereby
all
homes
were
installed
with
microphones
in
each
room
to
accompany
the
video
cameras
the
wise
man
lamented
few
if
any
child
mutilations
had
ever
been
solved
by
the
old
lip
reading
technology
but
it
was
too
late
the
microphones
were
installed
everwhere
however
it
was
discovered
that
this
was
insufficient
to
prevent
citizens
from
hiding
information
from
the
authorities
because
some
of
them
would
cleverly
speak
in
languages
that
the
police
could
not
understand
a
new
law
was
proposed
to
force
all
citizens
to
speak
at
all
times
only
in
ruritanian
and
for
good
measure
to
require
that
they
speak
clearly
and
distinctly
near
the
microphones
after
all
dorothy
quisling
pointed
out
they
might
be
using
the
opportunity
to
speak
in
private
to
mask
terrorist
activities
terrorism
struck
terror
into
everyones
hearts
and
they
rejoiced
at
the
brulliance
of
this
new
law
meanwhile
the
wise
man
talked
one
evening
to
his
friends
on
how
all
of
this
was
making
a
sham
of
the
constitution
of
ruritania
of
which
all
ruritanians
were
proud
why
he
asked
are
we
obligated
to
sacrifice
all
our
freedom
and
privacy
to
make
the
lives
of
the
police
easier
there
isnt
any
real
evidence
that
this
makes
any
big
dent
in
crime
anyway
all
it
does
is
make
our
privacy
forfeit
to
the
state
however
the
wise
man
made
the
mistake
of
saying
this
as
the
law
required
in
ruritanian
clearly
and
distinctly
and
near
a
microphone
soon
the
newly
formed
ruritanian
secret
police
arrived
and
took
him
off
and
got
him
to
confess
by
torturing
him
torture
was
after
all
far
more
efficient
than
the
old
methods
and
had
been
recently
instituted
to
stop
the
recent
wave
of
people
thinking
obscene
thoughts
about
tomatoes
which
dorothy
quisling
noted
was
one
of
the
major
problems
of
the
new
age
of
plenty
and
joy

i

if
this

glad
to
you
are
correct
it
is
illegal
to
send
cryptographic
code
and
lots
of
other
things
out
of
the
country
without
a
license
however
every
us
citizen
has
a
general
export
license
allowing
export
of
lots
of
things
including
constitutionally
protected
speech
this
has
the
effect
that
it
is
legal
for
us
citizens
to
export
some
things
which
it
is
illegal
for
a
us
corporation
to
export
without
first
obtaining
a
license
dunno
if
youd
get
one
for
the
particular
code
you
have
the
only
way
to
find
out
is
to
apply
for
a
license
nope
talk
to
a
good
lawyer
in
the
area
of
export
law
but
in
general
the
government
has
to
have
a
very
good
national
security
case
to
try
prevent
the
export
of
anything
you
personally
might
wish
to
publish
yes
i
worded
that
the
way
i
did
intentionally
it
is
a
lot
easier
for
the
government
to
try
to
prevent
the
export
of
information
than
to
charge
someone
with
a
crime
after
the
fact
espionage
is
probably
the
only
exception
note
that
you
need
to
distinguish
between
what
is
legal
to
send
to
canada
if
you
have
such
a
license
and
what
is
legal
to
send
if
you
dont
if
you
are
a

you
have
a

i
am

slightly
overreacting

are
we
all

going

yes

it

you

were

you

what

you

in

where
a

i
have
about
the

pass
a

a

hasnt

that

of

there
are
still
problems
with
the

with
the

that
would
be
behind
an
attempt

it

but
this
would
be
a
way
for
those
in

of
allowing
continued

to
assure
us
that
it

only
be
used
in
cases
where

some
of
the

seem
to
reflect
the

one
will
have
to
hide

clipper

somehow
if

away
a
little
perspective
might
be
in
order
the
number
of
court

wire
taps
is
pretty
low
law
enforcement
has
to
present
pretty
good
evidence
to
get
even
that
limited
number
of
authorizations
thus
the
overwhelming
majority
of
conversations
are
neither
tapped
nor
recorded
by
the
government
and
for
that
to
happen
they
have
to
a
have
a
pretty
good
reason
with
evidence
b
use
this
sparingly
on
highest
priority
pretty
good
reasons
though
the
system
may
be
imperfect
it
is
a

read
about
the

about
j

or
about
the

of
martin
luther
king
then
after
he
has
digested
this
information
he
can
ponder
the
fact
that
while
the
government
does
not
tap
every
conversation
that
they
have
a
record
of
tapping
many
conversations
that
they
have
no
right

even
under

given
the
long
history
of

ignoring
the

it
is
no

that
so
many

sound

paranoid

given
the
fact
that
it

often
difficult

by

less

pseudocollision
work
to
the

of

not
evident
while
a
real

in

a
pseudocollision
or
a
pseudoinversion
a
pseudocollision
need
not
imply
a
real
collision
indeed
a
real
collision
since
it
involves
two
different
messages
would
almost
always
involve
em
different
message
blocks
and
such
that
but
the
pseudocollisions
have
the
same

blocks
moreover
the

and
would
generally
be
unrelated
but
the

den
boer

bosselaers
approach
to
anything
beyond
the
special
pseudocollisions
a
limitation
they
readily
admit
it
is
reasonable
therefore
to
believe
that
remains
secure
while
den
boer

have
found
interesting

seem
only
to
lead

anything

david
sternlight
brings
up
the
issue
of
how
the
escrow
agent
will
be
paid
and
the
fact
that
the
government
had
financial
leverage
if
they
dont
cooperate
its
an
important
issue
especially
if
one
of
the
escrow
agents
decides
theyd
rather
stop
offering
the
service
i
assume
that
if
the
escrow
agent
isnt
the
government
then
the
contract
for
providing
escrow
service
would
include
some
termination
clause
like
returning
the
keys
the
easiest
way
is
a
user
fee
for
each
clipper
chip
manufactured
this
makes
the
funding
separate
from
government
but
whos
the
user
paying
the
fees
here
and
whats
the
service
if
the
user
is
the
government
then
the
fundings
not
separate
from
the
government
if
the
user
is
the
buyer
whats
the
service
keeping
the
key
for
me
no
thanks
i
dont
need
and
wont
buy
their
service
not
telling
everybody
my
key
sounds
like
blackmail
if
the
user
is
the
manufacturer
does
the
user
have
a
choice
about
buying
the
alternative
is
to
just
generate
the
key
and
not
escrow
it
which
is
fine
id
certainly
pay
more
for
this
kind
of
key
than
an
escrowed
key
face
it
the
escrow
provider
is
providing
a
service
the
users
dont
want
the
only
people
who
want
it
are
the
government
not
the
users
what
youre
really
talking
about
is
either
the
government
paying
for
the
service
up
front
or
peryear
either
from
general
taxes
or
from
a
special
direct
tax
on
wiretap
chips
or
on
an
indirect
tax
forcing
the
manufacturer
to
pay
the
fee
to
the

i
hope
the
escrow
people
have
no
way
of
finding
out
your
name
from
your
serial
number
especially
if
the

is

here
in

we

there
are
people
willing
to
keep
your
store
from
burning
down
for
a
small
monthly
fee
though
sometimes
people
refuse
to
pay
and
discover
that
the

really
was
effective
if
you

the

them
shitless

the
trick
is
to
develop

define

damn
fast
allowing
anyone
who
feels
brave

inplement
custom

as
well
as
us
hacking
it

shouldnt
be
too
difficult
the
celp
stuff
is
standardised
we
use
tcpip
streams
and
a
protocol
allowing
silences
to
be
used
to
catch
up
on
any
net
lag
and
also
to
avoid
sending
any
data
during
silences
ie
its
not
wise
to
be
synchronised

on
each
end
because
any
net
delays
would
add

knowing

is
believed
by
many

here
to

no

more
details
will
emerge
so
the
loss
of
a

whether

guilty

may
mean
a

more
than
merely
replacing
the

saying

oh

a

the

if
made
mandatory
as

expect
will
make
such
storing

much
easier
i
fear
for
one
thing
the
transmission
of
the

field
acts
as
a
clear
signal
to
anyone
listening
a
kind
of
caller

on

also
the

companies
may
not
care
as
much
about
protecting
the
privacy
of
the

as
they
perceive
them
all
to
be
useless
encrypted
junk
this
is
a
bit
of
a
reach

will
restate
my
assumptions
more
explicitly
and
amplify
my
argument
the
original
title
perhaps
should
have
been
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
cipher
systems
considered
harmful
but
clipper
considered
harmful
is
not
inaccurate
and
is
more
eyecatching
in
the
current
context
assumptions
clipper
is
made
available
laws
are
passed
to
make
use
of
cipher
systems
other
than
clipper
illegal
either
on
radio
systems
or
on
any
common
carrier
system
these
laws
also
include
enforcement
authority
to
listen
across
the
relevant
radio
spectrum
or
other
medium
characterize
signals
validate
clipper
wrappers
detect
probable
use
of
nonclipper
ciphers
and
make
such
detection
a
cause
for
further
action
for
escrowed
keys
to
be
useful
some
specific
clipper
chip
must
be
associated
with
a
suspected
criminal
this
means
that
at
a
minimum
some
association
between
the
common
carriers
unique
phone
id
esn
and
the
clipper

serial

n
will
be
stored
in
a
government
database
an
observed
pairing
of
n
and
esn
other
than
the
one
recorded
raises
a
red
flag
to
reduce
ordinary
fraud
the
cellphone
system
which
offers
clipper
will
also
be
constructed
with
an
esn
mechanism
much
more
tamperproof
and
much
less
spoofable
than
todays
cellphones
criminals
want
inscrutable
communications
some
criminals
are
not
entirely
stupid
or
ignorant
and
will
figure
out
both
that
clipper
cellphones
offer
excellent
security
in
normal
circumstances
and
that
they
offer
no
security
against
law
enforcement
once
a
presumably
legitimate
wiretap
order
exists
they
will
also
figure
out
that
the
wiretap
order
must
necessarily
be
against
a
specific
cellphone
because
each
one
has
a
unique
unit
key
criminals
do
not
want
to
call
attention
to
themselves
because
they
are
not
stupid
or
ignorant
or
because
they
read
netnews
and
because
they
know
that
their
open
use
of
a
nonclipper
cipher
is
likely
to
be
detected
they
will
generally
avoid
using
nonclipper
ciphers
directly
on
some
monitorabletappable
channel
they
know
that
do
so
would
raise
a
red
flag
putting
a
given
cellphone
if
not
a
given
person
under
immediate
suspicion
it
is
impractical
to
reverse
engineer
skipjack
discover
family
key
f
and
construct
a
functional
clone
of
a
clipper
chip
by
and
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
spoof
a
given
clipper
phone
without
immediate
detection
because
it
is
difficult
to
obscure
ones
association
to
a
specific
phone
by
reprogramming
or
changing
chips
around
the
criminal
will
be
motivated
to
find
an
intact
phone
which
is
associated
with
someone
else
a
nonstupid
criminal
will
conclude
that
they
can
have
clippersecure
communications
at
least
for
some
limited
time
t
if
they
buy
beg
borrow
or
steal
use
of
someones
phone
in
a
way
that
prevents
that
person
from
reporting
compromise
of
the
phone
for
at
least
time
t
the
encrypted
communications
might
have
been
recorded
and
thus
be
retrievable
later
but
the
criminal
can
delay
and
quite
likely
evade
discovery
by
destroying
or
abandoning
the
phone
before
t
elapses
it
would
be
unusual
for
an
innocent
person
to
volunteer
use
of
their
clipper
phone
to
someone
else
the
honest
subscriber
doesnt
want
to
pay
someone
elses
bill
and
he
doesnt
want
to
fall
under
suspicion
this
leaves
two
sources
of
clipper
phones
for
criminal
use
coercion
and
collusion
coercion
first
theft
bears
a
relatively
low
risk
but
also
sometimes
a
low
time
until
detection
a
few
minutes
if
a
phone
is
stolen
from
a
car
parked
in
front
of
a
store
a
couple
of
weeks
if
a
phone
is
stolen
from
someone
who
is
away
on
vacation
criminal
commerce
is
likely
to
arise
in
stolen
clipper
phones
with
phones
coming
from
riskinured
poor
criminals
and
cash
coming
from
riskaverse
wealthy
criminals
someone
who
is
extraordinarily
motivated
to
gain
a
day
or
two
of
undetected
communication
like
a
terrorist
could
kill
a
person
or
hold
them
hostage
the
limited
time
before
detection
that
a
coerced
phone
is
useful
means
that
continuing
criminal
enterprises
require
a
continuing
supply
of
freshly
coerced
phones
there
would
also
be
created
a
collusive
commerce
between
relatively
wealthy
criminals
and
ignorant
or
dontcare
patsies
who
need
money
and
who
will
submit
to
being
paid
in
return
for
subscribing
to
clipper
phone
service
for
someone
elses
use
criminals
will
learn
that
it
is
more
to
their
advantage
to
coerce
use
of
a
clipper
cellphone
than
it
is
to
apply
a
nonclipper
cipher
to
a
normal
cellphone
they
will
call
much
less
attention
to
themselves
or
at
least
to
their
stolen
phone
this
way
the
fact
of
a
phones
use
being
coerced
must
first
be
reported
before
it
can
be
identified
as
an
interesting
phone
and
have
its
keys
obtained
from
escrow
clipper
also
allows
an
extraordinary
opportunity
for
the
criminal
to
conceal
use
of
superencryption
an
automated
fullsystem
surveillance
mechanism
quite
feasible
across
radio
bandwidth
which
knows
family
key
f
can
validate
clipper
wrappers
and
nesn
associations
but
it
cannot
reveal
in
realtime
the
use
of
superencryption
unless
it
knows
all
unit
keys
which
we
are
being
assured
are
only
to
be
made
available
in
two
separate
pieces
upon
specific
wiretaplike
order
whereas
a
criminals
use
of
any
cipher
within
a
normally
cleartext
medium
would
stand
out
a
criminals
use
of
a
nonclipper
cipher
within
a
clipper
medium
would
be
very
difficult
to
detect
even
ex
post
facto
in
bulk
recordings
as
long
as
the
association
between
criminal
and
specific
clipper
chip
is
fractured
if
you
make
use
of
this
other
cipher
illegal
per
se
then
you
can
charge
the
criminal
with
this
if
you
can
identify
the
true
criminal
hell
be
using
someone
elses
phone
but
youll
have
no
evidence
to
help
you
against
whatever
traditional
crime
he
might
have
been
planning
you
will
not
even
be
able
to
detect
that
unusual
encrypted
communications
are
occurring
until
you
identify
specific
phones
and
obtain
their
keys
from
escrow
the
gangster
and
terrorist
are
thus
arguably
more
not
less
secure
than
they
were
before
clipper
came
along
i
therefore
consider
clipper
harmful
because
it
does
not
provide
absolute
privacy
to
the
honest
public
against
aggressive
or
dishonest
government
if
other
ciphers
are
proscribed
it
engenders
new
types
of
direct
criminal
threat
to
the
honest
public
it
provides
an
extraordinarily
effective
mechanism
for
criminals
to
hide
their
use
of
some
other
cipher
making
it
more
difficult
than
ever
even
to
gain
notice
that
unusual
communications
are
occurring
and
that
plans
for
some
criminal
act
might
be
in
progress
if
other
ciphers
are
proscribed
lazy
investigators
and
prosecutors
are
more
likely
to
pursue
the
easily
quantifiable
cipheruse
crime
than
they
are
the
traditional
and
directly
harmful
crimes
which
key
escrow
is
claimed
to
help
against
if
other
ciphers
are
proscribed
the
stage
is
set
for
witch
hunting
of
illegal
cipher
use

re
do
we
need
the
clipper
for
cheap
security
there
are
chips
which
perform
the
voice
compressionexpansion
they
cant
be
expensive
because
they
exist
in
many
phones
connected
to
pbxs
or
on
the
pbx
line
cards
as
well
as
in
a
lot
of
equipment
which
compresses
voicegrade
circuits
to
save
the
cost
of
longdistance
leased
or
satellite
circuits
i
cant
remember
the
generic
term
for
these
chips
my
impression
is
that
this
was
a
big
deal
years
ago
but
circuits
have
gotten
so
cheap
that
it
isnt
done
much
now
codecs
they
have
to
get
about
compression
on

samples
to
squeeze
them
down
i
played
around
with
the
lossless

last
night
but
it
only
managed
ive
got
some
specimen

its
not
obvious
that
it
runs
in

i
think
its
just
proofof
concept
code
and
i
have
some
mucking
about
with
file
formats
to
do
before
i
can
put
my
own
sample
through
it
looks
like
the
current
option
is
to
use
a
voicemail
modem
with
builtin
dsp
chip
to
do
this
in
hardware
that
means
two
modems
for
a

putting
the
cost
at
upwards
ouch
maybe
soon
well
be

that
would
expend
the

to
use
a

to
avoid

linkage
does
not
in
my
opinion
make
big
brother
obsolete
but
acts
on
the
assumption
that
big
brother
is
ever
present
i
view
your
system
as
a
form
of
societal
paranoia
as
a
matter
of
principle
we
are
working
to
enact
formal
legal
protections
for
individual
privacy
rather
than
relying
on
technical
solutions
we
want
to
assume
a
society
of
law
which
respects
legal
limits
rather
than
a
society
that
will
disobey
the
law
requiring
citizens
to
depend
on
technical
solutions
eg
require
a
judical
warrant
for
government
interception
of
data
communications
rather
than
encrypt
all
messages
on
the
assumption
that
regardless
of
the
lawt
the
government
will
abuse
its
power
and
invade
privacy
as
a
matter
of
practicality
i
do
not
think
your
system
offers
much
hope
for
privacy
first
the
trend
toward
universal
identifiers
is
as
mucha
movement
generated
by
government
or
industrys
desire
to
keep
track
of
all
citizens
as
it
is
by
citizens
seeking
simplicity
and
convenience
in
all
transactions
at
best
your
system
would
benefit
the
sophisticated
and
most
would
opt
for
simplicity
the
poor
and
the
undereducated
would
never
use
or
benefit
from
it
finally
where
theres
a
will
theres
a
way
if
government
wants
to
link
data
bases
it
will
by
law
require
the
disclosure
of
various
individual
pseudonyms
used
by
citizens
or
prohibit
it
for
data
bases
which
the
government
wants
to
link
since
corporations
make
money
by
trading
commercial
lists
with
one
another
they
will
never
adopt
the
system
or
if
it
is
adopted
will
use
fine
printn
contracts
to
permit
selling
various
codes
used
by
their
customers
to
other
firms
the
solution
remains
law
policy
and
consensus
about
limits
on
government
or
corporate
intrusion
into
areas
of
individual
autonomy
technique
can
be
used
to
enforce
that
consensus
or
to
override
it
it
cannot
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
such
consensus

the

the

is
it
just
to
gain

to
defeat

if
so
why
use
bit

not
knowing
anything

its
not

possible
to
guess
whether
this
makes
it
harder
or
easier
to
guess
why

formed
as
they
are
it
would
be
facinating
to
see
the
skipjack
algorithm
to
look
for
ways
of
attacking
it
that
require
three
ciphertext
blocks
formed
in
that
odd
way
where
do
the
constant
values
that
are
concatenated
with
the
serial
number
to
form
come
from
are
they
changed
from
chip
to
chip
or
session
to
session
even
if
theyre
published
in
the
ny
times
if
skipjack
is
resistant
to
knownplaintext
attacks
when
using
triple
encryption
then
theres
no
break
in
security
but
why
allow
that
kind
of
weird
format
if
those
three
values
are
trulyrandom
bits
then
maybe
its
used
to
ensure
that
a
knownplaintext
attack
on
skipjack
if
it
exists
cant
be
easily
used
to
derive
and
for
a
whole
production
run
of
these
chips
i
cant
answer
all
our
questions
in
detail
but
i
can
take
a
stab
at
them
the
form
the
operations
that
compute
and
is
of
course
the
famous
triple
encryption
suggested
for
use
with
des
its
much
stronger
than
a
single
encryption
and
has
an
effective
key
length
of
bits
for
reasons
that
were
discussed
when
des
was
first
standardized
a
simple
double
encryption
would
not
have
the
same
strength
triple
encryption
has
been
used
by
ibm
since
more
or
less
the
beginning
to
encrypt
other
keys
its
recommended
for
anything
of
very
high
value
and
i
think
we
can
agree
that
the
ri
and
si
fit
that
description
why
and
well
you
need
different
plaintext
values
i
have
no
idea
if
theyll
be
disclosed
or
not
at
a
guess
theyre
constructed
so
that
they
differ
in
as
many
bit
positions
as
possible
a
goo
cryptosystem
will
scramble
things
a
lot
with
even
a
change
but
the
values
of
n
in
a
series
will
have
fairly
similar
bit
patterns
and
there
might
conceivably
be
a
weakness
so
the
ni
values
are
and
im
guessing
chosen
to
increase
the
hamming
distance
in
any
event
im
quite
convinced
that
one
cannot
go
back
to
the
si
from
the
ui
let
alone
u
observe
if
the
nsa
has
u
they
dont
need
to
find
si
but
even
if
they
do
they
cant
get
and
in
theory
they
should
never
even
see
those
values
even
with
a
warrant
the
real
question
i
think
is
why
use
this
scheme
at
all
as
opposed
to
a
hardware
random
number
generator
my
answer
is
that
this
is
much
more
verifiable
look
suppose
that
nsa
nist
the
aclu
the
eff
and
the
nra
combined
to
build
a
really
good
random
number
generator
and
that
it
passed
every
test
you
could
think
of
when
you
come
back
next
week
to
program
some
more
chips
does
it
still
work
that
well
have
any
components
changed
in
value
have
the
components
been
changed
out
from
under
you
does
it
still
work
well
the
in
the
presence
of
a
focused
microwave
beam
that
tends
to
bias
it
towards
selecting
bits
yes
you
can
run
detailed
statistical
tests
on
it
again
but
thats
hard
consider
on
the
other
hand
a
software
solution
you
bring
your
own
floppies
with
you
you
can
run
cryptographic
checksums
etc
its
a
lot
easier
to
verify
that
the
software
is
unchanged
in
other
words
yes
i
can
think
of
ways
to
cheat
software
too
i
think
that
theyre
a
lot
harder
there
are
three
issues
with
clipper
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
architecture
of
the
whole
scheme
is
capable
of
working
my
answer
with
one
significant
exception
is
yes
i
really
do
think
that
nsa
and
nist
have
designed
this
scheme
about
as
well
as
can
be
assuming
that
their
real
objectives
are
as
stated
to
permit
wiretapping
under
certain
carefullycontrolled
circumstances
with
a
minimum
risk
of
abuse
the
exception
is
that
u
exists
outside
of
the
chip
on
a
programming
diskette
thats
seriously
wrong
and
should
be
loaded
onto
the
chip
separately
to
those
who
disagree
and
i
dont
claim
my
answer
is
obvious
though
i
found
my
own
reasoning
sufficiently
persuasive
that
i
was
forced
to
rewrite
the
conclusions
section
of
my
technical
analysis
paper
i
had
originally
blasted
the
scheme
i
issue
this
invitation
assume
that
you
were
charged
with
implementing
such
a
system
with
complete
regard
for
civil
rights
and
due
process
what
would
you
do
differently
in
answering
this
question
please
accept
nsas
fundamental
assumptions
that
both
strong
cryptography
against
outsiders
and
the
ability
to
wiretap
some
domestic
users
is
necessary
if
you
feel
it
necessary
to
challenge
those
assumptions
do
it
in
the
context
of
the
last
issue
i
present
below
right
here
im
discussing
just
the
technical
aspects
and
no
i
dont
by
any
means
claim
that
just
because
something
can
be
done
it
should
be
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
whole
architecture
is
actually
going
to
be
used
just
because
clipper
chips
are
made
this
way
doesnt
mean
that
thats
the
only
way
theyll
be
made
maybe
the
nsa
will
substitute
its
own
chips
between
the
programming
facility
and
the
shipping
dock
and
theyll
generate
bogus
warrant
requests
so
that
the
escrow
agents
dont
wonder
why
theyve
never
called
sorry
guys
all
them
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
and
pedophiles
seem
to
have
bought
tripledes
phones
instead
whod
a
thunk
it
i
have
no
answer
to
this
question
and
at
the
moment
i
dont
see
a
way
of
answering
it
those
concerns
are
part
of
my
reasoning
in
my
answer
to
the
final
question
below
the
third
and
most
serious
issue
is
whether
or
not
clipper
is
a
good
idea
even
if
carried
out
strictly
according
to
the
letter
of
the
law
i
think
that
the
answer
is
no
but
its
not
a
nobrainer
im
a
civil
libertarian
not
a
libertarian
for
reasons
that
i
explained
at
great
length
on
the
net
in
the
elder
days
and
that
i
dont
have
the
energy
to
repeat
now
but
that
means
that
im
willing
to
accept
that
some
laws
are
necessary
so
long
as
they
respect
the
essential
rights
of
individuals
the
government
already
has
the
ability
and
in
our
system
the
right
to
issue
search
warrants
and
while
that
power
has
certainly
been
abused
its
also
been
used
quite
properly
and
fairly
in
other
cases
is
key
escrow
sufficiently
different
i
think
so
but
again
its
not
an
easy
question
for
me
it
is
easy
for
libertarians
to
answer
of
course
since
clipper
is
completely
alien
to
much
of
the
rest
of
their
oftadmirable
philosophy
and
its
also
easy
for
those
who
give
their
unreserved
trust
to
government
a
group
im
much
more
distant

they

something
of

well
that
wont

because
don

posted
a
good
partial
solution
to
this
problem
to
comprisks
ill
present
my
variant
on
it
instead
since
i
feel
its
a
bit
stronger
against
some
likely
attempts
to
cheat
depends
on
the
protocol
thats
followed
for
reading
traffic
briefly
the
cops
get
a
wiretap
warrant
and
record
the
call
they
then
notice
the
encryption
and
the
disclosure
header
it
along
with
a
copy
of
their
warrant
is
sent
to
the
fbi
or
whoever
it
is
who
holds
the
family
key
the
fholder
decrypts
the
header
and
sends
the
serial
number
n
and
the
encrypted
session
key
uk
to
the
escrow
agents
they
in
turn
use
and
to
recover
k
and
send
that
to
the
local
police
note
how
this
solves
the
problem
of
wiretapping
forever
neither
the
cops
nor
the
fbi
ever
see
u
so
they
cant
read
other
traffic
every
request
must
be
validated
by
both
the
fbi
and
the
escrow
agents
the
cops
and
the
fbi
together
cant
cheat
since
they
dont
have
u
i
regard
that
as
a
likely
pairing
of
folks
who
might
try
to
beat
the
system
its
to
prevent
this
that
i
modified
alvarezs
scheme
the
escrow
agents
cant
read
the
conversation
since
they
dont
have
it
all
they
have
is
n
and
uk
and
the
police
dont
even
see
n
its
harder
to
see
how
to
block
decryption
of
old
warrantless
wiretaps
there
is
one
protection
you
have
to
persuade
the
escrow
agents
that
the
call
is
current
but
thats
not
nearly
as
strong
there
are
approaches
i
can
see
that
might
work
involving
sequences
of
data
on
an
unalterable
medium
complete
with
cryptographic
protection
against
insertion
onto
a
new
medium
but
i
dont
have
anything
yet
that
isnt
too
complex
for
comfort

too
hard

it

that
the

would
do
the

it
wasnt
clear
to
me
from

whether
this
would

done

not

whether
the

would
just
decrypt

would

one
thing
im
a
bit
puzzled
by
why
arent
they
doing
this
with
a

you
could
generate

then
escrow
the

with
the

set
the

up
to
encrypt
the

key
with
both
public

to
decrypt
a

both
escrow

in

for

everybody
is

go

people

examine
your

books

find
out
how
many

led
to
democratic

democratic

governments
i
think
youll
only
find
one
in
over
five
thousand

actually
its
not
quite
that
bad
but
its
close
i
think
everyone
would
just
as
soon
work
within
the
system
the
presence
of
the
possibility
of
using
the
bullet
box
instead
of
the
ballot
box
is
supposed
to
be
a
deterrent
by
keeping
the
price
of
massive
abuse
unacceptable
however
governments
being
what
they
are
sure
would
like
to
remove
that
deterrence
which
will
make
the
need
for

all
the
more
great

dont

em
till
you
dont

then
i
think
we
can
be
more
accurately
called

instead
of

the
idea
of
the
people
being
sovereign
over
the

is
sure
not
in
vogue
in
the

is

look
we
collectively
have
the
power
to
throw
the

out
but
we
dont
use
it
we
clearly
dont
need
to
go
burning
things
down
but
we
not

the

its

there
are
eight

all

do
need

throw
at

some
of

out
unfortunately
the
bums
have
learned
to
target
only
small
groups
of
people
at

so
the
masses
wont
react

throw
them
out
eventually
the
masses
will
react
unless
the

cease

what
would
you
do

in

this

please
accept
nsas
fundamental
assumptions
that
both
strong

the

some

is
necessary
ill
accept
the
second
assumption
only
for
the
sake
of
argument
in
my
view
the
primary
remaining
flaw
is
that
the
encryption
algorithm
is
secret
leading
to
suspicion
that
there
is
a
back
door
without
complete
disclosure
this
suspicion
cannot
be
dispelled
no
matter
how
many
trusted
experts
are
allowed
to
look
at
it
in
isolation
is
it
possible
to
do
this
whole
thing
with
a
public
algorithm
the
only
concern
ive
seen
with
making
skipjack
public
is
that
someone
could
build
clipperphones
without
registering
the
keys
assume
f
can
really
be
kept
secret
as
the
government
assumes
then
as
part
of
the
initial
connection
a
clipperphone
executes
a
protocol
with
the
pseudophone
to
demonstrate
that
they
both
know
f
for
example
the
initiating
phone
picks
a
number
q
and
sends
eq
f
the
receiver
sends
back
f
and
the
initiator
sends
back
f
to
demonstrate
that
her
first
packet
wasnt
just
a
random
block
repeat
in
the
opposite
direction
with
another
q
so
it
cant
be
defeated
by
somebody
building
up
a
library
of
sequential
numbers
by
remembering
responses
and
using
those
responses
as
the
initial
numbers
of
subsequent
challenges
this
way
clipperphones
will
talk
only
to
other
clipperphones
of
course
the
pseudo
company
can
build
their
own
proprietary
skipjack
phone
but
the
presidential
fact
sheet
implies
that
they
wont
get
approval
for
it
without
equivalent
key
escrow
whats
wrong
with
this
picture
it
depends
of
f
staying
secret
and
on
skipjack
being
resistant
to
cryptanalysis
but
the
government
appears
to
believe
in
both
of
these
even
if
the
particular
qa
i
suggest
has
some
flaw
i
imagine
theres
a
zeroknowledgeproof
protocol
that
doesnt
smb
says
the
third
and
most
serious
issue
is
whether
or
not
clipper
is
a
good
idea
even
if
carried
out
strictly
according
to
the
letter

how

description
of
something
called
a
fair
crypto
system
in
the
may
issue
of
byte
p
attributed
to
mit
professor
silvio
micali
the
way
it
works
is
as
follows
you
generate
your
private
key
s
and
break
it
up
into
pieces
and
such
that
mod
p
s
you
give
each
piece
etc
to
a
different
escrow
agency
the
agencies
each
compute
gsn
mod
p
and
forward
the
result
to
the
public
key
telephone
book
keeper
the
public
key
telephone
book
keeper
multiplies
all
the
gsn
mod
p
reduces
the
result
to
mod
p
and
this
will
be
the
users
public
key
now
if
there
were
several
hundered
recognized
escrow
agencies
and
the
user
could
give
a
piece
of
the
key
to
each
of
the
ones
he
trusted
the
result
would
be
something
of
an
improvement
over
the
proposed
clipper
system
i
still
dont
think
key
escrow
is
a
good
idea
for
both
philosophical
and
security
reasons
but
i
do
offer
this
suggestion
simply
to
determine
whether
escrow
advocates
are
at
all
interested
in
considering
alternatives
in
good
faith
or
whether
the
goal
is
to
insure
the
use

only
two

spinelessness

encode

at

tends

number
the

likely
is

etc
plus
or
minus
some
shenanigans
of

id
hate

id
recording
the

then
doing

quick
crosslookup

your

mistakenly
maybe
you
sold
the

at

garage
sale
or
the
phone
was
stolen
from
your
car
or
whatever
they
might
only
know

side
of

is
for

anyone
who
thinks
the

is

to
crosscorrelate
such

loses
two
points
first
law
enforcement
agencies
can
of
course
do
this
second
theyre
only
forbidden
from
budgeting
any
money
for
it
the
irs
for
example
does
do
this
anyhow
they
just
dont
spend
any
money
on
it
so
its
technically
legal
i
guess
instead
they
probably
trade
little
favors
with
companies

mastercard
if
youre
the
irs
ill
bet
you
have

the

theory
that

that

either

vary
among

that
anyone

plow

my
interpretation
of

description
is
that
and
are
chosen
randomly
by
agents
of
the
key
escrow
companies
at
the
start
of
each

i
imagine
that
the

are
in

will
allow

all

fairly
quickly
there
would

some

my
guess
as
to
why
this
procedure
is
used
is
that
basing
the
keys
on
the
and
using
a
specified
algorithm
provides
an
inprinciple
checkable
way
to
verify
that
no
back
doors
exist
in
the
choice
of
the
random
numbers
used
to
generate
the
keys
since
we
have
to
trust
the
escrow
companies
anyway
it
does
not
weaken
the
system
to
have
the
keys
be
generated
from
random
seeds
entered
by
the
escrow
agents
and
since
the
algorithm
for
keygeneration
is
public
modulo
skipjack
secrecy
then
in
principle
an
agent
could
challenge
the
procedure
ask
for
and
to
be
exposed
and
run
his
own
independent
calculation

and
to
verify
that
that
is

what

im

anything

can

explains

anyone
point

a

a

information
about

maybe
a

you

that

spying

isnt

after

were

opposed

who
considered
themselves
perfectly

mr

the

disagree

note

a

once

to
spy

one
cannot
discourage
the
move
to
empower
the

with
the
means
to
parry
this
attack
on
personal
privacy
unfortunately
the
comment
was
with

to
the

the
point
remains
more
and

i
see
the

slowly
washing

even

do
you

without

im
tired

it
there
is
imho
no
compromise
with
an
administration
that
seeks
to
implement
these
proposals
under
the
guise
of
enhancing
privacy
more
than
the
proposals
themselves
i
read
the
language
of
the
press
releases
the
obvious
deception
involved
in
presenting
these
pieces
to
the
public
and
i
am
sickened
i
am
revolted
i
am
repulsed
perhaps
even
of
this
country
could
care
less
about
the
clipper
chip
the
wiretap
bill
the
smart
card
because
they
are
so
entrapped
in
the
rhetoric
of
the
clinton
administration
the
problem
is
the
people
are
not
having
the
scope
or
implicataions
pointed
out
to
them
hell
most
havent
even
heard
of
clipper
and
when
they
do
it
will
be
in
soothing
language
telling
everyone
how
nice
the
government
is
at
letting
them
have
privacy
how
come
the
media
is
not
telling
about
the
provisions
of
the
clipper
decision
the
provisions
of
the
crime
bill
the
abuses
of
civil
forfeiture
the
government
uses
polls
to
support
percent
of
the
people
want
gun
bans
etc
yet
the
same
pollsters
have
determined
according
to
the
media
that
percent
of
the
people
are
unaware
of
what
the
holocaust
is
the
people
cannot
be
expected
to
give
decent
decisions
when
they
are
denied
the
information
that
all
these
abuses
and
whittling
away
of
rights
are
going
on
quietly
when
they
find
out
when
it
hits
them
it
will
be
too
late
one
cannot
expect
each
citizen
to
spend
all
their
time
probing
searching
researching
etc
for
example
how
big
a
percentage
of
the
average
population
even
has
access
to

way
less
than

i
bet
how
many
outside

are
even
aware
of
what
big

is
doing
or
have
been
exposed
to
arguments
of
both

of
the
issue
what
the
public
will
get
is
only
one
side
the

side
that
is
scary
this
saddens
and
frightens
me
i
am

believe
it

not

order
conserveative
but
the
move

authoratarian

really
scares
me
mostly
because
i
know
you
cant
go
far
wrong
underestimating
the
intelligence
of
the
american
people
tell
them
its
going

keep
them
safe
from
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
and
they
will
let
you
put

how
can
the

of
the

when
the

refuses
to
do
it
even
in
the

you
find
those

somebody
once
said
something

is

only
to
be
used
in

it
is

the

and
murder
to
be
quite
honest
the

call

could
perform
realtime
fullduplex
encrypted
audio
with
resulting

rates
sustainable
by
todays

this

program
reads
linearlyencoded
audio
from
the

device
compresses
it
with
gsm
compresses
frames
of
samples
recorded
at
into

resulting
in
a

rate
encrypts
it
with

reverses
the
process
and
sends
the
reconstructed

back
to
the

the
compressed
encrypted
audio
stream
is
kbitss
my
sparcstation
ipc
not
exactly
a
very
fast
machine
these
days
certainly
slower
than
an
elc
would
just
barely
sustain
this
activity
audio
underruns
would
occcur
but
the
speech
was
very
intelligible
i
ran
it
as
a
realtime
process
to
get
the
best
results
remember
though
that
this
program
is
a
quick
hack
and
the
performance
can
certainly
be
improved
the

can

dear
secretary
brown
as
you
know
i
have
long
been
interested
in
the
privacy
and
security
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
data
in
a
networked
environment
recent
reports
concerning
the
administrations
endorsement
of
an
electronic
encryption
standard
based
upon
clipper
chip
technology
have
raised
a
number
of
related
issues
the
international
competitiveness
of
us
high
tech
manufacturers
and
the
software
industry
is
a
key
factor
that
the
government
should
consider
when
addressing
issues
of
encryption
and
data
security
as
the
nation
moves
forward
in
developing
the
national
communications
and
information
infrastructure
security
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
network
data
will
be
an
increasingly
important
factor
for
protecting
the
privacy
of
users
the
hacker
community
can
compromise
the
integrity
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
databases
linked
by
the
network
the
people
and
businesses
that
use
the
nations
telecommunications
network
and
the
personal
computers
linked
through
it
increasingly
are
demanding
that
information
be
protected
against
unauthorized
access
alteration
and
theft
i
am
concerned
that
the
administrations
plan
may
mean
that
to
remain
competitive
internationally
us
companies
would
be
compelled
to
develop
two
products
one
for
us
government
customers
and
another
for
private
commercial
users
who
may
want
a
higher
encryption
standard
this
may
inadvertently
increase
costs
to
those
us
companies
hoping
to
serve
both
markets
to
assist
the
subcommittees
analysis
of
this
issue
please
respond
to
the
following
questions
has
the
encryption
algorithm
or
standard
endorsed
by
the
administration
been
tested
by
any
entity
other
than
nsa
nist
or
the
vendor
if
so
please
identify
such
entities
and
the
nature
of
testing
performed
if
not
please
describe
any
plans
to
have
the
algorithm
tested
by
outside
experts
and
how
such
experts
will
be
chosen
under
the
administrations
plan
what
entities
will
be
the
holders
of
the
keys
to
decrypt
scrambled
data
what
procedures
or
criteria
will
the
administration
utilize
to
designate
such
key
holders
does
the
encryption
algorithm
endorsed
by
the
administration
contain
a
trap
door
or
back
door
which
could
allow
an
agency
or
entity
of
the
federal
government
to
crack
the
code
it
is
clear
that
over
time
changes
in
technologies
used
for
communications
will
require
new
techniques
and
additional
equipment
how
will
encryption
devices
adapt
to
the
rapid

of

technology
what
additional

would

if
the

the

so
be
it
ah
but
developing
cryptosystems
which
are
specificially
designed
to
protect
the
governments
domestic
spying
capabilities
takes
them
beyond
that
mandate
into
the
forbidden
field
of
domestic
wiretapping
the
nsas
charter
forbids
them
from
doing
any
purely

i
would
think
that
even

is
a
violation
of

it

how
can
we

it

we

the

seems

want
to

it
in

anyone
can

we
are
worried
about
a
back
door
once
everyone
uses
a

chip
the
mechanism
for
a
bigbrother
government
is
in
place
a
change
of
government
can
lead
to
it
especially
since
the
escrow
agencies
operation
is
not
governed
by
law
so
the
president
can
change
the
rules
to
allow

to

at

few

are

the

since
the

be
requested
by

executive

approved
by

it
seems
clear
that
one
of
the
key
registering
bodies
should
be
under
the
control
of
the

suggest
the
supreme

the

more

the

another

use
a

as

earlier
the

is
a
lot
less
noisy
than
a
standard
crt
but
since
many
laptops
have
power
supplies
that
run
at

instead
of
they
would
be
considerably
quieter
im
afraid
this
doesnt
work
either
we
can
pick
up
laptop
screens
without
any

most
of
the
socalled
low

monitors
are
also
useless
the
description
turns
out
to
a
marketing
assertion
rather
than
an
engineering
one
we
thought
there
might
be
a
market
for
a
monitor
which
was
not
as
hugely
expensive
as
the
military
tempest
kit
but
which
was
well
enough
shielded
to
stop
eavesdropping
using
available
receivers
we
built
a
prototype
it
works
and
its
still
sitting
on
my
lab
bench
commercial
interest
was
exactly
zero
in
the
absence
of
open
standards
a
monitor
which
really
is
low
radiation
and
costs
dollars
more
cant
compete
against
a
monitor
which
just
claims
to
be

re
clipper
and
conference
calls
just
curious
how
would
the
clipper
chip
system
handle
conference
calls
depending
on
the
encryption
system
so
long
as
everyone
has
the
same
key
it
can
be
done
for
example
i
was
using
vat
which
is
an
internet
audio
tool
for
a
conference
call
and
we
were
encrypting
the
session
unfortunately
one
site
was
doing
more
work
and
didnt
have
the
cpu
for
it
so
it
didnt
sound
all
that
good
at
a
different
site
you
would
have
to
use
something
other
than
the
att
black
box
in
other
words
i
dont
think
public
key
would
work
the
session
key
would
have
to
be
agreed
upon
prior
to
the
conversation
and
distributed
to
all
sites
beforehand

glenn
thanks
for
posting
that
i
was
surprised
to
notice
however
that
one
question
i
might
have
expected
to
be
asked
was
not
are
all
forms
of
strong
encryption
other
than
the
clipper
to
be
made
illegal
speaking
of
which
is
anyone
aware
of
whether
that
question
has
been
asked
of
any
knowledgeable
or
official
spokesperson
for
the
government
i
have
not
yet
seen
it
mentioned
in
any
of
a
dozen
places
it
might
have
been
reported
but
i
could
have
easily
missed
it
please
let
us
know
if
you
get
a
solid
answer
to
the
question
of
legality
of
other
strong
cryptosystems
so
far
any
references
i
have
seen
have
been
weaselwords
more
plans
in
the
future
etc
but
nothing
that
could
be
taken
as
a
no
strong
crypto
will
not
be
outlawed
i
have
heard
not
verified
that
the
crime
bill
before
congress
has
language
that
either
requires
escrow
of
keys
or
that
will
regard
all
systems
unapproved
for
public
use
like
strong
cryptosystems
not
trivially
broken
by
the
govt
or
without
escrowed
keys
which
one
cannot
readily
change
read
use
being
only
permitted
by
folks
with
special
connections
or
government
agencies
as
either
terrorist
tools
or
drug
dealers
tools
not
outlawed
specifically
but
by
added
civil
forfeiture
powers
and
clever
wording
effectively
outlawed
for
all
intents
and
purposes
now
for
some
idle
speculation
for
those
who
dont
care
hit
n
now
crypto
being
effectively
outlawed
could
be
done
without
specifically
outlawing
any
class
of
crypto
systems
for
example
a
crowbar
hammers
screwdrivers
and
such
can
be
regarded
as
burglar
tools
pretty
much
at
the
whim
of
the
authorities
based
primarily
on
the
individual
possessing
them
in
the
car
etc
not
being
in
a
trade
that
makes
routine
use
of
these
tools
in
a
like
manner
one
who
has
no
legitimate
need
govt
definition
for
strong
crypto
software
or
systems
and
is
caught
using
them
might
find
themselves
in
possession
of
terrorist
tools
in
other
words
if
one
is
not
working
for
a
corporation
with
extremely
sensitive
commercial
data
that
warrants
in
the
feds
opinion
strong
security
or
a
government
agency
and
securing
only
workrelated
data
not
personal
data
one
will
most
likely
be
nailed
on
this
if
discoverd
a
personal
desire
for
privacy
most
certainly
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
legitimate
need
why
do
you
want
such
strong
security
especially
from
legitimate
law
enforcement
an
individual
with
legitimate
endeavors
would
not
be
so
concerned
government
is
not
in
the
business
of
revealing
your
personal
secrets
to
the
public
so
you
must
be
trying
to
conceal
or
planning
to
conceal
some
unlawful
or
criminal
activity
do
you
have
something
to
hide
hmmmm
i
expect
that
initially
there
will
be
some
people
selected
either
at
random
or
who
happen
to
have
been
troublemakers
for
the
purposes
of
making
an
example
for
those
who
think
the
feds
are
not
serious
about
this
mega
s
one
asking
about
a
right
to
privacy
will
probably
get
a
response
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
privacy
spelled
out
as
such
an
argument
used
in
the
abortion
debate
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
have
security
that
legitimate
law
enforcement
cannot
break
as
suggested
in
the
clipper
press
release
this
in
a
nutshell
is
what
i
find
so
extremely
frightening
not
only
for
crypto
systems
as
in
this
case
but
for
the
precident
it
will
set
laying
the
groundwork
for
future
erosions
of
privacy
escrow
of
both
safedeposit
box
keys
master
keys
or
combinations
for
privately
owned
safes
and
so
on
why
not
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
way
to
make
an
endrun
around
those
inconvenient
parts
of
the
us
constitution
a
law
cannot
be
easily
declared
unconstitutional
if
it
there
is
no
specific
law
it
would
simply
be
a
minor
extension
of
the
rico
statutes
or
wod
policies
a
simple
policy
decision
just
like
so
many
of
the
gun
regulations
are
mainly
batf
policy
decisions
the
conversation
of
the
fed
agents
would
go
something
like
we
are
gonna
seize
your
home
your
computers
your
car
your
bank
account
you
dont
have
to
undress
and
give
us
yer
clothes
unless
you
have
a
floppy
in
yer
pocket
because
they
are
all
connected
with
your
acquisition
transport
and
use
of
terrorist
tools
andor
drug
dealers
tools
part
of
the
wod
or
against
terrorism
ya
unnerstand
no
decent
american
subject
would
be
against
these
noble
causes
note
we
are
not
accusing
you
of
any
wrongdoing
we
are
only
saying
your
home
computers
car
bank
assets
are
connected
with
wrongdoing
somehow
they
housed
transported
and
funded
these
terrorist
tools
only
a
civil
matter
hehheh
we
had
this
tipgrin
therefore
the
constitutional
protection
on
individual
rights
do
not
apply
we
are
arresting
the
tainted
property
not
youevil
grin
if
you
wish
to
deposit
a
bond
hire
some
attorneys
and
go
to
court
to
prove
the
innocence
of
this
property
that
they
are
not
terrorist
tools
and
again
to
prove
they
are
not
also
drug
dealers
tools
go
ahead
we
have
no
problem
with
that
course
with
your

assets
seized
no
car
computer
or
home
probably
no
job
too
and
your
lessthanlimitless

you
might
run
into
some
minor
practical
difficulties
grin
that
is
what
has
me
going
so
damned
ballistic
it
is
exactly
how
the
logic
goes
when
someone
gives
a
tip
that
your
home
has
been
used
to
store
drugs
note
no
trace
of
drugs
need
to
be
found
on
the
property
only
some
bozo
who
will
say
yup
i
stored
stuff
in
that
dudes
house
probably
to
get
out
of
a
year
sentence
for
dealing
much
more
cost
effective
to
let
him
walk
to
bust
another
day
and
hit
the
jackpot
with
your
assets
ob
disclaimer
of
course
ok
note
that
i
am
not
a
lawyer
and
can
only
base
these
speculations
on
what
i
have
readheardbeen
told
regarding
past
civil

cases
and
how
they
are
used
to
augment
the
budgets
of
assorted

to

of
folks
who
just
want
to
be
left
alone
or
who
do
not
wish
to
be
put
in
a
risky
situation
especially
in
areas
where
they
are
denied
either
meaningful
police
protection
and
the
means
to
be
able
to
even
pretend
to
defend
themselves
as
is
quite
common
back
east
like

nyc

out

these

have
the
choice
of
cowering
under

or
cowering
under
threats
of

gangbangers
helpless
in
either
case
all
behind
some

who
drops
a

on
you
for
his

or
behind
the
feds
wanting
to

example
civil

being
the
hook
point
is
are
these
speculations
way
out

or
are
they
all
too
typical
and
if
so
does
the

to

and
just
about

this
tracks
the
thread
why
people
dont
need
strong
crypto
the
atomic
energy
act
of
expressly
forbids
thinking
about
building
nuclear
devices
while
i
was
in
grad
school
a
friend
of
mine
got
a
security
clearance
to
work
on
the
defense
for
the
progressive
magazine
he
found
lots
of
articles
which
were
public
domain
removed
from
the
local
engineering
library
madison
wisconsin
so
the
lawyers
sent
him
all
over
the
states
to
other
libraries
to
show
that
the
information
in
the
article
was
already
public
what
pissed
everyone
off
was
a
local
underground
paper
went
and
published
the
article
anyway
it
had
been
precensored
by
the
feds
thats
what
this
was
all
about
so
the
judge
declared
the
case
moot
the
atomic
energy
act
of
has
never
been
tested
in
court
from
my
discussions
with
several
people
familiar
with
the
case
only
other
times
has
this
preemptive
clause
been
used
in
every
case
the
people
simply
did
what
they
felt
like
and
courts
tossed
the
cases
out
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
government
does
have
precidence
for
declaring
things
classified
after
it
has
been
published
while
i
was
working
on
star
wars
this
happened
to
me
my
clearance
was
in
the
works
and
i
developed
a
method
for
tracking
particle
beams
it
was
good
enough
to
classify
so
i
was
no
longer
allowed
to
work
on
it
a
friend
from
canada
was
in
the
same
boat
he
developed
a
method
to
compute
stripping
cross
sections
but
because
the
subject
was
classified
he
was
not
allowed
to
present
his
own
paper
at
a
conference
he
later
published
it
in
an
open
journal
without
problems
when
the
going
gets
wierd
the
wierd
turn
pro
the
feds
can
do
whatever
they
want
whenever
they
feel
like
it
and
they
will
make
up
rules
to
let
themselves
get
away
with
it
since
the
mass
media
cant
tell
the
difference
between
a
joke
and
the
real
thing
like
ranch
appocolypse
for
the
waco
massacre
dont
count
on
them
to
help
spread
the
word
about
their
loss
of
freedom
the
government
can
make
strong
crypto
illegal
so
what
since
the
government
does

really
like
to
see
such

developed
so
that

ideally
though
it

it
should
be

that
nobody

able

obviously
to
make

easy
for

it

why

i
concur
for

but
for

like

it
makes
me
cringe
at
the

do

getting

is

have
a
solution
use

take
your

use
them
on
point
to
point
conversations
through
the
phone
and
thats
it
if
you
need
to
tell
someone
something
secret
and
very
important
wouldnt
it
make
more
sense
to
write
it
out
concisely
and
if
its
just
a
quick
yo
then
use
a

spend
your

there
are
three
issues
with
clipper
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
architecture
of
the
whole
scheme
is
capable
of
working
my
answer
with
one
significant
exception
is
yes
i
really
do
think
that
nsa
and
nist
have
designed
this
scheme
about
as
well
as
can
be
assuming
that
their
real
objectives
are
as
stated
to
permit
wiretapping
under
certain
carefullycontrolled
circumstances
with
a
minimum
risk
of
abuse
the
exception
is
that
u
exists
outside
of
the
chip
on
a
programming
diskette
thats
seriously
wrong
and
should
be
loaded
onto
the
chip
separately
to
those
who
disagree
and
i
dont
claim
my
answer
is
obvious
though
i
found
my
own
reasoning
sufficiently
persuasive
that
i
was
forced
to
rewrite
the
conclusions
section
of
my
technical
analysis
paper
i
had
originally
blasted
the
scheme
i
issue
this
invitation
assume
that
you
were
charged
with
implementing
such
a
system
with
complete
regard
for
civil
rights
and
due
process
what
would
you
do
differently
in
answering
this
question
please
accept
nsas
fundamental
assumptions
that
both
strong
cryptography
against
outsiders
and
the
ability
to
wiretap
some
domestic
users
is
necessary
if
you
feel
it
necessary
to

those
assumptions
do
it
in

the
last

i

im

technical

someone
posted
such

but
apparently
the

hundreds

this
is
a
real

my
understanding
of
the
current

that

takes
is
it
gets
downloaded
on
floppy

and
is
processed
by
retiree
volunteers
who
match
the

against
message
profiles
and
check
the

count
ie
yeah
thats
a

whats
this

must
be

gays
in

the

i

a

another

two
at

my
understanding
is
that
the

speed
will
increase
direct
internet
instead
of
compuerve
to

but
the

processing
will
remain
the

unless
the

at

print

distribute
this

every

you
may
have
better
luck
printing
out
a

on

that
flat
white

all
over
my

and
snailmailing
it

i
imagine

heck
why
not

while

the

i
agree
that
printing

you

probably
better
because
it

to
eliminate

basic

i
would

the

point
the

must
have

the

implementation
must
make
it
possible
to
verify
that
the
advertised
algorithm
is
in
fact
the
one
that
is
being
used
the
key
must
be
quickly
changeable
by
the
user
and
must
be
of
a
sufficient
length
and
complexity
to
defeat
any
bruteforce
search
possible

in

near

requirements
are

describes
an
example

the

hereby
introduced
can
be
used
to
detect
tampered
clipper
signals
where
some
public
enemy
replaced
the
le
block
by
random
data
and
of
course
the
le
block
would
be
used
to
initialise
the
encryption
of
the

so
that
at
the

the
correct

must
be
processed
in

to
have
any
chance
of
getting
the
plaintext
back
for
those
of
you
who
might
want
to
mangle
the
le

eg
by
xoring
a
constant
pattern
on
the
transmission
line
and
restore
it
before
feeding
it
into
the
receiving
crippler
chip
i
would
add
further
encrypted
copies
of
this
block
perhaps
created
by
repeated
application
of
the
encryption
algorithm
or
so
at
regular
intervals
during
the
transmission
if
the
receiving
chip
detects
a
mismatch
it
must
assume
that
the
line
is
bad
and
it
will
cease
to
work
in
your
own
interest
you
are
protected
from
getting
faulty
plaintext
you
know
its
just
like
a

for
your
own
safety
the
monitoring
agencies
wont
have
the
famous
black
box
which
is
needed
for

decryption
and
will
be
kept
by
the
fbi
but
nothing
prevents
them
from
using
special
boxes
which
will
do
the
redundancy
check
for
the
serial
number
block
and
consistency
checks
on
the
embedded
le

within

these
boxes
will
turn
a

light
on

soon
as
they
detect

that
violates

so
dont
anyone

that
they
are
not
supported
funded
or
overtly
controlled
by

thats
one
problem
that
has
so
far
been
overlooked
these
two
escrow
agencies
will
have
to
create
a
secure
database
and
service
the
input
and
output
of
keys
who
pays
for
this
if
they
refuse
an

request
from
some
congressman
to
deliver
a

can
their
budget

to

them
will
congress
be

them
forever
congress
isnt
forced

do
anything
not
even
follow

hasnt
affected
his

at

inside
congress
at
least
he
is
still
pushing
his
police
state
agenda
the
problem
is
that
laws
can
change
congress
may
pass
a
law
setting
up
an
escrow
agency
with
instructions
that
keys
are
private
some
future
congress
may
change
that
law
suppose
prenazi
germany
had
a
clipper
system
do
you
think
the
escrow
agencies
would
have
told
hitler
that
he
could
not
have
the
keys
without
a
valid
court
order
it
will
be
like
the
old
saw
in
new
jersey
and
new
york
chicago
etc
when
the
politicians
promised
that
this
spiffy
new
gun
registration
law
will
not
be
used
for
future
confiscation
purposes
sure
enough
a
few
years
later
when
they
were
used
just
for
that
purpose
and
folks
complained
the
response
was
well
i
didnt
make
that
promise
some
politicians
may
not
even
wait
a
few
years
escrowed
keys
would
have
the
same
assurances
of
security
besides
if
someone
wants
to
snoop
how
are
you
to
know
you
dont
think
they
will
send
you
a
letter
saying
we
are

snooping
on

do
you
what
are
the
assurances
the

people
will
not
be
forbidden
to
report
any
access
attempts
for

keys
so
much
for
government
assurances
of

in
effect
you
must
set
up
escrow
agencies
as
a
fourth
branch
of
the
goverment
and
isolate
them
from

they

you

seems

that

the

time
the

from

you
all
mention

have
expressed
concerns

the
question
that

why
cant
someone
take

reverse

it
i

take
the
thing
to

testing

one

just
pry
off
the

start

figure
out

i
remembered
a

that

use

work

had
one
of
these

that
they
used

that

they
could
actually
find

and
show

where
in

it
was
i
am
sure
that
many
companies

must
have
these

and
that
the
potential
is
there
especially
at
a
university
where
the
security
at

a

is
looser
for

take

most
of
us
can
afford
a
stamp
and
an
envelope
and
the
cost
of
printing
out
a
letter
if
some
kind
soul
out
there
would
write
a

and
upload
it

everyone

btw
im
working

dear
senatorcongressmanpresident
fill
in
the
blank
i
am
writing
you
to
voice
my
strong
opposition
to
president
clintons
clipper
chip
initiative
this
proposal
to
establish
a
secret
government
designed
cryptography
chip
with
government
key
registration
as
the
standard
for
voice
encryption
is
very
disturbing
the
idea
that
citizens
must
register
their
secrets
with
the
government
just
in
case
they
are
trying
to
keep
them
secret
is
patently
unamerican
additionally
the
press
release
for
this
program
strongly
implied
that
other
forms
of
cryptography
would
be
banned
after
the
clipper
chip
standard
is
in
place
this
latest
attack
on
our
civil
rights
is
deeply
disturbing
and
is
frankly
a
voting
issue
for
me
the
presidents
press
release
stated
that
the
plan
strikes
a
balance
between
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
and
a
citizens
right
to
privacy
but
this
is
not
the
case
the
fact
is
that
since
other
strong
cryptographic
equipment
is
avalible
the
criminals
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
mentioned
in
the
press
release
will
simply
use
non
clipper
cryptography
meanwhile
the
average
citizen
may
gain
no
protection
against
warentless
wiretaps
by
the
government
since
the
government
escrowed
key
is
derived
deterministicly
from
the
unit
serial
number
which
is
broadcast
by
the
chip
durring
its
opperation
this
seems
like
an
obvious
back
door
for
the
nsa
and
law
enforcement
if
you
still
do
nott
understand
my
objection
to
key
registration
consider
the
way
j
edgar

would

now

some

that
how
can
the

when

because
much
of

arent

look
at

of

with
the
usual

journals
all
they

note
media
in

is
the
popular

tv
radio
daily

such
publications
as

all
that
and
they
all

pretty

there
seems
to
be
an
air
of
arrogance
that
the
individual
is
not
capable
of
understanding
major
issues
so
the
media
doesnt
bother
to
inform
them
as
with
clipper
for
example
or
tells
the
people
how
to
interpret
events
in

what
is
lost
sight
of
is
that
the
people
are
not
good
at
understanding
things
because
they
are
not
told
accurate
information
about

it
is
a
lot
to
expect
of
the
people
for
them
to
be
clarirvoyant
for

i
would
have
been
unaware
of

i
not

it
up
on

how
much

has

the

has
to
spend
time
digging
many
folks
especially
who
work
long
hours
have
families
etc
do
not
have
time
to
go
digging
and
many
are
not
yet
aware
things
are
wrong
so
are
not
motivated
to
dig
not
saying
its
right
just
saying
that
is
the
way
things
are
people
arent
upset
about
things
when
they
arent
told
and
the
less
than
objective
media
is
a
major
contributer
to
the
problem
and
then
compound
that
with
an
attitude
of
arrogance
in
the
civil

bureaucrats
politicians
that
act
as

some

tend
to
fall
into

the

the
fellow

who
shot
the

he
pushed

on

else
ends
up
walking
where
a
less
wellconnected
person
would
have
been
crucified
a
typical
example
of
one
standard
for
us
a
much
more
restrictive
standard
for
other
folk
perhaps
i
am
not
real
eloquent
in
expressing
this
but
the
solution
sure
as
hell
is
not
to
make
it
harder
for
people
to
find
out
what
is
going
on
or
dismiss
their
concerns
because
one
happens
to
be

was

i
feel
the
reason
was
it
dovetailed
with
their

views
on
the
subject
and
it
involved
a

isnt
it
time
for

the

only

run
by

and
permit
him
to
paw
thru
our

longings
if
it
beeps
but
i
think
that
mindset
is
a
mistake
before
there
were
cattle
prods
governments
tortured
their
prisoners
with
clubs
and
rubber
hoses
before
there
were
lasers
for
eavesdropping
governments
used
binoculars
and
lipreaders
though
government
certainly
uses
technology
to
oppress
the
evil
lies
not
in
the
tools
but
in
the
wielder
of
the
tools
in
fact
technology
represents
one
of
the
most
promis
ing
avenues
available
for
recapturing
our
freedoms
from
those
who
have
stolen
them
by
its
very
nature
it
favors
the
bright
who
can
put
it
to
use
over
the
dull
who
can
not
it
favors
the
adaptable
who
are
quick
to
see
the
merit
of
the
new
over
the
sluggish
who
cling
to
time
tested
ways
and
what
two
better
words
are
there
to
de
scribe
government
bureaucracy
than
dull
and
sluggish
one
of
the
clearest
classic
triumphs
of
technology
over
tyranny
i
see
is
the
invention
of
the
manportable
crossbow
with
it
an
untrained
peasant
could
now
reliably
and
lethally
engage
a
target
out
to
fifty
meterseven
if
that
target
were
a
mounted
chainmailed
knight
unlike
the
longbow
which
admittedly
was
more
powerful
and
could
get
off
more
shots
per
unit
time
the
crossbow
required
no
formal
training
to
utilize
whereas
the
longbow
required
elaborate
visual
tactile
and
kinesthetic
coordination
to
achieve
any
degree
of
accuracy
the
wielder
of
a
crossbow
could
simply
put
the
weapon
to
his
shoulder
sight
along
the
arrow
itself
and
be
reasonably
assured
of
hitting
his
tar
get
moreover
since
just
about
the
only
mounted
knights
likely
to
visit
your
average
peasant
would
be
government
soldiers
and
tax
collectors
the
utility
of
the
device
was
plain
with
it
the
common
rabble
could
defend
themselves
not
only
against
one
another
but
against
their
governmental
masters
it
was
the
medieval
equivalent
of
the
armor
piercing
bullet
and
consequently
kings
and
priests
the
medieval
equivalent
of
a
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
crossbows
threatened
death
and
excommunication
respec
tively
for
its
unlawful
possession
looking
at
later
developments
we
see
how
technology
like
the
firearmparticularly
the
repeating
rifle
and
the
handgun
later
followed
by
the
gatling
gun
and
more
advanced
machine
gunsradically
altered
the
balance
of
interpersonal
and
intergroup
power
not
without
reason
was
the
colt
called
the
equalizer
a
frail
dancehall
hostess
with
one
in
her
possession
was
now
fully
able
to
protect
herself
against
the
brawniest
roughneck
in
any
saloon
advertise
ments
for
the
period
also
reflect
the
merchandising
of
the
repeating
cartridge
rifle
by
declaring
that
a
man
on
horseback
armed
with
one
of
these
rifles
simply
cannot
be
captured
and
as
long
as
his
captors
were
relying
upon
flintlocks
or
singleshot
rifles
the
quote
is
doubtless
a
true
one
updating
now
to
the
present
the
publickey

with
a
personal
computer
to

it
represents
an

a
defensive

not
only
can
such
a
technique
be

like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
sketch
the
mathemat
ics
which
makes
this
principle
possible
this
algorithm
is
called
the
rsa
algorithm
after
rivest
shamir
and
adleman
who
jointly
created
it
its
security
derives
from
the
fact
that
if
a
very
large
number
is
the
product
of
two
very
large
primes
then
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
the
two
prime
factors
from
analysis
of
their
product
ex
tremely
in
the
sense
that
if
primes
p
and
q
have
digits
apiece
then
their
product
cannot
in
gen
eral
be
factored
in
less
than
years
by
the
most
powerful
computer
now
in
existence
the
public
part
of
the
key
consists
of
the
prod
uct
pq
of
the
two
large
primes
p
and
q
and
one
fac
tor
call
it
x
of
the
product
xy
where
xy
the
private
part
of
the
key
consists
of
the
other
factor
y
each
block
of
the
text
to
be
encrypted
is
first
turned
into
an
integereither
by
using
ascii
or
even
a
simple
representation
this
integer
is
then
raised
to
the
power
x
modulo
pq
and
the
resulting
integer
is
then
sent
as
the
encrypted
message
the
receiver
decrypts
by
taking
this
integer
to
the
secret
power
y
modulo
pq
it
can
be
shown
that
this
process
will
always
yield
the
original
number
started
with
what
makes
this
a
groundbreaking
development
and
why
it
is
called
publickey
cryptography
is
that
i
can
openly
publish
the
product
pq
and
the
number
x
while
keeping
secret
the
number
y
so
that
anyone
can
send
me
an
encrypted
message
namely
x
a
mod
pq
but
only
i
can
recover
the
original
message
a
by
taking
what
they
send
raising
it
to
the
power
y
and
taking
the
result
mod
pq
the
risky
step
meeting
to
exchange
cipher
keys
has
been
eliminated
so
people
who
may
not
even
trust
each
other
enough
to
want
to
meet
may
still
reliably
ex
change
encrypted
messageseach
party
having
selected
and
disseminated
his
own
pq
and
his
x
while
maintaining
the
secrecy
of
his
own
y
another
benefit
of
this
scheme
is
the
notion
of
a
dig
ital
signature
to
enable
one
to
authenticate
the
source
of
a
given
message
normally
if
i
want
to
send
you
a
message
i
raise
my
plaintext
a
to
your
x
and
take
the
result
mod
your
pq
and
send
that
however
if
in
my
message
i
take
the
plaintext
a
and
raise
it
to
my
secret
power
y
take
the
result
mod
my
pq
then
raise
that
result
to
your
x
mod
your
pq
and
send
this
then
even
after
you
have
normally
decrypted
the
message
it
will
still
look
like
garbage
however
if
you
then
raise
it
to
my
public
power
x
and
take
the
result
mod
my
public
pq
so
you
will
not
only
recover
the
ori
ginal
plaintext
message
but
you
will
know
that
no
one
but
i
could
have
sent
it
to
you
since
no
one
else
knows
my
secret
y
and
these
are
the
very
concerns
by
the
way
that
are
to
day
tormenting
the
soviet
union
about
the
whole
question
of
personal
computers
on
the
one
hand
they
recognize
that
american
schoolchildren
are
right
now
growing
up
with
com
puters
as
commonplace
as
sliderules
used
to
bemore
so
in
fact
because
there
are
things
computers
can
do
which
will
interest
and
instruct
and
and
it
is
pre
cisely
these
students
who
one
generation
hence
will
be
going
headtohead
against
their
soviet
counterparts
for
the
soviets
to
hold
back
might
be
a
suicidal
as
continuing
to
teach
swordsmanship
while
your
adversaries
are
learning
ballistics
on
the
other
hand
whatever
else
a
personal
computer
may
be
it
is
also
an
exquisitely
efficient
copying
machinea
floppy
disk
will
hold
upwards
of
words
of
text
and
can
be
copied
in
a
couple
of
minutes
if
this
werent
threatening
enough
the
computer
that
performs
the
copy
can
also
encrypt
the
data
in
a
fashion
that
is
all
but
unbreakable
remember
that
in
soviet
society
publicly
ac
cessible
xerox
machines
are
unknown
the
relatively
few
copying
machines
in
existence
are
controlled
more
inten
sively
than
machine
guns
are
in
the
united
states
now
the
conservative
position
is
that
we
should
not
sell
these
computers
to
the
soviets
because
they
could
use
them
in
weapons
systems
the
liberal
position
is
that
we
should
sell
them
in
the
interests
of
mutual
trade
and
cooperationand
anyway
if
we
dont
make
the
sale
there
will
certainly
be
some
other
nation
willing
to
for
my
part
im
ready
to
suggest
that
the
libertarian
position
should
be
to
give
them
to
the
soviets
for
free
and
if
necessary
make
them
take
them
and
if
that
doesnt
work
load
up
an
blackbird
and
air
drop
them
over
moscow
in
the
middle
of
the
night
paid
for
by
private
sub
scription
of
course
not
taxation
i
confess
that
this
is
not
a
position
that
has
gained
much
support
among
members
of
the
conventional
leftright
political
spectrum
but
af
ter
all
in
the
words
of
one
of
illuminatuss
characters
we
are
political
noneuclideans
the
shortest
distance
to
a
particular
goal
may
not
look
anything
like
what
most
people
would
consider
a
straight
line
taking
a
long
enough
worldview
it
is
arguable
that
breaking
the
soviet
govern
ment
monopoly
on
information
transfer
could
better
lead
to
the
enfeeblement
and
indeed
to
the
ultimate
dissolution
of
the
soviet
empire
than
would
the
production
of
another
dozen
missiles
aimed
at
moscow
but
theres
the
rub
a
long
enough
world
view
does
suggest
that
the
evil
the
oppressive
the
coercive
and
the
simply
stupid
will
get
what
they
deserve
but
whats
not
immediately
clear
is
how
the
rest
of
us
can
escape
being
killed
enslaved
or
pauperized
in
the
process
when
the
liberals
and
other
collectivists
began
to
at
tack
freedom
they
possessed
a
reasonably
stable
healthy
functioning
economy
and
almost
unlimited
time
to
proceed
to
hamstring
and
dismantle
it
a
policy
of
political
gradualism
was
at
least
conceivable
but
now
we
have
patchwork
crazyquilt
economy
held
together
by
baling
wire
and
spit
the
state
not
only
taxes
us
to
feed
the
poor
while
also
inducing
farmers
to
slaughter
milk
cows
and
drive
up
food
pricesit
then
simultaneously
turns
around
and
sub
sidizes
research
into
agricultural
chemicals
designed
to
in
crease
yields
of
milk
from
the
cows
left
alive
or
witness
the
fact
that
a
decline
in
the
price
of
oil
is
considered
as
potentially
frightening
as
a
comparable
increase
a
few
years
ago
when
the
price
went
up
we
were
told
the
economy
risked
collapse
for
for
want
of
energy
the
price
increase
was
called
the
moral
equivalent
of
war
and
the
feds
swung
into
action
for
the
first
time
in
american
history
the
speed
at
which
you
drive
your
car
to
work
in
the
morning
be
came
an
issue
of
federal
concern
now
when
the
price
of
oil
drops
again
we
risk
problems
this
time
because
ameri
can
oil
companies
and
third
world
basketcase
nations
who
sell
oil
may
not
be
able
to
ever
pay
their
debts
to
our
grossly
overextended
banks
the
suggested
panacea
is
that
government
should
now
reraise
the
oil
prices
that
opec
has
lowered
via
a
new
oil
tax
since
the
government
is
seeking
to
raise
oil
prices
to
about
the
same
extent
as
opec
did
what
can
we
call
this
except
the
moral
equivalent
of
civil
warthe
government
against
its
own
people
and
classically
in
international
trade
can
you
imag
ine
any
entity
in
the
world
except
a
government
going
to
court
claiming
that
a
vendor
was
selling
it
goods
too
cheaply
and
demanding
not
only
that
that
naughty
vendor
be
compelled
by
the
court
to
raise
its
prices
but
also
that
it
be
punished
for
the
act
of
lowering
them
in
the
first
place
so
while
the
statists
could
afford
to
take
a
couple
of
hundred
years
to
trash
our
economy
and
our
libertieswe
certainly
cannot
count
on
having
an
equivalent
period
of
stability
in
which
to
reclaim
them
i
contend
that
there
exists
almost
a
black
hole
effect
in
the
evolution
of
nationstates
just
as
in
the
evolution
of
stars
once
free
dom
contracts
beyond
a
certain
minimum
extent
the
state
warps
the
fabric
of
the
political
continuum
about
itself
to
the
degree
that
subsequent
reemergence
of
freedom
becomes
all
but
impossible
a
good
illustration
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
area
of
socalled
welfare
payments
when
those
who
sup
at
the
public
trough
outnumber
and
thus
outvote
those
whose
taxes
must
replenish
the
trough
then
what
possible
choice
has
a
democracy
but
to
perpetuate
and
expand
the
tak
ing
from
the
few
for
the
unearned
benefit
of
the
many
go
down
to
the
nearest
welfare
office
find
just
two
people
on
the
dole
and
recognize
that
between
them
they
form
a
voting
bloc
that
can
forever
outvote
you
on
the
question
of
who
owns
your
lifeand
the
fruits
of
your
lifes
labor
so
essentially
those
who
love
liberty
need
an
edge
of
some
sort
if
were
ultimately
going
to
prevail
we
obvi
ously
cant
use
the
altruists
otherdirectedness
of
work
slave
suffer
sacrifice
so
that
next
generation
of
a
billion
random
strangers
can
live
in
a
better
world
recognize
that
however
immoral
such
an
appeal
might
be
it
is
nonetheless
an
extremely
powerful
one
in
todays
culture
if
you
can
convince
people
to
work
energetically
for
a
cause
caring
only
enough
for
their
personal
welfare
so
as
to
remain
alive
enough
and
healthy
enough
to
continue
workingthen
you
have
a
truly
massive
reservoir
of
energy
to
draw
from
equally
clearly
this
is
just
the
sort
of
ap
peal
which
tautologically
cannot
be
utilized
for
egoistic
or
libertarian
goals
if
i
were
to
stand
up
before
you
tonight
and
say
something
like
listen
follow
me
as
i
enunciate
my
noble
cause
contribute
your
money
to
support
the
cause
give
up
your
free
time
to
work
for
the
cause
strive
selflessly
to
bring
it
about
and
then
after
you
and
your
children
are
dead
maybe
your
childrens
children
will
actu
ally
live
under
egoismyoud
all
think
id
gone
mad
and
of
course
youd
be
right
because
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
libertarianism
andor
egoism
will
be
spread
if
when
and
as
individual
libertarians
andor
egoists
find
it
profitable
andor
enjoyable
to
do
so
and
probably
only
then
while
i
certainly
do
not
disparage
the
concept
of
poli
tical
action
i
dont
believe
that
it
is
the
only
nor
even
necessarily
the
most
costeffective
path
toward
increasing
freedom
in
our
time
consider
that
for
a
fraction
of
the
investment
in
time
money
and
effort
i
might
expend
in
try
ing
to
convince
the
state
to
abolish
wiretapping
and
all
forms
of
censorshipi
can
teach
every
libertarian
whos
in
terested
how
to
use
cryptography
to
abolish
them
unilaterally
there
is
a
maxima
proverbgenerally
attributed
to
the
eskimoes
which
very
likely
most
libertarians
have
al
ready
heard
and
while
you
likely
would
not
quarrel
with
the
saying
you
might
well
feel
that
youve
heard
it
often
enough
already
and
that
it
has
nothing
further
to
teach
us
and
moreover
that
maybe
youre
even
tired
of
hearing
it
i
shall
therefore
repeat
it
now
if
you
give
a
man
a
fish
the
saying
runs
you
feed
him
for
a
day
but
if
you
teach
a
man
how
to
fish
you
feed
him
for
a
lifetime
your
exposure
to
the
quote
was
probably
in
some
sort
of
a
workfare
vs
welfare
context
namely
that
if
you
genuinely
wish
to
help
someone
in
need
you
should
teach
him
how
to
earn
his
sustenance
not
simply
how
to
beg
for
it
and
of
course
this
is
true
if
only
because
the
next
time
he
is
hungry
there
might
not
be
anybody
around
willing
or
even
able
to
give
him
a
fish
whereas
with
the
information
on
how
to
fish
he
is
completely
self
sufficient
but
i
submit
that
this
exhausts
only
the
first
order
content
of
the
quote
and
if
there
were
nothing
further
to
glean
from
it
i
would
have
wasted
your
time
by
citing
it
again
after
all
it
seems
to
have
almost
a
cryptoaltruist
slant
as
though
to
imply
that
we
should
structure
our
ac
tivities
so
as
to
maximize
the
benefits
to
such
hungry
beggars
as
we
may
encounter
but
consider
suppose
this
eskimo
doesnt
know
how
to
fish
but
he
does
know
how
to
hunt
walruses
you
on
the
other
hand
have
often
gone
hungry
while
traveling
thru
walrus
country
because
you
had
no
idea
how
to
catch
the
damn
things
and
they
ate
most
of
the
fish
you
could
catch
and
now
suppose
the
two
of
you
decide
to
exchange
information
bartering
fishing
knowledge
for
hunting
knowledge
well
the
first
thing
to
observe
is
that
a
transaction
of
this
type
categorically
and
unambiguously
refutes
the
marxist
premise
that
every
trade
must
have
a
winner
and
a
loser
the
idea
that
if
one
person
gains
it
must
necessarily
be
at
the
expense
of
another
person
who
loses
clearly
under
this
scenario
such
is
not
the
case
each
party
has
gained
some
thing
he
did
not
have
before
and
neither
has
been
dimin
ished
in
any
way
when
it
comes
to
exchange
of
information
rather
than
material
objects
life
is
no
longer
a
zerosum
game
this
is
an
extremely
powerful
notion
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
the
first
and
second
laws
of
thermodynamicsall
those
laws
which
constrain
our
possi
bilities
in
other
contextsno
longer
bind
us
now
thats
anarchy
or
consider
another
possibility
suppose
this
hungry
eskimo
never
learned
to
fish
because
the
ruler
of
his
nationstate
had
decreed
fishing
illegal
because
fish
contain
dangerous
tiny
bones
and
sometimes
sharp
spines
he
tells
us
the
state
has
decreed
that
their
consumptionand
even
their
possessionare
too
hazardous
to
the
peoples
health
to
be
permitted
even
by
knowledgeable
willing
adults
perhaps
it
is
because
citizens
bodies
are
thought
to
be
government
property
and
therefore
it
is
the
function
of
the
state
to
punish
those
who
improperly
care
for
govern
ment
property
or
perhaps
it
is
because
the
state
gener
ously
extends
to
competent
adults
the
benefits
it
provides
to
children
and
to
the
mentally
ill
namely
a
fulltime
allpervasive
supervisory
conservatorshipso
that
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
with
making
choices
about
behavior
thought
physically
risky
or
morally
naughty
but
in
any
case
you
stare
stupefied
while
your
eskimo
informant
re
lates
how
this
law
is
taken
so
seriously
that
a
friend
of
his
was
recently
imprisoned
for
years
for
the
crime
of
pos
session
of
nine
ounces
of
trout
with
intent
to
distribute
now
you
may
conclude
that
a
society
so
grotesquely
oppressive
as
to
enforce
a
law
of
this
type
is
simply
an
affront
to
the
dignity
of
all
human
beings
you
may
go
far
ther
and
decide
to
commit
some
portion
of
your
discretion
ary
recreational
time
specifically
to
the
task
of
thwarting
this
tyrants
goal
your
rationale
may
be
altruistic
in
the
sense
of
wanting
to
liberate
the
oppressed
or
egoistic
in
the
sense
of
proving
you
can
outsmart
the
oppressoror
very
likely
some
combination
of
these
or
per
haps
even
other
motives
but
since
you
have
zero
desire
to
become
a
martyr
to
your
cause
youre
not
about
to
mount
a
military
campaign
or
even
try
to
run
a
boatload
of
fish
through
the
blockade
however
it
is
here
that
technologyand
in
particular
in
formation
technologycan
multiply
your
efficacy
literally
a
hundredfold
i
say
literally
because
for
a
fraction
of
the
effort
and
virtually
none
of
the
risk
attendant
to
smuggling
in
a
hundred
fish
you
can
quite
readily
produce
a
hundred
xerox
copies
of
fishing
instructions
if
the
tar
geted
government
like
presentday
america
at
least
permits
open
discussion
of
topics
whose
implementation
is
re
stricted
then
that
should
suffice
but
if
the
government
attempts
to
suppress
the
flow
of
information
as
well
then
you
will
have
to
take
a
little
more
effort
and
perhaps
write
your
fishing
manual
on
a
floppy
disk
encrypted
according
to
your
mythical
eskimos
publickey
parameters
but
as
far
as
increasing
realworld
access
to
fish
you
have
made
genuine
nonzero
headwaywhich
may
continue
to
snowball
as
others
redisseminate
the
information
you
have
provided
and
you
have
not
had
to
waste
any
of
your
time
trying
to
convert
id
eological
adversaries
or
even
trying
to
win
over
the
unde
cided
recall
harry
brownes
dictum
from
freedom
in
an
unfree
world
that
the
success
of
any
endeavor
is
in
general
inversely
proportional
to
the
number
of
people
whose
persua
sion
is
necessary
to
its
fulfilment
if
you
look
at
history
you
cannot
deny
that
it
has
been
dramatically
shaped
by
men
with
names
like
washington
lincoln
nixon
marcos
duvalier
khadaffi
and
their
ilk
but
it
has
also
been
shaped
by
people
with
names
like
edison
curie
marconi
tesla
and
wozniak
and
this
latter
shaping
has
been
at
least
as
per
vasive
and
not
nearly
so
bloody
and
thats
where
im
trying
to
take
the
libertech
project
rather
than
beseeching
the
state
to
please
not
en
slave
plunder
or
constrain
us
i
propose
a
libertarian
net
work
spreading
the
technologies
by
which
we
may
seize
freedom
for
ourselves
but
here
we
must
be
a
bit
careful
while
it
is
not
at
present
illegal
to
encrypt
information
when
government
wants
to
spy
on
you
there
is
no
guarantee
of
what
the
fu
ture
may
hold
there
have
been
bills
introduced
for
exam
ple
which
would
have
made
it
a
crime
to
wear
body
armor
when
government
wants
to
shoot
you
that
is
if
you
were
to
commit
certain
crimes
while
wearing
a
kevlar
vest
then
that
fact
would
constitute
a
separate
federal
crime
of
its
own
this
law
to
my
knowledge
has
not
passed
yet
but
it
does
indicate
how
government
thinks
other
technological
applications
however
do
indeed
pose
legal
risks
we
recognize
for
example
that
anyone
who
helped
a
precivil
war
slave
escape
on
the
underground
railroad
was
making
a
clearly
illegal
use
of
technologyas
the
sovereign
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
at
that
time
found
the
buying
and
selling
of
human
beings
quite
as
acceptable
as
the
buying
and
selling
of
cattle
simi
larly
during
prohibition
anyone
who
used
his
bathtub
to
ferment
yeast
and
sugar
into
the
illegal
psychoactive
drug
alcoholthe
controlled
substance
winewas
using
technol
ogy
in
a
way
that
could
get
him
shot
dead
by
federal
agents
for
his
crimeunfortunately
not
to
be
restored
to
life
when
congress
reversed
itself
and
repermitted
use
of
this
drug
so
to
quote
a
former
president
unindicted
co
conspirator
and
pardoned
felon
let
me
make
one
thing
perfectly
clear
the
libertech
project
does
not
advocate
participate
in
or
conspire
in
the
violation
of
any
lawno
matter
how
oppressive
unconstitutional
or
simply
stupid
such
law
may
be
it
does
engage
in
description
for
educa
tional
and
informational
purposes
only
of
technological
processes
and
some
of
these
processes
like
flying
a
plane
or
manufacturing
a
firearm
may
well
require
appropriate
li
censing
to
perform
legally
fortunately
no
license
is
needed
for
the
distribution
or
receipt
of
information
it
self
so
the
next
time
you
look
at
the
political
scene
and
despair
thinking
well
if
of
the
nation
and
of
this
state
and
of
this
city
have
to
turn
libertarian
before
ill
be
free
then
somebody
might
as
well
cut
my
goddamn
throat
now
and
put
me
out
of
my
miseryrecognize
that
such
is
not
the
case
there
exist
ways
to
make
your
self
free
if
you
wish
to
explore
such
techniques
via
the
project
you
are
welcome
to
give
me
your
name
and

a
fake

youll

any

or
acquaintances
whom
you
think
would
be

are
welcome
as
well
im
not
even
asking
for

self

since
my

can

la

are
down
in
the
noise
compared
with

i
give
a
summary
on
my
recent
question
in
article
pqscbcnhminniezdvunimainzde
i
wrote
the
recent
discussion
in
this
news
group
suggests
that
a
key
search
attack
against
des
is
quite
feasible
now
but
normally
des
is
applied
in
cbc
or
cfb
mode
where
one
chooses
a
random
init
vector
of
bytes
questions
makes
it
sense
to
handle
the
init
vector
as
an
additional
key
then
we
have
a
bit
key
if
yes
is
anything
known
about
the
security
of
this
key
scheme
can
we
break
it
faster
than
by
exhaustive
search
through
the
bit
key
space
unfortunately
the
answer
is
no
concealing
the
initialisation
vector
essentially
doesnt
give
any
additional
security
i
got
answers
from
gradynetcomcom
marklomasclcamacuk
smbresearchattcom
that
opened
my
eyes
its
pretty
simple
say
e
is
encryption
and
d
decryption
with
key
k
on
blocks
let
be
the
initialisation
vector
the
message
blocks
the
cipher
text
blocks
then
encryption
in
cipher
block
chaining
cbc
mode
works
by
the
formula
ci
emi
xor
and
decryption
by
mi
xor
dci
so
if
the
attacker
doesnt
have
this
only
affects
the
first
message
block
but
she
can
do
her
key
search
attack
on
the
situation
in
cipher
feedback
cfb
mode
is
a
bit
more
complicated
but
similar
and
left
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
finally
there
is
the
modified
output
feedback
mode
ofb
where
des
or
whatever
block
cipher
you
use
simply
acts
as
random
generator
by
si
with
initialisation
vector
seed
and
encryption
is
given
by
ci
mi

youre
reading
far
too
much
into
this
aside
from
the
obvious
fact
that
you
shouldnt
hold
anybody
to
what
they
wrote
in

old

in

rapidly
changing
field
like
this
quite
simply
she
says
that
the
security
should
not
depend
on
the
secrecy
of
the
algorithm
a
secret
algorithm
can
still
be
secure
after
all
we
just
dont
know
it
only
our
level
of
trust
is
affected
not
the
security
of
the
system
the
algorithm
could
be
rsa
for
all
we
know
which
we
believe
to
be
secure
they
have
a
much
better
reason
to
classify
the
algorithm
than
to
protect
its
security
they
want
to
protect
its
market
share
if
they
publish
the
algorithm
then
shortly
manufacturers
would
make
chips
that
implement
the
algorithm
and
standard
but
do
not
use
a
key
stored
in
escrow
and
of
course
everybody
would
buy
them
the
whole
push
of
this
chip
is
that
by
establishing
a
standard
that
you
can
only
use
if
you
follow
their
rules
they
get
us
to
follow
their
rules
without
enacting
new
laws
that
we
would
fight
tooth
and
nail
quite
simply
with
clipper
established
it
would
be
much
harder
for
another
encryption
maker
to
define
a
new
standard
to
make
phones
that
cant
talk
to
the
leading
phone
companies
the
result
is
tappable
cryptography
without
laws
forbidding
other
kinds
for
of
the
populace
to
get
untappable
crypto
you
would
have
to
build
a
special
phone
that
runs
on
top
of
this
system
and
everybody
you
talk
to
would
have
to
have
an
indentical

the

is
using

special

to
solve

of

to

they
cant
wiretap

nobody

had

do

at

however
using
the

they

they

currently
it

anybody
using

can
listen

the

also
obviously

make
it
much
more
difficult
for
the

to
eavesdrop
note
that

who

not

speak

if
an
illegal
operation
is
really
worth
one
can
afford
having
critical
data
carried
by
a
person
rather
than
sending
it
electronically
the
clipper
chip
will
not
change
this
the
problem
is
more
politic
foreign
countries
will
never
accept
the
clipper
chip
is
the
access
to
the
escrow
cannot
be
directly
granted
to
their
own
police
following
their
own
law
not
the
us
law
ie
each
country
will
have
its
own

how
then
will
it
be
possible
to
monitor
the
international

or
will

be
possible
or
will
there
be
an

this
will
be
more
and
more
impossible
as
the
volume

will
increrase
in
the

think
that
the

only
be
an
interesting
device
to
limit
the
risk
of

ones

husband
listening

it
will
bring
no
more
as

is
it
worth
i
think
so
if
its
cost
is
limited
i
think
that
many
privacy
invasions
are
done
not
only
by
official
services
but
also
by
private
entities
the

help
reducing
these

the
need
to
allow
some
commercial
concerns
particularly
financial
institutions
a
level
of
protection
against
tempest
threat
led
to
a
series
of
briefings
to
invited
corporations
and
to
the
release
of
a
cutdown
tempest
stansard
for
commercial
use
i
say
release
for
while
equipment
to
meet
the
standard
is
available
at
a

and
to
approved

afaik
even

standard
remains

though
government
certainly
uses

oppress
the
evil
lies
not
in

but
in
the
wielder
of
the

evil
and
good
walk

in

it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the

lies
in
the

technology
represents
one
of
the
most
promis
ing
avenues
available
for
recapturing
our
freedoms
from
those
who
have
stolen
them
i
cannot
accept
this
ridiculous
leap
in
logic
technology
is
neutral
to
good
or
evil
when
technology
is
used
by
evil
men
it
is
called
evil
technology
when
it
is
used
by
good
men
it
is
called
good
technology
really
it
is
just
technology
that
allows
action
to
be
realized
more
efficently
and
on
a
larger
scale
by
its
very
nature
it
favors
the
bright
who
can
put
it
to
use
over
the
dull
who
can
not
try
not
to
confused
the
development
of
technology
with
its
use
certainly
bright
people
will
be
better
at
creating
technology
but
even
young
children
know
how
to
program
vcr
machines
are
vcr
machines
not
extremely
complex
to
create
it
favors
the
adaptable
who
are
quick
to
see
the
merit
of
the
new
over
the
sluggish
who
cling
to
time
tested
ways
adaptibility
and
flexibility
is
always
better
at
enduring
than
the
stiff
and
stubborn
a
young
child
is
soft
and
supple
an
old
man
is
stiff
and
inflexible
a
dripping
of
water
can
cut
through

this
has
nothing
to

how

than

can
do

finding
some

very
much

not

the

you
might

dont

enough
about

this

is

really
workable

either

the

not

can
we

though
im
not

how
to

they
provide
an
obvious
firstattempt
might
be
to
prepend
a

unpredictable
for
eve
block
to
the

and
then
calculate
a
crc
which
included
the
random
starting
block
and
all
of
the

this
could
be
encrypted
after
the
message
the
problem
is
im
not
sure
its
impossible
to
come
up
with
a
message
that
will
hash
to
the
same
crc
regardless
of
the
random
starting
block
it
intuitively
seems
like
it
ought
to
be
hard
but
im
not
that
sure
clearly
a
cryptostrength
hash
like
or
the
sha
would
be
stronger
but
again
im
not
sure
im
comfortable
claiming
that
its
unbreakable
a
scheme
to
use
up
some
of
the
pad
bits
to
decide
how
many
bits
of
to
include
in
the
plaintext
stream
before
going
on
wouldnt
be
too
bad
either
at
the
cost
of
increasing
the
speed
with
which
you
use
up
your

this
could
be

to
give
you
arbitrarily
low
probability
that
your

could
spoof

spot
that

will
show
that

funnys

for

bit
mi
we

that
doesnt
is
a

for
our
wouldbe
spoofer
at

she
has

im
trying
to
see
how
to
quantify
her
chances
of
making
it
all
the
way
through
the
spoofed
message
but
it
gets
a
little
complicated
because
she
can
get
un
synched
and
still
happen
to
have
a
in
that
place
in

spoofed

now
i
can
see
a
simple
way
of
doing
this
thats
got
to
be
as
secure
as
a
onetime
pad
at
a
cost
of
using
times
the
message
length
in
pad
bits
for
each
message
bit
mi
use
one
random
bit
ri
and
xor
them
together
to
get
xi
now
encrypt
the
three
bits
with
the
onetime
pad
the
enemy
has
no
way
of
guessing
what
ri
is
so
heshe
cant
guess
what
xi
is
either
any
change
she
makes
in
the
ciphertext
stream
will
have
to
involve
a
guess
of
what
ri
was
is
there
any
way
to
do
this
without
using
so
many
pad
bits
spoofing
the
message
is
equivalent
to
correctly
guessing
as
many
random
bits
as
there
are
bits
in
the
message
clearly
this
makes
spoofing
messages
just

hard

you
know
the
whole

text
as
if
you

distribution
etc
imply
that
the
clients
really
do
want
that
level
of
security
these
same
people
want
to
keep
p
a
secret
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
eve
might
happen
to
have
a
copy
of
p
lying
around
i
am
aware
that
the
same
argument
applies
to
eve
knowing
even
a
small
part
of
the
message
but
eve
must
know
exactly
where
which
bytes
in
c
her
known
susequence
starts
or
the
result
will
be
garbled
i
find
this
at
least
as
surprising
back
to
the
question
if
i
had
the
resources
to
use
a
onetimepad
for
such
transmissions
i
would
also
append
a
message
authentication
code
to
the
message
using
up
the
next
bits
of
the
onetimepad
as
the
key
perhaps
your
original
question
basically
asked
whether
there
was
any
way
to
authenticate
the
message
with
the
same
degree
of
security
as
the
pad
itself
provided
and
i
dont
know
the
answer
however
i
would
propose
the
following
for
discussion
alice
and
bob
have
an
arbitrary
number
of
secret
random
bits
to
share
which
eve
doesnt
know
she
finds
them
out
effectively
by
knowing
some
p
and
the
corresponding
c
it
is
the
fact
that
they
correspond
that
causes
the
problem
if
a
message
authentication
code
was
to
be
created
using
some
onetimepad
operation
such
that
eve
could
not
know
which
parts
of
the
mac
were
affected
by
which
parts
of
the
input
she
would
be
unable
to
forge
a
mac
to
correspond
what
is
required
is
a
nonlinear
combiner
of
parts
of
the
message
nonlinear
so
that
simply
xoring
or
subtracting
or
whatever
doesnt
have
exactly
the
same
effect
now
at
the
end
of
the
encrypted
message
c
alice
appends
a
nbit
mac
computed
as
follows
means
the
next
full
chunk
of
the
one
time
pad
compute
p
xor
and
pad
to
an
nbit
boundary
with
more
of
s
break
into
nbit
chunks
set
mac
to
initialisation
vector
for
i
in
each
chunk
sequentially
set
mac
mac
nlop
at
the
end
of
this
process
mac
is
the
message
authentication
code
bob
verifies
the
mac
in
the
obvious
manner
he
recovers
the
plaintext
p
then
uses
some
more
of
his
pad
to
reproduce
the
mac
in
the
same
manner
nlop
is
the
nonlinear
operator
and
there
is
the
rub
the
simplest
nonlinear
operator
i
can
think
of
is
an
sbox
that
is
have
a
fixed
even
published
permutation
of
the
nbit
integers
an
indexable
table
called
sbox
and
use
x
nlop
y
x
xor
sboxy
practically
speaking
i
think
this
solves
your
problem
as
eve
never
sees
the
intermediate
output
and
hence
cant
deduce
or
perform
any
valid
substitution
on
it
also
practically
speaking
you
want
the
mac
to
be
fairly
large
say
bits
but
you
might
not
want
a
gigabyte
say
sbox
so
you
might
work
on
bytesized
sboxes
but
i
think
that
is
an
irrelevant
detail
for
the
discussion
at
hand
who
will
be
first
to
point
out
my
errors
or
give
me
a

what
is
ripem
ripem
is
a
program
which
performs
privacy
enhanced
mail
pem
using
the
cryptographic
techniques
of
rsa
and
des
it
allows
your
electronic
mail
to
have
the
properties
of
authentication
ie
who
sent
it
can
be
confirmed
and
privacy
ie
nobody
can
read
it
except
the
intended
recipient
ripem
was
written
primarily
by
mark
riordan
most
of
the
code
is
in
the
public
domain
except
for
the
rsa
routines
which
are
a
library
called
rsaref
licensed
from
rsa
data
security
inc
how
can
i
get
ripem
ripem
contains
the
library
of
cryptographic
routines
rsaref
which
is
considered
munitions
and
thus
is
exportrestricted
from
distribution
to
people
who
are
not
citizens
or
permanent
residents
of
the
us
or
canada
therefore
the
following
request
is
quoted
from
the
readme
file
please
do
not
export
the
cryptographic
code
in
this
distribution
outside
of
the
usa
or
canada
this
is
a
personal
request
from
me
the
author
of
ripem
and
a
condition
of
your
use
of
ripem
note
that
rsaref
is
not
in
the
public
domain
and
a
license
for
it
is
included
with
the
distribution
you
should
read
it
before
using
ripem
the
best
way
to
get
it
is
to
ask
a
friend
for
a
copy
since
this
will
reduce
the
load
on
those
sites
that
do
carry
it
not
to
mention
the
humans
that
run
them
naturally
this
requires
that
you
trust
the
friend
ripem
is
available
via
anonymous
ftp
to
citizens
and
permanent
residents
in
the
us
from
rsacom
cd
to
rsaref
and
read
the
readme
file
for
info
last
i
looked
this
site
contains
only
the
source
tree
and
does
not
contain
compiled
binaries
or
the
nice
mac
version
ripem
as
well
as
some
other
crypt
stuff
has
its
home
site
on
rpubclmsuedu
which
is
open
to
nonanonymous
ftp
for
users
in
the
us
and
canada
who
are

permanent

to
find
out
how
to
obtain

ftp
there
cd
to
pubcrypt
and
read
the
file
gettingaccess
for
convenience
binaries
for
many
architectures
are
available
here
in
addition
to
the
full
source
tree
will
ripem
run
on
my
machine
probably
it
has
already
been
ported
to
msdos
and
most
flavors
of
unix
sunos
next
linux
aix
ultrix
solaris
etc
ports
to
macintosh
include
a
standard
unixstyle
port
and
a
rather
nice
maclike
port
written
by
raymond
lau
author
of
stuffit
more
ports
are
expected
and
help
of
users
is
invited
will
ripem
work
with
my
mailer
probably
how
easy
and
clean
the
effective
interface
is
will
depend
on
the
sophistication
and
modularity
of
the
mailer
though
the
users
guide
included
with
the
distribution
discusses
ways
to
use
ripem
with
many
popular
mailers
including
berkeley
mush
elm
and
mh
code
is
also
included
in
elisp
to
allow
easy
use
of
ripem
inside
gnu
emacs
if
you
make
a
new
interface
for
ripem
or
create
an
improvement
on
one
in
the
distribution
which
you
believe
is
convenient
to
use
secure

may
be
useful

altsecurityripem
what
is
rsa
rsa
is
a
crypto
system
which
is
asymmetric
or
publickey
this
means
that
there
are
two
different
related
keys
one
to
encrypt
and
one
to
decrypt
because
one
cannot
reasonably
be
derived
from
the
other
you
may
publish
your
encryption
or
public
key
widely
and
keep
your
decryption
or
private
key
to
yourself
anyone
can
use
your
public
key
to
encrypt
a
message
but
only
you
hold
the
private
key
needed
to
decrypt
it
note
that
the
message
sent
with
rsa
is
normally
just
the
des
key
to
the
real
message
see
what
is
des
note
that
the
above
only
provides
for
privacy
for
authentication
the
fingerprint
of
the
message
see
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
encrypted
with
the
senders
private
key
the
recipient
can
use
the
senders
public
key
to
decrypt
it
and
confirm
that
the
message
must
have
come
from
the
sender
rsa
was
named
for
the
three
men
rivest
shamir
and
adleman
who
invented
it
to
find
out
more
about
rsa
ftp
to
rsacom
and
look
in
pubfaq
or
look
in
scicrypt
what
is
des
des
is
the
data
encryption
standard
a
widely
used
symmetric
or
secretkey
crypto
system
unlike
rsa
des
uses
the
same
key
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
messages
however
des
is
much
faster
than
rsa
ripem
uses
both
des
and
rsa
it
generates
a
random
key
and
encrypts
your
mail
with
des
using
that
key
it
then
encrypts
that
key
with
the
recipients
public
rsa
key
and
includes
the
result
in
the
letter
allowing
the
recipient
to
recover
the
des
key
des
is
sometimes
considered
weak
because
it
is
somewhat
old
and
uses
a
key
length
considered
too
short
by
modern
standards
however
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
against
an
opponent
smaller
than
a
large
corporation
or
government
agency
it
is
not
unlikely
that
future
ripems
will
strengthen
the
symmetric
cipher
possibly
by
using
multiple
encryption
with
des
what
is
pem
and
how
does
ripem
relate
pem
is
privacy
enhanced
mail
a
system
for
allowing
easy
transfer
of
encrypted
electronic
mail
it
is
described
in
rfcs
these
documents
have
been
approved
and
obsolete
the
old
rfcs
ripem
is
not
really
a
complete
implementation
of
pem
because
pem
specifies
certificates
for
authenticating
keys
which
ripem
does
not
handle
at
this
time
their
addition
is
planned
whats
this
about
distributing
and
authenticating
keys
for
a
remote
user
to
be
able
to
send
secure
mail
to
you
she
must
know
your
public
key
for
you
to
be
able
to
confirm
that
the
message
received
came
from
her
you
must
know
her
public
key
it
is
important
that
this
information
be
accurate
if
a
bad
guy
convinces
her
that
his
key
is
in
fact
yours
she
will
send
messages
which
he
can
read
ripem
allows
for
three
methods
of
key
management
a
central
server
the
distributed
finger
servers
and
a
flat
file
all
three
are
described
in
the
ripem
users
guide
which
is
part
of
the
distribution
none
of
them
provide
perfect
security
why
do
all
ripem
public
keys
look
very
similar
ripem
public
keys
begin
with
a
pkcs
identifier
describing
various
characteristics
about
the
key
so
the
first
bunch
of
characters
in
your
key
may
be
the
same
as
those
of
lots
of
other
peoples
keys
this
does
not
mean
your
keys
are
similar
but
only
that
they
are
the
same
class
of
key
were
generated
with
the
same
program
are
of
the
same
length
etc
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
a
message
digest
algorithm
produced
by
rsa
data
security
inc
it
provides
a
fingerprint
or
cryptographically
secure
hash
of
the
plaintext
it
is
cryptographically
secure
because
it
is
not
possible
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
computation
to
produce
a
different
plaintext
which
produces
the
same
fingerprint
thus
instead
of
signing
the
entire
message
with
the
senders
private
key
only
the
of
the
message
needs
to
be
signed
for
authentication
is
sometimes
used
for
other
purposes
for
example
it
is
often
used
to
map
an
input
of
arbitrary
length
to
bits
of
data
as
a
passphrase
interpreter
or
cookie
generator
is
described
in
its
entirety
including
an
implementation
in
c
in
rfc
what
is
pgp
pgp
is
another
cryptographic
mail
program
called
pretty
good
privacy
pgp
has
been
around
longer
than
ripem
and
works
somewhat
differently
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
in
any
way
though
pgp
does
also
use
rsa
some
major
differences
between
pgp
and
ripem
pgp
has
more
key
management
features
particularly
for
users
without
a
direct
network
connection
ripem
conforms
to
the
pem
rfcs
and
thus
has
a
greater
probability
of
working
with
other
pem
software
pgp
makes
no
attempt
to
be
compatible
with
anything
other
than
pgp
in
fact
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
pgp
ripem
uses
rsaref
a
library
of
rsa
routines
from
rsa
data
security
inc
rsaref
comes
with
a
license
which
allows
noncommercial
use
pgp
uses
its
own
implementation
of
rsa
which
is
not
licensed
thus
pkp
the
firm
holding
the
us
patents
on
the
rsa
algorithm
claims
that
it
is
a
infringement
of
that
patent
to
make
use
or
sell
pgp
in
the
us
or
canada
in
acknowledgement
of
this
pgps
original
author
phil
zimmermann
says
in
the
documentation
in
fact
if
you
live
in
the
usa
and
you
are
not
a
federal
agency
you
shouldnt
actually
run
pgp
on
your
computer
because
public
key
partners
wants
to
forbid
you
from
running
my
software
pgp
is
contraband
both
pgp
and
ripem
are
exportrestricted
and
cannot
be
sent
outside
the
us
and
canada
however
pgp
already
exists
on
many
ftp
sites
in
europe
and
other
places
whether
you
use
pgp
or
ripem
or
whatever
the
documentation
to
pgp
is
recommended
reading
to
anyone
interested
in
such
issues
note
that
the
above
facts
both
regarding
patent
and
export
restrictions
are
somewhat
controversial
many
people
think
it
shouldnt
be
that
way
and
some
people
interpret
various
documents
differently
unfortunately
discussions
of
it
on
the
net
inevitably
seem
to
produce
more
heat
than
light

probably
belong

what
about
rpem
rpem
stands
for
rabin
privacy
enhanced
mail
it
was
similar
to
ripem
but
used
a
publickey
cipher
invented
by
rabin
which
is
not
rsa
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
patent
on
rsa
it
was
written
by
mark
riordan
the
same
author
as
ripem
its
distribution
was
halted
when
contrary
to
the
beliefs
of
many
including
rabin
public
key
partners
pkp
claimed
that
their
patent
was
broad
enough
to
cover
any
publickey
cipher
whose
strength
rested
in
the
difficulty
of
factoring
products
of
large
primes
not
just
rsa
this
claim
is
not
universally
accepted
by
any
means
but
was
not
challenged
for
pragmatic
reasons
rpem
is
not
really
used
anymore
it
is
not
compatible
with
ripem

pgp

is
mime

compmailmime
how

interact
with

use
the

solution

applicationxripem

standards
will
emerge

note
that

probably
how

the
effective

will
depend
on
the

of

what
is
rsa
rsa
is
a
crypto
system
which
is
asymmetric
or
publickey
this
means
that
there
are
two
different
related
keys
one
to
encrypt
and
one
to
decrypt
because
one
cannot
reasonably
be
derived
from
the
other
you
may
publish
your
encryption
or
public
key
widely
and
keep
your
decryption
or
private
key
to
yourself
anyone
can
use
your
public
key
to
encrypt
a
message
but
only
you
hold
the
private
key
needed
to
decrypt
it
note
that
the
message
sent
with
rsa
is
normally
just
the
des
key

the
real
plaintext

the

disputeresolving

can

public

the

rsa

named
for
the
three
men

who
invented
it
to
find
out
lots
more
about
rsa
and
modern
cryptography
in
general
ftp

rsacom
and
look
in
pubfaq
some
information
also
may
be
in
scicrypt
what
is
des
des
is
the
data
encryption
standard
a
widely
used
symmetric
or
secretkey
crypto
system
unlike
rsa
des
uses
the
same
key
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
messages
however
des
is
much
faster
than
rsa
ripem
uses
both
des
and
rsa
it
generates
a
random
key
and
encrypts
your
mail
with
des
using
that
key
it
then
encrypts
that
key
with
the
recipients
public
rsa
key
and
includes
the
result
in
the
letter
allowing
the
recipient
to
recover
the
des
key
des
is
sometimes
considered
weak
because
it
is
somewhat
old
and
uses
a
key
length
considered
too
short
by
modern
standards
however
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
against
an
opponent
smaller
than
a
large
corporation
or
government
agency
it
is
not
likely
that
the
pem
standard
will
incorporate
support
for
other
symmetric
ciphers
in
the
near
future
because
there
is
a
strong
feeling
that
pem
should
be
stable
so
it
can
become
utilized
widely
without
early
problems
with
interoperability
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
a
message
digest
algorithm
produced
by
rsa
data
security
inc
it
provides
a
fingerprint
or
cryptographically
secure
hash
of
the
plaintext
it
is
cryptographically
secure
because
it
is
not
possible
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
computation
to
produce
a
different
plaintext
which
produces
the
same
fingerprint
thus
instead
of
signing
the
entire
message
with
the
senders
private
key
only
the
of
the
message
needs
to
be
signed
for
authentication
can
also
be
exchanged
directly
for
authentication
for
example
ripem
public
keys
include
an
of
the
public
key
in
the
file
so
parties
wishing
to
confirm
their
keys
are
authentic
via
a
separate
channel
merely
need
exchange
of
keys
and
verify
their
accuracy
is
sometimes
used
for
other
purposes
for
example
it
is
often
used
to
map
an
input
of
arbitrary
length
to
bits
of
data
as
a
passphrase
interpreter
or
cookie
generator
is
described
in
its
entirety
including
an
implementation
in
c
in
rfc
there
have
been
some
recent
suggestions
that
may
not
be
as
strong
a
hash
as
was
originally
believed
presumably
some
other
hash
function
will
be
used
if
this
is
accepted
as
true

these

have
been
approved

obsolete
the
old

ripem
is
not
really
a
complete
implementation
of

because
pem
specifies
certificates
for
authenticating

which
ripem
does
not
handle

their

whats
this
about
distributing

authenticating

for
a
remote

to
be

she
must
know

to
confirm
that
the

came

you
must
know

it
is
important
that
this

be
accurate
if
a
bad
guy
convinces
her
that
his
key
is
in
fact
yours
she
will
send

ripem
allows
for
three
methods
of

management
a
central

the
distributed
finger
servers
and
a
flat

all
three
are
described
in
the
ripem
users
guide
which
is
part
of
the
distribution
none
of
them
provide
perfect
security
the
pem
standard
calls
for
key

the
addition
of
this

to

is
planned
but
chickenegg
issues
still
exist
isnt
it
a
bad
idea
to
use

like

this
issue
has
been
considered
in
the

process
rfc
the

rfc
addresses
this

this
does
not
of

mean
that
all

or
that
everyone

an

the

the

pkp
has
licensed
this

to
a
considerable

ibm

pkp
has
also
threatened

filed

ripem
was
originally
created
with
no
connection
to
rsadsi
other
than
its
use
of
the
rsaref
library
and
for
no
reason
other
than
its
authors
desire
to
see
widespread
use
of
publickey
cryptography
however
after
the
ball
started
rolling
people
at
rsadsi
got
interested
rsadsi
decided
to
carry
ripem
on
its
ftp
site
and
some
people
there
started
making
their
own
ripem
keys
and
contributing
code
ripem
even
won

built
on
rsaref

award
why
do
all
ripem
public

look
very
similar
ripem
public

so
the

may
be
the
same
as
those
of
lots
of
other
peoples
keys
this
does
not
mean
your

are
similar
but
only
that
they
are
the
same
class
of

were
generated
with
the

are

pgp
is
another

pgp

and
works
somewhat
differently
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
in
any
way
though
pgp
does
also
use

a
few
major
differences
between
pgp
and
ripem
pgp
has
more
key
management
features
particularly
for
users
without
a
direct
network
connection
ripem
conforms
to
the
pem
rfcs
and
thus
has
a
greater
probability
of
working
with
other
pem
software
pgp
makes
no
attempt
to
be
compatible
with
anything
other
than

ripem
uses
rsaref
a
library
of
rsa
routines
from
rsadsi
which

pgp

pkp
claims
that
it
is
a
violation
of
its

to
make
use

sell
pgp
in

see
what
about
rsadsipkp
phil
zimmermann
the
author
of
pgp
stopped
distributing
it
after
being
threatened
with
legal
action
he
believed
that
a
licensing
scheme
could
be
arranged
but
it
hasnt
happened
and
there
seems
little
prospect
of
it
happening
in
the
future
he
acknowledges
in
the
pgp
users
guide
in
fact
if
you
live
in
the
usa
and
you
are
not
a
federal
agency
you
shouldnt
actually
run
pgp
on
your
computer
because
public

wants
to
forbid
you
from

my

pgp
is
contraband
both
pgp

ripem
are
exportrestricted

cannot
be

unfortunately
its

about
rpem
rpem
stands
for
rabin
privacy
enhanced

it
was
similar
to
ripem
but
used

publickey
cipher
invented
by
rabin
which
is
not
rsa
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
patents
on
publickey
systems
it
was
written
by
mark
riordan
who
later
wrote
ripem
its
distribution
was
halted
when
contrary
to
the
beliefs
of
many
including
rabin
pkp
claimed
that
their
patents
were
broad
enough
to
cover
the
cipher
employed
this
claim
is
not
universally
accepted
but
was
not
challenged
for
pragmatic
reasons
rpem
is
not
really
used
anymore
it
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
or
pgp
what
is
mime
mime
stands
for

it
does
not
go

is
almost
certainly
not

obviously
many
of
the

if
an
attacker
can
get
a
copy
of
your
private
keyfile
and
your
passphrase
by
snooping
network
packets
tapping
lines
or
whatever
he
could
break
the
whole
scheme
the
main
risk
is
that
of
transferring
either
the
passphrase
or
the
private
key
file
across
an
untrusted
link
so
dont
do
that
run
ripem
on
a
trusted
machine
preferably
one
sitting
right
in
front
of
you
ideally
your
own
machine
in
your
own
home
or
maybe
office
which
nobody
else
has
physical
access
to
fooling
you
into
accepting
a
bogus
public
key
for
someone
else
could
allow
an
opponent
to
deceive
you
into
sending
secret
messages
to
him
rather
than
to
the
real
recipient
if
the
enemy
can
fool
your
intended
recipient
as
well
he
could
reencrypt
the
messages
with
the
other
bogus
public
key
and
pass
them
along
it
is
important
to
get
the
proper
public
keys
of
other
people
the
most
common
mechanism
for
this
is
finger
assuming
the
opponent
has
not
compromised
routers
or
daemons
or
such
finger
can
be
given
a
fair
amount
of
trust
the
strongest
method
of
key
authentication
is
to
exchange
keys
in
person
however
this
is
not
always
practical
having
other
people
vouch
for
you
by
signing
a
statement
containing
your
key
is
possible
although
ripem
doesnt
have
features
for
doing
this
as
automatically
as
pgp
ripem
does
generate
and
check
fingerprints
of
public
keys
in
the
key
files
they
may
be
exchanged
via
a
separate
channel
for
authentication
playback
attacks
even
if
an
opponent
cannot
break
the
cryptography
an
opponent
could
still
cause
difficulties
for
example
suppose
you
send
a
message
with
miconly
a
pem
mode
which
does
not
provide
disclosure
protection
to
alice
which
says
ok
lets
do
that
your
opponent
intercepts
it
and
now
resends
it
to
bob
who
now
has
a
message
which
is
authenticated
as
from
you
telling
him
to
do
that
of
course
he
may
interpret
it
in
an
entirely
different
context
or
your
opponent
could
transmit
the
same
message
to
the
same
recipient
much
later
figuring
it
would
be
seen
differently
at
a
later
time
or
the
opponent
could
change
the
originatorname
to
himself
register
your
public
key
as
his
and
send
a
message
hoping
the
recipient
will
send
him
return
mail
indicating
perhaps
even
quoting
the
unknown
message
to
defeat
playback
attacks
the
plaintext
of
each
message
should
include
some
indication
of
the
sender
and
recipient
and
a
unique
identifier
typically
the
date
a
good
frontend
script
for
ripem
should
do
this
automatically
imho
as
a
recipient
you
should
be
sure
that
the
originatorname
header
and
the
sender
indicated
within
the
plaintext
are
the
same
that
you
really
are
a
recipient
and
that
the
message
is
not
an
old
one
some
this
also
can
and
should
be
automated
the
author
of
this
faq
has
made
a
modest
attempt
at
automating
the
process
of
generating
and
checking
encapsulated
headers
the
programs
are
included
in
the
standard
distribution
in
the
utils
directory
local
attacks
clearly
the
security
of
ripem
cannot
be
greater
than
the
security
of
the
machine
where
the
encryption
is
performed
for
example
under
unix
a
superuser
could
manage
to
get
at
your
encrypted
mail
although
it
would
take
some
planning
and
effort
to
do
something
like
replace
the
ripem
executable
with
a
trojan
horse
or
to
get
a
copy
of
the
plaintext
depending
how
its
stored
in
addition
the
link
between
you
and
the
machine
running
ripem
is
an
extension
of
that
if
you
decrypt
with
ripem
on
a
remote
machine
which
you
are
connected
to
via
network
or
worse
yet
modem
an
eavesdropper
could
see
the
plaintext
and
probably
also
your
passphrase
ripem
should
only
be
executed
on
systems
you
trust
obviously
in
the
extreme
case
ripem
should
only
be
used
on
your
own
machine
which
you
have
total
control
over
and
which
nobody
else
has
access
to
which
has
only
carefully
examined
software
known
to
be
free
of
viruses
and
so
on
however
theres
a
very
real
tradeoff
between
convenience
and
security
here
a
more
moderately
cautious
user
might
use
ripem
on
a
unix
workstation
where
other
people
have
access
even
root
access
but
increase
security
by
keeping
private
keys
and
the
statically
linked
of
course
executable
on
a
floppy
disk
some
people
will
keep
ripem
on
a
multiuser
system
but
when
dialing
in
over
an
insecure
line
they
will
download
the
message
to
their
own
system
and
perform
the
ripem
decryption
there
however
the
security
provided
by
such
a
mechanism
is
somewhat
illusory
since
you
presumably
type
your
cleartext
password
to
log
in
youve
just
given
away
the
store
since
the
attacker
can
now
log
in
as
you
and
install
traps
in
your
account
to
steal
your
private
key
next
time
you
use
it
from
a
less
insecure
line
this
will
likely
remain
the
situation
as
long
as
most
systems
use
the
rather
quaint
mechanism
of
cleartext
password
authentication
i
find
it
nice
to
put
a
brief
statement
of
how
carefully
i
manage
my
security
arrangement
in
my
plan
next
to
my
public
key
so
that
potential
correspondents
can
be
aware
what
level
of
precautions
are
in
place
some
people
use
two
keys
a
short
one
which
is
not
carefully
managed
for
ordinary
use
and
a
longer
one
which
is
treated
with
greater
care
for
critical
correspondence
untrusted
partner
attacks
ripems
encryption
will
ensure
that
only
a
person
with
the
private
key
corresponding
to
the
public
key
used
to
encrypt
the
data
may
read
the
traffic
however
once
someone
with
that
key
gets
the
message
she
may
always
make
whatever
kind
of
transformations
she
wishes
there
exist
no
cryptographic
barriers
to
a
recipient
say
taking
an
encrypted
message
and
converting
it
to
a
miconly
message
signed
by
you
and
readable
by
anyone
although
ripem
does
not
provide
this
functionality
indeed
the
latest
pem
draft
i
have
seen
specifically
states
that
such
transformations
should
be
possible
to
allow
forwarding
functions
to
work
including
the
recipients
in
the
plaintext
as
mentioned
above
will
make
it
possible
for
recipients
of
a
redistributed
message
to
be
aware
of
its
original
nature
naturally

the

clearing
of
magnetic
media
certain
types
of
removable
media
eg
magnetic
tape
floppy
disk
cassettes
and
magnetic
cards
may
be
cleared
by
overwriting
the
entire
media
one
time
with
any
one
character
floppy
disks
may
be
cleared
by
applying
a
vendors
formatting
program
that
overwrites
each
location
with
a
given
character
fixed
media
eg
winchester
disks
should
be
cleared
by
overwriting
at
least
one
time
with
any
one
character
one
way
to
do
this
is
by
applying
a
vendorsupplied
formatting
program
that
overwrites
each
location
on
the
disk
with
a
given
character
if
it
can
be
shown
that
this
program
actually
works
as
advertised
the
user
should
beware
some
programs
that
purport
to
overwrite
all
locations
do
not
actually
do
this
cleared
media
may
be
resides
within
the
controlled
facility
or
released
for

however
they
should
be
marked
and
controlled
at
the
level
of
the
most
restrictive
sensitivity
of
information
ever
recorded
declassification
of
magnetic
media
certain
types
of
removable
media
can
be
declassified
using
a
degaussing
device
that
has
been
approved
for
declassifying
media
of
that
type
a
list
of
approved
devices
is
maintained
by
the
nsa
if
a
fixed
medium
for
example
a
hard
or
winchester
disk
is
operative
an
approved
method
of
declassifying
the
disk
pack
is
to
employ
an
overwrite
procedure
which
must
overwrite
all
addressable
locations
at
least
three
times
by
writing
any
character
then
its
complement
eg
binary
ones
and
binary
zeros
alternatively
when
fixed
media
become
inoperative
it
is
impossible
to
declassify
the
media
by
the
overwrite
method
in
this
case
there
are
two
alternate
procedures
that
may
be
used
disassemble
the
disk
pack
and
degauss
each
platter
with
the
appropriate
approved
degaussing
equipment
and
courier
the
inoperative
media
to
the
vendors
facility
have
the
magnetic
media
eg
disk
platter
removed
in
sight
of
the
courier
and
returned
to
the
courier
for
destruction
at
the
secure
site
the
vendor
can
then
install
new
platters
and
repair

i
hate
to

my

but
i
should
perhaps
clarify
some
things
so
i
wont
get
flamed
first
of
all
when
im
talking
about
factoring
the
modulus
or
a
breakthrough
in
factoring
what
i
really
mean
is
a
breakthrough
in
the
cryptanalysis
of
rsa
i
know
that
factoring
and
breaking
rsa
are
not
proven
to
be
equivalent
its
just
so
damn
convenient
not
to
repeat
this
every
time
i
also
have
to
admit
that
i
dont
really
know
if
the
nongroup
property
of
a
cipher
is
essential
only
for
key
chaining
i
have
thought
about
it
a
little
while
but
i
cant
find
a
way
that
a
cryptanalyst
could
exploit
a
group
structure
that
of
course
means
nothing
at
all
then
i
wrote
please
note
that
as
long
as
it
is
much
harder
to
factor
a
rsa
modulus
than
it
is
to
generate
it
the
increase
in
computer
speed
alone
will
keep
key
lengths
and
modulus
factoring
in
lockstep
ie
people
will
simply
start
using
longer
moduli
and
still
be
safe
what
i
meant
was
that
as
long
as
the
only
advantage
of
the
cryptanalyst
is
a
faster
computer
then
we
will
probably
have
rsa
for
a
long
time
to
come
because
even
if
moduli
somehow
could
be
broken
with
fast
computers
not
with
a
new
algorithm
then
people
would
simply
use
longer
moduli
both
users
and
cryptanalysts
benefit
from
better
technology
in
the

way

this
keeps
the

this
thread
brings
up
the
more
general
question
can
any
crypto
implementation
for
which
highly
publicly
scrutinized
source
code
is
not
available
ever
be
trusted
after
ibm
had
invented
the
des
and
the
nbs
had
advertised
for
proposals
but
before
ibm
had
decided
to
respond
i
argued
strenuously
that
they
should
not
they
should
keep
it
proprietary
the
biggest
proponent
of
proposing
was
dr
lewis
branscomb
dr
branscomb
was
the
ibm
chief
scientist
and
had
come
to
ibm
from
nbs
fortunately
for
all
of
us
dr
branscomb
understood
the
answer
to
the
above
question
much
better
than
i
he
realized
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
gain
acceptance
for
any
cryptographic
mechanism
because
of
the
necessary
complexity
publicity
would
not
be
sufficient
and
neither
would
authority
in
fact
it
has
taken
both
of
those
plus
more
than
years
we
have
also
had
independence
the
des
was
solicited
by
nbs
invented
and
proposed
by
ibm
and
vetted
by
nbs
it
has
also
been
examined
and
vetted
by
experts
like
adi
shamir
who
are
not
subject
to
influence
by
any
of
these
even
now
there
are
still
people
posting
on
this
list
who
do
not
trust
the
des
in
spite
of
all
the
time
all
of
the
analysis
and
all
of
the
public
scrutiny
of
course
it
is
just
this
point
that
nist
misses
when
it
attempts
to
gain
acceptance
for
a
novel
mechanism
developed
in
secret
on
the
basis
of
authority
alone
we
had
a
long
thread
here
about
whether
or
not
the
nsa
can
break
the
des
that
is
a
silly
question
at
some
cost
and
in
some
time
they
can
break
anything
the
important
question
is
at
what
cost
and
in
what
time
the
fundamental
strength
of
the
des
and
rsa
are
not
nearly
so
important
as
what
we
know
about
their
strength
as
long
as
we
understand
the
cost
and
duration
for
an
attacker
then
we
can
use
them
in
a
safe
way
at
this
point
we
may
never
replace
either
because
of
the
inability
of
any
successor
to
overcome
this
knowledge
gap
des
and
rsa
are
among
the
most
significant
inventions
of
the
century
and
the
most
important
inventions
in
the
history
of

are

long
as
it
runs
in
a
system
where
the
user
cant
get
to
it
otherwise
you
cant
stop
him
from
finding
the
load
a
module
code
in
your
program
and
simply
bypassing
the
check
for
a
valid
module
the
devious
user
can
either
modify
the
object
code
before
running
the
program
or
he
can
run
the
program
under
a
debugger
and
change
the
instructions
in
memory
there
is
a
way
to
foil
debuggers
by
clearing
the
single
step
interrupt
on
which
a
debugger
depends
every
few
instructions
in
the
sensitive
areas
of
the
code
this
assumes
the
person
is
using
the
hardware
debug
instruction
of
an
type
processor
it
can
be
negated
by
noping
the
clear
debug
instruction
or
by
running
the
code
on
a
machine
simulator
like
one
i
wrote
as
a
senior
project
in
college
it
can
bypass
and
trace
practically
anything
one
could
write
in

it
is
apparently
quite
easy

persons
calling

pardon
me
but
isnt
this
very
illegal
i
was
under
the
impression
that
a
warrent
is
needed
to
get
this
information
out
of
the
phone
company
in
order
to
protect
peoples
privacy
legal
or
not
ive
seen
it
done
phone
records
were
obtained
in

establish
probable
cause
rather
than
as
a
result
of
it

a
local
worcester
ma
police
officer
i
spoke
with
only
a
couple
of
nights
ago
told
me
that
they
usually
only
subpeona
the
phone
companies
records
in
extreme
conditions
because
its
so
much
of
a
hassle
and
does
the
phone
company
require
written
subpoenaable
evidence
of
probable
cause
in
order
to
process
the
request
i
suggest
that
the
officer
was
disinterested
in
pursuing
your
case
even
if
you
could
prove
the
offender
had
called
you
at
a
certain
time
your
chances
of
winning
a
harassment
suit
on
the
strength
of
this
evidence
are
nil
my
contact
with
several
people
who
have
dealt
with
cases
of
extreme
phone
harassment
several
thousand
calls
in
one
case
teaches
me
that
police
in
this
area
are
quite
lethargic
about
pursuing
such
matters

need
if
you
think
about

theres
no
point
in
actually

because
it
just
gives
you
different
random
data
if
you
want
some

to
look

you
just
put

this
suggests
a

security
product
design
approach
first
fill
the
hard

with
random
files
and
files
encrypted
under
a
number
of
known
keys
then
whenever
a
new
secret
file

you
delete
a
random
file
and
replace
it
with
real
encrypted

new
nonsecret
files
are
encrypted
under
a
known
key
better
yet
instead
of
thrashing
around
on
the
dos
file
system
take
it
a
step
further
write
yourself
a
minimal
file
system
program
that
is
used
to
createdelete
files
endecrypt
them
to
ramdisk
list
a
directory
put
the
util
password
protected
on
a
floppy
the
catch
is
that
the
storage
space
used
by
this
util
is
not
part
of
the
dos
file
system
instead
defrag
your
disk
thus
packing
all
allocated
clusters
into
clusters
then
use
the
back
end
of
the
partition
to
hold
your
stealth
file
system
or
leave
a
small
partition
on
the
disk
that
is
not
assigned
to
dos
another
approach
might
be
to
use
a
directory
that
contains
a
set
of
invariant
files
dos
system
files
for
instance
due
to
dos
allocating
a
minimum
storage
unit
of
a
cluster
there
is
unused
physical
space
on
the
disk
between
the
tail
end
of
each
file
and
the
end
of
its
associated
cluster
these
dead
spaces
could
be
concatenated
and
used
to
hold
your
stealth
file
system
now
you
have
a
situation

no

suggests
that

the

what
is
identity
on
the
internet
generally
today
peoples
identity
on
the
internet
is
primarily
determined
by
their
email
address
in
the
sense
that
this
is
their
most
unchanging
face
in
the
electronic
realm
this
is
your
login
name
qualified
by
the
complete
address
domain
information
for
example
people
see
this
address
when
receiving
mail
or
reading
usenet
posts
from
you
and
in
other
situations
where
programs
record
usage
some
obsolete
forms
of
addresses
such
as
bitnet
still
persist
in
email
messages
additional
information
on
the
path
that
a
message
takes
is
prepended
to
the
message
received
by
the
recipient
this
information
identifies
the
chain
of
hosts
involved
in
the
transmission
and
is
a
very
accurate
trace
of
its
origination
this
type
of
identifyandforward
protocol
is
also
used
in
the
usenet
protocol
to
a
lesser
extent
forging
these
fields
requires
corrupted
mailing
software
at
sites
involved
in
the
forwarding
and
is
very
uncommon
not
so
uncommon
is
forging
the
chain
at
the
origination
point
so
that
all
initial
sites
in
the
list
are
faked
at
the
time
the
message
is
created
tracing
these
messages
can
be
difficult
or
impossible
when
the
initial
faked
fields
are
names
of
real
machines
and
represent
real
transfer
routes
why
is
identity
unimportant
on
the
internet
the
concept
of
identity
is
closely
intertwined
with
communication
privacy
and
security
which
in
turn
are
all
critical
aspects
of
computer
networks
for
example
the
convenience
of
communication
afforded
by
email
would
be
impossible
without
conventions
for
identification
but
there
are
many
potential
abuses
of
identity
possible
that
can
have
very
severe
consequences
with
massive
computer
networks
at
the
forefront
of
the
issue
which
can
potentially
either
exacerbate
or
solve
these
problems
verifying
that
an
identity
is
correct
is
called
authentication
and
one
classic
example
of
the
problems
associated
with
it
is
hgwells
war
of
the
worlds
radio
broadcast
that
fooled
segments
of
the
population
into
thinking
that
an
alien
invasion
was
in
progress
hoaxes
of
this
order
are
not
uncommon
on
usenet
and
forged
identities
makes
them
more
insidious
people
and
their
reputations
can
be
assaulted
by
forgery
however
the
fluidity
of
identity
on
the
internet
is
for
some
one
of
its
most
attractive
features
identity
is
just
as
useful
as
it
is
harmful
a
professor
might
carefully
explain
a
topic
until
he
finds
he
is
talking
to
an
undergraduate
a
person
of
a
particular
occupation
may
be
able
to
converse
with
others
who
might
normally
shun
him
some
prejudices
are
erased
but
on
the
other
hand
many
prejudices
are
useful
a
scientist
might
argue
he
can
better
evaluate
the
findings
of
a
paper
as
a
reviewer
if
he
knows
more
about
the
authors
likewise
he
may
be
more
likely
to
reject
it
based
on
unfair
or
irrelevant
criteria
on
the
other
side
of
the
connection
the
author
may
find
identities
of
reviewers
useful
in
exerting
pressure
for
acceptance
identity
is
especially
crucial
in
establishing
and
regulating
credit
not
necessarily
financial
and
ownership
and
usage
many
functions
in
society
demand
reliable
and
accurate
techniques
for
identification
heavy
reliance
will
be
placed
on
digital
authentication
as
global
economies
become
increasingly
electronic
many
government
functions
and
services
are
based
on
identification
and
law
enforcement
frequently
hinges
on
it
hence
employees
of
many
government
organizations
push
toward
stronger
identification
structures
but
when
does
identification
invade
privacy
the
growth
of
the
internet
is
provoking
social
forces
of
massive
proportions
decisions
made
now
on
issues
of
identity
will
affect
many
future
users
especially
as
the
network
becomes
increasingly
global
universal
widespread
and
entrenched
and
the
positive
or
adverse
affects
of
these
actions
intended
and
inadvertent
will
literally
be
magnified
exponentially
how
does
my
email
address
not
identify
me
and
my
background
your
email
address
may
contain
information
that
influences
peoples
perceptions
of
your
background
the
address
may
identify
you
as
from
a
department
at
a
particular
university
an
employee
at
a
company
or
a
government
worker
it
may
contain
your
last
name
initials
or
cryptic
identification
codes
independent
of
both
in
the
us
some
are
based
on
parts
of
social
security
numbers
others
are
in
the
form
where
the
number
is
incremented
in
the
order
that
new
users
are
added
to
the
system
standard
internet
addresses
also
can
contain
information
on
your
broad
geographical
location
or
nationhood
however
none
of
this
information
is
guaranteed
to
be
correct
or
be
there
at
all
the
fields
in
the
domain
qualification
of
the
username
are
based
on
rather
arbitrary
organization
such
as
mostly
invisible
network
cabling
distributions
the
only
point
to
make
is
that
early
fields
in
the
address
are
more
specific
such
as
specific
computer
names
or
local
networks
and
the
later
ones
the
most
general
such
as
continental
domains
typically
the
first
field
is
the
name
of
the
computer
receiving
mail
gleaning
information
from
the
email
address
alone
is
sometimes
an
inspired
art
or
an
inconsistent
and
futile
exercise

more
information

how
can
i
find
out
more
about
somebody
with
a
given
email
address
one
simple
way
is
to
send
email
to
that
address
asking
another
way
is
to
send
mail
to
the
postmaster
at
that
address
ie
postmasteraddress
although
the
postmasters
job
is
more
to
help
find
user
ids
of
particular
people
given
their
real
name
and
solve
mail
routing
problems
the
sysadmin
ie
rootaddress
may
also
be
able
to
supply
information
users
with
related
email
address
may
have
information
however
all
of
these
methods
rely
on
the
time
and
patience
of
others
so
use
them
minimally
one
of
the
most
basic
tools
for
determining
identity
over
the
internet
is
the
unix
utility
finger
the
basic
syntax
is
finger
userherethereeverywhere
this
utility
uses
communication
protocols
to
query
the
computer
named
in
the
address
for
information
on
the
user
named
the
response
is
generated
completely
by
the
receiving
computer
and
may
be
in
any
format
possible
responses
are
as
follows
a
message
unknown
host
meaning
some
aspect
of
the
address
is
incorrect
two
lines
with
no
information
and
a
message
in
real
life
in
which
case
the
receiving
computer
could
not
find
any
kind
of
a
match
on
the
username
the
finger
utility
may
return
this
response
in
other
situations
a
listing
of
information
associated
with
multiple
users
some
computers
will
search
only
for
matching
user
ids
others
will
attempt
to
find
the
username
you
specified
as
a
substring
of
all
actual
full
names
of
users
kept
in
a
local
database
at
some
sites
finger
can
be
used
to
get
a
list
of
all
users
on
the
system
with
a
finger
address
in
general
this
is
often
considered
weak
security
however
because
attackers
know
valid
user
ids
to
crack
passwords
more
information
on
the
fields
returned
by
finger
is
given
below
more
information
on
finger
and
locating
peoples
email
addresses
is
given
in
the
email
faq
such
as
the
whois
lookup
utility
just
as
you
can
use
these
means
to
find
out
about
others
they
can
use
them
to
find
out
about
you
you
can
finger
yourself
to
find
out
what
is
publicly
reported
by
your
unix
system
about
you
be
careful
when
modifying
finger
data
virtually
anyone
with
internet
access
worldwide
can
query
this
information
in
one
amazing
case
the

uncovered
the

of
r

see

why
is
identification
unstable
on
the
internet
generally
identity
is
an
amorphous
and
almost
nonexistent
concept
on
the
internet
for
a
variety
of
reasons
one
is
the
inherent
fluidity
of
cyberspace
where
people
emerge
and
submerge
frequently
and
absences
are
not
readily
noted
in
the
community
most
people
remember
faces
and
voices
the
primary
means
of
casual
identification
in
the
real
world
the
arbitary
and
cryptic
sequences
of
letters
and
digits
comprising
most
email
addresses
are
not
particularly
noticeable
or
memorable
and
far
from
a
unique
identification
of
an
individual
who
may
use
multiple
accounts
on
multiple
machines
anywhere
in
the
world
currently
internet
users
do
not
really
have
any
great
assurances
that
the
messages
in
email
and
usenet
are
from
who
they
appear
to
be
a
persons
mailing
address
is
far
from
an
identification
of
an
individual
anyone
with
access
to
the
account
eg
they
know
the
password
either
legitimately
or
otherwise
can
send
mail
with
that
address
in
the
from
line
email
addresses
for
an
individual
tend
to
change
frequently
as
they
switch
jobs
or
make
moves
inside
their
organizations
as
part
of
current
mailing
protocol
standards
forging
the
from
line
in
mail
messages
is
a
fairly
trivial
operation
for
many
hackers
the
status
and
path
information
prepended
to
messages
by
intermediate
hosts
is
generally
unforgeable
in
general
while
possible
forgeries
are
fairly
rare
on
most
newsgroups
and
in
email
besides
these
pathological
cases
abve
there
are
many
basic
problems
with
todays
internet
protocols
affecting
identification
on
the
internet
internet
mail
standards
described
in
are
still
evolving
rapidly
and
not
entirely
orderly
for
example
standards
for
mail
address
munging
or
parsing
tend
to
vary
slightly
between
sites
and
frequently
mean
the
difference
between
finding
addresses
and
bouncing
mail
domain
names
and
computer
names
are
frequently
changed
at
sites
and
there
are
delays
in
the
propagation
of
this
data
addresses
cannot
be
resolved
when
certain
critical
computers
crash
such
as
the
receiving
computer
or
other
computers
involved
in
resolving
names
into
addresses
called
nameservers
a
whole
slew
of
problems
is
associated
with
nameservers
if
they
are
not
updated
they
will
not
find
name
addresses
and
even
the
operation
of
what
constitutes
updating
has
different
interpretations
at
different
sites
the
current
internet
mailing
and
addressing
protocols
are
slightly
anachronistic
in
that
they
were
created
when
the
network
was
somewhat
obscure
and
not
widespread
with
only
a
fraction
of
the
traffic
it
now
sees
today
a
large
proportion
of
internet
traffic
is
email
comprising
millions
of
messages
what
is
the
future
of
identification
on
the
internet
some
new
technologies
and
standards
are
introducing
facial
images
and
voice
messages
into
mail
and
these
will
improve
the
sense
of
community
that
comes
from
the
familiarity
of
identification
however
they
are
not
currently
widespread
require
large
amounts
of
data
transfer
standardized
software
and
make
some
compromises
in
privacy
promising
new
cryptographic
techniques
may
make
digital
signatures
and
digital
authentication
common
see
below
also
the
trend
in
usenet
standards
is
toward
greater
authentication
of
posted
information
on
the
other
hand
advances
in
ensuring
anonymity

privacy
what
is
privacy
on
the
internet
generally
while
privacy
has
multiple
connotations
in
society
and
perhaps
even
more
on
the
internet
in
cyberspace
most
take
it
to
mean
that
you
have
exclusive
use
and
access
to
your
account
and
the
data
stored
on
and
and
directed
to
it
such
as
email
and
you
do
not
encounter
arbitrary
restrictions
or
searches
in
other
words
others
may
obtain
data
associated
with
your
account
but
not
without
your
permission
these
ideas
are
probably
both
fairly
limiting
and
liberal
in
their
scope
in
what
most
internet
users
consider
their
private
domains
some
users
dont
expect
or
want
any
privacy
some
expect
and
demand
it
why
is
privacy
unimportant
on
the
internet
this
is
a
somewhat
debatable
and
inflammatory
topic
arousing
passionate
opinions
on
the
internet
some
take
privacy
for
granted
and
are
rudely
surprised
to
find
it
tenuous
or
nonexistent
most
governments
have
rules
that
protect
privacy
such
as
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
clause
of
the
us
constitution
adopted
by
others
but
have
many
that
are
antithetical
to
it
such
as
laws
prohibiting
secret
communications
or
allowing
wiretapping
these
rules
generally
carry
over
to
the
internet
with
few
specific
rules
governing
it
however
the
legal
repercussions
of
the
global
internet
are
still
largely
unknown
and
untested
ie
no
strong
legal
precedents
and
court
cases
the
fact
that
internet
traffic
frequently
passes
past
international
boundaries
and
is
not
centrally
managed
significantly
complicates
and
strongly
discourages
its
regulation
how
insecure
are
internet
networks
theoretically
people
at
any
site
in
the
chain
of
sites
with
access
to
hardware
and
network
media
that
transmits
data
over
the
internet
could
potentially
monitor
or
archive
it
however
the
sheer
volume
and
general
noise
inherent
to
this
data
makes
these
scenarios
highly
improbable
even
by
government
agencies
with
supposedly
vast
funding
and
resources
technologies
exist
to
tap
magnetic
fields
given
off
by
electrical
wires
without
detection
less
obscurely
any
machine
with
a
network
connection
is
a
potential
station
for
traffic
detection
but
this
scenario
requires
knowledge
and
access
to
very
lowlevel
hardware
the
network
card
to
pursue
if
even
possible
a
company
network
general
inc
is
one
of
many
that
manufactures
and
markets
sophisticated
network
monitoring
tools
that
can
filter
and
read
packets
by
arbitrary
criteria
for
troubleshooting
purposes
but
the
cost
of
this
type
of
device
is
prohibitive
for
casual
use
known
instances
of
the
above
types
of
security
breaches
at
a
major
scale
such
as
at
network
hubs
are
very
rare
the
greatest
risks
tend
to
emerge
locally
note
that
all
these
approaches
are
almost
completely
defused
with
the
use
of
cryptography
how
insecure
is
my
account
by
default
not
very
there
are
a
multitude
of
factors
that
may
reinforce
or
compromise
aspects
of
your
privacy
on
the
internet
first
your
account
must
be
secure
from
other
users
the
universal
system
is
to
use
a
password
but
if
it
is
weak
ie
easy
to
guess
this
security
is
significantly
diminished
somewhat
surprisingly
and
frighteningly
to
some
certain
users
of
the
system
particularly
the
administrator
generally
have
unlimited
access
regardless
of
passwords
and
may
grant
that
access
to
others
this
means
that
they
may
read
any
file
in
your
account
without
detection
furthermore
not
universally
known
most
unix
systems
keep
fairly
extensive
accounting
records
of
when
and
where
you
logged
in
what
commands
you
execute
and
when
they
are
executed
in
fact
login
information
is
usually
public
most
features
of
this
auditing
or
process
accounting
information
are
enabled
by
default
after
the
initial
installation
and
the
system
administrator
may
customize
it
to
strengthen
or
weaken
it
to
satisfy
performance
or
privacy
aims
this
information
is
frequently
consulted
for
troubleshooting
purposes
and
may
otherwise
be
ignored
this
data
tracks
unsuccessful
login
attempts
and
other
suspicious
activities
on
the
system
a
traditional
part
of
the
unix
system
that
tracks
user
commands
is
easily
circumvented
by
the
user
with
the
use
of
symbolic
links
described
in
man
ln
unix
implementations
vary
widely
particularly
in
tracking
features
and
new
sophisticated
mechanisms
are
introduced
by
companies
regularly
typically
system
adminstrators
augment
the
basic
unix
functionality
with
publicdomain
programs
and
locallydeveloped
tools
for
monitoring
and
use
them
only
to
isolate
suspicious
activity
as
it
arises
eg
remote
accesses
to
the
passwd
file
incorrect
login
attempts
remote
connection
attempts
etc
generally
you
should
expect
little
privacy
on
your
account
for
various
reasons
potentially
every
keystroke
you
type
could
be
intercepted
by
someone
else
system
administrators
make
extensive
backups
that
are
completely
invisible
to
users
which
may
record
the
states
of
an
account
over
many
weeks
erased
files
can
under
many
operating
systems
be
undeleted
most
automated
services
keep
logs
of
use
for
troubleshooting
or
otherwise
for
example
ftp
sites
usually
log
the
commands
and
record
the
domain
originations
of
users
including
anonymous
ones
some
software
exacerbates
these
problems
see

a
much
more
commonly
harmful
threat
there
are
multiple
ways
to
help
ensure
that
your
account
will
not
be
accessed
by
others
and
compromises
can
often
be
traced
to
failures
in
these
guidelines
choose
a
secure
password
change
it
periodically
make

always
do
not
leave
a

unattended
for

make

no
one
watches
you
when

avoid
password
references
in

be
conservative
in
the
use
of
the
rhost
file
use
utilities
like
xlock
to
protect
a
station
but
be
considerate
be
wary
of
situations
where
you
think
you
should
supply
your
password
there
are
only
several
basic
situations
where
unix
prompts
you
for
a
password
when
you
are
logging
in
to
a
system
or
changing
your
password
situations
can
arise
in
which
prompts
for
passwords
are
forged
by
other
users
especially
in
cases
where
you
are
talking
to
them
such
as
internet
relay
chat
also
be
aware
that
forged

screens
are
one
method
to
illegitimately

how
insecure
are
my
files
and

the
most
important
privacy
considerations
are
related
to
file
rights
and
many
lapses
can
be
traced
to
their
misunderstood
nature
or
haphazard
maintenance
be
aware
of
the
rights
associated
with
your
files
and
directories
in
unix
if
the
x
execute
right
on
your
parent
directory
is
off
for
users
groups
and
other
these
users
cannot
gain
information
on
anything
in
your
directories
anything
less
may
allow
others
to
read
change
or
even
delete
files
in
your
home
directory
the
rights
on
a
directory
supersede
the
rights
associated
with
files
in
that
directory
for
a
directory
x
means
that
access
to
the
files
or
subdirectories
in
the
directory
is
possible
if
you
know
their
names
to
list
the
contents
of
the

however
requires
the
r
right
by
default
most
accounts
are
accessable
only
to
the
owner
but
the
initial
configuration
varies
between
sites
based
on
administrator
preference
the
default
file
mode
specifies
the
initial

associated
with
newly

can
be
set

how

windows
x
windows
is
the
primary
software
developed
by
the
mit
athena
project
which
is
funded
by
us
government
grants
to
develop
applications
to
harness
the
power
of
networks
in
enhancing
computational
tasks
particularly
the
humancomputer
interface
the
software
implements
a
clientserver
interface
to
a
computer
via
graphical
windows
in
this
case
the
client
is
the
application
requesting
or
utilizing
graphical
resources
such
as
windows
or
a
mouse
and
the
server
is
the
machine
that
provides
them
in
many
situations
the
client
is
an
application
program
running
on
the
same
machine
as
the
server
the
great
utility
of
x
windows
comes
from
its
complete
dissociation
of
the
client
and
server
so
that
windows
may
be
broadcast
to
a
server
at
a
remote
location
from
the
client
unfortunately
this
dynamic
power
also
introduces
many
deep
intricate
and
complicated
security
considerations
the
primary
security
and
privacy
issue
associated
with
x
windows
is
that
much
more
sensitive
data
may
be
sent
over
a
network
and
over
wider
regions
than
in
the
case
where
the
human
is
situated
near
the
host
computer
currently
there
is
no
encryption
of
data
such
as
screen
updates
and
keystrokes
in
x
windows
due
to
either
intentional
design
decisions
or
unintentional
design
flaws
early
versions
of
the
x
window
system
are
extremely
insecure
anyone
with
an
account
on
the
server
machine
can
disrupt
that
display
or
read
it
electronically
based
on
access
to
the
device
by
any
regular
user
there
are
no
protections
from
this
type
of
access
in
these
versions
the
problem
arises
because
the
security
is
completely
based
on
machine
addresses
rather
than
users
such

how
insecure
is
my
email
by

not
very
the
characters
that
you
are
reading
are
almost
certainly
encoded
in
ascii
the
american
standard
code
for
information
interchange
that
maps
alphabetic
and
symbolic
characters
onto
numeric
codes
and
vice
versa
virtually
every
computer
system
uses
this
code
and
if
not
has
ways
of
converting
to
and
from
it
when
you
write
a
mail
message
by
default
it
is
being
sent
in
ascii
and
since
the
standard
is
virtually
universal
there
is
no
intrinsic
privacy
despite
milleniums
worth
of
accumulated
cryptographic
knowledge
cryptographic
technologies
are
only
recently
being
established
that
afford
high
priority
to
privacy
as
a
primary
criteria
in
computer
and
network
design
some
potential
pitfalls
in
privacy
are
as
follows
the
most
serious
threats
are
instances
of
immature
or
unscrupulous
system
operators
reading
private
mail
in
the
spool
files
at
a
local
site
ie
at
the
source
or
destination
of
the
message
such
as
a
university
system
administrators
may
also
release
files
to
law
enforcement
agencies
but
conventions
and
protocols
for
warrants
involving
computer
searches
have
still
not
been
strongly
established
and
tested
legally
note
that
bounced
messages
go
to
postmasters
at
a
given
site
in
their
entirety
this
means
that
if
you
address
mail
with
an
incorrect
address
it
has
a
good
chance
of
being
seen
by
a
human
other
than
the
recipient
typically
new
user
accounts
are
always
set
up
such
that
the
local
mail
directory
is
private
but
this
is
not
guaranteed
and
can
be
overridden
finally
be
aware
that
some
mailing
lists
email
addresses
of
everyone
on
a
list
are
actually
publicly
accessable
via
mail
routing
software
mechanisms
this
feature
can
be
disabled
most
potential
compromises
in
email
privacy
can
be
thoroughly
avoided
with
the
use
of
strong
endtoend
cryptography
which
has
its
own
set
of
caveats
for
example
unscrupulous
administrators
may
still
be
a
threat
if
the
encryption
site
is
shared
or
nonlocal
see

or
generally
any
subset
of

available
from

this
all
is
completely
at
the
discretion
of
the
local
administrator
and
under
the
procedures
followed
at
a
particular
site
which
in
many
cases
are
haphazard
and
crisisoriented
currently
there
are
virtually
no
widespread
uniform
guidelines
or
procedures
for
restricting
use
to
any
internet
services
and
local
administrators
are
free
to
make
arbitrary
decisions
on
access
today
punitive
measures
are
regularly
applied
in
various
situations
in
the
typical
scenario
complaints
reach
a
system
adminstrator
regarding
abuses
by
a
user
usually
but
not
necessarily
preceded
by
complaints
to
the
user
in
email
regarding
that
persons
objectionable
email
or
postings
abusive
posters
to
usenet
are
usually
first
given
admonitions
from
their
system
administrators
as
urged
by
others
on
the
net
the
debate
persists
endlessly
on
many
newsgroups
whether
this
is
also
used
as
a
questionable
means
of
attacking
or
silencing
harmless
crackpots
or
censoring
unpopular
opinions
system
administrators
at
remote
sites
regularly
cooperate
to
squelch
severe
cases
of
abuse
in
general
however
by
tradition
usenet
readers
are
remarkably
tolerant
of
diverse
views
and
uses
of
the
system
but
a
colorful
vocabularly
of
slang
helps
describe
their
alternatives
when
this
patience
is
sapped
the
options
wielded
by
the
individual
user
are
to
simply
advance
to
the
next

referred
to
as

key
or
to

in
cases
where
punitive
actions
are
applied
generally
system
administrators
are
least
likely
to
restrict
email
usenet
postings
are
much
more
commonly
restricted
either
to
individual
users
or
entire
groups
such
as
a
university
campus
restrictions
are
most
commonly
associated
with
the
following
abuses
harassing

threatening
notes
email
terrorism
illegal
uses
eg
piracy
or
propagation
of
copyrighted

ad

vulgarity
and
offensiveness
inappropriate
postings
esp
binary

in
regular

with
numerous

major
problems
originate
from
lack
of
distinctions
in

and
official
email
or
postings
most
users
have
internet
access
via
accounts
at
businesses
or
universities
and
their
activities
on
the

can
be
construed
as
representative
of
their

people
put

is
to
ask

such
as
your

you

is
possible

to

the

and
thereby
access
to

on

vary
widely
between

and
are
sometimes
frighteningly
lax
especially
at
universities
many

are
largely
managed
by
undergraduates
with
a
background
in
computing
and
often

administrators
sometimes
employ

or
unusual

which
can
potentially
be
misused
why
is
privacy
unstable
on
the
internet
for
the
numerous
reasons
listed
above
privacy
should
not
be
an
expectation
with
current
use
of
the
internet
furthermore
large
parts
of
the
internet
are
funded
by
the
us
nsf
national
science
foundation
which
places
certain
restrictions
on
its
use
such
as
prohibiting
commercial
use
some
highlevel
officials
in
this
and
other
government
agencies
may
be
opposed
to
emerging
techniques
to
guarantee
privacy
such
as
encryption
and
anonymous
services
historically
the
major
threats
to
privacy
on
the
internet
have
been
local
perhaps
the
most
common
example
of
this
are
the
widespread
occurrences
of
university
administrators
refusing
to
carry
some
portion
of
usenet
newsgroups
labelled
as
pornographic
the
alternative
hierarchy
in
the
usenet
system
which
has
virtually
no
restrictions
on
propagation
and
new
group
creation
is
frequently
targeted
although
this
material
may
appear
anywhere
from
the
global
point
of
view
traffic
is
generally
completely
unimpeded
on
the
internet
and
only
the
most
egregious
offenders
are
pursued
for
example
verbatim
transcriptions
of
copyrighted
material
such
as
newspaper
or
magazine
articles
are
posted
to
usenet
with
regularity
without
major
consequences
some
email
complaints
may
ensue
more
astonishing
to
some
is
that
currently
significant
portions
of
usenet
traffic
and
less
so
internet
traffic
is
comprised
of
sexuallyexplicit
digitized
images
almost
entirely
originating
from
copyrighted
material
newsgroups
such
as
altsex
regularly
have
the
highest
traffic
what
is
the
future
of
privacy
on
the
internet
some
argue
that
the
internet
currently
has
an
adequate
or
appropriate
level
of
privacy
others
will
argue
that
as
a
prototype
for
future
global
networks
it
has
woefully
inadequate
safeguards
the
internet
is
growing
to
become
a
completely
global
international
superhighway
for
data
and
this
traffic
will
inevitably
entail
data
such
as
voice
messages
postal
mail
and
many
other
items
of
extremely
personal
nature
computer
items
that
many
people
consider
completely
private
such
as
their
local
hard
drives
will
literally
be
inches
from
global
network
connections
also
sensitive
industrial
and
business
information
is
exchanged
over
networks
currently
and
this
volume
may
conceivably
merge
with
the
internet
most
would
agree
that
for
these
basic
but
sensitive
uses
of
the
internet
no
significant
mechanisms
are
currently
in
place
to
ensure
much
privacy
new
standards
are
calling
for
uniform
introduction
of
privacy
enhanced
mail
pem
which
uses
encryption
technologies
to
ensure
privacy
so
that
privacy
protection
is
automatic
and
may
significantly
improve
safeguards
the
same
technology
that
can
be
extremely
destructive
to
privacy
such
as
with
surreptitious
surveilance
can
be
overwhelmingly
effective
in
protecting
it
eg
with
encryption
some
government
agencies
are
opposed
to
unlimited
privacy
in
general
and
believe
that
it
should
lawfully
be
forfeited
in
cases
of
criminal
conduct
eg
courtauthorized
wiretapping
however
powerful
new
technologies
to
protect
privacy
on
computers
are
becoming
increasingly
popular
provoking
some
to
say
that
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
and
the
genie
cant
be
put
back
in
the
bottle
in
less
idiomatic
terms
they
believe
that
the
spread
of
strong
cryptography
is
already
underway
will
be
socially
and
technically
unstoppable
to
date
no
feasible
system
that
guarantees
both
secure
communication
and
government
oversight
has
been
proposed
the
two
goals
are
largely
incompatible
proposals
for
registration
of
secret
keys
by
d
denning
on
scicrypt
for
example
have
been
met
with
hot
controversy
at
best
and
ridicule
and
derision
at
worst
mainly
because
of
concerns
for
the
right
to
privacy
and
objections
of
inherent
feasibility
electronic
privacy
issues
and
particularly
the
proper
roles
of
networks
and
the
internet
will
foreseeably
become
highly
visible
and
explosive
over
the
next
few
years
anonymity
what
is
anonymity
on
the
internet
simply
stated
anonymity
is
the
absence
of
identity
the
ultimate
in
privacy
however
there
are
several
variations
on
this
simple
theme
a
person
may
wish
to
be
consistently
identified
by
a
certain
pseudonym
or
handle
and
establish
a
reputation
under
it
in
some
area
providing
pseudoanonymity
a
person
may
wish
to
be
completely
untraceable
for
a
single
oneway
message
a
sort
of
hitandrun
or
a
person
may
wish
to
be
openly
anonymous
but
carry
on
a
conversation
with
others
with
either
known
or
anonymous
identities
via
an
anonymous
return
address
a
user
may
wish
to
appear
as
a
regular
user
but
actually
be
untraceable
sometimes
a
user
wishes
to
hide
who
he
is
sending
mail
to
in
addition
to
the
message
itself
the
anonymous
item
itself
may
be
directed
at
individuals
or
groups
a
user
may
wish
to
access
some
service
and
hide
all
signs
of
the
association
all
of
these
uses
are
feasible
on
the
internet
but
are
currently
tricky
to
carry
out
in
practice
because
of
all
the
tracking
mechanisms
inherent
to
operating
systems
and
network
protocols
officials
of
the
nsf
and
other
government
agencies
may
be
opposed
to
any
of
these
uses
because
of
the
potential
for
abuse
nevertheless
the
inherent
facelessness
of
large
networks
will
always
guarantee
a
certain
element
of
anonymity
why
is
anonymity
unimportant
on
the
internet
anonymity
is
another
powerful
tool
that
can
be
beneficial
or
problematic
depending
on
its
use
arguably
absence
of
identification
is
important
as
the
presence
of
it
it
may
be
the
case
that
many
strong
benefits
from
electronic
anonymity
will
be
discovered
that
were
unforeseen
and
unpredicted
because
true
anonymity
has
been
historically
very
difficult
to
establish
one
can
use
anonymity
to
make
personal
statements
to
a
colleague
that
would
sabotage
a
relationship
if
stated
openly
such
as
employeremployee
scenarios
one
can
use
it
to
pass
information
and
evade
any
threat
of
direct
retribution
for
example
whistleblowers
reporting
on
government
abuses
economic
social
or
political
can
bring
issues
to
light
without
fear
of
stigma
or
retaliation
sensitive
personal
potentially
damaging
information
is
often
posted
to
some
usenet
groups
a
risky
situation
where
anonymity
allows
conversations
to
be
carried
on
completely
independent
of
the
identities
of
the
participants
some
police
departments
run
phone
services
that
allow
anonymous
reporting
of
crimes
such
uses
would
be
straightforward
on
the
network
unfortunately
extortion
and
harassment
become
more
insidious
with
assurances
of
anonymity
how
can
anonymity
be
protected
on
the
internet
the
chief
means
as
alluded
to
above
are
masking
identities
in
email
and
posting
however
anonymous
accounts
public
accounts
as
accessable
and
anonymous
as
eg
public
telephones
may
be
effective
as
well
but
this
use
is
generally
not
officially
supported
and
even
discouraged
by
some
system
adminstrators
and
nsf
guidelines
the
nonuniformity
in
the
requirements
of
obtaining
accounts
at
different
sites
and
institutions
makes
anonymous
accounts
generally
difficult
to
obtain
to
the
public
at
large
many
communications
protocols
are
inherently
detrimental
to
anonymity
virtually
every
protocol
in
existence
currently
contains
information
on
both
sender
and
receiver
in
every
packet
new
communications
protocols
will
likely
develop
that
guarantee
much
higher
degrees
of
secure
anonymous
communication
what
is
anonymous
mail
one
approach
to
anonymizing
mail
has
been
to
set
up
an
anonymous
server
that
when
activated
by
email
to
its
address
responds
by
allocating
and
supplying
an
anonymous
id
that
is
unique
to
the
person
requesting
it
based
on
his
email
address
this
will
vary
for
the
same
person
for
different
machine
address
email
originations
to
send
anonymous
mail
the
user
sends
email
directed
to
the
server
containing
the
final
destination
the
server
anonymizes
the
message
by
stripping
of
identification
information
and
forwards
the
message
which
appears
to
originate
from
the
anonymous
server
only
from
the
corresponding
anonymous
user
id
this
is
the
interactive
use
of
anonymity
or
pseudonymity
mentioned
above
another
more
fringe
approach
is
to
run
a
cypherpunk
remailer
from
a
regular
user
account
no
root
system
privileges
are
required
these
are
currently
being
pioneered
by
eric
hughes
and
hal
finney
halalumnicaltechedu
the
operator
runs
a
process
on
a
machine
that
anonymizes
mail
sent
to
him
with
certain
characteristics
that
distinguish
it
from
his
regular
incoming
mail
typically
fields
in
the
header
one
has
been
implemented
as
a
perl
script
running
on
unix
several
of
these
are
in
existence
currently
but
sites
and
software
currently
are
highly
unstable
they
may
be
in
operation
outside
of
system
administrator
knowledge
the
remailers
dont
generally
support
anonymous
return
addresses
mail
that
is
incorrectly
addressed
is
received
by
the
operator
generally
the
user
of
the
remailer
has
to
disavow
any
responsibility
for
the
messages
forwarded
through
his
system
although
actually
may
be
held
liable
regardless
these
approaches
have
several
serious
disadvantages
and
weaknesses
the
anonymous
server
approach
requires
maintaining
a
mapping
of
anonymous
ids
to
real
addresses
that
must
be
maintained
indefinitely
one
alternative
is
to
allow
deallocation
of
aliases
at
the
request
of
the
user
but
this
has
not
been
implemented
yet
although
an
unlikely
scenario
traffic
to
any
of
these
sites
could
conceivably
be
monitored
from
the
outside
necessitating
the
use
of
cryptography
for
basic
protection
local
administrators
can
shut
them
down
either
out
of
caprice
or
under
pressure
from
local
network
or
government
agencies
unscrupulous
providers
of
the
services
can
monitor
the
traffic
that
goes
through
them
most
remailers
currently
keep
logs
that
may
be
inspected
the
cypherpunk
approach
tends
to
be
highly
unstable
because
these
operators
are
basically
network
users
who
do
not
own
the
equipment
and
are
accountable
to
their
own
system
administrators
who
may
be
unaware
of
the
use
and
unsympathetic
to
the
philosophy
of
anonymity
when
the
operation
is
discovered
regarding
it
as
illicit
use
in
all
cases
a
high
degree
of
trust
is
placed
in
the
anonymous
server
operator
by
the
user
currently
the
most
direct
route
to
anonymity
involves
using
smtp
protocols
to
submit
a
message
directly
to
a
server
with
arbitrary
field
information
this
practice
not
uncommon
to
hackers
and
the
approach
used
by
remailers
is
generally
viewed
with
hostility
by
most
system
administrators
information
in
the
header
routing
data
and
logs
of
network
port
connection
information
may
be
retained
that
can
be
used
to
track
the
originating
site
in
practice
this
is
generally
infeasible
and
rarely
carried
out
some
administrators
on
the
network
will
contact
local
administrators
to
request
a
message
be
tracked
and
its
writer
admonished
or
punished
more
severely
such
as
revoking
the
account
all
of
this
actually
happening
occasionally
but
infrequently
see
the
sections
known
anonymous
mail
and
posting
sites
and
responsibilities
associated
with
anonymity
what
is
anonymous
posting
anonymous
servers
have
been
established
as
well
for
anonymous
usenet
posting
with
all
the
associated
caveats
above
monitored
traffic
capricious
or
risky
local
circumstances
logging
make
sure
to
test
the
system
at
least
once
by
eg
anonymous
posting
to
misctest
however
some
operators
dont
recommend
this
because
many
sites
autorespond
to
test
messages
possibly
causing
the
anonymous
server
to
allocate
anonymous
ids
for
those
machines
see
the
responsibilties
associated
with
anonymous
posting
before
proceeding
another
direct
route
involves
using
nntp
protocols
to
submit
a
message
directly
to
a
newserver
with
arbitrary
field
information
this
practice
not
uncommon
to
hackers
is
also
generally
viewed
with
hostility
by
most
system
administrators
and
similar
consequences
can
ensue
see
the
sections
known
anonymous
mail
and
posting
sites
and
responsibilities
associated
with
anonymity
why
is
anonymity
unstable
on
the
internet
as
noted
many
factors
compromise
the
anonymity
currently
available
to
the
general
internet
community
and
these
services
should
be
used
with
great
caution
to
summarize
the
technology
is
in
its
infancy
and
current
approaches
are
unrefined
unreliable
and
not
completely
trustworthy
no
standards
have
been
established
and
troubling
situations
of
loss
of
anonymity
and
bugs
in
the
software
are
prevalent
here
are
some
encountered
and
potential
bugs
one
anonymous
remailer
reallocated
already
allocated
anonymous
return
addresses
others
passed
signature
information
embedded
in
messages
unaltered
address
resolution
problems
resulting
in
anonymized
mail
bounced
to
a
remailer
are
common
forgeries
to
the
anonymous
server
itself
are
a
problem
possibly
allowing
unauthorized
users
to
potentially
glean
anon
id
email
address
mappings
in
the
alias
file
this
can
be
remedied
with
the
use
of
passwords
infinite
mail
loops
are
possible
with
chaining
remailers
source
code
is
being
distributed
tested
and
refined
for
these
systems
but
standards
are
progressing
slowly
and
weakly
the
field
is
not
likely
to
improve
considerably
without
official
endorsement
and
action
by
network
agencies
the
whole
idea
is
essentially
still
in
its
infancy
and
viewed
with
suspicion
and
distrust
by
many
on
the
internet
seen
as
illegitimate
or
favorable
to
criminality
the
major
objection
to
anonymity
over
regular
internet
use
is
the
perceived
lack
of
accountability
to
system
operators
ie
invulnerability
to
account
restrictions
resulting
from
outside
complaints
system
adminstrators
at
some
sites
have
threatened
to
filter
anonymous
news
postings
generated
by
the
prominent
servers
from
their
redistribution
flows
this
may
only
have
the
effect
of
encouraging
server
operators
to
create
less
characteristically
detectable
headers
probably
the
least
problematic
approach
and
the
most
traditional
to
usenet
is
for
individual
users
to
deal
with
anonymous
mail
however
they
prefer
eg
ignoring
it
or
filtering
it
with
kill
files
what
is
the
future
of
anonymity
on
the
internet
new
anonymous
protocols
effectively
serve
to
significantly
increase
safeguards
of
anonymity
for
example
the
same
mechanism
that
routes
email
over
multiple
hosts
thereby
threatening
its
privacy
can
also
be
used
to
guarantee
it
in
a
scheme
called
chaining
an
anonymous
message
is
passed
through
multiple
anonymous
servers
before
reaching
a
destination
in
this
way
generally
multiple
links
of
the
chain
have
to
be
broken
for
security
to
be
compromised
reencryption
at
each
link
makes
this
scenario
even
more
unlikely
even
more
significantly
the
anonymous
remailers
could
be
spread
over
the
internet
globally
so
that
local
weaknesses
such
as
corrupt
governments
or
legal
wiretapping
within
a
nation
would
be
more
unlikely
to
sacrifice
overall
security
by
message
tracing
however
remailers
run
by
corrupt
operators
are
possible
the
future
of
anonymous
services
on
the
internet
is
at
this
time
highly
uncertain
and
fraught
with
peril
while
specific
groups
seem
to
benefit
significantly
from
anonymous
posting
capabilities
many
feel
that
unlimited
newsgroup
scope
for
anonymous
posting
is
a
disruptive
and
dangerous
idea
and
detracts
from
discussions
in
serious
groups
the
introduction
of
unlimited
group
anonymity
may
have
fundamental
repercussions
on
usenet
conventions
and
distribution
mechanisms
such
as
moderated
and
alt
groups
have
had
in
the
past
for
example
as
part
of
new
group
creation
the
charter
may
specify
whether
anonymous
posting
is
unwelcome
nevertheless
the
widespread
introduction
and
use
of
anonymity
may
be
inevitable
based
on
traffic
statistics
anonymous
services
are
in
huge
demand
pervasive
and
readily
available
anonymity
could
carry
significant
and
unforeseen
social
consequences
however
if
its
use
is
continued
to
be
generally
regarded
as
subversive
it
may
be
confined
to
the
underground
the
ramifications
of
widespread
introduction
of
anonymity
to
usenet
are
still
largely
unknown
it
is
unclear
whether
it
will
provoke
signficant
amounts
of
new
traffic
or
instead
of
expansion
cause
a
shift
where
a
greater
portion
of
existing
traffic
is
anonymized
conceivably
the
services
could
play
a
role
in
influencing
future
mainstream
social
acceptance
of
usenet

what
is
a
hacker

these
terms
arouse
strong
feelings
by
many
on
their
meaning
especially
on
the
internet
in
the
general
news
media
in
the
past
a
person
who
uses
computers
and
networks
to
malicious
ends
such
as
breaking
into
systems
has
been
referred
to
as
a
hacker
but
most
internet
users
prefer
the
term
cracker
for
this
instead
a
hacker
is
perceived
as
a
benign
but
intensely
ambitious
curious
and
driven
computer
user
who
explores
obscure
areas
of
a
system

examplesomething
of
a

what
is
a
cypherpunk
from
the
charter
of
the
cypherpunk
mailing
list
cypherpunks
assume
privacy
is
a
good
thing
and
wish
there
were
more
of
it
cypherpunks
acknowledge
that
those
who
want
privacy
must
create
it
for
themselves
and
not
expect
governments
corporations
or
other
large
faceless
organizations
to
grant
them
privacy
out
of
beneficence
cypherpunks
know
that
people
have
been
creating
their
own
privacy
for
centuries
with
whispers
envelopes
closed
doors
and
couriers
cypherpunks
do
not
seek
to
prevent
other
people
from
speaking
about
their
experiences
or
their
opinions

is
steganography
or
the
techniques
for
not
only
pursuing
private
encrypted
communication
but
concealing
the
very
existence
of
the
communication
itself
many
new
possibilities
in
this
area
are
introduced
with
the
proliferation
of
computer
technology
for
example
it
is
possible
to
encode
messages
in
the
leastsignificant
bits
of
images
typically
the
most
noisy
in
addition
when
such
an
item
is
posted
in
a
public
place
such
as
a
newsgroup
virtually
untraceable
communication
can
take
place
between
sender
and
receiver
for
steganographic
communications
in
the
electronic
realm
one
another
possibility
is
setting
up
a
mailing
list
where
individual
messages
get
broadcast
to
the
entire
list
and
individual
users
decode
particular
messages

what
is
security
through
obscurity
security
through
obscurity
refers
to
the
attempt
to
gain
protection
from
system
weaknesses
by
hiding
sensitive
information
or
programs
relating
to
them
for
example
a
company
may
not
make
public
information
on
its
softwares
encryption
techniques
to
evade
attacks
based
on
knowledge
of
it
another
example
would
be
concealing
data
on
the
existence
of
security
holes
or
bugs
in
operating
systems
or
some
reliance
may
be
made
on
the
fact
that
some
standard
or
mechanism
with
potential
problems
is
serious
because
they
are
not
widely
known
or
not
widely
used
this
argument
is
occasionally
applied
to
mechanisms
for
email
and
usenet
posting
forgery
security
through
obscurity
is
regarded
as
a
very
feeble
technique
at
best
and
inappropriate
and
ineffective
at
worst

dec
digitized
information
is
very
hard
to
stamp
classified
or
keep
contained
this
stuff
is
incredibly
leaky
and
volatile
its
almost
a
life
form
in
its
ability
to
selfpropagate
if
something
hits
the
net
and
its
something
which
people
on
there
find
interesting
it
will
spread
like
a
virus
of
the
mind
i
believe
you
must
simply
accept
the
idea
that
we
are
moving
into
an
environment
where
any
information
which
is
at
all
interesting
to
people
is
going
to
get
out
and
there
will
be
very
little
that
you
can
do
about
it
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
my
view
but
you
may
differ

a

the
standard

not

perhaps
of

the

the

an

against

closed
thursday
with
a
clear
statement
by
federal
district
judge
sam
sparks
that
the
service
failed
to
conduct
a
proper
investigation
in
a
notorious
computer
crime
crackdown
and
went
too
far
in
retaining
custody

was

poor

abusive
computer

policies
while
the
service
has
seized
dozens
of
computers
since
the
crackdown
began
in
this
is
the
first
case
to
challenge
the
practice
sparks
grew
visibly
angry
when
it
was
established
that
the
austin
science
fiction
magazine
and
game
book
publisher
was
never
suspected
of
a
crime
and
that
agents
did
not
do
even
marginal
research
to
establish
a
criminal
connection
between
the
firm
and
the
suspected
illegal
activities
of
an
employee
or
to
determine
that
the
company
was
a
publisher
indeed
agents
testified
that
they
were
not
even
trained
in
the
privacy
protection
act
at
the
special
secret

how
long
would
it
have
taken
you
mr

to
find
out
what
steve

did
what
it
was
asked
sparks
an
hour
was
there
any
reason
why
on
march
you
could
not
return
to
steve

a
copy
in

form
of
everything
taken
did
you
read
the
article
in

it
had
a
picture
of
steve
jackson
a
lawabiding
taxpaying
citizen
saying
he
was
a
computer
crime
suspect
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
mr
foley
that
seizing
this
material
could
harm
steve
jackson
economically
foley
replied
no
sir
but
the
judge
offered
his
own
answer
you
actually
did
you
just
had
no
idea
anybody
would
actually
go
out
and
hire
a
lawyer

sue
you

in

that
worried

experts
software

telephone
companies
the
fbi
proposed
legislation
to
amend
the
communications
act
of
to
make
it
easier
for
the
bureau
to
perform
electronic
wiretapping
the
proposed
legislation
entitled
digital
telephony
would
have
required
communications
service
providers
and
hardware
manufacturers
to
make
their
systems
tappable
by
providing
back
doors
through
which
law
enforcement
officers
could
intercept
communications
furthermore
this
capability
would
have
been
provided
undetectably
while
the
communications
was
in
progress
exclusive
of
any
communications
between
other
parties
regardless
of
the
mobility
of
the
target
of
the

investigation
and
without
degradation
of

under
the
proposal
the
department
of

doj
can
keep
communications
products
off
the
market
if
it
determines
that
these
products
do
not
meet
the
dojs
own
guidelines
this
could
result
in
increased
costs
and
reduced
competitiveness
for

providers
and
equipment
manufacturers
since
they
will
be
unlikely
to
add
any
features
that
may
result
in
a
doj
rejection
of
their
entire
product
the
fbi
proposal
suggests
that
the
cost
of
this
wiretapping
service
to
the

would
have
to
be
borne

contains
general
and
nontechnical
introductory
notes
on
origins
of
the
internet
including
the
role
of
the

the

of
its
own
overwhelming
success
its
users
scarcely
noticed
for
arpanets
functions
not
only
continued
but
steadily
improved
the
use
of
tcpip
standards
for
computer
networking
is
now
global
in
a
mere
twentyone
years
ago
there
were
only
four
nodes
in
the
arpanet
network
today
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
nodes
in
the
internet
scattered
over
fortytwo
countries
with
more
coming
online
every
day
three
million
possibly
four
million
people

this
gigantic
motherofallcomputernetworks
the
internet
is
especially
popular
among
scientists
and
is
probably
the
most
important
scientific
instrument
of
the
late
twentieth
century
the
powerful
sophisticated
access
that
it
provides
to
specialized
data
and
personal
communication
has
sped
up
the
pace
of
scientific
research
enormously
the
internets
pace
of
growth
in
the
early
is
spectacular
almost
ferocious
it
is
spreading
faster
than
cellular
phones
faster
than
fax
machines
last
year
the
internet
was
growing
at
a
rate
of
twenty
percent
a
month
the
number
of
host
machines
with
direct
connection
to
tcpip
has
been
doubling
every
year
since
the
internet
is
moving
out
of
its
original
base
in
military
and
research
institutions
into
elementary
and
high

as
well
as
into

how
internet
anarchy
like
the
english
language
according
to
bruce
sterling
bruceswellsfcaus
the
internets
anarchy
may
seem
strange
or
even
unnatural
but
it
makes
a
certain
deep
and
basic
sense
its
rather
like
the
anarchy
of
the
english
language
nobody
rents
english
and
nobody
owns
english
as
an
englishspeaking
person
its
up
to
you
to
learn
how
to
speak
english
properly
and
make
whatever
use
you
please
of
it
though
the
government
provides
certain
subsidies
to
help
you
learn
to
read
and
write
a
bit
otherwise
everybody
just
sort
of
pitches
in
and
somehow
the
thing
evolves
on
its
own
and
somehow
turns
out
workable
and
interesting
fascinating
even
though
a
lot
of
people
earn
their
living
from
using
and
exploiting
and
teaching
english
english
as
an
institution
is
public
property
a
public
good
much
the
same
goes
for
the
internet
would
english
be
improved
if
the
the
english
language
inc
had
a
board
of
directors
and
a
chief
executive
officer
or
a
president
and
a
congress
thered
probably
be
a
lot
fewer
new
words
in
english
and
a

fewer

remember

avoid

the

hierarchy

give
as
much

remember
that
content
is
the
only
means
for
readers
to
judge
the
truth

that
any
inaccuracies
will
tend
to
discredit
the
entire

information
that
will

this
article
is
an
excerpt
from
an
issue
of
fidonews
on
individual
privacy
and
the
use
of
handles
it
accepts
the
need
of
a
system
operator
to
know
the
name
of
a
user
but
suggests
that
the
use
of
a
handle
is
analogous
to
a
request
to
withhold
the
name
in
a
letter
to
the
editor
the
article
concludes
with
a
set
of
guidelines
for
preserving
the
right
to
be
anonymous

try
putting
this
in

anonhj
anonymoushj
this
will
search
the
headers
of
the
messages
and
kill
any
that
contain
anon
or
anonymous
in
them
not
perfect
and
wont
kill
followups
note
that
anonymous
server
operators
have
the
capability
to
mask
anonymous
postings
under
which
the
above
method
will
not
work
so
far
this
practice
is
not
widespread
but
it
may
become
more
common
as
a
countermeasure
to
widespread
anonymous
filtering
what
is
the
history
behind
anonymous
posting
servers
originally
anonymous
posting
services
were
introduced
for
individual
particularly
volatile
newsgroups
where
anonymity
is
almost
the
preferred
method
of
communication
such
as
talkabortion
and
altsexbondage
one
of
the
first
was

but
was
disbanded
due
to
lack
of
funds
the
system
provided
anonymous
return
addresses
john
opalko
took
up
the
functions
of
this
server
including
reinstating
the
anonymous
alias
file
the
group
altpersonals
has
been
chewing
through
servers
like
theres
no
tomorrow
spurred
by
the
disappearance
of
wizvax
and
interested
in
researching
the
idea
karl
kleinpaste
karlkleinpastegodivanectarcscmuedu
developed
his
own
system
from
scratch
in
six
hours
by
this
time
the
idea
of
extending
the
server
to
new
more
mainstream
groups
was
starting
to
emerge
and
he
explored
the
possibility
partly
at
the
specific
request
by
multiple
users
for
anonymity
in
other
groups
the
intended
advantage
of
my
system
was
specifically
to
allow
multiple
group
support
with
a
single
anon
identifier
across
all
this
was
arguably
the
single
biggest
deficiency
of
previous
anon
systems
k
kleinpaste
posted
a
message
on
recnude
asking
users
whether
an
anonymous
service
would
be
welcome
there
and
judged
a
consensus
against
it
k
kleinpaste
introduced
what
he
calls
a
fire
extinguisher
to
squelch
or
plonk
abusive
users
in
response
to
complaints
and
used
this
in
three
cases
nevertheless
after
a
few
months
of
intense
traffic
he
was
eventually
overwhelmed
by
the
abuses
of
his
server
even
as
restricted
as
it
was
my
system
was
subjected
to
abuses
to
the
point
where
it
was
ordered
dismantled
by
the
facilities
staff
here
such
abuses
started
right
after
it
was
created
in
nov
johan
helsingius
julfpenetfi
set
up
the
most
controversial
anonymous
site
to
date
anonpenetfi
is
based
on
scripts
and
c
code
written
by
k
kleinpaste
and
supports
anonymized
mail
posting
and
return
addresses
he
initially
wanted
to
confine
the
service
to
scandinavian
users
but
expanded
it
to
worldwide
accessability
in
response
to
lots
of
international
requests
j
helsingius
policy
of
allowing
anonymous
posting
to
every
usenet
newsgroup
has
been
met
with
strong
and
serious
ideological
opposition
eg
by
news
adminstrators
in
newsadminpolicy
because
of
the
relative
newness
and
recent
emergence
of
the
medium
abuses
by
anonymous
posters
tend
to
have
higher
visibility
than
routine
abuses
his
total
commitment
to
preservation
of
anonymity
is
also
controversial
for
example
in
a
highly
controversial
and
publicized
case
in
feb
an
anonymous
user
posted
a
supposed
transcript
of
desperate
crew
dialogue
during
the
challenger
shuttle
disaster
via
anonpenetfi
to
sciastro
despite
that
the
transcript
had
been
posted
in
the
same
place
up
to
a
year
earlier
then
nonanonymously
and
actually
originated
not
with
the
poster
but
a
new
york
news
tabloid
subsequent
responses
consisted
largely
of
vociferous
outrage
at
the
posters
use
of
anonymity
reverberating
through
many
newsgroups
the
original
poster
using
the
same
anonymous
handle
later
conceded
that
the
story
seemed
likely
to
have
been
fabricated
suggesting
the
plausible
possibility
that
the
original
intent
was
not
to
provoke
outrage
but
gauge
reactions
on
the
authenticity
of
the
story
albeit
crudely
free
of
personal
risk
from
perceived
association
with
the
item
the
ensuing
commotion
generated
queries
for
the
original
article
by
lateentering
readers
the
anonymous
user
later
posted
deliberately
offensive
comments
at
his
detractors
despite
piercingly
irate
and
outraged
complaints
and
even
the
vocal
opposition
and
verbal
abuse
of
k
kleinpaste
and
eminent
news
operators
j
helsingius
has
largely
avoided
use
of
the
fire
extingisher
and
the
group
bouncer
mechanisms
that
limit
the
scope
of
the
service
as
of
march
the
anonpenetfi
site
is
best
described
as
inundated
it
has
registered
over
users
in
its
initial
three
months
of
operation
forwards
messages
a
day
and
approximately
of
all
usenet
postings
are
anonymized
through
the
site
the
immense
popularity
is
probably
largely
due
to
the
capability
for
global
anonymity
which
has
allowed
users
to
find
creative
uses
in
diverse
areas
not
previously
envisioned
johan
helsingius
has
been
subject
to
extraordinary
pressure
to
dismantle
his
server
in
feb
at
one
point
k
kleinpaste
threatened
publicly
to
organize
a
sort
of
vigilante
group
of
irate
news
operators
to
send
out
revocation
commands
on
all
messages
originating
from
the
site
j
helsingius
has
also
alluded
to
threats
of
flooding
the
server
the
server
has
crashed
several
times
at
least
once
due
to
a
saturation
mailbombing
through
it
by
an
anonymous
user
mr
helsingius
reports
spending
up
to
hours
per
day
answering
email
requests
alone
associated
with
the
services
administration
in
response
to
the
serious
threats
he
disabled
global
group
access
temporarily
for
one
week
and
encouraged
his
users
to
defend
the
service
publicly
based
on
fastmoving
dialogue
and
creative
suggestions
by
cypherpunks
j
helsingius
has
identified
many
security
weaknesses
and
valuable
new
features
for
the
service
and
is
currently
in
the
process
of
code
development
and
testing
he
is
planning
on
upgrading
the
ibm
compatible
machine
to
a
soon
to
handle
the
voluminous
load
and
is
considering
integrating
a
new
system
with
very
sophisticated
functionality
including
multiple
email
aliases
alias
allocation
control
publickey
encryption
etc
a
very
sophisticated
anonymous
posting
system
was
set
up
in
dec
by
d
clunie
dcluniepaxtpacomau
that
used
cryptography
in
both
directions
tofrom
the
server
for
the
highest
degree
of
confidentiality
seen
so
far
however
it
was
running
on
a
public
access
account
and
he
had
to
shut
it
down
after
only
several
weeks
upon
receiving
requests
and
conditions
apparently
ultimately
originating
from
nsf
representatives
d
clunie
has
released
the
software
to
the
public
domain
recently
the
idea
of
a
newsgroup
devoted
to
whistleblowing
on
government
abuses
has
received
wide
and
focused
attention
and
group
formation
is
currently
underway
in
the
basic
scenario
the
group
would
allow
people
to
post
pseudonymously
using
remailers
and
even
establish
reputations
based
on
their
authentifiable
digital
signatures
the
traffic
may
eventually
reach
reporters
in
the
mainstream
news
media
deltortoaolcom
has
volunteered
to
attack
multiple
aspects
of
this
project
including
distributing
easytoread
documentation
on
posting
anonymization
and
encryption

what
is
the
value
of
anonymity
kondaredpurccvmbitnet
i
think
anonymous
posts
do
help
in
focusing
our
attention
on
the
content
of
ones
message
sure
lot
of
anonymous
posts
are
abusive
or
frivolous
but
in
most
cases
these
are
by
users
who
find
the
anon
facility
novel
once
the
novelty
wears
off
they
are
stopping
their
pranks
morganengrukyedu
wes

i
dont
mind
seeing
the
miscellaneous
hatredprejudiceracism
those
things
are
part
of
our
nature
however
the
notion
of
providing
anonymitys
shield
for
these
ideas
repulses
me
if
they
have
such
strong
feelings
why
cant
they
put
their
names
on
their
postings
quite
frankly
i
loathe
communication
with
people
who
refuse
to
use
their
names
dcluniepaxtpacomau
david
clunie
many
seem
to
question
the
value
of
anonymity
but
who
are
they
to
say
what
risks
another
individual
should
take
there
is
no
question
that
in
this
rather
conservative
society
that
we
live
in
holding
certain
views
making
certain
statements
adopting
a
certain
lifestyle
are
likely
to
result
in
public
censure
ridicule
loss
of
status
employment
or
even
legal
action
given
the
heterogeneity
of
the
legal
jurisdictions
from
where
the
many
contributors
to
usenet
post
who
knows
what
is
legal
and
what
is
not
some
say
that
anonymous
posters
are
cowards
and
should
stand
up
and
be
counted
perhaps
that
is
one
point
of
view
but
what
right
do
these
detractors
have
to
exercise
such
censorship
from
dougccysuedu
doug
sewell
why
is
it
censorship
to
not
expect
someone
to
speak
for
themselves
without
the
cloak
of
anonymity
this
is
at
best
a
lame
argument
you
tell
me
why
what
you
have
to
say
requires
anonymity
and
you
tell
me
why
the
wishes
of
a
majority
of
nonanonymous
users
of
a
newsgroup
should
be
disregarded
when
they
dont
want
anonymous
posts
anonymous
users
have
less
rights
than
any
others
they
are
not
legitimate
usenet
participants
i
would
not
honor

or

from

i
can
think
of
no
disadvantage
caused
by
anon
posting
sites
that
doesnt
already
exist
other
than
the
fact
that
they
do
make
more
naive
net
users
who
dont
know
how
to
post
anonymously
the
old
way
more
prone
to
do
it
from
mandelnetcomcom
tom
mandel
i
cannot
speak
for
others
but
i
regard
anonymous
postings
in
a
serious
discussion
as
pretty
much
worthless
views
that
hide
behind
the
veil
of
anon
are
hardly
worth
the
trouble
of
reading
hank
pankey
since
i
began
posting
anonymously
to
show
support
for
general
principles
of
personal
privacy
i
have
been
subject
to
far
more
abuse
and
attack
than
i
ever
received
before
people
seem
to
find
it
easier
to
flame
and
insult
someone
whose
name
they
dont
know
perhaps
its
easier
to
pretend
that
there
is
no
person
behind
the
email
address
who
feels
the
sting
of
abusive
comments
anonymity
does
hinder
some
methods
of
controlling
other
posters
actions
people
who
seek
such
control
will
naturally
oppose
it
from
instead
of
making
this
a
freeer
medium
by
allowing
posters
to
protect
themselves
with
anonymity
simply
require
that
all
posters
be
prepared
to
discuss
their
sources
of
information
and
take
the
heat
for
unsubstantiated
dribble
this
seems
to
be
the
way
things
are
currently
done
xtkmgtrentuca
kate
gregory
in
misckids
there
are
three
threads
going
on
started
by
anonymous
posters
one
was
about
changing
jobs
so
as
to
work
less
hours
job
sharing
and
so
on
from
a
woman
who
didnt
want
anyone
at
her
current
place
of
work
to
know
she
was
thinking
of
looking
for
work
elsewhere
the
next
was
from
a
woman
who
is
thinking
of
having
a
baby
sometime
soon
and
doesnt
want
coworkers
friends
family
etc
etc
to
know
all
about
it
but
who
wants
advice
the
third
is
about
sex
after
parenthood
actually
this
was
started
by
people
posting
in
the
usual
way
but
then
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
anonymous
posting
service
might
let
more
people
participate
misckids
doesnt
seem
to
be
suffering
any
harm
from
the
presence
of
anonymous
posters
in
fact
it
seems
to
have
been
helped
by
it
hoeyzogwargetlarmymil
dan
hoey
while
there
has
never
been
any
real
security
against
anonymous
or
forged
postings
on
usenet
the
process
has
until
now
been
sufficiently
inconvenient
errorprone
and
undocumented
to
limit
its
use
by
persons
who
have
not
learned
the
culture
of
the
net
on
the
other
hand
a
recent
use
of
the
anonymous
posting
service
on
scimath
seemed
seemed
to
be
a
student
asking
help
on
a
homework
problem
it
has
now
been
attributed
to
a
teacher
asking
for
an
explanation
of
a
dubious
answer
in
his
teaching
guide
he
says
his
news
posting
is
broken
so
he
is
using
the
anonymous
service
as
a
mailtonews
gateway
karl
barrus
some
argue
that
the
opinions
of
the
people
who
hide
behind
a
veil
of
anonymity
are
worthless
and
that
people
should
own
up
to
their
thoughts
i
agree
with
the
latter
point
in
an
ideal
world
we
would
all
be
sitting
around
engaging
in
socratic
dialogues
freely
exchanging
our
opinions
in
an
effort
to
learn
but
in
an
ideal
world
nobody
will
threaten
you
for
your
thoughts
or
ridicule
you
but
we
live
in
a
world
where
the
people
who
dont
agree
with
you
may
try
to
harm
you
lets
face
it
some
people
arent
going
to
agree
with
your
opinion
no
matter
how
logically
you
try
to
present
it
or
how
reasoned
out
it
may
be
this
is
sad
since
it
does
restrict
people
from
voicing
their
opinions
redredpollneoucomedu
richard
e
depew
the
consensus
seems
to
be
that
a
general
anonymous
posting
service
such
as
that
at
anonpenetfi
seems
sufficiently
corrosive
of
the
trust
and
civility
of
the
net
that
this
particular
experiment
should
be
ended
perhaps
the
next
time
the
question
comes
up
we
can
say
we
tried
it
we
learned
it
does
more
harm
than
good
and
we
stopped
it

what
a

three

for

do
people
really
say
different

based
upon
whether
their

isnt

are
people
really
so
affected

what

is
labeled

most

on
a

that
prizes
itself
on
the

that

enjoys
is
there
really
such
a
thing

then
out

imho
worse
it
looks

gonna
get
stuck
with
these
things

as
much
as
i
dont
like
the
idea
of

like
this
becoming
the
norm
i
dont
really
think
theres
much
to
be
done

its
obvious
that
anyone

can
set

i
will
be
the
first
to
admit
that
i
hold
some
controversial
opinions
indeed
im
sure
that
none
of
us
are
completely
orthodox
in
our
opinions
however
ive
received
hundreds
of
anonymous
email
messages
over
the
last
few
years
fewer
than
of
them
were
reasonable
posts
made
with
good
motives
its
getting
more
and
more
difficult
to
remember
why
we
need
anonymity
at
all
the
abusers
are
once
again
lousing
things
up
for
those
who
truly
need
the
service
or
those
who
would
put
it
to
good
use
im
not
suggesting
that
we
should
ban
anonymous
servers
as
ive
said
there
are
several
situations
in
which
anonymity
is
a
good
thing
tm
however
the
notion
that
anonymitys
shield
should
be
automatically
extended
to
every
usenet
discussion
is
ridiculous
it
opens
the
door
to
further
abuse
twpierceunixamherstedu
tim
pierce
of
course
how
does
one
determine
whether
a
group
requests
the
service
a
flat
majority
of
posters
voting
in
favor
a
positive
margin
of
votes
or
what
no
one
speaks
for
a
newsgroup
im
not
convinced
by
the
arguments
that
an
anonymous
posting
service
for
all
newsgroups
is
inherently
a
bad
idea
simply
because
its
a
diversion
from
the
status
quo
since
the
status
quo
previously
permitted
anonymous
posting
to
no
newsgroups
any
anonymous
posting
service
would
reject
the
status
quo
hartmanulogicuucp
richard

writes
it
is
facist
to
suggest
that
a
newsgroup
is
best

whether

of
having
them

the

provides
a
mechanism
for

since
most
usenet
readers
dont
know
john

from

except
by
their
opinions
and
their

the
effect
of
having
an

which

replies
can
be
directed
is
minimal
except
for
those
who
personally
know
the

the
lack
of
anonymity
could
be
serious
any
mechanism
like
this
is
liable
to
abuse
but
the
benefits
as
well
as
the
costs
must
be
weighed
limiting
the
service
to
alt
groups

not

sensitive

an
additional
point
is
that
some
of

find

i
back
away
carefully

in

technical
discussion
anonimity
means
that
the
individual
isnt
willing
to
associate
himself
with
the
matter
being
discussed
which
discredits
his
utterances
and
makes
listening
to
them
a
waste
of
time
anonimity
leads
to
fun
psych
experiments
the
literature
is
filled
with
all
the
various
things
that
people
will
do
anonymously
that
they
wont
otherwise
including
one
notorious
study
involving
torture
that
would
not

you
obviously
have
never
submitted
an
article
to
a
refereed
journal
where
you
will
receive
anonymous
reviews
through
a
server
the
editor
that
behaves
much
like
the
one
in
finland
eg
you
may
reply
and
the
editor
will
maintain
the
anonymity
your

of

on

anonymously
with

who
approaches
you
on

it
seems
obvious
to
me
that
the
default
should
be
not
to
allow
anonymous
postings
in
a
newsgroup
the
usenet
has
always
operated
on
the
principle
that
the
status
quo
should
be
kept
unless
theres
a
large
number
of
people
who
want
to
change
it
if
someone
really
needs
to
post
a
message
anonymous
in
a
newsgroup
in
which
this
usually
isnt
done
they
can
usually
find
someone
on
the
net
to
do
this
for
them
they
dont
need
an
automated
service
to
do
it
and
the
automated
service
is
by
its
nature
incapable
of
making
the
judgment
call
necessary
to
decide
whether
a
particular
posting
really
needs
to
be
anonymous
from
twpierceunixamherstedu
tim
pierce
for
any
newsgroup
you
name
i
bet
i
can
envision
a
scenario
involving
a
need
for
secrecy
if
an
accurate
contentbased
filter
of
each
anonymous
posting
could
be
devised
to
screen
out
those
that
dont
require
secrecy
wonderful
but
it
cant
be
done

if
a
newsgroup
wants
to
be
noise
and
nuisancefree
then
it
should
call
for
moderation
this
should
happen
on
a
pernewsgroup
basis
and
not
as
a
general
usenet
ban
on
anonymous
postings
of
course
one
principle
of
moderation
might
be
to
keep
out
all
anonymous
postings
and
could
be
achieved
automatically
it
would
still
be
moderation
personally
i
would
prefer
moderation
criteria
being
based
on
actual
content
david
a
clunie
dcluniepaxtpacomau
if
a
group
doesnt
want
to
receive
certain
posts
it
should
become
moderated
there
are
clearly
defined
mechanisms
on
nonalt
groups
for
this
to
take
place
an
automated
moderator
excluding
posts
from
certain
eg
anonymous
sites
or
individuals
could
easily
be
established
if
anyone
wants
to
take
such
a
draconian
approach
then
they
are
welcome
to
do
so
and
good
luck

them

what
possible

would
someone
have
for
posting
anonymously
to
a

sure
most
adults
are
willing
to
post
under
their
own

why
would
they
want
to
hide
behind
an
anonymous

service
ashamed
of
what
they
have
to
say
or
just
trying
to
rile
people
without
fear
of
being

anonymous
posting
have
their
place
in
certain
groups
if
i
or
anyone
else
needs
to
tell
you
what
those
groups
are
then
youve
been
on
another

breathing
exotic
gases
for
too
long
from
karlkleinpastecscmuedu
its
bloody
fascinating
that
all
the
proponents
of
unimpeded
universal
anon
posting
access
cant
seem
to
find
any
middle
ground
at
all
why
is
there
such
a
perception
of
absolutism
where
does
this
instant

syndrome
come
from
i
want
anon
access
and
i
want
it
now
who
are
the
control
freaks
here
from
remember
this
is
a
newsgroup
for
posters
writing
about
scientific

anonymous
discussion
of
scientific

leads

arguments

to

me
that
omninewsgroup
anonymous
posting
should
be
banned
or
severely
restricted
though
i
cannot
prove
it
it
seems
to
me
that
those
who
do
not
like
anonymous
posting
in
principle
do
so
for
reasons
that
are
personal
read
psychological
discomfort
rather
than
for
reasons
related
to
maintaining
the
integrity
of
usenet
remember
it
is
impossible
to
be
able
to
ascertain
all
the
conceivable
and
legitimate
motives
for
anonymous
posting
to
newsgroups
one
normally
would
not
deem
to
be
sensitive
in
general
i
fear
even
letting
newsgroup
readers
vote
on
either
allowing
or
not
allowing
anonymous
posting
since
a
priori
they
cannot
know
all
the
motives
of
legitimate
posters
and
i
do
not
believe
that
any
system
should
ever
be
instituted
that
would
inhibit
the
posting
of
legitimate

informative

i
think
that
what
these
points
show
clearly
is
that
an
anonymous
posting
service
has
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
both
towards
its
clients
and
towards
the
net
as
a
whole
such
a
service
should
imho
have
a
set
of
welldefined
rules
and
a
contract
that
its
clients
should
sign
under
the
terms
of
which
they
are
assured
anonymity
from
is
the
problem
that
some
are
used
to
punishing
posters
who
are
upsetting
in
some
vague
way
by
complaining
to
the
usually
acquiescent
sysadmin
or
organizations
that
the
poster
belongs
to
that
surely
is
the
most
gutless
approach
to
solving
problems
but
my
experience
on
the
net
shows
that
the
same
users
who
vilify
anonymous
postings
are
the
first
to
write
obsessively
detailed
grievances
to
the
posters
supervisor
when
his
or
her
tranquility
is
disturbed
by
some
intrusive
or
subversive
post
or
another
anonymous
postings
prevent
just
this
kind
of
intimidation

the
main
point
i
would

to
make
here
is
that
while
we
can
go
through

revise
the

sw
to
reject
anon
posts
to
technical
newsgroups
or
some
such
thing
i
think
the
attempt
will
prove
futile
each
attempt
to
modify
news
can
result
in
a
changed
approach
by
anon
service
providers
to
thwart
the
change

be
pointless

i
have

out
of
this

where
the

now
i
rally
feel
like
i
have
to
speak
up
i
have
repeatedly
made
clear
that
i
do
block
users
if
they
continue
their
abuse
after
having
been
warned
in
many
cases
the
users
have
taken
heed
of
the
warning
and
stopped
and
in
some
cases
even
apologized
in
public
and
when
the
warning
has
not
had
the
desired
effect
i
have
blocked
a
number
of
users
i
have
also
blocked
access
to
groups
where
the
readership
has
taken
a
vote
to
ban
anonymous
postings
although
i
feel
changing
the
newsgroup
status
to
moderated
is
the
only
permanent
solution
for
newsgroups
that
want
to
formalize
discussion

does
this
mean

request
for

to
moderate
each
of
the
newsgroups
that
your
server
can
reach
i
dont
think
so
but
this
illustrates
the
trouble
that
your
server
is
causing
please
listen
to
the
consensus
of
the
news
administrators
in
this
group
any
newsgroup
should
be
consulted
before
letting
your
server
post
messages
to
that
group
from
alexander
eichener
there
is
no
pompous
consensus
of
the
news
administrators
here
maybe
you
would
like
to
invent
one
there
is
a
sizeable
number
of
people
who
are
concerned
about
the
possible
and
to
a
minor
extent
about
the
actual
abuse
of
the
server
as
it
is
configured
now
these
concerns
are
respectable
johan
is
dealing
with
them
there
are
some
few
who
rage
with
foam
before
their
mouth
and
condemn
the
service
altogether
and
a
number
who
defend
it
pointing
out
like
kate
gregory
that
even
a
group
like
misckids
can
benefit
from
pseudonymous
postings
from

i
have
answered
a
lot
of
personal
mail
related
to
server
abuse
and
as
a
result
of
that
blocked
a
number
of
abusive
users
i
have
also
withdrawn
the
service
from
several
newsgroups
where
the
users
have
taken
a
vote
on
the
issue
i
have
not
made
any
comments
on
newsadminpolicy
partly
because
the
newlyimplemented
password
feature
as
a
emergency
measure
against
a
security
hole
has
kept
me
really
busy
answering
user
queries
the
last
two
weeks
and
partly
because
i
feel
it
is
not
for
me
to
justify
the
service
but
for
the
users
the
problem
with
newsadminpolicy
is
that
the
readership
is
rather
elective
representing
people

a
strong
interest
in

would
consider
that

wishes
to
discuss
how
the

should
be
controlled
saying
that
we

clear
indication
of
bias

are
perfectly

join

here
to
promote
your
views
on
control
jbuckohmberkeleyedu
this
whole
debate
is
a
lot
of
sound
and
fury
signifying
nothing
because
even
if
you
all
decide
to
ban
anonymous
posting
servers
it
is
not
enforceable
the
only
people
who
conceivably
could
enforce
retrictions
are
those
that
control
the
international
links
policy
changes
should
be
made
by
cooperation
not
by
attempting
to
dictate
you
need
to
persuade
those
who
run
the
services
to
act
like
this
through
friendly
persuasion

by

beat
them

boring

point
the

would
like
to
keep
their
network
the
way
it
always

been

this
new
thing
these
pseudonymous

cuts
into
their
turf
so
they
whine

bitch
about
it

every
time
theres
the
slightest
abuse
such
as
somebodys
sig
being
too
long
they
try
to
parlay
that
into
an
argument
against
pseudonymity
ill
go
on
record
as
saying
three
cheers
for
the
admins
at
anon
servers
like
penet
pax
and
and
for
all
the
access
service
providers
who
are
willing
to
preserve
their

privacy

a
pox
on
those
who
try
to
defeat

restrict

you
will
cause

inconvenience

annoyance

unfortunately
one
of

involved

complained
to
the
australian
academic
reasearch
network
through

my

not
about
anything
in

just
the
concept
of

having
no

consuming

narrow
bandwidth

with
which
i
cant
argue

that
was
that
stop
the

face
disconnection
i
consider
the
demise
of
my

to
have
been
rather
unfortunate

i
wish
the

luck
it
is
a
pity
that
there
are
very
few
if
any
similar
services
provided
with
in
the
us
i
guess
thats
the
benefit
of
having
a
constitution
that
guarantees
one
freedom
of
speech
and
a
legal
and
political
system
that
conspires
to
subvert
it
in
the
name
of
the

anonpenetfi
and
universal
anon
access
but
somehow
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
same
equation
not
even
arguing
to
shut
it
off
entirely
but
rather
just
to
have
some
control
applied
to
the
abuses
that
manifest
themselves
arent
allowed
to
do
that
i
have
written
to
johan
several
times
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
he
used
to
reply
to
me
quite
readily
after
all
i
was
the
source
of
the
software
as
originally
delivered
to
him
he
used
to
be
downright
prompt
about
replying
to
me
funny
now
hes
being
an
impolite
bastard
who
doesnt
answer
mail
atall
even
when
it
consists
of
really
very
civil
queries
from
julfpenetfi
johan
helsingius
in
your
mail
you
told
me
you
sent
me
one
or
more
messages
on
feb
feb
and
the
server
was
down
and
the
flood
of
mail
that
resulted
from
the
server
coming
up
again
crashed
my
own
mail
host
the
problem
was
aggregated
by
an
abusive
user
sending
thousands
of
messages
to
another
user
filling
up
that
users
mailbox
the
bounce
messages
ended
up
in
my
mailbox
overflowing
my
local
disk
as
well
i
can
only
suppose
that
your
message
got
lost
in
that
hassle
as
i
have
tried
to
answer
as
much
as
possible
of
the
anonrelated
messages
i
get
from
routine
misaddessed
messages
to
complaints
about
the
service
on
the
average
i
spend
hours
per
day
answering
anonrelated
messages
from
karlkleinpastecscmuedu
why
is
it
that
everybody
else
has
to
put
up
with
the
impoliteness
and
insensitivity
of
the
misuse
of
anonpenetfi
whose
definitions
of
polite
and
sense
apply
and
why
why
is
universal
anon
access
considered
to
be
within
the
realm
of
this
fuzzy
concept
of
politeness
in
the
first
place
i
think
johan
has
long
since
crossed
the
line
into
being
a
rude
bastard
and
i
told
him
so
in
private
mail
a
little
while
ago
at
this
point
i
deeply
regret
a
having
created
an
anonymous
system
supporting
newsgroup
and
b
having
given
the
code
to
johan
i
didnt
copyright
it
but
i
thought
that
some
concept
of
politeness
and
good
sense
might
follow
it
to
new
homes
interesting
that
johans
ideas
of
politeness
and
good
sense
seem
to
have
nearly
no
interesection
with
mine
i
could
even
cope
with
universal
anon
access
if
johan
would
be
willing
to
engage
in
abuse
control
but
somehow
that
seems
to
be
outside
the
range
of
reality
from
julfpenetfi
johan
helsingius
there
is
no
way
for
me
to
convey
how
sad
and
upset
your
message
made
me
i
do
to
some
extent
understand
your
feelings
but
it
still
feels
really
bad
running
the
server
requires
getting
used
to
a
lot
of
flames
but
mindlessly
abusive
hate
mail
is
so
much
easier
to
deal
with
than
something
like
this
as
i
do
respect
and
value
your
views
and
opinions
to
a
high
degree
no
im
not
asking
for
sympathy
i
just
wanted
you
to
know
that
i
am
really
giving
your
views
quite
a
lot
of
weight
when
i
asked
for
the
software
i
was
actually
only
going
to
provide
the
service
to
scandinavian
users
but
a
lot
of
people
requested
that
i
keep
the
service
open
to
the
international
community
i
now
realize
that
i
ought
to
have
contacted
you
at
that
point
to
ask
how
you
feel
about
me
using
your
stuff
in
such
a
context
again
i
really
want
to
apologise
and
i
will
replace
the
remaining
few
pieces
of
code
thet
still
stem
from
your
system
unfortunately
there
is
no
way
to
remove
the
ideas
and
structure
i
got
from
you
again
i
am
really
sorry
that
the
results
of
your
work
ended
up
being
used
in
a
way
that
you
dont
approve
of
and
i
will
be
giving
a
lot
of
hard
thought
to
the
possibility
of
shutting
down
the
server
alltogether
from
karlkleinpastecscmuedu
i
think
im
feeling
especially
rude
and
impolite
if
its
good
for
johan
its
good
for
me
after
all
he
didnt
ask
the
greater
usenet
whether
universal
anon
access
was
a
good
idea
he
just
did
it
yes
im
a
seriously
rude
pain
in
the
ass
now
and
i
think
ill
arm
the
usenet
death
penalty
slightly
modified
not
for
strategic
wholesite
attack
but
tactical
assault
just
destruction
only
outside
alt
too
lets
say
to
parrot
this
linepeople
have
been
doing
things
like
the
udp
that
is
cancelling
others
postings
for
years
no
one
could
ever
stop
them
and
its
only
politeness
and
good
sense
that
has
prevented
them
up
to
now
in
fact
i
have
people
who
have
expressed
privately
the
desire
and
ability
to
arm
the
udp
ps
no
in
fact
there
are
not
newsadmins
ready
to
arm
the
udp
it
would
be
amusing
to
know
how
many
people
gulped
hard
when
they
read
that
though
i
dont
see
it
as
any
different
from
johans
configuration
pps
now
that
ive
calmed
some
fears
by
the
above
ps
there
are
newsadmins
ready
to
arm
the
udp
theyve
asked
for
my
code
i
havent
sent
it
yet
only
one
site
would
be
necessary
to
bring
anonpenetfi
to
a
screeching
halt
anyone
can
implement
the
udp
on
their
own
if
they
care
to
politeness
and
good
sense
prevents
them
from
doing
so
i
wonder
how
long
before
one
form
of
impoliteness
brings
on
another
form
from
julfpenetfi
johan
helsingius
it
would
be
trivially
easy
to
bring
anonpenetfi
to
a
screeching
halt
in
fact
it
has
happened
a
couple
of
times
already
but
as
we
are
talking
threats
here
let
me
make
one
as
well
a
very
simple
one
if
somebody
uses
something
like
the
udp
or
maliciously
brings
down
anonpenetfi
by
some
other
means
it
will
stay
down
but
i
will
let
the
users
know
why
and
name
the
person
who
did
it
ok
as
somebody
said
on
this
thread
you
have
to
take
personal
responsibility
for
your
actions
right
from
atul

i
am
very
grateful
and
appreciative
of
this
service
courtesey
of
penetfi
some
important
questions
about
my
personal
lifecareerjob
were
resolved
due
to
kind
help
of
other
people
who
had
been
thru
similar
situations
in
return
i
have
also
replied
to
anon
postings
where
i
thought
i
could
make
a
positive
contribution
in
general
anon
service
is
a
great
in
my
opinion
although
like
any
tool
some
people
will
not
use
it
responsibly
i
suggest
that
it
should
be
kept
alive
wasting
bandwidth
is
less
important
than
saving
lives
i
think
from
elisa
j
collins
i
have
been
informed
that
the
anonymous
posting
service
to
many
newsgroups
has
been
turned
off
as
a
result
of
discussions
in
this
newsgroup
over
people
abusing
it
i
had
been
posting
to
a
nontechnical
misc
newsgroup
about
an
intimate
topic
for
which
i
felt
i
required
privacy
i
have
received
immeasurable
help
from
the
people
in
that
newsgroup
and
i
have
never
used
anonymity
to
behave
in
an
abusive
immature
or
unethical
fashion
toward
anyone
please
folks
believe
me
i
need
this
service
please
consider
my
point
of
view
and
permit
adminanonpenetfi

networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as
policy
options
are
developed
the
administration
is
committed
to
working
with
the
private
sector
to
spur
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
which
will
use
new
telecommunications
and
computer
technologies
to
give
americans
unprecedented
access
to
information
this
infrastructure
of
highspeed
networks
information
superhighways
will
transmit
video
images
hdtv
programming
and
huge
data
files
as
easily
as
todays
telephone
system
transmits
voice
since
encryption
technology
will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop
consistent
comprehensive
policies
regarding
its
use
the
administration
is
committed
to
policies
that
protect
all
americans
right
to
privacy
while
also
protecting
them
from
those
who
break

initiative
q
does
this

expand
the

of

a
no

technology
provides
law

with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
q
who
will
run
the
keyescrow
data
banks
a
the
two
keyescrow
data
banks
will
be
run
by
two
independent
entities
at
this
point
the
department
of
justice
and
the
administration
have
yet
to
determine
which
agencies
will
oversee
the
keyescrow
data
banks
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
q
whose
decision
was
it
to
propose
this
product
a
the
national
security
council
the
justice
department
the
commerce
department
and
other
key
agencies
were
involved
in
this
decision
this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the
chip
manufacturer
that
produces
them
q
who
provides
the
clipper
chip
a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their
facility
in
torrance
california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of
these

i
do
not
agree
at
all
with
what
went
on
in
this
case
and
neither
will
most
of
you
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
it
did
happen
right
here
in
america
even
about
three
or
four
years
ago
there
was
a
rather
nasty
custody
case
in
or
around
washington
dc
the
upshot
was
an
exhusband
was
suing
for
visitation
rights
which
were
granted
the
woman
believed
that
the
man
had
been
sexually
molesting
her
children
much
like
allenfarrow
but
not
as
famous
anyhows
she
spirits
away
the
kids
and
refuses
to
tell
the
court
where
they
are
and
denies
him
visitation
rights
she
keeps
her
mouth
shut
and
what
happens
she
sits
in
jail
for
almost
a
year
on
contempt
of
court
until
the
legislature
passes
a
special
law
limiting
the
time
a
person
can
be
held
if
they
hadnt
passed
the
law
shed
most
likely
still
be
there
the
kids
were
in
new
zealand
i
belive
now
story
finished
commetary
starting
imho
the
only
reason
the
legislature
moved
was
because
there
was
an
outpouring
of
public
sympathy
for
this
woman
most
people
believed
she
was
right
and
were
outraged
not
likely
to
happen
for
joe
random
drug
dealer
child
molester
or
perfectly
innocent
privacy
lover
who
might
have
something
to
hide
innocent
until
proven
guilty
doesnt
mean
you
get
to
walk
out
of
court
humming
a
happy
tune
because
the
fbi
cant
read
your
disk
just
ask
those
held
for
contempt
those
who
cant
make
bail
etc
etc
again
i
disagree
totally
with
the
concept
of
holding
someone
based
on
suspicion
but
people
who
keep
thinking
that
it
wont
happen
are
bound
to
get
a
rude
shock
when
it
does
also
not
a
lawyer
etc
but
if
i
remember
correctly
the
contempt
of
court
business
is
used
in
order
to
compel
cooperation
with
what
is
perhaps
questionably
different
issue
the
legitimate
business
of
that
court
quite
literally
the
party
is
found
guilty
of
holding
the
court
in
contempt
now
the
original
scheme
as
suggested
here
would
be
to
have
the
key
disappear
if
certain
threatening
conditions
are
met
once
the
key
is
gone
there
is
no
question
of
contempt
of
court
as
there
is
nothing
to
compell
the
key
is
no
longer
there
to
be
produced
obstruction
of
justice
would
be
a
different
issue
but
if
the
suspect
in
question
would
have
some
legitmate
reason
to
protect
his
data
from
prying
eyes
however
extenuated
i
think
that
this
charge
would
be
a
hard
nut
to
make
perhaps
it
is

and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as
policy
options
are
developed
the
administration
is
committed
to
working
with
the
private
sector
to
spur
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
which
will
use
new
telecommunications
and
computer
technologies
to
give
americans
unprecedented
access
to

this
infrastructure
of

information
superhighways
will
transmit
video

and
huge

as
easily
as
todays

since
encryption
technology
will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop
consistent

to
policies
that
protect

a
no

technology
provides
law

with
no
new

to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
q
who
will
run
the
keyescrow
data
banks
a
the
two
keyescrow
data
banks
will
be
run
by
two
independent
entities
at
this
point
the
department
of
justice
and
the
administration
have
yet
to
determine
which
agencies
will
oversee
the
keyescrow
data
banks
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
q
whose
decision
was
it
to
propose
this
product
a
the
national
security
council
the
justice
department
the
commerce
department
and
other
key
agencies
were
involved
in
this
decision
this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the
chip
manufacturer
that
produces
them
q
who
provides
the
clipper
chip
a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their
facility
in
torrance
california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of
these
products

the

today
announced
a
new

together
with

in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
a
nice
formulation
for
the
introduction
of
the
first
encryption
devices
with
builtin
trapdoors
just
like
the
feds
wanted
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
blabla
protect
electronic

and
computer

while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal

it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug

and
other

indeed
and
the
current
proposal
does
nothing
to
prevent
the
latter
an
ordinary

it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
doesnt
say
much
there
are
many
incredibly
weak
encryption
algorithms
in
commercial

today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary

protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
except
from

at

this

preserves
the

nope
the

wont
be

enough
to
use

theyll
use

this

has
the

it
doesnt

much
if
they

the

provides

correct
it
does
however
provide

in

if
the

is
not
public
it
cannot
be
trusted
some
people
do
not
trust
des
even
today
after
all
the
examinations
only
because
some
parts
of
its
design
were
kept
secret
the

is
an
important

dualedge

encryption
helps
to
protect
the

but
it

we
need
the

and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding

with

to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their

in

so
theyll
use
a
different

so
will
those
lawabiding

who
do
not
trust
their

not
to
misuse
its

the

including
the

the
need

why

bullshit
the

encryption
devices
with

not

the
key
question
is
whether
nonclipper

will
be
made
illegal
the

is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public

there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this

is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in

are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
the
clear
middle
ground
implied
by
these
statements
is
to
say
that
americans
have
the
right
to
clipper
encryption
but
not
to
unbreakable
encryption
this
implies
that
ultimately
nonclipper
strong

must
become
illegal
as
an
aside
isnt

today
announced
a
new
initiative
that

together
with

in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone

while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law

the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law

previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against

the
rights
of

can
help

it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem

encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of

we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to

they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow

the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ

purposes
the
ability
of
authorized

threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their

reinventing
crypto
policy
an
eff
statement
april
initial
eff
analysis
of
clinton
privacy
and
security
proposal
the
clinton
administration
today
made
a
major
announcement
on
cryptography
policy
which
will
effect
the
privacy
and
security
of
millions
of
americans
the
first
part
of
the
plan
is
to
begin
a
comprehensive
inquiry
into
major
communications
privacy
issues
such
as
export
controls
which
have
effectively
denied
most
people
easy
access
to
robust
encryption
and
law
enforcement
issues
posed
by
new
technology
however
eff
is
very
concerned
that
the
administration
has
already
reached
a
conclusion
on
one
critical
part
of
the
inquiry
before
any
public
comment
or
discussion
has
been
allowed
apparently
the
administration
is
going
to
use
its
leverage
to
get
all
telephone
equipment
vendors
to
adopt
a
voice
encryption
standard
developed
by
the
national
security
agency
the
socalled
clipper
chip
is
an
split
key
escrowed
encryption
scheme
which
will
be
built
into
chips
manufactured
by
a
military
contractor
two
separate
escrow
agents
would
store
users
keys
and
be
required
to
turn
them
over
law
enforcement
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
warrant
the
encryption
scheme
used
is
to
be
classified
but
the
chips
will
be
available
to
any
manufacturer
for
incorporation
into
its
communications
products
this
proposal
raises
a
number
of
serious
concerns
first
the
administration
has
adopted
a
solution
before
conducting
an
inquiry
the
nsadeveloped
clipper
chip
may
not
be
the
most
secure
product
other
vendors
or
developers
may
have
better
schemes
furthermore
we
should
not
rely
on
the
government
as
the
sole
source
for
the
clipper
or
any
other
chips
rather
independent
chip
manufacturers
should
be
able
to
produce
chipsets
based
on
open
standards
second
an
algorithm
cannot
be
trusted
unless
it
can
be
tested
yet
the
administration
proposes
to
keep
the
chip
algorithm
classified
eff
believes
that
any
standard
adopted
ought
to
be
public
and
open
the
public
will
only
have
confidence
in
the
security
of
a
standard
that
is
open
to
independent
expert
scrutiny
third
while
the
use
of
the
use
of
a
splitkey
dual
escrowed
system
may
prove
to
be
a
reasonable
balance
between
privacy
and
law
enforcement
needs
the
details
of
this
scheme
must
be
explored
publicly
before
it
is
adopted
what
will
give
people
confidence
in
the
safety
of
their
keys
does
disclosure
of
keys
to
a
third
party
waive
an
individuals
fifth
amendment
rights
in
subsequent
criminal
inquiries
these
are
but
a
few
of
the
many
questions
the
administrations
proposal
raised
but
fails
to
answer
in
sum
the
administration
has
shown
great
sensitivity
to
the
importance
of
these
issues
by
planning
a
comprehensive
inquiry
into
digital
privacy
and
security
however
the
clipper
chip
solution
ought
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
inquiry
and
not
be
adopted
before
the
discussion
even
begins
details
of
the
proposal
escrow
the
key
will
be
divided
between
two
escrow
agents
each
of
whom
hold
of
each
key
the
manufacturer
of
the
communications
device
would
be
required
to
register
all
keys
with
the
two
independent
escrow
agents
a
key
is
tied
to
the
device
however
not
the
person
using
it
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
court
order
the
two
escrow
agents
would
have
to
turn
the
key
parts
over
to
law
enforcement
agents
according
to
the
presidential
directive
just
issued
the
attorney
general
will
be
asked
to
identify
appropriate
escrow
agents
some
in
the
administration
have
suggested
that
one
nonlaw
enforcement
federal
agency
perhaps
the
federal
reserve
and
one
nongovernmental
organization
could
be
chosen
but
there
is
no
agreement
on
the
identity
of
the

and
the
possibility
of

the
administration
claims
that
there
are
no

by
which
the
government
or
others
could
break
the
code
without
securing
keys
from
the
escrow
agents
and
that
the
president
will
be
told
there
are
no
back

to
this
classified
algorithm
in

to
prove
this

for
an

team
to
come

substantially
more
robust
than

standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the

needed
to

the
system
for
the
escrowing
of

of
clinton
privacy
and
security
proposal
the
clinton
administration
today
made
a
major
announcement
on
cryptography
policy
which
will
effect
the
privacy
and
security
of
millions
of
americans
the
first
part
of
the
plan
is
to
begin
a
comprehensive
inquiry
into
major
communications
privacy
issues
such
as
export
controls
which
have
effectively
denied
most
people
easy
access
to
robust
encryption
as
well
as
law
enforcement
issues
posed
by
new
technology
however
eff
is
very
concerned
that
the
administration
has
already
reached
a
conclusion
on
one
critical
part
of
the
inquiry
before
any
public
comment
or
discussion
has
been
allowed
apparently
the
administration
is
going
to
use
its
leverage
to
get
all
telephone
equipment
vendors
to
adopt
a
voice
encryption
standard
developed
by
the
national
security
agency
the
socalled
clipper
chip
is
an
split
key
escrowed
encryption
scheme
which
will
be
built
into
chips
manufactured
by
a
military
contractor
two
separate
escrow
agents
would
store
users
keys
and
be
required
to
turn
them
over
law
enforcement
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
warrant
the
encryption
scheme
used
is
to
be
classified
but
they
chips
will
be
available
to
any
manufacturer
for
incorporation
into
their
communications
products
this
proposal
raises
a
number
of
serious
concerns
first
the
administration
appears
to
be
adopting
a
solution
before
conducting
an
inquiry
the
nsadeveloped
clipper
chip
may
not
be
the
most
secure
product
other
vendors
or
developers
may
have
better
schemes
furthermore
we
should
not
rely
on
the
government
as
the
sole
source
for
clipper
or
any
other
chips
rather
independent
chip
manufacturers
should
be
able
to
produce
chipsets
based
on
open
standards
second
an
algorithm
can
not
be
trusted
unless
it
can
be
tested
yet
the
administration
proposes
to
keep
the
chip
algorithm
classified
eff
believes
that
any
standard
adopted
ought
to
be
public
and
open
the
public
will
only
have
confidence
in
the
security
of
a
standard
that
is
open
to
independent
expert
scrutiny
third
while
the
use
of
the
splitkey
dualescrowed
system
may
prove
to
be
a
reasonable
balance
between
privacy
and
law
enforcement
needs
the
details
of
this
scheme
must
be
explored
publicly
before
it
is
adopted
what
will
give
people
confidence
in
the
safety
of
their
keys
does
disclosure
of
keys
to
a
third
party
waive
individuals
fifth
amendment
rights
in
subsequent
criminal
inquiries
in
sum
the
administration
has
shown
great
sensitivity
to
the
importance
of
these
issues
by
planning
a
comprehensive
inquiry
into
digital
privacy
and
security
however
the
clipper
chip
solution
ought
to
be
considered
as
part
of
the
inquiry
not
be
adopted
before
the
discussion
even
begins
details
of
the
proposal
escrow
the
key
will
be
divided
between
two
escrow
agents
each
of
whom
hold
bits
of
each
key
upon
presentation
of
a
valid
warrant
the
two
escrow
agents
would
have
to
turn
the
key
parts
over
to
law
enforcement
agents
most
likely
the
attorney
general
will
be
asked
to
identify
appropriate
escrow
agents
some
in
the
administration
have
suggested
one
nonlaw
enforcement
federal
agency
perhaps
the
federal
reserve
and
one
nongovernmental
organization
but
there
is
no
agreement
on
the
identity
of
the
agents
yet
key
registration
would
be
done
by
the
manufacturer
of
the
communications
device
a
key
is
tied
to
the
device
not
to
the
person
using
it
classified
algorithm
and
the
possibility
of
back
doors
the
administration
claims
that
there
are
no
back
door
means
by
which
the
government
or
others
could
break
the
code
without
securing
keys
from
the
escrow
agents
and
that
the
president
will
be
told
there
are
no
back
doors
to
this
classified
algorithm
in
order
to
prove
this
administration
sources
are
interested
in
arranging
for
an
allstar
crypto
cracker
team
to
come
in
under
a
security
arrangement
and
examine
the
algorithm
for
trap
doors
the
results
of
the
investigation
would
then
be
made
public
government
as
market
driver
in
order
to
get
a
market
moving
and
to
show
that
the
government
believes
in
the
security
of
this
system
the
feds
will
be
the
first
big
customers
for
this
product
users
will
include
the

re
secret
algorithm
re
clipper
chip
and
crypto
keyescrow
though
some
may
argue
about
the
nose
of
the
camel
its
worth
noting
that
the
government
proposal
is
limited
to
scrambled
telephony
if
it
is
only
used
for
that
purpose
and
does
not
extend
to
electronic
mail
or
file
encryption
then
it
is
an
improvement
over
the
current
massproduced
standard
civilian
technology
which
with
a
few
exceptions
is
limited
to
easytobreak
inverters
note
that
the
big
issue
for
the
feds
is
the
continued
ability
to
wiretap
before
we
go
off
the
deep
end
with
long
discusions
about
secure
crypto
for
email
and
files
lets
focus
on
this
one
question
that
was
not
asked
in
the
release
is
whether
this
proposal
is
limited
to
telephony
or
if
the
government
intends
to
expand
it
though
i
share
many
of
the
concerns
expressed
by
some
i
find
the
proposal
less
threatening
than
many
others
since
right
now
most
americans
have
no
secure
telephony
and
any
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
leads
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
this
would
also
plug
up
the
security
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phones
reading
between
the
lines
i
infer
that
the
system
is
highly
secure
without
access
to
the
keys
this
would
meet
the
needs
of
us
businesses
confronted
by
rich
and
powerful
adversaries
including
french
and
japanese
security
services
and
rich
japanese
companies
it
allows
the
nsa
to
make
available
some
of
its
better
stuff
while
protecting
law
enforcement
needs
most
legitimate
us
corporations
trust
the
nsa
and
would
be
delighted
to
have
a
highsecurity
system
certified
by
them
even
at
the
price
of
depositing
keys
in
escrow
i
see
no
difficulty
in
creating
a
reliable
escrow
corporations
entrust
their
secrets
to
attorneys
every
day
of
the
week
and
that
system
has
worked
pretty
well
from
my
point
of
view
this
is
a
fair
starting
point
there
are
concerns
that
need
to
be
addressed
including
the
reliability
of
the
escrows
but
in
return
we
get
access
to
highsecurity
crypto
many
have
suggested
that
des
and
other
systems
may
be
breakable
by
the
nsa
and
hence
others
similarly
skilled
and
endowed
there
is
at
least
a
good
possibility
which
should
be
checked
that
the
proposed
system
is
not
so
breakable
it
doesnt
have
to
be
nor
does
it
have
to
have
trapdoors
if
the
government
can
get
the
keys
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
court
order
thus
they
can
protect
legitimate
communications
against
economic
adversaries
while
still
being
able
to
eavesdrop
on
crooks
pursuant
to
a
court
order
in
discussing
this
lets
try
to
avoid
the
nastiness
personal
attacks
and
noise
of
some
previous
threads
this
is
a
substantive
and
technical
issue
and
personal
remarks
have

the

the
key
question
is
whether

encryption

the

is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries

assessment
that
this

is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be

in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the

and
similar

techniques
the
clear
middle
ground
implied
by
these
statements
is
to
say
that
americans
have
the
right
to
clipper
encryption
but
not
to
unbreakable
encryption
this
implies
that
ultimately
nonclipper
strong
encryption
must
become
illegal
with
the
following
logical
consequences
a
using
any
code
designed
to
obscure

which

will
be

would
be
to

once

there
is
no

there

nothing

compell
the

no

there
to

getting

is
actually
pretty
easy
to
do
automatically
on
a

as
opposed
to
storage
where
the
keys
have
to
be
retained
somehow
as
long
as
the
owner
wants
to
be
able
to
retrieve
the
data
the
right
way
to
do
communications
security
is
to
generate
a
random
session
key
with
diffie
hellman
use
it
for
a
while
and
then
destroy
it
once
its
gone
theres
no
getting
it
back
and
no
way
to
decrypt
recordings
of
the
conversation
to
make
sure
you
arent
being
attacked
by
a
man
in
the
middle
you
have
to
authenticate
your
dh
exchanges
the
att
secure
phone
does
this
by
displaying
the
dh
key
so
you
can
compare
them
verbally
over
the
phone
this
is
nice
and
simple
but
it
relies
on
user
awareness
plus
the
inability
of
the
man
in
the
middle
to
duplicate
the
users
voices
a
better
way
is
to
authenticate
the
exchanges
with
rsa
since
youd
never
use
rsa
for
actual
encryption
compromising
your
rsa
secret
key
would
only
allow
someone
to
impersonate
you
in
a
future
conversation
and
even
that
only
until
you
revoke
your
public
key
they
would
still
not
be
able
to
decrypt
recordings
of
prior

the

has
the

call
i
go

buy

to
prevent

with

buying
a

whooa
the

just
became
unsynchronized
when
the

comes
to
listen
in
they
only
receive
gobbledlygook
because
the
secret

registered
under

isnt
the
right
one
that
leads
me
to
conjecture
that
the

isnt
that
secure
there
are
just
two
master

that
work
for
all

to

the

development
and
use
of
advanced

secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global

and
the
need
of

q
does
this
approach
expand
the
authority
of
government
agencies
to
listen
in

a
no
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key

system
q
who
will
run
the
keyescrow
data
banks
a
the
two
keyescrow
data
banks
will
be
run
by
two
independent
entities
at
this
point
the
department
of
justice
and
the
administration
have
yet
to
determine
which
agencies
will
oversee
the
keyescrow
data
banks
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
q
whose
decision
was
it
to
propose
this
product
a
the
national
security
council
the
justice
department
the
commerce
department
and
other
key
agencies
were
involved
in
this
decision
this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the
chip
manufacturer
that
produces
them
q
who
provides
the
clipper
chip
a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their
facility
in
torrance
california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of
these
products
subject
how
do
they
know
what
keys
to
ask
for
re
clipper
this
may
be
a
stupid
question
but
how
does
the
government
know
which
keys
to
ask
for
will
owners
be
required
to
register
their
phones
faxes
modems
etc
and
inform
the
government
when
they
are
moved
to
a
different
phone
number
will
there
be
penalities
if
the
public
does
not
do
this
will
identification
the
national
health
care
id
perhaps
be
required
when
purchasing
a
clipperequipted
phone
or
will
each
chip
transmit
identifying
information
at
the
start
of
a
conversation
identification
which
could
be
used
to
automatically
log
who
calls
whom
the
phone
company
keeps
records
but
this
information
would
be
accessable
by
a
wellplaced
van
near
a
microwave
relay
station
this
raises
the
question
of
how
the
two
phones
agree
on
a
communications
encryption
key
will
it
be
something
that
is
derived
from
information
exchanged
at
the
start
of
the
conversation
and
hence
derivable

re

qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
the
stragegy
of
the
government
is
interesting
the
real
fear
comes
from
them
doing
more
than
this
this
is
a
voluntary
program
and
thus
harder
for
us
to
object
to
on
the
surface
their
strategy
is
a
business
one
rather
than
legal
one
they
are
pushing
to
get
a
standard
in
place
a
secret
standard
and
if
they
get
it
as
a
standard
then
they
will
drive
competitors
out
of
the
market
it
will
be
legal
to
sell
better
untapable
encryption
that
doesnt
have
registered
keys
but
it
will
be
difficult
and
thus
not
a
plan
for
most
phone
companies
you
see
with
clipper
chip
phones
youll
be
able
to
talk
to
any
cellular
company
or
other
phones
or
ports
because
they
will
follow
the
standard
att
has
already
announced
a
clipper
chip
encryption
product
the
government
has
marketed
hard
to
get
major
vendors
to
use
these
chips
if
they
get
enough
market
share
they
will
rule
and
thus
there
will
be
very
little
market
for
systems
that
cant
be
tapped
by
the
police
the
public
isnt
that
concerned
about
it
now
after
all
they
freely
do
calls
that
anybody
with
an
old
tv
can
listen
to
today
they
wont
pay
big
extra
bucks
for
proprietary
phones
that
secure
them
only
from
the
police
well
some
people
will
buy
these
phones
but
they
will
only
work
with
other
proprietary
phones
so
the
market
will
be
small
and
the
phones
expensive
unless
they
are
made
in
numbers
large
enough
to
sell
them
cheap
only
the
mob
will
buy
them
and
this
means
that
the
fbi
will
want
to
track
the
customer
lists
of
better
encryption
phones
because
the
only
reason
a
person
would
want
one
is
to
evade

tantamount

let

and

i
am
outraged
that
my

to

the

my
full
uncooperation

such
as

and
i
call
on
everyone
with

defy

does
not
seem
to

a
subservient
instrument
to

of

hence
anyone
involved
in

in
this
respect
is
wholly
negligent
and
remiss
in
performing
their
lawful
duty
while
encryption
technology
can
help

protect

secrets
and
the
unauthorized

it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug

it

violate

satire
here

if

a
modest
and
reasonable
proposal
so
he
should
find
merit
with
it
nevertheless
cryptography
is
neutral
technology
if
everybody
has
strong
cryptography
including
policemen
bureacrats
businessmen
housewives
thugs
and
hoodlums
we
have
a
sustainable

anything
less
is
an
unworkable
antiegaltarian
arrangement
intrinsically
antithetical
to
american

and
guaranteed
to
collapse
under
its
own
weight
of
inherent
impracticality
we
dont
need
to
compromise
on
issues
of
freedom
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private

the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting

for
too
long
our
government
has
demonstrated
itself
to
be
increasingly
hostile
and
a
serious
obstacle
to
economic
vitality
and
protecting

since
encryption

will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal

the

is
committed
to

that
protect

while
also
protecting

from

who
break

it

and
even
if
by
some
grandiose
miracle
such
a
thing
were
possible
it
would
only
be
an
efficient
way
to
deprive
american
citizens
of
fundamental
and
inalienable
rights
the
administration
has
to
be
committed
to
leaving
private
industries
alone
esp
on
this
issue
the
government
has
no
legitimate
role
in
regulating
the

law
enforcement
agencies
must
be
prepared
to
forfeit

they
are
soon

inevitably
to

disarmed
of
it
q
if
the

were
unable

like
the
one
proposed
would
the

be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict

more
powerful

no
such
laws
can
be
constitutionally
sound

is
equivalent

dont

kind
of
extortion
tends
to
agitate
me
and
others
into
radicalism
i
will
trade

for

the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
if
the

did
say
this
it
would
find
itself
impeached
for
reckless
and
outrageous
disregard
of
essential
established
entrenched
and
explicit
constitutional
privacy

the

would
have
no
legal
standing
whatsoever
such
an
action
would
be
egregiously
illegal
and
criminal
and
wholly
untolerated
and
disregarded
by
vast

nor
is
the
us
saying

the

youre
crazy
if
you
think
pepsico
doesnt

the

in
all

cocacola
is
distributed
in
a
form
of
concentrate
what
the
local
producers
simply
mix
with
water
and
other
simple
ingredients
the
trick
is
to
know
what
is
in
the
concentrate
i
dont
know
if
this
is
still
true
but
at
one
time
cocacola
took
elaborate
measures
to
keep
the
formula
secret
for
instance
several
plants
in
different
cities
each
made
one
of
six
partial
concentrates
which
were
then
shipped
backand
forth
and
remixed
in
a
complicated
scheme
so
that
no
single
plant
made
the
whole
formula
by
now
i
would
guess
that
pepsicos
chemists
would
have

they

run

draw
a

i
was
thinking
about
this
also
its
quite
possible
the
system
transmits
in

the
serial

of
the

being
used
that
way
they
can
start
a

get
the
serial

and
use
the

for
the
first
tap
to
get
the
key
if
they
tap
someone
whos
apparently
using
encryption
but
dont
find
that
prefix
then
theyll
assume
its
an
unauthorized
encryption
scheme
this
doesnt
handle
superencrypted
traffic
if
the

doesnt
impose
any
unfortunate
performance
sideeffects
theres
no
reason
not
to
use
it
to
superencrypt

that
way
your

looks

cryptosystem
a
privatekey
cryptosystem
consists
of
an
encryption
system
e
and
a
decryption
system
d
the
encryption
system
e
is
a
collection
of
functions
ek
indexed
by
keys
k
mapping
some
set
of
plaintexts
p
to
some
set
of
ciphertexts
c
similarly
the
decryption
system
d
is
a
collection
of
functions
dk
such
that
dkekp
p
for
every
plaintext
p
that
is
succesful
decryption
of
ciphertext
into
plaintext
is
accomplished
using
the
same
key
index
as
was
used
for
the
corresponding
encryption
of
plaintext
into
ciphertext
such
systems
wherein
the
same
key
value
is
used
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
are
also
known
as
symmetric
cryptoystems
what
is
an
attack
in
intuitive
terms
a
passive
attack
on
a
cryptosystem
is
any
method
of
starting
with
some
information
about
plaintexts
and
their
corresponding
ciphertexts
under
some
unknown
key
and
figuring
out
more
information
about
the
plaintexts
its
possible
to
state
mathematically
what
this
means
here
we
go
fix
functions
f
g
and
h
of
n
variables
fix
an
encryption
system
e
and
fix
a
distribution
of
plaintexts
and
keys
an
attack
on
e
using
g
assuming
f
giving
h
with
probability
p
is
an
algorithm
a
with
a
pair
f
g
of
inputs
and
one
output
h
such
that
there
is
probability
p
of
computing
h
if
we
have
f
and
g
note
that
this
probability
depends
on
the
distribution
of
the
vector
the
attack
is
trivial
or
pointless
if
there
is
probability
at
least
p
of
computing
h
if
f
and
g
here
range
uniformly
over
the
possible
ciphertexts
and
have
no
particular
relation
to
in
other
words
an
attack
is
trivial
if
it
doesnt
actually
use
the
encryptions
an
attack
is
called
oneciphertext
if
n
twociphertext
if
n
and
so
on
whats
the
advantage
of
formulating
all
this
mathematically
in
basic
cryptology
you
can
never
prove
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secure
read
part
we
keep
saying
a
strong
cryptosystem
must
have
this
property
but
having
this
property
is
no
guarantee
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
in
contrast
the
purpose
of
mathematical
cryptology
is
to
precisely
formulate
and
if
possible
prove
the
statement
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
we
say
for
example
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secure
against
all
passive
attacks
if
any
nontrivial
attack
against
the
system
as
defined
above
is
too
slow
to
be
practical
if
we
can
prove
this
statement
then
we
have
confidence
that
our
cryptosystem
will
resist
any
passive
cryptanalytic
technique
if
we
can
reduce
this
statement
to
some
wellknown
unsolved
problem
then
we
still
have
confidence
that
the
cryptosystem
isnt
easy
to
break
other
parts
of
cryptology
are
also
amenable
to
mathematical
definition
again
the
point
is
to
explicitly
identify
what
assumptions
were
making
and
prove
that
they
produce
the
desired
results
we
can
figure
out
what
it
means
for
a
particular
cryptosystem
to
be
used
properly
it
just
means
that
the
assumptions
are
valid
the
same
methodology
is
useful
for
cryptanalysis
too
the
cryptanalyst
can
take
advantage
of
incorrect
assumptions
often
he
can
try
to
construct
a
proof
of
security
for
a
system
see
where
the
proof
fails
and
use
these
failures
as
the
starting
points
for
his
analysis
why
is
the
onetime
pad
secure
by
definition
the
onetime
pad
is
a
cryptosystem
where
the
plaintexts
ciphertexts
and
keys
are
all
strings
say
byte
strings
of
some
length
m
and
ekp
is
just
the
sum
lets
say
the
exclusive
or
of
k
and
p
it
is
easy
to
prove
mathematically
that
there
are
no
nontrivial
singleciphertext
attacks
on
the
onetime
pad
assuming
a
uniform
distribution
of
keys
note
that
we
dont
have
to
assume
a
uniform
distribution
of
plaintexts
heres
the
proof
let
a
be
an
attack
ie
an
algorithm
taking
two
inputs
f
g
and
producing
one
output
h
with
some
probability
p
that
h
hp
whenever
f
fp
and
g
gekp
ie
g
gk
p
then
because
the
distribution
of
k
is
uniform
and
independent
of
p
the
distribution
of
k
p
must
also
be
uniform
and
independent
of
p
but
also
the
distribution
of
c
is
uniform
and
independent
of
p
hence
there
is
probability
exactly
p
that
h
hp
whenever
f
fp
and
g
gc
over
all
p
and
c
thus
a
fortiori
a
is
trivial
on
the
other
hand
the
onetime
pad
is
not
secure
if
a
key
k
is
used
for
more
than
one
plaintext
ie
there
are
nontrivial
multipleciphertext
attacks
so
to
be
properly
used
a
key
k
must
be
thrown
away
after
one
encryption
the
key
is
also
called
a
pad
this
explains
the
name
onetime
pad
whats
a
ciphertextonly
attack
in
the
notation
above
a
ciphertextonly
attack
is
one
where
f
is
constant
given
only
some
information
about
n
ciphertexts
the
attack
has
to
have
some
chance
of
producing
some
information
about
the
plaintexts
the
attack
is
trivial
if
it
has
just
as
good
a
chance
of
producing
when
given
for
random
for
example
say
gc
c
and
say
hp
is
the
first
bit
of
p
we
can
easily
write
down
an
attackthe
guessing
attack
which
simply
guesses
that
hp
is
this
attack
is
trivial
because
it
doesnt
use
the
ciphertext
it
has
a
fiftyfifty
chance
of
guessing
correctly
no
matter
what
on
the
other
hand
there
is
an
attack
on
rsa
which
produces
one
bit
of
information
about
p
with
success
using
c
if
it
is
fed
a
random
c
then
the
success
rate
drops
to
so
this
is
a
nontrivial
attack
whats
a
knownplaintext
attack
the
classic
knownplaintext
attack
has
and
depending
only
on
in
other
words
given
two
ciphertexts
and
and
one
decryption
the
knownplaintext
attack
should
produce
information
about
the
other
decryption
note
that
knownplaintext
attacks
are
often
defined
in
the
literature
as
producing
information
about
the
key
but
this
is
pointless
the
cryptanalyst
generally
cares
about
the
key
only
insofar
as
it
lets
him
decrypt
further
messages
whats
a
chosenplaintext
attack
a
chosenplaintext
attack
is
the
first
of
an
increasingly
impractical
series
of
active
attacks
on
a
cryptosystem
attacks
where
the
cryptanalyst
feeds
data
to
the
encryptor
these
attacks
dont
fit
into
our
model
of
passive
attacks
explained
above
anyway
a
chosenplaintext
attack
lets
the
cryptanalyst
choose
a
plaintext
and
look
at
the
corresponding
ciphertext
then
repeat
until
he
has
figured
out
how
to
decrypt
any
message
more
absurd
examples
of
this
sort
of
attack
are
the
chosenkey
attack
and
chosensystem
attack
a
much
more
important
form
of
active
attack
is
a
message
corruption
attack
where
the
attacker
tries
to
change
the
ciphertext
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
a
useful
change
in
the
plaintext
there
are
many
easy
ways
to
throw
kinks
into
all
of
these
attacks
for
instance
automatically
encrypting
any
plaintext
p
as
tekhtrprp
where
t
is
a
timekey
sequence
number
chosen
anew
for
each
message
r
is
a
random
number
and
h
is
a
oneway
hash
function
here
comma
means
concatenation
and
plus
means
exclusiveor
in
mathematical
terms
what
can
you
say
about
bruteforce
attacks
consider
the
following
knownplaintext
attack
we
are
given
some
plaintexts
and
ciphertexts
were
also
given
a
ciphertext
cn
we
run
through
every
key
k
when
we
find
k
such
that
ekpi
ci
for
every
i
n
we
print
dkcn
if
n
is
big
enough
that
only
one
key
works
this
attack
will
succeed
on
valid
inputs
all
the
time
while
it
will
produce
correct
results
only
once
in
a
blue
moon
for
random
inputs
thus
this
is
a
nontrivial
attack
its
only
problem
is
that
it
is
very
slow
if
there
are
many
possible
keys
whats
a
keyguessing
attack
whats
entropy
say
somebody
is
using
the
onetime
padbut
isnt
choosing
keys
randomly
and
uniformly
from
all
mbit
messages
as
he
was
supposed
to
for
our
security
proof
in
fact
say
hes
known
to
prefer
keys
which
are
english
words
then
a
cryptanalyst
can
run
through
all
english
words
as
possible
keys
this
attack
will
often
succeed
and
its
much
faster
than
a
bruteforce
search
of
the
entire
keyspace
we
can
measure
how

writes
someone
awhile
back
was
looking
for
a
way
to
decrypt
wordperfect
document
files
and
i
think
i
have
a
solution
there
is
a
software
company
named
accessdata

south
orem
ut
that
has
a
software
package
that
will
decrypt
any
wordperfect
lotus
quatropro
ms
excel
and
paradox
files
the
cost
of
the
package
is
steep
prices
but
if
you
think
your
pw
key
is
less
than
characters
or
char
give
them
a
call
and
ask
for
the
free
demo

the
demo
disk
will
decrypt
files
that
have
a
char
or
less
pw
key
how
do
i
break
a
vigenere
repeatedkey
cipher
a
repeatedkey
cipher
where
the
ciphertext
is
something
like
the
plaintext
xor
keykeykeykey
and
so
on
is
called
a
vigenere
cipher
if
the
key
is
not
too
long
and
the
plaintext
is
in
english
do
the
following
discover
the
length
of
the
key
by
counting
coincidences
see
gaines
sinkov
trying
each
displacement
of
the
ciphertext
against
itself
count
those
bytes
which
are
equal
if
the
two
ciphertext
portions
have
used
the
same
key
something
over
of
the
bytes
will
be
equal
if
they
have
used
different
key
then
less
than
will
be
equal
assuming
random
bytes
of
key
covering
normal
ascii
text
the
smallest
displacement
which
indicates
an
equal
key
is
the
length
of
the
repeated
key
shift
the
text
by
that
length
and
xor
it
with
itself
this
removes
the
key
and
leaves
you
with
text
xored
with
itself
since
english
has
about
bit
of
real
information
per
byte
streams
of
text
xored
together
has
bits
of
info
per
byte
providing
plenty
of
redundancy
for
choosing
a
unique
decryption
and
in
fact
one
stream
of
text
xored
with
itself
has
just
bit
per
byte
if
the
key
is
short
it
might
be
even
easier
to
treat
this
as
a
standard
polyalphabetic
substitution
all
the
old
cryptanalysis
texts
show
how
to
break
those
its
possible
with
those
methods

expert

primarily
in

ripem
is
most

since
it
uses
the
rsaref
which
is
freely
available
within
the
usa
but
not
available
for

outside

since
both

use

pgp
used

ripem
uses
des

be

no

cbw

how
do
i
use
compression
with
encryption
a
number
of
people
have
proposed
doing
perfect
compression
followed
by
some
simple
encryption
method
eg
xor
with
a
repeated
key
unfortunately
you
can
only
compress
perfectly
if
you
know
the
exact
distribution
of
possible
inputs
for
all
practical
purposes
its
impossible
to
describe
the
typical
english
text
beyond
coarse
characteristics
such
as
singleletter
frequencies
you
can
build
up
more
and
more
sophisticated
models
of
your
inputs
but
if
the
enemy
has
a
slightly
more
accurate
model
hell
be
able
to
find
some
redundancy
in
your
compressed
output
note
that
nearly
all
practical
compression
schemes
unless
they
have
been
designed
with
cryptography
in
mind
produce
output
that
actually
starts
off
with
high
redundancy
for
example
the
output
of
unix
compress
begins
with
a
wellknown
threebyte
magic
number
that
can
serve
as
an
entering
wedge
for
cryptanalysis
this
is
not
to
say
that
compression
before
encryption
is
inherently
a
bad
idea
it
just
has
to
be
done
very
very
carefully
and
by
no
means
removes
the
need
for
strong
encryption
compression
after
encryption
is
silly
is
there
an
unbreakable
cipher
yes
the
onetime
pad
is
unbreakable
see
part
unfortunately
the
onetime
pad
requires
secure
distribution
of
as
much
key
material
as
plaintext
of
course
a
cryptosystem
need
not
be
utterly
unbreakable
to
be
useful
rather
it
needs
to
be
strong
enough
to
resist
attacks
by
likely
enemies
for
whatever
length
of
time
the
data
it
protects
is
expected
to
remain
valid
what
does
random
mean
in
cryptography
cryptographic
applications
demand
much
more
out
of
a
pseudorandom
number
generator
than
most
applications
for
a
source
of
bits
to
be
cryptographically
random
it
must
be
computationally
impossible
to
predict
what
the
nth
random
bit
will
be
given
complete
knowledge
of
the
algorithm
or
hardware
generating
the
stream
and
the
sequence
of
through
bits
for
all
n
up
to
the
lifetime
of
the
source
a
software
generator
also
known
as
pseudorandom
has
the
function
of
expanding
a
truly
random
seed
to
a
longer
string
of
apparently
random
bits
this
seed
must
be
large
enough
not
to
be
guessed
by
the
opponent
ideally
it
should
also
be
truly
random
perhaps
generated
by
a
hardware
random
number
source
those
who
have
sparcstation
workstations
could
for
example
generate
random
numbers
using
the
audio
input
device
as
a
source
of
entropy
by
not
connecting
anything
to
it
for
example
cat
devaudio
compress
foo
gives
a
file
of
high
entropy
not
random
but
with
much
randomness
in
it
one
can
then
encrypt
that
file
using
part
of
itself
as
a
key
for
example
to
convert
that
seed
entropy
into
a
pseudorandom
string
when
looking
for
hardware
devices
to
provide
this
entropy
it
is
important
really
to
measure
the
entropy
rather
than
just
assume
that
because
it
looks
complicated
to
a
human
it
must
be
random
for
example
disk
operation
completion
times
sound
like
they
might
be
unpredictable
to
many
people
but
a
spinning
disk
is
much
like
a
clock
and
its
output
completion
times
are
relatively
low
in
entropy
what
is
the
unicity
point
aka
unicity
distance
see
the
unicity
distance
is
an
approximation
to
that
amount
of
ciphertext
such
that
the
sum
of
the
real
information
entropy
in
the
corresponding
source
text
and
encryption
key
equals
the
number
of
ciphertext
bits
used
ciphertexts
significantly
longer
than
this
can
be
shown
probably
to
have
a
unique
decipherment
this
is
used
to
back
up
a
claim
of
the
validity
of
a
ciphertextonly
cryptanalysis
ciphertexts
significantly
shorter
than
this
are
likely
to
have
multiple
equally
valid
decryptions
and
therefore
to
gain
security
from
the
opponents
difficulty
choosing
the
correct
one
unicity
distance
like
all
statistical
or
informationtheoretic
measures
does
not
make
deterministic
predictions
but
rather
gives
probabilistic
results
namely
the
minimum
amount
of
ciphertext
for
which
it
is
likely
that
there
is
only
a
single
intelligible
plaintext
corresponding
to
the
ciphertext
when
all
possible
keys
are
tried
for
the
decryption
working
cryptologists
dont
normally
deal
with
unicity
distance
as
such
instead
they
directly
determine
the
likelihood
of
events
of
interest
let
the
unicity
distance
of
a
cipher
be
d
characters
if
fewer
than
d
ciphertext
characters
have
been
intercepted
then
there
is
not
enough
information
to
distinguish
the
real
key
from
a
set
of
possible
keys
des
has
a
unicity
distance
of
characters
which
is
less
than
ciphertext
blocks
each
block
corresponds
to
ascii
characters
this
may
seem
alarmingly
low
at
first
but
the
unicity
distance
gives
no
indication
of
the
computational
work
required
to
find
the
key
after
approximately
d
characters
have
been
intercepted
in
fact
actual
cryptanalysis
seldom
proceeds
along
the
lines
used
in
discussing
unicity
distance
like
other
measures
such
as
key
size
unicity
distance
is
something
that
guarantees
insecurity
if
its
too
small
but
doesnt
guarantee
security
if
its
high
few
practical
cryptosystems
are
absolutely
impervious
to
analysis
all
manner
of
characteristics
might
serve
as
entering
wedges
to
crack
some
cipher
messages
however
similar
informationtheoretic
considerations
are
occasionally
useful
for
example
to
determine
a
recommended
key
change
interval
for
a
particular
cryptosystem
cryptanalysts
also
employ
a
variety
of
statistical
and
informationtheoretic
tests
to
help
guide
the
analysis
in
the
most
promising
directions
unfortunately
most
literature
on
the
application
of
information
statistics
to
cryptanalysis
remains
classified
even
the
seminal
work
of
alan
turing
see
for
some
insight
into
the
possibilities
see
and
what
is
key
management
and
why
is
it
important
one
of
the
fundamental
axioms
of
cryptography
is
that
the
enemy
is
in
full
possession
of
the
details
of
the
general
cryptographic
system
and
lacks
only
the
specific
key
data
employed
in
the
encryption
of
course
one
would
assume
that
the
cia
does
not
make
a
habit
of
telling
mossad
about
its
cryptosystems
but
mossad
probably
finds
out
anyway
repeated
use
of
a
finite
amount
of
key
provides
redundancy
that
can
eventually
facilitate
cryptanalytic
progress
thus
especially
in
modern
communication
systems
where
vast
amounts
of
information
are
transferred
both
parties
must
have
not
only
a
sound
cryptosystem
but
also
enough
key
material
to
cover
the
traffic
key
management
refers
to
the
distribution
authentication
and
handling
of
keys
a
publicly
accessible
example
of
modern
key
management
technology
is
the
stu
iii
secure
telephone
unit
which
for
classified
use
employs
individual
coded
crypto
ignition
keys
and
a
central
key
management
center
operated
by
nsa
there
is
a
hierarchy
in
that
certain
ciks
are
used
by
authorized
cryptographic
control
personnel
to
validate
the
issuance
of
individual
traffic
keys
and
to
perform
installationmaintenance
functions
such
as
the
reporting
of
lost
ciks
this
should
give
an
inkling
of
the
extent
of
the
key
management
problem
for
publickey
systems
there
are
several
related
issues
many
having
to
do
with
whom
do
you
trust
can
i
use
pseudorandom
or
chaotic
numbers
as
a
key
stream
chaotic
equations
and
fractals
produce
an
apparent
randomness
from
relatively
compact
generators
perhaps
the
simplest
example
is
a
linear
congruential
sequence
one
of
the
most
popular
types
of
random
number
generators
where
there
is
no
obvious
dependence
between
seeds
and
outputs
unfortunately
the
graph
of
any
such
sequence
will
in
a
high
enough
dimension
show
up
as
a
regular
lattice
mathematically
this
lattice
corresponds
to
structure
which
is
notoriously
easy
for
cryptanalysts
to
exploit
more
complicated
generators
have
more
complicated
structure
which
is
why
they
make
interesting
pictures
but
a
cryptographically
strong
sequence
will
have
no
computable
structure
at
all
see
exercise
and
what
is
the
correct
frequency
list
for
english
letters
there
are
three
answers
to
this
question
each
slightly
deeper
than
the
one
before
you
can
find
the
first
answer
in
various
books
namely
a
frequency
list
computed
directly
from
a
certain
sample
of
english
text
of
course
any
such
list
will
be
correctly
computed
but
exactly
which
list
you
get
depends
on
which
sample
was
taken
the
second
answer
is
that
the
question
doesnt
make
sense
what
do
you
mean
by
english
letters
the
english
language
is
not
a
fixed
finite
closed
object
that
can
be
exactly
characterized
it
has
changed
over
time
it
is
different
between
different
authors
any
particular
message
will
have
different
statistics
from
those
of
the
language
as
a
whole
the
third
answer
is
that
yes
no
particular
message
is
going
to
have
exactly
the
same
characteristics
as
english
in
general
but
for
all
reasonable
statistical
uses
these
slight
discrepancies
wont
matter
in
fact
theres
an
entire
field
called
bayesian
statistics
other
buzzwords
are
maximum
entropy
methods
and
maximum
likelihood
estimation
which
studies
questions
like
whats
the
chance
that
a
text
with
these
letter
frequencies
is
in
english
and
comes
up
with
reasonably
robust
answers
so
make
your
own
list
from
your
own
samples
of
english
text
it
will
be
good
enough
for
practical
work
if
you
use
it
properly
what
is
the
enigma
for
a
project
in
data
security
we
are
looking
for
sources
of
information
about
the
german
enigma
code
and
how
it
was
broken
by
the
british
during
wwii
see
how
do
i
shuffle
cards
card
shuffling
is
a
special
case
of
the
permutation
of
an
array
of
values
using
a
random
or
pseudorandom
function
all
possible
output
permutations
of
this
process
should
be
equally
likely
to
do
this
you
need
a
random
function
modranx
which
will
produce
a
uniformly
distributed
random
integer
in
the
interval
given
that
function
you
can
shuffle
with
the
following
c
code
assuming
arrlth
is
the
length
of
array
arr
and
swap
interchanges
values
at
the
two
addresses
given
for
n
n
n
swap
arrmodran
arrn
modranx
can
not
be
achieved
exactly
with
a
simple
ranno
x
since
rannos
interval
may
not
be
divisible
by
x
although
in
most
cases
the
error
will
be
very
small
to
cover
this
case
one
can
take
rannos
modulus
mod
x
call
that
number
y
and
if
ranno
returns
a
value
less
than
y
go
back
and

another
ranno
value
can
i
foil
sw
pirates
by
encrypting
my
cdrom
someone
will
frequently
express
the
desire
to
publish
a
cdrom
with
possibly
multiple
pieces
of
software
perhaps
with
each
encrypted
separately
and
will
want
to
use
different
keys
for
each
user
perhaps
even
good
for
only
a
limited
period
of
time
in
order
to
avoid
piracy
as
far
as
we
know
this
is
impossible
since
there
is
nothing
in
standard
pc
or
workstation
hardware
which
uniquely
identifies
the
user
at
the
keyboard
if
there
were
such
an
identification
then
the
cdrom
could
be
encrypted
with
a
key
based
in
part
on
the
one
sold
to
the
user
and
in
part
on
the
unique
identifier
however
in
this
case
the
cdrom
is
one
of
a
kind
and
that
defeats
the
intended
purpose
if
the
cdrom
is
to
be
encrypted
once
and
then
mass
produced
there
must
be
a
key
or
set
of
keys
for
that
encryption
produced
at
some
stage
in
the
process
that
key
is
useable
with
any
copy
of
the
cdroms
data
the
pirate
needs
only
to
isolate
that
key
and
sell

plaintext

encryption
key
the
story
begins
when
julius
caesar
sent
messages
to
his
trusted
acquaintances
he
didnt
trust
the
messengers
so
he
replaced
every
a
by
a
c
every
b
by
a
d
and
so
on
through
the
alphabet
only
someone
who
knew
the
shift
by
rule
could
decipher
his
messages
a
cryptosystem
or
cipher
system
is
a
method
of
disguising
messages
so
that
only
certain
people
can
see
through
the
disguise
cryptography
is
the
art
of
creating
and
using
cryptosystems
cryptanalysis
is
the
art
of
breaking
cryptosystemsseeing
through
the
disguise
even
when
youre
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
cryptology
is
the
study
of
both
cryptography
and
cryptanalysis
the
original
message
is
called
a
plaintext
the
disguised
message
is
called
a
ciphertext
encryption
means
any
procedure
to
convert
plaintext
into
ciphertext
decryption
means
any
procedure
to
convert
ciphertext
into
plaintext
a
cryptosystem
is
usually
a
whole
collection
of
algorithms
the
algorithms
are
labelled
the
labels
are
called
keys
for
instance
caesar
probably
used
shift
by
n
encryption
for
several
different
values
of
n
its
natural
to
say
that
n
is
the
key
here
the
people
who
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
see
through
the
disguise
are
called
recipients
other
people
are
enemies
opponents
interlopers
eavesdroppers
or
third
parties
what
references
can
i
start
with
to
learn
cryptology
for
an
introduction
to
technical
matter
the
survey
articles
given
in
part
are
the
best
place
to
begin
as
they
are
in
general
concise
authored
by
competent
people
and
well
written
however
these
articles
are
mostly
concerned
with
cryptology
as
it
has
developed
in
the
last
years
or
so
and
are
more

in

and
technical
detail
of
cryptology
up
to
the
introductory
cryptanalysis
can
be
learned
from
gaines
or
sinkov
this
is
recommended
especially
for
people
who
want
to
devise
their
own
encryption
algorithms
since
it
is
a
common
mistake
to
try
to
make
a
system
before
knowing
how
to
break
one
the
selection
of
an
algorithm
for
the
des
drew
the
attention
of
many
public
researchers
to
problems
in
cryptology
consequently
several
textbooks
and
books
to
serve
as
texts
have
appeared
the
book
of
denning
gives
a
good
introduction
to
a
broad
range
of
security
including
encryption
algorithms
database
security
access
control
and
formal
models
of
security
similar
comments
apply
to
the
books
of
price
davies
and
pfleeger
the
books
of
konheim
and
meyer
matyas
are
quite
technical
books
both
konheim

involved
in

of

of

konheims
book
is
quite
mathematical
with
detailed
analyses
of
many
classical

meyer
and
matyas
concentrate
on
modern
cryptographic
methods
especially
pertaining
to
key
management
and
the
integration
of
security
facilities
into
computer
systems
and

the

and
koblitz

on
the
application
of
number
theory
and
algebra
to

how

about
cryptanalysis
classical
cryptanalysis
involves
an
interesting
combination
of
analytical
reasoning
application
of
mathematical
tools
pattern
finding
patience
determination
and
luck
the
best
available
textbooks
on
the
subject
are
the
military
cryptanalytics
series
it
is
clear
that
proficiency
in
cryptanalysis
is
for
the
most
part
gained
through
the
attempted
solution
of
given
systems
such
experience
is
considered
so
valuable
that
some
of
the
cryptanalyses
performed
during
wwii
by
the
allies
are
still
classified
modern
publickey
cryptanalysis
may
consist
of
factoring
an
integer
or
taking
a
discrete
logarithm
these
are
not

what
is
a
bruteforce
search
and
what
is
its
cryptographic
relevance
in
a
nutshell
if
fx
y
and
you
know
y
and
can
compute
f
you
can
find
x
by
trying
every
possible
x
thats
bruteforce
search
example
say
a
cryptanalyst
has
found
a
plaintext
and
a
corresponding
ciphertext
but
doesnt
know
the
key
he
can
simply
try
encrypting
the
plaintext
using
each
possible
key
until
the
ciphertext
matchesor
decrypting
the
ciphertext
to
match
the
plaintext
whichever
is
faster
every
welldesigned
cryptosystem
has
such
a
large
key
space
that
this
bruteforce
search
is
impractical
advances
in
technology
sometimes
change
what
is
considered
practical
for
example
des
which
has
been
in
use
for
over
years
now
has
or
about
possible
keys
a
computation
with
this
many
operations
was
certainly
unlikely
for
most
users
in
the
the
situation
is
very
different
today
given
the
dramatic
decrease
in
cost
per
processor
operation
massively
parallel
machines
threaten
the
security
of
des
against
brute
force
search
some
scenarios
are
described
by
garron
and
outerbridge
one
phase
of
a
more
sophisticated
cryptanalysis
may
involve
a
bruteforce
search
of
some
manageably
small
space
of
possibilities
what
are
some
properties
satisfied
by
every
strong
cryptosystem
the
security
of
a
strong
system
resides
with
the
secrecy
of
the
key
rather
than
with
an
attempt
to
keep
the
algorithm
itself
secret
a
strong
cryptosystem
has
a
large
keyspace
as
mentioned
above
the
unicity
distance
is
a
measure
which
gives
the
minimum
amount
of
ciphertext
that
must
be
intercepted
to
uniquely
identify
the
key
and
if
for
some
key
the
unicity
distance
is
much
longer
than
the
amount
of
ciphertext
you
intend
to
encrypt
under
that
key
the
system
is
probably
strong
a
strong
cryptosystem
will
certainly
produce
ciphertext
which
appears
random
to
all
standard
statistical
tests
see
for
example
a
strong
cryptosystem
will
resist
all
known
previous
attacks
a
system
which
has
never
been
subjected
to
scrutiny
is
suspect
if
a
system
passes
all
the
tests
mentioned
above
is
it
necessarily
strong
certainly
not
many
weak
cryptosystems
looked
good
at
first
however
sometimes
it
is
possible
to
show
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
by
mathematical
proof
if
joe
can
break
this
system
then
he
can
also
solve
the
wellknown
difficult
problem
of
factoring
integers
see
part
failing
that
its
a
crap
shoot
if
a
cryptosystem
is
theoretically
unbreakable
then
is
it
guaranteed
analysisproof
in
practice
cryptanalytic
methods
include
what
is
known
as
practical
cryptanalysis
the
enemy
doesnt
have
to
just
stare
at
your
ciphertext
until
he
figures
out
the
plaintext
for
instance
he
might
assume
cribsstretches
of
probable
plaintext
if
the
crib
is
correct
then
he
might
be
able
to
deduce
the
key
and
then
decipher
the
rest
of
the
message
or
he
might
exploit
isologsthe
same
plaintext
enciphered
in
several
cryptosystems
or
several
keys
thus
he
might
obtain
solutions
even
when
cryptanalytic
theory
says
he
doesnt
have
a
chance
sometimes
cryptosystems
malfunction
or
are
misused
the
onetime
pad
for
example
loses
all
security
if
it
is
used
more
than
once
even
chosenplaintext
attacks
where
the
enemy
somehow
feeds
plaintext
into
the
encryptor
until
he
can
deduce
the
key

been
employed
see
why
are
many
people
still
using
cryptosystems
that
are
relatively
easy
to
break
some
dont
know
any
better
often
amateurs
think
they
can
design
secure
systems
and
are
not
aware
of
what
an

release
your

to
the

your

i
am
sure
most
of
the
time
they

their

will
not
be

as
the

what
this
effectively
means
is
that
if
they
perform
a

on
you
at
the
end
of
the

they
should
be
obligated
to
inform
you

this
raises
further
issues
about

areas
but
is
it
any
worse
than
the

it
becomes
much
worse
of
course
if
the

then
uses
this

argue

this
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of

i
think
the

and
it
may
also
become

worse

if

not
adequate

gibberish

should

the

how
any
message
key
is
distributed

only

key
is
kept

are
some
systematic

unsystematic
ways
to
take
reasonably
long
ciphertexts

even

what
makes
a
product
cipher
secure
nobody
knows
how
to
prove
mathematically
that
a
product
cipher
is
completely
secure
so
in
practice
one
begins
by
demonstrating
that
the
cipher
looks
highly
random
for
example
the
cipher
must
be
nonlinear
and
it
must
produce
ciphertext
which
functionally
depends
on
every
bit
of
the
plaintext
and
the
key
meyer
has
shown
that
at
least
rounds
of
des
are
required
to
guarantee
such
a
dependence
in
this
sense
a
product
cipher
should
act
as
a
mixing
function
which
combines
the
plaintext
key
and
ciphertext
in
a
complex
nonlinear
fashion
the
fixed
perround
substitutions
of
the
product
cipher
are
referred
to
as
sboxes
for
example
lucifer
has
sboxes
and
des
has
sboxes
the
nonlinearity
of
a
product
cipher
reduces
to
a
careful
design
of
these
sboxes
a
list
of
partial
design
criteria
for
the
sboxes
of

a
random
mapping
from
plaintexts
to
ciphertexts
then
we
would
expect
to
generate
a
large
subset
of
coppersmith
and
grossman
have
shown
that
a
very
simple
product
cipher
can
generate
the
alternating
group
given
a
sufficient
number
of
rounds
the
alternating
group
is
half
of
the
symmetric
group
it
consists
of
all
even
permutations
ie
all
permutations
which
can
be
written
as
an
even
number
of
swaps
even
and
goldreich
were
able
to
extend
these
results
to
show
that
feistel
ciphers
can
generate
given
a
sufficient
number
of
rounds
the
security
of
multiple
encipherment
also
depends
on
the
grouptheoretic
properties
of
a
cipher
multiple
encipherment
is
an
extension
over
single
encipherment
if
for
keys
there
does
not
exist
a
third
key
such
that
which
indicates
that
encrypting
twice
with
two
independent
keys
is
equal
to
a
single
encryption
under
the
third
key
if
for
every
there
exists
a
such
that
eq
is
true
then
we
say
that
e
is
a
group
this
question
of
whether
des
is
a
group
under
this
definition
was
extensively
studied
by
sherman
kaliski
and
rivest
in
their
paper
they
give
strong
evidence
for
the
hypothesis
that
des
is
not
a
group
in
fact
des
is
not
a
group
what
can
be
proven
about
the
security
of
a
product
cipher
recall
from
above
that
pk
is
a
permutation
produced
by
e
under
some
key
k
the
goal
of
the
designer
of
e
is
to
ensure
that
pk
appears
to
be
a
random
element
of
the
symmetric
group
let
r
be
an
element
of
selected
randomly
we
will
say
that
pk
and
r
are
indistinguishable
if
an
observer
given
pk
and
r
in
some
order
cannot
distinguish
between
these
two
permutations
in
polynomial
time
that
is
with
time
bounded
resources
the
observer
cannot
determine
which
of
the
permutations
is
produced
by
e
the
optimal
decision
is
no
better
than
simply
guessing
luby
and
rackoff
have
shown
that
a
class
of
feistel
ciphers
are
secure
in
this
sense
when
the
round
mapping
is
replaced
by
random
boolean
functions
how
are
block
ciphers
used
to
encrypt
data
longer
than
the
block
size
there
are
four
standard
modes
of
operation
and
numerous
nonstandard
ones
as
well
the
standard
modes
of
operation
are
defined
in
the

the

about

below
for
more
details
although
they
are
defined
for
the
des
block
cipher
the
modes
of
operation
can
be
used
with
any
block
cipher
can
symmetric
block
ciphers
be
used
for
message
authentication
one
may
use
a
symmetric
cryptosystem
block
cipher
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
did
or
did
not
generate
a
message
and
to
prove
to
himself
whether
his
message
was
altered
or
unaltered
since
generation
but
one
cannot
prove
these
things
to
another
without
revealing
the
key
and
thereafter
that
key
cannot
be
used
to
prove
anything
about
any

where
each

instance
has
its

and
iv
for

and
tran
has
been
posted
on
scicrypt
it
is
a
largeblock
transposition
program
taking
its
key
from
the
data
stream
itself
so
that
it
is
not
an
encryption
program
on
its
own
part
what
is
differential
cryptanalysis
differential
cryptanalysis
is
a
statistical
attack
that
can
be
applied
to
any
iterated
mapping
ie
any
mapping
which
is
based
on
a
repeated
round
function
the
method
was
recently
popularized
by
biham
and
shamir
but
coppersmith
has
remarked
that
the
sboxes
of
des
were
optimized
against
this
attack
some
years
ago
this
method
has
proved
effective
against
several
product
ciphers
notably
feal
differential
cryptanalysis
is
based
on
observing
a
large
number
of
ciphertexts
y
y
whose
corresponding
plaintexts
x
x
satisfy
a
known
difference
d
xx
where
is
componentwise
xor
in
the
basic
bihamshamir
attack
such
plaintext
pairs
are
required
to
determine
the
key
for
des
substantially
fewer
pairs
are
required
if
des
is
truncated
to
or
rounds
in
these
cases
the
actual
key
can
be
recovered
in
a
matter
of
minutes
using
a
few
thousand
pairs
for
full
des
this
attack
is
impractical
because
it
requires
so
many
known
plaintexts
the
work
of
biham
and
shamir
on
des
revealed
several
startling
observations
on
the
algorithm
most
importantly
if
the
key
schedule
was
removed
from
des
and
a
key
was
used
the
key
could
be
recovered
in
less
than
steps
thus
independent
subkeys
do
not
add
substantial
security
to
des
further
the
sboxes
of
des
are
extremely
sensitive
in
that
changing
even
single
entries
in
these
tables
yields
significant
improvement
in
the
differential
attack
adi
shamir
is
quoted
to
say
nytimes
oct
i
would
say
that
contrary
to
what
some
people
believe
there
is
no
evidence
of
tampering
with
the
des
so
that
the
basic
design
was
weakened
how
was
nsa
involved
in
the
design
of
des
according
to
kinnucan
tuchman
a
member
of
the
group
that
developed
des
at
ibm
is
quoted
as
saying
we
developed
the
des
algorithm
entirely
within
ibm
using
ibmers
the
nsa
did
not
dictate
a
single
wire
tuchman
and
meyer
another
developer
of
des
spent
a
year
breaking
ciphers
and
finding
weaknesses
in
lucifer
they
then
spent
two
years
strengthening
lucifer
their
basic
approach
was
to
look
for
strong
substitution
permutation
and
key
scheduling
functions
ibm
has
classified
the
notes
containing
the
selection
criteria
at
the
request
of
the
nsa
the
nsa
told
us
we
had
inadvertently
reinvented
some
of
the
deep
secrets
it
uses
to
make
its
own
algorithms
explains
tuchman
on
the
other
hand

convinced
ibm
that
a
reduced
keysize
was
sufficient
indirectly
assisted
in
the
development

and
certified
that
the
final
des
algorithm
was
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
free
from
any
statistical
or
mathematical
weakness
clearly
the
key
size
was
reduced
at
the
insistence
of
the
nsa
the
article
further
states
that
the
nsa
did
not
tamper
with
the

itself
just

unfortunately
nobody
has
the

idea
how
to
prove
that
factorizationor
any
realistic

at
all
for
that
matteris
inherently
slow
it
is
easy
to
formalize
what
we
mean
by
rsa
isisnt
strong
but
as
hendrik
w
lenstra
jr
says
exact
definitions
appear
to
be
necessary
only
when
one
wishes
to
prove
that
algorithms
with
certain
properties
do
not
exist
and
theoretical
computer
science
is
notoriously
lacking
in
such
negative
results
how
fast
can
people
factor
numbers
it
depends
on
the
size
of
the
numbers
in
october
arjen
lenstra
and
dan
bernstein
factored
into
primes
using
about
three
weeks
of
maspar
time
the
maspar
is
a
simd
machine
each
processor
can
add
about
integers
per
second
the
algorithm
there
is
called
the
number
field
sieve
it
is
quite
a
bit
faster
for
special
numbers
like
than
for
general
numbers
n
but
it
takes
time
only
about
n
log
n
in
any
case
an
older
and
more
popular
method
for
smaller
numbers
is
the
multiple
polynomial
quadratic
sieve
which
takes
time
n
log
nfaster
than
the
number
field
sieve
for
small
n
but
slower
for
large
n
the
breakeven
point
is
somewhere
between
and
digits
depending
on
the
implementations
factorization
is
a
fastmoving
fieldthe
state
of
the
art
just
a
few
years
ago
was
nowhere
near
as
good
as
it
is
now
if
no
new
methods
are
developed
then
rsa
keys
will
always
be
safe
from
factorization
but
one
cant
predict
the
future
before
the
number
field
sieve
was
found
many
people
conjectured
that
the
quadratic
sieve
was
asymptotically
as
fast
as
any
factoring
method
could
be
what
about
other
publickey
cryptosystems
weve
talked
about
rsa
because
its
well
known
and
easy
to
describe
but
there
are
lots
of
other
publickey
systems
around
many
of
which
are
faster
than
rsa
or
depend
on
problems
more
widely
believed
to
be
difficult
this
has
been
just
a
brief
introduction
if
you
really

what

what
is
a
oneway
hash
function
a
typical
oneway
hash
function
takes
a
variablelength
message
and
produces
a
fixedlength
hash
given
the
hash
it
is
computationally
impossible
to
find
a
message
with
that
hash
in
fact
one
cant
determine
any
usable
information
about
a
message
with
that
hash
not
even
a
single
bit
for
some
oneway
hash
functions
its
also
computationally
impossible
to
determine
two
messages
which
produce
the
same
hash
a
oneway
hash
function
can
be
private
or
public
just
like
an
encryption
function
heres
one
application
of
a
public
oneway
hash
function
like
or
snefru
most
publickey
signature
systems
are
relatively
slow
to
sign
a
long
message
may
take
longer
than
the
user
is
willing
to
wait
solution
compute
the
oneway
hash
of
the
message
and
sign
the
hash
which
is
short
now
anyone
who
wants
to
verify
the
signature
can
do
the
same
thing
another
name
for
oneway
hash
function
is
message
digest
function
what
is
the
difference
between
public
private
secret
shared
etc
there
is
a
horrendous
mishmash
of
terminology
in
the
literature
for
a
very
small
set
of
concepts
when
an
algorithm
depends
on
a
key
which
isnt
published
we
call
it
a
private
algorithm
otherwise
we
call
it
a
public
algorithm
we
have
encryption
functions
e
and
decryption
functions
d
so
that
dem
m

we
also

a
publickey
cryptosystem
has
public
encryption
and
private
decryption
checksums
such
as
the
application
mentioned
in
the
previous
question
have
public
hashing
and
public
verification
digital
signature
functions
have
private
hashing
and
public
verification
only
one
person
can
produce
the
hash
for
a
message
but
everyone
can
verify
that
the
hash
is
correct
obviously
when
an
algorithm
depends
on
a
private
key
its
meant
to
be
unusable
by
anyone
who
doesnt
have
the
key
theres
no
real
difference
between
a
shared
key
and
a
private
key
a
shared
key
isnt
published
so
its
private
if
you

about

what
is
the
national
security
agency
nsa
the
nsa
is
the
official
security
body
of
the
us
government
it
was
given
its
charter
by
president
truman
in
the
late
and
has
continued
research
in
cryptology
till
the
present
the
nsa
is
known
to
be
the
largest
employer
of
mathematicians
in
the
world
and
is
also
the
largest
purchaser
of
computer
hardware
in
the
world
governments
in
general
have
always
been
prime
employers
of
cryptologists
the
nsa
probably
possesses
cryptographic
expertise
many
years
ahead
of
the
public
state
of
the
art
and
can
undoubtedly
break
many
of
the
systems
used
in
practice
but
for
reasons
of
national
security
almost
all
information
about
the
nsa
is
classified
bamfords
book
bamfd
gives
a
history
of
the
people
and
operations
of
the
nsa
the
following
quote
from
massey
highlights
the
difference
between
public
and
private
research
in
cryptography
if
one
regards
cryptology
as
the
prerogative
of
government
one
accepts
that
most
cryptologic
research
will
be
conducted
behind
closed
doors
without
doubt
the
number
of
workers
engaged
today
in
such
secret
research
in
cryptology
far
exceeds
that
of
those
engaged
in
open
research
in
cryptology
for
only
about
years
has
there
in
fact
been
widespread
open
research
in
cryptology
there
have
been
and
will
continue
to
be
conflicts
between
these
two
research
communities
open
research
is
common
quest
for
knowledge
that
depends
for
its
vitality
on
the
open
exchange
of
ideas
via
conference
presentations
and
publications
in
scholarly
journals
but
can
a
government
agency
charged
with
responsibilities
of
breaking
the
ciphers
of
other
nations
countenance
the
publication
of
a
cipher
that
it
cannot
break
can
a
researcher
in
good
conscience
publish
such
a
cipher
that
might
undermine
the
effectiveness
of
his
own
governments
codebreakers
one
might
argue
that
publication
of
a
provablysecure
cipher
would
force
all
governments
to
behave
like
stimsons
gentlemen
but
one
must
be
aware
that
open
research
in
cryptography
is
fraught
with
political
and
ethical
considerations
of
a
severity
than
in
most
scientific
fields
the
wonder
is
not
that
some
conflicts
have
occurred
between
government
agencies
and
open
researchers
in
cryptology
but
rather
that
these
conflicts
at
least
those
of
which
we
are
aware
have
been
so
few
and
so
mild
what
are
the
us
export
regulations
in
a
nutshell
there
are
two
government
agencies
which
control
export
of
encryption
software
one
is
the
bureau
of
export
administration
bxa
in
the
department
of
commerce
authorized
by
the
export
administration
regulations
ear
another
is
the
office
of
defense
trade
controls
dtc
in
the
state
department
authorized
by
the
international
traffic
in
arms
regulations
itar
as
a
rule
of
thumb
bxa
which
works
with
cocom
has
less
stringent
requirements
but
dtc
which
takes
orders
from
nsa
wants
to
see
everything
first
and
can
refuse
to
transfer
jurisdiction
to
bxa
the
newsgroup

many
interesting
discussions
on
the
laws
surrounding
cryptographic
export
what

think
about
those

thanks
for
the
pointer
it
was
good

liked
the
idea
of
using
several

strong
mixing
function
however
unless

missed
something
the
only
source
they
suggested
aside

seems
available

unguessable
by
an
intruder
when

is
io
buffers
related

i
believe
my
solution
basically
uses
that
strategy
without
requiring
me
to
reach
into
the
kernel
a
reasonably
source
of
randomness
is
the
output
of
a
cryptographic
hash
function
eg
when
fed
with
a
large
amount
of
moreorless
random
data
for
example
running
on
devmem
is
a
slow
but
random
enough
source
of
random
bits
there
are
bound
to
be
bits
of
entropy
in
the
tens
or
hundreds
of
megabytes
of
data
in
a
modern
workstations
memory
as
a
fair
amount
of
them
are
system
timers
io
buffers
etc
i
heard
about
this
solution
and
it
sounded
good
then
i
heard
that
folks
were
experiencing
times
of
seconds
to
run
this

im
not

in

the

probably
be

quite

if
the

on

as
i

it

impossible
to

once
it
hits

you
can
record
it
if
you
have
telco

the
telco
isnt
supposed
to
give
that

thats
the
rule
today
but
even
so
the

i

i

that

the

sheet

the
first
thing
it
doesnt
say
is
were
giving
you
stronger
encryption
what
it
says
is
the
u
s
government
has
developed
a
microcircuit
that
not
only
provides
privacy
through
encryption
that
is
substantially
more
robust
than
the
current
government
standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the
keys
needed
to
unlock
the
encryption
the
system
for
the
escrowing
of
keys
will
allow
the
government
to
gain
access
to
encrypted
information
only
with
appropriate
legal
authorization
but
des
is
strong
enough
that
only
the
government
can
break
it
now
so
the
major
effect
is
to
make
it
easier
for
government
to
break
at
best
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
nsa
to
break
since
they
need
to
get
one
of
the
two
escrowed
keys
to
do
a
bruteforce
search
for
the
other
key
similarly
it
didnt

were

is
commercially

because
encryption
is
already
commercially

the

may
not
be

and
phone
companies
could
offer
desbased
systems
now
if
they
were
convinced
the
government
would
let
them
and
they
could
make
enough
money
the
next
thing
it
didnt
say
is
were
making
encryption
legal
because
of
course
encryption
has
always
been
legal
and
the
president
cant
change
the
first
amendment
merely
by

what
it
did
say
was
in

this

i
do
not
intend
to
prevent
the
private

from
developing

the

from
approving

escrow

which
clearly
means
were

unless

business

into
this
another
thing
it
didnt
say
is
were
going
to
ask

for
money
to
do
lots
more
wiretapping
because
of
course
theres
a
budget
crisis
and
congress
might
debate

issues

not

what
it

interestingly
enough
in

we
may
want
to
use
some
rather
unusual
technology
such

sealed

destructive

rather
than
typical
computer
databases

is
fun

the
greatest
danger
of

if

be
the
chance

i

the

are
worse
than

theyll
just

this

pretty

an

by
the

to
do
exactly
what

theyre
doing
as

agrep

fuzzy

with

tremendous
number
of
powerful
search
options
the
one
most
obviously
applicable
to

key
selection
is
to
be
able
to
specify
the
similarity
of
matches
in
the
data
for

say
you
make
up
a
passwordphrase
of
of
course
you
rightly
suspect
that
this
key
itself
is
not
in
any
dictionary
or
word
list
but
how
close
is
it
to
en
entry
that
could
be
varied
by
some
crack
program
to
bruteforce
search
for
it
you
use
agrep
to
find
out
looking
with
argument
for
none
one
or
two
errors
no
matches
good
so
far
but
agrep
bigwordandphraselist
finds
that
the
pattern
is

close
to
the
pattern
imsel
part
of
himself
and
a
host
of
others
to
be

any
cryptographic
value

an
error
of
level
two
corresponds
to
a
simple
transposition
of

like
teh
for
the
a

acceptable
password
would
have
to
pass
as

level
in

use
my

sf
book
neuromancer
in

even
with

specification
as

all
those
people
who
think
the
title
was
necromancer
or

typos
why
miss
anything

the

can
look

in

wannabe
to
look
for
your
name
terrorists
names
special
tagalog
or
religious
words
etc
in
the
news
or

spool

you
can
even
search

by
using

random
threebyte
combinations
and
eliminate
all

that
dont

y
you

nsa
to
find
nsa
national

nsecag
no

nsa

you
can
also
specify
fixed
areas
looking

plate
when
you
know
that
the

are

you
might

agrep
licenseplatedatabase
will
find
all
plates
starting
with
xyz
with
up
to
two
errors
addition
substitution
deletion
in
the
number
area
you
can
also
weight
the
relative
cost
for
substiutions
additions
or
deletion
errors
for
example
when
searching
dna
patterns
for
a
particular
protein
combination
you
might
know
that
some
kinds
of
damage
cause
the
a
nucelotide
to
drop
out
more
than
other
errors
you
could
adjust
for
this
bias
by
setting
dc
where
you
set
the
deletion
cost
to
count
as
c
errors
a
steganographic
use
i
even
used
agrep
stegeograp
e
just
now
to
find
the
correct
spelling
would
be
to
intentionally
introduce
errors
of
a
certain
type
and
magnitude
into
a
plaintext
and
then
later
recover
the
orginal
it
via
an
agrep
pipe
lots
of
possibilities
here
when
only
outlaws
can
have
ciphertext
also
with
agreps
powerful
extraction
options
it
makes
it
easy
to
abstract
the
hits
into

form

splitting

a
random
number
and
then
with
its
complement
would
produce
two
subkeys
neither
of
which
is
useful
alone
that
variant
is
much
more
resistant
to
attack
clearly
one
can
get
even
more
sophisticated
to
protect
the
subkeys
even
more
other
thoughts
some
people
have
noted
the
size
and
complexity
of
the
databases
necessary
but
the
id
strings
the
phones
emit
could
be
their
back
door
key
doubleencrypted
with
the
escrow
repositories
public
keys
for
that
matter
they
could
do
that
only
with
session
keys
and
have
no
back
door
at
all
in
that
case
the
fbi
would
have
to
bring
every
intercept
to
the
repositories
to
be
decrypted
this
would
answer
many
of
the
objections
along
the
lines
of
how
do
you
make
sure
they
stop
we
can
even
combine
that
with
a
variant
of
the
digital
telephony
back
door
have
the
switch
do
the
tap
but
with
a
digitallysigned
record
of
the
time
phone
number
etc
of
the
call
that
provides
proof
to
the
escrow
agents
that
the
tap
was
done
in
compliance
with
the
terms
of
the
warrant
i
can
suggest
other
variations
too
suppose
each
clipper
chip
had
public
key
pairs
each
would
be
used
times
after
which
youd
need
more
keying
material
not
a
bad
idea
in
any
event
this
could
be
used
to
enforce
time
limits
or
rather
usage
limits
on
each
warrant
the
keys
the
repository
agents
would
deliver
wouldnt
last
for
very
long
i
suspect
that
the
cryptographic
algorithm
itself
is
secure
apart
from
the
obvious
why
push
a
weak
algorithm
when
youve
already
got
the
back
door
i
think
that
the
government
is
still
genuinely
concerned
about
foreign
espionage
especially
aimed
at
commercial
targets
this
scheme
lets
the
spooks
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too
ive
heard
rumors
over
the
years
that
some
factions
within
nsa
were
unhappy
with
des
because
it
was
too
good
not
that
they
couldnt
crack
it
but
it
was
much
too
expensive
to
do
so
as
easily
as
theyd
want
theyre
keeping
the
details
secret
so
that
others
dont
build
their
own
implementations
without
the
back
door
the
cryptographic
protocol
though
is
another
matter
i
see
no
valid
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
and
as
i
hope
ive
shown
above
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
do
things
that
arent
quite
as
bad
subject
how
does
it
really
work
was
re
text
of
white
house
announcement
and
qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
this
announcement
is
somewhat
disconcerting
it
doesnt
do
anything
evil
in
and
of
itself
but
bodes
badly
for
the
future
of
open
algorithms
and
standards
in
information
security
i
wont
start
panicking
untilunless
des
or
rsa
or
stuff
like
that
is
prohibited
but
im
a
little
anxious
no
doubt
it
wont
be
long
before
someone
posts
explaining
how
this
just
a
small
part
of
some
farranging
and
longlived
nsapkpirsfbiciahandguncontrolincclinton
conspiracy
to
subvert
freedom
democracy
and
mathematics
my
feeling
is
that
the
administration
probably
isnt
that
worried
about
things
like
des
and
rsa
and
pgp
and
ripem
since
theyll
never
be
used
by
a
group
much
wider
than
us
computer
geeks
the
fact
that
this
just
came
out
now
suggests
one
of
two
things
the
nsa
has
been
working
on
this
for
a
long
time
and
it
only
just
now
happened
to
be
ready
to
release
to
the
world
at
this
time
the
nsa
has
been
working
on
this
for
a
long
time
but
wasnt
able
to
get
the
bush
administration
to
go
along
with
this
plan
i
find
it
unlikely
that
this
would
have
been
because
of
a
sympathy
for
the
unescrowed
use
of
cryptography
more
likely
the
administration
felt
that
even
escrowed
secretalgorithm
and
for
all
we
know
trivially
breakable
cryptography
should
not
be
made
widely
available
thus
said

clipper

announcement
this
new

will
help
companies
protect
proprietary

protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone

and
prevent
unauthorized

of

at

this

preserves
the
ability
of

local

to

lawfully
the
phone

of

the
majority
of
the
discussion
involving
this
clipper
chip
seems
to
pertain
to
the
encryption
of
telephone
conversations
does
anyone
know
if
that
means
this
chip
is
designed
to
work
primarily
with
analog
signals
the
language
sort
of
suggests
this
but
its
hard
to
say
the
main
thing
i
just
dont
get
is
whether
this
chip
implements
symmetric
or
asymmetric
cryptographic
techniques
anybody
know
im
guessing
symmetric
but
they
dont
get
very
clear
about
it
if
it
is
symmetric
how
is
it
useful
for
anything
other
than
linklevel
encryption
with
an
identical
chip
at
each
end
how
can
you
negotiate
a
persession
key
using
symmetric
cryptography
without
using
a
trusted
third
party
who
knows
your
key
or
does
it
even
use
a
persession
key
if
its
asymmetric
what
about
pkps
patents
which
they
claim
cover
all
methods
of
doing
asymmetric
cryptography
are
they
getting
royalties
or
is
hiding
infringement
the
real
reason
for
keeping
the
algorithm
secret

they
would
have
to
take
both

out

run
them
against
my

and
draw
a
blank
i
was
thinking
about
this
also
its
quite
possible
the
system
transmits
in
clear
the
serial
number
of
the
device
being
used
that
way
they
can
start
a
tap
get
the
serial
number
and
use
the
warrant
for
the
first
tap
to
get
the
key
if
they
tap
someone
whos
apparently
using
encryption
but
dont
find
that
prefix
then
theyll
assume
its
an
unauthorized
encryption
scheme
from
the
limited
details
released
so
far
it
seems
that
the
clipper
chip
system
must
employ
some
sort
of
public
key
cryptography
otherwise
the
key
management
problems
inherent
to
symetric
ciphers
would
make
the
system
unworkable
it
probably
has
some
sort
of
public
key
exchange
that
takes
place
at
the
start
of
each
call
thats
how
they
would
identify
the
private
key
in
their
data
base
this
means
that
either
the
nsa
has
developed
some
non
rsa
public
key
algorythm
or
the
feds
have
decided
to
subsidize
pkp
rsadsi
the
former
is
rather
an
exciting
posibility
since
keeping
the
algorythm
secret
while
making
chip
implimentations
widely
avalibe
will
be
exceptionally
hard
if
the
feds
are
forced
to
make
it
avalible
in
order
to
gain
public
acceptance
than
that
could
break
rsas
stranglehold
on
public
key
crypto
in
the
us
as
for
my
impressions
of
the
whole
scheme
it
seems
that
instead
of
trying
to
ban
strong
crypto
they
are
trying
to
coopt
it
their
contention
that
they
need
to
keep
the
algorythm
secret
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
registration
suggests
possible
inherent
weakness
to
the
algorythm
more
likely
is
that
they
dont
want
anyone
constructing
black
market
devices
which
dont
have
the
keys
registered
anyone
else
notice
that
in
their
qa
session
they
talk
about
releasing
the
keys
only
to
people
with
proper
autiorization
but
carefully
dance
around
stating
that
the
keys
will
simply
have
to
be
supeonaed
they
seem
to
be
trying
to
keep
open
the
posibility
of
obtaining
keys
without
court
order
even
though
tapping
a

requires

also
pick
up

in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security

of

while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law

the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation

to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer

while
encryption
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as
policy
options
are
developed
the
administration
is
committed
to
working
with
the
private
sector
to
spur
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
which
will
use
new
telecommunications
and
computer
technologies
to
give
americans
unprecedented
access
to
information
this
infrastructure
of
highspeed
networks
information
superhighways
will
transmit
video
images
hdtv
programming
and
huge
data
files
as
easily
as
todays
telephone
system
transmits
voice
since
encryption
technology
will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop
consistent
comprehensive
policies
regarding
its
use
the
administration
is
committed
to
policies
that
protect
all
americans
right
to
privacy
while
also
protecting
them
from
those
who
break
the
law
further

technology
provides
law

with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
q
who
will
run
the
keyescrow
data
banks
a
the
two
keyescrow
data
banks
will
be
run
by
two
independent
entities
at
this
point
the
department
of
justice
and
the
administration
have
yet
to
determine
which
agencies
will
oversee
the
keyescrow
data
banks
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
q
whose
decision
was
it
to
propose
this
product
a
the
national
security
council
the
justice
department
the
commerce
department
and
other
key
agencies
were
involved
in
this
decision
this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the
chip
manufacturer
that
produces
them
q
who
provides
the
clipper
chip
a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their
facility
in
torrance
california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their

we

clinton
clipper
as
brad
templeton

others
have
noted
once
the

ensconced
in
enough
phones
there
will
be
enormous
pressure
to
make
it
the
legal
standard
and
it
will
become

as
well
there
is
a

of
confusion
in
the
proposal
about
whether
the
use
of

is
mandated
about
whether
nonescrow
alternatives
will
be
allowed
etc
there
are
also
unclear
issues
about
how
hard
or
how
illegal
it
will
be
to
make
workalikes
which
meet

which

sure
the

will
see
these

thrashed

in

meanwhile
id
be
interested
to
hear
rsa

reaction
often
criticized
in
this
group
for
their
licensing
policies
the
usual
complaints
about
mailsafe
costing
too
much
at
or
so
and
the
general
issue
of
software
patents
we
may
find
that
allying
ourselves
with
rsa
is
the
best
thing
we
can
do
whats
a
mere
licensing
fee
when
our
liberty
may
be
at

if
everyone
who

paid

for

expire

sothen
rsa
would
make

im

a
small

to
pay
for
those
to
whom
sounds
like
too
much
im
sure
the
actual
terms
could
be
different
spread
out
over
several
years
whatever
to
me
its
a
small
price
to
pay
strong
crypto
means
strong
privacy
escrowing
keys
sending
copies
of
keys
to
large
databases
and
splitting
keys
into
two
pieces
all
done
with
secret
and
nonanalyzable
protocols
and
algorithms
is
not
strong
crypto
whatever
some
of
us
may
think
about
the
abstract
principles
of
patenting
number
theory
applications
this
minor
issue
pales
in
comparison
with
the
potential
dangers
of
the
clipper
proposal
note
that
i
said
potentialwell
presumably
learn
more
in
the
coming

the
rsa

public
have
been
analyzed

attacked

years
and
source

is
available
to
better
ensure
no
deliberate
weakenesses

i
know
of
a

of
groups
putting

encryption
systems

offtheshelf
hardware
like
soundblaster
boards
for
the

celptype

the

generations
of
pcs
using
fast
and
pentiums
are
fast
enough
to
do
realtime
voice
encryption
combined
with
diffiehellman
key
exchange
this
should
provide
an
alternative
to
the
clipper
system
of
course
we
dont
really
know
if
the
administration
proposes
to
outlaw
competing
systems
it
seems
to
me
that
their
goal
of
tapping
terrorists
child
pornographers
and
hilary
bashers
would
be
thwarted
if
lowcost
alternatives
to
clipper
proliferated
not
to
defend
child
pornographers

terrorists
but
limiting
basic
freedoms
to
catch
a
few

is
not
the
american

i

i
wish
i
could
agree
with
you
ask
yourself
this
why
would
any
private
sector
entity
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
was
known
to
be
at
least
partially
compromised
key
escrows
in
this
instance
why
would
any
private
sector
entity
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
had
not
been
properly
evaluated
ie
algorythm
not
publically
released
the
answer
seems
obvious
to
me
they
wouldnt
there
is
other
hardware
out
there
not
compromised
des
as
an
example
triple
des
as
a
better
one
my
suspicion
is
that
the
prices
will
drop
dramatically
on
these
non
clipper
systems
if
not
were
in
trouble
given
that
the
clinton
administration
is
not
entirely
stupid
although
wed
like
to
think
so
i
cannot
believe
that
they
have
failed
to
realize
this
they
know
their
initiative
will
fail
much
as
crippled
des
was
never
taken
seriously
the
only
way
their
moves
can
work
is
by
coercion
you
know
little
about
politics
if
you
dont
realize
that
this
is
just
a
first
step
in
the
next
move
it
makes
no
sense
otherwise
the
next
move
banning
or
severly
crippling
crypto
not
using
the
clipper
system
is
easily
justified
why
would
anyone
want
other
encryption
unless
they
were
trying
to
subvert
the
government
weve
provided
you
with
a
very
secure
alternative
so
use
it
or
go
to
jailbe
finedwhatever
how
can
you
reconcile
the
administrations
self
proclaimed
purpose
of
providing
law
enforcement
with
access
to
encrypted
data
without
making
the
clipper
system
the
only
crypto
available
in
the
us
you
simply
cant
and
the
administration
knows
it
anyone
who
wanted
to
keep
the
govt
out
of
their
hair
be
it
for
drug
dealing
or
whatever
would
just
buy
still
available
nonclipper
systems
dont
sell
our
crafty
clinton
types
short
they
cant
be
that
stupid
either
banning
non
clipper
crypto
is
the
next
answer
or
the
administrations
collective
iq
is
about
that
of
a
potato
why
do
you
think
att
jumped
on
so
fast
they
know
its
going
to
be
big
and
not
because
its
better
right
on
the
face
of
it
noone
will
buy
the
stuff
that
doesnt
have
to

must

this

why
the

isnt
this
just
a
little
melodramatic
i
really
wonder

sir
andor
madam
i
must
object
most
strongly
to
the
administrations
evolving
position
on
encryption
and
cryptography
i
am
shocked
at
the
clinton
regimes
increasing
lean
towards
a
authoritarian
approach
with
regard
to
privacy
and
freedom
from
government
oversight
in
day
to
day
life
it
is
apparent
to
me
that
those
who
drafted
the
clipper
chip
proposal
which
is
incidentally
gaining
notoriety
as
the
big
brother
proposal
are
either
incredibly
ignorant
or
very
sly
indeed
anyone
knowledgeable
in
the
nuances
of
cryptographic
development
and
research
must
understand
that
a
key
step
in
the
development
of
a
new
algorithm
especially
one
destined
for
standardization
is
the
full
disclosure
of
the
algorithm
to
the
private
and
academic
sectors
the
proper
evaluation
of
an
algorithm
dep
ends
on
careful
scrutiny
by
these
sectors
and
only
such
scrutiny
can
provide
true
public
confidence
in
the
security
of
the
algorithm
the
assumption
that
a
new
algorithm
will
be
accepted
based
on
assurances
from
experts
without
full
disclosure
is
plain
ignorance
in
addition
the
assumption
that
an
algorithm
will
be
marketable
over
other
technology
such
as
des
when
it
is
characterized
by
key
escrow
is
lunacy
it
seems
an
easy
step
in
the
logic
chain
that
probable
consumers
will
prefer
to
purchase
equipment
not
crippled
by
government
key
escrow
no
matter
how
tamper
proof
the
key
escrows
might
be
i
cannot
believe
that
even
the
least
educated
policy
maker
would
have
failed
to
realize
these
flaws
i
can
only
assume
then
that
the
drafters
of
the
clipper
chip
proposal
knew
very
well
the
difficulties
of
selling
a
crippled
system
to
the
private
sector
the
only
way
this
proposal
makes
any
sense
or
has
any
chance
of
succeeding
is
in
coercion
even
the
language
of
the
proposal
makes
it
painfully
clear
that
the
next
logical
step
is
the
outlawing
of
other
encryption
devices
and
hardware
that
do
not
uti
lize
the
big
brother
chip
unfortunately
the
public
at
large
is
not
educated
enough
on
the
issue
to
realize
what
they
are
losing
i
expect
the
big
brother
proposal
to
encounter
little
resistance
from
the
american
people
who
you
will
have
so
efficiently
duped
once
again
with
pretty
words
like
harmony
right
to
encryption
and
voluntary
it
mortifies
me
that
the
phrase
that
seems
to
be
used
more
and
more
often
to
characterize
the
clinton

is
i
cant
believe
its

probably

they

try

by
transmitting
in

marc

mvanheyncsindianaedu
writes
the
main
thing
i
just
dont
get
is
whether
this
chip
implements
symmetric
or
asymmetric
cryptographic
techniques
anybody
know
i
dont
know
but
im
as
willing
to
speculate
as
anyone
several
people
have
suggested
that
the
chips
use
publickey
cryptography
another
possibility
is
to
use
diffiehellman
key
exchange
or
some
other
algorithm
which
has
a
similar
effect
dh
allows
both
ends
to
agree
on
a
session
key
which
they
use
with
symmetric
cryptography
something
like
des
for
the
encryption
how
could
the
back
door
keys
work
in
this
system
i
can
see
a
few
possibilities
one
is
that
the
dhlike
algorithm
has
the
property
that
the
session
key
can
be
deduced
by
an
eavesdropper
who
knows
the
back
door
keys
for
one
or
possibly
both
communicants
perhaps
the
random
numbers
used
in
the
dh
are
seeded
by
the
back
door
key
or
some
such
another
possibility
as
was
suggested
here
earlier
is
that
the
chips
simply
broadcast
the
session
key
encrypted
with
the
chips
own
internal
secret
key
in
this
system
the
back
door
keys
are
secret
keys
usable
for
decrypting
this
session
key
broadcast
actually
the
chips
secret
key
doesnt
need
to
be
a
public
key
in
this
usage
but
can
be
identical
to
the
secret
backdoor
key
this
proposal
seems
most
straightforward
to
me
still
another
possibility
is
that
the
encryption
algorithm
used
for
the
message
itself
has
a
dual
key
property
that
possession
of
either
of
two
keys
can
be
used
to
decrypt
it
one
key
would
be
the
session
key
from
the
dh
exchange
and
the
other
would
be
the
back
door
key
for
the
chip
its
worth
noting
that
one
of
the
proposals
dorothy
denning
raised
during
her
amazingly
prescient
online
discussion
last
november
and
december
was
a
variation
on
diffiehellman
in
which
a
third
party
would
participate
in
deriving
the
session
keys
this
doesnt
quite
fit
into
what
we
know
of
how
clipper
works
but
it
hints
that
those
who
had
early
knowledge
of
clipper
or
whose
thinking
was
somehow
synchronized
with
clipper
designers
may
have
had
diffiehellman
on
their
minds

kept

this

it

that

my
first
thought
was
that
theyre
using
diffiehellman
exponential

or
an
equivalent
however
the
diffiehellman

claims
all
equivalents

the

point
stands

the
greatest
danger
of
the
escrow
database
if
it
were
kept
on
disk
would
be
the
chance
that
a
complete
copy
could
somehow
leak
out
you
of
course
then
its
hard
to
backup
however
i
think
the
consequences
of
no
backup
the
data
is
not
there
when
a
warrant
comes
are
worse
than
the
consequences
of
a
secret
backup
if
the
data
isnt
there
when
the
warrant
comes
you
effectively
have
secure
crypto
if
secret
backups
are
keptthen
you
effectively
have
no
crypto
thus
this
poster
is
essentialy
arguing
no
crypto
is
better
than
secure
crypto
if
the
data
isnt
there
when
the
warrant
comes
then
the
government
will
just
have
to
use
normal
law
enforcement
techniques
to
catch
crooks
is
this
so
bad
btw
bugging
isnt
yet
a
normal
law
enforcement
technique
with
the
privacy
clipper
it
will
become
a
normal
technique

i
probably
shouldnt

they
could
try
to
detect
the
use
of
an

cypher
by
transmitting
in
the
clear
some
statistical
properties
of
the
plaintext
an
oldfashioned
wiretap
could
then
detect
the
use
of
preencryption
which
would
drastically
increase
the
measured
entropy
of
the
input
a
countermeasure
to
this
would
be
to
use
steganographic
techniques
which
put

this
way

can
do

so
no

please
it
comes
out
of
a
background
of
years
as
a
senior
corporate
staff
executive
in
two
fortune
companies
id
be
happy
to
use
a
crypto
system
supplied
by
the
nsa
for
business
if
they
told
me
it
was
more
secure
than
des
and
in
particular
resistant
to
attempts
by
japanese
french
and
other
competitive
companies
and
governments
to
break
id
be
happy
to
do
so
even
with
escrowed
keys
provided
i
was
happy
about
the
bona
fides
of
the
escrow
agencies
the
federal
reserve
would
certainly
satisfy
me
as
would
something
set
up
by
one
of
the
big
accounting
firms
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
president
if
they
stated
there
were
no
trap
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committee
of
independent
experts
examined
the
thing
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
reported
back
that
it
was
secure
id
trust
something
from

nsa
long
before
id
trust
something
from
some
swiss

this
may
seem
surprising
to
some
here
but
i
suggest
most

would
feel
the
same
way
mostmanysome

corporations
have

expect

to

as

we
have

like

would
the

a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad

review
bs
about
the
wonderfulness
of
the
key
escrow
system
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
theyll
just
provide
an
easilycompromised
version
to
jq
public
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
maybe
we
need

amendment
there
is

created
in
the
assessment
that
this

is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be

in

are
harmoniously
balanced

such

the

the

this
is
the

that

about

simply
connect

they

just
like

but
unlike

they
now
need
to
a
get

the

will
the

arrest
you
for

a

license
theres
also
bureacracy
and
security
problems
within
each
escrow

how
will
requests
for
key
disclosure
be
authenticated
put
in
enough
safeguards
of
the
kind
bureaucrats
and

feel
comfortable
with
and
it
might
take
a
long
time
to
get
that
key
even
when
a

is
approved
how
is
the

going

will
it

of

of
the

theres
going

be
a

of
weak

how
many
of
these
kinds
of
problems
will
be
open
for
public

scrutiny
furthermore
the
feds
might
be
leery
of
handing

around
even
to

a

this
would
be
an
especially
acute
issue
if
some
other

police
had
mishandled
a

resulting
in
lawsuits
financial
settlements
and
political
embarassment
so
the
feds
implement
it
this
way
b
some
federal

gets
the

performs
the

and

the

i
understand
the

i
could
be
wrong
but
ive
seen
no
mention
of
session
keys
being
the
escrowed
entities
true
in
theory
in
practice
the
technology
of
cellular

will
probably
be
spread
spectrum
and
quite
difficult
to
record
the
crypttext
without
the
key
if
the
frequency
path
depends
on
they
key
as
i
understand
it
to
it
could
be
made
effectively
impossible
to
record
i
am
not
an
expert
in
the
cryptography
science
but
some
basic
things
seem
evident
to
me
things
which
this
clinton
clipper
do
not
address
the
all
pertain
to
opportunites
for
abuse
and
conclusions
based
on
what
i
have
seen
the
membership
of
this
group
except
for
two
notable
persons
agree
to
if
anything
bad
is
possible
by
the
government
in
theory
it
almost
always
ends
up
happening
in
fact
so
the
key
is
to
make
abuse
impossible
question
authority
and
remember
power
does
corrupt
i
think
one
has
to
regard
this
whole
idea
in
the
sense
that
it
will
be
expanded
to
include
other
data
forms
such
as
data
transfer
and
stored
data
and
as
such
should
be
treated
as
if
it
were
expanded
or
such
expansion
will
be
almost
impossible
to
stop
using
clipper
as
a
precident
there
was
a
hint
of
that
in
the
proposal
remember
that
said
please
bear
with
me
i
am
not
very
articulate
so
i
take
more
words
to
say
what
others
could
say
much
more
briefly
thank
you
once
it
hits
land
you
can
record
it
if
you
have
telco
access
the
telco
isnt
supposed
to
give
that
without
a
warrant
thats
the
rule
today
as
i
suggested
this
is
now
the
hint
is
in
the
proposal
that
this
or
similar
proposals
are
being
considered
for
other
forms
of
encryptions
such
as
data
transfer
data
files
and
such
largely
dependent
on
how
this
thing
is
accepted
or
flies
i
think
one
would
be
wise
to
treat
this
in
the
manner
one
would
when
not
if
it
gets
expanded
to
other
areas
than
cellular
phones
i
think
this
is
guaranteed
to
happen
if
this
proposal
gets
by
salami
politics
it
has
been
and
is
used
in
several
other
areas
it
is
certain
to
be
used
here
government
is
not
going
to
easily
give
up
on
the
idea
that
they
should
be
able
to
eavesedrop
whenever
they
want
to
court
order
required
has
proven
to
be
a
rather
flimsy
guarantee
if
the
case
warrants
they
can
always
sieze
the
material
and
force
one
to
give
the
key
or
sit
in
jail
forever
on
periodically
renewed
contempt
charges
so
it
is
not
denying
the
justice
system
the
information
nor
the
ability
to
lock
someone
up
if
guilty
or
refuses
to
divulge
the
means
to
access
the
info
this
is
not
protected
under
the
fifth
one
can
be
forced
to
perform
acts
that
would
result
in
divulging
incriminating
evidence
so
blocking
restrictions
on
private
encryption
is
not
preventing
legitimate
law
enforcement
it
does
make
illegitimate
law
enforcement
a
bunch
more
difficult
especially
fishing
expeditions
without
the
targets
knowlege
dont
give
up
the
right
to
be
safe
from
that
that
should
be
nonnegotiable
and
clinton
and
co
know
it
which
is
probably
why
they
quietly
developed
this
thing
figuring
if
they
get
it
this
far
they
can
ram
it
on
through
how
come
those
consulted
could
be
roughly
described
as
us
insiders
they
cannot
quietely
impliment
it
though
when
they
ban
other
schemes
to
ensure
its
exclusive
use
hence
the
nice
pr
document
to
try
and
reassure
everyone
dont
buy
into
it
has
government
really
earned
that
kind
of
trust
past
or
future
to
be
secure
and
free
one
must
keep
government
honest
and
the
only
way
to
do
that
is
to
make
abuse
impossible
not
unlikely
or
difficult
but
even
so
the
evidence
would
not
be
admissible
i
think
unless
the
judge
so
ordered
i
think
that
even
interception
of
the
crypttext
without
a
warrant
would
be
illegal
cops
cant
record
todays
plain
cellular
calls
and
then
ask
a
judge
hey
can
we
have
permission
to
listen
to
those
tapes
can
they
so
what
one
could
use
information
gained
by
reuse
of
the
keys
saved
after
the
last
case
was
finished
or
other
means
master
key
backdoor
easily
broken
algorithm
to
find
other
evidence
which
given
to
a
judge
would
authorize
a
tap
which
wouldnt
have
been
possible
otherwise
this
has
been
the
more
common
manner
of
abuse
of
wiretaps
in
the
past
for
local
cops
this
might
be
workable
to
keep
them
honest
but
the
feds
have
a
workaround
somehow
bet
on
it
does
anyone
really
believe
for
example
that
the
government
will
use
a
scheme
nsa
cannot
listen
in
on
scanning
for
keywords
either
easily
defeated
in
realtime
or
via
a
master
key
i
sure
dont
this
whole
thing
sounds
like
something
to
eliminate
the
need
to
use
oldfashioned
police
work
to
build
a
case
in
the
past
eavesdropping
was
rather
easy
with
or
without
a
court
order
i
think
the
law
enforcement
community
has
become
a
bit
spoiled
and
will
resist
changes
that
require
them
to
revert
to
using
oldfashioned
detective
work
i
just
find
it
somewhat
surprising
coming
from
a
bunch
that
cares
so
much
about
civil
and
individual
rights
that
puts
people
first
the
question
is
put
people
first
to
where
with
the
innards
not
being
revealed
how
is
one
to
be
sure
there
doesnt
exist
a
master
key
for
use
by
nsa
etc
so
they
can
do
their
keyword
scan
etc
on
conversations
they
routinely
monitor
without
a
specific
court
order
remember
the
cellular
phone
limitiation
is
only
temporary
bet
on
it
and
so
far
i
have
not
heard
about
police
telling
people
that
they
have
been
tapped
and
nothing
incriminating
was
found
what
is
to
keep
them
from
simply
keeping
the
keys
on
file
for
next
time
after
awhile
they
would
have
quite
a
collection
kept
especially
for
folks
they
deem
disruptive
and
if
they
get
only
one
key
that
would
reduce
the
search
space
a
lot
unless
it
is
an
rsa
scheme
remember
nixon
years
need
for
court
orders
really
slowed
them
down
didnt
it
and
unless
the
escrow
accounts
are
not
government
controlled
fat
chance
i
see
one
ending
up
being
under
say
treasury
the
other
under
justice
it
could
be
worth
some
serious
bucks
to
some
folks
to
get
keys
to
a
competitors
clinton

descendent

this

is
expanded

encryption
enough
bucks
would
get
one
the
keys
or
the
innards
for
this
algorithm
perhaps
not
an
important
concern
but
given
past
government
behavior
and
the
other
problems
worse
of
course
if
the
government
then
uses
this
clinton
clipper
to
argue
for
restrictions
on
unapproved
encryption
this
is
the
main
concern
of
most
of
us
i
think
the
camels
nose
in
the
tent
etc
yes
that
is
a
major
concern
but
i
think
that
they
think
they
can
win
just
by
having
of
the
usa
use
this
system
they
dont
even
have
to
care
about
the
cautious
thats
left
they
dont
catch
the
really
smart
crooks
anyway
john

about

thats
why
hes
in

now
hard
to
believe
but
true
what
will
one
do
when
it
is
expanded
to
data
storage
encryption
you
can
bet
that
if
clipper
is
accepted
that
will
be
next
on
the
agenda
it
is
even
hinted
at
in
the
proposal
read
it
carefully
expect
the
argumet
well
if
you
got
nothing
to
hide
fine
then
using
that
argument
one
should
not
object
to
video
cameras
being
installed
in
every
room
of
ones
home
granted
an
exteme
expansion
of
the
idea
but
the
principle
holds
private
stuff
should
remain
private
even
from
a
govt
fishing
expedition
and
lawsrules
may
change
in
the
future
as
to
safeguards
when
it
comes
to
the
fed
government
safeguards
are
pretty
meaningless
if
they
want
to
doget
something
dont
work
so
hard
to
give
up
some
rather
treasured
rights
or
establish
bad
precidents
please
the
price
could
be
hell
to
pay
later
this
scheme
can
succeed
without
laws
forbidding
more
which
people
would
fight
a
lot
harder
they
like
this
enough
that
they
are
dropping
the
so
called
digital
telephony
proposal
according
to
rumours
however
the
meaning
of
that
is
complex
since
they
still
want
to
get
at
the
crypttext
on
telco
systems
and
that
requires
a
bit
of
work
people
would
fight
laws
forbidding
more
now
but
in
say
two
years
because
we
have
this
crisis
situation
which
must
be
addressed
by
some
drastic
action
just
this
added
reasonable
restriction
will
only
bother
those
who
have
someting
to
hide
etc
please
dont
buy
into
it
if
the
clinton
clipper
is
so
very
good
why
not
make
its
algrithm
public
so
many
people
can
exchange
ideas
and
examine
it
rather
than
a
few
isolated
respected
experts
respected
by
whom
for
what
perhaps
a
certain
professor
who
likes
key
banks
would
be
one
of
the
selected
experts
this
does
seem
to
expand
on
some
ideas
the
person
was
advocating
if
i
recall
how
would
anybody
know
that
what
the
experts
examine
is
the
same
as
what
will
end
up
being
used
in
the
clipper
chip
if
it
is
kept
secret
perhaps
the
clipper
will
use
a
crippled
version
with
a
master
key
provision
or
features
not
present
in
the
version
subjected
for
study
and
evaluation
by
the
experts
and
who
chooses
the
expertes
the
government
no
conflict
of
interest
there
and
isnt
it
a
requirement
for
any
decent
encryption
scheme
that
it
not
have
its
effectiveness
reduced
by
having
the
algrorithm
widely
known
i
was
lead
to
believe
that
one
should
assume
the
other
side
has
everything
you
have
except
for
the
keys
i
recall
ideas
presented
to
this
group
are
rejected
if
a
requirement
exists
the
algorithm
be
secret
another
question
since
it
is
a
safe
bet
this
clipper
thing
would
not
be
used
for
government
security
they
are
regarding
it
as
not
real
secure
but
good
enough
for
common
folk
i
think
i
would
like
to
see
a
full
description
not
a
pr
nonstatement
of
just
what
good
enough
means
i
think
when
saying
how
strong
it
is
good
enough
really
means
not
very
the
excuse
that
other
countries
have
these
restrictions
is
not
acceptable
other
countries
do
not
have
our
bill
of
rights
and
constitution
which
the
people
not
the
governments
of
those
other
countries
often
regard
with
envy
what
we
have
as
rights
they
have
as
revokable
privileges
and
if
we
expect
to
retain
those
rights
and
protections
we
must
not
allow
them
to
be
gutted
because
we
just
gotta
have
this
thing
to
fight
crime
we
have
allready
have
our
bill
of
rights
pretty
much
torn
to
shreds
we
should
not
permit
more
weakining
for
yet
another
noble
cause
instead
we
should
be
trying
to
repair
the
damage
our
crime
problem
may
have
a
number
of
causes
but
too
many
rights
and
safeguards
is
not
a
signifigant
one
a
broken
court
system
and
poor
police
work
are
a
much
more
signifigant
cause
as
having
too
many
rights
disregarding
addressing
the
root
causes
for
crime
etc
btw
those
who
suggest
that
this
is
just
an
attack
on
clinton
believe
this
i
would
be
going
ballistic
reagardless
who
seriously
proposed
this
thing
it
is
just
another
step
in
a
gradual
erosion
of
our
rights
under
the
constitution
or
bill
of
rights
the
last
couple
of
decades
have
been
a
nonstop
series

of

it
has
to

your

i
am

most

their

will
not

why

they
face
every

the

dumps

there
are

when
i
worked
in

there
was
a

at

local
radio

and
the
alarm
company
heard
the
cops
responding
to
the
call
over
the
audio
pickup
in
the
store
what
this
effectively
means
is
that
if
they
perform
a
wiretap
on
you
at
the
end
of
the
wiretap
they
should
be
obligated
to
inform
you
that
a

was
performed

replace
for

the

that
it

a

it

step
if

set

i

at

of

they
should

if
we

i

completely
against
anything

it

spent

though
some
may
argue
about
the
nose
of

its
worth
noting
that
the
government

is
limited
to
scrambled
telephony
if
it
is
only
used
for
that
purpose
and
does
not
extend
to
electronic

or

encryption
then
it
is
an
improvement
over
the
current
massproduced
standard

technology
which
with
a
few
exceptions
is
limited

note
that
the
big
issue
for
the

is
the
continued
ability
to
wiretap
before
we
go
off
the
deep
end
with
long
discusions
about
secure
crypto
for
email
and

lets
focus
on
this
one
question
that
was
not
asked
in
the
release
is
whether
this
proposal
is
limited
to
telephony
or
if
the
government
intends
to
expand
it
though
i
share
many
of
the
concerns
expressed
by
some
i
find
the
proposal
less
threatening
than
many
others
since
right
now
most
americans
have
no
secure
telephony
and
any
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
leads
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
this
would
also
plug
up
the
security
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phones
reading
between
the
lines
i
infer
that
the
system
is
highly
secure
without
access
to
the
keys
this
would
meet
the
needs
of
us
businesses
confronted
by
rich
and
powerful
adversaries
including
french
and
japanese
security
services
and
rich
japanese
companies
it
allows
the
nsa
to
make
available
some
of
its
better
stuff
while
protecting
law
enforcement
needs
most
legitimate
us
corporations
trust
the
nsa
and
would
be
delighted
to
have
a
highsecurity
system
certified
by
them
even
at
the
price
of
depositing
keys
in
escrow
i
see
no
difficulty
in
creating
a
reliable
escrow
corporations
entrust
their
secrets
to
attorneys
every
day
of
the
week
and
that
system
has
worked
pretty
well
from
my
point
of
view
this
is
a
fair
starting
point
there
are
concerns
that
need
to
be
addressed
including
the
reliability
of
the
escrows
but
in
return
we
get
access
to
highsecurity
crypto
many
have
suggested
that
des
and
other
systems
may
be
breakable
by
the
nsa
and
hence
others
similarly
skilled
and
endowed
there
is
at
least
a
good
possibility
which
should
be
checked
that
the
proposed
system
is
not
so
breakable
it
doesnt
have
to
be
nor
does
it
have
to
have
trapdoors
if
the
government
can
get
the
keys
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
court
order
thus
they
can
protect
legitimate
communications
against
economic
adversaries

still
being
able

eavesdrop

net
have
asked
for
more
technical
details
and
some
have
been
laboring
under
understandable
misunderstandings
given
the
lack
of
details
in
the
news
articles
so
here
to
help
out
is
your
friendly
nsa
link
me
i
was
somewhat
surprised
friday
to
get
a
call
from
the
agency
which
supplied
many
of
the
missing
details
i
was
told
the
info
was
public
so
here
it
is
the
cc
of
this
to
dennis
branstad
at
nist
is
mostly
as
a
double
check
on
my
facts
since
i
assume
he
is
aware
of
all
this
please
let
me
know
if
i
have
anything
wrong
the
clipper
chip
will
have
a
secret
crypto
algorithm
embedded
in
silicon
each
chip
will
have
two
secret
keys
one
will
be
the
same
for
all
chips
ie
a
systemwide
key
and
the
other
will
be
unit
specific
i
dont
know
what
nist
and
nsa
will
call
them
but
i
will
call
them
the
system
key
sk
and
unit
key
uk
in
this
message
the
ic
will
be
designed
to
be
extremely
difficult
to
reverse
so
that
the
system
key
can
be
kept
secret
aside
it
is
clear
that
they
also
want
to
keep
the
algorithm
secret
and
in
my
opinion
it
may
be
as
much
for
that
as
this
stated
purpose
the
unit
key
will
be
generated
as
the
xor
of
two
random
numbers
and
which
will
be
kept
by
the
two
escrow
authorities
who
these
escrow
authorities
will
be
is
still
to
be
decided
by
the
attorney
general
but
it
was
stressed
to
me
that
they
will
not
be
nsa
or
law
enforcement
agencies
that
they
must
be
parties
acceptable
to
the
users
of
the
system
as
unbiased
when
a
law
enforcement
agency
gets
a
court
order
they
will
present
it
to
these
two
escrow
authorities
and
receive
and
thereby
allowing
access
to
the
unit
key
uk
in
addition
to
the
system
key
each
user
will
get
to
choose
his
or
her
own
key
and
change
it
as
often
as
desired
call
this
key
plain
old
k
when
a
message
is
to
be
sent
it
will
first
be
encrypted
under
k
then
k
will
be
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
uk
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
added
to
produce
a
three
part
message
which
will
then
be
encrypted
under
the
system
key
sk
producing
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
when
a
court
order
obtains
and
and
thence
k
the
law
enforcement
agency
will
use
sk
to
decrypt
all
information
flowing
on
the
suspected
link
aside
it
is
my
guess
that
they
may
do
this
constantly
on
all
links
with
or
without
a
court
order
since
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
which
links
over
which
a
message
will
flow
this
gives
the
agency
access
to
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
in
the
above
message
they
then
check
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
and
see
if
it
is
on
the
watch
list
for
which
they
have
a
court
order
if
so
they
will
decrypt
ek
uk
to
obtain
k
and
then
decrypt
em
k
to
obtain
m
i
am
still
in
the
process
of
assessing
this
scheme
so
please
do
not
take
the
above
as
any
kind
of
endorsement
of
the
proposed
scheme
all
i
am
trying
to
do
is
help
all
of
us
assess
the
scheme
more
knowledgably
but
i
will
say
that
the
need
for
just
one
court
order
worries
me
i
would
feel
more
comfortable
though
not
necessarily
comfortable
if
two
separate
court
orders
were
needed
one
per
escrow
authority
while
no
explanation
is
needed
the
following
story
adds
some
color
in
researching
some
ideas
that
silvio
micali
and
i
have
been
kicking
around
i
spoke
with
gerald
gunther
the
constitutional
law
expert
here
at
stanford
and
he
related
the
following
story
when
edward
levi
became
pres
fords
attorney
general
right
after
watergate
he
was
visited
by
an
fbi
agent
asking
for
the
wiretap
authorizations
when
levy
asked
for
the
details
so
he
could
review
the
cases
as
required
by
law
the
agent
told
him
that
his
predecessors
just
turned
over
blank
signed
forms
every
time
levi
did
not
comply
and
changed
the
system
but
the
lesson
is
clear
no
single
person
or
authority
should
have
the
power
to
authorize
wiretaps
or
worse
yet
divulging
of
personal
keys

he

the

the

this
is
not
a
major
difference
but
i
thought
it
should
be
mentioned

thank
her
for
bringing
it

you

they

a

are

working

to
turn

right
now
and
they
are
all
working
in

mode
and
yes
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto

lifted
but
this
is
at

an
incrememental
improvement
for
certain
applications
there
are
no

you

the

isnt

out
repeatedly
if
you
produce
the
infrastructure
that
would
permit
a
police
state
to
function
all
that
is
required
to
suddenly
find
yourself
living
in
one
is
a
change
of
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
government
our
constitution
was
built
by
men
who
had
to
risk
their
lives
to
ensure
freedom
in
our
country
they
designed
the
system
to
make
it
difficult
for
tyranny
to
arise
for
instance
one
of
the
reasons
the
fourth
amendment
was
put
there
was
to
make
it
harder
for
the
government
to
try
to
make
smuggling
a
crime
think
i
jest
john
hancock
made
all
his
money
smuggling
rum
which
is
after
all
a
drug
think
about
it
the
government
has
everyones
keys
in
escrow
and
the
fbi
gets
their
pet
wiretap
without
leaving
the
office
scheme
there
is
a
coup
which
happens
every
day
all
around
the
world
within
hours
everyone
in
the
country
who
might
oppose
the
tyrants
is
being
monitored
more
closely
than
ever
before
possible
without
the
tools
being
in
place
a
tyranny
cannot
stand
with
tools
like
this
in
place
a
tyrannical
dictatorship
could
actually
be
successfully
imposed
why
give
the
government
tools
with
which
to
enslave
you
maybe
you
can
trust
bill
clinton
but
are
you
willing
to
tell
me
that
you
can
trust
every
government
that
will
ever
arise
in
the
us
hereafter
i
am
not
willing
to
make
that
leap
of
faith
tim
may
whose
sig
block
may
get
him
busted
in
the
new

isnt
this
just
a
little
melodramatic
im
a
political
dissident
as
such
i
am
acutely
aware
of
what
happens
to
political
dissidents
in
most
of
the
world
in
most
of
the
world
i
could
be
killed
for
my
beliefs
call
amnesty
international
some
time
to
find
out
what
happens
to
dissidents
in
most
of
the
world
all
that
seperates
the
us
from
most
of
those
places
is
a
thin
piece
of
parchment
in
the
national
archives
thats
being
constantly
more
and
more
eroded
by
such
farces
as
the
war
on
drugs
coups
have
happened
in
countries
that
have
had
stable
democracies
for
over
a
hundred
years
governments
throughout
history
have
fallen
no
government
has
lasted
for
more
than
a
few
hundred
years
often
they
are
replaced
by
dictatorships
do
you
really
believe
so
intensely
that
it
could
never
ever
ever
happen
here
that
you
are
willing
to
bet
your
own
life
and
the
lives
of
your
children
and
other
loved
ones
on
it
if
we
construct
the
tools
with
which
tyranny
could
be
enforced
we
make
it
orders
of
magnitude
more
likely
that
it
could
happen
because
if
it
happened
with
the
tools
already
in
place
it
could
actually
stick
naive
fools
such
as
our
leadership
believe
they
can
protect
us
where
hundreds
that
have
gone
before
have
failed
thriving
democracies
led
by
men
far
more
skillfull
than
bill
clinton
have
fallen
to
dictatorship
rome
had
a
thriving

run
by
exquisitely
skilled
men
before
they
became
a

i
for
one
am
unwilling
to
trust
that
it

here
only
hubris
would
allow
us
to
believe
we
are

oh

its

all
this

truth
is
even
granted
lots
of
covert
power
on
the
part
of
the

branch
this
system
is
more
difficult
to
tap
with
than

the
fact
that
it
is
easier
to
tap
than
some
hypothetical
system
neither
you
nor
i
am
going
to
place
on

is
neither
here
nor
there
the
only
rational
concerns
i
am
seeing
raised
are
a
is
the
key
really
just
chopped
in
half
and
not
some
xor
arrangement
that
is
has
some
egregious
technical
error
been
built
in
to
the
plan
b
is
this
is
the
first
step
toward
strict
regulation
of
strong
encryption
but
thats
not
really
the
issue
the
real
issue
is
whether
this
will
be
used
to
justify
a
ban
against
individuals
use
of
private
ie
anything
else
encryption
methods
this
is
b
of
course
i
suspect
not
if
the

actually
wanted
to
make
such
regs
theyd
just
do
it
a

a
remark
i
heard
the
other

is
beginning
to
take
on
increasingly
frightening
significance
the
comment
was
made
that
in
other
parts
of
the
world
the
democrats
note
the
big
d
would
be
known
as
socialists
we
might
get
further
if
we
begin
by
accepting
that
the
government
really
couldnt
be
bothered
less
about
the
political
opinions
of
the
right
wing
pro
establishment
types
just
about
the
only
circumstances
in
which
i
could
think
that
they
would
be
interested
in
their
political
views
would
be
to
recruit
them
as
spooks
they
can
be
guaranteed
to
give
the
government
line
when
it
counts
in
us
history
it
has
been
the
socialists
such
as
myself
who
have
been
persecuted
now
before
people
start
asserting
that
there
is
no
mechanism
by
which
the
administration
can
get
their
new
chip
adopted
without
legal
force
lets
try
thinking
in
the
first
place
the
clipper
chip
must
have
existed
for
several
years
as
a
defense
project
therefore
this
is
not
a
party
matter
at
all
george
bush
was
in
any
case
hardly
adverse
to
tapping
calls
he
was
chief
spook
remember
secondly
the
govt
can
quite
easily
apply
pressure
they
simply
ask
their
chums
who
they
give
huge
defense
contracts
to
motorola
etc
to
be
nice
boys
after
all
bill
is
giving
them
a
nice
little
trade
monopoly
since
the
chips
wont
be
avaliable
to
foreign
firms
thirdly
the
people
who
consider
the
democrats
to
be
socialist
are
not
the
same
as
the
ones
who
consider
socialists
to
be
communist
people
might
know
this
if
the
us
education
system
did
not
suffer
from
the
mcarthyite
and
dewy
version
of
political
correctness
the
sort
with

ever

ed
meese
pissed

have
it
was
when
he

that

the

the

the
press
given
to

will
only
increase
their
numbers
even
if
there
is
some
benefit
to
lawenforcement
through
the
use
of
big
brother
it
must
be
weighed
against
the
constitutional
and
civil
liberties
questions
involved
for
example
in
some
areas
of
the
world
torture
is
used
as
an
investigative
tool
by
the
local
lawenforcement
people
i
suspect
it
is
an
effective
means
of
obtaining
information
and
shortening
many
investigations
it
probably
also
helps
keep
the
conviction
rate
high
the
fact
that
the
torture
tool
is
not
used
in
this
country
even
with
a
court
order
obtained
by
showing
probable
cause
is
because
we
have
rightly
balanced
the
questions
of
expediency
and
what
is
ethically
and
morally
right
i
think
that
the
same
question
of
expediency
versus
morality
should
come
into
play
when
considering
the
use
of
big
brother
i
vote
for
morality
i
am
quite
disturbed
by
what
i
interpret
as
a
veiled
threat
to
prohibit
the
use
of
all
encryption
if
this
big
brother
chip
is
not
put
into
wide
spread
use
after
a
quick
reading
of
the
white

press
release
i
came
away
with
that
impression
to
most
of
the
american
public
the
word
hacker
has
rightly
or
wrongly
come
to
mean
high

adolescent
vandal
it
has
struck
me
that
most
of
the
people
posting
to
scicrypt
regarding
this
issue
are
intelligent
thoughtful
individuals
who
have
genuine
concerns
about
the
privacy
and
constitutional
issues
surrounding
big
brother
i
hope
that
the
use
of
big
brother
does
not
become
mandatory
and
other
encryption
become
illegal
i
would
hate
to
see
this

how

that

that

also
i
assume
that
if

the
only
use
would
be
storing

by

question

remember
to
tailor
it
to

the
general
public
may
be
slow
to
grasp
why
its
a
bad
idea
since
it
seems
so
technical
and
arcane
and
innocent
sounding
try
not
to
come
across
as
a
flaming
libertarian
paranoid
extremist
even
if
you
are
one

write
letters
and
make
phone
calls
to
your
member
of

in
your

as

many
members

issues
talk
to
those

involve
your
local

the
libertarian

would
certainly
be
interested
there
are
also
libertarian
wings
of
the

and
republican
parties
the
right

has
a
surprisingly
broad
appeal
spanning
all
parts

we
have

that
may
someday
find
themselves
facing
a
government
that
can
suppress
them
much
more
efficiently
if
these
trends
play
themselves
out
but
you
must
articulate
our
arguments
well

you
want
to
draw

people
who

mobilize

develop

the

should
be
lobbied
against

from

you
work

first
enlist
the
aid
of
your
coworkers
and
fellow
engineers
against

initiative
and
then
present
your
companys
management
with
a
united
front
of
engineering
talent
against
this
initiative
write
persuasive
memos
to
your

with

the

asking
but
with
millions
of
these
things
about
how
could
the
algorythm
possibly
stay
secret
couldnt
some
clever
hackers
just
grind
the
thing
down
layer
by
layer
and
see
how
it
worked

finger

subject
why
the
clipper
algorithm
is
secret
the
cryptographic
protocol
though
is
another
matter
i
see
no
valid
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
and
as
i
hope
ive
shown
above
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
do
things
that
arent
quite
as
bad
it
just
occurred
to
me
why
the
algorithm
is
secret
if
it
were
published
one
could
then
build
physically
identical
clone
versions
of
the
chip
that
would
interoperate
with
official
clipper
chips
but
the
cloner
wouldnt
provide
the
keys
to
the
escrow
houses
hmmn
or
is
there
a
technical
hack
that
ive
missed
eg
how
about
if
the
chips
were
made
unprogrammed
but
serialized
and
then
shipped
to
the
two
escrow
houses
who
programmed
in
their
halves
of
the
keys
but
in
a
way
that
requires
that
secret
keys
known
only
to
the
escrow
houses
be
installed
as
well
without
which
clone
versions
wouldnt
interoperate
this
is
getting
awfully
complicated

thats

if

itll

that
this
will
be
the

of

its

someone
peddling
snake
oil
and
the

is
a
major
improvement
in
telephone
security
to
what
exists
now
the
problem
is
that
with
any
security
scheme
of
this
kind
you
have
to
concern
yourself
with
the
weakest
link
in
the
chain
i
suspect
that
nsa
has
put
a
fairly
strong
encryption
algorithm
in
this
wiretap
chip
of
theirs
probably
at
least
as
strong
as
say
des
in
ofbmode
unfortunately
the
existence
of
the
keyregistry
system
seems
to
make
possible
all
kinds
of
possible
attacks
at
a
small
fraction
of
the
expense
of
trying
to
build
say
a
des
keysearch

as
originally
described
it
sounded
like
any
police
court
combination
could
acquire
the

for
a

i
hope
thats
not
the
case
since
it
would
imply
a
glaring

how
much
does
it
cost
to
find
one
crooked
jodge
and
one
crooked
cop
especially
for
a
foreign
intelligence
agency

organized
crime
boss
however
even
if
more
intelligent
schemes
are
used
to
allow
access
to
the
unencrypted
phone
conversations
there
will
be
weak
nesses
they
may
be
very
expensive
and
very
difficult
but
who
would
trust
hisher
confidential

to

that
for
say
could
by
cracked
one
time
in
a
hundred
des
for
all
the
complaints
about
a

would
probably
cost
several

but
the

wouldnt

hmmn
yeah
the

is
classified
because
a
military
contract
or
similar

equivalent
to

has
been

for
this
proprietary

the

a

is
that
patent
publicly

my
betting
is
that
that
too
is
classified
if
the

it
would
compromise
not

the

whats

anywhere
right
so
probably
there
will
be
some
way
of
getting

this

why
the

chip
initiative
is
a
bad
idea
remember
to
tailor
it
to
your

the
general
public
may
be
slow
to
grasp
why
its
a
bad
idea
since
it
seems
so
technical
and
arcane
and
innocent
sounding
try
not
to
come
across
as
a
flaming
libertarian
paranoid
extremist
even
if
you
are
one
as
a
flaming
libertarian
paranoid
extremist
iat
a
loss
for
specific
objections
that
dont
sound
frighteningly
technical
any
suggestions
perhaps
somebody
could
post
a
list
of
these
mobilize
opposition
in
industry
companies
that
will
presumably
develop
products
that
will
incorporate
the
clipper
chip
should
be
lobbied
against
it
from
within
and
from
without
if
you
work
for
a
telecommunications
equipment
vendor
first
enlist
the
aid
of
your
coworkers
and
fellow
engineers
against
this
initiative
and
then
present
your
companys
management
with
a
united
front
of
engineering
talent
against
this
initiative
write
persuasive
memos
to
your
management
with
your
name
and
your
colleagues
names
on
it
hold
meetings
on
it
one
way
to
do
this
might
be
to
suggest
that
these
companies
should
be
implementing
their
own
schemes
not
being
limited
to
the
govts
scheme
i
find
that
most
of
my
reasons
for
opposition
to
the
clipper
scheme
are
algoritm
insecurity
and
mistrust
of
the
govtnsa
these
are
hard
to
sell
in
letters
to
the
editor
and
to
nontechnical
people
any
hints
or
advice
maybe
a
small
faqtype
thing
why
should
i
hate
clipper
would
be
a
good
idea

the
cryptographic
protocol
though
is
another
matter
i
see
no
valid
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
and
as
i
hope
ive
shown
above
there
it
just
occurred
to
me
why
the
algorithm
is
secret
if
it
were
published
one
could
then
build
physically
identical
clone
versions
i
recall
seeing
a
post
some
time
ago
saying
that
if
the
details
of
an
encryption
scheme
couldnt
be
revealed
then
the
encryption
scheme
is
worthless
i
believe
the
statement
was
in
response
to
somebody
saying
that
they
had
some
new
snazzy
scheme
but
the
algorithm
was
a
secret
does
this
algorithm
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
scheme
is
secret
or
is
it
for
the
stated
reasons
above

i

this
just

i
guess
they
beat
me
to

anyway
i
think
it
would
be
a
great
idea
to
develop
such
a
product
perhaps
in
the
underground
as
it
would
otherwise
probably
become
illegal
pretty
quickly
here
its
really
very
feasible
and
shouldnt
be
too
expensive
all
thats
needed
is
a
box
with
a
phone
jack
on
one
side
a
dsp
in
the
middle
to
do
codec
functions
of
speechcompressed

and
an

the
other
side
youd
plug
your
phone
into
it
plug
the
into
your
computer
and
have
a
good
old
fashioned
normal
modem
on
your
other
port
the
cpu
in
the
middle
would
do
the
encryption
with
a
version
of
pgp
modified
to
work
on
a
byte
stream
with
or
better
modems
to
carry
the

it
should
work
quality
would
only
be
marginally
lower
than
a
normal
telephone
at
the
very
highest
price
you
could
use
one
of
those
voicemail
compatible
modems
to
do
the
digitisation
that
puts
an
upper
bound
of
about
on
the
cost
of
such
a
box
in
practice
you
really
ought
to
be
able
to
get
the

well
below

if
i
knew
how

i
dont
the
reason

is
that
hardly

will

im

however
we
can
get
about

of

and

it
might
then
be
trivial
to
run

over

perhaps
we
should
start
thinking
now
of
a
standard
to
keep
voice
on
the

compatible
for
everyone

sidestep
the

the

in
his

with

naturally
rebel

because
then
cryptography
that
is
not
guaranteed
to
be
breakable
by
the
government
will
already
have
been
outlawed
after
all
youve
already
got
privacy
that
is
said
to
be
breakable
only
by
the
law
enforcement
agencies
so
if
you
are
lawabiding
you
have
no
reasons
to
use
a
stronger
one
right
so
if
you
are
using
a
stronger
one
you
have
something
to
hide
from
the
law
enforcement
agencies
right
something
unlawful
right
therefore
strong
crypto
is
a
clear
idndication
that
you
are
doing
something
unlawful
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
president
if
they
stated
there
were
no
trap
considering
the
level
of
competence
in
cryptology
that
you
have
demonstrated
in
your
messages
you
would
trust
just
anything
and
no
this
is
not
an
ad
hominem
attack
its
an
attack
against
the
contents
of
your
messages
grin
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committee
of
independent
experts
examined
the
thing
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
reported
back
that
it
was
secure
and
how
do
you
know
that
these
experts
are
not
corrupted
and
how
do
you
know
that
they
will
not
make
a
mistake
and
how
do
you
know
that
the
version
of
the
algorithm
they
will
be
let
to
examine
is
the
same
as
the
one
that
will
be
really
used
regarding
the
mistake
even
the
few
information
they
have
let
out
has
revealed
a
serious
security
hole
in
the
protocol
the
key
is
split
in
two
ones
thus
the
whole
system
is
easily
breakable
if
you
have
only
one
of
the
keys
id
trust
something
from
the
nsa
long
before
id
trust
something
from
some
swiss
or
anybody
japanese
the
swiss
or
the
japanese
are
motivated
by
simple
greed
nsa
is
motivated
by
their
wish
to
control
the
people
thats
why
the
drug
dealers
have
their
accounts
in
swiss
banks
instead
of
in
american
ones
for
some
reason
they
do
trust
the
swiss
banks
more
guess
theyll
trust
the
swiss
encryption
more
too
i
see
idea
becoming
suddenly
popular
this
may
seem
surprising
to
some
here
but
i
suggest
most
corporations
would
feel
the
same
way
mostmanysome
pick
one
corporations
have
an
attitude
that
the
nsa
is
part
of
our
government
and
we
support
our
government
as
one
very
famous
ceo
put
it
to
me
one
day
its
not
surprising
at
all
but
not
because
of
the
reason
you
give
its
because
it
is
obvious
that
the
us
government
has
put
a
lot
of
money
behind
this
program
and
it
will
support
it
thus
most
corporations
will
try
to
get
their
piece
from
the
pie
by
supporting
it
too
the
same
good
old
greed
strong
encryption
is
not
widely
available
now
not
because
of
some
plot
but
because
the
companies
dont
see
much
money
in
it
it
will
be
available
even
less
if
the
companies
can
see
any
penalties
associated
with
it
just
some
perspective
from
another
point
of
view
yeah
just
as
i
predicted
you
are
here
again

support

the

made
hell
they
probably
based
the

on
the

that
cracks

that
way
its
easier
to
break

but
since
it
is
a

no

knows
that
they

crack
it
so
easily
agreed
no

such

surely
the

is
to
make

think
that
hisher

while
james

can
if

have

thatll
be
quite
a

if

off
i
thought
that
the

were
going

release

a

would
then
study

for

david
sternlight
writes
though
some
may
argue
about
the
nose
of
the
camel
its
worth
noting
that
the
government
proposal
is
limited
to
scrambled
telephony
if
it
is
only
used
for
that
purpose
and
does
not
extend
to
electronic
mail
or
file
as
usual
david
sternlight
is
demonstrating
his
inability
to
read
the
proposal
clearly
states
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
it
speaks
about
telecommunications
in
general
read
it
again
david
maybe
youll
understand
it
the
next
time
nah
probably
not
encryption
then
it
is
an
improvement
over
the
current
massproduced
standard
civilian
technology
which
with
a
few
exceptions
is
limited
to
easytobreak
inverters
thats
exactly
what
the
government
wants
all
sheepminded
people
to
think
lets
look
at
the
current
situation
it
allows
to
almost
anybody
to
eavesdrop
almost
everybody
unless
secure
and
i
mean
secure
encryption
is
used
what
will
happen
when
if
ha
optimists
the
new
proposal
gets
accepted
almost
nobody
except
some
will
be
able
to
eavesdrop
everybody
else
but
the
ability
of
these
some
to
eavesdrop
will
be
guaranteed
the
proposal
emphasizes
on
the
former
almost
nobody
which
is
clearly
an
improvement
and
forgets
to
mention
the
drawbacks
of
the
latter
guaranteed
yes
my
statement
assumes
that
the
next
step
will
be
to
make
the
strong
crypto
unlawful
you
think
that
it
will
not
happen
good
luck
note
that
the
big
issue
for
the
feds
is
the
continued
ability
to
wiretap
its
not
just
continued
ability
its
guaranteed
ability
before
we
go
off
the
deep
end
with
long
discusions
about
secure
crypto
for
email
and
files
lets
focus
on
this
yeah
thats
exactly
what
your
government
wants
you
to
think
lets
take
small
steps
one
at
a
time
concentrate
on
the
current
one
dont
think
about
the
future
trust
us
one
question
that
was
not
asked
in
the
release
is
whether
this
proposal
is
limited
to
telephony
or
if
the
government
intends
to
expand
it
its
not
asked
because
the
proposal
clearly
says
that
this
is
the
intention
they
unlike
you
read
what
they
write
though
i
share
many
of
the
concerns
expressed
by
some
i
find
the
proposal
less
threatening
than
many
others
since
right
now
most
americans
have
no
secure
telephony
and
any
jerk
with
a
pair
of
clip
leads
and
a
goat
can
eavesdrop
this
would
also
plug
up
the
security
hole
in
cellular
and
cordless
phones
yes
it
will
it
will
stop
the
jerk
who
is
eavesdropping
now
it
will
allow
only
to
the
government
to
eavesdrop
if
the
scheme
is
secure
of
course
which
is
yet
to
be
proven
but
how
do
you
know
that
the
jerk
you
are
fearing
now
will
not
get
a
government
job
tomorrow
the
new
proposal
guarantees
him
the
ability
to
eavesdrop
then
hell
that
will
even
motivate
him
to
get
that
job
if
he
indeed
is
that
mentally
pervert
reading
between
the
lines
i
infer
that
the
system
is
highly
secure
without
access
to
the
keys
great
the
greatest
cryptographer
of
all
times
david
sternlight
tm
has
succeeded
to
evaluate
the
new
system
in
the
absense
of
any
details
whatsoever
and
has
concluded
that
it
is
highly
secure
i
guess
that
comes
from
the
background
of
working
some
years
for
the
two
major
crypto
evaluating
companies
right
gee
now
the
government
can
save
all
that
money
and
trouble
to
ask
a
secret
council
of
crypto
experts
to
secretly
analyse
the
new
secret
method
for
david
sternlight
has
already
done
all
the
job
for
them
this
would
meet
the
needs
of
us
businesses
confronted
by
rich
and
powerful
adversaries
including
french
and
japanese
security
services
and
rich
japanese
companies
it
allows
the
nsa
to
make
available
some
of
its
better
stuff
while
protecting
law
enforcement
needs
trust
us
were
from
the
government
and
were
here
to
help
you
most
legitimate
us
corporations
trust
the
nsa
and
would
be
delighted
to
have
a
highsecurity
system
certified
by
them
even
at
the
price
of
depositing
keys
in
escrow
i
see
no
difficulty
in
creating
a
reliable
those
who
are
prepared
to
trade
their
liberties
for
the
promises
of
future
safety
do
not
deserve
either
this
or
something
like
that
i
dont
have
the
exact
quote
but
the
meaning
is
the
same
has
been
said
by
one
of
your
great
men
maybe
you
should
study
their
works
more
carefully
if
you
have
the
brains
to
understand
them
of
course
from
my
point
of
view
this
is
a
fair
starting
point
there
are
concerns
that
need
to
be
addressed
including
the
reliability
of
the
escrows
but
in
the
main
question
is
to
guarantee
to
availability
of
really
secure
cryptography
to
the
masses
gee
if
the
proposal
was
saying
we
guarantee
that
every
american
will
still
have
the
full
right
to
use
any
kind
of
encryption
she
would
like
and
regard
this
proposal
as
just
a
default
voluntary
implementation
there
would
have
been
much
less
opposition
for
some
reason
they
didnt
even
try
to
promise
you
that
i
wonder
why
was
orwell
off
only
by
years
return
we
get
access
to
highsecurity
crypto
no
in
return
you
get
crypto
that
is
guaranteed
to
be
crippled
many
have
suggested
that
des
and
other
systems
may
be
breakable
by
the
nsa
and
hence
others
similarly
skilled
and
endowed
while
the
above
is
just
rumors
and
while
even
if
it
is
true
it
is
not
done
easily
the
new
scheme
can
is
guaranteed
to
be
easily
breakable
by
anybody
who
has
the
two
keys
it
might
be
also
breakable
by
somebody
who
does
not
have
them
but
knows
the
right
trick
or
who
has
only
one
of
them
nsa
also
told
you
that
des
is
secure
why
dont
you
simply
trust
them
huh
there
is
at
least
a
good
possibility
which
should
be
checked
that
the
proposed
system
is
not
so
breakable
it
doesnt
have
to
it
is
guaranteed
to
be
easily
breakable
just
get
the
keys
it
might
be
even
easier
but
until
there
is
some
evidence
this
is
just
a
wild
speculation
be
nor
does
it
have
to
have
trapdoors
if
the
government
can
get
the
keys
the
trapdoors
are
there
in
governments
hands
the
keys
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
court
order
thus
they
can
protect
legitimate
communications
against
economic
adversaries
while
still
being
able
to
eavesdrop
on
crooks
pursuant
to
a
court
order
legitimate
and
who
decides
what
communications
are
legitimate
oh
i
guess
its
the
government
right
the
guys
who
already
have
the
keys
its
kinda
if
i
have
the
keys
from
your
car
and
i
am
asked
to
decide
who
has
the
right
to
use
it
legitimately
in
discussing
this
lets
try
to
avoid
the
nastiness
personal
attacks
and
noise
of
some
previous

impossible
since
you
are
demonstrating

my
understanding
is
that
em

is
not
encrypted
under
sk
called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to

is
held
by

enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
will
also
check
it
out
but
this
is
sunday
so
i
did
not
want
to
wait
the

will
be
generated
as
the
xor
of
two
random

and
which
will

derived
from

that

with
two

similarly
compute

and
starting
with

im
unlear
about
whether
the

and
change
the
fact
that
theyre
called

suggests
they
might
then
and
are
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first

form
and
the
next

form
the
remaining
bits
are
discarded
authorities
who
these
escrow
authorities
will
be
is
still
to
be
decided
by
the
attorney
general
but
it
was
stressed
to
me
that
they
will
not
be
nsa
or
law
enforcement
agencies
that
they
must
be
parties
acceptable
to
the
users
of
the
system
as
unbiased
marty
is
right
on
this
and
the
fbi
has
asked
me
for
suggestions
please
pass
them
to
me
along
with
your
reasons
in
addition
to
martys
criteria
i
would
add
that
the
agencies
must
have
an
established
record
of
being
able
to
safeguard
highly
sensitive
information
some
suggestions
ive
received
so
far
include
sri
rand
mitre
the
national
labs
sandia
lanl
los
alamos
treasury
gao
when
a
court
order
obtains
and
and
thence
k
the
law
enforcement
agency
will
use
sk
to
decrypt
all
information
flowing
on
the
suspected
link
aside
it
is
my
guess
that
they
may
do
this
constantly
on
all
links
with
or
without
a
court
order
since
it
is
almost
impossible
to
tell
which
links
over
which
a
message
will
flow
my
understanding
is
that
there
will
be
only
one
decode
box
and
that
it
will
be
operated
by
the
fbi
the
service
provider
will
isolate
the
communications
stream
and
pass
it
to
the
fbi
where
it
will
pass
through
the
decode
box
which
will
have
been
keyed
with
k
for
the
wiretap
authorizations
when
levy
asked
for
the
details
so
he
could
review
the
cases
as
required
by
law
the
agent
told
him
that
his
predecessors
just
turned
over
blank
signed
forms
every
time
levi
did
not
comply
and
changed
the
system
but
the
lesson
is
clear
no
single
person
or
authority
should
have
the
power
to
authorize
wiretaps
no
single
person
does
at
least
for
fbi
taps
after
completing
a
mound
of
paperwork
an
agent
must
get
the
approval
of
several
people
on
a
chain
that
includes
fbi
legal
counsel
before
the
request
is
even
taken
to
the
attorney
general
for
final
approval

a

in
which
he
comments
on
the
effects
of
the
clipper
chip
on
state
and
local
police
actually
reading
between
the
lines
it
could
be
a
very
good
thing
for
civil
liberties
in
one
respect
since
it
will
at
least
prevent
cowboy
cops
and
cowboy
state
and
local
agancies
from
reading
your
traffic
if
they
tap
it
illegally
instead
of
reading
between
the
lines
try
to
think
a
little
bit
ok
if
thats
way
too
difficult
to
you
here
are
some
hints
indeed
the
new
proposal
imposes
some
additional
burocratic
burden
on
the
local
police
if
they
badly
want
to
tape
the
magic
cookie
recipie
that
your

is
telling
you
on
the
phone
so
guess
what
they
will
do
propose
that
the
new
technology
is
removed
or
implement
some
facilitations
of
course
you
wont
want
to
wait
until
they
get
the
approval
from
two
different
agencies
to
decrypt
the
conversation
between
two
child
molesters
because
meanwhile
those
two
child
molesters
might
be
conspiring
about
molesting
your
child
right
so
there
should
be
some
way
for
them
to
get
access
to
those
keys
quickly
right
like
they
could
have
a

of
the

misinterpretation
though

a
crime
in
itself
is
what
united
states
lawyers
use
to
make
their
bread
and
butter
in
manchester
ct
a
few
years
ago
a
small
company
wanted
to
run
a
game
system
galled
lasergames
similar
in
many
aspects
to
photon
tm
three
lawyers
and
about
a
hundred
citizens
found
an
ancient
law
in
manchesters
books
which
clearly
from
context
was
designed
to
prohibit
travelling
carnivals
by
enumerating
the
features
of
a
carnival
which
they
felt
at
the
time
made
the
prohibition
obvious
among
these
things
was
shooting
galleries
which
is
what
the
lawyers
for
the
opposition
to
lasergames
wanted
to
harp
upon
the
judge
took
the
two
words
from
this
law
completely
out
of
context
and
ruled
that
lasergames
could
not
operate
in
manchester
keep
in
mind
that
most
travelling
carnivals
use
projectile
weapons
in
their
shooting
galleries
and
not
light
beams
clearly
from
context
lasergames
got
shafted
but
if
the
two
words
are
applied
their
denial
of
operating
permission
was
justified
if
i
had
the
text
of
the
law
id
post
it
but
im
afraid
i
dont
remember
it

report
on
privacyprotecting

available
i
recently
published
a
new
privacyprotecting
offline
electronic
cash
system
as
a
technical
report
at
cwi
being
a
phdstudent
at
david
chaums
cryptographygroup
our
group
has
a
long
history
in
research
in
the
field
of
privacyprotecting
cash
systems
the
report
is
called
contains
pages
and
can
be
retrieved
from
ftpcwinl
from
the
directory
pubcwireportsaa
the
postscriptfile
is
suitable
for
laserprinters
abstract
from
coverpage
we
present
a
new
offline
electronic
cash
system
based
on
a
problem
called
the
representation
problem
of
which
little
use
has
been
made
in
literature
thus
far
our
system
is
the
first
to
be
based
entirely
on
discrete
logarithms
using
the
representation
problem
as
a
basic
concept
some
techniques
are
introduced
that
enable
us
to
construct
protocols
for
withdrawal
and
payment
that
do
not
use
the
cut
and
choose
methodology
of
earlier
systems
as
a
consequence
our
cash
system
is
much
more
efficient
in
both
computation
and
communication
complexity
than
any
such
system
proposed
previously
another
important
aspect
of
our
system
concerns
its
provability
contrary
to
previously
proposed
systems
its
correctness
can
be
mathematically
proven
to
a
very
great
extent
specifically
if
we
make
one
plausible
assumption
concerning
a
single
hashfunction
the
ability
to
break
the
system
seems
to
imply
that
one
can
break
the
diffiehellman
problem
our
system
offers
a
number
of
extensions
that
are
hard
to
achieve
in
previously
known
systems
in
our
opinion
the
most
interesting
of
these
is
that
the
entire
cash
system
including
all
the
extensions
can
be
incorporated
in
a
setting
based
on
wallets
with
observers
which
has
the
important
advantage
that
doublespending
can
be
prevented
in
the
first
place
rather
than
detecting
the
identity
of
a
doublespender
after
the
fact
in
particular
it
can
be
incorporated
even
under
the
most
stringent
requirements
conceivable
about
the
privacy
of
the
user
which
seems
to
be
impossible
to
do
with
previously
proposed
systems
another
benefit
of
our
system
is
that
framing
attempts
by
a
bank
have
negligible
probability
of
success
independent
of
computing
power
by
a
simple
mechanism
from
within
the
system
which
is
something
that
previous
solutions
lack
entirely
furthermore
the
basic
cash
system
can
be
extended
to
checks
multishow
cash
and
divisibility
while
retaining
its
computational
efficiency
cryptographers
are
challenged
to
try
to
break
this
system
i
made
a
particular
effort
to
keep
the
report
as
selfcontained
as
possible
nevertheless
if
you
have
any
questions
please
email
to
me
and
i
will
try
to
reply
as
good
as

the

of
this
is
theoretical
to
me
i
understand
believe
it
or
not
and
there
are
any
number
of
kinds
of
conversation
and
communication
i
engage
in
that
i
wouldnt
even
consider
using
this
scheme
for
on
the
other
hand
i
dont
see
clipper
as
providing
a
secure
channelit
just
prevents
casual
eavesdropping
this
is
part
of
why
i
am
not
worried
about
it
per
se
trying
to
look
at
clipper
as
a
serious
security
tool
is
simply
ludicrous
its
a
voice
scrambler
nothing
more
there
is
still
plenty
of
market
for
real
crypto
as
for
its
better
than
the
status
quo
well
first
of
all
you
can
get
a
cryptophone
from
companies
like
cylink
today
and
they
work
well
they
cost
an
arm
and
a
leg
though
clipper
is
obviously
aimed
at
the
mass
market
it
certainly
wont
put
cylink
out
of
business
in
addition
a
number
of
groups
are
now
working
on
building
software
to
turn
any
pc
into
a
privacy
enhanced
phone
right
now
and
they
are
all
working
in
overdrive
mode
this
is
old
news
i
can
do
this
now
there
are
no
crypto
restrictions
yet
you
can
use
anything
you
want
right
now
the
point
is
to
maintain
that
right
there
are
restrictions
example
were
a
networking
software
vendor
with
a
large
overseas
share
of
our
market
we
cannot
currently
ship
pem
or
even
simple
des
in
our
products
without
casebycase
approval
from
the
department
of
state
itar
presents
a
material
trade
barrier
to
us
firms
trying
to
compete
in
international
information
systems
markets
sure
you
can
use
whatever
freebie
software
you
want
to
talk
over
bbss
in
the
usa
i
on
the
other
hand
want
strong
crypto
pkcs
for
example
to
be
the
default
for
electronic
mail
worldwide
i
want
priests
to
be
able
to
hear
confession
over
email
i
want
lawyers
to
be
able
to
talk
to
clients
in
confidence
over
email
or
doctors
talk
with
patients
i
want
to
be
able
to
order
products
from
my
favorite
japanese
mailorder
catalog
over
the
net
i
want
to
be
able
to
sign
contracts
transact
business
and
so
on
electronically
this
is
so
far
infeasible
as
a
result
of
the
current
restrictions
on
crytographic
systems
especially
beyond
the
borders
of
the
usa
clipper
is
irrelevant
and
if
it
distracts
the
authorities
into
feeling
safe
all
the
better
its
only
danger
is
if
it
emboldens
them
into
trying
to
put
more
restrictions
into
place
on
the
theory
that
it
is
good
enough
for
anyone
who
has
nothing
to
hide
that
argument
is
of
course
utter
bs
just
as
much
as
no

your

included
a
brief
passage
concerning
selection
of

agencies
i
am
glad
to
see
that
the
proposal
as
written
states
that
the
escrow
agencies
wont
be
law
enforcement
agencies
i
would
argue
however
that
one
of
the
escrow
agencies
shouldnt
be
federal
at
all
as
a
private
citizen
i
would
feel
much
more
secure
in
my
person
and
papers
knowing
that
an
organization
committed
to
individual
civil
liberties
the
aclu
and
the
nra
come
to
mind
was
safeguarding
half
of
my
key
both
the
aclu
and
the
nra
are
resistent
to
government
pressure
by
the
simple
expedient
fact
that
they
are
not
supported
funded
or
overtly
controlled
by
the
government
of
those
federal
and
federally
funded
candidate
agencies
that
you

i
have
the
following
comments
sri
rand
mitre
and
national
labs
i
agree
that
they
have
great
experience
safeguarding
sensitive
information
i
am
not
convinced
that
they
would
adequately
safeguard
this
information
since
in
any
case
requiring
disclosure
theres
likely
to
be
sigificant
pressure
for
disclosure
possibly
wrongful
disclosure
gao
perhaps
i

to
act

i
agree
with
you
in

those

almost
always
act
properly
however
there
have
been
enough
cases

to
clarify
some
of
the
features
of
clipper
please
feel
free
to
distribute
this
and
my
other
messages
on

the
name
of
the
encryption
algorithm
is
skipjack
martin
hellman
had
written
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
added
to
produce
a
three
part
message
which
will
then
be
encrypted
under
the
system
key
sk
producing
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
to
which
i
responded
my
understanding
is
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
was
correct
in
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
however
skipjack
being
a
singlekey
system
there
is
of
course
not
a
separate
decrypt
key
for
the
family
key
sk
the
unit
key
also
called
the
chip
key
is
generated
from
the
serial
number
n
as
follows
let
and
be
bit
blocks
derived
from
n
and
let
and
be
two
seeds
used
as
keys
compute
the
block
note
that
this
is
like
using
the
des
in
triple
encryption
mode
with
two
keys
similarly
compute
blocks
and
starting
with
and
im
unlear
about
whether
the
keys
and
change
the
fact
that
theyre
called
seeds
suggests
they
might
then
and
are
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
form
and
the
next
bits
form
the
remaining
bits
are
discarded
the
seeds
and
do
not
change
the
whole
process
is
performed
on
a
laptop
computer
and
and
are
supplied
by
two
independent
people
so
that
no
one
person
knows
both
the
same
and
are
used
during
an
entire
programming
session
to
generate
keys
for
a
stream
of
serial
numbers
everything
is
discarded
at
the
end
the
computer
could
be
thrown
out
if
desired
the
serial
number
is
bits
and
the
values
and
are
formed
by
padding
the
serial
number
with
fixed
blocks
separate
padding
for
each
value
the
resulting
keys
and
are
output
onto
separate
floppy
disks
paired
up
with
their
serial

each
pair
is
stored
in

re

technical
details
hmm
followup
on
my
own
posting
well
who
cares
first
let
me
try
to
work
out
the
facts
that
we
get
to
know
about
the
clipperchip
from
what
hellman
and
denning
were
able
to
tell
us
the
chip
itself
is
not
confined
to
digital
telephony
but
performs
general
encryption
in
a
symmetric
manner
the
chip
supports
cfb
ofb
ecb
and
whatever
the
fourth
mode
of
operation
for
des
is
the
algorithm
consists
of
rounds
of
whatever
and
takes
keys
input
data
seems
to
be
bit
yes
so
if
two
people
want
secure
communication
whatever
that
means
when
clipper
is
involved
they
have
first
to
agree
on
one
secret
key
or
is
it
one
key
per
direction
they
can
exchange
this
key
via
dhschemes
or
however
somehow
the
two
feed
their
so
won
secret
key
into
the
clipperchip
which
is
now
ready
to
work
the
clipper
chip
carries
an
unique
serialnumber
bits
and
keybits
these
keybits
seem
to
have
been
gained
by
encrypting
the
serialnumber
with
seedbits
the
seedbits
seem
not
to
be
stored
in
the
chip
at
beginning
of
communication
and
perhaps
at
certain
invtervals
whithin
before
sending
the
fist
real
output
of
the
first
encryption
the
clipper
chip
puts
out
packets
i
guess
which
represent
the
serial
number
and
the
session
key
this
might
look
like
x
ek
serial
number
where
x
is
a
transformation
of
these
packets
involving
a
familykey
this
familyspkey
is
equal
for
all
chips
x
might
be
a
simple
xor
after
that
the
digital
phonecall
can
be
done
as
usual
every
packet
being
encrypted
and
decrypted
by
clipper
denning
describes
how
and
shall
be
generated
using
a
seed
of
bits
now
leaving
alone
politics
which
does
not
concern
me
as
much
as
you
not
being
an
american
citicientm
there
are
some
weak
points
in
this
scheme
which
might
be
exploited
by
several
parties
as
far
as
i
know
about
the
generation
of
and
look
like
the
obvious
backdoor
they
could
be
used
to
generate
the
chipkeys
by
knowing
the
serialnumber
and
also
the
familykey
of
the
chip
i
really
cant
imagine
why
these
seeds
would
be
needed
otherwise
as
true
randomsources
for
the
generation
of
the
can
be
bought
for
not
to
much
money
then
the
escrows
each
of
them
will
get
bit
of
a
key
security
could
as
little
as
existant
be
maximized
by
giving
them
each
which
have
to
be
xored
together
to
give
the
now
lets
simply
assume
the
escrows
are
trustworthy
and
cant
be
fooled
by
criminals
or
law
enforchemnt
agencies
and
there
will
be
no
quarrel
between
escrows
and
lea
which
would
hinder
the
lea
in
doing
their
duties
and
so
on
and
so
on
once
the
keys
are
surrendered
the
corresponding
chip
is
compromised
forever
not
very
clever
imho
how
about
sending
in
the
encrypted
sessionkeys
for
each
phonecall
that
the
police
or
whoever
wants
to
listen
to
escrows
could
then
simply
decode
this
sessionkey
and
send
it
back
to
police
and
would
naturally
not
do
this
after
the
warrant
has
expired
this
would
be
a
better
technical
solution
but
i
guess
politics
will
not
work
that
way
apparently
as
miss
dennings
stated
the
only
one
performing
actually
decodes
of
intercepted
messages
shall
be
the
fbi
great
so
local
guys
can
not
inter
cept
understand
your
traffic
anymore
does
this
mean
that
the
fbi
monopolizes
the
right
to
do
legal
wiretaps
how
is
law
over
there
i
have
no
idea
who
is
allowed
to
tap
and
who
not
this
certainly
means
that
watched
communi
cations
will
be
routed
automatically
from
the
serviceproviding
company
to
the
fbi
if
the
communicaiton
is
a
watched
one
and
this
means
as
far
as
i
understand
it
that
the
familykey
has
to
be
known
by
each
switching
company
and
those
providing
cellularphone
servies
etcetc
so
the
familykey
will
not
be
very
secret
and
thus
serialnumbers
of
calls
will
be
readable
by
anybody
who
cares
i
like
trafficanalysis
what
do
you
guess
what
happens
if
you
use
the
chip
in
ecb
mode
and
the
first
few
packets
of
the
chip
are
somehow
lost
or
garbled
so
the
session
key
would
not
be
actually
broadcasted
over
the
line
hmmm
shouldnt
be
so
difficult
to
do
that
and
now
a
last
point
for
the
other
side
after
all
i
have
read
and
heard
about
clipper
not
the

language

it
seems
to
have
many

which
shold
not

knowing
that
we
have

our

seize
our
property
against
the
fifth
amendment
of
our
constitution
tells
me
that
we
are
absolving
ourselves
of
our
responsibility
for
selfgovernance
we
have
to
take
our
government
back
from
the
selfserving
politicians
who
create
laws
and
rules
only
to
better
their
positions
within
the
government
we
have
allowed
them
to
take
too
much
power
from
the
people
of
this
nation
that
situation
has
to
be
changed
allowing
the
law
enforcement
agencies
to
use
the
seized
property
to
payoff
drug
informants
who
lie
and
continue
to
deal
in
drugs
is
tantamount
to
making
a
pact
with
the
devil
himself
its
a
vicious
cycle
the
law
enforcement
agencies
are
motivated
to
seize
property
to
fund
their
own
activities
and
having
no
easy
way
for
the
citizen
to
regain
the
property
intact
once
taken
gives
even
more
incentive
for
the
agencies
to
take
property
its
also
interesting
to
note
that
two
months

rush
limbaugh
said
that
clinton
would
have
the

out
in

shortly
clinton

his

control
anytime
a
leader
believes
in
that
the

will
use
every
means
possible
to
retain
that
control
and
take
more
we
have
to
take
our

back
otherwise
we
will
end
up
living

to
improve

telephone
encryption
and

are
years
behind

the

a
clasic
strawman
claim
in
the
context
of
nonrealtime
circuits
such
as
email
and
the

the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
i
would
modestly
propose
that
a
mandated
use
of
isdn
would
do
more
for
commun
ications
than
this
lot
for
too
long
there
has
been
little
or
no
dialogue
between
our
private
sector
and
the
law
enforcement
community
to
resolve
the
tension
between
economic
vitality
and
the
real
challenges
of
protecting
americans
rather
than
use
technology
to
accommodate
the
sometimes
competing
interests
of
economic
growth
privacy
and
law
enforcement
previous
policies
have
pitted
government
against
industry
and
the
rights
of
privacy
against
law
enforcement
sophisticated
encryption
technology
has
been
used
for
years
to
protect
electronic
funds
transfer
it
is
now
being
used
to
protect
electronic
mail
and
computer
files
while
encryption
normmaly
des
technology
can
help
americans
protect
business
secrets
and
the
unauthorized
release
of
personal
information
it
also
can
be
used
by
terrorists
drug
dealers
and
other
criminals
note
the
use
of
the
word
business
in
the
above
the
whole
tenor
of
this
release
seems
to
be
establishing
a
ground
rule
that
only
business
use
is
legitimate
for
debate
if
you
want
the
nothings
you
drop
in
your
wifes
ear
to
remain
secret
and
private
that
is
not
even
on
the
agenda
for
debate
note
that
there
is
no
role
for
you
to
contain
private
info
in
this
the
only
reference
is
to
information
already
in
the
hands
of
others
the
unauthorized
release
bit
is
also
drawing
a
long
bow
most
of
these
cases
are
by
people
who
have
legitimate
access
abusing
it
and
revealing
or
often
selling
the
info
these
people
are
of
course
in
this
proposal
the
people
who
will
have
the
keys
the
criminals
also
use
lawers
courts
the
cia
whitehouse
officials
and
pens
to
go
about
their
business
when
will
they
be
outlawed
as
well
yeah
several
of
them
would
be
a
better
idea
than
clipper
them
again
the
protections
of
law
and
the
courts
have
been
seriously
erroded
over
the
last
decade
ofr
so
a
stateoftheart
microcircuit
called
the
clipper
chip
has
been
developed
by
government
engineers
the
chip
represents
a
nsa
new
approach
to
encryption
technology
yeah
this
bit
is
very
true
it
can
be
used
in
new
relatively
inexpensive
encryption
devices
that
can
be
attached
to
an
ordinary
telephone
it
scrambles
telephone
communications
using
an
encryption
algorithm
that
is
more
powerful
than
many
in
commercial
use
today
note
the
repeated
mixing
of
telephone
scrabeling
and
encryption
a
demo
of
the
above
claim
on
an
ordanary
pots
would
be
a
good
nights
entertainment
i
suspect
note
also
the
many
not
all
as
the
general
tone
implies
this
new
technology
will
help
companies
protect
proprietary
information
protect
the
privacy
of
personal
phone
conversations
and
prevent
unauthorized
release
of
data
transmitted
electronically
at
the
same
time
this
technology
preserves
the
ability
of
federal
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies
to
intercept
lawfully
the
phone
conversations
of
criminals
the
case
record
seems
to
indicate
that
what
is
needed
is
a
brutal
tightening
of
the
current
abuses
i
have
not
heard
yet
of
a
case
that
was
impeaded
by
the
use
of
secure
encryption
by
the
men
in
black
the
other
side
abuse
by
law
enforcers
is
well
documented
even
by
govt
agencies
and
the
phone
vs
other
coms
is
blurred
yet
again
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
a
keyescrow
system
will
be
established
to
ensure
that
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
protect
the
privacy
of
lawabiding
americans
lets
run
that
line
twice
not
very
carefully
what
it
says
the
stated
purpose
of
the
key
eschrow
is
to
make
the
use
of
clipper
compulsory
note
the
word
ensure
as
to
protect
or
lawabiding
i
will
leave
to
you
so
to
the
person
who
asked
if
it
included
the
outlawing
of
other
encryptions
the
answer
in
this
press
release
is
yes
each
device
containing
the
chip
will
have
two
unique
keys
numbers
that
will
be
needed
by
authorized
government
agencies
to
decode
messages
encoded
by
the
device
when
the
device
is
manufactured
the
two
keys
will
be
deposited
separately
in
two
keyescrow
data
bases
that
will
be
established
by
the
attorney
general
access
to
these
keys
will
be
limited
to
government
officials
with
legal
authorization
to
conduct
a
wiretap
just
as
they
only
can
wiretap
now
with
a
warrent
the
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
just
makes
sure
that
the
illegal
ones
are
preserved
to
demonstrate
the
effectiveness
of
this
new
technology
the
attorney
general
will
soon
purchase
several
thousand
of
the
new
devices
in
addition
respected
experts
from
outside
the
government
will
be
offered
access
to
the
confidential
details
of
the
algorithm
to
assess
its
capabilities
and
publicly
report
their
findings
where
do
you
find
many
experts
any
ex
kgb
people
looking
for
a
contract
and
as
a
later
posting
asks
what
of
the
stuiiis
they
already
have
it
will
be
very
interesting
to
see
if
the
military
and
us
embasies
start
to
use
it
after
all
it
is
secure
isnt
it
the
govt
will
answer
that
point
by
its
own
actions
the
chip
is
an
important
step
in
addressing
the
problem
of
encryptions
dualedge
sword
encryption
helps
to
protect
the
privacy
of
individuals
and
industry
but
it
also
can
shield
criminals
and
terrorists
we
need
the
clipper
chip
and
other
approaches
that
can
both
provide
lawabiding
citizens
with
access
to
the
encryption
they
need
and
prevent
criminals
from
using
it
to
hide
their
illegal
activities
in
order
to
assess
technology
trends
and
explore
new
approaches
like
the
keyescrow
system
the
president
has
directed
government
agencies
to
develop
a
comprehensive
policy
on
encryption
that
accommodates
the
privacy
of
our
citizens
including
the
need
to
employ
voice
or
data
encryption
for
business
purposes
again
personal
use
seems
to
be
a
unaskable
question
the
ability
of
authorized
officials
to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under
proper
court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our
citizens
ah
so
warrents
are
not
always
needed
it
seems
the
effective
and
timely
use
of
the
most
modern
technology
to
build
the
national
information
infrastructure
needed
to
promote
economic
growth
and
the
competitiveness
of
american
industry
in
the
global
marketplace
and
the
need
of
us
companies
to
manufacture
and
export
high
technology
products
the
itars
seem
to
slightly
impeed
this
the
president
has
directed
early
and
frequent
consultations
with
affected
industries
the
congress
and
groups
that
advocate
the
privacy
rights
of
individuals
as
policy
options
are
developed
the
administration
is
committed
to
working
with
the
private
sector
to
spur
the
development
of
a
national
information
infrastructure
which
will
use
new
telecommunications
and
computer
technologies
to
give
americans
unprecedented
access
to
information
this
infrastructure
of
highspeed
networks
information
superhighways
will
transmit
video
images
hdtv
programming
and
huge
data
files
as
easily
as
todays
telephone
system
transmits
voice
note
that
all
this
wonderfull
stuff
will
be
in
secret
only
the
proper
people
will
be
able
to
express
an
opinion
hence
only
the
desired
result
will
emerge
since
encryption
technology
will
play
an
increasingly
important
role
in
that
infrastructure
the
federal
government
must
act
quickly
to
develop
consistent
comprehensive
policies
regarding
its
use
the
administration
is
committed
to
policies
that
protect
all
americans
right
to
privacy
while
also
protecting
them
from
those
who
break
the
law
encryption
and
codes
have
been
around
for
millenia
they
are
generaly
in
equilibrium
with
the
technology
of
the
time
the
systematic
study
of
cyphers
has
resulted
in
a
swing
in
favor
of
the
encrypter
at
the
moment
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
factoring
problem
will
fall
in
time
probably
fofr
practical
purposes
by
the
middle
of
the
next
century
further
information
is
provided
in
an
accompanying

sheet
the
provisions
of

telecommunications
initiative
q
does
this
approach
expand
the
authority
of
government
agencies
to
listen
in
on

conversations
a
no
clipper
chip
technology
provides
law
enforcement
with
no
new
authorities
to
access
the
content
of
the
private
conversations
of
americans
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
q
who
will
run
the
keyescrow
data
banks
a
the
two
keyescrow
data
banks
will
be
run
by
two
independent
entities
at
this
point
the
department
of
justice
and
the
administration
have
yet
to
determine
which
agencies
will
oversee
the
keyescrow
data
banks
it
is
a
little
hard
to
critisise
a
nonproposal
q
how
strong
is
the
security
in
the
device
how
can
i
be
sure
how
strong
the
security
is
a
this
system
is
more
secure
than
many
other
voice
encryption
systems
readily
available
today
note
we
drop
back
to
phonemode
again
if
this
is
a
true
answer
it
can
be
rephrased
as
it
sucks
big
time
anyone
who
can
drive
the
crypt
workbench
will
use
it
for
light
amusement
before
breakfast
while
the
algorithm
will
remain
classified
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
this
link
between
the
security
of
the
keyeschrow
and
the
actual
algorithm
is
a
real
winner
given
that
i
have
secret
bit
numbers
could
someone
please
explain
how
the
details
of
an
encryption
algorithm
will
reveal
them
we
are
willing
to
invite
an
independent
panel
of
cryptography
experts
to
evaluate
the
algorithm
to
assure
all
potential
users
that
there
are
no
unrecognized
vulnerabilities
just
make
sure
you
read
the
cvs
real
carfully
ok
q
whose
decision
was
it
to
propose
this
product
a
the
national
security
council
the
justice
department
the
commerce
department
and
other
key
agencies
were
involved
in
this
decision
this
approach
has
been
endorsed
by
the
president
the
vice
president
and
appropriate
cabinet
officials
quick
with
out
looking
back
what
name
is
missing
from
that
list
q
who
was
consulted
the
congress
industry
a
we
have
ongoing
discussions
with
congress
and
industry
on
encryption
issues
and
expect
those
discussions
to
intensify
as
we
carry
out
our
review
of
encryption
policy
we
have
briefed
members
of
congress
and
industry
leaders
on
the
decisions
related
to
this
initiative
the
people
who
agree
with
us
and
who
think
there
is
a
buck
in
it
for
them
q
will
the
government
provide
the
hardware
to
manufacturers
a
the
government
designed
and
developed
the
key
access
encryption
microcircuits
but
it
is
not
providing
the
microcircuits
to
product
manufacturers
product
manufacturers
can
acquire
the
microcircuits
from
the
chip
manufacturer
that
produces
them
the
reverse
engineering
provisions
of
the
maskwork
act
could
be
relevent
here
q
who
provides
the
clipper
chip
a
mykotronx
programs
it
at
their
facility
in
torrance
california
and
will
sell
the
chip
to
encryption
device
manufacturers
the
programming
function
could
be
licensed
to
other
vendors
in
the
future
q
how
do
i
buy
one
of
these
encryption
devices
a
we
expect
several
manufacturers
to
consider
incorporating
the
clipper
chip
into
their
devices
you
dont
not
unless
you
are
one
of
the
right
people
q
if
the
administration
were
unable
to
find
a
technological
solution
like
the
one
proposed
would
the
administration
be
willing
to
use
legal
remedies
to
restrict
access
to
more
powerful
encryption
devices
a
this
is
a
fundamental
policy
question
which
will
be
considered
during
the
broad
policy
review
the
key
escrow
they
missed
the
word
secret
here
he
needs
a
grammar
lesson
too
mechanism
will
provide
americans
with
an
encryption
product
that
is
more
secure
more
convenient
and
less
expensive
than
others
readily
available
today
but
it
is
just
one
piece
of
what
must
be
the
comprehensive
approach
to
encryption
technology
which
the
administration
is
developing
i
would
say
less
secure
less
conveniant
more
expensive
pgp
is
free
less
available
and
more
prone
to
being
comprimised
proofs
to
the
contarary
will
be
welcome
note
proof
the
administration
is
not
saying
since
encryption
threatens
the
public
safety
and
effective
law
enforcement
we
will
prohibit
it
outright
as
some
countries
have
effectively
done
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
they
dont
seem
to
be
saying
anything
that
makes
much
sense
and
this
proposal
does
prohibit
it
except
in
a
very
limited
way
and
this
is
the
one
explicit
reference
to
personal
rights
it
is
a
denial
and
yes
i
dont
think
that
the
mexicans
brazilians
and
canucks
are
included
in
clinton
et
als
magnanamous
gesture
there
is
a
false
tension
created
in
the
assessment
that
this
issue
is
an
eitheror
proposition
rather
both
concerns
can
be
and
in
fact
are
harmoniously
balanced
through
a
reasoned
balanced
approach
such
as
is
proposed
with
the
clipper
chip
and
similar
encryption
techniques
the
false
tension
is
false
the
balance
is
between
two
repugnant
points
the
right
to
privacy
is
handwaved
to
nonexistance
by
putting
it
behind
the
false
assessment
it
is
assumed
that
the
removal
of
the
right
to
take
what
ever
steps
you
deem
suitable
to
protect
your
privacy
is
non
negotiable
hence
is
defined
in
the
govenment
language
to
be
nonexistant
if
you
dont
agree
you
must
be
a
criminal
as
only
criminals
dont
agree
with
out
laws
also
note
the
non
question
if
what
is
here
was
not
possible
q
what
does
this
decision
indicate
about
how
the
clinton
administrations
policy
toward
encryption
will
differ
from
that
of
the
bush
administration
a
it
indicates
that
we
understand
the
importance
of
encryption
technology
in
telecommunications
and
computing
and
are
committed
to
working
with
industry
and
publicinterest
groups
to
find
innovative
ways
to
protect
americans
privacy
help
businesses
to
compete
and
ensure
that
law
enforcement
agencies
have
the
tools
they
need
to
fight
crime
and
terrorism
it
indicates
we
know
that
bush
dropped
the
ball
in
squashing
that
nasty
insert
suitable
retoric
and
will
stamp
out
this
disorderly
unruley
outbreak
of
freedom
and
ultranational
sentiment
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
casebycase
review
for
each
export
is
required
to
ensure
appropriate
use
of
these
devices
the
same
is
true
for
other
encryption
devices
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
we
plan
to
review
the
possibility
of
permitting
wider
exportability
of
these
products
this
one
is
a
real
giggle
in
australia
or
france
they
will
have
to
reveal
the
keys
and
the
algorithm
dont
think
its
at
the
top
of
my
list
of
things
i
must
have
so
the
restrictions
will
protect
me
from
saleks
trying
to
sell
me
a
bill
of
crock
any
for
any
others
using
it
they
must
be
nuts
good
luck
folks
paul
subject
re
more
technical
details
the
system
or
family
key
would
appear
to
be
cryptographically
useless
since
every
chip
must
know
it
and
be
able
to
remove
its
effects
from
the
bitstream
i
daresay
that
it
will
be
widely
known
almost
immediately
after
this
system
is
deployed
and
since
its
been
pointed
out
that
there
is
not
a
separate
decrypt
key
the
same
key
is
used
for
both
encryption
and
decryption
there
goes
any
benefit
to
the
use
of
a
systemwide
key
in
skipjack
robert

i
recognize
that

taken
to
calling
themselves

but
i
consider
them
irrelevant

i

really

im

i

how

does
it
cost
of
course
if
we
didnt

there
probably

how
can
you
reconcile
the

self

purpose
of
providing
law
enforcement
with
access
to
encrypted
data
without
making
the
clipper
system
the
only
crypto
available
in
the
us
the
second

amendments
do
come
to

the
second

is
especially
apt
given
the

of

and
the

peoples
increasing

tripledes

wish

they
wouldnt
there

what
follows
is
my
opinion
it
is
not

to
be
the
truth
so
no
flames
please
it
comes
out
of
a
background
of
years
as
a
senior
corporate
staff
executive
in
two
fortune
companies
no
wonder
american
businesses
are
going
down
the
tubes
id
be
happy
to
use
a
crypto
system
supplied
by
the
nsa
for
business
if
they
told
me
it
was
more
secure
than
des
and
in
particular
resistant
to
attempts
by
japanese
french
and
other
competitive
companies
and
governments
to
break
its
nist
not
nsa
nsa
is
not
supposed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
they
didnt
say
that
they
said
is
was
better
than
some
commercialgrade
encryptions
i
for
one
wouldnt
trust
them
if
they
did
unless
they
release
the
algorithm
for
investigation
id
be
happy
to
do
so
even
with
escrowed
keys
provided
i
was
happy
about
the
bona
fides
of
the
escrow
agencies
the
federal
reserve
would
certainly
satisfy
me
as
would
something
set
up
by
one
of
the
big
accounting
firms
maybe
the
aclu
and
eff
it
would
have
to
be
a
nonprofit
so
the
big
would
be
out
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
president
if
they
stated
there
were
no
trap
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committee
of
independent
experts
examined
the
thing
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
reported
back
that
it
was
secure
i
wouldnt
trust
the
nsa
i
think
i
would
trust
the
president
on
this
but
im
not
certain
he
would
be
told
id
trust
something
from
the

long
before
id
trust
something
from
some

anybody
japanese
thats

this
may
seem
surprising
to
some
here
but
i

most

would

i
have
a
question
that
is
a
slight
variation
on
the
previously
mentioned
examples
that
perhaps
people
could
give
me
some
pointers
on
it
has
been
a
couple
of
years
since
my
con
law
class
in
college
so
i
hope
i
am
not
missing
something
obvious
here
basic
scenario
i
set
up
a
bbs
that
uses
publickey
encryption
and
encryption
of
files
on
disk
the
general
setup
is
designed
so
that
when
users
connect
they
send
a
private
key
encrypted
using
the
system
public
key
and
the
users
publicprivate
keypair
is
used
to
wrap
the
onetime
session
keys
used
for
encrypting
the
files
on
disk
the
result
of
this
is
that
even
if
i
reveal
the
system
private
key
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
gain
access
to
the
files
stored
on
the
machine
what
is
possible
is
for
someone
to
use
the
revealed
system
private
key
to
entice
users
into
revealing
thier
personal
private
keys
during
the
authentication
sequence
questions
does
the
fact
that
the
system
private
key
does
not
provide
any
information
useful
for
a
search
give
me
any
protection
as
far
as
being
coerced
to
reveal
the
key
i
doubt
it
myself
it
seems
providing
the
system
private
key
does
not
mean
that
i
am
assisting
in
entrapment
the
users
would
send
thier
key
anyway
and
are
not
being
enticed
into
doing
something
they
would
not
otherwise
do
but
is
there
any
other
hook
that
can
be
used
would
the
user
privatekey
enticement
require
wiretap
approval
any
answers
or
general
musings
on
the
subject
would

diffyhellman
etc
is

m

used

this
three

message
consists

em
k
k
encrypted
with
some
other
key
and
the

serial
number
this
three
part
message
is
then
encrypted
by
still
another
key
my
question
is
what
is
a
message
for
example
say
we
are
dealing
with
an
encrypted
digitized
voice
application
the
speech
waveform
is
sampled
and
digitized
and
then
some
number
of
samples
are
grouped
into
a
bit
block
this
block
is
then
encrypted
and
transmitted
over
a
nonsecure
communications
link
where
is
the
three
part
message
is
something
appended
to
each
bit
block
is
a
header
sent
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
if
the
header
is
sent
at
the
beginning
of
the
session
how
do
they
insure
the
equipment
manufacturer
using
the
chip
does
just
that
can
just
anyone
manufacture
products
using
the

you

after
all
we
need
this

from

can
you
while

give
us
one

reason
that

be
a

unless
this

either
is
a
joke
or
contains
features
like
a
master
key
or
other
back
door
for
unauthorized
eavesdropping
if
it
was
really
even
moderately
secure
and
the

really
meant
to
require
the
proper
court
order
and
the
keys
that
are
in
the

to
be
able
to
decipher
the

what
is
the
need
to
keep
the
algorithm
secret
seems
i
hear
rather
often
that
if
an
encryption
scheme
requires
the
algorithm
to
remain
a
secret
to
be
effective
it
is
not
a
worthwhile
scheme
is
this
just
idle
talk

is
the

bullshitting
everyone

me
as
for
its

well
first
of
all
you
can
get
a
cryptophone
from
companies
like
cylink
today
and
they
work
well
in
addition
a
number
of
groups
are
now
working
on
building
software
to
turn
any
pc
into
a
privacy
enhanced
phone
right
now
and
they
are
all
working
in
overdrive
mode
and
yes
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto
restrictions
lifted
but
this
is
at
least
an
incrememental
improvement
for
certain
applications
there
are
no
crypto
restrictions
yet
you
can
use
anything
you
want
right
now
the
point
is
to
maintain
that
right
the
point
you
all
seem
to
have
missed
was
covered
when
the
uk
cellphone
scrambling
system
was
discussed
incidentally
my
mp
has
responded
to
my
questions
on
that
issue
and
it
appears
that
the
uk
and
other
approved
countries
will
get
the
secure
encryption
and
dodgy
countries
will
get
existing
mobile
equipment
will
drop
to
clear
mode
when
used
with
systems
but
newer
equipment
will
use
depending
on
the
capabilities
of
the
base
station
the
copsfeds
do
not
need
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
your
private
key
to
listen
in
to
cellular
conversations
encryption
is
not
endtoend
but
cellphone
to
basestation
it
has
to
be
this
way
so
that
cellular
users
and
fixed
installations
can
talk
to
each
other
for
cellular
to
cellular
calls
the
transmission
is
decrypted
at
the
basestation
passed
to
another
basestation
and
reencrypted
the
copsfeds
can
listen
to
the
unscrambled
call
provided
they
get
a
warrant
to
tap
into
the
cellular
providers
equipment
the
only
reason
for
wanting
a
crackable
system
is
so
they
can
listen
without
having
to
obtain
a
warrant
but
maybe
the
clipper
system
is
secure
and
they
really
do
need
a
warrant
to
get
the
key
out
of
escrow
before
they
can
listen
in
using
a
scanner
see
above
they
dont
have
to
go
down
this
route
anyway
i
have
my
doubts
but
even
if
true
once
they
have
the
key
they
will
never
again
need
a
warrant
to
tap
into
that
particular
phone
whenever
they
want
well
judge
it
appears
he
wasnt

i

that

since
once

the

much

and
will

i
expect
that
someone
will
come
along
with
a
pin

that
uses
secure
encryption
possibly
even
disguised
so
that
its
not
possible
to
tell
it
from
the

until
you
try
to
use

if
i
were
to
manufacture
such
a

as

of
my
marketing
strategy
i
would
try
to
subvert
one
or
both

either
through
bribes

industrial
espionage
and
then
publicize
the
fact
doing

not

which
would
likely
not
be
legal
publicly
discrediting
the

would
go
quite
far
towards
creating
a
market
for
a
secure
alternative
i
also
believe
that
someone
will
reverse
engineer
the
clipper
chip
and
knowlege
of
the
algorithm
will
likely
be
fairly
widespread
any
back
doors
or
weaknesses
would
further
discredit
the
scheme
and
help
grow
the
market
demand
for
a
secure
alternative
i
believe
that
the
company
that
provides
such
an
alternative
will
make
few
friends
in

lots
of
money
i
also
believe

illegal
i
expect

will
see

a
technical
summary
the
following
document
summarizes
the
clipper
chip
how
it
is
used
how
programming
of
the
chip
is
coupled
to
key
generation
and
the
escrow
process
and
how
law
enforcement
decrypts
communications
since
there
has
been
some
speculation
on
this
news
group
about
my
own
involvement
in
this
project
id
like
to
add
that
i
was
not
in
any
way
involved
i
found
out
about
it
when
the
fbi
briefed
me
on
thursday
evening
april
since
then
i
have
spent
considerable
time
talking
with
the
nsa
and
fbi
to
learn
more
about
this
and
i
attended
the
nist
briefing
at
the
department
of
commerce
on
april
the
document
below
is
the
result
of
that

introduction
on
april
the
president
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
together
the
federal
government
and
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
provide
secure
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
at
the
heart
of
the
plan
is
a
new
tamperproof
encryption
chip
called
the
clipper
chip
together
with
a
splitkey
approach
to
escrowing
keys
two
escrow
agencies
are
used
and
the
key
parts
from
both
are
needed
to
reconstruct
a
key
chip
structure
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
throughput
is
mbits
a
second
each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages
encrypted
with
the
chip
encrypting
with
the
chip
to
see
how
the
chip
is
used
imagine
that
it
is
embedded
in
the
att
telephone
security
device
as
it
will
be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
a
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
the
key
k
and
message
stream
m
ie
digitized
voice
are
then
fed
into
the
clipper
chip
to
produce
two
values
em
k
the
encrypted
message
stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a
law
enforcement
block
the
law
enforcement
block
thus
contains
the
session
key
k
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
u
concatenated
with
the
serial
number
n
all
encrypted
under
the
family
key
f
chip
programming
and
escrow
all
clipper
chips
are
programmed
inside
a
scif
secure
computer
information
facility
which
is
essentially
a
vault
the
scif
contains
a
laptop
computer
and
equipment
to
program
the
chips
about
chips
are
programmed
during
a
single
session
the
scif
is
located
at
mikotronx
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
an
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
an
value
these
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial
numbers
to
generate
the
unit
key
for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce
and
and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to
and
the
second
bits
to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit
key
u
is
the
xor
of
and
and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
as
a
sequence
of
values
for
and
u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial
number
that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second
disk
is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third
disk
contains
the
unit
keys
u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second
disk
the
third
disk
is
used
to
program
the
chips
after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the
vault
and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
the
protocol
may
be
changed
slightly
so
that
four
people
are
in
the
room
instead
of
two
the
first
two
would
provide
the
seeds
and
and
the
second
two
the
escrow
agents
would
take
the
disks
back
to
the
escrow
agencies
the
escrow
agencies
have
as
yet
to
be
determined
but
they
will
not
be
the
nsa
cia
fbi
or
any
other
law
enforcement
agency
one
or
both
may
be
independent
from
the
government
law
enforcement
use
when
law
enforcement
has
been
authorized
to
tap
an
encrypted
line
they
will
first
take
the
warrant
to
the
service
provider
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
communications
line
let
us
assume
that
the
tap
is
in
place
and
that
they
have
determined
that
the
line
is
encrypted
with
clipper
they
will
first
decrypt
the
law
enforcement
block
with
the
family
key
f
this
gives
them
ek
u
n
they
will
then
take
a
warrant
identifying
the
chip
serial
number
n
to
each
of
the
key
escrow
agents
and
get
back
and
and
are
xored
together
to
produce
the
unit
key
u
and
ek
u
is
decrypted
to
get
the
session
key
k
finally
the
message
stream
is
decrypted
all
this
will
be
accomplished
through
a
special
black
box
decoder
operated
by
the
fbi
acknowledgment
and
distribution
notice
all

is
based
on
information
provided
by

and
the
fbi
permission
to
distribute
this
document
is
granted
subject
clipper
and
ranting
libertarians
i
would
think
that
you
could
reduce
the
defense
of
using
nonclipper
based
encryption
technologies
to
defending
freedom
of
expression
ie
free
speech
that
you
have
to
right
to
express
whatever
you
want
in
whatever
form
your
little
heart
desires
so
long
as
you
do
not
impinge
on
the
rights
of
others
encrypted
textsoundvideo
is
just
another
form
of
expression
of
that
particular
textsoundvideo
just
like
digitized
sound
is
another
means
of
expression
of
sound
streams
of
instead
of
continuous
waveforms
also
it
shouldnt
be
up
to
the
government
at
all
encryption
standards
can
be
decided
upon
by
independent
standards
orgainizations
apologies
for
the
acronym
one
can
note
how
well
this
has
worked
with
iso
and
the
metric
system
sae
etc
independent
entities
or
consortia
of
peopleindustries
in
that
particular
area
are
far
more
qualified
to
set
standards
than
any
one
government
agency
consider
for
example
what
the
ascii
character
set
would
have
looked
like
if
it
was
decided
by
the
government
i
hope
this
helps
folks
to
formulate
their
defenses
im
still
working
on
mine
and
hope
to
be
faxing

for

public

subject
would
clipper
make
a
good
cover
for
other
encryption
method
clipper
might
be
a
good
way
to
cover
the
use
of
another
layer
of
encryption
currently
when
you
send
an
encrypted
message
an
opponent
can
usually
tell
that
you
are
using
encryption
which
encryption
method
you
are
using
because
that
information
is
usually
in
the
clear
with
clipper
most
opponents
will
only
know
that
you
are
sending
clippertext
they
wont
know
that
your
clippertext
is
itself
encoded
only
those
few
opponents
who
get
your
clipperkeys
will
know
that
your
message
is
double
encrypted
kind
of
like
a
safety
deposit
box
containing
a
lock
box
so
dont
just
think
of
replacements
for
clipper
also
think
of

their
strategy
is
a
business
one
rather
than
legal
one
they
are
pushing
to
get
a
standard
in
place
a
secret
standard
and
if
they
get
it
as
a
standard
then
they
will
drive
competitors
out
of
the
market
it
will
be
legal
to
sell
better
untapable
encryption
that
doesnt
have
registered
keys
but
it
will
be
difficult
and
thus
not
a
plan
for
most
phone
companies
if
brads
analysis
is
correct
it
may
offer
an
explanation
for
why
the
encryption
algorithm
is
being
kept
secret
this
will
prevent
competitors
from
coming
out
with
clippercompatible
phones
which
lack
the
government
installed
back
door
the
strategy
brad
describes
will
only
work
as
long
as
the
only
way
to
get
compatible
phones
is
to
have
ones
with
the
government
chips
it
would
be
nice
from
the
point
of
view
of
personal
privacy
if
brad
turns
out
to
be
right
as
long
as
people
still
have
the
power
to
provide
their
own
encryption
in
place
of
or
in
addition
to
the
clipper
privacy
is
still
possible
but
the
wording
of
several
passages
in
the
announcement
makes
me
doubt
whether
this
will
turn
out
to
be
true
even
if
what
brad
says
turns
out
to
be
accurate
you
can
bet
that
the
administration
will
have
made
it
very
clear
to
the
vendors
that
it
would
very
much
be
in
their
best
interests
to
institute
a
voluntary
policy
of
refusing
to
sell
anything
but
clinton
cripple
equipped
equipment
to
anyone
other
than
authorized
government
agencies
and
law
enforcement
or
individuals
and
corporations
who
have
been
been
determined
by
the
administration
to
have
a
valid
need
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
an
effective
system
note
that
this
is
very
much
like
the
language
used
in
many
gun
control
billslaws
the
administration
is
pushing
for
or
otherwise
supporting
the
logic
and
actual
rationale
as
opposed
to
the
excuses
that
get
fed
to
the
media
is
the
same
in
both
cases
only
the
items
or
technology
in
question
are
different
i
think
this
is
no
accident
it
comes
from
the
same
philosophy
that
the
government
rulescontrols
the
people
not
the
people
controlling
the
government
that
the
unconnected
citizens
are
not
sophisticated
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
them
so
the
government
must
tell
the
people
what
they
need
or
do
not
need
we
know
best
and
the
idea
that
that
a
commoner
can
defend
himself
against
government
eavesdropping
or
unlawful
attack
is
totally
unacceptable
to
people
with
this
outlook
hal
finney
combine
this
all
with
pushing
for
national
identity
cards
with
smart
chips
to
encode
anything
they
please
internal
passport
under
the
guise
of
streamlining
the
state
peoples
health
care
system
and
with
you
can
be
certain
more
jewels
yet
to
come
and
one
sees
an
extremely
ominous
trend
so
what
if
will
be
ten
years
late
it
still
is
turning
out
to
be
an
amazingly
accurate
prophecy
unless
a
lot
of
people
wake
up
and
in
a
hurry
one
should
always
have
every
red
warning
light
and
bell
and
danger
flag
come
up
when
the
government
seeks
to
set
itself
apart
in
regard
to
rights
etc
from
the
unconnectedunprivileged
citizen
or
should
we
now
be
saying
subject
instead
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
have
a
good
secure
system
of
data
security
not
dependent
on
nebulous
safeguards
for
maintaining
that
security
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
be
able
to
defend
himself
from
an
agency
gone
rogue
am
sure
the
feds
could
break
into
any
data
they
really
wanted
to
but
it
would
take
some
work
and
using
the
same
logic
one
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
good
safe
unless
a
duplicate
of
the
keys
or
combination
are
submitted
for
safekeeping
by
the
government
i
dont
really
see
a
difference
philosophically

wont

then
k

my

that

not
encrypted
under

called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
will
also
check
it
out
but
this
is
sunday
so
i
did
not
want
to
wait
ok
so
there
are
in
fact
two
distinct
components
transmitted
by
the
chip
the
real
message
encrypted
with
the
conventional
key
and
the
serial
number
and
encrypted
conventional
key
encrypted
with
the
imho
kind
of
bogus
as
the
whole
concept
of
one
key
that
millions
of
people
use
which
cant
be
changed
doesnt
seem
reasonable
family
key
suppose
i
analyze
the
output
of
this
chip
and
im
able
to
determine
which
bits
are
the
encrypted
packet
which
contains
the
serial
number
and
session
key
suppose
i
also
design
a
simple
algorithm
based
on
this
information
which
takes
the
data
containing
the
encrypted
session
key
and
twiddles
a
bit
or
several
before
its
sent
down
the
line
mind
you
im
sure
the
nsa
thought
of
this
along
with
a
dozen
other
attacks
i
cant
imagine
and
the
system
is
probably
somehow
designed
so
that
manipulation
of
this
information
will
cause
a
compliant
receiving
chip
to
somehow
fail
to
decrypt
successfully
but
how
what
if
the
two
parties
agree
in
advance
on
some
kind
of
consistent
bittwiddling
scheme
so
the
decryption
chip
sees
the
restored
proper
bitstream
but
an
eavesdropper
gets
a
ek
uk
packet
thats
wrong
i
suppose
this
could
be
easily
defeated
if
the
chip
sends
that
information
out
many
times
in
slightly
different
ways
making
it
effectively
impossible
to
be
certain
you
know
all
the
information
being
sent

the
escrow
database
here
is
a
disturbing
thought
now
we
no
longer
live
in
the
days
of
big
filing
cabinets
we
live
in
the
electronic
age
i
asked
myself
how
big
could
the
escrow
database
get
how
hard
might
it
be
to
steal
the
whole
thing
particularly
were
i
an
nsa
official
operating
with
the
tacit
permission
of
the
escrow
houses
we
can
pretend
that
such
will
not
happen
but
thats
naive
well
lets
see
ten
bytes
of
each
escrow
half
lets
asume
ten
bytes
of
serial
number
in
fact
i
believe
the
serial
number
is
smaller
but
this
is
an
order
of
magnitude
calculation
we
assume
as
the
population
and
that
each
person
has
a
key
i
get
five
gigabytes
for
each
of
the
two
escrow
databases
fits
conveniently
on
a
single
very
valuable
exabyte
tape
this
can
only
get
easier
with
time
but
who
cares
i
can
already
hold
all
the
clipper
keys
in
the
country
in
my
pocket
on
two
tapes
admittely
they
will
think
of
safeguards
they
wont
put
the
whole
database
on
one
disk
prehaps
maybe
they
will
throw
stumbling
blocks
in
the
way
this
changes
nothing
they
keys
will
be
needed
every
day
by
hundreds
if
not
thousands
of
law
enforcement
types
so
convenience
will
dictate
that
the
system
permit
quick
electronic
retrieval
at
some
point
with
or
without
collusion
by
the
agencies
those
exabyte
tapes
are
going
to
get
cut
dorothy
denning
and
david
sternlight
will
doubtless
claim
this
cant
happen
but
we
know
that
cant
is
a
prayer
not
a
word
that
in
this
instance
connotes
realism
with
two
exabyte
tapes
in
your
pocket
you
would
hold
the
keys
for
every
persons
conversations
in
the
country
in
your
hands
yeah
you
need
the
master
key
two
but
thats
just
ten
bytes
of
information
that
have
to
be
stored
an
awful
lot
of
places
come
to
think
of
it
even
if
the
nsa
getting
a
copy
of
the
database
isnt
a
threat
to
you
because
unlike
me
you
have
no
contraversial
political
views
consider
foreign
intelligence
services
you
know
the
ones
that
david
sternlight
wants
to
protect
us
from
because
of
the
evil
industrial
espionage
that
they
do
the
french
apparently
do
have
a
big
spying
operation
in
friendly
countries
to
get
industrial
secrets
so
he
isnt
being
completely
irrational
here
although
why
our
companies
couldnt
use
cryptosystems
without
back
doors
is
left
unexplained
by
those
that
point
out
this
threat
presumably
foreign
intelligence
services
can
get
moles
into
the
nsa
and
other
agencies
we
have
proof
by
example
of
this
its
happened
many
times
presumably
someday
they
will
get
their
hands
on
some
fraction
of
the
keys
you
cant
avoid
that
sort
of
thing
dont
pretend
that
no
one
unauthorized
will
ever
get
their
hands
on
the
escrow
databases
we
crypto
types
are
all
taught
something
very
important
at
the
beginning
of
intro
to
cryptography
security
must
depend
on
the
easily
changed
key
that
you
pick
to
run
your
system
and
not
on
a
secret
the
escrow
databases
arent
the
sorts
of
secrets
that
our
teachers
told
us
about
but
they
are
the
sort
of
big
secrets
they
would
lump
into
this
category
imagine
trying
to
replace
million
clipper
chips
i
cannot
believe
that
the
nsa
or
whomever
it
is
thats
doing
this
doesnt
realize
all
this
already
they
are
too
smart
there
are
too
many
of
them
who
have
made
their
bones
in
the
real
world
i
suspect
that
they
know
precisely
what
they
are
doing
and
that
what
they
are
doing
is
giving
us
the
appearance
of
safety
so
that
they
can
continue
to
surveil
in
spite
of
the
growth
of
strong
cryptography
i
suspect
that
they
realize
that
they
cant
put
things
off
forever
but
they
can
try
to
delay
things
as
long
as
possible
who
knows
maybe
even
some
of
the
higher
ups
the
inevitable
bureaucratic
types
that
rise
in
any
organization
really
do
believe
that

writes
and
since
the

constitutions
guarantees
the
right
to
every
american
to
bear
arms
why
is
not
every
american
entitled
as
a
matter
of
have
you
read
the
applicable
part
of
the
constitution
and
interpreted
it
in
context
if
not
please
do
so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individuals
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
the
supreme
court
seems
to
disagree
with
you
they
have
stated
that
the
people
is
a
term
of
art
refering
to
an
individual
right
and
have
explicitly
mentioned
the
second
amendment
as
an
example
i
quote
the
people
seems
to
have
been
a
term
of
art
employed
in
select
parts
of
the
constitution
the
preamble
declares
that
the
constitution
is
ordained
and
established
by
the
people
of
the
the
us
the
second
amendment
protects
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
supreme
court
of
the
us
us
v
uerdugouriquidez
furthermore
in
the
miller
decision
they
only
permitted
prosecution
for
possession
of
a
sawedoff
shotgun
because
the
defense
had
not
presented
testimony
and
they
therefore
accepted
the
argument
of
the
government
that
such
weapons
have
no
military
value
they
held
that
the
amendment
protected
the
individual
right
to
possess
military
weapons
unfortunately
no
second
amendment
case
has
successfully
gotten
to
the
court
in
fifty
years
however
that
does
not
change
the
interpretation
furthermore
it
appears
that
others
disagree
with
you
as
well
vis
the
conclusion
is
thus
inescapable
that
the
history
concept
and
wording
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
well
as
its
interpretation
by
every
major
commentator
and
court
in
the
first
halfcentury
after
its
ratifi
cation
indicates
that
what
is
protected
is
an
individual
right
of
a
private
citizen
to
own

carry
firearms

second
session
february
you
might
rightfully
ask
well
then
what
does
that
first
bit
about
militias
mean
well
militia
in
historical
context
basically
means
the
whole
of
the
adult
males
of
the
country
indeed
the
us
code
still
defines
militia
as
all
armed
men
over
the
age
of
the
militia
comprised
all
males
physically
capable
of
acting
in
concert
for
the
common
defense
and
these
men
were
expected
to
appear
bearing
arms

by
themselves
and
of
the
kind
in
common
use
at
the
time
supreme
court
of
the
united

us
v
miller
the
reason
for
the
phrase
being
there
was
to
explain
the
rationale
behind
the
amendment
which
was
this
by
depending
on
the
people
to
bear
arms
in
defense
of
the
country
no
centralization
of
military
power
could
ever
occur
which
would
permit
tyranny
in
short
the

would
remain
perpetually
in
fear
of
the
people
rather
than
the
other
way
around
no
free
man
shall
ever
be
debarred
the
use
of
arms
the
strongest
reason
for
the
people
to
retain
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
as
a
last
resort

to

encryption
is
not
endtoend

cellphone

it
has
to
be
this
way
so
that
cellular

fixed

can
talk
to
each

the

is
decrypted

the

can
listen
to
the

provided
they
get
a

to

the
only
reason
for
wanting
a
crackable

is
so
they
can
listen
without
having
to
obtain

maybe
the

they
really
do
need
a

to

they

they
dont

i
have
my

even

they

they

never

find
it
disturbing
that
at
the
very
best
my

is
dependant
on
approximately
bytes
worth
of
information
that
could
be
written

even

the
rationale
behind
this

seems
strange
if
one
is
assuming
that
the
goal
is

makes
perfect

if
the

is
an

of

we
are

that
this
cannot
happen
but
no
one
understands
how
skipjack
works
outside
of
government
officials
and
soon
foreign
intelligence
services
that
gain
the
information
via
espionage
presumably
we
will
eventually
have
the
information
as
well
reverse
engineering
gets
more
and
more
advanced
every
year
but
by
the
time
we
know
it
may
be
too
late
as
a
sequence
of
values
for

u
are

they
are
written

three
separate

the

the

the

u

the

the

is
used
to

after

are
programmed
all

is
discarded
from

the

leave
the

be

for
additional
assurance
that
no

none
of
this
makes
me
feel
the

secure
the
silly
notion

to
be

why
there
is
a
need

in

place
other
than
to

we

the

would
resist
a
million

a

its
probably
worth

so
you
can

so
that

can
you
while
my
mind
is
on
it
give
us
one
good
reason
that
the
algorithm
should
be
a
secret
algorithm
unless
this
encryption
scheme
either
is
a
joke
or
contains
features
like
a
master
key
or
other
back
door
for
unauthorized
eavesdropping
hmm
here
are
a
couple
if
the
algorithm
becomes
known
it
will
be
easy
to
produce
pincompatible
noncrippled
chips
that
provide
real
encryption
and
privacy
because
their
keys
are
only
in
their
users
hands
since
skipjack
is
a
symmetric
key
cypher
it
needs
some
way
to
agree
on
a
session
key
the
released
information
says
that
any
protocol
may
be
used
eg
dh
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
this
is
probably
true
however
from
a
practical
point
of
view
those
chips
must
have
some
kind
of
key
exchange
protocol
builtin
what
if
it
is
good
old

this
will
mean
that
the

will
have

to

on

if

i
guessed
this
would
be
a
basic
condition
for
such

i
did
run
a
bbs
some
time
ago
but
that
was
in
switzerland
the
us
doesnt
yet
have
many
laws
covering
bbss
theyre
not
common
carriers
theyre
not
phone
companies
theyre
just
private
machines
or
services
operated
by
businesses
theres
no
obligation
to
keep
records
as
perry
metzger
points
out
if
the
police
come
with
a
search
warrant
you
have
to
let
them
see
what
the
warrant
demands
if
it
exists
and
they
generally
can
confiscate
the
equipment
as
evidence
which
is
not
constitutionally
valid
but
were
only
beginning
to
develop
court
cases
supporting
us
a
court
may
be
able
to
compel
you
to
tell
them
information
you
know
such
as
the
encryption
password
for
the
disk
there
arent
any
definitive
cases
yet
since
its
a
new
situation
and
there
probably
arent
laws
specifically
covering
it
but
the
court
cant
force
you
to
know
the
keys
and
there
are
no
laws
preventing
you
from
allowing
your
users
to
have
their
own
keys
for
their
own
files
without
giving
them
to
you
even
in
areas
that
do
have
established
law
there
is
uncertainty
there
was
a
guy
in
idaho
a
few
years
ago
who
had
his
business
records
subpoenaed
as
evidence
for
taxes
or
some
other
businessrestriction
law
so
he
gave
the
court
the
records
which
were
in
hebrew
the
us
doesnt
have
laws
forcing
you
to
keep
your
records
in
english
and
these
were
the
originals
of
the
records
he
didnt
speak
hebrew
and
neither
did
anybody
in
the
court
organization
dont
think
they
were
able
to
do
much
about
it
it
might
be
illegal
for
your
bbs
to
deny
access
to
potential
customers
based
on
race
religion
national
origin
gender
or
sexual
preference
it
probably
hasnt
been

in

from

horrible
from

why

rather

the

completely
obviates

more
interestingly
we
know
for
a
fact
that

are

no

what
the

is
no
more
than
why
not

at

why
this
interesting
restriction
of

if
it
not

i
find
it
disturbing
that
at
the

best
my

dependant
on
approximately
bytes
worth
of

that
could
be
written
on

even
if
and
change
periodically
the
rationale
behind
this
restriction
in
the
size
of
the
keyspace
seems
strange
if
one
is
assuming
that
the
goal
is
security
and
makes
perfect
sense
if
the
goal
is
an
illusion
of

wonder
if
they
can
somehow
be
backderived
given
enough

number
pairs
we
are
assured
that
this
cannot
happen
but
no
one
understands
how
skipjack
works
outside
of
government
officials
and
soon
foreign
intelligence
services
that
gain
the
information
via
espionage
presumably
we
will
eventually
have
the
information
as
well
reverse
engineering
gets
more
and
more
advanced
every
year
but
by
the
time
we
know
it
may
be
too
late
perhaps
the
trusted
escrow
agencies
can
be
the
ones
who
come
up
with
and
and
if
these
agencies
are
really
trusted
aclu
nra
is
an
interesting
example
we
can
hope
that
theyll
use
some
physical
process
to
come

super
secret
military

agency
had
actually
developed
the
encryption
technology
around
which
the

is
built
according

the
technical
specifications
and
the

establishing
the

are

the

with
key
agencies
including
nsa
nist
the
national
security
council
and
the

relating

the
cpsr
requests
are
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
the
computer

act
which
congress
passed
in
in
order
to
open
the
development
of
nonmilitary
computer
security
standards
to
public
scrutiny
and
to
limit
nsas
role
in
the
creation
of
such
standards

previously
has
questioned
the
role
of
nsa
in
developing
the
socalled

a
communications
authentication
technology
that

proposed

the

agency
disclosed
for
the

the

apparent
commitment
to
the
privacy
of

as
reflected
in
todays
official
statement
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
he
questioned
the
propriety
of
nsas
role
in
the
process
and
the
apparent
secrecy
that
has
thus
far
shielded
the
development
process
from
public
scrutiny
at
a
time
when
we
are
moving
towards
the
development
of
a
new
information
infrastructure
it
is
vital
that
standards
designed
to
protect
personal
privacy
be
established
openly
and
with
full
public
participation
it
is
not
appropriate
for
nsa
an
agency
with
a
long
tradition
of
secrecy
and
opposition
to
effective
civilian
cryptography
to
play
a
leading

spoofing
clipper
serial

secrecy
in

chip
the
serial
number
of
the
clipper
chip
is
encrypted

the

transmitted
as
one
part
of
a
three
part
message
presumably
the

can
be
recovered

nothing

differential
analysis
postulate
if
you
will
a
chip
or
logic
sitting
between
the
clipper
chip
and
its
communications
channel
the
purpose
of
this
chip
is
twofold
transmit
channel
the
spoof
chip
xors
the
bit
encrypted
serial
number
with
a
secondary
keying
variable
this
renders
the
serial

unrecoverable

just
the
system
key
recieve
channel
the
spoof
chip
xors
the
incoming
encrypted
serial
number
with
a
secondary
keying
variable
assuming
the
serial
number
is
necessary
for
local
operation
this
has
the
net
result
of
hiding
the
serial
number
this
gets
more
interesting
when
the
number
of
serial
numbers
issued
becomes
large
making
it
difficult
to
distinguish
between
valid
serial
numbers
and
a
spoofed
serial
number
without
knowing
the
system
key
you
could
lie
about
the
serial
number
but
risk
detection
of
the
lie
if
you
had
the
system
key
and
the
encryption
algorithm
you
could
successfully
lie
with
a
lower
probability
of
detection
by
emulating
the
format
of
your
own
serial
number
makes
you
wonder
whats
being
hidden
here

the
secrecy
is
to
prevent
you

i

that

interoperability

all

its

were

i

stopping

considered
harmful
if
clipper
comes
to
cellular
phones
along
with
legal
proscriptions
against
using
other
cipher
systems
on
these
phones
a
new
and
potentially
dangerous
class
of
crime
is
created
criminals
who
very
badly
want
inscrutable
tactical
communications
specifically
the
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
who
proponents
of
key
escrow
cite
as
threats
will
be
highly
motivated
to
steal
the
cipher
phone
of
a
legitimate
user
and
to
kill
this
person
or
hold
them
hostage
so
discovery
of
compromise
of
the
device
will
be
delayed
once
a
suitable
collection
of
devices
is
stolen
criminals
can
communicate
with
impunity
assuming
the
cipher
system
carries
no
trapdoors
apart
from
key
escrow
until
and
unless
the
compromise
is
discovered
by
some
other
means
because
lifeischeap
criminals
are
currently
willing
to
kill
people
to
steal
very
large
and
conspicuous
property
luxury
cars
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
they
will
be
willing
to
kill
people
to
steal
small
and
inconspicuous
property
a
cipher
cellular
phone
just
as
we
have
seen
in
the
past
with
blue
box
technology
and
in
the
present
with
modified
cellular
phones
we
can
expect
to
see
among
highstakes
criminals
a
lucrative
market
for
stolen
cipher
phones
which
can
be
used
for
a
few
days
the
highstakes
criminals
will
pay
the
lifeischeap
types
substantial
amounts
for
stolen
instruments
because
a
person
is
typically
discovered
as
missing
or
dead
in
a
few
days
a
stolen
instrument
will
be
usable
for
only
a
few
days
there
will
be
a
continuing
demand
for
fresh
phones
fresh
bodies
in
other
words
clipper
and
similar
systems
have
the
potential
to
turn
a
current
inconvenience
to
law
enforcement
into
a
direct
vicious
and
persistent
threat
to
the
general
public
on
the
other
hand
if
a
criminal
were
to
apply
some
arbitrary
cipher
to
a
device
in
a
mostly
nonciphered
network
the
communication
will
at
least
stand
out
as
being
unusual
and
perhaps
worthy
of
other
means
of
investigation
finally
because
there
is
essentially
no
possibility
of
intercepting
in
realtime
the
scrutable
content
of
communications
between
stolen
instruments
there
will
exist
strong
motivation
to
record
and
archive
all
communications
in
the
network
for
expostfacto
scrutiny
once
some
criminal
act
is
discovered
and
the
instruments
involved
have
been
identified
while
recording
and
archiving
may
not
be
feasible
for
wireline
networks
it
is
probably
feasible
across
the
more
limited
bandwidth
of
radio
networks
the
existence
of
these
recordings
could
open
up
vast
potential
for
abuse

from
marc

the
majority
of
the
discussion
involving
this
clipper
chip
seems
to
pertain
to
the
encryption
of
telephone
conversations
does
anyone
know
if
that
means
this
chip
is
designed
to
work
primarily
with
analog
signals
the
language
sort
of
suggests
this
but
its
hard
to
say
id
lay
a
few
bucks
that
its
just
dataindataout
in
parallel
i
suspect
to
make
it
a
phone
youd
need
a
codec
and
speech
compression
there
would
be
a
loss
of
bandwidth
on
the
speech
signal
which
i
suspect
would
scupper
any
of
the
suggestions
ive
seen
here
about
putting
a
different
encryption
front
end
on
it
theres
no
hint
of
any
modulation
scheme
in
the
docs
im
sure
its
purely
a
digital
chip
the
back
end
will
come
later
but
im
positive
it
wont
be
left
to
the
manufacturers
they
all
have
to
be
the

to
make

the

another
key

bites
the
dust
imho
one
of
the
candidates
that
has
been
suggested
for
a
key
registration
body
is
the
aclu
i
think
this
is
poor
choice
the
aclu
is
essentially
a
group
of
auditors
they
audit
how
peoples
civil
liberties
are
administered
traditionally
auditors
do
not
like
to
get
involved
in
the
design
or
operational
aspects
of
things
and
with
good
reason
when
i
was
a
systems
programmer
it
always
infuriated
me
that
the
auditors
would
come
in
and
tell
us
our
implementation
stunk
from
a
security
point
of
view
but
wouldnt
tell
us
how
to
fix
it
i
always
figured
they
just
liked
to
critcize
without
doing
the
work
to
help
fix
the
problem
then
i
took
a
stint
as
an
auditor
and
i
found
out
the
real
reason
auditors
dont
like
to
recommend
solutions
because
it
puts
them
in
a
bad
position
if
they
have
to
criticize
the
implementation
later
the
auditee
can
say
well
you
told
us
this
way
would
be
ok
it
compromises
the
independence
that
is
a
necessary
part
of
the
auditors
job
taking
the
case
at
hand
suppose
aclu
becomes
a
key
half
registrar
suppose
that
perhaps
through
some
error
on
aclus
part
a
key
half
gets
away
that
shouldnt
and
is
used
to
deprive
someone
of
her
civil
liberties
the
aclu
gets
wind
of
this
and
wants
to
take
it
to
court
but
they
end
up
being
at
the
same
time
on
the
side
of
the
defendant
and
of
the
plaintiff
which
is
not
an
easy
position
to
be
in
there
are
exceptions
to
the
complete
independence
of
auditors
at
one
place
where
i
worked
when
payroll
checks
were
printed
they
were
signed
automatically
by
a
signature
drum
on
the
bursting
machine
this
drum
was
kept
by
the
auditors
who
also
kept
the
check
stock
and
was
brought
down
to
data
processing
when
it
was
time
to
do
the
checks
i
believe
the
difference
between
this
situation
and
the
key
registration
situation
is
that
it
is
fairly
obvious
when
it
is
time
to
do
the
payroll
checks
if
they
were
done
yesterday
and
someone
wants
to
do
them
again
today
he
better
be
able
to
produce
yesterdays
checks
so
that
they
can
be
destroyed
determining
which
of
the
many
requests
for
key
halves
are
legit
is
a
trickier
process
one
much
more
prone
to
mistakes
that
could

how

what

encryption

if

what

what
is

put
another

the
question
im
asking
is
what
if
each
police
agency
that
wanted
a
particular
wiretap
had
to
pay
for
it
being
charged
their
share
of
the
full
social
cost
of
forcing
communication
to
be
wiretap
compatible
would
they
choose
to
buy
such
wiretaps
or
would
they
find
it
more
costeffective
to
instead
investigate
crimes
in
other
ways

discovery

why
doing

in

it
is
much
more
professional
to
steal
the

from

and
even
to
replace

that
does

are
that

not

anything

if

some

unless

is

no
because
the

will
still
be

decrypt

theyll

cannot

if

the

is
this
assumes
that
the

are

getting
such
a

is
the
whole
point
of
the
crime
under
discussion
to
be
sure
i
wouldnt
put
it
past
them
but
raising
the
possibility
of
such
crime
has
the
benefit
of
forcing
the
feds
to
either
fess
up
about
such
intentions
in
advance
or
state
that
using
clipper
exposes
the
user
to
an
additional
criminal
threat
g
no
the
criminals
will
just
use
some
secure

the
new
proposal
does
not
stop
criminals
it
ensures
that
the
government
will
be
able
to
wiretap
the
average
citizen
and
stops
the

it

finally
because
there
is
essentially
no
possibility
of
intercepting
in

the
scrutable
content
of

between
stolen

there
will
exist
strong
motivation
to
record
and
archive
all
communications
in
the
network
for
expostfacto
scrutiny
once
some
criminal
act
is
discovered
and
the
instruments
involved
have
been
identified
it
seems
likely
to
me
that
that
a
large
subset
of
encrypted
communications
would
be
archived
to
tape
so
they
could
be
read
if
sometime
in

probable

arises
and
a

i
can
even

from
chapter
xx
of
the
prince
by
n
macchiavelli
as
translated
by
daniel
donno
in
order
to
keep
their
lands
secure
some
princes
have
disarmed
their
subjects
others
have
prompted
division
within
the
cities
they
have
subjugated
some
have
nurtured
animosities
against
themselves
others
have
sought
to
win
the
approval
of
those
they
initially
distrusted
some
have
erected
fortresses
others
have
destroyed
them
now
although
it
is
impossible
to
set
down
definite
judgements
on
all
of
these
measures
without
considering
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
states
where
they
may
be
employed
i
shall
nevertheless
discuss
them
in
such
broad
terms
as
the
subject
itself
will
allow
to
begin
with
there
has
never
been
a
case
of
a
new
prince
disarming
his
subjects
indeed
whenever
he
found
them
disarmed
he
proceeded
to
arm
them
for
by
arming
your
subjects
you
make
their
arms
your
own
those
among
them
who
are
suspicious
become
loyal
while
those
who
are
already
loyal
remain
so
and
from
subjects
they
are
transformed
into
partisans
though
you
cannot
arm
them
all
nonetheless
you
increase
your
safety
among
those
you
leave
unarmed
by
extending
privileges
to
those
you
arm
your
different
treatment
of
the
two
categories
will
make
the
latter
feel
obligated
to
you
while
the
former
will
consider
it
proper
thoat
those
who
assume
added
duties
and
dangers
should
receive
advantages
when
you
disarm
your
subjects
however
you
offend
them
by
showing
that
either
from
cowardliness
or
from
lack
of
faith
you
distrust
them
and
either
conclusion
will
induce
them
to
hate
you
moreover
since
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
remain
unarmed
you
would
have
to
resort
to
mercenaries
whose
limitations
have
already
been
discussed
even
if
such
troops
were
good
however
they
could
never
be
good
enough
to
defend
you
from
powerful
enemies
and
doubtful
subjects
therefore
as
i
have
said
a
new
prince
in
a
newly
acquired
state
has
always
taken
measures
to
arm
his
subjects
and
history
is
full
of
examples
proving
that
this
is
so
but
when
a
prince
takes
posession
of
a
new
state
which
he
annexes
as
an
addition
to
his
original
domain
then
he
must
disarm
all
the
subjects
of
the
new
state
except
those
who
helped
him
to
acquire
it
and
these
as
time
and
occasion
permit
he
must
seek
to
render
soft
and
weak
he
must
arrange
matters
in
such
a
way
that
the
arms
of
the
entire
state
will
be
in
the
hands
of
soldiers
who
are
native
to
his
original
domain
and
since
the
subject
demands
it
i
will
not
fail
to
remind
any
prince
who
has
acquired
a
new
state
by
the
aid
of
its
inhabitants
that
he
soundly
consider
what
induced
them
to
assist
him
if
the
reason
is
not
natural
affection
for
him
but
rather
dissatisfaction
with
the
former
government
he
will
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
keep
them
friendly
for
it
will
be
impossible
to
please
them
if
he
will
carefully
think
the
matter
through
in
the
light
of
examples
drawn
from
ancient
and
modern
affairs
he
will
understand
why
it
is
much
easier
to
win
the
favor
of
those
who
were
happy
with
their
former
government
and
hence
were
his
enemies
than
to
keep
the
favor
of
those
who
out
of
dissatisfaction
with
the

helped

when
i
posted
thats
what
happens
when
you
read
news
at
home
when
youre
ratarsed
but
i
did
have
a
bunch
of
followups
going
on
about
cellularcordless
comms
the
original
article
has
reappeared
so
the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
hmm
telephone
communications
could
indeed
include
endtoend
encryption
on
ordinary
landlines
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
but
the
next
paragraph
says
telecoms
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
ok
its
far
from
clear
exactly
what
cripple
what
an
apposite
anagram
will
be
applied
to
but
the
reason
joe
public
wants
secure
comms
is
to
stop
people
listening
in
to
his
cellular
or
cordless
phones
and
he
wouldnt
even
be
bothered
about
that
were
it
not
for
wingnut
and
squidqys
misfortunes
yes
cripple
might
be
for
endtoend
encyption
dropping
to
clear
when
the
other
end
doesnt
have
cripple
but
then
a
cordlesstoordinary
conversation
would
be
in
clear
leaving
the
cordless
end
just
as
vulnerable
as
at
present
nope
i
suspect
that
cripple
will
only
be
used
on
radio
links
ok
its
possible
telecommunications
networks
could
mean
ordinary
phone
lines
but
im
betting
it
means
the
microwave
links
used
by
the
telcos
my
apologies
if
im
wrong
particularly
if
the
turgid
press
release
makes
it
clear
that
im
wrong
and
i
missed
it
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
was
full
of
obfuscation
and
anyone
expecting
endtoend
encryption
is
in
for
a
surprise
imho

since
the

the

to

why
is
not

as

of
have
you

do
so
before

this

again
it
refers
to
the

to

read
it
again
yourself
then
reapply
the
admonition
you
gave
to
the
previous
poster
to
yourself
as
well
the
first
clause
is
not
a
condition
it
is
a
reason
for
explicitly
supporting
the
right
which
exists
militia
or
not
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
keep
and
bear

this
is
not
a
right
granted
by
the
constitution
it
is
a
right
presumed
to
exist
by
default
the
constitution
mentioning
a
right
is
to
prevent
the
government
from
removing
that
right
by
stating
very
clearly
the

shall
not
infringe
mess
with

limit
that

is
a

on

to
tell

the
meaning

second
amendment
to
the

constitution
that
was
the
question
i
asked
ac
brocki
editorial
coordinator
of
the
los

unified
school
district
and
formerly
senior
editor
at
houghton
mifflin
publishers
who
himself
had
been
recommended
to
me
as
the
foremost
expert
on
english
usage
in
the
los
angeles
school
system
mr
brocki
told
me
to
get
in
touch
with
roy
copperud
a
retired
professor
journalism
at
the
university
of
southern
california
and
the
author
of
american
usage
and
style
the
consensus
a
little
research
lent
support
to
brockis
opinion
of
professor
copperuds
expertise
roy
copperud
was
a
newspaper
writer
on
major
dailies
for
over
three
decades
before
embarking
on
a
a
distinguished
career
teaching
journalism
at
usc
since
copperud
has
been
writing
a
column
dealing
with
the
professional
aspects
of
journalism
for
editor
and
publisher
a
weekly
magazine
focusing
on
the
journalism
field
hes
on

dictionary
frequently
cites
him
as
an

copperuds
fifth

on

american

and

the

has
been
in
continuous
print
from
van
nostrand
reinhold
since
and
is
the
winner
of
the
association
of
american
publishers
humanities
award
that
sounds
like
an
expert
to
me
after
a
brief
telephone
call
to
professor
copperud
in
which
i
introduced
myself
but
did
not
give
him
any
indication
of
why
i
was
interested
i
sent
the
following
letter
i
am
writing
you
to
ask
you
for
your
professional
opinion
as
an
expert
in
english
usage
to
analyze
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
extract
the
intent
from
the
text
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
is
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
for
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
the
debate
over
this
amendment
has
been
whether
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
is
a
restrictive
clause
or
a
subordinate
clause
with
respect
to
the
independent
clause
containing
the
subject
of
the
sentence
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
i
would
request
that
your
analysis
of
this
sentence
not
take
into
consideration
issues
of
political
impact
or
public
policy
but
be
restricted
entirely
to
a
linguistic
analysis
of
its
meaning
and
intent
further
since
your
professional
analysis
will
likely
become
part
of
litigation
regarding
the
consequences
of
the
second
amendment
i
ask
that
whatever
analysis
you
make
be
a
professional
opinion
that
you
would
be
willing
to
stand
behind
with
your
reputation
and
even
be
willing
to
testify
under
oath
to
support
if
necessary
my
letter
framed
several
questions
about
the
test
of
the
second
amendment
then
concluded
i
realize
that
i
am
asking
you
to
take
on
a
major
responsibility
and
task
with
this
letter
i
am
doing
so
because
as
a
citizen
i
believe
it
is
vitally
important
to
extract
the
actual
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
while
i
ask
that
your
analysis
not
be
affected
by
the
political
importance
of
its
results
i
ask
that
you
do
this
because
of
that
importance
after
several
more
letters
and
phone
calls
in
which
we
discussed
terms
for
his
doing
such
an
analysis
but
in
which
we
never
discussed
either
of
our
opinions
regarding
the
second
amendment
gun
control
or
any
other
political
subject
professor
copperud
sent
me
the
follow
analysis
into
which
i
have
inserted
my
questions
for
the
sake
of
clarity
copperud
the
words
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
contrary
to
the
interpretation
cited
in
your
letter
of
july
constitutes
a
present
participle
rather
than
a
clause
it
is
used
as
an
adjective
modifying
militia
which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
subject
the
right
verb
shall
the
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
asserted
as
an
essential
for
maintaining
a
militia
in
reply
to
your
numbered
questions
schulman
can
the
sentence
be
interpreted
to
grant
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
solely
to
a
wellregulated
militia
copperud
the
sentence
does
not
restrict
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
nor
does
it
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
elsewhere
or
by
others
than
the
people
it
simply
makes
a
positive
statement
with
respect
to
a
right
of
the
people
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
granted
by
the
words
of
the
second
amendment
or
does
the
second
amendment
assume
a
preexisting
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
merely
state
that
such
right
shall
not
be
infringed
copperud
the
right
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
its
existence
is
assumed
the
thrust
of
the
sentence
is
that
the
right
shall
be
preserved
inviolate
for
the
sake
of
ensuring
a
militia
schulman
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
conditioned
upon
whether
or
not
a
well
regulated
militia
is
in
fact
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
and
if
that
condition
is
not
existing
is
the
statement
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
null
and
void
copperud
no
such
condition
is
expressed
or
implied
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
not
said
by
the
amendment
to
depend
on
the
existence
of
a
militia
no
condition
is
stated
or
implied
as
to
the
relation
of
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
to
the
necessity
of
a
wellregulated
militia
as
a
requisite
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
deemed
unconditional
by
the
entire
sentence
schulman
does
the
clause
a
wellregulated
militia
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
grant
a
right
to
the
government
to
place
conditions
on
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
or
is
such
right
deemed
unconditional
by
the
meaning
of
the
entire
sentence
copperud
the
right
is
assumed
to
exist
and
to
be
unconditional
as
previously
stated
it
is
invoked
here
specifically
for
the
sake
of
the
militia
schulman
which
of
the
following
does
the
phrase
wellregulated
militia
mean
wellequipped
wellorganized
welldrilled
welleducated
or
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
copperud
the
phrase
means
subject
to
regulations
of
a
superior
authority
this
accords
with
the
desire
of
the
writers
for
civilian
control
over
the
military
schulman
if
at
all
possible
i
would
ask
you
to
take
account
the
changed
meanings
of
words
or
usage
since
that
sentence
was
written
years
ago
but
not
take
into
account
historical
interpretations
of
the
intents
of
the
authors
unless
those
issues
can
be
clearly
separated
copperud
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
meaning
of
words
or
in
usage
that
would
affect
the
meaning
of
the
amendment
if
it
were
written
today
it
might
be
put
since
a
wellregulated
militia
is
necessary
tot
he
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
shall
not
be
abridged
schulman
as
a
scientific
control
on
this
analysis
i
would
also
appreciate
it
if
you
could
compare
your
analysis
of
the
text
of
the
second
amendment
to
the
following
sentence
a
wellschooled
electorate
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
shall
not
be
infringed
my
questions
for
the
usage
analysis
of
this
sentence
would
be
is
the
grammatical
structure
and
usage
of
this
sentence
and
the
way
the
words
modify
each
other
identical
to
the
second
amendments
sentence
and
could
this
sentence
be
interpreted
to
restrict
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
read
books
only
to
a
welleducated
electorate
for
example
registered
voters
with
a
highschool
diploma
copperud
your
scientific
control
sentence
precisely
parallels
the
amendment
in
grammatical
structure
there
is
nothing
in
your
sentence
that
either
indicates
or
implies
the
possibility
of
a
restricted
interpretation
professor
copperud
had
only
one
additional
comment
which
he
placed
in
his
cover
letter
with
wellknown
human
curiosity
i
made
some
speculative
efforts
to
decide
how
the
material
might
be
used
but
was
unable
to
reach
any
conclusion
so
now
we
have
been
told
by
one
of
the
top
experts
on
american
usage
what
many
knew
all
along
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
unconditionally
protects
the
peoples
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
forbidding
all
governments
formed
under
the
constitution
from
abridging
that
right
as
i
write
this
the
attempted
coup
against
constitutional
government
in
the
soviet
union
has
failed
apparently
because
the
will
of
the
people
in
that
part
of
the
world
to
be
free
from
capricious
tyranny
is
stronger
than
the
old
guards
desire
to
maintain
a
monopoly
on
dictatorial
power
and
here
in
the
united
states
elected
lawmakers
judges
and
appointed
officials
who
are
pledged
to
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
ignore
marginalize
or
prevaricate
about
the
second
amendment
routinely
american
citizens
are
put
in
american
prisons
for
carrying
arms
owning
arms
of
forbidden
sorts
or
failing
to
satisfy
bureaucratic
requirements
regarding
the
owning
and
carrying
of
firearms
all
of
which
is
an
abridgement
of
the
unconditional
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
guaranteed
by
the
constitution
and
even
the
american
civil
liberties
union
aclu
staunch
defender
of
the
rest
of
the
bill
of
rights
stands
by
and
does
nothing
it
seems
it
is
up
to
those
who
believe
in
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
to
preserve
that
right
no
one
else
will
no
one
else
can
will
we
beg
our
elected
representatives
not
to
take
away
our
rights
and
continue
regarding
them
as
representing
us
if
they
do
will
we
continue
obeying
judges
who
decide
that
the
second
amendment
doesnt
mean
what
it
says
it
means
but
means
whatever
they
say
it
means
in
their
orwellian
doublespeak
or
will
be
simply
keep
and
bear
the
arms
of
our
choice
as
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
promises
us
we
can
and
pledge
that
we
will
defend
that
promise
with
our
lives

and
since
the
us
constitutions
guarantees
the
right
to
every
american
to
bear
arms
why
is
not
every
american
entitled
as
a
matter
of
have
you
read
the
applicable
part
of
the
constitution
and
interpreted
it
in
context
yes
btw
the
appropriate
amendments
were
posted
here
some
time
ago
if
not
please
do
so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individual
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
its
ok
its
ok
just
a
month
ago
i
expressed
my
belief
that
the
right
to
have
a
means
to
shoot
your
neighbor
is
not
that
much
necessary
to
ensure
a
peoples
right
to
be
free
and
got
flamed
by
lots
of
american
gun
supporters
so
i
thought
that
never
mind
the
new
cripple
chip
is
a
purely
american
problem
so
deal
with
the
mess
yourselves
i
just
wanted
to
share
with
you
a
bit
of
my
experience
of
living
years
under
a
totalitarian
regime
im
bulgarian
because
i
thought
that
it
might
be
useful
to
you
oh
well
i
think
your
experiences
under
the
bulgarian
regime
are
highly
relevant
we
have
too
many
people
with
their
heads
in
the
sand
saying
it
cannot
happen
here
as
our
constitutional
rights
are
being
trashed
every
day
because
the
government
justifies
doing
some
endrun
around
the
protections
by
a
crisis
requiring
drastic
action
it
is
most
likely
that
in
the
future
possession
of
secure
encryption
tools
will
be
regarded
as
possession
of
terrorist
and
drug
dealers
tools
and
be
some
serious
fedaral
felony
just
like
common
tools
are
burgular
tools
if
the
police
say
so
common
computer
programs
even
computers
themselves
are
now
hackers
tools
and
will
become
terrorist
tools
bet
on
it
the
insights
of
someone
who
has
lived
throught
this
are
very
important
if
the
us
goes
the
way
of
the
old
soviet
union
and
its
client
states
as
far
as
individual
rights
privacy
and
overall
freedom
are
concerned
the
rest
of
the
world
remember
new
world
order
will
not
be
far
behind
only
a
few
years
please
keep
posting
anything
you
find
that
is
deficient
or
that
threatens
ones
rights
in
this
thing
for
example
a
conversation
between
a
suspect
and
a
lawyer
will
no
longer
be
private
from
big
brother
eavesdropping
political
dissent
allready
is
very
dangerous
in
this
country
all
it
takes
is
the
government
to
decide
that
enough
people
will
take
one
seriously
then
one
becomes
guilty
of
plotting
to
overthrow
the
government
by
illegal
means
the
phrase
illegal
means
is
defined
as
whatever
the
government
wants
it
to
be
defined
as
couple
this
with
clintons
pressing
for
a
smart
national
id
card
an
internal
passport
with
the
added
wrinkle
that
anything
about
you
and
your
past
can
be
put
on
it
and
you
can
only
take
the
governments
word
as
to
what
is
really
on
it
since
they
will
be
the
only
ones
with
the
means
to
completely
read
and
reprogram
the
thing
isnt
that
nice
while
the
feds
can
bust
into
ones
safe
without
the
keys
the
owner
knows
his
safe
has
been
broken
into
when
they
break
into
your
secure
phone
conversations
or
other
storedtransmitted
data
in
the
near
future
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
so
accountability
as
to
the
legalities
has
gone
out
the
window
just
like
a
safe
if
they
have
a
legal
cause
they
can
get
the
keys
from
the
suspect
just
like
they
can
get
the
keys
to
a
safe
or
the
combination
from
the
suspect
same
with
encryption
record
everything
get
the
warrants
then
decode
it
with
the
keys
obtained
from
the
suspect
this
clinton
cripple
along
with
its
natural
extensions
will
make
any
priviliged
communications
between
client
and
lawyer
and
any
meaningful
political
dissent
virtually
impossible
which
is
the
general
idea
any
propeganda
about
its
being
secure
and
the
safeguards
and
all
of
that
are
just
that
propeganda
to
reassure
people

they

they

one
minor
nitpick
it

it

it

the

it
obviously
has
been
budgeted
the
whole

that
is
what
is
so
upsetting
this
was
all
done

they
didnt

this
and
just
anyone
wont
be
permitted
access
to
enough
of
the
internals
to
make

chances
are
that
the
government
has
classified
some
details
of
the
internals
at
a
very
high
level
and
manufacturers
are
required
to
observe

clearances
corresponding

that
level
while
not
perfect
it
would
prevent
joe

from
rolling

not

can
survive
a

some
of
the

notorious

have
already

its

the
point
here
is
not
the

it
is
like
having
the

telling

that
they
want

key

box
keys
etc
and
telling

that
they
wont
use
them
unless
its
totally
neccessary
i
sure
wouldnt
want
that
why
should
encryption
be
any
different
actually
the
govrnment
is
telling
you
that
if
you
want
to
use
their
product
the
manufacturer
actually
better
yet
some
trusted
pair
of
escrow
agencies
has
to
have
the
key
most
of
us
already
are
in
this
situationour
car
makers
have
keys
to
our
cars
or
can
get
them
quickly
from
the
vin
number
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
presented
with
a
court
order
theyd
surrender
copies
to
the
government
chances
are
that
many
locksmiths
have
the
code
numbers
for
house
locks
theyve
installed
and
in
an
emergency
can
cut
keys
thus
theyd
also
provide
such
keys
to
the

pursuant

a
court
order
the
state
has
no
difficulty
gaining
access
to
your
safe

if
they
have
a

bad
analogy
this
is
not
to
argue
for

against

rather
better

are

the

the
specter

only
one
step
removed
from
the
old

an

similarly
lpf

radical

if
it
is
an
offshoot
of
physicians

best

for
helen

her
hysterical
antinuclear

then
it
probably
also
carries
unwelcome
political
baggage
perhaps
for
practical
reasons
a
lobbying
organization
for

would
best
be
formed
under
the

some

its

i
say
in
theory
because
in
another
case
a
woman
was
held
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
reveal
the
location
of
her
child
even
after
taking
the
in
this
case
the
woman
was
suspected
of
having
murdered
the
kid
so
taking
the
wasnt
surprising
sure
so
she
was
probably
guilty
but
thats
not
good
enough
in
our
system
youre
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
force
a
suspect
to
confess
to
a
crime
no
matter
how
strongly
you
think
theyre
guilty
you
have
to
develop
your
evidence
independently
doing
otherwise
might
catch
a
few
more
crooks
but
only
at
the
cost
of
turning
the
clock
back
to
the
middle
ages
when
confessions
were
routinely
tortured
out
of
suspects
both
guilty
and
innocent
ok
i
should
have
read
the
thread
before
posting
my
own
i
would
just
add
to
phils
very
infomative
discussion
the
following
caveat
the
fifth
amendment
applies
only
in
crinial
cases
nor
shall
any
person
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
thus
if
the
father
sued
for
custody
of
the
children
the
case
would
be
civil
and
the
defendant
mother
would
not
have
fifth
amendment
protection
oddly
enough
her
refusal
to
give
information
in
a
civil
case
can
lead
to
criminal
contempt
charges
thus
landing
her
in
jail
the
interesting
part
of
all
this
is
that
in
a
murder
trial
the
woman
can
plead
the
fifth
as
to
the
location
of
the
childthis
is
routine
a
computer
crime
prosecution
thus
would
seem
to
be
fertile
ground
for
this
kind
of
defense
where
a
suit
by
a
party
injured
by
hackers
would
not
if
i
am
accused
for
example
of
sending
encrypted
kiddie
porn
over
the
nets
the
fifth
should
protect
my
key
if
i
am
accused
of
sending
copyrighted
material
however
it
proabably
will
not
copyright
infringement
not
being
a
crime
in
the
technical
sense
the
really
tricky
question
is
say
i
do

i

the

use

information
gained
in

civil
trial
ie
my
key
to
gain

for

ok

guess
what

propose

you
wont

meanwhile
those

might

about

right
so
there
should
be
some
way
for

quickly

i
perhaps

and
more

thats
what
i
get

i
made
is
that
localstate
police
agencies
attempting

legit
escrowed
keys
etc
may
find
themselves
at
the

of
bureaucratic
inertia
and
agency
infighting
at
the
federal
level
i
disagree
that
this
would
assist
civil
liberties
by
hobbling
the
cowboy
cops
it
would
be
a
strong
incentive
as
vesselin
points
out
for
more
police
agencies
to
go
rogue
and
try
to
get
keys
through
more
efficient
but
less
constitutional
means
notice
what
the
release
said
q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
the
clear
implication
is
that
there
are
legal
authorizations
other
than
a
court
order
just
how
leaky
are
these
and
who
knows
whats
in
those
pages
that
authorized
the
nsa
there
may
well
arise
a
black
market
of
sorts
within
police
agencies
in
which
keys
are
traded
furthermore
the
police
will
be
in
an
excellent
position
to
carry
out
this
kind
of
thing
without
being
caught
they
already
have
a
communication
infrastructure
with
secure
portions
there
are
a
few
laws
that
i
know
of
that
limit
citizens
rights
to
access
police
communications
or
use
the
information
they
get
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
prove

misuse
the
fact
that
you
have

may
itself
be

that
you

william
gibson
must
be
loving
it
great
story
material
dont

itll
happen
well
consider
eg
the
michigan
state
police
generally
a
very
professional
organization
which
for
years
kept
red
files
on
thousands
of
suspected
commies
knowing
full
well
it
was
not
consititutional
the
standards
of
evidence
were
just
about
zero
people
were
in
the
file
because
they
happened
to
park
near
a
place
where
say
a
uschina
peoples
friendship
rally
was
happening
the
police
went
around
writing
down
license
plate
numbers
if
you
happened
to
be
visiting
a
friend
who
lived
near
the
meeting
place
well
the
state
police
wound
up
filing
you
as
a
subversive
they
were
eventually
found
out
and
a
court
ruled
against
carrying
on
any
more
such
nonsense
i
believe
thay
may
have
had
to
destroy
the
tapes
as
well
even
with
wellmeaning
cops
and
im
sure
there
are
many
there
will
be
strong
pressure
to
bend
the
constitutional
safeguards
we
dont
need
to
assume
corrupt
or
unbalanced
officers
it
will
all
be
in
the
interest
of
enforcing
sensible
laws
saving
lives

information
for
those
who
choose
not
to
stay
in
the
dormitories
the
following
is
a
partial
list
of
hotels
in
the
area
those
who
choose
to
stay
off
campus
are
responsible
for
making
their
own
reservations
and
early
reservations
are
advised
since
august
is
a
popular
season
in
santa
barbara
note
that
goleta
is
closer
to
ucsb
than
santa
barbara
but
that
a
car
will
probably
be
required
to
travel
between
any
hotel
and
the
campus
all
prices
are
subject
to
change
prices
should
be
confirmed
by
calling
the
individual
hotels
directly
however
mention
when
you
are
making
your
reservation
and
in
several
of
the
hotels
listed
you
will
be
eligible
for
the
university
rate
which
can
be
significantly
less
than
the
normal
rates
we
are
not
able
to
block
rooms
in
these
hotels
so
please
make
reservations
as
early
as
possible
the
quality
of
the
hotels
range

the
best
subject
re
clipper
considered
harmful
in
article
bradoptilinkcom
brad
yearwood
writes
if
clipper
comes
to
cellular
phones
along
with
legal
proscriptions
against
using
other
cipher
systems
on
these
phones
a
new
and
potentially
dangerous
class
of
crime
is
created
aside
from
possession
of
terrorist
tools
unapproved
encryption
devices
or
programs
criminals
who
very
badly
want
inscrutable
tactical
communications
specifically
the
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
who
proponents
of
key
escrow
cite
as
threats
will
be
highly
motivated
to
steal
the
cipher
phone
of
a
legitimate
user
and
to
kill
this
person
or
hold
them
hostage
so
discovery
of
compromise
of
the
device
will
be
delayed
once
a
suitable
collection
of
devices
is
stolen
criminals
can
communicate
with
impunity
assuming
the
cipher
system
carries
no
trapdoors
apart
from
key
escrow
until
and
unless
the
compromise
is
discovered
by
some
other
means
because
lifeischeap
criminals
are
currently
willing
to
kill
people
to
steal
very
large
and
conspicuous
property
luxury
cars
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
they
will
be
willing
to
kill
people
to
steal
small
and
inconspicuous
property
a
cipher
cellular
phone
just
as
we
have
seen
in
the
past
with
blue
box
technology
and
in
the
present
with
modified
cellular
phones
we
can
expect
to
see
among
highstakes
criminals
a
lucrative
market
for
stolen
cipher
phones
which
can
be
used
for
a
few
days
the
highstakes
criminals
will
pay
the
lifeischeap
types
substantial
amounts
for
stolen
instruments
because
a
person
is
typically
discovered
as
missing
or
dead
in
a
few
days
a
stolen
instrument
will
be
usable
for
only
a
few
days
there
will
be
a
continuing
demand
for
fresh
phones
fresh
bodies
and
since
clinton
is
also
going
fullbore
to
deny
unconnected
citizens
the
means
to
defend
themselves
we
will
protect
you
is
good
enough
for
you
by
perverting
or
trashing
the
second
amendment
the
targeted
individuals
will
be
guaranteed
easy
prey
what
is
a
few
bodies
compared
to
the
greater
good
of
the
fed
being
able
to
defeat
a
citizens
security
with
impunity
you
dont
think
there
doesnt
exist
a
means
by
which
the
nsa
can
do
their
usual
eavesdropping
scanning
for
keywords
with
or
without
a
court
order
or
any
keys
do
you
if
so
i
got
some
great
florida
real
estate
you
might
be
interested
in
perhaps
the
idea
of
escrowed
keys
is
meant
to
divert
the
discussion
to
how
they
will
be
safeguarded
and
away
from
the
basic
fact
that
the
government
is
systematically
taking
away
our
right
to
privacy
to
be
secure
for
the
means
of
selfdefense
and
just
about
every
other
right
spelled
out
in
the
bill
of
rights
nawwww
they
are
the
government
trust
us
in
other
words
clipper
and
similar
systems
have
the
potential
to
turn
a
current
inconvenience
to
law
enforcement
into
a
direct
vicious
and
persistent
threat
to
the
general
public
what
is
more
important
to
the
government
law
enforcement
people
control
or
the
safety
of
the
general
public
the
gun
control
issue
should
answer
that
one
look
at
how
good
that
works
in
making
cities
safer
the
places
that
are
the
worst
in
that
regard
are
also
the
places
with
the
best
gun
control
government
is
not
about

it
is
about

re

actually
many
of
us
have
noted
this
we
have
noted
that
the
program
started
at
least
years
ago
that
the
contracts
with
vlsi
technology
and
microtoxin
were
let
at
least
months
ago
that
production
of
the
chips
is
well
underway
and
so
forth
nobody
i
know
has
claimed
clinton
intitiated
the
program
but
he
chose
to
go
ahead
with
it
perhaps
the
nsa
realised
that
noone
would
even
contemplate
falling
for
the
dualescrow
bluff
while
under
the
bush
administration
and
had
to
wait
for
a
democrat
govt
to
con
into
promoting
this

might
just

halccocaltechedu
hal
finney
writes
the
key
question
is
whether
nonclipper
encryption
will
be
made
illegal
it
seems
pretty
obvious
that
it
will
be
made
illegal
if
very
loud
noise
is
not
made
about
this
immediately
to
congress
and
the
house
it
looks
like
the
worst
nightmares
raised
by
dorothy
dennings
proposals
are
coming
true
if
the
government
continues
on
this
course
i
imagine
that
we
will
see
strong
cryptography
made
illegal
encryption
programs
for
disk
files
and
email
as
well
as
software
to
allow
for
encrypted
voice
communications
will
be
distributed
only
through
the
underground
people
will
have
to
learn
how
to
hide
the
fact
that
they
are
protecting
their
privacy
i
dont
know
whats
worse
the
waste
of
money
or
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
all
clintons
rhetoric
to
the
contrary
this
is
a
feeble
attempt
by
a
large
group
of
bored
intelligence
bureaucrats
to
justify
their
currently
useless
jobs
clinton
said
he
was
going
to
trim
the
fat
from
the
government
this
doesnt
look
very
dietetic
to
me
as
i
said
before
in
this
group
drug
dealing
and
terrorism
both
tend
to
be
international
crimes
which
are
not
going
to
cease
if
the
us
starts
to
regulate
encryption
the
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
will
simply
go
to
other
countries
to
communicate
their
plans
and
will
still
carry
them
out
here
andor
wherever
else
this
is
not
the
solution
to
the
problem
they
try
to
invent
a
new
problem
by
saying
we
need
encryption
i
guess
its
a
good
thing

its
true
that

probably
prevent

cheap
secure
crypto
for

is
a
political

the

to
access
telephone
calls
and
data
under

court
or
other
legal
order
when
necessary
to
protect
our

q
suppose
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
conducting
a
wiretap
on
a
drug
smuggling
ring
and
intercepts
a
conversation
encrypted
using
the
device
what
would
they
have
to
do
to
decipher
the
message
a
they
would
have
to
obtain
legal
authorization
normally
a
court
order
to
do
the
wiretap
in
the
first
place
they
would
then
present
documentation
of
this
authorization
to
the
two
entities
responsible
for
safeguarding
the
keys
and
obtain
the
keys
for
the
device
being
used
by
the
drug
smugglers
the
key
is
split
into
two
parts
which
are
stored
separately
in
order
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
in
these
two
sections
the
phrases
or
other
legal
order
and
normally
a
court
order
imply
there
is
some
other
way
or
ways
of
doing
a

what
isare
these
how
do
they
affect
the
way
people
who
trust
the
system
of
court
orders
to
protect
them
feel
about
this
escrow
system
the
second
section
shows
the
sequence
of
events
the
law
enforcer
armed
with
his
warrant
attaches
his
headphones
to
the
line
with
his
crocclips
remember
these
are
the
folk
who
couldnt
cope
with
digital
telephony
and
hears
a
load
of
modemlike
tones
we
are
talking
analogue
telephony
here
what
next
what
modulation
scheme
do
these
clipper
boxes
use
is
it
possible
to
record
the
tones
for
use
after
the
keys
are
obtained
i
thought
it
was
quite
difficult
to
record
a
modem
session
at
some
intermediate
point
on
the
line
maybe
they
have
taken
a
crash
course
in
data
comms
and
have
a
unit
that
demodulates
the
tones
and
stores
the
digital
stream
for
decryption
later
this
would
still
suffer
from
the
same
problems
as
trying
to
record
the
tones
as
the
demodulator
would
not
be
at
one
end
of
the
line
if
calls
cant
be
recorded
for
decryption
later
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
foil
the
system
by
buying
lots
of
clipper
units
these
are
supposed
to
be
cheap
mass
market
items
and
using
them
in
turn
how
tolerant
is
the
modulation
scheme
to
errors
these
things
are
proposed
for
use
by
us
corporations
to
secure
their
foreign
offices
where
phone
line
quality
may
well
be
poor
it
seems
hard
enough
to
me
to
get
digitised
speech
of
any
quality
into
something
a
modem
can
handle
without
having
to
add
lots
of
error
correction
to
keep
the
decryption
in
sync
q
will
the
devices
be
exportable
will
other
devices
that
use
the
government
hardware
a
voice
encryption
devices
are
subject
to
export
control
requirements
one
of
the
attractions
of
this
technology
is
the
protection
it
can
give
to
us
companies
operating
at
home
and
abroad
with
this
in
mind
we
expect
export
licenses
will
be
granted
on
a
casebycase
basis
for
us
companies
seeking
to
use
these
devices
to
secure
their
own
communications
abroad
this
raises
an
intersting
question
in
the
uk
here
it
is
illegal
to
connect
anything
to
a
public
telecomms
network
without
it
being
approved
by
a
body
called
babt
it
has
been
stated
either
here
or
in
the
uktelecom
group
that
they
will
not
approve
equipment
that
does
encryption
i
dont
know
if
this
is
true
or
not
but
this
would
make
a
good
test
case
perhaps
friendly
countries
and
the

may
still
qualify

it

it

you

they

key
change
or
input
change
if
they
were
out
to
build
a
weak
cryptosystem
it
might
be
the
case
that
some
of
the
bits
are
much
less
powerful
than
others
in
the
sense
that
they
only
enter
into
the
encryption
very
late
in
the
game
by
contrast
des
was
designed
to
use
each
key
bit
as
early
as
possible
the
output
change
rate
appears
as
early
as
round
again
though
i
dont
think
nsa
is
going
to
cheat
that
crudely
theyre
likely
to
get
caught
remember
that
theyve
promised
to
let
a
committee
of
outside
experts
see
the
cryptosystem
design
if
you
assume
something
deslike
a
biased
subkey
generation
schedule
will
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
the
committee
can
and
should
run
lots
of
tests
and
retain
the
output
this
can
be
verified
later
against
the
chip
and
yes
the
civilian
community
has
at
least
some
secure
storage
facilities
that
i
dont
think
even
nsa
can
get
into
without
it
being
noticed
until
fort
meade
gets
its
transporter
working
again
oops
i
dont
think
i
was
supposed
to
talk
about
that
the
committee
members
can
even
retain
secure
copies
of
the
code
in
two
halves
which
you
have
to
xor
together
to
recover
the
program
seriously
there
are
i
think
problems
with
this
whole
scheme
but
the
people
who
invented
it
arent
stupid
and
theyve
been
in
the
crypto
game
and
the
smokeandmirrors
game
far
longer
than
most
of
us
theyre
not
going
to
lie
in
ways
that
can
be
detected
easily
since
their
credibility
is
the
only
thing
they
can
use
to
sell
this
system
if
theyve
lied
about
the
civilian
committee
no
one
will
believe
them
about
the
absence
of
other
back
doors
if
theyve
lied
about
the
key
size
no
one
will
believe
that
they
havent
copied
the
programming
disk
with
the
u
keys
if
theyve
lied
about
obvious
aspects
of
the
strength
of
the
cryptosystem
no
one
will
believe
the
escrow
agencies
arent
in
cahoots
with
them
that
isnt
to
say
that
they
arent
lying
about
all
those
other
things
anyway
and
im
certainly
not
claiming
that
nsa
cant
build
a
cryptosystem
with
a
back
door
that
the
committee
cant
find
look
how
long
it
took
for
folks
to
believe
that
the
sboxes
werent
sabotaged
its
entirely
possible
that
the

will
release
an
ambiguous
report
for
just
such
reasons
but
thats
a
subtle
point
ie
one
you
cant
explain
to
a
senator
anyway
its
looking
like
the
keys
and
escrow
arrangements
are
smoke
and
mirrors
to
cover
the
way
the
nsa
can
regenerate
the
key
from
the
transmitted

i
dont
like

any
better
than
you
do
however
and

if
there
are
many
as

people
in
the
usa
who
reason
like
the
above
then
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
the
current
plot
has
been
allowed
to
happen
the
willingness
of
the
majority
of
the
people
to
give
up
their
freedom
in
exchange
for
a
sense
of
safety
is
hardly
limited
to
the
usa
and
is
an
endemic
problem
in
any
human
society
of
any
appreciable
size
the
structure
of
the
us
government
does
try
to
combat
this
tendency
to
some
extent
but
fighting
entropy
is
always
a
losing
battle
most
people
would
rather
have
comfort
than
freedom
the
paradox
is
that
you
cant
really
have
the
former
in
the
long
term
unless
you
have
the
latter
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
probably
come
across
to
some
people
as
a
weird
cross
between
a
libertarian
and
an
establishment
tool
is
that
i
end
up
taking
an
utterly
pragmatic
view
of
government
i
dont
get
up
in
arms
when
the
government
fails
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
people
because
in
my
lifetime
it
never
hastherefore
i
have
no
expectation
that
it
will
as
a
result
i
protect
my
own
interests
rather
than
expecting
the
government
to
be
fair
i
will
use
strong
cryptography
when
i
think
it
is
needed
whether
or
not
it
is
legal
at
the
time
same
thing
with
anything
else
the
government
would
rather
not
see
in
private
handsthats
their
problem
whats
important
to
me
is
using
the
right
tool
for
the
job
if
its
legal
so
much
the
better
if
it
is
not
but
does
not
violate
my
very
strong
sense
of
personal
ethics
i
will
use
it
anyway
as
long
i
think
it
is
worth
it
expecting
the
government
to
actually
protect
the
interests
of
its
citizens
except
by
accident
is
utter
folly
even
jefferson
one
of
the
major
architects
of
the
american
system
of
government
figured
that
in
a
couple
hundred
years
it
would
become
so
corrupt
and
selfserving
that
it
would
be
time
dismantle
it
and
try
again
by
revolution
if
necessary
i
agree
and
while
i
dont
go
around
trying
to
spark
one
ill
certainly
participate
if
it
happens
when
im
around
there
is
a
reason
i
am
such
a

not
those
that
have

lets
start
with
looking
at
the
professionals
the
nsa
itself
its
birth
was
by
secret
executive
order
by
harry
s
truman
in
until
even
not
even
one
word
of
this
executive
order
chartering
the

was
sealed

right
on
the
outside
of
the

complex
is
a
ten
foot
cyclone
fence
with
multiple
rows
of
barbed

with
high

complete
with
signs
prohibiting
even
making

under

of

the

is
completely
scanned
by
closed

more
paranoia
these
are
professionals
maybe
they
know
something
we
dont
eh
do
you
think
it
would
have
helped
admiral
yamamoto
if
the
japanese
had
been
a
little
more
paranoid
of
their
purple
cipher
or
maybe
the
germans
should
have
been
a
little
more
paranoid
about
their
engima
with
respect
to
turing
and
the
british
how
about
the
cracking
of
the
zimmerman
telegram
would
a
little
more
paranoia
have
helped
the
germans
here
maybe
the
nsa
should
have
been
a
little
more
paranoid
about
emma
woikin
or
joseph
sidney

or
maybe
you
want

with

to
suppress

diplomatic
secrets
or
even

paranoia
right
the

was
the
onetime

even
with
the

of
keeping
incriminating

i
could

the

yes

guess
what

now
you

generally
an

the

the

lots

mixing

probably
a

it
diffuses
the

it
may
well
diminish
the

index
of
the
combined

it
is
not

it
would

i

a

the

with

that

you

the

thing
that
worries
me
is
that

can
do

automatically
in

other
than
that

this

they

all

let
me
just
point
out
that
there
already

suchlike
that
have
whats

which
can
be

after
youve
verified
all

this
makes
it
impossible
to

out
the

ignoring
the
reverse
engineering
questions
speaking
from
experience
here
i
had
to
completely

one
of

some
six

seven
years

when
the

zapped
the

were
all
bad
and
the

were
unreadable
because
of
the

made
me
appreciate
the
value
of
printouts
so
on
this
point
at
least
theres
not
so
much
worry
but
whether
or
not
we
can
get
the
chips
made
reliably
and
securely
is
really
secondary
to
the
question
of
whether

its

can
you
replace

presumably
an

to
avoid
attracting

the

wont

you

they

however
mr

his

well
before
the

this
is
for
several

several
of

size
could
never

they

att

blew

the
security
of
the
crypto
system
is
lost
forever
these
keys
can
end
up
in
the
hands
of
any
agency
of
the
government
the
fact
that
the
escrowed
keys
never
change
means
that
the
algorithm
is
vulnerable
over
time
to
an
attacker
the
classified
algorithm
may
hide
another
backdoor
but
he
feels
that
it
is
probably
to
keep
people
from
forging
fake
serial
numbers
or
changing
the
keys
themselves
additionally
he
feels
that
the
nsa
has
probably
spent
enough
time
and
money
in
working
on
a
way
to
keep
this
chip
from
being
reversed
engineered
that
he
feels
that
reverse
engineering
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
do
he
feels
that
they
have
developed
a
suitable
technique
to
protect
the
chip
from
this
attack
also
he
feels
that
the
chip
is
hardware
encoded
with
the
algorithm
and
not
microcoded
onto
the
chip
additonally
i
spoke
with
mr
melnick
about
their
algorithm
he
couldnt
tell
me
much
about
their
new
agorithm
because
it
hasnt
been
patented
yet
however
he
told
me
a
little
the
algorithm
will
be
released
for
public
review
after
patents
have
been
granted
for
it
this
is
so
the
crypto
community
can
see
that
it
is
secure
the
algorithm
is
called
nea
for
new
encryption
algorithm
the
details
were
sketchy
because
now
it
is
held
as
a
trade
secret
until
the
patent
was
issued
but
i
was
told
that
it
will
incorporate
the
following
it
will
have
fast
encryption
of
data
exact
specs
not
given
but
mr
melnick
stated
much
faster
than
what
an
can
put
out
it
is
a
symmetric
cipher
just
like
idea
and
des
it
will
use
bit
data
blocks
for
encryption
like
des
and
idea
the
key
length
was
not
given
to
me
but
mr
melnick
states
that
it
is
adujustable
and
is
more
than
adequate
for
security
the
algorithm
is
written
in
c
and
assembler
in
software
form
and
can
be
ported
to
many
platforms
unlike
the
the
clipper
chip
which
is
hardware
only
and
cannot
be
made
into
software
this
i
consider
a
definite
plus
for
the
nea
for
widespread
use
the
algorithm
will
accomodate
public
key
distribution
techniques
such
as
rsa
or
diffiehellman
this
will
also
be
supported
in
the
hardware
chip
right
now
the
projected
cost
of
the
nea
chip
will
be
about
dollars
for
each
clipper
will
run
each
chip
that
is
if
it
is
produced
enough
which
probably
wont
happen
they
currently
sell
a
program
called
ccom
that
uses
the
algorithm
and
a
special
streaming
protocol
that
does
not
divide
the
encrypted
data
into
blocks
this
could
prevent
plaintext
attacks
if
you
know
what
the
block
header
is
this
program
operates
at
all
supported
speeds
and
uses
the
software
implementation
of
the
algorithm
most
importantly
it
does
not
have
a
backdoor
right
now
the
company
is
afraid
that
the
new
clipper
chip
will
put
them
out
of
business
this
is
a
very
real
possibility
so
they
really
need
help
in
stopping
the
clipper

from
becoming

the

that

this

furthermore
your

will

you

what
about

if

why
does
the

have
to

there
are
plenty
of
encryption
algorithms
that
dont

upon
nondisclosure

so
why
in
the

use
one
that

are
reasons
of

but
i
certainly
cant
think
of
any
honest
ones

you

we

the
last
time
i
checked
every

experienced
unauthorized

corruption

fabrication
of
supposedly

yeah

now
were
serious
so
you
can

finally
although
you
didnt

you
implicitly
assume
that
the

reasonable
the
case
in

serving
a
deliberately
fraudulant

tells
me
that

remember
that
all
this

private

interestingly
enough
in
designing
the
escrow
we
may
want
to
use
some
rather
unusual
technology
such
as
sealed
boxes
of
paper
or
destructive
read
memory
rather
than
typical
computer
databases
which
is
fun
for
a
database
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
keys
to
me
a
larger
problem
is
that
once
disclosed
your
keys
could
be
used
to
decrypt
any
previously
recorded
conversations
i
gather
that
from
this
proposal
a
warrant
would
be
required
to
get
the
keys
but
not
to
collect
conversations
consider
the
scenario
where
an
agency
collects
preemptively
all
encrypted
conversations
for
certain
people
likely
to
be
targets
and
not
necessarily
legitimate
targets
then
arranges
for
some
unrelated
incident
that
can
trigger
a
warrant
your
honor
we
know
that
the
suspect
has
received
calls
from
noted
crime
figure
bugsy
butthead
said
calls
arranged
by
the
agency
and
we
must
therefore
have
this
warrant
to
determine
whether
this
suspect
in
a
sensitive
govt
post
is
corrupt
i
suppose
that
it
is
conceivable
that
there
are
session
keys
involved
somewhere
but
that
doesnt
seem
likely
if
there
are
why
wouldnt
the
technical
overview
mention
them
when
it
goes
to
such
details
as
the
number
of
bits
held
by
each
escrow
authority
this
scheme
is
full
of
holes

stinks

i
dont
find
this
a

for
two
reasons
one
you

supplied
below
unless
i
care
about
entering
the

at
any

eg
the

btw
have
been

to
decap

reproduce
it
on

pirating

who

i

only
people

who
does
care
about

for

reasons
will
sit
up
and
follow
laws
like
this
but
i
would
contend
that
were
not
the
main
threat
i
also
have
grave
doubts
whether
an
algorythm
widely
distributed
in
silicon
could
possibly
be
called
classified
its
like
handing
out
military
secrets
to
the
whole
world
in
envelopes
marked
dont
open
me
i
can
imagine
several
credible
defences
which
could
be
employed
if
it
came
to
a
trial
one
would
be
the
stupidity
of
the
governments
actions
perhaps
some
foreign
governments
or
corporations
could
help
us
out
by
cracking
the
system
outside
the
usa
the
us
government
could
probably
stop
importation
of
clone
hardware
but
a
software
implementation
should
be
practical
amusing
thought
could
they
have
employed
an
algorythm
which
is
infeasable
for
a
fast
software
implementation
but
which
is
easy
in
custom
hardware
in
des
the
extensive
use
of
permutation
tables
trivial
in
hardware
you
just
swap
bus
lines
but
relatively
slow
in
software
have
had
a
big
effect
on
the
speed
difference
between
hardware
and
software
implementations
of
that
cipher
indeed
i
suspect
that
lucifers
designers
were
well
aware
that
it
would
be
and
approved
certain
algorythms
usually
parallel
search
algorythms
can
be
very
slow
in
software
yet
can
fly
in
custom
hardware
i
have
no
proof
of
their
employment
in
clipper
it
is
pure
conjecture
however
as
a
software
implementation
of
this
cipher
is
something
that
its
designers
would
have
been
trying
to
avoid
at
all
costs
then
the
inclusion
of
such
techniques
seems
credible
hmmm
i
also
wonder
what
intergraph
thinks
about
the
use
of
the

clipper

any

i
must
admit
that
this

has

running

for

one
the

it

before
someone
decaps

and
after
a

of

has
full

of
the

this
isnt
trivial
to
do

then
again
it
is
not

any

decent

figure
out
the

on

indeed
this
is
not
an
uncommon
exercise
performed
during
training
because
it
makes
you
think
about
design
decisions
made
by
other
designers
i
could
speculate
that
these
chips
are
going
to
be
manufactured
using
tamperproof
carriers
unlikely
such
techniques
are
very
expensive
and
this
thing
is
supposed
to
be
relatively
cheap
to
produce
or
that
there
will
be
some
legal
or
legislative
framework
to
prevent
publication
of
the
algorythm
unlikely
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
arent
these
supposed
to
be
sold
internationally
i
suppose
that
the
most
likely
reason
the
algorythm
is
remaining
secret
for
the
moment
is
that
some
idiot
bureaucrat
untrammeled
by
the
realities
of
the
situation
decided
that
well
we
should
keep
it
a

because
it
is
supposed
to
be

isnt
it

anything
the

opinion
at

what

is

what
they
do
is
what

and
the

are
reluctant

furthermore
congress

clinton

firmly

anytime
a

believes
in

the

will
use
every

possible
to
retain
that

and
take
more
we
have
to
take

back
otherwise
we
will
end
up
living
in
the
equivalent
of
a
hightech
third

dictatorship
we
have
to
take
responsibility
for
ourselves
our
personal
welfare
and
our
actions
i
totally
agree
but
how
do
you
propose
we
take
government
back
they
obviously
dont
listen
to
the
people
or
want
the
people
to
know
who
is
responsibile
for
what
a
person
telnetted
the
site
of
the
clipper
chip
release
to
see
what
the
entity
clipper
was
and
got
a
few
lists
but
when
another
person
tried
a
bit
later
the
commands
were
disabled
does
not
sound
like
an
administration
that
wants
to
have
any
accountability
or
information
they
dont
control
given
to
the
people
the
secret
development
and

of

decision
further
backs
that
up
you

tools
and
also
subject

civil

along
with
the

that

you
watch
see
if
i
am
wrong
the

is
not
going

be
very
cooperative
about
the

taking

back

they
have
all

unlimited

almost
all

those

waco

be

of
what
to

the

on

the

announced
a

initiative
that
will
bring
together
the
federal
government
and
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
provide
secure
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
at
the
heart
of
the
plan
is
a
new
tamperproof
encryption
chip
called
the
clipper
chip
together
with
a
splitkey
approach
to
escrowing
keys
two
escrow
agencies
are
used
and
the
key
parts
from
both
are
needed
to
reconstruct
a
key
chip
contents
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
singlekey
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
takes
clock
ticks
and
in
electronic
codebook
ecb
mode
runs
at
mbits
per
second
each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all

this
length
is

they
are

will

the

is

imagine
that
it
is
embedded
in
the
att

security
device
as
it
will
be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
an
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
this
key
negotiation
takes
place
without
the
clipper
chip
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
such
as
the
diffiehellman
publickey
distribution
method
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the
conversation
or
message
stream
m
digitized
voice
the
telephone
security
device
feeds
k

chip
programming
and
escrow
all
clipper
chips
are
programmed
inside
a
scif
secure
compartmented
information
facility
which
is
essentially
a
vault
the
scif
contains
a
laptop
computer
and
equipment
to
program
the
chips
about
chips
are
programmed
during
a
single
session
the
scif
is
located
at
mykotronx
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
these
random
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
unit
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial
numbers
thus
the
unit
keys
are
a
function
of
secret
random
bits
where
each
agent
knows
only
to
generate
the
unit
key
for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce
and
and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to
and
the
second
bits
to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit
key
u
is
the
xor
of
and
and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
as
a
sequence
of
values
for
and
u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial
number
that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second
disk
is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third
disk
contains
the
unit
keys
u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second
disk
thus
each
agent
walks
away
knowing
an
seed
and
the
key
parts
however
the
agent
does
not
know
the
other
bits
used
to
generate
the
keys
or
the
other
key
parts
the
third
disk
is
used
to
program
the
chips
after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the
vault
and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
the
protocol
may
be
changed
slightly
so
that
four
people
are
in
the
room
instead
of

the
first
two
would
provide

that
the

the

i
expect
that

reserves
the
use
of
wiretaps
for
the
most
valuable

the

can
vary

re
secret
algorithm
re
clipper
chip
and
crypto
keyescrow
after
reading
the
debate
over
the
clipper
i
have
a
few
things
to
add
first
most
of
the
people
i
know
who
activly
use
encryption
privately
do
not
care
about
most
of
the
issues
that
surround
this
debate
and
any
questions
about
what
is
or
is
not
ok
to
use
in
the
us
all
they
care
about
is
wether
or
not
what
they
are
using
is
secure
or
not
that
after
all
is
the
bottom
line
second
if
i
look
at
all
the
people
i
know
who
use
any
form
of
encryption
at
all
and
this
group
spans
people
from
the
morons
who
still
insist
that
the
des
is
a
good
and
secure
standard
to
people
looking
at
trying
to
improve
upon
existing
strategies
i
can
not
think
of
anyone
of
them
who
would
approve
blindly
of
a
strategy
that
leaves
their
methods
open
to
abuse
the
clipper
does
this
because
people
make
mistakes
by
nature
and
the
us
government
is
made
up
of
people
who
are
just
as
vulnerable
to
mistakes
as
everyone
else
third
since
most
of
the
people
i
know
are
at
least
marginaly
familiar
with
the
vulnerabilities
present
in
current
software
encryption
stratigies
i
cant
see
how
most
of
them
are
going
to
blindly
trust
that
someone
will
not
figure
out
a
good
way
to
compromise
the
clipper
chip
that
despite
any
strengths
or
weaknesses
that
may
exist
in
it
so
i
can
not
see
a
high
degree
of
confidence
developing
in
the
chip
fourth
when
it
comes
to
criminal
abuse
sure
there
are
many
stupid
people
out
there
and
yes
some
will
be
open
to
being
caught
via
the
built
in
back
door
of
the
clipper
chip
however
anyone
who
is
going
to
do
any
serious
investigation
of
how
best
to
secure
their
data
is
going
to
run
into
that
problem
pretty
damned
fast
and
i
would
assume
start
looking
around
for
other
easily
obtainible
methods
of
encryption
if
nothing
else
were
avalible
none
of
this
would
be
an
issue
however
the
truth
is
that
most
private
encryption
users
that
ive
ever
run
into
simply
do
not
give
a
damn
about
the
legal
status
of
rsa
or
pgp
or
anything
else
if
it
works
they
use
it
this
is
not
going
to
change
either
i
do
not
think
for
a
moment
that
anyone
with
serious
criminal
intent
will
be
slowed
down
by
the
advent
of
the
clipper
chip
it
is
all
to
easy
to
convert
encrypted
data
into
unintellgible
garbage
as
it
is
if
anything
the
clipper
chip
just
adds
another
tool
to
the
user
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
people
will
use
what
works
and
unavoidibly
im
sure
most
criminals
would
rather
face
an
encryption
related
charge
than
one
which
could
potentialy
lead
to
death
penalty
charges
in
the
case
of
criminals
who
murder
as
part
of
their
conspiricy
the
other
thing
that
has
struck
me
since
the
advent
and
wide
useage
of
public
encryption
has
begun
is
that
quite
simply
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag
or
if
you
have
an
interest
in
snooping
pandoras
box
has
been
opened
and
this
is
not
going
to
change
ive
seen
a
blindness
to
this
that
ive
found
utterly
stunning
and
the
clipper
chip
along
with
the
way
it
has
been

only
confirms

is
twofold
transmit

the

xors
the

this

the

pattern
used

in

correctness

with

whereas
no

proposed
federal

and
because
they
could
recover
it
themselves
the
correctness
of

can
be
tested
by
examining

in

f
the
one
could
selectively
alter
the

as
above
but
the
mutilation
could
be
detected
a
better
approach
would
be
to
mutilate
the
entire
law
enforcement
block
if
it
were
done
with
a
group
encryption
scheme
such
as
des
or
presumably
skipjack
the
chances
the

can
be
recovered
are
lessened
what
do
you
want
to
bet
the
transmission
protocol
can
be
recognized
and
the
serial
numbers
decrypted
in
a
target
search
when
digital
transmission
becomes
widely
available
would
there
be
a
requirement
that
clipper
protocol
transmissions
be
refused
when
containing
mutilated
law
enforcement
blocks
one
way
to
avoid
notice
would
be
to
spoof
protocol
information
of
the
block
containing
m
as
well
as
spoofing
the
law
enforcement
block
the
goal
is
to
use
a
secure
communications
scheme
without
redress
to
detection
or
key
k
interception
contained
encrypted
within
the
law
enforcement
block
the
data
stream
is
returned
to
its
original
state
for
use
by
the
clipper
chip
or
system
if
required
for
proper
operation
it
is
somewhat
improbable
that
the
entire
protocol
will
be
contained
within
the
clipper
chip
yet
likely
that
sequence
of
events
will
be
tested
for
requiring
a
valid
law
enforcement
block
to
be
received
before
accepting
and
decrypting
em
k
the
spoof
chip
could
be
implemented
anywhere
in
the
protocols
including
on
the
resulting
serial
data
stream
existing
clipper
products
could
be
subborned
after
all
they
are
high
security
encryption
systems
right
super

could
allow
the
chip
to
be
used
without
redress
to
detection
of
the
use
of
the
chip
or
disclosure
of
the
serial
number
security
must
be
adequate
to
deny
the
serial
number
which
should
not
be
recoverable
by
other
means
one
can
see
the
use
of
cut
outs
for
procurring
clipper
phones
or
once
the
number
of
units
is
high
enough
stealing
them
it
would
be
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
authority
but
nice
from
a
point
of
privacy
if
the
serial
number
n
were
not
associated
with
a
particular
clipper
chip

of

further
made
difficult
by
altering
the
temporal

spatial

to

super

subject
political
point
of
attack
clipper
infrastructure
my
earlier
argument
that
clipper
will
encourage
state
and
local
cops
to
commit
criminal
acts
is
largely
moot
now
that
weve
learned
that
the
fbi
will
perform
the
actual
tap
it
will
encourage
the
fbi
to
commit
even
more
criminal
acts
but
thats
not
the
point
here
but
this
gives
another
avenue
of
attack
on
the
clipper
proposal
when
the
effaclucpsr
foia
requests
are
made
they
should
ask
for
details
on
the
bureaucratic
and
equipment
infrastructure
that
is
proposed
or
even
already
budgeted
for
the
fbi
to
service
tapping
requests
for
now
and
the
projected
future
from
these
figures
estimate
the
number
of
clippertap
requests
the
fbi
is
expecting
publish
this
figure
compare
it
on
a
percapita
basis
with
the
amount
of
tapping
now
known
or
suspected
also
estimate
how
expensive
it
would
be
for
the
fbi
to
install
more
clippertapping
stations
and
how
rapidly
they
could
be
built
and
installed
ie
get
the
plus
or
minus
epsilon
for
the
near
future
might
be
a
mite
disturbing
for

q
public
to
know

despite

thanks
to
those

still

question
when

and
how
does
the
remote
clipper
chip
handle
it
is
it
transmitted
periodically
in
the

of
encrypted
blocks
or
just
at
the
beginning
does
the
phone
at
the
other
side
discard
those
packets
via
a
protocol
whatsoever
or
tries
it
to
turn
them
into
voiceoutput
which
would
not
be
disturbing
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
these
random
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
unit
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial
numbers
thus
the
unit
keys
are
a
function
of
secret
random
bits
where
each
agent
knows
only
second
question
why
why
is
such
a
strange
procedure
used
and
not
a
real
rng
this
turns
those
in
a
kind
of
bottleneck
for
system
security
when
law
enforcement
has
been
authorized
to
tap
an
encrypted
line
they
will
first
take
the
warrant
to
the
service
provider
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
communications
line
let
us
assume
that
the
tap
is
in
place
and
that
they
have
determined
that
the
line
is
encrypted
with
the
clipper
chip
the
law
enforcement
field
is
first
decrypted
with
the
family
key
f
giving
ek
u
n
documentation
certifying
that
a
tap
has
been
authorized
for
the
party
associated
with
serial
number
n
is
then
sent
eg
via
secure
fax
to
each
of
the
key
escrow
agents
who
return
eg
also
via
secure
fax
and
and
are
xored
together
to
produce
the
unit
key
u
and
ek
u
is
decrypted
to
get
the
session
key
k
finally
the
message
stream
is
decrypted
all
this
will
be
accomplished
through
a
special
black
box
decoder
so
no
technical
provision
will
be
taken
to
place
a
timeout
on
these
warrants
this
would
be
a
unique
possibility
to
realize
such
a
technical
restriction
by
letting
the
escrowagencies
perform
the
decoding
of
the
session
key
just
take
modemlines
instead
of
secure
fax
is
this
such

bad
idea
a
successor
to
the

clinton
last
november
everyone
did
vote
for
a
candidate
who
shares
my
sense
of
urgency
about
fighting
the
drug
menace
the
advocates
of
legalization
the
advocates
of
surrender
may
be
very
good
at
making
noise
clinton
said
but
when
the
american
people
cast
their
ballots
it
only
proved
what
i
knew
all
along
that
the
advocates
of
surrender
are
nothing
more
than
a
microscopic
fringe
just
doing
a
quick
reality
check
here
is
this
for
real
or
did
someone
invent
it
to
provoke
a
reaction
from
people
it
sounds
more
like
the

youd
have

marketing
it
themselves
includes

they
provide

for

produce
varous
bitrates
theres
one
which
gives
pretty
acceptable
voice
quality
at
just
right
for
a

their
dsp
can
play

record
at

too
so
you
wouldnt
need

twowayradio
you
can
also
download

to

though
youd
need

dunno

it

this

enable

theyll
never

note
that
these
have
to

constant

nature

they

i
was
wondering
why
theyll
always
do

in

the
procedure
described
by
ms
denning
imposes
high
costs
on
the

at

three

the

one

has
occurred
to
all

our

demonstrated
itself
to

a

and
yet
the
people
vote
for
these
people
because
they
come
out
a
lie
to
them
about
promising
to
fix
things
the
administration
has
to
be
committed
to
leaving
private
industries
alone
esp
on
this
issue
the

has
no
legitimate
role
in

agencies

be

they
are

inevitably
to

of
it
you
mean
they
might
have
to
go
back
to
actually
working
to
do
their
job
oh
heavens
no
such
laws
can
be
constitutionally
sound
and
this
is
equivalent
to
a
veiled
threat
which
i
dont
appreciate
this
kind
of
extortion
tends
to
agitate
me
and
others
into
radicalism
i
will
trade
threats
for

violation
for

perhaps

first
amendment
definitely
the
second
and
fifth
if
the
administration
did
say
this
it
would
find
itself
impeached
for
reckless
and
outrageous
disregard
of
essential
established
entrenched
and
explicit
constitutional
privacy
guarantees
the
administration
would
have
no
legal
standing
whatsoever
such
an
action
would
be
egregiously
illegal
and
criminal
and
wholly
untolerated
and
disregarded
by
vast
segments
of
the
population
unfortunately
the
vast
segments
of
the
population
are
misinformed
they
just
havent
appended
sr
to
the
name
of
out
country
yet
this
is
an
outright
dingaling
denning
lie
the
two
aims
of
privacy
and
surveillance
are
intrinsically
and
fundamentally
incompatible
and
you
have
to
work
for
the
nsa
to
think
otherwise
americans
are
about
to
discover
ways
through
the
use
of
technology
to
preserve
their
inalienable
but
forgotten
freedoms
that
have
slowly
been
eroded
away
by
an
increasingly
distant
and
unresponsive
and
unrepresentative
government
i
seriously
doubt
that
the
nsa
thinks
that
privacy
and
surveillance
are
compatible
i
doubt
of
any
smart
person
in
any
other
agency
thinks
so
either
the
problem
is
that
they
simply
hold
privacy
to
be
of
no
value

thats

somebody
once
said
something

armed

is
meant

to
be
used
in

to
an

it
is
not

re

it
seems
likely
to
me
that
that
a
large
subset
of
encrypted
communications
would
be
archived
to
tape
so
they
could
be
read
if
sometime
in
the
future
probable
cause
arises
and
a
warrant
is
obtained
i
think
it
is
unlikely
that
data
like
this
could
be
used
in
court
currently
leas
can
install
wiretaps
on
large
numbers
of
phones
record
calls
without
listening
to
them
and
then
postfacto
obtain
warrants
and
listen
to
calls
after
probable
cause
is
established
but
this
strategy
wouldnt
get
the
stuff
admitted
in
court
at
least
not
in
the
near
term
in
other
words
near
as
i
can
tell
the
thing
that
makes
such
evidence
inadmissable
is
the
interception
without
a
warrant
not
the
attempt
to
interpret
what
was
intercepted
without
a
warrant
id
be
surprised
that
archiving
data
without
consent
would
be
interpreted
as
anything
but
analogous
to
a
wiretap
by
the
courts
note
that
that
doesnt
mean
i
think
it
wont
be
done
if
technically
feasible
just
as
im
sure
many
wiretaps
are
done
now
without
warrants
just
to
fish
for
avenues
to
investigate
so
in
the
future
start
surveilance
start
archiving
data
trump
up
some
probable
cause
decrypt
postfacto
after
the
warrant
is
in
hand
and
the
investigation
gets
a
boost
from
data
that
sadly
wont
ever
be
presented
to

dont

folks
its

nobody

leas
with

can
get

by
the
way
well
be

hey
this
is
nothing
new
we
already
have

in

and
teller

dont
we
and
then
well
pass
laws
requiring
cameras
covering
all
public
places
then
in
some
private
places
then
well
make
it
a

ever
to
be

when

posted

i
felt
it
was

clear
things
up
so
expn
and
vrfy
on
csrc
have
always
been
disabled
in

for
reasons
having
nothing

i
posted

at
the
request

folks
here
because
csrc
also
provides

i
posted
them
from
an

called

i
also
created
an

called

that
contains
the

of
members
of
the

computer

board
set

of
and
addresses
of
other

not
affiliated
with
nist
but
involved
in
cryptography
security
and
privacy
i
believe
that
these
individuals
were
included
on
this
list
because
nist
felt
it
important
to
get
them
the
clipper
information
firsthand
the
clipper
alias
is
there
for
the
benefit
of
those
named
above
it
is
not
a
source
for
information
it
was
set
up
solely
to
monitor
any
initial
traffic
individuals
on
the
list
have
requested
that
they
continue
to
get
traffic
that
is
not
already
duplicated
on
usenet
while
you
can
rightfully
say
we
were
a
bit
disorganized
in
handling
this
i
would
ask
that
people
stop
speculating
about
any
hidden
agendas
or
motives
of
the
individuals
on
the
clipper

ive
already
apologized
to
them
for
whats
happened
disabling
expn

vrfy
is
an
increasingly
common
practice
albeit
unfriendly
to
some

any
effect
of
disabling
it
again

that
att
was
made
known
of
the
clipper
well
before
the
rest
of
the
industry
this
is
for
several
reasons
several
of
which
are
this
is
a
very
good
point
att
obviously
knew
and
participated
in
the
development
of
the
clipper
chip
this
amounts
to
unfair
business
practice
and
gives
att
an
early
monopoly
on
the
market
hopefully
a
nonexistant
market
other
companies
that
compete
with
att
in
the
cellular
market
motorola
nec
etc
have
grounds
to
file
a
complaint
over
this
right
now
the
company
is
afraid
that
the
new
clipper
chip
will
put
them
out
of
business
this
is
a
very
real
possibility
so
they
really
need
help
in
stopping
the
clipper
chip
from
becoming
a
standard
if
you
want
to
contact
them
they
can
be

it
would
seem
that
the
one
fact
that
the
government
has
overlooked
in
this
whole
fiasco
is
the
economic
standpoint
as
others
have
mentioned
the
most
difficulty
the
clipper
chip
faces
is
an
economic
one
lets
face
it
the
average
consumer
doesnt
care
or
know
that
the
clipper
is
a
bad
idea
if
there
is
a
perceived
need
for
cellular
encryption
then
the
companies
will
provide
one
most
likely
a
standard
will
emerge
but
if
the
clipper
is
too
expensive
and
a
chip
is
way
too
much
then
they
will
develope
their
own
or
buy
a
cheaper
one
i
give
sct
my
full
support
and
hope
the
clipper
chip
goes
the
way
of
the
beta
video
tape
format
also
hope
they

reusing

in

of

there
is
of

the
problem
of

the

thing
applies
in

you
cant
patent

declare

you

that

you

somebody
asked

what
was
wrong
about

in

such

the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die

riot
in
a
new
civil
war
not
me
which
is
precisely
why
the

must
be
cut
off
at
the
knees
when
it
pulls
stunts
like
this
lest
the
situation
worsen

the

where

are

key
registering

since
the

it
seems
clear
that
one
of

should
be
under
the
control
of
the
judicial
branch
i
suggest
the
supreme
court
or
regionally
the
courts
of
appeal
more
specifically
the
offices
of
their
clerks
courts
already
operate
substantial
recordkeeping
operations
some
of
these
records
are
confidential
so
the
concept
of
a
court
holding
information
in
confidence
in
accordance
with
law
has
longstanding
legal
precedents
the
judiciary
is
more
immune
to
pressure
from
the
executive
branch
than
any
executive
branch
agency
or
contractor
can
be
so
judicial
control
of
keys
is
appropriate
for
the
other
half
of
the
key
i
suggest
a
unit
of
congress
the
general
accounting
office
the
gao
is
congresss
staff
unit
for
keeping
tabs
on
the
executive
branch
and
has
an
excellent
reputation
its
controlled
strictly
by
congress
the
executive
branch
has
no
authority
over
it
with
keys
split
between
the
legislative
and
judicial
branches
we
might
have
a
chance
of
this
system
working
honestly
if
of
course
a
way
can
be
found
to
keep
the
keys
from
being
siphoned
off
before
they
reach
the
repositories
this
should
not
be
construed
as
an

by
me
of
the
whole

if

i
think
this
is
no
accident
it
comes
from
the
same
philosophy
that
the

rulescontrols
the

not
the
people
controlling
the
government
that
the
unconnected
citizens
are
not
sophisticated
enough
to
know
what
is
best
for
them
so
the
government
must
tell
the
people
what
they
need
or
do
not
need
we
know
best
and
the
idea
that
that
a
commoner
can
defend
himself
against
government
eavesdropping
or
unlawful
attack
is
totally
unacceptable
to
people
with
this
outlook
combine
this
all
with
pushing
for
national
identity
cards
with
smart
chips
to
encode
anything
they
please
internal
passport

the

health

system
and
with
you
can
be

more
jewels
yet
to

one
sees
an
extremely
ominous
trend
so
what
if
will
be
ten
years
late
it
still
is
turning
out
to
be
an
amazingly
accurate
prophecy
unless
a
lot
of
people
wake
up
and
in
a
hurry
one
should
always
have
every
red
warning
light

flag
come
up
when
the
government
seeks
to
set
itself
apart
in

from
the
unconnectedunprivileged
citizen
or
should
we
now
be

instead
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
have
a
good
secure
system
of
data
security
not
dependent
on
nebulous
safeguards
for
maintaining
that
security
why
shouldnt
the
average
person
be
able
to
defend
himself
from
an
agency
gone
rogue
am
sure
the
feds
could
break
into
any
data
they
really
wanted
to
but
it
would
take
some
work
and
using
the
same
logic
one
should
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
good
safe
unless
a
duplicate
of
the

or

dont
really
see
a
difference
philosophically
encrypted

wont
evaporate
not
with

hightech

the
average
amerikan
today
seems
to
think
that
the
government
should
be
able
to
eavesdrop
on
everyone
else
opinion
polls
show
that
most
people
belive
the
bill
of
rights
to
grant
too
much
freedom
to
people
when
it
is
not
identified
as
such
btw
if
anyone
knows
of
a
cite
for
that
id
love
to

it
not
only
does
this
mean
that
these

willing

give
up
everyone
elses
rights
they
dont

the

can
we

some
things
that
i
think
it
implies
of
course
these
could
all
be
wrong
from
the
clipper
chip
a
technical
summary
dorothy
denning
revised
april
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
singlekey
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
takes
clock
ticks
and
in
electronic
codebook
ecb
mode
runs
at
mbits
per
second
each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
this
length
is
subject
to
change
u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages
encrypted
with
the
chip
encrypting
with
the
chip
to
see
how
the
chip
is
used
imagine
that
it
is
embedded
in
the
att
telephone
security
device
as
it
will
be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
an
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
this
key
negotiation
takes
place
without
the
clipper
chip
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
such
as
the
diffiehellman
publickey
distribution
method
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the
conversation
or
message
stream
m
digitized
voice
the
telephone
security
device
feeds
k
and
m
into
the
chip
to
produce
two

the

stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a
law
enforcement
field
which
are
transmitted
over
the
telephone

the
law

field
thus
contains
the
session
key
k
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
u
concatenated
with
the
serial

n
all
encrypted
under
the
family
key
f
the
law
enforcement
field
is
decrypted
by
law
enforcement
after
an
authorized
wiretap
has
been
installed
suppose
i
knew
how
the
algorithm
worked
and
knew
the
n
for
my
chip
but
did
not
know
f
then
by
cryptanalysis
i
might
be
able
to
determine
f
from
if
law
enforcement
field
eek
u
n
f
not

n
would
might
make
this
much
harder
now
suppose
that
i
know
f
either
legitimately
or
not
if
i
know
k
either
because
i
am
involved
in

or
i

for

in

i
may
now
be
able
to
determine
u
for
the
other
party
if
i
know
f
i
can
also
defeat
the
law
enforcement
field
since
i
could
make
my
own
with
a
different
k
then
the
one
i
am
using
knowing
f
also
allows
traffic
analysis
to
be
performed
so
i
might
not
know
what
you
are
saying
but
i
could
know
who
you
are
saying
it
too
now
i
admit
that
someone
trying
to
compute
u
will
not
have
lots
of
messages
to
work
from
but
since
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
key
generation
method
does
not
deliberately
generate
weak
keys
or
for
that
matter
that
the
published
method
is
in
fact
used
perhaps
the
us
will
be
chosen
from
know
weak
keys
for
the
system
obviously
the
compromise
of
f
would
be
a
disaster
both
to
law
enforcement
for
whom
this
whole
thing
is
designed
and
for
the
people
who
believe
that
it

that

if

companies
will
provide
one
most
likely
a
standard
will
emerge
but
if
the
clipper
is
too
expensive
and
a
chip
is
way
too
much
then
they
will
develope
their
own
or
buy
a
cheaper
one
this
is
an
interesting
point
as
a
very
coarse
rule
of
thumb
you
can
figure
that
the
final
price
of
a
product
is
to
times
the
cost
of
goods
the
exact
multiplier
depends
largely
on
economies

i

estimating

would
wiretap
chip
be
costeffective
by
robin
hanson
draft
april
summary
compared
to
an
average
monthly
phone
bill
of
sixty
dollars
wiretaps
are
only
worth
two
cents
a
month
to
police
so
the
proposed
wiretap
chip
must
raise
phone
costs
by
less
than
one
part
in
three
thousand
to
be
costeffective
background
until
now
phones
have
happened
to
allow
the
existence
of
wiretaps
detectors
which
could
pick
up
conversations
on
a
phone
line
and
over
time
law
enforcement
agencies
have
come
to
rely
on
this
capability
to
aid
in
criminal
investigations
however
powerful
new
encryption
technologies
threaten
this
status
quo
by
making
possible
truly
private
communication
a
small
chip
in
each
phone
could
soon
make
it
literally
impossible
to
overhear
a
conversation
without
physical
microphones
at
either
end
in
order
to
preserve
the
ability
of
law
enforcement
agencies
to
tap
phone
conversations
the
us
government
announced
on
april
that
it
had
developed
and
begun
manufacturing
a
special
wiretap
chip
to
be
placed
in
future
phones
instead
of
the
total
privacy
chips
which
have
been
under
private
development
the
same
day
att
announced
it
would
use
these
chips
in
all
its
secure
telephone
products
each
chip
would
be
created
under
government
supervision
when
it
would
be
given
a
fixed
indentifier
and
encryption
key
periodically
during
each
conversation
the
chip
would
broadcast
its
identifier
and
other
info
in
a
special
law
enforcement
block
law
enforcement
officers
with
a
court
order
could
then
obtain
the
key
corresponding
to
the
indentifier
from
special
trust
agencies
and
could
thereby
listen
in
on
any
future
or
previously
recorded
conversations
on
that
phone
to
date
most
concerns
voiced
about
this
plan
have
been
about
its
security
the
government
wont
disclose
the
encryption
algorithm
and
many
suspect
the
government
will
not
limit
its
access
in
the
way
it
has
claimed
the
track
record
of
previous
governments
does
not
inspire
confidence
on
this
point
however
this
paper
will
neglect
these
concerns
and
ask
instead
whether
this
new
wiretap
chip
is
a
costeffective
tool
for
police
investigation
that
is
which
is
a
cheaper
way
for
society
to
investigate
crime
force
phone
communications
to
support
wiretaps
or
give
police
agencies
more
money
to
investigate
crimes
in
other
ways
or
to
put
it
another
way
would
police
agencies
be
willing
to
pay
for
each
wiretap
if
they
had
to
pay
their
share
of
the
full
social
cost
of
forcing
phones
to
support
wiretaps
to
start
to
answer
this
question
we
might
compare
the
current
benefits
wiretaps
provide
to
law
enforcement
agencies
with
projected
costs
of
implementing
the
new
wiretap
chip
plan
and
since
current
benefits
are
easier
to
estimate
we
begin
there
wiretap
benefits
is
the
latest
year
for
which
wiretap
statistics
are
available
in
that
year
wiretap
installations
were
requested
and
no
requests
were
denied
this
figure
does
not
include
wiretaps
obtained
with
the
consent
of
a
party
to
the
conversation
arrests
resulted
from
wiretaps
started
the
same
year
arrests
came
from
wiretaps
in
previous
years
and
of
arrests
led
to
convictions
of
the
wiretaps
were
for
phones
vs
pagers
email
etc
were
regarding
drug
offenses
and
were
requested
by
federal
authorities
each
wiretap
installation
heard
an
average
of
calls
of
them
incriminating
among
people
and
cost
an
average
of
extrapolating
from
the
installations
reporting
costs
mostly
for
labor
thus
a
total
of
about
million
was
spent
on
wiretaps
to
obtain
about
arrests
at
per
arrest
thus
these
arrests
are
at
least
four
times
more
expensive
than
the
per
arrest
figure
one
gets
by
dividing
the
billion
spent
by
all
police
nationally
by
the
total
million
nontraffic
arrests
thus
the
million
per
year
spent
on
phone
taps
is
only
one
thousanth
of
the
total
police
expenditures
and
if
we
divide
this
by
the
million
phone
access
lines
in
the
country
we
get
about
cents
spent
per
year
per
phone
line
or
about
two
cents
a
month
in
general
we
deter
a
given
class
of
criminals
through
a
combination
of
a
perceived
probability
of
being
caught
and
convicted
and
some
expected
punishment
level
if
convicted
so
the
social
value
of
having
wiretaps
is
no
more
than
the
amount
that
we
would
have
to
pay
to
get
the
same
criminal
deterrence
through
other
means
if
unable
to
wiretap
a
particular
suspects
phone
police
might
instead
use
hidden
microphones
or
investigate
that
suspect
in
other
ways
or
police
might
focus
on
suspects
more
easily
investigated
without
wiretaps
or
we
might
raise
the
fine
or
prison
time
for
certain
types
of
crime
if
we
generously
assume
that
these
substitutes
for
wiretaps
would
be
on
average
twice
as
expensive
as
wiretaps
then
the
annual
social
benefit
of
phone
wiretaps
is
about
equal
to
the
current
spending
level
of
two
cents
a
month
per
phone
line
wiretap
costs
let
us
for
the
moment
optimistically
assume
that
the
us
government
encryption
scheme
is
as
secure
as
whatever
private
enterprise
would
have
offered
instead
protecting
our
conversations
from
the
spying
ears
of
neighbors
corporations
and
governments
both
foreign
and
domestic
even
so
the
need
to
support
wiretaps
would
add
many
additional
costs
to
build
and
maintain
our
communication
system
extra
law
enforcement
blocks
would
be
added
to
phone
transmissions
increasing
traffic
by
some
unknown
percentage
a
special
process
must
be
used
to
add
encryption
keys
to
chips
while
securely
distributing
these
keys
to
special
agencies
which
must
be
funded
and
monitored
the
chips
themselves
are
designed
by
a
military
contractor
whose
design
is
to
remain
secret
and
are
manufactured
through
a
special
process
so
that
the
chip
becomes
nearly
impossible
to
take
apart
chips
are
now
offered
at
the
relatively
high
price
of
a
peice
in
lots
of
private
encryption
systems
not
supporting
wiretaps
would
require
none
of
these
extra
costs
perhaps
most
important
government
degree
would
at
least
partially
replace
private
marketplace
evolution
of
standards
for
how
voice
is
to
be
represented
encrypted
and
exchanged
in
our
future
phones
it
is
widely
believed
that
governments
are
less
efficient
than
private
enterprise
in
procuring
products
and
standards
though
they
may
perhaps
perform
a
useful
brokering
role
when
we
choose
between
competing
private
standards
how
much
less
efficient
is
a
matter
of
debate
some
say
they
pay
twice
as
much
while
others
might
say
only
more
currently
a
total
of
billion
is
spent
as
operating
expenses
of
us
phone
companies
which
comes
out
to
about
per
month
per
access
line
if
we
compare
this
to
the
wiretap
value
of
two
cents
per
month
we
see
that
if
wiretaps
raise
average
operating
costs
by
even
as
much
as
one
part
in
then
wiretaps
are
not
cost
effective
and
this
doesnt
even
include
extra
costs
phone
owners
pay
because
their
encryption
chips
are
more
expensive
of
course
most
phones
wouldnt
have
encryption
chips
for
a
while
but
the
wiretap
benefit
per
phone
is
still
the
same
so
this
argument
still
applies
conclusion
given
this
dramatic
difference
between
the
total
cost
of
running
the
phone
system
and
the
value
of
wiretaps
we
can
justify
only
the
slightest
modification
of
the
phone
system
to
accommodate
wiretaps
when
the
only
modification
required
was
to
allow
investigators
in
to
attach
clips
to
phone
wires
wiretap
support
may
have
been
reasonable
but
when
we
consider
substantial
modification
the
burden
of
proof
is
clearly
on
those
proposing
such
modification
to
show
that
the
costs
would
really
be
less
than
the
benefits
if
consensus
cannot
be
obtain
on
this
costbenefit
estimate
a
compromise
might
be
to
tax
phones
which
do
not
support
wiretaps
at
a
rate
of
say
five
cents
per
month
a
tax
payable
to
police
agencies
nationwide
to
compensate
them
for
their

i
have
not

thus
far
in

the

has

i
noticed
a
rather
disturbing
trend
in
some
of
the

ive
tossing
back
and
forth
me
too
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
some
people
to
hide
their
head
in
the
sand
the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a
new
civil

how
many
people
do
you
want

for
their

why
sit

while
the

put
in

by
a
shortsighted

everybody
is
jumping
up

find
out
how
many

i
think
youll
only

i

you

how

thats
not

good
odds
you
are
misinformed
but
this
whole

is
off
the

somebody
once
said
something
like
armed
violence
is
meant
only
to
be
used
in
response
to
an
armed
attack
it
is
not
meant
to
be

in
agression
this
is
the
difference
between
selfdefence
and
murder
when
the

kick

tell
them

thoughts
and
questions
i
just
joined

recently
and
really
do
not
know
much
about
cryptography
but
a
couple
things
came
to
mind
while
reading
through
the
posts
is
the
clipper
chip
going
to
be
exported
if
not
how
will
people
communicate
with
other
countries
will
they
have
to
do
that
in
uncryptmode
will
other
encryption
techniques
be
legal
assuming
the
government
cracks
down
on
using
others
when
going
overseas
but
not
within
the
states
ive
read
about
authentication
systems
that
use
an
electronic
security
card
that
looks
like
a
calculator
to
create
an
encrypted
pin
based
on
the
timedate
the
host
system
has
the
algorithm
built
into
it
as
well
so
that
it
can
authenticate
a
user
is
there
some
form
of
encryption
technology
that
would
create
keys
that
are
only
valid
at
a
certain
instant
in
time
the
systems
would
then
allow
a
window
of
time
around
this
instant
where
the
key
would
work
i
realize
that
this
technique
would
increase
the
amount
of
information
needing
to
be
stored
because
you
would
need
entire
algorithms
rather
than
just
keys
but
for
smaller
scale
things
it
might
work
could
some
similar
method
be
used
to
make
the
two
keys
that
are
issued
to
policefbietc
to
tap
a
phone
only
usable
for
oneweek
for
instance
if
further
surveilance
was
needed
they
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
escrow
service
to
get
another
key
this
would
make
it
useless
for
local
police
to
database
keys
they
have
used
i
assume
this
is
not
possible
because
the
receiving
phone
would
need
to
be
able
to
decypher
the
message
but

thoughts

the

i

i
can

defeat

field
since
i

then
the
one
i

knowing
f

allows

so
i
might
not

what
you

i
could
know

it
too
im
not
sure
therell
be
a
way
to
shove
arbitrary
key

data

but
if
so
this
parts
ok
were
assuming
e
is
unknown
you
can
obviously
shove
arbitrary
data
through
your

as
for
the
key
it
is
stated
that
the
sesion
key
exchange
is
external
to
the
chip
so
i
can
pick
my
keys
too
now
i
admit
that
someone
trying
to
compute
u
will
not
have
lots
of
messages
to
work
from
but
since
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
key
generation
method
does
not
deliberately
generate
weak
keys
or
for
that
matter
that
the
published
method
is
in
fact
used
perhaps
the
us
will
be
chosen
from
know
weak
keys
for
the
system
they
assume
that
you
wont
be
able
to
find
u
no
matter
how
many

you
have
if
they
could

they
wouldnt

escrow
bing
bing

bing
bing
that
exactly
my
point
since
we

the
only
safe
assumption
is
that
they
do
i
admit
that

of

are
probably
unfounded
but
since
we

obviously
the

be

both
to

whom
this
whole

is

and
for

believe

one

that
alot

more
then

if

the

remember
in
the
announcement
they
described
this
scheme
as
balancing
the
two
extremes
of
having
no
privacy
and
claiming
that
citizens
had
a
constitutional
right
to
encryption
so
much

theres
an

about
strong

i
believe
specifically
nor
is
the
us
saying
that
every
american
as
a
matter
of
right
is
entitled
to
an
unbreakable
commercial
encryption
product
every
vendor
claims
his
product
is
unbreakable
so
this
was
sloppy
wording
i
am
not
claiming
that
we
private

should
have

has
been
some

of
our
company
secured

inc
and
on

algorithm
nea
i
spoke
to
craig
at
length
on
and
we
covered
a
lot
of
ground
some
of
the
information
in
the
posting
requires
some
clarification
and
i
would
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
raised
on
scicrypt
sct
is
a
small
company
based
in
silver
spring
maryland
our
two
main
products
at
this
time
are
a
pc
based
secure
communications
program
called
secom
and
a
general
purpose
encryption
chip
which
uses
the
nea
algorithm
developed
for
secom
secom
provides
an
encrypted
secure
communication
link
between
two
pcs
connected
over
dial
up
telephone
lines
it
supports
simultaneous
bidirectional
file
transfer
and
keyboard
to
screen
chat
it
has
its
own
proprietary
communications
protocol
which
is
tightly
integrated
to
the
encryption
all
though
it
is
a
packetized
link
the
data
stream
appears
to
be
continuous
because
the
packet
boundaries
are
hidden
when
secom
was
initially
developed
it
was
implemented
to
use
des
encryption
a
business
decision
was
made
to
seek
export
approval
for
the
product
because
it
was
perceived
that
the
overseas
market
was
a
large
one
and
provided
a
good
marketing
opportunity
we
soon
found
out
that
we
would
never
be
granted
general
export
approval
for
anything
using
des
all
though
the
reason
for
this
was
never
explicitly
stated
it
seems
to
have
something
to
do
with
secret
government
to
government
agreements
which
are
still
in
effect
in
any
event
the
decision
was
made
to
develop
a
new
and
different
algorithm
which
would
take
the
place
of
des
this
was
the
reason
nea
new
encryption
algorithm
was
born
at
this
time
nea
is
being
held
as
a
trade
secret
the
preliminary
work
of
patenting
it
has
begun
and
the
plan
is
to
make
it
public
once
the
patent
process
is
complete
all
though
one
can
make
certain
legal
arguments
for
keeping
it
an
ongoing
secret
i
think
in
the
case
of
an
encryption
algorithm
it
is
necessary
to
let
people
shoot
at
it
over
an
extended
period
of
time
to
prove
its
worth
in
order
to
get
export
approval
for
secomnea
it
was
necessary
to
go
through
nsa
and
to
reveal
to
them
the
details
of
the
program
and
algorithm
this
was
done
only
after
we
had
a
finished
product
to
submit
let
me
state
unequivocally
that
there
is
no
back
door
to
the
program
or
the
algorithm
secured

a
closely

private

no
financial
interest
in
any
way
whatsoever
with
the

or
any
of
the
people
involved
from
a
practical
business
standpoint
we
are
interested
in
selling
chips
and
software
hopefully
in
large
quantities
and
a
back
door
to
the
encryption
if
found
out
could
destroy
our
credibility
and
our
business
with
the
encryption
algorithm
approved
for
export
we
set
out
to
talk
to
a
number
of
potential
customers
for
encryption
products
and
systems
we
were
able
to
identify
several
common
threads
of
functionality
requirements
this
led
to
the
design
of
a
chip
with
the
encryption
algorithm
cast
in
silicon
and
certain
other
capabilities
added
so
that
the
chip
could
fulfill
the
broad
range
of
requirements
that
we
identified
we
are
strongly
opposed
to
the
clippercapstone
chips
in
a
press
release
today
our
president
dr
stephen
bryen
stated
it
seems
as
if
the
government
has
an
unlimited
source
of
funds
to
use
to
push
its
new
bugged
chips
on
the
american
public
but
do
we
not
understand
how
the
national
security
agency
which
is
not
supposed
to
be
involved
in
domestic
spying
can
fund
the
development
of
a
commercial

though

hanging

math

im

ok
andrew
ill
provide
some
evidence
a
friend
of
mine
worked
for
an
electronics
manufacturer
on
with
a
westcoast
office
they
routinely
sold
equipment
to
the
japanese
one
day
the
japanese
started
showing
up
with
discount
demands
that
were
amazingly
close
to
the
cost
to
manufacture
the
products
this
company
routinely
sent
most
of
the
manufacturing
data
to
the
field
offices
the
japanese
had
simply
intercepted
it
so
my
friend
the
computer
systems
admin
came
up
with
a
solution
he
started
sending
the
data
out
doubleblockencrypted
with
des
two
days
after
this
new
distribution
plan
was
implemented
the
president
of
the
company
got
a
visit
from
a
pair
of
government
agents
they
told
him
to
knock
it
off
the
president
gave
in
since
his
company
did
a
considerable
business
with
the
federal
government
now
if
the
government
wasnt
monitoring
the
communications
how
would
they
even
know
that
the
encryption
system
was
installed
further
since
encryp
tion
isnt
illegal
and
des
certainly
isnt
what
is
the
basis
of
the
governments
ceaseanddesist
demand
the
spooks
do
whatever
they

necessary
with

ill

anything
else
the

double

noticed

rather
disturbing
trend

tossing
back
and

somebody
asked
me
what
was
wrong
about
overreacting
in
cases
such
as
this
the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a
new
civil
war
everybody
is
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going
to
reach
for
their
hammers
and
rifles
before
their
pens
and
paper
can
people
work
within
the
system
before
trying
to
break
it
a
circut
court
judge
in
illinois
once
said
when
dealing
with
a
government
that
seeks
continually
new
and
more
creative
ways
to
spy
on
its
citizenry
one
cannot
discourage
the
move
to
empower
the
common
citizen
with
the
means
to
parry
this
attack
on
personal
privacy
unfortunately
the
comment
was
with
regard
to
the
banning
of
radar
detectors
the
point
remains
more
and
more
i
see
the
government
slowly
washing
away
privacy
even
unwittingly
do
you
think
i
will
ever
live
in
a
soceity
that
issues
smart
cards
to
citizens
at
birth
do
you
think
i
will
live
in
a
soceity
that
insists
i
register
my
crypto
keys
so
they
can
keep
track
of
what
im
saying
even
if
there
is
no
evidence
of
my
guilt
do
you
think
i
will
ever
live
in
a
soceity
that
seeks
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
its
citizenry
without
recourse
of
any
kind
im
tired
of
it
there
is
imho
no
compromise
with
an
administration
that
seeks
to
implement
these
proposals
under
the
guise
of
enhancing
privacy
more
than
the
proposals
themselves
i
read
the
language
of
the
press
releases
the
obvious
deception
involved
in
presenting
these
pieces
to
the
public
and
i
am
sickened
i
am
revolted
i
am
repulsed
perhaps
even
of
this
country
could
care
less
about
the
clipper
chip
the
wiretap
bill
the
smart
card
because
they
are
so
entrapped
in
the
rhetoric
of
the
clinton
administration
this
saddens
and
frightens
me
i
am
a
conserveative
believe
it
or
not
a
law
and
order
conserveative
but
the
move
to
a
centralized
authoratarian
regime
really
scares
me
mostly
because
i
know
you
cant
go
far
wrong
underestimating
the
intelligence
of
the
american
people
tell
them
its
going
to
keep
them
safe
from
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
and
they
will
let
you
put
cameras
in
their
home
even
in
the
wake
of
waco
you
find
those
who
support
the
increasingly
totalatarian
moves
somebody
once
said
something
like
armed
violence
is
meant
only
to
be
used
in
response
to
an
armed
attack
it
is
not
meant
to
be
used
in
agression
this
is
the
difference
between
selfdefence
and
murder
to
be
quite
honest
the
way
things
are
going
id
call
it
self

eh
theres
enough
blood
shed

without
adding
a

can
record

warrant
and
get

just
like
they
would
the

to

etc
lets
say
i
suspect
that
there
is
a
way
to
trivially
crack
this
at
the

with
no

say
for

scanning

and
the

has
abused
great

in

so
i
say
mr

i
want
something
different
independent
i
am
a
paranoid
sort
ya
understand
will
the
result
be
sorry
without
government
permission
we
cannot
sell
you
anything
secure
or
would
it
be
sorry
we
know
which
side
our
bread
is
buttered
on
we
cannot
sell
except
to
government
people
law
enforcement
and
special
people
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
the
chances
of
sure
we
will
sell
you
this

be
happy
to
also
please
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
us
what
the
plans
are
for
private
encryption
of
say
files
transferred
by
modem
or
ftp
or
data
stored
on

surely
you
have
a
feel
for
what
the
administration
is
planning
for
us
people
on
that
with
your
rather
intimate
relationship
with
the
fbi
nsa
etc
you
must
certainly
have
an
idea
you
are
surely
not
going
to
say
the
people
are
not
to
know
until
it
is
too
late
this
is
supposed
to
be
government
of

by

isnt
it
that
is
the
people
are
the

bosses
the
bosses
want
to
know
what
the
is
going
on
here
you
see
i
am
kind
of
nervous
because
in
the
last
month
or
so
i
have
seen
a
nonstop
stream
of
ideas
coming
out
of
wash
dc
that
at
least
appear
very
strongly
to
have
a
common
trait
to
limit
privacy
freedom
from
govt
eavesdropping
and
the
ability
to
defend
ourselves
against
violent
attack
no
is
not
good
enough
for
common
folk
they
arrive
only
in
time
to
clean
up
the
mess
i
would
be
dead
if
i
had
to
depend
on
you
see
with
all
that
talk
about
national
smart
id
cards
limiting
of
encryption
to
government
approved
denial
of
means
to
effective
personal
defense
eight
bills
in
congress
right
now
it
looks
an
awfully
lot
like
the
whole
thing
is
to
be
able
to
trace
every
activity
of
an
individual
from
cradle
to
grave
all
it
would
take
is
requiring
that
national
id
card
to
be
used
in
all
transactions
and
with
no
effective
data
protection
and
with
the
people
suitably
disarmed
there
would
not
be
a
helluva
lot
they
could
do
about
it
now
would
there
all
in
the
name
of
the
war
on
the
constitu

drugs
and
of
course
that
catch
word
terrorists
what
is
wrong
with
good
oldfashioned
police
work
to
build
a
case
they
dont
want
to
have
to
be
burdened
to
leave
the
office
it
seems
please
read
the
bill
of
rights
first
ten
amendments
to
the
us
constitution
and
tell
us
how
you
can
reconcile
this
big
brotherish
policy
of
the
administration
always
for
a
crisis
of
some
kind
isnt
it
with
that
bill
of
rights
in
the
context
of
the
people
who
wrote
it
reassure
us
please
or
is
that
no
longer
regarded
as
necessary
seeing
as
apparantly
the
people
have
no
input
on
this
agenda
the
administration
preferring
to
make
all
the
decisions
in
secret
then
springing
it
on
us
doesnt
sound
much
like
by
the
people
to
me
i
cannot
help
notice
that
the
congress
people
involved
were
not
mentioned
on
the
press
release
i
find
that
more
than
a
little
bit
curious
dont
you
i
sure
would
like
to
know
who
to
not
vote
for
come
election
time
yes
i
am
upset
i
feel
you
are
a
part
of
this
because
i
recall
it
was
you
that
was
posting
heavily
in
favor
of
a
very
similar
idea
could
have
been
the
same
thing
it
was
so
close
a
few
months
ago
i
also
recall
it
was
not
well
received
apparantly
powersthatbe
really
didnt
care
or
were
not
told
or
both
from
what
i
see
clipper
will
only
be
useful
for
conversations
i
dont
want
the
neighborhood
kid
listening
in
on
any
serious
security
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
trust
it
a
bit
might
as
well
use
cleartext
certainly
corporations
would
be
rather
dumb
to
depend
on
this
for
serious
tradesecret
data
especially
if
millions
depended
on
that
security
given
enough
money
one
could
buy
any
keys
they
wanted
buy
a
crooked
judge
and
a
crooked
cop
given
a
few
hundred
thou
they
wouldnt
be
hard
to
find
so
we
end
up
with
only
criminals
terrorists
and
the
government
with
real
security
and
the
ability
to
eavesdrop
you
know
the
first
two
if
they
are
serious
aint
going
to
use
this
thing
for
their
communications
i
bet
the
government
wont
either
except
perhaps
to
order
a
pizza
tell
us
will
that
be
prima
face
evidence
of
criminal
activity
someone
not
using
the
government
approved
methods
that
just
a
desire
to
have
privacy
is
no
longer
regarded
as
a
legitimate
right
of
an
unconnected
citizen
will
that
be
grounds
for
a
flythroughthedoor
raid
and
confiscation
of
all
ones
equipment
as
terrorist
tools
using
civil
forfeiture
so
there
will
be
no
inconvenient
need
to
prove
any
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
citizen
i
have
yet
another
question
are
we
going
to
see
articles
in
all
the
public
magazines
consisting
of
soothing
text
telling
us
how
great
this
is
how
nice
the
government
is
by
letting
us
have
this
illusion
of
privacy
that
the
government
is
going
to
be
so
kind
as
to
let
us
sort

exercise
a

point
i

the

look
for
ways

attacking

that
require
three

formed
in

odd
way
where
do
the
constant

that
are
concatenated
with

come
from
are
they
changed
from

even
if
theyre

if
skipjack
is
resistant

when

theres
no
break

but
why
allow
that
kind
of
weird
format
if
those
three

are
trulyrandom

then
maybe
its

to
ensure
that
a

cant

he
could

he
had

not

i
believe
the

was
possible
because

all

is
essentially
a

the

the

agent
enters
a
secret

these
random

serve
as

to

routinely
sold

to

one
day
the

started
showing

were
amazingly
close

cost
to

the

this

routinely
sent
most

to

offices
the

had
simply
intercepted
it
so
my
friend
the
computer

admin
came
up
with
a
solution
he
started
sending
the
data
out
doubleblockencrypted
with
des
two
days
after
this
new
distribution
plan
was
implemented
the
president
of
the
company
got
a
visit
from
a
pair
of
government
agents
they
told
him
to
knock
it
off
the
president
gave
in
since
his
company
did
a
considerable
business
with
the
federal
government
now
if
the
government
wasnt
monitoring
the
communications
how
would
they
even
know
that
the
encryption
system
was
installed
further
since
encryp

isnt
illegal
and
des
certainly
isnt
what
is
the
basis
of
the

demand
something
similar
has
happened
to
me
ages
ago
when
we
were
working
on
pgp
we
used
to
send
short
messages
about
development
issues
or
simply
to
test
new

around
now
at

pgp
and
certainly
the
newer

was
unknown
over
here
suddenly
the
admin
at
the
site
i
was
using
received
a
request
that
i
stop
sending
encrypted
email
now
there
is
almost
no
way
that
some
automatic
scanner
could
have
found
this
since
they
wouldnt
have
known
about
pgp
they
must
have
checked
for
unknown
data
types
in
the
message
tried
to
unscramble
it
found
they
couldnt
get
past
the
pem
armour
part
and
then
contacted
the
sysadmin
and
asked
me
to
stop
luckily
the
current
email
carriers
are
less
picky
about
what
goes
over
their

in
case
people
think
email
scanning
doesnt
take
place
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
done
regularly
by
many

usually
not
by

i
noticed
a
rather
disturbing
trend
in
some
of
the
email
and
posts
ive
tossing
back
and
forth
me
too
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
some
people
to
hide
their
head
in
the
sand
i
never
advocated
hiding
in
the
sand
im
advocating
a
peaceful
solution
while
a
peaceful
solution
is
possible
unless
you
want
blood
on
your
hands
how
many
people
do
you
want
jailed
for
their
convictions
for
their
insistence
on
real
privacy
why
sit
by
quietly
while
the
preconditions
for
a
real
civil
war
are
put
in
place
by
a
shortsighted
government
read
the
above
everybody
is
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going

reach

thats
not
very
good
odds
you
are
misinformed
but
this
whole

is
off
the

actually
i
consider
the
issue
on

when
you
start
gambling
with
fire
crackers
sooner
or
later
somebody
is
going
to
lose
a
hand
when
the
cops
kick
in
your

for
using
pgp
tell
them
that
all
were
doing
here
is
exercising
our
socalled
rapidly
narrowing
right
to

fine
exercise
the
right
to
free
speech
thats
great
but
dont
resort
to
armed
violence
until
theres
no
other
possibility
perhaps
you
should
talk
to
the
government
about
that
or
are
you
a

of

the

are

there

there

of

did
his
best

uphold

he

have
also
seen
what
happens

cryptography
is
a
spontaneous
invention
of
private
human

and
has
been
going
on
for
thousands
of
years
teenage
slang
and
cipher
inventions
provide
a
modern
example
of
this
spontaneous
creation
the
systems
people
created
on
their
own
were
roughly
as
secure
as
and
sometimes
more
secure
than
those
used
by
military
and
diplomatic
users
of
that
time
although
they
seem
very
simple
and
insecure
today
eg
in

the
bible
used
a
more
complex
simple
substitution
than

i

the
aclu

come
to
mind
was
safeguarding
half

both
the
aclu

the

are
resistent
to

pressure
by
the
simple
expedient
fact
that
they
are
not
supported
funded
or
overtly
controlled
by
the
government
thats
one
problem
that
has
so
far
been
overlooked
these
two
escrow
agencies
will
have
to
create
a
secure
database
and
service
the
input
and
output
of
keys
who
pays
for
this
if
they
refuse
an
illegal
request
from
some
congressman
to
deliver
a
key
can
their
budget
by
cut
to
punish
them
will
congress
be
forced
to
fund
them
forever
the
problem
is
that
laws
can
change
congress
may
pass
a
law
setting
up
an
escrow
agency
with
instructions
that
keys
are
private
some
future
congress
may
change
that
law
suppose
prenazi
germany
had
a
clipper
system
do
you
think
the
escrow
agencies
would
have
told
hitler
that
he
could
not
have
the
keys
without
a
valid
court
order
in
effect
you
must
set
up
escrow
agencies
as
a
fourth
branch
of
the
goverment
and
isolate
them
from
any
outside
interferance
they
will
be
able
to
directly
tap

a
person
i
know
belonging
to
a
research
lab
of
a
rivate
company
claimed
to
me
during
a
priavte
conversation
that
given
the
equipment
in
his
lab
he
could
crack
a
kerberos
ticket
in
minutes
to
an
hour
he
had
access
to
rather
powerful
des
hardware
but
not
of
an
extraordinare
kind
i
believe
the
attack
was
possible
because
of
the
amount
of
known
plaintext
in
the
ticket
which
itself
constitutes
a
small
message
this
was
two
years
ago
des
is
no
longer
usable
for
encryption
of
really
sensitive
data
for
a
lot
of
purposes
however
it
is
still
very
adequate
this
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
a
passwordguesser
not
a
weakness
in
des
merritt
and
i
pointed
out
this
weakness
in
kerberos
in
a
paper
that
came
out
about
years
ago
in
both
computer
communications
review
and
usenix
for
that
matter
it
was
loudly
discussed
on
the
kerberos
mailing
list
even
earlier
the
problem
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
des
and
everything
to
do
with
bad
password
selection
im
perfectly
willing
to
believe
that
there
are
cryptanalytic
attacks
possible
on
des
im
quite
dubious
that
private
research
labs
know
them
and
the
parameters
of
a
bruteforce
attack
are
quite
well
established
see
for
example
the
garon
and
outerbridge
paper
in
the
july
cryptologia
youre
not
going

it
in

hour

rather
powerful
des
hardware
ill
leave
the
arithmetic
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
on
average
youll
need
to
do
trials
pick
your
own
parameters

back

so
each

can
practice
cracking
them
i
would
like
to
start
with

ceasers
ciphers
and
progress
roughly
according

i

years
now
clintons
actions
so
far
have
really
helped
but
because
of
government
action
taken
against
various
other
groups
i
have
developed
a
bit
des
based
on
public
literature
to
protect
my
mailing
list
the
sboxes
are
the
critical
component
and
since
i
chose
out
of
based
on
the
key
cracking
this
des
is
going
to
tough
the
reason
it
slows
you
down
a
touch
is
that
for
each
key
you
try
you
need
to
use
a
different
set
of
sboxes
i
know
its
only
a
vector
but
it
sure
makes
random
search
a
pain
several
marijuana
legalization
groups
have
had
their
mailing
lists
confiscated
when
people
were
charged
with
drug
usesales
its
not
a
crime
to
be
a
member
of
a
legalization
org
but
you
will
be
watched
it
really
is
important
to
write
a
letter
to
every
official
you
personally
vote
for
to
explain
why
your
privacy
is
being
destroyed
by
the
cripple
chip
amazingly
enough
they
do
listen
when
they
get
enough
mail
the
doonsbery
jokes
about
nra
postcards
are
real
and
the
imi
illinois
marijuana
initiative
has
grown
to
the
point
where
we
are
seeing
some
changes
its
pretty
clear
that
all
the
hullabaloo
is
really
about
the
implimentation
decision
being
made
behind
our
backs
as
vesselin
points
out
this
was
common
practice
in
communist
regimes
and
may
be
again
depending
on
how
the
vote
goes
but
just
as
criminals
have
guns
and
law
abiding
citizens
dont
and
criminals
like
me
have
marijuana
and
law
abiding
subjects
dont
criminals
like
me
will
have
secure
crypto
while
law
abiding
robots
dont
pgp
is
nice
but
as
time
goes
on
we
all
can
do
better
and
to
save
our
hides
we
will
someone
posted
an
excerpt
from
machiavelli
hes
my
favorite
dude
years
ago
he
saw
clearly
how
people
are
and
tried
to
explain
that
to
princes
who
wanted
people
to
obey
one
section
not
quoted
ive
got
the
prince
at
home
so
ill
just
paraphrase
had
to
do
with
conquring
a
free
city
the
only
way
is
to
completly
destroy
it
failing
that
you
must
appoint
locals
to
high
positions
and
accept
the
peoples
customs
even
after
years
of
oppression
a
people
will
remember
their
heratige
and
rise
up
to
overthrow
the
oppresive
government
and
he
gave
an
example
and
that
was
years
before
thomas
jefferson
there
were
questions
about
watching
traffic
only
interesting
traffic
is
watched
stuff
that
goes
overseas
and
comes
back
stuff
with
keywords
like
marijauana
cryptography
nsa
certain
individuals
who
are
known
subversives
etc
it
is
easy
enough
to
store
all
that
traffic
so
if
you
know
how
to
be
subversive
ie
how
to
be
unseen
its
pretty
easy
to
go
unnoticed
for
a
long
time
the
stronger
your
crypto
system
and
the
less
youre
noticed
the
better
your
chances
of
developing
an
organization
which
can
diseminate
truth
to
the
masses
which
gets
me
to
the
thread
about
a
public
encrypted
conference
thats
just
silly
the
first
thing
the
feds
do
is
send
in
an
infiltrator
like
dave
s
and
they
know
what
youre
doing
it
will
be
fun
for
teenagers
and
college
students
but
for
the
real
world
its
pretty
pointless
crypto
is
useful
for
more
things
than
hiding
where
you
get
your
marijuana
guns
drugs
and
crypto
do
have
some
commonality
there
are
people
in
government
who
want
you
to
obey
their
rules
as
lundquist
says
in
altdrugs
live
free
or
dont
machiavelli
pointed
out
thats
just
how
most
people
actually
live
inspite
of
appearences
to
the
contrary
its
true
that
the
decision
to
shove
the
clipper
not
the
same
thing
as
intergraphs
down
our
throats
violates
the
principles
of
what
the
us
was
founded
on
but
the
government
is
full
of
idiotic
robots
called
bureaucrats
and
theres
less
to
worry
about
than
one
might
think
only
really
innocent
read
naive
subjects
of
the
us
will
be
hurt
by
this
the

de

out

the

something

has
happened
to
me
ages

when
we
were
working
on

we
used
to
send
short

about
development
issues
or
simply
to
test
new

around
now
at
this

pgp
and
certainly
the
newer

was
unknown
over
here
suddenly
the
admin
at
the

i
was
using
received
a
request
that
i
stop
sending
encrypted
email
now
there
is
almost
no
way
that
some
automatic
scanner
could
have
found
this
since
they
wouldnt
have
known
about
pgp
they
must
have
checked
for
unknown
data
types
in
the
message
tried
to
unscramble
it
found
they
couldnt
get
past
the
pem

part
and
then
contacted
the
sysadmin
and
asked
me
to
stop
luckily
the
current
email
carriers
are
less
picky
about
what
goes
over

this

u
an

imagine

as
it

be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
an
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
this
key
negotiation
takes
place
without
the
clipper
chip
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
such
as
the
diffiehellman
publickey
distribution
method
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the
conversation
or
message
stream
m
digitized
voice
the
telephone
security
device
feeds
k

into
the

produce

stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a

field
which
are
transmitted
over

the

thus
contains

f
the

is
decrypted
by
law

after
an

been
installed
one
very
interesting
thing
i
notice
about
this
is
that
the
only
use
of
the
chip
key
is
to
encode
the
session
key
for
the
law
enforcement
field
it
is
not
used
at
all
by
the
encryption
algorithm
it
seems
like
it
would
be
possible
to
create
a
device
that
would
be
otherwise
compatible
but
would
send
out
a
bogus
law
enforcement
field
this
might
render
the
device
unusable
with
normal
devices
if
theres
some
sort
of
validation
involving
the
law
enforcement
field
but
it
could
certainly
be
used
with
other
such
modified
devices
of
course
this
is
irrelevant
if
the
nsa
has
a
backdoor
in
the
algorithm
but
it
does
make
it
possible

summary
responses
research
on
oracle
password
security
my
original
post
was
i
am
building
an
oracle
database
to
serve
as
a
repository
for
information
which
is
considered
proprietary
or
confidential
as
such
i
want
to
verify
the
security
of
oracle
passwords
and
apply
some
of
the
same
security
checking
techniques
we
use
on
our
nix
systems
specifically
i
would
like
to
use
crack
or
something
like
it
to
check
the
encrypted
data
for
easily
guessed
passwords
the
use
of
crack
would
depend
on
oracle
using
the
unix
password
encryption
scheme
does
anyone
know
if
this
is
the
case
or
what
method
is
used
any
other
methods
for
security
checking
audit
in
the
oracle
environment
would
be
much
appreciated
this
article
will
just
scratch
the
surface
of
a
few
security
considerations
comments
are
requested
email
fwworldstdcom
my
thanks
to
the
people
who
responded
both
on
usenet
and
from
oracle
corp
the
most
common
response
was
to
suggest
use
of
oracle
audit
features
or
ops
passwords
to
control
access
opinion
on
ops
included
suggestions
to
use
and
not
use
i
was
also
advised
to
use
table
views
to
refine
the
granularity
of
access
control
one
important
security
consideration
in
networked
installations
is
that
ops
accounts
presume
that
the
client
host
provides
user
authentication
server
ops
users
are
only
as
secure
as
the
least
secure
machine
on
the
network
hence
you
should
probably
not
define
any
ops
accounts
on
systems
with
pcs
or
limit
access
of
ops
accounts
to
data
with
no
security
concerns
unix
oracle
servers
provide
for
disabling
ops
access
over
the
network
orasrv
option
while
relying
on
host
security
for
local
processes
internally
oracle
provides
powerful
and
well
documented
sic
audit
mechanisms
which
the
dba
will
use
to
monitor
system
and
data
access
these
tools
can
be
used
to
track
the
primary
security
risks
from
within
the
oracle
environment
oracle
password
security
is
based
on
a
proprietary
usage
of
des
encryption
oracle
corp
states
that
the
algorithm
is
not
prone
to
cleartext
attack
this
is
a
difficult
claim
to
substantiate
since
the
algorithm
is
unknown
the
concern
here
is
that
if
users
choose
easily
guessed
passwords
if
a
cracker
can
gain
access
to
your
oracle
database
files
through
the
host
operating
system
she
could
extract
the
cyphertext
password
data
and
apply
cryptanalysis
techniques
to
learn
the
users
passwords
as
security
risks
go
the
above
scenario
is
pretty
low
severity
certainly
once
an
intruder
has
access
to
the
raw
database
files
she
can
access
to
the
data
in
them
if
a
cracker
could
break
the
passwords
however
she
could
do
substantial
damage
without
alerting
the
auditing
mechanisms
and
leaving
and
audit
trail
which
would
point
to
valid
users
at
present
oracle
like
unix
provides
no
native
means
of
ensuring
that
passwords
are
not
guessable
as
with
all
computer
security
the
most
important
defense
is
to
educate
users
in
the
safe
choice
of
passwords
these
techniques
are
well
discussed
in
internet
and
the
crack
manual
both
available
from
ftp
archive
servers
and
unixr

me
that
all

my

is

etc
again
well
they
cant

since
i
already
use
cryptography
for
much
of
my
electronic
mail
and
will
start
using
it
for
my
telephony
as
soon
as
practical
however
allow
me
to
tell
a
parable
there
was
once
a
far
away
land
called
ruritania
and
in
ruritania
there
was
a
strange
phenonmenon
all
the
trees
that
grew
in
ruritainia
were
transparent
now
in
the
days
when
people
had
lived
in
mud
huts
this
had
not
been
a
problem
but
now
hightech
wood
technology
had
been
developed
and
in
the
new
age
of
wood
everyone
in
ruritania
found
that
their
homes
were
all
see
through
now
until
this
point
no
one
ever
thought
of
allowing
the
police
to
spy
on
someones
home
but
the
new
technology
made
this
tempting
this
being
a
civilized
country
however
warrants
were
required
to
use
binoculars
and
watch
someone
in
their
home
the
police
taking
advantage
of
this
would
get
warrants
to
use
binoculars
and
peer
in
to
see
what
was
going
on
occassionally
they
would
use
binoculars
without
a
warrant
but
everyone
pretended
that
this
didnt
happen
one
day
a
smart
man
invented
paint
and
if
you
painted
your
house
suddenly
the
police
couldnt
watch
all
your
actions
at
will
things
would
go
back
to
the
way
they
were
in
the
old
age
completely
private
indignant
the
state
decided
to
try
to
require
that
all
homes
have
video
cameras
installed
in
every
nook
and
cranny
after
all
they
said
with
this
new
development
crime
could
run
rampant
installing
video
cameras
doesnt
mean
that
the
police
get
any
new
capability
they
are
just
keeping
the
old
one
a
wise
man
pointed
out
that
citizens
were
not
obligated
to
make
the
lives
of
the
police
easy
that
the
police
had
survived
all
through
the
mud
hut
age
without
being
able
to
watch
the
citizens
at
will
and
that
ruritania
was
a
civilized
country
where
not
everything
that
was
expedient
was
permitted
for
instance
in
a
neighboring
country
it
had
been
discovered
that
torture
was
an
extremely
effective
way
to
solve
crimes
ruritania
had
banned
this
practice
in
spite
of
its
expedience
indeed
why
have
warrants
at
all
he
asked
if
we
are
interested
only
in
expedience
a
famous
paint
technologist
dorothy
quisling
intervened
however
she
noted
that
people
might
take
photographs
of
children
masturbating
should
the
new
paint
technology
be
widely
deployed
without
safeguards
and
the
law
was
passed
soon
it
was
discovered
that
some
citizens
would
cover
their
mouths
while
speaking
to
each
other
thus
preventing
the
police
from
reading
their
lips
through
the
video
cameras
this
had
to
be
prevented
the
police
said
after
all
it
was
preventing
them
from
conducting
their
lawful
surveilance
the
wise
man
pointed
out
that
the
police
had
never
before
been
allowed
to
listen
in
on
peoples
homes
but
dorothy
quisling
pointed
out
that
people
might
use
this
new
invention
of
covering
their
mouths
with
veils
to
discuss
the
kidnapping
and
mutilation
of
children
no
one
in
the
legislature
wanted
to
be
accused
of
being
in
favor
of
mutilating
children
but
then
again
no
one
wanted
to
interfere
in
peoples
rights
to
wear
what
they
liked
so
a
compromise
was
reached
whereby
all
homes
were
installed
with
microphones
in
each
room
to
accompany
the
video
cameras
the
wise
man
lamented
few
if
any
child
mutilations
had
ever
been
solved
by
the
old
lip
reading
technology
but
it
was
too
late
the
microphones
were
installed
everwhere
however
it
was
discovered
that
this
was
insufficient
to
prevent
citizens
from
hiding
information
from
the
authorities
because
some
of
them
would
cleverly
speak
in
languages
that
the
police
could
not
understand
a
new
law
was
proposed
to
force
all
citizens
to
speak
at
all
times
only
in
ruritanian
and
for
good
measure
to
require
that
they
speak
clearly
and
distinctly
near
the
microphones
after
all
dorothy
quisling
pointed
out
they
might
be
using
the
opportunity
to
speak
in
private
to
mask
terrorist
activities
terrorism
struck
terror
into
everyones
hearts
and
they
rejoiced
at
the
brulliance
of
this
new
law
meanwhile
the
wise
man
talked
one
evening
to
his
friends
on
how
all
of
this
was
making
a
sham
of
the
constitution
of
ruritania
of
which
all
ruritanians
were
proud
why
he
asked
are
we
obligated
to
sacrifice
all
our
freedom
and
privacy
to
make
the
lives
of
the
police
easier
there
isnt
any
real
evidence
that
this
makes
any
big
dent
in
crime
anyway
all
it
does
is
make
our
privacy
forfeit
to
the
state
however
the
wise
man
made
the
mistake
of
saying
this
as
the
law
required
in
ruritanian
clearly
and
distinctly
and
near
a
microphone
soon
the
newly
formed
ruritanian
secret
police
arrived
and
took
him
off
and
got
him
to
confess
by
torturing
him
torture
was
after
all
far
more
efficient
than
the
old
methods
and
had
been
recently
instituted
to
stop
the
recent
wave
of
people
thinking
obscene
thoughts
about
tomatoes
which
dorothy
quisling
noted
was
one
of
the
major
problems
of
the
new
age
of
plenty

joy

glad

lots

however
every

citizen
has
a

allowing

this
has
the
effect
that
it

some

which
it
is

for

dunno
if
youd

you
have
the

nope
talk

a

in

in

the

has
to

try
prevent

anything
you

i

the

i
did

it
is
a

easier
for

to
try

prevent

than
to
charge
someone
with

after

espionage
is
probably
the

exception
note
that
you
need
to
distinguish

if

arent

slightly
overreacting

are
we
all
of

sudden
going
to
draw
parallels
to
nazi

the

that
yes
this

it

not

you

were

the

now
we

you

the

prefer

what

you
live

in

where
a

this

be
a
way

some
of
the

reflect
the

one
will
have
to
hide

somehow
if

away
a
little
perspective
might
be
in
order
the
number
of

wire
taps
is
pretty
low
law
enforcement
has
to
present
pretty
good
evidence
to
get
even
that
limited
number
of
authorizations
thus
the
overwhelming
majority
of
conversations
are
neither
tapped
nor
recorded
by
the
government
and
for
that
to
happen
they
have
to
a
have
a
pretty
good
reason
with
evidence
b
use
this
sparingly
on
highest
priority
pretty
good
reasons
though
the

may
be
imperfect
it
is
a

about

then
after
he
has
digested
this

he
can
ponder
the
fact
that
while
the

does
not
tap
every
conversation
that
they
have
a
record
of
tapping
many
conversations
that
they

operations

collision
should
take
about
operations
no
one
has
found
a
faster
approach
to

or
collision
recent
work
by
den
boer
and
bosselaers
presents
a
special
kind
of
pseudocollision
in
internal
compression
function
which
maps
a
message
block
x
and
a
input
state
s
to
a
output
state
they
show
how
to
find
a
message
block
x
and
two
related
input
states
and
that
yield
the
same
output
state
their
wellthought
approach
exploits
structural
properties
of
the
collision
function
to
find
a
pseudocollision
in
about
operations
much
less
than
one
would
expect
practical
implications
of
this
pseudocollision
work
to
the
security
of
are
not
evident
while
a
real
collision
in
implies
a
pseudocollision
or
a
pseudoinversion
a
pseudocollision
need
not
imply
a
real
collision
indeed
a
real
collision
since
it
involves
two
different
messages
would
almost
always
involve
em
different
message
blocks
and
such
that
but
the
pseudocollisions
have
the
same
message
blocks
moreover
the
input
states
and
would
generally
be
unrelated
but
the
pseudocollisions
input
states
are
the
same
except
for
four
bits
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
way
to
extend
den
boer
and
bosselaers
approach
to
anything
beyond
the
special
pseudocollisions
a
limitation
they
readily
admit
it
is
reasonable
therefore
to
believe
that
remains
secure
while
den
boer
and
bosselaers
have
found
interesting
structural
properties
in
the
properties
seem
only
to
lead
to
special
pseudocollisions
and
not
anything
approaching
real
collisions
further
research
of
course
will
give
a
better
understanding
of
the
strengths
of
and
other

re
suggestions
for
escrow
agencies

re

technical
details
in

david
sternlight
brings
up
the
issue
of
how
the
escrow
agent
will
be
paid
and
the
fact
that
the
government
had
financial
leverage
if
they
dont
cooperate
its
an
important
issue
especially
if
one
of
the
escrow
agents
decides
theyd
rather
stop
offering
the
service
i
assume
that
if
the
escrow
agent
isnt
the
government
then
the
contract
for
providing
escrow
service
would
include
some
termination
clause
like
returning
the
keys
the
easiest
way
is
a
user
fee
for
each
clipper
chip
manufactured
this
makes
the
funding
separate
from
government
but
whos
the
user
paying
the
fees
here
and
whats
the
service
if
the
user
is
the
government
then
the
fundings
not
separate
from
the
government
if
the
user
is
the
buyer
whats
the
service
keeping
the
key
for
me
no
thanks
i
dont
need
and
wont
buy
their
service
not
telling
everybody
my
key
sounds
like
blackmail
if
the
user
is
the
manufacturer
does
the
user
have
a
choice
about
buying
the
alternative
is
to
just
generate
the
key
and
not
escrow
it
which
is
fine
id
certainly
pay
more
for
this
kind
of
key
than
an
escrowed
key
face
it
the
escrow
provider
is
providing
a
service
the
users
dont
want
the
only
people
who
want
it
are
the
government
not
the
users
what
youre
really
talking
about
is
either
the
government
paying
for
the
service
up
front
or
peryear
either
from
general
taxes
or
from
a
special
direct
tax
on
wiretap
chips
or
on
an
indirect
tax
forcing
the
manufacturer
to
pay
the
fee
to
the
escrow
agent
i
hope
the
escrow
people
have
no
way
of
finding
out
your
name
from
your
serial
number
especially
if
the
escrow
is
a
government
agency
here
in
new
jersey
we
have
lots
of
people
willing
to
provide
that
sort
of
services
for
user
fees
there
are
people
willing
to
keep
your
store
from
burning
down
for
a
small
monthly
fee
though
sometimes
people
refuse
to
pay
and
discover
that
the
service
really
was
effective
if
you
go
to
a
baseball
game
at
yankee
stadium
there
are
people
who
will
watch
your
car
in
the

the

is
that
yes

probably
more

shouldnt

difficult
the
celp

is
standardised
we
use
tcpip
streams
and
a
protocol
allowing
silences
to
be
used
to
catch
up
on
any
net
lag
and
also
to
avoid
sending
any
data
during
silences
ie
its
not
wise
to
be

any

the

will
restate
my
assumptions
more
explicitly
and
amplify
my
argument
the
original
title
perhaps
should
have
been
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
cipher
systems
considered
harmful
but
clipper
considered
harmful
is
not
inaccurate
and
is
more
eyecatching
in
the
current
context
assumptions
clipper
is
made
available
laws
are
passed
to
make
use
of
cipher
systems
other
than
clipper
illegal
either
on
radio
systems
or
on
any
common
carrier
system
these
laws
also
include
enforcement
authority
to
listen
across
the
relevant
radio
spectrum
or
other
medium
characterize
signals
validate
clipper
wrappers
detect
probable
use
of
nonclipper
ciphers
and
make
such
detection
a
cause
for
further
action
for
escrowed
keys
to
be
useful
some
specific
clipper
chip
must
be
associated
with
a
suspected
criminal
this
means
that
at
a
minimum
some
association
between
the
common
carriers
unique
phone
id
esn
and
the
clipper

serial

n
will
be
stored
in
a
government
database
an
observed
pairing
of
n
and
esn
other
than
the
one
recorded
raises
a
red
flag
to
reduce
ordinary
fraud
the
cellphone
system
which
offers
clipper
will
also
be
constructed
with
an
esn
mechanism
much
more
tamperproof
and
much
less
spoofable
than
todays
cellphones
criminals
want
inscrutable
communications
some
criminals
are
not
entirely
stupid
or
ignorant
and
will
figure
out
both
that
clipper
cellphones
offer
excellent
security
in
normal
circumstances
and
that
they
offer
no
security
against
law
enforcement
once
a
presumably
legitimate
wiretap
order
exists
they
will
also
figure
out
that
the
wiretap
order
must
necessarily
be
against
a
specific
cellphone
because
each
one
has
a
unique
unit
key
criminals
do
not
want
to
call
attention
to
themselves
because
they
are
not
stupid
or
ignorant
or
because
they
read
netnews
and
because
they
know
that
their
open
use
of
a
nonclipper
cipher
is
likely
to
be
detected
they
will
generally
avoid
using
nonclipper
ciphers
directly
on
some
monitorabletappable
channel
they
know
that
do
so
would
raise
a
red
flag
putting
a
given
cellphone
if
not
a
given
person
under
immediate
suspicion
it
is
impractical
to
reverse
engineer
skipjack
discover
family
key
f
and
construct
a
functional
clone
of
a
clipper
chip
by
and
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
spoof
a
given
clipper
phone
without
immediate
detection
because
it
is
difficult
to
obscure
ones
association
to
a
specific
phone
by
reprogramming
or
changing
chips
around
the
criminal
will
be
motivated
to
find
an
intact
phone
which
is
associated
with
someone
else
a
nonstupid
criminal
will
conclude
that
they
can
have
clippersecure
communications
at
least
for
some
limited
time
t
if
they
buy
beg
borrow
or
steal
use
of
someones
phone
in
a
way
that
prevents
that
person
from
reporting
compromise
of
the
phone
for
at
least
time
t
the
encrypted
communications
might
have
been
recorded
and
thus
be
retrievable
later
but
the
criminal
can
delay
and
quite
likely
evade
discovery
by
destroying
or
abandoning
the
phone
before
t
elapses
it
would
be
unusual
for
an
innocent
person
to
volunteer
use
of
their
clipper
phone
to
someone
else
the
honest
subscriber
doesnt
want
to
pay
someone
elses
bill
and
he
doesnt
want
to
fall
under
suspicion
this
leaves
two
sources
of
clipper
phones
for
criminal
use
coercion
and
collusion
coercion
first
theft
bears
a
relatively
low
risk
but
also
sometimes
a
low
time
until
detection
a
few
minutes
if
a
phone
is
stolen
from
a
car
parked
in
front
of
a
store
a
couple
of
weeks
if
a
phone
is
stolen
from
someone
who
is
away
on
vacation
criminal
commerce
is
likely
to
arise
in
stolen
clipper
phones
with
phones
coming
from
riskinured
poor
criminals
and
cash
coming
from
riskaverse
wealthy
criminals
someone
who
is
extraordinarily
motivated
to
gain
a
day
or
two
of
undetected
communication
like
a
terrorist
could
kill
a
person
or
hold
them
hostage
the
limited
time
before
detection
that
a
coerced
phone
is
useful
means
that
continuing
criminal
enterprises
require
a
continuing
supply
of
freshly
coerced
phones
there
would
also
be
created
a
collusive
commerce
between
relatively
wealthy
criminals
and
ignorant
or
dontcare
patsies
who
need
money
and
who
will
submit
to
being
paid
in
return
for
subscribing
to
clipper
phone
service
for
someone
elses
use
criminals
will
learn
that
it
is
more
to
their
advantage
to
coerce
use
of
a
clipper
cellphone
than
it
is
to
apply
a
nonclipper
cipher
to
a
normal
cellphone
they
will
call
much
less
attention
to
themselves
or
at
least
to
their
stolen
phone
this
way
the
fact
of
a
phones
use
being
coerced
must
first
be
reported
before
it
can
be
identified
as
an
interesting
phone
and
have
its
keys
obtained
from
escrow
clipper
also
allows
an
extraordinary
opportunity
for
the
criminal
to
conceal
use
of
superencryption
an
automated
fullsystem
surveillance
mechanism
quite
feasible
across
radio
bandwidth
which
knows
family
key
f
can
validate
clipper
wrappers
and
nesn
associations
but
it
cannot
reveal
in
realtime
the
use
of
superencryption
unless
it
knows
all
unit
keys
which
we
are
being
assured
are
only
to
be
made
available
in
two
separate
pieces
upon
specific
wiretaplike
order
whereas
a
criminals
use
of
any
cipher
within
a
normally
cleartext
medium
would
stand
out
a
criminals
use
of
a
nonclipper
cipher
within
a
clipper
medium
would
be
very
difficult
to
detect
even
ex
post
facto
in
bulk
recordings
as
long
as
the
association
between
criminal
and
specific
clipper
chip
is
fractured
if
you
make
use
of
this
other
cipher
illegal
per
se
then
you
can
charge
the
criminal
with
this
if
you
can
identify
the
true
criminal
hell
be
using
someone
elses
phone
but
youll
have
no
evidence
to
help
you
against
whatever
traditional
crime
he
might
have
been
planning
you
will
not
even
be
able
to
detect
that
unusual
encrypted
communications
are
occurring
until
you
identify
specific
phones
and
obtain
their
keys
from
escrow
the
gangster
and
terrorist
are
thus
arguably
more
not
less
secure
than
they
were
before
clipper
came
along
i
therefore
consider
clipper
harmful
because
it
does
not
provide
absolute
privacy
to
the
honest
public
against
aggressive
or
dishonest
government
if
other
ciphers
are
proscribed
it
engenders
new
types
of
direct
criminal
threat
to
the
honest
public
it
provides
an
extraordinarily
effective
mechanism
for
criminals
to
hide
their
use
of
some
other
cipher
making
it
more
difficult
than
ever
even
to
gain
notice
that
unusual
communications
are
occurring
and
that
plans
for
some
criminal
act
might
be
in
progress
if
other
ciphers
are
proscribed
lazy
investigators
and
prosecutors
are
more
likely
to
pursue
the
easily
quantifiable
cipheruse
crime
than
they
are
the
traditional
and
directly
harmful
crimes
which
key
escrow
is
claimed
to
help
against
if
other
ciphers
are
proscribed
the
stage
is
set
for
witch
hunting
of
illegal
cipher
use

so
be
it
ah
but
developing

takes
them

since
the

it
seems
clear
that
one
of

should
be
under
the
control
of

suggest
the

the

enough
the
points
raised
about
checking

as
opposed
to
what
is
allegedly
programmed
therein
raise
yet
another
trust
issue
even
if
we
assume
that
these
trusted
agents
are
really
entering
a
wide
range
of
and
seeds
rather
than
using
the
same
one
all
the
time
to
reduce
the
key
search
space
to
bits
i
assume
they
are
not
doing
so
by
picking
up
an
iron
filing
and
poking
it
into
the
circuitry
at
carefully
selected
points
to
encode
data
they
would
presumably
be
punching
numbers
into
a
computer
which
for
all
they
know
could
program
the
chips
in
a
manner
completely
independent
of
the
and
values
they
are
feeding
into
the

are
clearly
the

we
should
assume
they
are

the

is
deterministic
from
the
day
the

is
stamped
on

nope
it
cant
be
trusted
this
is
all
about
two
levels
of
access
the
possibly
honest
key
escrow
that
police
forces
have
to
use
and
ostensibly
the
fbi
and
the
back

that
lets
the

decode
everything
on

re
do
we
need
the

for
cheap
security
there
are
chips
which
perform
the

compressionexpansion
they
cant
be
expensive
because
they
exist
in
many
phones
connected
to
pbxs
or
on
the
pbx
line
cards
as
well
as
in
a
lot
of
equipment
which
compresses
voicegrade
circuits
to
save
the
cost
of
longdistance
leased
or
satellite
circuits
i
cant
remember
the
generic
term
for
these
chips
my
impression
is
that
this
was
a
big
deal
years
ago
but
circuits
have
gotten
so
cheap
that
it
isnt
done
much
now
codecs
they
have
to
get
about
compression
on

to
squeeze
them
down

played

it

its

i
have
some
mucking
about

to
do
before
i
can
put
my

looks
like
the
current
option
is
to
use
a

modem
with

to
do
this

means
two

than
encrypt

on
the
assumption
that
regardless
of
the
lawt
the
government
will
abuse
its
power
and
invade
privacy
as
a
matter
of
practicality
i
do
not
think
your
system
offers
much
hope
for
privacy
first
the
trend
toward
universal
identifiers
is
as
mucha
movement
generated
by
government
or
industrys
desire
to
keep
track
of
all
citizens
as
it
is
by
citizens
seeking
simplicity
and
convenience
in
all
transactions
at
best
your
system
would
benefit
the
sophisticated
and
most
would
opt
for
simplicity
the
poor
and
the
undereducated
would
never
use
or
benefit
from
it
finally
where
theres
a
will
theres
a
way
if
government
wants
to
link
data
bases
it
will
by
law
require
the
disclosure
of
various
individual
pseudonyms
used
by
citizens
or
prohibit
it
for
data
bases
which
the
government
wants
to
link
since
corporations
make
money
by
trading
commercial
lists
with
one
another
they
will
never
adopt
the
system
or
if
it
is
adopted
will
use
fine
printn
contracts
to
permit
selling
various
codes
used
by
their
customers
to
other
firms
the
solution
remains
law
policy
and
consensus
about
limits
on
government
or
corporate
intrusion
into
areas
of
individual
autonomy
technique
can
be
used
to
enforce
that
consensus
or
to
override
it
it
cannot
be
used
as
a
substitute
for
such
consensus

it
just
to

so
why
use

not

whether
this
makes
it
harder
or
easier
to
guess
why

formed
as
they
are
it
would
be
facinating
to
see
the
skipjack
algorithm
to
look
for
ways
of
attacking
it
that
require
three
ciphertext
blocks
formed
in
that
odd
way
where
do
the
constant
values
that
are
concatenated
with
the
serial
number
to
form
come
from
are
they
changed
from
chip

or
session

session
even
if
theyre
published
in
the
ny
times
if
skipjack
is
resistant
to
knownplaintext
attacks
when
using
triple
encryption
then
theres
no
break
in
security
but
why
allow
that
kind
of
weird
format
if
those
three
values
are
trulyrandom
bits
then
maybe
its
used
to
ensure
that
a
knownplaintext
attack
on
skipjack
if
it
exists
cant
be
easily
used
to
derive
and
for
a
whole
production
run
of
these
chips
i
cant
answer
all
our
questions
in
detail
but
i
can
take
a
stab
at
them
the
form
the
operations
that
compute
and
is
of
course
the
famous
triple
encryption
suggested
for
use
with
des
its
much
stronger
than
a
single
encryption
and
has
an
effective
key
length
of
bits
for
reasons
that
were
discussed
when
des
was
first
standardized
a
simple
double
encryption
would
not
have
the
same
strength
triple
encryption
has
been
used
by
ibm
since
more
or
less
the
beginning
to
encrypt
other
keys
its
recommended
for
anything
of
very
high
value
and
i
think
we
can
agree
that
the
ri
and
si
fit
that
description
why
and
well
you
need
different
plaintext
values
i
have
no
idea
if
theyll
be
disclosed
or
not
at
a
guess
theyre
constructed
so
that
they
differ
in
as
many
bit
positions
as
possible
a
goo
cryptosystem
will
scramble
things
a
lot
with
even
a
change
but
the
values
of
n
in
a
series
will
have
fairly
similar
bit
patterns
and
there
might
conceivably
be
a
weakness
so
the
ni
values
are
and
im
guessing
chosen
to
increase
the
hamming
distance
in
any
event
im
quite
convinced
that
one
cannot
go
back
to
the
si
from
the
ui
let
alone
u
observe
if
the
nsa
has
u
they
dont
need
to
find
si
but
even
if
they
do
they
cant
get
and
in
theory
they
should
never
even
see
those
values
even
with
a
warrant
the
real
question
i
think
is
why
use
this
scheme
at
all
as
opposed
to
a
hardware
random
number
generator
my
answer
is
that
this
is
much
more
verifiable
look
suppose
that
nsa
nist
the
aclu
the
eff
and
the
nra
combined
to
build
a
really
good
random
number
generator
and
that
it
passed
every
test
you
could
think
of
when
you
come
back
next
week
to
program
some
more
chips
does
it
still
work
that
well
have
any
components
changed
in
value
have
the
components
been
changed
out
from
under
you
does
it
still
work
well
the
in
the
presence
of
a
focused
microwave
beam
that
tends
to
bias
it
towards
selecting
bits
yes
you
can
run
detailed
statistical
tests
on
it
again
but
thats
hard
consider
on
the
other
hand
a
software
solution
you
bring
your
own
floppies
with
you
you
can
run
cryptographic
checksums
etc
its
a
lot
easier
to
verify
that
the
software
is
unchanged
in
other
words
yes
i
can
think
of
ways
to
cheat
software
too
i
think
that
theyre
a
lot
harder
there
are
three
issues
with
clipper
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
architecture
of
the
whole
scheme
is
capable
of
working
my
answer
with
one
significant
exception
is
yes
i
really
do
think
that
nsa
and
nist
have
designed
this
scheme
about
as
well
as
can
be
assuming
that
their
real
objectives
are
as
stated
to
permit
wiretapping
under
certain
carefullycontrolled
circumstances
with
a
minimum
risk
of
abuse
the
exception
is
that
u
exists
outside
of
the
chip
on
a
programming
diskette
thats
seriously
wrong
and
should
be
loaded
onto
the
chip
separately
to
those
who
disagree
and
i
dont
claim
my
answer
is
obvious
though
i
found
my
own
reasoning
sufficiently
persuasive
that
i
was
forced
to
rewrite
the
conclusions
section
of
my
technical
analysis
paper
i
had
originally
blasted
the
scheme
i
issue
this
invitation
assume
that
you
were
charged
with
implementing
such
a
system
with
complete
regard
for
civil
rights
and
due
process
what
would
you
do
differently
in
answering
this
question
please
accept
nsas
fundamental
assumptions
that
both
strong
cryptography
against
outsiders
and
the
ability
to
wiretap
some
domestic
users
is
necessary
if
you
feel
it
necessary
to
challenge
those
assumptions
do
it
in
the
context
of
the
last
issue
i
present
below
right
here
im
discussing
just
the
technical
aspects
and
no
i
dont
by
any
means
claim
that
just
because
something
can
be
done
it
should
be
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
whole
architecture
is
actually
going
to
be
used
just
because
clipper
chips
are
made
this
way
doesnt
mean
that
thats
the
only
way
theyll
be
made
maybe
the
nsa
will
substitute
its
own
chips
between
the
programming
facility
and
the
shipping
dock
and
theyll
generate
bogus
warrant
requests
so
that
the
escrow
agents
dont
wonder
why
theyve
never
called
sorry
guys
all
them
terrorists
and
drug
dealers
and
pedophiles
seem
to
have
bought
tripledes
phones
instead
whod
a
thunk
it
i
have
no
answer
to
this
question
and
at
the
moment
i
dont
see
a
way
of
answering
it
those
concerns
are
part
of
my
reasoning
in
my
answer
to
the
final
question
below
the
third
and
most
serious
issue
is
whether
or
not
clipper
is
a
good
idea
even
if
carried
out
strictly
according
to
the
letter
of
the
law
i
think
that
the
answer
is
no
but
its
not
a
nobrainer
im
a
civil
libertarian
not
a
libertarian
for
reasons
that
i
explained
at
great
length
on
the
net
in
the
elder
days
and
that
i
dont
have
the
energy
to
repeat
now
but
that
means
that
im
willing
to
accept
that
some
laws
are
necessary
so
long
as
they
respect
the
essential
rights
of
individuals
the
government
already
has
the
ability
and
in
our
system
the
right
to
issue
search
warrants
and
while
that
power
has
certainly
been
abused
its
also
been
used
quite
properly
and
fairly
in
other
cases
is
key
escrow
sufficiently
different
i
think
so
but
again
its
not
an
easy
question
for
me
it
is
easy
for
libertarians
to
answer
of
course
since
clipper
is
completely
alien
to
much
of
the
rest
of
their
oftadmirable
philosophy
and
its
also
easy
for
those
who
give
their
unreserved
trust
to
government

i
would
have
thought
that
by

they
would
have
responded
with
something
of
the
form
well
that
wont
be
a
problem
because
don
alvarez
posted
a
good
partial
solution
to
this
problem
to
comprisks
ill
present
my
variant
on
it
instead
since
i
feel
its
a
bit
stronger
against
some
likely
attempts
to
cheat
depends
on
the
protocol
thats
followed
for
reading
traffic
briefly
the
cops
get
a
wiretap
warrant
and
record
the
call
they
then
notice
the
encryption
and
the
disclosure
header
it
along
with
a
copy
of
their
warrant
is
sent
to
the
fbi
or
whoever
it
is
who
holds
the
family
key
the
fholder
decrypts
the
header
and
sends
the
serial
number
n
and
the
encrypted
session
key
uk
to
the
escrow
agents
they
in
turn
use
and
to
recover
k
and
send
that
to
the
local
police
note
how
this
solves
the
problem
of
wiretapping
forever
neither
the
cops
nor
the
fbi
ever
see
u
so
they
cant
read
other
traffic
every
request
must
be
validated
by
both
the
fbi
and
the
escrow
agents
the
cops
and
the
fbi
together
cant
cheat
since
they
dont
have
u
i
regard
that
as
a
likely
pairing
of
folks
who
might
try
to
beat
the
system
its
to
prevent
this
that
i
modified
alvarezs
scheme
the
escrow
agents
cant
read
the
conversation
since
they
dont
have
it
all
they
have
is
n
and
uk
and
the
police
dont
even
see
n
its
harder
to
see
how
to
block
decryption
of
old
warrantless
wiretaps
there
is
one
protection
you
have
to
persuade
the
escrow
agents
that
the
call
is
current
but
thats
not
nearly
as
strong
there
are
approaches
i
can
see
that
might
work
involving
sequences
of
data
on
an
unalterable
medium
complete
with
cryptographic
protection
against
insertion
onto
a
new
medium
but
i
dont
have
anything
yet
that
isnt
too
complex
for
comfort
or
too
hard

a
long
response
to
the
issue
of
registering
a
phoneclipper
relationship
it
doesnt
wash
recall
that
law
enforcement
gets
a
court
order
to
tap
a
suspects
phone
calls
they
do
what
they
do
nowfigure
out
which
lines
to
tap
they
then
record
the
stuff
if
its
clipper
they
read
the
law
enforcement
block
extract
the
serial
number
and
get
the
keys
using
the
court
order
no
new
difficulties
such
as
using
someone
elses
phone
instrument
or
phone
line
are
introduced
that
wouldnt
have
existed
absent
clipper
if
the
crooks
were
going
to
use
a
pay
phone
say
they
could
have
done
so
without
clipper
if
the
government
figures
out
theyre
so
doing
they
listen
in
and
if
its
a
clipper
conversation
they
get
the
serial
number
and
then
the
keys
if
the
crooks
use
an
innocent
persons
clipper
phone
on
the
tapped
line
theres
no
problem
the
feds
dont
care
whose
phone
instrument
is
used
just
that
the
conversation
is
by
the
suspect
on
the
tapped
line
they
get
the
serial
number
get
the
keys
and
they
are
in
business
no
clipper

is

back

i
think
it
very
unlikely
there
are
back
doors
in

for
two
reasons
the
government
doesnt
need
them
if
it
can
get

and
yes
i
assume
that
the
official
government
obeys
court
orders
etcand
that
the
design
of
the

and
its
approval
were
official
it
would
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
providing
secure
crypto
for
american
business
that
couldnt
be
read
by
our
economic
adversaries
if
this
were
not
a

and
as

why

something
that
no
one
has
discussed
yet
or
i
missed
it
the
fbi
sets
up
a
wiretap
after
the
court
order
was
handed
only
at
this
point
they
can
access
the
line
and
detect
the
serial

n
what
happens
next
does
the
fbi
simply
asks
for
the
keys
for
n
and
since
a
warrant
was
issued
for
the
line
the
fbi
simply
gets
it
what
if
multiple
phones
are
used
from
the
same
house
the
fbi
just
asks
for
etc
exactly
who
is
to
prevent
the
fbi
from
claiming
some
other
serial
number
x
was
also
used
over
the
wirtapped
line
and
get
the

for
x
either
a
second
court
order
for
the
specific
serialkey
is
required
and
i
have
seen
no
indication
of
this
or
the
fbi
can
effectively
ask
for
any
pair
of
keys
at
any
time
so
the
escrow
key
holders
are
a
total
fake
two
safeguards
the
fbi
could
be
asked
to
produce
the
law
enforcement
block
to
the
escrow
agencies
and
associate
it
with
a
particular
court
order
if
the
thing
comes
to
trial
the
defense
attorneys
can
probe
this
issue
closely
it
is
not
too
different
from
proving
that
the
speaker
on
a
legal
wiretap
is
the
person
the
court
order
covered
putting
it
another
way
this
question
is
not
very
different
from
the
preclipper
question
whats
to
prevent
the
fbi
from
getting
a
court

to

knowing

is
believed
by

here
to
break
the

no

more
details
will
emerge
doesnt
matter
if
we
assume
they
are
obeying
the
law
since
they
wont
have
had
a

calls
prior
to

thus
wont

this
is
troubling
it
was
implied
in
the
first
technical
posting
by
dorothy
denning
that
the
fbi
would
do
the
decryption
for
the
law
enforcement
agencies
it
wasnt
clear
to
me
from
the
post
whether
this
would
be
done
in
realtime
or
not
or
whether
the
fbi
would
just
decrypt
the
session
keys
for
the
locals
or
would
do
the
whole
message
one
thing
im
a
bit
puzzled
by
why
arent
they
doing
this
with
a
public
key
scheme
of
some
sort
you
could
generate
two
uniqe
publicprivate
pairsor
for
each
chip
then
escrow
the
private
keys
with
the
escrow
agencies
set
the
protocol
up
to
encrypt
the
session
key
with
both
public
keys
to
decrypt
a
message
both
escrow
agencies
in
the
right
order
for
most
pk
schemes
have
to
decrypt
with
the
escrowed
private

way
there
wouldnt

i
see
now
that
i

the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many

do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a

civil
war
everybody
is
jumping
up

down

screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going
to
reach
for
their
hammers
and
rifles
before
their
pens
and

not
this
bunch
theyll
just
bitch
on

for
a

and
then
go
back
to
lurking
can
people
work
within
the
system
before
trying
to
break
it
examine
your
history
books
and
find
out
how
many
armed
revolutions
led
to
democratic
or
democratic
style
governments
i
think
youll
only
find
one
in
over
five
thousand
years
of
written
history
actually
its
not
quite
that
bad
but
its
close
i
think
everyone
would
just
as
soon
work
within
the
system
the
presence
of
the
possibility
of
using
the
bullet
box
instead
of
the
ballot
box
is
supposed
to
be
a
deterrent
by
keeping
the
price
of
massive
abuse
unacceptable
however
governments
being
what
they
are
sure
would
like
to
remove
that
deterrence
which
will
make
the
need
for
armed
citizens
all
the
more
great
you
dont
need
em
till
you
dont
have
em
then
i
think
we
can
be
more
accurately
called
subjects
instead
of
citizens
the
idea
of
the
people
being
sovereign
over
the
government
is
sure
not
in
vogue
in
the
beltway
these
days
that
is
for
sure
the
administration
is
saying
we
know
best
we
will
tell
you
what
you
need
or
dont
need
after
that
oldfashioned
anachronism
called
the
bill
of
rights
is
not
needed
in
these
enlightened
times
look
we
collectively
have
the
power
to
throw
the
bums
out
but
we
dont
use
it
we
clearly
dont
need
to
go
burning
things
down
but
we
not
if
the
government
has
its
way
there
are
eight
bills
before
congress
that
will
either
ban
tax
exhorbitantly
or
register
all
useful
weapons
in
the
hands
of
the

subject
can
you
say
just

a

of
cartridges
for

one
of
the
current
administrations
top
priority
items
is
to
disarm
all
who
are
not
wellconnected
or
that
work
for
the
government
clearly
do
need
to
throw
at
least
some
of
the
bums
out
unfortunately
the
bums
have
learned
to
target
only
small
groups
of
people
at
a
single
time
so
the
masses
wont
react
and
throw
them
out
eventually
the
masses
will
react
unless
the
bums
cease
their
relentless
encroachment
on
liberty
and
despoilment
of
the
economy
the
sooner
it

the
less
the

live

either
i
want

see

what
would
you
do

fundamental

strong

the

is
necessary
ill
accept
the
second
assumption
only
for
the
sake
of
argument
in
my
view
the
primary
remaining
flaw
is
that
the
encryption
algorithm
is
secret
leading
to
suspicion
that
there
is
a
back
door
without
complete
disclosure
this
suspicion
cannot
be
dispelled
no
matter
how
many
trusted
experts
are
allowed
to
look
at
it
in
isolation
is
it
possible
to
do
this
whole
thing
with
a
public
algorithm
the
only
concern
ive
seen
with
making
skipjack
public
is
that
someone
could
build
clipperphones
without
registering
the
keys
assume
f
can
really
be
kept
secret
as
the
government
assumes
then
as
part
of
the
initial
connection
a
clipperphone
executes
a
protocol
with
the
pseudophone
to
demonstrate
that
they
both
know
f
for
example
the
initiating
phone
picks
a
number
q
and
sends
eq
f
the
receiver
sends
back
f
and
the
initiator
sends
back
f
to
demonstrate
that
her
first
packet
wasnt
just
a
random
block
repeat
in
the
opposite
direction
with
another
q
so
it
cant
be
defeated
by
somebody
building
up
a
library
of
sequential
numbers
by
remembering
responses
and
using
those
responses
as
the
initial
numbers
of
subsequent
challenges
this
way
clipperphones
will
talk
only
to
other
clipperphones
of
course
the
pseudo
company
can
build
their
own
proprietary
skipjack
phone
but
the
presidential
fact
sheet
implies
that
they
wont
get
approval
for
it
without
equivalent
key
escrow
whats
wrong
with
this
picture
it
depends
of
f
staying
secret
and
on
skipjack
being
resistant
to
cryptanalysis
but
the
government
appears
to
believe
in
both
of
these
even
if
the
particular
qa
i
suggest
has
some
flaw
i
imagine
theres
a
zeroknowledgeproof
protocol
that
doesnt
smb
says
the
third
and
most
serious
issue
is
whether
or
not
clipper
is
a
good
idea
even
if
carried
out
strictly
according
to
the
letter
of

how
to
escrow
if
escrowing
were

there

description
of
something
called
a
fair
crypto
system
in
the
may
issue
of
byte
p
attributed
to
mit
professor
silvio
micali
the
way
it
works
is
as
follows
you
generate
your
private
key
s
and
break
it
up
into
pieces
and
such
that
mod
p
s
you
give
each
piece
etc
to
a
different
escrow
agency
the
agencies
each
compute
gsn
mod
p
and
forward
the
result
to
the
public
key
telephone
book
keeper
the
public
key
telephone
book
keeper
multiplies
all
the
gsn
mod
p
reduces
the
result
to
mod
p
and
this
will
be
the
users
public
key
now
if
there
were
several
hundered
recognized
escrow
agencies
and
the
user
could
give
a
piece
of
the
key
to
each
of
the
ones
he
trusted
the
result
would
be
something
of
an
improvement
over
the
proposed
clipper
system
i
still
dont
think
key
escrow
is
a
good
idea
for
both
philosophical
and
security
reasons
but
i
do
offer
this
suggestion
simply
to
determine
whether
escrow
advocates
are
at
all
interested
in
considering
alternatives
in
good
faith
or
whether
the
goal
is
to
insure
the
use
of
only
two
agencies
selected
for
spinelessness
in
the
face
of
official
requests

clipper
phone

theres
no

the

dont
care
whose
phone
instrument
is
used
just
that
the
conversation
is
by
the
suspect
on

they
get
the
serial
number
get
the

and
they
are
in

no
clipper

is
ever

yeah
but
who
wants
to
start
a
pool
on
the
first
person
arrested
mistakenly
and
has
their
life
turned
upsidedown
because
some
law
enforcement
agency
does
make
a
chipperson
association
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
plans
to
keep
these
records
eg
encode
the
serial
number
into
the
upc
scanned
at
kmart
along
with
the
credit
card
info
voila
at
least
your
phone
number
tends
to
only
locate
to
your
house
or
whatever
ie
to
be
coming
from
your
telephone
number
the
person
likely
is
in
your
house
etc
plus
or
minus
some
shenanigans
of
course
but
id
hate
to
think
of
these
guys
getting
the
clipper
id
recording
the
conversation
then
doing
a
quick
crosslookup
and
your
name
comes
up
as
owner
of
that
id
mistakenly
maybe
you
sold
the
phone
at
a
garage
sale
or
the
phone
was
stolen
from
your
car
or
whatever
they
might
only
know
who
one
side
of
the
conversation
is
for
example
anyone
who
thinks
the
govt
is
forbidden
by
law
to
crosscorrelate
such
databases
loses
two
points
first
law
enforcement
agencies
can
of
course
do
this
second
theyre
only
forbidden
from
budgeting
any
money
for
it
the
irs
for
example
does
do
this
anyhow
they
just
dont
spend
any
money
on
it
so
its
technically
legal
i
guess
instead
they
probably
trade
little
favors
with
companies
like
mastercard
if
youre
the
irs
ill
bet
you
have
a
lot
of
opportunities
to
trade
favors
with
major
corps
for
their

i

is
that

are
chosen

by

of
the

escrow
companies
at

that
basing

algorithm
provides
an
inprinciple
checkable
way
to
verify
that
no
back
doors
exist
in
the
choice
of
the
random
numbers
used
to
generate
the
keys
since
we
have
to
trust
the
escrow
companies
anyway
it
does
not
weaken
the
system
to
have
the
keys
be
generated
from
random
seeds
entered
by
the
escrow
agents
and
since
the
algorithm
for
keygeneration
is
public
modulo
skipjack
secrecy
then
in
principle
an
agent
could
challenge
the
procedure
ask
for
and
to
be
exposed

run
his

the
basic
idea
behind
any
communications
security
system
is
not
to
absolutely
deny
access
but
to
make
access
more
expensive
in
time
money
manpower
than
it
is
worth
true
of
all

i
think
and
it
is
the

i

yesterday

that

ouch
thanks
for

i
question
whether
celp
is
the
best
approach
for
this

it
produces
great

at
the

of
tremendous

we
want
something
that
can

even

my

is
that
some

is
going

be
a

yes
im

i
read

releases
the
obvious

involved

perhaps
even
of

could
care
less
about
the

the
wiretap
bill
the

because
they
are
so
entrapped

the

is
the
people
are
not
having
the
scope
or
implicataions
pointed

hell
most
havent
even
heard

when
they
do
it
will
be

telling

how
nice
the

is
at
letting
them

how
come
the

is
not
telling
about
the
provisions
of
the

the
provisions
of
the

the
abuses

the

polls
to
support
percent
of
the
people
want
gun
bans
etc
yet
the
same
pollsters
have
determined
according
to
the
media
that
percent
of
the
people
are
unaware
of
what
the
holocaust
is
the
people
cannot
be
expected
to
give
decent
decisions
when
they
are
denied
the
information
that
all
these
abuses
and
whittling
away
of
rights
are
going
on
quietly
when
they
find
out
when
it
hits
them
it
will
be
too
late
one
cannot
expect
each

all
their

probing
searching
researching
etc
for
example
how
big
a

of
the

even

way
less

i
bet
how
many
outside

are
even
aware

what
big

is
doing
or
have
been
exposed
to
arguments
of
both

what
the

will
get
is
only
one
side
the

side
that
is
scary
this
saddens

frightens
me
i

it

the
move

me
mostly
because
i
know
you
cant
go
far
wrong
underestimating
the
intelligence
of
the
american
people
tell
them
its
going
to
keep
them
safe
from
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
and
they
will
let
you
put
cameras
in
their
home
how
can
the
bulk
of
the
people
be
informed
when
the
media
refuses
to
do
it
even
in
the

of

you
find
those
who
support
the
increasingly
totalatarian
moves
somebody
once
said
something
like
armed
violence
is
meant
only
to
be
used
in
response
to
an
armed
attack
it
is
not
meant
to
be
used
in
agression
this
is
the
difference
between
selfdefence
and
murder
to
be
quite
honest
the
way
things
are
going
id
call
it
self

i
tried
this
code
yesterday
on
my
sparcstation
elc
it
takes
over
seconds
to
compress
seconds
worth
of
speech
this
means
that
it
needs
to
be
optimized
by
over
a
factor
of
before
it
will
be
usable
in
even
a
halfduplex
mode
ouch
thanks
for
trying
it
the
following
program
is
a
very
quick
hack
i
created
a
few
months
ago
to
determine
whether
a
sun
sparcstation
ipc
could
perform
realtime
fullduplex
encrypted
audio
with
resulting
data
rates
sustainable
by
todays
modems
this
test
program
reads
linearlyencoded
audio
from
the
audio
device
compresses
it
with
gsm
compresses
frames
of
samples
recorded
at
into
bits
resulting
in
a
hz
frame
rate
encrypts
it
with
des
then
reverses
the
process
and
sends
the
reconstructed
audio
back
to
the
audio
device
the
compressed
encrypted
audio
stream
is
kbitss
my
sparcstation
ipc
not
exactly
a
very
fast
machine
these
days
certainly
slower
than
an
elc
would
just
barely
sustain
this
activity
audio
underruns
would
occcur
but
the
speech
was
very
intelligible
i
ran
it
as
a
realtime
process
to
get
the
best
results
remember
though
that
this
program
is
a
quick
hack
and
the
performance
can
certainly
be
improved
the
audio
compression
routines
can
be

dear
secretary
brown
as
you
know
i
have
long
been
interested
in
the
privacy
and
security
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
data
in
a
networked
environment
recent
reports
concerning
the
administrations
endorsement
of
an
electronic
encryption
standard
based
upon
clipper
chip
technology
have
raised
a
number
of
related
issues
the
international
competitiveness
of
us
high
tech
manufacturers
and
the
software
industry
is
a
key
factor
that
the
government
should
consider
when
addressing
issues
of
encryption
and
data
security
as
the
nation
moves
forward
in
developing
the
national
communications
and
information
infrastructure
security
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
network
data
will
be
an
increasingly
important
factor
for
protecting
the
privacy
of
users
the
hacker
community
can
compromise
the
integrity
of
telecommunications
transmissions
and
databases
linked
by
the
network
the
people
and
businesses
that
use
the
nations
telecommunications
network
and
the
personal
computers
linked
through
it
increasingly
are
demanding
that
information
be
protected
against
unauthorized
access
alteration
and
theft
i
am
concerned
that
the
administrations
plan
may
mean
that
to
remain
competitive
internationally
us
companies
would
be
compelled
to
develop
two
products
one
for
us
government
customers
and
another
for
private
commercial
users
who
may
want
a
higher
encryption
standard
this
may
inadvertently
increase
costs
to
those
us
companies
hoping
to
serve
both
markets
to
assist
the
subcommittees
analysis
of
this
issue
please
respond
to
the
following
questions
has
the
encryption
algorithm
or
standard
endorsed
by
the
administration
been
tested
by
any
entity
other
than
nsa
nist
or
the
vendor
if
so
please
identify
such
entities
and
the
nature
of
testing
performed
if
not
please
describe
any
plans
to
have
the
algorithm
tested
by
outside
experts
and
how
such
experts
will
be
chosen
under
the
administrations
plan
what
entities
will
be
the
holders
of
the
keys
to
decrypt
scrambled
data
what
procedures
or
criteria
will
the
administration
utilize
to
designate
such
key
holders
does
the
encryption
algorithm
endorsed
by
the
administration
contain
a
trap
door
or
back
door
which
could
allow
an
agency
or
entity
of
the
federal
government
to
crack
the
code
it
is
clear
that
over
time
changes
in
technologies
used
for
communications
will
require
new
techniques
and
additional
equipment
how
will
encryption
devices
adapt
to
the
rapid
advancement
of
telecommunications
technology
what
additional
costs
would
the

place

domestic

takes
them
beyond

we
oppose

i
urge

to
take
the
very

start

repost
it

let

evolve

what
is
wrong
with
the
clipper
chip
by
usenet
users
it
is
secret
how
can
we
trust
the
escrow
agencies
it
is
not
costeffective
we
want
other
encryption
systems
the
government
seems
to
want
to
disallow
it
in
the
future
anyone
can
build
a
nonkey
system
we
are
worried
about
a
back
door
once
everyone
uses
a
clipper
chip
the
mechanism
for
a
bigbrother
government
is
in
place
a
change
of
government
can
lead
to
it
especially
since
the
escrow
agencies
operation
is
not
governed
by
law
so
the
president
can
change
the
rules
to
allow
free
access
to
the
keys
at
any
time
eg
during
war
few
criminals
are
caught
by
wiretaps
the
cost
and
risks
are
unjustified
once
the
fbi
get
hold
of
a
key
it
can
decrypt
past
and
future

since
many

quieter
im

this
doesnt
work
either
we
can
pick

most
of
the

useless
the
description
turns
out

a

assertion

than
an
engineering
one
we

there
might

was

expensive

which
was

built

its

commercial
interest
was
exactly
zero
in
the
absence
of

standards
a
monitor
which
really
is
low

costs

more
cant
compete

a

claims

ok
i
should
have
read
the
thread
before
posting
my
own
i
would
just
add
to
phils
very
infomative
discussion
the
following
caveat
the
fifth
amendment
applies
only
in
crinial
cases
nor
shall
any
person
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
maybe
you
are
using
the
wrong
amendment
if
someone
were
to
seize
a
safe
containing
your
paper
records
and
demand
that
you
produce
the
combination
the
applicable
defense
would
be
on
grounds
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
the
police
would
be
entitled
to
subpoena
documents
relating
to
a
specific
matter
but
any
broad
search
such
as
implied
by
impounding
all
your
records
would
be
unconstitutional
in
the
case
of
the
safe
they
would
probably
get
a
locksmith
and
assert
that
they
only
examined
documents
covered
by
the
warrent
sure
in
the
cryptographic
case
their
only
resort
would
be
rubberhose
cryptography
this
would
also
make
a
good
mental
experiment
to
use
in
choosing
escrow
agents
would
you
trust
this
proposed
agent
with
a

your

second
question
why
why
is
such
a
strange
procedure
used
and
not
a
real
rng
this
turns
those
in
a
kind
of
bottleneck
for
system
security
the
only
theory
that
makes
any
sense
is
that
and
are
either
the
same
for
all
chips
or
vary
among
very
few
possibilities
so
that
anyone
trying
to
break
the

by
brute
force
need
only
plow
through
the
possible
serial
numbers
about
one
billion
multiplied
by
the
number
of

combinations
suppose
instead
that
and
can

given

of
the

generated
in

through
some
sort
of

attack

suppose
further
that
or
of
the

programmed
in
each

never
find
their
way
into
commercial
products
but
instead
end
up
elsewhere
suppose
the
folks
at
elsewhere
can
determine
a
unit
key
given
physical
access
to
one
of
these
chips
then
those
same
folks
can
determine
and
for
the
whole
batch
too
many
suppositions

probably

re

is
it
realistic
for
the

to
try
to
keep
the
details
of
the

secret
if
it
intends
to
use

from

wont

attorneys
attempt

is

re

handle
conference

depending

so
long
as

has

i
was
using
vat
which
is
an

tool
for
a
conference
call
and
we
were
encrypting
the

unfortunately
one

was
doing
more
work
and
didnt
have
the
cpu
for
it
so
it
didnt
sound
all
that
good
at
a

you
would
have
to
use
something
other
than
the

black

in

i
dont
think
public
key
would
work
the
session
key
would
have
to
be
agreed

glenn
thanks
for

that
i
was
surprised
to
notice
however
that
one
question
i
might
have
expected
to
be
asked
was
not
are
all
forms
of
strong

other
than
the
clipper
to
be
made
illegal
speaking
of
which
is
anyone
aware
of
whether
that
question
has
been
asked
of
any
knowledgeable
or
official
spokesperson
for
the
government
i
have
not
yet
seen
it
mentioned
in
any
of
a
dozen
places
it
might
have
been
reported
but
i
could
have
easily
missed
it
please
let
us
know
if
you
get
a
solid
answer
to
the
question
of
legality
of
other
strong
cryptosystems
so
far
any
references
i
have
seen
have
been
weaselwords
more
plans
in
the
future
etc
but
nothing
that
could
be
taken
as
a
no
strong
crypto
will
not
be
outlawed
i
have
heard
not
verified
that
the
crime
bill
before
congress
has
language
that
either
requires
escrow
of
keys
or
that
will
regard
all
systems
unapproved
for
public
use
like
strong
cryptosystems
not
trivially
broken
by
the
govt
or
without
escrowed
keys
which
one
cannot
readily
change
read
use
being
only
permitted
by
folks
with
special
connections
or
government
agencies
as
either
terrorist
tools
or
drug
dealers
tools
not
outlawed
specifically
but
by
added
civil
forfeiture
powers
and
clever
wording
effectively
outlawed
for
all
intents
and
purposes
now
for
some
idle
speculation
for
those
who
dont
care
hit
n
now
crypto
being
effectively
outlawed
could
be
done
without
specifically
outlawing
any
class
of
crypto
systems
for
example
a
crowbar
hammers
screwdrivers
and
such
can
be
regarded
as
burglar
tools
pretty
much
at
the
whim
of
the
authorities
based
primarily
on
the
individual
possessing
them
in
the
car
etc
not
being
in
a
trade
that
makes
routine
use
of
these
tools
in
a
like
manner
one
who
has
no
legitimate
need
govt
definition
for
strong
crypto
software
or
systems
and
is
caught
using
them
might
find
themselves
in
possession
of
terrorist
tools
in
other
words
if
one
is
not
working
for
a
corporation
with
extremely
sensitive
commercial
data
that
warrants
in
the
feds
opinion
strong
security
or
a
government
agency
and
securing
only
workrelated
data
not
personal
data
one
will
most
likely
be
nailed
on
this
if
discoverd
a
personal
desire
for
privacy
most
certainly
will
not
be
regarded
as
a
legitimate
need
why
do
you
want
such
strong
security
especially
from
legitimate
law
enforcement
an
individual
with
legitimate
endeavors
would
not
be
so
concerned
government
is
not
in
the
business
of
revealing
your
personal
secrets
to
the
public
so
you
must
be
trying
to
conceal
or
planning
to
conceal
some
unlawful
or
criminal
activity
do
you
have
something
to
hide
hmmmm
i
expect
that
initially
there
will
be
some
people
selected
either
at
random
or
who
happen
to
have
been
troublemakers
for
the
purposes
of
making
an
example
for
those
who
think
the
feds
are
not
serious
about
this
mega
s
one
asking
about
a
right
to
privacy
will
probably
get
a
response
that
there
is
no
constitutional
right
for
privacy
spelled
out
as
such
an
argument
used
in
the
abortion
debate
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
have
security
that
legitimate
law
enforcement
cannot
break
as
suggested
in
the
clipper
press
release
this
in
a
nutshell
is
what
i
find
so
extremely
frightening
not
only
for
crypto
systems
as
in
this
case
but
for
the
precident
it
will
set
laying
the
groundwork
for
future
erosions
of
privacy
escrow
of
both
safedeposit
box
keys
master
keys
or
combinations
for
privately
owned
safes
and
so
on
why
not
i
cannot
think
of
a
better
way
to
make
an
endrun
around
those
inconvenient
parts
of
the
us
constitution
a
law
cannot
be
easily
declared
unconstitutional
if
it
there
is
no
specific
law
it
would
simply
be
a
minor
extension
of
the
rico
statutes
or
wod
policies
a
simple
policy
decision
just
like
so
many
of
the
gun
regulations
are
mainly
batf
policy
decisions
the
conversation
of
the
fed
agents
would
go
something
like
we
are
gonna
seize
your
home
your
computers
your
car
your
bank
account
you
dont
have
to
undress
and
give
us
yer
clothes
unless
you
have
a
floppy
in
yer
pocket
because
they
are
all
connected
with
your
acquisition
transport
and
use
of
terrorist
tools
andor
drug
dealers
tools
part
of
the
wod
or
against
terrorism
ya
unnerstand
no
decent
american
subject
would
be
against
these
noble
causes
note
we
are
not
accusing
you
of
any
wrongdoing
we
are
only
saying
your
home
computers
car
bank
assets
are
connected
with
wrongdoing
somehow
they
housed
transported
and
funded
these
terrorist
tools
only
a
civil
matter
hehheh
we
had
this
tipgrin
therefore
the
constitutional
protection
on
individual
rights
do
not
apply
we
are
arresting
the
tainted
property
not
youevil
grin
if
you
wish
to
deposit
a
bond
hire
some
attorneys
and
go
to
court
to
prove
the
innocence
of
this
property
that
they
are
not
terrorist
tools
and
again
to
prove
they
are
not
also
drug

go
ahead
we
have
no
problem
with
that
course
with
your

seized
no

computer

probably
no

too
and
your

you
might
run

minor

grin
that
is
what
has
me
going
so
damned
ballistic
it
is
exactly
how
the
logic
goes
when
someone
gives
a
tip
that
your
home
has
been
used
to
store
drugs
note
no
trace
of
drugs
need
to
be
found
on
the
property
only
some
bozo
who
will
say
yup
i
stored
stuff
in
that
dudes
house
probably
to
get
out
of
a
year
sentence
for
dealing
much
more
cost
effective
to
let
him
walk
to
bust
another
day
and
hit
the
jackpot
with
your
assets
ob
disclaimer

ok
note
that
i
am
not
a

can
only

the
thread
why
people
dont

strong

the
atomic

act
of
expressly
forbids
thinking
about
building
nuclear
devices
while
i
was
in
grad
school
a
friend
of
mine
got
a
security
clearance
to
work
on
the
defense
for
the
progressive
magazine
he
found
lots
of
articles
which
were
public
domain
removed
from
the
local
engineering
library
madison
wisconsin
so
the
lawyers
sent
him
all
over
the
states
to
other
libraries
to
show
that
the
information
in
the
article
was
already
public
what
pissed
everyone
off
was
a
local
underground
paper
went
and
published
the
article
anyway
it
had
been
precensored
by
the
feds
thats
what
this
was
all
about
so
the
judge
declared
the
case
moot
the
atomic
energy
act
of
has
never
been
tested
in
court
from
my
discussions
with
several
people
familiar
with
the
case
only
other
times
has
this
preemptive
clause
been
used
in
every
case
the
people
simply
did
what
they
felt
like
and
courts
tossed
the
cases
out
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
government
does
have
precidence
for
declaring
things
classified
after
it
has
been
published
while
i
was
working
on
star
wars
this
happened
to
me
my
clearance
was
in
the
works
and
i
developed
a
method
for
tracking
particle
beams
it
was
good
enough
to
classify
so
i
was
no
longer
allowed
to
work
on
it
a
friend
from
canada
was
in
the
same
boat
he
developed
a
method
to
compute
stripping
cross
sections
but
because
the
subject
was
classified
he
was
not
allowed
to
present
his
own
paper
at
a
conference
he
later
published
it
in
an
open
journal
without
problems
when
the
going
gets
wierd
the
wierd
turn
pro
the
feds
can
do
whatever
they
want
whenever
they
feel
like
it
and
they
will
make
up
rules
to
let
themselves
get
away
with
it
since
the
mass
media
cant
tell
the
difference
between
a
joke
and
the
real
thing
like
ranch
appocolypse
for
the
waco
massacre
dont
count
on
them
to
help
spread
the
word
about
their
loss
of
freedom
the
government
can
make
strong
crypto
illegal
so
what
since
the
government
does
not
obey
any
of
its
own
rules
why
should
we

there
are
three
issues
with

the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
architecture
of
the
whole
scheme
is
capable
of
working
my
answer
with
one
significant
exception
is
yes
i
really
do
think
that
nsa
and
nist
have
designed
this
scheme
about
as
well
as
can
be
assuming
that
their
real
objectives
are
as
stated
to
permit
wiretapping
under
certain
carefullycontrolled
circumstances
with
a
minimum
risk
of
abuse
the
exception
is
that
u
exists
outside
of
the
chip
on
a
programming
diskette
thats
seriously
wrong
and
should
be
loaded
onto
the
chip
separately
to
those
who
disagree
and
i
dont
claim
my
answer
is
obvious
though
i
found
my
own
reasoning
sufficiently
persuasive
that
i
was
forced
to
rewrite
the
conclusions

this

that
you

implementing
such
a
system
with
complete

rights

process
what
would
you
do
differently
in
answering
this
question
please
accept
nsas
fundamental
assumptions
that
both
strong
cryptography
against

the

wiretap
some

he
could
crack

he
had
access

powerful

but
not

i
believe
the

was
possible
because
of
the
amount
of
known
plaintext
in
the

which
itself
constitutes
a
small

this
was
two
years

i
dont

you
and
i
dont

your

why
because
des

not

to
have
any

attacks
readily
availble
unless
your

knows
something
and
is
keeping

he
was
bullshitting
you
now
it
is
possible
that
he
noted
a
weakness
in
the
implementation
of
the
kerberos
protocol
for
instance
using
a
weak

to

might
cut

this

you
are

weakness
in

is
not
known
to
exist
in

dont
get
me
wrong
des
is
weaker
than
it
should
be
however
cracking

requires

the

that

there

you

can
be

to

where
some

replaced
the

and
of
course
the

the

so
that
at

the

have
any
chance
of
getting
the

back
for
those
of
you
who
might
want
to
mangle
the

eg
by
xoring
a

pattern
on

line
and
restore
it
before
feeding
it
into
the

i
would
add
further
encrypted
copies
of
this

perhaps
created
by
repeated
application
of
the
encryption
algorithm
or
so
at
regular
intervals
during
the

if
the
receiving
chip
detects
a
mismatch
it
must
assume
that
the

is
bad
and
it
will
cease
to
work
in
your
own
interest
you
are
protected
from
getting
faulty

you
know
its
just
like

for
your

the

agencies
wont
have
the

which
is

will
be
kept

nothing
prevents

will
do
the

for

and
consistency
checks
on

these

will
turn

the

of

does
depend
only
on
the
secrecy
of
the

the
ability
to
tap
is
an
inherent
insecurity
which
depends
fundamentally
on
the
secrecy
of
the
algorithm
to
spell
it
out
because
so
many
people
seem
to
miss
the
point
if
the
algorithm
were
published
anyone
could
create
a
chip
which
would
work
correctly
with
the
skipjack
chips
but
which
would
not
have
its
key
registered
i
believe
there
is
no
technical
means
of
ensuring
key
escrow
without
the
government
maintaining
a
secret
of
some
kind
for
example
the
secret
could
be
the
private
keys
of
the

agencies
their
digital

would
be
required

thats
one

that

the

that

congress
may

setting

some

congress

suppose
prenazi

you

the

would
have
told

he
could
not

it
will
be

you

you

hence
the

ban
while
the
second
is
under
enough
attack
for
guarrentteing
our

to

perhaps
we
should
reflect
on
this
as
well
perhaps
fire
arms
are
not
the
only
weapons
covered
under
the
second
amendment
hmmm
i
wouldnt
consider
encryption
to
be
a
weapon
how
would
the
government
classify
encryption
seems
to
me
that
encryption
ought
to
be
covered
by
the
first
amendment
using
this
line
of
reasoning
the
government
shouldnt
be
able
to
restrict
what
data
people
encrypt
and
what
encryption
algorithms
they
use
because
this
would
be
restricting
ones
freedom
of
speech
in
other
words
encrypted
datatext
graphics
or
other
informationis
just
another
form
of
free
speech
for
this
reason
the
government
shouldnt
be
able
to
regulate
the
use
of
encryption
algorithms
and
encrypted
data
the
only
time
the
government
should
be
able
to
force
someone
to
reveal
his
or
her
encryption
keys
for
some
encrypted
data
is
when
the
encrypted
data
in
question
may
be
something
that
isnt
protected
by
the
first
amendment
such
as
kiddy
porn
even
in
a
case
like
this
the
government
should
be
required
to
get
a
search
warrant
before
coercing
someone
into
revealing
the
keys
btw
what
encryption
methods
are
considered
to
be
stateoftheart
nowdays
have
the
feds
relaxed
export
restrictions
on
des
yet
also
is

i
have
been
looking
over
the
postings
about
the

chip
and
noticed
an
interesting
omission
from
the
discussion
you
all
mention
that
the
algorithm
is
classified
and
have
expressed
concerns
and
ideas
of
how
to
figure
out
the
algorithm
using
software
the
question
that
i
have
is
why
cant
someone
take
one
of
these
chips
and
reverse
engineer
it
i
mean
take
the
thing
to
a
chip
testing
analysis
facility
one
with
a
decent
electron
microscope
just
pry
off
the
top
of
the
chip
and
start
scanning
it
with
the
electron
microcope
and
figure
out
the
circuitry
i
remembered
a
place
that
i
use
to
work
for
had
one
of
these
facilities
that
they
used
to
analyze
chips
that
we
accidently
blew
out
while
running
tests
they
could
actually
find
the
area
that
was
fried
and
show
us
where
in
the
circuit
it
was
i
am
sure
that
many
companies
and
universities
must
have
these
facilities
and
that
the
potential
is
there
especially
at
a
university
where
the
security
at
such
a
facility
is
looser
for
someone
to
take
a
clipper
apart
and
analyze
it
what
can
the

do

prevent

fill

i
am
writing
you
to
voice
my
strong
opposition
to
president
clintons
clipper
chip
initiative
this
proposal
to
establish
a
secret
government
designed
cryptography
chip
with
government
key
registration
as
the
standard
for
voice
encryption
is
very
disturbing
the
idea
that
citizens
must
register
their
secrets
with
the
government
just
in
case
they
are
trying
to
keep
them
secret
is
patently
unamerican
additionally
the
press
release
for
this
program
strongly
implied
that
other
forms
of
cryptography
would
be
banned
after
the
clipper
chip
standard
is
in
place
this
latest
attack
on
our
civil
rights
is
deeply
disturbing
and
is
frankly
a
voting
issue
for
me
the
presidents
press
release
stated
that
the
plan
strikes
a
balance
between
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
and
a
citizens
right
to
privacy
but
this
is
not
the
case
the
fact
is
that
since
other
strong
cryptographic
equipment
is
avalible
the
criminals
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
mentioned
in
the
press
release
will
simply
use
non
clipper
cryptography
meanwhile
the
average
citizen
may
gain
no
protection
against
warentless
wiretaps
by
the
government
since
the
government
escrowed
key
is
derived
deterministicly
from
the
unit
serial
number
which
is
broadcast
by
the
chip
durring
its

this
seems
like
an
obvious
back
door
for

if

there
seems

so
the

doesnt

for

or
tells

how

what
is
lost
sight
of
is
that
the

are
not

at

because
they

it

a

and
many
are
not

aware

are

so
are
not

to

not

its

just
saying
that
is
the
way
things
are
people
arent
upset
about
things
when
they
arent
told
and
the
less
than
objective

is
a
major
contributer
to
the
problem
and
then
compound
that
with
an
attitude

in

a

for

perhaps
i
am
not
real
eloquent
in

this
but
the
solution
sure
as
hell
is
not
to
make
it
harder
for

dismiss

i

that
mindset
is
a
mistake
before
there

governments
tortured
their
prisoners
with
clubs
and
rubber
hoses
before
there
were

the

lies
not

in

wielder

in

technology
represents
one
of
the
most
promis
ing
avenues
available
for
recapturing
our
freedoms
from
those
who
have
stolen
them
by
its
very
nature
it
favors
the
bright
who
can
put
it
to

over
the
dull
who
can
not
it
favors
the
adaptable
who
are
quick
to
see
the
merit
of
the
new
over
the
sluggish
who
cling
to
time
tested
ways
and
what
two
better
words
are
there
to
de
scribe
government
bureaucracy
than
dull
and
sluggish
one
of
the
clearest
classic
triumphs
of
technology
over
tyranny
i
see
is
the
invention
of
the
manportable
crossbow
with
it
an
untrained
peasant
could
now
reliably
and
lethally
engage
a
target
out
to
fifty
meterseven
if
that
target
were
a
mounted
chainmailed
knight
unlike
the
longbow
which
admittedly
was
more
powerful
and
could
get
off
more
shots
per
unit
time
the
crossbow
required
no
formal
training
to
utilize
whereas
the
longbow
required
elaborate
visual
tactile
and
kinesthetic
coordination
to
achieve
any
degree
of
accuracy
the
wielder
of
a
crossbow
could
simply
put
the
weapon
to
his
shoulder
sight
along
the
arrow
itself
and
be
reasonably
assured
of
hitting
his
tar
get
moreover
since
just
about
the
only
mounted
knights
likely
to
visit
your
average
peasant
would
be
government
soldiers
and
tax
collectors
the
utility
of
the
device
was
plain
with
it
the
common
rabble
could
defend
themselves
not
only
against
one
another
but
against
their
governmental
masters
it
was
the
medieval
equivalent
of
the
armor
piercing
bullet
and
consequently
kings
and
priests
the
medieval
equivalent
of

bureau
of

threatened
death
and
excommunication

for
its
unlawful

looking
at

developments
we
see
how

like
the
firearmparticularly
the
repeating
rifle
and
the
handgun
later
followed
by
the
gatling
gun
and
more
advanced
machine
gunsradically
altered
the
balance
of
interpersonal
and
intergroup
power
not
without
reason
was
the
colt
called
the

a
frail

hostess
with

possession
was
now
fully
able
to
protect
herself
against
the
brawniest
roughneck
in
any
saloon
advertise
ments
for
the
period
also
reflect
the
merchandising
of
the
repeating
cartridge
rifle
by
declaring
that
a
man
on
horseback
armed
with
one
of
these
rifles
simply
cannot
be
captured
and
as
long
as
his
captors
were
relying
upon
flintlocks

first
turned
into
an
integereither
by
using
ascii
or
even
a
simple
representation
this
integer
is
then
raised
to
the
power
x
modulo
pq
and
the
resulting
integer
is
then
sent
as
the
encrypted
message
the
receiver
decrypts
by
taking
this
integer
to
the
secret
power
y
modulo
pq
it
can
be
shown
that
this
process
will
always
yield
the
original
number
started
with
what
makes
this
a
groundbreaking
development
and
why
it
is
called
publickey
cryptography
is
that
i
can
openly
publish
the
product
pq
and
the
number
x
while
keeping
secret
the
number
y
so
that
anyone
can
send
me
an
encrypted
message
namely
x
a
mod
pq
but
only
i
can
recover
the
original
message
a
by
taking
what
they
send
raising
it
to
the
power
y
and
taking
the
result
mod
pq
the
risky
step
meeting
to
exchange
cipher
keys
has
been
eliminated
so
people
who
may
not
even
trust
each
other
enough
to
want
to
meet
may
still
reliably
ex
change
encrypted
messageseach
party
having
selected
and
disseminated
his
own
pq
and
his
x
while
maintaining
the
secrecy
of
his
own
y
another
benefit
of
this
scheme
is
the
notion
of
a
dig
ital
signature
to
enable
one
to
authenticate
the
source
of
a
given
message
normally
if
i
want
to
send
you
a
message
i
raise
my
plaintext
a
to
your
x
and
take
the
result
mod
your
pq
and
send
that
however
if
in
my
message
i
take
the
plaintext
a
and
raise
it
to
my
secret
power
y
take
the
result
mod
my
pq
then
raise
that
result
to
your
x
mod
your
pq
and
send
this
then
even
after
you
have
normally
decrypted
the
message
it
will
still
look
like
garbage
however
if
you
then
raise
it
to
my
public
power
x
and
take
the
result
mod
my
public
pq
so
you
will
not
only
recover
the
ori
ginal
plaintext
message
but
you
will
know
that
no
one
but
i
could
have
sent
it
to
you
since
no
one
else
knows
my
secret
y
and
these
are
the
very
concerns
by
the
way
that
are
to
day
tormenting
the
soviet
union
about
the
whole
question
of
personal
computers
on
the
one
hand
they
recognize
that
american
schoolchildren
are
right
now
growing
up
with
com
puters
as
commonplace
as
sliderules
used
to
bemore
so
in
fact
because
there
are
things
computers
can
do
which
will
interest
and
instruct
and
and
it
is
pre
cisely
these
students
who
one
generation
hence
will
be
going
headtohead
against
their
soviet
counterparts
for
the
soviets
to
hold
back
might
be
a
suicidal
as
continuing
to
teach
swordsmanship
while
your
adversaries
are
learning
ballistics
on
the
other
hand
whatever
else
a
personal
computer
may
be
it
is
also
an
exquisitely
efficient
copying
machinea
floppy
disk
will
hold
upwards
of
words
of
text
and
can
be
copied
in
a
couple
of
minutes
if
this
werent
threatening
enough
the
computer
that
performs
the
copy
can
also
encrypt
the
data
in
a
fashion
that
is
all
but
unbreakable
remember
that
in
soviet
society
publicly
ac
cessible
xerox
machines
are
unknown
the
relatively
few
copying
machines
in
existence
are
controlled
more
inten
sively
than
machine
guns
are
in
the
united
states
now
the
conservative
position
is
that
we
should
not
sell
these
computers
to
the
soviets
because
they
could
use
them
in
weapons
systems
the
liberal
position
is
that
we
should
sell
them
in
the
interests
of
mutual
trade
and
cooperationand
anyway
if
we
dont
make
the
sale
there
will
certainly
be
some
other
nation
willing
to
for
my
part
im
ready
to
suggest
that
the
libertarian
position
should
be
to
give
them
to
the
soviets
for
free
and
if
necessary
make
them
take
them
and
if
that
doesnt
work
load
up
an
blackbird
and
air
drop
them
over
moscow
in
the
middle
of
the
night
paid
for
by
private
sub
scription
of
course
not
taxation
i
confess
that
this
is
not
a
position
that
has
gained
much
support
among
members
of
the
conventional
leftright
political
spectrum
but
af
ter
all
in
the
words
of
one
of
illuminatuss
characters
we
are
political
noneuclideans
the
shortest
distance
to
a
particular
goal
may
not
look
anything
like
what
most
people
would
consider
a
straight
line
taking
a
long
enough
worldview
it
is
arguable
that
breaking
the
soviet
govern
ment
monopoly
on
information
transfer
could
better
lead
to
the
enfeeblement
and
indeed
to
the
ultimate
dissolution
of
the
soviet
empire
than
would
the
production
of
another
dozen
missiles
aimed
at
moscow
but
theres
the
rub
a
long
enough
world
view
does
suggest
that
the
evil
the
oppressive
the
coercive
and
the
simply
stupid
will
get
what
they
deserve
but
whats
not
immediately
clear
is
how
the
rest
of
us
can
escape
being
killed
enslaved
or
pauperized
in
the
process
when
the
liberals
and
other
collectivists
began
to
at
tack
freedom
they
possessed
a
reasonably
stable
healthy
functioning
economy
and
almost
unlimited
time
to
proceed
to
hamstring
and
dismantle
it
a
policy
of
political
gradualism
was
at
least
conceivable
but
now
we
have
patchwork
crazyquilt
economy
held
together
by
baling
wire
and
spit
the
state
not
only
taxes
us
to
feed
the
poor
while
also
inducing
farmers
to
slaughter
milk
cows
and
drive
up
food
pricesit
then
simultaneously
turns
around
and
sub
sidizes
research
into
agricultural
chemicals
designed
to
in
crease
yields
of
milk
from
the
cows
left
alive
or
witness
the
fact
that
a
decline
in
the
price
of
oil
is
considered
as
potentially
frightening
as
a
comparable
increase
a
few
years
ago
when
the
price
went
up
we
were
told
the
economy
risked
collapse
for
for
want
of
energy
the
price
increase
was
called
the
moral
equivalent
of
war
and
the
feds
swung
into
action
for
the
first
time
in
american
history
the
speed
at
which
you
drive
your
car
to
work
in
the
morning
be
came
an
issue
of
federal
concern
now
when
the
price
of
oil
drops
again
we
risk
problems
this
time
because
ameri
can
oil
companies
and
third
world
basketcase
nations
who
sell
oil
may
not
be
able
to
ever
pay
their
debts
to
our
grossly
overextended
banks
the
suggested
panacea
is
that
government
should
now
reraise
the
oil
prices
that
opec
has
lowered
via
a
new
oil
tax
since
the
government
is
seeking
to
raise
oil
prices
to
about
the
same
extent
as
opec
did
what
can
we
call
this
except
the
moral
equivalent
of
civil
warthe
government
against
its
own
people
and
classically
in
international
trade
can
you
imag
ine
any
entity
in
the
world
except
a
government
going
to
court
claiming
that
a
vendor
was
selling
it
goods
too
cheaply
and
demanding
not
only
that
that
naughty
vendor
be
compelled
by
the
court
to
raise
its
prices
but
also
that
it
be
punished
for
the
act
of
lowering
them
in
the
first
place
so
while
the
statists
could
afford
to
take
a
couple
of
hundred
years
to
trash
our
economy
and
our
libertieswe
certainly
cannot
count
on
having
an
equivalent
period
of
stability
in
which
to
reclaim
them
i
contend
that
there
exists
almost
a
black
hole
effect
in
the
evolution
of
nationstates
just
as
in
the
evolution
of
stars
once
free
dom
contracts
beyond
a
certain
minimum
extent
the
state
warps
the
fabric
of
the
political
continuum
about
itself
to
the
degree
that
subsequent
reemergence
of
freedom
becomes
all
but
impossible
a
good
illustration
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
area
of
socalled
welfare
payments
when
those
who
sup
at
the
public
trough
outnumber
and
thus
outvote
those
whose
taxes
must
replenish
the
trough
then
what
possible
choice
has
a
democracy
but
to
perpetuate
and
expand
the
tak
ing
from
the
few
for
the
unearned
benefit
of
the
many
go
down
to
the
nearest
welfare
office
find
just
two
people
on
the
dole
and
recognize
that
between
them
they
form
a
voting
bloc
that
can
forever
outvote
you
on
the
question
of
who
owns
your
lifeand
the
fruits
of
your
lifes
labor
so
essentially
those
who
love
liberty
need
an
edge
of
some
sort
if
were
ultimately
going
to
prevail
we
obvi
ously
cant
use
the
altruists
otherdirectedness
of
work
slave
suffer
sacrifice
so
that
next
generation
of
a
billion
random
strangers
can
live
in
a
better
world
recognize
that
however
immoral
such
an
appeal
might
be
it
is
nonetheless
an
extremely
powerful
one
in
todays
culture
if
you
can
convince
people
to
work
energetically
for
a
cause
caring
only
enough
for
their
personal
welfare
so
as
to
remain
alive
enough
and
healthy
enough
to
continue
workingthen
you
have
a
truly
massive
reservoir
of
energy
to
draw
from
equally
clearly
this
is
just
the
sort
of
ap
peal
which
tautologically
cannot
be
utilized
for
egoistic
or
libertarian
goals
if
i
were
to
stand
up
before
you
tonight
and
say
something
like
listen
follow
me
as
i
enunciate
my
noble
cause
contribute
your
money
to
support
the
cause
give
up
your
free
time
to
work
for
the
cause
strive
selflessly
to
bring
it
about
and
then
after
you
and
your
children
are
dead
maybe
your
childrens
children
will
actu
ally
live
under
egoismyoud
all
think
id
gone
mad
and
of
course
youd
be
right
because
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
libertarianism
andor
egoism
will
be
spread
if
when
and
as
individual
libertarians
andor
egoists
find
it
profitable
andor
enjoyable
to
do
so
and
probably
only
then
while
i
certainly
do
not
disparage
the
concept
of
poli
tical
action
i
dont
believe
that
it
is
the
only
nor
even
necessarily
the
most
costeffective
path
toward
increasing
freedom
in
our
time
consider
that
for
a
fraction
of
the
investment
in
time
money
and
effort
i
might
expend
in
try
ing
to
convince
the
state
to
abolish
wiretapping
and
all
forms
of
censorshipi
can
teach
every
libertarian
whos
in
terested
how
to
use
cryptography
to
abolish
them
unilaterally
there
is
a
maxima
proverbgenerally
attributed
to
the
eskimoes
which
very
likely
most
libertarians
have
al
ready
heard
and
while
you
likely
would
not
quarrel
with
the
saying
you
might
well
feel
that
youve
heard
it
often
enough
already
and
that
it
has
nothing
further
to
teach
us
and
moreover
that
maybe
youre
even
tired
of
hearing
it
i
shall
therefore
repeat
it
now
if
you
give
a
man
a
fish
the
saying
runs
you
feed
him
for
a
day
but
if
you
teach
a
man
how
to
fish
you
feed
him
for
a
lifetime
your
exposure
to
the
quote
was
probably
in
some
sort
of
a
workfare
vs
welfare
context
namely
that
if
you
genuinely
wish
to
help
someone
in
need
you
should
teach
him
how
to
earn
his
sustenance
not
simply
how
to
beg
for
it
and
of
course
this
is
true
if
only
because
the
next
time
he
is
hungry
there
might
not
be
anybody
around
willing
or
even
able
to
give
him
a
fish
whereas
with
the
information
on
how
to
fish
he
is
completely
self
sufficient
but
i
submit
that
this
exhausts
only
the
first
order
content
of
the
quote
and
if
there
were
nothing
further
to
glean
from
it
i
would
have
wasted
your
time
by
citing
it
again
after
all
it
seems
to
have
almost
a
cryptoaltruist
slant
as
though
to
imply
that
we
should
structure
our
ac
tivities
so
as
to
maximize
the
benefits
to
such
hungry
beggars
as
we
may
encounter
but
consider
suppose
this
eskimo
doesnt
know
how
to
fish
but
he
does
know
how
to
hunt
walruses
you
on
the
other
hand
have
often
gone
hungry
while
traveling
thru
walrus
country
because
you
had
no
idea
how
to
catch
the
damn
things
and
they
ate
most
of
the
fish
you
could
catch
and
now
suppose
the
two
of
you
decide
to
exchange
information
bartering
fishing
knowledge
for
hunting
knowledge
well
the
first
thing
to
observe
is
that
a
transaction
of
this
type
categorically
and
unambiguously
refutes
the
marxist
premise
that
every
trade
must
have
a
winner
and
a
loser
the
idea
that
if
one
person
gains
it
must
necessarily
be
at
the
expense
of
another
person
who
loses
clearly
under
this
scenario
such
is
not
the
case
each
party
has
gained
some
thing
he
did
not
have
before
and
neither
has
been
dimin
ished
in
any
way
when
it
comes
to
exchange
of
information
rather
than
material
objects
life
is
no
longer
a
zerosum
game
this
is
an
extremely
powerful
notion
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
the
first
and
second
laws
of
thermodynamicsall
those
laws
which
constrain
our
possi
bilities
in
other
contextsno
longer
bind
us
now
thats
anarchy
or
consider
another
possibility
suppose
this
hungry
eskimo
never
learned
to
fish
because
the
ruler
of
his
nationstate
had
decreed
fishing
illegal
because
fish
contain
dangerous
tiny
bones
and
sometimes
sharp
spines
he
tells
us
the
state
has
decreed
that
their
consumptionand
even
their
possessionare
too
hazardous
to
the
peoples
health
to
be
permitted
even
by
knowledgeable
willing
adults
perhaps
it
is
because
citizens
bodies
are
thought
to
be
government
property
and
therefore
it
is
the
function
of
the
state
to
punish
those
who
improperly
care
for
govern
ment
property
or
perhaps
it
is
because
the
state
gener
ously
extends
to
competent
adults
the
benefits
it
provides
to
children
and
to
the
mentally
ill
namely
a
fulltime
allpervasive
supervisory
conservatorshipso
that
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
with
making
choices
about
behavior
thought
physically
risky
or
morally
naughty
but
in
any
case
you
stare
stupefied
while
your
eskimo
informant
re
lates
how
this
law
is
taken
so
seriously
that
a
friend
of
his
was
recently
imprisoned
for
years
for
the
crime
of
pos
session
of
nine
ounces
of
trout
with
intent
to
distribute
now
you
may
conclude
that
a
society
so
grotesquely
oppressive
as
to
enforce
a
law
of
this
type
is
simply
an
affront
to
the
dignity
of
all
human
beings
you
may
go
far
ther
and
decide
to
commit
some
portion
of
your
discretion
ary
recreational
time
specifically
to
the
task
of
thwarting
this
tyrants
goal
your
rationale
may
be
altruistic
in
the
sense
of
wanting
to
liberate
the
oppressed
or
egoistic
in
the
sense
of
proving
you
can
outsmart
the
oppressoror
very
likely
some
combination
of
these
or
per
haps
even
other
motives
but
since
you
have
zero
desire
to
become
a
martyr
to
your
cause
youre
not
about
to
mount
a
military
campaign
or
even
try
to
run
a
boatload
of
fish
through
the
blockade
however
it
is
here
that
technologyand
in
particular
in
formation
technologycan
multiply
your
efficacy
literally
a
hundredfold
i
say
literally
because
for
a
fraction
of
the
effort
and
virtually
none
of
the
risk
attendant
to
smuggling
in
a
hundred
fish
you
can
quite
readily
produce
a
hundred
xerox
copies
of
fishing
instructions
if
the
tar
geted
government
like
presentday
america
at
least
permits
open
discussion
of
topics
whose
implementation
is
re
stricted
then
that
should
suffice
but
if
the
government
attempts
to
suppress
the
flow
of
information
as
well
then
you
will
have
to
take
a
little
more
effort
and
perhaps
write
your
fishing
manual
on
a
floppy
disk
encrypted
according
to
your
mythical
eskimos
publickey
parameters
but
as
far
as
increasing
realworld
access
to
fish
you
have
made
genuine
nonzero
headwaywhich
may
continue
to
snowball
as
others
redisseminate
the
information
you
have
provided
and
you
have
not
had
to
waste
any
of
your
time
trying
to
convert
id
eological
adversaries
or
even
trying
to
win
over
the
unde
cided
recall
harry
brownes
dictum
from
freedom
in
an
unfree
world
that
the
success
of
any
endeavor
is
in
general
inversely
proportional
to
the
number
of
people
whose
persua
sion
is
necessary
to
its
fulfilment
if
you
look
at
history
you
cannot
deny
that
it
has
been
dramatically
shaped
by
men
with
names
like
washington
lincoln
nixon
marcos
duvalier
khadaffi
and
their
ilk
but
it
has
also
been
shaped
by
people
with
names
like
edison
curie
marconi
tesla
and
wozniak
and
this
latter
shaping
has
been
at

and
not

bloody
and
thats

im
trying

take
the

rather
than
beseeching
the
state
to
please
not
en

plunder
or
constrain
us
i
propose
a
libertarian
net
work
spreading
the
technologies
by
which
we
may
seize
freedom
for
ourselves
but
here
we
must
be
a
bit
careful
while
it
is
not
at
present
illegal
to
encrypt
information
when
government
wants
to
spy
on
you
there
is
no
guarantee
of
what
the
fu
ture
may
hold
there
have
been
bills
introduced
for
exam
ple
which
would
have
made
it
a
crime
to
wear
body
armor
when
government
wants
to
shoot
you
that
is
if
you
were
to
commit
certain
crimes
while
wearing
a
kevlar
vest
then
that
fact
would
constitute
a
separate
federal
crime
of
its
own
this
law
to
my
knowledge
has
not
passed
yet
but
it
does
indicate
how
government
thinks
other
technological
applications
however
do
indeed
pose
legal
risks
we
recognize
for
example
that
anyone
who
helped
a
precivil
war
slave
escape
on
the
underground
railroad
was
making
a
clearly
illegal
use
of
technologyas
the
sovereign
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
at
that
time
found
the
buying
and
selling
of
human
beings
quite
as
acceptable
as
the
buying
and
selling
of
cattle
simi
larly
during
prohibition
anyone
who
used
his
bathtub
to
ferment
yeast
and
sugar
into
the
illegal
psychoactive
drug
alcoholthe
controlled
substance
winewas
using
technol
ogy
in
a
way
that
could
get
him
shot
dead
by
federal
agents
for
his
crimeunfortunately
not
to
be
restored
to
life
when
congress
reversed
itself
and
repermitted
use
of
this
drug
so
to
quote
a
former
president
unindicted
co
conspirator
and
pardoned
felon
let
me
make
one
thing
perfectly
clear
the
libertech
project
does
not
advocate
participate
in
or
conspire
in
the
violation
of
any
lawno
matter
how
oppressive
unconstitutional
or
simply
stupid
such
law
may
be
it
does
engage
in
description
for
educa
tional
and
informational
purposes
only
of
technological
processes
and
some
of
these
processes
like
flying
a
plane
or
manufacturing
a
firearm
may
well
require
appropriate
li
censing
to
perform
legally
fortunately
no
license
is
needed
for
the
distribution
or
receipt
of
information
it
self
so
the
next
time
you
look
at
the
political
scene
and
despair
thinking
well
if

the
nation
and
of
this
state

turn

i
give
a
summary
on
my
recent
question
in
article
pqscbcnhminniezdvunimainzde
i
wrote
the
recent
discussion
in
this
news
group
suggests
that
a
key
search
attack
against
des
is
quite
feasible
now
but
normally
des
is
applied
in
cbc
or
cfb
mode
where
one
chooses
a
random
init
vector
of
bytes
questions
makes
it
sense
to
handle
the
init
vector
as
an
additional
key
then
we
have
a
bit
key
if
yes
is
anything
known
about
the
security
of
this
key
scheme
can
we
break
it
faster
than
by
exhaustive
search
through
the
bit
key
space
unfortunately
the
answer
is
no
concealing
the
initialisation
vector
essentially
doesnt
give
any
additional
security
i
got
answers
from
gradynetcomcom
marklomasclcamacuk
smbresearchattcom
that
opened
my
eyes
its
pretty
simple
say
e
is
encryption
and
d
decryption
with
key
k
on
blocks
let
be
the
initialisation
vector
the
message
blocks
the
cipher
text
blocks
then
encryption
in
cipher
block
chaining
cbc
mode
works
by
the
formula
ci
emi
xor
and
decryption
by
mi
xor
dci
so
if
the
attacker
doesnt
have
this
only
affects
the
first
message
block
but
she
can
do
her
key
search
attack
on
the
situation
in
cipher
feedback
cfb
mode
is
a
bit
more
complicated
but
similar
and
left
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
finally
there
is
the
modified
output
feedback
mode
ofb
where
des
or
whatever
block
cipher
you
use
simply
acts
as
random
generator
by
si
with
initialisation
vector
seed
and
encryption
is
given
by
ci
mi
xor

youre
reading
far
too
much
into
this
aside
from
the
obvious
fact
that
you
shouldnt
hold
anybody
to
what
they
wrote
in

old
book
in
a
rapidly
changing
field
like
this
quite
simply
she
says
that
the
security
should
not
depend
on
the
secrecy
of
the
algorithm
a
secret
algorithm
can
still
be
secure
after
all
we
just
dont
know
it
only
our
level
of
trust
is
affected
not
the
security
of
the
system
the
algorithm
could
be
rsa
for
all
we
know
which
we
believe
to
be
secure
they
have
a
much
better
reason
to
classify
the
algorithm
than
to
protect
its
security
they
want
to
protect
its
market
share
if
they
publish
the
algorithm
then
shortly
manufacturers
would
make
chips
that
implement
the
algorithm
and
standard
but
do
not
use
a
key
stored
in
escrow
and
of
course
everybody
would
buy
them
the
whole
push
of
this
chip
is
that
by
establishing
a
standard
that
you
can
only
use
if
you
follow
their
rules
they
get
us
to
follow
their
rules
without
enacting
new
laws
that
we
would
fight
tooth
and
nail
quite
simply
with
clipper
established
it
would
be
much
harder
for
another
encryption
maker
to
define
a
new
standard
to
make
phones
that
cant
talk
to
the
leading
phone
companies
the
result
is
tappable
cryptography
without
laws
forbidding
other
kinds
for
of
the
populace
to
get
untappable
crypto
you
would
have
to
build
a
special
phone
that
runs
on
top
of
this
system
and
everybody
you
talk
to
would
have
to
have
an
indentical
one
thats
the
chicken

the

is
using
its
very
special
ability
to
solve
chicken

of

to
control
this

here
what
are
the

going

and
discover
they
cant
wiretap
and
nobody

had
an

it
was
much

do
not

at
all
however
using
the

they

they

currently
it

easy

at

anybody
using

can
listen
to

the

also
obviously
the

will
make
it
much
more
difficult
for

to
eavesdrop
note
that

who
really
have
something

not

speak
of
these

if
an
illegal
operation
is
really
worth
one
can
afford
having
critical
data
carried
by
a
person
rather
than
sending
it
electronically
the
clipper
chip
will
not
change
this
the
problem
is
more
politic
foreign
countries
will
never
accept
the
clipper
chip
is
the
access
to
the
escrow
cannot
be
directly
granted
to
their
own
police
following
their
own
law
not
the
us
law
ie
each
country
will
have
its
own

how
then
will
it
be
possible
to
monitor
the
international
traffic
or
will
encrypted

traffic
be
possible
or
will
there
be
an

some

is
it

this
will
be
more
and
more
impossible
as
the
volume
of
electronic

will
increrase
in
the

think
that
the

only
be
an
interesting
device
to
limit
the
risk
of

ones
girlfriends
husband
listening

it
will
bring
no
more
as

is
it
worth
i
think
so
if
its
cost
is
limited
i
think
that
many
privacy
invasions
are
done
not
only
by
official
services
but
also
by
private
entities
the

help
reducing
these

you
are
correct
several

tempest
is
a
codeword
for
a
standard
shared
between
the
nato
governments
to
limit
the
inadvertent
emission
of
information
by
either
electromagnetic
radiation
or
conduction
the
limits
set
in
the
standard
are
classified
but
there
is
open
source
information
to
the
effect
that
either
the
electrical
or
magnetic
components
of
electromagnetism
can
be
exploited
it
is
a
basic
rule
of
physics
that
there
is
an
electromagnetic
field
associated
with
any
path
that
conducts
a
flow
of
electrons
among
other
things
i
drive
a
korean
built
at
clone
and
an
associated
pin
dotmatrix

the
major
source
of
unintentional
emission
is
the
crt
to
that
can
be
added
the
video
driver
card
the
parallel
cable
and
the

head
the
emissions
from
these
are
gross
can
be
detected
with
the
crudest

were
i
to
apply
good
test
equipment
and
some

to
measuring
emission
levels
i
would
find

other
potential

information
where
cryptography
is
used

poor
tempest
protection
becomes
an
important
security
hazard
in
the
early
eighties
the
need
to
allow
some
commercial
concerns
particularly
financial
institutions
a
level
of
protection
against
tempest
threat
led
to
a
series
of
briefings
to
invited
corporations
and
to
the
release
of
a
cutdown
tempest
stansard
for
commercial
use
i
say
release
for
while
equipment
to
meet
the
standard
is
available

i
cannot

this

it

technology
when

really
it
is
just
technology
that
allows
action
to
be
realized
more
efficently
and
on
a
larger
scale
by
its
very
nature
it
favors
the

try
not

the
development

even
young

vcr
machines
not

complex
to

it
favors
the
adaptable
who
are
quick
to
see
the
merit
of
the

over
the
sluggish
who
cling
to

tested
ways
adaptibility

flexibility
is
always
better

the
stiff

a
young

an

a

this

what

do
they
really
care

yeah
youre
missing
the

that
since
the

is
classified
if
you
reverse
engineer
it
from
the

and
later
publish
it

build

youre
divulging
classified

and
are
in
a
big

of
trouble
i
dont
think
they
can
do
that
without
changing
the
law
the
chip
itself
isnt
classified
and
reverse
engineering
is
allowed
by
law
possibly
unless
prohibited
by
a
valid
contract
the
algorithm
may
be
classified
but
there
are
many
court
cases
ruling
that
information
identical
to

obtained
from

suppose

if

he

receiving

now
the
question
is
how
can
this

not

security
can
we

can

use

can

your
opponent
could
spoof
a
validlooking
message
since
any
deciphered
plaintext
in
a
spot
that
should
be
carrying
will
show
that
something
funnys
going
on
if
for
each
message
bit
mi
we
used
up
one
random
bit
ri
to
decide
whether
to
insert
a
into
the
plaintext
stream
wed
get
a
total
pad
use
of
times
the
message
length
wed
expand
the
message
size
by
about
half
each
that
should
appear
in
the
plaintext
stream
that
doesnt
is
a
guess
for
our
wouldbe
spoofer
at
each
bit
she
has
to
guess
im
trying
to
see
how
to
quantify
her
chances
of
making
it
all
the
way
through
the
spoofed
message
but
it
gets
a
little
complicated
because
she
can
get
un
synched
and
still
happen
to
have
a
in
that
place
in
the
spoofed
message
now
i
can
see
a
simple
way
of
doing
this
thats
got
to
be
as
secure
as
a
onetime
pad
at
a
cost
of
using
times
the
message
length
in
pad
bits
for
each
message
bit
mi
use
one
random
bit
ri
and
xor
them
together
to
get
xi
now
encrypt
the
three
bits
with
the
onetime
pad
the
enemy
has
no
way
of
guessing
what
ri
is
so
heshe
cant
guess
what
xi
is
either
any
change
she
makes
in
the
ciphertext
stream
will
have
to
involve
a
guess
of
what
ri
was
is
there
any
way
to
do
this
without
using
so
many
pad
bits
spoofing
the
message
is
equivalent
to
correctly
guessing
as
many
random
bits
as
there
are
bits
in
the
message
clearly
this
makes
spoofing
messages
just
as
hard
if
you
know
the
whole
message
text
as
if
you
know
none
of
it
in
fact
it
looks
to
me
like
this
makes
it
just
as
hard
to
generate
a
spoofed
message
with
the
ciphertext
as
without
it
but
im
not
entirely
sure
about
that
is
there
an
easier
way
of
doing
this
thats
provably
as
secure
as
the
onetime
pad
john

subject
authentication
and
onetimepads
was

advanced
one
time
pad
in

olsonumbcedu
bryan
olson
cmsc
g
writes
the
onetimepad
yeilds
ideal
security
but
has
a
wellknown
flaw
in
authentication
suppose
you
use
a
random
bit
stream
as
the
pad
and
exclusiveor
as
the
encryption
operation
if
an
adversary
knows
the
plaintext
of
a
message
he
can
change
it
into
any
other
message
heres
how
it
works
alice
is
sending
bob
a
plaintext
p
under
a
key
stream
s
alice
computes
the
ciphertext
c
s
xor
p
and
sends
it
to
bob
eve
knows
the
plainext
p
but
wants
the
message
to
appear
as
p
eve
intercepts
c
and
computes
c
c
xor
p
xor
p
s
xor
p
eve
sends
c
to
bob
bob
decrypts
c
by
computing
cxor
s
p
thus
receiving
the
false
message
which
was
substituted
by
eve
firstly
an
aside
i
agree
that
the
weakness
exists
but
i
have
a
lot
of
trouble
believing
that
it
represents
a
difficulty
in
real
life
given
the
purpose
of
the
onetime
pad
is
to
give
unbreakable
security
and
the
expense
of
key
distribution
etc
imply
that
the
clients
really
do
want
that
level
of
security
these
same
people
want
to
keep
p
a
secret
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
eve
might
happen
to
have
a
copy
of
p
lying
around
i
am
aware
that
the
same
argument
applies
to
eve
knowing
even
a
small
part
of
the
message
but
eve
must
know
exactly
where
which
bytes
in
c
her
known
susequence
starts
or
the
result
will
be
garbled
i
find
this
at
least
as
surprising
back
to
the
question
if
i
had
the
resources
to
use
a
onetimepad
for
such
transmissions
i
would
also
append
a
message
authentication
code
to
the
message
using
up
the
next
bits
of
the
onetimepad
as
the
key
perhaps
your
original
question
basically
asked
whether
there
was
any
way
to
authenticate
the
message
with
the
same
degree
of
security
as
the
pad
itself
provided
and
i
dont
know
the
answer
however
i
would
propose
the
following
for
discussion
alice
and
bob
have
an
arbitrary
number
of
secret
random
bits
to
share
which
eve
doesnt
know
she
finds
them
out
effectively
by
knowing
some
p
and
the
corresponding
c
it
is
the
fact
that
they
correspond
that
causes
the
problem
if
a
message
authentication
code
was
to
be
created
using
some
onetimepad
operation
such
that
eve
could
not
know
which
parts
of
the
mac
were
affected
by
which
parts
of
the
input
she
would
be
unable
to
forge
a
mac
to
correspond
what
is
required
is
a
nonlinear
combiner
of
parts
of
the
message
nonlinear
so
that
simply
xoring
or
subtracting
or
whatever
doesnt
have
exactly
the
same
effect
now
at
the
end
of
the
encrypted
message
c
alice
appends
a
nbit
mac
computed
as
follows
means
the
next
full
chunk
of
the
one
time
pad
compute
p
xor
and
pad
to
an
nbit
boundary
with
more
of
s
break
into
nbit
chunks
set
mac
to
initialisation
vector
for
i
in
each
chunk
sequentially
set
mac
mac
nlop
at
the
end
of
this
process
mac
is
the
message
authentication
code
bob
verifies
the
mac
in
the
obvious
manner
he
recovers
the
plaintext
p
then
uses
some
more
of
his
pad
to
reproduce
the
mac
in
the
same
manner
nlop
is
the
nonlinear
operator
and
there
is
the
rub
the
simplest
nonlinear
operator
i
can
think
of
is
an
sbox
that
is
have
a
fixed
even
published
permutation
of
the
nbit
integers
an
indexable
table
called
sbox
and
use
x
nlop
y
x
xor
sboxy
practically
speaking
i
think
this
solves
your
problem
as
eve
never
sees
the
intermediate
output
and
hence
cant
deduce
or
perform
any
valid
substitution
on
it
also
practically
speaking
you
want
the
mac
to
be
fairly
large
say
bits
but
you
might
not
want
a
gigabyte
say
sbox
so
you
might
work
on
bytesized
sboxes
but
i
think
that
is
an
irrelevant
detail
for
the
discussion
at
hand
who
will
be
first
to
point
out
my
errors
or
give
me
a
pointer
to
some
literature
