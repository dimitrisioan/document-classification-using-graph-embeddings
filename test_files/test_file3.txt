i
cant
find
my
source
but
if
you
state
that
you
will
retract
your
claim
ill
go
dig
one
up
at
the
library
fair
enough
are
you
serious
im
not
talking
about
retracting
anything
until
you
have
produced
something
if
you
were
not
just
talking
off
the
top
of
your
head
i
would
assume
that
you
have
some
memory
of
what
your
source
is
put
up
now
without
conditions
yes
very
serious
i
claim
that
i
can
substantiate
my
statement
that
rudman
says
he
doesnt
believe
perot
was
investigating
him
you
claim
perot
was
investigating
him
if
you
will
state
that
you
were
in
error
on
this
point
provided
i
produce
the
source
ill
go
dig
it
up
now
give
me
one
reason
why
i
should
go
to
the
trouble
if
you
wont
agree
to
this
it
is
simple
enough
you
know
but
i
dont
have
time
to
waste
if
youll
just
blow
it
off
with
more
of
the
tripe
you
usually
