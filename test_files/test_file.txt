The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. It is independent of government but works closely with the Treasury.

It describes its key job as ensuring the UK has secure banknotes, stable prices, a safe banking sector and a resilient financial system.

Why does the Bank of England change interest rates?
The bank has a target to keep inflation - the official measure of how quickly prices are rising - at 2%.

The headline Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate - which tracks the price of a typical basket of goods - has fallen from a high of 11.1% in October 2022 to 4.6% in October 2023.

That was a sharp drop from 6.7% in September, and is the lowest rate in two years.
