ignoring
for
the
moment
the
question
of
patented
processes
such
as
public
keys
can
the
government
stop
me
from
using
an
encryption
process
following
precedent
in
other
areas
the
government
is
likely
to
put
a
tax
on
encryption
technology
once
the
tax
is
imposed
it
becomes
a
federal
matter
and
suspicision
of
an
unlicensed
cryptographic
tool
will
bring
the
batf
or
fbi
tossing
grenades
into
your
house
the
batf
appears
to
be
the
logical
agency
to
enforce
such
regulations
federal
control
over
alocohol
tobacco
and
firearms
is
similary
based
on
taxes
look
at
the
fcc
they
wont
allow
sale
of
any
receiever
that
can
receive
bands
that
are
supposed
to
be
private
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
desire
to
prevent
harmful
interference
if
the
government
can
make
a
radio
receiver
illegal
what
makes
you
think
they
wont
claim
the
right
to
control
encryption
