there
are
three
issues
with
clipper
the
first
is
whether
or
not
the
architecture
of
the
whole
scheme
is
capable
of
working
my
answer
with
one
significant
exception
is
yes
i
really
do
think
that
nsa
and
nist
have
designed
this
scheme
about
as
well
as
can
be
assuming
that
their
real
objectives
are
as
stated
to
permit
wiretapping
under
certain
carefullycontrolled
circumstances
with
a
minimum
risk
of
abuse
the
exception
is
that
u
exists
outside
of
the
chip
on
a
programming
diskette
thats
seriously
wrong
and
should
be
loaded
onto
the
chip
separately
to
those
who
disagree
and
i
dont
claim
my
answer
is
obvious
though
i
found
my
own
reasoning
sufficiently
persuasive
that
i
was
forced
to
rewrite
the
conclusions
section
of
my
technical
analysis
paper
i
had
originally
blasted
the
scheme
i
issue
this
invitation
assume
that
you
were
charged
with
implementing
such
a
system
with
complete
regard
for
civil
rights
and
due
process
what
would
you
do
differently
in
answering
this
question
please
accept
nsas
fundamental
assumptions
that
both
strong
cryptography
against
outsiders
and
the
ability
to
wiretap
some
domestic
users
is
necessary
if
you
feel
it
necessary
to
challenge
those
assumptions
do
it
in
the
context
of
the
last
issue
i
present
below
right
here
im
discussing
just
the
technical
aspects
and
no
i
dont
by
any
means
claim
that
just
because
something
can
be
done
it
should
be
ok
steve
heres
a
sketch
of
an
alternative
that
i
believe
addresses
most
of
the
objections

anything
programmed
into
the
chip
can
be
determined
by
destroying
the
chip
can
not
be
determined
except
by
destroying
the
chip
unfortunately
this
may
not
be
true
in
reality
i
suppose
its
possible
to
determine
how
a
chip
has
been
programmed
with
a
sophisticatedsp

the

leas
must
contact
all
escrow
agencies
with
the
serial
numbers
from
both
chips
and
the
encrypted
partial
keys
this
allows
the
agencies
to
record
that
both
chips
were
tapped
leas
only
get
the
session
key
not
the
key
to
all
conversations
of
a
particular
chip
this
precludes
realtime
decrypting
of
a
conversation
but
that
isnt
one
of
the
stated
requirements
observation
in
order
for
any
secure
by
tapable
communication
scheme
to
work
the
active
parts
need
to
share
a
secret
and
if
this
secret
is
revealed
communications
by
those
that
know
the
secret
can
be
made
untapable
obvious
candidates
are
the
cryptographic
algorithm
and
the
master
family
key
relative
size
and
complexity
suggests
that
the
key
can
be
obtained
from
a
silicon
implementation
of
the
scheme
a
lot
easier
and
faster
than
the
algorithm
