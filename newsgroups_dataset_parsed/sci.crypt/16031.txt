RE
CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
IN
ARTICLE
SMBRESEARCHATTCOM
STEVEN
BELLOVIN
WRITES
THERE
ARE
THREE
ISSUES
WITH
CLIPPER
THE
FIRST
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
ARCHITECTURE
OF
THE
WHOLE
SCHEME
IS
CAPABLE
OF
WORKING
MY
ANSWER
WITH
ONE
SIGNIFICANT
EXCEPTION
IS
YES
I
REALLY
DO
THINK
THAT
NSA
AND
NIST
HAVE
DESIGNED
THIS
SCHEME
ABOUT
AS
WELL
AS
CAN
BE
ASSUMING
THAT
THEIR
REAL
OBJECTIVES
ARE
AS
STATED
TO
PERMIT
WIRETAPPING
UNDER
CERTAIN
CAREFULLYCONTROLLED
CIRCUMSTANCES
WITH
A
MINIMUM
RISK
OF
ABUSE
THE
EXCEPTION
IS
THAT
U
EXISTS
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
CHIP
ON
A
PROGRAMMING
DISKETTE
THATS
SERIOUSLY
WRONG
AND
SHOULD
BE
LOADED
ONTO
THE
CHIP
SEPARATELY
TO
THOSE
WHO
DISAGREE
AND
I
DONT
CLAIM
MY
ANSWER
IS
OBVIOUS
THOUGH
I
FOUND
MY
OWN
REASONING
SUFFICIENTLY
PERSUASIVE
THAT
I
WAS
FORCED
TO
REWRITE
THE
CONCLUSIONS
SECTION
OF
MY
TECHNICAL
ANALYSIS
PAPER
I
HAD
ORIGINALLY
BLASTED
THE
SCHEME
I
ISSUE
THIS
INVITATION
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
WERE
CHARGED
WITH
IMPLEMENTING
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
WITH
COMPLETE
REGARD
FOR
CIVIL
RIGHTS
AND
DUE
PROCESS
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
DIFFERENTLY
IN
ANSWERING
THIS
QUESTION
PLEASE
ACCEPT
NSAS
FUNDAMENTAL
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT
BOTH
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AGAINST
OUTSIDERS
AND
THE
ABILITY
TO
WIRETAP
SOME
DOMESTIC
USERS
IS
NECESSARY
IF
YOU
FEEL
IT
NECESSARY
TO
CHALLENGE
THOSE
ASSUMPTIONS
DO
IT
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
LAST
ISSUE
I
PRESENT
BELOW
RIGHT
HERE
IM
DISCUSSING
JUST
THE
TECHNICAL
ASPECTS
AND
NO
I
DONT
BY
ANY
MEANS
CLAIM
THAT
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
CAN
BE
DONE
IT
SHOULD
BE
OK
