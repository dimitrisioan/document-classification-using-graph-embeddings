conference
november
you
know
technologyand
particularly
computer
technologyhas
often
gotten
a
bad
rap
in
libertarian
cir
cles
we
tend
to
think
of
orwells
or
terry
gilliams
brazil
or
the
proximity
detectors
keeping
east
berlins
slavecitizens
on
their
own
side
of
the
border
or
the
so
phisticated
bugging
devices
nixon
used
to
harass
those
on
his
enemies
list
or
we
recognize
that
for
the
price
of
a
ticket
on
the
concorde
we
can
fly
at
twice
the
speed
of
sound
but
only
if
we
first
walk
thru
a
magnetometer
run
by
a
government
policeman
and
permit
him
to
paw
thru
our
be
longings
if
it
beeps
but
i
think
that
mindset
is
a
mistake
before
there
were
cattle
prods
governments
tortured
their
prisoners
with
clubs
and
rubber
hoses
before
there
were
lasers
for
eavesdropping
governments
used
binoculars
and
lipreaders
though
government
certainly
uses
technology
to
oppress
the
evil
lies
not
in
the
tools
but
in
the
wielder
of
the
tools
in
fact
technology
represents
one
of
the
most
promis
ing
avenues
available
for
recapturing
our
freedoms
from
those
who
have
stolen
them
by
its
very
nature
it
favors
the
bright
who
can
put
it
to
use
over
the
dull
who
can
not
it
favors
the
adaptable
who
are
quick
to
see
the
merit
of
the
new
over
the
sluggish
who
cling
to
time
tested
ways
and
what
two
better
words
are
there
to
de
scribe
government
bureaucracy
than
dull
and
sluggish
one
of
the
clearest
classic
triumphs
of
technology
over
tyranny
i
see
is
the
invention
of
the
manportable
crossbow
with
it
an
untrained
peasant
could
now
reliably
and
lethally
engage
a
target
out
to
fifty
meterseven
if
that
target
were
a
mounted
chainmailed
knight
unlike
the
longbow
which
admittedly
was
more
powerful
and
could
get
off
more
shots
per
unit
time
the
crossbow
required
no
formal
training
to
utilize
whereas
the
longbow
required
elaborate
visual
tactile
and
kinesthetic
coordination
to
achieve
any
degree
of
accuracy
the
wielder
of
a
crossbow
could
simply
put
the
weapon
to
his
shoulder
sight
along
the
arrow
itself
and
be
reasonably
assured
of
hitting
his
tar
get
moreover
since
just
about
the
only
mounted
knights
likely
to
visit
your
average
peasant
would
be
government
soldiers
and
tax
collectors
the
utility
of
the
device
was
plain
with
it
the
common
rabble
could
defend
themselves
not
only
against
one
another
but
against
their
governmental
masters
it
was
the
medieval
equivalent
of
the
armor
piercing
bullet
and
consequently
kings
and
priests
the
medieval
equivalent
of
a
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
crossbows
threatened
death
and
excommunication
respec
tively
for
its
unlawful
possession
looking
at
later
developments
we
see
how
technology
like
the
firearmparticularly
the
repeating
rifle
and
the
handgun
later
followed
by
the
gatling
gun
and
more
advanced
machine
gunsradically
altered
the
balance
of
interpersonal
and
intergroup
power
not
without
reason
was
the
colt
called
the
equalizer
a
frail
dancehall
hostess
with
one
in
her
possession
was
now
fully
able
to
protect
herself
against
the
brawniest
roughneck
in
any
saloon
advertise
ments
for
the
period
also
reflect
the
merchandising
of
the
repeating
cartridge
rifle
by
declaring
that
a
man
on
horseback
armed
with
one
of
these
rifles
simply
cannot
be
captured
and
as
long
as
his
captors
were
relying
upon
flintlocks
or
singleshot
rifles
the
quote
is
doubtless
a
true
one
updating
now
to
the
present
the
publickey
cipher
with
a
personal
computer
to
run
it
represents
an
equiv
alent
quantum
leapin
a
defensive
weapon
not
only
can
such
a
technique
be
used
to
protect
sensitive
data
in
ones
own
possession
but
it
can
also
permit
two
strangers
to
ex
change
information
over
an
insecure
communications
channela
wiretapped
phone
line
for
example
or
skywriting
for
that
matterwithout
ever
having
previously
met
to
exchange
cipher
keys
with
a
thousanddollar
com
puter
you
can
create
a
cipher
that
a
multimegabuck
cray
xmp
cant
crack
in
a
year
within
a
few
years
it
should
be
economically
feasible
to
similarly
encrypt

communi
cations
soon
after
that
fullcolor
digitized

technology
will
not
only
have
made
wiretapping

it
will
have
totally
demolished

over

formation
transfer
id
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
sketch
the
mathemat
ics
which
makes
this
principle
possible
this
algorithm
is
called
the
rsa
algorithm
after
rivest
shamir
and
adleman
who
jointly
created
it
its
security
derives
from
the
fact
that
if
a
very
large
number
is
the
product
of
two
very
large
primes
then
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
the
two
prime
factors
from
analysis
of
their
product
ex
tremely
in
the
sense
that
if
primes
p
and
q
have
digits
apiece
then
their
product
cannot
in
gen
eral
be
factored
in
less
than
years
by
the
most
powerful
computer
now
in
existence
the
public
part
of
the
key
consists
of
the
prod
uct
pq
of
the
two
large
primes
p
and
q
and
one
fac
tor
call
it
x
of
the
product
xy
where
xy
the
private
part
of
the
key
consists
of
the
other
factor
y
each
block
of
the
text
to
be
encrypted
is
first
turned
into
an
integereither
by
using
ascii
or
even
a
simple
representation
this
integer
is
then
raised
to
the
power
x
modulo
pq
and
the
resulting
integer
is
then
sent
as
the
encrypted
message
the
receiver
decrypts
by
taking
this
integer
to
the
secret
power
y
modulo
pq
it
can
be
shown
that
this
process
will
always
yield
the
original
number
started
with
what
makes
this
a
groundbreaking
development
and
why
it
is
called
publickey
cryptography
is
that
i
can
openly
publish
the
product
pq
and
the
number
x
while
keeping
secret
the
number
y
so
that
anyone
can
send
me
an
encrypted
message
namely
x
a
mod
pq
but
only
i
can
recover
the
original
message
a
by
taking
what
they
send
raising
it
to
the
power
y
and
taking
the
result
mod
pq
the
risky
step
meeting
to
exchange
cipher
keys
has
been
eliminated
so
people
who
may
not
even
trust
each
other
enough
to
want
to
meet
may
still
reliably
ex
change
encrypted
messageseach
party
having
selected
and
disseminated
his
own
pq
and
his
x
while
maintaining
the
secrecy
of
his
own
y
another
benefit
of
this
scheme
is
the
notion
of
a
dig
ital
signature
to
enable
one
to
authenticate
the
source
of
a
given
message
normally
if
i
want
to
send
you
a
message
i
raise
my
plaintext
a
to
your
x
and
take
the
result
mod
your
pq
and
send
that
however
if
in
my
message
i
take
the
plaintext
a
and
raise
it
to
my
secret
power
y
take
the
result
mod
my
pq
then
raise
that
result
to
your
x
mod
your
pq
and
send
this
then
even
after
you
have
normally
decrypted
the
message
it
will
still
look
like
garbage
however
if
you
then
raise
it
to
my
public
power
x
and
take
the
result
mod
my
public
pq
so
you
will
not
only
recover
the
ori
ginal
plaintext
message
but
you
will
know
that
no
one
but
i
could
have
sent
it
to
you
since
no
one
else
knows
my
secret
y
and
these
are
the
very
concerns
by
the
way
that
are
to
day
tormenting
the
soviet
union
about
the
whole
question
of
personal
computers
on
the
one
hand
they
recognize
that
american
schoolchildren
are
right
now
growing
up
with
com
puters
as
commonplace
as
sliderules
used
to
bemore
so
in
fact
because
there
are
things
computers
can
do
which
will
interest
and
instruct
and
and
it
is
pre
cisely
these
students
who
one
generation
hence
will
be
going
headtohead
against
their
soviet
counterparts
for
the
soviets
to
hold
back
might
be
a
suicidal
as
continuing
to
teach
swordsmanship
while
your
adversaries
are
learning
ballistics
on
the
other
hand
whatever
else
a
personal
computer
may
be
it
is
also
an
exquisitely
efficient
copying
machinea
floppy
disk
will
hold
upwards
of
words
of
text
and
can
be
copied
in
a
couple
of
minutes
if
this
werent
threatening
enough
the
computer
that
performs
the
copy
can
also
encrypt
the
data
in
a
fashion
that
is
all
but
unbreakable
remember
that
in
soviet
society
publicly
ac
cessible
xerox
machines
are
unknown
the
relatively
few
copying
machines
in
existence
are
controlled
more
inten
sively
than
machine
guns
are
in
the
united
states
now
the
conservative
position
is
that
we
should
not
sell
these
computers
to
the
soviets
because
they
could
use
them
in
weapons
systems
the
liberal
position
is
that
we
should
sell
them
in
the
interests
of
mutual
trade
and
cooperationand
anyway
if
we
dont
make
the
sale
there
will
certainly
be
some
other
nation
willing
to
for
my
part
im
ready
to
suggest
that
the
libertarian
position
should
be
to
give
them
to
the
soviets
for
free
and
if
necessary
make
them
take
them
and
if
that
doesnt
work
load
up
an
blackbird
and
air
drop
them
over
moscow
in
the
middle
of
the
night
paid
for
by
private
sub
scription
of
course
not
taxation
i
confess
that
this
is
not
a
position
that
has
gained
much
support
among
members
of
the
conventional
leftright
political
spectrum
but
af
ter
all
in
the
words
of
one
of
illuminatuss
characters
we
are
political
noneuclideans
the
shortest
distance
to
a
particular
goal
may
not
look
anything
like
what
most
people
would
consider
a
straight
line
taking
a
long
enough
worldview
it
is
arguable
that
breaking
the
soviet
govern
ment
monopoly
on
information
transfer
could
better
lead
to
the
enfeeblement
and
indeed
to
the
ultimate
dissolution
of
the
soviet
empire
than
would
the
production
of
another
dozen
missiles
aimed
at
moscow
but
theres
the
rub
a
long
enough
world
view
does
suggest
that
the
evil
the
oppressive
the
coercive
and
the
simply
stupid
will
get
what
they
deserve
but
whats
not
immediately
clear
is
how
the
rest
of
us
can
escape
being
killed
enslaved
or
pauperized
in
the
process
when
the
liberals
and
other
collectivists
began
to
at
tack
freedom
they
possessed
a
reasonably
stable
healthy
functioning
economy
and
almost
unlimited
time
to
proceed
to
hamstring
and
dismantle
it
a
policy
of
political
gradualism
was
at
least
conceivable
but
now
we
have
patchwork
crazyquilt
economy
held
together
by
baling
wire
and
spit
the
state
not
only
taxes
us
to
feed
the
poor
while
also
inducing
farmers
to
slaughter
milk
cows
and
drive
up
food
pricesit
then
simultaneously
turns
around
and
sub
sidizes
research
into
agricultural
chemicals
designed
to
in
crease
yields
of
milk
from
the
cows
left
alive
or
witness
the
fact
that
a
decline
in
the
price
of
oil
is
considered
as
potentially
frightening
as
a
comparable
increase
a
few
years
ago
when
the
price
went
up
we
were
told
the
economy
risked
collapse
for
for
want
of
energy
the
price
increase
was
called
the
moral
equivalent
of
war
and
the
feds
swung
into
action
for
the
first
time
in
american
history
the
speed
at
which
you
drive
your
car
to
work
in
the
morning
be
came
an
issue
of
federal
concern
now
when
the
price
of
oil
drops
again
we
risk
problems
this
time
because
ameri
can
oil
companies
and
third
world
basketcase
nations
who
sell
oil
may
not
be
able
to
ever
pay
their
debts
to
our
grossly
overextended
banks
the
suggested
panacea
is
that
government
should
now
reraise
the
oil
prices
that
opec
has
lowered
via
a
new
oil
tax
since
the
government
is
seeking
to
raise
oil
prices
to
about
the
same
extent
as
opec
did
what
can
we
call
this
except
the
moral
equivalent
of
civil
warthe
government
against
its
own
people
and
classically
in
international
trade
can
you
imag
ine
any
entity
in
the
world
except
a
government
going
to
court
claiming
that
a
vendor
was
selling
it
goods
too
cheaply
and
demanding
not
only
that
that
naughty
vendor
be
compelled
by
the
court
to
raise
its
prices
but
also
that
it
be
punished
for
the
act
of
lowering
them
in
the
first
place
so
while
the
statists
could
afford
to
take
a
couple
of
hundred
years
to
trash
our
economy
and
our
libertieswe
certainly
cannot
count
on
having
an
equivalent
period
of
stability
in
which
to
reclaim
them
i
contend
that
there
exists
almost
a
black
hole
effect
in
the
evolution
of
nationstates
just
as
in
the
evolution
of
stars
once
free
dom
contracts
beyond
a
certain
minimum
extent
the
state
warps
the
fabric
of
the
political
continuum
about
itself
to
the
degree
that
subsequent
reemergence
of
freedom
becomes
all
but
impossible
a
good
illustration
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
area
of
socalled
welfare
payments
when
those
who
sup
at
the
public
trough
outnumber
and
thus
outvote
those
whose
taxes
must
replenish
the
trough
then
what
possible
choice
has
a
democracy
but
to
perpetuate
and
expand
the
tak
ing
from
the
few
for
the
unearned
benefit
of
the
many
go
down
to
the
nearest
welfare
office
find
just
two
people
on
the
dole
and
recognize
that
between
them
they
form
a
voting
bloc
that
can
forever
outvote
you
on
the
question
of
who
owns
your
lifeand
the
fruits
of
your
lifes
labor
so
essentially
those
who
love
liberty
need
an
edge
of
some
sort
if
were
ultimately
going
to
prevail
we
obvi
ously
cant
use
the
altruists
otherdirectedness
of
work
slave
suffer
sacrifice
so
that
next
generation
of
a
billion
random
strangers
can
live
in
a
better
world
recognize
that
however
immoral
such
an
appeal
might
be
it
is
nonetheless
an
extremely
powerful
one
in
todays
culture
if
you
can
convince
people
to
work
energetically
for
a
cause
caring
only
enough
for
their
personal
welfare
so
as
to
remain
alive
enough
and
healthy
enough
to
continue
workingthen
you
have
a
truly
massive
reservoir
of
energy
to
draw
from
equally
clearly
this
is
just
the
sort
of
ap
peal
which
tautologically
cannot
be
utilized
for
egoistic
or
libertarian
goals
if
i
were
to
stand
up
before
you
tonight
and
say
something
like
listen
follow
me
as
i
enunciate
my
noble
cause
contribute
your
money
to
support
the
cause
give
up
your
free
time
to
work
for
the
cause
strive
selflessly
to
bring
it
about
and
then
after
you
and
your
children
are
dead
maybe
your
childrens
children
will
actu
ally
live
under
egoismyoud
all
think
id
gone
mad
and
of
course
youd
be
right
because
the
point
im
trying
to
make
is
that
libertarianism
andor
egoism
will
be
spread
if
when
and
as
individual
libertarians
andor
egoists
find
it
profitable
andor
enjoyable
to
do
so
and
probably
only
then
while
i
certainly
do
not
disparage
the
concept
of
poli
tical
action
i
dont
believe
that
it
is
the
only
nor
even
necessarily
the
most
costeffective
path
toward
increasing
freedom
in
our
time
consider
that
for
a
fraction
of
the
investment
in
time
money
and
effort
i
might
expend
in
try
ing
to
convince
the
state
to
abolish
wiretapping
and
all
forms
of
censorshipi
can
teach
every
libertarian
whos
in
terested
how
to
use
cryptography
to
abolish
them
unilaterally
there
is
a
maxima
proverbgenerally
attributed
to
the
eskimoes
which
very
likely
most
libertarians
have
al
ready
heard
and
while
you
likely
would
not
quarrel
with
the
saying
you
might
well
feel
that
youve
heard
it
often
enough
already
and
that
it
has
nothing
further
to
teach
us
and
moreover
that
maybe
youre
even
tired
of
hearing
it
i
shall
therefore
repeat
it
now
if
you
give
a
man
a
fish
the
saying
runs
you
feed
him
for
a
day
but
if
you
teach
a
man
how
to
fish
you
feed
him
for
a
lifetime
your
exposure
to
the
quote
was
probably
in
some
sort
of
a
workfare
vs
welfare
context
namely
that
if
you
genuinely
wish
to
help
someone
in
need
you
should
teach
him
how
to
earn
his
sustenance
not
simply
how
to
beg
for
it
and
of
course
this
is
true
if
only
because
the
next
time
he
is
hungry
there
might
not
be
anybody
around
willing
or
even
able
to
give
him
a
fish
whereas
with
the
information
on
how
to
fish
he
is
completely
self
sufficient
but
i
submit
that
this
exhausts
only
the
first
order
content
of
the
quote
and
if
there
were
nothing
further
to
glean
from
it
i
would
have
wasted
your
time
by
citing
it
again
after
all
it
seems
to
have
almost
a
cryptoaltruist
slant
as
though
to
imply
that
we
should
structure
our
ac
tivities
so
as
to
maximize
the
benefits
to
such
hungry
beggars
as
we
may
encounter
but
consider
suppose
this
eskimo
doesnt
know
how
to
fish
but
he
does
know
how
to
hunt
walruses
you
on
the
other
hand
have
often
gone
hungry
while
traveling
thru
walrus
country
because
you
had
no
idea
how
to
catch
the
damn
things
and
they
ate
most
of
the
fish
you
could
catch
and
now
suppose
the
two
of
you
decide
to
exchange
information
bartering
fishing
knowledge
for
hunting
knowledge
well
the
first
thing
to
observe
is
that
a
transaction
of
this
type
categorically
and
unambiguously
refutes
the
marxist
premise
that
every
trade
must
have
a
winner
and
a
loser
the
idea
that
if
one
person
gains
it
must
necessarily
be
at
the
expense
of
another
person
who
loses
clearly
under
this
scenario
such
is
not
the
case
each
party
has
gained
some
thing
he
did
not
have
before
and
neither
has
been
dimin
ished
in
any
way
when
it
comes
to
exchange
of
information
rather
than
material
objects
life
is
no
longer
a
zerosum
game
this
is
an
extremely
powerful
notion
the
law
of
diminishing
returns
the
first
and
second
laws
of
thermodynamicsall
those
laws
which
constrain
our
possi
bilities
in
other
contextsno
longer
bind
us
now
thats
anarchy
or
consider
another
possibility
suppose
this
hungry
eskimo
never
learned
to
fish
because
the
ruler
of
his
nationstate
had
decreed
fishing
illegal
because
fish
contain
dangerous
tiny
bones
and
sometimes
sharp
spines
he
tells
us
the
state
has
decreed
that
their
consumptionand
even
their
possessionare
too
hazardous
to
the
peoples
health
to
be
permitted
even
by
knowledgeable
willing
adults
perhaps
it
is
because
citizens
bodies
are
thought
to
be
government
property
and
therefore
it
is
the
function
of
the
state
to
punish
those
who
improperly
care
for
govern
ment
property
or
perhaps
it
is
because
the
state
gener
ously
extends
to
competent
adults
the
benefits
it
provides
to
children
and
to
the
mentally
ill
namely
a
fulltime
allpervasive
supervisory
conservatorshipso
that
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
with
making
choices
about
behavior
thought
physically
risky
or
morally
naughty
but
in
any
case
you
stare
stupefied
while
your
eskimo
informant
re
lates
how
this
law
is
taken
so
seriously
that
a
friend
of
his
was
recently
imprisoned
for
years
for
the
crime
of
pos
session
of
nine
ounces
of
trout
with
intent
to
distribute
now
you
may
conclude
that
a
society
so
grotesquely
oppressive
as
to
enforce
a
law
of
this
type
is
simply
an
affront
to
the
dignity
of
all
human
beings
you
may
go
far
ther
and
decide
to
commit
some
portion
of
your
discretion
ary
recreational
time
specifically
to
the
task
of
thwarting
this
tyrants
goal
your
rationale
may
be
altruistic
in
the
sense
of
wanting
to
liberate
the
oppressed
or
egoistic
in
the
sense
of
proving
you
can
outsmart
the
oppressoror
very
likely
some
combination
of
these
or
per
haps
even
other
motives
but
since
you
have
zero
desire
to
become
a
martyr
to
your
cause
youre
not
about
to
mount
a
military
campaign
or
even
try
to
run
a
boatload
of
fish
through
the
blockade
however
it
is
here
that
technologyand
in
particular
in
formation
technologycan
multiply
your
efficacy
literally
a
hundredfold
i
say
literally
because
for
a
fraction
of
the
effort
and
virtually
none
of
the
risk
attendant
to
smuggling
in
a
hundred
fish
you
can
quite
readily
produce
a
hundred
xerox
copies
of
fishing
instructions
if
the
tar
geted
government
like
presentday
america
at
least
permits
open
discussion
of
topics
whose
implementation
is
re
stricted
then
that
should
suffice
but
if
the
government
attempts
to
suppress
the
flow
of
information
as
well
then
you
will
have
to
take
a
little
more
effort
and
perhaps
write
your
fishing
manual
on
a
floppy
disk
encrypted
according
to
your
mythical
eskimos
publickey
parameters
but
as
far
as
increasing
realworld
access
to
fish
you
have
made
genuine
nonzero
headwaywhich
may
continue
to
snowball
as
others
redisseminate
the
information
you
have
provided
and
you
have
not
had
to
waste
any
of
your
time
trying
to
convert
id
eological
adversaries
or
even
trying
to
win
over
the
unde
cided
recall
harry
brownes
dictum
from
freedom
in
an
unfree
world
that
the
success
of
any
endeavor
is
in
general
inversely
proportional
to
the
number
of
people
whose
persua
sion
is
necessary
to
its
fulfilment
if
you
look
at
history
you
cannot
deny
that
it
has
been
dramatically
shaped
by
men
with
names
like
washington
lincoln
nixon
marcos
duvalier
khadaffi
and
their
ilk
but
it
has
also
been
shaped
by
people
with
names
like
edison
curie
marconi
tesla
and
wozniak
and
this
latter
shaping
has
been
at
least
as
per
vasive
and
not
nearly
so
bloody
and
thats
where
im
trying
to
take
the
libertech
project
rather
than
beseeching
the
state
to
please
not
en
slave
plunder
or
constrain
us
i
propose
a
libertarian
net
work
spreading
the
technologies
by
which
we
may
seize
freedom
for
ourselves
but
here
we
must
be
a
bit
careful
while
it
is
not
at
present
illegal
to
encrypt
information
when
government
wants
to
spy
on
you
there
is
no
guarantee
of
what
the
fu
ture
may
hold
there
have
been
bills
introduced
for
exam
ple
which
would
have
made
it
a
crime
to
wear
body
armor
when
government
wants
to
shoot
you
that
is
if
you
were
to
commit
certain
crimes
while
wearing
a
kevlar
vest
then
that
fact
would
constitute
a
separate
federal
crime
of
its
own
this
law
to
my
knowledge
has
not
passed
yet
but
it
does
indicate
how
government
thinks
other
technological
applications
however
do
indeed
pose
legal
risks
we
recognize
for
example
that
anyone
who
helped
a
precivil
war
slave
escape
on
the
underground
railroad
was
making
a
clearly
illegal
use
of
technologyas
the
sovereign
government
of
the
united
states
of
america
at
that
time
found
the
buying
and
selling
of
human
beings
quite
as
acceptable
as
the
buying
and
selling
of
cattle
simi
larly
during
prohibition
anyone
who
used
his
bathtub
to
ferment
yeast
and
sugar
into
the
illegal
psychoactive
drug
alcoholthe
controlled
substance
winewas
using
technol
ogy
in
a
way
that
could
get
him
shot
dead
by
federal
agents
for
his
crimeunfortunately
not
to
be
restored
to
life
when
congress
reversed
itself
and
repermitted
use
of
this
drug
so
to
quote
a
former
president
unindicted
co
conspirator
and
pardoned
felon
let
me
make
one
thing
perfectly
clear
the
libertech
project
does
not
advocate
participate
in
or
conspire
in
the
violation
of
any
lawno
matter
how
oppressive
unconstitutional
or
simply
stupid
such
law
may
be
it
does
engage
in
description
for
educa
tional
and
informational
purposes
only
of
technological
processes
and
some
of
these
processes
like
flying
a
plane
or
manufacturing
a
firearm
may
well
require
appropriate
li
censing
to
perform
legally
fortunately
no
license
is
needed
for
the
distribution
or
receipt
of
information
it
self
so
the
next
time
you
look
at
the
political
scene
and
despair
thinking
well
if
of
the
nation
and
of
this
state
and
of
this
city
have
to
turn
libertarian
before
ill
be
free
then
somebody
might
as
well
cut
my
goddamn
throat
now
and
put
me
out
of
my
miseryrecognize
that
such
is
not
the
case
there
exist
ways
to
make
your
self
free
if
you
wish
to
explore
such
techniques
via

you
are

any

whom
you
think
would

are
welcome
as
well
im
not
even
asking

since
my

la

actual

are
down

compared

in

out
if
you
should
have
an
idea
to

even
a

ill
be
glad
to
have
you
write
it
up

even
if
you
want
to
be
the

just

still
welcome
everything

feel

for

cause
if

for

while

trying

youre
certainly
entitled

anyway
every
application
of

principles
should
make
the

just
a

freer
and
im
certainly
willing

underwrite
that
at

for

i

you
with

final
thought
if

before

then
you
sure
