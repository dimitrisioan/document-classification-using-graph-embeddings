OF

WILL
BE
GOING

AGAINST
THEIR

COUNTERPARTS
FOR
THE

MIGHT
BE

SUICIDAL

WHATEVER

AN
EXQUISITELY

CAN

IF
THIS
WERENT
THREATENING

THE
COMPUTER
THAT
PERFORMS
THE
COPY
CAN
ALSO
ENCRYPT
THE

IN
A

THAT
IS
ALL
BUT
UNBREAKABLE
REMEMBER
THAT
IN

SOCIETY
PUBLICLY
AC
CESSIBLE
XEROX
MACHINES
ARE
UNKNOWN
THE
RELATIVELY
FEW
COPYING
MACHINES
IN
EXISTENCE
ARE
CONTROLLED
MORE
INTEN
SIVELY
THAN
MACHINE
GUNS
ARE
IN
THE
UNITED

NOW
THE
CONSERVATIVE
POSITION
IS
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
SELL
THESE
COMPUTERS
TO
THE
SOVIETS
BECAUSE
THEY
COULD
USE
THEM
IN
WEAPONS
SYSTEMS
THE
LIBERAL
POSITION
IS
THAT
WE
SHOULD
SELL
THEM
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
MUTUAL
TRADE
AND
COOPERATIONAND
ANYWAY
IF
WE
DONT
MAKE
THE
SALE
THERE
WILL
CERTAINLY
BE
SOME
OTHER
NATION
WILLING
TO
FOR
MY
PART
IM
READY
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
LIBERTARIAN
POSITION
SHOULD
BE
TO
GIVE
THEM
TO
THE
SOVIETS
FOR
FREE
AND
IF
NECESSARY
MAKE
THEM
TAKE
THEM
AND
IF
THAT
DOESNT
WORK
LOAD
UP
AN
BLACKBIRD
AND
AIR
DROP
THEM
OVER
MOSCOW
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
NIGHT
PAID
FOR
BY
PRIVATE
SUB
SCRIPTION
OF
COURSE
NOT
TAXATION
I
CONFESS
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
A
POSITION
THAT
HAS
GAINED
MUCH
SUPPORT
AMONG
MEMBERS
OF
THE
CONVENTIONAL
LEFTRIGHT
POLITICAL
SPECTRUM
BUT
AF
TER
ALL
IN
THE
WORDS
OF
ONE
OF
ILLUMINATUSS
CHARACTERS
WE
ARE
POLITICAL
NONEUCLIDEANS
THE
SHORTEST
DISTANCE
TO
A
PARTICULAR
GOAL
MAY
NOT
LOOK
ANYTHING
LIKE
WHAT
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
CONSIDER
A
STRAIGHT
LINE
TAKING
A
LONG
ENOUGH
WORLDVIEW
IT
IS
ARGUABLE
THAT
BREAKING
THE
SOVIET
GOVERN
MENT
MONOPOLY
ON
INFORMATION
TRANSFER
COULD
BETTER
LEAD
TO
THE
ENFEEBLEMENT
AND
INDEED
TO
THE
ULTIMATE
DISSOLUTION
OF
THE
SOVIET
EMPIRE
THAN
WOULD
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
ANOTHER
DOZEN
MISSILES
AIMED
AT
MOSCOW
BUT
THERES
THE
RUB
A
LONG
ENOUGH
WORLD
VIEW
DOES
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
EVIL
THE
OPPRESSIVE
THE
COERCIVE
AND
THE
SIMPLY
STUPID
WILL
GET
WHAT
THEY
DESERVE
BUT
WHATS
NOT
IMMEDIATELY
CLEAR
IS
HOW
THE
REST
OF
US
CAN
ESCAPE
BEING
KILLED
ENSLAVED
OR
PAUPERIZED
IN
THE
PROCESS
WHEN
THE
LIBERALS
AND
OTHER
COLLECTIVISTS
BEGAN
TO
AT
TACK
FREEDOM
THEY
POSSESSED
A
REASONABLY
STABLE
HEALTHY
FUNCTIONING
ECONOMY
AND
ALMOST
UNLIMITED
TIME
TO
PROCEED
TO
HAMSTRING
AND
DISMANTLE
IT
A
POLICY
OF
POLITICAL
GRADUALISM
WAS
AT
LEAST
CONCEIVABLE
BUT
NOW
WE
HAVE
PATCHWORK
CRAZYQUILT
ECONOMY
HELD
TOGETHER
BY
BALING
WIRE
AND
SPIT
THE

NOT
ONLY
TAXES
US
TO

THE

WHILE
ALSO
INDUCING

THEN
SIMULTANEOUSLY

AND
SUB
SIDIZES

DESIGNED
TO
IN
CREASE

OF

FROM
THE

LEFT
ALIVE
OR
WITNESS
THE
FACT
THAT
A
DECLINE
IN
THE
PRICE
OF

IS
CONSIDERED
AS
POTENTIALLY
FRIGHTENING
AS
A
COMPARABLE
INCREASE
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
THE

WENT
UP
WE
WERE
TOLD
THE
ECONOMY
RISKED
COLLAPSE
FOR
FOR

OF

THE

WAS
CALLED
THE
MORAL
EQUIVALENT
OF

AND
THE
FEDS
SWUNG
INTO

FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
AMERICAN
HISTORY
THE
SPEED
AT
WHICH
YOU
DRIVE
YOUR

TO

IN
THE
MORNING
BE
CAME
AN
ISSUE
OF
FEDERAL
CONCERN
NOW
WHEN
THE
PRICE
OF

DROPS
AGAIN
WE
RISK
PROBLEMS
THIS
TIME
BECAUSE
AMERI
CAN
OIL
COMPANIES
AND
THIRD

BASKETCASE
NATIONS
WHO
SELL
OIL
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
EVER
PAY
THEIR
DEBTS
TO
OUR
GROSSLY
OVEREXTENDED
BANKS
THE
SUGGESTED
PANACEA
IS
THAT
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
NOW
RERAISE
THE
OIL
PRICES
THAT
OPEC
HAS
LOWERED
VIA
A
NEW
OIL
TAX
SINCE
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
SEEKING
TO
RAISE
OIL
PRICES
TO
ABOUT
THE
SAME
EXTENT
AS
OPEC
DID
WHAT
CAN
WE
CALL
THIS
EXCEPT
THE
MORAL
EQUIVALENT
OF
CIVIL
WARTHE
GOVERNMENT
AGAINST
ITS
OWN
PEOPLE
AND
CLASSICALLY
IN
INTERNATIONAL
TRADE
CAN
YOU
IMAG
INE
ANY
ENTITY
IN
THE
WORLD
EXCEPT
A
GOVERNMENT
GOING
TO
COURT
CLAIMING
THAT
A
VENDOR
WAS
SELLING
IT
GOODS
TOO
CHEAPLY
AND
DEMANDING
NOT
ONLY
THAT
THAT
NAUGHTY
VENDOR
BE
COMPELLED
BY
THE
COURT
TO
RAISE
ITS
PRICES
BUT
ALSO
THAT
IT
BE
PUNISHED
FOR
THE
ACT
OF
LOWERING
THEM
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
SO
WHILE
THE
STATISTS
COULD
AFFORD
TO
TAKE
A
COUPLE
OF
HUNDRED
YEARS
TO
TRASH
OUR
ECONOMY
AND
OUR
LIBERTIESWE
CERTAINLY
CANNOT
COUNT
ON
HAVING
AN
EQUIVALENT
PERIOD
OF
STABILITY
IN
WHICH
TO
RECLAIM
THEM
I
CONTEND
THAT
THERE
EXISTS
ALMOST
A
BLACK

IN
THE
EVOLUTION
OF

JUST
AS
IN
THE

OF

THE

THE

ABOUT

TO
THE
DEGREE
THAT
SUBSEQUENT
REEMERGENCE
OF

BECOMES
ALL
BUT
IMPOSSIBLE
A
GOOD
ILLUSTRATION
OF
THIS
CAN
BE
SEEN
IN

OFFICE
FIND
JUST
TWO
PEOPLE
ON
THE

AND
RECOGNIZE
THAT

THEM
THEY
FORM
A

THAT
CAN
FOREVER
OUTVOTE
YOU
ON
THE
QUESTION
OF

ESSENTIALLY

SO
THAT

THIS

THE

WHEN
AND
AS
INDIVIDUAL
LIBERTARIANS
ANDOR
EGOISTS
FIND
IT
PROFITABLE
ANDOR
ENJOYABLE
TO
DO
SO
AND
PROBABLY
ONLY
THEN
WHILE
I
CERTAINLY
DO
NOT
DISPARAGE
THE
CONCEPT
OF
POLI
TICAL
ACTION
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
THE
ONLY
NOR
EVEN
NECESSARILY
THE
MOST
COSTEFFECTIVE
PATH
TOWARD
INCREASING
FREEDOM
IN
OUR
TIME
CONSIDER
THAT
FOR
A
FRACTION
OF
THE
INVESTMENT
IN
TIME
MONEY
AND
EFFORT
I
MIGHT
EXPEND
IN
TRY
ING
TO
CONVINCE
THE
STATE
TO
ABOLISH
WIRETAPPING
AND
ALL
FORMS
OF
CENSORSHIPI
CAN
TEACH
EVERY
LIBERTARIAN
WHOS
IN
TERESTED
HOW
TO
USE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
TO
ABOLISH
THEM
UNILATERALLY
THERE
IS
A
MAXIMA
PROVERBGENERALLY
ATTRIBUTED
TO
THE
ESKIMOES
WHICH
VERY
LIKELY
MOST
LIBERTARIANS
HAVE
AL
READY
HEARD
AND
WHILE
YOU
LIKELY
WOULD
NOT
QUARREL
WITH
THE
SAYING
YOU
MIGHT
WELL
FEEL
THAT
YOUVE
HEARD
IT
OFTEN
ENOUGH
ALREADY
AND
THAT
IT
HAS
NOTHING
FURTHER
TO
TEACH
US
AND
MOREOVER
THAT
MAYBE
YOURE
EVEN
TIRED
OF
HEARING
IT
I
SHALL
THEREFORE
REPEAT
IT
NOW
IF
YOU
GIVE
A
MAN
A
FISH
THE
SAYING
RUNS
YOU
FEED
HIM
FOR
A
DAY
BUT
IF
YOU
TEACH
A
MAN
HOW
TO
FISH
YOU
FEED
HIM
FOR
A
LIFETIME
YOUR
EXPOSURE
TO
THE
QUOTE
WAS
PROBABLY
IN
SOME
SORT
OF
A
WORKFARE
VS
WELFARE
CONTEXT
NAMELY
THAT
IF
YOU
GENUINELY
WISH
TO
HELP
SOMEONE
IN
NEED
YOU
SHOULD
TEACH
HIM
HOW
TO
EARN
HIS
SUSTENANCE
NOT
SIMPLY
HOW
TO
BEG
FOR
IT
AND
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
TRUE
IF
ONLY
BECAUSE
THE
NEXT
TIME
HE
IS
HUNGRY
THERE
MIGHT
NOT
BE
ANYBODY
AROUND
WILLING
OR
EVEN
ABLE
TO
GIVE
HIM
A
FISH
WHEREAS
WITH
THE
INFORMATION
ON
HOW
TO
FISH
HE
IS
COMPLETELY
SELF
SUFFICIENT
BUT
I
SUBMIT
THAT
THIS
EXHAUSTS
ONLY
THE
FIRST
ORDER
CONTENT
OF
THE
QUOTE
AND
IF
THERE
WERE
NOTHING
FURTHER
TO
GLEAN
FROM
IT
I
WOULD
HAVE
WASTED
YOUR
TIME
BY
CITING
IT
AGAIN
AFTER
ALL
IT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
ALMOST
A
CRYPTOALTRUIST
SLANT
AS
THOUGH
TO
IMPLY
THAT
WE
SHOULD
STRUCTURE
OUR
AC
TIVITIES
SO
AS
TO
MAXIMIZE
THE
BENEFITS
TO
SUCH
HUNGRY
BEGGARS
AS
WE
MAY
ENCOUNTER
BUT
CONSIDER
SUPPOSE
THIS
ESKIMO
DOESNT
KNOW
HOW
TO
FISH
BUT
HE
DOES
KNOW
HOW
TO
HUNT
WALRUSES
YOU
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HAVE
OFTEN
GONE
HUNGRY
WHILE
TRAVELING
THRU
WALRUS
COUNTRY
BECAUSE
YOU
HAD
NO
IDEA
HOW
TO
CATCH
THE
DAMN
THINGS
AND
THEY
ATE
MOST
OF
THE
FISH
YOU
COULD
CATCH
AND
NOW
SUPPOSE
THE
TWO
OF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
EXCHANGE
INFORMATION
BARTERING
FISHING
KNOWLEDGE
FOR
HUNTING
KNOWLEDGE
WELL
THE
FIRST
THING
TO
OBSERVE
IS
THAT
A
TRANSACTION
OF
THIS
TYPE
CATEGORICALLY
AND
UNAMBIGUOUSLY
REFUTES
THE
MARXIST
PREMISE
THAT
EVERY
TRADE
MUST
HAVE
A
WINNER
AND
A
LOSER
THE
IDEA
THAT
IF
ONE
PERSON
GAINS
IT
MUST
NECESSARILY
BE
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
ANOTHER
PERSON
WHO
LOSES
CLEARLY
UNDER
THIS
SCENARIO
SUCH
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
EACH
PARTY
HAS
GAINED
SOME
THING
HE
DID
NOT
HAVE
BEFORE
AND
NEITHER
HAS
BEEN
DIMIN
ISHED
IN
ANY
WAY
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
EXCHANGE
OF
INFORMATION
RATHER
THAN
MATERIAL
OBJECTS
LIFE
IS
NO
LONGER
A
ZEROSUM
GAME
THIS
IS
AN
EXTREMELY
POWERFUL
NOTION
THE
LAW
OF
DIMINISHING
RETURNS
THE
FIRST
AND
SECOND
LAWS
OF
THERMODYNAMICSALL
THOSE
LAWS
WHICH
CONSTRAIN
OUR
POSSI
BILITIES
IN
OTHER
CONTEXTSNO
LONGER
BIND
US
NOW
THATS
ANARCHY
OR
CONSIDER
ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY
SUPPOSE
THIS
HUNGRY
ESKIMO
NEVER
LEARNED
TO
FISH
BECAUSE
THE
RULER
OF
HIS
NATIONSTATE
HAD
DECREED
FISHING
ILLEGAL
BECAUSE
FISH
CONTAIN
DANGEROUS
TINY
BONES
AND
SOMETIMES
SHARP
SPINES
HE
TELLS
US
THE
STATE
HAS
DECREED
THAT
THEIR
CONSUMPTIONAND
EVEN
THEIR
POSSESSIONARE
TOO
HAZARDOUS
TO
THE
PEOPLES
HEALTH
TO
BE
PERMITTED
EVEN
BY
KNOWLEDGEABLE
WILLING
ADULTS
PERHAPS
IT
IS
BECAUSE
CITIZENS
BODIES
ARE
THOUGHT
TO
BE
GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY
AND
THEREFORE
IT
IS
THE
FUNCTION
OF
THE
STATE
TO
PUNISH
THOSE
WHO
IMPROPERLY
CARE
FOR
GOVERN
MENT
PROPERTY
OR
PERHAPS
IT
IS
BECAUSE
THE
STATE
GENER
OUSLY
EXTENDS
TO
COMPETENT
ADULTS
THE
BENEFITS
IT
PROVIDES
TO
CHILDREN
AND
TO
THE
MENTALLY
ILL
NAMELY
A

THAT
THEY

NOT
TROUBLE
THEMSELVES
WITH
MAKING
CHOICES
ABOUT
BEHAVIOR
THOUGHT
PHYSICALLY
RISKY
OR
MORALLY
NAUGHTY
BUT
IN
ANY
CASE
YOU
STARE
STUPEFIED
WHILE
YOUR
ESKIMO
INFORMANT
RE
LATES
HOW
THIS
LAW
IS
TAKEN
SO
SERIOUSLY
THAT
A
FRIEND
OF
HIS
WAS
RECENTLY
IMPRISONED
FOR
YEARS
FOR
THE
CRIME
OF
POS
SESSION
OF
NINE
OUNCES
OF

WITH
INTENT
TO

NOW
YOU
MAY
CONCLUDE
THAT
A
SOCIETY
SO
GROTESQUELY
OPPRESSIVE
AS
TO
ENFORCE
A
LAW
OF
THIS
TYPE
IS
SIMPLY
AN
AFFRONT
TO
THE
DIGNITY
OF
ALL
HUMAN
BEINGS
YOU
MAY
GO
FAR
THER
AND
DECIDE
TO
COMMIT
SOME
PORTION
OF
YOUR

ARY

SPECIFICALLY
TO
THE

OF

GOAL
YOUR

ALTRUISTIC
IN

THE

IN

YOU
CAN
OUTSMART
THE
OPPRESSOROR
VERY
LIKELY
SOME
COMBINATION
OF
THESE
OR
PER
HAPS
EVEN
OTHER
MOTIVES
BUT
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
ZERO
DESIRE
TO
BECOME
A
MARTYR
TO
YOUR
CAUSE
YOURE
NOT
ABOUT
TO
MOUNT
A
MILITARY
CAMPAIGN
OR
EVEN
TRY
TO

A

THROUGH
THE

HOWEVER
IT
IS
HERE
THAT
TECHNOLOGYAND
IN

IN

TECHNOLOGYCAN
MULTIPLY
YOUR
EFFICACY
LITERALLY
A
HUNDREDFOLD
I
SAY
LITERALLY
BECAUSE
FOR
A
FRACTION
OF
THE
EFFORT
AND
VIRTUALLY
NONE
OF
THE
RISK
ATTENDANT
TO
SMUGGLING
IN
A

YOU
CAN
QUITE

PRODUCE
A

IF
THE

GETED
GOVERNMENT
LIKE
PRESENTDAY
AMERICA
AT

PERMITS
OPEN
DISCUSSION
OF

WHOSE

IS
RE
STRICTED
THEN
THAT
SHOULD
SUFFICE
BUT
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
ATTEMPTS
TO
SUPPRESS
THE
FLOW
OF
INFORMATION
AS
WELL
THEN
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
TAKE
A
LITTLE
MORE

AND
PERHAPS
WRITE
YOUR

ON
A

INVERSELY
PROPORTIONAL
TO

OF

WHOSE
PERSUA

IS
NECESSARY
TO
ITS
FULFILMENT
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
HISTORY
YOU
CANNOT
DENY
THAT
IT
HAS
BEEN
DRAMATICALLY
SHAPED
BY
MEN
WITH
NAMES
LIKE
WASHINGTON
LINCOLN
NIXON
MARCOS
DUVALIER
KHADAFFI
AND
THEIR

BUT
IT
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
SHAPED
BY
PEOPLE
WITH
NAMES
LIKE
EDISON
CURIE
MARCONI
TESLA
AND
WOZNIAK
AND
THIS
LATTER
SHAPING
HAS
BEEN
AT

AS
PER
VASIVE
AND
NOT
NEARLY
SO
BLOODY
AND
THATS
WHERE
IM
TRYING
TO
TAKE
THE
LIBERTECH

RATHER
THAN
BESEECHING
THE

TO
PLEASE
NOT

OR

US
I
PROPOSE
A
LIBERTARIAN
NET
WORK
SPREADING
THE
TECHNOLOGIES
BY
WHICH
WE
MAY
SEIZE
FREEDOM
FOR
OURSELVES
BUT
HERE
WE
MUST
BE
A
BIT
CAREFUL
WHILE
IT
IS
NOT
AT
PRESENT
ILLEGAL
TO
ENCRYPT
INFORMATION
WHEN
GOVERNMENT
WANTS
TO
SPY
ON
YOU
THERE
IS
NO
GUARANTEE
OF
WHAT
THE
FU
TURE
MAY
HOLD
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
BILLS
INTRODUCED
FOR

PLE
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
A
CRIME
TO
WEAR

ARMOR
WHEN
GOVERNMENT
WANTS
TO
SHOOT
YOU
THAT
IS
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
COMMIT
CERTAIN
CRIMES
WHILE
WEARING
A
KEVLAR
VEST
THEN
THAT
FACT
WOULD
CONSTITUTE
A
SEPARATE
FEDERAL
CRIME
OF
ITS

THIS
LAW
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
HAS
NOT
PASSED
YET
BUT
IT
DOES
INDICATE
HOW
GOVERNMENT
THINKS
OTHER
TECHNOLOGICAL
APPLICATIONS
HOWEVER
DO
INDEED
POSE
LEGAL
RISKS
WE
RECOGNIZE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
HELPED
A
PRECIVIL
WAR
SLAVE
ESCAPE
ON
THE
UNDERGROUND
RAILROAD
WAS
MAKING
A
CLEARLY
ILLEGAL
USE
OF

THE

GOVERNMENT
OF
THE
UNITED

OF

AT
THAT
TIME
FOUND
THE
BUYING
AND

OF

QUITE
AS
ACCEPTABLE
AS
THE

LET

ONE

PERFECTLY
CLEAR
THE

IN
THE

OF
ANY
LAWNO
MATTER
HOW

SUCH
LAW
MAY
BE
IT
DOES
ENGAGE
IN
DESCRIPTION
FOR
EDUCA

INFORMATIONAL
PURPOSES
ONLY
OF
TECHNOLOGICAL
PROCESSES
AND
SOME
OF
THESE
PROCESSES
LIKE
FLYING

A

MAY

TO

LEGALLY
FORTUNATELY
NO
