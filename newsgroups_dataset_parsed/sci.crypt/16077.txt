hi

like
to
thank
you
all
for
the

special

my
question
was
how
sensible
is
des
encrypted
data
towards
bit
errors
how
much
data
per
bit
will
be
lost
in
average
i
assume
you
still
have
the
correct
key
how
much
of
the
desencrypted
data
is
affected
depends
on
the
used
encryption
mode
according
to
marcus
j
ranum
mjrtiscom
there
is
cfb
cipher
feedback
mode
ecb
electronic
code
book
mode
cbc
cipher
block
chaining
mode
ofb
output
feedback
mode
each
mode
does
some
stuff
better
than
others
ofb
and
cfb
are
designed
for
communications
streams
more
than
for
files
unfortunally
people
strongly
disagree
which
mode
will
lead
to
destruction
of
all
of
the
following
data
sure
seems
that
some
modes
will
resync
quite
fast
others
will
never
others
will
even
only
effect
the
very
block
summarized
people
said
concerning
this
matter
in
cbc
mode
only
the
current
block
will
be
affected

todd

arnold
if
you
use
cbc
cihper
block
chaining
then
the
remainder
of
the
data
will
be
destroyed
as
well
pauschsaafse
paul
schlyter
in
cfb
mode
des
synchronizes
quite
fast
probably
within
block
according
to
maracus
j
ranum
mjrtiscom
maybe
someone
definitely
knows
what
happens
in
which
mode
nevertheless
thank
you
all
very
much
again

i
assume
you

it
depends
on
the
mode
youre
using
for
a
single
input
block
a
onebit
error
will
have
a
percent
chance
of
corrupting
each
of
the
output
bits
in
other
words
it
essentially
turns
the
output
block
into
a
random
number
if
youre
encrypting
data
in
cbc
mode
however
only
the
one
block
will
be
affected
the
next
block
and
all
that
follow
it
will
be
decrypted
properly
its
a
good
idea
to
have
some
kind
of
error
correction
in
your
system
if
corrupted
bits
are
likely

i

bytes

if

the

as
well
des
is
very
seisitive
for
single

this
is
as
it

how

i
assume
you
still

the

key
it
depends
on
the
mode
youre
using
des
in
electronic
code
book
ecb
takes
a
block
of
input
bits
and
produces
output
bits
so
if
any
bits
are
changed
the
entire
block
of
bits
becomes
bad
i
forget
which
feedback
mode
is
which
in
all
of
them
the
results
of
encrypting
one
block
affect
later
blocks
with
some
modes
the
system
selfsynchronizes
so
errors
are
repaired
in
a
few
blocks
with
other
modes
once
one
block
is
bad
all
later
blocks
will
be
bad
too
theres
also
the
framing
problem
if
you
have
a
bit
change
the
block
that
its
in
changes
and
maybe
later
blocks
also
change
but
if
you
have
bits
lost
or
bits
added
bits
in
or
bits
out
everything
is
confused
after
that
from
marcus
j
ranum
mjrtiscom
depends
on
the
mode
youre
using
cfb
for
example
synchronises
pretty
fast
figure
a
bit
error
will
destroy
the
current
block
and
the
next
one
mjr
experience
is
what
you
get
if
you
dont
get
what
you
want
