MY
QUESTION
WAS
HOW
SENSIBLE
IS
DES
ENCRYPTED
DATA
TOWARDS
BIT
ERRORS
HOW
MUCH
DATA
PER
BIT
WILL
BE
LOST
IN
AVERAGE
I
ASSUME
YOU
STILL
HAVE
THE
CORRECT
KEY
HOW
MUCH
OF
THE
DESENCRYPTED
DATA
IS
AFFECTED
DEPENDS
ON
THE
USED
ENCRYPTION
MODE
ACCORDING
TO
MARCUS
J
RANUM

THERE
IS
CFB

EACH

SOME
STUFF
BETTER
THAN
OTHERS
OFB
AND
CFB
ARE
DESIGNED
FOR
COMMUNICATIONS
STREAMS
MORE
THAN
FOR
FILES
UNFORTUNALLY
PEOPLE
STRONGLY
DISAGREE
WHICH
MODE
WILL
LEAD
TO
DESTRUCTION
OF
ALL
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
DATA
SURE
SEEMS
THAT
SOME
MODES
WILL
RESYNC
QUITE
FAST
OTHERS
WILL
NEVER
OTHERS
WILL
EVEN
ONLY
EFFECT
THE
VERY

SUMMARIZED

SAID
CONCERNING
THIS
MATTER
IN

THE

HOW

I

YOU

THE

IT
DEPENDS
ON
THE

YOURE
USING

A
SINGLE
INPUT
BLOCK
A
ONEBIT
ERROR
WILL
HAVE
A
PERCENT
CHANCE
OF
CORRUPTING
EACH
OF
THE
OUTPUT
BITS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IT
ESSENTIALLY
TURNS
THE
OUTPUT
BLOCK
INTO
A
RANDOM
NUMBER
IF
YOURE
ENCRYPTING
DATA
IN
CBC
MODE
HOWEVER
ONLY
THE
ONE
BLOCK
WILL
BE
AFFECTED
THE
NEXT
BLOCK
AND
ALL
THAT
FOLLOW
IT
WILL
BE
DECRYPTED
PROPERLY
ITS
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
HAVE
SOME
KIND
OF
ERROR
CORRECTION
IN
YOUR
SYSTEM
IF
CORRUPTED

THE

OF
