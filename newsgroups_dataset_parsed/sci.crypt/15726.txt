WRITES
AS
PROMISED
I
SPOKE
TODAY
WITH
THE
COMPANY
MENTIONED
IN
A
WASHINGTON
TIMES
ARTICLE
ABOUT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
ANNOUNCEMENT
THE

THE
COMPANY
IS
SECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY
INFORMATION
WILL
BE
GIVEN
AT
THE
END
OF
THIS
MESSAGE
ON
HOW
TO
CONTACT
THEM
HIS
BELIEF
IS
THAT
ATT
WAS
MADE
KNOWN
OF
THE
CLIPPER
WELL
BEFORE
THE
REST
OF
THE
INDUSTRY
THIS
IS
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
SEVERAL
OF
WHICH
ARE
THIS
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
POINT
ATT
OBVIOUSLY
KNEW
AND
PARTICIPATED
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
THIS
AMOUNTS
TO
UNFAIR
BUSINESS
PRACTICE
AND
GIVES
ATT
AN
EARLY
MONOPOLY
ON
THE
MARKET
HOPEFULLY
A
NONEXISTANT
MARKET
OTHER
COMPANIES
THAT
COMPETE
WITH
ATT
IN
THE
CELLULAR
MARKET
MOTOROLA
NEC
ETC
HAVE
GROUNDS
TO
FILE
A
COMPLAINT
OVER
THIS
RIGHT
NOW
THE
COMPANY
IS
AFRAID
THAT
THE
NEW
CLIPPER
CHIP
WILL
PUT
THEM
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
THIS
IS
A
VERY
REAL
POSSIBILITY
SO
THEY
REALLY
NEED
HELP
IN
STOPPING
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
FROM
BECOMING
A
STANDARD
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
CONTACT
THEM
THEY
CAN
BE
REACHED
AT

IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
THE
ONE
FACT
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
OVERLOOKED
IN
THIS
WHOLE
FIASCO
IS
THE
ECONOMIC
STANDPOINT
AS
OTHERS
HAVE
MENTIONED
THE
MOST
DIFFICULTY
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
FACES
IS
AN
ECONOMIC
ONE
LETS
FACE
IT
THE
AVERAGE
CONSUMER
DOESNT
CARE
OR
KNOW
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
IS
A
BAD
IDEA
IF
THERE
IS
A
PERCEIVED
NEED
FOR
CELLULAR
ENCRYPTION
THEN
THE
COMPANIES
WILL
PROVIDE
ONE
MOST
LIKELY
A
STANDARD
WILL
EMERGE
BUT
IF
THE
CLIPPER
IS
TOO
EXPENSIVE
AND
A
CHIP
IS
WAY
TOO
MUCH
THEN
THEY
WILL
DEVELOPE
THEIR
OWN
OR
BUY
A
CHEAPER
ONE
I
GIVE
SCT
MY
FULL
SUPPORT
AND
HOPE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
GOES
THE
WAY
OF
THE
BETA
VIDEO

FORMAT
ALSO
HOPE
THEY
GET
SUED

REUSING
