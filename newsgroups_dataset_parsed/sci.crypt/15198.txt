I
HOPE
MY
CYNICISM
IS
MISPLACED
HERE
GO
AHEADIM
NOT
AFRAID
TO
BE
WRONG
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
BUT
I
HAVE
AN
UNEASY
FEELING
THAT
I
AM
RIGHT
IT
IS
AND
YOU
ARE
WRONG
YET
YOU
EMOTIONALLY
STATE
A
BUNCH
OF
CRAP
AS
FACT
WITH
A
TINY
DISCLAIMER
AT
THE
END
CHECK
YOUR
FACTS
FIRST
AND
GROW
UP

IS
THERE
SUCH
A
STRONG
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
INTEREST
IN
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AND
IMMATURITY

THEY
ARE

DONT
OFFER
ANY
