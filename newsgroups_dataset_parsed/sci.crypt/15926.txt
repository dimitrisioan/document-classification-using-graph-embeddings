re
off

cheap

russell

wrote
at
the
company
i
worked
for
previously
i
received
a
file
that
was
des
encryped
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
weeks
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
only
took
days
to
crack
the
file
no
i
dont
have
any
faith
in
des
then
it
was
either
really
good
luck
or
you
had
some
very
fast
machine
des
has
possible
keys
each
two
of
which
are
simply
to
convert
into
each
other
so
you
have
to
expect
trial
encryptions
in
the
mean
case
assuming
known
plaintext
is
ca
so
you
must
have
managed
to
do
encryptions
per
microsecond
ce
infosys
builds
a
very
fast
des
chip
that
manages
encryptions
per
microsecond
yes
im
not
very
seriously
bothered
about
the
security
of
des
yet
though
you
might
prefer
to
use
triple
des
or
idea
both
of
which
use
more
key
bits
