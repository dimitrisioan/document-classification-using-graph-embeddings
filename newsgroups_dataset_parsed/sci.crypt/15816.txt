QUALCOMM
HAD
SPARE
CYCLES
IN
THE
DSPS
FOR
THEIR
NEW
CDMA
DIGITAL
CELLULAR
PHONES
THEY
WANTED
TO
PUT
STRONG
CRYPTO
INTO
THEM
SINCE
THEY
HAD
THE
CAPACITY
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECIDED
TO
DISCOURAGE
THEM
YOURE
BLOWING
SMOKE
QUALCOMM
WANTS
TO
SELL
TO
NICE
LUCRATIVE
OVERSEAS
MARKETS
LIKE
JAPAN
AND
THE
EC
THE
GOVERNMENT
TOLD
THEM
DONT
DO
ENCRYPTION
IF
YOU
EVER
HOPE
TO
EXPORT
THIS
TECHNOLOGY
THE
REASON
THAT
CDMA
DOESNT
HAVE
ENCRYPTION
IS
NOT
BECAUSE
THE
GMEN
CAME
AKNOCKING
AT
QUALCOMMS
DOOR
ITS
BECAUSE
QUALCOMM
DOESNT
THINK
THAT
THE
US
MARKET
FOR
DIGITAL
CELLULAR
IS
BIG
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
THIS
IS
JUST
THE
INTERNATIONAL
TRAFFIC
IN
ARMS
REGULATIONS
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
IF
YOU
DONT
BELIEVE
ME
CALL
QUALCOMM
AND
ASK
THEM
DONT
JUST
THROW
OUT
CONSPICRACY
THEORIES
AT

DONT
DO
IT
ON
SCICRYPTTHERE
ARE
WHOLE
OTHER

DEVOTED

KIND
OF

CLAPTRAP
ANY
NORMAL
COMPANY
TRYING
TO
PUT

OUT
WILL
LIKELY
GET
A
VISIT
FROM
THE
BOYS
IN
THE
DARK
SUITS
FROM
WASHINGTON
JUST
LIKE
QUALCOMM
DID
I
SUSPECT
THAT
COMPANIES
LIKE
CYLINK
ARE
TOLERATED
BECAUSE
THEIR
PRODUCTS
ARE
TOO
EXPENSIVE
HAH
THEYRE
NOT
THAT
MUCH
MORE
EXPENSIVE
BESIDES
IF
A
DRUG
DEALER
CAN
AFFORD
A
ROLEX
AND
A
MERCEDES
HE
CAN
DARN
WELL
AFFORD
CYLINK
PHONES
NO
CYLINK
SELLS
THEIR
PHONES
BECAUSE
THEYRE
WILLING
TO
MAKE
DIFFERENT
STUFF
FOR
DOMESTIC
USE
VS
EXPORT
QUALCOMM
ISNT
SO
CYLINK
MAKES
MONEYTHATS
CAPITALISM
COMRADE
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
WILL
BUILD
A
UNIT
TO
DO
ALL
THIS
BETTER
YET
PREHAPS
SOMEONE
WILL
PRODUCE
A

THAT

SOMEONE
THIS
AND
SOMEONE
THAT
IF
YOU
THINK
ITS
SO
EASY
WHY
ARE
YOU
WHINING
ON
THE
NET
INSTEAD
OF
GETTING
YOUR
BUTT
IN
GEAR
AND
WRITING
IT
YOUR

WOULD
BECOME
KNOWN
AND
LOVED
BY

BUT
NO
THAT
WOULD
