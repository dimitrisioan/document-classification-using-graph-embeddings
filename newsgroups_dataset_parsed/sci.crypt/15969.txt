JUST
CURIOUS
HOW
WOULD
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
SYSTEM
HANDLE
CONFERENCE
CALLS
ITS
NOT
CLIPPER
ITS
ANY
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEM
IVE
SEEN
A
NUMBER
OF
DESIGNS
THEY
GENERALLY
INVOLVE
A
MULTILINE
CLEARTEXT
BRIDGE
DEPENDING
ON
THE
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEM
SO
LONG
AS
EVERYONE
HAS
THE
SAME
KEY
IT
CAN
BE
DONE
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
WAS
USING
VAT
WHICH
IS
AN
INTERNET
AUDIO
TOOL
FOR
A
CONFERENCE
CALL
AND
WE
WERE
ENCRYPTING
THE
SESSION
UNFORTUNATELY
ONE
SITE
WAS
DOING
MORE
WORK
AND
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
CPU
FOR
IT
SO
IT
DIDNT
SOUND
ALL
THAT
GOOD
AT
A
DIFFERENT
SITE
SO
YOU
DONT
NECCESSARILY
HAVE
TO
HAVE
A
CLEARTEXT
BRIDGE
BUT
IF
YOU
DO
ITS
TOTALLY
INTERNAL
TO
ONE
OF
THE
SITES
