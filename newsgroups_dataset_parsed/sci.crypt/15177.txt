is
perceived
as
a
benign
but
intensely
ambitious
curious
and
driven
computer
user
who
explores
obscure

what
is
a
cypherpunk
from
the
charter
of
the
cypherpunk
mailing
list
cypherpunks
assume
privacy
is
a
good
thing
and
wish
there
were
more
of
it
cypherpunks
acknowledge
that
those
who
want
privacy
must
create
it
for
themselves
and
not
expect
governments
corporations
or
other
large
faceless
organizations
to
grant
them
privacy
out
of
beneficence
cypherpunks
know
that
people
have
been
creating
their
own
privacy
for
centuries
with
whispers
envelopes
closed
doors
and
couriers
cypherpunks
do
not
seek
to
prevent
other
people
from
speaking
about
their
experiences
or
their
opinions

what

is
steganography
or
the
techniques
for
not
only
pursuing
private
encrypted
communication
but
concealing
the
very
existence
of
the
communication
itself
many
new
possibilities
in
this
area
are
introduced
with
the
proliferation
of
computer
technology
for
example
it
is
possible
to
encode
messages
in
the
leastsignificant
bits
of
images
typically
the
most
noisy
in
addition
when
such
an
item
is
posted
in
a
public
place
such
as
a
newsgroup
virtually
untraceable
communication
can
take
place
between
sender
and
receiver
for
steganographic
communications
in
the
electronic
realm
one
another
possibility
is
setting
up
a
mailing
list
where
individual
messages
get
broadcast
to
the
entire
list
and
individual
users
decode
particular
messages
with
their
unique
key

what
is
security
through
obscurity
security
through
obscurity
refers
to
the
attempt
to
gain
protection
from
system
weaknesses
by
hiding
sensitive
information
or
programs
relating
to
them
for
example
a
company
may
not
make
public
information
on
its
softwares
encryption
techniques
to
evade
attacks
based
on
knowledge
of
it
another
example
would
be
concealing
data
on
the
existence
of
security
holes
or
bugs
in
operating
systems
or
some
reliance
may
be
made
on
the
fact
that
some
standard
or
mechanism
with
potential
problems
is
serious
because
they
are
not
widely
known
or
not
widely
used
this
argument
is
occasionally
applied
to
mechanisms
for
email
and
usenet
posting
forgery
security
through
obscurity
is
regarded
as
a
very
feeble
technique
at
best
and
inappropriate
and
ineffective
at
worst

digitized
information
is
very
hard
to
stamp
classified
or
keep
contained
this
stuff
is
incredibly
leaky
and
volatile
its
almost
a
life
form
in
its
ability
to
selfpropagate
if
something
hits
the
net
and
its
something
which
people
on
there
find
interesting
it
will
spread
like
a
virus
of
the
mind
i
believe
you
must
simply
accept
the
idea
that
we
are
moving
into
an
environment
where
any
information
which
is
at
all
interesting
to
people
is
going
to
get
out
and
there
will
be
very
little
that
you
can
do
about
it
this
is
not
a
bad
thing
in
my
view

you
may
differ

the

the

providers

services
and
private
branch
exchange

shall
provide
within

thwarted
by
s
steele
in
boardwatch
magazine
feb
p
in
a
move
that
worried
privacy
experts
software
manufacturers
and
telephone
companies
the
fbi
proposed
legislation
to
amend
the
communications
act
of
to
make
it
easier
for
the
bureau
to
perform
electronic
wiretapping
the
proposed
legislation
entitled
digital
telephony
would
have
required
communications
service
providers
and
hardware
manufacturers
to
make
their
systems
tappable
by
providing
back
doors
through
which
law
enforcement
officers
could
intercept
communications
furthermore
this
capability
would
have
been
provided
undetectably
while
the
communications
was
in
progress
exclusive
of
any
communications
between
other
parties
regardless
of
the
mobility
of
the
target
of
the
fbis
investigation
and
without
degradation
of
service
under
the
proposal
the
department
of
justice
doj
can
keep
communications
products
off
the
market
if
it
determines
that
these
products
do
not
meet
the
dojs
own
guidelines
this
could
result
in
increased
costs
and
reduced
competitiveness
for
service
providers
and
equipment
manufacturers
since
they
will
be
unlikely
to
add
any
features
that
may
result
in
a
doj
rejection
of
their
entire
product
the
fbi
proposal
suggests
that
the
cost
of
this
wiretapping
service
to
the
bureau
would
have
to
be
borne
by
the
service
provider
itself

the

how
internet
anarchy
like
the
english
language
according
to
bruce
sterling
bruceswellsfcaus
the
internets
anarchy
may
seem
strange
or
even
unnatural
but
it
makes
a
certain
deep
and
basic
sense
its
rather
like
the
anarchy
of
the
english
language
nobody
rents
english
and
nobody
owns
english
as
an
englishspeaking
person
its
up
to
you
to
learn
how
to
speak
english
properly
and
make
whatever
use
you
please
of
it
though
the
government
provides
certain
subsidies
to
help
you
learn
to
read
and
write
a
bit
otherwise
everybody
just
sort
of
pitches
in
and
somehow
the
thing
evolves
on
its
own
and
somehow
turns
out
workable
and
interesting
fascinating
even
though
a
lot
of
people
earn
their
living
from
using
and
exploiting
and
teaching
english
english
as
an
institution
is
public
property
a
public
good
much
the
same
goes
for
the
internet
would
english
be
improved
if
the
the
english
language
inc
had
a
board
of
directors
and
a
chief
executive
officer
or
a
president
and
a
congress
thered
probably
be
a
lot
fewer
new
words
in
english
and
a

fewer
new
