in
this
giant
ballyho
over
this
clipper
chip
i
noticed
a
rather
disturbing
trend
in
some
of
the
email
and
posts
ive
tossing
back
and
forth
me
too
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
some
people
to
hide
their
head
in
the
sand
the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a
new
civil
war
how
many
people
do
you
want
jailed
for
their
convictions
for
their
insistence
on
real
privacy
why
sit
by
quietly
while
the
preconditions
for
a
real
civil
war
are
put
in
place
by
a
shortsighted
government
everybody
is
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going
to
reach
for
their
hammers
and
rifles
before
their
pens
and
paper
the
terminal
is
mightier
than
the
pen
can
people
work
within
the
system
before
trying
to
break
it
examine
your
history
books
and
find
out
how
many
armed
revolutions
led
to
democratic
or
democratic
style
governments
i
think
youll
only
find
one
in
over
five
thousand
years
of
written
history
really
i
guess
you
mean
the
us
revolution
how
about
england
india
mexico
france
holland
thats
not
very
good
odds
you
are
misinformed
but
this
whole
issue
is
off
the
topic
somebody
once
said
something
like
armed
violence
is
meant
only
to
be
used
in
response
to
an
armed
attack
it
is
not
meant
to
be
used
in
agression
this
is
the
difference
between
selfdefence
and
murder
when
the
cops
kick
in
your
door
for
using
pgp
tell
them
that
all
were
doing
here
is
exercising
our
socalled
rapidly
narrowing
right
to
free
speech
im
probably
overreacting
but
what
ive
read
scared
me
a
lot
i
dont
want
my
children
growing
up
in
a
war
zone
perhaps
you
should
talk
to
the
government
about
that
or
are
you
a
disciple
of
david
the
cops
are
our
friends
sternlight
the
implied
threat
of
the
illegalization
of
private
crypto
the
notsosubtle
subtext
of
the
clipper
announcement
is
what
worries
me
i
dont
want
my
children
growing
up
in
a
police
