and
since
the
us
constitutions
guarantees
the
right
to
every
american
to
bear
arms
why
is
not
every
american
entitled
as
a
matter
of
have
you
read
the
applicable
part
of
the
constitution
and
interpreted
it
in
context
if
not
please
do
so
before
posting
this
misinterpretation
again
it
refers
to
the
right
of
the
people
to
organize
a
militia
not
for
individuals
to
carry
handguns
grenades
and
assault
rifles
read
the
constitution
yourself
the
second
amendment
says
the
right
to
bear
arms
shall
not
be
infringed
so
a
well
regulated
militia
may
be
more
easily
formed
i
have
an
interpretation
of
the
second
that
shows
there
are
no
qualifications
to
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
if
you
want
i
can
email
it

you

mr
ward
before
you
start
blathering
about
your
skill
interpreting
the
constitution
it
might
be
helpful
to
learn
to
read
after
a
review
with
a
high
school
english
teacher
emphasizing
participial
phrases
you
might
start
with
the
second
amendment
and
follow
it
up
with
congress
session
committee
print
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
of
the
subcomittee
on
the
constitution
of
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
united
states
senate
congress
second
session
february
gpo
no
this
authoritative
heavily
researched
and
annotated
document
clearly
turns
your
interpretation
into
specious
claptrap
which
is
a
polite
way
of
saying
utter
bullshit
in
spite
of
your
false
assertion
to
the
contrary
the
second
amendment
does
protect
the
right
of
the
individual
citizen
in
his
capacity
as
an
individual
to
keep
and
bear
arms
and
mr
holland
imho
blatantly
and
harmfully
false
information
asserted
as
fact
and
globally
distributed
deserves
globally
distributed
rebuttal
in
the
forum
in
which
it
is
posted
and
besides
this
site
doesnt
carry
tpg
harrybphreddataiocom
phredharrybdataiocom
no
free
man
shall
ever
be
debarred
the
use
of
arms
the
strongest
reason
for
the
people
to
retain
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
as
a
last
resort
to
protect
themselves
against
tyranny

government
