RE
AN
OPEN
LETTER
TO
MR
CLINTON
IN
ARTICLE
MBECKMANMBECKMANCOM
WRITES
AS
AN
ECONOMIST
IM
SURE
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
FLAWS
IN
THIS
LOGIC
IF
THE
NAIVE
MARKET
IS
FLOODED
WITH
PROPRIETARY
BUT
WEAK
ENCRYPTION
THEN
TRULY
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
WILL
BE
UNABLE
TO
COMPETE
THIS
IS
TRUE
FOR
THE
MASS
MARKET
BUT
NOT
FOR
THOSE
WHO
NEED
STRONG
CRYPTO
AND
ARE
WILLING
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
AFTER
ALL
ONE
CAN
BUY
STRONG
CRYPTO
TODAY
IF
ONE
IS
WILLING
TO
SPEND
ENOUGH
THUS
THE
CONCERN
IS
NOT
ECONOMIC
THE
ISSUE
MOST
WORTH
WORRYING
ABOUT
IS
THAT
AFTER
THE
SYSTEM
TAKES
HOLD
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
OUTLAW
OTHER
SYSTEMS
AND
SOMETHING
VOLUNTARY
WILL
BECOME
THE
ONLY
SYSTEM
AVAILABLE
THAT
IS
A
POLITICAL
NOT
AN
ECONOMIC
ISSUE
AS
A
SEPARATE
MATTER
YOU
MAY
BE
MAKING
AN
IMPLIED
ADVOCACY
FOR
CHEAP
SECURE
CRYPTO
FOR
EVERYONE
ITS
TRUE
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
WOULD
PROBABLY
PREVENT
THAT
EXCEPT
VIA
CLIPPER
BUT
CHEAP
SECURE
CRYPTO
FOR
EVERYONE
IS
A
POLITICAL
DISCUSSION
NOT
AN
ECONOMIC
ONE
AND
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
CLIPPER
IS
TO
RESOLVE
THAT
POLITICAL
POLICY
TENSION
BETWEEN
SECURING
LEGITIMATE
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
TAPPING
THE
CROOKS
