UNIACSBUEDU

WRITES
I
WISH
I
COULD
AGREE
WITH
YOU
ASK
YOURSELF
THIS
WHY
WOULD
ANY
PRIVATE
SECTOR
ENTITY
WISH
TO
BUY
A
CRYPTO
SYSTEM
THAT
WAS
KNOWN
TO
BE
AT
LEAST
PARTIALLY
COMPROMISED
A
TO
USE
FOR
SENSITIVE
BUT
NOT
STRATEGICALLY
IMPORTANT
TRAFFIC
B
IF
THE
SYSTEM
WAS
CHEAP
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
DONT
OWN
A
CORDLESS
PHONE
WITH
CLIPPER
I
WOULD
IF
THE
LOCAL
MEN
IN
BLUE
REALLY
WANT
TO
LISTEN
TO
ME
TALK
TO
MY
FRIENDS
OR
ORDER
PIZZA
IM
NO
WORSE
OFF
THAN
I
AM
NOW
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
LOCAL
KIDS
OR
NOSY
NEIGHBORS
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
CLIPPER
RAISES
THE
BAR
ON
INSECURE
CHANNELS
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
THEM
SECURE
BY
ANY
MEANS
BUT
A
WALL
EVEN
IF
THE
FBI
CAN
GET
A
MASTER
KEY
BY
COURT
ORDER
IS
STILL
BETTER
THAN
A
KEEP
OFF
THE
GRASS
SIGN
THE
ANSWER
SEEMS
OBVIOUS
TO
ME
THEY
WOULDNT
THERE
IS
OTHER
HARDWARE
OUT
THERE
NOT
COMPROMISED
DES
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
TRIPLE
DES
AS
A
BETTER
ONE
SO
WHERE
CAN
I
BUY
A
DESENCRYPTED
CELLULAR
PHONE
HOW
MUCH
DOES
IT
COST
PERSONALLY
CYLINK
STUFF
IS
OUT
OF

HOW
CAN
YOU
RECONCILE

SELF
PROCLAIMED
PURPOSE
OF

WITH
