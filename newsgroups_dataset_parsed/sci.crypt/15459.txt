BRAD
TEMPLETON
WRITES
THEIR
STRATEGY
IS
A
BUSINESS
ONE
RATHER
THAN
LEGAL
ONE
THEY
ARE
PUSHING
TO
GET
A
STANDARD
IN
PLACE
A
SECRET
STANDARD
AND
IF
THEY
GET
IT
AS
A
STANDARD
THEN
THEY
WILL
DRIVE
COMPETITORS
OUT
OF
THE
MARKET
IT
WILL
BE
LEGAL
TO
SELL
BETTER
UNTAPABLE
ENCRYPTION
THAT
DOESNT
HAVE
REGISTERED
KEYS
BUT
IT
WILL
BE
DIFFICULT
AND
THUS
NOT
A
PLAN
FOR
MOST
PHONE
COMPANIES
IF
BRADS
ANALYSIS
IS
CORRECT
IT
MAY
OFFER
AN
EXPLANATION
FOR
WHY
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
IS
BEING
KEPT
SECRET
THIS
WILL
PREVENT
COMPETITORS
FROM
COMING
OUT
WITH
CLIPPERCOMPATIBLE
PHONES
WHICH
LACK
THE
GOVERNMENT
INSTALLED
BACK
DOOR
THE
STRATEGY
BRAD
DESCRIBES
WILL
ONLY
WORK
AS
LONG
AS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
GET
COMPATIBLE
PHONES
IS
TO
HAVE
ONES
WITH
THE
GOVERNMENT
CHIPS
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
PERSONAL
PRIVACY
IF
BRAD
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
RIGHT
AS
LONG
AS
PEOPLE
STILL
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
PROVIDE
THEIR
OWN
ENCRYPTION
IN
PLACE
OF
OR
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
CLIPPER
PRIVACY
IS
STILL
POSSIBLE
BUT
THE
WORDING
OF
SEVERAL
PASSAGES
IN
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
MAKES
ME
DOUBT
WHETHER
THIS
WILL
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
TRUE
EVEN
IF
WHAT
BRAD
SAYS
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
ACCURATE
YOU
CAN
BET
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATION
WILL
HAVE
MADE
IT
VERY
CLEAR
TO
THE
VENDORS
THAT
IT
WOULD
VERY
MUCH
BE
IN
THEIR
BEST
INTERESTS
TO
INSTITUTE
A
VOLUNTARY
POLICY
OF
REFUSING
TO
SELL
ANYTHING
BUT
CLINTON
CRIPPLE
EQUIPPED
EQUIPMENT
TO
ANYONE
OTHER
THAN
AUTHORIZED
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
AND
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OR
INDIVIDUALS
AND
CORPORATIONS
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
BEEN
DETERMINED
BY
THE
ADMINISTRATION
TO
HAVE
A
VALID
NEED
ON
A
CASEBYCASE
BASIS
FOR
AN
EFFECTIVE
SYSTEM
NOTE
THAT
THIS
IS
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
THE
LANGUAGE
USED
IN
MANY
GUN
CONTROL
BILLSLAWS
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
PUSHING
FOR
OR
OTHERWISE
SUPPORTING
THE
LOGIC
AND
ACTUAL
RATIONALE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
EXCUSES
THAT
GET
FED
TO
THE
MEDIA
IS
THE
SAME
IN
BOTH
CASES
ONLY
THE
ITEMS
OR
TECHNOLOGY
IN
QUESTION
ARE
DIFFERENT
I
THINK
THIS
IS
NO
ACCIDENT
IT
COMES
FROM
THE
SAME
PHILOSOPHY
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
RULESCONTROLS
THE
PEOPLE
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
CONTROLLING
THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT
THE
UNCONNECTED
CITIZENS
ARE
NOT
SOPHISTICATED
ENOUGH
TO
KNOW
WHAT
IS
BEST
FOR
THEM
SO
THE
GOVERNMENT
MUST
TELL
THE
PEOPLE
WHAT
THEY
NEED
OR
DO
NOT
NEED
WE
KNOW
BEST
AND
THE
IDEA
THAT
THAT
A
COMMONER
CAN
DEFEND
HIMSELF
AGAINST
GOVERNMENT
EAVESDROPPING
OR
UNLAWFUL
ATTACK
IS
TOTALLY
UNACCEPTABLE
TO
PEOPLE
WITH
THIS
OUTLOOK
HAL
FINNEY
COMBINE
THIS
ALL
WITH
PUSHING
FOR
NATIONAL
IDENTITY
CARDS
WITH
SMART
CHIPS
TO
ENCODE
ANYTHING
THEY
PLEASE
INTERNAL
PASSPORT
UNDER
THE
GUISE
OF
STREAMLINING
THE
STATE
PEOPLES
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
AND
WITH
YOU
CAN
BE
CERTAIN
MORE
JEWELS
YET
TO
COME
AND
ONE
SEES
AN
EXTREMELY
OMINOUS
TREND
SO
WHAT
IF
WILL
BE
TEN
YEARS
LATE
IT
STILL
IS
TURNING
OUT
TO
BE
AN
AMAZINGLY
ACCURATE
PROPHECY
UNLESS
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WAKE
UP
AND
IN
A
HURRY
ONE
SHOULD
ALWAYS
HAVE
EVERY
RED
WARNING
LIGHT
AND
BELL
AND
DANGER
FLAG
COME
UP
WHEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
SEEKS
TO
SET
ITSELF
APART
IN
REGARD
TO
RIGHTS
ETC
FROM
THE
UNCONNECTEDUNPRIVILEGED
CITIZEN
OR
SHOULD
WE
NOW
BE
SAYING
SUBJECT
INSTEAD
WHY
SHOULDNT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
HAVE
A
GOOD
SECURE
SYSTEM
OF
DATA
SECURITY
NOT
DEPENDENT
ON
NEBULOUS
SAFEGUARDS
FOR
MAINTAINING
THAT
SECURITY
WHY
SHOULDNT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
BE
ABLE
TO
DEFEND
HIMSELF
FROM
AN
AGENCY
GONE
ROGUE
AM
SURE
THE
FEDS
COULD
BREAK
INTO
ANY
DATA
THEY
REALLY
WANTED
TO
BUT
IT
WOULD
TAKE
SOME
WORK
AND
USING
THE
SAME
LOGIC
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
A
GOOD
SAFE
UNLESS
A
DUPLICATE
OF
THE
KEYS
OR
COMBINATION
ARE
SUBMITTED
FOR
SAFEKEEPING
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
I
DONT
REALLY
SEE
A
DIFFERENCE
PHILOSOPHICALLY
ENCRYPTED
DATA
SURE
WONT
EVAPORATE
NOT
WITH
SUCH
HIGHTECH
TOOLS
AS
