this

last

april
in

requests
i
have
assembled
this
list
of
largeinteger
arithmetic
packages
of
which
i
have
heard
most
of
these
are
c
function
libraries
available
in
source
form
for
your
convenience
i
have
placed
copies
of
some
of
these
on
ripemmsuedu
they
are
available
for
anonymous
ftp
in
the
directory
pubbignum
however
what
i
have
may
not
be
the
most
current
version
in
all
cases
here
they
are
in

the

i
have

get
by
this
is
the
only
of
these

that
i
have
actually
used
it
works
well
and
is
very
portable
i
havent
done
any
benchmarks
against
the
others
but
the
code
looks
clever
lenstra
is
an
accomplished
number

unlike
the
other

here
this
one

you
