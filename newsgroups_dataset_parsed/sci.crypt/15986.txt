I
NOTICED
A
RATHER
DISTURBING
TREND
IN
SOME
OF
THE
EMAIL
AND

IVE
TOSSING
BACK
AND
FORTH
DELETED
A
CIRCUT
COURT
JUDGE
IN
ILLINOIS
ONCE
SAID
WHEN
DEALING
WITH
A
GOVERNMENT
THAT
SEEKS
CONTINUALLY
NEW
AND
MORE
CREATIVE
WAYS
TO
SPY
ON
ITS
CITIZENRY
ONE
CANNOT
DISCOURAGE
THE
MOVE
TO
EMPOWER
THE
COMMON
CITIZEN
WITH
THE
MEANS
TO
PARRY
THIS
ATTACK
ON
PERSONAL
PRIVACY
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
COMMENT
WAS
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
BANNING
OF
RADAR
DETECTORS
THE
POINT
REMAINS
MORE
AND
MORE
I
SEE
THE
GOVERNMENT
SLOWLY
WASHING
AWAY
PRIVACY
EVEN
UNWITTINGLY
DO
YOU
THINK
I
WILL
EVER
LIVE
IN
A
SOCEITY
THAT
ISSUES
SMART
CARDS
TO
CITIZENS
AT
BIRTH
DO
YOU
THINK
I
WILL
LIVE
IN
A
SOCEITY
THAT
INSISTS
I
REGISTER
MY
CRYPTO
KEYS
SO
THEY
CAN
KEEP
TRACK
OF
WHAT
IM
SAYING
EVEN
IF
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
MY
GUILT
DO
YOU
THINK
I
WILL
EVER
LIVE
IN
A
SOCEITY
THAT
SEEKS
TO
MEDDLE
IN
THE
AFFAIRS
OF
ITS
CITIZENRY
WITHOUT
RECOURSE
OF
ANY
KIND
IM
TIRED
OF
IT
THERE
IS
IMHO
NO
COMPROMISE
WITH
AN
ADMINISTRATION
THAT
SEEKS
TO
IMPLEMENT
THESE
PROPOSALS
UNDER
THE
GUISE
OF
ENHANCING
PRIVACY
MORE
THAN
THE
PROPOSALS
THEMSELVES
I
READ
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
THE
PRESS
RELEASES
THE
OBVIOUS
DECEPTION
INVOLVED
IN
PRESENTING
THESE
PIECES
TO
THE
PUBLIC
AND
I
AM
SICKENED
I
AM
REVOLTED
I
AM
REPULSED
PERHAPS
EVEN
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
COULD
CARE
LESS
ABOUT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
THE
WIRETAP
BILL
THE
SMART
CARD
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
SO
ENTRAPPED
IN
THE
RHETORIC
OF
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
HAVING
THE
SCOPE
OR
IMPLICATAIONS
POINTED
OUT
TO
THEM
HELL
MOST
HAVENT
EVEN
HEARD
OF
CLIPPER
AND
WHEN
THEY
DO
IT
WILL
BE
IN
SOOTHING
LANGUAGE
TELLING
EVERYONE
HOW
NICE
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
AT
LETTING
THEM
HAVE
PRIVACY
HOW
COME
THE
MEDIA
IS
NOT
TELLING
ABOUT
THE
PROVISIONS
OF
THE
CLIPPER
DECISION
THE
PROVISIONS
OF
THE
CRIME
BILL
THE
ABUSES
OF
CIVIL
FORFEITURE
THE
GOVERNMENT
USES
POLLS
TO
SUPPORT
PERCENT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WANT
GUN
BANS
ETC
YET
THE
SAME
POLLSTERS
HAVE
DETERMINED
ACCORDING
TO
THE
MEDIA
THAT
PERCENT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
UNAWARE
OF
WHAT
THE
HOLOCAUST
IS
THE
PEOPLE
CANNOT
BE
EXPECTED
TO
GIVE
DECENT
DECISIONS
WHEN
THEY
ARE
DENIED
THE
INFORMATION
THAT
ALL
THESE
ABUSES
AND
WHITTLING
AWAY
OF
RIGHTS
ARE
GOING
ON
QUIETLY
WHEN
THEY
FIND
OUT
WHEN
IT
HITS
THEM
IT
WILL
BE
TOO
LATE
ONE
CANNOT
EXPECT
EACH
CITIZEN
TO
SPEND
ALL
THEIR
TIME
PROBING
SEARCHING
RESEARCHING
ETC
FOR
EXAMPLE
HOW
BIG
A
PERCENTAGE
OF
THE
AVERAGE
POPULATION
EVEN
HAS
ACCESS
TO
USENET
WAY
LESS
THAN
PERCENT
I
BET
HOW
MANY
OUTSIDE
OF
INTERNETUSENET
ARE
EVEN
AWARE
OF
WHAT
BIG
BROTHER
IS
DOING
OR
HAVE
BEEN
EXPOSED
TO
ARGUMENTS
OF
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
ISSUE
WHAT
THE
PUBLIC
WILL
GET
IS
ONLY
ONE
SIDE
THE
GOVERNMENTS
SIDE
THAT
IS
SCARY
THIS
SADDENS
AND
FRIGHTENS
ME
I
AM
A
CONSERVEATIVE
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
A
LAW
AND
ORDER
CONSERVEATIVE
BUT
THE
MOVE
TO
A
CENTRALIZED
AUTHORATARIAN
REGIME
REALLY
SCARES
ME
MOSTLY
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
YOU
CANT
GO
FAR
WRONG
UNDERESTIMATING
THE
INTELLIGENCE
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
TELL
THEM
ITS
GOING
TO
KEEP
THEM
SAFE
FROM
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
TERRORISTS
AND
THEY
WILL
LET
YOU
PUT
CAMERAS
IN
THEIR
HOME
HOW
CAN
THE
BULK
OF
THE
PEOPLE
BE
INFORMED
WHEN
THE
MEDIA
REFUSES
TO
DO
IT
EVEN
IN
THE
WAKE
OF
WACO
YOU
FIND
THOSE
WHO
SUPPORT
THE
INCREASINGLY
TOTALATARIAN
MOVES
SOMEBODY
ONCE
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
ARMED
VIOLENCE
IS
MEANT
ONLY
TO
BE
USED
IN
RESPONSE
TO
AN
ARMED
ATTACK
IT
IS
NOT
MEANT
TO
BE
USED
IN
AGRESSION
THIS
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
SELFDEFENCE
AND
MURDER
TO
BE
QUITE
HONEST
THE
WAY
THINGS
ARE
GOING
ID
CALL
IT
SELF
DEFENSE
LETS
TRY
TO

THERES
ENOUGH
BLOOD

IM
PROBABLY
OVERREACTING
BUT
WHAT

SCARED
ME
A

I
DONT

I
DONT

IN

A

THE
PEOPLE
AT

NEED
TO
BE
INFORMED
BUT
HOW
I
AM
