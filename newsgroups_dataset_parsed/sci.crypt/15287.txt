ROBERT
CRAWFORD
WRITES
JAY
FENTON
FENTONKALEIDACOM
WRITES
HOW
CAN
THE
GOVERNMENT
TELL
WHICH
ENCRYPTION
METHOD
ONE
IS
USING
WITHOUT
BEING
ABLE
TO
DECODE
THE
TRAFFIC
IE
IN
ORDER
TO
ACCUSE
ME
OF
USING
AN
UNAUTHORIZED
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
TECHNIQUE
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
TAKE
BOTH
KEYS
OUT
OF
ESCROW
RUN
THEM
AGAINST
MY
CIPHERTEXT
AND
DRAW
A
BLANK
I
WAS
THINKING
ABOUT
THIS
ALSO
ITS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THE
SYSTEM
TRANSMITS
IN
CLEAR
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
OF
THE
DEVICE
BEING
USED
THAT
WAY
THEY
CAN
START
A
TAP
GET
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
AND
USE
THE
WARRANT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TAP
TO
GET
THE
KEY
IF
THEY
TAP
SOMEONE
WHOS
APPARENTLY
USING
ENCRYPTION
BUT
DONT
FIND
THAT
PREFIX
THEN
THEYLL
ASSUME
ITS
AN
UNAUTHORIZED
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
FROM
THE
LIMITED
DETAILS
RELEASED
SO
FAR
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
SYSTEM
MUST
EMPLOY
SOME
SORT
OF
PUBLIC
KEY
CRYPTOGRAPHY
OTHERWISE
THE
KEY
MANAGEMENT
PROBLEMS
INHERENT
TO
SYMETRIC
CIPHERS
WOULD
MAKE
THE
SYSTEM
UNWORKABLE
IT
PROBABLY
HAS
SOME
SORT
OF
PUBLIC
KEY
EXCHANGE
THAT
TAKES
PLACE
AT
THE
START
OF
EACH
CALL
THATS
HOW
THEY
WOULD
IDENTIFY
THE
PRIVATE
KEY
IN
THEIR
DATA
BASE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
EITHER
THE
NSA
HAS
DEVELOPED
SOME
NON
RSA
PUBLIC
KEY
ALGORYTHM
OR
THE
FEDS
HAVE
DECIDED
TO
SUBSIDIZE
PKP
RSADSI
THE
FORMER
IS
RATHER
AN
EXCITING
POSIBILITY
SINCE
KEEPING
THE
ALGORYTHM
SECRET
WHILE
MAKING
CHIP
IMPLIMENTATIONS
WIDELY
AVALIBE
WILL
BE
EXCEPTIONALLY
HARD
IF
THE
FEDS
ARE
FORCED
TO
MAKE
IT
AVALIBLE
IN
ORDER
TO
GAIN
PUBLIC
ACCEPTANCE
THAN
THAT
COULD
BREAK
RSAS
STRANGLEHOLD
ON
PUBLIC
KEY
CRYPTO
IN
THE
US
AS
FOR
MY
IMPRESSIONS
OF
THE
WHOLE
SCHEME
IT
SEEMS
THAT
INSTEAD
OF
TRYING
TO
BAN
STRONG
CRYPTO
THEY
ARE
TRYING
TO
COOPT
IT
THEIR
CONTENTION
THAT
THEY
NEED
TO
KEEP
THE
ALGORYTHM
SECRET
TO
PROTECT
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
KEY
REGISTRATION
SUGGESTS
POSSIBLE
INHERENT
WEAKNESS
TO
THE
ALGORYTHM
MORE
LIKELY
IS
THAT
THEY
DONT
WANT
ANYONE
CONSTRUCTING
BLACK
MARKET
DEVICES
WHICH
DONT
HAVE
THE
KEYS
REGISTERED
ANYONE
ELSE
NOTICE
THAT
IN
THEIR
QA
SESSION
THEY
TALK
ABOUT
RELEASING
THE
KEYS
ONLY
TO
PEOPLE
WITH
PROPER
AUTIORIZATION
BUT
CAREFULLY
DANCE
AROUND
STATING
THAT
THE
KEYS
WILL
SIMPLY
HAVE
TO
BE
SUPEONAED
THEY
SEEM
TO
BE
TRYING
TO
KEEP
OPEN
THE
POSIBILITY
OF
OBTAINING
KEYS
WITHOUT
COURT
ORDER
EVEN
THOUGH
TAPPING
A
PHONE
LINE
REQUIRES
ONE
ALSO
PICK
UP
ON
THEIR
IMPLICIT
THREAT
OF
EITHE
ACCEPT
THIS
OR
WELL
BAN
STRONG
CRYPTO
OUTRIGHT
I
DONT
TRUST
THIS
PLAN
AT
ALL
AND
PLAN
TO
OPPOSE
IT
IN
ALL
LEGAL
WAYS
POSSIBLE
