RE
HELP
SOME
NUT
IS
THREATENING
TO
SUE
I
DONT
WISH
TO
REHASH
THE
PGP
PATENT
ISSUE
AT
ALL
BUT
I
DO
FEEL
THAT
SOME
POTENTIAL
MISCONCEPTIONS
IN
INTERPRETTING
INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY
LAWS
NEED
TO
BE
RAISED
IN
ARTICLE
ARTHUR
RUBIN
WRITES
IF
PGP
VIOLATES
RSAS
PATENTS
THEN
ONLY
EXECUTING
PGP
COULD
BE
A
VIOLATION
DISTRIBUTING
PGP
COULD
BE
CONTRIBUTORY
INFRINGEMENT
BUT
THE
PGP
DOCUMENTATION
SEEMED
SUFFICIENT
TO
ME
TO
PROTECT
DISTRIBUTORS
BEFORE
I
DELETED
IT
USING
PGP
MIGHT
BE
A
PATENT
VIOLATION
IN
THE
US
SO
I
HAVE
NO
NEED
TO
KEEP
IT
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
THAT
EXECUTING
PGP
WOULD
BE
A
VIOLATION
UNLESS
THE
PATENT
WERE
DECLARED
INVALID
BY
THE
COURTS
BUT
THERE
IS
A
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHEN
HOW
OR
IF
DISTRIBUTING
PGP
WOULD
BE
A
VIOLATION
IF
THE
PERSON
OR
COMPANY
DISTRIBUTING
PGP
RECEIVES
MONEY
FOR
DOING
SO
THEN
IT
IS
CLEARLY
A
SALE
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
IT
WERE
ON
COMPUSERVE
THEY
CHARGE
YOU
FOR
ACCESS
SO
THEY
WOULD
BE
SELLING
PGP
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
CHARGE
FOR
PGP
THINGS
GET
LESS
CLEAR
BUT
THERE
WOULD
STILL
BE
A
REASONABLE
VIEW
THAT
IT
IS
INDUCING
AN
INFRINGEMENT
NB
RE
JIM
BIDZOS
YOU
HAVE
NO
LEGAL
ACTION
YOU
CAN
TAKE
UNLESS
YOU
BELIEVE
YOU
CAN
PROVE
SOMEONE
IS
USING
PGP
IN
THE
US
FOR
A
PURPOSE
OTHER
THAN
THAT
SPECIFICALLY
ALLOWED
BY
PATENT
LAWS
NOT
ENTIRELY
CORRECT
ANYONE
CAN
SUE
FOR
ANY
REASON
BUT
YOU
CANNOT
PREVAIL
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
PROVE
THAT
BY
A
PREPODERANCE
OF
EVIDENCE
UNDER
PATENT
LAWS
PGP
DOES
HAVE
LEGITIMATE
USES
AS
A
MEANS
TO
STUDY
YOUR
ALGORITHM
IN
ORDER
TO
PRODUCE
IMPROVEMENTS
WHICH
WOULD
STILL
REQUIRE
YOUR
APPROVAL
TO
EXECUTE
UNTIL
THE
PATENT
RUNS
OUT
AROUND
THIS
IS
A
COMMON
MISCONCEPTION
THE
PATENT
LAWS
DO
NOT
MENTION
ANY
VALID
PURPOSE
FOR
INFRINGING
A
PATENT
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
IN
ORDER
TO
CREATE
A
NEW
INVENTION
EITHER
BASED
ON
A
PRIOR
PATENT
OR
TO
AVOID
INFRINGING
A
PRIOR
PATENT
ONE
MUST
PERFORM
RESEARCH
ON
AN
EXISTING
PATENT
TO
JUST
SAY
THAT
YOU
INFRINGED
A
PATENT
ASSUME
WERE
NOT
TALKING
THE
RSA
PATENT
ONLY
FOR
RESEARCH
PURPOSES
WINK
WINK
NUDGE
NUDGE
AND
THEN
NEVER
DEVELOP
ANY
RELATED
INVENTION
IE
ONLY
USE
IT
WOULD
BE
A
CLEAR
INFRINGEMENT
