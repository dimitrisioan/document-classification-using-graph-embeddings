WIRETAPPING
REALITY
TODAY
STRNLGHTNETCOMCOM
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WRITES
SOME
OF
THE
MESSAGES
HERE
SEEM
TO
REFLECT
THE
VIEW
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
LISTENING
IN
ON
EVERYTHING
AND
ONE
WILL
HAVE
TO
HIDE
ONES
CLIPPER
MESSAGES
SOMEHOW
IF
NONESCROWED
CRYPTO
GOES
AWAY
A
LITTLE
PERSPECTIVE
MIGHT
BE
IN
ORDER
THE
NUMBER
OF
COURT
ORDERED
WIRE
TAPS
IS
PRETTY
LOW
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
HAS
TO
PRESENT
PRETTY
GOOD
EVIDENCE
TO
GET
EVEN
THAT
LIMITED
NUMBER
OF
AUTHORIZATIONS
THUS
THE
OVERWHELMING
MAJORITY
OF
CONVERSATIONS
ARE
NEITHER
TAPPED
NOR
RECORDED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
FOR
THAT
TO
HAPPEN
THEY
HAVE
TO
A
HAVE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
REASON
WITH
EVIDENCE
B
USE
THIS
SPARINGLY
ON
HIGHEST
PRIORITY
PRETTY
GOOD
REASONS
THOUGH
THE
SYSTEM
MAY
BE
IMPERFECT
IT
IS
A
LONG
WAY
FROM
THE
HORROR
STORIES
SOME
HERE
SEEM
TO
BELIEVE
OR
ANTICIPATE
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
GREAT
CARE
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
TO
ENSURE
THE
ACCURACY
OF
OUR
INFORMATION
ERRORS
AND
OMISSIONS
EXCEPTED
AGAIN
WE
HAVE
THE
TRUST
IN
GOVERNMENT
PROBLEM
HERE
MEMBERS
OF
MR
STERNLIGHTS
GENERATION
TRUST
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
A
DEGREE
WHICH
MEMBERS
OF
MY
GENERATION
FIND
RIDICULOUS
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
MR
STERNLIGHT
READ
ABOUT
THE
COINTELPRO
PROGRAM
OR
ABOUT
J
EDGAR
HOOVER
OR
ABOUT
THE
WIRETAPPING
OF
MARTIN
LUTHER
KING
THEN
AFTER
HE
HAS
DIGESTED
THIS
INFORMATION
HE
CAN
PONDER
THE
FACT
THAT
WHILE
THE
GOVERNMENT
DOES
NOT
TAP
EVERY
CONVERSATION
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
RECORD
OF
TAPPING
MANY
CONVERSATIONS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
NO
RIGHT
TO
EVEN
UNDER
THEIR
OWN
LAWS
GIVEN
THE
LONG
HISTORY
OF
MEMBERS
OF
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
IGNORING
THE
LAWS
THAT
APPLY
TO
THEM
IT
IS
NO
WONDER
THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
HERE
SOUND
SO
PARANOID
AND
GIVEN
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
IS
OFTEN
DIFFICULT
OR
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
PUNISH
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
ONCE
THEY
ARE
DISCOVERED
IT
IS
NO
WONDER
THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
HERE
HAVE
SO
LITTLE
FAITH
IN
THE
ESCROW

FOR
CLIPPER
