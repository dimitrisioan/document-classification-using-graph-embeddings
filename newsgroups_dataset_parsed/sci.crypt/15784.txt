i
worked
for
previously
i
received
a
file
that
was
des
encryped
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
weeks
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
only
took
days
to
crack
the
file
no
i
dont
have
any
faith
in
des
taking
this
at
face
value
though
it
seems
quite
dissonant
with
much
else
that
has
been
published
here
about
brute
force
des
cracking
unless
russell
was
lucky
with
respect
to
the
key
id
be
very
interested
in
whether
the
program
russell
used
is
available
in
whether
he
used
a
cleartext
recognition
algorithm
in
the
program
or
whether
he
had
to
examine
each
decryption
by
hand
in
whether
he
used
a
known
plaintext
attack
given
that
certain
archival
methods
have
certain
keycleartext
in
a
file
i
used
a
programatic
dictionary
attack
i
used
the
des
library
provided
with
the
system
that
i
was
using
what
is
to
keep
anyone
from
being
lucky
with
a
key
he
probably
should
also
tell
us
given
his
address
what
machine
he
useda
desktop
workstation
or
supercomputer
my
previous
employment
has
nothing
to
do
with
my
current
address
other
than
the
fact
that
the
fastest
machine
in
the
office
was
an
ibm
risc
model
with
meg
of
memorynot
a
supercomputer
depending
on
his
answer
this
could
be
an
appalling
development
calling
into
question
both
des
and
rsades
dunno
about
rsaidea
i
really
think
this
more
of
a
statement
of
the
limitations
placed
on
the
key
by
the
interfaceascii
charno
padding
and
most
programs
dont
bother
to
clear
off
the
archival
front
and
backend
ids
if
any
bright
programmer
with
a
little
idle
machine
time
can
crack
a
single
des
message
in
a
couple
of
days
assuming
no
tricks
that
are
messagespecific
then
heres
my
clipper
key
nsa
give
me
the
chip
at
once
yes
any
moderatly
bright
programmer
with
a
little
idle
machine
time
can
crack
most
of
todays
real
world
encryption
i
sure
that
you
or
i
could
select
a
key
and
prepare
the
data
inorder
that
the
decryption
will
become
a
worst
case
but
that
is
not
the
real
world
and
im
sure
that
is
how
any
agency
would
start
an
attack
on
a
message
as
you
pointed
out
there
are
some
very
good
recognition
algorithms
availible
im
just
not
familiar
with
them
