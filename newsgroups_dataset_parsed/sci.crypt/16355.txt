YOU
KNOW
ALL
ABOUT
THE

BUT
HERES
A
QUESTION
I
HAVENT
SEEN
THE
ONETIMEPAD
YEILDS
IDEAL
SECURITY
BUT
HAS
A
WELLKNOWN
FLAW
IN
AUTHENTICATION
SUPPOSE
YOU
USE
A
RANDOM
BIT
STREAM
AS
THE
PAD
AND
EXCLUSIVEOR
AS
THE
ENCRYPTION
OPERATION
IF
AN
ADVERSARY
KNOWS
THE
PLAINTEXT
OF
A
MESSAGE
HE
CAN
CHANGE
IT
INTO
ANY
OTHER
MESSAGE
HERES
HOW
IT

THUS
RECEIVING
THE

WHICH
WAS
SUBSTITUTED

NOW
THE
QUESTION
IS
HOW
CAN
THIS
ATTACK
BE
DEFEATED
WITH
INFORMATION
THEORETIC
SECURITY
NOT
JUST
COMPUTATIONAL
SECURITY
CAN
WE
DEFINE
SOMETHING
LIKE
IDEAL
AUTHENTICATION
WHICH
IS
THE
ANALOG
OF
IDEAL
SECURITY
CAN
WE
OBTAIN
IDEAL
AUTHENTICATION
IF
NOT
HOW
MUCH
CAN
WE
LIMIT
EVES
CONTROL
OVER
THE
MESSAGE
IF
WE
CAN
ACHIEVE
IDEAL
AUTHENTICATION
DOES
THE
SOLUTION
USE
MORE
KEY
BITS
OR
EXPAND
THE
MESSAGE
CAN
WE
SHOW
THE
SOLUTION
TO
BE
OPTIMAL
IN

DOES
