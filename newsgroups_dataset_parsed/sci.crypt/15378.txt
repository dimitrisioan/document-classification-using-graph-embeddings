IF

THERE
MUST

IF

GENERATES
A

SENDS
IT
TO

THEN
WHATS
THE
POINT
OF
GOING
TO
THE
TROUBLE
OF
HAVING
SOME
COMPLICATED

JUST
ASK
THE

FOR
A

OF

FOR

NOW
ITS
PROBABLY
NOT
PRACTICAL
FOR
EACH
USER
TO
KEEP
AN
ONLINE
COPY
OF
EVERY
PUBLIC
KEY
USED
BY
ANYONE
ANYWHERE
RIGHT
SO
PROBABLY
THERE
WILL
BE
SOME
WAY
OF
GETTING
THESE

VERIFIED
THIS

BE
A

STORED

IT
MIGHT
ALSO
BE

THIS
WOULD
INTRODUCE
ANOTHER
WEAKNESS
TO
THE

OF

OF

PRESUMABLY
IF
YOU
DONT

YOUR
DESIGNATED

YOU
CANT
GET
A

CONNECTION
TO
OTHER
STANDARD
CHIPS
IT
MIGHT
BE
USEFUL
TO
HAVE
A
MODIFIED

WHICH
WOULD
ALLOW
YOU
TO

EITHER
THE
ORIGINAL

SOME

UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
