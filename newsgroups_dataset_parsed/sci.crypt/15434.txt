i
wish
i
could
agree
with
you
ask
yourself
this
why
would
any
private
sector
entity
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
was
known
to
be
at
least
partially
compromised
key
escrows
in
this
instance
why
would
any
private
sector
entity
wish
to
buy
a
crypto
system
that
had
not
been
properly
evaluated
ie
algorythm
not
publically
released
the
answer
seems
obvious
to
me
they
wouldnt
there
is
other
hardware
out
there
not
compromised
des
as
an
example
triple
des
as
a
better
one
what
follows
is
my
opinion
it
is
not
asserted
to
be
the
truth
so
no
flames
please
it
comes
out
of
a
background
of
years
as
a
senior
corporate
staff
executive
in
two
fortune
companies
no
wonder
american
businesses
are
going
down
the
tubes
id
be
happy
to
use
a
crypto
system
supplied
by
the
nsa
for
business
if
they
told
me
it
was
more
secure
than
des
and
in
particular
resistant
to
attempts
by
japanese
french
and
other
competitive
companies
and
governments
to
break
its
nist
not
nsa
nsa
is
not
supposed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
this
they
didnt
say
that
they
said
is
was
better
than
some
commercialgrade
encryptions
i
for
one
wouldnt
trust
them
if
they
did
unless
they
release
the
algorithm
for
investigation
id
be
happy
to
do
so
even
with
escrowed
keys
provided
i
was
happy
about
the
bona
fides
of
the
escrow
agencies
the
federal
reserve
would
certainly
satisfy
me
as
would
something
set
up
by
one
of
the
big
accounting
firms
maybe
the
aclu
and
eff
it
would
have
to
be
a
nonprofit
so
the
big
would
be
out
id
trust
the
nsa
or
the
president
if
they
stated
there
were
no
trap
doorsid
be
even
happier
if
a
committee
of
independent
experts
examined
the
thing
under
seal
of
secrecy
and
reported
back
that
it
was
secure
i
wouldnt
trust
the
nsa
i
think
i
would
trust
the
president
on
this
but
im
not
certain
he
would
be
told
id
trust
something
from
the
nsa
long
before
id
trust
something
from
some
swiss
or
anybody
japanese
thats
your
problem
this
may
seem
surprising
to
some
here
but
i
suggest
most
corporations
would
feel
the
same
way
mostmanysome
pick
one
corporations
have
an
attitude
that
the
nsa
is
part
of
our
government
and
we
support
our
government
as
one
very
famous
ceo
put
it
to
me
one
day
i
want
to
emphasize
the
i
am
not
speaking
for
beckman
instruments
at
this
point
however
we
are
an
international
company
and
i
would
like
to
think
that
our

come
first
ahead
of
our
governments
