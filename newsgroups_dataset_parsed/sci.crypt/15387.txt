lets
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
system
really
is
secure
unless
you
get
both
halves
of
the
encryption
key
from
the
two
independent
escrow
houses
lets
say
you
even
trust
the
escrow
houses
one
is
the
aclu
and
the
other
is
the
eff
and
im
not
entirely
joking
about
those
two
names
hi
im
new
to
internet
so
this
is
a
bit
of
a
test
message
so
even
a
token
reply
would
be
very
appreciated
anyways
reading
this
id
figure
this
would
be
as
excellent
a
method
of
corrupting
the
aclu
and
the
eff
as
could
be
wished
for
who
gaurds
the
guardians
etc
