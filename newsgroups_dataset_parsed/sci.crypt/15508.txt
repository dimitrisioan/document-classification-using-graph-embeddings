nobody
seems
to
have
noticed
that
the
clipper
chip
must
have
been
under
development
for
considerably
longer
than
the
months
that
clinton
has
been
president
this
is
not
something
that
choosing
choosing
bush
over
clinton
would
have
changed
in
the
slightest
it
has
been
in
the
works
for
some
time
actually
many
of
us
have
noted
this
we
have
noted
that
the
program
started
at
least
years
ago
that
the
contracts
with
vlsi
technology
and
microtoxin
were
let
at
least
months
ago
that
production
of
the
chips
is
well
underway
and
so
forth
nobody
i
know
has
claimed
clinton
intitiated
the
program
but
he
chose
to
go
ahead
with
it
