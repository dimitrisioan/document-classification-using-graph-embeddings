DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WRITES
HERES
A
SIMPLE
WAY
TO
CONVERT
THE
CLIPPER
PROPOSAL
TO
AN
UNEXCEPTIONABLE
ONE
MAKE
IT
VOLUNTARY
THAT
ISYOU
GET
HIGH
QUALITY
SECURE
NSA
CLASSIFIED
TECHNOLOGY
IF
YOU
AGREE
TO
ESCROW
YOUR
KEY
OTHERWISE
YOU
ARE
ON
YOUR
OWN
DAVID
AS
AN
ECONOMIST
IM
SURE
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
FLAWS
IN
THIS
LOGIC
IF
THE
NAIVE
MARKET
IS
FLOODED
WITH
PROPRIETARY
BUT
WEAK
ENCRYPTION
THEN
TRULY
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
WILL
BE
UNABLE
TO
COMPETE
SUPPOSE
THE
GOVT
HAD
A
SECRET
TV
BROADCAST
STANDARD
AND
THEN
SOLD
TVS
BELOW
COST
PRIVATE
INDUSTRY
HAS
A
BETTER
STANDARD
BUT
ITS
NOT
AS
WIDESPREAD
DUE
TO
THE
GOVT
EARLY
FLOODING
OF
THE
MARKET
WITH
CHEAP
PROPRIETARY
SETS
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
INDUSTRYS
TECHNOLOGY
IS
BETTER
THE
PROGRAMMING
IS
BEING
BROADCAST
TO
THE
GOVTS
UNDUPLICATABLE
STANDARD
WHO
COULD
COMPETE
THE
OTHER
FLAW
OF
COURSE
IS
THAT
MAKING
SOMETHING
VOLUNTARY
TODAY
ENSURES
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
VOLUNTARY
IN
THE
FUTURE
I
WENT
TO
RENEW
MY
CA
DRIVERS
LICENSE
LAST
WEEK
AND
WAS
REQUIRED
NOT
ONLY
TO
GIVE
MY
SSN
BUT
TO
PRODUCE
AN
SSN
CARD
TO
VERYIFY
THE
NUMBER
NOTE
THAT
A
FEDERAL
LAW
ONCE
SAID
THAT
NO
STATE
OR
LOCAL
GOVT
COULD
EVER
REQUIRE
THE
USE
OF
SSNS
FOR
DRIVERS
LICENSE
REGISTRATION
SPECIFICALLY
I
DO
NOT
TRUST
THE
GOVT
THAT
SAYS
TRUST
ME
ON
THIS
EVEN
THOUGH
WE
COULD
HAVE
AN
ARRANGEMENT
THAT
DOESNT
REQUIRE
YOUR
TRUST
SOMETHING
IS
BIG
TIME
FISHY
IF
YOU
LOOK
MORE
CAREFULLY
