THE
SYSTEM
OR
FAMILY
KEY
WOULD
APPEAR
TO
BE
CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY
USELESS
SINCE
EVERY
CHIP
MUST
KNOW
IT
AND
BE
ABLE
TO
REMOVE
ITS
EFFECTS
FROM
THE
BITSTREAM
I
DARESAY
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
WIDELY
KNOWN
ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THIS
SYSTEM
IS
DEPLOYED
AND
SINCE
ITS
BEEN
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THERE
IS
NOT
A
SEPARATE
DECRYPT
KEY
THE
SAME
KEY
IS
USED
FOR
BOTH
ENCRYPTION
AND
DECRYPTION
THERE
GOES
ANY
BENEFIT

THE

I
RECOGNIZE
THAT
A
CLASS
OF
CRIMINALS
AND
JUVENILE
DELINQUENTS
HAS
TAKEN
TO
CALLING
THEMSELVES
HACKERS
BUT
I
CONSIDER
THEM
IRRELEVANT
TO
THE
TRUE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORD
JUST
AS
THE
MAFIA
CALLS
THEMSELVES
BUSINESSMEN
BUT
NOBODY
PAYS
THAT
FACT
ANY
ATTENTION
