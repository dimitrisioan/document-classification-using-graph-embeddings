finally
because
there
is
essentially
no
possibility
of
intercepting
in
realtime
the
scrutable
content
of
communications
between
stolen
instruments
there
will
exist
strong
motivation
to
record
and
archive
all
communications
in
the
network
for
expostfacto
scrutiny
once
some
criminal
act
is
discovered
and
the
instruments
involved
have
been
identified
all
is
a
very
big
number
the
att
long
distance
network
has
around
trunks
mbitsec
which
is
on
the
order
of
bitssec
that
doesnt
even
count
the
amount
of
traffic
in
the
local
phone
companies
or
our
longdistance
competitors
its
about
exabytes
tapes
second
which
is
pretty
large
even
for
the
nsa
on
the
other
hand
i
can
easily
see
them
recording
the
traffic
for
interesting
people
such
as
dissidents
suspected
criminals
foreign
telephone
calls
and
anybody
noticed
using
encryption
as
ken
shiriff
speculates
recording
encrypted
traffic
will
probably
be
judged
not
to
be
an
invasion
of
privacy
pretty
soon
pray
for
peace
