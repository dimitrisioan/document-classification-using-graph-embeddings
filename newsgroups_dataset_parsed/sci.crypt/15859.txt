qualcomm
had
spare
cycles
in
the
dsps
for
their
new
cdma
digital
cellular
phones
they
wanted
to
put
strong
crypto
into
them
since
they
had
the
capacity
the
government
decided
to
discourage
them
youre
blowing
smoke
qualcomm
wants
to
sell
to
nice
lucrative
overseas
markets
like
japan
and
the
ec
the
government
told
them
dont
do
encryption
if
you
ever
hope
to
export
this
technology
the
reason
that
cdma
doesnt
have
encryption
is
not
because
the
gmen
came
aknocking
at
qualcomms
door
its
because
qualcomm
doesnt
think
that
the
us
market
for
digital
cellular
is
big
enough
for
them
this
is
just
the
international
traffic
in
arms
regulations
all
over
again
perry
has
already
stated
on
the
net
that
qualcomm
wanted
to
sell
overseas
and
the
government
told
them
they
wouldnt
be
allowed
to
export
so
hes
only
blowing
the
same
smoke
you
are
sure
they
probably
could
have
made
a
us
version
and
a
noncrypto
export
version
and
contracted
with
a
bulgarian
or
japanese
software
house
to
develop
an
overseas
crypto
rom
but
thats
getting
pretty
expensive
no
cylink
sells
their
phones
because
theyre
willing
to
make
different
stuff
for
domestic
use
vs
export
qualcomm
isnt
so
cylink
makes
moneythats
capitalism
comrade
well
some
people
like
capitalism
and
others
prefer
free
enterprise
theyre
different
using
the
government
to
stifle
your
competition
is
capitalist
someone
out
there
will
build
a
unit
to
do
all
this
better
yet
prehaps
someone
will
produce
a
package
that
turns
any
box
with
a
sound
card
into
a
secure
phone
someone
this
and
someone
that
if
you
think
its
so
easy
why
are
you
whining
on
the
net
instead
of
getting
your
butt
in
gear
and
writing
it
writing
good
crypto
code
is
something
most
good
programmers
can
do
writing
good
new
crypto
algorithms
is
a
very
specialized
skill
developing
new
voice
coding
algorithms
is
also
pretty
specialized
but
finding
ways
to
implement
the
more
complex
ones
when
you
dont
have
enough
horsepower
is
still
fairly
hairy
stuff
once
the
becomes
widespread
or
the
next
generation
of
sound
boards
has
dsps
on
it
i
suspect
well
see
it
happen
maybe
the
vanilla
is
enough
