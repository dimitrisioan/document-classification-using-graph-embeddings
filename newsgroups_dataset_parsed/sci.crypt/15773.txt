I
THINK
THAT
MOST
OF
US
CAN
AFFORD
A
STAMP

AN
ENVELOPE

THE
COST
OF
PRINTING
OUT
A
LETTER
IF
SOME
KIND
SOUL
OUT
THERE
WOULD
WRITE
A
LETTER
AND
UPLOAD
IT
TO
THE
NET
EVERYONE
COULD
CAPTURE
IT
PRINT
IT
OUT
AND
SNAILMAIL
IT
OUT
TO
THEIR
LOCAL
CONGRESSIONAL
CRITTER

IM
WORKING
ON
ONE
FAR
MORE
EFFECTIVE

MASS
MAILING
OF
A
STANDARD
LETTER

IS
TAKEN
USUALLY
TO
REPRESENT
ONE

LIKE
TO

COULD
COMPOSE
THEIR
