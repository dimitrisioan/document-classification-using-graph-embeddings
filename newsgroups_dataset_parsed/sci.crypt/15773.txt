i
think
that
most
of
us
can
afford
a
stamp
and
an
envelope
and
the
cost
of
printing
out
a
letter
if
some
kind
soul
out
there
would
write
a
letter
and
upload
it
to
the
net
everyone
could
capture
it
print
it
out
and
snailmail
it
out
to
their
local
congressional
critter
btw
im
working
on
one
far
more
effective
than
mass
mailing
of
a
standard
letter
this
is
taken
usually
to
represent
one
pressure
group
is
a
set
of
individual
letters
perhaps
nathaniel
sammons
or
someone
else
would
like
to
prepare
a
set
of
talking
points
from
which
individuals
could
compose
their
own
letters
