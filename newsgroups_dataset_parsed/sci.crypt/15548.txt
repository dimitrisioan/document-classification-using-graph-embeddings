BUTZER
WRITES
FINALLY
CAN
ANYONE
EVEN
CONCIEVE
OF
A
TIMEPLACE
WHERE
BIT
KEYS
ARENT
SUFFICIENT
I
CERTAINLY
CANT
EVEN
AT
A
TRILLION
KEYS
A
SECOND
IT
WOULD
TAKE
ABOUT
BILLION
YEARS
TO
SEARCH
JUST
ONE
BILLIONTH
OF
THAT
KEYS
SPACE
IT
DEPENDS
ON
THE
ATTACK
ADDING
A
BIT
TO
THE
KEY
DOUBLES
THE
AMOUNT
OF
WORK
TO
BE
DONE
IN
A
STRAIGHT
BRUTEFORCE
ATTACK
WHERE
YOU
TRY
EVERY
SINGLE
POSSIBLE
KEY
UNTIL
ONE
WORKS
PROCESSING
AND
STORAGE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
THIS
KIND
OF
ATTACK
ON
A
KEY
SEEM
LIKE
THEY
OUGHT
TO
MAKE
IT
EFFECTIVELY
IMPOSSIBLE
HOWEVER
THERE
MAY
BE
OTHER
ATTACKS
WHOSE
DIFFICULTY
IS
FOR
EXAMPLE
PROPORTIONAL
TO
SAY
OR
SOME
SUCH
ALSO
A
LONG
KEY
DOES
YOU
LITTLE
GOOD
IF
THERE
IS
A
WAY
TO
INCREMENTALLY
GUESS
A
LITTLE
OF
THE
KEY
AT
A
TIME
THANKS
