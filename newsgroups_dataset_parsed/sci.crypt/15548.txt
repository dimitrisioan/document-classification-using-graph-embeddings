finally
can
anyone
even
concieve
of
a
timeplace
where
bit
keys
arent
sufficient
i
certainly
cant
even
at
a
trillion
keys
a
second
it
would
take
about
billion
years
to
search
just
one
billionth
of
that
keys
space
it
depends
on
the
attack
adding
a
bit
to
the
key
doubles
the
amount
of
work
to
be
done
in
a
straight
bruteforce
attack
where
you
try
every
single
possible
key
until
one
works
processing
and
storage
requirements
for
this
kind
of
attack
on
a
key
seem
like
they
ought
to
make
it
effectively
impossible
however
there
may
be
other
attacks
whose
difficulty
is
for
example
proportional
to
say
or
some
such
also
a
long
key
does
you
little
good
if
there
is
a
way
to
incrementally
guess
a
little
of
the
key
at
a
time
