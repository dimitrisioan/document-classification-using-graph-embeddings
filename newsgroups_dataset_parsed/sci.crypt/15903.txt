WRITES
YOU
OBVIOUSLY
HAVENT
READ
THE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
SYSTEM
THE
CHIPS
PUT
OUT
SERIAL
NUMBER
INFOMATION
INTO
THE
CYPHER
STREAM
TO
ALLOW
THEMSELVES
TO
BE
IDENTIFIED
THE
SYSTEM
DOES
NOT
RELY
ON
REGISTERING
PEOPLE
AS
OWNING
PARTICULAR
PHONE
UNITS
I
AM
AGAINST
THE
PROPOSAL
BUT
LETS
BE
ACCURATE
IN
OUR
OBJECTIONS
DO
NOT
PRESUME
TO
TELL
ME
WHAT
I
HAVE
AND
HAVE
NOT
READ
THE
SYSTEM
MAY
NOT
RELY
UPON
REGISTERING
PEOPLE
AS
OWNING
PARTICULAR
PHONE
UNITS
BUT
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
KNOW
WHICH
PHONE
UNITS
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
USED
FOR
SOME
SUSPECTED
CRIMINAL
COMMUNICATION
BEFORE
YOU
CAN
OBTAIN
THEIR
UNIT
KEYS
FROM
ESCROW
THIS
NECESSITY
RAISES
THE
STAKES
IN
FAVOR
OF
A
CRIMINALS
COERCING
OR
COLLUDING
USE
OF
SOME
OTHER
PERSONS
CLIPPER
PHONE
I
WILL
RESTATE
MY
ASSUMPTIONS
MORE
EXPLICITLY
AND
AMPLIFY
MY
ARGUMENT
THE
ORIGINAL
TITLE
PERHAPS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
LEGAL
AND
ILLEGAL
CIPHER
SYSTEMS
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
BUT
CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
IS
NOT
INACCURATE
AND
IS
MORE
EYECATCHING
IN
THE
CURRENT
CONTEXT
ASSUMPTIONS
CLIPPER
IS
MADE
AVAILABLE
LAWS
ARE
PASSED
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
CIPHER
SYSTEMS
OTHER
THAN
CLIPPER
ILLEGAL
EITHER
ON
RADIO
SYSTEMS
OR
ON
ANY
COMMON
CARRIER
SYSTEM
THESE
LAWS
ALSO
INCLUDE
ENFORCEMENT
AUTHORITY
TO
LISTEN
ACROSS
THE
RELEVANT
RADIO
SPECTRUM
OR
OTHER
MEDIUM
CHARACTERIZE
SIGNALS
VALIDATE
CLIPPER
WRAPPERS
DETECT
PROBABLE
USE
OF
NONCLIPPER
CIPHERS
AND
MAKE
SUCH
DETECTION
A
CAUSE
FOR
FURTHER
ACTION
FOR
ESCROWED
KEYS
TO
BE
USEFUL
SOME
SPECIFIC
CLIPPER
CHIP
MUST
BE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
SUSPECTED
CRIMINAL
THIS
MEANS
THAT
AT
A
MINIMUM
SOME
ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN
THE
COMMON
CARRIERS
UNIQUE
PHONE
ID
ESN
AND
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
SERIAL
NUMBER
N
WILL
BE
STORED
IN
A
GOVERNMENT
DATABASE
AN
OBSERVED
PAIRING
OF
N
AND
ESN
OTHER
THAN
THE
ONE
RECORDED
RAISES
A
RED
FLAG
TO
REDUCE
ORDINARY
FRAUD
THE
CELLPHONE
SYSTEM
WHICH
OFFERS
CLIPPER
WILL
ALSO
BE
CONSTRUCTED
WITH
AN
ESN
MECHANISM
MUCH
MORE
TAMPERPROOF
AND
MUCH
LESS
SPOOFABLE
THAN
TODAYS
CELLPHONES
CRIMINALS
WANT
INSCRUTABLE
COMMUNICATIONS
SOME
CRIMINALS
ARE
NOT
ENTIRELY
STUPID
OR
IGNORANT
AND
WILL
FIGURE
OUT
BOTH
THAT
CLIPPER
CELLPHONES
OFFER
EXCELLENT
SECURITY
IN
NORMAL
CIRCUMSTANCES
AND
THAT
THEY
OFFER
NO
SECURITY
AGAINST
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
ONCE
A
PRESUMABLY
LEGITIMATE
WIRETAP
ORDER
EXISTS
THEY
WILL
ALSO
FIGURE
OUT
THAT
THE
WIRETAP
ORDER
MUST
NECESSARILY
BE
AGAINST
A
SPECIFIC
CELLPHONE
BECAUSE
EACH
ONE
HAS
A
UNIQUE
UNIT
KEY
CRIMINALS
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
CALL
ATTENTION
TO
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
STUPID
OR
IGNORANT
OR
BECAUSE
THEY
READ
NETNEWS
AND
BECAUSE
THEY
KNOW
THAT
THEIR
OPEN
USE
OF
A
NONCLIPPER
CIPHER
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
DETECTED
THEY
WILL
GENERALLY
AVOID
USING
NONCLIPPER
CIPHERS
DIRECTLY
ON
SOME
MONITORABLETAPPABLE
CHANNEL
THEY
KNOW
THAT
DO
SO
WOULD
RAISE
A
RED
FLAG
PUTTING
A
GIVEN
CELLPHONE
IF
NOT
A
GIVEN
PERSON
UNDER
IMMEDIATE
SUSPICION
IT
IS
IMPRACTICAL
TO
REVERSE
ENGINEER
SKIPJACK
DISCOVER
FAMILY
KEY
F
AND
CONSTRUCT
A
FUNCTIONAL
CLONE
OF
A
CLIPPER
CHIP
BY
AND
IT
WILL
BE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
SPOOF
A
GIVEN
CLIPPER
PHONE
WITHOUT
IMMEDIATE
DETECTION
BECAUSE
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
OBSCURE
ONES
ASSOCIATION
TO
A
SPECIFIC
PHONE
BY
REPROGRAMMING
OR
CHANGING
CHIPS
AROUND
THE
CRIMINAL
WILL
BE
MOTIVATED
TO
FIND
AN
INTACT
PHONE
WHICH
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
SOMEONE
ELSE
A
NONSTUPID
CRIMINAL
WILL
CONCLUDE
THAT
THEY
CAN
HAVE
CLIPPERSECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
AT
LEAST
FOR
SOME
LIMITED
TIME
T
IF
THEY
BUY
BEG
BORROW
OR
STEAL
USE
OF
SOMEONES
PHONE
IN
A
WAY
THAT
PREVENTS
THAT
PERSON
FROM
REPORTING
COMPROMISE
OF
THE
PHONE
FOR
AT
LEAST
TIME
T
THE
ENCRYPTED
COMMUNICATIONS
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
RECORDED
AND
THUS
BE
RETRIEVABLE
LATER
BUT
THE
CRIMINAL
CAN
DELAY
AND
QUITE
LIKELY
EVADE
DISCOVERY
BY
DESTROYING
OR
ABANDONING
THE
PHONE
BEFORE
T
ELAPSES
IT
WOULD
BE
UNUSUAL
FOR
AN
INNOCENT
PERSON
TO
VOLUNTEER
USE
OF
THEIR
CLIPPER
PHONE
TO
SOMEONE
ELSE
THE
HONEST
SUBSCRIBER
DOESNT
WANT
TO
PAY
SOMEONE
ELSES
BILL
AND
HE
DOESNT
WANT
TO
FALL
UNDER
SUSPICION
THIS
LEAVES
TWO
SOURCES
OF
CLIPPER
PHONES
FOR
CRIMINAL
USE
COERCION
AND
COLLUSION
COERCION
FIRST
THEFT
BEARS
A
RELATIVELY
LOW
RISK
BUT
ALSO
SOMETIMES
A
LOW
TIME
UNTIL
DETECTION
A
FEW
MINUTES
IF
A
PHONE
IS
STOLEN
FROM
A
CAR
PARKED
IN
FRONT
OF
A
STORE
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
IF
A
PHONE
IS
STOLEN
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
AWAY
ON
VACATION
CRIMINAL
COMMERCE
IS
LIKELY
TO
ARISE
IN
STOLEN
CLIPPER
PHONES
WITH
PHONES
COMING
FROM
RISKINURED
POOR
CRIMINALS
AND
CASH
COMING
FROM
RISKAVERSE
WEALTHY
CRIMINALS
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
EXTRAORDINARILY
MOTIVATED
TO
GAIN
A
DAY
OR
TWO
OF
UNDETECTED
COMMUNICATION
LIKE
A
TERRORIST
COULD
KILL
A
PERSON
OR
HOLD
THEM
HOSTAGE
THE
LIMITED
TIME
BEFORE
DETECTION
THAT
A
COERCED
PHONE
IS
USEFUL
MEANS
THAT
CONTINUING
CRIMINAL
ENTERPRISES
REQUIRE
A
CONTINUING
SUPPLY
OF
FRESHLY
COERCED
PHONES
THERE
WOULD
ALSO
BE
CREATED
A
COLLUSIVE
COMMERCE
BETWEEN
RELATIVELY
WEALTHY
CRIMINALS
AND
IGNORANT
OR
DONTCARE
PATSIES
WHO
NEED
MONEY
AND
WHO
WILL
SUBMIT
TO
BEING
PAID
IN
RETURN
FOR
SUBSCRIBING
TO
CLIPPER
PHONE
SERVICE
FOR
SOMEONE
ELSES
USE
CRIMINALS
WILL
LEARN
THAT
IT
IS
MORE
TO
THEIR
ADVANTAGE
TO
COERCE
USE
OF
A
CLIPPER
CELLPHONE
THAN
IT
IS
TO
APPLY
A
NONCLIPPER
CIPHER
TO
A
NORMAL
CELLPHONE
THEY
WILL
CALL
MUCH
LESS
ATTENTION
TO
THEMSELVES
OR
AT
LEAST
TO
THEIR
STOLEN
PHONE
THIS
WAY
THE
FACT
OF
A
PHONES
USE
BEING
COERCED
MUST
FIRST
BE
REPORTED
BEFORE
IT
CAN
BE
IDENTIFIED
AS
AN
INTERESTING
PHONE
AND
HAVE
ITS
KEYS
OBTAINED
FROM
ESCROW
CLIPPER
ALSO
ALLOWS
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
THE
CRIMINAL
TO
CONCEAL
USE
OF
SUPERENCRYPTION
AN
AUTOMATED
FULLSYSTEM
SURVEILLANCE
MECHANISM
QUITE
FEASIBLE
ACROSS
RADIO
BANDWIDTH
WHICH
KNOWS
FAMILY
KEY
F
CAN
VALIDATE
CLIPPER
WRAPPERS
AND
NESN
ASSOCIATIONS
BUT
IT
CANNOT
REVEAL
IN
REALTIME
THE
USE
OF
SUPERENCRYPTION
UNLESS
IT
KNOWS
ALL
UNIT
KEYS
WHICH
WE
ARE
BEING
ASSURED
ARE
ONLY
TO
BE
MADE
AVAILABLE
IN
TWO
SEPARATE
PIECES
UPON
SPECIFIC
WIRETAPLIKE
ORDER
WHEREAS
A
CRIMINALS
USE
OF
ANY
CIPHER
WITHIN
A
NORMALLY
CLEARTEXT
MEDIUM
WOULD
STAND
OUT
A
CRIMINALS
USE
OF
A
NONCLIPPER
CIPHER
WITHIN
A
CLIPPER
MEDIUM
WOULD
BE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
DETECT
EVEN
EX
POST
FACTO
IN
BULK
RECORDINGS
AS
LONG
AS
THE
ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN
CRIMINAL
AND
SPECIFIC
CLIPPER
CHIP
IS
FRACTURED
IF
YOU
MAKE
USE
OF
THIS
OTHER
CIPHER
ILLEGAL
PER
SE
THEN
YOU
CAN
CHARGE
THE
CRIMINAL
WITH
THIS
IF
YOU
CAN
IDENTIFY
THE
TRUE
CRIMINAL
HELL
BE
USING
SOMEONE
ELSES
PHONE
BUT
YOULL
HAVE
NO
EVIDENCE
TO
HELP
YOU
AGAINST
WHATEVER
TRADITIONAL
CRIME
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
PLANNING
YOU
WILL
NOT
EVEN
BE
ABLE
TO
DETECT
THAT
UNUSUAL
ENCRYPTED
COMMUNICATIONS
ARE
OCCURRING
UNTIL
YOU
IDENTIFY
SPECIFIC
PHONES
AND
OBTAIN
THEIR
KEYS
FROM
ESCROW
THE
GANGSTER
AND
TERRORIST
ARE
THUS
ARGUABLY
MORE
NOT
LESS
SECURE
THAN
THEY
WERE
BEFORE
CLIPPER
CAME
ALONG
I
THEREFORE
CONSIDER
CLIPPER
HARMFUL
BECAUSE
IT
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
ABSOLUTE
PRIVACY
TO
THE
HONEST
PUBLIC
AGAINST
AGGRESSIVE
OR
DISHONEST
GOVERNMENT
IF
OTHER
CIPHERS
ARE
PROSCRIBED
IT
ENGENDERS
NEW
TYPES
OF
DIRECT
CRIMINAL
THREAT
TO
THE
HONEST
PUBLIC
IT
PROVIDES
AN
EXTRAORDINARILY
EFFECTIVE
MECHANISM
FOR
CRIMINALS
TO
HIDE
THEIR
USE
OF
SOME
OTHER
CIPHER
MAKING
IT
MORE
DIFFICULT
THAN
EVER
EVEN
TO
GAIN
NOTICE
THAT
UNUSUAL
COMMUNICATIONS
ARE
OCCURRING
AND
THAT
PLANS
FOR
SOME
CRIMINAL
ACT
MIGHT
BE
IN
PROGRESS
IF
OTHER
CIPHERS
ARE
PROSCRIBED
LAZY
INVESTIGATORS
AND
PROSECUTORS
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
PURSUE
THE
EASILY
QUANTIFIABLE
CIPHERUSE
CRIME
THAN
THEY
ARE
THE
TRADITIONAL
AND
DIRECTLY
HARMFUL
CRIMES
WHICH
KEY
ESCROW
IS
CLAIMED
TO
HELP
AGAINST
IF
OTHER
CIPHERS
ARE
PROSCRIBED
THE
STAGE
IS
SET
FOR
WITCH
HUNTING
OF
ILLEGAL
CIPHER
USE
BECAUSE
ANY
COMPUTER
CAN
BE
USED
AS
A
CIPHER
