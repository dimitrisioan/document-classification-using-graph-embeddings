re
facinating
facts
bit
serial
number
possibly
fixed
and
the
only
way
to
view
this
method
of
generating
unit
keys
is
as
a
backdoor
what
else
can
you
call
a
key
deterministically
generated
from
the
serial
number
to
generate
the
unit
key
for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce
and
and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to
and
the
second
bits
to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit
key
u
is
the
xor
of
and
and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
what
happens
is
that
the
need
for
the
escrow
houses
is
completely
eliminated
or
should
i
say
the
need
to
access
the
escrow
houses
to
decrypt
the
data
the
houses
will
still
serve
a
real
purpose
as
far
as
generating
the
illusion
of
protection
and
smalltown
cops
wont
be
let
in
on
the
secret
so
they
will
still
go
through
the
motions
of
going
to
the
escrow
houses
but
the
fact
is
the
federal
government
can
and
will
build
a
chip
which
generates
the
unit
keys
from
the
encrypted
serial
number
