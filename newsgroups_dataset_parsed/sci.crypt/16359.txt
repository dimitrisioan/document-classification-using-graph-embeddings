YOU

KNOWS

THUS
RECEIVING
THE
FALSE
MESSAGE
WHICH
WAS
SUBSTITUTED
BY
EVE
FIRSTLY
AN
ASIDE
I
AGREE
THAT
THE
WEAKNESS
EXISTS
BUT
I
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
TROUBLE
BELIEVING
THAT
IT
REPRESENTS
A
DIFFICULTY
IN
REAL
LIFE
GIVEN
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
ONETIME
PAD
IS
TO
GIVE
UNBREAKABLE
SECURITY
AND
THE
EXPENSE
OF
KEY
DISTRIBUTION
ETC
IMPLY
THAT
THE
CLIENTS
REALLY
DO
WANT
THAT
LEVEL
OF
SECURITY
THESE
SAME
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
KEEP
P
A
SECRET
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
EVE
MIGHT
HAPPEN
TO
HAVE
A
COPY
OF
P
LYING
AROUND
I
AM
AWARE
THAT
THE
SAME
ARGUMENT
APPLIES
TO
EVE
KNOWING
EVEN
A
SMALL
PART
OF
THE
MESSAGE
BUT
EVE
MUST
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHERE
WHICH
BYTES
IN
C
HER
KNOWN
SUSEQUENCE
STARTS
OR
THE
RESULT
WILL
BE
GARBLED
I
FIND
THIS
AT
LEAST
AS
SURPRISING
BACK
TO
THE
QUESTION
IF
I
HAD
THE
RESOURCES
TO
USE
A
ONETIMEPAD
FOR
SUCH
TRANSMISSIONS
I
WOULD
ALSO
APPEND
A
MESSAGE
AUTHENTICATION
CODE
TO
THE
MESSAGE
USING
UP
THE
NEXT
BITS
OF
THE
ONETIMEPAD
AS
THE
KEY
PERHAPS
YOUR
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
BASICALLY
ASKED
WHETHER
THERE
WAS
ANY
WAY
TO
AUTHENTICATE
THE
MESSAGE
WITH
THE
SAME
DEGREE
OF
SECURITY
AS
THE
PAD
ITSELF
PROVIDED
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
ANSWER
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
PROPOSE
THE
FOLLOWING
FOR
DISCUSSION
ALICE
AND
BOB
HAVE
AN
ARBITRARY
NUMBER
OF
SECRET
RANDOM
BITS
TO
SHARE
WHICH
EVE
DOESNT
KNOW
SHE
FINDS
THEM
OUT
EFFECTIVELY
BY
KNOWING
SOME
P
AND
THE
CORRESPONDING
C
IT
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
CORRESPOND
THAT
CAUSES
THE
PROBLEM
IF
A
MESSAGE
AUTHENTICATION
CODE
WAS
TO
BE
CREATED
USING
SOME
ONETIMEPAD
OPERATION
SUCH
THAT
EVE
COULD
NOT
KNOW
WHICH
PARTS
OF
THE
MAC
WERE
AFFECTED
BY
WHICH
PARTS
OF
THE
INPUT
SHE
WOULD
BE
UNABLE
TO
FORGE
A
MAC
TO
CORRESPOND
WHAT
IS
REQUIRED
IS
A
NONLINEAR
COMBINER
OF
PARTS
OF
THE
MESSAGE
NONLINEAR
SO
THAT
SIMPLY
XORING
OR
SUBTRACTING
OR
WHATEVER
DOESNT
HAVE
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
EFFECT
NOW
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
ENCRYPTED
MESSAGE
C
ALICE
APPENDS
A
NBIT
MAC
COMPUTED
AS
FOLLOWS
MEANS
THE
NEXT
FULL
CHUNK
OF
THE
ONE
TIME
PAD
COMPUTE
P
XOR
AND
PAD
TO
AN
NBIT
BOUNDARY
WITH
MORE

CHUNKS

FOR
I
IN
EACH
CHUNK
SEQUENTIALLY
SET
MAC
MAC
NLOP
AT
THE
END
OF
THIS
PROCESS
MAC
IS
THE
MESSAGE
AUTHENTICATION
CODE
BOB
VERIFIES
THE
MAC
IN
THE
OBVIOUS
MANNER
HE
RECOVERS
THE
PLAINTEXT
P
THEN
USES
SOME
MORE
OF
HIS
PAD
TO
REPRODUCE
THE
MAC
IN
THE
SAME
MANNER
NLOP
IS
THE
NONLINEAR
OPERATOR
AND
THERE
IS
THE
RUB
THE
SIMPLEST
NONLINEAR
OPERATOR
I
CAN
THINK
OF
IS
AN
SBOX
THAT
IS
HAVE
A
FIXED
EVEN
PUBLISHED
PERMUTATION
OF
THE
NBIT
INTEGERS
AN
INDEXABLE
TABLE
CALLED
SBOX
AND
USE
X
NLOP
Y
X
XOR
SBOXY
PRACTICALLY
SPEAKING
I
THINK
THIS
SOLVES
YOUR
PROBLEM
AS
EVE
NEVER
SEES
THE
INTERMEDIATE
OUTPUT
AND
HENCE
CANT
DEDUCE
OR
PERFORM
ANY
VALID
SUBSTITUTION
ON
IT
ALSO
PRACTICALLY
SPEAKING
YOU
WANT
THE
MAC
TO
BE
FAIRLY
LARGE
SAY
BITS
BUT
YOU
MIGHT
NOT
WANT
A
GIGABYTE
SAY
SBOX
SO
YOU
MIGHT
WORK
ON
BYTESIZED
SBOXES
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
IS
AN
IRRELEVANT
DETAIL
FOR
THE
DISCUSSION
AT
HAND
WHO
WILL
BE
FIRST
TO
POINT
OUT

ERRORS
