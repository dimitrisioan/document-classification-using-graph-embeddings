let
me
ask
you
this
would
you
trust
richard
nixon
with
your
crypto
keys
i
wouldnt
i
take
it
you
mean
president
nixon
not
private
citizen
nixon
sure
nothing
im
doing
would
be
of
the
slightest
interest
to
president
nixon
are
you
sure
you
arent
being
watched
let
me
remind
you
that
watergate
was
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
nixon
extensively
used
the
nsa
to
watch
people
because
he
didnt
like
them
according
to
decrypting
the
puzzle
palace
presumably
the
nsa
is
restricted
from
conducting
american
surveillance
by
both
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
act
of
and
a
series
of
presidential
directives
beginning
with
one
issued
by
president
ford
following
richard
nixons
bold
misuse
of
the
nsa
in
which
he
explicitly
directed
the
nsa
to
conduct
widespread
domestic
surveillance
of
political
dissidents
and
drug
users
of
course
just
because
there
are
laws
saying
the
govt
is
not
supposed
to
conduct
illegal
surveillance
doesnt
mean
those
laws
cant
be
broken
when
they
are
in
the
way
