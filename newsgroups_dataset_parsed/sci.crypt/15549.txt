the
bush
administration
and
the
career
gestapo
were
responsible
for
this
horror
and
the
careerists
presented
it
to
the
new
presidency
as
a
fait
accompli
that
doesnt
excuse
clinton
and
gore
from
criticism
for
being
so
stupid
as
to
go
for
it
but
lets
lay
the
body
at
the
proper
door
to
start
with
the
final
stages
of
denial
i
can
hardly
imagine
what
the
result
would
have
been
if
the
clinton
administration
had
actually
supported
this
plan
instead
of
merely
acquiescing
with
repugnance
as
theyve
so
obviously
doing
i
dont
believe
the
chip
originated
with
the
clinton
administration
either
but
the
clinton
administration
has
embraced
it
and
brought
it
to
fruition
the
date
i
have
for
this
is
note
clintons
statements
about
encryption
in
the
paragraph
i
guess
this
statement
doesent
contradict
what
you
said
though
cut
here
washington
upi
the
war
on
drugs
is
about
to
get
a
fresh
start
president
clinton
told
delegates
to
the
national
federation
of
police
commisioners
convention
in
washington
in
the
first
speech
on
the
drug
issue
since
his
innaugural
clinton
said
that
his
planned
escalation
of
the
drug
war
would
make
everything
so
far
seem
so
halfhearted
that
for
all
practical
purposes
this
war
is
only
beginning
now
he
repeatedly
emphasized
his
view
that
regardless
of
what
has
been
tried
or
who
has
tried
it
or
how
long
theyve
been
trying
it
this
is
day
one
to
me
the
audience
at
the
convention
whose
theme
is
how
do
we
spell
fiscal
relief
forfeiture
interrupted
clinton
frequently
with
applause
clintons
program
presented
in
the
speech
follows
the
outline
given
in
his
campaign
position
papers
a
cabinetlevel
drug
czar
and
boot
camps
for
firsttime
youthful
offenders
he
did
however
cover
in
more
detail
his
plans
for
improved
enforcement
methods
this
years
crime
bill
will
have
teeth
not
bare
gums
clinton
said
in
particular
his
administration
will
place
strict
controls
on
data
formats
and
protocols
and
require
the
registration
of
socalled
cryptographic
keys
in
the
hope
of
denying
drug
dealers
the
ability
to
communicate
in
secret
clinton
said
the
approach
could
be
used
for
crackdowns
on
other
forms
of
underground
economic
activity
such
as
the
deficitcausing
tax
evaders
who
live
in
luxury
at
the
expense
of
our
grandchildren
clinton
expressed
optimism
that
the
drug
war
can
be
won
because
even
though
not
everyone
voted
for
bill
clinton
last
november
everyone
did
vote
for
a
candidate
who
shares
my
sense
of
urgency
about
fighting
the
drug
menace
the
advocates
of
legalization
the
advocates
of
surrender
may
be
very
good
at
making
noise
clinton
said
but
when
the
american
people
cast
their
ballots
it
only
proved
what
i
knew
all
along
that
the
advocates
of
surrender
are
nothing
more
than
a
microscopic
fringe
