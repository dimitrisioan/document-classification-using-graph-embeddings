THE
BUSH
ADMINISTRATION
AND
THE
CAREER
GESTAPO
WERE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THIS
HORROR
AND
THE
CAREERISTS
PRESENTED
IT
TO
THE
NEW
PRESIDENCY
AS
A
FAIT
ACCOMPLI
THAT
DOESNT
EXCUSE
CLINTON
AND
GORE
FROM
CRITICISM
FOR
BEING
SO
STUPID
AS
TO
GO
FOR
IT
BUT
LETS
LAY
THE
BODY
AT
THE
PROPER
DOOR
TO
START
WITH
THE
FINAL
STAGES
OF

I
CAN
HARDLY
IMAGINE
WHAT
THE
RESULT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
IF
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
HAD
ACTUALLY
SUPPORTED
THIS
PLAN
INSTEAD
OF
MERELY
ACQUIESCING
WITH

AS
THEYVE
SO
OBVIOUSLY
DOING
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THE

ORIGINATED
WITH
THE

EITHER

THE

HAS
EMBRACED
IT

CONVENTION
IN

IN

SPEECH
ON
THE
DRUG
ISSUE
SINCE
HIS
INNAUGURAL
CLINTON
SAID
THAT
HIS
PLANNED
ESCALATION
OF
THE

WAR
WOULD
MAKE
EVERYTHING
SO
FAR
SEEM
SO
HALFHEARTED
THAT
FOR
ALL
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
THIS
WAR
IS
ONLY

HE
REPEATEDLY
EMPHASIZED
HIS

HIS

THE
ADVOCATES

THE
ADVOCATES
OF
SURRENDER
MAY
BE
VERY
GOOD
AT

WHEN
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
CAST
THEIR
BALLOTS
IT
ONLY
PROVED
WHAT
I
KNEW
ALL
ALONG
THAT
THE
ADVOCATES
OF
SURRENDER
ARE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
MICROSCOPIC
FRINGE
