CAN

DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WRITES
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
TO
SEND
ANY
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
CODE
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
WITHOUT
AN
EXPORT
LICENSE
OTHERS
WILL
CORRECT
ME
IF
THIS
IS
INACCURATE
GLAD
TO
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
TO
SEND
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
CODE
AND
LOTS
OF
OTHER
THINGS
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
WITHOUT
A
LICENSE
HOWEVER
EVERY
US
CITIZEN
HAS
A
GENERAL
EXPORT
LICENSE
ALLOWING
EXPORT
OF
LOTS
OF
THINGS
INCLUDING
CONSTITUTIONALLY
PROTECTED
SPEECH
THIS
HAS
THE
EFFECT
THAT
IT
IS
LEGAL
FOR
US
CITIZENS
TO
EXPORT
SOME
THINGS
WHICH
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
FOR
A
US
CORPORATION
TO
EXPORT
WITHOUT
FIRST
OBTAINING
A
LICENSE
DUNNO
IF
YOUD
GET
ONE
FOR
THE
PARTICULAR
CODE
YOU
HAVE
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
FIND
OUT
IS
TO
APPLY
FOR
A
LICENSE
NOPE
TALK
TO
A
GOOD
LAWYER
IN
THE
AREA
OF
EXPORT
LAW
BUT
IN
GENERAL
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
TO
HAVE
A
VERY
GOOD
NATIONAL
SECURITY
CASE
TO
TRY
PREVENT
THE
EXPORT
OF
ANYTHING
YOU
PERSONALLY
MIGHT
WISH
TO
PUBLISH
YES
I
WORDED
THAT
THE
WAY
I
DID
INTENTIONALLY
IT
IS
A
LOT
EASIER
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
TRY
TO
PREVENT
THE
EXPORT
OF
INFORMATION
THAN
TO
CHARGE
SOMEONE
WITH
A
CRIME
AFTER
THE
FACT
ESPIONAGE
IS
PROBABLY
THE
ONLY
EXCEPTION
NOTE
THAT
YOU
NEED
TO
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
WHAT
IS
LEGAL
TO
SEND
TO
CANADA
IF
YOU
HAVE
SUCH
A
LICENSE
AND
WHAT
IS
LEGAL
TO
SEND
IF
YOU
DONT
IF
YOU
ARE
A
US
CITIZEN
YOU
HAVE
A
GENERAL
LICENSE
I
AM
NOT
A
LAWYER
SO
TAKE
SOME
OF
THIS
WITH
A
GRAIN
OF
SALT
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
ALSO
HAD
TO
SWIM
THROUGH
BOTH
ITAR
AND
EXPORT
REGS
IN
A
FEW
CASES
