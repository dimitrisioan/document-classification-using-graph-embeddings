initial
eff
analysis
of
clinton
privacy
and
security
proposal
details
of
the
proposal
escrow
the
key
will
be
divided
between
two
escrow
agents
each
of
whom
hold
of
each
key
the
manufacturer
of
the
communications
device
would
be
required
to
register
all
keys
with
the
two
independent
escrow
agents
a
key
is
tied
to
the
device
however
not
the
person
using
it
so
if
we
subvert
one
of
the
two
escrow
agents
we
only
have
a
space
to
search
through
doesnt
sound
that
big
is
digital
telephony
subject
to
a
known
plaintext
attack
in
which
case
half
the
key
seems
to
be
all
that
is
needed
and
the
two
agent
escrow
arrangement
is
pointless
of
course
the
unknown
algorithm
might
turn
gaps
in
speech
into
pseudorandom
sequences
or
there
might
be
some
magic
involved
