i
also
believe
that
someone
will
reverse
engineer
the
clipper
chip
and
knowlege
of
the
algorithm
will
likely
be
fairly
widespread
the
chip
and
algorithm
are
classified
if
you
reverse
engineer
it
and
tell
people
you
are
likely
to
go
to
jail
well
im
not
a
lawyer
but
from
what
i
can
tell
this
is
completely
and
utterly
untrue
you
see
this
country
has
this
thing
called
a
constitution
if
you
legitimately
aquire
the
device
and
you
yourself
are
not
a
government
employee
or
otherwise
encumbered
i
dont
think
they
can
stop
you
from
revealing
anything
about
the
device
you
can
determine
remember
the
pentagon
papers
precedent
the
first
amendment
applies
here
the
us
does
not
have
an
official
secrets
act
we
do
have
laws
that
will
punish
you
for
revealing
what
classified
information
you
learned
in
your
capacity
as
a
government
official
contractor
etc
and
we
have
laws
that
prohibit
stealing
such
information
however
if
they
sell
you
the
chip
i
cant
see
that
they
can
make
reverse
engineering
it
and
revealing
the
details
illegal
