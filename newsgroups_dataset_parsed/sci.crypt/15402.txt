DAVID

WRITES

A
VERY
INTERESTING
MESSAGE
IN
WHICH
HE
COMMENTS
ON
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
ON
STATE
AND
LOCAL
POLICE
ACTUALLY
READING
BETWEEN
THE
LINES
IT
COULD
BE
A
VERY
GOOD
THING
FOR
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
IN
ONE
RESPECT
SINCE
IT
WILL
AT
LEAST
PREVENT
COWBOY
COPS
AND
COWBOY
STATE
AND
LOCAL
AGANCIES
FROM
READING
YOUR
TRAFFIC
IF
THEY
TAP
IT
ILLEGALLY
INSTEAD
OF
READING
BETWEEN
THE
LINES
TRY
TO
THINK
A
LITTLE
BIT
OK
IF
THATS
WAY
TOO
DIFFICULT
TO
YOU
HERE
ARE
SOME
HINTS
INDEED
THE
NEW
PROPOSAL
IMPOSES
SOME
ADDITIONAL
BUROCRATIC
BURDEN
ON
THE
LOCAL
POLICE
IF
THEY
BADLY
WANT
TO
TAPE
THE
MAGIC
COOKIE
RECIPIE
THAT
YOUR
MOM
IS
TELLING
YOU
ON
THE
PHONE
SO
GUESS
WHAT
THEY
WILL
DO
PROPOSE
THAT
THE
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
IS
REMOVED
OR
IMPLEMENT
SOME
FACILITATIONS
OF
COURSE
YOU
WONT
WANT
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
THEY
GET
THE
APPROVAL
FROM
TWO
DIFFERENT
AGENCIES
TO
DECRYPT
THE
CONVERSATION
BETWEEN
TWO
CHILD
MOLESTERS
BECAUSE
MEANWHILE
THOSE
TWO
CHILD
MOLESTERS
MIGHT
BE
CONSPIRING
ABOUT
MOLESTING
YOUR
CHILD
RIGHT
SO
THERE
SHOULD
BE
SOME
WAY
FOR
THEM
TO
GET
ACCESS
TO
THOSE
KEYS
QUICKLY
RIGHT
LIKE
THEY
COULD
HAVE
A
COPY
OF
THE
DATABASE
AND
WORRY
ABOUT
A
WARRANT
