IF
THE
CLINTON
CLIPPER
IS
SO
VERY
GOOD
WHY
NOT
MAKE
ITS
ALGRITHM
PUBLIC
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
CAN
EXCHANGE
IDEAS
AND
EXAMINE
IT
RATHER
THAN
A
FEW
ISOLATED
RESPECTED
EXPERTS
RESPECTED
BY
WHOM
FOR
WHAT
PERHAPS
A
ONE
MORE
TIME
IF
THEY
RELEASED
THE
ALGORITHM
IT
WOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
FOR
SOMEONE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
AN
IMPLEMENTATION
WHICH
WAS
IDENTICAL
BUT
LACKING
AN
ESCROWED
KEY
NOTE
THAT
THE
PRESS
ANNOUNCEMENT
MENTIONED
THAT
THE
ALGORITHM
WAS
BEING
KEPT
SECRET
FOR
SECURITY
OF
THE
KEY
ESCROW
SYSTEM
IN
THIS
CASE
SECURITY
MEANS
AN
ESCROWED
KEY
FOR
EVERY
CLIPPER
CHIP
ASSUMING
YOU
BELIEVED
ALL
THAT
IS
SAID
ABOUT
THE
EFFECTIVE
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
AND
THE
ESCROW
SYSTEM
WHICH
WOULD
YOU
BUY
A
CHIP
FROM
FIRM
A
WITH
THE
ESCROWED
KEY
B
SECOND
SOURCE
CHIP
FROM
REPUTABLE
FIRM
B
WITH
NO
KEY
IN
GOVERNMENT
ESCROW
THERE
WOULD
OBVIOUSLY
BE
POWERFUL
ECONOMIC
INCENTIVES
FOR
A
SECOND
SOURCE
NON
ESCROWED
VENDOR
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
SECOND
SOURCES
FOR
PINCOMPATIBLE
NONCLIPPER
ALGORITHM
CHIPS
THAT
ALSO
HAVE
ESCROWED
KEYS
IF
A
REPUTABLE
FIRM
PRODUCES
A
CHIP
WITH
ESCROWED
KEY
THAT
IS
A
POPIN
REPLACEMENT
FOR
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
MY
PHONE
AND
USES
AN
ALGORITHM
THAT
IS
WIDELY
KNOWN
AND
EVALUATED
AND
TRUSTED
THEN
WHATS
THE
PROBLEM
THE
CLIPPER
IS
GOING
TO
BE
REVERSE
ENGINEERED
ANYWAY
BY
ANY
ORGANIZATION
WITH
SUFFICIENT
RESOURCES
CAN
YOU

IS

WHATNOT
SO
THE

COULD
