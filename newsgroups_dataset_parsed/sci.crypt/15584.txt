STEVE
SIMMONS
WRITES
NORMALLY
ID
BE
THE
LAST
TO
ARGUE
WITH
STEVE
BUT
SHOULDNT
THAT
READ
YEARS
FOR
ALL
SOLUTIONS
I
MEAN
IF
WE
CAN
IMAGINE
THE
MACHINE
THAT
DOES
TRIALNANOSECOND
WE
CAN
IMAGINE
THE
STORAGE
MEDIUM
THAT
COULD
INDEX
AND
ARCHIVE
IT
HMMMM
I
THINK
WITH
REALLY
LARGE
KEYSPACES
LIKE
THIS
YOU
NEED
TO
ALTER
THE
STRATEGY
DISCUSSED
FOR
DES
ATTEMPT
DECRYPTION
OF
SEVERAL
BLOCKS
AND
CHECK
THE
DISCTRIBUTION
OF
THE
CONTENTS
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
AT
ALL
FEASIBLE
TO
KEEP
ENCRYPTIONS
OF
A
KNOWN
PLAINTEXT
BLOCK
ON
ANY
AMOUNT
OF
TAPE
OR
CDROM
AND
CERTAINLY
NOT
SUCH
ENCRYPTED
BLOCKS
ANYONE
KNOW
A
CHEAP
WAY
OF
CONVERTING
EVERY
ATOM
IN
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
INTO
A
ONE
BIT
STORAGE
DEVICE
I
DONT
CLAIM
TO
BE
A
CRYPTO
ANALYIST
THERE
ISNT
A
WHOLE
LOT
OF
GOOD
LITERATURE
ON
THE
SUBJECT
AND
THE
BEST
PEOPLE
DONT
SEEM
TO
PUBLISH
THEIR
WORK
BUT
I
RATHER
DOUBT
THE
APPROACH
SUCH
FOLKS
USE
IS
BRUTE
FORCE
SORRY
TO
HAVE
IMPLIED
THAT
IN
MY
PREVIOUS
POST
THE
HISTORY
OF
THESE
THINGS
IS
FOLKS
FIND
CLEVER
WAYS
OF
LIMITING
THE
SEARCH
AND
BANG
FROM
THERE
I
GUESS
MY
REAL
PROBLEM
WITH
SKIPJACK
IS
I
CAN
NOT
BELIEVE
NSA
WOULD
MAKE
PUBLICLY
AVAILABLE
A
SYSTEM
THEY
COULDNT
BREAK
IF
THEY
WANTED
IT
JUST
ISNT
IN
THEIR
CHARTER
REMEMBER
DES
CAME
FROM
IBM
NOT
NSA
AND
WHEN
FIRST
PUBLISHED
WAS
GIVEN
A
USEFUL
LIFE
OF
YEARS
I
THINK
WE
ARE
WELL
PAST
THAT
POINT
NOW
REMEMBER
BASED
ON
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
NSA
BUDGET
THEY
SPEND
A
LOT
MORE
ON
THE
TECHNOLOGY
OF
DECRYPTION
THAN
MOST
COMPUTER
COMPANIES
SPEND
ON
RD
I
HAVE
TO
IMAGINE
THEIR
STUFF
IS
REAL
INTERESTING
A
FRIEND
WHO
ONCE
WORKED
FOR
THEM
HE
IS
DEAD
NOW
SAID
HE
ALWAYS
ENJOYED
MONITORING
SACS
STRATEGIC
AIR
COMMAND
CRYPTO
TRAFFIC
AND
I
RATHER
SUSPECT
THAT
STUFF
IS
A
BIT
MORE
COMPLEX
THAN
SKIPJACK
OR
WAS
IT
THE
MILITARY
GOT
THE
STUFF
FROM
THE
NSA
JUST
LIKE
WE
GET
SKIPJACK
FROM
THEM
BTW
FOLKS
NSA
WASNT
BEING
GIVEN
THE
KEYS
AND
THE
WALKER
SPY
CASE
SHOWS
FOR
SOME
OF
THE
SYSTEMS
THE
KGB
DIDNT
NEED
