CLIPPER
AND
CONFERENCE
CALLS
JUST
CURIOUS
HOW
WOULD
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
SYSTEM
HANDLE
CONFERENCE
CALLS
DEPENDING
ON
THE
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEM
SO
LONG
AS
EVERYONE
HAS
THE
SAME
KEY
IT
CAN
BE
DONE
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
WAS
USING
VAT
WHICH
IS
AN
INTERNET
AUDIO
TOOL
FOR
A
CONFERENCE
CALL
AND
WE
WERE
ENCRYPTING
THE
SESSION
UNFORTUNATELY
ONE
SITE
WAS
DOING
MORE
WORK
AND
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
CPU
FOR
IT
SO
IT
DIDNT
SOUND
ALL
THAT
GOOD
AT
A
DIFFERENT
SITE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
USE
SOMETHING
OTHER
THAN
THE
ATT
BLACK
BOX
IN
OTHER
WORDS
I
DONT
THINK
PUBLIC
KEY
WOULD
WORK
THE
SESSION
KEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
AGREED
UPON
PRIOR
TO
THE
CONVERSATION
AND
DISTRIBUTED
TO
ALL
SITES
BEFOREHAND

GO
