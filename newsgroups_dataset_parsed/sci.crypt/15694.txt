they

making

another

on

im

i

im

you
see
my
point
im
a
single
person
but
i
react
differently
on
different
groups
admittedly
in

because
im
a
contrarian
you
always
shouts
but
on
the
other
hand
on

of
that
i
loath
certainty
and
have
taken
public
positions
in
the
past
for
no
reason
other
than
to
challenge
conventional
wisdom
i
wish
them
luck
in
figuring
out
who
i
am
based
on
that
information
they
can
probably
figure
out
im
liberal
with
a
technical
