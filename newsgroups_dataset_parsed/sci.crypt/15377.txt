ELSE
HERE
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
PROTOCOL
THOUGH
IS
ANOTHER
MATTER
I
SEE
NO
VALID
REASONS
FOR
KEEPING
IT
SECRET
AND
AS
I
HOPE
IVE
SHOWN
ABOVE
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
WAYS
TO
DO
THINGS
THAT
ARENT
QUITE
AS
BAD
IT
JUST
OCCURRED
TO
ME
WHY
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
SECRET
IF
IT
WERE
PUBLISHED
ONE
COULD
THEN
BUILD
PHYSICALLY
IDENTICAL
CLONE
VERSIONS
OF
THE
CHIP
THAT
WOULD
INTEROPERATE
WITH
OFFICIAL
CLIPPER
CHIPS
BUT
THE
CLONER
WOULDNT
PROVIDE
THE
KEYS
TO
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
HMMN
YEAH
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
CLASSIFIED
BECAUSE
A
MILITARY
CONTRACT
OR
SIMILAR
GOVERNMENT
EQUIVALENT
TO
MILITARY
HAS
BEEN
LET
FOR
THIS
PROPRIETARY
DESIGN
THAT
THE
FEDS
SAY
THAT
NSA
DEVELOPED
IS
THERE
A
PATENT
IS
THAT
PATENT
PUBLICLY
AVAILABLE
MY
BETTING
IS
THAT
THAT
TOO
IS
CLASSIFIED
IF
THE
ALGORITHM
WERE
MADE
PUBLIC
OR
REVERSEENGINEERED
IT
WOULD
COMPROMISE
NOT
ONLY
THE
GOAL
OF
JUSTICE
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
READ
EVERY
CHIP
USERS
CYPTODATA
BUT
WOULD
REDUCE
PROFITS
FOR
THE
SELECTED
CHIP
MAKER
WOULDNT
THAT
JUST
BE
TOO
BAD
