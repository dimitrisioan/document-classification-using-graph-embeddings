RE
CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
IN
ARTICLE
WCSANCHORHOATTCOM
BILL
STEWART
WRITES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
CAN
EASILY
SEE
THEM
RECORDING
THE
TRAFFIC
FOR
INTERESTING
PEOPLE
SUCH
AS
DISSIDENTS
SUSPECTED
CRIMINALS
FOREIGN
TELEPHONE
CALLS
AND
ANYBODY
NOTICED
USING
ENCRYPTION
AS
KEN
SHIRIFF
SPECULATES
RECORDING
ENCRYPTED
TRAFFIC
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
JUDGED
NOT
TO
BE
AN
INVASION
OF
PRIVACY
PRETTY
SOON
AS
I
READ
THE
CURRENT
WIRETAP
LAW
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
LEGAL
NOW
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ASSUMING
A
LEGISLATIVE
CHANGE
RECORDING
BUT
NOT
DECRYPTING
CLIPPER
CONVERSATIONS
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
FOUND
CONSTITUTIONAL
BY
THE
SUPREME
COURT
USING
THE
SAME
REASONING
OR
THE
LACK
THEREOF
BY
WHICH
THEY
PERMIT
RANDOM
ROADBLOCKS
TO
CHECK
FOR
DRUNK
DRIVERS
INCIDENTALLY
IF
WE
USE
THAT
AS
OUR
MODEL
THE
COURT
WILL
LIKELY
NOT
UPHOLD
SELECTIVE
RECORDING
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
DONT
THINK
THEYVE
THROWN
OUT
DRUG
COURIER
PROFILES
YET
MUST
BE
THAT
EXCEPTION
TO
THE
FOURTH
AMENDMENT
THAT
I
CAN
NEVER
FIND
IN
MY
COPY
OF
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
A
LOT
AND
I
MEAN
A
LOT
WILL
DEPEND
ON
EXACTLY
HOW
CLIPPERTAPS
OR
TIPPERCLAPS
FOR
ENCRYPTED
MUSIC
ARE
USED
DON
ALVAREZ
SHOWED
IN
THE
LATEST
RISKS
DIGEST
THAT
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
PREVENT
THE
COPS
FROM
READING
TRAFFIC
AFTER
THEIR
WARRANT
EXPIRES
THAT
IS
THE
COPS
SEND
THE
LEF
TO
THE
FHOLDER
THE
FHOLDER
STRIPS
OFF
F
AND
SENDS
UKN
TO
THE
ESCROW
AGENTS
THEY
SEND
EITHER
U
OR
K
TO
THE
COPS
DON
SAYS
U
I
SAY
K
THE
COPS
CANT
USE
U
IN
THE
FUTURE
BECAUSE
THEY
CANT
STRIP
OFF
F
THE
FHOLDER
NEVER
SEES
U
IN
DONS
MODEL
THE
ESCROW
AGENTS
CANT
READ
THE
TRAFFIC
BECAUSE
THEY
DONT
HAVE
K
IN
MY
MODEL
THEY
HAVE
K
BUT
NOT
THE
MESSAGE
ITSELF
AND
I
TRUST
THAT
MORE
BECAUSE
I
THINK
THE
COPS
AND
THE
FBI
THE
FHOLDER
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
COLLABORATE
ON
BREAKING
THE
RULES
THE
NET
RESULT
IS
THAT
BY
INVOLVING
THE
FHOLDER
AND
THE
ESCROW
AGENTS
ON
EVERY
TAP
WE
CAN
AVOID
EXTENDING
PERMISSION
TO
TAP
