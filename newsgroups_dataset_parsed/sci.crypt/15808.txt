info
on
mathematics
of
encryption
wanted
i
just
signed
up
for
this
group
so
i
hope
im
not
missing
something
in
a
faq
but
im
looking
for
a
good
introduction
to
the
mathematics
of
encryption
particularly
des
and
publickey
though
others
would
be
interesting
also
probably
a
good
library
could
help
me
out
but
i
thought
it
might
be
even
easier
if
i
could
obtain
a
nice
article
entirely
electronically
besides
i
have
this
rather
rational
phobia
of
libraries
for
reasons
stemming
from
this
dissertation
thing
hanging
over
my
head
i
have
a
basic
knowledge
of
mathematics
numbertheory
is
a
bit
unfamiliar
to
me
but
ive
had
a
few
graduatelevel
math
courses
in
some
other
areas
anyway
im
not
a
complete
novice
to
the
field
so
probably
something
aimed
at
a
basic
graduate
introductory
level
would
be
about
right
something
anyway
which
is
more
specific
than
a
really
big
prime
number
is
generated
to
code
the
message
if
someone
knows
of
a
good
text
available
by
ftp
or
gopher
or
would
like
to
email
me
one
please
let
me
know
ill
probably
keep
reading
this
group
but
it
would
be
nice
if
you
would
email
me
at
the
same
time
so
i
dont
miss
it
thanx
