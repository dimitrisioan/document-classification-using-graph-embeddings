I
WOULDNT
THINK
SO
ASKING
PEOPLE
TO
TRUST
A
SECRET
ALGORITHM
SEEMS
UNSOUND
TO
ME
MAYBE
SO
BUT
ITS
QUITE
COMMON
THERE
ARE
MILLIONS
OF
MACINTOSH
USERS
WHO
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHATS
IN
APPLES
PATENTED

MANY
HAVE
MODEMS
CONNECTED
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
ALL
YOUR
BUSINESS
SECRETS
ARENT
BEING
STOLEN
ANSWER
BECAUSE
YOU
TRUST
APPLE
BECAUSE
IF
ANY
SUCH
ATTEMPT
HOWEVER
SOPHICSTICATED
CAME
OUT
IT
WOULD
DESTROY
APPLES
CREDIBILITY
FOREVER
THEN
THERES
ALSO
BECAUSE
ITS
NOT
SECRET
IF
I
WANT
TO
I
CAN
GO
LOOK
AT

NOT
KEEPING
ANY
SECRETS
YOU
DONT
EVEN
HAVE
TO
PRY
THE

USE
AN

YOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
READ
THE

WHAT
IT
MEANS
MOTOROLA

ALL

SO
I
CANT
GO
SELLING
COPIES
OR
USING
THE

MYSELF
BUT
I
CAN
SEE
IT
AND
DISASSEMBLE
IT
THEYRE
NOT
ASKING
ME

THEIR
HONESTY
THEYRE
ASKING
ME
TO

BUT
I
CAN
SEE
FOR
MYSELF
WHAT
THE
PERFORMANCE

NSA
AN

IS
ASKING
