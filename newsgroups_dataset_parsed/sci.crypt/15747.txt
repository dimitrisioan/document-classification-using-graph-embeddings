in

way
david
our
government
is
totally
out
of
control
whether
you
realize
it
or
not
i
know
you
find
it
painful
to
think
of
your
old
buddy
uncle
sam
as
evil
but
its
true
other
democracies
have
fallen
before
ours
is
on
its
way

kneejerk
sheep
that
instinctively
trust
government
are
helping

david
why
is
that
so
hard
to
understand
that
wasnt
my
point
my
point
is
that
your
implied
position
about
the
waco
massacre
is
an
assertion
cum
political
position
according
to
a
cnn
poll
about
of
americans
think
the
fbi
acted
properly
and
a
majority
think
they
should
have
done
it
the
tear
gas
a
lot
sooner
a
large
majority
also
believe
the
fbi
was
not
at
all
responsible
for
the
death
of
the
victims
koresh
was
lets
avoid
the
kind
of
fruitless
argument
of
the
sort
if
a
hadnt
xd
then
b
might
not
have
yd
what
you
call
the
big
brother
chip
is
right
now
a
proposal
under
discussion
and
it
is
not
yet
clear
that
strong
crypto
is
going
to
be
banned
therefore
neither
justifies
any
tactic
is
fair
thus
the
statement
is
nonsense
it
is
pernicious
because
any
tactic
can
lead
to
damaging
others
as
i
see
you
know
from
the
tone
of
your
reply
theres
nothing
personal
intended
