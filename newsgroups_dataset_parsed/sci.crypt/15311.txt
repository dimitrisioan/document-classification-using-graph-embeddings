i
probably
shouldnt
say
this
but
they
could
try
to
detect
the
use
of
an
illegal
cypher
by
transmitting
in
the
clear
some
statistical
properties
of
the
plaintext
an
oldfashioned
wiretap
could
then
detect
the
use
of
preencryption
which
would
drastically
increase
the
measured
entropy
of
the
input
a
countermeasure
to
this
would
be
to
use
steganographic
techniques
which
put
out
voice
this
way
to
detect
preencryption
may
be
defeated
one
can
do
transformation
of
the
spectrum
of
encrypted
signal
just
by
adding
some
prearranged
in
the
beginning
of
communication
function
i
think
so
say
you
can
do
fft
of
your
encrypted
signal
just
thinking
for
public
key
