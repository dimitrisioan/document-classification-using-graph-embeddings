A
ONEWAY

FUNCTION
A
TYPICAL
ONEWAY
HASH
FUNCTION
TAKES
A
VARIABLELENGTH
MESSAGE
AND
PRODUCES
A

HASH
GIVEN
THE
HASH
IT
IS
COMPUTATIONALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
FIND
A

WITH
THAT
HASH
IN
FACT
ONE
CANT
DETERMINE
ANY
USABLE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
A

WITH

NOT
EVEN
A

FOR
SOME
ONEWAY
HASH

ITS
ALSO
COMPUTATIONALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DETERMINE
TWO

A

FUNCTION
CAN
BE

COMPUTE
THE

THERE
IS
A
HORRENDOUS
MISHMASH
OF

IN
THE
LITERATURE
FOR
A
VERY
SMALL
SET
OF
CONCEPTS
WHEN
AN
ALGORITHM
DEPENDS
ON
A
KEY
WHICH
ISNT
PUBLISHED
WE
CALL
IT
A
PRIVATE
ALGORITHM
OTHERWISE
WE
CALL
IT
A
PUBLIC
ALGORITHM
WE
HAVE

DIGITAL
SIGNATURE

HAVE
PRIVATE
HASHING
AND
PUBLIC

ONLY
ONE
PERSON
CAN
PRODUCE
THE
HASH
FOR
A

BUT
EVERYONE
CAN
VERIFY
THAT
THE
HASH
IS
CORRECT
OBVIOUSLY
WHEN
AN
ALGORITHM
DEPENDS
ON
A
PRIVATE
KEY
ITS
MEANT
TO
BE
UNUSABLE
BY
ANYONE
WHO
DOESNT
HAVE
THE
KEY
THERES
NO
REAL
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
SHARED
KEY
AND
A
PRIVATE
KEY
A
SHARED
KEY
ISNT
PUBLISHED
SO
ITS
PRIVATE
IF
