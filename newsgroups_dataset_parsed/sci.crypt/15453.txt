DANNY

WRITES
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
CLASSIFIED
BECAUSE
A
MILITARY
CONTRACT
OR
SIMILAR
GOVERNMENT
EQUIVALENT
TO
MILITARY
HAS
BEEN
LET
FOR
THIS
PROPRIETARY
DESIGN
THAT
THE
FEDS
SAY
THAT
NSA
DEVELOPED
IS
THERE
A
PATENT
IS
THAT
PATENT
PUBLICLY
AVAILABLE
MY
BETTING
IS
THAT
THAT
TOO
IS
CLASSIFIED
UNLESS
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
MAJOR
CHANGE
IN
THE
LAW
THERES
NO
SUCH
BEAST
AS
A
CLASSIFIED
PATENT
PATENTS
EXIST
TO
ENCOURAGE
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
DEVELOP
THE
STATE
OF
THE
ART
THE
LOCK
IS
A
NUISANCE
BUT
HISTORICALLY
HAS
BEEN
PRETTY
TRIVIAL
ITS
ONLY
IN
AN
INDUSTRY
WHICH
DOUBLES
PERFORMANCE
EVERY
THREE
YEARS
OR
MONTHS
FOR
SOME
HARDWARE
THAT
YEARS
IS
AN
ETERNITY
THE
SAME
THING
APPLIES
IN
CIVILIAN
DEVELOPMENT
YOU
CANT
PATENT
SOMETHING
AND
DECLARE
IT
A
TRADE
SECRET
HOWEVER
YOU
CAN
AND
SHOULD
MARK
ALL
SOFTWARE
INCLUDING
PROPRIETARY
CODE
UNPUBLISHED
COPYRIGHT
SO
THAT
IT
EVER
DOES
GET
EXPOSED
YOU
STILL
HAVE
SOME
LEGAL
PROTECTION
POSTBERNE
THIS
ISNT
REQUIRED
SINCE
EVERYTHING
IS
BORN
COPYRIGHTED
BUT
IT
TAKES
A
WHILE
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
LEARN
