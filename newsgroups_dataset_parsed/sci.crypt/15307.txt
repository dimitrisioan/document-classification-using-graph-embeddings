HM
COULD
ANOTHER

TRY
YOU
VIA
A
BYPASS
OF
THE
DOUBLE
JEOPARDY
AMENDMENT
LIKE
THEY

DOING
IN
THE

A
STATE
JUDGE
AND

A
FEDERAL

NO
THE

OFFICERS
WERE
TRIED
FIRST
BY

SECONDLY
BY
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
ON
DEPRIVING

TREASON
AIDING
AN
ENEMY

HEARINGS
UNDER

ON
CRIMINAL
CHARGES
HAD
TO
SEQUESTER
ITSELF
FROM
ALL
REPORTS
OF
ONS
IMMUNIZED
TESTIMONY
ONS
LAWYER
BROUGHT
UP
THE
PROBABILITY
THAT
AT
LEAST
SOMEONE
ON
THE
TEAM
HAD
HEARD
ABOUT
THE
SENATE
TESTIMONY
AND
IT
WAS
A
STRONG
FACTOR
AGAINST
THE
PROSECUTION
WHICH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
THIS
ON
IS
STILL
WALKING
AROUND
FREE
TODAY
