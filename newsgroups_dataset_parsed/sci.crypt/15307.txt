oh
how
will
they
get
you
now
im
not
saying
that
they
wont
or
cant
or
even
that
they
shouldnt
but
what
legal
mechanism
will
they
use
should
we
be
crossposting
this
to
misclegal
hm
could
another
court
try
you
via
a
bypass
of
the
double
jeopardy
amendment
like
they
are
doing
in
the
lapd
trial
ie
your
judge
is
a
state
judge
and
then
a
federal
judge
retries
you
under
the
justification
that
its
not
the
same
trail
no
the
lapd
officers
were
tried
first
by
the
state
of
california
on
charges
of
police
brutality
and
secondly
by
the
federal
government
on
depriving
rk
of
his
civil
rights
a
different
crime
the
scenario
i
outline
is
more
similar
to
the
oliver
north
trial
ollie
confessed
to
treason
aiding
an
enemy
of
the
us
during
senate
hearings
under
immunity
the
team
which
was
later
to
prosecute
him
on
criminal
charges
had
to
sequester
itself
from
all
reports
of
ons
immunized
testimony
ons
lawyer
brought
up
the
probability
that
at
least
someone
on
the
team
had
heard
about
the
senate
testimony
and
it
was
a
strong
factor
against
the
prosecution
which
is
one
of
the
reasons
this
on
is
still
walking
around
free
today
