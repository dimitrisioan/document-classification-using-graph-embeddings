the
escrow
databases
arent
the
sorts
of
secrets
that
our
teachers
told
us
about
but
they
are
the
sort
of
big
secrets
they
would
lump
into
this
category
imagine
trying
to
replace
million
clipper
chips
sounds
to
me
like
a
great
gimmick
for
a
replacement
marketevery
so
often
issue
a
clipper
alert
announcing
that
some
key
backup
tapes
are
missing
that
some
drug
lords
got
em
whatever
then
the
owners
of
these
clipperphones
have
to
trot
down
to
their
local
key
escrow
agency
and
buy
new
chips
and
have
them
programmed
microtoxin
the
clipper
supplier
will
make

this
was
the
real
idea
anybody
know
if

stock
in
microtoxin
vlsi
technology
or
att
could
be
a
good
opportunity
to
undermine
this
with
some

float
rumors
that
the
key

has
been
stolen
all
the
chips

it
angers
people
undermines
confidence
even
more

kills
