BILLS
SPECULATION
IF
THERE
IS
A
BACKDOOR
IN
RSAREF
AND
IF
PKP
IS
SUPPORTED
SECRETLY
BY
THE
NSA
THEN
IT
IS
MORE
THAN
NATURAL
THAT
THEY
WILL
WELCOME
ANY
PUBLICKEY
IMPLEMENTATION
THAT
USES
RSAREF
AND
WILL
STRONGLY
OPPOSE
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
ANY
IMPLEMENTATION
THAT

MY
SPECULATION
DOES
NOT
INCLUDE
OR
DEPEND
UPON
A

I
DO
NOT

THAT
RSA
WOULD
CONSENT
TO
SUCH
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE

IT
HAS
A

WITHIN

IT
PROBABLY
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
PURSUE
THOSE
