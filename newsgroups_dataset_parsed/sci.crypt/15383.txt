NEWSPAPERS
EXPLAIN
WHY
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
INITIATIVE
IS
A
BAD
IDEA
REMEMBER
TO
TAILOR
IT
TO
YOUR
AUDIENCE
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
MAY
BE
SLOW
TO
GRASP
WHY
ITS
A
BAD
IDEA
SINCE
IT
SEEMS
SO
TECHNICAL
AND
ARCANE
AND
INNOCENT
SOUNDING
TRY
NOT
TO
COME
ACROSS
AS
A
FLAMING
LIBERTARIAN
PARANOID
EXTREMIST
EVEN
IF
YOU
ARE
ONE
AS
A
FLAMING
LIBERTARIAN
PARANOID
EXTREMIST
IAT
A
LOSS
FOR
SPECIFIC
OBJECTIONS
THAT
DONT
SOUND
FRIGHTENINGLY
TECHNICAL
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
PERHAPS
SOMEBODY
COULD
POST
A
LIST
OF
THESE
MOBILIZE
OPPOSITION
IN
INDUSTRY
COMPANIES
THAT
WILL
PRESUMABLY
DEVELOP
PRODUCTS
THAT
WILL
INCORPORATE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
SHOULD
BE
LOBBIED
AGAINST
IT
FROM
WITHIN
AND
FROM
WITHOUT

YOU

VENDOR
FIRST
ENLIST
THE
AID
OF
YOUR
COWORKERS
AND
FELLOW
ENGINEERS
AGAINST
THIS
INITIATIVE
AND
THEN
PRESENT
YOUR
COMPANYS
MANAGEMENT
WITH
A
UNITED
FRONT
OF
ENGINEERING
TALENT
AGAINST
THIS
INITIATIVE
WRITE
PERSUASIVE
MEMOS
TO
YOUR
MANAGEMENT
WITH
YOUR
NAME
AND
YOUR
COLLEAGUES
NAMES
ON
IT
HOLD
MEETINGS
ON
IT
ONE
WAY
TO
DO
THIS
MIGHT
BE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THESE
COMPANIES
SHOULD
BE
IMPLEMENTING
THEIR
OWN
SCHEMES
NOT
BEING
LIMITED
TO
THE
GOVTS
SCHEME
I
FIND
THAT
MOST
OF
MY
REASONS
FOR
OPPOSITION
TO
THE
CLIPPER
SCHEME
ARE
ALGORITM
INSECURITY
AND
MISTRUST
OF
THE
GOVTNSA
THESE
ARE
HARD
TO
SELL
IN
LETTERS
TO
THE
EDITOR
AND
TO
NONTECHNICAL
PEOPLE
ANY
HINTS
OR
ADVICE
MAYBE
A
SMALL
FAQTYPE
THING
WHY
SHOULD
I
HATE
CLIPPER
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
IDEA
