GRAHAM
TOAL
WRITES
I
FORWARDED
AN
OLD
POSTING
ABOUT
CELP
SPEECH
COMPRESSION
IVE
SINCE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THE
SOURCE
OF
THIS
IS
ON
CYGNUSCOM
IN
PUBCELPSPEECHTARZ
IM
NOT
IN
A
POSITION
TO
ANY
SUN
TCPIP
GURUS
OUT
THERE
WHO
THINK
THEY
CAN
MARRY
THIS
WITH
NETFONE
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
WEEK
SERIOUSLY
I
THINK
SOMEONE
WITH
REAL
NET
ACCESS
AND
TWO
SPARCS
COULD
HAVE
THIS
RUNNING
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
WEEK
THEN
WE
ASK
THE
PGP
GUYS
TO
ADD
A
BYTESTREAM
CRYPTO
FILTER
TWO
WEEKS
AT
THE
MOST
DAMN
I
WISH
I
HAD
MY
SPARC
BACK
IM
STUCK
ON
A
I
TRIED
THIS
CODE
YESTERDAY
ON
MY
SPARCSTATION
ELC
IT
TAKES
OVER
SECONDS
TO
COMPRESS
SECONDS
WORTH
OF
SPEECH
THIS
MEANS
THAT
IT
NEEDS
TO
BE
OPTIMIZED
BY
OVER
A
FACTOR
OF
BEFORE
IT
WILL
BE
USABLE
IN
EVEN
A
HALFDUPLEX
MODE
I
QUESTION
WHETHER
CELP
IS
THE
BEST
APPROACH
FOR
THIS
APPLICATION
IT
PRODUCES
GREAT
COMPRESSION
BUT
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
TREMENDOUS
CPU
LOADS
WE
WANT
SOMETHING
THAT
CAN
BE
RUN
ON
ORDINARY
WORKSTATIONS
OR
EVEN
HIGHEND
PCS
WITHOUT
DSP
CARDS
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
SOME
OTHER
ALGORITHM
IS
GOING
TO
BE
A
BETTER
STARTING
POINT
