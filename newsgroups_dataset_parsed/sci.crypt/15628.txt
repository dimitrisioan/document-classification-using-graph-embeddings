ACTUALLY
THE
GOVRNMENT
IS
TELLING
YOU
THAT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
USE
THEIR
PRODUCT
THE
MANUFACTURER
ACTUALLY
BETTER
YET
SOME
TRUSTED
PAIR
OF
ESCROW
AGENCIES
HAS
TO
HAVE
THE
KEY
MOST
OF
US
ALREADY
ARE
IN
THIS
SITUATIONOUR
CAR
MAKERS
HAVE
KEYS
TO
OUR
CARS
OR
CAN
GET
THEM
QUICKLY
FROM
THE
VIN
NUMBER
AND
I
HAVE
NO
DOUBT
THAT
IF
PRESENTED
WITH
A
COURT
ORDER
THEYD
SURRENDER
COPIES
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
CHANCES
ARE
THAT
MANY
LOCKSMITHS
HAVE
THE
CODE
NUMBERS
FOR
HOUSE
LOCKS
THEYVE
INSTALLED
AND
IN
AN
EMERGENCY
CAN
CUT
KEYS
THUS
THEYD
ALSO
PROVIDE
SUCH
KEYS
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
PURSUANT
TO
A
COURT
ORDER
OF
COURSE
NOTHING
PREVENTS
YOU
FROM
BUYING
A
NEW
LOCK
WITH
CASH
AND
INSTALLING
IT
YOURSELF
EVEN
MODIFYING
THE
CORE
TO
MATCH
SOME
ARBITRARY
KEY
IS
NOT
DIFFICULT
TO
DO
AT
HOME
I
ONCE
KNEW
SOMEONE
WHO
HAD
FIXED
HIS
LOCKS
IN
THIS
WAY
HIS
HOUSE
OFFICE
AND
CARS
ALL
TOOK
THE
SAME
KEY
WHICH
HE
TOOK
GOOD
CARE
OF
THE
STATE
HAS
NO
DIFFICULTY
GAINING
ACCESS
TO
YOUR
SAFE
DEPOSIT
BOX
IF
THEY
HAVE
A
COURT
ORDER
BAD
ANALOGY
VERY
BAD
YOURS
THAT
IS
HAVE
YOU
EVER
HAD
A
SAFETY
DEPOSIT
BOX
THEY
WORK
ON
A
TWOKEY
SYSTEM
THE
BANK
CLERK
HAS
ONE
AND
YOU
HAVE
THE
OTHER
THEY
ARE
DIFFERENT
KEYS
THE
BANK
DOES
NOT
KEEP
A
COPY
OF
YOUR
KEY
IF
YOU
LOSE
IT
THEY
HAVE
TO
DRILL
OUT
THE
LOCK
AND
REPLACE
THE
DOOR
THIS
IS
A
TIME
CONSUMING
AND
EXPENSIVE
PROCESS
WHICH
THEY
WILL
BE
HAPPY
TO
CHARGE
TO
YOUR
ACCOUNT
THIS
PROCESS
IS
EXACTLY
ANALOGOUS
TO
HAVING
A
PRIVATE
KEY
WHICH
IS
NOT
IN
A
ESCROW
SYSTEM
AND
THE
STATE
HAVING
TO
CRACK
YOUR
CIPHER
TO
GET
THE
DATA
PLEASE
DO
NOT
USE
FALSE
ANALOGIES
