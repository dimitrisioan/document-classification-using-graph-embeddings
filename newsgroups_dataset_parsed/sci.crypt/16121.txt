ISNT
IS
THE

ARE
MEDIA
MEANS
MORE
THAN
ONE
MEDIUM
THERE
ARE
THOUSANDS
OF
PUBLICATIONS
SOME
SAY
THIS
SOME
SAY
THAT
HOW
CAN
THE
BULK
OF
THE
PEOPLE
BE
INFORMED
WHEN
THEY
WONT
READ
INFORMATIVE
PUBLICATIONS
BECAUSE
MUCH
OF
THE
PUBLIC
ARENT
EVEN
AWARE
OF
THE
NAMES
OF
INFORMATIVE
PUBLICATIONS
LOOK
AT
THE
WEALTH

ALL
THEY

IS
THE

NOTE
MEDIA
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
IS
THE
POPULAR

TV
RADIO
DAILY
NEWSPAPERS
AND
SUCH
PUBLICATIONS
AS

NEWSWEEK
AND
ALL
THAT
AND
THEY
ALL
SAY
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
THING
I
SEE
MOST
OF
THEM
BEING
IN
THE
RANGE
OF
CENTERLEFT
TO
FAR

AND
GENERALLY
SUPPORTIVE
OF

THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
AIR
OF
ARROGANCE
THAT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
IS
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
MAJOR
ISSUES
SO
THE
MEDIA
DOESNT
BOTHER
TO
INFORM
THEM
AS
WITH
CLIPPER
FOR
EXAMPLE
OR
TELLS
THE
PEOPLE
HOW
TO
INTERPRET
EVENTS
IN
OTHERS
WHAT
IS
LOST
SIGHT
OF
IS
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
GOOD
AT
UNDERSTANDING
THINGS
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
TOLD
ACCURATE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THEM
IT
IS
A
LOT
TO
EXPECT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
FOR
THEM
TO
BE
CLARIRVOYANT
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
UNAWARE
OF

HAD
I
NOT
PICKED
IT

HOW
MUCH
OF
THE

HAS
USENET

INTERNET
ACCESS

THE

MANY
FOLKS
ESPECIALLY
WHO
WORK
LONG

HAVE
FAMILIES
ETC
DO
NOT
HAVE
TIME
TO
GO
DIGGING
AND
MANY
ARE
NOT
YET
AWARE
THINGS
ARE
WRONG
SO
ARE
NOT
MOTIVATED
TO
DIG
NOT
SAYING
ITS
RIGHT
JUST
SAYING
THAT
IS
THE
WAY
THINGS
ARE
PEOPLE
ARENT
UPSET
ABOUT
THINGS
WHEN
THEY
ARENT
TOLD
AND
THE
LESS
THAN
OBJECTIVE
MEDIA
IS
A
MAJOR
CONTRIBUTER
TO
THE
PROBLEM
AND
THEN
COMPOUND
THAT
WITH
AN
ATTITUDE
OF
ARROGANCE

ACT
