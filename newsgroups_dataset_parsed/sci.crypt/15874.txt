posts
an
interesting
firsthand
message
about
his
nea
algorithm
though
i
have
no
reason
to
disbelieve
anything
he
says
i
want
to
clarify
one
point
he
says
he
has
no
connection
with
the
nsa
if
he
was
part
of
an
nsa
plot
of
course
hed
say
that
now
i
dont
think
he
is
but
the
level
of
some
discussion
here
is
of
that
sort
and
very
quickly
we
reach
the
point
where
its
impossible
to
continue
rationally
discussing
some
issues
i
am
not
a
crook
well
if
you
were
of
course
youd
say
that
or
the
ever
popular
favorite
please
prove
the
following
negative
i
dont
know
what
to
do
with
such
messages
so
i
have
taken
to
ignoring
them
