RE
SECRET
ALGORITHM
RE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
CRYPTO
KEYESCROW
AFTER
READING
THE
DEBATE
OVER
THE
CLIPPER
I
HAVE
A
FEW
THINGS
TO
ADD
FIRST
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
WHO
ACTIVLY
USE
ENCRYPTION
PRIVATELY
DO
NOT
CARE
ABOUT
MOST
OF
THE
ISSUES
THAT
SURROUND
THIS
DEBATE
AND
ANY
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
OR
IS
NOT
OK
TO
USE
IN
THE
US
ALL
THEY
CARE
ABOUT
IS
WETHER
OR
NOT
WHAT
THEY
ARE
USING
IS
SECURE
OR
NOT
THAT
AFTER
ALL
IS
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
SECOND
IF
I
LOOK
AT
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
WHO
USE
ANY
FORM
OF
ENCRYPTION
AT
ALL
AND
THIS
GROUP
SPANS
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
MORONS
WHO
STILL
INSIST
THAT
THE
DES
IS
A
GOOD
AND
SECURE
STANDARD
TO
PEOPLE
LOOKING
AT
TRYING
TO
IMPROVE
UPON
EXISTING
STRATEGIES
I
CAN
NOT
THINK
OF
ANYONE
OF
THEM
WHO
WOULD
APPROVE
BLINDLY
OF
A
STRATEGY
THAT
LEAVES
THEIR
METHODS
OPEN
TO
ABUSE
THE
CLIPPER
DOES
THIS
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
MAKE
MISTAKES
BY
NATURE
AND
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
IS
MADE
UP
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
JUST
AS
VULNERABLE
TO
MISTAKES
AS
EVERYONE
ELSE
THIRD
SINCE
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
ARE
AT
LEAST
MARGINALY
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
VULNERABILITIES
PRESENT
IN
CURRENT
SOFTWARE
ENCRYPTION
STRATIGIES
I
CANT
SEE
HOW
MOST
OF
THEM
ARE
GOING
TO
BLINDLY
TRUST
THAT
SOMEONE
WILL
NOT
FIGURE
OUT
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
COMPROMISE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
THAT
DESPITE
ANY
STRENGTHS
OR
WEAKNESSES
THAT
MAY
EXIST
IN
IT
SO
I
CAN
NOT
SEE
A
HIGH
DEGREE
OF
CONFIDENCE
DEVELOPING
IN
THE
CHIP
FOURTH
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
CRIMINAL
ABUSE
SURE
THERE
ARE
MANY
STUPID
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
AND
YES
SOME
WILL
BE
OPEN
TO
BEING
CAUGHT
VIA
THE
BUILT
IN
BACK
DOOR
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
HOWEVER
ANYONE
WHO
IS
GOING
TO
DO
ANY
SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION
OF
HOW
BEST
TO
SECURE
THEIR
DATA
IS
GOING
TO
RUN
INTO
THAT
PROBLEM
PRETTY
DAMNED
FAST
AND
I
WOULD
ASSUME
START
LOOKING
AROUND
FOR
OTHER
EASILY
OBTAINIBLE
METHODS
OF
ENCRYPTION
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
WERE
AVALIBLE
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
BE
AN
ISSUE
HOWEVER
THE
TRUTH
IS
THAT
MOST
PRIVATE
ENCRYPTION
USERS
THAT
IVE
EVER
RUN
INTO
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
GIVE
A
DAMN
ABOUT
THE
LEGAL
STATUS
OF
RSA
OR
PGP
OR
ANYTHING
ELSE
IF
IT
WORKS
THEY
USE
IT
THIS
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
CHANGE
EITHER
I
DO
NOT
THINK
FOR
A
MOMENT
THAT
ANYONE
WITH
SERIOUS
CRIMINAL
INTENT
WILL
BE
SLOWED
DOWN
BY
THE
ADVENT
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IT
IS
ALL
TO
EASY
TO
CONVERT
ENCRYPTED
DATA
INTO
UNINTELLGIBLE
GARBAGE
AS
IT
IS
IF
ANYTHING
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
JUST
ADDS
ANOTHER
TOOL
TO
THE
USER
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
HERE
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
WILL
USE
WHAT
WORKS
AND
UNAVOIDIBLY
IM
SURE
MOST
CRIMINALS
WOULD
RATHER
FACE
AN
ENCRYPTION
RELATED
CHARGE
THAN
ONE
WHICH
COULD
POTENTIALY
LEAD
TO
DEATH
PENALTY
CHARGES
IN
THE
CASE
OF
CRIMINALS
WHO
MURDER
AS
PART
OF
THEIR
CONSPIRICY
THE
OTHER
THING
THAT
HAS
STRUCK
ME
SINCE
THE
ADVENT
AND
WIDE
USEAGE
OF
PUBLIC
ENCRYPTION
HAS
BEGUN
IS
THAT
QUITE
SIMPLY
THE
CAT
IS
OUT
OF
THE
BAG
OR
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
INTEREST
IN
SNOOPING
PANDORAS
BOX
HAS
BEEN
OPENED
AND
THIS
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
CHANGE
IVE
SEEN
A
BLINDNESS
TO
THIS
THAT
IVE
FOUND
UTTERLY
STUNNING
AND
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
ALONG
WITH
THE
WAY
IT
HAS
BEEN
PRESENTED
ONLY
CONFIRMS
