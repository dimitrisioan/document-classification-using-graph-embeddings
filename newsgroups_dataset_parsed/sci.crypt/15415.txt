MY
RESPONSE
TO
DR
DENNINGS
LETTER
TO
STEVEN
BELLOVIN
COMMENTS
ARE
INVITED
PAUL
IN
ALTPRIVACYCLIPPER
STEVE
BELLOVIN
POSTED
YOUR
MESSAGE
TO
HIM
WHICH
INCLUDED
A
BRIEF
PASSAGE
CONCERNING
SELECTION
OF
AGENCIES
AS
ESCROW
AGENCIES
I
AM
GLAD
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
PROPOSAL
AS
WRITTEN
STATES
THAT
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
WONT
BE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
I
WOULD
ARGUE
HOWEVER
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
SHOULDNT
BE
FEDERAL
AT
ALL
AS
A
PRIVATE
CITIZEN
I
WOULD
FEEL
MUCH
MORE
SECURE
IN
MY
PERSON
AND
PAPERS
KNOWING
THAT
AN
ORGANIZATION
COMMITTED
TO
INDIVIDUAL
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
NRA
COME
TO
MIND
WAS
SAFEGUARDING
HALF
OF
MY
KEY
BOTH
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
NRA
ARE
RESISTENT
TO
GOVERNMENT
PRESSURE
BY
THE
SIMPLE
EXPEDIENT
FACT
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
SUPPORTED
FUNDED
OR
OVERTLY
CONTROLLED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
THOSE
FEDERAL
AND
FEDERALLY
FUNDED
CANDIDATE
AGENCIES
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
I
HAVE
THE
FOLLOWING
COMMENTS
SRI
RAND
MITRE
AND
NATIONAL
LABS
I
AGREE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
GREAT
EXPERIENCE
SAFEGUARDING
SENSITIVE
INFORMATION
I
AM
NOT
CONVINCED
THAT
THEY
WOULD
ADEQUATELY
SAFEGUARD
THIS
INFORMATION
SINCE
IN
ANY
CASE
REQUIRING
DISCLOSURE
THERES
LIKELY
TO
BE
SIGIFICANT
PRESSURE
FOR
DISCLOSURE
POSSIBLY
WRONGFUL
DISCLOSURE
GAO
PERHAPS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
MORE
CONCRETE
EVIDENCE
OF
THEIR
FIDELITY
AND
ABILITY
TREASURY
SURELY
YOURE
JOKING
PERHAPS
YOUD
ASK
BATF
TO
SAFEGUARD
KEYS
MAYBE
THE
FEDERAL
RESERVE
WOULD
BE
A
BETTER
CHOICE
EVER
SINCE
LAST
FALLS
TRIAL
BALLOON
WAS
POSTED
IN
SCICRYPT
YOUR
NAME
HAS
BEEN
SYNONYMOUS
WITH
THOSE
WHO
PLACE
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
TRUST
IN
THE
ABILITY
OF
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
AND
AGENTS
TO
ACT
WITHIN
THE
LAW
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
IN
PART
THOSE
AGENCIES
AND
AGENTS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
ACT
PROPERLY
HOWEVER
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
ENOUGH
CASES
WHERE
SWORN
AGENTS
OF
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
HAVE
ACTED
WRONGLY
TO
MAKE
ME
FEEL
THAT
HAVING
TWO
FEDERAL
AGENCIES
AS
KEY
REPOSITORIES
IS
UNACCEPTABLE
