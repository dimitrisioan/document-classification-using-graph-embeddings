SECRECY
IN
CLIPPER
CHIP
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IS
ENCRYPTED
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
KEY
AND
TRANSMITTED
AS
ONE
PART
OF
A
THREE
PART
MESSAGE
PRESUMABLY
THE
PROTOCOL
CAN
BE
RECOVERED
IF
BY
NOTHING
ELSE
DIFFERENTIAL
ANALYSIS
POSTULATE
IF
YOU
WILL
A
CHIP
OR
LOGIC
SITTING
BETWEEN
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
ITS
COMMUNICATIONS
CHANNEL
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
CHIP
IS
TWOFOLD
TRANSMIT
CHANNEL
THE
SPOOF
CHIP
XORS
THE
BIT
ENCRYPTED
SERIAL
NUMBER
WITH
A
SECONDARY
KEYING
VARIABLE
THIS
RENDERS
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
UNRECOVERABLE
WITH
JUST
THE
SYSTEM
KEY
RECIEVE
CHANNEL
THE
SPOOF
CHIP
XORS
THE
INCOMING
ENCRYPTED
SERIAL
NUMBER
WITH
A
SECONDARY
KEYING

ASSUMING
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
LOCAL
OPERATION
THIS
HAS
THE
NET
RESULT
OF
HIDING
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
THIS
GETS
MORE
INTERESTING
WHEN
THE
NUMBER
OF
SERIAL
NUMBERS
ISSUED
BECOMES
LARGE
MAKING
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
VALID
SERIAL
NUMBERS
AND
A
SPOOFED
SERIAL
NUMBER
WITHOUT
KNOWING
THE
SYSTEM
KEY
YOU
COULD
LIE
ABOUT
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
BUT
RISK
DETECTION
OF
THE
LIE
IF
YOU
HAD
THE
SYSTEM
KEY
AND
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
YOU
COULD
SUCCESSFULLY
LIE
WITH
A
LOWER
PROBABILITY
OF
DETECTION
BY
EMULATING
THE
FORMAT
OF
YOUR
OWN
SERIAL
NUMBER
MAKES
YOU
WONDER
WHATS
BEING
HIDDEN
HERE
SEEMS
LIKE
THE
SECRECY
IS
TO
PREVENT
YOU
FROM
LYING
ABOUT
WHO
YOU
ARE
