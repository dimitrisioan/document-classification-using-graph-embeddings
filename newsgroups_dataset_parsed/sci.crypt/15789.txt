really
none
of
this
stuff
is
especially
hard
all
you
need
for
a
true
private
phone
is
an
isdn
codec
a
vocoder
either
a
chip
or
software
an
encryptor
a
chip
is
fine
but
software
is
more
than
fast
enough
a
or
modem
module
and
maybe
a
microcontroller
to
run
the
whole
thing
its
easy
to
do
its
cheap
and
any
normal
company
trying
to
put
one
out
will
likely
get
a
visit
from
the
boys
in
the
dark
suits
from
washington
just
like
qualcomm
did
have
the
feds
shut
down
the
people
making
sound
blaster
what
about
apple
and
next
apple
next
sun
and
others
make
systems
that
can
handle
cdquality
audio
in
and
out
and
can
perform
arbitrary
transformation
on
it
in
the
process
of
transmitting
it
across
a
network
or
modem
perhaps
theres
a
market
for
a
portable
vocoder
not
a
crypto
device
simply
an
converter
make
it
capable
of
recording
speech
and
playing
it
back
simultaneously
it
has
applications
for
multimedia
computing
for
the
handicapped
internet
talk
radio
irc
etc
etc
etc
it
wouldnt
be
a
cryptographic
device
at
all
but
i
suppose
someone
could
have
it
hooked
to
a
laptop
with
a
modem
and
some
crypto
software
id
market
the
thing
with
an
api
for
texttospeech
using
simple
phonemes
and
the
ability
to
use
speech
samples
and
of
course
id
publish
the
interface
to
it
so
other
folks
could
write
any
applications
they
wanted
to
talk
to
the
thing
