KEYESCROW
THE
COPSFEDS
DO
NOT
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
HOLD
OF
YOUR
PRIVATE
KEY
TO
LISTEN
IN
TO
CELLULAR
CONVERSATIONS
ENCRYPTION
IS
NOT
ENDTOEND
BUT
CELLPHONE
TO
BASESTATION
IT
HAS
TO
BE
THIS
WAY
SO
THAT
CELLULAR
USERS
AND
FIXED
INSTALLATIONS
CAN
TALK
TO
EACH
OTHER
FOR
CELLULAR
TO
CELLULAR
CALLS
THE
TRANSMISSION
IS
DECRYPTED
AT
THE
BASESTATION
PASSED
TO
ANOTHER
BASESTATION
AND
REENCRYPTED
THE
COPSFEDS
CAN
LISTEN
TO
THE
UNSCRAMBLED
CALL
PROVIDED
THEY
GET
A
WARRANT
TO
TAP
INTO
THE
CELLULAR
PROVIDERS
EQUIPMENT
THE
ONLY
REASON
FOR
WANTING
A
CRACKABLE
SYSTEM
IS
SO
THEY
CAN
LISTEN
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
OBTAIN
A
WARRANT
BUT
MAYBE
THE
CLIPPER
SYSTEM
IS
SECURE
AND
THEY
REALLY
DO
NEED
A
WARRANT
TO
GET
THE
KEY
OUT
OF
ESCROW
BEFORE
THEY
CAN
LISTEN
IN
USING
A
SCANNER
SEE
ABOVE
THEY
DONT
HAVE
TO
GO
DOWN
THIS
ROUTE
ANYWAY
I
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
BUT
EVEN
IF
TRUE
ONCE
THEY
HAVE
THE
KEY
THEY
WILL
NEVER
AGAIN
NEED
A
WARRANT
TO
TAP
INTO
THAT
PARTICULAR
PHONE
WHENEVER
THEY
WANT
WELL
JUDGE
IT
APPEARS
HE
WASNT
A
DRUGDEALER
AFTER
ALL
SO
NATURALLY
WELL
STOP
LISTENING
IN
THAT
WAS
TRUE
FOR
THE
UK
PAUL
BUT
IM
FAIRLY
SURE
THEYRE
TALKING
ABOUT
BUILDING
ENDTOEND
ENCRYPTION
PHONES
OUT
OF
THIS
CHIP
ITS
NOT
FOR
CELLULAR
THOUGH
IT
CERTAINLY
COULD
BE
USED
THERE
IN
THE
WAY
YOU
SUGGEST
