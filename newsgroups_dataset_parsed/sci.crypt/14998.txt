if
i
had
a
program
on
my
disk
which
created
totally
random
files
looking
like
encrypted
messages
and
could
demonstrate
that
the
file
in
question
could
have
been
created
by
that
program
then
my
claim
that
it
was
in
fact
created
by
that
program
must
stand
as
true
since
im
innocent
unless
someone
can
prove
me
wrong
hmmm
that
brings
up
a
neat
idea
unfortunately
its
sooo
neat
i
think
i
ought
to
patent
it
so
i
cant
tell
you
about
it
