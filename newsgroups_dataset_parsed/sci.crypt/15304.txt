REMOTE
FILE
SYSTEM
SECURITY
IN
LIGHT
OF
MY
RECENT
PARANOIA
CONCERNING
GOVERNMENT
PROPOSALS
ID
LOVE
TO
SEE
A
UNIXBASED
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
THAT
KEPT
SOME
FILES
ENCRYPTED
ON
THE
HOST
MACHINE
SAY
ALL
THE
FILES
IN
YOUR
HOME
DIRECTORY
USED
A
KEY
SYSTEM
THAT
COULD
NOT
BE
COMPROMISED
BY
EAVESDROPPING
OVER
A
MODEM
LINE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THIS
WOULD
REQUIRE
MODIFICATIONS
TO
A
SHELL
PROGRAM
AND
A
WAY
OF
TELLING
WHETHER
A
FILE
WAS
ENCRYPTED
OR
NOT
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
ID
LOVE
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
POTENTIAL
SECURITY
HOLES
IN
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
DOES
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
EXIST
IF
IT
WERE
MADE
EASYTOUSE
AND
READILY
AVAILABLE
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
THINGTM
I
REALIZE
THAT
THIS
WOULD
PROBABLY
JUST
INVOLVE
PUTTING
A
NICE
FRONTEND
ON
A
READILY
AVAILABLE
AND
VERY
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
BUT
IT
SHOULD
BE
DONE
THANKS
FOR
THE
EAR
