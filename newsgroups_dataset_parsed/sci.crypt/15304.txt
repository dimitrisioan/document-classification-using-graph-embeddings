remote
file
system
security
in
light
of
my
recent
paranoia
concerning
government
proposals
id
love
to
see
a
unixbased
encryption
scheme
that
kept
some
files
encrypted
on
the
host
machine
say
all
the
files
in
your
home
directory
used
a
key
system
that
could
not
be
compromised
by
eavesdropping
over
a
modem
line
it
seems
that
this
would
require
modifications
to
a
shell
program
and
a
way
of
telling
whether
a
file
was
encrypted
or
not
among
other
things
id
love
to
know
about
potential
security
holes
in
such
a
system
does
such
a
system
exist
if
it
were
made
easytouse
and
readily
available
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thingtm
i
realize
that
this
would
probably
just
involve
putting
a
nice
frontend
on
a
readily
available
and
very
secure
encryption
scheme
but
it
should
be
done
thanks
for
the
ear
