a
person
i
know
belonging
to
a
research
lab
of
a
rivate
company
claimed
to
me
during
a
priavte
conversation
that
given
the
equipment
in
his
lab
he
could
crack
a
kerberos
ticket
in
minutes
to
an
hour
he
had
access
to
rather
powerful
des
hardware
but
not
of
an
extraordinare
kind
i
believe
the
attack
was
possible
because
of
the
amount
of
known
plaintext
in
the
ticket
which
itself
constitutes
a
small
message
this
was
two
years
ago
des
is
no
longer
usable
for
encryption
of
really
sensitive
data
for
a
lot
of
purposes
however
it
is
still
very
adequate
this
sounds
an
awful
lot
like
a
passwordguesser
not
a
weakness
in
des
merritt
and
i
pointed
out
this
weakness
in
kerberos
in
a
paper
that
came
out
about
years
ago
in
both
computer
communications
review
and
usenix
for
that
matter
it
was
loudly
discussed
on
the
kerberos
mailing
list
even
earlier
the
problem
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
des
and
everything
to
do
with
bad
password
selection
im
perfectly
willing
to
believe
that
there
are
cryptanalytic
attacks
possible
on
des
im
quite
dubious
that
private
research
labs
know
them
and
the
parameters
of
a
bruteforce
attack
are
quite
well
established
see
for
example
the
garon
and
outerbridge
paper
in
the
july
cryptologia
youre
not
going
to
do
it
in
an
hour
with
only
rather
powerful
des
hardware
ill
leave
the
arithmetic
as
an
exercise
for
the
reader
on
average
youll
need
to
do
trials
pick
your
own
parameters
for
how
fast
the
des
engine
runs
and
for
how
many
such
engines
are
used
