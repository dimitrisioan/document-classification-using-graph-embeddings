RE
WH
ANNOUNCEMENT
Q
WHO
WAS
CONSULTED
THE
CONGRESS
INDUSTRY
A
WE
HAVE
ONGOING
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
CONGRESS
AND
INDUSTRY
ON
ENCRYPTION
ISSUES
AND
EXPECT
THOSE
DISCUSSIONS
TO
INTENSIFY
AS
WE
CARRY
OUT
OUR
REVIEW
OF
ENCRYPTION
POLICY
WE
HAVE
BRIEFED
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS
AND
INDUSTRY
LEADERS
ON
THE
DECISIONS
RELATED
TO
THIS
INITIATIVE
CONGRESS
SO
WERE
PLAYING
POLITICS
BEFORE
WE
TALK
TO
CPSR
ACADEMIA
THE
PUBLIC
INTERNET
USERS
IVE
HEARD
OF
TOPDOWN
DESIGN
BUT
TOPDOWN
DEMOCRACY
JUST
WHOSE
STATEDISTRICT
ARE
THE
CHIP
MANUFACTURERS
IN
Q
IF
THE
ADMINISTRATION
WERE
UNABLE
TO
FIND
A
TECHNOLOGICAL
SOLUTION
LIKE
THE
ONE
PROPOSED
WOULD
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BE
WILLING
TO
USE
LEGAL
REMEDIES
TO
RESTRICT
ACCESS
TO
MORE
POWERFUL
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
A
THIS
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
POLICY
QUESTION
WHICH
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED
DURING
THE
BROAD
POLICY
REVIEW
BS
ABOUT
THE
WONDERFULNESS
OF
THE
KEY
ESCROW
SYSTEM
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
NOT
SAYING
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
THREATENS
THE
PUBLIC
SAFETY
AND
EFFECTIVE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WE
WILL
PROHIBIT
IT
OUTRIGHT
AS
SOME
COUNTRIES
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
DONE
THEYLL
JUST
PROVIDE
AN
EASILYCOMPROMISED
VERSION
TO
JQ
PUBLIC
NOR
IS
THE
US
SAYING
THAT
EVERY
AMERICAN
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
IS
ENTITLED
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
MAYBE
WE
NEED
A
CRA
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
RIGHTS
AMENDMENT
THERE
IS
A
FALSE
TENSION
CREATED
IN
THE
ASSESSMENT
THAT
THIS
ISSUE
IS
AN
EITHEROR
PROPOSITION
RATHER
BOTH
CONCERNS
CAN
BE
AND
IN
FACT
ARE
HARMONIOUSLY
BALANCED
THROUGH
A
REASONED
BALANCED
APPROACH
SUCH
AS
IS
PROPOSED
WITH
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
SIMILAR
ENCRYPTION
TECHNIQUES
NICE
LULLABY
BUT
WHY
AM
I
NOT
SOOTHED
ALSO
IN

ARCLELANDSTANFORDEDU
ANDREW
RICHARD
CONWAY
WRITES
PS
I
CANT
WORK
OUT
WHY
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
DOESNT
WANT
TO
SELL
THEM
OVERSEAS
AFTER
ALL
THEY
ARE
RATHER
EASY
FOR
US
INTERESTS
TO
DECODE
SO
MAKE
A
PERFECT
TOOL
FOR
INDUSTRIALMILITARY
ESPIONAGELULLING
ANYONE
STUPID
ENOUGH
TO
BUY
IT
INTO
A
FALSE
SENSE
OF
SECURITY
YOU
WILL
NOTICE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
MENTION
ANYWHERE
ABOUT
SAFETY
FOR
NONAMERICANS
WHY
REPEAT
THEMSELVES
IT
APPEARS
TO
SOME
AND
THE
STORY
LOOKS
PRETTY
CONVINCING
TO
ME
TOO
THAT
THE
JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT
STOLE
A
CASETRACKING
SYSTEM
MODIFIED
IT
AND
DISTRIBUTED
IT
TO
FRIENDLY
POLICE
AND
SUCHLIKE
AGENCIES
AROUND
THE
WORLD
EG
THE
CANADIAN
MOUNTIES
OF
COURSE
I
HAVE
NO
DOUBT
THEY
SWORE
SCOUTS
HONOR
THAT
THERE
WERE
NO
BACKDOORS
WITH
THAT
KIND
