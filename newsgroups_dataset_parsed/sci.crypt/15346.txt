heres
a
simple
way
to
convert
the
clipper
proposal
to
an
unexceptionable
one
make
it
voluntary
that
isyou
get
high
quality
secure
nsa
classified
technology
if
you
agree
to
escrow
your
key
otherwise
you
are
on
your
own
as
long
as
you
are
on
your
own
means
that
you
can
use

if
high

secure
nsa
classified
technology
means
handing
my
key
over
to
whomever
ill
take
pgp
any
day
right
now
they
are
billing
it
as
voluntary
ie
bend
over
here
it
comes
as
soon
as
enough
wiretap
chip
based
units
are
out
there
how
much
easier
do
you
think
it
will
be
to
redefine
on
your
own
to
mean
write
it
yourself
and
dont
even
think
about
distributing
it
get
honest
no
one
is
going
to
buy
this
trash
if
they
know
its
compromised
already
and
less
will
buy
it
if
the
algorithm
is
not
disclosed
the
nsa
knows
that
making
this
stuff
available
to
the
public
means
handing
it
to
whatever
foreign
powers
are
interested
in
the
process
since
when
has
export
control
stopped
anyone
especially
software
wise
ask
yourself
carefully
if
high
quality
secure
nsa
classified
technology
is
something
they
are
going
to
hand
out
not
unless
you
