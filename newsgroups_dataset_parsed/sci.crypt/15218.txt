WRITES
I
SOMEHOW
STARTED
TO
DOUBT
TECHNICAL
COMPETENCE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DESIGNED
THE
SYSTEM
WHY
ON
THE
EARTH
SPLIT
THE
KEY
IN
PARTS
TO
KEEP
THEM
IN
ESCROW
SEPARATELY
HAVING
BIT
AND
LARGE
VOLUMES
OF
DATA
VOICE
LINKS
PRODUCE
IT
SHOULD
BE
RELATIVELY
EASY
TO
BREAK
IT
WHEN
THEY
SIMPLY
COULD
KEEP
SEQUENCES
IN
N
INDEPENDENT
PLACES
AND
THEN
XOR
ALL
THE
PARTIAL
KEYS
TO
GET
THE
ACTUAL
KEY
SEQUENCES
SHOULD
OBVIOUSLY
BE
SELECTED
RANDOMLY
AND
NTH
IS
THE
ACTUAL
KEY
XORED
WITH
THE
RANDOM
SEQUENCES
WITHOUT
REAL
TECHNICAL
DETAILS
ITS
HARD
TO
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION

SUPPOSE
THEY
ALREADY
ARE
XORING
THE
TWO
PARTS
TO
PRODUCE
ONLY
BITS
OF
REAL
KEY
MATERIAL
MAYBE
THEYRE
USING
THE
EXPORTABLE
VERSION
OF
PHIL
