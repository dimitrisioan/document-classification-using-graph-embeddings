ANDREW
RICHARD
CONWAY
WRITES
I
MUST
PROTEST
YOUR
IN
A
COMMUNIST
COUNTRY
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THERE
HAVENT
BEEN
ANY
AND
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
EVER
BE
ANY
IN
SOME
SOCIALIST
DICTATORSHIPS
YOU
CANT
WHILST
IN
SOME
SOCIALIST
DEMOCRACIES
SUCH
AS
FRANCE
OR
AUSTRALIA
YOU
CAN
OF
COURSE
SOME
PEOPLE
MAY
DISAGREE
ABOUT
FRANCE
AUSTRALIA
BEING
SOCIALIST
IT
OR
RATHER
YOURE
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
IT
AND
NOBODY
IS
SHOOTING
AT
US
YET
GUESS
WHAT
PEOPLE
YOU
LIVE
IN
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
COUNTRIES
IN
THE
WORLD
WHERE
A
PERSON
CAN
COMPLAIN
WITHOUT
GETTING
SHOT
AT
IN
SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
WAS
AT
A
PUBLIC
MEETING
LAST
NIGHT
IN
THE
USA
WHERE
A
PROTESTER
WHO
WAS
VERY
NICE
AND
CALM
AND
JUST
SAID
BEFORE
THE
SPEAKER
STARTED
TO
BEWARE
OF
HIS
OPINIONS
WAS
FORCED
OUT
OF
THE
MEETING
BY
TWO
ARMED
POLICEMEN
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
THINGS
THAT
ONE
CANNOT
DO
IN
THE
USA
YOU
MAY
NOT
NOTICE
THEM
BUT
AS
AN
AUSTRALIAN
VISITOR
I
NOTICE
THEM
OF
COURSE
DONT
OVER
REACT
BUT
DONT
UNDER
REACT
THANK
YOU
ANDREW
NOT
ONLY
FOR
THE
FIRM
REBUTTAL
BUT
FOR
UNDERSTANDING
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
COMMUNISM
AND
SOCIALISM
EVEN
THOUGH
THIS
IS
OFF
TOPIC
WHY
DO
PEOPLE
JUST
NOT
UNDERSTAND
THAT
JUST
BECAUSE
ALL
THOSE
PRETTY
SONGS
ABOUT
THE
LAND
OF
THE
FREE
AND
SO
ON
SOUND
NICE
THAT
THEY
MAY
NOT
BE
TRUE
TAKE
OFF
THOSE
ROSE
COLORED
GLASSES
AND
GET
A
CLUE
TO
USE
TWO
OF
THE
BETTER
CLICHES
AROUND
THANKS
YOU
AGAIN
JAMIE
