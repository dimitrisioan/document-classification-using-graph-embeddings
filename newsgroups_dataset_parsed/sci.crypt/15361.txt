LIKE
TO
ME
A
BUNCH
OF
WELLMEANING
MAYBE
CYNNICAL
TEXT
ABOUT
SCREWTHREAD
SIZES
THE
RIGHTS
OF
PEOPLE
TO
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
STANDARDS
AND
THE
NONRIGHT
OF
THE
GOV
TO
REGULATE
SCREWTHREADS
WELL
AS
FUNNY
AS
YOUR
LITTLE
COMMENT
MAY
SEEM
IT
HAS
VERY
LITTLE
TO
DO
WITH
YOUR
PERSONAL
PRIVACY
AS
A
CITIZEN
AND
ABOUT
THE
GOVERNEMNT
BEING
ABLE
TO
LOOK
AT
EVERYTHING
YOU
HAVE
EVER
TYPED
INTO
A
COMPUTER
AT
ONE
POINT
OR
ANOTHER
THIS

THAT
HAS
TO
BE
USED
BY
EVERYONE
AND
EVERYONES
PERSONAL
KEY
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
SEGMENTS
AND
STORED
AT
TWO
SEPARATE
ALBEIT
EASY
TO
FIND
PLACES
AND
THAT
KEY
IS
ONLY
BITS
TO

WITH
WE

ALREADY
HAVE
THE
CRACKING
CHIPS
FOR
THIS
CLIPPER
CHIP
MADE
HELL
THEY
PROBABLY
BASED
THE
ENCODER
ON
THE
CHIP
THAT
CRACKS
IT
THAT
WAY
ITS
EASIER
TO
BREAK
THE
CODE
BUT
SINCE
IT
IS
A
CLASSIFIED
ALGORYTHM
NO
ONE
KNOWS
THAT
THEY
CAN
CRACK
IT
SO
EASILY
I
FOR
ONE
AND
QUITE
SCARED
OF
THIS
KIND
OF

AND
PLAN
TO
SUPPORT
ORGANIZATIONS
AND
EVEN
DISORGANIZATIONS
WHO
ARE
FIGHTING
AGAINST
THIS
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
ANY
WAY
THAT
I
CAN
I
DO
NOT
WANT
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
ACCESS
EVEN
WITH
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
TO
MY
KEYS
AND
I
DONT
WANT
THOSE
