IM
SCARED
SHITLESS
OF
THE
FEDS
LISTENING
IN
ON
MY
CALLS
MY
OPINIONS
ARE
THE
SORT
THAT
WOULD
GET
ME
DISAPPEARED
IN
A
SLIGHTLY
LESS
FREE
SOCIETY
AND
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
SORT
OF
SOCIETY
WE
WILL
BE
IN
IN
FIVE
OR
TEN
YEARS
I
HAVE
FRIENDS
WHO
HAVE
HAD
THEIR
PHONES
TAPPED
NONE
OF
THIS
IS
THEORETICAL
TO
ME
I
UNDERSTAND
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
AND
THERE
ARE
ANY
NUMBER
OF
KINDS
OF
CONVERSATION
AND
COMMUNICATION
I
ENGAGE
IN
THAT
I
WOULDNT
EVEN
CONSIDER
USING
THIS
SCHEME
FOR
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
DONT
SEE
CLIPPER
AS
PROVIDING
A
SECURE
CHANNELIT
JUST
PREVENTS
CASUAL
EAVESDROPPING
THIS
IS
PART
OF
WHY
I
AM
NOT
WORRIED
ABOUT
IT
PER
SE
TRYING
TO
LOOK
AT
CLIPPER
AS
A
SERIOUS
SECURITY
TOOL
IS
SIMPLY
LUDICROUS
ITS
A
VOICE
SCRAMBLER
NOTHING
MORE
THERE
IS
STILL
PLENTY
OF
MARKET
FOR
REAL
CRYPTO
AS
FOR
ITS
BETTER
THAN
THE
STATUS
QUO
WELL
FIRST
OF
ALL
YOU
CAN
GET
A
CRYPTOPHONE
FROM
COMPANIES
LIKE
CYLINK
TODAY
AND
THEY
WORK
WELL
THEY
COST
AN
ARM
AND
A
LEG
THOUGH
CLIPPER
IS
OBVIOUSLY
AIMED
AT
THE
MASS
MARKET
IT
CERTAINLY
WONT
PUT
CYLINK
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
IN
ADDITION
A
NUMBER
OF
GROUPS
ARE
NOW
WORKING
ON
BUILDING
SOFTWARE
TO
TURN
ANY
PC
INTO
A
PRIVACY
ENHANCED
PHONE
RIGHT
NOW
AND
THEY
ARE
ALL
WORKING
IN
OVERDRIVE
MODE
THIS
IS
OLD
NEWS
I
CAN
DO
THIS
NOW
THERE
ARE
NO
CRYPTO
RESTRICTIONS
YET
YOU
CAN
USE
ANYTHING
YOU
WANT
RIGHT
NOW
THE
POINT
IS
TO
MAINTAIN
THAT
RIGHT
THERE
ARE
RESTRICTIONS
EXAMPLE
WERE

WITH
A

YOU
WANT

I
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WANT
STRONG
CRYPTO
PKCS
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
BE
THE
DEFAULT
FOR
ELECTRONIC

WORLDWIDE
I
WANT
PRIESTS

I
WANT

TO

OVER
THE
NET
I
WANT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO

TRANSACT
BUSINESS
AND
SO
ON
ELECTRONICALLY
THIS
IS
SO
FAR
INFEASIBLE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
CURRENT
RESTRICTIONS
ON
CRYTOGRAPHIC
SYSTEMS
ESPECIALLY
BEYOND
THE
BORDERS
OF
THE
USA
CLIPPER
IS
IRRELEVANT
AND
IF
IT
DISTRACTS
THE
AUTHORITIES
INTO
FEELING
SAFE
ALL
THE
BETTER
ITS
ONLY
DANGER
IS
IF
IT
EMBOLDENS
THEM
INTO
TRYING
TO
PUT
MORE
RESTRICTIONS
INTO
PLACE
ON
THE
THEORY
THAT
IT
IS
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
NOTHING
TO

THAT
ARGUMENT
IS
