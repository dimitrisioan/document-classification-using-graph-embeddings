ID
DESPARATELY
PREFER
IT
IF
WE
DIDNT
REHASH
THE
SAME
ARGUMENTS
THAT
WENT
ON
AD
INFINITUM
LAST
TIME
THATS
ESPECIALLY
TRUE
FOR
SCICRYPT
FOR
THAT
MATTER
IVE
CREATED
ALTPRIVACYCLIPPER
SINCE
THE
TRAFFIC
IS
APPEARING
IN
MANY
DIFFERENT
GROUPS
RIGHT
NOW
IM
GOING
TO
FOCUS
HERE
ON
SOME
TECHNICAL
ASPECTS
OF
THE
PLAN
HENCE
MY
FOLLOWUP
TO
SCICRYPT
FRANKLY
IF
YOURE
NOT
AN
ABSOLUTIST
YOUR
FEELINGS
MAY
TURN
ON
SOME
OF
THESE
ISSUES
FOR
EXAMPLE
WITH
AN
KEY
SIMPLY
SPLITTING
IT
INTO
TWO
PIECES
IS
MUCH
LESS
ACCEPTABLE
THAN
OTHER
SCHEMES
BECAUSE
IT
MEANS
THAT
IF
JUST
ONE
REPOSITORY
IS
SHALL
WE
SAY
OVERLY
PLIABLE
A
WOULDBE
EAVESDROPPER
WOULD
NEED
TO
RECOVER
JUST
MORE
BITS
OF
KEY
I
NEED
NOT
POINT
OUT
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
THAT
THATS
PRETTY
EASY
TO
DO
BY
EXHAUSTIVE
SEARCH
A
SLIGHTLY
MORE
COMPLEX
SCHEME
XORING
THE
KEY
WITH
A
RANDOM
NUMBER
AND
THEN
WITH
ITS
COMPLEMENT
WOULD
PRODUCE
TWO
SUBKEYS
NEITHER
OF
WHICH
IS
USEFUL
ALONE
THAT
VARIANT
IS
MUCH
MORE
RESISTANT
TO
ATTACK
CLEARLY
ONE
CAN
GET
EVEN
MORE
SOPHISTICATED
TO
PROTECT
THE
SUBKEYS
EVEN
MORE
OTHER
THOUGHTS
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
NOTED
THE
SIZE
AND
COMPLEXITY
OF
THE
DATABASES
NECESSARY
BUT
THE
ID
STRINGS
THE
PHONES
EMIT
COULD
BE
THEIR
BACK
DOOR
KEY
DOUBLEENCRYPTED
WITH
THE
ESCROW
REPOSITORIES
PUBLIC
KEYS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
THEY
COULD
DO
THAT
ONLY
WITH
SESSION
KEYS
AND
HAVE
NO
BACK
DOOR
AT
ALL
IN
THAT
CASE
THE
FBI
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BRING
EVERY
INTERCEPT
TO
THE
REPOSITORIES
TO
BE
DECRYPTED
THIS
WOULD
ANSWER
MANY
OF
THE
OBJECTIONS
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
HOW
DO
YOU
MAKE
SURE
THEY
STOP
WE
CAN
EVEN
COMBINE
THAT
WITH
A
VARIANT
OF
THE
DIGITAL
TELEPHONY
BACK
DOOR
HAVE
THE
SWITCH
DO
THE
TAP
BUT
WITH
A
DIGITALLYSIGNED
RECORD
OF
THE
TIME
PHONE
NUMBER
ETC
OF
THE
CALL
THAT
PROVIDES
PROOF
TO
THE
ESCROW
AGENTS
THAT
THE
TAP
WAS
DONE
IN
COMPLIANCE
WITH
THE
TERMS
OF
THE
WARRANT
I
CAN
SUGGEST
OTHER
VARIATIONS
TOO
SUPPOSE
EACH
CLIPPER
CHIP
HAD
PUBLIC
KEY
PAIRS
EACH
WOULD
BE
USED
TIMES
AFTER
WHICH
YOUD
NEED
MORE
KEYING
MATERIAL
NOT
A
BAD
IDEA
IN
ANY
EVENT
THIS
COULD
BE
USED
TO
ENFORCE
TIME
LIMITS
OR
RATHER
USAGE
LIMITS
ON
EACH
WARRANT
THE
KEYS
THE
REPOSITORY
AGENTS
WOULD
DELIVER
WOULDNT
LAST
FOR
VERY
LONG
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
ALGORITHM
ITSELF
IS
SECURE
APART
FROM
THE
OBVIOUS
WHY
PUSH
A
WEAK
ALGORITHM
WHEN
YOUVE
ALREADY
GOT
THE
BACK
DOOR
I
THINK
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
STILL
GENUINELY
CONCERNED
ABOUT
FOREIGN
ESPIONAGE
ESPECIALLY
AIMED
AT
COMMERCIAL
TARGETS
THIS
SCHEME
LETS
THE
SPOOKS
HAVE
THEIR
CAKE
AND
EAT
IT
TOO
IVE
HEARD
RUMORS
OVER
THE
YEARS
THAT
SOME
FACTIONS
WITHIN
NSA
WERE
UNHAPPY
WITH
DES
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
TOO
GOOD
NOT
THAT
THEY
COULDNT
CRACK
IT
BUT
IT
WAS
MUCH
TOO
EXPENSIVE
TO
DO
SO
AS
EASILY
AS
THEYD
WANT
THEYRE
KEEPING
THE
DETAILS
SECRET
SO
THAT
OTHERS
DONT
BUILD
THEIR
OWN
IMPLEMENTATIONS
WITHOUT
THE
BACK
DOOR
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
PROTOCOL
THOUGH
IS
ANOTHER
MATTER
I
SEE
NO
VALID
REASONS
FOR
KEEPING
IT
SECRET
AND
AS
I
HOPE
IVE
SHOWN
ABOVE
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
WAYS
TO
DO
THINGS
THAT
ARENT
QUITE
AS
BAD
