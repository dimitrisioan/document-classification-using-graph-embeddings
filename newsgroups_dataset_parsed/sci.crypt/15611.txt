etc
this
is
not
to
say
that
they
dont
they
might
but
you
dont
know
that
they
do
and
you
have
no
evidence
that
they
do
for
almost
all
values
of
you
it
follows
therefore
that
for
most
values
of
you
your
claims
about
the
nsa
border
on
paranoia
andrew
now
i
wouldnt
be
the
one
to
claim
that
you
are
injecting
some
disinformation
into
the
net
andrew
but
paranoia
refers
to
unwarranted
or
excessive
suspicions
or
fear
not
those
that
have
reasonable
roots
lets
start
with
looking
at
the
professionals
the
nsa
itself
its
birth
was
by
secret
executive
order
by
harry
s
truman
in
until
even
not
even
one
word
of
this
executive
order
chartering
the
nsa
was
sealed
paranoia
right
on
the
outside
of
the
nsa
complex
is
a
ten
foot
cyclone
fence
with
multiple
rows
of
barbed
wire
with
high
voltage
complete
with
signs
prohibiting
even
making
sketches
under
penalty
of
the
internal
security
act
the
area
is
completely
scanned
by
closed
circuit
television
more
paranoia
these
are
professionals
maybe
they
know
something
we
dont
eh
do
you
think
it
would
have
helped
admiral
yamamoto
if
the
japanese
had
been
a
little
more
paranoid
of
their
purple
cipher
or
maybe
the
germans
should
have
been
a
little
more
paranoid
about
their
engima
with
respect
to
turing
and
the
british
how
about
the
cracking
of
the
zimmerman
telegram
would
a
little
more
paranoia
have
helped
the
germans
here
maybe
the
nsa
should
have
been
a
little
more
paranoid
about
emma
woikin
or
joseph
sidney
petersen
jr
or
maybe
you
want
to
talk
about
macmillan
publishers
cooperation
with
the
cia
and
nsa
to
suppress
yardleys
japanese
diplomatic
secrets
or
even
kahns
the
codebreakers
paranoia
right
the
most
popular
cipher
systems
in
captured
soviet
spies
was
the
onetime
pad
even
with
the
necessity
of
keeping
incriminating
evidence
about
is
known
to
be
the
only
proven
unbreakable
system
soviet
paranoia
right
and
what
do
you
think
the
nsa
does
with
its
wullenwebers
and
huge
rhombics
pointed
embassy
row
and
their
sites
near
satellite
uplink
and
downlink
sites
duh
when
i
worked
in
a
classified
mitre
communications
lab
at
one
time
even
with
a
secret
clearance
i
had
to
be
escorted
to
the
toilet
and
the
entire
site
was
built
into
a
moslertype
vault
with
very
thick
bombproof
door
mitre
paranoia
i
could
cite
probably
a
hundred
more
facts
which
all
support
as
best
hypothesis
the
notion
that
the
nsa
is
grabbing
as
much
as
it
can
as
fast
as
it
can
one
would
be
a
fool
to
ignore
the
pattern
of
facts
and
conclude
that
they
were
random
and
we
know
the
government
is
violent
even
against
children
as
recent
events
prove
judge
william
sessions
is
a
disgrace
but
a
solemn
warning
to
those
who
ignore
the
web
of
evidence
that
our
government
institutions
have
in
their
contempt
for
our
civil
rights
and
of
course
we
have
to
err
somewhat
on
the
excessive
side
of
caution
because
that
does
much
less
harm
than
erring
on
the
reckless
side
as
member
of
the
crew
of
the
uss
liberty
might
aver
i
might
suggest
andrew
that
you
read
kahns
codebreakers
and
bamfords
puzzle
palace
and
come
back
with
some
more
facts
to
support
your
sheepish
acquiescence
to
authority
