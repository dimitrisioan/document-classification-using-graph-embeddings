writes
in
article
as
one
of
the
happily
sleeping
people
i
would
just
like
to
ask
this
arent
people
just
slightly
overreacting
to
this
or
are
we
all
of
a
sudden
going
to
draw
parallels
to
nazi
germany
and
communist
russia
yes
reasonable
parallels
though
i
dont
think
russia
ever
claimed
to
be
communist
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
yes
this
is
a
serious
problem
but
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
guess
what
were
doing
something
now
you
cant
do
in
a
communist
country
or
nazi
germany
were
complaining
about
i
must
protest
your
in
a
communist
country
how
do
you
know
there
havent
been
any
and
are
unlikely
to
ever
be
any
in
some
socialist
dictatorships
you
cant
whilst
in
some
socialist
democracies
such
as
france
or
australia
you
can
of
course
some
people
may
disagree
about
france
australia
being
socialist
it
or
rather
youre
complaining
about
it
and
nobody
is
shooting
at
us
yet
or
rather
if
theyre
shooting
at
me
they
have
real
bad
aim
guess
what
people
you
live
in
one
of
the
few
countries
in
the
world
where
a
person
can
complain
without
getting
shot
at
in
some
circumstances
i
was
at
a
public
meeting
last
night
in
the
usa
where
a
protester
who
was
very
nice
and
calm
and
just
said
before
the
speaker
started
to
beware
of
his
opinions
was
forced
out
of
the
meeting
by
two
armed
policemen
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
one
cannot
do
in
the
usa
you
may
not
notice
them
but
as
an
australian
visitor
i
notice
them
people
are
always
complaining
that
somebody
did
this
wrong
or
somebody
did
that
wrong
or
whatever
sit
down
and
figure
out
two
things
what
have
they
done
right
how
much
worse
can
it
get
and
youll
find
that
you
and
i
are
pretty
damn
lucky
yes
we
are
lucky
at
the
moment
i
hope
that
is
still
true
in
a
few
years
time
because
it
didnt
just
happenit
required
concious
effort
so
lets
talk
about
it
get
some
action
going
decide
whats
going
on
but
lets
not
overreact
of
course
dont
over
react
but
dont
under
react
