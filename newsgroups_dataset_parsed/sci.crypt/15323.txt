re
dont
fight
clipper
chip
subvert
or
replace
it
the
clipper
chip
is
just
the
culmination
of
dorthy
denning
et
all
but
lets
ignore
that
for
the
moment
the
fundamental
question
iscan
the
government
stop
me
from
using
encryption
ignoring
for
the
moment
the
question
of
patented
processes
such
as
public
keys
can
the
government
stop
me
from
using
an
encryption
process
if
the
answer
is
yes
then
what
freedom
we
have
in
this
country
is
truly
gone
and
its
time
to
get
out
the
guns
or
the
lawyers
depending
upon
which
causes
more
damage
and
to
whom
however
assuming
that
i
can
still
encrypt
things
as
i
please
who
cares
about
the
clipper
chip
as
far
as
im
concerned
a
phone
line
is
insecure
period
i
dont
care
if
they
encrypt
it
ways
from
sunday
if
i
didnt
do
the
encrypting
i
dont
trust
it
this
is
the
attitude
that
everyone
else
should
have
instead
of
worrying
about
a
clipper
chip
simply
connect
your
handset
to
your
computer
and
feed
the
voice
single
through
process
encrypt
and
transmit
over
the
phone
the
guy
on
the
other
hand
then
does
the
same
in
reverse
cant
work
you
say
no
standard
you
say
obviously
you
have
never
uses
pgp
anyone
who
expects
the
government
to
protect
their
freedoms
is
kidding
themselves
only
you
can
protect
your
own
freedoms
one
final
thought
addressed
to
eff
you
support
the
implementation
of
any
form
of
encryption
where
the
encryption
key
must
be
revealed
you
do
why
if
not
why
specific
actions
are
you
planning
to
take
to
either
support
or
stop
this
proposal
you
do
not
support
this
proposal
what
alternatives
do
you
offer
the
jester
proof
windows

it

it

it
