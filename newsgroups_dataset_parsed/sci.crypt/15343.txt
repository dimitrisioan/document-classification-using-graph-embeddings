clipper
chip
technical
details
short
summary
of
what
bellovin
says
hellman
says
the
nsa
says
there
is
a
global
key
g
plus
one
key
uc
for
each
chip
c
the
user
can
choose
a
new
session
key
kp
for
each
phone
call
p
he
makes
chip
c
knows
three
keys
g
its
own
uc
and
the
users
kp
the
government
as
a
whole
knows
g
and
every
uc
apparently
a
message
m
is
encrypted
as
egeuckpc
ekpm
thats
it
the
system
as
described
here
cant
possibly
work
what
happens
when
someone
plugs
the
above
ciphertext
into
a
receiving
chip
to
get
m
the
receiving
chip
needs
kp
to
get
kp
the
receiving
chip
needs
uc
the
only
information
it
can
work
with
is
c
if
uc
can
be
computed
from
c
then
the
system
is
cryptographically
useless
and
the
key
escrow
is
bullshit
otherwise
how
is
a
message
decrypted
dan
