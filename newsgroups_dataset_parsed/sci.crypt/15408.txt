TEXT
OF
WHITE
HOUSE
ANNOUNCEMENT
AND
QAS
ON
CLIPPER
CHIP
ENCRYPTION
ROBERT
WARD
WRITES
AND
SINCE
THE
US
CONSTITUTIONS
GUARANTEES
THE
RIGHT
TO
EVERY
AMERICAN
TO
BEAR
ARMS
WHY
IS
NOT
EVERY
AMERICAN
ENTITLED
AS
A
MATTER
OF
HAVE
YOU
READ
THE
APPLICABLE
PART
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
INTERPRETED
IT
IN
CONTEXT
YES
BTW
THE
APPROPRIATE
AMENDMENTS
WERE
POSTED
HERE
SOME
TIME
AGO
IF
NOT
PLEASE
DO
SO
BEFORE
POSTING
THIS
MISINTERPRETATION
AGAIN
IT
REFERS
TO
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
TO
ORGANIZE
A
MILITIA
NOT
FOR
INDIVIDUAL
TO
CARRY
HANDGUNS
GRENADES
AND
ASSAULT
RIFLES
ITS
OK
ITS
OK
JUST
A
MONTH
AGO
I
EXPRESSED
MY
BELIEF
THAT
THE
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
A
MEANS
TO
SHOOT
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
IS
NOT
THAT
MUCH
NECESSARY
TO
ENSURE
A
PEOPLES
RIGHT
TO
BE
FREE
AND
GOT
FLAMED
BY
LOTS
OF
AMERICAN
GUN
SUPPORTERS
SO
I
THOUGHT
THAT
NEVER
MIND
THE
NEW
CRIPPLE
CHIP
IS
A
PURELY
AMERICAN
PROBLEM
SO
DEAL
WITH
THE
MESS
YOURSELVES
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
SHARE
WITH
YOU
A
BIT
OF
MY
EXPERIENCE
OF
LIVING
YEARS
UNDER
A
TOTALITARIAN
REGIME
IM
BULGARIAN
BECAUSE
I
THOUGHT
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
USEFUL
TO
YOU
OH
WELL
