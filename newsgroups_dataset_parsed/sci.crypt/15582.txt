STEVE
SIMMONS
WRITES
NORMALLY
ID
BE
THE
LAST
TO
ARGUE
WITH
STEVE
BUT
SHOULDNT
THAT
READ
YEARS
FOR
ALL
SOLUTIONS
I
MEAN
IF
WE
CAN
IMAGINE
THE
MACHINE
THAT
DOES
TRIALNANOSECOND
WE
CAN
IMAGINE
THE
STORAGE
MEDIUM
THAT
COULD
INDEX
AND
ARCHIVE
IT
HMMMM
I
THINK
WITH
REALLY
LARGE
KEYSPACES
LIKE
THIS
YOU
NEED
TO
ALTER
THE
STRATEGY
DISCUSSED
FOR
DES
ATTEMPT
DECRYPTION
OF
SEVERAL
BLOCKS
AND
CHECK
THE
DISCTRIBUTION
OF
THE
CONTENTS
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
AT
ALL
FEASIBLE
TO
KEEP
ENCRYPTIONS
OF
A
KNOWN
PLAINTEXT
BLOCK
ON
ANY
AMOUNT
OF
TAPE
OR
CDROM
AND
CERTAINLY
NOT
SUCH
ENCRYPTED
BLOCKS
ANYONE
KNOW
A
CHEAP
WAY
OF
CONVERTING
EVERY
ATOM
IN
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
INTO
A
ONE
BIT
STORAGE
DEVICE
ACTUALLY
A
KEYSEARCH
OF
THIS
KIND
SHOULDNT
BE
MUCH
WORSE
THAN
THE
SIMPLER
KIND
IN
TERMS
OF
SPEED
ITS
JUST
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IT
OVER
FOR
EVERY
ENCRYPTED
MESSAGE
DUMB
QUESTION
HAS
ANYONE
EVER
DONE
ANY
SERIOUS
RESEARCH
ON
HOW
MANY
LEGITIMATE
ASCIIENCODED
BLOCKS
THERE
ARE
THAT
COULD
BE
PART
OF
AN
ENGLISH
SENTENCE
FOR
ATTACKING
DES
IN
ECB
MODE
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
A
DICTIONARY
OF
THIS
KIND
MIGHT
BE
PRETTY
VALUABLE
