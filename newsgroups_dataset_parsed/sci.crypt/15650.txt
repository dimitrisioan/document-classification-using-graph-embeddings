lets
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
system
really
is
secure
unless
you
get
both
halves
of
the
encryption
key
from
the
two
independent
escrow
houses
lets
say
you
even
trust
the
escrow
houses
one
is
the
aclu
and
the
other
is
the
eff
and
im
not
entirely
joking
about
those
two
names
the
problem
with
lets
assume
reasoning
is
that
taken
to
the
extreme
and
youre
close
you
arrive
at
lets
assume
this
is
perfectly
ok
the
assumptions
you
make
are
big
ones
if
the
system
is
really
secure
then
why
does
the
government
have
to
keep
the
algorithm
secret
there
are
plenty
of
encryption
algorithms
that
dont
depend
upon
nondisclosure
to
be
secure
so
why
in
the
world
use
one
that
does
there
are
reasons
of
course
but
i
certainly
cant
think
of
any
honest
ones
next
you
assume
we
can
trust
the
escrow
houses
but
the
last
time
i
checked
every
single
branch
of
government
has
experienced
unauthorized
disclosure
corruption
and
even
fabrication
of
supposedly
secure
data
the
govt
is
saying
yeah
but
now
were
serious
so
you
can
trust
us
bullcrypt
and
finally
although
you
didnt
state
it
explicitly
you
implicitly
assume
that
the
warrant
mechanism
in
this
country
is
safe
and
reasonable
the
case
in
ventura
county
of
a
man
shot
and
killed
by
officers
serving
a
deliberately
fraudulant
warrant
tells
me
that
the
govt
has
a
long
ways
to
go
on
this
score
remember
that
all
this
is
to
catch
the
drug
dealers
right
as
others
have
pointed
out
the
current
proposal
will
if
deployed
render
truly
secure
encryption
much
more
expensive
and
inconvenient
than
uncle
sams
brand
who
will
be
able
to
afford
and
be
sufficiently
motivated
to
purchase
this
expensive
inconvenient
higher
protection
somebody
with
lots
of
extra
cash
the
following
is
more
true
than
ever
when
strong
encryption
is
outlawed
only
outlaws
will
have
strong
encryption
