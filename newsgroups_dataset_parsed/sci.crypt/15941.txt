how
to
escrow
if
escrowing
were
ok
there
is
a
description
of
something
called
a
fair
crypto
system
in
the
may
issue
of
byte
p
attributed
to
mit
professor
silvio
micali
the
way
it
works
is
as
follows
you
generate
your
private
key
s
and
break
it
up
into
pieces
and
such
that
mod
p
s
you
give
each
piece
etc
to
a
different
escrow
agency
the
agencies
each
compute
gsn
mod
p
and
forward
the
result
to
the
public
key
telephone
book
keeper
the
public
key
telephone
book
keeper
multiplies
all
the
gsn
mod
p
reduces
the
result
to
mod
p
and
this
will
be
the
users
public
key
now
if
there
were
several
hundered
recognized
escrow
agencies
and
the
user
could
give
a
piece
of
the
key
to
each
of
the
ones
he
trusted
the
result
would
be
something
of
an
improvement
over
the
proposed
clipper
system
i
still
dont
think
key
escrow
is
a
good
idea
for
both
philosophical
and
security
reasons
but
i
do
offer
this
suggestion
simply
to
determine
whether
escrow
advocates
are
at
all
interested
in
considering
alternatives
in
good
faith
or
whether
the
goal
is
to
insure
the
use
of
only
two
agencies
selected
for
spinelessness
in
the
face
of
official
requests
