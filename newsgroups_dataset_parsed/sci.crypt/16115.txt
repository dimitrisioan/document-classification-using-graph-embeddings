RE
SUBLIMINAL
CHANNELS
IN
DSS
MAY
I
SUGGEST
THAT
ANY
ANY
PROPOSED
CIPHER
SYSTEM
HAVING
LESS
ENTROPY
THAN
THE
USERS
KEY
AND
MESSAGE
CAN
HAVE
AN
EMBEDDED
SUBLIMINAL
CHANNEL
AS
BIG
AS
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
ENTROPIES
BETWEEN
THE
ENTROPY
OF
THE
USER
INPUT
MESSAGE
AND
THE
ENTROPY
OF
THE
OUTPUT
FOR
EXAMPLE
TAKE
PLAIN
DES
THE
UNSUSPECTING
USER
INPUTS
A
STRING
PLAINTEXT
TO
BE
ENCIPHERED
HE
CRANKS
THE
ALGORITHM
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
HACKED
BY
GEORGE
QUISLING
AND
COMES
OUT
WITH
NINE
CHAR
IN
AND
NINE
CHARS
OUT
RIGHT
THE
UNSEPECTING
USER
SHIPS
THE
CIPHERTEXT
TO
BE
DECRPYTED
AND
THE
MESSAGE
PLAINTEXT
IS
PRODUCED
EVERYTHING
FINE
RIGHT
NOPE
IMAGINE
THE
ALGORITHM
DID
A
LZ
COMPRESSION
ON
PLAINTEXT
BEFORE
DESING
COMPRESSING
IS
DOWN
TO
FOUR
CHARACTERS
WITH
MORE
ENTROPY
THE
OPPONENT
NOW
PADS
THE
MESSAGE
WITH
HIS
OWN
MESSAGE
ALSO
COMPRESSED
BEFORE
APPLYING
DES
TO
THE
CONCATENATED
COMPRESSED
PAIRS
WHEN
DECRPYTED
THE
FIRST
COMPRESSED
MESSAGE
IS
STRIPPED
OFF
AND
DECLARED
SENT
UNBEKNOWST
TO
THE
RECEIVER
THE
OPPONENTS
ACCOMPLICE
COLLECTS
THE
REMAINING
MESSAGE
IN
THE
BIT
BUCKET
AND
UNCOMPRESSES
TO
KILL
NOW
AND
TO
PREVENT
ALL
SUCH
SUBLIMINAL
OR
COVERT
STORAGE
CHANNELS
YOU
WOULD
NEED
TO
HAVE
MAXIMAL
ENTROPY
ALL
THE
TIME
WHICH
IS
A
PRIORI
IMPOSSIBLE
BECAUSE
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
STEREOTYPICAL
MESSAGE
MIGHT
BE
REPLACED
BY
ONE
BIT
IN
THE
OUTPUT
RESERVING
THE
REST
OF
THE
OUTPUT
BITS
FOR
THE
LONG
COVERT
MESSAGE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
YOU
OPPONENT
GET
TO
MUCK
WITH
THE
ALGORITHM
YOU
EITHER
HAVE
GOT
TO
MUCK
WITH
IT
LAST
OR
CONCEDE
HIS
POSSIBLE
EMBEDDING
OF
COVERT
CHANNELS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
YOU
PRESENT
A
MESSAGE
TO
AN
OPPONET
WITH
LESS
THAN
MAXIMAL
ENTROPY
THEN
YOU
HAVE
GIVEN
HIM
FREE
BITS
OF
STORAGE
