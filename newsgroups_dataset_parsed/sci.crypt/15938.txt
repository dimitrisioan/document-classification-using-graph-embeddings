what

could
i
get
into
if
i
ignored
the

and
sold
my

to
international
customers
anyway
im
not
sure
it
has
been
established
that
the
government
can
prevent
you
from
sending
an
algorithm
abroad
the
nsa
seems
to
have
won
by
intimidation
so
far
why
dont
you
try
it
of
course
you
could
just
distribute
your
algorithm
widely
for
free
and
screw
them
up
big
time
that
would
be
my
approach
