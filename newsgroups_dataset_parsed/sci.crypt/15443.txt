HOLLAND
WRITES
LET
ME
ASK
YOU
THIS
WOULD
YOU
TRUST
RICHARD
NIXON
WITH
YOUR
CRYPTO
KEYS
I
WOULDNT
I
TAKE
IT
YOU
MEAN
PRESIDENT
NIXON
NOT
PRIVATE
CITIZEN
NIXON
SURE
NOTHING
IM
DOING
WOULD
BE
OF
THE
SLIGHTEST
INTEREST
TO
PRESIDENT
NIXON
I
AM
SURE
YOU
DIDNT
MISS
THE
IMPLICATION
THAT
WE
COULD
HAVE
ANOTHER
RICHARD
NIXON
TYPE
PRESIDENT
IN
THE
FUTURE
PERHAPS
NOT
TOO
DISTANT
FUTURE
ACUTALLY
WITH
THAT
IN
MIND
THEN
I
TAKE
IT
YOU
ALSO
WOULD
NOT
OBJECT
TO
THE
GOV
COMING
UP
WITH
A
DECISION
NOT
PROPOSAL
JUST
LIKE
CLINTON
CRIPPLE
IS
A
DECISION
NOT
A
PROPOSAL
SPRUNG
ON
US
TO
START
PLACING
VIDEO
CAMERAS
WITH
SOUND
IN
EVERY
ROOM
OF
YOUR
HOUSE
WHICH
COULD
BE
ACTIVATED
WITHOUT
YOUR
KNOWLEGE
THEY
WOULD
BE
WELL
CONCEALED
SO
YOU
WOULDNT
KNOW
THE
LOCATION
TO
PREVENT
YOU
FROM
COVERING
THE
LENS
OPENING
AFTER
ALL
NOTHING
YOURE
DOING
WOULD
BE
OF
THE
SLIGHTEST
INTEREST
TO
A
GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL
RIGHT
SO
YOU
SURELY
SHOULD
NOT
OBJECT
TO
SUCH
A
PROPOSAL
NOT
THE
BEST
ANOLOGY
BUT
THE
PRINCIPLE
IS
PRETTY
CLOSE
THE
ABILITY
TO
EAVESDROP
ON
YOUR
ACTIVITY
WITH
LITTLE
OR
NO
EFFORT
WITHOUT
YOUR
KNOWLEGE
PROTECTED
BY
ENTIRELY
BY
GOVERNMENT
SAFEGUARDS
YOU
CAN
STILL
DRAW
YOUR
CURTAINS
SO
YOU
CAN
STILL
HAVE
YOUR
PRIVACY
FROM
EVERYONE
ELSE
EXCEPT
BIG
BROTHER
AFTER
ALL
WE
NEED
THIS
FOR
PROTECTION
FROM
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
TERRORISTS
AND
OTHER
CRIMINALS
LIKE
ENEMIES
OF
THE
STATE
AND
YOU
DONT
REALLY
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
UNBREAKABLE
PRIVACY
ANYWAY
SORT
OF
AS
THE
PRESS
RELEASE
OF
THE
CLINTON
CRIPPLE
DECISION
PUTS
IT
I
FIND
IT
CURIOUS
THEY
USE
THE
WORD
UNBREAKABLE
WHEN
THE
TERM
REALLY
SHOULD
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
BREAK
WITHOUT
PROPER
AUTHORIZATION
WHICH
THE
GOVERNMENT
MOST
CERTAINLY
HAS
AT
THEIR
DISPOSAL
RIGHT
THEY
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BREAK
IT
ILLEGALLY
WOULD
THEY
NAWWW
NOT
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
CLINTON
CAN
YOU
WHILE
MY
MIND
IS
ON
IT
GIVE
US
ONE
GOOD
REASON
THAT
THE
ALGORITHM
SHOULD
BE
A
SECRET
ALGORITHM
UNLESS
THIS
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
EITHER
IS
A
JOKE
OR
CONTAINS
FEATURES
LIKE
A
MASTER
KEY
OR
OTHER
BACK
DOOR
FOR
UNAUTHORIZED
EAVESDROPPING
IF
IT
WAS
REALLY
EVEN
MODERATELY
SECURE
AND
THE
GOVERNMENT
REALLY
MEANT
TO
REQUIRE
THE
PROPER
COURT
ORDER
AND
THE
KEYS
THAT
ARE
IN
THE
ESCROW
ACCOUNTS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DECIPHER
THE
TRAFFIC
WHAT
IS
THE
NEED
TO
KEEP
THE
ALGORITHM
SECRET
SEEMS
I
HEAR
RATHER
OFTEN
THAT
IF
AN
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
REQUIRES
THE
ALGORITHM
TO
REMAIN
A
SECRET
TO
BE
EFFECTIVE
IT
IS
NOT
A
WORTHWHILE
SCHEME
IS
THIS
JUST
IDLE
TALK
OR
IS
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BULLSHITTING
EVERYONE
WITH
GREAT
SKEPTICISM
AND
MANY
DOUBTS
ON
OUR
ADMINISTRATIONS
INTENTIONS
AND
WAIT
WE
HAVENT
BEEN
TOLD
THE
NEXT
GEM
THE
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
IN
MIND
FOR
EMAIL
AND
DATAFILE
SECURITY
THE
PRESS
RELEASE
DOES
SAY
THAT
THIS
IS
PART
OF
A
COMPREHENSIVE
THING
ON
DATA
SECURITY
FOR
US
UNPRIVILEGED
CITIZENS
PERHAPS
SUBJECTS
WOULD
BE
THE
BETTER
TERM

SOMEHOW
DOES
NOT
SEEM
APPROPRIATE
THAT
IMPLIES

SUBJECTS

THE
PLEASURE
OF
THEIR

THE

NO
