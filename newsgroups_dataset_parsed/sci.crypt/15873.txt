SCOTTMIMICROSOFTCOM
SCOTT
MILLER
TECHCOM
WRITES
STIKES
ME
THAT
ALL
THIS
CONCERN
OVER
THE
GOVERNMENTS
ABILITY
TO
EAVESDROP
IS
A
LITTLE
OVERBLOWN
WHAT
CANT
THEY
DO
TODAY
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THAT
THEY
ALREADY
CAN
TAP
LISTEN
GET
ACCESS
EXC
TO
OUR
PHONE
LINES
BANK
RECORDS
ETC
ETC
AGAIN
WELL
THEY
CANT
LISTEN
IN
ON
MUCH
OF
MINE
SINCE
I
ALREADY
USE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
FOR
MUCH
OF
MY
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
AND
WILL
START
USING
IT
FOR
MY
TELEPHONY
AS
SOON
AS
PRACTICAL
HOWEVER
ALLOW
ME
TO
TELL
A
PARABLE
THERE
WAS
ONCE
A
FAR
AWAY
LAND
CALLED
RURITANIA
AND
IN
RURITANIA
THERE
WAS
A
STRANGE
PHENONMENON
ALL
THE
TREES
THAT
GREW
IN
RURITAINIA
WERE
TRANSPARENT
NOW
IN
THE
DAYS
WHEN
PEOPLE
HAD
LIVED
IN
MUD
HUTS
THIS
HAD
NOT
BEEN
A
PROBLEM
BUT
NOW
HIGHTECH
WOOD
TECHNOLOGY
HAD
BEEN
DEVELOPED
AND
IN
THE
NEW
AGE
OF
WOOD
EVERYONE
IN
RURITANIA
FOUND
THAT
THEIR
HOMES
WERE
ALL
SEE
THROUGH
NOW
UNTIL
THIS
POINT
NO
ONE
EVER
THOUGHT
OF
ALLOWING
THE
POLICE
TO
SPY
ON
SOMEONES
HOME
BUT
THE
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
MADE
THIS
TEMPTING
THIS
BEING
A
CIVILIZED
COUNTRY
HOWEVER
WARRANTS
WERE
REQUIRED
TO
USE
BINOCULARS
AND
WATCH
SOMEONE
IN
THEIR
HOME
THE
POLICE
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
THIS
WOULD
GET
WARRANTS
TO
USE
BINOCULARS
AND
PEER
IN
TO
SEE
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
OCCASSIONALLY
THEY
WOULD
USE
BINOCULARS
WITHOUT
A
WARRANT
BUT
EVERYONE
PRETENDED
THAT
THIS
DIDNT
HAPPEN
ONE
DAY
A
SMART
MAN
INVENTED
PAINT
AND
IF
YOU
PAINTED
YOUR
HOUSE
SUDDENLY
THE
POLICE
COULDNT
WATCH
ALL
YOUR
ACTIONS
AT
WILL
THINGS
WOULD
GO
BACK
TO
THE
WAY
THEY
WERE
IN
THE
OLD
AGE
COMPLETELY
PRIVATE
INDIGNANT
THE
STATE
DECIDED
TO
TRY
TO
REQUIRE
THAT
ALL
HOMES
HAVE
VIDEO
CAMERAS
INSTALLED
IN
EVERY
NOOK
AND
CRANNY
AFTER
ALL
THEY
SAID
WITH
THIS
NEW
DEVELOPMENT
CRIME
COULD
RUN
RAMPANT
INSTALLING
VIDEO
CAMERAS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
THE
POLICE
GET
ANY
NEW
CAPABILITY
THEY
ARE
JUST
KEEPING
THE
OLD
ONE
A
WISE
MAN
POINTED
OUT
THAT
CITIZENS
WERE
NOT
OBLIGATED
TO
MAKE
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
POLICE
EASY
THAT
THE
POLICE
HAD
SURVIVED
ALL
THROUGH
THE
MUD
HUT
AGE
WITHOUT
BEING
ABLE
TO
WATCH
THE
CITIZENS
AT
WILL
AND
THAT
RURITANIA
WAS
A
CIVILIZED
COUNTRY
WHERE
NOT
EVERYTHING
THAT
WAS
EXPEDIENT
WAS
PERMITTED
FOR
INSTANCE
IN
A
NEIGHBORING
COUNTRY
IT
HAD
BEEN
DISCOVERED
THAT
TORTURE
WAS
AN
EXTREMELY
EFFECTIVE
WAY
TO
SOLVE
CRIMES
RURITANIA
HAD
BANNED
THIS
PRACTICE
IN
SPITE
OF
ITS
EXPEDIENCE
INDEED
WHY
HAVE
WARRANTS
AT
ALL
HE
ASKED
IF
WE
ARE
INTERESTED
ONLY
IN
EXPEDIENCE
A
FAMOUS
PAINT
TECHNOLOGIST
DOROTHY
QUISLING
INTERVENED
HOWEVER
SHE
NOTED
THAT
PEOPLE
MIGHT
TAKE
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
CHILDREN
MASTURBATING
SHOULD
THE
NEW
PAINT
TECHNOLOGY
BE
WIDELY
DEPLOYED
WITHOUT
SAFEGUARDS
AND
THE
LAW
WAS
PASSED
SOON
IT
WAS
DISCOVERED
THAT
SOME
CITIZENS
WOULD
COVER
THEIR
MOUTHS
WHILE
SPEAKING
TO
EACH
OTHER
THUS
PREVENTING
THE
POLICE
FROM
READING
THEIR
LIPS
THROUGH
THE
VIDEO
CAMERAS
THIS
HAD
TO
BE
PREVENTED
THE
POLICE
SAID
AFTER
ALL
IT
WAS
PREVENTING
THEM
FROM
CONDUCTING
THEIR
LAWFUL
SURVEILANCE
THE
WISE
MAN
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THE
POLICE
HAD
NEVER
BEFORE
BEEN
ALLOWED
TO
LISTEN
IN
ON
PEOPLES
HOMES
BUT
DOROTHY
QUISLING
POINTED
OUT
THAT
PEOPLE
MIGHT
USE
THIS
NEW
INVENTION
OF
COVERING
THEIR
MOUTHS
WITH
VEILS
TO
DISCUSS
THE
KIDNAPPING
AND
MUTILATION
OF
CHILDREN
NO
ONE
IN
THE
LEGISLATURE
WANTED
TO
BE
ACCUSED
OF
BEING
IN
FAVOR
OF
MUTILATING
CHILDREN
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
NO
ONE
WANTED
TO
INTERFERE
IN
PEOPLES
RIGHTS
TO
WEAR
WHAT
THEY
LIKED
SO
A
COMPROMISE
WAS
REACHED
WHEREBY
ALL
HOMES
WERE
INSTALLED
WITH
MICROPHONES
IN
EACH
ROOM
TO
ACCOMPANY
THE
VIDEO
CAMERAS
THE
WISE
MAN
LAMENTED
FEW
IF
ANY
CHILD
MUTILATIONS
HAD
EVER
BEEN
SOLVED
BY
THE
OLD
LIP
READING
TECHNOLOGY
BUT
IT
WAS
TOO
LATE
THE
MICROPHONES
WERE
INSTALLED
EVERWHERE
HOWEVER
IT
WAS
DISCOVERED
THAT
THIS
WAS
INSUFFICIENT
TO
PREVENT
CITIZENS
FROM
HIDING
INFORMATION
FROM
THE
AUTHORITIES
BECAUSE
SOME
OF
THEM
WOULD
CLEVERLY
SPEAK
IN
LANGUAGES
THAT
THE
POLICE
COULD
NOT
UNDERSTAND
A
NEW
LAW
WAS
PROPOSED
TO
FORCE
ALL
CITIZENS
TO
SPEAK
AT
ALL
TIMES
ONLY
IN
RURITANIAN
AND
FOR
GOOD
MEASURE
TO
REQUIRE
THAT
THEY
SPEAK
CLEARLY
AND
DISTINCTLY
NEAR
THE
MICROPHONES
AFTER
ALL
DOROTHY
QUISLING
POINTED
OUT
THEY
MIGHT
BE
USING
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
SPEAK
IN
PRIVATE
TO
MASK
TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES
TERRORISM
STRUCK
TERROR
INTO
EVERYONES
HEARTS
AND
THEY
REJOICED
AT
THE
BRULLIANCE
OF
THIS
NEW
LAW
MEANWHILE
THE
WISE
MAN
TALKED
ONE
EVENING
TO
HIS
FRIENDS
ON
HOW
ALL
OF
THIS
WAS
MAKING
A
SHAM
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
OF
RURITANIA
OF
WHICH
ALL
RURITANIANS
WERE
PROUD
WHY
HE
ASKED
ARE
WE
OBLIGATED
TO
SACRIFICE
ALL
OUR
FREEDOM
AND
PRIVACY
TO
MAKE
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
POLICE
EASIER
THERE
ISNT
ANY
REAL
EVIDENCE
THAT
THIS
MAKES
ANY
BIG
DENT
IN
CRIME
ANYWAY
ALL
IT
DOES
IS
MAKE
OUR
PRIVACY
FORFEIT
TO
THE
STATE
HOWEVER
THE
WISE
MAN
MADE
THE
MISTAKE
OF
SAYING
THIS
AS
THE
LAW
REQUIRED
IN
RURITANIAN
CLEARLY
AND
DISTINCTLY
AND
NEAR
A
MICROPHONE
SOON
THE
NEWLY
FORMED
RURITANIAN
SECRET
POLICE
ARRIVED
AND
TOOK
HIM
OFF
AND
GOT
HIM
TO
CONFESS
BY
TORTURING
HIM
TORTURE
WAS
AFTER
ALL
FAR
MORE
EFFICIENT
THAN
THE
OLD
METHODS
AND
HAD
BEEN
RECENTLY
INSTITUTED
TO
STOP
THE
RECENT
WAVE
OF
PEOPLE
THINKING
OBSCENE
THOUGHTS
ABOUT
TOMATOES
WHICH
DOROTHY
QUISLING
NOTED
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
MAJOR
PROBLEMS

THE
