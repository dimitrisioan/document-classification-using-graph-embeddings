YOU
DONT

ARE
BEING
LIED
TO
FOOLED
INTO
BELIEVING
THE
CHIP
GIVES
PRIVACY
WHEN
IT
FACT
IT
ALLOWS
WIRETAPS
IT
DOES
GIVE
PRIVACY
JUST
NOT
ABSOLUTE
PRIVACY
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS
VERY
UP
FRONT
ABOUT
THIS
AND
ABOUT
ALLOWING
WIRETAPS
HOW
IS
THIS
FOOLING
ANYONE
ARE
YOU
SO
SMART
THAT
YOU
KNOW
WHEN
YOURE
TALKING
TO
SOMEBODY
WHO
HAS
A
WIRETAP
CHIP
ON
THEIR
PHONE
INSTEAD
OF
A
PRIVACY
CHIP
WITH
PRIVATE
KEYS
SURE
THE
TWO
DONT
INTEROPERATE
YOU
COULDNT
TALK

I
WOULD
EXPECT
EVEN
MULTIPROTOCAL
PHONES
TO
COME
WITH
INDICATORS
SAYING
WHICH
KIND
OF

ENCRYPTION
IS
IN
USE
WE
DO
NEED
AN

TO
NSABUGGED
TELEPHONES
BUT
WERE
TALKING
INEXPENSIVE
TELEPHONES
HERE
INCLUDING
HANDSIZED
CELLULARS
THAT
NEED
STRONG
CRYPTO
REAL
PRIVACY
SO
START
A
COMPANY
AND
BUILD
THEM
THIS
IS
STILL
MOSTLY
A
CAPITALIST
ECONOMY
WHAT
WE
NEED
IS
A
TRUE
PRIVACY
CHIP
