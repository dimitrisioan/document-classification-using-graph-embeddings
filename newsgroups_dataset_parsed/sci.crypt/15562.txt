ACTUALLY
I
AM
COMPLETELY
BAFFLED
BY
WHY
DOROTHY
DENNING
HAS
CHOSEN
TO
THROW
AWAY
HER
ACADEMIC
RESPECTABILITY
LIKE
THIS
ACTUALLY
IVE
BEEN
FOLLOWING
HER
REMARKS
FOR
SOME
TIME
WITH
INTEREST
IM
ALSO
A
MEMBER
OF
ACADEMIA
AND
HER
REMARKS
HAVE
NOTHING
BUT
ELEVATE
HER
RESPECTABILITY
IN
MY
EYES
IT
REMAINS
TO
BE
SEEN
WHETHER
YOU
ARE
THE
RADICAL
FRINGE
OR
I
IT
IS
GENERALLY
AN
ERROR
TO
ASSUME
THAT
YOUR
BELIEFS
ARE
HELD
BY
THE
MAJORITY
OR

ARE
CLEARLY
A
SPECIAL
BUNCH
WE
LIVE
THE
NET
WHICH
IS
THE
FUTURE
OF
OUR
CULTURE
USENETTERS
HAVE
RAPID
ELECTRONIC
ACCESS
TO

SOCIETY
IN
GENERAL
MUST
DEPEND
ON
CNN
I
CAN
ONLY
HOPE
WE
CAN
MAKE
THIS
INFORMATION
ACCESSABLE
BY
THE
PUBLIC
BEFORE
THE
RADICAL
FRINGE
WHICH
IS
THE
MAJORITY
DESTROYS
THE
FABRIC
OF

FREEDOM
IS
NEVER
