HAN
WRITES
CAN
PEOPLE
WORK
WITHIN
THE
SYSTEM
BEFORE
TRYING
TO
BREAK
IT
EXAMINE
YOUR
HISTORY
BOOKS
AND
FIND
OUT
HOW
MANY
ARMED
REVOLUTIONS
LED
TO
DEMOCRATIC
OR
DEMOCRATIC
STYLE
GOVERNMENTS
I
THINK
YOULL
ONLY
FIND
ONE
IN
OVER
FIVE
THOUSAND
YEARS
OF
WRITTEN
HISTORY
THATS
NOT
VERY
GOOD
ODDS
I
MAY
BE
MISREADING
YOU
HERE
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THE
AMERICAN
REVOLUTION
WASNT
A
GOOD
IDEA
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
BAD
ODDS
I
KIND
OF
DOUBT
THAT
ANY
REVOLUTION
ARMED
OR
OTHERWISE
WAS
EVER
STARTED
WITHOUT
VAST
AMOUNTS
OF
FAILED
WORKING
WITHIN
A
SYSTEM
A
GOOD
SIGN
OF
A
SYSTEM
BEING
NOT
WORTH
PRESERVING
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
THAT
VERY
INABILITY
TO
WORK
WITHIN
IT
PRODUCTIVELY
HOPEFULLY
IVE
MISUNDERSTOOD
BTW
IM
NOT
A
BIG
FAN
OF
ARMS
MYSELF
