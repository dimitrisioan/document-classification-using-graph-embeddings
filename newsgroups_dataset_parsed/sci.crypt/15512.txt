clipper
might
be
a
good
way
to
cover
the
use
of
another
layer
of
encryption
but
if
you
are
making
custom
equipment
in
any
case
why
not
just
roll
your
own
clipper
implementation
and
report
the
wrong
keys
to
the
escrow
agency
tells
us
who
is
going
to
be
in
the
chip
business
if
this
thing
goes
throughnsa
and
those
with
something
to
hide
from
nsa
if
anyone
can
verify
that
your
phone
is
not
using
the
key
registered
to
that
serial
number
either
they
have
a
court
ordered
wiretap
but
what
are
they
going
to
do
tell
the
judge
that
this
individual
really
does
have
privacy
all
they
know
is
that
the
keys
are
not
enough
but
not
why
they
have
a
court
ordered
wiretap
on
a
phone
in
this
series
this
part
is
really
scary
since
the
expectation
is
that
all
chips
in
a
particular
batch
will
uses
seeds
based
on
the
same
and
and
the
serial
number
getting
the
keys
for
one
of
a
batch
may
give
access
to
all
there
is
a
backdoor
which
allows
all
messages
to
be
deciphered
without
the
keys
i
find
this
one
especially
threatening
since
the
scheme
seems
very
open
to
known
plaintext
attacks
what
i
need
to
decipher
is
the
data
in
the
header
if
i
talk
to
someone
who
has
one
of
these
phones
presumably
there
will
be
an
automatically
negotiated
key
generated
im
not
trying
to
decipher
the
record
of
the
conversation
to
know
what
was
said
i
use
it
as
a
known
plaintext
to
recover
the
backdoor
represented
by
the
header
but
i
know
what
the
header
says
for
conversations
i
participate
in
even
worse
if
the
phones
in
a
series
have
related
keys
i
can
buy
a
phonechip
from
the
same
production
lot
then
i
can
recover
its
keys
either
elegantly
by
talking
to
myself
or
by
brute
force
analysis
of
the
actual
chip
then
apply
the
key
generation
process
with
those
seeds
to
find
the
target
keys
hmmm
i
dont
think
i
want
to
ever
come
close
to
these
phones
even
des
is
starting
to
look
good
two
cans
and
a
string
will
provide
much
better
security
