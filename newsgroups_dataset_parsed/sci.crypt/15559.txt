D
J
BERNSTEIN
WRITES
I
WANT
TO
SEE
AN
ORGANIZATION
WHICH
WILL
COMBAT
SUCH
STATEMENTS
ENCRYPTION
DOES
NOT
THREATEN
THE
PUBLIC
SAFETY
ANY
MORE
THAN
SKI
MASKS
DO
EVERY
AMERICAN
IS
ENTITLED
TO
USE
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
WHICH
ENSURES
HIS
OWN
PRIVACY
AND
IS
NOT
CRIPPLED
BY
A
KEYESCROW
SYSTEM
I
GUESS
IM
LOOKING
FOR
A
LEAGUE
FOR
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
FREEDOM
OR
A
NATIONAL
CRYPTOGRAPHY
ASSOCIATION
AN
EXCELLENT
IDEA
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
DOES
THE
EFF
SERVE
THIS
PURPOSE
IS
A
NEW
ORGANIZATION
NECESSARY
DOES
IT
ALREADY
EXIST
WHILE
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
FULL
SCOPE
OF
THE
ACTIVITIES
OF
THE
EFF
FROM
WHAT
LITTLE
IVE
SEEN
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
BETTER
TO
LOBBY
FOR
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
THROUGH
A
DISTINCT
ORGANIZATION
THE
EFF
HAS
BEEN
ASSOCIATED
WITH
EFFORTS
TO
PREVENT
THE
BANNING
OF
SEX
AND
PICTURES
NEWSGROUPS
AT
VARIOUS
UNIVERSITIES
HORROR
STORIES
ABOUT
THE
CONTENTS
OF
THOSE
GROUPS
EG
EXPLOITATIVE
PICTURES
OF
POSSIBLY
UNDERAGED
MODELS
HAVE
ALREADY
SURFACED
IN
THE
PRESS
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
BULLETIN
ALREADY
RAISED
THE
SPECTER
OF
DRUGDEALING
AND
TERRORISM
WHICH
IS
ONLY
ONE
STEP
REMOVED
FROM
THE
OLD
CRYPTOWIELDING
CHILD
MOLESTER
ARGUMENT
AN
EFF
LOBBYING
EFFORT
FOR
CRYPTOGRAPHY
WOULD
BE
TOO
EASILY
DERAILED
BY
THE
CONNECTION
TO
CHILD
PORNOGRAPHY
AND
THE
LIKE
SIMILARLY
LPF
IS
CONNECTED
WITH
STALLMAN
AND
HIS
GNU
PROJECT
IN
LIGHT
OF
SAY
THE
GNU
MANIFESTO
THIS
MEANS
THAT
IN
A
PUBLIC
DEBATE
IT
STANDS
TO
BE
LABELLED
AS
COMMUNIST
ANARCHIST
HACKERS
RADICAL
ETC
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
CPSR
BUT
IF
IT
IS
AN
OFFSHOOT
OF
PHYSICIANS
FOR
SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
BEST
KNOWN
FOR
HELEN
CALDICOTT
AND
HER
HYSTERICAL
ANTINUCLEAR
LOBBYING
THEN
IT
PROBABLY
ALSO
CARRIES
UNWELCOME
POLITICAL
BAGGAGE
PERHAPS
FOR
PRACTICAL
REASONS
A
LOBBYING
ORGANIZATION
FOR
CRYPTOGRAPHY
WOULD
BEST
BE
FORMED
UNDER
THE
UMBRELLA
OF
EFF
OR
SOME
OTHER
EXISTING
GROUP
BUT
ITS
CHARTER
SHOULD
THEN
BE
DISTINCT
INDEPENDENT
AND
LIMITED
TO
ADVOCACY
FOR
THE
RIGHT
TO
CRYPTOGRAPHY
TO
REITERATE
DAN
BERNSTEINS
QUESTION
DOES
ANY
SUITABLE
ORGANIZATION
EXIST
IF
NOT
WHAT
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
DO
ABOUT
IT
HAVING
MENTIONED
THE
POSSIBLE
DANGERS
OF
UNWELCOME
POLITICAL
ASSOCIATIONS
I
WOULD
BE
REMISS
NOT
TO
SUGGEST
SOMETHING
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
GATHERING
THE
SUPPORT
OF
THE

BY
EMPHASIZING
