ONCE
TAPPED
YOUR
CODE
IS
NO
GOOD
ANY
MORE
IT
OCCURS
TO
ME
THAT
IF
THEY
GET
A
WIRETAP
ORDER
ON
YOU
AND
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
RELEASE
YOUR
CODE
TO
THE
COPS
YOUR
CODE
IS
NOW
NO
LONGER
SECURE
ITS
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
COPS
AND
WHILE
I
AM
SURE
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THEY
ARE
GOOD
THEIR
SECURITY
WILL
NOT
BE
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
WHAT
THIS
EFFECTIVELY
MEANS
IS
THAT
IF
THEY
PERFORM
A
WIRETAP
ON
YOU
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
WIRETAP
THEY
SHOULD
BE
OBLIGATED
TO
INFORM
YOU
THAT
A
TAP
WAS
PERFORMED
AND
REPLACE
FOR
FREE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
YOUR
CELLULAR
PHONE
SO
THAT
IT
IS
ONCE
AGAIN
A
CODE
KNOWN
ONLY
TO
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
DO
THE
POLICE
NORMALLY
REVEAL
EVERY
TAP
THEY
DO
EVEN
IF
NO
CHARGES
ARE
LAID
IN
MANY
WAYS
IT
WOULD
BE
A
POSITIVE
STEP
IF
THEY
HAD
TO
JUDGES
SET
TIME
LIMITS
ON
WARRANTS
I
ASSUME
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TIME
LIMIT
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
TO
RENEW
OR
REPLACE
YOUR
CHIP
THATS
IF
WE
GO
WITH
THIS
SCHEME
WHICH
I
AM
NOT
SURE
I
