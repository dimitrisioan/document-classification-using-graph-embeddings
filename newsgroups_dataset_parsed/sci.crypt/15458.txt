COVER
FOR
OTHER

METHOD
CLIPPER
MIGHT
BE
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
COVER
THE
USE
OF
ANOTHER
LAYER
OF
ENCRYPTION
CURRENTLY
WHEN
YOU
SEND
AN
ENCRYPTED
MESSAGE
AN
OPPONENT
CAN
USUALLY
TELL
THAT
YOU
ARE
USING
ENCRYPTION
WHICH
ENCRYPTION
METHOD
YOU
ARE
USING
BECAUSE
THAT
INFORMATION
IS
USUALLY
IN
THE
CLEAR
WITH
CLIPPER
MOST
OPPONENTS
WILL
ONLY
KNOW
THAT
YOU
ARE
SENDING
CLIPPERTEXT
THEY
WONT
KNOW
THAT
YOUR
CLIPPERTEXT
IS
ITSELF
ENCODED
ONLY
THOSE
FEW
OPPONENTS
WHO
GET
YOUR
CLIPPERKEYS
WILL
KNOW
THAT
YOUR
MESSAGE
IS
DOUBLE
ENCRYPTED
KIND
OF
LIKE
A
SAFETY
DEPOSIT
BOX
CONTAINING
A
LOCK
BOX
SO
DONT
JUST
THINK
OF
REPLACEMENTS
FOR
CLIPPER
ALSO
THINK
OF
