ALSO
HOW
ABOUT
A
BOX
THAT
YOU
PLUG
YOUR
PHONE
INTO
WHICH
WOULD
ALLOW
ENCRYPTED
VOICE
COMMUNICATIONS
WITH
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
A
SIMILAR
BOX
DIGITIZING
INPUT
SPEECH
TRANSMITTING
AND
DECRYPTING
ON
THE
OTHER
END
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
A
PUBLICKEY
SYSTEM
COULD
WORK
IN
THIS
REGARD
BUT
IT
MIGHT
HEH
HEH
I
POSTED
THIS
JUST
BEFORE
READING
ALL
THE
CLINTON
CHIP
MESSAGES
I
GUESS
THEY
BEAT
ME
TO
IT
ANYWAY
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GREAT
IDEA
TO
DEVELOP
SUCH
A
PRODUCT
PERHAPS
IN
THE
UNDERGROUND
AS
IT
WOULD
OTHERWISE
PROBABLY
BECOME
ILLEGAL
PRETTY
QUICKLY
HERE
ITS
REALLY
VERY
FEASIBLE
AND
SHOULDNT
BE
TOO
EXPENSIVE
ALL
THATS
NEEDED
IS
A
BOX
WITH
A
PHONE
JACK
ON
ONE
SIDE
A
DSP
IN
THE
MIDDLE
TO
DO
CODEC
FUNCTIONS
OF
SPEECHCOMPRESSED
BYTESTREAM
AND
AN
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
YOUD
PLUG
YOUR
PHONE
INTO
IT
PLUG
THE
INTO
YOUR
COMPUTER
AND
HAVE
A
GOOD
OLD
FASHIONED
NORMAL
MODEM
ON
YOUR
OTHER
PORT
THE
CPU
IN
THE
MIDDLE
WOULD
DO
THE
ENCRYPTION
WITH
A
VERSION
OF
PGP
MODIFIED
TO
WORK
ON
A
BYTE
STREAM
WITH
OR
BETTER
MODEMS
TO
CARRY
THE
BYTESTREAM
IT
SHOULD
WORK
QUALITY
WOULD
ONLY
BE
MARGINALLY
LOWER
THAN
A
NORMAL
TELEPHONE
AT
THE
VERY
HIGHEST
PRICE
YOU
COULD
USE
ONE
OF
THOSE
VOICEMAIL
COMPATIBLE
MODEMS
TO
DO
THE
DIGITISATION
THAT
PUTS
AN
UPPER
BOUND
OF
ABOUT
ON
THE
COST
OF
SUCH
A
BOX
IN
PRACTICE
YOU
REALLY
OUGHT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
THE
PRICE
WELL
BELOW
I
COULD
DO
IT
NOW
IN
SOFTWARE
ON
MY
CHEAPNASTY
HOME
RISC
BOX
ACORN
ARCHIMEDES
WITH
THE
DIGITISING
MICROPHONE
I
BOUGHT
FOR
POUNDS
IF
I
KNEW
HOW
TO
WRITE
GOOD
SPEECH
COMPRESSION
SOFTWARE
WHICH
I
DONT
THE
REASON
IT
WONT
WORK
OF
COURSE
IS
THAT
HARDLY
ANYONE
WILL
HAVE
ONE
THE
ONLY
CONSUMER
EQUIPMENT
TO
HAVE
ENCRYPTION
WILL
USE
THE
WIRETAP
CHIP
ECONOMICS
IM
AFRAID
HOWEVER
WE
CAN
GET
ABOUT
THROUGHPUT
ON
THE
INTERNET
EVEN
WITH
THE
BOTTLENECK
OF
A
MODEM
WHEN
WE
GET
ISDN
FOR
ALL
HA
HA
HA
AND
THE
NEW
NREN
IT
MIGHT
THEN
BE
TRIVIAL
TO
RUN
COMPRESSED
SPEECH
OVER
A
TCPIP
CONNECTION
ON
THE
INTERNET
PERHAPS
WE
SHOULD
START
THINKING
NOW
OF
A
STANDARD
TO
KEEP
VOICE
ON
THE
INTERNET
COMPATIBLE
FOR
EVERYONE
AND
SIDESTEP
THE
CLIPPER
STUFF
AND
USE

FOR
ALL
