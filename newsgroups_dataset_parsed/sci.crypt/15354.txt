fighting
the
clipper
initiative
here
are
some
ideas
for
those
of
you
who
want
to
oppose
the
white
house
clipper
chip
crypto
initiative
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
a
tough
measure
to
fight
since
the
government
has
invested
a
lot
of
resources
in
developing
this
highprofile
initiative
they
are
serious
about
it
now
it
wont
be
as
easy
as
it
was
defeating
senate
bill
in
possible
actions
to
take
in
response
mobilize
your
friends
to
to
all
the
things
on
this
list
and
more
work
the
press
talk
with
your
local
newspapers
science
and
technology
reporter
write
to
your
favorite
trade
rags
better
yet
write
some
articles
yourself
for
your
favorite
magazines
or
newspapers
explain
why
the
clipper
chip
initiative
is
a
bad
idea
remember
to
tailor
it
to
your
audience
the
general
public
may
be
slow
to
grasp
why
its
a
bad
idea
since
it
seems
so
technical
and
arcane
and
innocent
sounding
try
not
to
come
across
as
a
flaming
libertarian
paranoid
extremist
even
if
you
are
one
lobby
congress
write
letters
and
make
phone
calls
to
your
member
of
congress
in
your
own
district
as
well
as
your
two
us
senators
many
members
of
congress
have
aides
that
advise
them
of
technology
issues
talk
to
those
aides
involve
your
local
political
parties
the
libertarian
party
would
certainly
be
interested
there
are
also
libertarian
wings
of
the
democrat
and
republican
parties
the
right
to
privacy
has
a
surprisingly
broad
appeal
spanning
all
parts
of
the
political
spectrum
we
have
many
natural
allies
the
aclu
the
nra
other
activist
groups
that
may
someday
find
themselves
facing
a
government
that
can
suppress
them
much
more
efficiently
if
these
trends
play
themselves
out
but
you
must
articulate
our
arguments
well
if
you
want
to
draw
in
people
who
are
not
familiar
with
these
issues
contribute
money
to
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
eff
and
computer
professionals
for
social
responsibility
cpsr
assuming
these
groups
will
fight
this
initiative
they
need
money
for
legal
expenses
and
lobbying
mobilize
opposition
in
industry
companies
that
will
presumably
develop
products
that
will
incorporate
the
clipper
chip
should
be
lobbied
against
it
from
within
and
from
without
if
you
work
for
a
telecommunications
equipment
vendor
first
enlist
the
aid
of
your
coworkers
and
fellow
engineers
against
this
initiative
and
then
present
your
companys
management
with
a
united
front
of
engineering
talent
against
this
initiative
write
persuasive
memos
to
your
management
with
your
name
and
your
colleagues
names
on
it
hold
meetings
on
it
publicize
deploy
and
entrench
as
much
guerrilla
technomonkeywrenching
apparatus
as
you
can
that
means
pgp
anonymous
mail
forwarding
systems
based
on
pgp
pgp
key
servers
etc
the
widespread
availability
of
this
kind
of
technology
might
also
be
used
as
an
argument
that
it
cant
be
effectively
suppressed
by
government
action
i
will
also
be
working
to
develop
new
useful
tools
for
these
purposes
be
prepared
to
engage
in
an
impending
public
policy
debate
on
this
topic
we
dont
know
yet
how
tough
this
fight
will
be
so
we
may
have
to
compromise
to
get
most
of
what
we
want
if
we
cant
outright
defeat
it
we
may
have
to
live
with
a
modified
version
of
this
clipper
chip
plan
in
the
end
so
wed
better
be
prepared
to
analyze
the
governments
plan
and
articulate
how
we
want
it
modified
