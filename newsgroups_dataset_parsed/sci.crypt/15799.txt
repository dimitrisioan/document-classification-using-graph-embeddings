i
also
believe
that
someone
will
reverse
engineer
the
clipper
chip
and
knowlege
of
the
algorithm
will
likely
be
fairly
widespread
any
back
doors
or
weaknesses
would
further
discredit
the
scheme
and
help
grow
the
market
demand
for
a
secure
alternative
there
are
companies
one
in
canada
as
i
recall
which
specialize
in
analyzing
chips
to
understand
process
technology
design
rules
to
understand
the
probable

of
the
assembly
line
making
them
and
therefore
the

taiwanese
japanese
and
especially
korean
semiconductor
manufacturers
have
all
korea
continues
reverseengineered
foreign
chips
and
produced
the
chip
taiwan
and
japan
have
signed
intellectual
property
treaties
and
now
at

extract
the
gatetransitor
level
design
before
laying
the
chip
out
again
the
koreans
still
use
masklevel
copying
i
believe
at
least
they
are
under
a
lot
of
pressure
to
pass
laws
to
meet
international
intellectual
property
standards
all
this
despite
lots
of
attempts
to
hide
the
designs
there
are
lots
of
techniques
to
do
so
in
both
hardware
and
software
design
for
a
complex
chip
there
will
be
real
intellectual
effort
extracting
the
gate
design
from
the
transistor
design
and
the
algorithm
from
the
gate
design
but
it
wont
take
two
