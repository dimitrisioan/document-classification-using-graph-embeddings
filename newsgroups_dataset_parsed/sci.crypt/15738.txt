WRITES
I
THINK
THIS
IS
NO
ACCIDENT
IT
COMES
FROM
THE
SAME
PHILOSOPHY
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
RULESCONTROLS
THE
PEOPLE
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
CONTROLLING
THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT
THE
UNCONNECTED
CITIZENS
ARE
NOT
SOPHISTICATED
ENOUGH
TO
KNOW
WHAT
IS
BEST
FOR
THEM
SO
THE
GOVERNMENT
MUST
TELL
THE
PEOPLE
WHAT
THEY
NEED
OR
DO
NOT
NEED
WE
KNOW
BEST
AND
THE
IDEA
THAT
THAT
A
COMMONER
CAN
DEFEND
HIMSELF
AGAINST
GOVERNMENT
EAVESDROPPING
OR
UNLAWFUL
ATTACK
IS
TOTALLY
UNACCEPTABLE
TO
PEOPLE
WITH
THIS
OUTLOOK
COMBINE
THIS
ALL
WITH
PUSHING
FOR
NATIONAL
IDENTITY
CARDS
WITH
SMART
CHIPS
TO
ENCODE
ANYTHING
THEY
PLEASE
INTERNAL
PASSPORT
UNDER
THE
GUISE
OF
STREAMLINING
THE
STATE
PEOPLES
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
AND
WITH
YOU
CAN
BE
CERTAIN
MORE
JEWELS
YET
TO
COME
AND
ONE
SEES
AN
EXTREMELY
OMINOUS
TREND
SO
WHAT
IF
WILL
BE
TEN
YEARS
LATE
IT
STILL
IS
TURNING
OUT
TO
BE
AN
AMAZINGLY
ACCURATE
PROPHECY
UNLESS
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WAKE
UP
AND
IN
A
HURRY
ONE
SHOULD
ALWAYS
HAVE
EVERY
RED
WARNING
LIGHT
AND
BELL
AND
DANGER
FLAG
COME
UP
WHEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
SEEKS
TO
SET
ITSELF
APART
IN
REGARD
TO
RIGHTS
ETC
FROM
THE
UNCONNECTEDUNPRIVILEGED
CITIZEN
OR
SHOULD
WE
NOW
BE
SAYING
SUBJECT
INSTEAD
WHY
SHOULDNT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
HAVE
A
GOOD
SECURE
SYSTEM
OF
DATA
SECURITY
NOT
DEPENDENT
ON
NEBULOUS
SAFEGUARDS
FOR
MAINTAINING
THAT
SECURITY
WHY
SHOULDNT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
BE
ABLE
TO
DEFEND
HIMSELF
FROM
AN
AGENCY
GONE
ROGUE
AM
SURE
THE
FEDS
COULD
BREAK
INTO
ANY
DATA
THEY
REALLY
WANTED
TO
BUT
IT
WOULD
TAKE
SOME
WORK
AND
USING
THE
SAME
LOGIC
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
A
GOOD
SAFE
UNLESS
A
DUPLICATE
OF
THE
KEYS
OR
COMBINATION
ARE
SUBMITTED
FOR
SAFEKEEPING
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
I
DONT
REALLY
SEE
A
DIFFERENCE
PHILOSOPHICALLY
ENCRYPTED
DATA
SURE
WONT
EVAPORATE
NOT
WITH
SUCH
HIGHTECH
TOOLS
AS
A
TAPE
RECORDER
THE
AVERAGE
AMERIKAN
TODAY
SEEMS
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
EAVESDROP
ON
EVERYONE
ELSE
OPINION
POLLS
SHOW
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
BELIVE
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
TO
GRANT
TOO
MUCH
FREEDOM
TO
PEOPLE
WHEN
IT
IS
NOT
IDENTIFIED
AS
SUCH
BTW
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
OF
A
CITE
FOR
THAT
ID
LOVE
TO
HAVE
IT
NOT
ONLY
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
WILLING
TO
GIVE
UP
EVERYONE
ELSES
RIGHTS
THEY
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
ACTUALLY
SAYS
HOW
CAN
WE
SHOW
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
NOT
THE
AVERAGE
USENET
READER
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
ACTUALLY
ENTITILED
TO
THESE
RIGHTS
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
DONT
CARE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
TAKING
MORE
AND
MORE
CONTROL
OF
US
ALL
A
LITTLE
AT
A
TIME
IF
THERE
WAS
SOME
SORT
OF
AWARENESS
OF
WHAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
TRYING
TO
DO
BY
A
MAJORITY
OF
THE
US
POPULATION
JUST
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
COULD
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
BUT
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
THAT
TRUST
UNTHINKINGLY
IN
WHATEVER
THE
MEDIA
AND
GOVERNMENT
TELL
THEM
