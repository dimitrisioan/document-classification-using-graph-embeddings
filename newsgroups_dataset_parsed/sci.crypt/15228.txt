fact
it
is
unlawful
to
distribute
code
implementing
rsa
without
a
license
to
do
so
from
pkp
whether
or
not
one
is
charging
for
it
furthermore
any
use
of
rsa
other
than
for
research
purposes
allowed
under
us
patent
law
is
similarly
unlawful
therefore
the
average
citizen
cannot
use
rsa
to
encrypt
message
traffic
in
the
us
without
a
license
from
pkp
wrong
i
dont
think
even
pkp
claims
this
one
it
is
not
unlawful
to
distribute
code
implementing
rsa
it
appears
to
be
unlawful
to
use
it
so
i
agree
with
your
last
sentence
fact
there
are
no
restrictions
yet
on
the
use
of
cryptography
under
us
law
although
this
is
beginning
to
look
like
it
will
change
the
only
impediments
to
widespread
use
of
rsa
cryptography
in
the
us
are
pkps
patents
yes
thats
correct
