once
it
hits
land
you
can
record
it
if
you
have
telco
access
the
telco
isnt
supposed
to
give
that
without
a
warrant
thats
the
rule
today
but
even
so
the
evidence
would
not
be
admissible
i
think
unless
the
judge
so
ordered
i
think
that
even
interception
of
the
crypttext
without
a
warrant
would
be
illegal
cops
cant
record
todays
plain
cellular
calls
and
then
ask
a
judge
hey
can
we
have
permission
to
listen
to
those
tapes
can
they
how
long
do
you
think
it
will
be
before
it
becomes
legal
for
the
police
to
record
encrypted
conversations
its
not
violating
your
privacy
because
we
cant
read
the
encryption
without
a
warrant
with
the
usual
goodfaith
exception
if
they
accidentally
record
a
nonencrypted
conversation
besides
its
covered
by
the
drug
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
pray
for
peace
