whose
parenthesized
name
is
either
an
unfortunate
coincidence
or
casts
serious
doubt
on
his
bona
fides
posts
a
message
in
which
he
seems
willing
to
take
the
word
of
a
private
firm
about
which
he
knows
little
that
their
new
encryption
algorithm
is
secure
and
contains
no
trapdoors
while
seemingly
distrusting
that
of
the
government
about
clipper
i
have
a
couple
reasons
why
i
would
be
more
likely
to
trust
this
algorithm
the
algorithm
will
be
made
totally
public
once
it
is
patented
the
keys
will
not
be
escrowed
of
course
if
either
of
these
is
not
true
i
will
not
use
this
new
algorithm
since
i
have
never
seen
this
new
algorithm
i
have
no
idea
how
secure
it
is
yet
i
suppose
it
depends
on
how
paranoid
one
wishes
to
be
but
how
does
the
writer
know
the
firm
isnt
for
example
an
nsa
front
for
purposes
of
this
message
how
do
we
know
psionic
isnt
i
dont
suggest
that
but
post
this
to
point
out
that
there
is
a
class
of
speculation
that
has
no
more
truth
value
without
lots
of
hard
evidence
than
the
contrary
one
by
the
way
if
psionic
had
said
in
lower
case
letters
that
the
firm
claims
there
was
no
back
door
id
have
no
problem
with
that
phrasing
i
cant
make
any
judgements
about
the
algorithm
itself
yet
but
i
do
notice
that
the
creators
of
this
algorithm
are
being
more
open
about
how
the
thing
works
and
is
willing
to
make
it
public
showing
that
after
a
bit
of
scrutiny
any
weaknesses
will
probably
be
revealed
while
we
dont
know
about
clipper

anyone
who
