recently
published
a
new
privacyprotecting
offline
electronic
cash
system
as
a
technical
report
at
cwi
being
a
phdstudent
at
david
chaums
cryptographygroup
our
group
has
a
long
history
in
research
in
the
field
of
privacyprotecting
cash
systems
the
report
is
called
contains
pages

abstract
from
coverpage
we
present
a
new
offline
electronic
cash
system
based
on
a
problem
called
the
representation
problem
of
which
little
use
has
been
made
in
literature
thus
far
our
system
is
the
first
to
be
based
entirely
on
discrete
logarithms
using
the
representation
problem
as
a
basic
concept
some
techniques
are
introduced
that
enable
us
to
construct
protocols
for
withdrawal
and
payment
that
do
not
use
the
cut
and
choose
methodology
of
earlier
systems
as
a
consequence
our
cash
system
is
much
more
efficient
in
both
computation
and
communication
complexity
than
any
such
system
proposed
previously
another
important
aspect
of
our
system
concerns
its
provability
contrary
to
previously
proposed
systems
its
correctness
can
be
mathematically
proven
to
a
very
great
extent
specifically
if
we
make
one
plausible
assumption
concerning
a
single
hashfunction
the
ability
to
break
the
system
seems
to
imply
that
one
can
break
the
diffiehellman
problem
our
system
offers
a
number
of
extensions
that
are
hard
to
achieve
in
previously
known
systems
in
our
opinion
the
most
interesting
of
these
is
that
the
entire
cash
system
including
all
the
extensions
can
be
incorporated
in
a
setting
based
on
wallets
with
observers
which
has
the
important
advantage
that
doublespending
can
be
prevented
in
the
first
place
rather
than
detecting
the
identity
of
a
doublespender
after
the
fact
in
particular
it
can
be
incorporated
even
under
the
most
stringent
requirements
conceivable
about
the
privacy
of
the
user
which
seems
to
be
impossible
to
do
with
previously
proposed
systems
another
benefit
of
our
system
is
that
framing
attempts
by
a
bank
have
negligible
probability
of
success
independent
of
computing
power
by
a
simple
mechanism
from
within
the
system
which
is
something
that
previous
solutions
lack
entirely
furthermore
the
basic
cash
system
can
be
extended
to
checks
multishow
cash
and
divisibility
while
retaining
its
computational
efficiency
cryptographers
are
challenged
to
try
to
break
this
system
i
made
a
particular
effort
to
keep
the
report
as
selfcontained
as
possible
nevertheless
if
you
have
any
questions
please
email
to
me
and
i
will
try
to
reply
as
good
as
i
can
any
comments
are
also
welcome
