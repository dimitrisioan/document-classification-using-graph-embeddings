WRITES
ADDITONALLY
I
SPOKE
WITH
MR
MELNICK
ABOUT
THEIR
ALGORITHM
HE
COULDNT
TELL
ME
MUCH
ABOUT
THEIR
NEW
AGORITHM
BECAUSE
IT
HASNT
BEEN
PATENTED
YET
RIGHT
NOW
THE
COMPANY
IS
AFRAID
THAT
THE
NEW
CLIPPER
CHIP
WILL
PUT
THEM
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
THIS
IS
A
VERY
REAL
POSSIBILITY
SO
THEY
REALLY
NEED
HELP
IN
STOPPING
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
FROM
BECOMING
A
STANDARD
IF
THEYRE
PLANNING
ON
PATENTING
AN
ALGORITHM
THEN
I
HOPE
THEY
GO
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
AS
QUICKLY
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
YOU
CAN
TELL
THEM
I
SAID
THAT
IM
SURE
MANY
OTHER
READERS
OF
THESE
NEWSGROUPS
WILL
AGREE
TOO
MATHEW
