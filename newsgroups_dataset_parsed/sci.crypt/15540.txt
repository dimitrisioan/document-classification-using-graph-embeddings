WRITES
ACTUALLY
I
AM
COMPLETELY
BAFFLED
BY
WHY
DOROTHY
DENNING
HAS
CHOSEN
TO
THROW
AWAY
HER
ACADEMIC
RESPECTABILITY
LIKE
THIS
IT
LOOKS
TO
ME
LIKE
A
MAJOR
CAREER
LIMITING
MOVE
THERE
CAN
BE
VERY
FEW
PEOPLE
WHO
KNOW
WHAT
SHES
BEEN
SAYING
WHO
TAKE
HER
SERIOUSLY
ANY
MORE
IM
NOT
SURE
IT
IS
A
MAJOR
LIMITING
MOVE
IN
THE
ACADEMIC
CIRCLES
IVE
SEEN
ARGUING
FOR
INCREASED
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
AND
MANAGEMENT
IS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
A
PLUS
NOT
THE
LEAST
BECAUSE
IT
USUALLY
MEANS
MORE
HIGH
PAYING
JOBS
FOR
ACADEMICS
AS
ADVISORS
ALSO
CONSIDER
THAT
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
DENNING
HAS
SOME
DECENT
NSA
GOVERNMENT
CONNECTIONS
WHICH
IS
ALWAYS
A
PLUS
FOR
AN
ACADEMIC
INSTITUTE
THAT
WANTS
MORE
GOVERNMENT
FUNDING
AND
WORK
TOSSED
THEIR
WAY
DESPICABLE
YES
CAREER
LIMITING
WELL
THE
PUBLICITY
PROBABLY
OUTWEIGHS
THE
DRAWBACKS
AND
THERE
ARE
A
WHOLE
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
THINK
THE
WHOLE
THING
IS
JUST
PEACHY
KEEN
IF
ITS
ONLY
GOING
TO
BE
USED
AGAINST
DRUG
DEALERS
CHILD
PORNOGRAPHERS
AND
TERRORISTS
WELL
IT
MUST
BE
GOOD
P
TRUTH
IS
HARD
TO
FIND
AND
HARDER
TO
OBSCURE
