what
is
a
product
cipher
a
product
cipher
is
a
block
cipher
that
iterates
several
weak
operations
such
as
substitution
transposition
modular
additionmultiplication
and
linear
transformation
a
block
cipher
just
means
a
cipher
that
encrypts
a
block
of
bytes
sayall
at
once
then
goes
on
to
the
next
block
the
notion
of
product
ciphers
is
due
to
shannon
examples
of
modern
product
ciphers
include
lucifer
des
spnetworks
loki
feal
pes
khufu
and
khafre
the
socalled
feistel
ciphers
are
a
class
of
product
ciphers
which
operate
on
one
half
of
the
ciphertext
at
each
round
and
then
swap
the
ciphertext
halves
after
each
round
lucifer
des
loki
and
feal
are
examples
of
feistel
ciphers

what
makes
a
product
cipher
secure
nobody
knows
how
to
prove
mathematically
that
a
product
cipher
is
completely
secure
so
in
practice
one
begins
by
demonstrating
that
the
cipher
looks
highly
random
for
example
the
cipher
must
be
nonlinear
and
it
must
produce
ciphertext
which
functionally
depends
on
every
bit
of
the
plaintext
and
the
key
meyer
has
shown
that
at
least
rounds
of
des
are
required
to
guarantee
such
a
dependence
in
this
sense
a
product
cipher
should
act
as
a
mixing
function
which
combines
the
plaintext
key
and
ciphertext
in
a
complex
nonlinear
fashion
the
fixed
perround
substitutions
of
the
product
cipher
are
referred
to
as
sboxes
for
example
lucifer
has
sboxes
and
des
has
sboxes
the
nonlinearity
of
a
product
cipher
reduces
to
a
careful
design
of
these
sboxes
a
list
of
partial
design
criteria
for
the
sboxes
of
des
which
apply
to
sboxes
in
general
may
be
found
in
brown
and
brickell
et
al
what
are
some
grouptheoretic
properties
of
product
ciphers
let
e
be
a
product
cipher
that
maps
nbit
blocks
to
nbit
blocks
let
ekx
be
the
encryption
of
x
under
key
k
then
for
any
fixed
k
the
map
sending
x
to
ekx
is
a
permutation
of
the
set
of
nbit
blocks
denote
this
permutation
by
pk
the
set
of
all
nbit
permutations
is
called
the
symmetric
group
and
is
written
the
collection
of
all
these
permutations
pk
where
k
ranges
over
all
possible
keys
is
denoted
if
e
were
a
random
mapping
from
plaintexts
to
ciphertexts
then
we
would
expect
to
generate
a
large
subset
of
coppersmith
and
grossman
have
shown
that
a
very
simple
product
cipher
can
generate
the
alternating
group
given
a
sufficient
number
of
rounds
the
alternating
group
is
half
of
the
symmetric
group
it
consists
of
all
even
permutations
ie
all
permutations
which
can
be
written
as
an
even
number
of
swaps
even
and
goldreich
were
able
to
extend
these
results
to
show
that
feistel
ciphers
can
generate
given
a
sufficient
number
of
rounds
the
security
of
multiple
encipherment
also
depends
on
the
grouptheoretic
properties
of
a
cipher
multiple
encipherment
is
an
extension
over
single
encipherment
if
for
keys
there
does
not
exist
a
third
key
such
that
which
indicates
that
encrypting
twice
with
two
independent
keys
is
equal
to
a
single
encryption
under
the
third
key
if
for
every
there
exists
a
such
that
eq
is
true
then
we
say
that
e
is
a
group
this
question
of
whether
des
is
a
group
under
this
definition
was
extensively
studied
by
sherman
kaliski
and
rivest
in
their
paper
they
give
strong
evidence
for
the
hypothesis
that
des
is
not
a
group
in
fact
des
is
not
a
group
what
can
be
proven
about
the
security
of
a
product
cipher
recall
from
above
that
pk
is
a
permutation
produced
by
e
under
some
key
k
the
goal
of
the
designer
of
e
is
to
ensure
that
pk
appears
to
be
a
random
element
of
the
symmetric
group
let
r
be
an
element
of
selected
randomly
we
will
say
that
pk
and
r
are
indistinguishable
if
an
observer
given
pk
and
r
in
some
order
cannot
distinguish
between
these
two
permutations
in
polynomial
time
that
is
with
time
bounded
resources
the
observer
cannot
determine
which
of
the
permutations
is
produced
by
e
the
optimal
decision
is
no
better
than
simply
guessing
luby
and
rackoff
have
shown
that
a
class
of
feistel
ciphers
are
secure
in
this
sense
when
the
round
mapping
is
replaced
by
random
boolean
functions
how
are
block
ciphers
used
to
encrypt
data
longer
than
the
block
size
there
are
four
standard
modes
of
operation
and
numerous
nonstandard
ones
as
well
the
standard
modes
of
operation
are
defined
in
the
us
department
of
commerce
federal
information
processing
standard
fips
published
in
see
the
question
about
ecb
below
for
more
details
although
they
are
defined
for
the
des
block
cipher
the
modes
of
operation
can
be
used
with
any
block
cipher
can
symmetric
block
ciphers
be
used
for
message
authentication
one
may
use
a
symmetric
cryptosystem
block
cipher
to
prove
to
himself
that
he
did
or
did
not
generate
a
message
and
to
prove
to
himself
whether
his
message
was
altered
or
unaltered
since
generation
but
one
cannot
prove
these
things
to
another
without
revealing
the
key
and
thereafter
that
key
cannot
be
used
to
prove
anything
about
any
messages
that
were
authenticated
using
that
key

triple
des
is
a

which
like
des
operates
on

there
are
several

some

some

the

in

and
is
intended

carl

keeps
advocating

in
the
form
tran

compress
x
where
each
des
instance
has
its
own
key
and
iv
for
cbc
mode
and
tran
has
been
posted
on
scicrypt
it
is
a
largeblock
transposition
program
taking
its
key
from
the
data
stream
itself
so
that
it
is
not
an
encryption
program
on
its
own
part
what
is
differential
cryptanalysis
differential
cryptanalysis
is
a
statistical
attack
that
can
be
applied
to
any
iterated
mapping
ie
any
mapping
which
is
based
on
a
repeated
round
function
the
method
was
recently
popularized
by
biham
and
shamir
but
coppersmith
has
remarked
that
the
sboxes
of
des
were
optimized
against
this
attack
some
years
ago
this
method
has
proved
effective
against
several
product
ciphers
notably
feal
differential
cryptanalysis
is
based
on
observing
a
large
number
of
ciphertexts
y
y
whose
corresponding
plaintexts
x
x
satisfy
a
known
difference
d
xx
where
is
componentwise
xor
in
the
basic
bihamshamir
attack
such
plaintext
pairs
are
required
to
determine
the
key
for
des
substantially
fewer
pairs
are
required
if
des
is
truncated
to
or
rounds
in
these
cases
the
actual
key
can
be
recovered
in
a
matter
of
minutes
using
a
few
thousand
pairs
for
full
des
this
attack
is
impractical
because
it
requires
so
many
known
plaintexts
the
work
of
biham
and
shamir
on
des
revealed
several
startling
observations
on
the
algorithm
most
importantly
if
the
key
schedule
was
removed
from
des
and
a
key
was
used
the
key
could
be
recovered
in
less
than
steps
thus
independent
subkeys
do
not
add
substantial
security
to
des
further
the
sboxes
of
des
are
extremely
sensitive
in
that
changing
even
single
entries
in
these
tables
yields
significant
improvement
in
the
differential
attack
adi
shamir
is
quoted
to
say
nytimes
oct
i
would
say
that
contrary
to
what
some
people
believe
there
is
no
evidence
of
tampering
with
the
des
so
that
the
basic
design
was
weakened
how
was
nsa
involved
in
the
design
of
des
according
to
kinnucan
tuchman
a
member
of
the
group
that
developed
des
at
ibm
is
quoted
as
saying
we
developed
the
des
algorithm
entirely
within
ibm
using
ibmers
the
nsa
did
not
dictate
a
single
wire
tuchman
and
meyer
another
developer
of
des
spent
a
year
breaking
ciphers
and
finding
weaknesses
in
lucifer
they
then
spent
two
years
strengthening
lucifer
their
basic
approach
was
to
look
for
strong
substitution
permutation
and
key
scheduling
functions
ibm
has
classified
the
notes
containing
the
selection
criteria
at
the
request
of
the
nsa
the
nsa
told
us
we
had
inadvertently
reinvented
some
of
the
deep
secrets
it
uses
to
make
its
own
algorithms
explains
tuchman
on
the
other
hand

document
called

of
the

the

of

of
the
united
states
select
committee
on

printed
in
the
ieee
communications
magazine
states
in
the
development
of
des
nsa
convinced
ibm
that
a
reduced
keysize
was
sufficient
indirectly
assisted
in
the
development
of
the
sbox
structures
and
certified
that
the
final
des
algorithm
was
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
free
from
any
statistical
or
mathematical
weakness
clearly
the
key
size
was
reduced
at
the
insistence
of
the
nsa
the
article
further
states
that
the
nsa
did
not
tamper
with
the
algorithm
itself
just
the
parameters
which
in
some
sense
resolves

apparent
conflict
