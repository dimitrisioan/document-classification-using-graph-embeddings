MARCUS
J
RANUM
WRITES
ABOUT
SCANNING
CLIPPER
AND
REVERSEENGINEERING
THE
ALGORITHM
AM
I
MISSING
SOMETHING
OBVIOUS
HERE
WHAT
COULD
HAVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
DONE
TO
ADDRESS
THIS
POSSIBILITY
DO
THEY
REALLY
CARE
IF
IT
STAYS
CLASSIFIED
YEAH
YOURE
MISSING
THE
OBVIOUS
FACT
THAT
SINCE
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
CLASSIFIED
IF
YOU
REVERSE
ENGINEER
IT
FROM
THE
CHIP
AND
LATER
PUBLISH
IT
OR
BUILD
A
COMPATIBLE
CHIP
YOURE
DIVULGING
CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION
AND
ARE
IN
A
BIG
LOAD
OF
TROUBLE
I
DONT
THINK
THEY
CAN
DO
THAT
WITHOUT
CHANGING
THE
LAW
THE
CHIP
ITSELF
ISNT
CLASSIFIED
AND
REVERSE
ENGINEERING
IS
ALLOWED
BY
LAW
POSSIBLY
UNLESS
PROHIBITED
BY
A
VALID
CONTRACT
THE
ALGORITHM
MAY
BE
CLASSIFIED
BUT
THERE
ARE
MANY
COURT
CASES
RULING
THAT
INFORMATION
IDENTICAL
TO
CLASSFIED
INFORMATION
BUT
OBTAINED
FROM
UNCLASSIFIED
SOURCES
IS
FREELY
PUBLISHABLE
WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
EXCEPTION
OF
NUCLEAR
WEAPON
