THIS

THE

OF
EXPANDING
A

THIS

MUST
BE

IDEALLY
IT

PERHAPS

WHEN

TO
MEASURE
THE

OF

PRODUCE

THE

IS

ONE
OF
THE

GENERATORS
WHERE
THERE

NO

UNFORTUNATELY
THE

AT

AND
WHAT
IS
THE

LIST
FOR
ENGLISH

THERE
ARE
THREE
ANSWERS
TO
THIS
QUESTION
EACH
SLIGHTLY
DEEPER
THAN
THE
ONE
BEFORE
YOU
CAN
FIND
THE
FIRST
ANSWER
IN
VARIOUS
BOOKS
NAMELY
A
FREQUENCY
LIST
COMPUTED
DIRECTLY
FROM
A
CERTAIN
SAMPLE
OF
ENGLISH
TEXT
OF
COURSE
ANY
SUCH
LIST
WILL
BE
CORRECTLY
COMPUTED
BUT
EXACTLY
WHICH
LIST
YOU
GET
DEPENDS
ON
WHICH
SAMPLE
WAS
TAKEN
THE
SECOND
ANSWER
IS
THAT
THE
QUESTION
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
ENGLISH
LETTERS
THE
ENGLISH
LANGUAGE
IS
NOT
A
FIXED
FINITE
CLOSED
OBJECT
THAT
CAN
BE
EXACTLY
CHARACTERIZED
IT
HAS
CHANGED
OVER
TIME
IT
IS
DIFFERENT
BETWEEN
DIFFERENT
AUTHORS
ANY
PARTICULAR
MESSAGE
WILL
HAVE
DIFFERENT
STATISTICS
FROM
THOSE
OF
THE
LANGUAGE
AS
A
WHOLE
THE
THIRD
ANSWER
IS
THAT
YES
NO
PARTICULAR
MESSAGE
IS
GOING
TO
HAVE
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
CHARACTERISTICS
AS
ENGLISH
IN
GENERAL
BUT
FOR
ALL
REASONABLE
STATISTICAL
USES
THESE
SLIGHT
DISCREPANCIES
WONT
MATTER
IN

THERES
AN
ENTIRE

THE
CHANCE
THAT
A

WITH
THESE

FREQUENCIES
IS

AND
COMES
UP
WITH
REASONABLY
ROBUST
ANSWERS
SO
MAKE
YOUR
OWN
LIST
FROM
YOUR

OF
ENGLISH

IT
WILL
BE
GOOD

FOR

IF
