introduction
on
april
the
president
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
together
the
federal
government
and
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
provide
secure
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
at
the
heart
of
the
plan
is
a
new
tamperproof
encryption
chip
called
the
clipper
chip
together
with
a
splitkey
approach
to
escrowing
keys
two
escrow
agencies
are
used
and
the
key
parts
from
both
are
needed
to
reconstruct
a
key
chip
contents
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
singlekey
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
takes
clock
ticks
and
in
electronic
codebook
ecb
mode
runs
at
mbits
per
second
each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
this
length
is
subject
to
change
u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages
encrypted
with
the
chip
the
chips
are
programmed
by
mykotronx
inc
which
calls
them
the
the
silicon
is
supplied
by
vlsi
technology
inc
they
are
implemented
in
micron
technology
and
will
initially
sell
for
about
each
in
quantities
of
or
more
the
price
should
drop
as
the
technology
is
shrunk
to
micron
encrypting
with
the
chip
to
see
how
the
chip
is
used
imagine
that
it
is
embedded
in
the
att
telephone
security
device
as
it
will
be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
an
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
this
key
negotiation
takes
place
without
the
clipper
chip
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
such
as
the
diffiehellman
publickey
distribution
method
once
the
session
key
k
is
established
the
clipper
chip
is
used
to
encrypt
the
conversation
or
message
stream
m
digitized
voice
the
telephone
security
device
feeds
k
and
m
into
the
chip
to
produce
two
values
em
k
the
encrypted
message
stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a
law
enforcement
field
which
are
transmitted
over
the
telephone
line
the
law
enforcement
field
thus
contains
the
session
key
k
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
u
concatenated
with
the
serial
number
n
all
encrypted
under
the
family
key
f
the
law
enforcement
field
is
decrypted
by
law
enforcement
after
an
authorized
wiretap
has
been
installed
the
ciphertext

is
decrypted
by
the

chip
programming
and
escrow
all
clipper
chips
are
programmed
inside
a
scif
secure
compartmented
information
facility
which
is
essentially
a
vault
the
scif
contains
a
laptop
computer
and
equipment
to
program
the
chips
about
chips
are
programmed
during
a
single
session
the
scif
is
located
at
mykotronx
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
a
secret
random
value
these
random
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
unit
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial
numbers
thus
the
unit
keys
are
a
function
of
secret
random
bits
where
each
agent
knows
only
to
generate
the
unit
key
for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce
and
and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to
and
the
second
bits
to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit
key
u
is
the
xor
of
and
and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
as
a
sequence
of
values
for
and
u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial
number
that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second
disk
is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third
disk
contains
the
unit
keys
u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second
disk
thus
each
agent
walks
away
knowing
an
seed
and
the
key
parts
however
the
agent
does
not
know
the
other
bits
used
to
generate
the
keys
or
the
other
key
parts
the
third
disk
is
used
to
program
the
chips
after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the
vault
and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
the
protocol
may
be
changed
slightly
so
that
four
people
are
in
the
room
instead
of
two
the
first
two
would
provide
the
seeds
and
and
the
second
two
the
escrow
agents
would
take
the
disks
back
to
the
escrow
agencies
the
escrow
agencies
have
as
yet
to
be
determined
but
they
will
not
be
the
nsa
cia
fbi
or
any
other
law
enforcement
agency
one
or
both
may
be
independent
from
the
government
law
enforcement
use
when
law
enforcement
has
been
authorized
to
tap
an
encrypted
line
they
will
first
take
the
warrant
to
the
service
provider
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
communications
line
let
us
assume
that
the
tap
is
in
place
and
that
they
have
determined
that
the
line
is
encrypted
with
the
clipper
chip
the
law
enforcement
field
is
first
decrypted
with
the
family
key
f
giving
ek
u
n
documentation
certifying
that
a
tap
has
been
authorized
for
the
party
associated
with
serial
number
n
is
then
sent
eg
via
secure
fax
to
each
of
the
key
escrow
agents
who
return
eg
also
via
secure
fax
and
and
are
xored
together
to
produce
the
unit
key
u
and
ek
u
is
decrypted
to
get
the
session
key
k
finally
the
message
stream
is
decrypted
all
this
will
be
accomplished
through
a
special
black
box
decoder
capstone
the
next
generation
a
successor
to
the
clipper
chip
called
capstone
by
the
government
and
by
mykotronx
has
already
been
developed
it
will
include
the
skipjack
algorithm
the
digital
signature
standard
dss
the
secure
hash
algorithm
sha
a
method
of
key
exchange
a
fast
exponentiator
and
a
randomizer
a
prototoype
will
be
available
for
testing
on
april
and
the
chips
are
expected
to
be
ready
for
delivery
in
june
