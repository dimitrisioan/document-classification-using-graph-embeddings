the
message
from

nist
about
the
clipper
chip
comes
from
the
following
address
clippercsrcncslnistgov
clipper
chip
announcement
just
who
is
that
i
asked
myself
or
rather
i
asked
the
computer
telnet
csrcncslnistgov
list
of
name
elided
for
brevity
well
isnt
that
interesting
dorothy
denning
mitch
kapor
marc
rotenberg
ron
rivest
jim
bidzos
and
others
the
government
rsa
tis
cpsr
and
the
eff
are
all
represented
i
dont
suppose
anybody
within
any
of
these
organizations
would
care
to
comment
or
is
this
just
the
white
houses
idea
of
a
cruel
joke
on
these
peoples
inboxes
i
know
that
at
least
one
person
on
that
list
says
the
first
he
heard
of
clipper
was
in
the
friday
morning
newspaper
and
another
has
already
fired
off
a
letter
of
protest
to
nist
my
point
i
suspect
this
list
interesting
as
it
is
for
various
reasons
does
not
represent
the
cabal
that
put
this
proposal
together
some
of
them
yes
others
no
this
may
be
nothing
more
than
a
mailing
