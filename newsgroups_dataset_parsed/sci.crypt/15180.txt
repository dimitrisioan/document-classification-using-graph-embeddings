the
cryptokey
disclosure
issue
hasnt
come
up
yet
but
current
law
suggests
that
its
a
loser
for
the
defendanthell
be
compelled
to
turn
over
the
key
it
has
actually
come
up
or
it
will
in
a
week
or
two
in
nz
ill
post
the
outcome
when
the
trial
finishes
which
could
take
months
btw
overall
it
looks
like
you
cant
be
forced
to
reveal
a
password
if
anyone
can
provide
a
convincing
legal
argument
to
the
contrary
ie
an
actual
court
case
id
be
most
interested
