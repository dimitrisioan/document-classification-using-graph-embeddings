TAPPED
YOUR

NO

ANY
MORE
IN

BALLYHO
OVER

I
NOTICED
A
RATHER
DISTURBING
TREND
IN
SOME
OF
THE
EMAIL
AND
POSTS
IVE
TOSSING
BACK
AND
FORTH
SOMEBODY
ASKED
ME
WHAT
WAS
WRONG
ABOUT
OVERREACTING
IN
CASES
SUCH
AS
THIS
THE
REASON
IS
VERY
SIMPLE
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
DIE
IN
A
RIOT
IN
A
NEW
CIVIL
WAR
EVERYBODY
IS
JUMPING
UP
AND
DOWN
AND
SCREAMING
ABOUT
IT
AND
IM
WORRIED
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
REACH
FOR
THEIR
HAMMERS
AND
RIFLES
BEFORE
THEIR
PENS
AND
PAPER
CAN
PEOPLE
WORK
WITHIN
THE
SYSTEM
BEFORE
TRYING
TO
BREAK
IT
EXAMINE
YOUR
HISTORY
BOOKS
AND
FIND
OUT
HOW
MANY
ARMED
REVOLUTIONS
LED
TO
DEMOCRATIC
OR
DEMOCRATIC
STYLE
GOVERNMENTS
I
THINK
YOULL
ONLY
FIND
ONE
IN
OVER
FIVE
THOUSAND
YEARS
OF
WRITTEN
HISTORY
THATS
NOT
VERY
GOOD
ODDS
SOMEBODY
ONCE
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
ARMED
VIOLENCE
IS
MEANT
ONLY
TO
BE
USED
IN
RESPONSE
TO
AN
ARMED
ATTACK
IT
IS
NOT
MEANT
TO
BE
USED
IN
AGRESSION
THIS
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
SELFDEFENCE
AND
MURDER
LETS
TRY
TO
AVOID
KILLING
THINGS
EH
THERES
ENOUGH
BLOOD
SHED
IN
THE
WORLD
WITHOUT
ADDING
A
COUPLE
OF
RIOTS
CIVIL

ETC
IM
PROBABLY
OVERREACTING

WHAT
