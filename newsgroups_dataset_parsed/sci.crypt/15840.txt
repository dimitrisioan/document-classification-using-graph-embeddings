re
i
have
seen
the
lobby
and
it
is
us
nathaniel

wrote
if
some
kind
soul
out
there
would
write
a
letter
and
upload
it
to
the
net
everyone
could
capture
it
print
it
out
and
snailmail
it
out
to
their
local
congressional
critter
btw
im
working
on
one
you
should
realize
that
form
letters
are
the
worst
way
to
influence
your
congresscritters
exact
copies
are
routinely
placed
on
the
lowest
rung
of
the
opinion
ladder
if
you
want
to
write
and
i
think
you
should
take
the
time
to
really
write
a
letter
things
to
emphasize
its
been
said
that
usenet
is
available
to
the
technical
elite
ie
the
techies
at
corporate
sites
and
universi
ties
emphasize
that
you
are
part
of
the
group
that
will
be
makingdevelopingusing
clintons
data
superhighway
explain
how
you
are
intimately
familiar
with
both
computing
and
data
communications
if
this
is
the
case
dont
call
your
self
an
expert
after
wiring
in
a
bps
modem
this
will
distinguish
your
letter
from
the
random
flamers
dont
turn
it
into
braggadocio
just
tell
them
that
you
know
the
technical
sides
of
the
issue
dont
overdo
jargon
and
gobbledygook
remember
your
letter
will
be
first
read
in
all
likelihood
by
a
staffer
who
may
even
be
a
college
student
if
they
dont
understand
it
your
views
wont
even
make
the
running
total
sheets
be
concise
dont
ramble
rants
are
definitely
out
of
place
cite
references
if
necessary
but
only
use
accepted
references
like
academic
journals
my
neighbor
jim
is
not
a
real
refer
ence
unfortunately
very
few
congresscritters
really
understand
electronic
communications
encourage
them
to
pick
up
access
to
compuserve
america
online
or
one
of
the
freenets
offer
to
send
them
samples
if
you
are
in
a
position
to
do
so
offer
them
or
their
staffers
back
in
the
home
state
access
to
your
systems
offer
to
give
a
demonstration
the
next
time
theyre
in
town
your
offer
to
get
personally
involved
in
helping
them
will
give
your
opinions
more
credence
in
addition
to
sending
mail
to
your
representatives
send
mail
to
the
members
of
the
committee
or
subcommittee
that
is
dealing
with
the
issue
if
your
congresscritter
isnt
on
the
committee
they
cant
be
of
much
help
until
the
matter
comes
to
the
floor
wes
ps
id
suggest
drawing
analogies
between
digital
communication
and
the
more
traditional
media
but
usenet
doesnt
have
a
decent
track
record
in
the
analogy
department
