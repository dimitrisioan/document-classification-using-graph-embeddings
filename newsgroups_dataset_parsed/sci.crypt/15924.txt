FROM
JERRY
BERMAN
TO

FROM

IN
RESPONSE

WHILE
I
HAVE
TO
CONGRATULATE
EFF
FOR
ITS
PROMPT
RESPONSE
TO
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
ANNOUNCEMENT
FROM
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
I
THINK
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
PHILOSOPHY
OF
THEIR
EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR
AS
EXPLAINED
BELOW
I
AGREE
THAT
LEGAL
REMEDIES
ARE
IMPORTANT
BUT
WHEN
PRESSED
ID
PREFER
TO
RETAIN
THE
ABILITY
TO
USE
PURELY
TECHNICAL
SOLUTIONS
TO
PRESERVE
MY
PRIVACY
BECAUSE
THEYLL
HOLD
UP
UNDER
FIRE
MR
CHAUM
HAS
CONSENTED
TO
THE
PUBLICATION
OF
THIS
LETTER
ON
THE
NET
I
DONT
WORK
FOR
NOR
AM
I
A
MEMBER
OF
EFF
ACLU
OR
ANY
SIMILAR
ORGANIZATIONS
BUT
I
DO
AGREE
WITH
THEM
ON

DEAR
MR

IRA
GLASSER
EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR
ELEANOR
HOLMES
NORTON
CHAIR
NATIONAL
ADVISORY
COUNCIL
THANK
YOU
FOR
SENDING
ME
A
MOST
INTERESTING
ARTICLE
A
SOCIETY
OF
INDIVIDUALS
AND
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
WOULD
EXPEND
THE
TIME
AND
RESOURCES
TO
USE
A
SERIES
OF
DIGITAL
PSEUDONYMS
TO
AVOID
DATA
LINKAGE
DOES
NOT
IN
MY
OPINION
MAKE
BIG
BROTHER
OBSOLETE
BUT
ACTS
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
BIG
BROTHER
IS
EVER
PRESENT
I
VIEW
YOUR
SYSTEM
AS
A
FORM
OF
SOCIETAL
PARANOIA
AS
A
MATTER
OF
PRINCIPLE
WE
ARE
WORKING
TO
ENACT
FORMAL
LEGAL
PROTECTIONS
FOR
INDIVIDUAL
PRIVACY
RATHER
THAN
RELYING
ON
TECHNICAL
SOLUTIONS
WE
WANT
TO
ASSUME
A
SOCIETY
OF
LAW
WHICH
RESPECTS
LEGAL
LIMITS
RATHER
THAN
A
SOCIETY
THAT
WILL
DISOBEY
THE
LAW
REQUIRING
CITIZENS
TO
DEPEND
ON
TECHNICAL
SOLUTIONS
EG
REQUIRE
A
JUDICAL
WARRANT
FOR
GOVERNMENT
INTERCEPTION
OF
DATA
COMMUNICATIONS
RATHER
THAN
ENCRYPT
ALL
MESSAGES
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
LAWT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
ABUSE
ITS
POWER
AND
INVADE
PRIVACY
AS
A
MATTER
OF
PRACTICALITY
I
DO
NOT
THINK
YOUR
SYSTEM
OFFERS
MUCH
HOPE
FOR
PRIVACY
FIRST
THE
TREND
TOWARD
UNIVERSAL
IDENTIFIERS
IS
AS
MUCHA
MOVEMENT
GENERATED
BY
GOVERNMENT
OR
INDUSTRYS
DESIRE
TO
KEEP
TRACK
OF
ALL
CITIZENS
AS
IT
IS
BY
CITIZENS
SEEKING
SIMPLICITY
AND
CONVENIENCE
IN
ALL
TRANSACTIONS
AT
BEST
YOUR
SYSTEM
WOULD
BENEFIT
THE
SOPHISTICATED
AND
MOST
WOULD
OPT
FOR
SIMPLICITY
THE
POOR
AND
THE
UNDEREDUCATED
WOULD
NEVER
USE
OR
BENEFIT
FROM
IT
FINALLY
WHERE
THERES
A
WILL
THERES
A
WAY
IF
GOVERNMENT
WANTS
TO
LINK
DATA
BASES
IT
WILL
BY
LAW
REQUIRE
THE
DISCLOSURE
OF
VARIOUS
INDIVIDUAL
PSEUDONYMS
USED
BY
CITIZENS
OR
PROHIBIT
IT
FOR
DATA
BASES
WHICH
THE
GOVERNMENT
WANTS
TO
LINK
SINCE
CORPORATIONS
MAKE
MONEY
BY
TRADING
COMMERCIAL
LISTS
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
THEY
WILL
NEVER
ADOPT
THE
SYSTEM
OR
IF
IT
IS
ADOPTED
WILL
USE
FINE
PRINTN
CONTRACTS
TO
PERMIT
SELLING
VARIOUS
CODES
USED
BY
THEIR
CUSTOMERS
TO
OTHER
FIRMS
THE
SOLUTION
REMAINS
LAW
POLICY
AND
CONSENSUS
ABOUT
LIMITS
ON
GOVERNMENT
OR
CORPORATE
INTRUSION
INTO
AREAS
OF
INDIVIDUAL
AUTONOMY
TECHNIQUE
CAN
BE
USED
TO
ENFORCE
THAT
CONSENSUS
OR
TO
OVERRIDE
IT
IT
CANNOT
BE
USED
AS
A
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
SUCH
CONSENSUS
SINCERELY
