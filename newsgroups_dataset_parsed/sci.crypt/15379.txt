get
their
copy
of
your

any
criminal
whos
going
to
use
encryption
will
do
it
under
cover
of
clipper
the
only
way
to
avoid
this
will
be
to
try
to
prohibit
strong
encryption
this
isnt
true
todays
criminals
regularly
use
all
sorts
of
unsafe
methods
from
cordless
phones
to
cellular
phones
to
plain
old
copper
wire
analog
phones
that
you
can
put
alligator
clips
on
to
plan
and
execute
their
crimes
it
is
amazing
how
stupid
they
are
which
is
why
the
fbi
was
so
keen
on
the
digital
telphony
law
and
its
successor
the
clipper
chip
theyre
hoping
here
that
most
crooks
will
remain
stupid
feel
safe
using
clipper
chip
phones
and
get
caught
