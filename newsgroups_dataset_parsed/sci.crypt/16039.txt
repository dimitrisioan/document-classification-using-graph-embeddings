WRITES
A
PERSON
I
KNOW
BELONGING
TO
A
RESEARCH
LAB
OF
A
RIVATE
COMPANY
CLAIMED
TO
ME
DURING
A
PRIAVTE
CONVERSATION
THAT
GIVEN
THE
EQUIPMENT
IN
HIS
LAB
HE
COULD
CRACK
A
KERBEROS
TICKET
IN
MINUTES
TO
AN
HOUR
HE
HAD
ACCESS
TO
RATHER
POWERFUL
DES
HARDWARE
BUT
NOT
OF
AN
EXTRAORDINARE
KIND
I
BELIEVE
THE
ATTACK
WAS
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
AMOUNT
OF
KNOWN
PLAINTEXT
IN
THE
TICKET
WHICH
ITSELF
CONSTITUTES
A
SMALL
MESSAGE
THIS
WAS
TWO
YEARS
AGO
I
DONT
BELIEVE
YOU
AND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
YOUR
FRIEND
WHY
BECAUSE
DES
IS
NOT
KNOWN
TO
HAVE
ANY
KNOWN
PLAINTEXT
ATTACKS
READILY
AVAILBLE
UNLESS
YOUR
FRIEND
KNOWS
SOMETHING
AND
IS
KEEPING
IT
SECRET
HE
WAS
BULLSHITTING
YOU
NOW
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
HE
NOTED
A
WEAKNESS
IN
THE
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
THE
KERBEROS
PROTOCOL
FOR
INSTANCE
USING
A
WEAK
RNG
TO
GENERATE
KEYS
MIGHT
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
KEYSPACE
NOT
FOR
THE
USER
KEYS
FOR
THE
OTHER
KIND
WHOS
NAME
I
CANT
REMEMBER
HOWEVER
THIS
IS
NOT
WHAT
WAS
CLAIMED
YOU
ARE
CLAIMING
A
GENERAL
WEAKNESS
IN
DES
WHICH
IS
NOT
KNOWN
TO
EXIST
IN
THE
OPEN
LITERATURE
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
DES
IS
WEAKER
THAN
IT
SHOULD
BE
HOWEVER
CRACKING
IT
IN
MINUTES
REQUIRES
MORE
MONEY
BE
SPENT
ON
THE
CRACKING
MACHINE
THAN
ANY
ORGANIZATION
