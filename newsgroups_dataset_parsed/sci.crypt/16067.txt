the
fact
that
the
nsa
is
listening
may
affect
your
willingness
to
use
wimpy
crypto
technologies
but
it
may
also
affect
your
willingness
to
use
technologies
that
violate
rsas
patents
eg
if
you
use
pgp
the
nsa
may
tell
rsa
that
youre
doing
so
and
if
the
secret
service
catches
on
im
afraid
i
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
point
nsa
will
not
tell
rsa
or
any
other
nondod
entity
anything
that
its
eavesdropping
reveals
that
includes
the
fbi
and
secrect
service
although
there
have
been
rare
exceptions
