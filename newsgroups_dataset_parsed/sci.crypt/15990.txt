WASHINGTON

DEAR
SECRETARY
BROWN
AS
YOU
KNOW
I
HAVE
LONG
BEEN
INTERESTED
IN
THE
PRIVACY
AND
SECURITY
OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
TRANSMISSIONS
AND
DATA
IN
A
NETWORKED
ENVIRONMENT
RECENT
REPORTS
CONCERNING
THE
ADMINISTRATIONS
ENDORSEMENT
OF
AN
ELECTRONIC
ENCRYPTION
STANDARD
BASED
UPON
CLIPPER
CHIP
TECHNOLOGY
HAVE
RAISED
A
NUMBER
OF
RELATED
ISSUES
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COMPETITIVENESS
OF
US
HIGH
TECH
MANUFACTURERS
AND
THE
SOFTWARE
INDUSTRY
IS
A
KEY
FACTOR
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
CONSIDER
WHEN
ADDRESSING
ISSUES
OF
ENCRYPTION
AND
DATA
SECURITY
AS
THE
NATION
MOVES
FORWARD
IN
DEVELOPING
THE
NATIONAL
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE
SECURITY
OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
TRANSMISSIONS
AND
NETWORK
DATA
WILL
BE
AN
INCREASINGLY
IMPORTANT
FACTOR
FOR
PROTECTING
THE
PRIVACY
OF
USERS
THE
HACKER
COMMUNITY
CAN
COMPROMISE
THE
INTEGRITY
OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
TRANSMISSIONS
AND
DATABASES
LINKED
BY
THE
NETWORK
THE
PEOPLE
AND
BUSINESSES
THAT
USE
THE
NATIONS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
NETWORK
AND
THE
PERSONAL
COMPUTERS
LINKED
THROUGH
IT
INCREASINGLY
ARE
DEMANDING
THAT
INFORMATION
BE
PROTECTED
AGAINST
UNAUTHORIZED
ACCESS
ALTERATION
AND
THEFT
I
AM
CONCERNED
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATIONS
PLAN
MAY
MEAN
THAT
TO
REMAIN
COMPETITIVE
INTERNATIONALLY
US
COMPANIES
WOULD
BE
COMPELLED
TO
DEVELOP
TWO
PRODUCTS
ONE
FOR
US
GOVERNMENT
CUSTOMERS
AND
ANOTHER
FOR
PRIVATE
COMMERCIAL
USERS
WHO
MAY
WANT
A
HIGHER
ENCRYPTION
STANDARD
THIS
MAY
INADVERTENTLY
INCREASE
COSTS
TO
THOSE
US
COMPANIES
HOPING
TO
SERVE
BOTH
MARKETS
TO
ASSIST
THE
SUBCOMMITTEES
ANALYSIS
OF
THIS
ISSUE
PLEASE
RESPOND
TO
THE
FOLLOWING
QUESTIONS
HAS
THE

THE
NATURE

AND
HOW
SUCH

WILL
BE
CHOSEN
UNDER
THE
ADMINISTRATIONS
PLAN
WHAT
ENTITIES
WILL
BE
THE
HOLDERS
OF
THE
KEYS
TO
DECRYPT
SCRAMBLED
DATA
WHAT
PROCEDURES
OR
CRITERIA
WILL
THE
ADMINISTRATION
UTILIZE
TO
DESIGNATE
SUCH
KEY
HOLDERS
DOES
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
ENDORSED
BY
THE
ADMINISTRATION
CONTAIN
A
TRAP
DOOR
OR
BACK
DOOR
WHICH
COULD
ALLOW
AN
AGENCY
OR
ENTITY
OF
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TO
CRACK
THE
CODE
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
OVER
TIME
CHANGES
IN
TECHNOLOGIES
USED
FOR
COMMUNICATIONS
WILL
REQUIRE
NEW
TECHNIQUES
AND
ADDITIONAL
EQUIPMENT
HOW
WILL
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
ADAPT
TO
THE
RAPID
ADVANCEMENT
OF
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGY
WHAT
ADDITIONAL

WOULD
THE

ENCRYPTION
PLACE
ON
