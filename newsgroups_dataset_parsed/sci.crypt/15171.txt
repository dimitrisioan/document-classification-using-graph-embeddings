call
me
paranoid
but
this
is
the
same
kind
of
scare
story
which
dorothy
denning
was
citing
while
calling
for
the
limitation
of
cryptography
i
doubt
that
dd
is
behind
this
but
i
suspect
that
the
fbi
and
maybe
nsa
are
behind
dd
and
those
agencies
could
easily
be
mounting
a
nationwide
campaign
with
our
tax
dollars
to
build
up
public
outcry
against
digital
communication
especially
against
unbreakable
encrypted
communication
whats
going
on
here
havent
you
read
any
of
noam
chomskys
works
a
widely
used
information
net
outside
the
control
of
the
right
people
is
unthinkable
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
will
be
spent
to
wipe
it
out
sorry
regulate
and
order
it
once
the
major
media
and
poitical
powers
wake
up
to
the
efect
it
can
have
if
you
cant
be
bothered
reading
get
the
video
