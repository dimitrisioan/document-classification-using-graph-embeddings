in
the
clipper
case
a
representative
body
of
experts
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
audit
it
and
well
have
assurances
maybe
even
from
the
president
that
other
than
the
escrowed
keys
there
are
no
back
doors
while
some
may
not
have
confidence
in
that
i
am
not
among
them
wow
assurances
from
the
president
why
those
are
almost
as
good
as
campaign
promises
i
dont
see
why
anyone
wouldnt
have
confidence
in
those
i
dont
think
mr
clinton
can
even
understand
the
technical
details
of
the
clipper
encryption
scheme
so
his
assurances
are
of
no
value
at
al
if
he
gives
them
he
just
says
what
a
panel
of
experts
told
him
if
i
lived
in
the
usa
i
would
hope
those
experts
were
not
paid
by
the
