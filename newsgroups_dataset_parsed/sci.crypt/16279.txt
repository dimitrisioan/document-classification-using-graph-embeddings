WRITES
IF
I
WANT
TO
TALK
TO
SOMEONE
I
DONT
NEED
TO
HAVE
PREVIOUSLY
EXCHANGED
KEYS
WITH
HIM
I
JUST
CALL
HIM
UP
AND
THE
PHONES
ESTABLISH
A
SESSION
KEY
FOR
US
USING
A
ZEROKNOWLEDGE
ALGORITHM
OR
SOMETHING
OF
THE
KIND
IF
IVE
MISUNDERSTOOD
THIS
PART
IT
PROBABLY
INVALIDATES
THE
REST
OF
THIS
NOTION
THIS
LENDS
ITSELF
TO
SPOOFING
I
GO
BUY
A
PAIR
OF
CLIPPER
PHONES
TO
GO
ON
A
PAIR
OF
PHONE
LINES
IN
A
BACK
ROOM
SOMEWHERE
AND
HAVE
THE
DIGITAL
SWITCH
PROGRAMMED
TO
REDIRECT
HIS
CALLS
TO
ONE
OF
MY
TWO
LINES
INSTEAD
OF
TO
HIS
WHENEVER
HE
RECEIVES
A
CALL
THE
TWO
PHONES
ARE
WIRED
BACKTOBACK
IN
THE
CLEAR
ANYONE
SEE
ANY
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
SCHEME
OTHER
THAN
TO
ASSUME
THAT
ALL
PUBLIC
OFFICIALS
AND
PHONE
COMPANY
EMPLOYEES
ARE
TOTALLY
INCORRUPTIBLE
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
NO
MATTER
HOW
THE
SESSION
KEYS
ARE
GENERATED
BE
IT
DIFFIEHELLMAN
OR
WHATEVER
ANY
CRIPPLE
CONVERSATION
WHICH
TRAVELS
IN
WHOLE
OR
IN
PART
OVER
A
LANDLINE
IS
VULNERABLE
TO
THIS
SCHEME
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
CAN
DO
IT
LEGALLY
AT
THE
TELCO
OR
ILLEGALLY
BY
FINDING
SOME
PART
OF
THE
PHONE
LINE
THAT
THEY
CAN
CUT
INTO
THE
DEGREE
OF
RISK
DEPENDS
VERY
MUCH
ON
LOCATION
NOT
GOOD
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
BUSY
STREET
BUT
NOT
BAD
ON
A
LINE
IN
OPEN
COUNTRY
LEADING
TO
A
DRUG
LORDS
RANCH
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
DEFEAT
IT
WOULD
BE
IF
YOUR
PHONE
HAD
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
A
PUBLIC
KEY
INDEXED
AGAINST
PHONE
NUMBER
FOR
EVERY
PHONE
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
CALL
ALL
OF
THEM
TOTALLY
IMPRACTICAL
EVEN
IF
SOME
PART
OF
THE
CRIPPLE
ALGORITHM
COULD
BE
USED
AS
A
KIND
OF
PUBLIC
KEY
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
ENOUGH
ABOUT
THESE
THINGS
TO
KNOW
THIS
SORT
OF
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
IS
ONLY
REALLY
WORKABLE
OVER
A
RADIO
LINK
AND
EVEN
THEN
YOU
COULD
PROBABLY
INTEREVENE
WITHOUT
CAUSING
PROBLEMS
FOR
OTHER
PHONES
NEARBY
IF
YOU
WERE
PHYSICALLY
CLOSE
TO
THE
TARGET
PHONE
GOSH
YET
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
GET
ROUND
CRIPPLE
ENCRYPTION
HOW
MANY
IS
THAT
WEVE
FOUND
SO
FAR
AND
THATS
WITHOUT
EVEN
KNOWING
THE
DETAILS

ALGORITHM
