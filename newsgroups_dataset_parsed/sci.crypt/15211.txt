KEEPING
YOUR

VINCE
KUB
WRITES
NOW
THE
ORIGINAL
SCHEME
AS
SUGGESTED
HERE
WOULD
BE
TO
HAVE
THE
KEY
DISAPPEAR
IF
CERTAIN
THREATENING
CONDITIONS
ARE
MET
ONCE
THE
KEY
IS
GONE
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
OF
CONTEMPT
OF
COURT
AS
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
COMPELL
THE
KEY
IS
NO
LONGER
THERE
TO
BE
PRODUCED
GETTING
RID
OF
THE
KEYS
IS
ACTUALLY
PRETTY
EASY
TO
DO
AUTOMATICALLY
ON
A
COMMUNICATIONS
LINK
AS
OPPOSED
TO
STORAGE
WHERE
THE
KEYS
HAVE
TO
BE
RETAINED
SOMEHOW
AS
LONG
AS
THE
OWNER
WANTS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
RETRIEVE
THE
DATA
THE
RIGHT
WAY
TO
DO
COMMUNICATIONS
SECURITY
IS
TO
GENERATE
A
RANDOM
SESSION
KEY
WITH
DIFFIE
HELLMAN
USE
IT
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
THEN
DESTROY
IT
ONCE
ITS
GONE
THERES
NO
GETTING
IT
BACK
AND
NO
WAY
TO
DECRYPT
RECORDINGS
OF
THE
CONVERSATION
TO
MAKE
SURE
YOU
ARENT
BEING
ATTACKED
BY
A
MAN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
YOU
HAVE
TO
AUTHENTICATE
YOUR
DH
EXCHANGES
THE
ATT
SECURE
PHONE
DOES
THIS
BY
DISPLAYING
THE
DH
KEY
SO
YOU
CAN
COMPARE
THEM
VERBALLY
OVER
THE
PHONE
THIS
IS
NICE
AND
SIMPLE
BUT
IT
RELIES
ON
USER
AWARENESS
PLUS
THE
INABILITY
OF
THE
MAN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
TO
DUPLICATE
THE
USERS
VOICES
A
BETTER
WAY
IS
TO
AUTHENTICATE
THE
EXCHANGES
WITH
RSA
SINCE
YOUD
NEVER
USE
RSA
FOR
ACTUAL
ENCRYPTION
COMPROMISING
YOUR
RSA
SECRET
KEY
WOULD
ONLY
ALLOW
SOMEONE
TO
IMPERSONATE
YOU
IN
A
FUTURE
CONVERSATION
AND
EVEN
THAT
ONLY
UNTIL
YOU
REVOKE
YOUR
PUBLIC
KEY
THEY
WOULD
STILL
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
DECRYPT
RECORDINGS
OF
PRIOR
CONVERSATIONS
FOR
WHICH
THE
SESSION
KEYS
HAVE
BEEN
DESTROYED
IM
CONVINCED
THAT
THIS
IS
HOW
THE
GOVERNMENTS
OWN
SECURE
PHONES
THE
STUIII
MUST
WORK
NEAT
EH
