TIMOTHY

MAY
WRITES
BUT
IS
IT
ANY
WORSE
THAN
THE
CURRENT
UNSECURE
SYSTEM
IT
BECOMES
MUCH
WORSE
OF
COURSE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
THEN
USES
THIS
CLINTON
CLIPPER
TO
ARGUE
FOR
RESTRICTIONS
ON
UNAPPROVED
ENCRYPTION
THIS
IS
THE
MAIN
CONCERN
OF
MOST
OF
US
I
THINK
THE
CAMELS
NOSE
IN
THE
TENT
ETC
NOT
TO
PICK
ON
MR
MAY
IN
PARTICULAR
OF
COURSE
BUT
ISNT
THIS
KIND
OF
THE
DOMINO
THEORY
AS
JOHN
GILMORE
HAS
POINTED
OUT
REPEATEDLY
IF
YOU
PRODUCE
THE
INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT
WOULD
PERMIT
A
POLICE
STATE
TO
FUNCTION
ALL
THAT
IS
REQUIRED
TO
SUDDENLY
FIND
YOURSELF
LIVING
IN
ONE
IS
A
CHANGE
OF
ATTITUDE
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
OUR
CONSTITUTION
WAS
BUILT
BY
MEN
WHO
HAD
TO
RISK
THEIR
LIVES
TO
ENSURE
FREEDOM
IN
OUR
COUNTRY
THEY
DESIGNED
THE
SYSTEM
TO
MAKE
IT
DIFFICULT
FOR
TYRANNY
TO
ARISE
FOR
INSTANCE
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
THE
FOURTH
AMENDMENT
WAS
PUT
THERE
WAS
TO
MAKE
IT
HARDER
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
TRY
TO
MAKE
SMUGGLING
A
CRIME
THINK
I
JEST
JOHN
HANCOCK
MADE
ALL
HIS
MONEY
SMUGGLING
RUM
WHICH
IS
AFTER
ALL
A
DRUG
THINK
ABOUT
IT
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
EVERYONES
KEYS
IN
ESCROW
AND
THE
FBI
GETS
THEIR
PET
WIRETAP
WITHOUT
LEAVING
THE
OFFICE
SCHEME
THERE
IS
A
COUP
WHICH
HAPPENS
EVERY
DAY
ALL
AROUND
THE
WORLD
WITHIN
HOURS
EVERYONE
IN
THE
COUNTRY
WHO
MIGHT
OPPOSE
THE
TYRANTS
IS
BEING
MONITORED
MORE
CLOSELY
THAN
EVER
BEFORE
POSSIBLE
WITHOUT
THE
TOOLS
BEING
IN
PLACE
A
TYRANNY
CANNOT
STAND
WITH
TOOLS
LIKE
THIS
IN
PLACE
A
TYRANNICAL
DICTATORSHIP
COULD
ACTUALLY
BE
SUCCESSFULLY
IMPOSED
WHY
GIVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TOOLS
WITH
WHICH
TO
ENSLAVE
YOU
MAYBE
YOU
CAN
TRUST
BILL
CLINTON
BUT
ARE
YOU
WILLING
TO
TELL
ME
THAT
YOU
CAN
TRUST
EVERY
GOVERNMENT
THAT
WILL
EVER
ARISE
IN
THE
US
HEREAFTER
I
AM
NOT
WILLING
TO
MAKE
THAT
LEAP
OF
FAITH
TIM
MAY
WHOSE
SIG
BLOCK
MAY
GET
HIM
BUSTED
IN
THE
NEW
REGIME
ISNT
THIS
JUST
A
LITTLE
MELODRAMATIC
IM
A
POLITICAL
DISSIDENT
AS
SUCH
I
AM
ACUTELY
AWARE
OF
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
POLITICAL
DISSIDENTS
IN
MOST
OF
THE
WORLD
IN
MOST
OF
THE
WORLD
I
COULD
BE
KILLED
FOR
MY
BELIEFS
CALL
AMNESTY
INTERNATIONAL
SOME
TIME
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
DISSIDENTS
IN
MOST
OF
THE
WORLD
ALL
THAT
SEPERATES
THE
US
FROM
MOST
OF
THOSE
PLACES
IS
A
THIN
PIECE
OF
PARCHMENT
IN
THE
NATIONAL
ARCHIVES
THATS
BEING
CONSTANTLY
MORE
AND
MORE
ERODED
BY
SUCH
FARCES
AS
THE
WAR
ON
DRUGS
COUPS
HAVE
HAPPENED
IN
COUNTRIES
THAT
HAVE
HAD
STABLE
DEMOCRACIES
FOR
OVER
A
HUNDRED
YEARS
GOVERNMENTS
THROUGHOUT
HISTORY
HAVE
FALLEN
NO
GOVERNMENT
HAS
LASTED
FOR
MORE
THAN
A
FEW
HUNDRED
YEARS
OFTEN
THEY
ARE
REPLACED
BY
DICTATORSHIPS
DO
YOU
REALLY
BELIEVE
SO
INTENSELY
THAT
IT
COULD
NEVER
EVER
EVER
HAPPEN
HERE
THAT
YOU
ARE
WILLING
TO
BET
YOUR
OWN
LIFE
AND
THE
LIVES
OF
YOUR
CHILDREN
AND
OTHER
LOVED
ONES
ON
IT
IF
WE
CONSTRUCT
THE
TOOLS
WITH
WHICH
TYRANNY
COULD
BE
ENFORCED
WE
MAKE
IT
ORDERS
OF
MAGNITUDE
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
IT
COULD
HAPPEN
BECAUSE
IF
IT
HAPPENED
WITH
THE
TOOLS
ALREADY
IN
PLACE
IT
COULD
ACTUALLY
STICK
NAIVE
FOOLS
SUCH
AS
OUR
LEADERSHIP
BELIEVE
THEY
CAN
PROTECT
US
WHERE
HUNDREDS
THAT
HAVE
GONE
BEFORE
HAVE
FAILED
THRIVING
DEMOCRACIES
LED
BY
MEN
FAR
MORE
SKILLFULL
THAN
BILL
CLINTON
HAVE
FALLEN
TO
DICTATORSHIP
ROME
HAD
A
THRIVING
REPUBLIC
RUN
BY
EXQUISITELY
SKILLED
MEN
BEFORE
THEY
BECAME
A
TYRANNY
I
FOR
ONE
AM
UNWILLING
TO
TRUST
THAT
IT
COULD
NEVER
HAPPEN
HERE
ONLY
HUBRIS
WOULD
ALLOW
US
TO
BELIEVE
WE
ARE
IMMUNE
