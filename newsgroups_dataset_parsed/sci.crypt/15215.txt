CLIPPER
STUFF
AS
OF
YET
THERE
HAS
BEEN
NO
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
GENERAL
PRINCIPLES
BEHIND
THE
CLIPPER
PROPOSAL
FOR
EXAMPLE
IS
THIS
A
PUBLIC
KEY
SYSTEM
OR
A
PRIVATE
KEY
SYSTEM
IF
THE
LATTER
THEN
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
THE
SYSTEM
COULD
WORK
GIVEN
THAT
THE
KEYS
ARE
TIED
TO
THE
DEVICE
AND
NOT
THE
PERSON
FURTHER
THE
ESCROWED
KEYS
ARE
SPLIT
INTO
TWO
CHUNKS
I
WOULD
GUESS
THAT
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
ONE
OF
THESE
CHUNKS
AND
A
REASONABLE
KEYSEARCH
MACHINE
WOULD
ALLOW
YOU
TO
READ
THE
TRAFFIC
IM
NOT
SUGGESTING
THAT
THIS
IS
A
DELIBERATE
WEAKNESS
OF
THE
SYSTEM
BUT
IT
DOES
MAKE
YOU
THINK
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
EASILY
FIXABLE
BY
GIVING
OUT
TWO
CHUNKS
WHICH
COULD
BE
XORED
TO
GENERATE
THE
REAL
KEY
