ive
recently
been
reading
a
paper
of
merkles
publixhed
only
on
the
net
i
think
discussing
three
potential
replacements
for
des
was
anyting
ever
done
with
these
are
khufu
khafre
andor
snefru
still
being
discussed
anywhere
i
know
snefru
is
referenced
in
the
rsa
faq
and
i
think
it
may
also
be
in
the
scicrypt
faq
the
paper
was
distributed
against
the
wishes
of
the
nsa
i
have
a
copy
with
a
few
illicit
distribution
footnotes
scribbled
on
it
and
eventually
published
at
one
of
the
crypto
conferences
things
were
looking
good
then
xerox
patented
the
algorithms
plonk
i
dont
know
of
anything
which
uses
them
also
khafre
was
broken
at
a
later
conference
and
from
work
on
a
related
algorithm
i
dont
think
the
existing
khufu
would
hold
up
too
well
against
a
converted
differential
cryptanalysis
attack
although
it
can
probably
be
changed
to
resist
this
type
of
attack
peter
in
case
you
dont
know
what
the
plonk
is
about
check
the
new
hackers
dictionary
its
the
sound
someone
makes
when
they
fall
to
the
bottom
of
a
killfile
