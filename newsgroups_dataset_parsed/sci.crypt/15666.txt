so
dont
just
think
of
replacements
for
clipper
also
think
of
front
ends
this
only
makes
sense
if
the
government
prohibits
alternative
nonescrowed
encryption
schemes
otherwise
why
not
just
use
the
front
end
without
clipper
because
that
will
make
private
encryption
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
and
the
government
will
start
to
take
a
sharp
interest
in
everything
you
