WRITES
I
AM
A
CONSERVEATIVE
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
A
LAW
AND
ORDER
CONSERVEATIVE
BUT
THE
MOVE
TO
A
CENTRALIZED
AUTHORATARIAN
REGIME
REALLY
SCARES
ME
MOSTLY
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
YOU
CANT
GO
FAR
WRONG
UNDERESTIMATING
THE
INTELLIGENCE
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
TELL
THEM
ITS
GOING
TO
KEEP
THEM
SAFE
FROM
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
TERRORISTS
AND
THEY
WILL
LET
YOU
PUT
CAMERAS
IN
THEIR
HOME
THERE
IS
ONE
POINT
ID
LIKE
TO
MAKE
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
HAVE
FORGOTTEN
THAT
IS
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
UNDERLINING
PRINCIPLES
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
IS
A
DISTRUST
OF
GOVERNMENTAL
AUTHORITY
AND
CONTROL
ALL
THOSE
CHECKS
BALANCES
IS
BECAUSE
THEY
REALIZE
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
DISTRUST
THOSE
IN
POWER
WHAT
EVERYONE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
FORGOTTEN
AS
WELL
IS
THE
ORIGINAL
REASON
THAT
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
GUARANTEED
THE
RIGHT
TO
BEAR
ARMS
ITS
INCLUSION
WAS
NOT
TO
ALLOW
YOU
TO
PROTECT
YOURSELF
AGAINST
OTHER
CITIZENS
BUT
TO
PREVENT
THE
GOVERNMENT
FROM
TAKING
AWAY
YOUR
ONLY
MEANS
OF
PROTECTING
YOURSELF
FROM
AN
ARMED
AND
AGGRESSIVE
GOVERNMENT
ITS
HARD
TO
OPPRESS
YOUR
CITIZENRY
WHEN
ITS
ARMED
AGAINST
YOU
I
AM
NOT
A
FANATIC
IM
A
RETIRED
NAVAL
OFFICER
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
SPENT
SO
MUCH
TIME
DEFENDING
IT
PERHAPS
I
UNDERSTAND
ITS
PURPOSE
AS
WELL
AS
ITS
PLAN
