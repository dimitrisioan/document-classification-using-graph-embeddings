your

looks
normal

perhaps
anyone
desiring

listen
in
wont
even
bother
since
they
know
nobodys
going
to
really
trust
crypto
that
has
classified
internals
for
important
stuff
nice
to
think
but
naive
the
fact
is
that
millions
of
people
today
are
sending
highly
confidential
information
over
unencoded
easy
to
receive
cellular
phones
they
figure
the
chances
of
being
heard
are
small
so
they
risk
it
and
of
people
dont
understand
crypto
the
way
the
least
of
the
scicrypt
newbies
does
if
clinton
tells
them
its
good
crypto
theyll
believe
him
and
send
important
stuff
over
it
and
be
thankful
that
theyre
no
longer
using

fm
cellular

only
a
tiny
fraction
of
people
will
want
more
crypto
worse
in
the

of
the
government
which
swears
up

down
the

and
it
may
indeed
be
the
only
reason
you
could
possibly
want
this
extra

is
to
avoid
police
by
using
it
youll
attract
attention
as
a
likely
lawbreaker
your
honour
the
suspect
suddenly
started
using
another
