re
how
to
detect
use
of
an
illegal
cipher
as
for
my
impressions
of
the
whole
scheme
it
seems
that
instead
of
trying
to
ban
strong
crypto
they
are
trying
to
coopt
it
their
contention
that
they
need
to
keep
the
algorythm
secret
to
protect
the
security
of
the
key
registration
suggests
possible
inherent
weakness
to
the
algorythm
more
likely
is
that
they
dont
want
anyone
constructing
black
market
devices
which
dont
have
the
keys
registered
anyone
else
notice
that
in
their
qa
session
they
preventing
black
market
chips
wnonescrowed
keys
is
exactly
what
they
mean
by
protecting
the
security
of
the
key
escrow
system
there
are
two
parts
to
the
security
of
such
a
system
a
preventing
decruption
by
unauthorized
personel
b
assuring
that
the
gummit
can
always
decrypt
clipper
traffic
when
it
authorizes
itself
to
do
so
of
course
the
ministry
of
propoganda
will
do
a
lot
of
tallking
about
a
and
very
little
about
b
rob
boudrie
rboudriechpcorg
ps
anyone
care
to
guess
what
encryption
scheme
the
govt
is
using
on
its
newly
formed
database
of
anarchcryptists
who
oppose
this
entire
lunacy
