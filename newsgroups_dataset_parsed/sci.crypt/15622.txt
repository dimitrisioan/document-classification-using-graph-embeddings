re
off
the
shelf
cheap
des
keyseach
machine
was
re
corporate
acceptance
of
the
wiretap
chip
i
mean
if
we
can
imagine
the
machine
that
does
trialnanosecond

can

the
storage
medium
that
could
index
and
archive
it
i
think
youd
have
to
do
some
massive
data
compression
just
to
fit
a
bit
of
key
information
on
each
primary
particle
of
the
known
universe
but
hey
its
fun
to
imagine
