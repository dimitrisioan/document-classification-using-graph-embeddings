SUMMARY
RESPONSES
RESEARCH
ON
ORACLE
PASSWORD
SECURITY
MY
ORIGINAL
POST
WAS
I
AM
BUILDING
AN
ORACLE
DATABASE
TO
SERVE
AS
A
REPOSITORY
FOR
INFORMATION
WHICH
IS
CONSIDERED
PROPRIETARY
OR
CONFIDENTIAL
AS
SUCH
I
WANT
TO
VERIFY
THE
SECURITY
OF
ORACLE
PASSWORDS
AND
APPLY
SOME
OF
THE
SAME
SECURITY
CHECKING
TECHNIQUES
WE
USE
ON
OUR
NIX
SYSTEMS
SPECIFICALLY
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
USE
CRACK
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
IT
TO
CHECK
THE
ENCRYPTED
DATA
FOR
EASILY
GUESSED
PASSWORDS
THE
USE
OF
CRACK
WOULD
DEPEND
ON
ORACLE
USING
THE
UNIX
PASSWORD
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
OR
WHAT
METHOD
IS
USED
ANY
OTHER
METHODS
FOR
SECURITY
CHECKING
AUDIT
IN
THE
ORACLE
ENVIRONMENT
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
THIS
ARTICLE
WILL
JUST
SCRATCH
THE
SURFACE
OF
A
FEW
SECURITY
CONSIDERATIONS
COMMENTS
ARE
REQUESTED

MY
THANKS
TO
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
RESPONDED
BOTH
ON
USENET
AND
FROM
ORACLE
CORP
THE
MOST
COMMON
RESPONSE
WAS
TO
SUGGEST
USE
OF
ORACLE
AUDIT
FEATURES
OR
OPS
PASSWORDS
TO
CONTROL
ACCESS
OPINION
ON
OPS
INCLUDED
SUGGESTIONS
TO
USE
AND
NOT
USE
I
WAS
ALSO
ADVISED
TO
USE
TABLE
VIEWS
TO
REFINE
THE
GRANULARITY
OF
ACCESS
CONTROL
ONE
IMPORTANT
SECURITY
CONSIDERATION
IN
NETWORKED
INSTALLATIONS
IS
THAT
OPS
ACCOUNTS
PRESUME
THAT
THE
CLIENT
HOST
PROVIDES
USER
AUTHENTICATION
SERVER
OPS
USERS
ARE
ONLY
AS
SECURE
AS
THE
LEAST
SECURE
MACHINE
ON
THE
NETWORK
HENCE
YOU
SHOULD
PROBABLY
NOT
DEFINE
ANY
OPS
ACCOUNTS
ON
SYSTEMS
WITH
PCS
OR
LIMIT
ACCESS
OF
OPS
ACCOUNTS
TO
DATA
WITH
NO
SECURITY
CONCERNS
UNIX
ORACLE
SERVERS
PROVIDE
FOR
DISABLING
OPS
ACCESS
OVER
THE
NETWORK
ORASRV
OPTION
WHILE
RELYING
ON
HOST
SECURITY
FOR
LOCAL
PROCESSES
INTERNALLY
ORACLE
PROVIDES
POWERFUL
AND
WELL
DOCUMENTED
SIC
AUDIT
MECHANISMS
WHICH
THE
DBA
WILL
USE
TO
MONITOR
SYSTEM
AND
DATA
ACCESS
THESE
TOOLS
CAN
BE
USED
TO
TRACK
THE
PRIMARY
SECURITY
RISKS
FROM
WITHIN
THE
ORACLE
ENVIRONMENT
ORACLE
PASSWORD
SECURITY
IS
BASED
ON
A
PROPRIETARY
USAGE
OF
DES
ENCRYPTION
ORACLE
CORP
STATES
THAT
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
NOT
PRONE
TO
CLEARTEXT
ATTACK
THIS
IS
A
DIFFICULT
CLAIM
TO
SUBSTANTIATE
SINCE
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
UNKNOWN
THE
CONCERN
HERE
IS
THAT
IF
USERS
CHOOSE
EASILY
GUESSED
PASSWORDS
IF
A
CRACKER
CAN
GAIN
ACCESS
TO
YOUR
ORACLE
DATABASE
FILES
THROUGH
THE
HOST
OPERATING
SYSTEM
SHE
COULD
EXTRACT
THE
CYPHERTEXT
PASSWORD
DATA
AND
APPLY
CRYPTANALYSIS
TECHNIQUES
TO
LEARN
THE
USERS
PASSWORDS
AS
SECURITY
RISKS
GO
THE
ABOVE
SCENARIO
IS
PRETTY
LOW
SEVERITY
CERTAINLY
ONCE
AN
INTRUDER
HAS
ACCESS
TO
THE
RAW
DATABASE
FILES
SHE
CAN
ACCESS
TO
THE
DATA
IN
THEM
IF
A
CRACKER
COULD
BREAK
THE
PASSWORDS
HOWEVER
SHE
COULD
DO
SUBSTANTIAL
DAMAGE
WITHOUT
ALERTING
THE
AUDITING
MECHANISMS
AND
LEAVING
AND
AUDIT
TRAIL
WHICH
WOULD
POINT
TO
VALID
USERS
AT
PRESENT
ORACLE
LIKE
UNIX
PROVIDES
NO
NATIVE
MEANS
OF
ENSURING
THAT
PASSWORDS
ARE
NOT
GUESSABLE
AS
WITH
ALL
COMPUTER
SECURITY
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
DEFENSE
IS
TO
EDUCATE
USERS
IN
THE
SAFE
CHOICE
OF
PASSWORDS
THESE
TECHNIQUES
ARE
WELL
DISCUSSED
IN
INTERNET
AND
THE
CRACK
MANUAL
BOTH
AVAILABLE
FROM
FTP
