i
noticed
a
rather
disturbing
trend
in
some
of
the
email
and
posts
ive
tossing
back
and
forth
me
too
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
some
people
to
hide
their
head
in
the
sand
i
never
advocated
hiding
in
the
sand
im
advocating
a
peaceful
solution
while
a
peaceful
solution
is
possible
unless
you
want
blood
on
your
hands
how
many
people
do
you
want
jailed
for
their
convictions
for
their
insistence
on
real
privacy
why
sit
by
quietly
while
the
preconditions
for
a
real
civil
war
are
put
in
place
by
a
shortsighted
government
read
the
above
everybody
is
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going
to
reach
for
their
hammers
and
rifles
before
their
pens
and
paper
the
terminal
is
mightier
than
the
pen
i
type
corrected
really
i
guess
you
mean
the
us
revolution
how
about
england
india
mexico
france
holland
english
revolution
what
revolution
they
never
had
one
india
if
they
could
get
around
their
religion
restrictions
mexico
point
taken
i
forgot
about
this
one
france
napoleon
bonepart
would
have
something
to
say
about
this
holland
i
didnt
know
they
had
one
wont
comment
because
i
dont
know
enough
thats
not
very
good
odds
you
are
misinformed
but
this
whole
issue
is
off
the
topic
actually
i
consider
the
issue
on
topic
when
you
start
gambling
with
fire
crackers
sooner
or
later
somebody
is
going
to
lose
a
hand
when
the
cops
kick
in
your
door
for
using
pgp
tell
them
that
all
were
doing
here
is
exercising
our
socalled
rapidly
narrowing
right
to
free
speech
fine
exercise
the
right
to
free
speech
thats
great
but
dont
resort
to
armed
violence
until
theres
no
other
possibility
perhaps
you
should
talk
to
the
government
about
that
or
are
you
a
disciple
of
david
the
cops
are
our
friends
sternlight
no
i
believe
there
are
bad
cops
and
good
cops
there
are
bad
people
and
good
people
and
all
that
grey
inbetween
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
a
police
officer
who
did
his
best
to
uphold
the
laws
he
swore
to
defend
i
have
also
seen
what
happens
when
police
power
is
abused
dont
generalize
in
either
direction
it
just
causes
problems
the
implied
threat
of
the
illegalization
of
private
crypto
the
notsosubtle
subtext
of
the
clipper
announcement
is
what
worries
me
i
dont
want
my
children
growing
up
in
a
police
state
