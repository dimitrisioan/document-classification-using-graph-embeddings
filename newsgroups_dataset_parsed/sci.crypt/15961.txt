WRITES
TWO
SAFEGUARDS
THE
FBI
COULD
BE
ASKED
TO
PRODUCE
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
BLOCK
TO
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
AND
ASSOCIATE
IT
WITH
A
PARTICULAR
COURT
ORDER
EXACTLY
WHAT
WOULD
THAT
SHOW
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
BLOCK
IS
EASY
TO
CREATE
GIVEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
KEY
AND
ANY
SERIAL
NUMBER
IF
THE
THING
COMES
TO
TRIAL
THE
DEFENSE
ATTORNEYS
CAN
PROBE
THIS
ISSUE
CLOSELY
IT
IS
NOT
TOO
DIFFERENT
FROM
PROVING
THAT
THE
SPEAKER
ON
A
LEGAL
WIRETAP
IS
THE
PERSON
THE
COURT
ORDER
COVERED
IF
IT
COMES
TO
TRAIL
ABOUT
THE
WIRETAP
YA
SOME
SAFEGAURD
THAT
IS
WHAT
IF
THEY
JUST
HARASS
PEOPLE
AS
A
RESULT
OR
LEARN
THINGS
THEY
SHOULDNT
HAVE
LEARNED
ETC
PUTTING
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
THIS
QUESTION
IS
NOT
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
PRECLIPPER
QUESTION
WHATS
TO
PREVENT
THE
FBI
FROM
GETTING
A
COURT
ORDER
TO
TAP
AL
CAPONE
AND
THEN
USING
IT
TO
TAP
JONATHAN
LIVINGSTONE
SEAGULL
INSTEAD
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
THE
ESCROW
SYSTEM
IS
TO
PREVENT
THE
FBI
FROM
MAKING
ILLEGAL
WIRETAPS
WHY
NOT
HAVE
THE
FBI
HOLDS
THE
KEYS
AND
THATS
IT
WHY
DO
WE
NEED
THE
ESCROW
SYSTEM
AT
ALL
UNLESS
A
PARTY
A
JUDGE
VERIFIES
THAT
THE
REQUESTED
SERIAL
NUMBER
IS
RIGHT
AND
THE
FBI
CAN
GET
ANY
KEY
THEY
LIKE
AT
ANYTIME
THE
ESCROW
SYSTEM
IS
USELESS
