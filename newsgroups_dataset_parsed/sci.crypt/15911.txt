RE
DO
WE
NEED
THE
CLIPPER
FOR
CHEAP
SECURITY
THERE
ARE
CHIPS
WHICH
PERFORM
THE
VOICE
COMPRESSIONEXPANSION
THEY
CANT
BE
EXPENSIVE
BECAUSE
THEY
EXIST
IN
MANY
PHONES
CONNECTED
TO
PBXS
OR
ON
THE
PBX
LINE
CARDS
AS
WELL
AS
IN
A
LOT
OF
EQUIPMENT
WHICH
COMPRESSES
VOICEGRADE
CIRCUITS
TO
SAVE
THE
COST
OF
LONGDISTANCE
LEASED
OR
SATELLITE
CIRCUITS
I
CANT
REMEMBER
THE
GENERIC
TERM
FOR
THESE
CHIPS
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
BIG
DEAL
YEARS
AGO
BUT
CIRCUITS
HAVE
GOTTEN
SO
CHEAP
THAT
IT
ISNT
DONE
MUCH
NOW
CODECS
THEY
HAVE
TO
GET
ABOUT
COMPRESSION
ON
BIT
SAMPLES
TO
SQUEEZE
THEM
DOWN
I
PLAYED
AROUND
WITH

IT
ONLY
MANAGED
IVE
GOT
SOME
SPECIMEN

CODE
BUT
ITS
NOT
OBVIOUS
THAT
IT
RUNS
IN

I
THINK
ITS
JUST
PROOFOF
CONCEPT
CODE
AND
I
HAVE
SOME
MUCKING
ABOUT
WITH
FILE
FORMATS
TO
DO
BEFORE
I
CAN
PUT
MY
OWN
SAMPLE
THROUGH
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THE
CURRENT
OPTION
IS
TO
USE
A
VOICEMAIL
MODEM
WITH
BUILTIN
DSP
CHIP
TO
DO
THIS
IN
HARDWARE
THAT
MEANS
TWO
MODEMS
FOR
A
SYSTEM
PUTTING
THE
COST
AT
UPWARDS
OUCH
MAYBE
SOON
WELL
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
IT
IN
SOFTWARE
ON
HIGHPOWERED

CONSOLES
ISNT
THE
AN
