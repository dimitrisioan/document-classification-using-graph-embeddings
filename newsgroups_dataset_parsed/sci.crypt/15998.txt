CLIPPER
SCOPE
WAS
OVERREACTING

PAT
MYRTO
WRITES
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
HAVING
THE
SCOPE
OR
IMPLICATAIONS
POINTED
OUT
TO
THEM
HELL
MOST
HAVENT
EVEN
HEARD
OF
CLIPPER
AND
WHEN
THEY
DO
IT
WILL
BE
IN
SOOTHING
LANGUAGE
TELLING
EVERYONE
HOW
NICE
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
AT
LETTING
THEM
HAVE
PRIVACY
MUCH
MORE
DELETED
THE
PEOPLE
AT
LARGE
NEED
TO
BE
INFORMED
BUT
HOW
I
AM
BUT
ONE
PERSON
I
TRY
TO
TALK
TO
EVERYONE
THAT
WILL
LISTEN
BUT
I
CAN
HARDLY
MAKE
ANY
KIND
OF
DENT
HERE
IS
HOW
LETS
WRITE
A
DOCUMENT
WHICH
INCLUDES
ALL
THE
REASONS
WE
OPPOSE
CLIPPER
IN
CLEAR
CONCISE
NONTECHINCAL
MANNER
I
URGE
EVERYONE
OF
YOU
TO
TAKE
THE
VERY
SIMPLE
START
BELOW
AND
REPOST
IT
WITH
CHANGES
LET
THE
TEXT
EVOLVE
UNTIL
WE
REACH
SOMETHING
MOST
OF
US
LIKE
THEN
ALL
OF
YOU
SHOULD
SEND
A
COPY
WITH
A
PERSONNEL
LETTER
TO
YOUR
CONGRESS
CRITTER
LOCAL
REPORTER
ON
SCITECH
ETC
PLEASE
TO
MAKE
THIS
A
SUCCESS
TRY
TO
POST
ONLY
AN
AGREED
VERSION
NOT
FLAMES
TO
RESPOND
TO
A
FLAME
TO
THIS
PLEASE
CHANGE
THE
SUBJECT
TO
EG
CLIPPER
SCOPE
DISCUSSION
MICHAEL
GOLAN
MGCSPRINCETONEDU
ALL
OF
THESE
ARE
POINTS
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
MADE
INTO
PARAGRAPHS
WHAT
IS
WRONG
WITH
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
BY
USENET
USERS
IT
IS
SECRET
HOW
CAN
WE
TRUST
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
IT
IS
NOT
COSTEFFECTIVE
WE
WANT
OTHER
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEMS
THE
GOVERNMENT
SEEMS
TO
WANT
TO
DISALLOW
IT
IN
THE
FUTURE
ANYONE
CAN
BUILD
A
NONKEY
SYSTEM
WE
ARE
WORRIED
ABOUT
A
BACK
DOOR
ONCE
EVERYONE
USES
A
CLIPPER
CHIP
THE
MECHANISM
FOR
A
BIGBROTHER
GOVERNMENT
IS
IN
PLACE
A
CHANGE
OF
GOVERNMENT
CAN
LEAD
TO
IT
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
OPERATION
IS
NOT
GOVERNED
BY
LAW
SO
THE
PRESIDENT
CAN
CHANGE
THE
RULES
TO
ALLOW
FREE
ACCESS
TO
THE
KEYS
AT
ANY
TIME
EG
DURING
WAR
FEW
CRIMINALS
ARE
CAUGHT
BY
WIRETAPS
THE
COST
AND
RISKS
ARE
UNJUSTIFIED
ONCE
THE
FBI
GET
HOLD
OF
A
KEY
IT
CAN
DECRYPT
PAST
AND
FUTURE
CONVERSATIONS
