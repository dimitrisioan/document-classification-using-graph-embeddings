A
ROUGH

THAT

ARE
WORTH
ABOUT
FIVE
MILLION

STATISTICAL

IM
WORKING
ON
ESTIMATING
THIS
WIRETAP
BENEFIT
MORE
ACCURATELY
BUT
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
ASSUMING
THAT
ALL
ARRESTS
ARE
OF
EQUAL
VALUE
AND
THAT
THE
USE
OF
WIRETAPS
IS
SPREAD
UNIFORMLY
AMONG
THEM
GIVEN
THIS
COMPARATIVELY
TINY
NUMBER
OF
WIRETAPS
AND
THE
ASSOCIATED
DIFFICULTY
AND
COST
INVOLVED
JUDGES
TECHNICIANS
ETC
I
EXPECT
THAT
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
RESERVES
THE
USE
OF
WIRETAPS
FOR
THE
MOST
VALUABLE
CASES
SINCE
THE
VALUE
OF
AN
ARREST
CAN
VARY
OVER
AN
ENORMOUS
RANGE
EG
JAYWALKING
MASS
MURDER
I
THINK
YOUR
MILLION
ESTIMATE
MAY
BE
TOO
LOW
BY
A
COUPLE
OF
ORDERS
OF
MAGNITUDE
