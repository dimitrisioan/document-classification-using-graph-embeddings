LICENSING
THIS
THREAD
BRINGS
UP
THE
MORE
GENERAL
QUESTION
CAN
ANY
CRYPTO
IMPLEMENTATION
FOR
WHICH
HIGHLY
PUBLICLY
SCRUTINIZED
SOURCE
CODE
IS
NOT
AVAILABLE
EVER
BE
TRUSTED
AFTER
IBM
HAD
INVENTED
THE
DES
AND
THE
NBS
HAD
ADVERTISED
FOR
PROPOSALS
BUT
BEFORE
IBM
HAD
DECIDED
TO
RESPOND
I
ARGUED
STRENUOUSLY
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
THEY
SHOULD
KEEP
IT
PROPRIETARY
THE
BIGGEST
PROPONENT
OF
PROPOSING
WAS
DR
LEWIS
BRANSCOMB
DR
BRANSCOMB
WAS
THE
IBM
CHIEF
SCIENTIST
AND
HAD
COME
TO
IBM
FROM
NBS
FORTUNATELY
FOR
ALL
OF
US
DR
BRANSCOMB
UNDERSTOOD
THE
ANSWER
TO
THE
ABOVE
QUESTION
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
I
HE
REALIZED
HOW
DIFFICULT
IT
WOULD
BE
TO
GAIN
ACCEPTANCE
FOR
ANY
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
MECHANISM
BECAUSE
OF
THE
NECESSARY
COMPLEXITY
PUBLICITY
WOULD
NOT
BE
SUFFICIENT
AND
NEITHER
WOULD
AUTHORITY
IN
FACT
IT
HAS
TAKEN
BOTH
OF
THOSE
PLUS
MORE
THAN
YEARS
WE
HAVE
ALSO
HAD
INDEPENDENCE
THE
DES
WAS
SOLICITED
BY
NBS
INVENTED
AND
PROPOSED
BY
IBM
AND
VETTED
BY
NBS
IT
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
EXAMINED
AND
VETTED
BY
EXPERTS
LIKE
ADI
SHAMIR
WHO
ARE
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
INFLUENCE
BY
ANY
OF
THESE
EVEN
NOW
THERE
ARE
STILL
PEOPLE
POSTING
ON
THIS
LIST
WHO
DO
NOT
TRUST
THE
DES
IN
SPITE
OF
ALL
THE
TIME
ALL
OF
THE
ANALYSIS
AND
ALL
OF
THE
PUBLIC
SCRUTINY
OF
COURSE
IT
IS
JUST
THIS
POINT
THAT
NIST
MISSES
WHEN
IT
ATTEMPTS
TO
GAIN
ACCEPTANCE
FOR
A
NOVEL
MECHANISM
DEVELOPED
IN
SECRET
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
AUTHORITY
ALONE
WE
HAD
A
LONG
THREAD
HERE
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
NSA
CAN
BREAK
THE
DES
THAT
IS
A
SILLY
QUESTION
AT
SOME
COST
AND
IN
SOME
TIME
THEY
CAN
BREAK
ANYTHING
THE
IMPORTANT
QUESTION
IS
AT
WHAT
COST
AND
IN
WHAT
TIME
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
STRENGTH
OF
THE
DES
AND
RSA
ARE
NOT
NEARLY
SO
IMPORTANT
AS
WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
THEIR
STRENGTH
AS
LONG
AS
WE
UNDERSTAND
THE
COST
AND
DURATION
FOR
AN
ATTACKER
THEN
WE
CAN
USE
THEM
IN
A
SAFE
WAY
AT
THIS
POINT
WE
MAY
NEVER
REPLACE
EITHER
BECAUSE
OF
THE
INABILITY
OF
ANY
SUCCESSOR
TO
OVERCOME
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
GAP
DES
AND
RSA
ARE
AMONG
THE
MOST
SIGNIFICANT
INVENTIONS
OF
THE
CENTURY
AND
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
INVENTIONS
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
CRYPTOGRAPHY
WE
ARE
DAMNED
LUCKY
TO
HAVE
THEM
