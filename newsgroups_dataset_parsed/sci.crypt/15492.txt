the
clipper
chip
will
have
a
secret
crypto
algorithm
embedded
in
the
algorithm
operates
on
blocks
like
des
and
the
chip
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
the
algorithm
uses
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
in
des
so
in
a
few
years
there
could
be
millions
of
these
chips
in
the
usa
all
networked
together
sounds
like
a
good

fiction
story
the
government
wants
to
crack
foreign
des
or
whatever
messages
so
they
con
the
public
into
individually
buying
all
of
the

and
installing
them

the
us
could
be
covered
by
the
largest
