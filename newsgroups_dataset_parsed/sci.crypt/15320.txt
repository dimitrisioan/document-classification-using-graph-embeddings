the
system
is
vulnerable
to
simple
phone
swapping
attacks
like
this
criminals
will
quickly
figure
this
out
and
go
to
town
depends
its
possible
that
the
phone
sends
its
serial
number
in
the
clear
at
some
specified
interval
so
all
a
listener
needs
to
do
is
get
that
sn
and
then
get
the
key
for
it
so
swapping
phones
isnt
a
problem
for
the
govt
that
is
they
still
know
that
this
line
belongs
to
you
so
they
just
watch
the
line
and
see
the
sn
and
then
they
get
the
key
for
that
sn
in
either
case
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
this
a
bit
well
i
think
this
is
understood
the
major
problem
is
that
a
lot
of
people
just
dont
trust
this
key
escrow
stuff
and
the
fact
that
the
algorithms
are
classified
so
yes
a
lot
of
this
needs
to
be
looked
at
closer
