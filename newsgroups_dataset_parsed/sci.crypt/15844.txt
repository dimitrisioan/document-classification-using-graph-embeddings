send
something
to
rush
linbaugh
about
clinton
taking
away
our
right
to
privacy
and
how
if
the
govt
standard
takes
off
only
people
with
lots
of
money
drug
dealers
will
be
able
to
justify
des
stuff
he
will
slam
clinton
for
this
on
the
air
hell
slam
clinton
for
anything
at
all
on
the
air
i
just
do
not
understand
why
he
remains
so
popular
hell
take
a
piece
of
video
of
clinton
walking
along
find
a
frame
in
which
clinton
wrinkles
his
nose
say
freeze
on
it
and
blow
it
up
full
screen
and
then
rant
for
five
minutes
on
how
no
one
could
possibly
trust
someone
with
such
a
face
and
such
beady
greedy
little
eyes
ive
seen
this
on
his
tv
show
it
was
around
the
time
of
the
inauguration
can
anyone
call
this
stuff
legitimate
i
hate
to
say
informed
commentary
how
can
anyone
with
half
a
brain
in
his
or
her
continue
to
watch
the
american
tvwatching
and
i
guess
radiolistening
public
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
j
oops
have
i
just
inadvertently
answered
my
own
question
i
myself
only
see
it
when
i
run
across
it
every
couple
months
when
channelsurfing
late
at
night
the
longest
ive
been
able
to
stand
him
was
about
minutes
apologies
for
stripping
the
altfanrush
groups
from
the
newsgroups

the

here
apparently
rejects
anything
with
groups
we
dont
carry
and
we
dont
