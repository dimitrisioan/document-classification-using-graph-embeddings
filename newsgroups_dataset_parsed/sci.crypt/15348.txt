IN

ISNT
THIS
JUST
A
LITTLE
MELODRAMATIC
NOT
AT
ALL
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
REGISTERED
A
CONCERN
ABOUT
SOME
PROGRAMMING
THAT
WAS
BEING
CONDUCTED
BY
A
STUDENT
ORGANISATION
HERE
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
TEXAS
AT
SAN
ANTONIO
AS
A
RESULT
I
WAS
INTERROGATED
BY
THE
CAPUS
POLICE
WHO
ALSO
ATTEMPTED
TO
CREATE
A
POSITIVEIDENTIFICATION
FILE
PHOTO
FINGERPRINTS
ETC
I
REFUSED
TO
PERMIT
THIS
AND
FILED
A
COMPLAINT
WITH
THE
UNIVERSITY
ADMINISTRATION
THE
VICEPRESIDENT
FOR
BUSINESS
AFFAIRS
THE
BOSS
OF
THE
CAMPUS
POLICE
STATED
THAT
HE
HAD
NO

A
REMARK
I
HEARD
THE
OTHER
DAY
IS
BEGINNING
TO
TAKE
ON
INCREASINGLY
FRIGHTENING
SIGNIFICANCE
THE
COMMENT
WAS
MADE
THAT
IN
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
WORLD
THE
DEMOCRATS
NOTE
THE
BIG
D
WOULD
BE
KNOWN
AS
SOCIALISTS
WE
MIGHT
GET
FURTHER
IF
WE
BEGIN
BY
ACCEPTING
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
REALLY
COULDNT
BE
BOTHERED
LESS
ABOUT
THE
POLITICAL
OPINIONS
OF
THE
RIGHT
WING
PRO
ESTABLISHMENT
TYPES
JUST
ABOUT
THE
ONLY
CIRCUMSTANCES
IN
WHICH
I
COULD
THINK
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
IN
THEIR
POLITICAL
VIEWS
WOULD
BE
TO
RECRUIT
THEM
AS
SPOOKS
THEY
CAN
BE
GUARANTEED
TO
GIVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
LINE
WHEN
IT
COUNTS
IN
US
HISTORY
IT
HAS
BEEN
THE
SOCIALISTS
SUCH
AS
MYSELF
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
PERSECUTED
NOW
BEFORE
PEOPLE
START
ASSERTING
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
MECHANISM
BY
WHICH
THE
ADMINISTRATION
CAN
GET
THEIR
NEW
CHIP
ADOPTED
WITHOUT
LEGAL
FORCE
LETS
TRY
THINKING
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
MUST
HAVE
EXISTED
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
AS
A
DEFENSE
PROJECT
THEREFORE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
PARTY
MATTER
AT
ALL
GEORGE
BUSH
WAS
IN
ANY
CASE
HARDLY
ADVERSE
TO
TAPPING
CALLS
HE
WAS
CHIEF
SPOOK
REMEMBER
SECONDLY
THE
GOVT
CAN
QUITE
EASILY
APPLY
PRESSURE
THEY
SIMPLY
ASK
THEIR
CHUMS
WHO
THEY
GIVE
HUGE
DEFENSE
CONTRACTS
TO
MOTOROLA
ETC
TO
BE
NICE
BOYS
AFTER
ALL
BILL
IS
GIVING
THEM
A
NICE
LITTLE
TRADE
MONOPOLY
SINCE
THE
CHIPS
WONT
BE
AVALIABLE
TO
FOREIGN
FIRMS
THIRDLY
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CONSIDER
THE
DEMOCRATS
TO
BE
SOCIALIST
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
ONES
WHO
CONSIDER
SOCIALISTS
TO
BE
COMMUNIST
PEOPLE
MIGHT
KNOW
THIS
IF
THE
US
EDUCATION
SYSTEM
DID
NOT
SUFFER
FROM
THE
MCARTHYITE
AND

CORRECTNESS
THE
