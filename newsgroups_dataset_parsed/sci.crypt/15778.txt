re
the
secret
source
of
that
announcement
in
article

maybe
we
should
start
a
newsgroup
for
the
distribution
of
encrypted
posts
intended
of
members
of
affinity
groups
with
a
shared
private
key
for
example
at
the
coming
up
cypherpunks
meeting
a
private
key
corresponding
to
that
particular
meeting
could
be
passed
out
by
a
moderator
minutes
followup
comments
to
other
participants
and
so
on
could
be
posted
to
the
altencrypted
group
for
the
use
of
the
people
who
attended
communiques
intended
by
the
group
for
nonattendees
could
of
course
just
be
signed
using
the
private
key
but
otherwises
not
encrypted
i
like
it
pgp
would
be
useful
i
guess
although
i
dont
have
a
working
version
for
vms
yet
