TIMOTHY
C
MAY
WRITES
GETTING
THE
COURT
ORDER
TO
REVEAL
THE
KEY
ALSO
MAKES
DECIPHERABLE
ALL
PAST
CONVERSATIONS
WHICH
MAY
BE
ON
TAPE
OR
DISK
OR
WHATVER
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
PROPOSAL
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
BUT
IVE
SEEN
NO
MENTION
OF
SESSION
KEYS
BEING
THE
ESCROWED
ENTITIES
TRUE
IN
THEORY
IN
PRACTICE
THE
TECHNOLOGY
OF
CELLULAR
PHONES
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
SPREAD
SPECTRUM
AND
QUITE
DIFFICULT
TO
RECORD
THE
CRYPTTEXT
WITHOUT
THE
KEY
IF
THE
FREQUENCY
PATH
DEPENDS
ON
THEY
KEY
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
TO
IT
COULD
BE
MADE
EFFECTIVELY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
RECORD
ONCE
IT
HITS
LAND
YOU
CAN
RECORD
IT
IF
YOU
HAVE
TELCO
ACCESS
THE
TELCO
ISNT
SUPPOSED
TO
GIVE
THAT
WITHOUT
A
WARRANT
THATS
THE
RULE
TODAY
BUT
EVEN
SO
THE
EVIDENCE
WOULD
NOT
BE
ADMISSIBLE
I
THINK
UNLESS
THE
JUDGE
SO
ORDERED
I
THINK
THAT
EVEN
INTERCEPTION
OF
THE
CRYPTTEXT
WITHOUT
A
WARRANT
WOULD
BE
ILLEGAL
COPS
CANT
RECORD
TODAYS
PLAIN
CELLULAR
CALLS
AND
THEN
ASK
A
JUDGE
HEY
CAN
WE
HAVE
PERMISSION
TO
LISTEN
TO
THOSE
TAPES
CAN
THEY
WORSE
OF
COURSE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
THEN
USES
THIS
CLINTON
CLIPPER
TO
ARGUE
FOR
RESTRICTIONS
ON
UNAPPROVED
ENCRYPTION
THIS
IS
THE
MAIN
CONCERN
OF
MOST
OF
US
I
THINK
THE
CAMELS
NOSE
IN
THE
TENT
ETC
YES
THAT
IS
A
MAJOR
CONCERN
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
THINK
THEY
CAN
WIN
JUST
BY
HAVING
OF
THE
USA
USE
THIS
SYSTEM
THEY
DONT
EVEN
HAVE
TO
CARE
ABOUT
THE
CAUTIOUS
THATS
LEFT
THEY
DONT
CATCH
THE
REALLY
SMART
CROOKS
ANYWAY
JOHN
GOTTI
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
RETARDED
NOT
TO
REALIZE
HE
WAS
LIKELY
TO
BE
WIRETAPPED
GLIBLY
CHATTED
AWAY
ON
HIS
TAPPED
PHONE
ABOUT
MURDER
PLANS
THATS
WHY
HES
IN
JAIL
NOW
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
BUT
TRUE
THIS
SCHEME
CAN
SUCCEED
WITHOUT
LAWS
FORBIDDING
MORE
WHICH
PEOPLE
WOULD
FIGHT
A
LOT
HARDER
THEY
LIKE
THIS
ENOUGH
THAT
THEY
ARE
DROPPING
THE
SO
CALLED
DIGITAL
TELEPHONY
PROPOSAL
ACCORDING
TO
RUMOURS
HOWEVER
THE
MEANING
OF
THAT
IS
COMPLEX
SINCE
THEY
STILL
WANT
TO
GET
AT
THE
CRYPTTEXT
ON
TELCO
SYSTEMS
AND
THAT
REQUIRES
A
BIT
OF
WORK
