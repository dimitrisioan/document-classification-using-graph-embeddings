FORBIDDING
CRYPTED
COMMUNICATION
IS
IMPRACTICAL
HOW
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
SPOT
A
CRYPTED
COMMUNICATION
IN
THE
THOUSANDS
OF
MEGABYTES
OF
DATA
WHICH
CIRCULATE
ON
THE
VARIOUS
EXISTING
NETWORKS
WHAT
ABOUT
PRIVATE
NETWORKS
I
SUSPECT
THE
GOVERNMENT
FEELS
IT
IS
ENOUGH
TO
PREVENT
COMPANIES
FROM
OFFERING
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
SERVICES
BIG
COMPANIES
DONT
TAKE
THAT
KIND
OF
RISK
THEYRE
TOO
VISIBLE
AND
HAVE
TOO
MUCH
TO
LOSE
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
MAY
NOT
HAVE
TO
MAKE
ENCRYPTION
ILLEGAL
TO
PREVENT
ITS
USE
IF
THEY
COULD
CREDIBLY
SAY
TO
IBM
OR
MIT
YOU
WILL
RECEIVE
NO
US
GOVERNMENT
MONEY
NEXT
YEAR
UNLESS
YOU
FOLLOW
THESE
VOLUNTARY
GUIDELINES
ON
USE
OF
ENCRYPTION
I
DOUBT
EITHER
ORGANIZATION
WOULD
DELAY
MAKING
USE
OF
ENCRYPTION
A
VIOLATION
OF
LOCAL
POLICIES
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
GETS
MUCH
OF
ITS
POWER
BY
MAKING
IT
IMPRACTICAL
TO
OPERATE
WITHOUT
GETTING
MONEY
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
WHILE
PUTTING
RESTRICTIONS
ON
USE
OF
SUCH
MONEY
THAT
WOULD
BE
ILLEGAL
IF
THEY
WERE
ENACTED
AS
LAWS
