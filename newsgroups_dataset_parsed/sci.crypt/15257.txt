RE
SOURCE
OF
RANDOM
BITS
ON
A
UNIX
WORKSTATION
FOR
YOUR
APPLICATION
WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
IS
TO
ENCRYPT
THE
REALTIME
CLOCK
VALUE
WITH
A
SECRET
KEY
WELL
ALMOST
IF
I
ONLY
HAD
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
FOR
MYSELF
AND
WERE
WILLING
TO
HAVE
TO
TYPE
IN
A
SECOND
PASSWORD
THE
SECRET
KEY
WHENEVER
I
LOGGED
IN
IT
COULD
WORK
HOWEVER
IM
TRYING
TO
CREATE
A
SOLUTION
THAT
ANYONE
CAN
USE
AND
WHICH
ONCE
INSTALLED
IS
JUST
AS
EFFORTLESS
TO
START
UP
AS
THE
NONSOLUTION
OF
JUST
USING
TO
CONTROL
ACCESS
IVE
GOT
RELIGEOUS

WITH

THANKS
FOR
THE
POINTER
IT
WAS
GOOD
READING
AND
I
LIKED
THE
IDEA
OF
USING
SEVERAL
UNRELATED
SOURCES
WITH
A
STRONG
MIXING
FUNCTION
HOWEVER
UNLESS
I
MISSED
SOMETHING
THE
ONLY
SOURCE
THEY
SUGGESTED
ASIDE
FROM
A
HARDWARE
RNG
THAT
SEEMS
AVAILABLE
AND
UNGUESSABLE
BY
AN
INTRUDER
WHEN
A
UNIX
IS
FRESHBOOTED
IS

RELATED
TO

TRAFFIC
I
BELIEVE
MY
SOLUTION
BASICALLY
USES
THAT
STRATEGY
WITHOUT
REQUIRING
ME
TO
REACH
INTO
THE
KERNEL
A
REASONABLY
SOURCE
OF
RANDOMNESS
IS
THE
OUTPUT
OF
A
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
HASH
FUNCTION
EG
WHEN
FED
WITH
A
LARGE
AMOUNT
OF
MOREORLESS
RANDOM
DATA
FOR
EXAMPLE
RUNNING
ON
DEVMEM
IS
A
SLOW
BUT
RANDOM
ENOUGH
SOURCE
OF
RANDOM
BITS
THERE
ARE
BOUND
TO
BE
BITS
OF
ENTROPY
IN
THE
TENS
OR
HUNDREDS
OF
MEGABYTES
OF
DATA
IN
A
MODERN
WORKSTATIONS
MEMORY
AS
A
FAIR
AMOUNT
OF
THEM
ARE
SYSTEM
TIMERS
IO
BUFFERS
ETC
I
HEARD
ABOUT
THIS
SOLUTION
AND
IT
SOUNDED
GOOD
THEN
I
HEARD
THAT
FOLKS
WERE
EXPERIENCING
TIMES
OF

TO
RUN

NOT

IM
CONSIDERING

THE

OF

THAT
LAUNCHES

SIMULTANEOUSLY
TRIES
TO
SUCK

OFF
THE

AND
IF
THE

SHOULD
BE
SITTING
SO
IDLE
THAT
IT
CANT
GET
