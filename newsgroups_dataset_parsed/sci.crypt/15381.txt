competing
standard
perhaps
one
way
of
getting
away
from
this
cripple
chip
that
the
us
government
seems
to
be
pushing
would
be
to
come
up
with
a
good
alternative
for
example
how
about
a
scheme
using
rsa
and
some
hybrid
of
descfb
and
another
strong
stream
cipher
maybe
ideacfb
this
could
be
substantially
the
same
as
the
cripple
chip
except
that
instead
of
keyregistration
the
police
could
demand
that
you
give
up
your
secret
key
to
them
with
a
court
issued
warrant
then
they
could
read
the
last
few
months
of
wiretapped
messages
youve
sent
and
assuming
youve
committed
no
crimes
you
could
generate
a
new
key
pair
and
go
about
your
business
i
find
that
id
be
willing
to
pay
rsa
for
the
right
to
use
such
a
system
especially
given
the
alternative
if
you
were
unwilling
to
give
up
your
secret
key
then
youd
probably
stay
in
jail
has
anyone
got
a
real
legal
precedent
for
this
this
would
allow
courtissued
warrants
to
be
used
to
gather
information
on
suspected
criminals
but
it
couldnt
be
done
in
secrecy
and
there
would
be
enormously
less
likelihood
of
corruption
or
theft
of
escrowed
keys
maybe
someone
from
the
lawenforcement
or
intelligent
community
will
correct
me
but
this
doesnt
seem
like
such
a
big
loss
in
terms
of
lawenforcement
capabilities
any
comments
