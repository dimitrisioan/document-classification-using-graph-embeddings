SADLY

CAN
BE
COMPELLED
TO
GIVE

AND

EXEMPLARS
AND
TO
TAKE

AND

TESTS
I
AM
SURE
THAT
MIKE
IS
CORRECT
ON
THIS
POINT
I
AM
ALSO
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
ADMINISTERING
TRUTH
SERUM
WOULD
BE
RULED
A
VIOLATION
OF
YOUR
RIGHT
NOT
TO
INCRIMINATE
YOURSELF
BUT
WHAT
IS
THE
SALIENT
DIFFERENCE
YOU
CAN
FIND
THE
SALIENT
DIFFERENCE
IN
ANY
NUMBER
OF
AMENDMENT
RELATED

THE

I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
THAT
IS
A
SLIGHT
VARIATION
ON
THE
PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED
EXAMPLES
THAT
PERHAPS
PEOPLE
COULD
GIVE
ME
SOME
POINTERS
ON
IT
HAS
BEEN
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
SINCE
MY
CON
LAW
CLASS
IN
COLLEGE
SO
I
HOPE
I
AM
NOT
MISSING
SOMETHING
OBVIOUS
HERE
BASIC
SCENARIO
I
SET
UP
A
BBS
THAT
USES
PUBLICKEY
ENCRYPTION
AND
ENCRYPTION
OF
FILES
ON
DISK
THE
GENERAL
SETUP
IS
DESIGNED
SO
THAT
WHEN
USERS
CONNECT
THEY
SEND
A
PRIVATE
KEY
ENCRYPTED
USING
THE
SYSTEM
PUBLIC
KEY
AND
THE
USERS
PUBLICPRIVATE
KEYPAIR
IS
USED
TO
WRAP
THE
ONETIME
SESSION
KEYS
USED
FOR
ENCRYPTING
THE
FILES
ON
DISK
THE
RESULT
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
EVEN
IF
I
REVEAL
THE
SYSTEM
PRIVATE
KEY
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
ANYONE
TO
GAIN
ACCESS
TO
THE
FILES
STORED
ON
THE
MACHINE
WHAT
IS
POSSIBLE
IS
FOR
SOMEONE
TO
USE
THE
REVEALED
SYSTEM
PRIVATE
KEY
TO
ENTICE
USERS
INTO
REVEALING
THIER
PERSONAL
PRIVATE
KEYS
DURING
THE
AUTHENTICATION
SEQUENCE
QUESTIONS
DOES
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
PRIVATE
KEY
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
ANY
INFORMATION
USEFUL
FOR
A
SEARCH
GIVE
ME
ANY
PROTECTION
AS
FAR
AS
BEING
COERCED
TO
REVEAL
THE
KEY
I
DOUBT
IT
MYSELF
IT
SEEMS
PROVIDING
THE
SYSTEM
PRIVATE
KEY
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
I
AM
ASSISTING
IN
ENTRAPMENT
THE
USERS
WOULD
SEND
THIER
KEY
ANYWAY
AND
ARE
NOT
BEING
ENTICED
INTO
DOING
SOMETHING
THEY
WOULD
NOT
OTHERWISE
DO
BUT
IS
THERE
ANY
OTHER
HOOK
THAT
CAN
BE
USED
WOULD
THE
USER
PRIVATEKEY
ENTICEMENT
REQUIRE
WIRETAP
APPROVAL
ANY
ANSWERS
OR
GENERAL
MUSINGS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
