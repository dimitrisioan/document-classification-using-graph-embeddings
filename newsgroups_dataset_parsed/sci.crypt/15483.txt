MORE
INTERESTINGLY
WE
KNOW

FACT
THAT

NO

NO
MORE
THAN
WHY
NOT

AT

WHY
THIS

RESTRICTION

IF
IT
NOT
TO

I
FIND
IT
DISTURBING
THAT
AT
THE

BEST
MY

IS
DEPENDANT
ON
APPROXIMATELY
BYTES
WORTH

THAT

BE

EVEN

PERIODICALLY
THE
RATIONALE
BEHIND

RESTRICTION
IN
THE

SEEMS
STRANGE
IF
ONE
IS
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
GOAL
IS

AND
MAKES
PERFECT
SENSE
IF
THE

IS
AN
ILLUSION
OF

IF

DO
NOT

I

WE
ARE
ASSURED
THAT
THIS
CANNOT
HAPPEN

NO
ONE
UNDERSTANDS
HOW

WORKS
OUTSIDE

OFFICIALS
AND
SOON
FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE

VIA

PRESUMABLY
WE
WILL
EVENTUALLY
HAVE

GETS
MORE

ADVANCED
EVERY

BUT
BY
THE
TIME
WE
KNOW
IT
MAY
BE
TOO
LATE
AS
A
SEQUENCE
OF
VALUES
FOR

U
ARE
GENERATED
THEY
ARE
WRITTEN
ONTO
THREE
SEPARATE
FLOPPY
DISKS
THE
FIRST
DISK
CONTAINS
A

FOR

THAT

THE

THE

THE

CONTAINS
THE

U

TAKES
THE
FIRST
DISK
AND

TAKES
THE

THE
THIRD

IS
USED
TO

AFTER

ALL

BE
DESTROYED
FOR
ADDITIONAL
ASSURANCE
THAT
NO

IS
LEFT
BEHIND
NONE
OF
THIS
MAKES
ME
FEEL
THE
LEAST
BIT
SECURE
THE
SILLY
NOTION
OF
DESTROYING
THE
LAPTOP
APPEARS
TO
BE
YET
ANOTHER
BIZARRE
DISTRACTION
WE
ALL
KNOW
THAT
YOU
CANT
READ
DATA
FROM
DRAM
THAT
HAS
BEEN
TURNED
OFF
FOR
MORE
THAN
A
FEW
MOMENTS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WHAT
WE
DONT
KNOW
IS
WHY
THERE
IS
A
NEED
TO
GENERATE
THE

FROM

IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
OTHER
THAN
TO
WEAKEN
THE
SYSTEM
WE
DONT
KNOW
IF
THE

IN
QUESTION
WOULD
RESIST
A
MILLION
IN
CASH
A
PIECE
FOR
THEIR
INFORMATION
ITS
PROBABLY
WORTH
HUNDREDS
OF

SO
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THE
BRIBE
ARBITRARILY

RESIST

TO

THE

THE
