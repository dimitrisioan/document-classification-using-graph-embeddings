each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages
encrypted
with
the
chip
hmmm
a
thirty
bit
serial
number
and
we
are
told
the
unit
key
u
is
derived
deterministically
from
this
serial
number
that
means
that
there
are
only
one
billion
possible
unit
keys
to
generate
the
unit
key
for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce
and
and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to
and
the
second
bits
to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit
key
u
is
the
xor
of
and
and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
hmmm
we
must
assume
that
generating
the
unit
key
u
from
the
serial
number
n
rather
than
generating
it
from
a
randomly
selected
and
is
an
intentional
way
of
assuring
a
fail
safe
for
the
government
u
is
completedly
determined
given
and
n
if
and
do
not
change
they
constitute
effective
master
keys
along
with
f
the
theft
of
which
or
the
possession
of
which
by
various
authorities
completely
obviates
the
security
of
the
system
however
more
interestingly
we
know
for
a
fact
that
if
and
are
fixed
no
matter
what
the
keyspace
for
u
is
no
more
than
why
not
pick
and
at
random
why
this
interesting
restriction
of
they
key
space
if
it
not
to
provide
an
additional
back
door
i
find
it
disturbing
that
at
the
very
best
my
security
is
dependant
on
approximately
bytes
worth
of
information
that
could
be
written
on
the
back
of
a
napkin
even
if
and
change
periodically
the
rationale
behind
this
restriction
in
the
size
of
the
keyspace
seems
strange
if
one
is
assuming
that
the
goal
is
security
and
makes
perfect
sense
if
the
goal
is
an
illusion
of
security
if
and
do
not
change
even
if
they
remain
secret
i
wonder
if
they
can
somehow
be
backderived
given
enough
unit
keyserial
number
pairs
we
are
assured
that
this
cannot
happen
but
no
one
understands
how
skipjack
works
outside
of
government
officials
and
soon
foreign
intelligence
services
that
gain
the
information
via
espionage
presumably
we
will
eventually
have
the
information
as
well
reverse
engineering
gets
more
and
more
advanced
every
year
but
by
the
time
we
know
it
may
be
too
late
as
a
sequence
of
values
for
and
u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial
number
that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second
disk
is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third
disk
contains
the
unit
keys
u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second
disk
the
third
disk
is
used
to
program
the
chips
after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the
vault
and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
none
of
this
makes
me
feel
the
least
bit
secure
the
silly
notion
of
destroying
the
laptop
appears
to
be
yet
another
bizarre
distraction
we
all
know
that
you
cant
read
data
from
dram
that
has
been
turned
off
for
more
than
a
few
moments
on
the
other
hand
what
we
dont
know
is
why
there
is
a
need
to
generate
the
unit
keys
from
and
in
the
first
place
other
than
to
weaken
the
system
we
dont
know
if
the
agents
in
question
would
resist
a
million
in
cash
a
piece
for
their
information
its
probably
worth
hundreds
of
million
so
you
can
make
the
bribe
arbitrarily
hard
to
resist
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
doing
this
in
a
vault
rather
than
in
joe
random
tempestshielded
room
with
a
laptop
computer
seems
like
melodrama
designed
to
make
highschool
dropouts
from
peoria
impressed
but
it
does
very
little
for
most
of
the
rest
of
us
the
protocol
may
be
changed
slightly
so
that
four
people
are
in
the
room
instead
of
two
the
first
two
would
provide
the
seeds
and
and
the
second
two
the
escrow
agents
would
take
the
disks
back
to
the
escrow
agencies
what
would
this
provide
lets
say
the
escrow
agencies
are
the
aclu
and
the
nra
and
their
agents
personally
take
back
the
disks
and
are
always
honest
who
cares
the
nsa
must
be
laughing
out
loud
because
they
have
the
algorithm
to
regenerate
u
given
n
and
likely
dont
need
to
steal
they
keys
as
they
effectively
already
have
them
