white

qas
on
clipper
chip
encryption
bred
wrote
and
this
means
that
the
fbi
will
want
to
track
the
customer
lists
of
better
encryption
phones
because
the
only
reason
a
person
would
want
one
is
to
evade
the
police
they
dont
have
to
track
customer
lists
they
merely
have
to
digitally
listen
to
any
phone
line
and
eliminate
any
that
dont
have
the
clipper
headersignature
noone
has
said
how
it
will
be
modulated
want
a
bet
its
a
nonstandard
and
hence
easily
recognisable
baudrate
devices
to
scan
exchanges
and
detect
modems
etc
already
exist
ive
seen
them
advertised
in
the
trade
press
once
you
eliminate
crippled
crypto
devices
and
ordinary
data
modems
whats
left
is
crypto
worth
looking
more
closely
at
i
guess
any
substitute
scheme
will
have
to
be
or
vfast
to
disguise
it
though
then
they
just
start
looking
at
the
data
too
whatever
happens
though
the
effect
of
this
new
chip
will
be
to
make
private
crypto
stand
out
like
a
sore
thumb
