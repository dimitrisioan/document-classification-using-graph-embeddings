the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
yes
this
is
a
serious
problem
but
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
world
guess
what
were
doing
something
now
you
cant
do
in
a
communist
country
or
nazi
germany
or
john
edgar
hoovers
usa
were
complaining
about
it
or
rather
youre
complaining
about
it
and
nobody
is
shooting
at
us
yet
guess
what
people
you
live
in
one
of
the
few
countries
in
the
world
where
a
person
can
complain
without
getting
shot
at
yet
people
are
always
complaining
that
somebody
did
this
wrong
or
somebody
did
that
wrong
or
whatever
sit
down
and
figure
out
two
things
what
have
they
done
right
how
much
worse
can
it
get
and
youll
find
that
you
and
i
are
pretty
damn
lucky
so
far
so
lets
talk
about
it
get
some
action
going
decide
whats
going
on
but
lets
not
overreact
what
harm
is
there
in
overreacting
this
may
be
the
largest
single
threat
to
civil
liberties
yet
in
my
lifetime
the
us
has
done
some
pretty
heinous
things
in
the
past
and
we
havent
yet
recovered
from
all
of
them
there
certainly
seems
to
be
a
historical
trend
towards
less
liberty
with
occasional
perturbations
time
to
break
out
the
quotes
from
american
political
radicals
lyle
transarc
grant
street
the
gulf
tower
pittsburgh
there
are
more
instances
of
the
abridgement
of
the
freedom
of
the
people
by
the
gradual
and
silent
encroachment
of
those
in
power
than
by
violent
and
sudden
usurpation
