writes
just
a
question
as
a
provider
of
a
public
bbs
service
arent
you
bound
by
law
to
gurantee
intelligble
access
to
the
data
of
the
users
on
the
bbs
if
police
comes
with
sufficent
authorisation
i
guessed
this
would
be
a
basic
condition
for
such
systems
i
did
run
a
bbs
some
time
ago
but
that
was
in
switzerland
the
us
doesnt
yet
have
many
laws
covering
bbss
theyre
not
common
carriers
theyre
not
phone
companies
theyre
just
private
machines
or
services
operated
by
businesses
theres
no
obligation
to
keep
records
as
perry
metzger
points
out
if
the
police
come
with
a
search
warrant
you
have
to
let
them
see
what
the
warrant
demands
if
it
exists
and
they
generally
can
confiscate
the
equipment
as
evidence
which
is
not
constitutionally
valid
but
were
only
beginning
to
develop
court
cases
supporting
us
a
court
may
be
able
to
compel
you
to
tell
them
information
you
know
such
as
the
encryption
password
for
the
disk
there
arent
any
definitive
cases
yet
since
its
a
new
situation
and
there
probably
arent
laws
specifically
covering
it
but
the
court
cant
force
you
to
know
the
keys
and
there
are
no
laws
preventing
you
from
allowing
your
users
to
have
their
own
keys
for
their
own
files
without
giving
them
to
you
even
in
areas
that
do
have
established
law
there
is
uncertainty
there
was
a
guy
in
idaho
a
few
years
ago
who
had
his
business
records
subpoenaed
as
evidence
for
taxes
or
some
other
businessrestriction
law
so
he
gave
the
court
the
records
which
were
in
hebrew
the
us
doesnt
have
laws
forcing
you
to
keep
your
records
in
english
and
these
were
the
originals
of
the
records
he
didnt
speak
hebrew
and
neither
did
anybody
in
the
court
organization
dont
think
they
were
able
to
do
much
about
it
it
might
be
illegal
for
your
bbs
to
deny
access
to
potential
customers
based
on
race
religion
national
origin
gender
or
sexual
preference
it
probably
hasnt
been
tested
in
court
but
it
seems
like
a
plausible
extension
of
antidiscrimination
laws
affecting
other
businesses

peace
