BRAD
TEMPLETON
WRITES
IT
OCCURS
TO
ME
THAT
IF
THEY
GET
A
WIRETAP
ORDER
ON
YOU
AND
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
RELEASE
YOUR
CODE
TO
THE
COPS
YOUR
CODE
IS
NOW
NO
LONGER
SECURE
A
VERY
GOOD
POINT
ITS
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
COPS
AND
WHILE
I
AM
SURE
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THEY
ARE
GOOD
THEIR
SECURITY
WILL
NOT
BE
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
WHY
SHOULD
WE
EXPECT
THE
COPS
TO
BE
HONEST
THEYRE
UNDERPAID
FOR
THE
RISKS
THEY
FACE
EVERY
DAY
THE
MEDIA
DUMPS
ON
THE
ALL
THE
TIME
AND
BLAMES
THEM
FOR
ALL
SORTS
OF
DISCRIMINATION
BRUTALITY
HOW
CAN
WE
EXPECT
THEM
TO
BE
MORE
THAN
HUMAN
BESIDES
THERE
ARE
LOTS
OF
CASES
OF
POLICE
ABUSES
RANGING
FROM
PROTECTION
SCAMS
TO
OUTRIGHT
ROBBERY
WHEN
I
WORKED
IN
DC
THERE
WAS
A
BREAKIN
AT
A
LOCAL
RADIO
SHACK
AND
THE
ALARM
COMPANY
HEARD
THE
COPS
RESPONDING
TO
THE
CALL
OVER
THE
AUDIO
PICKUP
IN
THE
STORE
WHAT
THIS
EFFECTIVELY
MEANS
IS
THAT
IF
THEY
PERFORM
A
WIRETAP
ON
YOU
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
WIRETAP
THEY
SHOULD
BE
OBLIGATED
TO
INFORM
YOU
THAT
A
TAP
WAS
PERFORMED
AND
REPLACE
FOR
FREE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
YOUR
CELLULAR
PHONE
SO
THAT
IT
IS
ONCE
AGAIN
A
CODE
KNOWN
ONLY
TO
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
THEN
YOU
WOULD
KNOW
THAT
BIG
BROTHER
HAD
BEEN
LISTENING
DOES
HE
REALLY
WANT
TO
LET
YOU
KNOW
DO
THE
POLICE
NORMALLY
REVEAL
EVERY
TAP
THEY
DO
EVEN
IF
NO
CHARGES
ARE
LAID
IN
MANY
WAYS
IT
WOULD
BE
A
POSITIVE
STEP
IF
THEY
HAD
TO
JUDGES
SET
TIME
LIMITS
ON
WARRANTS
I
ASSUME
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TIME
LIMIT
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
TO
RENEW
OR
REPLACE
YOUR
CHIP
THATS
IF
WE
GO
WITH
THIS
SCHEME
WHICH
I
AM
NOT
SURE
I
AGREE
WITH
IM
COMPLETELY
AGAINST
ANYTHING
THAT
MAKES
IT
EASIER
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
ENCROACH
ON
THE
RIGHTS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
THE
FOUNDERS
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
SPENT
A
LOT
OF
EFFORT
LIMITING
THE
POWER
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
SPECIFYING
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
GOVERNMENTS
RIGHTS
WERE
AND
THIS
DIDNT
INCLUDE
A
GOVT
SPY
IN
EVERY
BEDROOM
IMHO
THERE
ARE
ENTIRELY
TOO
MANY
THINGS
GOING
ON
TODAY
DESIGNED
TO
PRESERVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
ORGANISM
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
INDIVIDUALS
LOOK
