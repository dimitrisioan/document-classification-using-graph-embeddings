RE
FROM
CROSSBOWS
TO
CRYPTOGRAPHY
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
MINDSET
IS
A
MISTAKE
BEFORE
THERE
WERE
CATTLE
PRODS
GOVERNMENTS
TORTURED
THEIR
PRISONERS
WITH
CLUBS
AND
RUBBER
HOSES
BEFORE
THERE
WERE
LASERS
FOR
EAVESDROPPING
GOVERNMENTS
USED
BINOCULARS
AND
LIPREADERS
THOUGH
GOVERNMENT
CERTAINLY
USES
TECHNOLOGY
TO
OPPRESS
THE
EVIL
LIES
NOT
IN
THE
TOOLS
BUT
IN
THE
WIELDER
OF
THE
TOOLS
EVIL
AND
GOOD
WALK
HAND
IN
HAND
IT
IS
ALSO
IMPORTANT
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
GOOD
IN
THE
TOOLS
LIES
IN
THE
WIELDER
OF
THE
TOOLS
IN
FACT
TECHNOLOGY
REPRESENTS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
PROMIS
ING
AVENUES
AVAILABLE
FOR
RECAPTURING
OUR
FREEDOMS
FROM
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
STOLEN
THEM
I
CANNOT
ACCEPT
THIS
RIDICULOUS
LEAP
IN
LOGIC
TECHNOLOGY
IS
NEUTRAL
TO
GOOD
OR
EVIL
WHEN
TECHNOLOGY
IS
USED
BY
EVIL
MEN
IT
IS
CALLED
EVIL
TECHNOLOGY
WHEN
IT
IS
USED
BY
GOOD
MEN
IT
IS
CALLED
GOOD
TECHNOLOGY
REALLY
IT
IS
JUST
TECHNOLOGY
THAT
ALLOWS
ACTION
TO
BE
REALIZED
MORE
EFFICENTLY
AND
ON
A
LARGER
SCALE
BY
ITS
VERY
NATURE
IT
FAVORS
THE
BRIGHT
WHO
CAN
PUT
IT
TO
USE
OVER
THE
DULL
WHO
CAN
NOT
TRY
NOT
TO
CONFUSED
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
TECHNOLOGY
WITH
ITS
USE
CERTAINLY
BRIGHT
PEOPLE
WILL
BE
BETTER
AT
CREATING
TECHNOLOGY
BUT
EVEN
YOUNG
CHILDREN
KNOW
HOW
TO
PROGRAM
VCR
MACHINES
ARE
VCR
MACHINES
NOT
EXTREMELY
COMPLEX
TO
CREATE
IT
FAVORS
THE
ADAPTABLE
WHO
ARE
QUICK
TO
SEE
THE
MERIT
OF
THE
NEW
OVER
THE
SLUGGISH
WHO
CLING
TO
TIME
TESTED
WAYS
ADAPTIBILITY
AND
FLEXIBILITY
IS
ALWAYS
BETTER
AT
ENDURING
THAN
THE
STIFF
AND
STUBBORN
A
YOUNG
CHILD
IS
SOFT
AND
SUPPLE
AN
OLD
MAN
IS
STIFF
AND
INFLEXIBLE
A
DRIPPING
OF
WATER
CAN
CUT
THROUGH
STONE
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
TECHNOLOGY
RATHER
TECHNOLOGY
JUST
ALLOWS
US
TO
MAGNIFY
ACTION
AND
WHAT
TWO
BETTER
WORDS
ARE
THERE
TO
DE
SCRIBE
GOVERNMENT
BUREAUCRACY
THAN
DULL
AND
SLUGGISH
I
HAVE
NO
