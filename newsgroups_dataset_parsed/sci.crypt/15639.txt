I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
LOBBY
AND
IT
IS
US
IN
ARTICLE
LANGFORDGEMSVCUEDU
WRITES
HOWEVER
ITS
LIKELY
TO
BE
AS
HARD
OR
HARDER
TO
EXERCISE
THIS
RIGHT
AS
IT
IS
GETTING
TO
EXERCISE
THE
OTHER
RIGHTS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
SLOWLY
RESTRICTING
MAYBE
THE
NRA
WOULD
BE
THE
BEST
EXISTING
ORGANIZATION
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
A
NEW
ONE
MIGHT
BE
BETTER
BUT
PERHAPS
WOULD
TAKE
TOO
LONG
TO
START
UP
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
JOIN
THE
NRA
IS
SUCCESSFUL
BECAUSE
AMONG
A
NUMBER
OF
THINGS
ON
THE
DROP
OF
A
HAT
THEY
CAN
GET
A
CONGRESSPERSONS
OFFICE
FLOODED
WITH
POSTCARDS
FAXES
AND
PHONE
CALLS
CERTAINLY
WITH
OUR
WAYCOOL
INTERNET
POWERS
OF
ORGANIZATION
WE
CAN
ACT
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
IF
SUCH
ACTION
IS
APPROPRIATE
AS
LONG
AS
WE
ARE
KEPT
INFORMED
OF
EVENTS
ANYONE
ON
THIS
BBOARD
CAN
MAKE
A
CALL
TO
ACTION
HOPEFULLY
WERE
A
STRONG
ENOUGH
COMMUNITY
TO
ACT
ON
THOSE
CALLS
I
REALIZE
THIS
IS
A
LITTLE
OPTOMISTIC
AND
IM
GLAD
EFF
IS
WORKING
IN
THE
LOOP
ON
THESE
ISSUES
BUT
DONT
UNDERESTIMATE
THE
POTENTIAL
OF
THE
NET
FOR
POLITICAL
ACTION

I
SPEAK
FOR
MYSELF
