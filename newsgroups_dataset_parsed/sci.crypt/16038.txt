CARL
ELLISON
WRITES
IVE
BEEN
READING
THE
SCICRYPT
ALTPRIVACYCLIPPER
AND
COMPORGEFFTALK
DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
FIND
AS
USUAL
THAT
MOST
OF
US
THINK
ALIKE
SO
THERES
A
LOT
OF
REPITITION
IF
EACH
OF
THESE
MESSAGES
WERE
SENT
TO
CLINTON
AS
WELL
AS
TO
THE
NET
OR
INSTEAD
OF
TO
THE
NET
WE
MIGHT
ACTUALLY
HAVE
SOME
EFFECT
WHITE
HOUSE
IS
THIS
WHITE
HOUSE
EMAIL
ADDRESS
REALLY
WORKING
YET
SOMEONE
POSTED
SUCH
AN
ADDRESS
ON
COMPUSERVE
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
BUT
APPARENTLY
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
WASNT
REALLY
SET
UP
TO
RECIVE
HUNDREDS
THOUSANDS
OF
MESSAGES
A
DAY
TO
THAT
ACCOUNT
AND
DIDNT
WANT
PEOPLE
TO
USE
IT
YET
SO
IS
THIS
MCI
ADDRESS
SOMETHING
THE
PEOPLE
AT
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
ACTUALLY
READ
OR
IS
IT
ANOTHER
CRAIG
SHERGOLD
STORY
I
DONT
KNOW
IM
JUST
ASKING
UNLESS
THE
PEOPLE
AT
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
PRINT
AND
DISTRIBUTE
THIS
MAIL
EVERY
DAY
YOU
MAY
HAVE
BETTER
LUCK
PRINTING
OUT
A
LETTER
ON
PAPER
THAT
FLAT
WHITE
STUFF
ALL
OVER
MY
DESK
AND
SNAILMAILING
IT
TO
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
I
IMAGINE
WRITING
TO
YOUR
LOCAL
REPRESENTATIVE
AND
SENATOR
WOULDNT
HURT
EITHER
HECK
WHY
NOT
WRITE
TO
AL
GORE
WHILE
YOURE
