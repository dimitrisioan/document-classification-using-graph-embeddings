RE
HOW
DOES
IT
REALLY
WORK
WAS
RE
TEXT
OF
WHITE
HOUSE
ANNOUNCEMENT
AND
QAS
ON
CLIPPER
CHIP
ENCRYPTION
MARC
VANHEYNINGEN
MVANHEYNCSINDIANAEDU
WRITES
THE
MAIN
THING
I
JUST
DONT
GET
IS
WHETHER
THIS
CHIP
IMPLEMENTS
SYMMETRIC
OR
ASYMMETRIC
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
TECHNIQUES
ANYBODY
KNOW
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
IM
AS
WILLING
TO
SPECULATE
AS
ANYONE
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THAT
THE
CHIPS
USE
PUBLICKEY
CRYPTOGRAPHY
ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY
IS
TO
USE
DIFFIEHELLMAN
KEY
EXCHANGE
OR
SOME
OTHER
ALGORITHM
WHICH
HAS
A
SIMILAR
EFFECT
DH
ALLOWS
BOTH
ENDS
TO
AGREE
ON
A
SESSION
KEY
WHICH
THEY
USE
WITH
SYMMETRIC
CRYPTOGRAPHY
SOMETHING
LIKE
DES
FOR
THE
ENCRYPTION
HOW
COULD
THE
BACK
DOOR
KEYS
WORK
IN
THIS
SYSTEM
I
CAN
SEE
A
FEW
POSSIBILITIES
ONE
IS
THAT
THE
DHLIKE
ALGORITHM
HAS
THE
PROPERTY
THAT
THE
SESSION
KEY
CAN
BE
DEDUCED
BY
AN
EAVESDROPPER
WHO
KNOWS
THE
BACK
DOOR
KEYS
FOR
ONE
OR
POSSIBLY
BOTH
COMMUNICANTS
PERHAPS
THE
RANDOM
NUMBERS
USED
IN
THE
DH
ARE
SEEDED
BY
THE
BACK
DOOR
KEY
OR
SOME
SUCH
ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY
AS
WAS
SUGGESTED
HERE
EARLIER
IS
THAT
THE
CHIPS
SIMPLY
BROADCAST
THE
SESSION
KEY
ENCRYPTED
WITH
THE
CHIPS
OWN
INTERNAL
SECRET
KEY
IN
THIS
SYSTEM
THE
BACK
DOOR
KEYS
ARE
SECRET
KEYS
USABLE
FOR
DECRYPTING
THIS
SESSION
KEY
BROADCAST
ACTUALLY
THE
CHIPS
SECRET
KEY
DOESNT
NEED
TO
BE
A
PUBLIC
KEY
IN
THIS
USAGE
BUT
CAN
BE
IDENTICAL
TO
THE
SECRET
BACKDOOR
KEY
THIS
PROPOSAL
SEEMS
MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD
TO
ME
STILL
ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY
IS
THAT
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
USED
FOR
THE
MESSAGE
ITSELF
HAS
A
DUAL
KEY
PROPERTY
THAT
POSSESSION
OF
EITHER
OF
TWO
KEYS
CAN
BE
USED
TO
DECRYPT
IT
ONE
KEY
WOULD
BE
THE
SESSION
KEY
FROM
THE
DH
EXCHANGE
AND
THE
OTHER
WOULD
BE
THE
BACK
DOOR
KEY
FOR
THE
CHIP
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
PROPOSALS
DOROTHY
DENNING
RAISED
DURING
HER
AMAZINGLY
PRESCIENT
ONLINE
DISCUSSION
LAST
NOVEMBER
AND
DECEMBER
WAS
A
VARIATION
ON
DIFFIEHELLMAN
IN
WHICH
A
THIRD
PARTY
WOULD
PARTICIPATE
IN
DERIVING
THE
SESSION
KEYS
THIS
DOESNT
QUITE
FIT
INTO
WHAT
WE
KNOW
OF
HOW
CLIPPER
WORKS
BUT
IT
HINTS
THAT
THOSE
WHO
HAD
EARLY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
CLIPPER
OR
WHOSE
THINKING
WAS
SOMEHOW
SYNCHRONIZED
WITH
CLIPPER
DESIGNERS
MAY
HAVE
HAD
DIFFIEHELLMAN
ON
THEIR
MINDS
