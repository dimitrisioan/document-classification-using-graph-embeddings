KNOW

IS
PROBABLY
WHY
THEY
QUIETLY

ALWAYS
AMAZES
ME
HOW
QUICK
PEOPLE
ARE

WHATEVER
ADMINISTRATION
IS
CURRENT
FOR

THEY
COULDNT
POSSIBLY
HAVE
INITIATED
THIS
CHIP
HAD
TO
TAKE
YEARS
TO

YET
ALREADY
WERE
CLAIMING
THAT
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
SNEAKED
IT
IN
ON
US
BULLSHIT
THE
BUSH
ADMINISTRATION
AND
THE
CAREER
GESTAPO
WERE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THIS
HORROR
AND
THE
CAREERISTS
PRESENTED
IT
TO
THE
NEW
PRESIDENCY
AS
A
FAIT

THAT
DOESNT
EXCUSE
CLINTON

GORE
FROM

LETS
LAY
THE

AT

ARE
SO
CORRECT
CLINTON
DID
NOT
INITIATE
IT
HE
JUST
CAST
IT
IN
GRANITE
BY
IMPLIMENTING
NOT
STOPPING
THE
DECISION
I
ALSO
STATED

I
DONT

I
STILL

BUSH

CLINTON
IS
BUSTING
HIS
BUTT
IN

REGARD
THAT
REVEALS
A
TOTAL

IN

CLINTON
APPEARS
TO
SUPPORT
