if
you
can
get
it
for
a

hand
it
must
be
true
eh
im
pretty
sure
the
nsa
is
supposed
to
among
many
other
things
provide
highquality
cryptosystems
to
a
variety
of
places
i
dont
recall
reading
anywhere
reliable
that
theyre
supposed
to
monitor
my
phonecalls
monitor
usenet
provide
only
cryptosystems
they
can
easily
crack
etc
etc
this
is
not
to
say
that
they
dont
they
might
but
you
dont
know
that
they
do
and
you
have
no
evidence
that
they
do
for
almost
all
values
of
you
it
follows
therefore
that
for
most
values
of
you
your
claims
about
the
nsa
border
on
paranoia

ok
andrew
ill
provide
some
evidence
a
friend
of
mine
worked
for
an
electronics
manufacturer
on
with
a
westcoast
office
they
routinely
sold
equipment
to
the
japanese
one
day
the
japanese
started
showing
up
with
discount
demands
that
were
amazingly
close
to
the
cost
to
manufacture
the
products
this
company
routinely
sent
most
of
the
manufacturing
data
to
the
field
offices
the
japanese
had
simply
intercepted
it
so
my
friend
the
computer
systems
admin
came
up
with
a
solution
he
started
sending
the
data
out
doubleblockencrypted
with
des
two
days
after
this
new
distribution
plan
was
implemented
the
president
of
the
company
got
a
visit
from
a
pair
of
government
agents
they
told
him
to
knock
it
off
the
president
gave
in
since
his
company
did
a
considerable
business
with
the
federal
government
now
if
the
government
wasnt
monitoring
the
communications
how
would
they
even
know
that
the
encryption
system
was
installed
further
since
encryp
tion
isnt
illegal
and
des
certainly
isnt
what
is
the
basis
of
the
governments
ceaseanddesist
demand
the
spooks
do
whatever
they
think
is
necessary
with
or
without
the
blessings
of
the
law
ill
say
no
thanks
to
clipper
or
anything
else
the
government
produces
for
the
moment
double
or
triple
des
is
probably
adequate
and
when
the
line
is
idle
send
random
garbage
just
to
keep
em
busy
