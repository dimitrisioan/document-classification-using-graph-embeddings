the
date
i
have
for
this
is
note
clintons
statements
about
encryption
in
the
paragraph
i
guess
this
statement
doesent
contradict
what
you
said
though
cut
here
washington
upi
the
war
on
drugs
is
about
to
get
a
fresh
start
president
clinton
told
delegates
to
the
national
federation
of
police
commisioners
convention
in
washington
in
the
first
speech
on
the
drug
issue
since
his
innaugural
clinton
said
that
his
planned
escalation
of
the
drug
war
would
make
everything
so
far
seem
so
halfhearted
that
for
all
practical
i
just
found
out
from
my
source
that
this
article
was
a
joke
heh
heh
it
seemed
pretty
damn
convincing
to
me
from
the
start
i
just
didnt
notice
the
smiley
at
the
end
of
the
article
and
there
were
a
few
other
hints
which
i
should
of
caught
well
isnt
this
just
a
hoot
all
i
read
on
this
group
is
a
bunch
of
ppl
fearing
the
misuses
of
information
by
the
big
bad
evil
govt
this
just
happens
to
be
a
case
of
an
ordinaryjoenetter
who
decided
that
he
would
create
andor
distribute
some
misinformation
ppl
buy
into
bs
posts
like
this
i
know
because
i
forwarded
a
copy
of
the
post
to
my
office
mate
who
turned
around
and
was
although
he
wont
admit
itsorry
joe
ready
to
get
in
a
fight
about
forfeiture
please
if
were
going
to
hold
our
govt
which
admittedly
has
had
and
still
has
its
problems
to
high
standards
then
mustnt
we
follow
these
too
electronic
freedoms
only
go
so
far
anyway
i
guess
this
joke
did
turn
out
to
resemble
clintons
true
feelings
at
least
to
some
extent
sorry
about
that
