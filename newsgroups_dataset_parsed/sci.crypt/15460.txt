re
more
technical
details
encrypted
under
k
then
k
will
be
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
uk
and
the
serial
number
of
the
unit
added
to
produce
a
three
part
message
which
will
then
be
encrypted
under
the
system
key
sk
producing
e
em
k
ek
uk
serial
number
sk
my
understanding
is
that
em
k
is
not
encrypted
under
sk
called
the
family
key
and
that
the
decrypt
key
corresponding
to
sk
is
held
by
law
enforcement
does
anyone
have
first
hand
knowledge
on
this
i
will
also
check
it
out
but
this
is
sunday
so
i
did
not
want
to
wait
ok
so
there
are
in
fact
two
distinct
components
transmitted
by
the
chip
the
real
message
encrypted
with
the
conventional
key
and
the
serial
number
and
encrypted
conventional
key
encrypted
with
the
imho
kind
of
bogus
as
the
whole
concept
of
one
key
that
millions
of
people
use
which
cant
be
changed
doesnt
seem
reasonable
family
key
suppose
i
analyze
the
output
of
this
chip
and
im
able
to
determine
which
bits
are
the
encrypted
packet
which
contains
the
serial
number
and
session
key
suppose
i
also
design
a
simple
algorithm
based
on
this
information
which
takes
the
data
containing
the
encrypted
session
key
and
twiddles
a
bit
or
several
before
its
sent
down
the
line
mind
you
im
sure
the
nsa
thought
of
this
along
with
a
dozen
other
attacks
i
cant
imagine
and
the
system
is
probably
somehow
designed
so
that
manipulation
of
this
information
will
cause
a
compliant
receiving
chip
to
somehow
fail
to
decrypt
successfully
but
how
what
if
the
two
parties
agree
in
advance
on
some
kind
of
consistent
bittwiddling
scheme
so
the
decryption
chip
sees
the
restored
proper
bitstream
but
an
eavesdropper
gets
a
ek
uk
packet
thats
wrong
i
suppose
this
could
be
easily
defeated
if
the
chip
sends
that
information
out
many
times
in
slightly
different
ways
making
it
effectively
impossible
to
be
certain
you
know
all
the
information
being
sent
