this
is
the
second
of
ten
parts
of
the
scicrypt
faq
the
parts
are
mostly
independent
but
you
should
read
the
first
part
before
the
rest
we
dont
have
the
time
to
send
out
missing
parts
by
mail
so
dont
ask
notes
such
as
refer
to
the
reference
list
in
the
last
part
the

of

for
a
few
weeks
always
make
sure
to
read
a
newsgroup
for
some
time
before
you
post
to
it
youll
be
amazed
how
often
the
same
question
can
be
asked
in
the
same
newsgroup
after
a
month
youll
have
a
much
better
sense
of
what
the
readers
want
to
see
do
political
discussions
belong
in
scicrypt
no
in
fact
some
newsgroups
notably
misclegalcomputing
were
created
exactly
so
that
political
questions
like
should
rsa
be
patented
dont
get
in
the
way
of
technical
discussions
many
scicrypt
readers
also
read
misclegalcomputing
comporgefftalk

compcompression

al
for
the
benefit
of
people
who
dont
care
about
those
other
topics
try
to
put
your
postings
in
the
right
group
questions
about
microfilm
and
smuggling
and
other
noncryptographic
spy
stuff
dont
belong
in
scicrypt
either
how
do
i
present
a
new
encryption
scheme
in
scicrypt
i
just
came
up
with
this
neat
method
of
encryption
heres
some
ciphertext
fhdsijoywogbujhkfsyuire
is
it
strong
without
a
doubt
questions
like
this
are
the
most
annoying
traffic
on
scicrypt
if
you
have
come
up
with
an
encryption
scheme
providing
some
ciphertext
from
it
is
not
adequate
nobody
has
ever
been
impressed
by
random
gibberish
any
new
algorithm
should
be
secure
even
if
the
opponent
knows
the
full
algorithm
including
how
any
message
key
is
distributed
and
only
the
private
key
is
kept
secret
there
are
some
systematic
and
unsystematic
ways
to
take
reasonably
long
ciphertexts
and
decrypt
them
even
without
prior
knowledge
of
the
algorithm
but
this
is
a
timeconsuming
and
possibly
fruitless
exercise
which
most
scicrypt
readers
wont
bother
with
so
what
do
you
do
if
you
have
a
new
encryption
scheme
first
of
all
find
out
if
its
really
new
look
through
this
faq
for
references
and
related
methods
familiarize
yourself
with
the
literature
and
the
introductory
textbooks
when
you
can
appreciate
how
your
cryptosystem
fits
into
the
world
at
large
try
to
break
it
yourself
you
shouldnt
waste
the
time
of
tens
of
thousands
of
readers
asking
a
question
which
you
could
have
easily
answered
on
your
own
if
you
really
think
your
system
is
secure
and
you
want
to
get
some
reassurance
from
experts
you
might
try
posting
full
details
of
your
system
including
working
code
and
a
solid
theoretical
explanation
to
scicrypt
keep
in
mind
that
the
export
of
cryptography
is
regulated
in
some
areas
if
youre
lucky
an
expert
might
take
some
interest
in
what
you
posted
you
can
encourage
this
by
offering
cash
rewardsfor
instance
noted
cryptographer
ralph
merkle
is
offering
to
anyone
who
can
break
there
are
no
guarantees
if
you
dont
have
enough
experience
then
most
likely
any
experts
who
look
at
your
system
will
be
able
to
find
a
flaw
if
this
happens
its
your
responsibility
to
consider
the
flaw
and
learn
from
it
rather
than
just
add
one
more
layer
of
complication
and
come
back
for
another
round
a
different
way
to
get
your
cryptosystem
reviewed
is
to
have
the
nsa
look
at
it
a
full
discussion
of
this
procedure
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
faq
among
professionals
a
common
rule
of
thumb
is
that
if
you
want
to
design
a
cryptosystem
you
have
to
have
experience
as
a
cryptanalyst
