QUESTIONS
LIKE
THIS
ARE
THE
MOST
ANNOYING
TRAFFIC
ON
SCICRYPT
IF
YOU
HAVE
COME
UP
WITH
AN
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
PROVIDING
SOME
CIPHERTEXT
FROM
IT
IS
NOT
ADEQUATE
NOBODY
HAS
EVER
BEEN
IMPRESSED
BY
RANDOM

ANY
NEW
ALGORITHM
SHOULD
BE
SECURE
EVEN
IF
THE
OPPONENT
KNOWS
THE
FULL
ALGORITHM
INCLUDING
HOW
ANY
MESSAGE
KEY
IS
DISTRIBUTED
AND
ONLY
THE
PRIVATE
KEY
IS
KEPT
SECRET
THERE
ARE
SOME
SYSTEMATIC
AND
UNSYSTEMATIC
WAYS
TO
TAKE
REASONABLY
LONG
CIPHERTEXTS
AND
DECRYPT
THEM
EVEN
WITHOUT
PRIOR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
BUT
THIS
IS
A
TIMECONSUMING
AND
POSSIBLY
FRUITLESS
EXERCISE
WHICH
MOST
SCICRYPT
READERS
WONT
BOTHER

INTRODUCTORY

WHEN
YOU
CAN
APPRECIATE
HOW
YOUR
CRYPTOSYSTEM
FITS
INTO
THE

TRY
TO
BREAK
IT
YOURSELF
YOU
SHOULDNT
WASTE
THE
TIME
OF
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
READERS
ASKING
A
QUESTION
WHICH
YOU
COULD
HAVE
EASILY
ANSWERED
ON
YOUR
OWN
IF
YOU
REALLY
THINK
YOUR
SYSTEM
IS
SECURE
AND
YOU
WANT
TO
GET
SOME
REASSURANCE
FROM
EXPERTS
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
POSTING
FULL
DETAILS
OF
YOUR
SYSTEM
INCLUDING
WORKING
CODE
AND
A
SOLID
THEORETICAL
EXPLANATION
TO
SCICRYPT
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
THE
EXPORT
OF
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS
REGULATED
IN
SOME
AREAS
IF
YOURE
LUCKY
AN

MIGHT

THERE
ARE
NO
GUARANTEES
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
ENOUGH
EXPERIENCE
THEN
MOST
LIKELY
ANY
EXPERTS
WHO
LOOK
AT
YOUR
SYSTEM
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
FIND
A
FLAW
IF
THIS
HAPPENS
ITS
YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
CONSIDER
THE
FLAW
AND
LEARN
FROM
IT
RATHER
THAN
JUST
ADD
ONE
MORE
LAYER
OF
COMPLICATION
AND
COME
BACK
FOR
ANOTHER
ROUND
A
DIFFERENT
WAY
TO
GET
YOUR
CRYPTOSYSTEM
REVIEWED
IS
TO
HAVE
THE
NSA
LOOK
AT
IT
A
FULL
DISCUSSION
OF
THIS
PROCEDURE
IS
OUTSIDE
THE
SCOPE
OF
THIS
FAQ
AMONG
PROFESSIONALS
A
COMMON
RULE
OF
THUMB
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
DESIGN
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
YOU
HAVE
TO
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
AS

CRYPTANALYST
