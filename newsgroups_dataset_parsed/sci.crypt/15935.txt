COURT
ORDER
IN

MGCSPRINCETONEDU
MICHAEL
GOLAN
WRITES
SOMETHING
THAT
NO
ONE
HAS
DISCUSSED
YET
OR
I
MISSED
IT
THE
FBI
SETS
UP
A
WIRETAP
AFTER
THE
COURT
ORDER
WAS
HANDED
ONLY
AT
THIS
POINT
THEY
CAN
ACCESS
THE
LINE
AND
DETECT
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
N
WHAT
HAPPENS
NEXT
DOES
THE
FBI
SIMPLY
ASKS
FOR
THE
KEYS
FOR
N
AND
SINCE
A
WARRANT
WAS
ISSUED
FOR
THE
LINE
THE
FBI
SIMPLY
GETS
IT
WHAT
IF
MULTIPLE
PHONES
ARE
USED
FROM
THE
SAME
HOUSE
THE
FBI
JUST
ASKS
FOR
ETC
EXACTLY
WHO
IS
TO
PREVENT
THE
FBI
FROM
CLAIMING
SOME
OTHER
SERIAL
NUMBER
X
WAS
ALSO
USED
OVER
THE
WIRTAPPED
LINE
AND
GET
THE
KEYS
FOR
X
EITHER
A
SECOND
COURT
ORDER
FOR
THE
SPECIFIC
SERIALKEY
IS
REQUIRED
AND
I
HAVE
SEEN
NO
INDICATION
OF
THIS
OR
THE
FBI
CAN
EFFECTIVELY
ASK
FOR
ANY
PAIR
OF
KEYS
AT
ANY
TIME
SO
THE
ESCROW
KEY
HOLDERS
ARE
A
TOTAL
FAKE
TWO
SAFEGUARDS
THE
FBI
COULD
BE
ASKED
TO
PRODUCE
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
BLOCK
TO
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
AND
ASSOCIATE
IT
WITH
A
PARTICULAR
COURT
ORDER
IF
THE
THING
COMES
TO
TRIAL
THE
DEFENSE
ATTORNEYS
CAN
PROBE
THIS
ISSUE
CLOSELY
IT
IS
NOT
TOO
DIFFERENT
FROM
PROVING
THAT
THE
SPEAKER
ON
A
LEGAL
WIRETAP
IS
THE
PERSON
THE
COURT
ORDER
COVERED
PUTTING
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
THIS
QUESTION
IS
NOT
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
PRECLIPPER
QUESTION
WHATS
TO
PREVENT
THE
FBI
FROM
GETTING
A
COURT
ORDER
TO
TAP
AL
CAPONE
AND
THEN
USING
IT
TO
TAP
