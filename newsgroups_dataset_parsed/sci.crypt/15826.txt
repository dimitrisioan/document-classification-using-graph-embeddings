WRITES
SOMEONE

DES
FILE
ENCRYPTION
CODE

IS
IT
LEGAL
FOR

IT
I
BELIEVE
ITS
LEGAL
TO
SEND
DES
CODE
OR
EQUIPMENT
FROM
THE
US
TO
CANADA
WITH
NO
EXPORT

I
THINK
THIS

THE
ONLY
PLACE
YOU

DO
THIS
ALL
OTHER
COUNTRIES
REQUIRE
A
LICENSE
AS
AN
ASIDE
IVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
IT

BE
LEGAL
TO

SOFTWARE
ANYWHERE
IF
YOU
FOLLOW
THESE
RULES
ENCRYPT
YOUR
DES
SOFTWARE
WITH
DES
SEND
THE
ENCRYPTED
SOFTWARE

RECIPIENT
SEND
THE
KEY
TO
THE
RECIPIENT
THE
ONLY
WAY
THE
PERSON
ON
THE
OTHER
END
CAN
USE
YOUR
DES
SOFTWARE
IS
IF
HESHE
ALREADY
HAS
DES
AVAILABLE
OTHERWISE
THEY
CANT
DECRYPT
YOUR
PROGRAM
AND
IT
IS
USELESS
IF
YOUVE
GUARANTEED
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
DES
HAVE
YOU
REALLY
VIOLATED
ANY
LAW
BY
SENDING
IT
TO
THEM
IN
THE
FORM
OF
YOUR
PROGRAM
IM
SURE
ITS
STILL
ILLEGAL
BUT
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
A
GOOD
IDEA
TODD
