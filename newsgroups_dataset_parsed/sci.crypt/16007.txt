JEFF
HUPP
WRITES
THE
NSAS
CHARTER
FORBIDS
THEM
FROM
DOING
ANY
PURELY
DOMESTIC
INTELLIGENCE
WORK
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
EVEN
PROVIDING
ASSISTANCE
IN
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
SKIPJACK
ALGORITHOM
IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
THAT
CHARTER
BUT
AS
WITH
ANY
INTRENCHED
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
THEY
WILL
DO
WHAT
THEY
THINK
IS
EXPEDENT
THERE
ARE
OTHER
LAWS
AND
DIRECTIVES
WHICH
BEAR
UPON
THE
SUBJECT
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
NATIONAL
COMPUTER
SECURITY
ACT
OF
SPECIFICALLY
DIRECTS
NBS
SIC
TO
WORK
WITH
NSA
ON
DEVELOPING
SECURITY
STANDARDS
FOR
CIVILIAN
FEDERAL
COMPUTERS
PICK
UP
THE
BILL
FROM
CPSRORG
IT
ALSO
INCLUDES
A
REPORT
DESCRIBING
IT
AND
SOME
OF
THE
LEGISLATIVE
HISTORY
INCLUDING
CONCERNS
ABOUT
NSAS
INVOLVEMENT
NOTE
ALSO
THAT
NSA
IS
SPECIFICALLY
CHARGED
WITH
RUNNING
THE
NATIONAL
COMPUTER
SECURITY
CENTER
TO
QUOTE
THE
AFOREMENTIONED
REPORT
NSA
ALSO
WILL
WORK
WITH
INDUSTRIES
AT
THE
DOD
COMPUTER
SECURITY
CENTER
TO
DEVELOP
SECURITY
STANDARDS
FOR
PRIVATE
SECTOR
USE
IT
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
HAVE
NSA
TINKERING
WITH
THIS
BUT
IM
PRETTY
SURE
ITS
LEGAL
BTW
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
DEVELOPMENT
OF
CRYPTOSYSTEMS
THERE
MAY
BE
TWO
CHOICES
EITHER
NSA
HELPED
DEVELOP
IT
IN
WHICH
CASE
MAYBE
THEY
CAN
CRACK
IT
MAYBE
NOT
BUT
PROBABLY
NO
ONE
ELSE
CAN
OR
NSA
DIDNT
HELP
IN
WHICH
CASE
THEY
PROBABLY
CAN
CRACK
IT
AND
MAYBE
OTHERS
AS
WELL
