if
it

would
be
highly
amusing
since
rsacom
actually
public
key
partners

its
the

entity
is
the
organization
holding
the
patents
which
they
claim
are
violated
if
you
actually
make
use
or
sell
pgp
i
believe
those
patents
also
apply
in
canada
but
im
not
a
patent
lawyer
or
anything
the
patents
dont
apply
in
canada
i
think
the
free
trade
agreement
may
provide
for
recognition
of
new
patents
but
not
old
ones
