nothing
im

be
of
the

a
typical
example

thinking
we
all
know
that
david

is
a
jerk
but
im
afraid
that
in
this
case
of
the
population
will
think
like
him

dorothy
denning
and
the
us
government
have
already
won
the
battle
unless
unless
you
succeed
to
wake
up
the
people
but
nah
thats
too
unlikely
the
events
are
happening
too
fast
cryptography
is
a
too
sophisticated
issue
and

nobody
cares

of
netreaders
wont
make
the

if
millions
are
caught
asleep
too
