re
key
registering
bodies
from
arthur

john

writes
since
the
law
requires
that
wiretaps
be
requested
by
the
executive
branch
and
approved
by
the
judicial
branch
it
seems
clear
that
one
of
the
key
registering
bodies
should
be
under
the
control
of
the
judicial
branch
i
suggest
the
supreme
court
or
regionally
the
courts
of
appeal
more
specifically
the
offices
of
their
clerks
now
that
makes
sense
but
the
other
half
must
be
in
a
nongovernment
escrow
i
still
like
eff
but
i
admin
their
security
has
not
been
tested
