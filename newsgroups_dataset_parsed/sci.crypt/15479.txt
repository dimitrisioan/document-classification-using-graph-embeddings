screw
the
people
crypto
is
for
hardcore
hackers
spooks
only
since
the
att
wiretap
chip
is
scheduled
to
be
distributed
internationally
allowing
the
us
government
to
spy
on
foreign
governments
companies
and
people
as
as
well
as
to
wiretap
domestic
citizens
this
is
a
worldwide
issue
thus
distribution
world

the
jester
writes
however
assuming
that
i
can
still
encrypt
things
as
i
please
who
cares
about
the
clipper
chip
why
do
we
hackers
care
about
the
clipper
chip
do
we
give
a
shit
about
anybodys
privacy
accept
our
own
and
perhaps
not
even
our
own
are
we
so
smart
that
we
always
know
when
were
talking
to
somebody
who
has
a
wiretap
on
their
phone
i
find
the
call
thru
your
computer
ideas
may
reflect
this
attitude
ideas
that
are
of
by
and
for
hackers
and
dont
help
anybody
in
the
real
world
arent
going
to
do
anybody
much
good
including
ourselves
where
voice
phones
are
concerned
we
do
need
an
alternative
to
nsabugged
telephones
but
were
talking
inexpensive
telephones
here
including
handsized
cellulars
that
need
strong
crypto
real
privacy
makeshift
computer
hacker
rigs
that
require
living
by
your
computer
to
talk
privately
over
the
phone
are
just
a
dumb
stunt
that
doesnt
do
anything
for
anybodys
privacy
in
the
real
world
what
we
need
is
a
true
privacy
chip
for
example
a
realtime
voiceencryption
rsa
silicon
compile
it
and
spit
out
asic
put
this
chip
on
the
market
as
a
de
facto
standard
for
international
business
diplomats
and
private
communications
if
the
us
bans
it
we
make
it
somewhere
else
and
import
it
the
japanese
german
dutch
taiwanese
korean
etc
electronics
companies
dont
want
the
nsa
spying
on
them
us
workers
lose
more
jobs
to
government
fascist
stupidity
