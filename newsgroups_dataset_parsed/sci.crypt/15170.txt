ANDREW
S
HALL
WRITES
I
AM
POSTIVE
SOMEONE
WILL
CORRECT
ME
IF
I
AM
WRONG
BUT
DOESNT
THE
FIFTH
ALSO
COVER
NOT
BEING
FORCED
TO
DO
ACTIONS
THAT
ARE
SELFINCRIMINATING
EG
THE
POLICE
COULDNT
DEMAND
THAT
YOU
SILENTLY
TAKE
THEM
TO
WHERE
THE
BODY
IS
BURIED
OR
WHERE
THE
MONEY
IS
HIDDEN
BUT
THEY
CAN
MAKE
YOU
PISS
IN
A
JAR
AND
POSSIBLY
PROVIDE
DNA
SEMEN
AND
HAIR
SAMPLES
OR
TO
UNDERGO
TESTS
FOR
GUNPOWDER
RESIDUES
ON
YOUR
HAND
BTW
THAT
WAS
WHY
THE
CHEMICAL
ENGINEER
ARRESTED
IN
THE
WTC
EXPLOSION
THRUST
HIS
HANDS
INTO
A
TOILET
FILLED
WITH
URINE
AS
THE
COPS
WERE
BREAKING
DOWN
THE
DOOR
THE
NITROGEN
IN
THE
URINE
WOULD
MASK
ANY
RESIDUE
FROM
EXPLOSIVES
I
FOUND
IT
INTERESTING
THE
NEWS
REPORTED
HIS
ACTS
BUT
NOT
HIS
REASONS
SOMEWHERE
PERHAPS
A
PRIVACY
GROUP
THEY
DISCUSSED
THE
LEGAL
RAMIFICATIONS
OF
USING
A
PASSWORD
LIKE
I
SHOT
JIMMY
HOFFA
AND
HIS
BODY
IS
IN
A
STORAGE
LOCKER
IN
CAMDEN
A
WHILE
BACK
THE
IMPRESSION
I
GOT
WAS
THAT
REAL
JUDGES
WOULD
DISMISS
ARGUMENTS
THAT
THIS
PASSWORD
IS
SELFINCRIMINATION
AS
FIRSTYEAR
LAW
SCHOOL
SOPHISTRY
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
USE
A
STATEMENT
FOR
A
PASSWORD
HAS
NO
BEARING
ON
THE
VERACITY
OF
THAT
PHRASE
YOU
ARE
NOT
BEING
ASKED
TO
INCRIMIDATE
YOURSELF
EG
WHERE
DID
YOU
BURY
THE
BODY
YOU
ARE
BEING
ASKED
TO
PROVIDE
INFORMATION
NECESSARY
TO
EXECUTE
A
LEGAL
SEARCH
WARRANT
REFUSING
TO
PROVIDE
THE
PASSWORD
IS
AKIN
TO
REFUSING
TO
PROVIDE
A
KEY
TO
A
STORAGE
LOCKER
EXCEPT
THAT
THEY
COULD
ALWAYS
FORCE
THEIR
WAY
INTO
THE
LOCKER
OF
COURSE
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
YOU
HAVE
TO
HELP
THEM
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
THEY
FIND
OR
POINT
OUT
THINGS
THEY
OVERLOOKED
IN
THEIR
SEARCH
