faq
for
scicrypt
part
overview
this
is
the
first
of
ten
parts
of
the
scicrypt
faq
the
parts
are
mostly
independent
but
you
should
read
this
part
before
the
rest
we
dont
have
the
time
to
send
out
missing
parts
by
mail
so
dont
ask
notes
such
as
refer
to
the
reference
list
in
the
last

disclaimer
this
document
is
the
product
of
the
crypt
cabal
a
secret
society
which
serves
the
national
secuuh
no
seriously
were
the
good
guys
and
weve
done
what
we
can
to
ensure
the
completeness
and
accuracy
of
this
document
but
in
a
field
of
military
and
commercial
importance
like
cryptography
you
have
to
expect
that
some
people
and
organizations
consider
their
interests
more
important
than
open
scientific
discussion
trust
only
what
you
can
verify
firsthand
