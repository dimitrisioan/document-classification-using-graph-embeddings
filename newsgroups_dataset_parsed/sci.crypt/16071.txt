the
puzzle
palace
we
had
a
senior
nsa
scientist
in
cambridge
at
one
of
our
workshops
recently
in
fact
he
was
here
when
the
clipper
announcement
was
made
but
we
didnt
learn
of
it
till
after
hed
gone
he
said
on
this
point
that
he
was
forbidden
by
law
to
monitor
conversations
between
us
nationals
and
he
is
a
chap
who
is
very
precise
about
his
choice
of
words
so
i
dont
expect
hed
have
any
qualms
about
monitoring
a
domestic
us
conversation
if
one
of
the
parties
was
an
alien
however
it
got
me
thinking
of
the
navajo
code
talkers
just
imagine
hello
is
that
the
iraqi
mission
in
new
york
this
is
the
iraqi
foreign
ministry
in

i

soandso
yes
indeed
this
is
the
new
york
mission
mustafa
jadid
speaking
also
a
us
citizen
my
social
security
number
is
suchandsuch
here
is
our
report
on
activities
against
the
satan
clinton
ross
this
one
is
easy
they
tape
the
conversation
call
the
fbi
or
secret
service
you
see
activities
against
the
satan
clinton
could
be
construed
as
a
threat
against
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
am
sure
theynsafbiss
have
enough
judges
in
their
collective
pockets
to
have
a

before
the
