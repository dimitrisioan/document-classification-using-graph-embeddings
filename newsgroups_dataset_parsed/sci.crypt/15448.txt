re
more
technical
details
another
objection
occurred
to
me
there
was
a
comment
about
how
supposedly
there
would
only
be
one
decode
box
operated
by
the
fbi
this
is
flat
ridiculous
and
i
dont
believe
it
for
a
millisecond
even
if
they
in
fact
only
build
one
or
two
or
some
other
small
number
of
these
that
wont
stop
others
from
building
one
make
it
work
like
two
clipperchip
phones
one
listening
to
each
side
of
the
recorded
conversation
ill
have
to
have
another
look
at
the
specs
posted
so
far
but
offhand
i
didnt
see
anything
that
would
preclude
this
sort
of
thing
