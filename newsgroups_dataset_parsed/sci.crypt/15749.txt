RUSSELL
WRITES
AT
THE
COMPANY
I
WORKED
FOR
PREVIOUSLY
I
RECEIVED
A
FILE
THAT
WAS
DES
ENCRYPED
AND
THE
PERSON
THAT
HAD
SENT
IT
WENT
ON
VACTION
RATHER
THAN
WAIT
TWO
WEEKS
I
SET
UP
A
STRAIGHT
FRONTAL
ATTACK
WITH
ONE
KEY
AT
A
TIME
IT
ONLY
TOOK
DAYS
TO
CRACK
THE
FILE
TAKING
THIS
AT

VALUE
THOUGH
IT
SEEMS
QUITE
DISSONANT
WITH
MUCH
ELSE
THAT
HAS
BEEN

HERE
ABOUT
BRUTE

CRACKING
UNLESS
RUSSELL
WAS
LUCKY
WITH

TO

BE
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
WHETHER
THE

RUSSELL
USED
IS
AVAILABLE
IN
WHETHER
HE
USED
A

IN
THE

OR
WHETHER
HE
HAD

IN
WHETHER
HE
USED
A

ATTACK
THIS
HAS
TO
BE
A
DICTIONARY
ATTACK
NO
OTHER
ATTACK
MAKES
SENSE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
WHOEVER
ENCRYPTED
THE
FILE
JUST
TYPED
SOME
PASSWORD
WHICH
WAS
A
SINGLE
DICTIONARY
WORD
AND
THEN
RUSSELL
TRIED
ALL
THE
WORDS
IN
THE
DICTIONARY
THIS
ISNT
TOO
IMPLAUSIBLE
ESPECIALLY
IF
HE
WAS
SMART

CLIPPED
THE

IF
THE

OBVIOUSLY
