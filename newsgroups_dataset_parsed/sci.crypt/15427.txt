asset
forfeiture
super
surplus
fund
to

this
purchase
talk
about
adding
insult
to
injury
i
for
one
believe
that
the
use
of
civil
forfeiture
should
be
abolished
by
a
decent
administration
not
continued
instead
it
looks
like
that
illgotten
gain
will
be
used
to
help
pay
for
wiretap
equipment
i
wholeheartedly
agree
knowing
that
we
have
let
our
law
enforcement
agencies
seize
our
property
against
the
fifth
amendment
of
our
constitution
tells
me
that
we
are
absolving
ourselves
of
our
responsibility
for
selfgovernance
we
have
to
take
our
government
back
from
the
selfserving
politicians
who
create
laws
and
rules
only
to
better
their
positions
within
the
government
we
have
allowed
them
to
take
too
much
power
from
the
people
of
this
nation
that
situation
has
to
be
changed
allowing
the
law
enforcement
agencies
to
use
the
seized
property
to
payoff
drug
informants
who
lie
and
continue
to
deal
in
drugs
is
tantamount
to
making
a
pact
with
the
devil
himself
its
a
vicious
cycle
the
law
enforcement
agencies
are
motivated
to
seize
property
to
fund
their
own
activities
and
having
no
easy
way
for
the
citizen
to
regain
the
property
intact
once
taken
gives
even
more
incentive
for
the
agencies
to
take
property
its
also
interesting
to
note
that
two
months
ago
rush
limbaugh
said
that
clinton
would
have
the
plumbers
out
in
force
shortly
clinton
and
his
henchmen
firmly
believe
in
strong
ubiquitous
government
control
anytime
a
leader
believes
in
that
the
leader
will
use
every
means
possible
to
retain
that
control
and
take
more
we
have
to
take
our
government
back
otherwise
we
will
end
up
living
in
the
equivalent
of
a
hightech
third
world
dictatorship
we
have
to
take
responsibility
for
ourselves
our
personal
welfare
and
our
actions
