re
off
the
shelf
cheap
des
keyseach
machine
was
re
corporate
acceptance
of
the
wiretap
chip
thousands
tens
of
thousands
do
some
arithmetic
please
skipjack
has
possible
keys
we
dont
yet
know
if
all
bits
count
that
doesnt
worry
me
at
all
theyre
not
going
to
cheat
at
something
they
can
get
caught
at
and
key
size
is
one
of
the
things
that
can
be
verified
externally
feed
lots
of
random
keyinput
pairs
into
the
chip
then
see
what
happens
to
the
output
if
the
device
is
designed
to
use
the
key
thats
registered
with
the
feds
i
dont
see
how
you
can
feed
it
a
different
key
if
the
user
can
change
the
key
to
any
of
the
possibilities
the
main
reason
for
regarding
this
proposal
as
unacceptable
disappears
