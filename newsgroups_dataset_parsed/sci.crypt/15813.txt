RE
FEAR
UNCERTAINTY
DOUBT
MORE
ACCURATE
IS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SAYS
ITS
SOLID
OTHER
PEOPLE
IN
THE
FIELD
WHO
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
FIND
OUT
HAVENT
YET
DONE
THEIR
REVIEW
OF
THE
CHIP
DESIGN
AND
THERES
BEEN
A
LOT
OF
WILD
SPECULATION
AND
GUESSWORK
FROM
THOSE
WITH
LITTLE
INFORMATION
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
SWISS
CHEESE
OH
THAT
PUTS
THE
DEBATE
ON
EXCELLENT
TERMS
FOR
OUR
SIDE
FEDS
YOU
PEOPLE
SAYING
THAT
CLIPPER
IS
INSECURE
DONT
HAVE
ANY
REAL
INFORMATION
TO
SUPPORT
THAT
JUDGMENT
ME
FINE
SHOW
ME
THIS
INFORMATION
THAT
WOULD
PROVE
ME
WRONG
FEDS
THATS
SECRET
WHEN
IT
COMES
DOWN
TO
THAT
IT
LOOKS
SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE
SOME
GOVERNMENT
OFFICIAL
PASTING
TOP
SECRET
STAMPS
OVER
EMBARRASING
INFORMATION
IN
ORDER
TO
SAVE
HIS
OWN
HIDE
IN
FACT
FRAMING
THE
SECRECY
ISSUE
IN
THAT
PERSPECTIVE
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
TURN
JOE
SIXPACKS
SUSPICIONS
AGAINST
THE
FEDS
THAN
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
ARGUMENT
A
POINT
I
URGE
THE
OTHERS
ON
THE
PROFREEDOM
SIDE
TO
CONSIDER
WHEN
MAKING
THEIR
CASE
