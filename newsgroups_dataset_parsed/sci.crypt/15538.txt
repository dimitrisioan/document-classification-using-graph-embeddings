RE
WH
PROPOSAL
FROM
POLICE
POINT
OF
VIEW
IN
ARTICLE
TUINSTRASUNSPOTECECLARKSONEDUSOE
DWIGHT
TUINSTRA
WRITES
IT
MIGHT
PAY
TO
START
LOOKING
AT
WHAT
THIS
PROPOSAL
MIGHT
MEAN
TO
A
POLICE
AGENCY
IT
JUST
MIGHT
BE
A
BAD
IDEA
FOR
THEM
TOO
OK
SUPPOSE
THE
NY
STATE
POLICE
WANT
TO
TAP
A
SUSPECTS
PHONE
THEY
NEED
A
WARRANT
JUST
LIKE
THE
OLD
DAYS
BUT
UNLIKE
THE
OLD
DAYS
THEY
NOW
NEED
TO
A
GET
TWO
FEDERAL
AGENCIES
TO
GIVE
THEM
THE
TWO
PARTS
OF
THE
KEY
NOW
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
THERES
A
TIFF
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
ESCROW
HOUSES
POSESSIONRELEASE
OF
KEYS
BECOMES
A
POLITICAL
BARGAINING
CHIT
WHILE
I
THINK
IT
IS
UNREALISTIC
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
FEDERAL
AGENCIES
WILL
FAIL
TO
PROMPTLY
COMPLY
WITH
A
COURT
ORDER
THERE
IS
STILL
A
GOOD
POINT
HERE
LOCAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WILL
BE
UNABLE
TO
PERFORM
A
WIRETAP
WITHOUT
BRINGING
IN
FEDERAL
AGENCIES
BASED
ON
THE
POSSIBLY
INCOMPLETE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
SYSTEM
QUOTED
FROM
D
DENNING
ONLY
THE
FBI
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
DECRYPT
THE
SYSTEM
KEY
ENCRYPTION
LAYER
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
NEEDED
EVEN
TO
IDENTIFY
WHAT
ESCROWED
KEYS
TO
REQUEST
THIS
MOVES
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
POWER
TO
THE
FEDERAL
LEVEL
THE
REASON
I
LIKE
THIS
POINT
IS
THAT
IT
MAY
SWAY
OR
EVEN
PERSUADE
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
GENERALLY
LINE
UP
WITH
THE
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
CROWD
A
NATIONAL
POLICE
FORCE
IS
OPPOSED
BY
PEOPLE
FROM
A
BROAD
RANGE
OF
POLITICAL
VIEWPOINTS
