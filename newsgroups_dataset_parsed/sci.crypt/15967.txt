hell
just
set
up
a
spark
jammer
or
some
other
very
electricallynoisy
device
or
build
an
active
farrady
cage
around
the
room
with
a
noise
signal
piped
into
it
while
these
measures
will
not
totally
mask
the
emissions
of
your
equipment
they
will
provide
sufficient
interference
to
make
remote
monitoring
a
chancy
proposition
at
best
there
is
of
course
the
consideration
that
these
measures
may
and
almost
cretainly
will
cause
a
certain
amount
of
interference
in
your
own
systems
its
a
matter
of
balancing
security
versus
convenience
the
problem
is
that
this
will
also
cause
a
certain
amount
of
interference
in
all
systems
within
the
range
of
the
device
a
long
time
ago
i
built
a
small
jammer
to
dissuade
my
brother
from
using
his
radio
alarm
clock
at
something
like
which
had
just
enough
range
to
cover
my
room
and
his
however
something
powerful
enough
to
mask
all
or
at
least
most
emissions
from
your
computer
equipment
is
also
going
to
knock
out
half
your
neighbourhoods
radio
and
tv
reception
this
isnt
going
to
make
you
many
friends
incidentally
an
oldermodel
makes
a
fine
wideband
jammer
