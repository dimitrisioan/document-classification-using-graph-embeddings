IM
AFRAID

SLIGHTLY

PKWARE

OBTAINED
A

VERY
LIMITED

DRAW
YOUR

ABOUT
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
SORRY
IF
I
WAS
LESS
THAN
CLEAR
I
WAS
REFERRING
TO
OUR
OWN
EFFORTS
TO
RECEIVE
EXPORT
PERMISSION
FROM

FOR
THE
PKZIP

ALGORITHM
NOT
TO
ANY
EFFORT
ON
THE
PART
OF
PHIL
KATZ
OR
PKWARE
I
SHOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
VERSION
OF
THIS
ALGORITHM
WAS
DESIGNED
BY
ROGER
SCHLAFLY
AND
THAT
WE
MEANING
ROGER
AND
MYSELF
WERE
TWICE
DENIED
AN
EXPORT

FOR
IT
THE
SECOND
GO
ROUND
WAS
JUST
THIS
PAST

I
HAD
NO
KNOWLEDGE
OF
PHILS
ATTEMPTS
IN
THIS
I
DO
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
FOR
SURE
IF
HE
CHOOSE
TO
IMPLEMENT
THE
ALGORITHM
AS
IT
WAS
DESIGNED
BY
ROGER
THOUGH
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WAS
AT
LEAST
THE
CASE
FOR
VERSIONS
PRIOR
TO
AND
THEN
THERES
THE
QUESTION
OF
KEY
MANAGEMENT
AND
EVEN
IF
OUR
APPLICATIONS
WERE
IDENTICAL
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
ASSUME
THE
NSA
WOULD
TREAT
THEM
THAT
WAY
