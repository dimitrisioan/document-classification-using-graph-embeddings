UNLIKE

DES
USES

HOWEVER
DES

MUCH
FASTER

RIPEM
USES
BOTH
DES

IT
GENERATES
A
RANDOM

IN

ALLOWING
THE

DES

SOMETIMES
CONSIDERED
WEAK
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SOMEWHAT
OLD
AND
USES
A

CONSIDERED
TOO
SHORT
BY
MODERN
STANDARDS
HOWEVER
IT
SHOULD
BE
REASONABLY
SAFE
AGAINST
AN
OPPONENT
SMALLER

A
LARGE

IT
IS
NOT
LIKELY
THAT
THE
PEM

WILL
INCORPORATE
SUPPORT

BECAUSE
THERE
IS
A
