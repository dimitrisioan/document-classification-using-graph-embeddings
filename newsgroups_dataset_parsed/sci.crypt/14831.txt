running

archive
of

information
it
does
not
contain
much

has

primarily
by

most
of

for
the
rsa

which
are
a

called

how

ripem
ripem
uses
the

rsaref

is
considered

thus

exportrestricted
from

to
persons
who
are
not

in

without
an

no
such

has
been
obtained
nor
would
one
likely
be
granted
unless
the
rsa
key
exchange
were
shortened
to
bits
and
the
symmetric

changed
to
something
weaker
than
des
there
are
some
suggestions
that
this

may
change
now
that

that
this

not
be

please
do
not
export
the

outside

this
is
a
personal
request
from
me
the
author
of
ripem
and
a
condition
of
your
use
of
ripem
note
that
rsaref
is
not
in
the
public
domain
and
a
license
for
it
is
included
with
the

you
should
read
it
before
using
ripem
ripem
is
available
via
anonymous
ftp
to
citizens

in

from

cd
to
rsaref
and
read
the

for

note
that
the
nonrsaref
portion
of
ripem
is
not
a
product
of
rsa
data
security
incorporated
they
merely
are
helping
distribute
it
ripem
as
well
as
some
other

stuff
has
its
home
site
on
ripemmsuedu
which
is
open
to
nonanonymous

in
addition
to
the
full

tree
will

probably
it

lau

more
ports
are
expected
and
help
of
users
is
invited
will
ripem
work
with
my
mailer
probably
how
easy
and
clean
the
effective
interface
is
will
depend
on
the
sophistication
and
modularity
of
the
mailer
though
the
users
guide
included
with
the
distribution
discusses
ways
to
use
ripem
with
many
popular
mailers
including
berkeley
mush
elm
and
mh
code
is
also
included
in
elisp
to
allow
easy
use
of
ripem
inside
gnu
emacs
if
you
make
a
new
interface
for
ripem
or
create
an
improvement
on
one
in
the
distribution
which
you
believe
is
convenient
to
use

may
be
useful

altsecurityripem
what
is
rsa
rsa
is
a
crypto
system
which
is
asymmetric
or
publickey
this
means
that
there
are
two
different
related
keys
one
to
encrypt
and
one
to
decrypt
because
one
cannot
reasonably
be
derived
from
the
other
you
may
publish
your
encryption
or
public
key
widely
and
keep
your
decryption
or
private
key
to
yourself
anyone
can
use
your
public
key
to
encrypt
a
message
but
only
you
hold
the
private
key
needed
to
decrypt
it
note
that
the
message
sent
with
rsa
is
normally
just
the
des
key
to
the
real
plaintext
see
what
is
des
note
that
the
above
only
provides
for
disclosure
protection
for
originator
authenticity
message
integrity
and
nonrepudiation
of
origin
services
to
be
implemented
the
fingerprint
of
the
message
see
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
encrypted
with
the
senders
private
key
the
recipient
or
a
disputeresolving
authority
can
use
the
senders
public
key
to
decrypt
it
and
confirm
that
the
message
must
have
come
from
the
sender
and
was
not
altered
rsa
was
named
for
the
three
men
rivest
shamir
and
adleman
who
invented
it
to
find
out
lots
more
about
rsa
and
modern
cryptography
in
general
ftp
to
rsacom
and
look
in
pubfaq
some
information
also
may
be
in
scicrypt
what
is
des
des
is
the
data
encryption
standard
a
widely
used
symmetric
or
secretkey
crypto
system
unlike
rsa
des
uses
the
same
key
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
messages
however
des
is
much
faster
than
rsa
ripem
uses
both
des
and
rsa
it
generates
a
random
key
and
encrypts
your
mail
with
des
using
that
key
it
then
encrypts
that
key
with
the
recipients
public
rsa
key
and
includes
the
result
in
the
letter
allowing
the
recipient
to
recover
the
des
key
des
is
sometimes
considered
weak
because
it
is
somewhat
old
and
uses
a
key
length
considered
too
short
by
modern
standards
however
it
should
be
reasonably
safe
against
an
opponent
smaller
than
a
large
corporation
or
government
agency
it
is
not
likely
that
the
pem
standard
will
incorporate
support
for
other
symmetric
ciphers
in
the
near
future
because
there
is
a
strong
feeling
that
pem
should
be
stable
so
it
can
become
utilized
widely
without
early
problems
with
interoperability
what
is
a
fingerprint
like
is
a
message
digest
algorithm
produced
by
rsa
data
security
inc
it
provides
a
fingerprint
or
cryptographically
secure
hash
of
the
plaintext
it
is
cryptographically
secure
because
it
is
not
possible
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
computation
to
produce
a
different
plaintext
which
produces
the
same
fingerprint
thus
instead
of
signing
the
entire
message
with
the
senders
private
key
only
the
of
the
message
needs
to
be
signed
for
authentication
can
also
be
exchanged
directly
for
authentication
for
example
ripem
public
keys
include
an
of
the
public
key
in
the
file
so
parties
wishing
to
confirm
their
keys
are
authentic
via
a
separate
channel
merely
need
exchange
of
keys
and
verify
their
accuracy
is
sometimes
used
for
other
purposes
for
example
it
is
often
used
to
map
an
input
of
arbitrary
length
to
bits
of
data
as
a
passphrase
interpreter
or
cookie
generator
is
described
in
its
entirety
including
an
implementation
in
c
in
rfc
there
have
been
some
recent
suggestions
that
may
not
be
as
strong
a
hash
as
was
originally
believed
presumably
some
other
hash
function
will
be
used
if
this
is
accepted
as
true
what
is
pem
pem
is
privacy
enhanced
mail
a
standard
for
allowing
transfer
of
encrypted
electronic
mail
generated
over
a
long
period
of
time
by
a
working
group
of
experts
it
is
described
in
rfcs
these
documents
have
been
approved
and
obsolete
the
old
rfcs
ripem
is
not
really
a
complete
implementation
of
pem
because
pem
specifies
certificates
for
authenticating
keys
which
ripem
does
not
handle
at
this
time
their
addition
is
planned
whats
this
about
distributing
and
authenticating
keys
for
a
remote
user
to
be
able
to
send
secure
mail
to
you
she
must
know
your
public
key
for
you
to
be
able
to
confirm
that
the
message
received
came
from
her
you
must
know
her
public
key
it
is
important
that
this
information
be
accurate
if
a
bad
guy
convinces
her
that
his
key
is
in
fact
yours
she
will
send
messages
which
he
can
read
ripem
allows
for
three
methods
of
key
management
a
central
server
the
distributed
finger
servers
and
a
flat
file
all
three
are
described
in
the
ripem
users
guide
which
is
part
of
the
distribution
none
of
them
provide
perfect
security
the
pem
standard
calls
for
key
management
by
certificates
the
addition
of
this
feature
to
ripem
is
planned
but
chickenegg
issues
still
exist
isnt
it
a
bad
idea
to
use
patented
algorithms
in
standards
like
pem
this
issue
has
been
considered
in
the
standards
process
rfc
the
specification
for
internet
standards
has
a
discussion
section
on
what
specifications
for
nondiscriminatory
availability
must
be
met
for
a
patented
method
to
be
included
in
a
standard
rfc
addresses
this
issue
with
regard
to
the
patents
covering
publickey
cryptography
this
does
not
of
course
mean
that
all
questions
are
settled
or
that
everyone
is
in
agreement
an
interesting
exchange
on
the
use
of
patented
algorithms
in
standards
with

to
publickey

what
about
rsadsipkp
rsa
data
security
inc
rsadsi
is
a
californiabased
company
specializing
in
cryptographic
technologies
public
key
partners
is
a
firm
which
holds
exclusive
sublicensing
rights
of

pkp
claims
these
four
patents
cover
all
known
methods
of
public
key
cryptography
the
two
businesses
are
rather
closely
related
for
example
the
same
person
jim
bidzos
is
president
of
both
of
them
pkp
has
licensed
this
technology
to
a
considerable
number
of
companies
ibm
dec
motorola
att
lotus
for
use
in
their
products
pkp
has
also
threatened
and
filed
lawsuits
defending
their
patents
ripem
was
originally
created
with
no
connection
to
rsadsi
other
than
its
use
of
the
rsaref
library
and
for
no
reason
other
than
its
authors
desire
to
see
widespread
use
of
publickey
cryptography
however
after
the
ball
started
rolling
people
at
rsadsi
got
interested
rsadsi
decided
to
carry
ripem
on
its
ftp
site
and
some
people
there
started
making
their
own
ripem
keys
and
contributing
code
ripem
even
won
the
best
application
built
on
rsaref
in
award
why
do
all
ripem
public
keys
look
very
similar
ripem
public
keys
begin
with
a
pkcs
publickey
cryptography
standards
identifier
describing
various
characteristics
about
the
key
so
the
first
bunch
of
characters
in
your
key
may
be
the
same
as
those
of
lots
of
other
peoples
keys
this
does
not
mean
your
keys
are
similar
but
only
that
they
are
the
same
class
of
key
were
generated
with
the
same
program
are
of
the
same
length
etc
what
is
pgp
pgp
is
another
cryptographic
mail
program
called
pretty
good
privacy
pgp
has
been
around
longer
than
ripem
and
works
somewhat
differently
pgp
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
in
any
way
though
pgp
does
also
use
rsa
a
few
major
differences
between
pgp
and
ripem
pgp
has
more
key
management
features
particularly
for
users
without
a
direct
network
connection
ripem
conforms
to
the
pem
rfcs
and
thus
has
a
greater
probability
of
working
with
other
pem
software
pgp
makes
no
attempt
to
be
compatible
with
anything
other
than
itself
ripem
uses
rsaref
a
library
of
rsa
routines
from
rsadsi
which
comes
with
a
license
allowing
noncommercial
use
pgp
uses
its
own
implementation
of
rsa
pkp
claims
that
it
is
a
violation
of
its
patents
to
make
use
or
sell
pgp
in
the
us
or
canada
without
either
a
license
or
written
permission
see
disclaimer
see
what
about
rsadsipkp
phil
zimmermann
the
author
of
pgp
stopped
distributing
it
after
being
threatened
with
legal
action
he
believed
that
a
licensing
scheme
could
be
arranged
but
it
hasnt
happened
and
there
seems
little
prospect
of
it
happening
in
the
future
he
acknowledges
in
the
pgp
users
guide
in
fact
if
you
live
in
the
usa
and
you
are
not
a
federal
agency
you
shouldnt
actually
run
pgp
on
your
computer
because
public
key
partners
wants
to
forbid
you
from
running
my
software
pgp
is
contraband
both
pgp
and
ripem
are
exportrestricted
and
cannot
be
sent
outside
the
us
and
canada
without
an
export
license
however
pgp
already
exists
on
many
ftp
sites
in
europe
and
other
places
whether
you
use
pgp
or
ripem
or
whatever
the
documentation
to
pgp
is
recommended
reading
to
anyone
interested
in
such
issues
unfortunately
its
not
distributed
separately
from
the
program
which
can
be
difficult
to
find
in
the
us
on
ftp
sites
due
to
liability
concerns
what
about
rpem
rpem
stands
for
rabin
privacy
enhanced
mail
it
was
similar
to
ripem
but
used
a
publickey
cipher
invented
by
rabin
which
is
not
rsa
in
an
attempt
to
avoid
the
patents
on
publickey
systems
it
was
written
by
mark
riordan
who
later
wrote
ripem
its
distribution
was
halted
when
contrary
to
the
beliefs
of
many
including
rabin
pkp
claimed
that
their
patents
were
broad
enough
to
cover
the
cipher
employed
this
claim
is
not
universally
accepted
but
was
not
challenged
for
pragmatic
reasons
rpem
is
not
really
used
anymore
it
is
not
compatible
with
ripem
or
pgp
what
is
mime
mime
stands
for
multipurpose
internet
mail
extensions
and
is
described
in
rfc
you
can
find
out
about
it
in
the
newsgroup
compmailmime
a
faq
exists
on
it
how
pem
should
interact
with
mime
is
not
yet
entirely
clear
some
people
use
the
stopgap
solution
of
having
a
mime
type
applicationxripem
in
order
to
send
ripem
messages
as
mime
ones
i
hope
some
standards
will
emerge

last
i
heard
it
was
rumored
to
be

into
an
existing

agent
mh
rather
than
a
standalone
system
and
in
beta
test
i
dont
know
much
more
than
that
i
have
this
simple
way
to
defeat
the
security
of
ripem
you
may
wish
to
check
the
companion

discusses
some
of
the
more
obvious
