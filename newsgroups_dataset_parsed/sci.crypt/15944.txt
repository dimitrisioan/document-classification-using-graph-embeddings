re
clipper
considered
harmful
restated
and
amplified
if
the
crooks
use
an
innocent
persons
clipper
phone
on
the
tapped
line
theres
no
problem
the
feds
dont
care
whose
phone
instrument
is
used
just
that
the
conversation
is
by
the
suspect
on
the
tapped
line
they
get
the
serial
number
get
the
keys
and
they
are
in
business
no
clipper
chip
to
person
association
is
ever
needed
yeah
but
who
wants
to
start
a
pool
on
the
first
person
arrested
mistakenly
and
has
their
life
turned
upsidedown
because
some
law
enforcement
agency
does
make
a
chipperson
association
i
wonder
if
there
are
any
plans
to
keep
these
records
eg
encode
the
serial
number
into
the
upc
scanned
at
kmart
along
with
the
credit
card
info
voila
at
least
your
phone
number
tends
to
only
locate
to
your
house
or
whatever
ie
to
be
coming
from
your
telephone
number
the
person
likely
is
in
your
house
etc
plus
or
minus
some
shenanigans
of
course
but
id
hate
to
think
of
these
guys
getting
the
clipper
id
recording
the
conversation
then
doing
a
quick
crosslookup
and
your
name
comes
up
as
owner
of
that
id
mistakenly
maybe
you
sold
the
phone
at
a
garage
sale
or
the
phone
was
stolen
from
your
car
or
whatever
they
might
only
know
who
one
side
of
the
conversation
is
for
example
anyone
who
thinks
the
govt
is
forbidden
by
law
to
crosscorrelate
such
databases
loses
two
points
first
law
enforcement
agencies
can
of
course
do
this
second
theyre
only
forbidden
from
budgeting
any
money
for
it
the
irs
for
example
does
do
this
anyhow
they
just
dont
spend
any
money
on
it
so
its
technically
legal
i
guess
instead
they
probably
trade
little
favors
with
companies
like
mastercard
if
youre
the
irs
ill
bet
you
have
a
lot
of
opportunities
to
trade
favors
with
major
corps
for
their
databases
i
know
an
irs
guy
read
an
amazing
list
off
to
me
from
his
screen
i
could
hear
him
typing
to
pull
up
each
screen
once
on
the
phone
during
a
dispute
i
had
with
them
to
intimidate
me
actually
not
much
of
a
dispute
i
didnt
particularly
disagree
but
for
some
reason
this
fellow
wanted
to
play
tough
guy
with
me
i
hope
hes
better
now
amazing
stuff
he
had
at
his
finger
tips
