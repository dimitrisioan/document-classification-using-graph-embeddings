WROTE
AS
A
PRIVATE
CITIZEN
I
WOULD
FEEL
MUCH
MORE
SECURE
IN
MY
PERSON
AND
PAPERS
KNOWING
THAT
AN
ORGANIZATION
COMMITTED
TO
INDIVIDUAL
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
NRA
COME
TO
MIND
WAS
SAFEGUARDING
HALF
OF
MY
KEY
BOTH
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
NRA
ARE
RESISTENT
TO
GOVERNMENT
PRESSURE
BY
THE
SIMPLE
EXPEDIENT
FACT
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
SUPPORTED
FUNDED
OR
OVERTLY
CONTROLLED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
THATS
ONE
PROBLEM
THAT
HAS
SO
FAR
BEEN
OVERLOOKED
THESE
TWO
ESCROW
AGENCIES
WILL
HAVE
TO
CREATE
A
SECURE
DATABASE
AND
SERVICE
THE
INPUT
AND
OUTPUT
OF
KEYS
WHO
PAYS
FOR
THIS
IF
THEY
REFUSE
AN
ILLEGAL
REQUEST
FROM
SOME
CONGRESSMAN
TO
DELIVER
A
KEY
CAN
THEIR
BUDGET
BY
CUT
TO
PUNISH
THEM
WILL
CONGRESS
BE
FORCED
TO
FUND
THEM
FOREVER
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
LAWS
CAN
CHANGE
CONGRESS
MAY
PASS
A
LAW
SETTING
UP
AN
ESCROW
AGENCY
WITH
INSTRUCTIONS
THAT
KEYS
ARE
PRIVATE
SOME
FUTURE
CONGRESS
MAY
CHANGE
THAT
LAW
SUPPOSE
PRENAZI
GERMANY
HAD
A
CLIPPER
SYSTEM
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
WOULD
HAVE
TOLD
HITLER
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
THE
KEYS
WITHOUT
A
VALID
COURT
ORDER
IN
EFFECT
YOU
MUST
SET
UP
ESCROW
AGENCIES
AS
A
FOURTH
BRANCH
OF
THE
GOVERMENT
AND
ISOLATE
THEM
FROM
ANY
OUTSIDE
INTERFERANCE
THEY
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
DIRECTLY
TAP
INTO
FEDERAL
FUNDS
WITH
NO
ACCOUNTABILITY
TO
ANYONE
EXCEPT
THROUGH
A
COURT
CHALLENGE
