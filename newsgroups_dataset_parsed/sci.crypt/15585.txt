AMANDA
WALKER
WRITES
ONE
THING
THAT
CLIPPER
OFFERS
IS
INTEROPERABILITY
AT
A
HIGHER
DEGREE
OF
SECURITY
THAN
WE
CURRENTLY
HAVE
IN
NONPROPRIETARY
VOICE
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEMS
THIS
MEANS
IT
WILL
BE
CHEAPER
THAN
ANYONES
PROPRIETARY
SCHEME
AND
EASIER
TO
DEPLOY
I
MAY
BE
AN
ANARCHIST
NUTCASE
BUT
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
FROTHED
OVERMUCH
HAD
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROPOSED
A
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
STANDARD
IN
FACT
IF
THE
NSA
HAD
COME
UP
WITH
A
PRIVACY
CHIP
RATHER
THAN
A
WIRETAP
CHIP
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
HAPPY
THEY
COULD
HAVE
DONE
THIS
SET
UP
AN
ANSI
COMMITTEE
PICKED
A
SECURE
CRYPTOSYSTEM
DEFINED
A
PROTOCOL
AND
INTERFACE
AND
SAID
HEY

BUILDING
THEM
INSTEAD

HAVE
A
DELIBERATELY
BRAINDEAD

OF
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
THAT
HAS
NOT
EVEN
BEEN

REMEMBER
IN

THEY
DESCRIBED
THIS
SCHEME
AS
BALANCING
THE
TWO
EXTREMES
OF

AND
CLAIMING
THAT
