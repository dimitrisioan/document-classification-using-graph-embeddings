RE
MY
LETTER
ABOUT
CLIPPER
IN
ARTICLE
STRNLGHTNETCOMCOM
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WRITES
PART
OF
THE
BASIS
FOR
MY
BELIEF
IS
THAT
WE
NSA
HAVE
MORE
PEOPLE
SPEND
MUCH
MORE
MONEY
AND
HAVE
MUCH
BETTER
HARDWARE
THAN
ANYONE
ELSE
THE
SAME
COULD
BE
SAID
FOR
MANY
OTHER
GOVERMENT
AGENCIES
BUT
BIG
BUDGETS
LARGE
STAFFS
AND
LONG
LEAD
TIME
HAVENT
MADE
MANY
OF
THEM
INTO
MODELS
OF
EFFECTIVENESS
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THOSE
OF
US
OUTSIDE
THE
INNER
CIRCLES
HAVE
ONLY
JAMES
BAMFORDS
WORD
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
AT
THE
NSA
USE
THOSE
LEGENDARY
MASSES
OF
COMPUTERS
FOR
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
READING
NETNEWS
LIKE
MANY
OF
US
THE
NSA
DOESNT
HAVE
AN
IMPRESSIVE
RECORD
OF
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
AT
LEAST
NOT
A
PUBLIC
RECORD
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
GREAT
CARE
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
TO
ENSURE
THE
ACCURACY
OF
OUR
INFORMATION
ERRORS
AND
OMISSIONS
EXCEPTED
THIS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
PRICELESS
WHERES
IT
FROM
