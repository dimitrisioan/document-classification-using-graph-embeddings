HMMM
WE
MUST
ASSUME
THAT
GENERATING
THE

U
FROM

N
RATHER
THAN
GENERATING
IT
FROM
A
RANDOMLY

AND
IS
AN
INTENTIONAL
WAY
OF
ASSURING
A

SAFE
FOR

IF

THEY

HOWEVER
MORE
INTERESTINGLY
WE
KNOW
FOR
A
FACT
THAT

NO

IS
NO
MORE
THAN
WHY
NOT

AT

WHY
THIS
INTERESTING
RESTRICTION
OF

IF
IT
NOT
TO
PROVIDE
AN

BACK

I
FIND
IT
DISTURBING
THAT
AT

BEST
MY

IS
DEPENDANT
ON
APPROXIMATELY
BYTES
WORTH
OF

THAT
COULD
BE

EVEN

PERIODICALLY
THE
RATIONALE
BEHIND

RESTRICTION
IN
THE
SIZE
OF

SEEMS
STRANGE
IF

IS
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
GOAL
IS

AND
MAKES
PERFECT
SENSE
IF
THE
GOAL
IS
AN
ILLUSION
OF

IF
AND
DO
NOT

EVEN

REMAIN

I
WONDER

WE
ARE
ASSURED
THAT
THIS
CANNOT
HAPPEN

NO
ONE
UNDERSTANDS
HOW
SKIPJACK
WORKS
OUTSIDE

SOON
FOREIGN

THAT

VIA

PRESUMABLY
WE
WILL

HAVE

GETS

BY
THE

WE
KNOW
IT
MAY
BE
TOO
LATE
PERHAPS
THE

CAN
BE
THE

WHO
COME
UP
WITH
AND
AND
IF
THESE
AGENCIES
ARE
REALLY
TRUSTED
ACLU
NRA
IS
AN
INTERESTING
EXAMPLE
WE
CAN
HOPE
THAT
THEYLL
USE
SOME
PHYSICAL
PROCESS
TO
COME
UP
WITH
TRULY
RANDOM
NUMBERS
IF
THE

COMES
UP
WITH

THATS
A

YOU
COULD
DRIVE

NONE
OF
