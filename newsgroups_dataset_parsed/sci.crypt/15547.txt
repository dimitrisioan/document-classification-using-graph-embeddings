A
LITTLE
POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHY
WORTH
READING
READ
THIS
THROUGH
ONCE
OR
TWICE
THEN
REPLACE
PRINCE
WITH
GOVERNMENT
OR
PRESIDENT
AS
APPROPRIATE
AND
READ
IT
AGAIN
FROM
CHAPTER
XX
OF
THE
PRINCE
BY
N
MACCHIAVELLI
AS
TRANSLATED
BY
DANIEL
DONNO
IN
ORDER
TO
KEEP
THEIR
LANDS
SECURE
SOME
PRINCES
HAVE
DISARMED
THEIR
SUBJECTS
OTHERS
HAVE
PROMPTED
DIVISION
WITHIN
THE
CITIES
THEY
HAVE
SUBJUGATED
SOME
HAVE
NURTURED
ANIMOSITIES
AGAINST
THEMSELVES
OTHERS
HAVE
SOUGHT
TO
WIN
THE
APPROVAL
OF
THOSE
THEY
INITIALLY
DISTRUSTED
SOME
HAVE
ERECTED
FORTRESSES
OTHERS
HAVE
DESTROYED
THEM
NOW
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
SET
DOWN
DEFINITE
JUDGEMENTS
ON
ALL
OF
THESE
MEASURES
WITHOUT
CONSIDERING
THE
PARTICULAR
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF
THE
STATES
WHERE
THEY
MAY
BE
EMPLOYED
I
SHALL
NEVERTHELESS
DISCUSS
THEM
IN
SUCH
BROAD
TERMS
AS
THE
SUBJECT
ITSELF
WILL
ALLOW
TO
BEGIN
WITH
THERE
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
A
CASE
OF
A
NEW
PRINCE
DISARMING
HIS
SUBJECTS
INDEED
WHENEVER
HE
FOUND
THEM
DISARMED
HE
PROCEEDED
TO
ARM
THEM
FOR
BY
ARMING
YOUR
SUBJECTS
YOU
MAKE
THEIR
ARMS
YOUR
OWN
THOSE
AMONG
THEM
WHO
ARE
SUSPICIOUS
BECOME
LOYAL
WHILE
THOSE
WHO
ARE
ALREADY
LOYAL
REMAIN
SO
AND
FROM
SUBJECTS
THEY
ARE
TRANSFORMED
INTO
PARTISANS
THOUGH
YOU
CANNOT
ARM
THEM
ALL
NONETHELESS
YOU
INCREASE
YOUR
SAFETY
AMONG
THOSE
YOU
LEAVE
UNARMED
BY
EXTENDING
PRIVILEGES
TO
THOSE
YOU
ARM
YOUR
DIFFERENT
TREATMENT
OF
THE
TWO
CATEGORIES
WILL
MAKE
THE
LATTER
FEEL
OBLIGATED
TO
YOU
WHILE
THE
FORMER
WILL
CONSIDER
IT
PROPER
THOAT
THOSE
WHO
ASSUME
ADDED
DUTIES
AND
DANGERS
SHOULD
RECEIVE
ADVANTAGES
WHEN
YOU
DISARM
YOUR
SUBJECTS
HOWEVER
YOU
OFFEND
THEM
BY
SHOWING
THAT
EITHER
FROM
COWARDLINESS
OR
FROM
LACK
OF
FAITH
YOU
DISTRUST
THEM
AND
EITHER
CONCLUSION
WILL
INDUCE
THEM
TO
HATE
YOU
MOREOVER
SINCE
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
YOU
TO
REMAIN
UNARMED
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
RESORT
TO
MERCENARIES
WHOSE
LIMITATIONS
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
DISCUSSED
EVEN
IF
SUCH
TROOPS
WERE
GOOD
HOWEVER
THEY
COULD
NEVER
BE
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
DEFEND
YOU
FROM
POWERFUL
ENEMIES
AND
DOUBTFUL
SUBJECTS
THEREFORE
AS
I
HAVE
SAID
A
NEW
PRINCE
IN
A
NEWLY
ACQUIRED
STATE
HAS
ALWAYS
TAKEN
MEASURES
TO
ARM
HIS
SUBJECTS
AND
HISTORY
IS
FULL
OF
EXAMPLES
PROVING
THAT
THIS
IS
SO
BUT
WHEN
A
PRINCE
TAKES
POSESSION
OF
A
NEW
STATE
WHICH
HE
ANNEXES
AS
AN
ADDITION
TO
HIS
ORIGINAL
DOMAIN
THEN
HE
MUST
DISARM
ALL
THE
SUBJECTS
OF
THE
NEW
STATE
EXCEPT
THOSE
WHO
HELPED
HIM
TO
ACQUIRE
IT
AND
THESE
AS
TIME
AND
OCCASION
PERMIT
HE
MUST
SEEK
TO
RENDER
SOFT
AND
WEAK
HE
MUST
ARRANGE
MATTERS
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
THE
ARMS
OF
THE
ENTIRE
STATE
WILL
BE
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
SOLDIERS
WHO
ARE
NATIVE
TO
HIS
ORIGINAL
DOMAIN
AND
SINCE
THE
SUBJECT
DEMANDS
IT
I
WILL
NOT
FAIL
TO
REMIND
ANY
PRINCE
WHO
HAS
ACQUIRED
A
NEW
STATE
BY
THE
AID
OF
ITS
INHABITANTS
THAT
HE
SOUNDLY
CONSIDER
WHAT
INDUCED
THEM
TO
ASSIST
HIM
IF
THE
REASON
IS
NOT
NATURAL
AFFECTION
FOR
HIM
BUT
RATHER
DISSATISFACTION
WITH
THE
FORMER
GOVERNMENT
HE
WILL
FIND
IT
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
TO
KEEP
THEM
FRIENDLY
FOR
IT
WILL
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
PLEASE
THEM
IF
HE
WILL
CAREFULLY
THINK
THE
MATTER
THROUGH
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
EXAMPLES
DRAWN
FROM
ANCIENT
AND
MODERN
AFFAIRS
HE
WILL
UNDERSTAND
WHY
IT
IS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
WIN
THE
FAVOR
OF
THOSE
WHO
WERE
HAPPY
WITH
THEIR
FORMER
GOVERNMENT
AND
HENCE
WERE
HIS
ENEMIES
THAN
TO
KEEP
THE
FAVOR
OF
THOSE
WHO
OUT
OF
DISSATISFACTION
WITH
THE
FORMER
RULE
HELPED
HIM
TO
REPLACE
IT
