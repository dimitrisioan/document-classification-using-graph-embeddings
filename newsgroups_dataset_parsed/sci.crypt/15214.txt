WRITES
HOW
CAN
THE
GOVERNMENT
TELL
WHICH
ENCRYPTION
METHOD
ONE
IS
USING
WITHOUT
BEING
ABLE
TO
DECODE
THE
TRAFFIC
IE
IN
ORDER
TO
ACCUSE
ME
OF
USING
AN
UNAUTHORIZED
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
TECHNIQUE
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
TAKE
BOTH
KEYS
OUT
OF
ESCROW
RUN
THEM
AGAINST
MY
CIPHERTEXT
AND
DRAW
A
BLANK
I
WAS
THINKING
ABOUT
THIS
ALSO
ITS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THE
SYSTEM
TRANSMITS
IN
CLEAR
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
OF
THE
DEVICE
BEING
USED
THAT
WAY
THEY
CAN
START
A
TAP
GET
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
AND
USE
THE
WARRANT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TAP
TO
GET
THE
KEY
IF
THEY
TAP
SOMEONE
WHOS
APPARENTLY
USING
ENCRYPTION
BUT
DONT
FIND
THAT
PREFIX
THEN
THEYLL
ASSUME
ITS
AN
UNAUTHORIZED
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
MAY
THE
KLOO
GNOMES
BE
GENEROUS
