WOULDNT
A
A

MONITOR
OF
SIMILAR
TYPE
SCROLLING
GIBBERISH
AND
ADJACENT
TO
THE
ONE
BEING
USED
PROVIDE
REASONABLE
RESISTANCE
TO
TEMPEST
ATTACKS
WEVE
GOT
A
TEMPEST
RECEIVER
IN
THE
LAB
HERE
AND
THERES
NO
DIFFICULTY
IN
PICKING
UP
INDIVIDUAL
MONITORS
THEIR
ENGINEERING
TOLERANCES
ARE
SLACK
ENOUGH
THAT
THEY
TEND
TO
RADIATE
ON
DIFFERENT
FREQUENCIES
EVEN
WHERE
THEY
OVERLAP
YOU
CAN
DISCRIMINATE
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
DIFFERENT
LINE
SYNCH
FREQUENCIES
YOU
CAN
LOCK

AVERAGE
THE
OTHERS
OUT
THE

ARE
WEIRD
IN
ANY

WITH
VARYING
POLARISATIONS
AND
ALL

OF
INTERACTIONS
WITH
THE

JUST
MOVING
A
FOLDED
DIPOLE
AROUND
IS
ALSO
HIGHLY
EFFECTIVE
AS
A
RANDOMISED
MEANS
OF
SWITCHING
FROM

TO
ANOTHER
HELL
JUST
SET
UP
A

OR
BUILD
AN

FARRADY
CAGE
AROUND
THE

WITH
A
NOISE
SIGNAL
PIPED
INTO
IT
WHILE
THESE
MEASURES
WILL
NOT
TOTALLY
MASK
THE
EMISSIONS
OF
YOUR
EQUIPMENT
THEY
WILL
PROVIDE
SUFFICIENT
INTERFERENCE
TO
MAKE
REMOTE
MONITORING
A
CHANCY
PROPOSITION
AT
BEST
THERE
IS
OF
COURSE
THE
CONSIDERATION
THAT
THESE
MEASURES
MAY
AND
ALMOST
CRETAINLY
WILL
CAUSE
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
INTERFERENCE
IN
YOUR
OWN
SYSTEMS
ITS
A
MATTER
OF
BALANCING
SECURITY
VERSUS
CONVENIENCE
