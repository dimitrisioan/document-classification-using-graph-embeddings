some
of
the
messages
here
seem
to
reflect
the
view
that
the
government
is
listening
in
on
everything
and
one
will
have
to
hide
ones
clipper
messages
somehow
if
nonescrowed
crypto
goes
away
a
little
perspective
might
be
in
order
right
people
here
believe
the
government
is
listening
in
on
everything
sure
if
you
cant
provide
an
answer
change
the
assumptions
to
something
you
can
deal
with
its
not
a
matter
of
the
government
listening
on
on
everything
its
a
matter
of
the
government
listening
on
anyone
they
take
an
interest
in
say
if
you
do
something
heinous
like
attend
a
computer
meeting
at
a
mall
the
secret
service
decides
to
go
for
a
warrantless
search
and
acquires
your
name
its
a
matter
of
any
number
of
possible
wiretap
abuses
that
cryptology
makes
far
less
likely
and
this
chip
can
sabotage
par
for
the
course
though
i
predicted
that
youd
be
jumping
in
in
favor
of
this
the
reply
was
that
youd
justify
anything
up
to
and
including
death
camps
as
long
as
the
government
backed
them
and
had
a
written
policy
statement
perhaps
a
little
extreme
but
not
much
seattle
is
an
indian
word
meaning
degrees
and
raining
