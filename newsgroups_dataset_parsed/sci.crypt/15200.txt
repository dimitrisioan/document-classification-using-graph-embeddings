CARL
APRIL
INITIAL
EFF
ANALYSIS
OF
CLINTON
PRIVACY
AND
SECURITY
PROPOSAL
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
TODAY
MADE
A
MAJOR
ANNOUNCEMENT
ON
CRYPTOGRAPHY
POLICY
WHICH
WILL
EFFECT
THE
PRIVACY
AND
SECURITY
OF
MILLIONS
OF
AMERICANS
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
PLAN
IS
TO
BEGIN
A
COMPREHENSIVE
INQUIRY
INTO
MAJOR
COMMUNICATIONS
PRIVACY
ISSUES
SUCH
AS
EXPORT
CONTROLS
WHICH
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
DENIED
MOST
PEOPLE
EASY
ACCESS
TO
ROBUST
ENCRYPTION
AS
WELL
AS
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
ISSUES
POSED
BY
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
HOWEVER
EFF
IS
VERY
CONCERNED
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
ALREADY
REACHED
A
CONCLUSION
ON
ONE
CRITICAL
PART
OF
THE
INQUIRY
BEFORE
ANY
PUBLIC
COMMENT
OR
DISCUSSION
HAS
BEEN
ALLOWED
APPARENTLY
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
GOING
TO
USE
ITS
LEVERAGE
TO
GET
ALL
TELEPHONE
EQUIPMENT
VENDORS
TO
ADOPT
A
VOICE
ENCRYPTION
STANDARD
DEVELOPED
BY
THE
NATIONAL
SECURITY
AGENCY
THE
SOCALLED
CLIPPER
CHIP
IS
AN
SPLIT
KEY
ESCROWED
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
WHICH
WILL
BE
BUILT
INTO
CHIPS
MANUFACTURED
BY
A
MILITARY
CONTRACTOR
TWO
SEPARATE
ESCROW
AGENTS
WOULD
STORE
USERS
KEYS
AND
BE
REQUIRED
TO
TURN
THEM
OVER
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
UPON
PRESENTATION
OF
A
VALID
WARRANT
THE
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
USED
IS
TO
BE
CLASSIFIED
BUT
THEY
CHIPS
WILL
BE
AVAILABLE
TO
ANY
MANUFACTURER
FOR
INCORPORATION
INTO
THEIR
COMMUNICATIONS
PRODUCTS
THIS
PROPOSAL
RAISES
A
NUMBER
OF
SERIOUS
CONCERNS
FIRST
THE
ADMINISTRATION
APPEARS
TO
BE
ADOPTING
A
SOLUTION
BEFORE
CONDUCTING
AN
INQUIRY
THE
NSADEVELOPED
CLIPPER
CHIP
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
MOST
SECURE
PRODUCT
OTHER
VENDORS
OR
DEVELOPERS
MAY
HAVE
BETTER
SCHEMES
FURTHERMORE
WE
SHOULD
NOT
RELY
ON
THE
GOVERNMENT
AS
THE
SOLE
SOURCE
FOR
CLIPPER
OR
ANY
OTHER
CHIPS
RATHER
INDEPENDENT
CHIP
MANUFACTURERS
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PRODUCE
CHIPSETS
BASED
ON
OPEN
STANDARDS
SECOND
AN
ALGORITHM
CAN
NOT
BE
TRUSTED
UNLESS
IT
CAN
BE
TESTED
YET
THE
ADMINISTRATION
PROPOSES
TO
KEEP
THE
CHIP
ALGORITHM
CLASSIFIED
EFF
BELIEVES
THAT
ANY
STANDARD
ADOPTED
OUGHT
TO
BE
PUBLIC
AND
OPEN
THE
PUBLIC
WILL
ONLY
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
STANDARD
THAT
IS
OPEN
TO
INDEPENDENT
EXPERT
SCRUTINY
THIRD
WHILE
THE
USE
OF
THE
SPLITKEY
DUALESCROWED
SYSTEM
MAY
PROVE
TO
BE
A
REASONABLE
BALANCE
BETWEEN
PRIVACY
AND
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
NEEDS
THE
DETAILS
OF
THIS
SCHEME
MUST
BE
EXPLORED
PUBLICLY
BEFORE
IT
IS
ADOPTED
WHAT
WILL
GIVE
PEOPLE
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
SAFETY
OF
THEIR
KEYS
DOES
DISCLOSURE
OF
KEYS
TO
A
THIRD
PARTY
WAIVE
INDIVIDUALS
FIFTH
AMENDMENT
RIGHTS
IN
SUBSEQUENT
CRIMINAL
INQUIRIES
IN
SUM
THE
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
SHOWN
GREAT
SENSITIVITY
TO
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
THESE
ISSUES
BY
PLANNING
A
COMPREHENSIVE
INQUIRY
INTO
DIGITAL
PRIVACY
AND
SECURITY
HOWEVER
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
SOLUTION
OUGHT
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
PART
OF
THE
INQUIRY
NOT
BE
ADOPTED
BEFORE
THE
DISCUSSION
EVEN
BEGINS
DETAILS
OF
THE
PROPOSAL
ESCROW
THE
KEY
WILL
BE
DIVIDED
BETWEEN
TWO
ESCROW
AGENTS
EACH
OF
WHOM
HOLD
BITS
OF
EACH
KEY
UPON
PRESENTATION
OF
A
VALID
WARRANT
THE
TWO
ESCROW
AGENTS
WOULD
HAVE
TO
TURN
THE
KEY
PARTS
OVER
TO
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENTS
MOST
LIKELY
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
WILL
BE
ASKED
TO
IDENTIFY
APPROPRIATE
ESCROW
AGENTS
SOME
IN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
HAVE
SUGGESTED
ONE
NONLAW
ENFORCEMENT
FEDERAL
AGENCY
PERHAPS
THE
FEDERAL
RESERVE
AND
ONE
NONGOVERNMENTAL
ORGANIZATION
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
AGREEMENT
ON
THE
IDENTITY
OF
THE
AGENTS
YET
KEY
REGISTRATION
WOULD
BE
DONE
BY
THE
MANUFACTURER
OF
THE
COMMUNICATIONS
DEVICE
A
KEY
IS
TIED
TO
THE
DEVICE
NOT
TO
THE
PERSON
USING
IT
CLASSIFIED
ALGORITHM
AND
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
BACK

THE
ADMINISTRATION
CLAIMS
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
BACK
DOOR
MEANS
BY
WHICH
THE
GOVERNMENT
OR
OTHERS
COULD
BREAK
THE
CODE
WITHOUT
SECURING
KEYS
FROM
THE
ESCROW
AGENTS
AND
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
WILL
BE
TOLD
THERE
ARE
NO
BACK
DOORS
TO
THIS
CLASSIFIED
ALGORITHM
IN
ORDER
TO
PROVE
THIS

ARE
INTERESTED
IN
ARRANGING
FOR
AN

CRYPTO
CRACKER
TEAM
TO
COME
IN
UNDER
A
SECURITY
ARRANGEMENT
AND
EXAMINE
THE
ALGORITHM
FOR
TRAP
DOORS
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
WOULD
THEN
BE
MADE

AS

TO
GET
A

MOVING
AND
TO

THAT
THE

BELIEVES
IN
