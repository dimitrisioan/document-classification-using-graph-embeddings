RE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
ARTICLE
JBSWATSONIBMCOM
WRITES
IS
IT
REALISTIC
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
TRY
TO
KEEP
THE
DETAILS
OF
THE
ENCRYTION
ALGORITHM
SECRET
IF
IT
INTENDS
TO
USE
EVIDENCE
FROM
JAMES
B
SHEARER
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THEY
CAN
USE
THE
EAVESDROPPING
AS
EVIDENCE
AT
ALL
HOWEVER
USING
THE
INFO
THEY
GATHER
WHILE
LISTENING
THEY
CAN
GO
SEARCHING
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
AND
FIND
GOOD
STRONG
EVIDENCE
WHICH
THEY
CAN
USE
IN
COURT
QUESTION
CURRENTLY
IT
IS
EASY
TO
WIRETAP
FROM
THE
TECHNICAL
POINT
OF
VIEW
AT
LEAST
ANYBODY
USING
THE
APPROPRIATE
RADIO
RECEIVER
CAN
LISTEN
TO
COMMUNICATIONS
BETWEEN
A
CARTELEPHONE
AND
THE
GROUND
STATION
THE
POLICE
ALSO
OBVIOUSLY
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
WILL
MAKE
IT
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
FOR
THE
NONAUTHORIZED
PERSON
TO
EAVESDROP
NOTE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
WRITE
IMPOSSIBLE
THE
PRIVACY
WILL
THUS
IMPROVE
FROM
THE
CURRENT
SITUATION
POEPLE
WHO
REALLY
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
HIDE
ALREADY
DO
NOT
USE
THE
PHONE
TO
SPEAK
OF
THESE
THINGS
IF
AN
ILLEGAL
OPERATION
IS
REALLY
WORTH
ONE
CAN
AFFORD
HAVING
CRITICAL
DATA
CARRIED
BY
A
PERSON
RATHER
THAN
SENDING
IT
ELECTRONICALLY
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
WILL
NOT
CHANGE
THIS
THE
PROBLEM
IS
MORE
POLITIC
FOREIGN
COUNTRIES
WILL
NEVER
ACCEPT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IS
THE
ACCESS
TO
THE
ESCROW
CANNOT
BE
DIRECTLY
GRANTED
TO
THEIR
OWN
POLICE
FOLLOWING
THEIR
OWN
LAW
NOT
THE
US
LAW
IE
EACH
COUNTRY
WILL
HAVE
ITS
OWN
ESCROW
HOW
THEN
WILL
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
MONITOR
THE
INTERNATIONAL
TRAFFIC
OR
WILL
ENCRYPTED
INTERNATIONAL
TRAFFIC
BE
POSSIBLE
OR
WILL
THERE
BE
AN
INTERNATIONAL
ESCROW
SOME
KIND
OF
UN
THING
FORBIDDING
CRYPTED
COMMUNICATION
IS
IMPRACTICAL
HOW
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
SPOT
A
CRYPTED
COMMUNICATION
IN
THE
THOUSANDS
OF
MEGABYTES
OF
DATA
WHICH
CIRCULATE
ON
THE
VARIOUS
EXISTING
NETWORKS
WHAT
ABOUT
PRIVATE
NETWORKS
AND
THIS
WILL
BE
MORE
AND
MORE
IMPOSSIBLE
AS
THE
VOLUME
OF
ELECTRONIC
TRAFFIC
WILL
INCRERASE
IN
THE
NEXT
YEARS
I
THINK
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
CAN
ONLY
BE
AN
INTERESTING
DEVICE
TO
LIMIT
THE
RISK
OF
FOR
INSTANCE
ONES
GIRLFRIENDS
HUSBAND
LISTENING
TO
HIS
WIFES
COMMUNICATIONS
IT
WILL
BRING
NO
MORE
AS
REGARDS
TO
SECURITY
IS
IT
WORTH
I
THINK
SO
IF
ITS
COST
IS
LIMITED
I
THINK
THAT
MANY
PRIVACY
INVASIONS
ARE
DONE
NOT
ONLY
BY
OFFICIAL
SERVICES
BUT
ALSO
BY
PRIVATE
ENTITIES
THE
CLIPPER
CAN
HELP
REDUCING
THESE
PROVIDED
WE
DO
NOT
HOPE
TOO
MUCH
OF
IT
IT
IS
NOT
A
REAL
DANGER
AND
IT
CAN
BE
HELPFUL
