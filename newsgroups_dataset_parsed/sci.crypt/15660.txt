AMANDA
WALKER
WRITES
AGREED
REMEMBER
I
DONT
EVEN
THINK
OF
CLIPPER
AS
ENCRYPTION
IN
ANY
REAL
SENSEIF
I
DID
ID
PROBABLY
BE
A
LOT
MORE
ANNOYED
ABOUT
IT
I
AGREE
WITH
THIS
ASSESSMENT
FURTHERMORE
ITS
PROMOTION
AS
PROVIDING
GREATER
PROTECTION
THAN
BARE
VOICE
IS
QUITE
TRUE
AS
FAR
AS
IT
GOES
HOWEVER
THE
ONLY
WAY
FOR
IT
TO
FULFILL
ITS
STATED
GOAL
OF
LETTING
LE
WIRETAP
TERRORISTS
AND
DRUG
DEALERS
IS
TO
RESTRICT
STRONGER
TECHNIQUES
WIRETAP
TARGETS
PRESENTLY
USE
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
WEAK
ENCRYPTION
OR
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
NO
ENCRYPTION
THE
LATTER
TWO
CLASSES
CAN
BE
TAPPED
WITH
WEAK
ENCRYPTION
IN
EVERY
PHONE
THE
NOENCRYPTION
CLASS
IS
MERGED
INTO
THE
WEAKENCRYPTION
CLASS
WILL
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
CLIPPER
CAUSE
TARGETS
PRESENTLY
ENJOYING
STRONG
PRIVACY
TO
GIVE
UP
ON
IT
THAT
IS
TO
RELY
FOR
PRIVACY
ON
A
SYSTEM
EXPRESSLY
DESIGNED
TO
DENY
IT
TO
PEOPLE
LIKE
THEM
I
DOUBT
IT
THE
MERE
INTRODUCTION
OF
THIS
SCHEME
WILL
GIVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
NOTHING
THE
STATED
GOAL
OF
PREVENTING
THE
DEGRADATION
OF
WIRETAPPING
CAPABILITIES
CAN
BE
FULFILLED
BY
RESTRICTION
OF
DOMESTIC
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AND
ONLY
BY
THIS
RESTRICTION
CLIPPER
APPEARS
TO
BE
NO
MORE
THAN
A
SOP
GIVEN
TO
THE
PUBLIC
TO
MUTE
ANY
COMPLAINTS
WE
WOULD
FIND
THIS
A
GROSSLY
INADEQUATE
TRADEOFF
BUT
I
FEAR
THE
PUBLIC
AT
LARGE
WILL
NOT
CARE
I
HATE
TO
EVEN
MENTION
GUN
CONTROL
BUT
MOST
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
THINK
THAT
AN
ASSAULT
WEAPON
AS
THE
NYT
USES
THE
WORD
IS
SOME
SORT
OF
AUTOMATIC
WEAPON
CALIBER
MAYBE
WHO
WANTS
TO
HAVE
SUCH
A
THING
LEGAL
WELL
PEOPLE
KNOW
EVEN
LESS
ABOUT
CRYPTOLOGY
I
SUSPECT
THAT
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
COULD
EASILY
BE
LABELED
TOO
MUCH
SECRECY
FOR
LAWABIDING
CITIZENS
TO
NEED
THATS
NOT
FOR
CLINTON
OR
ANYONE
UNDER
HIM
TO
SAY
THOUGH
ONLY
THE
FEDERAL
AND
SUPREME
COURTS
CAN
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
CONSTITUTIONALITY
ANYTHING
THE
ADMINISTRATION
OR
ANY
GOVERNMENTAL
AGENCY
SAYS
IS
OPINION
AT
BEST
WHAT
THEY
SAY
IS
OPINION
BUT
WHAT
THEY
DO
IS
WHAT
MATTERS
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
UNLESS
OVERTURNED
AND
THE
COURTS
ARE
RELUCTANT
TO
ANNUL
LAW
OR
REGULATION
GOING
TO
SOME
LENGTH
TO
DECIDE
CASES
ON
OTHER
GROUNDS
FURTHERMORE
CONGRESS
CAN
GET
AWAY
WITH
QUITE
A
BIT
THEY
COULD
LEVY
A
BURDENSOME
TAX
THIS
WOULD
PLACE
ENFORCEMENT
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
BATF
WHO
AS
WEVE
SEEN
YOU
REALLY
DONT
WANT
ON
YOUR
CASE
THEY
COULD
INVOKE
THE
COMMERCE
CLAUSE
THIS
SEEMS
MOST
LIKELY
THIS
CLAUSE
WILL
GET
YOU
ANYWHERE
THESE
DAYS
THE
WAS
REQUIRED
BECAUSE
THE
SUPREME
COURT
RULED
A
PROHIBITORY
STATUTE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
IN
CONGRESS
PROHIBITED
MANY
DRUGS
WITH
A
TEXTUAL
NOD
TO
THE
COMMERCE
CLAUSE
THE
CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES
ACT
OF
STILL
STANDS
I
THINK
THE
GOVERNMENT
COULD
GET
AWAY

IT
