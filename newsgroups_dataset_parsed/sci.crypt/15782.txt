TELEPHONES
BUT
WERE
TALKING
INEXPENSIVE
TELEPHONES
HERE
INCLUDING
HANDSIZED
CELLULARS
THAT
NEED
STRONG
CRYPTO
REAL
PRIVACY
SO
START
A
COMPANY
AND
BUILD
THEM
THIS
IS
STILL
MOSTLY
A
CAPITALIST
ECONOMY
QUALCOMM
HAD
SPARE
CYCLES
IN
THE

FOR
THEIR
NEW
CDMA
DIGITAL
CELLULAR
PHONES
THEY
WANTED
TO
PUT
STRONG
CRYPTO
INTO
THEM
SINCE
THEY
HAD
THE
CAPACITY
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECIDED
TO
DISCOURAGE
THEM
REALLY
NONE
OF
THIS
STUFF
IS

HARD
ALL
YOU

A

IS

A

IS

JUST
LIKE

DID
I
SUSPECT
THAT
COMPANIES
LIKE

ARE
TOLERATED
BECAUSE
THEIR

ARE
TOO
EXPENSIVE
HOWEVER
NO

STOPS
