DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WRITES
THOUGH
SOME
MAY
ARGUE
ABOUT
THE
NOSE
OF
THE
CAMEL
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROPOSAL
IS
LIMITED
TO
SCRAMBLED
TELEPHONY
IF
IT
IS
ONLY
USED
FOR
THAT
PURPOSE
AND
DOES
NOT
EXTEND
TO
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
OR
FILE
ENCRYPTION
THEN
IT
IS
AN
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THE
CURRENT
MASSPRODUCED
STANDARD
CIVILIAN
TECHNOLOGY
WHICH
WITH
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONS
IS
LIMITED
TO
EASYTOBREAK
INVERTERS
NOTE
THAT
THE
BIG
ISSUE
FOR
THE
FEDS
IS
THE
CONTINUED
ABILITY
TO
WIRETAP
BEFORE
WE
GO
OFF
THE
DEEP
END
WITH
LONG
DISCUSIONS
ABOUT
SECURE
CRYPTO
FOR
EMAIL
AND
FILES
LETS
FOCUS
ON
THIS
ONE
QUESTION
THAT
WAS
NOT
ASKED
IN
THE
RELEASE
IS
WHETHER
THIS
PROPOSAL
IS
LIMITED
TO
TELEPHONY
OR
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
INTENDS
TO
EXPAND
IT
THOUGH
I
SHARE
MANY
OF
THE
CONCERNS
EXPRESSED
BY
SOME
I
FIND
THE
PROPOSAL
LESS
THREATENING
THAN
MANY
OTHERS
SINCE
RIGHT
NOW
MOST
AMERICANS
HAVE
NO
SECURE
TELEPHONY
AND
ANY
JERK
WITH
A
PAIR
OF
CLIP
LEADS
AND
A
GOAT
CAN
EAVESDROP
THIS
WOULD
ALSO
PLUG
UP
THE
SECURITY
HOLE
IN
CELLULAR
AND
CORDLESS
PHONES
READING
BETWEEN
THE
LINES
I
INFER
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
IS
HIGHLY
SECURE
WITHOUT
ACCESS
TO
THE
KEYS
THIS
WOULD
MEET
THE
NEEDS
OF
US
BUSINESSES
CONFRONTED
BY
RICH
AND
POWERFUL
ADVERSARIES
INCLUDING
FRENCH
AND
JAPANESE
SECURITY
SERVICES
AND
RICH
JAPANESE
COMPANIES
IT
ALLOWS
THE
NSA
TO
MAKE
AVAILABLE
SOME
OF
ITS
BETTER
STUFF
WHILE
PROTECTING
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
NEEDS
MOST
LEGITIMATE
US
CORPORATIONS
TRUST
THE
NSA
AND
WOULD
BE
DELIGHTED
TO
HAVE
A
HIGHSECURITY
SYSTEM
CERTIFIED
BY
THEM
EVEN
AT
THE
PRICE
OF
DEPOSITING
KEYS
IN
ESCROW
I
SEE
NO
DIFFICULTY
IN
CREATING
A
RELIABLE
ESCROW
CORPORATIONS
ENTRUST
THEIR
SECRETS
TO
ATTORNEYS
EVERY
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
AND
THAT
SYSTEM
HAS
WORKED
PRETTY
WELL
FROM
MY
POINT
OF
VIEW
THIS
IS
A
FAIR
STARTING
POINT
THERE
ARE
CONCERNS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
INCLUDING
THE
RELIABILITY
OF
THE
ESCROWS
BUT
IN
RETURN
WE
GET
ACCESS
TO
HIGHSECURITY
CRYPTO
MANY
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THAT
DES
AND
OTHER
SYSTEMS
MAY
BE
BREAKABLE
BY
THE
NSA
AND
HENCE
OTHERS
SIMILARLY
SKILLED
AND
ENDOWED
THERE
IS
AT
LEAST
A
GOOD
POSSIBILITY
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
CHECKED
THAT
THE
PROPOSED
SYSTEM
IS
NOT
SO
BREAKABLE
IT
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
BE
NOR
DOES
IT
HAVE
TO
HAVE
TRAPDOORS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
CAN
GET
THE
KEYS
PURSUANT
TO
A
LEGITIMATE
COURT
ORDER
THUS
THEY
CAN
PROTECT
LEGITIMATE
COMMUNICATIONS
AGAINST
ECONOMIC
ADVERSARIES
WHILE
STILL
BEING
ABLE
TO
EAVESDROP
ON
CROOKS
PURSUANT
TO
A
COURT
ORDER
LET
ME
ASK
YOU
THIS
WOULD
YOU
TRUST
RICHARD
NIXON
WITH
YOUR
CRYPTO
KEYS
I
WOULDNT
