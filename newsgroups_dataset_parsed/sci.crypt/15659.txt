clinton
said
in
particular
his
administration
will
place
strict
controls
on
data
formats
and
protocols
and
require
the
registration
of
socalled
cryptographic
keys
in
the
hope
of
denying
drug
dealers
the
ability
to
communicate
in
secret
clinton
said
the
approach
could
be
used
for
crackdowns
on
other
forms
of
underground
economic
activity
such
as
the
deficitcausing
tax
evaders
who
live
in
luxury
at
the
expense
of
our
grandchildren
and
some
people
thought
that
i
am
exaggerating
when
claiming
that
the
cripple
chip
is
just
a
first
step
in
a
totalitarian
plot
against
the
civil
liberties
in
the
usa
it
seems
that
ive
even
been
an
optimist
the
things
are
happening
even
faster
than
i
expected
thats
another
of
the
dirty
tricks
they
used
to
apply
on
us
under
the
communist
regime
do
something
secret
then
tell
the
people
about
is
after
the
fact
when
nothing
can
be
done
any
more
and
of
course
explaining
them
how
much
better
the
situation
is
now
in
my
previous
messages
i
wrote
that
the
americans
should
wake
up
and
fight
against
the
new
proposal
now
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
already
too
late
it
has
already
happened
the
civil
liberties
have
been
violated
no
stollen
from
the
american
people
while
the
most
part
of
this
people
has
been
sleeping
happily
too
sad
im
definitely
going
to
write
my
congressman
and
nobodys
ever
going
to
make
me
respect
a
law
that
violates
my
freedom
of
speech
and
if
the
feds
try
to
enforce
this
law
on
me
i
will
protect
my
freedoms
with
force
if
it
ever
comes
to
that
hopefully
it
wont
doug
holland

anyone
who
tries
to
take
away
my
freedom
hollandcscolostateedu
