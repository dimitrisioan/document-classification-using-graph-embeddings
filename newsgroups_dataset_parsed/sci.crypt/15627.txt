RE
THE
SECRET
SOURCE
OF
THAT
ANNOUNCEMENT
I
GUESS
THE
CRYPTOWRANGLERS
READ
THIS
GROUP
TOO
BUT
OF
COURSE
I
KNEW
THAT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SO
EASY
TO
DO
THERE
IS
NOT
A
SINGLE
DOUBT
IN
MY
MIND
THAT
EVERY
BYTE
THAT
PASSES
EVERY
SIGNIFICANT
GATEWAY
OR
BONE
IS
CAPTURED
FOR
THE
COLLIGATION
OF
DATA
ABOUT
MAYBE
YOUR
NAME
IS
HERE
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
START
A
NEWSGROUP
FOR
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
ENCRYPTED
POSTS
INTENDED
OF
MEMBERS
OF
AFFINITY
GROUPS
WITH
A
SHARED
PRIVATE
KEY
FOR
EXAMPLE
AT
THE
COMING
UP
CYPHERPUNKS
MEETING
A
PRIVATE
KEY
CORRESPONDING
TO
THAT
PARTICULAR
MEETING
COULD
BE
PASSED
OUT
BY
A
MODERATOR
MINUTES
FOLLOWUP
COMMENTS
TO
OTHER
PARTICIPANTS
AND
SO
ON
COULD
BE
POSTED
TO
THE
ALTENCRYPTED
GROUP
FOR
THE
USE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ATTENDED
COMMUNIQUES
INTENDED
BY
THE
GROUP
FOR
NONATTENDEES
COULD
OF
COURSE
JUST
BE
SIGNED
USING
THE
PRIVATE
KEY
BUT
OTHERWISES
NOT
ENCRYPTED
STARTING
A
ALTENCRYPTED
NEWSGROUP
RATHER
THAN
JUST
MAINTAINING
MAILING
LISTS
IS
BETTER
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
FIRST
IT
WOULD
BE
EASIER
TO
ARCHIVE
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
MIGHT
JOIN
A
GROUP
LATE
AND
WHO
MIGHT
LIKE
TO
EASILY
READ
EARLIER
POSTS
SECOND
TRAFFIC
ANALYSIS
TO
KNOW
EXACTLY
TO
WHOM
AN
AFFINITY
MESSAGE
IS
DIRECTED
WOULD
BE
FOILED
THREE
A
NEWSGROUP
IS
MUCH
MORE
PUBLIC
AND
WOULD
SERVE
TO
PUBLICIZE
AVAILABLE
PRIVACY
MEASURES
ON
THE
INTERNET
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
FUN
TO
ACCUMULATE
A
SECRET
KEYRING
FULL
OF
SUCH
KEYS
IT
BEATS
GIVING
OUT
TSHIRTS
AS
A
DOOR
PRIZE
WE
COULD
SEND
A
COPY
OF
ALTENCRYPTED
DIRECTLY
TO
JUDGE
WILLIAM
SESSIONS
OR
ADMIRAL
STUDEMAN
TO
SAVE
THEM
THE
TIME
OF
HAVING
IT
COLLECTED
