I
AM
AWARE
OF
THE
RESTRICTIONS
IMPOSED
BY
THE
MUNITIONS
ACT
ON
THE
EXPORT
OF
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
TECHNOLOGY
HOWEVER
IS
IT
ILLEGAL
TO
TRANSMIT
ENCRYPTED
DATA
FROM
THE
US
TO
ANOTHER
COUNTRY
IF
SO
THEN
WHICH
LAWS
APPLY
TO
THIS
SITUATION
FROM
THE
US
LAW
PERSPECTIVE
UNLESS
YOURE
ENGAGING
IN
ILLEGAL
SPEECH
ITS
NOT
ILLEGAL
TO
USE
ENCRYPTION
YET
THE
NSA
IS
ALLOWED
TO
TRY
TO
LISTEN
BUT
YOURE
NOT
OBLIGATED
TO
MAKE
IT
EASY
FOR
THEM
YET
THE
OTHER
COUNTRY
MAY
HAVE
MORE
REPRESSIVE
LAWS
ABOUT
THAT
I
GATHER
FRANCES
BUREAUCRACY
WANTS
TO
KNOW
WHAT
YOURE
SAYING
AND
IN
THE
OLD
SOVIET
UNION
THEY
DIDNT
NEED
LAWS
TO
MAKE
THINGS
ILLEGAL
PARANOIA
FOLLOWS
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
WANT
TO
PLAY
IT
SAFE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
NSA
IS
LISTENING
MAY
AFFECT
YOUR
WILLINGNESS
TO
USE
WIMPY
CRYPTO
TECHNOLOGIES
BUT
IT
MAY
ALSO
AFFECT
YOUR
WILLINGNESS
TO
USE
TECHNOLOGIES
THAT
VIOLATE
RSAS
PATENTS
EG
IF
YOU
USE
PGP
THE
NSA
MAY
TELL
RSA
THAT
YOURE
DOING
SO
AND
IF
THE
SECRET
SERVICE
CATCHES
ON
THEY
MAY
DECIDE
THAT
THE
MERE
FACT
THAT
RSA
HASNT
FILED
A
LAWSUIT
AGAINST
YOU
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
YOU
DONT
DESERVE
TO
HAVE
YOUR

VIOLATION
MUNITIONS
LAW
VIOLATION
ESPIONAGE
MONEY
LAUNDERING
DRUG
