cryptography
bibliography
yesterday
i
read
an
article
from
someone
who
was
requesting
references
for
introductory
texts
on
cryptography
although
i
marked
the
article
to
return
it
appears
to
have
expired
on
this
site
anyway
on
one
of
the
previous
occasions
when
this
subject
arose
i
saved
a
couple
articles
which
made
suggestions
one
of
the
articles
contained
a
quite
impressive
bibliography
if
the
poster
of
the
request
or
anyone
else
would
like
to
email
me
i
would
be
glad
to
send
out
copies
of
these
recommendations
including
the
bibliography
