AND
YES
THIS
HAS
TO
BE
A
PUBLIC
KEY
SYSTEM
OR
IT
WOULD
BE
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
HANDLE
IT
MIGHT
NOT
BE
RSA
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
PKP
DOESNT
GET
PAID
UNTIL
PKP
HAS
THE
PATENT
ON
THE
GENERAL
CONCEPT
OF
PUBLIC
KEY
ENCRYPTION
AS
WELL
AS
THE
PARTICULAR
IMPLEMENTATION
KNOWN
AS
RSA
HMM
MY
FIRST
THOUGHT
WAS
THAT
THEYRE
USING
DIFFIEHELLMAN
EXPONENTIAL
SESSION
KEY
EXCHANGE
OR
AN
EQUIVALENT
HOWEVER
THE
DIFFIEHELLMAN
PATENT
LIKE
THE
HELLMANMERKLE
ONE
ON
PUBLIC
KEY
SYSTEMS
CLAIMS
ALL
EQUIVALENTS
SO
THE
BASIC
POINT
STANDS
INTERESTINGLY
A
QUOTE
FROM
JIM
BIDZOS
SHOWED
UP
IN
THE

REAL
SOON
AFTER
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
AND
HE
SOUNDED
VERY
PISSED
MAYBE
HE
HADNT
YET
REALIZED
THAT
PKP
MIGHT
HAVE
JUST
STRUCK
GOLD
ALL
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
GET
SOMEONE
TO
ADMIT
THE
GENERAL
SCHEME
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
