how
large
are

what
are
the
typical
sizes
for
keys
for
commercial
secret
key
algorithms
i
know
des
is
bits
tripple
des
is
bits
and
idea
is
bits
is
there
anything
made
in
the
us
that
has
bit
keys
anything
anywhere
that
has
larger
keys
ive
heard
that
can
be
scaled
to
arbitrarily
large
keys
but
is
this
actually
implemented
anywhere
my
mdc
cipher
which
uses
any
oneway
hash
function
as
a
cfbmode
stream
cipher
the
current
implementation
uses
uses
a
key
of
up
to
bits
that
is
you
can
use
a
key
if
you
want
and
copy
it
over
the
entire
range
or
you
can
use
the
entire
bits
runtime
is
independant
of
key
size
the
system
runs
slightly
slower
than
itself
i
presume
and
use
a
similar
system
or
possibly
they
just
hash
an
arbitrarylength
key
down
to
n
bits
maybe
using
something
like
