RE
WHY
THE
CLIPPER
ALGORITHM
IS
SECRET
JOHNLIECCCAMBRIDGEMAUS
JOHN
R
LEVINE
WRITES
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
PROTOCOL
THOUGH
IS
ANOTHER
MATTER
I
SEE
NO
VALID
REASONS
FOR
KEEPING
IT
SECRET
AND
AS
I
HOPE
IVE
SHOWN
ABOVE
THERE
IT
JUST
OCCURRED
TO
ME
WHY
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
SECRET
IF
IT
WERE
PUBLISHED
ONE
COULD
THEN
BUILD
PHYSICALLY
IDENTICAL
CLONE
VERSIONS
I
RECALL
SEEING
A
POST
SOME
TIME
AGO
SAYING
THAT
IF
THE
DETAILS
OF
AN
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
COULDNT
BE
REVEALED
THEN
THE
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
IS
WORTHLESS
I
BELIEVE
THE
STATEMENT
WAS
IN
RESPONSE
TO
SOMEBODY
SAYING
THAT
THEY
HAD
SOME
NEW
SNAZZY
SCHEME
BUT
THE
ALGORITHM
WAS
A
SECRET
DOES
THIS
ALGORITHM
DEPEND
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
SCHEME
IS
SECRET
OR
IS
IT
FOR
THE
STATED
REASONS
ABOVE
