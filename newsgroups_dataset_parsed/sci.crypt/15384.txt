re
why
the
clipper
algorithm
is
secret

writes
the
cryptographic
protocol
though
is
another
matter
i
see
no
valid
reasons
for
keeping
it
secret
and
as
i
hope
ive
shown
above
there
it
just
occurred
to
me
why
the
algorithm
is
secret
if
it
were
published
one
could
then
build
physically
identical
clone
versions
i
recall
seeing
a
post
some
time
ago
saying
that
if
the
details
of
an
encryption
scheme
couldnt
be
revealed
then
the
encryption
scheme
is
worthless
i
believe
the
statement
was
in
response
to
somebody
saying
that
they
had
some
new
snazzy
scheme
but
the
algorithm
was
a
secret
does
this
algorithm
depend
on
the
fact
that
the
scheme
is
secret
or
is
it
for
the
stated
reasons
above
