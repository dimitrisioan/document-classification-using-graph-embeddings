disinformation
sheet
fascinating
most
of
the
content
of
the
white
house
announcements
was
in
what
was
not
said
it
gives
us
almost
nothing
of
value
threatens
to
take
away
a
lot
and
does
it
with
a
sincere
smile
on
its
face
and
the
nice
friendly
word
management
fact
sheet
public
encryption
management
the
first
thing
it
doesnt
say
is
were
giving
you
stronger
encryption
what
it
says
is
the
u
s
government
has
developed
a
microcircuit
that
not
only
provides
privacy
through
encryption
that
is
substantially
more
robust
than
the
current
government
standard
but
also
permits
escrowing
of
the
keys
needed
to
unlock
the
encryption
the
system
for
the
escrowing
of
keys
will
allow
the
government
to
gain
access
to
encrypted
information
only
with
appropriate
legal
authorization
but
des
is
strong
enough
that
only
the
government
can
break
it
now
so
the
major
effect
is
to
make
it
easier
for
government
to
break
at
best
it
makes
it
more
difficult
for
the
nsa
to
break
since
they
need
to
get
one
of
the
two
escrowed
keys
to
do
a
bruteforce
search
for
the
other
key
similarly
it
didnt
say
were
making
encryption
is
commercially
available
because
encryption
is
already
commercially
available
including
forms
the
nsa
may
not
be
able
to
break
like
tripledes
or
idea
and
phone
companies
could
offer
desbased
systems
now
if
they
were
convinced
the
government
would
let
them
and
they
could
make
enough
money
the
next
thing
it
didnt
say
is
were
making
encryption
legal
because
of
course
encryption
has
always
been
legal
and
the
president
cant
change
the
first
amendment
merely
by
decree
what
it
did
say
was
in
making
this
decision
i
do
not
intend
to
prevent
the
private
sector
from
developing
or
the
government
from
approving
other
microcircuits
or
algorithms
that
are
equally
effective
in
assuring
both
privacy
and
a
secure
key
escrow
system
which
clearly
means
were
making
encryption
illegal
unless
we
get
your
keys
soon
once
business
buys
into
this
another
thing
it
didnt
say
is
were
going
to
ask
congress
for
money
to
do
lots
more
wiretapping
because
of
course
theres
a
budget
crisis
and
congress
might
debate
the
policy
issues
or
not
give
them
the
cash
what
it
did
say
was
the
attorney
general
will
procure
and
utilize
encryption
devices
to
the
extent
needed
to
preserve
the
governments
ability
to
conduct
lawful
electronic
surveillance
and
to
fulfill
the
need
for
secure
law
enforcement
communications
further
the
attorney
general
shall
utilize
funds
from
the
department
of
justice
asset
forfeiture
super
surplus
fund
to
effect
this
purchase
which
means
weve
got
money
congress
cant
control
and
were
going
to
buy
lots
of
wiretapping
equipment
with
it
to
detect
nonapproved
crypto
thats
what
preserve
the
governments
ability
to
conduct
surveillance
means
pray
for
peace
