WE
HAD
A
SENIOR

SCIENTIST
IN
CAMBRIDGE
AT
ONE
OF
OUR
WORKSHOPS
RECENTLY
IN
FACT
HE
WAS
HERE
WHEN
THE
CLIPPER
ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS
MADE
BUT
WE
DIDNT
LEARN
OF
IT
TILL
AFTER
HED
GONE
HE
SAID
ON
THIS
POINT
THAT
HE
WAS
FORBIDDEN
BY
LAW
TO
MONITOR
CONVERSATIONS
BETWEEN
US
NATIONALS
AND
HE
IS
A
CHAP
WHO
IS
VERY
PRECISE
ABOUT
HIS
CHOICE
OF

SO
I
DONT
EXPECT
HED
HAVE
ANY
QUALMS
ABOUT
