YOUR

WROTE
THE
PROPOSAL
COULD
BE
MODIFIED
SO
THAT
IF
THEY
GET
A
COURT
ORDER
TO
TAP
YOU
AND
DONT
CHARGE
YOU
WITH
A
CRIME
WITHIN
SAY
DAYS
THEY
HAVE
TO
BUY
YOU
A
NEW
PHONE
IF
THEY
DO
CHARGE
YOU
AND
YOU
ARE
FOUND
INNOCENT
THEY
HAVE
TO
BUY
YOU
A
NEW
PHONE
YES
BUT
WILL
THEY
BUY
YOU
A
TICKET
ON
A
TIME
MACHINE
TO
ALLOW
YOU
TO
GO
BACK
AND
USE
THE
PHONE
WITH
THE
NEW
KEY
INSTEAD
OF
THE
PHONE
WHOSE
KEY
THEY
OBTAINED
IT
IS
UNCLEAR
WHETHER
OBTAINING
THE
KEY
AT
TIME
ALSO
UNLOCKS
MESSAGES
RECORDED
BY
WHOMEVER
AT
EARLIER
TIMES
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
WAS
SILENT
ON
THIS
THE
BETTING
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
ONCE
YOUR
KEY
HAS
BEEN
OBTAINED
BY
THE
AUTHORITIES
BY
DIVORCE
LAWYERS
BY
THE
MAFIA
BY
THE
FBI
BY
LOST
OR
STOLEN
BACKUP
TAPES
BY
THE
NSA
ETC
ALL
PREVIOUS
CONVERSATIONS
ARE
UNSECURE
SESSION
KEYS
ARE
NEGOTIATED
BUT
KNOWING
THE
PRIVATE
KEY
IS
BELIEVED
BY
MANY
COMMENTATORS
HERE
TO
BREAK
THE
SECURITY
NO
DOUBT
MORE
DETAILS
WILL
EMERGE
SO
THE
LOSS
OF
A
KEY
WHETHER
ONE
IS
GUILTY
OR
INNOCENT
MAY
MEAN
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
MERELY
REPLACING
THE
PHONE
SORT
OF
LIKE
SAYING
TO
SOMEONE
OH
I
COPIED
YOUR
DIARY
BUT
ILL
BUY
YOU
A
NEW
ONE
AND
THE
SYSTEM
IF
MADE
MANDATORY
AS
I
EXPECT
WILL
MAKE
SUCH
STORING
OF
CONVERSATIONS
MUCH
EASIER
I
FEAR
FOR
ONE
THING
THE
TRANSMISSION
OF
THE
ESCROW
KEY
FIELD
ACTS
AS
A
CLEAR
SIGNAL
TO
ANYONE
LISTENING
A
KIND
OF
CALLER
ID
AND
CALLEE
ID
ON
A
GRAND
SCALE
ALSO
THE
PHONE
COMPANIES
MAY
NOT
CARE
AS
MUCH
ABOUT
PROTECTING
THE
PRIVACY
OF
THE
CALLS
AS
THEY
PERCEIVE
THEM
ALL
TO
BE
USELESS
ENCRYPTED
JUNK
THIS
IS
A
BIT
OF
A
REACH
I
KNOW
SUGGESTING
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
WILL
MAKE
SECURITY
MORE

STILL
