BILL
STEWART
WRITES
IT
IS
STILL
EASY
TO
CONCEAL
SUPERENCRYPTION
AT
LEAST
UNTIL
THE
INQUISITORS
GET
AHOLD
OF
THE
K
KEY
WHICH
CAN
TAKE
A
WHILE
PRESUMABLY
NOT
IN
NEARREALTIME
WORSTCASE
IN
WHICH
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
PROVIDE
THE
U
KEY
TO
THE
LOCAL
COPS
STILL
ONLY
GETS
ONE
SIDE
OF
THE
CONVERSATION
PER

UNLESS
THE

IS
USED
FOR
BOTH
DIRECTIONS
WHICH
I
SUPPOSE
THE
CAPSTONE

PROBABLY

DESCRIPTION
OF
THE

OPERATION
THAT
THE

KEY
IS
USED
IN

FOR
ENCRYPTING
THE

BUT
THAT
EACH
CHIP
USES
ITS
OWN

FOR
ENCRYPTING
THE

KEY
INTO
THE
LAWENFORCEMENT

SO
YOU
ONLY
NEED
TO
KNOW
THE

FOR

OF
THE

INVOLVED
TO
DECRYPT
THE
MESSAGES
IN
BOTH
