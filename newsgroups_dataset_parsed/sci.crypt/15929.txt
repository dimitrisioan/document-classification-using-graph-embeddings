RE
CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
IN
ARTICLE
JOHN
KELSEY
WRITES
THE
CLIPPER
CHIPS
USER
KEY
IS
FORMED
BY
WHY
IS
THE
TRIPLEENCRYTION
USED
IS
IT
JUST
TO
GAIN
AN
EFFECTIVE
INCREASE
IN
KEYSPACE
TO
DEFEAT
A
POTENTIAL
KEYSEARCH
IF
SO
WHY
USE
BIT
KEYS
NOT
KNOWING
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
SKIPJACK
ALGORITHM
ITS
NOT
REALLY
POSSIBLE
TO
GUESS
WHETHER
THIS
MAKES
IT
HARDER
OR
EASIER
TO
GUESS
WHY
ARE
AND
FORMED
AS
THEY
ARE
IT
WOULD
BE
FACINATING
TO
SEE
THE
SKIPJACK
ALGORITHM
TO
LOOK
FOR
WAYS
OF
ATTACKING
IT
THAT
REQUIRE
THREE
CIPHERTEXT
BLOCKS
FORMED
IN
THAT
ODD
WAY
WHERE
DO
THE
CONSTANT
VALUES
THAT
ARE
CONCATENATED
WITH
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
TO
FORM
COME
FROM
ARE
THEY
CHANGED
FROM
CHIP
TO
CHIP
OR
SESSION
TO
SESSION
EVEN
IF
THEYRE
PUBLISHED
IN
THE
NY
TIMES
IF
SKIPJACK
IS
RESISTANT
TO
KNOWNPLAINTEXT
ATTACKS
WHEN
USING
TRIPLE
ENCRYPTION
THEN
THERES
NO
BREAK
IN
SECURITY
BUT
WHY
ALLOW
THAT
KIND
OF
WEIRD
FORMAT
IF
THOSE
THREE
VALUES
ARE
TRULYRANDOM
BITS
THEN
MAYBE
ITS
USED
TO
ENSURE
THAT
A
KNOWNPLAINTEXT
ATTACK
ON
SKIPJACK
IF
IT
EXISTS
CANT
BE
EASILY
USED
TO
DERIVE
AND
FOR
A
WHOLE
PRODUCTION
RUN
OF
THESE
CHIPS
I
CANT
ANSWER
ALL
OUR
QUESTIONS
IN
DETAIL
BUT
I
CAN
TAKE
A
STAB
AT
THEM
THE
FORM
THE
OPERATIONS
THAT
COMPUTE
AND
IS
OF
COURSE
THE
FAMOUS
TRIPLE
ENCRYPTION
SUGGESTED
FOR
USE
WITH
DES
ITS
MUCH
STRONGER
THAN
A
SINGLE
ENCRYPTION
AND
HAS
AN
EFFECTIVE
KEY
LENGTH
OF
BITS
FOR
REASONS
THAT
WERE
DISCUSSED
WHEN
DES
WAS
FIRST
STANDARDIZED
A
SIMPLE
DOUBLE
ENCRYPTION
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
THE
SAME
STRENGTH
TRIPLE
ENCRYPTION
HAS
BEEN
USED
BY
IBM
SINCE
MORE
OR
LESS
THE
BEGINNING
TO
ENCRYPT
OTHER
KEYS
ITS
RECOMMENDED
FOR
ANYTHING
OF
VERY
HIGH
VALUE
AND
I
THINK
WE
CAN
AGREE
THAT
THE
RI
AND
SI
FIT
THAT
DESCRIPTION
WHY
AND
WELL
YOU
NEED
DIFFERENT
PLAINTEXT
VALUES
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
IF
THEYLL
BE
DISCLOSED
OR
NOT
AT
A
GUESS
THEYRE
CONSTRUCTED
SO
THAT
THEY
DIFFER
IN
AS
MANY
BIT
POSITIONS
AS
POSSIBLE
A
GOO
CRYPTOSYSTEM
WILL
SCRAMBLE
THINGS
A
LOT
WITH
EVEN
A
CHANGE
BUT
THE
VALUES
OF
N
IN
A
SERIES
WILL
HAVE
FAIRLY
SIMILAR
BIT
PATTERNS
AND
THERE
MIGHT
CONCEIVABLY
BE
A
WEAKNESS
SO
THE
NI
VALUES
ARE
AND
IM
GUESSING
CHOSEN
TO
INCREASE
THE
HAMMING
DISTANCE
IN
ANY
EVENT
IM
QUITE
CONVINCED
THAT
ONE
CANNOT
GO
BACK
TO
THE
SI
FROM
THE
UI
LET
ALONE
U
OBSERVE
IF
THE
NSA
HAS
U
THEY
DONT
NEED
TO
FIND
SI
BUT
EVEN
IF
THEY
DO
THEY
CANT
GET
AND
IN
THEORY
THEY
SHOULD
NEVER
EVEN
SEE
THOSE
VALUES
EVEN
WITH
A
WARRANT
THE
REAL
QUESTION
I
THINK
IS
WHY
USE
THIS
SCHEME
AT
ALL
AS
OPPOSED
TO
A
HARDWARE
RANDOM
NUMBER
GENERATOR
MY
ANSWER
IS
THAT
THIS
IS
MUCH
MORE
VERIFIABLE
LOOK
SUPPOSE
THAT
NSA
NIST
THE
ACLU
THE
EFF
AND
THE
NRA
COMBINED
TO
BUILD
A
REALLY
GOOD
RANDOM
NUMBER
GENERATOR
AND
THAT
IT
PASSED
EVERY
TEST
YOU
COULD
THINK
OF
WHEN
YOU
COME
BACK
NEXT
WEEK
TO
PROGRAM
SOME
MORE
CHIPS
DOES
IT
STILL
WORK
THAT
WELL
HAVE
ANY
COMPONENTS
CHANGED
IN
VALUE
HAVE
THE
COMPONENTS
BEEN
CHANGED
OUT
FROM
UNDER
YOU
DOES
IT
STILL
WORK
WELL
THE
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
FOCUSED
MICROWAVE
BEAM
THAT
TENDS
TO
BIAS
IT
TOWARDS
SELECTING
BITS
YES
YOU
CAN
RUN
DETAILED
STATISTICAL
TESTS
ON
IT
AGAIN
BUT
THATS
HARD
CONSIDER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
A
SOFTWARE
SOLUTION
YOU
BRING
YOUR
OWN
FLOPPIES
WITH
YOU
YOU
CAN
RUN
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
CHECKSUMS
ETC
ITS
A
LOT
EASIER
TO
VERIFY
THAT
THE
SOFTWARE
IS
UNCHANGED
IN
OTHER
WORDS
YES
I
CAN
THINK
OF
WAYS
TO
CHEAT
SOFTWARE
TOO
I
THINK
THAT
THEYRE
A
LOT
HARDER
THERE
ARE
THREE
ISSUES
WITH
CLIPPER
THE
FIRST
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
ARCHITECTURE
OF
THE
WHOLE
SCHEME
IS
CAPABLE
OF
WORKING
MY
ANSWER
WITH
ONE
SIGNIFICANT
EXCEPTION
IS
YES
I
REALLY
DO
THINK
THAT
NSA
AND
NIST
HAVE
DESIGNED
THIS
SCHEME
ABOUT
AS
WELL
AS
CAN
BE
ASSUMING
THAT
THEIR
REAL
OBJECTIVES
ARE
AS
STATED
TO
PERMIT
WIRETAPPING
UNDER
CERTAIN
CAREFULLYCONTROLLED
CIRCUMSTANCES
WITH
A
MINIMUM
RISK
OF
ABUSE
THE
EXCEPTION
IS
THAT
U
EXISTS
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
CHIP
ON
A
PROGRAMMING
DISKETTE
THATS
SERIOUSLY
WRONG
AND
SHOULD
BE
LOADED
ONTO
THE
CHIP
SEPARATELY
TO
THOSE
WHO
DISAGREE
AND
I
DONT
CLAIM
MY
ANSWER
IS
OBVIOUS
THOUGH
I
FOUND
MY
OWN
REASONING
SUFFICIENTLY
PERSUASIVE
THAT
I
WAS
FORCED
TO
REWRITE
THE
CONCLUSIONS
SECTION
OF
MY
TECHNICAL
ANALYSIS
PAPER
I
HAD
ORIGINALLY
BLASTED
THE
SCHEME
I
ISSUE
THIS
INVITATION
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
WERE
CHARGED
WITH
IMPLEMENTING
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
WITH
COMPLETE
REGARD
FOR
CIVIL
RIGHTS
AND
DUE
PROCESS
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
DIFFERENTLY
IN
ANSWERING
THIS
QUESTION
PLEASE
ACCEPT
NSAS
FUNDAMENTAL
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT
BOTH
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AGAINST
OUTSIDERS
AND
THE
ABILITY
TO
WIRETAP
SOME
DOMESTIC
USERS
IS
NECESSARY
IF
YOU
FEEL
IT
NECESSARY
TO
CHALLENGE
THOSE
ASSUMPTIONS
DO
IT
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
LAST
ISSUE
I
PRESENT
BELOW
RIGHT
HERE
IM
DISCUSSING
JUST
THE
TECHNICAL
ASPECTS
AND
NO
I
DONT
BY
ANY
MEANS
CLAIM
THAT
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
CAN
BE
DONE
IT
SHOULD
BE
THE
SECOND
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THIS
WHOLE
ARCHITECTURE
IS
ACTUALLY
GOING
TO
BE
USED
JUST
BECAUSE
CLIPPER
CHIPS
ARE
MADE
THIS
WAY
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
THATS
THE
ONLY
WAY
THEYLL
BE
MADE
MAYBE
THE
NSA
WILL
SUBSTITUTE
ITS
OWN
CHIPS
BETWEEN
THE
PROGRAMMING
FACILITY
AND
THE
SHIPPING
DOCK
AND
THEYLL
GENERATE
BOGUS
WARRANT
REQUESTS
SO
THAT
THE
ESCROW
AGENTS
DONT
WONDER
WHY
THEYVE
NEVER
CALLED
SORRY
GUYS
ALL
THEM
TERRORISTS
AND
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
PEDOPHILES
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BOUGHT
TRIPLEDES
PHONES
INSTEAD
WHOD
A
THUNK
IT
I
HAVE
NO
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
AND
AT
THE
MOMENT
I
DONT
SEE
A
WAY
OF
ANSWERING
IT
THOSE
CONCERNS
ARE
PART
OF
MY
REASONING
IN
MY
ANSWER
TO
THE
FINAL
QUESTION
BELOW
THE
THIRD
AND
MOST
SERIOUS
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
CLIPPER
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
EVEN
IF
CARRIED
OUT
STRICTLY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LETTER
OF
THE
LAW
I
THINK
THAT
THE
ANSWER
IS
NO
BUT
ITS
NOT
A
NOBRAINER
IM
A
CIVIL
LIBERTARIAN
NOT
A
LIBERTARIAN
FOR
REASONS
THAT
I
EXPLAINED
AT
GREAT
LENGTH
ON
THE
NET
IN
THE
ELDER
DAYS
AND
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
ENERGY
TO
REPEAT
NOW
BUT
THAT
MEANS
THAT
IM
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THAT
SOME
LAWS
ARE
NECESSARY
SO
LONG
AS
THEY
RESPECT
THE
ESSENTIAL
RIGHTS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
THE
GOVERNMENT
ALREADY
HAS
THE
ABILITY
AND
IN
OUR
SYSTEM
THE
RIGHT
TO
ISSUE
SEARCH
WARRANTS
AND
WHILE
THAT
POWER
HAS
CERTAINLY
BEEN
ABUSED
ITS
ALSO
BEEN
USED
QUITE
PROPERLY
AND
FAIRLY
IN
OTHER
CASES
IS
KEY
ESCROW
SUFFICIENTLY
DIFFERENT
I
THINK
SO
BUT
AGAIN
ITS
NOT
AN
EASY
QUESTION
FOR
ME
IT
IS
EASY
FOR
LIBERTARIANS
TO
ANSWER
OF
COURSE
SINCE
CLIPPER
IS
COMPLETELY
ALIEN
TO
MUCH
OF
THE
REST
OF
THEIR
OFTADMIRABLE
PHILOSOPHY
AND
ITS
ALSO
EASY
FOR
THOSE
WHO
GIVE
THEIR
UNRESERVED
TRUST
TO
GOVERNMENT
A
GROUP
IM
MUCH
MORE
DISTANT
FROM
STEVE
BELLOVIN
