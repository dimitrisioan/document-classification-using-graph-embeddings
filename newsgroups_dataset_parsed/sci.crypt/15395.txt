BRAD
TEMPLETON
WRITES
LETS
ASSUME
FOR
THE
MOMENT
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
REALLY
IS
SECURE
UNLESS
YOU
GET
BOTH
HALVES
OF
THE
ENCRYPTION
KEY
FROM
THE
TWO
INDEPENDENT
ESCROW
HOUSES
LETS
SAY
YOU
EVEN
TRUST
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
ONE
IS
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
THE
EFF
AND
IM
NOT
ENTIRELY
JOKING
ABOUT
THOSE
TWO
NAMES
IN
THAT
CASE
THE
PRINCE
OF
WALES
HAS
NOTHING
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
ON
THIS
SYSTEM
I
MUST
RESPECTFULLY
DISAGREE
WITH
THIS
ASSERTION
BRAD
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
NOTORIOUSLY
SLOPPY
WITH
PHYSICAL
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
INFORMATION
SECURITY
THEY
CANT
KEEP
THEIR
COMPUTERS
SAFE
AND
THEYRE
TRYING
READ
DEA
IS
NOT
ADEQUATELY
PROTECTING
NATIONAL
SECURITY
INFORMATION
GAOIMTEC
FOR
AN
EXCELLENT
EXAMPLE
OF
WHAT
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
PRIVATE
SECTOR
ORGANIZATIONS
TEND
TO
BE
EVEN
MORE
LAX
IN
THEIR
SECURITY
MEASURES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ESCROW
ORGANIZATIONS
WILL
BE
PENETRATED
BY
FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES
WITHIN
MONTHS
IF
NOT
WEEKS
OF
THEIR
SELECTION
PRIVATE
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
LACK
THE
RESOURCES
OF
A
FULLFLEGED
INTELLIGENCE
SERVICE
WILL
TAKE
LONGER
PERHAPS
ON
THE
ORDER
OF
ONE
TO
TWO
YEARS
NONETHELESS
THE
PENETRATIONS
WILL
TAKE
PLACE
WITHOUT
QUESTION
