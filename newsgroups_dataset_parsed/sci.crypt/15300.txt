BRAD
TEMPLETON
WRITES
YOUR
HONOUR
THE
SUSPECT
SUDDENLY
STARTED
USING
ANOTHER
LEVEL
OF
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AND
WE
CANT
TAP
HIS
PHONE
CALLS
ANY
MORE
HE
MUST
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
HIDE
PLEASE
SIGN
THE
WARRANT
TO
SEARCH
HIS
HOUSE
WHAT
THEY
WOULD
NEED
TO
DO
THOUGH
IS
MAKE
SURE
THAT
NOBODY
HAS
ACCESS
TO
DECENT
CRYPTO
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THEY
PROBABLY
CANT
TELL
CLIPPERED
VOICE
FROM
CLIPPERED
TRIPLEDESED
VOICE
UNTIL
THEY
GET
THEIR
COPY
OF
YOUR
KEY
ANY
CRIMINAL
WHOS
GOING
TO
USE
ENCRYPTION
WILL
DO
IT
UNDER
COVER
OF
CLIPPER
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
AVOID
THIS
WILL
BE
TO
TRY
TO
PROHIBIT
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
I
PROBABLY
SHOULDNT
SAY
THIS
BUT
THEY
COULD
TRY
TO
DETECT
THE
USE
OF
AN
ILLEGAL
CYPHER
BY
TRANSMITTING
IN
THE
CLEAR
SOME
STATISTICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
PLAINTEXT
AN
OLDFASHIONED
WIRETAP
COULD
THEN
DETECT
THE
USE
OF
PREENCRYPTION
WHICH
WOULD
DRASTICALLY
INCREASE
THE
MEASURED
ENTROPY
OF
THE
INPUT
A
COUNTERMEASURE
TO
THIS
WOULD
BE
TO
USE
STEGANOGRAPHIC
TECHNIQUES
WHICH
PUT
OUT
VOICE
YOU
CAN
TELL
IF
THE
NSA
BUILT
THIS
FEATURE
IN
BLOW
ON
THE
MIKE
AND
OBSERVE
WHETHER
A
BAND
OF
THUGS
COMES
THROUGH
YOUR
CEILING
