the
point
here
is
not
the
specific
instance
of
the
wiretap
chip
rather
it
is
like
having
the
government
telling
you
that
they
want
a
copy
of
your
house
key
safedeposit
box
keys
etc
and
telling
you
that
they
wont
use
them
unless
its
totally
neccessary
i
sure
wouldnt
want
that
why
should
encryption
be
any
different
actually
the
govrnment
is
telling
you
that
if
you
want
to
use
their
product
the
manufacturer
actually
better
yet
some
trusted
pair
of
escrow
agencies
has
to
have
the
key
most
of
us
already
are
in
this
situationour
car
makers
have
keys
to
our
cars
or
can
get
them
quickly
from
the
vin
number
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
presented
with
a
court
order
theyd
surrender
copies
to
the
government
chances
are
that
many
locksmiths
have
the
code
numbers
for
house
locks
theyve
installed
and
in
an
emergency
can
cut
keys
thus
theyd
also
provide
such
keys
to
the
government
pursuant
to
a
court
order
the
state
has
no
difficulty
gaining
access
to
your
safe
deposit
box
if
they
have
a
court
order
bad
analogy
this
is
not
to
argue
for
or
against
the
proposal
but
rather
better
distinctions
are
required
in
thinking
about
it
than
house
key
safedeposit
keys
etc
