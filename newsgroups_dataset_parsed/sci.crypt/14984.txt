DISKS
SHOULD
BE

ONE

CERTAIN
TYPES

CAN

DECLASSIFIED
USING
A
DEGAUSSING

THAT
HAS
BEEN

OF

A

IS
MAINTAINED
BY
THE

IF

FOR

A

OR
WINCHESTER

AN
APPROVED
METHOD
OF
DECLASSIFYING
THE

IS
TO
EMPLOY
AN
OVERWRITE
PROCEDURE
WHICH
MUST
OVERWRITE
ALL
ADDRESSABLE

THREE
TIMES
BY

THEN
ITS
COMPLEMENT
EG

ALTERNATIVELY
WHEN

IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO

THE

BY

METHOD
IN
THIS

THERE
ARE

ALTERNATE
PROCEDURES
THAT

DISASSEMBLE

FOR
