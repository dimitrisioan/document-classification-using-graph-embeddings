WHY
DO
WE
HACKERS
CARE
ABOUT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
DO
WE
GIVE
A
SHIT
ABOUT
ANYBODYS
PRIVACY
ACCEPT
OUR
OWN
AND
PERHAPS
NOT
EVEN
OUR
OWN
ARE
WE
SO
SMART
THAT
WE
ALWAYS
KNOW
WHEN
WERE
TALKING
TO
SOMEBODY
WHO
HAS
A
WIRETAP
ON
THEIR
PHONE
I
FIND
THIS
A
VERY
DISTURBING
VIEW
YES
WE
DO
CARE
ABOUT
EVERYONES
PRIVACY
EVEN
IF
THEY
DONT
KNOW
IT
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
THE
GOVT
STARTS
CREATING
LEGISLATION
SUCH
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
AND
SUCH
TECHNOLOGIES
BECOME
THE
ONLY
LEGAL
ENCRYPTION
FORMS
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
THE
CLIPPER
IS
THE
ONLY
TYPE
OF
ENCRYPTION
CHIPS
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
MASSES
SURE
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
YOUR
OWN
METHOD
OF
ENCRYPTION
BUT
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
ANYONE
ELSE
TO
TALK
TO
WHAT
USE
IS
IT
YOU
CANT
ASSUME
THAT
EVERYONE
WILL
BE
AS
OPEN
AS
YOU
APPEAR
TO
BE
ABOUT
ENCRYPTION
THE
POINT
HERE
IS
NOT
THE
SPECIFIC
INSTANCE
OF
THE
WIRETAP
CHIP
RATHER
IT
IS
LIKE
HAVING
THE
GOVERNMENT
TELLING
YOU
THAT
THEY
WANT
A
COPY
OF
YOUR
HOUSE
KEY
SAFEDEPOSIT
BOX
KEYS
ETC
AND
TELLING
YOU
THAT
THEY
WONT
USE
THEM
UNLESS
ITS
TOTALLY
NECCESSARY
I
SURE
WOULDNT
WANT
THAT
