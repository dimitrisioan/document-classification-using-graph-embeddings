doing
wasting
my

doing
policy
papers
on

do
us
a

resign
rather
than
right
this
paper
for

rough
eg
wiretaps
may
be
preferentially
used
on

criminals
resulting
in
an
underestimate
this
comes
to
twenty
cents
a
head
over
the
us
population

would
find
some
rigorous
numbers
on

quite
useful
it
would
make
for
nice
slogans

privacy
is
worth
