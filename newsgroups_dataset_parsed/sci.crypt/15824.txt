if
you
can
get
it
for
a
buck
hand
it
must
be
true
eh
im
pretty
sure
the
nsa
is
supposed
to
among
many
other
things
provide
highquality
cryptosystems
to
a
variety
of
places
i
dont
recall
reading
anywhere
reliable
that
theyre
supposed
to
monitor
my
phonecalls
monitor
usenet
provide
only
cryptosystems
they
can
easily
crack
etc
etc
this
is
not
to
say
that
they
dont
they
might
but
you
dont
know
that
they
do
and
you
have
no
evidence
that
they
do
for
almost
all
values
of
you
it
follows
therefore
that
for
most
values
of
you
your
claims
about
the
nsa
border
on
paranoia
andrew
ok
andrew
ill
provide
some
evidence
a
friend
of
mine
worked
for
an
electronics
manufacturer
on
with
a
westcoast
office
they
routinely
sold
story
deleted
let
me
give
you
another
story
that
actually
happened
to
me
we
sell
communications
boards
that
use
a
they
used
to
be
high
tech
our
agent
in
the
uk
sold
a
system
to
a
company
in
ch
which
packaged
it
in
a
product
for
cz
londonbernprague
i
telexed
the
brits
and
told
them
the
swiss
need
to
pass
export
paperwork
through
the
us
as
at
the
time
you
needed
an
export
lisence
for
these
systems
now
i
knew
the
nsa
was
watching
this
traffic
just
like
they
are
watching
this
traffic
and
what
do
you
know
two
weeks
later
an
agent
of
the
us
government
shows
up
in
my
office
to
remind
me
if
we
or
our
agents
sold
systems
into
the
evil
empire
we
had
better
make
sure
the
export
lisences
were
handled
properly
he
was
part
of
a
five
man
office
in
columbus
ohio
who
did
this
stuff
based
on
sources
he
could
not
reveal
i
assume
most
of
the
time
these
guys
sat
around
the
office
with
their
thumbs
up
their
ass
as
there
isnt
that
much
stuff
coming
out
of
columbus
wow
the
electric
utility
in
prague
sure
is
a
big
worry
for
these
folks
the
point
is
we
have
created
a
giant
bureaucracy
nsa
with
a
budget
bigger
than
the
cias
who
like
all
bureaucracies
fill
their
time
looking
for
things
to
do
the
evil
empire
is
gone
the
nsa
is
not
they
will
do
something
to
fill
their
time
and
justify
their
budgets
i
just
wish
they
too
would
sit
around
with
their
thumbs
up
their
ass
but
that
is
too
much
to
hope
for
they
will
spy
on
us
and
do
things
like
skipjack
and
subvert
people
like
