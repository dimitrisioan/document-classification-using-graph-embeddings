i
set
up
a
bbs
that
uses
publickey
encryption
and
encryption
of
files
on
disk
the
general
setup
is
designed
so
that
when
users
connect
they
send
a
private
key
encrypted
using
the
system
public
key
and
the
users
publicprivate
keypair
is
used
to
wrap
the
onetime
session
keys
used
for
encrypting
the
files
on
disk
the
result
of
this
is
that
even
if
i
reveal
the
system
private
key
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
to
gain
access
to
the
files
stored
on
the
machine
what
is
possible
is
for
someone
to
use
the
revealed
system
private
key
to
entice
users
into
revealing
thier
personal
private
keys
during
the
authentication
sequence
any
answers
or
general
musings
on
the
subject
would
be
appreciated
just
a
question
as
a
provider
of
a
public
bbs
service
arent
you
bound
by
law
to
gurantee
intelligble
access
to
the
data
of
the
users
on
the
bbs
if
police
comes
with
sufficent
authorisation
i
guessed
this
would
be
a
basic
condition
for
such
systems
i
did
run
a
bbs
some
time
ago
but
that
was
in
switzerland
