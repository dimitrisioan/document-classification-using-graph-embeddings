re
clipper
considered
harmful
restated
and
amplified
if
the
crooks
use
an
innocent
persons
clipper
phone
on
the
tapped
line
theres
no
problem
the
feds
dont
care
whose
phone
instrument
is
used
just
that
the
conversation
is
by
the
suspect
on
the
tapped
line
they
get
the
serial
number
get
the
keys
and
they
are
in
business
so
you
admit
that
clipper
opens
the
doors
wide
for
the
following
scenario
feds
we
need
the
keys
to
joe
blows
phone
escrow
agent
joe
blow
you
have
a
warrant
to
tap
his
line
feds
well
no
but
we
have
a
warrant
to
tap
carlos
slimedevil
gonzales
line
and
our
tap
shows
that
mr
gonzales
is
using
mr
blows
phone
escrow
agent
well
ok
