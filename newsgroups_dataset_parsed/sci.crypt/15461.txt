im
not
one
of
the
people
who
distrusts
the
government
at
every
turn
but
taking
someones
word
for
it
that
the
pairs
are
not
kept
around
is
pushing
what
im
willing
to
believe
just
a
little
bit
too
far
even
if
they
somehow
address
this
issue
it
is
unlikely
to
be
the
only
back
door
in
they
might
even
have
a
few
intentionally
visible
to
distract
from
the
ones
that
arent
visible
