SUMMARY
DES
INIT
VECTOR
AS
ADDITIONAL
KEY
AT
THE
RISK
OF
GETTING
LOST
IN
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
DISCUSSION
I
GIVE
A
SUMMARY
ON
MY
RECENT
QUESTION
IN
ARTICLE
PQSCBCNHMINNIEZDVUNIMAINZDE
I
WROTE
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
IN
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
SUGGESTS
THAT
A
KEY
SEARCH
ATTACK
AGAINST
DES
IS
QUITE
FEASIBLE
NOW
BUT
NORMALLY
DES
IS
APPLIED
IN
CBC
OR
CFB
MODE
WHERE
ONE
CHOOSES
A
RANDOM
INIT
VECTOR
OF
BYTES
QUESTIONS
MAKES
IT
SENSE
TO
HANDLE
THE
INIT
VECTOR
AS
AN
ADDITIONAL
KEY
THEN
WE
HAVE
A
BIT
KEY
IF
YES
IS
ANYTHING
KNOWN
ABOUT
THE
SECURITY
OF
THIS
KEY
SCHEME
CAN
WE
BREAK
IT
FASTER
THAN
BY
EXHAUSTIVE
SEARCH
THROUGH
THE
BIT
KEY
SPACE
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
ANSWER
IS
NO
CONCEALING
THE
INITIALISATION
VECTOR
ESSENTIALLY
DOESNT
GIVE
ANY
ADDITIONAL
SECURITY
I
GOT
ANSWERS
FROM
GRADYNETCOMCOM
MARKLOMASCLCAMACUK
SMBRESEARCHATTCOM
THAT
OPENED
MY
EYES
ITS
PRETTY
SIMPLE
SAY
E
IS
ENCRYPTION
AND
D
DECRYPTION
WITH
KEY
K
ON
BLOCKS
LET
BE
THE
INITIALISATION
VECTOR
THE
MESSAGE
BLOCKS
THE
CIPHER
TEXT
BLOCKS
THEN
ENCRYPTION
IN
CIPHER
BLOCK
CHAINING
CBC
MODE
WORKS
BY
THE
FORMULA
CI
EMI
XOR
AND
DECRYPTION
BY
MI
XOR
DCI
SO
IF
THE
ATTACKER
DOESNT
HAVE
THIS
ONLY
AFFECTS
THE
FIRST
MESSAGE
BLOCK
BUT
SHE
CAN
DO
HER
KEY
SEARCH
ATTACK
ON
THE
SITUATION
IN
CIPHER
FEEDBACK
CFB
MODE
IS
A
BIT
MORE
COMPLICATED
BUT
SIMILAR
AND
LEFT
AS
AN
EXERCISE
FOR
THE
READER
FINALLY
THERE
IS
THE
MODIFIED
OUTPUT
FEEDBACK
MODE
OFB
WHERE
DES
OR
WHATEVER
BLOCK
CIPHER
YOU
USE
SIMPLY
ACTS
AS
RANDOM
GENERATOR
BY
SI
WITH
INITIALISATION
VECTOR
SEED
AND
ENCRYPTION
IS
GIVEN
BY
CI
MI
XOR
SI
HERE
THE
USUAL
KNOWN
PLAINTEXT
ATTACK
AGAINST

REDUCES
THE
