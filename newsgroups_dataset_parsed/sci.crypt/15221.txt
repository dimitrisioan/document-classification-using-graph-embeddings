RE
TEXT
OF
WHITE
HOUSE
ANNOUNCEMENT
AND
QAS
ON
CLIPPER
CHIP
ENCRYPTION
THE
STRAGEGY
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
INTERESTING
THE
REAL
FEAR
COMES
FROM
THEM
DOING
MORE
THAN
THIS
THIS
IS
A
VOLUNTARY
PROGRAM
AND
THUS
HARDER
FOR
US
TO
OBJECT
TO
ON
THE
SURFACE
THEIR
STRATEGY
IS
A
BUSINESS
ONE
RATHER
THAN
LEGAL
ONE
THEY
ARE
PUSHING
TO
GET
A
STANDARD
IN
PLACE
A
SECRET
STANDARD
AND
IF
THEY
GET
IT
AS
A
STANDARD
THEN
THEY
WILL
DRIVE
COMPETITORS
OUT
OF
THE
MARKET
IT
WILL
BE
LEGAL
TO
SELL
BETTER
UNTAPABLE
ENCRYPTION
THAT
DOESNT
HAVE
REGISTERED
KEYS
BUT
IT
WILL
BE
DIFFICULT
AND
THUS
NOT
A
PLAN
FOR
MOST
PHONE
COMPANIES
YOU
SEE
WITH
CLIPPER
CHIP
PHONES
YOULL
BE
ABLE
TO
TALK
TO
ANY
CELLULAR
COMPANY
OR
OTHER
PHONES
OR
PORTS
BECAUSE
THEY
WILL
FOLLOW
THE
STANDARD
ATT
HAS
ALREADY
ANNOUNCED
A
CLIPPER
CHIP
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
MARKETED
HARD
TO
GET
MAJOR
VENDORS
TO
USE
THESE
CHIPS
IF
THEY
GET
ENOUGH
MARKET
SHARE
THEY
WILL
RULE
AND
THUS
THERE
WILL
BE
VERY
LITTLE
MARKET
FOR
SYSTEMS
THAT
CANT
BE
TAPPED
BY
THE
POLICE
THE
PUBLIC
ISNT
THAT
CONCERNED
ABOUT
IT
NOW
AFTER
ALL
THEY
FREELY
DO
CALLS
THAT
ANYBODY
WITH
AN
OLD
TV
CAN
LISTEN
TO
TODAY
THEY
WONT
PAY
BIG
EXTRA
BUCKS
FOR
PROPRIETARY
PHONES
THAT
SECURE
THEM
ONLY
FROM
THE
POLICE
WELL
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
BUY
THESE
PHONES
BUT
THEY
WILL
ONLY
WORK
WITH
OTHER
PROPRIETARY
PHONES
SO
THE
MARKET
WILL
BE
SMALL
AND
THE
PHONES
EXPENSIVE
UNLESS
THEY
ARE
MADE
IN
NUMBERS
LARGE
ENOUGH
TO
SELL
THEM
CHEAP
ONLY
THE
MOB
WILL
BUY
THEM
AND
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
FBI
WILL
WANT
TO
TRACK
THE
CUSTOMER
LISTS
OF
BETTER
ENCRYPTION
PHONES
BECAUSE
THE
ONLY
REASON
A
PERSON
WOULD
WANT
ONE
IS
TO
EVADE
THE
POLICE
