WRITES
NOT
TO
PICK
ON
MR

IN
PARTICULAR
OF

BUT
ISNT
THIS
KIND
OF
THE
DOMINO
THEORY
WHEN
ONE
LITTLE
COUNTRY
FALLS
ITS
NEIGHBOR
WILL
SURELY
FOLLOW
AND
BEFORE
YOU
KNOW
IT
WERE
ALL
MINING
SALT
IN
SIBERIA
FOR
NOT
TURNING
IN
OUR

SECRET
DECODER
RINGS
THERE
WAS
AN
INTERESTING
COLUMN
ON
THE
EDITORIAL
PAGE
OF
THE
DALLAS
MORNING
NEWS
ON
SATURDAY
BY
WALTER
WILLIAMS
WHO
I
BELIEVE
IS
A
PROFESSOR
AT
GEORGETOWN
I
WONDER
IF
HE
KNOWS
OF
DOROTHY
YOURE
NOT
IN
KANSAS
ANYMORE
DENNING
THE
ARTICLE
WAS
TITLED
GOVERNMENT
SLOWLY
ERODING
OUR
LIBERTIES
AND
IN
IT
HE
TELLS
A
STORY
ATTRIBUTED
TO
THE
LATE
LEONARD
READ
WHO
EXPLAINED
THAT
IF
YOU
WANTED
TO
TAKE
LIBERTY
AWAY
FROM
AMERICANS
YOU
HAD
TO
KNOW
HOW
TO
COOK
A
FROG
MR
READ
SAID
YOU
CANT
COOK
A
FROG
BY
BOILING
A
POT
OF
WATER
AND
THEN
THROWING
THE
FROG
IN
HIS
REFLEXES
ARE
SO
QUICK
THAT
AS
SOON
AS
HIS
FEET
TOUCH
THE
WATER
HE
WILL
LEAP
AWAY
YOU
MUST
PUT
THE
FROG
IN
A
POT
OF
COLD
WATER
AND
HEAT
IT
UP
BIT
BY
BIT
BY
THE
TIME
THE
FROG
REALIZES
HES
BEING
COOKED
IT
IS
TOO
LATE
IT
IS
THE
SAME
WITH
AMERICANS
IF
ANYONE
TRIED
TO
TAKE
OUR
FREEDOMS
ALL
AT
ONCE
WE
WOULD
NATURALLY
REBEL
AND
SUPPRESS
THE
TYRANT
BUT
AS
WITH
SUCCESSFUL
FROG
COOKING
OUR
LIBERTIES
CAN
BE
TAKEN
A
LITTLE
BIT
AT
A
TIME
THE
LAST
LINE
OF
THE

SAYS
ITS
NOT
TOO

FOR
US

THE
