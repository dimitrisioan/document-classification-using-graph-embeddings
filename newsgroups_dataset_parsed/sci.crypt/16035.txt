WRITES
CLIPPER
ALSO
ALLOWS
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
THE
CRIMINAL
TO
CONCEAL
USE
OF
SUPERENCRYPTION
AN
AUTOMATED
FULLSYSTEM
SURVEILLANCE
MECHANISM
QUITE
FEASIBLE
ACROSS
RADIO
BANDWIDTH
WHICH
KNOWS
FAMILY
KEY
F
CAN
VALIDATE
CLIPPER
WRAPPERS
AND
NESN
ASSOCIATIONS
BUT
IT
CANNOT
REVEAL
IN

THE
USE
OF
SUPERENCRYPTION
UNLESS
IT
KNOWS
ALL
UNIT
KEYS
WHICH
WE
ARE
BEING
ASSURED
ARE
ONLY
TO
BE
MADE

DOESNT
TAKE
A

TO
SEE
IF
THAT
IS
CORRECT
YES
BUT
THE
EXTRA

COULD
BE
APPLIED

WOULD
BE
FINE
THE

BE
IN
THE
LAWENFORCEMENT

THE

WOULDNT
BE
READABLE
EVEN
IF
THE
PARTICULAR
CLIPPERS
KEY
WERE
OBTAINED
FROM
THE
ESCROW
AGENTS
IN

IT
SHOULDNT
EVEN
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
DETECT
THAT
A

HAS
BEEN
DOUBLEENCRYPTED
WITHOUT
A
COURT
ORDER
