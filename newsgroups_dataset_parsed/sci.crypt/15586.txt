QUESTIONS
AND
ANSWERS
ABOUT
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATIONS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
INITIATIVE
Q
SUPPOSE
A
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCY
IS
CONDUCTING
A
WIRETAP
ON
A
DRUG
SMUGGLING
RING
AND
INTERCEPTS
A
CONVERSATION
ENCRYPTED
USING
THE
DEVICE
WHAT
WOULD
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
DECIPHER
THE
MESSAGE
A
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
OBTAIN
LEGAL
AUTHORIZATION
NORMALLY
A
COURT
ORDER
TO
DO
THE
WIRETAP
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THEY
WOULD
THEN
PRESENT
DOCUMENTATION
OF
THIS
AUTHORIZATION
TO
THE
TWO
ENTITIES
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
SAFEGUARDING
THE
KEYS
AND
OBTAIN
THE
KEYS
FOR
THE
DEVICE
BEING
USED
BY
THE
DRUG
SMUGGLERS
THE
KEY
IS
SPLIT
INTO
TWO
PARTS
WHICH
ARE
STORED
SEPARATELY
IN
ORDER
TO
ENSURE
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
KEY
ESCROW
SYSTEM
I
APOLOGIZE
FOR
BEING
SO
DENSE
BUT
THIS
SENTENCE
READS
AS
IF
IT
WAS
LIFTED
FROM
A
LUIS
BUNUEL
SCREENPLAY
AM
I
MISSING
SOMETHING
WHY
ON
EARTH
WOULD
DRUG
SMUGGLERS
EVEN
USE
THE
DEVICE
THEN
OBVIOUSLY
THEYLL
BE
USING
SOMETHING
LIKE
TRIPLE
ENCRYPTION
DES
INSTEAD
AS
LONG
AS
ALTERNATIVES
TO
CLIPPER
REMAIN
LEGAL
CLIPPER
ACCOMPLISHES
ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING
ZERO
AS
FAR
AS
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
IS
CONCERNED
THE
WHOLE
SCHEME
IS
AN
ABSOLUTE
TOTAL
INCREDIBLE
WASTE
OF
GOVERNMENT
TIME
AND
MONEY
AS
LONG
AS
OTHER
ENCRYPTION
SCHEMES
THAT
ARE
ANY
GOOD
REMAIN
LEGAL
IN
ORDER
FOR
CLIPPER
TO
WORK
AS
INTENDED
ALL
STRONG
CRYPTOSYSTEMS
HAVE
TO
BE
OUTLAWED
