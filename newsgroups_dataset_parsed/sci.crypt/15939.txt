JERRY
HAN
WRITES
SOMEBODY
ASKED
ME
WHAT
WAS
WRONG
ABOUT
OVERREACTING
IN
CASES
SUCH
AS
THIS
THAT
WAS
PROBABLY
ME
I
MEANT
ONLY
THAT
NOBODY
HAS
OVERREACTED
YET
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
JERRY
WAS
SUGGESTING
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
CURRENTLY
OVERREACTING
AND
I
VEHEMENTLY
DISAGREE
I
SEE
A
LOT
OF
TALK
BUT
NOT
MUCH
ACTION
I
SEE
NOW
THAT
I
MISUNDERSTOOD
JERRYS
POSITION
THE
REASON
IS
VERY
SIMPLE
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
DIE
IN
A
RIOT
IN
A
NEW
CIVIL
WAR
EVERYBODY
IS
JUMPING
UP
AND
DOWN
AND
SCREAMING
ABOUT
IT
AND
IM
WORRIED
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
REACH
FOR
THEIR
HAMMERS
AND
RIFLES
BEFORE
THEIR
PENS
AND
PAPER
NOT
THIS
BUNCH
THEYLL
JUST
BITCH
ON
THE
NET
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
THEN
GO
BACK
TO
LURKING
CAN
PEOPLE
WORK
WITHIN
THE
SYSTEM
BEFORE
TRYING
TO
BREAK
IT
EXAMINE
YOUR
HISTORY
BOOKS
AND
FIND
OUT
HOW
MANY
ARMED
REVOLUTIONS
LED
TO
DEMOCRATIC
OR
DEMOCRATIC
STYLE
GOVERNMENTS
I
THINK
YOULL
ONLY
FIND
ONE
IN
OVER
FIVE
THOUSAND
YEARS
OF
WRITTEN
HISTORY
ACTUALLY
ITS
NOT
QUITE
THAT
BAD
BUT
ITS
CLOSE
I
THINK
EVERYONE
WOULD
JUST
AS
SOON
WORK
WITHIN
THE
SYSTEM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
USING
THE
BULLET
BOX
INSTEAD
OF
THE
BALLOT
BOX
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
A
DETERRENT
BY
KEEPING
THE
PRICE
OF
MASSIVE
ABUSE
UNACCEPTABLE
HOWEVER
GOVERNMENTS
BEING
WHAT
THEY
ARE
SURE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
REMOVE
THAT
DETERRENCE
WHICH
WILL
MAKE
THE
NEED
FOR
ARMED
CITIZENS
ALL
THE
MORE
GREAT
YOU
DONT
NEED
EM
TILL
YOU
DONT
HAVE
EM
THEN
I
THINK
WE
CAN
BE
MORE
ACCURATELY
CALLED
SUBJECTS
INSTEAD
OF
CITIZENS
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
PEOPLE
BEING
SOVEREIGN
OVER
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
SURE
NOT
IN
VOGUE
IN
THE
BELTWAY
THESE
DAYS
THAT
IS
FOR
SURE
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
SAYING
WE
KNOW
BEST
WE
WILL
TELL
YOU
WHAT
YOU
NEED
OR
DONT
NEED
AFTER
THAT
OLDFASHIONED
ANACHRONISM
CALLED
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
IS
NOT
NEEDED
IN
THESE
ENLIGHTENED
TIMES
LOOK
WE
COLLECTIVELY
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
THROW
THE
BUMS
OUT
BUT
WE
DONT
USE
IT
WE
CLEARLY
DONT
NEED
TO
GO
BURNING
THINGS
DOWN
BUT
WE
NOT
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
ITS
WAY
THERE
ARE
EIGHT
BILLS
BEFORE
CONGRESS
THAT
WILL
EITHER
BAN
TAX
EXHORBITANTLY
OR
REGISTER
ALL
USEFUL
WEAPONS
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
UNCONNECTED
US
SUBJECT
CAN
YOU
SAY
JUST
FOR
A
BOX
OF
CARTRIDGES
FOR
PRACTICE
ONE
OF
THE
CURRENT
ADMINISTRATIONS
TOP
PRIORITY
ITEMS
IS
TO
DISARM
ALL
WHO
ARE
NOT
WELLCONNECTED
OR
THAT
WORK
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
CLEARLY
DO
NEED
TO
THROW
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THE
BUMS
OUT
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
BUMS
HAVE
LEARNED
TO
TARGET
ONLY
SMALL
GROUPS
OF
PEOPLE
AT
A
SINGLE
TIME
SO
THE
MASSES
WONT
REACT
AND
THROW
THEM
OUT
EVENTUALLY
THE
MASSES
WILL
REACT
UNLESS
THE
BUMS
CEASE
THEIR
RELENTLESS
ENCROACHMENT
ON
LIBERTY
AND
DESPOILMENT
OF
THE
ECONOMY
THE
SOONER
IT
HAPPENS
THE
LESS
THE
DAMAGES
WILL
BE
I
DONT
WANT
TO
LIVE
IN
A
WAR
ZONE
EITHER
I
WANT
TO
SEE
THE
BUMS
THROWN
OUT
BEFORE
THEY
DO
SOME
REAL
DAMAGE
ANOTHER
TACTIC
IS
TO
TOSS
OUT
SO
MANY
OUTRAGES
AT
ONCE
THAT
NOBODY
CAN
GIVE
JUSTICE
TO
THEM
