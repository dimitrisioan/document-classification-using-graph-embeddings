MARCUS
J
RANUM
WRITES
WHEN
YOUVE
GOT
HRH
PRINCE
OF
WALES
SAYING
STUPID
THINGS
OVER
CORDLESS
PHONES
ITS
NOT
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
THAT
DRUG
DEALERS
CHILD
PORNOGRAPHERS
COMMIES
LISP
PROGRAMMERS
AND
OTHER
THREATS
TO
THE
CIVILIZED
WORLD
MIGHT
TRANSACT
INCRIMINATING
BUSINESS
OVER
ENCRYPTING
CELLULAR
PHONES
LETS
ASSUME
FOR
THE
MOMENT
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
REALLY
IS
SECURE
UNLESS
YOU
GET
BOTH
HALVES
OF
THE
ENCRYPTION
KEY
FROM
THE
TWO
INDEPENDENT
ESCROW
HOUSES
LETS
SAY
YOU
EVEN
TRUST
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
ONE
IS
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
THE
EFF
AND
IM
NOT
ENTIRELY
JOKING
ABOUT
THOSE
TWO
NAMES
IN
THAT
CASE
THE
PRINCE
OF
WALES
HAS
NOTHING
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
ON
THIS
SYSTEM
INDEED
AS
POINTED
OUT
SINCE
THE
CURRENT
SYSTEMS
EVEN
THE
CURRENT
DIGITAL
SYSTEMS
ARE
VERY
EASY
TO
DECODE
RIGHT
NOW
ANYBODY
WITH
AN
OLD
TV
CAN
HEAR
THEM
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
THIS
WILL
BE
VIEWED
AS
AN
OH
GOODY
STEP
UPWARDS
AND
LOOK
AT
HOW
TOLERANT
THE
PUBLIC
IS
THEYRE
WILLING
TO
LET
THE
NEIGHBOURS
WITH
THE
RADIOS
HEAR
RIGHT
NOW
IT
WAS
SUGGESTED
BY
ONE
PERSON
THAT
A
LOT
OF
NONEVIDENTIARY
WIRETAPPING
IS
GOING
ON
RIGHT
NOW
WITHOUT
WARRANTS
BECAUSE
ANYBODY
CAN
DO
IT
AND
ITS
JUST
AN
ECPA
VIOLATION
THIS
WOULD
STOP
THAT
ALL
TAPPING
WOULD
NEED
A
WARRANT
OR
A
BREACH
OF
SECURITY

THE
ESCROW
