i
say
in
theory
because
in
another
case
a
woman
was
held
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
reveal
the
location
of
her
child
even
after
taking
the
in
this
case
the
woman
was
suspected
of
having
murdered
the
kid
so
taking
the
wasnt
surprising
sure
so
she
was
probably
guilty
but
thats
not
good
enough
in
our
system
youre
not
supposed
to
be
able
to
force
a
suspect
to
confess
to
a
crime
no
matter
how
strongly
you
think
theyre
guilty
you
have
to
develop
your
evidence
independently
doing
otherwise
might
catch
a
few
more
crooks
but
only
at
the
cost
of
turning
the
clock
back
to
the
middle
ages
when
confessions
were
routinely
tortured
out
of
suspects
both
guilty
and
innocent
ok
i
should
have
read
the
thread
before
posting
my
own
i
would
just
add
to
phils
very
infomative
discussion
the
following
caveat
the
fifth
amendment
applies
only
in
crinial
cases
nor
shall
any
person
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
thus
if
the
father
sued
for
custody
of
the
children
the
case
would
be
civil
and
the
defendant
mother
would
not
have
fifth
amendment
protection
oddly
enough
her
refusal
to
give
information
in
a
civil
case
can
lead
to
criminal
contempt
charges
thus
landing
her
in
jail
the
interesting
part
of
all
this
is
that
in
a
murder
trial
the
woman
can
plead
the
fifth
as
to
the
location
of
the
childthis
is
routine
a
computer
crime
prosecution
thus
would
seem
to
be
fertile
ground
for
this
kind
of
defense
where
a
suit
by
a
party
injured
by
hackers
would
not
if
i
am
accused
for
example
of
sending
encrypted
kiddie
porn
over
the
nets
the
fifth
should
protect
my
key
if
i
am
accused
of
sending
copyrighted
material
however
it
proabably
will
not
copyright
infringement
not
being
a
crime
in
the
technical
sense
the
really
tricky
question
is
say
i
do
both
naughty
boy
that
i
am
can
the
government
use
the
information
gained
in
the
civil
trial
ie
my
key
to
gain
access
to
my
files
for
use
in
the
criminal
prosecution
the
answer
should
certainly
be
no
but
lord
only
knows
how
this
would
work
out

i
