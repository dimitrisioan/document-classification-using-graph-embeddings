yes
im
not
sure
if
my
xposting
to
compspeech
made
it
to
here
too
but
ive
found
that
a
low
sample
rate
samplessec
at
bits
per
sample
plus
the
pd
shorten
lossless
sound
compression
code
actually
does
get
speech
into
with
a
simdgen
left
over
this
is
definitely
worth
working
on
folks
and
shorten
works
in
well
under
realtime
i
dont
think
that
this
should
be
worked
on
just
in
the
context
of
cryptography
thats
sure
to
pose
all
sorts
of
problems
for
all
sorts
of
people
whats
needed
is
for
someone
to
develop
a
portable
telephone
quality
converter
imagine
if
you
will
a
little
box
that
takes
data
on
its
serial
port
and
puts
out
sound
and
takes
sound
and
codes
it
to
signals
on
its
serial
port
full
duplex
now
this
device
is
not
a
cryptographic
device
its
a
portable
poor
mans
sound
blaster
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
got
loads
of
perfectly
legitimate
applications
for
a
speech
synthesis
with
a
few
nifty
libraries
and
some
samples
b
speech
recording
for
electronic
messaging
c
building
voicemail
systems
d
internet
talk
radio
e
internet
relay
chat
of
course
some
of
the
electronic
messaging
in
item
b
might
be
encrypted
possibly
realtime
but
thats
the
users
decision
one
would
need
of
these
talky
boxes
and
a
pair
of
modems
and
some
kind
of
cutout
to
switch
over
and
some
code
on
say
a
laptop
id
really
like
to
see
such
a
thing
developed
so
that
interactive
internet
talk
radio
could
be
done
ideally
though
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
device
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
enough
device
that
nobody
should
be
able
to
balk
at
its
widespread
use
obviously
to
make
it
easy
for
homebrewers
it
should
use
pretty
common
hardware
its
interesting
to
note
that
id
already
talked
with
a
couple
of
folks
about
building
such
a
thing
before
this
whole
clipper
thing
started
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
track
down
a
couple
of
folks
who
are
able
to
make
sample
units
given
incentive
and
some
time
id
envisioned
finding
a
couple
of
folks
interested
in
such
a
project
and
helping
fund
development
of
a
public
domain
board
layout
and
parts
set
that
could
be
published
in
the
form
of
cad
drawings
for
a
couple
of
major
cad
packages
and
in
postscript
anyone
interested
ill
start
a
provisional
mailing
list
let
me
know
if
you
want
on
mjr
