re
ideas
on
clipper
i
was
annoyed
to
find
that
this
guy
posted
my
private
email
response
to
him
but
since
i
believe
what
i
said
ill
defend
it
anyway
in
article

theyre
betting
that
you
cant
cryptanalyze
e
to
get
u
given
n
but
we
cant
do
this
right
now
with
des
even
knowing
the
encryption
method
without
doing
almost
the
whole
search
that
is
not
true
with
chosen
plaintext
attacks
des
keys
can
be
determined
without
the
full
search
by
almost
i
mean
the
differential
cryptanalysis
attack
the
chosen
plaintext
attack
requires
a
detailed
analysis
of
about
chosen
plaintexts
drawn
from
a
total
of
about
that
need
to
be
run
if
i
understand
the
situation
correctly
this
is
certainly
a
break
under
the
meaning
of
the
act
but
does
not
constitute
much
less
work
than
the
brute
force
keysearch
the
rest
of
his
article
assumes
that
we
can
figure
out
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
e
by
choosing
the
correct
data
to
send
through
it
and
observe
the
results
i
wish
him
joy
of
it
and
choose
not
to
try
that
attack
i
am
not
defending
the
system
and
in
fact
am
offended
by
the
ideas
of
escrowed
keys
or
a
secret
algorithm
becoming
a
de
facto
industry
standard
however
i
also
object
to
opposing
it
for
the
wrong
reasons
since
that
weakens
the
case
against
it
i
said
in
my
private
email
its
not
clear
that
the
experts
will
be
told
f
in
fact
id
be
surprised
id
expect
something
more
of
the
form
of
the
fips
pub
describing
des
so
that
they
could
look
at
the
algorithm
in
general
rather
than
with
the
specific
set
of
keys
chosen
oh
come
on
thats
like
saying
you
could
evaluate
des
without
the
sbox
constants
no
its
quite
different
the
government
would
have
no
percentage
in
choosing
f
to
be
a
weak
key
since
its
not
to
their
advantage
to
have
anybody
else
know
it
the
experts
could
thus
assume
that
f
is
no
worse
than
anything
else
during
their
analysis
totally
different
situation
from
unknown
sboxes
again
im
not
saying
it
would
be
good
or
satisfactory
for
the
experts
to
just
be
given
the
raw
algorithm
without
the
rest
of
the
surrounding
details
regarding
the
chip
and
protocols
and
so
on
simply
that
i
doubt
that
they
would
be
given
all
the
information
