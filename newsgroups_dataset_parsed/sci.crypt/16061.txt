im
not
a
lawyer
and
i
dont
even
play
one
on
tv
but
intuitively
theres
something
wrong
with
having
ones
words
archived
for
possible
future
use
against
you
this
possibility
frightens
me
more
than
any
of
the
talk
about
the
clipper
chip
right
to
cryptography
etc
i
can
just
imagine
it
the
mother
is
wheeled
into
the
labour
ward
after
delivery
a
government
agent
steps
up
to
read
the
baby
its
rights
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
if
you
give
up
this
right
anything
you
say
may
be
taken
down
and
used
in
evidence
against
you
