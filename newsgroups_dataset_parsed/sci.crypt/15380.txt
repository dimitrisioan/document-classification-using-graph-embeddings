THE
GREATEST
DANGER
OF
THE
ESCROW
DATABASE
IF
IT
WERE
KEPT
ON
DISK
WOULD
BE
THE
CHANCE
THAT
A
COMPLETE
COPY
COULD
SOMEHOW
LEAK
OUT
YOU
OF
COURSE
THEN
ITS
HARD
TO
BACKUP
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
NO
BACKUP
THE
DATA
IS
NOT
THERE
WHEN
A
WARRANT
COMES
ARE
WORSE
THAN
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
A
SECRET
BACKUP
IF
THE
DATA
ISNT
THERE
WHEN
THE
WARRANT
COMES
YOU
EFFECTIVELY

YOU

THIS

ARGUING
NO

THE

ME
HAS
HIS
BRAIN
IN
THE

GEAR
AS
YOU
CAN
INFER
FROM
THE
FIRST
SENTENCE
I
MEANT
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
NO

ARE
BETTER
THAN
THE
