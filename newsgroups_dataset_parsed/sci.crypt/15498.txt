RE
THE
OLD
KEY
REGISTRATION
IDEA
IN
ARTICLE
PCWACCESSDIGEXCOM
PETER
WAYNER
WRITES
THAT
LEADS
ME
TO
CONJECTURE
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
IS
VULNERABLE
TO
SIMPLE
PHONE
SWAPPING
ATTACKS
I
SERIOUSLY
DOUBT
THAT
ANY
PRACTICAL
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
THIS
PROPOSAL
WOULD
PLACE
THE
ONUS
ON
THE
INDIVIDUAL
TO
REGISTER
KEYS
REALISTICALLY
THE
CLIPPERCHIP
WILL
PROBABLY
EMIT
AN
ID
CODE
WHICH
WILL
SERVE
AS
THE
IDENTIFIER
WHEN
REQUESTING
THE
KEY
FRAGMENTS
THE
CHIP
MANUFACTURER
WOULD
REGISTER
THIS
IDENTIFIER
CODE
VS
KEY
COMBINATION
WHEN
THE
CHIP
IS
MADE
AND
THE
UNINITIATED
ENDUSER
CAN
THEREFORE
REMAIN
COMPLETELY
OUTSIDE
THE
LOOP
THE
CHIP
COULD
BE
USED
IN
A
CELLULAR
PHONE
A
MODEM
OR
OTHER
DEVICE
IT
REALLY
MAKES
NO
DIFFERENCE
WHEN
THE
AUTHORITIES
DETECT
THE
USE
OF
THIS
ENCRYPTION
STANDARD
DURING
SURVEILLANCE
THEY
WOULD
THEN
CAPTURE
THE
ID
AND
APPLY
FOR
THE
KEY
IN
ORDER
TO
DECRYPT
THE
DATA
