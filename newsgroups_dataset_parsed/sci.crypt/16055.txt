well
actually
this
ones
easy
its
their
job
the
nsa
is
supposed
to
develop
cryptosystems
if
the
government
chooses
to
go
ahead
and
sell
those
cryptosystems
to
the
masses
so
be
it
ah
but
developing
cryptosystems
which
are
specificially
designed
to
protect
the
governments
domestic
spying
capabilities
takes
them
beyond
that
mandate
into
the
forbidden
field
of
domestic
wiretapping
but
the
nsa
will
not
be
doing
any
wiretapping
the
actual
wiretapping
will
presumably
be
conducted
by
the
fbi
of
course
the
capability
for
this
was
provided
by
the
nsa
but
i
think
that
they
are
still
within
the
limitations
of
their
charter
i
realize
this
is
a
fine
point
and
some
may
differ
but
this
is
my
opinion
although
i
dont
care
for
clipper
and
wont
support
or
use
it
i
dont
see
the
nsa
as
having
overstepped
their
bounds
