NEW
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
EVER
SINCE
CRAIG
ROWLAND
POSTED
HIS
PIECE
NEW
ENCRYPTION
TO
SCICRYPT
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
DISCUSSION
OF
OUR
COMPANY
SECURED
COMMUNICATIONS
TECHNOLOGIES
INC
AND
ON
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
NEA
I
SPOKE
TO
CRAIG
AT
LENGTH
ON
AND
WE
COVERED
A
LOT
OF
GROUND
SOME
OF
THE
INFORMATION
IN
THE
POSTING
REQUIRES
SOME
CLARIFICATION
AND
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ANSWER
SOME
OF
THE
QUESTIONS
RAISED
ON
SCICRYPT
SCT
IS
A
SMALL
COMPANY
BASED
IN
SILVER
SPRING
MARYLAND
OUR
TWO
MAIN
PRODUCTS
AT
THIS
TIME
ARE
A
PC
BASED
SECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
PROGRAM
CALLED
SECOM
AND
A
GENERAL
PURPOSE
ENCRYPTION
CHIP
WHICH
USES
THE
NEA
ALGORITHM
DEVELOPED
FOR
SECOM
SECOM
PROVIDES
AN
ENCRYPTED
SECURE
COMMUNICATION
LINK
BETWEEN
TWO
PCS
CONNECTED
OVER
DIAL
UP
TELEPHONE
LINES
IT
SUPPORTS
SIMULTANEOUS
BIDIRECTIONAL
FILE
TRANSFER
AND
KEYBOARD
TO
SCREEN
CHAT
IT
HAS
ITS
OWN
PROPRIETARY
COMMUNICATIONS
PROTOCOL
WHICH
IS
TIGHTLY
INTEGRATED
TO
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALL
THOUGH
IT
IS
A
PACKETIZED
LINK
THE
DATA
STREAM
APPEARS
TO
BE
CONTINUOUS
BECAUSE
THE
PACKET
BOUNDARIES
ARE
HIDDEN
WHEN
SECOM
WAS
INITIALLY
DEVELOPED
IT
WAS
IMPLEMENTED
TO
USE
DES
ENCRYPTION
A
BUSINESS
DECISION
WAS
MADE
TO
SEEK
EXPORT
APPROVAL
FOR
THE
PRODUCT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
PERCEIVED
THAT
THE
OVERSEAS
MARKET
WAS
A
LARGE
ONE
AND
PROVIDED
A
GOOD
MARKETING
OPPORTUNITY
WE
SOON
FOUND
OUT
THAT
WE
WOULD
NEVER
BE
GRANTED
GENERAL
EXPORT
APPROVAL
FOR
ANYTHING
USING
DES
ALL
THOUGH
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
WAS
NEVER
EXPLICITLY
STATED
IT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
SECRET
GOVERNMENT
TO
GOVERNMENT
AGREEMENTS
WHICH
ARE
STILL
IN
EFFECT
IN
ANY
EVENT
THE
DECISION
WAS
MADE
TO
DEVELOP
A
NEW
AND
DIFFERENT
ALGORITHM
WHICH
WOULD
TAKE
THE
PLACE
OF
DES
THIS
WAS
THE
REASON
NEA
NEW
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
WAS
BORN
AT
THIS
TIME
NEA
IS
BEING
HELD
AS
A
TRADE
SECRET
THE
PRELIMINARY
WORK
OF
PATENTING
IT
HAS
BEGUN
AND
THE
PLAN
IS
TO
MAKE
IT
PUBLIC
ONCE
THE
PATENT
PROCESS
IS
COMPLETE
ALL
THOUGH
ONE
CAN
MAKE
CERTAIN
LEGAL
ARGUMENTS
FOR
KEEPING
IT
AN
ONGOING
SECRET
I
THINK
IN
THE
CASE
OF
AN
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
LET
PEOPLE
SHOOT
AT
IT
OVER
AN
EXTENDED
PERIOD
OF
TIME
TO
PROVE
ITS
WORTH
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
EXPORT
APPROVAL
FOR
SECOMNEA
IT
WAS
NECESSARY
TO
GO
THROUGH
NSA
AND
TO
REVEAL
TO
THEM
THE
DETAILS
OF
THE
PROGRAM
AND
ALGORITHM
THIS
WAS
DONE
ONLY
AFTER
WE
HAD
A
FINISHED
PRODUCT
TO
SUBMIT
LET
ME
STATE
UNEQUIVOCALLY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
BACK
DOOR
TO
THE
PROGRAM
OR
THE
ALGORITHM
SECURED
COMMUNICATIONS

A

FINANCIAL
INTEREST
IN

WAY
WHATSOEVER
WITH

OF

FROM

STANDPOINT
WE
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
SELLING
CHIPS
AND
SOFTWARE
HOPEFULLY
IN
LARGE
QUANTITIES
AND
A
BACK
DOOR
TO
THE
ENCRYPTION
IF
FOUND
OUT
COULD
DESTROY
OUR
CREDIBILITY
AND
OUR
BUSINESS
WITH
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
APPROVED
FOR
EXPORT
WE
SET
OUT
TO
TALK
TO
A
NUMBER
OF
POTENTIAL
CUSTOMERS
FOR
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCTS
AND
SYSTEMS
WE
WERE
ABLE
TO
IDENTIFY
SEVERAL
COMMON
THREADS
OF
FUNCTIONALITY
REQUIREMENTS
THIS
LED
TO
THE
DESIGN
OF
A
CHIP
WITH
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
CAST
IN
SILICON
AND
CERTAIN
OTHER
CAPABILITIES
ADDED
SO
THAT
THE
CHIP
COULD
FULFILL
THE
BROAD
RANGE
OF
REQUIREMENTS
THAT
WE
IDENTIFIED
WE
ARE
STRONGLY
OPPOSED
TO
THE
CLIPPERCAPSTONE
CHIPS
IN
A
PRESS
RELEASE
TODAY
OUR
PRESIDENT
DR
STEPHEN
BRYEN
STATED
IT
SEEMS
AS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
AN
UNLIMITED
SOURCE
OF
FUNDS
TO
USE
TO
PUSH
ITS
NEW
BUGGED
CHIPS
ON
THE
AMERICAN
PUBLIC
BUT
DO
WE
NOT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THE
NATIONAL
SECURITY
AGENCY
WHICH
IS
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
INVOLVED
IN
DOMESTIC
SPYING
CAN
FUND
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
COMMERCIAL
CHIP
INTENDED
TO
ACCOMMODATE
US
GOVERNMENT
DOMESTIC
SPYING
ACTIVITIES
IF
THEY
HAD
ASKED
ME
TO
PUT
A
BACK
DOOR
IN

I
WOULD
HAVE
TOLD
