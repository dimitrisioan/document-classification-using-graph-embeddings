THIS
SUGGESTS
A
NEW
PC
SECURITY
PRODUCT
DESIGN
APPROACH
FIRST
FILL
THE
HARD
DRIVE
WITH
RANDOM
FILES
AND
FILES
ENCRYPTED
UNDER
A
NUMBER
OF
KNOWN
KEYS
THEN
WHENEVER
A
NEW
SECRET
FILE
IS
CREATED
YOU
DELETE
A
RANDOM
FILE
AND
REPLACE
IT
WITH
REAL
ENCRYPTED
DATA
NEW
NONSECRET
FILES
ARE
ENCRYPTED
UNDER
A
KNOWN
KEY
BETTER
YET
INSTEAD
OF
THRASHING
AROUND
ON
THE
DOS
FILE
SYSTEM
TAKE
IT
A
STEP
FURTHER
WRITE
YOURSELF
A
MINIMAL
FILE
SYSTEM
PROGRAM
THAT
IS
USED
TO
CREATEDELETE
FILES
ENDECRYPT
THEM
TO
RAMDISK
LIST
A
DIRECTORY
PUT
THE
UTIL
PASSWORD
PROTECTED
ON
A
FLOPPY
THE
CATCH
IS
THAT
THE
STORAGE
SPACE
USED
BY
THIS
UTIL
IS
NOT
PART
OF
THE
DOS
FILE
SYSTEM
INSTEAD
DEFRAG
YOUR
DISK
THUS
PACKING
ALL
ALLOCATED
CLUSTERS
INTO
CLUSTERS
THEN
USE
THE
BACK
END
OF
THE
PARTITION
TO
HOLD
YOUR
STEALTH
FILE
SYSTEM
OR
LEAVE
A
SMALL
PARTITION
ON
THE
DISK
THAT
IS
NOT
ASSIGNED
TO
DOS
ANOTHER
APPROACH
MIGHT
BE
TO
USE
A
DIRECTORY
THAT
CONTAINS
A
SET
OF
INVARIANT
FILES
DOS
SYSTEM
FILES
FOR
INSTANCE
DUE
TO
DOS
ALLOCATING
A
MINIMUM
STORAGE
UNIT
OF
A
CLUSTER
THERE
IS
UNUSED
PHYSICAL
SPACE
ON
THE
DISK
BETWEEN
THE
TAIL
END
OF
EACH
FILE
AND
THE
END
OF
ITS
ASSOCIATED
CLUSTER
THESE
DEAD
SPACES
COULD
BE
CONCATENATED
AND
USED
TO
HOLD
YOUR
STEALTH
FILE
SYSTEM
NOW
YOU
HAVE
A
SITUATION
WHERE
NO
ENCRYPTED
DATA
APPEARS
ON
YOUR
DISK
AT
ALL
