writes
the
easiest
way
is
a
user
fee
for
each
clipper
chip
manufactured
this
makes
the
funding
separate
from
government
it
also
has
the
neat
side
property
that
if
the
chip
doesnt
catch
on
the
scheme
breaks
down
and
the
government
is
back
to
the
drawing
boards
assuming
that
they
havent
prohibited
alternatives
in
the
meantime
in
fact
maybe
this
should
be
part
of
the
official
system
before
the
government
is
allowed
to
move
this
past
the
experimental
stage
they
should
have
to
demonstrate
economic
viability
by
mass
adoption
david
while
i
disagree
strongly
with
you
on
the
issue
of
our
trusting
the
government
i
think
you
have
a
good
idea
here
there
is
danger
that
with
funding
coming
from
asset
forfeitures
the
government
could
continue
to
promulgate
a
bad
product
in
spite
of
poor
acceptance
making
the
product
pay
its
way
as
it
must
for
private
ventures
would
be
a
good
incentive
for
quality
