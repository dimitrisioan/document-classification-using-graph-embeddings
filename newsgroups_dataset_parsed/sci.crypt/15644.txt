NEW
ENCRYPTION
AS
PROMISED
I
SPOKE
TODAY
WITH
THE
COMPANY
MENTIONED
IN
A
WASHINGTON
TIMES
ARTICLE
ABOUT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
ANNOUNCEMENT
THE
NAME
OF
THE
COMPANY
IS
SECURE
COMMUNICATIIONS
TECHNOLOGY
INFORMATION
WILL
BE
GIVEN
AT
THE
END
OF
THIS
MESSAGE
ON
HOW
TO
CONTACT
THEM
BASICALLY
THEY
ARE
DISTURBED
ABOUT
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
FOR
MANY
REASONS
THAT
WE
ARE
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
HOWEVER
MR
BRYEN
OF
SECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
BROUGHT
TO
LIGHT
MANY
POINTS
THAT
MIGHT
INTEREST
MOST
OF
THE
READERS
HIS
BELIEF
IS
THAT
ATT
WAS
MADE
KNOWN
OF
THE
CLIPPER
WELL
BEFORE
THE
REST
OF
THE
INDUSTRY
THIS
IS
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
SEVERAL
OF
WHICH
ARE
A
COMPANY
OF
ATTS
SIZE
COULD
NEVER
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
A
DECISION
TO
USE
THE
NEW
CHIP
ON
THE
SAME
DAY
IT
WAS
ANNOUNCED
MONTHS
AGO
THEY
PROPOSED
USING
THEIR
OWN
CHIP
FOR
ATTS
SECURE
TELEPHONE
DEVICES
ATT
BASICALLY
BLEW
THEM
OFF
AS
BEING
NOT
INTERESTED
AT
ALL
THIS
STUCK
THEM
AS
STRANGE
UNTIL
NOW
ALSO
I
SPOKE
WITH
ART
MELNICK
THEIR
CRYPTOGRAPHER
HE
EXPRESSED
SEVERAL
CONCERNS
OVER
THE
NEW
CLIPPER
CHIP
THE
OBVIOUS
BACKDOOR
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
LET
MANY
PEOPLE
DECRYPT
THE
CODE
ONCE
THE
KEY
IS
RELEASED
TO
AUTHORITIES
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
CRYPTO
SYSTEM
IS
LOST
FOREVER
THESE
KEYS
CAN
END
UP
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
ANY
AGENCY
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ESCROWED
KEYS
NEVER
CHANGE
MEANS
THAT
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
VULNERABLE
OVER
TIME
TO
AN
ATTACKER
THE
CLASSIFIED
ALGORITHM
MAY
HIDE
ANOTHER
BACKDOOR
BUT
HE
FEELS
THAT
IT
IS
PROBABLY
TO
KEEP
PEOPLE
FROM
FORGING
FAKE
SERIAL
NUMBERS
OR
CHANGING
THE
KEYS
THEMSELVES
ADDITIONALLY
HE
FEELS
THAT
THE
NSA
HAS
PROBABLY
SPENT
ENOUGH
TIME
AND
MONEY
IN
WORKING
ON
A
WAY
TO
KEEP
THIS
CHIP
FROM
BEING
REVERSED
ENGINEERED
THAT
HE
FEELS
THAT
REVERSE
ENGINEERING
IT
WILL
BE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
DO
HE
FEELS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
DEVELOPED
A
SUITABLE
TECHNIQUE
TO
PROTECT
THE
CHIP
FROM
THIS
ATTACK
ALSO
HE
FEELS
THAT
THE
CHIP
IS
HARDWARE
ENCODED
WITH
THE
ALGORITHM
AND
NOT
MICROCODED
ONTO
THE
CHIP
ADDITONALLY
I
SPOKE
WITH
MR
MELNICK
ABOUT
THEIR
ALGORITHM
HE
COULDNT
TELL
ME
MUCH
ABOUT
THEIR
NEW
AGORITHM
BECAUSE
IT
HASNT
BEEN
PATENTED
YET
HOWEVER
HE
TOLD
ME
A
LITTLE
THE
ALGORITHM
WILL
BE
RELEASED
FOR
PUBLIC
REVIEW
AFTER
PATENTS
HAVE
BEEN
GRANTED
FOR
IT
THIS
IS
SO
THE
CRYPTO
COMMUNITY
CAN
SEE
THAT
IT
IS
SECURE
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
CALLED
NEA
FOR
NEW
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
THE
DETAILS
WERE
SKETCHY
BECAUSE
NOW
IT
IS
HELD
AS
A
TRADE
SECRET
UNTIL
THE
PATENT
WAS
ISSUED
BUT
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
WILL
INCORPORATE
THE
FOLLOWING
IT
WILL
HAVE
FAST
ENCRYPTION
OF
DATA
EXACT
SPECS
NOT
GIVEN
BUT
MR
MELNICK
STATED
MUCH
FASTER
THAN
WHAT
AN
CAN
PUT
OUT
IT
IS
A
SYMMETRIC
CIPHER
JUST
LIKE
IDEA
AND
DES
IT
WILL
USE
BIT
DATA
BLOCKS
FOR
ENCRYPTION
LIKE
DES
AND
IDEA
THE
KEY
LENGTH
WAS
NOT
GIVEN
TO
ME
BUT
MR
MELNICK
STATES
THAT
IT
IS
ADUJUSTABLE
AND
IS
MORE
THAN
ADEQUATE
FOR
SECURITY
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
WRITTEN
IN
C
AND
ASSEMBLER
IN
SOFTWARE
FORM
AND
CAN
BE
PORTED
TO
MANY
PLATFORMS
UNLIKE
THE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
WHICH
IS
HARDWARE
ONLY
AND
CANNOT
BE
MADE
INTO
SOFTWARE
THIS
I
CONSIDER
A
DEFINITE
PLUS
FOR
THE
NEA
FOR
WIDESPREAD
USE
THE
ALGORITHM
WILL
ACCOMODATE
PUBLIC
KEY
DISTRIBUTION
TECHNIQUES
SUCH
AS
RSA
OR
DIFFIEHELLMAN
THIS
WILL
ALSO
BE
SUPPORTED
IN
THE
HARDWARE
CHIP
RIGHT
NOW
THE
PROJECTED
COST
OF
THE
NEA
CHIP
WILL
BE
ABOUT
DOLLARS
FOR
EACH
CLIPPER
WILL
RUN
EACH
CHIP
THAT
IS
IF
IT
IS
PRODUCED
ENOUGH
WHICH
PROBABLY
WONT
HAPPEN
THEY
CURRENTLY
SELL
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
CCOM
THAT
USES
THE
ALGORITHM
AND
A
SPECIAL
STREAMING
PROTOCOL
THAT
DOES
NOT
DIVIDE
THE
ENCRYPTED
DATA
INTO
BLOCKS
THIS
COULD
PREVENT
PLAINTEXT
ATTACKS
IF
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
THE
BLOCK
HEADER
IS
THIS
PROGRAM
OPERATES
AT
ALL
SUPPORTED
SPEEDS
AND
USES
THE
SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
MOST
IMPORTANTLY
IT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
BACKDOOR
RIGHT
NOW
THE
COMPANY
IS
AFRAID
THAT
THE
NEW
CLIPPER
CHIP
WILL
PUT
THEM
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
THIS
IS
A
VERY
REAL
POSSIBILITY
SO
THEY
REALLY
NEED
HELP
IN
STOPPING
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
FROM
BECOMING
A
STANDARD

YOU
WANT
TO

THEY
