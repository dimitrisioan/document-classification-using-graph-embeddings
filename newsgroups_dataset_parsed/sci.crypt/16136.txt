re
clipper
not
good
enough
for
government
this
is
stupid
wont
it
cost
more
to
those
companies
hoping
to
serve
the
govt
and
private
markets
if
they
dont
use
the
same
technology
i
would
guess
that
they
wont
use
clipper
at
all
what
they
will
do
is
use
their
stuiiis
amoung
themselves
and
the
governmental
agencies
they
need
to
talk
to
and
ignore
clipper
after
all
if
its
not
secure
enough
for
the
agencydepartment
they
are
communicating
with
why
should
the
coprations
trust
it
