THE

OF
THE
ASSOCIATION

THAT
SOUNDS
LIKE
AN

TO
ME
AFTER
A
BRIEF
TELEPHONE
CALL
TO
PROFESSOR
COPPERUD
IN
WHICH
I
INTRODUCED
MYSELF
BUT
DID
NOT
GIVE
HIM
ANY
INDICATION
OF
WHY
I
WAS
INTERESTED
I
SENT
THE
FOLLOWING
LETTER
I
AM
WRITING
YOU
TO
ASK
YOU
FOR
YOUR
PROFESSIONAL
OPINION
AS
AN
EXPERT
IN
ENGLISH
USAGE
TO
ANALYZE
THE
TEXT
OF
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
TO
THE

AND
EXTRACT
THE
INTENT
FROM
THE

SECOND
AMENDMENT
IS
A
WELLREGULATED
MILITIA
BEING
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
FREE
STATE
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
SHALL
NOT
BE
INFRINGED
THE
DEBATE
OVER
THIS
AMENDMENT
HAS
BEEN
WHETHER
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
SENTENCE
A
WELLREGULATED
MILITIA
BEING
NECESSARY
TO
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
FREE
STATE
IS

OF

THE

OF

I
WOULD
REQUEST
THAT
YOUR
ANALYSIS
OF
THIS
SENTENCE
NOT
TAKE
INTO
CONSIDERATION
ISSUES
OF
POLITICAL
IMPACT
OR
PUBLIC
POLICY
BUT
BE
RESTRICTED
ENTIRELY
TO
A
LINGUISTIC
ANALYSIS
OF
ITS
MEANING
AND
INTENT
FURTHER
SINCE
YOUR
PROFESSIONAL
ANALYSIS
WILL
LIKELY
BECOME
PART
OF
LITIGATION
REGARDING
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
I
ASK
THAT
WHATEVER
ANALYSIS
YOU
MAKE
BE
A
PROFESSIONAL
OPINION
THAT
YOU
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
STAND
BEHIND
WITH
YOUR
REPUTATION

EVEN
BE

IF
NECESSARY

CONCLUDED
I
REALIZE
THAT
I
AM
ASKING
YOU
TO
TAKE
ON
A
MAJOR
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
TASK
WITH
THIS

I
AM
DOING
SO
BECAUSE
AS
A
CITIZEN
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
VITALLY
IMPORTANT
TO
EXTRACT
THE
ACTUAL
MEANING
OF
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
WHILE
I
ASK
THAT
YOUR
ANALYSIS
NOT
BE
AFFECTED
BY
THE
POLITICAL
IMPORTANCE
OF
ITS
RESULTS
I
ASK

YOU
DO
THIS
BECAUSE
OF

IMPORTANCE
AFTER
SEVERAL
MORE

AFFECT

OF

THE

AND
USAGE
OF
THIS

AND
THE
WAY

MODIFY
EACH

IDENTICAL
TO

PROFESSOR
COPPERUD
HAD
ONLY
ONE
ADDITIONAL
COMMENT
WHICH
HE
PLACED
IN
HIS
COVER
LETTER
WITH
WELLKNOWN
HUMAN
CURIOSITY
I
MADE
SOME
SPECULATIVE
EFFORTS
TO
DECIDE
HOW
THE
MATERIAL
MIGHT
BE
USED
BUT
WAS
UNABLE
TO
REACH
ANY
CONCLUSION
SO
NOW
WE
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
BY
ONE
OF
THE
TOP
EXPERTS
ON
AMERICAN
USAGE
WHAT
MANY
KNEW
ALL
ALONG
THE
CONSTITUTION
OF
THE
UNITED

UNCONDITIONALLY
PROTECTS
THE
PEOPLES
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
FORBIDDING
ALL
GOVERNMENTS
FORMED
UNDER
THE

FROM
ABRIDGING
THAT
RIGHT
AS
I
WRITE
THIS
THE
ATTEMPTED
COUP
AGAINST
CONSTITUTIONAL
GOVERNMENT
IN
THE
SOVIET
UNION
HAS
FAILED
APPARENTLY
BECAUSE
THE
WILL
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THAT
PART
OF
THE

TO
BE
FREE
FROM
CAPRICIOUS
TYRANNY
IS
STRONGER
THAN
