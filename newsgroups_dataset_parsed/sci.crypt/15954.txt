maybe
so
but
its
quite
common
there
are
millions
of
macintosh
users
who
have
no

whats
in
apples
patented
roms
many
have
modems
connected
how
do
you
know
all
your
business
secrets
arent
being
stolen
answer
because
you
trust
apple
because
if
any
such
attempt
however
sophicsticated
came
out
it
would
destroy
apples
credibility
forever

neither
or
apply
with
the
government
though
the
feds
unlike
apple
have
repeatedly
demonstrated
that
trust
is
an
unsafe
thread
on
which
to
hang
your
freedom
why
because
unlike
apple
in
the
govt
has
no
credibility
to
lose
im
serious
about
this
one
can
name
just
about
any
agency
the
irs
rtc
fcc
faa
fbi
nsa
cia
and
find
numerous
examples
of
the
public
trust
run
roughshod
over
worse
one
can
rarely
find
in
such
examples
any
serious
consequences
to
the
offending
agency
even
supposing
we
could
get
a
reign
on
trust
somehow
theres
always
the
matter
of
competence
in
govt
agencies
can
they
even
trust
themselves

ps
i
was
amused
when
you
mentioned
the
usda
as
an
example
of
an
agency
capable
of
managing
the
an
escrow
im
a
consultant
to
the
usda
and
while
those
i
work
with
are
wonderful
grin
the
agency
itself
is
ranked
in
industry
publications
such
as
govt
computer
news
as
one
of
the
worst
caretakers
of
its
computer
resources
recently
prime

live
did
a
long
segment
on
the

computer
troubles
they
are
making
a
