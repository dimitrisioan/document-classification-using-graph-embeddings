RE
CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
CRIMINALS
WHO
VERY
BADLY
WANT
INSCRUTABLE
TACTICAL
COMMUNICATIONS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
TERRORISTS
AND
DRUG
DEALERS
WHO
PROPONENTS
OF
KEY
ESCROW
CITE
AS
THREATS
WILL
BE
HIGHLY
MOTIVATED
TO
STEAL
THE
CIPHER
PHONE
OF
A
LEGITIMATE
USER
AND
TO
KILL
THIS
PERSON
OR
HOLD
THEM
HOSTAGE
SO
DISCOVERY
OF
COMPROMISE
OF
THE
DEVICE
WILL
BE
DELAYED
WHY
DOING
IT
IN
SUCH
A
ROUGH
MANNER
IT
IS
MUCH
MORE
PROFESSIONAL
TO
STEAL
THE
CHIP
FROM
THE
PHONE
AND
EVEN
TO
REPLACE
IT
WITH
A
PINCOMPATIBLE
DONOTHING
CHIP
THAT
DOES
NOT
ENCRYPT
AT
ALL
CHANCES
ARE
THAT
THE
VICTIM
WILL
NOT
NOTICE
ANYTHING
ESPECIALLY
IF
IT
IS
DONE
PROFESSIONALLY
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
BAD
GUYS
CAN
EASILY
OBTAIN
SUBSTITUTE
CHIPS
WHICH
DONT
CAUSE
ANY
NOTICEABLE
EFFECT
TO
EITHER
THE
USER
OR
THE
PERSON
AT
THE
OTHER
END
OF
THE
LINE
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFICULTY
TO
OBTAINING
SUCH
CHIPS
SOME
OF
THE
CRIMINALS
WILL
DECIDE
TO
FALL
BACK
ON
THE
MURDERKIDNAP
METHOD
ONCE
A
SUITABLE
COLLECTION
OF
DEVICES
IS
STOLEN
CRIMINALS
CAN
COMMUNICATE
WITH
IMPUNITY
ASSUMING
THE
CIPHER
SYSTEM
CARRIES
NO
TRAPDOORS
APART
FROM
KEY
ESCROW
UNTIL
AND
UNLESS
THE
COMPROMISE
IS
DISCOVERED
BY
SOME
OTHER
MEANS
NO
BECAUSE
THE
FEDS
WILL
STILL
BE
ABLE
TO
DECRYPT
THE
CONVERSATIONS
TRUE
THEYLL
BLAME
THE
WRONG
GUYS
BUT
NEVERTHELESS
ONE
CANNOT
SAY
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
DRUGS
ARRIVE
TOMMORROW
ON
THE
SHIP
TERMINUS
WHEN
THE
FEDS
ARE
LISTENING
EVEN
IF
THEY
CANNOT
IDENTIFY
WHO
THE
SPEAKER
IS
THIS
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
FEDS
ARE
TAPPING
CLIPPER
PHONES
BELONGING
TO
ORDINARY
CITIZENS
GETTING
SUCH
A
PHONE
IS
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
THE
CRIME
UNDER
DISCUSSION
TO
BE
SURE
I
WOULDNT
PUT
IT
PAST
THEM
BUT
RAISING
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
SUCH
CRIME
HAS
THE
BENEFIT
OF
FORCING
THE
FEDS
TO
EITHER
FESS
UP
ABOUT
SUCH
INTENTIONS
IN
ADVANCE
OR
STATE
THAT
USING
CLIPPER
EXPOSES
THE
USER
TO
AN
ADDITIONAL
CRIMINAL
THREAT
G
NO
THE
CRIMINALS
WILL
JUST
USE
SOME
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
THE
NEW
PROPOSAL
DOES
NOT
STOP
CRIMINALS
IT
ENSURES
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
WIRETAP
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
AND
STOPS
THE
CASUAL
SNOOPER
TO
ME
IT
ALSO
CLEARLY
LOOKS
AS
A
STEP
TOWARDS
OUTLAWING
ANY
OTHER
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
AGREED
