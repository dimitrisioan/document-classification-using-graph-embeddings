RE
WHAT
THE
CLIPPER
NAYSAYERS
SOUND
LIKE
TO
ME
NATHANIEL
SAMMONS
WROTE
ON
MON
APR
GMT
IF
THE
GOV
ESTABLISHES
A
CRYPTOGRAPHY
STANDARD
THAT
HAS
TO
BE
USED
BY
EVERYONE
AND
EVERYONES
PERSONAL
KEY
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
SEGMENTS
AND
STORED
AT
TWO
SEPARATE
ALBEIT
EASY
TO
FIND
PLACES
AND
THAT
KEY
IS
ONLY
BITS
TO
BEGIN
WITH
WE
ARE
SCREWED
PARDON
THE
ALLUSION
TO
THE
AFFOREMENTIONED
ARTICLE
THE
GOV
I
BELIEVE
AS
DO
MANY
OTHERS
PROBABLY
ALREADY
HAVE
THE
CRACKING
CHIPS
FOR
THIS
CLIPPER
CHIP
MADE
HELL
THEY
PROBABLY
BASED
THE
ENCODER
ON
THE
CHIP
THAT
CRACKS
IT
THAT
WAY
ITS
EASIER
TO
BREAK
THE
CODE
BUT
SINCE
IT
IS
A
CLASSIFIED
ALGORYTHM
NO
ONE
KNOWS
THAT
THEY
CAN
CRACK
IT
SO
EASILY
AGREED
NO
AGENCY
SUCH
AS
THE
NSA
OR
WHOEVER
WOULD
APPROVE
THE
PUBLIC
RELEASE
OF
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
IF
THEY
DIDNT
ALREADY
HAVE
THE
TECHNICAL
MEANS
OR
THE
KNOWHOW
TO
DECRYPT
EVERYTHING
AT
THEIR
WHIM
SURELY
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
ALL
THIS
MADNESS
IS
TO
MAKE
JOE
PUBLIC
THINK
THAT
HISHER
COMMUNICATIONS
WILL
BE
KEPT
SAFE
WHILE
JAMES
BOND
AT
THE
NSA
CAN
IF
NEED
BE
HAVE
FULL
DECRYPTED
ACCESS
TO
SOMEONES
COMMUNICATIONS
THATLL
BE
QUITE
A
HEIST
IF
THEY
CAN
PULL
IT
OFF
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
WERE
GOING
TO
RELEASE
THE
ALGORITHM
TO
A
PANEL
OF
CAREFULLY
CHOSEN
EXPERTS
WHO
WOULD
THEN
STUDY
IT
DEEPLY
AND
REPORT
THEIR
FINDINGS
EXACTLY
WHO
WILL
THESE
PEOPLE
BE
ACADEMICS
OR
GOVERNMENTSPONSORED
RESEARCHERS
TINYTOONS
I
FOR
ONE
AND
QUITE
SCARED
OF
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
AND
PLAN
TO
SUPPORT
ORGANIZATIONS
AND
EVEN
DISORGANIZATIONS
WHO
ARE
FIGHTING
AGAINST
THIS
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
ANY
WAY
THAT
I
CAN
I
CAN
ONLY
HOPE
THAT
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
THING
DOESNT
START
FILTERING
OVER
INTO
THE
EARS
OF
THE
UK
GOVERNMENT
AND
IF
THE
EUROPEAN
PARLIAMENT
GETS
WIND
OF
IT
WELL
WE
CAN
KISS
GOODBYE
TO
ANY
FORM
OF
DEMOCRACY
IN
EUROPE
AT
ALL
I
DO
NOT
WANT
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
ACCESS
EVEN
WITH
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
TO
MY
KEYS
AND
I
DONT
WANT
THOSE
KEYS
TO
BE
