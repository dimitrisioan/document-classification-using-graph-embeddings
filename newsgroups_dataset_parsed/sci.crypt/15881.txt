WRITES
AS
ONE
OF
THE
HAPPILY
SLEEPING
PEOPLE
I
WOULD
JUST
LIKE
TO
ASK
THIS
ARENT
PEOPLE
JUST
SLIGHTLY
OVERREACTING
TO
THIS
OR
ARE
WE
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN
GOING
TO
DRAW
PARALLELS
TO
NAZI
GERMANY
AND
COMMUNIST
RUSSIA
THE
POINT
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
THAT
YES
THIS
IS
A
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
END
OF
THE
WORLD
GUESS
WHAT
WERE
DOING
SOMETHING
NOW
YOU
CANT
DO
IN
A
COMMUNIST
COUNTRY
OR
NAZI
GERMANY
WERE
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
IT
OR
RATHER
YOURE
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
IT
AND
NOBODY
IS
SHOOTING
AT
US
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KEEP
IT
THAT
WAY
THATS
THE
POINT
BY
REACTING
STRONGLY
AND
FORCEFULLY
NOW
WE
WILL
ASSURE
THAT
WE
CONTINUE
TO
REMAIN
FREE
YOU
CANNOT
OVERREACT
TO
A
THREAT
LIKE
THIS
THE
WORST
THAT
HAPPENS
IF
WE
OVERREACT
IS
THAT
WE
WASTE
TIME
AND
EFFORT
THE
WORST
THAT
HAPPENS
IF
WE
UNDERREACT
IS
TYRANNY
I
PREFER
OVERREACTION
MYSELF
GUESS
WHAT
PEOPLE
YOU
LIVE
IN
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
COUNTRIES
IN
THE
WORLD
WHERE
A
PERSON
CAN
COMPLAIN
WITHOUT
GETTING
SHOT
AT
DOESNT
THAT
TELL
YOU
HOW
PRECIOUS
AND
HARD
TO
MAINTAIN
FREEDOM
IS
ONLY
THROUGH
CENTURIES
OF
OVERREACTION
HAVE
WE
MANAGED
TO
MAINTAIN
OURSELVES
IN
THIS
STATE
OF
EVEN
MODERATE
FREEDOM
I
SUGGEST
THAT
OVERREACTING
NOW
AND
IN
THE
FUTURE
IS
A
GOOD
THING
