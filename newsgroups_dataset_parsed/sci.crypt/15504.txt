CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
IF
CLIPPER
COMES
TO
CELLULAR
PHONES
ALONG
WITH
LEGAL
PROSCRIPTIONS
AGAINST
USING
OTHER
CIPHER
SYSTEMS
ON
THESE
PHONES
A
NEW
AND
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
CLASS
OF
CRIME
IS
CREATED
CRIMINALS
WHO
VERY
BADLY
WANT
INSCRUTABLE
TACTICAL
COMMUNICATIONS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
TERRORISTS
AND
DRUG
DEALERS
WHO
PROPONENTS
OF
KEY
ESCROW
CITE
AS
THREATS
WILL
BE
HIGHLY
MOTIVATED
TO
STEAL
THE
CIPHER
PHONE
OF
A
LEGITIMATE
USER
AND
TO
KILL
THIS
PERSON
OR
HOLD
THEM
HOSTAGE
SO
DISCOVERY
OF
COMPROMISE
OF
THE
DEVICE
WILL
BE
DELAYED
ONCE
A
SUITABLE
COLLECTION
OF
DEVICES
IS
STOLEN
CRIMINALS
CAN
COMMUNICATE
WITH
IMPUNITY
ASSUMING
THE
CIPHER
SYSTEM
CARRIES
NO
TRAPDOORS
APART
FROM
KEY
ESCROW
UNTIL
AND
UNLESS
THE
COMPROMISE
IS
DISCOVERED
BY
SOME
OTHER
MEANS
BECAUSE
LIFEISCHEAP
CRIMINALS
ARE
CURRENTLY
WILLING
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
TO
STEAL
VERY
LARGE
AND
CONSPICUOUS
PROPERTY
LUXURY
CARS
IT
IS
REASONABLE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THEY
WILL
BE
WILLING
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
TO
STEAL
SMALL
AND
INCONSPICUOUS
PROPERTY
A
CIPHER
CELLULAR
PHONE
JUST
AS
WE
HAVE
SEEN
IN
THE
PAST
WITH
BLUE
BOX
TECHNOLOGY
AND
IN
THE
PRESENT
WITH
MODIFIED
CELLULAR
PHONES
WE
CAN
EXPECT
TO
SEE
AMONG
HIGHSTAKES
CRIMINALS
A
LUCRATIVE
MARKET
FOR
STOLEN
CIPHER
PHONES
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
THE
HIGHSTAKES
CRIMINALS
WILL
PAY
THE
LIFEISCHEAP
TYPES
SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNTS
FOR
STOLEN
INSTRUMENTS
BECAUSE
A
PERSON
IS
TYPICALLY
DISCOVERED
AS
MISSING
OR
DEAD
IN
A
FEW
DAYS
A
STOLEN
INSTRUMENT
WILL
BE
USABLE
FOR
ONLY
A
FEW
DAYS
THERE
WILL
BE
A
CONTINUING
DEMAND
FOR
FRESH
PHONES
FRESH
BODIES
IN
OTHER
WORDS
CLIPPER
AND
SIMILAR
SYSTEMS
HAVE
THE
POTENTIAL
TO
TURN
A
CURRENT
INCONVENIENCE
TO
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
INTO
A
DIRECT
VICIOUS
AND
PERSISTENT
THREAT
TO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
A
CRIMINAL
WERE
TO
APPLY
SOME
ARBITRARY
CIPHER
TO
A
DEVICE
IN
A
MOSTLY
NONCIPHERED
NETWORK
THE
COMMUNICATION
WILL
AT
LEAST
STAND
OUT
AS
BEING
UNUSUAL
AND
PERHAPS
WORTHY
OF
OTHER
MEANS
OF
INVESTIGATION
FINALLY
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
ESSENTIALLY
NO
POSSIBILITY
OF
INTERCEPTING
IN
REALTIME
THE
SCRUTABLE
CONTENT
OF
COMMUNICATIONS
BETWEEN
STOLEN
INSTRUMENTS
THERE
WILL
EXIST
STRONG
MOTIVATION
TO
RECORD
AND
ARCHIVE
ALL
COMMUNICATIONS
IN
THE
NETWORK
FOR
EXPOSTFACTO
SCRUTINY
ONCE
SOME
CRIMINAL
ACT
IS
DISCOVERED
AND
THE
INSTRUMENTS
INVOLVED
HAVE
BEEN
IDENTIFIED
WHILE
RECORDING
AND
ARCHIVING
MAY
NOT
BE
FEASIBLE
FOR
WIRELINE
NETWORKS
IT
IS
PROBABLY
FEASIBLE
ACROSS
THE
MORE
LIMITED
BANDWIDTH
OF
RADIO
NETWORKS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THESE
RECORDINGS
COULD
OPEN
UP
VAST
POTENTIAL
FOR
ABUSE
