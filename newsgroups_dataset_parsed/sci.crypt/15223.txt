AN
OPEN
LETTER
TO
MR
CLINTON
IM
QUITE
ASTONISHED
SHOCKED
AND
APPALLED
AT
THIS
SERIOUS
FRONTAL
ASSAULT
ON
EMERGING
AMERICAN
FREEDOMS
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
NOR
ANY
OTHER
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
HAS
ANY
LEGITIMATE
ROLE
WHATSOEVER
IN
REGULATING
CRYPTOGRAPHY
TO
DO
SO
IS
TANTAMOUNT
TO
REGULATING
ACCEPTABLE
SPEECH
AND
IS
BLATANTLY
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
PERHAPS
WE
SHOULD
RENAME
THIS
YEAR
IN
HONOR
OF
SUCH
AN
ILLUSTRIOUS
PROPOSAL
LET
THE
CRAPPY
CHIP
LIVE
IN
INFAMY
AND
THE
ADMINSTRATION
RECEIVE
GREAT
SHAME
AND
DISCREDIT
FOR
THIS
BIZARRE
MISADVENTURE
I
AM
OUTRAGED
THAT
MY
TAX
MONEY
IS
BEING
USED
TO
DEVELOP
TECHNOLOGY
TO
RESTRICT
MY
FREEDOMS
FAR
BEYOND
REASONABLE
MEASURES
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
WILL
HAVE
MY
FULL
UNCOOPERATION
AND
DISOBEDIENCE
ON
ANY
SERIOUS
THREAT
TO
MY
LIBERTIES
SUCH
AS
THIS
AND
I
CALL
ON
EVERYONE
WITH
AN
INTEREST
IN
A
SENSIBLE
GOVERNMENT
TO
RESIST
AND
DEFY
THIS
PROPOSAL
THE
ADMINISTRATION
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THEY
ARE
MERELY
A
SUBSERVIENT
INSTRUMENT
TO
IMPLEMENT
THE
WILL
OF
THE
PUBLIC
AND
HENCE
ANYONE
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
PROPOSAL
IN
THIS
RESPECT
IS
WHOLLY
NEGLIGENT
AND
REMISS
IN
PERFORMING
THEIR
LAWFUL
DUTY
WHILE
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
CAN
HELP
AMERICANS
PROTECT
BUSINESS
SECRETS
AND
THE
UNAUTHORIZED
RELEASE
OF
PERSONAL
INFORMATION
IT
ALSO
CAN
BE
USED
BY
TERRORISTS
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
OTHER
CRIMINALS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
US
DIPLOMATIC
COMMUNICATIONS
SHOULD
BE
TAPPABLE
BY
THE
UN
WHENEVER
ANY
COUNTRIES
PRODUCE
A
WARRANT
TO
THE
UN
IN
FACT
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
STOP
PAYING
THE
NSA
BILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
A
YEAR
TO
PRODUCE
UNBREAKABLE
CODES
FOR
THIS
REASON
THESE
ACTIONS
VIOLATE
THE
SOVEREIGNITY
OF
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
I
HOPE
MR
CLINTON
IS
SHREWD
ENOUGH
TO
RECOGNIZE
MY
SARCASM
AND
SATIRE
HERE
BUT
IF
HE
ISNT
ITS
A
MODEST
AND
REASONABLE
PROPOSAL
SO
HE
SHOULD
FIND
MERIT
WITH
IT
NEVERTHELESS
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS
NEUTRAL
TECHNOLOGY
IF
EVERYBODY
HAS
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
INCLUDING
POLICEMEN
BUREACRATS
BUSINESSMEN
HOUSEWIVES
THUGS
AND
HOODLUMS
WE
HAVE
A
SUSTAINABLE
EQUILIBRIUM
ANYTHING
LESS
IS
AN
UNWORKABLE
ANTIEGALTARIAN
ARRANGEMENT
INTRINSICALLY
ANTITHETICAL
TO
AMERICAN
FREEDOMS
AND
GUARANTEED
TO
COLLAPSE
UNDER
ITS
OWN
WEIGHT
OF
INHERENT
IMPRACTICALITY
WE
DONT
NEED
TO
COMPROMISE
ON
ISSUES
OF
FREEDOM
FOR
TOO
LONG
THERE
HAS
BEEN
LITTLE
OR
NO
DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
OUR
PRIVATE
SECTOR
AND
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
COMMUNITY
TO
RESOLVE
THE
TENSION
BETWEEN
ECONOMIC
VITALITY
AND
THE
REAL
CHALLENGES
OF
PROTECTING
AMERICANS
FOR
TOO
LONG
OUR
GOVERNMENT
HAS
DEMONSTRATED
ITSELF
TO
BE
INCREASINGLY
HOSTILE
AND
A
SERIOUS
OBSTACLE
TO
ECONOMIC
VITALITY
AND
PROTECTING
AMERICANS
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
WILL
PLAY
AN
INCREASINGLY
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
THAT
INFRASTRUCTURE
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
MUST
ACT
QUICKLY
TO
DEVELOP
CONSISTENT
COMPREHENSIVE
POLICIES
REGARDING
ITS
USE
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
COMMITTED
TO
POLICIES
THAT
PROTECT
ALL
AMERICANS
RIGHT
TO
PRIVACY
WHILE
ALSO
PROTECTING
THEM
FROM
THOSE
WHO
BREAK
THE
LAW
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TO
ACT
QUICKLY
OR
DEVELOP
CONSISTENT
COMPREHENSIVE
POLICIES
PERIOD
AND
EVEN
IF
BY
SOME
GRANDIOSE
MIRACLE
SUCH
A
THING
WERE
POSSIBLE
IT
WOULD
ONLY
BE
AN
EFFICIENT
WAY
TO
DEPRIVE
AMERICAN
CITIZENS
OF
FUNDAMENTAL
AND
INALIENABLE
RIGHTS
THE
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
TO
BE
COMMITTED
TO
LEAVING
PRIVATE
INDUSTRIES
ALONE
ESP
ON
THIS
ISSUE
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
NO
LEGITIMATE
ROLE
IN
REGULATING
THE
CONTENT
OF
COMMUNICATIONS
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
MUST
BE
PREPARED
TO
FORFEIT
THEIR
SURVEILLANCE
BLUDGEON
THEY
ARE
SOON
AND
INEVITABLY
TO
BE
DISARMED
OF
IT
Q
IF
THE
ADMINISTRATION
WERE
UNABLE
TO
FIND
A
TECHNOLOGICAL
SOLUTION
LIKE
THE
ONE
PROPOSED
WOULD
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BE
WILLING
TO
USE
LEGAL
REMEDIES
TO
RESTRICT
ACCESS
TO
MORE
POWERFUL
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
NO
SUCH
LAWS
CAN
BE
CONSTITUTIONALLY
SOUND
AND
THIS
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
A
VEILED
THREAT
WHICH
I
DONT
APPRECIATE
THIS
KIND
OF
EXTORTION
TENDS
TO
AGITATE
ME
AND
OTHERS
INTO
RADICALISM
I
WILL
TRADE
THREATS
FOR
THREATS
AND
VIOLATION
FOR
VIOLATION
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
NOT
SAYING
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
THREATENS
THE
PUBLIC
SAFETY
AND
EFFECTIVE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WE
WILL
PROHIBIT
IT
OUTRIGHT
AS
SOME
COUNTRIES
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
DONE
IF
THE
ADMINISTRATION
DID
SAY
THIS
IT
WOULD
FIND
ITSELF
IMPEACHED
FOR
RECKLESS
AND
OUTRAGEOUS
DISREGARD
OF
ESSENTIAL
ESTABLISHED
ENTRENCHED
AND
EXPLICIT
CONSTITUTIONAL
PRIVACY
GUARANTEES
THE
ADMINISTRATION
WOULD
HAVE
NO
LEGAL
STANDING
WHATSOEVER
SUCH
AN
ACTION
WOULD
BE
EGREGIOUSLY
ILLEGAL
AND
CRIMINAL
AND
WHOLLY
UNTOLERATED
AND
DISREGARDED
BY
VAST
SEGMENTS
OF
THE
POPULATION
NOR
IS
THE
US
SAYING
THAT
EVERY
AMERICAN
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
IS
ENTITLED
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THE
US
COMPRISED
OF
A
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
FANATICALLY
COMMITTED
TO
PRESERVING
THEIR
PRIVACY
IN
THE
FACE
OF
AN
INCREASINGLY
TOTALITARIAN
GOVERNMENT
IS
SAYING
JUST
THAT
TAKE
YOUR
CHIPS
AND
GIVE
THEM
TO
NSA
EMPLOYEES
AS
CHRISTMAS
BONUSES
WE
CAN
RUN
ANY
ALGORITHM
ON
OUR
COMPUTERS
WE
DAMN
WELL
PLEASE
AND
WE
WILL
MAKE
ANY
CHIPS
WE
PLEASE
AND
WE
WILL
SEND
ANY
BIT
PATTERN
OVER
OUR
DATA
HIGHWAYS
WE
PLEASE
AND
IF
YOU
TRY
TO
STOP
US
YOU
WILL
BE
GRADUALLY
OR
ABRUPTLY
DISSOLVED
INTO
NOTHINGNESS
PRIVACY
VS
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
THERE
IS
A
FALSE
TENSION
CREATED
IN
THE
ASSESSMENT
THAT
THIS
ISSUE
IS
AN
EITHEROR
PROPOSITION
THIS
IS
AN
OUTRIGHT
DINGALING
DENNING
LIE
THE
TWO
AIMS
OF
PRIVACY
AND
SURVEILLANCE
ARE
INTRINSICALLY
AND
FUNDAMENTALLY
INCOMPATIBLE
AND
YOU
HAVE
TO
WORK
FOR
THE
NSA
TO
THINK
OTHERWISE
AMERICANS
ARE
ABOUT
TO
DISCOVER
WAYS
THROUGH
THE
USE
OF
TECHNOLOGY
TO
PRESERVE
THEIR
INALIENABLE
BUT
FORGOTTEN
FREEDOMS
THAT
HAVE
SLOWLY
BEEN
ERODED
AWAY
BY
AN
INCREASINGLY
DISTANT
AND
UNRESPONSIVE
AND
UNREPRESENTATIVE
GOVERNMENT
