re
new
encryption
algorithm

actually
this
ones
easy
its
their
job
the
nsa
is
supposed
to
develop
cryptosystems
if
the
government
chooses
to
go
ahead
and
sell
those
cryptosystems
to
the
masses
so
be
it
ah
but
developing
cryptosystems
which
are
specificially
designed
to
protect
the
governments
domestic
spying
capabilities
takes
them
beyond
that
mandate
into
the
forbidden
field
of
domestic
wiretapping
