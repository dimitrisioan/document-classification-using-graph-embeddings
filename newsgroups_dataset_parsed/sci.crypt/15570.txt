are
associated

it
means
that
the

public
stance
is
complicated
with
issues
irrelevant
to
the
encryption
issue
per

there
may
well
be
people
who
care
about
the
encryption
issue
who
dont
care
to
associate
themselves
with
the
network
erotica
issue
or
may
even
disagree
with
the
effs
position
ending
up
with
pallets
of
baggage
to
drag
around
is
a
frequent
problem
with
permanent
organizations
eff
is
no
exception
