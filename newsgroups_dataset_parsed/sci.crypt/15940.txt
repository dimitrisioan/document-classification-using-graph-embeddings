RE
CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
STEVE
BELLOVIN
WRITES
A
WELLTHOUGHTOUT
AND
NEARLY
PERSUASIVE
ARTICLE
ABOUT
WHY
THE
CLIPPER
ARE
WE
STILL
CALLING
IT
CLIPPER
TODAY
OR
HAVE
THEY
FIGURED
OUT
A
NONINFRINGING
WORD
YET
PROTOCOL
IS
ALMOST
AS
GOOD
AS
ONE
CAN
DO
GIVEN
THEIR
MARCHING
ORDES
IN
ARTICLE
SMBRESEARCHATTCOM
STEVEN
BELLOVIN
WRITES
I
ISSUE
THIS
INVITATION
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
WERE
CHARGED
WITH
IMPLEMENTING
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
WITH
COMPLETE
REGARD
FOR
CIVIL
RIGHTS
AND
DUE
PROCESS
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
DIFFERENTLY
IN
ANSWERING
THIS
QUESTION
PLEASE
ACCEPT
NSAS
FUNDAMENTAL
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT
BOTH
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AGAINST
OUTSIDERS
AND
THE
ABILITY
TO
WIRETAP
SOME
DOMESTIC
USERS
IS
NECESSARY
ILL
ACCEPT
THE
SECOND
ASSUMPTION
ONLY
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
IN
MY
VIEW
THE
PRIMARY
REMAINING
FLAW
IS
THAT
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
IS
SECRET
LEADING
TO
SUSPICION
THAT
THERE
IS
A
BACK
DOOR
WITHOUT
COMPLETE
DISCLOSURE
THIS
SUSPICION
CANNOT
BE
DISPELLED
NO
MATTER
HOW
MANY
TRUSTED
EXPERTS
ARE
ALLOWED
TO
LOOK
AT
IT
IN
ISOLATION
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
THIS
WHOLE
THING
WITH
A
PUBLIC
ALGORITHM
THE
ONLY
CONCERN
IVE
SEEN
WITH
MAKING
SKIPJACK
PUBLIC
IS
THAT
SOMEONE
COULD
BUILD
CLIPPERPHONES
WITHOUT
REGISTERING
THE
KEYS
ASSUME
F
CAN
REALLY
BE
KEPT
SECRET
AS
THE
GOVERNMENT
ASSUMES
THEN
AS
PART
OF
THE
INITIAL
CONNECTION
A
CLIPPERPHONE
EXECUTES
A
PROTOCOL
WITH
THE
PSEUDOPHONE
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
THEY
BOTH
KNOW
F
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
INITIATING
PHONE
PICKS
A
NUMBER
Q
AND
SENDS
EQ
F
THE
RECEIVER
SENDS
BACK
F
AND
THE
INITIATOR
SENDS
BACK
F
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
HER
FIRST
PACKET
WASNT
JUST
A
RANDOM
BLOCK
REPEAT
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
WITH
ANOTHER
Q
SO
IT
CANT
BE
DEFEATED
BY
SOMEBODY
BUILDING
UP
A
LIBRARY
OF
SEQUENTIAL
NUMBERS
BY
REMEMBERING
RESPONSES
AND
USING
THOSE
RESPONSES
AS
THE
INITIAL
NUMBERS
OF
SUBSEQUENT
CHALLENGES
THIS
WAY
CLIPPERPHONES
WILL
TALK
ONLY
TO
OTHER
CLIPPERPHONES
OF
COURSE
THE
PSEUDO
COMPANY
CAN
BUILD
THEIR
OWN
PROPRIETARY
SKIPJACK
PHONE
BUT
THE
PRESIDENTIAL
FACT
SHEET
IMPLIES
THAT
THEY
WONT
GET
APPROVAL
FOR
IT
WITHOUT
EQUIVALENT
KEY
ESCROW
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
THIS
PICTURE
IT
DEPENDS
OF
F
STAYING
SECRET
AND
ON
SKIPJACK
BEING
RESISTANT
TO
CRYPTANALYSIS
BUT
THE
GOVERNMENT
APPEARS
TO
BELIEVE
IN
BOTH
OF
THESE
EVEN
IF
THE
PARTICULAR
QA
I
SUGGEST
HAS
SOME
FLAW
I
IMAGINE
THERES
A
ZEROKNOWLEDGEPROOF
PROTOCOL
THAT
DOESNT
SMB
SAYS
THE
THIRD
AND
MOST
SERIOUS
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
CLIPPER
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
EVEN
IF
CARRIED
OUT
STRICTLY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LETTER
OF
THE
LAW
AGREED
MY
VIEW
AND
YOU
CAN
QUOTE
ME
IF
ITS
NOT
WORTH
DOING
ITS
NOT
WORTH
DOING
