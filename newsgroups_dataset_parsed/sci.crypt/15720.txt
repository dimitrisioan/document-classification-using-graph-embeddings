second
question
why
why
is
such
a
strange
procedure
used
and
not
a
real
rng
this
turns
those
in
a
kind
of
bottleneck
for
system
security
the
only
theory
that
makes
any
sense
is
that
and
are
either
the
same
for
all
chips
or
vary
among
very
few
possibilities
so
that
anyone
trying
to
break
the
encryption
by
brute
force
need
only
plow
through
the
possible
serial
numbers
about
one
billion
multiplied
by
the
number
of
different
combinations
