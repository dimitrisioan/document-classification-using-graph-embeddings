RE
CLIPPER
SOME
NEW
THOUGHTS
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
ALGORYTHM
MUST
BE
KEPT
SECRET
OR
PRIVATE
INDIVIDUALS
COULD
MAKE
CLIPPERCLONES
WITH
WHICH
THEY
COULD
TRANSMIT
MESSAGES
WHICH
THE
FEDS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
READY
ACCESS
TO
THIS
IS
CLEARLY
UNACCEPTABLE
I
HOPE
SOMEBODY
STARTS
DOING
THIS
SOON
AFTER
THE
FIRST
ONES
