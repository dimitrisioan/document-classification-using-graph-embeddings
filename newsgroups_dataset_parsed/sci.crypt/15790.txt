THOUGHTS
AND
QUESTIONS
I
JUST
JOINED
THIS
GROUP
RECENTLY
AND
REALLY
DO
NOT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
CRYPTOGRAPHY
BUT
A
COUPLE
THINGS
CAME
TO
MIND
WHILE
READING
THROUGH
THE
POSTS
IS
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
GOING
TO
BE
EXPORTED
IF
NOT
HOW
WILL
PEOPLE
COMMUNICATE
WITH
OTHER
COUNTRIES
WILL
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
THAT
IN
UNCRYPTMODE
WILL
OTHER
ENCRYPTION
TECHNIQUES
BE
LEGAL
ASSUMING
THE
GOVERNMENT
CRACKS
DOWN
ON
USING
OTHERS
WHEN
GOING
OVERSEAS
BUT
NOT
WITHIN
THE
STATES
IVE
READ
ABOUT
AUTHENTICATION
SYSTEMS
THAT
USE
AN
ELECTRONIC
SECURITY
CARD
THAT
LOOKS
LIKE
A
CALCULATOR
TO
CREATE
AN
ENCRYPTED
PIN
BASED
ON
THE
TIMEDATE
THE
HOST
SYSTEM
HAS
THE
ALGORITHM
BUILT
INTO
IT
AS
WELL
SO
THAT
IT
CAN
AUTHENTICATE
A
USER
IS
THERE
SOME
FORM
OF
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
THAT
WOULD
CREATE
KEYS
THAT
ARE
ONLY
VALID
AT
A
CERTAIN
INSTANT
IN
TIME
THE
SYSTEMS
WOULD
THEN
ALLOW
A
WINDOW
OF
TIME
AROUND
THIS
INSTANT
WHERE
THE
KEY
WOULD
WORK
I
REALIZE
THAT
THIS
TECHNIQUE
WOULD
INCREASE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
INFORMATION
NEEDING
TO
BE
STORED
BECAUSE
YOU
WOULD
NEED
ENTIRE
ALGORITHMS
RATHER
THAN
JUST
KEYS
BUT
FOR
SMALLER
SCALE
THINGS
IT
MIGHT
WORK
COULD
SOME
SIMILAR
METHOD
BE
USED
TO
MAKE
THE
TWO
KEYS
THAT
ARE
ISSUED
TO
POLICEFBIETC
TO
TAP
A
PHONE
ONLY
USABLE
FOR
ONEWEEK
FOR
INSTANCE
IF
FURTHER
SURVEILANCE
WAS
NEEDED
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GO
BACK
TO
THE
ESCROW
SERVICE
TO
GET
ANOTHER
KEY
THIS
WOULD
MAKE
IT
USELESS
FOR
LOCAL
POLICE
TO
DATABASE
KEYS
THEY
HAVE
USED
I
ASSUME
THIS
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
THE
RECEIVING
PHONE
WOULD
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DECYPHER
THE
MESSAGE
BUT
ANY
THOUGHTS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
