WRITES
I
HEARD
SOMEWHERE
CANT
NAME
THE
SOURCE
THAT
TEMPEST
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
PICKUP
JUST
CRTS
BUT
IT
CAN
PICK
UP
EMISSIONS
FROM
ALMOST
ANY
CHIP
IF
THAT
IS
TRUE
THE
KIND
MONITOR
WOULD
NOT
MAKE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
BECUASE
EVERYTHING
ON
THE
SCREEN
CAN
BE
PICKEDUP
FROM
THE
VIDEO
CONTROLLER
CAN
ANYBODY
VERIFY
OR
REFUTE
THIS
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
SEVERAL
TIMES
TEMPEST
IS
A
CODEWORD
FOR
A
STANDARD
SHARED
BETWEEN
THE
NATO
GOVERNMENTS
TO
LIMIT
THE
INADVERTENT
EMISSION
OF
INFORMATION
BY
EITHER
ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION
OR
CONDUCTION
THE
LIMITS
SET
IN
THE
STANDARD
ARE
CLASSIFIED
BUT
THERE
IS
OPEN
SOURCE
INFORMATION
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
EITHER
THE
ELECTRICAL
OR
MAGNETIC
COMPONENTS
OF
ELECTROMAGNETISM
CAN
BE
EXPLOITED
IT
IS
A
BASIC
RULE
OF
PHYSICS
THAT
THERE
IS
AN
ELECTROMAGNETIC
FIELD
ASSOCIATED
WITH
ANY
PATH
THAT
CONDUCTS
A
FLOW
OF
ELECTRONS
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
I
DRIVE
A
KOREAN
BUILT
AT
CLONE
AND
AN
ASSOCIATED
PIN
DOTMATRIX
PRINTER
THE
MAJOR
SOURCE
OF
UNINTENTIONAL
EMISSION
IS
THE
CRT
TO
THAT
CAN
BE
ADDED
THE
VIDEO
DRIVER
CARD
THE
PARALLEL
CABLE
AND
THE
PRINTER
HEAD
THE
EMISSIONS
FROM
THESE
ARE
GROSS
CAN
BE
DETECTED
WITH
THE
CRUDEST
OF
EQUIPMENT
WERE
I
TO
APPLY
GOOD
TEST
EQUIPMENT
AND
SOME
INTELLIGENCE
TO
MEASURING
EMISSION
LEVELS
I
WOULD
FIND
MANY
OTHER
POTENTIAL
SOURCES
OF
LEAKED
INFORMATION
WHERE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS
USED
FOR
SERIOUS
PURPOSES
POOR
TEMPEST
PROTECTION
BECOMES
AN
IMPORTANT
SECURITY
HAZARD
IN
THE
EARLY
EIGHTIES
THE
NEED
TO
ALLOW
SOME
COMMERCIAL
CONCERNS
PARTICULARLY
FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS
A
LEVEL
OF
PROTECTION
AGAINST
TEMPEST
THREAT
LED
TO
A
SERIES
OF
BRIEFINGS
TO
INVITED
CORPORATIONS
AND
TO
THE
RELEASE
OF
A
CUTDOWN
TEMPEST
STANSARD
FOR
COMMERCIAL
USE
I
SAY
RELEASE
FOR
WHILE
EQUIPMENT
TO
MEET
THE
STANDARD
IS
AVAILABLE
AT
A
PRICE
AND
TO
APPROVED
CUSTOMERS
AFAIK
EVEN
THE
COMMERCIAL
STANDARD

CLASSIFIED
