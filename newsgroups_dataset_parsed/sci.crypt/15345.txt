ANDREW
MOLITOR
WRITES
YES
THOSE
EVIL
GUYS
IN
THE
FBI
CAN
PROBABLY
WITH
SOME
EFFORT
ABUSE
THE
SYSTEM
I
GOT
NEWS
FOR
YOU
IF
THE
EVIL
GUYS
IN
THE
FBI
DECIDE
THEY
WANT
TO
PERSECUTE
YOU
THEYRE
GONNA
AND
IF
RICHARD
NIXON
HAD
HAD
THIS
KIND
OF
TOY
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
HAD
TO
SEND
PEOPLE
INTO
THE
WATERGATE
THIS
APPEARS
TO
BE
GENERIC
CALLING
UPON
THE
NAME
OF
THE
ANTICHRIST
JUST
FOR
THE
HELL
OF
IT
LETS
DESTROY
THIS
REMARK
LET
US
IMAGINE
THAT
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
ACTUALLY
COULD
EXTRACT
KEYS
FROM
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
WITHOUT
ANYONE
KNOWING
OR
TELLING
NOW
WHAT
DICK
HAS
BITS
OF
DATA
WHAT
THE
HELLS
HE
GONNA
DO
WITH
IT
TROT
AROUND
TO
THE
TELCO
AND
SAY
WED
LIKE
AN
UNAUTHORISED
DECRYPTING
TAP
UH
HUH
BREAK
IN
TO
WATERGATE
AND
INSTALL
HIS
OWN
TAP
SO
HIS
PEOPLE
STILL
DO
HAVE
TO
BREAK
IN
NEAT
HUH
RECORD
SOME
NOISE
THEN
GET
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
PHONE
DECRYPTION
BOX
HUH
THEYVE
GOT
ONE
GOODNESS
WAIT
TIL
THE
WASHINGTON
POST
GETS
HOLD
OF
THIS
AND
DECRYPT
THE
NOISE
MORE
LIKELY
STARE
AT
THE
KEY
AND
SAY
OH
HELL
ITS
NOT
WORTH
ALL
THIS
BLOODY
HASSLE
TRUTH
IS
EVEN
GRANTED
LOTS
OF
COVERT
POWER
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
THIS
SYSTEM
IS
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
TAP
WITH
THAN
POTS
GEAR
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
IS
EASIER
TO
TAP
THAN
SOME
HYPOTHETICAL
SYSTEM
NEITHER
YOU
NOR
I
AM
GOING
TO
PLACE
ON
OUR
PHONES
IS
NEITHER
HERE
NOR
THERE
THE
ONLY
RATIONAL
CONCERNS
I
AM
SEEING
RAISED
ARE
A
IS
THE
KEY
REALLY
JUST
CHOPPED
IN
HALF
AND
NOT
SOME
XOR
ARRANGEMENT
THAT
IS
HAS
SOME
EGREGIOUS
TECHNICAL
ERROR
BEEN
BUILT
IN
TO
THE
PLAN
B
IS
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
STEP
TOWARD
STRICT
REGULATION
OF
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
BUT
THATS
NOT
REALLY
THE
ISSUE
THE
REAL
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
THIS
WILL
BE
USED
TO
JUSTIFY
A
BAN
AGAINST
INDIVIDUALS
USE
OF
PRIVATE
IE
ANYTHING
ELSE
ENCRYPTION
METHODS
THIS
IS
B
OF
COURSE
I
SUSPECT
NOT
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
ACTUALLY
WANTED
TO
MAKE
SUCH
REGS
THEYD
JUST
DO
IT
A
FEW
HUNDRED
PEOPLE
ON
USENET
YELLING
ABOUT
IT
WOULDNT
EVEN
SLOW
THE
MACHINE
DOWN
BESIDES
WHO
IS
THIS
MYSTERIOUS
THEY
WHOS
GOING
TO
TAKE
AWAY
ALL
OUR
RIGHTS
THE
INSTANT
WE
LET
OUR
GUARD
DOWN
CONGRESS
THAT
GANG
OF
BUFFOONS
CANT
EVEN
BALANCE
THEIR
CHECKBOOKS
THE
FBI
BUT
THEY
DONT
MAKE
THE
LAWS
THE
NSA
DITTO
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
BILL
CLINTON
IS
PROBABLY
STILL
LOOKING
FOR
THE
BATHROOM
ITS
A
BIG
PLACE
