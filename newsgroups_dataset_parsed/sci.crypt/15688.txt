re
i
have
seen
the
lobby
and
it
is
us
i
agree
that
notifying
your
elected
officials
of
your
feelings
on
this
and
any
other
for
that
matter
issue
is
the
way
to
go
and
by
the
way
the
phone
s
on
the
list
posted
the
other
day
were
all
in
washington
dc
for
most
of
you
your
elected
officials
will
also
maintain
a
local
office
in
your
area
code
when
i
manage
my
elected
officials
i
use
their
local
office
s
exclusively
and
my
fax
modem
and
windowsprintcapture
software
are
my
tool
of
choice
they
see
my
words
as
i
have
stated
them
rather
than
a
summary
as
they
would
if
i
called
in
voice
and
left
a
comment
with
the
office
staff
