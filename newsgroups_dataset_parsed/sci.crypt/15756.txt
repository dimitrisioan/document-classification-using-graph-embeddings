c
code
where
victor

wrote
numerical
recipes
in
cfortranpascal
has
a
nice
section
on
encryption
and
decryption
based
on
the
des
algorithm
there
is
also
source
code
provided
i
think
some
versions
of
this
book
are
distributed
with
the
source
code
on
disk
the
source
code
can
also
be
ordered
from
the

yes
i
benchmarked
the
des
implementation
in
the
recipes
in
c
book
it
is
about
orders
of
magnitude
slower
than
the
outerbridgekarngilloglyet
al
implementation
it
may
be
instructional
but
it
isnt
very
fast
