code

most
other
platforms
including

many
ftp
sites
keep
a
copy

havent
looked
in
the
archive
to
see
if
it
has
source
or
not
usually
because
i
cant
handle
the
format
for
fidonet
freq
magicnames
the
pgps
names
are
source
code
others
are
either
execs
or
execs
src
extras
or
in
the
case
of
next
just
a
patch
you
still
need
one
of
the
full
source
code
packages
nitvbbs
is
free
this
is
not
an
ad
