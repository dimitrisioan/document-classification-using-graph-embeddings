THE

ATTACK
FOR
GUARRENTTEING
OUR
RIGHTS

PERHAPS
WE
SHOULD
REFLECT
ON
THIS
AS
WELL
PERHAPS
FIRE
ARMS
ARE
NOT
THE
ONLY
WEAPONS
COVERED
UNDER
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
HMMM
I
WOULDNT
CONSIDER
ENCRYPTION
TO
BE
A
WEAPON
HOW
WOULD
THE
GOVERNMENT
CLASSIFY
ENCRYPTION
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ENCRYPTION
OUGHT
TO
BE
COVERED
BY
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
USING
THIS
LINE
OF
REASONING
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
RESTRICT
WHAT
DATA
PEOPLE
ENCRYPT
AND
WHAT
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHMS
THEY
USE
BECAUSE
THIS
WOULD
BE
RESTRICTING
ONES
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
IN
OTHER
WORDS
ENCRYPTED
DATATEXT
GRAPHICS
OR
OTHER
INFORMATIONIS
JUST
ANOTHER
FORM
OF
FREE
SPEECH
FOR
THIS
REASON
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
REGULATE
THE
USE
OF
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHMS
AND
ENCRYPTED
DATA
THE
ONLY
TIME
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
FORCE
SOMEONE
TO
REVEAL
HIS
OR
HER
ENCRYPTION
KEYS
FOR
SOME
ENCRYPTED
DATA
IS
WHEN
THE
ENCRYPTED
DATA
IN
QUESTION
MAY
BE
SOMETHING
THAT
ISNT
PROTECTED
BY
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
SUCH
AS
KIDDY
PORN
EVEN
IN
A
CASE
LIKE
THIS
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
BE
REQUIRED
TO
GET
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
BEFORE
COERCING
SOMEONE
INTO
REVEALING
THE
KEYS
BTW
