machine
was
re
corporate
acceptance
of
the
wiretap
chip
at
the
company
i
worked
for
previously
i
received
a
file
that
was
des
encryped
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
weeks
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
only
took
days
to
crack
the
file
no
i
dont
have
any
faith
in
des
ag
fun
three
questions
what
hardware
did
you
use
when
you
found
the
key
was
there
anything
about
it
that
was
special
that
meant
you
had
been
lucky
to
find
it
early
like
the
first
bits
all
being
or
did
you
mean
a
dictionary
attack
rather
than
a
binary
key
attack
