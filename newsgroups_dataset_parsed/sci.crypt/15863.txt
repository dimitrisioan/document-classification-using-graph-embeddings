WRITES
THATS
ONE
PROBLEM
THAT
HAS
SO
FAR
BEEN
OVERLOOKED
THESE
TWO
ESCROW
AGENCIES
WILL
HAVE
TO
CREATE
A
SECURE
DATABASE
AND
SERVICE
THE
INPUT
AND
OUTPUT
OF
KEYS
WHO
PAYS
FOR
THIS
IF
THEY
REFUSE
AN
ILLEGAL
REQUEST
FROM
SOME
CONGRESSMAN
TO
DELIVER
A
KEY
CAN
THEIR
BUDGET
BY
CUT
TO
PUNISH
THEM
WILL
CONGRESS
BE
FORCED
TO
FUND
THEM
FOREVER
THE
EASIEST
WAY
IS
A
USER
FEE
FOR
EACH
CLIPPER
CHIP
MANUFACTURED
THIS
MAKES
THE

BREAKS

AND
THE

ASSUMING
THAT

HAVENT
PROHIBITED

IN
THE
MEANTIME
IN

MAYBE
THIS

BE

OF
THE
OFFICIAL

BEFORE
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
ALLOWED
TO
MOVE
THIS
PAST
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
STAGE
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
TO
DEMONSTRATE
ECONOMIC
VIABILITY
BY
MASS
ADOPTION
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
VERY
FOND
OF
DEMONSTRATION
PROJECTS
PROVING
FEASIBILITY
IN
THE
USE
OF
GOVERNMENT
FUNDS
FOR
SOCIAL
PROGRAMSTHEY
SHOULD
HAVE
TO
MAKE
A
SIMILAR
FEASIBILITY
DEMONSTRATION
ON
ECONOMIC
VIABILITY
CUM
ACCEPTANCE
