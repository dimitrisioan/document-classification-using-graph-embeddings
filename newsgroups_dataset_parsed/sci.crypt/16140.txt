WRITES
LOOKING
AT
IT
FROM
UP
HERE
IN
THE
FROZEN
NORTH
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
YOU
COULD
DO
WORSE
THAN
GET
THE
NRA
INVOLVED
THEY
HAVE
A
KINDRED
PROBLEM
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
VOTERS
THE
RIGHT
ATTITUDE
AND
LOTS
OF
FUNDS
THEY
ALSO
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
THE
OTHER
VOTERS
REALLY
IRRITATED
AT
THEM
FROM
AN
ETHICAL
OR
CONSTITUTIONAL
VIEWPOINT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
A
GOOD
ARGUMENT
FOR
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
RIGHTS
THAT
DOESNT
ALSO
SUPPORT
THE
NRA
POSITION
ON
GUNS
AND
VICEVERSA
OKAY
FOLKS
I
KNOW
IM
IN
THE
MINORITY
ON
THIS
ISSUE
BUT
I
CANT
LET
THIS
ASSERTION
GO
UNCHALLENGED
YET
AGAIN
IM
GOING
TO
SAY
THIS
ONLY
ONCE
IN
THE
HOPES
OF
NOT
STARTING
A
FLAME
WAR
OFF
OF
THE
MAIN
TOPIC
GUNS
ARE
OFFENSIVE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS
DEFENSIVE
SEE
THE
DIFFERENCE
THE
ONLY
WAY
YOU
CAN
USE
A
GUN
IS
TO
HURT
SOMEBODY
ELSE
CRYPTO
GRAPHY
HELPS
PREVENT
OTHER
PEOPLE
FROM
HURTING
YOU
SORRY
FOR
THE
DIGRESSION
LETS
NOT
FORGET
THE
ISSUE
THAT
WE
DO
AGREE
ON
WE
WANT
CONTINUED
ACCESS
TO
CRYPTO
TECHNOLOGY
OF
OUR
CHOICE
WITHOUT
KEY
REGISTRATION
