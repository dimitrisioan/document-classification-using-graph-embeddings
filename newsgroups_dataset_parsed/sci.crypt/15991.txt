KEY
EXCHANGE
I
WANT
TO
ADD
LINK
ENCRYPTION
TO
A
MODULE
THAT
MULTIPLEXES
UPPER
LEVEL
ROUTINES
INTO
A
SINGLE
DATA
LINK
THE
UPPER

WONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
AND
THUS
KEY

SHALL
ONLY
NEED
TO
OCCUR
ONCE
AT
THE

ESTABLISHMENT
I
FIGURE
THAT
I
CAN
DO
THIS
WITH

AND
A
DIFFIEHELLMAN
KEY

IS
USING
A
DIFFIEHELLMAN

TO
ESTABLISH
A

WHAT
ARE
THE
PROS

OF
SUCH
A

ARE
THERE
ANY
IMPORTANT
ISSUES
TO
WATCH
OUT
FOR
ASIDE
FROM
FILTERING
OUT
UNACCEPTABLE
KEYS
AND
IN
ORDER
TO
ACHIEVE
THIS
I
GUESS
I
WILL
NEED
TO
USE
MATH
ROUTINES
FOR
PROBABLE

SO
COULD
SOMEONE
POINT
ME
TOWARDS
A
GOOD
