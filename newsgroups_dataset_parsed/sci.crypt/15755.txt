true
theyll

cannot

the
drugs
arrive
tommorrow
on
the

terminus
when
the
feds
are
listening
even
if
they
cannot
identify
who
the
speaker
is
its
not
a
question
just
of
who
is
holding
the
phone
its
a
question
of
what
circuit
to
wiretap
in
the
first
place
if
two
drug
dealers
are
both
using
stolen
cellular
phones
the
fbi
doesnt
know
which
lines
to
tap
unless
of
course
theyre
tapping
all
phones
maybe
all
cellular
phones
if
they
havent
tapped
the
connection
ie
at
least
one
end
of
the
connection
then
they
dont
know
what
