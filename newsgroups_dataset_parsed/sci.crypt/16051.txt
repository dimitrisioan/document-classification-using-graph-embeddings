guess
what
people
you
live
in
one
of
the
few
countries
in
the
world
where
a
person
can
complain
without
getting
shot
at
only
guessing
but
from
his
address
id
say
that
jerry
like
me
lives
in
canada
unlike
me
he
thinks
that
our
friends
in
the
us
enjoy
the
same
freedom
that
we
do
and
he
has
not
seen
the
slow
but
steady
erosion
to
the
south
of
us
we
have
the
benefit
of
relatively
slow
politicians
and
ineffective
law
enforcement
our
rednecks
tend
to
be
the
objects
of
derision
rather
than
elected
officials
its
everything
le
can
do
to
keep
up
with
the
real
criminals
any
time
they
actually
go
after
somebody
just
because
they
dont
like
his
or
her
attitude
its
national
news
it
also
often
blows
up
in
their
faces
eg
the
wellintentioned
but
flawed
zundel
case
which
resulted
in
a
scolding
from
the
supreme
court
not
only
to
le
for
prosecuting
the
case
but
to
parliament
for
passing
the
law
it
was
prosecuted
under
our
friends
south
of
the
border
dont
have
as
easy
a
time
of
it
among
other
things
they
have
as
many
le
agencies
as
we
have
agencies
and
some
of
them
have
teeth
they
also
have
the
war
on
drugs
which
gives
lawenforcement
agencies
exceptional
powers
to
ignore
individuals
rights
the
dea
has
more
arbitrary
power
than
that
given
to
canadian
agencies
under
the
war
measures
act
we
have
the
rcmp
and
csis
who
cant
stop
fighting
each
other
long
enough
to
do
any
really
effective
suppression
of
private
citizens
rights
not
only
that
our
police
commissions
have
teeth
as
i
learned
when
i
had
to
fend
off
a
bent
cop
it
may
be
ironic
that
the
nation
founded
on
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
is
getting
governmentimposed
order
while
the
nation
founded
on
peace
order
and
good
government
is
getting
inyourface
liberty
thats
not
to
say
our
time
wont
come
it
looks
like
chretien
is
going
to
run
on
a
lawandorder
platform
be
afraid
