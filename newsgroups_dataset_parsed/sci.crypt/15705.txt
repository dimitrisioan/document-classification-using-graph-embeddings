hmmm
we
must
assume
that
generating
the
unit
key
u
from
the
serial
number
n
rather
than
generating
it
from
a
randomly
selected
and
is
an
intentional
way
of
assuring
a
fail
safe
for
the
government
u
is
completedly
determined
given
and
n
if
and
do
not
change
even
if
they
remain
secret
i
wonder
if
they
can
somehow
be
backderived
given
enough
unit
keyserial
number
pairs
maybe
such
pairs
suffice
to
reconstruct
and
by
such
a
back
door
in
the
encryption
algorithm
perhaps
it
would
be
possible
for
the
manufacturer
to
get
the
keys
of
all
chips
that
were
programmed
in
one
session
this
would
not
btw
enable
anybody
else
to
retrieve
the
keys
in
the
same
way
because
theyll
never
get
a
bunch
of
nu
pairs
with
identical
and
note
that
these
have
to
be
constant
for
the
whole
batch
by
the
very
nature
of
the
procedure
ie
they
have
to
be
typed
in
manually
by
the
random
number
supplying
agents
and
i
was
wondering
why
theyll
always
do
chips
in
one
session
since
the
procedure
described
by
ms
denning
imposes
high
costs
on
the
production
of
every
chip
at
least
three
persons
for
one
hour
each
plus
the
cost
of
a
laptop
finally
blown
to
pieces
in
a
spectacular
hollywoodlike
bonfire
add
travelling
expenses
drinks
and
lighting
divide
the
sum
by
there
wont
be
a
larger
demand
not
from
the
private
sector
anyway
and
let
me
mention
one
other
thought
that
certainly
has
occurred
to
all
the
notoriously
paranoid
people
in
this
group
before
who
is
going
to
verify
that
no
interested
party
will
perform
tempest
attacks
on
the
vault
where
theres
so
much
smoke
and
mirrors
there
cant
be
a
nice
honest
fire
but
something
really
worth
