THE
ALGORITHM
IS
CLASSIFIED
BECAUSE
A
MILITARY
CONTRACT
OR
SIMILAR
GOVERNMENT
EQUIVALENT
TO
MILITARY
HAS
BEEN
LET
FOR
THIS
PROPRIETARY
DESIGN
THAT
THE
FEDS
SAY
THAT
NSA
DEVELOPED
IS
THERE
A
PATENT
IS
THAT
PATENT
PUBLICLY
AVAILABLE
MY
BETTING
IS
THAT
THAT
TOO
IS
CLASSIFIED
UNLESS
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
MAJOR
CHANGE
IN
THE
LAW
THERES
NO
SUCH
BEAST
AS
A
CLASSIFIED
PATENT
PATENTS
EXIST
TO
ENCOURAGE
COMMUNICATIONS
AND
DEVELOP
THE
STATE
OF
THE
ART
WHILE
THERE
ARENT
CLASSIFIED
PATENTS
THERE
ARE
PATENT
SECRECY
ORDERS
SUPPOSE
YOU
INVENT
A
VOICE
SCRAMBLER
FOR
CB
RADIO
AND
APPLY
FOR
A
PATENT
THE
PATENT
OFFICE
DECIDES
THE
NSA
MIGHT
BE
INTERESTED
GIVES
THEM
A
COPY
OF
YOUR
APPLICATION
AND
YOU
GET
A
NICE
NOTE
BACK
SAYING
YOUR
PATENT
APPLICATION
HAS
NOW
BEEN
CLASSIFIED
FOR
NATIONAL
SECURITY
REASONS
AND
YOURE
NO
LONGER
ALLOWED
TO
MAKE
AND
SELL
IT
IM
PICKING
THIS
EXAMPLE
BECAUSE
IT
HAPPENED
IN
THE
LATE
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
SOME
ANALOG
SCRAMBLER
AND
WOULD
HAVE
PROBABLY
VIOLATED
FCC
RULES
ANYWAY
BUT
IT
DID
GET
CLASSIFIED
OR
SUPPOSE
YOU
PUBLISH
A
PAPER
ON
YOUR
REALLY
SPIFFY
ALGORITHM
AND
THEN
FILE
A
PATENT
APPLICATION
SINCE
ITS
BEEN
PUBLISHED
THEY
CANT
GAIN
ANYTHING
BY
CLASSIFYING
IT
THOUGH
YOU
CANT
GET
PATENTS
IN
MOST
COUNTRIES
OTHER
THAN
THE
US
WHERE
PATENT
LAWS
ARE
DIFFERENT
OBVIOUSLY
A
SYSTEM
OF
CLASSIFIED
PATENTS
WOULD
BE
HIGHLY
BOGUS
YOU
CANT
SELL
THAT
WIDGET
BECAUSE
THERES
A
CLASSIFIED
PATENT
ON
IT
YOURE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
SEE
THE
PATENT
OR
KNOW
WHO
OWNS
THE
DESIGN
SO
JUST
GIVE
US
ALL
YOUR
MONEY
AND
WORK
IN
PROGRESS
AND
MAYBE
WE
WONT
THROW
YOU
IN
JAIL
FOR
ESPIONAGE
SOME
COUNTRIES
MIGHT
HAVE
THAT
KIND
OF
SYSTEM
BUT
WE
DONT
HAVE
THAT
HERE
QUITE
YET

PEACE
