RE
THE
SECRET
SOURCE
OF
THAT
ANNOUNCEMENT
IN
ARTICLE
PETER
GUTMANN
WRITES
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
HAS
HAPPENED
TO
ME
AGES
AGO
WHEN
WE
WERE
WORKING
ON
PGP
WE
USED
TO
SEND
SHORT
MESSAGES
ABOUT
DEVELOPMENT
ISSUES
OR
SIMPLY
TO
TEST
NEW
FEATURES
AROUND
NOW
AT
THIS
TIME
PGP
AND
CERTAINLY
THE
NEWER
VERSION
WAS
UNKNOWN
OVER
HERE
SUDDENLY
THE
ADMIN
AT
THE
SITE
I
WAS
USING
RECEIVED
A
REQUEST
THAT
I
STOP
SENDING
ENCRYPTED
EMAIL
NOW
THERE
IS
ALMOST
NO
WAY
THAT
SOME
AUTOMATIC
SCANNER
COULD
HAVE
FOUND
THIS
SINCE
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
KNOWN
ABOUT
PGP
THEY
MUST
HAVE
CHECKED
FOR
UNKNOWN
DATA
TYPES
IN
THE
MESSAGE
TRIED
TO
UNSCRAMBLE
IT
FOUND
THEY
COULDNT
GET
PAST
THE
PEM
ARMOUR
PART
AND
THEN
CONTACTED
THE
SYSADMIN
AND
ASKED
ME
TO
STOP
LUCKILY
THE
CURRENT
EMAIL
CARRIERS
ARE
LESS
PICKY
ABOUT
WHAT
GOES
OVER
THEIR
NETWORKS
IS
THE
SENDING
OF
ENCRYPTED
TRAFFIC
WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT
PERMISSION
LEGAL
IN
NEW
ZEALAND
