so
dont
just
think
of
replacements
for
clipper
also
think
of
front
ends
this
only
makes
sense
if
the
government
prohibits
alternative
nonescrowed
encryption
schemes
otherwise
why
not
just
use
the
front
end
without
clipper
because
everyone
but
you
expects
that
making
alternative
methods
of
encryption
illegal
is
the
next
step
otherwise
the
cripple
chip
is
utterly
worthless
it
should
be
obvious
that
a
the
cripple
chip
is
aimed
at
spying
on
ordinary
citizens
or
b
that
other
forms
of
encryption
will
soon
be
illegal
