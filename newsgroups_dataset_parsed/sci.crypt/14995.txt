there
is
no

that
the
deleted
space
would
be
overwritten
during
optimization
likely
but
no
guarantee
a
quicker
and
more
secure
method
would
be
a
batch

that
overwrote
all
of
your

it
is
much
easier
faster
and
probably
even
more
secure
to

to

to

the

space
and

clean
the
slack

at
the
end
of
the

use
to

standard
option
for
more
careful
overwriting
