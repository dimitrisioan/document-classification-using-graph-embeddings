corporate
acceptance
of
the

writes
what
follows
is
my
opinion
it
is
not
asserted
to
be
the
truth
so
no
flames
please
it
comes
out
of
a
background
of
years
as
a
senior
corporate
staff
executive
in
two
fortune
companies
id
be
happy
to
use
a
crypto
system
supplied
by
the
nsa
for
business
if
they
told
me
it
was
more
secure
than
des
and
in
particular
resistant
to
attempts
by
japanese
french
and
other
competitive
companies
and
governments
to
break
id
be
happy
to
do
so
even
with
escrowed
keys
provided
i
was
happy
about
the
bona
fides
of
the
escrow
agencies
the
federal
reserve
would
certainly
satisfy
me
as
would
something
set
up
by
one
of
the
big
accounting
firms
i
dont
doubt
that
this
will
be
the
attitude
of
many
corporate
leaders
its
understandablemost
corporate
execs
dont
know
much
about
cryptology
and
its
easy
to
get
taken
in
by
someone
peddling
snake
oil
and
the
proposed
scheme
is
a
major
improvement
in
telephone
security
to
what
exists
now
the
problem
is
that
with
any
security
scheme
of
this
kind
you
have
to
concern
yourself
with
the
weakest
link
in
the
chain
i
suspect
that
nsa
has
put
a
fairly
strong
encryption
algorithm
in
this
wiretap
chip
of
theirs
probably
at
least
as
strong
as
say
des
in
ofbmode
unfortunately
the
existence
of
the
keyregistry
system
seems
to
make
possible
all
kinds
of
possible
attacks
at
a
small
fraction
of
the
expense
of
trying
to
build
say
a
des
keysearch
machine
as
originally
described
it
sounded
like
any
police
court
combination
could
acquire
the
key
for
a
given
chip
i
hope
thats
not
the
case
since
it
would
imply
a
glaring
hole
how
much
does
it
cost
to
find
one
crooked
jodge
and
one
crooked
cop
especially
for
a
foreign
intelligence
agency
or
organized
crime
boss
however
even
if
more
intelligent
schemes
are
used
to
allow
access
to
the
unencrypted
phone
conversations
there
will
be
weak
nesses
they
may
be
very
expensive
and
very
difficult
but
who
would
trust
hisher
confidential
information
to
an
encryption
scheme
that
for
say
could
by
cracked
one
time
in
a
hundred
des
for
all
the
complaints
about
a
key
would
probably
cost
several
million
dollars
to
build
a
keysearch
machine
for
how
many
million
dollars
would
the
confidential
phone
messages
of
the
gm
headquarters
be
worth
to
nissan
chrysler
or
audi
how
about
home
phones
of
major
execs
and
important
engineers
and
designers
gee
mr
jones
i
understand
youve
had
some
financial
problems
lately
maybe
i
can
help
id
trust
something
from
the
nsa
long
before
id
trust
something
from
some
swiss
or
anybody
japanese
indeed
if
nsa
really
designed
the
algorithm
to
be
secure
its
very
likely
as
secure
as
idea
or
des
however
the
system
as
a
whole
isnt
resistant
to
practical
cryptanalysis
in
the
puzzle
palace
bamford
describes
how
several
nsa
employees
were
turned
by
foreign
presumably
kgb
agents
despite
security
measures
that
i
doubt
any
big
accounting
firm
could
match
and
nsa
confidential
data
was
not
subject
to
being
requested
by
thousands
of
police
organizations
and
courts
across
the
land
