OF
WHITE
HOUSE
ANNOUNCEMENT

QAS
ON
CLIPPER

BRADCLARINETCOM
BRAD
TEMPLETON
WRITES
THEIR
STRATEGY
IS
A
BUSINESS
ONE
RATHER
THAN
LEGAL
ONE
THEY
ARE
PUSHING
TO
GET
A
STANDARD
IN
PLACE
A
SECRET
STANDARD
AND
IF
THEY
GET
IT
AS
A
STANDARD
THEN
THEY
WILL
DRIVE
COMPETITORS
OUT
OF
THE
MARKET
IT
WILL
BE
LEGAL
TO
SELL
BETTER
UNTAPABLE
ENCRYPTION
THAT
DOESNT
HAVE
REGISTERED
KEYS
BUT
IT
WILL
BE
DIFFICULT
AND
THUS
NOT
A
PLAN
FOR
MOST
PHONE
COMPANIES
IF
BRADS
ANALYSIS
IS
CORRECT
IT
MAY
OFFER
AN
EXPLANATION
FOR
WHY
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
IS
BEING
KEPT
SECRET
THIS
WILL
PREVENT
COMPETITORS
FROM
COMING
OUT
WITH
CLIPPERCOMPATIBLE
PHONES
WHICH
LACK
THE
GOVERNMENT
INSTALLED
BACK
DOOR
THE
STRATEGY
BRAD
DESCRIBES
WILL
ONLY
WORK
AS
LONG
AS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
GET
COMPATIBLE
PHONES
IS
TO
HAVE
ONES
WITH
THE
GOVERNMENT
CHIPS
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
PERSONAL
PRIVACY
IF
BRAD
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
RIGHT
AS
LONG
AS
PEOPLE
STILL
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
PROVIDE
THEIR
OWN
ENCRYPTION
IN
PLACE
OF
OR
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
CLIPPER
PRIVACY
IS
STILL
POSSIBLE
BUT
THE
WORDING
OF
SEVERAL
PASSAGES
IN
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
MAKES
ME
DOUBT
WHETHER
THIS
WILL
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
TRUE
