INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH
IN
DESIGNING
THE
ESCROW
WE
MAY
WANT
TO
USE
SOME
RATHER
UNUSUAL
TECHNOLOGY
SUCH
AS
SEALED
BOXES
OF
PAPER
OR
DESTRUCTIVE
READ
MEMORY
RATHER
THAN
TYPICAL
COMPUTER
DATABASES
WHICH
IS
FUN
FOR
A
DATABASE
OF
HUNDREDS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
KEYS
THE
GREATEST
DANGER
OF
THE
ESCROW
DATABASE
IF
IT
WERE
KEPT
ON
DISK
WOULD
BE
THE
CHANCE
THAT
A
COMPLETE
COPY
COULD
SOMEHOW
LEAK
OUT
YOU
CAN
DESIGN
LOTS
OF
PROTECTION
BUT
WITH
ENOUGH
CORRUPTION
A
COMPLETE
COPY
IS
ALWAYS
POSSIBLE
STORING
IT
ON
PAPER
OR
SOMETHING
VERY
HARD
TO
COPY
AT
ONCE
MAY
ACTUALLY
MAKE
SENSE
OR
A
MEDIUM
THAT
CANT
BE
COPIED
FOR
EXAMPLE
SOMETHING
WITH
VERY
SLOW
ACCESS
TIMES
OR
WHICH
LEAVES
A
DESTRUCTIVE
TRAIL
IF
IT
IS
EVEN
READ
OF
COURSE
THEN
ITS
HARD
TO
BACKUP
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
NO
BACKUP
THE
DATA
IS
NOT
THERE
WHEN
A
WARRANT
COMES
ARE
WORSE
THAN
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
A
SECRET
BACKUP
AN
AUDIT
TRAIL
THAT
REVEALS
WHEN
DATA
HAS
BEEN
ACCESS
THAT
CANT
BE
ERASED
BY
THE
HUMANS
INVOLVED
IS
ALSO
NECESSARY
