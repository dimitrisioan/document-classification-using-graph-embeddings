the

they

by
an
intruder
when
a
unix
is
freshbooted
is
io
buffers
related
to
network
traffic
i
believe
my
solution
basically
uses
that
strategy
without
requiring
me
to
reach
into
the
kernel
a
few
more
sources
are
statistics
on
your
filesystems
easily
and
quickly
obtained
and
the
output
from
the
rusage
system
call
you
can
also
exec
a
finger
to
one
or
more
favorite
heavilyused
systems
though
this
can
take
several
seconds
