CLIPPER

ANNOUNCEMENT
WRITES
THE
PRESIDENT
TODAY
ANNOUNCED
A
NEW
INITIATIVE
THAT
WILL
BRING
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TOGETHER
WITH
INDUSTRY
IN
A
VOLUNTARY
PROGRAM
TO
IMPROVE
THE
SECURITY
AND
PRIVACY
OF
TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATIONS
WHILE
MEETING
THE
LEGITIMATE
NEEDS
OF
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
A
NICE
FORMULATION
FOR
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
THE
FIRST
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
WITH
BUILTIN
TRAPDOORS
JUST
LIKE
THE
FEDS
WANTED
FOR
TOO
LONG
THERE
HAS
BEEN
LITTLE
OR
NO
DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
OUR
PRIVATE
SECTOR
AND
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
COMMUNITY
TO
RESOLVE
THE
TENSION
BETWEEN
ECONOMIC
VITALITY
AND
THE
REAL
CHALLENGES
OF
PROTECTING
AMERICANS
RATHER
THAN
USE
TECHNOLOGY
TO
ACCOMMODATE
THE
SOMETIMES
COMPETING
INTERESTS
OF
ECONOMIC
GROWTH
PRIVACY
AND
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
PREVIOUS
POLICIES
HAVE
PITTED
GOVERNMENT
AGAINST
INDUSTRY
AND
THE
RIGHTS
OF
PRIVACY
AGAINST
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
BLABLA
PROTECT
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
AND
COMPUTER
FILES
WHILE
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
CAN
HELP
AMERICANS
PROTECT
BUSINESS
SECRETS
AND
THE
UNAUTHORIZED
RELEASE
OF
PERSONAL
INFORMATION
IT
ALSO
CAN
BE
USED
BY
TERRORISTS
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
OTHER
CRIMINALS
INDEED
AND
THE
CURRENT
PROPOSAL
DOES
NOTHING
TO
PREVENT
THE
LATTER
AN
ORDINARY
TELEPHONE
IT
SCRAMBLES
TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATIONS
USING
AN
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
THAT
IS
MORE
POWERFUL
THAN
MANY
IN
COMMERCIAL
USE
TODAY
THIS
DOESNT
SAY
MUCH
THERE
ARE
MANY
INCREDIBLY
WEAK
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHMS
IN
COMMERCIAL
USE
TODAY
THIS
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
WILL
HELP
COMPANIES
PROTECT
PROPRIETARY
INFORMATION
PROTECT
THE
PRIVACY
OF
PERSONAL
PHONE
CONVERSATIONS
AND
PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED
RELEASE
OF
DATA
TRANSMITTED
ELECTRONICALLY
EXCEPT
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THIS
TECHNOLOGY
PRESERVES
THE
ABILITY
OF
FEDERAL
STATE
AND
LOCAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
TO
INTERCEPT
LAWFULLY
THE
PHONE
CONVERSATIONS
OF
CRIMINALS
NOPE
THE
CRIMINALS
WONT
BE
STUPID
ENOUGH
TO
USE
THE
NEW
CHIP
THEYLL
USE
SOMETHING
SECURE
THIS
TECHNOLOGY
PROVIDES
ONLY
MEANS
TO
INTERCEPT
THE
PHONE
CONVERSATIONS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
STUPID
ENOUGH
TO
USE
IT
AGENCIES
TO
DECODE
MESSAGES
ENCODED
BY
THE
DEVICE
WHEN
THE
DEVICE
IS
MANUFACTURED
THE
TWO
KEYS
WILL
BE
DEPOSITED
SEPARATELY
IN
TWO
KEYESCROW
DATA
BASES
THAT
WILL
BE
ESTABLISHED
BY
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
ACCESS
TO
THESE
KEYS
WILL
BE
LIMITED
TO
GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS
WITH
LEGAL
AUTHORIZATION
TO
CONDUCT
A
WIRETAP
THAT
IS
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
THE
KEYS
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
MUCH
IF
THEY
ARE
IN
ONE
OR
IN
TWO
OF
ITS
HANDS
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
TECHNOLOGY
PROVIDES
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WITH
NO
NEW
AUTHORITIES
TO
ACCESS
THE
CONTENT
OF
THE
PRIVATE
CONVERSATIONS
OF
AMERICANS
CORRECT
IT
DOES
HOWEVER
PROVIDE
THOSE
AMERICANS
WITH
THE
FALSE
SENSE
OF
PRIVACY
DEVICES
IN
ADDITION
RESPECTED
EXPERTS
FROM
OUTSIDE
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
BE
OFFERED
ACCESS
TO
THE
CONFIDENTIAL
DETAILS
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
TO
ASSESS
ITS
CAPABILITIES
AND
PUBLICLY
REPORT
THEIR
FINDINGS
IF
THE
SCREENING
IS
NOT
PUBLIC
IT
CANNOT
BE
TRUSTED
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
TRUST
DES
EVEN
TODAY
AFTER
ALL
THE
EXAMINATIONS
ONLY
BECAUSE
SOME
PARTS
OF
ITS
DESIGN
WERE
KEPT
SECRET
THE
CHIP
IS
AN
IMPORTANT
STEP
IN
ADDRESSING
THE
PROBLEM
OF
ENCRYPTIONS
DUALEDGE
SWORD
ENCRYPTION
HELPS
TO
PROTECT
THE
PRIVACY
OF
INDIVIDUALS
AND
INDUSTRY
BUT
IT
ALSO
CAN
SHIELD
CRIMINALS
AND
TERRORISTS
WE
NEED
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
OTHER
APPROACHES
THAT
CAN
BOTH
PROVIDE
LAWABIDING
CITIZENS
WITH
ACCESS
TO
THE
ENCRYPTION
THEY
NEED
AND
PREVENT
CRIMINALS
FROM
USING
IT
TO
HIDE
THEIR
ILLEGAL
ACTIVITIES
IN
ORDER
TO
ASSESS
TECHNOLOGY
SO
THEYLL
USE
A
DIFFERENT
TECHNOLOGY
TO
HIDE
THEIR
ILLEGAL
ACTIVITIES
SO
WILL
THOSE
LAWABIDING
CITIZENS
WHO
DO
NOT
TRUST
THEIR
GOVERNMENT
NOT
TO
MISUSE
ITS
ABILITIES
TO
DECRYPT
THEIR
CONVERSATIONS
THE
PRIVACY
OF
OUR
CITIZENS
INCLUDING
THE
NEED
TO
EMPLOY
VOICE
OR
DATA
ENCRYPTION
FOR
BUSINESS
PURPOSES
EXCEPT
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
THE
NEED
OF
US
COMPANIES
TO
MANUFACTURE
AND
EXPORT
HIGH
TECHNOLOGY
PRODUCTS
HUH
LATER
IT
SAYS
THAT
THE
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
WILL
BE
EXPORT
RESTRICTED
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
WILL
PLAY
AN
INCREASINGLY
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
THAT
INFRASTRUCTURE
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
MUST
ACT
QUICKLY
TO
DEVELOP
CONSISTENT
COMPREHENSIVE
POLICIES
REGARDING
ITS
USE
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
COMMITTED
TO
POLICIES
THAT
PROTECT
ALL
AMERICANS
RIGHT
TO
PRIVACY
WHILE
ALSO
PROTECTING
THEM
FROM
THOSE
WHO
BREAK
THE
LAW
IN
SHORT
THE
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
CAN
PROTECT
THE
LAW
ABIDING
CITIZENS
PRIVACY
FROM
THE
CASUAL
SNOOPER
IT
CANNOT
PROTECT
HIM
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
IF
IT
DECIDES
TO
MISUSE
ITS
ABILITY
TO
DECRYPT
THE
CONVERSATIONS
PROTECT
HIM
FROM
THE
CRIMINALS
WHO
SUCCEED
TO
BREAK
THE
NEW
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
OR
TO
STEAL
THE
KEYS
OR
TO
BRIBE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HANDLE
THEM
ETC
PREVENT
THE
CRIMINALS
FROM
USING
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
FOR
COMMUNICATION
Q
DOES
THIS
APPROACH
EXPAND
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
TO
LISTEN
IN
ON
PHONE
CONVERSATIONS
A
NO
CLIPPER
CHIP
TECHNOLOGY
PROVIDES
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WITH
NO
NEW
AUTHORITIES
TO
ACCESS
THE
CONTENT
OF
THE
PRIVATE
CONVERSATIONS
OF
AMERICANS
CORRECT
HOWEVER
IT
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
THEM
THAT
MUCH
PRIVACY
AS
IT
CLAIMS
Q
WHO
WILL
RUN
THE
KEYESCROW
DATA
BANKS
A
THE
TWO
KEYESCROW
DATA
BANKS
WILL
BE
RUN
BY
TWO
INDEPENDENT
ENTITIES
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
DEPARTMENT
OF
JUSTICE
AND
THE
ADMINISTRATION
HAVE
YET
TO
DETERMINE
WHICH
AGENCIES
WILL
OVERSEE
THE
KEYESCROW
DATA
BANKS
TWO
CANDIDATES
THE
NSA
AND
THE
MAFIA
Q
HOW
STRONG
IS
THE
SECURITY
IN
THE

HOW
CAN
I
BE
SURE
HOW
STRONG
THE
SECURITY
IS
A
THIS
SYSTEM
IS
MORE
SECURE
THAN
MANY
OTHER
VOICE
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEMS
READILY
AVAILABLE
TODAY
THAT
IS
TRUST
US
WHILE
THE
ALGORITHM
WILL
REMAIN
CLASSIFIED
TO
PROTECT
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
KEY
ESCROW
SECURITY
THROUGH
OBSCURITY
SYSTEM
WE
ARE
WILLING
TO
INVITE
AN
INDEPENDENT
PANEL
OF
CRYPTOGRAPHY
EXPERTS
TO
EVALUATE
THE
ALGORITHM
TO
ASSURE
ALL
POTENTIAL
USERS
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
UNRECOGNIZED
VULNERABILITIES
IF
ITS
NOT
ENTIRELY
OPEN
TO
PUBLIC
EXAMINATION
IT
CANNOT
BE
TRUSTED
BESIDES
WHO
CAN
PROVE
THAT
THE
DEVICES
USED
FOR
EXAMINATION
AND
THE
ONES
BUILT
INTO
YOUR
PHONES
WILL
BE
THE
SAME
Q
WHOSE
DECISION
WAS
IT
TO
PROPOSE
THIS
PRODUCT
A
THE
NATIONAL
SECURITY
COUNCIL
THE
JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT
THE
THE
NSA
AND
THE
FBI
Q
WHO
WAS
CONSULTED
THE
CONGRESS
INDUSTRY
A
WE
HAVE
ONGOING
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
CONGRESS
AND
INDUSTRY
ON
ENCRYPTION
ISSUES
AND
EXPECT
THOSE
DISCUSSIONS
TO
INTENSIFY
AS
WE
CARRY
OUT
OUR
REVIEW
OF
ENCRYPTION
POLICY
WE
HAVE
BRIEFED
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS
AND
INDUSTRY
LEADERS
ON
THE
DECISIONS
RELATED
TO
THIS
INITIATIVE
WHY
DID
THEY
FORGET
THE
ACADEMIA
Q
WILL
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROVIDE
THE
HARDWARE
TO
MANUFACTURERS
A
THE
GOVERNMENT
DESIGNED
AND
DEVELOPED
THE
KEY
ACCESS
ENCRYPTION
MICROCIRCUITS
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
PROVIDING
THE
MICROCIRCUITS
TO
PRODUCT
MANUFACTURERS
PRODUCT
MANUFACTURERS
CAN
ACQUIRE
THE
MICROCIRCUITS
FROM
THE
CHIP
MANUFACTURER
THAT
PRODUCES
THEM
DOESNT
THIS
SMELL
TO
MONOPOLISM
Q
WHO
PROVIDES
THE

A
MYKOTRONX
PROGRAMS
IT
AT
THEIR
FACILITY
IN
TORRANCE
CALIFORNIA
AND
WILL
SELL
THE
CHIP
TO
ENCRYPTION
DEVICE
MANUFACTURERS
THE
PROGRAMMING
FUNCTION
COULD
BE
LICENSED
TO
OTHER
VENDORS
IN
THE
FUTURE
LIKE
THE
MAFIA
Q
IF
THE
ADMINISTRATION
WERE
UNABLE
TO
FIND
A
TECHNOLOGICAL
SOLUTION
LIKE
THE
ONE
PROPOSED
WOULD
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BE
WILLING
TO
USE
LEGAL
REMEDIES
TO
RESTRICT
ACCESS
TO
MORE
POWERFUL
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
THIS
IS
THE
MAIN
QUESTION
WHY
WAS
IT
BURIED
AT
THE
END
A
THIS
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
POLICY
QUESTION
WHICH
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED
DURING
THE
BROAD
POLICY
REVIEW
THE
KEY
ESCROW
WELL
SEE
MECHANISM
WILL
PROVIDE
AMERICANS
WITH
AN
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THAT
IS
MORE
SECURE
MORE
CONVENIENT
AND
LESS
EXPENSIVE
THAN
OTHERS
READILY
AVAILABLE
TODAY
BUT
IT
IS
JUST
ONE
TRUST
US
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
NOT
SAYING
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
THREATENS
THE
PUBLIC
SAFETY
AND
EFFECTIVE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WE
WILL
PROHIBIT
IT
OUTRIGHT
AS
SOME
COUNTRIES
HAVE
IN
SHORT
IF
WE
DECIDE
TO
OUTLAW
STRONG
CRYPTO
WELL
TELL
YOU
EFFECTIVELY
DONE
NOR
IS
THE
US
SAYING
THAT
EVERY
AMERICAN
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
IS
ENTITLED
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THERE
IS
A
SINCE
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
SEEMS
TO
CONSIDER
STRONG
CRYPTO
AS
MUNITIONS
AND
SINCE
THE
US
CONSTITUTIONS
GUARANTEES
THE
RIGHT
TO
EVERY
AMERICAN
TO
BEAR

WHY
IS
NOT
EVERY
AMERICAN
ENTITLED
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
A
IT
INDICATES
THAT
WE
UNDERSTAND
THE

OF

TECHNOLOGY
IN

AND

AND
ARE
COMMITTED
TO
WORKING
WITH

THAT
