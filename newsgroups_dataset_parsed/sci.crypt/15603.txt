THEY

HAVE
TO

NORMALLY
A

ORDER
TO
DO
THE

IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THEY
WOULD
THEN
PRESENT

OF
THIS
AUTHORIZATION
TO
THE
TWO
ENTITIES
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
SAFEGUARDING
THE
KEYS
AND
OBTAIN
THE
KEYS
FOR
THE

BEING
USED
BY
THE

SMUGGLERS
THE

IS
SPLIT
INTO
TWO
PARTS

ARE
STORED

THE

THE

ENFORCER
ARMED

ATTACHES

TO

WITH

REMEMBER
THESE
ARE
THE
FOLK
WHO
COULDNT
COPE
WITH

AND

A

WE
ARE
TALKING
ANALOGUE

HERE
WHAT
NEXT
WHAT
MODULATION
SCHEME
DO
THESE
CLIPPER
BOXES
USE
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
RECORD
THE
TONES
FOR
USE
AFTER
THE
KEYS
ARE
OBTAINED
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
QUITE
DIFFICULT
TO
RECORD
A
MODEM
SESSION
AT
SOME
INTERMEDIATE
POINT
ON
THE
LINE
MAYBE
THEY
HAVE
TAKEN
A
CRASH
COURSE
IN
DATA
COMMS
AND
HAVE
A
UNIT
THAT
DEMODULATES
THE
TONES
AND
STORES
THE
DIGITAL
STREAM
FOR
DECRYPTION
LATER
THIS
WOULD
STILL
SUFFER
FROM
THE
SAME
PROBLEMS
AS
TRYING
TO
RECORD
THE
TONES
AS
THE
DEMODULATOR
WOULD
NOT
BE
AT
ONE
END
OF
THE
LINE
IF
CALLS
CANT
BE
RECORDED
FOR
DECRYPTION
LATER
IT
WOULD
BE
QUITE
EASY
TO
FOIL
THE
SYSTEM
BY
BUYING
LOTS
OF
CLIPPER
UNITS
THESE
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
CHEAP
MASS
MARKET
ITEMS
AND
USING
THEM
IN
TURN
HOW
TOLERANT
IS
THE
MODULATION
SCHEME
TO
ERRORS
THESE
THINGS
ARE
PROPOSED
FOR
USE
BY
US
CORPORATIONS
TO
SECURE
THEIR
FOREIGN
OFFICES
WHERE
PHONE
LINE
QUALITY
MAY
WELL
BE
POOR
IT
SEEMS
HARD
ENOUGH
TO
ME
TO
GET
DIGITISED
SPEECH
OF
ANY
QUALITY
INTO
SOMETHING
A
MODEM
CAN
HANDLE
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
ADD
LOTS
OF
ERROR
CORRECTION
TO
KEEP
THE
DECRYPTION
IN
SYNC
Q
WILL
THE
DEVICES
BE
EXPORTABLE
WILL
OTHER
DEVICES
THAT
USE
THE
GOVERNMENT
HARDWARE
A
VOICE
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
ARE
SUBJECT
TO
EXPORT
CONTROL
REQUIREMENTS
ONE
OF
THE
ATTRACTIONS
OF
THIS
TECHNOLOGY
IS
THE
PROTECTION
IT
CAN
GIVE
TO
US
COMPANIES
OPERATING
AT
HOME
AND
ABROAD
WITH
THIS
IN
MIND
WE
EXPECT
EXPORT
LICENSES
WILL
BE
GRANTED
ON
A
CASEBYCASE
BASIS
FOR
US
COMPANIES
SEEKING
TO
USE
THESE
DEVICES
TO
SECURE
THEIR
OWN
COMMUNICATIONS
ABROAD
THIS
RAISES
AN
INTERSTING
QUESTION
IN
THE
UK
HERE
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
TO
CONNECT
ANYTHING
TO
A
PUBLIC
TELECOMMS
NETWORK
WITHOUT
IT
BEING
APPROVED
BY
A
BODY
CALLED
BABT
IT
HAS
BEEN
STATED
EITHER
HERE
OR
IN
THE
UKTELECOM
GROUP
THAT
THEY
WILL
NOT
APPROVE
EQUIPMENT
THAT
DOES
ENCRYPTION
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
OR
NOT
BUT
THIS
WOULD
MAKE
A
GOOD
TEST
CASE
PERHAPS
FRIENDLY
COUNTRIES
AND
THE

MAY
STILL
