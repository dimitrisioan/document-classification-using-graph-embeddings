re
the
clipper
chip
a
technical
summary
in
article
denningguvaxaccgeorgetownedu
writes
the
following
document
summarizes
the
clipper
chip
how
it
is
used
how
programming
of
the
chip
is
coupled
to
key
generation
and
the
escrow
process
and
how
law
enforcement
decrypts
communications
interesting
tell
us
what
happens
if
i
were
to
say
ok
i
want
to
have
something
else
if
the
law
enforcement
wants
my
traffic
they
can
record
it
then
get
a
search
warrant
and
get
the
keys
from
me
just
like
they
would
the
keys
to
a
stout
private
safe
etc
lets
say
i
suspect
that
there
is
a
way
to
trivially
crack
this
at
the
fed
level
with
no
warrant
say
for
nsa
scanning
for
keywords
etc
and
the
government
has
abused
great
power
in
the
past
so
i
say
mr
vendor
i
want
something
different
independent
i
am
a
paranoid
sort
ya
understand
will
the
result
be
sorry
without
government
permission
we
cannot
sell
you
anything
secure
or
would
it
be
sorry
we
know
which
side
our
bread
is
buttered
on
we
cannot
sell
except
to
government
people
law
enforcement
and
special
people
what
in
your
opinion
would
be
the
chances
of
sure
we
will
sell
you
this
secure
system
be
happy
to
also
please
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
us
what
the
plans
are
for
private
encryption
of
say
files
transferred
by
modem
or
ftp
or
data
stored
on
disk
surely
you
have
a
feel
for
what
the
administration
is
planning
for
us
people
on
that
with
your
rather
intimate
relationship
with
the
fbi
nsa
etc
you
must
certainly
have
an
idea
you
are
surely
not
going
to
say
the
people
are
not
to
know
until
it
is
too
late
this
is
supposed
to
be
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
isnt
it
that
is
the
people
are
the
governments
bosses
the
bosses
want
to
know
what
the
is
going
on
here
you
see
i
am
kind
of
nervous
because
in
the
last
month
or
so
i
have
seen
a
nonstop
stream
of
ideas
coming
out
of
wash
dc
that
at
least
appear
very
strongly
to
have
a
common
trait
to
limit
privacy
freedom
from
govt
eavesdropping
and
the
ability
to
defend
ourselves
against
violent
attack
no
is
not
good
enough
for
common
folk
they
arrive
only
in
time
to
clean
up
the
mess
i
would
be
dead
if
i
had
to
depend
on
you
see
with
all
that
talk
about
national
smart
id
cards
limiting
of
encryption
to
government
approved
denial
of
means
to
effective
personal
defense
eight
bills
in
congress
right
now
it
looks
an
awfully
lot
like
the
whole
thing
is
to
be
able
to
trace
every
activity
of
an
individual
from
cradle
to
grave
all
it
would
take
is
requiring
that
national
id
card
to
be
used
in
all
transactions
and
with
no
effective
data
protection
and
with
the
people
suitably
disarmed
there
would
not
be
a
helluva
lot
they
could
do
about
it
now
would
there
all
in
the
name
of
the
war
on
the
constitu
er
drugs
and
of
course
that
catch
word
terrorists
what
is
wrong
with
good
oldfashioned
police
work
to
build
a
case
they
dont
want
to
have
to
be
burdened
to
leave
the
office
it
seems
please
read
the
bill
of
rights
first
ten
amendments
to
the
us
constitution
and
tell
us
how
you
can
reconcile
this
big
brotherish
policy
of
the
administration
always
for
a
crisis
of
some
kind
isnt
it
with
that
bill
of
rights
in
the
context
of
the
people
who
wrote
it
reassure
us
please
or
is
that
no
longer
regarded
as
necessary
seeing
as
apparantly
the
people
have
no
input
on
this
agenda
the
administration
preferring
to
make
all
the
decisions
in
secret
then
springing
it
on
us
doesnt
sound
much
like
by
the
people
to
me
i
cannot
help
notice
that
the
congress
people
involved
were
not
mentioned
on
the
press
release
i
find
that
more
than
a
little
bit
curious
dont
you
i
sure
would
like
to
know
who
to
not
vote
for
come
election
time
yes
i
am
upset
i
feel
you
are
a
part
of
this
because
i
recall
it
was
you
that
was
posting
heavily
in
favor
of
a
very
similar
idea
could
have
been
the
same
thing
it
was
so
close
a
few
months
ago
i
also
recall
it
was
not
well
received
apparantly
powersthatbe
really
didnt
care
or
were
not
told
or
both
from
what
i
see
clipper
will
only
be
useful
for
conversations
i
dont
want
the
neighborhood
kid
listening
in
on
any
serious
security
i
dont
think
i
would
want
to
trust
it
a
bit
might
as
well
use
cleartext
certainly
corporations
would
be
rather
dumb
to
depend
on
this
for
serious
tradesecret
data
especially
if
millions
depended
on
that
security
given
enough
money
one
could
buy
any
keys
they
wanted
buy
a
crooked
judge
and
a
crooked
cop
given
a
few
hundred
thou
they
wouldnt
be
hard
to
find
so
we
end
up
with
only
criminals
terrorists
and
the
government
with
real
security
and
the
ability
to
eavesdrop
you
know
the
first
two
if
they
are
serious
aint
going
to
use
this
thing
for
their
communications
i
bet
the
government
wont
either
except
perhaps
to
order
a
pizza
tell
us
will
that
be
prima
face
evidence
of
criminal
activity
someone
not
using
the
government
approved
methods
that
just
a
desire
to
have
privacy
is
no
longer
regarded
as
a
legitimate
right
of
an
unconnected
citizen
will
that
be
grounds
for
a
flythroughthedoor
raid
and
confiscation
of
all
ones
equipment
as
terrorist
tools
using
civil
forfeiture
so
there
will
be
no
inconvenient
need
to
prove
any
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
citizen
i
have
yet
another
question
are
we
going
to
see
articles
in
all
the
public
magazines
consisting
of
soothing
text
telling
us
how
great
this
is
how
nice
the
government
is
by
letting
us
have
this
illusion
of
privacy
that
the
government
is
going
to
be
so
kind
as
to
let
us
sort
of
exercise
a
right
what
you
want
to
bet
that
i
am
correct
here
please
answer
these
questions
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
we
hava
a
right
to
know
what
our
government
plans
to
let
us
have
out
of
the
goodness
of
their
hearts
funny
thing
though
with
all
these
proposals
i
dont
feel
one
bit
safer
from
drug
dealers
terrorists
or
a
common
street
thug
i
am
beginning
to
wonder
if
the
greater
danger
lies
in
the
above
entities
or
our
own
government
gone
out
of
control
reassure
us
please
so
far
i
havent
seen
much
to
reassure
me
and
a
lot
to
greatly
disturb
me
