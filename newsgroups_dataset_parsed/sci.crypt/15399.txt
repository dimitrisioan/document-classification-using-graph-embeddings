DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WRITES
THOUGH
SOME
MAY
ARGUE
ABOUT
THE
NOSE
OF
THE
CAMEL
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROPOSAL
IS
LIMITED
TO
SCRAMBLED
TELEPHONY
IF
IT
IS
ONLY
USED
FOR
THAT
PURPOSE
AND
DOES
NOT
EXTEND
TO
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
OR
FILE
AS
USUAL
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
IS
DEMONSTRATING
HIS
INABILITY
TO
READ
THE
PROPOSAL
CLEARLY
STATES
THE
INITIATIVE
WILL
INVOLVE
THE
CREATION
OF
NEW
PRODUCTS
TO
ACCELERATE
THE
DEVELOPMENT
AND
USE
OF
ADVANCED
AND
SECURE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
NETWORKS
AND
WIRELESS
COMMUNICATIONS
LINKS
IT
SPEAKS
ABOUT
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
IN
GENERAL
READ
IT
AGAIN
DAVID
MAYBE
YOULL
UNDERSTAND
IT
THE
NEXT
TIME
NAH
PROBABLY
NOT
ENCRYPTION
THEN
IT
IS
AN
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THE
CURRENT
MASSPRODUCED
STANDARD
CIVILIAN
TECHNOLOGY
WHICH
WITH
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONS
IS
LIMITED
TO
EASYTOBREAK
INVERTERS
THATS
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WANTS
ALL
SHEEPMINDED
PEOPLE
TO
THINK
LETS
LOOK
AT
THE
CURRENT
SITUATION
IT
ALLOWS
TO
ALMOST
ANYBODY
TO
EAVESDROP
ALMOST
EVERYBODY
UNLESS
SECURE
AND
I
MEAN
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
IS
USED
WHAT
WILL
HAPPEN
WHEN
IF
HA
OPTIMISTS
THE
NEW
PROPOSAL
GETS
ACCEPTED
ALMOST
NOBODY
EXCEPT
SOME
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
EAVESDROP
EVERYBODY
ELSE
BUT
THE
ABILITY
OF
THESE
SOME
TO
EAVESDROP
WILL
BE
GUARANTEED
THE
PROPOSAL
EMPHASIZES
ON
THE
FORMER
ALMOST
NOBODY
WHICH
IS
CLEARLY
AN
IMPROVEMENT
AND
FORGETS
TO
MENTION
THE
DRAWBACKS
OF
THE
LATTER
GUARANTEED
YES
MY
STATEMENT
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
NEXT
STEP
WILL
BE
TO
MAKE
THE
STRONG
CRYPTO
UNLAWFUL
YOU
THINK
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
GOOD
LUCK
NOTE
THAT
THE
BIG
ISSUE
FOR
THE
FEDS
IS
THE
CONTINUED
ABILITY
TO
WIRETAP
ITS
NOT
JUST
CONTINUED
ABILITY
ITS
GUARANTEED
ABILITY
BEFORE
WE
GO
OFF
THE
DEEP
END
WITH
LONG
DISCUSIONS
ABOUT
SECURE
CRYPTO
FOR
EMAIL
AND
FILES
LETS
FOCUS
ON
THIS
YEAH
THATS
EXACTLY
WHAT
YOUR
GOVERNMENT
WANTS
YOU
TO
THINK
LETS
TAKE
SMALL
STEPS
ONE
AT
A
TIME
CONCENTRATE
ON
THE
CURRENT
ONE
DONT
THINK
ABOUT
THE
FUTURE
TRUST
US
ONE
QUESTION
THAT
WAS
NOT
ASKED
IN
THE
RELEASE
IS
WHETHER
THIS
PROPOSAL
IS
LIMITED
TO
TELEPHONY
OR
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
INTENDS
TO
EXPAND
IT
ITS
NOT
ASKED
BECAUSE
THE
PROPOSAL
CLEARLY
SAYS
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
INTENTION
THEY
UNLIKE
YOU
READ
WHAT
THEY
WRITE
THOUGH
I
SHARE
MANY
OF
THE
CONCERNS
EXPRESSED
BY
SOME
I
FIND
THE
PROPOSAL
LESS
THREATENING
THAN
MANY
OTHERS
SINCE
RIGHT
NOW
MOST
AMERICANS
HAVE
NO
SECURE
TELEPHONY
AND
ANY
JERK
WITH
A
PAIR
OF
CLIP
LEADS
AND
A
GOAT
CAN
EAVESDROP
THIS
WOULD
ALSO
PLUG
UP
THE
SECURITY
HOLE
IN
CELLULAR
AND
CORDLESS
PHONES
YES
IT
WILL
IT
WILL
STOP
THE
JERK
WHO
IS
EAVESDROPPING
NOW
IT
WILL
ALLOW
ONLY
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
EAVESDROP
IF
THE
SCHEME
IS
SECURE
OF
COURSE
WHICH
IS
YET
TO
BE
PROVEN
BUT
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THE
JERK
YOU
ARE
FEARING
NOW
WILL
NOT
GET
A
GOVERNMENT
JOB
TOMORROW
THE
NEW
PROPOSAL
GUARANTEES
HIM
THE
ABILITY
TO
EAVESDROP
THEN
HELL
THAT
WILL
EVEN
MOTIVATE
HIM
TO
GET
THAT
JOB
IF
HE
INDEED
IS
THAT
MENTALLY
PERVERT
READING
BETWEEN
THE
LINES
I
INFER
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
IS
HIGHLY
SECURE
WITHOUT
ACCESS
TO
THE
KEYS
GREAT
THE
GREATEST
CRYPTOGRAPHER
OF
ALL
TIMES
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
TM
HAS
SUCCEEDED
TO
EVALUATE
THE
NEW
SYSTEM
IN
THE
ABSENSE
OF
ANY
DETAILS
WHATSOEVER
AND
HAS
CONCLUDED
THAT
IT
IS
HIGHLY
SECURE
I
GUESS
THAT
COMES
FROM
THE
BACKGROUND
OF
WORKING
SOME
YEARS
FOR
THE
TWO
MAJOR
CRYPTO
EVALUATING
COMPANIES
RIGHT
GEE
NOW
THE
GOVERNMENT
CAN
SAVE
ALL
THAT
MONEY
AND
TROUBLE
TO
ASK
A
SECRET
COUNCIL
OF
CRYPTO
EXPERTS
TO
SECRETLY
ANALYSE
THE
NEW
SECRET
METHOD
FOR
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
HAS
ALREADY
DONE
ALL
THE
JOB
FOR
THEM
THIS
WOULD
MEET
THE
NEEDS
OF
US
BUSINESSES
CONFRONTED
BY
RICH
AND
POWERFUL
ADVERSARIES
INCLUDING
FRENCH
AND
JAPANESE
SECURITY
SERVICES
AND
RICH
JAPANESE
COMPANIES
IT
ALLOWS
THE
NSA
TO
MAKE
AVAILABLE
SOME
OF
ITS
BETTER
STUFF
WHILE
PROTECTING
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
NEEDS
TRUST
US
WERE
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
WERE
HERE
TO
HELP
YOU
MOST
LEGITIMATE
US
CORPORATIONS
TRUST
THE
NSA
AND
WOULD
BE
DELIGHTED
TO
HAVE
A
HIGHSECURITY
SYSTEM
CERTIFIED
BY
THEM
EVEN
AT
THE
PRICE
OF
DEPOSITING
KEYS
IN
ESCROW
I
SEE
NO
DIFFICULTY
IN
CREATING
A
RELIABLE
THOSE
WHO
ARE
PREPARED
TO
TRADE
THEIR
LIBERTIES
FOR
THE
PROMISES
OF
FUTURE
SAFETY
DO
NOT
DESERVE
EITHER
THIS
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
EXACT
QUOTE
BUT
THE
MEANING
IS
THE
SAME
HAS
BEEN
SAID
BY
ONE
OF
YOUR
GREAT
MEN
MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
STUDY
THEIR
WORKS
MORE
CAREFULLY
IF
YOU
HAVE
THE
BRAINS
TO
UNDERSTAND
THEM
OF
COURSE
FROM
MY
POINT
OF
VIEW
THIS
IS
A
FAIR
STARTING
POINT
THERE
ARE
CONCERNS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
INCLUDING
THE
RELIABILITY
OF
THE
ESCROWS
BUT
IN
THE
MAIN
QUESTION
IS
TO
GUARANTEE
TO
AVAILABILITY
OF
REALLY
SECURE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
TO
THE
MASSES
GEE
IF
THE
PROPOSAL
WAS
SAYING
WE
GUARANTEE
THAT
EVERY
AMERICAN
WILL
STILL
HAVE
THE
FULL
RIGHT
TO
USE
ANY
KIND
OF
ENCRYPTION
SHE
WOULD
LIKE
AND
REGARD
THIS
PROPOSAL
AS
JUST
A
DEFAULT
VOLUNTARY
IMPLEMENTATION
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
LESS
OPPOSITION
FOR
SOME
REASON
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
TRY
TO
PROMISE
YOU
THAT
I
WONDER
WHY
WAS
ORWELL
OFF
ONLY
BY
YEARS
RETURN
WE
GET
ACCESS
TO
HIGHSECURITY
CRYPTO
NO
IN
RETURN
YOU
GET
CRYPTO
THAT
IS
GUARANTEED
TO
BE
CRIPPLED
MANY
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THAT
DES
AND
OTHER
SYSTEMS
MAY
BE
BREAKABLE
BY
THE
NSA
AND
HENCE
OTHERS
SIMILARLY
SKILLED
AND
ENDOWED
WHILE
THE
ABOVE
IS
JUST
RUMORS
AND
WHILE
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
TRUE
IT
IS
NOT
DONE
EASILY
THE
NEW
SCHEME
CAN
IS
GUARANTEED
TO
BE
EASILY
BREAKABLE
BY
ANYBODY
WHO
HAS
THE
TWO
KEYS
IT
MIGHT
BE
ALSO
BREAKABLE
BY
SOMEBODY
WHO
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THEM
BUT
KNOWS
THE
RIGHT
TRICK
OR
WHO
HAS
ONLY
ONE
OF
THEM
NSA
ALSO
TOLD
YOU
THAT
DES
IS
SECURE
WHY
DONT
YOU
SIMPLY
TRUST
THEM
HUH
THERE
IS
AT
LEAST
A
GOOD
POSSIBILITY
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
CHECKED
THAT
THE
PROPOSED
SYSTEM
IS
NOT
SO
BREAKABLE
IT
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
IT
IS
GUARANTEED
TO
BE
EASILY
BREAKABLE
JUST
GET
THE
KEYS
IT
MIGHT
BE
EVEN
EASIER
BUT
UNTIL
THERE
IS
SOME
EVIDENCE
THIS
IS
JUST
A
WILD
SPECULATION
BE
NOR
DOES
IT
HAVE
TO
HAVE
TRAPDOORS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
CAN
GET
THE
KEYS
THE
TRAPDOORS
ARE
THERE
IN
GOVERNMENTS
HANDS
THE
KEYS
PURSUANT
TO
A
LEGITIMATE
COURT
ORDER
THUS
THEY
CAN
PROTECT
LEGITIMATE
COMMUNICATIONS
AGAINST
ECONOMIC
ADVERSARIES
WHILE
STILL
BEING
ABLE
TO
EAVESDROP
ON
CROOKS
PURSUANT
TO
A
COURT
ORDER
LEGITIMATE
AND
WHO
DECIDES
WHAT
COMMUNICATIONS
ARE
LEGITIMATE
OH
I
GUESS
ITS
THE
GOVERNMENT
RIGHT
THE
GUYS
WHO
ALREADY
HAVE
THE
KEYS
ITS
KINDA
IF
I
HAVE
THE
KEYS
FROM
YOUR
CAR
AND
I
AM
ASKED
TO
DECIDE
WHO
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
USE
IT
LEGITIMATELY
IN
DISCUSSING
THIS
LETS
TRY
TO
AVOID
THE
NASTINESS
PERSONAL
ATTACKS
AND
NOISE
OF
SOME
PREVIOUS
THREADS
IMPOSSIBLE
SINCE
YOU
ARE
DEMONSTRATING
THE
SAME
LEVEL
OF
INCOMPETENCE
AND
IGNORANCE
AS
IN
THE
PROVIOUS
THREADS
THIS
IS
A
SUBSTANTIVE
AND
TECHNICAL
ISSUE
AND
PERSONAL
REMARKS
HAVE
NO
PLACE
IN
SUCH
A

UNFORTUNATELY
I
