HOW
TO
MAKE
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
WIRETAPPING
LESS
BAD
WHAT
IS
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
PUSH
ON
CLIPPER
TWO
DAYS
AFTER
THE
LEAD
STORY
HERE
IN
THE
MERCURY
TIMES
MURKY
NEWS
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
ARTICLE
ON
INDUSTRIAL
ESPIONAGE
BY
THE
FRENCH
SOMEONE
HAD
SAID
WHAT
CAN
IT
HURT
TO
ALLOW
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
HAVE
CONTINUED
ACCESS
TO
OUR
COMMUNICATIONS
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
IT
THE
PROBLEM

HAVE
ACCESS
AND
PROBABLY
MORE

REALIZE
THE
GOVERNMENT
WANTS
EXCLUSIVE
ACCESS
TO
COMMUNICATIONS
INTERCEPT
HERE
IN
THE
UNITED

CUTTING
OUT
OTHER
ACCESS
DETRIMENTAL
TO
THE
NATIONAL

ALSO
DOUBT
THAT
A
LETTER
AGENCY
THAT
ORIGINATED
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
AND
THE
CHIP
DESIGNS
NEEDS
TO
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
ESCROW
SYSTEM
TO
CONTINUE
THEIR
INTERCEPT
EFFORT
BETTER
YET
WHO
OWNS
THE
COMPANY
DOING
THE
PROGRAMMING
