who

scheme
that
for
say
could
by
cracked
one
time
in
a
hundred
des
for
all
the
complaints
about
a
key
would
probably
cost
several
million
dollars
to
build
a
keysearch
machine
for
i
can
buy
a
des
keysearch
machine
off
the
shelf
now
for
approx
but
it
is
not
sold
by
that
name
go
buy
a
circuit
emulation
machine
eg
quickturn
containing
a
bunch
of
fpgas
say
to
and
program
each
to
be
a
des
search
engine
lets
say
chips
running
at
testssec
time
is

max
weeks
weeks
average
cant
wait
that
long
buy
a
bigger
machine
oh
but
can
big
brother
afford
such
things
in
these
times
of
tight
budgets
i
dont
know
how
many
folks
noticed
it
but
dorothy
trust
me
denning
gave
a
real
clue
to
the
current
state
of
the
art
at
nsa
on
decrypto
machines
when
she
said
the
nsa
told
her
they
didnt
even
want
to
be
the
holder
of
any
part
of
the
key
now
why
is
that
i
doubt
there
is
a
trapdoor
in
skipjack
but
we
will
never
know
and
i
doubt
the
nsa
would
promote
a
mass
market
chip
they
couldnt
compromise
ergo
nsa
is
now
capable
of
compromising
probably
with
brute
force
keysearch
engines
of
the
complexity
of
skipjack
look
at
the
specs
why
i
bet
they
have
thousands
of
little
chips
chugging
away
in
their
crypto
busters
maybe
even
tens
of
thousands
complexity
not
much
more
than
a
how
many
such
machines
will
fit
into
fort
meade
