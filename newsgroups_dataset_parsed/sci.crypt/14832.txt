IT

OBVIOUSLY
MANY
OF

EVEN
A

IMPRACTICAL
BARRING

BREAKING
DES
WOULD
ALLOW
AN

TO

ANY

IT

AND
THUS
COULD
CONCEIVABLY
BE

BY

BUT
FEW
AGENCIES
HAVE
SUCH
MONEY
TO
DEVOTE

STEALING
YOUR

WOULD
ALLOW
THE

BENEFITS
AS
BREAKING

TO
SAFEGUARD
IT
IT
IS
ENCRYPTED
WITH
A
DES
KEY
WHICH
IS
DERIVED
FROM
A
PASSPHRASE
YOU
TYPE
IN
HOWEVER
IF
AN
ATTACKER
CAN
GET
A
COPY
OF
YOUR
PRIVATE
KEYFILE
AND
YOUR
PASSPHRASE
BY
SNOOPING
NETWORK
PACKETS
TAPPING
LINES
OR
WHATEVER
HE
COULD
BREAK
THE
WHOLE
SCHEME
THE
MAIN
RISK
IS
THAT
OF
TRANSFERRING
EITHER
THE
PASSPHRASE
OR
THE
PRIVATE
KEY
FILE
ACROSS
AN
UNTRUSTED
LINK
SO
DONT
DO
THAT
RUN
RIPEM
ON
A
TRUSTED
MACHINE
PREFERABLY
ONE
SITTING
RIGHT
IN
FRONT
OF
YOU
IDEALLY
YOUR
OWN
MACHINE
IN
YOUR
OWN
HOME
OR
MAYBE
OFFICE
WHICH
NOBODY
ELSE
HAS
PHYSICAL
ACCESS
TO
FOOLING
YOU
INTO
ACCEPTING
A
BOGUS
PUBLIC
KEY
FOR
SOMEONE
ELSE
COULD
ALLOW
AN
OPPONENT
TO
DECEIVE
YOU
INTO
SENDING
SECRET
MESSAGES
TO
HIM
RATHER
THAN
TO
THE
REAL
RECIPIENT
IF
THE
ENEMY
CAN
FOOL
YOUR
INTENDED
RECIPIENT
AS
WELL
HE
COULD
REENCRYPT
THE
MESSAGES
WITH
THE
OTHER
BOGUS
PUBLIC
KEY
AND
PASS
THEM
ALONG
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
GET
THE
PROPER
PUBLIC
KEYS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
THE
MOST
COMMON
MECHANISM
FOR
THIS
IS
FINGER
ASSUMING
THE
OPPONENT
HAS
NOT
COMPROMISED
ROUTERS
OR
DAEMONS
OR
SUCH
FINGER
CAN
BE
GIVEN
A
FAIR
AMOUNT
OF
TRUST
THE
STRONGEST
METHOD
OF
KEY
AUTHENTICATION
IS
TO
EXCHANGE
KEYS
IN
PERSON
HOWEVER
THIS
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
PRACTICAL
HAVING
OTHER
PEOPLE
VOUCH
FOR
YOU
BY
SIGNING
A
STATEMENT
CONTAINING
YOUR
KEY
IS
POSSIBLE
ALTHOUGH
RIPEM
DOESNT
HAVE
FEATURES
FOR
DOING
THIS
AS
AUTOMATICALLY
AS
PGP
RIPEM
DOES
GENERATE
AND
CHECK
FINGERPRINTS
OF
PUBLIC
KEYS
IN
THE
KEY
FILES
THEY
MAY
BE
EXCHANGED
VIA
A
SEPARATE
CHANNEL
FOR
AUTHENTICATION
PLAYBACK
ATTACKS
EVEN
IF
AN
OPPONENT
CANNOT
BREAK
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AN
OPPONENT
COULD
STILL
CAUSE
DIFFICULTIES
FOR
EXAMPLE
SUPPOSE
YOU
SEND
A
MESSAGE
WITH
MICONLY
A
PEM
MODE
WHICH
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
DISCLOSURE
PROTECTION
TO
ALICE
WHICH
SAYS
OK
LETS
DO
THAT
YOUR
OPPONENT
INTERCEPTS
IT
AND
NOW
RESENDS
IT
TO
BOB
WHO
NOW
HAS
A
MESSAGE
WHICH
IS
AUTHENTICATED
AS
FROM
YOU
TELLING
HIM
TO
DO
THAT
OF
COURSE
HE
MAY
INTERPRET
IT
IN
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
CONTEXT
OR
YOUR
OPPONENT
COULD
TRANSMIT
THE
SAME
MESSAGE
TO
THE
SAME
RECIPIENT
MUCH
LATER
FIGURING
IT
WOULD
BE
SEEN
DIFFERENTLY
AT
A
LATER
TIME
OR
THE
OPPONENT
COULD
CHANGE
THE
ORIGINATORNAME
TO
HIMSELF
REGISTER
YOUR
PUBLIC
KEY
AS
HIS
AND
SEND
A
MESSAGE
HOPING
THE
RECIPIENT
WILL
SEND
HIM
RETURN
MAIL
INDICATING
PERHAPS
EVEN
QUOTING
THE
UNKNOWN
MESSAGE
TO
DEFEAT
PLAYBACK
ATTACKS
THE
PLAINTEXT
OF
EACH
MESSAGE
SHOULD
INCLUDE
SOME
INDICATION
OF
THE
SENDER
AND
RECIPIENT
AND
A
UNIQUE
IDENTIFIER
TYPICALLY
THE
DATE
A
GOOD
FRONTEND
SCRIPT
FOR
RIPEM
SHOULD
DO
THIS
AUTOMATICALLY
IMHO
AS
A
RECIPIENT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
SURE
THAT
THE
ORIGINATORNAME
HEADER
AND
THE
SENDER
INDICATED
WITHIN
THE
PLAINTEXT
ARE
THE
SAME
THAT
YOU
REALLY
ARE
A
RECIPIENT
AND
THAT
THE
MESSAGE
IS
NOT
AN
OLD
ONE
SOME
THIS
ALSO
CAN
AND
SHOULD
BE
AUTOMATED
THE
AUTHOR
OF
THIS
FAQ
HAS
MADE
A
MODEST
ATTEMPT
AT
AUTOMATING
THE
PROCESS
OF
GENERATING
AND
CHECKING
ENCAPSULATED
HEADERS
THE
PROGRAMS
ARE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
STANDARD
DISTRIBUTION
IN
THE
UTILS
DIRECTORY
LOCAL
ATTACKS
CLEARLY
THE
SECURITY
OF
RIPEM
CANNOT
BE
GREATER
THAN
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
MACHINE
WHERE
THE
ENCRYPTION
IS
PERFORMED
FOR
EXAMPLE
UNDER
UNIX
A
SUPERUSER
COULD
MANAGE
TO
GET
AT
YOUR
ENCRYPTED
MAIL
ALTHOUGH
IT
WOULD
TAKE
SOME
PLANNING
AND
EFFORT
TO
DO
SOMETHING
LIKE
REPLACE
THE
RIPEM
EXECUTABLE
WITH
A
TROJAN
HORSE
OR
TO
GET
A
COPY
OF
THE
PLAINTEXT
DEPENDING
HOW
ITS
STORED
IN
ADDITION
THE
LINK
BETWEEN
YOU
AND
THE
MACHINE
RUNNING
RIPEM
IS
AN
EXTENSION
OF
THAT
IF
YOU
DECRYPT
WITH
RIPEM
ON
A
REMOTE
MACHINE
WHICH
YOU
ARE
CONNECTED
TO
VIA
NETWORK
OR
WORSE
YET
MODEM
AN
EAVESDROPPER
COULD
SEE
THE
PLAINTEXT
AND
PROBABLY
ALSO
YOUR
PASSPHRASE
RIPEM
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
EXECUTED
ON
SYSTEMS
YOU
TRUST
OBVIOUSLY
IN
THE
EXTREME
CASE
RIPEM
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
USED
ON
YOUR
OWN
MACHINE
WHICH
YOU
HAVE
TOTAL
CONTROL
OVER
AND
WHICH
NOBODY
ELSE
HAS
ACCESS
TO
WHICH
HAS
ONLY
CAREFULLY
EXAMINED
SOFTWARE
KNOWN
TO
BE
FREE
OF
VIRUSES
AND
SO
ON
HOWEVER
THERES
A
VERY
REAL
TRADEOFF
BETWEEN
CONVENIENCE
AND
SECURITY
HERE
A
MORE
MODERATELY
CAUTIOUS
USER
MIGHT
USE
RIPEM
ON
A
UNIX
WORKSTATION
WHERE
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVE
ACCESS
EVEN
ROOT
ACCESS
BUT
INCREASE
SECURITY
BY
KEEPING
PRIVATE
KEYS
AND
THE
STATICALLY
LINKED
OF
COURSE
EXECUTABLE
ON
A
FLOPPY
DISK
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
KEEP
RIPEM
ON
A
MULTIUSER
SYSTEM
BUT
WHEN
DIALING
IN
OVER
AN
INSECURE
LINE
THEY
WILL
DOWNLOAD
THE
MESSAGE
TO
THEIR
OWN
SYSTEM
AND
PERFORM
THE
RIPEM
DECRYPTION
THERE
HOWEVER
THE
SECURITY
PROVIDED
BY
SUCH
A
MECHANISM
IS
SOMEWHAT
ILLUSORY
SINCE
YOU
PRESUMABLY
TYPE
YOUR
CLEARTEXT
PASSWORD
TO
LOG
IN
YOUVE
JUST
GIVEN
AWAY
THE
STORE
SINCE
THE
ATTACKER
CAN
NOW
LOG
IN
AS
YOU
AND
INSTALL
TRAPS
IN
YOUR
ACCOUNT
TO
STEAL
YOUR
PRIVATE
KEY
NEXT
TIME
YOU
USE
IT
FROM
A
LESS
INSECURE
LINE
THIS
WILL
LIKELY
REMAIN
THE
SITUATION
AS
LONG
AS
MOST
SYSTEMS
USE
THE
RATHER
QUAINT
MECHANISM
OF
CLEARTEXT
PASSWORD
AUTHENTICATION
I
FIND
IT
NICE
TO
PUT
A
BRIEF
STATEMENT
OF
HOW
CAREFULLY
I
MANAGE
MY
SECURITY
ARRANGEMENT
IN
MY
PLAN
NEXT
TO
MY
PUBLIC
KEY
SO
THAT
POTENTIAL
CORRESPONDENTS
CAN
BE
AWARE
WHAT
LEVEL
OF
PRECAUTIONS
ARE
IN
PLACE
SOME
PEOPLE
USE
TWO
KEYS
A
SHORT
ONE
WHICH
IS
NOT
CAREFULLY
MANAGED
FOR
ORDINARY
USE
AND
A
LONGER
ONE
WHICH
IS
TREATED
WITH
GREATER
CARE
FOR
CRITICAL
CORRESPONDENCE
UNTRUSTED
PARTNER
ATTACKS
RIPEMS
ENCRYPTION
WILL
ENSURE
THAT
ONLY
A
PERSON
WITH
THE
PRIVATE
KEY
CORRESPONDING
TO
THE
PUBLIC
KEY
USED
TO
ENCRYPT
THE
DATA
MAY
READ
THE
TRAFFIC
HOWEVER
ONCE
SOMEONE
WITH
THAT
KEY
GETS
THE
MESSAGE
SHE
MAY
ALWAYS
MAKE
WHATEVER
KIND
OF
TRANSFORMATIONS
SHE
WISHES
THERE
EXIST
NO
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
BARRIERS
TO
A
RECIPIENT
SAY
TAKING
AN
ENCRYPTED
MESSAGE
AND
CONVERTING
IT
TO
A
MICONLY
MESSAGE
SIGNED
BY
YOU
AND
READABLE
BY
ANYONE
ALTHOUGH
RIPEM
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
THIS
FUNCTIONALITY
INDEED
THE
LATEST
PEM
DRAFT
I
HAVE
SEEN
SPECIFICALLY
STATES
THAT
SUCH
TRANSFORMATIONS
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
ALLOW
FORWARDING
FUNCTIONS
TO
WORK
INCLUDING
THE
RECIPIENTS
IN
THE
PLAINTEXT
AS
MENTIONED
ABOVE
WILL
MAKE
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
RECIPIENTS
OF
A
REDISTRIBUTED
MESSAGE
TO
BE
AWARE
OF
ITS
ORIGINAL
NATURE
NATURALLY
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
CAN
NEVER
BE
GREATER
THAN
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
USING
IT
