finally
because
there
is
essentially
no
possibility
of
intercepting
in
realtime
the
scrutable
content
of
communications
between
stolen
instruments
there
will
exist
strong
motivation
to
record
and
archive
all
communications
in
the
network
for
expostfacto
scrutiny
once
some
criminal
act
is
discovered
and
the
instruments
involved
have
been
identified
it
seems
likely
to
me
that
that
a
large
subset
of
encrypted
communications
would
be
archived
to
tape
so
they
could
be
read
if
sometime
in
the
future
probable
cause
arises
and
a
warrant
is
obtained
i
can
even
imagine
this
being
found
legal
and
constitutional
since
nothing
is
actually
listened
to
until
a
valid
warrant
is
issued
and
the
keys
are
obtained
imagine
archiving
all
payphone
conversations
so
if
someone
turns
out
to
be
a
drug
dealer
you
can
listen
to
all
their
past
drug
deals
and
archive
calls
tofrom
suspected
mafia
members
potential
terrorists
radicals
etc
imagine
the
convenience
for
the
police
of
being
able
to
get
a
warrant
now
and
listening
to
all
the
calls
the
world
trade
center
bombers
made
in
the
past
year
since
archiving
would
be
such
a
powerful
tool
and
so
easy
to
do
why
wouldnt
it
happen
