ARTICLE
ARTHUR
RUBIN
WRITES
IN
NAGLENETCOMCOM
JOHN
NAGLE
WRITES
SINCE
THE
LAW
REQUIRES
THAT
WIRETAPS
BE
REQUESTED
BY
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
AND
APPROVED
BY
THE
JUDICIAL
BRANCH
IT
SEEMS
CLEAR
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
KEY
REGISTERING
BODIES
SHOULD
BE
UNDER
THE
CONTROL
OF
THE
JUDICIAL
BRANCH
I
SUGGEST
THE
SUPREME
COURT
OR
REGIONALLY
THE
COURTS
OF
APPEAL
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
THE
OFFICES
OF
THEIR
CLERKS
NOW
THAT
MAKES
SENSE
BUT
THE
OTHER
HALF
MUST
BE
IN
A
NONGOVERNMENT
ESCROW
GOOD
IDEA
BUT
WHY
PUT
ALL
THE
EGGS
IN
ONE
BASKET
GIVEN
THAT
THE
ESCROW
KEYS
ARE
GENERATED
AT
A
TIME
ON
FLOPPY
DISKS
WHY
NOT
KEEP
THEM
THERE
RATHER
THAN
CREATING
ONE
HUGE
DATABASE
THAT
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
GUARDED
BETTER
THAN
FORT
KNOX
GIVE
EACH
FLOPPY
TO
A
DIFFERENT
BANK
FOR
SAFEKEEPING
THE
USA
HAS
OVER
BANKS
AND
THRIFTS
THERE
ARE
NOT
LIKELY
TO
BE
MORE
THAN
CLIPPER
PHONES
SOLD
