oh
great
wonderful
news
nobody
can
listen
inexcept
the
feds
and
anybody
who
can
get
the
keys
from
the
escrow
company
this
is
a
database
thats
going
to
take
plenty
of
updating
they
think
they
can
keep
it
secure
please
and
thats
just
primary
not
secondary
sources
such
as
police
using
the
key
under
a
warrant
would
anyone
be
surprised
if
they
just
neglected
to
erase
the
key
if
it
turned
out
they
couldnt
nail
you
on
anything
nourish
a
waif
and
it
will
pick
out
your
eyes
