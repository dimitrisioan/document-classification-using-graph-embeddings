BIG
BROTHER
CLIPPER
CHIP
THERE
ARE
SOME
ISSUES
WHICH
COME
TO
MIND
WHEN
ONE
CONSIDERS
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
ASPECTS
OF
THE
USE
OF
THE
BIG
BROTHER
CLIPPER
CHIP
THE
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
TERRORISTS
ARENT
GOING
TO
LET
THEMSELVES
BE
CAUGHT
BY
USING
THIS
TYPE
OF
ENCRYPTION
IN
THE
NEW
YORK
TIMES
REPORTED
THAT
GOVERNMENT
INVESTIGATORS
BROKE
UP
A
NARCOTICS
RING
THAT
WAS
OPERATING
HIGHLY
SOPHISTICATED
EQUIPMENT
CAPABLE
OF
ALLOWING
THE
LEADERS
OF
THE
RING
TO
EAVESDROP
ON
THE
LAWENFORCEMENT
AGENTS
WHO
WERE
TRYING
TO
ARREST
THEM
A
MR
DEELY
AN
NSA
OFFICIAL
SAID
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
MEDIUMSIZED
COUNTRIES
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PROUD
TO
HAVE
THE
SIGNALS
INTELLIGENCE
OPERATION
OF
THIS
GROUP
FOR
EVERY
JOHN
GOTTI
THERE
ARE
PROBABLY
MANY
MORE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
THE
SOPHISTICATION
TO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
RISKS
OF
UNSECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
ARE
THE
PRESS
GIVEN
TO
THE
BIG
BROTHER
CHIP
WILL
ONLY
INCREASE
THEIR
NUMBERS
EVEN
IF
THERE
IS
SOME
BENEFIT
TO
LAWENFORCEMENT
THROUGH
THE
USE
OF
BIG
BROTHER
IT
MUST
BE
WEIGHED
AGAINST
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
AND
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
QUESTIONS
INVOLVED
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
SOME
AREAS
OF
THE
WORLD
TORTURE
IS
USED
AS
AN
INVESTIGATIVE
TOOL
BY
THE
LOCAL
LAWENFORCEMENT
PEOPLE
I
SUSPECT
IT
IS
AN
EFFECTIVE
MEANS
OF
OBTAINING
INFORMATION
AND
SHORTENING
MANY
INVESTIGATIONS
IT
PROBABLY
ALSO
HELPS
KEEP
THE
CONVICTION
RATE
HIGH
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
TORTURE
TOOL
IS
NOT
USED
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
EVEN
WITH
A
COURT
ORDER
OBTAINED
BY
SHOWING
PROBABLE
CAUSE
IS
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
RIGHTLY
BALANCED
THE
QUESTIONS
OF
EXPEDIENCY
AND
WHAT
IS
ETHICALLY
AND
MORALLY
RIGHT
I
THINK
THAT
THE
SAME
QUESTION
OF
EXPEDIENCY
VERSUS
MORALITY
SHOULD
COME
INTO
PLAY
WHEN
CONSIDERING
THE
USE
OF
BIG
BROTHER
I
VOTE
FOR
MORALITY
I
AM
QUITE
DISTURBED
BY
WHAT
I
INTERPRET
AS
A
VEILED
THREAT
TO
PROHIBIT
THE
USE
OF
ALL
ENCRYPTION
IF
THIS
BIG
BROTHER
CHIP
IS
NOT
PUT
INTO
WIDE
SPREAD
USE
AFTER
A
QUICK
READING
OF
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
PRESS
RELEASE
I
CAME
AWAY
WITH
THAT
IMPRESSION
TO
MOST
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PUBLIC
THE
WORD
HACKER
HAS
RIGHTLY
OR
WRONGLY
COME
TO
MEAN
HIGH
TECH
ADOLESCENT
VANDAL
IT
HAS
STRUCK
ME
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
POSTING
TO
SCICRYPT
REGARDING
THIS
ISSUE
ARE
INTELLIGENT
THOUGHTFUL
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
HAVE
GENUINE
CONCERNS
ABOUT
THE
PRIVACY
AND
CONSTITUTIONAL
ISSUES
SURROUNDING
BIG
BROTHER
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
USE
OF
BIG
BROTHER
DOES
NOT
BECOME
MANDATORY
AND
OTHER
ENCRYPTION
BECOME
ILLEGAL
I
WOULD
HATE
TO
SEE
THIS
BECOME
SOME
KIND
OF
HIGH
TECH
VOLSTEAD
ACT
THE
HIGH
SPEED
DIGITAL
COMMUNICATIONS
REVOLUTION
IS
COMING
AT
US
WITH
THE
SPEED
OF
AN
SST
THE
TIMES
THEY
ARE
A
CHANGING
AND
JUST
AS
IBM
IS
LEARNING
THAT
THEY
CANT
DO
BUSINESS
THE
SAME
WAY
THEY
HAVE
DONE
IT
FOR
THE
PAST
YEARS
MAYBE
NSA
SHOULD
EVALUATE
ANOTHER
APPROACH
EFF
WHO
HAVE
CORRECTLY
QUESTIONED
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
STRENGTH
OF
BIG
BROTHER
MAY
NEED
TO
SEND
A
STRONGER
MESSAGE
OUT
REGARDING
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
ISSUES
INVOLVED
AL
GORE
MAY
WANT
TO
THINK
THIS
ONE
THROUGH
A
LITTLE
MORE
AND
AS
FOR
DOROTHY
ELIZABETH
ROBLING
DENNING
EN
QUOI
CELA
VOUS
CONCERNE
