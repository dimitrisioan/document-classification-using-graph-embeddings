NSA
THE
NSA
IS
THE
OFFICIAL
SECURITY
BODY
OF
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
IT
WAS
GIVEN
ITS
CHARTER
BY
PRESIDENT
TRUMAN
IN
THE
LATE
AND
HAS
CONTINUED
RESEARCH
IN
CRYPTOLOGY
TILL
THE
PRESENT
THE
NSA
IS
KNOWN
TO
BE
THE
LARGEST
EMPLOYER
OF
MATHEMATICIANS
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
IS
ALSO
THE
LARGEST
PURCHASER
OF
COMPUTER
HARDWARE
IN
THE
WORLD
GOVERNMENTS
IN
GENERAL
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
PRIME
EMPLOYERS
OF
CRYPTOLOGISTS
THE
NSA
PROBABLY
POSSESSES
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
EXPERTISE
MANY
YEARS
AHEAD
OF
THE
PUBLIC
STATE
OF
THE
ART
AND
CAN
UNDOUBTEDLY
BREAK
MANY
OF
THE
SYSTEMS
USED
IN

FOR
REASONS
OF

THE

BETWEEN
PUBLIC

PRIVATE
RESEARCH
IN
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IF
ONE
REGARDS
CRYPTOLOGY
AS
THE
PREROGATIVE
OF
GOVERNMENT
ONE
ACCEPTS
THAT
MOST
CRYPTOLOGIC
RESEARCH
WILL
BE
CONDUCTED
BEHIND
CLOSED
DOORS
WITHOUT
DOUBT
THE
NUMBER
OF
WORKERS
ENGAGED
TODAY
IN
SUCH
SECRET
RESEARCH
IN
CRYPTOLOGY
FAR
EXCEEDS
THAT
OF
THOSE
ENGAGED
IN
OPEN
RESEARCH
IN
CRYPTOLOGY
FOR
ONLY
ABOUT
YEARS
HAS
THERE
IN
FACT
BEEN
WIDESPREAD
OPEN
RESEARCH
IN
CRYPTOLOGY
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
BE
CONFLICTS
BETWEEN
THESE
TWO
RESEARCH
COMMUNITIES
OPEN
RESEARCH
IS
COMMON
QUEST
FOR
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
DEPENDS
FOR
ITS
VITALITY
ON
THE
OPEN
EXCHANGE
OF
IDEAS
VIA
CONFERENCE
PRESENTATIONS
AND
PUBLICATIONS
IN
SCHOLARLY
JOURNALS
BUT
CAN
A
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
CHARGED
WITH
RESPONSIBILITIES
OF
BREAKING
THE
CIPHERS
OF
OTHER
NATIONS
COUNTENANCE
THE
PUBLICATION
OF
A
CIPHER
THAT
IT
CANNOT
BREAK
CAN
A
RESEARCHER
IN
GOOD
CONSCIENCE
PUBLISH
SUCH
A
CIPHER
THAT
MIGHT
UNDERMINE
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
HIS
OWN
GOVERNMENTS
CODEBREAKERS
ONE
MIGHT
ARGUE
THAT
PUBLICATION
OF
A
PROVABLYSECURE
CIPHER
WOULD
FORCE
ALL
GOVERNMENTS
TO
BEHAVE
LIKE
STIMSONS
GENTLEMEN
BUT
ONE
MUST
BE
AWARE
THAT
OPEN
RESEARCH
IN
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS
FRAUGHT
WITH
POLITICAL
AND
ETHICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
OF
A
SEVERITY
THAN
IN
MOST
SCIENTIFIC
FIELDS
THE
WONDER
IS
NOT
THAT
SOME
CONFLICTS
HAVE
OCCURRED
BETWEEN
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
AND
OPEN
RESEARCHERS
IN
CRYPTOLOGY
BUT
RATHER
THAT
THESE
CONFLICTS
AT
LEAST
THOSE
OF
WHICH
WE
ARE
AWARE
HAVE
BEEN
SO
FEW
AND
SO
MILD
WHAT
ARE
THE
US

IN
A
NUTSHELL
THERE
ARE
TWO
