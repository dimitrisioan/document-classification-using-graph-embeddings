why
is
there
such
a
strong
correlation
between
interest
in

and
immaturity
i
wonder
hmmm
check
your
facts
good
advice
lets
check
mr
cains
facts
a

some
limitation
let
me
guess
dont
use
the
code
in
any
way
pkp
or
rsa
doesnt
likesuch
asproviding
secure
communications
for
the
average
citizen
that
was
exactly
its
purpose
if
you
know
anything
about
it
there
is
nothing
at
all
preventing
the
average
citizen
using
it
only
selling
it
fact
it
is
unlawful
to
distribute
code
implementing
rsa
without
a
license
to
do
so
from
pkp
whether
or
not
one
is
charging
for
it
furthermore
any
use
of
rsa
other
than
for
research
purposes
allowed
under
us
patent
law
is
similarly
unlawful
therefore
the
average
citizen
cannot
use
rsa
to
encrypt
message
traffic
in
the
us
without
a
license
from
pkp
there
is
no
licensed
freely
available
product
in
the
us
that
uses
rsa
encryption
other
than
rsaref
and
hence
ripem
at
least
as
far
as
i
am
aware
if
you
know
of
another
please
post
it
here
all
i
have
to
say
isyeah
right
if
youre
willing
to
pay
them
mucho
big
bucks
andor
use
the
routines
they
tell
you
to
do
doesnt
sound
very
reasonable
to
me
all
i
have
to
say
is
this
is
full
of
shit
i
have
negotiated
a
license
and
the
bucks
are
incredibly
reasonable
with
an
upfront
charge
on
a
sliding
scale
depending
on
your
capitalization
if
you
are
a
startup
and
cant
afford
it
you
cant
afford
to
start
up
in
the
first
place
why
do
people
insist
on
making
unequivocal
statements
about
that
which
they
know
nothing
fact
the
last
contact
i
had
with
rsa
data
security
inc
was
with
some
guy
trying
to
sell
me
a
license
unsolicited
i
might
add
for
tipem
cost
plus
percent
royalties
i
suppose
it
is
a
matter
of
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
these
terms
count
as
mucho
bucks
or
incredibly
reasonable
either
way
however
this
definitely
falls
into
the
routines
they
tell
you
to
use
but
i
dont
guess
pkp
and
rsa
are
interested
in
big
bucks
maybe
they
have
some
other
agenda
secure
communications
only
for
government
agents
perhaps
have
you
considered
treatment
for
paranoia
the
government
is
the
single
biggest
thorn
in
rsas
side
fact
there
are
no
restrictions
yet
on
the
use
of
cryptography
under
us
law
although
this
is
beginning
to
look
like
it
will
change
the
only
impediments
to
widespread
use
of
rsa
cryptography
in
the
us
are
pkps
patents
mr
cain
please
shut
up
until
you
get
your
facts
straight
better
than
the
whole
world
be
destroyed
and
crumble
to
dust
than
a
free
man
deny
one
of
his
desires
