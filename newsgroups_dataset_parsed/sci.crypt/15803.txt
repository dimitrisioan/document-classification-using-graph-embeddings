WRITES
REMEMBER
IN
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
THEY
DESCRIBED
THIS
SCHEME
AS
BALANCING
THE
TWO
EXTREMES
OF
HAVING
NO
PRIVACY
AND
CLAIMING
THAT
CITIZENS
HAD
A
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT
TO
ENCRYPTION
SO
MUCH
FOR
CLINTONS
SUPPORT
OF
THE
RIGHT
OF
PRIVACY
THERES
AN
OUT
FOR
HIM
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
TALKED
ABOUT
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
I
BELIEVE
SPECIFICALLY
NOR
IS
THE
US
SAYING
THAT
EVERY
AMERICAN
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
IS
ENTITLED
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
EVERY
VENDOR
CLAIMS
HIS
PRODUCT
IS
UNBREAKABLE
SO
THIS
WAS
SLOPPY
WORDING
I
AM
NOT
CLAIMING
THAT
WE
PRIVATE
CITIZENS
SHOULD
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE

I
DONT
WANT
ANY

LET
THEM
BREAK
MY
PITIFUL
AMATEUR
ALGORITHMS
AND
RSAS
ALL
I
WANT
IS
WHAT
I
HAVE
ALREADY
THE
ABILITY
AND
RIGHT
TO
INVENT
AND
USE
MY
OWN
ALGORITHMS
SHARE
THEM
WITH
MY
FRIENDS
AND
