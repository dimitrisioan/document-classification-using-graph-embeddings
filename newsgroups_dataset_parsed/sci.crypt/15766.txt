PAUL
CROWLEY
WRITES
PERHAPS
THESE
ENCRYPTIONONLY
TYPES
WOULD
DEFEND
THE
DIGITIZED
PORN
IF
IT
WAS
POSTED
ENCRYPTED
THESE
ISSUES
ARE
NOT
AS
SEPERABLE
AS
YOU
MAINTAIN
IN
FACT
SINCE
EFFECTIVE
ENCRYPTION
MAKES
CENSORSHIP
IMPOSSIBLE
THEY
ARE
ALMOST
THE
SAME
ISSUE
AND
THEY
CERTAINLY
FALL
INTO
THE
BRIEF
OF
THE
EFF
IT
ALSO
FALLS
WITHIN
THE
PURVIEW
OF
THE
ACLU
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
THE
ACLU
OR
THE
EFF
WOULD
BE
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
INSTRUMENT
TO
WIN
THE
HEARTS
AND
MINDS
IN
FAVOR
OF
ACCESS
TO
CRYPTOGRAPHY
ITS
PRECISELY
SLOGANS
LIKE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
MAKES
CENSORSHIP
IMPOSSIBLE
WHICH
STAND
TO
TORPEDO
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
GENERATE
A
BROAD
CONSENSUS
IN
FAVOR
OF
ENCRYPTION
IT
IS
NOT
TRUE
AND
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
A
PUBLIC
DEBATE
IT
WOULD
BE
A
DANGEROUS
RED
HERRING
ADVOCATES
OF
STRONG
CRYPTO
HAD
BETTER
PREPARE
THEMSELVES
TO
ANSWER
SUCH
CHARGES
IN
PRAGMATIC
TERMS
THAT
LAYPEOPLE
AND
POLITICIANS
CAN
SYMPATHIZE
WITH
THE
USUAL
MUMBLINGS
ABOUT
CONSTITUTIONAL

ARE
NOT
ENOUGH
