no
but
they
could
compell
you
to
produce
the
key
to
a
safe
where
as
it
happens
evidence
that
will
convict
you
is
stored
the
cryptokey
disclosure
issue
hasnt
come
up
yet
but
current
law
suggests
that
its
a
loser
for
the
defendanthell
be
compelled
to
turn
over
the
key
the
test
for
compelled
selfincrimination
is
whether
the
material
to
be
disclosed
in
itself
tends
to
inculpate
the
discloser
in
the
example
i
gave
above
the
safe
key
itself
has
no
testimonial
valueergo
it
can
be
disclosed
under
compulsion
eg
subpoena
duces
tecum
moreover
the
government
can
always
immunize
the
disclosure
of
a
crypto
keycompelling
you
to
disclose
the
key
at
the
price
of
not
using
the
fact
of
your
disclosure
as
evidence
in
the
case
against
you
of
course
they
can
use
whatever
they
discover
as
a
result
of
this
disclosure
against
you
mike
lets
carry
this
one
step
further
suppose
the
text
of
the
key
is
in
itself
conclusive
evidence
of
the
same
crime
for
which
the
encrypted
material
is
further
evidence
i
find
myself
envisaging
a
scenario
like
this
you
have
made
some
scans
of
peanuts
strips
you
encrypt
them
the
key
is
a
phrase
the
comic
police
haul
you
in
they
seize
your
system
they
find
the
encrypted
file
cp
whats
that
file
you
i
take
the
fifth
cp
whats
the
keyphrase
to
that
file
you
i
take
the
fifth
judge
you
have
to
reveal
the
keyphrase
i
disagree
but
im
not
a
judge
you
your
honor
revealing
the
keyphrase
in
its
own
right
would
tend
to
incriminate
me
of
breaking
laws
independent
of
what
may
or
may
not
be
in
the
encrypted
file
judge
i
grant
you
immunity
from
whatever
may
be
learned
from
the
key
itself
you
the
keyphrase
is
i
confess
to
deliberately
evading
copyright
the
file
encoded
with
this
keyphrase
contains
illegal
scans
of
copyrighted
peanuts
strips
judge
and
cp
oh
how
will
they
get
you
now
im
not
saying
that
they
wont
or
cant
or
even
that
they
shouldnt
but
what
legal
mechanism
will
they
use
should
we
be
crossposting
