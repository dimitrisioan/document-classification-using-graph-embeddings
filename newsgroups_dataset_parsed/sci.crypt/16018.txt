I
WOULD
JUST
ADD
TO
PHILS
VERY
INFOMATIVE
DISCUSSION
THE
FOLLOWING
CAVEAT
THE
FIFTH
AMENDMENT
APPLIES
ONLY
IN
CRINIAL
CASES
NOR
SHALL
ANY
PERSON
BE
COMPELLED
IN
ANY
CRIMINAL
CASE
TO
BE
A

AGAINST
HIMSELF
MAYBE
YOU
ARE
USING
THE
WRONG
AMENDMENT
IF
SOMEONE
WERE
TO
SEIZE

THE
APPLICABLE
DEFENSE
WOULD
BE
ON

ANY

THEY

THEIR
