WHY
THE
CLIPPER
ALGORITHM
IS
SECRET
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
PROTOCOL
THOUGH
IS
ANOTHER
MATTER
I
SEE
NO
VALID
REASONS
FOR
KEEPING
IT
SECRET
AND
AS
I
HOPE
IVE
SHOWN
ABOVE
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
WAYS
TO
DO
THINGS
THAT
ARENT
QUITE
AS
BAD
IT
JUST
OCCURRED
TO
ME
WHY
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
SECRET
IF
IT
WERE
PUBLISHED
ONE
COULD
THEN
BUILD
PHYSICALLY
IDENTICAL
CLONE
VERSIONS
OF
THE
CHIP
THAT
WOULD
INTEROPERATE
WITH
OFFICIAL
CLIPPER
CHIPS
BUT
THE
CLONER
WOULDNT
PROVIDE
THE
KEYS
TO
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
HMMN
OR
IS
THERE
A
TECHNICAL
HACK
THAT
IVE
MISSED
EG
HOW
ABOUT
IF
THE
CHIPS
WERE
MADE
UNPROGRAMMED
BUT
SERIALIZED
AND
THEN
SHIPPED
TO
THE
TWO
ESCROW
HOUSES
WHO
PROGRAMMED
IN
THEIR
HALVES
OF
THE
KEYS
BUT
IN
A
WAY
THAT
REQUIRES
THAT
SECRET
KEYS
KNOWN
ONLY
TO
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
BE
INSTALLED
AS
WELL
WITHOUT
WHICH
CLONE
VERSIONS
WOULDNT
INTEROPERATE
THIS
IS
GETTING
AWFULLY
COMPLICATED
BUT
THATS
CRYPTO
