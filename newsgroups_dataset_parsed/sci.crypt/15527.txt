IM
ATTEMPTING
TO
WRITE
A
SERIOUS
POLICY
PAPER
EXAMINING
WHETHER
THE
PROPOSED
WIRETAP
OR
CLIPPER
CHIP
IS
A
COSTEFFECTIVE
TOOL
FOR
POLICE
INVESTIGATION
THAT
IS
IGNORING
CONCERNS
ABOUT
GOVERNMENT
INTRUSIONS
INTO
INDIVIDUAL
PRIVACY
IS
THE
VALUE
OF
EASY
WIRETAPS
TO
INVESTIGATORS
GREATER
THAN
THE
COST
TO
THE
COMMUNICATIONS
INDUSTRY
AND
THEIR
CUSTOMERS
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
WIRETAP
TECHNOLOGY
A
ROUGH
ESTIMATE
SUGGESTS
THAT
WIRETAPS
ARE
WORTH
ABOUT
FIVE
MILLION
DOLLARS
PER
YEAR
TO
US
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
IN
US
WIRETAPS
LED
TO
ARRESTS
WHILE
TOTAL
POLICE
EXPENDITURES
OF
BILLION
LED
TO
MILLION
ARRESTS
REF
US
STATISTICAL
ABSTRACTS
IM
WORKING
ON
ESTIMATING
THIS
WIRETAP
BENEFIT
MORE
ACCURATELY
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
ASK
HARDWARE
EXPERTS
OUT
THERE
TO
HELP
ME
WITH
ESTIMATING
THE
COSTS
OF
THE
NEW
PROPOSED
WIRETAP
TECHNOLOGY
PLEASE
SEND
ME
QUOTABLECITEABLE
ESTIMATES
FOR
HOW
MANY
CHIPS
WHICH
WOULD
NEED
TO
BE
MADE
PER
YEAR
TO
KEEP
ALL
PHONES
WITH
WIRETAP
CHIPS
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
IT
COST
TO
MAKE
EACH
CHIP
HOW
MUCH
DID
IT
COST
TO
DEVELOP
THIS
TECHNOLOGY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
HOW
MUCH
MORE
WOULD
SUPPORTING
HARDWARE
PEOPLE
ETC
COST
PER

WHAT
PERCENTAGE
CHEAPER
WOULD
ENCRYPTION
CHIPS
AND
SUPPORT
HAVE
BEEN
IF
PRIVATE
ENTERPRISE
COULD
COMPETE

MEET
CUSTOMER
ENCRYPTION
NEEDS
WHAT
PERCENTAGE
OF

WOULD
BE
TAKEN
UP
BY
THE
PROPOSED
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
BLOCKS
WHAT
IS
THE
TOTAL
COST
OF
HANDLING
ALL
PHONE
TRAFFIC
PER
YEAR
PUT
ANOTHER
WAY
THE
QUESTION
IM
ASKING
IS
WHAT
IF
EACH
POLICE
AGENCY
THAT
WANTED
A
PARTICULAR
WIRETAP
HAD
TO
PAY
FOR
IT
BEING
CHARGED
THEIR
SHARE
OF
THE
FULL
SOCIAL
COST
OF
FORCING
COMMUNICATION
TO
BE
WIRETAP
COMPATIBLE
WOULD
THEY
CHOOSE
TO
BUY
SUCH
WIRETAPS
OR
WOULD
THEY
FIND
IT
MORE
COSTEFFECTIVE
TO
INSTEAD
