GERMANO
CARONNI
WRITES
JUST
A
QUESTION
AS
A
PROVIDER
OF
A
PUBLIC
BBS
SERVICE
ARENT
YOU
BOUND
BY
LAW
TO
GURANTEE
INTELLIGBLE
ACCESS
TO
THE
DATA
OF
THE
USERS
ON
THE
BBS
IF
POLICE
COMES
WITH
SUFFICENT
AUTHORISATION
I
GUESSED
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
BASIC
CONDITION
FOR
SUCH
SYSTEMS
I
DID
RUN
A
BBS
SOME
TIME
AGO
BUT
THAT
WAS
IN
SWITZERLAND
THAT
SOUNDS
LIKE
AN
OLD
DRAGNET
EPISODE
JOE
AND
I
WENT
TO
THE
APARTMENT
OF
PRIME
SUSPECT
NOBODY
ANSWERED
THE
DOOR
BUT
HIS
LANDLORD
GAVE
US
PERMISSION
TO
SEARCH
THE
APARTMENT
PERHAPS
THAT
WORKED
IN
CALIFORNIA
IN
THE
BUT
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
LAW
LANDLORDS
DO
NOT
HAVE
AUTHORITY
TO
GRANT
PERMISSION
TO
SEARCH
SPACE
RENTED
BY
A
THIRD
PARTY
PROVIDED
THE
LEASE
IS
NOT
IN
DEFAULT
ETC
IM
NOT
EVEN
SURE
IF
THEY
CAN
PROVIDE
THE
MASTER
KEY
WHEN
SHOWN
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
SINCE
THE
SUBJECT
OF
THE
SEARCH
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
NOTIFIED
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
QUESTION
BECOMES
DID
THE
USER
RENT
THE
DISK
SPACE
HER
ENCRYPTED
FILE
OCCUPIES
IF
SHE
DID
IT
SHOULD
FALL
UNDER
THE
SAME
BODY
OF
CASE
LAW
THAT
APPLIES
TO
APARTMENTS
STORAGE
LOCKERS
ETC
AS
TO
WHETHER
ANY
COURT
WOULD
RECOGNIZE
THIS
FACT
IF
SHE
DID
NOT
IE
NO
COMPENSATION
EXCHANGED
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
IT
WOULD
BE
TREATED
THERE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
