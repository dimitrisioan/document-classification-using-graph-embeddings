CRIMINALS
WHO
VERY
BADLY
WANT
INSCRUTABLE
TACTICAL
COMMUNICATIONS
SPECIFICALL
THE
TERRORISTS
AND
DRUG
DEALERS
WHO
PROPONENTS
OF
KEY
ESCROW
CITE
AS
THREATS
WILL
BE
HIGHLY
MOTIVATED
TO
STEAL
THE
CIPHER
PHONE
OF
A
LEGITIMATE
USER
AND
TO
KILL
THIS
PERSON
OR
HOLD
THEM
HOSTAGE
SO
DISCOVERY
OF
COMPROMISE
OF
THE
DEVICE
WILL
BE
DELAYED
WHY
DOING
IT
IN
SUCH
A
ROUGH
MANNER
IT
IS
MUCH
MORE
PROFESSIONAL
TO
STEAL
THE
CHIP
FROM
THE
PHONE
AND
EVEN
TO
REPLACE
IT
WITH
A
PINCOMPATIBLE
DONOTHING
CHIP
THAT
DOES
NOT
ENCRYPT
AT
ALL
CHANCES
ARE
THAT
THE
VICTIM
WILL
NOT
NOTICE
ANYTHING
ESPECIALLY
IF
IT
IS
DONE
PROFESSIONALLY
ONCE
A
SUITABLE
COLLECTION
OF

IS
STOLEN
CRIMINALS
CAN
COMMUNICATE
WITH
IMPUNITY
ASSUMING
THE

CARRIES
NO
TRAPDOORS
APART
FROM
KEY
ESCROW
UNTIL
AND
UNLESS
THE
COMPROMISE
IS
DISCOVERED
BY
SOME
OTHER
MEANS
NO
BECAUSE
THE
FEDS
WILL
STILL
BE
ABLE
TO
DECRYPT
THE
CONVERSATIONS
TRUE
THEYLL
BLAME
THE
WRONG
GUYS
BUT
NEVERTHELESS
ONE
CANNOT
SAY
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
DRUGS
ARRIVE
TOMMORROW
ON
THE
SHIP
TERMINUS
WHEN
THE
FEDS
ARE
LISTENING
EVEN
IF
THEY
CANNOT
IDENTIFY
WHO
THE
SPEAKER
IS
NO
THE
CRIMINALS
WILL
JUST
USE
SOME
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
THE
NEW
PROPOSAL
DOES
NOT
STOP
CRIMINALS
IT
ENSURES
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
WIRETAP
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
AND
STOPS
THE
