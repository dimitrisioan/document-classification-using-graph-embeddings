ah
but
developing

are

domestic
spying
capabilities
takes
them
beyond
that
mandate
into
the
forbidden
field
of
domestic
wiretapping
unlike
the
cia
the
nsa
has
no
prohibition

read

the
puzzle
palace
i
did
youre
mistaken
nsas
communications
intelligence
mission
is
strictly
against
foreign
governments
heres
an
excerpt
from
the
enabling
charter
oct
truman
that
should
clarify
this
the
charter
was
declassified
in
about
feb
when
an
foia
request
made
it
public
mind
you
i
dont
know
that
they
never
collect
anything
theyre
not
supposed
to
but
spying
on
us
citizens
isnt
in
their
charter
b
the
comint
mission
of
the
national
security
agency
nsa
shall
be
to
provide
an
effective
unified
organization
and
control
of
the
communications
intelligence
activities
of
the
united
states
conducted
against
foreign
governments
to
provide
for
integrated
operational
policies
and
procedures
pertaining
thereto
as
used
in
this
directive
the
terms
communications
intelligence
or
comint
shall
be
construed
to
mean
all
procedures
and
methods
used
in
the
interception
of
communications
other
than
foreign
press
and
propaganda
broadcasts
and
the
obtaining
of
information
from
such
communications
by
other
than
intended
recipients
but
shall
exclude
censorship
and
the
production
and
dissemination
of
finished
intelligence
theyre
also
tasked
with
protecting
the
uss
communications
but
i
havent
seen
the
specific
enabling
memo
on
that
i
assume
thats
the
role
under
which
skipjack
was
developed
nsa
is
not
in
the
standardsetting
business
though
thats
why
this
clipper
stuff
came
from
nist
which
i
believe
is
tasked
with
coming
up
with
standards
based
on
their
best
inputs
from
other
government
agencies
which
would
include
