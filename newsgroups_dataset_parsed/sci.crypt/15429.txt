OF

RELUCTANTLY
LEAVING

FOR

APRIL
STATEMENT
BY
THE
PRESS
SECRETARY
THE
PRESIDENT
TODAY
ANNOUNCED
A
NEW
INITIATIVE
THAT
WILL
BRING
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TOGETHER
WITH
INDUSTRY
IN
A
VOLUNTARY
HUM
ATT
VLSI
AND
MYKOTRONX
ARE
INDUSTRY
WONDER
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
IBM
THIS
SHOULD
BE
RIGHT
UP
THEIR
STREET
AND
A
MANDATEED
SCHEME
IS
VOLUNTARY
MR
ORWELL
WOULD
LOVE
THIS
PROGRAM
TO
IMPROVE
THE
SECURITY
AND
PRIVACY
OF
TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATIONS
WHILE
MEETING
THE
LEGITIMATE
NEEDS
OF
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
TELEPHONE
ENCRYPTION
AND
SCRAMBLEING
ARE
YEARS
BEHIND
DIGITAL
ONES
LIKE
RSA
IDEA
OR
EVEN
DES
THE
ABOVE
WHILE
LITERALY
TRUE
IS
A
CLASIC
STRAWMAN
CLAIM
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
NONREALTIME
CIRCUITS
SUCH
AS
EMAIL
AND
THE
LIKE
THE
INITIATIVE
WILL
INVOLVE
THE
CREATION
OF
NEW
PRODUCTS
TO
ACCELERATE
THE
DEVELOPMENT
AND
USE
OF
ADVANCED
AND
SECURE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
NETWORKS
AND
WIRELESS
COMMUNICATIONS
LINKS
I
WOULD
MODESTLY
PROPOSE
THAT
A
MANDATED
USE
OF
ISDN
WOULD
DO
MORE
FOR
COMMUN
ICATIONS
THAN
THIS
LOT
FOR
TOO
LONG
THERE
HAS
BEEN
LITTLE
OR
NO
DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
OUR
PRIVATE
SECTOR
AND
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
COMMUNITY
TO
RESOLVE
THE
TENSION
BETWEEN
ECONOMIC
VITALITY
AND
THE
REAL
CHALLENGES
OF
PROTECTING
AMERICANS
RATHER
THAN
USE
TECHNOLOGY
TO
ACCOMMODATE
THE
SOMETIMES
COMPETING
INTERESTS
OF
ECONOMIC
GROWTH
PRIVACY
AND
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
PREVIOUS
POLICIES
HAVE
PITTED
GOVERNMENT
AGAINST
INDUSTRY
AND
THE
RIGHTS
OF

AGAINST

SOPHISTICATED
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
HAS
BEEN
USED
FOR
YEARS
TO
PROTECT
ELECTRONIC
FUNDS
TRANSFER
IT
IS
NOW
BEING
USED
TO
PROTECT
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
AND
COMPUTER
FILES
WHILE
ENCRYPTION
NORMMALY
DES
TECHNOLOGY
CAN
HELP
AMERICANS
PROTECT
BUSINESS
SECRETS
AND
THE
UNAUTHORIZED
RELEASE
OF
PERSONAL
INFORMATION
IT
ALSO
CAN
BE
USED
BY
TERRORISTS
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
OTHER
CRIMINALS
NOTE
THE
USE
OF
THE
WORD
BUSINESS
IN
THE
ABOVE
THE
WHOLE
TENOR
OF
THIS
RELEASE
SEEMS
TO
BE
ESTABLISHING
A
GROUND
RULE
THAT
ONLY
BUSINESS
USE
IS
LEGITIMATE
FOR
DEBATE
IF
YOU
WANT
THE
NOTHINGS
YOU
DROP
IN
YOUR
WIFES
EAR
TO
REMAIN
SECRET
AND
PRIVATE
THAT
IS
NOT
EVEN
ON
THE
AGENDA
FOR

NOTE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO

FOR
YOU
TO
CONTAIN

IN
THIS
THE
ONLY

IS
TO

ALREADY
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
OTHERS
THE
UNAUTHORIZED
RELEASE
BIT
IS
ALSO
DRAWING
A
LONG
BOW
MOST
OF
THESE
CASES
ARE
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
LEGITIMATE
ACCESS
ABUSING
IT
AND
REVEALING
OR
OFTEN
SELLING
THE
INFO
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
OF
COURSE
IN
THIS
PROPOSAL
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WILL
HAVE
THE
KEYS
THE
CRIMINALS
ALSO
USE
LAWERS
COURTS
THE
CIA
WHITEHOUSE
OFFICIALS
AND
PENS
TO
GO
ABOUT
THEIR
BUSINESS
WHEN
WILL
THEY
BE
OUTLAWED
AS
WELL
YEAH
SEVERAL
OF
THEM
WOULD
BE
A
BETTER
IDEA
THAN
CLIPPER
THEM
AGAIN
THE
PROTECTIONS
OF
LAW
AND
THE
COURTS
HAVE
BEEN
SERIOUSLY
ERRODED
OVER
THE
LAST
DECADE
OFR
SO
A
STATEOFTHEART
MICROCIRCUIT
CALLED
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
HAS
BEEN
DEVELOPED
BY
GOVERNMENT
ENGINEERS
THE
CHIP
REPRESENTS
A
NSA
NEW
APPROACH
TO
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
YEAH
THIS
BIT
IS
VERY
TRUE
IT
CAN
BE
USED
IN
NEW
RELATIVELY
INEXPENSIVE
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
THAT
CAN
BE
ATTACHED
TO
AN
ORDINARY
TELEPHONE
IT
SCRAMBLES
TELEPHONE
COMMUNICATIONS
USING
AN
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
THAT
IS
MORE
POWERFUL
THAN
MANY
IN
COMMERCIAL
USE
TODAY
NOTE
THE
REPEATED
MIXING
OF
TELEPHONE
SCRABELING
AND
ENCRYPTION
A
DEMO
OF
THE
ABOVE
CLAIM
ON
AN
ORDANARY
POTS
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
NIGHTS
ENTERTAINMENT
I
SUSPECT
NOTE
ALSO
THE
MANY
NOT
ALL
AS
THE
GENERAL
TONE
IMPLIES
THIS
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
WILL
HELP
COMPANIES
PROTECT
PROPRIETARY
INFORMATION
PROTECT
THE
PRIVACY
OF
PERSONAL
PHONE
CONVERSATIONS
AND
PREVENT
UNAUTHORIZED
RELEASE
OF
DATA
TRANSMITTED
ELECTRONICALLY
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THIS
TECHNOLOGY
PRESERVES
THE
ABILITY
OF
FEDERAL
STATE
AND
LOCAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
TO
INTERCEPT
LAWFULLY
THE
PHONE
CONVERSATIONS
OF
CRIMINALS
THE
CASE
RECORD
SEEMS
TO
INDICATE
THAT
WHAT
IS
NEEDED
IS
A
BRUTAL
TIGHTENING
OF
THE
CURRENT
ABUSES
I
HAVE
NOT
HEARD
YET
OF
A
CASE
THAT
WAS
IMPEADED
BY
THE
USE
OF
SECURE
ENCRYPTION
BY
THE
MEN
IN
BLACK
THE
OTHER
SIDE
ABUSE
BY

ENFORCERS
IS
WELL

EVEN
BY

AGENCIES
AND
THE

VS
OTHER
COMS
IS
BLURRED
YET
AGAIN
A
KEYESCROW
SYSTEM
WILL
BE
ESTABLISHED
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE

CHIP
IS
USED
TO
PROTECT
THE

OF

A

SYSTEM
WILL
BE
ESTABLISHED
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE

CHIP
IS
USED
TO
PROTECT
THE
PRIVACY
OF
LAWABIDING
AMERICANS
LETS
RUN
THAT
LINE
TWICE
NOT
VERY
CAREFULLY
WHAT
IT
SAYS
THE
STATED
PURPOSE
OF
THE
KEY
ESCHROW
IS
TO
MAKE
THE
USE
OF

COMPULSORY
NOTE
THE
WORD
ENSURE
AS
TO
PROTECT
OR
LAWABIDING
I
WILL
LEAVE
TO
YOU
SO
TO
THE
PERSON
WHO
ASKED
IF
IT
INCLUDED
THE
OUTLAWING
OF
OTHER
ENCRYPTIONS
THE
ANSWER
IN
THIS
PRESS
RELEASE
IS
YES
EACH
DEVICE
CONTAINING
THE
CHIP
WILL
HAVE
TWO
UNIQUE
KEYS
NUMBERS
THAT
WILL
BE
NEEDED
BY
AUTHORIZED
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
TO
DECODE
MESSAGES
ENCODED
BY
THE

WHEN
THE

IS
MANUFACTURED
THE
TWO

WILL
BE
DEPOSITED
SEPARATELY
IN
TWO
KEYESCROW
DATA
BASES
THAT
WILL
BE
ESTABLISHED
BY
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
ACCESS
TO
THESE

WILL
BE
LIMITED
TO
GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS
WITH
LEGAL
AUTHORIZATION
TO
CONDUCT
A

JUST
AS
THEY
ONLY
CAN

NOW
WITH
A

THE

CHIP
TECHNOLOGY
PROVIDES
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WITH
NO
NEW
AUTHORITIES
TO
ACCESS
THE
CONTENT
OF
THE
PRIVATE

OF
AMERICANS
JUST
MAKES
SURE
THAT
THE
ILLEGAL
ONES
ARE
PRESERVED
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
THIS
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
WILL
SOON
PURCHASE
SEVERAL
THOUSAND
OF
THE
NEW

IN
ADDITION
RESPECTED
EXPERTS
FROM
OUTSIDE
THE

WILL
BE
OFFERED
ACCESS
TO
THE

OF

TO

THEIR

WHERE
DO
YOU
FIND
MANY

ANY
EX

PEOPLE
LOOKING
FOR
A
CONTRACT
AND
AS
A
LATER
POSTING
ASKS
WHAT
OF
THE
STUIIIS
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
IT
WILL
BE
VERY
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
IF
THE
MILITARY
AND
US
EMBASIES
START
TO
USE
IT
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
SECURE
ISNT
IT
THE
GOVT
WILL
ANSWER
THAT
POINT
BY
ITS
OWN

THE

IS
AN
IMPORTANT
STEP
IN
ADDRESSING
THE
PROBLEM
OF
ENCRYPTIONS
DUALEDGE
SWORD
ENCRYPTION
HELPS
TO
PROTECT
THE
PRIVACY
OF
INDIVIDUALS
AND
INDUSTRY
BUT
IT
ALSO
CAN
SHIELD
CRIMINALS
AND
TERRORISTS
WE
NEED
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
OTHER
APPROACHES
THAT
CAN
BOTH
PROVIDE
LAWABIDING
CITIZENS
WITH

TO
THE
ENCRYPTION
THEY
NEED

PREVENT

FROM
USING
IT
TO
HIDE
THEIR

IN

TO
ASSESS
TECHNOLOGY
TRENDS
AND
EXPLORE
NEW
APPROACHES
LIKE
THE

SYSTEM
THE

HAS
DIRECTED
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
TO
DEVELOP
A
COMPREHENSIVE

ON

THAT
ACCOMMODATES
THE

OF
OUR
CITIZENS
INCLUDING
THE
NEED
TO
EMPLOY

ENCRYPTION
FOR

PURPOSES

PERSONAL

SEEMS
TO

A
UNASKABLE
QUESTION
THE
ABILITY

TO

AND

UNDER
PROPER
COURT
OR
OTHER
LEGAL
ORDER
WHEN
NECESSARY
TO

OUR

AH
SO
WARRENTS
ARE
NOT

IT
SEEMS
THE

USE
OF
THE
MOST
MODERN

TO

THE

Q

I
BE

THE

WE

YOU
ARE
ONE
OF

Q
IF
THE

PROPOSED
WOULD
THE

BE
WILLING
TO
USE
LEGAL
REMEDIES
TO
RESTRICT

TO

A
THIS
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL

QUESTION
WHICH
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED

THE

THEY

TOO
MECHANISM
WILL

WITH
AN

PRODUCT
THAT
IS
MORE
SECURE
MORE
CONVENIENT
AND
LESS
EXPENSIVE
THAN
OTHERS
READILY

TODAY
BUT
IT
IS
JUST
ONE
PIECE
OF
WHAT
MUST
BE
THE
COMPREHENSIVE
APPROACH
TO
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
WHICH
THE

IS
DEVELOPING
I
WOULD
SAY
LESS
SECURE
LESS
CONVENIANT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
PGP
IS
FREE
LESS
AVAILABLE
AND
MORE
PRONE
TO
BEING
COMPRIMISED
PROOFS
TO
THE

WILL
BE
WELCOME
NOTE
PROOF
THE

IS
NOT
SAYING
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
THREATENS
THE
PUBLIC
SAFETY
AND
EFFECTIVE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WE
WILL
PROHIBIT
IT
OUTRIGHT
AS
SOME
COUNTRIES
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
DONE
NOR
IS
THE
US
SAYING
THAT
EVERY
AMERICAN
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
IS
ENTITLED
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THEY
DONT
SEEM
TO
BE
SAYING
ANYTHING
THAT
MAKES
MUCH
SENSE
AND
THIS
PROPOSAL
DOES
PROHIBIT
IT
EXCEPT
IN
A
VERY
LIMITED
WAY
AND
THIS
IS
THE
ONE
EXPLICIT
REFERENCE
TO
PERSONAL
RIGHTS
IT
IS
A
DENIAL
AND
YES
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THE
MEXICANS
BRAZILIANS
AND
CANUCKS
ARE
INCLUDED
IN
CLINTON
ET
ALS
MAGNANAMOUS
GESTURE
THERE
IS
A
FALSE
TENSION
CREATED
IN
THE
ASSESSMENT
THAT
THIS

IS
AN
EITHEROR
PROPOSITION
RATHER
BOTH
CONCERNS
CAN
BE
AND
IN

ARE
HARMONIOUSLY
BALANCED
THROUGH
A
REASONED
BALANCED
APPROACH
SUCH
AS
IS
PROPOSED
WITH
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
SIMILAR
ENCRYPTION
TECHNIQUES
THE
FALSE
TENSION
IS
FALSE
THE
BALANCE
IS
BETWEEN
TWO
REPUGNANT
POINTS
THE
