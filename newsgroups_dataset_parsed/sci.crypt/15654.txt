the
chip
and
algorithm
are
classified
if
you
reverse
engineer
it
and
tell
people
you
are
likely
to
go
to
jail
i
dont
find
this
a
credible
argument
for
two
reasons
one
you
have
supplied
below
unless
i
care
about
entering
the
usa
at
any
time
in
the
future
eg
the
taiwanese
backyard
cloners
who
btw
have
been
known
to
decap
custom
silicon
and
reproduce
it
on
daughterboards
when
pirating
highprofit
arcade
machines
and
the
like
who
wouldnt
care
less
i
am
not
going
to
care
much
about
us
confidentiality
am
i
only
people
like
the
real
me
who
does
care
about
travelling
to
various
countries
for
business
reasons
will
sit
up
and
follow
laws
like
this
but
i
would
contend
that
were
not
the
main
threat
i
also
have
grave
doubts
whether
an
algorythm
widely
distributed
in
silicon
could
possibly
be
called
classified
its
like
handing
out
military
secrets
to
the
whole
world
in
envelopes
marked
dont
open
me
i
can
imagine
several
credible
defences
which
could
be
employed
if
it
came
to
a
trial
one
would
be
the
stupidity
of
the
governments
actions
perhaps
some
foreign
governments
or
corporations
could
help
us
out
by
cracking
the
system
outside
the
usa
the
us
government
could
probably
stop
importation
of
clone
hardware
but
a
software
implementation
should
be
practical
amusing
thought
could
they
have
employed
an
algorythm
which
is
infeasable
for
a
fast
software
implementation
but
which
is
easy
in
custom
hardware
in
des
the
extensive
use
of
permutation
tables
trivial
in
hardware
you
just
swap
bus
lines
but
relatively
slow
in
software
have
had
a
big
effect
on
the
speed
difference
between
hardware
and
software
implementations
of
that
cipher
indeed
i
suspect
that
lucifers
designers
were
well
aware
that
it
would
be
and
approved
certain
algorythms
usually
parallel
search
algorythms
can
be
very
slow
in
software
yet
can
fly
in
custom
hardware
i
have
no
proof
of
their
employment
in
clipper
it
is
pure
conjecture
however
as
a
software
implementation
of
this
cipher
is
something
that
its
designers
would
have
been
trying
to
avoid
at
all
costs
then
the
inclusion
of
such
techniques
seems
credible
hmmm
i
also
wonder
what
intergraph
thinks
about
the
use
of
the
name
clipper
for
this
device
