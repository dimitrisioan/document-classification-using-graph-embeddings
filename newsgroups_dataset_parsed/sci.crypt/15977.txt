HAL
FINNEY
WRITES
I
TRIED
THIS
CODE
YESTERDAY
ON
MY
SPARCSTATION
ELC
IT
TAKES
OVER
SECONDS
TO
COMPRESS
SECONDS
WORTH
OF
SPEECH
THIS
MEANS
THAT
IT
NEEDS
TO
BE
OPTIMIZED
BY
OVER
A
FACTOR
OF
BEFORE
IT
WILL
BE
USABLE
IN
EVEN
A
HALFDUPLEX
MODE
OUCH
THANKS
FOR
TRYING
IT
I
QUESTION
WHETHER
CELP
IS
THE
BEST
APPROACH
FOR
THIS
APPLICATION
IT
PRODUCES
GREAT
COMPRESSION
BUT
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
TREMENDOUS
CPU
LOADS
WE
WANT
SOMETHING
THAT
CAN
BE
RUN
ON
ORDINARY
WORKSTATIONS
OR
EVEN
HIGHEND
PCS
WITHOUT
DSP
CARDS
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
SOME
OTHER
ALGORITHM
IS
GOING
TO
BE
A
BETTER
STARTING
POINT
YES
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
MY
XPOSTING
TO
COMPSPEECH
MADE
IT

IVE
FOUND
THAT
A

PLUS
THE

COMPRESSION
CODE
ACTUALLY
DOES
GET
SPEECH
INTO

LEFT

THIS
IS
DEFINITELY
