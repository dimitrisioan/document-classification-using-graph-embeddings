oh
great
wonderful
news
nobody
can
listen
inexcept
the
feds
hey
its
better
than
the
status
quo
i
am
far
less
worried
about
the
feds
tapping
my
phone
than
high
school
scanner
surfers
who
get
their
kicks
out
of
eavesdropping
on
cellular
and
cordless
phone
calls
im
a
political
dissident
im
scared
shitless
of
the
feds
listening
in
on
my
calls
my
opinions
are
the
sort
that
would
get
me
disappeared
in
a
slightly
less
free
society
and
who
knows
what
sort
of
society
we
will
be
in
in
five
or
ten
years
i
have
friends
who
have
had
their
phones
tapped
none
of
this
is
theoretical
to
me
as
for
its
better
than
the
status
quo
well
first
of
all
you
can
get
a
cryptophone
from
companies
like
cylink
today
and
they
work
well
in
addition
a
number
of
groups
are
now
working
on
building
software
to
turn
any
pc
into
a
privacy
enhanced
phone
right
now
and
they
are
all
working
in
overdrive
mode
and
yes
id
rather
just
see
all
crypto
restrictions
lifted
but
this
is
at
least
an
incrememental
improvement
for
certain
applications
there
are
no
crypto
restrictions
yet
you
can
use
anything
you
want
right
now
the
point
is
to
maintain
that
right
