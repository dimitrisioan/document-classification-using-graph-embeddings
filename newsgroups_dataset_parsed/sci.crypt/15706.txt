THAT
CAN

VERIFIED
EXTERNALLY
GEE
SAY
THEY
FEED
THE
KEY
THROUGH
AND
TAKE
THE
FIRST
BITS
OF
THE

USE
THOSE
BITS
AS
THE
REAL
KEY
HOW
DO
YOU
FIGURE
OUT
THAT
EACH
KEY
IS
ONE
OF
EQUAL
KEYS
YOU
CAN
TRY
A

ATTACK
BUT
IF
THE
KEY
CAN
BE
CHANGED
ONLY
ONCE
A
SECOND
THEN
YOU
WILL
NEED
SEVERAL
LIFETIMES

RETRACT
