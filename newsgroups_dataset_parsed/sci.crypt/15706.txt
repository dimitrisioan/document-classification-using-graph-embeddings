externally
gee
say
they
feed
the
key
through
and
take
the
first
bits

the
result
then
use
those
bits
as
the
real
key
how
do
you
figure
out
that
each

is
one

keys
you

if
the

you
will
need
several

to

statistics
youre
right
and
i
retract
the
suggestion
still
i
wonder
that
there
are
only
bits
of

should
in

be

maybe
some
