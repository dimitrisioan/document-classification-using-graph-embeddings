my
father
having
worked
for
american
cyanamid
for
sometime
did
mention
that
the
recipe
is
a
secret
neither
of
us
know
of
just
how
toxic
the
stuff
isbut
you
can
synthesize
a
simliar
substance
that
is
available
to
just
about
any
organic
labcalled
luminol
you
can
usually
find
this
in
an
organic
lab
book
or
something
similiar
these
substances
are
normally
not
the
secret
but
how
to
get
at
them
the
method
of
preperation
is
normally
patented
which
means
that
noone
else
can
make
the
chemical
in
the
same
way
without
undergoing
an
agreement
with
american
cyanamid
but
i
guess
you
knew
what
a
patent
is
if
you
know
what
substance
is
used
youll
also
know
its
toxicity
rumor
has
it
that
luminol
is
some
base
form
for
the
stuff
used
in
the
light
sticks
the
luminol
reaction
has
the
disadvantage
of
not
lasting
as
long
as
the
commercial
version
remember
that
cyano
compounds
are
found
in
nature
and
not
all
are
poisonous
