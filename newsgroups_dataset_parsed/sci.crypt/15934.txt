BACK
DOORS
IN
CLIPPER
I
THINK
IT
VERY
UNLIKELY
THERE
ARE
BACK
DOORS
IN
CLIPPER
FOR
TWO
REASONS
THE
GOVERNMENT
DOESNT
NEED
THEM
IF
IT
CAN
GET
THE
KEY
AND
YES
I
ASSUME
THAT
THE
OFFICIAL
GOVERNMENT
OBEYS
COURT
ORDERS
ETCAND
THAT
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
CHIP
AND
ITS
APPROVAL
WERE
OFFICIAL
IT
WOULD
DEFEAT
THE
WHOLE
PURPOSE
OF
PROVIDING
SECURE
CRYPTO
FOR
AMERICAN
BUSINESS
THAT
COULDNT
BE
READ
BY
OUR
ECONOMIC
ADVERSARIES
IF
THIS
WERE
NOT
A
LEGITIMATE
AND
GENUINE
PURPOSE
AND
AS
MANY
THINK
THE
NSA
CAN
READ
DES
WHY
BOTHER
OTHERWISE
RATIONAL
RESPONSES
PREFERRED
TO
CONSPIRACY
THEORIES
THANKS
DAVID
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
GREAT
CARE
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
TO
ENSURE
THE
ACCURACY
OF
OUR
INFORMATION
ERRORS
AND
OMISSIONS
EXCEPTED
