can
someone
tell
me
if
hardware
compression
is
or
is
not
needed
to
run
digital
speech
down
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit
samples
would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to
be
as
far
as
i
know
isdn
call
it
swissnet
here
and
its
being
plugged
in
its
bit
gives
you
one
channel
of
i
guess
you
should
not
go
below
a
sampling
rate
of
hz
if
you
want
to
have
same
quality
as
on
an
analogline
anybody
knows
compressionalgorithms
factors
for
voice
ive
posted
some
info
on
celp
coding
on
scicrypt
looks
like
you
can
squeeze
speech
into
if
you
have
a
fast
enough
computer
like
a
sparcstation
or
a
newton
with
the
acorn
risc
machine
in
it
this
drops
the
bandwidth
to
so
low
a
figure
that
its
feasible
to
run
speech
over
tcpip
running
on
top
of
slip
down
a
modem
not
only
will
this
let
us
run
point
to
point
encrypted
speech
itll
let
us
run
speech
internationally
over
the
internet
if
noone
stops
us
by
getting
very
heavy
about
regulations
the
thought
of
this
if
the
administration
realised
would
probably
scare
them
shitless
now
of
course
the
trick
is
to
develop
and
define
a
standard
protocol
for
internet
speech
damn
fast
allowing
anyone
who
feels
brave
to
inplement
custom
handheld
hardware
as
well
as
us
hacking
it
on
our
workstations
shouldnt
be
too
difficult
the
celp
stuff
is
standardised
we
use
tcpip
streams
and
a
protocol
allowing
silences
to
be
used
to
catch
up
on
any
net
lag
and
also
to
avoid
sending
any
data
during
silences
ie
its
not
wise
to
be
synchronised
realtime
on
each
end
because
any
net
delays
would
add
up
to
big
voicelags
as
for
me
im
going
to
press
ahead
on
trying
this
stuff
as
soon
as
i
get
my
sparc
back
from
being
loaned
out
and
buy
the
necessary
microphone
itll
save
me
a
fortune
in
calling
my
friend
in
texas
every
night
whether
encrypted
or
not
you
know
surely
someone
is
working
on
this
who
its
so
obvious
why
doesnt
it
exist
already
ive
only
seen
netphone
for
suns
and
it
didnt
do
the
celp
compression
so
was
restricted
to
ether
connections
