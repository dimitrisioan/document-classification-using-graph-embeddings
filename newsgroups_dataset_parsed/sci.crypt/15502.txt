how
large
are
commercial
keys
what
are
the
typical
sizes
for
keys
for
commercial
secret
key
algorithms
i
know
des
is
bits
tripple
des
is
bits
and
idea
is
bits
is
there
anything
made
in
the
us
that
has
bit
keys
anything
anywhere
that
has
larger
keys
ive
heard
that
can
be
scaled
to
arbitrarily
large
keys
but
is
this
actually
implemented
anywhere
finally
can
anyone
even
concieve
of
a
timeplace
where
bit
keys
arent
sufficient
i
certainly
cant
even
at
a
trillion
keys
a
second
it
would
take
about
billion
years
to
search
just
one
billionth
of
that
keys
space
thanks
