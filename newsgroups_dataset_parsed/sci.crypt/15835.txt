the
point
remains
more
and
more
i
see
the
government
slowly
washing
away
privacy
even
unwittingly
do
you
think
i
will
ever
live
in
a
soceity
that
issues
smart
cards
to
citizens
at
birth
do
you
think
i
will
live
in
a
soceity
that
insists
i
register
my
crypto
keys
so
they
can
keep
track
of
what
im
saying
even
if
there
is
no
evidence
of
my
guilt
do
you
think
i
will
ever
live
in
a
soceity
that
seeks
to
meddle
in
the
affairs
of
its
citizenry
without
recourse
of
any
kind
im
tired
of
it
there
is
imho
no
compromise
with
an
administration
that
seeks
to
implement
these
proposals
under
the
guise
of
enhancing
privacy
more
than
the
proposals
themselves
i
read
the
language
of
the
press
releases
the
obvious
deception
involved
in
presenting
these
pieces
to
the
public
and
i
am
sickened
i
am
revolted
i
am
repulsed
perhaps
even
of
this
country
could
care
less
about
the
clipper
chip
the
wiretap
bill
the
smart
card
because
they
are
so
entrapped
in
the
rhetoric
of
the
clinton
administration
this
saddens
and
frightens
me
i
am
a
conserveative
believe
it
or
not
a
law
and
order
conserveative
but
the
move
to
a
centralized
authoratarian
regime
really
scares
me
mostly
because
i
know
you
cant
go
far
wrong
underestimating
the
intelligence
of
the
american
people
tell
them
its
going
to
keep
them
safe
from
drug
dealers
and
terrorists
and
they
will
let
you
put
cameras
in
their
home
even
in
the
wake
of
waco
you
find
those
who
support
the
increasingly
totalatarian
moves
to
be
quite
honest
the
way
things
are
going
id
call
it
self
defense
and
i
dont
want
mine
growning
up
in
the
eyes
of
a
security
camera
hours
a
day
i
never
advocated
not
saying
what
you
believe
in
im
advocating
second
thought
and
calm

a

defeats
