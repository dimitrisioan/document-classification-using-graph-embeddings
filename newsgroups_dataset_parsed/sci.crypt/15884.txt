messagedigest
algorithm
developed
by
ron
rivest
maps
a
message
to
a
message
digest
computing
the
digest
of
a
onemegabyte
message
takes
as
little
as
a
second
while
no
messagedigest
algorithm
can
yet
be
em
proved
secure
is
believed
to
be
at
least
as
good
as
any
other
that
maps
to
a
digest
inversion
should
take
about
operations
and
collision
should
take
about
operations
no
one
has
found
a
faster
approach
to
inversion
or
collision
recent
work
by
den
boer
and
bosselaers
presents
a
special
kind
of
pseudocollision
in
internal
compression
function
which
maps
a
message
block
x
and
a
input
state
s
to
a
output
state
they
show
how
to
find
a
message
block
x
and
two
related
input
states
and
that
yield
the
same
output
state
their
wellthought
approach
exploits
structural
properties
of
the
collision
function
to
find
a
pseudocollision
in
about
operations
much
less
than
one
would
expect
practical
implications
of
this
pseudocollision
work
to
the
security
of
are
not
evident
while
a
real
collision
in
implies
a
pseudocollision
or
a
pseudoinversion
a
pseudocollision
need
not
imply
a
real
collision
indeed
a
real
collision
since
it
involves
two
different
messages
would
almost
always
involve
em
different
message
blocks
and
such
that
but
the
pseudocollisions
have
the
same
message
blocks
moreover
the
input
states
and
would
generally
be
unrelated
but
the
pseudocollisions
input
states
are
the
same
except
for
four
bits
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
way
to
extend
den
boer
and
bosselaers
approach
to
anything
beyond
the
special
pseudocollisions
a
limitation
they
readily
admit
it
is
reasonable
therefore
to
believe
that
remains
secure
while
den
boer
and
bosselaers
have
found
interesting
structural
properties
in
the
properties
seem
only
to
lead
to
special
pseudocollisions
and
not
anything
approaching
real
collisions
further
research
of
course
will
give
a
better
understanding
of
the
strengths
of
and
other
messagedigest
algorithms
with
the
eventual
hope
that
such
algorithms
can
in
some
sense
be
proved
