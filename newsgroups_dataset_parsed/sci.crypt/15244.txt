WHAT
IS
AN

IN

TERMS
A
PASSIVE
ATTACK
ON
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
IS
ANY
METHOD
OF
STARTING
WITH
SOME
INFORMATION
ABOUT
PLAINTEXTS
AND
THEIR
CORRESPONDING
CIPHERTEXTS
UNDER
SOME
UNKNOWN
KEY
AND
FIGURING
OUT
MORE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
PLAINTEXTS
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
STATE
MATHEMATICALLY
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
HERE
WE
GO
FIX

G
AND

OF

FIX
AN

SUCH

THERE

OF

THIS

HERE
RANGE

HAVE
NO

AN

IS

IF
IT
DOESNT
ACTUALLY
USE
THE
ENCRYPTIONS
AN

IS
CALLED
ONECIPHERTEXT
IF

TWOCIPHERTEXT
IF
N
AND
SO
ON
WHATS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
FORMULATING
ALL
THIS
MATHEMATICALLY
IN
BASIC
CRYPTOLOGY
YOU
CAN
NEVER
PROVE
THAT
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
IS
SECURE
READ
PART
WE
KEEP
SAYING
A
STRONG
CRYPTOSYSTEM
MUST
HAVE
THIS
PROPERTY
BUT
HAVING
THIS
PROPERTY
IS
NO
GUARANTEE
THAT
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
IS
STRONG
IN
CONTRAST
THE
PURPOSE
OF
MATHEMATICAL
CRYPTOLOGY
IS
TO
PRECISELY
FORMULATE
AND
IF
POSSIBLE
PROVE
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
IS
STRONG
WE
SAY
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
IS
SECURE
AGAINST
ALL
PASSIVE
ATTACKS
IF
ANY
NONTRIVIAL
ATTACK
AGAINST
THE
SYSTEM
AS
DEFINED
ABOVE
IS
TOO
SLOW
TO
BE
PRACTICAL
IF
WE
CAN
PROVE
THIS
STATEMENT
THEN
WE
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
THAT
OUR
CRYPTOSYSTEM
WILL
RESIST
ANY
PASSIVE
CRYPTANALYTIC
TECHNIQUE
IF
WE
CAN
REDUCE
THIS
STATEMENT
TO
SOME
WELLKNOWN
UNSOLVED
PROBLEM
THEN
WE
STILL
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
THAT
THE
CRYPTOSYSTEM
ISNT
EASY
TO
BREAK
OTHER
PARTS
OF
CRYPTOLOGY
ARE
ALSO
AMENABLE
TO
MATHEMATICAL
DEFINITION
AGAIN
THE
POINT
IS
TO
EXPLICITLY
IDENTIFY
WHAT
ASSUMPTIONS
WERE
MAKING
AND
PROVE
THAT
THEY
PRODUCE
THE
DESIRED
RESULTS
WE
CAN
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
IT
MEANS
FOR
A
PARTICULAR
CRYPTOSYSTEM
TO
BE
USED
PROPERLY
IT
JUST
MEANS
THAT
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
VALID
THE
SAME
METHODOLOGY
IS
USEFUL
FOR
CRYPTANALYSIS
TOO
THE
CRYPTANALYST
CAN
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
INCORRECT
ASSUMPTIONS
OFTEN
HE
CAN
TRY
TO
CONSTRUCT
A
PROOF
OF
SECURITY
FOR
A
SYSTEM
SEE
WHERE
THE
PROOF
FAILS
AND
USE
THESE
FAILURES
AS
THE
STARTING
POINTS
FOR
HIS
ANALYSIS
WHY
IS
THE
ONETIME
PAD
SECURE
BY
DEFINITION
THE
ONETIME
PAD
IS
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
WHERE
THE
PLAINTEXTS
CIPHERTEXTS
AND
KEYS
ARE
ALL
STRINGS
SAY
BYTE
STRINGS
OF
SOME
LENGTH
M
AND
EKP
IS
JUST
THE
SUM
LETS
SAY
THE
EXCLUSIVE
OR
OF
K
AND
P
IT
IS
EASY
TO
PROVE
MATHEMATICALLY
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
NONTRIVIAL
SINGLECIPHERTEXT
ATTACKS
ON
THE
ONETIME
PAD
ASSUMING
A
UNIFORM
DISTRIBUTION
OF
KEYS
NOTE
THAT
WE
DONT
HAVE
TO
ASSUME
A
UNIFORM
DISTRIBUTION
OF
PLAINTEXTS
HERES
THE
PROOF
LET
A
BE
AN
ATTACK
IE
AN
ALGORITHM
TAKING
TWO
INPUTS
F
G
AND
PRODUCING
ONE
OUTPUT
H
WITH
SOME
PROBABILITY
P
THAT
H
HP
WHENEVER
F
FP
AND
G
GEKP
IE
G
GK
P
THEN
BECAUSE
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
K
IS
UNIFORM
AND
INDEPENDENT
OF
P
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
K
P
MUST
ALSO
BE
UNIFORM
AND
INDEPENDENT
OF
P
BUT
ALSO
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
C
IS
UNIFORM
AND
INDEPENDENT
OF
P
HENCE
THERE
IS
PROBABILITY
EXACTLY
P
THAT
H
HP
WHENEVER
F
FP
AND
G
GC
OVER
ALL
P
AND
C
THUS
A
FORTIORI
A
IS
TRIVIAL
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
ONETIME
PAD
IS
NOT
SECURE
IF
A
KEY
K
IS
USED
FOR
MORE
THAN
ONE
PLAINTEXT
IE
THERE
ARE
NONTRIVIAL
MULTIPLECIPHERTEXT
ATTACKS
SO
TO
BE
PROPERLY
USED
A
KEY
K
MUST
BE
THROWN
AWAY
AFTER
ONE
ENCRYPTION
THE
KEY
IS
ALSO
CALLED
A
PAD
THIS
EXPLAINS
THE
NAME
ONETIME
PAD
WHATS
A
CIPHERTEXTONLY
ATTACK
IN
THE
NOTATION
ABOVE
A
CIPHERTEXTONLY
ATTACK
IS
ONE
WHERE
F
IS
CONSTANT
GIVEN
ONLY
SOME
INFORMATION
ABOUT
N
CIPHERTEXTS
THE
ATTACK
HAS
TO
HAVE
SOME
CHANCE
OF
PRODUCING
SOME
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
PLAINTEXTS
THE
ATTACK
IS
TRIVIAL
IF
IT
HAS
JUST
AS
GOOD
A
CHANCE
OF
PRODUCING
WHEN
GIVEN
FOR
RANDOM
FOR
EXAMPLE
SAY
GC
C
AND
SAY
HP
IS
THE
FIRST
BIT
OF
P
WE
CAN
EASILY
WRITE
DOWN
AN
ATTACKTHE
GUESSING
ATTACK
WHICH
SIMPLY
GUESSES
THAT
HP
IS
THIS
ATTACK
IS
TRIVIAL
BECAUSE
IT
DOESNT
USE
THE
CIPHERTEXT
IT
HAS
A
FIFTYFIFTY
CHANCE
OF
GUESSING
CORRECTLY
NO
MATTER
WHAT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THERE
IS
AN
ATTACK
ON
RSA
WHICH
PRODUCES
ONE
BIT
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
P
WITH
SUCCESS
USING
C
IF
IT
IS
FED
A
RANDOM
C
THEN
THE
SUCCESS
RATE
DROPS
TO
SO
THIS
IS
A
NONTRIVIAL
ATTACK
WHATS
A
KNOWNPLAINTEXT
ATTACK
THE
CLASSIC
KNOWNPLAINTEXT
ATTACK
HAS
AND
DEPENDING
ONLY
ON
IN
OTHER
WORDS
GIVEN
TWO
CIPHERTEXTS
AND
AND
ONE
DECRYPTION
THE
KNOWNPLAINTEXT
ATTACK
SHOULD
PRODUCE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
OTHER
DECRYPTION
NOTE
THAT
KNOWNPLAINTEXT
ATTACKS
ARE
OFTEN
DEFINED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
AS
PRODUCING
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
KEY
BUT
THIS
IS
POINTLESS
THE
CRYPTANALYST
GENERALLY
CARES
ABOUT
THE

ONLY
INSOFAR
AS
IT
LETS
HIM
DECRYPT
FURTHER
MESSAGES
WHATS
A
CHOSENPLAINTEXT

A
CHOSENPLAINTEXT
ATTACK
IS
THE
FIRST
OF
AN
INCREASINGLY
IMPRACTICAL
SERIES
OF
ACTIVE
ATTACKS
ON
A
CRYPTOSYSTEM
ATTACKS
WHERE
THE
CRYPTANALYST
FEEDS
DATA
TO
THE
ENCRYPTOR
THESE
ATTACKS
DONT
FIT
INTO
OUR
MODEL
OF
PASSIVE
ATTACKS
EXPLAINED
ABOVE
ANYWAY
A
CHOSENPLAINTEXT
ATTACK
LETS
THE
CRYPTANALYST
CHOOSE
A
PLAINTEXT
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
CORRESPONDING
CIPHERTEXT
THEN
REPEAT
UNTIL
HE
HAS
FIGURED
OUT
HOW

ANY

MORE
ABSURD
EXAMPLES
OF
THIS
SORT
OF
ATTACK
ARE
THE
CHOSENKEY
ATTACK
AND
CHOSENSYSTEM
ATTACK
A
MUCH
MORE
IMPORTANT
FORM
OF

IS
A

THE

TRIES
TO
CHANGE
THE
CIPHERTEXT
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
AS
TO
MAKE
A
USEFUL
CHANGE
IN
THE
PLAINTEXT
THERE
ARE
MANY
EASY
WAYS
TO
THROW
KINKS
INTO
ALL
OF
THESE
