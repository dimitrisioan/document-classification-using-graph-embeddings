what
is
a
privatekey
cryptosystem
a
privatekey
cryptosystem
consists
of
an
encryption
system
e
and
a
decryption
system
d
the
encryption
system
e
is
a
collection
of
functions
ek
indexed
by
keys
k
mapping
some
set
of
plaintexts
p
to
some
set
of
ciphertexts
c
similarly
the
decryption
system
d
is
a
collection
of
functions
dk
such
that
dkekp
p
for
every
plaintext
p
that
is
succesful
decryption
of
ciphertext
into
plaintext
is
accomplished
using
the
same
key
index
as
was
used
for
the
corresponding
encryption
of
plaintext
into
ciphertext
such
systems
wherein
the
same
key
value
is
used
to
encrypt
and
decrypt
are
also
known
as
symmetric
cryptoystems
what
is
an
attack
in
intuitive
terms
a
passive
attack
on
a
cryptosystem
is
any
method
of
starting
with
some
information
about
plaintexts
and
their
corresponding
ciphertexts
under
some
unknown
key
and
figuring
out
more
information
about
the
plaintexts
its
possible
to
state
mathematically
what
this
means
here
we
go
fix
functions
f
g
and
h
of
n
variables
fix
an
encryption
system
e
and
fix
a
distribution
of
plaintexts
and
keys
an
attack
on
e
using
g
assuming
f
giving
h
with
probability
p
is
an
algorithm
a
with
a
pair
f
g
of
inputs
and
one
output
h
such
that
there
is
probability
p
of
computing
h
if
we
have
f
and
g
note
that
this
probability
depends
on
the
distribution
of
the
vector
the
attack
is
trivial
or
pointless
if
there
is
probability
at
least
p
of
computing
h
if
f
and
g
here
range
uniformly
over
the
possible
ciphertexts
and
have
no
particular
relation
to
in
other
words
an
attack
is
trivial
if
it
doesnt
actually
use
the
encryptions
an
attack
is
called
oneciphertext
if
n
twociphertext
if
n
and
so
on
whats
the
advantage
of
formulating
all
this
mathematically
in
basic
cryptology
you
can
never
prove
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secure
read
part
we
keep
saying
a
strong
cryptosystem
must
have
this
property
but
having
this
property
is
no
guarantee
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
in
contrast
the
purpose
of
mathematical
cryptology
is
to
precisely
formulate
and
if
possible
prove
the
statement
that
a
cryptosystem
is
strong
we
say
for
example
that
a
cryptosystem
is
secure
against
all
passive
attacks
if
any
nontrivial
attack
against
the
system
as
defined
above
is
too
slow
to
be
practical
if
we
can
prove
this
statement
then
we
have
confidence
that
our
cryptosystem
will
resist
any
passive
cryptanalytic
technique
if
we
can
reduce
this
statement
to
some
wellknown
unsolved
problem
then
we
still
have
confidence
that
the
cryptosystem
isnt
easy
to
break
other
parts
of
cryptology
are
also
amenable
to
mathematical
definition
again
the
point
is
to
explicitly
identify
what
assumptions
were
making
and
prove
that
they
produce
the
desired
results
we
can
figure
out
what
it
means
for
a
particular
cryptosystem
to
be
used
properly
it
just
means
that
the
assumptions
are
valid
the
same
methodology
is
useful
for
cryptanalysis
too
the
cryptanalyst
can
take
advantage
of
incorrect
assumptions
often
he
can
try
to
construct
a
proof
of
security
for
a
system
see
where
the
proof
fails
and
use
these
failures
as
the
starting
points
for
his
analysis
why
is
the
onetime
pad
secure
by
definition
the
onetime
pad
is
a
cryptosystem
where
the
plaintexts
ciphertexts
and
keys
are
all
strings
say
byte
strings
of
some
length
m
and
ekp
is
just
the
sum
lets
say
the
exclusive
or
of
k
and
p
it
is
easy
to
prove
mathematically
that
there
are
no
nontrivial
singleciphertext
attacks
on
the
onetime
pad
assuming
a
uniform
distribution
of
keys
note
that
we
dont
have
to
assume
a
uniform
distribution
of
plaintexts
heres
the
proof
let
a
be
an
attack
ie
an
algorithm
taking
two
inputs
f
g
and
producing
one
output
h
with
some
probability
p
that
h
hp
whenever
f
fp
and
g
gekp
ie
g
gk
p
then
because
the
distribution
of
k
is
uniform
and
independent
of
p
the
distribution
of
k
p
must
also
be
uniform
and
independent
of
p
but
also
the
distribution
of
c
is
uniform
and
independent
of
p
hence
there
is
probability
exactly
p
that
h
hp
whenever
f
fp
and
g
gc
over
all
p
and
c
thus
a
fortiori
a
is
trivial
on
the
other
hand
the
onetime
pad
is
not
secure
if
a
key
k
is
used
for
more
than
one
plaintext
ie
there
are
nontrivial
multipleciphertext
attacks
so
to
be
properly
used
a
key
k
must
be
thrown
away
after
one
encryption
the
key
is
also
called
a
pad
this
explains
the
name
onetime
pad
whats
a
ciphertextonly
attack
in
the
notation
above
a
ciphertextonly
attack
is
one
where
f
is
constant
given
only
some
information
about
n
ciphertexts
the
attack
has
to
have
some
chance
of
producing
some
information
about
the
plaintexts
the
attack
is
trivial
if
it
has
just
as
good
a
chance
of
producing
when
given
for
random
for
example
say
gc
c
and
say
hp
is
the
first
bit
of
p
we
can
easily
write
down
an
attackthe
guessing
attack
which
simply
guesses
that
hp
is
this
attack
is
trivial
because
it
doesnt
use
the
ciphertext
it
has
a
fiftyfifty
chance
of
guessing
correctly
no
matter
what
on
the
other
hand
there
is
an
attack
on
rsa
which
produces
one
bit
of
information
about
p
with
success
using
c
if
it
is
fed
a
random
c
then
the
success
rate
drops
to
so
this
is
a
nontrivial
attack
whats
a
knownplaintext
attack
the
classic
knownplaintext
attack
has
and
depending
only
on
in
other
words
given
two
ciphertexts
and
and
one
decryption
the
knownplaintext
attack
should
produce
information
about
the
other
decryption
note
that
knownplaintext
attacks
are
often
defined
in
the
literature
as
producing
information
about
the
key
but
this
is
pointless
the
cryptanalyst
generally
cares
about
the
key
only
insofar
as
it
lets
him
decrypt
further
messages
whats
a
chosenplaintext
attack
a
chosenplaintext
attack
is
the
first
of
an
increasingly
impractical
series
of
active
attacks
on
a
cryptosystem
attacks
where
the
cryptanalyst
feeds
data
to
the
encryptor
these
attacks
dont
fit
into
our
model
of
passive
attacks
explained
above
anyway
a
chosenplaintext
attack
lets
the
cryptanalyst
choose
a
plaintext
and
look
at
the
corresponding
ciphertext
then
repeat
until
he
has
figured
out
how
to
decrypt
any
message
more
absurd
examples
of
this
sort
of
attack
are
the
chosenkey
attack
and
chosensystem
attack
a
much
more
important
form
of
active
attack
is
a
message
corruption
attack
where
the
attacker
tries
to
change
the
ciphertext
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
a
useful
change
in
the
plaintext
there
are
many
easy
ways
to
throw
kinks
into
all
of
these
attacks
for
instance
automatically
encrypting
any
plaintext
p
as
tekhtrprp
where
t
is
a
timekey
sequence
number
chosen
anew
for
each
message
r
is
a
random
number
and
h
is
a
oneway
hash
function
here
comma
means
concatenation
and
plus
means
exclusiveor
in
mathematical
terms
what
can
you
say
about
bruteforce
attacks
consider
the
following
knownplaintext
attack
we
are
given
some
plaintexts
and
ciphertexts
were
also
given
a
ciphertext
cn
we
run
through
every
key
k
when
we
find
k
such
that
ekpi
ci
for
every
i
n
we
print
dkcn
if
n
is
big
enough
that
only
one
key
works
this
attack
will
succeed
on
valid
inputs
all
the
time
while
it
will
produce
correct
results
only
once
in
a
blue
moon
for
random
inputs
thus
this
is
a
nontrivial
attack
its
only
problem
is
that
it
is
very
slow
if
there
are
many
possible
keys
whats
a
keyguessing
attack
whats
entropy
say
somebody
is
using
the
onetime
padbut
isnt
choosing
keys
randomly
and
uniformly
from
all
mbit
messages
as
he
was
supposed
to
for
our
security
proof
in
fact
say
hes
known
to
prefer
keys
which
are
english
words
then
a
cryptanalyst
can
run
through
all
english
words
as
possible
keys
this
attack
will
often
succeed
and
its
much
faster
than
a
bruteforce
search
of
the
entire
keyspace
we
can
measure
how
bad
a
key
distribution
is
by
calculating
its
entropy
this
number
e
is
the
number
of
real
bits
of
information
of
the
key
a
cryptanalyst
will
typically
happen
across
the
key
within
guesses
e
is
defined
as
the
sum
of
pk
pk
where
pk
is
the
probability
of
key
k
