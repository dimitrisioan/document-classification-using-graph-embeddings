the

that

vary

possibilities
so
that
anyone
trying

break
the
encryption
by
brute
force
need
only
plow
through
the
possible
serial
numbers
about
one
billion
multiplied
by
the
number
of
different
combinations
iff
the
phones
transmit
their
serial
nos
as
part

the

then
what
is
to
say
that
each
phone
can
take
that
serial
number
and
use
it
to
generate
the
required
key
