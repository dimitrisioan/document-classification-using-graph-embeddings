IDEAS
ON
CLIPPER
I
HAVE
AN
IDEA
AS
TO
WHY
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
NEEDS
TO
BE
KEEP
SECRET
AND
SOME
THINGS
THAT
I
THINK
IT
IMPLIES
OF
COURSE
THESE
COULD
ALL
BE
WRONG
FROM
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
A
TECHNICAL
SUMMARY
DOROTHY
DENNING
REVISED
APRIL
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
CONTAINS
A
CLASSIFIED
SINGLEKEY
BLOCK
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
CALLED
SKIPJACK
THE
ALGORITHM
USES
BIT
KEYS
COMPARED
WITH
FOR
THE
DES
AND
HAS
ROUNDS
OF
SCRAMBLING
COMPARED
WITH
FOR
THE
DES
IT
SUPPORTS
ALL
DES
MODES
OF
OPERATION
THE
ALGORITHM
TAKES
CLOCK
TICKS
AND
IN
ELECTRONIC
CODEBOOK
ECB
MODE
RUNS
AT
MBITS
PER
SECOND
EACH
CHIP
INCLUDES
THE
FOLLOWING
COMPONENTS
THE
SKIPJACK
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
F
AN
FAMILY
KEY
THAT
IS
COMMON
TO
ALL
CHIPS
N
A

THIS

AN

UNLOCKS
ALL
MESSAGES
ENCRYPTED
WITH

ENCRYPTING
WITH
THE
CHIP
TO
SEE
HOW
THE
CHIP
IS
USED
IMAGINE
THAT
IT
IS
EMBEDDED
IN
THE
ATT
TELEPHONE
SECURITY
DEVICE
AS
IT
WILL
BE
SUPPOSE
I
CALL
SOMEONE
AND
WE
BOTH
HAVE
SUCH
A
DEVICE
AFTER
PUSHING
A
BUTTON
TO
START
A
SECURE
CONVERSATION
MY
SECURITY
DEVICE
WILL
NEGOTIATE
AN
SESSION
KEY
K
WITH
THE
DEVICE
AT
THE
OTHER
END
THIS
KEY
NEGOTIATION
TAKES
PLACE
WITHOUT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
GENERAL
ANY
METHOD
OF
KEY
EXCHANGE
CAN
BE
USED
SUCH
AS
THE
DIFFIEHELLMAN
PUBLICKEY
DISTRIBUTION
METHOD
ONCE
THE

ESTABLISHED
THE

THE

SECURITY

FEEDS

A

WHICH
ARE
TRANSMITTED
OVER

THE

THUS
CONTAINS
THE

ENCRYPTED

CONCATENATED

F
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
FIELD
IS
DECRYPTED
BY
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AFTER
AN
AUTHORIZED
WIRETAP
HAS
BEEN
INSTALLED
SUPPOSE
I
KNEW
HOW
THE
ALGORITHM
WORKED
AND
KNEW
THE
N
FOR
MY
CHIP
BUT
DID
NOT
KNOW
F
THEN
BY
CRYPTANALYSIS
I
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
DETERMINE
F
FROM
IF
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
FIELD
EEK
U
N
F
NOT
KNOWING
N
WOULD
MIGHT
MAKE
THIS
MUCH
HARDER
NOW
SUPPOSE
THAT
I
KNOW
F
EITHER
LEGITIMATELY
OR
NOT
IF
I
KNOW
K
EITHER
BECAUSE
I
AM
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CONVERSATION
OR
I
KNOW
U
FOR
A
PARTY
IN
THE
CONVERSATION
I
MAY
NOW
BE
ABLE
TO
DETERMINE
U
FOR
THE
OTHER
PARTY
IF
I
KNOW
F
I
CAN
ALSO
DEFEAT
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
FIELD
SINCE
I
COULD
MAKE
MY
OWN
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
K
THEN
THE
ONE
I
AM
USING
KNOWING
F
ALSO
ALLOWS
TRAFFIC
ANALYSIS
TO
BE
PERFORMED
SO
I
MIGHT
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
BUT
I
COULD
KNOW
WHO
YOU
ARE
SAYING
IT
TOO
NOW
I
ADMIT
THAT
SOMEONE
TRYING
TO
COMPUTE
U
WILL
NOT
HAVE
LOTS
OF
MESSAGES
TO
WORK
FROM
BUT
SINCE
WE
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
THAT
THE
KEY
GENERATION
METHOD
DOES
NOT
DELIBERATELY
GENERATE
WEAK
KEYS
OR
FOR
THAT
MATTER
THAT
THE
PUBLISHED
METHOD
IS
IN
FACT
USED
PERHAPS
THE
US
WILL
BE
CHOSEN
FROM
KNOW
WEAK
KEYS
FOR
THE
SYSTEM
OBVIOUSLY
THE
COMPROMISE
OF
F
WOULD
BE
A
DISASTER
BOTH
TO
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
FOR
WHOM
THIS
WHOLE
THING
IS
DESIGNED
AND
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
GIVING
THEM
SECURITY
F
IS
BUT
ONE
NUMBER
AND
I
SURE
THAT
ALOT
OF
PEOPLE
MORE
THEN
KNOW
WHAT
IT
IS
AND
IF
SOME
PANEL
OF
EXPERTS
IS
GOING
TO
CHECK
IT
OVER
FOR
FLAWS
THEN
MANY
MORE
WILL
KNOW
F
FORGET
GRINDING
CHIPS
BRIBERY
AND
BLACKMAIL
WORK
JUST
FINE
SO
AM
I
WRONG
OR
ARE
THESE
PROBLEMS
