how

encrypted
data
towards
bit
errors
how
much
data
per
bit
will
be
lost
in
average
i
assume
you
still
have
the
correct
key
it
depends
on
the
mode
youre
using
for
a
single
input
block
a
onebit
error
will
have
a
percent
chance
of
corrupting
each
of
the
output
bits
in
other
words
it
essentially
turns
the
output
block
into
a
random
number
if
youre
encrypting
data
in
cbc
mode
however
only
the
one
block
will
be
affected
the
next
block
and
all
that
follow
it
will
be
decrypted
properly
its
a
good
idea
to
have
some
kind
of
error
correction
in
your
system
if
corrupted
bits
are
likely
