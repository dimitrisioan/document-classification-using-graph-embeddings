TAL
KUBO
WRITES
HAVING
MENTIONED
THE
POSSIBLE
DANGERS
OF
UNWELCOME
POLITICAL
ASSOCIATIONS
I
WOULD
BE
REMISS
NOT
TO
SUGGEST
SOMETHING
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
GATHERING
THE
SUPPORT
OF
THE
NRA
BY
EMPHASIZING
THE
RKBA
SIDE
OF
THE

AS

THE

HMMM
THIS
GAVE
ME
AN
INTERESTING
IDEA
HOW
ABOUT
THIS
ARGUMENT
SECOND
AMENDMENT
GIVES
US
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS
ARMS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
THATS
WHY
ITS
SO
HARD
TO
EXPORT
THEREFORE
WE
HAVE
A
CONSTITUITIONAL
RIGHT
TO
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
QED
HOWEVER
ITS
LIKELY
TO
BE
AS
HARD
OR
HARDER
TO
EXERCISE
THIS
RIGHT
AS
IT
IS
GETTING
TO
EXERCISE
THE
OTHER
RIGHTS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
SLOWLY
RESTRICTING
MAYBE
THE
NRA
WOULD
BE
THE
BEST
EXISTING
ORGANIZATION
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
A
NEW
ONE
MIGHT
BE
BETTER
BUT
PERHAPS
WOULD
TAKE
TOO
LONG
TO
START
UP
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
JOIN
