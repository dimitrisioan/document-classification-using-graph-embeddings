actually
i
am
completely
baffled
by
why
dorothy
denning
has
chosen
to
throw
away
her
academic
respectability
like
this
it
looks
to
me
like
a
major
career
limiting
move
there
can
be
very
few
people
who
know
what
shes
been
saying
who
take
her
seriously
any
more
actually
ive
been
following
her
remarks
for
some
time
with
interest
im
also
a
member
of
academia
and
her
remarks
have
nothing
but
elevate
her
respectability
in
my
eyes
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
you
are
the
radical
fringe
or
i
it
is
generally
an
error
to
assume
that
your
beliefs
are
held
by
the
majority
or
even
a
sizable
minority
especially
when
youre
seeing
tens
nay
dozens
of
people
on
usenet
agreeing
with
you
