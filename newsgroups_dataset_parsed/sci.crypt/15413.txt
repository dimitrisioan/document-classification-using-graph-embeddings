AND
PASSWORDS
I
AM
POSTIVE
SOMEONE
WILL
CORRECT
ME
IF
I
AM
WRONG
BUT
DOESNT
THE
FIFTH
ALSO
COVER
NOT

I
AM

THAT
MIKE
IS
CORRECT
ON
THIS
POINT
I
AM
ALSO
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
ADMINISTERING
TRUTH
SERUM
WOULD
BE
RULED
A
VIOLATION
OF
YOUR
RIGHT
NOT
TO
INCRIMINATE
YOURSELF
BUT
WHAT
IS
THE
SALIENT
DIFFERENCE
BOTH
DRAWING
BLOOD
AND
INJECTING
TRUTH
SERUM
INCAPACITATE
YOU
FOR
A
WHILE
BUT
DO
NO
PERMANENT
DAMAGE
IS
IT
SIMPLY
THAT
WE
HAVE
COME
TO
VIEW
ONE
AS
ACCEPTABLE
WHILE
THE
OTHER
IS
VIEWED
AS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
VIOLATION
OF

IF
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
HOW
DO
WE
EXPAND
