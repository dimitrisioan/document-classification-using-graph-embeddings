answer
for
those
of
you
looking
for
information
on
msdos
file
system
compression
api
today
i
called
microsofts
dos
hotline
at
they
told
me
that
the
dos
resource
kit
had
the
specifications
for
the
compression
interface
the
resource
kit
costs
plus
tax
and
shipping
i
ordered
a
copy
and
will
post
further
when
i
get
it
and
know
more
about
it
i
am
posting
now
because
the
order
turnaround
is
working
days
if
anyone
knows
for
sure
wheres
theres
a
good
source
of
info
on
this
api
please
speak
up
i
am
slightly
skeptical
about
the
resource
kits
likelihood
of
having
detailed
programming
info
mark
r
mrrripemmsuedu
posted
also
to
scicrypt
since
the

could
presumably
also
be
used
for
file
system
encryption
