DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WRITES
THOUGH
SOME
MAY
ARGUE
ABOUT
THE
NOSE
OF
THE
CAMEL
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROPOSAL
IS
LIMITED
TO
SCRAMBLED
TELEPHONY
IF
IT
IS
ONLY
USED
FOR
THAT
PURPOSE
AND
DOES
NOT
EXTEND
TO
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
OR
FILE
ENCRYPTION
THEN
IT
IS
AN
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THE
CURRENT
MASSPRODUCED
STANDARD
CIVILIAN
TECHNOLOGY
WHICH
WITH
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONS
IS
LIMITED

THERE
ARE
STRONG
HINTS
IN

TO
A

NETWORK
IS
THAT
THEY
INTEND
IT
TO
BE
USED
IN
EXCLUSION
TO
ANY
OTHER
MEANS
OF
ENCRYPTION
DONT
BE
LULLED
BY
THE
WEDGE
BECAUSE
ITS
