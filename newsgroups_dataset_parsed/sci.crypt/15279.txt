the
actual
algorithm
is
classified
however
their
main
thrust
here
is
for
cellular
phones
and
encryption
is
only
over
the
radio
end
not
end
to
end
i
think
end
to
end
will
come
later
encrypting
just
the
radio
link
doesnt
make
sense
to
me
that
means
the
telco
has
to
do
the
decryption
and
hence
they
need
the
keys
how
are
they
going
to
be
kept
secure
