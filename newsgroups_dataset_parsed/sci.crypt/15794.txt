remember
that
theyve
promised
to
let
a
committee
of
outside
experts
see
the
cryptosystem
design
i
hope
there
are
some
silicon
jocks
on
the
committee
who
can
follow
the
algorithm
through
to
hardware
while
i
doubt
the
nsa
would
pull
any
monkey
business
on
this
point
they
have
to
expect
that
the
chip
will
be
reverseengineered
sooner
or
later
its
an
obvious
opportunity
to
introduce
additional
holes
the
chip
isnt
the
place
to
pull
the
monkey
business
you
do
it
in
the
key
generation
either
by
having
a
mathematical
backdoor
or
by
having
the
program
on
the
laptop
that
supposedly
generates
the
keys
also
save
a
copy
of
and
and
leak
it
out
somehow
or
by
having
the
program
that
supposedly
puts
the
official
keys
on
the
chip
actually
put
a
different
key
there
very
hard
to
detect
since
the
escrow
agents
have
to
either
trust
the
nsa
laptop
or
give
each
other
the
s
keys
and
they
still
dont
know
the
algorithm
or
have
the
chipburner
at
the
factory
make
copies
of
the
keys
or
whatever
pray
for
peace
