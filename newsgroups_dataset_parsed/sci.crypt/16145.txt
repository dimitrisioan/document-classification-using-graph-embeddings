WRITES
YOU
ALL
MENTION
THAT
THE
ALGORITHM
IS
CLASSIFIED
AND
HAVE
EXPRESSED
CONCERNS
AND
IDEAS
OF
HOW
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THE
ALGORITHM
USING
SOFTWARE
THE
QUESTION
THAT
I
HAVE
IS
WHY
CANT
SOMEONE
TAKE
ONE
OF
THESE
CHIPS
AND
REVERSE
ENGINEER
IT
I
MEAN
TAKE
THE
THING
TO
A
CHIP
TESTING
ANALYSIS
FACILITY
ONE
WITH
A
DECENT
ELECTRON
MICROSCOPE
JUST
PRY
OFF
THE
TOP
OF
THE
CHIP
AND
START
SCANNING
IT
WITH
THE
ELECTRON
MICROCOPE
AND
FIGURE
OUT
THE
CIRCUITRY
I
REMEMBERED
A
PLACE
THAT
I
USE
TO
WORK
FOR
HAD
ONE
OF
THESE
FACILITIES
THAT
THEY
USED
TO
ANALYZE
CHIPS
THAT
WE
ACCIDENTLY
BLEW
OUT
WHILE
RUNNING
TESTS
THEY
COULD
ACTUALLY
FIND
THE
AREA
THAT
WAS
FRIED
AND
SHOW
US
WHERE
IN
THE
CIRCUIT
IT
WAS
I
AM
SURE
THAT
MANY
COMPANIES
AND
UNIVERSITIES
MUST
HAVE
THESE
FACILITIES
AND
THAT
THE
POTENTIAL
IS
THERE
ESPECIALLY
AT
A
UNIVERSITY
WHERE
THE
SECURITY
AT
SUCH
A
FACILITY
IS
LOOSER
FOR
SOMEONE
TO
TAKE
A
CLIPPER
APART
AND
ANALYZE
IT
WHAT
CAN
THE
GOVERNMENT
DO
TO
PREVENT
THIS
START
TAKING
AWAY
ALL
MICROCHIP
ANALYSIS
FACILITIES
AND
ELECTRON
MICROSCOPES
THEY
ARE
USING
SOME
TECHNOLOGY
DEVELOPED
BY
VLSI
SYSTEMS
THE
OTHER
MANUFACTURER
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIPS
THAT
PRODUCES
CHIPS
THAT
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
HIGHLY
RESISTANT

REVERSE
