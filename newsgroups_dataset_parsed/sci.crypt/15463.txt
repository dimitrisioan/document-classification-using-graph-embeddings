HAVE
YOU
READ
THE
APPLICABLE
PART
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
INTERPRETED
IT
IN
CONTEXT
IF
NOT
PLEASE
DO
SO
BEFORE
POSTING
THIS
MISINTERPRETATION
AGAIN
IT
REFERS
TO
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
TO
ORGANIZE
A
MILITIA
NOT
FOR
INDIVIDUALS
TO
CARRY
HANDGUNS
GRENADES
AND
ASSAULT

THE
SUPREME
COURT
SEEMS
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
THEY
HAVE
STATED
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
IS
A
TERM
OF
ART
REFERING
TO
AN
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHT
AND
HAVE
EXPLICITLY
MENTIONED
THE
SECOND

AS
AN
EXAMPLE
I
QUOTE
THE

EMPLOYED
IN

V
UERDUGOURIQUIDEZ
FURTHERMORE
IN
THE
MILLER
DECISION
THEY
ONLY
PERMITTED
PROSECUTION
FOR
POSSESSION
OF
A
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUN
BECAUSE
THE
DEFENSE
HAD
NOT
PRESENTED
TESTIMONY
AND
THEY
THEREFORE
ACCEPTED
THE
ARGUMENT
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
THAT
SUCH
WEAPONS
HAVE
NO
MILITARY
VALUE
THEY
HELD
THAT
THE
AMENDMENT
PROTECTED
THE
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHT
TO
POSSESS
MILITARY
WEAPONS
UNFORTUNATELY
NO
SECOND
AMENDMENT
CASE
HAS
SUCCESSFULLY
GOTTEN
TO
THE
COURT
IN
FIFTY
YEARS
HOWEVER
THAT
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
THE
INTERPRETATION
FURTHERMORE
IT
APPEARS
THAT
OTHERS
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
AS
WELL
VIS
THE
CONCLUSION
IS
THUS
INESCAPABLE
THAT
THE
HISTORY
CONCEPT
AND
WORDING
OF
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
TO
THE
CONSTITUTION
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
AS
WELL
AS
ITS
INTERPRETATION
BY
EVERY
MAJOR
COMMENTATOR
AND
COURT
IN
THE
FIRST
HALFCENTURY
AFTER
ITS
RATIFI
CATION
INDICATES
THAT
WHAT
IS
PROTECTED
IS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHT
OF
A
PRIVATE
CITIZEN
TO
OWN
AND
CARRY
FIREARMS
IN
A
PEACEFUL
MANNER

OF
THE
SUBCOMMITTEE

THE
COMMITTEE

JUDICIARY

SENATE
CONGRESS
SECOND
SESSION
FEBRUARY
YOU
MIGHT
RIGHTFULLY
ASK
WELL
THEN
WHAT
DOES
THAT
FIRST
BIT
ABOUT
MILITIAS
MEAN
WELL
MILITIA
IN
HISTORICAL
CONTEXT
BASICALLY
MEANS
THE
WHOLE
OF
THE
ADULT
MALES
OF
THE
COUNTRY
INDEED
THE
US
CODE
STILL
DEFINES
MILITIA
AS
ALL
ARMED
MEN
OVER
THE
AGE
OF
THE
MILITIA
COMPRISED
ALL
MALES
PHYSICALLY
CAPABLE
OF
ACTING
IN
CONCERT
FOR
THE
COMMON
DEFENSE
AND
THESE
MEN
WERE
EXPECTED
TO
APPEAR
BEARING
ARMS
SUPPLIED
BY
THEMSELVES
AND
OF
THE
KIND
IN
COMMON
USE
AT
THE
TIME
SUPREME
COURT
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
US
V
MILLER
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
PHRASE
BEING
THERE
WAS
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
RATIONALE
BEHIND
THE
AMENDMENT
WHICH
WAS
THIS
BY
DEPENDING
ON
THE
PEOPLE
TO
BEAR
ARMS
IN
DEFENSE
OF
THE
COUNTRY
NO
CENTRALIZATION
OF
MILITARY
POWER
COULD
EVER
OCCUR
WHICH
WOULD
PERMIT
TYRANNY
IN
SHORT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WOULD
REMAIN
PERPETUALLY
IN
FEAR
OF
THE
PEOPLE
RATHER
THAN
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
NO
FREE
MAN
SHALL
EVER
BE
DEBARRED
THE
USE
OF
ARMS
THE
STRONGEST
REASON
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
TO
RETAIN
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
IS
AS
A
LAST
RESORT
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES

TYRANNY

ISNT
THERE
