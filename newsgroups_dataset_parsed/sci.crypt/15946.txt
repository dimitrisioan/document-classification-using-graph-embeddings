it
is
unclear
whether
obtaining
the
key
at
time
also
unlocks
messages
recorded
by
whomever
at
earlier
times
the
announcement
was
silent
on
this
the
betting
seems
to
be
that
once
your
key
has
been
obtained
by
the
authorities
by
divorce
lawyers
by
the
mafia
by
the
fbi
by
lost
or
stolen
backup
tapes
by
the
nsa
etc
all
previous
conversations
are
unsecure
session
keys
are
negotiated
but
knowing
the
private
key
is
believed
by
many
commentators
here
to
break
the
security
no
doubt
more
details
will
emerge
it
is
completely
clear
you
have
to
assume
that
each
byte
that
was
encrypted
by
this
clipper
chip
has
been
compromised
some
people
wondered
why
denning
hellman
and
others
did
not
respond
when
asked
what
would
be
done
about
such
compromised
phones
or
if
compromise
could
not
be
restricted
in
time
i
did
too
let
us
just
assume
that
a
they
do
not
know
and
b
those
who
know
dont
tell
and
c
they
do
not
care
it
seems
to
be
an
other
persons
problem
gec
instruments
register
only
through
things
theyre
designed
to
register
space
still
contains
infinite
unknowns
