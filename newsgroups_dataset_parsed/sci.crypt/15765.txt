writes
at
the
company
i
worked
for
previously
i
received
a
file
that
was
des
encryped
and
the
person
that
had
sent
it
went
on
vaction
rather
than
wait
two
weeks
i
set
up
a
straight
frontal
attack
with
one
key
at
a
time
it
only
took
days
to
crack
the
file
no
i
dont
have
any
faith
in
des
taking
this
at
face
value
though
it
seems
quite
dissonant
with
much
else
that
has
been
published
here
about
brute
force
des
cracking
unless
russell
was
lucky
with
respect
to
the
key
id
be
very
interested
in
whether
the
program
russell
used
is
available
key
search
is
very
practical
in
many
real
situations
since
people
use
such
stupid
keys
on
the
average
password
crackers
know
this
well
depending
on
his
answer
this
could
be
an
appalling
development
calling
into
question
both
des
and
rsades
not
really
in
fact
public
key
based
communication
systems
very
often
pick
keys
automatically
which
are
much
better
than
passwords
or
pass
phrases
if
any
bright
programmer
with
a
little
idle
machine
time
can
crack
a
single
des
message
in
a
couple
of
days
assuming
no
tricks
that
are
messagespecific
if
a
person
picked
the
password
or
pass
phrase
then
the
key
search
is
pretty
straightforward
in
running
english
text
the
average
content
of
a
single
word
is
about
bits
in
pass
phrases
this
may
increase
to
bits
or
so
searching
spaces
is
semipractical
even
in
software
and
searching
spaces
isnt
outrageous
to
imagine
with
hardware
assists
of
moderate
size
