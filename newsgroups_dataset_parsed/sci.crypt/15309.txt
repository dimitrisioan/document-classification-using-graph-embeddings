BRAD
TEMPLETON
WRITES
THE
GREATEST
DANGER
OF
THE
ESCROW
DATABASE
IF
IT
WERE
KEPT
ON
DISK
WOULD
BE
THE
CHANCE
THAT
A
COMPLETE
COPY
COULD
SOMEHOW
LEAK
OUT
YOU
OF
COURSE
THEN
ITS
HARD
TO
BACKUP
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
NO
BACKUP
THE
DATA
IS
NOT
THERE
WHEN
A
WARRANT
COMES
ARE
WORSE
THAN
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
A
SECRET
BACKUP
IF
THE
DATA
ISNT
THERE
WHEN
THE
WARRANT
COMES
YOU
EFFECTIVELY
HAVE
SECURE
CRYPTO
IF
SECRET
BACKUPS
ARE
KEPTTHEN
YOU
EFFECTIVELY
HAVE
NO
CRYPTO
THUS
THIS
POSTER
IS
ESSENTIALY
ARGUING
NO
CRYPTO
IS
BETTER
THAN
SECURE
CRYPTO
IF
THE
DATA
ISNT
THERE
WHEN
THE
WARRANT
COMES
THEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
JUST
HAVE
TO
USE
NORMAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
TECHNIQUES
TO
CATCH
CROOKS
IS
THIS
SO
BAD
BTW
BUGGING
ISNT
YET
A
NORMAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
TECHNIQUE
WITH
THE
PRIVACY
CLIPPER
IT
WILL
BECOME
A
NORMAL
TECHNIQUE
