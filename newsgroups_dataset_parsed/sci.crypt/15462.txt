THE
ESCROW
DATABASE
HERE
IS
A
DISTURBING
THOUGHT
NOW
WE
NO
LONGER
LIVE
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
BIG
FILING
CABINETS
WE
LIVE
IN
THE
ELECTRONIC
AGE
I
ASKED
MYSELF
HOW
BIG
COULD
THE
ESCROW
DATABASE
GET
HOW
HARD
MIGHT
IT
BE
TO
STEAL
THE
WHOLE
THING
PARTICULARLY
WERE
I
AN
NSA
OFFICIAL
OPERATING
WITH
THE
TACIT
PERMISSION
OF
THE
ESCROW
HOUSES
WE
CAN
PRETEND
THAT
SUCH
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
BUT
THATS
NAIVE
WELL
LETS
SEE
TEN
BYTES
OF
EACH
ESCROW
HALF
LETS
ASUME
TEN
BYTES
OF
SERIAL
NUMBER
IN
FACT
I
BELIEVE
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
IS
SMALLER
BUT
THIS
IS
AN
ORDER
OF
MAGNITUDE
CALCULATION
WE
ASSUME
AS
THE
POPULATION
AND
THAT
EACH
PERSON
HAS
A
KEY
I
GET
FIVE
GIGABYTES
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
TWO
ESCROW
DATABASES
FITS
CONVENIENTLY
ON
A
SINGLE
VERY
VALUABLE
EXABYTE
TAPE
THIS
CAN
ONLY
GET
EASIER
WITH
TIME
BUT
WHO
CARES
I
CAN
ALREADY
HOLD
ALL
THE
CLIPPER
KEYS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
IN
MY
POCKET
ON
TWO
TAPES
ADMITTELY
THEY
WILL
THINK
OF
SAFEGUARDS
THEY
WONT
PUT
THE
WHOLE
DATABASE
ON
ONE
DISK
PREHAPS
MAYBE
THEY
WILL
THROW
STUMBLING
BLOCKS
IN
THE
WAY
THIS
CHANGES
NOTHING
THEY
KEYS
WILL
BE
NEEDED
EVERY
DAY
BY
HUNDREDS
IF
NOT
THOUSANDS
OF
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
TYPES
SO
CONVENIENCE
WILL
DICTATE
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
PERMIT
QUICK
ELECTRONIC
RETRIEVAL
AT
SOME
POINT
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
COLLUSION
BY
THE
AGENCIES
THOSE
EXABYTE
TAPES
ARE
GOING
TO
GET
CUT
DOROTHY
DENNING
AND
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WILL
DOUBTLESS
CLAIM
THIS
CANT
HAPPEN
BUT
WE
KNOW
THAT
CANT
IS
A
PRAYER
NOT
A
WORD
THAT
IN
THIS
INSTANCE
CONNOTES
REALISM
WITH
TWO
EXABYTE
TAPES
IN
YOUR
POCKET
YOU
WOULD
HOLD
THE
KEYS
FOR
EVERY
PERSONS
CONVERSATIONS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
IN
YOUR
HANDS
YEAH
YOU
NEED
THE
MASTER
KEY
TWO
BUT
THATS
JUST
TEN
BYTES
OF
INFORMATION
THAT
HAVE
TO
BE
STORED
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
PLACES
COME
TO
THINK
OF
IT
EVEN
IF
THE
NSA
GETTING
A
COPY
OF
THE
DATABASE
ISNT
A
THREAT
TO
YOU
BECAUSE
UNLIKE
ME
YOU
HAVE
NO
CONTRAVERSIAL
POLITICAL
VIEWS
CONSIDER
FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES
YOU
KNOW
THE
ONES
THAT
DAVID
STERNLIGHT
WANTS
TO
PROTECT
US
FROM
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EVIL
INDUSTRIAL
ESPIONAGE
THAT
THEY
DO
THE
FRENCH
APPARENTLY
DO
HAVE
A
BIG
SPYING
OPERATION
IN
FRIENDLY
COUNTRIES
TO
GET
INDUSTRIAL
SECRETS
SO
HE
ISNT
BEING
COMPLETELY
IRRATIONAL
HERE
ALTHOUGH
WHY
OUR
COMPANIES
COULDNT
USE
CRYPTOSYSTEMS
WITHOUT
BACK
DOORS
IS
LEFT
UNEXPLAINED
BY
THOSE
THAT
POINT
OUT
THIS
THREAT
PRESUMABLY
FOREIGN
INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES
CAN
GET
MOLES
INTO
THE
NSA
AND
OTHER
AGENCIES
WE
HAVE
PROOF
BY
EXAMPLE
OF
THIS
ITS
HAPPENED
MANY
TIMES
PRESUMABLY
SOMEDAY
THEY
WILL
GET
THEIR
HANDS
ON
SOME
FRACTION
OF
THE
KEYS
YOU
CANT
AVOID
THAT
SORT
OF
THING
DONT
PRETEND
THAT
NO
ONE
UNAUTHORIZED
WILL
EVER
GET
THEIR
HANDS
ON
THE
ESCROW
DATABASES
WE
CRYPTO
TYPES
ARE
ALL
TAUGHT
SOMETHING
VERY
IMPORTANT
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
INTRO
TO
CRYPTOGRAPHY
SECURITY
MUST
DEPEND
ON
THE
EASILY
CHANGED
KEY
THAT
YOU
PICK
TO
RUN
YOUR
SYSTEM
AND
NOT
ON
A
SECRET
THE
ESCROW
DATABASES
ARENT
THE
SORTS
OF
SECRETS
THAT
OUR
TEACHERS
TOLD
US
ABOUT
BUT
THEY
ARE
THE
SORT
OF
BIG
SECRETS
THEY
WOULD
LUMP
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
IMAGINE
TRYING
TO
REPLACE
MILLION
CLIPPER
CHIPS
I
CANNOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
NSA
OR
WHOMEVER
IT
IS
THATS
DOING
THIS
DOESNT
REALIZE
ALL
THIS
ALREADY
THEY
ARE
TOO
SMART
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
OF
THEM
WHO
HAVE
MADE
THEIR
BONES
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THEY
KNOW
PRECISELY
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
AND
THAT
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
IS
GIVING
US
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
SAFETY
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
CONTINUE
TO
SURVEIL
IN
SPITE
OF
THE
GROWTH
OF
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THEY
REALIZE
THAT
THEY
CANT
PUT
THINGS
OFF
FOREVER
BUT
THEY
CAN
TRY
TO
DELAY
THINGS
AS
LONG
AS
POSSIBLE
WHO
KNOWS
MAYBE
EVEN
SOME
OF
THE
HIGHER
UPS
THE
INEVITABLE
BUREAUCRATIC
TYPES
THAT
RISE
IN
ANY
ORGANIZATION
REALLY
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
SCHEME
MIGHT
GIVE
PEOPLE
SOME
SECURITY
EVEN
AS
THEIR
SUBORDINATES
IN
