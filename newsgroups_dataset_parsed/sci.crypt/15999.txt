this

will
also
be
available
via

transfer
from
csrcncslnistgov
in

pubnistnews
and
via
the
nist
computer
security
bbs
at
the
white
house
i
havent
been
able
to
open
an
ftp
session
with
that
machine
operating
under
the
assumption
that
the
address
was
wrong
i
tried
using
nslookup

nicnamewhois

thats
all
i
could
find
about

and
i
tried
an
mx
lookup
on
the
machine
in
question
which
failed
nicnamewhois
domain
lookups
at
both
registries
failed
too
so
i
thought
hey
im
just
not
using
the
tools
right
and
tried
calling
the
bbs
number
no
answer
im
probably
doing
something
wrongor
perhaps
the
machine
has
been
put
behind
a
firewall
but
it
does
look
like
csrcncslnistgov
has
become
an
unmachine
if
someone
would
try
ftping
to
it
or
knows
whats
up
id
really
appreciate
the
info
