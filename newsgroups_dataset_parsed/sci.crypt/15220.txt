how
do
they
know
what
keys
to
ask
for
re
clipper
this
may
be
a
stupid
question
but
how
does
the
government
know
which
keys
to
ask
for
will
owners
be
required
to
register
their
phones
faxes
modems
etc
and
inform
the
government
when
they
are
moved
to
a
different
phone
number
will
there
be
penalities
if
the
public
does
not
do
this
will
identification
the
national
health
care
id
perhaps
be
required
when
purchasing
a
clipperequipted
phone
or
will
each
chip
transmit
identifying
information
at
the
start
of
a
conversation
identification
which
could
be
used
to
automatically
log
who
calls
whom
the
phone
company
keeps
records
but
this
information
would
be
accessable
by
a
wellplaced
van
near
a
microwave
relay
station
this
raises
the
question
of
how
the
two
phones
agree
on
a
communications
encryption
key
will
it
be
something
that
is
derived
from
information
exchanged
at
the
start
of
the
conversation
and
hence
derivable
by
an
eavesdropper
