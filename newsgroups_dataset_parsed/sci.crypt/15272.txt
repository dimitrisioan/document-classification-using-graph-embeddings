ROBERT
LEWIS
GLENDENNING
WRITES
I
HAVE
BEEN
CHIDED
FOR
STATING
THAT
DORTHY
DENNING
WAS
INTELLECTUALLY
DISHONEST
IN
THE
ACM
DEBATE
AND
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
I
HAVE
PREVIOUSLY
REFRAINED
FROM
SUGGESTING
THAT
SHE
IS
ARGUING
ON
BEHALF
OF
CONSULTING
CLIENTS
NOW
I
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
DORTHY
DENNING
HAS
BEEN
FUNCTIONING
AS
A
LOBBYIST
NOT
A
COMPUTER
SCIENTIST
SHE
HAS
USED
LEGAL
ETHICS
TRUTH
IS
WHAT
YOU
CAN
CONVINCE
ANYONE
OF
NOT
SCIENTIFIC
ETHICS
TRUTH
IS
UNDERSTANDING
THE
EXTERNAL
WORLD
MAYBE
WE
CAN
REVOKE
HER
ACM
MEMBERSHIP
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
REFRAIN
FROM
SUCH
INSULTS
UNLESS
AND
UNTIL
YOU
CAN
PRODUCE
SOME
EVIDENCE
TO
BACK
UP
THAT
CLAIM
GIVEN
THE
MEASURES
PROPOSED
OR
PASSED
IN
THE
LAST
YEAR
OR
SO
SUCH
AS
AND
THE
SCANNER
BAN
HER
PROPOSAL
NEED
NOT
BE
ANY
MORE
THAN
HER
OWN
ATTEMPT
AT
A
TECHNICAL
SOLUTION
ITS
ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE
IN
FACT
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
NOTION
OF
SPLITTING
THE
KEY
WHICH
CAME
UP
IN
THE
DEBATE
THAT
SOFTENED
THIS
PROPOSAL
