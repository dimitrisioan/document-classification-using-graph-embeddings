nothing
was
said
about
where
kp
comes
from
oh
hellman
said
each
user
will
get
to
choose
his
or
her
own
key
thats
the
key
which
i
called
kp
the
session
key
according
to
hellman
if
alice
and
bob
are
communicating
with
the
clipper
chip
then
alice
chooses
her
own
key
and
bob
chooses
his
own
key
this
is
incompatible
with
the
suggestion
that
when
alice
and
bob
are
talking
they
use
a
common
kp
chosen
by
classical
or
publickey
approaches
the
protocolkeymanagement
description
published
so
far
is
either
incomplete
or
incorrect
it
leaves
me
with
no
idea
of
how
the
system
would
actually
work
i
hope
the
cpsr
foia
request
succeeds
so
that
we
get
full
details
