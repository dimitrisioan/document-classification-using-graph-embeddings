IM
AFRAID
THIS
DOESNT
WORK
EITHER
WE
CAN
PICK
UP
LAPTOP
SCREENS
WITHOUT
ANY
PROBLEM
MOST
OF
THE
SOCALLED
LOW
RADIATION
MONITORS
ARE
ALSO
USELESS
THE
DESCRIPTION
TURNS
OUT
TO
A
MARKETING
ASSERTION
RATHER
THAN
AN
ENGINEERING
ONE
WE
THOUGHT
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
MARKET
FOR
A
MONITOR
WHICH
WAS
NOT
AS
HUGELY
EXPENSIVE
AS
THE
MILITARY
TEMPEST
KIT
BUT
WHICH
WAS
WELL
ENOUGH
SHIELDED
TO
STOP
EAVESDROPPING
USING
AVAILABLE
RECEIVERS
WE
BUILT
A
PROTOTYPE
IT
WORKS
AND
ITS
STILL
SITTING
ON
MY
LAB
BENCH
COMMERCIAL
INTEREST
WAS
EXACTLY
ZERO
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
OPEN
STANDARDS
A
MONITOR
WHICH
REALLY
IS
LOW
RADIATION
AND
COSTS
DOLLARS
MORE
CANT
COMPETE
AGAINST
A
MONITOR
WHICH
JUST
CLAIMS
TO
BE
LOW
RADIATION
AND
WHOSE
ONLY
EXTRA
COST
OF
PRODUCTION
IS
THE
PRETTY
BLUE
STICKER
ON
THE
BOX
ROSS
I
HEARD
SOMEWHERE
CANT
NAME
THE
SOURCE
THAT
TEMPEST
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
PICKUP
JUST
CRTS
BUT
IT
CAN
PICK
UP
EMISSIONS
FROM
ALMOST
ANY
CHIP
IF
THAT
IS
TRUE
THE
KIND
MONITOR
WOULD
NOT
MAKE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
BECUASE
EVERYTHING
ON
THE
SCREEN
CAN
BE
PICKEDUP
FROM
THE
VIDEO
CONTROLLER
CAN
ANYBODY
VERIFY
OR
REFUTE
THIS
JUST
THOUGHT
OF
SOMETHING
YES
LAPTOPS
CAN
STILL
BE
READ
BUT
ITS
NOT
QUITE
AS
EASY
AS
A
NORMAL
PC
WITH
A
CRT
MY
THOUGHT
AIRLINE
PILOTS
LATELY
HAVE
BEEN
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
HOW
LAPTOPS
BEING
USED
IN
FLIGHT
MESS
WITH
THE
PLANES
INSTRUMENTS
IF
THIS
CAN
BE
HYPED
UP
MANUFACTURERS
MAY
START
BUILDING
LAPTOPS
WITH
EVEN
LOWER
EMMISIONS
IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
STILL
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
PICK
UP
WITH
SURVEILLANCE
EQUIPMENT
BUT
AT
THIS
POINT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
LOT
CHEAPER
TO
MASK
THE
REMAINING
SIGNALS
WITH
TEMPEST
TECHNIQUES
