this
company
routinely
sent
most
of
the
manufacturing
data
to
the
field
offices
the
japanese
had
simply
intercepted
it
so
my
friend
the
computer
systems
admin
came
up
with
a
solution
he
started
sending
the
data
out
doubleblockencrypted
with
des
two
days
after
this
new
distribution
plan
was
implemented
the
president
of
the
company
got
a
visit
from
a
pair
of
government
agents
they
told
him
to
knock
it
off
the
president
gave
in
since
his
company
did
a
considerable
business
with
the
federal
government
now
if
the
government
wasnt
monitoring
the
communications
how
would
they
even
know
that
the
encryption
system
was
installed
how
can
you
be
sure
the
two
visitors
were
really
government
agents
