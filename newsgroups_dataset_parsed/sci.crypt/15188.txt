THERE
HAS
BEEN
LITTLE

COMMUNITY
TO
RESOLVE
THE
TENSION
BETWEEN
ECONOMIC
VITALITY
AND
THE
REAL
CHALLENGES
OF
PROTECTING
AMERICANS
RATHER
THAN
USE

TO
ACCOMMODATE
THE
SOMETIMES
COMPETING

IT
CAN
BE

THE

APPROPRIATE
CABINET
OFFICIALS
Q
WHO
WAS
CONSULTED
THE
CONGRESS
INDUSTRY
A
WE
HAVE
ONGOING

WITH

ON

ISSUES
AND
EXPECT
THOSE

TO
INTENSIFY
AS
WE
CARRY
OUT
OUR
REVIEW
OF

WE
HAVE
BRIEFED
MEMBERS
OF

LEADERS
ON
THE
DECISIONS
RELATED
TO
THIS
INITIATIVE
Q
WILL
THE

PROVIDE
THE
HARDWARE
TO
MANUFACTURERS
A
THE

DESIGNED

Q
HOW
DO
I
BUY
ONE
OF
THESE

WE
EXPECT
SEVERAL
MANUFACTURERS
TO
CONSIDER
INCORPORATING
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
INTO
THEIR

Q
IF
THE
ADMINISTRATION
WERE
UNABLE
TO
FIND
A
TECHNOLOGICAL
SOLUTION
LIKE
THE
ONE
PROPOSED
WOULD
THE
ADMINISTRATION
BE
WILLING
TO
USE
LEGAL
REMEDIES
TO
RESTRICT
ACCESS
TO
MORE
POWERFUL
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
A
THIS
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
POLICY
QUESTION
WHICH
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED
DURING
THE
BROAD
POLICY
REVIEW
THE
KEY
ESCROW
MECHANISM
WILL
PROVIDE
AMERICANS
WITH
AN
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THAT
IS
MORE
SECURE
MORE
CONVENIENT
AND
LESS
EXPENSIVE
THAN
OTHERS
READILY
AVAILABLE
TODAY
BUT
IT
IS
JUST
ONE
PIECE
OF
WHAT
MUST
BE
THE
COMPREHENSIVE
APPROACH
TO
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
WHICH
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
DEVELOPING
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
NOT
SAYING
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
THREATENS
THE
PUBLIC
SAFETY
AND
EFFECTIVE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WE
WILL
PROHIBIT
IT
OUTRIGHT
AS
SOME
COUNTRIES
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
DONE
NOR
IS
THE
US
SAYING
THAT
EVERY
AMERICAN
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
IS
ENTITLED
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THERE
IS
A
FALSE
TENSION
CREATED
IN
THE
ASSESSMENT
THAT
THIS
ISSUE
IS
AN
EITHEROR
PROPOSITION
RATHER
BOTH
CONCERNS
CAN
BE
AND
IN

ARE
HARMONIOUSLY
BALANCED
THROUGH
A
REASONED
BALANCED
APPROACH
SUCH
AS
IS
PROPOSED
WITH
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
SIMILAR
ENCRYPTION
TECHNIQUES
Q
WHAT
DOES
THIS
DECISION
INDICATE
ABOUT
HOW
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATIONS
POLICY
TOWARD
ENCRYPTION
WILL
DIFFER
FROM
THAT
OF
THE
BUSH
ADMINISTRATION
A
IT
INDICATES
THAT
WE
UNDERSTAND
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
ENCRYPTION
TECHNOLOGY
IN
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AND
COMPUTING
AND
ARE
COMMITTED
TO
WORKING
WITH

THE

IS
TRUE
FOR

ONE
OF
THE
ATTRACTIONS
OF
THIS

IS
THE

IT
CAN
