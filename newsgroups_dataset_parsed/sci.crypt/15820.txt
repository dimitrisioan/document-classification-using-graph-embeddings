ARTHUR
MELNICK
WRITES
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
EXPORT
APPROVAL
FOR
SECOMNEA
IT
WAS
NECESSARY
TO
GO
THROUGH
NSA
AND
TO
REVEAL
TO
THEM
THE
DETAILS
OF
THE
PROGRAM
AND
ALGORITHM
THIS
WAS
DONE
ONLY
AFTER
WE
HAD
A
FINISHED
PRODUCT
TO
SUBMIT
WITH
THE
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
APPROVED
FOR
EXPORT
WE
SET
PLEASE
DONT
BE
INSULTED
BUT
BASED
ON
THIS
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
YOUR
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
IS
VERY
LIKELY
NOT
WORTH
THE
PAPER
ITS
PRINTED
ON
IF
THE
NSA
GAVE
EXPORT
APPROVAL
THAT
MEANS
THEY
FELT
CONFIDENT
THAT
THEY
COULD
CRACK
IT
THATS
THEIR
JOB
MANDATED
BY
LAW
AND
IM
SURE
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
WHAT
THEY
DO
IF
THEY
GAVE
EXPORT
APPROVAL
TO
AN
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
WHICH
THEY
WERENT
CONFIDENT
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
CRACK
THEY
WOULD
BE
DERELICT
IN
THEIR
SWORN
DUTY
TO
MONITOR
FOREIGN
COMMUNICATIONS
FOR
US
NATIONAL
SECURITY
RELATED
MATERIAL
JUST
BECAUSE
MANY
MOST
OF
US
THINK
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
THE
SPOOKS
ARE
PUGNACIOUS
SLIMEBALLS
IS
NO
REASON
TO
LOSE
SIGHT
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
DO
THEIR
JOBS
TO
THE
BEST
OF
THEIR
ABILITY
AND
FURTHER
THAT
SAID
ABILITY
IS
RATHER
HIGH
I
HOPE
THAT
ONE
DAY
WE
CAN
MAKE
THEM
ALL
OBSOLETE
BUT
UNTIL
THEN
WE
HAVE
TO
COPE
WITH
THEIR
EXISTENCE
EXPORT
APPROVALS
ARE
ONE
THING
THEY
DO
THAT
WE
CAN
LEARN
A
LOT
FROM
FOR
EXAMPLE
