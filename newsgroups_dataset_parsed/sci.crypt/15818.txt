pgp
ideas
for
ibm
systems
ive
been
thinking
about
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
make
pgp
available
in
some
form
on
ebcdic
machines
the
message
authentication
would
be
ugly
but
i
think
at
least
the
idea
encryption
could
work
if
pgp
had
a
switch
to
tell
it
to
use
idea
in
ofbmode
or
ecbmode
in
ofbmode
errors
in
translating
ebcdicasciiebcdic
would
only
affect
their
byte
not
the
bytes
that
would
be
affected
under
cbc
is
pgp
set
up
to
use
different
idea
modes
i
dont
recall
notincing
it
in
the
executable
but
i
havent
gone
through
it
as
carefully
as
i
probably
should
