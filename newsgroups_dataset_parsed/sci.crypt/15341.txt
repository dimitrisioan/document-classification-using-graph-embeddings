RE
THE
SOURCE
OF
THAT
ANNOUNCEMENT
IN
ARTICLE
TCMAYNETCOMCOM
TIMOTHY
C
MAY
WRITES
I
KNOW
THAT
AT
LEAST
ONE
PERSON
ON
THAT
LIST
SAYS
THE
FIRST
HE
HEARD
OF
CLIPPER
WAS
IN
THE
FRIDAY
MORNING
NEWSPAPER
AND
ANOTHER
HAS
ALREADY
FIRED
OFF
A
LETTER
OF
PROTEST
TO
NIST
MY
POINT
I
SUSPECT
THIS
LIST
INTERESTING
AS
IT
IS
FOR
VARIOUS
REASONS
DOES
NOT
REPRESENT
THE
CABAL
THAT
PUT
THIS
PROPOSAL
TOGETHER
SOME
OF
THEM
YES
OTHERS
NO
I
RECEIVED
MAIL
FROM
MITCH
KAPOR
SAYING
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
ASK
TO
BE
ON
THE
LIST
AND
DOES
NOT
KNOW
WHY
HE
WAS
ADDED
IM
SURE
THE
SAME
APPLIES
TO
OTHERS
ON
THE
LIST
SO
I
GUESS
MY
INITIAL
THEORY
WAS
RIGHT
THAT
THE
CLIPPER
LIST
WAS
JUST
SOMEONES
IDEA
OF
A
BAD
JOKE
I
GUESS
I
SHOULD
BE
HAPPY
IT
WASNT
A
CONSPIRACY
