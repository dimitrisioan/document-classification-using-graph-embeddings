this
appears
to
be
generic
calling
upon
the
name
of
the
antichrist
just
for
the
hell
of
it
lets
destroy
this
remark
let
us
imagine
that
the
executive
branch
actually
could
extract
keys
from
the
escrow
houses
without
anyone
knowing
or
telling
now
what
dick
has
bits
of
data
what
the
hells
he
gonna
do
with
it
trot
around
to
the
telco
and
say
wed
like
an
unauthorised
decrypting
tap
uh
huh
break
in
to
watergate
and
install
his
own
tap
so
his
people
still
do
have
to
break
in
neat
huh
record
some
noise
then
get
the
executive
branch
phone
decryption
box
huh
theyve
got
one
goodness
wait
til
the
washington
post
gets
hold
of
this
and
decrypt
the
noise
more
likely
stare
at
the
key
and
say
oh
hell
its
not
worth
all
this
bloody
hassle
no
he
gives
the
keys
to
the
fbi
who
may
then
give
them
to
the
local
police
on
request
who
then
simply
put
some
alagator
clips
on
your
phone
junction
box
and
conduct
an
illegal
tap
they
then
decrypt
when
they
recover
the
tape
its
just
doing
what
the
government
does
best
breaking
the
law
bill
