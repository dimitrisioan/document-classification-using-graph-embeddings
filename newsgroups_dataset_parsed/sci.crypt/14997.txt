RE
LOOKING
FOR
ONEWAY
TRAPDOOR
PASSWORD
ENCRYPTION
ETC
ALGORITHMS
MICHAEL
LEVIN
WROTE
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
REFERENCES
TO
ALGORITHMS
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
PASSWORD
ENCRYPTION
IE
SOMEONE
HAS
A
CLEARTEXT
WORD
RUNS
IT
THROUGH
THE
ALGORITHM
AND
IT
BECOMES
SOME
OTHER
SEQUENCE
OF
SYMBOLS
I
WANT
THIS
ALGORITHM
TO
HAVE
THE
PROPERTY
THAT
IT
IS
A
NEXT
TO
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
REVERSE
AND
B
WOULD
TAKE
TOO
LONG
TO
TRY
ALL
POSSIBLE
WORDS
TO
SEE
WHICH
ONE
WORKS
EVEN
BY
USE
OF
A
HIGHSPEED
COMPUTER
PLEASE
SEND
REFERENCES
OR
IDEAS
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
ONEWAY
ENCRYPTION
I
PUT
INTO
MULTICS
ABOUT
AS
SUGGESTED
BY
JOE
WEIZENBAUM
WAS
INVERTIBLE
AN
AIR
FORCE
TIGER
TEAM
DEMONSTRATED
THIS
TO
ME
IN
MAY
I
THEN
ASKED
AN
EXPERT
WHO
REQUESTED
ANONYMITY
WHAT
I
SHOULD
USE
INSTEAD
THE
EXPERTS
SUGGESTION
WAS
TO
TREAT
THE
PASSWORD
AS
BOTH
KEY
AND
DATA
FOR
THE
LUCIFER
ENCRYPTION
ALGORITHM
WHICH
IS
SIMILAR
OR
IDENTICAL
TO
DES
THIS
METHOD
OR
SOMETHING
STRONGER
SHOULD
TAKE
CARE
OF
A
ISSUE
B
IS
DISCUSSED
IN
COMPSECURITYMISC
LONGER
PASSWORDS
AND
QUALITY
CONTROL
ON
WHAT
USERS
CAN
CHOOSE
AS
PASSWORDS
ARE
THE
COMMON
TACTICS
