THEY
HAVE
A
MUCH
BETTER
REASON
TO
CLASSIFY
THE
ALGORITHM
THAN
TO
PROTECT
ITS
SECURITY
THEY
WANT
TO
PROTECT
ITS
MARKET
SHARE
THATS
ONE
WAY
TO
PUT
IT
KEEPING
THE
ALGORITHM
CLASSIFIED
MEANS
THAT
DISCLOSURE
OF
IT
FALLS
UNDER
THE
RUBRIC
OF
NATIONAL
SECURITY
NOTHING
LIKE
FEDERAL
MARSHALLS
TO
GUARD
A
MONOPOLY
THE
RESULT
IS
TAPPABLE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
WITHOUT
LAWS
FORBIDDING
OTHER
KINDS
FOR
OF
THE
POPULACE
AGREED
ALTHOUGH
THIS
IS
STILL
SOMEWHAT
BETTER
THAN
THE
STATUS
QUO
TO
GET
UNTAPPABLE

YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BUILD
A
SPECIAL

RUNS
ON

EVERYBODY
YOU

WOULD
HAVE
TO
HAVE
