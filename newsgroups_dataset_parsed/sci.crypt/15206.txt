TEXT
OF
WHITE
HOUSE
ANNOUNCEMENT
AND
QAS
ON
CLIPPER
CHIP
ENCRYPTION
IN
ARTICLE
HALCCOCALTECHEDU
HAL
FINNEY
WRITES
THE
KEY
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
NONCLIPPER
ENCRYPTION
WILL
BE
MADE
ILLEGAL
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
NOT
SAYING
SINCE
ENCRYPTION
THREATENS
THE
PUBLIC
SAFETY
AND
EFFECTIVE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WE
WILL
PROHIBIT
IT
OUTRIGHT
AS
SOME
COUNTRIES
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
DONE
NOR
IS
THE
US
SAYING
THAT
EVERY
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
COUNTRIES
ARE
THESE
AMERICAN
AS
A
MATTER
OF
RIGHT
IS
ENTITLED
TO
AN
UNBREAKABLE
COMMERCIAL
ENCRYPTION
PRODUCT
THERE
IS
A
FALSE
TENSION
CREATED
IN
THE
ASSESSMENT
THAT
THIS
ISSUE
IS
AN
EITHEROR
PROPOSITION
RATHER
BOTH
CONCERNS
CAN
BE
AND
IN
FACT
ARE
HARMONIOUSLY
BALANCED
THROUGH
A
REASONED
BALANCED
APPROACH
SUCH
AS
IS
PROPOSED
WITH
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
AND
SIMILAR
ENCRYPTION
TECHNIQUES
THE
CLEAR
MIDDLE
GROUND
IMPLIED
BY
THESE
STATEMENTS
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
AMERICANS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
CLIPPER
ENCRYPTION
BUT
NOT
TO
UNBREAKABLE
ENCRYPTION
THIS
IMPLIES
THAT
ULTIMATELY
NONCLIPPER
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
MUST
BECOME
ILLEGAL
WITH
THE
FOLLOWING
LOGICAL
CONSEQUENCES
A
USING
ANY
CODE
DESIGNED
TO
OBSCURE
INFORMATIO
WHICH
IS
NOT
EASILY
BREAKABLE
WILL
BE
ILLEGAL
INCLUDING
I
USING
CODE

SUCH
AS
PROJECT
II
SPEAKING
A
LANGUAGE
OTHER
THAN
ENGLISH
III
EVER
REFERING
IMPLICITLY
TO
EVENTS
NOT
KNOWN
TO
EVERYONE
EG
HI
JOHN
HOW
WAS
LAST
NIGHT
FOR
ALL
THE

KNOWS
THIS
MAY
BE
A

LAST

WE
BLOW
UP
THE
PENTAGON

MENTIONING
ANYTHING
THAT
COULD
NOT
BE
PERFECTLY
UNDERSTOOD
BY
AN
AVERAGE
PERSON
WITH
NO
EDUCATION
V
WORDS
WITH
MORE
THAN
ONE
SYLLABLE
VI
SPEAKING
WITH
A
HEAVY
ACCENT
THAT
COULD
BEMISUNDERSTOOD
BY
PEOPLE
NOT
USED
TO

WITH
AN
INNER
MEANINGSUCH
AS
ANIMAL
FARM
AS
AN
ASIDE
ISNT
THE
LANGUAGE
HERE
JARRING
ALL
THIS
TALK
ABOUT
HARMONIOUS
BALANCE
WHEN
THEYRE
TALKING
ABOUT
TAKING
AWAY
PEOPLES
RIGHT
TO
COMMUNICATIONS
PRIVACY
YES
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THE
WORST
NIGHTMARES
RAISED
BY
DOROTHY
DENNINGS
PROPOSALS
ARE
COMING
TRUE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
CONTINUES
ON
THIS
COURSE
I
IMAGINE
THAT
WE
WILL
SEE
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
MADE
ILLEGAL
ENCRYPTION
PROGRAMS
FOR
DISK
FILES
AND
EMAIL
AS
WELL
AS
SOFTWARE
TO
ALLOW
FOR
ENCRYPTED
VOICE
COMMUNICATIONS
WILL
BE
DISTRIBUTED
ONLY
THROUGH
THE
UNDERGROUND
PEOPLE
WILL
HAVE
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
HIDE
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
ARE
PROTECTING
THEIR
PRIVACY
I
HAVE
A
WONDERFUL
ENCRYPTER
YOU
CAN
BORROW
THAT
CONVERTS
A
MESSAGE
EG
MEET
ME
AT

THE
WHITE
HOUSE
BRING
SOME
DYNAMITE
TO
AN
APPARENTLY
RELATIVELY
INNOCULOUS
MESSAGE
THIS
MESSAGE
HERE
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
OUTPUT
FOR
THE
ABOVE
MESSAGE
ITS
SHOCKING
AND
FRIGHTENING
TO
SEE
THAT
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
HAPPENING
HERE
IT
IS
SHOCKIONG
THAT
IT
COULD
HAPPEN
ANYWHERE
IT
IS
SHOCKING
THAT
IT
COULD
HAPPEN
IN
A

I
CANT
WORK
OUT
WHY
THE

THEY
ARE
RATHER
