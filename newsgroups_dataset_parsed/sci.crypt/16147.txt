THOMAS
GRANT
EDWARDS
WRITES
IF
THESE
PERSONAL
ATTACKS
ARE
WHAT
STOPPED
PROF
DENNING
FROM
REPLYING
ON
ISSUES
OF
SUBSTANCE
THEY
HAVE
CAUSE
REAL
HARM
TO
THE
SERIOUS
DEBATE
HERE
THEY
ARE
AND
THEY
HAVE
IF
PROF
DENNING
IS
AFRAID
OF
POSTING
HERE
DUE
TO
PERSONAL
ATTACKS
PERHAPS
SHE
SHOULD
USE
AN
ANONYMOUS
POSTING
SERVICE
THAT
IS
WHY
THEY
ARE
THERE
TO
ALLOW
HEATED
DEBATE
TO
OCCUR
WITHOUT
THE
PERSONAL
ATTACKS
ER
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
MAKE
PERSONAL
ATTACKS
ON
PROF
DENNING
WHETHER
SHE
POSTS
HERE
OR
NOT
THAT
MUCH
SHOULD
BE
OBVIOUS
FROM
LOOKING
AT
THE
TRAFFIC
OVER
THE
LAST
FEW
WEEKS
THEREFORE
I
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
PERSONAL
ATTACKS
IS
IRRELEVANT
TO
ANY
DECISION
CONCERNING
WHETHER
TO
POST
I
SUSPECT
THAT
PROF
DENNING
IS
ACTUALLY
USING
THE
ATTACKS
AS
AN
EXCUSE
FOR
NOT
POSTING
AND
THAT
THE
REAL
REASON
FOR
THE
SILENCE
IS
THAT
CLIPPER
IS
NOT
THE
SORT
OF
PROPOSAL
ANY
SELFRESPECTING
CRYPTOGRAPHER
CAN
SUPPORT
VIA
REASONED
ARGUMENT
MATHEW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
HAVE
CONSTRUCTIVE
DISCUSSIONS
HERE
AND
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
BY
YOUR
PEERS
YOU
MAY
WISH
TO
CONSIDER
SHAPING
UP
ADVICE

WAS
OFFERED
