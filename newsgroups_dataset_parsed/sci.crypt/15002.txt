WRITES
I
GUESS
WE
WILL
HAVE
TO
WAIT
FOR
THE
TIME
IN
THE
FAR
FUTURE
WHEN
EVERYONE
USES
SUCH
GOOD
CRYPTO
THAT
THE
NSA
HAS
NO
JOB
THEN
THE
AGENCY
WILL
BE
DISBANDED
AND
ITS
FILES
OPENED

THE
APPROPRATE
HISTORICAL
DELAY

OVERLOOKED

FUNDAMENTAL
TRUTH

MONOTONIC
INCREASING
FUNCTIONS
GIVEN
THAT
TRUTH
YOU
NEED
TO
LOOK
FOR
WHAT
THE
AGENCY
CAN
DO
TO
OCCUPY

THAT
EVEN
THE
INTERNAL
STATE
OF
A

WOULD
BE
AVAILABLE
FOR
ACCESS
BY
WIRETAPPING

DISCLAIMER
ALL
OPINIONS
EXPRESSED
