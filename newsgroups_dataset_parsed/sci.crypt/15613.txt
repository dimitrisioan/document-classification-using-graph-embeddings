WHAT
THE

NAYSAYERS
SOUND

TO
ME

ANDREW
MOLITOR
WRITES
A
LOT
OF
THIS
ARTICLE
HAS
BEEN
DELETED
FOR
SPACE
LOOK
THIS
IS
CLEARLY
THE
FIRST
STEP
TOWARD
OUTLAWING
OUR
OWN
SCREW
THREAD
SPECIFICATIONS
IF
THIS
MADNESS
ISNT
FOUGHT
TOOTH
AND
NAIL
EVERY
STEP
OF
THE
WAY
ITLL
BE
A
CRIME
TO
USE
SCREW
THREADS
OTHER
THAN
THOSE
OUR
FEARLESS
LEADERS
SO
GRACIOUSLY
DEFINE
FOR
US
THE
CLIPPER
STANDARD
IS
THE
FIRST
STEP
TOWARD
OUTLAWING
OTHER
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
STANDARDS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
DIDNT
INTEND
TO
OUTLAW
OTHER
FORMS
OF
ENCRYPTION
THAN
CLIPPER
IS
JUST
A
BIG
WASTE
OF
TIME
AND
MONEY
WHY
YOU
ASK
BECAUSE
ANYONE
WHO
IS
TRANSFERRING
DATA
THAT
ANY
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
COULD
USE
AGAINST
HIMHER
WOULD
BE
A
TOTAL
FOOL
TO
USE
THE
CLIPPER
SYSTEMSO
WHY
ADD
THE
BACKDOORKEY
IF
ALL
LAWBREAKERS
WILL
USE
ALTERNATE
ENCRYPTION
METHODS
BECAUSE
THEY
ASSUME
THEY
CAN
JUST
DO
AWAY
WITH
EVERYTHING
ELSE
I
FOR
ONE
AM
PLANNING
ON
BOYCOTTING
ANY
EQUIPMENT
THAT
CONTAINS
CLIPPER
TECHNOLOGY
