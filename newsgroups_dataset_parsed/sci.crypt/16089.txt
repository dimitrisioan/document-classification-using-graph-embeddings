re
i
have
seen
the
lobby
and
it

you
should
realize
that
form
letters
are
the
worst
way
to
influence
your
congresscritters
exact
copies
are
routinely
placed
on
the
lowest
rung
of
the
opinion
ladder
if
you
want
to
write
and
i
think
you
should
take
the
time
to
really
write
a
letter
things
to
emphasize
excellent
and
helpful
list
deleted
be
concise
dont
ramble
rants
are
definitely
out
of
place
cite
references
if
necessary
but
only
use
accepted
references
like
academic
journals
my
neighbor
jim
is
not
a
real
refer
ence
wess
list
is
of
dos
and
donts
for
writing
your
congressional
representatives
is
a
fine
one
but
id
like
to
encourage
people
to
pay
extra
attention
to
the
point
above
as
cliched
as
the
saying
may
be
its
nevertheless
true
that
you
can
catch
more
flies
with
honey
than
with
vinegar
while
the
writing
styles
prevalent
on
the
net
possess
a
certain
charm
please
remember
that
the
person
reading
your
letter
is
likely
to
be
uninfluenced
or
negatively
influenced
if
you
express
your
concerns
in
a
way
that
makes
you
sound
like
a
flake
or
a
paranoid
crackpot
wild
and
unsupported
accusations
about
the
menace
from
the
nsa
will
not
carry
much
weight
nor
are
overblown
conclusions
about
the
inevitable
consequences
of
the
proposal
likely
to
convince
especially
not
ones
that
attempt
strained
analogies
to
the
rise
of
the
nazi
party
please
save
the
niemoller
quote
for
another
letter
if
you
want
your
opinions
to
be
taken
seriously
it
is
very
important
that
you
state
those
opinions
in
a
manner
that
is
understandable
and
seems
reasonable
to
a
layman
dont
overburden
your
reader
with
technical
details
or
expect
them
to
know
the
history
of
various
encryption
technologies
before
you
mail
it
hand
your
letter
to
a
nontechnical
friend
and
ask
them
to
sanitycheck
it
above
all
realize
that
legislators
are
often
motivated
as
much
by
selfinterest
as
by
anything
else
try
to
point
out
risks
in
terms
that
will
be
meaningful
and
motivating
to
them
such
as
the
loss
of
individual
privacy
rights
or
the
damage
restrictive
export
regulations
do
to
american
businesses
ability
to
compete
in
the
global
marketplace
pull
the
strings
that
you
think
will
work
with
your
legislator
if
your
legislator
is
unlikely
to
be
swayed
by
civilrights
concerns
then
point
out
how
a
governmentgranted
monopoly
for
mycotronx
damages
the
competitiveness
of
businesses
in
your
district
that
manufacture
or
market
phone
or
crypto
technology
