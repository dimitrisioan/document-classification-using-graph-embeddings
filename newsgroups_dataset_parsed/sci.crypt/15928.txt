re
jerry
berman
on
pseudonymous
privacy
nobodyalumniccocaltechedu
correctly
states
jerry
bermans
view
on
privacy
but
he
mistakenly
assumes
that
this
represents
bermans
view
as
eff
executive
director
as
one
of
the
people
who
convinced
jerry
that
legal
protections
for
privacy
are
insufficient
and
that
technical
measures
especially
public
key
cryptography
are
also
vitally
necessary
i
can
tell
you
that
jerry
and
eff
are
fully
committed
to
this
position
the
previous
poster
is
apparently
unaware
of
a
long
series
of
eff
positions
in
support
of
this
view
i
suggest
those
interested
read
effs
position
on
clipper
or
our
other
work
in
digital
privacy
check

for
more
details
one
of
the
great
things
about
human
beings
is
that
they
are
capable
of
change
and
evolution
in
their
thinking
the
idea
that
crypto
is
critical
to
privacy
is
one
which
is
no
longer
limited
to
certain
net
afficianados
but
is
spreading
to
parts
of
the
public
policy
community
