CORRECTLY

JERRY
BERMANS
VIEW

BUT
HE
MISTAKENLY
ASSUMES
THAT
THIS
REPRESENTS
BERMANS
VIEW
AS

EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR
AS
ONE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CONVINCED
JERRY
THAT
LEGAL
PROTECTIONS
FOR
PRIVACY
ARE
INSUFFICIENT
AND
THAT
TECHNICAL
MEASURES
ESPECIALLY
PUBLIC
KEY
CRYPTOGRAPHY
ARE
ALSO
VITALLY
NECESSARY
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
JERRY
AND
EFF
ARE
FULLY
COMMITTED
TO
THIS
POSITION
THE

POSTER
IS
APPARENTLY
UNAWARE
OF
A
LONG

IN

OF
THIS

I
SUGGEST

EVOLUTION
IN
THEIR
THINKING
THE
IDEA
THAT
CRYPTO
IS
CRITICAL
TO
PRIVACY
IS
ONE
WHICH
IS
NO
LONGER
LIMITED
TO
CERTAIN
NET
AFFICIANADOS
BUT
IS
SPREADING
TO
PARTS
OF
THE
