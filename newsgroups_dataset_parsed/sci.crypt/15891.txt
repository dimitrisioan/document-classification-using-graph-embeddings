re
lets
build
software
cryptophones
for
over
the
internet
i
forwarded
an
old
posting
about
celp
speech
compression
in
case
youd
like
to
experiment
with
celp
you
can
obtain
a
software
implementation
of
the
bps
fed
std
celp
coder
for
free
the
us
dods
based
bps
code
excited
linear
prediction
voice
coder
version
celp
fortran
and
c
simulation
source
codes
are
now
available
for
worldwide
distribution
at
no
charge
on
dos
diskettes
but
configured
to
compile
on
sun
sparc
stations
from
ive
since
been
told
that
the
source
of
this
is
on
cygnuscom
in
pubcelpspeechtarz
im
not
in
a
position
to
any
sun
tcpip
gurus
out
there
who
think
they
can
marry
this
with
netfone
by
the
end
of
the
week
seriously
i
think
someone
with
real
net
access
and
two
sparcs
could
have
this
running
by
the
end
of
the
week
then
we
ask
the
pgp
guys
to
add
a
bytestream
crypto
filter
two
weeks
at
the
most
damn
i
wish
i
had
my
sparc
back
im
stuck
on
a
share
and
enjoy
g
ps
youll
have
to
use
archie
to
find
netfone
i
have
a
copy
but
no
note
of
where
its
from
author
in
the
docs
is
kelvinautodeskcom
and
he
appears
to
be
located
in
france
