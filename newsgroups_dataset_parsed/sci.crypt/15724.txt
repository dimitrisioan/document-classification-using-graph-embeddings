IT

WE

SIGH
MY
VERSION
OF

ASKED
ME
WHETHER
I
REALLY
WANT
TO
SEND
THIS
POSTING
YOU
MAY
AS
WELL
KNOW
THAT
ALL
THIS
STUFF
ABOUT
THE
SECRET
SOURCE
OF
THE
CLIPPER
ANNOUNCEMENT
IS
BECAUSE
OF
A
SILLY
MISTAKE
I
AM
THE
ADMINISTRATOR
OF
CSRCNCSLNISTGOV
ALIAS
FIRSTORG
ITS
A
SYSTEM
SET
UP
TO
HELP
OUT
THE
NEEDS
OF
FIRST
A
FORUM
OF
INCIDENT
RESPONSE
AND
SECURITY
TEAMS
WHICH
INCLUDES
A
NUMBER
OF
WORLDWIDE
INCIDENT
RESPONSE
TEAMS
SUCH
AS
CERTCC
AND
OTHER
PLACES
IN
EUROPE
AS
TO
THE
VRFY
AND
EXPN
COMMANDS
THEY
ARE
NORMALLY
DISABLED
SINCE
EARLY
ON
WE
DIDNT
WANT
CRACKERS
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
NAMES
OF
INCIDENT
RESPONSE
FOLKS
ON
OUR
MAILING
LISTS
WE
HAD
A
DISK
CRASH
SEVERAL
MONTHS
AGO
WHICH
REQUIRED
COMPLETELY
REBUILDING
THE
OS
FILES
SAME
OLD
STORY
OUR
BACKUPS
WERENT
ESPECIALLY
HELPFUL
AS
YOU
CAN
GUESS
I
DIDNT
REMEMBER
TO
REDISABLE
VRFY
AND
EXPN
UNTIL
I
SAW
PEOPLE
ON
THE
NET
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
WHO
WAS
BEHIND
CLIPPERCSRC
WHEN
I
SAW
PEOPLES
NAMES
POSTED
HERE
I
FELT
IT
WAS
TIME
TO
CLEAR
THINGS
UP
SO
EXPN
AND
VRFY
ON
CSRC
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
DISABLED
IN
THE
PAST
FOR
REASONS
HAVING
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
CLIPPER
I
POSTED
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
ANNOUNCEMENTS
AT
THE
REQUEST
OF
POLICY
FOLKS
HERE
BECAUSE
CSRC
ALSO
PROVIDES
USENET
SERVICE
I
POSTED
THEM
FROM
AN
ACCOUNT
CALLED
CLIPPER
I
ALSO
CREATED
AN
ALIAS
CALLED
CLIPPER
THAT
CONTAINS
THE
ADDRESSES
OF
MEMBERS
OF
THE
NIST
COMPUTER
SECURITY
PRIVACY
AND
ADVISORY
BOARD
SET
UP
UNDER
LAW
OF
THE
COMPUTER
SECURITY
ACT
OF
AND
ADDRESSES
OF
OTHER
INDIVIDUALS
NOT
AFFILIATED
WITH
NIST
BUT
INVOLVED
IN
CRYPTOGRAPHY
SECURITY
AND
PRIVACY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
WERE
INCLUDED
ON
THIS
LIST
BECAUSE
NIST
FELT
IT
IMPORTANT
TO
GET
THEM
THE
CLIPPER
INFORMATION
FIRSTHAND
THE
CLIPPER
ALIAS
IS
THERE
FOR
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THOSE
NAMED
ABOVE
IT
IS
NOT
A
SOURCE
FOR
INFORMATION
IT
WAS
SET
UP
SOLELY
TO
MONITOR
ANY
INITIAL
TRAFFIC
INDIVIDUALS
ON
THE
LIST
HAVE
REQUESTED
THAT
THEY
CONTINUE
TO
GET
TRAFFIC
THAT
IS
NOT
ALREADY
DUPLICATED
ON
USENET
WHILE
YOU
CAN
RIGHTFULLY
SAY
WE
WERE
A
BIT
DISORGANIZED
IN
HANDLING
THIS
I
WOULD
ASK
THAT
PEOPLE
STOP
SPECULATING
ABOUT
ANY
HIDDEN
AGENDAS
OR
MOTIVES
OF
THE
INDIVIDUALS
ON
THE
CLIPPER
ALIAS
IVE
ALREADY
APOLOGIZED
TO
THEM
FOR
WHATS
HAPPENED
DISABLING
EXPN
AND
VRFY
IS
AN
INCREASINGLY
COMMON
PRACTICE
ALBEIT
UNFRIENDLY
TO
SOME
AND
ANY
EFFECT
OF
DISABLING
IT
AGAIN
WAS
UNINTENTIONAL
