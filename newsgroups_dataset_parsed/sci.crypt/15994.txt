re
new
encryption
algorithm
well
actually
this
ones
easy
its
their
job
the
nsa
is
supposed
to
develop
cryptosystems
if
the
government
chooses
to
go
ahead
and
sell
those
cryptosystems
to
the
masses
so
be
it
ah
but
developing
cryptosystems
which
are
specificially
designed
to
protect
the
governments
domestic
spying
capabilities
takes
them
beyond
that
mandate
into
the
forbidden
field
of
domestic
wiretapping
the
nsas
charter
forbids
them
from
doing
any
purely
domestic
intelligence
work
i
would
think
that
even
providing
assistance
in
development
of
the
skipjack
algorithom
is
a
violation
of
that
charter
but
as
with
any
intrenched
government
agency
they
will
do
what
they
think
is
expedent
