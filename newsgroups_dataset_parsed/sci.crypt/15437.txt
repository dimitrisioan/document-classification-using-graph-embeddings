WRITES
BULLSHIT
THE
BUSH
ADMINISTRATION
AND
THE
CAREER
GESTAPO
WERE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THIS
HORROR
AND
THE
CAREERISTS
PRESENTED
IT
TO
THE
NEW
PRESIDENCY
AS
A
FAIT
ACCOMPLI
THAT
DOESNT
EXCUSE
CLINTON
AND
GORE
FROM
CRITICISM
FOR
BEING
SO
STUPID
AS
TO
GO
FOR
IT
BUT
LETS
LAY
THE
BODY
AT
THE
PROPER
DOOR
TO
START
WITH
THE
FINAL
STAGES
OF
DENIAL
I
CAN
HARDLY
IMAGINE
WHAT
THE
RESULT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
IF
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
HAD
ACTUALLY
SUPPORTED
THIS
PLAN
INSTEAD
OF
MERELY
ACQUIESCING
WITH
REPUGNANCE
AS
THEYVE
SO
OBVIOUSLY
DOING
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THE
CHIP
ORIGINATED
WITH
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
EITHER
BUT
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
EMBRACED
IT
AND
BROUGHT
IT
TO
FRUITION
BOTH
OF
THE
MAJOR
PARTIES
HAVE
WHAT
THEY
CONSIDER
EXCELLENT
REASONS
FOR
LIMITING
YOUR
FREEDOMS
AND
VIOLATING
YOUR
PRIVACY
AND
EVEN
SEEM
TO
FEEL
THAT
THEYRE
DOING
YOU
A
FAVOR
IF
THIS
IS
REALLY
SURPRISING
TO
ANYONE
IT
MEANS
THEYVE
BEEN
WILLFULLY
IGNORING
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
PREVIOUS
EVIDENCE
THERES
ONLY
ONE
POLITICAL
PARTY
NOT
CALLING
ANARCHISTS
A
PARTY
THAT
CONSIDERS
YOUR
FREEDOM
AND
PRIVACY
GOALS
WORTHY
IN
AND
OF
THEMSELVES
IF
YOURE
VOTING
FOR
THE
BIG
TWO
YOURE
SUPPORTING
A
REDUCTION
OF
THOSE
RIGHTS
GIVEN
THEIR
GOALS
AND
THEIR
HISTORIES
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
YOU
PERSONALLY
SUPPORT
THAT
REDUCTION
TO
PAINT
CLINTON
AND
GORE
AS
UNWITTING
TOOLS
IS
REALLY
STRETCHING
THINGS
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
TO
KILL
A
MAN
IT
COSTS
NOTHING
