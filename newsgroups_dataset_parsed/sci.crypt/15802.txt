a
conversation
between
a
suspect
and
a
lawyer
will
no
longer
be
private
from
big
brother
eavesdropping
now
almost
years
later
we
have
the
right
words
for
the
problem
here
phone
calls
are
virtual
visits
those
experienced
in
virtual
reality
would
know
from
that
title
that
phone
calls
need
to
have
all
the
properties
of
a
walk
in
the
park
with
your
friend
security
from
casual
overhearing
and
easy
verification
to
see
if
anyone
is
listening
secretively
as
designed
they
fail
at
that
trouble
is

were
invented
a

danger
or
the
concept
of
virtual
reality
back
