I
THINK
THAT
WHAT
THESE
POINTS
SHOW
CLEARLY
IS
THAT
AN
ANONYMOUS
POSTING
SERVICE
HAS
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
RESPONSIBILITY
BOTH
TOWARDS
ITS
CLIENTS
AND
TOWARDS
THE
NET
AS
A
WHOLE
SUCH
A
SERVICE
SHOULD
IMHO
HAVE
A
SET
OF
WELLDEFINED
RULES
AND
A
CONTRACT
THAT
ITS
CLIENTS
SHOULD
SIGN
UNDER
THE
TERMS
OF
WHICH
THEY
ARE
ASSURED
ANONYMITY
FROM
IS
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
SOME
ARE
USED
TO
PUNISHING
POSTERS
WHO
ARE
UPSETTING
IN
SOME
VAGUE
WAY
BY
COMPLAINING
TO
THE
USUALLY
ACQUIESCENT
SYSADMIN
OR
ORGANIZATIONS
THAT
THE
POSTER
BELONGS
TO
THAT
SURELY
IS
THE
MOST
GUTLESS
APPROACH
TO
SOLVING
PROBLEMS
BUT
MY
EXPERIENCE
ON
THE
NET
SHOWS
THAT
THE
SAME
USERS
WHO
VILIFY
ANONYMOUS
POSTINGS
ARE
THE
FIRST
TO
WRITE
OBSESSIVELY
DETAILED
GRIEVANCES
TO
THE

SUPERVISOR
WHEN
HIS
OR
HER
TRANQUILITY
IS
DISTURBED
BY
SOME
INTRUSIVE
OR
SUBVERSIVE
POST
OR
ANOTHER
ANONYMOUS
POSTINGS
PREVENT
JUST
THIS
KIND
OF
INTIMIDATION
FROM
GANDALFCYBERSPACEORG
ERIC
SCHILLING
THE
MAIN
POINT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
MAKE
HERE
IS
THAT
WHILE
WE
CAN
GO
THROUGH

REVISE
THE

SW
TO
REJECT

TO

OR
SOME
SUCH
THING
I
THINK
THE
ATTEMPT
WILL
PROVE
FUTILE
EACH
ATTEMPT
TO
MODIFY

CAN
RESULT
IN
A
CHANGED
APPROACH
BY

NOW
I
RALLY
FEEL
LIKE
I
HAVE
TO
SPEAK
UP
I
HAVE
REPEATEDLY
MADE
CLEAR
THAT
I
DO
BLOCK

IF
THEY
CONTINUE
THEIR

AFTER
HAVING
BEEN
WARNED
IN
MANY
CASES
THE

HAVE
TAKEN
HEED
OF
THE

AND
STOPPED
AND
IN
SOME
CASES
EVEN
APOLOGIZED
IN

AND
WHEN
THE
WARNING
HAS
NOT
HAD
THE
DESIRED
EFFECT
I
HAVE
BLOCKED
A
NUMBER
OF

I
HAVE
ALSO
BLOCKED
ACCESS
TO

WHERE
THE
READERSHIP
HAS
TAKEN
A
VOTE
TO
BAN
ANONYMOUS

ALTHOUGH
I
FEEL
CHANGING
THE

IS
THE
ONLY
PERMANENT
SOLUTION
FOR

THAT
WANT
TO
FORMALIZE

REDREDPOLLNEOUCOMEDU

DOES
THIS

THAT

ARE
VOLUNTEERING

A

OR
TO
MODERATE
EACH
OF
THE

THAT

DONT

THIS
ILLUSTRATES
THE
TROUBLE
THAT
YOUR

IS
CAUSING
PLEASE
LISTEN
TO
THE
CONSENSUS
OF
THE

ADMINISTRATORS
IN
THIS

ANY
NEWSGROUP
SHOULD
BE
CONSULTED
BEFORE
LETTING
YOUR

POST

TO
THAT

FROM

THERE
IS
NO
POMPOUS
CONSENSUS
OF

HERE
MAYBE
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
INVENT

THERE
IS
A
SIZEABLE

POSSIBLE
AND
TO
A
MINOR
EXTENT
ABOUT
THE
ACTUAL

OF

AS
IT
IS
CONFIGURED
NOW
THESE
CONCERNS
ARE
RESPECTABLE
JOHAN
IS

WITH

THERE
ARE
SOME
FEW
WHO
RAGE
WITH
FOAM
BEFORE
THEIR

AND
CONDEMN
THE

ALTOGETHER
AND
A
NUMBER
WHO
DEFEND
IT
POINTING

EVEN

FROM

JOHAN

I
HAVE
ANSWERED

A

WITHDRAWN

WHERE
THE

HAVE
TAKEN
A

ON
THE

I
HAVE
NOT

ANY

PARTLY
BECAUSE
THE

MEASURE
AGAINST
A

HAS
KEPT
ME
REALLY
BUSY
ANSWERING

THE

AND
PARTLY
BECAUSE
I
FEEL
IT
IS
NOT
FOR
ME
TO
JUSTIFY
THE

BUT
FOR
THE

THE
PROBLEM
WITH
NEWSADMINPOLICY
IS
THAT
THE

IS
RATHER
ELECTIVE
REPRESENTING
PEOPLE
WHITH
A
STRONG
INTEREST
IN

FROM

THIS

THOSE
THAT

THE

POLICY
CHANGES
SHOULD
BE
MADE
BY

BY

I
MUST
ADMIT
TO
SOME
ASTONISHMENT
AT
THIS
ARGUMENT
I
SEE
THE
VALUE
OF
ANONYMOUS

UNDER
SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES
YET
BELIEVE
STRONGLY
THAT
THESE
SHOULD
BE
IDENTIFIED
AS

SO
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO

FAIL

INDEED

THAT
YOU
WILL
CAUSE
MANY

INCONVENIENCE
AND
ANNOYANCE
BY

UNFORTUNATELY
ONE
OF

COMPLAINED
TO
THE

REASEARCH
NETWORK
THROUGH
WHOM
MY

IS
CONNECTED
NOT
ABOUT

IN

JUST
THE
CONCEPT
OF
ANONYMOUS
MAIL
HAVING
NO
REDEEMING
FEATURES
AND
CONSUMING
A
NARROW
BANDWIDTH
LINK
WITH
WHICH
I
CANT
ARGUE
AND
THAT
WAS
THAT
STOP
THE
SERVICE
OR
FACE
DISCONNECTION
I
CONSIDER
THE
DEMISE
OF
MY
SERVICE
TO
HAVE
BEEN
RATHER
UNFORTUNATE
AND
I
WISH
THE
FINNISH
REMAILER
LUCK
IT
IS
A
PITY
THAT
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
IF
ANY
SIMILAR
SERVICES
PROVIDED
WITH
IN
THE
US
I
GUESS
THATS
THE
BENEFIT
OF
HAVING
A
CONSTITUTION
THAT
GUARANTEES
ONE
FREEDOM
OF

AND
A
LEGAL
AND
POLITICAL
SYSTEM
THAT
CONSPIRES
TO
SUBVERT
IT
IN
THE

OF
THE

GOOD
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
WITH

RUN
BY

FROM

FUNNY
HOW
BEATING
THE

OF
THE

OVER
THE

WITH
A
STICK
IS
OK
IF
ITS
ANONPENETFI
AND
UNIVERSAL
ANON

BUT
SOMEHOW
PEOPLE
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
SAME
EQUATION
NOT
EVEN
ARGUING
TO
SHUT
IT
OFF
ENTIRELY
BUT
RATHER
JUST
TO
HAVE
SOME
CONTROL
APPLIED
TO
THE
ABUSES
THAT
MANIFEST
THEMSELVES
ARENT
ALLOWED
TO
DO
THAT
I
HAVE
WRITTEN

SEVERAL

IN

THE

CRASHED
MY

THE

WAS

THE

THAT
YOUR

AS
I
HAVE
TRIED

AS

OF

THE

I
SPEND

PER

WHY
IS
IT
THAT
EVERYBODY
ELSE
HAS
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
THE
IMPOLITENESS
AND
INSENSITIVITY
OF
THE
MISUSE
OF
ANONPENETFI
WHOSE
DEFINITIONS
OF
POLITE
AND
SENSE
APPLY
AND
WHY
WHY
IS
UNIVERSAL
ANON
ACCESS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
WITHIN
THE
REALM
OF
THIS
FUZZY
CONCEPT
OF
POLITENESS
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
I
THINK
JOHAN
HAS
LONG
SINCE
CROSSED
THE
LINE
INTO
BEING
A
RUDE
BASTARD
AND
I
TOLD
HIM
SO
IN
PRIVATE
MAIL
A
LITTLE
WHILE
AGO
AT
THIS
POINT
I
DEEPLY
REGRET
A
HAVING
CREATED
AN
ANONYMOUS
SYSTEM
SUPPORTING
NEWSGROUP
AND
B
HAVING
GIVEN
THE
CODE
TO
JOHAN
I
DIDNT
COPYRIGHT
IT
BUT
I
THOUGHT
THAT
SOME
CONCEPT
OF
POLITENESS
AND
GOOD
SENSE
MIGHT
FOLLOW
IT
TO
NEW
HOMES
INTERESTING
THAT
JOHANS
IDEAS
OF
POLITENESS
AND
GOOD
SENSE
SEEM
TO
HAVE
NEARLY
NO
INTERESECTION
WITH
MINE
I
COULD
EVEN
COPE
WITH
UNIVERSAL
ANON
ACCESS
IF
JOHAN
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
ENGAGE
IN
ABUSE
CONTROL
BUT
SOMEHOW
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
OUTSIDE
THE
RANGE
OF
REALITY
FROM
JULFPENETFI
JOHAN
HELSINGIUS
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
FOR
ME
TO
CONVEY
HOW
SAD
AND
UPSET
YOUR

MADE
ME
I
DO
TO
SOME
EXTENT
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
FEELINGS
BUT
IT
STILL
FEELS
REALLY
BAD
RUNNING
THE
SERVER
REQUIRES
GETTING
USED
TO
A
LOT
OF
FLAMES
BUT
MINDLESSLY
ABUSIVE
HATE
MAIL
IS
SO
MUCH
EASIER
TO
DEAL
WITH
THAN
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
AS
I
DO
RESPECT
AND
VALUE
YOUR
VIEWS
AND
OPINIONS
TO
A
HIGH
DEGREE
NO
IM
NOT
ASKING
FOR
SYMPATHY
I
JUST
WANTED
YOU
TO
KNOW
THAT
I
AM
REALLY
GIVING
YOUR
VIEWS
QUITE
A
LOT
OF
WEIGHT
WHEN
I
ASKED
FOR
THE
SOFTWARE
I
WAS
ACTUALLY
ONLY
GOING
TO
PROVIDE
THE
SERVICE
TO
SCANDINAVIAN
USERS
BUT
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
REQUESTED
THAT
I
KEEP
THE
SERVICE
OPEN
TO
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY
I
NOW
REALIZE
THAT
I
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
CONTACTED
YOU
AT
THAT
POINT
TO
ASK
HOW
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
ME
USING
YOUR
STUFF
IN
SUCH
A
CONTEXT
AGAIN
I
REALLY
WANT
TO
APOLOGISE
AND
I
WILL
REPLACE
THE
REMAINING
FEW
PIECES
OF
CODE
THET
STILL
STEM
FROM
YOUR
SYSTEM
UNFORTUNATELY
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
REMOVE
THE
IDEAS
AND
STRUCTURE
I
GOT
FROM
YOU
AGAIN
I
AM
REALLY
SORRY
THAT
THE
RESULTS
OF
YOUR
WORK
ENDED
UP
BEING
USED
IN
A
WAY
THAT
YOU
DONT
APPROVE
OF
AND
I
WILL
BE
GIVING
A
LOT
OF
HARD
THOUGHT
TO
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
SHUTTING
DOWN
THE
SERVER
ALLTOGETHER
FROM
KARLKLEINPASTECSCMUEDU
I
THINK
IM
FEELING
ESPECIALLY
RUDE
AND
IMPOLITE
IF
ITS
GOOD
FOR
JOHAN
ITS
GOOD
FOR
ME
AFTER
ALL
HE
DIDNT
ASK

WHETHER
UNIVERSAL
ANON
ACCESS
WAS
A
GOOD
IDEA
HE
JUST
DID
IT
YES
IM
A
SERIOUSLY
RUDE
PAIN
IN
THE
ASS
NOW
AND
I
THINK
ILL
ARM
THE
USENET
DEATH
PENALTY
SLIGHTLY
MODIFIED
NOT
FOR
STRATEGIC
WHOLESITE
ATTACK
BUT
TACTICAL
ASSAULT
JUST
DESTRUCTION
ONLY
OUTSIDE
ALT
TOO
LETS
SAY
TO
PARROT
THIS
LINEPEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
THINGS
LIKE
THE
UDP
THAT
IS
CANCELLING
OTHERS
POSTINGS
FOR
YEARS
NO
ONE
COULD
EVER
STOP
THEM
AND
ITS
ONLY
POLITENESS
AND
GOOD
SENSE
THAT
HAS
PREVENTED
THEM
UP
TO
NOW
IN
FACT
I
HAVE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
EXPRESSED
PRIVATELY
THE
DESIRE
AND
ABILITY
TO
ARM
THE
UDP
PS
NO
IN
FACT
THERE
ARE
NOT
NEWSADMINS
READY
TO
ARM
THE
UDP
IT
WOULD
BE
AMUSING
TO
KNOW
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
GULPED
HARD
WHEN
THEY
READ
THAT
THOUGH
I
DONT
SEE
IT
AS
ANY
DIFFERENT
FROM
JOHANS
CONFIGURATION
PPS
NOW
THAT
IVE
CALMED
SOME
FEARS
BY
THE
ABOVE
PS
THERE
ARE
NEWSADMINS
READY
TO
ARM
THE
UDP
THEYVE
ASKED
FOR
MY
CODE
I
HAVENT
SENT
IT
YET
ONLY
ONE
SITE
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
TO
BRING
ANONPENETFI
TO
A
SCREECHING
HALT
ANYONE
CAN
IMPLEMENT
THE
UDP
ON
THEIR
OWN
IF
THEY
CARE
TO
POLITENESS
AND
GOOD
SENSE
PREVENTS
THEM
FROM
DOING
SO
I
WONDER
HOW
LONG
BEFORE
ONE
FORM
OF
IMPOLITENESS
BRINGS
ON
ANOTHER
FORM
FROM
JULFPENETFI
JOHAN
HELSINGIUS
IT
WOULD
BE
TRIVIALLY
EASY
TO
BRING
ANONPENETFI
TO
A
SCREECHING
HALT
IN
FACT
IT
HAS
HAPPENED
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
ALREADY
BUT
AS
WE
ARE
TALKING
THREATS
HERE
LET
ME
MAKE
ONE
AS
WELL
A
VERY
SIMPLE
ONE
IF
SOMEBODY
USES
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
UDP
OR
MALICIOUSLY
BRINGS
DOWN
ANONPENETFI
BY
SOME
OTHER
MEANS
IT
WILL
STAY
DOWN
BUT
I
WILL
LET
THE
USERS
KNOW
WHY
AND
NAME
THE
PERSON
WHO
DID
IT
OK
AS
SOMEBODY
SAID
ON
THIS
THREAD
YOU
HAVE
TO
TAKE
PERSONAL
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
YOUR
ACTIONS
RIGHT
FROM
ATUL
V
SALGAONKAR
I
AM
VERY
GRATEFUL
AND
APPRECIATIVE
OF
THIS
SERVICE
COURTESEY
OF
PENETFI
SOME
IMPORTANT
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
MY
PERSONAL
LIFECAREERJOB
WERE
RESOLVED
DUE
TO
KIND
HELP
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
THRU
SIMILAR
SITUATIONS
IN
RETURN
I
HAVE
ALSO
REPLIED
TO
ANON
POSTINGS
WHERE
I
THOUGHT
I
COULD
MAKE
A
POSITIVE
CONTRIBUTION
IN
GENERAL
ANON
SERVICE
IS
A
GREAT
IN
MY
OPINION
ALTHOUGH
LIKE
ANY
TOOL
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
NOT
USE
IT
RESPONSIBLY
I
SUGGEST
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
KEPT
ALIVE
WASTING
BANDWIDTH
IS
LESS
IMPORTANT
THAN
SAVING
LIVES

THINK
FROM

FELT
I
