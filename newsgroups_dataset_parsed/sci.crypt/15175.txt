ALL
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
ISYEAH
RIGHT
IF
YOURE
WILLING
TO
PAY
THEM
MUCHO
BIG
BUCKS
ANDOR
USE
THE
ROUTINES
THEY
TELL
YOU
TO
DO
DOESNT
SOUND
VERY
REASONABLE
TO
ME
ALL
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
IS
THIS
IS
FULL
OF
SHIT
I
HAVE
NEGOTIATED
A
LICENSE
AND
THE
BUCKS
ARE
INCREDIBLY
REASONABLE
WITH
AN
UPFRONT
CHARGE
ON
A
SLIDING
SCALE
DEPENDING
ON
YOUR
CAPITALIZATION
IF
YOU
ARE
A
STARTUP
AND
CANT
AFFORD
IT
YOU
CANT
AFFORD
TO
START
UP
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
WHY
DO
PEOPLE
INSIST
ON
MAKING
UNEQUIVOCAL
STATEMENTS
ABOUT
THAT
WHICH
THEY
KNOW
NOTHING
BUT
I
DONT
GUESS
PKP
AND
RSA
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
BIG
BUCKS
MAYBE
THEY
HAVE
SOME
OTHER
AGENDA
SECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
ONLY
FOR
GOVERNMENT
AGENTS
PERHAPS
HAVE
YOU
CONSIDERED
TREATMENT
FOR
PARANOIA
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
THE
SINGLE
BIGGEST
THORN
IN
RSAS
SIDE
SOME
LIMITATION
LET
ME
GUESS
DONT
USE
THE
CODE
IN
ANY
WAY
PKP
OR
RSA
DOESNT
LIKESUCH
ASPROVIDING
SECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
FOR
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
THAT
WAS
EXACTLY
ITS
PURPOSE
IF
YOU
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
AT
ALL
PREVENTING
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
USING
IT
ONLY
SELLING
IT
I
HOPE
MY
CYNICISM
IS
MISPLACED
HERE
GO
AHEADIM
NOT
AFRAID
TO
BE
WRONG
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
BUT
I
HAVE
AN
UNEASY
FEELING
THAT
I
AM
RIGHT
IT
IS
AND
YOU
ARE
WRONG
YET
YOU
EMOTIONALLY
STATE
A
BUNCH
OF
CRAP
AS
FACT
WITH
A
TINY
DISCLAIMER
AT
THE
END
CHECK
YOUR
FACTS
FIRST
AND
GROW
UP
WHY
IS
THERE
SUCH
A
STRONG
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
INTEREST
IN
CRYPTOGRAPHY
AND
IMMATURITY
