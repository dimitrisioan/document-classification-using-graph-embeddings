RE
CLIPPER
CONSIDERED
HARMFUL
FROM
SHIRRIFFSPRITEBERKELEYEDU
KEN
SHIRRIFF
MESSAGEID
IT
SEEMS
LIKELY
TO
ME
THAT
THAT
A
LARGE
SUBSET
OF
ENCRYPTED
COMMUNICATIONS
WOULD
BE
ARCHIVED
TO
TAPE
SO
THEY
COULD
BE
READ
IF
SOMETIME
IN
THE
FUTURE
PROBABLE
CAUSE
ARISES
AND
A
WARRANT
IS
OBTAINED
I
THINK
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
DATA
LIKE
THIS
COULD
BE
USED
IN
COURT
CURRENTLY
LEAS
CAN
INSTALL
WIRETAPS
ON
LARGE
NUMBERS
OF
PHONES
RECORD
CALLS
WITHOUT
LISTENING
TO
THEM
AND
THEN
POSTFACTO
OBTAIN
WARRANTS
AND
LISTEN
TO
CALLS
AFTER
PROBABLE
CAUSE
IS
ESTABLISHED
BUT
THIS
STRATEGY
WOULDNT
GET
THE
STUFF
ADMITTED
IN
COURT
AT
LEAST
NOT
IN
THE
NEAR
TERM
IN
OTHER
WORDS
NEAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
THE
THING
THAT
MAKES
SUCH
EVIDENCE
INADMISSABLE
IS
THE
INTERCEPTION
WITHOUT
A
WARRANT
NOT
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
INTERPRET
WHAT
WAS
INTERCEPTED
WITHOUT
A
WARRANT
ID
BE
SURPRISED
THAT
ARCHIVING
DATA
WITHOUT
CONSENT
WOULD
BE
INTERPRETED
AS
ANYTHING
BUT
ANALOGOUS
TO
A
WIRETAP
BY
THE
COURTS
NOTE
THAT
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
I
THINK
IT
WONT
BE
DONE
IF
TECHNICALLY
FEASIBLE
JUST
AS
IM
SURE
MANY
WIRETAPS
ARE
DONE
NOW
WITHOUT
WARRANTS
JUST
TO
FISH
FOR
AVENUES
TO
INVESTIGATE
SO
IN
THE
FUTURE
START
SURVEILANCE
START
ARCHIVING
DATA
TRUMP
UP
SOME
PROBABLE
CAUSE
DECRYPT
POSTFACTO
AFTER
THE
WARRANT
IS
IN
HAND
AND
THE
INVESTIGATION
GETS
A
BOOST
FROM
DATA
THAT
SADLY
WONT
EVER
BE
PRESENTED
TO
A
JURY
WHILE
IM
POSTING
FOR
AN
INTERESTING
CAUTIONARY
TALE
PROJECTING
THIS
ARCHIVING
SCENARIO
TO
EXTREMES
READ
LACEY
AND
HIS
FRIENDS
A
COLLECTION
OF
SF
STORIES
BY
DAVID
DRAKE
THE
US
STARTS
DOWN
THE
SLIPPERY
SLOPE
BY
ARCHIVING
EVERYGHING
BUT
DONT
WORRY
FOLKS
ITS
STORED
IN
A
SECURE
REPOSITORY
WHERE
NOBODY
BUT
LEAS
WITH
WARRANTS
CAN
GET
TO
IT
AND
BY
THE
WAY
WELL
BE
INSTALLING
CAMERAS
ON
ALL
MAJOR
STREETS
HEY
THIS
IS
NOTHING
NEW
WE
ALREADY
HAVE
CAMERAS
IN
BANKS
AND
TELLER
MACHINES
DONT
WE
AND
THEN
WELL
PASS
LAWS
REQUIRING
CAMERAS
COVERING
ALL
PUBLIC
PLACES
THEN
IN
SOME
PRIVATE
PLACES
THEN
WELL
MAKE
IT
A
CRIME
EVER
TO
BE
OUT
OF
RANGE
OF
A
CAMERA
EXCEPT
IN
LEGALLY
LICENSED
PRIVACY
CUBICLES
ONLY
ALONE
AND
WITH
A
THOROUGH
BODY
SEARCH
BEFORE
AND
AFTER
BUT
SEE
THERES
STILL
A
RIGHT
TO
PRIVACY
WE
HAVENT
CURTAILED
ANY
RIGHTS
NOT
REALLY
AND
JUST
THINK
HOW
MUCH
EASIER
ITD
BE
TO
SOLVE
CRIMES
IN
SUCH
A
SITUATION
JUST
OBTAIN
A
WARRANT
PUT
ON
A
VR
HELMET
AND
TAKE
A
WALK
DOWN
MEMORY
LANE
AND
HEY
NOBODYLL
BE
TRACKING
YOU
OR
ME
NO
NEED
TO
BE
SELFCONSCIOUS
AFTER
ALL
IF
YOURE
NOT
DOING
ANYTHING
ILLEGAL
FUNNY
THOUGH
WHILE
SPEEDING
AND
THE
RADAR
DETECTOR
INDUSTRY
BECAME
PRETTY
MUCH
A
THING
OF
THE
PAST
SOMEHOW
ALL
THIS
DIDNT
ELMINATE
ALL
CRIME
IN
THE
STORY
AND
SOMEHOW
POLITICIANS
GOT
EXEMPTIONS
ON
GROUNDS
OF
NATIONAL
SECURITY
AND
RICH
CORPORATIONS
GOT
EXEMPTIONS
FOR
THEIR
EXECS
ON
GROUNDS
OF
INDUSTRIAL
ESPIONAGE
AND
THE
PRESERVATION
OF
COMPETITION
AND
NOT
EVERYBODY
WAS
EXACTLY
HAPPY
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
I
CANT
IMAGINE
