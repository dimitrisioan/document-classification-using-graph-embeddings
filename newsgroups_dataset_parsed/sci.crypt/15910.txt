THE

CHECKING

YET
ANOTHER

IF
WE
ASSUME
THAT
THESE
TRUSTED
AGENTS
ARE
REALLY
ENTERING
A

THAN
USING
THE

ONE
ALL
THE

REDUCE
THE

SEARCH
SPACE

BITS
I
ASSUME
THEY
ARE
NOT
DOING
SO
BY
PICKING
UP
AN
IRON
FILING

POKING
IT
INTO
THE

AT
CAREFULLY
SELECTED

ENCODE

THEY
WOULD

CLEARLY
THE

THE

THERE

A

THE

DETERMINISTIC
FROM

THE

THIS

OSTENSIBLY

MAYBE
SOME
