writes
about
people
so
far
have
asked
once
the
fbi
gets
your
clipper
keys
wont
they
be
able
to
read
all
your
future
and
past
traffic
there
has
been
no
response
from
nist
nsa
ms
denning
mr
hellman
or
anyone
else
who
might
be
able
to
give
us
an
authoritative
answer
this
is
troubling
didnt
nsa
think
about
this
or
is
it
a
feature
and
they
thought
we
wouldnt
notice
i
would
have
thought
that
by
now
they
would
have
responded
with
something
of
the
form
well
that
wont
be
a
problem
because
don
alvarez
posted
a
good
partial
solution
to
this
problem
to
comprisks
ill
present
my
variant
on
it
instead
since
i
feel
its
a
bit
stronger
against
some
likely
attempts
to
cheat
depends
on
the
protocol
thats
followed
for
reading
traffic
briefly
the
cops
get
a
wiretap
warrant
and
record
the
call
they
then
notice
the
encryption
and
the
disclosure
header
it
along
with
a
copy
of
their
warrant
is
sent
to
the
fbi
or
whoever
it
is
who
holds
the
family
key
the
fholder
decrypts
the
header
and
sends
the
serial
number
n
and
the
encrypted
session
key
uk
to
the
escrow
agents
they
in
turn
use
and
to
recover
k
and
send
that
to
the
local
police
note
how
this
solves
the
problem
of
wiretapping
forever
neither
the
cops
nor
the
fbi
ever
see
u
so
they
cant
read
other
traffic
every
request
must
be
validated
by
both
the
fbi
and
the
escrow
agents
the
cops
and
the
fbi
together
cant
cheat
since
they
dont
have
u
i
regard
that
as
a
likely
pairing
of
folks
who
might
try
to
beat
the
system
its
to
prevent
this
that
i
modified
alvarezs
scheme
the
escrow
agents
cant
read
the
conversation
since
they
dont
have
it
all
they
have
is
n
and
uk
and
the
police
dont
even
see
n
its
harder
to
see
how
to
block
decryption
of
old
warrantless
wiretaps
there
is
one
protection
you
have
to
persuade
the
escrow
agents
that
the
call
is
current
but
thats
not
nearly
as
strong
there
are
approaches
i
can
see
that
might
work
involving
sequences
of
data
on
an
unalterable
medium
complete
with
cryptographic
protection
against
insertion
onto
a
new
medium
but
i
dont
have
anything
yet
that
isnt
too
complex
for
comfort
or
too
hard
to
install
in
the
real
world
the
nsa
might
have
an
answer
they
may
or
may
not
be
smarter
than
me
but
ive
been
working
on
this
for
a
week
and
theyve
had
years
