i
also
believe
that
someone
will
reverse
engineer
the
clipper
chip
and
knowlege
of
the
algorithm
will
likely
be
fairly
widespread
any
back
doors
or
weaknesses
would
further
discredit
the
scheme
and
help
grow
the
market
demand
for
a
secure
alternative
i
must
admit
that
this
point
has
been
running
through
my
mind
for
most
of
the
discussion
one
the
dice
are
out
there
it
wont
be
long
before
someone
decaps
it
and
after
a
bit
of
work
has
full
details
of
the
clipper
algorythm
this
isnt
trivial
to
do
but
then
again
it
is
not
impossibly
difficult
either
any
half
way
decent
vlsi
design
student
should
be
able
to
take
a
photograph
of
a
technology
she
is
familiar
with
and
given
a
description
of
the
input
output
control
and
supply
lines
figure
out
the
function
of
various
subsystems
on
the
die
indeed
this
is
not
an
uncommon
exercise
performed
during
training
because
it
makes
you
think
about
design
decisions
made
by
other
designers
i
could
speculate
that
these
chips
are
going
to
be
manufactured
using
tamperproof
carriers
unlikely
such
techniques
are
very
expensive
and
this
thing
is
supposed
to
be
relatively
cheap
to
produce
or
that
there
will
be
some
legal
or
legislative
framework
to
prevent
publication
of
the
algorythm
unlikely
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
but
arent
these
supposed
to
be
sold
internationally
i
suppose
that
the
most
likely
reason
the
algorythm
is
remaining
secret
for
the
moment
is
that
some
idiot
bureaucrat
untrammeled
by
the
realities
of
the
situation
decided
that
well
we
should
keep
it
a
secret
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
secret
isnt
it
just
some
random
thoughts
