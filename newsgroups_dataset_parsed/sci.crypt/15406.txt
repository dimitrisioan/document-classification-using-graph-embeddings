i
received
mail
from
mitch
kapor
saying
that
he
did
not
ask
to
be
on
the
list
and
does
not
know
why
he
was
added
im
sure
the
same
applies
to
others
on
the
list
so
i
guess
my
initial
theory
was
right
that
the
clipper
list
was
just
someones
idea
of
a
bad
joke
i
guess
i
should
be
happy
it
wasnt
a
conspiracy
i
have
also
been
in
contact
with
mitch
about
this
i
believe
him
when
he
says
he
didnt
ask
to
be
on
the
clipper
list
he
also
forwarded
the
traffic
he
had
recieved
through
that
list
to
me
which
will
be
placed
at
some
ftp
site
however
the
first
alias
on
the
clipper
list
was
csspab
which
was
another
mailing
list
it
basically
contained
the
addresses
for
staffers
and
board
members
of
the
nist
security
board
several
of
these
people
had
their
accounts
within
the
dockmaster
domain
these
are
the
people
we
might
wish
