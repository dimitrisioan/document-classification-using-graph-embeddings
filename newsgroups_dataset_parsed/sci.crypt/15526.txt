PLEASE

LETS
ASSUME
A
BRUTEFORCE
ENGINE
LIKE
THAT
HYPOTHESIZED
FOR
DES
MICROSECOND
PER

MILLION
CHIPS
THATS
TRIALS
PER

OR
ABOUT
YEARS
FOR

WELL
MAYBE
THEY
CAN
GET
CHIPS
RUNNING
AT
ONE

PER
NANOSECOND
AND
BUILD
A
MACHINE
WITH
MILLION

SURE
ONLY

YOUR

EVEN
DIGITIZE

BUT
ITS
GOING

IT
IS
HORRIBLY
NAIVE
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
