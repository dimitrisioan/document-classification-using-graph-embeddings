it
would
seem
that
the
one
fact
that
the
government
has
overlooked
in
this
whole
fiasco
is
the
economic
standpoint
as
others
have
mentioned
the
most
difficulty
the
clipper
chip
faces
is
an
economic
one
lets
face
it
the
average
consumer
doesnt
care
or
know
that
the
clipper
is
a
bad
idea
if
there
is
a
perceived
need
for
cellular
encryption
then
the
companies
will
provide
one
most
likely
a
standard
will
emerge
but
if
the
clipper
is
too
expensive
and
a
chip
is
way
too
much
then
they
will
develope
their
own
or
buy
a
cheaper
one
this
is
an
interesting
point
as
a
very
coarse
rule
of
thumb
you
can
figure
that
the
final
price
of
a
product
is
to
times
the
cost
of
goods
the
exact
multiplier
depends
largely
on
economies
of
scale
products
that
sell
tens
of
millions
of
unitsyear
will
be
at
the
low
end
those
that
sell
thousands
of
unitsyear
will
be
at
the
high
end
i
suspect
cellular
phones
are
in
the
middle
this
implies
that
adding
a
chip
would
increase
the
cost
of
the
phone
by
approx
or
about
i
dont
think
youll
get
a
lot
of
consumer
support
for
this
tony
usual
