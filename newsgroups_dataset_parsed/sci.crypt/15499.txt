if
the
clinton
clipper
is
so
very
good
please
note
that
bill
clinton
probably
has
little
if
anything
to
do
with
the
design
implementation
or
reasoning
behind
this
chip
or
behind
any
moves
being
made
using
this
chip
as
a
pawn
remember
when
you
elect
a
president
of
the
united
states
its
not
the
case
that
all
the
republicans
etc
in
the
nsa
and
fbi
and
cia
immediately
pack
their
bags
and
get
replaced
by
a
team
of
fresh
young
democrats
most
of
the
government
say
is
appointed
or
hired
rather
than
elected
since
this
clipper
device
has
been
in
production
for
over
six
months
it
probably
has
little
or
no
foundation
in
the
currently
elected
democratic
executive
body
btw
those
who
suggest
that
this
is
just
an
attack
on
clinton
believe
this
i
would
be
going
ballistic
reagardless
who
seriously
proposed
this
thing
it
is
just
another
step
in
a
gradual
erosion
of
our
rights
under
the
constitution
or
bill
of
rights
the
last
couple
of
decades
have
been
a
nonstop
series
of
endruns
around
the
protections
of
the
constitution
it
has
to
stop
now
is
as
good
a
time
as
any
if
it
isnt
