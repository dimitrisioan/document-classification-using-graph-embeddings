A
VERY
INTERESTING
MESSAGE
IN
WHICH
HE
COMMENTS
ON
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
ON
STATE
AND
LOCAL
POLICE
ACTUALLY
READING
BETWEEN
THE
LINES
IT
COULD
BE
A
VERY
GOOD
THING
FOR
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
IN
ONE
RESPECT
SINCE
IT
WILL
AT
LEAST
PREVENT
COWBOY
COPS
AND
COWBOY
STATE
AND
LOCAL
AGANCIES
FROM
READING
YOUR
TRAFFIC
IF
THEY
TAP
IT
ILLEGALLY
INSTEAD
OF
READING
BETWEEN
THE
LINES
TRY
TO
THINK
A
LITTLE
BIT
OK
IF
THATS
WAY
TOO
DIFFICULT
TO
YOU
HERE
ARE
SOME
HINTS
INDEED
THE
NEW
PROPOSAL
IMPOSES
SOME
ADDITIONAL
BUROCRATIC
BURDEN
ON
THE
LOCAL
POLICE
IF
THEY
BADLY
WANT
TO
TAPE
THE
MAGIC
COOKIE
RECIPIE
THAT
YOUR
MOM
IS
TELLING
YOU
ON
THE
PHONE
SO
GUESS
WHAT
THEY
WILL
DO
PROPOSE
THAT
THE
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
IS
REMOVED
OR
IMPLEMENT
SOME
FACILITATIONS
OF
COURSE
YOU
WONT
WANT
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
THEY
GET
THE
APPROVAL
FROM
TWO
DIFFERENT
AGENCIES
TO
DECRYPT
THE
CONVERSATION
BETWEEN
TWO
CHILD
MOLESTERS
BECAUSE
MEANWHILE
THOSE
TWO
CHILD
MOLESTERS
MIGHT
BE
CONSPIRING
ABOUT
MOLESTING
YOUR
CHILD
RIGHT
SO
THERE
SHOULD
BE
SOME
WAY
FOR
THEM
TO
GET
ACCESS
TO
THOSE
KEYS
QUICKLY
RIGHT
LIKE
THEY
COULD
HAVE
A
COPY
OF
THE
DATABASE
AND
WORRY
ABOUT
A
WARRANT
LATER
I
PERHAPS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CLEARER
AND
MORE
CONCISE
IN
MY
POST
BUT
THATS
WHAT
I
GET
FROM
POSTING
AT
AM
THE
CENTRAL
POINT
I
MADE
IS
THAT
LOCALSTATE
POLICE
AGENCIES
ATTEMPTING
TO
PLAY
BY
THE
RULES
AND
GET
WARRANTS
LEGIT
ESCROWED
KEYS
ETC
MAY
FIND
THEMSELVES
AT
THE
MERCY
OF
BUREAUCRATIC
INERTIA
AND
AGENCY
INFIGHTING
AT
THE
FEDERAL
LEVEL
I
DISAGREE
THAT
THIS
WOULD
ASSIST
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
BY
HOBBLING
THE
COWBOY
COPS
IT
WOULD
BE
A
STRONG
INCENTIVE
AS
VESSELIN
POINTS
OUT
FOR
MORE
POLICE
AGENCIES
TO
GO
ROGUE
AND
TRY
TO
GET
KEYS
THROUGH
MORE
EFFICIENT
BUT
LESS
CONSTITUTIONAL
MEANS
NOTICE
WHAT
THE
RELEASE
SAID
Q
SUPPOSE
A
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCY
IS
CONDUCTING
A
WIRETAP
ON
A
DRUG
SMUGGLING
RING
AND
INTERCEPTS
A
CONVERSATION
ENCRYPTED
USING
THE
DEVICE
WHAT
WOULD
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
DECIPHER
THE
MESSAGE
A
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
OBTAIN
LEGAL
AUTHORIZATION
NORMALLY
A
COURT
ORDER
TO
DO
THE
WIRETAP
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THE
CLEAR
IMPLICATION
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
LEGAL
AUTHORIZATIONS
OTHER
THAN
A
COURT
ORDER
JUST
HOW
LEAKY
ARE
THESE
AND
WHO
KNOWS
WHATS
IN
THOSE
PAGES
THAT
AUTHORIZED
THE
NSA
THERE
MAY
WELL
ARISE
A
BLACK
MARKET
OF
SORTS
WITHIN
POLICE
AGENCIES
IN
WHICH
KEYS
ARE
TRADED
FURTHERMORE
THE
POLICE
WILL
BE
IN
AN
EXCELLENT
POSITION
TO
CARRY
OUT
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
WITHOUT
BEING
CAUGHT
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
A
COMMUNICATION
INFRASTRUCTURE
WITH
SECURE
PORTIONS
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
LAWS
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
THAT
LIMIT
CITIZENS
RIGHTS
TO
ACCESS
POLICE
COMMUNICATIONS
OR
USE
THE
INFORMATION
THEY
GET
IT
MAY
BE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
PROVE
POLICE
MISUSE
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
HAVE
SUCH
EVIDENCE
MAY
ITSELF
BE
EVIDENCE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BROKEN
SOME
OTHER
LAW
THROW
IN
PRIVATE
DETECTIVES
WHO
HAVE
EVEN
FEWER
POLICYCONSTITUTIONAL
RESTRICTIONS
ALSO
CONSIDER
MERCENARIES
WHOVE
RETIRED
FROM
INTELLIGENCE
AGENCIES
WILLIAM
GIBSON
MUST
BE
LOVING
IT
GREAT
STORY
MATERIAL
DONT
THINK
ITLL
HAPPEN
WELL
CONSIDER
EG
THE
MICHIGAN
STATE
POLICE
GENERALLY
A
VERY
PROFESSIONAL
ORGANIZATION
WHICH
FOR
YEARS
KEPT
RED
FILES
ON
THOUSANDS
OF
SUSPECTED
COMMIES
KNOWING
FULL
WELL
IT
WAS
NOT
CONSITITUTIONAL
THE
STANDARDS
OF
EVIDENCE
WERE
JUST
ABOUT
ZERO
PEOPLE
WERE
IN
THE
FILE
BECAUSE
THEY
HAPPENED
TO
PARK
NEAR
A
PLACE
WHERE
SAY
A
USCHINA
PEOPLES
FRIENDSHIP
RALLY
WAS
HAPPENING
THE
POLICE
WENT
AROUND
WRITING
DOWN
LICENSE
PLATE
NUMBERS
IF
YOU
HAPPENED
TO
BE
VISITING
A
FRIEND
WHO
LIVED
NEAR
THE
MEETING
PLACE
WELL
THE
STATE
POLICE
WOUND
UP
FILING
YOU
AS
A
SUBVERSIVE
THEY
WERE
EVENTUALLY
FOUND
OUT
AND
A
COURT
RULED
AGAINST
CARRYING
ON
ANY
MORE
SUCH
NONSENSE
I
BELIEVE
THAY
MAY
HAVE
HAD
TO
DESTROY
THE
TAPES
AS
WELL
EVEN
WITH
WELLMEANING
COPS
AND
IM
SURE
THERE
ARE
MANY
THERE
WILL
BE
STRONG
PRESSURE
TO
BEND
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
SAFEGUARDS
WE
DONT
NEED
TO
ASSUME
CORRUPT
OR
UNBALANCED
OFFICERS
IT
WILL
ALL
BE
IN
THE
INTEREST
OF
ENFORCING
SENSIBLE
LAWS
SAVING
LIVES
AND
PROTECTING
PROPERTY
COMPROMISES
WILL
BE
MADE
BY
WELLMEANING
OFFICERS
FACING
WHAT
TO
THEM
WILL
BE
A
MORAL
DILEMMA
CLIPPER
WILL
MAKE
CRIMINALS
OUT
OF
COPS
DO
WE
WANT
TO
DO
THIS
