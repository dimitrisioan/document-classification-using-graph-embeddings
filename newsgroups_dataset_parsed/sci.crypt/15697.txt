the
date
i
have
for
this
is
note
clintons
statements
about
encryption
in
the
paragraph
i
guess
this
statement
doesent
contradict
what
you
said
though
cut
here
washington
upi
the
war
on
drugs
is
about
to
get
a
fresh
start
president
clinton
told
delegates
to
the
national
federation
of
police
commisioners
convention
in
washington
in
the
first
speech
on
the
drug
issue
since
his
innaugural
clinton
said
that
his
planned
escalation
of
the
drug
war
would
make
everything
so
far
seem
so
halfhearted
that
for
all
practical
i
just
found
out
from
my
source
that
this
article
was
a
joke
heh
heh
it
seemed
pretty
damn
convincing
to
me
from
the
start
i
just
didnt
notice
the
smiley
at
the
end
of
the
article
and
there
were
a
few
other
hints
which
i
should
of
caught
anyway
i
guess
this
joke
did
turn
out
to
resemble
clintons
true
feelings
at
least
to
some
extent
sorry
about
that
