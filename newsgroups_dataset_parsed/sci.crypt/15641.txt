down
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit

would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to

as
far
as
i
know
isdn
call
it
swissnet
here
and
its
being
plugged
in
its
bit
gives
you
one
channel
of
i
guess
you
should
not
go
below
a
sampling
rate
of
hz
if
you
want
to
have
same
quality
as
on
an
analogline
