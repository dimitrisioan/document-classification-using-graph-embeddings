IT
IS
APPARENTLY
QUITE
EASY
TO
GET
HOLD
OF
A
PERSONS
CALLING
RECORDS
THROUGH
THE
PHONE
COMPANY
POLICE
AND
SOME
LAWYERS
ARE
ABLE
TO
ACQUIRE
SUCH
INFORMATION
WITHOUT
ANY
WARRANT
OR
JUDICIAL
SUPERVISION
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
TARGET

SUSPECTED
OF

PARDON
ME
BUT
ISNT
THIS
VERY
ILLEGAL
I
WAS
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
A
WARRENT
IS
NEEDED
TO
GET
THIS
INFORMATION
OUT
OF
THE
PHONE
COMPANY
IN

WERE
OBTAINED

PROBABLE

RATHER
THAN
AS

POLICE
OFFICER
I
SPOKE
WITH
ONLY
A
COUPLE
OF
NIGHTS
AGO
TOLD
ME
THAT
THEY
USUALLY
ONLY
SUBPEONA
THE
PHONE
COMPANIES
RECORDS
IN
EXTREME
CONDITIONS
BECAUSE
ITS
SO
MUCH
OF
A
HASSLE
AND
DOES
THE
PHONE
COMPANY
REQUIRE
WRITTEN
SUBPOENAABLE
EVIDENCE
OF
PROBABLE
CAUSE
IN
ORDER
TO
PROCESS
THE
REQUEST
I
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
OFFICER
WAS
DISINTERESTED
IN
PURSUING
YOUR
CASE
EVEN
IF
YOU
COULD
PROVE
THE
OFFENDER
HAD
CALLED
YOU
AT
A
CERTAIN
TIME
YOUR
CHANCES
OF
WINNING
A
HARASSMENT
SUIT
ON
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THIS
EVIDENCE
ARE
NIL
MY
CONTACT
WITH
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
DEALT
WITH
CASES
OF
EXTREME
PHONE
HARASSMENT
SEVERAL
THOUSAND
CALLS
IN

TEACHES
ME
THAT
POLICE
IN
THIS

ARE
QUITE
LETHARGIC
ABOUT
PURSUING
SUCH
MATTERS
