re
fighting
the
clipper
initiative
as
a
flaming
libertarian
paranoid
extremist
iat
a
loss
for
specific
objections
that
dont
sound
frighteningly
technical
the
idea
that
foisting
the
cripple
chip
standard
on
us
manufacturers
would
result
in
saying
sayonara
to
yet
another
hightech
market
isnt
technical
isnt
in
the
least
difficult
to
understand
and
plays
on
a
concern
lots
of
people
are
worried
about
already
