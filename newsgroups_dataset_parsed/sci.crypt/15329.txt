GETTING
THE
COURT
ORDER
TO
REVEAL
THE
KEY
ALSO
MAKES
DECIPHERABLE
ALL
PAST
CONVERSATIONS
WHICH
MAY
BE
ON
TAPE
OR
DISK
OR
WHATVER
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
PROPOSAL
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
BUT
IVE
SEEN
NO
MENTION
OF
SESSION
KEYS
BEING
THE
ESCROWED
ENTITIES
TRUE
IN
THEORY
IN
PRACTICE
THE
TECHNOLOGY
OF
CELLULAR
PHONES
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
SPREAD
SPECTRUM
AND
QUITE
DIFFICULT
TO
RECORD
THE
CRYPTTEXT
WITHOUT
THE
KEY
IF
THE
FREQUENCY
PATH
DEPENDS
ON
THEY
KEY
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
TO
IT
COULD
BE
MADE
EFFECTIVELY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
RECORD
I
AM
NOT
AN
EXPERT
IN
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
SCIENCE
BUT
SOME
BASIC
THINGS
SEEM
EVIDENT
TO
ME
THINGS
WHICH
THIS
CLINTON
CLIPPER
DO
NOT
ADDRESS
THE
ALL
PERTAIN
TO
OPPORTUNITES
FOR
ABUSE
AND
CONCLUSIONS
BASED
ON
WHAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
MEMBERSHIP
OF
THIS
GROUP
EXCEPT
FOR
TWO
NOTABLE
PERSONS
AGREE
TO
IF
ANYTHING
BAD
IS
POSSIBLE
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
IN
THEORY
IT
ALMOST
ALWAYS
ENDS
UP
HAPPENING
IN
FACT
SO
THE
KEY
IS
TO
MAKE
ABUSE
IMPOSSIBLE
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
AND
REMEMBER
POWER
DOES
CORRUPT
I
THINK
ONE
HAS
TO
REGARD
THIS
WHOLE
IDEA
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
EXPANDED
TO
INCLUDE
OTHER
DATA
FORMS
SUCH
AS
DATA
TRANSFER
AND
STORED
DATA
AND
AS
SUCH
SHOULD
BE
TREATED
AS
IF
IT
WERE
EXPANDED
OR
SUCH
EXPANSION
WILL
BE
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
STOP
USING
CLIPPER
AS
A
PRECIDENT
THERE
WAS
A
HINT
OF
THAT
IN
THE
PROPOSAL
REMEMBER
THAT
SAID
PLEASE
BEAR
WITH
ME
I
AM
NOT
VERY
ARTICULATE
SO
I
TAKE
MORE
WORDS
TO
SAY
WHAT
OTHERS
COULD
SAY
MUCH
MORE
BRIEFLY
THANK
YOU
ONCE
IT
HITS
LAND
YOU
CAN
RECORD
IT
IF
YOU
HAVE
TELCO
ACCESS
THE
TELCO
ISNT
SUPPOSED
TO
GIVE
THAT
WITHOUT
A
WARRANT
THATS
THE
RULE
TODAY
AS
I
SUGGESTED
THIS
IS
NOW
THE
HINT
IS
IN
THE
PROPOSAL
THAT
THIS
OR
SIMILAR
PROPOSALS
ARE
BEING
CONSIDERED
FOR
OTHER
FORMS
OF
ENCRYPTIONS
SUCH
AS
DATA
TRANSFER
DATA
FILES
AND
SUCH
LARGELY
DEPENDENT
ON
HOW
THIS
THING
IS
ACCEPTED
OR
FLIES
I
THINK
ONE
WOULD
BE
WISE
TO
TREAT
THIS
IN
THE
MANNER
ONE
WOULD
WHEN
NOT
IF
IT
GETS
EXPANDED
TO
OTHER
AREAS
THAN
CELLULAR
PHONES
I
THINK
THIS
IS
GUARANTEED
TO
HAPPEN
IF
THIS
PROPOSAL
GETS
BY
SALAMI
POLITICS
IT
HAS
BEEN
AND
IS
USED
IN
SEVERAL
OTHER
AREAS
IT
IS
CERTAIN
TO
BE
USED
HERE
GOVERNMENT
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
EASILY
GIVE
UP
ON
THE
IDEA
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
EAVESEDROP
WHENEVER
THEY
WANT
TO
COURT
ORDER
REQUIRED
HAS
PROVEN
TO
BE
A
RATHER
FLIMSY
GUARANTEE
IF
THE
CASE
WARRANTS
THEY
CAN
ALWAYS
SIEZE
THE
MATERIAL
AND
FORCE
ONE
TO
GIVE
THE
KEY
OR
SIT
IN
JAIL
FOREVER
ON
PERIODICALLY
RENEWED
CONTEMPT
CHARGES
SO
IT
IS
NOT
DENYING
THE
JUSTICE
SYSTEM
THE
INFORMATION
NOR
THE
ABILITY
TO
LOCK
SOMEONE
UP
IF
GUILTY
OR
REFUSES
TO
DIVULGE
THE
MEANS
TO
ACCESS
THE
INFO
THIS
IS
NOT
PROTECTED
UNDER
THE
FIFTH
ONE
CAN
BE
FORCED
TO
PERFORM
ACTS
THAT
WOULD
RESULT
IN
DIVULGING
INCRIMINATING
EVIDENCE
SO
BLOCKING
RESTRICTIONS
ON
PRIVATE
ENCRYPTION
IS
NOT
PREVENTING
LEGITIMATE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
IT
DOES
MAKE
ILLEGITIMATE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
A
BUNCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
ESPECIALLY
FISHING
EXPEDITIONS
WITHOUT
THE
TARGETS
KNOWLEGE
DONT
GIVE
UP
THE
RIGHT
TO
BE
SAFE
FROM
THAT
THAT
SHOULD
BE
NONNEGOTIABLE
AND
CLINTON
AND
CO
KNOW
IT
WHICH
IS
PROBABLY
WHY
THEY
QUIETLY
DEVELOPED
THIS
THING
FIGURING
IF
THEY
GET
IT
THIS
FAR
THEY
CAN
RAM
IT
ON
THROUGH
HOW
COME
THOSE
CONSULTED
COULD
BE
ROUGHLY
DESCRIBED
AS
US
INSIDERS
THEY
CANNOT
QUIETELY
IMPLIMENT
IT
THOUGH
WHEN
THEY
BAN
OTHER
SCHEMES
TO
ENSURE
ITS
EXCLUSIVE
USE
HENCE
THE
NICE
PR
DOCUMENT
TO
TRY
AND
REASSURE
EVERYONE
DONT
BUY
INTO
IT
HAS
GOVERNMENT
REALLY
EARNED
THAT
KIND
OF
TRUST
PAST
OR
FUTURE
TO
BE
SECURE
AND
FREE
ONE
MUST
KEEP
GOVERNMENT
HONEST
AND
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
DO
THAT
IS
TO
MAKE
ABUSE
IMPOSSIBLE
NOT
UNLIKELY
OR
DIFFICULT
BUT
EVEN
SO
THE
EVIDENCE
WOULD
NOT
BE
ADMISSIBLE
I
THINK
UNLESS
THE
JUDGE
SO
ORDERED
I
THINK
THAT
EVEN
INTERCEPTION
OF
THE
CRYPTTEXT
WITHOUT
A
WARRANT
WOULD
BE
ILLEGAL
COPS
CANT
RECORD
TODAYS
PLAIN
CELLULAR
CALLS
AND
THEN
ASK
A
JUDGE
HEY
CAN
WE
HAVE
PERMISSION
TO
LISTEN
TO
THOSE
TAPES
CAN
THEY
SO
WHAT
ONE
COULD
USE
INFORMATION
GAINED
BY
REUSE
OF
THE
KEYS
SAVED
AFTER
THE
LAST
CASE
WAS
FINISHED
OR
OTHER
MEANS
MASTER
KEY
BACKDOOR
EASILY
BROKEN
ALGORITHM
TO
FIND
OTHER
EVIDENCE
WHICH
GIVEN
TO
A
JUDGE
WOULD
AUTHORIZE
A
TAP
WHICH
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
POSSIBLE
OTHERWISE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
THE
MORE
COMMON
MANNER
OF
ABUSE
OF
WIRETAPS
IN
THE
PAST
FOR
LOCAL
COPS
THIS
MIGHT
BE
WORKABLE
TO
KEEP
THEM
HONEST
BUT
THE
FEDS
HAVE
A
WORKAROUND
SOMEHOW
BET
ON
IT
DOES
ANYONE
REALLY
BELIEVE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
USE
A
SCHEME
NSA
CANNOT
LISTEN
IN
ON
SCANNING
FOR
KEYWORDS
EITHER
EASILY
DEFEATED
IN
REALTIME
OR
VIA
A
MASTER
KEY
I
SURE
DONT
THIS
WHOLE
THING
SOUNDS
LIKE
SOMETHING
TO
ELIMINATE
THE
NEED
TO
USE
OLDFASHIONED
POLICE
WORK
TO
BUILD
A
CASE
IN
THE
PAST
EAVESDROPPING
WAS
RATHER
EASY
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
A
COURT
ORDER
I
THINK
THE
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
COMMUNITY
HAS
BECOME
A
BIT
SPOILED
AND
WILL
RESIST
CHANGES
THAT
REQUIRE
THEM
TO
REVERT
TO
USING
OLDFASHIONED
DETECTIVE
WORK
I
JUST
FIND
IT
SOMEWHAT
SURPRISING
COMING
FROM
A
BUNCH
THAT
CARES
SO
MUCH
ABOUT
CIVIL
AND
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHTS
THAT
PUTS
PEOPLE
FIRST
THE
QUESTION
IS
PUT
PEOPLE
FIRST
TO
WHERE
WITH
THE
INNARDS
NOT
BEING
REVEALED
HOW
IS
ONE
TO
BE
SURE
THERE
DOESNT
EXIST
A
MASTER
KEY
FOR
USE
BY
NSA
ETC
SO
THEY
CAN
DO
THEIR
KEYWORD
SCAN
ETC
ON
CONVERSATIONS
THEY
ROUTINELY
MONITOR
WITHOUT
A
SPECIFIC
COURT
ORDER
REMEMBER
THE
CELLULAR
PHONE
LIMITIATION
IS
ONLY
TEMPORARY
BET
ON
IT
AND
SO
FAR
I
HAVE
NOT
HEARD
ABOUT
POLICE
TELLING
PEOPLE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
TAPPED
AND
NOTHING
INCRIMINATING
WAS
FOUND
WHAT
IS
TO
KEEP
THEM
FROM
SIMPLY
KEEPING
THE
KEYS
ON
FILE
FOR
NEXT
TIME
AFTER
AWHILE
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
QUITE
A
COLLECTION
KEPT
ESPECIALLY
FOR
FOLKS
THEY
DEEM
DISRUPTIVE
AND
IF
THEY
GET
ONLY
ONE
KEY
THAT
WOULD
REDUCE
THE
SEARCH
SPACE
A
LOT
UNLESS
IT
IS
AN
RSA
SCHEME
REMEMBER
NIXON
YEARS
NEED
FOR
COURT
ORDERS
REALLY
SLOWED
THEM
DOWN
DIDNT
IT
AND
UNLESS
THE
ESCROW
ACCOUNTS
ARE
NOT
GOVERNMENT
CONTROLLED
FAT
CHANCE
I
SEE
ONE
ENDING
UP
BEING
UNDER
SAY
TREASURY
THE
OTHER
UNDER
JUSTICE
IT
COULD
BE
WORTH
SOME
SERIOUS
BUCKS
TO
SOME
FOLKS
TO
GET
KEYS
TO
A
COMPETITORS
CLINTON
CLIPPER
OR
DESCENDENT
WHEN
THIS
IDEA
IS
EXPANDED
TO
BE
USED
FOR
ALL
NONGOVERNMENT
ENCRYPTION
ENOUGH
BUCKS
WOULD
GET
ONE
THE
KEYS
OR
THE
INNARDS
FOR
THIS
ALGORITHM
PERHAPS
NOT
AN
IMPORTANT
CONCERN
BUT
GIVEN
PAST
GOVERNMENT
BEHAVIOR
AND
THE
OTHER
PROBLEMS
WORSE
OF
COURSE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
THEN
USES
THIS
CLINTON
CLIPPER
TO
ARGUE
FOR
RESTRICTIONS
ON
UNAPPROVED
ENCRYPTION
THIS
IS
THE
MAIN
CONCERN
OF
MOST
OF
US
I
THINK
THE
CAMELS
NOSE
IN
THE
TENT
ETC
YES
THAT
IS
A
MAJOR
CONCERN
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
THINK
THEY
CAN
WIN
JUST
BY
HAVING
OF
THE
USA
USE
THIS
SYSTEM
THEY
DONT
EVEN
HAVE
TO
CARE
ABOUT
THE
CAUTIOUS
THATS
LEFT
THEY
DONT
CATCH
THE
REALLY
SMART
CROOKS
ANYWAY
JOHN
GOTTI
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
RETARDED
NOT
TO
REALIZE
HE
WAS
LIKELY
TO
BE
WIRETAPPED
GLIBLY
CHATTED
AWAY
ON
HIS
TAPPED
PHONE
ABOUT
MURDER
PLANS
THATS
WHY
HES
IN
JAIL
NOW
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
BUT
TRUE
WHAT
WILL
ONE
DO
WHEN
IT
IS
EXPANDED
TO
DATA
STORAGE
ENCRYPTION
YOU
CAN
BET
THAT
IF
CLIPPER
IS
ACCEPTED
THAT
WILL
BE
NEXT
ON
THE
AGENDA
IT
IS
EVEN
HINTED
AT
IN
THE
PROPOSAL
READ
IT
CAREFULLY
EXPECT
THE
ARGUMET
WELL
IF
YOU
GOT
NOTHING
TO
HIDE
FINE
THEN
USING
THAT
ARGUMENT
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
OBJECT
TO
VIDEO
CAMERAS
BEING
INSTALLED
IN
EVERY
ROOM
OF
ONES
HOME
GRANTED
AN
EXTEME
EXPANSION
OF
THE
IDEA
BUT
THE
PRINCIPLE
HOLDS
PRIVATE
STUFF
SHOULD
REMAIN
PRIVATE
EVEN
FROM
A
GOVT
FISHING
EXPEDITION
AND
LAWSRULES
MAY
CHANGE
IN
THE
FUTURE
AS
TO
SAFEGUARDS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THE
FED
GOVERNMENT
SAFEGUARDS
ARE
PRETTY
MEANINGLESS
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
DOGET
SOMETHING
DONT
WORK
SO
HARD
TO
GIVE
UP
SOME
RATHER
TREASURED
RIGHTS
OR
ESTABLISH
BAD
PRECIDENTS
PLEASE
THE
PRICE
COULD
BE
HELL
TO
PAY
LATER
THIS
SCHEME
CAN
SUCCEED
WITHOUT
LAWS
FORBIDDING
MORE
WHICH
PEOPLE
WOULD
FIGHT
A
LOT
HARDER
THEY
LIKE
THIS
ENOUGH
THAT
THEY
ARE
DROPPING
THE
SO
CALLED
DIGITAL
TELEPHONY
PROPOSAL
ACCORDING
TO
RUMOURS
HOWEVER
THE
MEANING
OF
THAT
IS
COMPLEX
SINCE
THEY
STILL
WANT
TO
GET
AT
THE
CRYPTTEXT
ON
TELCO
SYSTEMS
AND
THAT
REQUIRES
A
BIT
OF
WORK
PEOPLE
WOULD
FIGHT
LAWS
FORBIDDING
MORE
NOW
BUT
IN
SAY
TWO
YEARS
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
THIS
CRISIS
SITUATION
WHICH
MUST
BE
ADDRESSED
BY
SOME
DRASTIC
ACTION
JUST
THIS
ADDED
REASONABLE
RESTRICTION
WILL
ONLY
BOTHER
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
SOMETING
TO
HIDE
ETC
PLEASE
DONT
BUY
INTO
IT
IF
THE
CLINTON
CLIPPER
IS
SO
VERY
GOOD
WHY
NOT
MAKE
ITS
ALGRITHM
PUBLIC
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
CAN
EXCHANGE
IDEAS
AND
EXAMINE
IT
RATHER
THAN
A
FEW
ISOLATED
RESPECTED
EXPERTS
RESPECTED
BY
WHOM
FOR
WHAT
PERHAPS
A
CERTAIN
PROFESSOR
WHO
LIKES
KEY
BANKS
WOULD
BE
ONE
OF
THE
SELECTED
EXPERTS
THIS
DOES
SEEM
TO
EXPAND
ON
SOME
IDEAS
THE
PERSON
WAS
ADVOCATING
IF
I
RECALL
HOW
WOULD
ANYBODY
KNOW
THAT
WHAT
THE
EXPERTS
EXAMINE
IS
THE
SAME
AS
WHAT
WILL
END
UP
BEING
USED
IN
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
IF
IT
IS
KEPT
SECRET
PERHAPS
THE
CLIPPER
WILL
USE
A
CRIPPLED
VERSION
WITH
A
MASTER
KEY
PROVISION
OR
FEATURES
NOT
PRESENT
IN
THE
VERSION
SUBJECTED
FOR
STUDY
AND
EVALUATION
BY
THE
EXPERTS
AND
WHO
CHOOSES
THE
EXPERTES
THE
GOVERNMENT
NO
CONFLICT
OF
INTEREST
THERE
AND
ISNT
IT
A
REQUIREMENT
FOR
ANY
DECENT
ENCRYPTION
SCHEME
THAT
IT
NOT
HAVE
ITS
EFFECTIVENESS
REDUCED
BY
HAVING
THE
ALGRORITHM
WIDELY
KNOWN
I
WAS
LEAD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
ASSUME
THE
OTHER
SIDE
HAS
EVERYTHING
YOU
HAVE
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
KEYS
I
RECALL
IDEAS
PRESENTED
TO
THIS
GROUP
ARE
REJECTED
IF
A
REQUIREMENT
EXISTS
THE
ALGORITHM
BE
SECRET
ANOTHER
QUESTION
SINCE
IT
IS
A
SAFE
BET
THIS
CLIPPER
THING
WOULD
NOT
BE
USED
FOR
GOVERNMENT
SECURITY
THEY
ARE
REGARDING
IT
AS
NOT
REAL
SECURE
BUT
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
COMMON
FOLK
I
THINK
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
A
FULL
DESCRIPTION
NOT
A
PR
NONSTATEMENT
OF
JUST
WHAT
GOOD
ENOUGH
MEANS
I
THINK
WHEN
SAYING
HOW
STRONG
IT
IS
GOOD
ENOUGH
REALLY
MEANS
NOT
VERY
THE
EXCUSE
THAT
OTHER
COUNTRIES
HAVE
THESE
RESTRICTIONS
IS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
OTHER
COUNTRIES
DO
NOT
HAVE
OUR
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
AND
CONSTITUTION
WHICH
THE
PEOPLE
NOT
THE
GOVERNMENTS
OF
THOSE
OTHER
COUNTRIES
OFTEN
REGARD
WITH
ENVY
WHAT
WE
HAVE
AS
RIGHTS
THEY
HAVE
AS
REVOKABLE
PRIVILEGES
AND
IF
WE
EXPECT
TO
RETAIN
THOSE
RIGHTS
AND
PROTECTIONS
WE
MUST
NOT
ALLOW
THEM
TO
BE
GUTTED
BECAUSE
WE
JUST
GOTTA
HAVE
THIS
THING
TO
FIGHT
CRIME
WE
HAVE
ALLREADY
HAVE
OUR
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
PRETTY
MUCH
TORN
TO
SHREDS
WE
SHOULD
NOT
PERMIT
MORE
WEAKINING
FOR
YET
ANOTHER
NOBLE
CAUSE
INSTEAD
WE
SHOULD
BE
TRYING
TO
REPAIR
THE
DAMAGE
OUR
CRIME
PROBLEM
MAY
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
CAUSES
BUT
TOO
MANY
RIGHTS
AND
SAFEGUARDS
IS
NOT
A
SIGNIFIGANT
ONE
A
BROKEN
COURT
SYSTEM
AND
POOR
POLICE
WORK
ARE
A
MUCH
MORE
SIGNIFIGANT
CAUSE
AS
HAVING
TOO
MANY
RIGHTS
DISREGARDING
ADDRESSING
THE
ROOT
CAUSES
FOR
CRIME
ETC
BTW
THOSE
WHO
SUGGEST
THAT
THIS
IS
JUST
AN
ATTACK
ON
CLINTON
BELIEVE
THIS
I
WOULD
BE
GOING
BALLISTIC
REAGARDLESS
WHO
SERIOUSLY
PROPOSED
THIS
THING
IT
IS
JUST
ANOTHER
STEP
IN
A
GRADUAL
EROSION
OF
OUR
RIGHTS
UNDER
THE
CONSTITUTION
OR
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
THE
LAST
COUPLE
OF
DECADES
HAVE
BEEN
A
NONSTOP
SERIES
OF
ENDRUNS
AROUND
THE
PROTECTIONS
OF
THE

IT
HAS
TO
STOP
NOW
IS
AS
