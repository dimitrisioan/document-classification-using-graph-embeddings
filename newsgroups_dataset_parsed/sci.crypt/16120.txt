RE
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
LOBBY
AND
IT
IS
US
IN
ARTICLE
NATHANIEL
SAMMONS
WRITES
I
THINK
THAT
MOST
OF
US
CAN
AFFORD
A
STAMP
AND
AN
ENVELOPE
AND
THE
COST
OF
PRINTING
OUT
A
LETTER
IF
SOME
KIND
SOUL
OUT
THERE
WOULD
WRITE
A
LETTER
AND
UPLOAD
IT
TO
THE
NET
EVERYONE
COULD
CAPTURE
IT
PRINT
IT
OUT
AND
SNAILMAIL
IT
OUT
TO
THEIR
LOCAL
CONGRESSIONAL
CRITTER
BTW
IM
WORKING
ON
ONE
DEAR
SENATORCONGRESSMANPRESIDENT
FILL
IN
THE
BLANK
I
AM
WRITING
YOU
TO
VOICE
MY
STRONG
OPPOSITION
TO
PRESIDENT
CLINTONS
CLIPPER
CHIP
INITIATIVE
THIS
PROPOSAL
TO
ESTABLISH
A
SECRET
GOVERNMENT
DESIGNED
CRYPTOGRAPHY
CHIP
WITH
GOVERNMENT
KEY
REGISTRATION
AS
THE
STANDARD
FOR
VOICE
ENCRYPTION
IS
VERY
DISTURBING
THE
IDEA
THAT
CITIZENS
MUST
REGISTER
THEIR
SECRETS
WITH
THE
GOVERNMENT
JUST
IN
CASE
THEY
ARE
TRYING
TO
KEEP
THEM
SECRET
IS
PATENTLY
UNAMERICAN
ADDITIONALLY
THE
PRESS
RELEASE
FOR
THIS
PROGRAM
STRONGLY
IMPLIED
THAT
OTHER
FORMS
OF
CRYPTOGRAPHY
WOULD
BE
BANNED
AFTER
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
STANDARD
IS
IN
PLACE
THIS
LATEST
ATTACK
ON
OUR
CIVIL
RIGHTS
IS
DEEPLY
DISTURBING
AND
IS
FRANKLY
A
VOTING
ISSUE
FOR
ME
THE
PRESIDENTS
PRESS
RELEASE
STATED
THAT
THE
PLAN
STRIKES
A
BALANCE
BETWEEN
THE
LEGITIMATE
NEEDS
OF
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AND
A
CITIZENS
RIGHT
TO
PRIVACY
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
SINCE
OTHER
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
EQUIPMENT
IS
AVALIBLE
THE
CRIMINALS
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
TERRORISTS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
PRESS
RELEASE
WILL
SIMPLY
USE
NON
CLIPPER
CRYPTOGRAPHY
MEANWHILE
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
MAY
GAIN
NO
PROTECTION
AGAINST
WARENTLESS
WIRETAPS
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
SINCE
THE
GOVERNMENT
ESCROWED
KEY
IS
DERIVED
DETERMINISTICLY
FROM
THE
UNIT
SERIAL
NUMBER
WHICH
IS
BROADCAST
BY
THE
CHIP
DURRING
ITS
OPPERATION
THIS
SEEMS
LIKE
AN
OBVIOUS
BACK
DOOR
FOR
THE
NSA
AND
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
IF
YOU
STILL
DO
NOTT
UNDERSTAND
MY
OBJECTION
TO
KEY
REGISTRATION
CONSIDER
THE
WAY
J
EDGAR
HOOVER
BLACKMAILED
GOVERNMENT
OFFICIALS
LIKE
YOURSELF
WOULD
YOU
NOW
USE
A
PHONE
TO
TRANSMIT
PERSONAL
DETAILS
OF
YOUR
LIFE
THAT
THE
NSA
AND
FBI
HAVE
THE
KEYS
TO
WELL
HERES
A
LETTER
I
DIDNT
SPELL
CHECK
IT
SINCE
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
IN
EMACS
SO
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
DO
THAT
