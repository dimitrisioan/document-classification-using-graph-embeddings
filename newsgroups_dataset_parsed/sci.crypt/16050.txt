a
trojan
horse
on
the
clipper
gentlefolk
it
seems
to
me
that
the
step
of
taking
a
warrant
to
the
telco
to
get
a
wiretap
is
so
much
stinky
red
herring
dont
you
love
animal
metaphors
with
each
phone
broadcasting
the
serial
number
of
its
chip
enf
is
not
syntactically
different
than
n
all
they
have
to
do
is
aim
a
reciever
in
the
general
direction
of
todays
target
and
use
the
serial
number
to
identify
the
session
they
want
and
get
the
chip
number
of
the
other
end
of
the
conversation
even
without
the
key
this
is
great
for
traffic
analysis
i
can
think
of
several
ways
to
learn
the
right
serial
number
it
looks
like
one
intended
effect
of
the
clipper
is
to
eliminate
the
awkward
business
of
getting
the
telco
to
cooperate
or
risking
getting
caught
in
the
act
with
your
alligator
clips
erect
this
is
particularly
handy
if
you
have
and
btw
did
anyone
explain
why
they
are
scrambling
the
serial
number
