HOW
WOULD
IT
WORK
WITH
ALL
THE
TALK
ABOUT
THIS
CLIPPER
CHIP
I
HAVE
DEVELOPED
ONE
QUESTION
HOW
DOES
IT
WORK
IF
YOU
USE
THIS
THEN
HOW
DOES
IT
GET
DECRYPTED
ON
THE
OTHER
END
DOES
THE
OTHER
PARTY
RECEIVING
THE
PHONE
CALLMAILETC
HAVE
TO
KNOW
SOME
CODE
TO
UNDO
IT
DO
I
USE
A
DIFFERENT
METHOD
FOR
CALLING
ONE
PARTY
THAN
I
WOULD
FOR
ANOTHER
IF
THE
OTHER
PARTY
CAN
DECRYPT
IT
DOESNT
THAT
MEAN
THAT
SOMEONE
ELSE
COULD
ALSO
I
ASSUME
THAT
IF
EVERYONE
HAS
A
DIFFERENT
KEY
THE
ONLY
USE
WOULD
BE
STORING
SECURE
DATA
FOR
LATER
RETRIEVAL
BY
THE
SAME
KEY
THIS
SEEMS
LIKE
A
FUNDAMENTAL
QUESTION
TO
ME
BUT
I
HAVE
VERY
LITTLE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
CRYPTOSYSTEMS
OTHER
THAN
DES
IF
SOMEONE
COULD
GIVE
ME
AN
EXPLANATION
AS
TO
HOW
IT
WOULD
BE
USED
REMEMBER
THAT
I
HAVE
HAD
LITTLE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
IT
WOULD
BE
VERY
MUCH
APPRECIATED
