WRITES
HAVING
MENTIONED
THE
POSSIBLE
DANGERS
OF
UNWELCOME
POLITICAL
ASSOCIATIONS
I
WOULD
BE
REMISS
NOT
TO
SUGGEST
SOMETHING
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
GATHERING
THE
SUPPORT
OF
THE
NRA
BY
EMPHASIZING
THE
RKBA
SIDE
OF
THE
ISSUE
AS
WELL
AS
THE
FIRSTAMENDMENT
SIDE
HMMM
THIS
GAVE
ME
AN
INTERESTING
IDEA
HOW
ABOUT
THIS
ARGUMENT
SECOND
AMENDMENT
GIVES
US
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
IS
ARMS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
THATS
WHY
ITS
SO
HARD
TO
EXPORT
THEREFORE
WE
HAVE
A
CONSTITUITIONAL
RIGHT
TO
STRONG
CRYPTOGRAPHY
QED
MAYBE
THE
NRA
WOULD
BE
THE
BEST
EXISTING
ORGANIZATION
I
THINK
A
NEW
ORGANIZATION
WOULD
BE
A
MUCH
BETTER
IDEA
AS
THE
NRA
CARRIES
AS
MUCH
UNDESIREABLE
BAGGAGE
FOR
ME
AS
THE
EFF
AND
CPSR
DO
FOR
OTHERS
ARE
ANY
HOTSHOT
REPUTABLE
ORGANIZERS
READING
THIS
MESSAGE
IF
AN
EFFECTIVE
GROUP
COMES
INTO
EXISTENCE
IT
CAN
COUNT
ON
ME
