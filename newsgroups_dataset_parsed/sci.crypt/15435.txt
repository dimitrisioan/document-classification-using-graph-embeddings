know

is
probably
why
they
quietly
developed
this

figuring
if

they

always
amazes
me
how
quick
people
are
to
blame
whatever
administration

current
for
things
they
couldnt
possibly
have
initiated
this
chip
had
to
take
years
to

yet
already
were
claiming
that
the
clinton
administration
sneaked
it
in

us
bullshit
the
bush
administration
and
the
career
gestapo
were
responsible
for
this
horror
and
the
careerists
presented
it
to
the
new
presidency
as
a
fait
accompli
that
doesnt
excuse
clinton
and
gore
from
criticism
for
being
so
stupid
