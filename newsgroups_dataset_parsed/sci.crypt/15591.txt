its
impossible
to
get
approval
to
attach
any
crypto
device
to
the
phone
network
anything
that
plugs
in
to
our
bt
phone
sockets
must
be
approved
for
some
reason
crypto
devices
just
never
are
whats
the
difference
between
a
modem
and
a
modem

device

modems
that
are
approved
either

couriers

someone
tell
me

hardware
compression
is

is
not
needed
to
run
digital
speech
down
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit
samples
would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to
be
g
