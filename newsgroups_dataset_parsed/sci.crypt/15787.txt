ONCE
TAPPED
YOUR
CODE
IS
NO
GOOD
ANY
MORE
MAYBE
SO
BUT
ITS
QUITE
COMMON
THERE
ARE
MILLIONS
OF
MACINTOSH
USERS
WHO
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHATS

MANY
HAVE
MODEMS
CONNECTED
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
ALL
YOUR
BUSINESS
SECRETS
ARENT
BEING
STOLEN
ANSWER
BECAUSE
YOU
TRUST
APPLE
BECAUSE
IF
ANY
SUCH
ATTEMPT
HOWEVER
SOPHICSTICATED
CAME
OUT
IT
WOULD
DESTROY
APPLES
CREDIBILITY
FOREVER
THE
REASON
I
COULD
THEORETICALLY
TRUST
APPLE
THOUGH
IM
A
PC
PERSON
MYSELF
IS
THAT
APPLE
HAS
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
THEIR
CUSTOMERS
DESERTING
THEM
IF
THEY
SCREW
UP
BADLY
ENOUGH
THE
GOVERNMENT
DOESNT
HAVE
ANY
SUCH
WORRY
IT
CAN
CHANGE
THE
RULES
BY
FORCE
TO
GET
THE
OUTCOME
IT
WANTS
THIS
IS
THE
ULTIMATE
REASON
WHY
PRIVATE
ENTERPRISE
IS
USUALLY
MORE
EFFICIENT
THAN
GOVERNMENT
AGENCIES
