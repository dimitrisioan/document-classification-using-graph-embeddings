THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
SYSTEM
DOES
DEPEND
ONLY
ON
THE
SECRECY
OF
THE
KEYS
THE
ABILITY
TO
TAP
IS
AN
INHERENT
INSECURITY
WHICH
DEPENDS
FUNDAMENTALLY
ON
THE
SECRECY
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
TO
SPELL
IT
OUT
BECAUSE
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
MISS
THE
POINT
IF
THE
ALGORITHM
WERE
PUBLISHED
ANYONE
COULD
CREATE
A
CHIP
WHICH
WOULD

CORRECTLY
WITH

BUT
WHICH
WOULD
NOT
HAVE

I
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
NO
TECHNICAL
MEANS
OF
ENSURING
KEY
ESCROW
WITHOUT
THE
GOVERNMENT
MAINTAINING
A

OF
SOME

FOR

THE

COULD
BE
THE

AGENCIES
THEIR
