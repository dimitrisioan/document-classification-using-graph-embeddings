ARTHUR
MELNICK
WRITES
WE
ARE
STRONGLY
OPPOSED
TO
THE
CLIPPERCAPSTONE
CHIPS
IN
A
PRESS
RELEASE
TODAY
OUR
PRESIDENT
DR
STEPHEN
BRYEN
STATED
IT
SEEMS
AS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
AN
UNLIMITED
SOURCE
OF
FUNDS
TO
USE
TO
PUSH
ITS
NEW
BUGGED
CHIPS
ON
THE
AMERICAN
PUBLIC
BUT
DO
WE
NOT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THE
NATIONAL
SECURITY
AGENCY
WHICH
IS
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
INVOLVED
IN
DOMESTIC
SPYING
CAN
FUND
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
COMMERCIAL
CHIP
INTENDED
TO
ACCOMMODATE
US
GOVERNMENT
DOMESTIC
SPYING
ACTIVITIES
WELL
ACTUALLY
THIS
ONES
EASY
ITS
THEIR
JOB
THE
NSA
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DEVELOP
CRYPTOSYSTEMS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
CHOOSES
TO
GO
AHEAD
AND
SELL
THOSE
CRYPTOSYSTEMS
TO
THE
MASSES
SO
BE
IT
THIS
SOUNDS
A
LOT
LIKE
SLAMMING
THE
COMPETITION
NOT
A
CRY
FOR
JUSTICE
THESE
GUYS
ARE
WAY
OUT
ON
A
LIMB
IF
I
READ
THAT
RIGHT
THEYVE
COMMITED
THEIR
NEW
ALGORITHM
TO
SILICON
BEFORE
ITS
BEEN
MADE
PUBLIC
WHAT
ARE
THEY
GONNA
DO
IF
SHAMIR
WRITES
A
PAPER
SHOWING
HOW
TO
CRACK
THE
ENTIRE
CLASS
OF
ALGORITHMS
IN
MINUTES
WITH
A
SLIDE
RULE
AND
A
PENCIL
IF
THEY
WERENT
BUSY
THROWING
MUCK
TO
SMEAR
THEIR
COMPETITORS
ID
FEEL
KINDA
SORRY
FOR
EM
STILL
DO
A
LITTLE
