CAN
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
IF
HARDWARE
COMPRESSION
IS
OR
IS
NOT
NEEDED
TO
RUN
DIGITAL
SPEECH
DOWN
I
THINK
IT
IS
IVE
HEARD
ITS
NOT

WOULD
RAW

RATE
BE
USABLE
IF
NOT
HOW
FANCY
DOES
THE
COMPRESSION
NEED
TO
BE
NOTE
I
AM
NOT
A
CABLE
FREAK
SO
I
MIGHT
HAVE
COMPLETELY
MISUNDERSTOOD
WHAT
YOU
SAID
ALSO
MY
MATH
IS
FREQUENTLY
NOTED
FOR
BEING
WRONG
SO
YOULL
BETTER
CHECK
THE
CALCULATIONS
YOURSELF
I
ASSUME
THAT
MEANS
BITS
SO
IF
WE
ASSUME
ONE

STOPBIT
AND
NO

OVERHEAD
THE

NUMBER
OF
BYTES
PER

IS
LETS
ALSO
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
TRANSMIT
YOUR
SPEECH
IN
STEREO
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
SEND
SAMPLESSEC
THIS
CORRESPONDS
TO
A
NYQUIST
FREQUENCY
OF

WHICH
SHOULD
BE
TOO
LOW
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
THINK
ABOUT
THE

FURTHERMORE
YOUR

WILL
PROBABLY
NOT

YOU
WITH

THAT

WILL
INSTEAD

IN

ALTHOUGH
YOU
CAN
DEFINITELY
BUILD
A

TO
OVERCOME
THAT
PROBLEM
ON
THE

SPEECH
SHOULD
BE
EASILY

FOR

YOU
COULD
FORM

YOU
COULD
SIMPLY

I
