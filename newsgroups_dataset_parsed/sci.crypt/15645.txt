can
someone
tell
me
if
hardware
compression
is
or
is
not
needed
to
run
digital
speech
down
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit
samples
would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to
be
note
i
am
not
a
cable
freak
so
i
might
have
completely
misunderstood
what
you
said
also
my
math
is
frequently
noted
for
being
wrong
so
youll
better
check
the
calculations
yourself
i
assume
that
means
bits
so
if
we
assume
one
start
and
one
stopbit
and
no
protocol
overhead
the
effective
number
of
bytes
per
second
is
lets
also
assume
that
you
do
not
want
to
transmit
your
speech
in
stereo
so
that
you
can
send
samplessec
this
corresponds
to
a
nyquist
frequency
of
hz
which
should
be
too
low
especially
if
you
think
about
the
low
quality
sound
furthermore
your
da
converter
will
probably
not
present
you
with
a
signal
that
has
been
cut
off
at
hz
but
will
instead
alias
in
all
the
higher
frequencies
although
you
can
definitely
build
a
filter
to
overcome
that
problem
on
the
other
hand
speech
should
be
easily
compressible
for
example
you
could
form
power
spectra
or
you
could
simply
bandpass
filter
and
then
linearize
the
fourier
transforms
it
wont
be
cd
quality
sound
but
itll
be
discernible
the
power
spectrum
method
is
very
good
in
that
respect
i
have
once
programmed
such
a
software
compressor
and
compression
rates
of
with
relative
errors
due
to
linearization
of
less
than
were
common
although
i
must
say
that
these
were
musical
sounds
not
speech
have
fun
