NAME
BESIDES
BEING
AN
INFRINGEMENT
ON
OUR
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
NOT
THE
SUBJECT
IN
THIS
POST
THE
NAME
CLIPPER
CHIP
SEEMS
VERY
CONFUSABLE
WITH
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
OF
INTERGRAPH
ORIGINALLY
DESIGNED
BY
A
TEAM
AT
FAIRCHILD
SEMICONDUCTOR
CLIPPER
WAS
A
RISC
MICROPROCESSOR
IT
IS
STILL
USED
IN
SOME
WORKSTATIONS
NOTABLY
THOSE
FROM
INTERGRAPH
THE
SUPPLIER
OF
CAD
TOOLS
INTERGRAPH
ACQUIRED
THE
CLIPPER
PRODUCT
LINE
WHEN
FAIRCHILD
WAS
SOLD
TO
NATIONAL
SEMICONDUCTOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
BACK
WHEN
I
FIRST
SAW
CLIPPER
CHIP
IN
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
I
IMMEDIATELY
THOUGHT
THE
ARTICLE
WAS
REFERRING
TO
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
I
KNOW
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
GROUNDS
FOR
INTERGRAPH
TO
SUE
BUT
THEN
IM
NOT
A
LAWYER
ID
SAY
IM
A
CRYPTOLOGIST
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
INCRIMINATE
MYSELF
