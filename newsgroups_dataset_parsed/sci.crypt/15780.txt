absolutely
i
just
meant
that
no
secure
dedicated
crypto
device
has
ever
been
given
approval
guerrilla
underground
devices
should
be
well
possible
with
todays
highspeed
modems
not
that
i
can
think
of
many
modems
that
are
approved
either
mind
you
just
the
overpriced
couriers
can
someone
tell
me
if
hardware
compression
is
or
is
not
needed
to
run
digital
speech
down
i
think
it
is
ive
heard
its
not
lets
say
bit
samples
would
raw
data
at
the
corresponding
sampling
rate
be
usable
if
not
how
fancy
does
the
compression
need
to
be
it
is
said
that
celp
vocoders
can
run
on
the
highest
speed
with
some
room
to
spare
they
turn
bit
samples
samplessec
into
baud
however
dsp
is
hairy
and
i
have
yet
to
see
actual
proof
of
this
in
the
form
of
an
implementation
i
have
heard
fairly
reliable
rumors
to
the
effect
that
a
famous
internetworking
guru
has
a
celp
implementation
that
runs
on
sparcstation
with
some
room
to
spare
but
i
have
not
succeeded
thus
far
in
getting
my
hands
on
a
copy
the
guru
in
question
has
a
reputation
for
not
releasing
code
without
having
beaten
on
it
for
a
very
very
long
time
first
dsp
experts
are
heavily
encouraged
to
try
their
own
hand
at
this
problem
