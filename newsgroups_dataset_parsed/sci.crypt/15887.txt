even
the
department
of
agriculture
has
successfully
kept
crop
forecasts
from
leaking
prematurely
sheesh
remember
the
big
scandal
a
year
or
two
or
ago
about
exactly
such
leaks
my
choice
for
the
escow
house
would
be
the
smithsonian
and
someplace
on
the
west
coast
my
biggest
concern
isnt
that
the
escrow
house
could
be
compromised
it
will
be
but
the
fact
it
has
been
compromised
will
be
kept
secret
the
keys
could
be
kept
under
glass
with
cspan
coverage
if
you
thought
your
key
had
been
stolen
just
turn
on
the
cable
and
wait
until
the
roving
camera
reachs
the
musuem
case
with
your
key
or
if
you
think
the
cspan
satellite
has
been
compromised
take
a
tour
of
the
smithsonian
yourself
and
view
the
seal
on
your
key
