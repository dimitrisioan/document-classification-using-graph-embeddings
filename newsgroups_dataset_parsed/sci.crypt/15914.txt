WRITES
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
QUITE
DIFFICULT
TO
RECORD
A
MODEM
SESSION
AT
SOME
INTERMEDIATE
POINT
ON
THE
LINE
MAYBE
THEY
HAVE
TAKEN
A
CRASH
COURSE
IN
DATA
COMMS
AND
HAVE
A
UNIT
THAT
DEMODULATES
THE
TONES
AND
STORES
THE
DIGITAL
STREAM
FOR
DECRYPTION
LATER
THIS
WOULD
STILL
SUFFER
FROM
THE
CALLED
BABT
IT
HAS
BEEN
STATED
EITHER
HERE
OR
IN
THE
UKTELECOM
GROUP
THAT
THEY
WILL
NOT
APPROVE
EQUIPMENT
THAT
DOES
ENCRYPTION
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
OR
NOT
BUT
THIS
WOULD
MAKE
A
GOOD
TEST
CASE
PETER
ILIEVE
PETERMEMEXCOUK
YOU
FORGET
THE
OBVIOUS
IF
IT
IS
AN
AUTHORISED
TAP
THEN
IT
CAN
BE
DONE
AT
THE
EXCHANGE
IF
THE
EXCHANGE
IS
DIGITAL
THEN
I
SUSPECT
THAT
YOU
CAN
AUTOMONITOR
A
LINE
AND
PICKUP
THE
FULL
LINK
THEREFORE
SYNCING
A
PIGGYBACK
MODEM
ON
THE
LINE
WOULD
NOT
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
I
SUSPECT
