the
proposal
could
be
modified
so
that
if
they
get
a
court
order
to
tap
you
and
dont
charge
you
with
a
crime
within
say
days
they
have
to
buy
you
a
new
phone
if
they
do
charge
you
and
you
are
found
innocent
they
have
to
buy
you
a
new
phone
yes
but
will
they
buy
you
a
ticket
on
a
time
machine
to
allow
you
to
go
back
and
use
the
phone
with
the
new
key
instead
of
the
phone
whose
key
they
obtained
it
is
unclear
whether
obtaining
the
key
at
time
also
unlocks
messages
recorded
by
whomever
at
earlier
times
the
announcement
was
silent
on
this
the
betting
seems
to
be
that
once
your
key
has
been
obtained
by
the
authorities
by
divorce
lawyers
by
the
mafia
by
the
fbi
by
lost
or
stolen
backup
tapes
by
the
nsa
etc
all
previous
conversations
are
unsecure
session
keys
are
negotiated
but
knowing
the
private
key
is
believed
by
many
commentators
here
to
break
the
security
no
doubt
more
details
will
emerge
doesnt
matter
if
we
assume
they
are
obeying
the
law
since
they
wont
have
had
a
court
order
to
tap
calls
prior
to
the
date
of
the
court
order
and
thus
wont
have
them
available
if
they
arent
obeying
the
law
we
are
in
an
entirely
different
discussion
in
which
this
is
the
least
of
ones
worries
