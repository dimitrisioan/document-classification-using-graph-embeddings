SEEMS
A

EXPENSIVE
HOW
BIG

WHAT

VOLT
OR
VOLT
TECHNOLOGY
HOW
MUCH
CURRENT
WILL
IT
DRAW
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
MANY
PRACTICAL
QUESTIONS
THAT
HAVENT
BEEN
ANSWERED
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
THIS
CHIP
ALREADY
EXISTS
ALL
CLIPPER
CHIPS
ARE
PROGRAMMED
INSIDE
A
SCIF
SECURE
COMPARTMENTED
INFORMATION
FACILITY
WHICH
IS
ESSENTIALLY
A
VAULT
THE
SCIF
CONTAINS
A
LAPTOP
COMPUTER
AND
EQUIPMENT
TO
PROGRAM
THE
CHIPS
ABOUT
CHIPS
ARE
PROGRAMMED
DURING
A
SINGLE
SESSION
THE
SCIF
IS
LOCATED
AT
MYKOTRONX
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
A
SESSION
A
TRUSTED
AGENT
FROM
EACH
OF
THE
TWO
KEY
ESCROW
AGENCIES
ENTERS
THE
VAULT
AGENT
ENTERS
A
SECRET
RANDOM
VALUE
INTO
THE
LAPTOP
AND
AGENT
ENTERS
A
SECRET
RANDOM
VALUE
THESE
RANDOM
VALUES
SERVE
AS
SEEDS
TO
GENERATE
UNIT
KEYS
FOR
A
SEQUENCE
OF
SERIAL
NUMBERS
THUS
THE
UNIT
KEYS
ARE
A
FUNCTION
OF
SECRET
RANDOM
BITS
WHERE
EACH
AGENT
KNOWS
ONLY
OK
IVE
GOT
A
BIG
PROBLEM
WITH
ALL
OF
THIS
HOW
IN
THE
WORLD
DO
YOU
EXPECT
TO
SELL
THESE
CHIPS
FOR
EVEN
AFTER
ALL
THE
OVERHEAD
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
PROGRAMMING
PROCEDURE
PEOPLE
A
LAPTOP
ONLY
CHIPS
AT
A
TIME
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
AND
HOW
LONG
DOES
ALL
OF
THIS
TAKE
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
A
MINUTE
PER
CHIP
IT
WILL
TAKE
THE
GREATER
PART
OF
A
DAY
TO
TURN
OUT
OF
THESE
THINGS
HOW
LONG
DO
YOU
SUPPOSE
IT
WILL
TAKE
TO
PROGRAM
THOSE
CHIPS
MENTIONED
ABOVE
THIS
IS
HIGHLY
IMPRACTICAL
TO
SEE
HOW
THE
CHIP
IS
USED
IMAGINE
THAT
IT
IS
EMBEDDED
IN
THE
ATT
TELEPHONE
SECURITY
DEVICE
AS
IT
WILL
BE
SUPPOSE
I
CALL
SOMEONE
AND
WE
BOTH
HAVE
SUCH
A
DEVICE
AFTER
PUSHING
A
BUTTON
TO
START
A
SECURE
CONVERSATION
MY
SECURITY
DEVICE
WILL
NEGOTIATE
AN
SESSION
KEY
K
WITH
THE
DEVICE
AT
THE
OTHER
END
SO
WHERE
CAN
I
FIND
INFO
ON
THIS
ATT
DEVICE
WHAT
KIND
OF
VOCODER
DOES
IT
USE
DOES
IT
REQUIRE
ISDN
PHONE
LINES
IF
NOT
IS
IT
FULL
DUPLEX
HOW
DOES
IT
SOUND
WHAT
KIND
OF
SYNCHRONIZATION
SCHEME
IS
USED
WILL
ALL
OTHER
LITTLE
BLACK
BOXES
HAVE
TO
CONFORM
TO

CHOICES
