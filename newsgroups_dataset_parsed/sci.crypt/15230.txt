and
this
means
that
the
fbi
will
want
to
track
the
customer
lists
of
better
encryption
phones
because
the
only
reason
a
person
would
want
one
is
to
evade
the
police
then
theyll
probably
also
want
to
start
tracking
the
customer
lists
of
people
purchasing
soundblaster
and
similar
boards
which
can
be
configured
with
the
use
of
some
code
and
a

act
as
a
pretty
decent
digitalencrypting
telephone
its
expensive
though
and
kind
of
awkward
i
dont
know
any
drug
lords
but
im
sure
theyd
favor
something
tappable
over
something
secure
as
long

the
user
interface
is
nice
when
youve
got
hrh
prince
of
wales
saying
stupid
things
over
cordless
phones
its
not
hard
to
imagine
that
drug
dealers
child
pornographers
commies
lisp
programmers
and
other
threats
to
the
civilized
world
might
transact
incriminating
business
over
encrypting
cellular
phones
