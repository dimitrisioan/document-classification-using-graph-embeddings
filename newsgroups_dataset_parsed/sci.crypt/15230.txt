BRAD
TEMPLETON
WRITES
AND
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
FBI
WILL
WANT
TO
TRACK
THE
CUSTOMER
LISTS
OF
BETTER
ENCRYPTION
PHONES
BECAUSE
THE
ONLY
REASON
A
PERSON
WOULD
WANT
ONE
IS
TO
EVADE
THE
POLICE
THEN
THEYLL
PROBABLY
ALSO
WANT
TO
START
TRACKING
THE
CUSTOMER
LISTS
OF
PEOPLE
PURCHASING
SOUNDBLASTER

SIMILAR
BOARDS

ITS
EXPENSIVE

PORNOGRAPHERS
COMMIES
LISP
PROGRAMMERS
AND
OTHER
THREATS
TO
THE
CIVILIZED
WORLD
MIGHT
TRANSACT
