TARGETS
IN

HOLLANDCSCOLOSTATEEDU
DOUGLAS
CRAIG
HOLLAND
WRITES
IM
NOT
A
LAWYER
SO
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
BUT
DOING
THAT
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
OBSTRUCTION
OF
JUSTICE
WHICH
COULD
LAND
YOU
IN
PRISON
FOR
QUITE
A
WHILE
THE
THING
THATS
GREAT
ABOUT
THE
SECRET
KEY
IS
IT
IS
IDEA
ENCRYPTED
SO
EVEN
IF
THE
FBI
DO
GET
THE
KEY
THEYRE
SOL
UNLESS
THEY
KNOW
THE
MAGIC
WORD
IF
THEY
TRY
TO
FORCE
YOU
TO
GIVE
THEM
YOUR
PASS
PHRASE
JUST
SAY
OOPS
I
FORGOT
SINCE
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IS
STILL
ON
THE
PROSECUTION
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
IF
YOU
KEEP
YOUR
MOUTH
SHUT
HOW
CAN
THEY
PROVE
THAT
YOU
DIDNT
FORGET
YOUR
PASS
PHRASE
OK
DOUG
IS
RIGHT
IT
WOULD
BE
OBSTRUCTION
OF
JUSTICE
BLAH
BLAH
BLAH
BUT
SAYING
I
FORGOT
IS
A
LIE
WHICH
IS
JUST
AS
BAD
FROM
A
MORAL
POINT
OF
VIEW
IF
YOU
THINK
LAWFULNESS
IS
A
GOOD
IN
AND
OF
ITSELF
WHICH
ADMITTEDLY
MOST
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BUT
THERES
AN
EVEN
BETTER
WAY
OUT
OF
THIS
PROVIDED
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
PROSECUTING
YOU
CRIMINALLY
YOU
CAN
PROBABLY
PLEAD
THE
FIFTH
AMENDMEENT
AND
THUS
LEGALLY
AVOID
REVEALING
YOUR
KEY
THE
GOVERNMENT
CANNOT
DEMAND
INFORMATION
FROM
A
CRIMINAL
DEFENDANT
WHICH
MAY
TEND
TO
INCRIMINATE
THAT
DEFENDANT
THOUGH
THIS
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
APPLIED
IN
THE
CRYPTOGRAPHY
CONTEXT
AT
LEAST
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
IT
SEEMS
AN
OBVIOUS
APPLICATION
TO
ME
THIS
MAY
BE
A
COMMON
SUGGESTION
IN
THIS
GROUP
BUT
IF
ITS
NOT
IM
NEW
HERE
ID
LOVE
TO
HEAR
WHAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
SAY
ABOUT
IT
SINCE
I
DONT
REALLY
READ
THIS
GROUP
AND
SINCE
THE
SUBJECT
MATTER
IS
MORE
LEGAL
THAN
CRYPTOID
MAYBE
MISCLEGALCOMPUTING
WOULD
BE
AN
APPROPRIATE
PLACE

I
