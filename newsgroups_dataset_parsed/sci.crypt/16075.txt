the
serial
number
will
be
in
a
bit
block
with
a
bit
filler
doesnt
take
a
lot
to
check
to
see
if
that
is
correct
depends
on
whether
the
filler
is
a
constant
makes
checking
easy
but
susceptible
to
replay
or
variable
eg
timer
counter
random
which
makes
replay
harder
and
can
also
make
it
easier
for
the
inquisitors
to
know
if
theyve
missed
messages
or
gotten
them
out
of
sequence
or
other
interesting
things
that
sort
of
person
might
care
about
id
use
a
secret
nope
obscure
cryptographic
encoding
to
expand
the
bit
serial
number
to
a
bit
block
the
redundancy
hereby
introduced
can
be
used
to
detect
tampered
clipper
signals
where
some
public
enemy
replaced
the
le
block
by
random
data
and
of
course
the
le
block
would
be
used
to
initialise
the
encryption
of
the
user
data
so
that
at
the
receiving
end
the
correct
le
block
must
be
processed
in
order
to
have
any
chance
of
getting
the
plaintext
back
for
those
of
you
who
might
want
to
mangle
the
le
block
eg
by
xoring
a
constant
pattern
on
the
transmission
line
and
restore
it
before
feeding
it
into
the
receiving
crippler
chip
i
would
add
further
encrypted
copies
of
this
block
perhaps
created
by
repeated
application
of
the
encryption
algorithm
or
so
at
regular
intervals
during
the
transmission
if
the
receiving
chip
detects
a
mismatch
it
must
assume
that
the
line
is
bad
and
it
will
cease
to
work
in
your
own
interest
you
are
protected
from
getting
faulty
plaintext
you
know
its
just
like
a
checksum
for
your
own
safety
the
monitoring
agencies
wont
have
the
famous
black
box
which
is
needed
for
actual
decryption
and
will
be
kept
by
the
fbi
but
nothing
prevents
them
from
using
special
boxes
which
will
do
the
redundancy
check
for
the
serial
number
block
and
consistency
checks
on
the
embedded
le
blocks
within
the
transmission
these
boxes
will
turn
a
red
light
on
as
soon
as
they
detect
a
bitstream
that
violates
the
correct
protocol
so
dont
anyone
think
that
you
can
use
the
chip
and
fool
le
about
the
tapping
key
i
bet
the
developpers
have
provided
much
better
checks
than
those
suggested
above
of
course
its
absolutely
crucial
that
the
algorithms
and
protocols
remain
secret
personally
i
doubt
they
will
