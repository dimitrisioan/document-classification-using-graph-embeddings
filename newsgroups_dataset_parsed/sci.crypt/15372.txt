the
attorney
general
will
procure
and
utilize
encryption
devices
to
the
extent
needed
to
preserve
the
governments
ability
to
conduct
lawful
electronic
surveillance
and
to
fulfill
the
need
for
secure
law
enforcement
communications
further
the
attorney
general
shall
utilize
funds
from
the
department
of
justice
asset
forfeiture
super
surplus
fund
to
effect
this
purchase
this
is
a
very
curious
thing
to
say
stuiiis
nsadesigned
secure
telephones
cleared
for
classified
traffic
are
already
readily
available
to
law
enforcement
agencies
word
has
it
theyre
standard
in
every
fbi
office
for
example
something
like
several
hundred
thousand
of
these
phones
exist
in
all
they
are
clearly
the
us
government
standard
so
why
does
the
doj
need
to
buy
new
phones
that
unlike
stuiiis
will
not
be
certified
for
classified
traffic
and
in
all
likelihood
will
not
be
compatible
with
existing
stuiiis
unless
of
course
theyre
gearing
up
for
large
scale
decryption
of
civilian
clipper
users
and
they
need
compatible
hardware
