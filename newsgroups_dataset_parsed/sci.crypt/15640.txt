at

theyre

they

feed
lots
of
random
keyinput
pairs
into
the
chip
then
try
flipping
random
key
bits
and
see
what
happens
to
the
output
we
already
know
what
should
happen
about
half
the
output
bits
should
vary
on
average
from
a
key
change
or
input
change
if
they
were
out
to
build
a
weak
cryptosystem
it
might
be
the
case
that
some
of
the
bits
are
much
less
powerful
than
others
in
the
sense
that
they
only
enter
into
the
encryption
very
late
in
the
game
by
contrast
des
was
designed
to
use
each
key
bit
as
early
as
possible
the
output
change
rate
appears
as
early
as
round
again
though
i
dont
think
nsa
is
going
to
cheat
that
crudely
theyre
likely
to
get
caught
consider
a
cryptosytem
that
starts
out
by
xoring
bits
and
and
not
using
either
of
these
bits
except
through
this
xor
this
system
makes
early
use
of
every
bit
but
an
exhaustive
key
search
would
now
only
have
keys
to
search
your
test
by
varying
single
key
bits
wouldnt
turn
up
anything
interesting
remember
that
theyve
promised
to
let
a
committee
of
outside
experts
see
the
cryptosystem
design
if
you
assume
something
deslike
a
biased
subkey
generation
schedule
will
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
the
algorithm
i
suggest
above
would
stick
out
like
a
sore
thumb
but
im
sure
i
could
design
a
system
with
a
more
subtle
key
redundancy
which
was
wellhidden
but
would
still
make
an
exhaustive
key
search
take
far
less
than
encryptions
i
dont
believe
your
claim
that
the
real
keysize
can
be
verified
