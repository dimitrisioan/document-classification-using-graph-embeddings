WOULD
YOU
TRUST
A

FROM

VERSUS
AN

FROM

ABSOLUTELY
IF
I
WERE

BY

I
TRUSTED
THAT
THE

BOX
WAS

SECURE
I
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
CONCEAL

I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
SURE
THAT
ANY
RUSSIAN
JAPANESE
FRENCH
OR
OTHER
COMPETITORS
FOR

CANT

LIKE
TO
BE

THAT
COMPETITIVE

WAS
SAFE
FROM

I
BELIEVE
THE
NSA
HAS
IDENTICAL
MOTIVATIONS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
MY
ACTIVITIES
THE

MANY
OTHER
SENIOR

OFFICIALS
HAVE
MADE
IT
VERY
CLEAR
THAT
THEY
SHARE

THUS
