would
you
trust
a
blackbox
from
the
nsa
versus
an
open
system
from
elsewhere
absolutely
if
i
were
assured
by
someone
i
trusted
that
the
black
box
was
more
secure
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
from
the
government
but
i
would
like
to
be
sure
that
any
russian
japanese
french
or
other

for

id
like
to
be

that
competitive

information
was
safe
from
commercial
competitors
and
foreign
governments
which
would
aid
them
i
believe
the
nsa
has
identical
motivations
with
respect
to
my
activities
the
president
and
many
other
senior
government
officials
have
made
it
very
clear
that
they
share
these
motivations
thus
id
trust
them
on
the
coincidence
of
interests
argument
as
well
as
on
a
basic
trust
in
their
professionalism
and
a
high
confidence
in
their
skills
