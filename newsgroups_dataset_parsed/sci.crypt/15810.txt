I
NOTICED
A
RATHER
DISTURBING
TREND
IN
SOME
OF
THE
EMAIL
AND
POSTS
IVE
TOSSING
BACK
AND
FORTH
SOMEBODY
ASKED
ME
WHAT
WAS
WRONG
ABOUT
OVERREACTING
IN
CASES
SUCH
AS
THIS
THE
REASON
IS
VERY
SIMPLE
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
DIE
IN
A
RIOT
IN
A
NEW
CIVIL
WAR
EVERYBODY
IS
JUMPING
UP
AND
DOWN
AND
SCREAMING
ABOUT
IT
AND
IM
WORRIED
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
REACH
FOR
THEIR
HAMMERS
AND
RIFLES
BEFORE
THEIR
PENS
AND
PAPER
CAN
PEOPLE
WORK
WITHIN
THE
SYSTEM
BEFORE
TRYING
TO
BREAK
IT
A
CIRCUT
COURT
JUDGE
IN
ILLINOIS
ONCE
SAID
WHEN
DEALING
WITH
A
GOVERNMENT
THAT
SEEKS
CONTINUALLY
NEW
AND
MORE
CREATIVE
WAYS
TO
SPY
ON
ITS
CITIZENRY
ONE
CANNOT
DISCOURAGE
THE
MOVE
TO
EMPOWER
THE
COMMON
CITIZEN
WITH
THE
MEANS
TO
PARRY
THIS
ATTACK
ON
PERSONAL
PRIVACY
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
COMMENT
WAS
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
BANNING
OF
RADAR
DETECTORS
THE
POINT
REMAINS
MORE
AND
MORE
I
SEE
THE
GOVERNMENT
SLOWLY
WASHING
AWAY
PRIVACY
EVEN
UNWITTINGLY
DO
YOU
THINK
I
WILL
EVER
LIVE
IN
A
SOCEITY
THAT
ISSUES
SMART
CARDS
TO
CITIZENS
AT
BIRTH
DO
YOU
THINK
I
WILL
LIVE
IN
A
SOCEITY
THAT
INSISTS
I
REGISTER
MY
CRYPTO
KEYS
SO
THEY
CAN
KEEP
TRACK
OF
WHAT
IM
SAYING
EVEN
IF
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
MY
GUILT
DO
YOU
THINK
I
WILL
EVER
LIVE
IN
A
SOCEITY
THAT
SEEKS
TO
MEDDLE
IN
THE
AFFAIRS
OF
ITS
CITIZENRY
WITHOUT
RECOURSE
OF
ANY
KIND
IM
TIRED
OF
IT
THERE
IS
IMHO
NO
COMPROMISE
WITH
AN
ADMINISTRATION
THAT
SEEKS
TO
IMPLEMENT
THESE
PROPOSALS
UNDER
THE
GUISE
OF
ENHANCING
PRIVACY
MORE
THAN
THE
PROPOSALS
THEMSELVES
I
READ
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
THE
PRESS
RELEASES
THE
OBVIOUS
DECEPTION
INVOLVED
IN
PRESENTING
THESE
PIECES
TO
THE
PUBLIC
AND
I
AM
SICKENED
I
AM
REVOLTED
I
AM
REPULSED
PERHAPS
EVEN
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
COULD
CARE
LESS
ABOUT
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
THE
WIRETAP
BILL
THE
SMART
CARD
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
SO
ENTRAPPED
IN
THE
RHETORIC
OF
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
THIS
SADDENS
AND
FRIGHTENS
ME
I
AM
A
CONSERVEATIVE
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
A
LAW
AND
ORDER
CONSERVEATIVE
BUT
THE
MOVE
TO
A
CENTRALIZED
AUTHORATARIAN
REGIME
REALLY
SCARES
ME
MOSTLY
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
YOU
CANT
GO
FAR
WRONG
UNDERESTIMATING
THE
INTELLIGENCE
OF
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
TELL
THEM
ITS
GOING
TO
KEEP
THEM
SAFE
FROM
DRUG
DEALERS
AND
TERRORISTS
AND
THEY
WILL
LET
YOU
PUT
CAMERAS
IN
THEIR
HOME
EVEN
IN
THE
WAKE
OF
WACO
YOU
FIND
THOSE
WHO
SUPPORT
THE
INCREASINGLY
TOTALATARIAN

SOMEBODY
ONCE
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
ARMED
VIOLENCE
IS
MEANT
ONLY
TO
BE
USED
IN
RESPONSE
TO
AN
ARMED
ATTACK
IT
IS
NOT
MEANT
TO
BE
USED
IN

THIS
IS
THE

BETWEEN
SELFDEFENCE
