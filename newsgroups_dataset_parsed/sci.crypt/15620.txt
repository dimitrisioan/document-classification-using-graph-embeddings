YOU

TRANSMIT
THE

AT

ALL
WOULD
BE

DO
THE

ONLY
APPLY

ALSO
TO
THE

OR
IF
THE

IS
ONLY
TRANSMITTED
AT

DOES
IT
GET
INCORPORATED
INTO

THROUGH

MODES
BUT
NOT
DURING

MODE
DOES
THE

CHECK
THE
WIRETAP
BLOCK
ITSELF
DOES
THE
BLOCK
HAVE
TO
BE
PRESENT
AT
ALL
SINCE
THE
RECEIVING
CHIP
DOESNT
KNOW
THE
TRANSMITTERS
U
IT
PRESUMABLY
CANT
CHECK
THE
VALIDITY
OF
EKU
SO
ITS
LIMITED
TO
CHECKING
THE
FORM
OF
THE
WIRETAP
BLOCK
AND
MAYBE
CHECKING
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
FOR
REASONABLENESS
UNLESS
THERES
SOME
SORT
OF
BACKDOOR
STRUCTURE
THAT
LETS
IT
RECOGNIZE
A
VALID
EKU
IN
THAT
CASE
CAN
YOU
REPLACE
THE
WIRETAP
BLOCK
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
WIRETAP
BLOCK
PRESUMABLY
AN
OLD
VALID
ONE
TO
AVOID
ATTRACTING
ATTENTION
THE
CHIP
WONT
DO
IT
SO
YOU
POSTPROCESS
THE

REGULAR
PEOPLE
CAN
DO
ONE
WITH
THEIR
OWN
SERIAL

AND
A
DUMMY
KEY
PARANOID
PEOPLE
CAN
USE
SOMEONE
ELSES
SERIAL
NUMBER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
I
COULD
THINK
OF
THAT
SOLUTION
SO
EASILY
PRESUMABLY
THE
NSA
COULD
TOO
HAVE
THEY
DONE
SOMETHING
TO

IT
