skipjack
mostly
omitted
chip
structure
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
throughput
is
mbits
a
second
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages
encrypted
with
the
chip
the
key
k
and
message
stream
m
ie
digitized
voice
are
then
fed
into
the
clipper
chip
to
produce
two
values
em
k
the
encrypted
message
stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a
law
enforcement
block
three
questions
it
looks
like
each
bits
of
input
gives
you
bits
of
output

bits
do
you
really
need
to
transmit
all
bits
each
time
or
do
you
only
transmit
the
bits
of
wiretap
block
at
the
beginning
all
would
be
really
obnoxious
for
bandwidthlimited
applications
like
cellular
phones
or
even
regular
phones
over
how
do
the
des
modes
interact
with
the
twopart
output
do
the
various
feedback
modes
only
apply
to
the
message
block
or
also
to
the
wiretap
block
or
if
the
wiretap
block
is
only
transmitted
at
the
beginning
does
it
get
incorporated
into
everything
through
feedback
modes
but
not
during
ecb
mode
does
the
clipper
chip
check
the
wiretap
block
itself
does
the
block
have
to
be
present
at
all
since
the
receiving
chip
doesnt
know
the
transmitters
u
it
presumably
cant
check
the
validity
of
eku
so
its
limited
to
checking
the
form
of
the
wiretap
block
and
maybe
checking
the
serial
number
for
reasonableness
unless
theres
some
sort
of
backdoor
structure
that
lets
it
recognize
a
valid
eku
in
that
case
can
you
replace
the
wiretap
block
with
a
different
wiretap
block
presumably
an
old
valid
one
to
avoid
attracting
attention
the
chip
wont
do
it
so
you
postprocess
the
output
regular
people
can
do
one
with
their
own
serial
number
and
a
dummy
key
paranoid
people
can
use
someone
elses
serial
number
on
the
other
hand
if
i
could
think
of
that
solution
so
easily
presumably
the
nsa
could
too
have
they
done
something
to
block
it
like
use
message
encryption
thats
really
em
kun

pray

peace
