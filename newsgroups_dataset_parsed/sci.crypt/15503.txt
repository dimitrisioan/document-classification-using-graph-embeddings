METZGER
WRITES
IF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
CAN
DO
CHEAP
CRYPTO
FOR
THE
MASSES
OBVIOUSLY
ONE
COULD
DO
THE
SAME
THING
WITHOUT
BUILDING
IN
BACK
DOORS
I
AGREE
SO
WHY
IS
CYLINK
THE
ONLY
AND
EXPENSIVE
GAME
IN
TOWN
NOTE
I
THINK
CYLINK
IS
GREAT
AND
IF
MY
BOSS
WOULD
DOUBLE
MY
SALARY
ID
BUY
A
BUNCH
OF
THEIR
STUFF
ONE
THING
THAT
CLIPPER
OFFERS
IS
INTEROPERABILITY
AT
A
HIGHER
DEGREE
OF
SECURITY
THAN
WE
CURRENTLY
HAVE
IN
NONPROPRIETARY
VOICE
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEMS
THIS
MEANS
IT
WILL
BE
CHEAPER
THAN
ANYONES
PROPRIETARY
SCHEME
AND
EASIER
TO
DEPLOY
THIS
IS
OF
COURSE
EITHER
A
BUG
OR
A
FEATURE
DEPENDING
ON
HOW
YOU
LOOK
AT
IT
INDEED
EVEN
WITHOUT
SPECIAL
ENGINEERING
YOU
CAN
CONSTRUCT
A
GOOD
SYSTEM
RIGHT
NOW
A
STANDARD
CODEC
CHIP
A
CHIP
TO
DO
VOCODING
A
DES
CHIP
A
INTEGRATED
MODEM
MODULE
AND
A
SMALL
PROCESSOR
TO
DO
GLUE
WORK
ARE
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
HAVE
A
SECURE
PHONE
GREAT
WHERE
CAN
I
BUY
IT
ANOTHER
NOTE
IF
CLIPPER
INCREASES
THE
INCENTIVE
TO
BRING
STRONGER
ENCRYPTION
TO
THE
MASS
MARKET
ALL
THE
BETTER
ITS
FAR
OVERPRICED
AT
THE
MOMENT
YES
CHEAP
CRYPTO
IS
GOOD
BUT
WE
DONT
NEED
IT
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
I
DONT
CARE
WHERE
WE
NEED
TO
GET
IT
FROM
I
CARE
WHERE
WE
CAN
GET
IT
FROM
AND
WHETHER
IT
WILL
INTEROPERATE
WITH
EVERYONE
ELSE
INDEED
WERE
IT
NOT
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
DOING
EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE
TO
STOP
THEM
QUALCOMM
WOULD
HAVE
DESIGNED
STRONG
ENCRYPTION
RIGHT
IN
TO
THE
CDMA
CELLULAR
PHONE
SYSTEM
THEY
ARE
PIONEERING
WERE
IT
NOT
FOR
THE
NSA
AND
COMPANY
CHEAP
ENCRYPTION
SYSTEMS
WOULD
BE
EVERYWHERE
AS
IT
IS
THEY
TRY
EVERY
TRICK
IN
THE
BOOK
TO
STOP
IT
HAD
IT
NOT
BEEN
FOR
THEM
IM
SURE
CHEAP
SECURE
PHONES
WOULD
BE
OUT
RIGHT
NOW
YOU
CAN
BUILD
THEM
RIGHT
NOW
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
EXPORT
A
RESTRICTION
I
FIRMLY
OPPOSE
THE
ONLY
THING
STOPPING
PEOPLE
FROM
MAKING
CHEAP
ENCRYPTION
IS
GREED
THEY
WANT
A
LOCK
ON
THE
MARKET
THEY
ARENT
THE
ONES
MAKING
CHEAP
CRYPTO
AVAILABLE
THEY
ARE
THE
ONES
KEEPING
CHEAP
CRYPTO
OUT
OF
PEOPLES
HANDS
WHEN
THEY
HAND
YOU
A
CLIPPER
CHIP
WHAT
YOU
ARE
GETTING
IS
A
MESS
OF
POTTAGE
YOUR
PRIZE
FOR
HAVING
TRADED
IN
YOUR
BIRTHRIGHT
OH
COME
ON
ONLY
IF
YOU
TRUST
IT
FARTHER
THAN
IT
DESERVES
A
CLIPPER
PHONE
IS
NOT
A
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
A
CYLINK
PHONE
OR
A
STUIII
ITS
A
SUBSTITUTE

SCRAMBLERS
ADVERTISED

ARE
WE
GETTING
CHEAPER
CRYPTO
FOR
OURSELVES
NO
BECAUSE
THE

WOULD
HAVE
PROVIDED
THAT
ON
ITS

HAD
THEY
NOT
DELIBERATELY
SABOTAGED
IT
I
DISAGREE
MODULO
ITAR
ITS
NOT
THE

THAT
HAS
SABOTAGED
THE

EXACTLY
WE
