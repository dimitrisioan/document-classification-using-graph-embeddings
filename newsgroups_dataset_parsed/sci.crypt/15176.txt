WHY

UNIMPORTANT
ON

THE

OF

IS
CLOSELY
INTERTWINED
WITH

PRIVACY
AND

WHICH
IN

ARE
ALL
CRITICAL
ASPECTS
OF
COMPUTER
NETWORKS
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
CONVENIENCE
OF
COMMUNICATION
AFFORDED
BY

WOULD
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
WITHOUT
CONVENTIONS
FOR
IDENTIFICATION
BUT
THERE
ARE
MANY
POTENTIAL
ABUSES
OF
IDENTITY
POSSIBLE
THAT
CAN
HAVE
VERY
SEVERE
CONSEQUENCES
WITH
MASSIVE
COMPUTER
NETWORKS
AT
THE
FOREFRONT
OF
THE
ISSUE
WHICH
CAN
POTENTIALLY
EITHER
EXACERBATE
OR
SOLVE
THESE
PROBLEMS
VERIFYING
THAT
AN
IDENTITY
IS
CORRECT
IS
CALLED
AUTHENTICATION
AND
ONE
CLASSIC
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
IT
IS
HGWELLS
WAR
OF
THE
WORLDS
RADIO

THAT
FOOLED

HOAXES

FORGED

MAKES
THEM
MORE
INSIDIOUS

HOWEVER
THE

FOR
SOME
ONE
OF

JUST
AS

ON

TO

THAT
