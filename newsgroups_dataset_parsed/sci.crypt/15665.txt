one
thing
that
clipper
offers
is
interoperability
at
a
higher
degree
of
security
than
we
currently
have
in
nonproprietary
voice
encryption
systems
this
means
it
will
be
cheaper
than
anyones
proprietary
scheme
and
easier
to
probably
cheaper
than
you
think
ill
bet
some
of
my
and
yours
tax
dollars
become
a
subsidy
for
these
chips
if
these
chips
dont
sell
well
whats
to
stop
the
us
government
from
giving
them
away
in
the
interest
of
national
security
deploy
this
is
of
course
either
a
bug
or
a
feature
depending
on
how
you
look
at
it
