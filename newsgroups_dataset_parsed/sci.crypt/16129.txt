I
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
NO
TECHNICAL
MEANS
OF
ENSURING
KEY
ESCROW
WITHOUT
THE
GOVERNMENT
MAINTAINING
A
SECRET
OF
SOME
KIND
NOT
NECESSARILY
FOR
INSTANCE
IN
THE
SYSTEM
OUTLINED
IN
THE
MAY
ISSUE
OF
BYTE
THE
PROCESS
OF
GETTING
ONES
PUBLIC
KEY
LISTED
FOR
GENERAL
USE
INVOLVES
GIVING
PIECES
OF
YOUR
PRIVATE
KEY
TO
ESCROW
AGENCIES
WHICH
DO
CALCULATIONS
ON
THOSE
PIECES
AND
FORWARD
THE
RESULT
TO
THE
PUBLISHERS
OF
THE
PUBLIC
KEY
DIRECTORY
WHICH
COMBINES
THESE
RESULTS
INTO
YOUR
LISTED
PUBLIC
KEY
IF
YOU
TRY
TO
GIVE
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
PIECES
WHICH
DONT
YIELD
YOUR
PRIVATE
KEY
WHEN
THEY
ARE
ALL
PUT
TOGETHER
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
THE
PUBLIC
KEY
LISTED
FOR
YOU
IS
WRONG
AND
YOU
CANT
READ
MESSAGES
ENCRYPTED
TO
YOU
