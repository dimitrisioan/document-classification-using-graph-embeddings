i
noticed
a
rather
disturbing
trend
in
some
of
the
email
and
posts
ive
tossing
back
and
forth
somebody
asked
me
what
was
wrong
about
overreacting
in
cases
such
as
this
the
reason
is
very
simple
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
die
in
a
riot
in
a
new
civil
war
everybody
is
jumping
up
and
down
and
screaming
about
it
and
im
worried
that
people
are
going
to
reach
for
their
hammers
and
rifles
before
their
pens
and
paper
well
i
know
one
person
who
is
ready
to
kill
me
and
the
victim
is
this
