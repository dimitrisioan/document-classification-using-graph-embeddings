KEN

WRITES
IMAGINE
ARCHIVING
ALL
PAYPHONE
CONVERSATIONS
SO
IF
SOMEONE
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
A
DRUG
DEALER
YOU
CAN
LISTEN
TO
ALL
THEIR
PAST
DRUG
DEALS
AND
ARCHIVE
CALLS
TOFROM
SUSPECTED

RADICALS
ETC
IMAGINE
THE
CONVENIENCE
FOR
THE
POLICE
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
GET
A
WARRANT
NOW
AND
LISTENING
TO
ALL
THE
CALLS
THE
WORLD
TRADE
CENTER
BOMBERS
MADE
IN
THE
PAST
YEAR
SINCE
ARCHIVING
WOULD
BE
SUCH
A
POWERFUL
TOOL
AND
SO
EASY
TO
DO
WHY
WOULDNT
IT
HAPPEN
APART
FROM
THE
STORAGE
AND
SEARCH
REQUIREMENTS
BECAUSE
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
INADMISSIBLE
WIRETAPS
REQUIRE
A
WARRANT
AND
AS
SOON
AS
ONE
SUCH
CASE
COMES

LIGHT

LIKELY
TO
BE
DISCOVERED
AND
THROWN
OUT

AN
ARTICLE
IN
THE
NY
TIMES
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
ABOUT
HOW
MANY
CONVICTIONS
IN
THE
STATE
MIGHT
BE
INVALIDATED
BECAUSE
THEY
RELIED
ON
PEN
REGISTERS
AND
THE
COURT
OF
APPEALS
RULED
THAT
PEN
REGISTERS
WERE
EQUIVALENT
TO
WIRETAPS
AND
HENCE
REQUIRED
WARRANTS
UNDER
NEW
YORK
LAW
