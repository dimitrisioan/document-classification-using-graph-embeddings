WROTE
AS
A
PRIVATE
CITIZEN
I
WOULD
FEEL
MUCH
MORE
SECURE
IN
MY
PERSON
AND
PAPERS
KNOWING
THAT
AN
ORGANIZATION
COMMITTED
TO
INDIVIDUAL
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
NRA
COME
TO
MIND
WAS
SAFEGUARDING
HALF
OF
MY
KEY
BOTH
THE
ACLU
AND
THE
NRA
ARE
RESISTENT
TO
GOVERNMENT
PRESSURE
BY
THE
SIMPLE
EXPEDIENT
FACT
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
SUPPORTED
FUNDED
OR
OVERTLY
CONTROLLED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
THATS
ONE
PROBLEM
THAT
HAS
SO
FAR
BEEN
OVERLOOKED
THESE
TWO
ESCROW
AGENCIES
WILL
HAVE
TO
CREATE
A
SECURE
DATABASE
AND
SERVICE
THE
INPUT
AND
OUTPUT
OF
KEYS
WHO
PAYS
FOR
THIS
IF
THEY
REFUSE
AN
ILLEGAL
REQUEST
FROM
SOME
CONGRESSMAN
TO
DELIVER
A
KEY
CAN
THEIR
BUDGET
BY
CUT
TO
PUNISH
THEM
WILL
CONGRESS
BE
FORCED
TO
FUND
THEM
FOREVER
CONGRESS
ISNT
FORCED
TO
DO
ANYTHING
NOT
EVEN
FOLLOW
THEIR
OWN
RULES
IF
IT
ISNT
EXPEDIENT
IF
CAUGHT
WITH
THEIR
COLLECTIVE
PANTS
DOWN
THEY
MAKE
SOME
FUNNY
NOISES
PERHAPS
CRUCIFY
A
SKAPEGOAT
OR
TWO
THEN
CONTINUE
BUSINESS
AS
USUAL
I
NOTICE
THOSE
SENATORS
INVOLVED
WITH
THE
SL
SCANDAL
WERENT
HURT
TOO
MUCH
IF
AT
ALL
DECONCINIS
PERSONAL
STAKE
IN
SUPPLIERS
TO
THOSE
BIG
AEROSTATS
HASNT
AFFECTED
HIS
CREDIBILITY
AT
ALL
INSIDE
CONGRESS
AT
LEAST
HE
IS
STILL
PUSHING
HIS
POLICE
STATE
AGENDA
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
LAWS
CAN
CHANGE
CONGRESS
MAY
PASS
A
LAW
SETTING
UP
AN
ESCROW
AGENCY
WITH
INSTRUCTIONS
THAT
KEYS
ARE
PRIVATE
SOME
FUTURE
CONGRESS
MAY
CHANGE
THAT
LAW
SUPPOSE
PRENAZI
GERMANY
HAD
A
CLIPPER
SYSTEM
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
ESCROW
AGENCIES
WOULD
HAVE
TOLD
HITLER
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
THE
KEYS
WITHOUT
A
VALID
COURT
ORDER
IT
WILL
BE
LIKE
THE
OLD
SAW
IN
NEW
JERSEY
AND
NEW
YORK
CHICAGO
ETC
WHEN
THE
POLITICIANS
PROMISED
THAT
THIS
SPIFFY
NEW
GUN
REGISTRATION
LAW
WILL
NOT
BE
USED
FOR
FUTURE
CONFISCATION
PURPOSES
SURE
ENOUGH
A
FEW
YEARS
LATER
WHEN
THEY
WERE
USED
JUST
FOR
THAT
PURPOSE
AND
FOLKS
COMPLAINED
THE
RESPONSE
WAS
WELL
I
DIDNT
MAKE
THAT
PROMISE
SOME
POLITICIANS
MAY
NOT
EVEN
WAIT
A
FEW
YEARS
ESCROWED
KEYS
WOULD
HAVE
THE
SAME
ASSURANCES
OF
SECURITY
BESIDES
IF
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
SNOOP
HOW
ARE
YOU
TO
KNOW
YOU
DONT
THINK
THEY
WILL
SEND
YOU
A
LETTER
SAYING
WE
ARE
NOW
SNOOPING
ON
YOUR
PRIVATE
CONVERSATIONS
DO
YOU
WHAT
ARE
THE
ASSURANCES
THE
ESCROW
PEOPLE
WILL
NOT
BE
FORBIDDEN
TO
REPORT
ANY
ACCESS
ATTEMPTS
FOR
ONES
KEYS
SO
MUCH
FOR
GOVERNMENT
ASSURANCES
OF
PRIVACY
IN
EFFECT
YOU
MUST
SET
UP
ESCROW
AGENCIES
AS
A
FOURTH
BRANCH
OF
THE
GOVERMENT
AND
ISOLATE
THEM
FROM
ANY
OUTSIDE
INTERFERANCE
THEY
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
DIRECTLY
TAP
INTO
FEDERAL
FUNDS
WITH
NO
ACCOUNTABILITY
TO
ANYONE
EXCEPT
THROUGH
A
COURT
CHALLENGE
HOW
THE
FEDS
WILL
JUST
CHANGE
THE
LAW
OR
JUST
IGNORE
IT
NOTHING
NEW
HERE
THEY
GOT
THE
MUSCLE
THE
RESOURCES
THE
GUNS
AS
AN
ASIDE
SINCE
EXPORT
OF
CRYPTO
IS
VERBOTEN
BECAUSE
OF
ITAR
SHOULDNT
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
ALSO
COME
INTO
PLAY
