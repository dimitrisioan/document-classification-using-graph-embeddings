gasp
ive
just
spent
hours
catching
up
on
scicrypt
here
slow
reader
i
guess
and
i
really
have
to
put
out
a
few
comments
too
first
let
me
flame
the
famous
dave
s
hes
obviously
only
years
old
cut
him
some
slack
the
joke
about
clintoncryptodrugs
slammed
me
thru
the
roof
nice
job
guys
ive
been
working
on
marijuana
legalization
for
over
years
now
clintons
actions
so
far
have
really
helped
but
because
of
government
action
taken
against
various
other
groups
i
have
developed
a
bit
des
based
on
public
literature
to
protect
my
mailing
list
the
sboxes
are
the
critical
component
and
since
i
chose
out
of
based
on
the
key
cracking
this
des
is
going
to
tough
the
reason
it
slows
you
down
a
touch
is
that
for
each
key
you
try
you
need
to
use
a
different
set
of
sboxes
i
know
its
only
a
vector
but
it
sure
makes
random
search
a
pain
several
marijuana
legalization
groups
have
had
their
mailing
lists
confiscated
when
people
were
charged
with
drug
usesales
its
not
a
crime
to
be
a
member
of
a
legalization
org
but
you
will
be
watched
it
really
is
important
to
write
a
letter
to
every
official
you
personally
vote
for
to
explain
why
your
privacy
is
being
destroyed
by
the
cripple
chip
amazingly
enough
they
do
listen
when
they
get
enough
mail
the
doonsbery
jokes
about
nra
postcards
are
real
and
the
imi
illinois
marijuana
initiative
has
grown
to
the
point
where
we
are
seeing
some
changes
its
pretty
clear
that
all
the
hullabaloo
is
really
about
the
implimentation
decision
being
made
behind
our
backs
as
vesselin
points
out
this
was
common
practice
in
communist
regimes
and
may
be
again
depending
on
how
the
vote
goes
but
just
as
criminals
have
guns
and
law
abiding
citizens
dont
and
criminals
like
me
have
marijuana
and
law
abiding
subjects
dont
criminals
like
me
will
have
secure
crypto
while
law
abiding
robots
dont
pgp
is
nice
but
as
time
goes
on
we
all
can
do
better
and
to
save
our
hides
we
will
someone
posted
an
excerpt
from
machiavelli
hes
my
favorite
dude
years
ago
he
saw
clearly
how
people
are
and
tried
to
explain
that
to
princes
who
wanted
people
to
obey
one
section
not
quoted
ive
got
the
prince
at
home
so
ill
just
paraphrase
had
to
do
with
conquring
a
free
city
the
only
way
is
to
completly
destroy
it
failing
that
you
must
appoint
locals
to
high
positions
and
accept
the
peoples
customs
even
after
years
of
oppression
a
people
will
remember
their
heratige
and
rise
up
to
overthrow
the
oppresive
government
and
he
gave
an
example
and
that
was
years
before
thomas
jefferson
there
were
questions
about
watching
traffic
only
interesting
traffic
is
watched
stuff
that
goes
overseas
and
comes
back
stuff
with
keywords
like
marijauana
cryptography
nsa
certain
individuals
who
are
known
subversives
etc
it
is
easy
enough
to
store
all
that
traffic
so
if
you
know
how
to
be
subversive
ie
how
to
be
unseen
its
pretty
easy
to
go
unnoticed
for
a
long
time
the
stronger
your
crypto
system
and
the
less
youre
noticed
the
better
your
chances
of
developing
an
organization
which
can
diseminate
truth
to
the
masses
which
gets
me
to
the
thread
about
a
public
encrypted
conference
thats
just
silly
the
first
thing
the
feds
do
is
send
in
an
infiltrator
like
dave
s
and
they
know
what
youre
doing
it
will
be
fun
for
teenagers
and
college
students
but
for
the
real
world
its
pretty
pointless
crypto
is
useful
for
more
things
than
hiding
where
you
get
your
marijuana
guns
drugs
and
crypto
do
have
some
commonality
there
are
people
in
government
who
want
you
to
obey
their
rules
as
lundquist
says
in
altdrugs
live
free
or
dont
machiavelli
pointed
out
thats
just
how
most
people
actually
live
inspite
of
appearences
to
the
contrary
its
true
that
the
decision
to
shove
the
clipper
not
the
same
thing
as
intergraphs
down
our
throats
violates
the
principles
of
what
the
us
was
founded
on
but
the
government
is
full
of
idiotic
robots
called
bureaucrats
and
theres
less
to
worry
about
than
one
might
think
only
really
innocent
read
naive
subjects
of
the
us
will
be
hurt
by
this
the
rest
of
us
criminals
will
live
in
secure
freedom
de
toqueville
pointed
out
years
ago
that
the
tyranny
of
the
majority
will
be
mitigated
by
the
mediocrity
of
the
government
and
given
what
i
see
government
officials
doing
where
i
work
argonne
national
lab
the
level
of
stupidity
makes
dave
s
look
smart
patience
persistence
