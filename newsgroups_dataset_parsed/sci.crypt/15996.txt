g
i
found
the
personal
attacks
on
prof
denning
pretty
disgusting
i
dont
agree
with
all
her
positions
but
i
think
scholars
can
disagree
without
the
argument
getting
into
the
gutter
if
these
personal
attacks
are
what
stopped
prof
denning
from
replying
on
issues
of
substance
they
have
cause
real
harm
to
the
serious
debate
