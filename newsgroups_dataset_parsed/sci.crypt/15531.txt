OH
I
SEE
YOUR
POINT
I
THINK
YOURE
WRONG
BUT
IF
YOU
SIT
BACK
AND
WAIT
TO
FIND
OUT
IF
IM
RIGHT
ITLL
BE
TOO
LATE
JUST
LISTEN
VERY
CAREFULLY
FOR
THE
FIRST
SUCH
AND
SUCH

IVE
BEEN
A
VERY
INTENT
NREN
SPECTATOR
OF
THE
NREN
FOR
YEARS
AS
A

SOFTWARE
VENDOR
IT
REALLY
IS
MY
PROFESSIONAL
OPINION
THAT
THE
NREN
AT
THIS
POINT
IS
IRRELEVANT
TO
PRIVATE
SECTOR
NETWORKING
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
DEPLOYED
FIVE
YEARS
AGO
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
MAJOR
DEVELOPMENT
NOW
HOWEVER
ITS
JUST
AN
UPGRADE
TO
THE
NSFNET
AND
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
REVIVE
THE
LAGGING
USE
OF

YOU
COULD
CUT
OUT

COMPLETELY

THE

WOULD
