the
old
key
registration
idea
okay
lets
suppose
that
the
nsanistmykotronix
registered
key
system
becomes
standard
and
im
able
to
buy
such
a
system
from
my
local
radio
shack
every
phone
comes
with
a
built
in
chip
and
the
government
has
the
key
to
every
phone
call
i
go
and
buy
a
phone
and
dutifully
register
the
key
whats
to
prevent
me
from
swapping
phones
with
a
friend
or
buying
a
used
phone
at
a
garage
sale
whooa
the
secret
registered
keys
just
became
unsynchronized
when
the
government
comes
to
listen
in
they
only
receive
gobbledlygook
because
the
secret
key
registered
under
my
name
isnt
the
right
one
that
leads
me
to
conjecture
that
the
system
isnt
that
secure
there
are
just
two
master
keys
that
work
for
all
the
phones
in
the
country
the
part
about
registering
your
keys
is
just
bogus
or
the
system
is
vulnerable
to
simple
phone
swapping
attacks
like
this
criminals
will
quickly
figure
this
out
and
go
to
town
in
either
case
i
think
we
need
to
look
at
this
a
bit
