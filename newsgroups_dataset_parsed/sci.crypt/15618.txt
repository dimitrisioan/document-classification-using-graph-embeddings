TOM
HORSLEY
WRITES
THIS
ISNT
INTENDED
TO
BE
A
FLAME
OR
ANYTHING
I
AM
JUST
REALLY
CURIOUS
HOW
TO
MANUFACTURE
THESE
THINGS
WHILE
STILL
MAINTAINING
THE
KEY
ESCROW
SECURITY
WITHOUT
SIMPLY
SAYING
TRUST
THE
MANUFACTURER
THEY
WONT
LOOK
WITHOUT
GETTING
INTO
THE
REALLY
THORNY
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
REVERSE
ENGINEERING
AND
ALL
OF
THAT
LET
ME
JUST
POINT
OUT
THAT
THERE
ALREADY
EXIST
GATE
ARRAYS
AND
SUCHLIKE
THAT
HAVE
WHATS
KNOWN
AS
A
SECURITY
FUSE
WHICH
CAN
BE
PROGRAMMED
AFTER
YOUVE
VERIFIED
ALL
OTHER
PROGRAMMING
THIS
MAKES
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
READ
OUT
THE
PROGRAMMING
OF
THE
DEVICE
AGAIN
IGNORING
THE
REVERSE
ENGINEERING
QUESTIONS
SPEAKING
FROM
EXPERIENCE
HERE
I
HAD
TO
COMPLETELY
REINVENT
ONE
OF
MY
DESIGNS
SOME
SIX
OR
SEVEN
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
THE
DISK
FILE
WAS
ZAPPED
THE
BACKUPS
WERE
ALL
BAD
AND
THE
DEVICES
WERE
UNREADABLE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SECURITY
FUSES
MADE
ME
APPRECIATE
THE
VALUE
OF
PRINTOUTS
SO
ON
THIS
POINT
AT
LEAST
THERES
NOT
SO
MUCH
WORRY
BUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
CAN
GET
THE
CHIPS
MADE
RELIABLY
AND
SECURELY
IS
REALLY
SECONDARY
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
USE
OF
THE
CHIP
IS
ITSELF
LIKELY
TO
BE
SECURE

ROBERT
BICKFORD
A
HACKER
IS
ANY
PERSON
WHO
DERIVES
JOY
FROM
RABWELLSFCAUS
DISCOVERING
WAYS
TO
CIRCUMVENT
LIMITATIONS
I
RECOGNIZE
THAT
A
CLASS
OF
CRIMINALS
AND
JUVENILE
DELINQUENTS
HAS
TAKEN
TO
CALLING
THEMSELVES
HACKERS
BUT
I
CONSIDER
THEM
IRRELEVANT
TO
THE
TRUE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORD
JUST
AS
THE
MAFIA
CALLS
THEMSELVES
BUSINESSMEN
BUT
NOBODY
PAYS
THAT
FACT
ANY
ATTENTION
