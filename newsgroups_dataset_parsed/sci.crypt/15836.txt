a
person
i
know
belonging
to
a
research
lab
of
a
rivate
company
claimed
to
me
during
a
priavte
conversation
that
given
the
equipment
in
his
lab
he
could
crack
a
kerberos
ticket
in
minutes
to
an
hour
he
had
access
to
rather
powerful
des
hardware
but
not
of
an
extraordinare
kind
i
believe
the
attack
was
possible
because
of
the
amount
of
known
plaintext
in
the
ticket
which
itself
constitutes
a
small
message
this
was
two
years
ago
that
would
be
a
ticket
presumably
not
a
ticket
the
ticket
format
can
even
be
complicated
