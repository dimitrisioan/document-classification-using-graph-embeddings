BRAD
YEARWOOD
WRITES
IF
CLIPPER
COMES
TO
CELLULAR
PHONES
ALONG
WITH
LEGAL
PROSCRIPTIONS
AGAINST
USING
OTHER
CIPHER
SYSTEMS
ON
THESE
PHONES
A
NEW
AND
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
CLASS
OF
CRIME
IS
CREATED
ASIDE
FROM
POSSESSION
OF
TERRORIST
TOOLS
UNAPPROVED
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
OR
PROGRAMS
CRIMINALS
WHO
VERY
BADLY
WANT
INSCRUTABLE
TACTICAL
COMMUNICATIONS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
TERRORISTS
AND
DRUG
DEALERS
WHO
PROPONENTS
OF
KEY
ESCROW
CITE
AS
THREATS
WILL
BE
HIGHLY
MOTIVATED
TO
STEAL
THE
CIPHER
PHONE
OF
A
LEGITIMATE
USER
AND
TO
KILL
THIS
PERSON
OR
HOLD
THEM
HOSTAGE
SO
DISCOVERY
OF
COMPROMISE
OF
THE
DEVICE
WILL
BE
DELAYED
ONCE
A
SUITABLE
COLLECTION
OF
DEVICES
IS
STOLEN
CRIMINALS
CAN
COMMUNICATE
WITH
IMPUNITY
ASSUMING
THE
CIPHER
SYSTEM
CARRIES
NO
TRAPDOORS
APART
FROM
KEY
ESCROW
UNTIL
AND
UNLESS
THE
COMPROMISE
IS
DISCOVERED
BY
SOME
OTHER
MEANS
BECAUSE
LIFEISCHEAP
CRIMINALS
ARE
CURRENTLY
WILLING
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
TO
STEAL
VERY
LARGE
AND
CONSPICUOUS
PROPERTY
LUXURY
CARS
IT
IS
REASONABLE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THEY
WILL
BE
WILLING
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
TO
STEAL
SMALL
AND
INCONSPICUOUS
PROPERTY
A
CIPHER
CELLULAR
PHONE
JUST
AS
WE
HAVE
SEEN
IN
THE
PAST
WITH
BLUE
BOX
TECHNOLOGY
AND
IN
THE
PRESENT
WITH
MODIFIED
CELLULAR
PHONES
WE
CAN
EXPECT
TO
SEE
AMONG
HIGHSTAKES
CRIMINALS
A
LUCRATIVE
MARKET
FOR
STOLEN
CIPHER
PHONES
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
THE
HIGHSTAKES
CRIMINALS
WILL
PAY
THE
LIFEISCHEAP
TYPES
SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNTS
FOR
STOLEN
INSTRUMENTS
BECAUSE
A
PERSON
IS
TYPICALLY
DISCOVERED
AS
MISSING
OR
DEAD
IN
A
FEW
DAYS
A
STOLEN
INSTRUMENT
WILL
BE
USABLE
FOR
ONLY
A
FEW
DAYS
THERE
WILL
BE
A
CONTINUING
DEMAND
FOR
FRESH
PHONES
FRESH
BODIES
AND
SINCE
CLINTON
IS
ALSO
GOING
FULLBORE
TO
DENY
UNCONNECTED
CITIZENS
THE
MEANS
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
WE
WILL
PROTECT
YOU
IS
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
YOU
BY
PERVERTING
OR
TRASHING
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
THE
TARGETED
INDIVIDUALS
WILL
BE
GUARANTEED
EASY
PREY
WHAT
IS
A
FEW
BODIES
COMPARED
TO
THE
GREATER
GOOD
OF
THE
FED
BEING
ABLE
TO
DEFEAT
A
CITIZENS
SECURITY
WITH
IMPUNITY
YOU
DONT
THINK
THERE
DOESNT
EXIST
A
MEANS
BY
WHICH
THE
NSA
CAN
DO
THEIR
USUAL
EAVESDROPPING
SCANNING
FOR
KEYWORDS
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
A
COURT
ORDER
OR
ANY
KEYS
DO
YOU
IF
SO
I
GOT
SOME
GREAT
FLORIDA
REAL
ESTATE
YOU
MIGHT
BE
INTERESTED
IN
PERHAPS
THE
IDEA
OF
ESCROWED
KEYS
IS
MEANT
TO
DIVERT
THE
DISCUSSION
TO
HOW
THEY
WILL
BE
SAFEGUARDED
AND
AWAY
FROM
THE
BASIC
FACT
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
SYSTEMATICALLY
TAKING
AWAY
OUR
RIGHT
TO
PRIVACY
TO
BE
SECURE
FOR
THE
MEANS
OF
SELFDEFENSE
AND
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
OTHER
RIGHT
SPELLED
OUT
IN
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
NAWWWW
THEY
ARE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TRUST
US
IN
OTHER
WORDS
CLIPPER
AND
SIMILAR
SYSTEMS
HAVE
THE
POTENTIAL
TO
TURN
A
CURRENT
INCONVENIENCE
TO
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
INTO
A
DIRECT
VICIOUS
AND
PERSISTENT
THREAT
TO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
WHAT
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
PEOPLE
CONTROL
OR
THE
SAFETY
OF
THE

PUBLIC
THE
GUN

ISSUE
SHOULD
ANSWER

HOW
GOOD

SAFER
THE

THAT
ARE
THE
WORST
IN
THAT

ARE
ALSO
THE

WITH

GOVERNMENT
IS
NOT

IT
IS
