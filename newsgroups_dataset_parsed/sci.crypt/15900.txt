RECENTLY
BEEN
READING
A
PAPER
OF
MERKLES
PUBLIXHED
ONLY
ON

I
THINK
DISCUSSING
THREE
POTENTIAL
REPLACEMENTS
FOR
DES
WAS
ANYTING
EVER
DONE
WITH
THESE
ARE
KHUFU
KHAFRE
ANDOR
SNEFRU
STILL
BEING
DISCUSSED
ANYWHERE
I
KNOW
SNEFRU
IS
REFERENCED
IN
THE
RSA
FAQ
AND
I
THINK
IT
MAY
ALSO
BE
IN
THE
SCICRYPT
FAQ
ON
A
RELATED

CAN
ANYONE

KHUFU
AND
KHAFRE
ARE
BOTH
PATENTED
BIHAM
AND
SHAMIR
SHOWED
THAT
DIFFERENTIAL
CRYPTANALYSIS
CAN
BREAK
KHAFRE
WITH
A
CHOSEN
PLAINTEXT
ATTACK
USING
DIFFERENT
ENCRYPTIONS
KHAFRE
WITH
ROUNDS
CAN
BE
BROKEN
WITH
THE
SAME
ATTACK
USING
DIFFERENT
ENCRYPTIONS
THERE
ARE
PROBABLY
MORE
EFFICIENT
DIFFERENTIAL
CRYPTANALYTIC
ATTACKS
IF
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
TAKE
THE

THE
