BRAD

WRITES
INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH
IN
DESIGNING
THE
ESCROW
WE
MAY
WANT
TO
USE
SOME
RATHER
UNUSUAL
TECHNOLOGY
SUCH
AS
SEALED
BOXES
OF
PAPER
OR
DESTRUCTIVE
READ
MEMORY
RATHER
THAN
TYPICAL
COMPUTER
DATABASES
WHICH
IS
FUN
FOR
A
DATABASE
OF
HUNDREDS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
KEYS
TO
ME
A
LARGER
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ONCE
DISCLOSED
YOUR
KEYS
COULD
BE
USED
TO
DECRYPT
ANY
PREVIOUSLY
RECORDED
CONVERSATIONS
I
GATHER
THAT
FROM
THIS
PROPOSAL
A
WARRANT
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
TO
GET
THE
KEYS
BUT
NOT
TO
COLLECT
CONVERSATIONS
CONSIDER
THE
SCENARIO
WHERE
AN
AGENCY
COLLECTS
PREEMPTIVELY
ALL
ENCRYPTED
CONVERSATIONS
FOR
CERTAIN
PEOPLE
LIKELY
TO
BE
TARGETS
AND
NOT
NECESSARILY
LEGITIMATE
TARGETS
THEN
ARRANGES
FOR
SOME
UNRELATED
INCIDENT
THAT
CAN
TRIGGER
A
WARRANT
YOUR
HONOR
WE
KNOW
THAT
THE
SUSPECT
HAS
RECEIVED
CALLS
FROM
NOTED
CRIME
FIGURE
BUGSY
BUTTHEAD
SAID
CALLS
ARRANGED
BY
THE
AGENCY
AND
WE
MUST
THEREFORE
HAVE
THIS
WARRANT
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
THIS
SUSPECT
IN
A
SENSITIVE
GOVT
POST
IS
CORRUPT
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
IT
IS
CONCEIVABLE
THAT
THERE
ARE
SESSION
KEYS
INVOLVED
SOMEWHERE
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
SEEM
LIKELY
IF
THERE
ARE
WHY
WOULDNT
THE
TECHNICAL
OVERVIEW
MENTION
THEM
WHEN
IT
GOES
TO
SUCH
DETAILS
AS
THE
NUMBER
OF
BITS
HELD
BY
EACH
ESCROW
AUTHORITY
THIS

IS
FULL
