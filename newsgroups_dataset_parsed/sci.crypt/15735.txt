RE
KEY
REGISTERING
BODIES
SINCE
THE
LAW
REQUIRES
THAT
WIRETAPS
BE
REQUESTED
BY
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
AND
APPROVED
BY
THE
JUDICIAL
BRANCH
IT
SEEMS
CLEAR
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
KEY
REGISTERING
BODIES
SHOULD
BE
UNDER
THE
CONTROL
OF
THE
JUDICIAL
BRANCH
I
SUGGEST
THE
SUPREME
COURT
OR
REGIONALLY
THE
COURTS
OF
APPEAL
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
THE
OFFICES
OF
THEIR
CLERKS
COURTS
ALREADY
OPERATE
SUBSTANTIAL
RECORDKEEPING
OPERATIONS
SOME
OF
THESE
RECORDS
ARE
CONFIDENTIAL
SO
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
COURT
HOLDING
INFORMATION
IN
CONFIDENCE
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
LAW
HAS
LONGSTANDING
LEGAL
PRECEDENTS
THE
JUDICIARY
IS
MORE
IMMUNE
TO
PRESSURE
FROM
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
THAN
ANY
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
AGENCY
OR
CONTRACTOR
CAN
BE
SO
JUDICIAL
CONTROL
OF
KEYS
IS
APPROPRIATE
FOR
THE
OTHER
HALF
OF
THE
KEY
I
SUGGEST
A
UNIT
OF
CONGRESS
THE
GENERAL
ACCOUNTING
OFFICE
THE
GAO
IS
CONGRESSS
STAFF
UNIT
FOR
KEEPING
TABS
ON
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
AND
HAS
AN
EXCELLENT
REPUTATION
ITS
CONTROLLED
STRICTLY
BY
CONGRESS
THE
EXECUTIVE
BRANCH
HAS
NO
AUTHORITY
OVER
IT
WITH
KEYS
SPLIT
BETWEEN
THE
LEGISLATIVE
AND
JUDICIAL
BRANCHES
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
A
CHANCE
OF
THIS
SYSTEM
WORKING
HONESTLY
IF
OF
COURSE
A
WAY
CAN
BE
FOUND
TO
KEEP
THE
KEYS
FROM
BEING
SIPHONED
OFF
BEFORE
THEY
REACH
THE
REPOSITORIES
THIS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
CONSTRUED
AS
AN
ENDORSEMENT
BY
ME
OF
THE
WHOLE
CLIPPER
CONCEPT
BUT
IF
WE
HAVE
TO
HAVE
IT
SPLITTING
CONTROL
ACROSS
ALL
THREE
BRANCHES
OF
GOVERNMENT
MIGHT
MAKE
IT
WORK
