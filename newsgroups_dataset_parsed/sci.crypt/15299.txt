IN

TCMAYNETCOMCOM
TIMOTHY
C
MAY
WRITES
BUT
IS
IT
ANY
WORSE
THAN
THE
CURRENT
UNSECURE
SYSTEM
IT
BECOMES
MUCH
WORSE
OF
COURSE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
THEN
USES
THIS
CLINTON
CLIPPER
TO
ARGUE
FOR
RESTRICTIONS
ON
UNAPPROVED
ENCRYPTION
THIS
IS
THE
MAIN
CONCERN
OF
MOST
OF
US
I
THINK
THE
CAMELS
NOSE
IN
THE
TENT
ETC
NOT
TO
PICK
ON
MR
MAY
IN
PARTICULAR
OF
COURSE
BUT
ISNT
THIS
KIND
OF
THE
DOMINO
THEORY
WHEN
ONE
LITTLE
COUNTRY
FALLS
ITS
NEIGHBOR
WILL
SURELY
FOLLOW
AND
BEFORE
YOU
KNOW
IT
WERE
ALL
MINING
SALT
IN
SIBERIA
FOR
NOT
TURNING
IN
OUR
CAPTAIN
CRUNCH
SECRET
DECODER
RINGS
I
WISH
I
COULD
AGREE
WITH
YOU
ASK
YOURSELF
THIS
WHY
WOULD
ANY
PRIVATE
SECTOR
ENTITY
WISH
TO
BUY
A
CRYPTO
SYSTEM
THAT
WAS
KNOWN
TO
BE
AT
LEAST
PARTIALLY
COMPROMISED
KEY
ESCROWS
IN
THIS
INSTANCE
WHY
WOULD
ANY
PRIVATE
SECTOR
ENTITY
WISH
TO
BUY
A
CRYPTO
SYSTEM
THAT
HAD
NOT
BEEN
PROPERLY
EVALUATED
IE
ALGORYTHM
NOT
PUBLICALLY
RELEASED
THE
ANSWER
SEEMS
OBVIOUS
TO
ME
THEY
WOULDNT
THERE
IS
OTHER
HARDWARE
OUT
THERE
NOT
COMPROMISED
DES
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
TRIPLE
DES
AS
A
BETTER
ONE
MY
SUSPICION
IS
THAT
THE
PRICES
WILL
DROP
DRAMATICALLY
ON
THESE
NON
CLIPPER
SYSTEMS
IF
NOT
WERE
IN
TROUBLE
GIVEN
THAT
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
STUPID
ALTHOUGH
WED
LIKE
TO
THINK
SO
I
CANNOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
FAILED
TO
REALIZE
THIS
THEY
KNOW
THEIR
INITIATIVE
WILL
FAIL
MUCH
AS
CRIPPLED
DES
WAS
NEVER
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
THE
ONLY
WAY
THEIR
MOVES
CAN
WORK
IS
BY
COERCION
YOU
KNOW
LITTLE
ABOUT
POLITICS
IF
YOU
DONT
REALIZE
THAT
THIS
IS
JUST
A
FIRST
STEP
IN
THE
NEXT
MOVE
IT
MAKES
NO
SENSE
OTHERWISE
THE
NEXT
MOVE
BANNING
OR
SEVERLY
CRIPPLING
CRYPTO
NOT
USING
THE
CLIPPER
SYSTEM
IS
EASILY
JUSTIFIED
WHY
WOULD
ANYONE
WANT
OTHER
ENCRYPTION
UNLESS
THEY
WERE
TRYING
TO
SUBVERT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WEVE
PROVIDED
YOU
WITH
A
VERY
SECURE
ALTERNATIVE
SO
USE
IT
OR
GO
TO
JAILBE
FINEDWHATEVER
HOW
CAN
YOU
RECONCILE
THE
ADMINISTRATIONS
SELF
PROCLAIMED
PURPOSE
OF
PROVIDING
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
WITH
ACCESS
TO
ENCRYPTED
DATA
WITHOUT
MAKING
THE
CLIPPER
SYSTEM
THE
ONLY
CRYPTO
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
US
YOU
SIMPLY
CANT
AND
THE
ADMINISTRATION
KNOWS
IT
ANYONE
WHO
WANTED
TO
KEEP
THE
GOVT
OUT
OF
THEIR
HAIR
BE
IT
FOR
DRUG
DEALING
OR
WHATEVER
WOULD
JUST
BUY
STILL
AVAILABLE
NONCLIPPER
SYSTEMS
DONT
SELL
OUR
CRAFTY
CLINTON
TYPES
SHORT
THEY
CANT
BE
THAT
STUPID
EITHER
BANNING
NON
CLIPPER
CRYPTO
IS
THE
NEXT
ANSWER
OR
THE
ADMINISTRATIONS
COLLECTIVE
IQ
IS
ABOUT
THAT
OF
A
POTATO
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
ATT
JUMPED
ON
SO
FAST
THEY
KNOW
ITS
GOING
TO
BE
BIG
AND
NOT
BECAUSE
ITS
BETTER
RIGHT
ON
THE
FACE
OF
IT
NOONE
WILL
BUY
THE
STUFF
THAT
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
ATT
MUST
KNOW
THIS
TOO
THINK
MAN
WHY
THE
HELL
WOULD
THEY
JUMP
THE
GUN
MY
INTERPRETATION
ANDREW
TIM
MAY
WHOSE
SIG
BLOCK
MAY
GET
HIM
BUSTED
IN
THE
NEW
REGIME
ISNT
THIS
JUST
A
LITTLE
MELODRAMATIC
I
REALLY
WONDER
TO
WIT
THE
LETTER
I
JUST
SENT
TO
CLINTON
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
OFFICE
OF
THE
PRESS
SECRETARY
CO
PRESIDENTIAL
COMMENT
LINE
FAX
APRIL
SIR
ANDOR
MADAM
I
MUST
OBJECT
MOST
STRONGLY
TO
THE
ADMINISTRATIONS
EVOLVING
POSITION
ON
ENCRYPTION
AND
CRYPTOGRAPHY
I
AM
SHOCKED
AT
THE
CLINTON
REGIMES
INCREASING
LEAN
TOWARDS
A
AUTHORITARIAN
APPROACH
WITH
REGARD
TO
PRIVACY
AND
FREEDOM
FROM
GOVERNMENT
OVERSIGHT
IN
DAY
TO
DAY
LIFE
IT
IS
APPARENT
TO
ME
THAT
THOSE
WHO
DRAFTED
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
PROPOSAL
WHICH
IS
INCIDENTALLY
GAINING
NOTORIETY
AS
THE
BIG
BROTHER
PROPOSAL
ARE
EITHER
INCREDIBLY
IGNORANT
OR
VERY
SLY
INDEED
ANYONE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
IN
THE
NUANCES
OF
CRYPTOGRAPHIC
DEVELOPMENT
AND
RESEARCH
MUST
UNDERSTAND
THAT
A
KEY
STEP
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
NEW
ALGORITHM
ESPECIALLY
ONE
DESTINED
FOR
STANDARDIZATION
IS
THE
FULL
DISCLOSURE
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
TO
THE
PRIVATE
AND
ACADEMIC
SECTORS
THE
PROPER
EVALUATION
OF
AN
ALGORITHM
DEP
ENDS
ON
CAREFUL
SCRUTINY
BY
THESE
SECTORS
AND
ONLY
SUCH
SCRUTINY
CAN
PROVIDE
TRUE
PUBLIC
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
ALGORITHM
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
A
NEW
ALGORITHM
WILL
BE
ACCEPTED
BASED
ON
ASSURANCES
FROM
EXPERTS
WITHOUT
FULL
DISCLOSURE
IS
PLAIN
IGNORANCE
IN
ADDITION
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
AN
ALGORITHM
WILL
BE
MARKETABLE
OVER
OTHER
TECHNOLOGY
SUCH
AS
DES
WHEN
IT
IS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
KEY
ESCROW
IS
LUNACY
IT
SEEMS
AN
EASY
STEP
IN
THE
LOGIC
CHAIN
THAT
PROBABLE
CONSUMERS
WILL
PREFER
TO
PURCHASE
EQUIPMENT
NOT
CRIPPLED
BY
GOVERNMENT
KEY
ESCROW
NO
MATTER
HOW
TAMPER
PROOF
THE
KEY
ESCROWS
MIGHT
BE
I
CANNOT
BELIEVE
THAT
EVEN
THE
LEAST
EDUCATED
POLICY
MAKER
WOULD
HAVE
FAILED
TO
REALIZE
THESE
FLAWS
I
CAN
ONLY
ASSUME
THEN
THAT
THE
DRAFTERS
OF
THE
CLIPPER
CHIP
PROPOSAL
KNEW
VERY
WELL
THE
DIFFICULTIES
OF
SELLING
A
CRIPPLED
SYSTEM
TO
THE
PRIVATE
SECTOR
THE
ONLY
WAY
THIS
PROPOSAL
MAKES
ANY
SENSE
OR
HAS
ANY
CHANCE
OF
SUCCEEDING
IS
IN
COERCION
EVEN
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
THE
PROPOSAL
MAKES
IT
PAINFULLY
CLEAR
THAT
THE
NEXT
LOGICAL
STEP
IS
THE
OUTLAWING
OF
OTHER
ENCRYPTION
DEVICES
AND
HARDWARE
THAT
DO
NOT
UTI
LIZE
THE
BIG
BROTHER
CHIP
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
PUBLIC
AT
LARGE
IS
NOT
EDUCATED
ENOUGH
ON
THE
ISSUE
TO
REALIZE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
LOSING
I
EXPECT
THE
BIG
BROTHER
PROPOSAL
TO
ENCOUNTER
LITTLE
RESISTANCE
FROM
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
WHO
YOU
WILL
HAVE
SO
EFFICIENTLY
DUPED
ONCE
AGAIN
WITH
PRETTY
WORDS
LIKE
HARMONY
RIGHT
TO
ENCRYPTION
AND
VOLUNTARY
IT
MORTIFIES
ME
THAT
THE
PHRASE
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
USED
MORE
AND
MORE
OFTEN
TO
CHARACTERIZE
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
IS
I
CANT
BELIEVE
ITS
HAPPENING
HERE
MORE
STARTLING
IS
A
QUESTION
A
COLLEAGUE
OF
MINE
POSED
AND
THE
REALIZATION
THAT
EVERYDAY
IT
BECOMES
MORE
