RE

LOBBYING
FOR
CRYPTOGRAPHY
GENERALLY
AN
ORGANIZATION
HAS
INFLUENCE
IN
PROPORTION
TO
THE
NARROWNESS
OF
ITS
OBJECTIVES
THE
NUMBER
OF
MEMBERS
THE
STRENGTH
OF
BELIEF
OF
ITS
MEMBERS
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
PRO
AND
ANTIABORTION
GROUPS
ARE
SO
STRONG
NARROW
OBJECTIVES
LOTS
OF
INTERESTED
MEMBERS
WHO
ARE
REAL
PASSIONATE
FOR
THIS
REASON
MIXING
WITH
THE
NRA
IS
PROBABLY
A
BAD
IDEA
IT
DIFFUSES
THE
INTERESTS
OF
BOTH
GROUPS
IT
MAY
WELL
DIMINISH
THE
PASSION
INDEX
OF
THE
COMBINED
ORGANIZATION
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
IT
WOULD
GREATLY
ENLARGE
THE
NRA
SO
I
BELIEVE
A
NEW
ORGANIZATION
WHICH
MAY
COOPERATE
WITH
NRA
WHERE
THE
TWO
ORGANIZATIONS
INTEREST
COINCIDE
IS
THE
OPTIMUM
STRATEGY
