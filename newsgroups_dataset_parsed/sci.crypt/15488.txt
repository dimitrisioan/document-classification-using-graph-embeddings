can
you
while
my
mind
is
on
it
give
us
one
good
reason
that
the
algorithm
should
be
a
secret
algorithm
unless
this
encryption
scheme
either
is
a
joke
or
contains
features
like
a
master
key
or
other
back
door
for
unauthorized
eavesdropping
hmm
here
are
a
couple
if
the
algorithm
becomes
known
it
will
be
easy
to
produce
pincompatible
noncrippled
chips
that
provide
real
encryption
and
privacy
because
their
keys
are
only
in
their
users
hands
since
skipjack
is
a
symmetric
key
cypher
it
needs
some
way
to
agree
on
a
session
key
the
released
information
says
that
any
protocol
may
be
used
eg
dh
from
a
theoretical
point
of
view
this
is
probably
true
however
from
a
practical
point
of
view
those
chips
must
have
some
kind
of
key
exchange
protocol
builtin
what
if
it
is
good
old
rsa
this
will
mean
that
the
producer
will
have
to
pay
lots
of
bucks
to
pkp
by
keeping
the
details
secret
this
can
be
avoided
