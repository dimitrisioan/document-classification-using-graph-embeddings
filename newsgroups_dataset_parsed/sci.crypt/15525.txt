ANOTHER
KEY
REGISTRATION
BODY
BITES
THE
DUST
IMHO
ONE
OF
THE
CANDIDATES
THAT
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
FOR
A
KEY
REGISTRATION
BODY
IS
THE
ACLU
I
THINK
THIS
IS
POOR
CHOICE
THE
ACLU
IS
ESSENTIALLY
A
GROUP
OF
AUDITORS
THEY
AUDIT
HOW
PEOPLES
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
ARE
ADMINISTERED
TRADITIONALLY
AUDITORS
DO
NOT
LIKE
TO
GET
INVOLVED
IN
THE
DESIGN
OR
OPERATIONAL
ASPECTS
OF
THINGS
AND
WITH
GOOD
REASON
WHEN
I
WAS
A
SYSTEMS
PROGRAMMER
IT
ALWAYS
INFURIATED
ME
THAT
THE
AUDITORS
WOULD
COME
IN
AND
TELL
US
OUR
IMPLEMENTATION
STUNK
FROM
A
SECURITY
POINT
OF
VIEW
BUT
WOULDNT
TELL
US
HOW
TO
FIX
IT
I
ALWAYS
FIGURED
THEY
JUST
LIKED
TO
CRITCIZE
WITHOUT
DOING
THE
WORK
TO
HELP
FIX
THE
PROBLEM
THEN
I
TOOK
A
STINT
AS
AN
AUDITOR
AND
I
FOUND
OUT
THE
REAL
REASON
AUDITORS
DONT
LIKE
TO
RECOMMEND
SOLUTIONS
BECAUSE
IT
PUTS
THEM
IN
A
BAD
POSITION
IF
THEY
HAVE
TO
CRITICIZE
THE
IMPLEMENTATION
LATER
THE
AUDITEE
CAN
SAY
WELL
YOU
TOLD
US
THIS
WAY
WOULD
BE
OK
IT
COMPROMISES
THE
INDEPENDENCE
THAT
IS
A
NECESSARY
PART
OF
THE
AUDITORS
JOB
TAKING
THE
CASE
AT
HAND
SUPPOSE
ACLU
BECOMES
A
KEY
HALF
REGISTRAR
SUPPOSE
THAT
PERHAPS
THROUGH
SOME
ERROR
ON
ACLUS
PART
A
KEY
HALF
GETS
AWAY
THAT
SHOULDNT
AND
IS
USED
TO
DEPRIVE
SOMEONE
OF
HER
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
THE
ACLU
GETS
WIND
OF
THIS
AND
WANTS
TO
TAKE
IT
TO
COURT
BUT
THEY
END
UP
BEING
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
DEFENDANT
AND
OF
THE
PLAINTIFF
WHICH
IS
NOT
AN
EASY
POSITION
TO
BE
IN
THERE
ARE
EXCEPTIONS
TO
THE
COMPLETE
INDEPENDENCE
OF
AUDITORS
AT
ONE
PLACE
WHERE
I
WORKED
WHEN
PAYROLL
CHECKS
WERE
PRINTED
THEY
WERE
SIGNED
AUTOMATICALLY
BY
A
SIGNATURE
DRUM
ON
THE
BURSTING
MACHINE
THIS
DRUM
WAS
KEPT
BY
THE
AUDITORS
WHO
ALSO
KEPT
THE
CHECK
STOCK
AND
WAS
BROUGHT
DOWN
TO
DATA
PROCESSING
WHEN
IT
WAS
TIME
TO
DO
THE
CHECKS
I
BELIEVE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THIS
SITUATION
AND
THE
KEY
REGISTRATION
SITUATION
IS
THAT
IT
IS
FAIRLY
OBVIOUS
WHEN
IT
IS
TIME
TO
DO
THE
PAYROLL
CHECKS
IF
THEY
WERE
DONE
YESTERDAY
AND
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
DO
THEM
AGAIN
TODAY
HE
BETTER
BE
ABLE
TO
PRODUCE
YESTERDAYS
CHECKS
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
BE
DESTROYED
DETERMINING
WHICH
OF
THE
MANY
REQUESTS
FOR
KEY
HALVES
ARE
LEGIT
IS
A
TRICKIER
PROCESS
ONE
MUCH
MORE
PRONE
TO
MISTAKES
THAT
COULD
PUT
THE
ACLU
IN
A
PROTECTINGTHECLIENT
VERSUS
PROTECTINGTHEACLU
CONFLICT
OF
INTEREST
AS
ALWAYS
MY
OPINIONS
ARE
