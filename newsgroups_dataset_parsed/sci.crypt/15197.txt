THE

SOLUTION
FOR
RUBICKS
CUBE
FROM
A
RANDOMLY
CHOSEN
POSITION
I
HAVE
READ
THE
FAQ
AND
FOLLOWED
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
ON
RUBICKS
CUBE
BUT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THIS
QUESTION
HAS
BEEN
ANSWERED
NOTICE
THAT
I
AM
SPECIFICALLY
LOOKING
FOR
AN
ALGORITHM
THAT
FINDS
THE
SHORTEST
PATH
NOT
JUST
ANY
SOLUTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
UNDERLYING
ASSUMPTION
IS
THAT
SUCH
A
PROGRAM
WOULD
NEED
TO
DO
A
BRUTE
FORCE
SEARCH
THOUGH
POSITIONS
THAT
SEEMS
AN
UNREASONABLY
PESSIMISTIC
ASSUMPTION
TO
ME
AND
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
IF
SOMEONE
HAS
SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPROVED
ON
THAT
I
HAVE
SOME
IDEAS
OF
MY
OWN
ON
HOW
TO
APPROACH
THIS
PROBLEM
BUT
BEFORE
I
SPEND
TO
MUCH
TIME
DEVELOPING
THEM
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
IF
SOMEONE
ELSE
HAS
ALREADY
DONE
THE
WORK
ADMINISTRIVIA
I
HAVE
POSTED
THIS
TO
THREE
GROUPS
AND
ATTEMPTED
TO
SET
THE
FOLLOWUP
TO
RECPUZZLES
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
THE
PLACE
TO
CONTINUE
THIS
DISCUSSION
I
WILL
CROSS
POST
A
SUMMARY

AND
IF
IT
BECOMES
APPROPRIATE
