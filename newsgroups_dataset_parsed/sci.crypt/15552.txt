the
copsfeds
do
not
need
to
be
able
to
get
hold
of
your
private
key
to
listen
in
to
cellular
conversations
encryption
is
not
endtoend
but
cellphone
to
basestation
that
was
true
for
the
uk
paul
but
im
fairly
sure
theyre
talking
about
building
endtoend
encryption
phones
out
of
this
chip
its
not
for
cellular
though
it
certainly
could
be
used
there
in
the
way
you
suggest
id
lost
the
white
houses
deathless
prose
when
i
posted
thats
what
happens
when
you
read
news
at
home
when
youre
ratarsed
but
i
did
have
a
bunch
of
followups
going
on
about
cellularcordless
comms
the
original
article
has
reappeared
so
the
president
today
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
the
federal
government
together
with
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
improve
the
security
and
privacy
of
telephone
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
hmm
telephone
communications
could
indeed
include
endtoend
encryption
on
ordinary
landlines
the
initiative
will
involve
the
creation
of
new
products
to
accelerate
the
development
and
use
of
advanced
and
secure
telecommunications
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
but
the
next
paragraph
says
telecoms
networks
and
wireless
communications
links
ok
its
far
from
clear
exactly
what
cripple
what
an
apposite
anagram
will
be
applied
to
but
the
reason
joe
public
wants
secure
comms
is
to
stop
people
listening
in
to
his
cellular
or
cordless
phones
and
he
wouldnt
even
be
bothered
about
that
were
it
not
for
wingnut
and
squidqys
misfortunes
yes
cripple
might
be
for
endtoend
encyption
dropping
to
clear
when
the
other
end
doesnt
have
cripple
but
then
a
cordlesstoordinary
conversation
would
be
in
clear
leaving
the
cordless
end
just
as
vulnerable
as
at
present
nope
i
suspect
that
cripple
will
only
be
used
on
radio
links
ok
its
possible
telecommunications
networks
could
mean
ordinary
phone
lines
but
im
betting
it
means
the
microwave
links
used
by
the
telcos
my
apologies
if
im
wrong
particularly
if
the
turgid
press
release
makes
it
clear
that
im
wrong
and
i
missed
it
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
was
full
of
obfuscation
and
anyone
expecting
endtoend
encryption
is
in
for
a
surprise
imho
btw
graham
ive
posted
questions
to

not
seen

from

how
about
you
have
i

there
