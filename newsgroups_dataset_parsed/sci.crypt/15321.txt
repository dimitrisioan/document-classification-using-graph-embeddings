WROTE
BEFORE
WE
CAN
HAVE
A
GLOBAL
MULTIMEDIA
EMAIL
SOLUTION
THERE
MUST
BE
SOME
DEFINITION
OF
A
MINIMUM
SERVICE
LEVEL
AND
MIME
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
FOR
THIS
YET
BEFORE
THE
INTERNET
WILL
INVEST
IN
SOFTWARE
PEOPLE
NEED
TO
SEE
CONTENT
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
ATTRACTIVE
MIME
FORMATTED
NEWS
MESSAGES
A
DAY
WOULD
BE
SUFFICIENT
TO
GET
A
FEW
PEOPLE
THINKING
ABOUT
ADDING
MIME
SUPPORT
TO
NEWS
READERS
ESP
IF
THE
CONTENT
IS
REALLY
WORTH
IT
IMHO
WE
HAVE
A
LONG
WAY
TO
GO
BEFORE
THE
UNIXSPECIFIC
MUAS
NEWSREADERS
ETC
REACH
THE
SERVICE
LEVELS
OF
THE
OTHER
COMMERCIAL
PLATFORMS
THERE
OUGHT
TO
BE
SUCH
A
DEFINITION
CONSISTING
OF
KNOWN
OBJECT
DATA
TYPES
AND
RULES
FOR
THEIR
HANDLING
INCLUDED
IN
THE
TRANSPORT
SPECIFICATION
DOCUMENT
YES
BUT
THERE
IS
ALSO
A
LONG
WAY
TO
GO
BEFORE
MOST
MAC
PC
AND
WINDOWS
MUAS
AND
NEWSREADERS
ARE
READY
TO
HANDLE
THE
SHEER
VOLUME
OF
NEWS
AND
MAIL
THAT
MANY
UNIX
SPECIFIC
TOOLS
ARE
ABLE
TO
COPE
WITH
WHEN
THE
CHOICE
IS
MORE
FEECHURS
OR
MAKE
THE
DAMN
THING
FAST
ENOUGH
TO
KEEP
UP
WITH
THE
FLOOD
YOU
HAVE
TO
BET
THAT
FAST
ENOUGH
WINS
ED
AS
USUAL
MAKES
A
VERY
GOOD
POINT
ONE
TIME
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
AT
SUN
SENT
ME
AN
EMAIL
HE
COMPOSED
IT
USING
THE
SUN
OPENWINDOWS
MAILTOOL
WHICH
HANDLES
NONMIME
ATTACHMENTS
AND
THE
LIKE
SINCE
I
DONT
USE
MAILTOOL
I
HAD
TO
MANUALLY
SAVE
IT
CUT
PASTE
AND
THEN
UUDECODE
THE
ACTUAL
ATTACHMENT
WHAT
I
GOT
AFTER
A
NOTINCONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
SPENT
DOING
THIS
WAS
AN
AUDIO
FILE
THE
ORIGINAL
MESSAGE
WAS
OVER
OF
MAIL
HEADERS
AND
UUENCODED
DATA
THE
RESULTING
AUDIO
MESSAGE
WAS
A
SINGLE
SENTENCE
THAT
I
TRANSCRIBED
AS
A
CHARACTER
MESSAGE
IF
HE
HAD
SENT
ME
THE
SENTENCE
IN
PLAIN
TEXT
THE
EMAIL
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
AROUND
BYTES
AND
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
ME
ABOUT
SECONDS
TO
PROCESS
IT
AT
MOST
INSTEAD
IT
WAS
AND
IT
TOOK
AT
LEAST
A
MINUTE
A
COMPLETE
WASTE
OF
MY
TIME
AND
BANDWIDTH
AS
FAR
AS
IM
CONCERNED
SENDING
PLAIN
TEXT
IS
STILL
THE
MOST
EFFICIENT
METHOD
OF
TRANSMISSION
GIVEN
THE
SAME
TRANSPORT
MECHANISM
I
SHUDDER
TO
THINK
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
EVERYONE
STARTED
POSTING
THEIR
USENET
ARTICLES
AS
AUDIO
FILES
INSTEAD
OF
PLAIN
