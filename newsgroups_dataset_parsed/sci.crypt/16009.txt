considered
harmful
restated
and
amplified
clipper
also
allows
an
extraordinary
opportunity
for
the
criminal
to
conceal
use
of
superencryption
an
automated
fullsystem
surveillance
mechanism
quite
feasible
across
radio
bandwidth
which
knows
family
key
f
can
validate
clipper
wrappers
and
nesn
associations
but
it
cannot
reveal
in
realtime
the
use
of
superencryption
unless
it
knows
all
unit
keys
which
we
are
being
assured
are
only
to
be
made
available
in
two
separate
pieces
upon
specific
wiretaplike
order
the
serial
number
will
be
in
a

block
with
a

filler
doesnt
take
a
