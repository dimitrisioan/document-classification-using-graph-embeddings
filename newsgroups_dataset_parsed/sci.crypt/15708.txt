des
init
vector
as
additional
key
the
recent
discussion
in
this
news
group
suggests
that
a
key
search
attack
against
des
is
quite
feasible
now
but
normally
des
is
applied
in
cbc
or
cfb
mode
where
one
chooses
a
random
init
vector
of
bytes
questions
makes
it
sense
to
handle
the
init
vector
as
an
additional
key
then
we
have
a
bit
key
if
yes
is
anything
known
about
the
security
of
this
key
scheme
can
we
break
it
faster
than
by
exhaustive
search
through
the
bit
key
space
