basic
crypto
requirements
in
order
to
have
formulate
a
rational
position
on
what
cryptography
policies
are
acceptable
we
must
set
forth
a
list
of
basic
requirements
i
would
propose
the
following
as
a
starting
point
the
algorithm
must
be
publicly
known
and
must
have
a
record
of
surviving
attempts
by
outside
experts
to
find
weaknesses
the
system
implementation
must
make
it
possible
to
verify
that
the
advertised
algorithm
is
in
fact
the
one
that
is
being
used
the
key
must
be
quickly
changeable
by
the
user
and
must
be
of
a
sufficient
length
and
complexity
to
defeat
any
bruteforce
search
possible
now
or
in
the
reasonably
near
future
note
that
these
requirements
are
not
incompatible
with
some
form
of
key
escrow
system
the
may
issue
of
byte
describes
an
example
of
an
encryption
system
which
can
clearly
be
implemented
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
above
requirements
while
requiring
that
parts
of
the
key
be
escrowed
in
order
to
have
ones
public
key
listed
by
a
central
distributor
