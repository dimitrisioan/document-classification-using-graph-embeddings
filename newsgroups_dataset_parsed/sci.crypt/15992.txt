really
like
to
see
such
a
thing
developed
so
that
interactive
internet
talk
radio
could
be
done
ideally
though
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
device
it
should
be
a
general
purpose
enough
device
that
nobody
should
be
able
to
balk
at
its
widespread
use
obviously
to
make
it
easy
for
homebrewers
it
should
use
pretty
common
hardware
i
suggest
we
start
with
the
ubiquitous
sun
to
get
a
lot
of
momentum
going
custom
hardware
isnt
going
to
go
anywhere
until
theres
a
user
base
why
dont
we
move
down
even
further
toward
the
masses
by
setting
this
up
on
an
ibm
pc
cloneprobably
needs
to
be
a
or
a
with
a
sound
blaster
and
a
modem
those
components
are
very
widely
available
i
dont
know
if
the
pc
has
enough
horsepower
to
encrypt
the
data
at
realtime
but
the
sound
blaster
has
to
hardware
compression
and
will
work
at
any
sampling
rate
