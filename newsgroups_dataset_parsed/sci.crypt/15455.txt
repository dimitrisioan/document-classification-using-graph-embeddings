SINCE
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
SPECULATION
ON
THIS

ABOUT
MY
OWN
INVOLVEMENT
IN
THIS
PROJECT
ID
LIKE
TO
ADD
THAT
I
WAS
NOT
IN
ANY
WAY
INVOLVED
I
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
IT
WHEN
THE
FBI
BRIEFED
ME
ON
THURSDAY
EVENING
APRIL
SINCE
THEN
I
HAVE
SPENT
CONSIDERABLE
TIME
TALKING
WITH
THE
NSA
AND
FBI
TO
LEARN
MORE
ABOUT
THIS
AND
I
ATTENDED
THE
NIST

INTRODUCTION
ON

THE

ANNOUNCED
A
NEW
INITIATIVE
THAT
WILL
BRING
TOGETHER
THE

IN
A
VOLUNTARY
PROGRAM
TO
PROVIDE
SECURE
COMMUNICATIONS
WHILE
MEETING
THE
LEGITIMATE
NEEDS
OF

AT
THE
HEART
OF
THE
PLAN
IS
A
NEW
TAMPERPROOF

A
