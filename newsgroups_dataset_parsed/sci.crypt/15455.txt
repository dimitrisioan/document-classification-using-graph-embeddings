the
clipper
chip
a
technical
summary
the
following
document
summarizes
the
clipper
chip
how
it
is
used
how
programming
of
the
chip
is
coupled
to
key
generation
and
the
escrow
process
and
how
law
enforcement
decrypts
communications
since
there
has
been
some
speculation
on
this
news
group
about
my
own
involvement
in
this
project
id
like
to
add
that
i
was
not
in
any
way
involved
i
found
out
about
it
when
the
fbi
briefed
me
on
thursday
evening
april
since
then
i
have
spent
considerable
time
talking
with
the
nsa
and
fbi
to
learn
more
about
this
and
i
attended
the
nist
briefing
at
the
department
of
commerce
on
april
the
document
below
is
the
result
of
that
effort

introduction
on
april
the
president
announced
a
new
initiative
that
will
bring
together
the
federal
government
and
industry
in
a
voluntary
program
to
provide
secure
communications
while
meeting
the
legitimate
needs
of
law
enforcement
at
the
heart
of
the
plan
is
a
new
tamperproof
encryption
chip
called
the
clipper
chip
together
with
a
splitkey
approach
to
escrowing
keys
two
escrow
agencies
are
used
and
the
key
parts
from
both
are
needed
to
reconstruct
a
key
chip
structure
the
clipper
chip
contains
a
classified
block
encryption
algorithm
called
skipjack
the
algorithm
uses
bit
keys
compared
with
for
the
des
and
has
rounds
of
scrambling
compared
with
for
the
des
it
supports
all
des
modes
of
operation
throughput
is
mbits
a
second
each
chip
includes
the
following
components
the
skipjack
encryption
algorithm
f
an
family
key
that
is
common
to
all
chips
n
a
serial
number
u
an
secret
key
that
unlocks
all
messages
encrypted
with
the
chip
encrypting
with
the
chip
to
see
how
the
chip
is
used
imagine
that
it
is
embedded
in
the
att
telephone
security
device
as
it
will
be
suppose
i
call
someone
and
we
both
have
such
a
device
after
pushing
a
button
to
start
a
secure
conversation
my
security
device
will
negotiate
a
session
key
k
with
the
device
at
the
other
end
in
general
any
method
of
key
exchange
can
be
used
the
key
k
and
message
stream
m
ie
digitized
voice
are
then
fed
into
the
clipper
chip
to
produce
two
values
em
k
the
encrypted
message
stream
and
eek
u
n
f
a
law
enforcement
block
the
law
enforcement
block
thus
contains
the
session
key
k
encrypted
under
the
unit
key
u
concatenated
with
the
serial
number
n
all
encrypted
under
the
family
key
f
chip
programming
and
escrow
all
clipper
chips
are
programmed
inside
a
scif
secure
computer
information
facility
which
is
essentially
a
vault
the
scif
contains
a
laptop
computer
and
equipment
to
program
the
chips
about
chips
are
programmed
during
a
single
session
the
scif
is
located
at
mikotronx
at
the
beginning
of
a
session
a
trusted
agent
from
each
of
the
two
key
escrow
agencies
enters
the
vault
agent
enters
an
value
into
the
laptop
and
agent
enters
an
value
these
values
serve
as
seeds
to
generate
keys
for
a
sequence
of
serial
numbers
to
generate
the
unit
key
for
a
serial
number
n
the
value
n
is
first
padded
with
a
fixed
block
to
produce
a
block
and
are
then
used
as
keys
to
tripleencrypt
producing
a
block
similarly
n
is
padded
with
two
other
blocks
to
produce
and
and
two
additional
blocks
and
are
computed
and
are
then
concatenated
together
giving
bits
the
first
bits
are
assigned
to
and
the
second
bits
to
the
rest
are
discarded
the
unit
key
u
is
the
xor
of
and
and
are
the
key
parts
that
are
separately
escrowed
with
the
two
escrow
agencies
as
a
sequence
of
values
for
and
u
are
generated
they
are
written
onto
three
separate
floppy
disks
the
first
disk
contains
a
file
for
each
serial
number
that
contains
the
corresponding
key
part
the
second
disk
is
similar
but
contains
the
values
the
third
disk
contains
the
unit
keys
u
agent
takes
the
first
disk
and
agent
takes
the
second
disk
the
third
disk
is
used
to
program
the
chips
after
the
chips
are
programmed
all
information
is
discarded
from
the
vault
and
the
agents
leave
the
laptop
may
be
destroyed
for
additional
assurance
that
no
information
is
left
behind
the
protocol
may
be
changed
slightly
so
that
four
people
are
in
the
room
instead
of
two
the
first
two
would
provide
the
seeds
and
and
the
second
two
the
escrow
agents
would
take
the
disks
back
to
the
escrow
agencies
the
escrow
agencies
have
as
yet
to
be
determined
but
they
will
not
be
the
nsa
cia
fbi
or
any
other
law
enforcement
agency
one
or
both
may
be
independent
from
the
government
law
enforcement
use
when
law
enforcement
has
been
authorized
to
tap
an
encrypted
line
they
will
first
take
the
warrant
to
the
service
provider
in
order
to
get
access
to
the
communications
line
let
us
assume
that
the
tap
is
in
place
and
that
they
have
determined
that
the
line
is
encrypted
with
clipper
they
will
first
decrypt
the
law
enforcement
block
with
the
family
key
f
this
gives
them
ek
u
n
they
will
then
take
a
warrant
identifying
the
chip
serial
number
n
to
each
of
the
key
escrow
agents
and
get
back
and
and
are
xored
together
to
produce
the
unit
key
u
and
ek
u
is
decrypted
to
get
the
session
key
k
finally
the
message
stream
is
decrypted
all
this
will
be
accomplished
through
a
special
black
box
decoder
operated
by
the
fbi
