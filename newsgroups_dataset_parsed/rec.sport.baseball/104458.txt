DAVID
VERGOLINI
WRITES
THE
ROAR
AT
MICHIGAN
AND
TRUMBULL
SHOULD
BE
LOADER
THAN
EVER
THIS
YEAR
WITH
MIKE
ILLITCH
AT
THE
HEAD
AND
ERNIE
HARWELL
BACK
AT
THE
BOOTH
THE
TIGER
BATS
WILL
BANG
THIS
SUMMER
ALREADY
THEY
HAVE
SCORED
RUNS
IN
TWO
GAMES
AND
WITH
FIELDER
TETTLETON
AND
DEER
I
THINK
THEY
CAN
WIN
THE
DIVISION
NO
PITCHING
BULL
GULLY
MOORE
WELLS
AND
KRUEGER
MAKE
UP
A
DECENT
STAFF
THAT
WILL
KEEP
THE
TEAM
INTO
MANY
GAMES
THEN
THERE
IS
HENNEMAN
TO
CLOSE
IT
OUT
WATCH
OUT
BOSTON
TORONTO
AND
BALTIMORE
THE
MOTOR
CITY
KITTYS
ARE
BACK
NICE
WOOFING
OR
SHOULD
I
SAY
MEOWING
AND
YES
THE
TIGGERS
ARE
A
FUN
EXCITING
TEAM
THAT
I
WOULD
PAY
TO
SEE
BUT
LAST
YEAR
THEY
WENT
THIS
YEAR
THEIR
OFFENSE
IS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
AND
THEIR
PITCHING
IS
AT
BEST
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
SO
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
THEY
WILL
SUDDENLY
IMPROVE
TO
WIN
THE
OR
SO
GAMES
WHICH
WILL
BE
REQUIRED
TO
WIN
THE
AL
EAST
WHAT
HAS
CHANGED
THAT
I
DONT
SEE
REMEMBER
A
WIN
IS
WORTH
AS
MUCH
IN
THE
STANDINGS
AS
A
WIN
