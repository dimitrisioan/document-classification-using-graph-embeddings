HENDERSONS
STATS
ARE
PROBABLY
CLOSER
TO

THAN
YOU
THINK
THEN
GIVE
ME
NUMBERS
MAN
WINFIELD
COULD
WHIP
HENDERSONS
BUTT
WELL
YOURE
ABSOLUTELY
COMPLETELY
DEAD
WRONG
BUT
THANKS
FOR
PLAYING
AS
SOON
AS
I
GET
TO
MY
OFFICE
ILL
BE
HAPPY
TO
POST
RICKEY
AND
DAVES
CAREER
LINES
BOTH
ARE
VERY
FINE
PLAYERS
BUT
HENDERSON
HAS
CONSISTENTLY
BEEN
BETTER
AS
FOR
RICKEY
SLACKING
DUE
TO
HIS
CONTRACT
PROBLEMS
THIS
YEAR
ANY
COMMENTS
CONSIDERING
HES
BASICALLY
PICKED
UP
THE
ENTIRE
TEAM

PUT
THEM
ON
HIS
BACK
I
THINK
HE
DESERVES
A
LITTLE
SLACK
AND
I
THINK
HE
DESERVES
A
EXTENSION
AT
PER
YEAR
QUICKLY
I
WAS
UPSET
AT
PEOPLE
DISSING
WINFIELD
HENDERSON
IS
THE
BETTER
PLAYER
WINFIELD
CAN
COME
CLOSE
THOUGH
LETS
SEE
WHAT
RICKEY
DOES
FOR
THE
REST
OF
HIS
CAREER
PEOPLE
FORGET
HOW
GOOD
WINNY
WAS
IN
THE
AND
ALSO
HOW
GREAT
RICKEY
WAS
