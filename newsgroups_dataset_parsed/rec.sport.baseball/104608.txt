DARRRRRRRRRYL
THE
MEDIA
IS
BEATING
THE
INCIDENT
AT
DODGER
STADIUM
ON
WEDNESDAY
TO
DEATH
BUT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANYTHING
IN
RSB
YET
GERALD
PERRY
OF
THE
CARDINALS
PINCH
HIT
IN
THE
EIGHTH
INNING
WITH
TWO
ON
AND
HIS
CLUB
DOWN
BY
A
RUN
HE
STROKED
A
LINE
DRIVE
INTO
THE
RIGHT
FIELD
CORNER
THE
BALL
CLEARED
THE
THREEFOOT
HIGH
FENCE
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
CROWD
DARRYL
RACING
OVER
FROM
RIGHT
CENTER
GOT
TO
THE
SPOT
IN
TIME
TO
REACH
HIS
GLOVE
UP
OVER
THE
SHORT
FENCE
BUT
HE
MISSED
THE
BALL
A
FAN
SITTING
IN
THE
FRONT
ROW
WEARING
A
MITT
REACHED
UP
AND
CAUGHT
THE
BALL
HOME
RUN
NOW
IVE
SEEN
THE
REPLAY
SEVERAL
TIMES
AND
I
HAVE
CONCLUDED
THAT
DARRYL
MISSED
THE
BALL
AND
THAT
THE
FANS
GLOVE
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
BEHIND
DARRYLS
SEVERAL
DODGER
FANS
WITH
SEATS
IN
THE
IMMEDIATE
VICINITY
HAVE
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
FAN
UNQUESTIONABLY
INTERFERED
WITH
STRAWBERRY
WHAT
CANNOT
BE
DISPUTED
HOWEVER
IS
THAT
THE
FAN
WHO
CAUGHT
THE
BALL
NEVER
TOOK
HIS
EYE
OFF
IT
HE
WAS
OBLIVIOUS
TO
WHERE
THE
FIELDER
WAS
PLAYING
HE
WAS
ALSO
QUITE
EXUBERANT
AS
SOON
AS
HE
REALIZED
HE
HAD
MADE
THE
CATCH
THAT
EXUBERANCE
DISAPPEARED
IMMEDIATELY
HOWEVER
WHEN
STRAWBERRY
WENT
INTO
A
TIRADE
AT
THE
MAN
ALL
REPORTS
INDICATE
HE
USED
A
LOT
OF
PROFANITY
AND
ACCUSED
THE
MAN
OF
INTERFERENCE
AND
THEREFORE
OF
COSTING
THE
DODGERS
A
GAME
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS
OTHER
FANS
HURLED
FOOD
AND
BEVERAGES
TOWARD
THE
MAN
WHO
MADE
THE
CATCH
DODGER
STADIUM
OFFICIALS
STARTED
TO
REMOVE
HIM
FROM
THE
PARK
BUT
THEN
RELENTED
AND
JUST
RELOCATED
HIM
TO
ANOTHER
AREA
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
AFTER
THE
GAME
LASORDA
BLAMED
THE
FAN
FOR
THE
LOSS
STRAWBERRY
ALSO
WENT
INTO
A
TIRADE
ABOUT
HOW
THE
FANS
ARE
STUPID
AND
THEY
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
WINNING
LA
TIMES
COLUMNISTS
SIMILARLY
BLASTED
THE
MAN
WHO
MADE
THE
CATCH
BEFORE
EACH
DODGER
GAME
THE
PUBLIC
ADDRESS
ANNOUNCER
MAKES
A
SPEECH
WHEREIN
HE
SAYS
THAT
FANS
ARE
WELCOME
TO
THE
SOUVENIRS
OF
BALLS
THAT
ARE
HIT
INTO
THE
STANDS
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
DO
NOT
INTERFERE
WITH
ANY
THAT
ARE
IN
THE
FIELD
OF
PLAY
WAS
THE
FAN
WRONG
SHOULD
HE
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
AWARE
OF
THE
SITUATION
AND
ACTED
TO
AVOID
ANY
POSSIBILITY
OF
INTERFERENCE
OR
WAS
HE
HUMAN
AND
JUST
REACTING
BY
THE
WAY
HE
IS
A
SEASON
TICKET
HOLDER
AND
ON
HIS
REQUEST
THE
DODGERS
HAVE
RELOCATED
HIS
SEATS
TO
ANOTHER
AREA
OF
THE
STADIUM
WHERE
FUTURE
INTERFERENCE
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
OTHERS
HAVE
QUESTIONED
WHY
DARRYL
SHOULD
BE
SO
CONCERNED
WITH
WHAT
THE
FAN
DID
WHEN
HE
HAS
A
GRAND
TOTAL
OF
RBI
THROUGH
THE
FIRST
NINE
GAMES
I
QUESTION
WHAT
HE
WAS
DOING
IN
RIGHT
CENTER
WITH
A
LEFTHANDED
PULL
HITTER
UP
AND
THE
GAME
ON
THE
LINE
HAD
HE
BEEN
CLOSER
TO
THE
PLAY
HE
CERTAINLY
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
A
MUCH
BETTER
CHANCE
OF
CATCHING
THE
BALL
BUT
I
GUESS
THE
BIG
DEBATE
CONTINUES
AS
TO
WHAT
ARE
THE
RESPONSIBILITIES
OF
THE
FAN

BEASTMASTER
