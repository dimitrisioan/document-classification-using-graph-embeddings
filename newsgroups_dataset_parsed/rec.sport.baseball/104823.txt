WARREN
USUI
WRITES
SO
ALFREDO
GRIFFIN
IS
BETTER
THAN
BARRY
LARKIN
IF
RINGS
IS
WHAT
YOURE
JUDGING
BY
THEN
I
DONT
SEE
YOUR
POINT
SINCE
BARRY
HAS
ONE
YES
BUT
ALFREDO
HAS
AT
LEAST
TWO
DODGERS
AND
BLUE
JAYS
NOT
ONLY
THAT
HE
HAS
WON
WORLD
SERIES
RINGS
FOR
MORE
DIFFERENT
TEAMS
THAN
BABE
RUTH
AND
LOU
GEHRIG
COMBINED
HOW
DO
WE
KNOW
THAT
THE
YANKEE
DYNASTY
WAS
NOT
DUE
TO
LAZARRI
BEING
AT
THIRD

I
AGREE
WITH
YOUR
PREMISE
BUT

RIGHT
HE
WAS
PART
OF
THE
RED
SOX
DYNASTY
OF
THE
AND
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
THE
YANKEE
DYNSATY
WOULDNT
HAVE
HAPPENED
WITHOUT
THIER
FAMOUS
BULLPEN
CATCHER
WHOSE
NAME
ESCAPES
ME
AT
THE
MOMENT
CUZ
