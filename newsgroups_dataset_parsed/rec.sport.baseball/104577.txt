RE
JOSE
CANSECOS
SWING
VS
IN
ARTICLE
GARY
BUILT
LIKE
VILLANUEVA
HUCKABAY
WRITES
WAS
GOING
OVER
SOME
VIDEOS
LAST
NIGHT
AND
YOU
WROTE
AN
EXCELLENT
REPORT
ABOUT
IT
HES
BULKED
UP
TOO
MUCH
PERIOD
HE
NEEDS
TO
LOSE
ABOUT
POUNDS
NOT
GAIN
MORE
BULK
HIS
BAT
SPEED
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
VANISHED
CONSERVATIVELY
ID
SAY
HES
LOST
OF
HIS
BAT
SPEED
AND
THATS
A
HUGE
AMOUNT
OF
SPEED
THAT
OPEN
STANCE
IS
KILLING
HIM
NOTE
THAT
HE
ACTS
SORT
OF
LIKE
BRIAN
DOWNING
WAY
OPEN
TO
START
THEN
CLOSES
UP
AS
BALL
IS
RELEASED
DOWNING
COULD
DO
THIS
WITHOUT
SIGNIFICANT
HEAD
MOVEMENT
CANSECO
CANT
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
CANSECO
DOESNT
ALWAYS
CLOSE
HIS
STANCE
THE
SAME
WAY
SOMETIMES
HIS
HIPS
ARE
OPEN
SOMETIMES
THEYRE
FULLY
CLOSED
WITHOUT
A
GOOD
STARTING
POINT
ITS
HARD
TO
MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS
IN
YOUR
SWING
I
UNDERSTAND
FROM
AN
UNRELIABLE
SOURCE
THAT
CANSECO
WAS
CONSIDERED
EXPENDABLE
BY
THE
AS
WHEN
HE
REFUSED
TO
ACCEPT
ANY
COACHING
ABOUT
HIS
BATTING
STANCE
THE
AS
BRAIN
TRUST
CAME
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
HIS
BACK
PROBLEMS
WERE
EXACERBATED
IF
NOT
CAUSED
BY
HAVING
A
WIDE
OPEN
STANCE
CLOSING
IT
QUICKLY
AND
THEN
SWINGING
WITH
A
LOT
OF
TORQUE
THATS
A
PARAPHRASE
OF
WHAT
I
REMEMBER
IN
ANY
EVENT
CANSECO
TOOK
THE
ROAD
THAT
HE
AND
HE
ALONE
WOULD
DECIDE
HIS
STANCE
AND
THE
AS
BEGAN
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
WOULD
EITHER
REINJURE
HIMSELF
OR
BEGIN
TO
LOSE
HIS
ABILITY
TO
HIT
FOR
BOTH
AVERAGE
AND
POWER
ASIDE
FROM
SALTING
AWAY
A
LARGE
SUM
OF
A
CASH
THAT
I
COULD
NEVER
TOUCH
SO
THAT
ID
NEVER
HAVE
TO
WORK
AGAIN
ID
RESTRUCTURE
MY
ENTIRE
SWING
APPARENTLY
YOU
SOUND
LIKE
LARUSSA
SECOND
DROP
POUNDS
CUT
OUT
THE
WEIGHT
WORK
THE
AS
ALSO
OBJECTED
ABOUT
THIS
IF
CANSECOS
OPEN
STANCE
AND
RESULTING
BAD
HABITS
ARE
A
RESULT
OF
HIS
BACK
PROBLEMS
HELL
BE
OUT
OF
BASEBALL
IN
THREE
YEARS
IF
NOT
HE
COULD
STILL
HIT
HR
AGAIN
IM
JUST
REPEATING
SOMETHING
I
HEARD
BUT
POSSIBLY
THE
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
IS
THE
REVERSE
OF
THAT
THE
BEASTMASTER
