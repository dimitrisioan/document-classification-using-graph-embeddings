RE
WHY
IS
BARRY
BONDS
NOT
BATTING
I
LIKE
THE
CLARKWILLIAMSBONDS
ORDER
PITCHERS
CAN
ONLY
WALK
CLARK
WITH
OUTS
UNLIKE
LAST
YEAR
WILLIAMS
IS
GETTING
BETTER
PITCHES
TO
HIT
WITH
BONDS
LOOMING
IN
THE
ONDECK
CIRCLE
SINCE
MATT
HAS
A
TERRIBLE
BATTING
EYE
THIS
HELPS
THE
GIANTS
A
LOT
WHEN
BONDS
GETS
ON
BASE
ALL
BY
HIMSELF
HE
CAN
TRY
TO
STEAL
AND
THEN
BE
DRIVEN
IN
WITH
A
SINGLE
BY
THOMPSON
MANWARING
OR
CLAYTON
IF
YOU
BAT
BONDS
BEFORE
THE
OTHER
SLUGGERS
THEN
YOU
DONT
WANT
HIM
TO
RUN
BECAUSE
A
CAUGHT
STEALING
COULD
TAKE
YOU
OUT
OF
A
BIG
INNING
ALSO
BONDS
IS
LESS
IN
NEED
OF
PROTECTION
BEHIND
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
IS
SUCH
A
GOOD
BASE
STEALER
A
WALK
IS
A
POTENTIAL
DOUBLE
THE
ONLY
DRAW
BACK
IS
WHEN
CLARK
AND
WILLIAMS
ARE
CLOGGING
UP
THE
BASES
INFRONT
OF
BONDS
AND
I
THINK
THATS
A
PROBLEM
THE
GIANTS
WILL
BE
GLAD
TO
SEE
ESPECIALLY
IF
ROBBY
THOMPSON
GETS
HOT
