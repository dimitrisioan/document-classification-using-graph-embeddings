RE
HOW
TO
SPEED
UP
GAMES
MARGINALLY
REALISTIC
DAVID
MADDEN
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
GARY
BUILT
LIKE
VILLANUEVA
HUCKABAY
WRITES
YOU
WANT
TO
SPEED
UP
BALLGAMES
MANDATE
A
RULE
PERMITTING
ONLY
N
SECONDS
BETWEEN
PITCHES
THE
CURRENT
RULE
IS
TOO
LENIENT
AND
THEN
ENFORCE
IT
FIFTEEN
SECONDS
IS
MORE
PLEASE
PARDON
MY
IGNORANCE
IF
THIS
IS
WELL
KNOWN
BUT
WHAT
IS
THE
CURRENT
RULE
THAN
ENOUGH
TIME
IF
THE
PITCH
ISNT
RELEASED
IN
CALL
IT
A
BALL
AND
RESTART
THE
CLOCK
I
REMEMBER
A
POST
FROM
LAST
YEAR
INDICATING
THAT
A
PITCH
CLOCK
WAS
TRIED
IN
ONE
OF
THE
MINOR
LEAGUES
SOME
TIME
BACK
AND
DID
NOT
WORK
I
DONT
REMEMBER
WHY
THEY
SAID
THAT
IT
DID
NOT
WORK
ANYONE
REMEMBER
THIS
JODY
MCDONNEL
ON
WIP
IN
PHIL
HAS
BEEN
SAYING
THAT
A
PITCH
CLOCK
WAS
INEVITABLE
HOW
WOULD
A
PITCH
CLOCK
WORK
ON
THROWS
TO
FIRST
MAYBE
WE
COULD
LIMIT
THE
NUMBER
OF
THROWS
TO
FIRST
THAT
THE
PITCHER
CAN
MAKE
AND
AWARD
A
BALK
IF
HE
EXCEEDS
IT
ID
HAVE
ANOTHER
QUESTION
WHO
WOULD
OPERATE
THE
PITCH
CLOCK
ONE
OF
THE
UMPIRES
ADD
ANOTHER
ONE
TO
THE
CREW
ANOTHER
PAIR
OF
SUGGESTIONS
REMOVE
THE
BALK
RULE
IT
IS
THE
RUNNERS
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
STAY
SAFE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
PITCHER
DOES
IM
NOT
SURE
I
LIKE
THIS
IDEA
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
SEVERELY
DIMINISH
THE
NUMBER
OF
STOLEN
BASES
AND
LIMIT
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
SUCH
NEAT
STRATEGIC
PLOYS
AS
THE
HIT
AND
RUN
AND
THE
SQUEEZE
PLAY
ONE
OF
MY
PERSONAL
FAVORITES
IF
A
PITCHER
THROWS
TO
AN
OCCUPIED
BASE
MORE
THAN
X
TIME
X
TO
WITHOUT
SUCCESSFULLY
PICKING
OFF
THE
RUNNER
THE
RUNNER
ADVANCES
A
BASE
AS
IF
WALKED
AHHH
I
SUPPOSE
I
SHOULD
READ
THE
WHOLE
ARTICLE
BEFORE
I
HIT
THE
F
KEY
EH
OBVIOUSLY
FROM
WHAT
I
WROTE
ABOVE
I
LIKE
THIS
IDEA
THE
NOBALK
SEEMS
TO
GIVE
THE
PITCHER
THE
ADVANTAGE
THE
BASEWALK
ALLOWS
THE
RUNNER
TO
CHALLENGE
PITCHER
TO
THROW
OVER
TO
THE
BASE
IT
MAY
ALSO
INCREASE
THE
NUMBER
OF
WILD
THROWS
TO
THE
BAG
SINCE
THE
PITCHER
KNOWS
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
VERY
MANY
CHANCES
TO
PICK
OFF
THE
RUNNER
SO
HE
MAY
HURRY
TOO
MUCH
ID
RATHER
SEE
RUNS
SCORED
AS
THE
RESULT
OF
SOUND
HITTING
AND
SOUND
BASEBALL
STRATEGY
RATHER
THAN
ON
THE
SLOPPINESS
THAT
COULD
RESULT
FROM
THIS
KIND
OF
RULE
SO
I
SUPPOSE
THERE
ARE
SOME
DISADVANTAGES
TO
THAT
IDEA
TOO
BASEBALL
GAMES
TAKE
ABOUT
IN
THE
NL
AND
JUST
A
SHADE
UNDER
HOURS
IN
THE
AL
THATS
JUST
TOO
DAMN
LONG
I
DONT
LIKE
TO
PLAY
IN
HOUR
GAMES
MUCH
LESS
WATCH
A
GAME
FOR
THAT
LONG
MY
BUTT
FALLS
ASLEEP
AND
IF
IM
WATCHING
ON
TV
ILL
CHANNEL
SURF
BETWEEN
PITCHES
CATCHING
COLORIZED
VERSIONS
OF
MR
ED
LEAVE
IT
TO
BEAVER
AND
THOSE
WACKY
NIEPORENTS
ON
NICK
AT
NITE
I
TOO
FIND
MYSELF
SURFING
WHEN
I
KNOW
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
ENOUGH
TIME
BETWEEN
EACH
PITCH
TO
ALLOW
THE
BATTER
TO
ADJUST
HIS
JEWLERY
I
REMEMBER
IN
LITTLE
LEAGUE
IF
WHEN
UP
TO
BAT
WE
STEPPED
OUT
OF
THE
BATTERS
BOX
EVEN
FOR
A
MOMENT
WE
WERE
AUTOMATICALLY
OUT
THAT
MAY
BE
A
LITTLE
HARSH
FOR
THE
MAJORS
BUT
SERIOUSLY
HOW
ABOUT
PUTTING
A
LIMIT
ON
THE
BATTERS
BEING
ABLE
TO
STEP
OUT
TAKE
SEVERAL
DOZEN
PRACTICE
SWINGS
POUND
THEIR
SHOES
SCRATCH
THEIR
BALLS
ETC
MAYBE
FORCING
THEM
TO
STAY
IN
THE
BATTERS
BOX
WOULDNT
BE
SUCH
A
BAD
IDEA
THAT
COULD
SAVE
A
FEW
MINUTES
RANDY
