ROBERT
AND
STIMETS
WRITES
IN
A
GAME
THAT
SAW
A
LITTLE
OF
EVERYTHINGINCREDIBLE
DEFENSE
SOME
POWER
CLUTCH
PITCHING
AND
A
LITTLE
WILDNESSTHE
REDS
MANAGED
TO
OVERCOME
THEIR
TRADEMARK
LACK
OF
TIMELY
HITTING
IN
CRUCIAL
SITUATIONS
DURING
SPRING
TRAINING
I
MADE
A
SIMILARLY
INNONCENTLOOKING
COMMENT
ABOUT
CLUTCH
HITTING
ON
THIS
BB
AND
THE
FLAMES
WERE
FLYING
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
CLUTCH
HITTING
THEY
THE
SDCNS
ALL
SCREAMED
I
ASSUMED
THEY
ALSO
MEANT
THERE
WAS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
ANY
KIND
OF
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
GIVEN
THEIR
COMMENTS
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
THE
CASE
THERE
IS
NO
SIGNIFICANT
ABILITY
TOI
PERFORM
IN
THE
CLUTCH
BUT
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
CERTAINLY
HAPPENS
EVERY
TIME
THERE
IS
A
GAMEWINNING
HIT
THE
CLUTCH
PITCHING
QUOTED
ABOVE
IS
SOMETHING
WHICH
HAPPENED
NOT
A
CLAIM
THAT
ANY
PARTICULAR
PLAYER
SHOULD
BE
EXPECTED
TO
BE
A
CLUTCH
PITCHER
OVER
THE
PAST
FOUR
SEASONS
SABO
HAS
HAD
HITS
IN
ABS
DEFINED
AS
CLUTCH
SITUATIONS
BY
THE
SCOUTING
REPORT
FOR
AN
AVERAGE
OF
OVER
THAT
SAME
PERIOD
HE
HAD
ANOTHER
ABS
WITH
HITS
FOR
AN
AVERAGE
OF
ACCORDING
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
SDCNS
ANY
DIFFERENTIAL
SUCH
AS
THIS
IS
COMPLETELY
AND
TOTALLY
RANDOM
AND
CANNOT
BE
USED
FOR
ANY
REASONABLE
INFERENCE
SUCH
AS
PERHAPS
PEREZ
SHOULD
HAVE
USED
A
PINCH
HITTER
IN
THAT
SITUATION
SIMPLE
STATISTICS
TELL
ME
THAT
THERE
IS
A
CHANCE
AN
AVERAGE
CLUTCH
HITTER
WOULD
HAVE
THIS
LARGE
A
SPLIT
THE
AVERAGE
DECREASE
IS
POINTS
STANDARD
DEVIATION
ABOUT
THERE
WILL
BE
SUCH
HITTERS
IN
ANY
LEAGUE
JUST
AS
THERE
WILL
BE
HITTERS
WHO
HIT
POORLY
ON
TUESDAYS
AND
THERE
IS
ONLY
A
VERY
WEAK
CORRELATION
IN
MY
BEST
STUDY
BETWEEN
CLUTCH
HITTING
IN
THE
LAST
FOUR
YEARS
AND
CLUTCH
HITTING
THIS
YEAR
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
THE
CLUTCH
DATA
IS
DETERMINAED
BY
LUCK
RATHER
THAN
ANY
ABILITY
BASED
ONLY
ON
THIS
DATA
I
DONT
SEE
ANY
REASON
TO
PINCHHIT
FOR
SABO
OR
ANY
OTHER
PLAYER
WHO
HAD
BEEN
A
POOR
CLUTCH
HITTER
IN
THE
PAST
BUT
THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHER
FACTORS
INVOLVED
IN
A
DECISION
TO
PINCHHIT
DOES
THE
PINCHHITTER
GIVE
YOU
A
PLATOON
ADVANTAGE
ANY
PORTION
OF
SABOS
CLUTCH
SPLIT
THAT
RESULTS
FROM
HIS
PLATOON
SPLIT
IS
CERTAINLY
A
REAL
ABILITY
EVEN
IF
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
CLUTCH
HITTING
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
SINGLES
HITTER
AT
THE
PLATE
WHEN
YOU
NEED
A
HOME
RUN
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
CURVEBALL
PITCHER
FACING
A
BATTER
WHO
HAS
TROUBLE
WITH
CURVES
