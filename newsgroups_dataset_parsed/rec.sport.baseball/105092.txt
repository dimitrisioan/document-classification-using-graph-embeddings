ROGER
LUSTIG
WRITES
RIGHT
SO
WHO
CARES
WHICH
PLAYER
GETS
CREDITED
AS
LONG
AS
THE
TEAM
GETS
MORE
RUNS
IF
A
PLAYER
HELPS
THE
TEAM
GET
MORE
R
AND
RBI
BUT
DOESNT
SCORE
THEM
ALL
HIMSELF
WHO
CARES
AMUSING
ISNT
IT
SEEMS
ONLY
THE
SDCNS
REALIZE
HOW
MUCH
BASEBALL
IS
A
TEAM
GAME
COMBINING
EFFORTS
FROM
EVERY
PLAYER
FOR
THE
WIN
CONSIDER
THE
RED
SOX
GAME
LAST
NIGHT
THE
SOX
WON
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
WHO
WON
THE
GAME
CLEMENS
PITCHED
A
STRONG
NINE
INNINGS
ALLOWING
ONLY
TWO
RUNS
RYAN
PITCHED
A
COUPLE
SHUTOUT
INNINGS
THOUGH
HE
NEEDED
SOME
EXCELLENT
DEFENSIVE
PLAYS
BEHIND
HIM
TO
DO
SO
QUANTRILL
PITCHED
A
COUPLE
OF
INNINGS
GAVE
UP
THE
GOAHEAD
RUN
AND
GOT
CREDITED
WITH
THE
WIN
WHEN
THE
SOX
SCORED
TWO
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
INNING
LOOKS
LIKE
A
TEAM
EFFORT
TO
ME
YET
ONLY
QUANTRILL
GOT
CREDIT
FOR
THE
WIN
HOW
ABOUT
THE
OFFENSE
DAWSON
AND
VAUGHN
HIT
I
THINK
HRS
EARLY
IN
THE
GAME
WITHOUT
EITHER
ONE
THE
SOX
WOULD
HAVE
LOST
IN
NINE
QUINTANA
LED
OFF
THE
WITH
A
SOLID
SINGLE
ZUPCIC
PINCHRAN
FOR
QUINTANA
PROVIDING
THE
SPEED
TO
GO
FROM
FIRST
TO
THIRD
WHEN
COOPER
RIPPED
A
SECOND
SINGLE
IN
THE
INNING
MELVIN
AVOIDED
THE
DP
GETTING
THE
RUN
HOME
WITH
A
SAC
FLY
NOT
MUCH
OF
A
HELP
BUT
IT
WAS
SOMETHING
SCRUB
RICHARDSON
THEN
HIT
A
DOUBLE
SCORING
THE
SPEEDY
COOPER
ALL
THE
WAY
FROM
FIRST
HILLS
LACK
OF
DEFENSE
HELPED
COOPER
AND
ZUPCIC
WERE
CREDITED
WITH
RUNS
MELVIN
AND
RICHARDSON
WERE
CREDITED
WITH
RBIS
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
IT
WAS
QUINTANAS
HIT
THAT
SET
UP
THE
WHOLE
INNING
AND
DID
MELVIN
REALLY
CONTRIBUTE
AS
MUCH
AS
RICHARDSON
FURTHERMORE
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
CONSIDER
RBIS
TO
BE
MORE
SIGNIFICANT
THAN
RUNS
DID
MELVIN
CONTRIBUTE
MORE
THAN
COOPER
COOPER
PROVIDED
THE
GAMEWINNING
BASERUNNER
AND
MOVED
THE
TYING
RUN
TO
THIRD
BASE
WITH
ONLY
ONE
OUT
ASSIGNING
CREDIT
BASED
ON
RUNS
AND
RBIS
IS
CLEARLY
RIDICULOUS
YOU
CAN
ARGUE
THAT
OBP
AND
SLG
DONT
SHOW
YOU
WHO
CAME
THROUGH
IN
THE
CLUTCH
BUT
RRBI
DONT
DO
ANY
BETTER
AT
LEAST
OBP
AND
SLG
DONT
CLAIM
TO
TRY
TO
TELL
YOU
THAT
HERES
TO
THE
RED
SOX
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
LAST
NIGHTS
VICTORY
ALL
OF
THEM
VALENTINE
