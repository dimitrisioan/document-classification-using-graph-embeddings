RE
THE
METS
ARE
RAPISTS
WRITES
IN
THE
NEW
BOOK
ABOUT
THE
METS
IT
TALKS
ABOUT
HOW
THEY
LIKE
TO
RAPE
LITTLE
GIRLS
BEFORE
GAMES
SICK
JERKS
MAX
IS
THIS
THE
BOOK
BY
BOB
KLAPISCH
SPELLING
THE
WORST
TEAM
MONEY
CAN
BUY
IF
IT
IS
I
WOULDNT
GIVE
THE
BOOK
OR
ANYTHING
IN
IT
ANY
VALUE
WHATSOEVER
KLAPISCH
WROTE
THE
BOOK
TO
MAKE
MONEY
OBVIOUSLY
AND
SENSATIONAL
LITERATURE
IS
GOING
TO
SELL
A
LOT
BETTER
THAN
WHAT
HE
USUALLY
WRITES
FOR
THE
PAPERS
IM
NOT
CALLING
HIM
A
LIAR
BUT
IF
THERE
WAS
ANY
PROOF
THAT
A
MET
PLAYER
HAD
RAPED
A
LITTLE
GIRL
BEFORE
A
GAME
LET
ALONE
DOING
IT
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
THEY
WOULD
BE
IN
JAIL
NOT
SHEA
FOR
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
PRESS
IS
LIKE
IN
NEW
YORK
IT
IS
PROBABLY
MORE
CUTTHROAT
THAN
IN
JUST
ABOUT
ANY
OTHER
PART
OF
THE
US
KEITH
HERNANDEZ
SAID
IT
VERY
WELL
ON
ESPN
A
COUPLE
OF
DAYS
AGO
THEY
WOULD
MUCH
RATHER
MENTION
A
CLUBHOUSE
FIGHT
THAN
A
TWORUN
HOMER
IN
THE
NINTH
TO
WIN
A
GAME
I
DO
NOT
READ
KLAPISCHS
NEWS
COLUMNS
REGULARLY
BUT
I
DO
KNOW
THAT
HE
HAS
BEEN
ACCUSED
BEFORE
AS
BEING
AN
INSTIGATOR
THAT
ENJOYS
HOPEFULLY
FOR
ONLY
PROFESSIONAL
REASONS
TO
DRUMB
UP
A
NEWS
STORY
EVEN
IF
THERE
ISNT
ONE
THERE
NOW
AS
FAR
AS
THE
CONFRONTATION
WITH
BOBBY
BONILLA
A
FEW
DAYS
AGO
I
ALMOST
TOTALLY
BLAME
BONILLA
NO
MATTER
WHAT
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
PRESS
DOES
AND
NO
MATTER
HOW
MUCH
OF
A
PUTRID
INDIVIDUAL
HE
MIGHT
BE
THAT
DOES
NOT
GIVE
A
BALLPLAYER
THE
RIGHT
TO
THREATEN
A
JOURNALIST
PERSONALLY
I
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
A
BEAT
WRITER
THAT
ALWAYS
FOLLOWS
A
CLUB
AROUND
SHOULD
REPORT
THE
NEWS
BUT
NOT
BE
LOOKING
TO
DEGRADE
A
TEAM
I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
TO
BLAME
KLAPISCH
BECAUSE
THAT
MAY
BE
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
KEEP
A
JOB
IN
NEW
YORK
