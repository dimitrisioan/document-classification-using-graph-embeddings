when
i
say
black
i
mean
usborn
black
people
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
hispanic
players
were
in
baseball
before
and
one
team
in
the
signed
lots
of
hispanics
because
they
went
over
better
with
the
local
audience
than
blacks
did
what
about
black
hispanics
good
question
its
my
impression
not
backed
by
evidence
that
general
southoftheborderness
seems
to
exempt
one
from
the
hiringfiring
effect
i
was
talking
about
back
in
the
there
were
some
attempts
to
hire
black
cuban
ballplayers
they
were
rejected
by
the
commissioner
and
others
and
why
would
more
hispanics
stick
around
than
blacks
dont
know
but
remember
this
is
the
country
that
had
special
racial
laws
for
one
group
and
one
group
only
blacks
our
national
history
man
you
had
better
do
some
serious
reading
i
really
really
doubt
that
you
meant
to
say
this
well
what
did
i
mean
to
say
aside
from
some
shortlived
exceptions
such
as
japanese
internment
in
ww
ii
only
blacks
were
affected
by
laws
regarding
slavery
jim
crow
miscegenation
military
service
etc
if
my
claim
of
exclusivity
is
not
airtight
that
is
if
you
can
come
up
with
this
or
that
exception
fine
have
a
cookie
but
compared
to
this
list
no
other
racial
group
put
up
with
a
legal
onslaught
worth
discussing
at
length
