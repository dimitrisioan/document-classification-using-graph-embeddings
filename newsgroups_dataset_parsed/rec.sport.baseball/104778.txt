later
in
the
ninth
inning
with
the
bases
loaded
and
two
outs
he
puts
lankford
a
hitter
with
power
in
as
a
pinch
runner
and
uses
luis
alicea
a
hitter
with
no
power
as
a
pinch
hitter
what
the
helll
is
he
thinking
if
memory
serves
me
well
alicea
hit
it
and
damn
near
tied
the
game
torre
obviously
knows
his
players
better
than
you
do
not
to
mention
that
lankford
had
been
hurt
two
nights
before
running
into
the
outfield
wall
this
being
the
reason
he
was
available
to
pinch
anything
his
ribs
were
the
problem
so
he
could
run
but
not
hit
torre
is
no
white
rat
but
give
him
credit
for
what
he
is
a
pretty
darn
good
manager
with
the
exception
of
the
felix
fiasco
but
im
not
sure
whos
brainchild
that
was
bil

anyone
anyone
please
