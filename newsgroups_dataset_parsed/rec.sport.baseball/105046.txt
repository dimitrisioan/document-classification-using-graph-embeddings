WRITES
WHILE
WERE
ON
THE
MULTIPURPOSE
SUBJECT
LETS
NOT
FORGET
SHEA
WHICH
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
ACCOMMODATE
BOTH
THE
METS
JETS
IT
WAS
THE
FIRST
STADIUM
I
THINK
TO
HAVE
THE
BOX
SEATS
ON
ROLLERS
SO
THEY
COULD
BE
ORIENTED
AT
RIGHT
ANGLES
FOR
BASEBALL
IN
PARALLEL
FOR
FOOTBALL
MINOR
POINT
SHEA
STADIUM
WAS
DESIGNED
AS
A
MULTIPURPOSE
STADIUM
BUT
NOT
WITH
THE
JETS
IN
MIND
AS
THE
TENNANT
THE
NEW
YORK
FOOTBALL
GIANTS
HAD
MOVED
TO
YANKEE
STADIUM
FROM
THE
POLO
GROUNDS
IN
AND
WAS
HAVING
PROBLEM
WITH
STADIUM
MANAGEMENT
THE
CITY
DID
NOT
OWN
YANKEE
STADIUM
UNTIL
THE
IDEA
WAS
TO
GET
THE
GIANTS
TO
MOVE
INTO
SHEA
WHEN
A
DEAL
WAS
WORKED
OUT
BETWEEN
THE
GIANTS
AND
THE
YANKEES
THE
NEW
AFL
FRANCHISE
THE
NEW
YORK
TITANS
APPROACHED
THE
CITY
ABOUT
USING
THE
NEW
STADIUM
THE
TITANS
WERE
PLAYING
IN
DOWNING
STADIUM
WHERE
THE
COSMOS
PLAYED
SOCCER
IN
THE
BECAUSE
SHEA
STADIUM
WAS
TIED
INTO
THE
WORLDS
FAIR
ANYWAY
THE
CITY
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
NOVEL
IDEA
TO
PROMOTE
THE
NEW
FRANCHISE
AND
THE
WORLDS
FAIR
LIKE
THEY
WERE
DOING
WITH
THE
METS
SO
THE
DEAL
WAS
WORKED
OUT
OF
COURSE
WITH
THE
JETS
GONE
TO
JERSEY
AND
A
TRULY
GOOD
FOOTBALL
STADIUM
THE
METS
ARE
SADDLED
WITH
A
MULTIPURPOSE
STADIUM
WHERE
BECAUSE
ITS
CIRCULAR
THE
SEATS
ARE
ALMOST
ALWAYS
TOO
FAR
FROM
THE
ACTION
THE
METS
ANNOUNCERSKINER
MURPHY
IN
PARTICULARHAVE
ALWAYS
HYPED
IT
AS
BEAUTIFUL
SHEA
STADIUM
A
TIPOFF
TO
HOW
UNBEAUTIFUL
IT
TRULY
IS
IM
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
WHEN
MURPH
SAYS
IT
HE
MEANS
IT
AS
A
REGULAR
GOER
TO
SHEA
IT
IS
NOT
A
BAD
PLACE
SINCE
THEYVE
CLEANED
AND
RENOVATED
THE
PLACE
REMEMBER
THIS
IS
ITS
