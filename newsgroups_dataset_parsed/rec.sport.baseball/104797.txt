most
of
the
points
you
made
about
lopez
v
berryhillolson
have
been
made
by
others
and
realizing
that
lopez
must
be
the
second
coming
of
frank
thomas
i
have
relented
and
praised
the
unmistakeable
wisdom
of
his
supporters
nope
theyre
baseball
management
possible
the
most
shortsighted
collection
of
people
in
the
nation
do
you
not
believe
this
goes
on
mark
do
you
think
frank
thomas
needed
those
three
months
in
aaa
in
see
this
is
essentially
what
everyone
was
doing
comparing
lopez
to
one
of
the
best
players
in
the
game
im
really
looking
forward
to
seeing
this
cantmiss
superstar
now
as
for
thomas
i
remember
being
an
advocate
of
his
being
brought
up
in
even
though
he
was
only
or
cant
remember
but
who
did
the
sox
have
at
first
calderon
martinez
kittle
the
spot
was
there
the
talent
was
there
sure
i
say
go
for
it
i
am
not
convinced
that
lopez
is
anywhere
near
as
talented
as
thomas
was
after
his
aa
season
in
and
i
am
not
convinced
that
olson
berryhill
are
nearly
as
bad
as
kittlemartinez
were
btw
i
dont
think
thomas
was
hurt
by
those
three
months
or
cal
eldred
wasnt
really
better
than
ricky
bones
last
year
well
if
we
cant
compare
our
guy
to
one
of
the
best
in
the
game
lets
compare
our
decision
to
one
of
the
most
boneshead
right
cal
eldred
was
when
he
came
up
with
a
full
season
at
aaa
and
a
longer
minor
league
career
frankly
i
dont
know
why
he
didnt
make
the
club
in
bones
is
a
year
younger
with
a
lousy
prior
history
and
just
watching
him
makes
me
think
that
i
missed
a
career
as
a
bigleague
pitcher
no
one
i
repeat
no
one
laughed
louder
than
i
did
at
the
sheffield
trade
though
i
guess
mieske
has
a
future
i
take
it
back
mcilvaine
may
have
laughed
louder
youre
mostly
polite
make
defensible
if
flawed
cases
have
wit
and
have
in
the
past
admitted
being
wrong
that
does
qualify
you
on
rsb
well
make
an
sdcn
out
of
you
yet
aw
gee
shucks
thanks
guy
except
i
missed
the
part
where
sdcns
admit
theyre
wrong
