EARLY
AND
OFTEN
BY
THE
HEAVILY
RIGHTUNBALANCED
REDS
LINEUP
WHICH
MANAGED
SOME
RECENTLY
RARE
POWER
WITH
THEIR
BATS
BELCHER
WAS
SOLID
THROUGHOUT
AND
IN
FACT
SEEMED
TO
GET
STRONGER
AS
THE
GAME
PROGRESSED
EARLY
ON
HE
HAD
SEVERAL
THREEBALL
COUNTS
BUT
EVEN
THOSE
WERE
FEW
AND
FAR
BETWEEN
LATER

HE
ALLOWED
ONLY

WHILE
STRIKING
OUT
NINE
IN

INTERVIEW
HE
SAID

SAY
SO
ALL
NINE
OF
HIS
STRIKEOUTS
WERE
APPARENTLY
ON

THEY
ALL
STRUCK

KELLY
MANAGED
A
SCORE
ANYWAY
DUE
TO
A
DOUBLESTEAL
AND
A
TOMLIN
WILD
PITCH
IN
FACT
IT
APPEARED
THAT
TOMLIN
WAS
GOING
TO
RECOVER
NICELY
FROM
HIS
SHAKY
START
HE
RETIRED
OF
THE
NEXT
BATTERS
TO
GET
TO
THE
FOURTH
BEHIND
ONLY
RANDY
MILLIGAN

HAD
DIFFERENT
IDEAS
AS
