i
suspect
that
splits
such
as
these
are
the
result
of
positioning
an
outfielder
who
is
fast
and
gets
a
good
jump
would
be
expected
to
catch
a
lot
of
balls
preventing
both
singles
and
doubles
and
also
cut
off
more
uncatchable
balls
turinging
doubles
into
singles
however
a
fielder
who
plays
shallow
will
catch
more
short
flies
and
fewer
long
flies
this
means
that
he
will
allow
fewer
singles
but
more
doubles
has
anyone
seen
these
players
positioning
do
butler
and
felix
play
deep
and
lankford
martinez
and
wilson
shallow
or
is
this
a
park
effect
i
thought
butler
liked
to
play
shallow
