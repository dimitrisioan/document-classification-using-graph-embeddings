I
SUSPECT
THAT
SPLITS
SUCH
AS
THESE
ARE
THE
RESULT
OF
POSITIONING
AN
OUTFIELDER
WHO
IS
FAST
AND
GETS
A
GOOD
JUMP
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
TO
CATCH
A
LOT
OF
BALLS
PREVENTING
BOTH
SINGLES

DOUBLES
AND
ALSO
CUT

UNCATCHABLE
BALLS

INTO

HOWEVER
A
FIELDER
WHO
PLAYS
SHALLOW
WILL
CATCH
MORE
SHORT
FLIES
AND
FEWER
LONG
FLIES
THIS
MEANS
THAT
HE
WILL
ALLOW
FEWER
SINGLES
