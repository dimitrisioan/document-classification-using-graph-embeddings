WRITES
HOWEVER
WHAT
IS
WITH
THIS
POLICY
OF
TRYING
TO
SPEED
UP
THE
GAMES
I
AGREE
WITH
NICK
WHATS
THE
BIG
DEAL
ABOUT
LONG
GAMES
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
WATCH
BASEBALL
THERES
THAT
MUCH
MORE
BASEBALL
TO
WATCH
AND
YES
BASEBALL
INCLUDES
THE
SPACE
BETWEEN
PLAYS
AS
WELL
AS
THE
PLAYS
THEMSELVES
I
HESITATE
TO
MAKE
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHEN
THEY
WRITE
BUT
NEITHER
OF
YOU
TWO
SOUND
AS
THOUGH
YOU
HAVE
KIDS
AND
YOU
MAY
NOT
HAVE
SPOUSES
EITHER
CONSIDER
A
NIGHT
GAME
STARTING
AT
PM
EST
IT
WAS
LAST
YEAR
BUT
CLEVELAND
SHOWED
WHAT
I
THOUGHT
WAS
GOOD
SENSE
IN
PUSHING
IT
BACK
I
GO
AND
IM
INTO
IT
UNTIL
PM
MINIMUM
EXTRA
INNINGS
COULD
PUT
ME
WELL
PAST
MIDNIGHT
EVEN
WITHOUT
EXTRA
INNINGS
IF
THE
SCORE
IS
BEYOND
I
CANT
SEE
MY
FAMILY
THAT
NIGHT
AT
ALL
IF
THE
NEXT
DAY
IS
A
WORKDAY
I
MAY
HAVE
TO
BAG
THAT
AS
WELL
FURTHER
THE
LATER
THE
GAME
GOES
THE
COLDER
IT
GETS
ON
THE
SHORE
OF
LAKE
ERIE
ALL
THAT
STUFF
ENTERS
INTO
MY
CONSIDERATION
OF
EVEN
GOING
TO
A
GAME
IF
YOU
SAY
YOU
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
GAME
IS
SPED
UP
IMPO
YOU
ARE
SAYING
YOU
DONT
CARE
WHERE
THE
TIME
GOES
AND
THAT
THE
GAME
IS
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
HAVE
FAMILIES
AND
DONT
HAVE
TO
GET
UP
FOR
WORK
THE
NEXT
DAY
RG
I
CAN
PLAY
ME
BETTER
THAN
ANYONE
THERES
ONLY
ONE
OF
ME
BARRY
BONDS
ON
PLAYING
HIMSELF
IN
TWO
MOVIES
