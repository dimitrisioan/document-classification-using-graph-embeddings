RE
JEWISH
BASEBALL
PLAYERS
IN
ARTICLE
MSSNETCOMCOM
MARK
SINGER
WRITES
POLISH
AND
JEWISH
ARE
NOT
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
I
DIDNT
MEAN
TO
OFFEND
OR
ANYTHING
IM
JUST
QUOTING
STANKY
HIMSELF
ON
THE
SUBJECT
I
REMEMBER
ONE
TIME
LAST
YEAR
HE
WAS
BEING
INTERVIEWED
BY
ESPN
AND
THE
INTERVIEWER
CANT
REMEMBER
WHO
ASKED
STANKY
IF
HE
WAS
JEWISH
BECAUSE
HE
THE
INTERVIEWER
WAS
JEWISH
AND
WANTED
TO
SEE
MORE
JEWISH
BALLPLAYERS
TO
WHICH
STANKY
REPLIED
IM
POLISH
NOT
JEWISH
SO
MAYBE
THAT
WASNT
THE
MOST
PC
THING
FOR
STANKY
TO
SAY
AND
MAYBE
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
NAIVE
WHEN
I
POSTED
IT
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
JUST
DEVOTE
THIS
SUBJECT
TO
FINDING
ACTUAL
JEWISH
BALLPLAYERS
I
MYSELF
AM
JEWISH
AND
THE
ONLY
ONES
I
EVER
KNEW
UNTIL
NOW
WERE
KOUFAX
GREENBERG
AND
BLOMBERG
ALAN
