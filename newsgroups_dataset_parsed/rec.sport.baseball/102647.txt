RE
ESPN
AND
EXPANSION
IN
ARTICLE
DONNIE
TRUMP
WRITES
I
WAS
WATCHING
PETER
GAMMONS
ON
ESPN
LAST
NIGHT
AND
HES
GOT
ME
A
LITTLE
CONFUSED
WHILE
TALKING
ABOUT
EXPANSION
HE
STARTED
MENTIONING
PEOPLE
WHO
MIGHT
BENEFIT
FROM
THE
FRINGE
PLAYERS
THEYLL
BE
FACING
MCGRIFF
HITTING
HOME
RUNS
SHEFFIELD
GETTING
RBIS
AND
GLAVINE
WINNING
GAMES
THIS
WAS
OF
COURSE
ALL
IN
REFERENCE
TO
WHAT
HAPPENED
THE
OTHER
TIMES
THAT
BASEBALL
HAS
EXPANDED
EARLY
LATE
LATE
WHAT
REALLY
CONFUSED
ME
THOUGH
WAS
THE
MENTION
OF
AL
PLAYERS
WHO
WOULD
DO
WELL
NEXT
YEAR
SPECIFICALLY
ROGER
CLEMENS
WINNING
GAMES
AND
THE
LIKES
OF
MCGWIRE
AND
GONZALEZ
HITTING
HOME
RUNS
MY
QUESTION
IS
HOW
IN
THE
HELL
WILL
THE
ROCKIESMARLINS
HELP
THE
AL
THE
LAST
TIME
I
LOOKED
THERE
WASNT
A
LOT
OF
TALENT
JUMPING
LEAGUES
DID
I
MISS
SOMETHING
ONLY
IF
YOU
PERSIST
IN
BELIEVING
THAT
PETER
GAMMONS
IS
MORE
KNOWLEDGABLE
ABOUT
BASEBALL
THAN
THE
AVERAGE
MAILBOX
OKAY
IM
OVERSTATING
STILL
THE
MAN
ACTUALLY
HAD
THE
GALL
TO
SAY
THAT
ONE
OUT
OF
EVERY
SIX
PITCHERS
IN
THE
NL
THIS
YEAR
DID
NOT
PITCH
IN
THE
MAJORS
LAST
YEAR
HUH
IMO
THIS
EXPANSION
WILL
NOT
SEE
THE
EXPLOSIVE
JUMP
IN
OFFENSE
THAT
THE
OTHER
EXPANSION
DRAFTS
HAD
SINCE
THE
TALENT
WAS
DILUTED
OVER
BOTH
LEAGUES
IN
GAMMONS
DEFENSE
BECAUSE
THE
TALENT
DRAIN
CAME
FROM
THE
AL
AS
WELL
SOME
INCREASE
WILL
BE
SEEN
HE
ALSO
GETS
CREDIT
FOR
MENTIONING
THAT
THE
JUMP
IN
OFFENSE
WAS
DUE
ALSO
TO
THE
RULES
CHANGES
AFTER
THE
SEASON
HES
STILL
FULL
OF
IT
KURT
BOSE
AS
IN
DAISY
NOT
ROSE
KBOSCARINAUNMEDU
IF
YOU
TAKE
OUT
ALL
THE
FKS
THIS
IS
