JOSE
CANSECOS
SWING
VS
WAS
GOING
OVER
SOME
VIDEOS
LAST
NIGHT
STUDYING
AND
VIDEOTAPES
OF
JOSE
CANSECO
PROVED
TO
BE
VERY
INTERESTING
AND
ENLIGHTENING
HERES
MY
ANALYSIS
OF
JOSE
CANSECO
CIRCA
SEP
AND
JOSE
CANSECO
CIRCA
JUNE
HES
BULKED
UP
TOO
MUCH
PERIOD
HE
NEEDS
TO
LOSE
ABOUT
POUNDS
NOT
GAIN
MORE
BULK
HIS
BAT
SPEED
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
VANISHED
CONSERVATIVELY
ID
SAY
HES
LOST
OF
HIS
BAT
SPEED
AND
THATS
A
HUGE
AMOUNT
OF
SPEED
THAT
OPEN
STANCE
IS
KILLING
HIM
NOTE
THAT
HE
ACTS
SORT
OF
LIKE
BRIAN
DOWNING
WAY
OPEN
TO
START
THEN
CLOSES
UP
AS
BALL
IS
RELEASED
DOWNING
COULD
DO
THIS
WITHOUT
SIGNIFICANT
HEAD
MOVEMENT
CANSECO
CANT
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
CANSECO
DOESNT
ALWAYS
CLOSE
HIS
STANCE
THE
SAME
WAY
SOMETIMES
HIS
HIPS
ARE
OPEN
SOMETIMES
THEYRE
FULLY
CLOSED
WITHOUT
A
GOOD
STARTING
POINT
ITS
HARD
TO
MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS
IN
YOUR
SWING
WHAT
WOULD
I
DO
IF
I
WERE
JOSE
ASIDE
FROM
SALTING
AWAY
A
LARGE
SUM
OF
A
CASH
THAT
I
COULD
NEVER
TOUCH
SO
THAT
ID
NEVER
HAVE
TO
WORK
AGAIN
ID
RESTRUCTURE
MY
ENTIRE
SWING
FIRST
MINIMIZE
MOVEMENT
BEFORE
THE
SWING
CLOSE
AND
WIDEN
THE
STANCE
AND
SEVERELY
CUT
DOWN
THE
STRIDE
I
TAKE
ON
MY
SWING
HOPEFULLY
THIS
WILL
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
TIME
I
NEED
TO
SWING
AND
WILL
ALLOW
ME
TO
MOVE
THE
BATHEAD
MORE
FREELY
SECOND
DROP
POUNDS
CUT
OUT
THE
WEIGHT
WORK
THIRD
RELAX
THE
WRISTS
WILL
COST
SOME
POWER
BUT
UNTIL
I
CAN
FIND
MY
STROKE
CONCENTRATE
ON
KEEPING
THE
BACK
SHOULDER
UP
ROLLING
THE
WRISTS
THROUGH
THE
STRIKE
ZONE
AND
HIT
LINE
DRIVES
HIS
STRENGTH
IS
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
SO
THAT
SOME
OF
THOSE
LINE
DRIVES
WILL
GET
OUT
OF
THE
PARK
IF
CANSECOS
OPEN
STANCE
AND
RESULTING
BAD
HABITS
ARE
A
RESULT
OF
HIS
BACK
PROBLEMS
HELL
BE
OUT
OF
BASEBALL
IN
THREE
YEARS
IF
NOT
HE
COULD
STILL
HIT
HR
GARY
HUCKABAY
YOU
THINK
THATS
LOUD
ENOUGH
AHOLE
MOVIE
RIGHTS
WELL
IF
YOURE
HAVING
TROUBLE
HEARING
IT
SIR
AVAILABLE
THRU
ID
BE
HAPPY
TO
TURN
IT
UP
FOR
YOU
