sandberg
is
not
particulary
known
for
his
stolen
bases
what
competition
did
alomar
have
sandberg
came
in
a
year
after
ripken
and
the
same
year
as
boggs
gwynn
and
the
other
magicians
so
less
attention
was
given
to
sandberg
alomar
is
the
only
one
in
his
class
to
be
worth
a
mediocre
besides
the
numbers
dont
count
national
league
pitchers
are
much
better
pitchers
youre
right
thomas
gonzalez
sheffield
and
griffey
dont
even
begin
to
compare
with
ripken
boggs
and
gwynn
so
no
wonder
alomar
gets
so
much
attention
sandberg
got
no
attention
his
rookie
year
because
his
rookie
year
was
terrible
so
was
his
sophomore
year
national
league
pitchers
are
much
better
pitchers
that
certainly
explains
sheffields
hm
are
you
confusing
have
eras
that
are
lower
because
they
dont
face
dhs
with
much
better
ted
frank
however
teel
should
have
mentioned
that
though
his
advice
is
legally
sound
if
you
follow
it
the
u
of
c
law
school
you
will
probably
wind
up
in
jail
