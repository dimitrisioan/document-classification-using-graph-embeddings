ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
BTW
BY
MY
DEFINITIONS
THE
BEST
PLAYER
IS
THE
ONE
WHO
DOES
THE
MOST
THINGS
TO
HELP
HIS
TEAM
WIN
I
WILL
ALLOW
THAT
THIS
COULD
VARY
DEPENDING
ON
WHO
ELSE
IS
ON
THE
TEAM
BY
HAVING
APTITUDES
ONE
TEAM
NEEDS
MORE
THAN
OTHERS
WELL
THEN
GIVEN
YOUR
DEFINITION
OF
BEST
IS
IT
NOT
CONCEIVABLE
THAT
ALFREDO
GRIFFIN
COULD
BRING
SOMETHING
TO
A
TEAM
THAT
THAT
TEAM
NEEDS
TO
WIN
WHILE
LARKIN
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
THAT
SOMETHING
THE
TEAM
NEEDS
NO
I
DO
NOT
FIND
THIS
CONCEIVABLE
I
ALSO
CANNOT
CONCEIVE
OF
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THERE
IS
ANY
HYPOTHETICAL
TEAM
WHICH
MORRIS
WOULD
HELP
MORE
THAN
CLEMENS
WOULD
GRIFFIN
THEN
BE
BETTER
THAN
LARKIN
GIVEN
YOUR
PREMISE
YES
BUT
YOU
ARE
ALONE
IN
YOUR
ABILITY
TO
CONCEIVE
OF
THAT
PREMISE
VALENTINE
