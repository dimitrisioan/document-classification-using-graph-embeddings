CAN
ANYBODY
NAME
A
PLAYER
WHO
WAS
RUSHED
TO
THE
MAJORS
LETS
FOR
ARGUMENTS
SAKE
DEFINE
RUSHED
AS
BROUGHT
UP
TO
THE
MAJORS
FOR
MORE
THAN
A
CUP
OF
COFFEE
PRIOR
AT
AGE
OR
YOUNGER
AND
PERFORMING
BELOW
EXPECTATIONS
WHOSE
CAREER
WAS
DAMAGED
BY
THIS
RUSHING
I
TEND
TO
AGREE
THAT
PLAYERS
ARE
NOT
HURT
BY
EARLY
PLAY
IN
THE
BIG
LEAGUES
THE
BRAVES
ORGANIZATION
IS
A
FERTILE
GROUND
TO
TEST
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
AS
THEY
HAD
LITTLE
TALENT
ON
THEIR
ROSTER
FOR
SOME
TIME
STEVE
AVERY
FOR
EXAMPLE
WAS
RUSHED
TO
THE
MAJORS
AND
HE
FARED
VERY
POORLY
DURING
HIS
INITIAL
CAMPAIGN
HIS
SUBSEQUENT
PITCHING
HAS
NOT
BEEN
AFFECTED
BY
HIS
ERA
DURING
HIS
ROOKIE
YEAR
BILL
JAMES
POINTED
OUT
THAT
IT
WAS
RELATIVELY
UNUSUAL
TO
STRUGGLE
SO
AND
THEN
REBOUND
BOB
HORNER
WAS
ALSO
RUSHED
TO
THE
MAJORS
OUT
OF
ARIZONA
STATE
DIRECTLY
HAD
GOOD
NUMBERS
IMMEDIATELY
I
AM
NOT
CERTAIN
OF
THE
AGES
OF
PEOPLE
LIKE
PETE
SMITH
CRAIG
MCMURTY
AND
DEREK
LILLIQUIST
THE
BRAVES
PITCHING
STAFFS
WERE
SO
BAD
WHEN
THEY
CAME
UP
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
RUSHED
LILLIQUIST
AND
SMITH
STRUGGLED
BUT
IT
DIDNT
HURT
PS
AND
DL
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
OVERHYPED
I
SEEM
TO
