THE
SOX
ARE
THE
ONLY
UNDEFEATED
TEAM
IN
THE
AL
EAST
AFTER
DAYS
GO
JUMP
IN
THE
LAKE
YOU
NONBELIEVERS
STEVE
AS
I
HAVE
READ
THIS
NET
THE
LAST
FEW
DAYS
I
AM
CONTINUALLY
AMAZED
AT
THE
PRONOUNCEMENTS
OF
BASEBALL
PROWESS
BY
MANY
INDIVIDUALS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
IT
COMES
DOWN
TO
SAYING
THAT
THE
BOSOX
HAVENT
A
PRAYER
AS
A
LONG
TIME
RED
SOX
FAN
I
WILL
SIMPLY
SAY
THE
IMPOSSIBLE
DREAM
YEAR
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WITH
SHORT
MEMORIES
SHORT
LIVES
OR
BOTH
TO
BE
A
RED
SOX
FAN
IS
TO
CONTINUALLY
BE
THE
SUBJECT
OF
ABUSE
AND
CRITICISM
FROM
THOSE
WHO
ONLY
FOLLOW
THE
HOT
TEAM
THIS
STATEMENT
IS
SUPPORTED
BASED
ON
THE
INCREASED
NUMBER
OF
BRAVE
WOOFERS
OUT
ON
THE
NET
A
TRUE
FAN
OF
A
TEAM
ANY
TEAM
WILL
FOLLOW
THAT
TEAM
THROUGH
THE
GOOD
YEARS
AS
WELL
AS
THE
LEAN
YEARS
AND
BE
AMPLY
REWARDED
WHEN
THE
TIME
IS
RIGHT
YEAH
SO
WHAT
IF
BUCKNER
LET
A
ROLLER
GO
THROUGH
HIS
LEGS
IN
WHO
CARES
IF
CLEMENS
TOLD
COOLEY
TO
GO
PISS
UP
A
ROPE
AND
PROMPTLY
EARNED
A
QUICK
SHOWER
THE
FACT
IS
THEY
WERE
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
TEAMS
IN
THE
LEAGUE
THOSE
YEARS
AND
THE
FANS
SUPPORTED
THEM
NOW
THAT
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THEY
ARE
ON
LEAN
TIMES
THE
NUMBER
OF
DETRACTERS
COME
FROM
ALL
OVER
SO
WHAT
LET
THEM
PLAY
AND
WE
WILL
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
COME
SEPTEMBER
THE
RED
SOX
MAY
NOT
BE
THAT
GOOD
BUT
THEY
ARE
CERTAINLY
NOT
THAT
BAD
EITHER
AND
THEY
DO
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
WIN
THE
WORLD
SERIES
AFTER
ALL
REMEMBER
THE
METS
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
GIVEN
THEM
A
CHANCE
TO
EVEN
MAKE
IT
THAT
FAR
LET
ALONE
BEAT
BALTIMORE
LETS
FACE
IT
BASEBALL
IS
A
WONDERFUL
GAME
AND
IS
FAR
MORE
UNPREDICTABLE
THAN
FOOTBALL
AND
BASKETBALL
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
ONE
CAN
NEVER
SAY
WITH
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINITY
WHAT
THE
OUTCOME
WILL
BE
OVER
