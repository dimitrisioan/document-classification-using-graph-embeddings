record
hell
the
orioles
opening

game
could
easily
be
the
largest
in

for
the
entire

is
moving
fast
bleacher
seats
are
almost
gone
for
every

this
year
its
a
extremely
likelyhood
that
the

could
sell
out
every
game
this
year
especially
if
we
lead
the
division
for
most
of
the
year
like
on
another
front
the
sale
of
the
orioles
to
anyone
is
likely
to
be
forced
upon
eli
jacobs
who
is
major
debt
apparently
maybe
we
can
get
an
owner
willing
to
spend
on
a
