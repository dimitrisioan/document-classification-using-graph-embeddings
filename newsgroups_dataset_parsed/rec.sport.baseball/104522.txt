heres
my
analysis
of
jose
canseco
circa
sep
and
jose
canseco
circa
june
hes
bulked
up
too
much
period
he
needs
to
lose
about
pounds
not
gain
more
bulk
ive
been
saying
that
for
at
least
years
now
and
even
the
as
conditioning
guru
told
jose
he
was
carrying
too
much
weight
and
losing
some
would
help
his
backalthough
i
dont
for
one
second
believe
jose
used
steroidshis
back
problems
are
very
similar
to
problems
alot
of
steroid
users
experience
because
they
are
simply
carrying
too
much
weight
on
their
framesee
jeff
bregel
ex
as
a
textbook
example
and
imho
jose
is
too
big
for
his
frame
his
bat
speed
has
absolutely
vanished
conservatively
id
say
hes
lost
of
his
bat
speed
and
thats
a
huge
amount
of
speed
i
cant
imagine
how
to
estimate
bat
speed
but
its
pretty
obvious
that
jose
is
missing
fastballs
he
used
to
hit
likely
due
to
his
back
that
open
stance
is
killing
him
note
that
he
acts
sort
of
like
brian
downing
way
open
to
start
then
closes
up
as
ball
is
released
downing
could
do
this
without
significant
head
movement
canseco
cant
also
note
that
canseco
doesnt
always
close
his
stance
the
same
way
sometimes
his
hips
are
open
sometimes
theyre
fully
closed
without
a
good
starting
point
its
hard
to
make
adjustments
in
your
swing
i
dont
know
he
had
an
even
more
open
stance
when
he
first
came
up
with
the
as
and
had
no
problems
with
it
then
it
might
be
that
preback
problems
he
was
quick
enough
to
cover
up
any
deficiencies
the
stance
caused
but
now
hes
lost
just
enough
bat
speed
that
the
stance
hurts
him
the
old
saying
if
youre
hot
its
a
trigger
mechanism
if
youre
cold
its
a
hitch
first
minimize
movement
before
the
swing
close
and
widen
the
stance
and
severely
cut
down
the
stride
i
take
on
my
swing
hopefully
this
will
cut
down
on
the
time
i
need
to
swing
and
will
allow
me
to
move
the
bathead
more
freely
the
biggest
problem
imho
is
he
never
has
found
a
stance
hes
comfortable
with
for
more
than
a
few
months
he
changes
his
stance
so
much
he
loses
track
of
where
the
strike
zone
is
in
wednesdays
night
game
he
was
clearly
mad
at
strike
calls
on
both
corners
that
looked
pretty
good
to
me
i
think
he
no
longer
knows
where
the
strike
zone
really
is
because
hes
changed
his
stance
so
much
im
also
a
bit
concerned
that
because
hes
got
palmer
and
gonzalez
hitting
all
the
homeruns
hell
become
competitive
swing
even
harder
and
screw
himself
up
even
worse
larussa
always
said
that
cansecos
famous
batting
practice
homer
shows
did
him
more
harm
than
good
as
they
encouraged
bad
hitting
habits
