RON
GRAHAM
WRITES
I
HESITATE
TO
MAKE
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHEN
THEY
WRITE
BUT
NEITHER
OF
YOU
TWO
SOUND
AS
THOUGH
YOU
HAVE
KIDS
AND
YOU
MAY
NOT
HAVE
SPOUSES
EITHER
I
WONDER
WHY
YOU
SAY
THAT
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
HAVING
A
SPOUSE
ANDOR
KIDS
WOULD
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
IT
MIGHT
IF
YOU
BROUGHT
YOUR
KIDS
TO
THE
GAME
AND
WANTED
THEM
TO
GET
HOME
IN
TIME
TO
GET
TO
BED
AT
A
REASONABLE
HOUR
IN
WHICH
CASE
ID
PROBABLY
DECIDE
TO
TAKE
MY
KIDS
TO
GAMES
ON
WEEKENDS
AS
MANY
PEOPLE
DO
OR
ELSE
BE
PREPARED
TO
LEAVE
THE
GAME
EARLY
BUT
FROM
WHAT
YOU
SAY
LATER
ON
YOU
DONT
BRING
YOUR
KIDS
OR
YOUR
SPOUSE
TO
THE
GAME
AS
IT
HAPPENS
I
HAVE
A
HUSBAND
BUT
NO
KIDS
AND
MY
HUSBAND
USUALLY
ATTENDS
GAMES
WITH
ME
EXTRA
INNINGS
COULD
PUT
ME
WELL
PAST
MIDNIGHT
EVEN
WITHOUT
EXTRA
INNINGS
IF
THE
SCORE
IS
BEYOND
I
CANT
SEE
MY
FAMILY
THAT
NIGHT
AT
ALL
IF
THE
NEXT
DAY
IS
A
WORKDAY
I
MAY
HAVE
TO
BAG
THAT
AS
WELL
I
CAN
SEE
ITS
A
PROBLEM
IF
YOU
DONT
BRING
YOUR
WIFE
TO
THE
BALLGAME
BUT
THATS
A
PROBLEM
EVEN
IF
THE
GAME
GOES
A
TRIM
HOURS
AS
FAR
AS
BAGGING
WORK
THE
NEXT
DAY
I
DONT
REALLY
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THATS
NECESSARY
UNLESS
GOING
TO
A
GAME
ALSO
MEANS
THAT
YOU
CONSUME
VAST
QUANTITIES
OF
BEER
I
NOTE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
FOR
MANY
GUYS
IF
YOU
DONT
THINK
YOU
CAN
GET
UP
TO
GO
TO
WORK
AFTER
A
LONG
EVENING
OUT
THEN
DONT
HAVE
LONG
EVENINGS
OUT
DURING
THE
WEEK
ALL
THAT
STUFF
ENTERS
INTO
MY
CONSIDERATION
OF
EVEN
GOING
TO
A
GAME
IF
YOU
SAY
YOU
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
GAME
IS
SPED
UP
IMPO
YOU
ARE
SAYING
YOU
DONT
CARE
WHERE
THE
TIME
GOES
AND
THAT
THE
GAME
IS
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
HAVE
FAMILIES
AND
DONT
HAVE
TO
GET
UP
FOR
WORK
THE
NEXT
DAY
LOOK
IF
I
PAY
BETWEEN
AND
APIECE
FOR
TICKETS
PLUS
FOR
PARKING
PLUS
SPENDING
MY
TIME
AND
ENERGY
DRIVING
TO
AND
FROM
BOSTON
PLUS
SPENDING
ADDITIONAL
MONEY
ON
CONCESSIONS
ETC
AT
THE
BALLPARK
THEN
I
SEE
GOING
TO
A
GAME
AS
A
CONSIDERABLE
INVESTMENT
OF
TIME
AND
MONEY
I
CANT
AFFORD
TO
GO
TO
A
LOT
OF
GAMES
HENCE
GOING
TO
A
GAME
IS
A
BIG
DEAL
LIKE
GOING
TO
A
PLAY
OR
AN
OPERA
MAYBE
YOU
HAVE
MORE
MONEY
THAN
I
DO
AND
CAN
GO
TO
GAMES
ALL
YEAR
LONG
SO
ITS
NOT
SUCH
A
BIG
DEAL
FOR
YOU
BUT
IM
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
HAVING
GAMES
SPED
UP
ANY
MORE
THAN
I
WANT
TO
HAVE
DIE
WALKURE
CUT
DOWN
TO
A
CONVENIENT
WEEKNIGHT
VERSION
OF
TWO
HOURS
IF
I
FELT
THAT
GOING
TO
A
NIGHT
GAME
DURING
THE
WEEK
WOULD
INTERFERE
WITH
MY
FAMILY
LIFE
OR
MY
WORK
LIFE
THEN
ID
CHOOSE
TO
GO
TO
A
WEEKEND
GAME
IMPO
HEATHER
