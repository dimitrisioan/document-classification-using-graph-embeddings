or
second
starter
it
seems
to
me
that
when
quality
pitchers
take
the
mound
the
other
teams
score
less
runs
the
team
that
scores
the
most
runs
wins
this
puts
the
team
with
the
better
pitching
at
the
advantage
providing
they
can
stop
the
opposing
team
from
scoring
runs
a
low
scoring
game
would
clearly
benefit
the
braves
not
clear
to
me
at
all
id
certainly
rather
have
a
team
who
was
winning
games
than
games
in
the
game
luck
is
going
to
play
a
much
bigger
role
than
in
the
game
