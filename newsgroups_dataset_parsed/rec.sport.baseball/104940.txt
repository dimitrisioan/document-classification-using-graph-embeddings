I
THINK
SAC
FLIES
ARE
THE
ONLY
WAY
OBP
CAN
BE
BELOW
BA
DOES
THIS
SEEM
DUMB
TO
ANYONE
ELSE
THE
FACT
NOT
THE
COMMENT
WHY
SHOULD
A
BATTERS
OBP
BE
HURT
BY
A
SAC
FLY
ESPECIALLY
IF
SAC
BUNTS
DONT
HAVE
THE
SAME
EFFECT
SINCE
THEY
DO
THE
SAME
THING
BUT
SAC
FLIES
USUALLY
SCORE
A
RUN
WHILE
BUNTS
JUST
ADVANCE
A
BASE
BUT
BOTH
OF
THESE
SITUATIONS
INVOLVE
THE
BATTER
GIVING
UP
AN
AB
FOR
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
TEAM
SACRIFICE
SO
WHY
SHOULD
IT
HURT
THEIR
STATS
THE
SAC
BUNT
IS
A
PURPOSEFUL
ACT
ORDERED
BY
THE
MANAGER
THE
BATTER
DOES
NOT
GO
UP
TRYING
TO
GET
A
SAC
FLY
AND
THE
EVIDENCE
AVAILABLE
INDICATES
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
ABILITY
PLAYERS
CANT
WILL
THEMSELVES
TO
HIT
SAC
FLIES
THEY
FLY
OUT
TO
THE
SAME
PLACE
JUST
AS
OFTEN
WHEN
THERES
NOBODY
ON
THIRD
GREG
SORRY
I
GOTTA
DISAGREE
HERE
LAST
TIME
I
PLAYED
BALL
I
WENT
UP
ON
SEVERAL
OCCASIONS
INTENDING
TO
HIT
A
FLY
BALL
DEEP
ENOUGH
TO
SCORE
THE
RUNNER
FROM
THIRD
OR
ADVANCE
A
RUNNER
TO
THIRD
ITS
RELATIVELY
EASY
ACTUALLY
YOU
SWING
UNDER
THE
PATH
OF
THE
BALL
YOU
NORMALLY
WOULD
TO
HIT
A
GOOD
LINE
DRIVE
WITH
FASTBALLS
ITS
VERY
EASY
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
WITH
GOOD
BREAKING
BALLS
A
GOOD
HITTER
WITH
EXCELLENT
BAT
CONTROL
CAN
VOLUNTARILY
HIT
FLY
BALLS
TO
THE
OUTFIELD
AT
LEAST
OH
OF
THE
TIME
YOU
HAVENT
BEEN
FACING
MAJOR
LEAGUE
PITCHING
MAYBE
MORE
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
GOOD
AT
THE
PLATE
AND
MOST
OF
THOSE
GUYS
ARE
JUST
AS
LIKELY
TO
OPT
FOR
GETTING
THE
BASE
HIT
AND
HELPING
THEIR
AVERAGE
AS
GETTING
THE
SACRIFICE
THE
BEST
EXAMPLE
I
KNOW
OF
IS
JERRY
WILLARD
IN
THE
SERIES
AGAINST
MINNESOTA
ALL
HE
HAD
TO
DO
WAS
PUT
ONE
IN
THE
OF
AND
THE
GAME
WAS
OVER
HE
SWUNG
WAAAAAAY
PAST
PARALLEL
AND
ACCOMPLISHED
BARELY
GETTING
THE
RUN
IN
SAFELY
STATS
DID
A
LITTLE
STUDY
IN
THE
SCOREBOARD
BOOK
ENTITLED
CAN
YOU
HIT
SACRIFICE
FLIES
ON
PURPOSE
A
SUMMARY
OF
THE
FINDINGS
OVER
THE
YEAR
PERIOD
SACFLY
TYPE
FLY
BALLS
WERE
PRODUCED
PERCENT
OF
THE
TIME
IN
SITUATIONS
WHERE
A
SAC
FLY
WAS
USEFUL
AND
PERCENT
OF
THE
TIME
WHEN
A
SAC
FLY
WASNT
USEFUL
THEY
LOOKED
AT
THE
LEADERS
IN
SAC
FLIES
AND
FOUND
THAT
THE
LEADERS
IN
SAC
FLIES
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THE
GUYS
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
TO
BE
GOOD
AT
IT
IT
HIT
SAC
FLY
TYPE
FLY
BALLS
ONLY
MORE
OFTEN
WHEN
THEY
NEEDED
TO
A
DIFFERENCE
WAY
TOO
SMALL
TO
BE
THE
RESULT
OF
A
SKILL
ESSENTIALLY
THE
PLAYERS
WHO
HIT
A
LOT
OF
SAC
FLIES
SEEM
TO
DO
SO
BECAUSE
THEY
HIT
HIT
SAC
FLY
TYPE
FLIES
OFTEN
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
A
RUNNER
ON
THIRD
STATS
CONCLUDES
SO
IT
APPEARS
CONCLUSIVE
THAT
HITTERS
CANNOT
HIT
SACRIFICE
FLIES
ON
PURPOSE
EVEN
IF
THEY
PRACTICE
IN
THE
BATTING
CAGE
