i
agree
with
nick
whats
the
big
deal
about
long
games
if
you
want
to
watch
baseball
theres
that
much
more
baseball
to
watch
and
yes
baseball
includes
the
space
between
plays
as
well
as
the
plays
themselves
i
dont
really
mind
the
length
of
games
either
if
they
want
to
speed
the
games
up
in
sensible
ways
thats
fine
with
me
too
however
what
i
object
to
is
the
assertion
by
baseball
people
whitey
herzog
buck
rodgers
are
who
ive
heard
say
this
that
games
are
too
long
because
hitters
are
taking
too
many
pitches
and
that
the
strike
zone
needs
to
be
expanded
