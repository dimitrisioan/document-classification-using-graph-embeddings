DAVID

TATE
WRITES
MSSNETCOMCOM
MARK
SINGER
SAID
I
MEANT
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
LET
THE
EXCEPTION
MAKE
THE
RULE
ITS
NOT
AN
EXCEPTION
GOOD
PLAYERS
COME
UP
YOUNG
MOST
PLAYERS
WHO
COME
UP
YOUNG
WILL
BE
GOOD
THIS
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THE
RULE
ARE
MOST
PLAYERS
WHO
COME
UP
YOUNG
ALWAYS
GOOD
WHEN
THEYRE
YOUNG
OR
LATER
WORSE
ITS
NOT
A
SHIFT
THIS
IS
THE
WAY
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
SEVERAL
DETAILED
STUDIES
OF
THIS
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
AND
THEYVE
ALL
SHOWN
THAT
PLAYERS
ARENT
COMING
UP
ANY
YOUNGER
OR
OLDER
THAN
IN
THE
PAST
AND
THEY
ARENT
PLAYING
ANY
MORE
OR
LESS
IN
THE
MINORS
THAN
THEY
USED
TO
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
SHIFTS
IS
OUR
MEMORIES
OF
THE
GOOD
OLD
DAYS
DAMN
I
WAS
AFRAID
YOU
WOULD
SAY
THAT
BUT
ALL
AFTER
THE
FACT
WHICH
MAKES
IT
NOT
APPLICABLE
TO
THE
CURRENT
DISCUSSION
WHICH
IS
ABOUT
HOW
YOU
DECIDE
WHETHER
TO
PLAY
THE
ROOKIE
WHO
HASNT
ESTABLISHED
HIMSELF
IN
THE
MAJORS
OVER
THE
MEDIOCRE
VETERAN
THE
PADRES
PLAYED
SANTIAGO
THAT
YEAR
BECAUSE
THEY
CLEARLY
HAD
NOBODY
ELSE
WORTH
PLAYING
WELL
PERHAPS
IF
THE
BRAVES
HAD
NO
ONE
ELSE
WORTH
PLAYING
THIS
YEAR
IT
WOULD
BE
LOPEZ
IN
THERE
BUT
THEY
DO
HAVE
OTHERS
WORTH
PLAYING
AT
LEAST
IN
THEIR
OPINION
AND
I
HAPPEN
TO
AGREE
BOTH
OF
THESE
YOUNG
MEN
WERE
HIGHLY
TOUTED
DEFENSIVE
CATCHERS
EXPECTED
TO
BE
AMONG
THE
BEST
EVER
IN
BASEBALL
NOT
BY
RECSPORTBASEBALL
CONSENSUS
THAT
MAY
SOUND
LIKE
AN
INCREDIBLY
ARROGANT
COMMENT
BUT
IVE
FOUND
THAT
THE
SDCN
CONSENSUS
WHEN
ONE
EXISTS
IS
RIGHT
FAR
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
THE
MEDIA
CONSENSUS
OR
THE
OPINIONS
OF
BASEBALL
PEOPLE
AFFILIATED
WITH
MLB
I
CAN
BELIEVE
THAT
IM
A
NEWBIE
HERE
SO
ILL
TAKE
YOUR
WORD
BUT
ALOMAR
IS
A
FINE
DEFENSIVE
CATCHER
WHICH
WAS
MY
STATEMENT
ABOVE
THAT
IS
A
SOLID
REASON
FOR
BRINGING
HIM
UP
AT
A
TENDER
AGE
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
FEEL
HE
CAN
ALSO
HIT
A
BIT
LOPEZ
DOES
NOT
HAVE
SUCH
A
CONSENSUS
ABOUT
HIS
DEFENSIVE
PROWESS
AND
IMHO
THAT
IS
ENOUGH
TO
GIVE
HIM
THAT
DREADED
SEASONING
I
DONT
KNOW
WHO
KNOWS
I
SUPPOSE
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
OR
SIMILAR
WHO
KNOW
HE
WILL
BE
BETTER
THAN
SOME
OTHER
CATCHER
THESE
ARE
OF
COURSE
JUST
DIFFERING
OPINIONS
I
READ
THAT
HIS
ARM
IS
NOT
THAT
STRONG
I
SUPPOSE
SOMEWHERE
THERE
IS
SOME
MEASUREMENT
OF
SB
RATIOS
AND
THAT
HE
IS
STILL
LEARNING
TO
CALL
A
GAME
THAT
LATTER
SKILL
MAY
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
PROJECT
ON
SOMEONE
WITHOUT
AN
INTIMATE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
HIS
PERFORMANCE
BUT
IT
IS
A
TANGIBLE
SKILL
I
DISAGREE
IN
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
A
TANGIBLE
SKILL
ANY
MORE
THAN
LEADERSHIP
IS
I
DONT
DENY
THAT
IT
IS
A
REAL
SKILL
AND
THAT
SOME
CATCHERS
MAY
BE
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
OTHERS
AT
IT
BUT
I
REALLY
DONT
SEE
ANY
WAY
THAT
WE
COULD
EVER
KNOW
WHO
THEY
ARE
NICHOLSS
LAW
OF
CATCHER
DEFENSE
IS
EERILY
ACCURATE
FAR
TOO
OFTEN
FOR
ME
TO
TAKE
DEFENSIVE
ASSESSMENTS
OF
CATCHERS
VERY
SERIOUSLY
SORRY
NEW
DONT
KNOW
NICHOLS
LAW
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
CATCHERS
ERA
BUT
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
PITCHERS
ERAS
WITH
DIFFERENT
CATCHERS
ANY
INFO
ON
THAT
ABSOLUTELY
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
PILING
UP
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR
THE
ONLY
OTHER
ALTERNATIVE
IS
THAT
THE
BRAVES
REALLY
DONT
KNOW
THAT
THEIR
YOUNG
PLAYERS
ARE
ON
AVERAGE
BETTER
THAN
THEIR
CURRENT
STARTERS
IM
NOT
RULING
OUT
THAT
KIND
OF
GROSS
INCOMPETENCE
BUT
I
THINK
THE
SALARYSCHEDULE
EXPLANATION
IS
MORE
CHARITABLE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WE
KNOW
MORE
THAN
THEY
DO
SO
THE
ONLY
LOGIC
BEHIND
A
DIFFERENT
DECISION
THAN
WE
WOULD
MAKE
MUST
BE
FINANCIAL
I
PRESUME
WE
FEEL
THIS
WAY
ABOUT
OTHER
FRANCHISES
THAN
ATLANTA
NO
CONSIDER
WE
KNOW
THAT
THE
BRAVES
ARE
ABOUT
THE
STRONGEST
TEAM
IN
BASEBALL
RIGHT
NOW
EVEN
WITH
OLSON
AND
LEMKE
AND
NIXON
AND
BREAM
IN
THE
LINEUP
THEY
HAVE
AS
GOOD
A
CHANCE
OF
REPEATING
AS
CHAMPS
THIS
YEAR
AS
ANY
TEAM
EVER
HAS
IT
ACTUALLY
MAKES
SOME
SENSE
TO
SAY
RATHER
THAN
MAKING
OUR
TEAM
MARGINALLY
BETTER
THIS
YEAR
BY
BRINGING
UP
THE
YOUNG
STUDS
AND
DUMPING
THE
ELDERLY
LETS
GO
AHEAD
AND
COMPETE
THIS
YEAR
WITH
WHAT
WE
HAVE
AND
THEN
BRING
UP
THE
STUDS
ONLY
AS
WE
HAVE
TO
SO
THAT
WELL
STILL
HAVE
THEM
UNDER
RESERVE
THREE
YEARS
FROM
NOW
AND
BEYOND
WHEN
THE
CURRENT
TEAM
WILL
BE
COLLECTING
PENSIONS
IS
IT
FAIR
TO
THE
YOUNG
PLAYERS
NO
DOES
IT
MAKE
ORGANIZATIONAL
SENSE
I
THINK
IT
DOES
WELL
IF
IT
DOES
MAKE
ORGANIZATIONAL
SENSE
ONE
CAN
HARDLY
FAULT
THEM
FOR
THEIR
DECISIONS
I
MEAN
PLEASE
DONT
TELL
ME
HOW
TO
RUN
MY
BUSINESS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
IM
BEING
SUCCESSFUL
C
I
COULD
MAKE
IT
OR
WINS
IF
YOU
LET
ME
BRING
UP
LOPEZ
S
LISTEN
BOBBY
ID
LIKE
TO
BUT
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
IF
HE
HITS
THE
BIG
CLUB
THIS
YEAR
WELL
BE
PAYING
MEGAARBITRATION
BUCKS
DOWN
THE
ROAD
IN
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AND
THERES
NO
WAY
I
WANT
TO
DO
THAT
AND
CONTINUES
WITH
WE
CAN
WIN
WITHOUT
HIM
AND
THEN
KEEP
WINNING
NEXT
YEAR
WITH
HIM
HOWS
THAT
IM
SURE
YOU
COULD
BE
RIGHT
YOU
COULD
ALSO
BE
SMOKING
SOME
ILLEGAL
SUBSTANCE
HEY
THATS
A
JOKE
DONT
GET
OFFENDED
PLEASE
HEY
ID
LOVE
TO
BE
WRONG
ABOUT
THIS
IF
YOU
THINK
ITS
UNLIKELY
ID
LOVE
TO
KNOW
WHY
DONT
CITE
ANYBODYS
INNATE
ETHICAL
RECTITUDE
THOUGH
UNLESS
YOU
KNOW
THEM
PERSONALLY
WELL
I
CANT
CITE
ANYONES
ETHICAL
RECTITUDE
BECAUSE
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
MEANS
BUT
AGAIN
IF
IT
MAKES
ORGANIZATIONAL
SENSE
THEN
SO
BE
IT
BASEBALL
IS
A
BUSINESS
AND
IF
THERE
IS
A
SOLID
BUSINESS
REASON
FOR
KEEPING
LOPEZ
ON
THE
FARM
THEN
THATS
WHAT
THE
BRAVES
SHOULD
DO
I
HAPPEN
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ITS
A
BASEBALL
DECISION
WHILE
YOU
FROM
YOUR
ARMCHAIR
MAY
DISAGEE
I
DONT
I
THINK
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
EVIDENCE
TO
SUGGEST
THE
DECISION
THEY
MADE
I
PREDICTED
IT
AMONG
LARGE
GUFFAWS
FROM
SEVERAL
AT
THE
START
OF
SPRING
TRAINING
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
VERY
NORMAL
DECISION
TO
HAVE
MADE
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
MORE
REVERSIBLE
THAN
TO
HAVE
STARTED
LOPEZ
IN
THE
BIGS
AND
HAVE
RELEASED
ONE
OF
THEIR
CATCHERS
SURE
IT
MAY
BE
CONSERVATIVE
IT
MAY
ALSO
BE
LOGICAL
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
ETHICS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
PRETTY
GOOD
COMMON
SENSE

ME
