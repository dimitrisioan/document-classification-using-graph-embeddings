does
anybody
know
what
is
going
on
with
lankford
i
know
he
was
out
for
a
few
games
with
a
slight
injury
but
since
he
has
beenback
and
before
the
injury
for
that
matter
he
has
been
really
struggling
at
the
plate
and
on
the
basepaths
his
performance
at
the
plate
may
well
be
from
the
shoulder
injury
received
when
he
ran
into
the
wall
making
a
catch
in
the
cincy
series
it
may
also
be
him
pressing
a
little
as
for
the
baserunning
it
does
not
appear
to
be
just
lankford
dent
made
the
bad
call
sending
lankford
in
the
sunday
night
game
against
cincy
but
everyone
had
a
bad
time
against
the
dodgers
catcher
whereis
the
ray
lankford
we
saw
last
year
good
question
at
least
it
doesnt
appear
that
we
are
seeing
the
same
