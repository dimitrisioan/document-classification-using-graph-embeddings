A
TON
OF
LATE
RUNS
TO
CRUSH

IT
WAS
SIX
RUNS
IN
THE
FOR
A
WIN
MONDAY
AND
FIVE
IN
THE
AND
SIX
IN
THE
FOR
A
WIN
YESTERDAY
JAMIE
NAVARRO

STRONG
INNINGS
BUT
OROSCO
AUSTIN
MANZANILLO
AND
LLOYD
ALL
TOOK
PART
IN
THE
MOCKERY
OF
A
BULLPEN
YESTERDAY
HOWS
THIS
FOR
NUMBERS
MALDANADO
HAS
PITCHED
THREE
SCORELESS
INNINGS
AND
NAVARROS
ERA
IS
THE
NEXT
LOWEST
ON
THE
STAFF
IS
WEGMAN
AT
OUCH
IT
DOESNT
LOOK
MUCH
BETTER
FOR
THE
HITTERS
HAMILTON
IS
BATTING
WHILE
THON
IS
HITTING
AND
HAS
SEVEN
RBI
THE
NEXT
HIGHEST
IS
THREE
THE
NEXT
BEST
HITTER
IS
JAHA
AT
AND
THEN
VAUGHN
WHO
HAS
THE
TEAMS
ONLY
HR
AT
ANOTHER
OUCH
LOOKING
AT
THE
STATS
ITS
NOT
HARD
TO
SEE
WHY
THE
TEAM
IS
IN
FACT
DOESNT
SOUND
BAD
WHEN
YOURE
AVERAGING
THREE
RUNSGAME
AND
GIVING
UP
STILL
ITS
EARLY
AND
THINGS
WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY
GET
BETTER
THE
OFFENSE
SHOULD
COME
AROUND
BUT
THE
BULLPEN
IS
A
MAJOR
WORRY
FETTERS
PLESAC
AND
AUSTIN
GAVE
THE
BREWERS
GREAT
MIDDLE
RELIEF
LAST
YEAR
LLOYD
MALDANADO
MANZANILLO
FETTERS
AUSTIN
AND
OROSCO
WILL
HAVE
TO
PICK
UP
THE
PACE
FOR
THE
TEAM
TO
BE
SUCCESSFUL
MILWAUKEE
WON
A
NUMBER
OF
GAMES
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
MIDDLE
RELIEF
EITHER
HELD
SMALL
LEADS
OR
KEPT
SMALL
DEFICITS
IN
PLACE
THE
STARTERS
WILL
BE
OKAY
THE
DEFENSE
WILL
BE
ALRIGHT
AND
THE
HITTING
WILL
COME
AROUND
BUT
THE
BULLPEN
IS
A
BIG
QUESTION
MARK
IN
OTHER
NEWS
NILSSON
AND
DORAN
WERE
REACTIVATED
YESTERDAY
WHILE
WILLIAM
SUERO
WAS
SENT
DOWN
AND
TIM
MCINTOSH
