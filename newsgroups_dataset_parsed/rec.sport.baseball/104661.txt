since
time
immemorial
batters
have
complained
about
calls
so
have
pitchers
and
catchers
however
batters
didnt
use
to
go
for
strolls
after
bad
calls
to
the
degree
they
do
now
unless
the
league
notified
teams
this
year
about
not
allowing
complaints
hirschbeck
was
acting
against
expectations
everyone
was
told
of
the
new
emphasis
on
speeding
up
games
the
rule
that
hirschbeck
invoked
has
been
in
the
books
a
long
time
its
not
as
if
gant
was
in
hirschbecks
face
nobody
including
hirschbeck
ever
said
he
was
when
gant
turned
away
hirschbeck
immediately
motioned
for
gant
to
step
into
the
box
imo
at
this
point
in
time
hirschbeck
was
determined
to
show
gant
exactly
who
was
in
charge
of
this
game
gant
wasnt
dawdling
he
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
dawdle
and
hirschbeck
was
simply
exercising
a
power
play
thats
your
perhaps
colored
by
your
partisanship
of
the
braves
perception
hirschbecks
view
was
that
gant
was
heading
off
for
a
long
walk
and
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
concerning
speeding
games
up
directed
him
into
the
batters
box
gant
resisted
as
many
of
us
might
to
what
we
thought
was
an
unreasonable
request
and
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
the
point
is
based
on
the
rulebook
and
the
umpires
instructions
it
was
not
an
unreasonable
request
the
braves
were
already
upset
imo
any
game
where
you
remember
the
name
of
the
umpire
was
a
bad
game
for
the
umpire
had
gant
done
as
instructed
you
wouldnt
have
remembered
the
name
of
the
umpire
