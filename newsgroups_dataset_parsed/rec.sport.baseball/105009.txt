RE
DARRRRRRRRRYL
MARK
SINGER
BRINGS
UP
THE
STRAWBERRY
INCIDENT
WHERE
HE
LOST
A
HOMERUN
AND
THE
FAN
CAUGHT
IT
BEFORE
EACH
DODGER
GAME
THE
PUBLIC
ADDRESS
ANNOUNCER
MAKES
A
SPEECH
WHEREIN
HE
SAYS
THAT
FANS
ARE
WELCOME
TO
THE
SOUVENIRS
OF
BALLS
THAT
ARE
HIT
INTO
THE
STANDS
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
DO
NOT
INTERFERE
WITH
ANY
THAT
ARE
IN
THE
FIELD
OF
PLAY
WAS
THE
FAN
WRONG
SHOULD
HE
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
AWARE
OF
THE
SITUATION
AND
ACTED
TO
AVOID
ANY
POSSIBILITY
OF
INTERFERENCE
YES
I
THINK
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
DONE
MORE
TO
GET
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
AS
MUCH
AS
FANS
WANT
TO
CATCH
A
BALL
THEY
REALLY
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
THAT
WINNING
THE
GAME
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
AS
A
DODGER
FAN
HE
HAS
TO
BE
AWARE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
HOME
STADIUM
AND
THAT
ENTAILS
HELPING
THE
HOME
TEAM
WIN
IN
ANY
WAY
POSSIBLE
AS
SOON
AS
THE
BALL
WAS
HIT
THAT
FAR
HIS
FIRST
INSTINCT
SHOULD
BE
TO
ROOT
FOR
DARRYL
TO
CATCH
IT
NOT
TO
TRY
TO
CATCH
IT
HIMSELF
PARTICULARLY
WHEN
HE
IS
SITTING
THAT
CLOSE
I
ENJOY
THE
ATTITUDE
OF
THE
WRIGLEY
FANS
WHERE
THEY
ARE
AGAINST
VISITING
TEAM
HOME
RUNS
SO
MUCH
THEY
ACTUALLY
THROW
THEM
BACK
ON
THE
FIELD
NOW
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
WHETHER
DARRYL
COULD
HAVE
CAUGHT
IT
OR
NOT
SURE
HE
PROBABLY
SCREWED
UP
BUT
THE
FAN
SHOULD
REALIZE
HIS
FIRST
RESPONSIBILITY
IS
TO
GET
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
AND
HELP
THE
TEAM
WIN
