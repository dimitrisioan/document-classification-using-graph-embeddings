JOHN
FRANJIONE
SAYS
ALSO
I
HAVE
THE
IMPRESSION
FROM
READING
THIS
GROUP
AND
BILL
JAMES
THAT
ELIAS
IS
A
BUNCH
OF
MONEYGRUBBING
JERKS
WHOSE
MISSION
IS
TO
CHARGE
AS
MUCH
AS
THEY
CAN
FOR
BASEBALL
STATISTICAL
INFO
AND
BILL
JAMES
IS
NOT
YEAH
SURE
DO
YOU
OWN
THE
BILL
JAMES
PLAYERS
RATING
BOOK
UH
BILL
JAMES
DOESNT
SELL
STATISTICS
HE
SELLS
BOOKS
WITH
STATISTICS
BUT
HE
IS
NOT
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
PROVIDING
STATS
LIKE
ELIAS
STATS
HOWE
BASEBALL
WORKSHOP
ETC
ARE
GREG
FUNNY
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
STATS
MAJOR
LEAGUE
AND
MINOR
LEAGUE
HANDBOOKS
WHICH
ARE
NOTHING
BUT
COLLECTIONS
OF
STATISTICS
ARE
AUTHORED
BY
BILL
JAMES
AND
STATS
INC
AND
HOWE
FOR
THE
MINOR
LEAGUE
HANDBOOK
AND
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
THE
BILL
JAMES
PLAYER
RATINGS
BOOK
QUALIFIES
AS
A
BOOK
WITH
STATISTICS
WHILE
THE
ELIAS
ANALYST
IS
A
STATISTICS
BOOK
THE
ANALYST
CONTAINS
MORE
STATS
SURE
BUT
IT
ALSO
CONTAINS
MORE
DIALOGUE
FINALLY
THE
POINT
WAS
NOT
ABOUT
THE
WORD
STATISTICS
IT
WAS
ABOUT
MONEYGRUBBING
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
LOOKED
AT
THE
BILL
JAMES
PLAYER
RATINGS
BOOK
CANNOT
CONSIDER
HIM
MONEYGRUBBING
