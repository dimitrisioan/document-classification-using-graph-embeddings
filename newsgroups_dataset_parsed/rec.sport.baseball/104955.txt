mattingly
is
a
below
average
fielder
before
you
start
up
yes
i
have
proof
there
are
really
only
two
adequate
ways
to
measure
fielding
prowess
the
first
which
has
the
advantage
of
being
applicable
to
older
players
since
it
uses
raw
data
available
for
almost
all
of
mlb
history
is
the
total
chances
per
game
method
favored
by
the
total
baseball
people
among
others
it
basically
says
that
you
measure
a
fielder
by
how
many
balls
he
gets
to
but
it
is
subject
to
all
kinds
of
bias
and
is
almost
completely
useless
for
first
basemen
from
the
raw
stats
there
is
no
way
to
tell
which
of
a
first
basemans
putouts
were
made
on
throws
from
other
fielders
and
which
were
made
on
his
own
plays
likewise
you
cant
tell
whether
a
double
play
was
or
fielding
runs
thus
gives
a
first
baseman
no
credit
for
putouts
or
double
plays
only
for
assists
and
errors
it
thus
favors
first
basemen
who
play
deep
reaching
a
lot
of
balls
but
forcing
the
pitcher
to
cover
first
more
frequently
it
also
hurts
first
baseman
who
play
behind
lefthanded
pitching
staffs
and
thus
face
few
lefthanded
batters
a
better
method
but
newer
and
based
ondata
that
has
only
been
collected
over
the
last
few
years
measures
the
percentage
of
balls
hit
into
the
part
of
the
field
the
guy
is
responsible
for
this
is
better
of
course
it
still
isnt
all
of
a
first
basemans
defense
some
references

from

gimbels
baseball
player

team

defensive
average
which
uses
larger
and
probably
better
zones
has
mattingly
tied
for
second
in
the
league
on
the
other
hand
he
has
contributed
runs
by
his
batting
actions
a
pretty
healthy
number
while
batting
runs
is
good
it
is
mostly
in
the
past
the
runs
he
produced
in
dont
say
much
