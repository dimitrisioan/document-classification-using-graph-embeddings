doubles
dingers
and
rapps
even
been
sent
down
to
aaa
so
its
even
better
than
that
eh
of
course
the
protected
list
was
done
by
the
old
regime
not
the
new
so
this
is
rosens
baby
not
quinns
and
ill
tell
you
what
lets
look
at
this
again
at
the
end
of
the
season
and
say
in
three
years
and
see
who
the
genius
is
one
of
the
more
braindead
decisions
by
the
oldgiants
imho
even
if
benjamin
does
improve
markedly
over
the
past
and
his
hitting
is
better
hes
never
going
to
be
more
than
a
utilitybackup
if
rapp
might
turn
into
a
topflight
arm
in
another
year
i
think
the
next
time
i
post
something
like
this
i
obviously
need
to
make
the
sarcasm
a
bit
more
obvious
