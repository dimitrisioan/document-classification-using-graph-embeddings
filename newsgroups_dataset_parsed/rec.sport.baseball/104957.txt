DAVID
GRABINER
IN
ARTICLE
TIM
SHIPPERT
WRITES
IDEALLY
DHS
SHOULD
BE
THE
STRONGEST
OFFENSIVE
PLAYERS
BECAUSE
ANY
SCHMOE
CAN
PLAY
DH
IF
HE
CAN
HIT
THAT
WOULD
TAKE
CARE
OF
POSITION
CORRECTED
ANOMOLIES
SUCH
AS
FRANKS
SINCE
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
AND
WHY
NOT
IS
IT
ALWAYS
THIS
WAY
THEN
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
TROUBLE
FINDING
THE
TRUE
VALUE
OF
DHS
USING
THE
SAME
MODELS
AS
THAT
FOR
POSITION
PLAYERS
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
REASONS
FOR
THIS
DIFFERENCE
THE
MAIN
REASON
IS
THAT
GOOD
HITTERS
IN
THEIR
PRIME
SUCH
AS
FRANK
THOMAS
AND
DANNY
TARTABULL
ARE
RARELY
REGULAR
DHS
EVEN
IF
THEY
CANT
FIELD
ITS
MORE
COMMONLY
A
PLACE
TO
PUT
AGING
VETERANS
ANOTHER
USE
OF
THE
DH
SLOT
IS
TO
HELP
A
PLAYER
COME
BACK
FROM
INJURY
SLOWLY
GETTING
HIS
BAT
IN
THE
LINEUP
WITHOUT
FORCING
HIM
TO
PLAY
IN
THE
FIELD
I
WOULD
EXPECT
SUCH
PLAYERS
TO
HIT
WORSE
AS
DHS
THAN
THEY
DID
DURING
THE
REST
OF
THE
SEASON
A
THIRD
FACTOR
IS
THAT
MOST
PLAYER
WHO
SPLIT
TIME
BETWEEN
DH
AND
FIRST
OR
THE
OUTFIELD
DONT
HIT
AS
WELL
AS
DHS
FOR
SOME
REASON
REGGIE
JACKSON
WAS
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
IN
FIVE
YEARS
AS
A
RFDH
FOR
THE
ANGELS
HE
HIT
LIKE
THE
OLD
REGGIE
WHEN
HE
WAS
IN
RIGHT
THE
SECOND
AND
THIRD
FACTORS
WILL
BE
LOST
IF
PLAYERS
ARE
CONSIDERED
BY
THEIR
PRIMARY
POSITION
ONLY
A
PLAYER
WHO
PLAYS
GAMES
IN
RIGHT
AND
AT
DH
WILL
COUNT
ONLY
IN
THE
RIGHT
FIELDERS
AVERAGES
A
LOGICAL
STARTING
PLACE
WOULD
BE
TO
LOOK
AT
DEFENSIVE
REPLACEMENT
VALUE
IF
YOU
CAN
FIND
IT
FOR
OR
LF
OR
SOMETHING
WE
CAN
ASSUME
THAT
IF
FORCED
TO
PLAY
DEFENSE
THEY
WOULD
PLAY
AT
TRUE
ZERO
VALUE
EVEN
THOUGH
I
DOUBT
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
TRUE
FOR
PLAYERS
LIKE
WINFIELD
AND
MOLITOR
THIS
WOULD
LET
US
DISCOUNT
THE
TIME
THEY
SPEND
PLAYING
DH
BECAUSE
THAT
FORCES
THE
TEAM
TO
FIND
ANOTHER
REAL
FIELDER
TO
PLAY
THIS
MAKES
SENSE
YOU
MIGHT
ALSO
LOOK
AT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
ALTHOUGH
THE
AVERAGE
OFFENSIVE
PERFORMANCE
OF
A
DH
MAY
BE
LOWER
THAN
FOR
A
LEFT
FIELDER
THE
REPLACEMENTLEVEL
OFFENSIVE
PERFORMANCE
IS
CERTAINLY
LOWER
IF
YOU
ARE
A
LEFT
FIELDER
BUT
CANT
HIT
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
KEEP
A
JOB
ANYWHERE
THEN
YOU
CERTAINLY
CANT
HIT
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
KEEP
A
JOB
AT
DH
