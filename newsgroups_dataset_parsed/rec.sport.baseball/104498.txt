so

it
looks

a

be
squeezing
the
strike

watching
the
braves
on
tbs
i
would
have
said
that
the
strike
zone
in
the
nl
has
expanded
this
season
specifically
it
appears
that
the
strike
zone
has
moved
above
the
belt
yeah
the
announcers
have
commented
on
that
also
but
it
was
also
my
perception
however
the
strike
zone
hasnt
climbed
all
the
way
up
to
the
letters
its
more
like
a
little
ways
under
the
letters
any
other
perceptions
out
there
judging
by
the
way
the
reds
pitchers
have
performed
thus
far
it
appears
to
me
that
the
zone
has
been
squeezed
to
the
size
of
a
grape
