dont
you
guys
think
so
i
mean
cmon
what
the
heck
are
women
doing
even
thinking
of
getting
into
baseball
they
cause
so
many
problems
just
look
at
lisa
olson
remember
that
feisty
reporter
that
entered
the
new
england
patriots
locker
room
she
started
crying
like
a
little
girl
i
just
dont
think
women
belong
in
a
mans
sport
before
you
smart
guys
flame
me
for
this
i
know
the
given
example
was
about
football
who
cares
it
still
applies
to
other
male
sports
how
can
we
have
women
umpires
jeez
look
at
pam
postema
just
because
shes
a
woman
everybody
on
the
face
of
the
earth
thinks
its
great
that
shes
getting
an
opportunity
to
ump
if
you
even
watched
the
games
and
had
an
iq
greater
than
that
of
roast
beef
youd
see
that
she
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
most
aaa
umpires
besides
she
is
probably
more
worried
about
cracking
a
fingernail
with
a
foul
tip
off
of
wade
boggs
bat
or
jose
oquendos
bat
either
way
there
are
too
many
complications
