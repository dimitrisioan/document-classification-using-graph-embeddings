RE
THE
PHILLIES
DEJA
VU
PREVIOUSLY
I
WROTE
YEAH
THE
PHILLIES
PLAYED
OVER
THEIR
HEADS
ALMOST
THE
WHOLE
YEAR
BUT
IT
ALL
CAUGHT
UP
TO
THEM
IN
ONE
STREAK
I
AM
AS
OLD
AS
MAN
AND
I
WAS
A
BIG
PHILLIES
FAN
AT
THE
TIME
AGE
SEPTEMBER
IS
STILL
A
PAINFUL
THING
TO
REMEMBER
BUT
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
THE
PHILLIES
NEVER
LED
THE
LEAGUE
BY
THAT
YEAR
GOING
BY
MEMORY
ALONE
I
BELIEVE
THEIR
BIGGEST
LEAD
WAS
GAMES
AND
THEY
WERE
AHEAD
WHEN
THE
FAMOUS
LOSING
STREAK
BEGAN
A
STREAK
DURING
WHICH
IT
SEEMED
THAT
THEY
FOUND
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
WAY
TO
LOSE
KNOWN
TO
MAN
ANYWAY
I
THINK
THEY
REBOUNDED
JUST
BEFORE
THE
END
AND
WON
THEIR
LAST
COUPLE
GAMES
AND
WERE
STILL
IN
THE
THING
UNTIL
THE
FINAL
DAY
BUT
FINISHED
TIED
WITH
THE
GIANTS
ONE
GAME
OUT
AND
DIDNT
THE
DODGERS
OR
SOMEBODY
ELSE
FINISH
TWO
GAMES
BACK
THAT
HAS
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
CLOSEST
LAST
MINUTE
SCRAMBLES
EVER
OK
YOU
GUYS
STIRRED
UP
MY
CHILDHOOD
MEMORIES
SO
I
WENT
AND
DID
SOME
RESEARCH
ON
THE
FINAL
MONTH
OR
SO
OF
THE
SEASON
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
MY
RECOLLECTIONS
WERE
PRETTY
DARN
ACCURATE
AT
LEAST
AS
FAR
AS
THE
PHILLIES
RECORD
GOES

NOW
IT
DOESNT
APPEAR
TO
ME
THAT

PITCHERS
BUNNING

WERE
REALLY
OVERUSED
AT
LEAST
BY
THE
FOURMAN
ROTATION
STANDARD
OF
THE
DAY
UNTIL
WELL
ALONG
INTO
THE
LOSING
STREAK
AT
WHICH
TIME
MAUCH
WAS
PROBABLY
DESPERATE
FOR
A
WIN
AT
ANY
COST
BECAUSE
THE
PHILLIES
SUBSTANTIAL
LEAD
HAD
EVAPORATED
THE
WAY
THEY
WERE
USED
AT
THAT
TIME
MAY
HAVE
MADE
THE
PROBLEM
WORSE
ALTHOUGH
BUNNING
HAD
ONE
OF
HIS
SHARPEST
GAMES

THE

IN
THE

STACKS
UP
AGAINST
THE

ALSO
NOTICE
THAT

PLAYED
