WRITES
IN

ANUJ
GUPTA
WRITES
EVERYTIME
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
ON
THE
NET
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
SUCCESSFULS
SEASON
BY
THE
PHILADELPHIA
PHILLIES
I
HAVE
GOTTEN
RIPPED
FROM
EVERYBODY
FROM
PITTSBURGH
TO
CALCUTTA
BUT
IF
ALL
THE
IGNORAMOUSES
CARE
TO
LOOK
AT
THIS
WEEKS
BASEBALL
WEEKLY
THEY
WILL
SEE
THAT
IM
NOT
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
CONSIDERS
THEN
AS
DIVISION
WINNERS
THE
REST
OF
THE
MOST
RESPECTED
BASEBALL
WRITERS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
DO
AS
WELL
AND
THESE
GUYS
CERTAINLY
KNOW
WHAT
THEYRE
TALKING
ABOUT
EVERY
BOZO
FROM
PITTSBURGH
TO
CALCUTTA
WILL
JUST
HAVE
TO
SIT
UP
AND
TAKE
NOTICE
THIS
PHILS
TEAM
IN
AN
OFFENSIVE
JUGGERNAUT
WHICH
IS
GOING
TO
SCORE
A
LOT
OF
RUNS
AND
PUT
UP
A
TON
OF
HITS
ON
THE
SCOREBOARD
YOU
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
SICK
OF
SEEING
PHILLIES
SCATTERED
ALL
OVER
EVERY
OFFENSIVE
LEAGUE
LEADERS
CATEGORY
IN
THE
NEWSPAPER
THESE
GUYS
HIT
THROUGH
SPRING
TRAININGWELL
BEFORE
GETTING
NO
HIT
YESTERDAY
BUT
THEY
HAD
A
PLANE
TO
CATCH
MINUTES
AFTER
THE
GAME
ENDED
SO
THEYRE
MINDS
WERENT
IN
IT
UP
TO
THIS
POINT
I
REALLY
THOUGHT
THIS
HAD
BEEN
WRITTEN
BY
A
PROSDCN
ANTIMEDIOT
POSTER
BLESSED
WITH
A
CERTAIN
TALENT
FOR
SARCASM
AND
BITING
REMARKS
SOMEBODY
LIKE
ME
FOR
INSTANCE
THE
LURID
OVERSTATEMENTS
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
INTENDED
TO
HUMILIATE
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
NOW
ON
TOP
OF
THE
GREAT
OFFENSE
THEY
HAVE
A
SLIGHTLY
ABOVE
AVERAGE
PITCHING
STAFF
WHICH
HAS
A
LOT
OF
YOUTH
AND
PROMISE
IF
THE
PITCHERS
DO
THEIR
PART
AND
MITCH
KEEPS
BLOWN
SAVES
TO
A
MINIMUM
LOOK
FOR
ANOTHER
PENNANT

BUT
THEN
THE
SCALES
WERE
LIFTED
FROM
MY
EYES
LOOKS
LIKE
ROBERT
IS
REALLY
BEING
SERIOUS
OH
WELL
I
COMPARE
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
THE
PHILLIES
WITH
THE
EDITION
WHICH
HAD
OUTSTANDING
RUN
PRODUCERS
AT
EVERY
POSITION
EXCEPT
SS
YET
FINISHED
AT
A
FRUSTRATING
LEVEL
THE
FOLKS
DIDNT
EVER
AMOUNT
TO
ANYTHING
AND
NEITHER
WILL
THE
SQUAD
IMHO
ANY
OTHER
PARALLELS
