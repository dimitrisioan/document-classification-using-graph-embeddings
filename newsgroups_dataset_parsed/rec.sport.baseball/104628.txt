JACK
MORRIS

MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
NOT
AT
ALL
I
AM
TALKING
ABOUT
MORRIS
WINNING
WITH
TORONTO
LAST
YEAR
YOU
ARE
ABOUT
TO
LAUNCH
INTO
A
FANTASY
ABOUT
THE
RED
JAYS
AND
HOW
TORONTO
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
WITH
VIOLA
ON
THEIR
TEAM
VIOLA
DIDNT
PLAY
FOR
TORONTO
LAST
YEAR
MORRIS
DID
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
YOUR
NIHILISTIC
APPROACH
ROGER
IS
THAT
IT
TAKES
ALL
THE
SENSE
OUT
OF
THE
GAME
BY
YOUR
LINE
OF
REASONING
IF
A
GUY
HITS
INTO
A
DOUBLE
PLAY
WITH
ONE
OUT
AND
THE
BASES
LOADED
THERES
NO
POINT
IN
SAYING
THAT
THAT
WAS
A
BAD
THING
TO
DO
IF
HIS
TEAM
WON
ANYWAY
OR
SPECULATING
ON
WHAT
MIGHT
HAVE
HAPPENED
IF
THINGS
HAD
GONE
OTHERWISE
SO
THE
DOUBLE
PLAY
IS
MERELY
AN
EVENT
THAT
HAPPENED
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
A
GAME
THAT
WAS
EVENTUALLY
WON
OR
LOST
FOR
UNKNOWN
REASONS
AFTER
ALL
ANY
SPECULATION
INVOLVES
CONSTRUCTING
A
FANTASY
ABOUT
WHAT
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
BUT
DIDNT
ROGER
DO
YOU
EVER
WORRY
THAT
THE
NEXT
PENCIL
YOU
DROP
WILL
FALL
TO
THE
CEILING
INSTEAD
OR
ARE
YOU
WILLING
TO
CONSIDER
EMPIRICAL
EVIDENCE
TEAMS
GO
TO
THE
POSTSEASON
WHEN
THEY
WIN
MORE
GAMES
THAN
ANYBODY
ELSE
IN
THEIR
DIVISION
IF
THEY
DONT
MAKE
THE
POSTSEASON
THEY
DONT
WIN
THE
SERIES
WILL
YOU
AGREE
THAT
WINNING
A
DIVISION
IS
A
USEFUL
INTERMEDIATE
GOAL
IN
RINGCOLLECTING
IF
SO
YOU
MUST
AGREE
THAT
WINNING
GAMES
IS
A
USEFUL
INTERMEDIATE
GOAL
TOWARDS
WINNING
THE
DIVISION
AND
OUR
DISAGREEMENTS
COME
WHEN
WE
CONSIDER
HOW
TO
WIN
GAMES
IN
YOUR
VIEWPOINT
AS
EXPRESSED
WINNING
GAMES
HAPPENS
FOR
REASONS
THAT
CANNOT
BE
ANALYZED
WHILE
MANY
OF
US
ARE
THINKING
THINGS
LIKE
BASE
RUNNERS
ARE
GOOD
OUTS
ARE
BAD
AND
THEREFORE
WALKS
ARE
BETTER
THAN
DOUBLE
PLAYS
WITH
THE
BASES
LOADED
YOU
ARE
THINKING
THINGS
LIKE
ITS
A
TEAM
GAME
SO
PERHAPS
THE
DOUBLE
PLAY
WILL
CAUSE
SOME
MYSTERIOUS
TEAM
DYNAMICS
THAT
WILL
CAUSE
THE
TEAM
TO
WIN
TODAY
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
IT
BECOMES
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
INDIVIDUAL
PLAYERS
PERHAPS
ATLANTA
WOULD
HAVE
WON
THE
SERIES
WITH
ME
PLAYING
LEFT
FIELD
AFTER
ALL
PERHAPS
IN
SOME
WAY
MY
KNOWLEDGE
AND
PERSONALITY
WOULD
HAVE
HELPED
THE
TEAM
MORE
THAN
MY
COMPLETE
LACK
OF
SKILL
WOULD
HAVE
HURT
IT
THEREFORE
I
COULD
BE
AN
EXTREMELY
VALUABLE
PLAYER
DID
DAVE
WINFIELD
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
JAYS
VICTORY
PROBABLY
BUT
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
IF
YOU
REPLACE
HIM
WITH
ANDRES
GALARRAGA
PERHAPS
THE
JAYS
WOULD
HAVE
WON
PERHAPS
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
LOST
PERHAPS
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DEFECTED
TO
ALPHA
CENTAURI
BEARING
IN
MIND
THAT
THE
FLYING
SAUCERS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
LANDED
IN
MIDSEASON
HAD
WINFIELD
BEEN
DHING
FOR
TORONTO
WAS
BABE
RUTH
A
GOOD
PLAYER
HE
PLAYED
ON
SOME
WSWINNING
TEAMS
BUT
DID
HE
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THEIR
SUCCESS
IT
IS
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
THAT
ERNIE
BANKS
WAS
A
GOOD
BASEBALL
PLAYER
AND
JARVIS
BROWN
AND
DAN
SCHATZEDER
WERENT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ANYBODY
WHO
WOULD
DENY
THIS
NEEDS
TO
PROVIDE
THE
PROOF
NOW
WE
HAVE
OBSERVED
THINGS
ABOUT
BASEBALL
OVER
THE
YEARS
BOTH
EMPIRICALLY
AND
BY
LOOKING
AT
THE
RULEBOOK
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
SCORE
MORE
RUNS
THAN
ONES
OPPONENT
TO
WIN
THE
GAME
SO
IT
WOULD
SEEM
IMPORTANT
TO
SCORE
RUNS
AND
TO
PREVENT
ONES
OPPONENT
FROM
SCORING
RUNS
ARE
SCORED
WHILE
A
TEAM
IS
BATTING
AND
AN
INNING
ENDS
AFTER
THE
THIRD
OUT
SO
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
MAKING
OUTS
IS
BAD
WHILE
HITTING
HOME
RUNS
IS
GOOD
PLAYERS
HAVE
TENDENCIES
TO
HIT
OR
PITCH
AT
CERTAIN
LEVELS
AND
THESE
ARE
USUALLY
SOMEWHAT
CONSISTENT
FROM
YEAR
TO
YEAR
WE
DO
USE
THESE
STATISTICS
TO
PREDICT
WINNERS
AND
SO
DO
YOU
TO
MAKE
SOME
FLAT
PREDICTIONS
BARRY
BONDS
WILL
HAVE
A
HIGHER
OBPSLG
THAN
GENE
LARKIN
THIS
YEAR
THE
BRAVES
WILL
FINISH
AHEAD
OF
THE
ROCKIES
IN
THE
STANDINGS
THE
TIGERS
WILL
SCORE
MORE
RUNS
THAN
THE
ROYALS
BUT
WILL
ALSO
GIVE
UP
MORE
I
WOULD
BE
ASTONISHED
IF
ANY
OF
THESE
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
FALSE
AND
I
SUSPECT
SO
WOULD
YOU
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FACT
I
AM
PRETTY
SURE
I
CAN
PREDICT
ALL
THE
DIVISION
WINNERS
THIS
YEAR
GIVEN
GUESSES
PER
DIVISION
AND
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
BETTER
THAN
RANDOM
CHANCE
AND
ALMOST
STATISTICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
IF
YOU
WILL
ADMIT
THAT
THE
ROCKIES
AND
MARINERS
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
MEET
IN
THE
WORLD
SERIES
YOU
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
SORT
OF
WAY
TO
MEASURE
LIKELIHOODS
HOWEVER
FUZZY
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
ALL
OTHER
THINGS
TO
BE
EQUAL
SO
YOUR
FANTASY
IS
TOTALLY
MEANINGLESS
SO
HOW
ABOUT
REAL
LIFE
PERSON
A
ROBS
A
SERVICE
STATION
WITH
TWO
PEOPLE
IN
IT
USING
A
AUTOMATIC
PISTOL
GETS
AND
IS
CONVICTED
AND
SENTENCED
FOR
THREE
YEARS
PERSON
B
WITH
A
SIMILAR
CRIMINAL
RECORD
ROBS
A
SERVICE
STATION
WITH
TWO
PEOPLE
IN
IT
USING
A
REVOLVER
GETS
AND
IS
CONVICTED
SINCE
THEY
USED
TWO
DIFFERENT
TYPES
OF
HANDGUN
ARE
COMPARISONS
TOTALLY
MEANINGLESS
SAY
YOU
DROP
A
PENCIL
TO
SEE
IF
THE
GRAVITY
STILL
WORKS
MY
CATS
ARE
ALWAYS
TESTING
THIS
THEY
DONT
TRUST
ME
TO
PAY
THE
GRAVITY
BILL
ON
TIME
YOU
HAVE
NEVER
DROPPED
A
PENCIL
AT
THAT
EXACT
TIME
OF
THE
CENTURY
BEFORE
SO
ALL
PREVIOUS
EVIDENCE
IS
MEANINGLESS
OR
WOULD
YOU
BE
SURPRISED
IF
IT
FLEW
OUT
THE
WINDOW
INSTEAD
OF
HITTING
THE
DESK
DAVID
THORNLEY
WHO
HAS
NO
REPLICA
WORLD
SERIES
RINGS
BUT
DOES
HAVE
TICKETS
TO
THE
WORLD
SERIES
IN
THE
METRODOME
