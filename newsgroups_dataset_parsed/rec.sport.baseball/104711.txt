this
morning
had
an
interview
with
linda
mccarthy
name
possibly
garbled
by
me
an
official
historian
for
the
cia
she
has
won
an
emmy
for
research
on
moe
berg
for
a
tv
documentary
which
i
know
from
nothing
but
which
sounds
good
she
said
that
among
other
things
berg
was
the
principal
spy
for
the
oss
cias
wwii
precursor
spying
on
axis
atomic
programs
because
of
his
physics
background
and
language
skills
she
said
that
during
the
war
he
met
with
heisenberg
in
switzerland
and
had
instructions
to
shoot
heisenberg
if
the
germans
were
close
to
us
in
bomb
research
he
concluded
they
were
two
years
behind
and
didnt
shoot
him
i
have
heard
elsewhere
that
heisenberg
deliberately
misled
the
nazi
bomb
program
but
i
dont
know
how
reliable
this
is
unfortunately
npr
didnt
mention
any
kind
of
a
book
shes
writing
id
certainly
buy
it
dave
mb
there
is
a
great
book
out
called
they
also
served
which
is
about
the
ballplayers
during
wwii
there
is
some
info
on
berg
in
there
it
also
has
info
on
pete
gray
one
armed
outfielder
and
other
players
of
the
era
because
of
the
draft
many
players
during
the
war
were
those
who
were
exempt
from
the
draft
for
medical
reasons
there
are
some
very
interesting
stories
in
the
book
it
is
very
well
written
and
i
would
suggest
reading
it
to
anyone
with
an
interest
in
baseball
