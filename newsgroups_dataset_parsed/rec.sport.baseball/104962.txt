can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
why
they
call
lefthanded
pitchers
i
dont
know
about
the
story
but
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
in
most
stadiums
the
batter
faces
northeast
and
so
when
a
pitcher
is
on
the
mound
his
left
arm
is
to
the
south
hence
the
term
southpaw
also
the
story
on
how
the
term
originated
thanks
go
cubs
prediction
they
will
finish
over
this
year
without
winning
the
east
