the
only
really
valid
retort
to
valentine
is
werent
the
red
sox
trying
to
get
morris
too
oh
sure
they
said
viola
was
their
first
choice
afterwards
but
what
should
we
have
expected
they
would
say
lou
wanted
morris
all
along
the
idiot
giving
the
man
million
to
play
with
is
like
giving
a
five
year
old
a
loaded
uzi
with
the
safety
off
the
only
question
is
how
many
shots
he
will
get
off
before
somebody
is
wise
enough
to
take
it
away
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
this
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the
division
more
like
if
this
is
true
it
wont
be
for
lack
of
contribution
by
viola
so
who
cares
i
dont
see
why
people
expect
boston
to
finish
sixth
the
bottom
four
teams
last
year
were
essentially
tied
boston
in
seventh
place
had
wins
the
yankees
and
indians
tied
for
fourth
place
had
wins
now
i
should
think
it
is
obvious
that
the
red
sox
improved
more
than
the
indians
or
tigers
basically
the
red
sox
are
stronger
this
year
at
dh
ss
lf
and
rf
they
have
healthier
starting
pitchers
so
far
at
least
and
better
relievers
i
see
no
reason
why
they
shouldnt
win
games
meanwhile
the
indians
are
in
shambles
and
the
tigers
still
have
no
pitching
they
will
win
some
blowouts
but
they
will
lose
an
awful
lot
of
games
too
maybe
the
sox
will
play
poorly
win
games
and
finish
fifth
but
i
think
third
or
fourth
place
is
more
likely
cheers
valentine
