HI
THERE
IM
GERMAN
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
INTO
THIS
MLB
STUFF
SINCE
ALMOST
ONE
YEAR
NOW
THERE
ARE
MANY
PROBLEMS
OCCURING
FOR
ME
ONE
OF
THEM
IS
THE
ERA
STATISTIC
FOR
PITCHERS
WHAT
DOES
IT
SAY
ERA
INDICATES
THE
AVERAGE
NUMBER
OF
EARNED
RUNS
ATTRIBUTED
TO
A
PITCHER
PER
NINE
INNING
GAME
THUS
IF
A
PITCHER
PITCHED
INNINGS
AND
GAVE
UP
EARNED
RUN
HIS
INNING
EQUIVELENT
PERFOMANCE
WOULD
BE
EARNED
RUNS
THUS
HIS
ERA
IS
TO
COMPUTE
THE
ERA
YOU
SIMPLY
TAKE
THE
NUMBER
OF
EARNED
RUNS
DIVIDED
BY
THE
INNINGS
PITCHED
AND
THEN
MULTIPLE
THE
RESULT
BY
ERA
ERIP
AN
EARNED
RUN
IS
RUN
THAT
IS
GIVEN
UP
BY
THE
PITCHER
THAT
IS
NOT
ATTRIBUTED
TO
A
FIELDING
ERROR
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
IF
AN
ERROR
OCCURS
THAT
REPRESENTED
THE
THIRD
OUT
ALL
RUNS
SCORED
AFTER
THE
ERROR
ARE
CONSIDERED
UNEARNED
RUNS
EARNED
RUNS
ARE
ALSO
RUNS
SCORED
AS
A
RESULT
OF
PLAYERS
WHO
WERE
LEFT
ON
BASE
WHEN
THE
PITCHER
EXITED
THE
GAME
HERE
ARE
SOME
EXAMPLES
IF
THERE
ARE
TWO
OUTS
IN
AN
INNING
AND
THERE
ARE
MEN
ON
BASE
IF
AN
ERROR
OCCURS
THAT
REPRESENTS
THE
THIRD
OUT
ALL
OF
THE
RUNS
AFTER
THIS
ERROR
AND
NOT
COUNTED
AS
EARNED
RUNS
IF
A
PITCHER
ISSUES
SOME
BASE
ON
BALLS
WALKS
AND
LEAVES
THE
GAME
BEFORE
THE
INNING
IS
COMPLETED
HE
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
LEFT
ON
BASE
IF
THE
THOSE
RUNNERS
WHO
WERE
LEFT
ON
BASE
SCORE
AND
THE
SCORE
WAS
NOT
A
RESULT
OF
AN
ERROR
THOSE
ERANED
RUNS
ARE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
THE
PITCHER
WHO
LEFT
THE
GAME
I
HOPE
THIS
EXPLAINS
THINGS
FOR
YOU
JOE
