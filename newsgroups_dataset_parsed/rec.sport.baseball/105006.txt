OFF
THIS
LIST
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE

YOU
IM
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
SANDBERG

THE
TWO
MOST
IMPORTANT
OFFENSIVE
STATISTICS
YOU
CAN

BUT
THE
FACT
REMAINS
THE
TEAM
THAT
SCORES
MORE
RUNS
WINS
THE
GAME
RIGHT
SO
WHO
CARES
WHICH
PLAYER
GETS
CREDITED
AS
LONG
AS
THE
TEAM
GETS
MORE
RUNS
IF
A
PLAYER
HELPS
THE
TEAM
GET
MORE
