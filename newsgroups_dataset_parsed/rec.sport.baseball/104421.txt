ONE
ALSO
HAS
TO
SEPARATE
OFFENSE
INTO
BATTING
AND
BASERUNNING
WITH
THE
SPLIT
PROBABLY
SOMEWHERE
AROUND
AND
ID
GIVE
BASERUNNING
A
LITTLE
MORE
CREDIT
THAN
THAT
MAYBE
OR
EVEN
GIVE
A
TEAM
OF
ROBERTO
ALOMAR
AND
A
TEAM
OF
JOHN
OLERUDS
IDENTICAL
BATTING
STATS
WHICH
WOULDNT
BE
THAT
UNREASONABLE
AND
EVEN
IF
YOU
DONT
LET
ROBERTO
STEAL
A
SINGLE
BASE
THEYLL
SCORE
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THE
OLERUDS

GORDON
I
WOULDNT
GIVE
BASERUNNING
THAT
MUCH
VALUE
I
MEANT
TO
COMMENT
ON
THIS
AT
THE
TIME
THERES
JUST
NO
WAY
BASERUNNING
COULD
BE
THAT
IMPORTANT
IF
IT
WAS
RUNS
CREATED
WOULDNT
BE
NEARLY
AS
ACCURATE
AS
IT
IS
RUNS
CREATED
IS
USUALLY
ABOUT
ACCURATE
ON
A
TEAM
LEVEL
AND
THERES
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
BASERUNNING
THAT
HAS
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
REMAINING
PERCENT
