mvp
revisited
tim
shippert
recently
posted
summaries
of
last
years
defensive
average
stats
in
terms
of
the
linear
weights
estimated
runvalue
of
defensive
performances
compared
to
league
average
ive
combined
those
with
my
positionadjusted
mlv
numbers
to
come
up
with
firstapproximation
total
run
values
for
players
last
year
we
can
use
these
as
a
springboard
for
reconsideration
of
the
mvp
award
major
caveats
these
numbers
include
no
defensive
park
adjustment
so
if
san
diego
really
is
just
a
question
of
odd
scoring
or
gopher
holes
in
the
infield
that
will
cause
some
inaccuracies
the
offensive
numbers
are
positionadjusted
but
not
park
adjusted
so
we
have
to
deflate
some
and
inflate
others
to
be
fair
finally
we
still
dont
know
what
to
do
about
catchers
and
i
have
no
idea
how
to
evaluate
the
defensive
contributions
of
tony
phillips
and
bip
roberts
having
said
that
there
are
still
some
surprises
lets
look
national
league
first
all
numbers
in
total
runs
contributed
over
the
season
player
offense
defense
total
sandberg
bonds
walker
justice
daulton
larkin
grace
as
i
see
it
these
are
the
legitimate
mvp
candidates
from
last
season
if
you
deflate
sandbergs
offense
a
wee
bit
for
playing
in
wrigley
you
get
essentially
a
dead
heat
had
bonds
been
his
usual
defensive
self
it
wouldnt
have
been
close
but
that
apparently
wasnt
the
case
darren
daulton
needs
or
more
defensive
runs
to
make
up
the
offensive
difference
and
i
couldnt
tell
you
whether
thats
easy
or
impossible
a
good
case
could
be
made
for
any
of
sandberg
bonds
or
daulton
as
top
dude
my
personal
vote
bonds
sandberg
daulton
walker
justice
in
the
american
league
player
offense
defense
total
ventura
martinez
b
anderson
thomas
r
henderson
raines
tettleton
ok
lets
see
a
show
of
hands
how
many
of
you
picked
robin
ventura
as
top
player
in
the
al
last
year
i
certainly
didnt
but
id
have
a
hard
time
arguing
against
him
at
this
point
yes
i
know
these
numbers
are
only
approximate
but
thats
a
big
gap
between
him
and
the
guy
also
those
of
you
who
thought
rickey
henderson
stank
last
year
are
out
of
your
minds
once
again
theres
a
catcher
in
the
ointment
if
calling
a
game
is
as
important
as
it
might
be
runs
is
easy
to
make
up
or
give
away
take
a
guess
folks
i
dont
think
we
can
do
any
better
than
that
my
personal
vote
excluding
pitchers
ventura
tettleton
anderson
martinez
henderson
im
a
big
frank
thomas
fan
but
i
have
to
admit
to
a
bias
in
favor
of
balanced
offensivedefensive
contribution
which
should
have
a
higher
leverage
in
wl
record
than
an
equal
shift
that
is
lots
of
offense
with
negative
defense
for
the
record
carlos
baerga
roberto
alomar
forget
it
its
a
wash
let
me
also
take
this
opportunity
to
admit
that
i
was
grossly
wrong
regarding
don
mattinglys
defense
this
past
season
don
recovered
brilliantly
from
his
weak
and
to
end
up
with
mattingly
runs
which
is
clearly
an
aboveaverage
first
baseman
however
its
still
runs
behind
mark
mcgwire
runs
behind
frank
thomas
and
runs
behind
john
olerud
on
the
other
hand
its
ahead
of
rafael
palmeiro
cecil
fielder
and
every
other
al
first
baseman
not
yet
mentioned

greetings
sir
with

not
quick
member
iie
orsa
tims
sabr
hands
not
soft
eye
not
discerning
and
in
denver
they
call
you
a
slugger
the
big
catullus
galarraga
and
compare
you
to
my
own
mattingly
