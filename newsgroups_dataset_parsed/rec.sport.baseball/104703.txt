TOTAL

VALUES
FOR

LAST

WE
CAN
USE
THESE
AS
A
SPRINGBOARD
FOR
RECONSIDERATION
OF
THE
MVP
AWARD
MAJOR
CAVEATS
THESE
NUMBERS
INCLUDE
NO
DEFENSIVE
PARK
ADJUSTMENT
SO
IF
SAN
DIEGO
REALLY
IS
JUST
A
QUESTION
OF
ODD
SCORING
OR
GOPHER
HOLES
IN
THE
INFIELD
THAT
WILL
CAUSE
SOME
INACCURACIES
THE
OFFENSIVE
NUMBERS
ARE
POSITIONADJUSTED
BUT
NOT
PARK
ADJUSTED
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
DEFLATE
SOME
AND
INFLATE
OTHERS
TO
BE
FAIR
FINALLY
WE
STILL
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
ABOUT
CATCHERS
AND
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
TO
EVALUATE
THE
DEFENSIVE
CONTRIBUTIONS
OF
TONY
PHILLIPS
AND
BIP
ROBERTS
HAVING
SAID
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL

AS
I
SEE
IT
THESE
ARE
THE
LEGITIMATE
MVP
CANDIDATES
FROM
LAST

IF
YOU
DEFLATE
SANDBERGS
OFFENSE
A
WEE
BIT
FOR
PLAYING
IN
WRIGLEY
YOU
GET
ESSENTIALLY
A
DEAD
HEAT
HAD
BONDS
BEEN
HIS
USUAL
DEFENSIVE
SELF
IT
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
CLOSE
BUT
THAT
APPARENTLY
WASNT
THE
CASE
DARREN
DAULTON
NEEDS
OR
MORE
DEFENSIVE
RUNS
TO
MAKE
UP
THE
OFFENSIVE
DIFFERENCE
AND
I
COULDNT
TELL
YOU
WHETHER
THATS
EASY
OR
IMPOSSIBLE
A
GOOD
CASE
COULD
BE
MADE
FOR
ANY
OF

OK
LETS
SEE
A
SHOW
OF
HANDS
HOW
MANY
OF
YOU
PICKED
ROBIN
VENTURA
AS
TOP
PLAYER
IN
THE
AL
LAST
YEAR
I
CERTAINLY
DIDNT
BUT
ID
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
ARGUING
AGAINST
HIM
AT
THIS
POINT
YES
I
KNOW
THESE
NUMBERS
ARE
ONLY
APPROXIMATE
BUT
THATS
A
BIG
GAP
BETWEEN
HIM
AND
THE
GUY
ALSO
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
THOUGHT
RICKEY
HENDERSON
STANK
LAST
YEAR
ARE
OUT
OF
YOUR
MINDS
ONCE
AGAIN
THERES
A
CATCHER
IN
THE
OINTMENT
IF
CALLING
A
GAME
IS
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
IT
MIGHT
BE
RUNS
IS
EASY
TO
MAKE
UP
OR
GIVE
AWAY
TAKE
A
GUESS
FOLKS
I
DONT
THINK
WE
CAN
DO
ANY
BETTER
THAN
THAT
MY
PERSONAL

EXCLUDING

I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT

FAVOR
OF
BALANCED
OFFENSIVEDEFENSIVE
CONTRIBUTION
WHICH
SHOULD
HAVE
A
HIGHER
LEVERAGE
IN

THAN
AN
EQUAL

THAT
IS
LOTS
OF

WRONG
REGARDING

DEFENSE
THIS
PAST

BRILLIANTLY
FROM
HIS
WEAK
