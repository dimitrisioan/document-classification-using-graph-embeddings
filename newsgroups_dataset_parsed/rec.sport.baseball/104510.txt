RE
DAVE
KINGMAN
FOR
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
IN
ARTICLE
STEVE
TOMASSI
WRITES
HI
BASEBALL
FANS
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
SAY
DONT
YOU
THINK
HE
DESERVES
IT
I
MEAN
HECK
IF
DAVE
WINFIELD
HOHUM
IS
SERIOUSLY
BEING
CONSIDERED
FOR
IT
AS
IS
LEE
SMITH
HA
THEN
WHY
DONT
WE
GIVE
DAVE
KINGMAN
A
CHANCE
OR
DARRELL
EVANS
YEAH
YEAH
AFTER
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
TAKES
IN
THEM
IT
CAN
TAKE
IN
EDDIE
MURRAY
AND
JEFF
REARDON
OH
YEAH
DAVE
WINFIELDMARGINAL
PLAYER
GUY
DIDNT
HIT
A
LICK
HAD
NEGLIGIBLE
POWER
WAS
A
CRAP
FIELDER
AND
HAD
NO
STAYING
POWER
DAVE
WINFIELD
NOW
ENTERING
HIS
I
BELIEVE
BIG
LEAGUE
SEASON
IS
STILL
A
DAMN
DECENT
HITTER
ADMITTEDLY
HIS
DEFENSE
HAS
SLIPPED
A
GREAT
DEAL
BUT
IN
HIS
PRIME
HE
HAD
A
POWERFUL
ARM
AND
GREAT
RANGE
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
STATS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
YOU
EVEN
BEGIN
TO
MAKE
AN
ARGUMENT
THAT
WINFIELD
AND
KINGMAN
ARE
SIMILAR
PLAYERS
KINGMAN
WAS
A
ONEDIMENSION
POWER
HITTERHE
COULDNT
FIELD
HE
RAN
LIKE
AN
ANVIL
HIT
FOR
A
LOW
AVERAGE
THOUGH
IF
I
REMEMBER
RIGHT
HIS
OBP
WASNT
THAT
HIDEOUS
AND
FOR
THOSE
WHO
CONSIDER
SUCH
THINGS
IMPORTANT
WAS
A
ABSOLUTEPRIMODICK
EDDIE
MURRAY
YUP
ONLY
THE
BEST
BASEMAN
OF
THE
I
KNOW
THAT
MVP
VOTES
ARE
CONDUCTED
BY
MEDIOTS
BUT
GIVEN
THAT
HE
GOT
JOBBED
OUT
OF
THE
MVP
HE
DESERVED
IN
IT
SEEMS
THAT
HE
WASNT
OVERRATED
BY
THE
MEDIA
LEE
SMITH
HMMMM
THIS
ONES
ACTUALLY
PRETTY
CLOSE
HES
HAD
A
S
SOLID
DEPENDABLE
CAREER
AS
A
CLOSER
DESPITE
PITCHING
IN
SOME
NASTY
PARKS
WRIGLEY
FENWAY
ID
HAVE
TO
TAKE
A
CLOSER
LOOK
AT
THE
STATS
ITS
BEEN
A
WHILE
BUT
IT
SEEMS
LEE
ARTHUR
IS
OF
HOF
CALIBER
YOU
DO
MAKE
A
LEGITIMATE
POINT
ABOUT
THE
HOF
CREDENTIALS
OF
RELIEVERS
SIMPLY
RACKING
UP
A
LOT
OF
SAVES
DOESNT
MEAN
A
WHOLE
HELL
OF
A
LOT
IF
YOU
BLOW
A
BUNCH
TOO
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
MINNESOTA
AND
BOSTON
AND
FOR
A
MONTH
ATLANTA
USED
REARDON
AS
A
CLOSER
FOR
LONGER
THAN
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ONE
THE
EQUALIZER
HAS
RACKED
UP
AN
IMPRESSIVE
NUMBER
OF
SAVES
NO
WAY
SHOULD
HOMERMAN
BE
IN
THE
HOF
IMHO
DARRELL
EVANS
NICE
CAREER
ACTUALLY
A
BIT
UNDERRATED
KINDA
LIKE
TED
SIMMONS
IMHO
BUT
NOT
A
HOFER
WELL
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
SICK
AND
TIRED
MOSTLY
SICK
OF
EVERYBODY
GIVING
HALL
OF
FAME
CONSIDERATION
TO
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
BY
TODAYS
STANDARDS
MARGINAL
LEMME
ASK
YOU
THIS
WHO
THE
HELL
PLAYING
THE
GAME
ISNT
MARGINAL
HONESTLY
OZZIE
SMITH
AND
ROBIN
YOUNT
DONT
BELONG
THERE
THEYRE
BOTH
SHORTSTOPS
THAT
JUST
HUNG
AROUND
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BIG
DEAL
LETS
BE
A
LITTLE
MORE
SELECTIVE
HUH
STOP
HANDING
OUT
THESE
HONORS
SO
LIBERALLY
SAVE
THEM
FOR
THE
GUYS
WHO
REALLY
DESERVE
IT
FACE
IT
IF
SOMETHING
NOW
WAIT
A
GODDAMN
MINUTE
HERE
OZZIE
SMITH
ABSOLUTELY
REDEFINED
THE
POSITION
OF
SHORTSTOP
HIS
DEFENSE
WAS
SO
GOOD
THAT
HES
WON
SOMETHING
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
GOLD
GLOVES
AGAIN
GOLD
GLOVES
ARE
MEDIOTBIASED
AND
A
GOOD
ARGUMENT
COULD
BE
MADE
THAT
LARKIN
DESERVED
ONE
OR
TWO
OF
OZZIES
MORE
RECENT
AWARDS
BUT
USUALLY
THIS
IS
TEMPERED
BY
SOMEONE
ELSE
IN
THE
EARLY
GETTING
THE
GOLD
GLOVES
OZZIE
DESERVED
EARLIER
IN
HIS
CAREER
OZZIES
OFFENSE
YOU
ASK
GOOD
OBP
GREAT
SPEED
NUMBERS
IN
A
PARK
WHICH
FOR
MOST
OF
HIS
CAREER
DEPRESSED
OFFENSE
ADMITTEDLY
NO
POWER
CEPT
AGAINST
TOM
NIEDENFUER
BUT
STILL
A
DEFINITE
ASSET
OFFENSIVELY
YOUNT
HITS
MVP
AT
TWO
DIFFERENT
POSITIONS
UHHUH
A
REAL
STIFF
HIS
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
YEARS
EVER
BY
A
PLAYER
IN
RECENT
MEMORY
AND
PROBABLY
RANKS
BEHIND
ONLY
THE
PEAK
SEASONS
OF
WAGNER
AND
BANKS
AS
FAR
AS
SS
NUMBERS
GO
HES
A
CLEAR
HOFER
IMHO
ISNT
DONE
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
PRESTIGE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
ANYMORE
WHEN
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE
THAT
STEVE
GARVEY
OR
JACK
MORRIS
ARE
POTENTIAL
CANDIDATES
THE
ABSURDITY
IS
APPARENT
GEE
CAN
THESE
GUYS
EVEN
COMPARE
TO
THE
MORE
LIKELY
FUTURE
HALL
OF
FAMERS
LIKE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
OR
NOLAN
RYAN
WELL
AS
FAR
AS
GARVEY
GOES
YOURE
RIGHT
GARVEY
IS
A
MEDIOT
CANDIDATE
PUSHED
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
WINNING
ATTITUDE
A
MINOR
FACTOR
IF
ONE
AT
ALL
AND
HIS
GREAT
DEFENSE
NO
ERRORS
ADMITTEDLY
BUT
THE
RANGE
OF
A
TREE
STUMP
GARVEY
SHOULDNT
BE
IN
THE
HOF
SKYJACK
IVE
SAID
A
LOT
OF
NASTY
THINGS
ABOUT
SKYJACK
IN
THE
LAST
YEAR
OR
SO
BUT
THIS
IS
MOSTLY
IN
RESPONSE
TO
MEDIOTS
AND
WOOFERS
WHO
TALK
ABOUT
MORRIS
ABILITY
TO
WIN
WHICH
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
MORRIS
ABILITY
TO
PITCH
WHEN
TORONTO
TO
SCORE
TONS
OF
RUNS
AT
THIS
POINT
MORRIS
IS
AN
AVERAGE
PITCHER
ALTHOUGH
FROM
HIS
EARLY
RETURNS
IN
HE
MAY
BE
DAMNED
CLOSE
TO
DONE
BUT
IN
ALL
FAIRNESS
MORRIS
WAS
A
DOMINANT
PITCHER
IN
THE
FOR
UPANDDOWN
TIGER
TEAMS
WHILE
WAS
OBVIOUSLY
A
GREAT
YEAR
FOR
DETROIT
THE
REST
OF
THE
DECADE
THE
TEAM
WAS
GENERALLY
IN
CONTENTION
BUT
NOT
FAVORITES
MORRIS
CAREER
NUMBERS
ARE
QUITE
GOOD
AND
WORTHY
OF
HOF
CONSIDERATION
RYAN
OF
COURSE
BUT
BE
CAREFUL
I
GUARANTEE
YOU
THAT
SOMEONE
WILL
THROW
BACK
YOUR
EARLIER
LOGIC
ABOUT
YOUNT
AND
SMITH
BEING
SHORTSTOPS
WHO
HUNG
AROUND
A
LONG
TIME
AFTER
ALL
NOLAN
NEVER
WON
A
CY
DAMN
HES
JUST
PITCHER
WHO
HUNG
AROUND
FOR
YEARS
HIS
WL
RECORD
IS
MEDIOCRE
OF
COURSE
NOLANS
A
HOFER
PUCK
PROBABLY
ALTHOUGH
HES
GOT
TO
PLAY
REASONABLY
WELL
FOR
A
FEW
MORE
YEARS
YEARS
EVEN
GOOD
ONES
ARENT
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
THE
HOF
MOST
LIKELY
THAT
SAID
I
BELIEVE
PUCKETT
WILL
MAKE
THE
HOF
PRETTY
MUCH
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
THE
REST
OF
HIS
CAREER
TURNS
OUT
BARRING
SOMETHING
REALLY
TRAGIC
OR
SUDDEN
HES
VERY
POPULAR
IN
THE
MEDIA
AND
WITH
FANS
AND
LEGITIMATELY
HAS
BEEN
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
CFS
IN
THE
GAME
SINCE
HE
JOINED
THE
LEAGUE
IVE
ALWAYS
LIKED
THE
GUY
AND
I
HOPE
HE
DOES
MAKE
IT
AND
IN
THE
END
I
THINK
THE
PUCK
WILL
MAKE
IT
IN
BUT
REALLY
ITS
TOO
EARLY
TO
SELL
THIS
DEBATE
COMES
UP
RATHER
FREQUENTLY
ON
THE
NET
AND
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
I
NEVER
TIRE
OF
IT
ITS
AN
INTERESTING
SUBJECT
HERES
AN
OFF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
LIST
OF
POTENTIAL
HOFERS
FROM
EACH
TEAM
I
PROBABLY
LEFT
A
COUPLE
OF
GUYS
OFF
SO
FEEL
FREE
TO
FOLLOW
UP
I
WONT
CONSIDER
ANYONE
WHO
STARTED
PLAYING

TOO
EARLY
