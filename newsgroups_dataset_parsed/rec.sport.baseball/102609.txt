RE
ESPN
AND
EXPANSION
IN
ARTICLE
DONNIE
TRUMP
WRITES
I
WAS
WATCHING
PETER
GAMMONS
ON
ESPN
LAST
NIGHT
AND
HES
GOT
ME
A
LITTLE
CONFUSED
WHILE
TALKING
ABOUT
EXPANSION
HE
STARTED
MENTIONING
PEOPLE
WHO
MIGHT
BENEFIT
FROM
THE
FRINGE
PLAYERS
THEYLL
BE
FACING
MCGRIFF
HITTING
HOME
RUNS
SHEFFIELD
GETTING
RBIS
AND
GLAVINE
WINNING
GAMES
THIS
WAS
OF
COURSE
ALL
IN
REFERENCE
TO
WHAT
HAPPENED
THE
OTHER
TIMES
THAT
BASEBALL
HAS
EXPANDED
EARLY
LATE
LATE
WHAT
REALLY
CONFUSED
ME
THOUGH
WAS
THE
MENTION
OF
AL
PLAYERS
WHO
WOULD
DO
WELL
NEXT
YEAR
SPECIFICALLY
ROGER
CLEMENS
WINNING
GAMES
AND
THE
LIKES
OF
MCGWIRE
AND
GONZALEZ
HITTING
HOME
RUNS
MY
QUESTION
IS
HOW
IN
THE
HELL
WILL
THE
ROCKIESMARLINS
HELP
THE
AL
THE
LAST
TIME
I
LOOKED
THERE
WASNT
A
LOT
OF
TALENT
JUMPING
LEAGUES
DID
I
MISS
SOMETHING
DENNIS
CLEARY
DFCLEARYUCDAVISEDU
I
WONDERED
THE
SAME
THING
WHEN
HE
FIRST
MENTIONED
IT
I
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
JUST
MAKING
A
MISTAKE
BUT
THEN
HE
SAID
IT
OVER
AND
OVER
AND
THEN
IN
THE
EXAMPLES
FROM
OTHER
YEARS
HE
GAVE
STATS
FOR
PLAYERS
FROM
BOTH
LEAGUES
EVEN
WHEN
ONLY
ONE
LEAGUE
EXPANDED
SO
SINCE
STATS
NEVER
LIE
I
GUESS
THERE
IS
AN
EFFECT
ON
BOTH
LEAGUES
BECAUSE
THE
EXPANSION
DRAFT
TAKES
TALENT
FROM
BOTH
LEAGUES
EQUALLY
MAKING
EVERY
TEAM
IN
BOTH
LEAGUES
DILUTE
THEIR
MAJOR
LEAGUE
TALENT
BY
CALLING
UP
PLAYERS
THAT
NORMALLY
THEY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
HAD
THERE
NOT
BEEN
EXPANSION
MAKE
SENSE
