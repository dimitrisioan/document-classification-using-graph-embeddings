SWEEP
LA
METS
LOSE
LIFE
IS
GOOD
JUST
A
FEW
LINES
ABOUT
MY
FAVORITE
TEAM
SWEEPING
THE
DODGERS
ONE
OF
MY
LEAST
FAVORITE
IN
LA
SWEET
ALSO
THE
METS
MY
OTHER
LEAST
FAVORITE
TEAM
LOSS
TO
THE
ROCKIES
MADE
THIS
THIS
A
GREAT
DAY
AND
A
GREAT
START
TO
THE
WEEKEND
AS
THE
CARDINALS
ARE
ON
THE
ESPN
TONIGHT
BIG
LEE
SMITH
IS
HAVING
A
GREAT
START
AND
THE
CARDINALS
SEEM
TO
BE
HITTING
IN
THE
CLUTCH
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
HAVE
HAD
A
FEW
GAMES
WITH
LOTS
OF
HITS
AND
NOT
MANY
RUNS
HOPEFULLY
WITH
THE
COACHES
STRESS
ON
SITUATIONAL
HITTING
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
THE
RUNNERS
LOB
WILL
BE
LOWER
THIS
YEAR
PROBABLY
DUE
TO
THE
HIGH
STRIKEOUT
NUMBERS
BY
JOSE
AND
LANKFORD
AND
ZEILES
OFF
YEAR
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
ALL
THE
FUSS
ABOUT
THE
FILLIES
THE
MEDIA
AND
ALL
THE
FILLY
FANS
ON
RSB
FORGET
WHO
IS
RIGHT
BEHIND
THEM
IN
THE
STANDINGS
GIVE
THE
WILD
THING
A
WEEK
OR
TWO
BEFORE
HE
STARTS
BLOWING
SOME
GAMES
AND
WELL
SEE
WHO
IS
IN
FIRST
THEN
I
BELIEVE
THE
CARDINAL
PITCHING
STAFF
IS
MORE
COMPLETE
THAN
THE
FILLY
STAFF
AND
THAT
WILL
MAKE
THE
DIFFERENCE
ON
A
SIDE
NOTE
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
A
COMMENT
WAS
MADE
BY
SOME
BASEBALL
PLAYER
OR
MANAGER
ABOUT
THE
DODGER
DEFENSE
HE
WAS
ASKED
WHERE
TO
HIT
THE
BALL
AGAINST
THE
DODGERS
AND
HE
REPLIED
FAIR
I
REMEMBER
IT
BEING
IN
THE
THEY
SAID
IT
SECTION
OF
SPORTS
ILLUSTRATED
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHO
SAID
IT
AND
WHAT
ISSUE
IT
WAS
IN
GO
REDBIRDS
