re
tickets
etc
lets
look
at
the
effects
of
inflation
on
superstars
salaries
i
read
once
that
the
babe
made
one
year
and
that
was
about
as
good
as
it
got
for
him
lets
assume
he
made
that
in
im
not
sure
of
the
figures
but
i
know
im
in
the
ballparkpun
intended
today
assuming
a
yearly
inflation
rate
which
is
an
understatement
if
not
accurate
his
measly
salary
would
be
worth
fv
x
x
just
over
assuming
inflation
is
average
of
around
fv
x
almost
i
didnt
crunch
these
numbers
beforehand
these
numbers
might
lead
one
to
believe
that
todays
players
are
slightly
overpaid
the
babe
appears
to
have
made
then
what
todays
average
to
above
average
players
make
now
perfectly
accurate
salary
year
of
salary
and
average
inflation
rate
would
make
this
analysis
more
accurate
but
i
dont
think
im
off
by
much
