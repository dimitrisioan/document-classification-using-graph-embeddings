LOOK
AT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
INFLATION
ON
SUPERSTARS
SALARIES
I
READ
ONCE
THAT
THE
BABE
MADE
ONE

AS
IT
GOT
FOR
HIM
LETS
ASSUME
HE
MADE
THAT
IN
IM
NOT
SURE
OF
THE

BUT
I
KNOW
IM
IN
THE
BALLPARKPUN
INTENDED
TODAY
ASSUMING
A
YEARLY
INFLATION
RATE
WHICH
IS
AN
UNDERSTATEMENT
IF
NOT
ACCURATE
HIS

SALARY
WOULD
BE
WORTH
FV
X
X
JUST

ASSUMING
INFLATION
IS
AVERAGE
OF

APPEARS
TO
HAVE
MADE

WHAT
TODAYS

PERFECTLY
ACCURATE
SALARY
YEAR
OF
SALARY
AND
AVERAGE
INFLATION
