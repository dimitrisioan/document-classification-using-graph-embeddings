DAVID
STEINMAN
SAYS
ORIOLEFANUIUC
WRITES
THE
DEFENITION
OF
THE
UNDERDOG
IS
A
TEAM
THAT
HAS
NO
TALENT
AND
COMES
OUT
OF
NOWHERE
TO
CONTEND
THE
METS
AND
ORIOLES
ARE
PRIME
EXAMPLES
NOT
THE
CUBS
SORRY
BUT
IT
IS
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
WIN
A
DIVISION
WITH
NO
TALENT
OVER
GAMES
I
WOULD
AMEND
YOUR
DEFINITION
TO
UNDERDOG
A
TEAM
EXPECTED
TO
LOSE
BUT
WHICH
WINS
THANKS
TO
UNDERESTIMATED
TALENT
DAVE
OK
THE
METS
AND
OS
ARE
GOOD
EXAMPLES
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
REDS
DO
YOU
REALLY
THINK
THAT
ANYONE
EXPECTED
THEM
TO
SWEEP
THE
AS
I
KNOW
PEOPLE
WHO
DIDNT
EVEN
THINK
THEYD
WIN
A
GAME
LET
ALONE
WIN
THE
SERIES
WE
PROVED
THEM
WRONG
THOUGH
DIDNT
WE
AS
FOR
THIS
YEAR
IGNORE
THEIR
RECORD
NOW
THEYVE
HAD
A
ROCKY
START
AND
THAT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
COLORADO
THEY
SHALL
RISE
AGAIN
THE
HUNT
FOR
A

OCTOBER
CONTINUES
