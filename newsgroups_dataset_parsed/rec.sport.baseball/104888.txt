KEN
KUBEY
WRITES
I
DIDNT
SAY
THAT
PITCHERS
FEAR
OF
THROWING
STRIKES
TO
GUYS
LIKE
MCGWIRE
BONDS
AND
FRANK
THOMAS
WAS
RATIONAL
I
JUST
SAID
THAT
IT
EXISTS
BUT
WHY
MCGWIRE
AND
NOT
CARTER
I
CAN
SEE
SOME
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
BONDS
OR
THOMAS
BECAUSE
THEY
TEND
TO
HAVE
HIGHER
BATTING
AVERAGES
BUT
THE
MAJOR
DIFFERENCE
I
SEE
BETWEEN
MCGWIRE
AND
CARTER
IS
THAT
CARTER
DOESNT
DRAW
WALKS
WHY
ARENT
PITCHERS
AFRAID
TO
THROW
STRIKES
TO
CARTER
