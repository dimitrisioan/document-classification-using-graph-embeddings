THERES
TOO
MANY
S
HERE
FOR
MY
TASTE
BY
NOW
WHICH
MEANS
IVE
REACHED
MY
MAXIMUM
DEPTH
ON
THIS
THREAD
IVE
CUT
OUT
SOME
THINGS
BELOW
BUT
NOTHING
THAT
SHOULD
AFFECT
THE
SENSE
OF
THE
DISCUSSION
I
AGREE
ILL
DELETE

JONATHAN
KING
WRITES
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
GIVE
A
MORE
RECENT
CITATION
OF
ANY
PLAYER
MENTIONED
AS
A
MALINGERER
THANKS
I
GUESS
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
QUESTION
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
IMPLY
THAT
THE
ACCUSATIONS
OF
GLENN
DAVIS
MALINGERING
WERE
CERTAINLY
NOT
PLAYED
UP
VERY
MUCH
STILL
IF
THE
WHISPERS
REACHED
SAN
FRANCISCO
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
POSSIBLE
THEY
WERE
STRONGER
ELSEWHERE
ALSO
IT
WAS
TEAMMATES
MAKING
THE
ASPERSIONS
IN
ANY
EVENT
I
KNOW
OF
NO
OTHER
PLAYER
TO
BE
MALIGNED
IN
THE
LAST
COUPLE
YEARS
BUT
IN
ANY
CASE
I
BELIEVE
MIKE
LAVALLIERE
HAS
BEEN
ACCUSED
OF
POOR
WORK
HABITS
AND
GENERAL
SLOTH
RECENTLY
PROBABLY
NOT
MALINGERING
JUST
AS
HE
WAS
BEING
RELEASED
ITS
INTERESTING
THAT
NOBODY
HEARD
MUCH
ABOUT
THESE
PROBLEMS
BEFORE
IF
THEY
WERE
SO
IMPORTANT
I
HAVE
HEARD
SANDERS
CALLED
MANY
THINGS
AS
WELL
I
HAVE
NOT
HEARD
HIM
CALLED
LAZY
GIVEN
THE
PHENOMENON
IT
WOULD
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
LABEL
HIM
AS
SUCH
EXACTLY
SO
WHICH
MEANS
HIS
MEDIA
DETRACTORS
HAVE
HAD
TO
SAY
OTHER
THINGS
ABOUT
HIM
I
BELIEVE
ITS
A
GENERAL
PHENOMENON
THAT
IF
WRITERS
DONT
LIKE
YOU
THEYLL
FIND
A
LABEL
THAT
WILL
STICK
NO
MATTER
WHO
YOU
ARE
I
FIND
MYSELF
MORE
INTERESTED
IN
THE
SELECTION
OF
LABELS
THAN
IN
WHY
WRITERS
FEEL
THEY
NEED
TO
ACT
THIS
WAY
NOT
THAT
THIS
FASCINATES
ME
THAT
MUCH
EITHER
UH
THE
ORIGINAL
AUTHORS
POINT
WAS
THAT
BLACK
AND
WHITE
PLAYERS
WERE
POR
TRAYED
DIFFERENTLY
BY
THE
MEDIA
AND
TOWARDS
THIS
HE
GAVE
A
HIGHLY
SELECTED
LIST
TO
PROVE
HIS
CASE
SANDERS
NAME
SHOWED
UP
EVENTUALLY
I
DISPUTE
THAT
SANDERS
HAS
EVER
BEEN
CALLED
LAZY
BY
THE
MEDIA
HMM
BIG
EGO
POSSIBLE
CLUB
HOUSE
DISTURBANCE
ETC
IS
THAT
GOOD
PRESS
NO
BUT
IT
ISNT
THE
TOTAL
EXTENT
OF
THE
PRESS
HE
RECEIVED
IN
PITTSBURGH
WHERE
HE
WAS
CALLED
ALL
KINDS
OF
THINGS
INCLUDING
LAZY
AND
SPOILED
BY
THE
LOCAL
COLUMNISTS
AGAIN
THE
ACTUAL
WORDS
USED
MAY
SHIFT
AROUND
WITH
TIME
AND
EXPEDIENCY
BUT
LAZY
TENDS
TO
BE
HIGHER
ON
THE
LIST
FOR
NONWHITE
PLAYERS
AT
LEAST
IN
MY
SUBJECTIVE
OPINION
ASIDE
IT
MIGHT
BE
INTERESTING
FOR
SOMEBODY
TO
DO
AN
ARCHIVAL
STUDY
ON
PLAYER
DESCRIPTIONS
BEFORE
AND
AFTER
THE
COLOR
BARRIER
WAS
BROKEN
AND
ON
TEAMS
LIKE
THE
RED
SOX
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
TRADITIONALLY
WHITE
NOWADAYS
MOST
PEOPLE
THINK
OF
CARL
YASTRZEMSKI
AS
ONE
OF
THOSE
BLUECOLLAR
HARDWORKING
GUYS
BUT
IN
THE
EARLY
HE
WAS
OFTEN
PORTRAYED
AS
A
LAZY
BUM
REALLY
HMM
I
NEVER
HEARD
ANYONE
ACCUSE
CANSECO
OF
BEING
LAZY
NOR
SIERRA
IVE
HEARD
ACCUSATIONS
THAT
CANSECO
WAS
A
BAD
FIELDER
BUT
COULD
BE
A
GREAT
ONE
IF
HE
PUT
HIS
MIND
TO
IT
IGNORING
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HE
IS
A
ACTUALLY
DAVE
STEWART
IS
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
VOCAL
ABOUT
THIS
IN
ANY
EVENT
THAT
IS
NOT
LAZY
AT
LEAST
ONE
POSTER
IN
THE
LAST
WEEK
HAS
FIRED
OFF
A
MAJOR
SCREED
ON
THE
CANSECOISLAZY
ISSUE
SO
I
THINK
YOUR
POINT
IS
AT
BEST
A
QUIBBLE
AND
PROBABLY
WEAKER
THAN
THAT
UH
THAT
POSTER
SPECIFICALLY
STATED
ALLOW
ME
TO
BE
THE
FIRST
IT
IS
NOT
A
QUIBBLE
THEN
TO
STATE
THAT
THE
MEDIA
DID
NOT
PORTRAY
CANSECO
AS
BEING
LAZY
IF
THE
OTHER
PERSON
CHOOSES
TO
SO
ACCUSE
HIM
AFTER
MY
POST
THAT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
IT
A
QUIBBLE
AND
IN
FACT
THE
MEDIA
AROUND
HERE
TENDED
TO
PLAY
UP
HIS
TIME
IN
THE
WIEGHT
ROOM
HARDLY
LAZY
AND
HARDLY
A
QUIBBLE
HAVE
YOU
EVER
SEEN
ANY
MEDIOT
PORTRAY
CANSECO
AS
LAZY
UNCONCERNED
WITH
HIS
FIELDING
YES
LAZY
NO
BAD
FIELDER
I
THINK
THIS
IS
STILL
INTERESTING
FOR
THAT
MATTER
I
THINK
CANSECOS
COLORFUL
OFFFIELD
ANTICS
GET
LOTS
MORE
NATIONAL
ATTENTION
THAN
THOSE
OF
SAY
ROGER
CLEMENS
WELL
HES
HAD
A
FEW
MORE
OF
THEM
AT
LEAST
MORE
THAT
YOUVE
HEARD
ABOUT
I
THINK
ONE
OF
THE
QUESTIONS
HERE
SURROUNDS
SELECTIVE
REPORTING
HAVING
SAID
THAT
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
SELECTIVE
REPORTING
HYPOTHESIS
HAS
THE
POTENTIAL
TO
BE
UNFALSIFIABLE
AT
LEAST
BY
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
ARENT
REPORTERS
POLICE
OR
PRIVATE
INVESTIGATORS
WELL
CANSECO
HAS
BEEN
INVOLVED
IN
SEVERAL
FELONIES
INCLUDING
HIS
HIGHSPEED
RECORD
CARRYING
CONCEALED
FIREARMS
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE
CLEMENS
HAD
A
RUNIN
AT
A
BAR
CANSECO
HAD
THAT
AS
WELL
AND
IN
BOTH
CASES
THE
COVERAGE
WAS
RELATIVELY
MINIMAL
PUCKETT
STEWART
JACKSON
I
SAID
OVERREPRESENT
NONWHITES
THREE
ANECDOTAL
DATA
POINTS
DONT
MAKE
AN
INTERESTING
COUNTERARGUMENT
BTWWHICH
JACKSON
ARE
WE
TALKING
ABOUT
HERE
REGGIE
BO
DARRIN
DANNY
OR
UH
IF
THE
ONLY
EVIDENCE
OFFERED
IS
ANECDOTAL
HOW
CAN
IT
BE
OBJECTED
THAT
THE
COUNTER
TO
IT
IS
ALSO
ANECDOTAL
AND
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
EVERYBODY
WHO
HAS
EVER
WON
A
BATTING
TITLE
AMONG
OTHERS
HAS
BEEN
ACCUSED
AT
SOME
TIME
OF
CARING
MORE
FOR
HIS
OWN
STATS
THAN
FOR
THE
GOOD
OF
THE
TEAM
IT
ALSO
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOURE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
I
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
THIS
ACCUSATION
MADE
OF
PUCKETT
I
HAVE
HEARD
IT
OF
BOGGS
ACTUALLY
I
BELIEVE
IT
OF
HIM
BUT
THATS
ANOTHER
MATTER
NOT
LIVING
IN
MINNESOTA
I
CANT
SAY
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THIS
LINE
HAS
EVER
BEEN
USED
AGAINST
KIRBY
THERE
AS
FAR
AS
BOGGS
GOES
IM
NOT
SURE
WHY
YOU
BRING
HIM
UP
SINCE
HES
ONE
OF
THE
OBVIOUS
PROTOTYPES
FOR
THE
LINE
I
QUOTED
ALONG
WITH
TED
WILLIAMS
ROD
CAREW
AND
MANY
OTHERS
UH
YES
AND
I
AGREE
WITH
YOUR
ASSESMENT
OF
BOGGS
RATHER
SPECIFICALLY
HOWEVER
YOU
DID
SAY
EVERYBODY
WHO
HAS
EVER
WON
A
BATTING
TITLE
HAS
BEEN
ACCUSED
OF
SELFISHNESS
I
HAVE
NOT
EVER
ANYWHERE
HEARD
THIS
SAID
OF
PUCKETT
PENDLETON
EITHER
SIMILARLY
BRETT
B
WILLIAMS
AND
OTHERS
HOW
ABOUT
DARYL
STRAWBERRY
AND
I
THINK
THE
PLUS
OR
MINUS
REFERS
MORE
TO
THE
BORN
AGAIN
TYPES
IE
BUTLER
AND
GAETTI
AGAIN
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
MAKING
AN
ARGUMENT
FROM
ANECDOTES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MY
ARGUMENT
BY
IS
OF
THE
BECAUSEJONSAYSSO
VARIETY
IF
WE
HAVE
NO
OTHER
DATA
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
I
HAVE
PROBLEMS
GENERATING
LISTS
OF
NONWHITE
PLAYERS
WHO
BECAME
INFAMOUS
FOR
THEIR
RELIGIOUS
OR
POLITICAL
BELIEFS
WHILE
NAMES
LIKE
BUTLER
GAETTI
DRAVECKY
KNEPPER
HERSHEISER
ET
AL
COME
ROLLING
OUT
THERE
ARE
OTHERS
PERHAPS
THEY
ARE
SIMPLY
NOT
AS
OUTSPOKEN
EXCEPT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
BORNAGAIN
TYPES
I
MENTION
MIKE
