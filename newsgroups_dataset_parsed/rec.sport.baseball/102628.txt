NEW
UNIFORMS
USUALLY
ONE
OR
TWO
TEAMS
CHANGES
THEIR
LOGO
OR
A
MINOR
UNIFORM
CHANGE
PER
SEASON
BUT
THE
PAST
FEW
SEASONS
HAVE
BEEN
INCREDIBLE
ANY
THOUGHTS
ON
THE
NEW
OLD
REDS
UNIFORMS
I
REMEMBER
SEEING
A
PETE
ROSE
ROOKIE
CARD
AND
UNLESS
I
MISS
MY
GUESS
HE
WAS
WEARING
THE
EXACT
SAME
DUDS
THE
METS
HOW
ABOUT
DOCS
PERFORMANCE
TODAY
HAVE
REINSERTED
THE
METS
PATCH
ON
THE
SHOULDER
AND
CHANGED
THE
METS
INSGNIA
ON
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
JERSEY
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
IT
IS
THE
FIRST
TIME
THAT
HAS
BEEN
CHANGED
SINCE
AND
IT
REMINDS
ME
A
LITTLE
OF
THE
DODGER
LOGO
MANY
TEAMS
HAVE
OPTED
FOR
A
RETURN
TO
A
PREVIOUS
STYLE
OF
UNIFORM
OR
AT
LEAST
UNIFORMS
THAT
LOOK
MORE
TRADITIONAL
PHILLIES
REDS
EXPOS
WHITE
SOX
PADRES
ETC
AND
THE
ONCE
BRIGHT
COLORS
HAVE
BEEN
ALTERED
TO
GRAY
THE
TREND
HAS
ALSO
SEEN
THE
NEWER
BASEBALL
FIELDS
RESEMBLING
THE
PARKS
OF
THE
EARLY
YEARS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
COOKIECUTTER
SAUCER
STADIUMS
CONSTRUCRTED
THROUGHOUT
THE
SIXTIES
WITH
SALARIES
NOW
REACHING
UNBELIEVABLE
HIGHS
NO
ONE
IN
THE
COMISSIONERS
OFFICE
AND
INTERLEAGUE
PLAY
ON
THE
HORIZON
ITS
NICE
TO
SEE
THAT
BASEBALL
AT
LEAST
LOOKS
LIKE
IT
WAS
MEANT
TO
BE
