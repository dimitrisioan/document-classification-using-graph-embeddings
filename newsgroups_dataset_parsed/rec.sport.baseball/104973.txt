ive
been
a
braves
fan
for
as
long
as
ive
been
watching
baseball
almost
years
now
i
say
that
just
tp
preface
what
im
about
to
post
this
braves
team
is
made
up
of
slow
starters
people
are
amazed
that
the
braves
arent
hitting
dont
be
they
werent
hitting
last
year
at
this
time
nor
were
they
the
year
before
they
had
slow
aprils
and
mays
in
the
and
seasons
and
yet
they
still
managed
to
go
to
the
series
in
those
years
well
this
team
is
no
different
so
why
should
we
be
suprised
at
their
slow
start
they
started
that
way
for
the
past
two
years
and
theyll
be
that
way
until
the
richmond
club
makes
it
to
the
majors
judge
their
offense
in
june
or
july
when
things
start
to
average
out
im
just
happy
that
the
reds
have
gotten
off
to
such
a
poor
start
the
giants
always
do
well
in
the
early
part
of
the
season
but
theyll
be
out
of
the
race
by
july
just
like
the
last
few
years
unless
bonds
developes
a
knuckelball
their
staff
will
get
rocked
by
midjune
wow
you
really
know
how
to
hurt
a
guy
guess
i
shouldnt
bother
watching
any
more
games
its
already
been
decided
