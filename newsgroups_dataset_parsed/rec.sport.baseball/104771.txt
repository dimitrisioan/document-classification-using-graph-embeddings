RE
JACK
MORRIS
IN
ARTICLE
DAVESNITORSNICA
DAVE
TILL
WRITES
I
DONT
THINK
IT
WAS
THAT
OBVIOUS
AT
THE
TIME
THAT
VIOLA
WAS
BETTER
MORRIS
AND
VIOLA
HAD
COMPARABLE
KIP
RATIOS
IN
VIOLA
WAS
COMING
OFF
AN
INJURY
WHEREAS
MORRIS
WAS
HEALTHY
AT
THE
TIME
I
DIDNT
REALLY
WANT
THE
SOX
TO
SIGN
EITHER
I
WAS
MORE
THAN
A
LITTLE
WORRIED
ABOUT
VIOLAS
ELBOW
BUT
YOU
SURELY
REMEMBER
MY
SHOUT
OF
RELIEF
WHEN
AFTER
A
WEEK
OF
RUMORS
THAT
MORRIS
WAS
COMING
TO
THE
RED
SOX
THEY
ENDED
UP
WITH
VIOLA
INSTEAD
NOW
IM
EVEN
HAPPIER
VIOLA
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
REBOUNDED
NICELY
ALSO
MORRIS
WAS
WILLING
TO
SIGN
FOR
ONLY
TWO
YEARS
THE
JAYS
DONT
LIKE
TO
SIGN
PITCHERS
TO
LONGTERM
CONTRACTS
WHICH
I
THINK
IS
A
SENSIBLE
POLICY
HOW
LONG
DID
VIOLA
SIGN
FOR
THREE
YEARS
I
GENERALLY
AGREE
WITH
THEIR
POLICY
OF
AVOIDING
LONGTERM
CONTRACTS
FOR
PITCHERS
BUT
I
THINK
THEY
ENFORCE
IT
RATHER
TOO
STRICTLY
THESE
DAYS
THE
PREMIER
PITCHERS
ALL
SIGN
THREE
OR
FOUR
YEAR
DEALS
WHICH
LEAVES
THE
JAYS
WITH
MORRIS
AND
STEWART
IF
THE
JAYS
WANT
TO
COMPETE
FOR
TOP
FREE
AGENT
PITCHERS
THEY
WILL
HAVE
TO
ACCEPT
GREATER
RISKS
ANY
IDEA
WHAT
THE
OPTION
YEAR
DEAL
IS
FOR
MORRIS
ARE
THERE
ANY
AUTOMATIC
ACTIVATION
CLAUSES
WHAT
IS
THE
BUYOUT
AMOUNTF
CHEERS
VALENTINE
