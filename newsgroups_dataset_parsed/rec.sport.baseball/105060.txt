im
still
hoping
for
a
season
from
the
bucs
but
i
really
wished
they
would
have
coughed
up
the
to
keep
doug
around
actually
i
was
hoping
for
barry
bonds
oh
well
ps
jeff
king
still
sucks
check
this
out
from
the
latest
mcweekly
ba
slg
obp
hr
rbi
jeff
king
jose
lind
first
off
jeff
has
had
like
hits
in
the
last
two
games
and
walked
yet
again
sorry
ken
but
jeff
king
does
have
some
power
which
means
his
slg
wont
be
below
and
his
walks
are
way
up
if
that
increase
is
real
jeff
king
will
be
an
above
average
nl
third
baseman
in
jose
lind
on
the
other
hand
still
doesnt
walk
and
clearly
isnt
a
hitter
my
bet
is
that
he
wont
be
getting
any
extra
bases
either
once
everybody
starts
pulling
the
lind
shift
we
were
seeing
in
the
nl
any
predictions
as
to
when
he
is
sent
to
buffalo
or
released
outright
no
although
since
the
lavalliere
weirdness
nothing
would
really
surprise
me
jeff
king
is
currently
in
the
top
in
the
league
in
walks
something
is
up
jking
