IELDING
RF
OF
ALL
TIME
AS
FAR
AS
ANYONE
CAN
TELL
I
DID
A
QUICK
SCAN
LAST
NIGHT
LOOKING
FOR
PLAYERS
WITH
A
PEAK
COMPARABLE
TO
OR
BETTER
THAN
WINFIELD
IN
MY
QUICKNDIRTY
SUBJECTIVE
JUDGEMENT
YOU
COULD
MAKE
GOOD
CASES
FOR
RUTH
AARON
OTT
ROBINSON
CLEMENTE
KALINE
MARIS
KLEIN
JACKSON
WANER
AND
PROBABLY
A
FEW
OTHERS
THIS
IS
NOT
A
KNOCK
ON
WINFIELD
BUT
A
COMMENT
ON
HIS
CONSISTENCY
ALL
OF
THOSE
OTHER
PLAYERS
HAD
AWESOME
STRETCHES
AND
VERY
GOOD
STRETCHES
WHILE
WINFIELD
HAS
BEEN
MORE
UNIFORMLY
EXCELLENT
HALL
OF
FAME
ABSOLUTELY
PEAK
IM
NOT
SO
SURE
TOP
TOTAL
CAREER
VALUE
YES
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
POINT
TAKEN
WHEN
WAS
WINFIELDS
PEAK
YEARS
ANYWAY
PROBABLY
AROUND
THATS
THE
TROUBLE
WHAT
PEAK
YEARS
HE
WAVERS
BETWEEN
EXCELLENT
AND
VERY
GOOD
WITH
NO
REAL
BELLSHAPED
PATTERN
IN
THERE
WAS
A
FINE
YEAR
AND
WERE
MERELY
REALLY
GOOD
WITH
THE
YANKEES
I
THINK
WAS
THE
BEST
THAT
WAS
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
BA
OF
COURSE
WASNT
BAD
EITHER
HES
BEEN
IN
THE
BIGS
SINCE
WITH
A
ONEYEAR
INTERMISSION
FOR
SURGERY
THOUGH
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
THE
MIX
OF
SKILLS
THAT
PETE
ROSE
DID
HES
LIKE
PETE
ROSE
IN
ONE
WAY
HES
NOT
A
NATURAL
HITTER
WINFIELDS
SWING
USED
TO
BE
THE
UGLIEST
THING
IN
NEW
YORK
AND
THAT
INCLUDES
THE
GULFWESTERN
BUILDING
BUT
HIS
SHEER
ATHLETIC
PROWESS
AND
PHYSICAL
SIZE
MADE
UP
FOR
A
LOT
FASCINATING
PLAYER
TO
WATCH
EVEN
NOW
NOT
OBVIOUSLY
GREAT
IN
ANY
ONE
WAY
BUT
ABLE
TO
DO
QUITE
A
FEW
THINGS
IN
SURPRISING
WAYS
AND
AT
SURPRISING
LEVELS
