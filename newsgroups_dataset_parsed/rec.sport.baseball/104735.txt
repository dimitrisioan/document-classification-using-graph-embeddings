being
an
old
time
cardinal
fannow
relocated
to
the
nva
areai
can
recall
that
harry
was
not
at
all
popular
with
old
man
busch
who
as
i
understand
it
fired
him
and
kicked
him
out
of
st
louis
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
the
reasons
but
the
old
man
was
certainly
not
enraptured
by
ole
harry
but
maybe
his
wife
was
i
dont
claim
to
know
whether
its
true
or
not
but
a
couple
different
people
totally
unrelated
have
said
harry
was
relieved
of
his
duties
because
he
had
more
than
platonic
relations
with
augie
buschs
wife
judgement
is
left
to
the
individual
cuz
i
sure
dont
claim
to
be
an
impeachable
