astros
relief
corps
holding
together
if
doug
jones
keeps
his
changeup
effective
and
xavier
hernandez
can
be
effective
then
its
passable
theres
no
reasonable
lefthanded
help
and
the
middle
relief
is
iffy
tom
edens
was
expected
to
take
over
the
joe
boever
setup
man
role
but
hes
been
injured
and
he
was
an
expansion
team
acquisition
anyway
houston
thought
that
boever
would
demand
too
much
money
so
they
let
him
go
doug
jones
can
lose
his
touch
he
went
from
clevelands
allstar
closer
to
the
minors
in
a
pretty
short
span
from
what
i
understand
boever
and
murphy
were
considered
expendable
by
the
club
houston
felt
that
their
positions
could
be
filled
by
a
number
of
players
art
doug
jones
is
the
key
to
houstons
success
he
must
have
another
great
year
for
houston
to
challenge
in
the
nl
west
no
argument
at
all
with
murphy
he
scared
the
hell
out
of
me
when
he
came
in
last
year
on
the
other
hand
the
club
though
enough
of
boever
to
put
him
into
an
awful
lot
of
games
he
may
have
led
the
league
in
appearances
he
did
at
least
at
some
point
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
viable
setup
guy
but
i
guess
thats
not
considered
that
crucial
by
the
club
i
can
just
remember
two
years
ago
so
well
though
the
unsuspected
strength
of
the
lower
part
of
the
order
has
saved
the
club
so
far
biggio
and
finley
just
arent
doing
their
job
of
getting
on
base
instead
of
filling
his
role
as
an
rbi
man
bagwell
has
had
to
assume
biggio
and
finleys
job
biggio
concerns
me
since
he
usually
starts
the
season
very
strong
im
not
that
concerned
those
guys
have
been
relatively
consistent
over
the
years
and
they
have
no
good
reasons
to
decline
no
injuries
not
old
i
expect
them
to
come
through
just
fine
its
those
guys
that
have
not
been
consistently
good
that
are
the
worrisome
part
even
if
they
are
coming
through
right
now
on
a
side
note
are
you
at
all
concerned
with
the
rumors
concerning
next
years
uniform
there
is
talk
that
their
road
uniform
will
be
blech
traditional
grey
with
the
word
houston
written
across
the
chest
if
im
not
mistaken
their
home
uniforms
may
totally
eliminate
the
color
orange
shiver
mclanes
favorite
color
is
red
so
this
sounds
like
their
old
road
unis
pretty
dull
buttons
or
pullovers
ill
check
through
my
uniform
book
to
see
if
theyve
always
had
some
orange
im
really
upset
the
current
unforms
are
dull
and
the
new
ones
sound
horrible
id
like
to
see
the
uniform
of
the
return
they
may
not
have
been
pretty
but
houston
had
established
a
long
precident
of
wearing
the
ugliest
uniforms
in
baseball
and
i
liked
it
well
well
see
ive
got
a
astros
pullover
shirt
with
the
astros
stripes
across
the
shoulders
and
i
have
trouble
making
myself
wear
it
in
public
i
can
see
why
they
might
want
that
to
change
gee
if
they
eliminate
the
orange
will
they
reupholster
the
seats
in
the
astros
stripes
section
what
used
to
be
the
gold
and
yellow
levels
i
dont
know
those
numbers
they
use
now
i
saw
a
pinstripe
version
of
an
astros
cap
and
i
actually
thought
it
looked
good
