was
are
they
still
officially
if
so
why

how
did
they
receive
this
label
probably
because
everyone
that
is
everyone
who
has
cable
can
watch
every
braves
game
they
are
the
only
team
that
has
all
of
its
games
broadcast
nationwide
and
if
you
dont
like
your
local
team
or
you
dont
have
a
local
team
the
braves
can
kind
of
become
your
local
team
because
you
can
watch
them
every
day
