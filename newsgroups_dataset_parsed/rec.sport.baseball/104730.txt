ERIC
ROUSH
WRITES
SINCE
TIME
IMMEMORIAL
BATTERS
HAVE
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
CALLS
SO
HAVE
PITCHERS
AND
CATCHERS
HOWEVER
BATTERS
DIDNT
USE
TO
GO
FOR
STROLLS
AFTER
BAD
CALLS
TO
THE
DEGREE
THEY
DO
NOW
I
REALLY
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
KEY
POINT
WHEN
I
SAW
THE
INCIDENT
ON
BASEBALL
TONIGHT
SUNDAY
I
COULDNT
BELIEVE
HOW
FAR
AWAY
FROM
THE
PLATE
GANT
WENT
THEN
HE
CASUALLY
LEANED
AGAINST
HIS
BAT
I
DONT
BLAME
THE
UMPIRE
AT
ALL
FOR
TELLING
THE
PITCHER
TO
PITCH
THE
WORST
PART
OF
THE
WHOLE
INCIDENT
WAS
THE
BRAVES
COMING
OUT
ONTO
THE
FIELD
WHAT
WERE
THEY
GOING
TO
DO
ATTACK
THE
UMPIRE
THE
ONLY
PEOPLE
WHO
SHOULDVE
BEEN
OUT
THERE
WERE
COX
AND
MAYBE
THE
COACHES
BUT
NO
PLAYERS
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
PERSON
WHO
POSTED
BEFORE
THAT
COX
SHOULD
BE
SUSPENDED
FOR
HAVING
NO
CONTROL
OVER
HIS
TEAM
