RE
PHILS
NL
EAST

SO
WEAK
IN
APANJABIGUVAXACCGEORGETOWNEDU
WRITES
I
LOVE
IT
HOW
ALL
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
BLAMING
THE
PHILLIES
SUCCESS
ON
A
WEAK
DIVISION
WHY
DONT
WE
LOOK
AT
THE
RECORD
OF
THE
TEAMS
IN
EACH
DIVISION
READ
INTERDIVISIONAL
PLAY
WELL
SEE
THAT
THE
EAST
IS
REALLY
KICKING
THE
SHIT
OUT
OF
THE
WEST
I
KNOW
IT
IS
EARLY
BUT
THAT
IS
ALL
WE
HAVE
TO
GO
ON
ATLANTA

JUST
SO
STRONG
WITH
THEIR
BA
CINCINNATI
IS
COMING
OFF
A
SWEEP
AT
VETERANS
STADIUM
IN
PHILADELPHIA

HOUSTON
WAS
SWEPT
IN
ITS
FIRST
THREE
GAMES
BY
THE
PHILLIES
IN
THE
ASTRODOME
THAT
MY
WESTERN
DIVISION
FRIENDS
SHOWS
THAT
THE
THREE
BEST
TEAMS
IN
YOUR
DIVISION
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
STRONG
AS
YOU
THINK
OR
YOU
MAY
BE
POSTING
THIS
WAY
TOO
EARLY
AND
BE
EATING
YOUR
WORDS
BY
MIDSEASON
CMON
THE
PHILLIES
HAVENT
PROVED
ANYTHING
YET
ATLANTA
WAS
SIMILAR
TO
THE
PHILS
YEARS
AGO
THEY
SUCKED
THEY
STARTED
HAVING
A
GOOD
YEAR
BUT
DIDNT
GET
ANY
RESPECT
UNTIL
THEY
ACTUALLY
WON
THE
DIVISION
WHICH
IS
HOW
IT
SHOULD
BE
SO
UNTIL
THE
PHILS
AT
LEAST
HAVE
A
GOOD
YEAR
NOT
JUST
A
GOOD
WEEKS
THEY
WONT
GET
ANY
RESPECT
EITHER

ACTUALLY
A
COMPLIMENT
