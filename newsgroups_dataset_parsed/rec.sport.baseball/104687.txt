SHERRI
NICHOLS
WRITES
HAVENT
BEEN
TO
MANY
AS
GAMES
HAVE
YOU
THERES
ALSO
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
HOW
TOLERANT
I
AM
OF
LONG
GAMES
IF
IM
WATCHING
THEM
ON
THE
TUBE
AND
IF
IM
GOING
THERE
IN
PERSON
FOR
ME
GOING
TO
AN
AS
GAME
HAS
BECOME
A
MAJOR
COMMITMENT
OF
TIME
ONE
THAT
IM
NOT
WILLING
TO
MAKE
THAT
OFTEN
THE
LENGTH
OF
THEIR
GAMES
IS
COSTING
THE
AS
REVENUE
FROM
ME
I
STOPPED
GOING
TO
AS
GAMES
SOME
YEARS
AGO
WHILE
I
STILL
LIVED
INTHE
BAY
AREA
FOR
EXACTLY
THIS
REASON
I
BELIEVE
THE
LENGTH
OF
THEIR
GAMES
HAS
BEEN
INSTITUTIONALIZED
BY
LARUSSADUNCAN
THEY
ENCOURAGE
THEIR
PITCHERS
TO
BE
OVERLY
DELIBERATE
TO
THROW
TO
FIRST
OFTEN
TO
STUDY
THE
CATCHERS
SIGNALS
AND
SO
ON
AND
ALMOST
EVERY
AS
HITTER
TAKES
A
STEP
OUT
OF
THE
BOX
AFTER
EVERY
PITCH
THIS
IS
NOT
IMO
A
COINCIDENCE
THIS
IS
PLANNED
AND
I
HATE
IT
AS
FOR
THE
GANT
SITUATION
I
DID
NOT
SEE
THE
GAME
OR
THE
REPLAYS
BUT
I
DO
WONDER
WHAT
IF
GANT
HAD
REQUESTED
A
TIME
OUT
WOULD
HIRSCHBECK
HAVE
BEEN
REQUIRED
TO
GIVE
IT
TO
HIM
COULD
HE
HAVE
DENIED
THE
REQUST
FOR
ALL
HE
THE
UMP
KNEW
GANT
COULD
HAVE
HAD
DIRT

HIS
EYE
