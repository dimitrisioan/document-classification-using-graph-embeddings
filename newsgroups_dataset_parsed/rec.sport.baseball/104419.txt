MR
HERNANDEZ
Ñ
I
APOLOGIZE
FOR
THE
MISUNDERSTANDING
I
EXPLAINED
THAT
I
KNOW
THAT
IT
IS
ESSENTIAL
FOR
SOME
FANS
TO
GET
SCORES
HERE
FOR
THEY
CANNOT
GET
THEM
ELSEWHERE
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
WHAT
YOU
DO
POSTING
SCORES
AFTER
THE
GAMES
HAVE
BEEN
COMPLETED
HOWEVER
LIKE
I
SAID
EARLIER
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
A
NECESSITY
TO
POST
SCORES
DURING
THE
MIDDLE
OF
GAMES
LIKE
SOME
OTHERS
HAVE
COME
TO
PRACTICE
SEAN
