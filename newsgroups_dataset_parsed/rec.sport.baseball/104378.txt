are
you
for
real
how
many
gold
gloves
does
ozzie
smith
have
if
a
guy
hung
around
and
hit
homers
a
year
for
years
wouldnt
he
be
a
given
for
the
hall
is
defense
not
just
as
important
frankly
no
offense
and
defense
are
equally
important
but
the
pitcher
is
of
the
defense
the
primary
role
of
every
other
player
is
on
offense
even
shortstops
are
a
bigger
part
of
the
offensive
game
than
of
the
defensive
game
they
might
not
do
much
with
their
part
of
the
offense
but
thats
another
issue
that
being
said
i
think
both
smith
and
yount
deserve
the
hof
they
hit
pretty
well
in
addition
to
their
defense
