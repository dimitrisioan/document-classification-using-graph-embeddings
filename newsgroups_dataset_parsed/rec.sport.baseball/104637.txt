RE
JACK
MORRIS
IN
ARTICLE
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
WE
CANNOT
ISOLATE
THE
TOTAL
CONTRIBUTION
THAT
ANY
PLAYER
AT
ANY
POSITION
MAKES
TO
HIS
TEAMS
VICTORY
AND
SINCE
WE
CANNOT
MAKE
THAT
MEASURE
WITH
COMPLETE
CONFIDENCE
OF
OBJECTIVITY
AND
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
REASON
TO
MAKE
THAT
KIND
OF
SUBJECTIVE
MEASUREMENT
I
SUBMIT
TO
YOU
THAT
IT
IS
POINTLESS
IF
A
GM
IS
TRYING
TO
PUT
TOGETHER
A
WINNING
TEAM
HE
MIGHT
CONSIDER
ERA
HE
MIGHT
CONSIDER
ATTITUDE
HE
MIGHT
CONSIDER
PAST
PERFORMANCE
IN
KEY
SITUATIONS
BUT
WHAT
HE
IS
LOOKING
FOR
IS
NOT
THE
PLAYER
THAT
HE
CONSIDERS
THE
BEST
THE
GM
IS
LOOKING
FOR
THE
PLAYER
HE
THINKS
CAN
HELP
HIS
TEAM
WIN
WE
CANNOT
ISOLATE
COMPLETELY
ROGER
BUT
WE
CAN
MAKE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
ESTIMATE
I
WONT
CLAIM
TO
SPLIT
HAIRS
AND
SAY
THAT
WE
CAN
REALLY
MEASURE
WHO
WAS
BETTER
ROBBY
ALOMAR
OR
CARLOS
BAERGA
LAST
YEAR
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
TOO
CLOSE
TO
CALL
BUT
LARKIN
AND
LEE
CLEMENS
AND
MORRIS
THE
DIFFERENCES
ARE
TOO
GREAT
THERE
IN
YOUR
MEASURE
OF
THE
GAME
WHY
SHOULD
A
TEAM
THAT
HAS
JUST
WON
IT
ALL
EVER
REPLACE
A
SINGLE
PLAYER
SINCE
THEY
ARE
NOW
CLEARLY
BEST
HOW
CAN
THEY
DO
BETTER
YET
EVERY
TEAM
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
SOMEPLACE
WHERE
THEY
BELEIVE
THEY
CAN
IMPROVE
THE
TEAM
THEY
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
A
PLAYER
A
LITTLE
BETTER
THAN
ONE
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
BTW
BY
MY
DEFINITIONS
THE
BEST
PLAYER
IS
THE
ONE
WHO
DOES
THE
MOST
THINGS
TO
HELP
HIS
TEAM
WIN
I
WILL
ALLOW
THAT
THIS
COULD
VARY
DEPENDING
ON
WHO
ELSE
IS
ON
THE
TEAM
BY
HAVING
APTITUDES
ONE
TEAM
NEEDS
MORE
THAN
OTHERS
BASEBALL
IS
A
TEAM
GAME
BUT
IT
IS
MADE
OF
INDIVIDUAL
TALENTS
IT
IS
ABSURD
TO
JUDGE
THE
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
BY
THE
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
OF
HIS
TEAMMATES
WHOM
HE
DID
NOT
CHOOSE
AT
LEAST
IN
MOST
CASES
MORRIS
WON
LAST
YEAR
BECAUSE
HE
PLAYED
ON
A
TEAM
WITH
JOE
CARTER
ROBBY
ALOMAR
TOM
HENKE
JUAN
GUZMAN
JOHN
OLERUD
ET
AL
CLEMENS
LOST
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
SURROUNDED
BY
SUCH
LESSER
PERFORMERS
AS
HERM
WINNINHAM
LUIS
RIVERA
AND
JEFF
REARDON
TO
DEFINE
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
TEAM
AS
A
SUM
OF
ITS
COMPONENTS
AS
I
DO
ALBEIT
IMPERFECTLY
IS
A
LESSER
ERROR
THAN
DEFINING
THE
QUALITY
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
AS
THE
MEAN
QUALITY
OF
THE
TEAM
AS
MY
READING
OF
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
SUGGESTS
YOU
DO
