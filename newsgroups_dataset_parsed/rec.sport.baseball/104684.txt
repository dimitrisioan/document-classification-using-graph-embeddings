yankee
thoughts
yes
everyone
seems
to
be
in
agreement
that
the
yankees
are
finally
moving
in
the
right
direction
they
should
finish
over
this
year
and
maybe
even
be
in
the
pennent
race
in
august
however
i
would
take
back
a
few
moves
the
jim
abbott
trade
i
think
abbott
is
not
only
an
inspirational
person
but
a
great
pitcher
also
he
could
win
the
cy
young
this
year
but
he
wont
because
the
right
side
of
the
yanks
infield
isnt
good
enough
so
why
was
this
not
a
good
trade
jt
snow
how
many
rookies
have
been
able
to
step
in
and
immediately
have
the
impact
that
he
has
had
so
far
on
the
angels
i
know
its
early
but
if
youve
seen
this
kid
hit
field
or
talk
you
can
just
tell
that
he
is
going
to
be
a
tremendous
player
the
yanks
should
have
kept
him
what
about
mattingly
you
ask
well
its
great
that
the
yanks
have
taken
care
of
him
and
remained
loyal
but
hes
years
older
than
snow
and
just
doesnt
have
the
same
bat
speed
as
before
his
back
injury
its
a
shame
but
as
a
yankee
fan
who
wants
to
see
the
best
yankee
team
id
take
snow
over
mattingly
at
first
the
yanks
also
gave
up
two
promising
propects
with
snow
for
abbott
besides
with
domingo
jean
brien
taylor
wickman
militello
and
sterling
hitchcock
they
are
just
loaded
with
propects
i
know
abbotts
only
but
this
was
too
much
to
give
up
i
believe
george
forced
this
trade
because
he
believes
and
hes
right
that
abbott
will
be
a
big
hit
in
ny
however
id
like
to
see
the
yankees
build
a
baseball
team
not
an
amusement
show
wade
boggs
i
live
in
boston
and
like
wade
a
lot
but
his
career
is
winding
down
and
i
would
rather
see
the
yanks
start
to
develop
a
long
term
solution
ie
hensley
muelins
russ
davis
velarde
besides
wade
just
doesnt
have
any
range
what
a
shame
about
charlie
hayes
huh
spike
owen
see
wade
boggs
id
much
rather
see
them
develop
dave
silvestri
or
whoever
wade
and
spike
next
to
each
other
in
the
infield
is
going
to
raise
the
yankee
staff
era
point
and
these
guys
are
on
the
down
sides
of
their
careers
danny
tartabull
yes
hes
put
up
some
tremendous
numbers
and
its
nice
to
think
about
what
he
could
do
if
he
were
ever
healthy
all
year
but
he
never
is
we
should
expect
games
max
out
of
him
meanwhile
gerald
williams
is
playing
at
columbus
and
paul
oneil
is
playing
left
field
i
believe
oneil
led
nl
outfielders
in
assists
last
year
and
tartabull
is
a
poor
defensive
outfielder
what
im
basically
getting
at
is
the
yanks
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
but
are
not
ready
to
win
a
pennent
this
year
they
should
at
the
gm
level
be
planning
for
a
or
world
series
this
means
getting
the
younger
players
experience
in
the
majors
now
so
they
will
be
ready
in
a
year
or
two
im
afraid
that
all
this
stuff
wreaks
of
george
steinbrenner
certainly
the
boggs
deal
was
all
george
it
looks
like
george
is
planning
the
right
mix
of
veterans
and
young
players
to
win
a
world
series
now
the
veterans
are
always
available
and
can
be
added
at
any
time
like
boston
did
this
year
develop
the
young
players
first
then
add
the
one
or
two
veterans
or
in
the
yankees
case
just
keep
them
lets
all
us
yankee
fans
hope
that
george
doesnt
dismantle
the
terrific
job
stick
and
company
have
done
building
the
yankee
organization
back
into
one
of
respect
im
really
afraid
that
he
will
trade
whoever
it
takes
to
patch
holes
today
relief
pitching
for
example
george
must
realize
that
the
yankees
rebuilding
process
is
still
one
or
two
years
away
have
patience
george
and
we
will
all
enjoy
the
future
fire
bucky
and
trade
the
kids
and
its
baseball
hell
for
all
loyal
yankee
fans
for
a
long
time
sam
im
not
militello
or
millitello
mandelbaum
