RE
JACK
MORRIS
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
WE
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
BECAUSE
WE
CANNOT
SEPARATE
MORRIS
CONTRIBU
TION
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
TEAMS
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
WAY
OF
DETERMIN
ING
BEST
IN
BASEBALL
AND
THAT
IS
BY
LOOKING
AT
THE
SCOREBOARD
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
GAME
EACH
GAME
DETERMINES
WHICH
TEAM
IS
THE
BEST
THAT
DAY
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
THE
TEAM
THAT
WAS
THE
BEST
THE
MOST
OFTEN
IS
THE
BEST
IN
THE
DIVISION
THE
PLAYOFFS
DETERMINE
THE
BEST
OF
THE
BEST
BUT
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THE
ONLY
DECISION
MAKING
PRO
CESS
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
BEST
IS
THE
SCORE
OF
THE
GAME
AND
IT
RE
LATES
TO
THE
TEAMS
NOT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PLAYERS
THERE
IS
NO
METHOD
INHERENT
IN
BASEBALL
OF
COMPARING
INDIVIDUAL
PERFORMANCES
AND
THAT
IS
HOW
IT
SHOULD
BE
BECAUSE
AFTER
ALL
BASEBALL
IS
A
TEAM
GAME
AND
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
METHOD
INHERENT
IN
REAL
LIFE
EITHER
SO
I
WOULD
ASSUME
YOU
WOULD
ENDORSE
THE
NOTION
THAT
WE
CANNOT
STATE
WITH
ANY
LEVEL
OF
OBJECTIVITY
THAT
MOTHER
THERESA
HAS
ACCOMPLISHED
MORE
GOOD
IN
THIS
WORLD
THAN
JOSEPH
STALIN
AFTER
ALL
LIFE
ON
EARTH
IS
A
TEAM
EFFORT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
SELECT
A
GROUP
OF
STATISTICS
AND
CLAIM
THAT
CLEMENS
HAS
DONE
BETTER
WITH
THOSE
STATISTICS
AS
A
CRITERIA
THEN
FINE
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
PROVE
THAT
THOSE
STATISTICS
MEASURE
THE
INDIVIDUALS
CONTRIBUTION
TO
WINNING
THE
WS
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
ONLY
MEASURE
OF
BEST
THAT
HAS
ANY
MEANING
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
BASE
BALL
SO
UNTIL
YOU
CAN
PROVE
THAT
CLEMENS
CONTRIBUTES
TO
A
WS
CHAM
PIONSHIP
MORE
THAN
MORRIS
YOUR
EVALUATION
OF
CLEMENS
IS
TOTALLY
SUB
JECTIVE
AND
IS
MERE
OPINION
I
HAVE
YET
TO
SEE
THAT
ANY
OF
YOU
CAN
PREDICT
A
WS
WINNER
WITH
ANY
GREATER
ACCURACY
THAN
JEANNE
DIXON
HAVE
YOU
TRIED
GLASSES
I
FIND
THEM
QUITE
USEFUL
AFTER
ALL
THERE
MUST
BE
SOME
REASON
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
IGNORE
THE
MOUNDS
OF
EVIDENCE
WE
PRESENT
ITS
TOO
BAD
YOU
FEEL
IT
NECESSARY
TO
CLOSE
YOUR
MIND
AND
EYES
TO
KNOWLEDGE
YOU
LIVE
A
POORER
LIFE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THAT
CHOICE
HECK
ID
WAGER
THAT
YOU
COULD
PREDICT
A
WS
WINNER
WITH
GREATER
ACCURACY
THAN
JEANNE
DIXON
AND
YOU
KNOW
WHY
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
FULL
CONFIDENCE
THAT
DESPITE
YOUR
PROTESTATIONS
TO
THE
CONTRARY
YOU
ARE
QUITE
CAPABLE
OF
USING
THE
KNOWLEDGE
WE
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
THROUGH
STATISTICAL
METHODS
TO
BOOST
YOUR
KNOWLEDGE
LEVEL
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
BE
RUDE
HAVE
YOU
TRIED
CALLING
A
KETTLE
BLACK
FOR
YOU
TO
SAY
THAT
MEANS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
EITHER
MISSED
THE
ENTIRE
POINT
OF
MY
ARGUMENT
OR
YOU
YOURSELF
HAVE
COMMITTED
A
FALLACY
IGNORATIO
ELENCHI
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
MORRIS
IS
BETTER
THAN
CLEMENS
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
MORE
RINGS
ALTHOUGH
I
HAVE
TONGUE
IN
CHEEK
CLAIMED
THAT
IN
THE
PAST
I
AM
SAYING
THAT
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ISOLATE
AN
INDIVIDUALS
PERFORMANCE
FROM
THAT
OF
HIS
TEAMS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
COMPARING
THAT
INDIVIDUALS
PERFORMANCE
WITH
ANOTHER
INDIVIDUALS
PER
FORMANCE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IN
YOUR
WORLD
YOU
CANNOT
OBJECTIVELY
STATE
THAT
JACK
MORRIS
WAS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
THE
BLUE
JAYS
THAN
AL
LEITER
LAST
YEAR
IN
YOUR
WORLD
THAT
MAY
INDEED
BE
TRUE
FORTUNATELY
IN
THE
WORLD
THE
REST
OF
US
OCCUPY
ITS
NOT
I
HOPE
YOU
NEVER
SERVE
ON
A
JURY
ROGER
I
THINK
THE
REST
OF
THE
JURY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
KILL
YOU
THERES
NO
WAY
I
CAN
OBJECTIVELY
JUDGE
THE
DEFENDANT
TO
BE
INNOCENT
OR
GUILTY
YOU
SEE
THERE
ARE
BILLION
OTHER
PEOPLE
ON
THIS
PLANET
WE
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
WHETHER
THE
DEFENDANT
WOULD
HAVE
COMMITTED
THE
CRIME
IF
IT
WASNT
FOR
ALL
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
ON
THE
PLANET
WE
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
HOW
THE
DEFENDANT
WOULD
HAVE
ACTED
HAD
HE
BEEN
ON
A
DIFFERENT
PLANET
BECAUSE
LIVING
ON
THIS
PLANET
IS
A
TEAM
EFFORT
AND
NO
INDIVIDUAL
COMMITTS
A
CRIME
TOTALLY
ISOLATED
FROM
HIS
SOCIETY
HE
IS
A
PART
OF
THAT
SOCIETY
THAT
BEING
CASE
ANYTHING
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
ON
HIS
CULPABILITY
WOULD
BE
ABSOLUTE
SUBJECTIVITY
SO
I
REFUSE
TO
VOTE
