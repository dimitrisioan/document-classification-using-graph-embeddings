yesterday
april
a
friend
and
i
were
discussing
the
theory
put
forth
by
a
local
sports
radio
station
personality
that
the
commissionerless
baseball
owners
had
snuck
a
live
ball
into
this
years
baseball
games
in
an
effort
to
increase
home
run
numbers
and
attract
fans
its
always
possible
but
if
this
is
the
case
i
think
that
there
is
some
blatant
discrimination
going
on
here
clearly
selig
is
allowing
the
opposition
to
use
baseballs
against
the
dodgers
well
guess
who
stepped
up
to
the
plate
for
his
first
career
grand
slam
last
night
against
the
jays
none
other
than
my
boy
it
was
truly
a
sight
to
behold
and
almost
more
impressive
was
that
he
also
got
an
intentional
walk
we
will
stretch
no
farm
animal
beyond
its
natural
length
