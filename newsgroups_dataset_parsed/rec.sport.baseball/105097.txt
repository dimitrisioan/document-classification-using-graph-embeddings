for

there
are
two
ways
that
a
reliever
can
get
a
save
he
must
finish
the
game
and
either
have
entered
the
game
with
the
tying
run
on
base
at
bat
or
on
deck
have
pitched
at
least
three
innings
effectively
a
pitcher
may
not
get
a
win
and
a
save
in
the
same
game
close
but
theres
a
number
also
have
entered
the
game
with
no
more
than
a
run
lead
and
pitched
at
least
one
inning
if
a
pitcher
finishes
a
game
which
his
team
has
won
does
not
get
the
win
and
satisfies
at
least
one
of
the
three
requirements
he
gets
a
save
