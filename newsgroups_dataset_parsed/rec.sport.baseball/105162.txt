BELOW
IN
THIS
CASE
THE

DECIDED
FOR
WHATEVER
REASON
THAT
THE
INFIELD

RULE
DOESNT
APPLY
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
BAD
CALL
HERE
BUT
THATS
NOT
THE
POINT
THE
BATTER
IS
NOT
OUT
SO
A
FORCE
SITUATION
IS
CREATED
THEREFORE
THE
RUNNER
IS
OUT
UNLESS
BY
RULE
THE
BALL
IS
DEAD
AND
THE
BATTER
IS
SAFE
THEN
I
GUESS
THE

ADVANCE
UNMOLESTED

CANT
REALLY
TELL
