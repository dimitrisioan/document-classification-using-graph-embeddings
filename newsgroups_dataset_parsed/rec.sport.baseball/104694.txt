DERBY
THATS
VERY
TRUE
I
LIVE
IN
RICHMOND
HOME
OF
THE
AAA
RICHMOND
BRAVES
AND
THEY
HAVE
THIS
GUY
RYAN
KLESKO
WHO
HIT
HRS
AT

LAST

NOW
THAT
DOESNT
SOUND
LIKE
A
WHOLE
LOT
BUT
THE
WAY
THE
DIAMOND

BUILT
HOME
RUNS
ARE
A
RARITY
IN
FACT
RON
GANT
BRIAN
HUNTER
AND
DAVID
JUSTICE
ALL
PROVED
THEY
COULD
HIT
IN
RICHMOND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
SENT
TO
THE

THEY
NEVER
CAME
BACK
IF
YOU
CAN
HIT
IN
RICHMOND
YOU
CAN
HIT
ANYWHERE
SO

AFTER
BEATING
SCRANTON
