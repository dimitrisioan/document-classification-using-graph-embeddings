anyone
know
the
status
of
jeffries
or
arocha
arocha
broke
his
finger
trying
to
field
a
ground
ball
he
was
put
on
the
dl
after
the
game
and
may
require
surgery
the
injury
is
to
his
fielding
hand
which
is
good
unfortunately
he
may
have
some
ligament
damage
and
may
require
surgery
which
would
lay
him
up
for
a
while
i
dont
know
about
jefferies
apparently
just
a
strain
of
some
sort
he
hasnt
been
put
on
the
dl
so
its
probably
just
daytoday
