RE
JACK
MORRIS
IN
DEMERSCSUCSDEDU
DAVID
DEMERS
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
THE
FACTS
ARE
THAT
MORRIS
HAS
SHOWN
US
THAT
HE
HAS
WHAT
IT
TAKES
TO
PLAY
ON
A
WS
WINNING
CLUB
CLEMENS
HASNT
WHAT
DOES
IT
TAKE
TO
PLAY
ON
A
WS
WINNING
CLUB
WE
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
BECAUSE
WE
CANNOT
SEPARATE
MORRIS
CONTRIBU
TION
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
TEAMS
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
WAY
OF
DETERMIN
ING
BEST
IN
BASEBALL
AND
THAT
IS
BY
LOOKING
AT
THE
SCOREBOARD
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
GAME
EACH
GAME
DETERMINES
WHICH
TEAM
IS
THE
BEST
THAT
DAY
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
THE
TEAM
THAT
WAS
THE
BEST
THE
MOST
OFTEN
IS
THE
BEST
IN
THE
DIVISION
THE
PLAYOFFS
DETERMINE
THE
BEST
OF
THE
BEST
BUT
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THE
ONLY
DECISION
MAKING
PRO
CESS
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
BEST
IS
THE
SCORE
OF
THE
GAME
AND
IT
RE
LATES
TO
THE
TEAMS
NOT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PLAYERS
THERE
IS
NO
METHOD
INHERENT
IN
BASEBALL
OF
COMPARING
INDIVIDUAL
PERFORMANCES
AND
THAT
IS
HOW
IT
SHOULD
BE
BECAUSE
AFTER
ALL
BASEBALL
IS
A
TEAM
GAME
TO
SAY
THAT
ONE
PLAYER
IS
BETTER
THAN
ANOTHER
IS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SAY
AB
SOLUTELY
THAT
PLAYER
AS
TEAM
WOULD
HAVE
PLAYED
BETTER
WITH
PLAYER
B
IN
THEIR
LINEUP
SHEER
SPECULATION
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ASCERTAIN
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
SELECT
A
GROUP
OF
STATISTICS
AND
CLAIM
THAT
CLEMENS
HAS
DONE
BETTER
WITH
THOSE
STATISTICS
AS
A
CRITERIA
THEN
FINE
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
PROVE
THAT
THOSE
STATISTICS
MEASURE
THE
INDIVIDUALS
CONTRIBUTION
TO
WINNING
THE
WS
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
ONLY
MEASURE
OF
BEST
THAT
HAS
ANY
MEANING
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
BASE
BALL
SO
UNTIL
YOU
CAN
PROVE
THAT
CLEMENS
CONTRIBUTES
TO
A
WS
CHAM
PIONSHIP
MORE
THAN
MORRIS
YOUR
EVALUATION
OF
CLEMENS
IS
TOTALLY
SUB
JECTIVE
AND
IS
MERE
OPINION
I
HAVE
YET
TO
SEE
THAT
ANY
OF
YOU
CAN
PREDICT
A
WS
WINNER
WITH
ANY
GREATER
ACCURACY
THAN
JEANNE
DIXON
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
MORRIS
DIDNT
WIN
ANY
BALLGAMES
TORONTO
DID
IN
SPITE
OF
MORRIS
CONTRIBUTION
THIS
HAS
BEEN
EXPLAINED
TO
YOU
EXACTLY
THE
JAYS
WON
WITH
MORRIS
PITCHING
AND
BOSTON
WINS
WITH
CLEMENS
PITCHING
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
MORRIS
IS
BETTER
THAN
CLEMENS
I
AM
SAYING
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
COMPARISONS
BETWEEN
PLAYERS
ARE
TOTALLY
MEANINGLESS
AND
THAT
ANYONE
CLAIMING
THAT
CLEMENS
IS
BETTER
BASED
ON
HIS
ERA
HAS
MISSED
THE
POINT
OF
WHAT
BASEBALL
IS
ALL
ABOUT
MANY
MANY
TIMES
AND
YOU
ARE
EITHER
TOO
STUPID
OR
TOO
STUBBORN
TO
GRASP
IT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
BE
RUDE
YOU
ARE
COMPLETELY
CONSUMED
BY
THE
POST
HOC
ERGO
PROPTER
HOC
FALLACY
FOR
YOU
TO
SAY
THAT
MEANS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
EITHER
MISSED
THE
ENTIRE
POINT
OF
MY
ARGUMENT
OR
YOU
YOURSELF
HAVE
COMMITTED
A
FALLACY
IGNORATIO
ELENCHI
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
MORRIS
IS
BETTER
THAN
CLEMENS
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
MORE
RINGS
ALTHOUGH
I
HAVE
TONGUE
IN
CHEEK
CLAIMED
THAT
IN
THE
PAST
I
AM
SAYING
THAT
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ISOLATE
AN
INDIVIDUALS
PERFORMANCE
FROM
THAT
OF
HIS
TEAMS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
COMPARING
THAT
INDIVIDUALS
PERFORMANCE
WITH
ANOTHER
INDIVIDUALS
PER
FORMANCE
THE
STATS
ARE
A
NICE
HOBBY
AND
THATS
ABOUT
IT
THERE
IS
NO
NEW
KNOWLEDGE
BEING
PRODUCED
SO
WHEN
A
POSTER
CLAIMS
THAT
MORRIS
IS
BETTER
THAN
CLEMENS
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
MORE
RINGS
THE
POSTER
IS
NO
MORE
NOR
LESS
INCORRECT
THAN
THE
REST
OF
YOU
BAYING
HOUNDS
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
SO
MANY
MORONS
RM
AND
SO
LITTLE
TIME
