having
bonds
batting
behind
williams
means
that
matt
will
get
more
good
pitches
to
hit
this
is
important
since
he
struggles
so
much
with
breaking
balls
opposing
pitchers
dont
want
to
walk
williams
to
get
to
bonds
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
good
hitter
behind
you
argument
is
really
valid
has
anyone
done
a
study
on
this
you
want
a
study
look
at
matt
williams
the
year
after
mitchell
was
gone
look
no
further
not
a
scientific
study
but
itll
show
the
truth
for
matt
besides
bonds
wants
to
bat
i
had
thought
that
williams
batted
after
mitchell
wouldnt
that
show
that
williams
does
better
at
rather
than
the
point
is
moot
though
becase
clark
pretty
much
demands
to
be
and
like
you
point
out
bonds
does
like
to
bat
the
only
person
left
to
bat
is
williams
