HAVING
BONDS
BATTING
BEHIND
WILLIAMS
MEANS
THAT
MATT
WILL
GET
MORE
GOOD
PITCHES
TO
HIT
THIS
IS
IMPORTANT
SINCE
HE
STRUGGLES
SO
MUCH
WITH
BREAKING
BALLS
OPPOSING
PITCHERS
DONT
WANT
TO
WALK
WILLIAMS
TO
GET
TO

I
HAVE
TO
WONDER

THIS
GOOD
HITTER
BEHIND
YOU
ARGUMENT
IS
REALLY
VALID

A
STUDY
ON

YOU
WANT
A
STUDY

THE
TRUTH
FOR
MATT
BESIDES
BONDS
WANTS
TO
BAT
I
HAD
THOUGHT
THAT

AFTER
MITCHELL
WOULDNT
THAT
SHOW
THAT
WILLIAMS
DOES
BETTER
AT
RATHER
THAN
THE
POINT
IS
MOOT
THOUGH
BECASE
CLARK
PRETTY
MUCH
DEMANDS
TO
BE
AND
LIKE
YOU
POINT
OUT
BONDS
DOES
LIKE

BAT
THE
ONLY
PERSON
LEFT

BAT
IS
WILLIAMS
