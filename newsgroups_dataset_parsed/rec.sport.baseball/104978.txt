ARTICLE
STEVETESKIMOCOM
STEVEN
THORNTON
WRITES
STUFF
DELETED
MATTINGLY
SCORES
BADLY
ON
BOTH
COUNTS
HE
DOESNT
GET
TO
VERY
MANY
BALLS
AND
HE
LETS
A
LOT
OF
BALLS
GO
THROUGH
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
LOOKS
SMOOTH
HAS
GREAT
HANDS
AND
MAKES
FEW
ERRORS
MEANS
NOTHING
THIS
IS
TRADITIONAL
BRAINLESS
RELIANCE
ON
OBSERVATIONS
THAT
CAN
EASILY
BE
MISLED
LIKE
A
LOT
OF
BAD
FIELDERS
MATTINGLY
ACTUALLY
MAKES
HIMSELF
LOOK
BETTER
BY
NOT
HAVING
ANY
RANGE
HES
NOWHERE
NEAR
AS
BAD
AS
STEVE
GARVEY
BUT
THATS
NOT
MUCH
OF
A
COMPLIMENT
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
FLAVOR
OF
THIS
POST
BUT
DISAGREE
WITH
ONE
SPECIFIC
ARGUMENT
THAT
HAS
GREAT
HANDS
MEANS
NOTHING
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
A
FIRSTBASEMANS
DEFENSIVE
VALUE
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
OR
EVEN
PRIMARILY
FROM
HIS
ABILITY
TO
FIELD
GROUNDERS
OR
CATCH
POPUPS
HOW
MANY
SUCH
CHANCES
DOES
HE
GET
DURING
A
GAME
MANY
FEWER
THAN
HE
GETS
CHANCES
TO
CATCH
THROWS
FROM
AND
P
I
MEAN
THE
TOTAL
OF
THESE
IS
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
GROUNDERPOPUP
TOTALS
THIS
IMPLIES
TO
ME
THAT
THERE
IS
VALUE
IN
CATCHING
THESE
THROWS
WELL
EVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
HIGH
UPTHELINE
OR
IN
THE
DIRT
GOOD
HANDS
ARE
NEEDED
FOR
SUCH
PLAYS
AND
THUS
HAVE
VALUE
I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
NUMBERS
FOR
THE
RELATIVE
NUMBER
OF
OCCURENCES
OF
THESE
PLAYS
BUT
ID
GUESS
THAT
THE
VALUES
OF
THESE
ABILITIES
ARE
SIMILAR
ITS
JUST
LIKE
YOU
DONT
JUDGE
CATCHERS
DEFENSE
PRIMARILY
ON
HOW
THEY
FIELD
BUNTS
AND
POPUPS
BUT
NOT
AS
MARKED
I
SUPPOSE
MICHAEL
