WHY
IS
BARRY
BONDS
NOT
BATTING
AS
THE
HEADING
INDICATES
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
ME
TO
FATHOM
WHY
BARRY
IS
NOT
BATTING
FOR
THE
GIANTS
BEHIND
WILL
CLARK
BARRY
IS
SUCH
AN
AWESOME
AND
CONSISTENT
HITTER
DEFINITELY
THE
BEST
IN
THE
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
IMHO
TO
HAVE
WILLIAMS
A
STREAKY
HITTER
AND
NOT
REALLY
A
CLUTCH
HITTER
BATTING
AHEAD
OF
BONDS
IS
SIMPLY
AN
INJUSTICE
TO
THE
GIANTS
AND
FANS
OF
THE
GIANTS
