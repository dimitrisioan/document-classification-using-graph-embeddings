IN
ANY
CASE
I
THINK
VIOLA
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
A
BETTER
SIGNING
WHY
VIOLA
IS
YOUNGER
AND
IS
LEFT
HANDED
HOW
MANY
LEFT
HANDED
STARTERS
DOES
TORONTO
HAVE
WELL
I
AGREE
THAT
VIOLA
IS
A
BETTER
SIGNING
HOWEVER
WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
SAY
THAT
YOU
WANT
LEFTHANDED
STARTERS
I
UNDERSTAND
LEFTHANDED
SPOT
RELIEVERS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
USUALLY
FACE
MORE
RIGHTHANDED
BATTERS
THAN
LEFTHANDED
BATTERS
I
JUST
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
PEOPLE
INSIST
ON
LEFTHANDED
STARTERS
UNLESS
THERE
IS
A
PARK
EFFECT
EG
YANKEE
STADIUM
THE
ANSWER
IS
THEYRE
STUPID
SERIOUSLY
I
THINK
YOURE
RIGHT
ON
THE
MONEY
IVE
NEVER
UNDERSTOOD
THE
PREOCCUPATION
WITH
MAKING
SURE
A
ROTATION
HAS
LEFTHANDED
STARTERS
THE
ONLY
TIME
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
ME
IS
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
AN
UNBALANCED
SCHEDULE
AND
YOUR
MAIN
RIVALS
IS
LOADED
WITH
LEFTHANDED
HITTERS
OTHER
THAN
THAT
I
THINK
YOURE
COMPLETELY
RIGHT
