RE
JAYS
DARRIN
JACKSON
IS
A
NIGHTMARE
GIVE
JACKSON
A
BREAKHE
LOST
ABOUT
POUNDS
WITH
THAT
FLU
HE
HAD
WHEN
HE
WAS
TRADED
DJ
WAS
A
POPULAR
PLAYER
IN
SAN
DIEGO
DEREK
BELL
WAS
NOT
FARING
WELL
IN
THE
CLUBHOUSE
AT
TORONTO
SO
NO
MATTER
HOW
BAD
HE
LOOKS
NOW
I
STILL
THINK
IT
WAS
A
STEAL
FOR
THE
JAYS
JUST
FROM
THE
PERSPECTIVE
OF
TEAM
CHEMISTRY
NO
STATISTIC
CAN
DESCRIBE
IT
SORRY
STATHEADS
AND
SINCE
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
NEW
FACES
IN
THE
CLUBHOUSE
I
THINK
THE
JAYS
ARE
STILL
TRYING
TO
FIND
IT
INSERT
THE
SAME
COMMENT
INTO
THE
JACK
MORRIS
V
CLEMENS
WS
RING
STRING
YET
AT
FIRST
I
WAS
SAD
TO
SEE
DEREK
GO
STILL
ANTICIPATING
ALL
OF
THE
TALENT
THEY
RAVED
ABOUT
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
LAST
SEASON
IM
GLAD
TO
SEE
HIM
FARING
WELL
FOR
THE
PADRES
THOUGH
