WADE
BOGGS
I
LIVE
IN
BOSTON
AND
LIKE
WADE
A
LOT
BUT
HIS
CAREER
IS
WINDING
DOWN
AND
I
WOULD
RATHER
SEE
THE
YANKS
START
TO
DEVELOP
A
LONG
TERM
SOLUTION
IE
HENSLEY
MUELINS
RUSS
DAVIS
VELARDE
BESIDES
WADE
JUST
DOESNT
HAVE
ANY
RANGE
WHAT
A
SHAME
ABOUT
CHARLIE
HAYES
HUH
WHO
WOULD
YOU
HAVE
PLAYING
WADE
BOGGS
OR
CHARLIE
HAYES
MY
CHOICE
IS
BOGGS
NO
CONTEST
IT
WILL
GIVE
THEM
TIME
TO
DEVELOP
YOUNGER
TALENT
IN
AN
AREA
THE
YANKEE
FARM
SYSTEM
SEEMS
TO
BE
DEFICIENT
AHEM
TWO
WORDS
RUSSELL
DAVIS
PLAYING
IN
THE
CAVERN
AT
ALBANY
AA
LAST
YEAR
DOWN
THE
ALLEYS
AND
TO
CENTER
DAVIS
WENT
WITH
HOMERS
THERE
ARENT
ANY
SMALL
PARKS
ON
THE
ROAD
IN
THE
EASTERN
LEAGUE
EITHER
HES
AND
HIS
MLE
WAS
HR
I
HAVE
NO
FIELDING
STATISTICS
BUT
FROM
SEEING
HIM
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
LAST
YEAR
ID
SAY
THAT
HES
NOT
BROOKS
ROBINSON
BUT
NEITHER
IS
HE
HOWARD
JOHNSON
UNLESS
THEY
THINK
THEY
CAN
WIN
THE
PENNANT
THIS
YEAR
WHICH
SEEMS
POSSIBLE
AND
NEED
BOGGS
TO
DO
IT
I
THINK
THEYRE
MAKING
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
MISTAKE
WITH
DAVIS
THAT
BOSTON
MADE
WITH
BOGGS
LEAVING
HIM
IN
THE
MINORS
FOR
TWO
OR
THREE
YEARS
AFTER
HED
SHOWN
THAT
HE
WAS
A
GOOD
HITTER
SPIKE
OWEN
SEE
WADE
BOGGS
ID
MUCH
RATHER
SEE
THEM
DEVELOP
DAVE
SILVESTRI
OR
WHOEVER
WADE
AND
SPIKE
NEXT
TO
EACH
OTHER
IN
THE
INFIELD
IS
GOING
TO
RAISE
THE
YANKEE
STAFF
ERA
POINT
AND
THESE
GUYS
ARE
ON
THE
DOWN
SIDES
OF
THEIR
CAREERS
TOO
BAD
THEY
GAVE
UP
ON
RANDY
VALARDE
TOO
MANY
TRIPS
ON
THE
COLUMBUS
SHUTTLE
HRM
THEY
STILL
HAVE
HIM
ON
THE
ROSTER
AB
THROUGH
THE
FIRST
TWO
WEEKS
THEYVE
JUST
NEVER
FIGURED
OUT
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
HIM
I
SUSPECT
THAT
HE
HITS
ENOUGH
ESPECIALLY
VS
LEFTIES
TO
BE
A
REASONABLE
SHORTSTOP
ONE
RUMOR
RUNNING
AROUND
DURING
SPRING
TRAINING
WAS
THAT
THEY
WANTED
TO
CONVERT
SILVESTRI
TO
BE
A
CATCHER
BECAUSE
HIS
BODY
TYPE
WAS
WRONG
FOR
A
SHORTSTOP
YOUD
THINK
THAT
SOMEBODY
IN
THE
SAME
DIVISION
WHO
PLAYS
BALTIMORE
ABOUT
A
DOZEN
TIMES
A
YEAR
WOULD
KNOW
BETTER
MIKE
JONES
AIX
HIGHEND
DEVELOPMENT
MJONESDONALDAIXKINGSTONIBMCOM
IF
ONE
OF
OUR
GUYS
WENT
DOWN
I
JUST
DOUBLED
IT
NO
CONFUSION
THERE
IT
DIDNT
REQUIRE
A
RHODES
SCHOLAR
IF
TWO
OF
MY
TEAMMATES
WENT
DOWN
FOUR
OF
YOURS
WOULD
I
HAD
TO
PROTECT
MY
GUYS
DON
DRYSDALE
IN
REGARD
TO
BOGGS
ILL
RELATE
A
STORY
ABOUT
A
YANKEE
FAN
AT
FENWAY
LAST
YEAR
FOR
OPENING
DAY
I
WAS
THERE
TO
SEE
THEM
FACE
BALTIMORE
AND
COULDNT
HELP
BUT
LISTEN
TO
THE
BOSTON
FANS
TALK
ABOUT
VARIOUS
PLAYERS
ON
THE
TEAM
ONE
GUY
WAS
TOTALLY
OBLITERATING
BOGGS
HOW
HE
SUCKS
ETC
I
TOLD
HIM
I
WAS
A
YANKEE
FAN
AND
ID
TAKE
HIM
IN
A
SECOND
AND
WHO
WOULD
HE
WANT
IN
A
TRADE
BACK
HE
SAID
A
PILE
OF
SHT
I
KNOW
BOGGS
HAD
SOME
PERSONAL
PROBLEMS
WHILE
PLAYING
FOR
BOSTON
BUT
COME
ON
HES
A
FUTURE
HALL
OF
FAMER
WHO
REALLY
ADDS
A
NEEDED
DIMENSION
TO
THE
YANKS
A
SOLID
HITTER
A
DECENT
FIELDER
AND
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
A
TEACHER
ASK
PAT
KELLY
I
THINK
HES
GOT
A
FEW
GOOD
YEARS
LEFT
IN
HIS
BAT
AND
MAY
BE
A
KEY
CONTRIBUTOR
DOWN
THE
STRETCH
AS
THEY
WIN
THE
AMERICAN
LEAGUE
EAST
THIS
YEAR
BOSTON
FANS
HAVE
NO
CLASS
THEYLL
PROBABLY
BOO
HIM
LIKE
CRAZY
HIS
FIRST
TIME
BACK
IN
PINSTRIPES
AND
I
HOPE
HE
GOES
FOR
AND
SHUTS
THEM
UP
