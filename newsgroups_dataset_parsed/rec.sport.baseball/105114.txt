RE
YANKS
OVER
AS
GEORGE
SPEAKS
IN
KWOLFEREAGLEWESLEYANEDU
WRITES
HOW
ABOUT
MATT
NOKES
RUN
SINGLE
AGAINST
RON
DARLING
WAS
THAT
A
HIT
OR
WHAT
WHILE
WATCHING
THE
GAME
YESTERDAY
THEY
FLASHED
UP
SOMETHING
REGARDING
THE
BOSS
TALKING
ABOUT
MARK
CONNOR
AS
BULLPEN
COACH
HE
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
ITS
MARK
CONNORS
FAULT
THAT
THE
BULLPEN
IS
SO
HORRIBLE
HERE
WE
GO
AGAIN
GEORGE
STICKING
HIS
NONBASEBALL
NOSE
IN
THE
BASEBALL
BUSINESS
SHUT
UP
GEORGE
JUST
SPEND
THE
MONEY
GET
THE
PLAYERS
AND
LEAVE
BUCK
AND
THE
COACHES
AND
PLAYERS
ALONE
I
SAW
THAT
QUOTE
FLASHED
ON
THE
SCREEN
YESTERDAY
ALSO
AND
WHAT
ENRAGED
ME
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
WAS
NOT
THAT
GEORGE
WAS
SPEAKING
UP
AGAI
AND
COMPLAINING
TO
THE
MEDIA
INSTEAD
OF
TO
THE
PROPER
PEOPLE
IT
WAS
THAT
THE
IDIOT
REPORTER
PROVIDED
GEORGE
WITH
AN
OUTLET
AND
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
CREATE
TROUBLE
THIS
IS
A
SUPREME
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
THE
MEDIA
CAN
TRULY
CONTROL
SITUATIONS
THE
LOCAL
BEAT
REPORTERS
SHOULD
KNOW
BETTER
AND
SHOULD
STOP
TRYING
TO
ONEUP
EACH
OTHER
WITH
QUOTES
FROM
THE
BOSS
IF
THEY
JUST
IGNORED
HIM
HED
REALLY
SIMPLY
GO
AWAY
AND
PROBLEMS
WOULD
BE
AVOIDED
WHAT
THAT
REPORTER
DID
WAS
POTENTIALLY
