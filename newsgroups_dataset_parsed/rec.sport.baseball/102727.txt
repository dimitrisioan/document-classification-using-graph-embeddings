i
totally
agree
with
each
point
you
made
jose
viscaino
looked
like
a
single
a
hitter
up
there
who
swings
on
count
with
maddux
pitching
and
your
teams
down
by
a
run
and
you
havent
touched
the
ball
all
day
i
also
think
too
much
is
made
of
that
leftyrighty
thing
watching
the
cubs
games
i
get
the
feeling
steve
stone
knows
a
lot
more
about
what
the
cubs
should
be
doing
than
lefebre
does
harry
said
it
best
when
he
stated
after
another
terrible
vizcaino
at
bat
we
cant
wait
til
sandberg
returns
i
tell
you
steve
stone
is
like
a
prophet
he
must
be
making
a
ton
in
the
boradcoast
booth
because
i
cant
understand
why
hes
not
actually
back
in
the
game
itself
the
other
day
he
called
sosas
homerun
against
the
sox
and
claimed
the
game
would
be
going
into
extra
innings
when
the
score
was
in
the
so
yesterday
he
notices
that
sosas
ahead
in
the
count
against
maddux
and
says
this
is
a
fastball
situation
and
sosa
will
be
looking
for
it
but
this
is
also
the
spot
where
maddux
throws
the
straight
change
sure
enough
sosa
gets
ahead
on
it
and
pops
it
up
to
the
infield
stoney
for
cubs
manager
