HEYIVE
NOTICED
THAT
LUIS
ALICEA
IS
STARTING
AT
FOR
THE
CARDINALS
INSTEAD
OF
GERONIMO
PENA
IS
PENA
HURT
OR
WAS
HE
JUST
BENCHED
FOR
POOR
PERFORMANCE
ANYONE
KNOW
AFTER
A
QUICK
START
PENA
HAS
BEEN
STUCK
IN
A
RUT
TORRE
GAVE
ALICEA
THE
START
TO
TRY
TO
GET
PENA
OUT
OF
WHATEVER
FUNK
HE
IS
IN
IT
HAS
WORKED
IN
THE
PAST
AND
IT
HAS
WORKED
AGAIN
PENA
WENT
FOR
LAST
NIGHT
AGAINST
COLORADO
WITHOUT
OPENING
THIS
UP
FOR
A
SABERMETRIC
FLAME
WAR
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
QUESTION
THE
NOTION
THAT
SITTING
A
RESTED
PLAYER
DOWN
HAS
ANY
REAL
EFFECT
ON
HIS
LONGTERM
PERFORMANCE
SURE
IF
A
MAN
IS
TIRED
AND
NEEDS
REAL
REST
THEN
TAKING
A
BREAK
MIGHT
BE
A
CONSTRUCTIVE
ACT
PERHAPS
IF
A
MAN
IS
MENTALLY
STRAINED
THEN
SITTING
HIM
DOWN
MIGHT
HELP
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
THAT
HELPS
HIM
RELAX
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
PLAYERS
DO
SLUMP
AND
BENCHING
IS
PROBABLY
IRRELEVANT
