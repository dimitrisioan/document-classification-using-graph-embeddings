rockies
need
some
relief
once
again
the
rockies
bullpen
fell
apart
andy
ashby
pitched
six
somewhat
shaky
innings
giving
up
just
one
run
then
game
the
dreaded
relief
three
picthers
combined
to
give
up
runs
one
each
i
believe
in
the
inning
and
blew
the
save
opportunity
final
was
vs
expos
despite
their
problems
in
the
pen
i
think
the
rockies
are
a
team
that
wont
be
taken
lightly
going
into
todays
game
the
had
the
leagues
leading
hitter
and
rbi
man
galarraga
two
of
the
leaders
in
stolen
bases
young
and
cole
and
increasingly
strong
starting
pitching
