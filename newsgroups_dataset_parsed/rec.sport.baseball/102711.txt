DAVID
M
TATE
WRITES
MSSNETCOMCOM
MARK
SINGER
SAID
WE
KNOW
THAT
VERY
VERY
FEW
PLAYERS
AT
THIS
AGE
MAKE
MUCH
OF
AN
IMPACT
IN
THE
BIGS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THEY
HAVENT
EVEN
PLAYED
AAA
BALL
YES
BUT
THIS
IS
IRRELEVANT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
AVERAGES
WHEN
WE
HAVE
LOTS
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THIS
PLAYER
IN
PARTICULAR
TO
BASE
OUR
DECISIONS
ON
DO
YOU
REALLY
HAVE
THAT
MUCH
INFORMATION
ON
HIM
REALLY
I
DONT
PERSONALLY
BUT
CLAY
JUST
POSTED
IT
YES
WE
DO
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
SHOWS
THAT
LOPEZ
WASNT
AS
GOOD
AN
EXAMPLE
AS
NIEVES
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SINCE
HIS
LAST
YEAR
NUMBERS
WERE
OUT
OF
LINE
WITH
THE
PREVIOUS
YEARS
WHICH
I
DIDNT
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
POINT
REMAINS
THOUGH
KNOWING
A
GUYS
MINOR
LEAGUE
HISTORY
IS
AS
GOOD
AS
KNOWING
HIS
MAJOR
LEAGUE
HISTORY
IF
YOU
KNOW
HOW
TO
READ
IT
WHY
ISNT
LOPEZ
LIKELY
TO
HIT
THAT
WELL
HE
HIT
THAT
WELL
LAST
YEAR
AFTER
ADJUSTING
HIS
STATS
FOR
PARK
AND
LEAGUE
AND
SUCH
HE
HIT
BETTER
ON
AN
ABSOLUTE
SCALE
THAN
OLSON
OR
BERRYHILL
DID
BY
A
LOT
I
DONT
KNOW
YOU
TELL
ME
WHAT
PERCENTAGE
OF
PLAYERS
REACH
OR
EXCEED
THEIR
MLES
IN
THEIR
ROOKIE
SEASON
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
YOU
KNOW
THE
MLE
IS
NOT
A
PROJECTION
ITS
AN
EQUIVALENCE
ITS
A
THIS
IS
HOW
WELL
HE
HIT
LAST
YEAR
IN
MAJOR
LEAGUE
TERMS
RATING
SO
IN
ESSENCE
HE
HAS
ALREADY
REACHED
IT
I
WOULD
GUESS
BOB
CLAY
THAT
ESSENTIALLY
HALF
OF
ALL
PLAYERS
SURPASS
THEIR
PREVIOUS
MLES
IN
THEIR
ROOKIE
SEASONS
MAYBE
MORE
THAN
HALF
SINCE
ALL
OF
THESE
PLAYERS
ARE
YOUNG
AND
IMPROVING
IF
THAT
WERE
YOUR
PURPOSE
MAYBE
OFFERMAN
SPENT
GETTING
ACCLIMATED
IF
YOU
WILL
THE
DODGERS
AS
A
TEAM
PAID
A
BIG
PRICE
THAT
SEASON
DID
THEY
OFFERMAN
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
OR
PLACE
AND
LAST
PLACE
BUT
NO
MORE
PERHAPS
THEY
WILL
REAP
THE
BENEFITS
DOWN
THE
ROAD
DO
YOU
REALLY
THINK
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
WHAT
THEY
DID
IF
THEY
WERE
COMPETING
FOR
A
PENNANT
SURE
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
ANYONE
BETTER
I
SUPPOSE
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
GUTTED
THE
FARM
SYSTEM
TO
ACQUIRE
JAY
BELL
OR
SPIKE
OWEN
OR
SOMEBODY
IF
THEY
WERE
REALLY
IN
CONTENTION
THE
POINT
WAS
NOT
THAT
AB
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
SAMPLE
BUT
RATHER
THAT
HE
HADNT
DONE
ANYTHING
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
TO
CAUSE
EVEN
A
BLOCKHEAD
MANAGER
TO
QUESTION
WHETHER
HIS
MINOR
LEAGUE
NUMBERS
WERE
FOR
REAL
OR
TO
SEND
HIM
DOWN
UNTIL
HE
GETS
WARMED
UP
FOR
A
STATHEAD
IM
AMAZED
THAT
YOU
PUT
ANY
CREDENCE
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
IF
YOUD
READ
WHAT
I
WROTE
YOUD
BE
LESS
AMAZED
NOWHERE
DO
I
CLAIM
TO
PUT
ANY
CREDENCE
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
QUITE
THE
CONTRARY
I
SAID
THAT
LOPEZ
HADNT
DONE
ANYTHING
THAT
EVEN
THE
BOZOS
WHO
DO
PUT
CREDENCE
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
COULD
INTERPRET
AS
FAILURE
JUST
BECAUSE
I
THINK
SPRING
TRAINING
NUMBERS
ARE
MEANINGLESS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
BOBBY
COX
DOES
ITS
JUST
A
CASE
OF
RULING
OUT
ONE
POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION
FOR
SENDING
LOPEZ
DOWN
THE
KID
WILL
IMPROVE
PLAYING
AT
AAA
JUST
LIKE
KEITH
MITCHELL
DID
WAIT
A
MINUTE
I
MISSED
SOMETHING
HERE
KEITH
MITCHELL
DID
VERY
VERY
WELL
AT
AA
AAA
AND
THE
MAJORS
OVER
A
SEASON
THEN
DID
VERY
VERY
POORLY
FOR
A
YEAR
IN
AAA
DAVID
M
TATE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
IS
ABOUT
YOU
THAT
CLOSES
POSING
AS
AND
OPENS
ONLY
SOMETHING
IN
ME
UNDERSTANDS
E
E
CAN
THE
POCKET
OF
YOUR
GLOVE
IS
DEEPER
THAN
PETE
ROSES
DY
CUMMINGS
NOBODY
NOT
EVEN
TIM
RAINES
HAS
SUCH
SOFT
HANDS
