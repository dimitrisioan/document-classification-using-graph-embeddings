MARK
SINGER
WRITES
THAT
EXUBERANCE
DISAPPEARED
IMMEDIATELY
HOWEVER
WHEN
STRAWBERRY
WENT
INTO
A
TIRADE
AT
THE
MAN
ALL
REPORTS
INDICATE
HE
USED
A
LOT
OF
PROFANITY
AND
ACCUSED
THE
MAN
OF
INTERFERENCE
AND
THEREFORE
OF
COSTING
THE
DODGERS
A
GAME
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS
OTHER
FANS
HURLED
FOOD
AND
BEVERAGES
TOWARD
THE
MAN
WHO
MADE
THE
CATCH
DODGER
STADIUM
OFFICIALS
STARTED
TO
REMOVE
HIM
FROM
THE
PARK
BUT
THEN
RELENTED
AND
JUST
RELOCATED
HIM
TO
ANOTHER
AREA
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
AFTER
THE
GAME
LASORDA
BLAMED
THE
FAN
FOR
THE
LOSS
STRAWBERRY
ALSO
WENT
INTO
A
TIRADE
ABOUT
HOW
THE
FANS
ARE
STUPID
AND
THEY
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
WINNING
LA
TIMES
COLUMNISTS
SIMILARLY
BLASTED
THE
MAN
WHO
MADE
THE
CATCH
SOUNDS
LIKE
DARRYL
BEING
DARRYL
TOMMY
SPENDING
TOO
MUCH
TIME
ON
SLIM
FAST
AND
NEEDS
A
PASTA
FIX
AND
THE
MEDIA
BEING
THEIR
USUAL
CHARMING
SELVES
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
NEW
YORKLIKE
STORY
TO
ME
I
SAW
THE
REPLAY
AND
AM
WONDERING
WHAT
THE
BIG
DEAL
IS
I
DIDNT
REALIZE
THE
FOLKS
IN
LA
WERE
MAKING
A
BIG
TO
DO
ABOUT
IT
I
THINK
STAWBERRY
LASORDA
AND
THE
VARIOUS
MEDIA
TYPES
SHOULD
SIT
AND
WATCH
THE
REPLAY
THEN
APOLOGIZE
TO
THE
FAN
OTHERS
HAVE
QUESTIONED
WHY
DARRYL
SHOULD
BE
SO
CONCERNED
WITH
WHAT
THE
FAN
DID
WHEN
HE
HAS
A
GRAND
TOTAL
OF
RBI
THROUGH
THE
FIRST
NINE
GAMES
DARRYL
HAS
NOT
GOTTEN
OFF
TO
A
GOOD
START
HE
HAS
TO
BLAME
SOMEONE
BUT
I
GUESS
THE
BIG
DEBATE
CONTINUES
AS
TO
WHAT
ARE
THE
RESPONSIBILITIES
OF
THE
FAN
AS
LONG
AS
THE
FAN
DOESNT
INTERFERE
WITH
THE
PLAY
I
SEE
NO
PROBLEMS
