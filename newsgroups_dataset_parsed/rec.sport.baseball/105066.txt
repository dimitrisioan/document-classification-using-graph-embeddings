SAM
MANDELBAUM
SAYS
YES
EVERYONE
SEEMS
TO
BE
IN
AGREEMENT
THAT
THE
YANKEES
ARE
FINALLY
MOVING
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
THEY
SHOULD
FINISH
OVER
THIS
YEAR
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
BE
IN
THE
PENNENT
RACE
IN
AUGUST
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
TAKE
BACK
A
FEW
MOVES
THE
JIM
ABBOTT
TRADE
BLEAGH
THIS
WAS
A
TERRIFIC
TRADE
SNOW
WILL
CERTAINLY
BE
BETTER
THAN
MATTINGLY
IN
THE
FUTURE
BUT
THAT
THEYLL
BE
ABOUT
THE
SAME
NOW
IS
A
DEFENSIBLE
OPINION
ABBOTT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
TRULY
GREAT
PITCHERS
IN
THE
GAME
TODAY
WADE
BOGGS
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
ONE
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
GOOD
IN
THAT
A
BOGGS
KICKS
HAYESMEULENSWHOEVERS
ASS
AND
THAT
A
BOGGS
STILL
ISNT
ALL
THAT
SHABBY
ITS
BAD
THOUGH
THAT
THE
YANKEES
EXPECT
A
BOGGS
AND
WILL
PROBABLY
GET
A
BOGGS
HOWEVER
ID
STILL
PLAY
BOGGS
OVER
HAYES
OR
BAM
BAM
SPIKE
OWEN
YOU
HAVE
MY
FULL
AGREEMENT
HERE
HES
NOT
ALL
THAT
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
VELARDE
AND
SILVESTRI
IS
JUST
ABOUT
A
LOCK
TO
BE
BETTER
THAN
HIM
HOWEVER
I
DO
ENJOY
THE
FACT
THAT
SPIKE
IS
NOT
A
NICKNAME
NOT
THAT
THIS
HELPS
THE
YANKEES
DANNY
TARTABULL
I
STRONGLY
DISAGREE
ID
MUCH
MUCH
RATHER
HAVE
A
HUNDRED
GAMES
OF
TARTABULL
AND
SIXTY
GAMES
OF
DION
JAMES
THAN
GAMES
OF
JAMES
BOB
VESTERMAN
