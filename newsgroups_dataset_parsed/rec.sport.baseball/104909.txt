DIDNT
BOB
HORNER
GO
STRAIGHT
FROM
ARIZONA
STATE
UNIV
TO
THE
ATLANTA
BRAVES
I
REMEMBER
HE
HAD
ONE
GREAT
MONTH
HITTING
DINGERS
AND
THEN
THE
NEXT
I
HEARD
HE
WAS
IN
JAPAN
A
MONTH
WELL
HE
DID
HAVE
A
SHORT
CAREERCOMPARED
TO
WHAT
ONE
MIGHT
HAVE
EXPECTED
FOR
SUCH
A
HIGHLY
TOUTED
PROSPECTDUE
TO
BEING
INJURY
PRONE
OVERWEIGHT
AND
HAVING
NO
WORK
ETHIC
BUT
HE
CERTAINLY
DID
NOT
SUFFER
FROM
BEING
RUSHED
TO
THE
BIGS
SORRY
LEN
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
HOW
HE
SUFFERED
FROM
BEING
RUSHED

HAVING
NO

ETHIC
LEADING
TO
BEING

PRONE
WITH
NOTHING

HAVE
BEEN
CORRECTED

DID
YOU
INTEND
A
SMILEY
AFTER
YOUR

I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
WHICH
IS
ALWAYS
IN
DOUBT
HORNERS
SIGNING
WITH
THE
BRAVES
WAS
CONTINGENT
ON
STARTING
IN
ATLANTA
I
THINK
HE
COULD
HAVE
GONE
BACK
TO
ARIZONA
ST
FOR
ONE
MORE
YEAR
IF
HE
HADNT
SIGNED
ANYHOW
THE
BRAVES
DID
TRY
TO
SEND
HIM
TO
RICHMOND
ONCE
IT
LEAD
TO
A
WEEKLONG
WALKOUT
METHINKS
HORNER
HAD
NO
WORK
ETHIC
BEFORE
HE
WAS
DRAFTED
AND
MINOR
LEAGUE
PLAY
WOULDNT
HAVE
HELPED
BUT
HIS
RAW
TALENT
WOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
HIM
INTO
THE
ML
AND
IT
DID
KEEP
HIM
THERE
FOR
A
WHILE
UNTIL
HE
STARTED
FALLING
ON
HIS
WRISTS
ERIC
TOO
LAZY
TO
UPDATE
HIS
SIG
ROUSH
