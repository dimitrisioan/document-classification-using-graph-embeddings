RE
JACK
MORRIS
IN
DAVID
ROBERT
WALKER
WRITES
WE
CANNOT
ISOLATE
COMPLETELY
ROGER
BUT
WE
CAN
MAKE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
ESTIMATE
I
WONT
CLAIM
TO
SPLIT
HAIRS
AND
SAY
THAT
WE
CAN
REALLY
MEASURE
WHO
WAS
BETTER
ROBBY
ALOMAR
OR
CARLOS
BAERGA
LAST
YEAR
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
TOO
CLOSE
TO
CALL
BUT
LARKIN
AND
LEE
CLEMENS
AND
MORRIS
THE
DIFFERENCES
ARE
TOO
GREAT
THERE
IN
YOUR
MEASURE
OF
THE
GAME
WHY
SHOULD
A
TEAM
THAT
HAS
JUST
WON
IT
ALL
EVER
REPLACE
A
SINGLE
PLAYER
SINCE
THEY
ARE
NOW
CLEARLY
BEST
HOW
CAN
THEY
DO
BETTER
YET
EVERY
TEAM
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
SOMEPLACE
WHERE
THEY
BELEIVE
THEY
CAN
IMPROVE
THE
TEAM
THEY
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
A
PLAYER
A
LITTLE
BETTER
THAN
ONE
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
BTW
BY
MY
DEFINITIONS
THE
BEST
PLAYER
IS
THE
ONE
WHO
DOES
THE
MOST
THINGS
TO
HELP
HIS
TEAM
WIN
I
WILL
ALLOW
THAT
THIS
COULD
VARY
DEPENDING
ON
WHO
ELSE
IS
ON
THE
TEAM
BY
HAVING
APTITUDES
ONE
TEAM
NEEDS
MORE
THAN
OTHERS
WELL
THEN
GIVEN
YOUR
DEFINITION
OF
BEST
IS
IT
NOT
CONCEIVABLE
THAT
ALFREDO
GRIFFIN
COULD
BRING
SOMETHING
TO
A
TEAM
THAT
THAT
TEAM
NEEDS
TO
WIN
WHILE
LARKIN
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
THAT
SOMETHING
THE
TEAM
NEEDS
WOULD
GRIFFIN
THEN
BE
BETTER
THAN
LARKIN
BASEBALL
IS
A
TEAM
GAME
BUT
IT
IS
MADE
OF
INDIVIDUAL
TALENTS
IT
IS
ABSURD
TO
JUDGE
THE
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
BY
THE
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
OF
HIS
TEAMMATES
WHOM
HE
DID
NOT
CHOOSE
AT
LEAST
IN
MOST
CASES
MORRIS
WON
LAST
YEAR
BECAUSE
HE
PLAYED
ON
A
TEAM
WITH
JOE
CARTER
ROBBY
ALOMAR
TOM
HENKE
JUAN
GUZMAN
JOHN
OLERUD
ET
AL
CLEMENS
LOST
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
SURROUNDED
BY
SUCH
LESSER
PERFORMERS
AS
HERM
WINNINHAM
LUIS
RIVERA
AND
JEFF
REARDON
TO
DEFINE
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
TEAM
AS
A
SUM
OF
ITS
COMPONENTS
AS
I
DO
ALBEIT
IMPERFECTLY
IS
A
LESSER
ERROR
THAN
DEFINING
THE
QUALITY
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
AS
THE
MEAN
QUALITY
OF
THE
TEAM
AS
MY
READING
OF
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
SUGGESTS
YOU
DO
NO
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
DEFINE
THE
QUALITY
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
AT
LEAST
NOT
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
RANKING
THEM
TORONTO
WON
WITH
OLERUD
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
WON
WITH
FIELDER
THEY
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
WON
WITH
THOMAS
DETROIT
MIGHT
HAVE
WON
WITH
THOMAS
CHICAGO
MIGHT
HAVE
WON
WITH
FIELDER
YOU
CANT
RANK
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
YOU
CAN
ONLY
LOOK
AT
WHO
MIGHT
CONTRIBUTE
MORE
TO
THE
TEAM
EFFORT
WHICH
IS
WINNING
THE
WS
THOMAS
COULD
NOT
HAVE
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THAT
GOAL
ANY
MORE
THAN
OLERUD
SO
I
CANNOT
SAY
THAT
OLERUD
IS
LESS
OF
A
PLAYER
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
SO
MANY
MORONS
RM
AND
SO
LITTLE
TIME
