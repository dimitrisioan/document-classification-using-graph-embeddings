re
jack
morris
my
father
is
a
huge
tiger
fan
and
i
am
a
loyal
blue
jay
fan
who
endured
the
collapse
of
the
heartbreak
of
i
dont
have
the
stat
book
so
lets
throw
them
out
first
of
all
morris
in
his
heyday
vs
clemens
how
many
cy
youngs
does
morris
have
how
many
cy
youngs
does
clemens
have
ballparks
and
such
fenway
average
pitchers
park
detroit
hugh
hitters
paradise
morris
is
a
great
team
pitcher
sort
of
in
the
doug
drabek
mold
if
morriss
team
needs
a
well
pitched
game
as
in
minn
in
morris
snaps
the
ball
and
throw
for
ks
otherwise
he
just
tries
to
get
people
out
as
for
clemens
in
the
elias
stat
book
of
i
believe
that
clemens
has
the
best
lifetime
record
for
his
team
as
compared
to
when
he
doesnt
pitch
how
bad
would
the
red
sox
have
been
last
year
without
him
can
you
say
phillies
i
believe
clemens
is
the
better
pitcher
because
of
more
power
and
hsi
great
tenacity
morris
is
among
the
guttiest
pitchers
ive
ever
seen
but
clemens
is
in
a
class
with
seaver
carlton
etc
paul
sparks
