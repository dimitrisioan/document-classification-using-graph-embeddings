chatting
about
the
best
player
of
all
time
is
pointless
you
cant
compare
players
from
different
eras
of
course
you
can
you
just
have
to
be
careful
about
what
conclusions
you
draw
if
you
will
notice
the
best
pitchers
stat
wise
were
in
the
and
and
the
best
all
around
hitters
probably
came
from
the
to
huh
the
and
were
the
worst
decades
for
great
pitching
grove
vance
dean
and
not
a
whole
lot
else
as
for
the
best
allaround
hitters
statwise
ruth
gehrig
foxx
greenberg
hornsby
cobb
etc
all
played
before
the
statwise
the
were
a
graveyard
for
hitters
now
we
have
a
great
number
of
great
pitchers
and
an
equally
great
number
of
great
hitters
and
fielders
also
how
do
you
know
which
ones
do
you
consider
great
about
fielding
the
gloves
were
much
smaller
than
they
are
now
in
the
early
years
of
baseball
maybe
a
hitter
like
sheffield
with
the
ba
and
rbieven
though
it
was
probably
a
fluke
year
can
be
compared
to
a
mantle
because
the
pitching
sheffield
faces
is
faster
and
not
to
mention
better
the
so
sheffield
also
has
better
shoes
more
time
between
pitches
you
can
run
the
comparison
but
there
are
lots
of
things
to
take
into
account
same
could
be
said
for
frank
thomas
who
is
said
to
be
the
best
hitter
since
ted
williams
although
franks
defense
does
suck
well
can
we
compare
them
or
cant
we
all
i
am
saying
is
that
you
cant
compare
players
from
different
eras
if
you
want
a
best
player
try
choosing
best
players
from
different
eras
that
why
we
can
compare
players
to
the
standard
of
their
era
and
we
can
keep
in
mind
eratoera
differences
without
throwing
up
our
hands
in
despair
way
there
is
reasonable
basis
for
comparison
you
havent
shown
us
whats
unreasonable
about
the
mantlesheffield
comparison
that
you
yourself
did
