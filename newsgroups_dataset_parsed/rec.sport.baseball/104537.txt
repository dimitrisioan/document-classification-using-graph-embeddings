TATE
WRITES
SUBSTITUTING
IRONY
FOR
BRAINS
BRUCE
KLOPFENSTEIN
SAID
DTATEPITTEDU
DAVID
M
TATE
WRITES
OF
COURSE
THEY
LEFT
RBIS
OFF
WERE
COMPARING
ALOMAR
THE
INDIVIDUAL
WITH
BAERGA
THE
INDIVIDUAL
SO
ONLY
INDIVIDUAL
STATS
COUNT
I
FORGOT
MOST
RUNS
ARE
SCORED
BY
PLAYERS
STEALING
HOME
SO
RBI
DONT
COUNT
FOR
ANYTHING
UH
RIGHT
YOU
ALSO
FORGOT
THAT
YOU
CANT
GET
AN
RBI
BARRING
A
HR
WITH
NOBODY
ON
BASE
WHAT
FRACTION
OF
ALL
RUNS
COME
ON
SOLO
HR
MOST
RUNS
ARE
SCORED
BECAUSE
THERE
HAPPENED
TO
BE
PLAYERS
ON
BASE
WHEN
THE
BATTER
DID
SOMETHING
GOOD
I
USE
THE
PHRASE
HAPPENED
TO
BE
ADVISEDLY
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
TRIED
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHO
THE
PLAYERS
ARE
WHO
HAVE
THE
MOST
ABILITY
TO
TURN
IT
UP
A
NOTCH
IN
CLUTCHRBIWHATEVER
SITUATIONS
AND
WHAT
THEYVE
FOUND
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
ANYONE
HAS
SUCH
AN
ABILITY
TO
ANY
MEASURABLE
EXTENT
THERE
ARE
NO
CLUTCH
HITTERS
PEOPLE
WHO
TEND
TO
DO
THINGS
THAT
WOULD
CAUSE
AN
RBI
IF
THERE
WERE
SOMEBODY
ON
BASE
END
UP
GETTING
RBIS
PROPORTIONAL
TO
HOW
MANY
OF
THEIR
TEAMMATES
OBLIGED
BY
BEING
IN
POSITION
MY
MISTAKE
I
AGREE
ME
TOO
RBI
ARE
A
WORTHLESS
STAT
OF
COURSE
SO
IS
STOLEN
BASES
BECAUSE
SOMETIMES
RUNNERS
ARE
IN
FRONT
OF
A
PLAYER
THAT
WOULD
OTHERWISE
RUN
AND
OF
COURSE
PITCHERS
PITCH
DIFFERENTLY
WITH
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
ON
DIFFERENT
BASES
SO
BATTING
AVERAGE
SLUGGING
AND
OBP
OUT
TOO
HMMM
I
GUESS
HOMERS
WOULD
NOT
COUNT
THEN
EITHER
MY
POINT
RBI
MIGHT
NOT
BE
A
PERFECT
STAT
BUT
NOTHING
IS
AND
NO
STAT
OR
LACK
OF
CAN
TELL
ME
THERE
ARE
NO
CLUTCH
HITTERS
MAYBE
NO
STAT
CAN
TELL
ME
EITHER
BUT
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
I
JUST
KNOW
IT
ED
