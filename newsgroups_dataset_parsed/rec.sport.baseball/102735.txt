it
depends
if
you
can
get
your
old
veterans
cheap
and
if
they
can
perform
at
a
higher
level
than
your
young
talent
can
now
why
not
the
talent
develop
in
the
minors
while
giving
the
fans
some
familiar
names
to
cheer
if
the
veterans
are
gone
in
a
year
or
two
that
should
be
just
about
right
maybe
someone
should
tell
those
renegade

in
denver
open

which
was
more
important
to
the
expansion
clubs
the
expansion
draft
or
the
regular

theyve
