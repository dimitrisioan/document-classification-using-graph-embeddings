WRITES
DURING
SPRING
TRAINING
I
MADE
A
SIMILARLY
INNONCENTLOOKING
COMMENT
ABOUT
CLUTCH
HITTING
ON
THIS
BB
AND
THE
FLAMES
WERE
FLYING
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
CLUTCH
HITTING
THEY
THE
SDCNS
ALL
SCREAMED
I
ASSUMED
THEY
ALSO
MEANT
THERE
WAS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
ANY
KIND
OF
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
GIVEN
THEIR
COMMENTS
IM
STILL
LICKING
THE
WOUNDS
BUT
I
DO
HAVE
A
REBUTTAL
PLANNED
GOTTA
DO
MY
HOMEWORK
AS
THEY
SAY
SOME
DELETIONS
RATHER
THEY
SHOWED
QUITE
CONVINCINGLY
THAT
PAST
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
ABLE
TO
PREDICT
FUTURE
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
IM
SURE
YOU
ARE
CONVINCED
DAVE
APPARENTLY
SO
IS
TONY
PEREZ
I
HOWEVER
AM
NOT
I
BELIEVE
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
SABO
PLATE
APPEARANCE
THAT
JUAN
SAMUEL
WAS
ON
THE
BENCH
AVAILABLE
FOR
PINCHHIT
DUTY
OVER
THE
PAST
FOUR
SEASONS
NONCLUTCH
CLUTCH
AB

SABO
SAMUEL
I
DO
NOT
CLAIM
THAT
THIS
IS
A
COMPLETE
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS
THAT
PROVES
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
CLUTCH
HITTING
OR
COMPELLING
TESTIMONY
THAT
SAMUEL
WOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
A
BASE
HIT
IM
SURE
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
WRONG
WITH
THE
SAMPLE
SIZE
OR
THAT
THE
BASIC
ASSUMPTION
THAT
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
IS
RANDOM
INVALIDATES
ANY
CONCLUSIONS
FROM
THIS
LIMITED
APPLICATION
OR
SOMETHING
OR
OTHER
I
DONT
PRETEND
TO
UNDERSTAND
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS
WELL
WE
AGREE
ON
THE
LAST
PART
ONE
OF
THE
BASIC
THINGS
YOU
NEED
TO
HAVE
IN
A
STATISTIC
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
PREDICT
A
PLAYERS
PERFORMANCE
ON
IT
IN
THE
FUTURE
IS
FOR
THERE
TO
BE
A
CORRELATION
FROM
YEAR
TO
YEAR
A
PLAYERS
BATTING
AVERAGE
IS
CORRELATED
FAIRLY
WELL
FROM
YEAR
TO
YEAR
A
PLAYERS
ABILITY
TO
WALK
OR
INFIELDERS
DEFENSIVE
AVERAGE
ARE
CORRELATED
BETTER
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
GIVEN
THEIR
PAST
PERFORMANCE
IN
THOSE
STATISTICS
WE
CAN
HAVE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
HANDLE
ON
HOW
THEYLL
DO
NEXT
YEAR
PUT
IN
SOME
SIMPLE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
AGING
AND
YOU
CAN
DO
EVEN
BETTER
ONE
OF
THE
BASIC
PROBLEMS
WITH
SOMETHING
LIKE
CLUTCH
BATTING
AVERAGE
OVERALL
BATTING
AVERAGE
IS
THAT
THE
CORRELATION
FROM
YEAR
TO
YEAR
IS
ALMOST
ZERO
ADDING
TO
THE
SAMPLE
SIZE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
HELP
MUCH
AS
A
COUNTEREXAMPLE
TO
WHAT
YOU
SHOWED
CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
TWO
PLAYERS
FROM
NONCLUTCH

MALDONADO
LEMON
IF
YOU
HAD
HAD
THESE
TWO
PLAYERS
IN
BY
YOUR
LOGIC
IN
THOSE
CLUTCH
SITUATIONS
YOUD
BAT
MALDONADO
FOR
LEMON
IN
A
BLINK
OF
AN
EYE
WELL
IN
MALDONADO
HIT
IN
NONCLUTCH
AND
IN
CLUTCH
WHILE
LEMON
HIT
IN
NONCLUTCH
AND
IN
CLUTCH
BEFORE
YOU
ACCUSE
ME
OF
COMPLETELY
COOKING
THE
DATA
THERE
WERE
PLAYERS
WHO
HAD
CLUTCH
AT
BATS
EVERY
YEAR
FROM
ACCORDING
TO
ELIAS
AS
A
SIMPLE
MEASURE
OF
CLUTCHNESS
LETS
JUST
LOOK
AT
CLUTCH
BANONCLUTCH
BA
IF
YOU
USE
TO
PREDICT
FOR
THOSE
PLAYERS
YOUD
FIND
THAT
OF
THE
WERE
BELOW
LEAGUE
AVERAGE
IN
THAT
MEASURE
BOTH
IN
AND
IN
WERE
ABOVE
LEAGUE
AVERAGE
IN
BOTH
PERIODS
AND
THE
OTHER
WERE
ABOVE
IN
ONE
AND
BELOW
IN
THE
OTHER
IF
YOU
WERE
JUST
FLIPPING
COINS
YOUD
EXPECT
TO
GET
ABOVEBELOW
IN
BOTH
AND
THAT
SWITCHED
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
OBSERVED
RESULTS
AND
THE
COIN
FLIP
EXPERIMENT
IS
NOT
STATISICALLY
SIGNIFICANT
BTW
CORRELATING
PLAYERS
OVERALL
BATTING
AVERAGE
FROM
WITH
GIVES
A
CORRELATION
COEFFICIENT
OF
WHICH
IS
SIGNIFICANT
AT
SOMETHING
BETTER
THAN
THE
CONFIDENCE
LEVEL
CORRELATING
THEIR
CLUTCHNONCLUTCH
BA
FOR
THE
SAME
PERIOD
GIVES
A
CORRELATION
OF
SIGNIFICANT
AT
NO
LEVEL
OF
ANY
INTEREST
EVERYONE
WOULD
AGREE
I
HOPE
THAT
A
GRAND
SLAM
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
NINTH
WHEN
YOUR
TEAM
IS
DOWN
BY
THREE
IS
A
VERY
CLUTCH
HIT
THERE
IS
JUST
NO
WAY
TO
PREDICT
WHO
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
GET
THE
CLUTCH
HIT
BASED
ON
PAST
PERFORMANCE
HITTING
IN
CLUTCH
SITUATIONS
IF
YOU
SAY
SO
DAVE
NO
WAY
ACTUALLY
ITS
TECHNICALLY
INCORRECT
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
CANT
PREDICT
FUTURE
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
ITS
MORE
CORRECT
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
CANT
PREDICT
FUTURE
CLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
