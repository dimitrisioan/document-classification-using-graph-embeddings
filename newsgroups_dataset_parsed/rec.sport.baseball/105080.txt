MY
SUPPOSITION
IS
THAT
IF
WE
WERE
TO
FIND
THE
SAME
PLAYERS
CONSISTENTLY
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR
AT
ONE
END
OF
THE
BELL
OR
THE
OTHER
THEN
WE
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
SOME
REASONABLE
CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT
THOSE
PLAYERS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
ALL
BASEBALL
PLAYERS
THIS
MAY
BE
THE
ROOT
OF
THE
CONFUSION
PLEASE
CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
HYPOTHETICAL
WITH
AN
OPEN
MIND
NOTE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
YET
SAYING
THAT
IT
HAS
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
QUESTION
AT
HAND
SUPPOSE
WE
HAVE
A
SIMPLIFIED
LOTTO
GAME
DETAILED
EXPLANATION
DELETED
INDEED
YOU
HAVE
STRUCK
RIGHT
AT
THE
HEART
OF
OUR
DISAGREEMENT
TO
REBUT
MY
OPINION
YOU
HAVE
MADE
AN
ANALOGY
WITH
A
GAME
OF
CHANCE
YOUR
HYPOTHESIS
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
LOTTO
PLAYERS
HAVE
NO
IMPACT
ON
THE
SELECTION
OF
THE
NUMBERS
AND
HENCE
THEIR
ABILITY
TO
WIN
WELL
THATS
CERTAINLY
TRUE
IN
LOTTO
BUT
IT
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
SPORT
OF
BASEBALL
WHEN
YOU
START
DOWN
THE
WRONG
PATH
YOU
FINISH
DOWN
THE
WRONG
PATH
I
REPEAT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
PRIOR
CLUTCH
HITTING
PERFORMANCE
IS
AN
ACCURATE
PREDICTOR
OF
FUTURE
CLUTCH
HITTING
PERFORMANCE
I
DO
HOWEVER
THINK
THAT
ANALYSIS
OF
PRIOR
CLUTCH
HITTING
PERFORMANCE
MAY
FOR
SOME
PLAYERS
INDICATE
A
DEFICIENCY
IN
THEIR
GAME
THAT
INDEED
WILL
PROVIDE
A
BASIS
FOR
PROJECTING
THEIR
PARTICULAR
FUTURE
PERFORMANCE
AND
I
THINK
CHRIS
SABO
IS
SUCH
A
PLAYER
THE
BEASTMASTER
