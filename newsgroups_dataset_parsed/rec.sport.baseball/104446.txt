WRITES
JACK
MORRIS
STARTS
HAVE
BEEN
LIKE
HIS
PLAYOFF
STARTS
HE
HAS
AN
ERA
OF
IN
HIS
STARTS
WHAT
DOES
LUCK
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
A
ERA
HE
WAS
LUCKY
TO
GET
WINS
LAST
YEAR
BUT
HE
HAD
AN
ERA
OF
WITH
A
TEAM
THAT
SCORED
A
LOT
OF
RUNS
I
WOULD
BE
HAPPY
IF
HE
COULD
STILL
PITCH
WITH
AN
ERA
OF
BUT
HE
SEEMS
TO
BE
SUFFERING
FROM
A
TOTAL
CALLAPSE
BAD
PITCHERS
ARE
MORE
PRONE
TO
THIS
TOTAL
COLLAPSE
THAN
GOOD
PITCHERS
THEY
ARE
CLOSER
TO
THE
CHASM
OF
MEDIOCRITY
THE
SMALLEST
PUSH
AND
THEY
COMPLETELY
LOSE
THEIR
GRIP
BUT
GOOD
ONES
CAN
COLLAPSE
SOMEWHAT
THEN
COME
BACK
THE
NEXT
YEAR
BURLEIGH
GRIMES
WENT
FROM
WINS
AND
AN
ERA
OF
OR
SO
IN
TO
AND
AN
ERA
AROUND
IN
HE
PITCHED
WELL
FOR
SEVERAL
MORE
YEARS
CARLTON
WON
AND
LOST
THE
YEAR
AFTER
HIS
RECORD
SOURCE
BILL
JAMES
HISTORICAL
BASEBALL
ABSTRACT
AND
LETS
NOT
FORGET
JOHN
TUDOR
WHO
STARTED
AND
FINISHED
IN
HE
HAD
A
PRETTY
BAD
ERA
WHEN
YOU
TAKE
BUSCH
STADIUM
INTO
ACCOUNT
AT
THE
START
OF
THE
SEASON
HE
GAVE
UP
EARLY
RUNS
IN
HIS
GAMES
AND
WOULD
GET
STRONGER
AS
THE
GAME
WENT
ON
THUS
GIVING
UP
FEW
RUNS
IN
THE
LAST
GOING
HE
STAYS
IN
THE
GAME
AND
GETS
THE
WIN
HOW
ELSE
WOULD
HE
HAVE
PITCHED
SO
MANY
INNINGS
YUP
HE
USED
TO
DIG
HIMSELF
A
HOLE
THEN
GET
IT
TOGETHER
AND
STICK
IN
UNTIL
THE
RUN
SUPPORT
EVENTUALLY
CAME
THROUGH
THIS
YEAR
HE
JUST
HASNT
GOTTEN
IT
TOGETHER
IF
I
RECALL
HE
HAD
A
ERA
IN
THE
HALF
AND
A
ERA
IN
THE
HALF
OF
LAST
YEAR
HMMM
RUNS
IN
INNINGS
SUPPOSE
HE
STARTS
MORE
GAMES
AND
WINDS
UP
INNINGS
PITCHED
IF
HE
ALLOWS
RUNS
A
GAME
IN
THE
NEXT
INNINGS
HELL
HAVE
A
ERA
OR
SO
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
YEAR
I
THINK
I
HAVE
HIS
TOTALS
RIGHT
THIS
IS
GOING
TO
BE
HARD
TO
COME
BACK
FROM
JACK
MAY
BE
FINISHED
IT
IS
TIME
TO
RETIRE
OR
BE
RELEASED
IF
HE
DOES
NOT
RETURN
TO
HIS
FORM
FROM
LAST
YEAR
HIS
MILLION
CONTRACT
IS
AN
AWFUL
LOT
TO
EAT
MY
HUNCH
IS
THAT
MORRIS
IS
VERY
GUTSY
AND
THAT
HE
MAY
BE
PITCHING
THROUGH
AN
INJURY
AND
NOT
TELLING
ANYONE
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
HE
WILL
BE
BANISHED
TO
THE
BULLPEN
THE
REMAINDER
OF
THE
SEASON
AFTER
A
FEW
MORE
STARTS
PERHAPS
WHEN
STEWART
COMES
OFF
THE
DL
OR
WILL
DANNY
COX
WHO
WENT
OR
SCORELESS
INNINGS
AGAINST
THE
TRIBE
TODAY
START
FOR
MORRIS
HE
LOOKS
LIKE
A
REALLY
GOOD
ONE
GASTON
IS
SCRAMBLING
TO
FIND
STARTERS
ID
IMAGINE
LUCKILY
THE
JAYS
HAVE
A
VERY
GOOD
OFFENSE
I
DONT
THINK
THEY
WOULD
DARE
RELEASE
HIM
BEFORE
THE
END
OF
THE
YEAR
HELL
JUST
BE
REPLACED
BY
STEWART
OR
COX
DOUG
FOWLER
ME
AGE
NOW
MOMMYS
AND
DADDYS
OTHER
EVER
WONDER
IF
AFTER
CASEY
RELATIVES
HAVE
TO
GIVE
LOTS
OF
HUGS
LOVE
MISSED
THE
STRIKE
IN
THE
POEM
SUPPORT
CAUSE
HEAVEN
IS
JUST
A
GREAT
HE
RAN
TO
FIRST
AND
MADE
IT
BIG
HUG
THAT
LASTS
FOREVER
AND
EVER
