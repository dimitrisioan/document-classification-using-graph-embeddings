seer
stephenson
picks
the
al
east
having
run
completely
out
of
time
ive
got
to
get
my
prophesies
and
predictions
for
the
al
out
qualifications
one
of
the
worse
finishes
in
last
years
prediction
contest
al
east
baltimore
orioles
why
the
orioles
well
i
pondered
long
and
hard
and
it
all
came
down
to
this
the
blue
jays
are
going
the
wrong
direction
cant
bring
myself
to
pick
the
yankees
milwaukee
was
a
fluke
indians
arent
ready
to
contend
red
sox
were
bad
last
year
and
didnt
get
any
better
detroits
pitching
will
be
the
new
definition
of
replacement
level
but
you
dont
really
think
the
orioles
will
win
do
you
no
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
cant
see
any
team
in
the
american
league
winning
either
division
on
paper
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
yankees
who
i
hate
but
some
body
has
to
win
so
i
pick
the
orioles
you
dont
really
think
that
brady
anderson
is
going
to
repeat
do
you
no
im
basing
the
orioles
prediction
on
the
expectation
of
big
years
from
cal
ripken
and
glenn
davis
glenn
davis
thats
insane
yes
so
without
further
ado
strong
points
hoiles
ripken
some
years
olson
getting
rid
of
billy
ripken
weak
points
segui
may
start
valenzuela
the
original
may
be
the
fifth
starter
oates
puts
his
best
hitters
at
the
bottom
of
the
lineup
does
anybody
else
think
that
might
be
a
calculated
maneuver
to
minimize
the
effect
of
a
slumping
ripken
if
you
cant
move
ripken
out
of
the
spot
why
not
move
the
rest
of
the
line
up
would
be
a
good
sign
glenn
davis
wins
comeback
player
of
the
year
would
be
a
bad
sign
in
a
tight
pennant
race
team
trades
for
pecota
obprediction
the
streak
continues
harold
reynolds
leads
the
team
in
caught
stealing
new
york
yankees
strong
points
abbot
key
perez
could
have
best
pitching
in
american
league
boggs
should
improve
on
hayes
weak
points
mattingly
still
considered
best
hitter
the
steinbrenner
factor
the
yankees
lost
to
the
mets
can
wholesale
changes
be
far
behind
never
count
on
rookie
pitchers
ie
wickman
millitello
to
win
a
division
would
be
a
good
sign
boggs
hits
over
would
be
a
bad
sign
howe
gets
arrested
again
obprediction
mattingly
wont
top
a
ops
toronto
blue
jays
strong
points
management
willing
to
make
big
deals
management
has
eerie
power
to

prospects
are
not
suspects
olerud

alomar
weak
points
the
jackson
for
bell
trade
has
shaken
my
faith
in
gillick
losing
stewart

hurt
rotation
thats
really
a
bad
sign
no
one
in
the
outfield
can
get
on
base
pitching
is
thin
behind
guzman
and
ward
would
be
a
good
sign
jack
morris
considered
cy
young
contender
in
august
would
be
a
bad
sign
club
makes
no
major
deals
in
august
obprediction
morris
will
post
better
era
and
whip
totals
than
last
year
and
have
a
losing
record
milwaukee
brewers
strong
points
pitching
staff

exceptional
last
year
weak
points
molitor
gone
surhoff
at

keep
it
up

be
a
good
sign
listach
and
eldred

like
last
year

be
bad
