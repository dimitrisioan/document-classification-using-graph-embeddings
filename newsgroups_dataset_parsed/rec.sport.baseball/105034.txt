STYLES
ALL
OF
THESE
WILL
GIVE
ME
SOME
ADVANTAGE
IF
USED
PROPERLY
WAS
PREDICTING
THE
FUTURE
THE
NEXT
AB
HE
WAS
PREDICTING
THAT
SABO
WAS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
GET
A
HIT
THAN
SAMUEL
HE
BELIEVED
ONE
OF
TWO
THINGS
SABO
WAS
MORE
LIKELY
THAN
SAMUEL
TO
GET
A
HIT
OR
THAT
MORE
GOOD
WOULD
BE
DONE
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
BY
LEAVING
SABO
IN
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
EXPECTATION
OF
THE
ACTUAL
OUTCOME
IN
FACT
YOU
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
PEREZ
HAD
IN
MIND
WHEN
HE
LEFT
SABO
IN
BY
SUPPORTING
THE
SWAP
YOU
ARE
PREDICTING
THE
OPPOSITE
IN
FACT
I
DONT
THINK
ANYONE
IS
CLAIMING
THAT
THEY
CAN
PREDICT
THE
FUTURE
OR
ANY
PARTICULAR
FUTURE
EVENT
BUT
WE
CAN
BELIEVE
THAT
CERTAIN
TRENDS
ARE
DUE
TO
A
CAUSE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
HAVE
IDENTIFIED
THE
CAUSE
AND
THEREFORE
WILL
CONTINUE
AND
I
AM
NOT
DISMISSING
YOUR
WORK
IM
STATING
MY
OPINION
YOU
ARE
SAYING
THAT
YOUR
WORK
RENDERS
ANY
OPINION
TO
THE
CONTRARY
INVALID
SO
THAT
THE
RETENTION
OF
THAT
OPINION
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
INSULT
TO
YOUR
WORK
WELL
YES
YOU
ARE
AWARE
OF
ITS
EXISTANCE
YOU
CLAIM
TO
BE
INCAPABLE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
IT
THOUGH
I
SUSPECT
YOU
ARE
SIMPLY
UNWILLING
YET
YOU
RATHER
FORCEFULLY
STATE
THE
OPPOSITE
YOU
DONT
SEEM
TO
THINK
THE
WORK
IS
WORTH
READING
YET
YOU
OBVIOUSLY
FEEL
THE
TOPIC
IS
IMPORTANT
ID
SAY
THIS
IS
INSULTING
I
THINK
SEEING
INSULTS
IN
OTHER
PEOPLES
OPINIONS
IS
KIND
OF
SILLY
AFTER
ALL
MARK
DIDNT
CALL
YOU
A
TOTAL
IDIOT
OR
CALL
YOUR
WORK
STUPID
HE
SIMPLY
STATED
THAT
IT
DIDNT
CHANGE
HIS
OPINION
ON
THE
SUBJECT
I
DID
NOT
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
A
CONSISTENT
SKILL
I
HAVE
SAID
THAT
IT
IS
AN
INDICATOR
OF
PERFORMANCE
UNDER
A
CERTAIN
SET
OF
CIRCUMSTANCES
RIGHT
THIS
IS
THE
BEEF
IT
HAS
NOT
PROVEN
TO
BE
AN
INDICATOR
OF
FUTURE
PERFORMANCE
UNDER
ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES
AT
LEAST
NONE
THAT
WEVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
IF
YOU
KNOW
OF
SOME
WHERE
IT
IS
AN
INDICATOR
OF
FUTURE
PERFORMANCE
PLEASE
LET
US
IN
ON
YOUR
SECRET
IF
PLAYER
A
HITS
BETTER
ON
TUESDAYS
AND
ALWAYS
HAS
AND
MARK
BELIEVES
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
AN
INDICATION
THAT
HE
WILL
HIT
ON
TUESDAY
BETTER
NEXT
SEASON
AS
WELL
WOULD
YOU
RESPOND
THE
SAME
WAY
AT
SOME
POINT
YOU
MIGHT
ADMIT
THAT
ALL
VARIABLE
MIGHT
NOT
BE
KNOWN
TO
YOU
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
THIS
GUY
DOES
EVERY
MONDAY
NIGHT
MAYBE
HE
SEES
HIS
SPORTS
SHRINK
ON
TUESDAY
MORNINGS
OR
HAS
HIS
VITAMIN
B
SHOTS
MONDAY
NIGHTS
BUT
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
THATS
TRUE
OF
ONE
GUY
ONLY
IT
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
A
MEANINGFUL
CORRELATION
FOR
THE
ENTIRE
LEAGUE
BY
DAYS
OF
THE
WEEK
NOR
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
BUT
IT
DOESNT
MEAN
WE
CANT
MAKE
PREDICTIONS
BASED
ON
THAT
FOR
THAT
PARTICULAR
PLAYER
I
BELIEVE
THAT
BY
SEASONS
END
THAT
CHRIS
SABOS
BATTING
AVERAGE
IN
CLUTCH
SITUATIONS
WILL
BE
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
THAN
HIS
BATTING
AVERAGE
IN
NONCLUTCH
SITUATIONS
I
CANT
PROVE
THAT
IT
WILL
HAPPEN
SO
I
GUESS
WELL
JUST
HAVE
TO
WAIT
AND
SEE
IS
THIS
SIMPLY
A
PREDICTION
FOR
CHRIS
SABO
FOR
THIS
YEAR
OR
IS
THIS
A
PREDICTION
FOR
ALL
BATTERS
WHO
HAVE
OVER
THE
PAST
FEW
YEARS
HIT
XXX
AMOUNT
WORSE
IN
THE
CLUTCH
THAN
OVERALL
I
ONLY
SEE
A
PREDICTION
FOR
ONE
PLAYER
HERE
I
DONT
SEE
ANYTHING
ABOUT
ALL
BATTERS
HERES
ANOTHER
ONE
FOR
YOU
IN
JOE
CARTERS
BATTING
AVERAGE
IN
CLUTCH
SITUATIONS
WAS
SIGNIFICANTLY
BELOW
HIS
BATTING
AVERAGE
IN
NONCLUTCH
SITUATIONS
EACH
YEAR
I
PRESUME
YOU
THINK
THIS
IS
RANDOM
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
GET
INTO
CASE
ANALYSIS
SURE
YOU
CAN
FIND
SOMEBODY
WHO
HIT
POORLY
FROM
AND
THEN
HIT
POORLY
IN
AS
WELL
YOU
CAN
ALSO
FIND
THOSE
WHO
HIT
POORLY
FROM
AND
THEN
HIT
WELL
IN
THATS
EXACTLY
WHAT
MARK
IS
TRYING
TO
DO
THOUGH
FIND
HITTERS
THAT
HAVE
THESE
CORRELATION
AND
ASK
WHETHER
WE
CAN
MAKE
PREDICTIONS
FOR
THESE
HITTERS
BASED
ON
THEIR
PAST
PERFORMANCE
MAJOR
LEAGUE
BALLPLAYERS
IT
JUST
MAKES
ME
THINK
THAT
IN
JOE
CARTERS
BATTING
AVERAGE
IN
THE
CLUTCH
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
AS
HIGH
AS
HIS
BA
IN
NONCLUTCH
SITUATIONS
GAMBLERS
FALLACY
UNLESS
THERE
IS
REASON
TO
EXPECT
CONSISTENCY
A
HUH
WHAT
DOES
GAMBLERS
FALLACY
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
ANYTHING
WHETHER
YOU
CAN
KNOW
THE
REASON
FOR
CORRELATION
OR
NOT
YOU
CANT
DENY
THAT
IT
HAS
EXISTENT
YOU
CAN
ONLY
MAKE
AN
ARGUMENT
THAT
YOU
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
LIKELY
TO
CONTINUE
TO
EXIST
BECAUSE
YOU
CANT
SEE
A
REASON
FOR
IT
TO
EXIST
RUN
PROVES
NOTHING
CAN
YOU
GIVE
US
A
REASON
TO
EXPECT
CLUTCH
BA
TO
CORRELATE
FROM
ONE
YEAR
TO
THE
NEXT
IVE
SEEN
A
DETAILED
STUDY
OF
SOMEONE
POSTED
RECENTLY
ON
WHY
NEGATIVE
CLUTCH
WOULD
CORRELATE
THE
ARGUMENT
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
STAR
PLAYER
WITH
LR
SPLITS
WILL
ALWAYS
SEE
AN
ADVERSE
CONDITION
IN
LATE
INNINGS
OF
A
CLOSE
GAME
IE
OPPOSING
MANAGER
WILL
ALWAYS
BRING
IN
A
AH
PITCHER
TO
FACE
HIM
WHERE
HIS
MANAGER
WILL
NOT
PULL
HIM
FOR
A
PH
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
YOU
CAN
DENY
IT
AS
FOR
TOTAL
IDIOT
YES
IF
YOU
PROVE
YOURSELF
UNWILLING
TO
EVEN
CONSIDER
EVIDENCE
THAT
MIGHT
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
ARE
WRONG
I
WOULD
SAY
THE
TERM
FITS
NICELY
SO
TELL
ME
DOES
THE
TERM
FIT
OR
DO
YOU
HAVE
AN
OPEN
MIND
WHAT
ABOUT
YOU
IF
THE
SHOE
FITS
WILL
YOU
WEAR
IT
WITH
AN
OPEN
MIND
