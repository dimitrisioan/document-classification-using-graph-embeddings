EVERY
SINGLE
PIECE
OF
EVIDENCE
WE
CAN
FIND
POINTS
TO
MAJOR
LEAGUE
BASEBALL
BEING
OFFENSE
DEFENSE
A
RUN
SCORED
IS
JUST
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
A
RUN
PREVENTED
THIS
CERTAINLY
PASSES
THE
COMMON
SENSE
TEST
FOR
ME
BUT
IS
THERE
ANY
STATISTICAL
EVIDENCE
TO
SAY
WHAT
PERCENT
OF
DEFENSE
IS
PITCHING
AND
WHAT
PERCENT
IS
FIELDING
ID
REALLY
LIKE
TO
KNOW
BTW
SHERRI
THANKS
FOR
THE
DA
DATA
I
FIND
IT
FASCINATING
OF
COURSE
A
RUN
SCORED
IS
JUST
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
A
RUN
PREVENTED
JUST
AS
A
PENNY
SAVED
IS
A
PENNY
EARNED
ENOUGH
WITH
THE
CLICHES
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
IF
THE
BRAVES
STARTERS
ARE
ABLE
TO
LIVE
UP
TO
THEIR
POTENTIAL
THEY
WONT
NEED
MUCH
OFFENSIVE
SUPPORT
I
REALIZE
THIS
IS
A
BIG
IF
THIS
STAFF
LEAVES
THE
BOSOX
IN
THE
DUST
THERE
IS
NO
LEGITIMATE
COMPARISON
TWO
CY
YOUNG
WINNERS
AND
THREE
OTHER
PITCHERS
THAT
MOST
ANY
TEAM
IN
THE
LEAGUE
WOULD
KILL
TO
HAVE
AS
THEIR
FIRST
OR
SECOND
STARTER
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WHEN
QUALITY
PITCHERS
TAKE
THE
MOUND
THE
OTHER
TEAMS
SCORE
LESS
RUNS
THE
TEAM
THAT
SCORES
THE
MOST
RUNS
WINS
THIS
PUTS
THE
TEAM
WITH
THE
BETTER
PITCHING
AT
THE
ADVANTAGE
PROVIDING
THEY
CAN
STOP
THE
OPPOSING
TEAM
FROM
SCORING
RUNS
A
LOW
SCORING
GAME
WOULD
CLEARLY
BENEFIT
THE
BRAVES
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
MANY
LOW
SCORING
GAMES
DUE
TO
THEIR
EXCELLENT
PITCHING
AND
BELOW
AVERAGE
HITTING
ON
THE
FLIP
SIDE
IF
YOU
HAD
A
STARTING
LINEUP
OF
GREAT
OFFENSIVE
PLAYERS
I
WOULD
BE
ARGUING
THAT
THIS
TEAM
WOULD
NOT
NEED
GREAT
PITCHERS
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
AN
ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE
THEY
COULD
SIMPLY
OUTSCORE
THEIR
OPPONENT
THE
NAME
OF
THE
GAMES
IS
TO
WIN
EVEN
RAY
KNIGHT
KNOWS
THAT
YOU
DO
THIS
BY
PUTTING
MORE
RUNS
UP
ON
THE
SCOREBOARD
ALL
IM
TRYING
TO
SAY
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
ASSEMBLE
THE
QUALITY
PITCHERS
LIKE
THE
BRAVES
HAVE
THE
OFFENSE
DOESNT
NEED
TO
BE
AS
STRONG
