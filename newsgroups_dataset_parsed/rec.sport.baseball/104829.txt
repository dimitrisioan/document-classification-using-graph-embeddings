PUNJABI
WRITES
AS
THE
HEADING
INDICATES
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
ME
TO
FATHOM
WHY
BARRY
IS
NOT
BATTING
FOR
THE
GIANTS
BEHIND
WILL
CLARK
BARRY
IS
SUCH
AN
AWESOME
AND
CONSISTENT
HITTER
DEFINITELY
THE
BEST
IN
THE
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
IMHO
TO
HAVE
WILLIAMS
A
STREAKY
HITTER
AND
NOT
REALLY
A
CLUTCH
HITTER
BATTING
AHEAD
OF
BONDS
IS
SIMPLY
AN
INJUSTICE
TO
THE
GIANTS
AND
FANS
OF
THE
GIANTS
SIMPLE
REASONS
HAVING
BONDS
BATTING
BEHIND
WILLIAMS
MEANS
THAT
MATT
WILL
GET
MORE
GOOD
PITCHES
TO
HIT
THIS
IS
IMPORTANT
SINCE
HE
STRUGGLES
SO
MUCH
WITH
BREAKING
BALLS
OPPOSING
PITCHERS
DONT
WANT
TO
WALK
WILLIAMS
TO
GET
TO
BONDS
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THIS
AT
ALL
MATT
WILLIAMS
HAS
DEMONSTRATED
THROUGHOUT
HIS
CAREER
THAT
HE
WILL
NOT
WAIT
FOR
GOOD
PITCHES
TO
HIT
HE
WONT
TAKE
WALKS
HED
RATHER
SWING
IF
IM
THE
OPPOSING
PITCHER
WHY
WOULD
I
GROOVE
A
FASTBALL
TO
WILLIAMS
AND
HAVE
HIM
HIT
IT
WELL
WHEN
I
KNOW
THAT
WILLIAMS
WILL
SWING
AND
MISS
OR
AT
LEAST
NOT
HIT
VERY
WELL
AT
A
LOW
AND
AWAY
