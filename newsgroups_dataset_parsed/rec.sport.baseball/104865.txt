all
of
these
divisions
based
on
race
religion
etc
make
me
sick
as
they
should
isnt
it
nice
that
mlb
is
finally
waking
up
to
their
existence
isnt
it
a
shame
that
hiring
practices
on
and
off
the
field
have
been
discriminatory
for
so
long
quick
name
a
lighthitting
black
outfielder
or
who
lasted
years
in
the
bigs
i
bet
you
can
name
two
dozen
white
ones
otis
nixon
darnell
coles
henry
cotto
manny
mota
a
dominican
b
not
all
that
lighthitting
lifetime
or
so
in
when
he
did
most
of
his
playing
c
professional
pinchhitter
after
that
yes
that
also
gives
you
jerry
hairston
billy
hatcher
beginning
year
now
herm
winningham
good
one
lonnie
smith
not
light
hitting
but
a
horror
in
the
field
not
the
same
thing
lots
of
people
are
bad
ofs
gary
redus
not
all
that
light
either
ops
dion
james
not
year
daryl
boston
this
year
vince

yeah
hes
finally
started
to

yup
gary
pettis
ok
milt

this
year
gary
varsho
sixyear
this
year
ok
i
admit
to
taking
a
quick
browse
through
the
major
league
handbook
but
only
after
the
first
or
oh
and
theres
the
alltime
lighthitting
black
outfielder
lou
brock
look
it
up
and
curt
flood
cesar
geronimo
brock
coleman
and
wilson
were
hotdog
basestealers
also
lonnie
smith
that
seems
to
be
a
special
class
cfs
like
pettis
and
wilson
also
get
more
of
a
break
especially
if
they
actually
do
field
well
and
brock
wasnt
all
that
bad
a
hitter
either
not
until
the
end
there
when
he
spoiled
his
ifetime
ba
and
again
i
suspect
thatthe
problem
is
lessening
over
time
but
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
the
last
three
decades
there
seems
to
be
a
clear
racebased
pattern
by
which
utility
players
and
platoon
players
and
lesser
talents
stayed
in
the
ml
far
longer
if
they
were
white
cesar
cedeno
light
hitting
hr
lifetime
ops
mainly
with
houston
also
latin
btw
note
these
guys
may
not
have
reached
years
yet
but
theyve
got
to
be
close
likewise
for
my
list
oh
and
a
prediction
milt
cuyler
come
back
in
and
well
partyhhhhh
talk
