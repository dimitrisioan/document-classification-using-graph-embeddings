WRITES
JOE
TORRE
HAS
TO
BE
THE
WORST
MANAGER
IN
BASEBALL
HES
NOT
THE
GREATEST
THIS
IS
TRUE
FOR
ANYONE
WHO
DIDNT
SEE
SUNDAYS
GAME
I
SAW
IT
WITH
A
RIGHT
HANDER
PITCHING
HE
DECIDES
TO
BENCH
LANKFORM
A
LEFT
HANDED
HITTER
AND
PLAY
JORDAN
AND
GILKEY
BOTH
RIGHT
HANDERS
LANKFORD
WAS
HURT
ALTHOUGH
THE
ANNOUNCER
SAID
HE
TOLD
TORRE
HE
COULD
PINCH
HIT
IF
THEY
NEEDED
HIM
TO
LATER
IN
THE
NINTH
INNING
WITH
THE
BASES
LOADED
AND
TWO
OUTS
HE
PUTS
LANKFORD
A
HITTER
WITH
POWER
IN
AS
A
PINCH
RUNNER
AND
USES
LUIS
ALICEA
A
HITTER
WITH
NO
POWER
AS
A
PINCH
HITTER
WHAT
THE
HELL
IS
HE
THINKING
I
WONDERED
THE
SAME
THING
BUT
GIVING
JOE
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
DOUBT
ID
SAY
HE
WAS
THINKING
THAT
LANKFORD
IS
HURT
ENOUGH
THAT
HE
DIDNT
TRUST
HIS
ABILITY
TO
BAT
EFFECTIVELY
BUT
HE
WANTS
HIS
SPEED
ON
THE
BASES
SO
PINCH
RUN
HIM
ALICEA
I
WAS
COMPLETELY
CONFUSED
ABOUT
MAYBE
HE
HAD
A
GOOD
RECORD
HITTING
AGAINST
THAT
PARTICULAR
PITCHER
I
DONT
KNOW
ANYBODY
GOT
AN
IDEA
EARLIER
IN
THE
GAME
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
ABOUT
ACQUIRING
MARK
WHITEN
HE
COMMENTED
HOW
FORTUNATE
THE
CARDINALS
WERE
TO
GET
WHITEN
AND
THAT
WHITEN
WOULD
BE
A
REGULAR
EVEN
THOUGH
THIS
MEANT
THAT
GILKEY
WOULD
BE
HURT
BUT
TORRE
SAID
HE
LIKED
GILKEY
COMING
OFF
THE
BENCH
GILKEY
HIT
OVER
LAST
YEAR
WHAT
DOES
HE
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
START
THE
GUY
WOULD
BE
STARTING
ON
MOST
EVERY
TEAM
IN
THE
LEAGUE
WELL
SO
FAR
I
HAVENT
SEEN
MUCH
TO
SAY
WHITEN
SHOULDNT
BE
PLAYING
BUT
IT
IS
TOO
BAD
THAT
GILKEY
IS
THE
ODD
MAN
OUT
WHEN
THEY
PLAY
JORDAN
AHEAD
OF
HIM
THAT
I
DONT
QUITE
UNDERSTAND
FURTHERMORE
IN
SUNDAYS
GAME
WHEN
LANKFORD
WAS
THROWN
OUT
AT
THE
PLATE
THE
REPLAY
SHOWED
BUCKY
DENT
THE
THIRD
BASE
COACH
LOOKING
DOWN
THE
LINE
AND
WAVING
LANKFORD
HOME
YUP
I
LOOKED
FOR
THIS
ON
THE
REPLAY
TOO
IF
IM
JOE
TORRE
IM
GOING
TO
HAVE
A
TALK
WITH
BUCKY
AFTER
THE
GAME
ON
THAT
ONE
HES
GOT
LANKFORD
AT
THIRD
WITH
TODD
ZEILE
I
BELIEVE
A
HOT
HITTER
COMING
UP
THERES
NO
REASON
TO
RISK
GIVING
LANKFORD
THE
GO
SIGN
IN
THAT
SITUATION
UNLESS
HE
WAS
SURE
THE
BALL
IS
GOING
TO
THE
STANDS
ITS
HIS
JOB
TO
WATCH
THE
PLAY
DEVELOP
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
LARKIN
WAS
THERE
TO
BACK
UP
A
BAD
THROW
THAT
SEEMED
INEXCUSABLE
IN
MY
BOOK
BTW
I
SAW
DENT
DO
THE
SAME
THING
LAST
YEAR
WITH
ZEILE
ROUNDING
THIRD
AND
GOING
INTO
A
SURE
OUT
AT
HOME
IN
A
CRITICAL
SITUATION
ON
THE
REPLAY
THERES
DENT
WAVING
HIM
AROUND
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THIS
MIGHT
BE
A
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
THE
CARDS
WERENT
GOOD
BASE
RUNNERS
AT
ALL
LAST
YEAR
AND
I
WONDER
HOW
MUCH
OF
THE
FAULT
LIES
IN
THE
BASE
COACHING
I
CANT
TAKE
THIS
ANYMORE
WELL
IM
STILL
HANGING
IN
THERE
