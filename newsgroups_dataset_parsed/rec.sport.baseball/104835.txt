RE
JACK
MORRIS
DID
ANYONE
HAPPEN
TO
SEE
PETER
GAMMONS
ON
ESPN
LAST
NIGHT
HE
ADDRESSED
THIS
EXACT
ISSUE
AND
DISMISSED
IT
RATHER
QUICKLY
ACCORDING
TO
GAMMONS
ADVANCED
SCOUTS
ARE
REPORTING
THAT
MORRIS
FASTBALL
AND
SLIDER
STILL
HAVE
THE
SAME
ZIP
AND
THAT
HIS
PROBLEMS
THIS
YEAR
ARE
DUE
TO
HIS
SUDDEN
INABILITY
TO
KEEP
THE
BALL
HIDDEN
DURING
HIS
RELEASE
GUZMAN
AND
STOTTLEMYRE
HAVE
GONE
THROUGH
SIMILAR
STRETCHES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
CLEARED
UP
SUCCINCTLY
BY
A
LITTLE
WORK
WITH
THE
PITCHING
COACH
GAMMONS
LOOKS
TO
SEE
MORRIS
BACK
IN
TOP
FORM
WITHIN
THE
MONTH
I
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
STILL
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
MORRIS
ERA
LAST
YEAR
WAS
RATHER
HIGH
FOR
A
PITCHER
WHO
WON
GAMES
HIS
SHOWING
IN
THE
SERIES
WAS
NOT
SURPRISING
ALTHOUGH
IM
NOT
CONVINCED
THAT
HES
WASHED
UP
I
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
AS
TO
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HE
CAN
EVER
REGAIN
THE
FORM
HE
HAD
FOR
THE
TWINS
IN
BRIAN
KLAFF
