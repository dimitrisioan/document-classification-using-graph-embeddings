a
modest
request
i
am
finding
the
volume
of
stuff
on
recsportbaseball
overwhelming
ca
postsday
an
effect
of
this
is
that
a
backlog
builds
up
and
many
posts
get
dumped
from
my
system
i
could
probably
fix
thatbut
dont
have
the
time
to
read
them
all
in
any
event
my
guess
is
that
mine
is
a
common
problem
i
have
some
ideas
that
would
help
each
person
generally
post
no
more
than
one
articleday
limit
the
extent
to
which
previous
posts
are
reproduced
in
posts
dont
post
mindless
woofs
or
antiwoofs
eg
the
jays
are
best
or
the
jays
suck
dont
respond
to
mindless
posts
eg
jack
morris
is
a
better
pitcher
than
frank
viola
because
hes
won
a
world
series
i
know
that
you
can
use
the
n
key
to
get
by
these
posts
but
they
bump
interesting
posts
from
my
disk
use
the
goddamn
shift
key
etc
it
makes
your
posts
easier
to
read
