WROTE
ISNT
IT
FUNNY
THAT
A
WHITE
PERSON
CALLS
COMEONE
A
NIGGER
AND
GETS
BANNED
FOR
A
YEAR
BUT
A
BLACK
PERSON
CALLS
SOMEONE
A
FAGGOT
AND
THERE
IS
NO
CONSEQUENCE
TED
TED
YOURE
MISSING
A
VITAL
POINT
AS
ROGER
LUSTIG
POINTED
OUT
IN
A
PREVIOUS
RESPONSE
THE
REASON
WHY
SCHOTT
WAS
BANNED
FROM
BASEBALL
WAS
BECAUSE
SHE
HAD
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
CALL
AND
THINK
IN
A
RACIALLY
BIASED
MANNER
ON
A
CONSTANT
BASIS
SUCH
THOUGHTS
AFFECTED
HER
HIRING
PRACTICES
BONILLA
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WAS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
MENTIONED
THIS
ONE
WORD
A
SINGLE
TIME
IF
HE
HAD
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
GO
AROUND
CRITICIZING
HOMOSEXUALS
IT
WOULD
BE
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
FURTHERMORE
HE
IS
MERELY
AN
ATHLETE
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
HIRE
ANYONE
AS
SCHOTT
HAD
TO
DO
DAVE
PALLONE
THE
FORMER
NL
UMPIRE
WHO
IS
AN
ADMITTED
HOMOSEXUAL
HAS
DECIDED
TO
ASSIST
IN
A
PROTEST
BEFORE
A
METS
GAME
AT
SHEA
HE
LIKE
YOU
THINKS
THAT
BONILLA
SHOULD
BE
SUSPENDED
FROM
BASEBALL
PALLONE
IS
HOPING
FOR
A
YEARS
SUSPENSION
IN
MY
OPINION
THATS
DOWNRIGHT
LUDICROUS
AS
HOWIE
ROSE
ON
WFAN
SAID
IF
YOU
START
SUSPENDING
ATHLETES
WHO
HAVE
MENTIONED
A
DEROGATORY
WORD
EVEN
A
SINGLE
TIME
UNDER
WHATEVER
CONDITIONS
THEN
YOUD
PROBABLY
HAVE
ENOUGH
PEOPLE
REMAINING
TO
PLAY
A
THREEONTHREE
GAME
NOW
HONESTLY
IF
YOU
TRULY
ANALYZE
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
CASES
THAT
YOU
BRING
UP
IN
YOUR
ARTICLE
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
YOUD
RECONSIDER
YOUR
THOUGHTS
SEAN
BEHIND
THE
BAG
VIN
SCULLY
