heres
the
hard

black

none
heres
the
lazy
white
players
mcreynolds
now
that
time
has
passed
what
would
the
posts
be
like
if
rickey
were
driving
his
boat
drunk
killing
himself
and
one
of
his
teammates
what
would
people
say
if
bonds
drunk
out
of
his
skull
smashed
his
car
into
a
tree
disabling
himself
say
willie
mcgee
for
the
season
i
can
tell
you
they
would
be
considered
spoiled
lazy
say
it
niggers
this
awfully
presumptious
of
you
to
assume
you
can
read
our
minds
and
predict
the
future
what
makes
you
so
sure
i
would
be
thinking
these
things
what
makes
you
think
that
theres
not
a
lot
of
people
out
there
dont
think
crews
is
a
god
anyone
who
is
dead
because
of
a
mistake
deserves
sympathy
be
it
crews
olin
bonds
mcgee
rickey
or
you
or
mewhy
does
it
bother
you
so
much
that
two
dead
white
men
are
getting
a
little
sympathy
would
it
make
you
feel
better
if
we
only
mourned
dead
black
baseball
players
to
beat
a
dead
horse
i
seem
to
remember
a
fair
amount
of
sympathy
for
some
black
fringe
player
named
roberto
clemente
and
for
roy
campanella
and
for
thurman
munson
and
for
just
about
anyone
else
who
we
may
not
even
have
liked
as
players
but
mourned
for
dying
too
young
wiggins
alan
but
thats
besides
the
point
im
sure
people
would
feel
slightly
sympathetic
for
rickey
if
he
were
killed
but
they
would
also
be
criticizing
him
a
lot
more
for
his
actions
example
how
about
jose
canseco
he
gets
a
couple
of
speeding
tickets
and
all
of
the
sudden
his
attitude
is
awful
what
the
hell
do
speeding
tickets
have
to
do
with
clubhouse
influence
anyway
so
why
do
sportswriters
talk
about
it
all
the
time
or
brian
hunter
and
keith
mitchell
both
of
whom
had
dwi
problems
towards
the
end
of
last
year
two
years
ago
it
was
cited
as
a
sign
of
their
immaturity
etc
meanwhile
dykstra
almost
killed
both
himself
and
daulton
and
i
didnt
read
any
sportswriter
complaining
about
that
they
may
have
talked
about
how
bad
it
was
for
the
phillies
but
i
never
read
anywhere
criticism
of
dykstras
character
or
daultons
intelligence
for
that
matter
based
on
this
incident
