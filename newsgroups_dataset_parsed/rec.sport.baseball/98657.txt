re
bring
on
the
os
i
heard
that
eli
is
selling
the
team
to
a
group
in
cinninati
this
would
help
so
that
the
os
could
make
some
real
free
agent
signings
in
the
offseason
training
camp
reports
that
everything
is
pretty
positive
right
now
the
backup
catcher
postion
will
be
a
showdown
between
tackett
and
parent
although
i
would
prefer
parent
draft
pick
jeff
hammonds
may
be
coming
up
faster
in
the
os
hierarchy
of
the
minors
faster
than
expected
mike
flanagan
is
trying
for
another
comeback
big
ben
is
being
defended
by
coaches
saying
that
while
the
homers
given
up
were
an
awful
lot
most
came
in
the
beginning
of
the
season
and
he
really
improved
the
second
half
this
may
be
bens
year
i
feel
that
while
this
may
not
be
mussinas
cy
young
year
he
will
be
able
to
pitch
the
entire
season
without
periods
of
fatigue
like
last
year
around
august
i
really
hope
baines
can
provide
the
rf
support
the
os
need
orsulak
was
decent
but
i
had
hoped
that
chito
martinez
could
learn
defense
better
and
play
like
he
did
in
the
os
right
now
dont
have
many
lefthanded
hitters
anderson
proving
last
year
was
no
fluke
and
cals
return
to
his
averages
would
be
big
plusses
in
a
drive
for
the
pennant
the
rotation
should
be
sutcliffe
mussina
mcdonald
rhodes
olson
is
an
interesting
case
will
he
strike
out
the
side
or
load
the
bases
and
then
get
three
pop
outs
you
never
know
the
way
i
see
the
al
east
this
year
with
personal
biases
mixed
in
baltimore
new
york
toronto
milwaukee
cleveland
boston
detroit
the
top
are
the
only
true
contenders
in
my
mind
one
of
these
will
definitely
win
the
division
unless
it
snows
in
hellmaryland
i
feel
that
this
baltimores
season
to
finally
put
everything
together
