at
times
it
seems
as
if
no
others
in
the
bullpen
are
used
by
cox
for
middle
relief
marvin
only
pitched
innings
this
spring
he
is
supposed
to
be
over
his
surgery
and
i
am
wondering
if
cox
is
still
trying
to
decide
who
to
use
as
middle
relief
and
thinks
that
marvin
might
be
his
better
choice
early
in
the
season
i
would
immediately
give
mcmchael
many
chances
to
pitch
after
spring
and
then
use
bedrock
and
freeman
after
that
i
am
wondering
how
he
intends
to
use
howell
whatever
happened
to
senior
smoke
do
you
mean
juan
berenguer
he
was
traded
for
mark
davis
in
the
middle
of
last
season
exchanged
one
stiff
for
another
as
berenguer
hadnt
come
back
from
his
injury
in
i
think
hes
retired
now
anyhow
as
middle
relief
marvin
aint
that
bad
he
at
least
can
pitch
a
couple
of
innings
or
do
mopup
work
i
dont
know
much
about
mcmichael
was
he
the
mexican
league
guy
but
everybody
else
in
the
pen
is
a
inning
man
except
maybe
mercker
eric
