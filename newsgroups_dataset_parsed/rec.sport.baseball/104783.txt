RE
WFAN
I
HOPE
THAT
THIS
COMES
OFF
AS
A
SOMEWHAT
UNBIASED
ASSESMENT
OF
WFAN
AND
WIPI
GO
TO
SCHOOL
IN
PHILADELPHIA
AND
I
LISTEN
TO
BOTH
STATIONS
ON
A
CONSISTANT
BASIS
NOW
THAT
THE
FAN
HAS
MIKE
LUPICA
ON
FROM
TO
NOON
THEY
HAVE
A
PERSON
WHO
CAN
GET
THE
BIG
NAME
GUESTS
FOR
INTERVIEWS
AND
NOT
JUST
OF
LOCAL
IMPORTANCE
HE
DID
HAVE
DAVE
CHEKETTS
AND
FRED
WILPON
ON
HIS
SHOW
BUT
HE
HAD
BOB
COSTAS
AND
MAGIC
JOHNSON
ON
TOO
NOW
HERE
ARE
MY
OPINIONS
OF
THE
TWO
STATIONS
COMPETING
TALENT
MORNING
SHOW
IN
MY
OPINION
I
THINK
IMUS
IS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
BRUNO
CATALDI
AND
MORGANTI
EVEN
THOUGH
I
WOULD
FEEL
DIFFERENT
IF
MORGANTI
HAD
A
BETTER
CREW
OF
PEOPLE
TO
WORK
WITH
TO
ME
WIP
TRIES
TO
COPY
IMUS
BUT
MAKE
IT
ALL
SPORTS
AS
A
THEME
IN
TERMS
OF
SPORTS
IMUS
LACKS
THE
BLANKETING
OF
THE
AIRWAVES
BUT
HE
INTERJECTS
HUMOR
AND
POLITICS
INTO
HIS
SHOW
AM
TO
NOON
I
THINK
CHUCK
COOPERSTEIN
AND
LUPICA
ARE
EQUAL
IN
THEIR
ABILITIES
TO
HOST
A
RADIO
SHOW
BUT
I
THINK
CHUCK
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OVER
LUPICA
IN
TERMS
OF
DEALING
WITH
THE
CALLER
WHO
IS
ASKING
ABOUT
WHO
THE
LOCAL
TEAM
IS
GOING
TO
DRAFT
IN
THE
SIXTH
ROUND
LUPICA
AND
THE
OTHER
HOSTS
ON
FAN
GET
BETTER
INTERVIEW
GUESTS
BUT
I
HEARD
THE
PD
OF
WIP
SAY
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
INTERVIEWS
WITH
CELEBRITIES
UNLESS
IT
WAS
A
MAJOR
STORY
I
WOULD
CONSIDER
THIS
EVEN
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
STYLES
OF
HOST
NOON
TO
PM
AT
THIS
POINT
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GIVE
A
BIG
ADVANTAGE
TO
JODY
MCDONALD
OVER
LEN
BERMAN
BECAUSE
LENNY
HAS
ONLY
BEEN
ON
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
I
JUST
THINK
JM
HAS
THE
ABILITY
TO
TRANSCEND
THE
HOMER
MENTALITY
OF
THE
PHILADELPHIA
FAN
BASE
THIS
IS
MOST
EVIDENT
WHEN
THE
IGGLESPHILADELPHIA
SPELLING
PLAY
THE
COWBOYS
BECAUSE
JM
IS
A
HUGE
DALLAS
FAN
WHERE
ELSE
CAN
YOU
HAVE
PEOPLE
CALL
UP
AND
PREDICT
A
SCORE
WITHOUT
THE
EGGING
OF
THE
HOSTSREWIP
MORNING
GUYS
I
DO
AGREE
THAT
JM
WAS
GREAT
ON
THE
FAN
WEEKEND
OVERNIGHT
AND
I
MISS
HEARING
HIM
OVER
THE
CURRENT
CROP
OF
ROTATING
HOSTS
I
FEEL
THAT
JM
IS
THE
BEST
SPORTSTALK
HOST
ON
EITHER
STATION
BY
A
GOOD
MARGIN
IF
YOU
ARE
IN
NY
AND
YOU
CANT
GET
WIP
JM
DOES
FILL
IN
ON
THE
WEEKENDS
SOMETIMES
TO
THIS
IS
THE
TIME
WHEN
JM
GOES
UP
AGAINST
FRANCESA
AND
RUSSOFATSO
AND
FROOT
LOOPS
AND
I
BECOME
THE
MOST
DIVIDED
IN
MY
LOYALTIES
MIKE
AND
THE
DOG
ARE
VERY
ENTERTAINING
BUT
THEY
OFTEN
GO
AN
HOUR
OR
SO
WITHOUT
CALLS
OR
EVEN
TO
MINUTES
WITHOUT
TALKING
ABOUT
SPORTS
MATD
DO
GET
GREAT
GUESTS
AND
THAT
IS
THE
BASIS
FOR
THEIR
SHOW
SO
IT
IS
LIKE
THE
TO
DEBATE
ANOTHER
PLUS
IS
THE
APPEARANCES
BY
MIKE
AND
CHRIS
ON
IMUS
IN
THE
MORNING
WHICH
ARE
OFTEN
HILARIOUS
PM
TO
PM
MATD
GO
UP
AGAINST
FREDERICKS
AND
MISSANELLI
I
LIKE
MIKE
MISSANELLI
BUT
I
JUST
CANT
STOMACH
STEVE
FREDERICKS
I
KNOW
THAT
SF
CAME
FROM
PHILLY
ORIGINALLY
BUT
WHEN
HE
WAS
AT
THE
FAN
HE
WAS
A
NY
HOMER
AS
MUCH
AS
HE
IS
A
PHILLY
HOMER
NOW
I
DONT
LISTEN
TO
WIP
MUCH
AFTER
PM
UNLESS
THERE
IS
A
GAME
ON
THAT
NIGHT
BUT
YOU
WILL
SEE
LATER
FOR
THE
REASON
THAT
IS
WHY
I
GIVE
THE
ADVANTAGE
TO
FAN
PM
TO
MIDNIGHT
SM
ARE
ON
WIP
UNTIL
AND
THEN
IT
IS
THE
MAN
WHO
MAKES
ELI
THAT
CALLS
MATD
ALL
THE
TIME
SEEM
LIKE
A
NOVICE
ON
CHARGES
OF
RACISM
G
COBB
THIS
MAN
IS
SO
GRATING
ON
MY
NERVES
THAT
IF
I
LISTEN
TO
HIM
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
I
GO
NUTSI
KNOW
THAT
IS
BIASED
BUT
LISTEN
TO
HIS
SHOW
ON
FAN
THERE
IS
USUALLY
A
GAME
ON
KNICKS
RANGERS
METS
JETS
OR
ST
JOHNS
BASKETBALL
IF
THE
GAME
IS
ON
THE
WEST
COAST
THEN
IT
IS
USUALLY
HOWIE
ROSE
OF
COURSE
I
THINK
DEAD
AIR
WOULD
BE
BETTER
THAN
G
COBB
ON
WIP
BUT
WIP
DOES
AIR
SIXERS
AND
FLYERS
GAMES
DURING
THE
SEASON
IF
THIS
IS
THE
SPORTS
STATION
WHY
DID
THEY
LOSE
THE
IGGLES
TO
WYSPHOME
OF
HOWARD
STERN
IN
PHIL
DURING
THE
SUMMER
IT
IS
ALL
TALK
ON
WIP
OVERALL
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GIVE
THE
ADVANTAGE
TO
WFAN
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
TO
AND
TO
WHERE
IT
IS
EVEN
AND
TO
WHERE
WIP
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
RICH
YOUVE
READ
THE
HAT
NOW
SEE
THE
MOVIE
IMUS
IN
THE
MORNING
A
BLURB
YOURE
A
BLURB
SEINFELD
