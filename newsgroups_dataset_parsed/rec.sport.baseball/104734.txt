being
an
old
time
cardinal
fannow
relocated
to
the
nva
areai
can
recall
that
harry
was
not
at
all
popular
with
old
man
busch
who
as
i
understand
it
fired
him
and
kicked
him
out
of
st
louis
i
am
not
quite
sure
of
the
reasons
but
the
old
man
was
certainly
not
enraptured
by
ole
harry
bern
odell
i
grew
up
listening
to
harry
carey
call
the
cardinals
games
and
really
liked
himthen
but
as
i
recall
he
was
fired
because
he
was
too
critical
read
honest
when
he
was
announcing
he
dared
to
point
out
the
cards
miscues
and
such
at
least
this
is
what
i
remember
from
when
i
was
a
kid
