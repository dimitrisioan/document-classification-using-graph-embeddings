BERNARD
ODELL
WRITES
BEING
AN
OLD
TIME
CARDINAL
FANNOW
RELOCATED
TO
THE
NVA
AREAI
CAN
RECALL
THAT
HARRY
WAS
NOT
AT
ALL
POPULAR
WITH
OLD
MAN
BUSCH
WHO
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
FIRED
HIM
AND
KICKED
HIM
OUT
OF
ST
LOUIS
I
AM
NOT
QUITE
SURE
OF
THE
REASONS
BUT
THE
OLD
MAN
WAS
CERTAINLY
NOT
ENRAPTURED
BY
OLE
HARRY
BERN
ODELL
I
GREW
UP
LISTENING
TO
HARRY
CAREY
CALL
THE
CARDINALS
GAMES
AND
REALLY
LIKED
HIMTHEN
BUT
AS
I
RECALL
HE
WAS
FIRED
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
TOO
CRITICAL
READ
HONEST
WHEN
HE
WAS
ANNOUNCING
HE
DARED
TO
POINT
OUT
THE
CARDS
MISCUES
AND
SUCH
AT
LEAST
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
REMEMBER
FROM
WHEN
I
WAS
A
KID
