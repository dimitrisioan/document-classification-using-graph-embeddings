WHO
THINKS
THE
ASTROS
ARE
GOING
PLACES
THEYRE
CURRENTLY
FIRST
PLACE
THEYRE
ON
THE
ROAD
I
AGREE
LUMBERJACK
EXCEPT
THAT
THEYRE
IN
THEY
ARE
GOING
PLACES
SAN

LOS
ANGELES
SAN

CINCINNATI
DENVER
ATLANTA
MIAMI
PHILADELPHIA

MONTREAL
PITTSBURGH
CHICAGO
ST

POINTS
IN
BETWEEN
BUT
THEYRE
AT
HOME
BUT
THEY
FACED
THE
PHILLIES
A
TEAM
THAT
GOT
OFF
TO
AN
START
IM
JUST
NOT
USED
TO
AN
OVERLY
ENTHUSIASTIC
HOUSTON
FAN
I
REALLY
SHOULDNT
DISCOURAGE
IT
SO
HANG
IN
THERE
LUMBERJACK
BUT
GET
AHOLD
OF
THAT
SHIFT
KEY
WILL
YA
OBBASE
APPARENTLY
THE
NEW
OWNER
DRAYTON
MCLAIN
SP
DOESNT
PARTICULARLY
LIKE
EXCUSES
AN
ITEM
IN
OUR
PAPER
THE
AUSTIN
AMERICANSTATESMAN
IF
YOU
READ
IT
HERE
IT
WAS
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
FIRST
SAID
THAT
HE
WOULDNT
TAKE
INJURIES
AS
AN
EXCUSE
FOR
LOSING
BECAUSE
THAT
POSSIBILITY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ACCOUNTED
FOR
UH
OH
I
DONT
WANT
AN
OWNER
THATLL
KEEP
EVERYBODY
ON
EDGE
ID
NEVER
GOTTEN
THAT
FEELING
ABOUT
HIM
BUT
WHO
KNOWS
DOES
TO
BE
HONEST
I
THINK
THE
CITY
OF
HOUSTON
LOVES
THE
NEW
OWNER
HE
HAS
BROUGHT
BASEBALL
BACK
TO
HOUSTON
WITH
KEY
ACQUISITIONS
PLAYERS
THAT
WERE
FROM
THE
HOUSTON
AREA
AND
WANTED
TO
PLAY
FOR
THE
ASTROS
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
FEARFUL
THAT
MCLANE
WILL
MEDDLE
IN
THE
TEAM
AS
HE
HAS
ALREADY
ADMITTED
THAT
HE
DOESNT
KNOW
A
WHOLE
LOT
ABOUT
BASEBALL
MCLANE
IS
A
BUSINESSMAN
AND
DOESNT
LIKE
EXCUSES
HE
MAKES
A
VALID
POINT
THAT
INJURIES
SHOULDNT
BE
AN
EXCUSE
TO
THIS
CLUB
LOOK
AT
THE
DEPTH
OF
THE
BENCH
THIS
SEASON
CANADELE
CAN
PLAY
POSITIONS
BASS
AND
JAMES
ARE
SOLID
OUTFIELDERS
AND
CAN
HIT
WELL
TOO
URIBE
IS
NICE
TO
HAVE
AS
WELL
THE
PITCHING
STAFF
HAS
LEGITIMATE
STARTERS
WERE
DEALING
WITH
A
YOUNG
HOUSTON
TEAM
SO
INJURIES
SHOULDNT
PLAY
A
BIG
ROLE
THE
ONLY
THREAT
IS
THE
BULLPEN
IF
JONESY
GOES
OUT
WE
MAY
BE
IN
TROUBLE
BUT
WITH
THE
TYPE
OF
STARTERS
WE
HAVE
THIS
SEASON
THERE
IS
LESS
PRESSURE
ON
THE
PEN
