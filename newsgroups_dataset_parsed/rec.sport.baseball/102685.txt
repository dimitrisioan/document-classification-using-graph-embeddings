MSSNETCOMCOM
MARK
SINGER
SAID
WE
KNOW
THAT
VERY
VERY
FEW
PLAYERS
AT
THIS
AGE
MAKE
MUCH
OF
AN
IMPACT
IN
THE
BIGS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THEY
HAVENT
EVEN
PLAYED
AAA
BALL
YES
BUT
THIS
IS
IRRELEVANT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
AVERAGES
WHEN
WE
HAVE
LOTS
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THIS
PLAYER
IN
PARTICULAR
TO
BASE
OUR
DECISIONS
ON
DO
YOU
REALLY
HAVE
THAT
MUCH
INFORMATION
ON
HIM
REALLY
WHY
ISNT
LOPEZ
LIKELY
TO
HIT
THAT
WELL
HE
HIT
THAT
WELL
LAST
YEAR
AFTER
ADJUSTING
HIS
STATS
FOR
PARK
AND
LEAGUE
AND
SUCH
HE
HIT
BETTER
ON
AN
ABSOLUTE
SCALE
THAN
OLSON
OR
BERRYHILL
DID
BY
A
LOT
I
DONT
KNOW
YOU
TELL
ME
WHAT
PERCENTAGE
OF
PLAYERS
REACH
OR
EXCEED
THEIR
MLES
IN
THEIR
ROOKIE
SEASON
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
YOU
KNOW
AS
FOR
RUSHING
IF
THERE
REALLY
IS
A
QUALITATIVE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
MINORS
AND
THE
MAJORS
THAT
REQUIRES
A
PERIOD
OF
ADJUSTMENT
AND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
THEN
WOULDNT
YOU
RATHER
WASTE
LOPEZS
OLD
GOOD
SEASON
THAN
HIS
OLD
VERY
GOOD
SEASON
OR
HIS
EXCELLENT
SEASON
THE
SOONER
YOU
GET
HIM
ACCLIMATED
THE
MORE
OF
HIS
PRIME
YOU
GET
TO
USE
IF
THAT
WERE
YOUR
PURPOSE
MAYBE
OFFERMAN
SPENT
GETTING
ACCLIMATED
IF
YOU
WILL
THE
DODGERS
AS
A
TEAM
PAID
A
BIG
PRICE
THAT
SEASON
PERHAPS
THEY
WILL
REAP
THE
BENEFITS
DOWN
THE
ROAD
DO
YOU
REALLY
THINK
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
WHAT
THEY
DID
IF
THEY
WERE
COMPETING
FOR
A
PENNANT
LOPEZ
WAS
HITTING
OVER
AB
WHEN
HE
WAS
CUT
FROM
SPRING
TRAINING
WHAT
DOES
HE
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
EARN
A
CHANCE
MAYBE
NOT
A
FULL
TIME
JOB
BUT
AT
LEAST
A
COUPLE
STARTS
AND
A
FEW
AB
FOR
HIM
TO
PROVE
HIS
WORTH
THE
POINT
WAS
NOT
THAT
AB
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
SAMPLE
BUT
RATHER
THAT
HE
HADNT
DONE
ANYTHING
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
TO
CAUSE
EVEN
A
BLOCKHEAD
MANAGER
TO
QUESTION
WHETHER
HIS
MINOR
LEAGUE
NUMBERS
WERE
FOR
REAL
OR
TO
SEND
HIM
DOWN
UNTIL
HE
GETS
WARMED
UP
FOR
A
STATHEAD
IM
AMAZED
THAT
YOU
PUT
ANY
CREDENCE
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
DID
YOU
NOTICE
WHO
HE
GOT
THOSE
HITS
OFF
OF
OR
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
TELL
ME
THAT
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
THE
KID
WILL
IMPROVE
PLAYING
AT
AAA
JUST
LIKE
KEITH
MITCHELL
DID
WAIT
A
MINUTE
I
MISSED
SOMETHING
HERE
FIRST
FORGET
KEITH
MITCHELL
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
A
KID
WHO
MOVES
FROM
AA
TO
AAA
AND
THEN
DOES
NOT
IMPROVE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BETTER
OFF
MAKING
A
DIRECT
LEAP
TO
THE
MAJORS
IF
A
PLAYER
DOES
WELL
AT
AA
AND
THEN
DOES
NOT
IMPROVE
AT
AAA
ISNT
THAT
A
SIGN
THAT
MAYBE
HE
DOESNT
BELONG
IN
THE
BIGS
NOW
KEITH
MITCHELL
AS
I
RECALL
NO
STAT
BOOKS
HANDY
SURPRISE
HE
JUMPED
FROM
AA
TO
ATLANTA
IN
HE
DID
SO
WELL
THAT
HE
WAS
RETURNED
TO
THE
MINORS
WHERE
HE
DIDNT
DO
VERY
WELL
AT
ALL
NOW
HIS
CAREER
IS
IN
JEOPARDY
SO
HOW
DOES
HE
FIT
IN
WITH
YOUR
POINT
GOOD
MLES
IN
AA
MOVED
HIM
RIGHT
TO
THE
BIG
CLUB
NOW
HES
ONE
STEP
AWAY
FROM
BEING
TRADED
OR
MOVED
OUT
OF
BASEBALL
DUH
THAT
WAS
ME
AND
YOU
SO
FAR
YOUR
ONLY
COUNTERPROPOSAL
IS
THAT
THEY
REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
GOOD
LOPEZ
IS
OR
OVERVALUE
EXPERIENCE
OR
SOME
COMBINATION
OF
THE
TWO
I
THINK
MY
INTERPRETATION
WAS
MORE
FLATTERING
TO
THE
ORGANIZATION
WELL
IVE
CAST
MY
LOT
CERTAINLY
YOU
MAY
UNDERSTAND
BETTER
HOW
GOOD
LOPEZ
IS
AND
I
MAY
OVERVALUE
EXPERIENCE
BUT
NEITHER
ONE
OF
US
RUNS
A
BASEBALL
TEAM
