G
WILLIAMS
SENT
DOWN
YANKS
WIN
AL
EAST
WELL
IT
REALLY
ISNT
THIS
CUT
AND
DRY
BUT
AS
A
JAY
FAN
THE
THING
I
FEARED
WORST
HAS
HAPPENED
THE
YANKS
SENT
DOWN
WILLIAMS
G
AND
ARE
GOING
TO
START
WILLIAMS
B
IN
CF
I
ALSO
BELIEVE
THEY
KEPT
WICKMAN
AND
MILLITELLO
IN
THEIR
ROTATION
WHICH
IS
MUCH
NICER
THAN
THAT
KAMINIECKI
AND
MIKE
WITT
COMBO
I
THOUGHT
THEYD
THROW
OUT
THEIR
TO
THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
EXPERIENCE
GRANTED
WITT
MIGHT
BE
GOOD
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
USED
RATIONALE
TO
KEEP
THE
YOUNGSTERS
UP
AND
NOT
GIVEN
THE
JOB
TO
WITT
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
A
GOOD
PITCHER
AND
HAS
EXPERIENCE
THE
YANKS
ARE
SHOWING
THAT
THEY
ARE
TAKING
POSITIVE
STRIDES
FORWARDS
THE
JAYS
WITH
THE
LOSS
OF
DAVE
STEWART
ARE
LOOKING
AT
GIGANTIC
HOLES
IN
THEIR
PITCHING
STAFF
THE
ORIOLES
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
THERE
IN
THE
END
GORD
NIGUMA
TO
SALVAGE
THE
SEASON
LET
JJ
OLERUD
WIN
MVP
