THE
PHILLIES

I
THINK
MOST
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
MAINLY
AROSE
FROM
MANAGER
GENE
MAUCHS
INEPTITUDE
IN
MANAGING
THE
PITCHING
STAFF
DOWN
THE
STRETCH
HE
ABUSED
JIM
BUNNING
CHRIS
SHORT
AND
ROBIN
ROBERTS
I
THINK
THOSE
ARE
THE
THREE
PITCHING
EACH
ON
ONLY
DAYS
REST
FOR
QUITE
SOME
TIME
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
HIT
THE
LAST
WEEKS
OF
THE
SEASON
OBVIOUSLY
NONE
OF
THESE
GUYS
HAD
AN
OUNCE
LEFT
IN
THEIR
ARM
OH
WELL
ROBERTS
WAS
LONG
GONE
HE
WAS
PROBABLY
AN
ORIOLE
IN
OR
MAYBE
A
COLT
THE
STARTER
WAS
ART
MAHAFFEY
THE
PREVIOUS
YEARS
ACE
DENNIS
BENNETT
WAS
THE
STARTER
THEY
WERE
INDEED
UP
WITH
TO
GO
BUT
THEY
WON
THEIR
FINAL
TWO
GAMES
AFTER
THE
HORRID
STREAK
THE
FINAL
GAME
VICTORY
BUNNINGS
WIN
IF
MEMORY
SERVES
KEPT
THE
REDS
FROM
TYING
FOR
THE
TITLE
THEY
AND
THE
PHILS
WERE
BOTH
GAME
BEHIND
THE
CARDS
WITH
THE
GIANTS
ANOTHER
GAME
BACK
THE
METS
COULDNT
HOLD
AN
EARLY
LEAD
AGAINST
THE
CARDS
THAT
FINAL
SUNDAY
OR
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
TIE
TOO
BAD
THEY
COULDNT
HAVE
SAVED
SOME
OF
THE
OR
SO
RUNS
THEY
SCORED
ON
SATURDAY
WHEN
THEY
CRUSHED
ST
LOUIS
NEAL
TRAVENPITTEDU
YOURE
ONLY
YOUNG
ONCE
BUT
YOU
CAN
BE
TRAVENVMSCISPITTEDU
IMMATURE
FOREVER
