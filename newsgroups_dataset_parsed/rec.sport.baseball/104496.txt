RE
DODGER
QUESTION
THE
DODGERS
HAVE
BEEN
SHOPPING
HARRIS
TO
OTHER
TEAMS
IN
THEIR
QUEST
FOR
MORE
LEFTHANDED
PITCHING
SO
FAR
NO
TAKERS
PERSONALLY
I
THINK
HARRIS
IS
A
DEFENSIVE
LIABILITY
AND
HE
HAS
ALSO
LED
THE
TEAM
IN
PAST
YEARS
FOR
HITTING
INTO
DOUBLE
PLAYS
OR
AT
LEAST
BEEN
AMONG
THE
LEADERS
SHARPERSON
SHOWED
LAST
YEAR
THAT
IF
GIVEN
A
CHANCE
TO
PLAY
EVERY
DAY
HE
CAN
GET
THE
JOB
DONE
IF
SHARPY
PLAYED
JUST
ONE
BASE
EVERY
DAY
SAY
THIRD
HED
ALSO
IMPROVE
DEFENSIVELY
WALLACH
HAS
HELPED
TREMENDOUSLY
ON
DEFENSE
AS
HAS
REED
THE
IMPROVED
DEFENSE
IS
QUITE
NOTICEABLE
AND
IS
HAVING
AN
EFFECT
ON
THE
PITCHING
STAFF
BOTH
ASTACIO
AND
MARTINEZ
WERE
BAILED
OUT
IN
RECENT
STARTS
BY
GREAT
DEFENSIVE
PLAYS
MARTINEZ
PITCHED
INTO
THE
NINTH
IN
A
GAME
THAT
MIGHT
HAVE
SEEN
HIM
LIFTED
IN
THE
THIRD
IN
PAST
YEARS
ASTACIO
LASTED
INNINGS
THE
OTHER
DAY
UNDER
SIMILAR
CIRCUMSTANCES
THE
DODGERS
ARE
TURNING
DOUBLE
PLAYS
AND
KEEPING
MORE
BALLS
IN
THE
INFIELD
THAN
LAST
YEAR
AND
PIAZZA
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
GREAT
ON
DEFENSE
HE
HAS
THROWN
OUT
OF
BATTERS
TRYING
TO
STEAL
AND
HAS
AT
LEAST
ONE
PICK
OFF
AT
FIRST
WALLACH
CLEARLY
HAS
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
OVER
ALL
IMPROVEMENT
ON
DEFENSE
BUT
HIS
OFFENSE
IS
AWFUL
AND
HE
HAS
COST
THE
DODGERS
SOME
RUNS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
HE
IS
AS
BAD
AS
HIS
CURRENT
AVERAGE
I
SUSPECT
HE
WILL
COME
OUT
OF
THIS
SLUMP
MUCH
AS
DAVIS
AND
STRAW
SEEM
TO
HAVE
COME
OUT
OF
THEIRS
DODGER
