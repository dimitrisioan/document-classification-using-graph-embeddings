WRITES
OF

THEY
LEFT
RBIS

WERE
COMPARING
ALOMAR
THE
INDIVIDUAL
WITH
BAERGA
THE
INDIVIDUAL
SO
ONLY
INDIVIDUAL
STATS
COUNT
I
FORGOT
MOST

BARRING
A
HR
WITH
NOBODY
ON

WHAT
FRACTION
OF
ALL
RUNS
COME
ON
SOLO
HR
MOST
RUNS
ARE
SCORED
BECAUSE
THERE
HAPPENED
TO
BE

WHEN
THE

SOMETHING
GOOD
I
USE
THE
PHRASE
HAPPENED

BE
ADVISEDLY
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
TRIED
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHO
THE
PLAYERS
ARE
WHO
HAVE
THE
MOST
ABILITY
TO
TURN
IT
UP
A
NOTCH
IN
CLUTCHRBIWHATEVER
SITUATIONS
AND
WHAT
THEYVE
FOUND
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
ANYONE
HAS
SUCH
AN
ABILITY
TO
ANY
MEASURABLE
EXTENT
THERE
ARE
NO
CLUTCH
HITTERS
PEOPLE
WHO
TEND
TO
DO
THINGS
THAT
WOULD
CAUSE
AN
RBI
IF
THERE
WERE
SOMEBODY
ON
BASE
END
UP
GETTING
