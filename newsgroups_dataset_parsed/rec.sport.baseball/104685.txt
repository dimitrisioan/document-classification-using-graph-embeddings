RE
SO
FAR
SO
GOOD
THE
RED
SOX
WIZARD
WRITES
I
HAVE
POSTED
TWO
NEW
POSTINGS
ON
THE
NET
SINCE
I
DISCOVERED
HOW
TO
USE
IT
AND
BOTH
TIMES
I
RECEIVED
REDICULE
FOR
PREDICTING
THE
RED
SOX
AS
HIGH
AS
THIRD
IN
THE
AL
EAST
ID
LIKE
TO
HEAR
WHY
IT
IS
PEOPLE
DONT
THINK
THE
SOX
CAN
BE
AS
HIGH
AS
THIRD
THIS
YEAR
HERE
ARE
SOME
OF
MY
OBSERVATIONS
WELL
HAD
YOU
BEEN
A
BIT
LESS
EXUBERANT
IN
BOTH
THE
TONE
AND
SUBSTANCE
OF
YOUR
PREDICTIONS
THE
RESPONSES
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
BEEN
A
BIT
MORE
MEASURED
BE
THAT
AS
IT
MAY
ROGER
AND
FRANK
ARE
IN
VINTAGE
FORM
AND
THE
SOX
ARE
RRESPONDING
TO
THEM
CLEMENS
IS
ALWAYS
IN
THIS
FORM
AND
VIOLA
ISNT
REALLY
PERFORMING
BEYOND
WHAT
MIGHT
REASONABLY
HAVE
BEEN
EXPECTED
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THE
SOX
ARE
RESPONDING
TO
THEM
AND
NOT
TO
AL
BUMBRY
HOBSON
OR
MY
MOST
LIKELY
SUSPECT
NEW
HITTING
COACH
MIKE
EASLER
I
CERTAINLY
AM
MORE
LIKELY
TO
GIVE
EASLER
CREDIT
FOR
MO
VAUGHHNS
HOT
START
THAN
CLEMENS
OR
VIOLA
GREENWELL
IS
HITTING
AS
HE
DID
BEFORE
HIS
INJURIES
THIS
WAS
THE
OPTIMISTIC
SCENARIO
BUT
NOT
UNREASONABLY
SO
HE
HASNT
SHOWN
MUCH
POWER
YET
THOUGH
DAWSON
IS
PROVIDING
THE
LEADERSHIP
AND
SOME
HITTING
THEY
NEED
FROM
HIM
HOW
CAN
YOU
TELL
THAT
DAWSON
IS
PROVIDING
THE
LEADERSHIP
PERHAPS
ITS
CALDERON
PERHAPS
ITS
CLEMENS
AND
VIOLA
MAYBE
HOBSON
IS
FINALLY
SHOWING
THOSE
PEOPLE
SKILLS
HE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
WHEN
THEY
HIRED
HIM
OR
MAYBE
ITS
ALL
A
MYTH
AND
DAWSON
HAS
BEEN
HITTING
REASONABLY
WELL
BUT
NOT
AS
WELL
AS
GREENWELL
VAUGHN
COOPER
OR
FLETCHER
RUSSELL
IS
FINISHING
WELL
IN
THREE
GAMES
WHY
DONT
WE
LOOK
AT
THIS
ONE
AGAIN
IN
SAY
JULY
FLETCHER
IS
HITTING
WELL
AS
A
LEADOFF
HITTER
A
BIT
BETTER
THAN
COULD
REASONABLY
HAVE
BEEN
EXPECTED
BUT
DONT
FORGET
THAT
ZUPCIC
LOOKED
LIKE
WADE
BOGGS
LITE
FOR
ABOUT
ABS
LAST
YEAR
BEWARE
OF
SMALL
SAMPLE
SIZES
STILL
IF
FLETCHER
HITS
AS
WELL
AS
HE
DID
LAST
YEAR
HED
BE
A
GREAT
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
ANY
SOX
LEADOFF
HITTER
FROM
LAST
YEAR
BE
AWARE
THAT
HIS
CAREER
NUMBERS
SEEM
TO
INDICATE
THAT
HE
PUTS
UP
GOOD
NUMBERS
AS
LONG
AS
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
MAKE
MORE
THAN
AB
OR
SO
IN
A
YEAR
COOPER
IS
HITTING
WELL
I
THINK
HELL
BE
BETTER
THEN
BOGGS
IN
THE
FIELD
AND
JUST
AS
GOOD
AT
THE
PLATE
UMMMSORRY
NO
I
CAN
BUY
THE
IN
THE
FIELD
PART
AND
I
THINK
HELL
BE
BETTER
AT
THE
PLATE
THAN
THE
BOGGS
BUT
IN
GENERAL
COOPER
WHILE
HELL
BE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
HITTER
COULDNT
CARRY
BOGGS
JOCKSTRAP
WITH
A
LITTLE
LUCK
HE
COULD
BE
THE
FOURTH
OR
FIFTH
BEST
IN
THE
AL
MARTINEZ
BOGGS
VENTURA
AND
PALMER
WILL
ALL
BE
BETTER
IF
THE
SOX
PITCH
LIKE
LAST
YEAR
THEY
HAVE
A
BETTER
PITCHIONG
STAFF
NOW
AND
HIT
LIKE
THEY
ARE
SO
FAR
THEY
COIULD
RUN
AWAY
WITH
THEE
DIVISION
BUT
SINCE
I
THINK
THAT
THEIR
HITTING
AND
PITCHING
MAY
NOT
BE
UP
TO
THE
CHALLENGE
OF
RUNNING
AWAY
WITH
THE
DIVISION
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
WIN
BE
OVER
AND
AT
LEAST
THIRD
IF
NOT
SECOND
OR
FIRST
SEE
HERE
IS
WHERE
YOU
MAKE
THAT
QUICK
LEFT
TURN
OFF
INTO
THE
AETHER
IS
PLAUSIBLE
THIRD
IS
NOT
UNLIKELY
BUT
PHRASES
LIKE
COULD
RUN
AWAY
WITH
THE
DIVISION
ARE
LIKELY
TO
GET
YOU
A
VISIT
FROM
THE
MEN
IN
THE
WHITE
COATS
ITS
NOT
REALLY
CLEAR
THAT
THEIR
STAFF
IS
BETTER
THAN
LAST
YEAR
IF
RUSSELL
DOES
WELL
DARWIN
DOESNT
GO
ON
THE
DL
AND
HESKETH
DOESNT
PITCH
JUST
BARELY
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
AVOID
LOSING
HIS
SPOT
IN
THE
ROTATION
THEY
COULD
BE
BETTER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
HESKETH
PITCHES
MISERABLY
AND
THEYRE
TOO
STUPID
TO
MOVE
HIM
TO
THE
PEN
AND
BRING
UP
CONROY
OR
SOMEBODY
FOSSAS
CONTINUES
TO
PITCH
DISMALLY
BUT
THEY
KEEP
GIVING
HIM
INNINGS
BECASUE
HES
A
LEFTY
AND
RUSSELL
EXPLODES
THEY
COULD
BE
PRETTY
BAD
