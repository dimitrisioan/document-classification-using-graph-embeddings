WRITES
ALRIGHT
THATS
ENOUGH
IVE
SUFFERED
WITH
ALL
KINDS
OF
INSULTS
AS
TYPICAL
FOR
THE
NET
BUT
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
GALARRAGA
IS
CURRENTLY
BATTING
OVER
AND
YOU
GUYS
ARE
COMPLAINING
THAT
HE
ISNT
DRAWING
ENOUGH
WALKS
WHAT
WOULD
HE
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
PLEASE
YOU
GUYS
BAT
YOU
CAN
HARDLY
CLAIM
THAT
HE
IS
HURTING
HIS
TEAM
FINE
ARE
YOU
WILLING
TO
BET
THAT
HE
WILL
BAT
THE
REST
OF
THE
WAY
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
HE
HAS
HURT
THE
ROCKIES
SO
FAR
ITS
THAT
HE
WILL
HURT
THEM
EVENTUALLY
JUST
AS
MUCH
AS
HE
HURT
THE
EXPOS
AND
THE
CARDINALS
THE
PAST
COUPLE
SEASONS
IF
IT
HAPPENS
THAT
THE
PITCHERS
START
THROWING
HIM
FEWER
GOOD
PITCHES
AND
HE
STARTS
MAKING
LOTS
OF
OUTS
AS
SOMEONE
SPECULATED
MIGHT
HAPPEN
THEN
I
WOULD
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
HE
ISNT
TAKING
ENOUGH
PITCHES
MY
COMMENT
IT
HAS
HAPPENED
FOR
THE
PAST
SEASONS
WHERE
HAVE
YOU
BEEN
THAT
HE
ISNT
PAID
TO
WALK
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
A
LICENSE
TO
SWING
AT
BAD
PITCHES
AND
MAKE
OUTS
ITS
MORE
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
HES
BATTING
AND
LEADING
THE
LEAGUE
IN
RBIS
SO
WHAT
BLOODY
DIFFERENCE
DOES
IT
MAKE
IF
HE
ISNT
DRAWING
A
LOT
OF
WALKS
SHEESH
WELL
SEE
COME
SEPTEMBER
I
HAVE
AN
OUTSTANDING
BET
WITH
SOMEONE
THAT
GALARRAGAS
OBP
WILL
BE
LESS
THAN
ON
