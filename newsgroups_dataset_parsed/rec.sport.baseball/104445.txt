oh
lighten
up
what
depresses
me
is
that
they
might
actually
finish
last
which
i
believe
hasnt
happened
since
their
second
season
in
nope
the
royals
are
the
only
team
in
the
majors
that
have
not
finished
in
last
place
of
course
this
doesnt
include
the
marlins
and
the
rockies
but
they
have
a
good
chance
at
finishing
last
also
