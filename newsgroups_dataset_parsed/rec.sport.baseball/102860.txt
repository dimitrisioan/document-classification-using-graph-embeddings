MARLIN
FANS
FROM
IAN
M
DERBY
I
WAS
WATCHING
THE
DODGERSMARLINS
GAME
YESTERDAY
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
THINGS
IMPRESSED
ME
FIRST
IS
THAT
THE
WAY
THE
SUN
WAS
SHINING
IN
MIAMI
IT
HAD
A
SUMMER
ATMOSPHERE
IN
EARLY
SPRING
FOR
BASEBALL
IN
COMPARISON
WRIGLEY
FIELD
IN
EARLY
APRIL
STILL
HAS
A
WINTRY
LOOK
TO
IT
WITH
THE
DEAD
IVY
AND
BUNDLED
UP
FANS
THE
SECOND
AND
MOST
IMPORTANT
WAS
THE
FANS
I
LIKE
THESE
GUYSGALS
I
WILL
ADMIT
I
AM
A
FOOTBALL
FAN
FIRST
BUT
I
STILL
ENJOY
BASEBALL
IT
WAS
INTERESTING
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
THESE
FANS
ARE
ONLY
ACCUSTOMED
TO
THE
MIAMI
DOLPHINS
THE
WAY
THEY
WERE
CHEERING
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
THE
AFC
PLAYOFFS
OF
COURSE
OPENING
DAY
MAY
HAVE
A
LOT
TO
DO
WITH
IT
BUT
I
REALLY
GOT
FEELING
OF
ELECTRICITY
THAT
I
THINK
IS
LACKING
WITH
A
LOT
OF
BASEBALL
FANS
IN
OTHER
CITIES
BASEBALL
CERTAINLY
NEEDS
A
CHARGE
AND
I
HOPE
THESE
TWO
EXPANSION
TEAMS
BRING
BACK
SOME
EXCITEMENT
WELL
FIND
OUT
FRIDAY
HOW
DENVER
BRONCO
FANS
RESPOND
PHILLIES
ARE
I
BETTER
SAY
IT
NOW
BEFORE
MY
OPPORTUNITY
PASSES
BY
