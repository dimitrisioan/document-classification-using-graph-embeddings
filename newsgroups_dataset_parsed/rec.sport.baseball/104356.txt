HONESTLY
OZZIE

AND
ROBIN
YOUNT
DONT
BELONG
THERE

BOTH
SHORTSTOPS

LONG
TIME
BIG
DEAL

YOU
FOR
REAL
HOW
MANY
GOLD
GLOVES
DOES
OZZIE
SMITH
HAVE
IF
A
GUY
HUNG
AROUND
AND
HIT
HOMERS
A
YEAR
FOR
YEARS
WOULDNT
HE
BE
A
GIVEN
FOR
THE
HALL
IS
DEFENSE
NOT
JUST
AS
IMPORTANT
AND
IF
ROBIN
YOUNT
COULDNT

WOULD
HE
HAVE
STUCK
AROUND
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
GET
HITS

LITTLE
MORE
SELECTIVE
HUH

HONORS
SO
LIBERALLY
SAVE
THEM
FOR
THE
GUYS
WHO
REALLY
DESERVE
IT
FACE
IT
IF
SOMETHING
ISNT
DONE
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
PRESTIGE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
ANYMORE
WHEN
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE
THAT
STEVE
GARVEY

JACK
MORRIS
ARE
POTENTIAL
CANDIDATES
THE
ABSURDITY
IS
APPARENT
GEE
CAN
THESE

EVEN
COMPARE

I
AGREE
GARVEY

MORRIS
DONT
DESERVE
IT
THE
MORE
LIKELY
FUTURE
HALL
OF
FAMERS
LIKE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
OR
NOLAN
RYAN
WELL
BASED
ON
YOUR
ARGUMENT
NOLAN
RYAN
DOESNT
DESERVE
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
HE
IS
JUST
A
RIGHT
HANDER
WHO
STUCK
AROUND
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AND
COULD
THROW
HARD
VERY
FEW
GAME
WINNING
SEASONS
LOTS
OF
LOSING
SEASONS
LOTS
OF
WALKS
NO
CY
YOUNG
AWARDS
HOW
DOES
NOLAN
RYAN
COMPARE
TO
A
GUY
LIKE
STEVE
CARLTON
WHO
DOMINATED
OR
MAJOR
LEAGUE
SEASONS
WON
DIVISONS
WORLD
SERIES
AND
WON
HALF
OF
HIS
TEAMS
GAMES
IN
HE
DOESNT
COMPARE
NOT
EVEN
CLOSE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
HASNT
DONE
IT
LONG
ENOUGH
FOR
ME
GIVE
ME
MORE
SEASONS
LIKE
HES
BEEN
HAVING
THEN
ILL
THINK
ABOUT
IT
