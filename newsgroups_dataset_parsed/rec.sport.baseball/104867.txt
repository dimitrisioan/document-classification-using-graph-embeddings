HEY
VALENTINE
I
DONT
SEE
BOSTON
WITH
ANY
WORLD
SERIES
RINGS
ON
THEIR
FINGERS
DAMN
MORRIS
NOW
HAS
THREE
AND
PROBABLY
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
IN
HIS
FUTURE
THEREFORE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
TORONTO
EASILY
MADE
THE
BEST
SIGNING
AND
DONT
TELL
ME
BOSTON
WILL
WIN
THIS
YEAR
THEY
WONT
EVEN
BE
IN
THE
TOP
IN
THE
DIVISION
MORE
LIKE
IN
SPITE
OF
WHAT
ALL
THE
STAT
HEADS
SAY
JACK
MORRIS
PLAYED
A
LARGE
ROLE
IN
THE
JAYS
WINNING
THE
WORLD
SERIES
LAST
YEAR
I
DONT
CARE
IF
HIS
ERA
WAS
HE
PLAYED
A
LEADERSHIP
ROLE
AND
DID
WIN
GAMES
HIS
ERA
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
HIGH
BUT
HE
DID
PITCH
MANY
OUTSTANDING
BALL
GAMES
AND
HE
PITCHED
MANY
NOTSOOUTSTANDING
BALLGAMES
TOO
JACK
ESSENTIALLY
PITCHED
A
LOT
OF
BALL
LAST
YEAR
THIS
CERTAINLY
ISNT
IRRELEVANT
AND
IIF
YOU
REPLACE
MORRIS
WITH
REPLACEMENT
LEVEL
QUALITY
THE
BLUE
JAYS
MIGHT
NOT
WIN
RE
LEADERSHIP
I
DONT
SEE
IT
IF
THE
LEADERSHIP
EFFECT
IS
THERE
FOR
A
STARTING
PITCHER
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
TO
SEE
ITS
PRIMARY
EFFECT
ON
THE
PITCHING
STAFF
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
TO
SEE
THE
REST
OF
THE
STAFF
IMPROVE
INSTEAD
THE
REST
OF
THE
STAFF
DECLINED
YOU
CAN
MAKE
A
REASONABLE
ARGUMENT
FOR
WINFIELD
PROVIDING
LEADERSHIP
THE
OFFENSE
PICKED
UP
CONSIDERABLY
FROM
ITS
EFFECTIVENESS
THE
PREVIOUS
YEAR
IM
NOT
SAYING
I
BUY
THAT
BUT
AT
LEAST
THAT
ARGUMENT
MAKES
INTERNAL
SENSE
