start
jack
morris
has
had
uh
jack
lost
his
edge
about
years
ago
and
has
had
only
one
above
average
year
in
the
last
again
goes
to
prove
that
it
is
better
to
be
good
than
lucky
you
can
count
on
good
tomorrow
lucky
seems
to
be
prone
to
bad
starts
and
a
bad
finish
last
year
yes
i
am
enjoying
every
last
run
he
gives
up
who
was
it
who
said
morris
was
a
better
signing
than
viola
cheers
valentine
hey
valentine
i
dont
see
boston
with
any
world
series
rings
on
their
fingers
damn
morris
now
has
three
and
probably
the
hall
of
fame
in
his
future
therefore
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easily
made
the
best
signing
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
this
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the
division
more
like
shawn
