us
from
simmons

so
far
simmons
looks
like
a
total
idiot
leyland
should
accept
a
part
of
the
blame
for
the
lavalliere
situation
i
cant
understand
his
and
managements
fear
of
losing
tom
prince
through
waivers
even
if
they
do
whats
the
use
he
is
aright
hander
like
slaught
not
a
very
smart
platoon
also
i
am
blaming
leyland
in
this
case
since
he
is
hcurrently
convinced
that
lavalliere
is
through
while
giving
him
way
too
much
time
last
year
in
the
regular
season
and
the
playoffsslaught
should
have
played
in
all
games
he
has
a
good
average
against
right
handed
pitching
didnt
leyland
and
simmons
forsee
this
last
year
and
attempt
to
trade
lavalliere
last
year
itself
any
fool
could
tell
them
lavalliere
wasnt
very
fit
last
year
sorry
but
this
is
the
biggest
load
of
bunk
ive
seen
in
a
while
a
the
pirates
have
been
trying
to
trade
lavalliere
for
some
time
now
nobody
was
even
vaguely
interested
b
several
other
teams
had
made
it
known
that
they
would
grab
prince
who
was
out
of
options
c
lavallieres
release
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
being
through
he
was
released
because
in
the
event
of
an
injury
to
slaught
lavalliere
is
no
longer
capable
they
believe
of
being
the
everyday
catcher
since
slaught
is
as
good
against
righties
as
he
is
against
lefties
the
offense
should
actually
improve
with
this
move
toby
