alomar
vs
baerga
i
was
hoping
to
stay
out
of
this
lyford
frosty
beverage
writes
uh
yes
baerga
has
a
lot
of
flash
but
alomar
was
the
better
hitter
last
year

this
is
fascinating
you
say
that
alomar
was
the
better
hitter
last
year
and
immediately
follow
that
up
with
numbers
showing
that
baerga
had
a
better
year
the
only
category
that
i
see
which
shows
an
advantage
for
alomar
is
obp
well
obp
is
the
most
important
offensive
statistic
and
by
a
big
margin
points
of
obp
is
worth
considerably
more
than
points
of
slugging
that
being
said
i
still
think
baerga
was
very
slightly
better
last
year
but
i
think
this
is
as
close
to
a
wash
as
youre
likely
to
find
i
personally
dont
care
much
for
alomars
defense
i
dont
think
hes
nearly
as
good
as
people
make
him
out
to
be
and
he
cant
turn
the
dp
to
save
his
life
he
comes
across
the
bag
improperly
and
his
release
is
slow
considering
the
high
leverage
of
the
dp
this
is
a
shortcoming
i
cant
overlook
in
the
long
term
id
move
alomar
to
another
position
if
the
jays
could
trade
a
hot
devon
white
for
something
ill
be
alomar
could
be
a
hell
of
a
cf
in
the
long
run
i
think
id
rather
have
jeff
kent
at
and
alomar
in
cf
than
