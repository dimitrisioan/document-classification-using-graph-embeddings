well
most
of
it
are
intentional
walks
are
you
sure
about
this
id
say
pitching
around
him
is
more
likely
yeah
maybe
that
is
more
likely
but
from
the
marinerstigers
series
it
seems
like
every
time
there
are
base
runners
the
pitchers
seem
to
purposely
pitch
around
him
or
give
him
a
free
pass
the
funny
thing
was
that
griffey
was
struggling
up
until
the
last
game
of
the
four
game
series
if
i
remember
correctly
