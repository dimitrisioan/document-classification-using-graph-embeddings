some
pleasant
and
then
some
not
so
pleasant
surprises
about
the
edition
of
the
bronx
bombers
so
far
first
the
pleasant
owen
all
through
spring
training
this
guy
was
looking
like
the
second
coming
of
mike
gallego
but
with
even
worse
hitting
now
the
guy
is
third
in
the
major
leagues
in
ba
and
hes
ranked
pretty
high
in
total
hits
and
runs
scored
i
know
its
still
early
in
the
season
but
he
and
pat
kelly
more
on
him
in
a
minute
have
provided
a
lot
of
spark
at
the
bottom
of
the
order
thats
given
the
big
guys
mattingly
tartabull
oneill
plenty
of
rbi
opportunities
lets
hope
he
keeps
this
up
kelly
the
guy
is
finally
showing
some
of
the
ability
that
led
stick
michael
to
label
him
a
star
for
the
i
wouldnt
go
that
far
but
kelly
looks
infinitely
improved
at
bat
i
guess
the
tips
he
took
from
boggs
in
spring
training
really
paid
off
huh
and
here
i
thought
boggs
would
never
do
anything
to
help
anybody
besides
himself
and
his
glove
like
always
has
been
terrific
he
and
mattingly
comprise
the
best
defensive
right
side
of
the
infield
in
all
of
baseball
imho
oneill
we
had
to
get
rid
of
roberto
kelly
partly
because
he
was
under
too
much
pressure
in
ny
to
be
the
next
barry
bonds
he
wont
do
that
in
cincy
either
and
partly
because
he
had
this
real
unprofessional
tendency
to
give
up
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
i
just
felt
that
we
couldve
gotten
more
for
him
than
oneill
well
so
far
oneill
is
turning
out
just
fine
he
looks
like
he
should
be
able
to
duplicate
if
not
surpass
mel
halls
numbers
from
last
year
and
he
keeps
opposing
pitchers
from
pitching
around
tartabull
now
if
only
buck
would
play
him
against
lefties
some
more
to
see
what
he
can
do
a
friend
made
a
comparison
between
wickman
and
jack
morris
they
never
have
impressive
stats
but
they
always
find
some
way
to
win
although
morris
seems
to
be
losing
that
ability
i
figured
that
wickman
would
be
the
least
important
part
of
the
steve
sax
trade
best
trade
since
we
got
that
ruth
guy
maybe
winding
up
as
a
good
middle
reliever
but
i
like
what
ive
seen
so
far
he
doesnt
pitch
pretty
but
he
gets
the
job
done
whats
going
on
here
key
was
just
supposed
to
provide
the
rotation
with
some
stability
you
know
shore
up
the
left
side
provide
experience
get
maybe
wins
and
here
this
guy
is
dominating
everybody
he
faces
who
needs
maddux
or
cone
ill
take
key
any
day
and
now
the
not
so
pleasant
surprises
owen
sure
hes
hitting
like
crazy
but
the
guy
cannot
field
to
save
his
life
and
they
said
he
was
brought
in
to
provide
defense
velarde
stankiewicz
and
even
silvestri
are
better
defensively
than
owen
remember
its
still
early
look
for
his
offense
to
tail
off
and
his
defense
to
improve
hopefully
he
has
that
rep
because
i
heard
that
either
last
year
or
over
the
last
years
or
something
like
that
he
has
the
third
highest
fielding
percentage
among
major
league
shortstops
behind
cr
and
tony
im
not
gonna
help
this
sorry
mets
team
at
all
fernandez
i
do
agree
though
that
he
has
not
looked
all
that
impressive
in
the
field
thus
far
the
book
on
tartabull
was
keep
him
healthy
and
hell
produce
well
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
sure
hes
hit
a
few
homers
but
those
were
all
solo
shots
and
he
hasnt
gotten
any
of
the
big
rbis
that
your
cleanup
man
is
supposed
to
give
you
then
again
he
had
a
slow
start
last
year
once
he
got
off
the
dl
that
is
and
turned
into
a
oneman
wrecking
crew
late
in
the
year
so
well
see
bullpen
ughwhat
happened
we
were
supposed
to
have
one
of
the
most
solid
pens
in
the
majors
meanwhile
the
pen
has
already
blown
three
saves
maybe
more
i
havent
checked
the
great
howefarr
leftyrighty
tandem
farrs
era
is
in
the
or
and
howes
isinfinite
i
didnt
think
such
a
thing
was
possible
but
it
is
hopefully
theyll
get
their
acts
together
or
else
bucks
gonna
burn
out
the
starters
for
fear
that
the
bullpenll
blow
a
lead
in
the
immortal
words
of
the
scooter
holy
cow
seaver
that
johnny
key
guy
can
pitch
cant
he
see
you
in
the
series
