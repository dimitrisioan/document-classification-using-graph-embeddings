WRITES
THE
REASON
I
BOTHERED
DOING
THIS
DR
STUFF
WAS
TO
SEE
IF
I
COULD
DETERMINE
THE
ANSWER
TO
THE
AGEOLD
QUESTION
IS
JEFF
BLAUSER
MORE
VALUABLE
THAN
RAFAEL
BELLIARD
WELL
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
JUST
AS
DOUG
TRUMPED
TIM
BEATING
HIM
TO
THE
NET
WITH
HIS
DEFENSIVE
ANALYSES
SO
TIM
HAS
GOTTEN
IN
AHEAD
OF
ME
THE
WAY
I
WAS
DOING
IT
WAS
A
LITTLE
DIFFERENT
BEING
ME
OF
COURSE
I
USED
EQUIVALENT
AVERAGES
TO
WORK
OUT
HOW
MANY
RUNS
A
PLAYER
WAS
WORTH
AND
I
CALCULATED
BOTH
RATE
OF
PERFORMANCE
FIELDING
EQUIVALENT
AVERAGE
AND
TOTAL
PERFORMANCE
FIELDING
EQUIVALENT
RUNS
BUT
I
COMPARED
NOT
TO
THE
AVERAGE
PLAYER
BUT
THE
REPLACEMENT
PLAYER
AND
HERES
WHY
BECAUSE
THE
POSITIONAL
ADJUSTMENT
COMES
BUILT
IN
TO
THE
SYSTEM
IN
THE
AL
OF
THE

SS
IS

WE
MAY
QUIBBLE
WITH
THE
EXACT
NUMBERS
BUT
THE
ORDER
LOOKS
SUBSTANTIALLY
RIGHT
IN
THE
EQUIVALENT
AVERAGE
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
SET
LEAGUE
AVERAGE
TO
I
HAD
DECIDED
IN
HITTING
THAT
THE
REPLACEMENT
LEVEL
BATTER
HAS
AN
EQA
OF
THE
NAME
OF
THAT
REPLACEMENT
LEVEL
HITTER
OFTEN
AS
NOT
IS
BILLY
RIPKEN
I
DECIDED
TO
LET
THE
REPLACEMENT
LEVEL
FIELDER
BE
THE
SAME
DISTANCE
FROM
AS
BUT
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
AS
I
HAVE
SET
IT
UP
THAT
MAKES
FOR
AN
EQA
OF
YES
I
CAN
ADD
RUNS

PROPORTIONAL
TO

SQUARED
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
SQUARED
AND
SQUARED
EQUALS
THE
DIFFERENCE
TO
SQUARED
AND
I
ROUNDED

SIMPLICITY
AN

UGH
SO
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
RAR
FOR
A
PLAYER
IS
THE
SUM
OF
HIS
BATTING
AND
FIELDING

I
CAN
RATE
THEM
