i
think
that
everything
else
being
equal
its
not
too
much
to
ask
that
if
a
weeknight
game
can
be
shortened
by
halfanhour
by
cutting
out
warmup
pitches
dawdling
outside
the
batters
box
commercial
timeouts
and
that
sort
of
thing
im
not
asking
for
too
much
how
do
you
know
they
can
be
shortened
by
halfanhour
has
anybody
done
a
study
to
determine
how
much
time
is
actually
wasted
say
in
these
as
games
oh
probably
ms
nichols
has
given
the
average
game
times
and
average
runs
scored
for
and
a
very
nice
piece
of
information
ms
nichols
who
knows
she
may
be
listening
and
not
have
me
in
her
kill
file
after
all
those
numbers
indicate
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
halfarun
less
being
scored
per
game
and
the
games
taking
minutes
longer
something
is
being
done
now
that
wasnt
done
ten
years
ago
which
is
extending
the
games
by
minutes
ms
nichols
thinks
its
more
pitches
given
the
increasing
specialization
of
pitchers
it
wouldnt
surprise
me
if
its
not
simply
more
pitches
though
i
dont
think
its
unreasonable
to
think
that
something
can
be
done
to
get
ten
of
those
minutes
back
then
i
get
a
couple
more
from
shortening
the
warmup
time
for
a
relief
pitcher
after
he
comes
in
and
a
couple
more
still
from
enforcing
existing
rules
which
have
been
stated
in
other
posts
in
this
thread
and
other
related
ones
the
problem
is
who
decides
whether
that
time
is
wasted
you
dont
seem
to
think
it
is
at
all
right
now
i
think
it
is
although
i
have
heard
one
case
favoring
giving
the
reliever
all
the
warmups
he
thinks
he
needs
the
difference
in
mounds
between
the
field
and
pen
but
who
knows
if
the
rules
get
changed
maybe
something
i
didnt
foresee
will
happen
to
change
my
mind
but
you
can
bet
a
lot
of
minds
would
fail
to
foresee
the
same
thing
or
else
nothing
will
be
changed
rg
i
can
play
me
better
than
anyone
theres
only
one
of
me
barry
bonds
on
playing
himself
in
two
movies
