a
longer
game
in
no
way
suggests
more
baseball
to
watch
unless
you
include
watching
the
grass
grow
as
baseball
i
definitely
do
thats
why
i
dont
like
going
to
see
games
played
on
artificial
turf
the
lengthier
games
are
so
because
of
batters
stepping
out
of
the
box
pitchers
taking
longer
between
pitches
and
excessive
trips
to
the
mound
by
managers
and
pitching
coaches
and
while
its
true
that
the
gaps
between
plays
can
be
interesting
this
is
only
true
when
they
dont
become
extralong
well
your
idea
of
interesting
differs
from
mine
i
think
batting
practice
is
interesting
for
example
and
make
a
special
effort
to
get
to
the
game
very
early
in
order
to
see
it
i
think
the
delaying
tactics
of
batters
pitchers
catchers
and
managers
are
interesting
because
theyre
attempts
to
gain
advantage
through
control
of
the
flow
and
timing
of
the
game
of
course
the
umpires
can
and
should
intervene
when
these
tactics
get
out
of
hand
as
ryan
robbins
has
pointed
out
there
are
rules
that
cover
this
one
of
the
more
fascinating
things
about
baseball
i
think
is
its
openendedness
with
regard
to
time
you
never
know
if
the
game
is
going
to
zip
right
by
and
be
over
in
less
than
two
hours
or
if
its
going
to
go
on
until
four
in
the
morning
likewise
some
games
are
actionpacked
and
some
games
are
slow
and
lazy
thats
fine
by
me
those
folks
who
want
constant
action
should
watch
the
games
on
tv
so
they
can
channel
surf
and
cater
to
their
short
attention
