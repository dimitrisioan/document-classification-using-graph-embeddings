DAVID
MADDEN
WRITES
ANOTHER
PAIR
OF
SUGGESTIONS
REMOVE
THE
BALK
RULE
IT
IS
THE
RUNNERS
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
STAY
SAFE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
PITCHER
DOES
IF
A
PITCHER
THROWS
TO
AN
OCCUPIED
BASE
MORE
THAN
X
TIME
X
TO
WITHOUT
SUCCESSFULLY
PICKING
OFF
THE
RUNNER
THE
RUNNER
ADVANCES
A
BASE
AS
IF
WALKED
THIS
LAST
SUGGESTION
WILL
PROBABLY
INCREASE
THE
NUMBER
OF
STOLEN
BASES
CONSIDERABLY
SUPPOSE
THE
PITCHER
USES
UP
OF
HIS
N
PICKOFF
ATTEMPTS
THE
RUNNER
CAN
PROBABLY
STRETCH
HIS
LEAD
OFF
THE
BASE
GIVEN
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
EXTRA
PRESSURE
ON
THE
PITCHER
TO
GET
IT
RIGHT
THIS
TIME
WOULD
THIS
SUGGESTION
APPLY
TO
PICKOFF
ATTEMPTS
PER
PITCH
PER
BATTER
OR
PER
BASE
RUNNER
ON
THE
SAME
BASE
