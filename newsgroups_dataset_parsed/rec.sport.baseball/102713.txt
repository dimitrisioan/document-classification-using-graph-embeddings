RE
YOUNG
CATCHERS
MOST
OF
THIS
DISCUSSION
HAS
BEEN
BETWEEN
MARK
SINGER
AND
DAVID
TATE
WITH
VALENTINE
WEIGHING
IN
ON
THE
SAME
SIDE
AS
DAVE
AT
VARIOUS
TIMES
MY
OPINION
FWIW
TO
ALL
MARK
AGE
DOESNT
MATTER
ABILITY
DOES
I
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
THE
UNTRIED
ROOKIE
WITH
GREAT
MINOR
LEAGUE
NUMBERS
THAN
THE
VETERAN
WHO
HAS
PROVEN
HIMSELF
TO
BE
AVERAGE
AT
BEST
I
DONT
CARE
IF
HE
IS
IF
HE
PLAYS
BETTER
THAN
WHAT
I
HAVE
I
WANT
HIM
OUT
THERE
SANDY
ALOMAR
HAD
DECENT
MINOR
LEAGUE
NUMBERS
GROSSLY
INFLATED
BY
THE
PCL
IN
GENERAL
AND
LAS
VEGAS
IN
PARTICULAR
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PROJECTED
AS
AN
AVERAGE
MAJOR
LEAGUE
HITTER
WHICH
IS
GOOD
FOR
A
CATCHER
ILL
ADMIT
SANTIAGOS
NUMBERS
WOULD
PROBABLY
COME
OUT
THE
SAME
AS
SANDYS
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
LEAGUE
DATA
FROM
THE
TO
CHECK
IT
OUT
THAT
BEING
SAID
I
AGREE
WITH
SENDING
LOPEZ
TO
RICHMOND
AT
LEAST
TO
START
THE
SEASON
AS
THE
BOX
BELOW
SHOWS
HE
HAS
ONE
MINOR
LEAGUE
SEASON
IN
WHICH
HE
HIT
WELL
HE
HAS
TWO
IN
WHICH
HE
HIT
VERY
VERY
POORLY
I
WANT
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
LOPEZ
IS
REAL
OLSON
AND
BERRYHILL
ARE
NOT
COMPLETE
MEDIOCRITIES
FOR
CATCHERS
ESPECIALLY
NL
CATCHERS
THEY
ARE
ESSENTIALLY
AVERAGE
HITTERS
WITH
EQUIVALENT
AVERAGES
AROUND
IF
HE
HAD
HIT
WELL
AT
PRIOR
LEVELS
I
WOULD
SAY
HE
BELONGS
ON
THE
BRAVES
BUT
THERE
IS
A
REASONABLE
CHANCE
THAT
LOPEZ
LAST
YEAR
WAS
JUST
AS
MUCH
A
FLUKE
AS
ALOMAR
IN
OR
SANTIAGO
IN
ONE
YEAR
AT
ANY
LEVEL
AT
ANY
AGE
DOESNT
SATISFY

HIS
BEHAVIOR

LAST

WAS

BUSH
LAST
YEAR
WAS
THE
FIRST
TIME
HE
EVER
GOT
AB
IN

SO
HIS
LINES
ARE
HARD
TO

HE
HAS
A
COMBINED
OPS
IN

PLAY
WITH
HIS

IS
MORE
VALUABLE
THAN
THE
OPS

INDICATES

AT

HE
HAS
