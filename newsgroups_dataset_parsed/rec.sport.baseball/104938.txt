MAJOR
LEAGUE
BASEBALL
IS
TRYING
TO
EXPAND
ITS
APPEAL
TO
PEOPLE
WITH
SHORTER
ATTENTION
SPANS
IE
THE
FOOTBALL
CROWD
INVARIABLY
ALL
THE
ARGUMENTS
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
LIKE
TO
WATCH
BASEBALL
ON
TV
SAY
THE
SAME
THING
THE
GAMES
ARE
TOO
LONG
AND
TOO
BORING
BASEBALL
IS
TRYING
TO
FIND
A
WAY
TO
SHORTEN
THE
GAMES
FOR
WIDER
TV
APPEAL
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
IT
THOUGH
BASEBALL
GAMES
LAST
AROUND
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
AS
FOOTBALL
GAMES
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
MORE
ACTION
IN
THAT
DURATION
IN
FOOTBALL
GAMES
PERHAPS
IF
THERE
WERE
MORE
ACTION
IN
BASEBALL
GAMES
YOU
WOULD
GET
MORE
OF
THOSE
FANS
TO
TUNE
IN
ANYWAY
COMING
UP
WITH
A
SOLUTION
TO
MAKE
BASEBALL
MORE
APPEALING
TO
A
BIGGER
CROWD
IS
GOING
TO
BE
DIFFICULT
ON
SOAPBOX
YET
ANOTHER
REASON
TO
GET
A
COMMISIONER
NOW
SINCE
ITS
OBVIOUS
THAT
RULING
BASEBALL
BY
COMITTEE
WORKS
ABOUT
AS
FAST
AS
A
SNAIL
RACE
IN
NEBRASKA
OFF
SOAPBOX
HOW
CAN
YOU
SAY
THERE
IS
MORE
ACTION
IN
FOOTBALL
THEN
BASEBALL
A
FOOTBALL
GAME
CONSISTS
OF
APPROXIMATELY
PLAYS
AND
THE
AVERAGE
DURATION
OF
A
PLAY
IS
AROUND
SECONDS
THIS
MEANS
THAT
IN
A
GAME
THAT
LASTS
APPROXIMATELY
HOURS
YOU
HAVE
ABOUT
MINUTE
S
OF
ACTION
IN
A
BASEBALL
GAME
YOU
HAVE
UPWARDS
OF
TWO
HUNDRED
PITCHES
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
ON
FIELD
STRATEGY
ON
FIELD
STRATGY
SESSIONS
IE
HUDDLES
AND
YOU
ALWAYS
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
WIN
UNTIL
THE
LAST
OUT
IS
MADE
AH
BUT
THE
ILLUSION
IN
FOOTBALL
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
LOTS
OF
ACTION
AND
A
SENSE
OF
URGENCY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
GAME
CLOCK
NOT
ALL
THE
TIME
BUT
IT
HAPPENS
WHEN
THERES
LESS
THAN
MINUTES
TO
GO
QUITE
OFTEN
THIS
SENSE
CREATES
DRAMA
EVEN
WHEN
THERE
MAY
NOT
NECESSARILY
BE
ANY
AND
THAT
HOLDS
A
VIEWERS
ATTENTION
IN
BASEBALL
ONLY
PLAYERS
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
ACTION
FOR
ABOUT
HERE
COMES
A
WILD
GUESS
OF
THE
TIME
AND
THEYRE

WHAT

AND
THE

ARE
TRYING
