RE
DAVE
KINGMAN
FOR
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
IN
ARTICLE
STEVE
TOMASSI
WRITES
HI
BASEBALL
FANS
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
SAY
DONT
YOU
THINK
HE
DESERVES
IT
I
MEAN
HECK
IF
DAVE
WINFIELD
HOHUM
IS
SERIOUSLY
BEING
CONSIDERED
FOR
IT
AS
IS
LEE
SMITH
HA
THEN
WHY
DONT
WE
GIVE
DAVE
KINGMAN
A
CHANCE
OR
DARRELL
EVANS
YEAH
YEAH
AFTER
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
TAKES
IN
THEM
IT
CAN
TAKE
IN
EDDIE
MURRAY
AND
JEFF
REARDON
I
AM
TRYING
TO
THINK
HOW
TO
RESPOND
TO
THIS
WITHOUT
INVOLVING
PERSONAL
FEELING
OR
PERCEPTIONS
AND
I
CAN
NOT
WITHOUT
HAVING
STATS
TO
BACK
UP
MY
POINTS
HOWEVER
I
THINK
YOU
APPROACHED
THIS
THE
WRONG
WAY
I
BELIEVE
ALL
OF
THE
PEOPLE
MENTIONED
HERE
DESERVE
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
MORE
THAN
DAVE
KINGMAN
DOES
I
FEEL
THEY
WERE
ALL
MUCH
BETTER
PLAYERS
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
I
FELL
THEY
DESERVE
TO
GO
BUT
THAT
THEY
WOULD
DESERVE
IT
MORE
IMHO
DAVE
KINGMAN
DEFINATELY
NOT
THEY
GUY
ONLY
HAD
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
WERE
HE
COULD
HIT
WITH
ATLEAST
A
RESPECTABLE
AVERAG
THE
REST
OF
HIS
CAREER
I
DO
NOT
THINK
HE
WAS
VERY
FEARED
BY
PITCHERS
I
ALSO
DO
NOT
THINK
HE
DID
A
LOT
FOR
THE
GAME
I
MEAN
REALLY
I
AM
A
MET
FAN
HE
WAS
A
MET
FOR
PART
OF
HIS
CAREER
AND
I
STILL
WOULD
NOT
BACK
HIM
FOR
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
DAVE
WINFIELD
I
THINK
SO
HE
IS
FEARED
BY
PITCHERS
HE
HAS
HAD
SEVERAL
SEASON
WHERE
HE
HIT
FOR
A
RESPECTABLE
AVERAGE
AND
HIS
PRODUCTION
NUMBERS
ARE
IN
MY
OPINION
WITHOUT
STATS
BETTER
THAN
KINGMANS
PROBABLY
BY
QUITE
A
BIT
I
ALSO
PERCEIVE
HIM
TO
BE
A
LEADER
MAYBE
NOT
AS
MUCH
AS
SOME
OTHER
PEOPLE
BUT
NONE
THE
LESS
A
LEADER
I
THINK
HE
HAS
MADE
SUBSTANTIAL
CONTRIBUTIONS
TO
THE
GAME
OF
BASEBALL
AND
TO
SOCIETY
EXAMPLES
OF
THIS
ARE
SOME
OF
THE
CHARITABLE
THINGS
HE
HAS
DONE
I
KNOW
SOME
OF
THIS
FROM
WHEN
HE
WAS
WITH
THE
YANKEES
I
THINK
HE
THE
TYPE
OF
PLAYER
THAT
KIDS
CAN
LOOK
UP
TO
AND
WHILE
THIS
IS
DEFINATELY
NOT
THE
ONLY
CRITERIA
FOR
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
I
THINK
IT
DESERVES
SOME
CONSIDERATION
LEE
SMITH
MAYBE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SEE
HIS
STATS
AGAIN
BUT
HE
DEFINATELY
WOULD
DESERVE
TO
GO
BEFORE
THE
LIKES
OF
KINGMAN
DARRELL
EVANS
NO
EDDIE
MURRAY
MAYBE
HE
HAS
HAD
A
VERY
GOOD
CAREER
HE
IS
A
LEADER
ALTHOUGH
A
SILENT
ONE
HE
IS
A
GOOD
ROLE
MODEL
ARE
THE
STATS
GOOD
ENOUGH
I
AM
NOT
SURE
BUT
I
WOULD
ONCE
AGAIN
BELIEVE
THEY
ARE
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
KINGMANS
BOTH
THE
AVERAGE
AS
WELL
AS
THE
POWER
NUMBERS
BUT
NOT
AS
GOOD
AS
WINFIELDS
JUST
THINK
EDDIE
DID
NOT
HAVE
AS
MUCH
PUBLICITY
FOR
MOST
OF
HIS
GREAT
YEARS
JEFF
REARDON
MY
GUESS
IS
NO
BUT
IT
KIND
OF
DEPENDS
ON
HIS
NUMBERS
OFF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
I
WOULD
TAKE
LEE
SMITH
FIRST
WELL
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
SICK
AND
TIRED
MOSTLY
SICK
OF
EVERYBODY
GIVING
HALL
OF
FAME
CONSIDERATION
TO
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
BY
TODAYS
STANDARDS
MARGINAL
HONESTLY
OZZIE
SMITH
AND
ROBIN
YOUNT
DONT
BELONG
THERE
THEYRE
BOTH
SHORTSTOPS
THAT
JUST
HUNG
AROUND
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BIG
DEAL
WELL
I
STRONGLY
DISAGREE
HERE
BOTH
OF
THESE
GUYS
DESERVE
IT
FOR
SURE
I
TALKED
ABOUT
LEADERSHIP
ABOVE
BOTH
OF
THESE
GUYS
ARE
LEADERS
AND
HAVE
BEEN
INSTUMENTAL
IN
LEADING
THEIR
TEAMS
TO
THE
POST
SEASON
ROBIN
DOES
HAVE
VERY
GOOD
OFFENSIVE
NUMBERS
BOTH
AVERAGE
AND
POWER
AND
OZZIE
HAS
OKAY
NUMBERS
OFFENSIVELY
THE
DIFFERENCE
WITH
OZZIE
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
GAVE
HIM
A
HOME
RUN
FOR
EVERY
RUN
HE
SAVED
BY
MAKING
AN
INCREDIBLE
PLAY
AT
SHORTSTOP
HE
WOULD
HAVE
SHATTERED
AARONS
HOME
RUN
MARK
BY
NOW
HOW
MANY
OF
THOSE
GREAT
PLAYS
SAVED
GAMES
HOW
MANY
OF
THOSE
GREAT
PLAYS
MOTIVATED
HIS
TEAM
TO
RALLY
AND
WIN
A
GAME
WHILE
I
BELIEVE
BOTH
OF
THESE
GUYS
HAVE
NUMBERS
BASEBALL
IS
ABOUT
MORE
THAN
NUMBERS
OR
AT
LEAST
WINNING
AT
BASEBALL
IS
ABOUT
MORE
THAN
NUMBERS
BOTH
OF
THESE
GUYS
ARE
PROVEN
STARS
AND
BELONG
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
AS
DOES
GEORGE
BRETT
WHO
ALSO
BELONGS
IN
THIS
CLASS
OF
PLAYER
LETS
BE
A
LITTLE
MORE
SELECTIVE
HUH
STOP
HANDING
OUT
THESE
HONORS
SO
LIBERALLY
SAVE
THEM
FOR
THE
GUYS
WHO
REALLY
DESERVE
IT
FACE
IT
IF
SOMETHING
ISNT
DONE
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
PRESTIGE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
ANYMORE
WHEN
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE
THAT
STEVE
GARVEY
OR
JACK
MORRIS
ARE
POTENTIAL
CANDIDATES
THE
ABSURDITY
IS
APPARENT
GEE
CAN
THESE
GUYS
EVEN
COMPARE
TO
THE
MORE
LIKELY
FUTURE
HALL
OF
FAMERS
LIKE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
OR
NOLAN
RYAN
STEVE
GARVEY
I
AM
NOT
SURE
PROBABLY
NOT
BUT
I
GUESS
I
COULD
SEE
SOMEONE
MAKING
A
CASE
FOR
HIM
JACK
MORRIS
ONCE
AGAIN
NOT
MY
FIRST
CHOICE
BUT
I
CAN
SEE
WHY
SOMEONE
MIGHT
BRING
UP
HIS
NAME
KIRBY
PUCKETT
PROBABLY
THE
ONLY
REASON
I
DO
NOT
SAY
DEFINATELY
IS
HE
STILL
HAS
TIME
LEFT
IN
HIS
CAREER
IF
HE
CONTINUES
DOING
WHAT
HE
HAS
BEEN
THEN
MY
PROBABLY
WILL
TURN
INTO
A
DEFINATELY
NOLAN
RYAN
IS
THERE
REALLY
ANY
DOUBT
I
THINK
I
HEARD
SOMETHING
ABOUT
HIM
HAVING
SOME
RECORDS
MAYBE
THEY
WERE
NOT
ALL
GOOD
I
DONT
KNOW
I
DID
NOT
HEAR
ANY
OF
THEM
JUST
THE
NUMBER
HE
HAS
THE
NUMBERS
HE
HAS
THE
CONTRIBUTIONS
TO
THE
GAME
AND
COMMUNITY
AND
HE
IS
A
GREAT
ROLE
MODEL
I
WOULD
NOT
SAY
THAT
HE
IS
THE
BEST
PITCHER
TO
EVER
PITCH
THE
GAME
PROBABLY
NOT
EVEN
TOP
BUT
HE
WOULD
BE
THE
FIRST
PITCHER
I
WOULD
PUT
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
NOHITTERS
STRIKEOUTS
RESPECTABLE
NUMBERS
EVEN
WITH
SOME
WEAKER
TEAMS
YOU
CAN
GO
ON
AND
ON
I
REALLY
HOPE
HE
GETS
ALL
THE
POSSIBLE
VOTES
SO
IN
SUMMING
UP
I
HAVE
GROUPS
THOSE
THAT
BELONG
THOSE
THAT
PROBABLY
DO
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
AND
THOSE
THAT
I
LEAN
TOWARDS
SAYING
DONT
BELONG
AT
LEAST
NOT
WITHOUT
MY
SEEING
STATS
AND
POSSIBLY
HEARING
REASONS
WHY
THEY
SHOULD
GO
YES
WINFIELD
YOUNT
BRETTNOT
IN
YOUR
MAIL
O
SMITH
PUCKETT
AND
RYAN
MAYBE
MURRAY
AND
L
SMITH
NO
REARDON
GARVEY
MORRIS
EVANS
AND
DEFINATELY
KINGMAN
AS
I
SAID
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
STATS
AROUND
SO
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
NUMBERS
TO
BACK
THIS
UP
THESE
ARE
ENTIRELY
MY
OPINIONS
BASED
ON
MY
PERCEPTIONS
