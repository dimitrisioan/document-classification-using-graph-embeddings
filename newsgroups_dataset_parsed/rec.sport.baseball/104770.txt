RELATIVE
VALUE
OF

KIMEMONGOOSETOROLABIBMCOM
EDWARD
KIM
WRITES
IT
IS
DOUBTFUL
THAT
THE
BLUE
JAYS
WOULD
HAVE
WON
THE
AL
EAST
WITHOUT
MORRIS
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
THE
TEAM
WENT
FOR
THE
MONTH
OF
AUGUST
AND
ALL
THE
OTHER
STARTERS
WERE
BEING
SHELLED
AND
MILWAUKEE
WAS
MAKING
A
CHARGE
MORRIS
WENT
WITH
A
PRETTY
GOOD
ERA
I
CANT
REMEMBER
EXACTLY
ALSO
LETS
NOT
UNDERESTIMATE
THE
IMPORTANCE
HIS
INNINGS
TO
SAVE
THE
BULLPEN
EVERY
FIFTH
DAY
IF
HE
DIDNT
HELP
US
WIN
THE
AL
EAST
FORGET
ABOUT
THE
PENNENT
AND
THE
WORLD
SERIES
HIS
RUN
SUPPORT
WAS
HIGH
RUNS
BUT
SO
WAS
STOTTLEMYERS
RUNS
AND
HE
WON
ONLY
GAMES
I
DO
REMEMBER
MORRIS
WINNING
AN
INORDINATE
NUMBER
OF
AND
BALLGAMES
BUT
THIS
IS
TO
HIS
CREDIT
HE
PITCHED
ONLY
AS
GOOD
AS
HE
NEEDED
TO
BE
WHEN
HE
WAS
UP
IN
A
BALLGAME
HE
JUST
PUT
IT
IN
CRUISE
CONTROL
AND
THREW
THE
BALL
UP
THERE
AND
LET
THE
BATTERS
GET
THEMSELEVES
OUT
I
HATE
THIS
EXPRESSION
AN
INEXPERIENCED
PITCHER
WOULD
WEAR
HIMSELF
OUT
TRYING
TO
MAKE
PERFECT
PITCHES
TO
KEEP
HIS
ERA
DOWN
BUT
MORRIS
BEING
A
VETERAN
PITCHER
KNOWS
THAT
WINNING
IS
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
REALLY
MATTERS
IN
BASEBALL
BY
SAVING
HIMSELF
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
REACH
BACK
FOR
THAT
LITTLE
EXTRA
I
HATE
THIS
TOO
WHEN
THE
GAME
WAS
ON
THE
LINE
I
DONT
BUY
THIS
AT
ALL
I
THINK
THINGS
ARE
COLORED
TO
A
VERY
LARGE
DEGREE
OF
PRECONCEIVED
NOTIONS
OF
WHO
THE
PLAYERS
INVOLVED
ARE
TRY
THIS
EXERCISE
XXX
IS
PITCHING
TODAY
HIS
TEAM
SCORES
IN
THE
FIRST
INNING
AND
IN
THE
FOURTH
XXX
GIVES
UP
IN
THE
THROUGH
IN
THE
FIFTH
HE
GIVES
UP
RUNS
IN
THE
HE
GIVES
UP
MORE
THE
SCORE
IS
NOW
WITH
XXXS
TEAM
STILL
ON
TOP
I
CONTEND
THAT
IF
XXX
WERE
JACK
MORRIS
THE
ASSESSMENT
WOULD
BE
HE
IS
A
GUTTY
VETERAN
WHO
PITCHES
ONLY
AS
WELL
AS
HE
HAS
TO
TO
WIN
IF
XXX
WERE
MIKE
TRMBLEY
THE
ASSESSMENT
WOULD
BE
HE
IS
AN
INEXPERIENCED
ROOKIE
WHO
DOESNT
KNOW
HOW
TO
PITCH
NEEDS
MORE
SEASONING
SEND
HIM
TO
AAA

TO
