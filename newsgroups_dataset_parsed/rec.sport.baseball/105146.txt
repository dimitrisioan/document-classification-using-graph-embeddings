i
feel
that
talking
about
speeding
up
baseball
games
is
like
trying
to
keep
signal
to
noise
ratio
high
on
recsportsbaseball
no
matter
how
much
you
talk
about
it
or
how
reasonable
your
arguments
there
will
always
be
people
who
quote
an
entire
article
with
signatures
to
make
a
one
line
comment
reply
or
woof
whether
through
their
stupidity
denseness
or
excitement
and
overeagerness
to
bless
us
with
their
insight
no
matter
what
is
said
they
will
always
keep
doing
it
same
with
ballgames
no
matter
how
much
it
might
benefit
the
game
for
the
umpires
to
enforce
the
rules
and
for
the
playersmanagerscoaches
to
stop
wasting
our
time
it
just
aint
gonna
happen
rudy
i
agree
