MEA
CULPA
BOSIO
NONO
LIKE
CLINTON
AND
RENO
I
ACCEPT
FULL
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THIS
SENSELESS
DISASTER
MY
WIFE
AND
I
PICKED
THIS
GAME
TO
GO
TO
AND
THUS
CAUSED
THE
RETURN
OF
THE
PRESEASONPROJECTED
SOX
OFFENSE
LIKE
ALL
NONOS
BOSIO
WAS
GOOD
LUCKY
HARD
GROUNDER
BY
VAUGHN
OFF
T
MARTINEZ
GLOVE
BUT
STRAIGHT
TO
BOONE
WHO
THREW
TO
BOSIO
AT
FIRST
AND
BACKED
BY
GOOD
DEFENSE
MANY
NONTRIVIAL
GROUNDOUTS
THE
GAME
WAS
AMAZINGLY
FAST
AS
THE
SOX
TENDED
TO
GO
DOWN
QUICKLY
AND
HESKETH
WAS
ALSO
WORKING
FAST
THE
SOX
RELIEF
PITCHING
WAS
OK
THE
RUNS
OFF
QUANTRILL
WERE
ON
TWO
RIDICULOUS
BLOOPS
AND
A
HARD
LINE
SINGLE
WHICH
GREENWELL
LET
GET
PAST
HIM
TRYING
FOR
A
CATCH
GREENWELLS
MENTAL
STABILITY
IS
A
SERIOUS
CONCERN
I
GUESS
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
BUT
HIS
QUIRKS
WERE
AMUSING
BACK
WHEN
HE
WAS
AN
MVP
CANDIDATE
WEDNESDAY
HE
GOT
IN
A
HUFF
WITH
JOHNSON
A
AFTER
STRIKING
OUT
ON
A
BAD
INSIDE
PITCH
APPARENTLY
JOHNSON
MADE
AN
OK
IVE
GOT
TO
STAY
FOCUSED
GESTURE
WHICH
IRON
MIKE
INTERPRETED
AS
TAUNTING
AND
STRUCK
OUT
TO
HEAVY
BOOING
THE
NEXT
TWO
TIMES
AS
VALENTINE
NOTED
LAST
NIGHT
HE
CAME
UP
IN
THE
FIRST
AFTER
RILES
AND
QUINTANA
HAD
WALKED
TO
OPEN
THE
GAME
CAN
YOU
SAY
TAKE
THE
FIRST
PITCH
NOT
MIKE
WHO
DRIBBLED
IT
INTO
A
THE
PI
QUOTED
BOSIO
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
BATTING
PRACTICE
FASTBALL
NEXT
TIME
UP
HE
ALSO
HIT
THE
FIRST
PITCH
A
HARD
LINER
STRAIGHT
TO
KGJR
IN
CENTER
HE
ALSO
MADE
THE
PATHETIC
ERROR
AND
FAILED
TO
CATCH
BOONES
HR
WHICH
LOOKED
COMPARABLE
TO
THE
BALL
LANCE
JOHNSON
CAUGHT
ON
THE
HIGHLIGHT
REEL
THAT
NIGHT
IS
RILES
SUPPSOED
TO
BE
GOOD
DEFENSIVELY
I
COULDNT
TELL
FROM
THE
FIELD
ANGLE
BUT
HIS
RANGE
LOOKED
BAD
AND
HE
COUGHED
A
DP
THAT
COST
A
RUN
OR
TWO
WHY
WAS
HE
LEADOFF
I
HOPE
FLETCHER
GETS
WELL
SOON
ALSO
ON
LINEUPS
PINELLA
PUT
BRET
BOONE
FIFTH
FOR
REASONS
BEYOND
ME
IT
SEEMED
TO
WORK
AS
HE
WAS
WITH
A
HR
AND
SOME
GOOD
DEFENSE
A
WAG
BEHIND
US
SAID
HE
SURE
DONT
WANT
TO
GO
BACK
TO
CALGARY
THERE
IS
A
THEORY
THAT
YOU
PUT
A
LEADOFF
TYPE
FIFTH
BECAUSE
THEYLL
LIKELY
LEAD
OFF
THE
SECOND
AS
BOONE
DID
WELL
NOW
WE
FACE
THE
HOT
ANGELS
AND
ANOTHER
POWER
PITCHER
IN
LANGSTON
A
REMINDER
THAT
CONTEST
ENTRIES
ARE
OPEN
THROUGH
NEXT
WEDNESDAY
I
EXPECT
A
SURGE
OF
PESSIMISM
BY
THE
WAY
TIES
WILL
BE
BROKEN
BY
EARLIEST
ENTRY
ONE
ENTRY
PER
PERSON
OR
PSEUDONYM
PLEASE
