HOWEVER
WHAT
IS
WITH
THIS
POLICY
OF
TRYING
TO
SPEED
UP
THE
GAMES
YOU
ARE
THE
FIRST
PERSON
NONMEDIOT
I
HAVE
SEEN
ENDORSE
THIS
POLICY
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
LENGTH
OF
GAMES
AT
ALL
AND
AM
TIRED
OF
THE
ESPN
CROWD
AND
OTHER
ANNOUNCERS
BITCHING
ABOUT
IT
I
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
IN
A
BALLPARK
FILLED
WITH
PEOPLE
LOOKING
AT
THEIR
WATCHES
AND
SHOUTING
HURRY
UP
IF
I
COUGH
UP
BIG
BUCKS
FOR
A
TICKET
I
DONT
MIND
A
GAME
THAT
LAST
MORE

REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND

AGREE
WITH

WHATS
THE
BIG
DEAL
ABOUT
LONG
GAMES
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
WATCH
BASEBALL
THERES
THAT
MUCH
MORE
BASEBALL
TO
WATCH
AND
YES
BASEBALL
INCLUDES
THE
SPACE
BETWEEN
PLAYS
AS
WELL
AS
THE
PLAYS
THEMSELVES
FIRST
A
LONGER
GAME
IN
NO
WAY
SUGGESTS
MORE
BASEBALL
TO
WATCH
UNLESS
YOU
INCLUDE
WATCHING
THE
GRASS
GROW
AS
BASEBALL
THE
LENGTHIER
GAMES
ARE
SO
BECAUSE
OF
BATTERS
STEPPING
OUT
OF
THE
BOX
PITCHERS
TAKING
LONGER
BETWEEN
PITCHES
AND
EXCESSIVE
TRIPS
TO
THE
MOUND
BY
MANAGERS
AND
PITCHING
COACHES
AND
WHILE
ITS
TRUE
THAT
THE
GAPS
BETWEEN
PLAYS
CAN
BE
INTERESTING
THIS
IS
ONLY
TRUE
WHEN
