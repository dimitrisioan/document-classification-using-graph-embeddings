i
seem
to
have
misplaced
the
baseball
bibliography
that
was
posted
here
recently
thats
what
happens
when
you
have
to
split
a
heap
of
disorganized
files
from
one
machine
among
two
others
could
some
kind
soul
repost
the
bibliography
or
mail
me
a
copy
also
in
particular
a
colleague
of
mine
is
looking
for
any
information
he
can
find
on
moe
berg

of
any
references
or
anecdotes
for
that
matter
would
be
appreciated

i
believe
si
had
an
indepth
article
on
moe
a
while
ago
i
remember
that
the
article
revealed
some
new
facts
regarding
the
secretive
moe
my
si
subscription
expired
this
past
february
the
second
of
two
years
that
i
received
same
therefore
my
guess
is
that
the
article
appeared
sometime
in
can
anyone
else
be
more
definitive
as
to
a
date
of
the
si
article
