PHILS
SPOT
ON
ESPN

FEW
WEEKS
AGO
I
POSTED
ABOUT
THE
PHILLIES
TEAM
PERSONALITIES
DID
ANYONE
SEE
THE
ESPN
FEATURE
ON
THE
PHILS
ON
MONDAY
NIGHT
JOHN
KRUK
HAD
A
GREAT
LINE
HE
WAS
TALKING
ABOUT
PEOPLE
ON
THE
TEAM
ALWAYS
PLAYING
AND
NOT
SITTING
OUT
BECAUSE
OF
A
MINOR
INJURY
HE
SAID
IF
THEY
DO
THEY
KNOW
WELL
KICK
THEIR
ASS
THE
TIME
I
SAW
IN
WAS
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
AND
IT
WAS
NOT
BLEEPED
WHEN
I
SAW
IT
AT
THEY
BLEEPED
ASS
MITCH
WILLIAMS
TALKED
ABOUT
THE
TEAM
BEING
A
BUNCH
OF
THROWAWAYS
FROM
OTHER
TEAMS
AND
THAT
IS
WHY
THEY
ARE
SO
CLOSE
KRUK
SAID
THAT
THEY
ALL
GET
ALONG
THIS
YEAR
LAST
YEAR
HE
SAID
THEY
HATED
THE
PITCHERS
I
ASSUME
HE
WAS
JOKING
BUT
HE
ALWAYS
KEEPS
A
STRAIGHT
FACE
WHEN
HE
TALKS
OH
WHAT
A
TEAM
ROB

TO
DAY

DREAM
ABOUT
TOMORROW
