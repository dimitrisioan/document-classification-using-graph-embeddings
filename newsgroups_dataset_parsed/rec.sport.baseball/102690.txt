that
teal
bleah
indeed
if
the
color
teal
on
a
teams
uniforms
is
any
indication
of
the
future
the
marlins
are
in
dire
trouble
refer
to
the
san
jose
sharks
for
proof
but
i
have
hope
for
the
marlins
i
was
a
sometime
member
of
the
rene
lachemann
fan
club
at
the
oakland
coliseum
and
have
a
deep
respect
for
the
guy
hes
a
gem
and
of
course
walt
weiss
gives
that
franchise
class
but
yeah
whoever
designed
those
uniforms
was
guilty
of
a
paucity
of
style
and
imagination
