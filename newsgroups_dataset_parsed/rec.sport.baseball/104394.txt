GO
YELL
TAUNTS

SHERRI
NICHOLS
SNICHOLSADOBECOM
WELL
SHERRI
ID
AGREE
WITH
YOU
EXCEPT
THAT
MOST
KIDDIES
HAVE
MORE
SENSE
THAN
TO
SPEW
THEIR
OBSCENITIES
IN
FRONT
OF
A
GROUP
OF
ADULTS
I
TRY
TO
EDIT
THIS
NEWSGROUP
AND
FEED
IT
TO
ONE
OF
THE
LOCAL
ELEMENTARY
SCHOOLS
THEY
HAVE
A
GROUP
OF
STUDENTS
THAT
JUST
LOVE
BASEBALL
AND
ARE
LEARNING
TO
USE
COMPUTERS
BUT
IM
TELLING
YOU
ITS
GOTTEN
TO
THE
POINT
THAT
I
DONT
EVEN
EDIT
THE
FILES
ANYMORE
JUST
READ
THEM
AND
THROW
OUT
THE
TRASH
AND
THANKS
TO
ALL
YOU
PEOPLE
THAT
THINK
ITS
WONDERFUL
TO
INCLUDE
A
SWEAR
WORD
OR
TWO
IN
YOUR
SIGNATURE
FILES
THATS
REALLY
NICE
I
HAVE
TO
READ
THE
WHOLE
ARTICLE
AND
THEN
TOSS
IT
OUT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SIG
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
KNOW
ALL
THE
WORDS
YOU
DO
AND
IVE
EVEN
MADE
UP
SOME
OF
MY
OWN
OR
I
WOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
EDIT
THEM
OUT
BUT
THIS
JUST
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
THE
PLACE
A
PUBLIC
FORUM
TO
SPEW
FOUL
LANGUAGE
SORRY
THANKS
TO
ALL
YOU
PEOPLE
THAT
KEEP
IN
MIND
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
DECENT
YOUNG
PEOPLE
INTERESTED
IN
BASEBALL
AND
COMPUTERS
READING
THIS
NEWSGROUP
THEY
ENJOY
YOUR
ARTICLES
