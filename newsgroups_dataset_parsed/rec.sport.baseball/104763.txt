ERIC
ROUSH
WRITES
WHEN
GANT
TURNED
AWAY
HIRSCHBECK
IMMEDIATELY
MOTIONED
FOR
GANT
TO
STEP
INTO
THE
BOX
IMO
AT
THIS
POINT
IN
TIME
HIRSCHBECK
WAS
DETERMINED
TO
SHOW
GANT
EXACTLY
WHO
WAS
IN
CHARGE
OF
THIS
GAME
GANT
WASNT
DAWDLING
HE
HADNT
HAD
A
CHANCE
TO
DAWDLE
AND
HIRSCHBECK
WAS
SIMPLY
EXERCISING
A
POWER
PLAY
GANT
RESISTED
AS
MANY
OF
US
MIGHT
TO
WHAT
WE
THOUGHT
WAS
AN
UNREASONABLE
REQUEST
AND
HIRSCHBECK
CALLED
FOR
THE
PITCH
AT
THAT
POINT
COX
CAME
OUT
ON
THE
FIELD
THE
PITCH
WAS
THROWN
AND
MANY
OTHER
BRAVES
LEFT
THE
DUGOUT
COX
WAS
TOSSED
PROTECTING
HIS
PLAYER
I
WAS
PLEASANTLY
SURPRISED
THAT
GANT
KEPT
HIS
COOL
ENOUGH
TO
STAY
IN
THE
GAME
DID
YOU
SEE
THE
SAME
GAME
I
SAW
GANT
MOST
REASONABLE
ARGUED
A
HORRIBLE
CALL
WHICH
HIRSCHBECK
CORRECTLY
DID
NOTHING
ABOUT
GANT
THEN
PROCEEDED
TO
WALK
HALFWAY
TO
BASE
LEAN
ON
HIS
BAT
AND
GLARE
AT
HIRSCHBECK
WHILE
I
DONT
NECESSASARILY
SUBSCRIBE
TO
THE
THEORY
OF
SHOWING
PEOPLE
UP
THIS
WAS
AN
OBVIOUS
ATTEMPT
BY
GANT
TO
DO
SO
TO
HIRSCHBECK
HE
LEFT
HIRSCHBECK
NO
CHOICE
BUT
TO
TAKE
CONTROL
OF
THE
SITUATION
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
GANT
STARTED
A
DANGEROUS
POWER
STRUGGLE
WITH
HIRSCHBECK
WHEN
HIS
TEAM
NEEDED
HIM
MOST
AND
HE
LOST
THE
EVENTS
I
SAW
WERE
CALLED
STRIKE
BY
HIRSCHBECK
SHOCKEDLOOKING
GANT
ASKS
FOR
APPEAL
TO
FIRST
NO
APPEAL
TO
FIRST
GANT
STEPS
OUT
OF
BATTERS
BOX
HIRSCHBECK
IMMEDIATELY
ORDERS
GANT
BACK
IN
BAD
MOVE
GANT
IGNORES
HIRSCHBECK
AND
WALKS
OFF
BAD
MOVE
HIRSCHBECK
YELLS
AT
GANT
GANT
IS
SILENT
HIRSCHBECK
CALLS
FOR
THE
PITCH
PITCH
IS
CALLED
A
STRIKE
COX
ARGUES
COULDNT
SEE
WHEN
HE
CAME
ON
THE
FIELD
COX
IS
EJECTED
PLAYERS
EVERYWHERE
PLAY
FINALLY
RESUMES
GANT
SHOULDNT
HAVE
IGNORED
HIRSCHBECK
NOT
RETURNING
MADE
THE
STRIKE
CALL
FAIRLY
LIKELY
ALTHOUGH
I
SUSPECT
AN
ARGUMENT
MIGHT
HAVE
GOTTEN
GANT
TOSSED
ALTOGETHER
BUT
IF
HIRSCHBECK
HAD
LET
GANT
STEP
OUT
THE
WHOLE
INCIDENT
PROBABLY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
AVOIDED
