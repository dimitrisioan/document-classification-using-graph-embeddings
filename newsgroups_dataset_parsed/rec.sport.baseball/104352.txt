HECK
IF
DAVE
WINFIELD
HOHUM
IS
SERIOUSLY
BEING
CONSIDERED
FOR
IT
AS

LEE
SMITH

WE
GIVE
DAVE
KINGMAN
A
CHANCE
OR
DARRELL
EVANS

AFTER
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
TAKES
IN
THEM
IT
CAN
TAKE
IN
EDDIE
MURRAY

REARDON
WELL
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
SICK
AND
TIRED
MOSTLY
SICK
OF
EVERYBODY
GIVING
HALL
OF
FAME
CONSIDERATION
TO
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
BY
TODAYS
STANDARDS
MARGINAL
HONESTLY
OZZIE
SMITH

SHORTSTOPS

BE
A
LITTLE
MORE
SELECTIVE
HUH
STOP
HANDING
OUT
THESE
HONORS
SO
LIBERALLY
SAVE
THEM
FOR
THE
GUYS
WHO
REALLY
DESERVE
IT
FACE
IT
IF
SOMETHING
ISNT
DONE
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
PRESTIGE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
ANYMORE
WHEN
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE
THAT
STEVE
GARVEY
OR
JACK
MORRIS
ARE
POTENTIAL
CANDIDATES
THE
ABSURDITY
IS
APPARENT
GEE
CAN
THESE

EVEN
COMPARE
TO
THE
MORE
LIKELY
FUTURE
HALL
OF
FAMERS
LIKE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
OR
NOLAN
RYAN
Ñ
STEVE
