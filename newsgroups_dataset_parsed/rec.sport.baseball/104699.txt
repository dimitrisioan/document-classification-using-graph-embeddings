moe
berg
npr
this
morning
had
an
interview
with
linda
mccarthy
name
possibly
garbled
by
me
an
official
historian
for
the
cia
she
has
won
an
emmy
for
research
on
moe
berg
for
a
tv
documentary
which
i
know
from
nothing
but
which
sounds
good
she
said
that
among
other
things
berg
was
the
principal
spy
for
the
oss
cias
wwii
precursor
spying
on
axis
atomic
programs
because
of
his
physics
background
and
language
skills
she
said
that
during
the
war
he
met
with
heisenberg
in
switzerland
and
had
instructions
to
shoot
heisenberg
if
the
germans
were
close
to
us
in
bomb
research
he
concluded
they
were
two
years
behind
and
didnt
shoot
him
i
have
heard
elsewhere
that
heisenberg
deliberately
misled
the
nazi
bomb
program
but
i
dont
know
how
reliable
this
is
unfortunately
npr
didnt
mention
any
kind
of
a
book
shes
writing
id
certainly
buy
it
in
case
youre
wondering
about
baseball
relevance
berg
was
a
longtime
mlb
backup
catcher
he
was
a
member
of
an
mlb
allstar
team
that
toured
japan
in
presumably
not
because
of
his
baseball
prowess
but
because
he
was
one
of
the
few
americans
much
less
mlb
players
who
spoke
japanese
photos
he
took
of
tokyo
on
that
trip
were
later
used
to
plan
bombing
raids
according
to
mccarthy
