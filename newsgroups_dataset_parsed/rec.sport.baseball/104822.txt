KINGOZCAMELOTBRADLEYEDU
ORIN
ROTH
WRITES
WELL
OFFICIALLY
ITS
THE
BRAVES
AT
LEAST
UP
UNTIL
THEY
STARTED
WINNING
IT
WAS
ARE
THEY
STILL
OFFICIALLY
IF
SO
WHY
AND
HOW
DID
THEY
RECEIVE
THIS
LABEL
UNOFFICALLY
BUT
WITHOUT
A
DOUBT
AMERICAS
TEAM
IS
THE
CUBS
WHY
WELL
MY
GUESS
IS
BECAUSE
AMERICA
LOVES
UNDERDOGS
EVERY
YEAR
NO
MATTER
THE
CUBS
TALENT
OR
THE
PREDICTIONS
THEY
NEVER
AS
CLOSE
TO
NEVER
AS
POSSIBLE
WIN
ANYTHING
OVER
THE
YEARS
AS
THE
LOSING
HAS
MOUNTED
AMERICA
HAS
FALLEN
IN
LOVE
WITH
THESE
PERENNIAL
LOSERS
THE
CUBS
HAVE
MORE
FANS
IN
CHICAGO
THEN
SOME
TEAMS
DO
WORLDWIDE
THE
CUBS
HAVE
MORE
FANS
WORLDWIDE
THAN
MOST
OF
THE
TEAMS
IN
THEIR
DIVISION
COMBINED
AN
AURA
OF
EXCITEMENT
SURROUNDS
THE
CUBS
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
SEASON
LIKE
NO
ONE
ELSE
INCLUDING
THE
WS
CHAMPS
IT
MUST
BE
THAT
ETERNAL
HOPE
THIS
IS
THE
YEAR
THEYVE
GOT
THE
TALENT
THEYRE
OFF
TO
A
GOOD
START
THEYVE
GOT
THE
PITCHING
OR
HITTING
OR
WHATEVER
THEIR
STRONG
POINT
IS
AT
THE
TIME
ITS
THAT
INEVITABILITY
THAT
THE
CUBS
WILL
EVENTUALLY
WIN
THE
WS
AGAIN
WHEN
ONLY
GOD
KNOWS
SINCE
ITS
BEEN
SO
LONG
IT
COULD
COME
AT
ANY
TIME
OR
IT
COULD
BE
ANOTHER
YEARS
BUT
UNTIL
THEY
DO
FINALLY
WIN
AND
START
WINNING
CONSISTENTLY
THE
CUBS
WILL
REMAIN
AMERICAS
LOVABLE
UNDERDOGS

ORIN
BRADLEY
U
IM
REALLY
A
JESTER
IN
DISGUISE
YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT
BRAVES
FANS
ARE
NOTHING
BUT
A
BUNCH
OF
BANDWAGONERS
CORRECT
ME
IF
I
AM
WRONG
BUT
OR
YEARS
AGO
YOU
COULDNT
GIVE
AWAY
A
TICKET
TO
SEE
THE
BRAVES
PLAYI
WOULD
BET
MY
NEXT
PAYCHECK
THAT
OF
THE
SOCALLED
BRAVES
FANS
LIVING
OUTSIDE
OF
GEORGIA
AT
THE
PRESENT
TIME
CAN
NOT
NAME
MORE
THAN
PLAYERS
FROM
THEIR
SEASON
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ASK
ANY
CUBS
FAN
LIVING
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
TO
NAME
PLAYERS
FROM
ANY
GIVEN
YEAR
AND
OF
THEM
PROBABLY
COULD
GRANTED
THE
FACT
THAT
A
TEAM
WINS
BRINGS
PEOPLE
TO
THE
BALL
PARK
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THEY
DISERVE
THE
TITLE
AMERICAS
TEAM
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEY
ARE
CONSIDERED
AMERICAS
TEAM
IS
BECAUSE
OF
TED
TURNER
AND
HIS
LITTLE
TV
STATION
WHICH
BROADCASTS
ACROSS
THE
NATION
ILL
CONSIDER
TORONTO
AMERICAS
TEAM
BEFORE
THE

ALL
I
WANT
IN
LIFE
IS
A
WOMAN
TO
LOVE
AND
A
WOMAN
TO
CARE
FOR
MY
KIDS
HOPEFULLY
THE
TWO
WILL
NEVER
MEET
