CRAIG
EID
WRITES
THESE
THINGS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
BUT
IT
TOOK
A
REAL
BUSINESSMAN
EX
SAFEWAY
PRESIDENT
PETER
MAGOWAN
TO
FIGURE
IT
OUT
JUST
LIKE
HE
USED
TO
TELL
HIS
CHECKERS
IF
THE
CUSTOMERS
DONT
COME
BACK
I
DONT
NEED
AS
MANY
CHECKERS
THIS
ISNT
A
KNOCK
ON
BOB
LURIE
HE
WAS
A
COMPETENT
BUSINESSMAN
BUT
HE
DIDNT
DEAL
MUCH

ITS
AMAZING
HOW
HARD
IT
IS
TO
GET
BASEBALL
TEAMS
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
TO
PROPERLY
MARKET
THEIR
TEAMS
AND
TREAT
THEIR
CUSTOMERS
NO
OTHER
BUSINESS
COULD
EVER
GET
AWAY
WITH
THE
CENTURY
ATTITUDES
THAT
MOST
CURRENT
OWNERS
DISPLAY
IN
RUNNING
THEIR
CLUBS
I
GUESS
THE
OWNERS
LOOK
AT
BASEBALLS
HIGH
GROWTH
RATE
AND
ASK
WHY
ITS
NECESSARY
TO
BRING
CENTURY
BUSINESS
PRACTICES
INTO
THE
GAME
BUT
THEY
DONT
REALIZE
HOW
MUCH
MORE
GROWTH
THE
GAME
IS
CAPABLE
OF
AND
HOW
MUCH
THEY
PAY
IN
TERMS
OF
LONGTERM
POPULARITY
BY
NOT
DOING
BETTER
BY
THE
GAME
AND
ITS
