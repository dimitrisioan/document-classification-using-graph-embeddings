has
jack
lost
a
bit
of
his
edge
what
is
the
worst
start
jack
morris
has
had
uh
jack
lost
his
edge
about
years
ago
and
has
had
only
one
above
average
year
in
the
last
again
goes
to
prove
that
it
is
better
to
be
good
than
lucky
you
can
count
on
good
tomorrow
lucky
seems
to
be
prone
to
bad
starts
and
a
bad
finish
last
year
yes
i
am
enjoying
every
last
run
he
gives
up
who
was
it
who
said
morris
was
a
better
signing
than
viola
hey
valentine
i
dont
see
boston
with
any
world
series
rings
on
their
fingers
oooooo
cheap
shot
damn
morris
now
has
three
and
probably
the
hall
of
fame
in
his
future
who
cares
he
had
two
of
them
before
he
came
to
toronto
and
if
the
jays
had
signed
viola
instead
of
morris
it
would
have
been
frank
who
won
and
got
the
ring
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
this
year
too
therefore
i
would
have
to
say
toronto
easily
made
the
best
signing
your
logic
is
curious
and
spurious
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
viola
wouldnt
have
won
as
many
games
had
he
signed
with
toronto
when
you
compare
their
stupid
wl
records
be
sure
to
compare
their
teams
offensive
averages
too
now
looking
at
anything
like
the
morrisviola
sweepstakes
a
year
later
is
basically
hindsight
but
there
were
plenty
of
reasons
why
it
should
have
been
apparent
that
viola
was
the
better
pitcher
based
on
previous
recent
years
and
also
based
on
age
frank
is
almost
years
younger
how
many
knew
that
people
got
caught
up
in
the
world
series
and
then
on
morris
wins
last
year
wins
are
the
stupidest
most
misleading
statistic
in
baseball
far
worse
than
rbi
or
r
that
he
won
just
means
that
the
jays
got
him
a
lot
of
runs
the
only
really
valid
retort
to
valentine
is
werent
the
red
sox
trying
to
get
morris
too
oh
sure
they
said
viola
was
their
first
choice
afterwards
but
what
should
we
have
expected
they
would
say
and
dont
tell
me
boston
will
win
this
year
they
wont
even
be
in
the
top
in
the
division
more
like
if
this
is
true
it
wont
be
for
lack
of
contribution
by
viola
so
who
cares
