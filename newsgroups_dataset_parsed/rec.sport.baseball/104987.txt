RE
REASON
FOR
GIANTS
JUNE
SWOON
GIANTS
OFF
TO
A
FAST
START
IN

KENTON
YEE
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
THE
GIANTS
HAVE
WON
OF
THEIR
LAST
GAMES
BEHIND
SOME
SOLID
PITCHING
EXCLUDING
THAT
WIN
AGAINST
ATLANTA
IF
THEY
CAN
STAY
AROUND
FIRST
PLACE
AFTER
SAY
THE
FIRST
GAMES
I
THINK
THEYVE
GOT
A
LEGITIMATE
CHANCE
AT
WINNING
THE
PENNANT
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
MORE
THAN
THAT
DONT
YOU
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
GIANTS
WERE
IN
PLACE
AS
LATE
AS
JUNE
LAST
YEAR
THEN
THEIR
PITCHING
COLLAPSED
THEIR
PROBLEM
IS
THEY
HAVE
OPTIMISTICALLY
ONLY
GOOD
STARTING
PITCHERS
SWIFTBRANTLYAND
THE
BOWLERCANT
REMEMBER
HIS
NAME
THE
OTHER
STARTERS
ARE
EXTREMELY
UNRELIABLE
AND
OFTEN
GET
BLASTED
BEFORE
INNINGS
THAT
MEANS
THE
ALREADY
SHALLOW
BULLPEN
GETS
OVER
WORKED
THIS
MEANS
AFTER
A
FEW
MONTHS
THE
BULLPEN
COLLAPSES
AND
THEIR
POSTALLSTAR
RECORD
TENDS
TO
BE
MUCH
WORST
THAN
THEIR
PREALLSTAR
RECORD
THE
BOWLER
IS
JOHN
BURKETT
WHO
WENT
TO
LAST
NIGHT
HE
IS
A
BARGAIN
PICKUP
ON
MY
ROTO
TEAM
I
GOT
HIM
AT
A
MINIMUM
OF
JUST
A
THOUGHT
DOES
SOMEONE
HAVE
THE
WONLOST
PREPOST
ALLSTAR
RECORDS
FOR
THE
GIANTS
THE
LAST
FEW
SEASONS
I
BET
THEIR
RECORDS
TENDS
TO
BE
WORST
AND
WORST
AS
THE
SEASON
GOES
ON
THIS
IS
NOT
REALLY
TRUE
EXCLUDING
LAST
SEASON
THE
GIANTS
HAS
BEEN
A
BETTER
HALF
TEAM
IN
THEY
HAD
A
HOT
AUGUST
TO
PULL
TO
WITHIN
A
FEW
GAMES
OF
THE
BRAVES
AND
DODGERS
BEFORE
FADING
IN
SEPTEMBER
THE
GIANTS
MAY
GO
BACK
TO
EARTH
BUT
NOT
AS
FAST
AS
LAST
SEASON
FOR
TWO
REASONS
BARRY
BONDS
ROGER
CRAIG
IS
NO
LONGER
THE
MANAGER
DUSTY
CAN
MANAGE
HIS
PITCHING
STAFFS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
CRAIG
EDWARD
HUI
