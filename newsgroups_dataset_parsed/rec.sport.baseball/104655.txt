FORREST
SMITH
WRITES
ARGUMENT
OVER
REASONABLE
PLAYERS
AND
UMPIRES
DELETED
INCIDENTALLY
A
REASONABLE
HOME
PLATE
UMPIRE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SO
RESISTANT
TO
SEEKING
THE
APPEAL
TO
THE
FIRST
BASE
UMPIRE
AS
GANT
REQUESTED
IF
THE
HOME
PLATE
UMPIRE
HAD
APPEALED
TO
FIRST
THE
FIRST
BASE
UMPIRE
COULD
HAVE
WRUNG
UP
THE
STRIKE
AND
GANT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SO
UPSET
IF
THE
CALL
HAD
BEEN
A
BALL
AND
THE
CATCHER
HAD
REQUESTED
THE
APPEAL
IT
IS
LIKELY
THE
HOME
PLATE
UMPIRE
WOULD
HAVE
ASKED
FOR
THE
HELP
YES
BUT
THE
BASEBALL
RULES
SAY
YOU
CAN
ONLY
APPEAL
A
BALL
AND
NOT
A
STRIKE
THERE
WAS
NO
DECISION
MADE
BY
THE
UMPIRE
REGARDING
AN
APPEAL
ONCE
HE
CALLED
IT
A
STRIKE
THE
CALL
COULD
NOT
BE
CHANGED
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
UMPIRE
DID
THE
RIGHT
THING
