WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
DAVID
MADDEN
WRITES
ANOTHER
PAIR
OF
SUGGESTIONS
REMOVE
THE
BALK
RULE
IT
IS
THE
RUNNERS
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
STAY
SAFE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
PITCHER
DOES
QUITE
HONESTLY
THIS
ONE
IS
RIDICULOUS
CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
SCENARIO
RUNNER
ON
THIRD
AS
THE
PITCHER
STARTS
TO
THROW
HOME
THE
RUNNER
TAKES
OFF
FOR
HOME
AND
THE
BATTER
SQUARES
AROUND
TO
BUNT
FOR
THE
SUICIDE
SQUEEZE
THE
PITCHER
SEEING
THIS
DOES
NOT
THROW
HOME
BUT
STOPS
IN
MID
ACTION
AND
PUTS
THE
RUNNER
IN
A
RUN
DOWN
IT
IS
THE
BALK
RULE
THAT
PREVENTS
THIS
FROM
HAPPENING
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
THIS
ACTUALLY
HAPPENED
TO
ME
ONCE
IN
AN
OBA
ONTARIO
BASEBALL
ASSOCIATION
GAME
IN
MILTON
ONTARIO
I
WAS
THE
BATTER
AND
TO
MY
AMAZEMENT
THE
UMPIRE
MISSED
IT
IN
THE
YEARS
THAT
I
PLAYED
BALL
THIS
WAS
WORST
PIECE
OF
UMPIRING
I
EVER
SAW
