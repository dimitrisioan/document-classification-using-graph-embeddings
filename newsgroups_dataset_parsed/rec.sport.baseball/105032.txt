THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
WANTED
TO
KNOW
HOW
THE
BIG
CAT
LOOKED
I
WAS
ALSO
AT
THE
SATURDAY
GAME
IN
MONTREAL
APR
THAT
ROCKIES
WON
I
HAVENT
PAID
MUCH
ATTENTION
TO
GALLARRAGA
SINCE
HE
LEFT
THE
EXPOS
BUT
HIS
STANCE
SEEMED
TO
BE
MUCH
DIFFERENT
HE
STANDS
MORE
ERECT
AND
VERY
OPEN
WITH
HIS
LEFT
FOOT
POINTING
TO
BASE
IM
WONDERING
IF
THIS
IS
A
RECENT
CHANGE
IN
STANCE
FOR
HIM
ANDRES
HAD
ONE
GLARING
WEAKNESS
AS
A
HITTER
HE
COULD
ALWAYS
BE
FOOLED
BY
A
CURVE
BALL
LOW
AND
AWAY
IF
THIS
IS
INDEED
A
NEW
STANCE
FOR
HIM
MAYBE
HE
IS
NOT
BEING
FOOLED
AS
EASILY
AS
FOR
HIS
PATIENCE
DENNIS
MARTINEZ
DEFINITELY
DID
NOT
HAVE
HIS
GOOD
STUFF
IF
HE
WAS
GROOVING
PITCHES
TO
ANDRES
YOU
CAN
HARDLY
FAULT
HIM
FOR
DRILLING
THEM
WHICH
HE
DID
DOES
ANDRES
GENERALLY
START
HOT
OR
COLD
DOES
IT
TAKE
UNTIL
MAY
FOR
MOST
PITCHERS
TO
HAVE
CONFIDENCE
IN
THAT
CURVE
BALL
LOW
AND
AWAY
