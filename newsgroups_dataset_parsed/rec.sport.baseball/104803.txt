ONE
OF
THE
CHAPTERS
IN
PALMER
AND
THORNS
HIDDEN
GAME
IS
TITLED
PITCHING
IS
OF
BASEBALL
IMPLYING
THAT
FIELDING
IS
HOW
DO
THEY
DETERMINE
THAT
BEATS
ME
ITS
BEEN
A
LONG
LONG
TIME
SINCE
I
READ
IT
THIS
WAS
MY
OPINION
THE
STUPIDEST
THING
IN
THE
HIDDEN
GAME
THE
ARGUMENT
WAS
DEFENSE
OR
RUNS
ALLOWED
IS
OF
THE
GAME
UNEARNED
RUNS
AMOUNT
TO
OF
THE
RUNS
ALLOWED
EARNED
RUNS
SINCE
UNEARNED
RUNS
ARE
THE
RESULT
OF
FIELDING
NOT
PITCHING
AND
EARNED
RUNS
ARE
THE
PRODUCT
OF
PITCHING
NOT
FIELDING
FIELDING
IS
OF
DEFENSE
AND
PITCHING
IS
OF
DEFENSE
CAOMBINING
WITH
PITCHING
IS
OF
THE
GAME
FIELDING
PETE
IS
USUALLY
SHARPER
THAN
THAT
MY
OWN
FEEL
IS
THAT
FIELDING
IS
IN
THE
OF
DEFENSE
RANGE
CALL
IT
BETWEEN
FIELDING
AND
PITCHING
ONE
ALSO
HAS
TO
SEPARATE
OFFENSE
INTO
BATTING
AND
BASERUNNING
WITH
THE
SPLIT
PROBABLY
SOMEWHERE
AROUND
AND
ID
GIVE
BASERUNNING
A
LITTLE
MORE
CREDIT
THAN
THAT
MAYBE
OR
EVEN
GIVE
A
TEAM
OF
ROBERTO
ALOMAR
AND
A
TEAM
OF
JOHN
OLERUDS
IDENTICAL
BATTING
STATS
WHICH
WOULDNT
BE
THAT
UNREASONABLE
AND
EVEN
IF
YOU
DONT
LET
ROBERTO
STEAL
A
SINGLE
BASE
THEYLL
SCORE
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THE
OLERUDS
BY
GOING
FIRSTTOTHIRD
MORE
OFTEN
NO
