BIGCAT
KUBEYSGICOM
KEN
KUBEY
SAID
I
SUPPOSE
A
FOUL
BALL
MACHINE
LIKE
BRETT
BUTLER
IS
PRETTY
VALUABLE
BUT
ID
RATHER
WATCH
AND
ROOT
FOR
THE
LOWER
OBP
GUYS
WHO
CAN
ACTUALLY
HIT
THE
BALL
NOW
THIS
IS
A
LEGITIMATE
POINT
BASEBALL
IS
ENTERTAINMENT
AND
I
HAVE
NO
QUARREL
WITH
PEOPLE
WHO
FIND
CERTAIN
STYLES
OF
PLAY
MORE
ENTERTAINING
THAN
OTHERS
REGARDLESS
OF
THEIR
WINVALUE
PERSONALLY
IM
A
HUGE
FAN
OF
THE
SLUGBUNT
I
DOUBT
ITS
A
HIGHPERCENTAGE
PLAY
BUT
I
GET
A
BIG
KICK
OUT
OF
IT
I
AM
WILLING
TO
LIVE
WITH
THE
BAD
CONSEQUENCES
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
THE
FUN
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
CLAIMING
AS
SOME
DO
THAT
GALARRAGAS
INABILITY
TO
DEFER
GRATIFICATION
ISNT
HURTING
HIS
TEAM
BECAUSE
HE
ISNT
PAID
TO
WALK
OR
IS
AN
RBI
GUY
OR
WHATEVER
AND
FINALLY
ID
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
MANY
HIGH
OBP
GUYS
DRAW
THEIR
WALKS
MORE
BECAUSE
PITCHERS
ARE
AFRAID
TO
THROW
A
STRIKE
TO
THEM
THAN
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
A
GREAT
EYE
IM
NOT
SURE
I
USED
TO
THINK
THIS
WAS
TRUE
BUT
MORE
AND
MORE
IM
BECOMING
CONVINCED
THAT
ITS
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
AMONG
PLAYERS
WITH
THE
PHYSICAL
ABILITY
TO
HIT
THE
BALL
REAL
HARD
THE
PATIENT
ONES
ARE
THE
ONES
WHO
GET
THE
CHANCE
TO
DO
IT
A
LOT
LETS
BREAK
DOWN
THE
FOUR
BASIC
CATEGORIES
OF
HITTER
ACCORDING
TO
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
POWER
THREATS
AND
WHETHER
THEY
WALK

REALLY
LOOKS

THE

ARE
INDEPENDENT
NOBODY
COULD
POSSIBLY
BE
AFRAID
OF
CRAIG
GREBECK
AT
THE
PLATE
AND
YET
HE
WALKS
QUITE
A
LOT
PART
OF
THAT
UNDOUBTEDLY
IS
BEING
SMALL
OF
STATURE
BUT
SURELY
MAJOR
LEAGUE
PITCHERS
CAN
HIT
THAT
SORT
OF
TARGET
AT

TIMES
OUT
OF
RANDY
MILLIGAN
IS
AN
EVEN
BETTER
EXAMPLE
HES
ONLY
SHOWN

OVER
