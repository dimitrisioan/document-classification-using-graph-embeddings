think
that
everything
else
being
equal
its
not
too
much
to
ask
that
if
a
weeknight
game
can
be
shortened
by
halfanhour
by
cutting
out
warmup
pitches
dawdling
outside
the
batters
box
commerical
timeouts
and
that
sort
of
thing
im
not
asking
for
too
much
how
do
you
know
they
can
be
shortened
by
halfanhour
has
anybody
done
a
study
to
determine
how
much
time
is
actually
wasted
say
in
these
as
games
