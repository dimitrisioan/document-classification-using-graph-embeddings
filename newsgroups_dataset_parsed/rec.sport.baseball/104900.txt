RE
INFIELD
FLY
RULE
JROGOFFSCOTTSKIDMOREEDU
JAY
ROGOFF
WRITES
ONE
LAST
INFIELD
FLY
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
ALWAYS
PUZZLED
ME
AND
HASNT
YET
BEEN
ADDRESSED
I
BELIEVE
THE
RULE
ALSO
DOES
NOT
DEAL
WITH
THIS
SITUATION
HOWEVER
IF
THE
INFIELD
FLY
IS
NOT
CAUGHT
AT
WHAT
POINT
CAN
A
RUNNER
LEGALLY
LEAVE
HIS
BASE
WO
FEAR
OF
BEING
DOUBLED
OFF
FOR
ADVANCING
TOO
EARLY
THE
RUNNER
CAN
LEAVE
HIS
BASE
AT
ANY
TIME
IF
THE
BALL
IS
CAUGHT
HES
GOT
TO
TAG
UP
IF
IT
ISNT
CAUGHT
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
TAG
UP
AT
ALL
SO
IF
HES
FEELING
LUCKY
YOUR
RUNNER
AT
SECOND
CAN
SPRINT
FOR
GLORY
AS
SOON
AS
THE
BALL
IS
POPPED
UP
IF
IT
ISNT
CAUGHT
HES
PROBABLY
SCORED
A
RUN
IF
IT
IS
HES
PROBABLY
HEADED
FOR
AAA
THE
ONLY
EFFECT
THE
INFIELD
FLY
HAS
IS
TO
MAKE
THE
BATTER
OUT
THEREBY
REMOVING
THE
FORCE
ON
THE
RUNNERS
ON
BASE
ALL
OTHER
RULES
APPLY
AS
IF
YOU
WERE
STANDING
SECOND
WITH
FIRST
OPEN
AND
THE
BALL
IS
POPPED
UP

IF
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
STICK
TO
THIS
DAMNED
QUANTUMJUMPING
THEN
I
REGRET
THAT
I
EVER
HAD
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
QUANTUM
