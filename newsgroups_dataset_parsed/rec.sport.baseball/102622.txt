fits
perfectly
in

could
be
there
is
a

writes
weekly

anyone

they

too
stark
has
done
this
sort
of
thing
but
he
has
never
been
serious
about
it
he
usually
states
that
this
sort
of
projection
is
useless
at
the
top
of
such
columns
i
think
he
did
it
one
season
and
some
manager
was
projected
to
be
thrown
out
of
games
and
some
hitter
could
expect
to
be
plunked
times
stark
does
some
really
funny
stuff
his
weekly
baseball
reviews
are
good
collections
of
strange
things
that
happened
during
the
previous
week
he
also
regularly
prints
