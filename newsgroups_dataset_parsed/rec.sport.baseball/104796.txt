this
leads
me
to
believe
that
its
not
really
a
rabbitball
year
and
that
weve
just
had
a
rash
of
highscoring
games
i
bet
this
one
days
worth
of
games
pulled
everything
back
to
close
to
average
interesting
because
the
other
day
all
but
three
games
had
ten
or
more
runs
scored
and
yesterday
no
game
had
more
than
nine
