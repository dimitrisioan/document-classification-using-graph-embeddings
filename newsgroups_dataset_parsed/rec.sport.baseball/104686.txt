MARK
SINGER
SAYS
WHY
WOULD
OWNERS
DECREASE
TICKET
PRICES
WHEN
THEY
OBVIOUSLY
GET
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
THEYRE
ASKING
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
ARE
WILLING
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
IM
SURE
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
IN
NETLAND
HAS
SOME
FACTS
ABOUT
TRENDS
IN
ATTENDANCE
REGARDING
PERCENTAGE
OF
CAPACITY
SOLD
BUT
EVEN
IF
THE
TRENDS
ARE
RELATIVELY
FLAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
CONSIDER
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
ON
A
TEAMBYTEAM
BASIS
WHEN
THE
TV
MONEY
DRIES
UP
FRANCHISES
WILL
BE
SEEKING
TO
SUPPLANT
THE
LOST
REVENUES
FROM
ALTERNATIVE
SOURCES
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
SOURCES
MAY
BE
TICKET
SALES
EXAMPLE
THE
DODGERS
THE
DODGERS
CAN
COUNT
ON
A
STRONG
BASE
OF
SEASON
TICKET
SALES
AND
PROBABLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THE
ABILITY
TO
RAISE
PRICES
WITHOUT
HINDERING
REVENUES
I
CERTAINLY
THINK
THAT
IS
TRUE
EXAMPLE
THE
PADRES
THEY
WILL
BE
LUCKY
TO
AVERAGE
FANS
A
GAME
THIS
YEAR
IF
THEY
RAISE
PRICES
LESS
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
INCREASE
THEIR
OVERALL
REVENUE
BASE
THE
BEST
THING
THEY
CAN
DO
IS
PUT
A
WINNING
TEAM
ON
THE
FIELD
BUT
GIVEN
THAT
WONT
HAPPEN
IT
WONT
THEY
CAN
PROBABLY
MAKE
MORE
MONEY
BY
LOWERING
TICKET
PRICES
AND
RUNNING
FREQUENT
PROMOTIONS
WILL
THEY
DO
THAT
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
BUT
THEY
WONT
INCREASE
PRICES
BECAUSE
IT
WONT
WORK
FOR
THEM
EVEN
ASSUMING
THAT
YOU
HAVE
SOME
STRANGE
POWER
TO
MAKE
THE
OWNERS
DECREASE
TICKET
PRICES
THAT
DOES
NOT
DECREASE
THE
TV
CONTRACT
THE
ONLY
STRANGE
POWERS
AT
WORK
HERE
ARE
THE
FORCES
OF
THE
MARKET
PLACE
EACH
TEAMS
MARKET
IS
SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT
AND
EACH
OWNER
IS
GOING
TO
BE
FACED
WITH
A
UNIQUE
SET
OF
CIRCUMSTANCES
ABOUT
HOW
TO
DEAL
WITH
THOSE
MARKET
FORCES
AS
A
BUINESS
MANAGER
I
WOULD
NEVER
WANT
TO
LOWER
MY
PRICES
BUT
SOMETIMES
THAT
STRATEGY
IS
NECESSARY
AND
SOMETIMES
IT
WORKS
YOU
HAVE
TO
CONSIDER
EVERYTHING
IF
YOU
WANT
CONTINUED
SUCCESS
