WROTE
IN
ANY
CASE
I
THINK
VIOLA
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
A
BETTER
SIGNING
WHY
VIOLA
IS
YOUNGER
AND
IS
LEFT
HANDED
HOW
MANY
LEFT
HANDED
STARTERS
DOES
TORONTO
HAVE
WELL
I
AGREE
THAT
VIOLA
IS
A
BETTER
SIGNING
HOWEVER
WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
SAY
THAT
YOU
WANT
LEFTHANDED
STARTERS
I
UNDERSTAND
LEFTHANDED
SPOT
RELIEVERS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
USUALLY
FACE
MORE
RIGHTHANDED
BATTERS
THAN
LEFTHANDED
BATTERS
I
JUST
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
PEOPLE
INSIST
ON
LEFTHANDED
STARTERS
UNLESS
THERE
IS
A
PARK
EFFECT
EG
YANKEE
STADIUM
MOST
BATTERS
IN
MLB
ARE
RIGHTHANDED
SO
RIGHTHANDED
STARTERS
WILL
HAVE
THE
PLATOON
ADVANTAGE
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
LEFTHANDED
STARTERS
I
GUESS
ONE
ARGUMENT
FOR
LEFTY
STARTERS
IS
THAT
CERTAIN
TEAMS
MAY
BE
MORE
VULNERABLE
TO
LHPS
THAN
RHPS
HOWEVER
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
ONLY
A
FACTOR
IN
THE
POSTSEASON
BECAUSE
TEAMS
SELDOM
JUGGLE
THEIR
STARTERS
FOR
THIS
REASON
DURING
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
I
THINK
YOU
JUST
WANT
THE
BEST
STARTERS
YOU
CAN
GET
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
LEFTIES
OR
RIGHTIES
LEFTHANDED
STARTERS
TEND
TO
HAVE
HIGHER
ERAS
THAN
RIGHTHANDED
STARTERS
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
MANAGERS
GO
OUT
OF
THEIR
WAY
TO
START
INFERIOR
LEFTIES
OR
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PLATOON
ADVANTAGE
AM
I
MISSING
SOMETHING
HERE
