this
is
what
jackson
looked
like
in
with
everything
converted
to
a
neutral
park
on
the
basis
of
run
production
his
equivalent
average
started
at
in
was
up
to
in
and
in
so
let
us
say
he
had
established
in
his
last
two
seasons
a
level
of
play
that
is
good
very
good
in

but
it

was
warranted
from
his
baseball
playing
though
his
hype
was
a
lot
better
than
his
hitting
that
is
the
basis
for
the
netcomments
about
him
being
overrated
the
media
would
have
you
beleive
he
was
a
great
hitter
i
think
he
was
a
good
maybe
very
good
hitter
he
was
imo
something
like
the
best
hitter
in
the
majors
