RE

MCWEEKLY
STATS
RVESTERMVMACCNDEDU
WRITES
SOME
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
WHETHER
ELIAS
IS
MONEY
GRUBBING
DELETED
FUNNY
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
STATS
MAJOR
LEAGUE
AND
MINOR
LEAGUE
HANDBOOKS
WHICH
ARE
NOTHING
BUT
COLLECTIONS
OF
STATISTICS
ARE
AUTHORED
BY
BILL
JAMES
AND
STATS
INC
AND
HOWE
FOR
THE
MINOR
LEAGUE
HANDBOOK
AND
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
THE
BILL
JAMES
PLAYER
RATINGS
BOOK
QUALIFIES
AS
A
BOOK
WITH
STATISTICS
WHILE
THE
ELIAS
ANALYST
IS
A
STATISTICS
BOOK
THE
ANALYST
CONTAINS
MORE
STATS
SURE
BUT
IT
ALSO
CONTAINS
MORE
DIALOGUE
FINALLY
THE
POINT
WAS
NOT
ABOUT
THE
WORD
STATISTICS
IT
WAS
ABOUT
MONEYGRUBBING
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
LOOKED
AT
THE
BILL
JAMES
PLAYER
RATINGS
BOOK
CANNOT
CONSIDER
HIM
MONEYGRUBBING
BOB
VESTERMAN
SOME
THOUGHTS
AND
FACTS
BILL
JAMES
IS
A
PARTIAL
OWNER
OF
STATS
INC
HOWEVER
HE
HAS
ALMOST
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
DAYTODAY
OPERATIONS
OF
THE
COMPANY
ALTHOUGH
HE
DOES
HAVE
SIGNIFICANT
INPUT
INTO
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
BOOKS
THAT
BEAR
HIS
NAME
THE
HANDBOOK
BUT
NOT
THE
SCOREBOARD
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
THE
ONLY
THINGS
THAT
BILL
ACTUALLY
WRITES
FOR
STATS
ARE
THE
PREDICTIONS
SECTION
OF
THE
HANDBOOK
AND
THE
BILL
JAMES
FANTASY
BASEBALL
RULEBOOK
THE
DEBATE
OVER
ELIAS
GOES
WAY
BACK
BILL
JAMES
EARLY
STUFF
WAS
HAMPERED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
ELIAS
WOULD
NOT
GIVE
ACCESS
TO
THEIR
STATS
AT
ANY
PRICE
PROJECT
SCORESHEET
AND
LATER
STATS
WERE
FOUNDED
TO
FILL
THIS
VOID
YOU
CAN
CALL
STATS
AND
ASK
THEM
FOR
A
REPORT
ON
JUST
ABOUT
ANYTHING
IN
THEIR
DATABASE
AND
THEY
WILL
PROVIDE
IT
FOR
A
PRICE
OF
COURSE
OR
YOU
COULD
JUST
LOG
INTO
THEIR
ONLINE
SYSTEM
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
DATA
YOURSELF
HAVING
ATTEMPTED
TO
PRY
NUMBERS
FROM
ELIAS
IN
THE
PAST
FOOTBALL
NOT
BASEBALL
THEY
JUST
DONT
DO
THAT
IN
STATS
EYES
THE
HIGH
GROUND
COMES
FROM
MAKING
THE
INFORMATION
AVAILABLE
AT
ALL
THAT
BEING
SAID
IM
PRETTY
DISSAPOINTED
BY
BILLS
BOOK
THIS
YEAR
TOO
I
AM
GIVEN
TO
UNDERSTANT
THAT
IT
WAS
MOSTLY
A
RESPONSE
TO
THE
PUBLISHERS
DESIRE
TO
HAVE
THE
BOOK
COME
OUT
SOONER
THAN
APRIL
HOPE
THIS
MAKES
THINGS
JUST
A
LITTLE
BIT
CLEARER
BIAS
ALERT
I
AM
A
FORMER
PARTTIME
EMPLOYEE
