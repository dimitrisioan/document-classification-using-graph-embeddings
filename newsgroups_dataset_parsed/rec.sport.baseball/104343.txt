I
CAME
ACROSS
THIS
FILE
FROM
LAST

THOUGHT
YOU
MIGHT

SOME
OF

THE

ON

INDICATED

LARGELY
OUT
OF

ME
WHAT
HAVE
I
DONE
I
COMPUTED
THE
EXPECTED
WINNING
PERCENTAGE
FOR
EACH
TEAM
FROM
THEIR
OBP
TOTAL
BASES
AND
RUNS
ALLOWED
I
USE
THE
BASIC
RC
FORMULA
AND
THE
PYTHAGOREAN
PROJECTION
I
THEN
COMPARE
THIS
WITH
THEIR
ACTUAL
WINNING
PERCENTAGE

THE

CRANKED
IN

SECOND

THE

PREDICTABLY
TOOK
A
DIVE
THAT
SHOULDNT
HAVE
SURPRISED
ANYBODY
MEANWHILE
AS
PREDICTED
THE

DROPPED
BEHIND
THE
ANGELS
AND
ROYALS
THEY
CLEARLY
DIDNT
DESERVE
THE
RECORD
IN
JUNE
THE
WHITE
SOX
AND
AS
UPPED
THEIR

A
BIT
WHILE
THE
TWINS
DROPPED
OFF
A
LITTLE
BUT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THINGS
WERE
AS
EXPECTED
OKAY
SO
THERE
WERE
A
FEW
BLATANT

FOR

I

YOU

ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR

WHY
DO
YOU

AND
IT
WAS

WISE
SINCE
HE

EITHER

THIS

I

HE
WILL

UP

I

HE
WILL

RBIS
IS
NOT
THAT
MUCH
OF
A

SOMETIMES
US
STATHEADS
GET
LUCKY
GRACE
DIDNT
HIT
BEHIND

THE
ENTIRE

BUT
HE
ALSO

WITH

RBIS
FROM

THE
MOST
BALLSY
PREDICTION

MARK
MCGWIRE

HIT

MORE

THIS

NOPE
HE
SLOWED

AND
THE

FINISHED
HIM

DIDNT
EVEN
REACH
BUT
A
BALLSY
PREDICTION
NONETHELESS
FROM
ECAXRONMARSLERCNASAGOV
THU
MAY
BALTIMORE
WILL
NOT
FADE
THEY
WILL
NOT
WIN
THE
DIVISION
THIS
YEAR
BUT
THEY
WILL
FINISH
WITHIN
FIVE
GAMES
I
FIND
THE
PROSPECT
OF
TWO
ORIOLES
WINNING
EACH
EASIER
TO
COMPREHEND
THAN
THAT
OF
TWO
SOX
NO
OFFENSE
I
THINK
THEIR
PITCHING
IS
ABOUT
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
DIVISION
HAS
TO
OFFER
THE
ORIOLES
FINISHED
SEVEN
GAMES
OUT
NONE
OF
THEM
WON
THOUGH
MUSSINA
MIGHT
HAVE
HAD
A
CHANCE
WITH
BETTER
RELIEF
AND
MORE
STARTS
NOBODY
ELSE
IN
THE
DIVISION
IS
WORTH
A
DARN
THEY
ALL
FINISH
A
MINIMUM
OF
FIFTEEN
GAMES
OUT
THE
TRIBE
THATS
ANOTHER
REASON
TO
WATCH
BALTIMORE
THIS
YEAR
AND
NEXT
THEY
WONT
WASTE
MANY
OF
THOSE
GAMES
AGAINST
THE
REST
OF
THE
DIVISION
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
BREWERS
WHO
YOU
PROBABLY
FORGOT
YOU
WERE
RIGHT
THE
REST
OF
THE

WAS
THOROUGHLY
MEDIOCRE
THE
YANKEES
AND
INDIANS
LED
WITH

THE
RED

TRAILED

NONE
WERE
HORRIBLE

WERE
FIVE

THU
AUG
GMT
RIGHT
THAT
WAS
ME
I
NEVER
SAID
THE
JAYS
WERE
A
CINCH
TO
CLINCH
IT
BUT
I
SAID
THAT
MILWAUKEE
WILL
BE
MORE
OF
A
THREAT
THAN
BALTIMORE
I
DO
THINK
THAT
TORONTO
SHOULD
WIN
IT
BUT
AFTER
I
DONT
CONSIDER
ANYTHING
A
CINCH
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
GAME
LEAD
WITH
GAMES
TO
GO
I
DO
THINK
THAT
THE
JAYS
HAVE
THE
BEST
TALENTED
TEAM
IN
THE
AL
EAST
AND
IF
WE
HAD
A
GOOD
OR
EVEN
AVERAGE
MANAGER
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
A
BIGGER
LEAD
RIGHT
NOW
I
ALSO
THINK
THAT
THE
ORIOLES
WILL
NOT
PLAY
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
BASEBALL
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE

YOU
WIN

THE

MADDUX
SURPRISED
ALL
THE

WILL
WIN

IN
AT

OF
THE

PROBABLY
THE

THEIR
PITCHING
STAFF
WILL
HAVE
A

ERA
AMONG
THE

IN

IN
AT

OF
THE
NEXT

BUT
NOT
NECESSARILY
ALL
THE

AS
THEY
WIN
THIS
ONE
WILL
TAKE
A
LONG
TIME
TO
VERIFY
I
DONT
THINK
I
WANT
TO
WAIT
THAT
LONG
BUT
THEY
WON
GAMES
LAST

AND
THEY
WERE
FIFTH
IN
THE

IN

NOT
A
BAD

BEN
MCDONALD
WILL

IN

WILL

EITHER

BY

I
MEAN
FINISH

BEING
AMONG
THE

BEFORE
THE

IS
DONE
DOESNT
COUNT
HE
WILL
PROBABLY
NEVER
BE
THE
PITCHER
HE
WAS
HYPED
TO
BE
BUT
IS
STILL
A
DECENT
STARTER
TO
HAVE
LOOKS
LIKE
IT
HE
WASNT
BAD
LAST

JUST
TOO
CONSISTENT
TO
BE
AN

NOT
