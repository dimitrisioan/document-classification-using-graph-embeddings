where
did

from
i
would
have
to
say
that
they
are
about
even
i
believe
acker
got
a
ring
from
his
wife
when
they
were
married
the
blue
jays
had
such
a
strong
offense
dont
tell
me
that
morris
has
this
magical
ability
to
cause
the
offensive
players
to
score
more
runs
i
dont
know
why
you
guys
keep
bickering
about
morris
the
stats
show
he
is
a
mediocre
pitcher
at
best
this
year
is
another
case
he
just
happened
to
win
games
i
saw
many
of
his
games
last
year
he
did
pitch
some
good
games
but
this
crap
about
being
a
clutch
pitcher
is
nonsense
he
was
constantly
giving
up
go
ahead
runs
in
the
innings
the
clutch
innings
and
the
jays
would
somehow
scrape
a
win
for
him
another
major
factor
in
his
wins
is
that
cito
i
dont
realize
i
have
a
bullpen
gaston
would
leave
morris
in
for
ever
therefore
giving
him
many
more
chances
to
win
games
i
believe
this
is
the
major
reason
he
won
games
last
year
