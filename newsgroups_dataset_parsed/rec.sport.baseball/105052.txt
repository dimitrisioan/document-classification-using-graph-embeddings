RE
JACK
MORRIS
IN
ARTICLE
SHAWN
LUDDINGTON
WRITES
WHERE
DID
ACKER
GET
A
RING
FROM
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THEY
ARE
ABOUT
EVEN
I
BELIEVE
ACKER
GOT
A
RING
FROM
HIS
WIFE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
MARRIED
THE
BLUE
JAYS
HAD
SUCH
A
STRONG
OFFENSE
DONT
TELL
ME
THAT
MORRIS
HAS
THIS
MAGICAL
ABILITY
TO
CAUSE
THE
OFFENSIVE
PLAYERS
TO
SCORE
MORE
RUNS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
YOU
GUYS
KEEP
BICKERING
ABOUT
MORRIS
THE
STATS
SHOW
HE
IS
A
MEDIOCRE
PITCHER
AT
BEST
THIS
YEAR
IS
ANOTHER
CASE
HE
JUST
HAPPENED
TO
WIN
GAMES
I
SAW
MANY
OF
HIS
GAMES
LAST
YEAR
HE
DID
PITCH
SOME
GOOD
GAMES
BUT
THIS
CRAP
ABOUT
BEING
A
CLUTCH
PITCHER
IS
NONSENSE
HE
WAS
CONSTANTLY
GIVING
UP
GO
AHEAD
RUNS
IN
THE
INNINGS
THE
CLUTCH
INNINGS
AND
THE
JAYS
WOULD
SOMEHOW
SCRAPE
A
WIN
FOR
HIM
ANOTHER
MAJOR
FACTOR
IN
HIS
WINS
IS
THAT
CITO
I
DONT
REALIZE
I
HAVE
A
BULLPEN
GASTON
WOULD
LEAVE
MORRIS
IN
FOR
EVER
THEREFORE
GIVING
HIM
MANY
MORE
CHANCES
TO
WIN
GAMES
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
THE
MAJOR
REASON
HE
WON
GAMES
LAST
YEAR
