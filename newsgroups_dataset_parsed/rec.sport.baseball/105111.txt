BROWN

H
WRITES
I
WATCHED
THE
FINAL
INNING
OF
BOSIOS
NOHITTER
WITH
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
AT
WORK
AFTER
VIZQUEL
MADE
THAT
BAREHANDED
GRAB
OF
THE
CHOPPER
UP
THE
MIDDLE
SOMEONE
REMARKED
THAT
IF
HE
HAD
FIELDED
IT
WITH
HIS
GLOVE
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
HAD
TIME
TO
THROW
RILES
OUT
YET
THE
THROW
BEAT
RILES
BY
ABOUT
TWO
STEPS
I
WONDER
HOW
MANY
OTHERS
WHO
WATCHED
THE
FINAL
OUT
THINK
VIZQUEL
HAD
NO
CHOICE
BUT
TO
MAKE
THE
PLAY
WITH
HIS
BARE
HAND
IN
THIS
MORNINGS
PAPER
OR
WAS
IT
ON
THE
RADIO
VIZQUEL
WAS
QUOTED
AS
SAYING
THAT
HE
COULD
HAVE
FIELDED
THE
BALL
WITH
HIS
GLOVE
AND
STILL
EASILY
THROWN
OUT
RILES
THAT
HE
BAREHANDED
IT
INSTEAD
SO
AS
TO
MAKE
THE
FINAL
PLAY
MORE
MEMORABLE
SEEMS
A
LITLE
COCKY
TO
ME
BUT
HE
MADE
IT
WORK
SO
HES
ENTITLED
I
GUESS
SO
STILL
THATS
KIND
OF
A
STUPID
MOVE
IMO
HED
BE
SINGING
A
DIFFERENT
TUNE
IF
HE
HAD
BOOTED
IT
AND
THE
NEXT
GUY
UP
HAD
HIT
A
BLOOP
SINGLE
STRANGER
THINGS
HAVE
HAPPENED
HEY
I
USED
TO
BE
A
BIG
DAVE
STIEB
FAN
AND
UNFORTUNATELY
THERES
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
AN
UNEARNED
HIT
CHEERS
