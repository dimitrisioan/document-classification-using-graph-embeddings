HOW
TO
START
CARDINALS
MAILING
LIST
OK
IT
WOULD
BE
A
SHAME
FOR
CARDS
FANS
ON
THE
NET
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
CHAMPIONSHIP
SEASON
WITHOUT
A
MAILING
LIST
TO
TALK
ON
SO
I
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
LOOK
AT
STARTING
ONE
EXCEPT
THERES
ONE
LITTLE
PROBLEM
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
FIRST
THING
ABOUT
HOW
TO
DO
IT
OR
WHAT
IT
REQUIRES
IN
TERMS
OF
RESOURCES
OR
TIME
SO
IF
SOME
KIND
SOUL
COULD
EMAIL
ME
THE
PARTICULARS
OF
GETTING
STARTING
AND
MANAGING
A
MAIL
LIST
ID
SEE
IF
IT
WOULD
BE
FEASIBLE
FOR
ME
TO
START
A
CARDS
MAILING
LIST
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
