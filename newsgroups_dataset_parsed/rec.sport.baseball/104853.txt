WHY
IN

WRITES
YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT
BRAVES
FANS
ARE
NOTHING
BUT
A
BUNCH
OF
BANDWAGONERS
CORRECT
ME
IF
I
AM
WRONG
BUT
OR
YEARS
AGO
YOU
COULDNT
GIVE
AWAY
A
TICKET
TO
SEE
THE
BRAVES
PLAYI
WOULD
BET
MY
NEXT
PAYCHECK
THAT
OF
THE
SOCALLED
BRAVES
FANS
LIVING
OUTSIDE
OF
GEORGIA
AT
THE
PRESENT
TIME
CAN
NOT
NAME
MORE
THAN

HOWM
I
DOING
SO
FAR
NOTE
I
AM
NOT
A
BRAVES
FUNN
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ASK
ANY
CUBS
FAN
LIVING
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
TO
NAME
PLAYERS
FROM
ANY
GIVEN
YEAR
AND
OF
THEM
PROBABLY
COULD
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
II
LIKE
THE
BRAVES
MUCH
MORE
THAN
THE
CUBS
AND
ALL
I
CAN
NAME
IS
RON
SANTO
ERNIE
BANKS
AND
DON
KESSINGER
FROM
MY
FAVORITE
CUBBIE
SEASON
GRANTED
THE
FACT
THAT
A
TEAM
WINS
BRINGS
PEOPLE
TO
THE
BALL
PARK
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THEY
DISERVE
THE
TITLE
AMERICAS
TEAM
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEY
ARE
CONSIDERED
AMERICAS
TEAM
IS
BECAUSE
OF
TED
TURNER
AND
HIS
LITTLE
TV
STATION
WHICH
BROADCASTS
ACROSS
THE
NATION
RIGHT
IVE
WATCHED
ENOUGH
BRAVES
GAMES
TO
KNOW
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
THEIR
PLAYERS
I
LIKE
MANY
OF
THEIR
PLAYERS
THE
ONLY
CUBS
GAMES
I
GET
TO
SEE
WHILE
LIVING
IN
NEW
YORK
ARE
THOSE
AGAINST
THE
METS
AND
THEY
PUT
ME
TO
SLEEP
BECAUSE
FACE
IT
WATCHING
GUYS
LIKE
RICK
SUTCLIFFE
AND
LUIS
SALAZAR
DOESNT
PUT
ME
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
MY
CHAIRU
ILL
CONSIDER
TORONTO
AMERICAS
TEAM
BEFORE
THE
BRAVES
ACTUALLY
I
NOTICE
A
LOT
OF
ANTITORONTO
SENTIMENT
HERE
IN
THE
STATES
PARTLY
BECAUSE
OF
SOME
OF
THAT
POSTSERIES
ARROGANCE
THANKS
IN
PART
TO
UPSIDEDOWN
FLAG
DORK
POSTS
PARTLY
BECAUSE
ROBERTO
ALOMAR
IS
ABOUT
AS
EXCITING
AS
SWISS
CHEESE
AND
PARTLY
BECAUSE
LIVING
IN
BALTIMORE
DURING
THE
WINTERS
IVE
BECOME
SO
FOND
OF
OS
FANS
ESPECIALLY
THOSE
WHO
CALL
IN
TO
REX
BARNEYS
RADIO
SHOW
THAT
I
HAVE
TO
SIDE
AGAINST
THEIR
MOST
HATED
RIVALS
GO

SORRY
BUT
