spanky
is
too
slow
if
he
were
quicker
he
would
still
be
here
but
with
slaught
and
tom
prince
they
didnt
want
to
lose
prince
in
order
to
bring
up
that
pitcher
slaught
is
about
as
good
as
spanky
and
prince
is
coming
along
nicely
tom
prince
is
a
year
old
nohit
catcher
think
of
him
as
a
young
dann
bilardello
or
a
young
don
bordello
i
cant
begin
to
fathom
why
the
pirates
have
been
so
afraid
of
losing
this
guy
whos
been
in
aaa
most
of
the
last
seasons
the
pirates
released
kirk
gibson
last
year
because
prince
was
out
of
options
then
eventually
sent
prince
down
anyway
and
he
cleared
waivers
without
a
peep
hes
another
year
older
and
still
cant
hit
why
do
they
think
he
wouldnt
clear
waivers
now
why
would
they
care
theres
a
strong
possibility
that
the
bucs
have
absolutely
no
other
catching
prospects
in
the
minors
at
this
point
at
least
nobody
ready
for
any
serious
aaamajors
duty
the
main
reason
they
might
have
stayed
with
prince
could
be
just
age
especially
if
spanky
was
creeping
toward
his
or
something
all
things
considered
though
id
be
a
lot
more
comfortable
with
spanky
behind
the
plate
than
prince
isnt
there
decent
backup
backstop
out
there
looking
for
work
