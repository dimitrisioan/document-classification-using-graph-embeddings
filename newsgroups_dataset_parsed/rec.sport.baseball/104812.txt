can
anybody
figure
out
why
some
box
score
abbreviations
make
absolutely
no
sense
at
least
in
the
local
gannett
rag
that
finds
its
way
to
my
door
i
must
have
stared
at
cleman
in
the
mets
box
for
a
good
seconds
this
morning
wondering
who
the
hell
it
was
wouldnt
it
make
more
sense
to
use
colemn
ive
seen
it
as
colmn
also
blame
the
associated
press
after
the
official
scorer
balances
the
official
score
card
they
copy
it
and
give
it
to
several
diffent
people
one
of
those
is
a
person
from
ap
whose
job
it
is
to
type
it
up
using
a
template
on
a
laptop
and
transmit
it
to
the
ap
offices
in
new
york
rockefeller
center
via
the
telephone
the
box
scores
are
not
checked
and
just
rebroadcasted
over
aps
news
delivery
services
if
there
are
corrections
those
are
issued
later
it
is
the
person
sitting
in
front
of
a
laptop
at
shea
or
whereever
whose
fault
that
is
note
the
ap
puts
out
boxscores
in
three
different
formats
with
the
one
you
see
in
most
newspapers
being
the
first
one
not
totally
true
for
the
past
year
or
two
the
ap
has
been
getting
box
scores
from
stats
inc
the
ap
representative
in
the
press
box
is
actually
a
stats
reporter
dollars
a
game
but
free
parking
and
anybody
can
do
it
the
box
is
downloaded
to
stats
in
chicago
some
quick
error
checking
is
done
and
then
stats
sends
it
to
the
ap
im
not
sure
where
the
appreveiations
come
in
hear
i
dont
think
it
is
at
statss
it
may
just
be
a
space
correction
by
the
ap
sports
editor
that
day
while
im
mentioning
stats
reporters
they
are
always
looking
for
new
people
especially
if
you
live
in
cleveland
or
pittsburgh
youre
road
to
getting
into
the
press
box
may
be
real
short
for
more
info
call
stats
and
ask
about
the
reporter
network
its
a
fun
way
to
get
paid
for
watching
baseball
games
end
of
public
service
announcement
last
week
they
were
in
denver
maybe
the
ap
person
in
denver
did
this
remember
they
just
started
with
mlb
out
there
check
tomorrows
paper
and
see
if
the
person
who
is
doing
it
from
shea
does
the
same
thing
