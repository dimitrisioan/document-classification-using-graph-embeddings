TEAMS
AS
ORGANISMS
STATS
OR
STATS
WAS
RE
JACK
MORRIS
NOTE
IM
NOT
POSTING
THIS
AS
PART
OF
AN
ARGUMENT
WITH
ROGER
MEYNARD
BUT
AS
AN
INDEPENDENT
SORT
OF
THREAD
I
DO
ACTUALLY
QUOTE
SOME
THINGS
THAT
ROGER
MEYNARD
WROTE
BUT
IT
MIGHT
BE
BETTER
TO
THINK
OF
THIS
AS
SAMPLING
HIS
POST
IN
THE
HIPHOP
SENSE
BECAUSE
IT
FITS
IN
WITH
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
SAY
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
BUT
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THE
ONLY
DECISION
MAKING
PRO
CESS
USED
TO
DETERMINE
THE
BEST
IS
THE
SCORE
OF
THE
GAME
AND
IT
RE
LATES
TO
THE
TEAMS
NOT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PLAYERS
THERE
IS
NO
METHOD
INHERENT
IN
BASEBALL
OF
COMPARING
INDIVIDUAL
PERFORMANCES
AND
THAT
IS
HOW
IT
SHOULD
BE
BECAUSE
AFTER
ALL
BASEBALL
IS
A
TEAM
GAME
THERES
AN
INTERESTING
PARALLEL
BETWEEN
THIS
WAY
OF
VIEWING
A
BASEBALL
TEAM
AND
SOME
PEOPLES
CONCEPTION
OF
A
BIOLOGICAL
ORGANISM
IN
THE
BIOLOGY
CONTEXT
WE
WOULD
VERY
LIKELY
READ
FITNESS
FOR
THE
SCORE
OF
THE
GAME
AND
ORGANISMS
FOR
TEAMS
HOW
WE
INTERPRET
PLAYERS
IS
TRICKIER
BUT
EITHER
ORGANS
OR
GENES
MIGHT
SEEM
REASONABLE
CHOICES
DEPENDING
ON
WHAT
POINT
WE
WERE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
A
GENES
INTERPRETATION
ACTUALLY
MIGHT
BE
REALLY
INTERESTING
IN
THIS
CASE
BUT
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
DIFFERENT
AND
PROBABLY
LONGER
POST
IF
HOWEVER
WE
TAKE
THE
ORGAN
VIEW
THEN
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
BIOLOGY
SHOULD
MAKE
US
PAUSE
BEFORE
WE
START
SAYING
THINGS
LIKE
SPECIES
X
IS
MORE
FIT
THAN
SPECIES
Y
BECAUSE
OF
A
BETTER
ORGAN
Z
GIVEN
WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
INTERDEPENDENCE
OF
ORGANS
WE
WOULD
OFTEN
BE
SUSPICIOUS
OF
SUCH
CLAIMS
BUT
NOTE
THAT
THIS
TYPE
OF
ARGUMENT
IS
QUITE
OFTEN
MADE
WHEN
YOU
MAP
SPECIES
X
ONTO
HUMANS
AND
ORGAN
Z
ONTO
BRAIN
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
SOME
STATEMENTS
OF
THIS
KIND
DO
SEEM
MORE
REASONABLE
THAN
OTHERS
AS
FAR
AS
WE
CAN
TEST
THEM
EG
BRAIN
ABOVE
MIGHT
BE
MORE
REASONABLE
THAN
PANCREAS
ASSUMING
NO
GROSS
PATHOLOGY
PARTICULARLY
IF
SPECIES
Y
IS
A
PRIMATE
EVEN
WHEN
YOU
MAKE
SUCH
STATEMENTS
YOU
SHOULD
BE
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
FUNCTIONING
OF
THE
WHOLE
ORGANISM
AND
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
ONE
ORGAN
MIGHT
BE
MORE
CRUCIAL
FOR
ONE
SPECIES
AND
A
SECOND
ORGAN
IN
ANOTHER
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
NO
ORGAN
IS
PARTICULARLY
CRUCIAL
IN
SOME
THIRD
SPECIES
HOWEVER
IF
WE
ARE
NONVITALISTS
WITH
ANY
KIND
OF
REDUCTIONSIT
STREAK
WE
WILL
WANT
TO
SAY
THAT
AN
ORGANISM
IS
NOT
SOME
COMPLETELY
MAGICAL
UNANALYZABLE
WHOLE
BUT
AN
INTRIGUING
PROCESS
MADE
UP
OF
VARIOUS
SUBPROCESSES
THAT
INTERACT
IN
WAYS
THAT
ARE
POTENTIALLY
OBSERVABLE
SOME
OF
THESE
PROCESSES
MIGHT
BE
LOCALIZED
TO
PARTICULAR
ORGANS
WHILE
OTHERS
MAY
BE
DISTRIBUTED
ACROSS
MULTIPLE
ORGANS
IN
A
WAY
THIS
IS
JUST
LIKE
A
BASEBALL
TEAM
EXCEPT
THAT
I
THINK
IT
IS
PRETTY
CLEAR
THAT
THE
PROCESSES
AND
INTERACTIONS
INVOLVED
IN
BASEBALL
ARE
MUCH
SIMPLER
AND
LESS
NUMEROUS
THAN
IN
MOST
ORGANISMS
TO
SAY
THAT
ONE
PLAYER
IS
BETTER
THAN
ANOTHER
IS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SAY
AB
SOLUTELY
THAT
PLAYER
AS
TEAM
WOULD
HAVE
PLAYED
BETTER
WITH
PLAYER
B
IN
THEIR
LINEUP
SHEER
SPECULATION
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ASCERTAIN
ONE
THING
THAT
IS
QUITE
DIFFICULT
ABOUT
BASEBALL
IS
THAT
PERFECTLY
CONTROLLED
EXPERIMENTS
ARE
SOMETIMES
VERY
TOUGH
TO
DO
BUT
OF
COURSE
THIS
HAS
NEVER
STOPPED
RESEARCHERS
FROM
DOING
THE
BEST
THEY
CAN
AND
SOMETIMES
DERIVING
VERY
POWERFUL
CONCLUSIONS
EVEN
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
CERTAINTY
MOST
OF
THIS
GOES
FAR
BEYOND
SHEER
SPECULATION
BUT
EVEN
SHEER
SPECULATION
CAN
MOTIVATE
FURTHER
INTERESTING
RESEARCH
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
SELECT
A
GROUP
OF
STATISTICS
AND
CLAIM
THAT
CLEMENS
HAS
DONE
BETTER
THAN
ANOTHER
PITCHER
WITH
THOSE
STATISTICS
AS
A
CRITERIA
THEN
FINE
IN
THIS
CASES
WERE
SEEING
THE
WORD
STATISTICS
MEANS
SUMMARY
OF
OBSERVED
EVENTS
WHERE
THE
EVENTS
THEMSELVES
CAN
BE
VIEWED
AS
THE
OUTPUT
OF
SOME
PROCESS
AND
POSSIBLY
INPUTS
FOR
OTHER
PROCESSES
THUS
IF
WE
HAVE
ANY
VALID
NOTION
OF
HOW
THE
PROCESSES
ARE
PUT
TOGETHER
INTO
THE
FUNCTIONING
ORGANISM
DATA
IN
THE
FORM
OF
STATISTICS
MIGHT
GIVE
US
A
BASIS
TO
TEST
PARTICULAR
HYPOTHESES
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
PROVE
THAT
THOSE
STATISTICS
MEASURE
THE
INDIVIDUALS
CONTRIBUTION
TO
WINNING
THE
WS
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
ONLY
MEASURE
OF
BEST
THAT
HAS
ANY
MEANING
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
BASEBALL
THIS
STATEMENT
BRINGS
US
BACK
TO
THE
CONCEPT
OF
FITNESS
AGAIN
FITNESS
IS
DEFINED
IN
TERMS
OF
BOTH
AN
ORGANISM
AND
ITS
ENVIRONMENT
YOU
MIGHT
BE
FIT
IN
ONE
SITUATION
AND
NOT
ANOTHER
MOVING
TO
BASEBALL
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
EACH
TEAM
SPENDS
THE
ENTIRE
SEASON
IN
AN
ENVIRONMENT
INCLUDING
ALL
THE
OTHER
TEAMS
IN
THE
LEAGUE
IN
AT
LEAST
A
NOMINAL
SENSE
THE
DIVISION
WINNERS
ARE
THE
FITTEST
TEAMS
IN
THE
LEAGUE
IN
THAT
THEY
ON
AVERAGE
HAD
BETTER
FITNESS
SCORES
THAN
ANY
OF
THEIR
COMPETING
OPPONENNTS
BUT
IN
A
REAL
SENSE
THERE
IS
A
FAIRLY
LARGE
RANDOM
COMPONENT
IN
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
EACH
TEAM
THAT
IS
DIFFICULT
IF
NOT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
IN
TERMS
OF
FACTORS
INTRINSIC
TO
OR
INTERESTING
FOR
BASEBALL
THE
SAME
IS
TRUE
IN
BIOLOGY
BUT
HERE
IS
ALSO
NO
DIRECT
BIOLOGICAL
EQUIVALENT
OF
THE
WORLD
SERIES
IN
BASEBAL
IN
THE
WORLD
SERIES
THE
RANDOM
COMPONENT
MAY
BE
GREATLY
MAGNIFIED
BY
THE
SMALL
NUMBER
OF
GAMES
THAT
ARE
PLAYED
AND
BOTH
TEAMS
SUDDENLY
EXPERIENCE
HUGE
CHANGES
FROM
THE
ENVIRONEMENT
WHERE
THEY
WERE
ORIGINALLY
SUCCESSFUL
IT
MIGHT
BE
FUN
TO
WATCH
BUT
ITS
UNCLEAR
WHAT
IT
ALL
REALLY
MEANS
NOW
JUST
ONE
MORE
UNRELATED
POINT
I
HAVE
YET
TO
SEE
THAT
ANY
OF
YOU
CAN
PREDICT
A
WS
WINNER
WITH
ANY
GREATER
ACCURACY
THAN
JEANNE
DIXON
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
YOU
HAVE
SEEN
SOME
OF
US
WHO
CAN
PREDICT
THE
OUTCOME
OF
THE
DIVISIONAL
RACES
BETTER
THAN
A
RANDOM
ASSIGNMENT
OF
TEAMS
TO
FINISHES
AND
MAYBE
SOME
OF
US
EG
ME
WHO
CAN
DO
THIS
BETTER
THAN
THE
OTHER
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THIS
FORUM
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
BUT
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
ONLY
DUE
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
A
SCHEDULE
GIVES
YOU
A
LITTLE
HOPE
THAT
BAD
HOPS
ARENT
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
WINNERS
AND
THE
LOSERS
MOREOVER
YOUVE
HAD
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
SEE
SOME
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
WORLD
SERIES
SITUATION
THAT
MAKES
THE
STRONG
CLAIM
THAT
NOBODY
CAN
PREDICT
THE
WS
WINNER
WITH
RELIABLY
GREATER
ACCURACY
THAN
A
COIN
BIASED
ONLY
TO
REFLECT
THE
WELLKNOWN
HOME
VS
ROAD
EFFECT
ON
WINNING
PERCENTAGE
THE
STATS
ARE
A
NICE
HOBBY
AND
THATS
ABOUT
IT
THERE
IS
NO
NEW
KNOWLEDGE
BEING
PRODUCED
SINCE
STATS
ARE
SUMMARIES
OF
EVENTS
ITS
TRUE
THAT
IF
YOU
KNOW
THE
EVENTS
YOU
CAN
DERIVE
THE
STATS
BUT
IF
SOMEBODY
IS
TRYING
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
PROCESS
BEHIND
THE
STATS
THEN
THE
STATS
PRODUCE
NEW
KNOWLEDGE
AND
SOME
OF
THIS
MIGHT
EVEN
BE
RELIABLE
REPEATABLE
AND
USEFUL
SPEAKING
OF
WHICH
I
SHOULD
GET
BACK
TO
PRODUCING
KNOWLEDGE
IN
A
DIFFERENT
FIELD
THAT
IS
OF
COURSE
IF
I
CAN
PRODUCE
KNOWLEDGE
EVEN
THOUGH
IM
RELYING
ON
STATS
TO
DO
IT
JKING
