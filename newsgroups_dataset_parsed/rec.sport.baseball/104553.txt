THE
LIBERALIZER
WRITES
ACTUALLY
I
KIND
OF
LIKED
THE
ABOTT
TRADE
WE
DID
TRADE
THE
ROOKIE
OF
THE
YEAR
SNOW
BUT
WITH
DON
MATTINGLY
AT
FIRST
FOR
ANOTHER
YEARS
WHY
BOTHER
ID
BE
WILLING
TO
MAKE
TWO
WAGERS
SNOW
DOESNT
WIN
ROY
MATTINGLY
IS
OUT
OF
BASEBALL
WITHIN
FIVE
YEARS
IM
SKEPTICAL
OF
THE
FIRST
BECAUSE
I
DONT
THINK
SNOW
IS
THAT
GOOD
A
PLAYER
AND
HE
IS
ON
A
LOSING
TEAM
IM
SKEPTICAL
OF
THE
SECOND
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
BACK
MATTINGLY
IS
THIS
YEAR
AND
HOW
MANY
PLAYERS
PLAY
UNTIL
THEY
ARE
NOT
TOO
MANY
AND
MOST
OF
THEM
DIDNT
HAVE
CHRONIC
BACK
PROBLEMS
WHEN
THEY
WERE
COULD
BE
WRONG
ON
EITHER
OR
BOTH
BUT
I
THINK
THATS
THE
SMART
WAY
TO
BET
CHEERS
VALENTINE
