RE
AND
AMERICAS
TEAM
ISBUT
WHY
IN
WRITES
YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT
BRAVES
FANS
ARE
NOTHING
BUT
A
BUNCH
OF
BANDWAGONERS
CORRECT
ME
IF
I
AM
WRONG
BUT
OR
YEARS
AGO
YOU
COULDNT
GIVE
AWAY
A
TICKET
TO
SEE
THE
BRAVES
PLAYI
WOULD
BET
MY
NEXT
PAYCHECK
THAT
OF
THE
SOCALLED
BRAVES
FANS
LIVING
OUTSIDE
OF
GEORGIA
AT
THE
PRESENT
TIME
CAN
NOT
NAME
MORE
THAN
PLAYERS
FROM
THEIR
SEASON
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ASK
ANY
CUBS
FAN
LIVING
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
TO
NAME
PLAYERS
FROM
ANY
GIVEN
YEAR
AND
OF
THEM
PROBABLY
COULD
YOU
COULD
BE
RIGHT
THEN
AGAIN
YOU
COULD
BE
WRONG
THIS
CLAIM
IS
COMPLETELY
UNVERIFIABLE
AND
UNTESTABLE
ID
WAGER
MOST
OF
THE
BRAVES
FANS
ON
THE
NET
COULD
NAME
MORE
THAN
PLAYERS
FROM
THEIR
SEASON
YOU
COULD
GIVE
AWAY
TICKETS
TO
BRAVES
GAMES
HOWEVER
MY
DAD
AND
I
WERE
ABLE
TO
GET
GREAT
SEATS
FROM
SCALPER
FOR
FACE
VALUE
WHICH
ISNT
EXACTLY
THE
SIGN
OF
A
HOT
TICKET
GRANTED
THE
FACT
THAT
A
TEAM
WINS
BRINGS
PEOPLE
TO
THE
BALL
PARK
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THEY
DISERVE
THE
TITLE
AMERICAS
TEAM
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEY
ARE
CONSIDERED
AMERICAS
TEAM
IS
BECAUSE
OF
TED
TURNER
AND
HIS
LITTLE
TV
STATION
WHICH
BROADCASTS
ACROSS
THE
NATION
THIS
IS
PRECISELY
WHY
THEY
WERE
CONSIDERED
AMERICAS
TEAM
EVEN
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BAD
YOU
COULD
SEE
MOST
OF
THE
BRAVES
GAMES
ON
CABLE
YOU
COULD
DO
THAT
FOR
THE
CUBS
AS
WELL
BUT
THE
BRAVES
HAD
BETTER
CAMERAWORK
BETTER
ANNOUNCERS
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
RATHER
LISTEN
TO
HARRY
DISCUSS
THE
GAME
OR
SKIP
AND
PETE
DISCUSS
MOTOBALL
AND
TEAMS
THAT
WERENT
TOO
MUCH
WORSE
BECAUSE
OF
TBS
THE
BRAVES
HAD
A
LOT
OF
FANS
OUTSIDE
OF
GEORGIA
AT
HOME
IN
KENTUCKY
EVEN
THOUGH
WE
WERE
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
CINCINNATI
THERE
WAS
AS
MANY
BRAVES
FANS
AS
REDS
FANS
EVEN
IN
YOU
COULD
ACTUALLY
WATCH
THE
BRAVES
PLAY
YOU
HAD
TO
GO
TO
CINCINNATI
TO
WATCH
THE
REDS
I
CAN
GO
ANYWHERE
IN
AMERICA
AND
WATCH
THE
BRAVES
ILL
CONSIDER
TORONTO
AMERICAS
TEAM
BEFORE
THE
BRAVES
WHY
ID
GUESS
THAT
BRAVES
FANS
ARE
MORE
WIDELY
DISTRIBUTED
THAN
TORONTO
