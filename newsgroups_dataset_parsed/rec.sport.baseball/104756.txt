dont
you
guys
think
so
i
mean
cmon
what
the
heck
are
women
doing
even
thinking
of
getting
into
baseball
oh
i
dont
know
maybe
because
they
love
the
game
they
cause
so
many
problems
just
look
at
lisa
olson
remember
that
feisty
reporter
that
entered
the
new
england
patriots
locker
room
she
started
crying
like
a
little
girl
so
people
deal
with
unfair
treatment
differently
i
suppose
you
would
have
more
respect
if
she
punched
out
some
people
like
a
stereotypical
macho
man
would
have
done
i
just
dont
think
women
belong
in
a
mans
sport
before
you
smart
guys
flame
me
for
this
i
know
the
given
example
was
about
football
who
cares
it
still
applies
to
other
male
sports
male
sports
are
only
that
way
because
they
wont
let
women
be
involved
there
is
no
divine
providence
segregating
sports
it
is
the
decision
of
the
men
who
run
it
men
almost
as
liberal
thinking
as
you
how
can
we
have
women
umpires
ummmby
insisting
they
pass
an
accredited
umpire
course
then
hiring
them
jeez
look
at
pam
postema
just
because
shes
a
woman
everybody
on
the
face
of
the
earth
thinks
its
great
that
shes
getting
an
opportunity
to
ump
if
you
even
watched
the
games
and
had
an
iq
greater
than
that
of
roast
beef
youd
see
that
she
is
not
nearly
as
good
as
most
aaa
umpires
besides
she
is
probably
more
worried
about
cracking
a
fingernail
with
a
foul
tip
off
of
wade
boggs
bat
or
jose
oquendos
bat
listen
mr
status
quo
i
know
pam
postema
ive
seen
her
work
she
is
without
question
the
toughest
person
ive
ever
met
she
doesnt
give
a
damn
about
her
fingernails
but
does
care
about
working
the
game
shes
not
there
to
find
a
man
to
take
care
of
her
but
to
do
the
best
job
any
umpire
can
do
your
bullshit
comments
are
obviously
tailored
to
show
off
the
red
on
you
neck
not
your
grasp
on
society
theres
nothing
wrong
with
a
red
neck
why
some
of
us
hicks
even
listen
to
cultured
music
and
such
can
you
say
the
same
aside
from
that
you
shouldnt
try
to
shit
on
this
guy
by
insulting
where
you
think
he
comes
from
where
im
from
we
milk
cows
drive
trucks
and
yes
even
like
baseball
so
screw
anyone
that
doesnt
like
it
oh
yeah
learn
the
difference
between
to
and
too

either
way
there
are
too
many
complications
nobody
said
life
was
easy
pam
is
aware
of
that
to
bad
that
she
has
to
be
judged
by
people
like
you
who
cant
look
past
anatomy
