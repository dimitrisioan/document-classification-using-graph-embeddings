RE
YOUNG
CATCHERS
MSSNETCOMCOM
MARK
SINGER
SAID
IN
ARTICLE
GENETICPITTEDU
DAVID
M
TATE
WRITES
WELL
PERHAPS
IF
THE
BRAVES
HAD
NO
ONE
ELSE
WORTH
PLAYING
THIS
YEAR
IT
WOULD
BE
LOPEZ
IN
THERE
BUT
THEY
DO
HAVE
OTHERS
WORTH
PLAYING
AT
LEAST
IN
THEIR
OPINION
CATCHER
IS
THEIR
WEAKEST
POSITION
WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
EXCEPTION
OF
SECOND
BASE
THEY
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
SIMULTANEOUSLY
REPLACE
THEIR
BIGGEST
OFFENSIVE
PROBLEM
SPOT
WITH
A
WELLABOVEAVERAGE
OFFENSIVE
PLAYER
AND
ACCLIMATE
A
HIGHLY
PROMISING
POTENTIAL
STAR
WITH
NO
PRESSURE
ON
HIM
TO
CARRY
THE
TEAM
AND
THEY
WANT
TO
PLAY
OLSON
AND
BERRYHILL
INSTEAD
I
DISAGREE
IN
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
A
TANGIBLE
SKILL
ANY
MORE
THAN
LEADERSHIP
IS
I
DONT
DENY
THAT
IT
IS
A
REAL
SKILL
AND
THAT
SOME
CATCHERS
MAY
BE
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
OTHERS
AT
IT
BUT
I
REALLY
DONT
SEE
ANY
WAY
THAT
WE
COULD
EVER
KNOW
WHO
THEY
ARE
NICHOLSS
LAW
OF
CATCHER
DEFENSE
IS
EERILY
ACCURATE
FAR
TOO
OFTEN
FOR
ME
TO
TAKE
DEFENSIVE
ASSESSMENTS
OF
CATCHERS
VERY
SERIOUSLY
SORRY
NEW
DONT
KNOW
NICHOLS
LAW
A
CATCHERS
DEFENSIVE
REPUTATION
WILL
BE
INVERSELY
PROPORTIONAL
TO
HIS
RECENT
OFFENSIVE
LEVEL
OF
PERFORMANCE
THUS
MICKEY
TETTLETON
GOES
IN
THE
MEDIA
FROM
BEING
A
NOHIT
DEFENSIVE
WHIZ
TO
A
SLUGGING
THUMBFINGER
IN
TWO
SHORT
YEARS
THE
RULE
DOESNT
APPLY
TO
PERCEIVED
SUPERSTARS
WHO
GET
THE
GOLD
GLOVE
OFFENSIVE
TRANSFER
EFFECT
INSTEAD
GREG
OLSON
IS
PROBABLY
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
A
GOOD
DEFENSIVE
CATCHER
PRECISELY
BECAUSE
HE
CANT
HIT
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
CATCHERS
ERA
BUT
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
PITCHERS
ERAS
WITH
DIFFERENT
CATCHERS
ARENT
THEY
THE
SAME
THING
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WE
KNOW
MORE
THAN
THEY
DO
SO
THE
ONLY
LOGIC
BEHIND
A
DIFFERENT
DECISION
THAN
WE
WOULD
MAKE
MUST
BE
FINANCIAL
EITHER
THAT
OR
JUST
STUPIDITY
I
PRESUME
WE
FEEL
THIS
WAY
ABOUT
OTHER
FRANCHISES
THAN
ATLANTA
NO
OF
COURSE
IS
IT
FAIR
TO
THE
YOUNG
PLAYERS
NO
DOES
IT
MAKE
ORGANIZATIONAL
SENSE
I
THINK
IT
DOES
WELL
IF
IT
DOES
MAKE
ORGANIZATIONAL
SENSE
ONE
CAN
HARDLY
FAULT
THEM
FOR
THEIR
DECISIONS
I
MEAN
PLEASE
DONT
TELL
ME
HOW
TO
RUN
MY
BUSINESS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
IM
BEING
SUCCESSFUL
ONE
COULD
MAKE
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
ARGUMENT
IN
OTHER
CASES
PETE
ROSE
IN
PURSUING
TY
COBBS
RECORD
WAS
A
HUGE
GATE
ATTRACTION
AND
NATIONAL
MEDIA
MAGNET
THE
REDS
MADE
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
OFF
THAT
THEY
ALSO
WASTED
THE
PRIME
OF
ERIC
DAVIS
THAT
MAY
BE
GOOD
BUSINESS
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
I
DONT
LOATHE
THEM
FOR
IT
DAVID
M
TATE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
IS
ABOUT
YOU
THAT
CLOSES
POSING
AS
AND
OPENS
ONLY
SOMETHING
IN
ME
UNDERSTANDS
E
E
CAN
THE
POCKET
OF
YOUR
GLOVE
IS
DEEPER
THAN
PETE
ROSES
DY
CUMMINGS
NOBODY
NOT
EVEN
TIM
RAINES
HAS
SUCH
SOFT
HANDS
