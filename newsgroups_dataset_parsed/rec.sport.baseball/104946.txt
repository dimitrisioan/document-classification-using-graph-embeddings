having
bonds
batting
behind
williams
means
that
matt
will
get
more
good
pitches
to
hit
this
is
important
since
he
struggles
so
much
with
breaking
balls
opposing
pitchers
dont
want
to
walk
williams
to
get
to
bonds
i
have
to
wonder
if
this
good
hitter
behind
you
argument
is
really
valid
has
anyone
done
a
study
on
this

a
study
look
at
matt
williams
the
year
after
mitchell

gone
look
no
further
not
a
scientific
study
but
itll
show
the
truth
for
matt
besides
bonds
wants
to
bat
tim
if
you
want
an
actual
analysis
of
batting
order
look
up
analysis
of
baseball
batting
order
by
monte
carlo
simulation
by
