SANJEEV
PUNJABI
WRITES
AS
THE
HEADING
INDICATES
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
ME
TO
FATHOM
WHY
BARRY
IS
NOT
BATTING
FOR
THE
GIANTS
BEHIND
WILL
CLARK
BARRY
IS
SUCH
AN
AWESOME
AND
CONSISTENT
HITTER
DEFINITELY
THE
BEST
IN
THE
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
IMHO
TO
HAVE
WILLIAMS
A
STREAKY
HITTER
AND
NOT
REALLY
A
CLUTCH
HITTER
BATTING
AHEAD
OF
BONDS
IS
SIMPLY
AN
INJUSTICE
TO
THE
GIANTS
AND
FANS
OF
THE
GIANTS
SIMPLE
REASONS
BATTING
WILLIAMS
AHEAD
OF
BONDS
WILL
CREATE
A
LEFTCLARK
RIGHTWILLIAMS
LEFTBONDS
SITUATION
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
BATTING
ORDER
THIS
MAKES
IT
TOUGHER
FOR
OPPOSING
MANAGER
TO
CHANGE
PITCHERS
HAVING
BONDS
BATTING
BEHIND
WILLIAMS
MEANS
THAT
MATT
WILL
GET
MORE
GOOD
PITCHES
TO
HIT
THIS
IS
IMPORTANT
SINCE
HE
STRUGGLES
SO
MUCH
WITH
BREAKING
BALLS
OPPOSING
PITCHERS
DONT
WANT
TO
WALK
WILLIAMS
TO
GET
TO
BONDS
