i
seem
to
remember
a
fair
amount
of
sympathy
for
some
black
fringe
player
named
roberto
clemente
and
for
roy
campanella
and
for
thurman
munson
and
for
just
about
anyone
else
who
we
may
not
even
have
liked
as
players
but
mourned
for
dying
too
young
wiggins
alan
i
believe
he
was
well
out
of
baseball
by
the
time
he
died
but
thats
besides
the
point
im
sure
people
would
feel
slightly
sympathetic
for
rickey
if
he
were
killed
but
they
would
also
be
criticizing
him
a
lot
more
for
his
actions
example
how
about
jose
canseco
he
gets
a
couple
of
speeding
tickets
and
all
of
the
sudden
his
attitude
is
awful
what
the
hell
do
speeding
tickets
have
to
do
with
clubhouse
influence
anyway
so
why
do
sportswriters
talk
about
it
all
the
time
uh
he
also
has
been
charged
with
chasing
his
wife
in
a
car
and
smashing
it
into
a
tree
as
well
as
carrying
a
loaded
firearm
in
his
car
and
the
speeding
reported
was
over
mph
reckless
driving
or
brian
hunter
and
keith
mitchell
both
of
whom
had
dwi
problems
towards
the
end
of
last
year
two
years
ago
it
was
cited
as
a
sign
of
their
immaturity
etc
actually
i
hadnt
heard
about
this
thanks
meanwhile
dykstra
almost
killed
both
himself
and
daulton
and
i
didnt
read
any
sportswriter
complaining
about
that
they
may
have
talked
about
how
bad
it
was
for
the
phillies
but
i
never
read
anywhere
criticism
of
dykstras
character
or
daultons
intelligence
for
that
matter
based
on
this
incident
i
dont
know
what
you
were
reading
or
watching
but
i
sure
saw
a
lot
about
that
and
about
dykstras
poker
games
most
of
the
writing
was
along
the
lines
of
how
incredibly
stupid
and
selfish
it
was
and
how
hed
hurt
the
team
by
wracking
himself
and
the
catcher
up
etc
espn
raised
questions
about
his
judgement
etc
the
print
media
here
in
the
sf
area
questioned
why
disciplinary
action
wouldnt
be
taken
against
dykstra
and
one
article
pointed
out
that
if
lenny
wanted
to
kill
himself
there
were
ways
that
wouldnt
endanger
other
peoples
lives
then
there
was
dykstra
himself
being
quoted
on
how
stupid
it
was
etc
