IN
SPORTS
RADIO
WIP
IN

LOATHE
THE
PHILLY
SPORTS
TEAMS
THE
PHILLIES
ARE
MY
FAVORITE
NL
TEAM
YANKS
ARE
FAVORITE
AL
AND
THE
EAGLES
ARENT
TOO
BAD
EITHER
THERE
ARE
TWO
BIG
PROBLEMS
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
HOME
TEAMS
ESPECIALLY
THE
EAGLES
UNLIKE
THE
FAN
HOSTS
WHO
CAN
AT
LEAST
ANSWER
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
AN
OUTOFTOWN
TEAM
IF
A
CALLER
ASKS
THE
WIP
HOSTS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
NO
CLUE
ABOUT
ANY
TEAM
THAT
DOESNT
PLAY
ON
BROAD
STREET
ALSO
FANS
PERIODIC
SPORTS
UPDATES
EVERY
MINUTES
GIVES
SPORTS
NEWS
AND
SCORES
FROM
AROUND
THE
COUNTRY
ITS
VERY
RARE
TO
HEAR
AN
OUTOFTOWN
SCORE
BEING
REPORTED
ON
WIP
HOSTS
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
JODY
MACDONALD
WHO
I
MISS
FROM
HIS
DAYS
AT
FAN
NONE
OF
THE
HOSTS
REALLY
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
BOTH
A
BROAD
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
SPORT
OR
A
GOOD
ONAIR
PRESENCE
THE
WORST
IS
GARY
COBB
WHO
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
HIRED
SOLELY
ON
THE
BASIS
THAT
HE
USED
TO
PLAY
FOR
THE
EAGLES
ANYWAY
THATS
MY
TWO
CENTS
ON
THE
WHOLE
FAN
VS
WIP
BATTLE
ALAN
