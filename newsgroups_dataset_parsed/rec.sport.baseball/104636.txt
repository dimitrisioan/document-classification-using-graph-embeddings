that
hed
been
thrown
out
and
gant
had
a
legitimate
beef
about
the
pitch
that
was
called
a
strike
a
reasonable
umpire
would
not
have
tried
to
force
gant
back
into
the
box
in
that
situation
a
reasonable
umpire
would
do
as
hes
been
instructed
to
do
this
season
get
the
batters
back
in
the
box
sooner
to
try
to
cut
down
on
the
ridiculous
length
of
games
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
this
happen
and
hope
more
umpires
will
do
as
hirschbeck
did
in
instructing
the
pitcher
to
pitch
if
the
batter
wont
get
back
in
the
box
so
what
if
the
previous
strike
call
was
bogus
its
in
the
past
it
cant
be
changed
get
back
in
there
and
deal
with
the
next
pitch
sorry
sherri
but
i
cant
agree
with
this
particular
incident
while
im
all
for
cutting
down
the
number
of
chainrattles
and
other
examples
of
rampant
hargroving
there
was
a
difference
here
since
time
immemorial
batters
have
complained
about
calls
so
have
pitchers
and
catchers
usually
nothing
happens
unless
the
league
notified
teams
this
year
about
not
allowing
complaints
hirschbeck
was
acting
against
expectations
its
not
as
if
gant
was
in
hirschbecks
face
gant
said
something
about
the
call
stepped
out
of
the
box
and
turned
away
from
hirschbeck
as
a
hitter
alibet
of
little
consequence
but
with
a
decent
eye
whenever
receiving
the
short
end
of
the
stick
on
a
questionable
call
id
want
a
moment
or
two
out
of
the
box
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
rethink
the
strike
zone
based
on
the
experience
of
the
last
pitch
and
if
i
was
really
angry
at
the
ump
id
rather
turn
away
and
catch
my
breath
than
turn
to
him
and
say
something
that
might
get
me
tossed
especially
at
a
key
moment
in
the
game
when
gant
turned
away
hirschbeck
immediately
motioned
for
gant
to
step
into
the
box
imo
at
this
point
in
time
hirschbeck
was
determined
to
show
gant
exactly
who
was
in
charge
of
this
game
gant
wasnt
dawdling
he
hadnt
had
a
chance
to
dawdle
and
hirschbeck
was
simply
exercising
a
power
play
gant
resisted
as
many
of
us
might
to
what
we
thought
was
an
unreasonable
request
and
hirschbeck
called
for
the
pitch
at
that
point
cox
came
out
on
the
field
the
pitch
was
thrown
and
many
other
braves
left
the
dugout
cox
was
tossed
protecting
his
player
i
was
pleasantly
surprised
that
gant
kept
his
cool
enough
to
stay
in
the
game
its
a
small
sample
size
but
based
on
what
i
saw
in
that
game
mark
hirschbeck
has
a
hairtrigger
temper
and
a
need
to
play
god
on
the
field
not
good
qualities
for
an
umpire
i
will
keep
my
eyes
open
for
future
appearances
of
hirschbeck
in
the
future
in
order
to
improve
my
sample
size
imo
any
game
where
you
remember
the
name
of
the
umpire
was
a
bad
game
for
the
umpire
