WRITES
SINCE
I
DID
SO
WELL
LAST
YEAR
HERES
ANOTHER
SHOT
AT
PICKING
THE
WINNERS
AND
LOSERS
ILL
SKIP
THE
COMMENTARY
ON
WHY
I
PICKED
WHO
TO
FINISH
WHERE
DUE
TO
LACK
OF
TIME
FOR
FLAME
WARS
KANSAS
CITY
I
THINK
KC
HAS
A
MUCH
BETTER
SHOT
AT
BEING
IN
THE
TOP
DIVISION
THAN
THE
BOTTOM
ONE
WORDCONE
SHOULD
HELP
THINGS
TREMENDOUSLY
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
WAY
OFF
THE
MARK
HERE
ANOTHER
WORD
OFFENSE
MAKES
THEM
MY
PICK
FOR
LAST
TOO
WELL
THERES
ALSO
MY
POLICY
OF
NEVER
PICKING
A
BUCK
RODGERS
TEAM
FOR
LAST
FLORIDA
CHICAGO
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
AN
EXPANSION
TEAM
HAS
EVER
FINISHED
NOT
LAST
BUT
I
THINK
THIS
YEAR
MIGHT
BE
A
FIRST
IF
IT
HASNT
EVER
HAPPENED
THE
CUBS
ARE
WORSE
THE
ANGELS
WERE
GAME
OUT
OF
THE
ATHLETICS
AND
EXPANSION
SENATORS
FINISHED
TIED
FOR
LAST
THE
COLT
FINSHED
AHEAD
OF
THE
CUBS
THE
METS
WERE
LAST
THE
ROYALS
FINSHED
AHEAD
OF
THE
WHITE
SOX
THE
PILOTS
IN
LAST
THE
MARINERS
FINISHED
AHEAD
OF
THE
ATHLETICSIN
LAST
APPARENTLY
BEING
AN
EXPANSION
TEAM
WITH
A
POOR
AS
OR
CHICAGO
TEAM
AROUND
IS
A
GOOD
THING
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
WEST
CINCINNATI
HOUSTON
ATLANTA
ARGH
HERE
IS
WHERE
YOU
ARE
OBVIOUSLY
DEAD
WRONG
NOT
SINCE
THE
YANKEES
OF
THE
AND
HAS
A
TEAM
BEEN
SO
NICELY
SETUP
AS
THIS
YEARSAND
YEARS
TO
COME
BRAVES
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THE
ALLSTAR
TEAM
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
BEAT
THIS
MAY
BE
AN
APPROPRIATE
COMPARISON
THE
YANKEES
FINSHED
AND
FINSHING
AND
GAMES
OUT
OF
FIRST
IN
AND
THEY
ALSO
FINISHED
SECOND
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
ONLY
AND
GAMES
OUT
EVEN
GREAT
TEAMS
CAN
LOSE
THATS
WHY
THEY
PLAY
THE
SEASON
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IM
STILL
PICKING
THE
BRAVES
TO
GO
ALL
THE
WAY
