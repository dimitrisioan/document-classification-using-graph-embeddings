id
have
to
say
the
most
impressive
hrs
ive
ever
see
came
from
dave
kingman
and
his
infamous
moonraker
drives
i
remember
one
he
hit
circa
at
wrigley
field
that
went
across
the
street
in
dead
center
field
and
hit
a
house
on
the
roof
he
whiffed
a
lot
but
when
he
did
connect
watch
out
my
favorite
was
the
barry
foote
homer
that
bounced
on
waveland
and
through
a
second
floor
window
across
the
street
second
though
would
be
the
kong
drive
that
was
last
seen
bouncing
down
the
street
that
dead
ends
to
the
park
at
waveland
