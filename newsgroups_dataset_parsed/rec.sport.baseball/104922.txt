HAVE
TO
SAY
THE
MOST
IMPRESSIVE
HRS
IVE
EVER
SEE
CAME
FROM
DAVE
KINGMAN
AND
HIS
INFAMOUS
MOONRAKER
DRIVES
I
REMEMBER
ONE
HE
HIT
CIRCA
AT
WRIGLEY
FIELD
THAT
WENT
ACROSS
THE
STREET
IN
DEAD
CENTER
FIELD
AND
HIT
A
HOUSE
ON
THE
ROOF
HE
WHIFFED
A
LOT
BUT
WHEN
HE
DID
CONNECT
WATCH
OUT
MY
FAVORITE
WAS
THE
BARRY
FOOTE
HOMER
THAT
BOUNCED
ON
WAVELAND
AND
THROUGH
A
SECOND
FLOOR
WINDOW
ACROSS
THE
STREET
SECOND
THOUGH
WOULD
BE
THE
KONG
DRIVE
THAT
WAS
LAST
SEEN
BOUNCING
DOWN
THE
STREET
THAT
DEAD
ENDS
TO
THE
PARK
AT
WAVELAND
