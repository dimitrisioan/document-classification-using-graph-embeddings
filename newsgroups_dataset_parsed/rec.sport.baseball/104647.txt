came
on
the
field
during
sundays
slugfest
when
a
giants
patron
refused
to
throw
an
atlanta
hr
back
the
garbage
started
hitting
the
field
well
before
the
sunday
game
it
started
on
thursday
or
friday
i
cant
recall
which
games
i
didnt
watch
on
tbs
deion
was
getting
pelted
with
trash
the
whole
time
it
seemed
the
announcers
talked
about
the
change
in
the
seating
in
the
bleachers
and
how
that
made
it
easier
for
the
events
that
transpired
i
actually
thought
at
the
start
of
the
sunday
slugfest
that
since
it
was
a
sunday
daygame
the
crowd
would
be
a
little
different
more
refined
surprise
