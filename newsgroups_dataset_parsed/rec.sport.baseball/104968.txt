BOSOX
GO
DOWN
IN
SMOKE
II
SEATTLE
OH
YEA
AND
CHRIS
BOSIO
PITCHED
A
NOHITTER
ONE
OVER
THE
MINIMUM
TWO
BASES
ON
BALL
IN
THE
FIRST
INNING
ONE
RUNNER
LEFT
PITCHES
I
LISTENED
TO
THE
GAME
ON
RADIO
AND
LISTENING
TO
DAVE
NIEHAUS
CALL
THE
GAME
WAS
A
REAL
TREAT
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
KEEP
RON
FAIRLY
QUITE
I
DOUBT
IF
ANYONE
IS
BETTER
THAN
NIEHAUS
BUT
THAT
FAIRLY
GUY
IS
REALLY
ANNOYING
ME
BUT
I
GUESS
IF
CLEMENS
OR
VIOLA
HAD
BEEN
PITCHING
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
TWO
SHUTOUTS
IN
TWO
NIGHTS
AGAINST
THE
HOTTEST
BEST
HITTING
TEAM
IN
MAJOR
LEAGUE
BASEBALL
PRETTY
IMPRESSIVE
IN
ANY
LEAGUE
MAN
IF
JOHNSON
BOSIO
AND
HANSON
KEEP
GOING
THE
MARINERS
COULD
BE
A
REALLY
INTERESTING
TEAM
TO
FOLLOW
THIS
YEAR
ALSO
JOHN
CUMMINGS
ROOKIE
HAS
HAD
THREE
SOLID
OUTINGS
WITH
NO
SUPPORT
IF
FLEMING
COMES
BACK
THIS
MAY
BE
THE
BEST
STARTING
STAFF
IN
THE
AMERICAN
LEAGUE
THIS
YEAR
RELIEF
IS
ANOTHER
STORY
THOUGH
GRIMACE
TOO
COOL
THE
FIRST
NOHITTER
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
FOLLOW
FROM
START
TO
END
AND
AGAIN
I
THINK
NIEHAUS
WILL
WIN
SOME
KIND
OF
AWARD
FOR
THE
WAY
HE
CALLED
THE
GAME
THE
GUY
IS
TRULY
A
JOY
TO
LISTEN
TO
HE
DESERVES
A
PENNANT
RACE
KENT
DIETZ
TWINS
IN
MARINERS
IF
ONLY
THEY
WERE
AN
NL
TEAM
FOLLOW
