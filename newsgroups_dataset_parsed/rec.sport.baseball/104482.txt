mark
singer
says
lasorda
juggled
his
lineup
against
the
pirates
friday
night
and
from
the
results
one
might
conclude
that
he
will
stick
with
the
changes
for
a
while
butler
reclaimed
leadoff
spot
probably
for
the
whole
season
davis
wants
to
get
his
speed
into
play
last
night
piazza
the
kid
is
doing
everything
well
very
well
strawberry
the
primadonna
insists
on
batting
cleanup
how
do
you
know
this
did
lasorda
say
before
the
game
heres
the
lineup
im
using
im
batting
strawman
fourth
because
the
primadonna
insists
on
batting
cleanup
if
this
is
true
note
that
i
dont
think
it
is
lasorda
should
be
fired
for
at
least
two
reasons
publicly
humiliating
his
players
knuckling
under
to
his
players
wishes
however
i
think
that
the
more
likely
explanation
is
that
lasorda
wanted
strawberry
to
bat
fourth
and
that
you
hate
strawberry
