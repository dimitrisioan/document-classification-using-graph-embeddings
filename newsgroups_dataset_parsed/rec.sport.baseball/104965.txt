BOSIOS
NOHITTER
I
WATCHED
THE
FINAL
INNING
OF
BOSIOS
NOHITTER
WITH
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
AT
WORK
AFTER
VIZQUEL
MADE
THAT
BAREHANDED
GRAB
OF
THE
CHOPPER
UP
THE
MIDDLE
SOMEONE
REMARKED
THAT
IF
HE
HAD
FIELDED
IT
WITH
HIS
GLOVE
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
HAD
TIME
TO
THROW
RILES
OUT
YET
THE
THROW
BEAT
RILES
BY
ABOUT
TWO
STEPS
I
WONDER
HOW
MANY
OTHERS
WHO
WATCHED
THE
FINAL
OUT
THINK
VIZQUEL
HAD
NO
CHOICE
BUT
TO
MAKE
THE
PLAY
WITH
HIS
BARE
HAND
DOES
ANYBODY
THINK
VIZQUEL
WAS
WRONG
TO
FIELD
THE
BALL
BAREHANDED
AND
IF
HE
FAILED
TO
FIELD
IT
CLEANLY
WOULD
IT
OR
SHOULD
IT
HAVE
BEEN
AN
ERROR
OR
A
HIT
JUDGING
FROM
BOSIOS
GRIMACE
WHEN
THE
BALL
BOUNCED
PAST
HIM
HE
MUST
HAVE
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
GO
THROUGH
FOR
A
HIT
WHETHER
VIZQUEL
WAS
RIGHT
OR
WRONG
HE
CERTAINLY
MADE
ONE
HELL
OF
A
PLAY
