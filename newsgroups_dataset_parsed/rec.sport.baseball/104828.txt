DALE
STEPHENSON
SAYS
THE
EVENTS
I
SAW
WERE
CALLED
STRIKE
BY
HIRSCHBECK
SHOCKEDLOOKING
GANT
ASKS
FOR
APPEAL
TO
FIRST
NO
APPEAL
TO
FIRST
GANT
STEPS
OUT
OF
BATTERS
BOX
HIRSCHBECK
IMMEDIATELY
ORDERS
GANT
BACK
IN
BAD
MOVE
EVEN
I
NOTICED
THAT
GANTS
DEMEANOR
WAS
NOT
ONE
OF
A
BATTER
ATTEMPTING
TO
REGAIN
HIS
CONCENTRATION
GANT
WAS
STALKING
OFF
I
WONDER
IF
GANT
SAID
SOMETHING
TO
THE
UMP
GANT
IGNORES
HIRSCHBECK
AND
WALKS
OFF
BAD
MOVE
ACTUALLY
THERE
WAS
A
SMALL
HAND
WAVE
BY
GANTAS
IF
TO
SAY
DONT
BOTHER
ME
GANT
MAY
HAVE
SAID
SOMETHING
HERE
TOO
HIRSCHBECK
YELLS
AT
GANT
GANT
IS
SILENT
HIRSCHBECK
CALLS
FOR
THE
PITCH
PITCH
IS
CALLED
A
STRIKE
COX
ARGUES
COULDNT
SEE
WHEN
HE
CAME
ON
THE
FIELD
COX
WAS
ALREADY
HALFWAY
TO
THE
UMP
WHEN
THE
STRIKE
WAS
CALLED
COX
IS
EJECTED
PLAYERS
EVERYWHERE
PLAY
FINALLY
RESUMES
GANT
SHOULDNT
HAVE
IGNORED
HIRSCHBECK
NOT
RETURNING
MADE
THE
STRIKE
CALL
FAIRLY
LIKELY
ALTHOUGH
I
SUSPECT
AN
ARGUMENT
MIGHT
HAVE
GOTTEN
GANT
TOSSED
ALTOGETHER
BUT
IF
HIRSCHBECK
HAD
LET
GANT
STEP
OUT
THE
WHOLE
INCIDENT
PROBABLY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
AVOIDED
MY
IMPRESSION
WAS
THAT
GANT
WAS
NOT
STEPPING
OUT
HE
WAS
MAKING
A
PROTEST
ABOUT
THE
LACK
OF
AN
APPEAL
TO
FIRST
AS
HAS
BEEN
POINTED
OUT
EARLIER
THERE
IS
NO
APPEAL
TO
FIRST
ON
A
STRIKE
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
GANT
FEELING
A
LITTLE
PRESSURE
IN
A
TWOOUT
RISP
GAME
NINTH
INNING
HE
LET
IT
GET
TO
HIM
THE
UMP
ALSO
OVERREACTED
GANT
WAS
STALKING
OFF
BUT
I
DOUBT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
GONE
LONG
HIRSCHBECK
SHOULD
HAVE
LET
HIM
HAVE
A
MOMENT
TO
COMPOSE
HIMSELF
BEFORE
TELLING
HIM
TO
COME
BAT
IMHO
UMPIRES
SHOULD
BE
MORE
FLEXIBLE
THAN
WHAT
HIRSCHBECK
SHOWED
GANT
WAS
DISTURBED
TO
THE
POINT
IT
WAS
PRETTY
LIKELY
HE
WOULD
NOT
GET
A
HIT
A
VERY
BAD
FINISH
TO
A
PRETTY
GOOD
GAME
