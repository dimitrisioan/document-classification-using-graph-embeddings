ALAN
SEPINWALL
WRITES
SOME
PLEASANT
AND
THEN
SOME
NOT
SO
PLEASANT
SURPRISES
ABOUT
THE
EDITION
OF
THE
BRONX
BOMBERS
SO
FAR
A
FRIEND
MADE
A
COMPARISON
BETWEEN
WICKMAN
AND
JACK
MORRIS
THEY
NEVER
HAVE
IMPRESSIVE
STATS
BUT
THEY
ALWAYS
FIND
SOME
WAY
TO
WIN
ALTHOUGH
MORRIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
LOSING
THAT
ABILITY
I
FIGURED
THAT
WICKMAN
WOULD
BE
THE
LEAST
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THE
STEVE
SAX
TRADE
BEST
TRADE
SINCE
WE
GOT
THAT
RUTH
GUY
MAYBE
WINDING
UP
AS
A
GOOD
MIDDLE
RELIEVER
BUT
I
LIKE
WHAT
IVE
SEEN
SO
FAR
HE
DOESNT
PITCH
PRETTY
BUT
HE
GETS
THE
JOB
DONE
ACTUALLY
I
KIND
OF
LIKED
THE
ABOTT
TRADE
WE
DID
TRADE
THE
ROOKIE
OF
THE
YEAR
SNOW
BUT
WITH
DON
MATTINGLY
AT
FIRST
FOR
ANOTHER
YEARS
WHY
BOTHER
