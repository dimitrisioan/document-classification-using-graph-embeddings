some
pleasant
and
then
some
not
so
pleasant
surprises
about
the
edition
of
the
bronx
bombers
so
far
a
friend
made
a
comparison
between
wickman
and
jack
morris
they
never
have
impressive
stats
but
they
always
find
some
way
to
win
although
morris
seems
to
be
losing
that
ability
i
figured
that
wickman
would
be
the
least
important
part
of
the
steve
sax
trade
best
trade
since
we
got
that
ruth
guy
maybe
winding
up
as
a
good
middle
reliever
but
i
like
what
ive
seen
so
far
he
doesnt
pitch
pretty
but
he
gets
the
job
done
actually
i
kind
of
liked
the
abott
trade
we
did
trade
the
rookie
of
the
year
snow
but
with
don
mattingly
at
first
for
another
years
why
bother
