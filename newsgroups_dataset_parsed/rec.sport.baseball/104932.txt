hi
baseball
fans
so
what
do
you
say
dont
you
think
he
deserves
it
i
mean
heck
if
dave
winfield
hohum
is
seriously
being
considered
for
it
as
is
lee
smith
ha
then
why
dont
we
give
dave
kingman
a
chance
or
darrell
evans
yeah
yeah
after
the
hall
of
fame
takes
in
them
it
can
take
in
eddie
murray
and
jeff
reardon
um
what
eddie
murray
was
a
superb
first
baseman
for
a
long
time
winfield
as
produced
consistently
for
almsot
years
and
excellently
on
several
occasions
dave
kingmans
best
year
was
like
darryl
strawberrys
typical
year
with
the
mets
darrell
evans
too
did
a
whole
lot
more
than
just
hit
homers
which
is
all
that
kong
did
well
in
any
case
i
am
sick
and
tired
mostly
sick
of
everybody
giving
hall
of
fame
consideration
to
players
that
are
by
todays
standards
marginal
whom
are
you
talking
about
yes
eddie
murray
is
marginal
but
thats
because
hes
years
old
he
wasnt
marginal
for
a
long
time
honestly
ozzie
smith
and
robin
yount
dont
belong
there
theyre
both
shortstops
that
just
hung
around
for
a
long
time
big
deal
not
smith
has
hung
around
for
a
long
time
and
fielded
the
position
better
than
anyone
else
ever
has
yount
stopped
being
a
shortstop
about
a
decade
ago
in
case
you
hadnt
noticed
one
of
his
two
mvp
awards
was
as
a
centerfielder
lets
be
a
little
more
selective
huh
stop
handing
out
these
honors
so
liberally
save
them
for
the
guys
who
really
deserve
it
face
it
if
like
whom
there
are
many
players
in
the
hall
who
arent
anywhere
near
as
goos
as
the
guys
youre
running
down
something
isnt
done
there
will
be
little
prestige
in
the
hall
of
fame
anymore
when
thats
already
the
case
by
some
standards
but
the
bad
players
in
the
hall
are
all
from
the
and
recent
picks
have
generally
been
excellent
certain
individuals
believe
that
steve
garvey
or
jack
morris
are
potential
candidates
the
absurdity
is
apparent
gee
can
these
guys
even
compare
to
the
more
likely
future
hall
of
famers
like
kirby
puckett
or
nolan
ryan
no
but
who
cares
was
stan
musial
anywhere
near
as
good
as
babe
ruth
not
really
but
he
obviously
belongs
there
the
hall
has
generally
had
about
the
top
of
major
leaguers
as
more
players
come
through
the
game
more
will
be
in
that
top
and
yes
its
pretty
easy
to
argue
that
smith
yount
evans
winfield
etc
are
in
the
top
dave
kingman
on
the
other
hand
was
a
liability
throughout
most
of
his
career
of
course
garvey
hasnt
gotten
a
lot
of
hof
press
so
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
as
for
ryan
is
his
wl
better
than
morris
thats
what
a
lot
of
voters
tend
to
look
at
and
morris
was
awfully
good
for
a
decade
and
doesnt
lead
mlb
history
in
walks
allowed
either
