re
best
homeruns
i
havent
been
following
the
previous
hrs
but
there
are
two
that
i
saw
live
that
would
have
to
be
up
there
up
where
there
rick
mondays
hr
to
bury
the
expos
in
the
nl
championship
in
it
was
hit
off
steve
rogers
who
is
a
rhp
and
primarily
a
starter
why
was
he
used
as
a
reliever
when
the
spos
had
reardon
and
billlee
warming
up
in
the
bullpen
considering
monday
couldnt
touch
lhp
lee
would
have
been
a
safe
bet
he
wasnt
even
doing
any
drugs
at
that
time
or
so
he
told
me
and
around
others
on
a
recent
venture
into
montreal
the
blast
wasnt
the
important
aspect
it
was
the
timing
seventh
game
a
tie
game
and
in
the
top
of
the
the
expos
almost
came
back
though
mike
schmidt
hit
one
that
killed
the
expos
in
so
close
yet
so
far
and
strawberry
killed
a
pitch
on
the
second
day
of
the
season
a
couple
of
years
ago
it
went
off
the
technical
ring
in
the
big
o
it
almost
left
the
stadium
that
was
hit
hard
