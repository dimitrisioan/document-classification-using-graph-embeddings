phil
allen
ill
post
my
guesses
to
some
of
these
and
other
trivia
questions
posted
for
most
career
ks
with
one
team
if
its
not
ryan
perhaps
steve
carlton
no
way
gotta
be
walter
johnson
all
were
with
washington
carlton
spent
too
long
in
st
louis
to
collect
less
than
there
with
the
rangers
hough
was
there
for
a
long
time
id
also
guess
hough
due
to
his
length
of
tenure
though
i
suspect
bobby
witt
wasnt
far
behind
maybe
even
jenkins
snuck
in
close
in
the
saves
departmentmaybe
lee
smithhe
should
have
at
least
a
hundred
with
the
cubbies
maybe
enough
with
either
the
rsox
or
cards
then
maybe
gossagenyy
and
sd
fingers
mil
oak
fingers
had
to
have
achieved
with
either
mil
or
with
sd
so
yes
id
go
with
that
guess
otherwise
i
was
thinking
that
reardon
has
a
better
chance
of
having
with
min
along
with
i
would
think
easily
reaching
with
mon
dont
know
about
the
homerssteals
dept
gotta
be
willie
maysi
am
fairly
sure
he
had
over
steals
in
his
career
in
some
other
articlemets
trivia
it
could
be
tim
leary
in
at
least
the
losing
to
all
teams
maybe
beating
all
of
em
too
probably
seaver
and
koosman
fit
too
hmmmleary
is
a
really
good
point
id
forgotten
about
him
well
if
nothing
else
there
are
plenty
of
exmet
pitchers
in
the
category
of
could
have
lost
to
all
teams
koosman
leary
torrez
ryan
seaver
i
guess
the
best
three
guesses
would
be
leary
ryan
and
either
seaver
or
koosman
thomas
