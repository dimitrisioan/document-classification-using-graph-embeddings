i

i
prefer
to
post
this
question
to
the
net
i
read
somewhere
in
a
long
forgotten
article
that
the
handsignals
used
by
major
league
umps
were
originally
used
to
help
a
deaf
ball
player
by
the
name
of
dummy
urban
myth
true
i
gots
ta
know
dummy
hoy
a
late
baseball
player
was
deaf
in
order
for
him
to
be
able
to
find
out
whether
the
pitch
was
a
ball
or
strike
the
umpires
developed
hand
signals
this
also
helped
to
relieve
the
stress
on
umpires
vocal
cords
so
they
didnt
have
to
shout
strike
or
ball
times
a
game
heard
about
this
one
from
the
only
worthwhile
baseball
book
john
thorn
has
ever
authored
a
century
of
baseball
