THE
WORST
MANAGER

BRIAN
R
LANDMANN
WRITES
JOE
TORRE
HAS
TO
BE
THE
WORST
MANAGER
IN
BASEBALL
FOR
ANYONE
WHO
DIDNT
SEE
SUNDAYS
GAME
WITH
A
RIGHT
HANDER
PITCHING
HE
DECIDES
TO
BENCH
LANKFORM
A
LEFT
HANDED
HITTER
AND
PLAY
JORDAN
AND
GILKEY
BOTH
RIGHT
HANDERS
LATER
IN
THE
NINTH
INNING
WITH
THE
BASES
LOADED
AND
TWO
OUTS
HE
PUTS
LANKFORD
A
HITTER
WITH
POWER
IN
AS
A
PINCH
RUNNER
AND
USES
LUIS
ALICEA
A
HITTER
WITH
NO
POWER
AS
A
PINCH
HITTER
WHAT
THE
HELL
IS
HE
THINKING
FOR
YOUR
INFORMATION
LANKFORD
IS
INJURED
I
THINK
IT
IS
HIS
SHOULDER
OR
RIB
CAGE
SO
HE
COULD
NOT
USE
HIM
AS
A
PINCH
HITTER
EARLIER
IN
THE
GAME
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
ABOUT
ACQUIRING
MARK
WHITEN
HE
COMMENTED
HOW
FORTUNATE
THE
CARDINALS
WERE
TO
GET
WHITEN
AND
THAT
WHITEN
WOULD
BE
A
REGULAR
EVEN
THOUGH
THIS
MEANT
THAT
GILKEY
WOULD
BE
HURT
BUT
TORRE
SAID
HE
LIKED
GILKEY
COMING
OFF
THE
BENCH
GILKEY
HIT
OVER
LAST
YEAR
WHAT
DOES
HE
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
START
THE
GUY
WOULD
BE
STARTING
ON
MOST
EVERY
TEAM
IN
THE
LEAGUE
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
WHITEN
WAS
A
VERY
GOOD
AQUISITION
FOR
THE
CARDS
HE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TOO
MUCH
OFFENSIVE
CAPABILITIES
BUT
HE
IS
AN
AWESOME
DEFENSIVELY
SINCE
WHEN
HAVE
THE
CARDNIALS
ACTUALLY
THOUGHT
OF
OFFENSE
INSTEAD
OF
DEFENSE
I
FORGOT
WHO
ST
LOUIS
GAVE
UP
FOR
HIM
BUT
IT
WAS
NOT
TOO
MUCH
AS
FAR
AS
GILKEY
IS
CONCERNED
HE
IS
A
LEFTFIELDER
AND
SO
IS
BRIAN
JORDAN
WHO
BEAT
HIM
OUT
I
EXPECT
TO
SEE
A
GILKEYJORDAN
PLATOON
IN
LF
FURTHERMORE
IN
SUNDAYS
GAME
WHEN
LANKFORD
WAS
THROWN
OUT
AT
THE
PLATE
THE
REPLAY
SHOWED
BUCKY
DENT
THE
THIRD
BASE
COACH
LOOKING
DOWN
THE
LINE
AND
WAVING
LANKFORD
HOME
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
ON
THIS
ONE
AS
SOON
AS
LARKIN
THREW
THAT
BALL
I
KNEW
THAT
LANKFORD
WAS
A
DEAD
BIRD
BUT
HOW
COULD
DENT
HAVE
KNOWN
THAT
LARKIN
WOULD
MAKE
A
PERFECT
THROW
I
STRONGLY
BELIEVE
THAT
TORRE
IS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
MANAGERS
IN
BASEBALL
DONT
FORGET
THE
OVERACHIEVING
CARDS
OF
THAT
WON
ALL
THOSE
CLOSE
GAMES
AND
WENT
FROM
LAST
PLACE
TO
SECOND
PLACE
ALTHOUGH
THEY
WERE
OVESHADOWED
BY
THE
BRAVES
TWINS
LAST
TO
FIRST
CLIMB
HE
WON
A
DIVISION
TITLE
AND
BARELY
LOST
A
PENNANT
RACE
WHEN
HE
WAS
WITH
THE
BRAVES
WHY
ATLANTA
EVER
EVEN
CONSIDERED
FIRING
HIM
I
WILL
NEVER
UNDERSTAND
WITH
TORRE
AT
THE
CONTROLS
THE
CARDINALS
ARE
HEADING
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
ONE
MORE
THING
ONE
GAME
DOES
NOT
MAKE
A
SEASON
YES
THEY
LOST
TO
THE
REDS
BUT
WITH
THE
SECOND
BEST
PITCHING
STAFF
IN
THE
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
FIRST
IN
THE
EAST
AND
A
PRETTY
GOOD
OFFENSE
THE
REDBIRDS
WILL
WIN
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THEY
LOSE
MAYBE
THIS
IS
THE
YEAR
THAT
THEY
WILL
GO
ALL
THE
WAY
