jackson
is
a
bum
and
i
thought
the
jays
were
smart
to
get
rid
of
gruber
now
we
get
equally
bad
im
frustrated
pat
gillick
is
over
rated
sure
he
did
some
good
moves
in
the
past
but
releasing
wells
although
his
temper
sucks
but
hes
better
than
morrisstewartdayley
if
the
jays
were
dumping
salaries
to
keep
jackson
dayley
should
be
the
one
to
go
before
wells
of
course
they
dumped
dayley
but
its
too
late
since
dayleys
salary
was
guarenteedwith
wells
the
jays
were
only
on
the
hook
for
of
it
give
jackson
a
breakhe
lost
about
pounds
with
that
flu
he
had
when
he
was
traded
wells
was
already
claimed
by
the
tigers
era
with
wins
also
the
jimmy
key
and
winfield
situations
pissed
the
hell
outta
me
would
you
see
a
championship
club
wanting
to
repeat
so
badly
wanted
to
have
such
a
i
would
rather
have
molitor
than
winfieldwinfield
was
just
hogging
all
the
credit
and
he
was
trying
to
soak
the
jays
for
a
year
guarenteed
contract
great
turnover
no
way
look
at
the
pittsburg
penguins
they
got
some
aging
players
but
didnt
make
stupid
trades
to
dump
them
cuz
the
fans
love
those
players
and
they
are
still
the
core
of
the
team
anyways
i
just
want
to
say
that
if
the
jays
go
below
this
season
i
wont
be
surprised
im
not
jumping
off
the
bandwagon
im
just
talking
smart
baseball
no
matter
what
im
still
going
to
see
most
of
the
jays
games
even
though
im
damn
frustrated
the
jays
pitching
can
only
get
bettermolitor
and
alomar
havent
hit
anything
yetand
the
jays
are
still
over
gerald
