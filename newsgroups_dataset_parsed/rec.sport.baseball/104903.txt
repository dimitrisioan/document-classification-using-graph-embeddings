I
HAD
MY
FIRST
UP
CLOSE
AND
PERSONAL
LAST
NIGHT
AT
THE
STICK
AFTER
WATCHING
GIANTS
HITTERS
STRUGGLE
LAST
YEAR
BARRYS
SWING
WAS
VERY
IMPRESSIVE
HES
VERY
QUICK
AND
HIS
SWING
SEEMS
EFFORTLESS
EVEN
COMPARED
TO
CLARK
PARTICULARLY
CLARK
AS
OF
LATE
IT
WAS
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
BONDS
HIT
MADDUX
SO
WELL
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
BARRY
WAS
AFTER
REVENGE
AGAINST
THE
BRAVES
OR
WHAT
BUT
HE
STROKED
THREE
VERY
PRETTY
HITS
HR
FOR
RBIS
THE
GIANTS
AS
A
TEAM
ARE
DOING
A
LOT
OF
SURPRISING
THINGS
THIS
YEAR
IN
ADDITION
TO
BONDS
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
GOOD
PITCHING
AND
SOME
HITTERS
SEEM
TO
BE
SWINGING
MUCH
BETTER
CLAYTONS
DEFENSE
HAS
BEEN
SUPERB
MCGEE

LIKE
LEADING
OFF
THIS
YEAR
MANWARING

DRIVING
THE
BALL
SO
ON
SO
FORTH
I
HOPE
IT
CONTINUESI
THINK
THEY
NEED
TO
CONTINUE
WELL
INTO
JUNE
BEFORE
PEOPLE
ARE
REALLY
SOLD
THAT
THEY
ARE
FOR
REALPARTICULARLY
THE
PITCHING
FOR
MYSELF
I
THINK
THE
FRESH
START
OF
MAGOWANBAKERETC
HAS
REALLY
WIPED
OUT
A
LOT
OF
NEGATIVES
FROM
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
AND
WILL
BE
A
REAL
FACTOR
IN
HELPING
