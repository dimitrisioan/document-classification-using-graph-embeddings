PHILLIES
A
NEW
BALLPARK
IN
FUTURE
FROM
IAN
M
DERBY
ATTN
THOSE
WHO
LIVE
INTHE
PHILADELPHIA
METRO
AREA
BACK
IN
SEPTEMBER
I
WAS
LISTENING
TO
WIP
AND
I
REMEMBER
THE
MORNING
GUYS
WERE
TALKING
WITH
MAYOR
ED
RENDELL
THE
TOPIC
OF
CONVERSATION
WAS
A
NEW
BALL
PARK
FOR
THE
PHILLIES
THE
LOCATION
FOR
THIS
NEW
PARK
WAS
SUGGESTED
TO
BE
NEAR
ST
STATION
AT
THE
TIME
THE
MAYOR
WAS
OPTIMISITIC
THAT
IN
THE
FUTURE
THIS
COULD
BECOME
A
REALITY
HAS
THERE
BEEN
ANY
NEW
NEWS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
OR
IS
IT
STILL
A
PIPE
DREAM
I
KNOW
THE
CITY
OF
PHILADELPHIA
HAS
OTHER
PROJECTS
AHEAD
SUCH
AS
THE
NEW
CONVENTION
CENTER
AND
THE
UPCOMING
SPECTRUM
II
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
SEE
THIS
A
REALITY
IT
IS
PLANNED
THAT
THE
PHILLIES
LEAVE
THE
VET
AND
LEAVE
IT
SOLELY
TO
THE
EAGLES
AND
IF
THATS
THE
CASE
THE
EAGLES
SHOULD
MAKE
THE
VET
A
GRASS
STADIUM
BUT
THATS
ANOTHER
STORY
I
WANT
TO
SEE
THAT
DAY
