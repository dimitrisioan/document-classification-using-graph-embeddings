SANJEEV
PUNJABI
WRITES
AS
THE
HEADING
INDICATES
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
ME
TO
FATHOM
WHY
BARRY
IS
NOT
BATTING
FOR
THE
GIANTS
BEHIND
WILL
CLARK
BARRY
IS
SUCH
AN
AWESOME
AND
CONSISTENT
HITTER
DEFINITELY
THE
BEST
IN
THE
NATIONAL
LEAGUE
IMHO
TO
HAVE
WILLIAMS
A
STREAKY
HITTER
AND
NOT
REALLY
A
CLUTCH
HITTER
BATTING
AHEAD
OF
BONDS
IS
SIMPLY
AN
INJUSTICE
TO
THE
GIANTS
AND
FANS
OF
THE
GIANTS
SIMPLE
REASONS
BATTING
WILLIAMS
AHEAD
OF
BONDS
WILL
CREATE
A
LEFTCLARK
RIGHTWILLIAMS
LEFTBONDS
SITUATION
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
BATTING
ORDER
THIS
MAKES
IT
TOUGHER
FOR
OPPOSING
MANAGER
TO
CHANGE
PITCHERS
HAVING
BONDS
BATTING
BEHIND
WILLIAMS
MEANS
THAT
MATT
WILL
GET
MORE
GOOD
PITCHES
TO
HIT
THIS
IS
IMPORTANT
SINCE
HE
STRUGGLES
SO
MUCH
WITH
BREAKING
BALLS
OPPOSING
PITCHERS
DONT
WANT
TO
WALK
WILLIAMS
TO
GET
TO
BONDS
BOTH
YOUR
REASONS
ARE
NOT
GOOD
ONES
JOE
MORGAN
THINKS
THAT
BONDSCLARK
WILLIAMS
SHOULD
BE
THE
HITTERS
WHILE
HE
BELIEVES
THAT
CLARKBONDS
WILLIAMS
IS
FINE
HE
DEFINITELY
IS
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
BONDS
SHOULD
HIT
AHEAD
OF
WILLIAMS
I
AM
INCLINED
TO
AGREE
WITH
HIM
YOUR
FIRST
REASON
IS
NOT
VALID
BECAUSE
BONDS
CAN
HIT
BOTH
LEFTIES
AND
RIGHTIES
VERY
WELL
HE
HITS
LEFTIES
OR
RIGHTIES
BETTER
THAN
ANY
OTHER
GIANT
WILLIAMS
IS
STILL
GETTING
BREAKING
BALLS
ALTHOUGH
NOT
AS
MUCH
AS
LAST
SEASON
BUT
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
BONDS
IS
A
FAR
MORE
DISCIPLINED
AND
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
HITTER
THAN
WILLIAMS
AND
I
PREFER
TO
TAKE
MY
CHANCES
WITH
BONDS
DRIVING
IN
THE
OR
HITTERS
WHO
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
HAVE
HIGH
OBPS
THAN
WITH
WILLIAMS
WILLIAMS
WOULD
GET
MORE
FASTBALLS
WITH
BONDS
ON
FIRST
AND
SECOND
BASE
OPEN
BECAUSE
OF
THE
THREAT
OF
BONDS
STEALING
