M
TATE
WRITES
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
CLAIMING
AS
SOME
DO
THAT
GALARRAGAS
INABILITY
TO
DEFER
GRATIFICATION
ISNT
HURTING
HIS
TEAM
BECAUSE
HE
ISNT
PAID
TO
WALK
OR
IS
AN
RBI
GUY
OR
WHATEVER
ALRIGHT
THATS
ENOUGH
IVE
SUFFERED
WITH
ALL
KINDS
OF
INSULTS
AS
TYPICAL
FOR
THE
NET
BUT
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
GALARRAGA
IS
CURRENTLY
BATTING
OVER
AND
YOU
GUYS
ARE
COMPLAINING
THAT
HE
ISNT
DRAWING
ENOUGH
WALKS
WHAT
WOULD
HE
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
PLEASE
YOU
GUYS
BAT
YOU
CAN
HARDLY
CLAIM
THAT
HE
IS
HURTING
HIS
TEAM
IF
IT
HAPPENS
THAT
THE
PITCHERS
START
THROWING
HIM
FEWER
GOOD
PITCHES
AND
HE
STARTS
MAKING
LOTS
OF
OUTS
AS
SOMEONE
SPECULATED
MIGHT
HAPPEN
THEN
I
WOULD
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
HE
ISNT
TAKING
ENOUGH
PITCHES
MY
COMMENT
THAT
HE
ISNT
PAID
TO
WALK
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
A
LICENSE
TO
SWING
AT
BAD
PITCHES
AND
MAKE
OUTS
ITS
MORE
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
HES
BATTING
AND
LEADING
THE
LEAGUE
IN
RBIS
SO
WHAT
BLOODY
DIFFERENCE
DOES
IT
MAKE
IF
HE
ISNT
DRAWING
A
LOT
OF
WALKS
