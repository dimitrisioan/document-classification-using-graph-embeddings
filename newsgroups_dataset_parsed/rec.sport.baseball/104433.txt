TIGERS
POUND
MARINERS
WERE
THEY
PALYING
FOOTBALL
OR
BASEBALL
IN
DETROIT
ON
SATURDAY
FROM
LOOKING
AT
THE
SCHOOL
SOME
PEOPLE
MAY
THINK
IT
WAS
FOOTBALL
BETWEEN
TWO
GAMES
THIS
WEEK
THE
TIGERS
SCORED
RUNS
THE
OFFENSE
CAN
CARRY
THEM
I
HOPE
THE
PITCHING
WILL
HOLD
OUT
I
WAS
AT
CAMDEN
YARDS
YESTERDAY
EVERYTIME
I
LOOKED
UP
THE
SCORE
WAS
GETTING
HIGHER
WHAT
A
GREAT
SITE
IT
WAS
TO
SEE
THE
TIGERS
KICKING
BUTT
WHILE
ENJOYING
A
GAME
AT
CAMDEN
YARDS
GO
TIGERS
AND
GO
