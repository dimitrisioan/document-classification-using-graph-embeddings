re
phillies
a
new
ballpark
in
future
in
a
philadelphia
inquirer
a
few
days
ago
it
was
reported
that
there
were
two
plans
for
a
new
phillies
stadium
the
alreadymentioned
street
station
proposal
and
a
location
near
broad
street
and
race
street
i
think
i
cant
remember
the
exact
details
but
the
stadium
would
be
build
practically
downtown
there
is
a
small
lot
that
could
be
used
according
to
the
paper
the
street
plan
has
run
into
some
trouble
because
amtrak
does
not
want
to
reroute
some
of
its
lines
in
order
to
accomodate
the
stadium
i
dont
have
an
opinion
just
yet
just
letting
everyone
know
that
there
are
really
two
options
being
discussed
right
now
neither
of
these
plans
will
be
put
into
effect
very
soon
however
because
nobody
wants
to
pay
for
it
keith
keller
lets
go
rangers
lets
go
quakers

it
to
you
