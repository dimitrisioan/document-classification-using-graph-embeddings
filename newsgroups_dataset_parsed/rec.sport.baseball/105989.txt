WRITES
THE
BABE
AND
THE
PRIDE
OF
THE
YANKEES
OFFER
VERY
DIFFERENT
RENDITIONS
OF
THE
SOTRY
ABOUT
RUTH
AND
GHERIG
HITTING
HOME
RUNS
FOR
THE
BOY
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
CAN
SOME
HISTORIAN
OUT
THERE
EXPLAIN
HISTORYS
VERSION
OF
THE
STORY
I
WOULDNT
PUT
IS
PAST
EITHER
OR
BOTH
OF
THE
MOVIES
TO
SEASON
THE
TRUTH
WITH
A
LITTLE
EXTRA
SPICE
ANY
OTHER
COMMENTS
AS
TO
INACCURACIES
IN
THESE
TWO
MOVIES
GOOD
QUESTION
I
KIND
OF
WONDERED
ABOUT
THIS
MYSELF
JUST
ONE
THOUGHT
I
HAD
ON
IT
THE
BABE
HIMSELF
WAS
IN
PRIDE
OF
THE
YANKEES
WHICH
MADE
ME
THINK
A
THAT
VERSION
MAY
BE
CLOSER
TO
THE
TRUTH
AND
B
THE
BABE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
A
PRETTY
GOOD
GUT
TO
BE
IN
THE
MOVIE
EVEN
THOUGH
SOME
OF
THE
SCENES
DIDNT
MAKE
HIM
LOOK
COMPLETELY
FLATTERING
