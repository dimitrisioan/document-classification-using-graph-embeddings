WRITES
GAETTI
GARY
APOLOGIES
IF
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
BUT
AS
A
TWINS
FAN
I
LIKE
TO
THINK
THEY
HAVE
GOOD
PLAYERS
IN
ANY
PARK
NOT
SURE
IF
I
REMEMBER
COMPLETELY
OR
NOT
BUT
I
THINK
GAETTI
PLAYED
WITH
THE
TWINS
IN
FOR
THE
WORLD
SERIES
AND
AGAIN
IN
NOTE
THATS
HIS
LOWEST
OF
THE
I
BELIEVE
THE
NEXT
OR
AT
LEAST
THE
LAST
TWO
WERE
PLAYED
WITH
THE
ANGELS
LOTS
OF
FACTORS
MAKE
A
PLAYER
EXCELL
I
HATE
IT
WHEN
SO
MANY
USE
THE
DOME
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
IDEAL
BUT
NICE
TO
COMFORTABLY
ENJOY
BASEBALL
AND
FOOTBALL
EVEN
WHEN
ITS
SNOWING
AND
RAINING
CRAIG
IM
SURE
THE
COMPANY
FOR
WHICH
I
WORK
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ALL
THE
SAME
OPINIONS
THAT
I
DO
THE
EVENT
THAT
HAD
THE
MOST
IMPACT
ON
GAETTIS
CAREER
WAS
HIS
LEG
INJURY
IN
HIS
PERFORMANCE
DROPPED
RADICALLY
FROM
TO
HE
WAS
STILL
WITH
THE
TWINS
IN
AND
BUT
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
HIS
STATS
BOTH
OFFENSIVE
AND
DEFENSIVE
HE
NEVER
HAS
COME
BACK
TO
HIS
PREINJURY
LEVEL
