THIS
CERTAINLY
PASSES
THE
COMMON
SENSE
TEST
FOR
ME
BUT
IS
THERE
ANY
STATISTICAL
EVIDENCE
TO
SAY
WHAT
PERCENT
OF
DEFENSE
IS
PITCHING
AND
WHAT
PERCENT
IS
FIELDING
NOT
YET
I
WISH
THERE
WERE
ITS
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
TEASE
THESE
APART
THAN
TO
TEASE
APART
SCORING
RUNS
AND
PREVENTING
RUNS
AND
THUS
WE
COME
TO
ONE
OF
THE
TRUE
BEAUTIES
OF
BASEBALL
THESE
THINGS
ALONG
WITH
MANY
OTHERS
WILL
NEVER
BE
SEPARATED
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
IN
BASEBALL
IS
SITUATIONAL
AND
INTERDEPENDENT
THIS
IS
WHAT
ALLOWS
US
TO
CARRY
ON
ALL
THE
ARGUMENTS
THAT
WE
HAVE
IF
EVERYTHING
COULD
BE
EXPLAINED
AND
BALANCED
ON
A
STATISTICAL
BASIS
NONE
OF
THE
WONDER
AND
MYSTERY
WOULD
BE
LEFT
WHY
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
RESORT
TO
JUST
GOING
OUT
THE
BALLYARD
AND
ENJOY
THE
GAME
