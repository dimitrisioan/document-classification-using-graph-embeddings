in
article
writes
everytime
i
have
written
on
the
net
about
the
possibility
of
a
successfuls
season
by
the
philadelphia
phillies
i
have
gotten
ripped
from
everybody
from
pittsburgh
to
calcutta
but
if
all
the
ignoramouses
care
to
look
at
this
weeks
baseball
weekly
they
will
see
that
im
not
the
only
one
who
considers
then
as
division
winners
the
rest
of
the
most
respected
baseball
writers
in
the
country
do
as
well
and
what
was
the
reasoning
of
this
genius
writer
that
even
though
their
pitching
is
at
best
sound
they
will
win
on
the
strength
of
their
offense
lesse
offense
offense
thompson
incaviglia
offense
wins
division
winners
at
least
wins
so
wins
wins
thompson
incaviglia
therefore
wins
thompson
incaviglia
what
did
you
learn
in
school
today
if
you
take
a
math
course
and
your
teacher
turns
out
to
be
rob
rains
run
dont
walk
to
dropadd
p
tierney
you
obviously
dont
know
what
the
hell
youre
talking
about
no
thompson
and
incaviglia
dont
equal
wins
but
ill
take
the
two
of
them
over
stan
javier
and
ruben
amaro
ab
id
say
this
improvement
should
equate
to
wins
at
least
then
ill
take
lenny
dykstra
who
played
games
last
year
and
project
his
numbers
hits
hr
sb
over
games
hits
sb
okay
now
well
put
these
numbers
in
the
leadoff
hole
and
thus
i
have
to
bump
kruk
hollins
daulton
rbi
numbers
up
just
a
tad
now
lesse
they
knocked
in
and
respectively
dont
you
think
its
fair
to
add
about
or
rbi
to
each
they
managed
to
knock
in
a
pretty
nice
amount
of
runs
with
a
leadoff
hitter
okay
bozo
do
you
think
its
fair
to
add
maybe
or
more
wins
now
oh
and
how
can
i
forget
wes
chamberlain
abs
hr
rbi
even
with
a
month
and
in
aaa
and
a
horrible
first
half
well
project
that
over
a
full
season
to
get
hr
and
rbi
or
so
is
that
worth
a
win
or
two
finally
take
the
worse
pitching
staff
in
the
nl
last
year
add
the
worse
injury
decimation
of
okay
now
we
add
danny
jackson
some
health
and
a
full
season
for
schilling
is
that
worth
at
least
wins
okay
weve
been
conservative
and
added
about
wins
so
far
now
were
adding
about
more
wins
thanks
to
the
expansion
teams
okay
thats
wins
lesse
dipshit
math
genuious
hmmm
i
think
thats
good
enough
to
win
the
worse
division
in
baseball
next
time
before
you
say
something
foolish
get
a
clue
first
actually
i
was
simply
relaying
the
reasoning
of
this
socalled
genius
bw
writer
i
agree
the
reasoning
was
foolish
next
time
before
you
say
something
foolish
be
aware
what
you
are
responding
to
btw
wins
very
funny
