wrote
to
all
at
ap
recently
i
heard
the
red
sox
on
wrol
a
ap
spanishspeaking
radio
station
i
thought
it
was
so
ap
unreal
the
red
sox
in
spanish
anyway
i
want
to
find
ap
out
how
widespread
this
is
being
a
ny
native
i
know
ap
the
scmets
are
on
in
spanish
but
not
the
yankmes
i
ap
wuold
think
that
lasdtexas
and
fla
are
on
in
spanish
ap
are
there
any
spanishspeaking
networks
or
is
this
a
ap
local
for
the
last
couple
of
years
the
braves
have
been
fostering
a
program
to
reach
to
the
latin
american
audience
this
has
included
licensing
spanish
fan
magazines
encouraging
spanish
cobroadcasts
and
marketing
programs
directed
at
the
latin
american
community
one
of
the
biggest
heros
to
the
latin
american
audience
has
been
francisco
cabrerra
a
fact
of
which
he
was
slightly
embarrassed
one
funny
story
is
that
during
spring
training
the
braves
played
a
game
in
mexico
this
game
was
broadcast
back
to
atlanta
in
spanish
it
took
the
broadcasters
a
few
innings
to
get
a
rythm
going
because
they
had
to
keep
changing
their
location
seems
it
took
a
while
to
find
a
place
where
they
could
get
a
clear
signal
on
their
cellular
phones
through
which
they
were
calling
the
game
