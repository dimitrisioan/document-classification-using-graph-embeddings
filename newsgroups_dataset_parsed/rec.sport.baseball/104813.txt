SAYS
DJ
WAS
A
POPULAR
PLAYER
IN
SAN
DIEGO
DEREK
BELL
WAS
NOT
FARING
WELL
IN
THE
CLUBHOUSE
AT
TORONTO
SO
NO
MATTER
HOW
BAD
HE
LOOKS
NOW
I
STILL
THINK
IT
WAS
A
STEAL
FOR
THE
JAYS
JUST
FROM
THE
PERSPECTIVE
OF
TEAM
CHEMISTRY
I
LAUGH
AT
YOU
NOW
AND
I
WILL
LAUGH
AT
YOU
AGAIN
EQUALLY
PUBLICLY
WHEN
THE
JAYS
FINISH
THIRD
DUE
TO
THE
SEVERE
DEPLETION
OF
THEIR
TALENT
THE
JAYS
WILL
FINISH
THIRD
BECAUSE
OF
THE
DEPLETION
OF
THEIR
PITCHING
STAFF
NOT
BECAUSE
DEREK
BELL
WAS
TRADED
FOR
DARRIN
JAKSON
I
COULDNT
AGREE
MORE
THE
JAYS
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
POWER
IN
THEIR
LINEUP
SO
FAR
PITCHING
HAS
BEEN
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEM
MAYBE
WE
CAN
GET
ACKER
BACK
BUT
ANYWAY
THE
POINT
OF
MY
POST
IF
YOU
MISSED
IT
WAS
THAT
DEREK
BELL
WAS
TRADED
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
BASICALLY
IN
THE
DOGHOUSE
WITH
CITO
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
TEAM
ONE
INCIDENT
THAT
STICKS
OUT
IN
MY
MIND
WAS
WHEN
DEREK
BELL
RAN
BACK
OUT
ON
TO
THE
FEILD
AFTER
THE
JAYS
HAD
WON
THE
DIVISION
AND
ALL
THE
PLAYERS
WERE
BACK
IN
THE
CLUBHOUSE
BELL
RAN
AROUND
THE
FIELD
WITH
HIS
ARMS
IN
THE
AIR
WAVING
A
BIG
TOWEL
OVER
HIS
HEAD
HE
LOOKED
LIKE
A
BIG
JERK
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
YOU
CONSIDER
HE
DID
NOT
CONTRIBUTE
MUCH
TO
THE
TEAM
OVER
THE
WHOLE
SEASON
THE
NEXT
DAY
WINFIELD
AND
CARTER
SOMEHOW
GOT
THE
KEYS
TO
BELLS
JEEP
AND
BROUGHT
IT
OUT
ON
TO
THE
FEILD
BEFORE
THE
GAME
STARTED
THE
STADIUM
ANNOUNCER
SAID
THAT
THERE
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
A
DRAW
LATER
IN
THE
GAME
FOR
BELLS
JEEP
BELL
REALLY
FREAKED
OUT
I
DONT
THINK
BELL
WAS
TO
POPULAR
AFTER
THAT
I
THINK
THAT
JACKSON
MIGHT
BE
TRYING
A
LITTLE
TOO
HARD
RIGHT
NOW
HES
KNOWN
FOR
BEING
A
GREAT
OUTFIELDER
AND
HES
NOT
THE
ONLY
BLUE
JAY
WHO
HAS
BEEN
BOOTING
BALLS
AND
PLAYING
GENERALLY
AWFUL
