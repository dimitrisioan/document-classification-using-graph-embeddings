the
worst
manager
said
nohal
mcrae
is
the
worst
manager
in
baseball
ive
never
seen
a
guy
who
can
waste
talent
like
he
can
one
of
the
best
rawtalent
staffs
in
the
league
and
hes
still
finding
a
way
to
lose
ill
be
surprised
if
he
makes
it
through
the
next
weeks
unless
drastic
improvement
is
made
im
confused
how
is
it
hal
mcraes
fault
that
he
cant
win
with
a
team
whose
best
offensive
player
is
phil
hiatt
i
mean
lets
be
real
kansas
city
will
have
to
get
outstanding
years
from
their
entire
staff
just
to
end
up
near
they
have
less
offense
than
any
other
team
in
baseball
even
if
you
count
the
expansion
teams
