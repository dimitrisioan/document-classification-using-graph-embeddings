RBI
RISP
AND
SLG
OFF
AND
ON
OVER
THE
LAST
SEVERAL
MONTHS
THREADS
ABOUT
RBIS
AND
RELATED
TOPICS
HAVE
GOTTEN
ME
TO
THINKING
ABOUT
HOW
WELL
WE
CAN
PREDICT
A
PLAYERS
RBIS
USING
INFORMATION
ABOUT
HIS
OVERALL
PERFORMANCE
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
RUNNERS
IN
SCORING
POSITION
RISP
THAT
HE
BATS
WITH
IN
THE
MODEL
BILL
JAMES
CALCULATED
PREDICTED
RBIS
AS
BASES
HOME
RUNS
THIS
COMPLETELY
IGNORES
THE
CONTEXT
WHICH
WAS
ALL
THAT
COULD
DO
SINCE
CONTEXT
WAS
UNKNOWN
TO
IT
SO
I
THOUGHT
ID
TAKE
THAT
IDEA
AS
A
STARTING
POINT
AND
LOOK
HOW
GOOD
A
FIT
TO
THE
DATA
YOU
GET
BY
COMPARING
RBIHOME
RUNS
TO
SLGRISP
IVE
STARTED
WITH
TEAM
DATA
USING
DATA
FROM
THE
ELIASS
THAT
IVE
PICKED
UP
OVER
THE
YEARS
WHEN
A
I
COULD
AFFORD
THEM
AND
B
I
COULD
STOMACH
THE
THOUGHT
OF
INCREASING
ELIASS
PROFITS
THAT
GAVE
ME
THE
YEARS
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
TEAM
RBIS
FOR
OR
I
COULD
ADD
THAT
YEAR
IF
YOU
RUN
A
SIMPLE
LEAST
SQUARES
FIT
TO
THE
DATA
YOU
GET
RBIHOME
RUNS
THE
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
THE
LHS
AND
THE
RHS
IS
WHICH
IS
SIGNIFICANT
AT
A
RIDICULOUSLY
HIGH
LEVEL
SO
I
FEEL
LIKE
THE
FIT
IS
GOOD
AT
THE
TEAM
LEVEL
IVE
NO
STARTED
TO
MOVE
ON
TO
THE
PLAYER
LEVEL
AND
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
PLAYERS
WILL
CLARK
OZZIE
SMITH
JOE
CARTER
AND
DON
MATTINGLY
I
HOPE
TO
ADD
QUITE
A
FEW
MORE
DURING
MY
COPIOUS
FREE
TIME
THIS
YEAR
IT
DOESNT
DO
TOO
BADLY
EXCEPT
THE
EQUATION
UNDERPREDICTS
THE
LOW
HR
HITTER
SMITH
WHICH
MAY
BE
A
FAULT
OF
THE
MODEL
OR
IT
COULD
JUST
BE
OZZIE
THE
RESULTS
RBIHR
YEARS
ACTUAL
PREDICTED
CARTER
CLARK
MATTLY
SMITH
I
THINK
WE
CAN
MAKE
A
CASE
AND
I
HOPE
TO
MAKE
IT
STRONGER
THAT
RBIS
CAN
BE
PREDICTED
SIMPLY
FROM
KNOWING
HOW
A
PLAYER
SLUGS
OVERALL
AND
HOW
MANY
MEN
ARE
IN
SCORING
POSITION
WHEN
HE
COMES
