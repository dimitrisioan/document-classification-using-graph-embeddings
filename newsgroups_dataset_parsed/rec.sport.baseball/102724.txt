RE
YOUNG
CATCHERS
MSSNETCOMCOM
MARK
SINGER
SAID
MOST
CATCHERS
NEED
TO
BE
SOLID
DEFENSIVELY
PLAYERS
TO
HELP
THEIR
CLUBS
IN
THE
BIGS
THOSE
ARE
THE
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
LOPEZ
FOR
THE
BRAVES
FOR
THIS
YEAR
NOW
THE
BRAVES
HAVE
TWO
CATCHERS
WHO
HAVE
DEMONSTRATED
SOLID
ABILITIES
TO
CALL
GAMES
TO
WORK
WITH
THE
PITCHERS
TO
THROW
OUT
RUNNERS
THIS
IS
THE
CRUX
OF
THE
ARGUMENT
TO
ME
AT
LEAST
BOTH
THE
SDCN
AND
THE
NONSDCN
CAMPS
SEEM
TO
AGREE
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
A
CATCHERS
DEFENSE
IS
BASICALLY
NONMEASURABLE
AT
PRESENT
YOU
CAN
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
IMPORTANT
CALLING
A
GAME
IS
OR
FRAMING
THE
PITCHES
OR
BLOCKING
BALLS
IN
THE
DIRT
BUT
THERE
IS
LITTLE
OR
NO
WAY
TO
TELL
EXACTLY
HOW
VARIOUS
CATCHERS
RANK
IN
DEFENSE
LOOKING
AT
LOPEZ
SPECIFICALLY
IS
THERE
ANY
REASON
TO
SUSPECT
THAT
HE
IS
A
BAD
DEFENSIVE
CATCHER
OTHER
THEN
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
BRAVES
OR
THE
MEDIA
HAS
LABELED
HIM
A
BAD
DEFENSIVE
CATCHER
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
ANY
PARTICULAR
PROBLEM
IN
HIS
MECHANICS
SUCH
AS
SASSER
HE
MIGHT
BE
A
LITTLE
ROUGH
AROUND
THE
EDGES
IN
BLOCKING
THE
BALL
OR
FRAMING
THE
PITCH
TO
GET
A
GOOD
CALL
BUT
ALL
HE
NEEDS
TO
CLEAR
THAT
UP
IS
PLAYING
AND
PRACTICE
TIME
I
CANT
SEE
HOW
REPETITIONS
AT
AAA
ARE
ANY
BETTER
THEN
REPS
IN
THE
MAJORS
ALL
WERE
LEFT
WITH
IS
THE
CALLING
THE
GAME
ASPECT
OLSEN
AND
BERRYHILL
AT
ALWAYS
GIVEN
CREDIT
FOR
CALLING
GOOD
GAMES
AND
HELPING
THE
PITCHERING
STAFF
BUT
THIS
IS
A
REPUTATION
THAT
IS
GIVEN
TO
ALMOST
ALL
VETERAN
CATCHERS
HOW
IS
CATCHING
AT
AAA
GOING
TO
HELP
LOPEZ
LEARN
THE
MAJOR
LEAGUE
PITCHING
STAFF
THE
ONLY
WAY
ANY
CATCHER
IS
GOING
TO
LEARN
TOM
GLAVINES
PITCHES
IS
TO
CATCH
TOM
GLAVINE
SIMILARLY
I
WOULDNT
BE
SUPPRISED
IF
THE
PITCHERS
CLAIMED
TO
PREFER
PITCHING
TO
OLSEN
OVER
PITCHING
TO
LOPEZ
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
USED
TO
PITCHING
TO
OLSEN
BUT
GIVEN
TIME
THEY
WILL
SAY
THEY
ARE
COMFORTABLE
WITH
LOPEZ
NOW
SINCE
LOPEZ
CANT
LEARN
HOW
TO
HANDLE
THE
MAJOR
LEAGUE
PITCHERS
WHILE
HES
IN
AAA
AND
SINCE
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
ANY
GLARING
PROBLEM
IN
HIS
MECHANICS
WHAT
IS
HE
GOING
TO
LEARN
IN
AAA
THAT
HE
CANT
LEARN
JUST
AS
WELL
WHILE
IN
THE
MAJORS
