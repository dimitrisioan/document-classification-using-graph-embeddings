says
dj
was
a
popular
player
in
san
diego
derek
bell
was
not
faring
well
in
the
clubhouse
at
toronto
so
no
matter
how
bad
he
looks
now
i
still
think
it
was
a
steal
for
the
jays
just
from
the
perspective
of
team
chemistry
no
statistic
can
describe
it
sorry
statheads
and
since
there
are
so
many
new
faces
in
the
clubhouse
i
think
the
jays
are
still
trying
to
find
it
insert
the
same
comment
into
the
jack
morris
v
clemens
ws
ring
string
i
laugh
at
you
now
and

will
laugh

again
equally
publicly
when
the

finish
third
due
to
the
severe
depletion
of
their
talent
i
think
bill
james
put
it
best
about
sparky

there
are
a
million
guys
in
this
country
with
great
attitudes
but
there
are
only
about
five
hundred
who
can
play
a
major
league
brand
of
baseball
which
are
you
going
to
take
