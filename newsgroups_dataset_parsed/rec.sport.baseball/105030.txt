some
evidence
that
is
not
working
take
a
look
at
the
standings
its
real
easy
to
get
so
focussed
on
minutinae
and
forget
that
the
giants
happen
to
be
in
first
place
if
its
working
you
dont
screw
it
up
by
changing
things
just
because
you
think
it
ought
to
be
different
so
that
is
the
reason
why
the
toronto
blue
jays
should
keep
alfredo
griffin
just
because
it
worked
a
team
winning
doesnt
mean
that
everything
that
its
doing
is
right
a
team
not
winning
doesnt
mean
that
everything
that
its
doing
is
wrong
or
otherwise
to
borrow
the
sharks
situation
you
would
say
that
george
kingston
should
be
fired
some
folks
like
to
argue
about
theoretical
details
i
prefer
to
watch
teams
win
when
the
giants
slip
to
third
then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrange
the
batting
order
until
then
i
think
its
stupid
to
focus
on
whats
wrong
for
the
simple
fact
that
its
working
as
it
is
by
then
its
too
late
the
problem
with
not
fixing
something
while
its
working
is
that
by
then
there
may
not
be
anything
left
to
fix
mostly
though
the
giants
are
winning
and
frankly
as
long
as
that
continues
its
rather
silly
to
secondguess
their
strategy
but
evidently
some
folks
would
rather
be
right
than
be
first
so
the
blue
jays
were
simply
perfect
last
year
there
was
nothing
that
they
could
have
done
to
have
improved
that
team
not
