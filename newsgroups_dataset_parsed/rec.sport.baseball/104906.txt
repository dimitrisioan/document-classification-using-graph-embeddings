RE
INFIELD
FLY
RULE
JROGOFFSCOTTSKIDMOREEDU
JAY
ROGOFF
WRITES
ONE
LAST
INFIELD
FLY
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
ALWAYS
PUZZLED
ME
AND
HASNT
YET
BEEN
ADDRESSED
I
BELIEVE
THE
RULE
ALSO
DOES
NOT
DEAL
WITH
THIS
SITUATION
IF
INFIELD
FLY
IS
DECLARED
AND
THE
BALL
IS
CAUGHT
RUNNERS
CAN
TAG
UP
AND
ADVANCE
AT
THEIR
OWN
RISK
AS
ON
ANY
FLY
BALL
HOWEVER
IF
THE
INFIELD
FLY
IS
NOT
CAUGHT
AT
WHAT
POINT
CAN
A
RUNNER
LEGALLY
LEAVE
HIS
BASE
WO
FEAR
OF
BEING
DOUBLED
OFF
FOR
ADVANCING
TOO
EARLY
WHEN
THE
BALL
HITS
THE
GROUND
WHEN
A
FIELDER
FIRST
TOUCHES
THE
BALL
AFTER
IT
HITS
THE
GROUND
ENLIGHTENMENT
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
IM
NOT
SURE
I
UNDERSTAND
THIS
QUESTION
WHEN
THE
IF
RULE
IS
INVOKED
THE
BATTER
IS
AUTOMATICALLY
OUT
THIS
RELIEVES
THE
RUNNERS
FROM
BEING
FORCED
TO
ADVANCE
TO
THE
NEXT
BASE
IF
THE
BALL
IS
NOT
CAUGHT
OTHER
THAN
THAT
ISNT
IT
JUST
THE
SAME
AS
ANY
SITUATION
IN
WHICH
A
RUNNER
ON
A
BASE
IS
NOT
FORCED
TO
THE
NEXT
BASE
ON
A
DROPPED
FLY
BALL
THAT
IS
IF
THE
BALL
IS
CAUGHT
HE
CAN
TAG
UP
AND
RUN
OR
DECIDE
TO
STAY
AND
IF
THE
BALL
IS
DROPPED
HE
CAN
HAVE
LEFT
THE
BASE
AT
ANY
TIME
