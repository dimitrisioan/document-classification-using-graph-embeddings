is
it
just
me
or
does
bichette
look
totally
lost
in
the
outfield
hes
been
playing
horrible
defense
baylor
said
after
wednesdays
game
that
he
wanted
to
shake
up
the
lineup
a
little
because
bichette
has
been
having
a
rough
time
defensively
and
jerald
clark
has
not
been
hitting
he
was
true
to
his
word
i
went
to
thursdays
game
and
gerald
young
was
in
right
and
daryl
boston
who
has
a
very
hot
bat
was
in
left
baylor
was
careful
to
say
though
that
he
didnt
necessarily
mean
for
these
changes
to
be
permanent
but
he
wanted
to
give
these
other
two
a
shot
while
clark
and
bichette
were
not
playing
well
in
defense
of
bichette
it
looks
like
right
field
in
mile
high
stadium
is
a
bitch
to
play
some
of
the
visiting
outfielders
have
been
having
some
problems
too
although
bobby
bonilla
made
a
great
catch
crashing
into
the
wall
to
rob
daryl
boston
of
an
extra
base
hit
in
thursdays
game
