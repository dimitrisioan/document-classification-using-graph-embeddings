RE
BASEBALLISDEAD
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
MY
QUESTION
TO
YOU
ALL
IS
WHY
DOES
THE
MEDIA
SEEM
TO
EMBRACE
THE
THEME
OF
THE
DEATH
OF
BASEBALL
SO
STRONGLY
I
HAVE
SEEN
ARTICLES
OF
A
SIMILAR
VEIN
IN
THE
CHICAGO
TRIBUNE
AND
IN
SPORTS
EDITORIALS
ON
TV
MAYBE
BECAUSE
BASEBALL
IS
THE
ONLY
BUSINESS
WHERE
THOSE
WHO
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
FISCAL
ASPECTS
OF
THE
GAME
PREACH
GLOOM
AND
DOOM
THESE
ALLEGEDLY
INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
PREDICT
BAD
TIMES
LOSING
MONEY
BANKRUPTCIES
AT
AN
ALARMING
RATE
AND
THERES
GOING
TO
BE
AN
INCREASED
DEGRADATION
OF
THE
PRODUCT
THEY
PRODUCE
COULD
YOU
IMAGINE
IBM
WITH
ALL
THEIR
PROBLEMS
PROMOTING
THEMSELVES
THE
WAY
MAJOR
LEAGUE
BASEBALL
DOES
THEIR
STOCK
WOULD
PLUMMET
TO
UNTHINKABLE
DEPTHS
NOT
THAT
THEY
ARE
TOO
FAR
FROM
IT
NOW
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
AT
GM
WHERE
WOULD
GM
BE
IF
THEY
ADMITTED
TO
CUTTING
CORNERS
AND
PRODUCING
AN
INFERIOR
PRODUCT
BECAUSE
OF
ALLEGED
LABOR
PROBLEMS
I
THINK
IT
SHOWS
A
LACK
OF
CONFIDENCE
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
RUN
THE
GAME
ANYWAY
IT
JUST
FRUSTRATES
ME
WHEN
THE
MEDIA
SAYS
SUCH
THINGS
BECAUSE
IT
INEVITABLY
LEADS
TO
OWNERS
TRYING
QUICK
FIXES
LIKE
INCREASING
PLAYOFFS
TO
SATISFY
TELEVISION
OR
TRYING
INTERLEAGUE
PLAY
TO
DRUM
UP
INTEREST
FORGET
IT
WORD
HAS
IT
THREE
DIVISIONS
WITH
A
WILD
CARD
IS
JUST
ABOUT
A
DONE
DEAL
IT
HAS
TO
BE
DECIDED
SOON
SINCE
NEGOTIATIONS
WITH
THE
NETWORKS
ALSO
HAVE
TO
BEGIN
SOON
