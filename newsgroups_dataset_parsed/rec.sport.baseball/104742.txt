KEN
KUBEY
SAID
AND
FINALLY
ID
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
MANY
HIGH
OBP
GUYS
DRAW
THEIR
WALKS
MORE
BECAUSE
PITCHERS
ARE
AFRAID
TO
THROW
A
STRIKE
TO
THEM
THAN
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
A
GREAT
EYE
IM
NOT
SURE
I
USED
TO
THINK
THIS
WAS
TRUE
BUT
MORE
AND
MORE
IM
BECOMING
CONVINCED
THAT
ITS
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
AMONG
PLAYERS
WITH
THE
PHYSICAL
ABILITY
TO
HIT
THE
BALL
REAL
HARD
THE
PATIENT
ONES
ARE
THE
ONES
WHO
GET
THE
CHANCE
TO
DO
IT
A

LETS
BREAK
DOWN
THE
FOUR
BASIC
CATEGORIES
OF
HITTER
ACCORDING
TO
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
POWER
THREATS
AND
WHETHER
THEY
WALK

OKAY
I
THINK
WE
ALL
AGREE
THAT
SINGLES
HITTERS
SHOULD
TAKE
A
STRIKE
OR
TWO
AND
TRY
TO
GET
ON
BASE
ANY
WAY
THEY
CAN
SO
THE
NO
POWERIMPATIENT
GUYS
HAVE
NO
EXCUSE
THE
NO
POWERPATIENT
GUYS
ARE
DOING
THE
RIGHT
THING
NOW
THE
IMPATIENTPOWER
GUYS
HOW
COULD
YOU
LEAVE
OUT
THE
BIG
CAT
WOULD
THESE
GUYS
HAVE
A
BETTER
SLUGGING
PERCENTAGE
IF
THEY
TOOK
MORE
PITCHES
PERHAPS
BUT
I
DOUBT
IT
IF
YOU
TELL
JOE
CARTER
TO
GO
UP
THERE
AND
TAKE
A
FEW
PITCHES
HE
WILL
DRAW
MORE
WALKS
BUT
HE
ALSO
WONT
HIT
AS
MANY
FROZEN
ROPES
INTO
THE
BLEACHERS
BECAUSE
HE
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
HOLD
BACK
ON
A
PITCH
THAT
HE
USED
TO
DRIVE
THE
PATIENTPOWER
GUYS
JOE
MORGAN
HAD
A
SMALL
STRIKE
ZONE
AND
RICKEY
HENDERSON
HAS
A
STRIKE
ZONE
THE
SIZE
OF
HITLERS
HEART
SO
THEY
GET
THEIR
WALKS
BASED
ON
THE
SMALL
ZONE
LOOK
AT
THE
OTHER
GUYS
THOMAS
BONDS
MCGWIRE
RUTH
AND
WILLIAMS
WOW
A
LOT
OF
PITCHERS
WOULD
RATHER
NIBBLE
AT
THE
CORNERS
AND
MAYBE
WALK
THESE
GUYS
THAT
TO
THROW
A
CLEAR
STRIKE
TO
THEM
THE
PITCHERS
WOULD
DO
BETTER
IN
MY
OPINION
BY
JUST
COMING
AFTER
THEM
WITH
A
GOOD
FASTBALL
FOR
A
STRIKE
ON
THE
FIRST
PITCH
BUT
PITCHERS
WOULD
RATHER
NIBBLE
GO
OR
AND
THEN
GET
HURT
