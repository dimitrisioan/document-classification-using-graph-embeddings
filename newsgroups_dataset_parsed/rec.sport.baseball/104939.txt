not
batting

writes
some
evidence
that
is
not
working
take
a
look
at
the
standings
its
real
easy
to
get
so
focussed
on
minutinae
and
forget
that
the
giants
happen
to
be
in
first
place
if
its
working
you
dont
screw
it
up
by
changing
things
just
because
you
think
it
ought
to
be
different
some
folks
like
to
argue
about
theoretical
details
i
prefer
to
watch
teams
win
when
the
giants
slip
to
third
then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrange
the
batting
order
until
then
i
think
its
stupid
to
focus
on
whats
wrong
for
the
simple
fact
that
its
working
as
it
is
ps
does
the
mailing
list
maintainer
think
that
will
clark
is
the
best
first
baseman
in
the
majors
and
that
matt
williams
is
a
better
power
hitter
than
any
other
ballplayer
in
the
majors
i
dont
follow
al
so
i
wont
comment
on
majors
in
the
nl
if
i
had
my
choice
of
any
in
the
league
for
my
team
itd
be
clark
and
id
hit
him
third
my
fantasy
team
has
both
grace
and
murray
on
it
because
ive
never
been
able
to
get
clark
id
take
any
of
the
three
without
hesitation
in
real
life
but
i
think
clark
is
it
williams
not
even
close
i
much
prefer
his
defense
but
when
he
isnt
headcasing
it
matt
has
a
good
solid
swing
and
some
real
punch
if
he
drops
to
then
he
wanders
out
of
cleanup
but
according
to
the
latest
baseball
weekly
hes
hitting
and
in
the
last
week
hitting
thats
not
exactly
chopped
liver
mostly
though
the
giants
are
winning
and
frankly
as
long
as
that
continues
its
rather
silly
to
secondguess
their
strategy
but
evidently
some
folks
would
rather
be
right
than
be
first
