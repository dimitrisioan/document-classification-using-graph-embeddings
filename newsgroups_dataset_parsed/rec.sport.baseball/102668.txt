RE
YOUNG
CATCHERS
MSSNETCOMCOM
MARK
SINGER
SAID
WE
KNOW
THAT
VERY
VERY
FEW
PLAYERS
AT
THIS
AGE
MAKE
MUCH
OF
AN
IMPACT
IN
THE
BIGS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THEY
HAVENT
EVEN
PLAYED
AAA
BALL
YES
BUT
THIS
IS
IRRELEVANT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
AVERAGES
WHEN
WE
HAVE
LOTS
OF
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THIS
PLAYER
IN
PARTICULAR
TO
BASE
OUR
DECISIONS
ON
I
MIGHT
AS
WELL
SAY
WE
KNOW
THAT
VERY
VERY
FEW
PEOPLE
ARE
MORE
THAN
FEET
TALL
SO
CHANCES
ARE
THAT
MANUTE
BOL
IS
REALLY
ONLY
FOOT
NO
MAYBE
I
NEED
TO
IMPROVE
MY
WRITING
SKILLS
LOPEZ
WHO
IS
VERY
ORDINARY
DEFENSIVELY
IS
NOT
LIKELY
TO
HIT
SO
WELL
AT
AGE
HAVING
NOT
PLAYED
AT
AAA
LEVEL
THAT
IT
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
RUSH
HIM
INTO
THE
BRAVES
LINEUP
IN
WHY
ISNT
LOPEZ
LIKELY
TO
HIT
THAT
WELL
HE
HIT
THAT
WELL
LAST
YEAR
AFTER
ADJUSTING
HIS
STATS
FOR
PARK
AND
LEAGUE
AND
SUCH
HE
HIT
BETTER
ON
AN
ABSOLUTE
SCALE
THAN
OLSON
OR
BERRYHILL
DID
BY
A
LOT
AS
FOR
RUSHING
IF
THERE
REALLY
IS
A
QUALITATIVE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
MINORS
AND
THE
MAJORS
THAT
REQUIRES
A
PERIOD
OF
ADJUSTMENT
AND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
THEN
WOULDNT
YOU
RATHER
WASTE
LOPEZS
OLD
GOOD
SEASON
THAN
HIS
OLD
VERY
GOOD
SEASON
OR
HIS
EXCELLENT
SEASON
THE
SOONER
YOU
GET
HIM
ACCLIMATED
THE
MORE
OF
HIS
PRIME
YOU
GET
TO
USE
LOPEZ
WAS
HITTING
OVER
AB
WHEN
HE
WAS
CUT
FROM
SPRING
TRAINING
WHAT
DOES
HE
HAVE
TO
DO
TO
EARN
A
CHANCE
MAYBE
NOT
A
FULL
TIME
JOB
BUT
AT
LEAST
A
COUPLE
STARTS
AND
A
FEW
AB
FOR
HIM
TO
PROVE
HIS
WORTH
GEE
I
DONT
KNOW
ABS
SOUNDS
PRETTY
GOOD
TO
ME
ABOUT
AS
GOOD
AS
YOUR
REASONING
THAT
THE
KID
SHOULD
PLAY
A
BACKUP
ROLE
RATHER
THAN
START
EVERY
DAY
AT
AAA
TALK
ABOUT
ME
AS
A
GM
THE
POINT
WAS
NOT
THAT
AB
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
SAMPLE
BUT
RATHER
THAT
HE
HADNT
DONE
ANYTHING
IN
SPRING
TRAINING
TO
CAUSE
EVEN
A
BLOCKHEAD
MANAGER
TO
QUESTION
WHETHER
HIS
MINOR
LEAGUE
NUMBERS
WERE
FOR
REAL
OR
TO
SEND
HIM
DOWN
UNTIL
HE
GETS
WARMED
UP
OK
MOST
PLAYERS
ARE
NOT
READY
FOR
THE
BIGS
AT
AGE
MOST
PLAYERS
ARE
NEVER
READY
FOR
THE
BIGS
WHAT
DOES
THIS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
JAVY
LOPEZ
MOST
PLAYERS
BENEFIT
RATHER
THAN
BEING
STAGNANT
OR
HURT
BY
PLAYING
AT
AAA
SEE
ABOVE
MOST
CATCHERS
NEED
TO
BE
SOLID
DEFENSIVELY
PLAYERS
TO
HELP
THEIR
CLUBS
IN
THE
BIGS
THOSE
ARE
THE
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
LOPEZ
FOR
THE
BRAVES
FOR
THIS
YEAR
BUT
I
COULD
APPLY
THE
SAME
REASONING
TO
FRANK
THOMAS
OR
BARRY
BONDS
MOST
PLAYERS
ARENT
THAT
GOOD
SO
THEY
PROBABLY
WONT
BE
THAT
GOOD
THIS
YEAR
EITHER
NOW
THE
BRAVES
HAVE
TWO
CATCHERS
WHO
HAVE
DEMONSTRATED
SOLID
ABILITIES
TO
CALL
GAMES
TO
WORK
WITH
THE
PITCHERS
TO
THROW
OUT
RUNNERS
AND
DEMONSTRATED
INABILITIES
TO
HIT
THEIR
WAY
OUT
OF
A
SOAP
BUBBLE
NOT
SUPERSTARS
MIND
YOU
BUT
SOLID
EXPERIENCED
VETERANS
NOT
SUPERSTARS
NOT
STARS
NOT
EVEN
GOOD
PLAYERS
MAYBE
AVERAGE
IF
WERE
BEING
CHARITABLE
THE
BRAVES
HAVE
A
VERY
SOLID
LINEUP
WITH
TWO
BIG
BATS
IN
THE
OUTFIELD
AN
EXCELLENT
PLATOON
AT
FIRST
A
SOLID
MVP
CANDIDATE
AT
THIRD
AND
ONE
OF
THE
BETTER
HITTING
SHORTSTOPS
UMMM
JUSTICE
IS
A
VERY
FINE
HITTER
PENDLETON
MIGHT
HAVE
ANOTHER
BIG
YEAR
IN
HIS
BAT
BUT
HE
MIGHT
ALSO
SPEND
THE
SEASON
IN
HAMSTRING
HELL
GANT
IS
A
BIG
QUESTION
MARK
THE
BREAMHUNTER
PLATOON
IS
DECENT
NOT
EXCELLENT
AND
HAS
ROTTEN
OBP
OR
SLG
DEPENDING
ON
WHOS
IN
BLAUSER
IS
A
VERY
VALUABLE
BAT
FOR
A
SHORTSTOP
THE
CENTER
FIELD
PLATOON
WILL
PROBABLY
HIT
HOWEVER
GOOD
LOPEZ
BAT
MIGHT
BE
GIVEN
THE
ABOVE
IT
WONT
BE
SO
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
OFFSET
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
IN
EXPERIENCE
AND
DEFENSIVE
ABILITY
WANNA
BET
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
LOPEZS
BAT
AND
OLSONBERRYHILL
COULD
BE
OR
RUNS
OVER
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
SEASON
GIVEN
A
CHOICE
BETWEEN
A
PLAYER
WITH
EXPERIENCE
AND
A
PLAYER
WHO
CAN
PLAY
ILL
TAKE
THE
LATTER
EVERY
TIME
THE
KID
WILL
IMPROVE
PLAYING
AT
AAA
JUST
LIKE
KEITH
MITCHELL
DID
I
AM
JUST
SO
SURPRISED
I
HAVE
TO
SPELL
ALL
OF
THIS
OUT
MY
GOODNESS
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THE
OTHER
POSTER
WHO
THINKS
LOPEZ
IS
BEING
HELD
DOWN
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
FUTURE
EARNING
POTENTIAL
THAT
WAS
ME
AND
YOU
SO
FAR
YOUR
ONLY
COUNTERPROPOSAL
IS
THAT
THEY
REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
GOOD
LOPEZ
IS
OR
OVERVALUE
EXPERIENCE
OR
SOME
COMBINATION
OF
THE
TWO
I
THINK
MY
INTERPRETATION
WAS
MORE
FLATTERING
TO
THE
ORGANIZATION
ARE
THEY
IDIOTS
WHO
HAVE
BUILT
THIS
BALLCLUB
WELLARGUED
BUT
INFLAMMATORY

I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
IS
ABOUT
YOU
THAT
CLOSES
POSING

SOMETHING

THE
POCKET
