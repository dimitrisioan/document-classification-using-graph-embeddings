JUST
TO
ADD
TO
THIS
VEIN
CONSIDER
THAT
RANGE
OF
A
FIRST
BASEMAN
IS
NOT
THE
ONLY
IMPORTANT
THING
HE
IS
IMO
THE
BEST
FIELDER
OF
BAD
THROWS
FROM
THE
OTHER
INFIELDERS
I
HAVE
SEEN
HIM
SCOOP
BALLS
OUT
OF
THE
DIRT
CATCH
BALLS
OFF
A
LARGE
BOUNCE
TAKE
DOWN
BALLS
OVER
HIS
HEAD
WIDE
ETC
AD
INFINITUM
AND
HE
GETS
THE
OUT
MUCH
OF
THE
TIME
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
HE
DOES
TO
SAVE
HIS
INFIELDERS
OF
ERRORS
ARE
AMAZING
YOU
HAVE
TO
GIVE
MATTINGLY
CREDIT
FOR
BEING
ABLE
TO
DO
ALL
OF
THAT
WHILE
KEEPING
HIS
FOOT
NEAR
THE
BAG
YES
I
AM
SURE
HE
GETS
A
FEW
CALLS
BECAUSE
HE
IS
