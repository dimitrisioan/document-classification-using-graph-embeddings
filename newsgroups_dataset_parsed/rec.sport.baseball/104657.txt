RE
HOW
TO
SPEED
UP
GAMES
MARGINALLY
REALISTIC
IN
ARTICLE
GARY
BUILT
LIKE
VILLANUEVA
HUCKABAY
WRITES
YOU
WANT
TO
SPEED
UP
BALLGAMES
ENFORCE
THE
TWO
MINUTES
BETWEEN
INNINGS
AS
IT
IS
MANY
FIELDS
ARE
ALLOWING
THREE
MINUTES
BETWEEN
THEM
FIFTEEN
SECONDS
BEFORE
TV
COMMERCIALS
ARE
GONE
TO
THIRTY
OR
SO
BEFORE
ACTION
BEGINS
UPON
THE
RETURN
TO
THE
GAME
TWO
MINUTES
LAST
OUT
TO
FIRST
PITCH
OR
A
BALL
IS
CALLED
DONT
GRANT
TIME
TO
BATTERS
JUST
BECAUSE
THEY
WANT
IT
THEY
MAY
GET
PISSED
AT
FIRST
BUT
THEYLL
GET
IN
LINE
ONCE
ANYTHING
THE
PITCHER
THROWS
WHILE
THEYRE
ADJUSTING
THEIR
WRISTBANDS
IS
A
STRIKE
MANDATE
A
RULE
PERMITTING
ONLY
N
SECONDS
BETWEEN
PITCHES
THE
CURRENT
RULE
IS
TOO
LENIENT
AND
THEN
ENFORCE
IT
FIFTEEN
SECONDS
IS
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
TIME
IF
THE
PITCH
ISNT
RELEASED
IN
CALL
IT
A
BALL
AND
RESTART
THE
CLOCK
IVE
ONLY
EVER
SEEN
THIS
CALLED
ONCE
BACK
AROUND
I
THINK
THAT
STEVE
CARLTON
WAS
PITCHING
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
MUCH
EFFECT
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
LOST
IS
WHEN
THERE
ARE
RUNNERS
ON
BASE
AND
THE
RULE
DOES
NOT
COVER
THIS
I
HAVE
WONDERED
WHY
A
PITCHER
IS
GIVEN
PITCHES
WHEN
HE
ENTERS
THE
GAME
LETS
BE
SERIOUS
THE
RELIEF
PITCHER
HAS
NORMALLY
BEEN
THROWING
OUT
IN
THE
BULLPEN
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
DOES
HE
REALLY
NEED
MORE
PITCHES
