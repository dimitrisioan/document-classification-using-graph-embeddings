ONE
ALSO
HAS
TO
SEPARATE
OFFENSE
INTO
BATTING
AND
BASERUNNING
WITH
THE
SPLIT
PROBABLY
SOMEWHERE
AROUND
AND
ID
GIVE
BASERUNNING
A
LITTLE
MORE
CREDIT
THAN
THAT
MAYBE
OR
EVEN
GIVE
A
TEAM
OF
ROBERTO
ALOMAR
AND
A
TEAM
OF
JOHN
OLERUDS
IDENTICAL
BATTING
STATS
WHICH
WOULDNT
BE
THAT
UNREASONABLE
AND
EVEN
IF
YOU
DONT
LET
ROBERTO
STEAL
A
SINGLE
BASE
THEYLL
SCORE
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THE
OLERUDS
BY
GOING
FIRSTTOTHIRD
MORE
OFTEN
NO
OFFENSE
GORDON
I
WOULDNT
GIVE
BASERUNNING
THAT
MUCH
VALUE
THE
ABOVE
EFFECT
IS
CLEAR
BUT
THERE
ARE
OTHER
EFFECTS
AS
WELL
IF
OLERUD
HITS
A
DOUBLE
ANY
RUNNER
ON
FIRST
WILL
SCORE
IF
ALOMAR
LEGS
AN
EXTRA
BASE
ONTO
A
HIT
IN
THE
GAP
THE
RUNNER
ON
FIRST
MAY
NEED
TO
HOLD
AT
THIRD
THUS
OLERUDS
DOUBLES
HAVE
MORE
ADVANCEMENT
VALUE
THAN
ALOMARS
OF
COURSE
ALOMAR
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
SCORE
AFTER
HITTING
A
DOUBLE
ANOTHER
REASON
NOT
TO
GIVE
TOO
MUCH
EXTRA
VALUE
TO
BASERUNNING
IS
THAT
THE
RUNS
CREATED
FORMULAS
WORK
FOR
VERY
FAST
AND
VERY
SLOW
TEAMS
NO
TEAM
IN
THE
RAN
MUCH
BUT
SOME
TEAMS
CERTAINLY
HAD
FASTER
PLAYERS
THAN
OTHERS
STILL
THE
CURRENT
RUNS
CREATED
FORMULAS
WORK
JUST
AS
WELL
IN
THE
FOR
ALL
TEAMS
BILL
JAMES
GIVES
THE
SENATORS
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
THEY
USED
HARMON
KILLEBREW
REGULARLY
AS
A
PINCH
RUNNER
AND
IN
STOLE
BASES
WITH
TIMES
CAUGHT
STEALING
YET
THEY
SCORED
SLIGHTLY
MORE
RUNS
THAN
PREDICTED
BY
RUNS
CREATED

WE
ARE
SORRY
BUT
THE
NUMBER
YOU

IMAGINARY
PLEASE
ROTATE

NO
