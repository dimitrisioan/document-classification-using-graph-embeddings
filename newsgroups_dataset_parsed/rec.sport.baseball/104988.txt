actually
i
think
the
largescale
sample
size
is
part
of
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
were
to
plot
all
the
players
in
baseball
in
regard
to
ba
vs
clutch
ba
deviation
we
would
get
some
kind
of
bell
curve
the
xaxis
being
the
deviation
in
clutch
hitting
vs
nonclutch
the
yaxis
being
the
number
of
players
certainly
there
would
be
some
players
on
the
extreme
ends
of
the
bell
right
most
definitely
my
supposition
is
that
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
players
consistently
year
after
year
at
one
end
of
the
bell
or
the
other
then
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
reasonable
conclusions
about
those
players
as
opposed
to
all
baseball
players
this
may
be
the
root
of
the
confusion
please
consider
the
following
hypothetical
with
an
open
mind
note
that
i
am
not
yet
saying
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
at
hand
suppose
we
have
a
simplified
lotto
game
you
pick
a
number
from
and
win
if
that
number
is
drawn
suppose
we
have
a
large
population
of
people
who
play
this
game
every
week
in
the
first
year
of
the
game
approximately
of
the
population
will
win
or
more
times
in
the
second
year
of
the
game
of
those
winners
will
again
be
winners
in
the
third
year
of
the
game
of
those
who
won
or
more
times
in
each
of
the
first
two
years
will
win
again
suppose
i
started
with
people
in
my
population
after
three
years
i
have
people
who
have
consistently
in
each
of
the
last
three
years
won
or
more
the
number
of
times
expected
do
we
expect
them
to
be
big
winners
in
the
fourth
year
of
the
game
no
because
we
know
there
is
no
skill
involved
nothing
about
these
consistent
winners
can
influence
their
chances
of
winning
but
suppose
we
dont
know
whether
or
not
there
is
a
chance
that
skill
might
be
involved
perhaps
some
of
the
people
in
our
population
are
psychic
or
something
how
would
we
test
this
hypothesis
we
can
look
for
correlations
in
the
population
now
most
of
the
population
will
show
zero
correlation
but
our
psychics
should
show
a
high
positive
correlation
even
if
they
arent
very
good
psychics
they
should
still
manage
to
win
or
more
times
most
years
net
result
a
small
positive
correlation
over
the
entire
population
this
probably
brings
us
to
the
heart
of
the
disagreement
i
am
having
with
others
on
this
topic
must
any
conclusion
based
on
statistical
history
be
able
to
be
applied
broadly
throughout
a
data
base
before
it
has
any
validity
is
it
impossible
or
irrational
to
apply
statistical
analysis
to
selected
components
of
the
data
base
well
zero
correlation
is
zero
correlation
you
mention
that
sabo
has
hit
poorly
in
the
clutch
over
the
last
years
but
if
we
look
at
the
past
we
find
that
clutch
patterns
are
just
as
likely
to
reverse
as
they
are
to
remain
consistent
the
length
of
the
streak
doesnt
seem
to
make
a
difference
to
the
probability
that
the
player
will
be
clutch
or
choke
the
next
year
is
there
any
reason
to
expect
this
streak
to
be
different
from
past
streaks
now
if
it
were
true
that
of
all
threeyear
streaks
remained
true
to
form
then
we
might
have
something
useful
but
then
we
wouldnt
have
zero
correlation
instead
we
have
of
all
threeyear
streaks
remain
true
to
form
and
of
all
threeyear
streaks
reverse
you
look
at
those
numbers
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
implies
more
likely
to
choke
this
year
but
it
would
be
equally
valid
to
look
at
those
numbers
and
say
three
year
choke
streak
implies
more
likely
to
be
clutch
this
year
since
the
probabilities
are
split
each
way
i
completely
accept
that
reasoning
again
what
if
we
were
to
find
the
same
individuals
at
each
end
of
the
spectrum
on
a
consistent
basis
then
we
would
have
something
useful
and
we
would
also
have
a
positive
correlation
but
for
every
individual
that
exhibits
such
a
pattern
and
holds
true
there
is
another
who
exhibits
such
a
pattern
and
then
reverses
