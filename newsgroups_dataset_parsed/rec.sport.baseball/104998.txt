ACTUALLY
I
THINK
THE
LARGESCALE
SAMPLE
SIZE
IS
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
IF
WE
WERE
TO
PLOT
ALL
THE
PLAYERS
IN
BASEBALL
IN
REGARD
TO
BA
VS
CLUTCH
BA
DEVIATION
WE
WOULD
GET
SOME
KIND
OF
BELL
CURVE
THE
XAXIS
BEING
THE
DEVIATION
IN
CLUTCH
HITTING
VS
NONCLUTCH
THE
YAXIS
BEING
THE
NUMBER
OF
PLAYERS
CERTAINLY
THERE
WOULD
BE
SOME
PLAYERS
ON
THE
EXTREME
ENDS
OF
THE
BELL
MY
SUPPOSITION
IS
THAT
IF
WE
WERE
TO
FIND
THE
SAME
PLAYERS
CONSISTENTLY
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR
AT
ONE
END
OF
THE
BELL
OR
THE
OTHER
THEN
WE
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
SOME
REASONABLE
CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT
THOSE
PLAYERS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
ALL
BASEBALL
PLAYERS
LETS
BE
CAREFUL
HERE
IF
PLAYERS
PERFORMANCE
WAS
COMPLETELY
RANDOM
IN
CLUTCHNO
CLUTCH
THEN
YOU
WOULD
STILL
EXPECT
SOME
PLAYERS
TO
BE
GOOD
IN
THE
CLUTCH
EVERY
YEAR
AND
SOME
TO
BE
NOTSOGOOD
EVERY
YEAR
WITH
TWO
YEARS
WORTH
OF
DATA
YOUD
HAVE
OF
THE
PLAYERS
GOOD
EACH
YEAR
BAD
EACH
YEAR
AND
WOULD
HAVE
ONE
GOOD
AND
ONE
BAD
YEAR
WE
HAVE
PLAYERS
FOR
YEARS
JUST
FLIPPING
A
COIN
YOUD
EXPECT
PLAYERS
TO
BE
GOOD
ALL
YEARS
AND
TO
BE
BAD
EVERY
YEAR
THIS
IS
WHAT
WE
ACTUALLY
GET
NO
OF
GOOD
YEARS
CLUTCH
PERFORMERS
COIN
FLIP
RANDOM
ESSENTIALLY
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
CLUTCH
PERFORMERS
BY
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
OF
GOOD
PERFORMANCE
IS
THE
SAME
AS
WHAT
YOU
WOULD
GET
IF
THE
PROCESS
LEADING
TO
DEVIATIONS
FROM
NONCLUTCH
PERFORMANCE
WAS
COMPLETELY
RANDOM
IF
THERE
WAS
ANYTHING
TO
CLUTCH
HITTING
AT
LEAST
IN
THIS
DEFINITION
THAT
HAD
ANY
PREDICTIVE
CAPABILITY
YOU
EXPECT
TO
SEE
THE
NUMBER
OF
PLAYERS
AT
THE
ENDS
TO
BE
MUCH
LARGER
THAN
THAT
PREDICTED
BY
FLIPPING
A
COIN
FURTHER
IF
YOU
LIMIT
YOURSELF
TO
PLAYERS
WHO
WERE
A
LOT
ABOVE
OR
BELOW
AVERAGE
IN
CLUTCH
SITUATIONS
SAY
STANDARD
DEVIATION
FROM
THE
MEAN
MORE
THAN
ONE
YEAR
THE
RANDOM
EXPLANATION
STILL
LOOKS
GOOD
IN
THE
FOUR
YEARS
THAT
I
LOOKED
AT
THE
DATA
FROM
ELIAS
THERE
WERE
PLAYERS
WITH
A
MINIMUM
OF
AT
BATS
IN
CLUTCH
SITUATIONS
THAT
WERE
SIGMA
FROM
THE
MEAN
TWO
DIFFERENT
YEARS
OF
THOSE
PLAYERS
OF
THEM
CHANGED
SIGN
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
YEARS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THEY
WERE
GREAT
CLUTCH
HITTERS
ONE
YEAR
AND
REALLY
HORRIBLE
THE
OTHER
YEAR
IF
IT
WAS
JUST
A
RANDOM
PROCESS
YOUD
EXPECT
THOSE
NUMBERS
TO
BE
EVERYTHING
THATS
BEEN
MEASURED
ABOUT
CLUTCH
HITTING
OVER
A
PERIOD
OF
YEARS
THAT
COULD
BE
USED
TO
PREDICT
ANY
ABILITY
WITH
ANY
PROPOSED
DEFINITION
HAS
LOOKED
LIKE
A
RANDOM
PROCESS
WITH
THE
CAVEAT
THAT
THERE
MAY
BE
SOMETHING
RELATED
TO
PLATOON
ADVANTAGE
THAT
COULD
BE
DRAGGED
OUT
OF
THE
DATAEG
JOHN
LOWENSTEIN
PROBABLY
NEVER
HAD
A
CLUTCH
AB
AGAINST
A
LEFTHANDED
PITCHER
BUT
HE
MIGHT
WELL
HAVE
HAD
SOME
IN
BLOWOUTS
SO
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
A
BIAS
SINCE
HIS
CLUTCH
ABS
WOULD
BE
MORE
GEARED
TO
HIS
PLATOON
ADVANTAGE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
SUBJECT
THAT
HAS
BEEN
GLANCED
AT
CASUALLY
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
PUT
A
LOT
OF
EFFORT
INTO
STUDYING
IT
AND
EVERY
ONE
OF
THEM
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
THE
ELIAS
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
UNABLE
TO
FIND
ANYTHING
THAT
WOULD
ALLOW
YOU
TO
PREDICT
HOW
SOMEONE
WILL
DO
IN
CLUTCH

BETTER
THAN
FLIPPING
