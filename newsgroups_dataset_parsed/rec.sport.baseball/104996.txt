WRITES

MARK
SINGER
WRITES
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
NOTE
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
LASORDA
SHOULD
BE
FIRED
FOR
AT
LEAST
TWO
REASONS
PUBLICLY
HUMILIATING
HIS
PLAYERS
KNUCKLING
UNDER
TO
HIS
PLAYERS
WISHES
I
DID
NOT
WRITE
THAT
IN
FACT
THOSE
STATEMENTS
WERE
A
REBUTTAL
TO
AN
EARLIER
POSTING
THAT
I
MADE
AND
THIS
WAS
CULLED
FROM
MY
STRONG
REBUTTAL
TO
THOSE
STATEMENTS
PLEASE
SLANDER
SHAME
THERE
IS
A
FINE
LINE
BETWEEN
GETTING
PLAYERS
INPUT
AND
KNUCKLING
UNDER
TO
PLAYERS
DEMANDS
A
MANAGER
MUCH
LIKE
A
MILITARY
OFFICER
NEEDS
TO
HAVE
HIS
HER
PLAYERS
COMPLETE
OBEDIENCE
AND
RESPECT
DURING
A
GAME
AFTER
THE
GAME
ITS
NO
BIG
DEAL
BUT
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
TIME
TO
DO
MORE
THAN
REACT
PLAYERS
MUST
TRUST
THE
MANAGER
OR
THE
TEAM
OFTEN
FALLS
APART
SEE
BOSTON
RED
SOX
FF
AFTER
THE
GAME
ITS
NO
BIG
DEAL
AFTER
THE
EMPLOYEES
LEAVE
THE
WORKPLACE
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
THEY
SAY
ABOUT
THE
BOSS
OR
THE
COMPANY
PUHLEASE
STRAWBERRYS
DEMEANOR
AS
REPRESENTED
BY
THE
MEDIA
OFTEN
SOUNDS
LIKE
DEMANDS
I
SUSPECT
THAT
A
COMMENT
LIKE
I
ENJOY
HITTING
FOURTH
IM
USED
TO
IT
WOULD
GET
PRETTY
BRUTALLY
MISINTERPRETED
BY
THE
MEDIA
IF
IT
CAME
FROM
STRAWBERRY
RUSS
PORTER
QUOTED
STRAWBERRY
AS
SAYING
I
FEEL
MORE
COMFORTABLE
HITTING
CLEANUP
AND
I
THINK
I
PERFORM
BEST
IN
THAT
ROLE
PARAPHRASED
BY
MY
MEMORY
AND
BIAS
THAT
SEEMS
LIKE
A
FAIRLY
NONPETULANT
ANSWER
TO
WHAT
WAS
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
A
QUESTION
LIKE
HOW
DO
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
BEING
MOVED
TO
THE
THIRD
SPOT
IN
THE
ORDER
FIRST
ITS
ROSS
PORTER
SECOND
I
AM
REALLY
TIRED
OF
SEEING
THE
KIND
OF
RESPONSE
THAT
INDICATES
THAT
ALL
I
DO
IS
PARROT
WHAT
SOME
MEDIA
PERSON
SAYS
OR
WRITES
I
HAVE
A
BRAIN
IF
I
CHOOSE
TO
CHARACTERIZE
SOMETHING
IN
A
CERTAIN
FASHION
ITS
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
TO
BE
ACCURATE
IT
IS
NOT
JUST
BECAUSE
SOME
UNNAMED
MEDIOT
MADE
THE
CHARACTERIZATION
A
MORE
MEDIASENSITIVE
PLAYER
MIGHT
ANSWER
THE
MANAGER
KNOWS
WHAT
HE
IS
DOING
IF
HE
THINKS
THAT
BATTING
ME
THIRD
WILL
HELP
THE
TEAM
THEN
I
AM
ALL
FOR
IT
WED
IGNORE
THAT
ANSWER
AS
BROWN
STUFF
SO
IT
SEEMS
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
AN
OVERREACTION
TO
BRAND
DARRYLS
RESPONSE
AS
PETULANT
I
DID
NOT
BRAND
DARRYLS
RESPONSE
AS
PETULANT
BECAUSE
I
NEVER
HEARD
ANY
RESPONSE
FROM
DARRYL
I
DID
CALL
HIM
A
NAME
I
REFERRED
TO
HIM
AS
A
PRIMADONNA
SOMEONE
ELSE
CONCLUDED
THAT
I
DID
THAT
BECAUSE
I
HATE
HIM
I
DONT
HATE
HIM
I
THINK
HES
A
PRIMADONNA
IF
YOU
DISAGREE
FINE
BUT
STOP
PUTTING
WORDS
IN
MY
MOUTH

BEASTMASTER
