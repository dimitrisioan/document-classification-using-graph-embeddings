RE
YOUNG
CATCHERS
SINCE
I
WAS
THE
ONE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THESE
DIVERGENT
THREADS
OF
APPROX
POSTS
GOING
BACK
TO
THE
BRAVES
COULD
BE
BETTER
OFF
IF
AN
INJURY
HAPPENS
I
MAY
AS
WELL
INJECT
A
LITTLE
MORE
FUEL
TO
THE
FLAME
BACK
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
SPRING
TRAINING
I
THOUGH
LOPEZ
WOULD
MAKE
THE
SQUAD
EASILY
OLSON
WAS
STILL
RECOVERING
FROM
HIS
LATESEASON
INJURY
KNEE
I
BELIEVE
AND
THERE
WERE
QUESTIONS
AS
TO
WHETHER
HE
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PLAY
BEFORE
JUNE
AND
THEN
BERRYHILL
WAS
DINGED
UP
I
WAS
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
THIS
BECAUSE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
LOPEZ
CAN
HIT
AND
FIELD
THE
POSITION
BEFORE
LAST
SEASON
HE
WAS
THE
BRAVES
DEFENSIVE
CATCHER
PROSPECT
WHILE
BRIAN
DEAK
WAS
THE
BRAVES
OFFENSIVE
CATCHER
PROSPECT
BESIDES
OLSON
AND
BERRYHILL
COULDNT
HIT
THEIR
WAY
OUT
OF
A
WET
CARDBOARD
BOX
AND
DONT
WALK
ENOUGH
TO
BE
USEFUL
BUT
OLSON
RECOVERED
QUICKLY
BERRYHILL
RECOVERED
AND
THE
BRAVES
WENT
WITH
THE
TWO
VETS
I
STILL
SAY
THAT
IF
ONE
OF
THOSE
TWO
HAD
BEEN
DOWN
AT
THE
START
OF
THE
SEASON
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
GOTTEN
HIS
JOB
BACK
THERE
IS
A
CERTAIN
LOGIC
TO
KEEPING
OLSON
AND
BERRYHILL
AROUND
AFTER
ALL
ML
CATCHERS
ARE
IN
SHORT
SUPPLY
AND
SUFFER
FROM
WEAR
AND
TEAR
THERE
ARE
TEAMS
OUT
THERE
WITHOUT
ONE
AVERAGE
ML
CATCHER
CALIFORNIA
AND
SEATTLE
COME
TO
MIND
CERTAINLY
TRYING
TO
MOVE
OLSON
OR
BERRYHILL
THROUGH
WAIVERS
WOULD
BE
UNLIKELY
TO
WORK
PLUS
YOUD
HAVE
TO
EAT
THAT
SALARY
WHICH
ISNT
HUGE
BUT
ISNT
TIDDLEYWINKS
EITHER
I
THINK
OLSONS
AT
ABOUT
BERRYHILL
AT
BUT
THATS
ONLY
WHAT
I
RECALL
YES
I
THINK
ARBITRATIONELIGIBILITY
MAY
HAVE
A
ROLE
TO
PLAY
IN
THIS
ALSO
WHAT
IS
IT
THAT
OF
THE
PLAYERS
ARENT
ELIGIBLE
FOR
ARBITRATION
ONLY
THE
THAT
WERE
ON
THE
ROSTER
THE
LONGEST
ARE
ELIGIBLE
OF
COURSE
THE
SYSTEM
MAY
CHANGE
BUT
THE
EXTENT
OF
THAT
CHANGE
IS
NOT
YET
KNOWN
FROM
A
BUSINESS
STANDPOINT
IT
MAY
MAKE
SENSE
TO
KEEP
LOPEZ
DOWN
UNTIL
JUNETHE
FIRST
TIME
OLSONBERRYHILL
GO
ON
THE
DL
I
AM
STILL
DISAPPOINTED
THAT
LOPEZ
ISNT
ON
THE
TEAM
I
STILL
PREFER
TO
THINK
OF
MYSELF
AS
A
FAN
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THE
BRAVES
AND
THE
TRUTH
IS
THAT
ID
RATHER
SEE
OUR
BEST
TEAM
ON
THE
FIELD
WHICH
IMO
INCLUDES
LOPEZ
OF
COURSETODAY
WE
PLAY
THE
CUBS
HOPEFULLY
WE
WONT
NEED
HIM
AS
FOR
THE
SCHUERHOLZCOX
CONVERSATION
I
IMAGINE
IT
WENT
LIKE
THIS
REMEMBER
THEYVE
BOTH
BEEN
GMS
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
NOT
MEANT
TO
BE
READ
BY
THE
HUMORIMPAIRED
COX
OK
WEVE
SENT
JONES
DOWN
HIS
FIELDING
COULD
BE
A
LITTLE
SMOOTHER
BESIDES
BLAUSER
CAN
HIT
OK
AND
HIS
FIELDING
IS
BETTER
THAN
IT
USED
TO
BE
SCHUERHOLZ
WELL
WELL
HAVE
TO
SEND
NIEVES
DOWN
TOO
DEION
JUST
WONT
SIGN
THAT
BASEBALL
ONLY
CONTRACT
WE
CANT
COUNT
ON
HIM
IN
OCTOBER
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
KEEP
NIXON
AROUND
FOR
THE
DEFENSE
BESIDES
GORMANS
NOT
READY
TO
GIVE
UP
ON
BILLY
HATCHER
YET
ONCE
HATCHERS
GONE
AND
DEION
SIGNS
WE
CAN
MOVE
NIXON
FOR
FRANKIE
RODRIGUEZ
THAT
OUGHT
TO
GIVE
US
SOME
PITCHING
DEPTH
IN
COX
YEP
THATLL
BE
NICE
TOO
BAD
DEION
WONT
SIGN
OK
ILL
LOOK
FOR
NIEVES
WHEN
JUSTICE
STARTS
HAVING
BERRYBERRYER
BACK
PROBLEMS
AGAIN
NOW
WHAT
ABOUT
KLESKO
SCHUERHOLZ
WELL
WEVE
STILL
GOT
TO
FORK
OUT
ANOTHER
MIL
FOR
BREAM
IF
WE
KEEP
KLESKO
WE
EITHER
LOSE
THE
MONEY
OR
CABRERA
I
KEEP
DANGLING
SID
IN
FRONT
OF
DAL
MAXWELL
BUT
SOMEHOW
HE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
THE
SAME
GM
FIRST
JEFFRIES
FOR
JOSE
AND
NOW
WHITEN
FOR
CLARK
IF
HE
GETS
RID
OF
BRIAN
JORDAN
THEN
ID
HAVE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
AND
WHITEY
HERZOG
SWITCHED
BODIES
AT
THE
WINTER
MEETINGS
COX
OK
KEEP
TRYING
ON
BREAM
AND
ILL
WAIT
TIL
THE
TRADING
DEADLINE
FOR
MY
HUNTERKLESKO
PLATOON
MAYBE
I
CAN
GET
A
FEW
EXTRA
ATBATS
FOR
CABRERA
WHILE
WE
WAIT
TRY
CALIFORNIA
IF
SNOW
STARTS
SLOWLY
MAYBE
WHITEYDAL
WILL
BITE
ON
SID
AND
IF
THAT
DOESNT
WORK
THEN
PERHAPS
SIDS
KNEES
COULD
BE
PERSUADED
TO
ACT
UP
THERES
ALWAYS
THE
DL
MWAHAHAHAHA
SCHUERHOLZ
WHAT
ABOUT
CARABALLO
COX
WELL
HES
NOT
THAT
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
LEMKE
MAYBE
IF
HE
STARTS
IN
RICHMOND
HELL
START
WALKING
MORE
BESIDES
IF
HES
GOING
TO
BE
ARBITRATIONELIGIBLE
BETTER
TO
STRETCH
HIM
OUT
SO
THAT
WE
ACTUALLY
GET
SOME
VALUE
FROM
HIM
BEFORE
HE
MAKES
THE
BIG
BUCKS
SCHUERHOLZ

LETS
SEE
THAT
LEAVES
