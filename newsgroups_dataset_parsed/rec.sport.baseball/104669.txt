always
thought
that
a
reasonable
means
of
measuring
value
between
players
was
to
attempt
to
determine
if
a
team
would
trade
one
for
another
the
major
problem
with
this
analysis
is
that
it
ignores
age
even
if
morris
were
performing
as
well
as
clemens
right
now
and
were
likely
to
this
season
nobody
would
trade
clemens
for
morris
straight
up
because
clemens
has
more
of
his
career
