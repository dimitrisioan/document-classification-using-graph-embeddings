DISCLAIMER
THIS
IS
FOR
FUN
IN
MY
COMPUTERIZED
BASEBALL
GAME
I
KEEP
TRACK
OF
A
CATEGORY
CALLED
STOLEN
HITS
DEFINED
AS
A
PLAY
MADE
THAT
AN
AVERAGE
FIELDER
WOULD
NOT
MAKE
WITH
AVERAGE
EFFORT
USING
THE
DEFENSIVE
AVERAGES
POSTED
BY
SHERRI
NICHOLS
THANKS
SHERRI
IVE
FIGURED
OUT
SOME
DEFENSIVE
STATS
FOR
THE
SECOND
BASEMEN
HITS
STOLEN
HAVE
BEEN
REDEFINED
AS

KURT
STILLWELL
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
MADE
OK
I
REALIZE
THATS
UNFAIR
KURTS
PROBABLY
THE
VICTIM
OF
PITCHING
STAFF
FLUKE
SHOTS
AND
A
MONSTER
PARK
FACTOR
BUT
LETS
PUT
IT
THIS
WAY
IF
WE
REPLACED
EVERY
SECOND
BASEMAN
IN
THE

WITH
SOMEONE
WITH
KURTS
OUT
MAKING
ABILITY
HOW
MANY
EXTRA
HITS
WOULD
GO
BY
TO
TRY
AND
CORRELATE
IT
TO
REALITY
A
LITTLE
MORE
IVE
CALCULATED
NET
HITS

BASED
ON
THE
NUMBER
OF
OUTS
MADE
COMPARED

WHAT
A

WOULD
MAKE
BY
THE
SAME
METHOD
IVE
CALCULATED

LET
BY
FINALLY
I
THROW
ALL
THIS
INTO
A
A
FORMULA
I
CALL
DEFENSIVE
CONTRIBUTION
OR
DCON
BASICALLY
IT
REPRESENTS
THE
DEFENSIVE
CONTRIBUTION
OF
A

I
ADD
THIS
NUMBER
TO
OPS
TO
GET
DOPS
DEFENSE
ONBASE
PLUS
SLUG
WHICH
SHOULD

TOTAL

WHY
SUCH
A

FORMULA
BASICALLY
ITS
DESIGNED
TO
BE
ADDED
INTO

WITH
THE

THAT
A

IS
AS

AS
A

SCORED
THE

ARE
