me
too
rbi
are
a
worthless
stat
of
course
so
is
stolen
bases
because
sometimes
runners
are
in
front
of
a
player
that
would
otherwise
run
and
of
course
pitchers
pitch
differently
with
different
people
on
different
bases
so
batting
average
slugging
and
obp
out
too
hmmm
i
guess
homers
would
not
count
then
either
my
point
rbi
might
not
be
a
perfect
stat
but
nothing
is
and
no
stat
or
lack
of
can
tell
me
there
are
no
clutch
hitters
maybe
no
stat
can
tell
me
either
but
some
people
are
i
just
know
it
but
why
would
you
want
to
use
rbi
rbi
is
an
attempt
to
measure
is
some
combination
of
clutch
hitting
and
power
hitting
if
you
believe
in
clutch
hitting
then
look
at
how
the
guy
hit
with
risp
if
you
want
to
see
how
good
of
a
slugger
he
is
then
look
at
his
slugging
average
in
terms
of
evaluating
players
rbi
totals
are
better
than
nothing
but
why
use
them
when
so
many
better
stats
are
out
there
