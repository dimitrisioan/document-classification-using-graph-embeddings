had
a
couple
of
interesting
articles
about
hispanic
players
including
its
hispanic
allstar
team
some
of
the
major
points
are
nprs
morning
edition
aired
a
report
this
morning
on
hispaniclatin
american
players
in
mlb
and
how
they
have
many
of
the
same
problems
faced
by
blacknegroafrican
american
players
when
they
first
entered
the
league
however
although
baseball
has
adjusted
to
the
presence
of
black
players
many
hispanic
players
still
labor
under
the
stereotype
of
being
fireballs
hot
blooded
flashy
the
report
also
emphasised
that
despite
the
rantings
my
word
of
jessie
jackson
about
baseballs
discrimination
against
black
players
in
its
upper
echelons
baseball
has
actually
done
much
better
by
black
players
than
hispanic
players
another
interesting
point
was
the
language
barrier
problem
the
reporter
elaborated
on
an
interview
with
ruben
sierra
which
he
gave
in
spanish
to
a
spanish
speaking
newspaper
reporter
with
the
fact
that
there
are
maybe
major
baseball
writers
that
speak
spanish
despite
the
fact
that
spanish
is
one
of
if
not
the
easiest
languages
to
learn
so
easy
that
the
author
cormac
mccarthy
learned
spanish
at
age
in
order
to
research
his
book
all
the
pretty
horses
yet
few
mlb
organizations
employ
spanish
speaking
personel
one
of
the
exceptions
being
the
oakland
as
another
point
nearly
of
latin
american
players
have
some
african
blood
yet
most
report
that
theyd
never
really
felt
black
until
playing
ball
in
the
us
ironically
enough
it
is
the
early
presence
of
latin
american
baseball
players
in
the
major
leagues
that
support
the
idea
that
baseball
was
integrated
before
the
arrival
of
jackie
robinson
as
many
light
black
or
brown
latin
americans
were
incorporated
into
baseball
s
i
did
not
know
the
cure
for
the
disease
of
images
but
i
believed
in
the
healing
sandra
vigil
power
of
words
and
stories
vigilescacom
until
the
end
of
the
world
