rbis
and
runs
scored
are
the
two
most
important
offensive
statistics
you
can
talk
about
obp
and
slg
all
you
want
but
the
fact
remains
the
team
that
scores
more
runs
wins
the
game
flame
away
so
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
rbis
the
team
with
the
most
rbis
doesnt
necessarily
win
the
game
yes
runs
are
the
most
important
statistice
for
a
team
so
why
does
every
newspaper
rank
team
offense
by
batting
average
but
for
an
individual
player
runs
and
rbis
are
contextdependent
and
tell
us
very
little
about
the
player
himself
and
more
about
his
teammates
and
position
in
the
batting
order
