WRITES
KEEPING
IN
LINE
WITH
THE
PESSIMISTS
ON
THE
NET
ILL
HOLD
OFF
ON
THE
ASTROS
BEING
ALL
THE
WAY
BACK
THEY
COULD
INDEED
CONTEND
BUT
THAT
WOULD
COUNT
ON
ATLANTA
ENCOUNTERING
SOME
UNFORESEEN
PROBLEMS
SUCH
AS
INJURIES
OR
KEEPING
UP
THEIR
EARLY
SEASON
ABYSMAL
HITTING
WHILE
ATLANTA
HAS
THE
UNDISPUTED
BEST
STARTING
ROTATION
I
FEEL
THAT
THEIR
RELIEF
STAFF
MAY
BE
SUSPECT
THEY
DONT
HAVE
A
REAL
CLOSER
ALTHOUGH
MIKE
STANTON
SAVES
HAS
BEEN
USED
IN
THAT
ROLE
DIDNT
STANTON
START
OFF
GREAT
LAST
YEAR
AND
THEN
FALTER
DESPITE
THIS
YOUR
POINT
IS
WELL
TAKEN
ATLANTA
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
THE
SAME
PERSONALITY
AS
A
NY
TEAM
THUS
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
SELFDESTRUCT
FOR
HOUSTON
TO
TAKE
EM
ATLANTA
NEEDS
TO
SUFFER
SOME
INJURIES
PARTICULARLY
TO
THEIR
STARTING
ROTATION
ASTROS
RELIEF
CORPS
HOLDING
TOGETHER
IF
DOUG
JONES
KEEPS
HIS
CHANGEUP
EFFECTIVE
AND
XAVIER
HERNANDEZ
CAN
BE
EFFECTIVE
THEN
ITS
PASSABLE
THERES
NO
REASONABLE
LEFTHANDED
HELP
AND
THE
MIDDLE
RELIEF
IS
IFFY
TOM
EDENS
WAS
EXPECTED
TO
TAKE
OVER
THE
JOE
BOEVER
SETUP
MAN
ROLE
BUT
HES
BEEN
INJURED
AND
HE
WAS
AN
EXPANSION
TEAM
ACQUISITION
ANYWAY
HOUSTON
THOUGHT
THAT
BOEVER
WOULD
DEMAND
TOO
MUCH
MONEY
SO
THEY
LET
HIM
GO
DOUG
JONES
CAN
LOSE
HIS
TOUCH
HE
WENT
FROM
CLEVELANDS
ALLSTAR
CLOSER
TO
THE
MINORS
IN
A
PRETTY
SHORT
SPAN
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
BOEVER
AND
MURPHY
WERE
CONSIDERED
EXPENDABLE
BY
THE
CLUB
HOUSTON
FELT
THAT
THEIR
POSITIONS
COULD
BE
FILLED
BY
A
NUMBER
OF
PLAYERS
ART
DOUG
JONES
IS
THE
KEY
TO
HOUSTONS
SUCCESS
HE
MUST
HAVE
ANOTHER
GREAT
YEAR
FOR
HOUSTON
TO
CHALLENGE
IN
THE
NL
WEST
LOUSEY
SPRING
CLOSER
TO
THE
MINORS
IN
A
PRETTY
SHORT
SPAN
RIGHT
A
STRONG
ROTATION
WILL
TAKE
THE
PRESSURE
OFF
OF
THE
TROUBLING
BULLPEN
BIT
OF
SHAKINESS
AT
THE
FIFTH
STARTER
SLOT
BUT
THATS
BASICALLY
NORMAL
TAUBENSEE
ANTHONY
GONZALEZ
AND
CEDENO
FULFILLING
SOME
HITTING
POTENTIAL
ANTHONY
APPEARS
TO
BE
ABOUT
THERE
TAUBENSEES
SWING
LOOKS
A
LOT
BETTER
THIS
YEAR
SOLID
KNOCK
AGAINST
EXPOS
LAST
NIGHT
GONZALEZ
IS
SHOWING
SOME
EARLY
POWER
AND
CEDENO
STILL
HAS
THE
LOOPIEST
SWING
THIS
SIDE
OF
TIM
WALLACH
THE
UNSUSPECTED
STRENGTH
OF
THE
LOWER
PART
OF
THE
ORDER
HAS
SAVED
THE
CLUB
SO
FAR
BIGGIO
AND
FINLEY
JUST
ARENT
DOING
THEIR
JOB
OF
GETTING
ON
BASE
INSTEAD
OF
FILLING
HIS
ROLE
AS
AN
RBI
MAN
BAGWELL
HAS
HAD
TO
ASSUME
BIGGIO
AND
FINLEYS
JOB
BIGGIO
CONCERNS
ME
SINCE
HE
USUALLY
STARTS
THE
SEASON
VERY
STRONG
ON
A
SIDE
NOTE
ARE
YOU
AT
ALL
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
RUMORS
CONCERNING
NEXT
YEARS
UNIFORM
THERE
IS
TALK
THAT
THEIR
ROAD
UNIFORM
WILL
BE
BLECH
TRADITIONAL
GREY
WITH
THE
WORD
HOUSTON
WRITTEN
ACROSS
THE
CHEST
IF
IM
NOT
MISTAKEN
THEIR
HOME
UNIFORMS
MAY
TOTALLY
ELIMINATE
THE
COLOR
ORANGE
SHIVER
MCLANES
FAVORITE
COLOR
IS
RED
SO
IM
REALLY
UPSET
THE
CURRENT
UNFORMS
ARE
DULL
AND
THE
NEW
ONES
SOUND
HORRIBLE
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
THE
UNIFORM
OF
THE
RETURN
THEY
MAY
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
PRETTY
BUT
HOUSTON
HAD
ESTABLISHED
A
LONG
PRECIDENT
OF
WEARING
THE
UGLIEST
UNIFORMS
IN
BASEBALL
AND
I
LIKED
IT
END
OF
THE
BARGAIN
REMEMBER
TWO
YEARS
AGO
A
LITTLE
RELIEF
GOES
A
LONG
WAY
THEN
THEY
COULD
WIN
GAMES
BUT
I
DOUBT
IT
ILL
