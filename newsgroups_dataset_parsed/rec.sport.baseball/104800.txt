STEVEN
M
GOLDMAN
WRITES
SO
WHO
WILL
START
THIS
YEARS
ALL
STAR
GAME
FOR
THE
AL
PROBABLY
ALOMAR
NOT
TO
PUT
HIM
DOWN
HES
A
GREAT
PLAYER
BUT
IT
HELPS
TO
HAVE
ALL
THE
RECOGNITION
HES
HAD
PLUS
TO
PLAY
IN
A
CITY
WHICH
IS
LIKELY
TO
POUR
IN
THE
VOTES
I
LIKE
ALOMAR
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
DIFFER
WITH
YOUR
OPINION
ABOUT
A
CITY
WHICH
IS
LIKELY
TO
POUR
IN
THE
VOTES
I
ATTENDED
MANY
GAMES
LAST
YEAR
DURING
THE
BALLOTING
I
KNOW
THAT
A
GREAT
NUMBER
OF
THE
ATTENDEES
DID
NOT
FILL
OUT
THEIR
BALLOTS
BUT
LEFT
THEM
BEER
SOAKED
AND
TORN
ON
THE
FLOOR
OF
THE
STANDS
TORONTO
GETS
NO
MORE
AND
NO
LESS
VOTES
THAN
ANY
OTHER
CITY
FOR
THE
ALL
STAR
GAME
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
IS
NOT
A
ONE
TIME
THING
IVE
ATTENDED
GAMES
DURING
THE
LAST
FOUR
SEASONS
AND
IT
HAS
HAPPENED
EVERY
TIME
THE
APATHETIC
ATTITUDE
TO
ALL
STAR
BALLOTS
REALLY
OFFENDS
ME
