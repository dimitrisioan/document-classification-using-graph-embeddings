which
reminds
me
yet
again
of
a
bucscards
game
in
whitey
herzogs
last
year
as
cards
manager
karen
and
i
were
watching
the
game
on
tv
and
for
some
barely
explicable
reason
the
camera
kept
dwelling
on
the
white
rhino
himself
at
his
uniformfilling
worst
truly
horrible
do
you
remember
game
of
the
nlcs
after
the
dodgers
defeated
the
mets
and
ughadugh
fooboo
fat
stomach
tom
lasorda
came
running
out
on
to
the
field
in
celebration
yuck
he
undulated
his
arms
flew
up
and
down
keeping
time
with
his
rolling
set
of
stomachs
which
flew
all
around
the
cozy
confines
of
chavez
ravine
he
oozed
like
a
white
gastropod
he
ran
it
was
a
disgusting
sight
not
only
couldnt
i
watch
my
mets
in
the
series
i
had
to
watch
fat
stomach
lasorda
roll
around
dodger
blargh
but
what
made
it
memorable
was
what
karen
eventually
said
about
this
which
was
i
would
rather
sleep
with
a
jar
of
bill
landrums
spit
under
my
pillow
than
look
at
whitey
herzog
in
one
of
those
uniforms
if
you
like
short
fat
men
who
grunt
curse
and
spit
a
lot
whiteys
certainly
your
man
former
wfan
host
pete
franklin
on
the
white
rat
but
its
true
this
emphasis
on
the
appearance
of
ballplayers
in
tight
uniforms
only
works
if
the
player
actually
has
an
extraodinary
physique
looking
at
charlie
houghs
scrawny
torso
through
those
tight
white
shirts
just
sort
of
makes
me
decide
hmmm
i
dont
want
to
eat
lunch
todayor
tomorrowor
anytime
soon
when
al
harazin
first
became
mets
gm
he
was
asked
if
he
intended
to
help
redesign
the
mets
uniforms
and
change
their
image
in
particular
they
asked
him
about
the
orange
and
blue
racing
stripe
that
runs
down
the
sides
the
uniforms
he
said
that
hes
very
much
in
favor
of
keeping
them
because
theyre
sleek
and
theyre
sexy
