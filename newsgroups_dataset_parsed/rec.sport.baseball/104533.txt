i
would
tend
to
call
the
offensive
contributions
even
but
alomar
wins
hands
down
in
defensive
capabilities
im
not
just
talking
about
the
number
of
errors
nobody
including
lind
has
the
range
and
athleticism
at
second
base
i
cant
recall
in
the
recent
past
anyone
turning
the
double
play
better
than
alomar
well
why
dont
you
look
up
those
stats
baerga
may
not
be
the
best
defensive
second
baseman
in
the
league
but
hes
damn
good
check
the
stats
for
dps
last
year
and
see
for
yourself
according
to
the
defensive
average
stats
posted
by
sherri
baerga
had
the
highest
percentage
of
dps
turned
in
the
league
while
alomar
had
the
worst
however
alomar
had
a
higher
defensive
average
so
who
would
be
better
using
alomars
opportunities
groundballs
possible
double
plays
alomar
had
groundouts
and
turned
dps
baerga
would
have
had
with
same
da
dp
groundouts
and
dps
using
baergas
opportunites
groundballs
possible
double
plays
alomar
would
have
had
with
the
same
da
dp
groundouts
and
dps
baerga
had
groundouts
and
dps
baerga
looks
better
though
its
possible
his
dp
would
be
lower
with
a
different
ss
will
baerga
consistently
turn
twice
as
many
double
plays
however
alomar
has
established
a
high
level
of
defense
baerga
has
not
i
would
bet
on
alomar
to
be
better
next
year
but
last
year
baerga
was
just
as
good
overall

at

it
is

to
