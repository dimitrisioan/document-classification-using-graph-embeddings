SHERRI
NICHOLS
WRITES
A
REASONABLE
UMPIRE
WOULD
DO
AS
HES
BEEN
INSTRUCTED
TO
DO
THIS
SEASON
GET
THE
BATTERS
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
SOONER
TO
TRY
TO
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
RIDICULOUS
LENGTH
OF
GAMES
I
FOR
ONE
AM
GLAD
TO
SEE
THIS
HAPPEN
AND
HOPE
MORE
UMPIRES
WILL
DO
AS
HIRSCHBECK
DID
IN
INSTRUCTING
THE
PITCHER
TO
PITCH
IF
THE
BATTER
WONT
GET
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
A
REASONABLE
UMPIRE
WOULD
HAVE
RECOGNIZED
THAT
RON
GANT
WAS
DISTURBED
WITH
THE
CALL
A
REASONABLE
UMPIRE
WOULD
HAVE
REALIZED
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
GAME
IN
PROGRESS
WITH
TWO
OUTS
IN
THE
NINTH
WHAT
RON
GANT
DID
WAS
TRY
TO
REGAIN
HIS
COMPOSURE
WHAT
A
NORMAL
BASEBALL
PLAYER
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TO
GET
INTO
A
HEATED
ARGUMENT
WITH
THE
UMPIRE
AND
SINCE
YOU
CANT
ARGUE
BALLS
AND
STRIKES
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EJECTED
FROM
THE
GAME
RON
GANT
BY
TRYING
TO
AVOID
SUCH
A
CONFLICT
WAS
PENALIZED
FOR
SHOWING
SOME
RESTRAINT
INCIDENTALLY
A
REASONABLE
HOME
PLATE
UMPIRE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SO
RESISTANT
TO
SEEKING
THE
APPEAL
TO
THE
FIRST
BASE
UMPIRE
AS
GANT
REQUESTED
IF
THE
HOME
PLATE
UMPIRE
HAD
APPEALED
TO
FIRST
THE
FIRST
BASE
UMPIRE
COULD
HAVE
WRUNG
UP
THE
STRIKE
AND
GANT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SO
UPSET
IF
THE
CALL
HAD
BEEN
A
BALL
AND
THE
CATCHER
HAD
REQUESTED
THE
APPEAL
IT
IS
LIKELY
THE
HOME
PLATE
UMPIRE
WOULD
HAVE
ASKED
FOR
THE
HELP
FINALLY
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
WAS
PRETTY
MUCH
A
MOCKERY
OF
THE
SOCALLED
EFFORTS
TO
SPEED
UP
THE
GAME
THE
GAME
WAS
PLAYED
VERY
QUICKLY
IT
WAS
JUST
AT
HOURS
WHEN
THE
STUFF
HAPPENED
IN
THE
NINTH
AND
THE
ONLY
DELAYS
IN
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
HAD
BEEN
THE
RESULT
OF
ACTIONS
BY
THE
UMPIRES
OTHER
THAN
DEION
HAVING
TO
CLEAN
GARBAGE
OFF
THE
FIELD
