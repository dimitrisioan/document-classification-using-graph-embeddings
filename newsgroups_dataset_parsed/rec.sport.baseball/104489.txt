HEY

DONT

BOSTON
WITH
ANY
WORLD
SERIES
RINGS
ON
THEIR
FINGERS
YAH
SO
DAMN
MORRIS
NOW
HAS
THREE
AND
PROBABLY
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
IN
HIS
FUTURE
HE
CERTAINLY
DIDNT
EARN
HIS
LAST
ONE
HOW
MANY
GAMES
DID
HE
BLOW
IN
THE
WORLD
SERIES
ALL
OF
THE
ONES
HE
STARTED
THEREFORE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
TORONTO
EASILY
MADE
THE
BEST
SIGNING
OH
YES
DEFINITELY
THEREFORE
MORRIS
IS
BETTER
THAN
CLEMENS
DONT
GIVE
ME

SHIT
IF
BOSTON
HAD
ALOMAR
OLERUD
HENKE
AND
WARD
WHILE
TORONTO
HAD
RIVERA
JACK
CLARK
JEFF
REARDON
THINGS
WOULD
HAVE
LOOKED
A
LITTLE
DIFFERENT
LAST
FALL
GIVE
CREDIT
WHERE
CREDIT
IS
DUE
THIS
LAVISHING
OF
PRAISE
ON
MORRIS
MAKES
ME
SICK
AND
DONT
TELL
ME
BOSTON

YEAR

WONT
EVEN
BE
IN
THE
TOP
IN
THE
DIVISION

LIKE
IM
WILLING
TO
BET
