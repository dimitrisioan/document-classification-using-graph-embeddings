proposed
catcher
resub
rule
a
lot
of
teams
carry
catchers
on
their
man
roster
but
the
catcher
is
seldom
ever
used
he
is
only
insurance
in
case
of
extra
innings
or
the
catcher
is
injured
during
a
game
so
to
free
up
this
roster
spot
for
an
extra
pinch
hitter
or
reliever
why
not
invoke
a
catcher
resubstitution
rule
if
the
last
roster
catcher
on
a
team
is
injured
during
a
game
the
team
is
permitted
to
substitute
in
his
place
for
defensive
purposes
a
catcher
who
has
previously
been
yanked
from
the
game
given
this
rule
a
team
wouldnt
need
roster
catchers
the
catcher
could
be
playing
in
aaa
or
be
a
nonroster
bullpen
