re
notes
on
jays
vs
indians
series
something
else
to
consider
alomars
hr
splits
were
slg
obp
baergas
was
and
pretty
clearly
alomar
got
a
huge
boost
from
his
home
park
not
necessarily
it
could
mean
that
or
it
could
mean
that
he
just
hit
a
lot
better
at
home
than
he
did
on
the
road
see
frank
thomas
homeroad
splits
in
for
an
example
i
would
guess
that
some
of
alomars
split
is
due
to
the
skydome
but
most
of
it
is
probably
due
just
to
coincidence
theres
no
way
to
be
sure
of
course
but
the
only
hitters
the
skydome
seems
to
regularly
help
a
lot
are
right
handed
home
run
hitters
and
alomar
is
not
a
home
run
hitter
id
say
you
could
make
a
good
for
them
being
about
equal
right
now
tp
rated
baerga
higher
actually
only
because
of
tps
bogus
fielding
stats
which
rate
alomar
as
the
worst
defensive
second
baseman
in
the
league
on
a
career
basis
i
think
tps
fielding
stats
may
mean
something
but
on
a
seasonal
basis
it
comes
up
with
ridiculous
results
like
this
alomar
may
not
be
the
god
of
fielding
the
media
says
he
is
but
he
sure
isnt
the
worst
in
baseball
offensively
tp
rate
alomar
much
higher
last
year
regarding
the
a
vs
b
argument
ill
just
say
theyre
both
very
good
players
with
different
strengths
and
a
bright
future
