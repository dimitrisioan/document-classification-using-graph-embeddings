INCIDENT
DELETED
A
REASONABLE
UMPIRE
WOULD
DO
AS
HES
BEEN
INSTRUCTED
TO
DO
THIS
SEASON
GET
THE
BATTERS
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
SOONER
TO
TRY
TO
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
RIDICULOUS
LENGTH
OF
GAMES
I
FOR
ONE
AM
GLAD
TO
SEE
THIS
HAPPEN
I
AGREE
THAT
HIRSCHBECK
WAS
JUST
DOING
WHAT
HE
WAS
INSTRUCTED
TO
DO
AND
ALSO
THAT
GANT
SHOULD
HAVE
LISTENED
TO
HIM
HOWEVER
WHAT
IS
WITH
THIS
POLICY
OF
TRYING
TO
SPEED
UP
THE
GAMES
YOU
ARE
THE
FIRST
PERSON
NONMEDIOT
I
HAVE
SEEN
ENDORSE
THIS
POLICY
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
LENGTH
OF
GAMES
AT
ALL
AND
AM
TIRED
OF
THE
ESPN
CROWD
AND
OTHER
ANNOUNCERS
BITCHING
ABOUT
IT
I
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
IN
A
BALLPARK
FILLED
WITH
PEOPLE
LOOKING
AT
THEIR
WATCHES
AND
SHOUTING
HURRY
UP
IF
I
COUGH
UP
BIG
BUCKS
FOR
A
TICKET
I
DONT
MIND
A
GAME
THAT
LAST
MORE
THAN
I
REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IT
GAMES
ARE
LONGER
NOW
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONSSTUFF
DELETED
MAYBE
I
AM
JUST
A
NEERDOWELL
WITH
NOTHING
BETTER
TO
DO
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
REASONS
WHY
THE
LONGER
GAMES
UPSET
YOU
WELL
I
DONT
WANT
SHORTER
GAMES
PER
SE
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
FOR
THEM
TO
STOP
WASTING
SO
MUCH
TIME
DURING
GAMES
THE
GANT
INCIDENT
IS
A
PERFECT
EXAMPLE
WHEN
A
GUY
COMES
TO
THE
PLATE
HE
SHOULD
BE
UP
THERE
TO
HIT
NOT
SHOW
OFF
OR
SHOW
UP
THE
UMPIRE
WHICH
IS
CLEARLY
WHAT
GANT
WAS
DOING
I
FEEL
LIKE
