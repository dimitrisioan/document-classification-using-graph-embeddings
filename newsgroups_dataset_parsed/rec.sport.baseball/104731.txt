WRITES

ERIC
ROUSH
WRITES
THAT
HED
BEEN
THROWN
OUT
AND
GANT
HAD
A
LEGITIMATE
BEEF
ABOUT
THE
PITCH
THAT
WAS
CALLED
A
STRIKE
A
REASONABLE
UMPIRE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
TRIED
TO
FORCE
GANT
BACK
INTO
THE
BOX
IN
THAT
SITUATION
A
REASONABLE
UMPIRE
WOULD
DO
AS
HES
BEEN
INSTRUCTED
TO
DO
THIS
SEASON
GET
THE
BATTERS
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
SOONER
TO
TRY
TO
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
RIDICULOUS
LENGTH
OF
GAMES
I
FOR
ONE
AM
GLAD
TO
SEE
THIS
HAPPEN
AND
HOPE
MORE
UMPIRES
WILL
DO
AS
HIRSCHBECK
DID
IN
INSTRUCTING
THE
PITCHER
TO
PITCH
IF
THE
BATTER
WONT
GET
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
WHILE
I
CAN
SEE
WHY
THEY
WANT
TO
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
TIME
SPENT
WALKING
AROUND
GANT
WASNT
ORDERED
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
SOONER
HE
WAS
ORDERED
BACK
IMMEDIATELY
AS
SOON
AS
HE
STEPPED
OUT
HIRSCHBECK
TOLD
HIM
TO
GET
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
NOW
GANT
DOESNT
TAKE
A
LOT
OF
WALKS
BETWEEN
PITCHES
THE
ONLY
REASON
HE
DID
THEN
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
VERY
BOTHERED
BY
THE
CALL
I
EXPECT
HIS
CONCENTRATION
WASNT
THERE
YET
AND
IN
A
CRUCIAL
SITUATION
I
IMAGINE
ITS
BEST
TO
BE
AS
CALM
AS
POSSIBLE
CONTRIBUTING
FACTORS
WOULD
BE
GANTS
BAD
DAY
AT
THE
PLATE
BAD
YEAR
AT
THE
PLATE
AND
THE
BRAVES
LONG
SCORING
DROUGHT
NOW
ITS
PRETTY
STUPID
TO
GO
AHEAD
AND
TALK
THE
WALK
WHEN
THE
UMPIRE
IS
TELLING
YOU
TO
GET
IN
THERE
YOU
KNOW
THE
UMPIRE
IS
GOING
TO
DO
SOMETHING
CALL
FOR
A
STRIKE
THROW
YOU
OUT
ETC
GANT
WAS
WRONG
BUT
HIRSCHBECK
WAS
MORE
WRONG
IN
MY
BIASED
VIEW
ASIDE
FROM
THE
MAJOR
CHIP
HE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
ON
HIS
SHOULDER
WHAT
WAS
THE
PROBLEM
GANT
HAD
A
REASON
TO
WANT
SOME
TIME
DISPUTED
STRIKE
CALL
GANT
HADNT
BEEN
WASTING
TIME
ALL
GAME
THE
GAME
HAD
BEEN
CRUISING
ALONG
AND
WAS
JUST
OVER
TWO
HOURS
OLD
THE
SCORE
WAS
WITH
OUTS
IN
THE
NINTH
AND
A
RUNNER
IN
SCORING
POSITION
IS
THERE
ANY
REASON
HIRSCHBECK
COULDNT
AND
SHOULDNT
CUT
GANT
A
LITTLE
SLACK
FOR
NO
DISCERNIBLE
CONSTRUCTIVE
REASON
HIRSCHBECK
DISRUPTED
THE
GAME
CAUSED
A
FIVE
MINUTE
DELAY
AND
MATERIALLY
HURT
THE
BATTER
IN
A
KEY
SITUATION
DID
HE
HAVE
A
DATE
TO
GET
TO
AND
I
STILL
WONDER
WHY
TERRY
WAS
TOSSED
EARLIER
