MANUEL
LEE
IS
BETTER
THAN
JEFF
BLAUSER
AGAIN
IF
YOU
HAD
LEE
ON
YOUR
TEAM
LAST
YEAR
YOU
WOULD
BE
WEARING
A
RING
THIS
YEAR
ERNO
ERYES
IF
MANNY
LEE
WAS
ON
YOUR
TEAM
LAST
YEAR
YOUR
TEAM
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
TORONTO
BLUE
JAYS
MY
TEAM
IS
THE
ALBUQUERQUE
LEFTTURNS
IF
MANNY
LEE
WERE
ON
MY
TEAM
I
WOULD
NOT
BE
WEARING
A
RING
NOR
WOULD
HE
IF
HOWEVER
I
WERE
ON
MANNY
LEES
TEAM
AGAIN
IF
MANNY

JAYS
THE
TORONTO
BLUE
JAYS
I
MIGHT
WELL
BE
WEARING
A
RING
NOT
THAT
THATS
SUCH
A
BIG
DEALEVERYBODY
GOT
A
WS
RING
FROM
THE
JAYS
WIN
THATS
THE
WHOLE
POINT
ISNT
IT
CLEMENS
DIDNT
GET
A
RING
BUT
MORRIS
DID
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
THE
BLUE
JAYS
DID
NOT
WIN
BECAUSE
JACK
MORRIS
WAS
ON
THE
TEAM
JACK
MORRIS
WON
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
ON
THE
BLUE
JAYS
IT
WAS
A
TEAM
EFFORT
NOT
AN
INDIVIDUAL
ONE
EXACTLY
AND
MORRIS
WAS
PART
OF
THE
TEAM
WOULD
THE
JAYS
HAVE
WON
WITH
CLEMENS
WE
WILL
NEVER
KNOW
BUT
WE
DO
KNOW
THAT
THE
JAYS
WON
WITH
MORRIS
SO
HOW
COULD
YOU
POSSIBLY
SAY
THAT
CLEMENS
HAD
A
BETTER
YEAR
NO
PITCHER
IN
BASEBALL
COULD
HAVE
HAD
A
BETTER
YEAR
THAN
MORRIS
HAD
LAST
YEAR
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
