the
rotation
has
changed
due
to
a
strange
injury
to
scott
erickson
he
developed
a
twinge
in
the
stomach
area
and
has
been
taken
out
of
the
rotation
new
rotation
to
the
best
of
my
minds
knowledge
is
kevin
tapani
jim
deshais
pat
mahomes
willie
banks
add
mike
trombley
in
there
somewhere
since
they
need
five
people
mark
guthrie
will
remain
in
the
bullpen
as
the
long
lefty
as
to
ss
and
short
will
be
played
by
scott
leius
who
played
short
for
much
of
his
career
before
the
twins
at
third
mike
pagliarulo
and
jeff
reboulet
will
platoon
pags
and
terry
jorgenson
will
platoon
at
third
with
reboulet
as
the
backup
infielder
pags
looked
pretty
miserable
yesterday
for
a
guy
who
lead
the
league
in
da
in
muffing
what
should
be
routine
grounders
heck
muffing
a
grounder
i
would
probably
have
gotten
to
jorgenson
did
nothing
exceptional
that
i
noticed
leius
missed
a
ball
i
think
gagne
would
have
reached
we
will
certainly
miss
gags
glove
this
season
winfield
has
struggled
during
preseason
sunday
against
the
colorado
rockies
he
went
for
with
rbis
and
scored
once
he
looked
pretty
good
there
contrary
to
what
the
mediots
have
been
saying
he
looked
reasonable
at
first
he
isnt
hrbek
but
then
neither
is
the
pretty
big
guy
himself
any
more
note
im
used
to
seeing
the
twins
looking
kinda
big
on
the
field
but
not
that
big
if
he
hits
vaguely
like
last
year
hes
a
perfectly
good
first
baseman
note
much
of
this
posting
is
from
personal
observation
yesterday
in
a
game
where
the
regulars
were
mostly
pulled
after
several
innings
winfield
may
have
big
holes
in
his
defensive
game
that
didnt
show
up
he
didnt
have
to
pick
any
bad
throws
for
example
but
ill
take
what
i
saw
so
far
david
thornley
have
tickets
will
travel
to
dome
