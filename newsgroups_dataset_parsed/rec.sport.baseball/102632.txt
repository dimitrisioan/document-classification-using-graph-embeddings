JIM
LEFEBVRE
IS
AN
IDIOT
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
LET
EVERYONE
KNOW
THAT
I
HAVE
LOST
WHAT
LITTLE
RESPECT
I
HAVE
FOR
JIM
LEFEBVRE
AFTER
SEEING
TODAYS
CUBS
GAME
FIRST
OF
ALL
HOW
COULD
HE
START
MALDONADO
OVER
MAY
AFTER
THE
WAY
MAY
PLAYED
AT
THE
END
OF
LAST
YEAR
AND
THE
WAY
HE
TORE
UP
THE
CACTUS
LEAGUE
HOW
COULD
YOU
LET
HIM
SIT
THE
BENCH
NOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
A
RIGHT
HANDER
MADDUX
STARTED
I
REALLY
BLEW
MY
TOP
WHEN
LEFEBVRE
PINCH
HIT
FOR
RICK
WILKINS
WITH
TOMMY
SHIELDS
HOW
CAN
YOU
DO
THAT
JUST
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LEFTYRIGHTY
THING
TOO
MUCH
IS
MADE
OF
THAT
WILKINS
IS
TWICE
THE
HITTER
THAT
SHIELDS
IS
THEN
THE
NEXT
BATTER
WAS
JOSE
VIZCAINO
ONE
OF
THE
WEAKEST
HITTERS
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN
AND
WHO
HAD
LOOKED
TERRIBLE
AT
BAT
ALL
DAY
AND
LEFEBRE
LET
HIM
HIT
WHILE
MAY
STILL
SAT
THE
BENCH
I
THINK
EVEN
ARNIE
HARRIS
WAS
STUNNED
BY
THIS
BECAUSE
HE
SHOWED
MAY
SITTING
IN
THE
DUGOUT
WHILE
VIZCAINO
WAS
BATTING
FACE
IT
LEFEBVRE
HAS
GOT
TO
BE
THE
WORST
MANAGER
IN
BASEBALL
A
DISHARD
CUB
FAN
