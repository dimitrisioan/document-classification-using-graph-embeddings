anyone

i
think
that
stark
does
this
sort
of
thing
as
a
joke
not
as
a
serious
prediction
i
dont
really
see
why
we
should
shoot
him
for
that
the
guys
who
ought
to
be
shot
are
the
ones
who
keep
claiming
how
great
the
royals
chances
are
in
the
al
west
since
all
evidence
indicates
that
they
arent

and
actually
believe
