advertised
commercialized
to
death
during
the
local
rockies
broadcast
the
other
day
don
baylor
went
out
to
bring
in
a
relief
pitcher
and
a
graphic
came
up
on
the
screen
that
it
was
the
so
and
so
sponsored
pitching
change
i
saw
another
game
where
the
pinch
hitter
was
sponsored
at
other
times
during
the
game
rockies
announcer
duane
kuiper
was
setting
up
the
strategy
that
the
defense
might
use
with
the
expectation
that
charlie
jones
would
jump
in
and
discuss
the
situation
but
what
does
charlie
do
he
reads
a
beer
advertisement
and
leaves
duane
hanging
duanes
strategy
proved
prophetic
these
examples
happen
over
and
over
on
radio
and
tv
braodcasts
making
them
sometimes
very
boring
to
listen
to
i
guess
its
just
a
matter
of
time
before
a
player
sells
his
name
to
budweiser
nike
etc
i
dont
think
it
will
be
long
until
we
hear
nike
budweiser
drills
it
deep
to
left
field
