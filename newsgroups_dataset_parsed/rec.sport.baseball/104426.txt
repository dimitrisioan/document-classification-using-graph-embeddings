DODGER
WRITES
DAVIS
AND
STRAWBERRY
ATTRIBUTED
THEIR
TURN
AROUNDS
TO
REGGIE
SMITH
THE
DODGER
BATTING
COACH
WHO
FLEW
IN
FROM
FLORIDA
THREE
DAYS
AGO
AND
GAVE
THEM
A
PEP
TALK
AND
SOME
INSTRUCTION
DAVIS
WAS
YESTERDAY
AND
HAD
A
COUPLE
MORE
HITS
TODAY
STRAWBERRY
HAD
TWO
HITS
YESTERDAY
AND
I
BELIEVE
HE
HAD
TWO
MORE
TODAY
WITH
TWO
HOME
RUNS
FOOLISH
ME
AND
HERE
I
THOUGHT
IT
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
WERE
HITTING
AGAINST
WAKEFIELD
WHO
HAD
NO
KNCUKLE
TO
HIS
BALL
THAT
DAY
AND
OTTO
WHO
HAS
NO
STUFF
I
WONDER
IF
REGGIE
GAVE
THE
SAME
PEP
TALK
AND
INSTRUCTION
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
LINEUP
WHO
ALSO
SUDDENLY
CAME
ALIVE
THOSE
TWO
GAMES

BEASTMASTER
