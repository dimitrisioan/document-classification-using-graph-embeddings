from

in
my
last

big
zero
sauer
has
yet
to
make
a
forceful
agreement
in
favor
of
revenue
sharing
i
meant
argument
instead
of
agreement
also
i
think
i
should
add
a
coouple
of
teds
positive
achievements
smiley
trade
was
good
for
the
pirates
but
i
think
ted
could
have
gotten
someone
better
than
neagle
cummings
seems
to
be
pretty
good
the
cole
trade
was
excellent
but
simmons
has
botched
it
up
now
this
years
draft
seems
to
have
gone
well
for
the
pirates
but
then
they
lost
high
picks
in
the
bonds
fiasco
oh
well
i
should
give
up
trying
to
prove
that
simmons
is
not
a
total
idiot
