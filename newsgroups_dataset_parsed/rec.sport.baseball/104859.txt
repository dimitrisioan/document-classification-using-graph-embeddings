if
black
players
cant
survive
being
mediocre
or
worse
how
can
mcrae
and
chamberlain
be
explained
nobodys
saying
its
a
hard
and
fast
rule
my
point
is
that
white
players
are
likely
to
stick
around
longer
if
theyre
mediocre
i
went
through
tb
iii
and
made
a
list
of
of
and
who
were
negative
in
both
adjusted
batting
runs
and
total
player
rating
tpr
has
some
problems
but
its
generally
not
too
far
off
for
a
career
imho
all
players
who
played
most
of
their
career
after
were
considered
here
are
a
through
i
havent
done
the
rest
yet

a
few
black
players
there
a
lot
of
white
and
hispanic
hmmmone
questionhow
do
you
differentiate
hispanic
and
black
after
all
some
people
fall
into
both
categoriesrafael
ramiriez
comes
to
mindand
hed
fit
into
this
grouping
also
oopshes
not
an
he
is
a
lighthitting
utility
player
sorry
about
that
but
miguel
dilone
would
qualify
if
i
remember
correctly
when
i
say
black
i
mean
usborn
black
people
for
the
purposes
of
this
discussion
hispanic
players
were
in
baseball
before
and
one
team
in
the
signed
lots
of
hispanics
because
they
went
over
better
with
the
local
audience
than
blacks
did
and
why
would
more
hispanics
stick
around
than
blacks
dont
know
but
remember
this
is
the
country
that
had
special
racial
laws
for
one
group
and
one
group
only
blacks
our
national
history
includes
huge
longterm
global
tensions
regarding
the
black
minority
the
hispanic
minority
while
often
discriminated
against
has
never
been
the
object
of
national
obsession
it
might
also
be
worth
your
while
to
subdivide
the
data
into
careers
starting
at
intervals
i
would
think
that
your
prediction
would
be
most
true
for
careers
starting
in
the
and
least
true
for
careers
starting
in
the
of
course
youd
also
have
to
compare
total
ml
racial
percentages
for
the
era
in
question
absolutely
as
i
said
before
i
expect
that
this
effect
is
disappearing
but
it
certainly
did
exist
and
all
out
talk
of
twgs
and
all
that
is
not
without
some
small
reason
im
of
the
opinion
that
your
point
is
less
valid
today
than
it
was
years
ago
but
i
would
be
curious
to
see
the
data
well
theres
the
list
go
for
it
ill
cull
some
more
names
as
i
go
i
expect
youre
right
btw
