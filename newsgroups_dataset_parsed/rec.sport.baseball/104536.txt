ive
never
seen
a

who
can

talent
like
he
can
one
of
the
best

league
and
hes
still
finding
a
way
to
lose
ill
be
surprised
if
he
makes
it
through
the
next
weeks
unless
drastic
improvement
is
made
kc
news
was
doing
a
report
on
that
they
said
that
mcrae
is
really
a
batting
coach
and
not
a
manager
but
for
some
reason
he
took
the
job
whatever
the
reason
the
royals
need
a
new
manager
