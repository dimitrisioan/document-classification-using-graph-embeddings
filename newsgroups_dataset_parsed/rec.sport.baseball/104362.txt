HECK
IF
DAVE
WINFIELD
HOHUM
IS
SERIOUSLY
BEING
CONSIDERED
FOR
IT
AS
IS
LEE
SMITH
HA
THEN
WHY
DONT
WE
GIVE
DAVE
KINGMAN
A
CHANCE
OR
DARRELL
EVANS
YEAH

AFTER
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
TAKES
IN
THEM
IT
CAN
TAKE
IN
EDDIE
MURRAY
AND
JEFF
REARDON
WELL
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
SICK
AND
TIRED
MOSTLY
SICK
OF
EVERYBODY
GIVING
HALL
OF
FAME
CONSIDERATION
TO
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
BY
TODAYS
STANDARDS
MARGINAL
HONESTLY
OZZIE
SMITH
AND
ROBIN
YOUNT
DONT
BELONG

SHORTSTOPS

BIG
DEAL
LETS

MORE
SELECTIVE
HUH

HANDING
OUT
THESE
HONORS

LIBERALLY
SAVE
THEM
FOR
THE
GUYS
WHO

DESERVE
IT
FACE
IT
IF
SOMETHING
ISNT
DONE
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
PRESTIGE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
ANYMORE
WHEN
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE
THAT
STEVE
GARVEY
OR
JACK
MORRIS
ARE
POTENTIAL
CANDIDATES
THE
ABSURDITY
IS
APPARENT
GEE
CAN
THESE

EVEN
COMPARE
TO
THE
MORE
LIKELY
FUTURE
HALL
OF
FAMERS
LIKE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
OR
NOLAN
RYAN
Q
STEVE
WHATS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
NOLAN
RYAN
AND
YOUNT
BOTH
HAVE
HUNG
AROUND
FOR
YEARS
AND
CONTINUE
TO
POST
GREAT
STATS
WHY
SHOULDNT
DAVE
KINGMAN
GET
INTO
THE
HALL
OR
MURRAY
EVENS
REARDON
AND
OTHERS
WHAT
THE
HELL
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
ASK
AN
OPPOSING
PITCHER
WHETHER
HE
THINKS
THAT

SHOULD
BE
IN
THE
HALL
GOD
PRETTY
SOON
YOULL
BE
SAYING
