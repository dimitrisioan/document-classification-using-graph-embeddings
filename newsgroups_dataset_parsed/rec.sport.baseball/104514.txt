RE
EVIL
SMILE
ON
MY
FACE
AS
CUBS
BEAT
BRAVES
BOY
HATS
OFF
TO
ANY
CUBS
FAN
WHO
CAN
ACTUALLY
MUSTER
UP
THE
COURAGE
TO
PUT
DOWN
BRAVES
FANS
I
MEAN
ALL
THE
BRAVES
HAVE
DONE
IS
GONE
TO
TWO
CONSECUTIVE
WORLD
SERIES
ALSO
BEING
THE
CUBS
FAN
THAT
I
AM
I
REALLY
HAVE
TO
HAND
IT
TO
ALL
THE
BRAVES
FANS
OUT
THERE
THAT
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
DRIVING
ME
CRAZY
WITH
THAT
INFERNAL
CHEER
THAT
THEY
HAVE
HOWEVER
I
DO
HAVE
TO
PROTEST
ANYONE
SAYING
THAT
ALL
CUBS
FANS
ARE
STUPID
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
EITHER
IM
JUST
TOO
STUPID
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
IT
OR
THAT
OBSERVATION
WAS
JUST
PLAIN
WRONG
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
US
CONFUSED
WITH
BEAR
FANS
ANYWAY
ABOUT
A
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYONE
WAS
SAYING
THAT
THE
CUBS
WOULD
FINISH
UP
LAST
IN
THEIR
DIVISION
EVEN
BEHIND
FLORIDA
SHEESH
THESE
SAME
PEOPLE
WERE
PREDICTING
THE
BRAVES
TO
CLEAN
UP
IN
THEIR
RESPECTIVE
DIVISION
WELL
WERE
TEN
GAMES
INTO
THE
SEASON
AND
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
A
LITTLE
LESS
VOCAL
NOW
I
WONDER
WHY
WELL
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
THE
EAST
IS
UP
FOR
GRABS
AND
WHOEVER
WANTS
IT
MOST
IS
GOING
TO
TAKE
IT
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
FLORIDA
EVERY
TEAM
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
GOOD
BATTING
AND
PITCHING
WITH
PHILLY
PRESENTLY
LEADING
THE
PACK
BUT
I
JUST
HAVE
TO
POINT
OUT
IF
THE
CUBS
DO
TAKE
THE
EAST
THEYLL
DO
IT
WITHOUT
THE
BENEFIT
OF
A
COMPETENT
MANAGER
HOWEVER
AND
IT
PAINS
ME
TO
SAY
IT
THE
PENNANT
IS
GOING
TO
GO
TO
THE
WEST
JUST
HAD
TO
GET
THAT
OFF
MY
CHEST
DOC
BEM
BENEFIT
OF
A
COMPEE
