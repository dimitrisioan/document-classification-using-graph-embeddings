nah
lets
reserve
recsportsidiots
for
people
who
post
obvious
flamebait
like
yourself
funny
i
didnt
realize
mr
tanner
brought
up
bob
knepper
v
pam
postema
in
the
first
place
thought
it
was
someone
named
jacobs
if
someone
posts
something
as
controversial
not
to
mention
idiotic
as
what
austin
posted
in
a
widely
accessed
newsgroup
someone
should
challenge
the
statement
why
if
a
statement
is
truly
idiotic
and
is
universally
thought
so
the
challenge
is
a
waste
of
panting
further
challenges
that
have
nothing
yes
nothing
to
do
with
baseball
are
wasting
others
time
you
got
a
problem
with
what
bob
knepper
thinks
lets
hear
it
in
some
sort
of
categorical
manner
actually
i
question
whether
either
knepper
or
postema
arent
old
news
at
this
point
although
what
i
have
read
of
postemas
book
is
interesting
there
is
a
school
of
thought
that
suggests
that
silence
consent
i
agree
this
far
whereas
this
idea
may
not
apply
to
everything
in
life
it
certainly
should
apply
to
a
forum
of
public
discussion
sez
you
if
youve
been
reading
rsb
lately
youll
find
that
even
elementary
school
children
have
had
access
to
our
postings
albeit
in
an
edited
form
its
making
me
think
a
little
more
carefully
about
some
of
the
things
i
post
that
does
not
come
out
in
what
you
say
down
the
road
here
in
conclusion
if
someone
like
austin
wants
to
post
his
drivel
in
some
obscure
newsgroup
that
i
dont
read
fine
hes
got
the
right
to
rant
rave
and
drool
all
he
wants
to
in
the
name
of
free
speech
but
if
he
drools
in
a
newsgroup
that
i
read
then
i
will
support
the
right
of
anyone
to
provide
rebuttal
to
his
drooling
yo
even
elementary
school
children
have
had
access
to
our
postings
albeit
in
an
edited
form
you
want
them
to
hear
you
talk
like
this
dont
you
want
people
who
come
to
this
group
to
talk
baseball
to
think
you
like
to
do
the
same
or
do
you
want
them
to
think
youre
some
politically
correct
demagogue
whos
ohso
sensitive
hohum
plus
youre
here
limiting
free
speech
to
some
obscure
newsgroup
that
i
dont
read
what
bs
you
got
a
problem
with
what
jacobs
says
what
knepper
thinks
all
you
have
to
do
is
defeat
it
with
better
ideas
more
and
better
speech
yours
is
the
easy
way
out
as
for
knepper
ever
notice
how
sometimes
these
guys
will
say
just
about
any
darn
thing
that
pops
in
their
heads
when
a
mike
is
shoved
in
front
of
them
you
know
that
often
the
best
copy
for
the
news
is
the
one
that
isnt
preprepared
they
know
knepper
has
controversial
ideas
about
women
they
pop
some
question
about
postema
an
interesting
related
question
would
be
whether
the
two
ever
appeared
in
the
same
game
off
the
top
of
my
head
i
guess
no
if
my
guess
is
right
knepper
popped
off
about
something
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
and
postema
gets
a
book
for
it
and
he
doesnt
now
of
course
you
dont
have
to
read
any
of
this
and
if
you
want
to
cut
down
on
flames
then
dont
post
flamebait
you
dont
have
to
respond
to
flames
either
saves
cyberspace
now
why
didnt
i
think
of
that
rg
i
can
play
me
better
than
anyone
theres
only
one
of
me
barry
bonds
on
playing
himself
in
two
movies
