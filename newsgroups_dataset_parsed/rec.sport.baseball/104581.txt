id
be
willing
to
make
two
wagers
snow
doesnt
win
roy
mattingly
is
out
of
baseball
within
five
years
im
skeptical
of
the
first
because
i
dont
think
snow
is
that
good
a
player
and
he
is
on
a
losing
team
i
dont
have
a
history
handy
but
i
dont
recall
that
the
preponderance
of
roys
come
from
winning
teams
in
fact
i
think
team
performance
is
generally
irrelevant
as
almost
always
the
most
deserving
candidate
wins
am
i
wrong
and
he
is
not
necessarily
on
a
losing
team
while
the
angels
staff
is
still
very
weak
their
everyday
lineup
is
doing
quite
well
thank
you
snow
is
playing
great
salmon
is
learning
to
make
the
adjustments
easley
appears
fine
but
even
if
hes
not
flora
is
ready
to
come
up
between
gonzales
and
gruber
theyll
manage
the
hot
corner
polonia
and
curtis
are
steady
and
heady
even
myers
and
orton
are
contributing
personally
i
think
they
can
finish
over
which
makes
them
a
winning
team
the
beastmaster
im
skeptical
of
the
second
because
of
his
back
mattingly
is
this
year
and
how
many
players
play
until
they
are
not
too
many
and
most
of
them
didnt
have
chronic
back
problems
when
they
were
could
be
wrong
on
either
or
both
but
i
think
thats
the
smart
way
to
bet
