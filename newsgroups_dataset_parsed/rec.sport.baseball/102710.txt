SORT
OF
YOGIS
ASLEEP
IN
A
HOTEL
ROOM
LATE
AT
NIGHT
AND
GETS
A

FROM
SOMEONE

ANSWERS
THE
PHONE

PERSON
AT
THE
OTHER
END

ONE
OF
MY
FAVORITES
CAME
BACK
IN
THE
SEVENTIES
WHEN
TWO
STREAKERS
INTERUPTED
A
GAME
YOGI
WAS
AT
DASHING
ACROSS
THE
FIELD
UNCLAD
LATER
SOMEONE
WHO
WASNT
PRESENT
ASKED
YOGI
IF
THEY
WERE
MEN
OR
WOMEN
HE
REPLIED
I
COULDNT
TELL
THEY
HAD
BAGS
OVER
THEIR
HEADS
