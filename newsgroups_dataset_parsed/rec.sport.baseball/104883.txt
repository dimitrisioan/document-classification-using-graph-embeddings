O
ANY
OF
YOU
EXPERTS
WANT
TO
ANALYZE
RON
GANT
OMEONE
SURE
NEEDS
TO
ANALYZE
HIM
GANT
IS
A
HEAD
CASE
IN
HIS
WHAT
SIX
OR
SEVEN
YEARS
IN
THE
MAJORS
HES
PUT
TOGETHER
A
COMBINED
TOTAL
OF
MAYBE
ONE
GOOD
SEASON
HE
LACKS
SELFCONFIDENCE
BUT
WORSE
HE
DOESNT
REALLY
UNDERSTAND
BASEBALL
CURIOUSLY
HE
SEEMS
TO
PERFORM
BEST
WHEN
HIS
JOB
IS
THREATENED
SIT
HIM
DOWN
FOR
A
GAME
AND
HE
MIGHT
GET
A
HIT
THE
NEXT
NIGHT
BUT
LET
HIM
PLAY
AND
WHAT
IS
HE
THINKING
ABOUT
GETTING
HITS
DRIVING
IN
RUNS
NO
HES
WORRIED
IF
HES
GOING
TO
GET
THAT
STOLEN
BASES
OR
THAT
CAREER
HOME
RUN
HE
APPEARS
TO
HAVE
NO
LEARNING
CURVE
HE
NEVER
FIGURED
OUT
HOW
TO
PLAY
THIRD
BASE
WHAT
A
FIASCO
HE
STILL
PLAYS
THE
OUTFIELD
WITH
HIS
LEGS
HES
LUCKY
HES
SO
FAST
BECAUSE
IT
ENABLES
HIM
TO
OUTRUN
HIS
MISTAKES
BUT
AS
I
SUGGESTED
EARLIER
IN
THE
SEASON
IT
LOOKS
TO
ME
LIKE
HES
SLOWING
DOWN
A
LITTLE
BIT
OR
ELSE
EVERY
GROUNDSKEEPER
IS
WATERING
THE
INFIELD
DIRT
A
LITTLE
EXTRA
GANT
HAS
HAD
WAY
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
CHANCE
ALREADY
HE
MAY
GET
HOT
AGAIN
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
BUT
HELL
ALWAYS
REVERT
TO
HIS
TRUE
LEVEL
GANTS
ML
RECORD
AGE
THIS
SEASON
YEAR
G
AB
BA
OBP

HR
SB
CS
BASE
EXPT
YEAR
IN
THE
MAJORS
FOR
PARTS
OF
SEASONS
TOTAL
PLAYING
TIME
APPROX
SEASONS
JUST
LOOKING
AT
HIS
HITTING
RECORD
HES
HAD
SEASONS
OF
OPS
GREATER
THAN
WHICH
IS
PRETTY
GOOD
FOR
AN
OF
HIS
SEASON
IS
PRETTY
DECENT
FOR
A
ROOKIE
THE
MOVE
TO
THIRD
BASE
EXPLAINS
A
LOT
OF
HIS
WHEN
HE
RETURNED
AS
AN
OF
HE
BEGAN
HITTING
AGAIN
AND
OF
COURSE
LAST
YEAR
HE
SLUMPED
BUT
NO
LEARNING
CURVE
HE
HAS
OBVIOUSLY
IMPROVED
HIS
BATTING
EYE
OVER
THE
YEARS
AS
WELL
AS
HIS
SBCS
RATIO
AS
TO
HIS
FIELDING
HE
WAS
AN
INFIELDER
WHEN
HE
WAS
DRAFTED
A
AS
HE
CAME
UP
THROUGH
THE
BRAVES
SYSTEM
AND
THEN
THE
BRAVES
PUT
HIM
THROUGH
POSITION
CHANGES
IN
THE
SPACE
OF
A
YEAR
HES
AN
ADEQUATE
OF
ALTHOUGH
NOT
GREAT
AND
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
YOUR
PERCEPTION
OF
HIS
FIELDING
IS
COLORED
BY
WATCHING
HIM
LEARN
TO
PLAY
THE
OF
AT
THE
ML
LEVEL
I
KNOW
YOURE
ANOTHER
LONGTERM
BRAVES
FAN
ABOUT
PLAYING
THATS
THE
MOST
DIFFICULT
POSITION
TO
FIELD
AFTER
CATCHER
AT
SS
OR
YOU
NEED
MORE
RANGE
AND
SPEED
BUT
AT
YOUVE
GOT
TO
HAVE
QUICK
REFLEXES
AND
HAVE
A
GUN
FOR
AN
ARM
THERE
ARE
NO
SECOND
CHANCES
AT
EVEN
WHEN
PLAYING
SANDLOT
SOFTBALL
GRANTED
ID
STILL
PUT
MY
BEST
OVERALL
INFIELDER
AT
SS
BUT
THATS
BECAUSE
HE
GETS
MORE
CHANCES
NOT
BECAUSE
THE
JOB
IS
HARDER
IT
STILL
AMAZES
ME
THAT
SO
MANY
TEAMS
HAVE
TRIED
TO
CONVERT
OTHER
POSITION
PLAYERS
TO
BUT
MAYBE
THATS
BECAUSE
THE
SUPPLY
OF
NATURAL
IS
SCARCE
FINALLY
GANT
IS
A
PLAYER
WHO
PUTS
PRESSURE
ON
HIMSELF
TO
PERFORM
WELL
AND
WORKS
HARD
TO
IMPROVE
YOU
DONT
GET
THOSE
AMAZINGLY
HUGE
ARMS
ON
THAT
RELATIVELY
SMALL
BODY
WITHOUT
A
LOT
OF
WEIGHT
WORK
NOW
WHETHER
HES
BEEN
OVERDOING
IT
THESE
DAYS
MAY
BE
A
VALID
QUESTION
AS
IS
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
HE
TRIES
TOO
HARD
TO
MAKE
SOMETHING
HAPPEN
DURING
EACH
ATBAT
BUT
FRANKLY
IF
A
PLAYER
IS
GOING
TO
NOT
LIVE
UP
TO
POTENTIAL
ID
MUCH
RATHER
THEY
FAIL
BY
TRYING
TOO
HARD
THAN
BY
NOT
TRYING
HARD
ENOUGH
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
TEACH
RELAXATION
TO
AN
ADULT
BUT
AT
THAT
AGE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
YOU
CAN
TEACH
HUSTLE
ALL
THAT
SAID
I
DONT
THINK
ID
SIGN
GANT
TO
ANOTHER
LONGTERM
CONTRACT
HES
NOW
AND
I
THINK
HES
FREEAGENT
ELIGIBLE
IN
YEARS
WHEN
HELL
BE
GIVEN
HIS
CAREER
CURVE
AND
LIMITATIONS
I
WOULDNT
EXPECT
HIM
TO
LAST
MUCH
PAST
AS
A
ML
BALLPLAYER
HE
MIGHT
SURPRISE
ME
HERE
BUT
ATLANTAS
GOT
SOME
TALENT
ON
THE
FARM
AND
ID
RATHER
TAKE
MY
CHANCES
DOWN
THE
ROAD
WITH
NIEVES
ET
AL
ERIC
