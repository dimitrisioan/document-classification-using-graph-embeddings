re

update
i
sent
a
version
of
this
post
out

it
was
swallowed
by
the
void

apologies

anyone
ends
up
receiving
it

i
just
dont
happen
to
think
that
the
minutes
added
to
the
length
of
games
over
the
last
years
has
added
anything
interesting
how
would
you
quantify
that
i
suppose
an
easy
way
would
be
to
look
at
attendance
figures
anyone
got
the
numbers
attendance
figures
arent
going
to
quantify
anything
about
my
personal
opinion
which
the
above
is
clearly
stated
as
add
to
me
to
the
end
of
my
sentence
if
youre
confused
about
what
i
meant
oh
no
i
wasnt
confused
i
understood
that
it
was
your
personal
opinion
but
i
thought
we
were
discussing
the
need
to
shorten
games
the
arguments
which
declare
this
need
seem
to
hinge
on
the
assertion
that
long
games
bore
people
and
otherwise
discourage
them
from
going
to
the
ballpark
id
like
to
see
if
the
increased
length
of
games
has
negatively
affected
attendance
if
it
has
then
there
is
a
problem
and
something
should
be
done
about
it
if
it
hasnt
then
there
isnt
a
problem
and
theres
no
need
to
monkey
with
things
as
they
are
