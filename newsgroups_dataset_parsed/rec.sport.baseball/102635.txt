geez
everyone
comes
up
with
clark
williams
thompson
these
guys
were
all
up
in
thats
ancient
history
so
in
the
last
years
noone
right
beck
doesnt
count
i
said
solid
years
btw
manwaring
lead
the
ml
last
season
in
throwing
out
baserunners
he
is
an
excellent
defensive
catcher
i
agree
that
his
offensive
skills
are
limited
but
he
does
seem
to
be
improving
on
them
lets
see
what
he
does
wo
the
help
of
a
pitchout
every
other
pitch
as
i
remember
even
bob
brenly
had
a
good
throwout
percentage
under
roger
craig
who
loved
to
sacrifice
the
count
for
runners
being
thrown
out
of
course
he
suffered
from
ball
strike
homers
a
lot
too
i
am
not
a
big
fan
of
manwaring
