PLAYER
RATING
BOOK
DAVE
THIS
HAS
NEVER
HAPPENED
TO
ME
BEFORE
KIRSCH
WRITES
CORRECTION
NIED
WAS
THE
ONLY
PLAYER
IDENTIFIED
IN
THIS
BOOK
AS
A
GRADE
A
PROSPECT
WHO
WAS
EXPOSED
TO
THE
DRAFT
ACCORDING
TO
BILL
JAMES
IN
THE
STOP
THE
PRESSES
SECTION
PRECEDING
HIS
PLAYER
EVALUATIONS
HE
VALUED
NIED
AT
AND
SAID
THAT
NIEDS
VALUE
DOES
NOT
INCREASE
SIGNIFICANTLY
AS
A
RESULT
OF
HIS
SELECTION
ALTHOUGH
HE
DID
CATCH
A
BREAK
GETTING
AWAY
FROM
THE
STRONGEST
ROTATION
IN
BASEBALL
I
THOUGHT
BILL
JAMES
LATEST
BOOK
COMPLETELY
AND
TOTALLY
SUCKED
I
BOUGHT
IT
BUT
WILL
NOT
PURCHASE
ANYTHING
OF
HIS
EVER
AGAIN
WITHOUT
THOROUGHLY
LOOKING
AT
IT
FIRST
WHAT
TRIPE
THE
BOOK
IS
INCONSISTENT
AND
FILLED
WITH
SELECTIVE
ANALYSIS
JAMES
CLAIMS
TO
BE
LOOKING
FORWARD
AND
THEN
MAKES
SOME
ABSOLUTELY
BIZARRE
STATEMENTS
OF
VALUE
NOT
ONLY
THAT
BUT
I
GOT
THE
IMPRESSION
HE
PROBABLY
GLANCED
AT
THE
BOOK
FOR
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
BEFORE
HE
PUT
HIS
NAME
ON
IT
TO
SAY
I
WAS
DISAPPOINTED
IS
A
GRAND
UNDERSTATEMENT
GARY

THERES
ANYTHING
WE
LOVE
