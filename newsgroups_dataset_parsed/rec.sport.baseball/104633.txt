jays
line
up
lately
does
anybody
know
why
he
is
not
playing
during
one
of
the
games
last
week
wednesday
both
white
and
sprauge
were
not
playing
because
they
had
the
flu
i
guess
white
is
probably
still
sick
i
hope
white
gets
back
in
the
lineup
soon
watching
darrin
jackson
play
center
is
painful

abdominal
muscle
or

like
that
