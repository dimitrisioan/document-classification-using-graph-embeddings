yankee
bullpen
help
buck
showalter
just
cant
win
bob
wickmans
pitching
the
game
of
his
life
through
eight
innings
yanks
lead
so
buck
decides
to
let
the
kid
try
and
get
his
first
complete
game
wickman
manages
to
get
two
outs
but
in
between
four
funs
score
and
all
of
a
sudden
its
and
wickman
just
cant
get
the
third
out
so
buck
goes
to
the
bullpen
and
farr
gets
out
the
first
guy
he
faces
last
night
jimmy
key
is
pitching
another
in
a
long
string
of
games
of
his
life
this
guy
just
keeps
getting
better
through
eight
innings
yanks
lead
this
time
buck
thinks
i
dont
want
a
repeat
of
that
nearfiasco
with
wickman
so
ill
give
my
bullpen
some
work
steve
howe
whose
era
was
coming
into
the
game
left
with
it
at
he
didnt
do
too
good
then
farr
comes
in
he
gives
up
a
tworun
homer
and
the
royals
win
it
whats
going
on
this
is
already
the
third
or
fourth
time
this
year
that
the
bullpen
has
blown
a
lead
farr
howe
have
done
it
twice
together
monteleones
done
it
once
and
i
think
even
habyan
did
it
once
whats
the
deal
we
finally
have
terrific
starting
pitching
so
all
of
a
sudden
our
bullpen
turns
to
shit
whats
buck
gonna
do
and
whats
george
gonna
do
if
this
continues
