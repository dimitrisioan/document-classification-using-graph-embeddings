LOOSCUPHPCOM
JOE
LOOS
WRITES
IVE
BEEN
FOLLOWING
THE
GIANTS
CLOSELY
OVER
THE
OFFSEASON
NEWSPAPERS
NOTESGROUP
ETC
BUT
I
HAD
MY
FIRST
UP
CLOSE
AND
PERSONAL
LAST
NIGHT
AT
THE
STICK
AFTER
WATCHING
GIANTS
HITTERS
STRUGGLE
LAST
YEAR
BARRYS
SWING
WAS
VERY
IMPRESSIVE
HES
VERY
QUICK
AND
HIS
SWING
SEEMS
EFFORTLESS
EVEN
COMPARED
TO
CLARK
PARTICULARLY
CLARK
AS
OF
LATE
IT
WAS
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
BONDS
HIT
MADDUX
SO
WELL
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
BARRY
WAS
AFTER
REVENGE
AGAINST
THE
BRAVES
OR
WHAT
BUT
HE
STROKED
THREE
VERY
PRETTY
HITS
HR
FOR
RBIS
THE
GIANTS
ALWAYS
HIT
MADDUX
WELL
BUT
IT
WAS
INTERESTING
THAT
MADDUX
DID
NOT
PITCH
AROUND
BONDS
TO
GET
TO
CLAYTON
LAST
NIGHT
HE
THREW
STRAIGHT
FASTBALLS
OVER
THE
PLATE
TO
BONDS
IN
THE
LAST
NIGHT
GOT
AWAY
WITH
THE
FIRST
ONE
BUT
BONDS
HIT
THE
SECOND
ONE
OUT
OF
THE
PARK
THEN
IN
THE
WHEN
CLARK
WAS
AT
THIRD
BASE
WITH
ONE
OUT
MADDUX
DID
NOT
INTENTIONALLY
WALK
BONDS
AND
BONDS
DROPPED
A
SINGLE
TO
LEFTCENTER
THE
GIANTS
AS
A
TEAM
ARE
DOING
A
LOT
OF
SURPRISING
THINGS
THIS
YEAR
IN
ADDITION
TO
BONDS
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
GOOD
PITCHING
AND
SOME
HITTERS
SEEM
TO
BE
SWINGING
MUCH
BETTER
CLAYTONS
DEFENSE
HAS
BEEN
SUPERB
MCGEE
SEEMS
TO
LIKE
LEADING
OFF
THIS
YEAR
MANWARING
IS
DRIVING
THE
BALL
SO
ON
SO
FORTH
THE
BRAVES
ANNOUNCERS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
MCGEE
AS
A
LEADOFF
HITTER
HAS
NOT
SCORED
A
RUN
YET
HE
WILL
ALWAYS
HIT
AROUND
BUT
IM
CONCERNING
ABOUT
HIS
ONBASE
PERCENTAGE
THE
KEY
IN
THE
LINEUP
IS
MATT
WILLIAMS
HE
HAS
TO
STAY
HOT
SO
THAT
BONDS
CAN
HIT
WITH
RUNNERS
ON
BASE
I
HOPE
IT
CONTINUESI
THINK
THEY
NEED
TO
CONTINUE
WELL
INTO
JUNE
BEFORE
PEOPLE
ARE
REALLY
SOLD
THAT
THEY
ARE
FOR
REALPARTICULARLY
THE
PITCHING
THE
PITCHING
GETS
A
SET
BACK
AS
BUD
BLACK
IS
PLACED
ON
THE
DL
BURBA
HAS
DONE
A
SUPERB
JOB
FILLING
IN
SO
FAR
HE
LOOKS
LIKE
A
DIFFERENT
PITCHER
FROM
LAST
YEAR
HOWEVER
SWIFT
IS
TERRIBLE
IN
BOTH
OF
HIS
STARTS
WITH
BURBA
MOVING
INTO
THE
ROTATION
MIKE
JACKSON
IS
THE
ONLY
RIGHTHANDED
RELIEVER
ASIDE
FROM
ROD
BECK
HELL
GET
A
LOT
OF
ACTIONS
I
ALSO
HOPE
THAT
DUSTY
CAN
MANAGE
HIS
BULLPEN
BETTER
THAN
ROGER
CRAIG
ESPECIALLY
ON
BECK
I
WAS
CONCERNED
WHEN
BECK
WAS
USED
FOR
STRAIGHT
DAYS
EARLIER
THIS
WEEK
FOR
MYSELF
I
THINK
THE
FRESH
START
OF
MAGOWANBAKERETC
HAS
REALLY
WIPED
OUT
A
LOT
OF
NEGATIVES
FROM
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
AND
WILL
BE
A
REAL
FACTOR
IN
HELPING
THEM
SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPROVE
OVER
LAST
YEAR
SO
FAR
SO
GOOD
