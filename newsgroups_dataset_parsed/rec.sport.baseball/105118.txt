rule
states
it
is
interference
by
a
batter
or
runner
when
in
running
the
last
half
of
the
distance
from
home
base
to
first
base
he
runs
outside
the
threefoot
line
or
inside
to
the
left
of
the
foul
line
and
in
the
umpires
judgment
interferes
with
the
field
er
taking
the
throw
at
first
base
the
key
word
in
the
rule
is
and
a
runner
isnt
out
just
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
hes
out
for
interfering
with
the
fielding
of
the
ball
or
throw
or
fielding
of
the
throw
to
first
because
the
catcher
opted
to
throw
the
ball
over
the
batterrunners
head
theres
no
inter
ference
sorry
i
still
dont
buy
it
youre
certainly
right
that
the
runner
is
not
out
merely
for
running
out
of
the
baseline
he
must
interfere
with
the
play
but
the
argument
here
is
over
what
constitutes
interference
you
certainly
cannot
infer
from
what
youve
quoted
that
the
batterrunner
must
be
hit
by
the
ball
to
be
guilty
of
interference
you
havent
posted
a
definition
of
interference
at
all
imo
this
calls
for
one
of
the
approved
rulings
that
go
in
small
print
in
the
rulebook
something
like
approved
ruling
if
in
the
judgement
of
the
umpire
the
runner
by
running
to
the
left
of
the
allowed
path
caused
the
fielder
to
make
a
bad
throw
blocks
the
vision
of
the
fielder
receiving
the
throw
or
otherwise
impedes
the
defensive
teams
making
a
play
on
him
the
batterrunner
shall
be
judeged
guilty
of
interference
or
approved
ruling
the
runner
cannot
be
judged
guilty
of
interference
in
the
unless
he
makes
contact
with
a
fielder
or
is
hit
by
the
thrown
ball
in
the
absence
of
such
an
approved
ruling
i
claim
that
this
is
a
poor
