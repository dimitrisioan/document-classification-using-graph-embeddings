ZANERESCUE
US
FROM
SIMMONS
SO
FAR
SIMMONS
LOOKS
LIKE
A
TOTAL
IDIOT
ZANE
SMITH
SHOULD
LEARN
HOW
TO
SWITCHPITCH
AND
RETURN
FROM
THE
DL
I
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
ZANE
SMITH
PITCH
RIGHT
HANDED
THAN
HAVE
MOELLER
PITCH
AT
ALL
I
AM
SURE
SIMMONS
WAS
READY
TO
SAY
I
TOLD
YOU
SO
AFTER
OTTO
HAD
AN
IMPRESSIVE
WIN
LAST
WEEK
NOW
OTTOS
LATEST
DEBACLE
HAS
RESTORED
SIMMONS
REPUTATION
NOW
HE
LOOKS
LIKE
HE
IS
BACK
IN
HIS
FORM
WHEN
HE
HAD
THE
ALS
HIGHEST
ERA
AMONG
STARTERS
FOUR
OUR
SAKENOT
TEDS
SAKE
I
HOPE
HE
PITCHES
WITH
A
ERA
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
SEASON
YEAH
RIGHT
TOMLIN
AND
MERCED
ARE
A
BIT
DISAPPOINTING
THEY
ARE
STILL
DOING
DECENTLY
BUT
CONSIDERING
THE
CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
TALENT
AND
MATURITY
THEY
HAVE
SHOWN
THEIR
FIRST
SEASONS
THEY
SEEM
TO
HAVE
ACTUALLY
GOTTEN
A
LITTLE
BIT
WORSE
TOMLIN
WAS
ALMOST
UNHITTABLE
HIS
ROOKIE
YEAR
AGAINST
LEFTY
BATTERS
MERCED
HAD
A
VERY
GOOD
OBA
HIS
ROOKIE
YEAR
HE
SHOWED
A
LOT
OF
CONCENTRATION
AT
THE
PLATE
IN
HIS
ROOKIE
YEAR
WALK
WELL
HE
SEEMS
TO
BE
ON
THE
LOSING
END
TONIGHT
BUT
I
STILL
THINK
THAT
WALK
DESRVED
HIS
CONTRACT
LEYLAND
SHOULD
ACCEPT
A
PART
OF
THE
BLAME
FOR
THE
LAVALLIERE
SITUATION
I
CANT
UNDERSTAND
HIS
AND
MANAGEMENTS
FEAR
OF
LOSING
TOM
PRINCE
THROUGH
WAIVERS
EVEN
IF
THEY
DO
WHATS
THE
USE
HE
IS
ARIGHT
HANDER
LIKE
SLAUGHT
NOT
A
VERY
SMART
PLATOON
ALSO
I
AM
BLAMING
LEYLAND
IN
THIS
CASE
SINCE
HE
IS
HCURRENTLY
CONVINCED
THAT
LAVALLIERE
IS
THROUGH
WHILE
GIVING
HIM
WAY
TOO
MUCH
TIME
LAST
YEAR
IN
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
AND
THE
PLAYOFFSSLAUGHT
SHOULD
HAVE
PLAYED
IN
ALL
GAMES
HE
HAS
A
GOOD
AVERAGE
AGAINST
RIGHT
HANDED
PITCHING
DIDNT
LEYLAND
AND
SIMMONS
FORSEE
THIS
LAST
YEAR
AND
ATTEMPT
TO
TRADE
LAVALLIERE
LAST
YEAR
ITSELF
ANY
FOOL
COULD
TELL
THEM
LAVALLIERE
WASNT
VERY
FIT
LAST
YEAR
DENNIS
MOELLER
IS
SCARY
CANDELERIA
WELL
HE
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
HAVE
SUCH
A
HIGH
ERA
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
MAYBE
IT
WILL
BE
IN
RANGE
BUT
MILLION
PLUS
COME
ON
OTHER
THAN
THE
CUSTOMARY
HOME
RUN
GIVING
STAGE
PATTERSON
GOES
THROUGH
FOR
A
FEW
WEEKS
PATTERSON
HAS
SERVED
THE
PIRATES
VERY
WELL
EACH
YEAR
SO
FAR
HE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
PITCHED
WELL
FOR
THE
RANGERS
I
THINK
THE
PIRATES
SHOULD
HAVE
SPENT
THE
MONEY
ON
PATTERSON
IN
STEAD
THE
ROOKIE
BATTERS
WELL
YOUNG
HAS
SURPRISED
ME
A
BIT
WITH
HIS
INSTANT
IMPACT
OTHER
THAN
THAT
THEIR
EXCELLENT
PERFORMANCE
HASNT
BEEN
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
SURPRISE
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
THANK
DOUGHTY
FOR
THAT
ROOKIE
PITCHERS
WORSE
THAN
EXPECTED
ESPECIALLY
COOKE
SLAUGHT
HOW
COME
HE
WASNT
GIVEN
A
CONTRACT
EXTENSION
LAST
YEAR
NOW
HIS
VALUE
HAS
INCREASED
IMMENSELY
LONNIE
SMITH
WELL
ERIC
DAVIS
WAS
SIGNED
FOR
A
COMPARABLE
AMOUNT
LETS
SEE
ERIC
CAN
HIT
BETTER
HE
CAN
RUN
BETTER
HE
CAN
FIELD
BETTER
NOW
WHY
DIDNT
THE
PIRATES
GO
AFTER
ERIC
DAVIS
AN
INJURED
DAVIS
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
HEALTHY
LONNIE
SMITH
EVEN
IF
LONNNIE
SMITH
GETS
SOME
BIG
HITS
THIS
YEARHE
WONT
BE
AN
ASSET
HE
HAS
LOOKED
TERRIBLE
ON
THE
BASES
AND
IN
THE
FIELD
MANAGEMENT
BIG
BIG
ZERO
SAUER
HAS
YET
TO
MAKE
A
FORCEFUL
AGREEMENT
IN
FAVOR
OF
REVENUE
SHARING
HE
SEEMS
MORE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
PLEASING
THAT
IDIOT
DANFORTH
BY
PREPARING
THE
TEAM
FOR
A
MOVE
TO
TAMPA
BAY
ALEX
COLE
FIASCO
THE
PIRATES
INFIELD
AND
CF
POSITIONS
LOOK
GOOD
THE
RF
AND
LF
WOULD
HAVE
LOOKED
GOOD
IF
WE
COULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
COLE
TO
REPLACE
TWO
OF
THE
FOUR
OUTFIELDERS
ERIC
DAVIS
VAN
SLYKE
AND
COLE
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
A
VERY
RESPECTABLE
OUTFIELD
EVEN
WITHOUT
ERIC
DAVIS
THYE
PIRATES
WOULD
HAVE
A
RESPECTABLE
OUTFIELD
WITH
COLE
SVAN
SLYKE
AND
MERCEDI
THINK
HE
SHOULD
HIT
LEFT
HANDED
AGAINST
LEFTS
IN
STEAD
OF
SWITCH
HITTING
SIMMONS
DID
HAVE
OPTIONS
FOR
THE
OUTFIELD
IRONICALLY
THE
BIGGEST
ACCOMPLISHMENT
OF
SIMMONS
TENURE
WAS
GETTING
ALEX
COLE
REALLY
CHEAP
TOO
BAD
COMPENSATORY
DRAFT
PICKS
FOR
BONDS
FORGET
IT
THE
PIRATES
CAN
RANT
AND
RAVE
THEY
WILL
NOT
GET
THOSE
PICKS
AS
OF
NOW
THE
ISSUE
IS
STILL
BEING
APPEALED
NOW
IF
THIS
DOESNT
CONVINCE
ANYONE
THAT
SIMMONS
AND
SAUER
ARE
IDIOTS
NOTHING
ELSE
WILL
ON
A
FINAL
NOTE
TIM
WAKEFIELD
WONT
BE
AS
AWFUL
AS
HE
WAS
IN
HIS
LAST
STARTS
BUT
DONT
COUNT
ON
HIM
PITCHING
LIKE
LAST
YEAR
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
SEASON
ALSO
IF
THE
PIRATES
ARE
IN
CONTENTION
TOWARDS
RTHE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
THEY
WILL
MISS
REDUSS
CLUTCH
HITTING
AND
HIS
SPEEDHE
HAS
PEAKED
IN
THE
SECOND
HALF
OF
THE
LAST
SEASONS
PRAVIN
RATNAM
