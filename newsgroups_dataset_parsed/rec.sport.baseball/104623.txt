SO
YOU
WANT
TO
DECREASE
PLAYERS
SALARIES
SO
YOU
WANT
TO
INCREASE
OWNERS
SALARIES
THE
TWO
ARE
EQUIVALENT
BOB
VESTERMAN
ONLY

YOU
INSIST
THAT
THE
TICKET
PRICES
CANNOT

FOR
THE

THE
BALLPARKS
OR

OR

OWNERS
DECREASE
TICKET
PRICES
WHEN

THE
LOCAL
COMMUNITY
OR
MERCHINDISE
COULD
MAKE
UP
THE
DIFFERENCE
BASEBALL
IS
PROBABLY
FACING
A
DRAMATIC
DROP
IN
INCOME
VERY
SOON
AND
SOMEONE
WILL
SUFFER
PROBABLY
THE
FANS
FROM
HIGHER
TICKET
PRICES
BUT
DEFINITELY
SOMEONE
