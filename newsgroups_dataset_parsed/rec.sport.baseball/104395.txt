scores
deleted
at
just
that
exact
time
to
see
the
message
even
results
after
the
game
is
over
are
not
necessary
thanks
to
mr
hernandez
who
posts
daily
standings
and
results
here
every
day
am
i
supposed
to
take
that
as
a
compliment
or
a
put
down
just
wondering
i
do
this
as
a
service
to
the
entire
baseball
world
on
usenet
especially
for
those
in
the
east
coast
who
cant
get
final
scores
for
west
coast
games
in
their
newspapers
or
late
tv
newscasts
this
is
helpful
to
fans
in
other
countries
who
either
receive
only
weekly
scores
or
updates
by
the
week
also
many
have
requested
for
this
kind
of
service
previously
but
it
was
only
available
through
bbss
or
some
pay
news
services
by
the
way
mine
is
free
of
charge
and
has
no
copyright
restrictions
if
you
want
to
send
updates
and
scores
set
up
a
private
mailing
list
and
use
that
remember
i
only
post
final
scores
and
the
updated
standings
once
a
day
to
the
recsportbaseball
newsgroup
other
than
that
everything
is
done
through
private
email
currently
there
are
people
on
my
mailing
list
that
branches
off
into
other
mailing
lists
available
for
many
others
and
the
list
grows
by
an
average
of
people
a
day
if
people
on
usenet
really
dont
want
to
see
the
postings
i
do
to
recsportbaseball
on
a
daily
basis
please
just
let
me
know
if
the
response
is
overwhelming
against
the
posts
i
wont
do
it
anymore
thanks
for
your
time
