ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
IN
DAVID
ROBERT
WALKER
WRITES
SOME
COMMENTS
DELETED
FOR
BANDWIDTH
GOD
KNOWS
WE
NEED
IT
BASEBALL
IS
A
TEAM
GAME
BUT
IT
IS
MADE
OF
INDIVIDUAL
TALENTS
IT
IS
ABSURD
TO
JUDGE
THE
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
BY
THE
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
OF
HIS
TEAMMATES
WHOM
HE
DID
NOT
CHOOSE
AT
LEAST
IN
MOST
CASES
MORRIS
WON
LAST
YEAR
BECAUSE
HE
PLAYED
ON
A
TEAM
WITH
JOE
CARTER
ROBBY
ALOMAR
TOM
HENKE
JUAN
GUZMAN
JOHN
OLERUD
ET
AL
CLEMENS
LOST
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
SURROUNDED
BY
SUCH
LESSER
PERFORMERS
AS
HERM
WINNINHAM
LUIS
RIVERA
AND
JEFF
REARDON
TO
DEFINE
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
TEAM
AS
A
SUM
OF
ITS
COMPONENTS
AS
I
DO
ALBEIT
IMPERFECTLY
IS
A
LESSER
ERROR
THAN
DEFINING
THE
QUALITY
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
AS
THE
MEAN
QUALITY
OF
THE
TEAM
AS
MY
READING
OF
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
SUGGESTS
YOU
DO
NO
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
DEFINE
THE
QUALITY
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
AT
LEAST
NOT
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
RANKING
THEM
TORONTO
WON
WITH
OLERUD
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
WON
WITH
FIELDER
THEY
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
WON
WITH
THOMAS
DETROIT
MIGHT
HAVE
WON
WITH
THOMAS
CHICAGO
MIGHT
HAVE
WON
WITH
FIELDER
YOU
CANT
RANK
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
YOU
CAN
ONLY
LOOK
AT
WHO
MIGHT
CONTRIBUTE
MORE
TO
THE
TEAM
EFFORT
WHICH
IS
WINNING
THE
WS
THOMAS
COULD
NOT
HAVE
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THAT
GOAL
ANY
MORE
THAN
OLERUD
SO
I
CANNOT
SAY
THAT
OLERUD
IS
LESS
OF
A
PLAYER
OK
ROGER
HERES
A
QUESTION
FOR
YOU
SAY
YOU
ARE
RUNNING
AN
EXPANSION
TEAM
YOU
DONT
HAVE
A
TEAM
AT
THE
MOMENT
BUT
THE
DRAFT
IS
COMING
UP
WHO
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
PICK
GUYS
WHO
HAVE
WON
THE
MOST
WS
RINGS
OR
GUYS
WHO
COULD
CONTRIBUTE
THE
MOST
TO
YOUR
TEAM
SAY
THE
REDS
WERE
DUMB
ENOUGH
TO
NOT
PROTECT
LARKIN
AND
THE
JAYS
DIDNT
PROTECT
ALFREDO
WHO
WOULD
YOU
PICK
I
CANT
BELIEVE
IM
GETTING
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
JOHN
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
SO
MANY
MORONS
RM
AND
SO
LITTLE
TIME
