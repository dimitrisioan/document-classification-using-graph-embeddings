RE
DAVE
KINGMAN
FOR
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
STEVE
TOMASSI
WRITES
HI
BASEBALL
FANS
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
SAY
DONT
YOU
THINK
HE
DESERVES
IT
I
MEAN
HECK
IF
DAVE
WINFIELD
HOHUM
IS
SERIOUSLY
BEING
CONSIDERED
FOR
IT
AS
IS
LEE
SMITH
HA
THEN
WHY
DONT
WE
GIVE
DAVE
KINGMAN
A
CHANCE
OR
DARRELL
EVANS
YEAH
YEAH
AFTER
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
TAKES
IN
THEM
IT
CAN
TAKE
IN
EDDIE
MURRAY
AND
JEFF
REARDON
UNFORTUNATELY
YOU
SEEM
TO
LACK
THE
ABILITY
TO
RATE
PLAYERS
DAVE
WINFIELD
HAS
HAD
A
BETTER
CAREER
THAN
HALF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
EDDIE
MURRAY
AND
DARREL
EVANS
ARE
BOTH
ONE
OF
THE
TOP
PLAYERS
OF
ALL
TIME
LEE
SMITH
HAS
HAD
PROBABLY
THE
GREATEST
LONG
CAREER
OF
ANY
RELIEF
PITCHER
SINCE
WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
EXCEPTION
OF
GOSSAGE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
KINGMAN
PROBABLY
ISNT
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
PLAYERS
OF
ALL
TIME
AND
REARDON
THOUGH
A
GOOD
PITCHER
ISNT
IN
SMITHS
CLASS
CAREER
WISE
WELL
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
SICK
AND
TIRED
MOSTLY
SICK
OF
EVERYBODY
GIVING
HALL
OF
FAME
CONSIDERATION
TO
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
BY
TODAYS
STANDARDS
MARGINAL
HONESTLY
OZZIE
SMITH
AND
ROBIN
YOUNT
DONT
BELONG
THERE
THEYRE
BOTH
SHORTSTOPS
THAT
JUST
HUNG
AROUND
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BIG
DEAL
WERE
TALKING
OF
THE
TOP
PLAYERS
OF
ALL
TIME
HERE
THERE
PROBABLY
ARENT
SHORTSTOPS
IN
HISTORY
WHO
WERE
BETTER
THAN
THESE
TWO
LETS
BE
A
LITTLE
MORE
SELECTIVE
HUH
STOP
HANDING
OUT
THESE
HONORS
SO
LIBERALLY
SAVE
THEM
FOR
THE
GUYS
WHO
REALLY
DESERVE
IT
FACE
IT
IF
SOMETHING
ISNT
DONE
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
PRESTIGE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
ANYMORE
WHEN
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUALS
BELIEVE
THAT
STEVE
GARVEY
OR
JACK
MORRIS
ARE
POTENTIAL
CANDIDATES
THE
ABSURDITY
IS
APPARENT
GARVEY
SUCKED
MORRIS
WHILE
A
VERY
GOOD
PITCHER
SIMPLY
DOESNT
BELONG
NEAR
COOPERSTOWN
GEE
CAN
THESE
GUYS
EVEN
COMPARE
TO
THE
MORE
LIKELY
FUTURE
HALL
OF
FAMERS
LIKE
KIRBY
PUCKETT
OR
NOLAN
RYAN
IF
PUCKETT
AND
RYAN
OKAY
NO
IF
THERE
GET
INTO
TO
THE
HALL
THEY
WILL
BE
MARGINAL
HALL
OF
FAMERS
UNLESS
PUCKETT
KEEPS
HITTING
LIKE
HE
DID
LAST
YEAR
FOR
A
WHILE
LONGER
TO
PUT
THIS
IN
PERSPECTIVE
HERES
A
LISTING
OF
THE
LINEAR
WEIGHTS
VALUES
OF
THE
CAREERS
OF
THE
PLAYERS
YOU
MENTION
IN
PARENTHESIS
IS
HOW
HIGH
THEY
ARE
UP
ON
THE
GREATEST
EVER
LIST
IF
THEY
MAKE
IT
WHILE
NO
ONE
WOULD
CLAIM
THESE
ARE
PERFECT
RANKINGS
THEY
SHOULD
GIVE
YOU
A
GOOD
VALUE
OF
THESE
GUYS
CAREERS
AS
COMPARED
TO
AVERAGE
PLAYERS
ROBIN
YOUNT
OZZIE
SMITH
DAVE
WINFIELD
EDDIE
MURRAY
DARREL
EVANS
KIRBY
PUCKETT
NOLAN
RYAN
JACK
MORRIS
DAVE
KINGMAN
STEVE
GARVEY
TO
GIVE
YOU
AN
IDEA
OF
HOW
THESE
NUMBERS
COMPARE
TO
THOSE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
THE
ELIGIBLE
PLAYERS
WHOSE
CAREER
STATS
EQUALED
ARE
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
THE
ONES
WHO
ARENT
INCLUDE
CENTURY
PLAYERS
RON
SANTO
BOBBY
GRICH
AND
BOB
JOHNSON
OF
THOSE
ELIGIBLE
WHO
SCORE
BETWEEN
AND
