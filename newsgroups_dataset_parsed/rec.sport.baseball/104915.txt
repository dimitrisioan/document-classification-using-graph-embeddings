SAY
YOU
COULD
MAKE
A
GOOD
FOR
THEM
BEING
ABOUT
EQUAL
RIGHT
NOW
TP
RATED
BAERGA
HIGHER
ACTUALLY
FINALLY
AN
OBJECTIVE
SOURCE
ALOMARS
A
GREAT
PLAYER
BUT
SO
IS
BAERGA
NICE
TO
SEE
THE
OBJECTIVE
SOURCE
CITED
RATHER
THAN
MY
DADS
BIGGER
THAN
YOUR
DAD
POSTS
I
KNOW
YOU
HAVE
THIS
FUCKED
UP
IDEA
THAT
ANYBODY
WHO
PREFERS
ALOMAR
TO
BAERGA
MUST
BE
A
JAYLOVER
AND
INDIANHATER
SORRY
YOU
GOT
THAT
ONE
WRONG
I
HATE
THE
JAYS
AND
DONT
CARE
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
ABOUT
THE
INDIANS
BUT
OBJECTIVELY
ALOMAR
HAD
THE
BETTER
OFFENSIVE
YEAR
LAST
YEAR
SO
I
HAVE
TO
PICK
HIM
YOU
ADMIT
TP
AS
A
RELIABLE
OBJECTIVE
SOURCE
THEN
YOU
WILL
NOTE
THAT
THEY
RATED
ALOMAR
AS
THE
BETTER
OFFENSIVE
PLAYER
CHOSING
BAERGA
OVER
ALOMAR
ONLY
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
DEFENSE
THATS
A
JOKE
ALOMAR
MIGHT
NOT
BE
A
GOLDGLOVER
BUT
HES
CERTAINLY
NO
WORSE
THAN
BAERGA
DEFENSIVELY
VALENTINE
