say
you
could
make
a
good
for
them
being
about
equal
right
now
tp
rated
baerga
higher
actually
finally
an
objective
source
alomars
a
great
player
but
so
is
baerga
nice
to
see
the
objective
source
cited
rather
than
my
dads
bigger
than
your
dad
posts
i
know
you
have
this
fucked
up
idea
that
anybody
who
prefers
alomar
to
baerga
must
be
a
jaylover
and
indianhater
sorry
you
got
that
one
wrong
i
hate
the
jays
and
dont
care
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
indians
but
objectively
alomar
had
the
better
offensive
year
last
year
so
i
have
to
pick
him
you
admit
tp
as
a
reliable
objective
source
then
you
will
note
that
they
rated
alomar
as
the
better
offensive
player
chosing
baerga
over
alomar
only
because
of
his
defense
thats
a
joke
alomar
might
not
be
a
goldglover
but
hes
certainly
no
worse
than
baerga
defensively
