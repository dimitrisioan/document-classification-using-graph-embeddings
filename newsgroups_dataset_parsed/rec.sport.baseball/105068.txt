DOES

GET

WRITES
THE
SUBJECT
LINE
SAYS
IT
ALL
WHAT
IS
THE
RULE
THAT
QUALIFIES
A
PITCHER
AS
MAKING
A
SAVE
IMHO
THIS
IS
THE
MOST
UNTRUSTWORTHY
SILLY
STAT
BY
TODAYS
RULES
IN
ALL
OF
BASEBALL
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
TO
QUALIFY
AS
A
SAVE
A
PITCHER
CANNOT
PITCH
MORE
THAN
THREE
INNINGS
AND
THE
POTENTIAL
TYING
RUN
MUST
AT
LEAST
APPEAR
IN
THE
ONDECK
CIRCLE
ALSO
THE
LEAD
A
PITCHER
ENTERS
WITH
CANNOT
EXCEDE
THREE
RUNS
THIS
IS
A
PHENOMENON
KNOWN
AROUND
WORK
AS
READYFIREAIM
I
AM
ASTOUNDED
AT
THE
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
PEOPLE
POST
STRONG
OPINIONS
ABOUT
THINGS
THEY
NOT
ONLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
BUT
PUBLICLY
ADMIT
TO
NOT
UNDERSTANDING
IN
FACT
THERES
A
PLAUSIBLE
ARGUMENT
THAT
SAVES
ARE
A
MORE
RATIONAL
STAT
THAN
WINS
FOR
THE
RECORD
THERE
ARE
TWO
WAYS
THAT
A
RELIEVER
CAN
GET
A
SAVE
HE
MUST
FINISH
THE
GAME
AND
EITHER
HAVE
ENTERED
THE
GAME
WITH
THE
TYING
RUN
ON
BASE
AT
BAT
OR
ON
DECK
HAVE
PITCHED
AT
LEAST
THREE
INNINGS
EFFECTIVELY
A
PITCHER
MAY
NOT
GET
A
WIN
AND
A
SAVE
IN
THE
SAME
GAME
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
OFFICIAL
SCORERS
MUST
ASSERT
MORE
OF
THEIR
AUTHORITY
IN
DETERMINING
WINNERSSAVERSETC
FOR
INSTANCE
A
PITCHER
CAN
COME
IN
IN
THE
NINTH
WITH
A
LEAD
BLOW
THE
LEAD
FALL
BEHIND
HAVE
HIS
TEAM
COME
BACK
IN
THE
NEXT
HALF
INNING
AND
EARN
THE
WIN
HAS
THIS
PITCHER
EARNED
A
WIN
NO
WAY
BUT
THIS
IS
AN
ARGUMENT
THAT
WINS
IS
A
DUMB
STAT
NOT
SAVES
I
GUY
COULD
PITCH
FIVE
STRONG
INNINGS
OF
MIDDLE
RELIEF
AND
SEE
HIS
TEAMMATES
RALLY
TO
TIE
THE
SCORE
ASSUME
HE
CAME
IN
TO
START
THE
FOURTH
AND
LEFT
AFTER
THE
EIGHTH
HIS
TEAMMATE
HOLDS
THE
OPPOSITION
SCORELESS
IN
THE
NINTH
AND
THEY
SCORE
A
RUN
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
NINTH
TO
WIN
THE
THIRD
PITCHER
EARNS
THE
WIN
AND
THE
MIDDLE
RELIEVER
GETS
NO
STAT
SATISFACTION
THIS
AGAIN
DOESNT
SUPPORT
YOUR
CLAIM
ABOUT
SAVES

THE
BEGINNING
