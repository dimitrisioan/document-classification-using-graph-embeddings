third

looks
good
too
bad
hes
moving
to
short
pagliarulo
mike
this
is
an
interesting
line
his
figure
was
slightly
below
average
his
was
pathetic
and
his
was
the
next
best
year
by
anybody
part
of
that
may
be
his
mobility
was
with
the
yankees
was
with
the
padres
who
appear
to
have
a
rotten
infield
was
with
the
twins
and
judging
by
leius
and
gaetti
the
metrodome
may
be
a
good
place
to
play
third

gary
apologies
if
i
dont
know
what
im
talking
about
but
as
a
twins
fan
i
like
to
think
they
have
good
players
in
any
park
not
sure
if
i
remember
completely
or
not
but
i
think
gaetti
played
with
the
twins
in
for
the
world
series
and
again
in
note
thats
his
lowest
of
the
i
believe
the
next
or
at
least
the
last
two
were
played
with
the
angels
actually
gaettis
first
year
with
california
was
his
da
wasnt
out
of
line
with
his
career
averages
and
his
was
actually
below
average
in
but
check
out
the
last
three
years
at
the
metrodome

league
have
been

three
different

including
one
pags
who
was
mediocre
to

elsewhere
that
doesnt
prove
a

effect
is
at

any
more
than
san
diegos
horrible
infield
numbers
prove
a
park
effect
is
at
work
but
it
looks
like
a
strong
possibility
to
me
lots
of
factors
make
a
player
excell
i
hate
it
when
so
many
use
the
dome
it
may
not
be
ideal
but
nice
to
comfortably
enjoy
baseball
and
football
even
when
its
snowing
and
raining
and
it
might
even
be
a
nice
play
