but
in
the

a
disputed
strike
call
has
been
enough
reason
to
step
out
of
the
batters
box
it
may
not
be
a
good
idea
it
may
even
irritate
the
umpire
but
ive
seen
it
a
lot
and
ive
seen
it
tolerated
just
not
this
time
the
key
words
here
are
in
the
past
everybody
was
warned
before
the
season
began
that
the
umpires
had
been
instructed
to
enforce
the
rule
in
the
interest
of
speeding
up
the
game
when
i
see
this
happening
to
other
players
ill
post
a
public
apology
to
mr
hirschbeck
until
then
i
think
this
was
a
case
of
selective
enforcement
