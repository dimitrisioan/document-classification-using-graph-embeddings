REFERENCE
TO
HISTORY
BECAUSE
HE
CERTAINLY
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
BEST
SEASON
FOR
SECOND
BASEMEN
IN
HISTORY
HE
PROBABLY
DIDNT
EVEN
HAVE
AS
GOOD
A
SEASON
AS
ALOMAR
LAST
YEAR
WHAT
DO
YOU
HAVE
SOME
MEASURE
LIKE
POPULARITY
IN
TORONTO
DOESNT
COUNT
THAT
YOU
ARE
BASING
THIS
STATEMENT
ON
UH
YES
BAERGA
HAS
A
LOT
OF
FLASH
BUT
ALOMAR
WAS
THE
BETTER
HITTER

THIS
IS
FASCINATING
YOU
SAY
THAT
ALOMAR
WAS
THE
BETTER
HITTER
LAST
YEAR
AND
IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOW
THAT
UP
WITH
NUMBERS
SHOWING
THAT
BAERGA
HAD
A
BETTER
YEAR
THE
ONLY
CATEGORY
THAT
I
SEE
WHICH
SHOWS
AN
ADVANTAGE
FOR
ALOMAR
IS
OBP
HMMMWHAT
ABOUT
WALKS
AND
SB
BAERGA
GOT
CLOBBERED
BY
ALOMAR
IN
OBP
AND
BEAT
HIM
IN
SLG
BY
A
LESSER
MARGIN
EVEN
PUTTING
ASIDE
ANY
OTHER
FACTORS
A
PLAYER
WITH
A
POINT
EDGE
IN
OBP
IS
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
THAN
A
PLAYER
WITH
A
POINT
EDGE
IN
SLG
THE
ISSUE
HAS
BEEN
STUDIED
BEFORE
AND
I
DOUBT
YOU
COULD
COME
UP
WITH
ANY
CONVINCING
ARGUMENT
THE
OTHER
WAY
PEOPLE
SEE
THE
BATTING
AVERAGE
AND
THE
HR
BUT
THEY
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
THEIR
VALUE
IS
WORTH
UNLESS
THEYVE
STUDIED
THE
ISSUE
CLOSELY
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
BAERGA
ATE
UP
A
LOT
MORE
OUTS
THAN
ALOMAR
WHILE
BAERGA
WAS
MAKING
OUTS
ALOMAR
WAS
DRAWING
WALKS
AND
BEING
ON
BASE
