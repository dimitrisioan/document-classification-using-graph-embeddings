games
standings
of
all
philadelphia
at
chicago
teams
tied
for
after
sunday
dick
redding
battled
chet
brewer
in
the
first
game
of
a
dramatic
four
game
series
one
friday
one
saturday
and
a
goodold
sunday
doubleheader
what
could
be
better
declared
ernie
banks
perhaps
the
fact
that
the
cubs
are
challenging
its
pitching
its
always
been
pitching
that
weve
lacked
announced
ryne
sandberg
if
we
can
get
by
brewer
then
beat
carlton
alexander
or
bunning
preferrably
of
the
last
three
well
know
we
might
be
able
to
win
lord
i
hope
we
pull
it
off
the
phils
scored
once
in
the
top
of
the
first
richie
ashburn
singled
pete
rose
followed
with
a
hit
sending
ashburn
around
second
kiki
cuyler
cut
the
ball
off
in
left
center
and
threw
a
bullet
in
to
ernie
banks
who
threw
to
ron
santo
to
get
ashburn
at
third
rose
went
to
second
on
the
play
christobel
torrienti
lifted
a
long
fly
to
center
moving
pete
rose
to
third
schmidt
was
walked
the
cubs
were
absolutely
refusing
to
let
him
beat
them
both
torrienti
and
schmidt
will
likely
draw
walks
this
year
chuck
klein
is
starting
to
hit
very
well
and
he
lashed
a
double
into
a
gap
in
rightcenter
cool
papa
bells
speed
allowed
him
to
cut
the
ball
off
and
prevent
schmidt
from
scoring
nellie
fox
was
walked
and
bob
boone
grounded
out
to
second
ending
the
threat
teams
are
starting
to
realize
that
you
dont
have
to
pitch
to
schmidt
or
torrienti
and
that
is
lowering
their
run
total
it
puts
a
lot
of
pressure
on
klein
and
dick
allen
who
platoons
with
chuck
klein
and
occasionally
spells
rose
at
first
and
its
a
credit
to
the
phillies
that
theyve
been
able
to
sustain
their
pace
the
picthers
have
slumped
at
times
so
came
the
analysis
from
frank
chance
the
cubs
got
that
run
back
when
bell
bunted
for
a
hit
thomas
grounder
moved
him
to
second
and
after
sandberg
made
out
billy
williams
singled
home
a
run
in
the
sixth
ron
santo
launched
a
tworun
homer
to
make
it
dick
redding
got
in
trouble
in
the
eighth
as
schmidt
singled
and
klein
singled
him
to
third
ed
reulbach
entered
to
face
fox
but
dick
allen
popped
out
of
the
dugout
to
hit
allen
doubled
to
right
but
luckily
for
the
cubs
williams
had
moved
to
left
and
andre
dawson
had
been
inserted
for
defense
he
fired
a
bullet
to
home
plate
to
keep
klein
at
third
lance
parrish
hitting
for
boone
was
walked
and
bruce
sutter
entered
larry
bowa
grounded
into
a
double
play
but
ed
delahanty
walked
as
a
pinchhitter
desiring
a
strikeout
since
ashburn
was
likely
to
attempt
a
bunt
hit
with
the
quick
trillo
pinchrunning
at
third
chance
brought
in
lee
smith
who
induced
a
popup
to
the
catcher
from
the
speedy
centerfielder
ending
the
inning
the
cubs
took
the
win
moving
a
game
behind
the
phillies
steve
carlton
was
called
upon
to
battle
brown
saturday
to
get
another
righthander
in
the
lineup
ron
santo
moved
to
first
and
bill
madlock
played
third
unfortunately
brown
allowed
six
doubles
and
the
cub
bullpen
was
worn
down
even
more
as
the
cubs
tried
to
maintain
a
lead
against
lefty
madlock
batting
sixth
had
knocked
two
doubles
of
his
own
driving
home
four
runs
gabby
hartnett
hit
two
home
runs
and
cuyler
added
another
and
the
score
was
cubs
after
six
innings
the
phillie
bullpen
had
more
troubles
in
the
bottom
of
the
eighth
as
the
cubs
grabbed
more
runs
to
ice
an
triumph
sundays
twin
bill
saw
cool
papa
bell
gather
seven
straight
hits
at
one
point
including
a
rare
outsidethepark
home
run
in
the
second
game
off
robin
roberts
grover
alexander
of
the
phils
took
the
first
contest
but
the
cubs
captured
the
second
one
with
waddell
gaining
the
win
bruce
sutter
tossed
two
innings
for
the
save
though
he
allowed
one
run
in
the
eighth
the
cardinals
stood
half
a
game
behind
these
coleaders
and
would
conclude
their
series
with
the
expos
on
monday
montreal
at
st
louisaugust
tie
for
dennis
martinez
is
on
a
roll
and
he
continued
it
versus
john
tudor
friday
the
expos
have
a
wide
variety
of
hitters
and
while
they
arent
among
the
alltime
greats
they
are
getting
the
job
done
after
winning
their
first
first
two
games
they
suddenly
found
themselves
only
games
out
of
first
in
this
wacky
season
martinez
triumphed
on
friday
and
williams
outdueled
dizzy
dean
saturday
however
the
cardinals
refused
to
give
up
winning
on
sunday
the
cards
captured
mondays
game
too
as
steve
carlton
outdueled
steve
rogers
were
really
good
against
ground
ball
pitchers
because
of
our
team
speed
remarked
lou
brock
i
dont
see
why
we
cant
win
this
division
the
phillies
and
cubs
may
have
some
reasons
for
them
twothirds
of
the
way
through
the
season
there
is
a
tie
for
first
new
york
at
pittsburghaugust
straight
wins
for
bucs
now
back
but
in
when
your
team
is
in
a
slump
like
we
are
the
worst
thing
is
to
play
in
a
pitchers
park
like
this
spoke
gil
hodges
before
the
series
keith
hernandez
added
that
their
defense
takes
away
quite
a
few
runs
per
year
and
it
must
be
giving
them
an
extra
wins
the
pirates
have
made
only
errors
all
season
ahead
of
the
second
place
dodgers
error
totals
tend
to
be
around
for
the
best
defensive
alltime
teams
rube
foster
defeated
sid
fernandez
friday
and
candelaria
outshone
seaver
saturday
in
a
game
featuring
some
outstanding
defense
when
nolan
ryan
and
two
relivers
the
mets
in
another
win
sunday
the
pirates
could
once
again
look
forward
to
a
victory
getting
them
back
to
the
mark
they
had
been
unable
to
several
times
in
the
past
month
bert
blyleven
met
dwight
gooden
in
the
afternoon
game
both
pitchers
possessed
fantastic
stuff
and
the
only
runs
scored
through
eight
innings
were
on
home
runs
a
solo
shot
by
rusty
staub
of
the
mets
and
a
tworun
blast
by
ralph
kiner
for
the
pirates
the
mets
darryl
strawberry
singled
home
a
run
in
the
top
of
the
ninth
off
jesse
orosco
working
his
second
inning
after
mookie
wilson
pinchran
for
gary
carter
at
second
with
one
out
and
a
runner
on
first
lee
mazilli
was
sent
in
to
pinchhit
the
pirates
countered
with
kent
tekulve
placing
him
in
the
fifth
spot
in
the
order
and
putting
barry
bonds
in
left
field
as
the
ninth
place
hitter
tekulve
induced
a
groundout
forcing
strawberry
at
second
he
slid
hard
into
honus
wagner
preventing
the
pirates
from
turning
their
fifth
double
play
of
the
afternoon
tekulve
allowed
a
hit
but
clemente
threw
mazilli
out
at
third
from
near
the
right
field
line
ending
the
inning
tug
mcgraw
relieved
randy
myers
who
entered
to
pitch
the
eighth
and
got
one
out
before
bonds
launched
a
rocket
to
deep
center
running
through
the
stop
sign
at
third
to
score
an
insidethepark
homer
to
win
the
pirates
had
scored
an
improbable
straight
wins
and
had
moved
to
within
games
of
first
place
with
seven
weeks
to
go
san
francisco
at
boswauktaaugust
another
sunday
doubleheader
appeared
on
the
schedule
as
the
giants
managed
to
close
the
gap
on
the
other
teams
thanks
to
some
starting
pitching
that
just
wouldnt
tire
in
fact
reported
manager
john
mcgraw
once
this
rough
part
of
the
schedule
is
over
maybe
as
early
as
this
coming
week
we
may
shift
to
a
rotation
again
for
a
little
while
juan
marichal
continued
his
hot
pitching
friday
beating
lew
burdette
and
the
braves
willie
mays
had
all
four
rbis
on
hits
rick
reuschel
faced
joe
niekro
saturday
in
a
slugfest
the
braves
park
had
been
a
homer
haven
but
this
took
the
cake
as
the
giants
won
a
seesaw
affair
willie
mays
had
three
homers
willie
mccovey
eddie
matthews
and
don
baylor
had
two
and
hank
aaron
ernie
lombardi
biz
mackey
and
mel
ott
had
one
each
the
braves
had
collected
home
runs
going
into
sundays
doubleheader
putting
them
on
a
pace
for
which
would
be
short
of
the
national
league
record
they
were
still
a
tad
behind
the
yankees
pace
they
had
allowed
over
though
vida
blue
actually
got
the
win
after
retiring
batters
in
the
fifth
he
allowed
only
a
run
in
the
sixth
but
faltered
in
the
seventh
joe
mcginnity
earned
the
save
in
the
doubleheader
the
braves
hoyt
wilhelm
failed
to
hold
a
lead
in
the
first
game
but
hank
aaron
homered
off
bill
foster
in
the
eighth
as
the
braves
won
the
giants
took
the
second
game
however
by
a
score
the
homer
by
aaron
was
a
magical
by
the
braves
however
they
fell
to
three
game
below
making
a
comeback
extremely
unlikely
san
diego
at
cincinnatiaug
randy
jones
faced
ewell
blackwell
in
the
first
of
this
series
and
the
padres
felt
rather
good
with
don
mattingly
straining
his
back
in
the
last
cleveland
game
the
trade
looked
even
better
mcgriffs
batting
average
was
even
rising
of
course
the
bench
was
very
poor
and
joe
gordon
was
only
adequate
in
the
outfield
but
these
were
minor
problems
since
the
pitching
was
holding
up
jones
pitched
a
good
game
friday
and
won
mcgriff
launched
two
home
runs
mel
harder
earned
a
win
with
the
help
of
mark
davis
and
ray
narleski
saturday
was
the
final
score
tom
candiotti
battled
satchel
paige
to
a
tie
through
eight
innings
before
departing
the
game
was
scoreless
for
more
innings
until
the
thirteenth
paige
had
departed
after
and
john
franco
hurled
a
scoreless
inning
tom
browning
was
working
his
second
scoreless
inning
when
dave
winfield
doubled
with
one
out
and
joe
gordon
was
pitched
around
thurm
munson
doubled
both
runners
home
and
the
padres
gamed
a
win
the
threegame
sweep
had
pulled
the
giants
into
a
tie
with
the
reds
though
the
reds
denied
it
the
highly
emotional
series
with
the
dodgers
may
have
taken
too
much
out
of
them
brookangeles
at
houstonaugust
another
series
capped
off
by
a
weekend
doubleheader
took
place
in
the
wide
open
plains
of
the
astrodome
the
astros
sent
joe
niekro
to
the
hill
in
the
first
game
opposite
don
drysdale
normally
drysdale
remarked
i
would
be
challenging
hitter
by
being
ready
to
throw
at
them
i
cant
afford
to
with
this
team
though
we
have
to
get
our
own
runners
going
we
cant
afford
to
let
the
astros
beat
us
he
then
winked
and
said
well
maybe
davis
will
get
decked
once
the
fact
that
glenn
davis
leads
the
team
in
homers
with
six
is
primarily
why
he
would
be
decked
but
it
should
be
understood
that
his
current
pace
would
give
him
nine
for
the
season
the
hitting
on
this
team
is
a
little
better
but
the
power
is
all
doubles
and
triples
still
carl
furillo
is
the
main
reason
no
astro
home
runs
were
hit
over
the
weekend
as
he
threw
two
runners
out
trying
for
insidethepark
homers
for
those
unaware
of
the
nastness
of
the
astros
park
they
have
a
high
gray
wall
all
around
the
outfield
balls
must
be
hit
into
the
seats
to
be
home
runs
the
foul
poles
are
feet
from
home
plate
but
the
alleys
are
feet
away
with
center
field
at
feet
its
as
if
some
threeyearold
threw
a
tantrum
and
told
his
playmates
if
i
cant
hit
home
runs
nobody
will
hit
home
runs
remarked
roy
campanella
the
dodgers
stole
five
bases
friday
but
the
astros
decided
to
revitalize
the
baltimore
chopping
that
had
failed
weeks
before
for
tonight
anyway
davis
jim
wynn
and
jose
cruz
did
not
have
to
mess
with
their
swings
according
to
the
manager
after
poles
and
willie
wells
reached
base
via
the
baltimore
chop
drysdale
decked
jose
cruz
with
a
pitch
he
responded
with
a
tworun
double
but
wynn
playing
first
for
davis
popped
up
and
the
astros
didnt
score
any
more
in
that
inning
they
did
score
in
the
fourth
to
erase
a
deficit
and
the
astros
wound
up
winning
they
threatened
to
do
even
better
the
next
game
as
tommy
john
would
be
their
opponent
walt
alston
met
privately
with
the
starters
at
am
before
the
game
i
think
i
know
how
we
can
beat
the
baltimore
chop
he
explained
how
can
we
do
that
pee
wee
reese
wondered
theyre
going
to
be
beating
the
ball
down
so
weve
got
to
be
ready
to
throw
on
the
run
steve
will
start
at
first
to
dig
balls
out
of
the
dirt
but
i
want
all
of
you
to
practice
your
barehanded
picks
and
throws
well
go
with
a
shallow
infield
almost
the
whole
time
the
plan
almost
worked
mike
scott
allowed
only
two
runs
through
eight
innings
but
the
astros
got
three
two
of
them
scored
when
bill
doran
pushed
a
bunt
into
the
outfield
in
the
fourth
with
runners
on
second
and
third
astros
was
the
final
with
dave
smith
earning
another
save
the
dodgers
scored
a
victory
in
the
first
game
of
the
twin
bill
sunday
as
nolan
ryan
walked
five
three
of
whom
scored
in
a
dodger
win
fernando
valenzuela
lost
the
second
game
to
don
sutton
however
as
the
dodgers
thirteen
stolen
bases
in
the
series
proved
to
not
be
enough
were
mostly
a
power
team
remarked
ron
cey
jackie
and
when
he
plays
maury
wills
are
our
only
real
speed
demons
though
a
couple
other
plays
can
do
it
now
and
then
were
sunk
in
a
place
like
the
astrodome
i
guess
thats
why
theyre
so
successful
there
indeed
it
seems
that
basestealing
teams
give
them
the
most
trouble
in
the
dome
the
stros
swiped
bases
in
attempts
giving
them
on
