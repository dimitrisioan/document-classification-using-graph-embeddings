TEAMS
ARE
STARTING
TO
REALIZE
THAT

THAT

LOWERING

IT
PUTS
A

ON
KLEIN
AND
DICK
ALLEN
WHO
PLATOONS

THEN
WINKED

SAID
WELL
MAYBE
DAVIS
WILL
GET
DECKED
ONCE
THE
FACT
THAT
GLENN
DAVIS
LEADS
THE
TEAM
IN
HOMERS
WITH
SIX
IS
PRIMARILY
WHY
HE
WOULD
BE
DECKED
BUT
IT
SHOULD
BE
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
HIS
CURRENT
PACE
WOULD
GIVE
HIM
NINE
FOR
THE
SEASON
THE
HITTING
ON
THIS
TEAM
IS
A
LITTLE
BETTER
BUT
THE
POWER
IS
ALL
DOUBLES
AND
TRIPLES
STILL
CARL
FURILLO
IS
THE
MAIN
REASON
NO

ANY

IN

THEY
DID
SCORE
IN
