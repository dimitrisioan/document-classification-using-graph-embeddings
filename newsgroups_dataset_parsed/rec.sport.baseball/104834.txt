WRITES
BEFORE
FOLKS
JUMP
ON
ME
LET
ME
ASK
THE
NET
WOULD
THE
JAYS
HAVE
WON
THE
AL
WITH
A
GOOD
PITCHER
FROM
AAA
IN
PLACE
OF
MORRIS
GIVEN
HIS
RUN
SUPPORT
HOW
ABOUT
AN
AVERAGE
ML
PITCHER
I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
MORRIS
PERFORMANCE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
AND
SERIES
HAD
A
LARGE
POSITIVE
IMPACT
ON
THE
JAYS
PERFORMANCE
I
KNOW
ITS
VERY
TRENDY
NOWADAYS
TO
DUMP
ON
MORRIS
BUT
LETS
GIVE
CREDIT
WHERE
CREDIT
IS
DUE
IT
IS
DOUBTFUL
THAT
THE
BLUE
JAYS
WOULD
HAVE
WON
THE
AL
EAST
WITHOUT
MORRIS
WELL
WHEN
YOU
SAY
WITHOUT
MORRIS
YOU
HAVE
TO
MENTION
AN
ASSUMED
REPLACEMENT
IF
THE
ALTERNATIVE
TO
MORRIS
WAS
LETTING
CITO
GASTON
SOFTTOSS
THE
BALL
UNDERHAND
TO
THE
OPPOSITION
EVERY
DAYS
THEN
OF
COURSE
THE
BLUE
JAYS
WOULDNT
HAVE
WON
WITHOUT
MORRIS
IF
THE
ALTERNATIVE
WAS
REPLACEMENT
LEVEL
THEN
I
THINK
IT
WOULDVE
BEEN
VERY
CLOSE
AND
YES
MORRIS
MIGHTVE
MADE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IF
THE
ALTERNATIVE
WAS
FRANK
VIOLA
THE
BLUE
JAYS
PROBABLY
WOULD
HAVE
WON
MORE
EASILY
WITH
VIOLA
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
THE
TEAM
WENT
FOR
THE
MONTH
OF
AUGUST
AND
ALL
THE
OTHER
STARTERS
WERE
BEING
SHELLED
AND
MILWAUKEE
WAS
MAKING
A
CHARGE
MORRIS
WENT
WITH
A
PRETTY
GOOD
ERA
I
CANT
REMEMBER
EXACTLY
YES
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
THE
HIS
PRESENCE
PREVENTED
THE
TEAM
FROM
COLLAPSING
IN
AUGUST
ALSO
LETS
NOT
UNDERESTIMATE
THE
IMPORTANCE
HIS
INNINGS
TO
SAVE
THE
BULLPEN
EVERY
FIFTH
DAY
IF
HE
DIDNT
HELP
US
WIN
THE
AL
EAST
FORGET
ABOUT
THE
PENNENT
AND
THE
WORLD
SERIES
THOSE
INNINGS
WERE
PROBABLY
HELPFUL
HIS
RUN
SUPPORT
WAS
HIGH
RUNS
BUT
SO
WAS
STOTTLEMYERS
RUNS
AND
HE
WON
ONLY
GAMES
I
DO
REMEMBER
MORRIS
WINNING
AN
INORDINATE
NUMBER
OF
AND
BALLGAMES
BUT
THIS
IS
TO
HIS
CREDIT
HE
PITCHED
ONLY
AS
GOOD
AS
HE
NEEDED
TO
BE
WHEN
HE
WAS
UP
IN
A
BALLGAME
HE
JUST
PUT
IT
IN
CRUISE
CONTROL
AND
THREW
THE
BALL
UP
THERE
AND
LET
THE
BATTERS
GET
THEMSELEVES
OUT
I
HATE
THIS
EXPRESSION
AN
INEXPERIENCED
PITCHER
WOULD
WEAR
HIMSELF
OUT
TRYING
TO
MAKE
PERFECT
PITCHES
TO
KEEP
HIS
ERA
DOWN
BUT
MORRIS
BEING
A
VETERAN
PITCHER
KNOWS
THAT
WINNING
IS
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
REALLY
MATTERS
IN
BASEBALL
BY
SAVING
HIMSELF
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
REACH
BACK
FOR
THAT
LITTLE
EXTRA
I
HATE
THIS
TOO
WHEN
THE
GAME
WAS
ON
THE
LINE
WELL
I
THINK
IS
COMPLETE
BS
WHAT
HAPPENED
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
IS
THAT
MORRIS
FELL
BEHIND
AND
THE
TEAM
CAME
BACK
AND
RESCUED
HIM
MOSTLY
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
HES
A
LOUSY
INNING
PITCHER
AND
MUCH
BETTER
THE
REST
OF
THE
WAY
THAT
THE
TEAM
CAN
CLIMB
OUT
OF
HOLES
CONSISTENTLY
AND
WIN
THEM
IS
NOT
TO
MORRIS
CREDIT
ITS
TO
THE
TEAMS
CREDIT
FURTHERMORE
WHILE
MORRIS
DID
EXCEED
THE
WL
PERCENTAGE
THAT
WOULD
BE
PROJECTED
FROM
HIS
RUNS
ALLOWED
AND
RUN
SUPPORT
HE
HASNT
DONE
THIS
IN
PREVIOUS
YEARS
IN
FACT
HIS
WL
RECORD
IN
IS
A
LOT
WORSE
THAN
WHAT
IT
PROJECTS
TO
BE
WITH
RUN
SUPPORT
AND
RUNS
ALLOWED
DO
YOU
THINK
HE
JUST
CAME
UP
WITH
THIS
ABILITY
IN
LOOK
AT
THE
POSTSEASON
GAMES
HE
PITCHED
DECENTLY
IN
TYPICAL
MORRIS
GAMES
MORRIS
GETS
BEHIND
TEAM
RESCUES
HIM
HES
NOT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THAT
RESCUE
AND
IN
BOTH
THOSE
GAMES
THE
TEAM
JUST
DIDNT
RESCUE
HIM
ENOUGH
JACK
MORRIS
PITCHED
AS
WELL
AS
HE
DID
DURING
MUCH
OF
THE
SEASON
IN
THOSE
GAMES
THE
OFFENSE
JUST
DIDNT
EARN
HIM
A
VICTORY
BTW
I
THINK
HE
SHOULD
BE
PUT
IN
THE
BULLPEN
IT
WOULD
BE
EMBARRASSING
A
VETERAN
PITCHER
WHICH
CITO
WOULD
NEVER
DO
BUT
HIS
ERA
IS
HOW
MUCH
MORE
CAN
HE
BE
EMBARRASSED
MORRIS
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
GUYS
WHO
WILL
RETURE
WHEN
HE
CANT
START
ANYMORE
HES
TOO
BAD
A
FIRST
INNING
PITCHER
TO
SERVE
IN
THE
BULLPEN
