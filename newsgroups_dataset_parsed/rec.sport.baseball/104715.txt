ok
ok
ok
first
my
apologies
for
perhaps
being
untimely
with
this
subject
material
and
perhaps
overly
optimistic
in
my
request
but
here
goes
anyhow
im
very
interested
in
finding
out
how
i
might
be
able
to
get
two
tickets
for
the
all
star
game
in
baltimore
this
year
my
very
aged
folks
live
about
miles
away
and
i
know
it
would
be
a
great
thing
for
them
to
attend
the
game
i
went
with
them
and
my
grandfather
who
got
me
into
baseball
as
a
small
child
to
the
all
star
game
in
dc
many
years
ago
although
im
now
in
the
sf
bay
area
id
love
to
be
able
to
treat
my
folks
to
this
game
its
absolutely
the
last
chance
theyd
ever
have
to
attend
this
g
ame
locally
any
info
would
be
greatly
appreciated
