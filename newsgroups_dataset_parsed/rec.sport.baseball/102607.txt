i
hope
to
god
that
ted
simmons
doesnt
get
the
weird
idea
of
trading
for
the
guy
and
if
he
does
he
had
better
not
include
jeff
king
in
the
deal
oh
godwhat
if
he
traded
zane
smith
and
jeff
king
for
vaughn
and
greg
blosser
it
would
be
worse
than
the

curse
hmm
i
guess
that
doesnt
sound
sincere
enough
oh
