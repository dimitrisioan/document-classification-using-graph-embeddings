cox
shouldve
protested
the
game
the
second
time
the
garbage
got
thrown
at
his
outfielders
he
should
also
have
protested
the
game
at
the
point
where
ron
gant
was
assessed
the
second
strike
in
the
ninth
on
the
grounds
that
he
cox
was
on
the
field
and
time
should
have
been
called
both
protests
would
be
denied
of
course
the
umpires
judgement
determines
the
garbage
thing
although
i
think
the
game
should
be
called
but
thats
my
personal
opiniondoesnt
matter
there
is
time
only
when
the
ump
says
so
the
second
argument
is
baseless
