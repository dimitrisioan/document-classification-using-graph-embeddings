AL
EAST
IS
BEST
IN
BASEBALL
IS
THERE
ANY
DOUBT
THAT
THIS
IS
TRUE
AFTER
A
FEW
DOWN
YEARS
THE
AL
EAST
IS
BACK
TO
WHERE
IT
WAS
IN
THE
EARLY
EIGHTIES
WITH
THE
EMERGENCE
OF
THE
OS
AND
THE
YANKS
IT
IS
FAR
AND
AWAY
THE
BEST
WHILE
THE
NL
WEST
HAS
THE
BEST
TEAM
IN
BASEBALL
AND
THE
REDS
ARENT
BAD
EITHER
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
ELSE
THE
GIANTS
ASTROS
AND
PADRES
ALL
HAVE
TALENT
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
ALL
AROUNF
TEAMS
THAT
ARE
FOUND
IN
THE
AL
EAST
AND
THE
DODGERS
JUST
PLAIN
SUCK
AS
FOR
THE
ROCKIES
WHO
KNOWS
THE
AL
EAST
HAS
THE
DEFENDING
CHAMPS
AND
ALTHOUGH
THEY
LOST
A
LOT
TO
FREE
AGENCY
TORONTO
IS
STILL
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
IN
BASEBALL
THE
ORIOLES
HAVE
THE
PRESEASON
FAVORITE
TO
WIN
THE
CY
YOUNG
IN
MIKE
MUSSINA
AND
YOU
CAN
NEVER
FORGET
ABOUT
RIPKEN
THE
SIGNINGS
OF
HAROLD
BAINES
AND
HAROLD
REYNOLDS
DONT
HURT
TO
MUCH
EITHER
ALTHOUGH
I
ALWAYS
LIKED
BILL
RIPKEN
WHILE
THEY
LET
A
LOT
GO
THIS
SUMMER
RANDY
MILLIGAN
JOE
ORSULAK
BILL
RIPKEN
BOB
MILACKI
SAM
HORN
STORM
DAVIS
AND
CRAIG
LEFFERTS
THEY
KEPT
THE
HEART
OF
THEIR
TEAM
INTACT
MY
PREDICTED
FINISH
BALTIMORE
COULD
BE
A
BIASED
OPINION
NY
YANKEES
TORONTO
MILWAUKEE
DETROIT
BOSTON
CLEVELAND
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
HIGHER
IF
NOT
FOR
THE
ACCIDENT
