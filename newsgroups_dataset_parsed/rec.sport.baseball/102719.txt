as
for
rushing
if
there
really
is
a
qualitative
difference
between
the
minors
and
the
majors
that
requires
a
period
of
adjustment
and
i
dont
believe
there
is
then
wouldnt
you
rather
waste
lopezs
old
good
season
than
his
old
very
good
season
or
his
excellent
season
the
sooner
you
get
him
acclimated
the
more
of
his
prime
you
get
to
use
can
anybody
name
a
player
who
was
rushed
to
the
majors
lets
for
arguments
sake
define
rushed
as
brought
up
to
the
majors
for
more
than
a
cup
of
coffee
prior
at
age
or
younger
and
performing
below
expectations
whose
career
was
damaged
by
this
rushing
im
serious
i
tend
to
agree
with
david
that
bringing
the
player
up
sooner
is
better
but
id
like
to
look
at
players
for
whom
this
theory
didnt
work
if
there
are
any
id
prefer
players
within
the
last
years
or
so
because
then
i
can
look
up
their
minor
league
stats
its
important
to
distinguish
between
players
who
legitimately
had
careers
below
what
their
minor
league
numbers
would
have
projected
as
opposed
to
players
who
were
hyped
and
failed
but
actually
had
careers
not
out
of
line
with
their
minor
league
numbers
lets
kick
it
off
with
an
example
of
a
player
who
was
rushed
although
there
doesnt
seem
to
have
been
any
damage
to
his
career
jay
bell
was
given
pas
in
the
major
leagues
at
age
and
performed
well
below
what
you
would
expect
from
his
aaa
numbers
the
same
season
he
got
pas
the
next
year
at
age
and
still
underperformed
however
the
next
year
at
age
his
performance
improved
and
he
won
the
everyday
shortstop
job
and
has
been
there
ever
since
its
really
hard
for
me
to
see
where
he
would
have
been
better
off
staying
in
the
minor
league
where
he
was
performed
quite
well
in
aaa
during
this
time
rather
than
being
rushed
cleveland
might
have
been
better
off
i
suppose
because
they
might
have
been
less
likely
to
give
up
on
him
yes
if
you
bring
a
player
up
early
hes
likely
going
to
struggle
but
does
that
delay
the
time
at
which
he
stops
struggling
and
starts
performing
up
to
expectations
