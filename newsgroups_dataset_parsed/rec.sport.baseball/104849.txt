QUESTION
IS
THERE
ANY
JUDGEMENT
CALL
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
SCORER
FOR
SAC
FLY
RBIS
THIS
IS
THE
SITUATION
THAT
BROUGHT
THE
QUESTION
UP
THE
RED
SOX
WERE
UP
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
BY
A
SCORE
OF
THE
MARINERS
HAD
THE
BASES
LOADED
WITH
OUT
THE
BATTER
HITS
A
FLY
TO
CENTER
WHICH
THE
FIELDER
CATCHES
THE
RUNNER
AT
THIRD
TAGS
AND
SCORES
WITHOUT
A
THROW
NOW
WITHOUT
A
JUDGEMENT
CALL
AND
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
IS
ONE
THIS
IS
AN
RBI
FOR
THE
BATTER
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
A
BETTER
NAME
FOR
THIS
WOULD
BE
DEFENSIVE
INDIFFERENCE
SINCE
IT
DOESNT
REALLY
MATTER
WHETHER
THE
GUY
AT
THIRD
SCORES
AT
THAT
POINT
I
KNOW
I
CAN
THINK
OF
SEVERAL
IF
THE
MARINERS
STOLE
THIRD
AND
SECOND
WHICH
OPENING
THE
BASE
WOULD
ALLOW
AND
THEN
THE
BATTER
HIT
A
GROUNDER
WHICH
THE
THIRD
BASEMAN
GETS
DEEP
IN
THE
HOLE
BETWEEN
HIMSELF
AND
THIRD
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
A
PLAY
AT
HOME
THIRD
OR
SECOND
FOR
THE
OUT
AND
MAYBE
HE
THEREFORE
CANT
MAKE
THE
THROW
TO
FIRST
TO
GET
THE
LAST
OUT
ETC
SCENARIOS
TOO
BUT
DOES
IT
REALLY
MATTER
IF
THIS
GUY
SCORES
THIS
WAY
WHEN
YOURE
DOWN
BY
IF
THE
TYING
RUN
IS
GOING
TO
SCORE
SO
IS
THE
GUY
ON
THIRD
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THE
BATTER
IMO
SHOULDNT
GET
CREDIT
AN
RBI
FOR
UTTERLY
FAILING
TO
DO
HIS
JOB
WHICH
AT
THIS
POINT
IS
TO
GET
A
HIT
OR
A
WALK
NOT
TRADE
AN
OUT
FOR
ONE
RUN
WHAT
DO
YOU
GUYS
