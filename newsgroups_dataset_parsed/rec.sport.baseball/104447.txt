pugh
must
have
been
slightly
shaken
as
he
was
popped
on

then
a

in
then
the
play
of
the
game
occured
saberhagen
was
due
up
so
reds
pitching
coach
larry
rothschild
met
with
the
infield
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
a
suicide
squeeze
they
called
it
perfectly
thompson
was
hung
out
to
dry
after
pughs
firstpitch
pitch
out
and
the
threat
ended
isnt
the
national
league
great
the
reds
picked
up
runs
in
the
seventh
to
knot
up
the
game
after

rob

came
on
in
the
ninth
and
pitched
shakily
with
two
outs
and
a
runner
on
second
bonilla
came
to
the
plate
and
all
i
could
think
of
was
the
sunday
game
in
late
august
last
year
when
bonillas
threerun
dinger
slapped
a
loss
on
dibble
and
spelled
the
beginning
of
the
end
for
cincis
season
bonilla
ended
up
walking
and
hojo
flied
out
to
left
to
give
the
reds
their
first
win
in
a
week
and
earned
dibble
his
third
save
in
as
many
opportunities
the
win
went
to
steve

who
got
in
what
must
be
an

the
lossthough
im
a
bit
surprised
he
even
pitched
in
