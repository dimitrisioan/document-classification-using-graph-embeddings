ok
roger
heres
a
question
for
you
say
you
are
running
an
expansion
team
you
dont
have
a
team
at
the
moment
but
the
draft
is
coming
up
who
are
you
going
to
pick
guys
who
have
won
the
most
ws
rings
or
guys
who
could
contribute
the
most
to
your
team
say
the
reds
were
dumb
enough
to
not
protect
larkin
and
the
jays
didnt
protect
alfredo
who
would
you
pick
for
an
expansion
team
im
pretty
sure
i
would
go
with
the
rings
as
long
as
their
salaries
and
ages
werent
too
high
i
would
want
the
fans
to
be
able
to
identify
the
players
i
would
like
a
championship
attitude
in
the
clubhouse
as
for
larkin
and
griffin
salaries
aside
i
would
have
to
consider
which
player
is
likeliest
to
contribute
to
a
ws
victory
past
performance
age
and
attitude
would
all
be
integral
to
my
decision
i
certainly
wouldnt
just
haul
out
my
copy
of
gillete
and
pick
larkin
as
many
others
would
and
unlike
many
others
who
post
to
this
group
i
hardly
consider
myself
quali
fied
to
make
those
kinds
of
decisions
i
cant
believe
im
getting
involved
in
this
i
have
never
been
able
to
believe
it
about
myself
to
tell
you
the
truth
its
like
banging
your
head
against
a
stone
wall
cordially
as
always
maynardramseycslaurentianca
so
many
morons
rm
and
so
little
time
