guess
which

which
ba
obp

ab

the
walks
should
give
it
away
obps
in
general
somewhat
more
valuable
than
slugging
and
alomars
edge
in
obp
was
quite
a
bit
larger
than
baergas
edge
in
slugging
im
no
sdcn
but
whats
more
valuable
hits
more
doubles
more
hrs
or
more
triples
and
bbs
lets
not
forget
the
extra
sbs
how
many
cs
alomar
had
cs
baerga
had
dont
forget
the
more
outs
baerga
had
his
gidp
balances
out
his
cs
and
he
had
one
more
sacrifice
than
alomar
a
replacement
level
second
baseman
could
have
had
hits
walks
and
a
couple
of
xbh
for
the
additional
outs
baerga
had
a
triple
is
little
different
than
a
home
run
were
talking
exchanging
almost
walks
for
six
or
seven
home
runs
and
four
doubles
i
would
say
the
walks
are
more
valuable
also
alomar
got
a
far
greater
boost
from
his
home
park
than
baerga
did
from
his
and
six
or
seven
home
runs
hmm
so
if
you
wanted
to
pick
a
second
baseman
to
play
in
toronto
youd
take
alomar
anywhere
else
and
youd
probably
take
baerga
