RE
THE
ALL
TIME
GREATS
TEAM
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
DAVE
WINFIELDS
NAME
DOES
NOT
GO
IN
THE
SAME
SENTENCE
AS
AARON
ROBINSON
AND
OTT
IN
TERMS
OF
PEAK
AND
I
REPEAT
PEAK
YEARS
WINFIELD
HAS
DONE
IT
ALL
HE
HAS
BATTED
IN
THE
FOR
A
SEASON
DROVE
IN
AND
MORE
RUNS
MANY
TIMES
IN
A
ROW
BEFORE
HIS
INJURY
CONSISTENTLY
HIT
AT
OR
NEAR
WHILE
KNOCKING
IN
HOME
RUNS
HAVE
YOU
EVEN
LOOKED
AT
DAVE
WINFIELDS
SLUGGING
PERCENTAGE
FOR
THREE
OR
OF
HIS
BEST
SEASONS
I
STILL
THINK
THAT
DAVE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
BETTER
OF
ALL
TIME
BUT
OBVIOUSLY
NOT
THE
BEST
HE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
ATHLETES
EVR
TO
PLAY
BASEBALL
HE
HIT
LINE
DRIVES
THAT
HIT
THE
SCOREBOARD
IN
LEFTCENTER
FIELD
A
FEAT
NP
ONE
HAS
DONE
IN
THE
NEW
STADIUM
HECK
ONLY
OR
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVE
HIT
IT
OVER
THAT
GREEN
FENCE
SINCE
IT
HAS
BEEN
REMODELED
HE
COULD
FIELD
HAD
A
BULLET
ARM
AND
HIS
HITTING
WAS
COMPARABLE
IN
MANY
SEASONS
TO
GARY
SHEFFIELDS
AND
BARRY
BONDS
OF
LAST
SEASON
HE
IS
OLDER
NOW
AND
SLOWING
DOWN
TAKES
MORE
OF
AN
UPPERCUT
TO
LIFT
THE
BALL
OUT
OF
THE
PARK
BUT
HE
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
MY
HERO
AND
MY
IDOL
THERE
IS
NOTHING
THAT
COULD
MAKE
ME
HAPPIER
THAN
GEORGE
INVITING
DAVE
BACK
TO
THE
BRONX
TO
PLAY
HIS
LAST
YEAR
OF
BALL
WITH
THE
YANKEES
OF
COURSE
HE
WILL
MOST
LIKELY
REFUSE
THE
OFFER
BUT
WHO
KNOWS
FOR
MILLION
DOLLARS
HELL
PLAY
HECK
THEY
ARE
GIVING
GALLEGO
MILLION
THIS
YEAR
HAVING
DAVE
AS
THEIR
DH
WHILE
LEAVING
HIM
TIME
TO
PLAY
THE
FIELD
WHEN
TARTABULL
IS
INJURED
OR
NOKES
AND
MASS
ARE
TRADED
SHOULD
GIVE
THE
YANKS
THE
INSPIRATION
AND
LEADERSHIP
THAT
WILL
SWEEP
IN
A
NEW
AGE
OF
YANKEE
DOMINATION
