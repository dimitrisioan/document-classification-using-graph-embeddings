amazingly
pitchers
no
matter
how
good
their
mechanics
are
not
machines
cy
young
winners
dont
pitch
in
a
vaccuum
unaware
of
how
their
offenses
are
doing
the
braves
pitching
staff
is
already
showing
signs
of
cracking
under
the
strain
of
knowing
theyre
not
going
to
get
many
if
any
runs
unfortunately
the
braves
pitchers
were
so
bad
for
so
long
that
the
organization
put
so
much
stress
and
i
mean
stress
on
pitching
that
they
completely
ignored
hitting
the
braves
right
now
are
looking
woefully
similar
to
the
braves
of
the
midseventies
heaven
