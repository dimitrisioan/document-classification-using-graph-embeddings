of
the
injury
if
indeed
there
is
one
or
weather
the
cold
air
in
colorado
just
got
his
joints
a
little
stiff
thanks
for
the
help
all
they
said
on
the
radio
that
he
developed
stiffness
in
the
shoulder
after
throwing
a
curveball
that
didnt
loosen
because
of
the
cold
night
in
denver
they
decided
to
remove
him
from
the
game
rather
than
let

pitch
he
is
