being
a
baseball
fan
and
a
fan
of
the
above
mentioned
band
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
clue
me
in
on
whether
the
dead
or
members
of
sang
the
national
anthem
at
todays
giant
opener
i
would
imagine
that
it
is
a
bit
too
early
for
anyone
to
know
but
an
answer
would
be
greatly
appreciated
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
dead
will
sing
the
na
at
the
giants
home
opener
on
mon
the
giants
are
opening
today
