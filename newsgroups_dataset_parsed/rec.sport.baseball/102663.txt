WRITES
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
TORONTO
PITTSBURGH
AND
NEW
YORK
NL
CHANGE
THEIR
UNIFORMS
EVERY
YEAR
EVERY
OTHER
YEAR
EG
NEW
YORK
IT
WILL
SAY
METS
IN
CURSIVE
NEW
YORK
IN
CURSIVE
OR
NEW
YORK
IN
ALL
CAPS
MINOR
CHANGES
BUT
THEY
DO
CHANGE
THEM
OFTEN
LAST
YEAR
I
THINK
THEY
HAD
NEW
YORK
IN
ALL
CAPS
DID
TORONTO
HAVE
BLUE
JAYS
OR
TORONTO
LAST
YEAR
WHAT
ABOUT
PITTSBURGH
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHICH
UNIFORMS
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
FOR
THE
LAST
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
I
BELIEVE
TORONTO
AND
PITTSBURGH
HAS
USED
THE
SAME
UNIFORMS
OR
AT
LEAST
VERY
SIMILAR
THE
HOME
JERSEYS
HAD
THE
TEAM
NICK
NAME
BLUE
JAYS
OR
PIRATES
BUT
THE
ROAD
JERSEYS
HAD
THE
NAME
OF
THE
CITY
TORONTO
OR
PITTSBURGH
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
THE
WAY
MOST
TEAMS
DESIGN
THEIR
UNIFORMS
