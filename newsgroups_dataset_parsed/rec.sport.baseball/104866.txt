quick
name
a
lighthitting
black
outfielder
or
who
lasted
years
in
the
bigs
i
bet
you
can
name
two
dozen
white
ones
otis
nixon
stole
bases
ok
hes
still
lighthitting
but
baseball
managers
dont
think
so
they
think
he
like
omar
moreno
before
him
is
a
perfect
leadoff
man
awesome
defense
darnell
coles
hes
still
around
because
of
his
when
he
hit
hr
henry
cotto
hasnt
played
years
in
the
bigs
wasnt
a
fulltime
majorleaguer
until
manny
mota
consistent
hitter
billy
hatcher
well
see
if
hes
still
around
in
for
his
tenth
year
herm
winningham
same
goes
for
herm
lonnie
smith
not
light
hitting
but
a
horror
in
the
field
doesnt
count
then
gary
redus
redus
is
hardly
lighthitting
plus
he
stole
bases
close
to
ops
career
against
lhp
dion
james
well
see
if
hes
still
around
in
to
qualify
daryl
boston
slugged
to
for
three
straight
years
in
one
of
the
worst
hitters
parks
in
the
nl
hes
going
to
be
one
of
colorados
better
players
this
year
plus
to
make
ten
you
have
to
count
all
the
time
he
spent
in
denver
and
buffalo
and
hawaii
while
with
the
white
sox
vince
coleman
yeah
hes
finally
started
to
have
a
decent
obp
coleman
assuming
he
makes
it
to
was
never
perceived
as
being
weak
offensively
though
of
course
he
was
led
nl
in
sb
his
first
six
years
in
the
majors
cecil
espy
well
see
if
hes
still
around
in
willie
wilson
wilson
has
always
been
overrated
but
hit
five
times
in
a
sixyear
stretch
and
led
the
league
in
triples
five
times
but
we
can
count
him
if
hes
still
playing
in
though
itll
be
because
hes
otis
nixon
deluxe
with
slightly
worse
defense
gary
pettis
okay
if
hes
in
the
league
this
year
he
can
count
though
hes
also
in
the
majors
because
of
otis
nixon
syndrome
milt
thompson
hes
not
spectacular
but
hes
neither
lighthitting
nor
a
tenyear
man
gary
varsho
halfway
there
and
unlikely
to
make
it
of
the
way
there
ok
i
admit
to
taking
a
quick
browse
through
the
major
league
handbook
but
only
after
the
first
or
oh
and
theres
the
alltime
lighthitting
black
outfielder
lou
brock
look
it
up
and
curt
flood
cesar
geronimo
cesar
cedeno
brock
suffered
from
otis
nixon
disease
but
he
wasnt
perceived
as
lighthitting
neither
was
curt
flood
cesar
cedeno
was
not
light
hitting
note
these
guys
may
not
have
reached
years
yet
but
theyve
got
to
be
close
likewise
for
my
list
oh
and
a
prediction
milt
cuyler
hell
have
to
steal
a
lot
more
bases
