i
agree
with
nick
whats
the
big
deal
about
long
games
if
you
want
to
watch
baseball
theres
that
much
more
baseball
to
watch
and
yes
baseball
includes
the
space
between
plays
as
well
as
the
plays
themselves
first
a
longer
game
in
no
way
suggests
more
baseball
to
watch
unless
you
include
watching
the
grass
grow
as
baseball
the
lengthier
games
are
so
because
of
batters
stepping
out
of
the
box
pitchers
taking
longer
between
pitches
and
excessive
trips
to
the
mound
by
managers
and
pitching
coaches
until
six
or
seven
years
ago
i
was
an
enthusiastic
fan
of
nfl
football
last
year
i
hardly
watched
a
game
what
turned
me
off
were
the
incessant
interruptions
to
the
continuity
of
the
game
a
team
scores
minutes
of
commercials
kickoff
minutes
of
commercials
three
downs
and
a
punt
minutes
of
commercials
aaaaarrrrgh
earlier
in
this
thread
i
commented
on
larussa
and
the
as
whom
i
believe
institutionalize
slow
play
i
dont
mind
the
catandmouse
game
with
rickey
on
first
in
fact
i
rather
enjoy
it
similarly
i
would
enjoy
the
battle
with
listach
or
lofton
or
polonia
on
first
what
i
object
to
is
when
such
games
are
played
with
karkovice
on
first
or
when
the
game
is
a
blowout
i
dont
mind
when
the
pitcher
steps
off
the
mound
to
gather
his
thoughts
in
a
crucial
situation
or
when
a
hitter
steps
out
of
the
box
to
regain
his
concentration
what
i
object
to
is
when
hitters
and
pitchers
take
such
breaks
at
every
opportunity
when
a
game
is
exciting
these
little
delays
serve
as
tension
builders
and
for
me
enhance
the
value
of
the
experience
of
the
game
when
the
delays
happen
with
regularity
they
become
nuisances
just
like
the
commercial
breaks
in
football
i
understand
the
nfl
imposed
a
number
of
rule
changes
to
speed
up
the
games
basically
putting
an
onus
on
the
officiating
staff
to
move
the
markers
and
the
ball
to
the
spots
faster
that
did
not
address
the
problem
of
the
continuity
of
the
game
it
may
have
appeased
the
sponsors
and
the
networks
but
i
would
be
amazed
if
it
did
anything
to
enhance
the
experience
of
the
fans
similary
while
some
baseball
games
bore
me
to
tears
those
are
the
ones
where
there
is
no
continuity
and
the
players
are
taking
exasperatingly
long
periods
to
get
ready
for
each
pitch
i
doubt
if
anyone
watching
the
bravesgiants
game
cared
about
gant
stepping
out
i
doubt
if
anyone
watching
that
game
would
have
found
that
pause
to
be
anything
but
an
opportunity
to
have
their
complete
attention
claimed
by
the
drama
that
was
present
i
would
be
totally
opposed
to
any
effort
that
would
eliminate
that
aspect
of
baseball
on
the
other
hand
i
wish
baseball
had
a
commissioner
that
was
powerful
enough
to
sit
down
with
aldersonlarussaduncan
and
explain
that
they
are
actually
hurting
the
product
of
baseball
by
dragging
their
games
out
the
way
that
they
do
i
sure
wouldnt
mind
a
little
armtwisting
there
