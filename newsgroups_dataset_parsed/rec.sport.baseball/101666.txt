FOR

A

USING
IT
IT
WORKS
LIKE
THIS
LOOK
AT
EVERY
SITUATION
IN
EVERY
GAME
IN
A
BASEBALL
SEASON
A
SITUATION
IS
DETERMINED
BY
INNING
SCORE
WHERE
THE
BASERUNNERS
ARE
AND
HOW
MANY
OUTS
THERE
ARE
FOR
EACH
SITUATION
COUNT
HOW
MANY
TIMES
THE

EVENTUALLY
WON
THE
GAME
THAT
THE
SITUATION
OCCURED
IN
AND
DIVIDE
BY
THE
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
THE
SITUATION
CAME
UP
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A

FOR
THAT
SITUATION
THIS
WAS

DONE
BY

IN

WERE
BASED
DIRECTLY
ON

ABSTRACT
BOOKS
HELP
ME
OUT
HERE
SOMEBODY
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
SITUATION
MIGHT
BE
INNING
SCORE
RUNNER
ON
SECOND
AND
NO
OUTS
THERE
WERE
REGULAR
SEASON
MAJOR
LEAGUE
GAMES
LAST
YEAR
WITH
THE
ROCKIES
AND
MARLINS
THERE
WILL
BE
MORE
THIS
YEAR
SAY
THIS
SITUATION
CAME
UP
IN
OF
THOSE
AND
THE
TEAM
AHEAD
WON
OF
THEM
THEN
THE
VALUE
OF
THIS
SITUATION
IS
DESCRIPTION
OF
METHOD
LOOK
AT
CHANGE
IN
WIN
PROBABILITY
BASED
ON
THE
AT
BAT
PLUS
ANY
BASERUNNING
AND
CREDITDEBIT
THE
PLAYER
BY
THAT
AMOUNT
EACH
TIME
HE
GETS
A
PLATE
APPEARANCE
NOW
FOR
EACH
PLAYER
SUM
UP
ALL
HIS
ATBAT
AND
BASERUNNING
VALUES
FOR
THE
SEASON
TO
OBTAIN
AN
OVERALL
VALUE
FOR
THAT
PLAYER
OBVIOUSLY
THE
SUM
OF
ALL
PLAYERS
VALUES
FOR
EACH
GAME
AND
FOR
THE
SEASON
AS
A
WHOLE
WILL
BE
THATS
ONLY
BECAUSE
YOU
ALWAYS
CREDIT
X
TO
THE
BATTER
AND
X
TO
THE
PITCHER
THERES
NO
VALIDATION
INVOLVED
OK
THERES
A
VERY
BIG
PROBLEM
HERE
THAT
NOBODY
HAS
YET
COMMENTED
ON
YOURE
ADDING
PROBABILITIES
AND
PROBABILITIES
DONT
ADD
RUNS
YOU
CAN
ADD
THE
TOTAL
TEAM
RUNS
BREAKS
DOWN
INTO
HOW
MANY
RUNS
JOE
CONTRIBUTED
PLUS
HOW
MANY
RUNS
FRED
CONTRIBUTED
ETC
BUT
PROBABILITIES
DONT
WORK
THAT
WAY
IF
BOB
INCREASES
HIS
TEAMS
CHANCE
OF
WINNING
BY
IN
EACH
OF
PAS
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
BOB
INCREASED
HIS
TEAMS
CHANCE
OF
WINNING
BY
IN
FACT
IT
DOESNT
MEAN
ANYTHING
BECAUSE
THE
UNITS
ARE
SCREWY
I
AGREE
AND
DISAGREE
JOHN
IS
SAYING
THAT
THE
BATTERS
EFFORTS
WILL
RESULT
IN
MORE
WINS
THEN
LOSSES
WHILE
YOU
ARE
PROBABLY
CORRECT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
MORE
WINS
THEN
LOSSES
IT
MEANS
SOMETHING
I
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
A
PLAYER
WHO
INCREASED
MY
TEAMS
CHANCES
OF
WINNING
BY
IN
EACH
OF
PAS
THEN
I
WOULD
A
PLAYER
WHO
INCREASED
MY
CHANCES
OF
WINNING
BY
IN
EACH
OF
PAS
THUS
THERE
APPEARS
TO
ME
TO
BE
AN
OBVIOUS
POSITIVE
ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN
JOHNS
STATISTIC
AND
WINNING
GAMES
THUS
BEFORE
YOU
DISREGARD
THIS
STAT
IT
APPEARS
TO
ME
THAT
FURTHER
STUDY
MUST
GO
INTO
WHAT
SORT
OF
RELATIONSHIP
THERE
IS
CONSIDER
AN
EXAMPLE
BOB
HITS
A
SOLO
HR
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
FIRST
ABOUT
ON
YOUR
SCALE
HE
DOES
THE
SAME
THING
AGAIN
IN
THE
FOURTH
WITH
THE
SCORE
TIED
FOR
ANOTHER
AND
AGAIN
IN
THE
SEVENTH
WITH
THE
SCORE
TIED
FOR
ANOTHER
AND
FINALLY
IN
THE
NINTH
TO
WIN
THE
GAME
BY
A
SCORE
OF
FOR
A
VALUE
OF
BOB
HIT
SOLO
HR
IN
PLATE
APPEARANCES
AND
WAS
CREDITED
BY
YOUR
METHOD
WITH
BUT
WHAT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
WAS
BOB
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
WIN
CERTAINLY
NOT
THE
DEFENSE
IS
ALWAYS
RESPONSIBLE
IF
YOU
INCLUDE
PITCHING
IN
THAT
AND
BOB
WASNT
PITCHING
IN
FACT
BOB
WAS
ONLY
OF
THE
OFFENSE
WHICH
IS
A
LOT
BUT
NOT
EVEN
CLOSE
TO
FURTHERMORE
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
OTHER
TEAM
RUNS
SAY
THEY
ALL
CAME
ON
SOLO
HR
BY
FRED
THEN
FRED
WAS
HITTING
HR
TO
TIE
UP
THE
GAME
WHICH
ARE
JUST
AS
VALUABLE
AS
HR
TO
TAKE
THE
LEAD
SEE
LINDSEY
AND
FRED
WILL
HIMSELF
HAVE
ACCRUED
A
GOOD
RATING
OR
SO
SO
FRED
AND
BOB
COMBINED
HAVE
AMASSED
OF
A
WIN
IN
ONE
GAME
THERES
CLEARLY
A
PROBLEM
HERE
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
AN
INSISTANCE
THAT
THESE
NUMBER
MEAN
EXACTLY
HOW
MANY
WINS
THE
TEAM
HAS
FIRST
WE
ARE
USING
AVERAGES
OVER
MANY
SEASONS
AND
APPLYING
THEM
TO
ONE
GAME
SECOND
REMEMBER
SOME
PLAYERS
PERFORMANCE
TAKE
AWAY
FROM
THE
CHANCE
OF
YOU
WINNING
THAT
IS
A
PLAYER
WHO
GETS
AN
OUT
GETS
A
NEGATIVE
PROBABILITY
IN
MOST
CASES
THUS
IM
NOT
SURE
IN
ANY
GIVEN
GAME
WHEN
YOU
ADD
UP
ALL
THE
NUMBERS
FOR
A
TEAM
WHO
WON
THAT
THEY
WILL
ADD
UP
TO
IN
THAT
GAME
SOMETIMES
THEY
WILL
ADD
UP
TO
MORE
THEN
ONE
SOMETIME
LESS
THAN
ONE
ALSO
THE
PITCHERS
BAD
PERFORMANCES
GIVING
UP
RUNS
MAY
HAVE
GIVEN
THEM
A
LARGE
NEGATIVE
PERCENTAGE
FOR
THAT
GAME
ALSO
ANY
BATTER
THAT
PULLED
AN
NIGHT
WOULD
GIVE
LARGE
NEGATIVES
GREG
THINKING
ABOUT
THE
RIGHT
THINGS
BUT
HIS
INTUITION
IS
OFF
THE
MARK
CLOSERS
ARE
ENORMOUSLY
IMPORTANT
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
RUNS
VALUE
IS
OUTWEIGHED
BY
WHEN
THEY
COME
OR
ARE
PREVENTED
FROM
COMMING
THE
DOUBLING
WHICH
GREG
ALLOWS
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
IN
ANOTHER
ARTICLE
I
PROPOSED
A
TEST
OF
THIS
WE
CAN
PREDICT
A
TEAMS
WONLOST
RECORD
QUITE
ACCURATELY
BY
LOOKING
AT
HOW
MANY
RUNS
TOTAL
THEY
SCORE
AND
ALLOW
WITHOUT
REGARD
TO
WHEN
THOSE
RUNS
SCORE
IN
THE
GAME
IF
LATE
RUNS
ARE
REALLY
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
EARLY
RUNS
THEN
LOOKING
ONLY
AT
LATE
RUNS
SHOULD
LEAD
TO
A
BETTER
PREDICTOR
RIGHT
NO
BUT
REALLY
ONLY
BECAUSE
YOU
HAVE
A
SMALLER
SAMPLE
SIZE
I
WOULD
THINK
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
NUMBER
OF
RUNS
YOU
SCORE
IN
THE
FIRST
INNING
WOULD
BE
JUST
AS
GOOD
AS
A
PREDICTION
AS
HOW
MANY
RUNS
YOU
SCORE
IN
THE
LAST
INNING
AND
REALIZE
SOMETHING
ELSE
A
CLOSER
USUALLY
COMES
IN
IN
A
CLOSE
SITUATION
NOT
A
BLOW
OUT
IT
IS
HARD
TO
ARGUE
THAT
ANY
RUNS
THAT
A
CLOSER
GIVES
UP
IN
A
GAME
HAVE
EQUAL
IMPORTANCE
TO
THOSE
GIVEN
UP
IN
THE
FIRST
INNING
LOOK
A
CLOSER
GIVING
UP
RUNS
OFTEN
MEANS
A
TEAM
WILL
LOSE
MANY
GAMES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
A
STARTER
WHO
GIVES
UP
RUNS
OFTEN
STILL
LEAVES
HIS
TEAM
A
CHANCE
TO
WIN
THE
OFFENCE
HAS
MANY
MORE
OUTS
TO
DO
SOMETHING
ABOUT
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
ALL
LATE
INNING
SITUATIONS
ARE
EQUALLY
IMPORTANT
EITHER
IF
I
AM
DOWN
RUNS
IN
THE
NINTH
IT
REALLY
DOES
NOT
MATTER
HOW
MANY
RUNS
MY
PITCHER
GIVES
UP
IN
THE
NINTH
HERES
ANOTHER
THOUGHT
EXPERIMENT
APPLY
THIS
METHOD
TO
BASKETBALL
WHAT
YOU
FIND
IS
THAT
POINTS
SCORED
IN
THE
FIRST
HALF
OF
THE
GAME
HAVE
ALMOST
EXACTLY
NO
VALUE
BECAUSE
NO
LEAD
IS
SAFE
WITH
AN
ENTIRE
HALF
YET
TO
PLAY
FURTHERMORE
THE
SUB
IN
OFF
THE
BENCH
WHO
SINKS
THE
WINNING
FREE
THROWS
WITH
NO
TIME
ON
THE
CLOCK
GETS
A
FOR
THE
GAME
WHILE
THE
STAR
FORWARD
WHO
SCORED
POINTS
IN
THE
FIRST
HALF
BEFORE
SPRAINING
HIS
ANKLE
GETS
A
ZERO
DOES
THIS
MAKE
SENSE
NO
BUT
WHY
WOULD
YOU
ASSUME
THAT
THE
TEAMS
PROBABILITY
OF
WINNING
WOULD
BE
BEFORE
THE
POSSESION
IN
WHICH
THE
FREE
THROWS
WERE
MADE
LOOK
IF
YOU
ARE
DOWN
POINT
WITH
SECONDS
LEFT
THERE
IS
A
FAIRLY
HIGH
PROBABILITY
THAT
YOU
WILL
WIN
THE
GAME
IF
YOU
ARE
IN
POSSESION
OF
THE
BALL
AND
DO
NOT
FORGET
THAT
SOMEBODY
ELSES
MISSED
SHOTS
TURNOVERS
FOULS
BAD
DEFENSE
ETC
CAUSED
A
NEGATIVE
CHANCE
THAT
THE
TEAM
WOULD
WIN
FROM
READING
ALL
OF
THE
DISCUSSION
ON
THIS
STATISTIC
I
FEEL
THAT
THOSE
WHO
CRITISIZE
IT
TO
A
CERTAIN
EXTENT
ARE
DOING
SO
OUT
OF
AN
AGENDA
AT
FIRST
LOOK
THIS
STATISTIC
VALADATES
CLUTCHNESS
BUT
IT
REALLY
DOES
NOT
CLUTHNESS
REVOLVES
AROUND
THE
IDEA
THAT
CERTAIN
PLAYERS
IN
CRUCIAL
SITUATION
ELEVATE
THEIR
PERFORMANCE
AND
OTHERS
PERFORMANCE
GOES
DOWN
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
CONVINCING
PROOF
THAT
THIS
REALLY
HAPPENS
SO
IF
YOU
ASSUME
THERE
IS
NO
CLUTCHNESS
THEN
THAT
MEANS
THAT
EXCEPT
FOR
A
LOT
OF
NOICE
THIS
STATISTIC
HAS
A
POSITIVE
ASSOCIATION
TO
PLAYER
PERFORMANCE
THERE
IS
A
WAY
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
NOICE
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
CLUTCHNESS
CERTAINLY
WE
COULD
FIND
OUT
WHAT
THE
AVERAGE
VALUE
OF
A
HOME
RUN
IS
FOR
EXAMPLE
WE
MAY
FIND
FOR
INSTANCE
THAT
A
HOME
RUN
INCREASES
YOUR
CHANCE
OF
WINNING
BY
ON
AVERAGE
WHILE
A
STRIKEOUT
DECREASES
YOUR
CHANCE
OF
WINNING
BY
I
BET
IF
THIS
WERE
DONE
WE
WOULD
FIND
THAT
THIS
STATISTIC
WAS
JUST
AS
GOOD
AS
OTHER
STATISTICS
WE
HAVE
FOR
PREDICTING
WINS
AND
LOSSES
HOW
DO
WE
EVALUATE
RELIEF
PITCHERS
SAY
JOHN
AND
SAM
HAVE
THE
EXACT
SAME
PITCHING
STATISTICS
RUNS
EARNED
RUNS
KS
BBS
ETC
BOTH
HAD
EXCEPTIONAL
NUMBERS
JOHN
HOWEVER
ONLY
PITCHED
IN
CLOSER
SITUATIONS
WHILE
SAM
WAS
A
MOP
UP
MAN
WHO
WAS
MORE
VALUBLE
TO
THEIR
TEAM
PROBABLY
JOHN
WHO
WAS
THE
BETTER
PITCHER
THEY
WERE
PROBABLY
ABOUT
THE
SAME
