HOW
DOES
A

GET
A
SAVE

GEOFFREY
E
DIAS
WRITES
THE
SUBJECT
LINE
SAYS
IT
ALL
WHAT
IS
THE
RULE
THAT
QUALIFIES
A
PITCHER
AS
MAKING
A
SAVE
IMHO
THIS
IS
THE
MOST
UNTRUSTWORTHY
SILLY
STAT
BY
TODAYS
RULES
IN
ALL
OF
BASEBALL
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
TO
QUALIFY
AS
A
SAVE
A
PITCHER
CANNOT
PITCH
MORE
THAN
THREE
INNINGS
AND
THE
POTENTIAL
TYING
RUN
MUST
AT
LEAST
APPEAR
IN
THE
ONDECK
CIRCLE
ALSO
THE
LEAD
A
PITCHER
ENTERS
WITH
CANNOT
EXCEDE
THREE
RUNS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
OFFICIAL
SCORERS
MUST
ASSERT
MORE
OF
THEIR
AUTHORITY
IN
DETERMINING
WINNERSSAVERSETC
FOR
INSTANCE
A
PITCHER
CAN
COME
IN
IN
THE
NINTH
WITH
A
LEAD
BLOW
THE
LEAD
FALL
BEHIND
HAVE
HIS
TEAM
COME
BACK
IN
THE
NEXT
HALF
INNING
AND
EARN
THE
WIN
HAS
THIS
PITCHER
EARNED
A
WIN
NO
WAY
I
GUY
COULD
PITCH
FIVE
STRONG
INNINGS
OF
MIDDLE
RELIEF
AND
SEE
HIS
TEAMMATES
RALLY
TO
TIE
THE
SCORE
ASSUME
HE
CAME
IN
TO
START
THE
FOURTH
AND
LEFT
AFTER
THE
EIGHTH
HIS
TEAMMATE
HOLDS
THE
OPPOSITION
SCORELESS
IN
THE
NINTH
AND
THEY
SCORE
A
RUN
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
NINTH
TO
WIN
THE
THIRD
PITCHER
EARNS
THE
WIN
AND
THE
MIDDLE
RELIEVER
GETS
NO
STAT
SATISFACTION
