quick
name
a
lighthitting
black
outfielder
or
who
lasted
years
in
the
bigs
i
bet
you
can
name
two
dozen
white
ones
otis
nixon
stole
bases
ok
hes
still
lighthitting
but
baseball
managers
dont
think
so
they
think
he
like
omar
moreno
before
him
is
a
perfect
leadoff
man
awesome
defense
well
yeah
on
the
other
hand
for
the
first
few
years
of
his
career
he
looked
like
herb
washington
dan
gladden
doesnt
seem
to
suck
defensively
either
darnell
coles
hes
still
around
because
of
his
when
he
hit
hr
yeah
and
how
many
of
the
white
guys
played
one
year
into
a
long
career
its
actually
not
an
uncommon
phenomenon
and
how
long
a
guy
hangs
around
based
on
one
good
year
seems
like
a
reasonable
question
to
explore
on
a
racial
basis
billy
hatcher
well
see
if
hes
still
around
in
for
his
tenth
year
hey
he
plays
for
lou
gorman
doesnt
he
ok
so
its
eight
years
ok
i
admit
to
taking
a
quick
browse
through
the
major
league
handbook
but
only
after
the
first
or
oh
and
theres
the
alltime
lighthitting
black
outfielder
lou
brock
look
it
up
and
curt
flood
cesar
geronimo
cesar
cedeno
brock
suffered
from
otis
nixon
disease
but
he
wasnt
perceived
as
lighthitting
neither
was
curt
flood
cesar
cedeno
was
not
light
hitting
good
point
on
cedeno
otoh
i
havent
seen
that
extensive
list
of
dan
gladdens
either
there
really
arent
that
many
players
altogether
who

years
even
if
theyre
reasonably
good
