RE
INFIELD
FLY
RULE
ONE
LAST
INFIELD
FLY
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
ALWAYS
PUZZLED
ME
AND
HASNT
YET
BEEN
ADDRESSED
I
BELIEVE
THE
RULE
ALSO
DOES
NOT
DEAL
WITH
THIS
SITUATION
IF
INFIELD
FLY
IS
DECLARED
AND
THE
BALL
IS
CAUGHT
RUNNERS
CAN
TAG
UP
AND
ADVANCE
AT
THEIR
OWN
RISK
AS
ON
ANY
FLY
BALL
HOWEVER
IF
THE
INFIELD
FLY
IS
NOT
CAUGHT
AT
WHAT
POINT
CAN
A
RUNNER
LEGALLY
LEAVE
HIS
BASE
WO
FEAR
OF
BEING
DOUBLED
OFF
FOR
ADVANCING
TOO
EARLY
WHEN
THE
BALL
HITS
THE
GROUND
WHEN
A
FIELDER
FIRST
TOUCHES
THE
BALL
AFTER
IT
HITS
THE
GROUND
ENLIGHTENMENT
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
JAY
