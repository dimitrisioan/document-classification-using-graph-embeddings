ABOUT
A
MONTH
BACK
THAT
THE
RED
SOX
ARE
GETTING
A
NEW
DOME
STADIUM
I
HAVE
RELATIVES
THAT
JUST
MOVED
UP
THAT
WAY
AND
THEY
SAID
ABOUT
THE
CITY
RELEASING
THE

CAN
ANYBODY
VERIFY

I
HAVE
LIVED
IN
THE
BOSTON

LIVED
HERE
ONE
DAY
THE
LAST
HURDLE
HAS
BEEN
OVERCOME
AND
THE
NEXT
DAY
THERES
A
NEW
HURDLE
FANS
HAVE
BEEN
GRUMBLING
ABOUT
FOXBORO
STADIUM
OR
WHATEVER
ITS
CALLED
THIS
YEAR
FOR
NEARLY
AS
LONG
BUT
THERE
ARE
ONLY
PRELIMINARY
PROPOSALS
FOR
A
NEW
STADIUM
LOCAL
POLITICS
PREVENTS
ANYTHING
FROM
BEING
DONE
IN
A
TIMELY

THERE

LIFETIME
