re
new
home
for
the
bosox
writes
i
heard
about
a
month
back
that
the
red
sox
are
getting
a
new
dome
stadium
i
have
relatives
that
just
moved
up
that
way
and
they
said
about
the
city
releasing
the
funds
can
anybody
verify
this
to
a
game
bosox
fan
in
pa
i
have
lived
in
the
boston
area
for
years
now
they
have
been
talking
about
a
new
boston
garden
hockeybasketball
since
ive
lived
here
one
day
the
last
hurdle
has
been
overcome
and
the
next
day
theres
a
new
hurdle
fans
have
been
grumbling
about
foxboro
stadium
or
whatever
its
called
this
year
for
nearly
as
long
but
there
are
only
preliminary
proposals
for
a
new
stadium
local
politics
prevents
anything
from
being
done
in
a
timely
fashion
there
will
not
be
a
new
ballpark
in
my
lifetime
