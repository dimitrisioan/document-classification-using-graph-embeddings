MARK
SINGER
WRITES
THE
MEDIA
IS
BEATING
THE
INCIDENT
AT
DODGER
STADIUM
ON
WEDNESDAY
TO
DEATH
BUT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANYTHING
IN
RSB
YET
GERALD
PERRY
OF
THE
CARDINALS
PINCH
HIT
IN
THE
EIGHTH
INNING
WITH
TWO
ON
AND
HIS
CLUB
DOWN
BY
A
RUN
HE
STROKED
A
LINE
DRIVE
INTO
THE
RIGHT
FIELD
CORNER
THE
BALL
CLEARED
THE
THREEFOOT
HIGH
FENCE
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
CROWD
DARRYL
RACING
OVER
FROM
RIGHT
CENTER
GOT
TO
THE
SPOT
IN
TIME
TO
REACH
HIS
GLOVE
UP
OVER
THE
SHORT
FENCE
BUT
HE
MISSED
THE
BALL
A
FAN
SITTING
IN
THE
FRONT
ROW
WEARING
A
MITT
REACHED
UP
AND
CAUGHT
THE
BALL
HOME
RUN
NOW
IVE
SEEN
THE
REPLAY
SEVERAL
TIMES
AND
I
HAVE
CONCLUDED
THAT
DARRYL
MISSED
THE
BALL
AND
THAT
THE
FANS
GLOVE
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
BEHIND
DARRYLS
SEVERAL
DODGER
FANS
WITH
SEATS
IN
THE
IMMEDIATE
VICINITY
HAVE
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
FAN
UNQUESTIONABLY
INTERFERED
WITH
STRAWBERRY
WHAT
CANNOT
BE
DISPUTED
HOWEVER
IS
THAT
THE
FAN
WHO
CAUGHT
THE
BALL
NEVER
TOOK
HIS
EYE
OFF
IT
HE
WAS
OBLIVIOUS
TO
WHERE
THE
FIELDER
WAS
PLAYING
HE
WAS
ALSO
QUITE
EXUBERANT
AS
SOON
AS
HE
REALIZED
HE
HAD
MADE
THE
CATCH
STUFF
ABOUT
DARYL
AND
TOMMY
AND
EVERYONE
BLAMING
FAN
FOR
THE
LOSS
DELETED
I
SAW
THE
REPLAY
SEVERAL
TIMES
TOO
NO
QUESTION
ABOUT
IT
DARYL
MISSED
THE
BALL
THEN
THE
FAN
CAUGHT
IT
DARYL
IS
SO
TALL
THAT
HE
HAD
THE
FIRST
SHOT
AT
THE
BALL
DARYLS
JUST
WHINING
AGAIN
I
THINK
IT
SHOWS
A
LACK
OF
CLASS
WHEN
TOMMY
DARYL
AND
THE
DODGERS
BLAME
A
SINGLE
FAN
FOR
LOSING
THE
GAME
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PITCHER
WHO
THREW
UP
THE
GOPHER
BALL
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PITCHERS
THAT
GAVE
UP
RUNS
UP
TO
THAT
POINT
SORRY
TOMMY
IF
IT
WERE
A
GAME
AND
DARYL
WAS
FEET
INCHES
TALL
THEN
MAYBE
JUST
MAYBE
YOUD
HAVE
AN
ARGUMENT
