because
he
certainly
didnt
have
the
best
season
for

basemen
in
history
he
probably
didnt
even
have
as
good
a
season
as
alomar
last
year
what

this
is
fascinating
you
say
that
alomar
was
the
better
hitter
last

and
immediately
follow
that
up
with
numbers
showing
that
baerga
had
a
better
year
the
only
category
that
i
see
which
shows
an
advantage
for
alomar
is
obp
