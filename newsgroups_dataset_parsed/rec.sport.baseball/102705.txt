HOW
MANY

WILL
BE
SCORED
IN

I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
SOME
IDEA
CAN
BE
GOTTEN
BY
LOOKING
AT
THE

SCORED
IN

STADIUM
DURING
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
OF
THE

THE

IT
SEEMS
PRETTY
CLEAR
THAT

WILL
HAVE
A

ILL
STICK
WITH
MY
PREDICTION
FROM

THAT
ITLL
BE
ONE
OF
THE

IN
THE

AND
A
FAIRLY
LARGE

ON

THOUGH
APPARENTLY
NOT
AS
LARGE
AS
ATLANTA
