at

certainly
rather
have
a

luck
is
going

play
a

bigger
role
than
in
the
game
but
you
still
need
the
pitching
staff
to
hold
the
opposing
team
to
one
run
not
if
youve
scored
four
runs
you
dont
why
strain
even
the
best
pitching
staff
why
not
make
it
easier
for
them
in
the
game
the
best
pitching
staff
in
the
world
cant
compensate
for
a
blown
call
a
bad
hop
a
gust
of
wind
winning
close
is
the
wrong
way
to
win
both
keeping
opposing
runs
down
and
scoring
a

yourself
are
insurance
against
