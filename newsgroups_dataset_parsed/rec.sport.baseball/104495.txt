RE
ZANERESCUE
US
FROM
SIMMONS
MAMATHA
DEVINENI
RATNAM
WRITES
SO
FAR
SIMMONS
LOOKS
LIKE
A
TOTAL
IDIOT
WHATEVER
YOU
SAY
I
THINK
ITS
JUST
GAMES
INTO
THE
SEASON
MYSELF
SO
IM
GOING
TO
WAIT
A
BIT
BEFORE
CALLING
NAMES
I
AM
SURE
SIMMONS
WAS
READY
TO
SAY
I
TOLD
YOU
SO
AFTER
OTTO
HAD
AN
IMPRESSIVE
WIN
LAST
WEEK
NOW
OTTOS
LATEST
DEBACLE
HAS
RESTORED
SIMMONS
REPUTATION
NOW
HE
LOOKS
LIKE
HE
IS
BACK
IN
HIS
FORM
WHEN
HE
HAD
THE
ALS
HIGHEST
ERA
AMONG
STARTERS
FOUR
OUR
SAKENOT
TEDS
SAKE
I
HOPE
HE
PITCHES
WITH
A
ERA
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
SEASON
YEAH
RIGHT
I
EXPECT
THAT
DAVE
OTTO
WILL
BE
A
REALLY
BAD
PITCHER
AND
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHY
SIMMONS
EVER
WANTED
HIM
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
EXPECT
HIM
TO
RELEASE
OTTO
IF
HE
DOESNT
TURN
THINGS
AROUND
PRETTY
FAST
BTW
OTTOS
GAME
SCORE
FOR
THAT
IP
STINKER
WAS
ONLY
WHICH
POINTS
OUT
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
METHOD
SINCE
OTTOS
PERFORMANCE
WAS
INFINITELY
BAD
AND
EXCRUCIATINGLY
PROLONGED
TOMLIN
AND
MERCED
ARE
A
BIT
DISAPPOINTING
THEY
ARE
STILL
DOING
DECENTLY
BUT
CONSIDERING
THE
CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
TALENT
AND
MATURITY
THEY
HAVE
SHOWN
THEIR
FIRST
SEASONS
THEY
SEEM
TO
HAVE
ACTUALLY
GOTTEN
A
LITTLE
BIT
WORSE
I
THINK
MERCEDS
ROOKIE
YEAR
WAS
A
BIT
FLUKEY
BUT
ARENT
YOU
WILLING
TO
GIVE
HIM
SOME
MORE
AT
BATS
AND
TOMLIN
A
FEW
MORE
STARTS
BEFORE
ACTING
SO
GLOOMY
WALK
WELL
HE
SEEMS
TO
BE
ON
THE
LOSING
END
TONIGHT
BUT
I
STILL
THINK
THAT
WALK
DESRVED
HIS
CONTRACT
NO
HE
DIDNT
WALK
IS
A
TIME
BOMB
HE
HAS
NO
STUFF
WHATSOEVER
AND
WHEN
THE
LEAGUE
FINALLY
REALIZES
THIS
IT
WONT
BE
PRETTY
AT
ALL
THE
ROOKIE
BATTERS
WELL
YOUNG
HAS
SURPRISED
ME
A
BIT
WITH
HIS
INSTANT
IMPACT
OTHER
THAN
THAT
THEIR
EXCELLENT
PERFORMANCE
HASNT
BEEN
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
SURPRISE
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
THANK
DOUGHTY
FOR
THAT
DONT
BE
SO
FAST
DOUGHTY
IS
THE
GUY
WHO
SIGNED
STEVE
BUECHELE
WHICH
WAS
A
MOVE
THAT
THREATENED
TO
BURY
KEVIN
YOUNG
IN
THE
MINORS
MEANWHILE
IM
NOT
SURE
WHETHER
DOUGHTY
OR
SIMMONS
SIGNED
MARTIN
AS
A
SIXYEAR
FREE
AGENT
BEFORE
THE
SEASON
ROOKIE
PITCHERS
WORSE
THAN
EXPECTED
ESPECIALLY
COOKE
TWICE
THROUGH
THE
ROTATION
AND
YOUVE
GIVEN
UP
YIKES
SLAUGHT
HOW
COME
HE
WASNT
GIVEN
A
CONTRACT
EXTENSION
LAST
YEAR
NOW
HIS
VALUE
HAS
INCREASED
IMMENSELY
BUT
SO
HAS
HIS
AGE
AT
LEAST
IN
BASEBALL
TERMS
THE
USEFUL
HALFLIFE
OF
A
YEAROLD
INJURYPRONE
CATCHER
CANT
BE
MUCH
LONGER
THAN
A
YEAR
LONNIE
SMITH
WELL
ERIC
DAVIS
WAS
SIGNED
FOR
A
COMPARABLE
AMOUNT
BUT
HE
WANTED
TO
BE
A
DODGER
AND
FELT
HE
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
PROVE
AFTER
HIS
DISASTROUS
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
WAS
ANY
CHANCE
FOR
THE
BUCS
TO
SIGN
HIM
LETS
SEE
ERIC
CAN
HIT
BETTER
HE
CAN
RUN
BETTER
HE
CAN
FIELD
BETTER
NOW
WHY
DIDNT
THE
PIRATES
GO
AFTER
ERIC
DAVIS
AN
INJURED
DAVIS
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
HEALTHY
LONNIE
SMITH
HE
CERTAINLY
WASNT
LAST
YEAR
EVEN
IF
LONNNIE
SMITH
GETS
SOME
BIG
HITS
THIS
YEARHE
WONT
BE
AN
ASSET
HE
HAS
LOOKED
TERRIBLE
ON
THE
BASES
AND
IN
THE
FIELD
HEY
THATS
THE
SKATES
SMITH
PACKAGE
DEAL
ANYBODY
WHO
ACQUIRES
LONNIE
FOR
HIS
DEFENSE
OR
BASERUNNING
PARTICULARLY
AT
THIS
STAGE
IS
A
REAL
WEIRDO
MANAGEMENT
BIG
BIG
ZERO
SAUER
HAS
YET
TO
MAKE
A
FORCEFUL
ARGUMENT
IN
FAVOR
OF
REVENUE
SHARING
HE
SEEMS
MORE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
PLEASING
THAT
IDIOT
DANFORTH
BY
PREPARING
THE
TEAM
FOR
A
MOVE
TO
TAMPA
BAY
IF
THATS
THE
GOAL
OF
THE
TEAM
OWNERSHIP
THAN
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
SAUER
GETS
A
ZERO
FOR
MAKING
HIS
BOSS
HAPPY
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
HE
HAS
OR
HASNT
SAID
ABOUT
REVENUE
SHARING
SO
I
CANT
COMMENT
THERE
ALEX
COLE
FIASCO
STUFF
DELETED
IRONICALLY
THE
BIGGEST
ACCOMPLISHMENT
OF
SIMMONS
TENURE
WAS
GETTING
ALEX
COLE
REALLY
CHEAP
TOO
BAD
THAT
HE
GAVE
HIM
AWAY
IN
THE
EXPANSION
DRAFT
ITS
ANNOYING
BUT
SINCE
LEYLAND
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
PUSHING
FOR
THEM
TO
RETAIN
JEFF
KING
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
UNAVOIDABLE
MEANWHILE
I
THINK
BIGGER
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
OF
SIMMONS
TENURE
WERE
GETTING
SOME
VALUE
FOR
JOHN
SMILEY
NOT
TRADING
REAL
PROSPECTS
FOR
VETERANS
DOWN
THE
STRETCH
LAST
YEAR
DRAFTING
WELL
IN
LETTING
THE
ROOKIES
SHOW
SOMETHING
IN
FOLEY
SMITH
AND
CANDELARIA
WERE
ACQUIRED
TO
BE
REPLACEMENT
PARTS
WHICH
MEANS
THAT
EVEN
IF
FAIL
IT
HASNT
DONE
SERIOUS
DAMAGE
TO
THE
BUCS
FUTURE
COMPENSATORY
DRAFT
PICKS
FOR
BONDS
FORGET
IT
THE
PIRATES
CAN
RANT
AND
RAVE
THEY
WILL
NOT
GET
THOSE
PICKS
AS
OF
NOW
THE
ISSUE
IS
STILL
BEING
APPEALED
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
THE
BUCS
LOST
THE
INITIAL
ARBITRATION
CASE
I
NEVER
HEARD
THE
OUTCOME
OF
THIS
WHEN
WILL
THE
FINAL
VERDICT
BE
IN
ON
THIS
NOW
IF
THIS
DOESNT
CONVINCE
ANYONE
THAT
SIMMONS
AND
SAUER
ARE
IDIOTS
NOTHING
ELSE
WILL
IM
NOT
SURE
WHO
WAS
THE
IDIOT
IN
THIS
CASE
SO
I
DONT
KNOW
WHO
TO
BLAME
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
DOUG
DANFORTH
AFTER
ALL
IN
FACT
I
SERIOUSLY
SUSPECT
IT
WAS
DOUG
DANFORTH
WHO
HAS
SHOWN
HIS
WILLINGNESS
TO
CALL
THE
SHOTS
AT
EXACTLY
THOSE
MOMENTS
WHEN
THE
GUN
IS
POINTED
AT
HIS
FEET
BTWIVE
WONDERED
WHETHER
MY
LATEST
POSTS
HAVE
BEEN
GETTING
OFFSITE
SO
IF
SOMEBODY
KNOWN
TO
IMPERSONATE
EE
CUMMINGS
CAN
SEE
THIS
WOULD
HE
DROP
ME
A
SHORT
NOTE
JKING
