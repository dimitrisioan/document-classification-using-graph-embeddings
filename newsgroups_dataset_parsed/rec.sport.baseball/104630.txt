dont
you
guys
think
so
i
mean
cmon
what
the
heck
are
women
doing
even
thinking
of
getting
into
baseball
they
cause
so
many
problems
just
assuming
youre
serious
i
guess
youd
be
surprised
to
hear
that
us
guys
dont
think
so
i
would
guess
that
a
tiny
fraction
of
of
the
folks
reading
your
post
agree
with
it
i
kind
of
doubt
that
even
you
agree
with
it
sheesh
i
agree
with
you
here
dave
anyone
for
starting
recsportsidiots
for
guys
like
austin
no
but
i
am
for
starting
recsportsidiots
for
people
who
respond
to
obvious
flamebait
nah
lets
reserve
recsportsidiots
for
people
who
post
obvious
flamebait
like
yourself
if
someone
posts
something
as
controversial
not
to
mention
idiotic
as
what
austin
posted
in
a
widely
accessed
newsgroup
someone
should
challenge
the
statement
there
is
a
school
of
thought
that
suggests
that
silence
consent
whereas
this
idea
may
not
apply
to
everything
in
life
it
certainly
should
apply
to
a
forum
of
public
discussion
which
rsb
is
if
youve
been
reading
rsb
lately
youll
find
that
even
elementary
school
children
have
had
access
to
our
postings
alibet
in
an
edited
form
its
making
me
think
a
little
more
carefully
about
some
of
the
things
i
post
in
conclusion
if
someone
like
austin
wants
to
post
his
drivel
in
some
obscure
newsgroup
that
i
dont
read
fine
hes
got
the
right
to
rant
rave
and
drool
all
he
wants
to
in
the
name
of
free
speech
but
if
he
drools
in
a
newsgroup
that
i
read
then
i
will
support
the
right
of
anyone
to
provide
rebuttal
to
his
drooling
now
of
course
you
dont
have
to
read
any
of
this
and
if
you
want
to
cut
down
on
flames
then
dont
post
flamebait
you
dont
have
to
respond
to
flames
either
saves
cyberspace
sheesh
