IF
SOMEONE
POSTS
SOMETHING
AS
CONTROVERSIAL
NOT
TO
MENTION
IDIOTIC
AS
WHAT
AUSTIN
POSTED
IN
A
WIDELY
ACCESSED
NEWSGROUP
SOMEONE
SHOULD
CHALLENGE
THE
STATEMENT
THERE
IS
A
SCHOOL
OF
THOUGHT
THAT
SUGGESTS
THAT
SILENCE
CONSENT
WHEREAS
THIS
IDEA
MAY
NOT
APPLY
TO
EVERYTHING
IN
LIFE
IT
CERTAINLY
SHOULD
APPLY
TO
A
FORUM
OF
PUBLIC
DISCUSSION
WHICH
RSB
IS
IF
YOUVE
BEEN
READING

LATELY
YOULL
FIND
THAT
EVEN
ELEMENTARY

HAVE
HAD

ALIBET
IN
AN
EDITED

ITS
MAKING
ME
THINK
A
LITTLE
MORE
CAREFULLY
ABOUT

I
POST
IN
CONCLUSION
IF
SOMEONE
LIKE
AUSTIN
WANTS
TO
POST
HIS
DRIVEL

SOME
OBSCURE
NEWSGROUP
THAT

DONT

FINE
HES
GOT
THE
RIGHT
TO
RANT
RAVE
AND
DROOL
ALL
HE
WANTS
TO
IN
THE
NAME
OF
FREE
SPEECH
BUT
IF
HE
DROOLS
IN
A
NEWSGROUP
THAT
I
READ
THEN
I
WILL
SUPPORT
THE
RIGHT
OF
ANYONE
TO
PROVIDE
REBUTTAL
TO
HIS
DROOLING
NOW
OF
COURSE
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
READ
ANY
OF
THIS
AND
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
CUT
DOWN
ON
FLAMES
THEN
DONT
POST
FLAMEBAIT
