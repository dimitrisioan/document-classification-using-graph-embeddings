RE
WFAN
FROM
IAN
M
DERBY
NO
HES
NOT
NUTS
WIP
IS
SECOND
TO
NONE
THE
SPORTS
STATION
THEY
DONT
HAVE
TONY
BRUNO
WORKING
ESPN
RADIO
AND
AL
MORGANTI
DOING
FRIDAY
NIGHT
HOCKEY
BECAUSE
THEY
SUCK
I
LIVE
IN
RICHMOND
VA
BUT
I
VISIT
PHILA
OFTEN
AND
ON
THE
WAY
I
GET
WTEM
WASHINGTON
AND
WIP
I
HEAR
THE
FAN
AT
NIGHT
WHEREVER
I
GO
THE
SIGNAL
USED
TO
BE
WNBC
WHEN
THEY
PLAYED
GOLDEN
OLDIES
BECAUSE
YOU
CANT
AVOID
IT
OF
THOSE
THREE
WIP
HAS
THE
BEST
HOSTS
HANDS
DOWN
CHUCK
COOPERSTEIN
ISNT
A
HOMER
AND
NEITHER
IS
JODY
MAC
WTEM
IS
TOO
GENERIC
TO
BE
PLACED
IN
THE
CATERGORY
IN
FACT
IF
YOU
HAVE
HEARD
WTEM
AND
THE
FAN
YOU
NOTICE
THE
THEME
MUSIC
IS
IDENTICALSAME
OWNERSHIP
I
THINK
SO
WIP
IS
TOTALLY
ORIGINAL
THEIR
HOSTS
ACTUALLY
HAVE
A
PERSONALITY
THIS
IS
A
KNOCK
AT
TEM
THE
TEAM
NOT
THE
FAN
BECAUSE
MIKE
AND
THE
MAD
DOG
AND
SOMMERS
ARE
GOOD
I
MEAN
COMPARING
THE
MORNING
GUYS
IN
PHILADELPHIA
TO
THE
ONES
IN
WASHINGTON
IS
A
TOTAL
JOKE
ANYWAY
I
LIKE
THE
FAN
AND
WIP
BUT
I
THINK
THE
EDGE
GOES
TO
IP
WHEN
I
GET
BACK
FROM
PHILLY
I
GO
INTO
WITHDRAW
CAUSE
RICHMOND
HAS
NADA
EXCEPT
THE
NATIONAL
SPORTS
LINE
AND
THOSE
GUYS
ARE
TOTALLY
CLUELESS
I
WAS
REALLY
MAD
WHEN
WCAU
WAS
CANCELLED
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
STEVE
FREDERICKS
DOING
SPORTS
PHONE
AFTER
THE
PHILLIES
GAMES
WCAU
IS
ANOTHER
STRONG
STATION
NOW
ITS
AN
OLDIES
STATION
BUT
THEY
STILL
HAVE
THE
PHILLIES
I
STARTED
LISTENING
TO
THE
FAN
BECAUSE
I
HEARD
HE
WENT
THERE
I
FINALLY
HEARD
HIM
LAST
SUMMER
AND
HE
WASNT
THE
SAME
GUY
THOSE
NY
FANS
GOT
TO
HIM
I
WAS
GLAD
TO
HEAR
HIM
BACK
IN
PHILLY
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
SEE
A
FEW
EAGLES
GAMES
I
WILL
ADMIT
I
AM
DIE
HARD
EAGLES
FAN
AND
WIP
IS
BASICALLY
AN
EAGLES
STATION
DAYS
A
YEAR
BUT
I
BET
YOU
THE
PHILLIES
ARE
IN
CONTROL
RIGHT
NOW
ABOUT
THE
KNOCK
ON
G
COBB
I
LIKE
HIM
HE
KNOWS
THE
EAGLES
LIKE
A
BOOK
I
REMEMBER
THE
WEEKEND
BEFORE
THEY
WENT
TO
PLAY
SAN
FRAN
WHEN
EVERYONE
THOUGHT
THE
EAGLES
WOULD
BE
BLOWN
AWAY
COBB
SAID
THAT
THE
EAGLES
USUALLY
PLAY
THEIR
BEST
WHEN
NO
ONE
BELIEVE
THEY
CAN
WIN
WELL
THEY
WERE
INCHES
SHY
OF
PULLING
THE
VICTORY
WELL
THATS
MY
