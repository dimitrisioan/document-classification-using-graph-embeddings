THE
BRAVES
WILL
COME
AROUND
TO
ALL
THE
BRAVES
DOUBTERS
DONT
WORRY
THE
BATS
WILL
COME
ALIVE
AND
THE
BRAVES
WILL
COME
AROUND
THE
PITCHING
IS
SOLID
AND
AS
LONG
THE
BRAVES
DONT
HAVE
SERIOUS
INJURIES
TO
THE
STARTING
ROTATION
THEYLL
CONTINUE
TO
PITCH
WELL
HECK
WITH
THE
FIVE
STARTERS
ON
THE
BRAVES
ROTATION
THEY
COULD
EVEN
SUSTAIN
AN
INJURY
TO
ONE
OF
THE
FIVE
I
HOPE
THIS
DOESNT
HAPPEN
THOUGH
THE
BATS
ARE
THERE
PENDLETON
WILL
CERTAINLY
BAT
OVER
JUSTICE
IS
CATCHING
FIRE
BREAM
NIXON
SANDERS
GANT
WELL
THERES
TOO
MUCH
OFFENSE
THERE
TO
BE
KEPT
QUIET
FOR
MUCH
LONGER
RIGHT
NOW
THE
CLEVELAND
INDIANS
HAVE
PLAYERS
BATTING
OVER
BUT
I
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
THEIR
SEVEN
FOR
OUR
RESPECTIVE
SEVEN
THOUGH
WOULDNT
THE
BRAVES
BE
SOMETHING
RIGHT
NOW
WITH
THEIR
PITCHING
AND
PLAYERS
BATTING
OVER
THE
BULLPEN
WELL
IT
IS
SUSPECT
BUT
WHEN
THE
BATS
COME
ALIVE
THE
GUYS
IN
THE
BULLPEN
WILL
BE
OF
LESS
CONCERN
SO
ANYWAY
I
BELIEVE
THE
BRAVES
WILL
BE
TOUGH
TO
BEAT
THIS
SEASON
IM
NOT
SAYING
THE
BRAVES
HAVE
AUTOMATICALLY
WON
THE
DIVISION
BUT
IM
OPTIM
ISTIC
ABOUT
THEIR
SEASON
THOUGH
ITS
AWFUL
PAINFUL
TO
WATCH
THEM
AT
TIMES
RIGHT
NOW
GO
BRAVES
