going
to
a
cubbies
game
well
after
suffering
from
an
intense
fit
of
minnesotainduced
cabin
fever
ive
decided
to
road
trip
to
milwaukee
and
take
in
a
couple
of
games
this
weekend
a
couple
games
at
county
stadium
will
be
great
to
relieve
tension
but
i
thought
why
not
go
to
wrigley
for
a
game
too
i
see
the
cubs
are
playing
the
phillies
on
sat
start
i
believe
thats
eastern
time
listed
i
figured
it
would
be
fun
to
bounce
down
to
wrigley
for
the
day
game
and
live
it
up
a
little
im
wondering
if
anyone
esp
cubbie
fans
have
some
advice
on
if
im
taking
skokie
hwy
south
until
it
runs
into
whats
the
best
way
to
get
to
wrigley
im
planning
on
getting
there
an
hour
or
two
early
and
paying
through
the
nose
for
parking
to
keep
things
easy
is
it
probable
that
ill
be
able
to
walk
up
and
get
bleacher
seats
or
on
game
day
i
figure
since
its
early
in
the
year
rynos
out
and
the
weather
isnt
great
i
should
be
able
to
get
tickets
if
not
whats
the
best
way
to
get
advance
tickets
can
i
call
the
cubs
ticket
office
directly
and
pick
up
tickets
at
the
will
call
window
any
advice
on
where
to
eat
before
or
after
the
game
do
they
allow
inflatable
iluvewe
dolls
present
from
lundy
into
the
