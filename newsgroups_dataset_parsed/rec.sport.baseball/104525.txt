HAL
MCRAE
FROM
RBDFLASHECEUCEDU
BOBBY
DAVIS
WRITES
NOHAL
MCRAE
IS
THE
WORST
MANAGER
IN
BASEBALL
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ENOUGH
ROYALS
GAMES
TO
JUDGE
HIS
TACTICS
SO
YOU
MAY
HAVE
A
POINT
HERE
BUT
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
GUY
WHO
CAN
WASTE
TALENT
LIKE
HE
CAN
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
RAWTALENT
STAFFS
IN
THE
LEAGUE
AND
HES
STILL
FINDING
A
WAY
TO
LOSE
IMO
THE
ROYALS
DONT
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
WIN
THE
PENNANT
EVEN
IF
MCRAE
SUDDENLY
BEGAN
CHANNELING
FOR
JOHN
MCGRAW
OK
THEY
HAVE
SOME
DECENT
PITCHERS
BUT
WHEN
YOUR
OFFENSE
CONSISTS
OF
BUMS
LIKE
GAGNE
AND
LIND
AND
MCREYNOLDS
AND
MCRAE
AND
AN
OVERTHEHILL
BRETT
YOURE
NOT
GOING
TO
FINISH
UNLESS
MCGRAW
BRINGS
CHRISTY
MATHEWSON
BACK
WITH
HIM
ID
SAY
IT
IS
HARD
TO
EVALUATE
A
MANAGER
WHEN
ALL
OF
HIS
HITTERS
SUCK
