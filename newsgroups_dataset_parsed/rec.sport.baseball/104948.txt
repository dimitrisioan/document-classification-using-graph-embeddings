some
folks
like
to
argue
about
theoretical
details
i
prefer
to
watch
teams
win
when
the
giants
slip
to
third
then
we
can
talk
about
how
to
rearrange
the
batting
order
until
then
i
think
its
stupid
to
focus
on
whats
wrong
for
the
simple
fact
that
its
working
as
it
is
this
is
a
fine
strategy
if
you
expect
to
run
away
with
the
division
but
the
giants
are
going
to
need
every
break
they
can
get
if
they
want
too
hold
that
lead
i
dont
think
they
can
afford
to
be
lackadaisical
and
say
well
it
has
worked
pretty
well
so
far
and
while
we
might
be
able
to
improve
the
results
we
dont
think
it
is
worth
the
risk
mostly
though
the
giants
are
winning
and
frankly
as
long
as
that
continues
its
rather
silly
to
secondguess
their
strategy
but
evidently
some
folks
would
rather
be
right
than
be
first
the
two
tend
to
go
hand
in
hand
