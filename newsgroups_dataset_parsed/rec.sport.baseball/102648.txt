MAJ
THIS
IS
WHAT
JACKSON
LOOKED
LIKE
IN
WITH
EVERYTHING
CONVERTED
TO
A
NEUTRAL
PARK
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
RUN
PRODUCTION
HIS
EQUIVALENT
AVERAGE
STARTED
AT
IN
WAS
UP
TO
IN
AND
IN
SO
LET
US
SAY
HE
HAD
ESTABLISHED
IN
HIS
LAST
TWO
SEASONS
A
LEVEL
OF
PLAY
IM
NOT
QUITE
SURE
HOW
THESE
NUMBERS
ARE
GENERATED
IT
APPEARS
THAT
IN
A
NEUTRAL
PARK
BOS
HR
AND
SLUGGING
TEND
TO
DROP
HE
ACTUALLY
LOSES
TWO
HOME
RUNS
OR
DO
THEY
WHAT
IS
EQUIVALENT
AVERAGE
ONE
THING
WHEN
LOOKING
AT
BOS
STATS
IS
THAT
YOU
CAN
SEE
THAT
KC
TOOK
AWAY
SOME
HOMERS
NORMALLY
YOU
EXPECT
SOME
WOULDBE
HOMERS
TO
GO
FOR
DOUBLES
OR
TRIPLES
IN
BIG
PARKS
OR
TO
BE
CAUGHT
AND
FOR
THAT
MATTER
YOU
EXPECT
LOTS
OF
DOUBLES
AND
TRIPLES
ANYWAY
BUT
BO
DESPITE
HIS
SPEED
HIT
VERY
FEW
DOUBLES
AND
NOT
THAT
MANY
TRIPLES
SO
I
WOULD
EXPECT
HIS
VALUE
TO
HAVE
RISEN
QUITE
CONSIDERABLY
IN
A
NEUTRAL
PARK
THAT
IS
GOOD
VERY
GOOD
IN
FACT
BUT
IT
PROBABLY
DOESNT
MAKE
THE
TOP
TEN
IN
THE
LEAGUE
THE
BEST
EQA
IN
THE
AL
IN
WAS
DAVE
WINFIELDS
THOMAS
WAS
FIRST
AT
FIRST
IN
THE
NL
WAS
BONDS
AN
INCROYABLE
TENTH
WAS
BIP
ROBERTS
BUT
IS
BETTER
THAN
ANY
SEASON
IN
THE
PAST
FIVE
YEARS
BY
JOE
CARTER
IT
IS
ABOUT
WHAT
MATTINGLY
HAD
IN
WHAT
FELIX
JOSE
HAD
THE
LAST
TWO
YEARS
JUST
AHEAD
OF
TIME
RAINES
FIVEYEAR
AVERAGE
BETTER
THAN
RYAN
KLESKOS
MLES
FELIX
JOSE
HAS
BEEN
A
PLAYER
IN
A
FAIRLY
NEUTRAL
PARK
I
WOULD
OFFHAND
GUESS
THE
BO
AT
AROUND
A
PLAYER
MAYBE
NOT
EVEN
CLOSE
HE
GOT
MORE
ATTENTION
FROM
THE
MEDIA
THAN
WAS
WARRANTED
FROM
HIS
BASEBALL
PLAYING
THOUGH
HIS
HYPE
WAS
A
LOT
BETTER
THAN
HIS
HITTING
THAT
IS
THE
BASIS
FOR
THE
NETCOMMENTS
ABOUT
HIM
BEING
OVERRATED
THE
MEDIA
WOULD
HAVE
YOU
BELEIVE
HE
WAS
A
GREAT
HITTER
I
THINK
HE
WAS
A
GOOD
MAYBE
VERY
GOOD
HITTER
HE
WAS
IMO
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
BEST
HITTER
IN
THE
MAJORS
ID
PUT
HIM
ABOUT
THERE
TOO
NOTE
I
HADNT
REALIZED
THE
MEDIA
HAD
HYPED
HIM
SO
MUCH
I
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
ALWAYS
VIEWED
BY
THEM
AS
A
BETTER
FOOTBALL
PLAYER
AND
ONLY
SOSO
AT
BASEBALL
HE
DID
ONLY
HAVE
ONE
SEASON
AND
KC
WASNT
WINNING
NOTE
I
MAYBE
HAVE
HARPED
ON
THIS
A
BIT
IN
THE
PAST
BUT
THERE
IS
A
MISTAKE
BEING
MADE
BY
THE
SDCNS
AS
THEY
ARE
KNOWN
ON
THIS
GROUP
WITH
RESPECT
TO
PLAYERS
LIKE
BO
AND
DEION
AND
LOFTON
AND
PERHAPS
OTHERS
WE
FIND
THAT
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
A
LARGE
GROUP
OF
PLAYERS
THEIR
PAST
MAJOR
AND
MINOR
LEAGUE
NUMBERS
WILL
PREDICT
THEIR
FUTURE
NUMBERS
FAIRLY
WELL
THEIR
ARE
SOME
CAVEATS
THE
YOUNGER
THEY
ARE
THE
LESS
GOOD
THE
PREDICTION
THE
LOWER
THE
MINOR
LEAGUE
THE
LESS
GOOD
I
IMAGINE
THE
MORE
RECENT
THE
PLAYER
HAS
LEFT
COLLEGE
BALL
ETC
NOW
OF
COURSE
THIS
PREDICTION
INVOLVES
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
ERROR
SOMETIMES
A
PLAYER
WITH
POOR
MLES
DAVE
JUSTICE
THE
VENTURA
BECOMES
A
STAR
SOME
HITTERS
DEVELOP
SHANE
MACK
BRIAN
DOWNING
SOME
DONT
ODDIBE
MCDOWELL
MICKEY
BRANTLEY
THIS
ERROR
INVOLVES
REAL
THINGS
THERE
ARE
REAL
REASONS
WHY
ODDIBE
DIDNT
HIT
AND
SHANE
DID
IT
MAY
WHO
KNOWS
INVOLVE
PARKS
AND
BATTING
COACHES
AND
WHEATIES
AND
INJURIES
AND
LIFTING
AND
SO
ON
BUT
STILL
YOU
HAVE
THIS
BIG
POOL
OF
PLAYERS
AND
THINGS
WORK
PRETTY
WELL
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
FOR
THESE
PREDICTIONS
ACCURACY
IS
THE
COMMON
BACKGROUND
OF
THE
PLAYERS
ONE
THING
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
PROFESSIONAL
BASEBALL
PLAYERS
IS
THAT
ALL
OF
THEM
OR
ALMOST
ALL
HAVE
SPENT
A
GOOD
DEAL
OF
TIME
PLAYING
BALL
THEIR
BACKGROUNDS
ARE
SIMILAR
WHAT
HASNT
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
IS
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
YOU
ENCOUNTER
A
PLAYER
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
BACKGROUND
IS
THERE
SOME
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
A
BO
OR
A
DEION
OR
A
LOFTON
OR
A
TONY
GWYNN
OR
AN
AINGE
OR
SO
ON
HAS
SUCH
A
DIFFERENT
BACKGROUND
THAT
THE
STANDARD
MODEL
AND
STANDARD
ASSUMPTIONS
FIT
THIS
PERSON
SLOWLY
IT
HASNT
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
THAT
YOU
CAN
USE
MLES
WITH
TWOSPORT
PLAYERS
IT
HASNT
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
THAT
YOU
CANT
BUT
THEN
STATISTICS
IS
AFTER
ALL
AN
ART
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
OTHERWISE
LUCID
INDIVIDUALS
CONTINUALLY
MAKE
COMPLETELY
NONSENSICAL
STATEMENTS
ABOUT
BO
AND
DEION
AND
LOFTON
LOOK
AT
THOSE
GOODBUTNOTGREAT
MINOR
LEAGUE
NUMBERS
THEY
SAY
WELL
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
THOSE
NUMBERS
SIMPLY
DONT
MEAN
WHAT
THEY
USUALLY
MEAN
IT
MIGHT
MEAN
THAT
KEN
LOFTON
SUDDENLY
HAS
A
BETTER
YEAR
IN
HOUSTON
THAN
TUSCON
IT
MIGHT
MEAN
THAT
DEION
SUDDENLY
HAS
A
BETTER
HALFYEAR
IN
ATLANTA
THAN
GREENVILLE
THEN
AGAIN
IT
MIGHT
NOT
KEN
AND
DEION
MIGHT
GO
RIGHT
BACK
IN
THE
TANK
THIS
YEAR
LIVE
UP
TO
THOSE
POOR
MLES
BUT
YOU
GUYS
DONT
KNOW
WHATS
WORSE
YOU
DONT
KNOW
THAT
YOU
DONT
AND
YOU
DONT
KNOW
THAT
THERE
ARE
OTHER
PLAYERS
YOU
WONT
KNOW
ABOUT
INJURIES
AND
LIFTING
AND
WHEATIES
AGAIN
YOU
SEEM
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
MODEL
IS
PERFECT
AND
ETERNAL
ITS
NOT
ITS
GOT
SOME
ERROR
OH
WELL
BILL
GUILFORD
STILL
THINKS
HAIRY
BUTT
IS
TRULY
UGLY
MIGHT
BE
RIGHT
