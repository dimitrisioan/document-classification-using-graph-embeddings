name
three
exmet
pitchers
that
have
lost
to
every
team
in
the
majors
except
colorado
and
florida
which
two
also
defeated
every
team
in
the
majors
dan
nolan
ryan
qualifies
on
both
counts
i
would
guess
that
viola
is
the
other
one
who
has
beaten
and
also
lost
to
every
team
in
the
majors
viola
has
only
played
in
the
nl
with
the
mets
not
possible
for
him
to
have
defeated
or
lost
to
every
team
ditto
for
tanana
who
was
mentioned
in
a
previous
post
the
pitcher
to
lose
to
every
team
is
probably
tom
seaver
but
it
could
be
koosman
i
dont
remember
if
seaver
managed
to
get
a
win
against
the
white
sox
in
his
brief
sojourn
with
boston
so
id
say
the
other
pitcher
to
defeat
every
team
is
either
mike
torrez
he
bounced
around
enough
for
a
long
enough
period
of
time
or
koosman
as
mentioned
i
would
also
guess
that
if
one
of
these
two
did
not
manage
to
beat
every
team
he
did
manage
to
lose
to
every
team
