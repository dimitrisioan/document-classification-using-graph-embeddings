ANDRE
TREMENDOUS
BAT
SPEED
DAWSON
BAT
SPEED
SO
GREAT
THAT
DAWSON
HAS
TROUBLE
HITTING
THE
BALL
TO
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
OF
THE
LEFT
FIELD
LINE
WITHOUT
COUNTING
TO
BEFORE
SWINGING
BAT
SPEED
NEVER
BEFORE
SEEN
FROM
A
MAN
MUCH
LESS
FROM
ANY
RED
SOX
PLAYER
TO
PRECEDE
HIM
YES
THATS
HIM
WAS
I
NOT
SPECIFIC
ENOUGH
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
CONSISTENTLY
PULLS
THE
BALL
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
QUICK
BAT
DAWSONS
RELEASE
IS
SLOW
AND
HE
IS
AFTER
ALL
HE
MAY
SWING
EARLY
AND
ROTATE
HIS
HIPS
SO
THAT
HE
HITS
THE
BALL
TO
THE
LEFT
SIDE
ALL
THE
TIME
BUT

SWINGS

THAT
RAY
KNIGHT
HAS
THE
IQ
OF
DRAINED
CRANKCASE
OIL

OUTSIDE
THAT
WAS
RIGHT
DOWN
THE
BLEEDIN
PIPE
BALDER
THAN
ANY
KENNY
I
REALIZE
I
DONT
HAVE
GREAT
CONTROL
BUT
DAVE
ON
THE
NET
CMON
GARY
THAT
WAS
A
STYROFOAM
CUP
THE
REALLY
PLATES
A
FOOT
TO
YOUR
RIGHT
THROW
THE
BALL
