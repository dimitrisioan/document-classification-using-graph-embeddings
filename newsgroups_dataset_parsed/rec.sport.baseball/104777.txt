WEEKENDS
FOURGAME
SERIES
WAS
A
REALLY
STRANGE
ONE
YUP
I
WAS
WONDERING
THE
WHOLE
TIME
WHY
THE
BRAVES
MOST
TALENTED
OUTFIELDER
NEON
DEON
WAS
NOT
STARTING
HERES
WHOA
ARENT
YOU
FORGETTING
A
COUPLE
OF
GUYS
NAMED
GANT
AND
JUSTICE
A
GUY
WHO
CAN
HIT
HRS
LEADOFF
AND
STEAL

CAN
LEAD
OFF

GUYS
LIKE
NIXON
AND
BREAM
AHEAD
OF
HIM
I
CANT

THAT
ADVANTAGE
OF

A
BETTER
DEFENSIVE
OUTFIELDER

THINK

HYPE

SEASON
LAST
YEAR

GOOD
BUT
IM
NOT
CONVINCED
THAT
HE
CAN
DO
IT
AGAIN
IT
REMINDS
ME
SORRY
OF
THE
YEAR
WHEN
TIM
WALLACH
HIT

SO
HOMERS

HAD
RBI

NEVER
EVEN
CAME
CLOSE
TO
HAPPENING
AGAIN
OF
COURSE

JUST
PREFER

ABOUT
THEIR
BUSINESS

DONT
PLAY
