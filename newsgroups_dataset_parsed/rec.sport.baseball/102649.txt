IVE
SAID
THE
BRAVES
WOULD
IMPROVE
BY
INJURY
AS
WELL
HERES
HOW
JAVIER
LOPEZ
IS
A
BETTER
CATCHER
THAN
GREG
OLSON
RYAN
KLASKO

A
BETTER
FIRSTBASEMAN
THAN
BREAM
CHIPPER
JONES

A
BETTER
SHORTSTOP
THAN
ANYONE
THE

PUT
OUT
THERE
MEL
NIEVES
IS
BETTER
THAN
NIXONSANDERS
THATS
HOW
IT
FORCES
THEM
TO
PLAY
THE
YOUNG
GUYS
BOB
GAJ
I
CONTINUE
TO
BE
AMAZED
AT
THESE
COMMENTS
WHILE
LOPEZ
MIGHT
SOME
DAY
BE
A
BETTER
CATCHER
THAN
OLSON
I
FIND
IT
TOTALLY
AMAZING
FOR
YOU
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THIS
YEAROLD
WITH
THREE
SEASONS
OF
PROFESSIONAL
BASEBALL
IS
NOW
BETTER
THAN
OLSON
A
FIVEYEAR
MLB
VETERAN
WHO
IS
NOTED
FOR
HIS
ABILITY
TO
CALL
A
GAME
AND
WHO
HAS
A
BETTERTHANAVERAGE
ARM
OH
PERHAPS
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
HITTING
WELL
SURE
LOPEZ
MIGHT
HIT
BETTER
PERHAPS
HE
PROBABLY
WILL
BUT
HAS
THERE
EVER
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
BASEBALL
BEEN
A
OR
YOUNGER
ROOKIE
CATCHER
WHO
COMPARED
FAVORABLY
AMONG
ALL
LEAGUE
CATCHERS
IN
TERMS
OF
DEFENSE
AND
BROUGHT
A

WASNT

YES
IVAN

FOR
A

FROM

LAST
YEAR
SANDY
ALOMAR
WHO
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THAT
GOOD
IN
HIS
ROOKIE

NOT
WASNT
IT
BENITO
SANTIAGO
WHO
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THAT
GOOD
IN
HIS
ROOKIE
YEAR
NOT
I
CAN
CONTINUE
THIS
THREAD
WITH
THE
OTHERS
MENTIONED
BUT
YOU
GET
THE
POINT
YOU
AND
OTHERS
SEEM
TO
BE
SO
QUICK
TO
DISMISS
THE
SEASONED
VETERANS
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
HOT
YOUNG
ROOKIES
PERHAPS
JUST
PERHAPS
THE
MANAGEMENT
TEAM
OF
THE
PENNANTWINNING
BRAVES
KNOWS
SOMETHING
MORE
THAN
YOU
DO
AND
PERHAPS
WHAT
THEY
KNOW
IS
THAT
VERY
VERY
FEW

OLD
ROOKIES
COME
