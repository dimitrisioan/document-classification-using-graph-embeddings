RE
PHILLIES
SIGN
MARK
DAVIS
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THEY
HAVE
TO
PAY
HIS
SALARY
DIDNT
THEY
WAIT
FOR
HIM
TO
CLEAR
WAIVERS
IF
NOT
WHY
NOT
DAVIS
WILL
BE
PAID
BY
THREE
CLUBS
THIS
YEAR
I
THINK
THE
PHILS
ARE
RESPONSBIBLE
FOR
ABOUT
OR
SO
THEY
DIDNT
WAIT
FOR
HIM
TO
CLEAR
WAIVERS
AS
THREE
OTHER
CLUBS
WERE
ALSO
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
HIM
A
GAMBLE
YES
OH
IT
WILL
AS
A
ROYALS
FAN
I
AM
SKEPTICAL
THEY
SAY
HE
PITCHED
WELL
IN
WINTER
BALL
HE
ALSO
PITCHED
WELL
AT
OMAHA
WHILE
WITH
KC
HE
JUST
DIDNT
PITCH
WELL
OR
EVEN
ACCEPTABLY
WHEN
IN
THE
MAJORS
I
DONT
HAVE
HIS
ATLANTA
STATS
BUT
HE
MUST
NOT
HAVE
IMPRESSED
THEM
VERY
MUCH
EITHER
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
YEAR
WHEN
HE
GOT
SAVES
IN
SAN
DIEGO
DID
HE
PITCH
WELL
THEN
OK
I
KNOW
HE
WAS
AWFUL
THE
NEXT
YEAR
WHEN
HE
WENT
TO
KC
BUT
STILL
WON
THE
CY
YOUNG
TOO
FOR
THAT
YEAR
