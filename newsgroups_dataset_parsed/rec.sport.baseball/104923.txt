last
year
the
american
league
scored
runs
in
games
for
a
total
of
runs
per

with
hrgame
through
tuesday
the
al
has
runs
in
games
for
a
total
of
runs
per
game
and
a
total
of
hrgame
in
there
were
runs
per
game
and
hrgame
the
big
question
how
significant
is
this
have
we
returned
to
or
is
this
just
a
minor
abberation
some
thoughts
d
i
thought
offense
was
generally
down
in
april
rising
as
the
weather
got
warm
and
pitchers
got
tired
this
may
be
a
bigger
abberation
from
the
norm
than
it
seems
i
dont
get
a
feeling
that
the
weather
has
been
an
issue
this
year
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
really
cold
spell
in
north
america
which
does
makes
it
harder
to
hit
not
to
mention
making
the
ball
carry
less
you
obviously
did
not
watch
the
twins
in
chicago
no
cold
spell
its
been
snowing
most
of
the
week
in
minnesota
inches
in
duluth
last
weekend
i
would
still
put
things
under
the
too
early
to
tell
