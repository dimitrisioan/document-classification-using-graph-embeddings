RON
GANT
STALLING
AND
HIRSCHBECK
DALE
SEER
STEPHENSON
WRITES
WHILE
I
CAN
SEE
WHY
THEY
WANT
TO
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
TIME
SPENT
WALKING
AROUND
GANT
WASNT
ORDERED
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
SOONER
HE
WAS
ORDERED
BACK
IMMEDIATELY
AS
SOON
AS
HE
STEPPED
OUT
HIRSCHBECK
TOLD
HIM
TO
GET
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
NOW
GANT
DOESNT
TAKE
A
LOT
OF
WALKS
BETWEEN
PITCHES
THE
ONLY
REASON
HE
DID
THEN
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
VERY
BOTHERED
BY
THE
CALL
I
EXPECT
HIS
CONCENTRATION
WASNT
THERE
YET
AND
IN
A
CRUCIAL
SITUATION
I
IMAGINE
ITS
BEST
TO
BE
AS
CALM
AS
POSSIBLE
CONTRIBUTING
FACTORS
WOULD
BE
GANTS
BAD
DAY
AT
THE
PLATE
BAD
YEAR
AT
THE
PLATE
AND
THE
BRAVES
LONG
SCORING
DROUGHT
AND
IT
IS
NOT
HIRSCHBECKS
JOB
TO
HELP
GANT
WITH
ANY
OF
THESE
DIFFICULTIES
IF
GANT
CANT
GATHER
HIS
CONCENTRATION
FOR
WHATEVER
REASON
THAT
JUST
MAKES
HIM
ALL
THE
MORE
MEAT
IN
THE
BATTERS
BOX
THE
UMPIRES
JOB
IS
TO
MAINTAIN
FLOW
OF
PLAY
GANT
IS
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
TIME
TO
REGATHER
HIS
FACULTIES
NOR
IS
ANYONE
ELSE
NOW
ITS
PRETTY
STUPID
TO
GO
AHEAD
AND
TALK
THE
WALK
WHEN
THE
UMPIRE
IS
TELLING
YOU
TO
GET
IN
THERE
YOU
KNOW
THE
UMPIRE
IS
GOING
TO
DO
SOMETHING
CALL
FOR
A
STRIKE
THROW
YOU
OUT
ETC
GANT
WAS
WRONG
ABSOLUTELY
I
THINK
ITD
BE
MORE
ACCURATE
TO
SAY
GANT
WAS
FOOLISH
BUT
HIRSCHBECK
WAS
MORE
WRONG
IN
MY
BIASED
VIEW
ASIDE
FROM
THE
MAJOR
CHIP
HE
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
ON
HIS
SHOULDER
WHAT
WAS
THE
PROBLEM
GANT
HAD
A
REASON
TO
WANT
SOME
TIME
DISPUTED
STRIKE
CALL
IF
A
DISPUTED
STRIKE
CALL
IS
AMPLE
REASON
FOR
A
TIMEOUT
GAMES
WOULD
LAST
ABOUT
NINEFIFTEEN
WEEKS
IF
JACK
MORRIS
OR
DAVE
WHINER
STIEB
WERE
PITCHING
A
DISPUTED
STRIKE
CALL
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
FOR
A
TIME
OUT
SUCK
IT
UP
GET
BACK
IN
THE
BOX
AND
NEVER
BADMOUTH
THE
BLUE
THEYRE
NOT
GOING
TO
CHANGE
THEIR
MIND
AND
YOURE
JUST
GOING
TO
COME
ACROSS
AS
A
PINHEAD
WHICH
WONT
HELP
YOU
WITH
THE
BORDERLINE
CALLS
FTR
I
NEVER
SPEAK
TO
UMPIRES
WHEN
I
DONT
KNOW
THEM
PERSONALLY
NOR
DO
I
GLANCE
AT
THEM
OR
REACT
TO
CALLS
AS
A
RESULT
I
THINK
I
GET
MORE
THAN
MY
FAIR
SHARE
OF
BORDERLINE
CALLS
AT
THE
PLATE
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
A
REP
OF
HAVING
A
GOOD
EYE
ACTUALLY
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
NEGATIVE
CONNOTATIONS
THAT
GO
WITH
THAT
REP
INCLUDING
COPIOUS
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
MY
MASCULINITY
PARTY
AFFILIATION
AND
SEXUAL
PREFERENCE
GANT
HADNT
BEEN
WASTING
TIME
ALL
GAME
THE
GAME
HAD
BEEN
CRUISING
ALONG
AND
WAS
JUST
OVER
TWO
HOURS
OLD
IRRELEVANT
HE
WAS
WASTING
TIME
THEN
THE
SCORE
WAS
WITH
OUTS
IN
THE
NINTH
AND
A
RUNNER
IN
SCORING
POSITION
IS
THERE
ANY
REASON
HIRSCHBECK
COULDNT
AND
SHOULDNT
CUT
GANT
A
LITTLE
SLACK
BECAUSE
ITS
NOT
HIS
JOB
BECAUSE
SETTING
THE
PRECEDENT
OF
CUTTING
SLACK
THERE
CAN
EASILY
EXTEND
TO
THOSE
HOUR
GAMES
KIND
OF
LIKE
THE
PHANTOM
DP
FOR
NO
DISCERNIBLE
CONSTRUCTIVE
REASON
HIRSCHBECK
DISRUPTED
THE
GAME
CAUSED
A
FIVE
MINUTE
DELAY
AND
MATERIALLY
HURT
THE
BATTER
IN
A
KEY
SITUATION
DID
HE
HAVE
A
DATE
TO
GET
TO
GANT
HURT
HIMSELF
AND
THE
BRAVES
DISRUPTED
THE
GAME
YOUR
BIASES
ARE
EXPOSED
AND
IM
SITTING
HERE
DEFENDING
UMPIRES
AND
THE
SF
GIANTS
WHICH
IS
LIKE
PHYLLIS
SCHLAFLY
DEFENDING
GARY
SEGURA
JACK
KEVORKIAN
AND
THE
SWEDISH
ABORTION
TEAM
AND
I
STILL
WONDER
WHY
TERRY
WAS
TOSSED
EARLIER
IN
THE
GAME
I
BELIEVE
TERRY
SAID
THE
MAGIC
WORD
THERE
ARE
SOME
TRULY
QUICK
WAYS
TO
GET
TOSSED
FROM
A
BALLGAME
FOR
A
PRIMER
EMAIL
ME
GOOD
WAYS
TO
GET
TOSSED
FROM
A
GAME
ASK
KEN
KAISER
IF
HE
GOT
HIS
MONEY
BACK
FROM
NUTRISYSTEM
KISS
