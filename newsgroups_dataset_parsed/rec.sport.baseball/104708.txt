before
folks
jump
on
me
let
me
ask
the
net
would
the
jays
have
won
the
al
with
a
good
pitcher
from
aaa
in
place
of
morris
given
his
run
support
how
about
an
average
ml
pitcher
i
cant
believe
that
morris
performance
in
the
playoffs
and
series
had
a
large
positive
impact
on
the
jays
performance
i
know
its
very
trendy
nowadays
to
dump
on
morris
but
lets
give
credit
where
credit
is
due
it
is
doubtful
that
the
blue
jays
would
have
won
the
al
east
without
morris
last
year
when
the
team
went
for
the
month
of
august
and
all
the
other
starters
were
being
shelled
and
milwaukee
was
making
a
charge
morris
went
with
a
pretty
good
era
i
cant
remember
exactly
also
lets
not
underestimate
the
importance
his
innings
to
save
the
bullpen
every
fifth
day
if
he
didnt
help
us
win
the
al
east
forget
about
the
pennent
and
the
world
series
his
run
support
was
high
runs
but
so
was
stottlemyers
runs
and
he
won
only
games
i
do
remember
morris
winning
an
inordinate
number
of
and
ballgames
but
this
is
to
his
credit
he
pitched
only
as
good
as
he
needed
to
be
when
he
was
up
in
a
ballgame
he
just
put
it
in
cruise
control
and
threw
the
ball
up
there
and
let
the
batters
get
themseleves
out
i
hate
this
expression
an
inexperienced
pitcher
would
wear
himself
out
trying
to
make
perfect
pitches
to
keep
his
era
down
but
morris
being
a
veteran
pitcher
knows
that
winning
is
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
in
baseball
by
saving
himself
he
was
able
to
reach
back
for
that
little
extra
i
hate
this
too
when
the
game
was
on
the
line
yes
morris
is
crapping
out
big
time
this
year
but
lets
not
change
history
to
suit
the
present
btw
i
think
he
should
be
put
in
the
bullpen
it
would
be
embarrassing
a
veteran
pitcher
which
cito
would
never
do
but
his
era
is
how
much
more
can
he
be
embarrassed
from
where
i
sit
ill
let
others
have
the
excellent
players
ill
settle
for
good
enough
and
the
ring
