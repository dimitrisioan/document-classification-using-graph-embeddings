joe
robbie
stadium
not
for
baseball
date
apr
gmt
did
anyone
notice
the
words
not
for
baseball
printed
on
the
picture
of
joe
robbie
stadium
in
the
opening
day
season
preview
section
in
usa
today
any
reason
given
for
this
i
would
assume
that
the
words
i
saw
the
picture
indicated
that
those
seats
will
not
be
available
for
baseball
games
if
you
look
at
the
picture
of
the
diamond
in
the
stadium
in
relation
to
the
areas
marked
not
for
baseball
those
seats
just
look
terrible
for
watching
baseball
now
if
they
should
happen
to
reach
the
postseason
i
would
imagine
that
they
would
consider
opening
some
of
those
seats
up
but
that
is
surely
a
worry
of
the
future
sam
lubchansky
in
the
champion
people
see
what
theyd
like
to
be
in
the
loser
they
see
what
they
actually
are
and
they
treat
him
with
scorn
sugary
condiments
secure
initial
pleasure
but
fermented
grain
is
decidedly
more
parsimonious
of
time
