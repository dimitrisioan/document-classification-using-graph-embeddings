WINFIELD
CANT
TOUCH
FRANK
ROBINSON
OR
MEL
OTT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
YOUD
ALSO
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
CONVINCING
ME
TO
RATE
HIM
BETTER
THAN
OR
EQUAL
TO
CLEMENTE
TWO
SETS
OF
NUMBERS
CAREER
EQUIVALENT
AVERAGE
AND
EQUIVALENT
RUNS
RUTH
AARON
OTT
ROBINSON
CLEMENTE
WINFIELD
RUTH
IS
IN
A
CLASS
BY
HIMSELF
FOR
BOTH
RATE
EQA
AND
TOTAL
EQR
PERFORMANCE
AARON
RUNS
OVER
EVERYBODY
IN
THE
TOTAL
CATEGORY
OTT
AND
ROBINSON
WHO
LEAD
WINFIELD
IN
BOTH
CATEGORIES
COULD
BE
SAFELY
PUT
AHEAD
OF
AHEAD
OF
HIM
REGGIE
TOO
ALTHOUGH
HE
IS
BARELY
AHEAD
THESE
NUMBERS
ARE
NORMALIZED
FOR
LEAGUE
AND
PARK
CLEMENTE
IS
HELD
DOWN
BY
SOME
REALLY
ANEMIC
OFFENSIVE
PRODUCTION
IN
HIS
EARLIEST
YEARS
AND
WAS
STILL
PRODUCTIVE
WHEN
HE
DIED
IT
IS
REASONABLY
SAFE
TO
ASSUME
HE
HAD
RUNS
MORE
HE
COULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
STILL
JACKSON
WANER
CLEMENTE
AND
WINFIELD
FORM
A
PRETTY
TIGHT
KNOT
YES
BUT
A
WE
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
PEAK
LEVEL
NOT
CAREER
AVERAGES
AND
B
CLEMENTE
WAS
THE
BEST
FIELDING
RF
OF
ALL
TIME
AS
FAR
AS
ANYONE
CAN
TELL
I
DID
A
QUICK
SCAN
LAST
NIGHT
LOOKING
FOR
PLAYERS
WITH
A
PEAK
COMPARABLE
TO
OR
BETTER
THAN
WINFIELD
IN
MY
QUICKNDIRTY
SUBJECTIVE
JUDGEMENT
YOU
COULD
MAKE
GOOD
CASES
FOR
RUTH
AARON
OTT
ROBINSON
CLEMENTE
KALINE
MARIS
KLEIN
JACKSON
WANER
AND
PROBABLY
A
FEW
OTHERS
THIS
IS
NOT
A
KNOCK
ON
WINFIELD
BUT
A
COMMENT
ON
HIS
CONSISTENCY
ALL
OF
THOSE
OTHER
PLAYERS
HAD
AWESOME
STRETCHES
AND
VERY
GOOD
STRETCHES
WHILE
WINFIELD
HAS
BEEN
MORE
UNIFORMLY
EXCELLENT
HALL
OF
FAME
ABSOLUTELY
PEAK
IM
NOT
SO
SURE
TOP
TOTAL

YES
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
DAVID

TATE
MY
FREE
AGENT
SAYS
HE
WILL
BE
NO
ONES

MINE
DTATEPITTEDU
NOT
EVEN
SHOULD
STEINBRENNER
HIMSELF
TRY
TO
SEDUCE
HIM
PROF
