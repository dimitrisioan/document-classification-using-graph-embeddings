SHERRI
NICHOLS
WRITES
MIGHT
I
SUGGEST
THAT
A
MORE
APPROPRIATE
FORUM
FOR
GAMEBYGAME
HIGHLIGHTS
OF
A
PARTICULAR
TEAM
IS
A
MAILING
LIST
RATHER
THAN
RECSPORTBASEBALL
I
LOOKED
UP
MIGHT
TO
SEE
WHY
YOU
SELECTED
THAT
PARTICULAR
WORD
AND
DISCOVERED
THE
LINE
TO
EXPRESS
PERMISSION
LIBERTY
PROBABILITY
POSSIBILITY
IT
ALSO
SAID
SOMETHING
ABOUT
BEING
A
POLITE
ALTERNATIVE
TO
MAY
THE
PRESENCE
OF
PROBABILITY
POSSIBILITY
CAN
CERTAINLY
BE
USED
TO
PARTIALLY
EXPLAIN
YOUR
WORD
SELECTION
SO
ID
SAY
TO
ALL
EXTENTS
AND
PURPOSES
YES
YOU
MIGHT
IN
FACT
YOU
DID
NOT
THAT
YOU
WERE
ASKING
ME
SPECIFICALLY
THE
NEXT
QUESTION
IS
WHY
WOULD
A
MAILING
LIST
BE
MORE
APPROPRIATE
WE
DONT
ALL
GET
MAILING
LISTS
WE
SURELY
DONT
ALL
GET
MAILING
LISTS
ABOUT
THE
TEAMS
ABOUT
WHICH
WE
ARE
MOST
ENTHUSED
SO
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
RSBASEBALL
IS
AN
APPROPRIATE
PLACE
TO
LOOK
FOR
INFORMATION
ABOUT
TEAMS
ONE
DOESNT
NECESSARILY
FOLLOW
DAYTODAY
THIS
IS
NOT
INTENDED
AS
FLAMAGE
BUT
RATHER
IS
AN
ATTEMPTED
ANSWER
AS
YOU
POSED
YOUR
POST
AS
A
