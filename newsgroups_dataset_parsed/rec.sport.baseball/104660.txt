UPDATE

WRITES
I
AGREE
THAT
HIRSCHBECK
WAS
JUST
DOING
WHAT
HE
WAS
INSTRUCTED
TO
DO
AND
ALSO
THAT
GANT
SHOULD
HAVE
LISTENED
TO
HIM
HOWEVER
WHAT
IS
WITH
THIS
POLICY
OF
TRYING
TO
SPEED
UP
THE
GAMES
YOU
ARE
THE
FIRST
PERSON
NONMEDIOT
I
HAVE
SEEN
ENDORSE
THIS
POLICY
I
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
ENDORSE
IT
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
LENGTH
OF
GAMES
AT
ALL
AND
AM
TIRED
OF
THE
ESPN
CROWD
AND
OTHER
ANNOUNCERS
BITCHING
ABOUT
IT
I
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
IN
A
BALLPARK
FILLED
WITH
PEOPLE
LOOKING
AT
THEIR
WATCHES
AND
SHOUTING
HURRY
UP
IF
I
COUGH
UP
BIG
BUCKS
FOR
A
TICKET
I
DONT
MIND
A
GAME
THAT
LAST
MORE
THAN
I
REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IT
HAVENT
BEEN
TO
MANY
AS
GAMES
HAVE
YOU
SERIOUSLY
I
DONT
MIND
A
BASEBALL
GAME
THAT
LASTS
A
LONG
TIME
IF
IT
LASTS
A
LONG
TIME
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
GOOD
BASEBALL
BEING
PLAYED
HOWEVER
I
DONT
LIKE
GAMES
THAT
TAKE
HOURS
BECAUSE
THERES
A
LOT
OF
DEAD
TIME
GOING
ON
IN
THAT
GAME
I
DONT
FIND
ANYTHING
EXCITING
ABOUT
WATCHING
BATTER
OR
PITCHER
WANDER
AROUND
BETWEEN
PITCHES
OR
WATCHING
THE
CATCHER
MAKE
A
SLOW
WALK
TO
THE
MOUND
OR
WATCHING
LOTS
OF
PITCHER
CHANGES
FOR
NO
GOOD
REASON
WHITEY
HERZOG
USED
TO
BE
THE
MASTER
OF
THIS
THE
GAME
COULD
BE
WAY
OUT
OF
REACH
AND
HED
STILL
BE
MAKING
SWITCHES
FOR
PLATOON
ADVANTAGE
I
WANT
TO
SEE
THE
GAME
NOT
PEOPLE
STANDING
AROUND
I
DONT
REALLY
ENJOY
WATCHING
NFL
FOOTBALL
GAMES
IN
PERSON
FOR
EXAMPLE
BECAUSE
THERES
SO
MUCH
DEAD
TIME
YOU
DONT
REALLY
NOTICE
HOW
MUCH
DEAD
TIME
THERE
IS
IF
YOU
WATCH
IT
ON
TELEVISION
BECAUSE
THEYRE
BUSY
SHOWING
YOU
REPLAYS
I
DONT
LIKE
THAT
COLLEGE
BASKETBALL
GAMES
HAVE
SO
MANY
TIME
OUTS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
GAME
THE
NCAA
HAS
MADE
SOME
MOVES
TO
TRY
TO
ALLEVIATE
THIS
PROBLEM
FOR
NEXT
YEAR
THEYRE
GOING
TO
STOP
THE
CLOCK
AFTER
MADE
BASKETS
LATE
IN
GAMES
NEXT
YEAR
AND
THEYRE
GOING
TO
A
SECOND
CLOCK
THERES
ALSO
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
HOW
TOLERANT
I
AM
OF
LONG
GAMES
IF
IM
WATCHING
THEM
ON
THE
TUBE
AND
IF
IM
GOING
THERE
IN
PERSON
FOR
ME
GOING
TO
AN
AS
GAME
HAS
BECOME
A
MAJOR
COMMITMENT
OF
TIME
ONE
THAT
IM
NOT
WILLING
TO
MAKE
THAT
OFTEN
THE
LENGTH
OF
THEIR
GAMES
IS
COSTING
THE
AS
REVENUE
FROM
ME
