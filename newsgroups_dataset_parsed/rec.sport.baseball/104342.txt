and
now
the
not
so
pleasant
surprises
the
book
on
tartabull
was
keep
him
healthy
and
hell
produce
well
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
sure
hes
hit
a
few
homers
but
those
were
all
solo
shots
and
he
hasnt
gotten
any
of
the
big
rbis
that
your
cleanup
man
is
supposed
to
give
you
then
again
he
had
a
slow
start
last
year
once
he
got
off
the
dl
that
is
and
turned
into
a
oneman
wrecking
crew
see
you
in
the
series
alan
lets
see
april
less
than
at
bats
and
you
claim
that
he
hasnt
done
too
much
so
far
cut
this
guy
some
slack
danny
will
produce
this
year
its
scary
to
think
just
how
much
hell
produce
if
he
were
to
stay
healthy
all
year
the
yanks
have
a
lot
going
for
them
this
year
good
starting
rotation
good
bullpen
good
defense
and
a
good
lineup
also
i
like
buck
showalter
frank
howard
on
is
also
a
good
move
everything
sounds
good
so
far
if
the
yanks
stay
healthy
they
have
a
good
chance
at
winning
the
pennant
this
is
the
most
fun
ive
had
watching
the
yanks
since
