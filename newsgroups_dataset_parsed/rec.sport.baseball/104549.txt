left
rbi
fans
and
runs
off
this
list
because
they
are
dependant
on
the
team
to
a
large
extent
if
frank
thomas
hit
first
hed
lose
a
lot
of
rbis
and
anyways
how
many
place
hitters
have
you
known
to
drive
in
runs
doesnt
happen
that
oftenvery
unlikely
with
devon
whites
obp
in
front
of
you
im
pretty
sure
that
sandberg
has
done
this
at
least
once
i
know
someone
will
correct
me
if
im
wrong
rbis
and
runs
scored
are
the
two
most
important
offensive
statistics
you
can
talk
about
obp
and
slg
all
you
want
but
the
fact
remains
the
team
that
scores
more
runs
wins
the
game
flame
away
