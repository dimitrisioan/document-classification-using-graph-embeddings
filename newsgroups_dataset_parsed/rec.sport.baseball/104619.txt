HE
PROBABLY
DIDNT
EVEN
HAVE
AS
GOOD
A
SEASON
AS
ALOMAR
LAST
YEAR
SNIP
UH
YES
BAERGA
HAS
A
LOT
OF
FLASH
BUT
ALOMAR
WAS
THE
BETTER
HITTER
LAST
YEAR
STATS
DELETED
WEVE
ALL
SEEN
THEM
BY
NOW
THIS
IS
FASCINATING
YOU
SAY
THAT
ALOMAR
WAS
THE
BETTER
HITTER
LAST
YEAR
AND
IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOW
THAT
UP
WITH
NUMBERS
SHOWING
THAT
BAERGA
HAD
A
BETTER
YEAR
THE
ONLY
CATEGORY
THAT
I
SEE
WHICH
SHOWS
AN
ADVANTAGE
FOR
ALOMAR
IS
OBP
I
NOMINATE
THIS
LAST
BIT
FOR
ANTISTATHEAD
QUOTE
OF
THE
WEEK
ALOMAR
ONLY
HAS
A
POINT
ADVANTAGE
IN
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
OFFENSIVE
CATEGORY
WHILE
BAERGA
WHO
STUDIED
IN
THE
JOE
CARTER
SCHOOL
OF
OUTBURNING
HAS
MORE
IMPRESSIVE
MEDIOT
STATS
LARGELY
DUE
TO
OPPORTUNITIES
RATHER
THAN
QUALITY
THE
LINES
ARE
FAIRLY
CLOSE
IN
VALUE
BUT
EDGE
TO
ALOMAR
NOW
BAERGA
AINT
CHOPPED
LIVER
BUT
ALOMAR
IS
STILL
THE
MAN
TO
BEAT
