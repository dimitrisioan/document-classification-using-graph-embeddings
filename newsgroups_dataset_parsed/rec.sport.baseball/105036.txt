OF
ALL

AS
FAR
AS
ANYONE
CAN
TELL
I
DID
A
QUICK
SCAN
LAST
NIGHT
LOOKING
FOR
PLAYERS
WITH
A
PEAK
COMPARABLE
TO
OR
BETTER
THAN
WINFIELD
IN
MY
QUICKNDIRTY
SUBJECTIVE
JUDGEMENT
YOU
COULD
MAKE
GOOD
CASES
FOR
RUTH
AARON
OTT
ROBINSON
CLEMENTE
KALINE
MARIS
KLEIN
JACKSON
WANER
AND
PROBABLY
A
FEW
OTHERS
THIS
IS
NOT
A
KNOCK
ON

HIS
CONSISTENCY
ALL
