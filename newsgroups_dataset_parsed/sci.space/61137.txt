a
noop
command
was
sent
to
reset
the
command
loss
timer
to
hours
its
planned
value
during
this
mission
phase
this
activity
is
regularly
reported
in
rons
interesting
posts
could
someone
explain
what
the
command
loss
timer
is
the
command
loss
timer
is
a
timer
that
does
just
what
its
name
says
it
indicates
to
the
probe
that
it
has
lost
its
data
link
for
receiving
commands
upon
expiration
of
the
command
loss
timer
i
believe
the
probe
starts
a
search
for
earth
sequence
involving
antenna
pointing
and
attitude
changes
which
consume
fuel
to
try
to
reestablish
communications
noops
are
sent
periodically
through
those
periods
when
there
are
no
real
commands
to
be
sent
just
so
the
probe
knows
that
we
havent
forgotten
about
it
hope
thats
clear
enough
to
be
comprehensible
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
