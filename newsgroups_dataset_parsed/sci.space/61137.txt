A

COMMAND
WAS
SENT
TO
RESET
THE

LOSS
TIMER
TO
HOURS
ITS
PLANNED
VALUE
DURING
THIS

PHASE
THIS

IS
REGULARLY
REPORTED
IN

COULD
SOMEONE
EXPLAIN
WHAT
THE
COMMAND
LOSS
TIMER
IS
THE
COMMAND
LOSS
TIMER
IS
A
TIMER
THAT
DOES
JUST
WHAT
ITS
NAME
SAYS
IT
INDICATES
TO
THE
PROBE
THAT
IT
HAS
LOST
ITS
DATA
LINK
FOR
RECEIVING
COMMANDS
UPON
EXPIRATION
OF
THE

I
BELIEVE
THE

STARTS

NOOPS
ARE
SENT
PERIODICALLY
THROUGH
THOSE

WHEN
THERE
ARE
NO
REAL
COMMANDS
TO
BE
SENT
JUST
SO
THE
PROBE
KNOWS
THAT
WE
HAVENT
FORGOTTEN
ABOUT
IT
HOPE
THATS
CLEAR
ENOUGH
TO
BE
COMPREHENSIBLE
INSISTING
ON
