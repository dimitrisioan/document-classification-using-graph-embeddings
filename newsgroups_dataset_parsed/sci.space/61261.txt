solid

vs

davis
nicoll
sez
hmmm
i
seem
to
recall
that
the
attraction
of
solid
state
record
players
and
radios
in
the
wasnt
better
performance
but
lower
perunit
cost
than
vacuumtube
systems
id
buy
that
for
two
reasons
the
tubes
for
tvs
and
radios
if
you
can
still
find
them
are
usually
or
more
expensive
than
comparable
transistors
also
ask
any
electricguitar
enthusiast
which
type
of
amp
they
prefer
and
theyll
tell
you
tubetype
since
tubes
have
lower
distortion
and
noise
than
transistors
course
most
of
your
electric
guitar
types
just
say
tubes
sound
better
dude
also
transistors
have
the
advantage
in
both
wasteheat
and
energyuse
mainly
because
of
the
heaters
on
the
cathodes
of
the
tubes
