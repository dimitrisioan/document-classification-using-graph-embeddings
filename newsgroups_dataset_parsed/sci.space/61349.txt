BURSTERS
WHERE
ARE
THEY
IN
ARTICLE
JBATKADESIREWRIGHTEDU
WRITES
I
ASSUME
THAT
CAN
ONLY
BE
GUESSED
AT
BY
THE
ASSUMED
ENERGY
OF
THE
EVENT
AND
THE
LAW
SO
IF
THE
LAW
IS
INCORRECT
ASSUME
SOME
UNKNOWN
MATERIAL
DARK
MATTER
INHIBITS
GAMMA
RAY
PROPAGATION
COULD
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
THAT
WE
ARE
ACTUALLY
SEEING
MUCH
LESS
ENERGETIC
EVENTS
HAPPENING
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
US
THE
EVEN
DISTRIBUTION
COULD
BE
CAUSED
BY
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
PROPAGATION
DISTANCE
OF
GAMMA
RAYS
BEING
SHORTER
THEN
THE
THICKNESS
OF
THE
DISK
OF
THE
GALAXY
I
BELIEVE
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
THEORY
IS
THAT
WE
SEE
GAMMARAY
SOURCES
AT
THAT
ENERGY
RANGE
AND
THEIR
ENERGY
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
SIGNIFICANTLY
ABSORBED
