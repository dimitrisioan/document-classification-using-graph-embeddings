controversial
questions
these
issues
periodically
come
up
with
much
argument
and
few
facts
being
offered
the
summaries
below
attempt
to
represent
the
position
on
which
much
of
the
net
community
has
settled
please
dont
bring
them
up
again
unless
theres
something
truly
new
to
be
discussed
the
net
cant
set
public
policy
thats
what
your
representatives
are
for
what
happened
to
the
saturn
v
plans
despite
a
widespread
belief
to
the
contrary
the
saturn
v
blueprints
have
not
been
lost
they
are
kept
at
marshall
space
flight
center
on
microfilm
the
problem
in
recreating
the
saturn
v
is
not
finding
the
drawings
it
is
finding
vendors
who
can
supply
vintage
hardware
like
guidance
system
components
and
the
fact
that
the
launch
pads
and
vab
have
been
converted
to
space
shuttle
use
so
you
have
no
place
to
launch
from
by
the
time
you
redesign
to
accommodate
available
hardware
and
remodify
the
launch
pads
you
may
as
well
have
started
from
scratch
with
a
clean
sheet
design
why
data
from
space
missions
isnt
immediately
available
investigators
associated
with
nasa
missions
are
allowed
exclusive
access
for
one
year
after
the
data
is
obtained
in
order
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
analyze
the
data
and
publish
results
without
being
scooped
by
people
uninvolved
in
the
mission
however
nasa
frequently
releases
examples
in
nondigital

risks

power
sources
for
space
probes
there
has
been
extensive
discussion
on
this
topic
sparked
by
attempts
to
block
the
galileo
and
ulysses
launches
on
grounds
of
the
plutonium
thermal
sources
being
dangerous
numerous
studies
claim
that
even
in
worstcase
scenarios
shuttle
explosion
during
launch
or
accidental
reentry
at
interplanetary
velocities
the
risks
are
extremely
small
two
interesting
data
points
are
the
may
loss
of
two
snap
rtgs
which
landed
intact
in
the
pacific
ocean
after
a
nimbus
b
weather
satellite
failed
to
reach
orbit
the
fuel
was
recovered
after
months
with
no
release
of
plutonium
in
april
the
apollo
lunar
module
reentered
the
atmosphere
and
its
snap
rtg
heat
source
which
was
jettisoned
fell
intact
into
the
feet
deep
tonga
trench
in
the
pacific
ocean
the
corrosion
resistant
materials
of
the
rtg
are
expected
to
prevent
release
of
the
fuel
for
a
period
of
time
equal
to
halflives
of
the
fuel
or
about
years

from
the
author
of
the
quoted
study
charles
jackman
the
atmospheric

of
the
space
shuttle
effects
on
the
stratosphere
involved
three
independent
theoretical
groups
and
was

the
effort
was
to
look
at
the
effects
of
the
space
shuttle
and
titan
rockets
on
the
stratosphere
the
following
are
the
estimated
sources
of
stratospheric
chlorine
industrial
sources
kilogramsyear
natural
sources
kilogramsyear
shuttle
sources
kilogramsyear
the
shuttle
source
assumes
space
shuttles
and
titan
rockets
are
launched
yearly
thus
the
launches
would
add
less
than
to
the
total
stratospheric
chlorine
sources
the
effect
on
ozone
is
minimal
global
yearly
average
total
ozone
would
be
decreased
by
this
is
much
less
than
total
ozone
variability
associated
with
volcanic
activity
and
solar
flares
the
influence
of
humanmade
chlorine
products
on
ozone
is
computed
by
atmospheric
model
calculations
to
be
a
decrease
in
globally
averaged
ozone
between
and
the
influence
of
the
space
shuttle
and
titan
rockets
on
the
stratosphere
is
negligible
the
launch
schedule
of
the
space
shuttle
and
titan
rockets
would
need
to
be
increased
by
over
a
factor
of
a
hundred
in
order
to
have
about
the
same
effect
on
ozone
as
our
increases
in
industrial
halocarbons
do
at
the
present

theoretical
results

how
the
challenger
astronauts
died
the
challenger
shuttle
launch
was
not
destroyed
in
an
explosion
this
is
a
welldocumented
fact
see
the
rogers
commission
report
for
example
what
looked
like
an
explosion
was
fuel
burning
after
the
external
tank
came
apart
the
forces
on
the
crew
cabin
were
not
sufficient
to
kill
the
astronauts
never
mind
destroy
their
bodies
according
to
the
kerwin
teams
medicalforensic
report
the
astronauts
were
killed
when
the
moreorless
intact
cabin
hit
the
water
at
circa
and
their
bodies
then
spent
several
weeks
underwater
their
remains
were
recovered
and
after
the
kerwin
team
examined
them
they
were
sent
off
to
be
buried
using
the
shuttle
beyond
low
earth
orbit
you
cant
use
the
shuttle
orbiter
for
missions
beyond
low
earth
orbit
because
it
cant
get
there
it
is
big
and
heavy
and
does
not
carry
enough
fuel
even
if
you
fill
part
of
the
cargo
bay
with
tanks
furthermore
it
is
not
particularly
sensible
to
do
so
because
much
of
that
weight
is
things
like
wings
which
are
totally
useless
except
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
earth
the
shuttle
orbiter
is
highly
specialized
for
travel
between
earths
surface
and
low
orbit
taking
it
higher
is
enormously
costly
and
wasteful
a
much
better
approach
would
be
to
use
shuttle
subsystems
to
build
a
specialized
highorbit
spacecraft
yet
another
concise
answer
by
henry
spencer
the
face
on
mars
there
really
is
a
big
rock
on
mars
that
looks
remarkably
like
a
humanoid
face
it
appears
in
two
different
frames
of
viking
orbiter
imagery
much
more
facelike
in
appearance
and
the
one
more
often
published
with
the
sun
degrees
above
western
horizon
and
with
the
sun
degrees
from
the
west
science
writer
richard
hoagland
has
championed
the
idea
that
the
face
is
artificial
intended
to
resemble
a
human
and
erected
by
an
extraterrestrial
civilization
most
other
analysts
concede
that
the
resemblance
is
most
likely
accidental
other
viking
images
show
a
smileyfaced
crater
and
a
lava
flow
resembling
kermit
the
frog
elsewhere
on
mars
there
exists
a
mars
anomalies
research
society
sorry
dont
know
the
address
to
study
the
face
the
mars
observer
mission
will
carry
an
extremely
highresolution
camera
and
better
images
of
the
formation
will
hopefully
settle
this
question
in
a
few
years
in
the
meantime
speculation
about
the
face
is
