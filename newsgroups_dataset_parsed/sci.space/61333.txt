SUGGESTED
DISCUSSIONS
ON
LONGTERM
EFFECTS
OF
SPACEFLIGHT
TO
THE
HUMAN
BEING
I
LOVE
THIS
TOPIC
AS
SOME
OF
YOU
REGULARS
KNOW
SO
HAVING
SEEN
HENRYS
ENCOURAGING
STATEMENT
ABOUT
STARTING
TO
TALK
ABOUT
IT
I
SHALL
I
FEEL
THAT
WE
AS
A
COMMUNITY
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
UNIQUE
RESOURCES
TO
DELIVER
TO
THE
WORLD
A
COMPREHENSIVE
BOOK
WHICH
CAN
ELABORATE
ON
THE
UTILITY
OF
SPACEFLIGHT
TO
FIELDS
WHICH
ARE
AS
DIVERGENT
AS
MEDICAL
INTENSIVE
CARE
AGRICULTURE
ENVIRONMENTAL
PROTECTION
AND
PROBABLY
MORE
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
UNDERSTANDS
THE
IMPACT
OF
SPACEFLIGHT
ON
THE
WHOLE
OF
SOCIETY
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
SUCH
KNOWLEDGE
WE
SEE
DWINDLING
SUPPORT
OF
THE
WORLDS
SPACE
EFFORT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
AS
A
GROUP
HAVE
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
NOT
ONLY
COMMUNICATE
AMONGST
OURSELVES
BUT
ALSO
WITH
OTHERS
THROUGH
PRINT
MEDIA
A
WELLORCHESTRATED
AND
TECHNICALLY
ORIENTED
ANALYSIS
OF
LIFE
SCIENCE
VARIABLES
REQUIRED
TO
SUPPORT
LONGDURATION
SPACEFLIGHT
LIKE
LONG
EXPENDITIONS
TO
THE
MOON
OR
MARS
WOULD
BE
ENTERTAINING
AND
EDUCATIONAL
TO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
THE
OBJECTIVE
OF
SUCH
AN
EFFORT
WOULD
BE
TO
COMPILE
RESOURCES
AND
PUBLICATIONS
FROM
ACCEPTED
SCIENTIFIC
AND
TECHNICAL
JOURNALS
WHICH
WOULD
ADDRESS
EACH
MAJOR
LIFE
SCIENCE
AREA
IN
ADDITION
IDEAS
FOR
FURTHER
RESEARCH
AND
DEVELOPMENT
COULD
BE
PUT
FORWARD
FOR
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
TO
PONDERALLOWING
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
TO
TAKE
PART
IN
THE
EXCITEMENT
OF
EXPLORATION
INDIVIDUALS
INTERESTED
SHOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
DEVOTE
AN
HOUR
PER
WEEK
TO
RUNNING
LITERATURE
SEARCHES
AND
FINDING
JOURNAL
ARTICLES
IN
ADDITION
WE
NEED
TO
OBTAIN
THE
ASSISTANCE
OF
PERSONNEL
FROM
WITHIN
THE
HALLS
OF
NASA
AND
INDUSTRY
I
HAVE
APPRECIATED
THE
POSITIVE
RESPONSES
TO
DATE
AND
I
AM
PERSONALLY
EAGER
TO
START
THIS
PROJECT
PERHAPS
WE
COULD
START
WITH
DEBATE
REGARDING
HOW
BEST
TO
GRADE
THE
VIABILITY
OF
VARIOUS
TECHNOLOGIES
FOR
APPLICATION
TO
SPACEFLIGHT
