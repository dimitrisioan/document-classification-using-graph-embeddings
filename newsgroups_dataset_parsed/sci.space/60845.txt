WRITES
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
ANY
INFORMATION
CONCERNING
PROJECTS
INVOLVING
SOLAR
SAILS
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
JPL
DID
AN
EXTENSIVE
STUDY
ON
THE
SUBJECT
BACK
IN
THE
LATE
BUT
I
AM
HAVING
TROUBLE
GATHERING
SUCH
INFORMATION
ARE
THERE
ANY
GROUPS
OUT
THERE
CURRENTLY
INVOLVED
IN
SUCH
A
PROJECT

I
KNOW
SOMEONE
HAD
LONG
TALKS
ABOUT
SOLAR
SAILS
EARLY
THIS
YEAR
AND
LATE
LAST
YEARALSO
ABOUT
SOLAR
SAILING
NOT
SURE
WHO
CAPTURED
IT
IF
POSSIBLE
I
THINK
IT
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
REGULARS
WHO
HAD
MOST
OR
ALL
THE
DATA
I
THINK
I
STARTED
THE
LATEST
ROUND
OR
THE
LATE
LAST
YEAR
ROUND
BUT
THE
TOPIC
HAS
BEEN
AROUND
HERE
OFF
AND
ON
FOR
A
YEAR
OR
TWO
