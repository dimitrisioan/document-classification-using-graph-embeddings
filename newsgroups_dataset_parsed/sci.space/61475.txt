it
is
so
typical
that
the
rights
of
the
minority
are
extinguished
by
the
wants
of
the
majority
no
matter
how
ridiculous
those
wants
might
be
right
what
right
and
dont
you
mean
something
more
like
it
so
typical
that
the
wants
of
the
minority
can
obstruct
the
wants
of
the
majority
no
matter
how
ridiculous
those
minority
wants
might
be
or
what
benefits
those
majority
wants
might
have
my
sole
connection
with
the
project
is
that
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
classes
at
the
university
of
colorado
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
