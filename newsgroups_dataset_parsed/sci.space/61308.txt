RE
WHAT
COUNNTRIES
DO
SPACE
SURVEILLANCE
THE
EUROPEAN
SPACE
AGENCY
HAS
INVOLVEMENT
WITH
REMOTE
EARTH
OBSERVATION
AND
I
PRESUME
THIS
INCLUDES
SURVEILLANCE
OPTICAL
ETC
SO
ITS
NOT
JUST
THE
USUSSREX
WHO
ARE
IN
THE
GAME
BUT
WHAT
IS
THE
GAME
WHAT
CAN
BE
DONE
WITH
SPACE
OBSERVATION
THE
MILITARY
FUNCTIONS
OF
MISSILE
SPOTTING
TROOP
SPOTTING
ETC
ARE
WELL
DOCUMENTED
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
ANYTHING
ELSE
THE
BIGGEST
EG
I
CAN
THINK
OF
IS
TO
GET
A
METAL
SENSING
SAT
OVER
A
PAYING
COUNTRY
AND
SCAN
THEIR
TERRITORY
FOR
PRECIOUS
METALS
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
IF
RADAR
CAN
SPOT
WATER
VAPOUR
CLOUDS
PRESUMABLY
A
RADAR
BASED
SAT
WILL
BE
CAPABLE
OF
SPOTTING
RIVERSOPEN
WATER
AND
UNDERGROUND
WATER
FROM
SPACE
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
POSITIVE
LIFE
SAVER
FOR
AFRICAN
OR
OTHER
DROUGHT
AFFECTED
COUNTRIES
IMPLEMENTING
A
CLEAN
WATER
AND
IRRIGATION
PROGRAM
WOULD
BE
OF
IMENSE
BENIFIT
TO
SUCH
COUNTRIES
AND
SHOULD
CUT
DOWN
MORTALITIES
CONSIDERABLY
SO
HOW
ABOUT
IT
IS
THERE
A
CHARITY
OR
GOVERNMENT
AGENCY
THAT
WOULD
PAY
FOR
A
THIRD
WORLD
COUNTRY
TO
HAVE
THEIR
MINERALS
AND
WATER
DEPOSITS
MAPPED
OR
IS
THIS
STILL
SCIFI
MAIL
REPLIES
WOULD
BE
GREAT
THOUGHT
FOR
THE
DAY
THERMAL
ENERGY
NEEDS
WATER
TO
MAKE
STEAM
SO
SSTICK
IT
IN
THE
OCEAN
MARVIN
BATTY
DJFUKACCOVCCK
AND
THEY
SHALL
NOT
FIND
THOSE
THINGS
WITH
A
SORT
OF
RAFIA
LIKE
BASE
THAT
THEIR
FATHERS
PUT
THERE
JUST
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE
AT
ABOUT
OCLOCK
