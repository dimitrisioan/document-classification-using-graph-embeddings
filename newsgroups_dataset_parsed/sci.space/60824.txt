ORION
DRIVE
IN
VACUUM
HOW
BACKGROUND
THE
ORION
SPACEDRIVE
WAS
A
THEORETICAL
CONCEPT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
DRIVE
USING
THERMONUCLEAR
EXPLOSIONS
TO
DRIVE
A
SPACECRAFT
THE
IDEA
WAS
THAT
YOUD
DETONATE
DEVICES
WITH
SOMEWHERE
FROM
ONE
TO
TEN
MEGATONS
YIELD
BEHIND
A
PUSHER
PLATE
ATTACHED
TO
THE
MAIN
SPACECRAFT
THE
SHOCK
WAVE
FROM
THE
EXPLOSIONS
WOULD
TRANSFER
MOMENTUM
TO
THE
SHIP
NOW
IN
AN
ATMOSPHERE
I
CAN
SEE
THIS
THE
ENERGY
OF
THE
EXPLOSION
HEATS
THE
ATMOSPHERE
WHICH
EXPANDS
EXPLOSIVELY
AND
SLAMS
A
SHOCK
WAVE
INTO
THE
PUSHER
PLATE
BUT
IN
A
VACUUM
ONLY
TWO
THINGS
I
CAN
SEE
ARE
GOING
TO
HIT
THE
PLATE
FISSIONFUSION
PRODUCTS
BARIUM
KRYPTON
HELIUM
NEUTRONS
EVAPORATED
BOMB
CASING
AND
ELECTROMAGNETIC
RADIATION
GAMMAS
MOSTLY
SOME
LIGHTHEAT
FROM
IRRADIATED
FISSION
PRODUCTS
WOULD
THIS
WORK
I
CANT
SEE
THE
EM
RADIATION
IMPELLING
VERY
MUCH
MOMENTUM
ESPECIALLY
GIVEN
THE
MASS
OF
THE
PUSHER
PLATE
AND
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
YOURE
GOING
TO
GET
MORE
MOMENTUM
TRANSFER
THROWING
THE
BOMBS
OUT
THE
BACK
OF
THE
SHIP
THAN
YOU
GET
FROM
DETONATING
THEM
ONCE
THEYRE
THERE
I
MUST
BE
MISSING
SOMETHING
WOULD
SOMEONE
ENLIGHTEN
ME

EMAIL
