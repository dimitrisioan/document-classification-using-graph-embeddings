JIM
COBBAN
WRITES
HAVING
READ
IN
THE
PAST
ABOUT
THE
FAILSAFE
MECHANISMS
ON
SPACECRAFT
I
HAD
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
COMMAND
LOSS
TIMER
HAD
THAT
SORT
OF
FUNCTION
HOWEVER
I
ALWAYS
FIND
DISTURBING
THE
OXYMORON
OF
A
NOOP
COMMAND
THAT
DOES
SOMETHING
IF
THE
COMMAND
CHANGES
THE
BEHAVIOR
OR
STATUS
OF
THE
SPACECRAFT
IT
IS
NOT
A
NOOP
COMMAND
OF
COURSE
THIS
TERMINOLOGY
COMES
FROM
A
JET
PROPULSION
LABORATORY
WHICH
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
JET
PROPULSION
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
YOU
GOT
THIS
IDEA
FROM
JPLS
HISTORY
DATES
BACK
TO
TO
THE
WHEN
A
CALTECH
PROFESSOR
NAMED
VON
KARMAN
CONDUCTED
EXPERIMENTS
IN
ROCKET
PROPULSION
WITH
A
GROUP
OF
GRADUATE
STUDENTS
ON
THE
PRESENT
SITE
OF
THE
JET
PROPULSION
LABORATORY
THE
ARMY
STARTED
FUNDING
THE
LABORATORY
AND
HAD
JURISDICTION
UNTILL
THE
LATE
WHEN
NASA
TOOK
OVER
THE
EARLY
RESEARCH
CONDUCTED
AT
THE
LABORATORY
LED
TO
MANY
APPLICATIONS
THE
FIRST
BEING
JETASSISTED
TAKEOFF
ROCKETS
FOR
AIRCRAFT
I
THINK
THIS
SHOULD
EXPLAIN
WHERE
JPL
GOT
ITS
NAME
I
SHOULD
KNOW
I
WORKED
THERE
FOR
FIVE
WONDERFUL
YEARS
