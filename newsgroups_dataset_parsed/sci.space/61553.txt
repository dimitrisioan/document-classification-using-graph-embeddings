ITS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
SOME
OF
OUR
BEST
TOOLS
FOR
COST
CONTROL
AVAILABLE
IN
INDUSTRY
TODAY
WERE
DERIVED
FROM
GOVERNMENT
PROJECTS
GANTT
CHARTS
CPM
AND
MOST
OF
THE
MODERN
SCHEDULING
SOFTWARE
COMES
FROM
DOD
PROJECTS
AND
THEIR
CONTRACTORS
THE
CONSTRUCTION
INDUSTRY
OF
COURSE
HOW
MANY
GOVERNMENT
PROJECTS
AFTER
USING
PERT
GANT
CPMS
PROCESS
FLOW
DIAGRAMS
LEVEL
SOFTWARE
PROJECTS
ACTUALLY
COME
IN
ON
SCHEDULE
AND
UNDER
COST
I
KNOW
THE
GAO
DETERMINED
THAT
OF
ALL
NASA
PROJECTS
MISS
THEIR
BUDGETS
DUE
TO
FAILING
TO
ADEQUATELY
MEASURE
ENGINEERING
DEVELOPEMENT
COSTS
ME
I
AM
ALLIN
FAVOR
OF
GOVERNMENT
RD
I
THOUGHT
BELL
LABS
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
TO
DO
RESEARCH
I
DONT
THINK
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
POUR
MONEY
INTO
ANY
ONE
SECTOR
BUT
SHOULD
ENGAGE
IN
PROJECTS
WHICH
NATURALLY
PUSH
THE
STATE
OF
THE
ART
THINGS
LIKE
HIGH
TECH
CONSTRUCTION
PROJECTS
APOLLO
WAS
WORTH
IT
FOR
THE
DOING
RUNNING
HTE
NATIONAL
LABS
THE
SSC
IS
GROSSLY
OVERWEIGHT
BUT
IS
A
REASONABLE
PROJECT
AT
A
LOWER
COST
UNFORTUNATELY
SUPPORT
FOR
SOLO
INVESTIGATORS
IS
DIRELY
NEGLECTED
MAYBE
WHAT
THEY
SHOULD
DO
IS
THROW
OUT
MUCH
OF
THE
PROCESS
AND
JUST
TELL
NEW
PHDS
YOU
GET
A
TIME
GRANT
OF
IF
YOU
PRODUCE
YOU
CAN
QUALIFY
FOR
OTHER
GRANTS
IF
YOU
DONT
YOU
NEVER
GET
IN
AGAIN
THIS
WAY
YOUNG
PEOPLE
GET
A
SHOT
AT
RESERACH
AND
OLDER
STALE
SCIENTISTS
DONT
DOMINATE
THE
PROCESS
