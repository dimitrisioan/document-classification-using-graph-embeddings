HENRY
SPENCER
WRITES
IN
RESPONSE
TO
MICHAEL
ADAMS
POST
I
VOTE
FOR
A
LATER
ON
SCISPACEMEDICINE
OR
SIMILAR
NEWSGROUP
FRO
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
LONG
TERM
MISSIONS
INTO
SPACE
AND
THERE
AFFECTS
ON
HUMANS
AND
SUCH
ADAMS
WHY
BOTHER
WITH
A
NEW
NEWSGROUP
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
DISCUSS
THE
SUBJECT
START
DISCUSSING
IT
IF
THERE
IS
ENOUGH
TRAFFIC
TO
ANNOY
THE
REST
OF
US
WE
WILL
LET
YOU
KNOW
AND
THEN
IT
WILL
BE
TIME
FOR
A
NEW
NEWSGROUP
WELL
HERE
GOES
THE
FIRST
ITEM
OF
BUSINESS
IS
TO
ESTABLISH
THE
IMPORTANCE
SPACE
LIFE
SCIENCES
IN
THE
WHOLE
OF
SCHEME
OF
HUMANKIND
I
MEAN
COMPARED
TO
FOOTBALL
AND
BASEBALL
THE
AVERAGE
JOE
SCHMOE
DOESNT
SEEM
INTERESTED
OR
EVEN
CURIOUS
ABOUT
SPACEFLIGHT
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
FORUM
CAN
MAKE
A
MAJOR
CHANGE
IN
THAT
LACK
OF
INSIGHT
AND
EDUCATION
ALL
OF
US
IN
OUR
OWN
WAY
CAN
CONTRIBUTE
TO
A
COMPREHENSIVE
DOCUMENT
WHICH
CAN
BE
RELEASED
TO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
AROUND
THE
WORLD
THE
DOCUMENT
WOULD
SCIENTIFICALLY
ANALYZE
THE
TECHNICAL
ASPECTS
OF
LONG
TERM
HUMAN
HABITATION
IN
SPACE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
ANY
LONGTERM
SPACE
EXPLORATION
PROGRAM
IS
TO
SUCCEED
WE
NEED
TO
BASICALLY
LEARN
HOW
TO
ENGINEER
OUR
OWN
MICROWORLD
IE
THE
SPACECRAFT
ONLY
THROUGH
THE
CAREFUL
ANALYSES
OF
ENGINEERING
CHEMICAL
BIOLOGICAL
AND
MEDICAL
FACTORS
WILL
A
GOOD
ECOSYSTEM
BE
CREATED
TO
FACILITATE
HUMAN
LIFE
ON
A
LONGDURATION
FLIGHT
SO
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
POSTS
OF
OPINIONS
REGARDING
THE
MOST
OBJECTIVE
METHODS
TO
ANALYZE
THE
ACCEPTED
SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE
FOR
TECHNOLOGIES
WHICH
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
LONGDURATION
SPACEFLIGHT
SUCH
A
DETAILED
LITERATURE
SEARCH
WOULD
BE
OF
INTEREST
TO
OURSELVES
AS
SPACE
ADVOCATES
AND
CLEARLY
IMPORTANT
TO
EXISTING
SPACE
PROGRAMS
IN
ESSENCE
WE
WOULD
BE
DIVIDING
THE
SPACE
LIFE
SCIENCE
ISSUES
INTO
VARIOUS
TECHNICAL
PROBLEMS
WHICH
COULD
BE
SOLVED
WITH
VARIOUS
TECHNOLOGIES
THIS
DATABASE
OF
ACCEPTABLE
SOLUTIONS
TO
VARIOUS
PROBLEMS
COULD
FORM
THE
BASIS
OF
DETAILED
DISCUSSIONS
INVOLVING
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
BIONET
ISUNET
AND
ANY
OTHER
SOURCE
IM
EAGER
TO
HEAR
YOUR
COMMENTS
AND
SEE
POSTS
ON
THIS
THREAD
