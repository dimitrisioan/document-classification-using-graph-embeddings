HENRY
SPENCER
WRITES
THIS
PRIZE
ISNT
BIG
ENOUGH
TO
WARRENT
DEVELOPING
A
SSTO
BUT
IT
IS
ENOUGH
TO
DO
IT
IF
THE
VEHICLE
EXISTS
ACTUALLY
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
WILL
TELL
YOU
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
ENOUGH
TO
DO
SSTO
DEVELOPMENT
IF
DONE
PRIVATELY
AS
A
CUTRATE
OPERATION
OF
COURSE
THEY
MAY
BE
OVEROPTIMISTIC
IN
SPITE
OF
MY
GREAT
RESPECT
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
YOU
SPEAK
OF
I
THINK
THEIR
COST
ESTIMATES
ARE
A
BIT
OVEROPTIMISTIC
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
A
WORKING
SSTO
IS
AT
LEAST
AS
COMPLEX
AS
A
LARGE
AIRLINER
AND
HAS
A
SMALLER
EXPERIENCE
BASE
IT
THEREFORE
SEEMS
THAT
SSTO
DEVELOPMENT
SHOULD
COST
AT
LEAST
AS
MUCH
AS
A
TYPICAL
AIRLINER
DEVELOPMENT
THAT
PUTS
IT
IN
THE
TO
RANGE
YOU
CAN
ALSO
ASSUME
THAT
A
WORKING
SSTO
WOULD
HAVE
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
THAT
WOULD
HELP
PAY
FOR
ITS
DEVELOPMENT
COSTS
TRUE
IT
AND
THE
CONTEST
WOULD
RESULT
IN
A
MUCH
LARGER
MARKET
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
ENOUGH
TO
ATTRACT
THE
INVESTORS
GIVEN
THE
RISKS
INVOLVED
IF
YOU
COULD
GURANTEE
THE
SSTO
COSTS
AND
GURANTEE
THAT
IT
CAPTURES
OF
THE
AVAILABLE
LAUNCH
MARKET
THEN
I
THINK
YOU
COULD
DO
IT
ALLEN
LADY
ASTOR
SIR
IF
YOU
WERE
MY
HUSBAND
I
WOULD
POISON
YOUR
COFFEE
W
CHURCHILL
MADAM
IF
YOU
WERE
MY
WIFE
I
WOULD
DRINK
IT
DAYS
TO
FIRST
FLIGHT
