announce
that
a
reward
of
billion
would
go
to
the
first
corporation
who
successfully
keeps
at
least
person
alive
on
the
moon
for
a
year
then
youd
see
some
of
the
inexpensive
but
not
popular
technologies
begin
to
be
developed
thered
be
a
different
kind
of
space
race
then
im
an
advocate
of
this
idea
for
funding
space
station
work
and
i
throw
around
the
billion
figure
for
that
reward
i
suggest
that
you
increase
the
lunar
reward
to
about
billion
this
would
encourage
private
industry
to
invest
in
space
which
should
be
one
of
nasas
primary
goals
