RE
VANDALIZING
THE
SKY
IM
WONDERING
IF
VANDALIZE
IS
THE
PROPER
WORD
TO
USE
IN
THIS
SITUATION
MY
DICTIONARY
DEFINES
VANDALISM
AS
THE
WILLFUL
OR
MALICIOUS
DESTRUCTUION
OF
PUBLIC
OR
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
ESPECIALLY
OF
ANYTHING
BEAUTIFUL
OR
ARTISITC
I
WOULD
AGREE
THE
SKY
IS
BEAUTIFUL
BUT
NOT
THAT
IT
IS
PUBLIC
OR
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
I
PERSONALLY
PREFER
NATURAL
SKIES
FAR
FROM
CITY
LIGHTS
AND
SANS
AIRCRAFT
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
ALSO
SOMETHING
TO
BE
SAID
FOR
BEING
ABLE
TO
LOOK
UP
INTO
THE
SKY
AND
SEE
A
SATELLITE
MANY
PEOPLE
GET
A
REAL
KICK
OUT
OF
IT
ESPECIALLY
IF
THEY
HAVENT
SEEN
ONE
BEFORE
JOSH
HOPKINS
FIND
A
WAY
OR
MAKE
ONE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
HANNIBAL
