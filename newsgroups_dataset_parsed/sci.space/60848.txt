RE
ORBITAL
REPAIRSTATION
THE
DIFFICULTIES
OF
A
HIGH
ISP
OTV
INCLUDE
LONG
TRANSFER
TIMES
RADIATION
DAMAGE
FROM
VANALLEN
BELTS
FOR
BOTH
THE
SPACECRAFT
AND
OTV
ARCJETS
OR
XENON
THRUSTERS
REQUIRE
HUGE
AMOUNTS
OF
POWER
SO
YOU
HAVE
TO
HAVE
EITHER
NUCLEAR
POWER
SOURCE
MESSY
DANGEROUS
AND
SOURCE
OF
RADIATION
DAMAGE
OR
BIG
SOLAR
ARRAYS
SENSITIVE
TO
RADIATION
OR
HEAVY
THAT
MAKE
ATTITUDE
CONTROL
AND
DOCKING
A
BIG
PAIN
IF
YOU
GO
SOLAR
YOU
HAVE
TO
REPLACE
THE
ARRAYS
EVERY
TRIP
WITH
CURRENT
TECHNOLOGY
NUCLEAR
POWER
SOURCES
ARE
STRONGLY
RESTRICTED
BY
INTERNATIONAL
TREATY
REFUELING
EVEN
FOR
VERY
HIGH
ISP
LIKE
XENON
IS
STILL
REQUIRED
AND
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
A
PAIN
YOU
EITHER
HAVE
TO
DEVELOP
AUTONOMOUS
RENDEZVOUS
OR
LONG
RANGE
TELEOPERATION
TO
DO
DOCKING
OR
AND
REFUELING
YOU
STILL
CANT
DO
MUCH
PLANE
CHANGE
BECAUSE
THE
DELTAV
REQUIRED
IS
SO
HIGH
THE
AIR
FORCE
CONTINUES
TO
LOOK
AT
DOING
THINGS
THIS
WAY
THOUGH
I
SUPPOSE
THEY
ARE
BIDING
THEIR
TIME
TILL
THE
TECHNOLOGY
BECOMES
AVAILABLE
AND
THE
PROBLEMS
GET
SOLVED
NOT
IMPOSSIBLE
IN
PRINCIPLE
BUT
HARD
TO
DO
AND
MARGINALLY
CHEAPER
THAN
ONE
SHOT
ROCKETS
AT
LEAST
TODAY
JUST
A
FEW
RANDOM
THOUGHTS
ON
HIGH
ISP
OTVS
