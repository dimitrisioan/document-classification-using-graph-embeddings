GARY
COFFMAN
SAYS
ITS
CONCEIVABLE
THAT
LUNA
WILL
HAVE
A
MILITARY
PURPOSE
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
LUNA
WILL
HAVE
A
COMMERCIAL
PURPOSE
BUT
ITS
MOST
LIKELY
THAT
LUNA
WILL
ONLY
HAVE
A
SCIENTIFIC
PURPOSE
FOR
THE
NEXT
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
YEARS
AT
LEAST
THEREFORE
LUNAR
BASES
SHOULD
BE
PREDICATED
ON
FUNDING
LEVELS
LITTLE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THOSE
FOUND
FOR
ANTARCTIC
BASES
CAN
YOU
PUT
A
PERSON
BASE
ON
THE
MOON
FOR
MILLION
A
YEAR
EVEN
IF
YOU
USE
GRAD
STUDENTS
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
ONE
FOR
THAT
PUT
IT
THERE
HARDLY
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
AT

A
COUPLE
CENTURIES
BEFORE
THERE
WILL
BE
SIGNIFICANT
COMMERICAL
ACTIVITY
ON
THE
MOON
WISHFUL
THINKING
MOSTLY
ITS
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
THE
MOON
WILL
NEVER
BE
THE
SITE
OF
MAJOR
COMMERCIAL
ACTIVITY
AS
FAR
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
HAS
NO
MATERIALS
WE
CANT
GET
CHEAPER
RIGHT
HERE
ON
EARTH
OR
FROM
ASTEROIDS
AND
COMETS
ASIDE
FROM
THE
SEMIMYTHIC
THAT
MIGHT
BE
USEFUL
IN
LOW
GRADE
FUSION
REACTORS
EXPLORING
IT
WOULD
SATISFY
A
CURIOSITY
ITCH
AND
ITS
POSITION
IN
THE
GRAVITY
WELL
OF
EARTH
COUPLED
WITH
ITS
HEAT
SINK
CAPACITY
COULD
OFFER
SOME
MILITARY
UTILITY
FOR
HIGH
GROUND
MILITARY
WEAPONS
SYSTEMS
BUT
IT
HOLDS
VERY
MINUTE
COMMERCIAL
VALUE
IF
SPACE
TRAVEL
BECOMES
CHEAP
ENOUGH
IT
MIGHT
BECOME
A
TOURIST
ATTRACTION
AS
MT
EVEREST
AND
THE
ANTARCTIC
HAVE
BECOME
BUT
THATS
A
VERY
MINOR
ACTIVITY
IN
THE
GLOBAL
SCOPE
OF
THINGS
LUNA
HAS
AN
INCONVIENENT
GRAVITY
FIELD
ITS
LIKELY
TOO
LOW
TO
PREVENT
CALCIUM
LOSS
MUSCLE
ATROPHY
AND
LONG

GENETIC
DRIFT
YET
ITS
TOO
HIGH
TO
DO
MICROG

AND
FACTORIES
THAT
CAN
BE

OF

LOOK
MUCH
BETTER
LUNA
HAS
A
MODEST
VACUUM
AND
RAW
SOLAR
EXPOSURE
TWO
WEEKS
A
MONTH
BUT
ORBITAL
SITES
CAN
HAVE
BETTER
VACUUMS
AND
CONTINOUS
SOLAR
EXPOSURE
LUNA
OFFERS
A
SOURCE
OF
LIGHT
ELEMENT
ROCKS
THAT
CAN
SERVE
AS
RAW

HEATSINK
AND
SHIELDING
THE
ASTEROIDS
AND
COMETS
OFFER
SOURCES
OF
BOTH
LIGHT

HEAVY
ELEMENTS
AND
VOLATILE
COMPOUNDS
AND
MANY
ARE
IN
LESS
STEEP
GRAVITY
WELLS
SO
THAT
LESS
DELTAV
IS
REQUIRED
TO
REACH
THEM
WE
DONT
USE
OF
THE
EARTH
NOW
THE
SEAFLOORS
AND
WE
VIRTUALLY
IGNORE
ANTARCTICA
A
WHOLE
CONTINENT
THATS
BECAUSE
WE
DONT
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
THOSE
CONDITIONS
IN

TO
MAKE
A
BUCK
LUNA
IS
A
MUCH
MORE
EXPENSIVE
PLACE
TO
VISIT
OR
TO
LIVE

WORK
I
THINK
WELL
USE
THE
EASIER

THAT

A
FEW

NOT
MUCH
LONGER

WEAPONS
SYSTEM
FOR

OR

IT
AS
THE
CASE
MAY
BE
THE
FIRST
IS
UNLIKELY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
HIGH
COST
FOR
SUCH
A
BASIC
SCIENCE
INSTRUMENT
THE
SECOND
IS
JUST
AS
UNLIKELY
BECAUSE
CONVENTIONAL
NUKES
ARE
GOOD
ENOUGH
AND
THE
MILITARY
WOULD
REALLY
RATHER
SEE
THE

SAFE
FOR
