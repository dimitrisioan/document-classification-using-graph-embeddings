AS

PROVIDED

WITH

ON

GRAINS
FOR

SOLID
MOTOR
PROPELLANTS
USUALLY
HAVE
A
SUBSTANTIAL
PERCENTAGE
OF
ALUMINUM
IN
THE
MIX
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
SPACE
SHUTTLE
SRBS
ARE
PERCENT
ALUMINUM
THE
TECHNIQUE
IS
TO
USE
A
FOAMED
ALUMINUM
STRUCTURE
THE
STRUCTURE
LOOKS
LIKE
THE
INVERSE
OF
A

AN

SUSPECT
SOME

IT
IN

IF
YOU
MADE
A

IN

ALUMINUM
THEN
FROZE
IT
THIS
IS
WHAT
YOU
GET
IT
FORMS
A

THE

THE

MAKES
UP
ABOUT

SO
THERE

THE
