i
would
appreciate
any
thoughts
on
what
makes
a
planet
habitable
for
humans
i
am
making
asumptions
that
life
and
a
similar
atmosphere
evolve
given
a
range
of
physical
aspects
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physical
aspects
simply
disallow
earth
like
conditions
eg
temperature
range
of
to
where
temp
is
purely
dependant
on
dist
from
the
sun
and
the
suns
temperature
atmospheric
presure
i
know
nothing
of
human
tolerance
planetary
mass
again
gravity
at
surface
is
important
how
much
can
human
bodies
take
day
after
day
also
how
does
the
mass
effect
atmosphere
i
thinking
of
planets
between
and
times
mass
of
the
earth
i
suppose
density
should
be
important
as
well
climate
etc
does
not
concern
me
nor
does
axial
tilt
etc
etc
just
the
above
three
factors
and
how
they
relate
to
one
another
dandridge
cole
and
isaac
asimov
collaborated
on
a
book
titled
habitable
planets
for
man
i
think
in
it
should
be
available
in
most
good
libraries
or
through
interlibrary
loan
it
answered
the
questions
you
ask
speculatively
of
course
along
with
many
more
that
need
to
be
considered
in
habitability
studies
length
of
day
for
daynight
temperature
variation
and
agricultural
concerns
partial
pressures
of
certain
unexpected
gasses
ever
hear
of
xenon
narcosis
neither
did
i
density
of
particulates
in
the
atm
and
their
composition
ever
hear
of
silicosis
not
much
fun
etc
climate
isnt
a
global
phenomenon
and
probably
neednt
concern
you
but
axial
tilt
ought
to
it
plays
a
large
part
in
determining
the
severity
of
seasonal
differences
and
a
lesser
but
still
significant
part
in
determining
the
speed
of
prevailing
winds
