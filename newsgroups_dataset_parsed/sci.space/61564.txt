said
no
a
dragless
satellite
does
not
magically
have
no
drag
it
burns
fuel
constantly
to
fight
drag
maintaining
the
exact
orbit
it
would
have
if
there
was
no
drag
well
almost
it
turns
out
that
clever
orbital
mechanics
can
engineer
things
so
that
resonant
interactions
with
the
higher
order
harmonics
of
the
earths
gravitational
field
can
pump
energy
into
a
satellite
and
keep
it
from
experiencing
drag
effects
for
periods
of
months
to
years
my
favorite
example
of
this
is
the
sovietrussian
heavy
elint
satellites
of
the
cosmos
class
which
are
in
resonance
in
particular
has
undergone
two
periods
of
prolonged
gain
in
altitude
the
current
one
having
started
in
june
the
mean
altitude
of
the
satellite
is
now
as
high
as
it
has
ever
been
since
launch
on
march
looking
at
the
elements
for
also
shows
the
limitations
of
norads
software
but
thats
another
story
this
probably
has
little
relevance
to
space
stations
since
the
degree
orbits
of
the
satellites
are
at
km
which
is
unacceptably
far
into
the
inner
van
allen
belt
for
manned
platforms
but
its
kind
of
interesting
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
physics
of
the
situation
orbital
elements
for
these
satellites
are
available
on
request

is
there
an
opinion

if
so
