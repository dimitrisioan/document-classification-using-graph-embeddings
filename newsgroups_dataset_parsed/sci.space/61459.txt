GREG
MOORE
WRITES
AS
HERNY
POINTED
OUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
DEVELOP
THE
THRUSTER
ALSO
WHILE
MUCH
LIGHTER
YOU
STILL
HAVE
TO
LIFT
THE
MASS
OF
THE
THRUSTER
TO
ORBIT
AND
THEN
THE
THRUSTER
LIFTS
ITS
OWN
WEIGHT
INTO
A
HIGHER
ORBIT
AND
YOU
TAKE
UP
ROOM
IN
THE
PAYLOAD
BAY
A
YES
BUT
THE
IMPROVEMENT
IN
BOOST
ORBIT
TO
THE
HST
IS
SIGNIFICANT
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
HERE
WHAT
IS
IMPROVED
WHAT
IS
SIGNIFICANT
AND
WHAT
DOES
THIS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
CARRYING
MORE
EQUIPMENT
ON
A
SERVICING
MISSION
ALSO
AS
IMPLIED
BY
OTHER
POSTERS
WHY
DO
YOU
NEED
TO
BOOST
THE
ORBIT
ON
THIS
MISSION
ANYWAY
MAYBE
YOU
HAVE
SOMETHING
HERE
BUT
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
CLARIFY
IT
FOR
US
ON
THE
NET
RIGHT
NOW
THE
HST
SEVICING
MISSION
IS
LISTED
AS
DAYS
BEFORE
IT
WAS
LISTED
AS
DAYS
THEY
JUST
KICKED
UP
THE
NUMBER
OF
SPACEWALKS
TO
AFTER
SIMULATIONS
INDICATED
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
DOABLE
IN
AFTER
ALL
THE
SPACE
WALKING
THEY
ARE
GOING
TO
REBOOST
THE
HSTS
ORBIT
I
THINK
RIGHT
NOW
ITS
SITTING
AT
MILES
UP
THEY
WOULD
LIKE
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
EXACT
ORBIT
NUMBERS
I
KNOW
WHEN
HST
WAS
FIRST
FLOWN
IT
WAS
PLACED
IN
THE
HIGHEST
POSSIBLE
SHUTTLE
ORBIT
NOW
THE
SHUTTLE
CAN
CARY
A
THING
CALLED
THE
EDO
PALLET
OR
EXTENDED
DURATION
ORBITER
PALLET
ITS
MOSTLY
LOXLH
FOR
THE
FUEL
CELLS
AND
RCS
GEAR
PLUS
MORE
AND
CANISTERS
FOR
THE
LIFE
SUPPORT
REBREATHERS
MAYBE
MORE
NITROGEN
TOO
THE
LIMIT
ON
SPACEWALKING
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
SUIT
SUPPLIES
MASS
AND
ORBITER
DURATION
IN
ORDER
TO
PERFORM
THE
REBOOST
OF
THE
HST
THE
OMS
ENGINES
WILL
BE
FIRED
FOR
A
LONG
PERIOD
NOW
THE
SHUTTLE
IS
A
HEAVY
THING
THE
HST
ISNT
LIGHT
EITHER
THE
AMOUNT
OF
OMS
FUEL
NEEDED
TO
FLY
BOTH
UP
IS
SUBSTANTIAL
A
SMALL
BOOSTER
CARRIED
UP
AND
USED
TO
BOOST
HST
ON
ITS
OWN
WILL
WEIGH
SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS
THEN
THE
OMS
FUEL
REQUIRED
TO
BOOST
BOTH
HST
AND
SHUTTLE
FOR
A
GIVEN
ORBITAL
CHANGE
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
MASS
MARGINS
ON
THE
HST
MISSIONS
ARE
TIGHT
ENOUGH
THEY
CANT
EVEN
CARRY
EXTRA
SUITS
OR
MMUS
NOW
IF
THEY
USED
A
SMALL
TUG
I
WOULD
BET
JUST
A
WILD
GUESS
THAT
THE
SAVINGS
ON
AMSS
MARGIN
WOULD
ALLOW
CARRYING
THE
EDO
PALLET
EXTRA
SUITS
MORE
CONSUMABLES
PARTS
FOR
THE
FLAKY
FGS
SENSOR
PARTS
FOR
THE
BALKY
SOLAR
ELECTRONICS
AND
STILL
ENOUGH
FOR
A
DOUBLE
MAGNUM
OF
CHAMPAGNE
OR
THE
HST
COULD
EVEN
GET
PLACED
INTO
SOME
SORT
OF
MEDIUM
ORBIT
THE
REASON
THEY
WANT
A
HIGH
ORBIT
IS
LESS
ANTENNA
POINTING
AND
LONGER
DRAG
LIFE
AND
THAT
MEANS
YOU
CAN
THEN
CARRY
EDO
PACKS
AND
ENOUGH
CONSUMABLES
SO
THE
SHUTTLE
MISSION
CAN
GO
ON
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
ALSO
FIX
THE
ARRAY
TILT
MOTORS
AND
GOD
KNOWS
WHAT
ELSE
IS
GOING
TO
WEAR
OUT
FROM
WHAT
IVE
HEARD
THE
MOTORS
ARE
FINE
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
SETS
OF
ELECTRONICS
THAT
CONTROL
THE
MOTORS
THAT
NEEDS
A
FIX
THE
MOTORS
AND
ELECTRONICS
ARE
SEPARATE
PIECES
OF
HARDWARE
I
EXPECT
TO
BE
CORRECTED
IF
IM
WRONG
ON
THIS
A
WHATEVER
IT
IS
THE
PROBLEM
IN
THE
TILT
ARRAY
IS
A
BIG
CONSTRAINT
ON
HST
OPS
PAT
