I
LOVE
THE
IDEA
OF
AN
INFLATABLE
LONG
SIGN
IT
WILL
BE
A
REALLY
NEAT
THING
TO
SEE
IT
EXPLODE
WHEN
A
BOLT
OR
EVEN
BETTER
A
WESTFORD
NEEDLE
COMES
CRASHING
INTO
IT
AT
CLICKS
A
SEC
PAGEOS
AND
TWO
ECHO
BALLOONS
WERE
INFLATED
WITH
A
SUBSTANCE
WHICH
EXPANDED
IN
VACUUM
ONCE
INFLATED
THE
SUBSTANCE
WAS
NO
LONGER
NEEDED
SINCE
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
CAUSE
THE
BALLOON
TO
COLLAPSE
THIS
INFLATABLE
STRUCTURE
COULD
SUFFER
MULTIPLE
HOLES
WITH
NO
DISASTROUS
DEFLATION
