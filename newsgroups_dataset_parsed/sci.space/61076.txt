depends
if
you
assume
the
existance
of
a
working
ssto
like
dc
on
billion
would
be
enough
to
put
about
a
quarter
million
pounds
of
stuff
on
the
moon
if
some
of
that
mass
went
to
send
equipment
to
make
lox
for
the
transfer
vehicle
you
could
send
a
lot
more
either
way
its
a
lot
more
than
needed
this
prize
isnt
big
enough
to
warrent
developing
a
ssto
but
it
is
enough
to
do
it
if
the
vehicle
exists
but
allen
if
you
can
assume
the
existence
of
an
ssto
there
is
no
need
to
have
the
contest
in
the
first
place
i
would
think
that
what
we
want
to
get
out
of
the
contest
is
the
development
of
some
of
these
cheaper
ways
of
doing
things
if
they
already
exist
why
flush
just
to
get
someone
to
go
to
the
moon
for
a
year
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
