a
short
story
in
the
newspaper
a
few
days
ago
made
some
sort
of
mention
about
how
the
japanese
using
what
sounded
like
a
gravity
assist
had
just
managed
to
crash
or
crashland
a
package
on
the
moon
their
hiten
engineeringtest
mission
spent
a
while
in
a
highly
eccentric
earth
orbit
doing
lunar
flybys
and
then
was
inserted
into
lunar
orbit
using
some
very
tricky
gravityassistlike
maneuvering
this
meant
that
it
would
crash
on
the
moon
eventually
since
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
stable
lunar
orbit
as
far
as
anyone
knows
and
i
believe
i
recall
hearing
recently
that
it
was
about
to
happen
all
work
is
one
