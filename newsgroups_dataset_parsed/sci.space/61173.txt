THREE
TALKS
IN
THE
LAST

WHICH
MIGHT
BE
OF
INTEREST
IVE
TRANSCRIBED
SOME
OF
MY
NOTES

SINCE
MY

BY
NO

THIS
WITHOUT

MICHAEL
STERNBERG
CHEIF
OF
OPERATIONS
OF
RIMSAT
WAS
INVITED
TO
SPEAK
AT
AN
INFORMAL
LUNCH
HELD
BY
ACDIS
HERE
ON
THE
CAMPUS
OF
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
ILLINOIS
ACDIS
IS
AN
ORGANIZATION
ON
CAMPUS
THAT
DEALS
WITH
ARMS
CONTROL
DISARMAMENT
AND
INTERNATIONAL
SECURITY
RIMSAT
WAS
CONSIDERED
AN
APPROPRIATE
TOPIC
BECAUSE
THE
COMPANY
IS
USING
RUSSIAN
LAUNCHERS
AND
SATELLITES
I
THINK
IT
ALSO
HELPED
THAT
HIS
DAUGHTER
IS
A
GRAD
STUDENT
IN
THE
INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS
PROGRAM
THE
CONCEPT
BEHIND
RIMSAT
APPARENTLY
BEGAN
WHEN
MATT
NEILSON
WENT
TO
TONGA
TO
VISIT
A
FRIEND
WHILE
HE
WAS
THERE
HE
SOMEHOW
ENDED
UP
VISITING
THE
KING
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
BE
A
BIG
TV
FAN
MATT
BOUGHT
THE
KING
A
SATELLITE
DISH
WHICH
THE
KING
THOUGHT
WAS
REALLY
NIFTY
SINCE
TONGA
HAS
A
GNP
OF
ABOUT
MILLION
HIS
MAJESTY
ASKED
IF
THERE
WAS
ANY
WAY
TO
MAKE
MONEY
OFF
THIS
MATT
THOUGHT
THERE
PROBABLY
WAS
SO
AT
HIS
SUGGESTION
TONGA
APPLIED
FOR
GEOSYNCHRONOUS
SATELLITE
SLOTS
WHILE
THIS
ISNT
ENTIRELY
OFF
THE
WALL
IT
WAS
VERY
UNUSUAL
SEEING
AS
TONGA
WAS
A
TINY
KINGDOM
WITH
NO
SPACE
PROGRAM
AND
IS
A
LOT
OF
SLOTS
THE
WHOLE
THING
WAS
DEBATED
IN
THE
APPROPRIATE
REGULATORY
AGENCY
AND
CARL
HILLIARD
WHO
IS
APPARENTLY
A
RESPECTED
SPACE
LAWYER
WROTE
SEVERAL
OPINIONS
SUPPORTING
TONGAS
CASE
EVENTUALLY
TONGA
ENDED
UP
WITH
SLOTS
RANGING
FROM
E
TO
E
SLOTS
ARE
DESIGNATED
BY
THE
LONGITUDE
OVER
WHICH
THEY
RESIDE
ACCORDING
TO
STERNBERG
FOUR
OF
THESE
FROM
E
TO
E
ARE
THE
BEST
IN
THE
WORLD
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
EXCELLENTLY
PLACED
FOR
COMMUNICATIONS
BETWEEN
HAWAII
AND
THE
PACIFIC
RIM
RIMSAT
WAS
FORMED
TO
USE
THESE
SLOTS
IT
WAS
OFFICIALLY
FORMED
IN
NEVIS
AS
A
TAX
HAVEN
THEY
TRIED
FOR
A
FEW
YEARS
TO
RAISE
FUNDS
IN
THE
WEST
HOWEVER
TO
FILL
SLOTS
WITH
WESTERN
SATELLITES
LAUNCHED
ON
WESTERN
LAUNCHERS
WOULD
HAVE
COST
APPROXIMATELY
BILLION
ITS
NOT
EASY
TO
RAISE
THAT
KIND
OF
MONEY
EVENTUALLY
THEY
HIT
UPON
THE
IDEA
OF
USING
RUSSIAN
HARDWARE
THEY
BEGAN
NEGOTIATING
WITH
GLAVKOSMOS
FOR
HARDWARE
MR
STERNBERG
DESCRIBES
OPERATING
IN
MOSCOW
IN
SUCH
HARSH
TERMS
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
ILL
VISIT
THERE
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BESIDES
A
SIGNIFICANT
LACK
OF
CREATURE
COMFORTS
HE
WAS
NOT
HAPPY
WITH
THE
WAY
THAT
PEOPLE
OPERATE
FOR
EXAMPLE
EVERYBODY
CAN
SELL
YOU
EVERYTHING
EVERYONE
CAN
SHOW
THE
PROPER
DOCUMENTS
AND
LICENSES
THAT
INDICATE
THEY
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
SELL
WHAT
EVER
YOU
WANT
TO
BY
EVENTUALLY
RIMSAT
ARRANGED
A
DEAL
WITH
GLAVKOSMOS
FOR
SATELLITES
AT
A
COST
OF
MILLION
HOWEVER
GLAVKOSMOS
LOST
FAVOR
AFTER
THE
COUP
STERNBERG
SAYS
THAT
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
BASICALLY
A
BUNCH
OF
KGB
OPERATIVES
WHO
WENT
TO
TRADE
SHOWS
AND
PICKED
UP
LOTS
OF
BROCHURES
SINCE
GLAVKOSMOS
WAS
OUT
OF
POWER
HE
HAD
TO
RENEGOTIATE
THE
DEAL
WITH
THE
NEW
AUTHORITIES
HE
AGAIN
DESCRIBED
LIFE
IN
A
MOSCOW
HOTEL
IN
RATHER
UNFAVORABLE
TERMS
EVENTUALLY
HE
WORKED
OUT
A
DEAL
AND
ON
DEC
HE
MET
WITH
KOPTEV
WHO
HEADS
THE
RUSSIAN
SPACE
PROGRAM
TO
SIGN
THE
DEAL
KOPTEV
INSISTED
ON
A
FEW
CONCESSIONS
BEFORE
SIGNING
AND
ACCORDING
TO
STERNBERG
HE
ARRANGED
THESE
NEW
RULES
TO
ALLOW
HIMSELF
TO
FORM
ANOTHER
COMPANY
TO
DO
THE
EXACT
SAME
THING
AS
RIMSAT
THE
NEXT
STEP
WAS
TO
MEET
WITH
THE
BUILDERS
OF
THE
HARDWARE
NPO
APPLIED
MECHANICS
NPO
PM
TO
USE
THEIR
ACRONYM
THIS
ORGANIZATION
IS
LOCATED
IN
SIBERIA
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
TO
SPELL
THE
TOWN
I
NEED
AN
ATLAS
AND
HAS
BUILT
ABOUT
VEHICLES
SINCE
THE
DAWN
OF
THE
SPACE
AGE
STERNBERG
COMMENTED
THAT
SIBERIANS
ARE
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
MUSOVITES
THEY
ARE
HARD
WORKERS
HONEST
PEOPLE
WHO
TEAM
UP
TO
GET
THINGS
DONE
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
MIDWESTERNERS
AT
THIS
POINT
THERE
WERE
SOME
COMMENTS
FROM
THE
AUDIENCE
THAT
AGREED
WITH
HIS
OPINION
ON
BOTH
SIBERIANS
AND
MIDWESTERNERS
STERNBERG
HAD
LOTS
OF
GOOD
THINGS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
NPO
PM
HIS
COMPANY
IS
APPARENTLY
LOOKNG
FOR
MILLION
TO
INVEST
IN
THE
FIRM
TO
BECOME
PARTNERSIT
APPARENTLY
COSTS
THE
RUSSIANS
ABOUT
MILLION
TO
BUILD
A
SATELLITE
THAT
WOULD
SELL
FOR
MILLION
IN
THE
WEST
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
GIVE
THEM
SPECIFICATIONS
THEYLL
BUILD
YOU
A
SATELLITE
FOR
THE
PARTICULAR
SATELLITES
THAT
RIMSAT
WILL
BE
USING
COSTS
RUN
ABOUT
PER
TRANSPONDER
YEAR
THIS
COMPARES
TO
TY
IN
THE
US
THEY
CAN
SELL
THEIR
TIME
FOR
ABOUT
MILLION
COMPARED
TO
MILLION
IN
THE
US
RIMSAT
WILL
LAUNCH
THEIR
SATELLITES
ON
PROTONS
TO
GET
THE
BEST
PRICES
THEY
BOUGHT
IN
BULK
THEY
HAVE
THE
RIGHTS
TO
TWELVE
LAUNCHES
SO
IF
ANY
OF
YOU
NEED
A
LIFT
I
CAN
GIVE
YOU
THEIR
ADDRESS
THE
FIRST
LAUNCH
IS
SCHEDULED
FOR
OCTOBER
AND
THEY
ARE
GETTING
ONE
USED
SATELLITE
FROM
THE
RUSSIANS
WHICH
IS
BEING
MOVED
INTO
PLACE
NOW
TIDBITS
STERNBERG
SAYS
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
HAS
TO
BE
DONE
BY
ENTREPRENEURS
NOT
BIG
BUSINESS
BECAUSE
BIG
BUSINESS
IS
JUST
LIKE
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
OVER
THERE
EXCEPT
THAT
WE
HAVE
BETTER
PAPER
BOTH
IN
THE
BATHROOM
AND
IN
THE
COPIER
RUSSIAN
LAUNCHES
ARE
SELF
INSURED
THE
PROMISE
TO
REPLACE
A
FAILED
LAUNCH
WITHIN
MONTHS
MAJOR
INVESTORS
IN
RIMSAT
INCLUDE
RUSSELL
WHICH
IS
A
HUGE
RETIREMENT
FUND
ORGANIZATION
CELLSAT
WHICH
IS
A
BIG
TELECOM
BUSINESS
IN
SOUTHEAST
ASIA
AND
A
FUND
OPERATED
BY
SOME
OF
THE
BIG
NAMES
IN
US
AEROSPACE
WHICH
HE
SAYS
IS
SORT
OF
AN
INSURANCE
POLICY
FOR
THEM
IF
THIS
REALLY
TAKES
OFF
HE
DOWNPLAYED
THE
INSTABILITES
IN
THE
EXUSSR
SAYING
THAT
WE
ARE
WORRIED
PARTLY
BECAUSE
WE
ARENT
USED
TO
SEEING
RUSSIA
AS
ANYTHING
BUT
AN
UNVARYING
MONOLITH
ITALY
GETS
A
NEW
GOVERNMENT
EVERY
TWO
WEEKS
BUT
WE
DONT
WORRY
BECAUSE
WERE
USED
TO
IT
HE
PREDICTED
THAT
ONCE
WE
GET
USED
TO
SEEING
WHAT
REALLY
GOES
ON
IN
RUSSIA
WE
WONT
WORRY
ABOUT
THEIR
STABILITY
AS
MUCH
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
COOPERATIVE
VENTURES
IS
THE
PROBLEM
OF
TRANSFERING
MONEY
THE
CENTRAL
BANK
HAS
A
POLICY
OF
TAKING
HARD
CURRENCY
PAYMENTS
PUTTING
IN
THEIR
COFFERS
AND
REPLACING
THE
REST
WITH
THE
EQUIVALENT
VALUE
IN
RUBLES
TO
GET
AROUND
THIS
RIMSAT
PAYS
THEIR
HARD
CURRENCY
INTO
AN
AUSTRIAN
BANK
ACCOUNT
NPO
PM
THEN
PAYS
THEIR
CONTRACTORS
WITH
FOREIGN
CURRENCY
SO
THAT
THE
ONLY
THE
CONTRACTORS
GET
SWINDLED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
ONE
OF
THE
BIG
PROBLEMS
RIMSAT
HAS
HAD
IS
STONEWALLING
BY
THE
WESTERN
SATELLITE
INDUSTRY
HOWEVER
INTELSAT
RECENTLY
BOUGHT
THREE
OF
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
SATELLITES
WHICH
WAS
RATHER
REASSURING
THE
BIGGEST
WORRY
MOST
PEOPLE
HAVE
ABOUT
RUSSIAN
SATELLITES
IS
THE
PRIMITIVE
TECHNOLOGY
AND
SHORTER
LIFETIME
THE
OLDER
GORIZONT
HORIZON
SATELLITES
HAVE
A
LIFETIME
OF
ABOUT
YEARS
WHILE
THE
MORE
MODERN
EXPRESS
SATELLITES
COMPARE
WELL
WITH
WESTERN
TECHNOLOGY
AND
LAST
ABOUT
YEARS
WHILE
THIS
IS
MUCH
SHORTER
THAN
YEARS
FOR
WESTERN
SATELLITES
STERNBERG
DOWNPLAYED
THE
DIFFERENCE
AT
THESE
PRICES
THEY
CAN
AFFORD
TO
LAUNCH
NEW
ONES
IN
ADDITION
SHORTER
LIFETIMES
MEAN
THAT
THEY
CAN
REPLACE
THEIR
EQUIPMENT
WITH
NEWER
TECHNOLOGY
SO
THEY
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
COMPETE
BETTER
THAN
OLDER
OUT
OF
DATE
HARDWARE
