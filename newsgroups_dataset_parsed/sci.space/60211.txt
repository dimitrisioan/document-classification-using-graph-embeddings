RE
ABYSS
BREATHING
FLUIDS
IN
ARTICLE
ACHURIST
WRITES
I
BELIEVE
THE
REASON
IS
THAT
THE
LUNG
DIAPHRAM
GETS
TOO
TIRED
TO
PUMP
THE
LIQUID
IN
AND
OUT
AND
SIMPLY
STOPS
BREATHING
AFTER
MINUTES
SO
IF
YOUR
IN
THE
VEHICLE
READY
TO
GO
THEY
BETTER
NOT
PUT
YOU
ON
HOLD
OR
ELSE
THATS
ABOUT
IT
REMEMBER
A
LIQUID
IS
SEVERAL
MORE
TIMES
AS
DENSE
AS
A
GAS
BY
ITS
VERY
NATURE
I
THINK
DEPENDING
ON
THE
GAS
AND
LIQUID
COMPARISION
OF
COURSE
COULD
YOU
USE
SOME
SORT
OF
MECHANICAL
CHEST
COMPRESSION
AS
AN
AID
SORTA
LIKE
THE
PORTABLE
IRON
LUNG
PUT
SOME
SORT
OF
FLEX
TUBING
AROUND
THE
AQUANAUTS
CHEST
CYCLICALLY
COMPRESS
IT
AND
IT
WILL
PUSH
ENOUGH
ON
THE
CHEST
WALL
TO
SUPPORT
BREATHING
YOUD
HAVE
TO
TRUST
YOUR
BREATHER
BUT
IN
SPACE
YOU
HAVE
TO
TRUST
YOUR
SUIT
ANYWAY
PAT
