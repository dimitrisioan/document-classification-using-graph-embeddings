you
dare
posting
i
posed
these
very
questions
to
mr
spencer
some
time
ago
by
email
unfortunately
i
never
received
any
response
apologies
your
mail
is
probably
in
the
pile
that
arrived
just
before
i
got
sick
about
a
month
ago
a
reply
will
appear
eventually
now
what
i
really
would
like
to
see
is
an
interview
with
mr
spencer
a
magazine
photograph
or
even
better
a
tv
program
no
i
want
both
so
far
there
have
been
none
unless
you
count
an
interview
in
the
amateur
computerist
about
the
history
of
netnews
which
may
be
disqualified
because
tacs
budget
doesnt
run
to
reproducing
photos
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
