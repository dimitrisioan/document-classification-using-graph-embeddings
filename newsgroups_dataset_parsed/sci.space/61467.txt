re
temperature
of
the
dark
sky

stupendous
man
writes
if
thats
the
case
let
me
point
out
that
interstellar
dust
and
molecules
provide
many
instances
of
things
that
are
well
nottoofar
from
being
blackbodies
many
different
observations
including
iras
and
cobe
have
determined
that
interstellar
dust
grain
temperatures
can
range
from
to
interstellar
grains
are
not
at
all
close
to
blackbodies
the
large
grains
have
sizes
of
order
micron
and
absorb
visible
light
with
fair
efficiency
however
at
temperatures
below
k
of
the
thermal
emission
will
be
beyond
microns
where
radiating
efficiency
is
poor
a
small
antenna
cannot
easily
radiate
at
long
wavelengths
thus
the
grains
must
heat
up
more
in
order
to
radiate
the
energy
they
have
absorbed
moreover
the
iras
observations
had
a
maximum
wavelength
of
microns
grains
colder
than
k
will
radiate
primarily
at
longer
wavelengths
and
iras
would
be
relatively
insensitive
to
them
in
the
extreme
limit
grains
as
cold
as
k
will
be
almost
undetectable
by
any
conceivable
observation
worse
still
iras
color
temperatures
are
heavily
contaminated
by
a
population
of
small
grains
these
grains
have
only
perhaps
atoms
and
when
they
are
hit
by
a
single
photon
they
heat
up
to
temperatures
of
several
hundred
or
k
of
course
they
cool
quickly
and
then
stay
cold
for
a
while
but
when
they
are
radiating
the
characteristic
temperature
is
several
hundred
k
even
a
small
population
of
these
grains
can
dramatically
raise
the
observed
average
temperature
a
model
for
local
infrared
emission
consistent
with
cobe
data
has
three
components
these
represent
scattered
radiation
from
zodiacal
dust
color
temperature
k
thermal
emission
from
zodiacal
dust
tc
k
and
thermal
emission
from
galactic
dust
k
at
the
ecliptic
poles
the
emissivities
or
dilution
factors
are
respectively
and
the
first
two
are
roughly
doubled
in
the
ecliptic
plane
to
find
the
thermal
equilibrium
temperature
we
add
up
the
dilution
factor
times
the
fourth
power
of
temperature
for
all
components
then
take
the
fourth
root
in
the
table
below
starlight
comes
from
allens
number
that
stellar
emission
from
the
whole
sky
is
equivalent
to
zero
mag
stars
with
bv
color
of
no
doubt
careful
work
could
do
much
better
the
person
who
suggested
starlight
had
a
dilution
factor
of
must
have
been
remembering
wrong
we
would
be
cooked
if
that
were
the
case
in
any
event
the
energy
density
of
starlight
comes
out
about
the
same
as
that
of
the
microwave
background
and
i
believe
that
to
be
correct
dilution
temp
microwave
background
galactic
dust
zodiacal
dust
emission
zodiacal
dust
scattering
starlight
the
fourth
root
of
is
k
outside
the
solar
system
the
result
would
be
k
i
find
these
results
surprising
especially
the
importance
of
zodiacal
dust
but
i
dont
see
any
serious
mistakes
