STUPENDOUS

WRITES
IF
THATS
THE
CASE
LET
ME
POINT
OUT
THAT
INTERSTELLAR
DUST
AND
MOLECULES
PROVIDE
MANY
INSTANCES
OF
THINGS
THAT
ARE
WELL
NOTTOOFAR
FROM
BEING
BLACKBODIES
MANY
DIFFERENT
OBSERVATIONS
INCLUDING
IRAS
AND
COBE
HAVE
DETERMINED
THAT
INTERSTELLAR
DUST
GRAIN
TEMPERATURES
CAN
RANGE
FROM
TO
INTERSTELLAR
GRAINS
ARE
NOT
AT
ALL
CLOSE
TO
BLACKBODIES
THE
LARGE
GRAINS
HAVE
SIZES
OF
ORDER
MICRON
AND
ABSORB
VISIBLE
LIGHT
WITH
FAIR
EFFICIENCY
HOWEVER
AT
TEMPERATURES
BELOW
K
OF
THE
THERMAL
EMISSION
WILL
BE
BEYOND
MICRONS
WHERE
RADIATING
EFFICIENCY
IS
POOR
A
SMALL
ANTENNA
CANNOT
EASILY
RADIATE
AT
LONG
WAVELENGTHS
THUS
THE
GRAINS
MUST
HEAT
UP
MORE
IN
ORDER
TO
RADIATE
THE
ENERGY

GRAINS

RADIATE
PRIMARILY
AT

AND
IRAS
WOULD
BE
RELATIVELY
INSENSITIVE
TO
THEM

GRAINS

TEMPERATURES

HEAVILY
CONTAMINATED
BY
A
POPULATION
OF

THESE
GRAINS
HAVE
ONLY
PERHAPS
ATOMS
AND
WHEN
THEY
ARE
HIT
BY
A
SINGLE
PHOTON
THEY
HEAT
UP
TO
TEMPERATURES
OF
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
OR
K
OF
COURSE
THEY
COOL
QUICKLY
AND
THEN
STAY
COLD
FOR
A
WHILE
BUT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
RADIATING
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
TEMPERATURE
IS
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
K
EVEN
A
SMALL
POPULATION
OF
THESE
GRAINS
CAN
DRAMATICALLY
RAISE
THE

A
MODEL

AT
THE

POLES
THE
EMISSIVITIES
OR
DILUTION
FACTORS
ARE
RESPECTIVELY
AND
THE
FIRST
TWO
ARE
ROUGHLY
DOUBLED
IN
THE
ECLIPTIC
PLANE
TO
FIND
THE
THERMAL
EQUILIBRIUM
TEMPERATURE
WE
ADD
UP
THE

THE
