somebody
pointed
out
quite
correctly
that
such
rights
are
not
anybodys
to
grant
although
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
fait
accompli
situation
for
the
winner
so
how
about
this
give
the
winning
group
i
cant
see
one
company
or
corp
doing
it
a
or
year
moratorium
on
taxes
tom
freebairn
who
says
there
is
no
mineral
rights
to
be
given
who
says
the
un
or
the
us
government
toms
right
about
this
its
only
a
grantable
right
if
the
granter
has
the
will
and
the
ability
to
stop
anyone
from
taking
it
away
from
you
never
mind
the
legal
status
major
question
is
if
you
decide
to
mine
the
moon
or
mars
who
will
stop
you
the
un
cant
other
than
legal
tom
foolerie
can
the
truly
inforce
it
nicks
right
about
this
its
always
easier
to
obtain
forgiveness
than
permission
not
many
people
remember
that
britains
king
george
iii
expressly
forbid
his
american
subjects
to
cross
the
alleghanyappalachian
mountains
said
subjects
basically
said
stop
us
if
you
can
he
couldnt
if
you
go
to
the
moon
as
declare
that
you
are
now
a
soverign
nation
who
will
stop
you
from
doing
it
maybe
not
acknowledge
you
thats
how
the
usa
started
of
course
thats
also
how
the
bolivarian
republic
started
ca
in
central
america
it
didnt
have
quite
the
staying
power
of
the
usa
im
sure
there
are
more
examples
of
going
far
away
and
then
ignoring
authority
but
none
jump
to
mind
right
now
what
can
happen
is
to
find
a
nation
which
is
acknowledged
and
offer
your
services
as
a
space
miner
and
then
go
mine
the
asteroidsmarsmoon
or
what
ever
as
long
as
yur
sponsor
does
not
get
in
trouble
or
do
as
some
whaling
nations
do
define
whatever
activities
you
want
to
carry
out
as
scientific
research
which
just
coincidentally
requires
the
recovery
of
megatonnes
of
minerals
or
whatever
then
go
at
it
basically
find
a
country
who
wants
to
go
into
space
but
cant
for
soem
reason
or
another
but
who
will
give
you
a
home
such
as
saudia
arabia
or
whatever
lute
keyser
had
just
this
sort
of
arrangement
with
libya
i
think
in
the
late
for
his
commercial
space
launch
project
one
of
the
very
earliest
it
was
killed
by
soviet
propaganda
about
nato
cruise
missiles
in
africa
which
made
libya
renege
on
the
arrangement
doug
loss
