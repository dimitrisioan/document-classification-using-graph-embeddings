if
this
idea
goes
through
its
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
soon
companies
will
be
doing
larger
and
more
permanant
billboards
in
the
sky
i
wouldnt
want
a
world
a
few
decades
from
now
when
the
sky
looks
like
las
vegas
that
would
really
make
me
sad
think
for
a
moment
about
the
technology
required
to
do
that
by
the
time
they
could
make
the
earths
sky
look
like
las
vegas
the
people
could
afford
to
go
backpacking
on
the
moon
round
trip
costs
for
kg
to
the
moon
would
be
about
the
same
as
kg
in
a
low
earth
advertising
orbit
very
roughly
the
same
cost
as
a
smallish
billboard
therefore
if
such
ads
were
to
become
common
place
that
would
have
to
be
a
very
low
price
this
is
nonsense
its
like
saying
that
by
the
time
commercials
on
television
become
commonplace
every
citizen
will
have
their
own
hour
long
nationally
broadcast
tv
program
theres
always
been
a
problem
of
having
to
get
away
from
civilization
before
you
can
really
find
natural
scenery
years
ago
this
usually
didnt
take
a
trip
of
over
miles
today
most
people
would
have
to
go
miles
or
more
if
we
ever
get
to
the
point
where
we
have
billboards
on
orbit
that
essentially
means
that
no
place
on
earth
is
still
wild
while
that
may
or
may
not
be
a
good
thing
the
orbital
billboards
arent
the
problem
they
are
just
a
symptom
of
growing
denselypopulated
civilization
banning
such
ads
will
not
save
your
view
of
the
night
sky
because
by
the
time
such
ads
could
become
widespread
you
will
probably
have
trouble
finding
a
place
without
street
lights
where
you
can
see
the
stars
the
rest
of
your
post
is
strange
mishmash
of
its
already
really
bad
and
it
doesnt
really
matter
if
it
gets
worse
you
should
try
to
figure
out
what
you
are
really
arguing
for
kneejerk
antienviron
mentalism

a
passing
sattelite
does
not

as
an
object
as
bright
as
the
full
moon
