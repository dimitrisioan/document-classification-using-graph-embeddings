DO
YOU
KNOW
OF
A
PRIVATE
TITAN
PAD
NOBODY
WHO
IS
INTERESTED
IN
LAUNCHING
THINGS
CHEAPLY
WILL
BUY
TITANS
IT
DOESNT
TAKE
MANY
TITAN
PRICETAGS
TO
PAY
FOR
A
LASER
LAUNCHER
OR
A
LARGE
GAS
GUN
OR
A
DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM
FOR
A
BIG
DUMB

HENRY
I
MADE
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
HE
WHO
GETS
THERE
FIRSTEST
WITH
THE
MOSTEST
WINS
ONLY
IF
HE
DOESNT
SPEND
MORE
THAN
A
BILLION
DOLLARS
DOING
IT
SINCE
THE
PRIZE
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
SCALED
UP
TO

THE

OF

YOU
CAN
SPEND
A
BILLION
PRETTY
QUICKLY
BUYING
TITAN
LAUNCHES
WHATS
MORE
IF
YOU
BUY
TITANS
THE
PRIZE
MONEY
IS
YOUR
ENTIRE
RETURN
ON
INVESTMENT
IF
YOU
DEVELOP
A
NEW
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
IT
HAS
OTHER
USES
AND
THE
PRIZE
IS
JUST
THE
ICING
ON
THE
CAKE
I
DOUBT
VERY
MUCH
THAT
A
BILLIONDOLLAR
PRIZE
IS
GOING
TO
SHOW
ENOUGH
RETURN
TO
JUSTIFY
THE
INVESTMENT
IF
YOU
ARE
CONSTRAINED
TO
USE
CURRENT

THERE
WOULD
SURELY
BE
A
BUYAMERICAN
CLAUSE
IN
THE
RULES
FOR
SUCH
A
PRIZE
SINCE
IT
WOULD
PRETTY
WELL
HAVE
TO
BE
GOVERNMENTFUNDED
YOURE
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
INVEST
YOUR
FRONT
MONEY
IN
BUILDING
A
NEW
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
RATHER
THAN
PISSING
IT
AWAY
ON
EXISTING
ONES
BEING
THERE
FIRST
IS
OF
NO
IMPORTANCE
IF
YOU
GO
BANKRUPT
DOING
IT
COULD
I
GET
A

I
WANNA
DO
SOME

WHILE

UP
THERE
IM
SURE
SPAR
WOULD
OFFER
TO

SUCH
A
LUNARTUNED
SYSTEM
AND
DELIVER
A

OF
THEM
TO
YOU
FOR
ONLY
A
COUPLE
OF
