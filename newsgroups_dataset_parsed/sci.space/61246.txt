youd
need
to
launch

to

up
large
amounts

stuff
do
you
know
of
a
private
titan
pad
nobody
who
is
interested
in
launching
things
cheaply
will
buy
titans
it
doesnt
take
many
titan
pricetags
to
pay
for
a
laser
launcher
or
a
large
gas
gun
or
a
development
program
for
a
big
dumb
booster
all
of
which
would
have
far
better
costeffectiveness

i
made
the
assumption
that
he
who
gets
there
firstest
with
the
mostest
wins
only
if
he
doesnt
spend
more
than
a
billion
dollars
doing
it
since
the
prize
is
not
going
to
be
scaled
up
to
match
the
level
of
effort
you
can
spend
a
billion
pretty
quickly
buying
titan
launches
whats
more
if
you
buy
titans
the
prize
money
is
your
entire
return
on
investment
if
you
develop
a
new
launch
system
it
has
other
uses
and
the
prize
is
just
the
icing
on
the
cake
i
doubt
very
much
that
a
billiondollar
prize
is
going
to
show
enough
return
to
justify
the
investment
if
you
are
constrained
to
use
current
us
launchers
there
would
surely
be
a
buyamerican
clause
in
the
rules
for
such
a
prize
since
it
would
pretty
well
have
to
be
governmentfunded
youre
going
to
have
to
invest
your
front
money
in
building
a
new
launch
system
rather
than
pissing
it
away
on
existing
ones
being
there
first
is
of
no
importance
if
you
go
bankrupt
doing
it
could
i
get
a
couple
of
canadarms
tuned
for
the
lunar
environment
i
wanna
do
some
teleoperated
prospecting
while
im
up
there
im
sure
spar
would
offer
to
develop
such
a
lunartuned
system
and
deliver
a
couple
of
them
to
you
for
only
a
couple
of
hundred
million
dollars
resembles
a
highspeed
