HELLO
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
A
PROGRAM
OR
ALGORITHM
THAT
CAN
BE
USED
TO
COMPUTE
SUNRISE
AND
SUNSET
TIMES
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
ADVICE
I
ONCE
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
BE
EASIEST
FITTING
A
SINE
TO
THE
TIMES
BUT
NOT
THIS
GAVE
DISCREPANCY
OF
UPTO
SIX
MINUTES
IF
YOU
FIT
A
SINE
SERIES
YOULL
GET
A
VERY
GOOD
FIT
AFTER
JUST
THREE
OR
FOUR
TERMS
THOUGH
THIS
PRESUMABLY
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
THE
ECCENTRICITY
