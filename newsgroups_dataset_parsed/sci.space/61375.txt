if
i
read
you
correctly
you
may
be
asking
if
i
put
a
blackbody
in
interstellar
space
disregarding
the
sun
and
nearby
large
warm
objects
what
termperature
will
it
reach
in
thermal
equilibrium
with
the
ambient
radiation
field
basically
the
right
question
although
i
was
interested
in
cases
closer
to
home
where
the
sun
is
behind
either
a
natural
object
or
effective
shielding
if
thats
the
case
let
me
point
out
that
interstellar
dust
and
molecules
provide
many
instances
of
things
that
are
well
nottoofar
from
being
blackbodies
inside
the
disk
of
the
galaxy
the
temperature
varies
quite
a
bit
from
place
to
place
good
point
and
thanks
for
the
references
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
