the
onboard
flight
software
project
was
rated
level
by
a
nasa
team
this
group
generates
kslocs
of
verified
code
per
year
for
nasa
will
someone
tell
an
ignorant
physicist
where
the
term
level
comes
from
it
sounds
like
the
risks
digest
equivalent
of
large
extra
large
jumbo
or
maybe
its
like
defcon
i
gather
it
means
that
shuttle
software
was
developed
with
extreme
care
to
have
reliablility
and
safety
and
almost
everything
else
in
the
computing
world
is
level
or
cheesy
dimestore
software
not
surprising
but
who
is
it
that
invents
this
standard
and
how
come
everyone
but
me
seems
to
be
familiar
with
it
level
refers
to
the
carnegiemellon
software
engineering
institutes
capability
maturity
model
this
model
rates
software
development
orgs
with
being
chaotic
and
being
optimizing
dod
is
beginning
to
use
this
rating
system
as
a
discriminator
in
contracts
i
have
more
data
on
thifrom
page
to
i
have
a
page
presentation
that
summarizes
it
wethat
i
