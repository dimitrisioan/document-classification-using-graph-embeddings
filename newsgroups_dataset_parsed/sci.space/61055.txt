RE
SUNRISE
SUNSET
TIMES
A
RELATED
QUESTION
WHICH
I
HAVENT
GIVEN
THAT
MUCH
SERIOUS
THOUGHT
TO
AT
WHAT
LATTITUDE
IS
THE
AVERAGE
LENGTH
OF
THE
DAY
AVERAGED
OVER
THE
WHOLE
YEAR
MAXIMIZED
IS
THIS
FUNCTION
A
CONSTANT
HOURS
IS
IT
TRULY
SYMMETRIC
ABOUT
THE
EQUATOR
OR
IS
THERE
SOME
DISCREPANCY
DUE
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ORBIT
IS
ELLIPTIC
OR
MAYBE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
ENOUGH
TO
CHANGE
THE
TEMPERATURE
AND
MAKE
THE
SEASONS
IN
THE
SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE
MORE
BITTER
BUT
IS
FAR
TOO
SMALL
TO
MAKE
A
SIZEABLE
DIFFERENCE
IN
DAYLIGHT
HOURS
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHERE
TO
