apollo
was
done
the
hard
way
in
a
big
hurry
from
a
very
limited
technology
base
and
on
government
contracts
just
doing
it
privately
rather
than
as
a
government
project
cuts
costs
by
a
factor
of
several
so
how
much
would
it
cost
as
a
private
venture
assuming
you
could
talk
the
us
government
into
leasing
you
a
couple
of
pads
in
florida
why
use
a
ground
launch
pad
it
is
entirely
posible
to
launch
from
altitude
this
was
what
the
shuttle
was
originally
intended
to
do
it
might
be
seriously
cheaper
also
what
about
bioengineered
absorbing
plants
instead
of
many
lox
bottles
stick
em
in
a
lunar
cave
and
put
an
airlock
on
the
door

and
they
shall
not
find
those
things
with
a
sort
of
rafia
like
base
that
their
fathers
put
there
just
the
night
before
at
about
oclock
