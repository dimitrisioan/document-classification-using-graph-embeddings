we
dont
reprocess
nuclear
fuel
because
what
you
get
from
the
reprocessing
plant
is
bombgrade
plutonium
it
is
also
cheaper
given
current
prices
of
things
to
simply
fabricate
new
fuel
rods
rather
than
reprocess
the
old
ones
creating
potentially
dangerous
materials
from
a
national
security
point
of
view
and
then
fabricate
that
back
into
fuel
rods
fabricating
with
reprocessed
plutonium
may
result
in
something
that
may
go
kind
of
boom
but
its
hardly
decent
bomb
grade
plutonium
if
you
want
bomb
grade
plutonium
use
a
research
reactor
not
a
power
reactor
but
if
you
want
a
bomb
dont
use
plutonium
use
uranium
