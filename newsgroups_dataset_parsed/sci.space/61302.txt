JIM
COBBAN
WRITES
HAVING
READ
IN
THE
PAST
ABOUT
THE
FAILSAFE
MECHANISMS
ON
SPACECRAFT
I
HAD
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
COMMAND
LOSS
TIMER
HAD
THAT
SORT
OF
FUNCTION
HOWEVER
I
ALWAYS
FIND
DISTURBING
THE
OXYMORON
OF
A
NOOP
COMMAND
THAT
DOES
SOMETHING
IF
THE
COMMAND
CHANGES
THE
BEHAVIOR
OR
STATUS
OF
THE
SPACECRAFT
IT
IS
NOT
A
NOOP
COMMAND
USING
YOUR
ARGUMENT
THE
NOOP
OPERATION
IN
A
COMPUTER
ISNT
A
NOOP
SINCE
IT
CAUSES
THE
PC
TO
BE
INCREMENTED
OF
COURSE
THIS
TERMINOLOGY
COMES
FROM
A
JET
PROPULSION
LABORATORY
WHICH
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
JET
PROPULSION
OF
COURSE
THE
COMPLAINT
COMES
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
HASNT
A
CLUE

DISCLAIMER
HEY
I
UNDERSTAND
VAXEN

VMS
THATS
WHAT
I
GET
PAID
FOR
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
ASTRONOMY
IS
PURELY
AT
THE
AMATEUR
LEVEL
OR
BELOW
SO
UNLESS
WHAT
IM
SAYING
IS
DIRECTLY
RELATED
TO
VAXVMS
DONT
HOLD
ME
OR
MY
ORGANIZATION
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
IF
IT
IS
RELATED
TO
VAXVMS
YOU
CAN
TRY
TO
HOLD
ME
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
BUT
MY
ORGANIZATION
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
