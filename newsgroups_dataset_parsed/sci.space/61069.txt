on
the
outcome
of
their
experiments
today
europes
space
telecommunications
sector
would
not
be
blossoming
as
it
now
does
had
olympus
not
provided
a
testbed
for
the
technologies
and
services
of
the
this
summarises
the
general
conclusions
of
speakers
and
participants
at
the
conference
on
olympus
utilisation
held
in
seville
on
the
conference
was
organised
by
the
european
space
agency
esa
and
the
spanish
centre
for
the
development
of
industrial
technology
cdti
olympus
has
been
particularly
useful
in
bringing
satellite
telecommunications
to
thousands
of
new
users
thanks
to
satellite
terminals
with
very
small
antennas
vsats
olympus
experiments
have
tested
data
transmission
videoconferencing
business
television
distance
teaching
and
rural
telephony
to
give
but
a
few
examples
in
opening
the
door
to
new
telecommunications
services
which
could
not
be
accommodated
on
the
crowded
lower
frequency
bands
olympus
was
the
first
satellite
over
europe
to
offer
capacity
in
the
ghz
band
in
establishing
twoway
data
relay
links
olympus
received
for
the
first
time
in
europe
over
several
months
highvolume
data
from
a
lowearth
orbiting
spacecraft
and
then
distributed
it
to
various
centres
in
europe
when
olympus
was
launched
on
july
it
was
the
worlds
largest
telecommunications
satellite
and
no
other
satellite
has
yet
equalled
its
versatility
in
combining
four
different
payloads
in
a
wide
variety
of
frequency
bands
olympus
users
range
from
individual
experimenters
to
some
of
the
worlds
largest
businesses
access
to
the
satellite
is
given
in
order
to
test
new
telecommunications
techniques
or
services
over
the
past
four
years
some
companies
and
organisations
made
use
of
this
opportunity
as
well
as
over
members
of
the
eurostep
distancelearning
organisation
as
the
new
technologies
and
services
tested
by
these
olympus
users
enter
the
commercial
market
they
then
make
use
of
operational
satellites
such
as
those
of
eutelsat
olympus
utilisation
will
continue
through
and
when
the
spacecraft
will
run
out
of
fuel
as
it
approaches
the
end
of
its
design
life
