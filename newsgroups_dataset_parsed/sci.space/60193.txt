si
neatly
separates
the
concepts
of
mass
force
and
weight
which
have
gotten
horribly
tangled
up
in
the
us
system
this
is
not
a
problem
with
english
units
a
pound
is
defined
to
be
a
unit
of
force
period
there
is
a
perfectly
good
unit
called
the
slug
which
is
the
mass
of
an
object
weighing
lbs
at
sea
level
g
of
course
american
military
english
units
perhaps
us
real
english
types
were
once
taught
that
a
pound
is
mass
and
a
poundal
is
force
being
that
force
that
causes
pound
to
accelerate
at
we
had
a
rare
olde
tyme
doing
our
exams
in
those
units
and
metric
as
well
american
perhaps
but
nothing
military
about
it
i
learned
mostly
slugs
when
we
talked
english
units
in
high
school
physics
and
while
the
teacher
was
an
exnavy
fighter
jock
the
book
certainly
wasnt
produced
by
the
military
poundals
were
just
too
flinking
small
and
made
the
math
come
out
funny
sort
of
the
same
reason
proponents
of
si
give
for
using
that
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
