re
surviving
large
accelerations

humans
and
this
was
published
in
have
already
withstood
accelerations
of
all
this
is
very
longwinded
but
heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in
fact
humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of
course

are
you
sure
is
the
right
number
as
far
as
i
know
pilots
are
blackout
in
dives
that
exceed
seems
to
be
out
of
human
tolerance
would
anybody
clarify
this
please
actually
both
numbers
are
correct
the
difference
is
in
the
direction
of
the
acceleration
for
pilots
accelerations
tend
to
be
transverse
to
the
direction
youre
facing
pulling
out
from
a
steep
dive
the
acceleration
will
force
blood
toward
your
feet
for
instance
in
this
case
you
can
only
put
up
with
about
gs
even
with
a
pressure
suit
the
record
for
acceleration
though
is
measured
along
the
direction
youre
facing
for
lack
of
a
better
term
as
i
recall
this
record
was
set
in
rocket
sleds
back
in
the
and
was
about
gs
or
so
