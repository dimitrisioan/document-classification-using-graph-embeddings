heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in
fact
humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of
course
if
these
are
possible
what
is
used
to
absorb
the
acceleration
this
sounds
a
bit
high
to
me
still
higher
accelerations
have
been
endured
very
briefly
during
violent
deceleration
if
were
talking
sustained
acceleration
i
think
gees
has
been
demonstrated
using
water
immersion
i
doubt
that
any
of
this
generalizes
to
another
order
of
magnitude
all
work
is
one
mans
