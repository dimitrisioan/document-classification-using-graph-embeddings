HUH
PLEASE
STATE
YOUR
CRITERIA
FOR
SELECTING
THE
GREATEST
PHILOSOPHER
TITLE
PS
EVER
READ
ANY
NIETZSCHE
GREATEST
MOST
LIKELY
TO
BE
REMEMBERED
FIVE
HUNDRED
YEARS
HENCE
I
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
THAT
MAKES
MANY
OF
MY
PERSONAL
FAVORITES
NOT
THAT
GREAT
I
MAKE
NO
COMMENT
ON
NIETZCHE
EXCEPT
TO
REMARK
THAT
HE
WAS
NO
IMMANUEL
KANT
INTERPRET
THAT
CRYPTIC
REMARK
AS
YOU
PLEASE
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
APPENDED
THAT
REMARK
THAT
NIETZCHE
WAS
NO
KANT
WITH
THANKFULLY
I
HAVENT
READ
ENOUGH
OF
EITHER
TO
COMMENT
ALTHOUGH
EVERYONE
TELLS
ME
I
SHOULD
READ
NIETZCHE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
GREATEST
PHILOSOPHER
TITLE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GO
TO
PLATO
SINCE
THE
WHOLE
ENTERPRISE
OF
PHILOSOPHY
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
DEFINED
BY
HIM
ALTHOUGH
HE
GOT
MOST
OF
HIS
ANSWERS
WRONG
HE
DID
DEFINITIVELY
IDENTIFY
WHAT
THE
IMPORTANT
QUESTIONS
ARE
I
THINK
IT
WAS
DESCARTES
WHO
SAID
THAT
ALL
PHILOSOPHY
IS
JUST
A
FOOTNOTE
TO
PLATO
IF
I
WERE
TO
CHOOSE
WHICH
PHILOSOPHER
MADE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
ADVANCES
IN
HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE
OVER
HIS
LIFETIME
THATS
SIMPLEIT
IS
ARISTOTLE
THIS
IS
SO
MUCH
THE
CASE
THAT
MANY
SIMPLY
REFER
TO
HIM
AS
THE
PHILOSOPHER
REGARDING
NIETZSCHE
HES
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
ENTERTAINING
ALTHOUGH
SINCE
HIS
IDEAS
WERE
SO
FRAGMENTED
AND
SINCE
HIS
LIFE
WAS
CUT
SHORT
IT
IS
DOUBTFUL
THAT
HIS
INFLUENCE
AS
A
PHILOSOPHER
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
VERY
EXTENSIVE
YEARS
FROM
NOW
THEYLL
PROBABLY
STILL
BE
READING
HIM
IN
YEARS
THOUGH
AS
FOR
MODERN
PHILOSOPHERS
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
KANT
WAS
THE
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
SINCE
HE
HAD
SUCH
A
STRONG
INFLUENCE
ON
ALMOST
EVERYONE
WHO
CAME
AFTER
HIM
AND
UNFORTUNATELY
THEY
MAINTAINED
HIS
ERRORS
AND
AMPLIFIED
THEM
OVER
TIME
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THE
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
AMERICAN
PHILOSOPHER
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
DEWEY
BUT
AS
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
PHILOSOPHER
WILL
BE
MOST
HIGHLY
REGARDED
IN
YEARS
IT
MAY
VERY
WELL
BE
AYN
RAND
WHO
IN
EVERY
IMPORTANT
RESPECT
WAS
AMERICAN
BUT
WAS
BORN
IN
RUSSIA
BUT
I
GUESS
THAT
REMAINS
TO
BE
SEEN
BRIAN
