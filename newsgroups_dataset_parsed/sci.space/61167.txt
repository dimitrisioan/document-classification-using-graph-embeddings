ALL
IN

IM
NOT
CERTAIN
THAT
THE

GOALPRIZE
OF
STAYING
ON

FOR
A

IS
WISE
ANDOR
USEFUL
HOW
ABOUT
A
PRIZE
FOR
THE
FIRST
NONGOVERNMENT
SPONSERED
UNMANNED

LANDING
THEN
ANOTHER
FOR
A
MANNED
MOON
LANDING

ANOTHER
FOR
A
REUSABLE
EARTHMOON
SHUTTLE
AND
SO
FORTH
FIND
SOME
WAY

INFRASTRUCTURE
HAVING
A

MIGHT
RESULT
IN
A
BUNCH
OF

GIVING
UP
AFTER

APPEARED
TO
WIN
AND
FOR
THOSE
THAT
DIDNT
GIVE
UP
I
FIND
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
SCARY
ABOUT
A
HALF
DOZEN

HUDDLING
IN

LIKE
TO
SEE
AS

A
REWARD
FOR

LASTLY
ABOUT
TEN
OR
FIFTEEN
YEARS
BACK
I
SEEM
TO
RECALL
THAT
THERE
WAS
AN
ENGLISH
SPACE
MAGAZINE
THAT
HAD
AN
ONGOING
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
MOONBASES
ON
THE
CHEAP
I
RECALLED
IT
DISCUSSED
THINGS
LIKE
HOW
MUCH
HEAT
THE
HUMAN
BODY
PRODUCED
HOW
MUCH
LUNAR
MATERIAL
ITD
NEED
FOR
PROTECTION
FROM
SOLAR
FLARES
ETC
UNFORTUNATELY
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE

DOES
THIS
RING
A

I
LOVE
THE
IDEA
OF
PROGRESSIVE
DEVELOPMENTAL
PRIZES
BUT
THE
ASSUMPTION
HAS
BEEN
ALL
ALONG
THAT
ONLY
THE
US
GUMMINT
COULD
FUND
THE
PRIZES
IT
WOULDNT
AND
COULDNT
DO
SUCH
A
THING
BUT
AN
ECCENTRIC

COULD
OFFER
SUCH
A
PRIZE
