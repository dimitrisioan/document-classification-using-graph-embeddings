writes
all
in
all
im
not
certain
that
the
single
goalprize
of
staying
on
the
moon
for
a
year
is
wise
andor
useful
how
about
a
prize
for
the
first
nongovernment
sponsered
unmanned
moon
landing
then
another
for
a
manned
moon
landing
then
yet
another
for
a
system
to
extract
consumables
from
lunar
soil
another
for
a
reusable
earthmoon
shuttle
and
so
forth
find
some
way
to
build
civilian
moonbase
infrastructure
having
a
single
goal
might
result
in
a
bunch
of
contestents
giving
up
after
one
person
appeared
to
win
and
for
those
that
didnt
give
up
i
find
something
a
little
scary
about
a
half
dozen
people
huddling
in
rickety
little
moon
shelters
id
like
to
see
as
much
a
reward
for
cooperation
as
for
competition
lastly
about
ten
or
fifteen
years
back
i
seem
to
recall
that
there
was
an
english
space
magazine
that
had
an
ongoing
discussion
about
moonbases
on
the
cheap
i
recalled
it
discussed
things
like
how
much
heat
the
human
body
produced
how
much
lunar
material
itd
need
for
protection
from
solar
flares
etc
unfortunately
i
dont
remember
the
name
of
this
magazine
does
this
ring
a
bell
to
anyone

i
love
the
idea
of
progressive
developmental
prizes
but
the
assumption
has
been
all
along
that
only
the
us
gummint
could
fund
the
prizes
it
wouldnt
and
couldnt
do
such
a
thing
but
an
eccentric
billionaire
could
offer
such
a
prize
or
series
of
prizes
