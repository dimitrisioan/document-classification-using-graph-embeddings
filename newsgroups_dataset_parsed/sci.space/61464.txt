is
there
a
plan
to
put
a
satellite
around
each
planet
in
the
solar
system
to
keep
watch
there
would
be
some
point
to
doing
longterm
monitoring
of
things
like
particles
and
fields
not
to
mention
atmospheric
phenomena
however
there
is
no
particular
plan
to
establish
any
sort
of
monitoring
network
to
be
precise
there
is
no
particular
plan
period
this
is
a
large
part
of
the
problem
in
this
context
its
not
surprising
that
unexciting
but
useful
missions
like
this
get
short
shrift
at
budget
time
the
closest
approach
to
any
sort
of
longterm
planetary
monitoring
mission
is
the
occasional
chance
to
piggyback
something
like
this
on
top
of
a
flashier
mission
like
galileo
or
cassini
how
about
a
mission
unmanned
to
pluto
to
stay
in
orbit
and
record
things
around
and
near
and
on
pluto
it
is
most
unlikely
that
there
is
much
happening
on
pluto
that
would
be
worth
monitoring
and
it
is
a
prohibitively
difficult
mission
to
fly
without
new
propulsion
technology
something
the
planetary
community
has
firmly
resisted
being
the
guinea
pigs
for
the
combined
need
to
arrive
at
pluto
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
and
then
kill
nearly
all
of
the
cruise
velocity
to
settle
into
an
orbit
is
beyond
what
can
reasonably
be
done
with
current
that
is
propulsion
it
could
do
some
scanning
of
not
only
pluto
but
also
of
the
solar
system
objects
near
and
aaroundpluto
as
well
as
seti
and
looking
at
the
galaxy
without
having
much
of
the
solar
system
to
worry
about
most
of
this
can
be
done
just
about
as
well
from
earth
the
few
things
that
cant
be
can
be
done
better
from
a
voyagerlike
spacecraft
that
is
not
constrained
by
the
need
to
enter
orbit
around
a
planet
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
