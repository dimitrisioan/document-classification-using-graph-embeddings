WRITES
IF
THE
JAPANESE
ARE
REALLY
GOING
FOR
NUKES
WHY
NOT
GO
WITH
BETTER
TECHNOLOGY
THEN
WE
HAVE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
BWRPWRS
HAVE
THEY
REALLY
CONSIDERED
SOME
OF

GENERATION
INHERENTLY
SAFE
DESIGNS
THE
JAPANESE
ARE
STILL
ON
THE
LEARNING
CURVE
AS
FAR
AS
NUCLEAR

GOES
THIS
MEANS
THAT
UNLIKE
THE
GERMANS
WHO
DO
GREAT
THINGS
ALL
BY

THE
JAPANESE
TIE
UP
WITH
FOREIGN

THE

IS
MITSUBISHI

I
THINK
NO
CHANCE
OF
A
NEW
DESIGN
SODIUM
HAS
LOTS
OF
CHEMICAL
PROBLEMS
BUT
IT
REALLY
SOLVES
DESIGN
DIFFICULTIES
OR
THE
INHERENTLY
SAFE
TYPES
SODIUM
HAS
LOTS
OF
CHEMICAL
PROBLEMS
LIKE
IT
EATS
STAINLESS
STEEL
VERY
SLOWLY
BUT
IT
GETS
THERE
IN
THE
END
NOT
WHAT
I
CALL
A
DESIRED
PROPERTY
AS
FOR
DESIGN
DIFFICULTIES
WHAT
DOES
SODIUM
DO
THERE
IT
IS
A
BITCH
AND
IT
IS
ONLY
ITS
CHEMICAL
PROPERTIES
FLWED
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
THAT
MEANS
IT
GETS
USED
TWO
LOOPS
THATS
NOT
A
DESIGN
PROBLEM
ISOLATION
FROM
AIR
AND
WATER
THAT
DOESNT
CAUSE
DESIGN
PROBLEMS
IN
COMPARISON
BWRS
A
DREAM
RIDES
PWRS
WORK
REAL
GOOD
BUT
THEY
NEED
LOTS
OF
STEEL
AND
THEY
ARE
HIGHLY
COMPLEX
SYSTEMS
SIMPLICITY
IS
A
VIRTUE
DONT
GET
NONE
OF
THAT
IN
A
LIQUID
SODIUM
BREEDER
MORE
STEEL
MORE
COMPLEXITY
