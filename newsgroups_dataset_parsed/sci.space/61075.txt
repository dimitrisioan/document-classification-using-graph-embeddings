WRITES
PAGEOS
AND
TWO
ECHO
BALLOONS
WERE
INFLATED
WITH
A
SUBSTANCE
WHICH
EXPANDED
IN
VACUUM
CALLED
GAS
ONCE
INFLATED
THE
SUBSTANCE
WAS
NO
LONGER
NEEDED
SINCE
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
CAUSE
THE
BALLOON
TO
COLLAPSE
THIS
INFLATABLE
STRUCTURE
COULD
SUFFER
MULTIPLE
HOLES
WITH
NO
DISASTROUS
DEFLATION
THE
BALLOONS
WERE
IN
SUFFICIENTLY
LOW
ORBIT
THAT
THEY
EXPERIENCED
SOME
AIR
RESISTANCE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
FINALLY
PUNCTURED
THIS
PREASURE
AND
THE
INTERNAL
PREASURE
THAT
WAS
NEEDED
TO
MAINTAIN
A
SPHERICAL
SHAPE
AGAINST

RESISTANCE
CAUSED
THEM
TO

DEFLATED
THE
LARGE
SILVERED
SHARDS
THAT
REMAINED
WERE
EASILY
VISIBLE
FOR
SOME
TIME
BEFORE
REENTRY

NO
LONGER
USEFUL
AS

BILLBOARD
SHOULD
POP
LIKE
A
