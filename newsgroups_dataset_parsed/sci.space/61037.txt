surviving
large
accelerations
hi
i
was
reading
through
the
spaceflight
handbook
and
somewhere
in
there
the
author
discusses
solar
sails
and
the
forces
acting
on
them
when
and
if
they
try
to
gain
an
initial
acceleration
by
passing
close
to
the
sun
in
a
hyperbolic
orbit
the
magnitude
of
such
accelerations
he
estimated
to
be
on
the
order
of
he
also
says
that
this
is
may
not
be
a
big
problem
for
manned
craft
because
humans
and
this
was
published
in
have
already
withstood
accelerations
of
all
this
is
very
longwinded
but
heres
my
question
finally
are
accelerations
in
fact
humanly
tolerable
with
the
aid
of
any
mechanical
devices
of
course
if
these
are
possible
what
is
used
to
absorb
the
acceleration
can
this
be
extended
to
larger
accelerations
thanks
is
advance
