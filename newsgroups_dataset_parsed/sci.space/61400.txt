touting
contributions
is

world
war
ii
produced
many
many
beneficial
spinoffs
eg
radar

rocket
technology
i
dont
think
anyone
would
argue
that
world
war
ii
was
in
and
of
itself
a
good
thing
if
you
want
people
to
back
the
space
program
it
must
be
a
good
thing
in
and
of
itself
i
disagree
with
what
to
tout
although
i
agree
that
the
space
program
is
inherently
a
good
thing
most
people
today
only
care
about
what
will
it
cost
me
and
whats
in
it
for
me
and
could
care
less
about
whether
something
is
simply
worthwhile
in
and
of
itself
our
society
has
become
increasingly
geared
toward
the
shortterm
which
you
could
read
as
now
they
couldnt
care
less
about
next
week
much
less
next
century
they
want
something
to
show
for
the
expenditure
and
they
want
it
now
i
think
we
should
tell
them
about
the
things
that
they
are
using
now
that
are
spinoffs
of
the
space
program
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
prove
its
worth
to
them
and
they
vote
and
pay
taxes
too
the
continued
existence
of
the
space
program
relies
upon
that
money
