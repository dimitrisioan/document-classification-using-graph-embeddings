plutos
atmosphere
will
start
to
freeze
out
around
and
after
about
increasing
areas
of
both
pluto
and
charon
will
be
in
permanent
shadow
that
will
make
imaging
and
geochemical
mapping
impossible
where
does
the
shadow
come
from
theres
nothing
close
enough
to
block
sunlight
from
hitting
them
i
wouldnt
expect
there
to
be
anything
block
our
view
of
them
either
what
am
i
missing
youre
assuming
that
their
normal
rotation
carries
all
areas
of
the
surface
into
sunlight
not
so
even
on
earth
each
pole
gets
several
weeks
without
sunlight
in
midwinter
pluto
and
charon
have
much
more
extreme
axial
tilt
and
a
much
longer
orbit
plutos
north
pole
for
example
gets
over
a
century
of
darkness
followed
by
over
a
century
of
perpetual
light
at
the
moment
were
in
luck
pluto
and
charon
are
just
past
their
equinox
when
the
sun
was
just
on
the
horizon
at
both
poles
of
each
if
we
get
probes
there
soon
only
the
immediate
vicinity
of
one
pole
on
each
will
be
in
longterm
shadow
this
will
get
steadily
worse
the
longer
we
wait
all
work
is
one
mans
work
