the
national
air
space
museum
has
both
the
prototype
and
the
film
however
quite
possibly
its
no
longer
on
display
nasm
like
most
museums
has
much
more
stuff
than
it
can
display
at
once
and
does
rotate
the
displays
occasionally
the
nasm
photo
archives
are
open
to
the
public
all
or
almost
all
still
pictures
in
the
collection
are
available
for
viewing
but
i
dont
know
about
films
at
least
it
might
be
worth
a
try
im
not
sure
if
appointments
are
necessary
but

think
not
good
luck
