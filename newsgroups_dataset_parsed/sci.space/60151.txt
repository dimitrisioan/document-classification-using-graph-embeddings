LAUNCHES
AINT
CHEAP
GRANTED
BUT
THATS
BECAUSE
TITAN
IVS
ARE
BOUGHT
BY
THE
GOVERNEMNT
TITAN
III
IS
ACTUALLY
THE
CHEAPEST
WAY
TO
PUT
A
POUND
IN
SPACE
OF
ALL
US
EXPENDABLE
LAUNCHERS
IN
THAT
CASE
ITS
RATHER
IRONIC
THAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
SO
POORLY
ON
THE
COMMERCIAL
MARKET
IS
THERE
A
SINGLE
TITAN
III
ON
ORDER
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
COMMERCIAL
TITAN
IS
THAT
MM
HAS
MADE
LITTLE
OR
NO
ATTEMPT
TO
MARKET
IT
THEYRE
BASICALLY
HAPPY
WITH
THEIR
GOVERNMENT
BUSINESS
AND
DONT
WANT
TO
HAVE
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
SELL
COMMERCIALLY
A
SECONDARY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
IT
IS
A
BIT
BIG
THEYD
NEED
TO
GO
AFTER
MULTISATELLITE
LAUNCHES
A
LA
ARIANE
AND
THAT
COMPLICATES
THE
MARKETING
TASK
QUITE
SIGNIFICANTLY
THEY
ALSO
HAD
SOME
PROBLEMS
WITH
LAUNCH
FACILITIES
AT
JUST
THE
WRONG
TIME
TO
GET
THEM
STARTED
PROPERLY
IF
MEMORY
SERVES
THE
PAD
USED
FOR
THE

LAUNCH
HAD
JUST
COME
OUT
OF
HEAVY
REFURBISHMENT
WORK
THAT
HAD
PREVENTED
LAUNCHES
FROM
IT
FOR
A
YEAR
OR
SO
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
A
FEW
CT

MARS
OBSERVER
WAS
ONE
OF

SO
WAS

AND
AT

OF
