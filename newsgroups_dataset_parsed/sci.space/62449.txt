were
talking
about
an
orbiting
ad
here
not
some
little
point
of
light
that
puts
a
streak
or
two
on
a
photograph
it
should
have
been
clear
that
anything
used
for
advertisement
is
going
to
be
a
bit
larger
than
a
point
source
even
if
this
was
not
clear
theres
a

there
was
a
report
of
a
group
called
space
marketing
in
atlanta
georgia
who
is
planning
to
put
up
a
one
mile
wide
reflective
earth
orbiting
satelite
which
will
appear
as
large
and
as
bright
as
the
moon
and
carry
some
sort
of
advertising
from
the
description
ive
read
its
prob
only
going
to
be
as
bright
as
jupiter
anything
else
is
probably
hype
from
the
opponents
or
wishful
thinking
from
the
sponsors
if
we
could
do
something
as
bright
as
the
full
moon
that
soon
that
cheap
the
cis
would
have
done
it
already
