background
the
orion
spacedrive
was
a
theoretical
concept
it
was
more
than
a
theoretical
concept
it
was
seriously
pursued
by
freeman
dyson
et
al
many
years
ago
i
dont
know
how
wellknown
this
is
but
a
high
explosive
orion
prototype
flew
in
the
atmosphere
in
san
diego
back
in
or
i
was
working
at
general
atomic
at
the
time
but
i
didnt
learn
about
the
experiment
until
almost
thirty
years
later
when
ted
taylor
visited
us
and
revealed
that
it
had
been
done
i
feel
sure
that
someone
must
have
film
of
that
experiment
and
id
really
like
to
see
it
has
anyone
out
there
seen
it
