usually
it

a

i
would
have
expected
a
more

role
christian
slater
only
gota
cameo
on
and
besides
maybe

pat
better
idea
for
use
of
nasa
shuttle
astronauts
and
crew
is
have
them
be
found
lost
in
space
after
a
accident
with
a
worm
hole
or
other
spacetime
glitch
maybe
age
jemison
a
few
years
makeup
and
such
and
have
her
as
the
only
survivour
of
a
failed
shuttle
mission
that
got
lost
heh
of
late
they
way
they
have
been
having
shuttle
problems
in
the
media
anything
can
happen
imagine
a
astronautcrew
member
to
find
themselves
in
the
century
as
the
object
of
interest
of
an
alien
civilization
maybe
rescued
or
helped
by
the
st
enterprise
i
know
vegr
and
such
was
okay
but
this
could
be
better
