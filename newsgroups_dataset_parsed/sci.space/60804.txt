big
amateur
rockets
i
was
reading
popular
science
this
morning
and
was
surprised
by
an
ad
in
the
back
i
know
that
a
lot
of
the
ads
in
the
back
of
ps
are
fringe
science
or
questionablely
legal
but
this
one
really
grabbed
my
attention
it
was
from
a
company
name
personal
missle
inc
or
something
like
that
anyhow
the
ad
stated
that
theyd
sell
rockets
that
were
up
to
in
length
and
engines
of
sizes
f
to
m
they
also
said
that
some
rockets
will
reach
feet
now
aside
from
the
obvious
dangers
to
any
amateur
rocketeer
using
one
of
these
beasts
isnt
this
illegal
i
cant
imagine
the
faa
allowing
people
to
shoot
rockets
up
through
the
flight
levels
of
passenger
planes
not
to
even
mention
the
problem
of
locating
a
rocket
when
it
comes
down
and
no
im
not
going
to
even
think
of
buying
one
im
not
that
crazy
