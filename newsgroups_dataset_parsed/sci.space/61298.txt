also
ask
any
electricguitar
enthusiast
which
type
of
amp
they
prefer
and
theyll
tell
you
tubetype
since
tubes
have
lower
distortion
and
noise
than
transistors
course
most
of
your
electric
guitar
types
just
say
tubes
sound
better
dude
of
course
they
then
turn
up
the
reverb
the
gain
add
in
the
analog
delay
line
and
the
fuzz
box
id
think
they
wouldnt
notice
the
distortion
oh
i
forgot
the
phase
shifters
also
transistors
have
the
advantage
in
both
wasteheat
and
energyuse
mainly
because
of
the
heaters
on
the
cathodes
of
the
tubes
ah
but
how
do
they
compare
to
mechanical
systems
