RLSUIHEPAHEPUIUCEDU
WRITES
ALLOW
IT
TO
GO
INTO
LUNAR
ORBIT
WITHOUT
LARGE
EXPENDITURES
OF
FUEL
TO
SLOW
DOWN
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
NATURAL
OBJECTS
SOMETIMES
GET
CAPTURED
WITHOUT
EXPENDING
FUEL
WELL
JUST
FIND
THE
TRAJECTORY
THAT
MAKES
IT
POSSIBLE
THE
ORIGINATOR
OF
THE
TECHNIQUE
SAID
THAT
NASA
WASNT
INTERESTED
BUT
THAT
JAPAN
WAS
BECAUSE
THEIR
PROBE
WAS
SMALL
AND
COULDNT
HOLD
A
LOT
OF
FUEL
FOR
DECELERATION
ACTUALLY
HITEN
WASNT
ORIGINALLY
INTENDED
TO
GO
INTO
LUNAR
ORBIT
AT
ALL
SO
IT
INDEED
DIDNT
HAVE
MUCH
FUEL
ON

THE

MISSION
WAS
AN
AFTERTHOUGHT
AFTER
HAGOROMO
A
TINY
SUBSATELLITE
DEPLOYED
BY
HITEN
DURING
A
LUNAR
FLYBY
HAD
A
TRANSMITTER
FAILURE
AND
ITS
PROPER
INSERTION
INTO
LUNAR
ORBIT
COULDNT
BE
POSITIVELY
CONFIRMED
IT
SHOULD
BE
NOTED
THAT
THE
TECHNIQUE
DOES
HAVE
DISADVANTAGES
IT
TAKES
A
LONG
TIME
AND
YOU
END
UP
WITH
A
RELATIVELY
INCONVENIENT
LUNAR
ORBIT
IF
YOU
WANT
SOMETHING
USEFUL
LIKE
A
LOW
CIRCULAR
POLAR
ORBIT
YOU
DO
HAVE
TO
PLAN
TO
EXPEND
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
FUEL
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
REDUCED
FROM
WHAT
