cassini
saturn
orbiter
and
titan
atmosphere
probe
cassini
is
a
joint
nasaesa
project
designed
to
accomplish
an
exploration
of
the
saturnian
system
with
its
cassini
saturn
orbiter
and
huygens
titan
probe
cassini
is
scheduled
for
launch
aboard
a
titan
ivcentaur
in
october
of
after
gravity
assists
of
venus
earth
and
jupiter
in
a
vvejga
trajectory
the
spacecraft
will
arrive
at
saturn
in
june
of
upon
arrival
the
cassini
spacecraft
performs
several
maneuvers
to
achieve
an
orbit
around
saturn
near
the
end
of
this
initial
orbit
the
huygens
probe
separates
from
the
orbiter
and
descends
through
the
atmosphere
of
titan
the
orbiter
relays
the
probe
data
to
earth
for
about
hours
while
the
probe
enters
and
traverses
the
cloudy
atmosphere
to
the
surface
after
the
completion
of
the
probe
mission
the
orbiter
continues
touring
the
saturnian
system
for
three
and
a
half
years
titan
synchronous
orbit
trajectories
will
allow
about
flybys
of
titan
and
targeted
flybys
of
iapetus
dione
and
enceladus
the
objectives
of
the
mission
are
threefold
conduct
detailed
studies
of
saturns
atmosphere
rings
and
magnetosphere
conduct
closeup
studies
of
saturns
satellites
and
characterize
titans
atmosphere
and
surface
one
of
the
most
intriguing
aspects
of
titan
is
the
possibility
that
its
surface
may
be
covered
in
part
with
lakes
of
liquid
hydrocarbons
that
result
from
photochemical
processes
in
its
upper
atmosphere
these
hydrocarbons
condense
to
form
a
global
smog
layer
and
eventually
rain
down
onto
the
surface
the
cassini
orbiter
will
use
onboard
radar
to
peer
through
titans
clouds
and
determine
if
there
is
liquid
on
the
surface
experiments
aboard
both
the
orbiter
and
the
entry
probe
will
investigate
the
chemical
processes
that
produce
this
unique
atmosphere
the
cassini
mission
is
named
for
jean
dominique
cassini
the
first
director
of
the
paris
observatory
who
discovered
several
of
saturns
satellites
and
the
major
division
in
its
rings
the
titan
atmospheric
entry
probe
is
named
for
the
dutch
physicist
christiaan
huygens
who
discovered
titan
and
first
described
the
true
nature
of
