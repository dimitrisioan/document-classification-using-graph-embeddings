WRITES
IF
REBOOSTING
THE
HST
BY
CARRYING
IT
WITH
A
SHUTTLE
WOULD
NOT
DAMAGE
IT
THEN
WHY
COULDNT
HST
BE
BROUGHT
BACK
TO
EARTH
AND
THE
REPAIR
JOB
DONE
HERE
REBOOST
MAY
NOT
BE
A
PROBLEM
IF
THEY
HAVE
ENOUGH
FUEL
IF
THEY
DONT
DO
A
REBOOST
THIS
TIME
THEY
WILL
DEFINITELY
HAVE
TO
DO
ONE
ON
THE
NEXT
SERVICING
MISSION
BUT
TRY
TO
LAND
A
SHUTTLE
WITH
THAT
BIG
HUGE
TELESCOPE
IN
THE
BACK
AND
YOU
COULD
HAVE
PROBLEMS
THE
SHUTTLE
JUST
ISNT
DESIGNED
TO
LAND
WITH
THAT
MUCH
WEIGHT
IN
THE
PAYLOAD
IS
IT
BECAUSE
TWO
SHUTTLE
FLIGHTS
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
ADDING
TO
THE
ALREDY
HORRENDOUS
EXPENSE
OF
COURSE
THAT
IS
A
CONCERN
TOO
AND
THE
LOSS
OF
SCIENCE
DURING
THE
TIME
THAT
IT
IS
ON
THE
GROUND
PLUS
A
FEAR
THAT
IF
IT
COMES
DOWN
SOME
BIGWIG
MIGHT
NOT
ALLOW
IT
TO
GO
BACK
UP
BUT
THE
MAIN
CONCERN
I
BELIEVE
IS
THE
DANGER
OF
THE
LANDING
JUST
TO
ADD
ANOTHER
BAD
VIBE
THEY
ALSO
INCREASE
THE
RISK
OF
DAMAGING
AN
INSTRUMENT
FINALLY
THIS
IS
A
CHANCE
FOR
NASA
ASTRONANUTS
TO
PROVE
THEY
COULD
BUILD
AND
SERVICE
A
SPACE
STATION
HUBBLE
WAS
DESIGNED
FOR
IN
FLIGHT
SERVICING
BRINGING
THE
TELESCOPE
DOWN
TO
MY
UNDERSTANDING
WAS
CONSIDERED
EVEN
VERY
RECENTLY
BUT
ALL
THESE
FACTORS
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THE
DECISION
TO
DO
IT
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
PLANNED
IN
THE
BEGINNING
