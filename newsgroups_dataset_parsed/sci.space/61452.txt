MOORE
WRITES
AS
HERNY
POINTED
OUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
DEVELOP
THE
THRUSTER
ALSO
WHILE
MUCH
LIGHTER
YOU
STILL
HAVE
TO
LIFT
THE
MASS
OF
THE
THRUSTER
TO
ORBIT
AND
THEN
THE
THRUSTER
LIFTS
ITS
OWN
WEIGHT
INTO
A
HIGHER
ORBIT
AND
YOU
TAKE
UP
ROOM
IN
THE
PAYLOAD
BAY
A
YES
BUT
THE
IMPROVEMENT
IN
BOOST
ORBIT
TO
THE
HST
IS
SIGNIFICANT
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
HERE
WHAT
IS
IMPROVED
WHAT
IS
SIGNIFICANT
AND
WHAT
DOES
THIS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
CARRYING
MORE
EQUIPMENT
ON
A
SERVICING
MISSION
ALSO
AS
IMPLIED
BY
OTHER
POSTERS
WHY
DO
YOU
NEED
TO
BOOST
THE
ORBIT
ON
THIS
MISSION
ANYWAY
MAYBE
YOU
HAVE
SOMETHING
HERE
BUT
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
CLARIFY
IT
FOR
US
ON
THE
NET
AND
THAT
MEANS
YOU
CAN
THEN
CARRY
EDO
PACKS
AND
ENOUGH
CONSUMABLES
SO
THE
SHUTTLE
MISSION
CAN
GO
ON
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
ALSO
FIX
THE
ARRAY
TILT
MOTORS
AND
GOD
KNOWS
WHAT
ELSE
IS
GOING
TO
WEAR
OUT
FROM
WHAT
IVE
HEARD
THE
MOTORS
ARE
FINE
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
SETS
OF
ELECTRONICS
THAT
CONTROL
THE
MOTORS
THAT
NEEDS
A
FIX
THE
MOTORS
AND
ELECTRONICS
ARE
SEPARATE
PIECES
OF
HARDWARE
I
EXPECT
TO
BE
CORRECTED
IF
IM
WRONG
ON
THIS
ON
THE
HST
IN
THE
NEXT
MONTHS
