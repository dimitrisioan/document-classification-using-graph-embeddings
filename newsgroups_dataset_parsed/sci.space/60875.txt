this
was
known
as
journey
to
the
far
side
of
the
sun
in
the
united
states
and
as
doppelganger
in
the
uk
later
they
went
on
to
do
more
liveaction
sf
series
ufo
and
space
the
astronomy
was
lousy
but
the
liftingbody
spacecraft
vtol
airliners
and
mighty
portugese
launch
complex
were
wonderful
to
look
at
exactly
some
of
the
effects
remain
firstrate
even
today
they
recycled
a
lot
of
models
and
theme
music
for
ufo
some
of
the
concepts
even
showed
up
in
space
later
on
the
andersons
tried
to
shed
their
reputation
as
creators
of
some
of
the
worst
pseudoscientific
shows
in
tv
history
by
flying
into
infinity
this
was
a
oneoff
thing
done
as
part
of
bbcs
educational
sf
series
the
day
after
tomorrow
the
anderson
episode
dealt
with
a
spaceship
capable
of
reaching
the
speed
of
light
lightship
altares
the
fourman
crew
eventually
journeyed
into
a
black
hole
and
ended
up
on
the
far
side
of
the
galaxy
i
think
i
saw
this
as
a
back
in
and
liked
it
very
much
but
then
again
i
was
a
fan
of
so
i
guess
i
was
easily
satisfied
in
those
days

know
if
into
infinity

been
released
