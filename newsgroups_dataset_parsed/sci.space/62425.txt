it
is

now
somewhat
of
an

science
with
the

fractals
strange

whether
important
insights
will
be
gained
from
these

is
unknown

it
does
tend
to
change
the
shape

what
has

been
viewed
as
an

how
do
you
do
experiments
in
mathematics
nowadays
usually

no

listed

no
one
can
yet
write
an
algorithm
that
will
predict
the
precise

of
any
of
these
at
any

of

so
it
remains
for
experimenters
to

data
on
their
