CLOUDY
THE
SDI
ORGANIZATION
WHICH
PAID
MILLION
FOR
THE
DCX
CANT
ITSELF
AFFORD
TO
FUND
FULL
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
FOLLOWON
VEHICLE
TO
GET
THE
NECESSARY
HUNDREDS
OF
MILLIONS
REQUIRED
FOR
THIS
IS
A
LITTLE
PECULIAR
WAY
OF
PUTTING
IT
SDIOS
BUDGET
THIS
YEAR
WAS
WHAT
BILLION
THEY
COULD
FUND
ALL
OF
THE
DC
DEVELOPMENT
OUT
OF
ONE
YEARS
BUDGET
OF
COURSE
THEY
DO
HAVE
OTHER
IRONS
IN
THE
FIRE
AND
LAUNCHER
DEVELOPMENT
IS
NOT
THEIR
PRIMARY
PURPOSE
BUT
THE
DC
DEVELOPMENT
COULD
AS
EASILY
BE
PAID
FOR
BY
DIVERTING
THAT
MONEY
AS
BY
DIVERTING
THE
COMPARABLE
STS
OPS
BUDGET
OH
AND
BEFORE
THE
FLAMES
START
I
APPLAUD
THE
SDIO
FOR
FUNDING
DCX
DEVLOPMENT
AND
I
HOPE
IT
WORKS
AND
NO
LAUNCHER
DEVELOPMENT
IS
NOT
NASAS
PRIMARY
GOAL
EITHER
IMHO
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
PROVIDE
THE
ENABLING
TECHNOLOGY
RESEARCH
FOR
OTHERS
TO
DO
LAUNCHER
DEVELOPMENT
AND
SECONDARILY
OPERATE
SUCH
LAUNCHERS
AS
THEY
REQUIRE
BUT
THATS
JUST
