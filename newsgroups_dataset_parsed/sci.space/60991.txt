I
HEAR
INSERT
FAVORITE
RUMOR
HERE
THAT
IT
WILL
SUPPOSEDLY
COINCIDE
WITH
THE
ATLANTA
OLYMPICS
EVEN
WORSE
THE
CITY
OF
ATLANTA
HAS
A
PROPOSAL
BEFORE
IT
TO
RENT
SPACE
ON
THIS
ORBITING
BILLBOARD
CONSIDERING
THE
CALIBER
OF
PEOPLE
RUNNING
THIS
CITY
THERES
NO
TELLING
WHAT
WERE
GOING
TO
HAVE
LEERING
DOWN
AT
US
FROM
ORBIT
I
WOULD
JUST
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
IS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
PLACE
AN
OBJECT
AT
ORBITAL
ALTITUDE
THAN
IT
IS
TO
PLACE
IT
WITH
ORBITAL
VELOCITY
FOR
A
TARGET
KM
ABOVE
THE
SURFACE
OF
EARTH
YOU
NEED
A
DELTAV
OF
KMS
ASSUMING
THAT
ROCKETS
WITH
SPECIFIC
IMPULSES
OF
SECONDS
ARE
EASY
TO
PRODUCE
A
ROCKET
WITH
A
DRY
WEIGHT
OF
KG
WOULD
REQUIRE
ONLY
ABOUT
KG
OF
FUELOXIDIZER
A
SMALL
DISPERSAL
CHARGE
EMBEDDED
IN
ABOUT
KG
OF
SAND
OR
BIRDSHOT
DEPENDING
ON
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
WOULD
BE
THE
PAYLOAD
I
AM
SURE
THE
WHOLE
PROJECT
IS
WELL
WITHIN
THE
CAPABILITY
OF
THE
AMATEUR
ROCKETRY
COMMUNITY
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
GOOD
SCIENCE
FAIR
PROJECTREDUCTION
OF
LIGHT
POLLUTION
THROUGH
APPLIED
BALLISTICS
OR
IT
COULD
BE
PART
OF
THE
CHALLENGE
PRIZE
BEING
DISCUSSED
HERE
BILLION
FOR
THE
FIRST
PERSON
TO
SPEND
YEAR
ON
THE
MOON
MILLION
FOR
THE
FIRST
ERRADICATION
OF
AN
ORBITAL
EYESORECCD
BURNER
I
WOULDPLEDGE
FOR
THE
FIRST
PERSON
TO
BRING
IT
DOWN
AND
I
AM
SURE
THERE
ARE
AT
LEAST
OTHER
ASTRONOMERS
NATURE
LOVERS
OR
JUST
PLAIN
PEOPLE
OF
GOOD
TASTE
WHO
WOULD
DO
LIKEWISE
OF
COURSE
A
GERALD
BULL
SOLUTION
MIGHT
BE
SIMPLER
EITHER
THE
SOLUTION
GERALD
BULL
WOULD
APPLYTHE
USE
OF
A
LARGE
CALIBER

OR
THE
SOLUTION
WHICH
WAS
APPLIED
TO

USE
