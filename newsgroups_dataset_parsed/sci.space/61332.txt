MOST

LARSON
WAS
A
RETIRED
ENGINEER
WITH
A
BACHELOR
OF
SCIENCE
DEGREE
IN
ENGINEERING
SCIENCE
FROM
OREGON
STATE
UNIVERSITY
HE
DEVELOPED
THE
THEORY
DESCRIBED
IN
HIS
BOOKS
WHILE
TRYING
TO
FIND
A
WAY
TO
MATHEMATICALLY
CALCULATE
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
CHEMICAL
COMPOUNDS
BASED
ONLY
ON
THE

THEY
CONTAIN
THE
UNIVERSE
OF

DESCRIBES
THE
ASTROPHYSICAL
PORTIONS
OF
LARSONS
CONSISTENT
INTEGRATED
COMPREHENSIVE
GENERAL
UNIFIED
THEORY
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
A
KIND
OF
GRAND
UNIFIED
FIELD
THEORY
THAT
ORTHODOX
PHYSICISTS
AND
ASTROPHYSICISTS
CLAIM
TO
BE
LOOKING
FOR
IT
IS
BUILT
ON
TWO
POSTULATES
ABOUT
THE
PHYSICAL
AND
MATHEMATICAL
NATURE
OF
SPACE
AND
TIME
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
IS
COMPOSED
ENTIRELY
OF
ONE
COMPONENT
MOTION
EXISTING
IN
THREE
DIMENSIONS
IN
DISCRETE
UNITS
AND
WITH
TWO
RECIPROCAL
ASPECTS
SPACE
AND
TIME
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
CONFORMS
TO
THE
RELATIONS
OF
ORDINARY
COMMUTATIVE
MATHEMATICS
ITS
PRIMARY
MAGNITUDES
ARE
ABSOLUTE
AND
ITS
GEOMETRY
IS
EUCLIDEAN
FROM
THESE
TWO
POSTULATES
LARSON
WAS
ABLE
TO
BUILD
A
COMPLETE
THEORETICAL
UNIVERSE
FROM
PHOTONS
AND
SUBATOMIC
PARTICLES
TO
THE
GIANT
ELLIPTICAL
GALAXIES
BY
COMBINING
THE
CONCEPT
OF
INWARD
AND
OUTWARD
SCALAR
MOTIONS
WITH
TRANSLATIONAL
VIBRATIONAL
ROTATIONAL
AND
ROTATIONAL
VIBRATIONAL
MOTIONS
AT
EACH
STEP
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
MATCH
PARTS
OF
HIS
THEORETICAL
UNIVERSE
WITH
CORRESPONDING
PARTS
IN
THE
REAL
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
INCLUDING
EVEN
THINGS
NOT
YET
DISCOVERED
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
HIS
BOOK
HE
FIRST
PREDICTED
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
EXPLODING
GALAXIES
SEVERAL
YEARS
BEFORE
ASTRONOMERS
STARTED
FINDING
THEM
THEY
ARE
A
NECESSARY
CONSEQUENCE
OF
HIS
COMPREHENSIVE
THEORY
AND
WHEN
QUASARS
WERE
DISCOVERED
HE
HAD
A
RELATED
EXPLANATION
READY
FOR
THOSE
ALSO
AS
A
RESULT
OF
HIS
THEORY
WHICH
HE
CALLED
THE
RECIPROCAL
SYSTEM
LARSON
TOTALLY
REJECTED
MANY
OF
THE
SACRED
DOCTRINES
OF
ORTHODOX
PHYSICISTS
AND

AND
THE

ALL
OF
WHICH
HE
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
MATHEMATICAL

WAS
VERY
CRITICAL

NO

DECLARATIONS
ETC
USED
TO
MAINTAIN
THEM
THE
UNIVERSE
OF

IS
DIVIDED
INTO
CHAPTERS
IT
BEGINS
WITH
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
HOW
GALAXIES
ARE
BUILT
FROM
THE
GRAVITATIONAL
ATTRACTION
BETWEEN
GLOBULAR
STAR
CLUSTERS
WHICH
ARE
FORMED
FROM
INTERGALACTIC
GAS
AND
DUST
CLOUDS
THAT
ACCUMULATE
FROM
THE
DECAY

OF

RAYS
COMING
IN
FROM
THE
ANTIMATTER
HALF
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
GALAXY
FORMATION
FROM
THE
MYTHICAL
BIG
BANG
IS
A
BIG
MYSTERY
TO
ORTHODOX
ASTRONOMERS
HE
THEN
GOES
ON
TO
DESCRIBE
LIFE
CYCLES
OF
STARS
AND
HOW
BINARY
AND
MULTIPLE
STAR
SYSTEMS
AND
SOLAR
SYSTEMS
RESULT
FROM
TYPE

SUPERNOVA
EXPLOSIONS
OF
SINGLE
STARS
SEVERAL
CHAPTERS
ARE
DEVOTED
TO
QUASARS
WHICH
ACCORDING
TO
LARSON
ARE
DENSELYPACKED
CLUSTERS
OF
STARS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
EJECTED
FROM
THE
CENTRAL
BULGES
OF
EXPLODING
GALAXIES
AND
ARE
ACTUALLY
TRAVELING
FASTER
THAN
THE
SPEED
OF
LIGHT
ALTHOUGH
MOST
OF
THAT
SPEED
IS
AWAY
FROM
US
IN
TIME
ASTRONOMERS
AND
ASTROPHYSICISTS
WHO
RUN
UP
AGAINST
OBSERVATIONS
THAT
CONTRADICT
THEIR
THEORIES
WOULD
FIND
LARSONS
EXPLANATIONS
QUITE
VALUABLE
IF
CONSIDERED
WITH
AN
OPEN
MIND
FOR
EXAMPLE
THEY
USED
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTS
ORIGINATED
FROM
PULSARS
WHICH
EXIST
PRIMARILY
IN
THE
PLANE
OR
CENTRAL
BULGE
OF
OUR
GALAXY
BUT
THE
NEW
GAMMA
RAY
TELESCOPE
IN
EARTH
ORBIT
OBSERVED
THAT
THE
BURSTS
COME
FROM
ALL
DIRECTIONS
UNIFORMLY
AND
DO
NOT
CORRESPOND
WITH
ANY
VISIBLE
OBJECTS
EXCEPT
FOR
A
FEW
CASES
OF
DIRECTIONAL
COINCIDENCE
LARSONS
EXPLANATION
IS
THAT
THE
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTS
ORIGINATE
FROM
SUPERNOVA
EXPLOSIONS
IN
THE
ANTIMATTER
HALF
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
WHICH
LARSON
CALLS
THE
COSMIC
SECTOR
BECAUSE
THE
ANTIMATTER
UNIVERSE
EXISTS
IN
A
RECIPROCAL
RELATION
TO
OUR
MATERIAL
UNIVERSE
WITH
THE
SPEED
OF
LIGHT
AS
THE
BOUNDARY
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
HAS
THREE
DIMENSIONS
OF
