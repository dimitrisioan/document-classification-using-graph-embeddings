design
a
mother
ship
that
has
piggy
backed
probes
for
different
missionsnamely
different
planets
not
useful
unless
youve
got
some
truly
wonderful
propulsion
system
for
the
mother
ship
that
cant
be
applied
to
the
probes
otherwise
its
better
to
simply
launch
the
probes
independently
the
outer
planets
are
scattered
widely
across
a
twodimensional
solar
system
and
going
to
one
is
seldom
helpful
in
going
to
the
next
one
uranus
is
not
on
the
way
to
neptune
dont
judge
interplanetary
trajectories
in
general
by
what
the
voyagers
did
they
exploited
a
lineup
that
occurs
only
every
couple
of
centuries
and
even
so
voyager
took
a
rather
indirect
route
to
neptune
also
the
mother
ship
would
be
powered
if
not
the
mars
mission
by
a
normal
propulsion
but
also
a
solar
sail
solar
sails
are
pretty
useless
in
the
outer
solar
system
theyre
also
very
slow
unless
you
assume
quite
advanced
versions
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
