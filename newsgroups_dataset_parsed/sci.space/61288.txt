what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
david
gives
good
explaination
of
the
deductions
from
the
isotropic
edged
distribution
to
whit
they
are
either
part
of
the
universe
or
part
of
the
oort
cloud
why
couldnt
they
be
earth
centred
with
the
edge
occuring
at
the
edge
of
the
gravisphere
i
know
there
isnt
any
mechanism
for
them
but
there
isnt
a
mechanism
for
the
others
either
