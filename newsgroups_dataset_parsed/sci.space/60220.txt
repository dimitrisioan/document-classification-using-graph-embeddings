does
anyone
have
any
info
on
the
apparent
sightings
of
vulcan
all
that
i
know
is
that
there
were
apparently
two
sightings
at
drastically
different
times
of
a
small
planet
that
was
inside
mercurys
orbit
beyond
that
i
have
no
other
info
the
sightings
were
apparently
spurious
there
is
no
planet
inside
of
the
orbit
of
mercury
the
idea
of
vulcan
came
from
the
differences
between
mercurys
observed
perihelion
precession
and
the
value
it
should
have
had
according
to
newtonian
physics
leverrier
made
an
extensive
set
of
observations
and
calculations
during
the
mid
century
and
simon
newcombe
later
improved
on
the
observations
and
recalculated
using
leverriers
system
of
equations
now
leverrier
was
one
of
the
codiscoverers
of
neptune
and
since
he
had
predicted
its
existence
based
on
anomalies
in
the
orbit
of
uranus
his
inclination
was
to
believe
the
same
sort
of
thing
was
afoot
with
mercury
but
alas
twere
not
so
mercurys
perihelion
precesses
at
the
rate
it
does
because
the
space
where
it
resides
near
the
sun
is
significantly
curved
due
to
the
suns
mass
this
explanation
had
to
wait
until
and
albert
einsteins
synthesis
of
his
earlier
theory
of
the
electrodynamics
of
moving
bodies
commonly
called
special
relativity
with
reimanian
geometry
the
result
was
the
general
theory
of
relativity
and
one
of
its
most
noteworthy
strengths
is
that
it
accounts
for
the
precession
of
mercurys
perihelion
almost
exactly
exactly
if
you
use
newcombs
numbers
rather
than
leverriers
of
course
not
everybody
believes
einstein
and
thats
fine
but
subsequent
efforts
to
find
any
planets
closer
to
the
sun
than
mercury
using
radar
have
been
fruitless
