mothership
for
flybys

okay
we
have
figure
out
that
a
mission
specifically
to
pluto
is
to
large
and
to
expensive
id
hardly
call
the
current
pluto
fast
flyby
proposal
too
large
if
the
new
technology
insertion
currently
taking
place
succeeds
the
sc
mass
will
drop
to
kg
or
too
expensive
million
for
two
sc
especially
when
compared
to
other
nasa
planetary
missions
basically
what
i
mean
is
design
a
mother
ship
that
has
piggy
backed
probes
for
different
missionsnamely
different
planets
each
probe
would
be
tied
in
with
the
mother
ship
or
earth
as
the
case
may
be
this
is
good
when
and
if
we
go
for
mars
the
mars
mission
can
act
as
either
mother
ship
or
relay
point
for
the
probes
this
proposal
would
work
only
if
your
various
targets
are
relaively
nearby
and
the
require
minimal
deltav
from
the
mother
ship
a
mission
to
the
main
belt
might
be
one
possibility
for
such
a
mission
i
recall
a
paper
being
presented
at
an
aiaa
deisgn
conference
in
irvine
in
february
where
such
a
proposed
spacecraft
was
designed
by
some
grad
students
at
ut
austin
i
think
four
minispacecraft
would
detatch
from
the
main
sc
each
visiting
a
seperate
asteroid
and
then
returning
to
the
main
sc
after
analysis
the
main
sc
would
then
be
targeted
for
the
most
interesting
object
for
further
study
now
if
i
could
only
find
that
paper
jeff
foust

historical
analogy
is
the
