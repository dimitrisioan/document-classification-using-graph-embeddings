re
big
amateur
rockets
actually
they
are
legal
i
not
familiar
with
the
ad
you
are
speaking
of
but
knowing
popular
science
it
is
probably
on
the
fringe
however
you
may
be
speaking
of
public
missle
inc
which
is
a
legitimate
company
that
has
been
around
for
a
while
due
to
advances
in
composite
fuels
engines
are
now
available
for
model
rockets
using
similar
composites
to
srb
fuel
roughly
times
more
powerful
than
black
powder
motors
they
are
even
available
in
a
reloadable
form
ie
aluminum
casing
end
casings
orings
the
engines
range
from
d
all
the
way
to
m
in
common
manufacture
n
and
o
ive
heard
of
used
at
special
occasions
to
be
a
model
rocket
however
the
rocket
cant
contain
any
metal
structural
parts
amongst
other
requirements
ive
never
heard
of
a
model
rocket
doing
i
have
heard
of
foot
flights
these
require
faa
waivers
of
course
there
are
a
few
large
national
launches
ldrs
fireballs
at
which
you
can
see
many
k
sized
engine
flights
actually
using
a
g
engine
constitutes
the
area
of
high
power
rocketry
which
is
seperate
from
normal
model
rocketry
purchase
of
engines
like
i
have
been
describing
require
membership
in
the
national
association
of
rocketry
the
tripoli
rocketry
assoc
or
you
have
to
be
part
of
an
educational
institute
or
company
involved
in
rocketry
amatuer
rocketry
is
another
area
im
not
really
familiar
with
this
but
it
is
an
area
where
metal
parts
are
allowed
along
with
liquid
fuels
and
what
not
i
dont
know
what
kind
of
regulations
are
involved
but
im
sure
they
are
numerous
high
power
rocketry
is
very
exciting
if
you
are
interested
or
have
more
questions
there
is
a
newsgroup
