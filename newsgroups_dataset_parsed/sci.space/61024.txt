why
do
spacecraft
have
to
be
shut
off
after
funding
cuts
for
example
why
couldnt
magellan
just
be
told
to
go
into
a
safe
mode
and
stay
bobbing
about
venus
in
a
lowpoweruse
mode
and
if
maybe
in
a
few
years
if
funding
gets
restored
after
the
economy
gets
better
hopefully
it
could
be
turned
on
again
it
can
be
but
the
problem
is
a
political
one
not
a
technical
one
also
remember
that
every
dollar
spent
keeping
one
spacecraft
in
safe
mode
probably
a
spinstabilized
sunpointing
orientation
is
a
dollar
not
spent
on
mission
analysis
for
a
newer
spacecraft
in
order
to
turn
the
spacecraft
back
on
you
either
need
to
insure
that
the
ops
guys
will
be
available
or
you
need
to
retrain
a
new
team
having
said
that
there
are
some
spacecraft
that
do
what
you
have
proposed
many
of
the
operational
satellites
goddard
flies
like
the
tiros
noaa
series
require
more
than
one
satellite
in
orbit
for
an
operational
set
extras
which
get
replaced
onorbit
are
powered
into
a
standby
mode
for
use
in
an
emergency
in
that
case
however
the
same
ops
team
is
still
required
to
fly
the
operational
birds
so
the
standby
maintenance
is
relatively
cheap
finally
pats
explanation
some
spacecraft
require
continuous
maintenance
to
stay
under
control
is
also
right
on
the
mark
i
suggested
a
spin
stabilized
control
mode
because
it
would
require
little
power
or
maintenance
but
it
still
might
require
some
momentum
dumping
from
time
to
time
in
the
end
it
is
a
political
decision
since
the
difference
is
money
but
there
is
some
technical
rationale
behind
the
decision
