COMMENTS
ID
LIKE
TO
ADD
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
PROTESTS
DO
NOT
COME
FROM
A
STRICTLY
PRACTICAL
CONSIDERATION
OF
WHAT
POLLUTION
LEVELS
ARE
ACCEPTABLE
FOR
RESEARCH
ACTIVITIES
BY
PROFESSIONAL
ASTRONOMERS
SOME
OF
WHAT
I
WOULD
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
IS
ROOTED
IN
AESTHETICS
MANY
READERS
MAY
NEVER
HAVE
KNOWN
A
TIME
WHERE
THE
HEAVENS
WERE
PRISTINE
SACRED
UNSULLIED
BY
THE
ACTIONS
OF
HUMANS
THE
SPACE
BETWEEN
THE
STARS
AS
PROFOUNDLY
BLACK
AS
AN
ABYSS
CAN
BE
WITH
FULL
HORIZONS
AND
A
PURE
SKY
ONE
COULD
LOOK
OUT
UPON
HALF
OF
ALL
CREATION
AT
A
TIME
NONE
OF
WHICH
HAD
ANY
CONNECTION
WITH
THE
PETTY
MATTERS
OF
MAN
ANY
LIGHTS
WERE
SUPPLIED
SOLELY
BY
NATURE
UNCORRUPTABLE
BY
MEN
WHOLE
RELIGIONS
WERE
BASED
ON
MORTAL
MAN
SOMEHOW
GETTING
UP
THERE
AND
BECOMING
IMMORTAL
AS
THE
STARS
WHETHER
BY
APOTHEOSIS
OR
A
BELIEF
IN
AN
AFTERLIFE
THE
SPACE
AGE
CHANGED
ALL
THAT
MORE
ON
MANS
EFFECT
ON
THE
ENVIRONMENT
BUT
THERE
IS
STILL
THIS
DESIRE
TO
SEE
A
PLACE
THAT
MAN
HASNT
FOULED
IN
SOME
WAY
I
THINK
MY
POINT
ABOUT
A
DESIRE
FOR
BEAUTY
IS
VALID
EVEN
IF
IT
CANT
EVER
BE
PERFECTLY
ACHIEVED
I
AGREE
THAT
THE
DESIRE
FOR
BEAUTY
IS
VALID
BUT
I
THINK
YOUR
DESIRE
TO
IMPOSE
YOUR
VISION
OF
BEAUTY
IS
NOT
YOU
MENTION
THE
AGEOLD
DESIRE
TO
SOMEHOW
GET
UP
THERE
BUT
IGNORE
THE
BEAUTY
OF
THE
ACTUAL
ACHIEVMENT
OF
THAT
VISION
YOU
MENTION
THE
BEAUTY
OF
A
VERY
DARK
SKY
NOT
IMPEDED
BY
THE
EFFECTS
OF
HUMANS
BUT
IGNORE
THE
BEAUTY
OF
THE
ASDARKASCANBE
SKY
THAT
IS
ONLY
VISIBLE
FROM
SPACE
A
VISION
THAT
WE
OR
AT
LEAST
OUR
DESCENDENTS
MAY
ONE
DAY
BE
ABLE
TO
SEE
IN
PART
BECAUSE
OF
EFFORTS
THAT
OTHERS
CALL
UGLY
ONE
DAY
I
HOPE
HUMANS
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
LOOK
OUT
NOT
UPON
HALF
THE
HEAVENS
WITH
ONLY
NATURECRETED
LIGHTS
BUT
UPON
ALL
OF
THE
HEAVENS
WITH
NO
LIGHTS
IF
ADVERTISING
IN
SPACE
CAN
HELP
US
REACH
THAT
GOAL
IT
IS
NO
LESS
BEAUTIFUL
FOR
THE
WAY
WE
REACH
IT
THAN
THE
PRISTINE
SKY
OF
YESTERYEAR
OR
YESTERCENTURY
WHICH
IS
TOTALLY
UNREACHABLE
ONE
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
CONCEPTIONS
OF
BEAUTY
IN
WETSERN
SCULPTURE
WAS
A
HUMAN
FORM
IN
THE
EFFORT
OF
STRIVING
TO
REACH
A
GOAL
I
DONT
THINK
THERES
ANY
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
MODERNITY
HAS
CHANGED
THAT
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
CHANGED
THE
WAY
WE
STRIVE
BTW
THERE
ARE
PLACES
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVENT
FOULED
SOMETIMES
THEY
MAKE
IT
BETTER
