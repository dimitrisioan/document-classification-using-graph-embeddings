tsniimach
enterprise
is
described
as
a
exmilitary
establishment
they
are
located
near
the
npo
energia
facility
in
kaliningrad
outside
of
moscow
if
this
facility
is
in
kaliningrad
this
is
not
near
moscow
it
is
in
fact
the
exeast
prussian
konigsberg
now
a
russian
enclave
on
the
baltic
coast
it
is
served
by
ships
and
rail
and
the
intrepid
traveller
in
europe
would
find
it
accessible
and
might
even
want
to
try
to
arrange
a
tour
hmm
there
must
be
two
towns
with
the
same
name
kaliningrad
located
just
north
of
moscow
is
correct
it
is
the
home
of
several
russian
space
enterprises
including
npo
energia
krunichev
fakel
and
tsniimach
the
main
russian
manned
spacecraft
control
facility
is
also
located
here
kaliningrad
is
easily
reachable
by
auto
from
moscow
and
tours
can
be
arranged
call
ahead
though
there
are
still
armed
military
guards
at
many
of
these
facilities
who
dont
speak
english
arent
well
paid
and
are
rather
bored
its
a
very
popular
destination
with
western
space
industry
types
