WRITES
IN
RESPONSE
TO
MY
ORIGINAL
POST
FIRST
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
THE
LITERATURE
SEARCH
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
INFORMATION
OUT
THERE
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
JUST
PICK
A
SPECIFIC
AREA
OF
LONG
TERM
HABITATION
THIS
COULD
BE
USEFUL
ESPECIALLY
IF
WE
MAKE
IT
AVAILABLE
ON
THE
NET
THEN
WE
CAN
LOOK
AT
METHODS
OF
ANALYZING
THE
TECHNOLOGIES
SUCH
A
DETAILED
LITERATURE
SEARCH
WOULD
BE
OF
INTEREST
TO
OURSELVES
AS
SPACE
ADVOCATES
AND
CLEARLY
IMPORTANT
TO
EXISTING
SPACE
PROGRAMS
IN
ESSENCE
WE
WOULD
BE
DIVIDING
THE
SPACE
LIFE
SCIENCE
ISSUES
INTO
VARIOUS
TECHNICAL
PROBLEMS
WHICH
COULD
BE
SOLVED
WITH
VARIOUS
TECHNOLOGIES
THIS
DATABASE
OF
ACCEPTABLE
SOLUTIONS
TO
VARIOUS
PROBLEMS
COULD
FORM
THE
BASIS
OF
DETAILED
DISCUSSIONS
INVOLVING
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
BIONET
ISUNET
AND
ANY
OTHER
SOURCE
UNLESS
THERE
IS
AN
UNBELIEVABLE
OUTPOURING
OF
INTEREST
ON
THIS
ON
THE
NET
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
DEVELOP
A
DETAILED
DATA
BASE
OF
THE
LITERATURE
SEARCH
FIRST
THEN
IF
WE
ACCOMPLISH
THAT
WE
CAN
GO
ON
TO
REAL
ANALYSIS
THE
DATA
BASE
ITSELF
COULD
BE
USEFUL
FOR
FUTURE
ENGINEERS
THATS
MY
RESPONSE
KEN
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
TIM
WELL
I
AGREE
I
HOPE
OTHERS
CHIME
IN
WITH
SUGGESTIONS
ON
SPECIFIC
TECHNOLOGIES
WHICH
COULD
BE
APPLIED
TOWARDS
THE
MAINTENANCE
OF
AN
EARTH
LIKE
ATMOSPHERE
ON
A
LONGDURATION
SPACECRAFT
TIM
ET
AL
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
TRY
LOOKING
AT
ATMOSPHERE
FIRST
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
SINGLE
MOST
FUNDAMENTAL
ISSUE
IN
KEEPING
ANYONE
ALIVE
WERE
ALL
TAUGHT
THAT
WHEN
SUPPORTING
A
PATIENT
YOU
LOOK
FOR
MAINTAINING
AIRWAY
SO
IN
KEEPING
WITH
MY
TRAUMA
TRAINING
AND
KEEPING
MY
EMERGENCY
MEDICINE
PROFESSOR
HAPPY
I
SUGGEST
THAT
WE
LOOK
AT
THE
ISSUES
SURROUNDING
A
REGENERABLE
ATMOSPHERIC
CIRCUIT
HOWZ
THAT
TIM
KEN
