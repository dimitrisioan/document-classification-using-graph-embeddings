FRED

MCCALL
WRITES
HMMM
NOT
SURE
WHATS
REQUIRED
FOR
SHIPS
PROBABLY
NOT
MUCH
SINCE
IF
A
SHIP
GOES
DOWN
IT
DOESNT
HURT
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
OTHER
THAN
THOSE
ON
THE
SHIP
AND
THOSE
WHO
INVESTED
IN
IT
IF
A
PLANE
OR
SPACECRAFT
GOES
DOWN
IT
CAN
MAKE
QUITE
A
NASTY
MESS
ON
THE
GROUND
SHOULD
IT
LAND
IN
AN
INAPPROPRIATE
PLACE
CONSIDERING
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
LOSS
OF
LIFE
IN
BOTH
THE
MORO
CASTLE
AND
TITANIC
DISASTERS
I
CANT
BELIEVE
YOU
CAN
BE
SO
BLITHE
THERE
FRED
BESIDES
IF
A
LNG
TANKER
BREAKS
UP
IN
A
CLOSE
HARBOR
YOU
CAN
KISS
OFF
QUITE
A
LOT
OF
POPULATION
SAME
THING
FOR
ANY
CHEMICAL
TANKERS
I
KNOW
THE
COAST
GUARD
MAKES
MANDATORY
SAFETY
EQUIPMENT
CHECKS
ON
ALL
WATERCRAFT
THEY
USE
THIS
AS
AN
EXCUSE
TO
MAKE
NARCOTICS
SEARCHES
WITHOUT
WARRANTS
I
SUSPECT
THAT
COMMERCIAL
CRAFT
NEED
A
CERTIFICATE
AT
LEAST
SIMILIAR
IN
SCOPE
TO
AN
AIR
WORTHINESS
CERTIFICATE
FROM
THE
DOT
PAT
