THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOMETHING
BOTHERING
ME
WHILE
WATCHING
NASA
SELECT
FOR
A
WHILE
WELL
I
SHOULDNT
SAY
BOTHERING
MAYBE
WONDERING
WOULD
BE
BETTER
WHEN
THEY
ARE
GOING
TO
LAUNCH
THEY
SAY
SORRY
BUT
I
FORGET
EXACTLY
WHO
IS
SAYING
WHAT
OTC
TO
PLT
I
THINK
CLEAR
CAUTION
WARNING
MEMORY
VERIFY
NO
UNEXPECTED
ERRORS
I
AM
WONDERING
WHAT
AN
EXPECTED
ERROR
MIGHT
BE
SORRY
IF
THIS
IS
A
REALLY
DUMB
QUESTION
BUT
IN
PURE
SPECULATION
I
WOULD
GUESS
CAUTIONS
BASED
ON
HAZARDOUS
PRELAUNCH
OPS
WOULD
QUALIFY
SOMETHING
LIKE
CAUTION
SRBS
HAVE
JUST
BEEN
ARMED
ALSO
IN
PURE
SPECULATION
PARITY
ERRORS
IN
MEMORY
OR
PREVIOUSLY
KNOWN
CONDITIONS
THAT
WERE
WAIVERED
YES
THAT
IS
AN
ERROR
BUT
WE
ALREADY
KNEW
ABOUT
IT
ANY
PROBLEM
WHERE
THEY
DECIDED
A
BACKUP
WOULD
HANDLE
IT
ANY
PROBLEM
IN
AN
AREA
THAT
WAS
NOT
CRITICALITY
THAT
IS
ANY
PROBLEM
IN
A
SYSTEM
THEY
DECIDED
THEY
COULD
DO
WITHOUT
ID
BE
CURIOUS
AS
TO
WHAT
THE
REAL
MEANING
OF
THE
QUOTE
IS
