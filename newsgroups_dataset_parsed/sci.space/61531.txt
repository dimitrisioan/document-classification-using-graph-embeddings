NO
THE
THING
IS
DESIGNED
TO
BE
RETRIEVABLE
IN
A
PINCH
INDEED
THIS
DICTATED
A
RATHER
ODD
DESIGN
FOR
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
SINCE
THEY
HAD
TO
BE
RETRACTABLE
AS
WELL
AS
EXTENDABLE
WHY
NOT
DESIGN
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
TO
BE
DETACHABLE
IF
THE
SHUTTLE
IS
GOING
TO
RETUNR
THE
HST
WHAT
BOTHER
ARE
SOME
ARRAYS
THEY
CAN
BE
DETACHED
IN
AN
EMERGENCY
BUT
EXPENSIVE
HARDWARE
IS
NOT
THROWN
AWAY
CASUALLY
BEARING
IN
MIND
THAT
NOBODY
KNEW
THE
DESIGN
WAS
DEFECTIVE
IF
THE
DEPLOYMENT
CREW
HAD
FOUND
SOME
NASTY
FLAW
THE
LID
FAILING
TO
OPEN
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
BIT
EMBARRASSING
TO
HAVE
TO
THROW
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
AWAY
TO
GET
THE
THING
BACK
IN
THE
PAYLOAD
BAY
I
GUESS
ITS
KIND
OF
AN
AESTHETICS
ARGUMENT
I
CAN
SEE
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
BEING
EXPENSIVE
AND
THERE
COULD
BE
CONTINGENCIES
WHERE
YOU
WOULD
BE
THROWING
AWAY
BRAND
NEW
SOLAR
CELLS
BUT
IT
SEEMS
SO
CHEAP
COMPARED
TOA
SHUTTLE
MISSION
I
WOULDNT
THINK
THEY
WOULD
BOTHER
