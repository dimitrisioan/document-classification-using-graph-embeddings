RE
PHILOSOPHY
QUEST
HOW
BOLDLY
IN
ARTICLE
BOBOTHEJESTERCRAYCOM
BOB
KIERSKI
WRITES
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
PHILOSOPHICAL
QUESTIONS
THAT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
IF
WE
ENCOUNTER
A
LIFE
FORM
DURING
OUR
SPACE
EXPLORATION
HOW
DO
WE
DETERMINE
IF
WE
SHOULD
CAPTURE
IT
IMPRISON
IT
AND
THEN
DISCECT
IT
ANALOG
SF
MAGAZINE
DID
AN
ARTICLE
ON
A
SIMILAR
SUBJECT
QUITE
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THE
QUESTION
WAS
IF
AN
ALIEN
SPACECRAFT
LANDED
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
WHAT
WAS
THE
PROPER
ORGANIZATION
TO
DEAL
WITH
IT
THE
STATE
DEPARTMENT
ALIEN
AMBASSADORS
THE
DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT
ALIEN
INVADERS
THE
IMMIGRATION
AND
NATURALIZATION
SERVICE
ILLEGAL
ALIENS
THE
DEPARTMENT
OF
THE
INTERIOR
NEW
NONHUMAN
SPECIES
ETC
IT
WAS
VERY
MUCH
A
QUESTION
OF
OUR
PERCEPTION
OF
THE
ALIENS
NOT
OF
ANYTHING
INTRINSIC
IN
THEIR
NATURE
THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY
FOR
THE
ARTICLE
CITED
A
PHILOSOPHICAL
PAPER
THE
NAME
AND
AUTHOR
OF
WHICH
I
SADLY
FORGET
I
BELIEVE
THE
AUTHOR
WAS
ITALIAN
ON
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
A
LEGAL
ANDOR
MORAL
PERSON
IE
A
BEING
ENTITLED
TO
THE
RIGHTS
NORMALLY
ACCORDED
TO
A
PERSON
THE
PAPER
WAS
QUITE
INTERESTING
AS
I
RECALL
IF
WE
ENCOUNTER
A
CIVILIZATION
THAT
IS
SUFFERING
ECONOMICLY
WILL
WE
EXPEND
RESOURCES
FROM
EARTH
TO
HELP
THEM
I
THINK
YOUD
HAVE
TO
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
HERE
IF
THE
ANSWER
IS
YES
THE
HUMAN
TRACK
RECORD
ON
HELPING
THOSE
POOR
UNDERPRIVELEGED
CULTURES
DOES
UNDERPRIVELEGED
MEAN
NOT
HAVING
ENOUGH
PRIVELEGES
IS
TERRIBLE
THE
USUAL
RESULT
IS
THE
DESTRUCTION
OR
RADICAL
REORGANIZATION
OF
THE
CULTURE
THIS
MAY
NOT
ALWAYS
BE
WRONG
BUT
THATS
THE
WAY
TO
BET
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
DESEASES
WE
CURRENTLY
HAVE
THAT
ARE
DEADLY
AND
UNDETECTABLE
WHAT
WILL
BE
DONE
TO
ENSURE
THAT
MORE
NEW
DEADLY
DESEASES
ARENT
BROUGHT
BACK
OR
THAT
OUR
DESEASES
DONT
DESTROY
LIFE
ELSEWHERE
HAVE

DAY
