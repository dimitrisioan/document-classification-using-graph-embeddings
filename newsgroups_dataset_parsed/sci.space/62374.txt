LIFE

ARTICLE

JOHN
MCKERNAN
WRITES
SOME
NEW
INFORMATION
HAS
BEEN
DISCOVERED
RECENTLY
MICROSCOPIC
FOSSILS
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND
IN
VERY
OLD
ROCKS
THE
THEORY
IS
THAT
THIS
LIFE
IS
SO
OLD
THAT
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
DESTROYED
DURING
THE
PERIODIC
INTENSE
METEORITE
BOMBARDMENTS
THAT
WERE
A
FEATURE
OF
THE
EARLY
SOLAR
SYSTEM
UNDER
THIS
THEORY
LIFE
ORIGINATED
ON
EARTH
MULTIPLE
TIMES
BETWEEN
MULTIPLE
METEORITE
BOMBARDMENTS
AND
THEREFORE
THE
CONDITIONS
FOR
THE
CREATION
OF
LIFE
CANNOT
BE
THAT
UNLIKELY
THIS
WAS
ALL
BADLY
REPORTED
IN
THE
NEWS
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
SIGNS
OF
LIFE
FOUND
IN
OLD
ROCK
PREDATE
PUTATIVE
PLANETSTERILIZING
EVENTS
RATHER
THE
ARGUMENT
WAS
THAT
IF
LIFE
AROSE
SHORTLY
THE
LAST
STERILIZING
EVENT
THEN
IT
MUST
BE
EASILY
FORMED
THE
INFERENCE
WAS
THAT
LIFE
ORIGINATED
BEFORE
AND
WAS
DESTROYED
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
THAT
HOWEVER
EVEN
THIS
ARGUMENT
IS
FLAWED
IT
COULD
WELL
BE
THAT
ORIGIN
OF
LIFE
REQUIRES
SPECIFIC
CONDITIONS
SAY
A
CERTAIN
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
ATMOSPHERE
THAT
DO
NOT
LAST
FOR
LONG
SO
PERHAPS
LIFE
FORMED
EARLY
ONLY
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
NO
OTHER
CHANCE
TO
DO
SO
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
LIKELY
THAT
LIFE
WOULD
ORIGINATE
UNDER
THOSE
CONDITIONS
