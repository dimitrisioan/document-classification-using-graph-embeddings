SSTO
SENATORIAL
AIDE
BREIFING
RECOLLECTIONS
THE
FOLLOWING
ARE
MY
THOUGHTS
ON
A
MEETING
THAT
I
HUGH
KELSO
AND
BOB
LILLY
HAD
WITH
AN
AIDE
OF
SEN
PATTY
MURRAYS
WE
WERE
THERE
TO
DISCUSS
SSTO
AND
COMMERCIAL
SPACE
THIS
IS
HOW
IT
WENT
AFTER
RECEIVING
A
PACKET
CONTAINING
A
PRESENTATION
ON
THE
BENIFITS
OF
SSTO
I
CALLED
AND
TRIED
TO
SCHEDULE
A
MEETING
WITH
OUR
LOCAL
SENATOR
D
PATTY
MURRAY
WASHINGTON
STATE
I
STARTED
ASKING
FOR
AN
HOUR
AND
WHEN
I
HEARD
THE
GASP
ON
THE
END
OF
THE
PHONE
I
QUICKLY
BACKED
OFF
TO
AN
HOUR
LATER
IN
THAT
CONVERSATION
I
LEARNED
THAT
A
STANDARD
APPOINTMENT
IS
MINUTES
WE
GOT
THE
STANDARD
BOZO
TREATMENT
THAT
IS
WE
WERE
CALLED
BACK
BY
AN
AIDE
WHO
SCHEDULED
A
MEETING
WITH
US
IN
ORDER
TO
DETERMINE
THAT
WE
WERE
NOT
BOZOS
AND
TO
FAMILIARIZE
HIMSELF
WITH
THE
MATERIAL
AND
TO
SCREEN
IT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
IT
WAS
APPROPRIATE
TO
TAKE
THE
SENATORS
TIME
WITH
THAT
MATERIAL
WELL
I
GOT
ALLOCATED
HOUR
WITH
SEN
MURRAYS
AIDE
AND
WE
ENDED
UP
TALKING
TO
HIM
FOR
MINUTES
WITH
US
ENDING
THE
MEETING
AND
HIM
STILL
LISTENING
WE
COVERED
A
LOT
OF
GROUND
AND
ONLY
A
LITTLE
TINY
BIT
WAS
DCX
SPECIFIC
MOST
OF
IT
WAS
A
SINGLE
STAGE
REUSABLE
VEHICLE
PRIMER
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
WOMAN
THERE
WHO
TOOK
COPIUS
QUANTITIES
OF
NOTES
ON
EVERY
TOPIC
THAT
WE
BROUGHT
UP
BUT
WITH
MURRAY
BEING
NEW
WE
WANTED
TO
ENTRENCH
OURSELVES
AS
NONCORPORATE
ALIGNED
IE
NOT
SPEAKING
FOR
BOEING
LOCAL
CITIZENS
INTERENTESTED
IN
SPACE
SO
WE
SPENT
A
LOT
OF
TIME
COVERING
THE
BENIFITS
OF
LOWER
COST
ACCESS
TO
LEO
SOLAR
POWER
SATELLITES
ARE
A
BIG
FOCUS
HERE
SO
WE
HIT
THEM
AS
BECOMING
FEASIBLE
WITH
LOWER
COST
ACCESS
AND
WE
HIT
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
STAND
ON
THAT
WE
HIT
THE
TOURISM
ANGLE
AND
I
LEFT
A
COPY
OF
THE
PATRIC
COLLINS
TOURISM
PAPER
WITH
SIDE
NOTES
BEING
THAT
EVERYONE
WHO
GOES
INTO
SPACE
AND
SEES
THE
ATMOSPHERE
BECOMES
MORE
OF
AN
ENVIRONMENTALIST
ESP
AFTER
SEEING
THE
SMOG
OVER
LA
WE
HIT
ON
THE
BENIFITS
OF
STUDYING
BONE
DECALCIFICATION
WHICH
IS
MORE
PRONOUNCED
IN
SPACE
AND
SAID
THAT
THAT
HAD
POTENTIAL
TO
LEAD
TO
UNDERSTANDING
OF
AND
MAYBE
A
CURE
FOR
OSTEOPOROSIS
WE
HIT
THE
EDUCATION
WHEREBY
KIDS
GET
ENTHUSED
BY
SPACE
BUT
AS
THEY
GET
OLDER
AND
FIND
OUT
THAT
THEY
HAVENT
A
HOP
IN
HELL
OF
ACTUALLY
GETTING
THERE
THEY
GO
ON
TO
OTHER
FIELDS
WITH
LOW
COST
TO
ORBIT
THE
CHANCES
THEY
MIGHT
GET
THERE
SOMEDAY
WOULD
PROVIDE
GREATER
INCENTIVE
TO
HIT
THE
HARDER
CLASSES
NEEDED
WE
HIT
A
LITTLE
OF
THE
GET
NASA
OUT
OF
THE
OPERATIONAL
LAUNCH
VEHICLE
BUSINESS
ANGLE
WE
HIT
THE
LOWER
COST
OF
SATELLITE
LAUNCHES
GPS
NAVIGATION
PERSONAL
COMMUNICATORS
TELLECOMMUNICATIONS
NEW
SERVICES
ETC
JOBS
PROVIDED
IN
THOSE
SECTORS
JOBS
PROVIDED
BUILDING
THE
THING
BALANCE
OF
TRADE
IMPROVEMENT
ETC
WE
MENTIONED
THAT
SKYPIX
WOULD
BENIFIT
FROM
LOWER
LAUNCH
COSTS
WE
LEFT
THE
PAPER
ON
WHAT
TECHNOLOGIES
NEEDED
TO
BE
INVESTED
IN
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
THIS
EVEN
EASIER
TO
DO
AND
HE
ASKED
QUESTIONS
ON
THIS
POINT
WE
ENDED
BY
TELLING
HER
THAT
WE
WANTED
HER
TO
BE
AWARE
THAT
EFFORTS
ARE
PROCEEDING
IN
THIS
AREA
AND
THAT
WE
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THE
RESULTS
FROM
THESE
EFFORTS
ARE
NOT
LOST
MUCH
LIKE
CONDOR
OR
MAJELLAN
AND
MOST
IMPORTANTLY
WE
ASKED
THAT
SHE
HELP
FUND
FURTHER
EFFORTS
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
LOWERING
THE
COST
TO
LEO
IN
THE
MIDDLE
WE
ALSO
GAVE
A
LITTLE
SPEAL
ABOUT
THE
LUNAR
RESOURCE
DATA
PURCHASE
ACT
AND
THE
GUY
FILED
IT
SEPARATELY
HE
WAS
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
IT
HE
ASKED
SOME
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
IT
AND
SEEMED
LIKE
HE
WANTED
TO
JUMP
ON
IT
AND
CONTACT
SOME
OF
THE
PEOPLE
INVOLVED
WITH
IT
SO
SOMETHING
MAY
ACTUALLY
HAPPEN
IMMEDIATLY
THERE
THE
LAST
TWO
THINGS
WE
DID
WERE
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THEY
KNEW
THAT
WE
KNEW
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
SPACE
ARENA
HERE
IN
TOWN
AND
THAT
THEY
COULD
FEEL
FREE
TO
CALL
US
ANY
TIME
WITH
QUESTIONS
AND
IF
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
THE
ANSWERS
THAT
WE
WOULD
SEE
TO
IT
THAT
THEY
QUESTIONS
GOT
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
REALLY
DID
KNOW
THE
ANSWERS
THEN
FINALLY
WE
ASKED
FOR
AN
APPOINTMENT
WITH
THE
SENATOR
HERSELF
HE
SAID
THAT
WE
WOULD
GET
ON
THE
LIST
AND
HE
ALSO
SAID
THAT
KNOWING
HER
THIS
WOULD
BE
SOMETHING
THAT
SHE
WOULD
BE
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
ALTHOUGH
THEY
DO
HAVE
A
TIME
PROBLEM
GETTING
HER
SCHEDULED
SINCE
SHE
IS
ONLY
IN
THE
STATE
WEEK
OUT
OF
THESE
DAYS
ALL
IN
ALL
WE
FELT
LIKE
WE
DID
A
PRETTY
GOOD
JOB
