i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
much
easier
to
place
an
object
at
orbital
altitude
than
it
is
to
place
it
with
orbital
velocity
for
a
target
km
above
the
surface
of
earth
you
need
a
deltav
of
kms
assuming
that
rockets
with
specific
impulses
of
seconds
are
easy
to
produce
a
rocket
with
a
dry
weight
of
kg
would
require
only
about
kg
of
fueloxidizer
unfortunately
if
you
launch
this
from
the
us
or
are
a
us
citizen
you
will
need
a
launch
permit
from
the
office
of
commercial
space
transportation
and
i
think
it
may
be
difficult
to
get
a
permit
for
an
antisatellite
weapon
the
threshold
at
which
ocst
licensing
kicks
in
is
roughly
the
rules
are
actually
phrased
in
more
complex
ways
but
that
is
the
result
all
work
is
one
mans
work
