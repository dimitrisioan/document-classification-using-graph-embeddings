I
WOULD
JUST
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
IS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
PLACE
AN
OBJECT
AT
ORBITAL
ALTITUDE
THAN
IT
IS
TO
PLACE
IT
WITH
ORBITAL
VELOCITY
FOR
A
TARGET
KM
ABOVE
THE
SURFACE
OF
EARTH
YOU
NEED
A
DELTAV
OF

ASSUMING
THAT
ROCKETS
WITH
SPECIFIC
IMPULSES
OF
SECONDS
ARE
EASY
TO
PRODUCE
A
ROCKET
WITH
A
DRY
WEIGHT
OF
KG
WOULD
REQUIRE
ONLY
ABOUT
KG
OF
FUELOXIDIZER
UNFORTUNATELY
IF
YOU
LAUNCH
THIS
FROM
THE
US
OR
ARE
A
US
CITIZEN
YOU
WILL
NEED
A

PERMIT
FROM
THE
OFFICE
OF
COMMERCIAL
SPACE
TRANSPORTATION
AND
I
THINK
IT
MAY
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
GET
A
PERMIT
FOR
AN
ANTISATELLITE
WEAPON
THE
THRESHOLD
AT
WHICH
OCST
LICENSING
KICKS
IN
IS
ROUGHLY
THE
RULES
ARE
ACTUALLY
PHRASED
IN
MORE
COMPLEX
WAYS
BUT
THAT
IS
THE
RESULT
ALL
