speech
by
pete
worden
delivered
before
the
us
space
foundation
conference
colorado
springs
colorado
april
what
a
delightful
opportunity
to
cause
some
trouble
for
providing
me
this
forum
i
would
sincerely
like
to
thank
the
us
space
foundation
my
topic
today
is
the
single
stage
rocket
technology
rocket
or
ssrt
by
i
intend
to
speak
of
more
how
to
lower
the
cost
and
make
rapid
progress
ssrt
is
to
my
mind
and
i
hope
to
convince
you
the
erupting
a
new
rallying
cry
for
our
generation
in
space
faster
cheaper
and
better
faster
cheaper
better
and
ssrt
represent
the
passing
of
a
torch
from
one
technical
generation
to
another
it
is
a
new
thing
to
be
sure
but
it
is
also
a
relearning
of
old
things
from
past
masters
when
we
rolled
out
the
ssrt
baby
two
weeks
ago
so
called
experts
told
us
it
violates
the
laws
of
physics
it
made
no
sense
for
example
dr
eberhart
rachtin
former
president
of
the
aerospace
corp
said
of
ssrt
in
the
la
times
that
it
defies
the
best
principles
of
launching
payloads
into
space
well
dr
rachtin
youve
made
us
mad
what
are
these
principles
that
ssrt
defies
well
ill
tell
you
it
violates
the
principle
that
you
need
a
giant
program
office
to
build
space
hardware
it
violates
the
fact
that
it
takes
years
to
build
something
new
and
it
violates
the
truism
that
you
cant
do
anything
significant
for
less
than
many
billions
of
dollars
it
took
some
of
the
last
generations
experts
to
teach
us
some
newold
lessons
werhner
von
brauns
first
rocket
was
not
a
saturn
v
general
schrievers
icbms
didnt
take
ten
years
to
demonstrate
and
the
airplane
didnt
cost
billion
it
took
one
of
the
great
engineers
of
the
to
remind
us
of
these
truths
max
hunter
max
to
remind
you
was
a
senior
engineer
in
the
thor
irbm
program
and
old
faster
better
cheaper
success
story
max
has
been
persistent
in
a
vision
of
a
single
stage
reusable
space
launch
system
since
the
because
he
knew
it
had
to
be
done
in
affordable
steps
build
a
little
test
a
little
next
he
persuaded
us
to
do
a
technology
demonstration
we
didnt
solicit
a
bunch
of
requirements
theyd
just
change
every
few
years
anyway
not
included
in
the
speech
the
alsnls
has
such
ephemeral
requirements
that
it
would
better
known
as
shape
shifter
than
space
lifter
we
didnt
spend
a
lot
money
this
xrocket
only
cost
million
whens
the
last
time
we
even
built
a
new
airplane
for
that
and
it
didnt
take
a
lot
of
time
to
build
mcdonnell
douglas
completed
it
in
months
finally
the
government
program
office
consisted
of
one
very
overworked
air
force
major
motivated
in
part
by
the
threat
that
hed
get
to
ride
on
it
in
a
strappedon
lawn
chair
if
it
ran
over
cost
or
schedule
as
i
described
what
ssrt
is
and
isnt
keep
in
mind
its
only
a
first
step
there
are
several
more
steps
and
steps
that
can
easily
fail
before
the
us
can
field
an
ssto
but
each
step
should
follow
the
same
principles
a
small
management
team
a
few
years
technology
demonstration
and
a
modest
budget
let
me
show
a
few
details
on
ssrt
and
how
it
might
evolve
see
charts
im
embarrassed
when
my
generation
is
compared
with
the
last
generation
the
giants
of
the
last
great
space
era
the
and
they
went
to
the
moon
we
built
a
telescope
that
cant
see
straight
they
softlanded
on
mars
the
least
we
could
do
is
softland
on
earth
but
we
do
have
an
answer
we
can
follow
their
build
a
little
test
a
little
philosophy
to
produce
a
truly
affordable
and
routine
access
to
space
i
know
there
are
nay
sayers
among
you
those
who
say
ssrt
is
a
stunt
it
needs
more
thermal
protection
the
engines
are
wrong
it
would
be
better
to
land
horizontally
etc
etc
i
say
to
you
well
see
you
at
white
sands
in
june
you
bring
your
viewgraphs
and
ill
bring
my
rocketship
if
we
do
what
we
say
we
can
do
then
you
let
us
do
the
next
step
not
included
in
the
speech
if
we
fail
you
still
have
your
program
offices
staff
summary
sheets
requirement
analyses
and
decade
long
programs
i
bet
on
my
generation
and
max
hunters
idea
any
takers
