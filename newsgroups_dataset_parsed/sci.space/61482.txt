THE
LIMIT
ON

IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
SUIT

AND

DURATION
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANY
SPECIFICS
ON
THE
HST
REPAIR
MISSION
BUT
I
CANT
SEE
WHY
THE
MASS
MARGINS
ARE
TIGHT
WHAT
ARE
THEY
CARRYING
UP

COMPONENTS
WFPC

COSTAR
GYROS
SOLAR

AND
PROBABLY
A
FEW
OTHERS
ALL

AND
AS
MUCH
OMS
FUEL
AND
CONSUMABLES
AS
THEY
CAN
THIS
SHOULD
BE
LIGHTER
THAN
THE
ORIGINAL
HST
DEPLOYMENT
MISSION
WHICH
ACHIEVED
THE
HIGHEST
ALTITUDE
FOR
A
SHUTTLE
MISSION
TO
DATE
AND
HST
IS
NOW
IN
A

ONE
THING
TO
RECALL
PUTTING
A
SATELLITE
AS
HIGH
AS
POSSIBLE
IS
ONE
THING
COMING
BACK
TO
NOT
ONLY
THAT
ALTITUDE
BUT
MATCHING
THE
POSITION
OF
IT
IN
ITS
ORBIT
ON
A
SUBSEQUENT
MISSION
IS
ANOTHER
THING
ANY
MISALIGNMENT
OF
THE
PLANE
OF
THE
ORBIT
DURING
LAUNCH
OR
BEING
AHEAD
OR
BEHIND
THE
TARGET
WILL
REQUIRE
MORE
FUEL
TO
ADJUST
THIS
WAS
CONSIDERED
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
DEPLOYMENT
I
AGREE
THOUGH
THAT
THE
DEMANDS
ON
THE
CREW
AND
COMPLEXITY
ARE
STUPENDOUS
ONE
HAS
TO
ADMIRE
HOW
MUCH
THEY
ARE
TRYING
TO
DO
