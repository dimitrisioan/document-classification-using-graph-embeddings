YOULL
GET

TO
IT
EVENTUALLY
THE
GREAT
WESTERN
WAS
A
HIGHLY
SUCCESSFUL
TRANSATLANTIC
MAIL
SHIP
WITH
HYBRID
SAIL
AND
STEAM
PROPULSION
THE
GREAT
EASTERN
WHICH
BROKE
THE
LITTLE
GIANT
FINANCIALLY
AND
OTHERWISE
WAS
A
REVOLUTIONARY
LEAP
FORWARD
IN

DESIGN
A
THIRTY
THOUSAND
TON
ALL
STEEL
VESSEL
WITH
PRIMARY
STEAM
PROPULSION
IT
WAS
AT
THE
TIME
EASILY
THE
BIGGEST

EVER
BUILT

ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
CARGO
AND
OR
FUEL
CAPACITY
ROSE
WITH
THE
CUBE
OF
SCALE
WHILE
DRAG
ROSE
WITH
THE
SQUARE
SO
A
REALLY
BIG
SHIP
COULD
STEAM
THOUSANDS
OF
MILES
WITHOUT
COALING
UNFORTUNATELY
THERE
WAS
NO
REAL
MARKET
FOR
SUCH
A
BEAST
AT
THE
TIME
AND
IT
WAS
EVENTUALLY
SOLD
OFF
AT
SCRAP
VALUES
AS
ANOTHER

SAID
IT
THEN
WENT
ON

A
SUCCESSFUL
CAREER

IT
WAS
IN

THE
ONLY

OF

HOW

WAS

I
THINK
THATS
RIGHT
IF
THATS
HOW
THE
SHUTTLE
GOES
DOWN
IN
HISTORY
AS
A
TECHNICAL
TRIUMPH
AND
A
FINANCIAL
DISASTER
FOR
THE
BUILDER
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
ENTIRELY
IGNOBLE
BUT
I
DOUBT
IF
HISTORY
WILL
BE
SO
CHARITABLE
ITS
TRUE
THE
SHUTTLE
CAN
DO
THINGS
NO
OTHER
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
CAN
DO
BUT
ARE
THEY
WORTH
DOING
WITH
LOW

YOU
