PHILOSOPHY
QUEST
HOW
BOLDLY
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
PHILOSOPHICAL
QUESTIONS
THAT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
IF
WE
ENCOUNTER
A
LIFE
FORM
DURING
OUR
SPACE
EXPLORATION
HOW
DO
WE
DETERMINE
IF
WE
SHOULD
CAPTURE
IT
IMPRISON
IT
AND
THEN
DISCECT
IT
IF
WE
ENCOUNTER
A
CIVILIZATION
THAT
IS
SUFFERING
ECONOMICLY
WILL
WE
EXPEND
RESOURCES
FROM
EARTH
TO
HELP
THEM
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
DESEASES
WE
CURRENTLY
HAVE
THAT
ARE
DEADLY
AND
UNDETECTABLE
WHAT
WILL
BE
DONE
TO
ENSURE
THAT
MORE
NEW
DEADLY
DESEASES
ARENT
BROUGHT
BACK
OR
THAT
OUR
DESEASES
DONT
DESTROY
LIFE
ELSEWHERE
HAVE
A
DAY
BOBO
