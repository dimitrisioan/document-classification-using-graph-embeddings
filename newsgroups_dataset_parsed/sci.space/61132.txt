BASED
ON

BASICALLY
WHAT
WEVE
DONE
BY
GOING
TO
FIVE
EVAS
RATHER
THAN
THREE
IS
TO
REPACKAGE
OUR
MARGIN
SO
THAT
WE
HAVE
THE

TO
RESPOND
TO
THE

MISSION
DIRECTOR

SAID
IT
IMPROVES
THE
PROBABILITIES
FOR
MISSION
SUCCESS
WHILE
PROVIDING
ADDED
FLEXIBILITY

DIRECTOR
FOR
THE

WHILE
THE
FIVE

WILL
BE
UNPRECEDENTED
THE

INTO

HEFLIN
SAID
IN

FOR

IT
IS
