given
that
fact
and
the
spacecraft
attitude
knowledge
of
approx
arcmin
we
might
be
able
to
figure
out
how
well
batse
can
determine
the
location
rotational
of
a
gamma
ray
burster
from
knowledge
of
the
allsky
maps
accuracy
pr
material
for
the
other
three
instruments
give
accuracies
on
the
order
of
fractions
of
a
degree
if
thats
any
help
but
i
believe
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
here
the
other
x
three
instruments
are
focusing
instruments
that
more
or
less
form
an
image
so
positional
errors
are
limited
by
craft
attitude
and
the
resolving
power
of
the
optics
batse
is
an
altogether
different
beast
effectively
just
coincidence
counters
one
on
each
corner
of
the
craft
positional
information
is
triangulated
from
the
differential
signal
arrival
times
at
each
of
the
detectors
positional
error
would
be
predominantly
determined
by
timing
errors
and
errors
in
craft
attitude
since
none
of
the
baste
detectors
have
any
independant
angular
resolution
whatsoever
they
can
not
be
used
to
determine
parallax
indeed
parallax
would
just
add
a
very
small
component
to
the
positional
error
demonstrating
that
these
puppies
are
beyond
the
oort
cloud
would
require
resolution
on
the
order
of
arcseconds
since
the
oort
cloud
is
postulated
to
extend
to
about
parsec
all
together
now
parallax
arc
second
a
parsec
is
the
distance
of
an
object
that
demonstrates
one
arc
second
of
parallax
with
a
au
base
line
if
the
degree
accuracy
reported
above
is
true
were
going
to
have
to
add
a
baste
to
the
pluto
fast
flyby
to
get
enough
baseline
the
beauty
of
baste
is
that
it
both
gives
positional
information
and
watches
the
entire
sky
simultaneously
a
realy
handy
combination
when
you
have
no
idea
where
the
next
burst
is
coming
