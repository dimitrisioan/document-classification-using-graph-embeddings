END
OF
THE
SPACE
AGE
THERE
IS
AN
INTERESTING
OPINION
PIECE
IN
THE
BUSINESS
SECTION
OF
TODAYS
LA
TIMES
THURSDAY
APRIL
P
I
THOUGHT
ID
POST
IT
TO
STIR
UP
SOME
FLAME
WARS
I
MEAN
REASONED
DEBATE
LET
ME
PREFACE
IT
BY
SAYING
THAT
I
LARGELY
AGREE
THAT
THE
SPACE
AGE
IN
THE
ROMANTIC
SENSE
OF
SEVERAL
DECADES
AGO
IS
OVER
AND
THAT
PROJECTS
LIKE
THE
SPACE
STATION
MISS
THE
POINT
AT
THIS
TIME
READING
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHATS
NEW
THE
WEEKLY
PHYSICS
UPDATE
WE
GET
HERE
ON
THE
NET
ITS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
ROMANCE
OF
THE
DAY
LIES
IN
THE
EVER
MORE
FINEGRAINED
MANIPULATION
OF
MATTER
BY
WHICH
I
INCLUDE
BIOTECHNOLOGY
CONDENSED
MATTER
PHYSICS
WITH
ITS
SPINOFFS
IN
COMPUTER
HARDWARE
AND
ELSEWHERE
AND
THE
AMAZING
THINGS
PEOPLE
ARE
DOING
WITH
INDIVIDUAL
ATOMS
THESE
DAYS
TO
A
LARGE
EXTENT
I
THINK
THE
ROMANCE
SOME
PEOPLE
STILL
HAVE
WITH
SPACE
IS
A
MATTER
OF
NOSTALGIA
I
FEEL
SURE
THAT
SOMEDAY
WE
OR
MORE
PRECISELY
OUR
MIND
CHILDREN
WILL
SPREAD
ACROSS
SPACE
UNLESS
WE
WIPE
OURSELVES
OUT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
MANNED
SPACE
EXPLORATION
IS
NOT
WHAT
IS
EXCITING
ABOUT
WHAT
WE
CAN
DO
NOW
ANYWAY
LET
ME
QUOTE
SOME
OF
THIS
ARTICLE
BUT
NOT
ALL
SPACE
AGE
GLORY
FADES
FROM

MICHEAL
SCHRAGE
WRITER

ASSOCIATE
AT
MIT
AT
AMERICAS
SPACE
AGE
WONT
HAVE
TO
SUFFER
THROUGH
THE
ANGST
OF
A
MIDLIFE
CRISIS
THE
REASON
IS
THAT
THE
SPACE
AGE
IS
ALREADY
DEAD
THE
TECHNOLOGIES
NO
LONGER
DEFINE
OUR
TIMES
AND
THE
PUBLIC
HAS
GROWN
WEARY
OF
THE
MULTIBILLION
DOLLAR
CELESTIAL
INVESTMENTS
THAT
YIELD
MINIMAL
PSYCHIC
OR
ECONOMIC
REWARDS
SPACE
EXPLORATION
HAS
MUTATED
FROM
A
CENTRAL
FOCUSE
OF
AMERICAS
SCIENCE
AND
TECHNOLOGY
DEBATE
INTO
A
PERIPHERAL
ISSUE
SPEACE
IS
NOT
A
MEANINGFUL
PART
OF
THE
ONGOING
INDUSTRIAL
COMPETITIVENESS
DEBATE
OUR
TECHNOLOGY
INFRASTRUCTURE
DISCUSSIONS
OR
EVEN
OUR
DEFENSE
CONVERSION
POLICY
TO
BE
SURE
AMERICA
SHOULD
CONTINUE
TO
INVEST
IN
SATELLITE
TECHNOLOGIES
FOR
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AND
REMOTE
SENSING
CHEAP
DEEPSPACE
PROBES
WOULD
BE
NICE
TOO
BUT
THE
IDEAL
OF
SPACE
AS
A
MEANINGFUL
DRIVER
OF
SCIENTIFIC
AND
INDUSTRIAL
INNOVATION
IS
NOW
DEAD
BEFORE
THE
CHANGE
IN
ADMINISTRATIONS
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
FOOLISH
TO
WRITE
AN
OBITUARY
FOR
THE
SPACE
AGE
THE
BUSH
WHITE
HOUSE
AGGRESSIVELY
SUPPORTED
THE
SPACE
PROGRAM
AND
PROPOSED
SPENDING

WAS

THE
REALITY
THAT
MUCH
OF
THE
CIVILIAN
SPACE
PROGRAM
FROM
THE
SHUTTLE
TO
THE
HUBBLE
TELESCOPE
TO
THE
SPACE
STATION
WAS
POORLY
CONCEIVED
AND
UNIMPRESSIVELY
IMPLEMENTED
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
MATTER
MUCH
POLITICAL
INERTIA
AND
A
NOSTALGIC
SENSE
OF

INDEED
WITH

NOTABLE

SUCH
AS

THE

ERA
IS
THE
STORY
OF
THE
GOLDPLATED
PORKIFICATION
OF
SPACE
EXPLORATION
WITH
PROGRAMS
AND
PROMISES
THAT
DELIVERED
LESS
FOR
MORE
AND
MORE
WHILE
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
KEPT
ON
THE
HIGHLY
REGARDED
DANIEL
GOLDIN
AS
ADMINISTRATOR
OF
THE
NATIONAL
AERONAUTICS
AND
SPACE
ADMINISTRATION
IT
SEEMS
CLEAR
THAT
SPACE
EXPLORATION
IS
NOT
BEING
POSITIONED
AS
EITHER
A
SYMBOLIC
OR
SUBSTANTIVE
CENTERPIECE
OF
AMERICAS
TECHNOLOGICAL
PROWESS
THE
SPACE
STATION
BUDGET
HAS
RIGHTLY
BEEN
SLASHED
SPACE
IS
VIRTUALLY
IGNORED
WHEN
THE
ADMINISTRATION
CHAMPIONS
ITS
COMPETITIVENESS
AGENDA
I
WISH
THIS
HAD
HAPPENED
YEARS
AGO
INSTEAD
OF
STARTING
TO
HAPPEN
NOW

PUT
OFF

WOULD
RATHER
SEE
