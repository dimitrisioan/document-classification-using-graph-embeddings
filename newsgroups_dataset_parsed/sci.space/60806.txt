THERE
IS
AN
EMERGENCY
OXYGEN
SYSTEM
THAT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
MAINTAINING
A
BREATHABLE
ATMOSPHERE
IN
THE
CABIN
FOR
LONG
ENOUGH
TO

DOWN
EVEN
IF
THERE
IS
SOMETHING

WOW
DOUBLE
WOW
CAN
YOU
LAND
A
SHUTTLE
WITH
A
HOLE
IN
THE
WALL
PERSONNALLY
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
TRY
IT
SOMETIME
PROGRAMMATICALLY
YES
WE
CAN
LAND
AN
ORBITER
WITH
A
CM
HOLE
IN
THE
WALL
PROVIDED
THAT
THE
THING
WHICH
CAUSED
CM
HOLE
DIDNT
CAUSE
A
CRIT
FAILURE
ON
SOME
OF
THE
INTERNAL
SYSTEMS
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
PLACES
WHERE
A
CM
HOLE
WOULD
CAUSE
A
BAD
DAY
ESPECIALLY
IF
THE
CM
HOLE
WENT
ALL
THE
WAY
THROUGH
THE
ORBITER
AND
OUT
THE
OTHER
SIDE
AS
COULD
EASILY
HAPPEN
WITH
A
METEOR
STRIKE
BUT
A
HOLE
IN
THE
PRESSURE

WOULD
CAUSE
