WRITES
ALL
OF
THIS
TALK
ABOUT
A
COMMERCIAL
SPACE
RACE
IE
TO
THE
FIRST
MOON
BASE
IS
INTRIGUING
SIMILAR
PRIZES
HAVE

DEVELOPMENT
BEFORE
THE
ORTEIG
PRIZE
HELPED
LINDBERGH
SELL
HIS
SPIRIT
OF
SAINT
LOUIS
VENTURE
TO
HIS
FINANCIAL
BACKERS
BUT
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
THAT
HIS
SAINT
LOUIS
BACKERS
HAD
THE
FORESIGHT
TO
REALIZE
THAT
MUCH
MORE
WAS
AT
STAKE
THAN
COULD
IT
WORK
WITH
THE
MOON
WHO
ARE
THE
FARSIGHTED
FINANCIAL
BACKERS
OF
TODAY
THE
COMMERCIAL
USES
OF
A
TRANSPORTATION
SYSTEM
BETWEEN
ALREADYSETTLED
ANDCIVILIZED
AREAS
ARE
OBVIOUS
SPACEFLIGHT
IS
NOT
IN
THIS
POSITION
THE
CORRECT
ANALOGY
IS
NOT
WITH
AVIATION
OF
THE
BUT
THE
LONG
TRANSOCEAN
VOYAGES
OF
THE
AGE
OF
DISCOVERY
IT
DIDNT
REQUIRE
GOVT
TO
FUND
THESE
AS
LONG
AS
SOMETHING
WAS
KNOWN
ABOUT
THE
POTENTIAL
FOR
PROFIT
AT
THE
DESTINATION
IN
PRACTICE
SOME
WERE
GOVT
FUNDED
SOME
WERE
PRIVATE
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
WAY
THAT
ANY
WISE
INVESTOR
WOULD
SPEND
A
LARGE
AMOUNT
OF
MONEY
ON
A
VERY
RISKY
INVESTMENT
WITH
NO
IDEA
OF
THE
POSSIBLE
PAYOFF
I
AM
SURE
THAT
A
THRIVING
SPACEFLIGHT
INDUSTRY
WILL
EVENTUALLY
DEVELOP
AND
LARGE
NUMBERS
OF
PEOPLE
WILL
LIVE
AND
WORK
OFFEARTH
BUT
IF
YOU
ASK
ME
FOR
SPECIFIC
JUSTIFICATIONS
OTHER
THAN
THE
INCREASED
RESOURCE
BASE
I
CANT
GIVE
THEM
WE
JUST
DONT
KNOW
ENOUGH
THE
LAUNCH
RATE
DEMANDED
BY
EXISTING
SPACE
INDUSTRIES
IS
JUST
TOO
LOW
TO
BRING
COSTS
DOWN
MUCH
AND
WE
ARE
VERY
MUCH
IN
THE
DARK
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
REVOLUTIONARY
NEW
SPACE
INDUSTRIES
WILL
BE
WHEN
THEY
WILL
PRACTICAL
HOW
MUCH
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
INVESTED

START
