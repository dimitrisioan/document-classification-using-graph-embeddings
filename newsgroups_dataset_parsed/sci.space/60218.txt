WRITES
COMET
GEHRELS
WHICH
WAS
DISCOVERED
IN
WAS
DETERMINED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
IN
A
TEMPORARY
JOVIAN
ORBIT
FROM
TO
COMET
SHOEMAKERLEVY
MAY
REMAIN
IN
ORBIT
AROUND
JUPITER
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
ALLOW
GALILEO
TO
MAKE
SOME
CLOSEUP
OBSERVATIONS
THE
ORBITAL
TRAJECTORY
FOR
COMET
SHOEMAKERLEVY
IS
STILL
BEING
DETERMINED
A
WHAT
ABOUT
POSITIONAL
UNCERTAINTIES
IN
SL
I
ASSUME
WE
KNOW
WHERE
AND
WHAT
GALILEO
IS
DOING
WITHIN
A
FEW
METERS
BUT
WITHOUT
THE
HGA
DONT
WE
HAVE
TO
HAVE
SOME
PRETTY
GOOD
IDEAS
OF
WHERE
TO
LOOK
BEFORE
IMAGING
IF
THE
HGA
WAS
WORKING
THEY
COULD
SLEW
AROUND
IN
NEAR
REAL
TIME
LESS
SPEED
OF
LIGHT
DELAY
BUT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
IMAGING
TOUTATIS
DIDNT
SOMEONE
HAVE
TO
GET
LUCKY
ON
A
GUESS
TO
FIND
THE
FIRST
IMAGES
ALSO
I
IMAGINE
SL
WILL
BE
MOSTLY
A
VISUAL
IMAGE
SO
HOW
WILL
THAT
AFFECT
THE
OTHER
IMAGING
MISSIONS
WITH
THE
LGA
THERE
IS
A
REAL
TIGHT
ALLOCATION
OF
BANDWIDTH
IT
MAY
BE
PREMATURE
TO
HOPE
FOR
ANSWERS
BUT
I
THOUGHT
ID
THROW
IT
ON
THE
FLOOR
PAT
