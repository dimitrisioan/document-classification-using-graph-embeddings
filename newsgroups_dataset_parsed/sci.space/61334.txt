re
gamma
ray
bursters
where
are
they
in
article
writes
batse
by
having
detectors
of
its
own
can
do
its
own
location
determination
but
only
to
within
about
degrees
would
someone
at
gsfc
like
david
like
to
comment
on
the
current
state
of
location
determination
having
inde
pendent
sightings
by
other
detectors
helps
drive
down
the
uncertainty
well
ill
avoid
your
question
for
now
got
some
learnin
to
do
with
a
promise
to
come
back
with
more
info
when
i
can
find
it
i
do
know
that
batse
is
the
primary
instrument
in
the
development
of
the
allsky
map
of
longterm
sources
given
that
fact
and
the
spacecraft
attitude
knowledge
of
approx
arcmin
we
might
be
able
to
figure
out
how
well
batse
can
determine
the
location
rotational
of
a
gamma
ray
burster
from
knowledge
of
the
allsky
maps
accuracy
pr
material
for
the
other
three
instruments
give
accuracies
on
the
order
of
fractions
of
a
degree
if
thats
any
help
speaking
of
gro
the
networld
probably
was
happy
to
see
that
the
preps
for
orbit
adjust
appear
to
be
going
well
our
branch
guy
whos
helping
out
says
that
things
have
gone
smoothly
with
the
isovalve
preps
and
the
burns
will
take
place
in
midjune
anyway
im
off
to
find
out
more
be
back
when
i
get
some
info
david
w
gsfc
i
dont
know
nuthin
bout
measurin
no
gamma
rays
gone
with
the
wind
