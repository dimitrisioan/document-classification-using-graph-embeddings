why
do
spacecraft
have
to
be
shut
off
after
funding
cuts
for
example
why
couldnt
magellan
just
be
told
to
go
into
a
safe
mode
and
stay
bobbing
about
venus
in
a
lowpoweruse
mode
and
if
maybe
in
a
few
years
if
funding
gets
restored
after
the
economy
gets
better
hopefully
it
could
be
turned
on
again
it
can
be
but
the
problem
is
a
political
one
not
a
technical
one
