the
only
thing
that
scares
me
is
the
part
about
simply
strapping
ssmes
and
a
nosecone
on
it
and
just
launching
it
i
have
this
vision
of
something
going
terribly
wrong
with
the
launch
resulting
in
the
complete
loss
of
the
new
modular
space
station
not
just
a
peice
of
it
as
would
be
the
case
with
staged
inorbit
construction
it
doesnt
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
actually
since
they
werent
building
spares
of
the
station
hardware
anyway
dumb
at
least
this
is
only
one
launch
to
fail
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
