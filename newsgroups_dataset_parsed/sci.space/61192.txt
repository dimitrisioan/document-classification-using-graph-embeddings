THING
THAT
SCARES
ME
IS
THE
PART
ABOUT
SIMPLY
STRAPPING
SSMES
AND
A
NOSECONE
ON
IT
AND
JUST
LAUNCHING
IT
I
HAVE
THIS
VISION
OF
SOMETHING
GOING
TERRIBLY
WRONG
WITH
THE
LAUNCH
RESULTING
IN
THE
COMPLETE
LOSS
OF
THE
NEW
MODULAR
SPACE
STATION
NOT
JUST
A
PEICE
OF
IT
AS
WOULD
BE
THE
CASE
WITH
STAGED
INORBIT
CONSTRUCTION
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
A
WHOLE
LOT
OF
DIFFERENCE
ACTUALLY
SINCE
THEY
WERENT
BUILDING
SPARES
OF
THE
STATION
HARDWARE
ANYWAY
