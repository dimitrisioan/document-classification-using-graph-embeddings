THE
BEST
EXAMPLE
OF
HUMAN
ENDURANCE
IN
TERMS
OF

IE
LOW
ATMOSPHERIC
PRESSURE
AND
LOWER
OXYGEN
PARTIAL
PRESSURE
IS
IN
MY
OPINION
TO
THE
SCALING
OF
MT
EVEREST
WITHOUT
OXYGEN
ASSISTANCE
THIS
IS
QUITE
A
FEAT
OF
PHYSIOLOGICAL
ENDURANCE
INDEED
SO
ITS
AT
THE
EXTREME
LIMIT
OF
WHAT
IS
HUMANLY
POSSIBLE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
ONLY
BECAUSE
MOUNT
EVEREST
IS
AT
A
FAIRLY
LOW
LATITUDE
THERE
IS
A
SLIGHT
EQUATORIAL
BULGE
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE
BEYOND
WHAT
IS
INDUCED
BY
THE
EARTHS
ROTATION
THANKS
TO
THE
OVERALL

FLOWING

WHERE
IT
IS
WARMED

THIS
HELPS
JUST
ENOUGH
TO

YOU
