this
might
point
out
some
key
discriminators
in
judging
the
feasibility
of
a
commercial
launch
site
these
include
is
there
an
identified
key
customer
to
provide
core
usage
sufficient
to
recover
setup
costs
is
there
a
market
advantage
of
using
the
site
can
existing
infrastructure
be
used
or
modified
at
the
site
can
financing
be
found
at
low
enough
cost
to
support
the
investment
other
commercial
launch
site
ventures
including
those
at
woomera
poker
flat
cape
york
white
sands
alabama
offshore
platform
hawaii
and
vandenberg
have
to
also
be
judged
against
these
criteria
in
my
opinion
some
of
these
ventures
are
flying
on
hope
and
speculation
and
not
on
sound
financial
grounds
this
reminds
me
my
fuzzy
brain
recalls
that
somebody
was
thinking
of
reviving
the
san
marco
launch
platform
off
the
coast
of
kenya
where
the
copernicus
satellite
was
launched
around
is
this
true
or
am
i
imagining
it
possibly
its
connected
with
one
of
the
italian
programs
to
revive
the
scout
in
a
new
version
that
old
platform
must
be
getting
pretty
rusty
and
there
aint
a
lot
of
infrastructure
to
go
with
it
