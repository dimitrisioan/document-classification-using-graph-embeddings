i
would
appreciate
any
thoughts
on
what
makes
a
planet
habitable
for
humans
i
am
making
asumptions
that
life
and
a
similar
atmosphere
evolve
given
a
range
of
physical
aspects
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physical
aspects
simply
disallow
earth

dandridge
cole
and
isaac
asimov
collaborated
on
a
book
titled
habitable
planets
for
man
i
think
in
it
should
be
available
in
most
good
libraries
or
through
interlibrary
loan

is
the
highschool

original
rand

planets
for
man
gives
the
harder
numbers
graphs
such
but
predates
michael
harts
later
work
on
continuously
habitable
zones
