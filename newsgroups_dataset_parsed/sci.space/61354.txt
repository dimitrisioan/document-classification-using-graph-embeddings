getting
at
here
this
puppy
is
far
enough
away
that
if
a
bright
burst
happens
nearby
the
huge
annulus
created
by
it
will
hopefully
intersect
the
line
or
general
circle
given
by
batse
and
we
can
get
a
moderately
accurate
position
say
oh
or
degrees
that
is
the
closest
anyone
has
ever
gotten
with
it
you
can
do
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
better
than
or
degrees
with
the
differential
timing
measurements
from
the
interplanetary
network
ignore
the
directional
information
from
batse
just
look
at
the
time
of
arrival
with
three
detectors
properly
arranged
one
can
often
get
positions
down
to
arc
minutes
btw
about
oort
cloud
sources
shouldnt
this
be
testable
in
the
fairly
near
future
some
of
the
grbs
have
very
short
rise
times
ms
we
could
detect
the
curvature
of
the
burst
wavefront
out
to
a
distance
of
on
the
order
of
c
where
b
is
the
detector
spacing
and
t
the
time
resolution
for
t
ms
and
b
au
this
is
on
the
order
of
light
years
i
understand
statistics
will
reduce
this
number
considerably
as
would
geometry
if
the
burst
is
coming
from
the
wrong
direction
