I
WAS
READING
POPULAR

MORNING

WAS
SURPRISED
BY
AN
AD
IN
THE
BACK
I
KNOW
THAT
A
LOT
OF
THE
ADS
IN
THE
BACK
OF
PS
ARE
FRINGE
SCIENCE
OR
QUESTIONABLELY
LEGAL
BUT
THIS
ONE
REALLY
GRABBED
MY
ATTENTION
IT
WAS
FROM
A
COMPANY
NAME
PERSONAL
MISSLE
INC
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
ANYHOW
THE
AD
STATED
THAT
THEYD
SELL
ROCKETS

LENGTH
AND
ENGINES
OF
SIZES
F
TO
M
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
SOME
ROCKETS
WILL
REACH
FEET
NOW
ASIDE
FROM
THE
OBVIOUS
DANGERS
TO
ANY
AMATEUR
ROCKETEER
USING
ONE
OF
THESE
BEASTS
ISNT
THIS
ILLEGAL
I
CANT
IMAGINE
THE
FAA
ALLOWING
PEOPLE
TO
SHOOT
ROCKETS
UP
THROUGH
THE
FLIGHT
LEVELS
OF
PASSENGER
PLANES
NOT
TO
EVEN
MENTION
THE
PROBLEM
OF
LOCATING
A
ROCKET

COMES
DOWN

NOT
GOING

EVEN
THINK
OF
BUYING

AN
OUTGROWTH
OF

THIS
HOBBY
USES
NONMETALLIC
STRUCTURAL
COMPOMENTS

CLASSIFICATION
FROM
