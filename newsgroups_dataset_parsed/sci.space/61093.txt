wanna
guess
which
today
youd
need
to
launch

to
send
up
large
amounts
of
stuff
do
you
know
of
a
private
titan
pad
doug
actually
if
memory
serves
the
atlas
is
an
outgrowth
of
the
old
titan
icbm
if
so
theres
probably
quite
a
few
old
pads
albeit
in
need
of
some
serious
reconditioning
still
being
able
to
buy
the
turf
and
pad
and
bunkers
including
prep
facility
at
midwest
farmland
prices
strikes
me
as
pretty
damned
cheap
