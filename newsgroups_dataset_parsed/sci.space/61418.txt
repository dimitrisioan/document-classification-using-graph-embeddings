announcement
the
hyperknowledge
project
for
nextstep
i
know
this
is
kinda
off
the
subject
of
scispace
but
not
really
i
want
to
answer
this
for
their
as
well
as
everyone
elses
information
what
these
people
are
proposing
by
and
large
already
exists
and
can
be
purchased
today
it
is
called
labview
by
national
instruments
it
is
a
wonderful
object

i
am
afraid
you
are
misdirected
nextstep
is
an
operating
system
as
opposed
to
a
package
i
have
read
a
little
about
it
but
since
steve
jobs
does
not
seem
to
have
the
marketing
capabilities
of
bill
gates
my
info
is
limited
probably
why
the
far
inferior
windows
nt
is
going
to
be
more
widely
distributed
but
that
is
another
flameridden
story
some
of
the
innovative
features
of
nextstep
are
binary
compatibility
across
platforms
eg
you
can
just
copy
your
program
from
a
sparc
to
a
pc
and
it
would
run
as
opposed
to
buying
the
version
of
the
package
ported
to
a
pc
graphical
objectoriented
design
its
all
wsiwig
postscript
supports
parallel
hetrogeneous
processing
and
best
of
all
it
is
based
around
the
mach
microkernel
so
you
can
make
it
look
like
unix
with
x
or
dos
or
nt
or
even
vms
if
you
feel
the
need
no
package
out
there
comes
even
close
i
hope
people
will
subscribe
to
the
hyperknowledge
project
and
nextstep
finally
takes
off
in
my
lifetime
