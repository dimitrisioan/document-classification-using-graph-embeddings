latest
navstar
gps
constellation
status
it
states
that
the
latest
satellite
was
placed
in
orbit
plane
position
there
is
already
one
satellite
in
that
position
i
know
that
its
almost
ten
years
since
that
satellite
was
launched
but
its
still
in
operation
so
why
not
use
it
until
it
goes
off
why
not
instead
place
the
new
satellite
at
since
that
position
is
empty
and
by
this
measure
have
an
almost
complete
gpsconstellation
