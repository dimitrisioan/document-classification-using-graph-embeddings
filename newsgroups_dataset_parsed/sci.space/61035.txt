CRAZY
OR
JUST
IMAGINITIVE
I
HAVE
A
NICE
QUOTE
THAT
I
LIKE
OR
AS
CLOSE
AS
I
CAN
REMEMBER
IT
IF
I
SAY
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
THINK
IS
CRAZY
ASK
ME
WHAT
I
MEAN
BEFORE
YOU
THINK
ITS
CRAZY
SO
SOME
OF
MY
IDEAS
ARE
A
BIT
ODD
OFF
THE
WALL
AND
SUCH
BUT
SO
WAS
WILBUR
AND
ORVILLE
WRIGHT
AND
QUITE
A
FEW
OTHERS
SORRY
IF
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
BIG
DEGREES
AND
SUCH
BUT
I
THINK
I
MIGHT
BE
WRONG
TO
ERROR
IS
HUMAN
I
HAVE
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
IN
MANY
WAYS
JUST
AS
IMPORTANT
I
HAVE
IMAGINATION
DREAMS
AND
WITHOUT
DREAMS
ALL
THE
KNOWLEDGE
IS
WORTHLESS
SORRY
MY
TWO
CENTS
WORTH
OR
IS
IT
TWO
RUBLES
WORTH
THE
BASIC
QUOTE
IDEA
IS
FROM
H
BEAM
PIPERS
BOOK
SPACE
VIKINGS
ITS
A
GOOD
BOOK
ON
HOW
CIVILIZATION
CAN
FALL
AND
HOW
IT
CAN
BE
RAISED
TO
NEW
HEIGHTS
UNFORTUNATELY
H
BEAM
PIPER
KILLED
HIM
SELF
JUST
WEEKS
SHORT
OF
HAVING
HIS
FIRST
BOOK
PUBLISHED
AND
HAVE
HIS
IDEAS
SEE
LIGHT
SUCH
A
WASTE
