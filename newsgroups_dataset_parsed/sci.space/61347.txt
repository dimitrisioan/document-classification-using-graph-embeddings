WRITES
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
A
REFERENCE
SOMETHING
I
CAN
LOOK
UP
NOT
JUST
YOUR
OWN
RECOLLECTIONS
I
HAVE
A
FEW
OF
THOSE
MYSELF
ON
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
NIGHT
SKY
AS
SEEN
FROM

NOTE
I
AM
NOT
TALKING

HENRY
IF
I
READ
YOU
CORRECTLY
YOU
MAY
BE
ASKING
IF

PUT
A
BLACKBODY
IN
INTERSTELLAR
SPACE
DISREGARDING
THE

NEARBY

WHAT
TERMPERATURE
WILL
IT
REACH
IN
THERMAL
EQUILIBRIUM
WITH
THE

IF
THATS
THE
CASE
LET
ME
POINT
OUT
THAT
INTERSTELLAR
DUST
AND
MOLECULES
PROVIDE
MANY
INSTANCES
OF
THINGS
THAT
ARE
WELL
NOTTOOFAR
FROM
BEING
BLACKBODIES
MANY
DIFFERENT
OBSERVATIONS
INCLUDING
IRAS
AND
COBE
HAVE
DETERMINED
THAT
INTERSTELLAR
