JAMES
THOMAS
GREEN
WRITES
IF
THEY
HAD
BEATEN
US
I
SPECULATE
THAT
THE
US
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
HEAD
AND
DONE
SOME
LANDINGS
BUT
WE
ALSO
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
DETERMINED
TO
SET
UP
A
BASE
BOTH
IN
EARTH
ORBIT
AND
ON
THE
MOON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
WOULD
BE
ON
MARS
BY
NOW
WOULD
DEPEND
UPON
WHETHER
THE
SOVIETS
TRIED
TO
GO
SETTING
UP
A
LUNAR
BASE
WOULD
HAVE
STRETCHED
THE
BUDGETS
OF
BOTH
NATIONS
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THE
MILITARY
VALUE
OF
A
LUNAR
BASE
WOULD
OUTWEIGH
THE
VALUE
OF
GOING
TO
MARS
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
SHORT
RUN
THUS
WE
WOULD
HAVE
CONCENTRATED
ON
THE
MOON
GREAT
SPECULATION
I
REMEMBER
BEING
PROUD
ON
BEHALF
OF
ALL
THE
FREE
WORLD
YOU
THINK
THAT
WAY
WHEN
YOU
ARE
SEVEN
YEARS
OLD
THAT
WE
HAD
GOT
THERE
FIRST
NOW
IM
ALMOST
SORRY
THAT
IT
WORKED
OUT
THAT
WAY
I
GUESS
THE
SOVIETS
WOULD
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
VICTORY
SERIOUSLY
TOO
AND
WOULD
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
NOT
HAVE
FALLEN
VICTIM
TO
THE
COMPLACENCY
THAT
OVERTOOK
THE
US
PROGRAM
PERHAPS
STRETCHING
TO
MATCH
US
EFFORTS
WOULD
HAVE
DESTABILIZED
THEM
SOONER
THAN
IT
DID
IN
FACT
AND
IN
THE
TRADITION
OF
MARVEL
COMICS
WHAT
IF
THIS
DESTABILIZATION
IN
THE
BREZHNEV
ERA
MIGHT
HAVE
TRIGGERED
THE
THIRD
WORLD
WAR
HMM
MAYBE
IT
WAS
A
GIANT
