DEATH
AND
TAXES
WAS
WHY
NOT
GIVE
BILLION
TO
IN
MY
FIRST
POSTING
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
I
THREW
OUT
AN
IDEA
OF
HOW
TO
FUND
SUCH
A
CONTEST
WITHOUT
DELVING
TO
DEEP
INTO
THE
BUDGET
I
MENTIONED
GRANTING
MINERAL
RIGHTS
TO
THE
WINNER
MY
ACTUAL
WORDING
WAS
MINING
RIGHTS
SOMEBODY
POINTED
OUT
QUITE
CORRECTLY
THAT
SUCH
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
ANYBODYS
TO
GRANT
ALTHOUGH
I
IMAGINE
IT
WOULD
BE
A
FAIT
ACCOMPLI
SITUATION
FOR
THE
WINNER
SO
HOW
ABOUT
THIS
GIVE
THE
WINNING
GROUP
I
CANT
SEE
ONE
COMPANY
OR
CORP
DOING
IT
A
OR
YEAR
MORATORIUM
ON
