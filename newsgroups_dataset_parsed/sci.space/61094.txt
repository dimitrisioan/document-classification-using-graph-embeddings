death
and
taxes
was
why
not
give
billion
to
in
my
first
posting
on
this
subject
i
threw
out
an
idea
of
how
to
fund
such
a
contest
without
delving
to
deep
into
the
budget
i
mentioned
granting
mineral
rights
to
the
winner
my
actual
wording
was
mining
rights
somebody
pointed
out
quite
correctly
that
such
rights
are
not
anybodys
to
grant
although
i
imagine
it
would
be
a
fait
accompli
situation
for
the
winner
so
how
about
this
give
the
winning
group
i
cant
see
one
company
or
corp
doing
it
a
or
year
moratorium
on
taxes
