RE
PHILOSOPHY
QUEST
HOW
BOLDLY
IN
ARTICLE
DOUG
LOSS
WRITES
ANALOG
SF
MAGAZINE
DID
AN
ARTICLE
ON
A
SIMILAR
SUBJECT
QUITE
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THE
QUESTION
WAS
IF
AN
ALIEN
SPACECRAFT
LANDED
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
WHAT
WAS
THE
PROPER
ORGANIZATION
TO
DEAL
WITH
IT
THE
STATE
DEPARTMENT
ALIEN
AMBASSADORS
THE
DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT
ALIEN
INVADERS
THE
IMMIGRATION
AND
NATURALIZATION
SERVICE
ILLEGAL
ALIENS
THE
DEPARTMENT
OF
THE
INTERIOR
NEW
NONHUMAN
SPECIES
ETC
IT
WAS
VERY
MUCH
A
QUESTION
OF
OUR
PERCEPTION
OF
THE
ALIENS
NOT
OF
ANYTHING
INTRINSIC
IN
THEIR
NATURE
THE
BIBLIOGRAPHY
FOR
THE
ARTICLE
CITED
A
PHILOSOPHICAL
PAPER
THE
NAME
AND
AUTHOR
OF
WHICH
I
SADLY
FORGET
I
BELIEVE
THE
AUTHOR
WAS
ITALIAN
ON
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
A
LEGAL
ANDOR
MORAL
PERSON
IE
A
BEING
ENTITLED
TO
THE
RIGHTS
NORMALLY
ACCORDED
TO
A
PERSON
THE
PAPER
WAS
QUITE
INTERESTING
AS
I
RECALL
THIS
IS
A
WHOLE
DIFFERENT
SITUATION
IF
ALIENS
WERE
ABLE
TO
GET
HERE
PRIOR
TO
US
BEING
ABLE
TO
GET
THERE
ONE
MIGHT
CONCLUDE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BE
MORE
ADVANCED
AND
THEREFORE
MORE
INTELEGENT
THAT
WE
ARE
HOWEVER
IF
WE
GET
SOMEWHERE
WHERE
THERE
IS
LIFE
CHANCES
ARE
WE
WONT
BE
ABLE
TO
COMMUNICATE
WITH
THEM
SO
WE
WILL
HAVE
NO
CLUE
AS
TO
WEATHER
THEY
ARE
INTELEGENT
OR
NOT
I
THINK
YOUD
HAVE
TO
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
HERE
IF
THE
ANSWER
IS
YES
THE
HUMAN
TRACK
RECORD
ON
HELPING
THOSE
POOR
UNDERPRIVELEGED
CULTURES
DOES
UNDERPRIVELEGED
MEAN
NOT
HAVING
ENOUGH
PRIVELEGES
IS
TERRIBLE
THE
USUAL
RESULT
IS
THE
DESTRUCTION
OR
RADICAL
REORGANIZATION
OF
THE
CULTURE
THIS
MAY
NOT
ALWAYS
BE
WRONG
BUT
THATS
THE
WAY
TO
BET
THATS
A
GOOD
POINT
I
HADNT
THOUGHT
OF
IT
THAT
WAY
MY
QUESTION
HOWEVER
WAS
MORE
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
EVERY
YEAR
THE
US
SPENDS
MILLIONS
OF
TAX
DOLLARS
AND
GIVING
TAX
BREAKS
TO
INDIVIDUALS
AND
COMPANIES
WHO
FEED
THE
POOR
OF
FOREIGN
COUNTRIES
WHILE
THOUSANDS
OF
OUR
OWN
PEOPLE
SLEEP
ON
THE
STREETS
AT
NIGHT
WOULD
WE
GIVE
TO
THE
ECONOMICLY
DISSADVANTAGED
ON
ANOTHER
PLANET
IF
WE
HADNT
RESOLVED
THESE
ISSUES
ON
OUR
OWN
BUT
YOUR
COMMENT
BRINGS
UP
ANOTHER
GOOD
QUESTION
OVER
THE
YEARS
WE
HAVE
DECIDED
THAT
CERTAIN
CULTURES
NEED
IMPROVEMENTS
THE
NATIVE
AMERICANS
IS
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
PRIOR
TO
OUR
ATTEMPT
TO
CIVILIZE
THEM
THE
NATIVE
AMERICAN
CULTURE
HAD
VERY
LITTLE
CRIME
NO
HOMELESSNES
NO
POVERTY
THEN
THE
EUROPEANS
CAME
ALONG
AND
NOW
THEY
HAVE
THOSE
AND
MORE
IF
WE
ENCOUNTER
LIFE
ELSEWHERE
DO
WE
TELL
THEM
THEY
HAVE
TO
LIVE
IN
HOUSES
FARM
THE
LAND
AND
GO
TO
CHURCH
ON
SUNDAY
HAVE
A
DAY
BOBO
