WRITES
ALSO
PERIHELIONS

AUGUST
JUPITER

WHERE
JUPITER
RADIUS
KM
MI
AU
SO
THE
FIGURE
SEEMS
UNLIKELY
TO
ACTUALLY
BE
ANYTHING
BUT
A
PERIJOVE
IS
THAT
THE
CASE
FOR
THE
FIGURE
AS
WELL
SORRY
PERIJOVESIM
NOT
USED
TO
TALKING
THIS
LANGUAGE
HMMMM
THE
PREFIX
PERI
IS
GREEK
NOT
LATIN
SO
ITS
USUALLY
USED
WITH
THE
GREEK
FORM
OF
THE
NAME
OF
THE
BODY
BEING
ORBITED
THATS
WHY
ITS
PERIHELION
RATHER
THAN
PERISOL
PERIGEE
RATHER
THAN
PERITERR
AND
PERICYNTHION
RATHER
THAN
PERILUNE
SO
FOR

EXPECT
IT
TO
BE
SOMETHING
LIKE
