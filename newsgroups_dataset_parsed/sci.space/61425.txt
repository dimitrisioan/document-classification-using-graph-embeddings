THE
FIRST
ITEM
OF
BUSINESS
IS
TO
ESTABLISH
THE
IMPORTANCE
SPACE
LIFE
SCIENCES
IN
THE
WHOLE
OF
SCHEME
OF
HUMANKIND
I
MEAN
COMPARED
TO
FOOTBALL
AND
BASEBALL
THE
AVERAGE
JOE
SCHMOE
DOESNT
SEEM
INTERESTED
OR
EVEN
CURIOUS
ABOUT
SPACEFLIGHT
I
DISAGREE
IT
THINK
THE
AVERAGE
JOE
IS
INTERESTEDCURIOUS
ABOUT
SPACEFLIGHT
BUT
SEES
IT
AS
AN
ELITIST
ACTIVITY
NOT
ONE
WHICH
HE
IS
EVER
GOING
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
ALL
OF
US
IN
OUR
OWN
WAY
CAN
CONTRIBUTE
TO
A
COMPREHENSIVE
DOCUMENT
WHICH
CAN
BE
RELEASED
TO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
AROUND
THE
WORLD
THE
DOCUMENT
WOULD
SCIENTIFICALLY
ANALYZE
THE
TECHNICAL
ASPECTS
OF
LONG
TERM
HUMAN
HABITATION
IN
SPACE
WHY
IS
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
GOING
TO
BE
INTERESTED
IN
THE
TECHNICAL
DETAILS
OF
LONG
TERM
SPACE
HABITATION
I
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
STUDY
BUT
IT
SHOULD
BE
RELEASED
TO
OTHER
SCIENTISTS
AND
ENGINEERS
WHO
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
IT
IF
YOU
WANT
A
GENERAL
PUBLIC
DOCUMENT
YOULL
NEED
A
MORE
GENERAL
PUBLICATION
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
ANY
LONGTERM
SPACE
EXPLORATION
PROGRAM
IS
TO
SUCCEED
WE
NEED
TO
BASICALLY
LEARN
HOW
TO
ENGINEER
OUR
OWN
MICROWORLD
IE
THE
SPACECRAFT
ONLY
THROUGH
THE
CAREFUL
ANALYSES
OF
ENGINEERING
CHEMICAL
BIOLOGICAL
AND
MEDICAL
FACTORS
WILL
A
GOOD
ECOSYSTEM
BE
CREATED
TO
FACILITATE
HUMAN
LIFE
ON
A
LONGDURATION
FLIGHT
AS
ONE
WORKING
ON
CONTROLLED
ECOLOGICAL
LIFE
SUPPORT
SYSTEMS
ENGINEERING
THE
MICROWORLD
ISNT
THE
PROBLEM
THE
PROBLEM
IS
UNDERSTANDING
THE
BASIC
CHEMICAL
BIOLOGICAL
AND
MEDICAL
FACTORS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
ENGINEER
THEM
EFFICIENTLY
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
ONLY
WAY
WE
KNOW
HOW
TO
PRODUCE
FOOD
IS
FROM
PLANTS
AND
ANIMALS
FOOD
SYNTHESIS
IS
NOT
VERY
FAR
ADVANCED
SO
WE
HAVE
TO
ORBIT
A
FARM
WELL
THATS
OBVIOUSLY
NOT
VERY
EFFICIENT
SO
WE
USE
TECHNOLOGY
TO
REDUCE
THE
MASS
AND
GROW
PLANTS
HYDROPONICALLY
INSTEAD
OF
USING
DIRT
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
ENGINEERING
COMES
IN
BUT
NEW
TECHNOLOGIES
BRING
NEW
BASIC
QUESTIONS
THAT
WE
DONT
HAVE
THE
ANSWERS
TO
LIKE
IN
DIRT
WE
CAN
GROW
TOMATOES
AND
LETTUCE
RIGHT
BESIDE
EACH
OTHER
BUT
IN
HYDROPONICS
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
YOU
CANT
DO
THAT
THE
LETTUCE
GROWTH
IS
STUNTED
WHEN
ITS
GROWN
IN
THE
SAME
HYDROPONIC
SOLUTION
AS
TOMATOES
SO
NOW
YOU
HAVE
TO
CONSIDER
WHAT
OTHER
PLANTS
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
SIMILAR
INTERACTIONS
THIS
MEANS
SOME
BASIC
APPLIED
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
AND
THATS
WHAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
DONE
WITH
ALL
TECHNOLOGIES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
DEVELOPED
SO
FAR
WE
ALSO
NEED
TO
FIND
OUT
HOW
THEY
INTERACT
TOGETHER
THATS
WHERE
WE
ARE
NOW
SO
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
POSTS
OF
OPINIONS
REGARDING
THE
MOST
OBJECTIVE
METHODS
TO
ANALYZE
THE
ACCEPTED
SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE
FOR
TECHNOLOGIES
WHICH
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
LONGDURATION
SPACEFLIGHT
FIRST
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
THE
LITERATURE
SEARCH
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
INFORMATION
OUT
THERE
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
JUST
PICK
A
SPECIFIC
AREA
OF
LONG
TERM
HABITATION
THIS
COULD
BE
USEFUL
ESPECIALLY
IF
WE
MAKE
IT
AVAILABLE
ON
THE
NET
THEN
WE
CAN
LOOK
AT
METHODS
OF
ANALYZING
THE
TECHNOLOGIES
SUCH
A
DETAILED
LITERATURE
SEARCH
WOULD
BE
OF
INTEREST
TO
OURSELVES
AS
SPACE
ADVOCATES
AND
CLEARLY
IMPORTANT
TO
EXISTING
SPACE
PROGRAMS
IN
ESSENCE
WE
WOULD
BE
DIVIDING
THE
SPACE
LIFE
SCIENCE
ISSUES
INTO
VARIOUS
TECHNICAL
PROBLEMS
WHICH
COULD
BE
SOLVED
WITH
VARIOUS
TECHNOLOGIES
THIS
DATABASE
OF
ACCEPTABLE
SOLUTIONS
TO
VARIOUS
PROBLEMS
COULD
FORM
THE
BASIS
OF
DETAILED
DISCUSSIONS
INVOLVING
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
BIONET
ISUNET
AND
ANY
OTHER
SOURCE
UNLESS
THERE
IS
AN
UNBELIEVABLE
OUTPOURING
OF
INTEREST
ON
THIS
ON
THE
NET
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
DEVELOP
A
DETAILED
DATA
BASE
OF
THE
LITERATURE
SEARCH
FIRST
THEN
IF
WE
ACCOMPLISH
THAT
WE
CAN
GO
ON
TO
REAL
ANALYSIS
THE
DATA
BASE
ITSELF
COULD
BE
USEFUL
FOR
FUTURE
ENGINEERS
THATS
MY
RESPONSE
KEN
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
TIM
