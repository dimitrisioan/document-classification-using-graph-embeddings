HERE
IS
A
WAY
TO
GET
THE
COMMERICIAL
COMPANIES
INTO
SPACE
AND
MINERAL
EXPLORATION
BASICALLY
GET
THE
ECOFREAKS
TO
MAKE
IT
SO
HARD
TO
GET
THE
MINERALS
ON
EARTH
THEY
ARENT
GOING
TO
LEAVE
A
LOOPHOLE
AS
GLARING
AS

MINING
QUITE
A
FEW
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
ARE
WHEN
YOU
COME
RIGHT
DOWN
TO
IT
BASICALLY
AGAINST
INDUSTRIAL
CIVILIZATION
THEY
WONT
STOP
WITH
SHUTTING
DOWN
THE
MINES
HERE
THAT
IS
ONLY
A
MEANS
TO
AN
END
FOR
THEM
NOW
THE
WORST
THING
YOU
CAN
SAY
TO
A
TRUE
REVOLUTIONARY
IS
THAT
HIS
REVOLUTION
IS
UNNECESSARY
THAT
THE
PROBLEMS
CAN
BE
CORRECTED
WITHOUT
RADICAL
CHANGE
TELLING
PEOPLE
THAT
PARADISE
CAN
BE
ATTAINED
WITHOUT
THE
REVOLUTION
IS
TREASON
OF
THE
VILEST
KIND
TRYING
TO
HARNESS
THESE
PEOPLE
TO
SUPPORT
SPACEFLIGHT
IS
LIKE
TRYING
TO
HARNESS
A
BUFFALO
TO
PULL
YOUR
PLOUGH

ALL
RIGHT
BUT
THE
FURROW
WILL
GO
WHERE
HE
WANTS
NOT
WHERE
YOU
WANT
