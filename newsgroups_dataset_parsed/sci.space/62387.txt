crap
always
bugged
the
hell
out
of
me
too
until
i
found
an
actual
live
reallife
example
of
it
working
i
quote
from
aviation
week
and
space
technology
for
july
page
he
colonel
charles
f
stirling
speaking
of
the
problem
of
fuel
bubble
formation
in
titan
aerojet
engines
said
engineers
at
nasas
jet
propulsion
laboratory
had
run
into
the
same
problem
and
suggested
that
the
air
force
look
at
the
effect
of
aerozene
decomposition
the
fix
now
flown
three
times
without

was
to
reverse
the
inlet

outlet
portions
of

hot

cooler
once

life
imitates
art
how
about
the
discussion
of
the
sts
tether
experiment
ran
forward
it
would
suck
energy
from
the
earths
magnetic
field
while
trivially
slowing
the
shuttle
it
could
also
have
run
backward
if
they
ran
electricity
through
the
tether
the
other
way
it
would
have
trivially
propelled
the
shuttle
faster
but
an
even
better
example
comes
to
mind
theres
this
electronics
guy
someone
like
craig
anderton
or
don
lancaster
ten
years
ago
he
wrote
about
an
invention
of
his
he
could
take
a
lightdetector
run
current
through
it
at
about
a
hundred
times
its
rating
and
it
would
glow
he
got
legal
rights
to
this
design
of
a
combination
fiber
optic
emitterreceiver
this
turned
out
to
be
the
basic
unit
of
atts
i
think
plan
to
bring
brazils
communications
system
into
the
century
the
article
was
mostly
about
his
legal
wranglings
with
the
company
that
eventually
got
him
wellcompensated

his
invention
