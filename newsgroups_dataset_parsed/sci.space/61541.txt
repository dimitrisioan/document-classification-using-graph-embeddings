HOW
MUCH
ENERGY
DOES
A
BURSTER
PUT
OUT
I
KNOW
ENERGY
DEPENDS
ON
DISTANCE
WHICH
IS
UNKNOWN
AN
ANSWER
OF
THE
FORM
X
ERGS
PER
IS
OK
DIFFERENT
SPHERES
CLOUD
RADIUS
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
GALAXY
OR
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
GALACTIC
CORONA
AND
LASTLY
AT
A
FOR
A
RADIUS
OF
PC
WE
FOUND
AN
L
AROUND
ERGSEC
PRETTY
ENERGETIC
FOR
CLOSE
BY
FOR
THE
CORONAL
MODEL
WE
FOUND
AROUND

AND
LASTLY
FOR
THE
COSMOLOGICAL
MODEL
AN
THATS
WHAT
YOUD
CALL
MODERATELY
ENERGETIC
ID
SAY
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
ABOUT
WHAT
COULD
PUT
OUT
THAT
MUCH
ENERGY
IN
ONE
SECOND
JEREMY
SUPERNOVAE
PUT
OUT
OR
I
FORGET
WHICH
BUT
ITS
ONLY
AN
ORDER
OF
MAGNITUDE
NOT
IN
GAMMA
RAYS
THOUGH
YOUD
HAFTA
GET
ALL
OF
THAT
INTO
GAMMAS
IF
THEY
WERE
AT
MPC
BUT
IF
A
DECENT
FRACTION
OF
THE
SN
OUTPUT
WAS
IN
GAMMAS
IT
COULD
REASONABLY
BE
EXTRAGALACTIC
BUT
CLOSER
THAN
MPC
I
DUNNO
SN
THEORY
SO
WELL
BUT
I
CANT
THINK
OF
HOW
TO
GET
MANY
GAMMAS
OUT
MAYBE
I
SHOULD
LOOK
IT
UP
BIG
RADIO
GALAXIES
CAN
PUT
OUT
ERGS
CONTINUALLY
THATS
JUST
IN
THE
RADIO
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
GAMMAS
AROUND
THEM
TOO
BUT
BURSTS
NAH
NEITHER
OF
THESE
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
AS
EXPLANATIONS
JUST
TRYING
TO
SHOW
THAT
THOSE
ENERGIES
ARE
PRODUCED
BY
THINGS
