A
STAFFER
JUST
TOLD
ME
AN
INTERESTING
STORY
ABOUT
DCX
AN
AIR
FORCE
COSTING
TEAM
JUST
LOOKED
AT
THE
DCX
NOW
CALLED
THE
BTW
AND
GAVE
AN
ESTIMATE
ON
HOW
MUCH
IT
WOULD
COST
THE
AIR
FORCE
TO
BUILD
IT
IT
COST
SDIO
TO
BUILD
AND
IT
WOULD
COST
THE
USAF
MILLION
OR
FOUR
AND
A
HALF
TIMES
AS
MUCH
ID
BE
WILLING
TO
BET
THAT
A
MAJORITY
OF
THE
COST
DIFFERENCE
COULD
BE
ACCOUNTED
FOR
BY
THE
AFS
REQUIREMENT
FOR
SUPERFLUOUS
DOCUMENTATION
OR
HUGE
REQUIREMENTS
AND
DESIGN
REVIEWS
TRAVEL
EXPENSES
FLYING
PERSONNEL
AROUND
TO
MEETINGS
AND
OVER
SPECIFYING
THE
HARDWARE
I
DOUBT
THAT
THE
ACTUAL
FABRICATION
COST
IN
MATERIALS
AND
LABOR
WOULD
BE
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
SDIOS
COSTS
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
MY
CYNICAL
OPINION
BASED
ON
YEARS
OF
WATCHING
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROCUREMENT
PROCESS
TRY
TO
COVER
UP
A
LACK
OF
CREATIVITY
AND
INNOVATION
WITH
REAMS
OF
DOCUMENTATION
