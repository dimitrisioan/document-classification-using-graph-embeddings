why
do
you
need
to
boost
the
orbit
on
this
mission
anyway
you
dont
need
to
but
its
desirable
hst
like
all
satellites
in
low
earth
orbit
is
gradually
losing
altitude
due
to
air
drag
it
was
deployed
in
the
highest
orbit
the
shuttle
could
reach
for
that
reason
it
needs
occasional
reboosting
or
it
will
eventually
reenter
it
has
no
propulsion
system
of
its
own
this
is
an
excellent
opportunity
given
that
there
may
not
be
another
visit
for
several
years
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
