what
about
light
pollution
in
observations
i
read
somewhere
else
that
it
might
even
be
visible
during
the
day
leave
alone
at
night
i
cant
believe
that
a
milelong
billboard
would
have
any
significant
effect
on
the
overall
sky
brightness
venus
is
visible
during
the
day
but
nobody
complains
about
that
besides
its
in
leo
so
it
would
only
when
i
was
at
the
texas
star
party
a
few
years
ago
the
sky
was
so
dark
that
venus
did
indeed
cause
light
pollution
until
it
set
even
if
the
billboard
were
dark
it
could
cause
a
problem
imagine
observing
an
object
and
halfway
through
your
run
your
object
was
occulted
i
would
guess
that
most
of
the
people
stating
positive
opinions
are
not
fanatically
serious
observers
it
is
so
typical
that
the
rights
of
the
minority
are
extinguished
by
the
wants
of
the
majority
no
matter
how
ridiculous
those
wants
might
be
