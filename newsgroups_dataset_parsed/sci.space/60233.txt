TODAY
THE
WASHINGTON
POST
RAN
AN
ARTICLE
WITH
THE
HEADLINE
SHOWN
ABOVE
THE
ARTICLE
STARTS
WITH
A
LEADER
OF
THE
NASA
TEAM
IN
CHARGE
OF
REDESIGNING
THE
PLANNED
SPACE
STATION
SAID
YESTERDAY
THE
JOB
IS
TOUGH
AND
MAY
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
OCONNOR
IS
QUOTED
SAYING
WHETHER
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
CUT
COSTS
THAT
MUCH
AND
STILL
PROVIDE
FOR
MEANINGFUL
RESEARCH
IS
A
REAL
QUESTION
FOR
ME
OCONNOR
SAID
EVERYTHING
IS
FAIR
GAME
INCLUDING
DROPPING
OR
CURTAILING
EXISTING
CONTRACTS
WITH
THE
AEROSPACE
INDUSTRY
CHOPPING
MANAGEMENT
OF
THE
SPACE
STATION
PROGRAM
AT
SOME
NASA
FACILITIES
AROUND
THE
COUNTRY
WORKING
CLOSELY
WITH
THE
RUSSIAN
SPACE
STATION
MIR
AND
USING
UNMANNED
TITAN
ROCKETS
TO
SUPPLEMENT
THE
MANNED
SPACE
SHUTTLE
FLEET
OCONNOR
SAYS
HIS
TEAM
HAS
REVIEWED
DESIGN
OPTIONS
SO
FAR
AND
THEY
ARE
SORTING
THE
SERIOUS
CANDIDATES
INTO
THREE
CATEGORIES
BASED
ON
COST
THE
POST
SAYS
OCONNOR
DESCRIBED
THE
DESIGN
DERIVED
FROM
THE
CURRENT
SSF
AS
A
HIGH
COST
OPTION
I
BELIEVE
KATHY
SAWYER
THE
POST
WRITER
GOT
CONFUSED
HERE
I
LISTENED
IN
ON
PART
OF
OCONNORS
BRIEFING
TO
THE
PRESS
ON
MONDAY
AND
IN
ONE
PART
OF
THE
BRIEFING
OCONNOR
TALKED
ABOUT
HOW
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
WANTS
THREE
OPTIONS
SORTED
BY
COST
LOW
MEDIUM
AND
HIGH
IN
ANOTHER
PART
OF
THE
BRIEFING
HE
DISCUSSED
THE
THREE
TEAMS
HE
HAS
FORMED
TO
LOOK
AT
THREE
OPTIONS
SSF
DERIVATIVE
LARC
MODULAR
BUILDUP
WITH
MSFC
AND
SINGLE
LAUNCH
CORE
WINGLESS
ORBITER
JSC
LATER
IN
RESPONSE
TO
A
REPORTERS
QUESTION
I
THOUGHT
I
HEARD
OCONNOR
SAY
THE
OPTION
BASED
ON
A
SSF
REDESIGN
WAS
A
MODERATE
COST
OPTION
IN
BETWEEN
LOW
HIGH
COST
OPTIONS
NOT
THE
HIGH
COST
OPTION
AS
SAWYER
WROTE
THE
ARTICLE
GOES
ON
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
OTHER
TWO
OPTIONS
AS
ONE
FEATURES
MODULES
THAT
COULD
GRADUALLY
BE
FITTED
TOGETHER
IN
ORBIT
SIMILAR
TO
THE
RUSSIAN
MIR
THE
OTHER
IS
A
CORE
FACILITY
THAT
COULD
BE
DEPOSITED
IN
ORBIT
IN
A
SINGLE
LAUNCH
LIKE
SKYLAB
THAT
OPTION
WOULD
USE
EXISTING
HARDWARE
FROM
THE
SPACE
SHUTTLE
THE
FUSELAGE
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
ITS
BASIC
STRUCTURE
THE
LAST
SENTENCE
IN
THE
ARTICLE
CONTRADICTS
THE
TITLE
THE
FIRST
PARAGRAPH
THE
SENTENCE
READS
HE
OCONNOR
SAID
A
STREAMLINED
VERSION
OF
THE
PLANNED
SPACE
STATION
FREEDOM
IS
STILL
POSSIBLE
WITHIN
THE
ADMINISTRATIONS
BUDGET
GUIDELINES
