PAT
WRITES
GIVEN
THAT
WHAT
I
DESCRIBED
FOR
THE
HST
SEEMED
TO
BE
THE
SMT
AND
GIVEN
THE
MASS
AMRGINS
ON
THE
DISCOVERY
MISSION
IS
TIGHT
ENOUGH
THAT
SPACEWALKING
HAS
TO
BE
CAREFULLY
CONSTRAINED
NO
EDO
PALLETS
NO
SPARE
SUITS
NO
EXTRA
MMUS
HAS
SOMEONE
ACTUALLY
VERIFIED
THAT
MASS
IS
THE
PREDOMINANT
CONSTRAINT
ON
THIS
MISSION
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
ASSUMING
IT
WITHOUT
GIVING
SUPPORTING
EVIDENCE
SOMEONE
FROM
NASA
POSTED
THAT
THERE
WERE
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
MASS
MARGINS
ON
THE
HST
REBOOST
MISSION
A
WHILE
BACK
I
HAD
ASKED
WHY
NOT
CARRY
THE
EDO
PALLET
UP
AND
THE
ANSWER
WAS
THE
MASS
MARGINS
WERE
TIGHT
ENOUGH
THEY
WERENT
EVEN
CARRYING
EXTRA
SUITS
WHY
NOT
DO
THIS
QUICK
TEST
GOLDINS
PHILOSOPHJY
OF
FASTER
CHEAPER
BETTER
BUILD
A
REAL
FAST
SPACE
TUG
TO
HANDLE
THE
REBOOST
OF
THE
HST
USING
CLEAN
CRYO
FUELS
AND
GET
IT
READY
BEFORE
THE
HST
MISSION
PAT
THIS
WOULD
BE
SLOWER
MORE
EXPENSIVE
AND
WORSE
SLOWER
THE
SHUTTLE
MISSION
IS
SCHEDULED
TO
GO
UP
IN
DECEMBER
THATS
LESS
THAN
EIGHT
MONTHS
AWAY
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
YOU
COULD
BUILD
NEW
HARDWARE
RETRAIN
AND
RESCHEDULE
THE
EVAS
IN
THAT
TIME
WHERES
WINGO
WHEN
YOU
NEED
HIM
COME
ON
KNOCK
THAT
ST
OFF
YOU
FORGET
THAT
DURING
SKYLAB
THEY
DID
OVERNIGHT
MISSION
PLANNING
FOR
THE
REPAIR
EVAS
ALSO
DURING
THEØÄ
INTELSAT
MISSION
THEY
DID
OVERNIGHT
WETF
SIMULATIONS
I
SOMEHOW
THINK
THEY
COULD
TRAIN
UP
A
NEW
EVA
IN
MONTHS
AND
AS
FOR
BUILDING
HARDWARE
ANYTHING
CAN
BE
BUILT
IF
YOU
WANT
IT
BAD
ENOUGH
YOU
FORGET
THE
BUS
IS
ALREADY
BUILT
ALL
THEYD
AHVE
TO
DO
IS
SOUP
IT
UP
EVEN
TEST
IT
ON
A
DELTA
MISSION
DONT
GET
INTO
THIS
MODE
OF
NEGATIVISM
BESIDES
AT
THE
RATE
MISSIONS
SLIP
THE
DISCOVERY
WONT
LAUNCH
ON
THIS
MISSION
UNTIL
MARCH
THATS
ALMOST
A
YEAR
MORE
EXPENSIVE
YOUR
PROPOSAL
STILL
REQUIRES
THE
SHUTTLE
TO
DO
EVERYTHING
IT
WAS
GOING
TO
DO
EXECPT
FIRE
THE
OMS
IN
ADDITION
YOUVE
ADDED
SIGNIFICANT
EXTRA
COST
FOR
A
NEW
PIECE
OF
COMPLEX
HARDWARE
AH
BUT
HOW
MUCH
MORE
EXPENSIVE
IS
THE
SECOND
HST
SERVICING
MISSION
YOU
FORGET
THERE
IS
A
BUM
FGS
THE
SOLAR
ARRAY
ELECTRONICS
ARE
GETTING
HINKY
AND
THERE
IS
STILL
MONTHS
UNTIL
THE
SERVICING
MISSION
THE
TIME
FOR
THE
SPACE
WALKS
ARE
GROWING
RAPIDLY
THIS
WAS
ORIGNALLY
PLANNED
OUT
AS
SPACEWALKS
NOW
THEY
ARE
AT
EVAS
WITH
RESERVE
WALKS
IF
THE
SMT
CAN
AVOID
A
SECOND
SERVICING
MISSION
THATS
MILLION
SAVED
IF
THE
WEIGHT
SAVINGS
MEANS
THEY
CAN
SIT
ON
ORBIT
FOR
DAYS
AND
HANDLE
ANY
CONTINGENCY
PROBLEMS
THATS
QUITE
A
SAVINGS
ACCORDING
TO
A
GAO
REPORT
ON
THE
OMV
I
HAVE
BEFORE
ME
THERE
ARE
ONLY
TWO
CURRENTLY
PLANNED
MISSIONS
THAT
COULD
USE
SUCH
A
VEHICLE
HST
AND
AXAF
SINCE
AXAF
HAS
SINCE
BEEN
SCALED
BACK
AND
HST
CAN
RELY
ON
THE
SHUTTLE
THERE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
ANY
NEED
FOR
YOUR
VEHICLE
OF
COURSE
THERE
WASNT
ANY
NEED
FOR
THE
SATURN
V
AFTER
APOLLO
TOO
AS
FOR
THE
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
APERTURE
DOOR
I
AM
SURE
THEY
CAN
WORK
OUT
SOME
WAY
TO
HANDLE
THAT
MAYBE
A
PLUG
MADE
FROM
FROZEN
ICE
ITLL
KEEP
OUT
ANY
CONTAMINATION
YET
SUBLIME
AWAY
AFTER
TEH
BOOST
