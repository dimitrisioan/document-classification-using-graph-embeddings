SERVICING
MISSION
SCHEDULED
FOR
DAYS
REGARDING
THE
FEASABILITY
OF
RETRIEVING
THE
HST
FOR
REPAIR
AND
RELAUNCHING
IT
CAUTION
SPECULATION
MODE
ENGAGED
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
CONSIDERATION
THAT
HASNT
BEEN
MENTIONED
YET
I
EXPECT
THAT
RETRIEVING
HST
WOULD
INVOLVE
DAMAGING
IT
CONSIDERABLY
IN
ORDER
TO
RETURN
IT
TO
ITS
CRADLE
IN
THE
CARGO
BAY
MOST
OF
THE
DEPLOYED
ITEMS
ANTENNAS
AND
ESPECIALLY
THE
SOLAR
ARAYS
PROBABLY
ARE
NOT
RETRACTABLE
INTO
THEIR
FULLY
STOWED
POSITION
EVEN
BY
HAND
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
REMOVED
BY
THE
ASTRONAUTS
THE
ONLY
ADVANTAGE
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
YIELD
IS
THAT
WE
COULD
PUT
NEW
PANELS
ON
THAT
DONT
RING
DUE
TO
THERMAL
CYCLE
STRESSES
I
ALSO
EXPECT
THAT
AS
HAS
BEEN
DISCUSSED
THE
LANDING
LOADS
ON
THE
HST
OPTICS
STRUCTURE
IS
A
BIG
ISSUE
BUT
THAT
THE
REENTRY
LOADS
ARE
MUCH
LESS
SO
CAN
THE
MOVEABLE
OPTICAL
COMPONENTS
EVEN
BE
RECAGED
I
ASSUME
THAT
THEY
WERE
CAGED

LAUNCH
