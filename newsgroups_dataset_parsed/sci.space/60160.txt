rip
any
comments
on
the
absorbtion
of
the
office
of
exploration
into
the
office
of
space
sciences
and
the
reassignment
of
griffin
to
the
chief
engineer
position
is
this
just
a
meaningless
administrative
shuffle
or
does
this
bode
ill
for
sei
in
my
opinion
this
seems
like
a
bad
thing
at
least
on
the
surface
griffin
seemed
to
be
someone
who
was
actually
interested
in
getting
things
done
and
who
was
willing
to
look
an
innovative
approaches
to
getting
things
done
faster
better
and
cheaper
its
unclear
to
me
whether
he
will
be
able
to
do
this
at
his
new
position
does
anyone
know
what
his
new
duties
will
be
