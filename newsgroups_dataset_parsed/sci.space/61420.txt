positional
stuff
writes
actually
my
advisor
another
classmate
of
mine
and
me
were
talking
the
other
day
about
putting
just
one
detector
on
one
of
the
pluto
satellites
then
we
realized
that
the
satellite
alone
is
only
carrying
something
like
pounds
of
eq
well
a
batse
detector
needs
lead
shielding
to
protect
it
and
alone
weighs
about
pounds
itself
we
decided
against
it
jeremy
are
you
talking
about
a
single
batse
component
or
the
whole
thing
you
could
propose
a
batse
probe
launch
two
or
three
with
ion
drive
on
various
planetary
trajectories
your
resolution
increaces
the
more
theyre
spaced
apart
you
could
probably
cheaply
eject
them
from
the
solar
system
with
enough
flybys
and
patience
things
would
start
out
slow
then
slowly
get
better
and
better
resolution
phil
fraering
seems
like
every
day
we
find
out
all
sorts
of
stuff
how
the
ancient
mayans
had
televison
repo
man
