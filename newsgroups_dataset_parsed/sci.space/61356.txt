RE
WHAT
PLANETS
ARE
HABITABLE
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
THOUGHTS
ON
WHAT
MAKES
A
PLANET
HABITABLE
FOR
HUMANS
I
AM
MAKING
ASUMPTIONS
THAT
LIFE
AND
A
SIMILAR
ATMOSPHERE
EVOLVE
GIVEN
A
RANGE
OF
PHYSICAL
ASPECTS
OF
THE
PLANET
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
PHYSICAL
ASPECTS
SIMPLY
DISALLOW
EARTH
LIKE
CONDITIONS
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
QUESTION
THERE
ARE
MAJOR
BLIND
SPOTS
IN
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
WHAT
MAKES
THE
EARTH
HABITABLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
DOES
THE
EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE
HAVE
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
OXYGEN
IT
DOES
THE
NAIVE
ANSWER
IS
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
BUT
THIS
IS
CLEARLY
INCOMPLETE
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
BY
ITSELF
CANT
MAKE
THE
ATMOSPHERE
OXYGENATED
AS
THE
OXYGEN
PRODUCED
IS
CONSUMED
WHEN
THE
PLANTS
DECAY
OR
ARE
EATEN
WHAT
IS
NEEDED
IS
PHOTOSYNTHESIS
PLUS
SOME
MECHANISM
TO
SEQUESTER
SOME
FRACTION
OF
THE
RESULTING
REDUCED
MATERIAL
ON
EARTH
THIS
MECHANISM
IS
BURIAL
IN
SEAFLOOR
SEDIMENTS
OF
ORGANIC
MATTER
MOSTLY
FROM
OCEANIC
SOURCES
HOWEVER
THIS
BURIAL
REQUIRES
CONTINENTAL
SEDIMENTS
IN
THE
DEEP
OCEAN
THE
BURIAL
RATE
IS
SO
SLOW
THAT
MOST
MATERIAL
IS
CONSUMED
BEFORE
IT
CAN
BE
SEQUESTERED
THIS
SUGGESTS
THAT
A
PLANET
WITHOUT
LARGE
OCEANS
OR
A
PLANET
WITHOUT
CONTINENTS
UNDERGOING
WEATHERING
WILL
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
ACCUMULATING
AN
OXYGEN
ATMOSPHERE
IN
PARTICULAR
AN
ALLOCEAN
PLANET
MAY
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
SUPPORTING
AN
OXYGEN
ATMOSPHERE
THERE
IS
ALSO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
WHY
THE
OXYGEN
IN
THE
EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE
HAS
BEEN
RELATIVELY
STABLE
OVER
GEOLOGICAL
TIME
FOR
A
PERIOD
AT
LEAST
ORDERS
OF
MAGNITUDE
LONGER
THAN
THE
DECAY
TIME
OF
ATMOSPHERIC
TO
WEATHERING
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
REPLENISHMENT
NO
CONVINCING
FEEDBACK
MECHANISM
HAS
BEEN
IDENTIFIED
PERHAPS
THE
REASON
IS
THE
WEAK
ANTHROPIC
PRINCIPLE
IF
DURING
THE
LAST
MYR
OR
SO
THE
OXYGEN
LEVEL
HAD
DROPPED
TOO
LOW
WE
WOULDNT
BE
HERE
TO
BE
WONDERING
ABOUT
IT
