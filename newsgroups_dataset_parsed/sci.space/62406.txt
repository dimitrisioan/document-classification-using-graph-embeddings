LACK
OF
A
SKELETON
MEANS
THAT
MUSCLES
HAVE
TO
ACTIVELY
RESIST
GRAVITY
AT
ALL
TIMES
ON
LAND
RATHER
THAN
SUPPLYING
ONLY
BALANCING
FORCES
THAT
MEANS
THAT
MUCH
MORE
ENERGY
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
FOR
THE
CREATURE
TO
FUNCTION
THE
BONES
ALSO
SUPPLY
LEVERAGE
POINTS
FOR
PUSHING
AND
LATERAL
MOVEMENT
THATS
WHY
YOU
DONT
FIND
LARGE
ACTIVE
BONELESS
CREATURES
ON
LAND
HYDRAULICS
CAN
MAKE
RIGID
TUBES
NO
ENERGY
REQUIRED
JUST
FOR
SUPPORT
HYDRAULICS
ALSO
ALLOW
A
CREATURE
TO
PRODUCE
LARGE
FORCES
WITH
WEAK
MUSCLES
USING
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
A
HYDRAULIC
JACK
RATHER
THAN
A
LEVER
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
YES
BUT
THINGS
ITS
TRUE
THAT
A
HYDRAULICALLY
PRESSURIZED
TUBE
CAN
BE
SOMEWHAT
MORE
RIGID
THAN
AN
UNPRESSURIZED
TUBE
BUT
EVEN
AT
PSI
LEVELS
A
HYDRAULIC
HOSE
WILL
BEND
RATHER
EASILY
THOUGH
ITS
STRAIGHTON
COMPRESSIVE
STRENGTH
IS
HIGH
AND
ITS
TORSIONAL
RESISTANCE
INCREASE
IS
PRACTICALLY
NIL
ON
THE
OTHER
GRASPING
MEMBER
THERES
NO
DOUBT
THAT
HYDRAULIC
LEVERAGE
EXISTS
IN
NATURE
TREE
ROOTS
ARE
AN
EXAMPLE
GIVEN
TIME
THEY
CAN
SHATTER
CONCRETE
AS
OSMOTIC
PRESSURE
INCREASES
ITS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
ON
LAND
CREATURES
ARE
EITHER
TWO
LEGGED
OR
LEGGED
WITH
TINY
INSECTS
HAVING
OR
LEGS
BUT
NEVER
LEGGED
THOUGH
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
STABLE
CONFIGURATION
IT
CAN
BE
ARGUED
THAT
LEGGED
CREATURES
KANGAROOS
ARE
THE
SPECIFIC
NUMBER
OF
LIMBS
A
CREATURE
HAS
IS
AN
ACCIDENT
OF
EVOLUTION
IT
IS
HARD
TO
MAKE
CHANGES
IN
SOME
STRUCTURES
THE
PANDA
HAS
A
THUMB
PLUS
AS
MANY
FINGERS
AS
ITS
ANCESTORS
FIVE
ON
EACH
HAND
BUT
THE
THUMB
IS
A
MODIFIED
WRISTBONE
RATHER
THAN
A
MODIFIED
FINGER
AND
EXTRA
FINGERS
ARE
MUCH
MORE
COMMON
THAN
EXTRA
LIMBS
ESPECIALLY
FULLYFUNCTIONAL
ONES
KANGAROOS
I
DONT
THINK
SO
IF
YOU
TAKE
THE
VIEW
THAT
THE
TAIL
IS
A
LIMB
THEN
MONKEYS
AND
KANGAROOS
ARE
I
THINK
THE
TAIL
IS
A
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
STRUCTURE
GROSSLY
ENLARGED
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
KANGAROO
BUT
PRIMARILY
STILL
AN
INSTRUMENT
OF
BALANCE
RATHER
THAN
LOCOMOTION
I
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
PANDA
THUMBS
SO
ILL
ASK
IS
IT
OPPOSABLE
THERMODYNAMIC
CONSIDERATIONS
OF
SURFACEVOLUME
RELATIONSHIPS
WOULD
SEEM
TO
DICTATE
THAT
ACTIVE
COMPLEX
CREATURES
STAY
IN
A
SIZE
RANGE
SIMILAR
TO
WHAT
WE
SEE
ABOUT
US
INCH
TALL
INTELLIGENT
ALIENS
SEEM
UNLIKELY
AS
DO
THOSE
MUCH
LARGER
THAN
THE
ELEPHANT
WHY
CANT
A
LEMUR
OR
A
BRONTOSAURUS
BE
INTELLIGENT
YES
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
BRONTOSAURUS
IS
A
MYTHICAL
BEAST
PRODUCED
BY
PUTTING
THE
HEAD
OF
ANOTHER
DINOSAUR
ON
AN
APATOSAURUS
BUT
SO
FAR
SPACE
ALIENS
ARE
ALSO
MYTHICAL
WELL
I
WONT
SAY
FLAT
OUT
THAT
THEY
CANT
BE
INTELLIGENT
BUT
ILL
BRING
A
COUPLE
OF
LINES
OF
ARGUMENT
TO
BEAR
TO
TRY
TO
SHOW
WHY
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
LIKELY
FIRST
LET
ME
SAY
THAT
WHEN
I
SAY
INTELLIGENT
I
MEAN
COMPLEX
BEHAVIORS
IN
RESPONSE
TO
NOVEL
SITUATIONS
ON
A
LEVEL
WITH
OR
GREATER
THAN
HUMAN
TOOL
USE
AND
TOOL
BUILDING
IE
ASSUMING
SUITABLE
MANIPULATORS
ARE
PRESENT
ON
THE
CREATURE
TO
ALLOW
IT
TO
ALTER
ITS
ENVIROMENT
IN
A
PLANNED
WAY
IT
WILL
DO
SO
THATS
CERTAINLY
NOT
A
UNIVERSAL
OR
COMPLETE
DEFINITION
OF
INTELLIGENCE
BUT
IT
WILL
SUFFICE
FOR
A
PUTATIVE
TECHNOLOGICAL
ALIEN
NOW
NO
ONE
KNOWS
EXACTLY
WHAT
MAKES
A
BRAIN
CAPABLE
OF
THOUGHT
BUT
ITS
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
CRITERIA
IS
A
CERTAIN
LEVEL
OF
COMPLEXITY
THIS
IS
GENERALLY
DETERMINED
BY
THE
NUMBER
OF
NEURON
CELLS
AND
THEIR
INTERCONNECTIONS
SO
A
CREATURE
THE
SIZE
OF
A
LEMUR
WOULDNT
HAVE
ENOUGH
NEURONS
TO
SUPPORT
COMPLEX
THOUGHT
THIS
ARGUMENT
IS
CONSIDERABLY
LESS
CLEAR
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
DINOSAUR
THERES
ROOM
FOR
A
LARGE
BRAIN
THOUGH
NO
INDICATION
THAT
ONE
EVER
DEVELOPED
ONE
REASON
THIS
MAY
BE
TRUE
IS
NEURONIC
SPEED
THE
ELECTROCHEMICAL
MESSAGES
THAT
TRIGGER
NEURONS
REQUIRE
TIME
TO
PROPAGATE
THIS
MAKES
IT
DIFFICULT
FOR
A
HIGHLY
COMPLEX
CENTRAL
BRAIN
TO
COORDINATE
THE
MOVEMENTS
OF
VERY
LARGE
CREATURES
SO
THERES
LITTLE
SELECTION
PRESSURE
FOR
SUCH
BRAINS
INSTEAD
A
SIMPLER
DISTRIBUTED
NETWORK
EVOLVES
THIS
DOESNT
RULE
OUT
INTELLIGENT
DINOSAURS
BUT
IT
POINTS
IN
THAT
DIRECTION
THEN
THERE
ARE
THE
THERMODYNAMIC
ARGUMENTS
A
TINY
CREATURE
LIKE
THE
LEMUR
NEEDS
TO
EAT
FREQUENTLY
BECAUSE
ITS
INTERNAL
HEAT
IS
RAPIDLY
LOST
DUE
TO
ITS
HIGH
SURFACE
TO
VOLUME
RATIO
I
CONTEND
THAT
A
CREATURE
THAT
MUST
SPEND
MOST
OF
ITS
TIME
AND
ENERGY
FEEDING
WONT
HAVE
THE
TIME
TO
DEVELOP
AND
EXERCISE
INTELLIGENCE
THAT
ARGUMENT
MAY
BE
SOMEWHAT
WEAK
THE
DINOSAURS
PROBLEM
IS
THE
REVERSE
IT
MUST
MODERATE
ITS
HEAT
PRODUCTION
BECAUSE
ITS
HIGH
VOLUME
TO
SURFACE
RATIO
MAKES
IT
TEND
TO
RETAIN
WASTE
HEAT
IM
ASSUMING
THAT
A
CERTAIN
TEMPERATURE
RANGE
IS
OPTIMAL
FOR
CHEMICAL
REACTIVITY
REASONS
FOR
PRODUCTIVE
NEURON
FUNCTION
SO
CREATURES
WOULD
TEND
TO
NEED
TO
MAINTAIN
A
REGULATED
TEMPERATURE
IN
A
RANGE
NEAR
THAT
OF
HUMANS
IF
THEY
ARE
CARBON
BASED
THAT
TENDS
TO
RULE
OUT
COLD
BLOODED
CREATURES
AS
POTENTIAL
HOMES
OF
INTELLIGENCE
SOME
PEOPLE
CONTEND
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
DINOSAURS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
WARM
BLOODED
BUT
FOR
A
CREATURE
THE
SIZE
OF
A
BRONTOSAUR
ITS
ACTIVITY
LEVELS
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
RESTRAINED
OR
IT
WOULD
BE
PRONE
TO
GENERATE
AN
INTERNAL
STEAM
EXPLOSION
FROM
THE
WASTE
HEAT
WHALES
ARE
SIMILAR
SIZE
BUT
THEY
CAN
REJECT
HEAT
TO
THE
OCEAN
A
MUCH
MORE
EFFICIENT
SINK
THAN
AIR
I
SUSPECT
THAT
FOR
INTELLIGENCE
TO
MANIFEST
ITSELF
A
CERTAIN
DEGREE
OF
ACTIVITY
IN
INTERACTING
WITH
THE
ENVIRONMENT
IS
NECESSARY
IE
MONKEY
CURIOUSITY
I
DOUBT
A
LARGE
DINOSAUR
WOULD
BE
CAPABLE
OF
THAT
MUCH
ACTIVITY
