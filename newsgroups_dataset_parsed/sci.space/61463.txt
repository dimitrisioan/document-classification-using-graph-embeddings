why
not
build
a
inflatable
space
dock
if
youre
doing
largescale
satellite
servicing
being
able
to
do
it
in
a
pressurized
hangar
makes
considerable
sense
the
question
is
whether
anyone
is
going
to
be
doing
largescale
satellite
servicing
in
the
near
future
to
the
point
of
justifying
development
of
such
a
thing
inflate
the
dock
with
a
gas
is
does
not
have
to
be
oxygen
just
neeeds
to
be
nonflameble
nondamaging
to
the
satellite
and
abel
to
maintain
heat
youd
almost
certainly
use
air
given
that
you
have
to
pressurize
with
something
safety
considerations
strongly
suggest
making
it
breathable
even
if
the
servicing
crew
is
using
oxygen
masks
for
normal
breathing
to
avoid
needing
a
ventilation
system
its
nice
if
the
hangar
atmosphere
is
breathable
in
a
pinch
it
makes
mask
functioning
much
less
critical
resembles
a
highspeed
collision
