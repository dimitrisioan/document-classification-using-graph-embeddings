re
gamma
ray
bursters
where
are
they
from
graydon
saundrsgqucdnqueensuca
if
all
of
these
things
have
been
detected
in
space
has
anyone
looked
into
possible
problems
with
the
detectors
that
is
is
there
some
mechanism
cosmic
rays
whatever
that
could
cause
the
dector
to
think
it
was
seeing
one
of
these
things
graydon
that
would
not
explain
why
widely
separated
detectors
such
as
on
ulysses
and
pvo
and
ginga
et
al
would
see
a
burst
at
the
same
time
in
fact
be
fore
batse
having
this
widely
separated
interplanetary
network
was
the
only
sure
way
to
locate
a
random
burst
with
only
one
detector
one
cannot
locate
a
burst
except
to
say
its
somewhere
in
the
field
of
view
with
two
detectors
one
can
use
the
time
that
the
burst
is
seen
in
each
detector
to
narrow
the
location
to
a
thin
annulus
on
the
sky
with
three
detectors
one
gets
intersecting
annuli
giving
two
possible
locations
if
one
of
these
locations
is
impossible
because
say
the
earth
blocked
that
part
of
the
sky
voila
you
have
an
error
box
batse
by
having
detectors
of
its
own
can
do
its
own
location
determination
but
only
to
within
about
degrees
would
someone
at
gsfc
like
david
like
to
comment
on
the
current
state
of
location
determination
having
inde
pendent
sightings
by
other
detectors
helps
drive
down
the
uncertainty
you
did
touch
on
something
that
you
didnt
mean
to
though
some
believe
in
a
reference
that
i
have
somewhere
that
absorptionlike
features
seen
in
a
fraction
of
grbs
can
actually
be
caused
by
the
detector
it
would
be
a
mean
nasty
god
though
that
would
have
a
nai
crystal
act
like
a
gauss
neutron
starbut
this
is
getting
too
far
afield
