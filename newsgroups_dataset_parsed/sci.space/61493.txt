did
not
acquire
the
expected
mars
observer
spacecraft
signal
at
the
scheduled
beginning
of
track
yesterday
morning
at
approximately
am
indications
were
that
the
spacecraft
had
entered
a
fault
protection
mode
sometime
between
that
time
and
receipt
of
normal
telemetry
at
the
end
of
the
previous
station
pass
goldstone
meter
antenna
at
approximately
pm
the
evening
before
entry
into
contingency
mode
was
verified
when
signal
was
reacquired
and
telemetry
indicated
that
the
spacecraft
was
sun
coning
after
subsystem
engineers
reported
all
systems
performing
nominally
fault
protection
telemetry
modes
were
reconfigured
and
memory
readouts
of
command
system
audit
queue
and
aacs
attitude
and
articulation
control
subsystem
starex
performed
these
readouts
verified
that
contingency
mode
entry
occurred
shortly
after
am
yesterday
preliminary
indications
are
that
a
sun
ephemeris
check
failure
triggered
fault
protection
however
the
flight
team
will
be
determining
the
precise
cause
over
the
next
few
days
as
of
last
evening
the
spacecraft
had
been
commanded
back
to
inertial
reference
and
was
stable
in
that
mode
the
flight
team
is
planning
to
command
the
spacecraft
back
to
array
normal
spin
state
today
magnetometer
calibration
activities
had
completed
prior
to
contingency

entry
mag
calibration
data
has
been
recorded
on

and
playback
of

and
scheduled
to
be
completed
yesterday
was
postponed
when
contingency

entry
halted
flight
sequence
execution
the
flight
team
is
developing
a
strategy
to
restart
to
complete

present
planning
is
to
perform
playbacks
between
as
soon
as
wednesday
or
as
late
as
friday
of
next
week
dependent
on
contingency
