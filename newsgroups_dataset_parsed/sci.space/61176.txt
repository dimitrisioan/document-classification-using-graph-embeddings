GALILEOS
HGA
IS
STUCK
THE
HGA
WAS
LEFT
CLOSED
BECAUSE
GALILEO
HAD
A
VENUS
FLYBY
IF
THE
HGA
WERE
POINTED
ATT
HE
SUN
NEAR
VENUS
IT
WOULD
COOK
THE
FOCI
ELEMENTS
QUESTION
WHY
COULDNT
GALILEOS
COURSE
MANUEVERS
HAVE
BEEN
DESIGNED
SUCH
THAT
THE
HGA
DID
NOT
EVER
DO
A
SUN
POINT
THE
HGA
ISNT
ALL
THAT
REFLECTIVE
IN
THE
WAVELENGTHS
THAT
MIGHT
COOK
THE
FOCAL
ELEMENTS
NOR
IS
ITS
FIGURE
GOOD
ON
THOSE
SCALESTHE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
ANTENNA
ITSELF
COULD
NOT
BE
EXPOSED
TO
VENUSLEVEL
SUNLIGHT
LEST
LIKE
ICARUS
WINGS
IT
MELT
I
THINK
IT
WAS
GLUES
AND
SUCH
AS
WELL
AS
ELECTRONICS
THAT
THEY
WERE
WORRIED
ABOUT
THUS
IT
HAD
TO
REMAIN
FURLED
AND
THE
AXIS
ALWAYS
POINTED
NEAR
THE
SUN
SO
THAT
THE
SMALL
SUNSHADE
AT
THE
TIP
OF
THE
ANTENNA
MAST
WOULD
SHADOW
THE
FOLDED
HGA
A
LARGER

BENEATH
