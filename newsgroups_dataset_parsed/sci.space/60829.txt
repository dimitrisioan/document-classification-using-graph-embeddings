THE
OLD
DAYS
THEIR
USED
TO
BE
ARBITRON
STATS
THAT
ANALYZED
THE
READERSHIP
AND
POSTING
VOLUMES
BY
GROUP
AND
USER
THEY
WERE
AVAILABLE
FROM
UUNET
THATS
HOW
YOU
CHECK
THE
READERSHIP
OF
SCISPACE
NOT
SOME
STUPID
UNSCIENTIFIC
ATTEMPT
TO
FLOOD
THE
NEWSGROUP
I
HAVE
ABETTER
IDEA
WHY
DONT
WE
ALL
REPLY
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
ORIGANATOR
OF
THIS
POST
AND
TELL
HIM
WE
READ
SCISPACE
PAT
SIGH
I
TRY
TO
MAKE
A
LITTLE
JOKE
I
TRY
TO
INJECT
SOME
HUMOUR
HERE
AND
WHAT
HAPPENS
IN
THE
IMMORTAL
WORDS
OF
FOGHORN
LEGHORN
I
SAY
THAT
WAS
A
JOKE
SON
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
BIT
ABOUT
MCELWAINE
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
TWO
SMILEYS
WOULD
INDICATE
TO
EVEN
THE
MOST
HUMOUR
IMPAIRED
THAT
I
WAS
JOKING
SIGH
AND
WILL
EVERYONE
WHO

THANKS

RBORDENRAUVICCA
NOW
I
HAD
PUT
A
WINK
AT
THE
END
OF
MY
SUGGESTION
INDICATING

INTENSELY
SARCASTIC
I
CANT
HELP
IT
IF

GOT
ALL
SERIOUS
ROSS
I
NEVER
SAW
YOUR
ORIGINAL
POSTING
IT
DROPPED
ON
THE
FLOOR
SOMEWHERE
I
JUST
SAW
THE
TRICKLE
DOWN
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
INTENSELY
STUPID
NOT
KNOWING
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
JOKE
MENTIONED
ARBITRON
AND
LEFT
IT
WITH
AN
EQUALLY
STUPID
JOKE
BILL
IN
HIS
EVER
INCREASING
DEVOTION
TO
THOROUGHNESS
DUG
UP
SEVERAL
ARBITRON
STATS
I
MYSELF
THINK
THE
ARBITRON
STATS
ARE
SEVERELY
METHODOLOGICALLY
IMPAIRED
BUT
ARE
A
GOOD
MEASURE
OF
PROPORTION
I
DONT
THINK
ANYONE
KNOWS
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
READ
