RE
HST
SERVICING
MISSION
SCHEDULED
FOR
DAYS
IN
ARTICLE
HATHAWAYSTSCIEDU
WRITES
AFTER
ALL
THE
SPACE
WALKING
THEY
ARE
GOING
TO
REBOOST
THE
HSTS
ORBIT
I
THINK
RIGHT
NOW
ITS
SITTING
AT
MILES
UP
THEY
WOULD
LIKE
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
EXACT
ORBIT
NUMBERS
AS
BEN
SAYS
THIS
REBOOST
IDEA
IS
ALL
NEWS
TO
US
HERE
DO
YOU
KNOW
SOMETHING
WE
DONT
PLEASE
SUPPLY
A
SOURCE
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
FOR
THE
SCHEDULERS
OF
OBSERVATIONS
TO
KNOW
WHERE
THE
THING
IS
GOING
TO
BE
THESE
ALTITUDE
NUMBERS
ARE
ALSO
WAY
OFF
MY
BEST
SOURCE
HAS
MINIMUM
ST
ALTITUDE
IN
THE
PMDB
IS
KILOMETERS
MAXIMUM
ST
ALTITUDE
IN
THE
PMDB
IS
KILOMETERS
DELTA
ST
ALTITUDE
IN
THE
PMDB
IS
KILOMETERS
PMDB
IS
PROPOSAL
MANAGEMENT
DATA
BASE
USED
TO
SCHEDULE
OBSERVATIONS
I
AM
SURE
YOUR
NUMBERS
ARE
FAR
BETTER
THEN
MINE
AS
I
SAID
ABOVE
I
DONT
HAVE
EXACT
NUMBERS
IN
ORDER
TO
PERFORM
THE
REBOOST
OF
THE
HST
THE
OMS
ENGINES
WILL
BE
FIRED
FOR
A
LONG
PERIOD
NOW
THE
SHUTTLE
IS
A
HEAVY
THING
THE
HST
ISNT
LIGHT
EITHER
THE
AMOUNT
OF
OMS
FUEL
NEEDED
TO
FLY
BOTH
UP
IS
SUBSTANTIAL
A
SMALL
BOOSTER
CARRIED
UP
AND
USED
TO
BOOST
HST
ON
ITS
OWN
WILL
WEIGH
SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS
THEN
THE
OMS
FUEL
REQUIRED
TO
BOOST
BOTH
HST
AND
SHUTTLE
FOR
A
GIVEN
ORBITAL
CHANGE
COULD
YOU
SUPPLY
SOME
CALCULATIONS
YOU
MIGHT
CHECK
SOME
RECENT
POSTINGS
THAT
EXPLAINED
THAT
A
SMALL
BOOSTER
AS
SUGGESTED
DOES
NOT
NOW
EXIST
SO
COMPARING
THE
MASS
OF
SOMETHING
THAT
DOESNT
EXIST
TO
THE
MASS
OF
THE
OMS
FUEL
SEEMS
IMPOSSIBLE
THE
CONTAMINATION
THREAT
ALSO
REMAINS
HOW
DIFFERENT
WOULD
THE
CONTAMINATION
THREAT
OF
A
SMALL
MANUEVERING
TUG
BE
FROM
THAT
OF
THE
SHUTTLE
AND
ITS
OMS
ENGINES
I
KNOW
THAT
NO
SMALL
MANUEVERING
TUG
EXISTS
BUT
MAYBE
ONE
COULD
SOUP
UP
A
BUS
DOES
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HAVE
THE
DECLASIFIED
SPECS
ON
HTE
BUS
WOULD
IT
BE
ABLE
TO
PROVIDE
ENOUGH
CONTROL
FORCE
TO
BALANCE
THE
HST
AND
STILL
HAVE
THE
ROCKET
THRUST
TO
HURL
HER
INTO
A
DECENT
HIGH
ORBIT
OR
THE
HST
COULD
EVEN
GET
PLACED
INTO
SOME
SORT
OF
MEDIUM
ORBIT
THE
REASON
THEY
WANT
A
HIGH
ORBIT
IS
LESS
ANTENNA
POINTING
AND
LONGER
DRAG
LIFE
LONGER
DRAG
LIFE
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
BUT
COULD
YOU
EXPLAIN
THE
ANTENNA
POINTING
SORRY
THAT
SHOULD
BE
INTRUMENT
POINTING
WHATEVER
IT
IS
THE
PROBLEM
IN
THE
TILT
ARRAY
IS
A
BIG
CONSTRAINT
ON
HST
OPS
TELL
ME
ABOUT
IT
ALTHOUGH
THE
ARRAYS
CAN
BE
AND
ARE
MOVED
PERFECTLY
WELL
UTILIZING
THE
SECOND
ELECTRONICS
BOX
GETTING
THEM
BOTH
WORKING
IS
MUCH
DESIREABLE
SO
AS
TO
RECLAIM
REDUNDANCY
PLUS
IF
THE
SECOND
BOX
GETS
FRITZY
YOU
COULD
BE
IN
SHITTER
VILLE
REAL
FAST
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
JUMP
ON
YOU
HELPFUL
SUGGESTIONS
ARE
ALWAYS
WELCOME
AND
WE
ALL
KNOW
THE
MORE
IDEAS
THE
BETTER
BUT
I
DO
WANT
THE
TRUE
SITUATION
TO
BE
DESCRIBED
CLEARLY
AND
CORRECTLY
LEST
SOME
GET
CONFUSED
REGARDS
WM
HATHAWAY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOONE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
THE
EXACT
NUMBERS
WHEN
THE
MISSION
WAS
PLANNED
ORIGINALLY
AT
SPACEWALKS
AND
ASTRONAUTS
THERE
WAS
ENORMOUS
CONCERN
OVER
THE
MASS
MARGINS
FOR
THE
FLIGHT
THEY
HAVE
NOW
PLANNED
FOR
EVAS
AN
DAY
MISSION
AND
HAVE
RESERVE
EVAS
AND
AN
EMERGENCY
EVA
OBVIOUSLY
THAT
IS
COMING
FROM
SOMEWHERE
MY
GUESS
IS
THE
OMS
BURN
FUEL
OR
REBOOST
MARGIN
I
JUST
FIGURED
IF
GOLDIN
WANTS
TO
REALLY
PROVE
OUT
FASTER
CHEAPER
BETTER
HAVE
SOME
OF
THE
WHIZ
KIDS
SLAP
TOGETHER
AN
EXPENDABLE
SPACE
MANUEVERING
TUG
OUT
OF
A
AND
USE
THAT
FOR
THE
REBOOST
IT
HAS
TO
BE
BETTER
THEN
USING
THE
DISCOVERY
AS
A
TOW
TRUCK
PAT
