i
think
if
there
is
to
be
a
prize
and
such
there
should
be
classes
such
as
the
following
large
corp
small
corpcompany
based
on
reported
earnings
large
government
gnp
and
such
small
governemtn
or
political
clout
or
gnp
large
organization
planetary
society
and
such
small
organization
alot
of
small
orgs
whatabout
schools
universities
rich
individuals
around
people
in
the
uk
have
more
than
million
dollars
each
i
reecieved
mail
from
people
who
claimed
they
might
get
a
person
into
space
for
per
pound
send
a
skinny
person
into
space
and
split
the
rest
of
the
money
among
the
ground
crew
the
organization
things
would
probably
have
to
be
nonprofit
or
liek
of
course
this
means
the
prize
might
go
up
larger
get
more
or
basically
make
the
prize
total
purse
billion
divided
amngst
the
class
winners
more
fair
there
would
have
to
be
a
seperate
organization
set
up
to
monitor
the
events
umpire
and
such
and
watch
for
safety
violations
or
maybe
not
if
peopel
want
to
risk
thier
own
lives
let
them
do
it
agreed
i
volunteer
for
any
uk
attempts
but
one
clause
no
launch
methods
which
are
clearly
dangerous
to
the
environment
ours
or
someone
elses
no
usage
of
materials
from
areas
of
planetary
importance
any
other
ideas
yes
we
should
do
this
rather
than
talk
about
it
lobby
people
the
major
problem
with
the
space
programmes
is
all
talkpaperwork
and
no
action

and
they
shall
not
find
those
things
with
a
sort
of
rafia
like
base
that
their
fathers
put
there
just
the
night
before
at
about
oclock
