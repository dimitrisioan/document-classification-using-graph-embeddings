AEROSPACE
COMPANIES
COOPERATE
IN
REUSABLE
VEHICLE
MARKET
WHAT
WOULD
ALL
OF
YOU
OUT
THERE
IN
NET
LAND
THINK
OF
THE
BIG
MARTIN
MARIATTA
BOEING
MCDONELL
DOUGLAS
GENERAL
DYNAMICS
LOCKHEED
ROCKWELL
GETTING
TOGETHER
AND
FORMING
A
CONSORTIUM
TO
STUDY
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
MARKET
PRICE
PINTS
ARE
FOR
BUILDING
REUSABLE
LAUNCH
VEHICLES
AND
SPENDING
SAY
TO
DO
THAT
RECOGNIZING
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
MILITARY
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
LAUNCH
VEHICLES
ARE
PULLED
OUT
OF
A
HAT
SOMEWHERE
SAY
HAS
THE
SHUTTLE
EVER
REALLY
USED
THAT
CROSSRANGE
CAPABILITY
YOU
GET
THE
IDEA
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
MANY
HOW
OFTEN
WHERE
TO
ETC
THEN
TAKING
THIS
DATA
AND
FORMING
A
SEMATECH
TYPE
COMPANY
BAD
EXAMPLE
I
KNOW
BUT
AT
LEAST
ITS
AN
EXAMPLE
TO
DEVELOP
BETWEEN
AND
CRAFT
DESIGNS
THEN
TO
TAKE
ALL
OF
THOSE
DESIGNS
AND
FIGURE
OUT
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
TECHNOLOGIES
ARE
AND
DEMONSTRATE
THOSE
TECHNOLOGIES
IN
ORDER
TO
ELIMINATE
DESIGNS
THAT
CANT
BE
BUILT
TODAY
AND
LETS
SAY
THAT
THIS
PORTION
AGAIN
FUNDED
BY
THE
GOV
COST
ABOUT
MILLION
AND
FROM
HERE
ALL
OF
THESE
COMPANIES
WENT
THEIR
SEPARATE
WAYS
WITH
THE
INTENTION
OF
TAKING
ALL
OF
THE
MARKET
DATA
AND
THE
DESIGN
DATA
TO
WALL
STREET
AND
SAYING
I
WANT
TO
BUILD
THIS
VEHICLE
AND
HERE
ARE
THE
NUMBERS
THAT
SHOW
ROI
FUND
ME
NOW
MANY
OF
YOU
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
A
JOKE
BUT
I
HAVE
IT
ON
GOOD
AUTHORITY
THAT
JUST
THIS
PROJECT
IS
SHAPING
UP
IN
THE
BACKGROUND
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
AEROSPACE
COMPANIES
HAVE
LEARNED
THAT
EVERYONE
YELLING
SIMILAR
BUT
DIFFERENT
THINGS
ENDS
UP
IN
MANY
PROGRAMS
THAT
DO
NOTHING
MUCH
AND
GET
CANCELED
NASP
NLS
ALS
DCY
ETC
THEY
NEED
TO
WORK
MORE
IN
THE
JAPANEESE
AND
EUROPEAN
SPIRIT
OF
INITIAL
COOPERATION
THEY
HAVE
ALSO
LEARNED
THAT
DESIGN
REQUIREMENTS
THAT
ARE
PHONY
IE
SOME
GENERALS
IDEA
OF
WHAT
A
SPACE
VEHICLE
OUGHT
TO
BE
ENDS
UP
GETTING
CHOPPED
UP
IN
CONGRESS
BECAUSE
IT
IS
NOT
A
REAL
REQUIREMENT
ANY
FEEDBACK
