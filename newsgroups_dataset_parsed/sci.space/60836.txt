oh
that
guy
again
writes
the
gravity
maneuvering
that
was
used
was
to
exploit
fuzzy
regions
these
are
described
by
the
inventor
as
exploiting
the
secondorder
perturbations
in
a
three
body
system
the
probe
was
launched
into
this
region
for
the
earthmoonsun
system
where
the
perturbations
affected
it
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
it
to
go
into
lunar
orbit
without
large
expenditures
of
fuel
to
slow
down
the
idea
is
that
natural
objects
sometimes
get
captured
without
expending
fuel
well
just
find
the
trajectory
that
makes
it
possible
the
originator
of
the
technique
said
that
nasa
wasnt
interested
but
that
japan
was
because
their
probe
was
small
and
couldnt
hold
a
lot
of
fuel
for
deceleration
i
should
probably
repost
this
with
another
title
so
that
the
guys
on
the
other
thread
would
see
that
this
is
a
practical
use
of
temporary
orbits
another
possible
temporary
orbit
phil
fraering
seems
like
every
day
we
find
out
all
sorts
of
stuff
how
the
ancient
mayans
had
