magellan
status
report
april
magellan
has
completed
orbits
of
venus
and
is
now
days
from
the
end
of
and
the
start
of
the
transition
experiment
sorry
i
think
i
missed
a
bit
of
info
on
this
transition
experiment
what
is
it
on
monday
morning
april
the
moon
will
occult
venus
and
interrupt
the
tracking
of
magellan
for
about
minutes
will
this
mean
a
loss
of
data
or
will
the
magellan
transmit
data
later
on
btw
when
will
nasa
cut
off
the
connection
with
magellan
not
that
i
am
looking
forward
to
that
day
but
i
am
just
curious
i
believe
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
funding
from
the
goverment
or
rather
no
funding
ok
thats
it
for
now
see
