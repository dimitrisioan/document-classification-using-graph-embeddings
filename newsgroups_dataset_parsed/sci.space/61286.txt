WHAT
PLANETS
ARE
HABITABLE
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
THOUGHTS
ON
WHAT
MAKES
A
PLANET
HABITABLE
FOR
HUMANS
I
AM
MAKING
ASUMPTIONS
THAT
LIFE
AND
A
SIMILAR
ATMOSPHERE
EVOLVE
GIVEN
A
RANGE
OF
PHYSICAL
ASPECTS
OF
THE
PLANET
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
PHYSICAL
ASPECTS
SIMPLY
DISALLOW
EARTH
LIKE
CONDITIONS
EG
TEMPERATURE
RANGE
OF
TO
WHERE
TEMP
IS
PURELY
DEPENDANT
ON
DIST
FROM
THE
SUN
AND
THE
SUNS
TEMPERATURE
ATMOSPHERIC
PRESURE
I
KNOW
NOTHING
OF
HUMAN
TOLERANCE
PLANETARY
MASS
AGAIN
GRAVITY
AT
SURFACE
IS
IMPORTANT
HOW
MUCH
CAN
HUMAN
BODIES
TAKE
DAY
AFTER
DAY
ALSO
HOW
DOES
THE
MASS
EFFECT
ATMOSPHERE
I
THINKING
OF
PLANETS
BETWEEN
AND
TIMES
MASS
OF
THE
EARTH
I
SUPPOSE
DENSITY
SHOULD
BE
IMPORTANT
AS
WELL
CLIMATE
ETC
DOES
NOT
CONCERN
ME
NOR
DOES
AXIAL
TILT
ETC
ETC
JUST
THE
ABOVE
THREE
FACTORS
AND
HOW
THEY
RELATE
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
JONATHAN
WITH
FEARSOME
EYES
AND
FIERY
BREATH
THE
DRAGON
BURNT
THE
GIRL
TO
DEATH
FROM
TOO
LATE
