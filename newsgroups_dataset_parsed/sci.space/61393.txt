i
want
to
know
what
weightlessness
actually
feels
like
for
example
is
there
a
constant
sensation
of
falling
yes
weightlessness
does
feel
like
falling
it
may
feel
strange
at
first
but
the
body
does
adjust
the
feeling
is
not
too
different
from
that
of
sky
diving
and
what
is
the
motion
sickness
that
some
astronauts
occasionally
experience
it
is
the
bodys
reaction
to
a
strange
environment
it
appears
to
be
induced
partly
to
physical
discomfort
and
part
to
mental
distress
some
people
are
more
prone
to
it
than
others
like
some
people
are
more
prone
to
get
sick
on
a
roller
coaster
ride
than
others
the
mental
part
is
usually
induced
by
a
lack
of
clear
indication
of
which
way
is
up
or
down
ie
the
shuttle
is
normally
oriented
with
its
cargo
bay
pointed
towards
earth
so
the
earth
or
ground
is
above
the
head
of
the
astronauts
about
of
the
astronauts
experience
some
form
of
motion
sickness
and
nasa
has
done
numerous
tests
in
space
to
try
to
see
how
to
keep
the
number
of
occurances
