introduction
in
order
to
increase
public
interest
in
spacebased
and
lunar
operations
a
real
miniature
lunarlike
environment
is
being
constructed
on
which
to
test
teleoperated
models
these
models
are
remotelycontrolled
by
individuals
located
worldwide
using
their
personal
computers
for
edutainment
purposes
not
only
does
this
provide
a
testbed
for
simple
teleoperation
and
telepresence
activities
but
it
also
provides
for
the
sharing
of
information
on
methods
of
operating
in
space
including
but
not
limited
to
layout
of
a
lunar
colony
teleoperating
machines
for
work
and
play
disseminating
educational
information
providing
contests
and
awards
for
creativity
and
achievement
and
provides
a
new
way
for
students
worldwide
to
participate
in
twentyfirst
century
remote
learning
methods
because
of
the
nature
of
the
project
people
of
all
ages
interests
and
skills
can
contribute
scenery
and
murals
models
and
structures
interfacing
and
electronics
software
and
graphics
in
operation
is
an
evolving
playground
and
laboratory
that
can
be
used
by
children
students
and
professionals
worldwide
using
a
personal
computer
at
home
or
a
terminal
at
a
participating
institution
a
user
is
able
to
teleoperate
real
models
at
the
base
for
experimental
or
recreational
purposes
because
a
real
facility
exists
ample
opportunity
is
provided
for
media
coverage
of
the
construction
of
the
lunar
model
its
operation
and
new
features
to
be
added
as
suggested
by
the
users
themselves
this
has
broad
inherent
interest
for
a
wide

the

in
all
of
us
overall
design
a
room
feet
by
feet
contains
the
base
lunar
layout
the
walls
are
used
for
murals
of
distant
moon
mountains
star
fields
and
a
view
of
the
earth
the
floor
is
the
simulated
lunar
surface
a
global
call
for
contributions
is
hereby
made
for
material
for
the
lunar
surface
and
for
the
design
and
creation
of
scale
models
of
lunar
colony
elements
scenery
and
machinelets
the
initial
design
has
teleoperated
machinelets
an
ssto
scale
model
which
will
be
able
to
lift
off
hover
and
land
a
bulldozerlet
which
will
be
able
to
move
about
in
a
quarry
area
and
a
moontrain
which
will
traverse
most
of
the
simulated
lunar
surface
each
machinelet
has
a
small
tv
camera
utilizing
a
ccd
tv
chip
mounted
on
it
a
personal
computer
digitizes
the
image
including
reducing
picture
content
and
doing
datacompression
to
allow
for
minimal
images
to
be
sent
to
the
operator
for
control
purposes
and
also
return
control
signals
the
first
machinelet
to
be
set
up
will
be
the
moontrain
since
model
trains
with
tv
cameras
built
in
are
almost
offtheshelf
items
and
control
electronics
for
starting
and
stopping
a
train
are
minimal
the
user
will
receive
an
image
once
every
to
seconds
depending
on
the
speed
of
their
data
link
to
next
an
ssto
scale
model
with
a
ccd
tv
chip
will
be
suspended
from
a
servomotor
operated
wire
frame
mounted
on
the
ceiling
allowing
for
the
ssto
to
be
controlled
by
the
operator
to
take
off
hover
over
the
entire
lunar
landscape
and
land
finally
some
tank
models
will
be
modified
to
be
ccd
tv
chip
equipped
bulldozerlets
the
entire
initial
will
allow
remote
operators
worldwide
to
receive
minimal
images
while
actually
operating
models
for
landing
and
takeoff
traveling
and
doing
work
the
entire
system
is
based
on
commercially
available
items
and
parts
that
can
be
easily
obtained
except
for
the
interface
electronics
which
is
well
within
the
capability
of
many
advanced
ham
radio
operator
and
computer
hardwaresoftware
developers
by
taking
a
graphically
oriented
communications
program
dmodem
and
adding
a
teleoperations
screen
and
controls
the
necessary
user
interface
can
be
provided
in
under
man
hours
plan
of
action
the
diaspar
virtual
reality
network
has
agreed
to
sponsor
this
project
by
providing
a
host
computer
network
and
internet
access
to
that
network
diaspar
is
providing
the
foot
by
foot
facility
for
actual
construction
of
the
lunar
model
diaspar
has
in
stock
the
electronic
tanks
that
can
be
modified
and
one
ccd
tv
chip
diaspar
also
agrees
to
provide
rail
stock
for
the
lunar
train
model
diaspar
will
make
available
the
dmodem
graphical
communications
package
and
modify
it
for
control
of
the
machineslets
an
initial
ground
breaking
with
miniature
shovels
will
be
performed
for
a
live
photosession
and
news
conference
on
april
the
initial
models
will
be
put
in
place
a
timelapse
record
will
be
started
for
historical
purposes
it
is
not
expected
that
this
event
will
be
completely
serious
or
solemn
the
lunar
colony
will
be
declared
open
for
additional
building
operations
and
experiments
a
photographer
will
be
present
and
the
photographs
taken
will
be
converted
to
gif
images
for
distribution
worldwide
to
major
online
networks
and
bbss
a
press
release
will
be
issued
calling
for
contributions
of
ideas
time
talent
materials
and
scale
models
for
the
simulated
lunar
colony
a
contest
for
new
designs
and
techniques
for
working
on
the
moon
will
then
be
announced
universities
will
be
invited
to
participate
the
goal
being
to
find
instructors
who
wish
to
have
class
participation
in
various
aspects
of
the
lunar
colony
model
field
trips
to
can
be
arranged
and
at
that
time
the
results
of
the
class
work
will
be
added
to
the
model
contributors
will
then
be
able
to
teleoperate
any
contributed
machinelets
once
they
return
to
their
campus
a
monthly
newsletter
will
be
issued
both
electronically
online
and
via
conventional
means
to
the
media
any
major
new
teleoperated
equipment
addition
will
be
marked
with
an
invitation
to
the
television
news
media
having
a
large
real
model
space
colony
will
be
a
very
attractive
photo
opportunity
for
the
television
community
especially
since
the
action
will
be
controlled
by
people
all
over
the
world
science
fiction
writers
will
be
invited
to
issue
challenges
to
engineering
and
human
factors
students
at
universities
to
build
and
operate
the
teleoperated
equipment
to
perform
lunar
tasks
using
counterweight
and
pulley
systems
gravity
may
be
simulated
to
some
extent
to
try
various
traction
challenges
the
long
term
goal
is
creating
worldwide
interest
education
experimentation
and
remote
operation
of
a
lunar
colony
has
the
potential
of
being
a
long
term
global
edutainment
method
for
space
activities
and
may
be
the
generic
example
of
how
to
teach
and
explore
in
many
other
subject
areas
not
limited
to
space
edutainment
all
of
this
facilitates
the
kind
of
spirit
which
can
lead
to
a
generation
of
people
who
are
ready
for
the
leap
to
the
stars
conclusion
edutainment
is
the
blending
of
education
and
entertainment
anyone
who
has
ever
enjoyed
seeing
miniatures
will
probably
see
the
potential
impact
of
a
globally
available
layout
for
recreation
education
and
experimentation
purposes
by
creating
a
teleoperated
model
lunar
colony
we
not
only
create
worldwide
publicity
but
also
a
method
of
trying
new
ideas
that
require
real
not
virtual
skills
and
open
a
new
method
for
putting
peoples
minds
in
space
moonlighters
illuminating
the
path
of
knowledge
about
space
and
lunar
development
the
following
people
are
already
engaged

this
work
