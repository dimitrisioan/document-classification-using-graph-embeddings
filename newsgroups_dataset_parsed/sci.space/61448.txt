i
am
taking
a
course
entitled
exploring
science
using
internet
for
our
final
project
we
are
to
find
a
compendium
of
internet
resources
dealing
with
a
sciencerelated
topic
i
chose
astronomy
anyway
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
knew
of
any
interesting
resources
on
internet
that
provide
information
on
astronomy
space
nasa
or
anything
like
that
do
you
know
of
the
worldwideweb
this
is
a
global
hypertext
well
hypermedia
network
running
on
the
internet
one
of
the
nice
things
about
it
is
that
is
understands
and
incorporates
virtually
all
of
the
other
systems
being
used
like
wais
gopher
ftp
archie
etc
it
is
usually
quite
easy
to
add
existing
resources
to
the
web
if
youd
like
to
explore
id
suggest
getting
the
xmosaic
program
written
at
the
ncsa
its
an
xwindows
web
browser
and
is
pretty
slick
it
can
understand
and
cope
with
more
than
text
gif
jpeg
mpeg
audio
etc
there
are
other
browsers
including
a
textmode
browser
for
people
stuck
on
a
text
terminal
but
im
most
familliar
with
mosaic
under
the
page
the
worldwide
web
virtual
library
subject
catalogue
this
is
available
under
the
documents
menu
in
mosaic
or
by
any
browser
via
the
url
httpinfocernchhypertextdatasourcesbysubjectoverviewhtml
there
is
a
subject
space
science
currently
this
points
to
a
page
under
construction
with
only
the
nasa
jpl
ftp
archive
ive
volunteered
to
take
over
this
page
and
in
fact
i
have
a
replacement
with
all
sorts
of
information
pointers
mostly
gleaned
from
the
scispace
faq
as
soon
as
the
overworked
subject
catalogue
maintainer
switches
the
space
science
pointer
itll
be
visible
ill
post
a
short
note
when
this
happens
