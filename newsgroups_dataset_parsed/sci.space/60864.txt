WRITES
I
DONT
CARE
WHO
TOLD
YOU
THIS
IT
IS
NOT
GENERALLY
TRUE
I
SEE
EVERY
SINGLE
LINE
ITEM
ON
A
CONTRACT
AND
I
HAVE
TO
SIGN
IT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
WRAP
AT
THIS
UNIVERSITY
DENNIS
I
HAVE
WORKED
ON
OR
WRITTEN
PROPOSALS
WORTH
TENS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
CUSTOMERS
INCLUDED
GOVERNMENT
INCLUDING
NASA
FOR
PROFIT
AND
NONPROFIT
COMPANIES
ALL
EXPECTED
A
WRAP
USUALLY
CALLED
A
FEE
MUCH
OF
THE
WORK
INVOLVED
ALLOCATING
AND
COSTING
THE
WORK
OF
SUBCONTRACTORS
THE
SUBCONTRACTORS
WHERE
UNIVERSITIES
FORPROFITS
NONPROFITS
AND
EVEN
SOME
OF
THE
NASA
CENTERS
FOR
THE
COMMERCIALIZATION
OF
SPACE
ALL
CHARGED
FEES
AS
PART
OF
THE
WORK
DOWN
THE
STREET
IS
ONE
OF
THE
NASA
COMMERCIALIZATION
CENTERS
THEY
CHARGE
A
FEE
NOW
IM
SURE
YOUR
A
COMPETENT
ENGINEER
DENNIS
BUT
YOU
CLEARLY
LACK
EXPERIENCE
IN
SEVERAL
AREAS
YOUR
POSTS
SHOW
THAT
YOU
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
INTEGRATION
IN
LARGE
PROJECTS
YOU
ALSO
SHOW
A
LACK
OF
UNDERSTANDING
OF
COSTING
EFFORTS
AS
SHOWN
BY
YOUR
BELIEF
THAT
IT
IS
REASONABLE
TO
CHARGE
INCREMENTAL
COSTS
FOR
EVERYTHING
THIS
ISNT
A
FLAME
JSUT
A
STATEMENT
YOUR
EMPLOYER
DOES
CHARGE
A
FEE
YOU
MAY
NOT
SEE
IT
BUT
YOU
DO
SOUNDS
LIKE
THEY
ARE
ADDING
IT
TO
THEIR
OVERHEAD
RATE
GO
ASK
YOUR
COSTING
PEOPLE
HOW
MUCH
FEE
THEY
ADD
TO
A
PROJECT
I
DID
THEY
NEVER
HEARD
OF
IT
BUT
SUGGEST
THAT
LIKE
OUR
PRESIDENT
DID
THAT
ANY
PERCENTAGE
NUMBER
LIKE
THIS
IS
INCLUDED
IN
THE
OVERHEAD
WELL
THERE
YOU
ARE
DENNIS
AS
I
SAID
THEY
SIMPLY
INCLUDE
THE
FEE
IN
THEIR
OVERHEAD
MANY
SEOPARATE
THE
FEE
SINCE
THE
FEE
STRUCTURE
CAN
CHANGE
DEPENDING
ON
THE
CUSTOMER
NO
ALLEN
YOU
DID
NOT
YOU
MERELY
REPEATED
ALLEGATIONS
MADE
BY
AN
EMPLOYEE
OF
THE
OVERHEAD
CAPITAL
OF
NASA
INTEGRATION
DENNIS
ISNT
OVERHEAD
NOTHING
THAT
RESTON
DOES
COULD
NOT
BE
DONT
BETTER
OR
CHEAPER
AT
THE
OTHER
NASA
CENTERS
WHERE
THE
WORK
IS
GOING
ON
DENNIS
RESTON
HAS
BEEN
THE
ONLY
NASA
AGENCY
WORKING
TO
REDUCE
COSTS
WHEN
WP
WAS
HEMORAGING
OUT
A
BILLION
THE
CENTERS
YOU
LOVE
SO
MUCH
WHERE
DOING
THEIR
BEST
TO
COVER
IT
UP
AND
IGNORE
THE
PROBLEM
RESTON
WAS
THE
ONLY
PLACE
YOU
WOULD
FIND
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
INTERESTED
IN
SOLVING
THE
PROBLEMS
AND
BUILDING
A
STATION
KINDA
FUNNY
ISNT
IT
THAT
SOMEONE
WHO
TALKS
ABOUT
A
PROBLEM
LIKE
THIS
IS
AT
A
PLACE
WHERE
EVERYTHING
IS
OVERHEAD
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
A
BIT
MORE
EXPERIENCE
DENNIS
YOU
WILL
REALIZE
THAT
INTEGRATION
ISNT
OVERHEAD
IT
IS
THE
SINGLE
MOST
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
A
SUCCESSFUL
LARGE
SCALE
EFFORT
WHY
DID
THE
SPACE
NEWS
ARTICE
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
CONGRESSIONALLY
DEMANDED
CHANGE
THAT
CAUSED
THE
PROBLEMS
METHINKS
THAT
YOU
ARE
BEING
SELECTIVE
WITH
THE
FACTS
AGAIN
THE
STORY
YOU
REFER
TO
SAID
THAT
SOME
NASA
PEOPLE
BLAMED
IT
ON
CONGRESS
SUPRISE
SUPRISE
THE
FACT
REMAINS
THAT
IT
IS
THE
CENTERS
YOU
SUPPORT
SO
MUCH
WHO
COVERED
UP
THE
OVERHEADS
AND
WOULDNT
ADDRESS
THE
PROBLEMS
UNTIL
THE
PRESS
PUBLISHED
THE
STORY
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THE
RESTON
MANAGERS
WHERE
WRONG
TO
GET
NASA
TO
ADDRESS
THE
OVERRUNS
YOU
APPROVE
OF
WHAT
THE
CENTERS
DID
TO
COVER
UP
THE
OVERRUNS
IF
IT
TAKES
FOUR
FLIGHTS
A
YEAR
TO
RESUPPLY
THE
STATION
AND
YOU
HAVE
A
COST
OF
MILLION
A
FLIGHT
THEN
YOU
PAY
BILLION
A
YEAR
YOU
STATED
THAT
YOUR
FRIEND
AT
RESTON
SAID
THAT
WITH
THE
CURRENT
STATION
THEY
COULD
RESUPPLY
IT
FOR
A
BILLION
A
YEAR
IF
THE
WRAP
WERE
GONE
THIS
MERELY
POINTS
OUT
A
BLATENT
CONTRIDICTION
IN
YOUR
NUMBERS
THAT
UNDERSTANDABLY
YOU
FAIL
TO
SEE
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
DENNIS
THAT
NASA
DOESNT
INCLUDE
TRANSPORT
COSTS
FOR
RESUPLY
THAT
COMES
FROM
THE
SHUTTLE
BUDGET
WHAT
THEY
WHERE
SAYING
IS
THAT
OPERATIONAL
COSTS
COULD
BE
CUT
IN
HALF
PLUS
TRANSPORT
SORRY
GANG
BUT
I
HAVE
A
DEADLINE
FOR
A
SATELLITE
SO
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
DO
ALLENS
MATH
FOR
HIM
FOR
A
WHILE
I
WILL
HAVE
LITTLE
CHANCE
TO
DO
SO
I
DO
HOPE
YOU
CAN
FIND
THE
TIME
TO
TELL
US
JUST
WHY
IT
WAS
WRONG
OF
RESTON
TO
ASK
THAT
THE
PROBLEMS
WITH
WP
BE
ADDRESSED
ALLEN
LADY
ASTOR
SIR
IF
YOU
WERE
MY
HUSBAND
I
WOULD
POISON
YOUR
COFFEE
W
CHURCHILL
MADAM
IF
YOU
WERE
MY
WIFE
I
WOULD
DRINK
IT
DAYS
TO
FIRST
FLIGHT
OF
DCX
