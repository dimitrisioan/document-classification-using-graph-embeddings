PAT
WRITES
HOW
DIFFERENT
WOULD
THE
CONTAMINATION
THREAT
OF
A
SMALL
MANUEVERING
TUG
BE
FROM
THAT
OF
THE
SHUTTLE
AND
ITS
OMS
ENGINES
THE
APERTURE
DOOR
WILL
BE
SHUT
DURING
REBOOST
USING
THE
SHUTTLE
MEANS
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
SOMEONE
NEARBY
TO
PRY
THE
DOOR
OPEN
AGAIN
IF
IT
SHOULD
STICK
WELL
NO
DURING
THE
ORIGINAL
DEPLOYMENT
MISSION
THE
HST
APERTURE
DOOR
WAS
NOT
OPENED
UNTIL
AFTER
THE
SHUTTLE
HAD
LANDED
I
PRESUME
THAT
DURING
A
REBOOST
MISSION
HST
WOULD
BE
BERTHED
IN
THE
ORBITER
WITH
THE
ORBITER
BAY
DOORS
SHUT
BUT
STILL
THERE
WOULD
BE
LOTS
OF
CONTAMINATION
WORRIES
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
EVA
SUITS
ARE
ONE
OF
THE
HARDEST
THINGS
TO
KEEP
CLEAN
BUT
I
STILL
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
THE
IDEA
IS
COMING
FROM
THAT
HST
NEEDS
A
REBOOST
WE
HAVE
MANY
PROBLEMS
BUT
OUR
ORBIT
IS
THE
LEAST
OF
THEM
THERE
IS
CERTAINLY
NO
PLAN
TO
CHANGE
THE
ORBIT
IN
THE
FIRST
SERVICING
MISSION
IN
