IN
MY
OPINION
SOME
OF
THESE
VENTURES
ARE
FLYING
ON
HOPE
AND
SPECULATION
AND
NOT
ON
SOUND
FINANCIAL
GROUNDS
THIS
REMINDS
ME
MY
FUZZY
BRAIN
RECALLS
THAT
SOMEBODY
WAS
THINKING
OF
REVIVING
THE
SAN
MARCO
LAUNCH
PLATFORM
OFF
THE
COAST
OF
KENYA
WHERE
THE
COPERNICUS
SATELLITE
WAS
LAUNCHED
AROUND
IS
THIS
TRUE
OR
AM
I
IMAGINING
IT
POSSIBLY
ITS
CONNECTED
WITH
ONE
OF
THE
ITALIAN
PROGRAMS
TO
REVIVE
THE
SCOUT
IN
A
NEW
VERSION
THAT
OLD
PLATFORM
MUST
BE
GETTING
PRETTY
RUSTY
AND
THERE
AINT
A
LOT
OF
INFRASTRUCTURE
TO
GO
WITH
IT
MY
INFORMATION
SHOWS
THAT
THE
LAST
SAN
MARCO
LAUNCH
WAS
THERE
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
A
TOTAL
OF
SEVEN
BEFORE
THAT
I
SEEM
TO
RECALL
THAT
SOMEONE
EITHER
ASI
OR
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
ROME
INCLUDES
MONEY
IN
THEIR
ANNUAL
BUDGET
FOR
MAINTAINANCE
OF
THE
PLATFORMS
THERE
ARE
ACTUALLY
TWO
THE
ITALIANS
HAVE
BEEN
SPENDING
MONEY
TO
DEVELOP
AN
ADVANCED
SCOUT
HOWEVER
RECENT
EVENTS
IN
THE
ITALIAN
SPACE
PROGRAM
AND
THE
ITALIAN
GOVERNMENT
OVERALL
MAKE
ME
SKEPTICAL
THAT
THIS
WILL
GET
OFF

GROUND
IN
THE
NEAR
