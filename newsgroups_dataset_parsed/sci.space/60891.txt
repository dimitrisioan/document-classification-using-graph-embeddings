HENRY
SPENCER
WRITES
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
IS
THAT
ALL
ORBITS
ARE
NOT
ALIKE
IT
CAN
ACTUALLY
BE
MORE
EXPENSIVE
TO
REACH
A
SATELLITE
FROM
ANOTHER
ORBIT
THAN
FROM
THE
GROUND
BUT
WITH
CHEAPER
FUEL
FROM
SPACE
BASED
SOURCES
IT
WILL
BE
CHEAPER
TO
REACH
MORE
ORBITS
THAN
FROM
THE
GROUND
ALSO
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
REPAIRSUPPLY
FACILITY
ADDS
VALUE
TO
THE
SPACE
AROUND
IT
IF
YOU
CAN
PUT
YOUR
SATELLITE
IN
AN
ORBIT
WHERE
IT
CAN
BE
REACHED
BY
A
READY
SOURCE
OF
SUPPLY
YOU
CAN
MAKE
IT
CHEAPER
AND
GAIN
BENEFIT
FROM
ECONOMIES
OF
SCALE
