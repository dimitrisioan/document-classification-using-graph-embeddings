IS
PURE
HOKUM
TO

THE

IT
DOESNT

IF
IT

MAYBE
COMMON

OK
SO
THOSE
SCIENTISTS
CAN
GET
AROUND
THE

WITH
FANCY

BUT
HAVE
YOU
LOOKED
AD
THE
HUBBLE
RESULTS
THE
DEFECTS
OF
THE

ARE
PARTIALLY
CORRECTABLE
WITH

SEE
THOSE

FOR

BUT
IS
THE

ARE
COMPLETELY

WHY
IS
THERE
GOING

THE

BE
READY
FOR

THERE
IS
EVERY

YOU
