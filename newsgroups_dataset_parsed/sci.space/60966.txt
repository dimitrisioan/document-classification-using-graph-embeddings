IT
HAS
NO

WE
CANT

FROM
ASTEROIDS

ASIDE
FROM
THE

PROBLEM
WITH

FROM
THE
DIFFICULTY
IN

REACTOR
WORK
IS
THAT
ITS
CONCENTRATION
IN
LUNAR
REGOLITH
IS
JUST
SO
SMALL

SO
ON

THIS

REMINDS
ME
OF

CLAIMS
SOME

ABOUT
THE

ONLY
A

IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
HOW
THE
DISADVANTAGES
OF
THE
MOON
COULD
BE
OVERCOME
BY
SUCH
A
SMALL
INCREASE
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
THE

NEVER
MIND
THE

LESS

ITS

ONCE
CHLORINE
CHEMISTRY
HAS
BEEN
BANNED
ON

AS
IS
BEING
ADVOCATED
BY
SOME

WE
ARE
OF

NOT
ALLOWED
