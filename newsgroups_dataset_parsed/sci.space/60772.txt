here
are
some
recent
observations
taken
by
the
hubble
space
telescope
o
the
faint
object
spectrograph
fos
was
used
to
make
ultraviolet
observations
of
both
the
planet
pluto
and
its
moon
charon
the
peakups
were
successful
the
observations
were
executed
as
scheduled
and
no
problems
were
reported
o
observations
were
made
using
the
high
speed
photometer
of
the
planet
uranus
during
an
occultation
by
a
faint
star
in
capricornus
these
observations
will
help
in
our
understanding
of
the
planets
atmospheric
radiative
and
dynamical
processes
this
event
occurred
close
to
the
last
quarter
moon
and
special
arrangements
had
to
be
made
to
modify
the
lunar
limit
tests
to
allow
these
observations
the
observations
are
currently
being
reviewed
and
all
the
observations
looked
okay
