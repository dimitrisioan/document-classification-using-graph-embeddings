SCHEDULED
FOR
DAYS
IN

PRBACCESSDIGEXCOM
PAT
WRITES
HOW
WILL
SAID
REBOOST
BE
DONE
GRAPPLE
HST
STOW
IT
IN
CARGO
BAY
DO
OMS
BURN

UNSTOW
HST
REPAIR
GYROS
COSTAR
INSTALL
FIX
SOLAR
ARRAYS
THEN
RETURN
TO
EARTH
ACTUALLY
THE
REBOOST
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
DONE
LAST
SO
THAT
THERE
IS
A
FUEL
RESERVE
DURING
THE
EVAS
IN
CASE
THEY
HAVE
TO
CHASE
DOWN
AN
ADRIFT
ASTRONAUT
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
BUT
YES
YOUVE
GOT
THE
IDEA
THE
REBOOST
IS
DONE
BY
TAKING
THE
WHOLE
SHUTTLE
UP
MY
GUESS
IS
WHY
BOTHER
WITH
USINGTHE
SHUTTLE
TO
REBOOST
WHY
NOT
GRAPPLE
DO
ALL
SAID
FIXES
BOLT
A
SMALL
LIQUID
FUELED
THRUSTER
MODULE
TO
HST
THEN
LET
IT
MAKE
THE
REBOOST
SOMEBODY
HAS
TO
BUILD
THAT
THRUSTER
MODULE
ITS
NOT
AN
OFFTHESHELF
ITEM
NOR
IS
IT
A
TRIVIAL
PIECE
OF
HARDWARE
SINCE
IT
HAS
TO
INCLUDE
ATTITUDE
CONTROL
HSTS
OWN
IS
NOT
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
COMPENSATE
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
THRUSTER
IMBALANCE
GUIDANCE
THERE
IS
NO
PROVISION
TO
FEED
GYRO
DATA
FROM
HSTS
OWN
GYROS
TO
AN
EXTERNAL
DEVICE
AND
SEPARATION
YOU
DONT
WANT
IT
LEFT
ATTACHED
AFTERWARD
IF
ONLY
TO
AVOID
POSSIBLE
CONTAMINATION
AFTER
THE
TELESCOPE
LID
IS
OPENED
AGAIN
YOU
ALSO
GET
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
LID
IS
GOING
TO
OPEN
AFTER
THE
REBOOST
IS
DONE
AND
HST
IS
INACCESSIBLE
TO
THE
SHUTTLE
THE
LID
STAYS
CLOSED
FOR
THE
DURATION
OF
ALL
OF
THIS
TO
PREVENT
MIRROR
CONTAMINATION
FROM
THRUSTERS
AND
THE
LIKE
THE
ORIGINAL
PLAN
WAS
TO
USE
THE
ORBITAL
MANEUVERING
VEHICLE
TO
DO
THE
REBOOST
THE
OMV
WAS
PLANNED
TO
BE
A
SORT
OF
SMALL
SPACE
TUG
WELL
SUITED
TO
PRECISELY
THIS
SORT
OF
JOB
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
WAS
COSTING
A
LOT
TO
DEVELOP
AND
THE
LIST
OF
DEFINITELYKNOWN
APPLICATIONS
WAS
RELATIVELY
SHORT
SO
IT
GOT
CANCELLED
RESEMBLES
A
HIGHSPEED
COLLISION
