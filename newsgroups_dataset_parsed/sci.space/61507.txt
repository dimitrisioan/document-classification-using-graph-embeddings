over
the
years
we
have
decided
that
certain
cultures
need
improvements
the
native
americans
is
a
good
example
prior
to
our
attempt
to
civilize
them
the
native
american
culture
had
very
little
crime
no
homelessnes
no
poverty
this
is
shall
we
say
an
overlybroad
statement
in
particular
are
you
referring
to
the
native
american
culture
that
existed
in
or
the
one
that
existed
in
simplify
things
by
assuming
were
talking
about
the
eastern
us
rather
than
the
whole
continent
given
that
those
were
radically
different
cultures
which
one
are
you
referring
to
if
we
encounter
life
elsewhere
do
we
tell
them
they
have
to
live
in
houses
farm
the
land
and
go
to
church
on
sunday
note
that
the
precolumbian
native
americans
east
of
the
mississippi
did
all
of
these
things
well
maybe
not
on
sunday
but
they
did
have
organized
religions
not
to
mention
cities
and
governments
if
you
are
judging
the
native
americans
by
the
tribal
culture
that
existed
in
you
might
want
to
read
an
account
of
the
de
soto
expedition
to
find
out
what
precolumbian
native
american
culture
at
least
in
the
more
civilized
parts
of
the
continent
was
like
