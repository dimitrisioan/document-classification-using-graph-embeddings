RE
JAPANESE
MOON
LANDING
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
A
STABLE
LUNAR
ORBIT
IS
IT
RIGHT
THAT
IS
NEW
STUFF
FOR
ME
SO
IT
MEANS
THAT
YOU
JUST
CAN
NOT
PUT
A
SATTELLITE
AROUND
AROUND
THE
MOON
FOR
TOO
LONG
BECAUSE
ITS
ORBIT
WILL
BE
UNSTABLE
IF
SO
WHAT
IS
THE
REASON
IS
THAT
BECAUSE
THE
COMBINED
GRAVITACIONAL
ATRACTION
OF
THE
SUNMOON
AND
EARTH
THAT
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
A
STABLE
ORBIT
AROUND
THE
MOON
