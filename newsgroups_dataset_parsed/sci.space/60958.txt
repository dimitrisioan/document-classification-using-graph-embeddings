SCIENCE
DEPT
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
SPECIFICALLY
ON
A
SMALLSCALE
SOLAR
SAIL
PROPOSED
AS
A
STUDENT
SPACE
PROJECT
THE
GUY
GIVING
THE
TALK
WAS
KEEN
TO
GENERATE
INTEREST
IN
THE
PROJECT
ILL
TYPEIN
THE
HANDOUT
HE
GAVE
OUT
AT
THE

HERE
GOES
STUFF
DELETED
HOWEVER
IT
IS
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
DESIGN
A

IM
GLAD

SOMEONE
