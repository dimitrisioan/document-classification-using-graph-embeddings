i
am
looking
for
any
information
concerning
projects
involving
solar
sails
i
was
at
an
interesting
seminar
at
work
uks
ral
space
science
dept
on
this
subject
specifically
on
a
smallscale
solar
sail
proposed
as
a
student
space
project
the
guy
giving
the
talk
was
keen
to
generate
interest
in
the
project
ill
typein
the
handout
he
gave
out
at
the
meeting
here
goes
stuff
deleted
however
it
is
more
difficult
to
design
a
practical
solar
sail
than
most
people
realize
the
pressure
of
sunlight
is
only
about
one
kilogram
per
square
kilometer
im
glad
to
see
that
someone
is
working
on
this
however
it
would
be
nice
if
he
got
his
units
right
josh
hopkins
find
a
way
or
make
one
