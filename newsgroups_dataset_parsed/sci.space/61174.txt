put

attached
it
to
a

and
a
regular
set
of
solid

motors
and
launch

interupting

sounds
like
first
point
above
somehow
i
have
a
strange
attraction
for
this
idea
living
in
a
modular
home
maybe
has
altered
my
mind
the
only
thing
that
scares
me
is
the
part
about
simply
strapping
ssmes
and
a
nosecone
on
it
and
just
launching
it
i
have
this
vision
of
something
going
terribly
wrong
with
the
launch
resulting
in
the
complete
loss
of
the
new
modular
space
station
not
just
a
peice
of
it
as
would
be
the
case
with
staged
inorbit
construction
