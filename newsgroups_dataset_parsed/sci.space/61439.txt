PONTIFICATED
SORRY
TO
SPLIT
HAIRS
BUT
I
JUST
READ
IN
THE
MAKING
OF
THE
ATOMIC
BOMB
THAT
TEFLON
WAS
DEVELOPED
DURING
WORLD
WAR
A
SEALANT
WAS
NEEDED
FOR
THE
TUBING
IN
WHICH
URANIUM
HEXAFLUORIDE
PASSED
AS
IT
WAS
GRADUALLY
ENRICHED
BY
DIFUSSION
IS
VERY
CORROSIVE
AND
SOME
VERY
INERT
YET
FLEXIBLE
MATERIAL
WAS
NEEDED
FOR
THE
SEALS
TO
SPLIT
A
SPLIT
HAIR
I
BELIEVE
THAT
TEFLON
MONOMER
WAS
DISCOVERED
BY
ACCIDENT
WHEN
SOMEONE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
FOUND
WHAT
HE
THOUGHT
WAS
A
LIQUID

HAD
TURNED

A
SOLID
IT
JUST
HAPPEND
TO
FIT
THE

FOR
THE
ABOVE
USE
IM
CROSSPOSTING

THAT
WHAT
I
