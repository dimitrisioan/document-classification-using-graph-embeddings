WRITES
A
SHORT
STORY
IN
THE
NEWSPAPER
A
FEW
DAYS
AGO
MADE
SOME
SORT
OF
MENTION
ABOUT
HOW
THE
JAPANESE
USING
WHAT
SOUNDED
LIKE
A
GRAVITY
ASSIST
HAD
JUST
MANAGED
TO
CRASH
OR
CRASHLAND
A
PACKAGE
ON
THE
MOON
THEIR
HITEN
ENGINEERINGTEST
MISSION
SPENT
A
WHILE
IN
A
HIGHLY
ECCENTRIC
EARTH
ORBIT
DOING
LUNAR
FLYBYS
AND
THEN
WAS
INSERTED
INTO
LUNAR
ORBIT
USING
SOME
VERY
TRICKY
GRAVITYASSISTLIKE
MANEUVERING
THIS
MEANT
THAT
IT
WOULD
CRASH
ON
THE
MOON
EVENTUALLY
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
A
STABLE
LUNAR
ORBIT
AS
FAR
AS
ANYONE
KNOWS
AND
I
BELIEVE
I
RECALL
HEARING
RECENTLY
THAT
IT
WAS
ABOUT
TO
HAPPEN
THE
GRAVITY
MANEUVERING
THAT
WAS
USED
WAS
TO
EXPLOIT
FUZZY
REGIONS
THESE
ARE
DESCRIBED
BY
THE
INVENTOR
AS
EXPLOITING
THE
SECONDORDER
PERTURBATIONS
IN
A
THREE
BODY
SYSTEM
THE
PROBE
WAS
LAUNCHED
INTO
THIS
REGION
FOR
THE
EARTHMOONSUN
SYSTEM
WHERE
THE
PERTURBATIONS
AFFECTED
IT
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
AS
TO
ALLOW
IT
TO
GO
INTO
LUNAR
ORBIT
WITHOUT
LARGE
EXPENDITURES
OF
FUEL
TO
SLOW
DOWN
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
NATURAL
OBJECTS
SOMETIMES
GET
CAPTURED
WITHOUT
EXPENDING
FUEL
WELL
JUST
FIND
THE
TRAJECTORY
THAT
MAKES
IT
POSSIBLE
THE
ORIGINATOR
OF
THE
TECHNIQUE
SAID
THAT
NASA
WASNT
INTERESTED
BUT
THAT
JAPAN
WAS
BECAUSE
THEIR
PROBE
WAS
SMALL
AND
COULDNT
HOLD
A
LOT
OF
FUEL
FOR
DECELERATION
THIS
FROM
AN
ISSUE
OF
SCIENCE
NEWS
OR
THE
PLANETARY
REPORT
I
BELIEVE
ABOUT
MONTHS
AGO
