GALILEO
GALILEOS
HGA
IS
STUCK
THE
HGA
WAS
LEFT
CLOSED
BECAUSE
GALILEO
HAD
A
VENUS
FLYBY
IF
THE
HGA
WERE
POINTED
ATT
HE
SUN
NEAR
VENUS
IT
WOULD
COOK
THE
FOCI
ELEMENTS
QUESTION
WHY
COULDNT
GALILEOS
COURSE
MANUEVERS
HAVE
BEEN
DESIGNED
SUCH
THAT
THE
HGA
DID
NOT
EVER
DO
A
SUN
POINT
AFTER
ALL
IT
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
AIMED
AT
EARTH
ANYWAY
OR
WOULD
IT
BE
THAT
AN
EMERGENCY
SITUATION
IE
SPACECRAFT
SAFING
AND
SEEK
MIGHT
HAVE
CAUSED
AN
HGA
SUN
POINT
