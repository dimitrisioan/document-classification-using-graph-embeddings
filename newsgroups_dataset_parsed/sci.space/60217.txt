THE
TASTE
IS
HARD
TO
DESCRIBE
ALTHOUGH
I
REMEMBER
IT
FONDLY
IT
WAS
MOST
CERTAINLY
MORE
CANDY
THAN
SAY
A
MODERN
POWER
BAR
SORT
OF
A
TOFFEE
INJECTED
WITH
VITAMINS
THE
CHOCOLATE
POWER
BAR
IS
A
ROUGH
APPROXIMATION
OF
THE
TASTE
STRAWBERRY
SUCKED
PEANUT
BUTTER
WAS
DEFINITELY
MY
FAVORITE
I
DONT
THINK
I
EVER
TOOK
A
SECOND
BITE
OF
THE
STRAWBERRY
I
RECENTLY
JOINED
NUTRISYSTEM
AND
THEIR
CHEWY
FUDGE
BAR
IS
VERY
REMINICENT
OF
THE
CHOCOLATE
SPACE
FOOD

HAPPY
AND
YOUR
INTESTINES
ARE
IN
KNOTS
JOY

OPINIONS

NOT
THOSE
OF
STRATUS
HELL
I
DONT
EVEN
AGREE
WITH
MYSELF
LOGIC

A
WREATH
OF
PRETTY
FLOWERS
THAT
SMELL
BAD
