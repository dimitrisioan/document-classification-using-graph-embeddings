the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
although
i
remember
it
fondly
it
was
most
certainly
more
candy
than
say
a
modern
power
bar
sort
of
a
toffee
injected
with
vitamins
the
chocolate
power
bar
is
a
rough
approximation
of
the
taste
strawberry
sucked
peanut
butter
was
definitely
my
favorite
i
dont
think
i
ever
took
a
second
bite
of
the
strawberry
i
recently
joined
nutrisystem
and
their
chewy
fudge
bar
is
very
reminicent
of
the
chocolate
space
food
this
is
the
only
thing
i
can
find
that
even
comes
close
the
taste
it
takes
you
back
your
tastebuds
are
happy
and
your
intestines
are
in
knots
joy
mark

my
opinions
are
not
those
of
stratus
hell
i
dont
even
agree
with
myself
logic
is
a
wreath
of
pretty
flowers
that
smell
bad
