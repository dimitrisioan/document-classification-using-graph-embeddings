if
anyone
knows
anyone
else
who
would
like
to
get
scispace
but
doesnt
have
an
internet
feed
or
has
a
cryptic
internet
feed
i
would
be
willing
to
feed
it
to
them
kudos
to
mark
for
his
generous
offer
but
there
already
exists
a
large
emailbased
forwarding
system
for
scispace
posts
space
digest
it
mirrors
scispace
exactly
and
provides
simple
twoway
communication
i
think
mark
was
talking
about
making
it
available
to
people
who
didnt
have
email
in
the
first
place
if
anybody
in
the
boston
area
wants
a
scispace
feed
