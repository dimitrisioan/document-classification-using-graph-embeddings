is
anybody
out
there
willing
to
discuss
with
me
careers
in
the
army
that
deal
with
space
after
i
graduate
i
will
have
a
commitment
to
serve
in
the
army
and
i
would
like
to
spend
it
in
a
spacerelated
field
i
saw
a
post
a
long
time
ago
about
the
air
force
space
command
which
made
a
fleeting
reference
to
its
army
counterpart
any
more
info
on
that
would
be
appreciated
im
looking
for
things
like
do
i
branch
intelligence
or
signal
or
other
to
whom
do
i
voice
my
interest
in
space
what
qualifications
are
necessary
etc
etc
btw
my
major
is
computer
science
engineering
kerry
im
guessing
a
little
at
this
because
its
been
a
few
years
since
i
saw
the
info
but
you
will
probably
want
to
look
at
air
defense
artillery
as
a
specialty
or
possibly
signals
the
kind
of
thing
youre
looking
for
is
sditype
assignments
but
itll
be
pretty
prosaic
stuff
things
like
hardkill
atbm
missiles
some
of
the
cobra
rigs
that
kind
of
thing
hope
that
gives
you
some
ideas
on
where
to
look
though
