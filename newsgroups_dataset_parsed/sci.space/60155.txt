WRITES
THE
REAL
REASON
WHY
ACCELERATOR
BREEDERS
OR
INCINERATORS
ARE
NOT
BEING
BUILT
IS
THAT
THERE
ISNT
ANY
REASON
TO
DO
SO
NATURAL
URANIUM
IS
STILL
TOO
CHEAP
AND
GEOLOGICAL
DISPOSAL
OF
ACTINIDES
LOOKS
TECHNICALLY
REASONABLE

THE
GROUND
URANIUM
RESERVES
ARE
ESTIMATED
AT
ABOUT
MILLION
TONS
AND
IT
IS
ANTICIPATED
THAT
THE
DEMAND
AND

WILL
COLLAPSE

THE

UNDER

URANIUM
DISSOLVED
IN
SEAWATER
THE
TOTAL
QUANITY
OF
URANIUM
DISSOLVED
IN
SEAWATER
IS
ESTIMATED
TO
BE
ABOUT
BILLION
TONS
A
HUGE
AMOUNT
WHEN
COMPARED
WITH
GROUND
URANIUM
RESERVES
I
HATE
TO
POUR
COLD
WATER
ON
THIS
BUT
CURRENTLY
SEAWATER
EXTRACTED
URANIUM
EVEN
USING
THE
NEW
IMPROVED
FIBER
ABSORBERS
FROM
JAPAN
IS
ABOUT
TIMES
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
URANIUM
ON
THE
SPOT
MARKET
URANIUM
IS
VERY
CHEAP
RIGHT
NOW
AROUND
RIGHT
NOW
THERE
ARE
MINES
CLOSING
BECAUSE
THEY
CANT
COMPETE
WITH
PLACES
LIKE
CIGAR
LAKE
IN
CANADA
WHERE
THE
ORE
IS
SO
RICH
THEY
PRESENT
SAFETY
HAZARDS
TO
THE
MINES
WHO
WORK
IN
SHIELDED
VEHICLES
PLENTY
OF
OTHER
SOURCES
FOR
EXAMPLE
URANIUM
FROM
PHOSPHATE
PROCESSING
WOULD
COME
ON

BEFORE
URANIUM
REACHED
DEMAND
AND

BALANCE
WILL
COLLAPSE
IS
NONSENSE
SUPPLY
AND

ALWAYS
BALANCE
WHAT
CHANGES
IS
THE
PRICE
IS
URANIUM
GOING
TO
INCREASE
IN
PRICE
BY
A
FACTOR
OF
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
CENTURY
NOT
BLOODY
LIKELY
NEW
NUCLEAR
REACTORS
ARE
NOT
BEING
BUILT
AT
A
SUFFICIENT
RATE
URANIUM
FROM
SEAWATER
IS
INTERESTING
BUT
ITS
A
LONG
TERM
PROJECT
OR
A
PROJECT
THAT
THE
JAPANESE
MIGHT
JUSTIFY
ON
GROUNDS
OF
SELFSUFFICIENCY
