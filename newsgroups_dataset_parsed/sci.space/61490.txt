SOMEHOW
I
HAVE
A
STRANGE
ATTRACTION
FOR
THIS
IDEA
LIVING
IN
A
MODULAR
HOME
MAYBE
HAS
ALTERED
MY
MIND
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
SCARES
ME
IS
THE
PART
ABOUT
SIMPLY
STRAPPING
SSMES
AND
A
NOSECONE
ON
IT
AND
JUST
LAUNCHING
IT
I
HAVE
THIS
VISION
OF
SOMETHING
GOING
TERRIBLY
WRONG
WITH
THE
LAUNCH
RESULTING
IN
THE
COMPLETE
LOSS
OF
THE
NEW
MODULAR
SPACE
STATION
NOT
JUST
A
PEICE
OF
IT
AS
WOULD
BE
THE
CASE
WITH
STAGED

I
CERTAINLY
LIKE
THIS
OPTION
C
ITS
MUCH
MORE
LIKE
THE
ORIGINAL

B
STUDIES
FROM
THE
EARLY
GOOD
STUFF
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
MORE
LIKE
THE
STUFF
FROM

A
AND
MOLPHASE
B
ENDED
WITH
A
POWER
TOWER
APPROACH
ITS
ALSO
VERY
EXPENSIVE
IN
TERMS
OF
UPFRONT
DEVELOPMENT
COSTSSO
ALL
YOU
GET
IS
A
REDISTRIBUTION
OF
COSTS
FROM
THE
SHUTTLE
FLIGHTS
TO
THE
CONTRACTORS
WHO
BUILD
IT
