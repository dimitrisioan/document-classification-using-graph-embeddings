I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
ANY
INFORMATION
CONCERNING
PROJECTS
INVOLVING
SOLAR
SAILS
I
WAS
AT
AN
INTERESTING
SEMINAR
AT
WORK
UKS
RAL
SPACE
SCIENCE
DEPT
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
SPECIFICALLY
ON
A
SMALLSCALE
SOLAR
SAIL
PROPOSED
AS
A
STUDENT
SPACE
PROJECT
THE
GUY
GIVING
THE
TALK
WAS
KEEN
TO
GENERATE
INTEREST
IN
THE
PROJECT
ILL
TYPEIN
THE
HANDOUT
HE
GAVE
OUT
AT
THE
MEETING
HERE
GOES
THE
MICROLIGHT
SOLAR
SAIL
INTRODUCTION
THE
SOLAR
SAIL
IS
A
WELLESTABLISHED
CONCEPT
HARNESSING
THE
PRESSURE
OF
SUNLIGHT
A
SPACECRAFT
WOULD
HAVE
UNLIMITED
RANGE
IN
PRINCIPLE
SUCH
A
VEHICLE
COULD
EXPLORE
THE
WHOLE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
WITH
ZERO
FUEL
CONSUMPTION
HOWEVER
IT
IS
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
DESIGN
A
PRACTICAL
SOLAR
SAIL
THAN
MOST
PEOPLE
REALIZE
THE
PRESSURE
OF
SUNLIGHT
IS
ONLY
ABOUT
ONE
KILOGRAM
PER
SQUARE
KILOMETER
DEPLOYING
AND
CONTROLLING
THE
LARGE
AREA
OF
ALUMINIZED
FABRIC
WHICH
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
TO
TRANSPORT
A
CONVENTIONAL
TYPE
SPACECRAFT
IS
A
DAUNTING
TASK
THIS
IS
WHY
DESPITE
THE
POTENTIAL
OF
HTE
IDEA
NO
SUCH
CRAFT
HAS
ACTUALLY
BEEN
LAUNCHED
TO
DATE
RECENT
ADVANCES
IN
MICROELECTRONICS
MAKE
POSSIBLE
A
DIFFERENT
CONCEPT
A
TINY
SAIL
JUST
A
FEW
METRES
IN
DIAMETER
WHICH
COULD
BE
CONTROLLED
PURELY
BE
ELECTRONICS
WITH
NO
MECHANICAL
PARTS
SEVERAL
ATTITUDE
CONTROL
METHODS
ARE
FEASIBLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
PRESSURE
SUNLIGHT
EXERTS
ON
A
PANEL
OF
SOLAR
CELLS
VARIES
ACCORDING
TO
WHETHER
POWER
IS
BEING
DRAWN
THE
KEY
COMPONENTS
OF
THE
CRAFT
WILL
BE
A
MINUTE
CCD
CAMERA
DEVELOPED
AT
EDINBURGH
UNIVERSITY
WHICH
CAN
ACT
AS
BOTH
ATTITUDE
SENSOR
AND
DATA
GATHERING
DEVICE
SOLAR
CELLS
PROVIDING
WATT
POWER
FOR
CONTROL
AND
COMMUNICATION
AND
A
DIRECTIONAL
RADIO
ANTENNA
ETCHED
ONTO
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
SAIL
ITSELF
LAUNCHED
AS
A
PIGGYBACK
PAYLOAD
THE
TOTAL
COST
OF
THE
MISSION
CAN
BE
LIMITED
TO
A
FEW
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
DOLLARS
THE
CRAFT
WOULD
BE
CAPABLE
OF
SOME
AMBITIOUS
MISSIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
IT
COULD
RENDEZVOUS
WITH
A
NEARBY
ASTEROID
FROM
THE
APOLLO
OR
AMOR
GROUPS
CLOSEUP
PICTURES
COULD
BE
TRANSMITTED
BACK
TO
EARTH
AT
A
LOW
BIT
RATE
B
IT
COULD
BE
STEERED
INTO
A
LUNAR
POLAR
ORBIT
PREVIOUSLY
UNOBSERVED
AREAS
AROUND
THE
LUNAR
POLES
COULD
BE
VIEWED
BY
ANGLING
THE
SAIL
TO
REFLECT
SUNLIGHT
DOWNWARDS
POLAR
CRATERS
WHOSE
BASES
NEVER
RECEIVE
SUNLIGHT
COULD
BE
IMAGED
BRIGHT
REFLECTIONS
WOULD
CONFIRM
THAT
VOLATILES
SUCH
AS
WATER
ICE
HAVE
BECOME
TRAPPED
IN
THESE
LOCATIONSIMMENSELY
VALUABLE
INFORMATION
FOR
SETTING
UP
A
MANNED
LUNAR
BASE
BTW
C
IT
COULD
BE
SENT
TO
RENDEZVOUS
WITH
A
SMALL
ASTEROID
OR
COMET
NUCLEUS
IMPACTING
AT
LOW
SPEED
A
THIN
WIRE
PROBE
ATTACHED
TO
THE
CRAFT
CAUSES
IT
TO
REBOUND
WHILE
CAPTURING
A
TINY
SAMPLE
IS
A
SHARPEDGED
TUBE
LIKE
PERFORMING
A
BIOPSY
RETURNING
TO
EARTH
THE
SAIL
ACTS
AS
AN
IDEAL
REENTRY
PARACHUTE
LOAD
PER

ENSURES
THAT

IS
RERADIATED
SO
EFECTIVELY
THAT
THE
