MARKETING
WOULD
BE
WONDERFULL
IN

HERRIN
WRITES
DELETED
IS
IT
NOT
ALSO
AN
ABOMINATION
THAT
SOMEBODY
WOULD
SPEND
MONEY
ON
SPACE
ADVERTISING
WHEN
THOSE
CHILDREN
ARE
STARVING
PERHAPS
SOME
REDISTRIBUTION
OF
WEALTH
WOULD
HELP
THEM
DAN
NOT
TO
FLAME
REALLY
BUT
THATS
AN
ABOMINABLE
VIEWPOINT
WHILE
WERE
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
ABOMINATIONS
IF
WE
FOLLOWED
THE
REDISTIRIBUTION
OF
WEALTH
AND
BY
THE
WAY
IST
THAT
WHAT
CLINTO
AND
THE
DEMOCRATS
ARE
TRYING
TO
DO
EVERYONE
WOULD
STARVE
IN
SHORT
ORDER
NOT
ONLY
IS
IT
IMPOSSOBLE

CAN
YOU
SAY
BLACK

ANYONE
BUT
THE

PERHAPS
WE
SHOULD
BOYCOTT
THOSE

IF

GET
FINISHED
AND
THERE
IS
A

FOR
IT
THOSE
ABOMINABLE

PROBABLY
BE
MUCH
