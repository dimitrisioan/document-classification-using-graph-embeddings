are
you
sure
is
the
right
number
as
far
as
i
know
pilots
are
blackout
in
dives
that
exceed
seems
to
be
out
of
human
tolerance
would
anybody
clarify
this
please
lan
apart
from
the
fact
that
you
get
g
in
the
pullout
not
the
dive
that
figure
is
about
right
for
sustained
g
no
protection
the
duration
of

its
rate
of
onset
body
position
and
support
aids
are
all
critical
parts
of
the
equation
i
remember
one
note
about
instrumented
gridiron
players
recording
peaks
about
stapp
the
aviation
doctor
either
by
accident
or

took
a

against
a
standard
harness
it
had

calculate
the
stopping
time
even
from
at
that
g
a
bangseat
can
get
up
to
about
g
and
youd
better
be
sitting
straight
find
the
book
by
martinbakers
human
guinea
pig
to
hear
how
bad
it
can
get
if
the
rate
of
onset
is
too
high
a
reclining
position
and
a
good
gsuit
can
keep
a
pilot
functioning
at
around
a
flotation
tank
should
be
a
good
bet
since
you
can
treat
the
body
as
a
fluid
and
highpressure
situations
are
not
new
anyone
have
any
figures
