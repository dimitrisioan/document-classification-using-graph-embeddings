BRUCE

WRITES
IF
REBOOSTING
THE
HST
BY
CARRYING
IT
WITH
A
SHUTTLE
WOULD
NOT
DAMAGE
IT
THEN
WHY
COULDNT
HST
BE
BROUGHT
BACK
TO
EARTH
AND
THE
REPAIR
JOB
DONE
HERE
IS
IT
BECAUSE
TWO
SHUTTLE
FLIGHTS
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
ADDING
TO
THE
ALREDY
HORRENDOUS
EXPENSE
I
DONT
THINK
A
REBOOST
EXERCISE
IS
ANALOGOUS
TO
A
SHUTTLE

IN

I
WOULD
THINK
OF
THE
REBOOST
AS
A
GENTILE
PUSH
WHERE
A
LANDING
THEN
LAUNCH
AS
TWO
JOLTS
WHICH
WOULD
PUT
MORE
MECHANICAL
STRESS
ON
THE
INSTRUMENTS
ADDITIONALLY
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
CONCERN
ABOUT
LANDING
LOADS
TO
THE
SHUTTLE
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
A
LADEN
LANDING
FINALLY
PROBABLY
SOME
THOUGHT
WENT
INTO
POSSIBLE
CONTAMINATION
PROBLEMS
IF
THE
INSTRUMENTS
CAME
BACK
TO
EARTH
OF
COURSE
THE
COST
OF
TWO
SHUTTLE
LAUNCHES
IS
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
AVOID
SOMETHING
THAT
MIGHT
BE
DONE
IN
ONE
SHUTTLE
LAUNCH
