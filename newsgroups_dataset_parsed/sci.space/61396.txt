WRITES
BUT
TRY
TO
LAND
A
SHUTTLE
WITH
THAT
BIG
HUGE
TELESCOPE
IN
THE
BACK
AND
YOU
COULD
HAVE
PROBLEMS
THE
SHUTTLE
JUST
ISNT
DESIGNED
TO
LAND
WITH
THAT
MUCH
WEIGHT
IN
THE
PAYLOAD
IS
HST
REALLY
THAT
MUCH
HEAVIER
THAN
A
SPACELAB
I
CANT
SPEAK
TO
SHEER
MASS
BUT
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
HST
WASNT
BUILT
TO
EVER
BE
BROUGHT
BACK
DOWN
ITS
NOT
BUILT
FOR
THOSE
KINDS
OF
JOLT
FORCES
AND
THERE
IS
NO
SUPPORT
CRADLE
FOR
IT
WHICH
IS
ADDITIONAL
WEIGHT
THAT
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
JUST
TO
THROW
IT
OUT
THERE
THE
MASS
OF
THE
TELESCOPE
IS
KG
LB
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
SPACE
LAB
WEIGHS
BUT
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
LESS
CAN
ANYONE
VERIFY
ALSO
REMEMBER
THAT
WEIGHT
WAS
NOT
THE
ONLY
CONCERN
AS
MANY
OTHERS
HAVE
NOTED
JUST
ONE
POSSIBLE
CONCERN
I
WAS
RESPONDING
TO
A
STATEMENT
THAT
IF
YOU
CAN
BOOST
IT
WHY
CANT
YOU
LAND
IT
THOSE
ARE
TOO
DIFFERENT
PROBLEMS
