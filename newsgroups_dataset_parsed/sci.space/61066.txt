sure
why
not
a
nasa
friend
and
i
spent
one
drunken
night
figuring
out
just
exactly
how
much
gold
mylar
wed
need
to
put
the
golden
arches
of
a
certain
american
fast
food
organization
on
the
face
of
the
moon
fortunately
we
sobered
up
in
the
morning
hmmm
it
actually
isnt
all
that
much
is
it
like
about
million
if
you
think
that
sounds
like
a
lot
its
only
a
few
tens
of
per
burger
that
said
organization
sold
last
year
youd
be
best
off
with
a
reflective
substance
that
could
be
sprayed
thinly
by
an
unmanned
craft
in
lunar
orbit
or
rather
a
large
set
of
such
craft
if
you
can
get
a
reasonable
albedo
it
would
be
visible
even
at
new
moon
since
the
moon
itself
is
quite
dark
and
bright
at
full
moon
you
might
have
to
abandon
the
colour
though
buy
a
cheap
launch
system
design
reusable
moon
lunar
orbit
unmanned
spraying
craft
build
said
craft
establish
a
lunar
base
to
extract
say
for
colour
youd
be
better
off
with
a
sulphur
compound
i
suppose
and
some
sort
of
propellant
and
bobs
your
uncle
ill
do
it
for
say
billion
dollars
plus
changes
of
identity
for
me
and
all
my
loved
ones
delivery
date
can
we
get
the
fastfood
chain
bidding
against
the
fizzydrink
vendors
who
else
might
be
interested
would
they
buy
it
given
that
its
a
lot
more
expensive
and
not
much
more
impressive
than
putting
a
large
set
of
severalkm
inflatable
billboards
in
leo
or
in
geo
visible
hours
from
your
key
growth
market
ill
do
that
for
only
and
the
changes
of
identity
