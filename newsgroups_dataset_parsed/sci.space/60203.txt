i
had
spacefood
sticks
just
about
every
morning
for
breakfast
in
first
and
second
grade
they
came
in
chocolate
strawberry
and
peanut
butter
and
were
cylinders
about
long
and
in
diameter
wrapped
in
yellow
space
foil
well
it
seemed
like
space
foil
at
the
time
wasnt
there
a
plain
flavor
too
they
looked
more
like
some
kind
of
extruded
industrial
product
than
food
perfectly
smooth
cylinders
with
perfectly
smooth
ends
kinda
scary
the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
although
i
remember
it
fondly
it
was
most
certainly
more
candy
than
say
a
modern
power
bar
sort
of
a
toffee
injected
with
vitamins
the
chocolate
power
bar
is
a
rough
approximation
of
the
taste
strawberry
sucked
an
other
post
described
it
as
like
a
microwaved
tootsie
roll
which
captures
the
texture
pretty
well
as
for
taste
they
were
like
candy
only
not
very
sweet
does
that
make
sense
i
recall
liking
them
for
their
texture
not
taste
i
guess
i
have
well
developed
texture
buds
man
these
were
my
it
was
obligatory
to
eat
a
few
while
watching
captain
scarlet
does
anybody
else
remember
that
as
long
as
were
off
the
topic
of
space
