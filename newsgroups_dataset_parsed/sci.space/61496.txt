NO
THE
THING
IS
DESIGNED
TO
BE
RETRIEVABLE
IN
A
PINCH
INDEED
THIS
DICTATED
A
RATHER
ODD
DESIGN
FOR
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
SINCE
THEY
HAD
TO
BE
RETRACTABLE
AS
WELL
AS
EXTENDABLE
AND
MAY
THUS
HAVE
INDIRECTLY
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
ARRAYFLAPPING
PROBLEMS
WHY
NOT
DESIGN
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
TO
BE
DETACHABLE
IF
THE
SHUTTLE
IS
GOING
TO
RETUNR
THE
HST
WHAT
BOTHER
ARE
SOME
ARRAYS
JUST
FIT
THEM
WITH
A
QUICK
RELEASE
ONE

YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
PUT

IN
THE

FOR
A

YOU
DONT
WANT
TO

OBSERVATORY
ONE
OF
THE

REQUIREMENTS
WAS
THAT
THERE
BE
NO
STOREDENERGY
MECAHNISMS
SPRINGS
EXPLOSIVE
SQUIBS
GAS
SHOCKS
ETC
USED
FOR
DEPLOYMENT
THIS
WAS
PARTIALLY
SO
THAT
EVERYTHING
COULD
BE
REELED
BACK
IN
TO
PUT
IT
BACK
IN
THE
PAYLOAD
BAY
AND
PARTIALLY
FOR
SAFETY
CONSIDERATIONS
IVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
WINGS
ON
A
CRUISE
MISSILE
WOULD
CUT
YOU
IN
HALF
IF
YOU
WERE
STANDING
IN
THEIR
SWATH
WHEN
THEY
OPENED
BACK
WHEN
THE
SHUTTLE
WOULD
BE
GOING
