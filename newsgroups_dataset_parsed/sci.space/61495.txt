is
there
a
plan
to
put
a
satellite
around
each
planet
in
the
solar
system
to
keep
watch
i
help
it
better
to
ask
questions
before
i
spout
an
opinion
weve
been
progressing
towards
that
goal
for
years
now
we
precede
any
orbiting
mission
with
flyby
missions
of
course
it
gets
harder
to
do
as
we
work
our
way
farther
away
from
earth
were
just
starting
to
work
out
to
the
outer
planets
galileo
will
orbit
jupiter
and
cassini
around
saturn
how
about
a
mission
unmanned
to
pluto
to
stay
in
orbit
and
record
things
around
and
near
and
on
pluto
well
first
things
first
well
do
a
flyby
mission
first
since
it
is
much
easier
and
faster
to
do
if
the
fast
pluto
flyby
mission
is
approved
then
well
launch
a
pluto
mission
before
the
end
of
the
decade
a
pluto
orbiter
however
requires
a
larger
spacecraft
and
a
longer
cruise
period
orbit
insertion
requires
more
fuel
has
to
be
carried
along
and
restricts
the
trajectory
to
a
slower
approach
velocity
to
pluto
id
imagine
though
that
we
would
be
doing
a
neptune
orbiting
mission
before
a
pluto
orbiting
mission
unless
the
pluto
flyby
turns
up
something
really
interesting
