RE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
DARK
SKY
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
A
REFERENCE
SOMETHING
I
CAN
LOOK
UP
NOT
JUST
YOUR
OWN
RECOLLECTIONS
I
HAVE
A
FEW
OF
THOSE
MYSELF
ON
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
NIGHT
SKY
AS
SEEN
FROM
SPACE
NOTE
I
AM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
MICROWAVE
BACKGROUND
RADIATION
THERE
ARE
MORE
THINGS
IN
THE
SKY
THAN
JUST
THE
MBR
WHAT
IM
AFTER
IS
TOTAL
BLACKBODY
TEMPERATURE
WHAT
A
THERMAL
RADIATOR
WOULD
SEE
DISREGARDING
OR
SHIELDING
AGAINST
THE
SUN
AND
NEARBY
LARGE
WARM
OBJECTS
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
WILL
HELP
YOU
BUT
THE
LOCAL
INTERSTELLAR
RADIATION
FIELD
HAS
BEEN
MEASURED
AND
MODELED
BY
VARIOUS
GROUPS
IF
I
REMEMBER
THINGS
CORRECTLY
THE
MODELS
INVOLVED
CONTRIBUTIONS
FROM
THREE
DIFFERENT
BB
SOURCES
SO
THERES
NO
OBVIOUS
TEMPERATURE
OF
BACKGROUND
RADIATION
IN
OUR
LOCAL
AREA
HOWEVER
THE
FOLLOWING
REFERENCES
GIVE
THE
INTERSTELLAR
RADIATION
DENSITY
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
WAVELENGTH
AND
YOU
CAN
INTEGRATE
AND
AVERAGE
IN
AN
APPROPRIATE
MANNER
TO
GET
AN
EFFECTIVE
TEMPERATURE
IF
YOU

AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
REFERENCES
ARE
OUT
OF

BUT
THEY
MIGHT
GET
YOU
STARTED
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
