RE
SPACE
MARKETING
WOULD
BE
WONDERFULL
IN
SOME
SENSE
I
THINK
THAT
THE
FOLKS
WHO
THINK
THE
IDEA
IS
WONDERFUL
AND
THE
FOLKS
WHO
WANT
TO
BOYCOTT
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THIS
PROJECT
ARE
BOTH
RIGHT
THAT
IS
I
THINK
THAT
SPACE
ADVERTISING
IS
AN
INTERESTING
IDEA
AND
IF
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
TRY
IT
OUT
MORE
POWER
TO
THEM
HOWEVER
A
COMPANY
MAY
DISCOVER
THAT
THE
COST
OF
LAUNCH
IS
NOT
THE
ONLY
COST
OF
ADVERTISING
AND
A
COMPANY
WHO
GAUGED
THAT
ILL
WILL
WOULD
LOSE
THEM
MORE
REVENUE
THAN
THE
ADVERTISING
WOULD
GAIN
MIGHT
DECIDE
TO
BOW
OUT
OF
THE
PROJECT
I
GOT
INCENSED
WHEN
I
READ
THAT
CARL
SAGAN
CALLED
THIS
IDEA
AN
ABOMINATION
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
WORD
MEANS
WHAT
HE
THINKS
IT
DOES
CHILDREN
STARVING
IN
THE
RICHEST
COUNTRY
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
AN
ABOMINATION
AN
AD
AGENCY
IS
AT
WORST
JUST
IN
POOR
TASTE
