HELLO
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
A
PROGRAM
OR
ALGORITHM
THAT
CAN
BE
USED
TO
COMPUTE
SUNRISE
AND
SUNSET
TIMES
HERE
IS
A
COMPUTATION
I
DID
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
THAT
COMPUTES
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
DAYLIGHT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
CONVERT
THE
INFORMATION
HERE
TO
SUNRISE
AND
SUNSET
TIMES
SORRY
NOT
SO
THE
CHANGES
IN
SUNRISE
AND
SUNSET
TIMES
ARE
NOT
QUITE
SYNCHRONIZED
FOR
EXAMPLE
NEITHER
THE
EARLIEST
SUNRISE
NOR
THE
LATEST
SUNSET
COMES
ON
THE
LONGEST
DAY
OF
THE
YEAR
YOU
CAN
DERIVE
DAY
LENGTH
FROM
SUNRISE
AND
SUNSET
TIMES
BUT
NOT
VICEVERSA
