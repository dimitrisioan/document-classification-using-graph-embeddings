other
idea
for
old
space
crafts
is
as
navigation
beacons
and
such
why
not
because
to
be
any
use
as
a
nav
point
you
need
to
know
exactly
where
it
is
which
means
you
either
nail
it
to
something
that
doesnt
move
or
you
watch
it
all
the
time
neither
of
which
is
possible
on
a
deactivated
spacecraft
then
you
have
to
know
exactly
how
far
away
from
it
you
are
this
may
or
may
not
be
possible
with
the
hardware
on
board
apart
from
which
there
is
absolutely
no
need
for
navigation
beacons
