are

dont

my

will
be
very
surprised
if
these
tiny
masses
sitting
very
close
to
jupiter
play
any
role
whatsoever
in
the
problem
or
to
put
it
more
technically
the
extra
volume
they
add
to
the
phase

of
possible
capture

is
negligible
jupiter
is
kg
while
the
galilean
satellites
are
around
also
as
i
said
the
few
references
that
ive
looked
at
do
not
mention
outgassing
or
breakup
as
important
processes
the
important
thing
is
a

reverse
slingshot
that
leads
to
a
weakly

the
