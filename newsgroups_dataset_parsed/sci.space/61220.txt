the
environmental
billboard
is
a
large
inflatable
outer
support
structure
of
up
to
meters
advertising
is
carried
by
a
mylar
reflective
area
deployed
by
the
inflatable
frame
to
help
sell
the
concept
the
spacecraft
responsible
for
maintaining
the
billboard
on
orbit
will
carry
ozone
reading
sensors
to
continuously
monitor
the
condition
of
the
earths
delicate
protective
ozone
layer
according
to
mike
lawson
head
of
smi
furthermore
the
inflatable
billboard
has
reached
its
minimum
exposure
of
days
it
will
be
released
to
reenter
the
earths
atmosphere
according
to
imi
as
the
biodegradable
material
burns
it
will
release
ozonebuilding
components
that
will
literally
replenish
the
ozone
layer
can
we
assume
that
this
guy
studied
advertising
and
not
chemistry
granted
it
probably
a
great
advertising
gimic
but
it
doesnt
sound
at
all
practical
