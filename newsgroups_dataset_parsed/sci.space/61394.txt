actually
my
advisor
another
classmate
of
mine
and
me
were
talking
the
other
day
about
putting
just
one
detector
on
one
of
the
pluto
satellites
then
we
realized
that
the
satellite
alone
is
only
carrying
something
like
pounds
of
eq
well
a
batse
detector
needs
lead
shielding
to
protect
it
and
alone
weighs
about
pounds
itself
actually
the
situation
is
even
worse
than
that
the
total
mass
of
the
pluto
fast
flyby
spacecraft
is
only
pounds
and
most
of
that
is
support
equipment
like
power
and
communications
the
mass
available
for
instruments
is
maybe
of
that
i
dont
think
a
batse
will
fit
from
the
pluto
fast

ultrastable
means
this
doesnt
leave
much
room
for
payloads
which
are
totally
unrelated
to
the
mission
of
the
spacecraft
in
addition
the
power
will
come
from
a
radioisotope
thermal
generator
and
the
whole
space
craft
will
be
about
feet
in
diameter
with
no
booms
which
means
there
will
be
strong
gammalines
from
and
associated
schmutz
in
the
background
which
tends
to
reduce
sensitivity
somewhat
it
would
still
be
nice
and
our
group
here
at
goddard
is
looking
in
to
it
