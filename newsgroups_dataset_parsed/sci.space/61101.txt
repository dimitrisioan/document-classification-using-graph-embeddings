WRITES
I
WAS
READING
POPULAR
SCIENCE

MORNING
AND
WAS
SURPRISED
BY
AN
AD
IN
THE
BACK
I
KNOW

A
LOT
OF
THE
ADS
IN
THE
BACK
OF
PS
ARE
FRINGE
SCIENCE
OR
QUESTIONABLELY
LEGAL
BUT
THIS
ONE
REALLY
GRABBED

ASIDE
FROM
THE
OBVIOUS
DANGERS
TO
ANY
AMATEUR
ROCKETEER
USING
ONE
OF
THESE
BEASTS
ISNT
THIS
ILLEGAL
I
CANT
IMAGINE
THE
FAA
ALLOWING
PEOPLE
TO
SHOOT
ROCKETS
UP
THROUGH
THE
FLIGHT
LEVELS
OF
PASSENGER
PLANES
NOT
TO
EVEN
MENTION
THE
PROBLEM
OF
LOCATING
A
ROCKET
WHEN
IT
COMES
DOWN
NOPE
ITS
NOT
ILLEGAL
IT
IS
HOWEVER
CLOSELY
REGULATED

IS
RELATIVELY
LIGHT
SUCH
AS
OVER
THE
WESTERN
DESERTS
THE
BLACK
