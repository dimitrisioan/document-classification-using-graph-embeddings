WRITES
NOW
SPACE
MARKETING
IS
WORKING
WITH
UNIVERSITY
OF
COLORADO
AND
LIVERMORE
ENGINEERS
ON
A
PLAN
TO
PLACE
A
MILELONG
INFLATABLE
BILLBOARD
IN
LOWEARTH
ORBIT
NASA
WOULD
PROVIDE
CONTRACTUAL
LAUNCH
SERVICES
HOWEVER
SINCE
NASA
BASES
ITS
CHARGE
ON
SERIOUSLY
FLAWED
COST
ESTIMATES
WN
MAR
THE
TAXPAYERS
WOULD
BEAR
MOST
OF
THE
EXPENSE
THIS
MAY
LOOK
LIKE
ENVIRONMENTAL
VANDALISM
BUT
MIKE
LAWSON
CEO
OF
SPACE
MARKETING
TOLD
US
YESTERDAY
THAT
THE
REAL
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PROJECT
IS
TO
HELP
THE
ENVIRONMENT
THE
PLATFORM
WILL
CARRY
OZONE
MONITORS
HE
EXPLAINEDADVERTISING
IS
JUST
TO
HELP
DEFRAY
COSTS
HOW
COULD
THIS
POSSIBLY
BE
ENVIRONMENTAL
VANDALISM
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
ENVIRONMENT
TO
VANDALIZE
UP
THERE
SINCE
THE
ADVERTISING
IS
JUST
TO
HELP
DEFRAY
COSTS
ITS
CERTAINLY
NO
SURPRISE
THAT
THE
TAXPAYERS
WOULD
BEAR
MOST
OF
THE
EXPENSE
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
ME
SINCE
THE
TAXPAYERS
WOULD
BEAR
ALL
OF
THE
EXPENSE
IF
THEY
DIDNT
DO
THE
ADVERTISING
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
OF
THIS
REVOLTING
AND
HIDEOUS
ATTEMPT
TO
VANDALIZE
THE
NIGHT
SKY
GREAT
IDEA
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
DONE
IT
LONG
AGO
WHAT
ABOUT
LIGHT
POLLUTION
IN
OBSERVATIONS
I
READ
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
THAT
IT
MIGHT
EVEN
BE
VISIBLE
DURING
THE
DAY
LEAVE
ALONE
AT
NIGHT
I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
A
MILELONG
BILLBOARD
WOULD
HAVE
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
EFFECT
ON
THE
OVERALL
SKY
BRIGHTNESS
VENUS
IS
VISIBLE
DURING
THE
DAY
BUT
NOBODY
COMPLAINS
ABOUT
THAT
BESIDES
ITS
IN
LEO
SO
IT
WOULD
ONLY
BE
VISIBLE
DURING
TWILIGHT
WHEN
THE
SKY
IS
ALREADY
BRIGHT
AND
EVEN
IF
IT
WOULD
HAVE
SOME
MINISCULE
IMPACT
IT
WOULD
BE
ONLY
FOR
A
SHORT
TIME
AS
IT
GOES
ZIPPING
ACROSS
THE
SKY
ARE
PROTESTING
GROUPS
BEING
ORGANIZED
IN
THE
STATES
NO
DOUBT
PEOPLE
ARE
ALWAYS
LOOKING
FOR
SOMETHING
TO
PROTEST
ABOUT
SO
IT
WOULD
BE
NO
SURPRISE
REALLY
REALLY
DEPRESSED
WELL
LOOK
ON
THE
ER
BRIGHT
SIDE
IMAGINE
THE
LOOKS
ON
THE
FACES
OF
PEOPLE
IN
PRIMITIVE
TRIBES
OUT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
NOWHERE
AS
THEY
LOOK
UP
AND
SEE
A
CAN
OF
BUDWEISER
FLYING
ACROSS
THE
SKY
