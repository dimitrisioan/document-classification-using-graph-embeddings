effects
of
spaceflight
to

human
being
i
love
this
topic
as
some
of
you
regulars
know
so
having
seen
henrys
encouraging
statement
about
starting
to
talk
about
it
i
shall
i
feel
that
we
as
a
community
of
people
have
unique
resources
to
deliver
to
the
world
a
comprehensive
book
which
can
elaborate
on
the
utility
of
spaceflight
to
fields
which
are
as
divergent
as
medical
intensive
care
agriculture
environmental
protection
and
probably
more
i
do
not
believe
that
the
general
public
understands
the
impact
of
spaceflight
on
the
whole
of
society
in
the
absence
of
such
knowledge
we
see
dwindling
support
of
