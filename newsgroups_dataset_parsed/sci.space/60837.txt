there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
stable
lunar
orbit
is
it
right
that
is
new
stuff
for
me
so
it
means
that
you
just
can
not
put
a
sattellite
around
around
the
moon
for
too
long
because
its
orbit
will
be
unstable
if
so
what
is
the
reason
is
that
because
the
combined
gravitacional
atraction
of
the
sunmoon
and
earth
that
does
not
provide
a
stable
orbit
around
the
moon
any
lunar
satellite
needs
fuel
to
do
regular
orbit
corrections
and
when
its
fuel
runs
out
it
will
crash
within
months
the
orbits
of
the
apollo
motherships
changed
noticeably
during
lunar
missions
lasting
only
a
few
days
it
is
possible
that
there
are
stable
orbits
here
and
there
the
moons
gravitational
field
is
poorly
mapped
but
we
know
of
none
perturbations
from
sun
and
earth
are
relatively
minor
issues
at
low
altitudes
the
big
problem
is
that
the
moons
own
gravitational
field
is
quite
lumpy
due
to
the
irregular
distribution
of
mass
within
the
moon
all
work
is
one
mans
work
