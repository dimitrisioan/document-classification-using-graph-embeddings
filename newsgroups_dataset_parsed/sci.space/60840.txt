re
guns
for
space
okay
lets
get
the
record
straight
on
the
livermore
gas
gun
the
project
manager
is
dr
john
hunter
and
he
works
for
the
laser
group
at
livermore
what
you
may
ask
does
gas
guns
have
to
do
with
lasers
nothing
really
but
the
gun
is
physically
located
across
the
road
from
the
free
electron
laser
building
and
the
fel
building
has
a
heavily
shielded
control
room
thick
walls
from
which
the
gun
firings
are
controlled
so
i
suspect
that
the
office
he
works
for
is
an
administrative
convenience
i
visited
hunter
at
the
beginning
of
feb
and
we
toured
the
gun
at
the
time
i
was
working
on
gas
gun
rd
at
boeing
where
i
work
but
i
am
now
doing
other
things
helping
to
save
the
space
station
the
gun
uses
a
methaneair
mixture
which
is
burned
in
a
chamber
about
ft
long
by
inch
id
ie
it
looks
like
a
pipe
the
chamber
holds
a
ton
piston
which
is
propelled
at
several
hundred
ms
down
the
chamber
on
the
other
side
of
the
piston
is
hudrogen
gas
initially
at
room
temperature
andsome
tens
of
atmospheres
the
piston
compresses
and
heats
the
hydrogen
ahead
of
it
until
a
stainless
steel
burst
diaphragm
ruptures
at
around
psi
the
barrel
of
the
gun
is
about
feet
long
and
has
a
inch
bore
it
is
mounted
at
right
angles
to
the
chamber
ie
they
intersect
this
was
done
so
that
in
the
future
the
barrel
could
be
raised
and
the
gun
fired
into
the
air
without
having
to
move
the
larger
and
heavier
chamber
the
projectile
being
used
in
testing
is
a
kg
cylinder
of
lexan
plastic
in
in
diameter
and
about
cm
long
all
of
the
acceleration
comes
from
the
expansion
of
the
hydrogen
gas
from
psi
downwards
until
the
projectile
leaves
the
barrel
the
barrel
is
evacuated
and
the
end
is
sealed
with
a
sheet
of
plastic
film
a
little
thicker
than
saran
wrap
the
plastic
is
blown
off
by
the
small
amount
of
residual
air
trapped
in
the
barrel
ahead
of
the
projectile
the
gun
is
fired
into
a
bunker
filled
with
sandbags
and
plastic
water
jugs
in
the
early
testing
fragments
of
the
plastic
projectile
were
found
at
the
higher
speeds
in
later
testing
the
projectile
vaporizes
the
testing
is
into
a
bunker
because
the
livermore
test
range
is
about
miles
across
and
the
projectile
would
go
km
if
fired
for
maximum
range
the
intent
is
to
move
the
whole
gun
to
vandenberg
afb
after
the
testing
is
complete
where
they
can
fire
into
the
pacific
ocean
and
use
the
tracking
radar
at
vafb
to
follow
the
projectiles
the
design
goal
of
the
gun
is
to
throw
a
kg
projectile
at
kms
half
of
orbital
speed
so
far
they
have
reached
kms
and
the
gun
is
currently
down
for
repairs
as
on
the
last
test
they
blew
a
seal
and
damaged
some
of
the
hardware
i
think
it
had
to
do
with
the
methaneair
more
detonating
than
burning
but
i
havent
had
a
chance
to
talk
to
hunter
directly
on
this
there
are
people
waiting
to
test
scramjet
components
in
this
gun
by
firing
then
out
of
the
gun
into
the
air
at
mach
kms
since
the
most
you
can
get
in
wind
tunnels
is
mach
this
gun
cost
about
million
to
develop
and
is
basically
a
proofofconcept
for
a
bigger
gun
capable
of
firing
useful
sized
payloads
into
space
this
would
require
on
the
order
of
kg
projectiles
which
deliver
on
the
order
of
kg
useful
payload
to
orbit
