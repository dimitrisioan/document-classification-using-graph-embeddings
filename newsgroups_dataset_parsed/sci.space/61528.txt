IF
YOURE
DOING
LARGESCALE
SATELLITE
SERVICING
BEING
ABLE
TO
DO
IT
IN
A
PRESSURIZED
HANGAR
MAKES
CONSIDERABLE
SENSE
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
ANYONE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
DOING
LARGESCALE
SATELLITE
SERVICING
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
TO
THE
POINT
OF
JUSTIFYING
DEVELOPMENT
OF
SUCH
A
THING
THATS
A
MIGHTY
FINE
IDEA
BUT
SINCE
YOU
ASKED
WHY
NOT
ILL
RESPOND
PUTTING
ASIDE
THE
APPLICATION
OF
SUCH
A
SPACE
DOCK
THERE
ARE
OTHER
FACTORS
TO
CONSIDER
THAN
JUST
PRESSURIZED
VOLUME
TEMPERATURE
CONTROL
IS
DIFFICULT
IN
SPACE
AND
YOUR
INFLATABLE
HANGAR
WILL
HAVE
TO
INCORPORATE
THERMAL
INSULATION
MAYBE
A
DOUBLEWALLED
INFLATABLE
MICROMETEOROID
PROTECTION
AND
RADIATION
PROTECTION
ARE
ALSO
REQUIRED
DONT
THINK
THIS
WILL
BE
A
CLEAR
PLASTIC
BUBBLE
ITS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
LOOK
LIKE
A
BIG
WHITE
BALL
MADE
OUT
OF
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
MULTILAYER
FABRIC
THAT
SOFTTORSO
SPACE

ARE
MADE
OUT
OF

BECAUSE
ALMOST

EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
HAD
HAVE
METAL
SKINS
THEY
STILL
KIND
OF
QUALIFY
AS
INFLATABLE
THE
INFLATION
PROCESS
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFULLY
CONTROLLED
THE
SPACE
ENVIRONMENT
REDUCES
DUCTILITY
IN
EXPOSED
MATERIALS
DUE
TO
TEMPERATURE
EXTREMES
MONOTOMIC
OXYGEN
IMPINGEMENT
AND
RADIATION
EFFECTS
ON
MATERIALS
SO
YOUR
FABRIC
MAY
NOT
RETAIN
ANY
FLEXIBILITY
FOR
LONG
THIS
MAY
NOT
MATTER
EVEN
AFTER
INFLATION
PRESSURE
CHANGES
IN
THE
HANGAR
MAY
CAUSE
FLEXING
IN
THE
FABRIC
WHICH
COULD
LEAD
TO
HOLES
AND
TEARS
AS
DUCTILITY
DECREASES
THESE
ARE
SOME
OF
THE
TECHNICAL
DIFFICULTIES

THE
