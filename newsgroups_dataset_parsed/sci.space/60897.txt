RE
WHAT
IF
THE
USSR
HAD
REACHED
THE
MOON
FIRST
IN

THIS
IS
TURNING
INTO
WHATS
A
MOONBASE
GOOD
FOR
AND
I
OUGHT
NOT
TO
POST
WHEN
IVE
A
HUNDRED
SOME
ODD
POSTS
TO
GO
BUT
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THE
REAL
REASON
TO
HAVE
A
MOON
BASE
IS
ECONOMIC
SINCE
SOMEONE
WITH
SPACE
INDUSTRY
WILL
PRESUMEABLY
HAVE
A
MUCH
LARGER
GNP
THAN
THEY
WOULD
WITHOUT
SPACE
INDUSTRY
EVENTUALLY
THEY
WILL
SIMPLY
BE
ABLE
TO
AFFORD
MORE
STUFF
IF
I
READ
YOU
RIGHT
YOURE
SAYING
IN
ESSENCE
THAT
WITH
A
LARGER
ECONOMY
NATIONS
WILL
HAVE
MORE
DISCRETIONARY
FUNDS
TO
WASTE
ON
A
LUNAR
FACILITY
THAT
WAS
CERTAINLY
PARTIALLY
THE
CASE
WITH
APOLLO
BUT
REAL
LUNAR
COLONIES
WILL
PROBABLY
REQUIRE
A
CONTINUING
MILITARY
SCIENTIFIC
OR
COMMERCIAL
REASON
FOR
BEING
RATHER
THAN
JUST
A
WE
HAVE
THE
MONEY
WHY
NOT
APPROACH
AH
BUT
THE
WHOLE
POINT
IS
THAT
MONEY
SPENT
ON
A
LUNAR
BASE
IS
NOT
WASTED
ON
THE
MOON
ITS
NOT
LIKE
THEYD
BE
USING
BILLS
TO
FUEL
THEIR
MOONDOZERS
THE
MONEY
TO
FUND
A
LUNAR
BASE
WOULD
BE
SPENT
IN
THE
COUNTRY
TO
WHICH
THE
BASE
BELONGED
ITS
A
WAY
OF
FUNDING
HIGHTECH
RESEARCH
JUST
LIKE
DARPA
WAS
A
GOOD
EXCUSE
TO
FUND
VARIOUS
FIELDS
OF
RESEARCH
UNDER
THE
PRETENSE
THAT
IT
WAS
CRUCIAL
TO
THE
DEFENSE
OF
THE
COUNTRY
OR
LIKE
ESPRIT
IS
A
GOOD
EXCUSE
FOR
THE
EC
TO
FUND
RESEARCH
UNDER
THE
PRETENSE
THAT
ITS
GOOD
FOR
PANEUROPEAN
COOPERATION
NOW
MAYBE
YOU
THINK
THAT
GOVERNMENTFUNDED
RESEARCH
IS
A
WASTE
OF
MONEY
IN
FACT
IM
PRETTY
SURE
YOU
DO
BUT
IT
DOES
COUNT
AS
INVESTMENT
SPENDING
WHICH
DOES
BOOST
THE
ECONOMY
AND
JUST
LOOK
AT
THE
SIZE
OF
THAT
