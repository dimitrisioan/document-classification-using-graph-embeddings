WRITES
HERE
IS
A
WAY
TO
GET
THE
COMMERICIAL
COMPANIES
INTO
SPACE
AND
MINERAL
EXPLORATION
BASICALLY
GET
THE
ECIFREAKS
TO
MAKE
IT
SO
HARD
TO
GET
THE
MINERALS
ON
EARTH
YOU
THINK
THIS
IS
CRAZY
WELL
IN
A
WAY
IT
IS
BUT
IN
A
WAY
IT
IS
REALITY
THERE
IS
A
BILLIN
THE
CONGRESS
TO
DO
JUST
THAT
BASICALLY
TO
MAKE
IT
SO
EXPENSIVE
TO
MINE
MINERALS
IN
THE
US
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
BY
OFF
THE
INSPECTORS
OR
TAX
COLLECTORS
ASCIALLY
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
FROM
TALKING
TO
A
FEW
MINER
FRIENDS
OF
MINE
THAT
THEY
THE
CONGRESS
PROPOSE
TO
HAVE
A
TAX
ON
THE
GROSS
INCOME
OF
THE
MINE
VERSUS
THE
ADJUSTED
INCOME
ALSO
THE
STATE
GOVERNMENTS
HAVE
THERE
NORMAL
TAXES
SO
BY
THE
TIME
YOU
GET
DONE
PAYING
FOR
MATERIALS
WORKERS
AND
OTHER
EXPENSES
YOU
CAN
OWE
MORE
THAN
WHAT
YOU
MADE
BASICALLY
IF
YOU
MAKE
A
AND
SPEND
OFOR
EXPENSES
YOU
CAN
OWE
IN
FEDERAL
TAXES
BASCIALLY
IT
IS
DRIVING
THE
MINERS
OFF
THE
LAND
AND
THE
ONLY
PEOPEL
WHO
BENEFIT
ARE
THE
ECOFREAKS
BASICALLY
TO
GET
BACK
TO
MY
BEGINNING
STATEMENT
IS
SPACE
IS
THE
WAY
TO
GO
CAUSE
IT
MIGHT
JUST
GET
TO
EXPENSIVE
TO
MINE
ON
EARTH
BECAUSE
OF
EITHER
THE
ECOFREAKS
OR
THE
PROTECTIONIST
SUCH
FUN
WE
HAVE
IN
THESE
INTERESTING
TIMES
MICHAEL
ADAMS
IM
NOT
HIGH
JUST
JACKED
THE
CURRENT
MINING
REGULATIONS
AND
FEES
WERE
SET
IN
THE
WHAT
THE
SOCALLED
ECOFREAKS
WANT
TO
DO
IS
TO
SIMPLY
BRING
THOSE
FEES
IN
LINE
WITH
CURRENT
ECONOMIC
REALITY
CURRENTLY
MINING
COMPANIES
CAN
GET
ACCESS
TO
MINERALS
ON
PUBLIC
LANDS
FOR
RIDICULOUSLY
LOW
PRICES
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
MINING
LOBBY
HAS
FOR
DECADES
MANAGED
TO
BLOCK
ANY
REFORM
OF
THESE
OUTDATED
FEES
IN
FACT
THE
LATEST
ATTEMPT
TO
REFORM
THEM
WAS
AGAIN
BLOCKED
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
COMPROMISED
BY
TAKING
THE
MINING
FEE
REFORMS
OUT
OF
HIS
BUDGET
AND
PLANS
TO
DRAFT
SEPARATE
LEGISLATION
TO
FIGHT
THAT
BATTLE
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
DISCUSS
THIS
FURTHER
I
SUGGEST
YOU
TAKE
