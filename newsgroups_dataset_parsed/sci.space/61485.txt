RE
SPACE
SPINN
OFFS
DATE
APR
GMT
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
TEFLON
WASNT
FROM
THE
SPACE
PROGRAM
IT
WAS
FROM
THE
WWII
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
DEVELOPMENT
PROGRAM
PIPES
IN
THE
SYSTEM
FOR
FRACTIONING
AND
ENRICHING
URANIUM
HAD
TO
BE
LINED
WITH
IT
URANIUM
HEXAFLORIDE
WAS
THE
CHEMICAL
THEY
TURNED
THE
PITCHBLEND
INTO
FOR
ENRICHMENT
IT
IS
MASSIVELY
CORROSIVE
EVEN
TO
STAINLESS
STEELS
HENCE
THE
NEED
FOR
A
VERY
INERT
SUBSTAANCE
TO
LINE
THE
PIPES
WITH
TEFLON
HAS
ALL
ITS
MOLECULAR
SOCKETS
BOUND
UP
ALREADY
SO
IT
IS
VERY
UNREACTIVE
MY
SENSE
WORTH
BILL
THE
ARTIFICAL
PACEMAKER
WAS
INVENTED
IN
BY
WILSON
GREATBATCH
AN
AMERICAN
BIOMEDICAL
ENGINEER
THE
BILL
AUTHORIZING
NASA
WAS
SIGNED
IN
OCTOBER
OF
SO
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
NASA
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
INVENTION
OF
THE
PACEMAKER
