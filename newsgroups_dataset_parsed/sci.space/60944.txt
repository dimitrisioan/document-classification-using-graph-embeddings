WRITES
ON
MONDAY
MORNING
APRIL
THE
MOON
WILL
OCCULT
VENUS
AND
INTERRUPT
THE
TRACKING
OF
MAGELLAN
FOR
ABOUT
MINUTES
WILL
THIS
MEAN
A
LOSS
OF
DATA
OR
WILL
THE
MAGELLAN
TRANSMIT
DATA
LATER
ON
THE
GRAVITY
DATA
IS
COLLECTED
IN
REALTIME
AND
IT
NOT
RECORDED
TO
THE
TAPE
RECORDER
HOWEVER
YOU
ONLY
NEED
TO
COLLECT
THE
GRAVITY
EVERY
OR
ORBIT
SO
THERE
IS
NO
REAL
DATA
LOSS
IF
THE
MOON
BLOCKS
TRANSMISSION
FOR
A
SHORT
WHILE
BTW
WHEN
WILL
NASA
CUT
OFF
THE
CONNECTION
WITH
MAGELLAN
NOT
THAT
I
AM
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
THAT
DAY
BUT
I
AM
JUST
CURIOUS
I
BELIEVE
IT
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
FUNDING
FROM
THE
GOVERMENT
OR
RATHER
NO
FUNDING
THE
AEROBRAKING
STARTS
MAY
AND
IS
EXPECTED
LAST
ABOUT
DAYS
IF
THE
FUNDING
IS
PROVIDED
MILLION
DOLLARS
TO
EXTEND
THE
MISSION
FOR
THE
HIGH
RESOLUTION
GRAVITY
DATA
THEN
THE
MISSION
WILL
LAST
THROUGH
OCTOBER
OTHERWISE
THE
MISSION
WILL
END
THIS
COMING
JULY
