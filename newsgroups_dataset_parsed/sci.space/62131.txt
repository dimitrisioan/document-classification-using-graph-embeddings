sure
which
amazes
me
more
the
fact
that
someone
would
go
to
all
this
trouble
to
write
about
mcelwaine
or
the
fact
that
someone
would
post
something
which
repeatedly
says
it
shouldnt
be
posted
its
all
moot
anyway
he
had
is
net
access
privileges
revoked
last
week
josh
hopkins
find
a
way
or
make
one
attributed
to
hannibal
mcelwaine
got
his
access
revoked
finally
and
they
say
it
couldnt
be
done

we
can
rid
the
net
of
mcelwaine
then
anything
is
possible
