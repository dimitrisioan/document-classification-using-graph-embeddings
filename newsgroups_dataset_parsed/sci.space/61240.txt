voyager
has
the
unusual
luck
to
be
on
a
stable
trajectory
out
of
the
solar
system
all
its
doing
is
collecting
fields
data
and
routinely
squirting
it
down
one
of
the
mariners
is
also
in
stable
solar
orbit
and
still
providing
similiar
solar
data
there
are
no
mariner
craft
from
which
we
are
still
receiving
data
i
believe
you
are
referring
to
one
or
more
of
pioneers
through
launched
from
december
through
november
which
were
put
into
solar
orbits
to
study
interplanetary
space
i
recall
reading
that
at
least
one
of
them
was
still
functioning
years
after
launch
