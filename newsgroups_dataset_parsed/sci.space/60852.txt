WE
ARE
NOT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SPACE
AGE
BUT
ONLY
AT
THE
END
OF
ITS
BEGINNING
THAT
SPACE
EXPLORATION
IS
NO
LONGER
A
DRIVER
FOR
TECHNICAL
INNOVATION
OR
A
FOCUS
OF
AMERICAN
CULTURAL
ATTENTION
IS
CERTAINLY
DEBATABLE
HOWEVER
TECHNICAL
DEVELOPMENTS
IN
OTHER
QUARTERS
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
EXAMINED
FOR
POSSIBLE
APPLICATIONS
IN
THE
SPACE
AREA
AND
WE
CAN
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
MANY
INNOVATIONS
THAT
MIGHT
ENHANCE
THE
CAPABILITIES
AND
LOWER
THE
COST
OF
FUTURE
SPACE
OPERATIONS
THE
DREAM
IS
ALIVE
AND
WELL
