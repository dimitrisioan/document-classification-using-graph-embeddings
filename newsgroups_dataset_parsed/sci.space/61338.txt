RE
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTERS
WHERE
ARE
THEY
WELL
I
SEEM
TO
HAVE
STRUCK
AN
INTERESTING
DISCUSSION
OFF
GIVEN
THAT
I
AM
NOT
AN
ASTROPHYSICIST
OR
NUCLEAR
PHYSICIST
ILL
HAVE
TO
BOIL
IT
DOWN
A
BIT
ALL
THE
DATA
ON
BURSTS
TO
DATE
SHOWS
A
SMOOTH
RANDOM
DISTRIBUTION
THAT
MEANS
THEY
ARENT
CONCENTRATED
IN
GALACTIC
CORES
OUR
OR
SOMEONE
ELSES
IF
THE
DISTRIBUTION
IS
SMOOTH
WE
ARE
EITHER
SEEING
SOME
ENORMOUSLY
LARGE
PHENOMENA
SCATTERED
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
SAID
PHENOMENA
BEING
SUBJECT
TO
DEBATE
ALMOST
AS
VIOENT
AS
THE
PHENOMENA
OR
WE
ARE
SEEING
SOME
PHENOMENA
OUT
AT
LIKE
THE
OORT
CLOUD
BUT
THEN
IT
NEEDS
SOME
POTENT
LITTLE
ENERGY
SOURCE
THAT
ISNT
DETECTABLE
BY
ANY
OTHER
CURRENT
METHODS
WE
KNOW
ITS
NOT
REAL
CLOSE
LIKE
SLIGHTLY
EXTRA
SOLAR
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
NO
PARALLAX
MEASUREMENTS
ON
THE
BURSTS
THE
BURSTS
SEEM
TO
BRIGHT
TO
BE
SOMETHING
LIKE
BLACK
HOLE
QUANTA
OR
SUPER
STRING
IMPACTS
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
SO
EVERYONE
IS
WATCHING
THE
DATA
AND
ARGUING
LIKE
MAD
IN
THE
MEANWHILE
WHAT
I
AM
WONDERING
IS
THIS
IN
PEOPLES
OPINION
A
NEW
PHYSICS
PROBLEM
EINSTEIN
GOT
WELL
KNOWN
FOR
SOLVINGTHE
PHOTOELECTRIC
EFFECT
COPERNICUS
STARTED
LOOKING
AT
IRREGULARITIES
IN
PLANETARY
MOTION
IS
THIS
A
BIG
ENOUGH
PROBLEM
TO
CREATE
A
NEW
AREA
OF
PHYSICS
JUST
A
LITTLE
SPECULATIVE
THINKING
FOLKS
PAT
