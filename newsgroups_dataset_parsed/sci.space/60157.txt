think
this
would
be
a

way
to

unfortunately
current
spending
rules
dont
permit
it
to
be
workable
for
this
to
work
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
government
to
guarantee
a
certain
minimum
amount
of
business
in
order
to
sufficiently
reduce
the
risk
enough
to
make
this
attractive
to
a
private
firm
since
they
generally
cant
allocate
money
except
one
year
at
a
time
the
government
cant
provide
such
a

guarantee
fred
try
reading
a
bit
the
government
does
lots
of
multi
year
contracts
with
penalty
for
cancellation
clauses
they
just
like
to
be
damn
sure
they
know
what
they
are
doing
before
they
sign
a
multi
year
contract
the
reason
they
arent
cutting
defense
spending
as
much
as
they
would
like
is
the
reagan
administration
signed
enough
multi
year
contracts
that
its
now
cheaper
to
just
finish
them
out
look
at
ssf
this
years
funding
is
billion
of
which
will
cover
penalty
clauses
due
to
the
redesign
