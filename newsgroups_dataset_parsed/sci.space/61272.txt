UPDATE
BACK
TO
THE
MOON
BILL
INTRODUCING
THE
BACK
TO
THE
MOON
IN
CONGRESS
THE
NEXT
STEP
THE
NEXT
KEY
HURDLE
FOR
THE
LUNAR
RESOURCES
DATA
PURCHASE
ACT
IS
INTRODUCTION
OF
THE
ACT
IN
CONGRESS
AT
THIS
POINT
MANY
CONGRESSPERSONS
HAVE
BEEN
APPROACHED
ABOUT
THE
BILL
HOWEVER
FOR
A
SUCCESSFUL
EFFORT
TO
PASS
THE
BILL
WE
NEED
THE
BEST
POSSIBLE
CONGRESSPERSON
TO
INTRODUCE
THE
BILL
DUE
TO
HIS
POSITION
AS
CHAIR
OF
THE
HOUSE
COMMITTEE
ON
SPACE
AND
SCIENCE
CONGRESSMAN
GEORGE
BROWN
IS
THE
LOGICAL
CHOICE
HE
HAS
A
LONG
RECORD
OF
SUPPORT
AND
INTEREST
IN
SPACE
DEVELOPMENT
AND
HELPED
PASS
THE
LAUNCH
SERVICES
PURCHASE
ACT
AND
THE
SPACE
SETTLEMENTS
ACT
THERE
IS
A
SMALL
GROUP
OF
ACTIVISTS
IN
SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA
WHO
HAVE
ASSISTED
GEORGE
BROWN
IN
HIS
RECENT
REELECTION
CAMPAIGNS
WE
ARE
MOBILIZING
THIS
GROUP
TO
HAVE
THEM
TELL
CONGRESSMAN
BROWN
ABOUT
THE
BACK
TO
THE
MOON
BILL
WE
ARE
ALSO
ASKING
PROSPACE
CONSTITUENTS
TO
LET
HIM
KNOW
THAT
THEY
CARE
ABOUT
GETTING
AMERICA
BACK
TO
THE
MOON
FINALLY
THERE
IS
A
GOOD
CHANCE
THAT
A
NATIONWIDE
ALERT
FOR
SPACE
ACTIVISTS
TO
CALL
OR
WRITE
GEORGE
BROWN
TO
HAVE
HIM
INTRODUCE
THE
BACK
TO
THE
MOON
BILL
MAY
BE
STAGED
DURING
LATE
SPRING
ALL
THIS
SHOULD
PRODUCE
A
POSITIVE
REACTION
FROM
BROWNS
OFFICE
AS
MORE
IS
KNOWN
IT
WILL
BE
PASSED
ON
HOWEVER
EVEN
IF
WE
ARE
SUCCESSFUL
IN
GETTING
HIM
TO
SUPPORT
THE
BILL
THIS
ALONE
WILL
NOT
ENSURE
PASSAGE
OF
THE
BILL
FOR
ANY
BILL
TO
BECOME
LAW
ONE
OF
THREE
CONDITIONS
MUST
EXIST
EITHER
THE
BILL
MUST
REFLECT
WIDESPREAD
NATIONAL
SUPPORT
FOR
AN
ISSUE
SUCH
AS
EXTENSION
OF
UNEMPLOYMENT
INSURANCE
BENEFITS
BE
PROPELLED
BY
HIGHPRICED
LOBBYISTS
WERE
OUT
OF
LUCK
THERE
OR
HAVE
WIDESPREAD
SUPPORT
WITHIN
CONGRESS
DUE
TO
SMALL
BUT
WIDESPREAD
CONSTITUENT
SUPPORT
THE
LATTER
IS
THE
PATH
THAT
WE
BY
NECESSITY
MUST
CHOOSE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
THE
LUNAR
RESOURCES
DATA
PURCHASE
ACT
MUST
BE
IMMEDIATELY
ACCOMPANIED
BY
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
CONGRESSPERSONS
SPONSORSHIP
OF
THE
BILL
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THIS
WE
NEED
ACTIVISTS
TO
ASK
THEIR
CONGRESSPERSON
TO
SUPPORT
THE
LUNAR
RESOURCES
DATA
PURCHASE
ACT
NOW
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
THE
BILL
IS
INTRODUCED
IS
SIMPLY
TOO
LATE
IT
TAKES
TIME
TO
HAVE
A
CONGRESSPERSONS
STAFF
REVIEW
A
BILL
IF
YOUR
CONGRESSPERSON
MENTIONS
THAT
THE
BILL
IS
NOT
YET
INTRODUCED
PLEASE

OPINION
OF
THE
BILL
AS
