WRITES
EXCELLENT
DISCUSSION
OF
DCX
LANDING
TECHNIQUES
BY
HENRY
DELETED
SINCE
THE
DCX
IS
TO
TAKE
OFF
HORIZONTAL
WHY
NOT
LAND
THAT
WAY
THE
DCX
WILL
NOT
TAKE
OF
HORIZONTALLY
IT
TAKES
OF
VERTICALLY
WHY
DO
THE
MARTIAN
LANDING
THING
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
VERTICAL
LANDINGS
DONT
REQUIRE
MILES
OF
RUNWAY
AND
LIMIT
NOISE
POLLUTION
THEY
DONT
REQUIRE
WHEELS
OR
WINGS
JUST
TURN
ON
THE
ENGINES
AND
TOUCH
DOWN
OF
COURSE
AS
HENRY
POINTED
OUT
VETICAL
LANDINGS
ARENT
QUITE
THAT
SIMPLE
OR
AM
I
MISSING
SOMETHING
DONT
KNOW
TO
MUCH
ABOUT
DCX
AND
SUCH
OVERLY
OBVIOUS
WELL
TO
BE
BLUNT
YES
BUT
AT
LEAST
YOURE
LEARNING
WHY
NOT
JUST
FALL
TO
EARTH
LIKE
THE
RUSSIAN
CRAFTS
PARACHUTE
IN
THEN
THE
SOYUZ
VEHICLES
USE
PARACHUTES
FOR
THE
DESCENT
AND
THEN
FIRE
SMALL
ROCKETS
JUST
BEFORE
THEY
HIT
THE
GROUND
PARACHUTES
ARE
HOWEVER
NOT
ESPECIALLY
PRACTICAL
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
REUSE
SOMETHING
WITHOUT
MUCH
EFFORT
THE
LANDINGS
ARE
ALSO
NOT
VERY
COMFORTABLE
HOWEVER
IN
THE
WORDS
OF
GEORGY
GRECHKO
I
PREFER
TO
HAVE
BRUISES
NOT
TO
SINK
