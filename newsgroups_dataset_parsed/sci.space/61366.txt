ARE
BREATHABLE
LIQUIDS
POSSIBLE
I
REMEMBER
SEEING
AN
OLD
NOVA
OR
THE
NATURE
OF
THINGS
WHERE
THIS
IDEA
WAS
TOUCHED
UPON
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
SOME
OTHER
TV
SHOW
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
I
KNOW
SUCH
LIQUIDS
ARE
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
THEY
SHOWED
A
LARGE
GLASS
FULL
OF
THIS
LIQUID
AND
PUT
A
WHITE
MOUSE
RAT
IN
IT
SINCE
THE
LIQUID
WAS
NOT
DENSE
THE
MOUSE
WOULD
FLOAT
SO
IT
WAS
HELD
DOWN
BY
TONGS
CLUTCHING
ITS
TAIL
THE
THING
STRUGGLED
QUITE
A
BIT
BUT
IT
WAS
CERTAINLY
HELD
DOWN
LONG
ENOUGH
SO
THAT
IT
WAS
BREATHING
THE
LIQUID
IT
NEVER
DID
SLOW
DOWN
IN
ITS
FRANTIC
ATTEMPTS
TO
SWIM
TO
THE
TOP
NOW
THIS
MAY
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
THE
MOST
HUMANE
OF
DEMONSTRATIONS
BUT
IT
CERTAINLY
SHOWS
BREATHABLE
LIQUIDS
CAN
BE
MADE

KEEP

BIG
THIS
WAS
ON
THATS
INCREDIBLE
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
THE
VOLUME
OF
LIQUID
THE
RAT
HAD
TO
BREATH
WAS
CONSIDERABLY
SMALLER
THAN
WHAT
A
HUMAN
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BREATH
SO
MAYBE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
RAT
BUT
NOT
A
HUMAN
