what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
their
distribution
is
very
isotropic
and
the
intensity
distribution
crudely
speaking
indicates
were
seeing
an
edge
to
the
distribution
how
can
you
tell
the
difference
between
an
intensity
distribution
which
is
due
to
an
edge
in
the
spatial
distribution
and
an
intensity
distribution
which
is
due
an
a
sharp
dropoff
of
intrinsic
luminosities
below
a
certain
threshold
could
you
describe
roughly
what
the
intensity
distribution
is
like
