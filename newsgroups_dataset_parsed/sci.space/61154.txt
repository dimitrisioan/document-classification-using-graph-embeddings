PLUTOS
ATMOSPHERE
WILL
START
TO
FREEZE
OUT
AROUND
AND
AFTER
ABOUT
INCREASING
AREAS
OF
BOTH
PLUTO
AND
CHARON
WILL
BE
IN
PERMANENT
SHADOW
THAT
WILL
MAKE
IMAGING
AND
GEOCHEMICAL
MAPPING
IMPOSSIBLE
ITS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
FREEZING
WILL
START
TO
OCCUR
BECAUSE
OF
THE
GROWING

OF
PLUTO
AND

TO
ITS
ELLIPTICAL
ORBIT

IS
NOT
DUE
TO
SHADOWING
EFFECTS
WHERE
DOES
THE
SHADOW
COME
FROM
THERES
NOTHING
CLOSE
ENOUGH

BLOCK
SUNLIGHT
FROM

WOULDNT
EXPECT
THERE
TO
BE

BLOCK

OF
