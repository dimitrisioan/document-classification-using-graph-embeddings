everyone
who
sees
this
post
a
reply
that
says
hey
i
read
scispace
then
we
can
count
them
and
find
out
how
many
there
are
this
will
also
help
answer
that
nagging
question
just
what
is
the
maximum
bandwidth
of
the
internet
anyways
dont
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
email
back
to
you
that
we
read
scispace
so
that
you
can
count
them
and
every
server
in
the
world
does
not
have
to
get
bwd
to
death
or
instead
you
could
possible
cut
and
past
all
the
senders
into
a
single
post
and
save
on
header
bandwidth
not
meaning
to
be
taken
as
a
flame
its
late
and
we
have
to
work
toward
a
demo
little
punchy
jftm
