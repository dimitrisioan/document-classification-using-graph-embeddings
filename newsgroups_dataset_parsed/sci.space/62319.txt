GARY
COFFMAN
WRITES
AS
A
ROUGH
GUESS
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
IN
YEARS
SHUTTLE
HAS
DELIVERED
TO
LEO
ABOUT
AS
MUCH
AS
SATURN
V
DID
IN
YEARS
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFUL
TO
DEFINE
WHAT
IS
PAYLOAD
AND
WHAT
IS
PROPULSION
AND
SPACECRAFT
STRUCTURE
OFTEN
SHUTTLE
LIFTS
SATELLITES
WITH
UPPER
STAGES
YET
WE
STILL
CONSIDER
IT
PAYLOAD
TEN
SATURN
FLIGHTS
OVER
ABOUT
YEARS
DELIVERED
TO
LEO
ROUGHLY
THE
SAME
AS
SHUTTLE
FLIGHTS
OVER
YEARS
OF
COURSE
SATURN
LIFTED
MORE
THAN
SHUTTLE
BUT
ITS

TO
ORBIT
IN
SAME
YEAR

WAS
HIGHER
THEY
WHERE
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
IN
TERMS
OF
COSTPOUND
A
RESURECTED
SATURN
WOULD
COST
ONLY
PER
POUND
IF
DEVELOPMENT
COSTS
ARE
IGNORED
WHICH
IS
FIVE
TIMES
CHEAPER
THAN
SHUTTLE
