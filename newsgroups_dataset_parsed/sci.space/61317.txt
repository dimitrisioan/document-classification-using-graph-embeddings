space
race

base
on
the
cheap
although
the
billion
scheme
is
a
fantasy
its
an
old
canard
in
the
space
business
called
trolling
for
billionaires
there
is
a
good
chance
that
a
much
smaller
program
million
will
pass
the
congress
this
is
the
back
to
the
moon
bill
put
together
by
the
people
who
passed
the
launch
services
purchase
act
the
bill
would
incent
private
companies
to
develop
lunar
orbiters
with
vendors
selected
on
the
basis
of
competitive
bidding
there
is
an
aggregate
cap
on
the
bids
of
million
having
a
single
rich
individual
paying
billions
for
lunar
missions
is
probably
worse
than
having
the
government
bankroll
a
million
program
as
the
delta
clipper
program
has
shown
dcx
was
funded
by
sdio
at
million
we
have
a
clear
chance
of
making
a
lunar
mission
happen
in
this
decade
as
opposed
to
simply
wishing
for
our
dreams
to
come
true
please
support
the
back
to
the
moon
bill
