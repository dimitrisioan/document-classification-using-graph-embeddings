SOME
HOWEVER
SDIO
IS
NOT
I
REPEAT
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
FUND
AN
ORBITAL
PROTOTYPE
THE
BEST
WE
CAN
HOPE
FROM
THEM
IS
TO
KEEP
IT
ALIVE
FOR
ANOTHER
YEAR
AND
FUND
A
SUBORBITAL
VEHICLE
WHICH
MIGHT
WITH
MAJOR
MODIFICATIONS
JUST
MAKE
ORBIT
THERE
IS
ALSO
SOME
MONEY
FOR
A
SET
OF
PROTOTYPE
TANKS
AND

BE
THE
BASTARD
SON
OF
NLS
AND
JUST
AS
A
REMINDER
NOW
NOT
ALL
OF
THIS
MONEY
WILL
GO
TO
DC
BUT
A
GOOD
CASE
COULD
BE
MADE
FOR
SPENDING
HALF
ON
DC
PUBLIC
SUPPORT
IS
STILL
CRITICAL
MEET

YOUR
