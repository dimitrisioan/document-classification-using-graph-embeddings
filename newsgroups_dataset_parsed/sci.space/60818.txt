as
for
the
future
there
is
at
least
in
next
years
budget
for
work
on
ssrt
they
sdio
have
been
looking
for
more
funds
and
do
seem
to
have
some
however
sdio
is
not
i
repeat
is
not
going
to
fund
an
orbital
prototype
the
best
we
can
hope
from
them
is
to
keep
it
alive
for
another
year
and
fund
a
suborbital
vehicle
which
might
with
major
modifications
just
make
orbit
there
is
also
some
money
for
a
set
of
prototype
tanks
and
projects
to
answer
a
few
more
open
questions
would
the
suborbital
version
be
suitable
asis
or
aswillbe
for
use
as
a
reuseable
sounding
rocket
better
news
comes
from
the
new
spacelifter
effort
the
usaf
managers
of
this
program
are
very
open
to
ssto
and
will
have
about
next
year
for
studies
this
would
be
enough
to
bring
dcy
to
pdr
thank
ghod
i
had
thought
that
spacelifter
would
definitely
be
the
bastard
son
of
nls
and
just
as
a
reminder
now
not
all
of
this
money
will
go
to
dc
but
a
good
case
could
be
made
for
spending
half
on
dc
public
support
is
still
critical
meet
with
your
congressperson
ill
help
you
do
it
and
get
hisher
support
also
call
your
local
media
and
get
them
to
cover
the
flight
tests
