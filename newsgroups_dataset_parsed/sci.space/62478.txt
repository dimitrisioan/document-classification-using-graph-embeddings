JIM
HART
WRITES
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
A
STRONG
CLAIM
TO
CONTROL
OF
THE
THE
NIGHT
SKY
IT
IS
ASTRONOMERS
CHECK
OUT
THE
COMMON
LAW
IN
THE
DAYS
WHEN
WILD
LANDS
WERENT
SCARCE
PIONEERS
LAID
CLAIM
TO
THE
LAND
BY
PUTTING
IT
TO
USE
EG
CLEARING
AND
GROWING
A
CROP
EVEN
TRESPASSERS
CAN
LAY
CLAIM
TO
THE
RIGHT
OF
PASSAGE
IF
IF
THEYVE
DONE
IT
FOR
LONG
ENOUGH
AND
THE
OWNERS
HAVE
NOT
COMPLAINED
OR
TAKEN
STEPS
TO
STOP
THEM
USAGE
BEGETS
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
ASTRONOMERS
HAVE
BEEN
USING
THE
NIGHT
SKY
FOR
THOUSANDS
OF
YEARS
THEY
OWN
IT
EG
LIGHT
POLLUTERS
THEY
WILL
LOSE
THEIR
COMMONLAW
RIGHT
OF
OWNERSHIP
ANOTHER
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THEIR
OWNERSHIP
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
FREE
TO
SELL
IT
NOW
ASTRONOMERS
NEED
MONEY
FOR
THEIR
WORK
IF
LIGHT
POLLUTING
BILLBOARDS
AND
MIRRORS
GO
UP
THEY
WILL
NEED
EVEN
MORE
MONEY
TO
BUY
EXTRA
IMAGE
PROCESSING
EQUIPMENT
FILTERS
SPACE
TELESCOPES
ETC
TO
GET
AROUND
THE
PROBLEM
SO
AS
LONG
AS
WE
CAN
DEFINE
WHO
ASTRONOMERS
ARE
EG
DO
THEY
INCLUDE
AMATEUR
ASTRONOMERS
NATURE
LOVERS
WE
CAN
SET
UP
A
SYSTEM
OF
VOLUNTARY
CONSENSUS
TO
SOLVE
THIS
DISPUTE
INSTEAD
INVOKING
BANS
REGULATIONS
ETC
ENFORCED
BY
BRIBED
POLITICIANS
AT
THE
POINT
OF
A
GUN
WHY
DO
FOLKS
ALWAYS
THINK
OF
THAT
SORDID
SOLUTION
WE
OUGHT
TO
PASS
A
LAW
TO
SOLVE
PROBLEMS
FIRST
INSTEAD
OF
AS
A
LAST
RESORT
WHEN
OTHER
METHODS
HAVE
FAILED
STUFF
DELETED
THIS
PROPOSAL
CERTAINLY
NEEDS
WORK
BUT
HOW
ABOUT
WORKING
ON
THESE
KIND
OF
IDEAS
FIRST
BEFORE
WRITING
THERE
OUGHT
TO
BE
A
LAW
LETTERS
TO
OUR
CONGRESSCRITTERS
LETS
GIVE
NONCOERCIVE
CONSENSUS
VIA
THE
FREE
MARKET
A
CHANCE
TO
SOLVE
THIS
PROBLEM
JIM
HART
JHARTAGORARAINCOM
WOULD
MR
HART
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
HOW
ONE
COULD
GET
EVERY
NATION
ON
EARTH
AND
EVERY
CORPORATION
TO
AGREE
THAT
ASTRONOMERS
OWN
THE
NIGHT
SKY
WITHOUT
COERCION
REMEMBER
THAT
NOT
EVERY
NATION
FOLLOWS
THE
ENGLISH
COMMON
LAW
IN
MOST
COUNTRIES
FOR
MOST
OF
HISTORY
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
TRUE
THAT
THE
RULERS
OWNED
EVERYTHING
NOT
EXPLICITLY
OWNED
BY
INDIVIDUALS
EVEN
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
WHERE
BY
THE
PRINCIPLE
ENUNCIATED
THE
ABORIGINAL
INHABITANTS
SHOULD
HAVE
OWNED
EVERYTHING
WHEN
NEW
ARRIVALS
WANTED
TO
USE
LAND
AND
RESOURCES
THEY
JUST
TOOK
IT
OVER
IN
CASE
MR
HART
HASNT
NOTICED
THERE
IS
CURRENTLY
A
BRUTAL
WAR
GOING
ON
IN
BOSNIA
ABOUT
WHO
OWNS
WHAT
OF
COURSE
IF
SOME
FRIENDLY
SUPER
POWER
WERE
TO
GIVE
AN
INTERNATIONAL
ASTRONOMY
ORGANIZATION
SOME
ANTISATELITE
MISSILES
AND
ALSO
AGREE
TO
DEFEND
IT
IF
ATTACKED
SUCH
A
PROPOSAL
MIGHT
WORK
BUT
IT
WOULD
HARDLY
BE
NONCOERCIVE
SOME
OF
US
NUTTY
ENVIRONMENTALISTS
THINK
IT
MIGHT
MAKE
SENSE
FIRST
TO
TRY
TO
MOBILIZE
PUBLIC
OPINION
AGAINST
ADVERTISING
IN
SPACE
AND
ALSO
TO
USE
GOVERNMENTAL
ACTIONS
LIKE
TAXING
POWER
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
DISCOURAGE
THEM
THIS
OF
COURSE
WOULD
BE
TOO
COERCIVE
