thats

i
have
mb
worth
uuencoded
gif
images
contain
charts
outlining
one
of
the
many
alternative
space

designs
being
considered

me
again
wrote
i
just
posted
the
gif
files
out
for
anonymous
ftp
on
server
icsuciedu
you
can
retrieve
them
from
icsucieduincominggeodeagif
icsucieduincominggeodebgif
the
last
two
are
scanned
color
photos
the
others
are
scanned
briefing
charts
these
will
be
deleted
by
the
icsuciedu
system
manager
in
a
few
days
so
nows
the
time
to
grab
them
if
youre
interested
sorry
it
took
me
so
long
to
get
these
out
but
i
was
trying
for
the
ames
server
but
its
out
of
space
but
now
i
need
to
clarify
the
situation
the
incoming
directory
on
icsuciedu
does
not
allow
you
to
do
an
ls
command
the
files
are
there
i
just
checked
on
at
cdt
and
you
can
get
them
dont
forget
the
binary
mode
but
you
cant
ls
in
the
incoming
directory
a
further
update
marks
design
made
the
cover
of
space
news
this
week
as
one
of
the
design
alternatives
which
was
rejected
but
hes
still
in
there
plugging
i
wish
him
luck
using
ets
as
the
basis
of
a
space
station
has
been
a
good
idea
for
a
long
time
may
the
best
design
win

good
ideas
are
not
adopted
automatically
they
must
be
driven
into
practice
with
courageous
impatience
