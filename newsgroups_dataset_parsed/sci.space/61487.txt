MCCALL
WRITES
IN
GEORGE
F
KRUMINS
WRITES
I
WAS
SUGGESTING
THAT
THE
MINORITY
OF
PROFESSIONAL
AND
AMATEUR
ASTRONOMERS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
A
DARK
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
AND
FROM
WHENCE
DOES
THIS
RIGHT
STEM
THAT
IT
OVERRIDES
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THE
REST
OF
US
LET
ME
GET
THIS
RIGHT
SORRY
TRY
AGAIN
LET
ME
GET
THIS
STRAIGHT
WELL
MAYBE
THAT
TOO
IS
A
POOR
CHOICE
OF
WORDS
SOMEONE
MIGHT
THINK
IM
PUSHING
A
GAY
AGENDA
HOW
ABOUT
LET
ME
TRY
TO
UNDERSTAND
THIS
BY
REPHRASING
IT
AS
AN
EXTREME
I
AS
A
MINORITY
OF
ONE
HAVE
NO
RIGHT
TO
A
BEAUTIFUL
WORLD
YOU
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
MAKE
AN
UGLY
ONE
BECAUSE
YOU
PRESUME
TO
SPEAK
FOR
ALL
THE
REST
AND
I
CANNOT
COMPLAIN
CURIOUS
I
SAY
WHAT
IM
OBJECTING
TO
HERE
IS
A
FLOATING
BILLBOARD
THAT
PRESUMABLY
WOULD
MOVE
AROUND
IN
THE
SKY
I
FOR
ONE
AM
AGAINST
LEGISLATING
AT
ALL
I
JUST
WISH
THAT
PEOPLE
HAD
A
BIT
OF
COMMON
COURTESY
AND
WOULD
CONSIDER
HOW
THEIR
GREED
FOR
MONEY
IMPACTS
THE
MORE
ETHEREAL
AND
AESTHETIC
VALUES
THAT
MAKE
US
HUMAN
THIS
INCLUDES
THE
NEED
FOR
WILD
AND
UNSPOILED
THINGS
INCLUDING
THE
NIGHT
SKY
OH
I
SEE
YOU
DONT
WANT
ANY
LEGISLATION
THAT
MIGHT
IMPINGE
ON
YOU
YOU
JUST
WANT
EVERYONE
ELSE
ON
THE
PLANET
TO
DO
WHAT
YOU
WANT
AND
DO
YOU
WANT
EVERYONE
TO
DO
AS
YOU
WISH
INSIST
ON
PUTTING
SOMETHING
UP
THAT
WILL
IMPACT
EVERYONE
FOR
SELFISH
REASONS
WITHOUT
ANY
LEGISLATION
AND
NO
ONE
ELSE
CAN
EVEN
OBJECT
SOMEHOW
I
THINK
THIS
WHOLE
SHOVING
CONTEST
HAS
GOTTEN
WAY
OFF
THE
TRACK
IM
READY
TO
LET
THIS
THREAD
DIE
A
QUICK
AND
MERCIFUL
DEATH
INSISTING
ON
PERFECT
SAFETY
IS
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
HAVE
THE
BALLS
TO
LIVE
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD

DONT
SPEAK
