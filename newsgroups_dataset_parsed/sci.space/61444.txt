kept
my
grandfather
alive
from
until
i
dont
think
touting
contributions
is
a
good
idea
world
war
ii
produced
many
many
beneficial
spinoffs
eg
radar
jet
aeroplanes
rocket
technology
i
dont
think
anyone
would
argue
that
world
war
ii
was
in
and
of
itself
a
good
thing
if
you
want
people
to
back
the
space
program
it
must
be
a
good
thing
in
and
of
itself
i
disagree
with
what
to
tout
although
i
agree
that
the
space
program
is
inherently
a
good
thing
most
people
today
only
care
about
what
will
it
cost
me
and
whats
in
it
for
me
and
could
care
less
about
whether
something
is
simply
worthwhile
in
and
of
itself
our
society
has
become
increasingly
geared
toward
the
shortterm
which
you
could
read
as
now
they
couldnt
care
less
about
next
week
much
less
next
century
they
want
something
to
show
for
the
expenditure
and
they
want
it
now
i
think
to
some
extent
this
is
a
case
of
stooping
to
their
level
you
assume
that
the
general
public
cant
handle
the
truth
and
then
based
on
this
assumption
go
for
the
fluff
arguments
then
someone
who
can
understand
a
good
argument
comes
along
and
asks
why
dont
you
just
develop
the
spinoffs
or
why
cant
we
just
get
our
spinoffs
from
some
other
program
like
the
military
there
are
some
good
arguments
for
space
development
without
relying
on
its
side
effects
im
not
ignoring
the
value
of
spinoffs
i
simply
think
that
the
general
public
deserves
more
credit
than
you
give
them
btw
dont
forget
velcro
and
if
youre
going
to
use
spinoffs
you
better
make
darn
sure
you
are
right
teflon
has
been
around
since
before
nasa
as
i
understand
it
velcro
was
conceptualized
by
a
french
doctor
who
went
walking
in
the
woods
and
took
the
trouble
to
wonder
how
burrs
stick
to
your
clothes
certainly
velcro
was
available
on
hiking
equipment
by
the
early
to
mid
sixties
i
would
need
to
see
some
good
evidence
before
i
believe
that
either
of
these
would
not
be
here
today
without
nasa
josh
hopkins
find
a
way
or
make
one
attributed
to
hannibal
