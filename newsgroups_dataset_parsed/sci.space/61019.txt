HENRY
SPENCER
WRITES
THIS
PRIZE
ISNT
BIG
ENOUGH
TO
WARRENT
DEVELOPING
A
SSTO
BUT
IT
IS
ENOUGH
TO
DO
IT
IF
THE
VEHICLE
EXISTS
ACTUALLY
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
WILL
TELL
YOU
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
ENOUGH
TO
DO
SSTO
DEVELOPMENT
IF
DONE
PRIVATELY
AS
A
CUTRATE
OPERATION
OF
COURSE
THEY
MAY
BE
OVEROPTIMISTIC
IN
SPITE
OF
MY
GREAT
RESPECT
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
YOU
SPEAK
OF
I
THINK
THEIR
COST
ESTIMATES
ARE
A
BIT
OVEROPTIMISTIC
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
A
WORKING
SSTO
IS
AT
LEAST
AS
COMPLEX
AS
A
LARGE
AIRLINER
AND
HAS
A
SMALLER
EXPERIENCE
BASE
IT
THEREFORE
SEEMS
THAT
SSTO
DEVELOPMENT
SHOULD
COST
AT
LEAST
AS
MUCH
AS
A
TYPICAL
AIRLINER
DEVELOPMENT
THAT
PUTS
IT
IN
THE
TO
RANGE
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
A
CONTEST
ID
BET
SOME
THINGS
COULD
BE
CUT
LIKE
FUEL
FOR
REENTRY
ANY
KIND
OF
HEAT
SHIELDING
ETC
ETC
EVEN
STILL
IF
THE
CONTEST
PARTICIPANTS
HAD
TO
FUND
DEVELOPMENT
IT
PROBABLY
WOULDNT
BE
WORTH
IT
TO
DEVELOP
JUST
FOR
THE
CONTEST
JUST
GIVE
ME
THE
CHEAPEST
HEAVIEST
LIFT
MAN
RATED
OR
AT
LEAST
UNDER
OR
SO
GS
BOOSTER
IF
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
DEVELOPMENT
GREAT
ILL
USE
IT
BUT
BACK
TO
THE
CONTEST
GOALS
THERE
WAS
A
RECENT
ARTICLE
IN
AWST
ABOUT
A
LOW
COST
ITS
ALL
RELATIVE
MANNED
RETURN
TO
THE
MOON
A
GENERAL
DYNAMICS
SCHEME
INVOLVING
A
TITAN
IV
SHUTTLE
TO
LIFT
A
CENTAUR
UPPER
STAGE
LEV
AND
CREW
CAPSULE
THE
MISSION
CONSISTS
OF
DELIVERING
TWO
UNMANNED
PAYLOADS
TO
THE
LUNAR
SURFACE
FOLLOWED
BY
A
MANNED
MISSION
TOTAL
COST
US
WAS
BILLION
JOINT
ESANASA
PROJECT
WAS
BILLION
FOR
THE
US
SHARE
I
DIDNT
FIND
A
MENTION
OF
HOW
LONG
THE
CREW
COULD
STAY
BUT
ID
BET
THAT
ITS
AROUND
DAYS
AND
THE
TOTAL
PAYLOAD
DELIVERED
WAS
ABOUT
METRIC
TONNES
SO
IF
YOU
IGNORE
THE
SCIENTIFIC
PAYLOAD
HITCH
A
RIDE
IN
THE
CREW
HABITATION
MODULE
NO
RETURN
TRIP
AND
TOSS
IN
A
FEW
MORE
TONNES
FOR
THE
ADDITIONAL
CONSUMABLES
TO
LAST
ANOTHER
MONTHS
THEN
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
A
YEAR
VISIT
OUT
OF
TONNES
AND
IN
CASE
ITS
NOT
OBVIOUS
THATS
A
WILD
ASS
GUESS
A
PRETTY
BORING
VISIT
SINCE
EVERY
TRIP
OUTDOORS
EATS
UP
A
BIT
OF
LOX
AND
IM
NOT
CERTAIN
IF
A
HOME
BREWED
OR
COLLEGEBREWED
LIFE
SUPPORT
SYSTEM
COULD
LAST
A
YEAR
BUT
LETS
ROUND
THIS
UP
TO
TONNES
CONVIENT
SINCE
THE
GD
PLAN
TALKS
ABOUT
TON
PAYLOADS
DELIVERED
TO
THE
LUNAR
SURFACE
THIS
ADDS
UP
TO
TWO
CENTAURS
TWO
LEVS
TWO
SHUTTLE
FLIGHTS
ALL
TO
PUT
A
SINGLE
MAN
ON
THE
MOON
FOR
A
YEAR
HMMM
NOT
REALLY
PRACTICAL
ANYONE
GOT
A
CHEAPERBETTER
WAY
OF
DELIVERING
TONNES
TO
THE
LUNAR
SURFACE
WITHIN
THE
DECADE
ANYONE
HAVE
A
MORE
PRECISE
GUESS
ABOUT
HOW
MUCH
A
YEARS
SUPPLY
OF
CONSUMABLES
AND
EQUIPMENT
WOULD
WEIGH
AND
I
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
THE
GD
LEV
IS
IT
REUSABLE
OR
IS
IT
DISCARDED
TO
BURN
UP
ON
RETURN
TO
LEO
IF
ITS
NOT
DISCARDED
COULD
IT
BE
REFUELED
HENRY
DO
YOU
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
GD
LEV
I
NOTED
THAT
IT
USES
ENGINES
ARENT
THEY
REUSABLERESTARTABLE
WOULD
A
LEV
FIT
IN
A
IVE
FORGOTTEN
IF
I
EVER
KNEW
WHAT
THE
CARGO
BAY
DIMENSIONS
ARE
FOR
THE
ALL
IN
ALL
IM
NOT
CERTAIN
THAT
THE
SINGLE
GOALPRIZE
OF
STAYING
ON
THE
MOON
FOR
A
YEAR
IS
WISE
ANDOR
USEFUL
HOW
ABOUT
A
PRIZE
FOR
THE
FIRST
NONGOVERNMENT
SPONSERED
UNMANNED
MOON
LANDING
THEN
ANOTHER
FOR
A
MANNED
MOON
LANDING
THEN
YET
ANOTHER
FOR
A
SYSTEM
TO
EXTRACT
CONSUMABLES
FROM
LUNAR
SOIL
ANOTHER
FOR
A
REUSABLE
EARTHMOON
SHUTTLE
AND
SO
FORTH
FIND
SOME
WAY
TO
BUILD
CIVILIAN
MOONBASE
INFRASTRUCTURE
HAVING
A
SINGLE
GOAL
MIGHT
RESULT
IN
A
BUNCH
OF
CONTESTENTS
GIVING
UP
AFTER
ONE
PERSON
APPEARED
TO
WIN
AND
FOR
THOSE
THAT
DIDNT
GIVE
UP
I
FIND
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
SCARY
ABOUT
A
HALF
DOZEN
PEOPLE
HUDDLING
IN
RICKETY
LITTLE
MOON
SHELTERS
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
AS
MUCH
A
REWARD
FOR
COOPERATION
AS
FOR
COMPETITION
LASTLY
ABOUT
TEN
OR
FIFTEEN
YEARS
BACK
I
SEEM
TO
RECALL
THAT
THERE
WAS
AN
ENGLISH
SPACE
MAGAZINE
THAT
HAD
AN
ONGOING
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
MOONBASES
ON
THE
CHEAP
I
RECALLED
IT
DISCUSSED
THINGS
LIKE
HOW
MUCH
HEAT
THE
HUMAN
BODY
PRODUCED
HOW
MUCH
LUNAR
MATERIAL
ITD
NEED
FOR
PROTECTION
FROM
SOLAR
FLARES
ETC
UNFORTUNATELY
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE
NAME
OF
THIS
MAGAZINE
DOES
THIS
RING
A
BELL
TO
ANYONE
