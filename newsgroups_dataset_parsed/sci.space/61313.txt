WORDS
FROM
THE
CHAIRMAN
OF
BOEING
ON
SSTO
TYPE
STUFF
YESTERDAY
I
WENT
TO
THE
BOEING
SHAREHOLDERS
MEETING
IT
WAS
A
BIT
SHORTER
THAN
I
EXPECTED
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
THE
STOCK
WAS
FIRST
DOWN
THEY
MADE
A
BIG
PRESENTATION
ON
THE
AND
OTHER
PROGRAMS
THIS
YEAR
IT
WAS
MUCH
MORE
BAREBONES
IN
ANY
CASE
I
WANTED
TO
ASK
A
QUESTION
THAT
THE
BOARD
OF
DIRECTORS
WOULD
HEAR
AND
SO
I
GOT
THERE
EARLY
AND
FIGURED
THAT
IF
I
DIDNT
GET
TO
THE
MIKE
MAYBE
THEY
WOULD
READ
MINE
OFF
OF
A
CARD
AND
SO
I
WROTE
IT
DOWN
AND
HANDED
IT
IN
AFTER
THE
MEETING
STARTED
MR
SHRONTZ
SAID
THAT
HE
WOULD
ONLY
ANSWER
WRITTEN
QUESTIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
FAIR
TO
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
OVERFLOW
ROOM
THAT
ONLY
HAD
MONITORS
DOWNSTAIRS
NATURALLY
I
WAS
CRUSHED
SO
WHEN
QUESTION
AND
ANSWER
TIME
CAME
I
WAS
SUPRISED
TO
FIND
MY
QUESTION
BEING
READ
AND
ANSWERED
ADMITTEDLY
NEAR
THE
END
OF
THE
ONES
THAT
HE
TOOK
PRESUMABLY
GETTING
THERE
EARLY
AND
GETTING
THE
QUESTION
IN
EARLY
MADE
ALL
THE
DIFFERENCE
SO
ON
TO
THE
SUBSTANCE
THE
QUESTION
WAS
IS
BOEING
LOOKING
AT
ANYTHING
BEYOND
THE
HIGH
SPEED
CIVIL
TRANSPORT
SUCH
AS
A
COMMERCIAL
SPACE
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
AND
IF
NOT
HOW
WILL
BOEING
COMPETE
WITH
THE
REUSABLE
SINGLE
STAGE
TO
ORBIT
TECHNOLOGY
PRESENTLY
BEING
DEVELOPED
BY
MCDONNELL
DOUGLASS
WELL
HE
READ
IT
WITHOUT
A
HITCH
AND
WITHOUT
EDITING
WITH
IMPRESSED
ME
THEN
HE
ANSWERED
IT
VERY
QUICKLY
TREATING
IT
AS
A
TWO
PART
QUESTION
LAST
PART
FIRST
THIS
IS
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
RECOLLECTION
WHAT
HE
SAID
AS
FAR
AS
SINGLE
STAGE
TO
ORBIT
TECHNOLOGY
WE
THINK
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
BETTER
ANSWER
IN
A
TWO
STAGE
APPROACH
AND
WE
ARE
TALKING
TO
SOME
OF
OUR
CUSTOMERS
ABOUT
THAT
AS
FAR
AS
COMMERCIALIZATION
THAT
IS
A
LONG
WAYS
OFF
THE
HIGH
SPEED
CIVIL
TRANSPORT
IS
ABOUT
AS
FAR
OUT
AS
OUR
COMMERCIAL
PLANNING
GOES
AT
THIS
POINT
SO
THIS
TELLS
ME
THAT
BOEING
STILL
CONSIDERS
SPACE
TO
BE
A
NONCOMMERCIAL
ARENA
AND
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THIS
IS
TRUE
HOWEVER
IT
ALSO
TELLS
ME
THAT
THEY
CONSIDER
THERE
TO
BE
ENOUGH
MONEY
IN
BUILDING
SPACE
LAUNCHERS
FOR
THEM
TO
PERSUE
WORK
ON
THEIR
OWN
NOW
I
DO
HAVE
A
FRIEND
ON
THE
SPACELIFTER
PROGRAM
AT
BOEING
ACTUALLY
THIS
IS
A
MISNOMER
AS
THERE
IS
NO
SPACELIFTER
CONTRACT
FOR
THE
WORK
THAT
THIS
GUY
IS
DOING
HOWEVER
HE
IS
DOING
WORK
IN
PREPARATION
OF
A
PROPOSAL
FOR
SPACE
LIFTER
CONTRACTS
HE
WONT
TELL
ME
WHAT
HE
IS
DOING
BUT
MAYBE
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
TSTO
ACTION
IS
TAKING
PLACE
AT
BOEING
AT
THE
VERY
MINIMUM
THE
CHAIRMAN
OF
THE
BOARD
OF
BOEING
SAID
THAT
THEY
HAVE
AN
APPROACH
IN
MIND
AND
THEY
ARE
TRYING
TO
DO
SOMETHING
WITH
IT
ANYBODY
KNOW
ANYTHING
FURTHER
IS
THIS
REALLY
NEWS
DOES
THIS
THREATEN
FURTHER
WORK
ON
