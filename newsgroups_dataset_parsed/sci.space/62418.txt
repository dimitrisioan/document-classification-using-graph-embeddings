THE

OF
WHAT
PHILOSOPHER
WILL
BE
MOST
HIGHLY
REGARDED
IN
YEARS
IT
MAY
VERY
WELL
BE
AYN
RAND
WHO
IN
EVERY
IMPORTANT
RESPECT
WAS
AMERICAN
BUT
WAS
BORN
IN
RUSSIA

GUESS
THAT
REMAINS
TO
BE
SEEN
PLEASE
TAKE
THIS
OUT
OF
SCISPACE
AYN
RAND
WAS
NOT
ONLY
BORN
IN
RUSSIA
BUT
EDUCATED
THERE
A
LOT
OF
HER
PHILOSOPHY
REFLECTS
NOT
ONLY
A
EUROPEAN
EDUCATION
BUT
A
REACTION
AGAINST
CERTIAN
EVENTS
IN
RUSSIA
WHILE
SHE
LIVED
THERE
IVE

IS
A
DIVISION
OF
MODERN

BETWEEN
THE
CONTINENTAL

BRITISHAMERICAN

RAND
BELONGS
IN
THE

TERMS
OF

SHE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
THINGS
THAT
WOULD
BELONG
IN
THE
LATTER
SCHOOL
IE
SHE
WAS
TRAPPED
IN
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
KANT
AND
HEGEL
EVEN
THOUGH
SHE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
AT
TIMES
MUCH
DIFFERENT
THINGS
