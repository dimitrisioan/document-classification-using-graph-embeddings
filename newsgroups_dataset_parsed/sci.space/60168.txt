BLOW
UP
SPACE

EASY
WAY
TO
DO
IT
THIS
MIGHT
A
REAL
WIERD
IDEA
OR
MAYBE
NOT
I
HAVE
SEEN
WHERE
PEOPLE
HAVE
BLOWN
UP
BALLONS
THEN
SPRAYED
MATERIAL
INTO
THEM
THAT
THEN
DRYS
AND
MAKES
HARD
WALLS
WHY
NOT
DO
THE
SAME
THING
FOR
A
SPACE
STATION
FLY
UP
THE
DOCKING
RINGS
AND
BALOON
MATERIALS
AND
SUCH
BLOW
UP
THE
BALOONS
SPIN
THEN
AROUND
I
KNOW
A
PROBLEM
IN
MICRO
GRAVITY
LET
THEM
DRYCUREHARDEN
AND
CUT
A
HOLE
FOR
THE
DOCKINGATTACHING
RING
AND
BINGO
A
SPACE
STATION
OF
COURSE
THE
BALLONS
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
FOIL
COVERED
OR
SOMEOTHER
RADIATION
PROTECTIVE
COVERINGHEAT
SHIELD
AND
THE
MATERIAL
USED
TO
MAKE
THE
WALS
WOULD
HAVE
TO
MEET
THE
OUT
GASING
AND
OTHER
SPECS
OR
ATLEAST
THE
PAINTCOVERING
OF
THE
INNER
WALL
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
HUMAN
SAFE
MAYBE
A
SPECIAL
CONGRETE
OR
MAYBE
THE
SAME
MATERIAL
AS
MAKES
CAPLETS
BUT
WITH
SOME
CHANGES
SAW
WHERE
SOMEONE
INSTEA
DOF
WATER
PUT
BEER
IN
THE
CAPLET
MIXTURE
GOT
A
MIX
THAT
WAS
JUST
AS
STRONG
AS
CONGRET
BUT
EASIER
TO
CARRY
AROUND
AND
SUCH
SORRY
FOR
ANY
SPELLING
ERRORS
I
MISSED
SCHOOL
TODAY
GRIN
WHY
MUSTA
SPACE
STATION
BE
SO
DIFFICULT
WHY
MUST
WE
HAVE
GIRDERS
WHY
BE
CONFINED
TO
EARTH
BASED
IDEAS
LETS
THINK
NEW
IDEAS
AFTER
ALL
SPACE
IS
NOT
EARTH
WHY
BE
LIMITED
BY
EARTH
BASED
IDEAS
