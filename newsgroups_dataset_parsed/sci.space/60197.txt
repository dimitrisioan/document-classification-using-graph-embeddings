well
this
pretty
much
says
it
i
have
gotten
alot
of
replys
to
this
and
it
looks
like
oil
is
only
on
earth
so
if
those
greedy
little
oil
companys
who
obviously
dont
give
about
it
uses
up
all
the
oil
then
that
leaves
us
high
a
dry
greedy
little
oil
companies
dont
blame
them
oil
companies
just
supply
the
demand
created
by
you
me
and
just
about
everyone
else
on
the
planet
if
we
run
out
its
all
our
faults
he
also
ignores
a
few
other
things
while
organics
would
become
significantly
more
expensive
were
all
the
oil
to
disappear
and
thus
some
things
would
no
longer
be
economically
feasible
oil
is
hardly
an
irreplaceable
resource
any
more
than
most
other
consumables
as
supply
decreases
prices
rise
and
alternatives
become
more
competetive
he
also
needs
to
consider
that
there
has
been
an
estimated
years
of
reserves
pretty
much
as
long
as
anyone
has
cared
about
petroleum
whatever
the
current
usage
rate
is
we
always
seem
to
have
about
a
year
reserve
that
we
know
about
im
not
sure
that
last
figure
is
still
true
we
tend
not
to
look
as
hard
when
prices
are
comparatively
cheap
but
it
was
certainly
true
during
hte
oil
crisis
days
of
the
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
