THE
LIMIT
ON
SPACEWALKING
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
SUIT
SUPPLIES
MASS
AND
ORBITER
DURATION
IN
ORDER
TO
PERFORM
THE
REBOOST
OF
THE
HST
THE
OMS
ENGINES
WILL
BE
FIRED
FOR
A
LONG
PERIOD
NOW
THE
SHUTTLE
IS
A
HEAVY
THING
THE
HST
ISNT
LIGHT
EITHER
THE
AMOUNT
OF
OMS
FUEL
NEEDED
TO
FLY
BOTH
UP
IS
SUBSTANTIAL
A
SMALL
BOOSTER
CARRIED
UP
AND
USED
TO
BOOST
HST
ON
ITS
OWN
WILL
WEIGH
SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS
THEN
THE
OMS
FUEL
REQUIRED
TO
BOOST
BOTH
HST
AND
SHUTTLE
FOR
A
GIVEN
ORBITAL
CHANGE
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
MASS
MARGINS
ON
THE
HST
MISSIONS
ARE
TIGHT
ENOUGH
THEY
CANT
EVEN
CARRY
EXTRA
SUITS
OR
MMUS
PAT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANY
SPECIFICS
ON
THE
HST

BUT
I
CANT
SEE
WHY
THE

ARE
TIGHT
WHAT
ARE
THEY
CARRYING

AS

THIS
SHOULD
BE
LIGHTER
THAN
THE
ORIGINAL

DEPLOYMENT

WHICH
ACHIEVED
THE
HIGHEST
ALTITUDE
FOR
A

IS
NOW
IN
