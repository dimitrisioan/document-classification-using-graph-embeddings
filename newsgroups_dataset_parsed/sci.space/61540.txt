NO
THE
THING
IS
DESIGNED
TO
BE
RETRIEVABLE
IN
A
PINCH
INDEED
THIS
DICTATED
A
RATHER
ODD
DESIGN
FOR
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
SINCE
THEY
HAD
TO
BE
RETRACTABLE
AS
WELL
AS
EXTENDABLE
AND
MAY
THUS
HAVE
INDIRECTLY
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
ARRAYFLAPPING
PROBLEMS
WHY
NOT
DESIGN
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
TO
BE
DETACHABLE
IF
THE
SHUTTLE
IS
GOING
TO
RETUNR
THE
HST
WHAT
BOTHER
ARE
SOME
ARRAYS
JUST
FIT
THEM
WITH
A
QUICK
RELEASE
I
DIDNT
THINK
THE
BISTEM
DESIGN
WAS
USED
SO
MUCH
FOR
THE
RETRIEVAL
AS
FOR
THE
ABILITY
TO
LAUNCH
IN

THEYRE

HOWEVER
AS
