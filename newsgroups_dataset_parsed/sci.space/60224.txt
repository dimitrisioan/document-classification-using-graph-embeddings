RE
THE
AREA
RULE
I
AM
SURE
MARY
OR
HENRY
CAN
DESCRIBE
THIS
MORE
APTLY
THEN
ME
BUT
HERE
IS
HOW
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
AT
SPEED
NEAR
SUPERSONIC
THE
WIND
BEHAVES
LIKE
A
FLUID
PIPE
IT
BECOMES
INCOMPRESSIBLE
SO
WIND
HAS
TO
BEND
AWAY
FROM
THE
WING
EDGES
AS
THE
WING
THICKENS
THE
MORE
THE
PIPES
BEND
IF
THEY
HAVE
NO
PLACE
TO
GO
THEY
BEGIN
TO
STALL
AND
FORCE
COMPRESSION
STEALING
POWER
FROM
THE
VEHICLE
HIGH
DRAG
IF
YOU
SQUEEZE
THE
FUSELAGE
SO
THAT
THESE
PIPES
HAVE
APLACE
TO
BEND
INTO
THEN
DRAG
IS
REDUCED
ESSENTIALLY
TEH
CROSS
SECTIONAL
AREA
OF
THE
AIRCRAFT
SHOULF
REMAIN
CONSTANT
FOR
ALL
AREAS
OF
THE
FUSELAGE
THAT
IS
WHERE
THE
WINGS
ARE
SUBTRACT
TEH
CROSS
SECTIONAL
AREA
OF
THE
WINGS
FROM
THE
FUSELAGE
