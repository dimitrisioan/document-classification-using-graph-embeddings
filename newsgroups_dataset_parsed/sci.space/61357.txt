i
didnt
want
to
quote
all
the
stuff
thats
been
said
recently
i
just
wanted
to
add
a
point
then
enforces
those
rights
for
them
here
in
the
us
the
constitution
provides
a
bill
of
rights
from
which
most
if
not
all
legal
rights
are
considered
to
derive
im
sure
that
most
other
countries
have
these
seem
hardly
like
the
groups
to
discuss
this
in
but
huh
all
legitimate
power
to
enforce
these
rights
derives
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
not
from
no
steenkin
piece
of
paper
we
dont
disagree
on
this
all
i
said
was
that
a
right
is
whatever
you
or
somebody
acting
for
you
can
enforce
the
bill
of
rights
didnt
come
into
effect
until
it
was
ratified
by
the
states
and
indirectly
the
people
from
that
point
it
defined
legal
rights
common
law
rights
are
vague
and
situational
thats
why
the
people
insisted
on
a
bill
of
rights
in
the
constitution
spelling
out
exactly
what
they
demanded
from
the
government
legitimate
or
illegitimate
power
is
power
thats
why
the
federal
government
can
force
states
to
grant
their
citizens
rights
they
dont
wish
to
in
a
slugging
match
the
feds
win
period
and
youre
right
this
doesnt
belong
in
scispace
ive
said
my
peace
no
more
frome
me
on
rights
at
least
not
here
