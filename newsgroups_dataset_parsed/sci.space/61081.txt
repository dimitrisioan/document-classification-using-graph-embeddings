said
nsmca
so
some
of
my
ideas
are
a
bit
odd
off
the
wall
and
such
but
nsmca
so
was
wilbur
and
orville
wright
and
quite
a
few
others
this
is
a
common
misconception
there
was
nothing
off
the
wall
about
the
wright
brothers
they
were
in
correspondance
with
a
number
of
other
experimenters
octave
chanute
lillienthal
etc
they
flew
models
they
had
a
wind
tunnel
in
short
they
were
quite
mainstream
and
were
not
regarded
as
odd
or
eccentric
by
the
community
i
suggest
you
read
the
bishops
boys
or
the
biography
by
harry
gates
combs
i
can
never
remember
which
it
isthe
guy
that
had
the
fbos
and
owned
learjet
for
a
while
these
are
both
in
print
and
easily
obtainable
the
bishops
boys
is
in
trade
paperback
even
even
better
would
be
the
multivolume
set
of
the
wrights
writings
but
this
is
out
of
print
rare
and
hideously
expensive
