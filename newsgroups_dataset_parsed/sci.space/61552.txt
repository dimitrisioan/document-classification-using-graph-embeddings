ROBERT
BUNGE
WRITES
ITS
VANDALISM
BECAUSE
MANY
PEOPLE
POWER
COMPANIES

MALICIOUSLY
WASTE
LIGHT
MALICIOUSLY
IMPLIES
EVIL
INTENT
THE
LIGHTING
COMPANIES
ARENT
GOING
OUT
OF
THEIR
WAY
TO
SPOIL
THE
SKY
THEY
JUST
DONT
CARE
IF
THEY
CAN
SELL
YOU
OR
YOUR
CITY
OR
YOUR
STATE
AN
UNSHIELDED
LIGHT
THAT
WASTES
TO
PERCENT
OF
ITS
LIGHT
THEY
MAKE
MORE
MONEY
NEVER
MIND
THAT
YOUR
MONEY
IS
WASTED
IT
IS
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
THE
CUSTOMER
TO
CHOOSE
THE
MOST
EFFICIENT
HARDWARE
IF
THATS
WHAT
YOUR
CITY
WILL
BUY
THATS
WHAT
THE
LIGHTING
COMPANY
WILL
SELL
WRITE
A
LETTER
TO
CITY
HALL
THATS
FINE
IDEA
BUT
IT
ONLY
WORKS
IF
THE
LIGHTINGPOWER
COMPANY

BOTHERS
TO
SUPPLY
GOOD

FIXTURES
FOR
INSTANCE
A
POWER

RECENTLY
ASKED
A
STATE
COMMISSION
FOR
PERMISSION
TO
SELL
MORE
LIGHTS
OF
VARIOUS
TYPE
YET
ALL
OF
THE
DIFFERENT
FIXTURE
THAT
THEY
SOLD
AND
WANTED
TO
SELL
WERE
BAD
DESIGNS
ONE
THAT
WASTED
THE
LIGHT
THUS
YOU
COULDNT
EVEN
BUY
A
GOOD
LIGHT
FROM
THEM
IN
MOST
PLACES
TO
GET
A
GOOD
LIGHT
YOU
HAVE
TO
EITHER
ORDER
IT
SPECIAL
AT
HIGH
COST
OR
CALL
A
STORE
IN
ARIZONA
AT
SOME
POINT
SOCIETY
STARTS
TO
MAKE
RULES
CARS
HAVE
TO
PASS
SAFETY
TESTS
COMPANIES

MEET
POLLUTION
STANDARDS
ETC
THERE
ARE
TWO

I
WONT
RESPOND

ITS
IMPORTANT
FOR

SPACERS
OUT
THERE

REALIZE
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
OBJECT
TO
VARIOUS
WILD
IDEAS
THAT

PRESENTED
JUST
LIKE

IT
WOULD
BE
BEST
TO
CONSULT
