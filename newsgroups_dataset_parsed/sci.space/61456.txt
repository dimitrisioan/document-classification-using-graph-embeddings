PEOPLE
WHO
CRITICIZE
BIG
GOVERNMENT
AND
ITS
PROJECTS
RARELY
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
CONSISTENT
VIEW
OF
THE
ROLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
IN
SCIENCE
AND
TECHNOLOGY
BASICALLY
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
HAS
GOTTEN
INTO
THE
ROLE
OF
SUPPORTING
RESEARCH
WHICH
PRIVATE
INDUSTRY
FINDS
TOO
EXPENSIVE
OR
TOO
LONGTERM
HISTORICALLY
THIS
ROLE
FOR
THE
US
GOVT
WAS
FORCED
UPON
IT
BECAUSE
OF
SOCIALISM
IN
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
ORDER
FOR
US
INDUSTRIES
TO
COMPETE
WITH
GOVERNMENTSUBSIDIZED
FOREIGN
COMPETITORS
THE
US
GOVT
HAS
TAKEN
ON
THE
ROLE
OF
SUBISIZING
BIGTICKET
OR
LONGLEAD
RD
AS
A
REPUBLICAN
I
ABHOR
THE
NECESSITY
FOR
OUR
GOVERNMENT
TO
INVOLVE
ITSELF
IN
TECHNOLOGY
THIS
WAY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
MARKET
FORCES
SHOULD
DRIVE
TECHNOLOGY
AND
THE
WORLD
WOULD
BE
A
BETTER
PLACE
FOR
IT
BUT
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
WOULD
HAVE
TO
IMPLEMENT
THIS
CONCEPT
SIMULTANEOUSLY
OR
SOME
COUNTRIES
WOULD
HAVE
SUBSIDIZED
RD
WHILE
OTHERS
WOULD
NOT
SO
THE
US
MUST
SUBSIDIZE
BECAUSE
EVERYBODY
ELSE
DOES
THIS
SOUNDS
A
LOT
LIKE
THE
FARM
SUBSIDIES
ARGUMENTS
BEHIND
OUR
GATT
NEGOTIATIONS
DOESNT
IT
BUT
THIS
ROLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
SUBSIDIES
IS
ANTITHETICAL
TO
COSTEFFECTIVENESS
THE
GENERAL
IDEA
IS
TO
SPEND
MONEY
ON
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
AND
THEREBY
MAINTAIN
AND
PROMOTE
OUR
TECHNOLOGICAL
CULTURE
DESPITE
THE
FORCES
IN
THE

LIKE
THE
DREADED
QUARTERLY

REPORT
WHICH
ERODE
THE
ABILITY
OF
US
INDUSTRY
TO
INVEST
IN
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
AND
SINCE
OUR
GOAL
IS
TO
SPEND
MONEY
IT
MAKES
LITTLE
SENSE
TO
TRY
TO
SAVE
MONEY
OF
COURSE
WE
COULD
ALWAYS
SPEND
OUR
MONEY
MORE
WISELY
BUT
EVERYBODY
DISAGREES
ABOUT
THAT
THE
WISDOM
SHOULD
BE
ITS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
SOME
OF
OUR
BEST
TOOLS
FOR
COST
CONTROL
AVAILABLE
IN

TODAY
WERE
DERIVED
FROM

PROJECTS

AND
MOST
OF
THE
MODERN

COMES
FROM

AND
THEIR

THE

HAS
TAKEN
THESE
