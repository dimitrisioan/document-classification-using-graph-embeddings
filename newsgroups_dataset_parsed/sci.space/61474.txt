ata

writes
the
forever
war
one
of
my
favorite
scifi
books
had
a
passage
devoted
to
breathing
fluids
the
idea
was
to
protect
people
from
the
high
accelerations
required
for
interstellar
travel
by
emersing
the
passengers
in
drycleaning
fluid
saturated
with
oxygen
plenty
of
very
imaginative
ideas
is
this
book
i
would
certainly
recommend
it
won
the
hugo
and
the
nebula
awards
and
most
definitely
read
it
in
conjunction
with
heinleins
starship
trooper
the
two
books
are
radically
different
viewpoints
of
the
same
basic
premises
ive
even
heard
tell
of
english
classes
built
around
this
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
