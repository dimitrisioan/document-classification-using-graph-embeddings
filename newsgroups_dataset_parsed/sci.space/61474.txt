WAR
ONE
OF
MY
FAVORITE
SCIFI
BOOKS
HAD
A
PASSAGE
DEVOTED
TO
BREATHING

THE
IDEA
WAS
TO
PROTECT
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
HIGH
ACCELERATIONS
REQUIRED
FOR
INTERSTELLAR
TRAVEL
BY
EMERSING

IMAGINATIVE
IDEAS
IS
THIS
BOOK
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
RECOMMEND
IT
WON
THE
HUGO
AND
THE
NEBULA
AWARDS
AND
MOST
DEFINITELY
READ
IT
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
HEINLEINS

THE
TWO
BOOKS
ARE
RADICALLY
