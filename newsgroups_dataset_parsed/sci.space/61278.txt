RE
VANDALIZING
THE
SKY
IN
GEORGE
F
KRUMINS
WRITES
I
WAS
SUGGESTING
THAT
THE
MINORITY
OF
PROFESSIONAL
AND
AMATEUR
ASTRONOMERS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
A
DARK
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
SORRY
YOU
HAVE
A
WISH
FOR
AN
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
BUT
IT
ISNT
A
RIGHT
WHEN
YOU
GET
DOWN
TO
IT
YOU
ACTUALLY
HAVE
NO
RIGHTS
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
HAVENT
AGREED
TO
GIVE
YOU
AND
THEM
IN
THE
PROCESS
ITS
A
COMMON
MISCONCEPTION
THAT
BEING
BORN
SOMEHOW
ENDOWS
YOU
WITH
RIGHTS
TO
THIS
THAT
AND
THE
OTHER
SADLY
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
NOW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
THAT
SHOULD
GO
WITH
THE
POWER
TO
CLUTTER
THE
NIGHT
SKY
THEN
THATS
A
DIFFERENT
MATTER
