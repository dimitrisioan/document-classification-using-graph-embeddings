WRITES
HOW
HARD
OR
EASY
WOULD
IT
BE
TO
HAVE
A
COMBO
MISSION
SUCH
AS
A
SOLAR
SAIL
ON
THE
WAY
OUT
TO
THE
OUTER
PLANETS
BUT
ONCE
IN
NEAR
TO
ORBIT
TO
USE
MORE
NORMAL
MEANS
IF
YOUVE
GOT
A
GOOD
PROPULSION
SYSTEM
THATS
NOT
USEFUL
FOR
DECELERATION
SURE
YOU
CAN
USE
CHEMICAL
ROCKETS
FOR
THAT
PART
BUT
EVEN
JUST
DOING
THE
DECELERATION
CHEMICALLY
IS
A
MAJOR
HEADACHE

CRUISING
VELOCITIES
TAKING
THE
VELOCITY
DOWN
NEARLY
TO
ZERO
FOR
A
PLUTO
ORBIT
ISNT
EASY
WITH
CHEMICAL
FUELS
INCIDENTALLY
SOLAR
SAILS
ARE
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
SUITABLE
AS
THE
ACCELERATION
SYSTEM
FOR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
THEY
DONT
GO
ANYWHERE
QUICKLY
I
SPEAK
AS
HEAD
OF
MISSION
PLANNING
FOR
THE
CANADIAN
SOLAR
SAIL
PROJECT
ALTHOUGH
THAT
IS
MORE
OR
LESS
AN
HONORARY
TITLE
RIGHT
NOW
BECAUSE
CSSP
IS
DORMANT
THEY
CANT
FLY
A
MISSION
LIKE
THIS
UNLESS
YOU
START
TALKING
ABOUT
VERY
ADVANCED
SYSTEMS
THAT
DROP
IN
VERY
CLOSE
TO
THE
