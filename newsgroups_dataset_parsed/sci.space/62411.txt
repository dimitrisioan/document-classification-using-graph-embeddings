maybe
you
dont
mind
having
every
part
of
your
life
saturated
with
commercials
but
many
of
us
loathe
it
its
a
moot
point
step
out
of
your
door
go
anywhere
except
possibly
your
mailbox
you
will
be
subject
to
some
ad
agencys
poor

id
rather
not
have
the
beauty
of
the
night
sky
always
marred
by
a
giant
billboard
and
ill
bet
the
idea
is
virtually
sacrilegious
to
an
astronomer
like
sagan
while
im
sure
sagan
considers
it
sacrilegious
that
wouldnt
be
because
of
his
doubtfull
credibility
as
an
astronomer
modern
groundbased
visible
light
astronomy
what
these
proposed
orbiting
billboards
would
upset
is
already
a
dying
field
the
opacity
and
distortions
caused
by
the
atmosphere
itself
have
driven
most
of
the
field
to
use
radio
far
infrared
or
spacebased
telescopes
in
any
case
a
bright
point
of
light
passing
through
the
field
doesnt
ruin
observations
if
that
were
the
case
the
thousands
of
existing
satellites
would
have
already
done
so
satelliets
might
not
seem
so
bright
to
the
eyes
but
as
far
as
astronomy
is
concerned
they
are
extremely
bright
