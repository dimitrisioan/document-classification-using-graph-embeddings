because
of
his
doubtfull
credibility
as
an
astronomer
modern
groundbased
visible
light
astronomy
what
these
proposed
orbiting
billboards
would
upset
is
already
a
dying
field
the
ahh
perhaps
thats
why
weve
astronomers
have
just
built
groundbased
scopes
and
are
studying
designs
for
larger
ones
fc
exactly
what
fraction
of
current
research
is
done
on
the
big
fc
visable
light
telescopes
from
what
ive
seen
or
less
fc
down
from
amlost
years
ago
that
sounds
like
dying
fc
to
me
that
doesnt
seem
like
a
fair
comparison
infrared
astronomy
didnt
really
get
started
until
something
like
yrs
ago
it
didnt
explode
until
iras
in
gammaray
and
i
think
xray
observations
didnt
really
get
started
until
the
i
believe
the
same
is
true
of
ultraviolet
observations
in
general
and
i
know
that
extreme
uv
short
of
angstroms
observations
until
the
euve
launched
last
year
had
almost
no
history
except
a
few
observations
on
skylab
in
the
twentyfive
years
ago
the
vast
majority
of
astronomers
only
had
access
to
optical
or
radio
instruments
now
with
far
more
instruments
available
growth
in
some
of
these
new
fields
has
resulted
in
optical
work
representing
a
smaller
fraction
of
total
astronomical
work
seriously
though
youre
never
going
to
get
a
scope
into
orbit
as
cheaply
as
you
can
build
one
on
the
ground
and
with
adaptive
optics
and
a
good
site
the
difference
in
quality
is
narrowed
quite
a
bit
anyway
fc
that
would
be
true
if
adaptive
optics
worked
well
in
the
visable
fc
but
take
a
look
at
the
papers
on
the
subject
they
refer
to
anything
fc
up
to
microns
as
visable
i
dont
know
about
you
but
most
fc
people
have
trouble
seeing
beyond
microns
or
so
there
are
fc
reasons
to
think
adaptive
optics
will
not
work
at
shorter
fc
wavelengths
without
truely
radical
improvements
in
technology
hmm
some
of
the
folks
in
this
department
planning
on
using
adaptive
optics
at
the
m
at
palomar
for
nearinfrared
observations
and
microns
might
be
surprised
to
hear
this
and
isnt
the
ntt
already
pushing
toward
arcsecond
resolution
from
a
groundbased
