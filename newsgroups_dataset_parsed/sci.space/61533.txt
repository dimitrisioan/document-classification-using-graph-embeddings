the
material
was
useful
for
seals
but
it
had
a
major
problem
for
say
the
linings
of
vessels
it
wouldnt
stick
to
metal
what
the
space
program
did
was
to
find
a
way
to
get
it
to
stick
thus
we
had
nostick
frypans
on
the
market
in
the
late
ejon
matejevic
who
was
a
full
professor
at
clarkson
university
last
i
heard
developed
the
process
for
sticking
teflon
to
metals
i
dont
think
it
was
a
nasa
project
cuz
i
heard
he
held
the
patent
on
it
and
had
made
quite
a
bundle
off
it
anyone
from
clarkson
know
the
exact
story
i
never
wanted
to
ask
him
myself
