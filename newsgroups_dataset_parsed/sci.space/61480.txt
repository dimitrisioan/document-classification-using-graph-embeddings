tsto
was
words
from
chairman
of
boeing
gamesmaxuwashingtonedu
writes
re
response
from
cob
of
boeing
on
ssto
as
far
as
single
stage
to
orbit
technology
we
think
that
we
have
a
better
answer
in
a
two
stage
approach
and
we
are
talking
to
some
of
our
customers
about
that
as
far
as
commercialization
that
is
a
long
ways
off
anybody
know
anything
further
is
this
really
news
does
this
threaten
further
work
on
dc
boeing
has
been
looking
at
several
tsto
vehicles
and
has
carried
out
extensive
conceptual
studies
of
advanced
launch
systems
for
some
time
a
good
reference
on
this
might
be
comparison
of
propulsion
options
for
advanced
earthtoorbit
eto
applications
by
va
weldon
and
le
fink
from
boeing
the
paper
describes
a
propanefueled
tsto
launch
system
claimed
to
achieve
aircraftlike
operational
efficiencies
without
the
problems
associated
with
liquid
hydrogen
fuel
basically
its
a
highspeed
airplane
launching
a
hermestype
spaceplane
the
design
the
concept
is
also
called
beta
as
laid
out
in
the
paper
can
launch
at
least
pounds
into
polar
orbit
or
pounds
to
space
station
orbit
including
a
crew
of
eight
persons
and
life
support
system
design
reliability
is
beta
is
a
first
stage
powered
by
two
large
ramjets
and
high
speed
civil
transport
hsct
turbofans
a
long
reusable
orbiter
is
trapezemounted
in
the
belly
of
the
first
stage
aircraft
which
also
could
accommodate
a
longer
and
heavy
payload
on
an
expendable
second
stage
to
launch
the
orbital
vehicle
the
first
stage
takes
off
like
a
normal
hsct
and
accelerates
to
mach
at
that
point
the
turbofans
modified
to
burn
catalyzed
would
shut
off
and
the
ramjets
would
take
over
at
mach
the
orbiter
or
the
elv
would
swing
out
ignite
and
proceed
to
orbit
both
vehicles
would
land
like
aircraft
at
the
conclusion
of
their
respective
missions
estimated
total
weight
of
the
combined
configuration
at
takeoff
is
about
m
lbs
roughly
equivalanet
to
a
fully
loaded
the
orbiter
stages
weighs
about
including
klbs
of
lox
and
subcooled
propane
to
power
two
klbs
vacuum
thrust
rocket
engines
propellants
would
be
stored
at
degrees
kelvin
with
the
propane
in
a
spherical
tank
mounted
forward
of
the
cargo
bay
and
the
twoseat
orbiter
crew
station
lox
would
be
stored
aft
weldon
and
fink
claim
the
key
to
this
designs
success
is
the
structurally
efficient
airframe
and
the
compact
tankage
allowed
by
the
highdensity
supercooled
hydrocarbon
fuel
the
paper
compares
tsto
design
to
ssto
design
they
conclude
while
a
ssto
has
a
slightly
lower
recurring
cost
a
tsto
is
easier
cheaper
and
less
risky
to
develop
simpler
to
build
has
greater
safety
and
mission
versatility
and
doesnt
carry
the
hardtohandle
and
bulky
hydrogen
fuel
the
conlcude
in
conjunction
with
its
major
use
of
airplane
type
engines
and
fuel
as
well
as
its
inherent
self
ferry
capability
it
is
probably
the
system
most
likely
to
provide
as
close
to
airlinelike
operations
as
possible
with
a
practical
configuration
until
a
single
stage
airbreatherrocket
concept
can
be
shown
to
be
operationally
viable
is
this
really
news
does
this
threaten
further
work
on
dc
weldon
and
others
at
boeing
have
been
working
on
tsto
designs
for
some
time
i
expect
this
or
a
similar
concept
perhaps
the
hthl
ssto
they
proposed
for
the
sdio
ssto
first
phase
is
being
re
examined
as
a
basis
for
a
bid
on
the
first
phase
of
spacelifter
does
it
threaten
dc
possibly
there
is
a
set
of
ongoing
studies
trying
straighten
out
the
governments
future
space

strategy
mdc

boeing
as
well
as
other

are
providing

to
a
joint

team
back

there
are
various

the

of
the

isnt

how
