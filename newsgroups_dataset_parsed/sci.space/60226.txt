PAT
WRITES

ARTICLE
MCCALLMKSOLDSEGTICOM
FRED
J
MCCALL
WRITES
I
THINK
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
GREAT
WAY
TO
BUILD
IT
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
CURRENT
SPENDING
RULES
DONT
PERMIT
IT
TO
BE
WORKABLE
FOR
THIS
TO
WORK
IT
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
GUARANTEE
A
CERTAIN
MINIMUM
AMOUNT
OF
BUSINESS
IN
ORDER
TO
SUFFICIENTLY
REDUCE
THE
RISK
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
THIS
ATTRACTIVE
TO
A
PRIVATE
FIRM
SINCE
THEY
GENERALLY
CANT
ALLOCATE
MONEY
EXCEPT
ONE
YEAR
AT
A
TIME
THE
GOVERNMENT
CANT
PROVIDE
SUCH
A
TENANT
GUARANTEE
FRED
TRY
READING
A
BIT
THE
GOVERNMENT
DOES
LOTS
OF
MULTI
YEAR
CONTRACTS
WITH
PENALTY
FOR
CANCELLATION
CLAUSES
THEY
JUST
LIKE
TO
BE
DAMN
SURE
THEY
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
BEFORE
THEY
SIGN
A
MULTI
YEAR
CONTRACT
THE
REASON
THEY
ARENT
CUTTING
DEFENSE
SPENDING
AS
MUCH
AS
THEY
WOULD
LIKE
IS
THE
REAGAN
ADMINISTRATION
SIGNED
ENOUGH
MULTI
YEAR
CONTRACTS
THAT
ITS
NOW
CHEAPER
TO
JUST
FINISH
THEM
OUT
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
TRY
READING
A
BIT
PAT
I
WORK
AS
A
GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTOR
AND
KNOW
WHAT
THE
RULES
ARE
LIKE
YES
THEY
SIGN
SOME
DAMNED
FEW
WHICH
IS
WHY
EVERYONE
IS
ALWAYS
HAVING
TO
GO
TO
WASHINGTON
TO
SEE
ABOUT
NEXT
WEEKS
FUNDING
MULTIYEAR
CONTRACTS
THEY
ALSO
ARENT
WILLING
TO
INCLUDE
SUFFICIENT
CANCELLATION
PENALTIES
WHEN
THEY
DO
DECIDE
TO
CUT
THE
MULTIYEAR
CONTRACT
AND
NOT
PAY
ON
IT
WHICH
CAN
HAPPEN
ARBITRARILY
AT
ANY
TIME
NO
MATTER
WHAT
PREVIOUS
PLANS
WERE
TO
MAKE
THE
RISK
ACCEPTABLE
OF
SOMETHING
LIKE
PUTTING
UP
A
PRIVATE
SPACE
STATION
WITH
THE
GOVERNMENT
AS
THE
EXPECTED
PRIME
OCCUPANT
ID
LIKE
A
SOURCE
FOR
THAT
STATEMENT
ABOUT
THE
REASON
THEY
ARENT
CUTTING
DEFENSE
SPENDING
AS
MUCH
AS
THEY
WOULD
LIKE
I
JUST
DONT
BUY
IT
THE
OTHER
THING
I
FIND
A
BIT
FUNNY
ABOUT
YOUR
POSTING
PAT
IS
THAT
SEVERAL
OTHER
PEOPLE
ANSWERED
THE
QUESTION
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
WAY
I
DID
MINE
IS
THE
ONE
YOU
COMMENT
AND
INCORRECTLY
I
THINK
ON
I
THINK
THAT
SAYS
A
LOT
YOU
AND
TOMMY
SHOULD
MOVE
IN
TOGETHER
INSISTING
ON
PERFECT
SAFETY
IS
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
HAVE
THE
BALLS
TO
LIVE
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
