WRITES
SO
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
IT
COST
AS
A
PRIVATE
VENTURE
ASSUMING
YOU
COULD
TALK
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
INTO
LEASING
YOU
A
COUPLE
OF
PADS
IN
FLORIDA
WHY
MUST
IT
BE
A
US
GOVERNMENT
SPACE
LAUNCH
PAD
DIRECTLY
I
MEAN
IN
FACT
YOU
PROBABLY
WANT
TO
AVOID
US
GOVERNMENT
ANYTHING
FOR
SUCH
A
PROJECT
THE
PRICETAG
IS
INVARIABLY
TOO
HIGH
EITHER
IN
MONEY
OR
IN
HASSLES
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
TO
REALIZE
HERE
IS
THAT
THE
BIG
COST
OF
GETTING
TO
THE
MOON
IS
GETTING
INTO
LOW
EARTH
ORBIT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IS
PRACTICALLY
DOWN
IN
THE
NOISE
THE
ONLY
PART
OF
GETTING
TO
THE
MOON
THAT
POSES
ANY
NEW
PROBLEMS
BEYOND
WHAT
YOU
FACE
IN
LOW
ORBIT
IS
THE
LAST
THE
ACTUAL
LANDING
AND
THAT
IS
NOT
IMMENSELY
DIFFICULT
OF
COURSE
YOU
CAN
SPEND
SAGADOLLARS
SAGA
IS
THE
METRIC
PREFIX
FOR
BEELYUNS
AND
BEELYUNS
ON
THINGS
OTHER
THAN
THE
LAUNCHES
BUT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
THE
MAJOR
COMPONENT
OF
ANY
REALISTIC
PLAN
TO
GO
TO
THE
MOON
CHEAPLY
FOR
MORE
THAN
A
BRIEF
VISIT
AT
LEAST
IS
LOWCOST
TRANSPORT
TO
EARTH
ORBIT
FOR
WHAT
IT
COSTS
TO
LAUNCH
ONE
SHUTTLE
OR
TWO
TITAN
IVS
YOU
CAN
DEVELOP
A
NEW
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
THAT
WILL
BE
CONSIDERABLY
CHEAPER
DELTA
CLIPPER
MIGHT
BE
A
BIT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
THIS
PERHAPS
BUT
THERE
ARE
LESS
AMBITIOUS
WAYS
OF
BRINGING
COSTS
DOWN
QUITE
A
BIT
ANY
PLAN
FOR
DOING
SUSTAINED
LUNAR
EXPLORATION
USING
EXISTING
LAUNCH
SYSTEMS
IS
WASTING
MONEY
IN
A
BIG
WAY
GIVEN
THIS
QUESTIONS
LIKE
WHOSE
LAUNCH
FACILITIES
YOU
USE
ARE
NOT
A
MINOR
DETAIL
THEY
ARE
VERY
IMPORTANT
TO
THE
COST
OF
THE

WHICH
DOMINATES
THE
