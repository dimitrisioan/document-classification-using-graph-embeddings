actually
feels

for

is
there

of
falling

replied
yes
weightlessness
does
feel
like
falling
it
may
feel
strange
at
first
but
the
body
does
adjust
the
feeling
is
not
too
different
from
that
of
sky
diving
im
no
astronaut
but
ive
flown
in
the
several
times
ill
tell
you
about
my
first
flight
at
the
onset
of
weightlessness
my
shoulders
lifted
and
my
spine
straightened
i
felt
a
momentary
panic
and
my
hands
tried
to
grab
onto
something
like
the
strap
keeping
me
firmly
against
the
floor
to
prevent
me
from
falling
i
remember
conciously
overruling
my
involuntary
motions
my
ears
felt
not
heard
a
rush
and
i
could
feel
fluid
moving
in
my
head
like
when
you
get
up
from
bed
while
you
have
a
cold
at
that
point
i
ceased
to
concentrate
on
my
physiological
response
since
i
had
some
science
to
do
i
was
busy
keeping
my
experiment
going
and
keeping
track
of
all
the
parts
during
the
return
of
gravity
and
subsequent
pullout
so
i
didnt
really
pay
attention
to
physiology
at
that
time
after
about
parabolas
i
discovered
that
i
was
performing
one
of
the
tricks
ive
discovered
to
keep
myself
from
getting
motion
sickness
i
was
keeping
my
head
very
still
and
moving
very
slowly
all
except
my
hands
and
arms
which
needed
to
be
in
rapid
concious
motion
for
my
experiment
during
the
pullout
to
parabola
my
queasiness
finally
started
to
get
to
me
and
i
had
to
use
one
of
those
airsickness
bags
i
was
basically
useless
for
the
rest
of
that
flight
so
i
went
to
the
seats
in
the
back
of
the
plane
while
my
partner
whom
i
drafted
for
just
this
purpose
kept
working
on
the
experiment
while
i
was
ill
he
was
a
vetran
vomit
comet
rider
one
of
those
anomalous
people
who
dont
get
sick
on
the
thing
i
didnt
think
of
it
as
a
constant
sensation
of
falling
so
much
as
like
swimming
in
air
its
very
close
to
the
sensations
i
feel
when
im
scuba
diving
and
i
turn
my
head
down
and
fins
up
jerry
and
what
is
the
motion
sickness
that
some
astronauts
occasionally
experience
ron
it
is
the
bodys
reaction
to
a
strange
environment
it
appears
to
be
induced
partly
to
physical
discomfort
and
part
to
mental
distress
some
people
are
more
prone
to
it
than
others
like
some
people
are
more
prone
to
get
sick
on
a
roller
coaster
ride
than
others
the
mental
part
is
usually
induced
by
a
lack
of
clear
indication
of
which
way
is
up
or
down
ie
the
shuttle
is
normally
oriented
with
its
cargo
bay
pointed
towards
earth
so
the
earth
or
ground
is
above
the
head
of
the
astronauts
about
of
the
astronauts
experience
some
form
of
motion
sickness
and
nasa
has
done
numerous
tests
in
space
to
try
to
see
how
to
keep
the
number
of
occurances
down
im
a
volunteer
in
jscs
space
biomedical
laboratory
where
they
do
among
other
things
some
of
the
tests
ron
mentions
i
was
in
one
called
the
preflight
adaptation
trainer
which
consisted
of
a
chair
on
a
severaldegreeoffreedom
motion
base
with
moving
geometric
visual
aids
the
goal
was
to
measure
the
victimshhhhhhhh
subjects
responses
and
subjective
physiological
descriptions
and
see
if
repeated
exposure
to
this
environment
could
reduce
future
motion
sickness
symptoms
jerry
i
dont
know
of
any
former
or
activeduty
astronauts
who
personally
read
this
group
i
know
that
bruce

office
had
been
waiting
anxiously
for
the
space
station
redesign

i
posted

but
i
dont

bruce
reads

himself
