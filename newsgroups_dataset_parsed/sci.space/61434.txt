RE
HST
SERVICING
MISSION
SCHEDULED
FOR
DAYS
IN
ARTICLE
ZWORKSTARFIGHTERDENMMCCOM
MICHAEL
CORVIN
WRITES
REGARDING
THE
FEASABILITY
OF
RETRIEVING
THE
HST
FOR
REPAIR
AND
RELAUNCHING
IT
CAUTION
SPECULATION
MODE
ENGAGED
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
CONSIDERATION
THAT
HASNT
BEEN
MENTIONED
YET
I
EXPECT
THAT
RETRIEVING
HST
WOULD
INVOLVE
DAMAGING
IT
CONSIDERABLY
IN
ORDER
TO
RETURN
IT
TO
ITS
CRADLE
IN
THE
CARGO
BAY
MOST
OF
THE
DEPLOYED
ITEMS
ANTENNAS
AND
ESPECIALLY
THE
SOLAR
ARAYS
PROBABLY
ARE
NOT
RETRACTABLE
INTO
THEIR
FULLY
STOWED
POSITION
EVEN
BY
HAND
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
REMOVED
BY
THE
ASTRONAUTS
THE
ONLY
ADVANTAGE
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
YIELD
IS
THAT
WE
COULD
PUT
NEW
PANELS
ON
THAT
DONT
RING
DUE
TO
THERMAL
CYCLE
STRESSES
I
ALSO
EXPECT
THAT
AS
HAS
BEEN
DISCUSSED
THE
LANDING
LOADS
ON
THE
HST
OPTICS
STRUCTURE
IS
A
BIG
ISSUE
BUT
THAT
THE
REENTRY
LOADS
ARE
MUCH
LESS
SO
CAN
THE
MOVEABLE
OPTICAL
COMPONENTS
EVEN
BE
RECAGED
I
ASSUME
THAT
THEY
WERE
CAGED
FOR
LAUNCH
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
SOMEONE
HERE
FROM
THE
HST
PROGRAM
WAS
TALKING
INSTEAD
OF
ALL
THE
SPECULATION
THAT
IS
GOING
ON
HERE
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
FROM
DR
FRANK
SIX
OF
THE
MARSHALL
SPACE
FLIGHT
CENTER
THERE
IS
NO
INSRMOUNTABLE
PROBLEM
IN
BRINGING
HST
BACK
IT
WAS
DESIGNED
THAT
WAY
TO
BEGIN
WITH
ALSO
IT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
SOLAR
ARRAYS
WILL
BE
ONE
OF
THE
ITEMS
REPLACED
ON
THIS
MISSION
THE
ORIGINALS
WERE
BUILT
BY
BRIT
AEROSPACE
AND
I
THINK
THE
NEW
ONES
ARE
TOO
I
AM
CURRENTLY
WORKING
WITH
THE
GUYS
AT
MSFC
THAT
ARE
IN
CHARGE
IS
THE
HST
POWER
SYSTEM
ALTHOUGH
I
HAVE
NOT
SPOKEN
WITH
THEM
IN
A
LONG
TIME
ABOUT
HST
