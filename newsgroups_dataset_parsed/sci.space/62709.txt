WRITES
WHILE
IM
SURE
SAGAN
CONSIDERS
IT
SACRILEGIOUS
THAT
WOULDNT
BE
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
DOUBTFULL
CREDIBILITY
AS
AN
ASTRONOMER
MODERN
GROUNDBASED
VISIBLE
LIGHT
ASTRONOMY
WHAT
THESE
PROPOSED
ORBITING
BILLBOARDS
WOULD
UPSET
IS
ALREADY
A
DYING
FIELD
THE
OPACITY
AND
DISTORTIONS
CAUSED
BY
THE
ATMOSPHERE
ITSELF
HAVE
DRIVEN
MOST
OF
THE
FIELD
TO
USE
RADIO
FAR
INFRARED
OR
SPACEBASED
TELESCOPES
HARDLY
THE
KECK
TELESCOPE
IN
HAWAII
HAS
TAKEN
ITS
FIRST
PICTURES
THEYRE
NEARLY
AS
GOOD
AS
HUBBLE
FOR
A
TINY
FRACTION
OF
THE
COST
IN
ANY
CASE
A
BRIGHT
POINT
OF
LIGHT
PASSING
THROUGH
THE
FIELD
DOESNT
RUIN
OBSERVATIONS
IF
THAT
WERE
THE
CASE
THE
THOUSANDS
OF
EXISTING
SATELLITES
WOULD
HAVE
ALREADY
DONE
SO
SATELLIETS
MIGHT
NOT
SEEM
SO
BRIGHT
TO
THE
EYES
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
ASTRONOMY
IS
CONCERNED
THEY
ARE
EXTREMELY
BRIGHT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
ORBITING
SPACE
JUNK
WILL
BE
FAR
BRIGHTER
STILL
MORE
LIKE
THE
FULL
MOON
THE
MOON
UPSETS
DEEPSKY
OBSERVATION
ALL
OVER
THE
SKY
AND
NOT
JUST
LOOKING
AT
IT
BECAUSE
OF
SCATTERED
LIGHT
THIS
IS
A
KNOWN
PROBLEM
BUT
OF
COURSE
TWO
WEEKS
OUT
OF
EVERY
FOUR
ARE
OK
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
THIS
BILLBOARD
CIRCLES
EVERY
MINUTES
WHAT
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
TIME
