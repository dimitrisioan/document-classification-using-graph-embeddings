whats
new
in
my
opinion
friday
april
washington
dc
space
billboards
is
this
one
the
spinoffs
we
were
promised
in
science
fiction
writer
robert
heinlein
published
the
man
who
sold
the
moon
which
involved
a
dispute
over
the
sale
of
rights
to
the
moon
for
use
as
billboard
nasa
has
taken
the
firsteps
toward
this
hideous
vision
of
the
future
observers
were
startled
this
spring
when
a
nasa
launch
vehicle
arrived
at
the
pad
with
schwarzenegger
painted
in
huge
block
letters
on
the
side
of
the
booster
rockets
space
marketing
inc
had
arranged
for
the
ad
to
promote
arnolds
latest
movie
well
if
youre
going
to
get
upset
with
this
you
might
as
well
direct
some
of
this
moral
outrage
towards
glavcosmos
as
well
they
pioneered
this
capitalist
application
of
booster
adverts
long
before
nasa
in
fact
you
can
all
direct
your
ire
at
the
proper
target
by
ingoring
nasa
altogether
the
rocket
is
a
commercial
launch
vechicle
a
conestoga
flying
a
comet
payload
nasa
is
simply
the
primary
customer
i
believe
sdio
has
a
small
payload
as
well
the
advertising
space
was
sold
by
the
owners
of
the
rocket
who
can
do
whatever
they
darn
well
please
with
it
in
addition
these
anonymous
observers
had
no
reason
to
be
startled
the
deal
made
space
news
at
least
twice
now
space
marketing
is
working
with
university
of
colorado
and
livermore
engineers
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflatable
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
nasa
would
provide
contractual
launch
services
however
since
nasa
bases
its
charge
on
seriously
flawed
cost
estimates
wn
mar
the
taxpayers
would
bear
most
of
the
expense
is
nasa
really
supporting
this
junk
and
does
anyone
have
any
more
details
other
than
what
was
in
the
wn
news
blip
how
serious
is
this
project
is
this
just
in
the
wild
idea
stage
or
does
it
have
real
funding
i
think
its
only
fair
to
find
that
out
before
everyone
starts
having
a
hissy
fit
the
fact
that
they
bothered
to
use
the
conditional
tense
suggests
that
it
has
not
yet
been
approved
josh
hopkins
find
a
way
or
make
one
attributed
to
hannibal
