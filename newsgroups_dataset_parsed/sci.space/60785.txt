AS

ESTABLISHED
TO
CORRELATE

THE

THERE
ARE

THE

CONDUCTED
BY

AND
THE

RESEARCH
PROVIDES
COLLABORATIVE
GROUND
TRUTH
FOR
THOSE
ACTIVITIES
AS
WELL
AS
DATA
THAT
IS
USEFUL
IN
ITS
OWN
RIGHT
THE
MEASUREMENTS
TAKEN
BY
THE
BALLOON
PAYLOAD
WILL
ADD

WHEN

WE
ALSO
NEEDED
TO
FLY
IN

HOW

IT
WILL
BE
SEVERAL
