sez
given
that
ive
heard
the
shuttle
software
rated
as
level
in
maturity
i
strongly
doubt
that
this
having
lots
of
bugs
is
the
case
level
out
of
how
many
what
are
the
different
levels
ive
never
heard
of
this
rating
system
anyone
care
to
clue
me
in
this
is
a
rating
system
used
by
arpa
and
other
organisations
to
measure
the
maturity
of
a
software
process
ie
the
entire
process
by
which
software
gets
designed
written
tested
delivered
supported
etc
see

the
software
process

the
levels
of
software
process
maturity
are
initial
repeatable
defined
managed
optimizing
the
levels
are
approximately
characterized
as
follows
no
statistically
software
process
control
have
no
statistical
basis
for
estimating
how
large
software
will
be
how
long
it
will
take
to
produce
how
expensive
it
will
be
or
how
reliable
it
will
be
most
software
production
is
at
this
level
stable
process
with
statistical
controls
rigorous
project
management
having
done
something
once
can
do
it
again
projects
are
planned
in
detail
and
there
is
software
configuration
management
and
quality
assurance
the
process
is
defined
and
understood
implementation
is
consistent
this
includes
things
like
software
inspection
a
rigorous
software
testing
framework
more
configuration
management
and
typically
a
software
engineering
process
group
within
the
project
statistical
information
on
the
software
is
systematically
gathered
and
analysed
and
the
process
is
controlled
on
the
basis
of
this
information
software
quality
is
measured
and
has
goals
defects
are
prevented
the
process
is
automated
software
contracts
are
effective
and
certified
