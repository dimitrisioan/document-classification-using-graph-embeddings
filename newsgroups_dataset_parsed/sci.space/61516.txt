GETTING
WIERD
AGAIN
OKAY
WE
HAVE
FIGURE
OUT
THAT
A
MISSION
SPECIFICALLY
TO
PLUTO
IS
TO
LARGE
AND
TO
EXPENSIVE
OKAY
WHAT
ABOUT
LAUNCHING
ONE
PROBE
WITH
MULTIPLE
PARTS
KIND
OF
LIEK
THE
OLD
MIRV
PRINCIPLE
OF
OLD
COLD
WAR
DAYS
BASICALLY
WHAT
I
MEAN
IS
DESIGN
A
MOTHER
SHIP
THAT
HAS
PIGGY
BACKED
PROBES
FOR
DIFFERENT
MISSIONSNAMELY
DIFFERENT
PLANETS
EACH
PROBE
WOULD
BE
TIED
IN
WITH
THE
MOTHER
SHIP
OR
EARTH
AS
THE
CASE
MAY
BE
THIS
IS
GOOD
WHEN
AND
IF
WE
GO
FOR
MARS
THE
MARS
MISSION
CAN
ACT
AS
EITHER
MOTHER
SHIP
OR
RELAY
POINT
FOR
THE
PROBES
ALSO
THE
MOTHER
SHIP
WOULD
BE
POWERED
IF
NOT
THE
MARS
MISSION
BY
A
NORMAL
PROPULSION
BUT
ALSO
A
SOLAR
SAIL
MAIN
REASON
FOR
SOLAR
SAIL
RACE
IS
TO
SEE
WHAT
CAN
BE
DONE
AND
AUTMOATED
THE
SAIL
WOULD
GET
THE
PROBES
TO
WERE
THEY
NEEDED
I
KNOW
THE
ASTEROIDMETEOR
CLOUDS
AND
SUCH
MIGHT
GET
IN
THE
WAY
OF
A
SAIL
MAIN
REASONF
RO
MOTHER
SHIP
IDEA
IS
TO
MAKE
IT
MORE
ECONOMOICAL
TO
SEND
MULTIPLE
PROBESMISSIONSATELLITESEXPLORERES
TO
DIFFERENT
PLACES
AND
CUT
COSTS
THE
PROBES
COULD
