WRITES
I
WROTE
PRBACCESSDIGEXNET
PAT
WRITES
MY
DATA
SHOWS
THAT
THE
OMS
ENGINES
HOLD
KG
OF
PROPELLANT
OF
THAT
A
SUBSTANTIAL
FRACTION
IS
GOING
TO
BE
USED
FOR
THE
FIRST
OMS
BURN
THE
REENTRY
BURN
AND
THE
RESERVE
SO
PAT
TELL
US
HOW
MUCH
FUEL
THE
ALTITUDE
CHANGE
IS
GOING
TO
TAKE
AND
HOW
MUCH
THE
EDO
PALLET
AND
EXTRA
PARTS
ARE
GOING
MASS
IF
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THE
NUMBERS
WORK
OUT
THEN
ILL
BE
INTERESTED
AFTER
YOU
SHOW
US
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
DONE
THEN
TELL
US
HOW
MUCH
THE
EDO
PALLET
AND
EXTRA
EQUIPMENT
IS
GOING
TO
COST
I
DONT
KNOW
DOES
ANYONE
IN
NASA
LAND
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
FUEL
IS
BUDGETED
FOR
THE
ALTITUDE
CHANGE
HENRY
ANY
FIGURES
ON
THE
MASS
FULL
FOR
THE
EDO
PALLET
PLUS
ITS
DRY
WEIGHT
HOW
ABOUT
FOR
THE
DRY
MASS
OF
IT
WAS
BEING
DECLASSIFIED
AS
I
CHECKED
LAST
ALSO
I
NEED
CURRENT
ORBITAL
PARAMETERS
OF
HST
PROJECTED
ORBITAL
PARAMETERS
AFTER
REBOOST
DISCOVERYS
DRY
WEIGHT
HSTS
DRY
WEIGHT
I
SOMEHOW
THINK
THEY
COULD
TRAIN
UP
A
NEW
EVA
IN
MONTHS
FIRST
WHILE
ASTRONAUTS
CERTAINLY
HAVE
DONE
EVAS
WITH
MINIMAL
PLANNING
THAT
WAS
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
TO
THEY
DONT
LIKE
TO
DO
THAT
AS
A
GENERAL
RULE
SO
HOW
LONG
DO
THEY
NEED
TO
TRAIN
A
YEAR
YEARS
SOMEHOW
I
THINK
MOTHS
SHOULD
BE
ADEQUATE
SECOND
REMEMBER
WHY
THEY
HAD
TO
IMPROVISE
DURING
INTELSAT
THEY
WERE
TRYING
TO
ATTACH
A
MOTOR
TO
A
PIECE
OF
HARDWARE
THAT
WASNT
DESIGNED
TO
DO
THAT
TRYING
TO
SHORTCUT
THE
TRAINING
IS
ONLY
GOING
TO
MAKE
A
REPEAT
MORE
LIKELY
ALSO
BECAUSE
THEY
SIGNIFICANTLY
LACKED
ONORBIT
EVA
EXPERIENCE
THE
HST
IS
DESIGNED
FOR
ONORBIT
SERVICING
IT
SHOULD
BE
A
LOT
EASIER
THIRD
THEY
DONT
HAVE
EIGHT
MONTHS
THEY
HAVE
HOWEVER
MUCH
TIME
IS
LEFT
AFTER
SOMEONE
COMES
UP
WITH
A
PLAN
SHOWS
IT
CAN
WORK
AND
GETS
IT
APPROVED
YOU
MAY
THINK
I
HAVE
A
PESSIMISTIC
ATTITUDE
I
THINK
ITS
REALISTIC
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
THE
ENGINEERING
TASK
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FEW
ENGINEERING
TASKS
ARE
WHAT
IM
SAYING
IS
THAT
THIS
IS
NEITHER
COST
EFFECTIVE
NOR
FEASIBLE
UNDER
NASA
MANAGEMENT
THERE
COMES
A
TIME
IN
EVERY
PROJECT
TO
KILL
THE
MANAGEMENT
THEY
CAN
IF
NECCESSARY
RESCHEDULE
THE
HST
MISSION
DECEMBER
IS
NOT
A
DROP
DEAD
DATE
UNLIKE
SAY
THE
LDEF
RETRIEVAL
MISSION
ALL
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
SOUP
IT
UP
JUST
WHAT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
I
SUSPECT
THE
MAY
NOT
HAVE
ENOUGH
BASIC
THRUST
FOR
THE
HST
REBOOST
IT
MAYU
NEED
BIGGER
TANKS
OR
BIGGER
THRUSTERS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THE
SECOND
HST
SERVICING
MISSION
IS
NOT
A
CONTINGENCY
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THE
MISSION
NEEDS
BOTH
A
NEW
FOC
AND
WORK
ON
THE
ELECTRICAL
SYSTEM
PLUS
ANOTHER
REBOOST
IF
THE
SMT
CAN
AVOID
A
SECOND
SERVICING
MISSION
THATS
MILLION
SAVED
NO
PAT
THATS
MILLION
MINUS
THE
COST
OF
THE
NEW
HARDWARE
MINUS
THE
COST
OF
THE
EXTRA
STRUFF
YOU
WANT
TO
BRING
ALONG
MINUS
DEVELOPMENT
AND
MANGEMENT
COSTS
MINUS
EXTRA
OPERATING
COSTS
TANSTAAFL
SOMEHOW
I
THINK
THE
COST
OF
AN
EXPENDABLE
SMT
WILL
BE
LESS
THEN
MILLION
AND
THE
EXTRA
STUFF
IS
REAL
CHEAP
NASA
HAS
LOTS
OF
SUITS
MMUS
AND
THE
EDO
PALLETS
ARE
REUSABLE
OH
ONE
DOUBLE
MAGNUM
OF
CHAMPAGNE
NOW
THERES
A
COUPLE
HUNDRED
BUCKS
PAT
NOT
ONLY
IS
THIS
MESSY
AND
LESS
RELIABLE
THAN
A
DEVICE
THATS
MADE
TO
PERFORM
THIS
TASK
IT
ALSO
IGNORES
THE
POINT
THERE
IS
A
DESIRE
TO
HAVE
ASTRONAUTS
AVAILABLE
SO
THAT
IF
THE
DOOR
FAILS
TO
OPEN
SOMETHING
CAN
BE
DONE
ABOUT
IT
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
PROVIDE
A
VERY
RELIABLE
WAY
OF
REOPENING
THE
DOOR
YOU
HAVENT
SOLVED
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
DOOR
HAS
CYCLED
X
TIMES
ALREADY
ONCE
AFTER
MASSIVE
G
LOADING
I
SOMEHOW
THINK
THEY
CAN
WORK
OURELIABILITY
METHODS
TO
ENSURE
THE
DOOR
WORKS
ALSO
PLEASE
TELL
ME
HOW
SOME
SORT
OF
SUBLIMATED
MATERIAL
LIKE
OR
WOULD
MANAGE
TO
CONTAMINATE
THE
MIRROR
ANYTHING
THAT
GOES
TO
VAPOR
STATE
SHOULDNT
ADHERE
TO
THE
MIRROR
SOMEHOW
THE
DOOR
PROBLEM
CAN
BE
WORKED
MAYBE
THEY
CAN
PUT
A
ONE
TIME
SPRING
ON
IT
WHAT
DO
THEY
DO
NOW
IF
THE
DOOR
HANGS
UP
THAT
DOOR
IS
PART
OF
A
INTRUMENT
SAFING
MECHANISM
IF
IT
HANGS
UP
TOMORROW
ITLL
BE
MONTHS
UNTIL
SOMEONE
GETS
UP
THERE
WITHA
CROWBAR
TO
FIX
IT
PAT
