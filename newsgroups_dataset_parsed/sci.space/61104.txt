CRAIG
KEITHLEY
WRITES
AH
THERES
THE
RUB
AND
A
TO
BOOT
FOR
THE
PURPOSES
OF
A
CONTEST
YOULL
PROBABLY
NOT
COMPETE
IFN
YOU
CANT
AFFORD
THE
RIDE
TO
GET
THERE
AND
ALTHOUGH
LOWER
PRICED
DELIVERY
SYSTEMS
MIGHT
BE
DOABLE
WITHOUT
DEMAND
ITS
DOUBTFUL
THAT
ANYONE
WILL
DEVELOP
A
NEW
SYSTEM
YOURE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
LOWCOST
DELIVERY
SYSTEM
HAS
TO
BE
A
SEPARATE
PROJECT
BUT
WHY
IF
YOU
ARE
SPENDING
HUNDREDS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
IN
HOPES
OF
WINNING
A
BILLIONDOLLAR
PRIZE
IT
IS
CHEAPER
TO
DEVELOP
YOUR
OWN
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
CHARGING
ITS
ENTIRE
DEVELOPMENT
COST
AGAINST
YOUR
CONTEST
ENTRY
THAN
TO
TRY
TO
DO
IT
WITH
EXISTING
LAUNCHERS
NO
OTHER
DEMAND
IS
NECESSARY
ANY
PLAN
FOR
DOING
SUSTAINED
LUNAR
EXPLORATION
USING
EXISTING
LAUNCH
SYSTEMS
IS
WASTING
MONEY
IN
A
BIG
WAY
THIS
DEPENDS
ON
THE
HOW
SOON
THE
NEW
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
COMES
ON
LINE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
PERHAPS
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
WORTHWHILE
TECHNOLOGY
LIFE
SUPPORT
NAVIGATION
ETC
COULD
BE
DEVELOPED
PRIOR
TO
A
LOW
COST
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
YOU
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
USE
THE
EXPENSIVE
STUFF
FOREVER
BUT
ID
HATE
TO
SEE
FOLKS
WAITING
TO
DO
ANYTHING
UNTIL
A
LOW
COST
MAC
OOPS
I
MEAN
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
COMES
ON
LINE
YOURE
ASSUMING
THAT
ITS
GOING
TO
TAKE
A
DECADE
TO
BUILD
A
NEW
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
BUT
WHY
THE
SATURN
V
TOOK
LESS
THAN
SIX
YEARS
DEPENDING
ON
EXACTLY
WHEN
YOU
DATE
ITS
START
PEGASUS
TOOK
ABOUT
THREE
FROM
PROJECT
START
TO
FIRST
FLIGHT
BEFORE
SDIO
CHICKENED
OUT
ON
ORBITAL
DEVELOPMENT
THE
TARGET
DATE
FOR
AN
ORBITAL
DCY
FLIGHT
WAS
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
SPEED
CONSIDER
THAT
THE
FIRST
PROTOTYPES
OF
THE
THOR
MISSILE
STILL
IN
SERVICE
AS
THE
CORE
OF
THE
DELTA
LAUNCHER
SHIPPED
TO
THE
USAF
LESS
THAN
MONTHS
AFTER
THE
DEVELOPMENT
GOAHEAD
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
PERNICIOUS
MYTHS
IN
THIS
WHOLE
BUSINESS
IS
THE
BELIEF
THAT
YOU
CANT
BUILD
A
LAUNCHER
WITHOUT
TAKING
TEN
YEARS
AND
SPENDING
BILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
IT
ISNT
TRUE
AND
NEVER
WAS
