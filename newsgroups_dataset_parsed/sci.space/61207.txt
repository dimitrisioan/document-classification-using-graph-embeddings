to
previous

when

commercial

growth
rates
this

projected

this
is
the
first
look
at
how
the

commercial

industry
is
expected
to
do
in
in
general
not
a
bad
report
with
most
of
the
bad
news
concentrated
in
the
satellite
manufacturing
area
there
changes
of
only
a
few
satellites
worth
m
or
so
apiece
can
substantially
influence
the
annual
projection
if
we
look
forward
over
several
years
this
market
sector
should
retain
strong
sales
as
us
firms
have
been
very
successful
in
regaining
international
market
share
in
the
satellite
business
furthermore
sales
of
satellite

should
go
up
in
the
next

to

about
mid

data
on
mobile
satellite
ground

sales
including
such

as

and

appears
to
be
missing
from
the
january
data
set
doc
usually
publishes
a
listing
of
space
business
indicators
in
midyear
and
the
next
revision
of
commercial

revenues
should
be
released
then
i
expect
the
revised
revenues
should
easily
top
m
if
the
mobile
satellite
ground
equipment
are
added
back
into
the
numbers
and
the

should
show
about
a
overall

growth
looking
beyond
this

future

look
quite
promising
the
doc
projects
satellite

revenues
could
top
m
by
if
new
mobile

and

are
implemented
as
planned
and
that
mobile
satellite
station
sales
are
expected
to
continue
to
growth
at
per
year
through
the
mid
my
numbers
are
somewhat
more
pessimistic
for
nearterm
market
growth
but
i
agree
the
trend
should
be
for
substantial
growth
in
us
commercial
space
sales
over
at
least
the
next
years
my
pessimism
is
due
to
more
conservative
assumptions
on
market
capture
and
growth
in
leo
communications
and
satellite
direct
broadcasting
services
i
dont
believe
all
of
the
current
players
in
the
yettobeborn
leo
communications
satellite
market
and
in
the
yettobeproven
direct
broadcasting
market
will
be
financial
successes
nor
that

will
be

delta
wins
two
key
launch
contracts
mcdonnell
douglas
corporation
which
builds
and
markets
the
delta
launch
vehicle
has
won
two
important
launch
contracts
motorola
inc
announced
in
mid
february
that
it
had
selected
the
delta
to
launch
most
of
the
satellites
in
the
iridium
leo
communications
constellation
and
in
mid
april
mcdonnell
douglas
was
awarded
the
usaf
medium
launch
vehicle
iii
contract
the
launch
services
contract
with
motorola
for
the
iridium
constellation
launch
is
for
at
launch
of
least
iridium
satellites
another
satellites
have
been
contracted
to
be
launched
by
khrunichev
enterprise
in
russian
on
proton
vehicle
launches
these
satellites
planned
for
the
delta
will
be
launched
at
a
time
providing
for
at
least
launches
additional
satellites
in
the
iridium
constellation
such
as
a
planned
onorbit
spares
may
also
be
launched
on
delta
although
details
of
the
launch
services
contract
were
reported
to
be
negotiation
and
not
yet
final
the
usaf
mlv
contract
also
went
to
mdc
bidding
a
variant
of
their
delta
ii
launcher
this
contract
is
only
initially
worth
million
but
establishes
a
set
of
launch
options
for
up
to
launches
encompassing
launches
from
through
these
launches
will
deploy
the
next
generation
of
the
usafs
global
positioning
system
block
iir
navigation
satellites
plus
other
programs
first
option
for
to
meet
the
usaf
launch
options
is
expected
to
be
exercised
this
year
after
which
the
usaf
is
expected
to
request
launches
of
up
to
deltas
per
year
for
at
least
years
under
this
contract
the
usaf
can
also
request
launch
on
demand
services
from
mdc
for
the
time
period
with
a
launch
to
occur
within
days
of
the
request
commentary
if
these
two
contracts
are
fulfilled
they
should
provide
an
excellent
business
base
for
mdcs
delta
launch
program
through
the
turn
of
the
century
combined
these
two
contracts
have
a
potential
for
about
launches
worth
about
m
to
mdc
and
sustaining
a
core
business
base
of
myear
other
contracts
for
international
and
commercial
payloads
as
well
as
for
nasa
medium
elvclass
payloads
will
add
to
this
business
base
keeping
mdc
as
a
viable
commerical
launch
company
however
it
should
be
noted
there
are
risk
elements
in
these
contracts
motorolas
iridium
leo
communications
constellation
has
not
yet
received
a
us
federal
communications
commission
license
for
operation
in
the
us
nor
has
motorola
lined
up
all
the
financing
and
financial
partners
for
the
iridium
venture
without
these
approvals
or
financial
backing
there
will
be
no
iridium
launches
but
hopefully
these
uncertainties
will
be
settled
this
year
similarly
the
usaf
mlv
iii
program
has
been
the
target
of
several
congressional
actions
which
have
slowed
the
production
of
the
gps
block
iir
satellites
and
deleted
the
funding
for
the
mlv
iii
program
in
favor
of
the
usaf
nlsspacelifter
program
at
this
time
while
it
appears
the
mlv
iii
contract
will
be
executed
future
funding
for
the
mlv
iii
and
other
usaf
commercial
launch
contracts
is
being
reconsidered
as
part
of
national
space
launch
strategy
reviews
some
opinions
expressed
from
within
the
administration
and
congress
propose
cancellation
of
all
elv
upgrade
programs
including
the
mlv
programs
in
favor
of
the
proposed
spacelifter
program
such
opinions
may
have
some
weight
in
this
years
budget
deliberations
particularly
as
dod
funds
will
be
more
difficult
to
find
in
the
shrinking

commercial
remote

venture
gets
doc
goahead
the
first
commercial
license
to
operate
a
remote

satellite
was
approved
in
early
february
by
the
us
department
of
commerces
office
of

commerce
a
license
was
granted
to
worldview

corporation
of

california
to
build

operate
a

of
leo

satellites
to
provide
multispectral

of
the
earth
commentary
there
has
been
little
data
released
on
this
venture
by
worldview
and
the
doc
other
than
the
announcement
of
the
operating
and
construction
license
this
was
reported
to
be
at
the
request
of
worldview
most
industry
speculation
identifies
this
new
venture
as
a
star
wars
spinoff
using
sditype
technology
to
provide
digital
earth

heavily
integrated

users
most
probable
customers
for
this

include

agricultural
planners
and
urban

it
is
noteworthy
this
is
the
first
commercial
venture
under
the
land
remote

policy
act
the
act
as
passed
last
november
provides
that
remote

gathered
from
private
remote

craft
may
be
sold
to
users
at
differing
prices
prior
to
this
act
remote
sensing
data
from
all
satellites
had
to
be
sold
to
all
users
at
the
same
prices
and
private
remote
sensing
ventures
would
have
had
to
sell
at
the
governmentset
landsat

prices
there
are
rumors
of
several
other
potential
commercial
remote
sensing
ventures
working
their
way
through
the
system
at
different
stages
of
development
i
think
the
large
landsat
and
spot
satellite
systems
will
provide
the
majority
of
the
satellite
remote
sensing
data
market
for
the
next
decade
or
so
in
contrast
to
these
large
governmentsponsored
remote
sensing
systems
smaller
market
ventures
such
as
worldview
and
others
can
exploit
market
niches
and
use
innovative
technology
and
i
believe
can
find
profitability
on
the
margin
i
predict
there
may
be
some
very
interesting
ventures
appearing
in
the
next
year

commentary
three
failures

hurt

a
very
few

many

have
been
speculating
gds

be

the
morgan
stanley
report
indicates
gds
space

division
has
some
potential
as
a
moneymaker
despite
current
problems
if
they
can
get
their
act
together
sales
are
projected
to
be
about
m
in
which
will
probably
generate
a
loss
of
about
m
if
gd
can
capture
their
projected
share
of
the
space
launch
market
and
if
they
have
managed
to
clean
up
the
reliability
of
their
atlas
launchers
then
they
could
generate
healthy
profits
from
those
sales
but
until
they
demonstrate
the
atlas
centaur
program
is
back
on
track
this
division
will
continue
to
show
substantial
losses
in
response
to
the
selloff
rumors
in
my
opinion
this
operation
is
not
a
really
good
candidate
for
takeover
and
quick
profitability
to
do
such
a
takeover
the
current
set
corporate
and
divisional
management
would
be
replaced
with
another
set
from
outside
the
firm
in
gd
ssds
case
to
get
the
division
back
on
track
the
management
team
will
have
to
concentrate
hard
on
the
technical
problems
with
the
atlas
centaur
as
well
as
in
selling
atlas
services
this
would
indicate
only
another
firm
with
experience
in
rocket
launch
operations
could
find
such
talent
inhouse
and
be
able
to
convince
customers
to
buy
their
launch
services
optimally
the
firm
would
have
substantial
liquid
rocket
experience
and
experience
in
marketing
space
technology
internationally
as
well
candidates
for
this
might
be
trw
rockwell

ariane
predicts
dip
in

arianespace
the
operator
of
the
ariane

is
projecting
a
dip
in
launch
demand
in
the
late
in
early
february
arianespace
released
their
annual
market
survey
which
detailed
their
projection
of
the
space
transportation
market
for
the
next
decade
over
short
run
arianespace
expects
to
retain
their
dominant
position
and
sustain
a
majority

of

threequarters
of
future
launch
contracts
for
which
ariane
can
compete
are
projected
to
come
from
communications
satellites
with
the
remaining
split
between
weather
earth
observation
and
scientific
satellites
most
of
the
future
telecommunications
demand
growth
is
predicted
to
come
from
the
asiapacific
region
arianespace
expects
the
current
market
consolidation
of
individual
satellite
operators
into
regional
or
national
groups
will
continue
with
these
groups
investing
in
heavier
satellites
with
larger
communications
payloads
carrying
more
transponders
arianespace
predicts
the
average
mass
of
telecommunications
satellites
should
increase
by
over
todays
average
level
to
about
kg
in
geo
demand
for
commercial
launch
services
is
expected
to
remain
strong
over
the
next
three
years
but
in
the
second
half
of
the
decade
arianespace
predicts
demand
will
decrease
arianespace
bases
this
prediction
upon
a
matching
of
satellite
transponder
demand
and
supply
particularly
as
new
data
compression
techniques
appear
to
could
double
or
triple
transponder
capacity
using
existing
or
nearterm
transponders
one
of
the
significant
possible
changes
in
the
market
was
identified
as
the
arrival
of
new
launch
vehicles
including
russian
launch
systems
but
arianespace
predicts
that
in
the
long
term
investors
purchasing
launch
services
are
looking
for
the
best
trade
off
between
launch
service
quality
and
price
and
that
russian
and
other
new
launch
services
will
have
to
prove
out
their
capabilities
and
service
quality
and
their
market
penetration
will
be
minimal
commentary
ariane
releases
their
market
surveys
annually
and
i
reported
on
their
prior
market
survey
in
a
past
issue
of
csnsti
comparing
the
two
surveys
there
arent
outstanding
differences
in
the
numbers
the
most
notable
change
is
the
consideration
of
new
data
compression
techniques
reducing
the
demand
for
new
physical
transponders
on
orbit
i
note
that
in
contrast
to
some
predictions
demand
for
space
based
communications
transponders
appears
to
be
remain
strong
while
fiber
optic
lines
are
making
substantial
inroads
into
the
established
pointtopoint
telecommunications
markets
growing
demand
for
telecommunications
services
world
wide
and
for
pointto
multipoint
broadcast
services
have
prevented
a
decrease
in
space
transponder
demand
fiberoptic
cables
provide
a
higher
capability
service
but
only
from
established
point
a
to
established
point
b
to
establish
a
fiberoptic
link
it
is
necessary
to
install
cable
between
the
points
and
while
there
are
improved
network
solutions
installing
a
large
network
of
distributed
fiberoptic
links
can
cost
millions
or
billions
of
dollars
for
broadcast
services
where
there
is
not
an
existing
ground
network
structure
satellites
still
offer
the
most
cost
effective
solution
and
if
new
services
are
required
into
a
new
region
it
is
cheaper
to
install
a
small
satellite
link
costing
only
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
and
tie
into
the
existing
global
satellite
network
this
allows
rapid
growth
of
new
satellite
services
and
has
kept
demand
high
the
replacement
market
for
fiberoptics
is
growing
as
well
since
as
demand
grows
between
the
points
serviced
it
becomes
cost
effective
to
later
install
a
fiberoptic
link
to
handle
the
increase
in
traffic
since
the
telecommunications
and
data
transfer
markets
are
still
growing
rapidly
satellite
market
projections
remain
rosy
but
satellites
are
also
getting
longer
orbital
lifetimes
current
generation
satellites
are
now
getting
guarantees
of
at
years
of
onorbit
service
or
more
in
contrast
to
years
of
service
from
last
generations
satellites
this
has
cut
back
some
of
the
launch
demand
as
satellite
owners
are
rescheduling
replacement
satellite
launches
over
longer
intervals
and
as
last
note
arianespace
didnt
flag
it
this
year
but
it
looks
like
the
space
transportation
market
will
be
rather
over
supplied
by
existing
launch
systems
in
the
near
term
the
annual
commercial
launch
demand
is
for
about
medium
sized
satellites
per
year
from
the
supply
side
ariane
is
capable
of
launching
up
to
about
a
dozen
medium
sized
satellites
a
year
delta
is
capable
of
about
per
year
atlas
is
capable
of
long
march
japans
hvehicle
russias
proton
capable
of
and
other
systems
such
as
zenit
and
soyuz
another
medium
launches
per
year
thats
a
lot
of
capability
for
a
small
market
we
can
only
expect
the
competition
to
intensify
for
commercial
launches
ntsb
investigates
pegasus
launch
over
aborted
abort
the
feb
pegasus
launch
by
orbital
sciences
corporation
has
spawned
an
investigation
over
an
apparent
violation
of
range
safety
rules
a
valid
abort
order
from
a
nasa
range
safety
officer
to
halt
the
mission
was
overridden
and
the
pegasus
was
launched
in
violation
of
range
safety
rules
in
the
last
few
minutes
of
the
pegasus
launch
countdown
one
of
two
abort
command
receivers
aboard
the
pegasus
failed
such
a
failure
typically
scrubs
a
launchand
a
nasa
range
safety
officer
at
wallops
island
va
issued
a
mission
abort
order
about
a
minute
before
the
scheduled
pegasus
launch
somehow
this
command
was
overridden
by
the
osc
launch
team
or
the
message
was
lost
in
the
communications
channels
and
the
pegasus
was
launched
despite
the
valid
abort
call
fortunately
the
pegasus
functioned
as
expected
and
the
abort
command
receiver
was
not
needed
but
this
incident
did
spark
an
investigation
since
a
valid
abort
order
was
given
under
agreedto
launch
constraint
rules
and
was
not
obeyed
leading
the
investigation
is
the
national
transportation
safety
board
ntsb
with
support
from
nasa
osc
and
the
air
force
this
investigation
marks
the
first
time
ntsb
has
taken
the
lead
on
an
incident
involving
a
space
launch
according
to
the
ntsb
their
investigation
will
take
about
months
and
is
primarily
looking
at
lines
of
authority
communications
links
and
safety
procedures
used
in
the
launch
commentary
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
ntsb
has
led
an
investigation
into
a
space
launch
their
leadership
was
requested
by
the
department
of
commerces
office
of
commercial
space
transportation
who
had
licensed
the
commercial
launch
at
the
time
of
writing
this
column
some
of
the
initial
investigations
have
been
concluded
and
some
of
the
results
are
starting
to
leak
out
into
the
trade
press
apparently
or
four
different
communications
channels
were
in
use
during
the
test
after
the
abort
destruct
receiver
stopped
responding
the
nasa
test
director
and
range
controller
in
the
mission
control
room
at
wallops
island
gave
abort
orders
about
a
minute
before
the
launch
according
to
the
mission
rules
this
should
have
stopped
the
launch
somehow
the
osc
test
conductor
ordered
the
abort
reversed
and
the
nasa
communicator
on
the
net
relayed
that
order
to
the
carrying
the
pegasus
at
about
seconds
before
launch
differing
explainations
of
exactly
how
this
happened
are
proposed
with
the
best
set
being
that
clear
lines
of
communications
and
clear
definition
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
mission
control
team
and
understanding
of
the
mission
rules
were
not
established
before
the
launch
as
we
see
more
and
more
commercial
launches
more
of
these
procedural
issues
are
going
to
crop
up
and
will
have
to
be
resolved
this
case
is
interesting
because
it
is
the
first
time
the
ntsb
has
been
called
in
to
investigate
a
commercial
launch
problem
as
they
do
with
commercial
aircraft
problems
i
think
this
problem
will
turn
out
to
be
primarily
problems
with
procedures
and
communications
and
will
be
cleared
up
with
issuance
of
guidelines
on
how
launch
communications
should
be
set
up
and
how
specific
lines
of
authority
should
be
delineated
another

tsniimach

commentary
theres
very
little
released
information
on
this
new
venture
my
suspicion
is
it
is
another
russian
enterprise
looking
for
hard
currency
and
trying
to
capitalize
upon
their
inhouse
knowledge
of
exsoviet
launch
systems
it
adds
to
the
list
of
numerous
commercial

startups
announced
from

this
ones
a
little
different
in
that
they
are

variants

backing
georgia
launch
site
dropped
from
planning
in
late
january
georgia
tech
research
institute
released
the
results
of
a
preliminary
study
on
the
feasibility
of
a
commercial
rocket
launching
site
in
camden
county
georgia
at
the
old
kingsland
missile
test
launching
site
on
the
atlantic
coast
the
preliminary
study
recommended
the
site
not
be
pursued
as
a
commercial
launch
site
stating
reopening
the
site
was
not
feasible
due
to
projected
low
investment
returns
plus
environmental
and
other
geographic
considerations
however
the
report
did
say
the
site
might
be
ideal
for
other
aerospace
uses
and
recommended
other
potential
uses
commentary
this
should
put
the
nails
in
the
coffin
of
the
kingsland
commercial
launch
site
while
other
sites
are
still
proceeding
with
commercial
launch
site
development
plans
kingsland
found
without
a
key
customer
to
act
as
anchor
tenant
and
if
substantial
infrastructure
had
to
be
put
in
then
the
expected
returns
were
too
low
to
justify
the
cost
of
development
this
might
point
out
some
key
discriminators
in
judging
the
feasibility
of
a
commercial
launch
site
these
include
is
there
an
identified
key
customer
to
provide
core
usage
sufficient
to
recover
setup
costs
is
there
a
market
advantage
of
using
the
site
can
existing
infrastructure
be
used
or
modified
at
the
site
can
financing
be
found
at
low
enough
cost

those

have
to
also
be
judged
against
these
criteria
in
my
opinion
some
of
these

are
flying
on
hope
and
speculation

there
might
be
a
connection
while

the

the

not

there

and

south
korean
press
reports
claim
there
is
also
a
parallel
military
effort
to
establish
the
capabilities
for
building
and
launching
small
military
satellites
by
supposedly
a
government
panel
had
been
established
to
oversee
such
an
effort
funded
at
us
m
between
and
in
anticipation
of
an
expected
pullout
of
us
intelligencegathering
systems
from
the
korean
peninsula
in
conjunction
with
all
of
these
reported
efforts
south
korean
is
also
pursuing
production
work
either
as
offsets
to
existing
aerospace
technology
contracts
for
example
mcdonnell
douglas
is
offsetting
production
of
some
delta
parts
to
south
korean
firms
as
part
of
the
koreasat
launch
contracts
or
for
production
of
consumer
space
items
among
other
products
south
korea
exports
satellite
receiver
television
setups
to
japan
and
samsung
has
announced
teaming
for
production
of
oscs
orbcomm
user
terminals
this
looks
like
a
very
aggressive
push
into
space
technologies
considering
that
east
asia
is
currently
the
fastest
growing
sector
for
commercial
space
services
primarily
for
telecommunications
a
south
korean
push
into
space
technologies
may
change
the
composition
of
commercial
space
market
there
over
the
next
decade
space
technology
indexes
through
march
as
announced
in
the
last
csnsti
each
issue
will
give
the
results
of
stock
indexes
and
portfolios
regarding
space
stocks
and
investments
the
table
below
summarizes
results
to
the
end
of
march
the
space
technology
index
did
quite
a
bit
better
than
the
market
as
a
whole
as
represented
by
the
sp
index
since
of
the
values
included
in
the
index
are
us
firms
this
represents
a
general
increase
in
the
market
value
of
spacerelated
firms
the
increase
in
the
first
quarter
is
more
than
in
all
of
which
is
a
very
promising
sign
although
future
months
may
reverse
this
trend
the
commercial
space
technology
index
has
also
done
quite
well
but
the
pure
play
portfolio
consisting
of
stocks
of
firms
which
are
pure
plays
in
space
technologies
has
also
surpassed
its
results
in
all
of
well
keep
an
