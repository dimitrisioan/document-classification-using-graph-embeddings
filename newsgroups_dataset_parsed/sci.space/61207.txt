THIS

AT

US
M
THROUGH
I
HAVENT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ESTABLISH
ANY
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THIS
VENTURE
AND
THOSE
OF
THE
NSPOT
BUT
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
CONNECTION
WHILE
TAIWAN
HAS
THE
FINANCING
TO
PURSUE
SEVERAL
VENTURES
THE
CURRENT
TAIWANESE
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
MARKET
MIGHT
NOT
SUPPORT
TWO
SEPARATE
SASTELLITE
VENTURES
THE
REPORTED

FOR

SYSTEM
IS
ASIASAT
BUT
I
DONT
THINKS
THIS
HAS
ANY
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE

KONGBASED
ASIASAT
PROGRAM
INVOLVING
CHINESE
HONG
KONG
AND
OTHER
ASIAN

OTHER
THAN
USING
IT
AS
AN
ORGANIZATIONAL
MODEL
THERE
ARE
SOME
OBVIOUS
ADVANTAGES
TO
PURSUING
SUCH
A
JOING
VENTURE
IT
COULD
PROVIDE
EXCELLENT
FIRSTHAND
EXPERIENCE
TO
TAIWAN
FOR
A
VERY
LOW
COST
WHICH
THEN
CAN
BE
USED
IN
LATER
SATELLITE
VENTURES
BUT
THERE
ARE
INTERNAL
POLITICAL
ISSUES
BETWEEN
TAIWANESE
AND
CHINESE
VENTURES
BUT
PUTTING
ANY
JOINT
VENTURE
THROUGH
A
HONG

CORPORATION
MIGHT
ALLOW
IT
TO

IN
