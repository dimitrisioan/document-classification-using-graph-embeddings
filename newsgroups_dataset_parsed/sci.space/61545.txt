RE
SPACE
MANUEVERING
TUG
WAS
HST
SERVICING
MISSION
PRBACCESSDIGEXNET
PAT
WRITES
I
WROTE
PRBACCESSDIGEXNET
PAT
WRITES
GIVEN
THAT
WHAT
I
DESCRIBED
FOR
THE
HST
SEEMED
TO
BE
THE
SMT
HAS
SOMEONE
ACTUALLY
VERIFIED
THAT
MASS
IS
THE
PREDOMINANT
CONSTRAINT
ON
THIS
MISSION
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
ASSUMING
IT
WITHOUT
GIVING
SUPPORTING
EVIDENCE
SOMEONE
FROM
NASA
POSTED
THAT
THERE
WERE
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
MASS
MARGINS
ON
THE
HST
REBOOST
MISSION
A
WHILE
BACK
I
HAD
ASKED
WHY
NOT
CARRY
THE
EDO
PALLET
UP
AND
THE
ANSWER
WAS
THE
MASS
MARGINS
WERE
TIGHT
ENOUGH
THEY
WERENT
EVEN
CARRYING
EXTRA
SUITS
SO
HOW
MUCH
MASS
IS
SAVED
BY
NOT
BURNING
THE
OMS
THATS
THE
CRITICAL
QUESTION
MY
DATA
SHOWS
THAT
THE
OMS
ENGINES
HOLD
KG
OF
PROPELLANT
OF
THAT
A
SUBSTANTIAL
FRACTION
IS
GOING
TO
BE
USED
FOR
THE
FIRST
OMS
BURN
THE
REENTRY
BURN
AND
THE
RESERVE
SO
PAT
TELL
US
HOW
MUCH
FUEL
THE
ALTITUDE
CHANGE
IS
GOING
TO
TAKE
AND
HOW
MUCH
THE
EDO
PALLET
AND
EXTRA
PARTS
ARE
GOING
MASS
IF
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THE
NUMBERS
WORK
OUT
THEN
ILL
BE
INTERESTED
AFTER
YOU
SHOW
US
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
DONE
THEN
TELL
US
HOW
MUCH
THE
EDO
PALLET
AND
EXTRA
EQUIPMENT
IS
GOING
TO
COST
WHY
NOT
DO
THIS
QUICK
TEST
GOLDINS
PHILOSOPHJY
OF
FASTER
CHEAPER
BETTER
BUILD
A
REAL
FAST
SPACE
TUG
TO
HANDLE
THE
REBOOST
OF
THE
HST
USING
CLEAN
CRYO
FUELS
AND
GET
IT
READY
BEFORE
THE
HST
MISSION
PAT
THIS
WOULD
BE
SLOWER
MORE
EXPENSIVE
AND
WORSE
WHERES
WINGO
WHEN
YOU
NEED
HIM
COME
ON
KNOCK
THAT
ST
OFF
YOU
FORGET
THAT
DURING
SKYLAB
THEY
DID
OVERNIGHT
MISSION
PLANNING
FOR
THE
REPAIR
EVAS
ALSO
DURING
THEXD
INTELSAT
MISSION
THEY
DID
OVERNIGHT
WETF
SIMULATIONS
I
SOMEHOW
THINK
THEY
COULD
TRAIN
UP
A
NEW
EVA
IN
MONTHS
FIRST
WHILE
ASTRONAUTS
CERTAINLY
HAVE
DONE
EVAS
WITH
MINIMAL
PLANNING
THAT
WAS
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
TO
THEY
DONT
LIKE
TO
DO
THAT
AS
A
GENERAL
RULE
SECOND
REMEMBER
WHY
THEY
HAD
TO
IMPROVISE
DURING
INTELSAT
THEY
WERE
TRYING
TO
ATTACH
A
MOTOR
TO
A
PIECE
OF
HARDWARE
THAT
WASNT
DESIGNED
TO
DO
THAT
TRYING
TO
SHORTCUT
THE
TRAINING
IS
ONLY
GOING
TO
MAKE
A
REPEAT
MORE
LIKELY
THIRD
THEY
DONT
HAVE
EIGHT
MONTHS
THEY
HAVE
HOWEVER
MUCH
TIME
IS
LEFT
AFTER
SOMEONE
COMES
UP
WITH
A
PLAN
SHOWS
IT
CAN
WORK
AND
GETS
IT
APPROVED
YOU
MAY
THINK
I
HAVE
A
PESSIMISTIC
ATTITUDE
I
THINK
ITS
REALISTIC
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
THE
ENGINEERING
TASK
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FEW
ENGINEERING
TASKS
ARE
WHAT
IM
SAYING
IS
THAT
THIS
IS
NEITHER
COST
EFFECTIVE
NOR
FEASIBLE
UNDER
NASA
MANAGEMENT
AND
AS
FOR
BUILDING
HARDWARE
ANYTHING
CAN
BE
BUILT
IF
YOU
WANT
IT
BAD
ENOUGH
YOU
FORGET
THE
BUS
IS
ALREADY
BUILT
ALL
THEYD
AHVE
TO
DO
IS
SOUP
IT
UP
EVEN
TEST
IT
ON
A
DELTA
MISSION
ALL
THEY
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
SOUP
IT
UP
JUST
WHAT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
DONT
GET
INTO
THIS
MODE
OF
NEGATIVISM
BESIDES
AT
THE
RATE
MISSIONS
SLIP
THE
DISCOVERY
WONT
LAUNCH
ON
THIS
MISSION
UNTIL
MARCH
THATS
ALMOST
A
YEAR
MORE
EXPENSIVE
YOUR
PROPOSAL
STILL
REQUIRES
THE
SHUTTLE
TO
DO
EVERYTHING
IT
WAS
GOING
TO
DO
EXECPT
FIRE
THE
OMS
IN
ADDITION
YOUVE
ADDED
SIGNIFICANT
EXTRA
COST
FOR
A
NEW
PIECE
OF
COMPLEX
HARDWARE
AH
BUT
HOW
MUCH
MORE
EXPENSIVE
IS
THE
SECOND
HST
SERVICING
MISSION
THE
SECOND
SERVICING
MISSION
IS
A
CONTINGENCY
YOU
HAVE
NEITHER
SHOWN
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
WITHOUT
YOUR
PLAN
NOR
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
UNNECESSARY
WITH
YOUR
PLAN
YOU
FORGET
THERE
IS
A
BUM
FGS
THE
SOLAR
ARRAY
ELECTRONICS
ARE
GETTING
HINKY
AND
THERE
IS
STILL
MONTHS
UNTIL
THE
SERVICING
MISSION
NO
PAT
I
HAVENT
FORGOTTEN
IF
THE
SMT
CAN
AVOID
A
SECOND
SERVICING
MISSION
THATS
MILLION
SAVED
NO
PAT
THATS
MILLION
MINUS
THE
COST
OF
THE
NEW
HARDWARE
MINUS
THE
COST
OF
THE
EXTRA
STRUFF
YOU
WANT
TO
BRING
ALONG
MINUS
DEVELOPMENT
AND
MANGEMENT
COSTS
MINUS
EXTRA
OPERATING
COSTS
TANSTAAFL
ACCORDING
TO
A
GAO
REPORT
ON
THE
OMV
I
HAVE
BEFORE
ME
THERE
ARE
ONLY
TWO
CURRENTLY
PLANNED
MISSIONS
THAT
COULD
USE
SUCH
A
VEHICLE
HST
AND
AXAF
SINCE
AXAF
HAS
SINCE
BEEN
SCALED
BACK
AND
HST
CAN
RELY
ON
THE
SHUTTLE
THERE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
ANY
NEED
FOR
YOUR
VEHICLE
OF
COURSE
THERE
WASNT
ANY
NEED
FOR
THE
SATURN
V
AFTER
APOLLO
TOO
IM
SURE
THAT
IF
YOU
REREAD
THIS
YOULL
SEE
THAT
YOUR
ARGUMENT
IS
FALACIOUS
AS
FOR
THE
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
APERTURE
DOOR
I
AM
SURE
THEY
CAN
WORK
OUT
SOME
WAY
TO
HANDLE
THAT
MAYBE
A
PLUG
MADE
FROM
FROZEN
ICE
ITLL
KEEP
OUT
ANY
CONTAMINATION
YET
SUBLIME
AWAY
AFTER
TEH
BOOST
PAT
NOT
ONLY
IS
THIS
MESSY
AND
LESS
RELIABLE
THAN
A
DEVICE
THATS
MADE
TO
PERFORM
THIS
TASK
IT
ALSO
IGNORES
THE
POINT
THERE
IS
A
DESIRE
TO
HAVE
ASTRONAUTS
AVAILABLE
SO
THAT
IF
THE
DOOR
FAILS
TO
OPEN
SOMETHING
CAN
BE
DONE
ABOUT
IT
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
PROVIDE
A
VERY
RELIABLE
WAY
OF
REOPENING
THE
DOOR
YOU
HAVENT
SOLVED
THE
PROBLEM
JOSH
HOPKINS
FIND
A
WAY
OR
MAKE
ONE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
HANNIBAL
