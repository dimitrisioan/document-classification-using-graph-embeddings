the

was
caused
by
a
russian
rocket
i
dont
know
if
there
were
satellite
launches
in
plesetsk
cosmodrome
near
arkhangelsk
but
this
may
be
a
rocket
experiment
too
since
we
have
observed
over
rocket
phenomena
in
finland
most
of
these
are
rocket
experiments
military
missile
tests
barium
experiments
and
other
chemical
releases
during
these
years
we
have
observed
satellite
launches
