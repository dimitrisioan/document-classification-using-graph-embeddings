A
BRIGHT
LIGHT
PHENOMENON
WAS
OBSERVED
IN
THE
EASTERN
FINLAND
ON
APRIL
AT
UT
TWO
PEOPLE
SAW
A
BRIGHT
LUMINOUS
PILLARSHAPED
PHENOMENON
IN
THE
LOW
EASTERN
HORIZONT
NEAR
MIKKELI
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
PILLAR
WAS
CIRCULAR
THE
LOWER
PART
WAS
A
LITTLE
WINDING
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
MONSTER
THEY
TOLD
THEY
WERE
LITTLE
FRIGHTENED
SOON
THE
YELLOWISH
PILLAR
BECAME
ENLARGED
A
BRIGHT
SPOT
LIKE
THE
SUN
WAS
APPEARED
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
PHENOMENON
AT
LAST
THE
LIGHT
LANDED
BEHIND
THE
NEARBY
FOREST
NOW
THERE
WAS
ONLY
LUMINOUS
TRAILS
IN
THE
SKY
WHICH
WERE
VISIBLE
TILL
MORNING
SUNRISE
THE
SAME
PHENOMENON
WAS
OBSERVED
ALSO
BY
JAAKKO
KOKKONEN
IN
LAPPEENRANTA
AT
UT
HE
SAW
A
LUMINOUS
YELLOWISH
TRAIL
IN
THE
LOW
NORTHEASTERN
HORIZONT
THE
ALTITUDE
OF
THE
TRAIL
WAS
ONLY
ABOUT
DEGREES
SOON
THE
TRAIL
BEGAN
TO
GROW
TALLER
A
LOOP
WAS
APPEARED
IN
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
TRAIL
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
SPOON
THIS
LASTED
ONLY
SECONDS
NOW
THE
ALTITUDE
WAS
ABOUT
FIVE
DEGRESS
ABOVE
HORIZONT
HE
NOTED
A
BRIGHT
SPOT
AT
THE
UPPER
STAGE
OF
LOOP
THE
SPOT
WAS
AT
MAGNITUDE
THE
LOOP
BECAME
ENLARGED
AND
THE
SPOT
WAS
NOW

SPOT
AFTER
A
MINUTE
THE
SPOT
DISAPPEARED
AND
ONLY
FUZZY
TRAILS
WERE
ONLY
VISIBLE
IN
THE
LOW
HORIZONT
LUMINOUS
TRAILS
WERE
STILL
VISIBLE
AT
UT
IN
THE
MORNING
SKY
THE
PHENOMENON
WAS
CAUSED
BY
A
RUSSIAN
ROCKET
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THERE
WERE
SATELLITE
LAUNCHES
IN
PLESETSK
COSMODROME
NEAR
ARKHANGELSK
BUT
THIS
MAY
BE
A
ROCKET
EXPERIMENT
TOO
SINCE
WE
HAVE
OBSERVED
OVER
ROCKET
PHENOMENA
IN
FINLAND
MOST
OF
THESE
ARE
ROCKET
EXPERIMENTS
MILITARY
MISSILE
TESTS
BARIUM
EXPERIMENTS
AND
OTHER
CHEMICAL
RELEASES
DURING
THESE
YEARS
WE
HAVE
OBSERVED
