WRITES
IF
I
READ
YOU
RIGHT
YOURE
SAYING
IN
ESSENCE
THAT
WITH
A
LARGER
ECONOMY
NATIONS
WILL
HAVE
MORE
DISCRETIONARY
FUNDS
TO
WASTE
ON
A
LUNAR
FACILITY
THAT
WAS
CERTAINLY
PARTIALLY
THE
CASE
WITH
APOLLO
BUT
REAL
LUNAR
COLONIES
WILL
PROBABLY
REQUIRE
A
CONTINUING
MILITARY
SCIENTIFIC
OR
COMMERCIAL
REASON
FOR
BEING
RATHER
THAN
JUST
A
WE
HAVE
THE
MONEY
WHY
NOT
APPROACH
AH
BUT
THE
WHOLE
POINT
IS
THAT
MONEY
SPENT
ON
A
LUNAR
BASE
IS
NOT
WASTED
ON
THE
MOON
ITS
NOT
LIKE
THEYD
BE
USING
BILLS
TO
FUEL
THEIR
MOONDOZERS
THE
MONEY
TO
FUND
A
LUNAR
BASE
WOULD
BE
SPENT
IN
THE
COUNTRY
TO
WHICH
THE
BASE
BELONGED
ITS
A
WAY
OF
FUNDING
HIGHTECH
RESEARCH
JUST
LIKE
DARPA
WAS
A
GOOD
EXCUSE
TO
FUND
VARIOUS
FIELDS
OF
RESEARCH
UNDER
THE
PRETENSE
THAT
IT
WAS
CRUCIAL
TO
THE
DEFENSE
OF
THE
COUNTRY
OR
LIKE
ESPRIT
IS
A
GOOD
EXCUSE
FOR
THE
EC
TO
FUND
RESEARCH
UNDER
THE
PRETENSE
THAT
ITS
GOOD
FOR
PANEUROPEAN
COOPERATION
NOW
MAYBE
YOU
THINK
THAT
GOVERNMENTFUNDED
RESEARCH
IS
A
WASTE
OF
MONEY
IN
FACT
IM
PRETTY
SURE
YOU
DO
BUT
IT
DOES
COUNT
AS
INVESTMENT
SPENDING
WHICH
DOES
BOOST
THE
ECONOMY
AND
JUST
LOOK
AT
THE
SIZE
OF
THAT
MULTIPLIER
ACTUALLY
I
FAVOR
GOVERNMENT
FUNDED
RESEARCH
IT
IS
A
PUMP
PRIME
FOR
A
LOT
OF
BASIC
TECHNOLOGIES
I
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THE
SHORT
TERM
VALUE
OF
HIGH
TECH
WELFARE
PROGRAMS
BUT
THEY
CANT
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
LONG
RANGE
WEALTH
GENERATION
VIA
COMMERCIAL
ENTERPRISE
THATS
WHATS
NEEDED
TO
MAINTAIN
A
HEALTHY
ECONOMY
ANYWHERE
ON
EARTH
OR
LUNA
I
DONT
SEE
THAT
LONG
TERM
POTENTIAL
ON
LUNA
DUE
TO
A
BUNCH
OF
FACTORS
