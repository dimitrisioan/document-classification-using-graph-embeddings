BATSE
IS
AN
ALTOGETHER
DIFFERENT
BEAST
EFFECTIVELY
JUST
COINCIDENCE
COUNTERS
ONE
ON
EACH
CORNER
OF
THE
CRAFT
POSITIONAL
INFORMATION
IS
TRIANGULATED
FROM
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
SIGNAL
ARRIVAL
TIMES
AT
EACH
OF
THE
DETECTORS
OBVIOUSLY
NOT
COUNT
RATES
ARE
TOO
LOW
AND
SIGNAL
RISE
TIMES
TOO
LONG
FOR
THIS
TO
BE
POSSIBLE
THE
CGRO
IS
WHAT
METERS
LONG
YOUD
NEED
TO
TIME
TO
AN
ACCURACY
OF
NANOSECONDS
TO
DO
THIS
WHAT
BATSE
ACTUALLY
DOES
IS
MEASURE
THE
RELATIVE
STRENGTH
IN
EACH
OF
THE
DETECTORS
ALSO
AS
A
FUNCTION
OF
PHOTON
ENERGY
EACH
OF
THE
DETECTORS
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ISOTROPIC
RESPONSE
TO
DO
THIS
RIGHT
ONE
MUST
MODEL
THE
SCATTERING
OF
PHOTONS
IN
THE
MATERIAL
AROUND
EACH
DETECTOR
AND
EVEN
SCATTERING
OF
PHOTONS
OFF
THE
EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE
BACK
ONTO
THE
SPACECRAFT
I
BELIEVE
THEY
HAVE
NOW
REDUCED
THE
ERROR
TO
ABOUT
