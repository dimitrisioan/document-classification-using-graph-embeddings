IN
DOWNEY
CALIFORNIA
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
THE
OTHER
SHUTTLE
CONTRACTORS
DELIVERED
THE
WORLDS
MOST
IMPORTANT
AND
MOST
REVOLUTIONARY
SPACE
VEHICLE
HA
ONE
CANNOT
ARGUE
WITH
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
FLIES
LANDS
AND
IS
REUSABLE
WATCH
ME
IT
FLIES
IT
LANDS
IT
GETS
REBUILT
IN
MY
OPINION
THESE
WERE
THE
ONLY
APPROPRIATE
SPECIFICATIONS
FOR
THIS
PROGRAM
THATS
NOT
WHAT
THEY
TOLD
US
BACK
IN
THE
IT
HAS
BEEN
A
TEST
PROGRAM
FROM
THE
START
A
LOGICAL
FOLLOW
TO
THE
PROGRAM
AND
THE
LATER
XSERIES
LIFTING
BODIES
IT
ISNT
A
LOGICAL
FOLLOWON
A
LOGICAL
FOLLOWON
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EITHER
A
RUSSIAN
SNOWFOX
TYPE
THINGEY
FOR
THE
LIFTING
BODIES
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
MMIS
SPACE
VAN
OR
BOEINGS
TSTO
OR
THE
AIRBREATHING
TSTO
THE
MILITARY
IS
ALLEGEDLY
USING
NOW
THAT
PROBABLY
COST
LESS
TO
DEVELOP
THAN
THE
SHUTTLE
DOES
TO
FLY
FOR
A
YEAR
THE
ENGINEERING
SPECS
THAT
THE
GUYS
IN
THE
TRENCHES
HAD
WERE
TO
DEVELOP
A
SYSTEM
WHICH
WAS
MANRATABLE
COULD
LAND
RELIABLY
AND
COULD
BE
REFLOWN
THESE
GOALS
WERE
QUITE
VISIONARY
FOR
THE
AND
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
THEY
ARE
CHALLENGING
EVEN
TODAY
INCLUDING
FOR
THE
DCX
PROGRAM
KEEP
THAT
ATTITUDE
AND
ITLL
BE
A
COUPLE
CENTURIES
BEFORE
WE
GET
REAL
ACCESS
TO
SPACE
UNLESS
ANOTHER
COUNTRY
WITHOUT
ALL
THAT
BAGGAGE
COMES
ALONG
AND
KICKS
OUR
ASS
IN
THE
SPACE
RACE
I
DO
NOT
RECALL
A
FLIGHTWEEK
SPECIFICATION
IN
THE
FINAL
NASA
SPECS
FOR
THE
SPACE
SHUTTLE
PROGRAM
IF
YOU
HAVE
SUCH
DOCUMENTS
I
WOULD
FIND
THEM
MOST
REVEALING
AND
INTERESTING
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
THE
ONLY
PEOPLE
TOUTING
A
FLIGHT
PER
WEEK
FLIGHT
RATE
WERE
PEOPLE
ON
CAPITOL
HILL
OR
SELLING
BOOKS
TO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
OR
NASA
HQ
THAT
DOESNT
GIVE
THE
REST
OF
THE
PROGRAM
PLAUSIBLE
DENIABILITY
IF
WE
DECEIDE
THAT
IT
WASNT
WORTH
THE
MONEY
WEVE
SPENT
WHICH
IS
BY
NOW
PROBABLY
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
APOLLO
IMHO
POLITICAL
STATEMENTS
IN
THE
HALLS
OF
THE
US
CONGRESS
ARE
NOT
ADMISSABLE
AS
ENGINEERING
SPECS
BECAUSE
SPECS
SHOULD
BE
DETERMINED
BY
NASADOD
AND
CONTRACTORS
NOT
BY
CONGRESSMEN
SENATORS
OR
PRESIDENTS
MISSIONS
ARE
DEFINED
BY
POLITICAL
LEADERS
BUT
NOT
THE
ENGINEERING
SPECS
YES
BUT
IT
GETS
SOLD
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
POLITICAL
STATEMENTS
YOURE
SAYING
BASICALLY
THAT
IT
MET
THE
ENGINEERING
SPECS
WHICH
IS
QUESTIONABLE
IMHO
SO
ITS
A
SUCCESS
NEVER
MIND
THAT
YOU
COULDNT
GET
THE
FUNDING
THE
SHUTTLE
EATS
WITH
THOSE
ENGINEERING
SPECS
IN
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
THE
SHUTTLE
IS
THE
ONLY
REUSABLE
SPACE
VEHICLE
THIS
AUTOMATICALLY
QUALIFIES
IT
AS
AN
UNPARALLELED
ENGINEERING
SUCCESS
YOU
COULD
ARGUE
ABOUT
ITS
POLITICAL
SUCCESS
BUT
ENGINEERING
WISE
IT
IS
CLEARLY
THE
MOST
ADVANCED
MACHINE
EVER
FLOWN
I
ARGUE
THAT
ENGINEERING
AND
TECHNICAL
DATA
FOR
HYPERSONIC
FLIGHT
IS
VALUABLE
IN
AND
OF
ITSELF
SHUTTLE
SHOULD
BE
JUSTIFIED
OR
CRITICIZED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
ECONOMICS
YOU
CAN
GET
HYPERSONIC
FLIGHT
DATA
WITH
AN
OR
A
FOLLOWON
TYPE
VEHICLE
FOR
MUCH
LESS
AND
ECONOMICS
AND
ENGINEERING
ARE
INTERCHANGABLE
ENGINEERING
IN
THE
ABSENSE
OF
ECONOMICS
IS
BASICALLY
JUST
PHYSICS
AND
IN
TERMS
OF
PHYSICS
THE
SHUTTLE
LOOKS
LIKE
A
FAILURE
NEXT
TO
THE
THEN
HENRY
WROTE
HSSORRY
SUPPORT
THAT
I
CAN
ARRANGE
FOR
LAUNCHERS
ALL
GOES
TO
LAUNCHERS
HSTHAT
I
HAVE
SOME
HOPE
OF
RIDING
SOME
DAY
AT
THE
MOMENT
THATS
HSDCXS
HOPEDFOR
SUCCESSORS
I
WAS
DISAPPOINTED
BY
THIS
AND
OTHER
SIMILAR
STATEMENTS
FROM
THOSE
VOCAL
IN
SUPPORT
OF
THE
DCX
PROGRAM
YOUR
SUPPORT
OF
DCX
IS
BASED
ON
HOPES
MY
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
SHUTTLE
PROGRAM
IS
BASED
ON
RECORD
THE
SHUTTLE
PROGRAM
HAS
A
BAD
RECORD
I
ONCE
HAD
HOPES
FOR
THE
SHUTTLE
PROGRAM
BY
NOW
I
KNOW
THOSE
HOPES
WERE
FALSE
ALL
I
HAVE
FOR
DCX
AND
SIMILAR
AND
DISSIMILAR
EXPERIMENTAL
VEHICLES
ARE
HOPES
BUT
AT
LEAST
I
KNOW
THEY
ARENT
FALSE
HOPES
YET
I
DID
SUPPORT
THE
SHUTTLE
WAY
BACK
WHEN
IT
DIDNT
DO
NEARLY
WHAT
IT
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
ITS
TIME
TO
MOVE
ON
TO
SOMETHING
THAT
MIGHT
DO
THE
JOB
OF
ORBITAL
DELIVERY
BETTER
OR
AT
ALL
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
ALSO
IMPORTANT
TO
NOTE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
OBJECT
TO
DCX
IT
IS
VISIONARY
I
ORIGINALLY
POSTED
I
LIKE
THE
DCX
IDEA
AND
I
AM
REALLY
HOPEFUL
THAT
ITLL
BE
A
STUNNING
SUCCESS
UNFORTUNATELY
DCXERS
ARE
NOT
WILLING
TO
RETURN
THAT
SUPPORT
THE
PROVEN
SHUTTLE
PROGRAM
EXPLAIN
WHY
YOU
FOLKS
CRITICIZE
SHUTTLE
WHEN
SHUTTLE
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
YOU
GUYS
NEED
IN
ORDER
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
OPERATE
DCX
ONORBIT
WE
DONT
WANT
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
OPERATE
ON
ORBIT
IT
LAUNCHES
IT
SHOVES
OUT
THE
PAYLOAD
IT
LANDS
IT
DOESNT
WASTE
PAYLOAD
HAULING
UP
AND
DOWN
EDO
PALLETS
AND
THE
LIKE
THE
ONLY
THING
TO
BE
LEARNED
FROM
SHUTTLE
IS
HOW
NOT
TO
BUILD
A
LAUNCHER
FINALLY
THAT
BIT
ABOUT
THE
PROVEN
SHUTTLE
ARE
YOU
HOPING
YOU
CAN
TELL
A
LIE
ENOUGH
TIMES
AND
GET
SOMEONE
TO
BELIEVE
IT
I
ENJOYED
YOUR
LATER
POSTINGS
REGARDING
THE
COMPARISONS
BETWEEN
THE
SHUTTLE
AND
THE
SOYUZ
PROJECT
ALTHOUGH
I
MAY
DISAGREE
WITH
YOUR
METHOD
OF
ANALYSIS
YOU
PROBABLY
WILL
DISAGREE
WITH
MINE
I
THINK
THAT
THE
TOTAL
IMPACT
OF
THE
SHUTTLE
PROGRAM
MUST
BE
JUDGED
ON
THE
SCIENTIFIC
AND
TECHNICAL
MERIT
NOT
ON
TIMELINES
AND
SCHEDULES
DO
YOU
AGREE
HOW
MUCH
SCIENCE
AND
TECHNOLOGY
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
IS
THE
MONEY
SPENT
ON
SHUTTLE
HAD
BEEN
SPENT
DIFFERENTLY
AS
FOR
NOW
WE
NEED
TO
STOP
THINKING
OF
DCX
AND
SHUTTLE
AS
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
LEARN
ABOUT
ECONOMICS
AND
THE
CURRENT
BUDGET
REALITIES
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
PLEASE
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
TIME
PHIL
FRAERING
NUMBER

GOOD
FAITH
YOU

NOT
TORTURED
