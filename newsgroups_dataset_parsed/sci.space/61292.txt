WRITES
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
THOUGHTS
ON
WHAT
MAKES
A
PLANET
HABITABLE
FOR
HUMANS
I
AM
MAKING
ASUMPTIONS
THAT
LIFE
AND
A
SIMILAR
ATMOSPHERE
EVOLVE
GIVEN
A
RANGE
OF
PHYSICAL
ASPECTS
OF
THE
PLANET
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
PHYSICAL
ASPECTS
SIMPLY
DISALLOW
EARTH
LIKE
CONDITIONS
EG
TEMPERATURE
RANGE
OF
TO
WHERE
TEMP
IS
PURELY
DEPENDANT
ON
DIST
FROM
THE
SUN
AND
THE
SUNS
TEMPERATURE
ATMOSPHERIC
PRESURE
I
KNOW
NOTHING
OF
HUMAN
TOLERANCE
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
ADAPTED
TO
HIGH
ALTITUDES
IN
THE
ANDES
AND
IN
TIBET
I
SUSPECT
THAT
IT
TOOK
THEM
SEVERAL
GENERATIONS
TO
MAKE
THE
ADAPTATION
BECAUSE
EUROPEANS
HAD
DIFFICULTY
MAKING
THE
ADAPTATION
THEY
HAD
TO
SEND
THE
WOMEN
TO
A
LOWER
ALTITUDE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
PREGNANT
IN
ORDER
TO
INSURE
SUCESSFUL
CHILDBIRTH
PLANETARY
MASS
AGAIN
GRAVITY
AT
SURFACE
IS
IMPORTANT
HOW
MUCH
CAN
HUMAN
BODIES
TAKE
DAY
AFTER
DAY
ALSO
HOW
DOES
THE
MASS
EFFECT
ATMOSPHERE
I
THINKING
OF
PLANETS
BETWEEN
AND
TIMES
MASS
OF
THE
EARTH
I
SUPPOSE
DENSITY
SHOULD
BE
IMPORTANT
AS
WELL
ANOTHER
FACTOR
YOU
SHOULD
CONSIDER
IS
THE
XRAY
OPACITY
OF
THE
ATMOSPHERE
IN
CASE
OF
STELLAR
FLARES
THE
UV
OPACITY
IS
ALSO
IMPORTANT
BECAUSE
UV
RADIATION
CAN
KILL
OR
DAMAGE
MICROBES
PLANTS
AND
ANIMALS
CLIMATE
ETC
DOES
NOT
CONCERN
ME
NOR
DOES
AXIAL
TILT
ETC
ETC
JUST
THE
ABOVE
THREE
FACTORS
AND
HOW
THEY
RELATE
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
