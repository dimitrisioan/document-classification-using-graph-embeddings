re
vandalizing
the
sky
re
space
billboards
even
easier
to
implement
than
writing
messages
on
the
moon
once
upon
a
time
a
group
of
space
activists
i
belonged
to
in
seattle
considered
a
goodyear
blimp
in
orbit
the
idea
was
to
use
a
large
structure
that
could
carry
an
array
of
lights
like
the
goodyear
blimp
has
placed
in
a
low
earth
orbit
of
high
inclination
it
could
eventually
be
seen
by
almost
everyone
on
earth
only
our
collective
disapproval
of
cluttering
up
space
with
such
a
thing
stopped
us
from
pursuing
it
it
had
quite
feasible
economics
which
i
will
not
post
here
because
i
dont
want
to
encourage
the
idea
if
you
want
to
do
such
a
thing
go
figure
it
out
for
yourself
