VANDALIZING

BILLBOARDS
EVEN

ONCE
UPON
A
TIME
A
GROUP
OF
SPACE
ACTIVISTS
I
BELONGED
TO
IN
SEATTLE
CONSIDERED
A
GOODYEAR
BLIMP
IN
ORBIT
THE
IDEA
WAS
TO
USE
A
LARGE
STRUCTURE
THAT
COULD
CARRY
AN
ARRAY
OF
LIGHTS
LIKE
THE
GOODYEAR
BLIMP
HAS
PLACED
IN
A
LOW
EARTH
ORBIT
OF
HIGH
INCLINATION
IT
COULD
EVENTUALLY
BE
SEEN
BY
ALMOST
EVERYONE
ON
EARTH
ONLY
OUR
COLLECTIVE
DISAPPROVAL
OF
CLUTTERING
UP
SPACE
WITH
SUCH
A
THING
STOPPED
US
FROM
PURSUING
IT
IT
HAD
QUITE
FEASIBLE
ECONOMICS
WHICH
I
WILL
NOT
POST
HERE
BECAUSE
I
DONT
WANT
TO
ENCOURAGE
THE
IDEA
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
SUCH
A
THING
GO
FIGURE
IT
OUT
FOR
YOURSELF
