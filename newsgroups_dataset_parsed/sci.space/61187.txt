ANSWER
TO
A
QUESTION
FROM
HAWKING
CHAHINE
DESCRIBED
A
PROPOSED
DRAGFREE
SATELLITE
BUT
CONFIRMED
THAT
AT
THIS
POINT
ITS
ONLY
A
CONCEPT
SO
WHATS
A
DRAG
FREE
SATELLITE
COATED
WITH
I
AM
PUZZLED
BY
THE
TERM
CONCEPT
DRAG
FREE
MAY
ALREADY
HAVE
BEEN
FLOWN
IT
WAS
THE
IDEA
BEHIND
PUTTING
UP
A
SPACECRAFT
THAT
WOULD
MORE
ACCURATELY
RESPOND
TO
MOTIONS
FROM
THE
EARTHS
GRAVITY
FIELD
AND
IGNORE
DRAG
IT
WAS
PROPOSED
MANY
YEARS
AGO
AND
INVOLVED
A
BALL
FLOATING
BETWEEN
SENSORS
WHOSE
JOB
IT
WAS
TO
SIGNAL
TO
LITTLE
ADJUSTMENT
JETS
TO
KEEP
THE
BALL
AWAY
FROM
THEM
THE
BALL
ITSELF
WOULD
THEN
BE
IN
A
DRAG
FREE
CONDITION
AND
RESPOND
ONLY
TO
GRAVITY
ANISOTROPIES
WHEREAS
THE
SPACECRAFT
ITSELF
WOULD
BE
CONTINUOUSLY
ADJUSTING
ITS
POSITION
TO
COMPENSATE
FOR
DRAG
