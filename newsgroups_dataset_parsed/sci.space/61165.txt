PROPOSED
THIS
DESIGN
AT
JOE
SHEAS
COMMITTEE
IN
CRYSTAL
CITY
AND
HE
REPORTS
THAT
HE
WAS
WARMLY
RECEIVED
HOWEVER
THE
RUMORS
I
HEAR
SAY
THAT
A
DESIGN
BASED
ON
A
WINGLESS
SPACE
SHUTTLE
ORBITER
SEEMS
MORE
LIKELY
YO
KEN
LETS
KEEP
ONTOP
OF
THINGS
BOTH
THE
EXTERNAL

AND
WINGLESS
ORBITER
OPTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
DELETED
FROM

LIST
TODAYS
EDITION
OF
THE

REPORTS
THAT
OCONNOR
TOLD
THE

THAT
SOME
REDESIGN
PROPOSALS
HAVE
BEEN
DROPPED
SUCH
AS
USING
THE
GIANT
EXTERNAL
FUEL
TANKS
USED
IN
LAUNCHING
SPACE
SHUTTLES
AND
BUILDING
A
STATION
AROUND
AN
EXISTING
SPACE
SHUTTLE
WITH
ITS
WINGS
AND
TAIL
REMOVED
CURRENTLY
THERE
ARE
THREE
OPTIONS
BEING
CONSIDERED
AS
PRESENTED
TO
THE
ADVISORY
PANEL
MEETING
YESTERDAY
AND
AS
REPORTED
IN
TODAYS
TIMES
OPTION
A
LOW

MODULAR
APPROACH
THIS
OPTION
IS
BEING
STUDIED
BY
A
TEAM
FROM
MSFC
AS
AN
ASIDE
THERE
ARE
SSF
REDESIGN
TEAMS
AT
MSFC
JSC
AND
LARC
SUPPORTING
THE

REDESIGN
TEAM
IN
CRYSTAL

BOTH
LERC

ARE
ALSO
ONSITE
AT
THESE
LOCATIONS

THIS
OPTION
LOOKS
ALOT
LIKE
THE

WHICH
WE
HAVE
ALL
COME
TO
KNOW
AND
LOVE
THIS
OPTION
ASSUMES
A

SO
DOES

A
ALSO
THE
