IS
THERE
A
PLAN
TO
PUT
A
SATELLITE
AROUND
EACH
PLANET
IN
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
TO
KEEP
WATCH
I
HELP
IT
BETTER
TO
ASK
QUESTIONS
BEFORE
I
SPOUT
AN
OPINION
HOW
ABOUT
A
MISSION
UNMANNED
TO
PLUTO
TO
STAY
IN
ORBIT
AND
RECORD
THINGS
AROUND
AND
NEAR
AND
ON
PLUTO
I
KNOW
IT
IS
A
STRANGE
IDEA
BUT
WHY
NOT
IT
COULD
DO
SOME
SCANNING
OF
NOT
ONLY
PLUTO
BUT
ALSO
OF
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
OBJECTS
NEAR
AND
AAROUNDPLUTO
AS
WELL
AS
SETI
AND
LOOKING
AT
THE
GALAXY
WITHOUT
HAVING
MUCH
OF
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
DOING
THIS
IN
ANYTHING
LIKE
REASONABLE
TIME
WOULD
REQUIRE
MORE
PROPULSION
CAPABILITY
THAN
WE
CAN
MANAGE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BOOST
TO
PLUTO
AND
THEN
SLOW
BACK
DOWN
YOU
COULD
DO
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
HOHMAN
ORBIT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
WOULD
TAKE
RIDICULOUS
AMOUNTS
OF
TIME
