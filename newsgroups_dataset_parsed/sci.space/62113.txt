its
seems
a
bit
scarry
to
me
that
such
a
project
which
for
the
first
time
in
years
promisses
some
hope
in
changing
the
current
trend
in
massively
overpriced
boosting
capability
lacks
much
publicity
the
people
involved
in
it
have
been
building
hardware
rather
than
writing
press
releases
this
is
not
a
highmanpower
project
they
dont
have
spare
people
sitting
around
as
i
understand
it
there
has
also
been
some
feeling
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
project
management
that
publicity
was
not
a
good
idea
a
lot
of
people
have
been
working
on
changing
this
view
with
some
success
resembles
a
