what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
david
gives
good
explaination
of
the
deductions
from
the
isotropic
edged
distribution
to
whit
they
are
either
part
of
the
universe
or
part
of
the
oort
cloud
why
couldnt
they
be
earth
centred
with
the
edge
occuring
at
the
edge
of
the
gravisphere
i
know
there
isnt
any
mechanism
for
them
but
there
isnt
a
mechanism
for
the
others
either
what
on
earth
is
the
gravisphere
anyway
before
its
decay
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
had
a
gamma
ray
detector
as
does
ulysses
they
detect
the
brightest
bursts
that
the
earth
orbit
detectors
do
so
the
bursts
are
at
least
at
oort
cloud
distances
in
principle
four
detectors
spaced
out
by
a
few
au
would
see
parallax
if
the
bursts
are
of
solar
system
origin
the
problem
with
oort
cloud
sources
is
that
absolutely
no
plausible
mechanism
has
been
proposed
it
would
have
to
involve
new
physics
as
far
as
i
can
tell
closest
to
conventional
oort
sources
is
a
model
of
bfield
pinching
by
comets
its
got
too
many
holes
in
it
to
count
but
at
least
it
was
a
good
try

standard
disclaimer
the
laws
of
gravity
are
veryvery
strict
and
youre
just
bending
them
for
your
own
benefit
bb
alsoif
they
did
come
from
the
oort
cloud
we
would
expect
to
see
the
same
from
other
stars
oort
clouds
