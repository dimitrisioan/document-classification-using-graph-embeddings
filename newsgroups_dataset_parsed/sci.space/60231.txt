now
isnt
that
always
the
kicker
it
does
seem
stupid
to
drop
a
mission
like
magellan
because
there
isnt
million
a
year
to
keep
up
the
mission
youd
think
that
ongoing
science
could
justify
the
money
jpl
gets
accused
of
spending
more
then
neccessary
probably
some
validity
in
that
but
nasa
does
put
money
into
some
things
that
really
are
porcine
oh
well
i
attended
a
colloquium
at
goddard
last
fall
where
the
head
of
the
operations
section
of
nasa
was
talking
about
what
future
missions
were
going
to
be
funded
i
dont
remember
his
name
or
title
off
hand
and
i
have
discarded
the
colloquia
announcement
in
any
case
he
was
asked
about
that
very
matter
why
cant
we
spend
a
few
million
more
to
keep
instruments
that
we
already
have
in
place
going
his
responce
was
that
there
are
only
so
many
available
to
him
and
the
lead
time
on
an
instrument
like
a
cobe
magellan
hubble
etc
is
years
minumum
if
he
spent
all
that
could
be
spent
on
using
current
instruments
in
the
current
budget
enviroment
he
would
have
very
little
to
nothing
for
future
projects
if
he
did
that
sure
in
the
short
run
the
science
would
be
wonderful
and
he
would
be
popular
however
starting
a
few
years
after
he
had
retired
he
would
become
one
of
the
greatest
villans
ever
seen
in
the
space
community
for
not
funding
the
early
stages
of
the
next
generation
of
instruments
just
as
he
had
benefited
from
his
predicessors
funding
choices
he
owed
it
to
whoever
his
sucessor
would
eventually
be
to
keep
developing
new
missions
even
at
the
expense
of
cutting
off
some
instruments
before
the
last
drop
of
possible
science
has
been
wrung
out
of
them
