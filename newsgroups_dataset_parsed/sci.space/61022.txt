some
time
ago
i
sent
the
following
message
every
once
in
a
while
i
design
an
orbital
space
colony
im
gearing
up
to
do
another
one
id
some
info
from
you
if
you
were
to
move
onto
a
space
colony
to
live
permanently
how
big
would
the
colony
have
to
be
for
you
to
view
a
permanent
move
as
desirable
specifically
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
share
the
colony
with
what
physical
dimensions
does
the
living
are
need
to
have
assume
living
the
colony
will
rotate
assume
that
you
can
leave
from
time
to
time
for
vacations
and
business
trips
if
youre
young
enough
assume
that
youll
raise
your
children
there
i
didnt
get
a
lot
of
responses
and
they
were
all
over
the
block
thanx
muchly
to
all
those
who
responded
it
is
good
food
for
thought
heres
the
edited
responses
i
got
how
many
people
do
you
want
to
share
the
colony
with
what
physical
dimensions
does
the
living
are
need
to
have
cylinder

how

do

share
the

with
what

does
the
living
are
need
to
have
square
kms
surface
divided
into
city
towns

and
countryside
must
have
lakes
rivers
amd
mountains
how
many
people
really
isnt
that
large
a
number
everyone
will
know
everyone
else
within
the
space
of
a
year
and
will
probably
be
sick
of
everyone
else
within
another
year
what
physical
dimensions
does
the
living
are
need
to
have
hm
i
am
not
all
that
great
at
figuring
it
out
but
i
would
maximize
the
percentage
of
colonyspace
that
is
accessible
to
humans
esecially
if
there
were
to
be
children
since
they
will
figure
out
how
to
go
everywhere
anyways
and
everyone
especially
me
likes
to
go
exploringi
would
want
to
be
able
to
go
for
a
walk
and
see
something
different
each
time
for
population
i
think
i
would
want
a
substantial
town
big
enough
to
have
strangers
in
it
this
helps
get
away
from
the
smalltown
everybody
knows
everything
syndrome
which
some
people
like
but
i
dont
call
it
several
thousand
people
for
physical
dimensions
a
somewhat
similar
criterion
big
enough
to
contain
surprises
at
least
until
you
spent
considerable
time
getting
to
know
it
as
a
more
specific
rule
of
thumb
big
enough
for
there
to
be
places
at
least
an
hour
away
on
foot
call
that
which
means
a
circumference
if
were
talking
a
sphere

my
desires
for
permanent
move
to
a
space
colony
assuming
easy
communication
and
travel
size
about
a
smalltown
size
say
sq
km
course
bigger
is
better
population
about
km
or
less
so
for
less
is
better
for
elbow
room
more
for
interest
and
sanity
