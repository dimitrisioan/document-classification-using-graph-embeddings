quite
frankly
ill
believe
that
this
is
really
going
to
work
on
the
typical
trash
one
needs
to
process
when
i
see
them
put
a
couple
tons
in
one
end
and
get
relatively
clean
material
out
the
other
end
plus
be
able
to
run
it
off
its
own
residual
power
sounds
almost
like
perpetual
motion
doesnt
it
i
will
believe
that
this
process
comes
even
close
to
approaching
technological
and
economic
feasibility
given
the
mixed
nature
of
the
trash
that
will
have
to
be
run
through
it
as
opposed
to
the
costs
of
separating
things
first
and
having
a
different
run
for
each
actinide
when
i
see
them
dump
a
few
tons
in
one
end
and
pull
relatively
clean
material
out
the
other
once
the
costs
technological
risks
etc
are
taken
into
account
i
still
class
this
one
with
the
idea
of
throwing
waste
into
the
sun
sure
its
possible
and
the
physics
are
well
understood
but
is
it
really
a
reasonable
approach
how
is
it
ever
going
to
be
an
off
the
shelf
technology
if
someone
doesnt
do
it
maybe
we
should
do
this
as
part
of
the
ssf
design
goals
gee
fred
after
your
bitter
defense
of
khz
power
as
a
basic
technology
for
ssf
id
think
you
would
support
a
minor
research
program
like
this
and
does
anyone
who
knows
more
particle
physics
then
me
know
if
the
ipns
could
prove
this
technology
the
real
reason
why
accelerator
breeders
or
incinerators
are
not
being
built
is
that
there
isnt
any
reason
to
do
so
natural
uranium
is
still
too
cheap
and
geological
disposal
of
actinides
looks
technically
reasonable
it
may
also
help
there
is
political
gridlock
on
the
entire
nuclear
technical
agenda
there
were
big
political
opponenents
to
fast
breeder
technologies
wipp
is
being
fought
to
death
in
courts
even
if
you
could
make
a
nuclear
incinerator
do
you
really
think
even
deaf
smith
county
nevada
would
accept
it
nimbyism
rules
nuclear
power
concerns
only
the
medical
community
has
been
able
to
overrule
nuclear
technology
opposition
