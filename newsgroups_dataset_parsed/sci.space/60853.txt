RE
WHAT
IF
THE
USSR
HAD
REACHED
THE
MOON
FIRST
THIS
IS
TURNING
INTO
WHATS
A
MOONBASE
GOOD
FOR
AND
I
OUGHT
NOT
TO
POST
WHEN
IVE
A
HUNDRED
SOME
ODD
POSTS
TO
GO
BUT

WOULD
THINK
THAT
THE
REAL
REASON
TO
HAVE
A
MOON
BASE
IS
ECONOMIC
SINCE
SOMEONE
WITH
SPACE
INDUSTRY
WILL
PRESUMEABLY
HAVE
A
MUCH
LARGER
GNP
THAN
THEY
WOULD
WITHOUT
SPACE
INDUSTRY
EVENTUALLY
THEY
WILL
SIMPLY
BE
ABLE
TO
AFFORD
MORE
