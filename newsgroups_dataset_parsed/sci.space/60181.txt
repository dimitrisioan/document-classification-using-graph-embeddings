i
had
spacefood
sticks
just
about
every
morning
for
breakfast
in
first
and
second
grade
they
came
in
chocolate
strawberry
and
peanut
butter
and
were
cylinders
about
long
and
in
diameter
wrapped
in
yellow
space
foil
well
it
seemed
like
space
foil
at
the
time
the
taste
is
hard
to
describe
although
i
remember
it
fondly
it
was
most
certainly
more
candy
than
say
a
modern
power
bar
sort
of
a
toffee
injected
with
vitamins
the
chocolate
power
bar
is
a
rough
approximation
of
the
taste
