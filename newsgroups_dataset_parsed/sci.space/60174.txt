THIS
BIT
INTERESTS
ME
HOW
MUCH
AUTOMATIC
CONTROL
IS
THERE
IS
IT
PURELY
AUTONOMOUS
OR
IS
THERE
SOME
DEGREE
OF
GROUND
CONTROL
THE
STICKANDRUDDER
MAN
IS
ALWAYS
THE
ONBOARD
COMPUTER
THE
COMPUTER
NORMALLY
GETS
ITS
ORDERS
FROM
A
STORED
PROGRAM
BUT
THEY
CAN
BE
OVERRIDDEN
FROM
THE
GROUND
HOW
IS
THE
TRANSITION
FROM
AERODYNAMIC
FLIGHT
IF
THATS
WHAT
IT
IS
TO
HOVER
ACCOMPLISHED
THIS
IS
THE
REALLY
NEW
PART
ITS
ALSO
ONE
OF
THE
TRICKY
PARTS
THERE
ARE
FOUR
DIFFERENT
IDEAS
AND
DCX
WILL
PROBABLY
END
UP
TRYING
ALL
OF
THEM
THIS
IS
FROM
TALKING
TO
MITCH
BURNSIDE
CLAPP
WHOS
ONE
OF
THE
DCX
TEST
PILOTS
AT
MAKING
ORBIT
POP
A
DROGUE
CHUTE
FROM
THE
NOSE
LIGHT
THE
ENGINES
ONCE
THE
THING
STABILIZES
BASEFIRST
SIMPLE
AND
RELIABLE
HEAVY
SHOCK
LOADS
ON
AN
AREA
OF
STRUCTURE
THAT
DOESNT
OTHERWISE
CARRY
MAJOR
LOADS
NEEDS
A
DOOR
IN
THE
HOT
PART
OF
THE
STRUCTURE
A
DOOR
WHOSE
OPERATION
IS
MISSIONCRITICAL
SWITCH
OFF
PITCH
STABILITY
THE
DC
IS
AERODYNAMICALLY
UNSTABLE
AT
SUBSONIC
SPEEDS
WAIT
FOR
IT
TO
FLIP
AND
CATCH
IT
AT
DEGREES
THEN
LIGHT
ENGINES
A
BIT
SCARY
LIGHT
THE
ENGINES
AND
USE
THRUST
VECTORING
TO
PUSH
THE
TAIL
AROUND
PROBABLY
THE
PREFERRED
METHOD
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
TRICKY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FUELFEED
PLUMBING
THE
FUEL
WILL
START
OFF
IN
THE
TOPS
OF
THE
TANKS
THEN
SLOP
DOWN
TO
THE
BOTTOMS
DURING
THE
FLIP
KEEPING
THE
ENGINES
PROPERLY
FED
WILL
BE
COMPLICATED
BUILD
UP
SPEED
IN
A
DIVE
THEN
PULL
UP
HARD
LOSING
A
LOT
OF
SPEED
THIS
THINGS
LD
IS
NOT
THAT
GREAT
UNTIL
ITS
HEADED
UP
AND
THE
VERTICAL
VELOCITY
DROPS
TO
ZERO
AT
WHICH
POINT
IT
STARTS
TO
FALL
TAILFIRST
LIGHT
ENGINES
ALSO
A
BIT
SCARY
AND
YOU
PROBABLY
DONT
HAVE
ENOUGH
ALTITUDE
LEFT
TO
TRY
AGAIN
ALL
WORK
IS
ONE
MANS
WORK

U
OF

ZOOLOGY
KIPLING
HENRYZOOTORONTOEDU
UTZOOHENRY
SINCE
THE
DCX
IS
TO
TAKE
OFF
HORIZONTAL
WHY
NOT
LAND
THAT
WAY
WHY
DO
THE
MARTIAN
LANDING
THING
OR
AM
I
MISSING
SOMETHING
DONT
KNOW
TO
MUCH
ABOUT
DCX
AND
SUCH
OVERLY
OBVIOUS
WHY
NOT
JUST
FALL
TO
EARTH
LIKE
THE
RUSSIAN
CRAFTS
PARACHUTE
IN
THEN
MICHAEL
ADAMS
IM
NOT
HIGH
JUST
JACKED
PLEASE
ENLIGHTEN
ME
IGNORANCE
IS
EASY
TO
CORRECT
MAKE
A
MISTAKE
AND
EVERYONE
WILL
LET
YOU
KNOW
YOU
MESSED
UP
