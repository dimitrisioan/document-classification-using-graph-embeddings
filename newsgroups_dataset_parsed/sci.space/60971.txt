whats

in
my
opinion
friday

washington
dc
space
billboards
is
this
one
the
spinoffs
we
were
promised
in
science
fiction
writer
robert
heinlein
published
the
man
who
sold
the
moon
which
involved
a
dispute
over
the
sale
of
rights
to
the
moon
for
use
as
billboard
nasa
has
taken
the
firsteps
toward
this
hideous
vision
of
the
future
observers
were
startled
this
spring
when
a
nasa
launch
vehicle
arrived
at
the
pad
with
schwarzenegger
painted
in
huge
block
letters
on
the
side
of
the
booster
rockets
space
marketing
inc
had
arranged
for
the
ad
to
promote
arnolds
latest
movie
now
space
marketing
is
working
with
university
of
colorado
and
livermore
engineers
on
a
plan
to
place
a
milelong
inflatable
billboard
in
lowearth
orbit
nasa
would
provide
contractual
launch
services
however
since
nasa
bases
its
charge
on
seriously
flawed
cost
estimates
wn
mar
the
taxpayers
would
bear
most
of
the
expense
this
may
look
like
environmental
vandalism
but
mike
lawson
ceo
of
space
marketing
told
us
yesterday
that
the
real
purpose
of
the
project
is
to
help
the
environment
the
platform
will
carry
ozone
monitors
he
explainedadvertising
is
just
to
help
defray
costs

think
of
this
revolting
and
hideous
attempt
to
vandalize
the
night
sky

is
not

what
about
light
pollution
in
observations
i
read
somewhere
else

might
even
be
visible
during
the
day
leave
alone
at
night

nasa
