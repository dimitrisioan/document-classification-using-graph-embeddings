you
may
want
to
put
hubble
back
in
the
payload
bay
for
a
reboost
and
you
dont
want
to
clip
off
the
panels
each
time
the
artist
renderings
that
ive
seen
of
the
hst
reboost
still
have
the
arrays
fully
extended
with
a
cradle
holding
hst
at
a
degree
angle
to
the
shuttle
i
think
the
rendering
was
conceived
before
the
array
replacemnet
was
approved
so
im
not
sure
if
the
current
reboost
will
occur
with
the
arrays
deployed
or
not
however
it
doesnt
appear
that
an
array
retraction
was
necessary
for
reboost
for
the
gammaray
observatory
one
of
the
design
requirements
was
that
there
be
no
storedenergy
mecahnisms
springs
explosive
squibs
gas
shocks
etc
used
for
deployment
this
was
partially
so
that
everything
could
be
reeled
back
in
to
put
it
back
in
the
payload
bay
and
partially
for
safety
considerations
ive
heard
that
the
wings
on
a
cruise
missile
would
cut
you
in
half
if
you
were
standing
in
their
swath
when
they
opened
thanks
for
the
input
on
gros
sa
design
constraints
that
would
explain
the
similar
design
on
uars
back
when
the
shuttle
would
be
going
up
every
other
day
with
a
cost
to
orbit
of
per
pound
everybody
designed
things
for
easy
servicing
heck
the
mms
project
used
to
design
missions
with
servicing
in
mind
the
xte
spacecraft
was
originally
designed
as
an
onorbit
replacement
for
the
instrument
module
on
euve
that
way
you
get
two
instruments
for
the
price
of
one
spacecraft
bus
the
explorer
platform
a
second
onorbit
replacement
was
also
considered
with
the
fuse
telescope
