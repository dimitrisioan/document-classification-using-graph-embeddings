A

EXTERNAL

AND

WOULD
BE

THE

WHY
JETTISON
THE
SSMES
WHY
NOT
HOLD
ON
TO
THEM
AND
HAVE
A
SHUTTLE
BRING
THEM
DOWN
TO
USE
AS
SPARES
ONE

REASON
COMES
TO

IF
YOU
JETTISON
THE
SSMES
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
DRAG
THEM
WITH
YOU
WHEN
YOU
PERFORM
YOUR
CIRCULARIZATION

ONORBIT
SSMES
ARE
JUST
DEAD
WEIGHT
SINCE
WE
DONT
HAVE
AN

PRESSURIZATION
MECHANISM
WHICH
WORKS
IN
ZEROG
THIS
MEANS
THAT
YOU
CANT
USE
THEM
FOR
REBOOST
OR
ANYTHING
ELSE
DEAD
WEIGHT
HAS
A
COUPLE
OF
ADVANTAGES
BUT
MORE
DISADVANTAGES
THROWAWAY
SSMES
MIGHT
LET
US
USE
SOME
OF
THE
OLD
SSMES
WHICH
ARE
NOT
QUITEMANRATABLE
BUT
I
DOUBT
WED
DO
THAT
THE
COST
OF
