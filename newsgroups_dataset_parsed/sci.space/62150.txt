KEN
HAYASHIDA
WRITES
WELL
SPENZWHAT
CAN
I
SAY
YOUVE
ATTACKED
MY
BELOVED
VEHICLE
IF
I
MAY
OFFER
A
CONSTRUCTIVE
CRITICISM
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULD
DECIDE
IF
YOU
LOVE
VEHICLES
OR
THE
USE
THEY
ARE
PUT
TO
I
MYSELF
THINK
THE
IS
A
BEAUTIFUL
AIRCRAFT
BUT
REST
ASSURED
I
WOULDNT
EVEN
THINK
OF
FLYING
IT
IN
COMBAT
TODAY
MOST
OF
US
WANT
ACCESS
TO
SPACE
AND
JUDGE
VEHICLES
ON
HOW
THEY
PERFORM
WE
SEE
ZERODEFECTS
OPERATION
IN
MANY
AREAS
OF
LIFE
NOT
TO
THIS
DEGREE
CALLING
SHUTTLE
FLIGHT
CHARACTERISTICS
BIZARRE
IN
THE
SAME
POST
AS
TOUTING
DCX
IS
INTERESTING
WHY
DCX
WILL
ALSO
HAVE
SIMILAR
ZERODEFECTS
ISSUES
AM
I
WRONG
YOUR
WRONG
THE
DC
APPROACH
IS
VERY
TOLLERENT
OF
FAILURE
IT
ALSO
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
FAR
GREATER
RELIABILITY
DO
TO
ITS
REUSABLE
NATURE
SHUTTLE
ISNT
REUSABLE
ITS
SALVAGABLE
I
AM
THINKING
OF
HOW
DCX
WILL
DEPLOY
A
CHUTE
OR
REVERSE
ORIENTATION
AT
SUPERSONIC
SPEEDS
THE
FLIP
OVER
HAPPENS
AT
A
VERY
LOW
SPEED
NOT
SUPERSONIC
IF
THE
DCX
SHOWS
THE
FLIP
OVER
WORKS
IT
WILL
WORK
UNLESS
THE
LAWS
OF
PHYSICS
CHANGE
HOW
MUCH
IN
DCX
IS
REDUNDANT
THATS
THE
REAL
QUESTION
THE
FINAL
WILL
HAVE
FULLY
INTACT
ABORT
THROUGHOUT
THE
ENTIRE
FLIGHT
ENVELOP
UPON
REENTRY
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
CAN
LOOSE
ABOUT
OF
AVAILABLE
THRUST
AND
STILL
LAND
SAFELY
EVERYTHING
WE
DO
IN
LIFE
HAS
ZERODEFECTS
ISSUES
AT
TIMES
AGREE
EVERYTHING
CAN
SUFFER
FROM
CATASTROPHIC
FAILURE
BUT
THATS
NOT
THE
SAME
THING
SHUTTLE
SIMPLY
ISNT
A
FAULT
TOLERENT
DESIGN
SSTO
IS
AS
A
DOCTOR
I
CAN
NOT
ERROR
IN
MY
DIAGNOSIS
AND
TREATMENT
RECOMMENDATIONS
YOU
DONT
PUT
YOUR
PATIENTS
IN
CONDITIONS
WHERE
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OUT
YOU
WOULDNT
FOR
EXAMPLE
GIVE
A
PATIENT
A
DRUG
AND
NOT
MONITOR
THEM
FOR
HARMFUL
SIDE
EFFECTS
WOULD
YOU
WHILE
DCXS
RD
PROGRAM
MAKES
GOOD
SENSE
I
AM
LESS
OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT
DCX
AS
YOU
AND
APPARENTLY
OTHERS
ARE
YOU
ARE
VERY
MUCH
IN
THE
MINORITY
IF
THE
DC
SERIES
FAILS
TO
MAKE
ORBIT
IT
WILL
STILL
BE
A
VERY
WORTHWHILE
EFFORT
IT
WILL
SHOW
US
EXACTLY
WHAT
WE
DO
NEED
TO
DO
TO
BUILD
SSTO
BUT
DCX
WILL
STILL
HAVE
FAILURES
IT
IS
THE
NATURE
OF
AEROSPACE
RD
AGAIN
REFERING
TO
THE
IT
WILL
PROVIDE
FULLY
INTACT
ABORT
THEROUGHOUT
THE
FLIGHT
ENVELOP
SHUTTLE
DOESNT
DC
IS
FAULT
TOLLERENT
SHUTTLE
ISNT
ITS
SUCCESSORS
ARE
NOT
SLATED
TO
BE
PASSENGER
CARRYING
NOT
TRUE
BUILD
A
PASSENGER
PALLET
A
FAIRLY
EASY
THING
TO
DO
AND
IT
WILL
CARRY
PASSENGERS
THE
IMPRESSION
I
HAD
WHEN
I
VISITED
MACDAC
HUNTINGTON
BEACHS
OPEN
HOUSE
WAS
THAT
THE
PAYLOAD
SPACE
WAS
LIMITED
AND
THE
MANRATABLE
VERSION
WAS
DECADES
AWAY
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
YOU
TALK
TO
THE
DCX
CREW
THEMSELVES
THEIR
ORIGINAL
SCHEDULE
HAD
AN
OPERATIONAL
FLYING
IN
SHUTTLE
IS
THE
ONLY
METHOD
IN
THE
FREE
WORLD
OF
ORBITING
LARGE
LIFE
SCIENCES
AND
MEDICAL
RELATED
PACKAGES
AS
FOR
NOW
IT
IS
OUR
ONLY
TICKET
INTO
SPACE
AND
HAS
MY
SUPPORT
YOUR
IGNORING
THE
DAMMAGE
IT
DOES
MANNES
SPACE
HAS
A
REPUTATION
FOR
BEING
UNRELIABLE
AND
HUGELY
EXPENSIVE
SHUTTLE
SUPPORTERS
ONLY
MAKE
IT
EASY
FOR
OPPONENTS
OF
MANNED
SPACE
TO
KILL
IT
YOU
COULD
CHANGE
MY
VIEW
ON
DCX
IF
YOU
COULD
PROVE
THE
FOLLOWING
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
PROVE
THOSE
THINGS
IS
TO
BUILD
IT
ALLEN
LADY
ASTOR
SIR
IF
YOU
WERE
MY
HUSBAND
I
WOULD
POISON
YOUR
COFFEE
W
CHURCHILL
MADAM
IF
YOU
WERE
MY
WIFE
I
WOULD
DRINK
IT
DAYS
TO
FIRST
FLIGHT
OF
DCX
