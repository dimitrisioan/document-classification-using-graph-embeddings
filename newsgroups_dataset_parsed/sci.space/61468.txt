WRITES
IM
WONDERING
IF
VANDALIZE
IS
THE
PROPER
WORD
TO
USE
IN
THIS
SITUATION
MY
DICTIONARY
DEFINES
VANDALISM
AS
THE
WILLFUL
OR
MALICIOUS
DESTRUCTUION
OF
PUBLIC
OR
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
ESPECIALLY
OF
ANYTHING
BEAUTIFUL
OR
ARTISITC
I
WOULD
AGREE
THE
SKY
IS
BEAUTIFUL
BUT
NOT
THAT
IT
IS
PUBLIC
OR
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
ITS
PUBLIC
BECAUSE
IT
BELONGS
TO
EVERYBODY
ITS
VANDALISM
BECAUSE
MANY
PEOPLE
POWER
COMPANIES
DO
MALICIOUSLY
WASTE
LIGHT
IF
THEY
CAN
SELL
YOU
OR
YOUR
CITY
OR
YOUR
STATE
AN
UNSHIELDED
LIGHT
THAT
WASTES
TO
PERCENT
OF
ITS
LIGHT
THEY
MAKE
MORE
MONEY
NEVER
MIND
THAT
YOUR
MONEY
IS
WASTED
NEVER
MIND
THAT
TAXPAPERS
MONEY
IS
WASTED
NEVER
MIND
THAT
THE
SKY
IS
RUINED
