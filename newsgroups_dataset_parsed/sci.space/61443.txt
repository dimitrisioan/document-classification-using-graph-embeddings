RE
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTERS
WHERE
ARE
THEY
I
FEEL
COMPELLED
TO
COMPLAIN
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
RECENT
OBSERVATIONS
RULE
OUT
MERGING
NEUTRON
STARS
AS
SOURCES
OF
GAMMARAY
BURSTS
IS
UTTERLY
FALSE
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
IS
POPULAR
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
IT
TO
BATSE
PRESS
RELEASES
THE
IDEA
BEHIND
THE
STATEMENT
IS
AS
FOLLOWS
IF
YOU
SMACK
TWO
NEUTRON
STARS
TOGETHER
OR
HAVE
A
NEUTRON
STAR
BE
GOBBLED
UP
BY
A
BLACK
HOLE
A
LOT
OF
ENERGY
IS
RELEASED
ENOUGH
FOR
A
GAMMARAY
BURST
AT
A
COSMOLOGICAL
DISTANCE
BUT
SO
THE
REASONING
CONTINUES
THIS
ENERGY
IS
RELEASED
BELOW
A
LOT
OF
MATTER
SO
THE
RADIATION
BECOMES
THERMALIZED
AND
YOU
EXPECT
TO
SEE
ROUGHLY
A
BLACKBODY
SPECTRUM
THE
OBSERVED
SPECTRA
ARE
STRONGLY
NONTHERMAL
SO
THIS
MODEL
MUST
BE
WRONG
AS
SO
OFTEN
THE
FAULT
LIES
WITH
THE
IMAGINATION
OF
THE
PERSON
WHO
WAS
TRYING
TO
PROVE
THE
MODEL
WRONG
RATHER
THAN
WITH
THE
MODEL
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THE
INITIAL
ENERGY
RELEASE
IS
NOT
SEEN
AS
A
GAMMARAY
BURST
BUT
THE
FIREBALL
OF
ENERGY
AND
MATTER
THAT
IS
CREATED
MAY
SPEW
OUT
A
RELATIVISTIC
FLOW
WHEN
THIS
SLAMS
INTO
THE
SURROUNDING
MEDIUM
A
STRONG
FLUX
OF
NONTHERMAL
GAMMA
RAYS
RESULTS
WHICH
MAY
CARRY
OFF
A
SUBSTANTIAL
FRACTION
OF
THE
INITIAL
TOTAL
ENERGY
ALL
THIS
IS
NOT
MY
IDEA
IT
IS
IN
A
SERIES
OF
PAPERS
BY
MARTIN
REES
PETER
MESZAROS
SORRY
FOR
THE
MISSING
ACCENTS
AND
COWORKERS
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
A
COMPLETE
MODEL
BUT
IT
MAY
WELL
BE
THE
BEST
ONE
AROUND
SUMMING
OVER
ALL
PROPOSED
DISTANCE
SCALES
AN
ALTERNATIVE
PROPOSAL
FOR
WHAT
CREATES
THE
INITIAL
FIREBALL
BY
THE
WAY
IS
THE
SOCALLED
FAILED
SUPERNOVAE
SCENARIO
BY
STAN
WOOSLEY
IN
WHICH
A
VERY
MASSIVE
STAR
AT
THE
END
OF
ITS
LIFE
COLLAPSES
TO
A
BLACK
HOLE
IF
THE
STELLAR
CORE
WAS
ROTATING
PART
OF
THE
INFALLING
MATTER
WILL
BE
TEMPORARILY
HALTED
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
CENTRIFUGAL
FORCE
AND
FORM
A
VERY
DENSE
NEUTRON
TORUS
THAT
ACCRETES
ONTO
THE
BLACK
HOLE
THIS
BEAST
MAY
SPEW
OUT
A
JET
ALONG
THE
ROTATION
AXIS
WHICH
AGAIN
CONSTITUTES
RELATIVISTIC
FLOW
THE
RATE
OF
SUCH
EVENTS
MAY
BE
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
THAT
OF
NEUTRON
STAR
MERGERS
BUT
THE
FLUX
MAY
BE
MORE
STRONGLY
BEAMED
SO
THAT
THE
NET
RATE
OF
BURSTS
OBSERVED
ON
EARTH
STAYS
THE
SAME
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
SCENARIOS
BUT
THE
ENERGY
RELEASED
PER
EVENT
CAN
BE
A
LOT
LESS
IN
THE
FAILED
SUPERNOVA
SCENARIO
ON
ANOTHER
NOTE
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
DISTANCE
SCALE
MUST
ULTIMATELY
BE
RESOLVED
VIA
SOME
CLASSICAL
ASTRONOMICAL
METHOD
SUCH
AS
FINDING
COUNTERPARTS
TO
THE
BURSTS
AT
OTHER
WAVELENGTHS
OR
FINDING
A
DEFINITIVE
SIGNATURE
OF
SOME
KNOWN
CLASS
OF
OBJECTS
IN
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
POSITIONS
AND
FLUXES
THEORISTS
HAVE
HISTORICALLY
NOT
BEEN
TOO
SUCCESSFULL
IN
FINDING
THE
DISTANCE
OF
ANY
OBJECT
BY
PROVING
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
POSSIBLE
WAY
IN
WHICH
THE
OBJECT
CAN
WORK
AND
THEREFORE
IT
MUST
BE
