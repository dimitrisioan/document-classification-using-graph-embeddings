i
would
appreciate
any
thoughts
on
what
makes
a
planet
habitable
for
humans
i
am
making
asumptions
that
life
and
a
similar
atmosphere
evolve
given
a
range
of
physical
aspects
of
the
planet
the
question
is
what
physical
aspects
simply
disallow
earth
like
conditions
eg
temperature
range
of
to
where
temp
is
purely
dependant
on
dist
from
the
sun
and
the
suns
temperature
atmospheric
presure
i
know
nothing
of
human
tolerance
planetary
mass
again
gravity
at
surface
is
important
how
much
can
human
bodies
take
day
after
day
also
how
does
the
mass
effect
atmosphere
i
thinking
of
planets
between
and
times
mass
of
the
earth
i
suppose
density
should
be
important
as
well
climate
etc
does
not
concern
me
nor
does
axial
tilt
etc
etc
just
the
above
three
factors
and
how
they
relate
to
one
another

interesting
questions
some
wonder
whether
or
not
the
moon
could
have
ever
supported
an
atmosphere
id
be
interested
in
knowing
what
our
geologyenvironmental
sciences
friends
think
as
for
human
tolerances
the
best
example
of
human
endurance
in
terms
of
altitude
ie
low
atmospheric
pressure
and
lower
oxygen
partial
pressure
is
in
my
opinion
to
the
scaling
of
mt
everest
without
oxygen
assistance
this
was
accomplished
by
a
team
of
mountaineers
who
trained
at
high
altitudes
for
quite
awhile
i
think
a
few
months
and
then
were
flown
by
helicopter
from
that
training
altitude
to
the
equivalent
altitude
on
mount
everest
where
they
began
the
ascent
of
our
planets
highest
peak
without
oxygen
tanks
this
is
quite
a
feat
of
physiological
endurance
because
if
you
or
i
tried
to
go
to
feet
and
exert
ourselves
we
would
probably
pass
out
get
altitude
sick
and
could
even
die
from
cerebral
edema
so
this
is
the
limit
of
low
pressure
high
pressure
situations
would
be
limited
by
the
duration
of
time
which
it
takes
to
slowly
acclimate
to
a
higher
pressure
skin
divers
would
know
alot
about
high
pressure
situations
and
could
tell
you
about
how
they
safely
make
deep
dives
without
getting
the
bends
some
military
experiments
have
put
people
under
several
atmospheres
of
pressure
not
sure
what
the
high
limit
was
because
the
papers
arent
in
front
of
me
usually
at
a
certain
point
the
nitrogen
in
the
air
becomes
toxic
to
the
body
and
you
start
acting
idiotic
divers
call
this
nitrogen
narcosis
those
afflicted
can
do
very
dangerous
and
irrational
things
like
taking
off
a
diving
mask
and
oxygen
tank
in
order
to
talk
to
fish
at
feet
under
water
hope
any
diving
folk
can
elaborate
on
this
matter
as
i
am
not
a
diving
expert
mars
cannot
support
human
life
without
pressurization
because
the
atmosphere
is
too
thin
th
our
earths
atmospheric
density
in
addition
the
mars
atmosphere
is
mostly
carbon
dioxide
basically
you
would
need
a
pressure
suit
there
or
youd
die
from
the
low
pressure
interesting
