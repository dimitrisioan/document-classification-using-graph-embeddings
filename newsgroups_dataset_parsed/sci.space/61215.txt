RE
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTERS
WHERE
ARE
THEY
IN
ARTICLE
PRBACCESSDIGEXCOM
PAT
WRITES
WHAT
EVIDENCE
INDICATES
THAT
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTERS
ARE
VERY
FAR
AWAY
THEIR
DISTRIBUTION
IS
VERY
ISOTROPIC
AND
THE
INTENSITY
DISTRIBUTION
CRUDELY
SPEAKING
INDICATES
WERE
SEEING
AN
EDGE
TO
THE
DISTRIBUTION
GIVEN
THE
ENORMOUS
POWER
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
WHAT
IF
THEY
ARE
QUANTUM
BLACK
HOLES
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
FAIRLY
CLOSE
BY
WHY
WOULD
THEY
HAVE
TO
BE
AT
GALACTIC
RANGES
NOW
IN
THE
GOOD
OLD
DAYS
BEFORE
GRO
DATA
IT
WAS
THOUGHT
THE
GAMMA
BURSTERS
WERE
NEUTRON
STARS
IN
THE
GALAXY
IT
WAS
EXPECTED
THAT
GRO
WOULD
CONFIRM
THIS
BY
EITHER
SHOWING
THEY
WERE
A
LOCAL
POPULATION
WITHIN
A
FEW
HUNDRED
LIGHT
YEARS
OR
THAT
THEY
WERE
IN
THE
GALACTIC
HALO
MECHANISM
WAS
NOT
KNOWN
BUT
SEVERAL
PLAUSIBLE
ONES
EXISTED
ALSO
TO
BE
FAIR
IT
WAS
NOTED
THAT
THE
BRIGHTEST
BURSTER
WAS
PROBABLY
IN
THE
LMC
SUGGESTING
THEORISTS
MIGHT
BE
WRONG
BACK
THEN
AS
THE
SUN
IS
NOT
AT
THE
CENTER
OF
THE
GALAXY
A
HALO
POPULATION
SHOULD
SHOW
ANISOTROPY
A
LOCAL
DISK
POPULATION
IS
RULED
OUT
COMPLETELY
AT
THIS
STAGE
TO
AVOID
THE
ANISOTROPY
YOU
HAVE
TO
PUSH
THE
HALO
OUT
THE
ENERGY
THEN
GETS
LARGE
THE
MECHANISM
OF
GETTING
NS
OUT
THAT
FAR
BECOMES
QUESTIONABLE
AND
WE
SHOULD
START
TO
SEE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
ANDROMEDAS
BURSTERS
THE
DATA
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
EITHER
A
OORT
CLOUD
DISTRIBUTION
BUT
ONLY
JUST
BUT
NO
ONE
CAN
THINK
OF
A
PLAUSIBLE
SOURCE
WITH
THE
RIGHT
SPECTRUM
OR
IT
CAN
BE
A
COSMOLOGICAL
DISTANCES
HENCE
ISOTROPY
AND
THE
EDGE
IS
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
IF
AT
COSMOLOGICAL
DISTANCES
YOU
NEED
VERY
HIGH
ENERGY
TO
DETECT
AND
A
VERY
COMPACT
SOURCE
FOR
SPECTRUM
ERGO
A
NEUTRON
STAR
COLLIDING
WITH
ANOTHER
NEUTRON
STAR
OR
BLACK
HOLE
EVEN
THEN
GETTING
THE
SPECTRUM
IS
VERY
HARD
BUT
CONCEIVABLE
IF
WE
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
PHYSICS
AT
THAT
LEVEL
THE
BURSTERS
ARE
NOT
DUE
TO
QUANTUM
BLACK
HOLES
OR
COSMIC
STRINGS
WRONG
SPECTRUM
FOR
ONE
THING
THE
SITUATION
IS
FURTHER
COMPLICATED
BY
RECENT
CLAIMS
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
CLASSES
OF
SOURCES
IN
THE
COLLIDING
NS
THEYD
ACTUALLY
PROBABLY
FIT
RELATIVELY
EASILY
INTO
THE
NSNS
AND
NSBH
COLLISION
SCENARIOS
RESPECTIVELY
MY
OWN
PET
THEORY
IS
THAT
ITS
FLYING
SAUCERS
ENTERING
HYPERSPACE
BUT
THE
REASON
I
AM
ASKING
IS
THAT
MOST
EVERYONE
ASSUMES
THAT
THEY
ARE
COLLIDING
NUETRON
STARS
OR
SPINNING
BLACK
HOLES
I
JUST
WONDERED
IF
ANY
MECHANISM
COULD
EXIST
AND
PLACE
THEM
CLOSER
IN
IF
YOU
CAN
THINK
OF
ONE
REMEMBER
