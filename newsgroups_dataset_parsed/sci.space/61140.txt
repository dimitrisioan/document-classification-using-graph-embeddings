april
sirtf
is
still
very
much
in
business
by
mark
whalen
in
these
times
of
extratight
nasa
budgets
the
very
survival
of
a
number
of
missions
has
been
uncertain
but
thanks
to
major
design
refinements
implemented
in
recent
months
jpls
space
infrared
telescope
facility
sirtf
a
major
project
considered
to
be
in
trouble
a
couple
of
years
ago
is
alive
and
well
according
to
project
scientist
michael
werner
a
lighter
spacecraft
revised
orbit
and
shorter
mission
have
added
up
to
a
less
expensive
project
with
tremendous
scientific
power
and
a
bright
future
said
werner
designed
as
a
followup
to
the
highly
successful
infrared
astronomical
satellite
iras
and
cosmic
background
explorer
cobe
missions
sirtf
a
cryogenically
cooled
observatory
for
infrared
astronomy
from
space
is
scheduled
for
launch
in
or
if
plans
proceed
as
scheduled
iras
pioneering
work
in
spacebased
infrared
astronomy
years
ago
allowed
astronomers
to
view
the
milky
way
as
never
before
and
revealed
among
other
things
galaxies
and
comets
it
provided
a
sky
survey
times
more
sensitive
than
any
previously
available
from
groundbased
observations
cobe
has
measured
the
infrared
and
microwave
background
radiation
on
large
angular
scales
and
revealed
new
facts
about
the
early
universe
but
to
illuminate
sirtfs
potential
jim
evans
jpls
manager
of
astrophysics
and
fundamental
physics
preprojects
recently
said
that
the
project
is
to
million
times
more
capable
than
iras
based
on
technological
advances
in
infrared
detector
arrays
however
despite
the
enormous
strides
in
infrared
exploration
sirtf
promised
and
the
fact
that
it
was
cited
as
the
highest
priority
new
initiative
for
all
of
astronomy
in
the
by
the
national
academy
of
sciences
it
took
a
diet
or
die
directive
from
nasa
headquarters
last
year
to
keep
the
project
going
according
to
werner
the
project
is
now
known
as
atlas
sirtf
based
on
the
key
factor
in
its
new
design
the
satellite
will
orbit
the
sun
instead
of
the
earth
permitting
the
use
of
an
atlas
rocket
launch
instead
of
the
formerly
proposed
and
heavier
titan
the
main
advantage
of
the
solar
orbit
is
that
you
can
use
all
of
your
launch
capability
for
boosting
the
payload
you
dont
have
to
carry
up
a
second
rocket
to
circularize
the
orbit
werner
said
the
other
advantage
to
a
solar
orbit
he
said
is
that
its
in
a
better
thermal
environment
away
from
the
heat
of
the
earth
additional
major
changes
in
sirtfs
redesign
include
shortening
the
mission
from
five
to
three
years
and
building
a
spacecraft
that
is
less
than
half
as
heavy
as
in
the
original
plan
atlas
sirtf
will
weigh
kilograms
pounds
compared
to
titan
sirtfs
kilograms
pounds
all
of
that
adds
up
to
a
less
stressful
launch
environment
werner
said
and
a
cost
savings
of
more
than
million
for
the
launch
in
addition
to
increased
savings
in
the
design
of
the
smaller
less
massive
spacecraft
werner
said
sirtfs
redesign
came
as
a
result
of
congress
telling
nasa
youre
trying
to
do
too
many
things
if
you
want
us
to
support
sirtf
which
is
a
good
project
develop
a
plan
to
see
how
it
fits
into
nasas
overall
strategy
shortly
thereafter
sirtf
was
named
as
nasas
highest
priority
flagship
scientific
mission
by
the
interdisciplinary
space
sciences
advisory
committee
in
addition
to
the
blessing
from
the
national
academy
of
sciences
while
the
spacecraft
and
its
instruments
required
descoping
to
keep
the
project
alive
sirtfs
major
scientific
contribution
always
promised
to
come
about
from
its
advanced
infrared
detector
arrays
which
will
allow
images
to
be
developed
tens
of
thousands
of
times
faster
than
before
according
to
evans
up
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
werner
said
all
infrared
astronomy
was
done
with
single
detectors
or
very
small
arrays
of
individually
assembled
detectors
since
then
the
department
of
defense
has
developed
a
program
to
produce
arrays
of
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
detectors
rather
than
just
a
few
and
those
are
very
well
suited
for
use
on
sirtf
werner
noted
that
in
addition
to
dealing
with
budget
pressures
congress
is
currently
watching
nasa
projects
with
an
eye
out
for
any
technological
spinoff
on
that
question
i
think
we
have
some
things
to
say
he
said
because
the
detectors
were
using
are
straight
off
various
military
developments
also
sirtf
will
be
built
by
the
us
aerospace
industry
and
its
a
real
technological
and
engineering
challenge
in
addition
to
being
a
tremendous
scientific
project
sirtf
will
be
used
by
the
entire
astronomical
community
werner
added
but
the
revised
threeyear
mission
puts
a
premium
on
observing
time
we
have
to
educate
the
user
community
and
develop
a
program
that
involves
early
surveys
and
quick
turnaround
of
the
data
werner
said
the
downsizing
of
the
project
required
a
reduction
in
scope
and
complexity
of
sirtfs
three
instruments
the
infrared
spectrograph
infrared
array
camera
and
multiband
imaging
photometer
however
these
reductions
will
only
result
in
losses
of
efficiency
rather
than
capability
he
said
the
project
hopes
to
start
a
phase
b
activity
in
which
will
provide
a
detailed
concept
for
development
and
design
building
the
hardware
would
begin
about
two
years
later
projected
cost
estimates
evans
said
are
million
i
am
very
optimistic
about
sirtf
he
said
it
will
provide
a
tremendous
return
for
the
investment
werner
added
that
an
additional
benefit
from
the
project
will
be
the
enrichment
of
our
intellectual
and
cultural
environment
people
on
the
street
are
very
interested
in
astronomy
black
holes
the
possibility
of
life
on
other
planets
the
origin
of
the
universe
and
those
are
the
kind
of
questions
sirtf
will
help
answer
