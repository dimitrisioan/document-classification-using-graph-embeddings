SIRTF
IS

IN

NASA
BUDGETS
THE
VERY
SURVIVAL
OF
A
NUMBER
OF

HAS
BEEN
UNCERTAIN
BUT
THANKS
TO
MAJOR

FACILITY
SIRTF
A
MAJOR
PROJECT
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
IN

A
COUPLE
OF

AND

ACCORDING
TO

ADDED
UP
TO
A

PROJECT
WITH
TREMENDOUS
SCIENTIFIC
POWER
AND
A
BRIGHT
FUTURE
SAID

NEVER

ON

POTENTIAL
JIM
EVANS
JPLS
MANAGER
OF
ASTROPHYSICS
AND
FUNDAMENTAL
PHYSICS
PREPROJECTS
RECENTLY
SAID
THAT
THE
PROJECT
IS
TO
MILLION
TIMES
MORE
CAPABLE
THAN
IRAS
BASED
ON
TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCES
IN
INFRARED
DETECTOR
ARRAYS
HOWEVER
DESPITE
THE
ENORMOUS
STRIDES
IN
INFRARED
EXPLORATION
SIRTF
PROMISED
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
WAS
CITED
AS
THE
HIGHEST
PRIORITY
NEW
INITIATIVE
FOR
ALL
OF
ASTRONOMY
IN
THE
BY
THE
NATIONAL
ACADEMY
OF
SCIENCES
IT
TOOK
A
DIET
OR
DIE
DIRECTIVE
FROM
NASA
HEADQUARTERS
LAST
YEAR
TO
KEEP
THE
PROJECT
GOING
ACCORDING
TO
WERNER
THE
PROJECT
IS
NOW
KNOWN
AS
ATLAS
SIRTF
BASED
ON
THE
KEY
FACTOR
IN
ITS
NEW
DESIGN
THE
SATELLITE
WILL
ORBIT
THE
SUN
INSTEAD
OF
THE
EARTH
PERMITTING
THE
USE
OF
AN
ATLAS
ROCKET
LAUNCH
INSTEAD
OF
THE
FORMERLY
PROPOSED
AND
HEAVIER
TITAN
THE
MAIN
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
SOLAR
ORBIT
IS
THAT
YOU
CAN
USE
ALL
OF
YOUR
LAUNCH
CAPABILITY
FOR
BOOSTING
THE
PAYLOAD
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
CARRY
UP
A
SECOND
ROCKET
TO
CIRCULARIZE
THE
ORBIT
WERNER
SAID
THE
OTHER
ADVANTAGE
TO
A
SOLAR
ORBIT
HE
SAID
IS
THAT
ITS
IN
A
BETTER
THERMAL
ENVIRONMENT
AWAY
FROM
THE
HEAT
OF
THE
EARTH
ADDITIONAL
MAJOR
CHANGES
IN
SIRTFS
REDESIGN
INCLUDE
SHORTENING
THE
MISSION
FROM
FIVE
TO
THREE
YEARS
AND
BUILDING
A
SPACECRAFT
THAT
IS
LESS
THAN
HALF
AS
HEAVY
AS
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
PLAN
ATLAS
SIRTF
WILL
WEIGH
KILOGRAMS
POUNDS
COMPARED
TO
TITAN
SIRTFS
KILOGRAMS
POUNDS
ALL
OF
THAT
ADDS
UP
TO
A
LESS
STRESSFUL
LAUNCH
ENVIRONMENT
WERNER
SAID
AND
A
COST
SAVINGS
OF
MORE
THAN
MILLION
FOR
THE
LAUNCH
IN
ADDITION
TO
INCREASED
SAVINGS
IN
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE
SMALLER
LESS
MASSIVE
SPACECRAFT
WERNER
SAID
SIRTFS
REDESIGN
CAME
AS
A
RESULT
OF
CONGRESS
TELLING
NASA
YOURE
TRYING
TO
DO
TOO
MANY
THINGS
IF
YOU
WANT
US
TO
SUPPORT
SIRTF
WHICH
IS
A
GOOD
PROJECT
DEVELOP
A
PLAN
TO
SEE
HOW
IT
FITS
INTO
NASAS
OVERALL
STRATEGY
SHORTLY
THEREAFTER
SIRTF
WAS
NAMED
AS

HIGHEST
PRIORITY
FLAGSHIP
SCIENTIFIC
MISSION
BY
THE
INTERDISCIPLINARY

ADVISORY
COMMITTEE
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
BLESSING
FROM
THE
NATIONAL
ACADEMY
OF
SCIENCES
WHILE
THE
SPACECRAFT
AND
ITS
INSTRUMENTS
REQUIRED
DESCOPING
TO
KEEP
THE
PROJECT
ALIVE
SIRTFS
MAJOR
SCIENTIFIC
CONTRIBUTION
ALWAYS
PROMISED
TO
COME
ABOUT
FROM
ITS
ADVANCED
INFRARED
DETECTOR
ARRAYS
WHICH
WILL
ALLOW
IMAGES
TO
BE
DEVELOPED
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
TIMES
FASTER
THAN
BEFORE
ACCORDING
TO
EVANS
UP
UNTIL
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AGO
WERNER
SAID
ALL
INFRARED
ASTRONOMY
WAS
DONE
WITH
SINGLE
DETECTORS
OR
VERY
SMALL
ARRAYS
OF
INDIVIDUALLY
ASSEMBLED
DETECTORS
SINCE
THEN
THE
DEPARTMENT
OF
DEFENSE
HAS
DEVELOPED
A
PROGRAM
TO
PRODUCE
ARRAYS
OF
TENS
OR
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
DETECTORS
RATHER
THAN
JUST
A
FEW
AND
THOSE
ARE
VERY
WELL
SUITED
FOR
USE
ON
SIRTF
WERNER
NOTED
THAT
IN
ADDITION
TO
DEALING
WITH
BUDGET
PRESSURES
CONGRESS
IS
CURRENTLY
WATCHING
NASA
PROJECTS
WITH
AN
EYE
OUT
FOR
ANY
TECHNOLOGICAL
SPINOFF
ON
THAT
QUESTION
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
SOME
THINGS
TO
SAY
HE
SAID
BECAUSE
THE
DETECTORS
WERE
USING
ARE
STRAIGHT
OFF
VARIOUS
MILITARY
DEVELOPMENTS
ALSO
SIRTF
WILL
BE
BUILT
BY
THE
US
AEROSPACE
INDUSTRY
AND
ITS
A
REAL
TECHNOLOGICAL
AND
ENGINEERING
CHALLENGE
IN
ADDITION
TO
BEING
A
TREMENDOUS
SCIENTIFIC
PROJECT
SIRTF
WILL
BE
USED
BY
THE
ENTIRE
ASTRONOMICAL
COMMUNITY
WERNER
ADDED
BUT
THE
REVISED
THREEYEAR
MISSION
PUTS
A
PREMIUM
ON
OBSERVING
TIME
WE
HAVE
TO
EDUCATE
THE
USER
COMMUNITY
AND
DEVELOP
A
PROGRAM
THAT
INVOLVES
EARLY
SURVEYS
AND
QUICK
TURNAROUND
OF
THE
DATA
WERNER
SAID
THE
DOWNSIZING
OF
THE
PROJECT
REQUIRED
A
REDUCTION
IN
SCOPE
AND
COMPLEXITY
OF
SIRTFS
THREE
INSTRUMENTS

INFRARED
SPECTROGRAPH

AND

IMAGING
PHOTOMETER
HOWEVER
THESE
REDUCTIONS
WILL
ONLY
RESULT
IN
LOSSES
OF
EFFICIENCY
RATHER
THAN
CAPABILITY
HE
SAID
THE
PROJECT
HOPES
TO
START
A
PHASE
B
ACTIVITY
IN
WHICH
WILL
PROVIDE
A
DETAILED
CONCEPT
FOR

EVANS

AM

OPTIMISTIC

HE
SAID
IT
WILL
PROVIDE
A
TREMENDOUS
RETURN
FOR
THE
INVESTMENT
WERNER
ADDED
THAT
AN
ADDITIONAL
BENEFIT
FROM
THE
PROJECT
WILL
BE
THE
ENRICHMENT
OF
OUR
INTELLECTUAL
