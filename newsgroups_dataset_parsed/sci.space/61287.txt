JOHN
F
CARR
SAID
JFC
IF
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTERS
ARE
EXTRAGALACTIC

ABSORPTION
FROM
THE
JFC
GALAXY
BE
EXPECTED
HOW
TRANSPARENT
IS
THE

SO
IF
THE

INCORRECT
ASSUME

GAMMA
RAY
PROPAGATION
JB
COULD
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
THAT
WE
ARE
ACTUALLY
SEEING
MUCH
LESS
ENERGETIC
JB
EVENTS
HAPPENING
MUCH
CLOSER
TO

THE

RAYS
JB
BEING
SHORTER

THE

OF
THE
GALAXY
WELL
MAYBE
NOT
ZERO
BUT
VERY

ENERGIES
FOR
GAMMA

THE
GALAXY
IS
EFFECTIVELY
TRANSPARENT
