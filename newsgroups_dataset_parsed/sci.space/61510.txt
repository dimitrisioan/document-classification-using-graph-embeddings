vandalizing
the
sky
dale
sez
mr
hathaways
post
is
right
on
the
money
if
a
little
lengthy
in
short
an
orbiting
billboard
would
be
trash
in
the
same
way
that
a
billboard
on
the
earth
is
trash
billboards
make
a
place
look
trashy
that
is
why
there
are
laws
in
many
places
prohibiting
their
use
the
light
pollution
complaints
are
mainly
an
attempt
to
find
some
tangible
reason
to
be
against
orbiting
billboards
because
people
dont
feel
morally
justified
to
complain
on
the
grounds
that
these
things
would
defile
the
beauty
of
the
sky
i
dont
buy
it
if
the
things
had
no
value
at
all
people
wouldnt
spend
money
to
make
them
so
their
lack
of
value
is
just
your
opinion
not
an
actual
fact
which
is
neither
a
philisophical
or
legal
basis
for
prohibiting
them
on
the
other
hand
i
lived
in
oakbrook
il
for
a
while
where
zoning
laws
prohibit
billboards
as
you
mention
above
i
think
it
was
a
fine
law
despite
its
contradictory
basis
i
would
guess
that
the
best
legal
and
moral
basis
for
protest
would
be
violation
of
private
property
i
bought
this
house
out
in
the
boondocks
specifically
to
enjoy
my
hobby
amateur
astronomy
now
this
billboard
has
made
that
investment
worthless
so
i
want
the
price
of
the
property
in
damages
it
wouldnt
take
too
many
succesful
cases
like
that
to
make
billsats
prohibitively
expensive
