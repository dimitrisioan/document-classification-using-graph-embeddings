to

on
june
and
two
of
the
soviet
unions
mighty
proton
rockets
lifted
off
from
the
tyuratam
space
center
in
the
kazakhstan
republic
aboard
those
boosters
were
a
new
breed
of
venera
probe
for
the
planet
venus
designated
venera
and
the
probes
were
meant
not
for
landing
yet
more
spherical
craft
on
the
venerean
surface
but
to
radar
map
the
planet
in
detail
from
orbit
to
accomplish
this
task
the
basic
venera
design
was
modified
in
numerous
areas
the
central
bus
core
was
made
one
meter
inches
longer
to
carry
the
two
tons
of
propellant
required
for
braking
into
orbit
double
the
fuel
carried
by
the
venera
and
orbiters
eight
years
earlier
extra
solar
panels
were
added
on
to
give
the
vehicles
more
power
for
handling
the
large
amounts
of
data
which
would
be
created
by
the
radar
imaging
the
dishshaped
communications
antennae
were
also
made
one
meter
larger
to
properly
transmit
this
information
to
earth
atop
the
buses
where
landers
were
usually
placed
were
installed
the
by
by
polyus
v
sidelooking
radar
antennae
the
radar
system
possibly
a
terrainimaging
version
of
the
nuclearpowered
satellites
used
by
the
soviets
for
earth
ocean
surveillance
would
be
able
to
map
venus
surface
at
a
resolution
of
one
to
two
kilometers
to
miles
the
soviet
probes
imaging
parameters
were
a
vast
improvement
over
the
united
states
pioneer
venus
orbiter
which
could
reveal
objects
no
smaller
than
kilometers
miles
in
diameter
and
while
the
veneras
resolution
was
comparable
to
that
of
similar
observations
made
by
the
arecibo
radio
telescope
on
the
island
of
puerto
rico
the
orbiters
would
be
examining
the
northern
pole
of
venus
this
region
was
unobtainable
by
either
arecibo
or
pioneer
venus
and
appeared
to
contain
a
number
of
potentially
interesting
geological
features
worthy
of
investigation
on
october
after
an
interplanetary
journey
of
million
kilometers
million
miles
and
two
midcourse
corrections
venera
fired
its
braking
rockets
over
venus
to
place
itself
in
a
polar
orbit
by
kilometers
by
miles
around
the
planet
completing
one
revolution
every
twentyfour
hours
venera
followed
suit
four
days
later
the
twin
probes
thus
became
venus
first
polarcircling
spacecraft
radar
operations
began
on
october
for
venera
and
october
for
venera
for
up
to
sixteen
minutes
every
orbit
over
the
north
pole
the
probes
would
make
a
radar
sweep
of
the
surface
kilometers
ninety
miles
wide
and
nine
thousand
kilometers
miles
long
the
craft
would
then
head
out
to
the
highest
part
of
their
orbits
over
the
south
pole
to
recharge
their
batteries
and
transmit
the
data
back
to
two
large
soviet
antennae
on
earth
each
strip
of
information
took
eight
hours
to
process
by
computer
by
the
end
of
their
main
missions
in
july
of
the
veneras
had
mapped
million
square
kilometers
million
square
miles
thirty
percent
of
the
entire
planet
venera
and
revealed
that
venus
has
a
surface
geology
more
complex
than
shown
by
pioneer
venus
in
the
late
numerous
hills
mountains
ridges
valleys
and
plains
spread
across
the
landscape
many
of
them
apparently
formed
by
lava
from
erupting
volcanoes
in
the
last
one
billion
years
in
planetary
terms
this
makes
the
venerean
surface
rather
young
hundreds
of
craters
were
detected
as
well
the
largest
of
which
had
to
have
been
created
by
meteorites
planetoids
would
be
a
better
term
here
at
least
fourteen
kilometers
miles
across
due
to
venus
very
dense
atmosphere
there
were
some
disagreements
between
us
and
soviet
scientists
on
the
origins
of
certain
surface
features
for
example
the
probes
owners
declared
that
the
wide
crater
at
the
summit
of
high
maxwell
montes
the
tallest
mountain
on
the
planet
was
the
result
of
a
meteorite
impact
american
scientists
on
the
other
hand
felt
the
crater
was
proof
that
maxwell
was
a
huge
volcano
sitting
on
the
northern
continent
of
ishtar
terra
in
any
event
the
us
decided
to
wait
on
making
verdicts
about
venus
until
the
arrival
of
their
own
radar
probe
scheduled
for
later
in
the
decade
originally
named
the
venus
orbiting
imaging
radar
voir
its
initial
design
was
scaled
back
and
the
craft
was
redesig
nated
the
venus
radar
mapper
vrm
eventually
the
machine
would
be
called
magellan
after
the
portuguese
navigator
ferdinand
magellan
circa
this
vehicle
would
map
the
entire
planet
in
even
finer
detail
than
the
veneras
for
the
time
however
the
soviet
probes
maintained
that
distinction
radar
imaging
was
not
the
only
ability
of
the
veneras
bolted
next
to
the
polyus
v
radar
antenna
were
the
omega
altimeter
and
the
fourier
infrared
spectrometer
the
latter
for
measuring
the
worlds
temperatures
the
majority
of
the
areas
covered
registered
about
five
hundred
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
but
a
few
locations
were
two
hundred
degrees
hotter
possibly
indicating
current
volcanic
activity
the
probes
also
found
that
the
clouds
over
the
poles
were
five
to
eight
kilometers
three
to
miles
lower
than
at
the
equator
in
contrast
the
polar
air
above
sixty
kilometers
thirtysix
miles
altitude
was
five
to
twenty
degrees
warmer
than
the
equatorial
atmosphere
at
similar
heights
when
the
main
mapping
mission
ended
in
july
of
there
were
plans
for
at
least
one
of
the
veneras
to
radar
image
the
surface
at
more
southernly
latitudes
unfortunately
this
idea
did
not
come
to
pass
as
the
orbiters
may
not
have
possessed
enough
attitudecontrol
gas
to
perform
the
operation
venera
and
ceased
transmission
in
march
of
leaving
the
soviet
institute
of
radiotechnology
and
electronics
with
six
hundred
kilometers
miles
of
radar
data
tape
to
sort
into
an
atlas
of
twentyseven
maps
of
the
northern
hemisphere
of
venus
venus
by
balloon
for
years
the
thick
atmosphere
of
venus
had
been
a
tempting
target
to
scientists
who
wished
to
explore
the
planets
mantle
of
air
with
balloonborne
instruments
professor
jacques
blamont
of
the
french
space
agency
centre
national
detudes
spatiales
cnes
had
proposed
such
an
idea
as
far
back
as
only
to
have
a
joint
frenchsoviet
balloon
mission
canceled
in
nevertheless
late
in
the
year
such
dreams
would
eventually
come
true
when
two
proton
rockets
were
sent
skyward
on
december
and
the
soviet
union
provided
western
observers
with
the
first
clear
full
views
of
the
booster
which
had
been
launching
every
soviet
venus
probe
since
this
was
but
one
of
many
firsts
for
the
complex
mission
the
unmanned
probes
launched
into
space
that
december
were
named
vega
and
a
contraction
of
the
words
venera
and
gallei
gallei
being
the
russian
word
for
halley
not
only
did
the
spacecraft
have
more
than
one
mission
to
perform
they
also
had
more
than
one
celestial
objective
to
explore
namely
the
comet
halley
this
famous
periodic
traveler
was
making
its
latest
return
to
the
inner
regions
of
the
solar
system
since
its
last
visit
in
since
it
was
widely
believed
that
comets
are
the
icy
remains
from
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
five
billion
years
ago
scientists
around
the
world
gave
high
priority
to
exploring
one
of
the
few
such
bodies
which
actually
come
close
to
earth
most
comets
linger
in
the
cold
and
dark
outer
fringes
of
the
solar
system
some
like
halley
are
perturbed
by
various
forces
and
fall
in
towards
the
sun
where
they
circle
for
millennia
spewing
out
ice
and
debris
for
millions
of
kilometers
from
the
warmth
of
each
solar
encounter
the
soviet
union
along
with
the
european
space
agency
esa
and
japans
institute
of
space
and
astronautical
science
isas
did
not
wish
to
miss
out
on
this
first
opportunity
in
human
history
to
make
a
close
examination
of
halley
the
esa
would
be
using
the
cylindrical
giotto
probe
to
make
a
dangerously
close
photographic
flyby
of
the
comet
while
japans
first
deep
space
craft
sakigake
pioneer
and
suisei
comet
would
view
halley
from
a
much
safer
distance
scientists
in
the
united
states
also
desired
to
study
the
comet
from
the
vantage
of
a
space
probe
at
one
time
envisioning
a
vessel
powered
by
solar
sails
or
ion
engines
however
government
budget
cuts
to
nasa
canceled
the
american
efforts
the
us
would
have
to
make
do
primarily
with
earthbased
observations
and
the
sharing
of
data
from
other
nations
though
an
instrument
named
the
dust
counter
and
mass
analyzer
ducma
designed
by
chicago
university
professor
john
simpson
was
added
on
the
soviet
mission
in
may
of
the
soviets
answer
to
halley
were
the
vegas
instead
of
building
an
entirely
new
craft
for
the
mission
the
soviets
decided
to
modify
their
venera
bus
design
to
encounter
the
comet
while
performing
an
advanced
venus
mission
along
the
way
as
vega
and
reached
venus
the
buses
would
drop
off
one
landerballoon
each
and
use
the
mass
of
the
shrouded
planet
to
swing
them
towards
comet
halley
much
as
the
us
probe
mariner
used
venus
to
flyby
mercury
eleven
years
earlier
the
soviet
craft
would
then
head
on
to
halley
helping
to
pinpoint
the
location
of
the
comets
erupting
nucleus
for
the
giotto
probe
to
dive
in
only
kilometers
miles
away
in
march
of
as
planned
the
two
vegas
arrived
at
venus
in
june
of
vega
released
its
payload
first
on
the
ninth
day
of
the
month
the
lander
making
a
twoday
descent
towards
the
planet
the
craft
touched
the
upper
atmosphere
on
the
morning
of
june
sixtyone
kilometers
miles
above
the
venerean
surface
a
small
container
was
released
by
the
lander
which
produced
a
parachute
at
kilometers
miles
altitude
thus
the
first
balloon
probe
ever
to
explore
venus
had
successfully
arrived
one
kilometer
after
the
opening
of
the
parachute
helium
gas
was
pumped
into
the
tefloncoated
plastic
balloon
inflating
it
to
a
diameter
of
meters
feet
dangling
on
a
tether
thirteen
meters
feet
below
was
the
instrument
package
properly
known
as
an
aerostat
the
top
part
of
the
aerostat
consisted
of
a
cone
which
served
as
an
antenna
and
tether
attachment
point
to
the
balloon
beneath
it
was
the
transmitter
electronics
and
instruments
connected
at
the
bottom
was
a
nephelometer
for
measuring
cloud
particles
the
aerostat
was
painted
with
a
special
white
finish
to
keep
at
bay
the
corroding
mist
of
sulfuric
acid
which
permeated
the
planets
atmosphere
the
vega
balloon
was
dropped
into
the
night
side
of
venus
just
north
of
the
equator
scientists
were
concerned
that
the
gas
bag
would
burst
in
the
heat
of
daylight
so
they
placed
it
in
the
darkened
hemisphere
to
give
the
craft
as
much
time
as
possible
to
return
data
this
action
necessitated
that
the
landers
come
down
in
the
dark
as
well
effectively
removing
the
camera
systems
used
on
previous
missions
the
author
wonders
though
if
they
could
have
used
floodlights
similar
to
the
ones
attached
to
venera
and
in
when
soviet
scientists
had
thought
the
planets
surface
was
enshrouded
in
a
perpetual
twilight
due
to
the
permanently
thick
cloud
cover
the
first
balloon
transmitted
for
hours
right
into
the
day
hemisphere
before
its
lithium
batteries
failed
covering
kilometers
miles
the
threat
of
bursting
in
the
day
heat
did
not
materialize
the
vega
balloon
was
stationed
at
a
altitude
after
dropping
ballast
at
fifty
kilometers
thirty
miles
for
this
was
considered
the
most
active
of
the
three
main
cloud
layers
reported
by
pioneer
venus
in
indeed
the
balloon
was
pushed
across
the
planet
at
speeds
up
to
kilometers
miles
per
hour
strong
vertical
winds
bobbed
the
craft
up
and
down
two
to
three
hundred
meters
to
feet
through
most
of
the
journey
the
layers
air
temperature
averaged
forty
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
pressure
was
a
mere
earth
atmosphere
the
nephelometer
could
find
no
clear
regions
in
the
surrounding
clouds
early
in
the
first
balloons
flight
the
vega
lander
was
already
headed
towards
the
venerean
surface
both
landers
were
equipped
with
a
soil
drill
and
analyzer
similar
to
the
ones
carried
on
venera
and
in
however
vega
would
become
unable
to
report
the
composition
of
the
ground
at
its
landing
site
in
rusalka
planitia
the
mermaid
plain
north
of
aphrodite
terra
while
still
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
away
from
landing
a
timer
malfunction
caused
the
drill
to
accidentally
begin
its
programmed
activity
sixteen
kilometers
miles
above
the
surface
there
was
neither
any
way
to
shut
off
the
instrument
before
touchdown
nor
reactivate
it
after
landing
this
was
unfortunate
not
only
for
the
general
loss
of
data
but
also
for
the
fact
that
most
of
venus
was
covered
with
such
smooth
lowlevel
lava
plains
and
had
never
before
been
directly
examined
nevertheless
the
surface
temperature
and
pressure
was
calculated
at
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
earth
atmospheres
respectively
during
the
landers
minutes
of
ground
transmissions
a
large
amount
of
background
infrared
radiation
was
also
recorded
at
the
site
as
had
been
done
when
the
drills
and
cameras
on
venera
and
had
failed
in
december
of
the
soviets
focused
on
the
data
returned
during
the
landers
plunge
through
the
atmosphere
the
frenchsoviet
malachite
mass
spectrometer
detected
sulfur
chlorine
and
possibly
phosphorus
it
is
the
sulfur
possibly
from
active
volcanoes
which
gives
the
venerean
clouds
their
yellowish
color
the
sigma
gas
chromatograph
found
that
every
cubic
meter
of
air
between
an
altitude
of
and
kilometers
and
miles
contained
one
milligram
grain
of
sulfuric
acid
the
vega
data
on
the
overall
structure
of
the
cloud
decks
appeared
to
be
at
odds
with
the
information
from
pioneer
venus
the
case
was
made
even
stronger
by
the
fact
that
vega
results
nearly
matched
its
twin
the
vegas
found
only
two
main
cloud
layers
instead
of
the
three
reported
by
the
us
probes
the
layers
were
three
to
five
kilometers
to
miles
thick
at
altitudes
of
and
kilometers
and
miles
the
clouds
persisted
like
a
thin
fog
until
clearing
at
an
altitude
of
kilometers
miles
much
lower
than
the
pv
readings
one
possibility
for
the
discrepan
cies
may
have
been
radical
structural
changes
in
the
venerean
air
over
the
last
seven
years
when
the
lander
and
balloon
finally
went
silent
the
last
functioning
part
of
the
vega
mission
the
flyby
bus
sailed
on
for
a
millionkilometer
millionmile
journey
around
the
sun
to
become
the
first
probe
to
meet
comet
halley
on
march
the
bus
made
a
pass
at
the
dark
and
icy
visitor
before
traveling
on
in
interplanetary
space
the
soviets
had
accomplished
their
first
mission
to
two
celestial
bodies
with
one
space
vessel
on
june
vega
released
its
landerballoon
payload
for
a
twoday
fall
towards
venus
like
its
duplicate
the
vega
balloon
radioed
information
back
to
the
twenty
antennae
tracking
it
on
earth
for
hours
before
battery
failure
on
the
morning
side
of
the
planet
during
its
flight
over
venus
the
second
balloon
entered
in
a
rather
still
environment
which
became
less
so
twenty
hours
into
the
mission
after
hours
mission
time
the
air
became
even
more
turbulent
for
a
further
eight
hours
when
the
balloon
passed
over
a
five
kilometer
threemile
mountain
on
the
continent
of
aphrodite
terra
a
powerful
downdraft
pulled
the
craft
kilometers
miles
towards
the
surface
temperature
sensors
on
the
vega
balloon
reported
that
the
air
layer
it
was
moving
through
was
consistently
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
cooler
than
the
area
explored
by
the
vega
balloon
this
was
corroborated
by
the
vega
lander
as
it
passed
through
the
balloons
level
no
positive
indications
of
lightning
were
made
by
either
balloon
and
the
second
aerostats
nephelometer
failed
to
function
the
vega
lander
touched
down
on
the
northern
edge
of
aphrodite
terras
western
arm
on
the
fifteenth
of
june
kilometers
miles
southeast
of
vega
the
landers
resting
place
was
smoother
than
thought
indicating
either
a
very
ancient
and
worn
surface
or
a
relatively
young
one
covered
in
fresh
lava
the
soil
drill
was
in
working
order
and
reported
a
rock
type
known
as
anorthositetroctolite
rare
on
earth
but
present
in
lunas
highlands
this
rock
is
rich
in
aluminum
and
silicon
but
lacking
in
iron
and
magnesium
a
high
degree
of
sulfur
was
also
present
in
the
soil
the
air
around
vega
measured
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
and
earth
atmospheres
essentially
a
typical
day
or
night
on
venus
far
above
the
vega
lander
its
carrier
bus
sped
past
venus
at
a
distance
of
kilometers
miles
and
followed
its
twin
to
comet
halley
making
a
closer
flyby
on
march
at
just
kilometers
miles
both
probes
helped
to
reveal
that
the
comet
is
a
very
dark
and
irregularshaped
mass
about
fourteen
kilometers
miles
across
rotating
once
every
hours
give
or
take
three
hours
since
both
vega
craft
were
still
functioning
after
their
halley
encounters
soviet
scientists
considered
an
option
to
send
the
probes
to
other
celestial
objects
one
prime
target
was
the
near
earth
planetoid
adonis
which
vega
could
pass
at
a
distance
of
six
million
kilometers
million
miles
sadly
the
soviets
had
to
back
out
on
the
opportunity
to
become
the
first
nation
to
fly
a
spacecraft
past
a
planetoid
when
it
was
discovered
that
there
was
not
enough
maneuvering
fuel
in
the
probe
to
reach
adonis
as
planned
vega
and
were
quietly
shut
down
in
early
future
plans
diverted
the
impressive
vega
mission
had
given
some
scientists
numerous
ideas
and
hope
for
even
more
ambitious
expeditions
to
the
second
world
from
the
sun
one
example
was
the
vesta
mission
planned
for
the
early
this
sovietfrench
collaboration
called
for
the
launch
of
multiple
probes
on
a
single
proton
rocket
in
either
or
the
craft
would
first
swing
by
venus
and
drop
off
several
landers
and
balloon
probes
the
aerostats
would
be
designed
to
survive
in
the
planets
corrosive
atmosphere
for
up
to
one
month
a
large
improvement
over
the
vega
balloons
two
days
the
mission
would
then
head
out
to
investigate
several
planetoids
and
comets
including
a
possible
landing
on
vesta
thus
the
mission
name
the
most
reflective
main
belt
planetoid
as
seen
from
earth
unfortunately
for
venus
exploration
plans
began
to
change
in
the
soviet
union
in
the
soviets
decided
to
reroute
the
vesta
mission
to
the
red
planet
mars
instead
of
venus
keeping
the
comet
and
planetoid
aspects
intact
by
this
time
in
the
soviet
space
program
interest
was
focusing
on
mars
already
under
construction
was
an
entirely
new
probe
design
called
phobos
two
members
of
this
class
were
planned
to
leave
earth
in
and
orbit
mars
the
next
year
phobos
and
would
then
place
the
first
instruments
on
mars
largest
moon
phobos
all
this
was
a
prelude
to
even
more
advanced
mars
expeditions
including
balloon
probes
rovers
soil
sample
return
craft
and
eventually
human
explorers
in
the
early
twentyfirst
century
the
environment
of
venus
was
just
too
hostile
for
any
serious
consideration
of
human
colonization
in
the
near
future
but
things
began
to
look
bleak
for
soviet
venus
and
mars
exploration
both
phobos
probes
failed
to
complete
their
missions
one
losing
contact
on
the
way
to
the
red
planet
in
and
the
other
going
silent
in
mars
orbit
just
one
week
before
the
planned
moon
landing
in
march
of
in
a
plan
was
devised
for
a
venus
orbiter
to
drop
eight
to
ten
penetrators
around
the
planet
in
several
years
later
the
mission
launch
date
was
moved
to
the
year
and
has
now
been
put
on
indefinite
hold
no
other
official
soviet
missions
to
venus
have
since
been
put
forth
a
sad
commentary
after
twentyfive
years
of
continuous
robotic
exploration
of
the
planet
during
the
late
a
drastic
political
and
economic
change
was
taking
over
the
soviet
union
president
mikhail
gorbachev
began
to
open
up
his
nation
to
the
benefits
of
increased
cooperation
with
the
rest
of
the
nations
particularly
those
in
the
west
while
the
culture
became
less
oppressive
than
in
the
past
the
economy
was
taking
a
very
rough
ride
as
it
also
underwent
the
effects
of
a
free
market
these
effects
hit
everywhere
including
the
space
program
missions
at
all
levels
were
cut
back
the
soviets
began
making
almost
desperate
attempts
to
cooperate
with
other
spacefaring
nations
either
to
keep
their
remaining
programs
alive
or
just
to
make
money
in
early
it
was
reported
that
the
soviets
were
offering
for
sale
several
fullyequipped
veneras
they
had
in
storage
for
the
price
of
million
dollars
each
an
incredibly
low
price
for
any
planetary
probe
no
nation
took
them
up
on
the
bargain
meanwhile
the
united
states
was
gearing
up
for
new
venus
missions
of
their
own
magellan
and
galileo
the
us
reactivated
their
longdormant
planetary
exploration
with
the
launch
of
the
space
shuttle
atlantis
on
may
aboard
the
shuttle
was
the
magellan
spacecraft
a
combination
of
spare
parts
from
other
us
probes
designed
to
make
the
most
detailed
and
complete
radarmapping
of
venus
in
history
when
magellan
reached
the
second
world
in
august
of
it
would
be
able
to
map
almost
the
entire
planet
down
to
a
resolution
of
meters
feet
surpassing
the
abilities
of
venera
and
in
the
interim
another
american
probe
was
launched
from
a
space
shuttle
which
would
make
a
quick
flyby
of
venus
on
its
way
to
orbit
the
giant
planet
jupiter
in
on
october
the
shuttle
atlantis
released
its
second
unmanned
planetary
probe
into
space
named
galileo
after
the
famous
italian
astronomer
who
discovered
the
probes
primary
targets
major
moons
in
in
the
absence
of
a
powerful
enough
booster
to
send
galileo
on
a
direct
flight
to
the
jovian
planet
the
probe
was
sent
around
venus
and
earth
several
times
to
build
up
enough
speed
to
reach
jupiter
as
a
result
venus
became
galileos
first
planetary
goal
in
february
of
the
probe
radioed
back
images
of
the
planets
swirling
clouds
and
further
indications
of
lightning
in
that
violent
atmosphere
on
the
drawing
boards
with
the
incredible
success
of
magellan
in
the
last
few
years
new
plans
have
been
laid
out
for
further
journeys
to
venus
scien
tists
in
the
us
have
talked
to
space
scientists
in
the
former
soviet
union
now
the
commonwealth
of
independent
states
since
january
of
a
cooperative
effort
to
launch
new
venera
lander
missions
within
in
the
next
decade
japan
india
and
the
esa
have
also
considered
their
own
venus
missions
in
the
next
few
decades
in
february
of
nasa
came
up
with
several
new
venus
projects
as
part
of
their
discovery
program
for
launching
inexpensive
probes
throughout
the
solar
system
for
venus
two
missions
were
selected
for
further
study
a
venus
multiprobe
mission
involving
the
landing
of
fourteen
small
probes
over
one
hemisphere
to
measure
winds
air
temperature
and
pressure
and
the
venus
composition
probe
designed
to
study
venus
atmosphere
while
descending
through
the
thick
air
with
the
aid
of
a
parachute
much
as
the
soviets
had
done
since
final
project
decisions
will
be
made
in
humans
on
venus
will
a
human
ever
be
able
to
stand
on
the
surface
of
venus
at
present
the
leadmelting
temperatures
and
crushing
air
pressure
would
be
threatening
to
any
earth
life
not
protected
in
something
even
tougher
than
a
venera
lander
plans
have
been
looked
into
changing
the
environment
of
venus
itself
into
something
more
like
earths
however
it
should
be
noted
that
any
such
undertaking
will
require
the
removal
of
much
of
the
thick
carbon
dioxide
atmosphere
a
major
reduction
in
surface
heat
and
the
ability
to
speed
up
the
planets
rotation
rate
to
something
a
bit
faster
than
once
every
earth
days
such
a
project
may
take
centuries
if
not
millennia
in
the
meantime
efforts
should
be
made
to
better
understand
venus
as
its
exists
today
we
still
have
yet
to
fully
know
how
a
world
so
seemingly
similar
to
earth
in
many
important
ways
became
instead
such
a
deadly
place
will
earth
ever
suffer
this
fate
perhaps
venus
holds
the
answers
such
answers
may
best
be
found
through
international
cooperation
including
the
nation
which
made
the
first
attempts
to
lift
the
cloudy
veils
from
venus
