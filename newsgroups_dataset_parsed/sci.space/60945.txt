i
remeber
reading
the
comment
that
general
dynamics
was
tied
into
this
in
connection
with
their
proposal
for
an
early
manned
landing
sorry
i
dont
rember
where
i
heard
this
but
im
fairly
sure
it
was
somewhere
reputable
anyone
else
know
anything
on
this
angle
the
general
chairman
is
paul
bialla
who
is
some
official
of
general
dynamics
the
emphasis
seems
to
be
on
a
scaleddown
fast
plan
to
put
people
on
the
moon
in
an
impoverished
spaceflightfunding
climate
youd
think
it
would
be
a
golden
opportunity
to
do
lots
of
precusor
work
for
modest
money
using
an
agressive
series
of
robot
spacecraft
but
theres
not
a
hint
of
this
in
the
brochure
hrumph
they
didnt
send
me
anything
youre
not
hanging
out
with
the
right
people
apparently

gonna
keep

until
i
write
the
song

that
makes
