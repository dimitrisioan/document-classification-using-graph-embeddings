re
vandalizing
the
sky
in
george
f

writes
i
was
suggesting
that
the
minority
of
professional
and
amateur
astronomers
have
the
right
to
a
dark
uncluttered
night
sky
and
from
whence
does
this
right
stem
that
it
overrides
the
rights
of
the
rest
of
us
let
me
give
you
an
example
when
you
watch
tv
they
have
commercials
to
pay
for
the
programming
you
accept
that
as
part
of
watching
if
you
dont
like
it
you
can
turn
it
off
if
you
want
to
view
the
night
sky
and
there
is
a
floating
billboard
out
there
you
cant
turn
it
off
its
the
same
reasoning
that
limits
billboards
in
scenic
areas
and
if
you
want
to
view
that
television
station
you
have
to
watch
the
commercials
you
cant
turn
them
off
and
still
be
viewing
the
television
station
in
other
words
if
you
dont
like
what
you
see
dont
look
there
is
no
right
i
can
think
of
that
you
have
to
force
other
people
to
conform
to
your
idea
of
aesthetic
behaviour
whats
next
laws
regulating
how
people
must
dress
and
look
so
as
to
appeal
to
your
fashion
sense
since
you
have
this
right
of
an
aesthetic
view

george
its
called
a
democracy
the
majority
rules
sorry
if
ytou
dont
like
it
i
suggest
you
modify
the
constitution
to
include
a
constitutional
right
to
dark
skies
the
theory
of
government
here
is
that
the
majority
rules
except
in
the
nature
of
fundamental
civil
rights
i
say
any
reasonably
indepth
perusal
of
american
history
will
show
you
that
many
wasps
have
continued
the
practices
of
prejudice
discrimination
and
violence
against
others
of
different
races
religions
and
beliefs
despite
the
law
which
has
what
to
do
with
the
topic
of
discussion
pat
says
if
you
really
are
annoyed
get
some
legislation
to
create
a
dark
sky
zone
where
in
all
light
emissions
are
protected
in
the
zone
kind
of
like
the
national
radio
quiet
zone
did
you
know
about
that
near
teh
radio
telescope
observatory
in
west
virginia
they
have
a
mile
emcon
zone
theoretically
they
can
prevent
you
from
running
light
ac
motors
like
air
conditioners
and
vacuums
in
practice
they
use
it
mostly
to
control
large
radio
users
i
say
what
im
objecting
to
here
is
a
floating
billboard
that
presumably
would
move
around
in
the
sky
i
for
one
am
against
legislating
at
all
i
just
wish
that
people
had
a
bit
of
common
courtesy
and
would
consider
how
their
greed
for
money
impacts
the
more
ethereal
and
aesthetic
values
that
make
us
human
this
includes
the
need
for
wild
and
unspoiled
things
including
the
night
sky
oh
i
see
you
dont
want
any
legislation
that
might
impinge
on
you
you
just
want
everyone
else
on
the
planet
to
do
what
you
want
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
