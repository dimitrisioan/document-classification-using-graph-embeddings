GEORG
TUPAREV
WRITES
ANNOUNCEMENT
THE
HYPERKNOWLEDGE
PROJECT
FOR
NEXTSTEP
MOTIVATION
WE
ARE
A
HETEROGENEOUS
GROUP
OF
SCIENTISTS
AND
STUDENTS
WHO
FEEL
THAT
OUR
WORK
IS
CONTINUOUSLY
HINDERED
BY
COMPUTER
ENVIRONMENTS
DOMINATED
BY
INCOMPATIBLE
SCIENTIFIC
TOOLS
AND
MONSTROUS
SOFTWARE
PACKAGES
TOO
OFTEN
CLAIMING
TO
DO
EVERYTHING
WHAT
WE
NEED
IS
AN
OBJECTORIENTED
SCIENTIFIC
ENVIRONMENT
WHERE
THE
TOOLS
WE
CHOOSE
TO
USE
ARE
INTEGRATED
WITHOUT
BEING
PARTS
OF
A
CLOSED
SYSTEM
HIGHLY
INTERACTIVE
AND
EXTENDABLE
BOTH
BY
THE
ADDITION
OF
OUR
OWN
SPECIALIZED
OBJECTS
AND
BY
COMBINING
THE
AVAILABLE
TOOLS
GRAPHICALLY
THE
USE
OF
SUCH
AN
ENVIRONMENT
SHOULD
BE
A
NATURAL
EXTENSION
OF
OUR
WORK
REQUIRING
A
VERY
SHORT
LEARNING
PHASE
AND
PRACTICALLY
NO
USERDOCUMENTATION
I
KNOW
THIS
IS
KINDA
OFF
THE
SUBJECT
OF
SCISPACE
BUT
NOT
REALLY
I
WANT
TO
ANSWER
THIS
FOR
THEIR
AS
WELL
AS
EVERYONE
ELSES
INFORMATION
WHAT
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
PROPOSING
BY
AND
LARGE
ALREADY
EXISTS
AND
CAN
BE
PURCHASED
TODAY
IT
IS
CALLED
LABVIEW
BY
NATIONAL
INSTRUMENTS
IT
IS
A
WONDERFUL
OBJECT
ORIENTED
GRAPHICAL
PROGRAMMING
LANGUAGE
IT
HAS
BEEN
IMPLEMENTED
ON
BOTH
MACS
PCS
AND
VME
UNIX
BOXES
IT
IS
FARE
SUPERIOR
TO
ANY
PROGRAMMING
APPROACH
THAT
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN
AND
ALLOWED
US
TO
DECREASE
THE
SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT
TIME
FOR
OUR
SHUTTLE
PAYLOADS
BY
PERCENT
THIS
PROGRAM
IS
NOT
DEPENDENDANT
ON
SPECIFIC
HARDWARE
AND
ALREADY
HAS
EXENSIVE
ANALYSIS
CAPABILITY
WHY
REINVENT
THE
WHEEL
ON
A
PLATFORM
THAT
MAY
NOT
EXIST
IT
IS
A
GREAT
IDEA
BUT
LOOK
OUT
THERE
AT
WHAT
IS
AVAILABLE
TODAY
THE
HYDROGEN
LEAK
ON
THE
SHUTTLE
WAS
FOUND
USING
THIS
SOFTWARE
ALL
SSME
CONTROL
AND
SIMULATION
STUDIES
ALONG
WITH
THE
REAL
TESTING
AT
MSFC
IS
HANDLED
WITH
LABVIEW
THERE
ARE
TONS
OF
APPLICATIONS
WITH
THE
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
VIRTUAL
INSTRUMENTS
THAT
CAN
ACCOMPLISH
ANY
SPECIFIC
CUSTOM
TASK
THE
MAKER
DESIRES
WITH
THE
ADDITION
OF
SUPPORT
THE
COMPUTER
BECOMES
A
VIRTUAL
CONTROL
STATION
ALLOWING
THE
GRAPHIC
REPRESENTATION
OF
REMOTE
INSTRUMENTATION
WITH
SERIAL
IO
SUPPORT
THAT
INSTRUMENT
CAN
BE
ANYWHERE
THE
GROUND
CONTROL
SOFTWARE
FOR
THE
MAIN
CONTROL
OF
SEDSAT
WILL
UTILIZE
THIS
APPROACH
