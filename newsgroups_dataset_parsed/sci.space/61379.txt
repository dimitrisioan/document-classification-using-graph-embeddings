WRITES
THATS
FIVE
WEEKS
IN
A
BALLOON
AND
IF
ANYONE
CAN
TELL
ME
WHERE
TO
GET
IT
I
SURE
WOULD
LIKE
A
REPLY
IVE
BEEN
LOOKING
FOR
THAT
BOOK
FOR
TEN
YEAR
AND
NEVER
FOUND
IT
NOTE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
LOOKING
FOR
A
COLLECTORS
ITEM
IM
HOPING
THAT
SOMEONE
HAS
PUBLISHED
IT
IN
MODERN
TIMES
EITHER
IN
PAPERBACK
OR
HARDCOVER
IM
WILLING
TO
SPEND
OR
SO
TO
GET
A
COPY
I
TOO
AM
A
JULES
VERNE
COLLECTOR
AND
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
THOUGH
TOUGH
TO
FIND
IT
IS
OUT
THERE
I
KEEP
MY
EYES
OPEN
ALL
THE
TIME
FOR
HIS
BOOKS
AT
VARIOUS
BAY
AREA
USED
BOOK
STORES
AND
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
GET
VERY
LUCKY
YOU
JUST
NEED
DILIGENCE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THE
BOOK
STORE
SITUATION
NEAR
JSC
IS
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
BAY
AREA
BUT
GOOD
LUCK
I
HAVE
ALSO
HAD
EXCELLENT
LUCK
AT
THE
ANTIQUARIAN
BOOK
FAIR
WHICH
COMES
TO
SF
EVERY
OTHER
YEAR
THOUGH
THE
PRICES
ARE
MORE
IN
THE
RANGE
THAN
THE
YOU
WANT
TO
SPEND
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
FIND
IT
YOU
WONT
NEED
TO
SPEND
EVEN
THAT
MUCH
SINCE
MOST
PEOPLE
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
IT
I
THINK
I
PAID
ABOUT
FOR
MY
DUSTJACKETLESS
BUT
OTHERWISE
GOOD
CONDITION
COPY
WHICH
I
FOUND
ONE
DAY
AT
A
SMALL
BOOKSHOP
THAT
HAPPENED
TO
HAVE
JUST
BOUGHT
A
LOT
OF
RANDOM
BOOKS
AT
AN
ESTATE
SALE
OF
COURSE
IF
YOU
RE
WILLING
TO
BUY
BLIND
YOU
CAN
PUT
A
ADVERTISEMENT
IN
THE
ANTIQUARIAN
BOOKSELLERS
NEWSLETTER
THE
EXACT
TITLE
OF
WHICH
ESCAPES
ME
AT
THE
MOMENT
FIVE
WEEKS
IN
A
BALLOON
IS
NOT
THE
RAREST
OF
JULES
VERNE
BOOKS
SOMEONE
HAS
IT
FOR
SALE
SOMEWHERE
AND
THE
AB
IS
THE
WAY
TO
FIND
IT
IN
FACT
I
WOULD
BE
SURPRISED
IF
YOU
DIDNT
GET
MULTIPLE
OFFERS
OF
SALE
OF
COURSE
THAT
TAKES
THE
FUN
OUT
OF
HUNTING
FOR
IT
YOURSELF
GOOD
LUCK
