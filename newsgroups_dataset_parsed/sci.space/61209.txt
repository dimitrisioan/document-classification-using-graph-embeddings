ADVERTISING
OF
BRIAN
YAMAUCHI
ASKS
REGARDING
ORBITAL
BILLBOARDS
AND
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
MORE
DETAILS
OTHER
THAN
WHAT
WAS
IN

NEWS
BLIP
HOW
SERIOUS
IS
THIS
PROJECT
IS
THIS
JUST
IN
THE
WILD
IDEA
STAGE
OR
DOES
IT
HAVE
REAL
FUNDING
WELL
I
HAD
BEEN
COLLECTING
DATA
FOR
NEXT
EDITION
OF
THE

SPACE
NEWSSPACE
TECHNOLOGY
INVESTOR
TO
SUMMARIZE
SPACE
ADVERTISING
FIRST
ADVERTISING
ON
SPACE
VEHICLES
IS
NOT
NEW
IT
IS
VERY
COMMON
PRACTICE
TO
PUT
THE
COOPERATING
ORGANIZATIONS
LOGOS
ON
THE
SPACE
LAUNCH
VEHICLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
LATEST
GPS
LAUNCHER
HAD
THE
VERY
PROMINENT
LOGOS
ON
ITS
SIDE
OF
MCDONNELL
DOUGLAS
THE
DELTA
LAUNCHER
ROCKWELL
INTERNATIONAL
WHO
BUILT
THE
GPS
SATELLITE
USAF
WHO
PAID
FOR
THE
SATELLITE
AND
LAUNCH
AND
THE
GPSNAVSTAR
PROGRAM
OFFICE
THIS
HAS
NOT
BEEN
CONSIDERED
PAID
ADVERTISING
BUT
RATHER
PUBLIC
RELATIONS
SINCE
THE
RESTRICTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
SUCH
THAT
ONLY
ORGANIZATIONS
INVOLVED
IN
THE
LAUNCH
COULD
PUT
THEIR
LOGOS
ON
THE
SIDE
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
MONEY
EXCHANGED
FOR
THIS
HOWEVER
PUTTING
A
HIGH
LOGO
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
LAUNCH
VEHICLE
FACING
THE
CAMERAS
IS
ADVERTISING
AS
MUCH
AS
IT
IS
PUBLIC
RELATIONS
IN
MY
OPINION
AND
BY
THE
WAY
I
NOTE
THAT
THE
DCX
TEST
VEHICLE
HAS
RATHER
PROMINENT
MCDONNELLDOUGLAS
AND
SDIO
LOGOS
ON
THE
SIDE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SEVERAL
STUDIES
LOOKING
AT
THE
REVENUE
POTENTIALS
FOR
USE
OF
SPACE
VEHICLES
FOR
ADVERTISING
OR
PLACING
LARGE
ADVERTISING
SIGNS
IN
ORBIT
ON
THE
SHUTTLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
KNOW
OF
SEVERAL
SERIOUS
STUDIES
IN
THE
EARLY
AND
MID
WHICH
LOOKED
AT
PUTTING
LOGOS
ON
THE
EXTERNAL
TANK
OR
ON
THE
SIDES
OF
THE
PAYLOAD
BAY
THESE
VENTURES
WOULD
BE
DIFFERENT
THAN
PUBLIC
RELATIONS
IN
THAT
THE
LOGOS
OR
DISPLAYS
WOULD
NOT
BE
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
FIRMS
PARTICIPATING
ON
THAT
FLIGHT
AND
WOULD
INVOLVE
PAYMENT
OF
SUMS
FOR
THE
RIGHT
TO
FLY
THE
LOGOS
IN
A
PROMINENT
ORGANIZATION
FOR
EXAMPLE
PAINTING
THE
ET
TO
LOOK
LIKE
A
PEPSI
CAN
OR
PUTTING
A
DISNEYWORLD
LOGO
ON
THE
INSIDE
OF
THE
PAYLOAD
BAY
WHERE
THE
CAMERAS
WOULD
SCAN
PAST
IT
ADVERTS
ON
LAUNCH
VEHICLES
THE
FIRST
PAID
ADVERTISING
WAS
DONE
ON
A
SOVIET
LAUNCHER
IN
ABOUT
WHEN
SEVERAL
NONINVOLVED
FOREIGN
ORGANIZATIONS
WERE
ALLOWED
TO
PAY
TO
PUT
THEIR
LOGOS
ON
A
PROTON
LAUNCH
AN
ITALIAN
SHOE
COMPANY
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
FIRST
ADVERTISERS
I
REMEMBER
SIMILARLY
SOVIET
COSMONAUTS
ON
MIR
MADE
A
PAID
ADVERTISEMENT
FOR
THE
LAST
OLYMPIC
GAMES
AND
HAVE
GLEEFULLY
SHOWN
BANNERS
AND
OTHER

FROM
PARTICIPATING

AND
ORGANIZATIONS
MARS

FOR

GOT
A

FROM

AS
A
SPONSOR
OF
THE

OF
THE
BRITISH
VISITING
COSMONAUT
TO

NOW
US
FIRMS
ARE
STARTING
TO
PUT

THE

THE

BESIDES
THE
USUAL

FOR

A
CONCEPT
FOR
THIS
ADVERTISING
DISPLAY
WAS
PUBLISHED
IN

A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
AGO
AS
A

NOTE
ROBERT
LORSCH
AN
ADVERTISING
EXECUTIVE
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
SUING

HE
CHARGES

WITH
APPROPRIATING
AN
IDEA
HE
CREATED
WITH
THE

IN
TO
FORM
CORPORATE
ADVERTISING
SPONSORSHIPS
ON
NASA
SPACECRAFT
AS
A
WAY
TO
GET
FUNDING
FOR
THE

PROGRAM
LORSCH
CONTENDS
THAT
IN
SELLING
ADVERTISING
SPACE
ON
THE
UPCOMING
COMET
NASA
VIOLATED
AN
AGREEMENT
THAT
IT
WOULD
NOT
USE
HIS
IDEA
WITHOUT
HIM
BEING
THE
EXCLUSIVE
REPRESENTATIVE
FOR
NASA
AND
RECEIVING
COMPENSATION
THIS
IS
BEING
DISPUTED
SINCE
THE
LAUNCH
IS
A
COMMERCIAL
LAUNCH
AND
NASA
IS
RECEIVING
NONE
OF
THE
ADVERTISING
REVENUES
BUT
THE
FUNDING
FOR
