WRITES
UNFORTUNATELY
H
BEAM
PIPER
KILLED
HIM
SELF
JUST
WEEKS
SHORT
OF
HAVING
HIS
FIRST
BOOK
PUBLISHED
AND
HAVE
HIS
IDEAS
SEE
LIGHT
SUCH
A
WASTE
PIPER
LIVED
IN
MY
TOWN
WILLIAMSPORT
PA
WHEN
HE
KILLED
HIMSELF
IT
WAS
IN
THE
EARLY
HE
HAD
HAD
MORE
THAN
A
FEW
BOOKS
PUBLISHED
BY
THAT
TIME
BUT
HE
WAS
DOWN
ON
HIS
LUCK
FINANCIALLY
RUMOR
WAS
THAT
HE
WAS
HUNTING
URBAN
PIGEONS
WITH
BIRDSHOT
FOR
FOOD
HE
VIEWED
HIMSELF
AS
A
RESOURCEFUL
MAN
AND
IMO
DECIDED
TO
CHECK
OUT
GRACEFULLY
IF
HE
COULDNT
SUPPORT
HIMSELF
THE
WORST
PART
IS
THAT
JOHN
CAMPBELL
THE
LONGTIME
EDITOR
OF
ASTOUNDINGANALOG
SF
MAGAZINE
HAD
CUT
A
CHECK
FOR
PIPERS
MOST
RECENT
STORY
AND
SAID
CHECK
WAS
IN
THE
MAIL
IF
CAMPBELL
HAD
KNOWN
PIPERS
STRAITS
IM
SURE
HE
WOULD
HAVE
PHONED
TO
SAY
HANG
ON
CAMPBELL
WAS
LIKE
THAT
I
WISH
IT
HAD
HAPPENED
DIFFERENTLY
I
ALWAYS
ENJOYED
PIPERS
STUFF
