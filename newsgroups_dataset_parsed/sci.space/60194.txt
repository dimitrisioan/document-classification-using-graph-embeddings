MARKET
OR
GOV
FAILURES
IN
TOM
WRITES
FRED
SAYING
THAT
GOV
COERCIVE
POSER
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
ANY
SPACE
PROGRAM
I
REPLY
BTW
FRED
YOUVE
REALLY
CROSSED
THE
BORDER
SINCE
YOU
ADMIT
THAT
THE
IDEAS
YOU
SUPPORT
CAN
ONLY
BE
CARRIED
OUT
WITH
COERCIVE
POWER
NOW
THATS
REALLY
FIN
INTOLERANT
SO
GET
OFF
YER
HIGH
HORSE
ABOUT
TOLERANCE
FRED
REPLIES
NO
TOMMY
I
ADMIT
THAT
THERE
ARE
SUCH
THINGS
AS
MARKET
FAILURES
WHICH
NECESSITATE
INTERVENTION
BY
OTHER
THAN
CAPITALIST
FORCES
TO
CORRECT
I
GUESS
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THIS
MARKET
FAILURE
SHOULD
BE
CLASSIFIED
UNDER
PHILS
ECONOMICS
ON
THE
LEVEL
OF
CENTURY
MEDICINE
SINCE
YOU
APPARENTLY
COMPLETELY
IGNORED
THAT
THIS
MARKET
FAILURE
CAN
AS
EASILY
OR
EVEN
MUCH
MORE
EASILY
BE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
FAILURE
SO
IN
ADDITION
TO
A
STRONG
MORAL
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
WHAT
YOU
PROPOSE
THERE
IS
ALSO
A
STRONG
UTILITARIAN
ARGUMENT
NAMELY
THAT
GOVS
DESTRUCTION
OF
WEALTH
THROUGH
CONFISCASTORY
TAXATION
AND
REDISTRIBUTION
ON
A
MAJOR
SCALE
HAS
MADE
SIGNIFICANT
PRIVATE
CAPITAL
INVESTMENTS
HARDER
TO
MAKE
I
NOTE
THAT
YOU
MAKE
NO
SUCH
CASE
AS
YOU
CLAIM
CAN
BE
EVEN
MORE
EASILY
MADE
YES
THE
ARGUMENT
CAN
AND
HAS
BEEN
MADE
THAT
CURRENT
GOVERNMENT
POLICY
CREATES
EVEN
LARGER
MARKET
BARRIERS
THAN
THERE
WERE
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
TERM
AS
GOVERNMENT
FAILURE
SINCE
THE
GOVERNMENT
CAN
CHANGE
POLICIES
WHENEVER
IT
PLEASES
THE
MARKET
DOESNT
DO
THAT
AND
IS
GOVERNED
BY
RELATIVELY
WELLUNDERSTOOD
FORCES
THIS
LIBERTOPICAN
BILGE
ABOUT
MORAL
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
TAXATION
ETC
IS
AT
BOTTOM
SO
MUCH
SIMPLISTIC
ECONOMIC
THINKING
IT
CAN
ONLY
BE
JUSTIFIED
BY
CLICHE
DERISION
OF
ANYONE
WHO
KNOWS
MORE
ABOUT
ECONOMICS
THAN
THE
LIBERTOPIAN
WHICH
IS
WHAT
INVARIABLY
HAPPENS
TRIPE

NEW
LIBERTOPIAN

GO
SALVE

WOUNDED

FRED
THIS
BESIDES
BEING
SIMPLY
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
BE
INSULTING
REALLY
BELONGS
ON

IF
EGOGAMES
ARE
SO
UNIMPORTATNT
TO
YOU
WHY
THE
INSULTS
AND
THIS
STRANGE
NEGATIVE
ATTATCHMENT
FOR
ME
WHEREVER
DO
YOU
GET
THIS
INFLATED
IDEA
OF
YOUR

INSISTING
ON
