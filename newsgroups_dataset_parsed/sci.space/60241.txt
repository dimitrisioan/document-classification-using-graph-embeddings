nasa
wraps
in
the
april
edition
of
one
small
step
for
a
space
activist
allen
sherzer
tim
kyger
write
another
problem
is
what
are
called
wraps
or
sometimes
the
center
tax
when
work
for
a
large
program
like
freedom
or
shuttle
is
performed
at
a
nasa
center
the
center
skims
off
a
portion
which
goes
into
what
amounts
to
a
slush
fund
this
money
is
used
to
fund
work
the
center
manager
wants
to
fund
this
sum
is
estimated
to
be
over
a
third
of
the
funds
allocated
think
about
that
of
the
billion
cost
of
freedom
fully
billion
wont
be
spent
on
anything
having
anything
to
do
with
space
stations
now
maybe
that
billion
was
wisely
spent
and
maybe
it
wasnt
but
the
work
done
with
it
should
stand
on
its
own
merits
not
distorting
the
cost
of
other
projects
congress
has
no
idea
of
the
existense
of
these
wraps
congress
has
never
heard
the
term
center
tax
they
look
at
the
station
they
are
getting
and
the
price
they
are
paying
and
note
that
it
doesnt
add
up
they
wonder
this
blissfully
unaware
that
a
third
of
the
money
is
going
for
something
else
my
dear
friends
your
mixing
fact
and
fiction
here
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
when
i
first
read
this
in
your
posting
i
talked
with
one
of
the
cost
experts
here
in
space
station
at
headquarters
if
you
wondering
why
i
didnt
post
a
response
immediately
i
do
have
a
real
job
im
supposed
to
be
doing
here
at
headquarters
digging
up
old
khz
data
looking
into
sherzerkyger
claims
rates
pretty
low
on
the
totem
pole
of
priority
also
i
spent
last
weekend
in
kansas
city
at
the
national
science
teachers
association
conference
extolling
the
virtues
of
ssf
to
science
teachers
first
off
yes
the
concept
of
center
tax
or
wrap
does
exist
if
i
recall
the
numbers
correctly
the
total
tax
for
the
ssf
program
for
this
fiscal
year
is
around
million
this
was
computed
by
adding
up
the
and
center
taxes
with
the
ssf
budget
for
this
fiscal
year
at
billion
my
calculater
says
the
tax
percentage
is
over
the
life
of
the
ssf
program
using
your
figure
of
billion
for
the
cost
of
ssf
a
tax
at
a
rate
comes
to
million
this
is
alot
less
than
billion
but
i
will
concede
its
still
an
appreciable
amount
of
pocket
change
i
should
note
that
your
estimate
of
the
tax
rate
at
could
be
close
to
the
actual
rate
the
tax
is
only
charged
on
funds
that
are
spent
at
the
center
kind
of
like
mcdonalds
at
some
states
where
you
do
have
to
pay
sales
tax
if
you
eat
the
food
at
the
restaurant
but
you
dont
if
you
get
it
takeout
for
example
at
the
vast
bulk
of
the
funds
we
receive
go
to
the
rocketdyne
contract
and
are
not
subject
to
the
center
tax
i
dont
have
the
numbers
in
front
of
me
but
id
guess
at
least
of
the
funds
go
to
rocketdyne
so
you
could
be
right
about
a
tax
rate
of
but
its
only
applied
to
funds
spent
at
the
center
and
not
to
the
prime
contracts
this
leads
to
the
obvious
question
what
is
the
government
doing
with
ssf
funds
that
dont
go
to
the
prime
contractors
ie
ok
gets
a
slice
of
the
billion
pie
a
big
portion
of
this
slice
goes
to
rocketdyne
what
happens
to
the
balance
of
the
funds
which
arent
eaten
up
by
the
center
tax
at
we
call
these
funds
we
spend
inhouse
supporting
development
funds
as
they
are
supporting
the
development
work
done
by
rocketdyne
we
have
used
these
funds
to
setup
our
own
testbed
to
checkout
the
electrical
power
system
architecture
our
testbed
has
a
real
life
solar
array
field
left
over
from
solar
cell
research
research
a
few
years
back
with
leadacid
car
batteries
to
simulate
the
nickelhydrogen
batteries
on
ssf
dc
switchgear
dcdc
converter
units
and
simulated
loads
data
from
the
testbed
was
used
in
a
recent
change
evaluation
involving
concerns
about
the
stability
of
the
power
system
we
have
also
used
the
supporting
development
money
to
purchase
nickel
hydrogen
batteries
which
are
on
life
testing
at
both
lewis
and
the
crane
naval
facility
in
indiana
as
a
side
point
of
the
battery
cells
on
test
recently
hit
the
four
year
life
test
milestone
cells
have
completed
to
cycles
the
onorbit
batteries
go
through
cycles
per
year
as
a
final
example
my
home
division
at
lewis
used
the
supporting
development
funds
to
purchase
personal
computers
and
work
stations
for
performing
system
analyses
like
modeling
of
the
performance
of
the
electrical
power
system
availability
calculations
using
a
montecarlo
simulation
setting
up
a
database
with
information
on
weight
of
the
power
system
elements
finally
the
money
raised
by
the
tax
does
not
all
go
into
a
slush
fund
at
lewis
the
director
does
control
a
small
discretionary
fund
each
year
any
individual
at
lewis
can
submit
a
proposal
to
the
director
to
get
money
from
this
fund
to
look
at
pretty
much
anything
within
the
lewis
charter
most
of
the
tax
however
goes
to
fund
the
general
services
at
the
center
like
the
library
the
central
computer
services
division
the
contractor
who
removes
the
snow
etc
thus
it
is
rather
difficult
to
determine
what
percentage
of
the
ssf
budget
doesnt
go
for
ssf
activities
to
get
an
accurate
figure
you
would
have
to
take
the
annual
expenditure
for
the
library
for
example
and
then
divide
by
the
amount
of
the
library
funds
used
to
support
ssf
which
would
be
hard
to
compute
by
itself
how
would
you
figure
out
what
percentage
of
the
bill
for
aviation
week
for
year
is
billable
to
ssf
would
you
base
it
on
the
personhours
ssf
employees
spend
reading
avweek
versus
the
rest
of
the
center
personnel
you
would
then
have
to
compare
this
estimate
of
the
ssf
portion
of
the
library
expense
with
the
portion
of
the
tax
that
goes
to
support
the
library
who
knows
maybe
ssf
overpays
on
the
tax
to
run
the
library
but
we
underpay
for
snow
removal
talk
about
a
burecratic
nightmare
my
last
point
is
that
i
cant
believe
your
claim
that
congress
has
never
heard
of
the
term
center
tax
unfortunately
all
of
the
nasa
testimony
before
congress
isnt
on
a
computer
so
i
cant
do
a
simple
word
search
someplace
to
prove
you
wrong
but
surely
in
some
gao
audit
somewhere
these
nasa
cost
methods
were
documented
for
congress
