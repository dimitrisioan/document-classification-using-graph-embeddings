passes
were
performed
over

antennas
and

antennas
respectively
initial
results
indicate
the
delta
dor
pass
on
april
was
unsuccessful
due
to
ground
station
hardware
problems
but
the
one
on
april
was
successfully
performed
on
april
a

the

stored

these
relays
were
commanded
closed
by
the
cds
command
data
subsystem
prior
to
launch
and
were
again
commanded
closed
to
preclude
the
possibility
at

cruise

preliminary
analysis
indicates
the
data
was
received
properly
during
the
period
from
april
to
april
a
navigation
cycle
was
performed
this
navigation
cycle
provided
nearcontinuous
acquisition
of
twoway
doppler
and
ranging
data
during
three
consecutive
passes
of
the
spacecraft
over
and
on
april
realtime
commands
were
sent
to
test
slew
the
radio
relay
antenna
rra
in
preparation
for
the
minisequence
slew
test
on
april
the
rra
was
slewed
from
approximately
degrees
from
stow
to
approximately
degrees
preliminary
analysis
indicated
the
antenna
slewed
to
about
degrees
which
was
well
within
the
predicted
range
the
rra
was
commanded
back
to
approximately
degrees
from
stow
preliminary
analysis
indicated
the
antenna
reached
about
degrees
also
well
within
the
predicted
range
the
rra
motor
temperature
was
at
degree
c
at
the
start
of
the
activity
and
had
increased
to
degrees
c
at
its
completion
after
verifying
proper
rra
slewing
the
rra
slew
test
minisequence
was
uplinked
to
the
spacecraft
for
execution
on
april
upon
successful
uplink
a
delayed
action
command
dac
was
sent
which
will
reposition
the
stator
on
may
to
its
initial
pretest
position
also
a
dac
was
sent
to
turn
the
twoway
noncoherent
twnc
on
april
prior
to
the
start
of
the
rra
slew
test
minisequence
on
april
a
noop
command
was
sent
to
reset
the
command
loss
timer
to
hours
its
planned
value
during
this
mission
phase
on
april
the
rra
slew
test
executed
nominally
the
spacecraft
under
stored
sequence
control
performed
six
rra
slews
starting
at
about
degrees
from
stow
and
going
to
degrees
back
to
degrees
then
to
degrees
back
to
degrees
then
to
degrees
and
then
back
to
degrees
all
of
the
slews
were
well
within
the
predicted
range
the
rra
motor
temperature
was
at
degrees
c
at
the
start
of
the
activity
and
had
increased
to
degrees
c
at
its
completion
after
completion
of
the
rra
slews
realtime
commands
were
sent
to
reconfigure
back
to
the
pretest
configuration
the
acdc

have
not
exhibited
significant

greater
than

throughout
this

the

these
