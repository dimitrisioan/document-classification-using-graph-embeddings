WHAT
IF
THE

GRAYDON
SAUNDRSGQUCDNQUEENSUCA
WRITES
THIS
IS
TURNING
INTO
WHATS
A
MOONBASE
GOOD
FOR
AND
I
OUGHT
NOT
TO
POST
WHEN
IVE
A
HUNDRED
SOME
ODD
POSTS
TO
GO
BUT
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THE
REAL
REASON
TO
HAVE
A
MOON
BASE
IS
ECONOMIC
SINCE
SOMEONE
WITH
SPACE
INDUSTRY
WILL
PRESUMEABLY
HAVE
A
MUCH
LARGER
GNP
THAN
THEY
WOULD
WITHOUT
SPACE
INDUSTRY
EVENTUALLY
THEY
WILL
SIMPLY
BE
ABLE
TO
AFFORD
MORE
STUFF
IF
I
READ
YOU
RIGHT
YOURE
SAYING
IN
ESSENCE
THAT
WITH
A
LARGER
ECONOMY
NATIONS
WILL
HAVE
MORE
DISCRETIONARY
FUNDS
TO
WASTE
ON
A
LUNAR
FACILITY
THAT
WAS
CERTAINLY
PARTIALLY
THE
CASE
WITH
APOLLO
BUT
REAL
LUNAR
COLONIES
WILL
PROBABLY
REQUIRE
A
CONTINUING
MILITARY
SCIENTIFIC
OR
COMMERCIAL
REASON
FOR
BEING
RATHER
THAN
JUST
A
WE
HAVE
THE
MONEY
WHY
NOT
APPROACH
I
WAS
ASSUMING
THAT
THERE
WONT
BE
A
MOON
BASE
UNLESS
IT
MAKES
A
PROFIT
ACTUALLY
IF
IT
DOES
WELL
THAT
GIVES
A
LARGER
GNP
WHICH
LEADS
TO
BEING
ABLE
TO
SPEND
MORE
MONEY
ON
YOUR
MILITARY
INCLUDING
GOSHWOW
SPACE
STUFF
ASSUMING
ITS
PROFITABLE
RATHER
THAN
PAYING
FOR
ITSELF
ITS
CONCEIVABLE
THAT
LUNA
WILL
HAVE
A
MILITARY
PURPOSE
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
LUNA
WILL
HAVE
A
COMMERCIAL
PURPOSE
BUT
ITS
MOST
LIKELY
THAT
LUNA
WILL
ONLY
HAVE
A
SCIENTIFIC
PURPOSE
FOR
THE
NEXT
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
YEARS
AT
LEAST
THEREFORE
LUNAR
BASES
SHOULD
BE
PREDICATED
ON
FUNDING
LEVELS
LITTLE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THOSE
FOUND
FOR
ANTARCTIC
BASES
CAN
YOU
PUT
A
PERSON
BASE
ON
THE
MOON
FOR
MILLION
A
YEAR
EVEN
IF
YOU
USE
GRAD
STUDENTS
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
ONE
FOR
THAT
PUT
IT
THERE
HARDLY
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
AT
LEAST
A
COUPLE
CENTURIES
BEFORE
THERE
WILL
BE
SIGNIFICANT
COMMERICAL
ACTIVITY
ON
THE
MOON
