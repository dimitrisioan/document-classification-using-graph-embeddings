JOSH
HOPKINS
WRITES
IM
WONDERING
IF
VANDALIZE
IS
THE
PROPER
WORD
TO
USE
IN
THIS
SITUATION
MY
DICTIONARY
DEFINES
VANDALISM
AS
THE
WILLFUL
OR
MALICIOUS
DESTRUCTUION
OF
PUBLIC
OR
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
ESPECIALLY
OF
ANYTHING
BEAUTIFUL
OR
ARTISITC
I
WOULD
AGREE
THE
SKY
IS
BEAUTIFUL
BUT
NOT
THAT
IT
IS
PUBLIC
OR
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
ITS
PUBLIC
BECAUSE
IT
BELONGS
TO
EVERYBODY
NO
THE
SKY
DOES
NOT
AT
THIS
TIME
BELONG
TO
ANYONE
OWNERSHIP
IS
NECESSARY
TO
THE
DEFINITION
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
HAS
TO
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
DECIDE
IF
THE
ACTION
WAS
GOOD
OR
BAD
IF
NEITHER
YOU
OR
I
OWN
A
BRICK
WALL
THEN
I
CANT
UNILATERALLY
DECLARE
THAT
SPRAYPAINTING
MY
NAME
ON
IT
IS
RIGHT
AND
YOU
DONT
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
DECLARE
THAT
IT
IS
WRONG
THE
OWNER
MAY
FIND
IT
ARTISTIC
OR
SHE
MAY
BE
CALL
THE
POLICE
THIS
APPLIES
TO
THE
ARGUMENT
ON
BRIGHT
SATELLITES
MORE
THAN
STREET
LIGHTS
ITS
VANDALISM
BECAUSE
MANY
PEOPLE
POWER
COMPANIES
DO
MALICIOUSLY
WASTE
LIGHT
MALICIOUSLY
IMPLIES
EVIL
INTENT
THE
LIGHTING
COMPANIES
ARENT
GOING
OUT
OF
THEIR
WAY
TO
SPOIL
THE
SKY
THEY
JUST
DONT
CARE
IF
THEY
CAN
SELL
YOU
OR
YOUR
CITY
OR
YOUR
STATE
AN
UNSHIELDED
LIGHT
THAT
WASTES
TO
PERCENT
OF
ITS
LIGHT
THEY
MAKE
MORE
MONEY
NEVER
MIND
THAT
YOUR
MONEY
IS
WASTED
IT
IS
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
THE
CUSTOMER
TO
CHOOSE
THE
MOST
EFFICIENT
HARDWARE
IF
THATS
WHAT
YOUR
CITY
WILL
BUY
THATS
WHAT
THE
LIGHTING
COMPANY
WILL
SELL
WRITE
A
LETTER
TO
CITY
HALL
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
IM
NOT
DEFENDING
LIGHT

ORIGNIAL
FOCUS
OF
THIS
THREAD
