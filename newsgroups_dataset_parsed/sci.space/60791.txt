THIS
QUESTION
IS
PROBABLY
MOSTLY
FOR
ALLEN
SHERZER
BUT
ANYONE
WHO
KNOWS
WOULD
BE
WELCOME
TO
ANSWER
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING

WE
COULD
HAVE
SOME
KIND
OF
UPDATE
ON
DCX

ROLLED
OUT
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
AS
WE
SPEAK
IT
IS
AT
WHITE
SANDS
GETTING
READY
I
WOULD
HAVE
CALLED
MY
SOURCES
FOR
THE
LATEST
BUT
THEY
ARE
ALL
OUT
OF
TOWN
IN
NM

FOR
THE
FUTURE

SDIO
HAVE
BEEN
LOOKING
FOR
MORE
FUNDS

DO
SEEM
TO
HAVE
SOME
HOWEVER
SDIO
IS
NOT
I
REPEAT
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
FUND
AN
ORBITAL
PROTOTYPE
THE
BEST
WE
CAN
HOPE
FROM
THEM
IS
TO
KEEP
IT
ALIVE
FOR
ANOTHER
YEAR
AND
FUND
A
SUBORBITAL
VEHICLE
WHICH
MIGHT
WITH
MAJOR
MODIFICATIONS
JUST
MAKE
ORBIT
THERE
IS
ALSO
SOME
MONEY
FOR
A
SET
OF
PROTOTYPE
TANKS
AND
PROJECTS
TO
ANSWER
A
FEW
MORE
OPEN
QUESTIONS
BETTER

FROM
THE
NEW
SPACELIFTER
EFFORT
THE
USAF
MANAGERS
OF
THIS
PROGRAM
ARE
VERY
OPEN
TO
SSTO
AND
WILL
HAVE
ABOUT
NEXT
YEAR
FOR
STUDIES
THIS
WOULD
BE
ENOUGH
TO
BRING
DCY
TO
PDR
NOW
NOT
ALL
OF
THIS
MONEY
WILL
GO
TO
DC
BUT
A
GOOD
CASE
COULD
BE
MADE
FOR
SPENDING
HALF
ON
DC
PUBLIC

IS
STILL
CRITICAL
