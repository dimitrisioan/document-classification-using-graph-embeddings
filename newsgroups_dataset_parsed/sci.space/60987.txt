re
moonbase
race
hmm
billion
lesse
i
can
probably
launch
tons
to
leo
at
million
in
five
years
which
gives
about
tons
to
the
lunar
surface
oneway
say
five
tons
of
that
is
a
return
vehicle
and
its
fuel
a
bigger
mercury
or
something
might
get
that
as
low
as
two
tons
leaving
fifteen
tons
for
a
oneman
habitat
and
a
years
supplies
gee
with
that
sort
of
mass
margins
i
can
build
the
systems
off
the
shelf
for
about
another
hundred
million
tops
that
leaves
about
million
profit
i
like
this
idea
lets
see
if
you
guys
can
push
someone
to
make
it
happen
slightly
seriously
