RE
VANDALIZING
THE
SKY
I
DIDNT
WANT
TO
QUOTE
ALL
THE
STUFF
THATS
BEEN
SAID
RECENTLY
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
ADD
A
POINT
THE
WHOLE
QUESTION
OF
A
RIGHT
TO
A
DARK
SKY
REVOLVES
AROUND
THE
DEFINITION
OF
A
RIGHT
MORAL
RIGHTS
AND
NATURAL
RIGHTS
ARE
ALL
WELL
AND
GOOD
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
A
RIGHT
IS
WHATEVER
YOU
OR
SOMEONE
REPRESENTING
YOU
CAN
ENFORCE
IN
MOST
CIVILIZATIONS
THE
GOVERNMENT
OR
THE
CHURCH
OR
BOTH
DEFINES
WHAT
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THE
CITIZENS
ARE
AND
THEN
ENFORCES
THOSE
RIGHTS
FOR
THEM
HERE
IN
THE
US
THE
CONSTITUTION
PROVIDES
A
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
FROM
WHICH
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
LEGAL
RIGHTS
ARE
CONSIDERED
TO
DERIVE
IM
SURE
THAT
MOST
OTHER
COUNTRIES
HAVE
COMPARABLE
DOCUMENTS
IF
YOU
CAN
PERSUADE
A
COURT
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
A
DARK
SKY
DERIVED
IN
SOME
MANNER
FROM
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
IN
THE
US
YOU
CAN
PREVENT
MAYBE
THESE
BILLBOARDS
FROM
BEING
LAUNCHED
TO
KEEP
ANYONE
IN
THE
WORLD
FROM
LAUNCHING
THEN
GETS
INTO
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
AND
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COURT
OF
JUSTICE
CORRECT
NAME
IN
THE
HAGUE
