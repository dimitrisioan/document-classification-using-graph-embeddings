mark
proposed
this
design
which
he
calls
geode
rough
on
the
outside
but
a
gem
on
the
inside
or
the
et
strongback
with
integrated
hab
modules
and
centrifuge
as
you
can
see
from
file
geodeagif
it
uses
a
space
shuttle
external
tank
et
in
place
of
much
of
the
truss
which
is
currently
part
of
space
station
freedom
the
white
track
on
the
outside
of
the
et
is
used
by
the
station
remonte
manipulator
system
srms
and
by
the
reaction
control
system
rcs
pod
this
allows
the
rcs
pod
to
move
along
the
track
so
that
thrusting
can
occur
near
the
center
of
gravity
cg
of
the
station
as
the
mass
properties
of
the
station
change
during
assembly
the
inline
module
design
allows
the
shuttle
to
dock
more
easily
because
it
can
approach
closer
to
the
stations
cg
and
at
a
structurally
strong
part
of
the
station
in
the
current
ssf
design
docking
forces
are
limited
to
pounds
which
seriously
constrains
the
design
of
the
docking
system
the
et
would
have
a
hatch
installed
preflight
with
little
additional
launch
mass
weve
always
had
the
ability
to
put
an
et
into
orbit
contrary
to
some
rumors
which
have
circulated
here
but
weve
never
had
a
reason
to
do
it
while
we
have
had
some
good
reasons
not
to
performance
penalties
control
debris
generation
and
eventual
deorbit
and
impact
footprint
once
onorbit
we
would
vent
the
residual
the
et
insulation
sofi
either
a
erodes
onorbit
from
impact
with
atomic
oxygen
or
b
stays
where
it
is
and
we
deploy
a
kevlar
sheath
around
it
to
protect
it
and
keep
it
from
contaminating
the
local
space
environment
option
b
has
the
advantage
of
providing
further
micrometeor
protection
the
et
is
incredibly
strong
remember
it
supports
the
whole
stack
during
launch
and
could
serve
as
the
nucleus
for
a
much
more
ambitious
design
as
budget
permits
the
white
module
at
the
end
of
et
contains
a
set
of
control
moment
gyros
to
be
used
for
attitude
control
while
the
rcs
will
be
used
for
gyro
desaturation
the
module
also
contains
a
deorbit
system
which
can
be
used
at
the
end
of
the
stations
life
to
perform
a
controlled
deorbit
so
we
dont
kill
any
more
kangaroos
like
we
did
with
skylab
the
centrifuge
which
has
the
same
volume
as
a
hab
module
could
be
used
for
longterm
studies
of
the
effects
of
lunar
or
martian
gravity
on
humans
the
centrifuge
will
be
used
as
a
momentum
storage
device
for
the
whole
attitude
control
system
the
centrifuge
is
mounted
on
one
of
the
modules
opposite
the
et
and
the
solar
panels
this
design
uses
most
of
the
existing
ssf
designs
for
electrical
data
and
communication
systems
getting
leverage
from
the
ssf
work
done
to
date
mark
proposed
this
design
at
joe
sheas
committee
in
crystal
city
and
he
reports
that
he
was
warmly
received
however
the
rumors
i
hear
say
that
a
design
based
on
a
wingless
space
shuttle
orbiter
seems
more
likely
please
note
that
this
text
is
my
interpretation
of
marks
design
you
should
see
his
notes
in
the
gif
files
instead
of
posting
a
mb
file
to
scispace
i
tried
to
post
these
for
anonftp
in
amesarcnasagov
but
it
was
out
of
storage
space
ill
let
you
all
know
when
i
get
