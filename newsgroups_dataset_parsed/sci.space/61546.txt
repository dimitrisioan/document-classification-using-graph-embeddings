OKAY
WHAT
ABOUT
LAUNCHING
ONE
PROBE
WITH
MULTIPLE
PARTS
KIND
OF
LIEK
THE
OLD
MIRV
PRINCIPLE
OF
OLD
COLD
WAR
DAYS
BASICALLY
WHAT
I
MEAN
IS
DESIGN
A
MOTHER
SHIP
THAT
HAS
PIGGY
BACKED
PROBES
FOR
DIFFERENT
MISSIONSNAMELY
DIFFERENT
PLANETS
EACH
PROBE
WOULD
BE
TIED
IN
WITH
THE
MOTHER
SHIP
OR
EARTH
AS
THE
CASE
MAY
BE
THIS
IS
GOOD
WHEN
AND
IF
WE
GO
FOR
MARS
THE
MARS
MISSION
CAN
ACT
AS
EITHER
MOTHER
SHIP
OR
RELAY
POINT
FOR
THE
PROBES
I
CANT
SEE
THE
NEED
FOR
A
SINGLE
BIG
EXPENSIVE
HEAVY
MOTHERSHIP
EXCEPT
FOR
VOYAGER
STYLE
FLYBY
MISSIONS
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
I
DID
SOME
CALCULATIONS
ON
A
GRAND
TOUR
SPACE
PROBE
LAUNCHED
BY
A
SATURN
V
IN
AT
THE
TIMEI
FELT
THAT
THE
IDEA
OF
A
BIG
MOTHER
SHIP
HAD
SOME
MERIT
THE
VOYAGERS
HAD
TO
BE
RATHER
SMALL
LIGHTWEIGHT
CRAFT
DUE
TO
THE
LIMITATIONS
IMPOSED
BY
USING
WEAK
TITAN
IIICENTAUR
LAUNCHERS
THE
CONCEPT
I
EXAMINED
AND
MICHAELS
HAD
A
LOT
IN
COMMON
WITH
THE
BRITISH
INTERPLANETARY
SOCIETYS
DAEDALUS
PROJECT
FOR
SENDING
A
PROBE
TO
BARNARDS
STAR
IE
A
LARGE
BUS
SPACECRAFT
CARRYING
SEVERAL
SMALLER
PROBES
TO
BE
DISPATCHED
WHEN
THE
SHIP
ARRIVES
AT
ITS
DESTINATION
THE
SATURN
V
SUPPOSEDLY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
LAUNCH
A
PAYLOAD
TOWARDS
JUPITER
AND
BEYOND
THE
BUS
COULD
HAVE
INCLUDED
FAR
MORE
POWERFUL
CAMERASTELESCOPESSCIENTIFIC
EQUIPMENT
AND
A
HEAVIERMORE
POWERFUL
POWER
SOURCE
THAN
THE
VOYAGERS
AS
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
LIMITATIONS
ON
WEIGHT
ANYMORE
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
AS
THE
VOYAGERS
HAD
TO
PERFORM
MOST
OF
THEIR
MEASUREMENTS
WITHIN
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
BEFORE
AND
AFTER
PLANETARY
ENCOUNTER
AND
USUALLY
AT
A
RELATIVELY
GREAT
DISTANCE
THE
SMALLER
PROBES
CARRIED
ABOARD
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
BASED
ON
THE
REAL
VOYAGERS
AND
AN
EVEN
SMALLER
VERSION
LIKE
THE
ONE
SCHEDULED
FOR
LAUNCH
TOWARDS
PLUTO
IN
THE
EARLY
CENTURY
AND
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
RELEASED
AT
VARIOUS
POINTS
DURING
THE
MISSION
THE
ADVANTAGES
ARE
OBVIOUS
THE
BUS
WOULD
HAVE
CARRIED
OUT
THE
SAME
BASIC
JUPITERSATURNURANUSNEPTUNE
MISSION
THAN
VOYAGER
DID
BUT
IN
ADDITION
TWO
SUBPROBES
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
RELASED
AT
SATURN
EXAMINING
THAT
PLANETS
SOUTH
POLAR
REGIONS
BEFORE
MOVING
ON
TO
PLUTO
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
ENABLED
NASA
TO
MAP
BOTH
HEMISPHERES
OF
PLUTOCHARON
BY
SEVERAL
OTHER
PROBES
COULD
HAVE
EXAMINED
PARTS
OF
THE
JUPITERSATURNURANUSNEPTUNE
SYSTEMS
THAT
WERENT
EXAMINED
IN
GREAT
DETAIL
BY
THE
VOYAGERS
DUE
TO
TRAJECTORYRELATED
FACTORS
A
SMALL
SWARM
OF
CAMERAEQUIPPED
MINIATURE
SPACE
PROBES
RELEASED
A
MONTH
BEFORE
ENCOUNTER
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TOO
COSTLY
FOR
A
SMALL
VOYAGERTYPE
MISSION
BUT
ENTIRELY
FEASIBLE
IF
LAUNCHED
FROM
A
HEAVY
WELLEQUIPPED
SPACECRAFT
AND
WOULD
WE
HAVE
LEARNED
A
LOT
MORE
ABOUT
THE
OUTER
PLANETS
THE
REASON
WHY
THE
GRAND
TOUR
WAS
CANCELLED
WAS
LACK
