mariner
the
first
us
attempt
to
send
a
spacecraft
to
venus
failed
minutes
after
launch
in
the
guidance
instructions
from
the
ground
stopped
reaching
the
rocket
due
to
a
problem
with
its
antenna
so
the
onboard
computer
took
control
however
there
turned
out
to
be
a
bug
in
the
guidance
software
and
the
rocket
promptly
went
off
course
so
the
range
safety
officer
destroyed
it
although
the
bug
is
sometimes
claimed
to
have
been
an
incorrect
fortran
do
statement
it
was
actually
a
transcription
error
in
which
the
bar
indicating
smoothing
was
omitted
from
the
expression
rdotbar
sub
n
nth
smoothed
value
of
derivative
of
radius
this
error
led
the
software
to
treat
normal
minor
variations
of
velocity
as
if
they
were
serious
leading
to
incorrect
compensation
mariner
became
the
first
successful
probe
to
flyby
venus
in
december
of
and
it
returned
information
which
confirmed
that
venus
is
a
very
hot
degrees
fahrenheit
now
revised
to
degrees
f
world
with
a
cloudcovered
atmosphere
composed
primarily
of
carbon
dioxide
sulfuric
acid
was
later
confirmed
in
mariner
launched
on
november
was
lost
when
its
protective
shroud
failed
to
eject
as
the
craft
was
placed
into
interplanetary
space
unable
to
collect
the
suns
energy
for
power
from
its
solar
panels
the
probe
soon
died
when
its
batteries
ran
out
and
is
now
in
solar
orbit
it
was
intended
for
a
mars
flyby
with
mariner
mariner
the
sister
probe
to
mariner
did
reach
mars
in
and
took
the
first
closeup
images
of
the
martian
surface
in
all
as
it
flew
by
the
planet
the
probe
found
a
cratered
world
with
an
atmosphere
much
thinner
than
previously
thought
many
scientists
concluded
from
this
preliminary
scan
that
mars
was
a
dead
world
in
both
the
geological
and
biological
sense
mariner
was
sent
to
venus
in
it
reconfirmed
the
data
on
that
planet
collected
five
years
earlier
by
mariner
plus
the
information
that
venus
atmospheric
pressure
at
its
surface
is
at
least
times
that
of
earths
or
the
equivalent
of
being
feet
under
the
surface
of
an
ocean
mariner
and
were
sent
to
mars
in
and
expanded
upon
the
work
done
by
mariner
four
years
earlier
however
they
failed
to
take
away
the
concept
of
mars
as
a
dead
planet
first
made
from
the
basic
measurements
of
mariner
mariner
ended
up
in
the
atlantic
ocean
in
when
the
rocket
launcher
autopilot
failed
mariner
the
sister
probe
to
mariner
became
the
first
craft
to
orbit
mars
in
it
returned
information
on
the
red
planet
that
no
other
probe
had
done
before
revealing
huge
volcanoes
on
the
martian
surface
as
well
as
giant
canyon
systems
and
evidence
that
water
once
flowed
across
the
planet
the
probe
also
took
the
first
detailed
closeup
images
of
mars
two
small
moons
phobos
and
deimos
mariner
used
venus
as
a
gravity
assist
to
mercury
in
the
probe
did
return
the
first
closeup
images
of
the
venusian
atmosphere
in
ultraviolet
revealing
previously
unseen
details
in
the
cloud
cover
plus
the
fact
that
the
entire
cloud
system
circles
the
planet
in
four
earth
days
mariner
eventually
made
three
flybys
of
mercury
from
to
before
running
out
of
attitude
control
gas
the
probe
revealed
mercury
as
a
heavily
cratered
world
with
a
mass
much
greater
than
thought
this
would
seem
to
indicate
that
mercury
has
an
iron
core
which
makes
up
percent
of
the
entire

failed
to
meet
their
main
objective
to
photograph
the

but
they
did
reach
far
enough
into
space
to
provide
new
information
on
the
area
between
earth
and
the
moon
including
new
data
on
the

pioneer
was
a
moon

which
missed
the

and
became
the
first

to
orbit
the
sun
in
pioneer
was
originally
designed
to
flyby
venus
but
the
mission
was
scaled
down
and
it
instead
studied
the
interplanetary
environment
between
venus
and
earth
out
to
million
kilometers
in
a
record
until
mariner
pioneer
through
were
placed
into

still
transmitting

at
this

failed
ranger
lunar
lander
and
impact
missions
ranger
and
were
test
probes
for
the
ranger
lunar
impact
series
they
were
meant
for
high
earth
orbit
testing
in
but
rocket
problems
left
them
in
useless
low
orbits
which
quickly
decayed
ranger
launched
on
january
was
intended
to
land
an
instrument
capsule
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
but
problems
during
the
launch
caused
the
probe
to
miss
the
moon
and
head
into
solar
orbit
ranger
did
try
to
take
some
images
of
the
moon
as
it
flew
by
but
the
camera
was
unfortunately
aimed
at
deep
space
during
the
attempt
ranger
launched
april
had
the
same
purpose
as
ranger
but
suffered
technical
problems
enroute
and
crashed
on
the
lunar
farside
the
first
us
probe
to
reach
the
moon
albeit
without
returning
data
ranger
launched
october
and
similar
to
ranger
and
lost
all
solar
panel
and
battery
power
enroute
and
eventually
missed
the
moon
and
drifted
off
into
solar
orbit
ranger
through
had
more
modified
lunar
missions
they
were
to
send
back
live
images
of
the
lunar
surface
as
they
headed
towards
an
impact
with
the
moon
ranger
failed
this
objective
in
when
its
cameras
did
not
operate
ranger
through
performed
well
becoming
the
first
us
lunar
probes
to
return
thousands
of
lunar
images
through
lunar
orbiter
lunar

lunar
orbiter
through
were
designed
to
orbit
the
moon
and
image
various
sites
being
studied
as
landing
areas
for
the
manned
apollo
missions
of
the
probes
also
contributed
greatly
to
our
understanding
of
lunar
surface
features
particularly
the
lunar
farside
all
five
probes
of
the
series
launched
from
to
were
essentially
successful
in
their
missions
they
were
the
first
us
probes
to
orbit
the
moon
all
los
were
eventually
crashed
into
the
lunar
surface
to
avoid
interference
with
the
manned
apollo
missions
surveyor
lunar
soft
landers
the
surveyor
series
were
designed
primarily
to
see
if
an
apollo
lunar
module
could
land
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
without
sinking
into
the
soil
before
this
time
it
was
feared
by
some
that
the
moon
was
covered
in
great
layers
of
dust
which
would
not
support
a
heavy
landing
vehicle
surveyor
was
successful
in
proving
that
the
lunar
surface
was
strong
enough
to
hold
up
a
spacecraft
from
to
only
surveyor
and
were
unsuccessful
missions
the
rest
became
the
first
us
probes
to
soft
land
on
the
moon
taking
thousands
of
images
and
scooping
the
soil
for
analysis
apollo
landed
feet
from
surveyor
in
and
returned
parts
of
the
craft
to
earth
surveyor
the
last
of
the
series
was
a
purely
scientific
mission
which
explored
the
tycho
crater
region
in
viking
mars
orbiters
and
landers
viking
was
launched
from
cape
canaveral
florida
on
august
on
a
titan
rocket
the
probe
went
into
martian
orbit
on
june
and
the
lander
set
down
on
the
western
slopes
of
chryse
planitia
on
july
it
soon
began
its
programmed
search
for
martian
microorganisms
there
is
still
debate
as
to
whether
the
probes
found
life
there
or
not
and
sent
back
incredible
color
panoramas
of
its
surroundings
one
thing
scientists
learned
was
that
mars
sky
was
pinkish
in
color
not
dark
blue
as
they
originally
thought
the
sky
is
pink
due
to
sunlight
reflecting
off
the
reddish
dust
particles
in
the
thin
atmosphere
the
lander
set
down
among
a
field
of
red
sand
and
boulders
stretching
out
as
far
as
its
cameras
could
image
the
viking
orbiter
kept
functioning
until
august
when
it
ran
out
of
attitudecontrol
propellant
the
lander
was
switched
into
a
weatherreporting
mode
where
it
had
been
hoped
it
would
keep
functioning
through
but
after
november
an
errant
command
had
been
sent
to
the
lander
accidentally
telling
it
to
shut
down
until
further
orders
communication
was
never
regained
again
despite
the
engineers
efforts
through
may
of
an
interesting
side
note
viking
lander
has
been
designated
the
thomas
a
mutch
memorial
station
in
honor
of
the
late
leader
of
the

team
the
national
air
and

museum
in
washington
dc
is
entrusted
with
the
safekeeping
of
the
mutch
station
plaque
until
it
can
be
attached
to
the
lander
by
a
manned
expedition
viking
was
launched
on
september
and
arrived
in
martian
orbit
on
august
the
lander
touched
down
on
september
in
utopia
planitia
it
accomplished
essentially
the
same
tasks
as
its
sister
lander
with
the
exception
that
its
seisometer
worked
recording
one
marsquake
the
orbiter
had
a
series
of
attitudecontrol
gas
leaks
in
which
prompted
it
being
shut
down
that
july
the
lander
was
shut
down
on
april
the
orbits
of
both
viking
orbiters
should
decay
around
voyager
outer
planet
flybys
voyager
was
launched
september
and
flew
past
jupiter
on
march
and
by
saturn
on
november
voyager
was
launched
august
before
voyager
and
flew
by
jupiter
on
august
by
saturn
on
august
by
uranus
on
january
and
by
neptune
on
august
voyager
took
advantage
of
a
rare
alignment
to
slingshot
its
way
from
outer
planet
to
outer
planet
voyager
could
in
principle
have
headed
towards
pluto
but
jpl
opted
for
the
sure
thing
of
a
titan
close
up
between
the
two
probes
our
knowledge
of
the
giant
planets
their
satellites
and
their
rings
has
become
immense
voyager
discovered
that
jupiter
has
complicated
atmospheric
dynamics
lightning
and
aurorae
three
new
satellites
were
discovered
two
of
the
major
surprises
were
that
jupiter
has
rings
and
that
io
has
active
sulfurous
volcanoes
with
major
effects
on
the
jovian
magnetosphere
when
the
two
probes
reached
saturn
they
discovered
over
ringlets
and
satellites
including
the
predicted
shepherd
satellites
that
keep
the
rings
stable
the
weather
was
tame
compared
with
jupiter
massive
jet
streams
with
minimal
variance
a
great
white
spotband
cycle
is
known
titans
atmosphere
was
smoggy
mimas
appearance
was
startling
one
massive
impact
crater
gave
it
the
death
star
appearance
the
big
surprise
here
was
the
stranger
aspects
of
the
rings
braids
kinks
and
spokes
were
both
unexpected
and
difficult
to
explain
voyager
thanks
to
heroic
engineering
and
programming
efforts
continued
the
mission
to
uranus
and
neptune
uranus
itself
was
highly
monochromatic
in
appearance
one
oddity
was
that
its
magnetic
axis
was
found
to
be
highly
skewed
from
the
already
completely
skewed
rotational
axis
giving
uranus
a
peculiar
magnetosphere
icy
channels
were
found
on
ariel
and
miranda
was
a
bizarre
patchwork
of
different
terrains
satellites
and
one
more
ring
were
discovered
in
contrast
to
uranus
neptune
was
found
to
have
rather
active
weather
including
numerous
cloud
features
the
ring
arcs
turned
out
to
be
bright
patches
on
one
ring
two
other
rings
and
other
satellites
were
discovered
neptunes
magnetic
axis
was
also
skewed
triton
had
a
canteloupe
appearance
and
geysers
whats
liquid
at
the
two
voyagers
are
expected
to
last
for
about
two
more
decades
their
ontarget
journeying
gives
negative
evidence
about
possible
planets
beyond
pluto
their
next
major
scientific
discovery
should
be
the
location
of
the
heliopause

been
planned
for
how
the
many
changes
in
the
former
soviet
union
now
the
commonwealth
of
independent
states
will
affect
the
future
of
their
space
program
remains
to
be
seen
japanese
planetary
missions
sakigake
was
launched
from
the
kagoshima
space
center
by
isas
on
january
and
approached
halleys
comet
within
about
million
km
on
march
the
spacecraft
is
carrying
three
instru
ments
to
measure
interplanetary
magnetic
fieldplasma
wavessolar
wind
all
of
which
work
normally
now
so
isas
made
an
earth
swingby
by
sakigake
on
january
into
an
orbit
similar
to
the
earths
the
closest
approach
was
at
on
january
the
geocentric
distance
was
km
this
is
the
first
planetswingby
for
a
japanese
spacecraft
during
the
approach
sakigake
observed
the
geotail
some
geotail
passages
will
be
scheduled
in
some
years
hence
the
second
earthswingby
will
be
on
june
at
re
earths
radius
and
the
third
october
at
re
hiten
a
small
lunar
probe
was
launched
into
earth
orbit
on
january
the
spacecraft
was
then
known
as
musesa
but
was
renamed
to
hiten
once
in
orbit
the
lb
probe
looped
out
from
earth
and
made
its
first
lunary
flyby
on
march
where
it
dropped
off
its
lb
midget
satellite
hagoromo
japan
at
this
point
became
the
third
nation
to
orbit
a
satellite
around
the
moon
joining
the
unites
states
and
ussr
the
smaller
spacecraft
hagoromo
remained
in
orbit
around
the
moon
an
apparently
broken
transistor
radio
caused
the
japanese
space
scientists
to
lose
track
of
it
hagoromos
rocket
motor
fired
on
schedule
on
march
but
the
spacecrafts
tracking
transmitter
failed
immediately
the
rocket
firing
of
hagoromo
was
optically
confirmed
using
the
schmidt
camera
at
the
kiso
observatory
in
japan
hiten
made
multiple
lunar
flybys
at
approximately
monthly
intervals
and
performed
aerobraking
experiments
using
the
earths
atmosphere
hiten
made
a
close
approach
to
the
moon
at
jst
on
february
at
the
height
of
km
from
the
moons
surface
and
fired
its
propulsion
system
for
about
ten
minutes
to
put
the
craft
into
lunar
orbit
the

references
i
also
recommend
reading
the
following
works
categorized
in
three
groups
general
overviews
specific
books
on
particular
space
missions
and
periodical
sources
on
space
probes
this
list
is
by
no
means
complete
it
is
primarily
designed
to
give
you
places
to
start
your
research
through
generally
available
works
on
the
subject
if
anyone
can
add
pertinent
works
to
the
list
it
would
be
greatly
appreciated
though
naturally
i
recommend
all
the
books
listed
below
i
think
it
would
be
best
if
you
started
out
with
the
general
overview
books
in
order
to
give
you
a
clear
idea
of
the
history
of
space
exploration
in
this
area
i
also
recommend
that
you
pick
up
some
good
uptodate
general
works
on
astronomy
and
the
sol
system
to
give
you
some
extra
background

good
luck
with
your
studies
in
this
area
of
space
exploration
i
personally
find
planetary
missions
to
be
one
of
the
more
exciting
areas
in
this
field
and
the
benefits
human
society
has
and
will
receive
from
it
are
incredible
with
many
yet
to
be
realized
