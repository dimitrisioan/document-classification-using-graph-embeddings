what
evidence
is
there
that
there
is
a
trend
towards
greater
species
diversity
over
time
what
i
see
going
on
right
now
is
a
major
extinction
event
and
it
isnt
clear
to
me
that
the
diversity
years
ago
was
necessarily
greater
than
million
years
ago
well
there
are
several
bursts
in
species
diversity
i
can
think
of
the
cambrian
and
ordovician
explosions
resulted
in
a
vast
increase
in
animal
diversity
likewise
after
the
onetwo
punch
of
the
permian
and
triassic
extinctions
the
number
of
marine
animals
rose
steadily
to
an
alltime
high
just
prior
to
the
spread
of
humans
biggest
exception
being
the
kt
bye
bye
dinos
extinction
about
families
also
plants
arose
from
green
algae
and
colonized
the
land
in
succesive
sweeps
mosses
colonized
very
wet
environments
first
ferns
who
had
evolved
vascular
tissues
took
over
more
territory
when
they
evolved
these
were
eventually
mostly
replaced
by
gymnosperms
pines
and
the
like
and
then
mostly
displaced
by
angiosperms
flowering
plants
now
the
dominant
plant
group
on
the
fungi
also
radiated
greatly
with
the
invasion
of
the
land
around
the
carboniferous
up
to
about
families
around
the
triassic
up
to
maybe
families
starting
in
the
cretaceous
rising
to
about
families
currently
its
unclear
to
me
at
least
what
the
max
equilibrium
number
of
species
the
earth
can
hold
and
if
it
has
ever
hit
this
in
the
past
it
could
be
warning
speculation
alert
that
diversity
has
never
reached
a
peak
because
mass
extinctions
happen
often
enough
to
keep
the
total
number
down
this
would
depend
a
great
deal
on
how
fragmented
specific
ecosystems
were
see
cowens
book
history
of
life
for
a
nottootechnical
rundown
on
well
like
the
title
sez
the
history
of
life
or
see
wilsons
diversity
of
life
for
a
view
centered
more
on
current
ecology
this
is
imho
the
best
popular
biology
book
of
what
the
hell
ill
say
it
all
time
