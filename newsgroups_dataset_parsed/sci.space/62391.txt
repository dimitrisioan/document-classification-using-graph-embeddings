WHAT

IS
THERE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
TREND
TOWARDS
GREATER
SPECIES
DIVERSITY
OVER
TIME
WHAT
I
SEE
GOING
ON
RIGHT
NOW
IS
A
MAJOR
EXTINCTION
EVENT
AND
IT
ISNT
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
THE
DIVERSITY
YEARS
AGO
WAS
NECESSARILY
GREATER
THAN
MILLION
YEARS
AGO
WELL
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
BURSTS
IN
SPECIES
DIVERSITY
I
CAN
THINK
OF
THE
CAMBRIAN
AND
ORDOVICIAN
EXPLOSIONS
RESULTED
IN
A
VAST
INCREASE
IN
ANIMAL
DIVERSITY
LIKEWISE
AFTER
THE
ONETWO
PUNCH
OF
THE
PERMIAN
AND
TRIASSIC
EXTINCTIONS
THE
NUMBER
OF
MARINE
ANIMALS
ROSE
STEADILY
TO
AN
ALLTIME
HIGH
JUST
PRIOR
TO
THE
SPREAD
OF
HUMANS
BIGGEST
EXCEPTION

EXTINCTION
ABOUT

AROSE
FROM

OVER

TERRITORY
WHEN
THEY
EVOLVED
THESE
WERE
EVENTUALLY
MOSTLY
REPLACED
BY
GYMNOSPERMS
PINES
AND
THE

AND
THEN
MOSTLY
DISPLACED
BY
ANGIOSPERMS
FLOWERING

NOW
THE

GROUP
ON

ALSO
RADIATED
GREATLY
WITH
THE
INVASION
OF
THE

AROUND
THE

UP
TO
ABOUT
FAMILIES
AROUND
THE
TRIASSIC
UP
TO
MAYBE
FAMILIES
STARTING
IN
THE
CRETACEOUS
RISING
TO
ABOUT
FAMILIES
CURRENTLY
ITS
UNCLEAR
TO
ME
AT
LEAST
WHAT
THE
MAX
EQUILIBRIUM
NUMBER
OF
SPECIES
THE
EARTH
CAN
HOLD
AND
IF
IT
HAS
EVER
HIT
THIS
IN
THE
PAST
IT
COULD
BE
WARNING
SPECULATION
ALERT
THAT
DIVERSITY
HAS
NEVER
REACHED
A
PEAK
BECAUSE
MASS
EXTINCTIONS
HAPPEN
OFTEN
ENOUGH
TO
KEEP
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
DOWN
THIS
WOULD
DEPEND
A
GREAT
DEAL
ON
HOW
FRAGMENTED

ECOSYSTEMS
WERE

SEZ
THE

OR
SEE
WILSONS
DIVERSITY
OF

FOR
A

CENTERED
MORE
ON

THIS
IS
IMHO
THE
