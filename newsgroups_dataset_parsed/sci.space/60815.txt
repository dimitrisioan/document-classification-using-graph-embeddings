RE
BIG
AMATEUR
ROCKETS
LETS
SEE
THESE
ARENT
IN
A
STRICT
SENSE
AMATEUR
ROCKETS
THAT
TERM
DENOTES
ROCKETS
THE
ENGINES
OF
WHICH
ARE
CONSTRUCTED
BY
THE
USER
THE
ROCKETS
YOU
DESCRIBE
ARE
CALLED
HPR
OR
HIGH
POWER
ROCKETS
TO
DISTINGUISH
THEM
FROM
SMALLER
MODEL
ROCKETS
THEY
USE
FACTORYMADE
AMMONIUM
PERCHLORATE
COMPOSITE
PROPELLANTS
IN
PHENOLIC
PLASTIC
ENGINES
WITH
GRAPHITE
NOZZLES
THE
ENGINES
ARE
CLASSIFIED
BY
IMPULSE
A
D
ENGINE
FOR
EXAMPLE
CAN
HAVE
NO
MORE
THAN
NEWTONSECONDS
OF
IMPULSE
AN
F
ENGINE
CAN
HAVE
NO
MORE
THAN
NS
EACH
LETTER
CORRESPONDS
TO
A
DOUBLING
OF
THE
MAXIMUM
IMPULSE
SO
FAR
ENGINES
UP
TO
SIZE
O
ARE
AVAILABLE
PRETTY
MUCH
OFF
THE
SHELF
ENGINES
OF
SIZE
H
AND
ABOVE
ARE
SHIPPED
AS
CLASS
B
EXPLOSIVES
AND
AS
SUCH
ARE
CONTROLLED
ENGINES
OF
SIZE
F
AND
BELOW
ARE
SHIPPED
AS
CLASS
C
EXPLOSIVES
AND
ARE
NOT
AS
CONTROLLED
CLASS
F
ENGINES
BTW
ARE
NOT
HPR
ENGINES
BUT
MODEL
ROCKET
ENGINES
CLASS
G
ENGINES
GO
IN
AND
OUT
OF
LEGAL
LIMBO
THERE
IS
AN
HPR
SOCIETY
THE
TRIPOLI
ROCKET
SOCIETY
I
BELIEVE
WHICH
HOLDS
EVENTS
AT
VARIOUS
SITES
THROUGHOUT
THE
YEAR
WITH
ALL
LEGALITIES
FAA
WAIVER
INCLUDED
TAKEN
CARE
OF
THE
NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION
OF
ROCKETRY
IS
MORE
CONCERNED
WITH
ENGINES
BELOW
H
THOUGH
IT
IS
INVOLVED
IN
HPR
AS
WELL
THESE
SOCIETIES
CERTIFY
USERS
OF
HPR
ROCKETS
AND
COMPANIES
WILL
NOT
SELL
TO
UNCERTIFIED
INDIVIDUALS
BOTTOM
LINE
ITS
LEGIT
I
SUGGEST
YOU
SEND
FOR
A
CATALOG
BUT
FORGET
THE
DYNAMITE
