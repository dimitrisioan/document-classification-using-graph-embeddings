vandalizing

thats
fine
idea
but
it
only
works
if
the
lightingpower
company
even
bothers
to
supply
good
light
fixtures
for
instance
a
power
company
in
virginia
recently
asked
a
state
commission
for
permission
to
sell
more
lights
of
various
type
yet
all
of
the
different
fixture
that
they
sold
and
wanted
to
sell
uh
why
do
they
have
to
ask
a
state
commision
unless
the
states
buying
such
a
process
will
only
increace
the
overhead
to
the
power
company
of
selling
different
types
of
light
and
will
decreace
the
likleihood
that
they
will
do
so
and
any
efficient
lights
they
might
have
been
planning
in
the
future
go
down
the
drain
were
bad
designs
one
that
wasted
the
light
thus
you
couldnt
even
buy
a
good
light
from
them
in
most
places
to
get
a
good
light
you
have
to
either
order
it
special
at
high
cost
or
call
a
store
in
arizona
you
could
order
it
special
if
enough
people
did
so
it
would
be
low
cost
last
i
checked
you
could
use
ups
to
buy
stuff
in
arizona
before
going
there
finally
im
sure
your
state
has
things
like
small
factories
and
machine
shops
you
could
go
into
business
making
lights
that
are
cheaper
to
use
thanks
to
their
higher
efficiency
and
the
fact
that
they
arent
wasting
energy
on
broadcasting
to
space
and
therefore
better
than
the
old
style
at
some
point
society
starts
to
make
rules
cars
have
to
pass
safety
tests
five
year
plans
have
to
be
enacted
or
the
planning
for
the
economy
will
fall
apart
companies
have
to
meet
pollution
standards
etc
as
if
the
clean
air
act
really
cleaned
up
the
air
there
are
two
ways
to
achieve
this
educate
the
public
so
that
they
demand
good
lighting
or
force
code
down
the
lighting
companies
backs
history
seems
to
suggest
that
the
latter
is
more
likely
to
work
my
experience
seems
to
suggest
that
youre
trying
too
hard
to
educate
them
with
the
same
methods
used
in
american
schools
to
make
any
subject
whatsoever
as
relevant
and
boring
as
protougric
instead
of
selling
them
on
the
idea
agreed
so
i
wont
respond
again
its
important
for
all
you
spacers
out
there
to
realize
that
some
people
will
object
to
various
wild
ideas
that
have
been
presented
just
like
congress
it
would
be
best
to
consult
the
astronomerslovers
of
the
night
sky
before
you
try
some
pr
stunt
to
boost
public
knowledge
about
space
well
wake
up
space
is
becoming
a
field
of
human
endeavor
instead
of
just
something
we
can
look
at
from
a
long
long
way
away
there
are
practical
space
projects
that
could
conceivably
although
probably
not
cause
lots
of
light
pollution
and
have
been
argued
against
on
those
grounds
even
though
they
might
open
up
such
possibilities
that
people
could
vacation
on
mars
if
they
wanted
really
dark
skies
