RE
TALKING
TO
BOEING
MANAGEMENT
ABOUT
SSTO
TYPE
STUFF
FROM
A
SHAREHOLDER
PERSPECTIVE
I
MIGHT
SUGGEST
GIVING
THE
MANAGEMENT
SOME
MORE
MUMBLE
TIME
BY
ASKING
THE
VERY
LEADING
QUESTION
IN
TWO
OR
THREE
PARTS
WHAT
ARE
YOUR
LONG
TERM
EXPECTATIONS
OF
SPACE
MARKET
WHAT
PROJECTS
SPECIFICALLY
ARE
THEY
FUNDING
BY
INTERNAL
FUNDS
AND
AT
WHAT
LEVELS
AND
WHAT
COMPETITION
DO
YOU
EXPECT
IN
THIS
AREA
THIS
LAST
POINT
IS
ALWAYS
WORTH
HITTING
UPPER
MANAGEMENT
WITH
GENTLY
IF
YOU
WANT
THEM
TO
THINK
AND
AS
HARD
AS
YOU
CAN
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
GOOD
CASE
THAT
THERE
REALLY
IS
COMPETION
