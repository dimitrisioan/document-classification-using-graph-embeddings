VANDALIZING
THE
SKY
NICHOVNETIBMCOM
GREG
STEWARTNICHOLLS
WRITES
IN
GEORGE
F
KRUMINS
WRITES
IT
IS
SO
TYPICAL
THAT
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THE
MINORITY
ARE
EXTINGUISHED
BY
THE
WANTS
OF
THE
MAJORITY
NO
MATTER
HOW
RIDICULOUS
THOSE
WANTS
MIGHT
BE
UMM
PERHAPS
YOU
COULD
EXPLAIN
WHAT
RIGHTS
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
HERE
GREG
NICHOLLS
VIDI
NICHOVNETIBMCOM
OR
VICI
NICHOOLYMPUSDEMONCOUK
VENI
I
WAS
SUGGESTING
THAT
THE
MINORITY
OF
PROFESSIONAL
AND
AMATEUR
ASTRONOMERS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
A
DARK
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
LET
ME
GIVE
YOU
AN
EXAMPLE
WHEN
YOU
WATCH
TV
THEY
HAVE
COMMERCIALS
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
PROGRAMMING
YOU
ACCEPT
THAT
AS
PART
OF
WATCHING
IF
YOU
DONT
LIKE
IT
YOU
CAN
TURN
IT
OFF
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
VIEW
THE
NIGHT
SKY
AND
THERE
IS
A
FLOATING
BILLBOARD
OUT
THERE
YOU
CANT
TURN
IT
OFF
ITS
THE
SAME
REASONING
THAT
LIMITS
BILLBOARDS
IN
SCENIC
AREAS
PAT
WRITES
GEORGE
ITS
CALLED
A
DEMOCRACY
THE
MAJORITY
RULES
SORRY
IF
YTOU
DONT
LIKE
IT
I
SUGGEST
YOU
MODIFY
THE
CONSTITUTION
TO
INCLUDE
A
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT
TO
DARK
SKIES
THE
THEORY
OF
GOVERNMENT
HERE
IS
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
RULES
EXCEPT
IN
THE
NATURE
OF
FUNDAMENTAL
CIVIL
RIGHTS
I
SAY
ANY
REASONABLY
INDEPTH
PERUSAL
OF
AMERICAN
HISTORY
WILL
SHOW
YOU
THAT
MANY
WASPS
HAVE
CONTINUED
THE
PRACTICES
OF
PREJUDICE
DISCRIMINATION
AND
VIOLENCE
AGAINST
OTHERS
OF
DIFFERENT
RACES
RELIGIONS
AND
BELIEFS
DESPITE
THE
LAW
PAT
SAYS
IF
YOU
REALLY
ARE
ANNOYED
GET
SOME
LEGISLATION
TO
CREATE
A
DARK
SKY
ZONE
WHERE
IN
ALL
LIGHT
EMISSIONS
ARE
PROTECTED
IN
THE
ZONE
KIND
OF
LIKE
THE
NATIONAL
RADIO
QUIET
ZONE
DID
YOU
KNOW
ABOUT
THAT
NEAR
TEH
RADIO
TELESCOPE
OBSERVATORY
IN
WEST
VIRGINIA
THEY
HAVE
A
MILE
EMCON
ZONE
THEORETICALLY
THEY
CAN
PREVENT
YOU
FROM
RUNNING
LIGHT
AC
MOTORS
LIKE
AIR
CONDITIONERS
AND
VACUUMS
IN
PRACTICE
THEY
USE
IT
MOSTLY
TO
CONTROL
LARGE
RADIO
USERS
I
SAY
WHAT
IM
OBJECTING
TO
HERE
IS
A
FLOATING
BILLBOARD
THAT
PRESUMABLY
WOULD
MOVE
AROUND
IN
THE
SKY
I
FOR
ONE
AM
AGAINST
LEGISLATING
AT
ALL
I
JUST
WISH
THAT
PEOPLE
HAD
A
BIT
OF
COMMON
COURTESY
AND
WOULD
CONSIDER
HOW
THEIR
GREED
FOR
MONEY
IMPACTS
THE
MORE
ETHEREAL
AND
AESTHETIC
VALUES
THAT
MAKE
US
HUMAN
THIS
INCLUDES
THE
NEED
FOR
WILD
AND
UNSPOILED
THINGS
INCLUDING
THE
NIGHT
SKY
GEORGE
GEORGE
KRUMINS
THE
SERPENT
AND
THE
RAINBOW
