MY
ADVISOR
ANOTHER
CLASSMATE
OF
MINE
AND
ME
WERE
TALKING
THE
OTHER
DAY
ABOUT
PUTTING
JUST
ONE
DETECTOR
ON
ONE
OF
THE
PLUTO
SATELLITES
THEN
WE
REALIZED
THAT
THE
SATELLITE
ALONE
IS
ONLY
CARRYING
SOMETHING
LIKE
POUNDS
OF
EQ
WELL
A
BATSE
DETECTOR
NEEDS
LEAD
SHIELDING
TO
PROTECT
IT
AND
ALONE
WEIGHS
ABOUT
POUNDS
ITSELF
ACTUALLY
THE
SITUATION
IS
EVEN
WORSE
THAN
THAT
THE
TOTAL
MASS
OF
THE
PLUTO
FAST
FLYBY
SPACECRAFT
IS
ONLY
POUNDS
AND
MOST
OF
THAT
IS
SUPPORT
EQUIPMENT
LIKE
POWER
AND
COMMUNICATIONS
THE
MASS
AVAILABLE
FOR
INSTRUMENTS
IS
MAYBE
OF
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
A
BATSE
WILL
FIT
ACTUALLY
WOULD
YOU
NEED
THE
SHIELDING
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THAT
ITS
MOSTLY
THERE
TO
GIVE
THE
DETECTORS
SOME
DIRECTIONALITY
NO
POINT
IN
DOING
THAT
IF
YOUVE
ONLY
GOT
ONE
IM
SURE
THE
BURST
DETECTORS
THAT
HAVE
FLOWN
ON
OTHER
DEEPSPACE
MISSIONS
HAVENT
WEIGHED
THAT
MUCH
MIND
YOU
THEYRE
PROBABLY
STILL
TOO
HEAVY
THE
PFF
PEOPLE
WOULD
PUT
MORE
PLUTOSPECIFIC
INSTRUMENTS
ON
FIRST
IF
THEY
HAD
ANY
MASS

SPARE
