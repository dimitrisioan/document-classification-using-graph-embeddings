ABOUT
THE

PROPOSALS

INTO

ID
LIKE
TO
ADD
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
PROTESTS
DO
NOT
COME
FROM
A
STRICTLY
PRACTICAL
CONSIDERATION
OF
WHAT
POLLUTION
LEVELS
ARE
ACCEPTABLE
FOR

ACTIVITIES
BY

SOME
OF
WHAT

IS
RIGHT

A

AN
ORBITING
BILLBOARD
WOULD
BE
TRASH
IN

THAT
A
BILLBOARD
ON

BILLBOARDS
MAKE

TRASHY
THAT
IS
WHY
THERE
ARE
LAWS
IN

POLLUTION
COMPLAINTS
ARE
MAINLY
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
FIND
SOME
TANGIBLE
REASON
TO
BE
AGAINST
ORBITING
BILLBOARDS
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
DONT
FEEL
MORALLY
JUSTIFIED
TO
COMPLAIN
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
THESE
THINGS
WOULD
DEFILE
THE
BEAUTY
OF
THE

REGULAR

ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
IN
THIS
RESPECT
SINCE
THEY
ARE
MORE
LIKE
ABSTRACT

BUT
A

IN

WOULD
BE
