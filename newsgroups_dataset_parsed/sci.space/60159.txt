does
anyone
have
any
info
on
the
apparent
sightings
of
vulcan
all
that
i
know
is
that
there
were
apparently
two
sightings
at
drastically
different
times
of
a
small
planet
that
was
inside
mercurys
orbit
beyond
that
i
have
no
other
info
does
anyone
know
anything
more
specific
yes
this
happened
long
before
star
trek
and
is
apparently
where
they
got
the
reference
for
the
guy
with
the
ears
yes
long
before
star
trek
before
einstein
in
fact
vulcan
as
a
planet
inside
mercury
was
hypothesized
to
explain
a
perturbation
of
mercurys
orbit
that
could
not
be
explained
by
the
known
planets
but
einsteins
theory
of
relativity
explained
mercurys
motion
and
analysis
of
mercurys
motion
now
shows
there
are
not
any
planets
inside
its
orbit
