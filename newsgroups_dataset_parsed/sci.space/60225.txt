since
the
dcx
is
to
take
off
horizontal
why
not
land
that
way
why
do
the
martian
landing
thing
or
am
i
missing
something
dont
know
to
much
about
dcx
and
such
overly
obvious
you
missed
something
i
think
it
takes
off
vertically
and
is
intended
to
land
the
same
way
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
