MOST
OF
YOU
AS

I
ARE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
WE
GREW
UP
IN
AN

OF
MIRACLES
INTERCONTINENTAL
BALLISTIC
MISSILES
NUCLEAR
ENERGY
COMPUTERS
FLIGHTS
TO
THE
MOON
BUT
THESE
WERE
MIRACLES
OF
OUR
PARENTS
DOING
FOR
A
DECADE
AND
MORE
THE
PUNDITS

TOLD
US
YOUVE
LOST
IT
THE
ME
GENERATION

ONLY
LIVING
ON
THE
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
OF
THE

DESTINED
TO
REMAIN
GEN
SCHRIEVERS
ICBMS
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
SWELL
WITH
PRIDE
THAT
THE
BEST
NEW
SPACELIFTER
IDEA
IS
TO
REFURBISH
OLD
MINUTEMAN
AND
POSEIDON
BALLISTIC
MISSILES
WELL
THE
PESSIMISTS
ARE
WRONG
THE
LEGACY
IS
CONTINUING
THIS

IS
PROOF
TO
OUR
TECHNOLOGICAL
PARENTS
WEVE
LISTENED
TO
YOUR
STORIES
WEVE
CAUGHT
YOUR
ENTHUSIASM
AND
CANDO
SPIRIT
AND
WEVE
LEARNED
FROM
YOUR
ACHIEVEMENTS
AND
YOUR
MISTAKES
LET

THE
GREATEST

THOR
ICBM
LATER
INCORPORATED
INTO

MOST
SUCCESSFUL

VEHICLE
THE

YOU
TOLD
US
IN
THE
THAT
A
NEW
FORM
OF
LAUNCH
VEHICLE
A
SINGLE
STAGE
REUSABLE
ROCKET
CAN
AND
SHOULD
BE
BUILT
YOU
ADVOCATED
THIS
IDEA
TIRELESSLY
IT
WAS
ELEGANTLY
SIMPLE
AS
ARE
ALL
GREAT
BREAKTHROUGHS
YOU
SHOWED
US
HOW
TO
BUILD
IT
YOU
CONVINCED
US
IT
COULD
BE
DONE
YOU
ARE
WORKING
BY
OUR
SIDE
TO
WELD
ITS
COMPONENTS
INTO
PLACE
MOST
IMPORTANT
YOU
REMINDED
US
OF
A
PRIME
ENGINEERING
PRINCIPLE
UNDOUBTABLY
ONE
YOU
LEARNED
FROM
THE
GENERATION
BEFORE
YOU
THE
GENERATION
THAT
BUILT
TRANSCONTINENTAL
AVIATION
IN
THE
AND
BUILD
A
LITTLE
AND
TEST
A
LITTLE
AND
MAX
YOU
PASSED
ALL
OF
THIS
ON
TO
PEOPLE
LIKE
PAT
LADNER
WHO
STARTED
THIS
PROGRAM
FOR
THE
SDI
DOUGLAS
AIRCRAFT
DIDNT
START
WITH
A
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
START
WITH
A
OUR
GRANDFATHERS
BUILT
A
LITTLE
TESTED
A
LITTLE
EVEN
SOLD
A
LITTLE
AND
MADE
A
LITTLE
MONEY
BEFORE
THEY
MOVED
ON
TO
THE
NEXT
STEP
THEY
DIDNT
TAKE
A
DECADE
OR
MORE
BEFORE
PUTTING
THE
FIRST
RUBBER
ON
THE
ROAD
MAX
HUNTER
YOU
DIDNT
TAKE
TEN
YEARS
TO
BUILD
THOR
AND
BY
GOD
WERE
NOT
GOING
TO
TAKE
TEN
YEARS
TO
SHOW
THAT
LOW
COST
SINGLE
STAGE
REUSABLE
AEROSPACE
TRANSPORTATION
IS
REAL
WE
ENDED
THE
COLD
WAR
IN
A
FEW
SHORT
YEARS
IT
TOOK
THE
SAME
TEAM
HERE
TODAY
BUT
A
FEW
YEARS
TO
SHOW
THROUGH
THE
STRATEGIC
DEFENSE
INITIATIVE
THAT
THE
COLD
WAR
MUST
END
WE
YOU
AND
US
LAUNCHED
A
SERIES
OF
SATELLITES
THE
DELTA
EXPERIMENTS
IN
ABOUT
A
YEAR
APIECE
THIS
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
SIGNALED
OUR
COMMITMENT
TO
END
THE
IMPASSE
BETWEEN
OURSELVES
AND
THE
SOVIET
UNION
THOSE
WHO
MADE
THE
DECISIONS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
HAVE
UNDERSCORED
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
OUR
WORK
IN
BRINGING
ABOUT
A
NEW
INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONSHIP
BUT
IT
IS
THE
SAME
TEAM
WHICH
IS
NOW
PUTTING
IN
PLACE
THE
FRAMEWORK
FOR
AN
AEROSPACE
EXPANSION
THAT
IS
OUR
LEGACY
FOR
THE
NEXT
GENERATION
WE
WILL
MAKE
SPACE
ACCESS
ROUTINE
AND
AFFORDABLE
WE
BUILT
THIS
MAGNIFICENT
FLYING
MACHINE
IN
TWO
YEARS
THIS
SUMMER
A
TRUE
ROCKET
SHIP
WILL
TAKE
OFF
AND
LAND
ON
EARTH
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THEN
WE
CAN
AND
SURELY
WILL
BUILD
IN
THE
NEXT
THREE
YEARS
A
REUSABLE
SUBORBITAL
ROCKET
IT
WILL
ALLOW
US
TO
USE
SPACE
RAPIDLY
AFFORDABLY
AND
EFFICIENTLY
AS
NO
OTHER
NATION
CAN
AND
YES
WELL
MAKE
A
LITTLE
MONEY
OFF
IT
TOO
THEN
AND
ONLY
THEN
WELL
SPEND
ANOTHER
THREE
YEARS
TO
BUILD
A
FULLY
REUSABLE
SINGLE
STAGE
TO
ORBIT
SYSTEM
THE
OF
SPACE
WILL
BE
A
REALITY
WE
MAY
EVEN
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
SOME
OF
THE
ROCKET
PROPULSION
BREAKTHROUGHS
OF
OUR
FORMER
COLD
WAR
ADVERSARIES
WHAT
A
WONDERFUL
IRONY
IF
THIS
SDI
PRODUCT
AND
RUSSIAN
EFFORTS
TO
COUNTER
SDI
MERGE
TO
POWER
MANKINDS
NEXT
STEP
TO
THE
STARS
TO
BE
SURE
WE
MUST
GUARD
AGAINST
THE
TEMPTATIONS
TO
LEAP
TO
THE
FINAL
ANSWER
ROBERT

FIRST
ROCKETS
WERENT
SATURN
VS
IF
WE
SUCCUMB
TO
THE
TEMPTATION
TO
ASK
FOR
JUST
A
FEW
EXTRA
DOLLARS
AND
A
FEW
MORE
YEARS
TO
JUMP
IMMEDIATELY
TO
A
FULL
ORBITAL
SYSTEM
WE
WILL
FAIL
MAX
HUNTER
AND
HIS
COLLEAGUES
SHOWED
THE
WAY
THREE
YEARS
AND
A
CLOUD
OF
DUST
IN
OUR
CASE
ROCKET
EXHAUSTS
THERE
IS
NO
SHORTCUT
IF
WE
EXPECT
TO
RESHAPE
THE
WORLD
AGAIN
WE
MUST
DO
IT
ONE
BRICK
AT
A
TIME
MINDS

THIS
PROJECT
IS
REAL
THE
TORCH
OF
AMERICAN
