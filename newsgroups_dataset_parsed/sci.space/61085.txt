i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
it
is
much
easier
to
place
an
object
at
orbital
altitude
than
it
is
to
place
it
with
orbital
velocity
for
a
target
km
above
the
surface
of
earth
you
need
a
deltav
of
kms
unfortunately
if
you
launch
this
from
the
us
or
are
a
us
citizen
you
will
need
a
launch
permit
from
the
office
of
commercial
space
transportation
and
i
think
it
may
be
difficult
to
get
a
permit
for
an
antisatellite
weapon
well
henry
we
are
often
reminded
how
canada

not
a
part

united
states
yet
you
could
have
quite
a
commercial
asat
er
skycleaning
service
going
in
a
few
years
toronto
skysweepers
