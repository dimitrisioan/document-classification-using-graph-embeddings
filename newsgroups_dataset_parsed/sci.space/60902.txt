ill
visit
the
national
air
and
space
museum
at
the
end
of
the
month
sorry
to
put
a
damper
on
your
plans
but
i
was
there
three
weeks
ago
and
it
wasnt
there
not
that
i
would
have
known
to
look
for
it
of
course
but
i
combed
the
space
exhibits
pretty
thoroughly
and
something
like
that
would
have
caught
my
attention
instantly
it
wasnt
especially
prominent

no
longer

most
museums

it

display
at
once
and
does
rotate
the
displays
occasionally
