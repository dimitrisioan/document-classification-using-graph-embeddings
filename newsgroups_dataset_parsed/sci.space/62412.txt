THIS
IS
A
REAL
WORLD
TOO
YOU
CANT
DO
SCIENCE
LIKE
THIS
WITH
OUT
DOING
POLITICS
AS
WELL
UNFORTUNATELY
GOOD
PR
KEEP
THE
COMING

DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT

NO

OK
SO
YOU
HAVE
PROVEN
YOU
SAW
THE
RIGHT
STUFF
HOWEVER
AS
I
SAID
ABOVE
IT
TAKES
POLITICS

TO
KEEP

I
THINK
YOU
ARE
MISSING
THE
POINT
IF
AN
AGENCY
HAS
GATHERED
SOME
DATA
ON
SOMETHING
AND
ONCE
TAX
DOLLARS
HAVE
BEEN
SPENT
THE
DATA
IS
NOW
PROPERTY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
THE
GOVERNMENT
MAY
CHARGE
TO
RECOVER
SOME
OF
THE
COST
OR
THEY
MAY
CHARGE
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
DATA
BUT
THEY
CANNOT
CLAIM
THE
DATA
IS
PROPRIETARY
UNLESS
IT
IS
CLASSIFIED
NATIONAL
SECURITY
DATA
YES
THIS
MAY
BE
TRUE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
SCIENCE
DATA
COMING
FROM
THE
SPACECRAFT
AND
OTHER
STUFF
ABOUT
THE
OPERATIONS
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
STILL
STUFF
REGARDING
REGULAR
OPERATION
THAT
BELONGS
TO
THE
COMPANY
AND
THEY
HAVE
EVER
LEGAL
RIGHT
TO
KEEPING
IT
THEIRS
BUT
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
EVERYTHING
CAN
OR
SHOULD
BE
SWEPT
UNDER
THE
UMBRELLA
OF
COMPANY
PROPRIETORY
DATA
I
LIVE
DOWN
THE
ROAD
FROM
NIH
THEY
RUN
STUDIES
ALL
THE
TIME
I
CAN
GO
INTO
THEIR
LIBRARY
AND
PHOTOCOPPY
ALL
THE
RAW
DATA
FROM
ANY
STUDY

DONE
JUST
BRING
A
ROLL

DO
THE
SAME
HEREYOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
