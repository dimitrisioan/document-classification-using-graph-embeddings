PAT
PONTIFICATED
I
HEARD
ONCE
THAT
THE
VOYAGERS
HAD
A
FAILSAFE
ROUTINE
BUILT
IN
THAT
ESSENTIALLY
SAYS
IF
YOU
NEVER
HEAR
FROM
EARTH
AGAIN
HERES
WHAT
TO
DO
THIS
WAS
A
BACK
UP
IN
THE
EVENT
A
RECEIVER
BURNT
OUT
BUT
THE
PROBE
COULD
STILL
SEND
DATA
LIMITED
BUT
STILL
SOME
DATA
VOYAGER
HAS
THE
UNUSUAL
LUCK
TO
BE
ON
A
STABLE
TRAJECTORY
OUT
OF
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
ALL
ITS
DOING
IS
COLLECTING
FIELDS
DATA
AND
ROUTINELY
SQUIRTING
IT
DOWN
ONE
OF
THE
MARINERS
IS
ALSO
IN
STABLE
SOLAR
ORBIT
AND
STILL
PROVIDING
SIMILIAR
SOLAR
DATA
SOMETHING
IN
A
PLANETARY
ORBIT
IS
SUBJECT
TO
MUCH
MORE
COMPLEX
FORCES
COMSATS
IN
STABLE
GEOSYNCH
ORBITS
REQUIRE
ALMOST
DAILY
STATIONKEEPING
OPERATIONS
FOR
THE
OCCASIONAL
DEEP
SPACE
BIRD
LIKE
PFF
AFTER
PLUTO
SURE
IT
COULD
BE
LEFT
ON
AUTOPILOT
BUT
THINGS
LIKE
GALILEO
OR
MAGELLAN
ID
SUSPECT
THEY
NEED
ENOUGH
HOUSEKEEPING
THAT
EVEN
UNTENDED
THEYD
END
UP
UNUSABLE
AFTER
A
WHILE
THE
BETTER
QUESTION
SHOULD
BE
WHY
NOT
TRANSFER
OM
OF
ALL
BIRDS
TO
A
SEPARATE
AGENCY
WITH
CONTINOUS
FUNDING
TO
SUPPORT
THESE
KIND
OF
ONGOING
SCIENCE
MISSIONS
PAT
WHEN
ONGOING
OPS
ARE
MENTIONED
IT
SEEMS
TO
ALWAYS
QUOTE
OPERATIONS
AND
DATA
ANALYSIS
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
IT
COST
TO
COLLECT
THE
DATA
AND
LET
IT
BE
ANALYZED
WHENEVER
KINDA
LIKE
ALL
THAT
LANDSAT
DATA
THAT
SAT
AROUND
FOR
YEARS
BEFORE
SOMEONE
ANALYZED
IT
FOR
THE
OZONE
HOLE
EVEN
IF
YOU
LET
TEH
BIRD
DRIFT
IT
MAY
GET
HOSED
BY
SOME
COSMIC
PHENOMENA
SINCE
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
SHUTDOWN
THAT
MAY
NEVER
BE
REFUNDED
FOR
STARTUP
IF
SOME
TYPE
OF
COSMIC
BEM
TOOK
OUT
THE
PROBE
IT
MIGHT
NOT
BE
SUCH
A
BIG
LOSS
OBVIOUSLY
YOU
CANT
PLAN
FOR
EVERYTHING
BUT
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
THINGS
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
