MITCH
WRITES
EFFECT
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
SSRBS
THAT
WAS
RECOVERED
AFTER
THE
RECENT
SPACE
SHUTTLE
LAUNCH
WAS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
A
WRENCH
OF
SOME
SORT
RATTLING
AROUND
APPARENTLY
INSIDE
THE
CASE
I
HEARD
A
SIMILAR
STATEMENT
IN
OUR
LOCAL
NEWS
UTAH
TONIGHT
THEY
REFERRED
TO
THE
TOOL
AS
THE
PLIERS
THAT
TOOK
A
RIDE
INTO
SPACE
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
A
THIOKOL
SP
EMPLOYEE
HAD
REPORTED
MISSING
A
TOOL
OF
SOME
KIND
DURING
ASSEMBLY
OF
ONE
SRB
NO
MORE
INFO
AS
TO
THE
LOCATION
IN
THE
SRB
I
AGREE
PRETTY
WEIRD
