i
did
attend
the

in
a
small
conference
room
the
speaker
was
wired
with
a
mike
and
there
were
microphones
on
the
table
for
the
panel
members
to
use
peons
like
me
sat
in
a
foyer
outside
the
conference
room
and
watched
the
presentations
on
closed
circuit
tv
in
general
the
sound
system
was
fair
to
poor
and

lead
the
formal

the
sense
of
running
