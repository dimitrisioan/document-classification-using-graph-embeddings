PAT
WRITES
THE
QUESTION
I
HAVE
ABOUT
THE
PROTON
IS
COULD
IT
BE
HANDLED
AT
ONE
OF
KSCS
SPARE
PADS
WITHOUT
MAJOR
MALFUNCTION
OR
COULD
IT
BE
HANDLED
AT
KOUROU
OR
VANDENBERG
SEEMS
LIKE
A
LOT
OF
TROUBLE
TO
GO
TO
ITS
PROBABLY
BETTER
TO
INVEST
IN
NEWER
LAUNCH
SYSTEMS
I
DONT
THINK
A
BIG
COST
ADVANTAGE
FOR
USING
RUSSIAN
SYSTEMS
WILL
LAST
FOR
VERY
LONG
MAYBE
A
FEW
YEARS
LOCKHEED
WOULD
BE
THE
PLACE
TO
ASK
SINCE
YOU
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
TO
BUY
THE
PROTON
FROM
THEM
THEY
MARKET
THE
PROTON
WORLD
WIDE
EXCEPT
RUSSIA
THEY
SHOULD
KNOW
A
LOT
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITIES
I
HAVENT
HEARD
THEM
PROPOSE
US
LAUNCHES
SO
I
ASSUME
THEY
LOOKED
INTO
IT
AND
FOUND
IT
UNPROFITABLE
NOW
IF
IT
USES
STORABLES
YES
THEN
HOW
LONG
WOULD
IT
TAKE
FOR
THE
RUSSIANS
TO
EQUIP
SOMETHING
AT
CAPE
YORK
COMPARABLE
TO
THE
ZENIT
I
SUPPOSE
BUT
SINCE
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
NOTHING
WILL
BE
BUILT
THERE
YOU
MIGHT
JUST
AS
WELL
PICK
ANY
SPOT
THE
MESSAGE
IS
TO
LAUNCH
NOW
WHILE
ITS
CHEAP
AND
WHILE
RUSSIA
AND
KAZAKSTAN
ARE
STILL
COOPERATING
LATER
THE
STORY
MAY
BE
DIFFERENT
