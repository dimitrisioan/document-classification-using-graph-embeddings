I
DONT
CARE
WHO
TOLD
YOU
THIS
IT
IS
NOT
GENERALLY
TRUE
I
SEE
EVERY
SINGLE
LINE
ITEM
ON
A
CONTRACT
AND
I
HAVE
TO
SIGN
IT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
WRAP
AT
THIS
UNIVERSITY
DENNIS
I
HAVE
WORKED
ON
OR
WRITTEN
PROPOSALS
WORTH
TENS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
CUSTOMERS
INCLUDED
GOVERNMENT
INCLUDING
NASA
FOR
PROFIT
AND
NONPROFIT
COMPANIES
ALL
EXPECTED
A
WRAP
USUALLY
CALLED
A
FEE
MUCH
OF
THE
WORK
INVOLVED
ALLOCATING
AND
COSTING
THE
WORK
OF
SUBCONTRACTORS
THE
SUBCONTRACTORS
WHERE
UNIVERSITIES
FORPROFITS
NONPROFITS
AND
EVEN
SOME
OF
THE
NASA
CENTERS
FOR
THE
COMMERCIALIZATION
OF
SPACE
ALL
CHARGED
FEES
AS
PART
OF
THE
WORK
DOWN
THE
STREET
IS
ONE
OF
THE
NASA
COMMERCIALIZATION
CENTERS
THEY
CHARGE
A
FEE
YOU
TOTALLY
FORGOT
THE
ORIGINAL
POST
THAT
YOU
POSTED
ALLEN
IN
THAT
POST
YOU
STATED
THAT
THE
WRAP
WAS
ON
TOP
OF
AND
IN
ADDITION
TO
ANY
OVERHEAD
GEEZ
IN
THIS
POST
YOU
FINALLY
ADMIT
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
NOW
IM
SURE
YOUR
A
COMPETENT
ENGINEER
DENNIS
BUT
YOU
CLEARLY
LACK
EXPERIENCE
IN
SEVERAL
AREAS
YOUR
POSTS
SHOW
THAT
YOU
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
INTEGRATION
IN
LARGE
PROJECTS
YOU
ALSO
SHOW
A
LACK
OF
UNDERSTANDING
OF
COSTING
EFFORTS
AS
SHOWN
BY
YOUR
BELIEF
THAT
IT
IS
REASONABLE
TO
CHARGE
INCREMENTAL
COSTS
FOR
EVERYTHING
THIS
ISNT
A
FLAME
JSUT
A
STATEMENT
COME
YOUR
LITTLE
OL
BUNS
DOWN
HERE
AND
YOU
WILL
FIND
OUT
WHO
IS
DOING
WHAT
AND
WHO
IS
WORKING
ON
INTEGRATION
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
AN
AD
HOMINUM
ATTACK
AND
YOU
KNOW
IT
YOUR
EMPLOYER
DOES
CHARGE
A
FEE
YOU
MAY
NOT
SEE
IT
BUT
YOU
DO
OF
COURSE
THERE
IS
A
FEE
IT
IS
FOR
ADMINISTRATION
GEEZ
ALLEN
ANY
ORGANIZATION
HAS
COSTS
BUT
THERE
IS
A
HECK
OF
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
LEGITIMATE
COSTS
SUCH
AS
LIBRARIES
AND
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
MUST
BE
THERE
TO
SUPPORT
A
PROGRAM
AND
WRAP
AS
YOU
ORIGINALLY
STATED
ITYOU
STATED
THAT
WRAP
WAS
ON
TOP
OF
ALL
OF
THE
OVERHEAD
WHICH
A
COUPLE
OF
SENTENCES
DOWN
YOU
SAY
IS
NOT
TRUE
WHICH
IS
IT
ALLEN
SOUNDS
LIKE
THEY
ARE
ADDING
IT
TO
THEIR
OVERHEAD
RATE
GO
ASK
YOUR
COSTING
PEOPLE
HOW
MUCH
FEE
THEY
ADD
TO
A
PROJECT
I
DID
THEY
NEVER
HEARD
OF
IT
BUT
SUGGEST
THAT
LIKE
OUR
PRESIDENT
DID
THAT
ANY
PERCENTAGE
NUMBER
LIKE
THIS
IS
INCLUDED
IN
THE
OVERHEAD
WELL
THERE
YOU
ARE
DENNIS
AS
I
SAID
THEY
SIMPLY
INCLUDE
THE
FEE
IN
THEIR
OVERHEAD
MANY
SEOPARATE
THE
FEE
SINCE
THE
FEE
STRUCTURE
CAN
CHANGE
DEPENDING
ON
THE
CUSTOMER
AS
YOU
HAVE
POSTED
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
ALLEN
YOU
STATE
THAT
WRAP
IS
OVER
AND
ABOVE
OVERHEAD
AND
IS
A
SEPERATE
CHARGE
YOU
ADMIT
HERE
THAT
THIS
IS
WRONG
NASA
HAS
A
LINE
ITEM
BUDGET
EVERY
YEAR
I
HAVE
SEEN
IT
ALLEN
GET
SOME
NUMBERS
FROM
THAT
DETAILED
NASA
BUDGET
AND
DIG
OUT
THE
WRAP
NUMBERS
AND
THEN
HOWL
TO
HIGH
HEAVEN
ABOUT
IT
UNTIL
YOU
DO
THAT
YOU
ARE
BARKING
IN
THE
WIND
NO
ALLEN
YOU
DID
NOT
YOU
MERELY
REPEATED
ALLEGATIONS
MADE
BY
AN
EMPLOYEE
OF
THE
OVERHEAD
CAPITAL
OF
NASA
INTEGRATION
DENNIS
ISNT
OVERHEAD
NOTHING
THAT
RESTON
DOES
COULD
NOT
BE
DONT
BETTER
OR
CHEAPER
AT
THE
OTHER
NASA
CENTERS
WHERE
THE
WORK
IS
GOING
ON
INTEGRATION
COULD
BE
DONE
BETTER
AT
THE
CENTERS
APOLLO
INTEGRATION
WAS
DONE
HERE
AT
MSFC
AND
THAT
DID
NOT
TURN
OUT
SO
BAD
THE
PHILOSOPHY
OF
RESTON
IS
TOTALLY
WRONG
ALLEN
THERE
YOU
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
COMPLETELY
REMOVED
FROM
THE
WORK
THAT
THEY
ARE
TRYING
TO
OVERSEE
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
THAT
WILL
EVER
WORK
IT
HAS
NEVER
WORKED
IN
ANY
LARGE
SCALE
PROJECT
THAT
IT
WAS
EVER
TRIED
ON
COULD
YOU
IMAGINE
A
RESTON
LIKE
SET
UP
FOR
APOLLO
DENNIS
RESTON
HAS
BEEN
THE
ONLY
NASA
AGENCY
WORKING
TO
REDUCE
COSTS
WHEN
WP
WAS
HEMORAGING
OUT
A
BILLION
THE
CENTERS
YOU
LOVE
SO
MUCH
WHERE
DOING
THEIR
BEST
TO
COVER
IT
UP
AND
IGNORE
THE
PROBLEM
RESTON
WAS
THE
ONLY
PLACE
YOU
WOULD
FIND
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
INTERESTED
IN
SOLVING
THE
PROBLEMS
AND
BUILDING
A
STATION
OH
YOU
ARE
FULL
OF
IT
ALLEN
ON
THIS
ONE
I
AGREE
THAT
JSC
SCREWED
UP
BIG
THEY
SHOULD
BE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THAT
SCREW
UP
AND
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
CAUSED
IT
REPLACED
TO
MAKE
A
STUPID
STATEMENT
LIKE
THAT
JUST
SHOWS
HOW
DEEP
YOUR
BIAS
GOES
COME
TO
MSFC
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
AND
YOU
WILL
FIND
OUT
JUST
HOW
WRONG
YOU
REALLY
ARE
MAYBE
NOT
PEOPLE
LIKE
YOU
BELIEVE
EXACTLY
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
BELIEVE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
FACTS
ARE
CONTRARY
TO
IT
KINDA
FUNNY
ISNT
IT
THAT
SOMEONE
WHO
TALKS
ABOUT
A
PROBLEM
LIKE
THIS
IS
AT
A
PLACE
WHERE
EVERYTHING
IS
OVERHEAD
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
A
BIT
MORE
EXPERIENCE
DENNIS
YOU
WILL
REALIZE
THAT
INTEGRATION
ISNT
OVERHEAD
IT
IS
THE
SINGLE
MOST
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
A
SUCCESSFUL
LARGE
SCALE
EFFORT
I
AGREE
THAT
INTEGRATION
IS
THE
SINGLE
MOST
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
A
SUCCESSFUL
LARGE
SCALE
EFFORT
WHAT
I
COMPLETLY
DISAGREE
WITH
IS
SEPERATING
THAT
INTEGRATION
FUNCTION
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
DOING
THE
WORK
IT
IS
CALLED
LEADERSHIP
ALLEN
THAT
IS
WHAT
MADE
APOLLO
WORK
FINAL
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THE
SUCCESS
OF
APOLLO
WAS
HELD
BY
LESS
THAN
PEOPLE
THAT
IS
LEADERSHIP
AND
RESPONSIBILITY
THERE
IS
NEITHER
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
ANY
ORGANIZATION
SET
UP
AS
RESTON
IS
YOU
COULD
TAKE
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
AND
MOVE
THEM
TO
JSC
OR
MSFC
AND
THEY
COULD
DO
A
MUCH
BETTER
JOB
WHY
DID
IT
TAKE
A
YEAR
FOR
RESTON
TO
FINALLY
SAY
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
PROBLEM
IF
THEY
WERE
ON
SITE
AND
PART
OF
THE
PROCESS
THEN
THE
PROBLEM
WOULD
HAVE
NEVER
GOTTEN
OUT
OF
HAND
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THERE
IS
ONE
HECK
OF
A
LOT
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
ALLEN
BUT
ONE
THING
I
DO
KNOW
IS
THAT
FOR
A
PROJECT
TO
BE
SUCCESSFUL
YOU
MUST
HAVE
LEADERSHIP
I
REMEMBER
ALL
OF
THE
TURN
OVER
AT
RESTON
THAT
KEPT
SSF
PROGRAM
IN
SHAMBLES
FOR
YEARS
DO
YOU
IT
IS
LACK
OF
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
LEADERSHIP
THAT
IS
THE
PROGRAMS
PROBLEM
LACK
OF
LEADERSHIP
FROM
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
CONGRESS
AND
AT
RESTON
NASA
IS
ONLY
A
SYMPTOM
OF
A
GREATER
NATIONAL
PROBLEM
YOU
ARE
SO
NARROWLY
FOCUSED
IN
YOUR
EFFORTS
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
SEE
THIS
WHY
DID
THE
SPACE
NEWS
ARTICE
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
CONGRESSIONALLY
DEMANDED
CHANGE
THAT
CAUSED
THE
PROBLEMS
METHINKS
THAT
YOU
ARE
BEING
SELECTIVE
WITH
THE
FACTS
AGAIN
THE
STORY
YOU
REFER
TO
SAID
THAT
SOME
NASA
PEOPLE
BLAMED
IT
ON
CONGRESS
SUPRISE
SUPRISE
THE
FACT
REMAINS
THAT
IT
IS
THE
CENTERS
YOU
SUPPORT
SO
MUCH
WHO
COVERED
UP
THE
OVERHEADS
AND
WOULDNT
ADDRESS
THE
PROBLEMS
UNTIL
THE
PRESS
PUBLISHED
THE
STORY
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THE
RESTON
MANAGERS
WHERE
WRONG
TO
GET
NASA
TO
ADDRESS
THE
OVERRUNS
YOU
APPROVE
OF
WHAT
THE
CENTERS
DID
TO
COVER
UP
THE
OVERRUNS
NO
I
AM
SAYING
THAT
IF
THEY
WERE
LOCATED
AT
JSC
IT
NEVER
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IF
IT
TAKES
FOUR
FLIGHTS
A
YEAR
TO
RESUPPLY
THE
STATION
AND
YOU
HAVE
A
COST
OF
MILLION
A
FLIGHT
THEN
YOU
PAY
BILLION
A
YEAR
YOU
STATED
THAT
YOUR
FRIEND
AT
RESTON
SAID
THAT
WITH
THE
CURRENT
STATION
THEY
COULD
RESUPPLY
IT
FOR
A
BILLION
A
YEAR
IF
THE
WRAP
WERE
GONE
THIS
MERELY
POINTS
OUT
A
BLATENT
CONTRIDICTION
IN
YOUR
NUMBERS
THAT
UNDERSTANDABLY
YOU
FAIL
TO
SEE
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
DENNIS
THAT
NASA
DOESNT
INCLUDE
TRANSPORT
COSTS
FOR
RESUPLY
THAT
COMES
FROM
THE
SHUTTLE
BUDGET
WHAT
THEY
WHERE
SAYING
IS
THAT
OPERATIONAL
COSTS
COULD
BE
CUT
IN
HALF
PLUS
TRANSPORT
SORRY
GANG
BUT
I
HAVE
A
DEADLINE
FOR
A
SATELLITE
SO
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
DO
ALLENS
MATH
FOR
HIM
FOR
A
WHILE
I
WILL
HAVE
LITTLE
CHANCE
TO
DO
SO
I
DO
HOPE
YOU
CAN
FIND
THE
TIME
TO
TELL
US
JUST
WHY
IT
WAS
WRONG
OF
RESTON
TO
ASK
THAT
THE
PROBLEMS
WITH
WP
BE
ADDRESSED
I
HAVE
THE
TIME
TO
REITEREATE
ONE
MORE
TIMET
THAT
IF
THE
LEADERSHIP
THAT
IS
AT
RESTON
WAS
ON
SITE
AT
JSC
THE
PROBLEM
NEVER
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
TOTALLY
IGNORING
THE
LACK
OF
LEADERSHIP
OF
CONGRESS
THIS
MANY
HEADED
HYDRA
THAT
HAS
GROWN
UP
AT
NASA
IS
THE
TRUE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
AGENCY
AND
TO
TRY
TO
CHANGE
THE
QUESTION
TO
SUIT
YOU
AND
YOUR
BIAS
IS
ONLY
INDICATIVE
OF
YOUR
POSITION
