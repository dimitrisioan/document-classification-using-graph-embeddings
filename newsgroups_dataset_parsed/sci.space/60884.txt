THEIR
REPUTATION
AS
CREATORS
OF
SOME
OF
THE
WORST
PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC
SHOWS
IN
TV
HISTORY
BY
FLYING
INTO
INFINITY
THIS
WAS
A
ONEOFF
THING
DONE
AS
PART
OF
BBCS
EDUCATIONAL
SF
SERIES
THE
DAY
AFTER
TOMORROW
THE
ANDERSON
EPISODE
DEALT

THE
FOURMAN
CREW
EVENTUALLY
JOURNEYED
INTO
A
BLACK
HOLE
AND
ENDED
UP
ON
THE
FAR
SIDE
OF
THE
GALAXY
I
THINK
I
SAW
THIS
AS
A
BACK
IN
AND
LIKED
IT
VERY
MUCH
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
I
WAS
A
FAN
OF
SO
I
GUESS
I
WAS
EASILY
SATISFIED
IN
THOSE
DAYS
WOW
I
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
THINK
THAT
I
HAD
MADE
THAT
UP
I
REMEMBER
THAT
MOVIE
IT
WAS
ABOUT
HOURS
LONG
I
DONT
THINK
THEY
ENDED
UP
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
KNOWN
UNIVERSE
I
REMEMBER
THEY
GOT
A
MESSAGE
HALFWAY
OUT
TO
PROXIMA
CENTAURI
THAT
EARTH
TRANSMITTED
A
DAY
AFTER
THEY
LAUNCHED
TIMED
TO
CATCH
UP
WITH
THEM
AT
THE
HALFWAY
POINT
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
NEAT
I
THINK
I
WAS
ALL
OF
AT
THE
TIME
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
INTO
INFINITY
HAS
BEEN
RELEASED
ON

I
HAVE
SOME
SHOWS
ON

AND
KNOW
THAT
THUNDERBIRDS
ETC
ALSO
ARE
AVAILABLE
IN
ENGLAND
HAS
JUST
COME
OUT
WITH
EPISODES
RELEASED
IN
AMERICAN
STORES
I
WILL
LOOK
FOR
THE
INTO
INFINITY
SHOW
I
NEVER
DID
KNOW
THAT
WAS
THE
NAME
OF
IT
I
THOUGHT
THE
SHOW
WAS
CALLED
THE
DAY
AFTER
TOMORROW
AND
THAT
WAS
IT
IF
YOU
