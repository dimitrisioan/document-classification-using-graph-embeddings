if
you
assume
new
launcher
development
with
lower
costs
as
a
specific
objective
then
you
probably
dont
want
to
build
something
hlvsized
anyway
nobody
who
is
interested
in
launching
things
cheaply
will
buy
titans
it
doesnt
take
many
titan

to
pay
for
a
laser
launcher
or
a
large

gun
or
a

program
for
a

booster
all
of
which
would
have
far
