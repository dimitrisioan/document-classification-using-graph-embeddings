we

ken
your
arguments
are
thoughtful
but
you
are
going
up
against
the
big
boys
if
youre
tackling
henry
allen
sherzer
will
doubtless
chime
in
on
the
subject
of
staggering
operational
costs

shuttle
is
the
only
method
in
the
free
world
of
orbiting
large
life
sciences
and
medical
related
packages
ahem
the
russians
are
in
the
free
world
now
or
at
least
it
would
be
politically
correct
to
contend
so
i
am
hopeful
that
dcx
or
whatever
the
followon
is
eventually
called
will
perform
as
you
state
but
right
now
i
must
admit
that
i
am
more
skeptical
than
ever
it
will
be
tough
to
make
dcx
succeed
and
to
turn
it
into
an
operational
orbital
vehicle
doubtless
it
will
fail
to
meet
some
of
the
promised
goals
the
reason
people
are
so
fond
of
it
is
that
its
the
only
chance
we
have
now
or
will
have
for
a
long
time
to
come
to
develop
a
launch
vehicle
with
radically
lower
costs
there
is
no
shuttle
successor
in
funded
development
nasp
is
dwindling
away
and
alsnlsspacelifter
sure
as
hell
arent
gonna
knock
any
zeroes
off
that
per
pound
cost
part
of
the
blame
for
this
must
be
placed
on
a
shuttle
program
that
consumes
many
annual
billions
of
the
er
free
worlds
available
space
cash
as
you
will
no
doubt
hear
from
many
correspondents
in
the
days
to
come
dcx
is
an
attempt
to
break
out
of
the
vicious
cycle
by
keeping
development
costs
low
and
flying
incremental
xplane
hardware
its
been
to
my
mind
incredibly
successful
already
theyve
built
a
complex
prototype
in
under
days
for
under
megabucks
i
would
have
been
extremely
skeptical
that
this
could
be
accomplished
in
america
never
mind
flying
the
thing
getting
a
successor
funded
or
building
the
dcy
im
sure
you
know
well
that
launch
costs
are
the
basic
problem
for
any
expansion
of
astronautics
i
dont
see
a
realistic
prospect
for
beating
down
those
costs
for
multiton
payloads
anywhere
else
if
the
dc
flops
itll
be
business
as
usual
in
space
the
nineties
and
the
doubleoughts
will
look
just
like
the
seventies
and
eighties
a
prospect
too
depressing
to
bear
pegasus
represents
another
assault
on
the
problem
from
a
different
direction
it
doesnt
lower
costperpound
but
it
offers
an
orbital
launch
for
under
ten
megabucks
its
creating
its
own
market
for
small
payloads
i
read
the
magazines
and
ive
attended
the
last
two
iafs
there
are
plenty
of
engineers
with
paper
ideas
for
cheaper
launch
systems
some
of
them
as
good
as
or
better
than
ssto
there
is
no
sign
in
todays
world
that
any
of
these
designs
will
be
allowed
anywhere
near
an
assembly
line
you
could
change
my
view
on
dcx
if
you
could
prove
the
following
deleting
some
things
im
not
going
to
prove
tonight
that
the
shuttle
need
not
go
on
hiatus
to
allow
development
of
a
manratable
dcx
successor
strawman
is
anybody
seriously
proposing
this
references
please
the
dc
must
be
developed
in
the
realworld
funding
climate
which
includes
a
nasa
ferociously
committed
to
continuing
shuttle
operations
as
well
as
the
bird
in
the
hand
argument
your
common
sense
tells
you
if
dcy
flies
at
all
it
flies
alongside
the
shuttle
not
instead
of
it
also
of
course
dcy
and
its
operational
descendants
will
be
useful
for
a
wide
variety
of
jobs
even
if
they
are
not
manrated
most
importantly
that
the
dcx
will
open
up
leo
to
more
scientific
and
technical
payloads
if
a
dcx
successor
can
fly
a
payload
for
or
even
rather
than
the
it
now
costs
more
people
will
be
able
to
afford
more
payloads
for
the
same
money
you
can
fly
several
satellites
instead
of
one
big
outfits
can
fly
multisatellite
series
little
outfits
will
be
able
to
fly
spacecraft
of
their
own
instead
of
begging
a
ride
this
is
just
supply
and
demand
you
should
be
able
to
convince
yourself
that
point
will
be
true
assuming
dc
makes
a
big
difference
in
costs
do
you
have
some
reason
to
think
not
