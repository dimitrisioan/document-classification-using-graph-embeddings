does
anyone
have
a
reference
something
i
can
look
up
not
just
your
own
recollections
i
have
a
few
of
those
myself
on
the
temperature
of
the
night
sky
as
seen
from
space
youll
find
that
in

to
the
accuracy
it
can
be
calculated
see
specific
references
in
allen
about
how
it
is
calculated
the
temperature
is
degrees
k
lots
of
people
have
remarked
on
this
temperature
the
first
may
have
been
in
eddingtons
book
internal
constitution
of
stars
ch
reprinted
where
he
gives
the
temperature
of
space
as
degrees
the
source
of
this
temperature
is
the
radiation
of
starlight
my
dim
recollection
is
that
the
net
effective
temperature
is
substantially
higher
than
that
of
the
mbr
once
you
figure
in
things
like
stars
and
the
zodiacal
light
but
id
like
numbers
to
the
accuracy
of
measurement
its
the
same
temperature
some
of
us
think
this
may
not
be
a
coincidence
