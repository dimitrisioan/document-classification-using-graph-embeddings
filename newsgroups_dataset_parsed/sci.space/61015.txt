has
anyone
looked
into
the
possiblity
of
a
protoncentaur
combo
i
dont
know
a
whole
lot
on
proton
but
given
that
it
is
a
multi
stage
rocket
up
to
stages
it
may
not
really
need
the
centaur
plus
it
may
end
up
seriously
beating
on
said
centaur
the
proton
has
been
used
in
and
stage
versions
the
two
stage
version
was
used
for
the
first
launches
while
the
and
stage
versions
are
used
today
the
four
stage
version
is
used
mostly
for
escape
and
geosynchronous
orbits
while
the
stage
version
is
used
for
low
earth
orbits
since
this
is
the
version
that
launched
mir
and
the
salyuts
and
the
addon
modules
for
mir
as
long
as
centaur
is
smaller
than
mir
which
i
believe
it
is
it
should
fit
under
the
shroud
i
vaguely
recall
that
the
russians
are
developing
a
upper
stage
for
the
proton
