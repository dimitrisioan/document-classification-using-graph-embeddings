it
is
interesting
to
note
in
the
past
few
days
correspondance
that
some
believe
that
poor
old
new
mexico
is
not
capable
of
hosting
a
commercial
space
launch
business
for
many
reasons
it
can
and
we
here
on
the
front
lines
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
the
spaceport
political
publicity
referred
to
the
other
day
had
its
intended
effect
the
state
of
new
mexico
did
establish
the
start
of
the
necessary
government
infrastructure
to
back
a
commercial
space
port
the
commanding
general
at
wsmr
is
in
full
support
of
dualuse
for
the
facilities
the
wsmr
location
also
has
some
strategic
advantages
in
the
form
of
necessary
infrastructure
and
controlled
air
space
to
support
the
project
just
because
the
folks
involved
have
not
done
the
traditional
aerospaceequivalent
of
vaporware
by
inviting
folks
out
to
kick
nonexistent
tires
but
have
been
merely
doing
their
job
to
prepare
for
launch
dont
think
that
nothing
has
happened
from
my
interactions
with
the
macdac
folks
i
get
the
impression
that
they
want
to
set
a
firm
believable
launch
date
based
on
vehicle
readiness
and
not
just
some
fiction
to
plug
a
space
on
a
calendar
i
believe
that
all
will
happen
this
summer
and
dont
worry
the
locals
here
are
planning
to
let
everyone
know
when
it
does
occur
