RE
VANDALIZING
THE
SKY
NICHOVNETIBMCOM
GREG
STEWARTNICHOLLS
WRITES
IN
GEORGE
F
KRUMINS
WRITES
I
WAS
SUGGESTING
THAT
THE
MINORITY
OF
PROFESSIONAL
AND
AMATEUR
ASTRONOMERS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
A
DARK
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
SORRY
YOU
HAVE
A
WISH
FOR
AN
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
BUT
IT
ISNT
A
RIGHT
WHEN
YOU
GET
DOWN
TO
IT
YOU
ACTUALLY
HAVE
NO
RIGHTS
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
HAVENT
AGREED
TO
GIVE
YOU
AND
THEM
IN
THE
PROCESS
ITS
A
COMMON
MISCONCEPTION
THAT
BEING
BORN
SOMEHOW
ENDOWS
YOU
WITH
RIGHTS
TO
THIS
THAT
AND
THE
OTHER
SADLY
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
NOW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
THAT
SHOULD
GO
WITH
THE
POWER
TO
CLUTTER
THE
NIGHT
SKY
THEN
THATS
A
DIFFERENT
MATTER
GREG
NICHOLLS
VIDI
NICHOVNETIBMCOM
OR
VICI
NICHOOLYMPUSDEMONCOUK
VENI
ACCORDING
TO
THIS
REASONING
THERE
ARE
NO
RIGHTS
AT
LEAST
NONE
THAT
I
CAN
THINK
OF
LETS
SEE
DO
I
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
UNPOLLUTED
AIR
NO
BECAUSE
THE
MAJORITY
DRIVE
CARS
AND
USE
GOODS
THAT
CREATE
AIR
POLLUTION
IN
THE
MANUFACTURING
PROCESS
DO
I
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
CLEAN
WATER
I
GUESS
NOT
BY
THE
SAME
REASONING
I
COULD
GO
ON
WITH
THESE
EXAMPLES
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
LOOK
AT
NAZI
GERMANY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
MAJORITY
JEWS
HOMOSEXUALS
BLACKS
AND
OTHERS
THAT
WERE
DIFFERENT
HAD
NO
RIGHTS
IN
FACT
THEY
WERE
TERRORIZED
IMPRISONED
AND
SLAUGHTERED
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
DID
BLACKS
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
BE
FREE
FROM
SLAVERY
I
GUESS
NOT
BECAUSE
THE
MAJORITY
SAID
THAT
SLAVERY
WAS
GOOD
FOR
THEM
I
THINK
THAT
A
RIGHT
HAS
A
MORAL
IMPERATIVE
IF
A
LAW
IMPOSED
BY
THE
MAJORITY
IS
IMMORAL
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
FOLLOW
IT
IN
FACT
ONE
SHOULD
DO
EVERYTHING
IN
HISHER
POWER
TO
STOP
IT
OF
COURSE
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
I
WOULD
LOSE
ALL
COMMON
SENSE
TO
BREAK
THE
LAW
JUST
BECAUSE
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
IMMORAL
I
PAY
MY
FEDERAL
INCOME
TAX
EVEN
THOUGH
I
AM
MORALLY
OPPOSED
TO
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
TAKING
MY
MONEY
AND
SPENDING
IT
ON
WEAPONS
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
AND
TERRORISM
THIS
IS
PRECISELY
THE
POINT
I
AM
TRYING
TO
MAKE
WE
SHOULD
PERSUDE
PEOPLE
BY
LOGIC
POINTING
OUT
THAT
IT
IS
IN
THEIR
SELFINTEREST
TO
LET
ALL
HAVE
EQUAL
RIGHTS
IN
ALL
ASPECTS
OF
LIFE
INCLUDING
ADEQUATE
HOUSING
FOOD
AND
MEDICAL
CARE
I
JUST
HAPPEN
TO
THINK
THAT
FOR
A
FULL
LIFE
THE
AESTHETIC
OF
BEAUTY
AND
JOY
IS
ALSO
NECESSARY
THAT
IS
WHY
I
CONSIDER
AN
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
A
RIGHT
HAVE
YOU
EVER
BEEN
OUT
IN
THE
DESERT
AWAY
FROM
LOCAL
LIGHTS
AND
MOST
PEOPLE
THE
SKY
IS
DARK
AND
TRANSPARENT
THE
MILKY
WAY
IS
ABLAZE
WITH
MORE
DETAIL
THAN
YOU
THOUGHT
POSSIBLE
THE
BEAUTY
AND
WONDER
TAKES
YOUR
BREATH
AWAY
NOW
IMAGINE
YOU
LIVE
IN
THE
WORST
GHETTO
SAY
IN
LA
DUE
TO
LIGHT
POLLUTION
YOU
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
DARK
SKY
YOU
MIGHT
IN
FACT
NEVER
NOT
IN
YOUR
WHOLE
LIFE
EVER
SEE
THE
MAJESTY
OF
THE
NIGHT
SKY
EVERY
WHERE
AROUND
YOU
YOU
SEE
SQUALOR
AND
THROUGH
YOUR
LIFE
RUNS
A
THREAD
OF
DISPAIR
WHAT
IS
THERE
TO
LIVE
FOR
I
ADMIT
THESE
TWO
SCENARIOS
ARE
EXTREME
EXAMPLES
BUT
I
HAVE
SEEN
BOTH
I
FOR
ONE
NEED
DREAMS
AND
HOPES
AND
YES
BEAUTY
AS
A
REASON
FOR
LIVING
THAT
IS
WHY
I
CONSIDER
AN
UNCLUTTERED
NIGHT
SKY
A
RIGHT
