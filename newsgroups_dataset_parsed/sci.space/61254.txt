UPDATE
HAVING
READ
IN
THE
PAST
ABOUT
THE
FAILSAFE
MECHANISMS
ON
SPACECRAFT
I
HAD
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
COMMAND
LOSS
TIMER
HAD
THAT
SORT
OF
FUNCTION
HOWEVER
I
ALWAYS
FIND
DISTURBING
THE
OXYMORON
OF
A
NOOP
COMMAND
THAT
DOES
SOMETHING
IF
THE
COMMAND
CHANGES
THE
BEHAVIOR
OR
STATUS
OF
THE
SPACECRAFT
IT
IS
NOT
A
NOOP
COMMAND
OF
COURSE
THIS
TERMINOLOGY
COMES
FROM
A
JET
PROPULSION
LABORATORY
WHICH
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
JET
PROPULSION
