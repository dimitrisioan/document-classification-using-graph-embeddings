update
having
read
in
the
past
about
the
failsafe
mechanisms
on
spacecraft
i
had
assumed
that
the
command
loss
timer
had
that
sort
of
function
however
i
always
find
disturbing
the
oxymoron
of
a
noop
command
that
does
something
if
the
command
changes
the
behavior
or
status
of
the
spacecraft
it
is
not
a
noop
command
of
course
this
terminology
comes
from
a
jet
propulsion
laboratory
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
jet
propulsion
