if
reboosting
the
hst
by
carrying
it
with
a
shuttle
would
not
damage
it
then
why
couldnt
hst
be
brought
back
to
earth
and
the
repair
job
done
here
im
not
sure
if
this
is
a
big
issue
but
it
seems
to
me
like
it
might
be
up
till
now
all
forces
applied
to
the
mirror
and
its
mounting
and
nearly
all
forces
have
been
applied
along
the
telescopes
optical
axis
and
against
the
mirrors
base
reentry
would
apply
forces
along
roughly
the
same
axis
but
tending
to
pull
the
mirror
away
from
the
mount
and
the
landing
would
apply
onedge
forces
to
both
the
mirror
and
mount
it
could
be
that
one
or
both
of
these
would
not
survive
