STEINLYTOPAZUCSCEDU
STEINN
SIGURDSSON
WRITES
THIS
DOES
NOT
PROPOSE
A
MECHANISM
FOR
GRBS
IN
THE
OORT
AND
NO
ANTIMATTER
ANNIHILATION
DOES
NOT
FIT
THE
SPECTRA
AT
LEAST
AS
FAR
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
ANNIHILATION
SPECTRA
BIG
DIFFERENCE
THATS
IGNORING
THE
QUESTION
OF
HOW
YOU
FIT
A
DISTRIBUTION
TO
THE
OORT
DISTRIBUTION
WHEN
THE
OORT
DISTRIBUTION
IS
NOT
WELL
KNOWN
IN
PARTICULAR
COMET
APHELIA
WHICH
ARE
NOT
WELL
KNOWN
ARE
NOT
A
GOOD
MEASURE
OF
THE
OORT
CLOUD
DISTRIBUTION
MERGING
NEUTRON
STARS
IS
AT
LEAST
A
MECHANISM
WITH
ABOUT
THE
RIGHT
ENERGY
EXCEPT
IT
DOESNT
EXPLAIN
WHY
THERE
IS
NO
APPARENT
CORRELATION
WITH
GALAXIES
OR
GALAXY
STRUCTURE
THERE
IS
NO
MECHANISM
FOR
GETTING
ALL
THE
ENERGY
OUT
IN
GAMMA
RAYS
WITH
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT
OF
BARYONS
AROUND
THERE
WILL
BE
A
LOT
OF
PAIR
PRODUCTION
WHICH
MAKES
A
PLASMA
WHICH
THERMALIZES
THE
ENERGY
IT
HAS
TROUBLE
GENERATING
ENOUGH
ENERGY
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
MOST
POWERFUL
BURSTS
ERGS
IT
HAPPENS
TOO
FAST
COMPARED
TO
THE
BURST
DURATION
AND
IT
IS
HARD
TO
MAKE
TIGHTBINARIES
OF
NEUTRON
STARS
ANOTHER
COSMOLOGICAL
MECHINISM
IS
THE
CATALYTIC
CONVERSION
OF
A
NEUTRON
STAR
TO
A
STRANGE
STAR
OR
THE
MERGER
OF
TWO
STRANGE
STARS
BUT
THAT
USES
PRETTY
FAROUT
PHYSICS
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
WE
DONT
HAVE
A
GOOD
MECHANISM
AT
ANY
DISTANCE
SO
GRBS
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
HAPPENING
BY
AN
UNKNOWN
MECHANISM
SO
WE
CANT
RULE
OUT
THE
OORT
CLOUD
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
SPECTRUM
OF
AN
EVENT
WHICH
CONVERTS
A
COMET
TO
STRANGE
MATTER
THE
SPECTRA
FOR
PRIMORDIAL
BLACK
HOLES
EATING
COMETS
AND
ANTIMATTER
COMETS
COLLIDING
WITH
MATTER
COMETS
ARENT
QUITE
RIGHT
BUT
PERHAPS
THERE
IS
AN
UNUSUAL
MECHANISM
WHICH
MODIFIES
THE
SPECTRUM
THE
ENERGY
MATCHES
VERY
WELL
FOR
BOTH
OF
THESE
MECHANISMS
ACCORDING
TO
TREVOR
WEEKS
IF
THE
TUNGUSKA
METEORITE
WAS
A
MINIBLACK
HOLE
COLLISION
WITH
THE
EARTH
THEN
THERE
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
ENOUGH
MINIBLACK
HOLES
AROUND
THAT
THE
RATE
FOR
BHCOMET
COLLISIONS
MATCHES
THE
GRB
RATE
WELL
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
DONT
KNOW
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
COMETS
IN
THE
OORT
CLOUD
ISNT
A
REASON
TO
RULE
THEM
OUT
IT
MAKES
IT
HARDER
TO
RULE
THEM
OUT
THE
POINT
OF
THE
CITED
PAPER
WAS
THAT
IF
WE
ASSUME
THEY
GOT
THE
RIGHT
DISTRIBUTION
FOR
THE
OORT
CLOUD
IT
IS
HARD
BUT
NOT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
MATCH
THAT
UP
WITH
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
GRBS
IF
THEY
GOT
THE
WRONG
DISTRIBUTION
FOR
THE
OORT
CLOUD
THEY
CANT
CONSTRAIN
ANY
OORT
CLOUD
GRBS
AT
ALL
EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY
WE
DONT
KNOW
ENOUGH
TO
RULE
OUT
OUT
THE
OORT
CLOUD
