RE
WHAT
IF
THE
USSR
HAD
REACHED
THE
MOON

JAMES
THOMAS
GREEN
WRITES
SUPPOSE
THE
SOVIETS
HAD
MANAGED
TO
GET
THEIR
MOON
ROCKET
WORKING
AND
HAD
MADE
IT
FIRST
THEY
COULD
HAVE
BEATEN
US
IF
EITHER
THEIR
ROCKET
HADNT
BLOWN
UP
ON
THE
PAD
THUS
SETTING
THEM
BACK
ANDOR
A
SATURN
V
WENT
BOOM
THE
APOLLO
FIRE
WAS
HARSH
A
SATURN
V
EXPLOSION
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
HURTFUL
BUT
THE
SOVIETS
WINNING
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CRUSHING
THAT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
TECHNOLOGICAL
TURNING
POINT
FOR
THE
US
TURNING
US
FROM
TODAYS
WE
CAN
DO
ANYTHING
WERE
THE
SUPER
POWER
TO
A
MUCH
MORE
RESERVED
ATTITUDE
LIKE
THE
SOVIET
PROGRAM
TODAY
KENNEDY
WAS
GONE
BY
THE
WAR
WAS
STILL
ON
IS
THE
EAST
I
THINK
THE
PROGRAM
WOULD
HAVE
STALLED
BADLY
AND
THE
GOAL
OF
THE
MOON
BY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DEAD
WITH
NASA
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
WERE
THEY
WENT
WRONG
IF
THEY
HAD
BEATEN
US
I
SPECULATE
THAT
THE
US
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
HEAD
AND
DONE
SOME
LANDINGS
BUT
WE
ALSO
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
DETERMINED
TO
SET
UP
A
BASE
BOTH
IN
EARTH
ORBIT
AND
ON
THE
MOON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
WOULD
BE
ON
MARS
BY
NOW
WOULD
DEPEND
UPON
WHETHER
THE
SOVIETS
TRIED
TO
GO
SETTING
UP
A
LUNAR
BASE
WOULD
HAVE
STRETCHED
THE
BUDGETS
OF
BOTH
NATIONS
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THE
MILITARY
VALUE
OF
A
LUNAR
BASE
WOULD
OUTWEIGH
THE
VALUE
OF
GOING
TO
MARS
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
SHORT
RUN
THUS
WE
WOULD
HAVE
CONCENTRATED
ON
THE
MOON
I
SPEULATE
THAT
THE
SATURN
PROGRAM
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PUSHED
INTO
THE
WITH
COST
OVER
RUNS
THAT
WOULD
JUST
BE
TOO
EVIL
NIXON
STILL
WINS
THE
SHUTTLE
WAS
NEVER
PROPOSED
AND
SKYLAB
NEVER
BUILT
BY
THE
PROGRAM
STALLED
YET
AGAIN
UNDER
THE
FUEL
CRISIS
A
STRING
OF
SMALL
LAUNCHES
MARK
THE
MID
SEVENTIES
BY
THE
GOAL
OF
A
US
MAN
ON
THE
MOON
IS
DEAD
AND
THE
US
SPACE
PROGRAM
DRIFTS
TILL
THE
PRESENT
DAY
JAMES

I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
NATION
SHOULD
COMMIT
ITSELF
TO
ACHIEVING
THE
GOAL
BEFORE
THIS
DECADE
IS
OUT
OF
LANDING
A
MAN
ON
THE
MOON
AND
RETURNING
HIM
SAFELY
TO
THE
EARTH
