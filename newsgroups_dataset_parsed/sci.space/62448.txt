WRITES
PHIL
YOUR
POINT
IS
WELL
TAKEN
IT
IS
STILL
A
SAD
IDEA
IM
WORRIED
BY
THE
CONCERN
ABOUT
IT
THOUGH
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
THAT
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
SPACE
ADVERTISING
WHICH
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
IS
PROBABLY
DOOMED
TO
FAIL
ON
FINANCIAL
GROUNDS
AND
IVE
BEEN
READING
AND
AND
WRITING
THIS
THREAD
SINCE
WAY
BACK
WHEN
IT
WAS
ONLY
ON
SCISPACE
FOR
STARTERS
I
DONT
THINK
THE
PIECE
OF
LIGHTPOLLUTION
APPARATUS
WOULD
BE
AS
BRIGHT
AS
THE
FULL
MOON
THAT
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
A
BIT
OF
PROPAGANDA
ON
THE
PART
OF
OPPONENTS
OR
WISHFUL
THINKING
ON
THE
PART
OF
PROPONENTS
SECOND
THIS
CHARGE
OF
RUINING
THE
NIGHT
SKY
PERMANENTLY
HAS
BEEN
LEVELLED
AGAINST
OTHER
PROJECTS
THAT
EITHER
DONT
INCREACE
LIGHT
POLLUTION
SIGNIFICANTLY
OR
INCREACE
LIGHT
POLLUTION
ONLY
OVER
THE
TARGET
AREA
YOU
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
RECOGNIZE
AS
BEING
SOLAR
POWER
SATTELITES
I
THINK
IT
WAS
JOSH
HOPKINS
WHO
ACTUALLY
DID
THE
MATH
SHOWING
THAT
SPSS
WERENT
THAT
BRIGHT
AFTER
ALL
ENDING
SOME
TWO
MONTHS
OF
FRENZIED
OPPOSITION
ON
THE
PART
OF
DARKSKY
ACTIVISTS
AND
VARIOUS
OTHER
TYPES
IS
MAINLY
PROJECTS
LIKE
THE
ORBITING
MIRROR
THE
CIS
TESTED
RECENTLY
WHILE
SLIGHTLY
MORE
WORRISOME
ID
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
SCATTERING
OF
LIGHT
OUTSIDE
THE
TARGET
AREA
FOR
ONE
OF
THESE
MIRRORS
WOULD
BE
WASTED
AS
FAR
AS
THE
PROJECT
WOULD
BE
CONCERNED
AND
SOMETHING
ANY
PROJECT
LIKE
THAT
WOULD
WORK
AGAINST
ANYWAY
AND
GIVEN
SOME
OF
THE
LIKELY
TARGETS
I
DONT
THINK
THERES
GOING
TO
BE
MUCH
OF
AN
OUTCRY
FROM
THE
INHABITANTS
THERE
IS
TOO
MUCH
DARK
SKY
IN
THE
NORTHERN
CIS
DURING
THE
WINTER
AND
I
DOUBT
YOULL
FIND
MANY
ACTIVISTS
IN
MURMANSK
DEMANDING
THE
NATURAL
SKY
BACK
IF
ANYTHING
HELL
PROBABLY
BE
INSIDE
STRIPPED
BUCK
NAKED
IN

SURE
HELL
GET
ENOUGH
VITAMIN

FOR
THE

THE
MIRROR
EXPERIMENTS
ARENT
SOMETHING
THEYRE
DOING
FOR

ADVERTISING
THEY
THINK
THAT
IF
THEY
CAN

ITLL
BE
ONE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
PEOPLE
IN
THE
AFFECTED
AREAS
WILL
THINK
THEY
COULDNT
HAVE
LIVED
WITHOUT
BEFORE
AND
I
DOUBT
ANYONES
GOING
TO
REALLY
BE
ABLE
TO
CONVINCE
THEM
TO
STOP
