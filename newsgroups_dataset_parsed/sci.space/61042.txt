RE
PROTONCENTAUR
WELL
THANK
YOU
DENNIS
FOR
YOUR
AS
USUAL
HIGHLY
DETAILED
AND
INFORMATIVE
POSTING
THE
QUESTION
I
HAVE
ABOUT
THE
PROTON
IS
COULD
IT
BE
HANDLED
AT
ONE
OF
KSCS
SPARE
PADS
WITHOUT
MAJOR
MALFUNCTION
OR
COULD
IT
BE
HANDLED
AT
KOUROU
OR
VANDENBERG
NOW
IF
IT
USES
STORABLES
THEN
HOW
LONG
WOULD
IT
TAKE
FOR
THE
RUSSIANS
TO
EQUIP
SOMETHING
AT
CAPE
YORK
IF
PROTON
WERE
LAUNCHED
FROM
A
WESTERN
SITE
HOW
WOULD
IT
COMPARE
TO
THE
AS
I
SEE
IT
IT
SHOULD
LIFT
VERY
CLOSE
TO
THE
PAT
