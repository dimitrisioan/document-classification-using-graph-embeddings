EFFECT
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
SSRBS
THAT
WAS
RECOVERED
AFTER
THE
RECENT
SPACE
SHUTTLE
LAUNCH
WAS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
A
WRENCH
OF
SOME
SORT
RATTLING
AROUND
APPARENTLY
INSIDE
THE
CASE
I
HEARD
A
SIMILAR
STATEMENT
IN
OUR
LOCAL
NEWS
UTAH
TONIGHT
THEY
REFERRED
TO
THE
TOOL
AS
THE
PLIERS
THAT
TOOK
A
RIDE
INTO
SPACE
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
A
THIOKOL
SP
EMPLOYEE
HAD
REPORTED
MISSING
A
TOOL
OF
SOME
KIND
DURING
ASSEMBLY
OF
ONE
SRB
IT
WAS
A
TEST
OF
THE
FIRST
REUSABLE
TOOL
I
ASSUME
THEN
THAT
SOMEONE
AT
THIOKOL
PUT
ON
THEIR
MANAGERS
HAT
AND
SAID
THAT
PISSING
OFF
THE
CUSTOMER
BY
DELAYING
SHIPMENT
OF
THE
SRB
TO
LOOK
INSIDE
IT
WAS
A
BAD
IDEA
REGARDLESS
OF
WHERE
THAT
TOOL
MIGHT
HAVE
ENDED
UP
WHY
DO
I
GET
THE
FEELING
THAT
THIOKOL
MANAGERS
HATS
ARE
SHAPED
LIKE
CONES
POINTY
SO
THEY
CAN
FIND
THEM
OR
SO
THEY
WILL
STICK
INTO
THEIR
PANTS
BETTER
AND
BE
CLOSER

THEIR
