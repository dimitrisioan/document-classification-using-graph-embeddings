effect
that
one
of
the
ssrbs
that
was
recovered
after
the
recent
space
shuttle
launch
was
found
to
have
a
wrench
of
some
sort
rattling
around
apparently
inside
the
case
i
heard
a
similar
statement
in
our
local
news
utah
tonight
they
referred
to
the
tool
as
the
pliers
that
took
a
ride
into
space
they
also
said
that
a
thiokol
sp
employee
had
reported
missing
a
tool
of
some
kind
during
assembly
of
one
srb
it
was
a
test
of
the
first
reusable
tool
i
assume
then
that
someone
at
thiokol
put
on
their
managers
hat
and
said
that
pissing
off
the
customer
by
delaying
shipment
of
the
srb
to
look
inside
it
was
a
bad
idea
regardless
of
where
that
tool
might
have
ended
up
why
do
i
get
the
feeling
that
thiokol
managers
hats
are
shaped
like
cones
pointy
so
they
can
find
them
or
so
they
will
stick
into
their
pants
better
and
be
closer
to
their
brains
