WHATS
NEW
IN
MY
OPINION
FRIDAY
APRIL
WASHINGTON
DC
NOW
SPACE
MARKETING
IS
WORKING
WITH
UNIVERSITY
OF
COLORADO
AND
LIVERMORE
ENGINEERS
ON
A
PLAN
TO
PLACE
A
MILELONG
INFLATABLE
BILLBOARD
IN
LOWEARTH
ORBIT
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
SOMETHING
LOWELL
WOOD
WOULD
THINK
OF
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
HES
INVOLVED
NO
THE
IDEA
WAS
SUGGESTED
AROUND
HERE
DURING
DISCUSSIONS
OF
POSSIBLE
NEARTERM
COMMERCIAL
SPACE
ACTIVITIES
ONE
OF
THE
FOLKS
INVOLVED
IN
THOSE
DISCUSSIONS
A
SPACECRAFT
ENGINEER
NAMED
PRESTON
CARTER
PASSED
THE
SUGGESTION
ON
TO
SOME
ENTREPRENURIAL
TYPES
AND
MIKE
LAWSON
IS
APPARENTLY
GOING
AHEAD
WITH
IT
PRESTON
IS
NOW
AT
LLNL
AND
IS
WORKING
WITH
SPACE
MARKETING
ON
THE
SENSORS
THAT
MIGHT
BE
CARRIED
NASA
WOULD
PROVIDE
CONTRACTUAL
LAUNCH
SERVICES
HOWEVER
SINCE
NASA
BASES
ITS
CHARGE
ON
SERIOUSLY
FLAWED
COST
ESTIMATES
WN
MAR
THE
TAXPAYERS
WOULD
BEAR
MOST
OF
THE
EXPENSE
ACTUALLY
THAT
SOUNDS
UNLIKELY
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
LAUNCH
VEHICLE
WOULD
BE
BUT
I
WOULD
EXPECT
IT
TO
GO
ON
A
COMMERCIAL
LAUNCHER
CERTAINLY
NOT
ON
THE
SHUTTLE
AND
THE
FRACTION
OF
THE
COST
PAID
TO
NASA
FOR
EG
LAUNCH
SUPPORT
WOULD
PROBABLY
COVER
NASAS
INCREMENTAL
COSTS
PRETTY
WELL
THIS
MAY
LOOK
LIKE
ENVIRONMENTAL
VANDALISM
BUT
MIKE
LAWSON
CEO
OF
SPACE
MARKETING
TOLD
US
YESTERDAY
THAT
THE
REAL
PURPOSE
OF
THE
PROJECT
IS
TO
HELP
THE
ENVIRONMENT
THE
PLATFORM
WILL
CARRY
OZONE
MONITORS
HE
EXPLAINEDADVERTISING
IS
JUST
TO
HELP
DEFRAY
COSTS
THIS
MAY
BE
THE
PURPOSE
FOR
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
COLORADO
PEOPLE
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
THE
PURPOSE
FOR
THE
LIVERMORE
PEOPLE
IS
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
BUILD
LARGE
INFLATABLE
SPACE
STRUCTURES
NO
AS
NOTED
LLNL
IS
INVOLVED
IN
LIGHTWEIGHT
SENSOR
DESIGN
PER
CLEMENTINE
AND
RELATED
PROGRAMS
IM
SURE
FOLKS
AROUND
HERE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
A
DEMONSTRATION
OF
A
MODERN
INFLATABLE
STRUCTURE
BUT
AFTER
ALL
THE
US
DID
THE
ECHO
SATELLITES
LONG
AGO
AND
AN
ADVERTISING
STRUCTURE
WOULD
NOT
BE
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
AN
INFLATABLE
SPACE
STATION
THAN
ECHO
WAS
OR
A
PARADE
BALLOON
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
OF
THIS
REVOLTING
AND
HIDEOUS
ATTEMPT
TO
VANDALIZE
THE
NIGHT
SKY
IT
IS
NOT
EVEN
APRIL
ANYMORE
WHILE
I
HAPPEN
TO
PERSONALLY
DISLIKE
THE
IDEA
MOSTLY
BECAUSE
IVE
GOT
A
BACKGROUND
IN
ASTRONOMY
ITS
HARDLY
VANDALISM
IT
WOULD
BE
A
SHORTLIVED
INTRUSION
ON
THE
NIGHT
SKY
DOING
NO
PERMANENT
DAMAGE
AND
ACTUALLY
HURTING
ONLY
A
SMALL
SUBSET
OF
ASTRONOMERS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IT
WOULD
CERTAINLY
DRAW
ATTENTION
TO
SPACE
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
I
THINK
ITS
A
GREAT
IDEA
LEARNING
HOW
TO
BUILD
STRUCTURES
IN
SPACE
IN
AN
ESSENTIAL
STEP
TOWARDS
SPACE
DEVELOPMENT
WHICH
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
IS
NOT
LIKELY
TO
CONTRIBUTE
MUCH
TO
IF
SUCH
A
PROJECT
ALSO
MONITORS
OZONE
DEPLETION
AND
DEMONSTRATES
CREATIVE
USE
OF
PARTIAL
PRIVATE
SECTOR
FUNDING
IN
THE
PROCESS
SO
MUCH
THE
BETTER
IS
NASA
REALLY
SUPPORTING
THIS
JUNK
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
ITS
A
PURELY
COMMERCIAL
VENTURE
AND
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
MORE
DETAILS
OTHER
THAN
WHAT
WAS
IN
THE
WN
NEWS
BLIP
HOW
SERIOUS
IS
THIS
PROJECT
IS
THIS
JUST
IN
THE
WILD
IDEA
STAGE
OR
DOES
IT
HAVE
REAL
FUNDING
I
GATHER
IT
IS
BEING
VERY
SERIOUSLY
DISCUSSED
WITH
POSSIBLE
ADVERTISERS
COMMERCIAL
PROJECTS
HOWEVER
GENERALLY
DONT
GET
FUNDING
THEY
GET
CUSTOMERS
WHETHER
IT
WILL
HAVE
CUSTOMERS
REMAINS
TO
BE
SEEN
ARE
PROTESTING
GROUPS
BEING
ORGANIZED
IN
THE
STATES
NOT
YET
THOUGH
IF
THIS
PROJECT
GOES
THROUGH
I
SUPPOSE
THE
RETURN
OF
JEREMY

IS
INEVITABLE
NAHH
HES
