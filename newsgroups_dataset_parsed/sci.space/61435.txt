introduction
from
our
small
world
we
have
gazed
upon
the
cosmic
ocean
for
untold
thousands
of
years
ancient
astronomers
observed
points
of
light
that
appeared
to
move
among
the
stars
they
called
these
objects
planets
meaning
wanderers
and
named
them
after
roman
deities
jupiter
king
of
the
gods
mars
the
god
of
war
mercury
messenger
of
the
gods
venus
the
god
of
love
and
beauty
and
saturn
father
of
jupiter
and
god
of
agriculture
the
stargazers
also
observed
comets
with
sparkling
tails
and
meteors
or
shooting
stars
apparently
falling
from
the
sky
science
flourished
during
the
european
renaissance
fundamental
physical
laws
governing
planetary
motion
were
discovered
and
the
orbits
of
the
planets
around
the
sun
were
calculated
in
the
century
astronomers
pointed
a
new
device
called
the
telescope
at
the
heavens
and
made
startling
discoveries
but
the
years
since
have
amounted
to
a
golden
age
of
solar
system
exploration
advancements
in
rocketry
after
world
war
ii
enabled
our
machines
to
break
the
grip
of
earths
gravity
and
travel
to
the
moon
and
to
other
planets
the
united
states
has
sent
automated
spacecraft
then
humancrewed
expeditions
to
explore
the
moon
our
automated
machines
have
orbited
and
landed
on
venus
and
mars
explored
the
suns
environment
observed
comets
and
made
closerange
surveys
while
flying
past
mercury
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
these
travelers
brought
a
quantum
leap
in
our
knowledge
and
understanding
of
the
solar
system
through
the
electronic
sight
and
other
senses
of
our
automated
spacecraft
color
and
complexion
have
been
given
to
worlds
that
for
centuries
appeared
to
earthbound
eyes
as
fuzzy
disks
or
indistinct
points
of
light
and
dozens
of
previously
unknown
objects
have
been
discovered
future
historians
will
likely
view
these
pioneering
flights
through
the
solar
system
as
some
of
the
most
remarkable
achievements
of
the
century
automated
spacecraft
the
national
aeronautics
and
space
administrations
nasas
automated
spacecraft
for
solar
system
exploration
come
in
many
shapes
and
sizes
while
they
are
designed
to
fulfill
separate
and
specific
mission
objectives
the
craft
share
much
in
common
each
spacecraft
consists
of
various
scientific
instruments
selected
for
a
particular
mission
supported
by
basic
subsystems
for
electrical
power
trajectory
and
orientation
control
as
well
as
for
processing
data
and
communicating
with
earth
electrical
power
is
required
to
operate
the
spacecraft
instruments
and
systems
nasa
uses
both
solar
energy
from
arrays
of
photovoltaic
cells
and
small
nuclear
generators
to
power
its
solar
system
missions
rechargeable
batteries
are
employed
for
backup
and
supplemental
power
imagine
that
a
spacecraft
has
successfully
journeyed
millions
of
miles
through
space
to
fly
but
one
time
near
a
planet
only
to
have
its
cameras
and
other
sensing
instruments
pointed
the
wrong
way
as
it
speeds
past
the
target
to
help
prevent
such
a
mishap
a
subsystem
of
small
thrusters
is
used
to
control
spacecraft
the
thrusters
are
linked
with
devices
that
maintain
a
constant
gaze
at
selected
stars
just
as
earths
early
seafarers
used
the
stars
to
navigate
the
oceans
spacecraft
use
stars
to
maintain
their
bearings
in
space
with
the
subsystem
locked
onto
fixed
points
of
reference
flight
controllers
can
keep
a
spacecrafts
scientific
instruments
pointed
at
the
target
body
and
the
crafts
communications
antennas
pointed
toward
earth
the
thrusters
can
also
be
used
to
finetune
the
flight
path
and
speed
of
the
spacecraft
to
ensure
that
a
target
body
is
encountered
at
the
planned
distance
and
on
the
proper
trajectory
between
and
nasa
spacecraft
were
dispatched
to
study
the
moon
and
the
solar
environment
they
also
scanned
the
inner
planets
other
than
earth
mercury
venus
and
mars
these
three
worlds
and
our
own
are
known
as
the
terrestrial
planets
because
they
share
a
solidrock
composition
for
the
early
planetary
reconnaissance
missions
nasa
employed
a
highly
successful
series
of
spacecraft
called
the
mariners
their
flights
helped
shape
the
planning
of
later
missions
between
and
seven
mariner
missions
conducted
the
first
surveys
of
our
planetary
neighbors
in
space
all
of
the
mariners
used
solar
panels
as
their
primary
power
source
the
first
and
the
final
versions
of
the
spacecraft
had
two
wings
covered
with
photovoltaic
cells
other
mariners
were
equipped
with
four
solar
panels
extending
from
their
octagonal
bodies
although
the
mariners
ranged
from
the
mariner
venus
spacecraft
weighing
in
at
kilograms
pounds
to
the
mariner
mars
orbiter
weighing
in
at
kilograms
pounds
their
basic
design
remained
quite
similar
throughout
the
program
the
mariner
venus
spacecraft
for
example
had
originally
been
a
backup
for
the
mariner
mars
flyby
the
mariner
spacecraft
sent
to
venus
and
mercury
used
components
left
over
from
the
mariner
mars
orbiter
program
in
nasa
launched
pioneer
a
jupiter
spacecraft
interest
was
shifting
to
four
of
the
outer
planets
jupiter
saturn
uranus
and
neptune
giant
balls
of
dense
gas
quite
different
from
the
terrestrial
worlds
we
had
already
surveyed
four
nasa
spacecraft
in
all
two
pioneers
and
two
voyagers
were
sent
in
the
to
tour
the
outer
regions
of
our
solar
system
because
of
the
distances
involved
these
travelers
took
anywhere
from
months
to
years
to
reach
their
destinations
barring
faster
spacecraft
they
will
eventually
become
the
first
human
artifacts
to
journey
to
distant
stars
because
the
suns
light
becomes
so
faint
in
the
outer
solar
system
these
travelers
do
not
use
solar
power
but
instead
operate
on
electricity
generated
by
heat
from
the
decay
of
radioisotopes
nasa
also
developed
highly
specialized
spacecraft
to
revisit
our
neighbors
mars
and
venus
in
the
middle
and
late
twin
viking
landers
were
equipped
to
serve
as
seismic
and
weather
stations
and
as
biology
laboratories
two
advanced
orbiters
descendants
of
the
mariner
craft
carried
the
viking
landers
from
earth
and
then
studied
martian
features
from
above
two
drumshaped
pioneer
spacecraft
visited
venus
in
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
was
equipped
with
a
radar
instrument
that
allowed
it
to
see
through
the
planets
dense
cloud
cover
to
study
surface
features
the
pioneer
venus
multiprobe
carried
four
probes
that
were
dropped
through
the
clouds
the
probes
and
the
main
body
all
of
which
contained
scientific
instruments
radioed
information
about
the
planets
atmosphere
during
their
descent
toward
the
surface
a
new
generation
of
automated
spacecraft
including
magellan
galileo
ulysses
mars
observer
the
comet
rendezvousasteroid
flyby
craf
and
cassini
is
being
developed
and
sent
out
into
the
solar
system
to
make
detailed
examinations
that
will
increase
our
understanding
of
our
neighborhood
and
our
own
planet
the
sun
a
discussion
of
the
objects
in
the
solar
system
must
start
with
the
sun
the
sun
dwarfs
the
other
bodies
representing
approximately
percent
of
all
the
mass
in
the
solar
system
all
of
the
planets
moons
asteroids
comets
dust
and
gas
add
up
to
only
about
percent
this
percent
represents
the
material
left
over
from
the
suns
formation
one
hundred
and
nine
earths
would
be
required
to
fit
across
the
suns
disk
and
its
interior
could
hold
over
million
earths
as
a
star
the
sun
generates
energy
through
the
process
of
fusion
the
temperature
at
the
suns
core
is
million
degrees
celsius
million
degrees
fahrenheit
and
the
pressure
there
is
billion
times
earths
air
pressure
at
sea
level
the
suns
surface
temperature
of
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
seems
almost
chilly
compared
to
its
coretemperature
at
the
solar
core
hydrogen
can
fuse
into
helium
producing
energy
the
sun
also
produces
a
strong
magnetic
field
and
streams
of
charged
particles
both
extending
far
beyond
the
planets
the
sun
appears
to
have
been
active
for
billion
years
and
has
enough
fuel
to
go
on
for
another
five
billion
years
or
so
at
the
end
of
its
life
the
sun
will
start
to
fuse
helium
into
heavier
elements
and
begin
to
swell
up
ultimately
growing
so
large
that
it
will
swallow
earth
after
a
billion
years
as
a
red
giant
it
will
suddenly
collapse
into
a
white
dwarf
the
final
end
product
of
a
star
like
ours
it
may
take
a
trillion
years
to
cool
off
completely
many
spacecraft
have
explored
the
suns
environment
but
none
have
gotten
any
closer
to
its
surface
than
approximately
twothirds
of
the
distance
from
earth
to
the
sun
pioneers
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
voyagers
and
and
other
spacecraft
have
all
sampled
the
solar
environment
the
ulysses
spacecraft
launched
on
october
is
a
joint
solar
mission
of
nasa
and
the
european
space
agency
after
using
jupiters
gravity
to
change
its
trajectory
ulysses
will
fly
over
the
suns
polar
regions
during
and
and
will
perform
a
wide
range
of
studies
using
nine
onboard
scientific
instruments
we
are
fortunate
that
the
sun
is
exactly
the
way
it
is
if
it
were
different
in
almost
any
way
life
would
almost
certainly
never
have
developed
on
earth
mercury
obtaining
the
first
closeup
views
of
mercury
was
the
primary
objective
of
the
mariner
spacecraft
launched
on
november
from
kennedy
space
center
in
florida
after
a
journey
of
nearly
five
months
which
included
a
flyby
of
venus
the
spacecraft
passed
within
kilometers
miles
of
the
solar
systems
innermost
planet
on
march
until
mariner
little
was
known
about
mercury
even
the
best
telescopic
views
from
earth
showed
mercury
as
an
indistinct
object
lacking
any
surface
detail
the
planet
is
so
close
to
the
sun
that
it
is
usually
lost
in
solar
glare
when
the
planet
is
visible
on
earths
horizon
just
after
sunset
or
before
dawn
it
is
obscured
by
the
haze
and
dust
in
our
atmosphere
only
radar
telescopes
gave
any
hint
of
mercurys
surface
conditions
prior
to
the
voyage
of
mariner
the
photographs
mariner
radioed
back
to
earth
revealed
an
ancient
heavily
cratered
surface
closely
resembling
our
own
moon
the
pictures
also
showed
huge
cliffs
crisscrossing
the
planet
these
apparently
were
created
when
mercurys
interior
cooled
and
shrank
buckling
the
planets
crust
the
cliffs
are
as
high
as
kilometers
miles
and
as
long
as
kilometers
miles
instruments
on
mariner
discovered
that
mercury
has
a
weak
magnetic
field
and
a
trace
of
atmosphere
a
trillionth
the
density
of
earths
atmosphere
and
composed
chiefly
of
argon
neon
and
helium
when
the
planets
orbit
takes
it
closest
to
the
sun
surface
temperatures
range
from
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
on
mercurys
sunlit
side
to
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
on
the
dark
side
this
range
in
surface
temperature
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
is
the
largest
for
a
single
body
in
the
solar
system
mercury
literally
bakes
and
freezes
at
the
same
time
days
and
nights
are
long
on
mercury
the
combination
of
a
slow
rotation
relative
to
the
stars
earth
days
and
a
rapid
revolution
around
the
sun
earth
days
means
that
one
mercury
solar
day
takes
earth
days
or
two
mercury
years
the
time
it
takes
the
innermost
planet
to
complete
two
orbits
around
the
sun
mercury
appears
to
have
a
crust
of
light
silicate
rock
like
that
of
earth
scientists
believe
mercury
has
a
heavy
ironrich
core
making
up
slightly
less
than
half
of
its
volume
that
would
make
mercurys
core
larger
proportionally
than
the
moons
core
or
those
of
any
of
the
planets
after
the
initial
mercury
encounter
mariner
made
two
additional
flybys
on
september
and
march
before
control
gas
used
to
orient
the
spacecraft
was
exhausted
and
the
mission
was
concluded
each
flyby
took
place
at
the
same
local
mercury
time
when
the
identical
half
of
the
planet
was
illuminated
as
a
result
we
still
have
not
seen
onehalf
of
the
planets
surface
venus
veiled
by
dense
cloud
cover
venus
our
nearest
planetary
neighbor
was
the
first
planet
to
be
explored
the
mariner
spacecraft
launched
on
august
was
the
first
of
more
than
a
dozen
successful
american
and
soviet
missions
to
study
the
mysterious
planet
as
spacecraft
flew
by
or
orbited
venus
plunged
into
the
atmosphere
or
gently
landed
on
venus
surface
romantic
myths
and
speculations
about
our
neighbor
were
laid
to
rest
on
december
mariner
passed
within
kilometers
miles
of
venus
and
became
the
first
spacecraft
to
scan
another
planet
onboard
instruments
measured
venus
for
minutes
mariner
launched
in
june
flew
much
closer
to
the
planet
passing
within
kilometers
miles
of
venus
on
the
second
american
flyby
mariner
instruments
measured
the
planets
magnetic
field
ionosphere
radiation
belts
and
temperatures
on
its
way
to
mercury
mariner
flew
by
venus
and
transmitted
ultraviolet
pictures
to
earth
showing
cloud
circulation
patterns
in
the
venusian
atmosphere
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
two
spacecraft
were
launched
to
further
unravel
the
mysteries
of
venus
on
december
of
the
same
year
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
became
the
first
spacecraft
placed
in
orbit
around
the
planet
five
days
later
the
five
separate
components
making
up
the
second
spacecraft
the
pioneer
venus
multiprobe
entered
the
venusian
atmosphere
at
different
locations
above
the
planet
the
four
small
independent
probes
and
the
main
body
radioed
atmospheric
data
back
to
earth
during
their
descent
toward
the
surface
although
designed
to
examine
the
atmosphere
one
of
the
probes
survived
its
impact
with
the
surface
and
continued
to
transmit
data
for
another
hour
venus
resembles
earth
in
size
physical
composition
and
density
more
closely
than
any
other
known
planet
however
spacecraft
have
discovered
significant
differences
as
well
for
example
venus
rotation
west
to
east
is
retrograde
backward
compared
to
the
easttowest
spin
of
earth
and
most
of
the
other
planets
approximately
percent
of
venus
atmosphere
times
as
dense
as
earths
is
carbon
dioxide
the
principal
constituent
of
earths
atmosphere
is
nitrogen
venus
atmosphere
acts
like
a
greenhouse
permitting
solar
radiation
to
reach
the
surface
but
trapping
the
heat
that
would
ordinarily
be
radiated
back
into
space
as
a
result
the
planets
average
surface
temperature
is
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
hot
enough
to
melt
lead
a
radio
altimeter
on
the
pioneer
venus
orbiter
provided
the
first
means
of
seeing
through
the
planets
dense
cloud
cover
and
determining
surface
features
over
almost
the
entire
planet
nasas
magellan
spacecraft
launched
on
may
has
been
in
orbit
around
venus
since
august
the
spacecraft
uses
radarmapping
techniques
to
provide
ultrahighresolution
images
of
the
surface
magellan
has
revealed
a
landscape
dominated
by
volcanic
features
faults
and
impact
craters
huge
areas
of
the
surface
show
evidence
of
multiple
periods
of
lava
flooding
with
flows
lying
on
top
of
previous
ones
an
elevated
region
named
ishtar
terra
is
a
lavafilled
basin
as
large
as
the
united
states
at
one
end
of
this
plateau
sits
maxwell
montes
a
mountain
the
size
of
mount
everest
scarring
the
mountains
flank
is
a
wide
deep
impact
crater
named
cleopatra
almost
all
features
on
venus
are
named
for
women
maxwell
montes
alpha
regio
and
beta
regio
are
the
exceptions
craters
survive
on
venus
for
perhaps
million
years
because
there
is
no
water
and
very
little
wind
erosion
extensive
faultline
networks
cover
the
planet
probably
the
result
of
the
same
crustal
flexing
that
produces
plate
tectonics
on
earth
but
on
venus
the
surface
temperature
is
sufficient
to
weaken
the
rock
which
cracks
just
about
everywhere
preventing
the
formation
of
major
plates
and
large
earthquake
faults
like
the
san
andreas
fault
in
california
venus
predominant
weather
pattern
is
a
highaltitude
highspeed
circulation
of
clouds
that
contain
sulfuric
acid
at
speeds
reaching
as
high
as
kilometers
miles
per
hour
the
clouds
circle
the
planet
in
only
four
earth
days
the
circulation
is
in
the
same
direction
west
to
east
as
venus
slow
rotation
of
earth
days
whereas
earths
winds
blow
in
both
directions
west
to
east
and
east
to
west
in
six
alternating
bands
venus
atmosphere
serves
as
a
simplified
laboratory
for
the
study
of
our
weather
earth
as
viewed
from
space
our
worlds
distinguishing
characteristics
are
its
blue

masses
and
white

we
are
enveloped
by
an
ocean
of

consisting
of

just
a

our

rapid

give
rise
to
an
extensive

which
along
with
the

shields
us
from
nearly
all
of
the
harmful
radiation
coming
from
the

earths

protects
us
from
meteors
as
well
most
of
which
burn
up
before
they
can

active
geological

have
left
no

of
the

almost
certainly
received
soon
after
it
formed
about
billion
years
ago
along
with
the
other
newly
formed
planets
it
was
showered
by
space
debris
in
the
early
days
of
the
solar
system
from
our
journeys
into
space
we
have
learned
much
about
our
home
planet
the
first
american
satellite
explorer
was
launched
from
cape
canaveral
in
florida
on
january
and
discovered
an
intense
radiation
zone
now
called
the
van
allen
radiation
belts
surrounding
earth
since
then
other
research
satellites
have
revealed
that
our
planets
magnetic
field
is
distorted
into
a
teardrop
shape
by
the
solar
wind
the
stream
of
charged
particles
continuously
ejected
from
the
sun
weve
learned
that
the
magnetic
field
does
not
fade
off
into
space
but
has
definite
boundaries
and
we
now
know
that
our
wispy
upper
atmosphere
once
believed
calm
and
uneventful
seethes
with
activity
swelling
by
day
and
contracting
by
night
affected
by
changes
in
solar
activity
the
upper
atmosphere
contributes
to
weather
and
climate
on
earth
besides
affecting
earths
weather
solar
activity
gives
rise
to
a
dramatic
visual
phenomenon
in
our
atmosphere
when
charged
particles
from
the
solar
wind
become
trapped
in
earths
magnetic
field
they
collide
with
air

above
our

magnetic

these
air

then
begin
to

are
known
as
the

continuous

the

the

single
natural

the
first
human

by

six

landed
on
and
explored
the
lunar
surface
between
and
carrying
back
a
collection
of
rocks
and
soil
weighing
a
total
of
kilograms
pounds
and
consisting
of
more
than
separate
samples
from
this
material
and
other
studies
scientists
have
constructed
a
history
of
the
moon
that
includes
its
infancy
rocks
collected
from
the
lunar
highlands
date
to
about
billion
years
old
the
first
few
million
years
of
the
moons
existence
were
so
violent
that
few
traces
of
this
period
remain
as
a
molten
outer
layer
gradually
cooled
and
solidified
into
different
kinds
of
rock
the
moon
was
bombarded
by
huge
asteroids
and
smaller
objects
some
of
the
asteroids
were
as
large
as
rhode
island
or
delaware
and
their
collisions
with
the
moon
created
basins
hundreds
of
kilometers
across
this
catastrophic
bombardment
tapered
off
approximately
four
billion
years
ago
leaving
the
lunar
highlands
covered
with
huge
overlapping
craters
and
a
deep
layer
of
shattered
and
broken
rock
heat
produced
by
the
decay
of
radioactive
elements
began
to
melt
the
interior
of
the
moon
at
depths
of
about
kilometers
miles
below
the
surface
then
for
the
next
million
years
from
about
to
billion
years
ago
lava
rose
from
inside
the
moon
the
lava
gradually
spread
out
over
the
surface
flooding
the
large
impact
basins
to
form
the
dark
areas
that
galileo
galilei
an
astronomer
of
the
italian
renaissance
called
maria
meaning
seas
as
far
as
we
can
tell
there
has
been
no
significant
volcanic
activity
on
the
moon
for
more
than
three
billion
years
since
then
the
lunar
surface
has
been
altered
only
by
micrometeorites
by
the
atomic
particles
from
the
sun
and
stars
by
the
rare
impacts
of
large
meteorites
and
by
spacecraft
and
astronauts
if
our
astronauts
had
landed
on
the
moon
a
billion
years
ago
they
would
have
seen
a
landscape
very
similar
to
the
one
today
thousands
of
years
from
now
the
footsteps
left
by
the
apollo
crews
will
remain
sharp
and
clear
the
origin
of
the
moon
is
still
a
mystery
four
theories
attempt
an
explanation
the
moon
formed
near
earth
as
a
separate
body
it
was
torn
from
earth
it
formed
somewhere
else
and
was
captured
by
our
planets
gravity
or
it
was
the
result
of
a
collision
between
earth
and
an
asteroid
about
the
size
of
mars
the
last
theory
has
some
good
support
but
is
far
from
certain
mars
of
all
the
planets
mars
has
long
been
considered
the
solar
systems
prime
candidate
for
harboring
extraterrestrial
life
astronomers
studying
the
red
planet
through
telescopes
saw
what
appeared
to
be
straight
lines
crisscrossing
its
surface
these
observations
later
determined
to
be
optical
illusions
led
to
the
popular
notion
that
intelligent
beings
had
constructed
a
system
of
irrigation
canals
on
the
planet
in
when
orson
welles
broadcast
a
radio
drama
based
on
the
science
fiction
classic
war
of
the
worlds
by
hg
wells
enough
people
believed
in
the
tale
of
invading
martians
to
cause
a
near
panic
another
reason
for
scientists
to
expect
life
on
mars
had
to
do
with
the
apparent
seasonal
color
changes
on
the
planets
surface
this
phenomenon
led
to
speculation
that
conditions
might
support
a
bloom
of
martian
vegetation
during
the
warmer
months
and
cause
plant
life
to
become
dormant
during
colder
periods
so
far
six
american
missions
to
mars
have
been
carried
out
four
mariner
spacecraft
three
flying
by
the
planet
and
one
placed
into

surveyed
the

extensively
before
the

but
no

and
followed
with
their
flybys
during
the

returned
pictures

and
showed
a
diversity
of
surface
conditions
as
well
as
a
thin
cold
dry
atmosphere
of
carbon

on
may
the
mariner
orbiter
was
launched
on
a
mission
to
make
a
yearlong
study
of
the
martian
surface
the
spacecraft
arrived
five
and
a
half
months
after
liftoff
only
to
find
mars
in
the
midst
of
a
planetwide
dust
storm
that
made
surface
photography
impossible
for
several
weeks
but
after
the
storm
cleared
mariner
began
returning
the
first
of
pictures
these
revealed
previously
unknown
martian
features
including
evidence
that
large
amounts
of
water
once
flowed
across
the
surface
etching
river
valleys
and
flood
plains
in
august
and
september
the
viking
and
spacecraft
each
consisting
of
an
orbiter
and
a
lander
lifted
off
from
kennedy
space
center
the
mission
was
designed
to
answer
several
questions
about
the
red
planet
including
is
there
life
there
nobody
expected
the
spacecraft
to
spot
martian
cities
but
it
was
hoped
that
the
biology
experiments
on
the
viking
landers
would
at
least
find
evidence
of
primitive
life
past
or
present
viking
lander
became
the
first
spacecraft
to
successfully
touch
down
on
another
planet
when
it
landed
on
july
while
the
united
states
was
celebrating
its
bicentennial
photos
sent
back
from
the
chryse
planitia
plains
of
gold
showed
a
bleak
rustyred
landscape
panoramic
images
returned
by
the
lander
revealed
a
rolling
plain
littered
with
rocks
and
marked
by
rippled
sand
dunes
fine
red
dust
from
the
martian
soil
gives
the
sky
a
salmon
hue
when
viking
lander
touched
down
on
utopia
planitia
on
september
it
viewed
a
more
rolling
landscape
than
the
one
seen
by
its
predecessor
one
without
visible
dunes
the
results
sent
back
by
the
laboratory
on
each
viking
lander
were
inconclusive
small
samples
of
the
red
martian
soil
were
tested
in
three
different
experiments
designed
to
detect
biological
processes
while
some
of
the
test
results
seemed
to
indicate
biological
activity
later
analysis
confirmed
that
this
activity
was
inorganic
in
nature
and
related
to
the
planets
soil
chemistry
is
there
life
on
mars
no
one
knows
for
sure
but
the
viking
mission
found
no
evidence
that
organic
molecules
exist
there
the
viking
landers
became
weather
stations
recording
wind
velocity
and
direction
as
well
as
atmospheric
temperature
and
pressure
few
weather
changes
were
observed
the
highest
temperature
recorded
by
either
craft
was
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
at
the
viking
lander
site
in
midsummer
the
lowest
temperature
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
was
recorded
at
the
more
northerly
viking
lander
site
during
winter
nearhurricane
wind
speeds
were
measured
at
the
two
martian
weather
stations
during
global
dust
storms
but
because
the
atmosphere
is
so
thin
wind
force
is
minimal
viking
lander
photographed
light
patches
of
frost
probably
waterice
during
its
second
winter
on
the
planet
the
martian
atmosphere
like
that
of
venus
is
primarily
carbon
dioxide
nitrogen
and
oxygen
are
present
only
in
small
percentages
martian
air
contains
only
about
as
much
water
as
our
air
but
even
this
small
amount
can
condense
out
forming
clouds
that
ride
high
in
the
atmosphere
or
swirl
around
the
slopes
of
towering
volcanoes
local
patches
of
early
morning
fog
can
form
in
valleys
there
is
evidence
that
in
the
past
a
denser
martian
atmosphere
may
have
allowed
water
to
flow
on
the
planet
physical
features
closely
resembling
shorelines
gorges
riverbeds
and
islands
suggest
that
great
rivers
once
marked
the
planet
mars
has
two
moons
phobos
and
deimos
they
are
small
and
irregularly
shaped
and
possess
ancient
cratered
surfaces
it
is
possible
the
moons
were
originally
asteroids
that
ventured
too
close
to
mars
and
were
captured
by
its
gravity
the
viking
orbiters
and
landers
exceeded
by
large
margins
their
design
lifetimes
of
and
days
respectively
the
first
to
fail
was
viking
orbiter
which
stopped
operating
on
july
when
a
leak
depleted
its
attitudecontrol
gas
viking
lander
operated
until
april
when
it
was
shut
down
because
of
battery
degeneration
viking
orbiter
quit
on
august
when
the
last
of
its
attitudecontrol
gas
was
used
up
viking
lander
ceased
functioning
on
november
despite
the
inconclusive
results
of
the
viking
biology
experiments
we
know
more
about
mars
than
any
other
planet
except
earth
nasas
mars
observer
spacecraft
to
be
launched
in
september
will
expand
our
knowledge
of
the
martian
environment
and
lead
to
human
exploration
of
the
red
planet
asteroids
the
solar
system
has
a
large
number
of
rocky
and
metallic
objects
that
are
in
orbit
around
the
sun
but
are
too
small
to
be
considered
fullfledged
planets
these
objects
are
known
as
asteroids
or
minor
planets
most
but
not
all
are
found
in
a
band
or
belt
between
the
orbits
of
mars
and
jupiter
some
have
orbits
that
cross
earths
path
and
there
is
evidence
that
earth
has
been
hit
by
asteroids
in
the
past
one
of
the
least
eroded
best
preserved
examples
is
the
barringer
meteor
crater
near
winslow
arizona
asteroids
are
material
left
over
from
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
one
theory
suggests
that
they
are
the
remains
of
a
planet
that
was
destroyed
in
a
massive
collision
long
ago
more
likely
asteroids
are
material
that
never
coalesced
into
a
planet
in
fact
if
the
estimated
total
mass
of
all
asteroids
was
gathered
into
a
single
object
the
object
would
be
only
about
kilometers
miles
across
less
than
half
the
diameter
of
our
moon
thousands
of
asteroids
have
been
identified
from
earth
it
is
estimated
that
are
bright
enough
to
eventually
be
photographed
through
earthbased
telescopes
much
of
our
understanding
about
asteroids
comes
from
examining
pieces
of
space
debris
that
fall
to
the
surface
of
earth
asteroids
that
are
on
a
collision
course
with
earth
are
called
meteoroids
when
a
meteoroid
strikes
our
atmosphere
at
high
velocity
friction
causes
this
chunk
of
space
matter
to
incinerate
in
a
streak
of
light
known
as
a
meteor
if
the
meteoroid
does
not
burn
up
completely
whats
left
strikes
earths
surface
and
is
called
a
meteorite
one
of
the
best
places
to
look
for
meteorites
is
the
ice
cap
of
antarctica
of
all
the
meteorites
examined
percent
are
composed
of
silicate
stone
and
percent
are
composed
of
iron
and
nickel
the
rest
are
a
mixture
of
the
three
materials
stony
meteorites
are
the
hardest
to
identify
since
they
look
very
much
like
terrestrial
rocks
since
asteroids
are
material
from
the
very
early
solar
system
scientists
are
interested
in
their
composition
spacecraft
that
have
flown
through
the
asteroid
belt
have
found
that
the
belt
is
really
quite
empty
and
that
asteroids
are
separated
by
very
large
distances
current
and
future
missions
will
fly
by
selected
asteroids
for
closer
examination

sulfur

it
is
likely
that
methane

react
to
form
organic
molecules
in
the
regions
between
the

frigid
cloud
tops
and
the
warmer

because
of

however
these

are
probably
shortlived
the

it

the

system
a
new
mission
to
jupiter
the
galileo
project
is
under
way
after
a
six
year
cruise
that
takes
the
galileo
orbiter
once
past
venus
twice
past
earth
and
the
moon
and
once
past
two
asteroids
the
spacecraft
will
drop
an
atmospheric
probe
into
jupiters
cloud
layers
and
relay
data
back
to
earth
the
galileo
orbiter
will
spend
two
years
circling
the
planet
and
flying
close
to
jupiters
large
moons
exploring
in
detail
what
the
two
pioneers
and
two
voyagers
revealed
galilean
satellites
in
galileo
galilei
aimed
his
telescope
at
jupiter
and
spotted
four
points
of
light
orbiting
the
planet
for
the
first
time
humans
had
seen
the
moons
of
another
world
in
honor
of
their
discoverer
these
four
bodies
would
become
known
as
the
galilean
satellites
or
moons
but
galileo
might
have
happily
traded
this
honor
for
one
look
at
the
dazzling
photographs
returned
by
the
voyager
spacecraft
as
they
flew
past
these
planetsized
satellites
one
of
the
most
remarkable
findings
of
the
voyager
mission
was
the
presence
of
active
volcanoes
on
the
galilean
moon
io
volcanic
eruptions
had
never
before
been
observed
on
a
world
other
than
earth
the
voyager
cameras
identified
at
least
nine
active
volcanoes
on
io
with
plumes
of
ejected
material
extending
as
far
as
kilometers
miles
above
the
moons
surface
ios
pizzacolored
terrain
marked
by
orange
and
yellow
hues
is
probably
the
result
of
sulfurrich
materials
brought
to
the
surface
by
volcanic
activity
volcanic
activity
on
this
satellite
is
the
result
of
tidal
flexing
caused
by
the
gravitational
tugofwar
between
io
jupiter
and
the
other
three
galilean
moons
europa
approximately
the
same
size
as
our
moon
is
the
brightest
galilean
satellite
the
moons
surface
displays
a
complex
array
of
streaks
indicating
the
crust
has
been
fractured
caught
in
a
gravitational
tugofwar
like
io
europa
has
been
heated
enough
to
cause
its
interior
ice
to
melt
apparently
producing
a
liquidwater
ocean
this
ocean
is
covered
by
an
ice
crust
that
has
formed
where
water
is
exposed
to
the
cold
of
space
europas
core
is
made
of
rock
that
sank
to
its
center
like
europa
the
other
two
galilean
moons
ganymede
and
callisto
are
worlds
of
ice
and
rock
ganymede
is
the
largest
satellite
in
the
solar
system
larger
than
the
planets
mercury
and
pluto
the
satellite
is
composed
of
about
percent
water
or
ice
and
the
rest
rock
ganymedes
surface
has
areas
of
different
brightness
indicating
that
in
the
past
material
oozed
out
of
the
moons
interior
and
was
deposited
at
various
locations
on
the
surface
callisto
only
slightly
smaller
than
ganymede
has
the
lowest
density
of
any
galilean
satellite
suggesting
that
large
amounts
of
water
are
part
of
its
composition
callisto
is
the
most
heavily
cratered
object
in
the
solar
system
no
activity
during
its
history
has
erased
old
craters
except
more
impacts
detailed
studies
of
all
the
galilean
satellites
will
be
performed
by
the
galileo
orbiter
saturn
no
planet
in
the
solar
system
is
adorned
like
saturn
its
exquisite
ring
system
is
unrivaled
like
jupiter
saturn
is
composed
mostly
of
hydrogen
but
in
contrast
to
the
vivid
colors
and
wild
turbulence
found
in
jovian
clouds
saturns
atmosphere
has
a
more
subtle
butterscotch
hue
and
its
markings
are
muted
by
highaltitude
haze
given
saturns
somewhat
placidlooking
appearance
scientists
were
surprised
at
the
highvelocity
equatorial
jet
stream
that
blows
some
kilometers
miles
per
hour
three
american
spacecraft
have
visited
saturn
pioneer
sped
by
the
planet
and
its
moon
titan
in
september
returning
the
first
closeup
images
voyager
followed
in
november
sending
back
breathtaking
photographs
that
revealed
for
the
first
time
the
complexities
of
saturns
ring
system
and
moons
voyager
flew
by
the
planet
and
its
moons
in
august
the
rings
are
composed
of
countless
lowdensity
particles
orbiting
individually
around
saturns
equator
at
progressive
distances
from
the
cloud
tops
analysis
of
spacecraft
radio
waves
passing
through
the
rings
showed
that
the
particles
vary
widely
in
size
ranging
from
dust
to
housesized
boulders
the
rings
are
bright
because
they
are
mostly
ice
and
frosted
rock
the
rings
might
have
resulted
when
a
moon
or
a
passing
body
ventured
too
close
to
saturn
the
unlucky
object
would
have
been
torn
apart
by
great
tidal
forces
on
its
surface
and
in
its
interior
or
the
object
may
not
have
been
fully
formed
to
begin
with
and
disintegrated
under
the
influence
of
saturns
gravity
a
third
possibility
is
that
the
object
was
shattered
by
collisions
with
larger
objects
orbiting
the
planet
unable
either
to
form
into
a
moon
or
to
drift
away
from
each
other
individual
ring
particles
appear
to
be
held
in
place
by
the
gravitational
pull
of
saturn
and
its
satellites
these
complex
gravitational
interactions
form
the
thousands
of
ringlets
that
make
up
the
major
rings
radio
emissions
quite
similar
to
the
static
heard
on
an
am
car
radio
during
an
electrical
storm
were
detected
by
the
voyager
spacecraft
these
emissions
are
typical
of
lightning
but
are
believed
to
be
coming
from
saturns
ring
system
rather
than
its
atmosphere
where
no
lightning
was
observed
as
they
had
at
jupiter
the
voyagers
saw
a
version
of
earths
auroras
near
saturns
poles
the
voyagers
discovered
new
moons
and
found
several
satellites
that
share
the
same
orbit
we
learned
that
some
moons
shepherd
ring
particles
maintaining
saturns
rings
and
the
gaps
in
the
rings
saturns
moon
was
discovered
in
from
images
taken
by
voyager
in
voyager
determined
that
titan
has
a
nitrogenbased
atmosphere
with
methane
and
argon
one
more
like
earths
in
composition
than
the
carbon
dioxide
atmospheres
of
mars
and
venus
titans
surface
temperature
of
degrees
celsius
degrees
fahrenheit
implies
that
there
might
be
waterice
islands
rising
above
oceans
of
ethanemethane
liquid
or
sludge
unfortunately
voyagers
cameras
could
not
penetrate
the
moons
dense
clouds
continuing
photochemistry
from
solar
radiation
may
be
converting
titans
methane
to
ethane
acetylene
and
in
combination
with
nitrogen
hydrogen
cyanide
the
latter
compound
is
a
building
block
of
amino
acids
these
conditions
may
be
similar
to
the
atmospheric
conditions
of
primeval
earth
between
three
and
four
billion
years
ago
however
titans
atmospheric
temperature
is
believed
to
be
too
low
to
permit
progress
beyond
this
stage
of
organic
chemistry
the
exploration
of
saturn
will
continue
with
the
cassini
mission
the
cassini
spacecraft
will
orbit
the
planet
and
will
also
deploy
a
probe
called
huygens
which
will
be
dropped
into
titans
atmosphere
and
fall
to
the
surface
cassini
will
use
the
probe
as
well
as
radar
to
peer
through
titans
clouds
and
will
spend
years
examining
the
saturnian
system
uranus
in
january
four
and
a
half
years
after
visiting
saturn
voyager
completed
the
first
closeup
survey
of
the
uranian
system
the
brief
flyby
revealed
more
information
about
uranus
and
its
retinue
of
icy
moons
than
had
been
gleaned
from
ground
observations
since
the
planets
discovery
over
two
centuries
ago
by
the
english
astronomer
william
herschel
uranus
third
largest
of
the
planets
is
an
oddball
of
the
solar
system
unlike
the
other
planets
with
the
exception
of
pluto
this
giant
lies
tipped
on
its
side
with
its
north
and
south
poles
alternately
facing
the
sun
during
an
swing
around
the
solar
system
during
voyager
flyby
the
south
pole
faced
the
sun
uranus
might
have
been
knocked
over
when
an
earthsized
object
collided
with
it
early
in
the
life
of
the
solar
system
voyager
found
that
uranus
magnetic
field
does
not
follow
the
usual
northsouth
axis
found
on
the
other
planets
instead
the
field
is
tilted
degrees
and
offset
from
the
planets
center
a
phenomenon
that
on
earth
would
be
like
having
one
magnetic
pole
in
new
york
city
and
the
other
in
the
city
of
djakarta
on
the
island
of
java
in
indonesia
uranus
atmosphere
consists
mainly
of
hydrogen
with
some
percent
helium
and
small
amounts
of
ammonia
methane
and
water
vapor
the
planets
blue
color
occurs
because
methane
in
its

uranus
sunlit

in
a
kind
of

to
be
a
combination
of
acetylene

is
a

approximately
kilometers

there
is
thought
to
be
a
scalding
ocean
of

some
kilometers

deep
beneath
this
ocean
is
an
earthsized
core
of

voyager
discovered
new

orbiting

the
five
previously
known
miranda
ariel
umbriel
titania
and
oberon
range
in
size
from
to
kilometers
to
miles
across
representing
a
geological
showcase
these
five
moons
are
halfice
halfrock
spheres
that
are
cold
and
dark
and
show
evidence
of
past
activity
including
faulting
and
ice
flows
the
most
remarkable
of
uranus
moons
is
miranda
its
surface
features
high
cliffs
as
well
as
canyons
craterpocked
plains
and
winding
valleys
the
sharp
variations
in
terrain
suggest
that
after
the
moon
formed
it
was
smashed
apart
by
a
collision
with
another
body
an
event
not
unusual
in
our
solar
system
which
contains
many
objects
that
have
impact
craters
or
are
fragments
from
large
impacts
what
is
extraordinary
is
that
miranda
apparently
reformed
with
some
of
the
material
that
had
been
in
its
interior
exposed
on
its
surface
uranus
was
thought
to
have
nine
dark
rings
voyager
imaged
in
contrast
to
saturns
rings
which
are
composed
of
bright
particles
uranus
rings
are
primarily
made
up
of
dark
bouldersized
chunks
neptune
voyager
completed
its
tour
of
the
solar
system
with
an
investigation
of
neptune
and
the
planets
moons
on
august
the
spacecraft
swept
to
within
kilometers
miles
of
neptune
and
then
flew
on
to
the
moon
triton
during
the
neptune
encounter
it
became
clear
that
the
planets
atmosphere
was
more
active
than
uranus
voyager
observed
the
great
dark
spot
a
circular
storm
the
size
of
earth
in
neptunes
atmosphere
resembling
jupiters
great
red
spot
the
storm
spins
counterclockwise
and
moves
westward
at
almost
kilometers
miles
per
hour
voyager
also
noted
a
smaller
dark
spot
and
a
fastmoving
cloud
dubbed
the
scooter
as
well
as
highaltitude
clouds
over
the
main
hydrogen
and
helium
cloud
deck
the
highest
wind
speeds
of
any
planet
were
observed
up
to
kilometers
miles
per

like
the
other
giant
planets
neptune
has
a
gaseous
hydrogen
and
helium
upper
layer
over
a
liquid
interior
the
planets
core
contains
a
higher
percentage
of
rock
and
metal
than
those
of
the
other
gas
giants
neptunes
distinctive
blue
appearance
like
uranus
blue
color
is
due
to
atmospheric
methane
neptunes
magnetic
field
is
tilted
relative
to
the
planets
spin
axis
and
is
not
centered
at
the
core
this
phenomenon
is
similar
to
uranus
magnetic
field
and
suggests
that
the
fields
of
the
two
giants
are
being
generated
in
an
area
above
the
cores
where
the
pressure
is
so
great
that
liquid
hydrogen
assumes
the
electrical
properties
of
a
metal
earths
magnetic
field
on
the
other
hand
is
produced
by
its
spinning
metallic
core
and
is
only
slightly
tilted
and
offset
relative
to
its
center
voyager
also
shed
light
on
the
mystery
of
neptunes
rings
observations
from
earth
indicated
that
there
were
arcs
of
material
in
orbit
around
the
giant
planet
it
was
not
clear
how
neptune
could
have
arcs
and
how
these
could
be
kept
from
spreading
out
into
even
unclumped
rings
voyager
detected
these
arcs
but
they
were
in
fact
part
of
thin
complete
rings
a
number
of
small
moons
could
explain
the
arcs
but
such
bodies
were
not
spotted
astronomers
had
identified
the
neptunian
moons
triton
in
and
nereid
in
voyager
found
six
more
one
of
the
new
moons
proteus
is
actually
larger
than
nereid
but
since
proteus
orbits
close
to
neptune
it
was
lost
in
the
planets
glare
for
observers
on
earth
triton
circles
neptune
in
a
retrograde
orbit
in
under
six
days
tidal
forces
on
triton
are
causing
it
to
spiral
slowly
towards
the
planet
in
to
million
years
a
short
time
in
astronomical
terms
the
moon
will
be
so
close
that
neptunian
gravity
will
tear
it
apart
forming
a
spectacular
ring
to
accompany
the
planets
modest
current
rings
tritons
landscape
is
as
strange
and
unexpected
as
those
of
io
and
miranda
the
moon
has
more
rock
than
its
counterparts
at
saturn
and
uranus
tritons
mantle
is
probably
composed
of
waterice
but
the
moons
crust
is
a
thin
veneer
of
nitrogen
and
methane
the
moon
shows
two
dramatically
different
types
of
terrain
the
socalled
cantaloupe
terrain
and
a
receding
ice
cap
dark
streaks
appear
on
the
ice
cap
these
streaks
are
the
fallout
from
geyserlike
volcanic
vents
that
shoot
nitrogen
gas
and
dark
finegrained
particles
to
heights
of
to
kilometers
to
miles
tritons
thin
atmosphere
only
as
thick
as
earths
has
winds
that
carry
the
dark
particles
and
deposit
them
as
streaks
on
the
ice
cap
the
coldest

triton
might
be
more
like
pluto
than
any
other
object
spacecraft
have
so
far
visited
pluto
pluto
is
the
most
distant
of
the
planets
yet
the
eccentricity
of
its
orbit
periodically
carries
it
inside
neptunes
orbit
where
it
has
been
since
and
where
it
will
remain
until
march
plutos
orbit
is
also
highly
inclined
tilted
degrees
to
the
orbital
plane
of
the
other
planets
discovered
in
pluto
appears
to
be
little
more
than
a
celestial
snowball
the
planets
diameter
is
calculated
to
be
approximately
kilometers
miles
only
twothirds
the
size
of
our
moon
groundbased
observations
indicate
that
plutos
surface
is
covered
with
methane
ice
and
that
there
is
a
thin
atmosphere
that
may
freeze
and
fall
to
the
surface
as
the
planet
moves
away
from
the
sun
observations
also
show
that
plutos
spin
axis
is
tipped
by
degrees
the
planet
has
one
known
satellite
charon
discovered
in
charons
surface
composition
is
different
from
plutos
the
moon
appears
to
be
covered
with
waterice
rather
than
methane
ice
its
orbit
is
gravitationally
locked
with
pluto
so
both
bodies
always
keep
the
same
hemisphere
facing
each
other
plutos
and
charons
rotational
period
and
charons
period
of
revolution
are
all
earth
days
although
no
spacecraft
have
ever
visited
pluto
nasa
is
currently
exploring
the
possibility
of
such
a
mission
comets
the
outermost
members
of
the
solar
system
occasionally
pay
a
visit
to
the
inner
planets
as
asteroids
are
the
rocky
and
metallic
remnants
of
the
formation
of
the
solar
system
comets
are
the
icy
debris
from
that
dim
beginning
and
can
survive
only
far
from
the
sun
most
comet
nuclei
reside
in
the
oort
cloud
a
loose
swarm
of
objects
in
a
halo
beyond
the
planets
and
reaching
perhaps
halfway
to
the
nearest
star
comet
nuclei
orbit
in
this
frozen
abyss
until
they
are
gravitationally
perturbed
into
new
orbits
that
carry
them
close
to
the
sun
as
a
nucleus
falls
inside
the
orbits
of
the
outer
planets
the
volatile
elements
of
which
it
is
made
gradually
warm
by
the
time
the
nucleus
enters
the
region
of
the
inner
planets
these
volatile
elements
are
boiling
the
nucleus
itself
is
irregular
and
only
a
few
miles
across
and
is
made
principally
of
waterice
with
methane
and
ammonia
materials
very
similar
to
those
composing
the
moons
of
the
giant
planets
as
these
materials
boil
off
of
the
nucleus
they
form
a
coma
or
cloudlike
head
that
can
measure
tens
of
thousands
of
kilometers
across
the
coma
grows
as
the
comet
gets
closer
to
the
sun
the
stream
of
charged
particles
coming
from
the
sun
pushes
on
this
cloud
blowing
it
back
like
a
flag
in
the
wind
and
giving
rise
to
the
comets
tails
gases
and
ions
are
blown
directly
back
from
the
nucleus
but
dust
particles
are
pushed
more
slowly
as
the
nucleus
continues
in
its
orbit
the
dust
particles
are
left
behind
in
a
curved
arc
both
the
gas
and
dust
tails
point
away
from
the
sun
in
effect
the
comet
chases
its
tails
as
it
recedes
from
the

the
tails
can
reach
million
kilometers
million
miles
in
length
but
the
total
amount
of
material
contained
in
this
dramatic
display
would
fit
in
an
ordinary
suitcase
comets
from
the
latin
cometa
meaning
longhaired
are
essentially
dramatic
light
shows
some
comets
pass
through
the
solar
system
only
once
but
others
have
their
orbits
gravitationally
modified
by
a
close
encounter
with
one
of
the
giant
outer
planets
these
latter
visitors
can
enter
closed
elliptical
orbits
and
repeatedly
return
to
the
inner
solar
system
halleys
comet
is
the
most
famous
example
of
a
relatively
short
period
comet
returning
on
an
average
of
once
every
years
and
orbiting
from
beyond
neptune
to
within
venus
orbit
confirmed
sightings
of
the
comet
go
back
to
bc
this
regular
visitor
to
our
solar
system
is
named
for
sir
edmond
halley
because
he
plotted
the
comets
orbit
and
predicted
its
return
based
on
earlier
sightings
and
newtonian
laws
of
motion
his
name
became
part
of
astronomical
lore
when
in
the
comet
returned
on
schedule
unfortunately
sir
edmond
did
not
live
to
see
it
a
comet
can
be
very
prominent
in
the
sky
if
it
passes
comparatively
close
to
earth
unfortunately
on
its
most
recent
appearance
halleys
comet
passed
no
closer
than
million
kilometers
million
miles
from
our
world
the
comet
was
visible
to
the
naked
eye
especially
for
viewers
in
the
southern
hemisphere
but
it
was
not
spectacular
comets
have
been
so
bright
on
rare
occasions
that
they
were
visible
during
daytime
historically
comet
sightings
have
been
interpreted
as
bad
omens
and
have
been
artistically
rendered
as
daggers
in
the
sky
the
comet
rendezvousasteroid
flyby
craf
spacecraft
will
become
the
first
traveler
to
fly
close
to
a
comet
nucleus
and
remain
in
proximity
to
it
as
they
both
approach
the
sun
craf
will
observe
the
nucleus
as
it
becomes
active
in
the
growing
sunlight
and
begins
to
have
its
lighter
elements
boil
off
and
form
a
coma
and

several
spacecraft
have
flown
by
comets
at
high
speed
the
first
was
nasas
international
cometary
explorer
in
an
armada
of
five
spacecraft
two
japanese
two
soviet
and
the
giotto
spacecraft
from
the
european
space
agency
flew
by
halleys
comet
in
conclusion
despite
their
efforts
to
peer
across
the
vast
distances
of
space
through
an
obscuring
atmosphere
scientists
of
the
past
had
only
one
body
they
could
study
closely
earth
but
since
spaceflight
through
the
solar
system
has
lifted
the
veil
on
our
neighbors
in
space
we
have
learned
more
about
our
solar
system
and
its
members
than
anyone
had
in
the
previous
thousands
of
years
our
automated
spacecraft
have
traveled
to
the
moon
and
to
all
the
planets
beyond
our
world
except
pluto
they
have
observed
moons
as
large
as
small
planets
flown
by
comets
and
sampled
the
solar
environment
astronomy
books
now
include
detailed
pictures
of
bodies
that
were
only
smudges
in
the
largest
telescopes
for
generations
we
are
lucky
to
be
alive
now
to
see
these
strange
and
beautiful
places
and
objects
the
knowledge
gained
from
our
journeys
through
the
solar
system
has
redefined
traditional
earth
sciences
like
geology
and
meteorology
and
spawned
an
entirely
new
discipline
called
comparative
planetology
by
studying
the
geology
of
planets
moons
asteroids
and
comets
and
comparing
differences
and
similarities
we
are
learning
more
about
the
origin
and
history
of
these
bodies
and
the
solar
system
as
a
whole
we
are
also
gaining
insight
into
earths
complex
weather
systems
by
seeing
how
weather
is
shaped
on
other
worlds
and
by
investigating
the
suns
activity
and
its
influence
throughout
the
solar
system
we
can
better
understand
climatic
conditions
and
processes
on
earth
we
will
continue
to
learn
and
benefit
as
our
automated
spacecraft
explore
our
neighborhood
in
space
one
current
mission
is
mapping
venus
others
are
flying
between
worlds
and
will
reach
the
sun
and
jupiter
after
complex
trajectory
adjustments
future
missions
are
planned
for
mars
saturn
a
comet
and
the
asteroid
belt
we
can
also
look
forward
to
the
time
when
humans
will
once
again
set
foot
on
an
alien
world
although
astronauts
have
not
been
back
to
the
moon
since
december
plans
are
being
formulated
for
our
return
to
the
lunar
landscape
and
for
the
human
exploration
of
mars
and
even
the
establishment
of
martian
outposts
one
day
taking
a
holiday
may
mean
spending
a
week
at
a
lunar
base
or
a
martian
colony
