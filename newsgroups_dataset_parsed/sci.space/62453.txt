WOULD
BE
WONDERFULL

CREDIBILITY

MODERN

ASTRONOMY
WHAT
THESE
PROPOSED

BILLBOARDS
WOULD
UPSET
IS
ALREADY
A
DYING
FIELD
THE
AHH
PERHAPS
THATS
WHY
WEVE
ASTRONOMERS
HAVE
JUST
BUILT
GROUNDBASED
SCOPES
AND
ARE
STUDYING
DESIGNS
FOR
LARGER
ONES
SERIOUSLY
THOUGH
YOURE
NEVER
GOING
TO
GET
A
SCOPE
INTO
ORBIT
AS
CHEAPLY
AS
YOU
CAN
BUILD
ONE
ON
THE
GROUND
AND
WITH
ADAPTIVE
OPTICS
AND
A
GOOD
SITE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
QUALITY
IS
NARROWED
QUITE
A
BIT
ANYWAY
ALSO
SCOPES
IN
LOW
ORBIT
LIKE
HUBBLE
CAN
ONLY
OBSERVE
THINGS
CONTINUOUSLY
FOR
MINUTES
AT
A
TIME
WHICH
CAN
BE
A
SERIOUS
LIMITATION
OPACITY
AND
DISTORTIONS
CAUSED
BY
THE
ATMOSPHERE
ITSELF
HAVE
DRIVEN
MOST
OF
THE
FIELD
TO
USE
RADIO
FAR
INFRARED
OR
SPACEBASED
TELESCOPES
IN
ANY
CASE
A
BRIGHT
POINT
OF
LIGHT
PASSING
THROUGH
THE
FIELD
DOESNT
RUIN
OBSERVATIONS
IF
THAT
WERE
THE
CASE
THE
I
SURE
AS
HELL
DOES
IF
THE
POINT
OF
LIGHT
IS
HALF
A
DEGREE
IN
EXTENT
AND
AS
BRIGHT
AS
THE
MOON
HAVE
YOU
EVER
NOTICED
HOW
MUCH
BRIGHTER
THE
NIGHT
SKY
IS
ON
A
MOONLIT
NIGHT
THOUSANDS
OF
EXISTING
SATELLITES
WOULD
HAVE
ALREADY
DONE
SO
SATELLIETS
MIGHT
NOT
SEEM
SO
BRIGHT
TO
THE
EYES
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
ASTRONOMY
IS
CONCERNED
THEY
ARE
EXTREMELY
BRIGHT
EXISTING
SATELLITES
ARE
POINTS
OF
LIGHT
BUT
AN
ADVERTISING
SIGN
THAT
APPEARED
AS
A
POINT
WOULD
BE
USELESS
SO
I
RATHER
THINK
THESE
WILL
APPEAR
LARGER
THAN
A
TYPICAL
SATELLITE
ALSO
SATELLITE

ARE
