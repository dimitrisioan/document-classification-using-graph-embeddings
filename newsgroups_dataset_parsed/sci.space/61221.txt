i
like
option
c
of
the
new
space
station
design
it
needs
some
work
but
it
is
simple
and
elegant
its
about
time
someone
got
into
simple
construction
versus
overly
complex
basically
just
strap
some
rockets
and
a
nose
cone
on
the
habitat
and
go
for
it
might
be
an
idea
for
a
moonmars
base
to
where
is
captain
eugeniasp
when
you
need
it
reference
to
russian
heavy
lifter
i
think
michael
adams
im
not
high
just
jacked
this
is
a
report
i
got
the
subject
messed
up
