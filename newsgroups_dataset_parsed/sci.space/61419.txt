ALSOIF
THEY
DID
COME
FROM
THE
OORT
CLOUD
WE
WOULD
EXPECT
TO
SEE
THE
SAME
FROM
OTHER
STARS
OORT
CLOUDS
THATS
A
VERY
GOOD
POINT
PERHAPS
NONE
OF
THE
NEARBY
STARS
HAVE
OORT
CLOUDS
ALPHACENTAURI
IS
A
MULTIPLESTAR
SYSTEM
YOU
WOULDNT
EXPECT
AN
OORT
CLOUD
IN
IT
SURE
ABOUT
THAT
MAYBE
PROXIMA
MIGHT
CAUSE
PROBLEMS

AT

DISTANCES

TOGETHER
LOOK

A

SOURCE
BESIDES
EVEN
THE

SYSTEMS
OORT
CLOUD
IS
UNSTABLE
OVER
GEOLOGIC
TIME
RIGHT

REPLENTISHED
FROM
SOMEWHERE
ELSE

THE

MAYBE
IM
MISREMEMBERING
SOMETHING

THE

THAT
IS
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
A
PLANETARY
SYSTEM
UNTIL
WERE
ABLE
TO
PERFORM
A
BROADBAND
SURVEY
OF
NEARBY
STARS
TO
DETECT
PLANETS
WE
WONT
KNOW
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
WHETHER
OR
NOT
A

STAR
HAS
PLANETS
AND
WERE
LIKELY
TO
FIND
OUT
ABOUT
THE
CLOSE

HECK
IF

CAN
HAVE

ANYTHING
CAN
HAVE

WAS

SEEMS

EVERY

WE
