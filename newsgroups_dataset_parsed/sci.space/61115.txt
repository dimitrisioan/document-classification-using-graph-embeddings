re
vandalizing
the
sky
i
posted
this
over
in
sciastro
but
it
didnt
make
it
here
thought
you
all
would
like
my
wonderful
pithy
commentary
what
you
guys
have
never
seen
the
goodyear
blimp
polluting
the
daytime
and
nightime
skies
actually
an
oribital
sign
would
only
be
visible
near
sunset
and
sunrise
i
believe
so
pollution
at
night
would
be
minimal
if
it
pays
for
space
travel
go
for
it
those
who
dont
like
spatial
billboards
can
then
head
for
the
pristine
environment
of
jupiters
moons
