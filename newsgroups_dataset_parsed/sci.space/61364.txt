I
SAY
WHAT
IM
OBJECTING
TO
HERE
IS
A
FLOATING
BILLBOARD
THAT
PRESUMABLY
WOULD
MOVE
AROUND
IN
THE
SKY
I
FOR
ONE
AM
AGAINST
LEGISLATING
AT
ALL
I
JUST
WISH
THAT
PEOPLE
HAD
A
BIT
OF
COMMON
COURTESY
AND
WOULD
CONSIDER
HOW
THEIR
GREED
FOR
MONEY
IMPACTS
THE
MORE
ETHEREAL
AND
AESTHETIC
VALUES
THAT
MAKE
US
HUMAN
THIS
INCLUDES
THE
NEED
FOR
WILD
AND
UNSPOILED
THINGS
INCLUDING
THE
NIGHT

WHERE
I
CAN
OBJECT

ANYTHING
I

TO
KNOW
WE
BOTH
CAN
BE
HAPPY
