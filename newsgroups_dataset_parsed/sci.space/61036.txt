was
done
the
hard
way
in
a
big
hurry
from
a
very
limited
technology
base
and
on
government
contracts
just
doing
it
privately
rather
than
as
a
government
project
cuts
costs
by
a
factor
of
several
so
how
much
would
it
cost
as
a
private
venture
assuming
you
could
talk
the
us
government
into
leasing
you
a
couple
of
pads
in

thats
like

why
must
it
be
a
us
government
space
launch
pad
directly
i
mean
i
know
of
a
few
that
could
launch
a
small
package
into
space
not
including
ariadne
and
the
russian
sites
i
know
poker
flats
here
in
alaska
thou
used
to
be
only
sounding
rockets
for
auroral
borealoussp
and
other
northern
atmospheric
items
is
at
last
i
heard
being
upgraded
to
be
able
to
put
sattelites
into
orbit
why
must
people
in
the
us
be
fixed
on
using
nasas
direct
resources
poker
flats
is
runin
part
by
nasa
but
also
by
the
univesity
of
alaska
and
the
geophysical
institute
sounds
like
typical
us
cultural
centralism
and
protectionism
and
people
wonder
why
we
have
the
multitrillion
dollar
