ill
vote
for
anything
where
they
dont
feel
constrained
to
use
stupid

ugly
pc
phrases
to
replace
words
like
manned
if
they
think
they
need
to
do
that
theyre
more
than
likely
engaging
in
politics
and
public
relations
as
usual
rather
than
seriously
wanting
to
actually
get
into
space
so
that
eliminates
option
a
from

what
do
they
call
a

station
in
option
c
im
actually
about
half
serious
about
that
people
should
be
more
concerned
with
grammatical
correctness
and
actually
getting
a
working
station
than
they
are
with
political
correctness
of
terminology
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
