IT
ISNT
FEASIBLE
FOR

TO
TRY
TO
STOCKPILE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
OIL
THEY
WOULD
NEED
TO

THEIR

IF
THEY
DID
NO

THEY

WHAT

THEY

THEY
DONT

ANYWHERE
NEAR

NOT

THEY

ACTUALLY
AUSTRALIA
EXPORTS
A

DOES

I
THINK
OFF

ALWAYS

TO
DISRUPT
THE

LANES
FOR
OIL
WILL
ALSO
HOSE
THEIR
EXPORT
ROUTES
IT
IS
THEIR
IMPORT
ROUTES
THAT
COUNT
THEY
CAN
DO
WITHOUT
EXPORTS
BUT
THEY
COULDNT
LIVE
WITHOUT
IMPORTS
FOR
ANY
LONGER
THAN
SIX
MONTHS
IF
THAT
GIVEN
THEY
IMPORT
EVERYTHING
OIL
IS
JUST
ONE
MORE
CRITICAL
COMMODITY
TOO
TRUE
BUT
ONE
THAT
IS
UNSTABLE
AND
HENCE
A
