BREATHING
FLUIDS
IN
ARTICLE
CALLEC
DRADJA
WRITES
I
AM
A
BIT
NERVOUS
ABOUT
POSTING
THIS
BEACAUSE
IT
IS
BEGINING
TO
STRAY
FRON
THE
TOPIC
OF
SPACE
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
THAT
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
STOP
ALOT
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
WITH
ALL
OF
THIS
TALK
ABOUT
BREATHING
AT
HIGH
PRESSURES
I
BEGAN
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THE
MOVIE
ABYSS
IF
YOU
REMEMBER
IN
THAT
MOVIE
ONE
OF
THE
CHARACTERS
DOVE
TO
GREAT
DEPTHS
BY
WEARING
A
SUIT
THAT
USED
A
FLUID
THAT
CARRIES
OXEGEN
AS
OPPOSED
TO
SOME
SORT
OF
GAS
NOW
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
MICE
CAN
BREATH
THIS
FLUID
BUT
FOR
SOME
REASON
HUMANS
ARE
UNABLE
TO
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
MORE
DETAILS
ABOUT
THIS
GREGSON
VAUX
I
BELIEVE
THE
REASON
IS
THAT
THE
LUNG
DIAPHRAM
GETS
TOO
TIRED
TO
PUMP
THE
LIQUID
IN
AND
OUT
AND
SIMPLY
STOPS
BREATHING
AFTER
MINUTES
SO
IF
YOUR
IN
THE
VEHICLE
READY
TO
GO
THEY
BETTER
NOT
PUT
YOU
ON
HOLD
OR
ELSE
THATS
ABOUT
IT
REMEMBER
A
LIQUID
IS
SEVERAL
MORE
TIMES
AS
DENSE
AS
A
GAS
BY
ITS
VERY
NATURE
I
THINK
DEPENDING
ON
THE
GAS
AND
LIQUID
COMPARISION
OF
COURSE
ACURIST
