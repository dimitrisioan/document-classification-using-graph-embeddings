why
does
the
shuttle
roll
just
after
liftoff
the
following
answer
and
translation
are
provided
by
ken
jenks
kjenksgothamcityjscnasagov
the
ascent
guidance
and
flight
control
training
manual
asc
gc
says
during
the
vertical
rise
phase
the
launch
pad
attitude
is
commanded
until
an
iloaded
vrel
sufficient
to
assure
launch
tower
clearance
is
achieved
then
the
tilt
maneuver
roll
program
orients
the
vehicle
to
a
heads
down
attitude
required
to
generate
a
negative
qalpha
which
in
turn
alleviates
structural
loading
other
advantages
with
this
attitude
are
performance
gain
decreased
abort
maneuver
complexity
improved
sband
look
angles
and
crew
view
of
the
horizon
the
tilt
maneuver
is
also
required
to
start
gaining
downrange
velocity
to
achieve
the
main
engine
cutoff
meco
target
in
second
stage
this
really
is
a
good
answer
but
its
couched
in
nasa
jargon
ill
try
to
interpret
we
wait
until
the
shuttle
clears
the
tower
before
rolling
then
we
roll
the
shuttle
around
so
that
the
angle
of
attack
between
the
wind
caused
by
passage
through
the
atmosphere
the
relative
wind
and
the
chord
of
the
wings
the
imaginary
line
between
the
leading
edge
and
the
trailing
edge
is
a
slightly
negative
angle
a
negative
qalpha
this
causes
a
little
bit
of
downward
force
toward
the
belly
of
the
orbiter
or
the
z
direction
and
this
force
alleviates
structural
loading
we
have
to
be
careful
about
those
wings
theyre
about
the
most
delicate
part
of
the
vehicle
the
new
attitude
after
the
roll
also
allows
us
to
carry
more
mass
to
orbit
or
to
achieve
a
higher
orbit
with
the
same
mass
or
to
change
the
orbit
to
a
higher
or
lower
inclination
than
would
be
the
case
if
we
didnt
roll
performance
gain
the
new
attitude
allows
the
crew
to
fly
a
less
complicated
flight
path
if
they
had
to
execute
one
of
the
more
dangerous
abort
maneuvers
the
return
to
launch
site
decreased
abort
maneuver
complexity
the
new
attitude
improves
the
ability
for
groundbased
radio
antennae
to
have
a
good
lineofsight
signal
with
the
sband
radio
antennae
on
the
orbiter
improved
sband
look
angles
the
new
attitude
allows
the
crew
to
see
the
horizon
which
is
a
helpful
but
not
mandatory
part
of
piloting
any
flying
machine
the
new
attitude
orients
the
shuttle
so
that
the
body
is
more
nearly
parallel
with
the
ground
and
the
nose
to
the
east
usually
this
allows
the
thrust
from
the
engines
to
add
velocity
in
the
correct
direction
to
eventually
achieve
orbit
remember
velocity
is
a
vector
quantity
made
of
both
speed
and
direction
the
shuttle
has
to
have
a
large
horizontal
component
to
its
velocity
and
a
very
small
vertical
component
to
attain
orbit
this
all
begs
the
question
why
isnt
the
launch
pad
oriented
to
give
this
nice
attitude
to
begin
with
why
does
the
shuttle
need
to
roll
to
achieve
that
attitude
the
answer
is
that
the
pads
were
leftovers
from
the
apollo
days
the
shuttle
straddles
two
flame
trenches
one
for
the
solid
rocket
motor
exhaust
one
for
the
space
shuttle
main
engine
exhaust
you
can
see
the
effects
of
this
on
any
daytime
launch
the
srm
exhaust
is
dirty
gray
garbage
and
the
ssme
exhaust
is
fluffy
white
steam
watch
for
the
difference
between
the
top
orbiter
side
and
the
bottom
external
tank
side
of
the
stack
the
access
tower
and
other
support
and
service
structure
are
all
oriented
basically
the
same
way
they
were
for
the
saturn
vs
a
side
note
the
saturn
vs
also
had
a
roll
program
dont
ask
me
why
im
a
shuttle
guy
i
checked
with
a
buddy
in
ascent
dynamics
he
added
that
the
roll
maneuver
is
really
a
maneuver
in
all
three
axes
roll
pitch
and
yaw
the
roll
component
of
that
maneuver
is
performed
for
the
reasons
stated
the
pitch
component
controls
loading
on
the
wings
by
keeping
the
angle
of
attack
qalpha
within
a
tight
tolerance
the
yaw
component
is
used
to
determine
the
orbital
inclination
the
total
maneuver
is
really
expressed
as
a
quaternion
a
gradlevelmath
concept
for
combining
all
three
rotation
matrices
in
one
fourelement
array
