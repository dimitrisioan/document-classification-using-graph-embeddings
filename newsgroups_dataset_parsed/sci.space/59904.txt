ARE

TO

THE

TARGET
IN

THIS
REALLY
IS
A

ANSWER
BUT
ITS
COUCHED
IN
NASA
JARGON
ILL
TRY
TO
INTERPRET
WE
WAIT
UNTIL
THE
SHUTTLE
CLEARS
THE
TOWER
BEFORE
ROLLING
THEN
WE
ROLL
THE
SHUTTLE
AROUND
SO
THAT
THE
ANGLE
OF
ATTACK
BETWEEN
THE
WIND
CAUSED
BY
PASSAGE
THROUGH
THE
ATMOSPHERE
THE
RELATIVE
WIND
AND
THE
CHORD
OF
THE
WINGS
THE
IMAGINARY
LINE
BETWEEN
THE
LEADING
EDGE
AND
THE
TRAILING
EDGE
IS
A
SLIGHTLY
NEGATIVE
ANGLE
A
NEGATIVE
QALPHA
THIS
CAUSES
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
DOWNWARD
FORCE
TOWARD
THE
BELLY
OF
THE
ORBITER
OR
THE
Z
DIRECTION
AND
THIS
FORCE
ALLEVIATES
STRUCTURAL
LOADING
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
THOSE
WINGS
THEYRE
ABOUT
THE
MOST
DELICATE
PART
OF
THE
VEHICLE
THE
NEW
ATTITUDE
AFTER
THE
ROLL
ALSO
ALLOWS
US
TO
CARRY
MORE
MASS
TO
ORBIT
OR
TO
ACHIEVE
A
HIGHER
ORBIT
WITH
THE
SAME
MASS
OR
TO
CHANGE
THE
ORBIT
TO
A
HIGHER
OR
LOWER
INCLINATION
THAN
WOULD
BE
THE
CASE
IF
WE
DIDNT
ROLL
PERFORMANCE
GAIN
THE
NEW
ATTITUDE
ALLOWS
THE
CREW
TO
FLY
A
LESS
COMPLICATED
FLIGHT
PATH
IF
THEY
HAD
TO
EXECUTE
ONE
OF
THE
MORE
DANGEROUS
ABORT
MANEUVERS
THE

DECREASED
ABORT
MANEUVER
COMPLEXITY
THE
NEW
ATTITUDE
IMPROVES
THE

WITH

THE
NEW
ATTITUDE
ALLOWS
THE
CREW
TO
SEE
THE
HORIZON
WHICH
IS
A
HELPFUL
BUT
NOT
MANDATORY
PART
OF
PILOTING
ANY
FLYING
MACHINE
THE
NEW
ATTITUDE
ORIENTS
THE
SHUTTLE
SO
THAT
THE
BODY
IS
MORE
NEARLY
PARALLEL
WITH
THE
GROUND
AND
THE
NOSE
TO
THE
EAST
USUALLY
THIS
ALLOWS
THE
THRUST
FROM
THE
ENGINES
TO
ADD
VELOCITY
IN
THE
CORRECT
DIRECTION
TO
EVENTUALLY
ACHIEVE
ORBIT
REMEMBER
VELOCITY
IS
A
VECTOR
QUANTITY
MADE
OF
BOTH
SPEED
AND
DIRECTION
THE
SHUTTLE
HAS
TO
HAVE
A
LARGE
HORIZONTAL
COMPONENT
TO
ITS
VELOCITY
AND
A
VERY
SMALL
VERTICAL
COMPONENT
TO
ATTAIN
ORBIT
THIS
ALL
BEGS
THE
QUESTION
WHY
ISNT
THE
LAUNCH
PAD
ORIENTED
TO
GIVE
THIS
NICE
ATTITUDE
TO
BEGIN
WITH
WHY
DOES
THE
SHUTTLE
NEED
TO
ROLL
TO
ACHIEVE
THAT
ATTITUDE
THE
ANSWER
IS
THAT
THE
PADS
WERE
LEFTOVERS
FROM
THE
APOLLO
DAYS
THE
SHUTTLE
STRADDLES
TWO
FLAME

YOU

OF

THE

AND
THE
