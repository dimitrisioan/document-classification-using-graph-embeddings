WRITES
PEOPLE
WHO
CRITICIZE
BIG
GOVERNMENT
AND
ITS
PROJECTS
RARELY
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
CONSISTENT
VIEW
OF
THE
ROLE
OF
GOVERNMENT
IN
SCIENCE
AND
TECHNOLOGY
BASICALLY
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
HAS
GOTTEN
INTO
THE
ROLE
OF
SUPPORTING
RESEARCH
WHICH
PRIVATE
INDUSTRY
FINDS
TOO
EXPENSIVE
OR
TOO
LONGTERM
HISTORICALLY
THIS
ROLE
FOR
THE
US
GOVT
WAS
FORCED
UPON
IT
BECAUSE
OF
SOCIALISM
IN
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
ORDER
FOR
US
INDUSTRIES
TO
COMPETE
WITH
GOVERNMENTSUBSIDIZED
FOREIGN
COMPETITORS
THE
US
GOVT
HAS
TAKEN
ON
THE
ROLE
OF
SUBISIZING
BIGTICKET
OR
LONGLEAD
RD
THIS
DEFINITELY
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
ENTRY
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
INTO
THE
SUPPORT
OF
SCIENCE
SOME
OF
IT
IS
RELEVANT
IN
TECHNOLOGY
THERE
WAS
LITTLE
INVOLVEMENT
OF
FEDERAL
FUNDS
OR
EXCEPT
THROUGH
SUPPORT
OF
STATE
UNIVERSITIES
OF
STATE
FUNDS
FOR
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
BEFORE
WWII
THE
US
RESEARCH
POSITION
HAD
BEEN
GROWING
STEADILY
AND
THE
FUNDING
WAS
MAINLY
FROM
UNIVERSITY
AND
PRIVATE
FOUNDATION
FUNDS
THERE
WERE
NOT
THAT
MANY
RESEARCH
UNIVERSITIES
BUT
THEY
ALL
PROVIDED
THEIR
RESEARCHERS
WITH
LOW
TEACHING
LOADS
LABORATORIES
ASSISTANTS
AND
EQUIPMENT
AND
FUNDS
FOR
TRAVEL
TO
SCIENTIFIC
MEETINGS
NOT
THAT
MUCH
BUT
IT
WAS
PROVIDED
AND
A
UNIVERSITY
WISHING
TO
GET
A
SCHOLAR
HAD
TO
CONSIDER
RESEARCH
FUNDING
AS
WELL
AS
SALARY
DURING
WWII
THE
MILITARY
AND
THE
DEFENSE
DEPARTMENTS
FOUND
THAT
PURE
SCIENTISTS
COULD
DO
QUITE
WELL
WITH
THEIR
PROBLEMS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
NOT
EXACTLY
IN
THE
AREAS
OF
THE
SCIENTISTS
EXPERTISE
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
RESEARCH
MIND
APPROACH
WHICH
IS
NOT
TO
TRY
TO
FIND
A
SOLUTION
BUT
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
PROBLEM
AND
SEE
IF
A
SOLUTION
EMERGES
THIS
WORKS
IN
STAGES
AND
AS
RESEARCH
SCIENTISTS
WERE
USED
TO
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
THEIR
PROBLEMS
THE
JOB
GOT
DONE
THE
MILITARY
REALIZED
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
MAINTAINING
SCIENTISTS
FOR
THE
FUTURE
AND
STARTED
FUNDING
PURE
RESEARCH
AFTER
WWII
BUT
CONGRESS
WAS
UNWILLING
TO
HAVE
MILITARY
FUNDS
DIVERTED
INTO
THIS
INVESTMENT
INTO
THE
FUTURE
SUPPLY
OF
SCIENTISTS
AND
SET
UP
OTHER
ORGANIZATIONS
SUCH
AS
NSF
TO
DO
THE
JOB
IT
ALSO
SET
UP
AN
ELABORATE
PROCEDURE
TO
SUPPOSEDLY
KEEP
POLITICS
OUT
ALSO
THE
GOVERNMENT
DID
A
JOB
ON
PRIVATE
FOUNDATIONS
MAKING
IT
MORE
DIFFICULT
FOR
THEM
TO
ACT
TO
SUPPORT
RESEARCH
THE
WORST
PART
OF
THE
FEDERAL
INVOLVEMENT
IS
THAT
IN
THOSE
AREAS
IN
WHICH
THE
GOVERNMENT
SUPPORTS
RESEARCH
THE
UNIVERSITY
WILL
NOT
PROVIDE
FUNDING
AND
IN
FACT
EXPECTS
ITS
SCHOLARS
TO
BRING
IN
NET
GOVERNMENT
MONEY
SUPPOSE
AS
HAS
BEEN
THE
CASE
I
HAVE
A
PROJECT
WHICH
COULD
USE
THE
ASSISTANCE
OF
A
GRADUATE
STUDENT
FOR
A
FEW
MONTHS
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
HAPPENS
IF
I
ASK
FOR
ONE
THE
ANSWER
I
WILL
GET
IS
GET
THE
MONEY
FROM
NSF
NOW
THE
MONEY
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
LEVEL
IS
A
FEW
THOUSAND
BUT
AT
THE
NSF
LEVEL
IT
COMES
TO
ABOUT
THOUSAND
AND
IS
LIKELY
TO
KEEP
A
FACULTY
MEMBER
FROM
GETTING
SUPPORTED
SO
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
IN
EFFECT
DECIDING
WHICH
PROJECTS
GET
SUPPORTED
AND
HOW
MUCH
ALSO
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECIDED
THAT
THE
WEALTH
SHOULD
BE
SPREAD
SO
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
A
MODERATE
NUMBER
OF
UNIVERSITIES
WHICH
WERE
PRIMARILY
RESEARCH
INSTITUTIONS
THE
IDEA
THAT
MORE
SCHOOLS
SHOULD
GET
INTO
THE
ACT
CAME
INTO
BEING
AND
INSTEAD
OF
EVALUATING
SCHOLARS
THEY
HAD
TO
GO
TO
EVALUATING
RESEACH
PROPOSALS
AS
A
RESEARCHER
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
ANY
RESEARCH
PROPOSAL
HAS
TO
BE
MAINLY
WISHFUL
THINKING
OR
AS
NOW
HAPPENS
THE
INVESTIGATOR
CONCEALS
ALREADY
DONE
WORK
TO
RELEASE
IT
AS
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
RESEARCH
WHAT
I
AM
PROPOSING
TODAY
I
MAY
SOLVE
BEFORE
THE
FUNDING
IS
GRANTED
I
MAY
FIND
IMPOSSIBLE
OR
I
MAY
FIND
THAT
IT
IS
TOO
DIFFICULT
IN
ADDITION
TOMORROW
I
MAY
GET
UNEXPECTED
RESEARCH
RESULTS
POSSIBLY
I
MAY
BET
A
BRIGHT
IDEA
WHICH
SOLVES
YESTERDAYS
TOO
DIFFICULT
PROBLEM
OR
A
WHOLE
NEW
APPROACH
TO
SOMETHING
I
HAD
NOT
CONSIDERED
CAN
DEVELOP
THIS
IS
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
BEAST
AND
EXCEPT
FOR
REALLY
VAGUE
STATEMENTS
IF
SOMETHING
CAN
BE
PREDICTED
IT
IS
NOT
MAJOR
RESEARCH
BUT
DEVELOPMENT
OR
ROUTINE
ACTIVITY
NOT
REQUIRING
MORE
THAN
MINIMAL
ATTENTION
OF
A
GOOD
RESEARCHER
I
BELIEVE
THAT
AT
THIS
TIME
LESS
QUALITY
RESEARCH
IS
BEING
DONE
THAN
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAD
NEVER
GOTTEN
INTO
IT
AND
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
TRYING
TO
DIVERT
RESEARCHERS
FROM
THINKERS
TO
PLODDERS
