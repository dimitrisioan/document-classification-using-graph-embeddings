WRITES
OKAY
THE
EARTH
HAS
A
MAGNETIC
FIELD
UNLESS
SOMEONE
MISSED
SOMETHING
OKAY
IF
YOU
PUT
A
OBJECT
IN
THE
EARTH
MAGNETIC
FIELD
IT
PRODUCES
ELECTRICTY
NO
IF
YOU
PUT
A
CONDUCTOR
IN
A
CHANGING
MAGNETIC
FIELD
IT
PRODUCES
A
VOLTAGE
THE
TWO
WAYS
YOU
CAN
DO
THAT
WITH
A
PERMANENT
MAGNET
IS
TO
MOVE
THE
MAGNET
OR
MOVE
THE
CONDUCTOR
THE
SLOW
SHIFTING
OF
THE
EARTHS
MAGNETIC
FIELD
ISNT
REALLY
SIGNIFICANT
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
YOU
CONSIDER
HOW
WEAK
THE
EARTHS
MAGNETIC
FIELD
IS
TO
BEGIN
WITH
NOW
THE
QUESTION
CAN
YOU
USE
ELECTRICITY
TO
POWER
A
SPACELOW
EARTH
ORBIT
VEHICLE
AND
I
FYOU
CAN
CAN
YOU
USE
THE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
OF
THE
EARTH
TO
POWER
IT
WELL
IT
WOULD
REQUIRE
GENERATING
AN
INCREDIBLY
LARGE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
TO
REPEL
THE
EARTHS
MAGNETIC
FIELD
AS
A
MAGNET
CAN
REPEL
ANOTHER
MAGNET
OF
COURSE
THIS
FORCE
ONLY
WORKS
IN
ONE
DIRECTION
AND
THE
MAGNETIC
FIELD
GENERATED
HAS
TO
BE
UNIMAGINABLY
POWERFUL
MAGNETIC
REPULSION
DROPS
OFF
AS
AND
THE
EARTHS
MAGNETIC
FIELD
ON
THE
SURFACE
IS
ALREADY
VERY
WEAK
IT
WOULD
REQUIRE
SOME
SORT
OF
UNKNOWN
SUPERCONDUCTOR
AND
SPECIAL
NONMAGNETIC
CONSTRUCTION
AND
SERIOUSLY
HARDENNED
ELECTRONICS
OPTICAL
COMPUTERS
PERHAPS
AND
THE
PHYSIOLOGICAL
DANGER
WOULD
BE
SIGNIFICANT
DUE
TO
THE
IRON
CONTENT
IN
OUR
BLOOD
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
FORGET
IT
CAN
THE
IDEA
OF
A
DRAGLESS
SATELLITE
BE
USED
IN
PART
TO
CREATE
THE
ELECTRICAL
FIELD
AFTER
ALL
THE
DRAGLESS
SATELLITE
IS
I
MIGHT
BE
WRONG
A
SUSPENDED
BETWEEN
TO
PILONS
THE
THE
PILONS
COMPENSATE
FOR
DRAG
I
THINK
I
KNOW
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
SAY
JUST
NOT
SURE
HOW
TO
SAY
IT
A
DRAGLESS
SATELLITE
SOUNDS
INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH
LIEK
A
GENERATOR
I
MISSED
OUT
ON
THE
DRAGLESS
SATELLITE
THREAD
BUT
IT
SOUNDS
TOTALLY
BOGUS
FROM
THIS
