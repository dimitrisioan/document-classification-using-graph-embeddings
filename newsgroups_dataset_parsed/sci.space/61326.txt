WHAT
I
REALLY
MEANT
THANKS
TO
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
ANSWERED
HERE
AND
IN
EMAIL
TO
MY
QUESTION
ABOUT
WHICH
COUNTRIES
ENGAGE
IN
SPACE
SURVEILLANCE
UNFORTUNATELY
I
APPARENTLY
DIDNT
MAKE
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
MESSAGE
CLEAR
SINCE
MOST
REPLIES
HAVE
ADDRESSED
SATELLITE
RECONNAISSANCE
RATHER
THAN
SPACE
SURVEILLANCE
WHAT
I
MEANT
WAS
NOT
WHICH
COUNTRIES
USE
SATELLITES
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
EARTH
SATELLITE
RECONNAISSANCE
BUT
WAS
WHICH
COUNTRIES
HAVE
PROGRAMS
TO
DETECT
AND
TRACK
IE
DETERMINE
THE
ORBITAL
ELEMENTS
OF
SATELLITES
AS
THEY
PASS
OVERHEAD
SPACE
SURVEILLANCE
THE
US
USES
MISSILEDEFENSE
RADARS
SUPPLEMENTED
BY
A
FASCINATING
QUASIRADAR
OPERATED
BY
THE
NAVY
TO
DO
THIS
FOR
SATELLITES
IN
LEO
AND
ELECTROOPTICAL
SYSTEMS
FOR
OBJECTS
AT
ALTITUDES
ABOVE
KM
OR
SO
THE
FEE
I
UNDERSTAND
DOES
MUCH
THE
SAME
THING
AMATEUR
SATELLITE
OBSERVERS
USE
EYEBALLS
BINOCULARS
STOPWATCHES
AND
PCS
FOR
OBJECTS
OUT
TO
AROUND
KM
ENABLING
THEM
TO
KEEP

OF

AS
WELL
AS
THE

IN
THE
MOLCZAN
DIRECTORY
ON
KILROYJPLNASAGOV
THE
MATERIAL
POSTED
IN
MY
PREVIOUS
MESSAGE
SUGGESTS
THAT
JAPAN
ENGAGES
IN
OPTICAL
AND
RADAR
SPACE
SURVEILLANCE
TO
A
MODEST
DEGREE
AND
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
OTHER
COUNTRIES
DO
ALSO
WHICH
WAS
THE
QUESTION
I
MEANT
TO
ASK
WHO
ARE
THEY
HOW
DO
THEY
DO
IT
AND
WHY
DO
THEY
DO
IT
