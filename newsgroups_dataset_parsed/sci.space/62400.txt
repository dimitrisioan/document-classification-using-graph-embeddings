in
the
new
york
times
on
sunday
may
in
the
week
in
review
section
there
was
a
report
of
a
group
called
space
marketing
in
atlanta
georgia
who
is
planning
to
put
up
a
one
mile
wide
reflective
earth
orbiting
satelite
which
will
appear
as
large
and
as
bright
as
the
moon
and
carry
some
sort
of
advertising
there
was
an
editorial
about
this
in
the
times
the
following
tuesday
i
realy
like
this
idea
it
would
be
wonderfull
to
see
such
a
big
bright
satelite
on
the
night
sky
i
will
even
promise
to
try
to
buy
whatever
product

this
project

space
advertisement
in
low
earth
orbit
is
very
short
term
on
the
order
of
a
few
years
before
the
orbit
decays
higher
orbits
last
longer
advertisers
will
certainly
be
aware
of
the
environmental
aspects
of
their
advertising
freds
argument
is
roughly
akin
to
saying
that
its
bad
to
cut
down
trees
so
we
shouldnt
advertise
in
newspapers
think
that
through
fred
picture
this
our
space
billboard
is
a
large
inflatable
structure
filled
with
biodegradable
foam
instead
of
gas
it
scoops
up
space
debris
as
it
orbits
thus
cleaning
the
space
environment
and
bringing
you
the
pause
that
refreshes
at
the
same
time
because
of
the
large
drag
coefficient
it
will
deorbit
safely
burning
up
within
a
year
embedded
in
the
foam
structure
is
a
small
reentry
vehicle
which
does
not
burn
up
during
entry
it
contains
the
electronics
and
propulsion
system
which
may
be
refurbished
and
reused
as
well
as
space
science
experiments
proposed
and
built
by
high
school
students

science
fairs
advertisers
buy
time
on
the
billboard
whose
surface
is
made
up
of
tiny
mirrors
controlled
by
the
avionics
package
the
avionics
can
reconfigure
the
mirrors
to
reflect
different
messages
at
different
parts
of
the
globe
clever
programming
allows
different
languages
to
every
country
during
orbital
night
the
mirrors
turn
perpendicular
to
the
surface
and
small
lights
are
revealed
the
lights
spell
out
