I
LOVE
THE
IDEA
OF
AN
INFLATABLE
LONG
SIGN
IT
WILL
BE
A
REALLY
NEAT
THING
TO
SEE
IT
EXPLODE
WHEN
A
BOLT
OR
EVEN
BETTER
A
WESTFORD
NEEDLE
COMES
CRASHING
INTO
IT
AT
CLICKS
A
SEC
BOOM
WHOOOOOOOOSHHHHHH
SPUTTER
SPUTTER
OKAY
PRETEND
IT
WOULD
MAKE
A
SOUND
JUST
A
THOUGHT
LETS
PRETEND
IT
IS
INFLATED
AND
PRESSURIZED
WOULDNT
THERE
BE
A
LARGE
STATIC
ELECTRICITY
BUILD
UP
AROUND
THE
PUNCTURE
IF
THE
METALIZATION
IS
BEHIND
A
CLEAR
SANDWICH
IE
INSULATED
THEN
THE
DEFLATING
BALLOON
WOULD
GENERATE
ELECTRICAL
INTERFERENCE
NOISE
BY
THE
WAY
ANY
SERIOUS
HIGH
VELOCITY
IMPACT
WOULD
SIMPLY
CUT
A
BUGS
BUNNY
HOLE
THROUGH
THE
WALL
HIGHLY
UNLIKELY
TO
BOOM
AND
THE
FABRIC
WOULD
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
BE
RIPSTOP
REGARDS
ROBIN
KENNY
A
PRIVATE
AND
PERSONAL
OPINION
NOT
IN
ANY
WAY
ENDORSED
AUTHORISED
OR
KNOWN
BY
MY
EMPLOYERS
WHAT
THE
HECK
WOULD
I
KNOW
ABOUT
SPACE
IM
STUCK
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THIS
HUGE
GRAVITY
WELL
