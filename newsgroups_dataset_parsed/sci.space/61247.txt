i
love
the
idea
of
an
inflatable
long
sign
it
will
be
a
really
neat
thing
to
see
it
explode
when
a
bolt
or
even
better
a
westford
needle
comes
crashing
into
it
at
clicks
a
sec
boom
whooooooooshhhhhh
sputter
sputter
okay
pretend
it
would
make
a
sound
just
a
thought
lets
pretend
it
is
inflated
and
pressurized
wouldnt
there
be
a
large
static
electricity
build
up
around
the
puncture
if
the
metalization
is
behind
a
clear
sandwich
ie
insulated
then
the
deflating
balloon
would
generate
electrical
interference
noise
by
the
way
any
serious
high
velocity
impact
would
simply
cut
a
bugs
bunny
hole
through
the
wall
highly
unlikely
to
boom
and
the
fabric
would
almost
certainly
be
ripstop

private

what
the
heck
would
i
know
about
space

stuck

this
huge
