BTW
UNIVERSITIES

THE
SAME
THING
THEY
HOWEVER
HAVE
A
WRAP
OF
TO
AGAIN
THIS
IS
OVER
AND
ABOVE
ANY
OVERHEAD
CHARGE
WRONG
ALLEN
THE
MAX
OVERHEAD
CHARGE
IS
ALL
OF
THE
CHARGE
THERE
IS
NO
SEPERATELY
BUDGETED
OVERHEAD
IN
ANY
SHAPE
SIZE
FORM
OR
FASHION
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
VIRGINIA
TOLD
ME
THEIR
WRAP
WAS
ABOUT
THE
SUBCONTRACTS
I
HAVE
LET
OUT
AND
WORKED
ON
FOR
OTHER
UNIVERSITIES
ARE
ABOUT
THE
SAME
MY
EMPLOYER
A
NONPROFIT
RESEARCH
INSTITUTE
DOES
THE
SAME
THIS
IS
GENERALLY
REFFERED
TO
AS
THE
FEE
I
DONT
CARE
WHO
TOLD
YOU
THIS
IT
IS
NOT
GENERALLY
TRUE
I
SEE
EVERY
SINGLE
LINE
ITEM
ON
A
CONTRACT
AND
I
HAVE
TO
SIGN
IT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
WRAP
AT
THIS
UNIVERSITY
I
ALSO
ASKED
AROUND
HERE
THER
IS
NO
WRAP
AT
MARQUETTE
UNIVERSITY
OF
WISCONSIN
MADISON
UTAH
STATE
WEBER
STATE
OR
EMBRY
RIDDLE
U
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
IT
DOEES
NOT
HAPPEN
BUT
IN
EVERY
INSTANCE
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
TRACK
DOWN
IT
DOES
NOT
ALSO
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
OUR
UNIVERSITY
WHO
WAS
PROVOST
AT
UNIVERSITY
OF
WEST
VIRGINA
SAID
THAT
IT
DID
NOT
HAPPEN
THERE
EITHER
AND
THAT
THIS
FIGURE
MUST
BE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
OVERHEAD
TO
BE
A
LEGITIMATE
CHARGE
HOW
DO
I
KNOW
I
WRITE
PROPOSALS
AND
HAVE
WON
CONTRACTS
AND
I
KNOW
TO
THE
DIME
WHAT
THE
CHARGES
ARE
AT
UAH
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
OVERHEAD
IS
SOUNDS
LIKE
THEY
ARE
ADDING
IT
TO
THEIR
OVERHEAD
RATE
GO
ASK
YOUR
COSTING
PEOPLE
HOW
MUCH
FEE
THEY
ADD
TO
A
PROJECT
I
DID
THEY
NEVER
HEARD
OF
IT
BUT
SUGGEST
THAT
LIKE
OUR
PRESIDENT
DID
THAT
ANY
PERCENTAGE
NUMBER
LIKE
THIS
IS
INCLUDED
IN
THE
OVERHEAD
IF
YOU
HAVE
SOME
NUMBERS
ALLEN
THEN
SHOW
THEM
ELSE
QUIT
BARKING
I
DID
DENNIS
READ
THE
ARTICLE
TO
REPEAT
AN
INTERNAL
ESTIMATE
DONE
BY
THE
RESTON
COSTING
DEPARTMENT
SAYS
FREEDOM
CAN
BE
BUILT
FOR
ABOUT
A
YEAR
AND
OPERATED
FOR
PER
YEAR
IF
ALL
THE
MONEY
WHERE
SPENT
ON
FREEDOM
SINCE
WE
SPEND
ABOUT
HALF
A
BILLION
MORE
PER
YEAR
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
ROUGHLY
OF
THE
MONEY
IS
WASTED
NOW
IF
YOU
THINK
IM
MAKING
THIS
UP
YOU
CAN
CONFIRM
IT
IN
THE
ANONYMOUS
EDITORIAL
PUBLISHED
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
IN
SPACE
NEWS
NO
ALLEN
YOU
DID
NOT
YOU
MERELY
REPEATED
ALLEGATIONS
MADE
BY
AN
EMPLOYEE
OF
THE
OVERHEAD
CAPITAL
OF
NASA
NOTHING
THAT
RESTON
DOES
COULD
NOT
BE
DONT
BETTER
OR
CHEAPER
AT
THE
OTHER
NASA
CENTERS
WHERE
THE
WORK
IS
GOING
ON
KINDA
FUNNY
ISNT
IT
THAT
SOMEONE
WHO
TALKS
ABOUT
A
PROBLEM
LIKE
THIS
IS
AT
A
PLACE
WHERE
EVERYTHING
IS
OVERHEAD
THIS
DENNIS
IS
WHY
NASA
HAS
SO
MANY
PROBLEMS
YOU
CANT
ACCEPT
THAT
ANYTHING
IS
WRONG
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
BLAME
IT
ON
CONGRESS
OH
SURE
YOULL
SAY
NASA
HAS
PROBLEMS
BUT
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
IT
REMEMBER
THE
WP
OVERRUN
YOU
INSISTED
IT
WAS
ALL
CONGRESSES
FAULT
WHEN
NASA
MANAGEMENT
KNEW
ABOUT
THE
OVERRUN
FOR
ALMOST
A
YEAR
YET
REFUSED
TO
ACT
DO
YOU
STILL
BLAME
CONGRESS
FOR
THE
OVERRUN
WHY
DID
THE
SPACE
NEWS
ARTICE
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
CONGRESSIONALLY
DEMANDED
CHANGE
THAT
CAUSED
THE
PROBLEMS
METHINKS
THAT
YOU
ARE
BEING
SELECTIVE
WITH
THE
FACTS
AGAIN
BY
YOUR
OWN
NUMBERS
ALLEN
AT
A
COST
OF
MILLION
PER
FLIGHT
THE
SERVICE
COST
OF
FLYING
SHUTTLE
TO
SSF
IS
BILLION
FOR
FOUR
FLIGHTS
SO
HOW
DID
YOU
GET
YOUR
ONE
BILLION
NUMBER
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHAT
YOUR
TRYING
TO
SAY
HERE
DENNIS
ALLEN
IF
IT
TAKES
FOUR
FLIGHTS
A
YEAR
TO
RESUPPLY
THE
STATION
AND
YOU
HAVE
A
COST
OF
MILLION
A
FLIGHT
THEN
YOU
PAY
BILLION
A
YEAR
YOU
STATED
THAT
YOUR
FRIEND
AT
RESTON
SAID
THAT
WITH
THE
CURRENT
STATION
THEY
COULD
RESUPPLY
IT
FOR
A
BILLION
A
YEAR
IF
THE
WRAP
WERE
GONE
THIS
MERELY
POINTS
OUT
A
BLATENT
CONTRIDICTION
IN
YOUR
NUMBERS
THAT
UNDERSTANDABLY
YOU
FAIL
TO
SEE
DENNIS
UNIVERSITY
OF
ALABAMA
IN
HUNTSVILLE
SORRY
GANG
BUT
I
HAVE
A
DEADLINE
FOR
A
SATELLITE
SO
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
DO
ALLENS
MATH
FOR
HIM
FOR
A
WHILE
I
WILL
HAVE
LITTLE
CHANCE
TO
DO
SO
