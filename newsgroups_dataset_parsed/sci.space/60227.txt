may
remain
in

jupiter
long
enough
to
allow
galileo
to
make
some
closeup
observations
the
orbital
trajectory
for
comet
shoemakerlevy
is
still
being
determined
a
what
about
positional
uncertainties
in
sl
if
comet
shoemakerlevy
is
in
jovian
orbit
and
if
the
comet
is
still
hanging
around
when
galileo
arrives
then
im
sure
it
will
be
added
to
the
list
of
targets
well
have
by
then
over
two
years
of
earthbased
observations
to
help
narrow
down
the
positions
of
the
pieces
of
the
comet
it
probably
wont
be
too
much
different
than
what
was
done
with
gaspra
but
when
they
were
imaging
toutatis
galileo
did
not
image
toutatis
that
came
from
earthbased
radar
