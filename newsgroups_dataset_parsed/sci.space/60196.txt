THIS
SYSTEM
WOULD
PRODUCE
ENOUGH
ENERGY
TO
DRIVE
THE
ACCELERATOR
PERHAPS
WITH
SOME
LEFT
OVER
A
VERY
HIGH
POWER
OF
MW
CW
OR
QUASI
CW
VERY
SHARP
PROTON
BEAM
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
BUT
THIS
APPEARS
ACHIEVABLE
USING
A
LINEAR
ACCELERATOR
THE
BIGGEST
QUESTION
MARK
WOULD
BE
THE
LEAD
TARGET
CHEMISTRY
AND
THE
ONLINE
PROCESSING
OF
ALL
THE
ELEMENTS
BEING
INCINERATED
PAUL
QUITE
FRANKLY
ILL
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
REALLY
GOING
TO
WORK
ON
THE
TYPICAL
TRASH
ONE
NEEDS
TO
PROCESS
WHEN
I
SEE
THEM
PUT
A
COUPLE
TONS
IN
ONE
END
AND
GET
RELATIVELY
CLEAN
MATERIAL
OUT
THE
OTHER
END
PLUS
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
IT
OFF
ITS
OWN
RESIDUAL
POWER
SOUNDS
ALMOST
LIKE
PERPETUAL
MOTION
DOESNT
IT
FRED
THE
HONEST
THING
TO
DO
WOULD
BE
TO
ADMIT
YOUR
CRITICISM
ON
SCIENTIFIC
GROUNDS
WAS
INVALID
RATHER
THAN
PRETEND
YOU
WERE
ACTUALLY
TALKING
ABOUT
ENGINEERING
FEASIBILITY
GIVEN
YOU
POSTINGS
I
CANT
SAY
I
AM
SURPRISED
THOUGH
WELL
PARDON
ME
FOR
TRYING
TO
CONTINUE
THE
DISCUSSION
RATHER
THAN
JUST
TUGGING
MY
FORELOCK
IN
DISMAY
AT
HAVING
NOT
CONSIDERED
ACTUALLY
TRYING
TO
RECOVER
THE
ENERGY
FROM
THIS
PROCESS
WHICH
IS
AT
LEAST
TRYING
TO
GO
THE
RIGHT
WAY
ON
THE
ENERGY
CURVE
NOW
WHERE
DID
I
PUT
THOSE
SACKCLOTH
AND
ASHES
I
WAS
NOT
AND
AM
NOT
PRETENDING
ANYTHING
I
AM
SO
PLEASED
YOU
ARE
NOT
SURPRISED
THOUGH
NO
IT
IS
NOTHING
LIKE
PERPETUAL
MOTION
NOTE
THAT
I
DIDNT
SAY
IT
WAS
PERPETUAL
MOTION
OR
EVEN
THAT
IT
SOUNDED
LIKE
PERPETUAL
MOTION
THE
PHRASE
WAS
SOUNDS
ALMOST
LIKE
PERPETUAL
MOTION
WHICH
I
AT
LEAST
CONSIDER
A
SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT
PROPPOSITION
THAN
THE
ONE
YOU
ELECT
TO
CRITICIZE
PERHAPS
I
SHOULD
BEG
YOUR
PARDON
FOR
BEING
TOO
PRECISE
IN
MY
USE
OF
LANGUAGE
THE
PHYSICS
IS
WELL
UNDERSTOOD
THE
ENERGY
COMES
FROM
FISSION
OF
ACTINIDES
IN
SUBCRITICAL
ASSEMBLIES
FOLKS
HAVE
TALKED
ABOUT
SPALLATION
REACTORS
SINCE
THE
PULSED
SPALLATION
NEUTRON
SOURCES
ARE
IN
USE
TODAY
AS
RESEARCH
TOOLS
ACCELERATOR
DESIGN
HAS
BEEN
IMPROVING
PARTICULARLY
WITH
SUPERCONDUCTING
ACCELERATING
CAVITIES
WHICH
HELPS
FEASIBILITY
LOS
ALAMOS
HAS
EXPERTISE
IN
HIGH
CURRENT
ACCELERATORS
LAMPF
SO
I
BELIEVE
THEY
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
I
WILL
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
PROCESS
COMES
EVEN
CLOSE
TO
APPROACHING
TECHNOLOGICAL
AND
ECONOMIC
FEASIBILITY
GIVEN
THE
MIXED
NATURE
OF
THE
TRASH
THAT
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
RUN
THROUGH
IT
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
COSTS
OF
SEPARATING
THINGS
FIRST
AND
HAVING
A
DIFFERENT
RUN
FOR
EACH
ACTINIDE
WHEN
I
SEE
THEM
DUMP
A
FEW
TONS
IN
ONE
END
AND
PULL
RELATIVELY
CLEAN
MATERIAL
OUT
THE
OTHER
ONCE
THE
COSTS
TECHNOLOGICAL
RISKS
ETC
ARE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
I
STILL
CLASS
THIS
ONE
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
THROWING
WASTE
INTO
THE
SUN
SURE
ITS
POSSIBLE
AND
THE
PHYSICS
ARE
WELL
UNDERSTOOD
BUT
IS
IT
REALLY
A
REASONABLE
APPROACH
AND
I
STILL
WONDER
AT
WHAT
SORT
OF
BURNING
RATE
YOU
COULD
GET
WITH
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
WHAT
KIND
OF
ENERGY
YOU
WOULD
REALLY
RECOVER
AS
OPPOSED
TO
WHAT
IT
WOULD
COST
TO
BUILD
AND
POWER
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
THE
ENERGY
RECOVERY
ARE
WE
TALKING
OUNCES
POUNDS
OR
TONS
GRAMS
KILOGRAMS
OR
METRIC
TONS
FOR
YOU
SI
FANS
OF
MATERIAL
AND
ARE
WE
TALKING
DAYS
WEEKS
MONTHS
OR
YEARS
DAYS
WEEKS
MONTHS
OR
YEARS
FOR
YOU
SI
FANS
HMMM
STILL
USING
A
NONDECIMATED
TIME
SCALE
I
SEE
THE
REAL
REASON
WHY
ACCELERATOR
BREEDERS
OR
INCINERATORS
ARE
NOT
BEING
BUILT
IS
THAT
THERE
ISNT
ANY
REASON
TO
DO
SO
NATURAL
URANIUM
IS
STILL
TOO
CHEAP
AND
GEOLOGICAL
DISPOSAL
OF
ACTINIDES
LOOKS
TECHNICALLY
REASONABLE
INSISTING
ON
PERFECT
SAFETY
IS
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
