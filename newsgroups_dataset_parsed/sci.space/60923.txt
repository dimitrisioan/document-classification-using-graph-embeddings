announce
that
a
reward
of
billion
would
go
to
the
first
corporation
who
successfully
keeps
at
least
person
alive
on
the
moon
for
a
year
and
with
on
offer
the
problem
of
keeping
them
alive
is
highly
likely
to
involve
more
than
just
the
lunar
environment
oh
dear
my
freighter
just
landed
on
the
roof
of
acmes
base
and
they
all
died
how
sad
gosh
that
leaves
us
as
the
oldest
residents
quick
boss
the
slime
from
yoyodyne
are
back
and
this
time
theyve
got
a
tank
man
the
guns
one
could
imagine
all
sorts
of
technologies
being
developed
in
that
sort
of
environment
greg
im
kidding
btw
although
the
problem
of
winnertakesall
prizes
is
that
it
encourages
all
sorts
of
undesirable
behaviour
witness
military
procurement
programs
and
is
probably
far
too
small
a
reward
to
encourage
what
would
be
a
very
expensive
and
high
risk
proposition
