THIS

SDIO
IS
PASSING
A

AMONG

SDIO
ORIGINALLY
FUNDED
SSTO
RESEARCH
AS
A
WAY
TO
CUT
THE
COSTS
FOR
ORBITAL
DEPLOYMENTS
OF
SPACEBASED
SENSORS
AND
WEAPNS
HOWEVER
RECENT
CHANGES
IN
SDIS
POLITICAL
MARCHING
ORDERS
AND
BUDGET
CUTS
HAVE
MADE
SSTO
LESS
OF
A
PRIORITY
TODAY
THE

IS
MORE
INTERESTED
IN
USING
DCX
AS
A
STEP
TOWARDS
A
LOWCOST

SDIO
HAS
ALREADY
DONE
BRIEFINGS
TO
OTHER
GOVERNMENT

SAID
COL
SIMON

WORDEN
SDIOS
DEPUTY
FOR
TECHNOLOGY
BUT
WORDEN
DECLINED
TO
SAY
HOW
MUCH
THE
AGENCIES
WOULD
HAVE
TO
PONY
UP
FOR
THE
PROGRAM
I
DIDNT
MAKE
COLONEL
BY
TELLING
MY

HOW
MUCH
MONEY
I
HAVE
AVAILABLE
TO

HAS
LOWERED
ITS

OFFICIALS
HAIL
THE
DCX
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
BETTER
FASTER
CHEAPER
APPROACH
TO
HARDWARE
DEVELOPMENT
THE
AGENCY
BELIEVES
THIS
PHILOSOPHY
CAN
PRODUCE
BREAKTHROUGHS
THAT
LEAPFROG
AHEAD
OF
EVOLUTIONARY
TECHNOLOGY
DEVELOPMENTS
WORDEN
SAID
THE
DCX
ILLUSTRATES
HOW
A
BUILD
A
LITTLE
TEST
A
LITTLE
APPROACH
CAN
PRODUCE
RESULTS
ON
TIME
AND
WITHIN
BUDGET
HE
SAID
THE
PROGRAM
WHICH
WENT
FROM
CONCEPT
TO
HARDWARE
IN
AROUND
MONTHS
SHOWED
HOW
TODAYS
ENGINEERS
COULD
MOVE
BEYOND
THE
MIRACLES
OF
OUR
PARENTS
TIME
THE
KEY
IS
MANAGEMENT
WORDEN
SAID
SDIO
HAD
A
VERY
LIGHT
HAND
ON
THIS
PROJECT
WE
HAD
ONLY
ONE
OVERWORKED
MAJOR
JESS
SPONABLE
ALTHOUGH
THE
NEXT
PHASE
MAY
INVOLVE
MORE
AGENCIES
WORDEN
SAID
LEAN
MANAGEMENT
AND
A
SENSE
OF
GOVERNMENTINDUSTRY
PARTNERSHIP
WILL
BE
CRUCIAL
ITS
ESSENTIAL
WE
DO
NOT
END
UP
WITH
A
LARGE
MANAGEMENT
STRUCTURE
WHERE
THE
PRICE
GOES
UP
EXPONENTIALLY
SDIOS

ALSO
WON
