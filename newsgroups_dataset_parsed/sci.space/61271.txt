RE
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTERS
WHERE
ARE
THEY
WRITES
CATALOG
THESE
TESTS
ALL
SHOW
THAT
THE
BURSTS
HAVE
AN
ISOTROPIC
DISTRIBUTIONEVENLY
SPREAD
OUT
IN
A
RADIAL
DIRECTION
AND
THEY
SHOW
SIGNS
OF
HOMOGENEITY
IE
THEY
DO
NOT
CLUMP
IN
ANY
ONE
DIRECTION
SO
UNLESS
WE
ARE
SAMPLING
THE
AREA
INSIDE
THE
DISK
OF
THE
GALAXY
WE
ARE
SAMPLING
THE
UNIVERSE
NOT
COOL
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
THE
HELL
CAUSED
THESE
THINGS
NOW
I
SUPPOSE
YOU
ARE
SAYING
WELL
WE
STIL
ONLY
MAY
BE
SAMPLING
FROM
INSIDE
THE
DISK
WELL
NOT
NECESSARILY
REMEMBER
WE
HAVE
WHAT
IS
MORE
OR
LESS
AN
INTERPLANETARY
NETWORK
OF
BURST
DETECTORS
WITH
A
BASELINE
THAT
GOES
WAAAAY
OUT
TO
BEYOND
PLUTOPIONEER
SO
WE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
WITH
ALL
OF
OUR
DETECTORS
DE
TECT
SOME
SORT
OF
DIFFERENCE
IN
ANGLE
FROM
SATELLITE
TO
SATELLITE
HERES
AN
ANALOGY
YOU
SEE
A
PLANE
OVERHEAD
YOU
MEASURE
THE
ANGLE
OF
THE
PLANE
FROM
THE
ORIGIN
OF
YOUR
ARBITRARY
COORDINATE
SYSTEM
ONE
OF
YOUR
FRIENDS
A
MILE
AWAY
SEES
THE
SAME
PLANE
AND
MEASURES
THE
ANGLE
FROM
THE
ZERO
POINT
OF
HIS
ARBITRARY
SYSTEM
WHICH
IS
THE
SAME
AS
YOURS
THE
TWO
ANGLES
ARE
DIFFERENT
AND
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
TRIANGULATE
THE
POSITION
OF
YOUR
BURST
AND
MAYBE
FIND
A
SOURCE
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
NO
ONE
HAS
BEEN
ABLE
TO
DO
THIS
UH
NO
THESE
BURST
DETECTORS
ARE
JUST
THAT
BURST
DETECTORS
THEY
HAVE
NO
ANGULAR
RESOLUTION
NOW
A
NETWORK
OF
BURST
DETECTORS
COULD
HAVE
ANGULAR
RESOLUTION
BUT
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
DECENT
SET
OF
DIFFERENT
NETWORKS
AT
THE
DISTANCES
NECCESARY
FROM
EACH
OTHER
TO
DETERMINE
IF
THEYRE
HAPPENING
IN
THE
OORT
CLOUD
OR
NOT
WE
HAVE
ONE
NETWORK
AND
TRYING
TO
MAKE
TWO
NETWORKS
OUT
OF
IT
DEGRADES
WHAT
ANGULAR
RESOLUTION
WE
HAVE
PHIL
FRAERING
SEEMS
LIKE
EVERY
DAY
WE
FIND
OUT
ALL
SORTS
OF
STUFF
HOW
THE
ANCIENT
MAYANS
HAD
TELEVISON
REPO
MAN
