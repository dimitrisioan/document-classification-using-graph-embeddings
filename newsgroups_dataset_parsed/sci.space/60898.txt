RE
SHUTTLE
LAUNCH
QUESTION
IN
ARTICLE
JCMHEADCFAHARVARDEDU
JONATHAN
MCDOWELL
WRITES
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THAT
THE
EXPECTED
ERRORS
ARE
BASICALLY
KNOWN
BUGS
IN
THE
WARNING
SYSTEM
SOFTWARE
THINGS
ARE
CHECKED
THAT
DONT
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
VALUES
IN
YET
BECAUSE
THEY
ARENT
SET
TILL
AFTER
LAUNCH
AND
SUCHLIKE
RATHER
THAN
FIX
THE
CODE
AND
POSSIBLY
INTRODUCE
NEW
BUGS
THEY
JUST
TELL
THE
CREW
OK
IF
YOU
SEE
A
WARNING
NO
BEFORE
LIFTOFF
IGNORE
IT
GOOD
GRIEF
AND
I
THOUGHT
THE
SHUTTLE
SOFTWARE
WAS
KNOWN
FOR
BEING
WELLENGINEERED
IF
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
THE
CASE
EVERY
MEMBER
OF
THE
PROGRAMMING
TEAM
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
OUT
AND
SHOT
GIVEN
THAT
IVE
HEARD
THE
SHUTTLE
SOFTWARE
RATED
AS
LEVEL
IN
MATURITY
I
STRONGLY
DOUBT
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
