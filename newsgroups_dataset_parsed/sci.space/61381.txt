WRITES
BUT
TRY
TO
LAND
A
SHUTTLE
WITH
THAT
BIG
HUGE
TELESCOPE
IN
THE
BACK
AND
YOU
COULD
HAVE
PROBLEMS
THE
SHUTTLE
JUST
ISNT
DESIGNED
TO
LAND
WITH
THAT
MUCH
WEIGHT
IN
THE
PAYLOAD
IS
HST
REALLY
THAT
MUCH
HEAVIER
THAN
A
SPACELAB
I
HATE
TO
BELABOR
THE
OBVIOUS
ONCE
AGAIN
BUT
IF
THERE
HAD
BEEN
AN
ORBITER
EMERGENCY
IN
THE
EARLY
STAGES
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
HST
DEPLOYMENT
MISSION
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
LAND
WITH
HST
IN
THE
BAY
INDEED
THEY
WERE
WORRIED
ABOUT
THAT
ONE
CONCERN
WAS
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THEY
WOULD
LOSE
A
MOTOR
OR
SOMETHING
ON
THE
WAY
UP
AND
MAKE
ORBIT
BUT
ONE
THAT
WAS
TOO
LOW
TO
GIVE
HST
A
USEFUL
LIFETIME
AGAINST
ATMOSPHERIC
DRAG
I
BELIEVE
THE
DECISION
WAS
TO
DEPLOY
HST
EVEN
IF
THE
PROJECTED
LIFETIME
WAS
AS
SHORT
AS
SIX
MONTHS
IN
FACT
WE
GOT
AN
EXCELLENT
ORBIT
ON
THE
UPPER
ENVELOPE
OF
WHAT
THE
SHUTTLE
CAN
DO
I
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
ANY
SERIOUS
CONSIDERATION
THAT
HST
MIGHT
BE
BROUGHT
DOWN
FOR
REFURBISHMENT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
THE
HORRENDOUS
COST
OF
TRANSPORTING
CLEANING
RETESTING
AND
RECERTIFYING
ALL
THE
HARDWARE
ON
THE
GROUND
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
LOST
OBSERVING
TIME
AND
THE
COST
OF
A
SECOND
DEPLOYMENT
MISSION
WITH
THE
RISKS
THAT
WE
MIGHT
NOT
GET
SUCH
A
GOOD
ORBIT
THE
SECOND
TIME
AND
YOU
WOULD
PROBABLY
STILL
NEED
A
THIRD
SERVICING
MISSION
IN
A
FEW
YEARS
AS
GYROS
AND
OTHER
COMPONENTS
WEAR
OUT
BETTER
TO
HAVE
TWO
SERVICING
MISSIONS
IN
SPACE
WHICH
COULD
WELL
HAPPEN
THAN
TO
BRING
HST
DOWN
AND
TAKE
IT
UP
AGAIN
