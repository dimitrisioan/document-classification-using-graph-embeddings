has
anyone
looked
into
the
possiblity
of
a
protoncentaur
combo
what
would
be
the
benefits
and
problems
with
such
a
combo
other
than
the
obvious
instability
in
the
xssr
now
the
centaur
for
the
altas
is
about
meters
dia
and
the
proton
is
so
thats
a
good
fit
for
their
existing
upper
stage
the
blockd
which
sets
inside
a
shround
just
under
meters
dia
i
dont
know
about
launch
loads
etc
but
since
the
centaur
survives
titan
launches
which
are
probably
worse
than
the
proton
those
titan
srbs
probably
shake
things
up
pretty
good
it
seems
feasible
except
the
centaur
is
a
very
fragile
thing
and
may
require
integration
on
the
pad
which
is
not
available
now
protons
are
assembled
and
transported
horizontially
does
anyone
know
how
much
stress
in
the
way
of
a
payload
a
centaur
could
support
while
bolted
to
a
proton
horizontally
and
then
taken
down
the
rail
road
track
and
erected
on
the
pad
the
centaur
that
is
being
built
for
would
be
a
better
bet
to
integrate
onto
the
proton
as
the
is
designed
for
the
extremely
harsh
envorinment
of
the
launch
it
is
also
closer
to
m
in
diameter
youve
hit
on
the
real
kicker
however
the
centaur
is
pressure
stabilized
it
cannot
hold
up
its
own
weight
without
pressure
in
the
tanks
additionally
the
pressure
difference
between
the
two
tanks
must
be
maintained
to
psi
that
is
rather
tight
to
be
rocking
and
rolling
on
the
train
the
pressure
stabilization
is
how
centaur
achieves
the
performance
on
numerous
occasions
when
i
was
there
the
af
wanted
to
see
what
it
would
take
to
make
a
nonpressure
stabilized
centaur
the
answer
a
centaur
not
worth
launching
the
atlascentaur
does
not
require
onpad
integration
however
the
does
i
believe
the
onpad
integration
is
to
a
great
extent
due
to
the
cleanliness
requirements
and
pfl
configuration
so
maybe
something
can
be
done
there
they
would
also
need
lox
and
lh
facilities
added
to
the
proton
pads
unless
the
new
proton
second
stage
is
actually
built
and
of
course
any
centaur
support
systems
and
facilities
no
doubt
imported
from
the
us
at
great
cost
these
systems
may
viloate
us
law
so
there
are
political
problems
to
solve
in
addition
to
the
instabilities
in
the
cis
you
mention
the
addition
of
loxlh
facilities
is
critical
as
the
centaur
tops
off
as
it
lifts
off
a
lhe
facility
is
also
needed
i
dont
know
what
the
proton
uses
for
fuel
but
since
they
are
derived
from
icbms
i
would
suspect
that
they
use
storable
propellants
which
dont
have
the
ullage
problem
that
cryos
do
if
there
is
no
cryo
at
the
sight
at
all
the
addition
of
these
systems
could
be
big
not
to
mention
the
real
tech
transfer
issues
involved
with
providing
centaur
gse
to
russia
that
issue
alone
might
be
enough
to
kill
this
idea
