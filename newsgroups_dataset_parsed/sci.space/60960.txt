KEEPING
SPACECRAFT
ON
AFTER
FUNDING
CUTS
WHY
DO
SPACECRAFT
HAVE
TO
BE
SHUT
OFF
AFTER
FUNDING
CUTS
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
COULDNT
MAGELLAN
JUST
BE
TOLD
TO
GO
INTO
A
SAFE
MODE
AND
STAY
BOBBING
ABOUT
VENUS
IN
A
LOWPOWERUSE
MODE
AND
IF
MAYBE
IN
A
FEW
YEARS
IF
FUNDING
GETS
RESTORED
AFTER
THE
ECONOMY
GETS
BETTER
HOPEFULLY
IT
COULD
BE
TURNED
ON
AGAIN
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WHY
EXACTLY
WERE
THE
APOLLO
LUNAR
EXPERIMENTS
TURNED
OFF
RATHER
THAN
JUST
SAFED
WAS
IT
POLITICAL
IE
AS
ALONG
AS
THEY
COULD
BE
USED
SOMEONE
WOULD
KEEP
BUGGING
CONGRESS
FOR
FUNDS
TURNING
THEM
OFF
KEEPS
THEM
PESKY
SCIENTISTS
OUT
OF
THE
BUREAUCRATS
HAIR
IVE
HEARD
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
AN
ACTIVE
BUT
UNCONTROLLED
SPACECRAFT
CAUSES
RADIO
NOISE
I
FIND
THAT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
COULD
BE
A
PROBLEM
IN
A
PROPERLY
DESIGNED
SAFE
MODE
THIS
SAFE
MODE
COULD
BE
A
PROGRAM
ROUTINE
WHICH
CAUSES
THE
SPACECRAFT
TO
GO
TO
LEAST
FUEL
USING
ORIENTATION
AND
ONCE
A
WEEK
MONTH
YEAR
WHATEVER
ATTEMPTS
A
SIGNAL
LOCK
ON
EARTH
AT
THAT
TIME
IF
FUNDING
HAS
BEEN
RESTORED
THE
MISSION
CAN
CONTINUE
IF
NO
SIGNAL
IS
RECIEVED
THE
SPACECRAFT
GOES
BACK
TO
THE
SAFE
MODE
FOR
ANOTHER
TIME
PERIOD
AS
WE
WOULD
KNOW
WHEN
THE
SPACECRAFT
IS
GOING
TO
TRY
TO
CONTACT
EARTH
WE
COULD
BE
PREPARED
IF
NECESSARY
AS
ANOTHER
A
SPACECRAFT
COULD
DO
AT
THE
ATTEMPTED
CONTACT
IS
BEAM
STORED
DATA
TOWARDS
EARTH
IF
SOMEONE
CAN
RECEIVE
IT
GREAT
IF
NOT
SO
ITS
LOST
AND
NO
BIG
DEAL
BY
MAKING
THE
TIME
AND
SIGNAL
LOCATION
GENERALLY
KNOWN
PERHAPS
SOMEONE
IN
THE
WORLD
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
AND
WILLING
TO
INTERCEPT
THE
DATA
EVEN
IF
THEYRE
NOT
WILLING
TO
CONTACT
THE
SPACECRAFT
I
SEE
THIS
AS
BEING
PARTICULARLY
USEFUL
FOR
SPACECRAFT
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
AN
OTHERWISE
LONG
LIFE
AND
ARE
IN
OR
ARE
GOING
TO
PLACES
WHICH
ARE
OTHERWISE
UNACCESSIBLE
JUPITERSATURN
ORBIT
EXITING
THE
SOLAR
SYSTEM
ETC
PERHAPS
THOSE
DESIGNING
FUTURE
SPACECRAFT
CASSINI
PLUTO
FLYBY
ETC
SHOULD
CONSIDER
DESIGNING
IN
A
PAUSE
MODE
IN
CASE
THEIR
SPACECRAFT
GETS
THE
AX
SOMETIME
IN
THE
FUTURE
AFTER
COMPLETION
OF
THE
PRIMARY
MISSION
PERHAPS
MARS
OBSERVER
AND
GALILLEO
COULD
HAVE
SOME
KIND
OF
ROUTINE
WRITTEN
IN
FOR
THE
POST
MISSION
DRIFT
PHASE
SO
ANY
HOLES
IN
ALL
THIS
JAMES
T
GREEN
JGREENOBOECALPOLYEDU
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
NATION
SHOULD
COMMIT
ITSELF
TO
ACHIEVING
THE
GOAL
BEFORE
THIS
DECADE
IS
OUT
OF
LANDING
A
MAN
ON
THE
MOON
AND
RETURNING
HIM
SAFELY
TO
THE
EARTH
