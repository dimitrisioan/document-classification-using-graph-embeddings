THE
MAJOR
COMPONENT
OF
ANY
REALISTIC
PLAN
TO
GO
TO
THE
MOON
CHEAPLY
FOR
MORE
THAN
A
BRIEF
VISIT
AT
LEAST
IS
LOWCOST
TRANSPORT
TO
EARTH
ORBIT
FOR
WHAT
IT
COSTS
TO
LAUNCH
ONE
SHUTTLE
OR
TWO
TITAN
IVS
YOU
CAN
DEVELOP
A
NEW
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
THAT
WILL
BE
CONSIDERABLY
CHEAPER
DELTA
CLIPPER
MIGHT
BE
A
BIT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
THIS
PERHAPS
BUT
THERE
ARE
LESS
AMBITIOUS
WAYS
OF
BRINGING
COSTS
DOWN
QUITE
A
BIT
AH
THERES
THE
RUB
AND
A
TO
BOOT
FOR
THE
PURPOSES
OF
A
CONTEST
YOULL
PROBABLY
NOT
COMPETE
IFN
YOU
CANT
AFFORD
THE
RIDE
TO
GET
THERE
AND
ALTHOUGH
LOWER
PRICED
DELIVERY
SYSTEMS
MIGHT
BE
DOABLE
WITHOUT
DEMAND
ITS
DOUBTFUL
THAT
ANYONE
WILL
DEVELOP
A
NEW
SYSTEM
COURSE
IF
A
LOW
PRICED
SYSTEM
EXISTED
THERE
MIGHT
BE
DEMAND
I
WONDER
IF
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
WAY
OF
STRUCTURING
A
CONTEST
TO
ENCOURAGE
LOW
COST
PAYLOAD
DELIVERY
SYSTEMS
THE
ACCOUNTING
METHODS
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
THE
HARDEST
TO
WORK
OUT
FOR
EXAMPLE
WOULD
YOU
ALLOW
ROCKWELL
TO
LOAN
YOU
THE
ENGINES
AND
SO
FORTH
ANY
PLAN
FOR
DOING
SUSTAINED
LUNAR
EXPLORATION
USING
EXISTING
LAUNCH
SYSTEMS
IS
WASTING
MONEY
IN
A
BIG
WAY
THIS
DEPENDS
ON
THE
HOW
SOON
THE
NEW
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
COMES
ON
LINE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
PERHAPS
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
WORTHWHILE
TECHNOLOGY
LIFE
SUPPORT
NAVIGATION
ETC
COULD
BE
DEVELOPED
PRIOR
TO
A
LOW
COST
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
YOU
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
USE
THE
EXPENSIVE
STUFF
FOREVER
BUT
ID
HATE
TO
SEE
FOLKS
WAITING
TO
DO
ANYTHING
UNTIL
A
LOW
COST
MAC
OOPS
I
MEAN
LAUNCH
SYSTEM
COMES
ON
LINE
I
GUESS
ID
SIMPLIFY
THIS
TO
SAY
THAT
WASTE
IS
A
SLIPPERY
CONCEPT
IF
YOUR
GOAL
IS
MANNED
LUNAR
EXPLORATION
IN
THE
NEXT
YEARS
THEN
PERHAPS
ITS
NOT
WASTED
MONEY
IF
YOUR
GOAL
IS
TO
EXPLORE
THE
MOON
FOR
UNDER
MILLION
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
PUT
OF
THIS
EXPLORATION
FOR
A
DECADE
OR
SO
CRAIG
CRAIG

DONT
