RE
END
OF
THE
SPACE
AGE
ODDLY
ENOUGH
THE
SMITHSONIAN
CALLS
THE
LINDBERGH
YEARS
THE
GOLDEN
AGE
OF
FLIGHT
I
WOULD
CALL
IT
THE
GRANITE
YEARS
REFLECTING
THE
PRIMITIVE
NATURE
OF
IT
IT
WAS
ROMANTIC
SWASHBUCKLING
DAREDEVILS
THOSE
DARING
YOUNG
MEN
IN
THEIR
FLYING
MACHINES
BUT
IN
REALITY
IT
SUCKED
DEATH
WAS
A
HIGHLY
LIKELY
OCCURENCE
AND
THE
ENVIRONMENT
BLEW
EVER
SEE
THE
EARLY
NAVY
PRESSURE
SUITS
THEY
WERE
MODIFIED
DIVING
SUITS
YOU
WERE
READY
TO
STAR
IN
PLAN
FROM
OUTER
SPACE
RADIOS
AND
NAV
AIDS
WERE
A
JOKE
AND
ENGINES
RAN
ON
CASTOR
OIL
THEY
PICKED
AND
CALLED
AVIATORS
MEN
WITH
IRON
STOMACHS
AND
IT
WASNT
DUE
TO
VERTIGO
ODDLY
ENOUGH
NOW
WE
ARE
IN
THE
GOLDEN
AGE
OF
FLIGHT
I
CAN
HOP
THE
SHUTTLE
TO
NY
FOR
BUCKS
NOW
THATS
GOLDEN
MERCURY
GEMINI
AND
APOLLO
WERE
ROMANTIC
BUT
LETS
BE
HONEST
PEEING
IN
BAGS
HAVING
PLASTIC
BAGS
GLUED
TO
YOUR
BUTT
EVERYTIME
YOU
NEEDED
A
BOWEL
MOVEMENT
LIVING
FOR
DAYS
INSIDE
A
VW
BUG
ROMANTIC
BUT
NOT
COMMERCIAL
THE
DCX
POINTS
OUT
A
MOST
LIKELY
NEW
GOLDEN
AGE
AN
AGE
WHERE
FAT
CIGAR
SMOKING
BUSINESS
MEN
IN
LOUD
POLYESTER
SPACE
SUITS
WILL
FILL
THE
SKYS
WITH
STRIP
MALLS
AND
USED
SPACE
SHIP
LOTS
HHHMMMMM
MAYBE
ILL
RETRACT
THAT
GOLDEN
AGE
BIT
MAYBE
IT
WAS
BETTER
IN
THE
OLD
DAYS
OF
COURSE
THEN
WELL
HAVE
WALLY
SCHIRRA
TELLING
HIS
GREAT
GRAND
CHILDREN
IN
MY
DAY
WE
WALKED
ON
THE
MOON
EVERY
DAY
MILES
NO
BUSES
YOU
KIDS
GOT
IT
SOFT
PAT
