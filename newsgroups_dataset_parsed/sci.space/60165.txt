does
anyone
have
any
info
on
the
apparent
sightings
of
vulcan
all
that
i
know
is
that
there
were
apparently
two
sightings
at
drastically
different
times
of
a
small
planet
that
was
inside
mercurys
orbit
beyond
that
i
have
no
other
info
does
anyone
know
anything
more
specific
as
i
heard
the
story
before
albert
came
up
the
the
theory
orelativity
and
warped
space
nobody
could
account
for
mercurys
orbit
it
ran
a
little
fast
i
think
for
simple
newtonian
physics
with
the
success
in
finding
neptune
to
explain
the
odd
movments
of
uranus
it
was
postulated
that
there
might
be
another
inner
planet
to
explain
mercurys
orbit
its
unlikely
anything
bigger
than
an
asteroid
is
closer
to
the
sun
than
mercury
im
sure
we
would
have
spotted
it
by
now
perhaps
some
professionals
can
confirm
that
