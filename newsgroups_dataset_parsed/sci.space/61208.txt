IN

THE

DEPLOYED
A

AFTER
IT
HAD
DEPARTED
FROM
THE

WHILE
THIS

REFLECTOR
WAS
BLANK
NPO

WAS
VERY
ACTIVE
IN
REPORTING
THAT
FUTURE
BANNER
REFLECTORS
WILL
BE
AVAILABLE
TO
ADVERTISERS
WHO
COULD
USE
A
SPACE
BASED
VIDEO
OF
THEIR
LOGO
OR
AD
PRINTED
ON
THE
BANNER
IN
A
TV
COMMERCIAL
AS
FILMED
FROM
THE

THE
SECOND
DEVELOPMENT
HAS
BEEN
THAT
SPACE
MARKETING
INC
THE
SAME
COMPANY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
MERCHANDISING
SPACE
ON
THE
CONESTOGA
BOOSTER
AND
COMET
SPACECRAFT
IS
NOW
PUSHING
THE

THE
ENVIRONMENTAL

IS
A
LARGE
INFLATABLE

STRUCTURE
OF

ADVERTISING
IS
CARRIED
BY
A
MYLAR
REFLECTIVE
AREA
DEPLOYED
BY
THE

FRAME
TO

THE

THE
SPACECRAFT
RESPONSIBLE

MAINTAINING
THE

ON

WILL
CARRY

TO
CONTINUOUSLY

THE
CONDITION
OF
THE

DELICATE
PROTECTIVE
OZONE
LAYER
ACCORDING
TO
MIKE
LAWSON
HEAD
OF
SMI
FURTHERMORE
THE
INFLATABLE
BILLBOARD
HAS
REACHED
ITS
MINIMUM
EXPOSURE
OF
DAYS
IT
WILL
BE
RELEASED
TO
REENTER
THE
EARTHS
ATMOSPHERE
ACCORDING
TO
IMI
AS
THE
BIODEGRADABLE
MATERIAL
BURNS
IT
WILL
RELEASE
OZONEBUILDING
COMPONENTS
THAT
WILL
LITERALLY
REPLENISH
THE
OZONE
LAYER
THE
REMAINING
SPACECRAFT
WILL
MONITOR
THE
ATMOSPHERE
FOR
ANOTHER
YEAR
BEFORE
IT
TOO
REENTERS
AND
BURNS
UP
AND
ADDS
TO
THE
OZONE
SUPPLY
THIS
WOULD
NOT
BE
A
CHEAP
ADVERTISEMENT
COSTING
AT
LEAST
SEVERAL
MILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
EXACT
COSTS
WERE
NOT
AVAILABLE
BUT
SMI
ESTIMATES
THAT
MARKET
EXPOSURE
WOULD
BE
THAT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WATCHED
THE
SUPERBOWL
WHERE
A
ADVERTISING
UNIT
COST
SINCE
SMI
IS
LOCATED
IN
ATLANTA
GEORGIA
IT
IS
BEING
PROMOTED
AS
BEING
AVAILABLE
IN
TIME
FOR
THE
OPENING
OF
THE
SUMMER
OLYMPICS
IN
ATLANTA
BUT
BACK
TO
BRIANS
QUESTIONS
AND
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
MORE
DETAILS
OTHER
THAN
WHAT
WAS
IN
THE
WN
NEWS
BLIP
HOW
SERIOUS
IS
THIS
PROJECT
IS
THIS
JUST
IN
THE
WILD
IDEA
STAGE
OR
DOES
IT
HAVE
REAL
FUNDING
SEE
ABOVE
AS
FOR
SERIOUS
IF
THEY
CAN
GET
M
OR
SO
MY
ESTIMATE
OF
FOR
DEVELOPMENT
COSTS
AND
A
FLIGHT
UNIT
PLUS
M
FOR
A
LAUNCH
THEN
ITS
PROBABLY
REAL
THEY
ARE
CLAIMING
TO
TAILOR
THE
ORBIT
TO
OVERFLY
SPECIFIC
LOCATIONS
AT
SPECIFIC
TIMES
FOR
OPTIMUM
ADVERTISING
IMPACT
SO
THEY
PROBABLY
CANT
PIGGY
BACK
UPON
SOMEONE
ELSES
PLANNED
LAUNCH
AND
WILL
HAVE
TO
BUY
A
DEDICATED
LAUNCH
THATS
A
M
COST
THEY
NEED
TO
RAISE
RIGHT
THERE
AND
THERE
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
SOME
LEGAL
CHALLENGES
TO
THIS
AS
WELL
NOTE
THERE
IS
ONE
POTENTIAL
LEGAL
CHALLENGE
TO
SMI
ON
THE
USE
OF
LAUNCH
VEHICLE
ADVERTISING
ALREADY
WHILE
I
DONT
THINK
THE
LEGAL
CHALLENGES
WOULD
WIN
OUT
AND
YES
I
AM
AN
AMATEUR
ASTRONOMER
AND
NO
I
DONT
REALLY
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
THIS
ADDITIONAL
LIGHT
POLLUTION
BUT
I
KNOW
OF
NO
PROHIBITION
OF
IT
THE
LEGAL
CHALLENGES
AND
COURT
FIGHTS
WOULD
PROBABLY
REMOVE
ANY
POSITIVE
ASPECTS
OF
THE
ADVERTISING
I
CAN
IMAGINE
SEVERAL
WAYS
TO
MAKE
THE
ADVERTISERS
LOOK
LIKE
LOUTS
FOR
DOING
THIS
WHICH
WOULD
CHANGE
POSITIVE
MARKET
EXPOSURE
TO
NEGATIVE
MARKET
EXPOSURE
AND
NEGATE
THE
SPACE
ADVERTISING
ADVANTAGE
WOULD
YOU
SPEND
M
TO
LOOK
LIKE
AN
IDIOT
AND
LIGHT
POLLUTION
MIGHT
NOT
BE
TOO
BAD
IF
ITS
IN
A
LOW
ENOUGH
ORBIT
AND
IT
RELIES
UPON
REFLECTED
LIGHT
ONLY
IT
WOULD
ONLY
BE
VISIBLE
FOR
A
SHORT
TIME
JUST
AFTER
LOCAL
DUSK
AND
BEFORE
DAWN
FOR
MAXIMUM
MARKET
EXPOSURE
YOU
WANT
TO
HAVE
IT
VISIBLE
JUST
AFTER
DUSK
MINIMIZING
IMPACT
ON
ASTRONOMY
SINCE
THATS
THE
TIME
OF
WORSE
SEEING
DUE
TO
DAYNIGHT
THERMAL
TURBULENCE
IT
MIGHT
STILL
BE
A
PROBLEM
BUT
PERHAPS
THERE
ARE
WAYS
TO
MITIGATE
THIS
AS
FOR
HAVING
REAL
FUNDING
NONE
THAT
I
CAN
IDENTIFY
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
EXPRESSIONS
OF
INTEREST
MADE
ON
THE
CONESTOGA
ADVERTISING
OPPORTUNITY
BUT
THAT
INCLUDED
CURIOUS
FOLKS
AND
WAS
FOR
ONLY
A
COMMITMENT
I
HAVENT
HEARD
OF
ANY
SERIOUS
FUNDING
FOR
THIS
BUT
IM
SURE
THEY
ARE
SHOPPING
THE
VENTURE
AROUND
LOOKING
FOR
SOME
MONEY
IN
ORDER
TO
FLESH
OUT
THE
CONCEPT
SOME
MORE
BUT
I
AM
CONFIDENT
THERE
ARE
NO
FIRM
OR
PAYING
CUSTOMERS
AT
THIS
TIME
AND
IF
ANYBODY
WANTS
TO
CROSSPOST
THIS
TO
SCIASTRO
PLEASE
BE
MY
GUEST
I
DONT
HAVE
POSTING
PRIVILEGES
TO
THAT
AREA
OR
AT
LEAST
I
DONT
THINK
I
DO
