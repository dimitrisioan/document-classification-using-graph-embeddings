could
go
on
and
on
and
on
here
but
i
wonder
how
many
people
read
scispace
and
of
what
powerinfluence
are
these
individuals
quick
everyone
who
sees
this
post
a
reply
that
says
hey
i
read
scispace
then
we
can
count
them
and
find
out
how
many
there
are
this
will
also
help
answer
that
nagging
question
just
what
is
the
maximum
bandwidth
of
the
internet
anyways
as
an
amateur
radio
operator
vhf
i
like
to
keep
up
with
what
is
going
up
and
for
that
matter
what
is
coming
down
too
in
about
days
i
have
learned
alot
about
satellites
current
future
and
past
all
the
way
back
to
vanguard
series
and
up
to
astro
d
observatory
space
i
borrowed
a
book
from
the
library
called
weater
satellites
i
think
it
has
a
photo
of
the
earth
with
a
tiros
type
satellite
on
it
i
would
like
to
build
a
model
or
have
a
large
color
poster
of
one
of
the
tiros
satellites
i
think
there
are
places
in
the
usa
that
sell
them
itos

my
favorite
looking
satellite
