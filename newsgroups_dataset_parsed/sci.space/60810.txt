INDIVIDUALS

EVERYONE
WHO

THIS
POST
A

NAGGING
QUESTION
JUST
WHAT

MAXIMUM
BANDWIDTH
OF
THE
INTERNET

AS
AN
AMATEUR
RADIO
OPERATOR

LIKE
TO
KEEP

BORROWED
A
BOOK
FROM
THE
LIBRARY
CALLED

THINK

HAS
A
PHOTO
OF
THE
EARTH
WITH
A
TIROS
TYPE
SATELLITE
ON
IT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BUILD
A
MODEL
OR
HAVE
A
LARGE
COLOR
POSTER
OF
ONE
OF
THE
TIROS

I
THINK
THERE
ARE
PLACES
