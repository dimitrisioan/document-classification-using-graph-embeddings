WRITES
IF
GAMMA
RAY
BURSTERS
ARE
EXTRAGALACTIC
WOULD
ABSORPTION
FROM
THE
GALAXY
BE
EXPECTED
HOW
TRANSPARENT
IS
THE
GALACTIC
CORE
TO
GAMMA
RAYS
HOW
MUCH
ENERGY
DOES
A
BURSTER
PUT
OUT
I

I
HAD
TO
TURN
TO
ONE
OF
MY
PROBLEM
SETS
THAT
I
DID
IN
CLASS
FOR
THIS
LITTLE
PROBLEM
I
DONT
HAVE
A
CALCULATOR
BUT
I
DO
HAVE
THE
PROBLEM
SET
THAT
WE
DID
NOT
TOO
LONG
AGO
SO
ILL
USE
THAT
AND
HOPE
ITS
WHAT
YOU
WANTED
THIS
IS
A
HIGHLY
SIMPLIFIED
PROBLEM
WITH
A
VERY
SIMPLE
BURST
BURSTS
ARE
USUALLY
MORE
COMPLEX
THAN
THIS
EXAMPLE
I
WILL
USE
HERE
OUR
BURST
HAS
A
PEAK
FLUX
OF
ERGS
AND
A
DURATION
OF
SECONDS
DURING
THE
FRST
SECOND
OF
THE
BURST
AND
THE
LAST
SECONDS
ITS
FLUX
IS
HALF
OF
THE
PEAK
FLUX
ITS
FLUX
IS
THE
PEAK
FLUX
THE
REST
OF
THE
TIME
ASSUME
THAT
THE
BACKGROUND
FLUX
IS
ERG
THEN
WE
HAD
TO
FIND
THE
INTEGRATED
LUMINOSITY
OF
THE
BURST
FOR
SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
SPHERES
CLOUD
RADIUS
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
GALAXY
OR
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
GALACTIC
CORONA
AND
LASTLY
AT
A
WE
INTEGRATED
THE
FLUX
OVER
ALL
TIME
TO
FIND
THE
FLUENCE
THEN
USED
THE
OLD
STANDBY
FORMULA
FOR
A
RADIUS
OF
PC
WE
FOUND
AN
L
AROUND
ERGSEC
PRETTY
ENERGETIC
FOR
CLOSE
BY
FOR
THE
CORONAL
MODEL
WE
FOUND
AROUND
ERGSEC
AND
LASTLY
FOR
THE
COSMOLOGICAL
MODEL
AN
THATS
WHAT
YOUD
CALL
MODERATELY
ENERGETIC
ID
SAY
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
ABOUT
WHAT
COULD
PUT
OUT
THAT
MUCH
ENERGY
IN
ONE
SECOND
JEREMY
