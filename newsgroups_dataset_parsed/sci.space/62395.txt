shuttle
and
pennicillin
pennicillin
if
i
have
everything
correct
was
a
highly
valuable
mycotoxin
discovered
during
it
proved
to
have
an
amazing
bacteriocidal
effect
without
human
toxicity
its
immediate
administration
showed
immediate
dramatic
results
solving
problems
that
previously
were
fatal
although
initially
enormously
expensive
to
culture
within
years
the
price
had
fallen
at
least
two
orders
of
magnitude
and
within
years
was
not
much
more
expensive
then
aspirin
penicillin
was
also
usable
for
an
amazingly
wide
class
of
infections
centoxin
is
a
drug
that
is
not
passing
fda
approval
it
promised
amazing
results
for
toxic
shock
a
rapidly
fatal
disease
it
consumed
enormous
amounts
of
funding
in
testing
and
developement
however
it
works
less
then
in
times
of
administration
and
costs
per
administration
with
no
promise
of
any
reduction
in
manufacturing
cost
the
drug
thus
costs
per
useful
case
and
is
implicated
in
a
slight
increase
in
mortality
for
some
patients
i
would
not
dare
to
compare
the
shuttle
to
pennicillin
but
to
centoxin
