this

sucking

why
we
observe

lightyears

a
misnomer
the

closer

i
recommend
studying
history
well
im
working
on
it
but
getting
a
little
impatient
so
far
ive
made
it
through
egyptian
chinese
and
greek
cultures
and
up
through
the
rennaisance
but
so
far
these
insights
just
dont
seem
to
be
gelling
perhaps
its
in
an
appendix
somewhere
in
its
own
right
though
the
history
is
kind
of
fun
lots
of
good
yarns
in
there
with
varied
and
interesting
characters
and
more
to
come
