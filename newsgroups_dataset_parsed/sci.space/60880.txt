clear
caution
warning
memory
verify
no
unexpected
errors
i
am
wondering
what
an
expected
error
might
be
sorry
if
this
is
a
really
dumb
question
but
parity
errors
in
memory
or
previously
known
conditions
that
were
waivered
yes
that
is
an
error
but
we
already
knew
about
it
id
be
curious
as
to
what
the
real
meaning
of
the
quote
is
tom
my
understanding
is
that
the
expected
errors
are
basically
known
bugs
in
the
warning
system
software
things
are
checked
that
dont
have
the
right
values
in
yet
because
they
arent
set
till
after
launch
and
suchlike
rather
than
fix
the
code
and
possibly
introduce
new
bugs
they
just
tell
the
crew
ok
if
you
see
a
warning
no
before
liftoff
ignore
it
