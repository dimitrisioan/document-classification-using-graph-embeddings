I
AINT
TALKING
THE

OR
EVEN
THE

I
AM
TALKING
THE
SMALL
MINERS
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE

A

PEOPLE
WHO
GO
OUT

OKAY
THEY
USE
MODERN

TOA
POINT
LOTS
OF
THESE
SMALL
MINERS
ARE
NO
LONGER
MINERS
THEY
ARE
PEOPLE
LIVING
RENT
FREE
ON
FEDERAL
LAND
UNDER
THE
CLAIM
OF
BEING
A
MINER
THE
FACTS
ARE
MANY
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
SUSTAINT
HEIR
INCOME
FROM
MINING
DO
NOT
OFTEN
EVEN
LIVE
THEIR
FULL
TIME
AND
DO
FOTENTIMES

HUM
DO
YOU
ENJOY
PUTTING

IN
MY
MOUTH
COME
TO
NOME
AND
MEET
SOME
OF
THESE
MINERS
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
THINGS
GO
DOWN
SOUTH
IN
THE
LOWER
I
USED
TO
VISIT
BUT
OF
COURSE
TO
BELIEVE
THE
MEDIANEWS
ITS
GOING
TO
HECK
OR
JUST
PLAIN
CRAZY
WELL
IT
SEEMS
THAT
ALOT
OF
UNIONIST
TYPES
SEEM
TO
THINK
THAT
HAVING
A
JOB
IS
A
RIGHT
AND
NOT
A
PRIVILEDGE
RIGHT
TO
THE
SAME
JOB
AS
YOUR
FORBEARERS
SEE
KENNEDYS
AND
TEL
ME
WHAT
YOU
SEE
AND
THE
FAMILIES
THEY
HAVE
MARRIED
INTO
THERE
IS
A
REASON
WHY
MANY
HISTORIANS
AND
POLISCI
TYPES
USE
UNIONIST
AND
SOCIALIST
IN
THE
SAME
BREATH
THE
MINERS
THAT
I
KNOW
ARE
JUST
YOUR
AVERAGE
HARDWORKING
PEOPLE
WHO
PAY
THERE
TAXES
AND
EARN
A
LIVING
BUT
TAXES
ARE
NOT
THE
ANSWER
BUT
MAYBE
WE
COULD
MOVE

DISCUSSION
