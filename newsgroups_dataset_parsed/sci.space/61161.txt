besides
this
was
the
same
line
of
horse
puckey
the
mining
companies
claimed
when
they
were
told
to
pay
for
restoring
land
after
strip
mining
i
aint
talking
the
large
or
even
the
mining
companies
i
am
talking
the
small
miners
the
people
who
have
themselves
and
a
few
employees
if
at
allthe
people
who
go
out
every
year
and
set
up
thier
sluice
box
and
such
and
do
mining
the
semiold
fashion
way
okay
they
use
modern
methods
toa
point
lots
of
these
small
miners
are
no
longer
miners
they
are
people
living
rent
free
on
federal
land
under
the
claim
of
being
a
miner
the
facts
are
many
of
these
people
do
not
sustaint
heir
income
from
mining
do
not
often
even
live
their
full
time
and
do
fotentimes
do
a
fair
bit
of
environmental
damage
these
minign
statutes
were
created
inthe
when
the
west
was
uninhabited
and
were
designed
to
bring
people
into
the
frontier
times
change
people
change
deal
you
dont
have
a
constitutional
right
to
live
off
the
same
industry
forever
anyone
who
claims
the
have
a
right
to
their
job
in
particular
is
spouting
nonsense
this
has
been
a
long
term
federal
welfare
program
that
has
outlived
its
usefulness
pat
hum
do
you
enjoy
putting
words
in
my
mouth
come
to
nome
and
meet
some
of
these
miners
i
am
not
sure
how
things
go
down
south
in
the
lower
i
used
to
visit
but
of
course
to
believe
the
medianews
its
going
to
heck
or
just
plain
crazy
well
it
seems
that
alot
of
unionist
types
seem
to
think
that
having
a
job
is
a
right
and
not
a
priviledge
right
to
the
same
job
as
your
forbearers
see
kennedys
and
tel
me
what
you
see
and
the
families
they
have
married
into
there
is
a
reason
why
many
historians
and
polisci
types
use
unionist
and
socialist
in
the
same
breath
the
miners
that
i
know
are
just
your
average
hardworking
people
who
pay
there
taxes
and
earn
a
living
but
taxes
are
not
the
answer
but
maybe
we
could
move
this
discussion
to
some
more
appropriate
newsgroup
