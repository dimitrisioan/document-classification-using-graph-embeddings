VERY

BASELINE

VLBI
PROJECT
TEAM
RECENTLY
CONCLUDED
A
WEEKLONG
SERIES
OF
MEETINGS
WITH
OFFICIALS
FROM
RUSSIA
AND
JAPAN
THE
MEETINGS
WERE
PART
OF
SPACE
VLBI
WEEK
HELD
AT
JPL
IN
EARLY
MARCH
AND
WERE
INTENDED
TO
MAINTAIN
COOPERATION
BETWEEN
INTERNATIONAL
SPACE
AGENCIES
PARTICIPATING
IN
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
US
SPACE
VLBI
PROJECT
A
RECENTLY
APPROVED
JPL
FLIGHT
PROJECT
SET
FOR
LAUNCH
IN
US
SPACE
VLBI
WILL
UTILIZE
TWO
EARTHORBITING
SPACECRAFT
THE
JAPANESE

VLBI
SPACE
OBSERVING
PROGRAM
SATELLITE
WITH
ITS
RADIO
TELESCOPE
AND
A
RUSSIAN
RADIOASTRON
SATELLITE
BOTH
SPACECRAFT
WILL
TEAM
UP
WITH
GROUNDBASED
RADIO
TELESCOPES
LOCATED
AROUND
THE
WORLD
TO
CREATE
A
RADIO
TELESCOPE
NETWORK
THAT
ASTRONOMERS
HOPE
WILL
EXPAND
RADIO
TELESCOPE
OBSERVING
POWER
BY
A
FACTOR
OF
JAPANS
VSOP
SATELLITE
WILL
USE
A
LIMITED
SIXHOUR
ORBIT
TO
CONDUCT
IMAGING
SCIENCE
WHILE
THE
RUSSIAN
RADIOASTRON
SPACECRAFT
WILL
EXPLOIT
A
LARGER
EARTH
ORBIT
TO
CONDUCT
EXPLORATORY
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
EACH
SATELLITE
WILL
POINT
AT
A
SOURCE
TARGET
FOR
ROUGHLY
HOURS
WHILE
APPROXIMATELY
GROUNDBASED
RADIO
TELESCOPES
WILL
SIMULTANEOUSLY
POINT
AT
THE
SAME
SOURCE
OBJECT
WHILE
WITHIN
VIEW
ON
EARTH
ACCORDING
TO
DR
JOEL
SMITH
JPLS
PROJECT
MANAGER
FOR
THE
US
SPACE
VLBI
MEETINGS
LIKE
THOSE
HELD
AT
JPL
WILL
PERMIT
JAPAN
AND
RUSSIA
WHO
HAVE
LITTLE
PREVIOUS
EXPERIENCE
IN
RADIO
INTERFEROMETRY
TO
ESTABLISH
WORKING
RELATIONSHIPS
WITH
THE
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
COMMUNITIES
THAT
WILL
BE
VITAL
DURING
THE
COMPLEX
OBSERVATIONS
REQUIRED
BY
THE
SPACE
VLBI
PROJECT
ONE
OF
OUR
MAIN
ACTIVITIES
IS
DEVELOPING
THE
METHODOLOGY
FOR
INTERNATIONAL
COORDINATION
BECAUSE
THE
TWO
SPACECRAFT
SIMULTANEOUSLY
RELY
ON
THE
CORRESPONDING
TRACKING
STATIONS
WHILE
USING
THE
GROUNDBASED
RADIO
TELESCOPES
TO
OBSERVE
THE
SAME
CELESTIAL
OBJECTS
SAID
SMITH
THREE
NEW
TRACKING
ANTENNAS
ARE
BEING
BUILT
AT
DSN
FACILITIES
AND
OTHER
THREE
OTHER
TRACKING
FACILITIES
LOCATED
IN
JAPAN
RUSSIA
AND
GREEN
BANK
WVA
THIS
GLOBAL
NETWORK
OF
GROUNDBASED
RADIO
TELESCOPES
WILL
USE
PRECISION
CLOCKS
AND
HIGHSPEED
RECORDERS
TO
COLLECT
OBSERVATION
DATA
AND
FORWARD
THE
INFORMATION
TO
A
CORRELATOR
LOCATED
AT
THE
NATIONAL
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
OBSERVATORY
IN
SOCORRO
NM
THE
CORRELATOR
WILL
COMBINE
AND
PROCESS
DATA
THEN
MAKE
IT
AVAILABLE
TO
MISSION
INVESTIGATORS
IN
MOSCOW
TOKYO
AND
JPL
VIA
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
SMITH
IS
OPTIMISTIC
THAT
THE
MASSIVE
RADIO
TELESCOPE
CREATED
BY
THE
SPACE
VLBI
NETWORK
WILL
PROVIDE
RADIO
ASTRONOMERS
WITH
BETTER
RESOLUTION
THAN
HAS
EVER
BEEN
ACHIEVED
BEFORE
BY
GROUNDBASED
RADIO
TELESCOPES
ALLOWING
ASTRONOMERS
TO
TAKE
A
CLOSER
LOOK
AT
DISTANT
OBJECTS
IN
SPACE
THERE
IS
A
LONG
HISTORY
OF
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
USING
GROUNDBASED
TELESCOPES
SAID
SMITH
WHAT
WE
INTEND
TO
DO
IS
TO
EXTEND
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
INTO
EARTH
ORBIT
OUR
GOAL
IS
TO
LOOK
DEEPER
INTO
THE
CORES
OF
GALACTIC
NUCLEI
QUASARS
AND
OTHER
ACTIVE
RADIO
SOURCES
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
DRIVES
THOSE
THINGS
WE
HAVE
SEEN
SO
FAR
WITH
RADIO
ASTRONOMY
SMITH
NOTED
THAT
IF
ONE
EXAMINES
THE
ACTIVE
GALACTIC
NUCLEI
YOULL
FIND
JETS
APPEARING
TO
SPEW
AT
SPEEDS
GREATER
THAN
LIGHT
AND
AT
ENERGY
LEVELS
THAT
ARE
MILLIONS
OF
TIMES
GREATER
THAN
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
HE
SAID
SOME
ASTRONOMERS
BELIEVE
THAT
BLACK
HOLES
MAY
BE
LOCATED
IN
THE
CORES
OF
THESE
GALAXIES
AND
THAT
THEY
MAY
FUEL
THE
JETS
SMITH
HOPES
THAT
BY
USING
SPACE
VLBI
TO
LOOK
FURTHER
INTO
THE
CORES
THIS
THEORY
MAY
BE
SUPPORTED
OR
DISPROVED
RUSSIAN
SPACEFLIGHT
HARDWARE
INCLUDING
TRANSPONDERS
AND
TRANSMITTERS
ARE
NOW
BEING
TESTED
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
JAPANESE
HARDWARE
IS
SCHEDULED
TO
ARRIVE
FOR
TESTING
LATER
THIS
YEAR
ANALYSIS
OF
THIS
HARDWARE
WILL
PERMIT
US
SCIENTISTS
AND
ENGINEERS
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
TO
MODIFY
THE
HIGHSPEED
VLBA
CORRELATOR
OPERATING
AT
THE
NRAO
IN
ORDER
TO
ACCOMMODATE
THE
ODD
DATA
PATTERNS
THAT
WILL
ORIGINATE
FROM
THE
MORE
THAN
GROUNDBASED
RADIO
TELESCOPES
INVOLVED
IN
SPACE
VLBI
SMITH
IS
PARTICULARLY
PLEASED
THAT
MEETINGS
WITH
THE
JAPANESE
AND
RUSSIAN
SPACE
AGENCY
OFFICIALS
LIKE
THOSE
HELD
AT
JPL
IN
MARCH
HAVE
PROCEEDED
SMOOTHLY
YET
HE
KNOWS
THAT
THE
POLITICAL
UNCERTAINTY
IN
RUSSIA
COULD
JEOPARDIZE
THAT
COUNTRYS
PARTICIPATION
IN
THE
PROJECT
NOTHING
IS
EVER
SMOOTH
HE
SAID
BUT
THE
RUSSIANS
HAVE
BEEN
INCREDIBLY
OPEN
WITH
US
WE
ALWAYS
ANTICIPATED
SOME
LIKELIHOOD
THAT
WE
WILL
NOT
SUCCEED
BECAUSE
OF
POLITICAL
FACTORS
BEYOND
OUR
CONTROL
YET
THERE
TENDS
TO
BE
A
WAY
OF
KEEPING
THESE
THINGS
GOING
BECAUSE
SCIENTISTS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
ARE
TRYING
HARD
AND
PEOPLE
RECOGNIZE
THE
VALUE
OF
COOPERATION
AT
THIS
LEVEL
SMITH
POINTS
OUT
THAT
THE
JAPANESE
SPACE
AGENCY
HAS
MORE
AT
STAKE
THAN
JUST
FULFILLING
AN
INTERNATIONAL
COMMITMENT
TO
A
SCIENCE
MISSION
THE
JAPANESE
HAVE
BEEN
EXTREMELY
COOPERATIVE
SINCE
INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION
IS
ESSENTIAL
TO
THEIR
SCIENCE
MISSION
HE
SAID
BUT
SMITH
ALSO
NOTED
THAT
JAPANESE
SPACE
AGENCY
OFFICIALS
LOOK
AT
THE
US
SPACE
VLBI
MISSION
AS
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
SHOWCASE
THE
TECHNOLOGY
INVOLVED
WITH
VSOP
SPACECRAFT
AND
THEIR
HIGHLY
REGARDED
MACH
V
LAUNCH
VEHICLE
YET
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
RISKS
INVOLVED
IN
UNDERTAKING
SUCH
AN
AMBITIOUS
PROJECT
JPLS
SMITH
IS
SATISFIED
THAT
PLANNING
FOR
THE
SPACE
VLBI
PROJECT
IS
BEYOND
THE
SIGNIFICANT
FINANCIAL
AND
POLITICAL
HURDLES
THAT
OTHERWISE
MIGHT
THREATEN
THE
PROJECT
FORTUNATELY
WE
HAVE
THE
VIRTUE
OF
HAVING
TWO
PARTNERS
AND
IF
EITHER
FALLS
OUT
WE
WOULD
STILL
HAVE
SOMETHING
WITH
THE
OTHER
