re
gamma

bursters
where
are
they

writes
what
evidence
indicates
that
gamma
ray
bursters
are
very
far
away
given
the
enormous
power
i
was
just
wondering
what
if
they
are
quantum
black
holes
or
something
like
that
fairly
close
by
why
would
they
have
to
be
at
galactic
ranges
gamma
ray
bursts
grbs
are
seen
coming
equally
from
all
directions
however
given
the
number
of
bright
ones
there
are
too
few
faint
ones
to
be
consistent
with
being
equally
dense
for
as
far
as
we
can
seeit
is
as
if
they
are
all
contained
within
a
finite
sphere
or
a
sphere
with
fuzzy
edges
with
us
at
the
center
these
measurements
are
statistical
and
you
can
always
hide
a
sufficiently
small
number
of
a
different
type
of
grb
with
a
different
origin
in
the
data
i
am
assuming
that
there
is
only
one
population
of
grbs
the
data
indicates
that
we
are
less
than
of
the
radius
of
the
center
of
the
distribution
the
only
things
the
earth
is
at
the
exact
center
of
are
the
solar
system
at
the
scale
of
the
oort
cloud
of
comets
way
beyond
pluto
and
the
universe
cosmological
theories
placing
grbs
throughout
the
universe
require
supernovatype
energies
to
be
released
over
a
timescale
of
milliseconds
oort
cloud
models
tend
to
be
silly
even
by
the
standards
of
astrophysics
if
grbs
were
galactic
ie
distributed
through
the
milky
way
galaxy
you
would
expect
them
to
be
either
concentrated
in
the
plane
of
the
galaxy
for
a
disk
population
or
towards
the
galactic
center
for
a
spherical
halo
population
we
dont
see
this
so
if
they
are
galactic
they
must
be
in
a
halo
at
least
light
years
in
radius
and
we
would
probably
start
to
see
grbs
from
the
andromeda
galaxy
assuming
that
it
has
a
similar
halo
for
comparison
the
earth
is
lightyears
from
the
center
of
the
galaxy
my
own
pet
theory
is
that
its
flying
saucers
entering
hyperspace
the
arent
concentrated
in
the
known
spacelanes
and
we
dont
see
many
coming
from
zeta
reticuli
and
tau
ceti
but
the
reason
i
am
asking
is
that
most
everyone
assumes
that
they
are
colliding
nuetron
stars
or
spinning
black
holes
i
just
wondered
if
any
mechanism
could
exist
and
place
them
closer
in
there
are
more
than
grb
different
models
in
the
refereed
literature
right
now
the
theorists
have
a
sort
of
unofficial
moratorium
on
new
models
until
new
observational
evidence
comes
in
