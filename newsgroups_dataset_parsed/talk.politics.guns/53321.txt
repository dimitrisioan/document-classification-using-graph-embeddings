JUST
HEARD
SOME
ANTIGUNCONTROL
PEOPLE
GIVING
THE

THE
WAY
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
OF

GETTING
KILLED
BY

IS
BETTER
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
IT
STRIKES
ME
THAT
THIS
ARGUMENT
COULD
BE
LOGICALLY
EXTENDED
AS
FOLLOWS
A
NUCLEAR
WEAPON
IS
AN
ARM
HENCE
ANYONE
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
AND
IF
SOMEONE
USES
HIS
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
TO
BLOW
UP
NEW
YORK
LA
AND
CHICAGO
THATS
OKAY
AS
LONG
AS
WE
HAVE
A
GOOD
POLICE
FORCE
CAPABLE
OF
FINDING
HIM
AND
PUTTING
HIM
IN
JAIL
WHICH
WILL
SERVE
AS
A
DETERRENT
TO
OTHERS
DO
ANY
ANTIGUNCONTROL

DISAGREE
WITH
THIS
AND
IF
SO
WHY
YES
I
AM

THESE

HAVE
NO
SELF

PURPOSES
ITS
KINDA
HARD
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
USE
AS
A
MILITIA
WEAPON
WHEN
AT
BEST
THEY
ARE
MEANT
FOR
BATTLEFIELD
USE
LOWYIELD
WEAPONS
OR
AT
WORST
FOR
INDUSTRIAL

OBLITERATION
TRANSLATION
