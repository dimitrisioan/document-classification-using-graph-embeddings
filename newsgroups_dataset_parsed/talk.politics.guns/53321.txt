just
heard
some
antiguncontrol
people
giving
the
usual
arguments
its
everyones
right
to
bear
arms
and
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
of
people
getting
killed
by
guns
is
better
law
enforcement
it
strikes
me
that
this
argument
could
be
logically
extended
as
follows
a
nuclear
weapon
is
an
arm
hence
anyone
has
a
right
to
have
nuclear
weapons
and
if
someone
uses
his
nuclear
weapons
to
blow
up
new
york
la
and
chicago
thats
okay
as
long
as
we
have
a
good
police
force
capable
of
finding
him
and
putting
him
in
jail
which
will
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
others
do
any
antiguncontrol
people
disagree
with
this
and
if
so
why
yes
i
am
progun
and
yes
i
do
disagree
with
this
statement
nuclear
weapons
in
and
of
themselves
are
dangerous
radioactive
decay
of
plutonium
and
uranium
as
well
as
the
tritium
in
the
weapon
tends
to
be
somewhat
dangerous
to
living
things
can
you
say
neutron
flux
plus
these
things
have
no
self
defense
purposes
its
kinda
hard
to
justify
their
use
as
a
militia
weapon
when
at
best
they
are
meant
for
battlefield
use
lowyield
weapons
or
at
worst
for
industrial
target
obliteration
translation
cities
and
population
centers
not
to
mention
that
for
it
to
be
used
as
a
militia
weapon
and
expect
the
user
to
live
requires
some
sort
of
launch
