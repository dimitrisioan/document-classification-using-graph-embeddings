THE
REASON
THE
FIRE
DEPARTMENT
COULDNT
FIGHT
THE
FIRE
IS
THAT
BULLETS
WERE
WHIZZING
THROUGHOUT
THE
AREA
HAD
KORESH
NOT
HAD
SUCH
A
FRIGHTENLY
LARGE
ARSENAL
MAYBE
THE
FEDS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
DECIDED
THAT
HAVING
THE
FIREDEPARTMENT
ON
THE
SCENE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
USELESS
WASTE
OF
TAXES
AND
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
HAD
A
DIFFERENT

BROKEN
OUT
IN
WACO
SO
HOW
COME
THE
FIRE
DEPARTMENT
HAD
BEEN
AT
THE

FIRE

LOUDLY
COMPLAINING
THE
WHOLE
TIME
ABOUT
BEING
DIVERTED
FROM
THEIR
OTHER
DUTIES
AND
THE
FBI
SAID
FINE
GO
HOME
AND
WELL
CALL
YOU
IF
WE
NEED
YOU
A
MILLION
THINGS
COULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
WE
DONT
KNOW
BTW
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
WACO
FD
WAS
ON
SCENE
FOR
ALL
BUT
THE
LAST
DAYS
WHATS
THE
SOURCE
OUT
OF
CURIOSITY
PERSONAL
OPINIONS
WHY
