re
waco
questions
the
us
government
has
become
a
garrotte
around
the
necks
of
its
citizens
just
as
with
a
garrotte
the
more
people
struggle
to
breathe
the
air
of
freedom
the
more
the
government
tightens
its
stranglehold
the
only
possible
outcomes
at
this
point
are
the
death
of
government
or
the
elimination
of
personal
freedom
i
think
this
is
a
little
extreme
i
am
concerned
about
a
couple
of
things
ive
seen
lately
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
is
beginning
to
enforce
political
correctness
the
first
king
verdict
was
polically
incorrect
so
the
hell
with
constutitional
protection
from
double
jeopardy
try
the
cops
again
the
bds
are
far
as
i
can
tell
didnt
do
anything
wrong
nothing
that
would
justify
the
horrable
end
they
were
subjected
too
they
were
simply
polically
incorrect
in
the
extream
i
cant
help
but
wonder
whos
next
jim
shirreffs
i
speak
for
myself
and
only
myself
