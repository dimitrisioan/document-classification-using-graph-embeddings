re
dont
knock
the
glock
was
re
my
gun
is
like
my
am
ex
card
in
article
jason
kratz
writes
all
very
true
im
going
on
what
i
have
read
and
heard
from
friends
basically
the
glock
is
great
but
i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
learn
proper
handling
because
of
the
type
of
safety
that
it
has
i
was
looking
at
a
glock
and
the
sw
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
the
safties
on
the
guns
were
very
different
the
saftey
on
the
seemed
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
course
this
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebody
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddling
around
turning
the
safety
off
personally
i
like
the
glocks
because
they
are
very
light
and
i
think
they
look
really
cool
guess
thats
why
they
use
them
in
so
many
movies
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
as
my
first
semiauto
because
of
the
safety
i
would
prefer
more
training
with
a
traditional
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of
course
thats
just
my
opinion
jason
at
the
risk
of
starting
the
my
gun
is
better
than
yours
flame
war
i
must
disagree
there
is
no
secret
in
handling
a
glock
in
fact
it
is
often
chosen
besides
its
other
merits
because
it
shoots
like
a
revolver
does
basically
it
can
limit
the
training
time
read
budget
due
to
the
fact
there
are
no
external
safties
other
than
the
trigger
hence
less
training
time
required
smith
wesson
among
other
types
are
chosen
due
to
the
fact
taht
they
do
have
the
external
safties
hammer
dropas
well
as
mag
drop
which
if
properly
used
have
saved
many
lives
when
mr
bad
snatched
the
gun
from
the
officer
and
tried
to
shoot
said
officer
the
gun
was
on
safe
and
would
not
fire
this
point
had
been
made
in
many
articles
in
various
gun
magazines
if
fact
one
author
cant
remember
who
staged
a
little
test
where
he
had
a
revolver
and
a
sw
on
safe
laying
on
a
table
and
asked
people
with
little
firearms
experience
to
on
his
signal
grab
the
gun
and
shoot
a
target
he
timed
the
people
using
each
gun
the
revolver
times
were
pretty
close
but
some
of
the
times
with
the
sw
were
in
minutes
or
the
person
just
gave
up
because
they
could
not
figure
out
the
saftey
you
dont
often
see
colt
autos
issued
due
to
the
light
trigger
which
can
be
accidentally
fired
in
a
stress
situation
opening
the
issuing
citycounty
etc
to
lawsuits
bad
press
etc
of
course
any
problem
can
be
overcome
with
enough
training
but
such
training
is
not
always
available
to
budget
crunched
departments
i
know
if
i
were
a
cop
i
would
want
something
like
a
sw
just
for
the
off
chance
of
the
gun
getting
taken
away
the
safety
doesnt
guarantee
that
mr
bad
wont
figure
it
out
and
shoot
me
but
it
could
buy
enough
time
to
draw
a
second
gun
and
shoot
mr
bad
before
its
too
late
dont
think
i
am
too
biassed
here
just
because
i
have
had
glocks
in
my
possession
at
one
time
because
i
have
had
a
as
well
in
fact
it
was
my
first
handgun
remember
the
ultimate
safety
is
you
the
operator
and
no
safety
is
going
to
stop
an
negligent
discharge
note
i
dont
say
accidental
if
you
break
the
rules
of
gun
handling
as
per
the
part
of
being
light
weight
and
looking
cool
i
agree
i
wouldnt
rule
it
out
as
a
first
purchase
just
my
tax
