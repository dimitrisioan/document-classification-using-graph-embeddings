BRAD
WHITEHURST
WRITES
THE
REST
OF
US
FALL
IN
THE
MIDDLE

IS
TOO
MUCH
VIOLENT
CRIME
IN
THE
US
BUT
TURNING
THE
WHOLE
COUNTRY
INTO
AN
OLDTIME
DODGE
CITY
REF
TO
AMERICAN
OLD
WEST
IS
NOT
THE
WAY
THATS
AN
INTERESTING
STATEMENT
THERES
QUITE
A

BEEN
STRICTLY
REGULATED
SINCE
SAID
REGULATION

BOTH
PERFECT
LEGALLY
OWNED
MACHINE
GUNS
ARENT
EVER
USED
CRIMINALLY
AND
A
COMPLETE
WASTE
OF
TIME
THE
CRIMINAL
USE
OF
MACHINE
GUNS
HASNT
CHANGE
AT
ALL
THE
RESULT

NOW
ARGUING
ABOUT

NO
DIFFERENT
THAN
OTHER
GUNS
