AS
AN
OLD
POST
OF
MINE
CAME
UP
IN
A
COLLECTION
OF
POSTS
ABOUT
THE
ACLUS
POSITION
ON
GUNCONTROL
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
NOTE
THAT
MY
OWN
POSITION
HAS
BEEN
EVOLVING
BUT
IM
STILL
NOT
SURE
HOW
TO
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
DOES
THE
ALLOW
ME
TO
HAVE
MY
OWN
NUCLEAR
DEVICE
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
DOES
NOT
PROHIBIT
IT
BUT
IT
CAN
PROBABLY
BE
ARGUED
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
YOU
CAN
OPERATE
ONE
WITHOUT
SEVERELY
IMPACTING
ON
THE
SAFETY
AND
RIGHTS
OF
OTHERS
AND
SO
MIGHT
NOT
BE
PERMITTED
ON
THAT
BASIS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
WEAPON
IN
AND
OF
ITSELF
AND
THIS
IS
ALSO
TRUE
FOR
BIOLOGICS
AND
CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
BUT
FOR
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
REASONS
POSES
A
THREAT
TO
LIVING
CRITTERS

YOU
SAY
NEUTRON
