RE
HR
A
GUN
LAW
I
CAN
LIVE
WITH
IN
ARTICLE
MEYERSLEONARDORTPDGCOM
BILL
MEYERS
WRITES
A
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
RIGHT
A
PERSON
NOT
PRO
HIBITED
BY
FEDERAL
LAW
FROM
RECEIVING
A
FIREARM
SHALL
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
OBTAIN
FIREARMS
FOR
SECURITY
AND
TO
USE
FIRE
ARMS
IN
DEFENSE
OF
SELF
FAMILY
OR
HOME
SO
YOU
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
UNLESS
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
SAYS
YOU
DONT
I
DONT
THINK
I
LIKE
THIS
VERY
MUCH
THIS
WOULD
BE
MUCH
BETTER
IF
IT
SAID
EVERYONE
EXCEPT
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
STRIPED
OF
THIS
RIGHT
BY
DUE
PROCESS
OF
LAW
OR
SOME
SUCH
THING
ALSO
I
DONT
CARE
FOR
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
STEPPING
ON
STATES
RIGHTS
REGARDLESS
OF
WHICH
STATE
RIGHT
IS
BEING
STEPPED
ON
IF
THE
CONSTITUTION
DOESNT
GIVE
THE
FEDS
SOME
POWER
THEN
THEY
HAVE
TO
JUST
SHUT
UP
ABOUT
IT
THE
ONLY
WAY
THE
FEDS
SHOULD
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
SAY
IS
IF
THE
CONSTITUTION
PROHIBITS
LOCALITIES
FROM
INFRINGING
ON
THE
RKBA
IN
WHICH
CASE
THIS
BILL
SHOULD
JUST
REITERATE
THAT
THE
RKBA
IS
GUARANTEED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
THAT
THE
FEDS
WILL
TAKE
APPROPRIATE
ACTION
IF
IT
IS
INFRINGED
