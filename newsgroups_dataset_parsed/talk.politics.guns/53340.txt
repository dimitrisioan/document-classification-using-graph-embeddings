DOES
ANYONE
REALLY
BELIEVE
THE
SWISS
HAVE
HAD
NO
WAR
WITHIN
THEIR
BORDERS
BECAUSE
EVERY
ADULT
MALE
OWNS
A
RIFLE
IM
A
GREAT
ADMIRER
OF
THE
SWISS
BUT
YEARS
OF
PEACE
ON
THEIR
TURF
HAS
ZILCH
TO
DO
WITH
GUN
OWNERSHIP
CAN
YOU
PICTURE
HITLER
WITH
PANZERS
AND
FOCKEWULFS
POISED
ON
THE
BORDER
LOSING
SLEEP
OVER
A
FEW
THOUSAND
EXPERT
RIFLEMAN
SURE
THE
SWISS
POPULATION
IS
AND
WELL
WAS
FAR
LARGER
THAN
THAT
I
THINK
YOUR
QUESTION
SHOULD
BE
LOSING
SLEEP
OVER
A
MILLION
EXPERT
RIFLEMEN
CERTAINLY
HE
COULD
HAVE
CONQUERED
SWITZERLAND
BUT
A
MILLION
ARMED
MILITIAMEN
ESPECIALLY
IN
A
MOUNTAINOUS
AREA
WHERE
TANKS
EFFECTIVENESS
IS
LIMITED
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
A
REAL
PAIN
THE
QUESTION
A
CONQUEROR
WOULD
ASK
IS
IS
IT
WORTH
THE
TROUBLE
THE
MORE
DIFFICULT
AN
INVASION
IS
THE
MORE
LIKELY
THE
ANSWER
WOULD
BE
NO
CERTAINLY
A
MILLION
RIFLEMEN
AS
OPPOSED
TO
A
PROFESSIONAL
ARMY
OF
ONLY
TEN
OR
TWENTY
THOUSAND
THE
BEST
A
COUNTRY
THE
SIZE
OF
SWITZERLAND
COULD
SUPPORT
MAKES
INVASIONS
MORE
DIFFICULT
HITLER
STAYED
OUT
OF
SWITZERLAND
BECAUSE
THE
SWISS
RUN
THE
MONEY
IN
THIS
WORLD
REALLY
IN
IM
NOT
EVEN
SURE
YOU
COULD
PROVE
THAT
TODAY
DESPITE
THE
STERIOTYPE
CERTAINLY
THE
SWISS
BANKERS
WERE
NOT
ESSENTIAL

THE
GERMAN
