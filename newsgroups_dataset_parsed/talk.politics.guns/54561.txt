your
evil
tax

oh
then
why
did
the
smoke
and
flames
start
from
three
different
places
in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
well
i
only
saw
it
start
in
one
place
a
tank
punched
a
hole
in
a
wall
and
as
it
withdrew
flames
came
out
and
spread
quickly
in
the
direction
that
a
mph
wind
was
blowing
i
saw
a
diagram
in
usa
today
yesterday
and
fires
started
at
of
the
holes
that
the
tanks
made
a
terrible
negligent
accident
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
maybe
they
couldnt
ive
often
marvelled
at
how
people
could
get
burned
alive
in
the
upstairs
of
a
story
house
on
fire
but
it
happens
all
the
time
what
if
they
were
in
sealed
rooms
trying
to
avoid
the
gas
and
didnt
know
about
the
fire
until
it
surrounded
them
remember
the
israelis
hiding
in
sealed
rooms
during
desert
storm
to
avoid
gasbearing
scuds
cripes
mark
are
you
really
a
college
student
maybe
you
ought
to
stop
worrying
about
increased
beverage
access
and
start
clearing
your
head
ever
heard
of
questioning
authority
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
ok
ill
buy
that
you
do
seem
totally
clueless
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
wellllll
they
werent
murderous
theyd
never
harmed
or
even
threatened
anybody
until
they
were
attacked
by
a
paramilitary
force
using
military
weapons
and
hardware
and
as
far
as
evidence
what
are
you
talking
about
everything
the
feds
have
said
theyve
retracted
practically
as
soon
as
they
get
questioned
in
detail
about
it
maybe
you
and
your
increased
beverage
access
buddies
sitting
around
the
bar
slurring
stuff
like
they
shoulda
killed
em
all
days
ago
dont
feel
that
way
but
then
youre
probably
one
of
those
people
still
saying
about
klinton
give
the
guy
a
chance
we
dont
even
know
what
hes
gonna
do
burp
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
no
problem
you
dont
have
any
questions
that
scare
any
of
us
most
of
our
minds
are
apparently
more
developed
than
yours
the
answer
is
yes
in
a
fcking
heartbeat
thought
experiment
would
you
be
mindlessly
down
on
your
knees
with
your
mouth
open
blissfully
sucking
up
anything
the
feds
said
if
bush
were
the
president
what
no
comeback
ok
go
ahead
say
it
read
my
lips
no
new
taxes
p
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
not
in
such
a
great
degree
bush
broke
one
promise
maybe
two
taxesguns
and
we
held
him
accountable
for
it
of
course
it
took
him
the
better
part
of
years
to
do
it
slicks
only
been
in
office
days
and
hes
broken
lots
of
them
anddd
i
imagine
hell
also
be
held
accountable
for
that
i
can
just
see
the
campaign
buttons
now
abc
anybody
but
clinton
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that
day
im
eager
to
know
hmmm
apparently
you
just
got
here
nobodys
claiming
that
it
was
anything
but
a
stupid
mistake
by
a
bunch
of
incompetent
public
employees
who
normally
dont
get
this
kind
of
scrutiny
when
the
mess
up
and
as
far
as
how
they
picked
the
davidians
who
knows
maybe
they
figured
that
nobodyd
care
about
such
a
politically
incorrect
group
as
a
bunch
of
fundies
out
on
the
texas
prairie
maybe
they
figured
theyd
just
go
in
there
and
run
roughshod
over
the
bds
during
their
religious
services
which
was
the
reason
the
feds
gave
for
the
timing
of
the
raid
rather
than
running
into
resistance
maybe
they
knew
that
the
bds
werent
anywhere
near
as
violent
as
the
feds
spin
doctors
are
trying
to
tell
the
public
maybe
they
were
afraid
to
try
this
kind
of
thing
on
the
crips
and
bloods
maybe
it
was
because
the
atfs
budget
is
up
for
approval
and
they
seem
to
favor
doing
something
dramatic
whenever
that
is
the
case
of
course
their
reasoning
doesnt
matter
only
what
they
did
and
this
time
people
are
just
paying
more
attention
to
it
and
does
bill
clinton
have
cooler
theme
music
than
darth
vader
not
if
you
mean
that
stupid
dont
stop
thinking
about
tomorrow
how
is
he
on
diabolical
laughter
all
ive
ever
heard
is
hillarys
diabolical
giggle
waffle
man
seems
to
have
lost
his
sense
of
humor
does
he
look
good
in
a
cape
dont
know
never
seen
him
in
one
he
probably
looks
fat
and
puffy
faced
just
like
in
a
suit
i
saw
him
in
the
rose
garden
the
other
day
and
i
couldnt
get
over
how
much
he
is
starting
to
look
like
teddy
kennedy
these
things
must
be
investigated
you
first
dont
worry
these
things
will
be
investigated
now
go
back
to
your
beer
you
dimwit
ive
heard
a
lot
of
people
compare
bill
clinton
to
jimmy
carter
and
id
like
to
go
on
record
as
saying
that
i
dont
think
that
its
fair
jimmy
carter
was
a
veteran
and
he
had
personal
character
and
even
though
i
cant
agree
with
carters
policies
i
always
believed
that
he
was
telling
the
truth
as
best
he
understood
it
i
cant
say
that
for
the
fat
cat
ken
whitehead
