ask
the
brits
enough
people
have
been
killed
by
rubber
bullets
that
they
now
use
them
under
only
certain
controlled
circumstances
and
they
are
fired
from
something
that
looks
like
a
tear
gas
launcher
there
are
smaller
rubber
bullets
and
pellets
for
shotguns
i
understand
that
they
are
only
intended
to
be
discouragers
ie
for
the
snapping
but
not
truly
dangerous
animal
in
general
they
do
not
seem
capable
of
really
stopping
someone
who
wants
you
or
past
you
they
are
fired
at
very
low
muzzle
velocity
the
ball
round
is
intended
for
a
load
finally
as
your
mother
warned
you
you
can
put
an
eye
out
with
that
thing
oh
ok
just
wondering
i
am
not
a
real
expert
on
weapons
i
was
just
wondering
if
they
would
do
the
job
