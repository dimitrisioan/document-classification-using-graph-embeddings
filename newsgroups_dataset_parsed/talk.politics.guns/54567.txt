NOTE
THAT
BO
GRITZ
WAS
ON
THE
POPULIST
PARTY
TICKET
WITH
DAVID
DUKE
FOR
VEEP
IN
UNTIL
HE
FOUND
OUT
THAT
DUKE
WAS
LEADING
HE
TICKET
WHEN
HE
WITHDREW
HIS
CANDIDACY
SO
GRITZ
GAVE
UP
HIS
CHANCE
TO
BE
VICE
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
US
JUST
TO
AVIOD
SUPPORTING
DUKE
ID
HARDLY
CALL
THAT
GIVING
UP
HIS
CHANCE
TO
BE
VICE
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
US
THE
CHANCE
OF
THE
POPULIST
PARTY
TICKET
WINNING
IS
ESSENTIALLY
NIL
STILL
IT
DOES
IMPLY
THAT
HE
DOESNT
WANT
TO
BE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
DUKE
ROBERT
EXACTLY
AFTER
ALL
HE
WAS
IN
THE
SAME
PARTY
PROBABLY
JUST
DIDNT
WANT
THE
BAD
PRESS
THAT
BEING
DIRECTLY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
DUKE
WOULD
BRING
CONVERSELY
IS
HIS
DISDAIN
FOR
DAVID
DUKE
SUPPOSED
TO
MAKE
US
IDEOLIZE
HIM
I
MEAN
A
STAND
AGAINST
NEONAZISM
WHOA
NOW
THATS
PROGRESSIVE
COME
ON
I
CERTAINLY
KNOW
THAT
I
WOULD
REFUSE
AND
OPENLY
DENOUNCE
MY
VICE
PRESIDENCY
IF
IT
MEANT
PUTTING
HIM
IN
CONTROL
STEPHEN
WHITE

SIMPLY
THAT
