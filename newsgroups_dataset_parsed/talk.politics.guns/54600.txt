WRITES
NAPALM
THEN
LET
THE
WOOD
STOVE
INSIDE
IGNITE
IT
FOR
HEATING
PURPOSES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
WEATHER
IN
TEXAS
EVERYONE
NOW
CLAIMS
THAT
IT
WAS
FOR

STOP
AND
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
THIS
WHOLE

IS
REDICULOUS
WHO

BURNING

LANTERNS
BURNING

CANDLES
BURNING
OR
SOMEONE
SMOKING
ETC
ETC
ETC
THE
PREMISE
IS
THAT

I
CAN
BELIEVE
AN

I
CAN
BELIEVE
AN
ACCIDENT
BY
THE
FBI
I
CAN
EASILY
BELIEVE
MASS
STUPIDITY
ON
ALL
SIDES
BUT
I
CAN
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
FBI
LIT
THIS
FIRE
INTENTIONALLY
NO
WAY
