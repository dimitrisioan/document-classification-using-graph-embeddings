the
uk
is
more
dangerous
though
you
may
be
less
likely
to
be
killed
by
a
handgun
the
average
individual
citizen
in
the
uk
is
twice
as
likely
to
be
killed
by
whatever
means
as
the
average
swiss
would
you
feel
any
better
about
being
killed
by

other
than
a

i
wouldnt
what
an
absurd
argument
switzerland
is
onefifth
the
size
of
the
uk
with
oneeigth
as
many
people
therefore
at
any
given
point
on
swiss
soil
you
are
more
likely
to
be
crow
bait
more
importantly
you
are
as
likely
to
be
killed
by
the
next
stranger
approaching
you
on
a
swiss
street
than
in
the
uk
you
are
betraying
your
lack
of
understanding
about
rate
versus
total
number
rates
are
expressed
often
as
population
therefore
if
a
place
had
deaths
and
a
population
of
the
rate
would
be
a
place
that
had
deaths
and
a
population
of
would
hav
a
rate
of
the
former
has
a
higher
rate
the
latter
a
higher
total
you
are
less
likely
to
die
in
the

simple
enuff
for

out
your
