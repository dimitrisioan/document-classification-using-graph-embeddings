public
health
experts
will
tell
you
that
you
are
far
more
likely
have
your
gun
stolen
use
it
yourself
on
a
family
member
or
have
it
used
on
you
than
you
are
to
use
it
on
an
actual
criminal
actually
they
wont
what
theyll
tell
you
is
that
if
you
add
up
the
number
of
suicides
murders
of
one
drug
dealer
by
another
legit
selfdefenses
of
a
battered
spouse
and
so
on
youll
end
up
with
a
number
that
is
much
larger
than
the
number
of
selfdefense
killings
against
strangers
committed
in
the
bedroom
btw
they
didnt
honestly
count
the
latter
either
but
lets
not
quibble
they
try
to
claim
that
comparison
is
between
the
costs
of
selfdefense
and
the
benefits
but
theyre
wrong
this
comparison
doesnt
measure
the
costs
of
selfdefense
and
it
doesnt
measure
the
benefits
either
for
example
the
goal
is
not
to
kill
the
attacker
whatever
your
relationship
to
him
but
to
stop
him
while
the
number
of
killings
may
be
proportional
to
the
number
of
stops
it
isnt
equal
anyone
who
confuses
that
comparison
with
an
honest
evaluation
is
either
lying
or
andy
