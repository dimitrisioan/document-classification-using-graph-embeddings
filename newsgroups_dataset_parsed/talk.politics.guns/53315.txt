I
BELIEVE
THIS
RAID
WAS
ILL
PLANNED
BECAUSE
THEY
ONLY
HAD
DAYS
TO
PLAN
IT
AND
IT
WAS
CONTINUED
WHEN
FAILURE
WAS
OBVIOUS
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
A
BIT
PART
IN
THE
MUCH
LARGER
POLITICAL
AGENDA
OF
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
I
WOULD
EVEN
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
LOSS
OF
ATF
AGENTS
IS
INCONSEQUENTIAL
IN
THIS
THE
CONTEXT
OF
HIS
POLITICAL
AGENDA
IT
MIGHT
EVEN
BE
BENEFICIAL
TO
HIS
AGENDA
AS
IT
HELPS
POINT
UP
JUST
HOW
EVIL
THESE
ASSUALT
WEAPONS
ARE
FURTHER
PROOF
MIGHT
BE
THAT
THE
ATF
DENIED
THEIR
AGENTS
STREET
STORIES
REPORT
REQUESTS
FOR
SUFFICIENT
FIRE
POWER
IMPORTANT
DATES
FEB
NJ
ASSEMBLY
VOTES
TO
OVERTURN
ASSAULT
WEAPON
BAN
FEB
COMPOUND
IN
WACO
ATTACKED
ON
FEB
THE
NEW
JERSEY
ASSEMBLY
VOTED
TO
OVERTURN
THE
ASSAULT
WEAPON
BAN
IN
THAT
STATE
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
IT
MIGHT
BE
A
TIGHT
VOTE
BUT
THE
SENATE
IN
NJ
WAS
GOING
TO
VOTE
TO
OVERTURN
THE
BAN
IT
WOULD
NOT
SIT
WELL
TO
HAVE
AN
EASTERN
STATE
OVERTURN
AN
ASSAULT
WEAPON
BAN
GIVEN
CLINTONS
STATED
AGENDA
ON
GUN
CONTROL
I
SUSPECT
CLINTON
GAVE
THE
ORDER
TO
GET
SOMEONE
OR
SOME
GROUP
WITH
ASSUALT
WEAPONS
AND
HAVE
THE
PRESS
PRESENT
THEY
WERE
INITIALLY
AT
THE
INCIDENT
IN
WACO
TO
RECORD
THE
EVENT
FOR
THE
TV
AUDIENCE
THE
AGENT
ON
STREET
STORIES
REPORTED
THAT
A
SUPERVISOR
WAS
URGING
THEM
ALL
TO
GET
READY
FAST
AS
THEY
KNOW
WE
ARE
COMING
I
BELIEVE
THIS
ATTACK
CONTINUED
EVEN
THO
THE
PROBABLILITY
OF
FAILURE
WAS
HIGH
BECAUSE
IT
CAME
FROM
THE
TOP
DOWN
AFTER
THE
NJ
ASSEMBLY
VOTE
THE
ATF
HAD
A
LIMITED
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
TO
COME
UP
WITH
SOMETHING
AND
THE
WACKOS
IN
WACO
FIT
THE
BILL
NICELY
RICH
I
DONT
KNOW
RICH
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
THE
CONGRESS
WAS
DEBATING
THE
BUSHMANS
CRIME
BILL
THE
INCIDENT
AT
LUBYS
CAFE
OCCURED
MOST
OF
THE
ANTIGUN
CRAP
WAS
AMENDED
OUT
OF
THE
BILL
ANYWAY
COULD
A
PRESIDENT
ORDER
GO
FIND
SOME
ASSAULT
WEAPONS
AND
BRING
THE
MEDIA
I
HOPE
NOT
FRANKLY
THE
TOONMEISTER
SCARES
ME
OF
COURSE
HAVING
A
DEMOCRATIC
MAJORITY
IN
CONGRESS
DOESNT
