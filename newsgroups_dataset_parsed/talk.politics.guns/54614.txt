BILL
GREEN
WRITES
COULD
IT
HAVE
BEEN
POSSIBLE
TO
HAVE
TAKEN
KORESH
OUTSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
AT
SOME
TIME
BEFORE
THE
FEB
RAID
YES
THE
LOCAL
SHERIFF
STATED
THAT
ANYTIME
HE
WANTED
TO
TALK
TO
KORESH
ALL
HE
HAD
TO
DO
WAS
CALL
HIM
AND
KORESH
WOULD
COME
DOWN
ONE
OTHER
POINT
IM
NO
FAN
OF
JANET
RENO
BUT
I
DO
LIKE
THE
WAY
SHE
HAD
THE
BALLS
TO
GO
AHEAD
AND
TAKE
FULL
RESPONSIBILITY
SEEMS
LIKE
THE
WAFFLE
BOY
HAD
PROBLEMS
FIGURING
OUT
JUST
WHERE
HE
STOOD
ON
THE
ISSUE
FULL
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
I
THINK
ITS
RIDICULOUS
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
EVEN
TALK
TO
JANET
RENO
UNTIL
SOMETIME
TUESDAY
HOWEVER
HE
DID
TALK
WITH
WENDELL
HUBBEL
SO
WHO
REALLY
IS
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
HOPEFULLY
THE
INVESTIGATION
WILL
ANSWER
SOME
OF
THESE
BIZARRE
QUESTIONS
