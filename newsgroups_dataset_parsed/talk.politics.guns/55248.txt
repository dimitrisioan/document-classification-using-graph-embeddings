PVASILION
WRITES
WRITES
THE
BBC
ARE
ALSO
REPORTING
THAT
BODIES
OF
BD
MEMBERS
WERE
FOUND
WITH
BULLET
WOUNDS
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
SUGGESTS
THEY
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
SHOT
ATTEMPTING
TO
LEAVE
THE
COMPOUND
DURING
THE
FIRE
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
A
MAGAZINE
EXPLODES
BULLETS
GO
FLYING
EVERY
WHERE
IMHO
THESE
GUNSHOT
WOUNDS
WERE
ACTUALLY
CAUSED
WHEN
THE
MAGAZINES
WENT
UP
UNLIKELY
AMMUNITION
IS
NOT
AS
DANGEROUS
WHEN
SIMPLY
BURNED
AS
IT
IS
WHEN
FIRED
FROM
A
GUN
THE
BRASS
CASE
IS
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
HOLDING
THE
PRESSURE
GENERATED
BY
BURNING
POWDER
AND
WILL
UNLESS
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
WALLS
OF
A
GUN
BARREL
OR
CHAMBER
SIMPLY
SPLIT
OPEN
WHILE
THIS
MAY
CAUSE
SMALL
PIECES
OF
BRASS
TO
FLY
AROUND
IT
WILL
NOT
PROPEL
THE
BULLET
WITH
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
VELOCITY
IN
FACT
IT
WAS
NOT
UNCOMMON
IN
YEARS
PAST
TO
DISPOSE
OF
OLD
LOADED
CARTRIDGES
BY
BURNING
THEM
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
WERE
NOT
CLOSE
ENOUGH
TO
TAKE
A
PIECE
OF
FLYING
BRASS
IN
THE
EYE
YOU
WERE
REASONABLY
SAFE
THUS
THE
DETONATION
OF
LOADED
MAGAZINES
OR
LOOSE
ROUNDS
MIGHT
CAUSE
SLIGHT
INJURY
BUT
WOULD
BE
UNLIKELY
TO
CAUSE
FATAL
BULLET
WOUNDS
ALANE
NOBODY
SHARES
MY
OPINIONS
I
AM
A
JELLY
DOUGHNUT
ESPECIALLY
NOT
MY
