my
gun
is

my
american

writes
observations
from
a
naive
norwegian
guns
are
made
to
kill
people
not
to
shoot
target
or
to
have
something
more
macho
than
stamps
to
collect
it
is
more
easy
to
killinjure
someone
with
a
gun
than
with
a
knife
or
a
bat
as
in
baseball
its
not
very
wise
to
compare
two
completely
different
countries
like
usa
and
lets
say
island
on
issues
like
crime
and
violence
yes
the
problem
is
people
committing
crimes
not
the
tools
beeing
used
but
should
be
taken
into
concideration
only
as
far
as
it
affects
the
crime
rate
we
have
a
very
strict
gunlegislation
in
norway
but
until
recently
it
was
possible
for
enyone
over
years
to
buy
a
shotgun
shotguns
are
used
mainly
for
hunting
in
norway
but
because
it
was
so
easy
to
accuire
one
it
was
the
most
used
gun
in
crimes
the
solution
was
to
restrict
the
sale
so
its
now
necessary
to
apply
and
register
your
shotgun
and
unbelievable
the
use
of
guns
in
crime
fell
did
the
rate
of
crime
fall
if
not
the
ban
was
of
no
use
it
is
the
rate
of
violent
crime
that
matters
not
the
tools
used
its
the
crime
stupid
there
are
now
a
new
law
against
wearing
long
knives
in
public
and
why
should
it
be
allowed
apparently
that
became
the
weapon
of
choice
after
the
shotguns
were
banned
after
that
theyll
decide
the
car
of
choice
is
the
saab
and
propose
a
ban
on
that
what
i
as
an
scandinavian
have
problems
to
understand
is
that
you
americans
have
a
more
liberal
view
on
guns
and
violence
than
on
nudity
and
sex
try
showing
a
bare
breast
on
tv
insted
of
violence
and
murder
yes
i
know
a
little
american
history
but
is
it
a
civilhuman
right
to
have
an
assault
gun
in
your
home
andor
an
handgun
in
your
car
yes
we
still
trust
honest
people
here
for
the
time
being
the
bad
english
is
not
my
fault
its
probably
the
keyboardsoftware
or
the
quality
of
the
subtext
on
tv
disclamernot
these
are
the
views
of
all
studens
at
my
university
all
norwegians
and
probably
whole
of
the
universe
