dear
sir
by
now
we
are
used
to
the
new
england
journal
of
medicines
publication
of
smallscale
studies
related
to
firearms
from
which
conclusions
are
drawn
which
are
quantum
leaps
from
the
data
followed
by
announcements
of
momentus
scientific
findings
these
are
regularly
released
to
the
press
without
the
caveats
which
riddle
the
conclusory
paragraphs
and
often
accompanied
by
an
editorial
calling
attention
to
the
findings
generally
while
they
at
least
present
a
few
interesting
data
however
meaningless
the
studies
misinterpret
statistics
and
ignore
or
belittle
serious
studies
by
criminologists
the
latest

handgun

and

a
tale
of
two
cities
by
jh
sloan

with
the
accompanying
editorial
firearms
injuries
a
call
for
science
by
two
employees
of
the
centers
for
disease
control
november
however
is
an
insult
to
the
intelligence
of
any
serious
scholar
in
any
field
and
have
so
few
data
and
so
many
flaws
that
i
feel
compelled
to
write
at
some
length
to
call
attention
to
various
major
and
minor
failings
in
no
particular
order
the
authors
misleadingly
cite
wright
et
al
ref
to
support
the
statement
that
some
have
argued
that
restricting
access
to
handguns
could
substantially
reduce
our
annual
rate
of
homicide
wright
et
al
in
fact
studied
and
rejected
that
contention
the
authors
pretended
that
vancouver
and
seattle
are
very
similar
cities
with
similar
economic
circumstances
histories
demographic
characteristics
and
the
like
in
fact
the
cities
are
very
different
with
very
different
demographic
characteristics
which
appear
to
explain
completely
the
higher
homicide
rate
in
seattle
both
cities
are
over
threeforths
nonhispanic
white
and
the
nonhispanic
white
homicide
rates
are
reported
to
be
the
same
in
seattle
and
vancouver
it
is
the
different
back
grounds
problems
circumstances
and
behaviors
of
the
various
ethnic
minorities
which
explain
the
difference
in
homicide
the
authors
pretend
they
are
evaluating
canadas
gun
law
compared
to
washington
states
but
they
do
not
examine
at
all
the
situation
in
vancouver
prior
to
the
gun
law
taking
effect
in
as
it
happens
in
the
three
years
prior
to
that
vancouver
averaged
homicides
per
year
oneeighth
involving
handguns
ref
and
in
the
seven
years
of
the
nejm
article
there
were
homicides
per
year
oneeigth
involving
handguns
surely
even
the
medical
profession
recognizes
that
one
must
look
to
see
the
prior
situation
was
before
concluding
that
a
change
made
a
difference
would
a
physician
conclude
that
a
patient
was
benefiting
from
eating
oat
bran
muffin
each
day
for
seven
years
because
his
cholesterol
level
was
without
at
least
seeing
if
it
was
before
he
started
the
regimen
the
authors
pick
two
mediumsized
cities
to
evaluate
a
national
gun
law
nothing
can
be
learned
from
such
a
tiny
and
arbitrarily
selected
sample
seattle
appears
to
have
been
selected
because
it
was
convienient
for
the
authors
rather
than
for
any
scientific
reason
would
physicians
call
something
a
scientific
study
which
involved
one
experimental
subject
and
one
dissimilar
control
had
different
arbitrarily
selected
cities
been
chosen
opposite
scientific
conclusions
would
follow
vancouvers

that
of
such

ref
the
authors
fail
to
clearly
demonstrate
that
firearms
or
handguns
are
far
more
commonly
owned
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
they
use
two
surrogate
approaches
in
pretending
to
study
the
availability
of
firearmshandguns
the
first
is
an
applesandoranges
effort
to
compare
the
number
of
carry
permits
in
seattle
to
the
number
of
registered
handguns
in
vancouver
but
the
number
clearly
understates
the
number
of
handguns
in
seattle
and
counts
primarily
protective
handgun
owners
the
second
however
tells
nothing
about
the
number
of
handguns
in
vancouver
and
counts
nonprotective
handguns
for
the
most
part
where
is
it
difficult
to
obtain
handguns
legally
for
protection
registration
figures
are
meaningless
there
are
registered
handguns
in
new
york
city
new
york
daily
news
sept
comparing
the
two
that
method
suggests
about
handguns
per
population
in
new
york
city
compared
to
in
vancouver
meaning
vancouver
has
a
greater
prevalence
of
weapons
than
new
york
city
the
second
method
of
measuring
gun
density
is
cooks
gun
prevalence
index
a
previously
validated
measure
of
intercity
differences
but
the
validation
was
by
cook
of
his
own
theory
ref
normally
second
opinions
are
sought
from
a
different
doctor
more
significantly
the
cook
index
is
based
on
the
average
of
the
percentage
of
firearms
involvement
in
suicide
and
homicide
so
the
authors
are
basically
taking
a
measure
of
misuse
unsurprisingly
gun
misuse
in
homicide
in
seattle
in
vancouver
is
related
to
gun
misuse
in
homicide
plus
suicide
divided
by
two
in
seattle
in
vancouver
the
authors
are
not
measuring
the
relative
avail
ability
of
firearms
or
of
handguns
in
seattle
and
vancouver
the
authors
misstate
the
laws
of
both
washington
and
canada
they
neglect
to
mention
the
significant
fact
that
washington
has
a
waiting
period
and
background
check
prior
to
the
purchase
of
a
handgun
and
that
provisions
exist
in
canadian
law
for
owning
and
carrying
handguns
for
personal
protection
the
authors
also
make
it
appear
that
it
is
more
difficult
to
get
a
handgun
legally
in
canada
than
is
actually
the
case
the
authors
ignore
all
other
factors
which
might
explain
the
differences
in
crime
rate
beyond
some
vague
mention
of
the
penalities
provided
by
law
and
the
roughest
of
estimates
of
clearence
for
one
particular
offense
homicide
involving
a
firearm
there
is
no
measure
of
the
differences
in
the
number
of
law
enforcement
officers
their
aggressiveness
in
making
arrests
for
gun
law
violations
in
the
two
jurisdictions
arrest
rates
for
other
offenses
conviction
rates
actual
sentences
imposed
for
gunrelated
crimes
violent
crimes
without
guns
or
gun
law
violations
or
incarceration
rates
whereas
social
scientists
would
attempt
to
measure
and
hold
for
such
differences
the
authors
of
the
nejm
tale
of
two
cities
fail
even
to
mention
most
factors
related
to
crime
control
the
authors
dismiss
claims
that
handguns
are
an
effective
means
for
protection
unless
the
criminal
is
killed
such
is
not
the
case
criminologists
ref
have
found
that
almost
americans
annually
use
handguns
for
protection
from
criminals
and
that
using
a
gun
for
protection
reduces
the
liklihood
that
a
crime
rape
robbery
assault
will
be
completed
by
the
criminal
and
reduces
the
likelihood
of
injury
to
the
victim
it
is
interesting
nonetheless
that
the
authors
reported
the
same
number
four
of
civilian
justifiable
homicides
without
firearms
in
each
city
but
that
less
restrictive
seattle
accounted
for
of
the
reported
civilian
justifiable
homicides
involving
firearms
the
centers
for
disease
control
which
funded
the
study
editorially
praised
the
paper
ref
saying
it
applied
scientific
methods
to
examine
a
focus
of
contention
betweeb
advocates
of
stricter
regulation
of
firearms
particularly
handguns
there
is
nothing
in
the
paper
which
could
possibly
be
mistaken
for
scientific
methods
by
a
sociologists
or
criminologists
the
vancouverseattle
study
is
the
equivolent
of
testing
an
experimental
drug
to
control
hypertension
by
finding
two
ordinarylooking
middleclass
white
males
one
aged
and
the
other
and
without
first
taking
their
vital
signs
administering
the
experimental
drug
to
the
while
giving
the
a
placebo
then
taking
their
blood
pressure
and
on
finding
the
younger
man
had
a
lower
blood
pressure
announcing
in
a
special
article
a
new
medical
breakthrough
it
would
be
nice
to
think
that
such
a
study
would
neither
be
funded
by
the
cdc
or
printed
by
the
nejm
since
the
longstanding
antigun
biases
of
the
nejm
and
the
cdc
make
them
willing
to
present
shoddy
research
as
scientific
breakthroughs
in
special
articles
and
editorials
relating
to
firearms
we
are
obligated
to
correct
the
record
by
notifying
the
news
media
and
those
with
congressional
and
executive
oversight
over
the
activities
of

free

someone
once
wrote
statistics
are
like
a
bikini
what
they
real
is
suggestive
but
what
they
conceal
is
vital
the
problem
is
demonstrated
by
the
most
recent
entry
in
a
long
line
of
scientific
research
purporting
to
show
a
causal
link
between
gun
availability
and
homicide
funded
by
the
federal
government
and
published
last
year
in
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
the
study
compared
homicide
rates
in
seattle
and
vancouver
and
suggested
that
a
handgun
ban
may
reduce
the
rate
of
homicide
in
a
community
the
nine
medical
doctors
who
published
handgun
regulations
crime
assaults
and
homicide
essentially
reasoned
in
three
steps
despite
many
historical
social
and
demographic
similarities
vancouver
has
a
markedly
lower
homicide
rate
because
its
stricter
gun
regulations
make
guns
less
available
the
second
step
in
their
reasoning
seems
indisputable
the
overall
homicide
rate
in
seattle
for
the
period
was
per
popuation
compared
with
in
vancouver
homicide
is
definitely
more
common
in
seattle
the
question
then
becomes
why
the
authors
present
a
believable
although
not
entirely
accurate
case
to
support
the
notion
as
claimed
in
the
third
step
of
their
reasoning
that
vancouvers
handgun
regulations
are
much
more
stringent
but
their
evidence
on
the
difference
in
gun
availabilty
is
indirect
and
unpersuasive
indeed
they
acknowledge
that
direct
evidence
on
the
point
does
not
exist
they
offer
two
fragments
of
inferential
data
in
support
of
the
claim
that
guns
are
more
available
in
seattle
but
for
all
anybody
knows
as
a
matter
of
empirical
fact
the
opposite
could
be
true
we
are
therefore
being
asked
at
the
conclusion
of
the
study
to
believe
that
a
difference
in
gun
availability
explains
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
when
a
difference
in
gun
availability
has
not
itself
been
established
indeed
the
situation
is
even
more
troublesome
the
first
of
the
two
indirect
bits
of
evidence
is
a
difference
between
the
number
of
concealed
weapons
permits
issued
in
seattle
and
the
number
of
restrictedweapons
permits
issued
in
vancouver
differences
between
the
two
cities
in
the
permit
regulations
render
these
two
numbers
strictly
noncomparable
the
second
bit
of
evidence
is
cooks
gun
prevalence
index
which
stands
at
percent
for
seattle
but
only
percent
for
vancouver
cooks
index
however
does
not
measure
the
relative
prevalence
of
gun
ownership
in
various
cities
it
measures
gun
misuseit
is
an
average
of
the
percentage
of
homicides
and
suicides
involving
firearms
in
the
present
case
the
index
shows
only
that
in
homicides
and
suicides
firearms
are
more
likely
to
be
used
in
seatte
than
in
vancouver
to
take
cooks
index
as
a
measure
of
general
firearms
availability
it
must
be
assumed
that
the
proportional
involvement
of
guns
in
homicides
and
suicides
is
directly
related
to
their
relative
availability
in
the
general
population
but
this
is
exactly
what
the
authors
are
seeking
to
prove
to
assume
what
one
is
seeking
to
prove
then
to
prove
it
on
the
basis
of
that
assumption
does
ot
constitute
scientific
evidence
for
anything
even
if
we
were
to
grant
on
the
basis
of
no
compelling
evidence
that
guns
are
less
common
in
vancouver
we
might
still
question
what
causes
what
the
authors
attribute
seattles
higher
crime
rate
to
a
higher
rate
of
gun
ownership
but
it
might
well
be
argued
that
low
crime
or
homicide
rates
reduce
the
motivation
for
average
citizens
to
obtain
gunsin
other
words
that
crime
rates
explain
the
variation
in
gun
ownership
not
vice
versa
in
fact
it
was
once
commonly
argued
that
great
britains
low
rate
of
violent
crime
was
a
function
of
that
nations
strict
gun
laws
and
the
consequent
low
rate
of
gun
ownershipuntil
british
researcher
colin
greenwood
found
that
great
britain
had
enjoyed
low
rates
of
violent
crime
for
many
decades
before
strict
firearms
controls
were
enacted
to
invoke
an
ancient
methodological
saw
correlation
is
not
cause
nor
do
the
problems
with
this
study
end
with
its
lack
of
direct
data
on
gun
ownership
the
authors
say
seattle
and
vancouver
are
similar
in
many
ways
implying
that
they
differ
mainly
in
gun
availability
gunlaw
stringency
and
crime
rates
this
is
an
evident
attempt
to
establish
the
ceteris
paribus
condition
of
a
sound
scientific
analysisthat
all
else
is
equal
among
things
being
compared
clearly
the
two
cities
are
similar
in
some
ways
but
a
closer
look
reveals
differences
in
ways
that
are
relevant
to
their
respective
crime
or
homicide
rates
the
cities
are
closely
matched
in
what
percentage
of
their
population
is
white
percent
and
percent
but
seattle
is
about
percent
black
while
vancouver
is
less
than
percent
vancouvers
minority
population
is
overwhelmingly
asian
so
although
the
authors
show
that
th
two
cities
are
approximately
comparable
on
a
half
dozen
readily
available
demographic
indicators
they
have
not
shown
that
all
potentially
relevant
sources
of
variation
have
been
ruled
out
in
fact
the
differences
in
racial
compositions
of
the
two
cities
is
particularly
relevant
in
light
of
the
studys
breakdown
of
homicide
rates
according
to
the
race
of
the
victim
for
the
white
majority
the
homicide
rates
are
nearly
per
in
seattle
in
vancouver
the
differing
overall
homicide
rates
in
the
two
cities
are
therefore
due
entirely
to
vastly
different
rates
among
racial
minorities
for
blacks
the
observed
difference
in
homicide
rate
is
to
and
for
hispanics
to
methodoligical
complexities
render
the
asian
comparison
problematic
but
it
too
is
higher
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
racial
minorities
are
much
more
likely
to
be
the
victims
of
homicide
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
the
white
majority
is
equally
likely
to
be
slain
in
either
city
since
the
nearly
initial
difference
in
homicide
reates
between
the
cities
is
due
exclusively
to
or
differences
between
minority
groups
it
is
fair
to
ask
why
postulated
difference
in
gun
availability
or
gunlaw
strigency
would
matter
so
dramatically
to
minorities
but
not
matter
at
all
to
whites
can
differential
gun
availability
explain
why
blacks
and
hispanicsbut
not
whitesare
so
much
more
likely
to
be
killed
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
studies
in
the
united
states
incidentally
do
not
show
large
or
consistent
racial
differences
in
gun
ownership
or
are
other
explanations
more
plausible
could
the
disparity
between
canadian
and
american
rates
of
poverty
among
racial
minorities
have
anything
to
do
with
it
what
are
the
relative
rates
of
drug
or
alcohol
abuse
of
homelessness
among
each
ctys
minority
population
the
city
of
seattle
runs
the
largest
shelter
for
homeless
men
west
of
the
mississippi
unemployment
among
young
centralcity
nonwhite
men
in
the
united
states
usually
exceeds
percent
what
is
the
comparable
canadian
percentage
the
crucial
point
is
that
canada
and
the
united
states
differ
in
many
ways
as
do
cities
and
population
subgroups
with
the
two
countries
absent
more
detailed
analysis
nearly
any
of
these
many
ways
might
explain
part
or
all
of
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
in
gross
comparisons
such
as
those
between
seattle
and
vancouver
all
else
is
not
equal

this
study
acknowledge
that
racial
patterns
in
homicide
result
in
a
complex
picture
they
do
not
acknowledge
that
the
ensuing
complexities
seriously
undercut
the
main
thrust
of
their
argument
they
also
acknowledge
that
socioeconomic
status
is
probably
an
important
confounding
factor
in
our
comparison
remarking
further
that
blacks
in
vancouver
had
a
slightly
higher
mean
income
in
than
the
rest
of
vancouvers
population
given
the
evidence
presented
in
the
article
it
is
possible
that
all
of
the
difference
in
homicide
rates
between
seattle
and
vancouver
results
from
greater
proverty
among
seattles
racial
minorities
but
the
authors
pay
no
further
attention
to
this
possibility
since
detailed
information
about
household
incomes
according
to
race
is
not
available
for
vancouver
the
largely
insurmountable
methodological
difficulties
confronted
in
gross
comparative
studies
of
this
sort
can
be
illustrated
with
as
simple
example
if
one
were
to
take
all
us
couties
and
compare
them
in
terms
of
pervalence
of
gun
ownership
and
crime
or
homicide
rates
one
would
find
an
astonishing
pattern
counties
with
more
guns
have
less
crime
would
one
conclude
from
this
evidence
alone
that
guns
actually
reduce
crime
or
would
one
insist
that
other
variables
also
be
taken
into
account
in
this
example
the
hidden
variable
is
city
size
guns
are
more
common
in
small
towns
and
rural
areas
whereas
crime
is
a
bigcity
problem
if
researchers
failed
to
anticipate
this
variable
or
lacked
the
appropriate
data
to
examine
its
possible
consequences
they
coud
be
very
seriously
misled
in
the
study
at
hand
the
authors
matched
two
cities
for
size
but
not
for
minority
poverty
rates
or
other
hidden
variables
and
their
results
are
impossible
to
interpret
in
the
editorial
firearm
injuries
a
call
for
science
accompanying
the
study
two
officials
from
the
centers
for
disease
control
lauded
the
authors
for
applying
scientific
methods
to
a
problem
of
grave
public
heath
significance
but
in
attempting
to
draw
causal
conclusions
from
nonexperimental
research
the
essence
of
scientific
method
is
to
anticipate
plausible
alternative
explanations
for
the
results
and
try
to
rule
them
out
absent
such
effort
the
results
may
well
seem
scientific
but
are
little
more
than
polemics
masquerading
as
serious
research
that
this
study
is
but
one
of
a
number
of
recent
effortsall
employing
practical
identical
research
designs
and
published
in
leading
scientific
journals
is
cause
for
further
