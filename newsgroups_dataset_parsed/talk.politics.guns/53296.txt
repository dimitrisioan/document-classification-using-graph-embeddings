VANCOUVER

THE

COMPARED

HOMICIDE

THE

BECOMES
WHY

ALTHOUGH
NOT

TO

THE
NOTION
AS
CLAIMED
IN

THAT

THEIR

IS
INDIRECT

INDEED
THEY
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT

THEY

TWO
FRAGMENTS

OF
THE

THAT

IN

BUT
FOR
ALL
ANYBODY
KNOWS
AS
A
MATTER
OF
EMPIRICAL
FACT
THE
OPPOSITE
COULD
BE
TRUE
WE
ARE
THEREFORE
BEING
ASKED
AT
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
THE

TO
BELIEVE
THAT
A

IN

EXPLAINS
THE

IN

WHEN
A

NOT

INDEED
THE

THE

IS
AN
AVERAGE
OF
THE

ONLY
THAT
IN

ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
USED
IN

THAN
IN
VANCOUVER
TO
TAKE

AS

IT
MUST
BE
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
PROPORTIONAL
INVOLVEMENT
OF

IN

IS
DIRECTLY
RELATED
TO
THEIR

BUT
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE

ARE

TO
PROVE
TO
ASSUME
WHAT

IS

THEN
TO

IT

STILL

THE

ATTRIBUTE

IT
MIGHT

VICTIMS
OF
HOMICIDE
IN
SEATTLE
THAN
IN
VANCOUVER
THE
WHITE
MAJORITY
IS
EQUALLY
LIKELY
TO
BE
SLAIN
IN
EITHER
CITY
SINCE
THE
NEARLY
INITIAL
DIFFERENCE
IN
HOMICIDE
REATES
BETWEEN
THE
CITIES
IS
DUE
EXCLUSIVELY
TO
OR
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
MINORITY
GROUPS
IT
IS
FAIR
TO
ASK
WHY
POSTULATED
DIFFERENCE
IN
GUN
AVAILABILITY
OR
GUNLAW
STRIGENCY
WOULD
MATTER
SO
DRAMATICALLY
TO
MINORITIES
BUT
NOT
MATTER
AT
ALL
TO

WHY

SO
MUCH
MORE

TO

IN
SEATTLE

IN
VANCOUVER
STUDIES

NOT

COULD
THE

BETWEEN

RATES
OF

AMONG

HAVE

TO

WITH

PERCENT
WHAT
IS
THE
COMPARABLE
CANADIAN
PERCENTAGE
THE
CRUCIAL
POINT
IS
THAT
CANADA
AND
THE
UNITED
STATES
DIFFER
IN
MANY
WAYS
AS
DO
CITIES
AND
POPULATION
SUBGROUPS
WITH
THE
TWO
COUNTRIES
ABSENT
MORE
DETAILED
ANALYSIS
NEARLY
ANY
OF
THESE
MANY
WAYS
MIGHT
EXPLAIN
PART
OR
ALL
OF
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
HOMICIDE
RATES
IN
GROSS
COMPARISONS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
BETWEEN
SEATTLE
AND
VANCOUVER
ALL
ELSE
IS
NOT
EQUAL
THE
AUTHORS
OF
THIS
STUDY
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
RACIAL
PATTERNS
IN
HOMICIDE
RESULT
IN
A
COMPLEX
PICTURE
THEY
DO
NOT
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THE
ENSUING
COMPLEXITIES
SERIOUSLY
UNDERCUT
THE
MAIN
THRUST
OF
THEIR
ARGUMENT
THEY
ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
SOCIOECONOMIC
STATUS
IS
PROBABLY
AN
IMPORTANT
CONFOUNDING
FACTOR
IN
OUR
COMPARISON
REMARKING
FURTHER
THAT
BLACKS
IN
VANCOUVER
HAD
A
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
MEAN
INCOME
IN
THAN
THE
REST
OF
VANCOUVERS
POPULATION
GIVEN
THE
EVIDENCE
PRESENTED
IN
THE
ARTICLE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
ALL
OF
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
HOMICIDE
RATES
BETWEEN
SEATTLE
AND
VANCOUVER
RESULTS
FROM
GREATER
PROVERTY
AMONG
SEATTLES
RACIAL
MINORITIES
BUT
THE
AUTHORS
PAY
NO
FURTHER
ATTENTION
TO
THIS
POSSIBILITY
SINCE
DETAILED
INFORMATION
ABOUT
HOUSEHOLD
INCOMES
ACCORDING
TO
RACE
IS
NOT
AVAILABLE
FOR
VANCOUVER
THE
LARGELY
INSURMOUNTABLE
METHODOLOGICAL
DIFFICULTIES
CONFRONTED
IN
GROSS
COMPARATIVE
STUDIES
OF
THIS
SORT
CAN
BE
ILLUSTRATED
WITH
AS
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
IF
ONE
WERE
TO
TAKE
ALL
US
COUTIES
AND
COMPARE
THEM
IN
TERMS
OF
PERVALENCE
OF
GUN
OWNERSHIP
AND
CRIME
OR
HOMICIDE
RATES
ONE
WOULD
FIND
AN
ASTONISHING
PATTERN
COUNTIES
WITH
MORE
GUNS
HAVE
LESS
CRIME
WOULD
ONE
CONCLUDE
FROM
THIS
EVIDENCE
ALONE
THAT
GUNS
ACTUALLY
REDUCE
CRIME
OR
WOULD
ONE
INSIST
THAT
OTHER
VARIABLES
ALSO
BE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IN
THIS
EXAMPLE
THE
HIDDEN
VARIABLE
IS
CITY
SIZE
GUNS
ARE
MORE
COMMON
IN
SMALL
TOWNS
AND
RURAL
AREAS
WHEREAS
CRIME
IS
A
BIGCITY
PROBLEM
IF
RESEARCHERS
FAILED
TO
ANTICIPATE
THIS
VARIABLE
OR
LACKED
THE
APPROPRIATE
DATA
TO
EXAMINE
ITS
POSSIBLE
CONSEQUENCES
THEY
COUD
BE
VERY
SERIOUSLY

IN

THE

NOT

IN
