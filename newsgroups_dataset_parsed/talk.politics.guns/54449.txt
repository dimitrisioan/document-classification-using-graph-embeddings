APOLOGY
WAS
LUSER
I
WAS
SHOCKED
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
SUBJECT
OF
MY
LAST
RELY
TO
AWESLEY
WAS
LUSER
THAT
WAS
CERTAINLY
NOT
MY
INTENTION
I
MEANT
TO
LEAVE
THE
SUBJECT
LINE
UNCHANGED
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
NNTP
SERVER
I
USE
AT
COLUMBIA
MUST
HAVE
PUT
IN
THAT
SUBJECT
LINE
IN
PROTEST
OVER
PROBLEMS
WITH
MY
HEADER
THAT
WAS
RATHER
RUDE
OF
THEM
BUT
BEGGARS
CANT
BE
CHOOSERS
I
SUPPOSE
IN
ANY
CASE
I
DIDNT
DO
IT
AND
I
APOLOGIZE
TO
AWESLEY
FOR
THE
APPARENT
INSULT
