RE
CLINTON
JOINS
LIST
OF
GENOCIDAL
SOCIALIST
LEADERS
SNIP
DRAUGHNIITMAXIITEDU
MARK
DRAUGHN
WRITES
THE
PRESIDENT
IS
NOT
COMPETENT
TO
PLAN
OR
JUDGE
THE
PLANNING
OF
SUCH
A
RAID
NOR
DOES
HE
NEED
TO
BE
HIS
JOB
IS
TO
SET
BASIC
POLICIES
AND
MANAGE
THE
PEOPLE
UNDER
HIM
IF
CLINTON
INSTRUCTED
RENO
TO
PRESERVE
LIVES
AND
IF
SHE
CONFIRMED
THAT
THE
PLAN
FOR
THE
RAID
WAS
A
SAFE
AS
COULD
BE
THEN
HE
DID
HIS
JOB
THE
PRESIDENT
SHOULD
NOT
INVOLVE
HIMSELF
IN
THE
MINOR
DETAILS
OF
THESE
KINDS
OF
OPERATIONS
THIS
SORT
OF
MICROMANAGEMENT
ONLY
LEADS
TO
DISASTER
AS
WAS
DEMONSTRATED
SO
WELL
IN
VIETNAM
BUT
THE
RAID
WENT
BAD
OVER
CIVILIANS
HAVE
BEEN
KILLED
IN
A
CONTRONTATION
WITH
US
AUTHORITIES
NOW
CLINTON
ENTERS
THE
PICTURE
IN
A
BIG
WAY
WILL
CLINTON
START
AN
INVESTIGATION
OR
WILL
HE
TRY
TO
SQUASH
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
INVESTIGATE
IS
HE
A
RESPONSIBLE
LEADER
OR
IS
HE
ONLY
INTERESTED
IN
PROTECTING
THE
IMAGE
OF
HIS
ADMINISTRATION
WELL
ALL
FIND
OUT
AS
THIS
UNFOLDS
EXCELLENT
POINT
MARK
WE
SHOULD
ALL
REMEMBER
THAT
IF
NIXON
HADNT
TRIED
TO
COVER
UP
THE
MISGUIDED
ACTIONS
OF
SOME
OF
HIS
SUBORDINATES
IN
THE
WATERGATE
BURGLARY
THE
SCANDAL
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
BROUGHT
DOWN
HIS
PRESIDENCY
SO
FAR
KLINTON
SEEMS
TO
BE
STONEWALLING
THIS
THE
SAME
WAY
TRICKY
DICK
DID
HIS
WHOLE
CASE
SEEMS
TO
BE
WE
DIDNT
DO
ANYTHING
WRONG
HOWEVER
IF
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
INVESTIGATION
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
THE
GOVT
DID
DO
SOMETHING
WRONG
AND
HE
TRIED
TO
COVER
IT
UP
THEN
THATS
AN
IMPEACHABLE
CRIME
I
BELIEVE
PERHAPS
HE
IS
INADVERTENTLY
COOKING
UP
HIS
OWN
SCANDAL
CAN
YOU
SAY
WACOGATE
LITTLE
NEIGHBOR
YA
KNOW
THIS
BEING
PART
OF
THE
LOYAL
OPPOSITION
IS
KINDA
FUN
FOR
A
CHANGE
I
SURE
AM
GLAD
I
GET
TO
BITCH
ABOUT
CLINTON
RATHER
THAN
HAVING
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THOSE
POOR
SAPS
STUCK
TRYING
TO
DEFEND
HIM
I
WONDER
HOW
MICHAEL
KINSLEY
LIKES
BEING
PART
OF
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
