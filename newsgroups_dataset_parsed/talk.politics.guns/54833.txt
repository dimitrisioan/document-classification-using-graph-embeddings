MR
NICE
GUY
WRITES
FLASH
OVER
IS
A
FREQUENT
OCCURRENCE
WITH
INDOOR
FIRES
A
FIRE
WILL
START
SMALL
AND
IN
ONE
LOCATION
AND
HEAT
THE
AIR
THE
TEMPERATURE
IN
THE
ROOM
BUILDS
UP
AND
THEN
EVERYTHING
INFLAMMABLE
IN
THE
ROOM
CATCHES
FIRE
AT
ONCE
THIS
MAY
HAVE
OCCURRED
IN
THE
BD
COMPOUND
I
HAVE
HEARD
REPORTS
THAT
THE
WINDOWS
WERE
COVERED
WHICH
WOULD
PERMIT
A
FIRE
TO
START
UNNOTICED
BY
THOSE
OUTSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
WHEN
THE
FIRE
GOT
BIG
ENOUGH
AND
BROKE
THROUGH
THE
WALLS
IT
APPEARED
TO
BE
STARTED
IN
TWO
PLACES
BUT
WAS
REALLY
ONE
BIG
FIRE
THE
HOUSTON
CHRONICLE
LAST
THURSDAY
MAYBE
WEDNESDAY
SAID
THAT
THE
INTERIOR
OF
WALLS
HAD
BEEN
COVERED
WITH
HAY
BALES
TO
HELP
PROTECT
AGAINST
BULLETS
MANY
OF
YOU
KNOW
HOW
FAST
DRY
HAY
BURNS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LARGE
QUANTITIES
OF
TEAR
GAS
INSERTED
INTO
THE
BUILDING
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
WERE
IN
A
ROOM
FREE
OF
TEAR
GAS
THEY
WOULD
TRY
TO
SEAL
THE
DOOR
TO
KEEP
OUT
THE
TEAR
GAS
WHEN
THEY
LEARNED
THAT
A
FIRE
HAD
BROKEN
OUT
IT
WAS
TOO
LATE
FOR
THEM
TO
ESCAPE
THEY
WERE
TRAPPED
BY
THE
FLAMES
IN
THEIR
SAFE
ROOM
IN
ADDITION
THE
GAS
IS
SPECIFICALLY
DESIGNED
TO
FORCE
EYES
CLOSED
AND
THE
VICTIM
TO
VOMIT
HOW
FAST
COULD
YOU
LEAVE
YOUR
BURNING
OFFICE
OR
HOME
IF
YOUR
EYES
WERE
CLOSED
AND
YOU
WERE
RETCHING
VIOLENTLY
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
FBI
WAS
NOT
RECORDING
THE
FINAL
ASSAULT
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
WANTED
TO
HAVE
TAPES
TO
SHOW
THEIR
AGENTS
OF
THE
THE
FBI
OVERCOMING
THE
FORCES
OF
EVIL
AKA
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
THE
TAPES
WOULD
ALSO
ALLOW
THE
FBI
TO
PROVE
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
USING
EXCESSIVE
FORCE
