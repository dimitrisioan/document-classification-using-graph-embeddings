though
i
agree
this
is
not
the
place
to

guns
i
note
in

that
a
number
of
gun
apologists
seem
to
have
ignored
the
words
well
regulated
in
their
distorted
interpretations
of
the
second

though
david
sternlight
pushes
the
envelope
of
credibility
by
claiming
that
talkpoliticsguns
is
not
the
place
to
discuss
guns
or
the
meaning
of
the
second
amendment
it
seems
he
would
rather
post
to
millions
of
people
out
of
relative
ignorance
of
the
subject
than
to
follow
the
currently
active
threads
discussing
exactly
this
topic
which
at
least
explore
the
fallacies
of
his
erroneous
claim
and
at
most
explode
them
basic
fact
mr
sternlight
the
right
described
is
a
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
not
a
right
of
the
people
to
form
a
militia
a
right
of
a
militia
to
keep
and
bear
arms
or
a
right
of
wellregulated
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
this
should
be
apparent
from
a
simple
reading
of
the
sentence
for
the
other
arguments
i
suggest
you
check
