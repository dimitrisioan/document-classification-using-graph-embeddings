WACKOS
UNITE
DO
YOU
KNOW
HOW
MANY
DEATHS
EACH
YEAR
ARE
CAUSED
BY
SELFINFLICTED
GUN
SHOT
WOUNDS
BY
PEOPLE
WEARING
THIGH
HOLSTERS
THERE
ARE
ROUGHLY
FATAL
FIREARMSRELATED
ACCIDENTS
EACH
YEAR
THE
LARGE
MAJORITY
INVOLVE
RIFLES
AND
SHOTGUN
THERE
ARE
UNDER
FATAL
HANDGUN
ACCIDENTS
EACH
YEAR
I
REALLY
DOUBT
ALL
OF
THOSE
OCCUR
WHILE
THE
PISTOL
IS
HOLSTERED
SO
THE
NUMBER
OF
SELFINFLICTED
GUNSHOT
WOUNDS
BY
PEOPLE
WEARING
THIGH
HOLSTERS
IS
PROBABLY
WELL
UNDER
PER
YEAR
IF
YOU
FALL
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
LAND
ON
THE
HANDGUN
OR
CAUSE
A
SUDDEN
BLOW
THE
GUN
WILL
DISCHARGE
HANDGUNS
DESIGNS
HAVE
INCLUDED
A
HAMMER
BLOCK
SINCE
AROUND
OR
EARLIER
THIS
IS
A
METAL
PART
WHICH
PHYSICALLY
SEPERATES
THE
CARTRIDGE
AND
THE
FIRING
PIN
EVEN
UNDER
IMPACT
THE
GUN
CANNOT
FIRE
THE
HAMMER
BLOCK
IS
CONNECTED
TO
THE
TRIGGER
AND
IS
PULLED
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
AS
THE
TRIGGER
IS
PULLED
AS
A
RESULT
MODERN
PISTOLS
CAN
FIRE
ONLY
IF
THE
TRIGGER
IS
PULLED
OR
IN
SOME
CASES
IF
THEY
ARE
COCKED
BY
HAND
AND
THEN
DROPPED
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
KILLED
IN
THIS
MANNER
FAR
OUTWEIGHS
THE
NUMBER
OF
DEATHS
CAUSED
BY
ANIMAL
ATTACKS
OR
WACKO
ATTACKS
COMBINED
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
ANIMAL
ATTACKS
BUT
THERE
ARE
MURDERS
EACH
YEAR
AND
UNDER
DIE
IN
THE
MANNER
YOU
SUGGEST
IF
ONLY
OF
THE
MURDERS
WERE
KILLINGS
BY
WACKOS
YOU
WOULD
BE
WRONG
WORSE
THERE
ARE
ALSO
RAPES
AND
AGGRAVATED
ASSAULTS
EACH
YEAR
THESE
NUMBERS
MAKE
VIOLENT
ATTACKS
AND
PREVENTING
THEM
THOUSANDS
OF
TIMES
MORE
SIGNIFICANT
THAN
THE
ACCIDENTS
YOU
ARE
WORRIED
ABOUT
THESE
FIGURES
BY
THE
WAY
ARE
FROM
