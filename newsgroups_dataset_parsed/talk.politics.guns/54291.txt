THE
KINDLER
GENTLER
NEWSGROUP
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
NO
NOT
EXACTLY
THE
ONLY
REASON
FOR
THIS
SORT
OF
RESTRICTION
IS
THE
POSSIBLE
ENDANGERMENT
OF
OTHERS
A
POORLY
MAINTAINED
RIFLE
IS
DANGEROUS
BUT
ONLY
TO
THE
USER
SINCE
IT
DOESNT
ENDANGER
OTHERS
THERE
IS
NO
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
SUCH
RESTRICTIONS
I
REMIND
YOU
OF
SHRAPNEL
I
CONSIDER
A
REASONABLE
SPACE
LIMITATION
BUT
MAKE
NO
MISTAKE
A
GUN
BLOWING

A

TO
THOSE

MY

AT

WE

THE

IS
IT
THE

OF

SO
WE
DO

THE

OF
BEING

HENCE
WE
DRAW
A
MILE
RESTRICTION
OR
A
NUKE
AND
DRAW
A
MILE
RESTRICTION
TO
ME
THEY
AL
SUFFER
FROM
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
FLAW
THAT
THEY
RESTRICT
BASED
UPON
THE
INSTRUMENT
RATHER
THAN
PLACING
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
USAGE
SQUARELY
UPON
THE
SHOULDERS
OF
THE
USER
PERHAPS
SEN
METZENBAUM
DECLARING
THE
BARRETT
LIGHT
FIFTY
AN
ASSAULT
RIFLE
HAS
MADE
THIS
MORE
APPARENT
TO
ME
SINCE
THE
BARRETT
HAS
ONLY
RANGE
AND
ACURRACY
GOING
FOR
IT
THEY
HAVE
DETERMINED
THAT
THEIR
LIVES
ARE
WORTH
THE
EFFORT
TO
PROTECT
THEIR
HOMES
AND
FAMILIES
USING
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
CLOSE
TO
HOME
WILL
NOT
ACCOMPLISH
THIS
I
DISAGREE
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
A
HOUSE
CAN
BE
REBUILT
MUCH
MORE
EASILY
THAN
MY
FAMILY
ONCE
I
HAVE
DIED
I
ASSUME
THAT
WORD
WOULD
GET
TO
THE
CITIZENS
THAT
SUCH
AN
ATTACK
WAS
PLANNED
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
THE
TACTICAL
AND
STRATEGIC
IMPLICATIONS
CHANGE
QUITE
A
BIT
PERSONALLY
MY
HOME
IS
WORTH
SAY
TWENTY
MARTIANS
INTENT
ON
TAKING
OVER
THE
WORLD
MY
FAMILY
ALL
OF
THEM
THE
BALANCING
ACT
HERE
IS
HARD
TO
JUDGE
SITTING
AT
MY
DESK
THERE
IS
HOWEVER
ANOTHER
PROBLEM
IN
ANY
CASE
OF
CIVIL
WAR
THE
STRENGTH
OF
THE
MILITIAS
FIGHTING
ON
EACH
SIDE
SHOULD
REFLECT
THE
POPULAR
WILL
IF
THE
PUBLIC
IS
SPLIT
VERSUS
THEN
THE
MINORITIES
MILITIAS
SHOULD
BE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
SUCH
A
NEED
FOR
POPULAR
SUPPORT
WOULD
HOPEFULLY
PREVENT
INSURRECTIONS
UNLESS
THE
PEOPLE
REALLY
WERE
BEHIND
THE
REBELS
BUT
HEAVY
WEAPONS
OWNED
BY
A
SMALL
FRACTION
OF
THE
MILITIA
COULD
DISTORT
THIS
WHAT
IF
THE
MINORITY
INCLUDED
ALL
THE
TANK
AND
ARTILLERY
OWNERS
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
CASE
ALREADY
GIVEN
THAT
HEAVY
WEAPONS
ARENT
COMMONLY
OWNED
BY
THE
CITIZENRY
WITH
SUCH
LOW
NUMBERS
OBVIOUSLY
DUE
TO
COST
I
DONT
THINK
THE
SUPERIOR
WEAPONS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
OF
GREAT
EFFECT
AGAINST
A
NUMERICALLY
SUPERIOR
FOE
FURTHERMORE
IT
IS
EVEN
MORE
DOUBTFUL
THEIR
TRAINING
INCLUDES
PROPER
TACTICAL
MOVEMENTS
THAT
BEST
UTILIZE
TANKS
WHEREAS
THE
COMMONLY
RIFLEMAN
IS
NOT
SO
HAMPERED
IN
EFFECTIVENESS
I
THINK
IT
IS
VITAL
TO
AVOID
SUCH
A
SITUATION
WHERE
A
SMALL
MINORITY
WOULD
HAVE
A
REASONABLE
CHANCE
OF
GAINING
POLITICAL
POWER
THROUGH
VIOLENCE
TO
PREVENT
THIS
IT
MAY
BE
NECESSARY
TO
GIVE
CONTROL
OF
HEAVY
WEAPONS
EG
THOSE
WHICH
ONLY
A
SMALL
NUMBER
OF
INDIVIDUALS
WOULD
OWN
AND
WHOSE
FIREPOWER
WOULD
GROSSLY
DISTORT
THE
RELATION
BETWEEN
POPULAR
SUPPORT
AND
MILITARY
STRENGTH
TO
SOMEONE
OTHER
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
MILITIAMEN
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
A
GOOD
THING
BUT
I
THINK
IT
IS
THE
LESSER
OF
TWO
EVILS
WHOEVER
CONTROLS
THESE
WEAPONS
MUST
BE
A
DEMOCRATIC
BODY
RESPONSIVE
TO
THE
WILL
OF
THE
PEOPLE
I
HAD
ENVISIONED
THAT
THE
ARMORER
PERHAPS
THE
OFFICERS
OF
A
SELECT
GROUP
AND
THE
LIKE
WOULD
EXERCISE
CONTROL
OVER
THE
HEAVIER
MORE
COMPLEX
WEAPONS
BUT
IF
JOE
BOB
OWNS
AN
OLD
SHERMAN
TANK
I
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
ASK
HIM
TO
GIVE
IT
UP
FOLLOW
ORDERS
FROM
THE
OFFICERS
YES
SINCE
THE
EXPENSE
OF
A
TANK
IS
SO
LARGE
THOUGH
CHANCES
ARE
IT
WOULD
BE
JOINTLY
PURCHASED
AND
SHOULD
THEREFORE
BE
JOINTLY
MAINTAINED
AND
OPERATED
HERE
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFULL
ABOUT
WHICH
STATE
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
CERTAINLY
ONE
ROLE
OF
THE
MILITIA
IS
TO
OVERTHROW
A
REPRESSIVE
GOVERNMENT
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
COMPLETELY
DESTRUCTIVE
TO
THAT
END
FOR
THAT
SAME
GOVERNMENT
TO
CONTROL
THE
MILITIAS
ARMS
BUT
THE
UNITED
STATES
HAVE
SEVERAL
LEVELS
OF
GOVERNMENT
EACH
ABLE
TO
ACT
INDEPENDENTLY
BUT
NOT
ALL
LIKELY
TARGETS
OF
REBELION
AS
SUCH
REBELIONS
AGAINST
STATE
AND
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
ARE
VERY
UNLIKELY
I
THINK
THEREFORE
THAT
THE
STATE
OR
POSSIBLY
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
COULD
SAFELY
BE
ALLOWED
TO
KEEP
THE
SELECT
MILITIAS
HEAVY
WEAPONS
THE
RISK
OF
ABUSE
WHILE
STILL
SOMETHING
TO
CONSIDER
IS
FAR
LESS
THAN
THE
SIMILAR
RISK
WERE
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IN
CONTROL
THIS
ILL
AGREE
WITH
TO
A
POINT
THE
STATE
HAVING
CONTROL
OVER
THE
HEAVY
WEAPONS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
THE
STATE
TO
HAVE
THEM
CENTRALLY
LOCATED
KEEP
THEM
SPREAD
OUT
SUCH
THAT
THE
ABILITY
OF
THE
STATE
TO
LOCK
THEM
UP
ISNT
SO
EASY
OTHERWISE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
STATE
CONTROL
WOULD
REST
ON
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
GOVERNOR
AND
MILITIA
OFFICERS
THAT
IS
EAXCTLY
WHY
I
THINK
THEY
SHOULD
BE
REMOVED
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
SHOULD
PRIVIDE
THE
MILITIAS
HEAVY
WEAPONS
AND
HIGHLYTRAINED
SPECIALISTS
FOR
THE
REASONS
I
HAVE
OUTLINES
ABOVE
I
THINK
THESE
HEAVY
WEAPONS
TANKS
ARTILLERY
AIRCRAFT
ETC
ARE
BETTER
OFF
BEING
KEPT
BY
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
THAN
BY
A
SMALL
NUMBER
OF
INDIVIDUALS
HOWEVER
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
SHOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
WITHOUT
THE
SUPPORT
TO
THE
PEOPLE
IDEALLY
THE
GENERAL
MILITIA
UNDER
THE
DIRECT
CONTROL
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
UNDER
THE
DIRECTION
OF
DEMOCRATIC
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
WOULD
OPPERATE
TOGETHER
BUT
EVEN
IN
THE
WORST
CASE
THE
GENERAL
MILITIA
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
FUNCTIONAL
WITHOUT
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
SIMILARLY
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
SHOULD
BE
INCAPABLE
OF
ACTION
WITHOUT
THE
AID
OF
THE
GENERAL
MILITIA
IM
HAVING
A
HARD
TIME
SEEING
HOW
THESE
HEAVY
WEAPONS
FAIRLY
FEW
IN
NUMBERS
COULD
NOT
BE
EASILY
WIELDED
BY
A
FEW
PEOPLE
WITH
GOVERNMENT
SUPPORT
JUST
AS
YOU
ARGUED
ABOVE
THAT
THE
WEAPONS
SHOULD
BE
DIVVIED
UP
AND
UNDER
DEMOCRATIC
CONTROL
SO
ONE
SIDE
DOESNT
HAVE
ALL
OF
THEM
I
CANT
SEE
WHERE
THIS
SITUATION
IS
ALLEVIATED
IN
HAVING
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
HOLDING
ALL
THE
WEAPONS
AND
THE
UNORGANIZED
MILITIA
BEING
THE
INFANTRY
I
THINK
A
BETTER
MIX
IS
CALLED
FOR
BUT
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
THE
FEDERAL
ARMY
SHOULD
RELY
UPON
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
AND
THE
UNORGANIZED
MILITIA
FOR
THE
BULK
OF
ITS
INFANTRY
UNITS
CONSIDER
THEN
THE
EFFECT
OF
REMOVING
THE
NATIONAL
GUARDS
INFANTRY
AND
PLACING
THE
GUARD
UNDER
THE
CONTROL
OF
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
THE
GOVERNMENTCONTROLED
SELECT
MILITIA
COULD
NOT
FIGHT
EFFECTIVELY
WITHOUT
INFANTRY
SUPPORT
PROVIDED
BY
THE
GENERAL
MILITIA
AN
INHERENTLY
INFANTRY
ORGANIZATION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
GENERAL
MILITIA
COULD
FUNCTION
ALTHOUGH
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
WITHOUT
THE
BACKING
OF
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
AND
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
WE
HAVE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
SIDE
WITH
THE
GOVERNMENTCONTROLLED
FORCES
AND
IF
THEYVE
ALL
THE
EQUIPMENT
AN
INFANTRY
FORCE
THE
SIZE
WOULD
BE
IN
TROUBLE
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
THAT
HEAVY
STUFF
SAY
TANKS
OFFSET
BY
THE
LOCAL
TROUPS
HAVING
A
FEW
AND
ANTITANK
WEAPONS
IN
THEIR
ARMORY
THESE
WOULD
BE
MUCH
MORE
USEFUL
TO
INFANTRY
THAN
THE
TANK
WOULD
BE
WHEN
COST
AND
TRAINING
REQUIREMENTS
ARE
FIGURED
IN
I
SUPPOSE
IM
QUIBBLING
OVER
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
HEAVY
EQUIPMENT
BUT
A
MECHANIZED
INFANTRY
UNIT
IS
WHAT
BUILDS
DIKES
IN
TIMES
OF
FLOOD
SETS
UP
DISASTER
RELIEF
CITIES
AND
THE
LIKE
I
WOULD
MUCH
RATHER
SEE
THESE
THINGS
HANDLED
BY
THE
LOCAL
GENERAL
MILITIAS
SO
WOULD
I
BUT
THE
RESOURCES
OFTEN
ARENT
AVAILABLE
TO
OUTFIT
LOCAL
UNITS
WELL
ENOUGH
THUS
WE
WILL
CERTAINLY
HAVE
TO
CALL
IN
OTHERS
AND
A
MECHANIZED
UNIT
CARRIES
MORE
STUFF
FASTER
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
PERHAPS
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
ISNT
AS
CLOSE
TO
MY
CONCEPTION
OF
THE
SELECT
MILITIA
AS
I
THOUGHT
I
WAS
CONSIDERING
THEM
TO
BE
THE
HEAVY
WEAPONSARMOR
ARM
OF
THE
MILITIA
NOT
THE
INFANTRY
ARM
OF
THE
REGULAR
ARMY
PERHAPS
OUR
IDEAS
OF
HEAVY
WEAPONS
ARE
DIFFERENT
I
THINK
MAIN
BATTLE
TANKS
SELFPROPELLED
ARTILLERY
AND
AND
UP
FIELD
PIECES
ARE
HEAVY
STUFF
TROOP
CARRIERS
TON
TRUCKS
HUMVEES
OLD
TANKS
HOWITZERS
ARE
MORE
THE
STUFF
OF
A
MECHANIZED
INFANTRY
ACTUALLY
THIS
IS
WHAT
THE
GUARD
UNITS
IN
IOWA
ARE
CURRENTLY
FIELDING
IN
SOME
UNITS
PERHAPS
IT
IS
JUST
MY
INNATE
FEAR
OF
HAVING
THE
REAL
HEAVY
EQUIPMENT
UNDER
STATE
CONTROL
WITH
LITTLE
BUT
NUMBERS
AND
LIGHT
STUFF
TO
ACT
AS
A
DETERRENT
ALLOWING
MAIN
BATTLE
TANKS
TO
THE
STATES
SHOULD
BE
BALANCED
WITH
ANTITANK
CAPABILITY
IN
THE
LOCAL
RANKS
SIMILARLY
LOCAL
UNITS
WOULD
NEED
TO
BAND
TOGETHER
QUICKLY
HENCE
SMALL
AND
FAST
RESPONSE
MEANS
MECHANIZED
INFANTRY
FINALLY
THE
MILITIA
IS
MORE
THAN
JUST
FIGHTING
EQUIPMENT
IS
NEEDED
FOR
OTHER
RESPONSES
THE
FEDERAL
ARMY
IM
CONVINCED
SHOULD
HAVE
A
VERY
MINUMUM
OF
