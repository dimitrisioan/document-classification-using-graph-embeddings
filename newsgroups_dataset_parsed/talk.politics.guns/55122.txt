I
AM
SICK
DISMAYED
DISCOURAGED
AND
ASHAMED
OF
OUR
ADMINISTRATION
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THE
US
NOW
HAS
THEIR
OWN
LITTLE
TIENAMEN
SQUARE
THE
FBI
IS
PORTRAYING
KORASH
AS
A
PSYCHOPATH
DOING
A
DELIBERATE
MASS
SUICIDE
ETC
POSSIBLY
POSSIBLY
NOT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
TEAR
GAS
USED
GOD
BLESS
AMERICA
LAND
OF
THE
FREE
PAST
TENSE
WELL
MAYBE
I
AM
OVERREACTING
BUT
I
SEE
ON
THE
TV
AS
I
AM
TYPING
WHERE
GOVT
SPOKSEWOMAN
THE
NEW
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
KNOWN
TO
BE
ALMOST
RABID
ABOUT
PRIVATE
OWNERSHIP
OF
GUNS
WANTS
TO
BAN
ASSAULT
GUNS
AND
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IS
SAYING
THE
FBI
HAD
AMAZING
RESTRAINT
THEN
FALLS
BACK
INTO
THE
OFFICIAL
GOVERENMENT
LINE
ABOUT
HOW
THE
BD
WERE
GUITY
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
AND
WERE
INTO
IT
IN
AN
ONGOING
BASIS
AND
SO
ON
AM
I
HAVING
A
VAIN
HOPE
THAT
AN
HONEST
INVESTIGATION
WILL
OCCUR
ON
THIS
THING
OR
WILL
IT
SIMPLY
BE
WHITEWASHED
UNDER
THE
RUG
AND
BUSINESS
AS
USUAL
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
BE
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
DAY
IN
THE
NEW
ORDER
WHO
WILL
BE
GIVEN
THE
OFFICIAL
TITLE
OF
THOUGHT
POLICE
I
WONDER
WHAT
A
LOAD
OF
CRAP
THE
BDS
HAD
ABSOLUTELY
NO
RIGHT
TO
FIRE
UPON
THE
BATF
AGENTS
IF
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
WHO
THEY
WERE
AT
FIRST
THEN
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
SURRENDERED
IMMEDIATELY
WHEN
THEY
DID
REALIZE
WHO
THEY
WERE
DEALING
WITH
LITTLE
GROUPS
OF
LOONIES
DO
NOT
GET
TO
DECIDE
JUST
WHAT
LAWS
THEY
WILL
OBEY
OR
DISOBEY
OR
WHAT
SORTS
OF
WARRANTS
ARE
JUSTIFIED
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
US
THEY
GET
THEIR
SAY
AT
THE
VOTING
BOOTH
AND
IF
THEIR
PERSONAL
WANTS
ARE
NOT
BACKED
BY
THE
MAJORITY
OF
VOTERS
THEN
TOO
BAD
IF
THEY
WANTED
TO
KEEP
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
THEN
THEY
COULD
APPLY
FOR
THE
PROPER
PERMITS
IF
THEY
HAD
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
WARRANT
THEN
THEY
GET
TO
ARGUE
THAT
IN
COURT
IN
NO
EVENT
DO
THEY
GET
TO
ESTABLISH
THEIR
OWN
LITTLE
NATION
INSIDE
OUR
OWN
AND
PRETEND
THAT
OUR
LAWS
AND
LAWENFORCEMENT
PERSONEL
HAVE
NO
JURISDICTION
WITHIN
THEIR
BORDERS
YOU
LIVE
ON
US
TERRITORY
YOU
LIVE
BY
US
LAWS
PERIOD
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
A
CONGRESSMAN
SURE
THE
SITUATION
WAS
HANDLED
BADLY
BY
BOTH
THE
BATF
AND
THE
FBI
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ALL
SO
EASY
TO
DETAIN
KORESH
AND
HIS
CORE
MEMBERS
WHILE
THEY
WERE
OUT
IN
THE
STREETS
OF
WACO
THE
BATF
THREATENED
WITH
BUDGET
CUTS
WAS
TRYING
FOR
A
PROPAGANDA
COUP
AND
DRAGGING
THE
PRESS
ALONG
FOR
THE
BIG
COMMANDOSTYLE
ASSAULT
IS
PROOF
OF
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ROASTED
FOR
BOTH
THEIR
IMCOMPETANCE
AND
THEIR
MINDSET
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THEY
DID
HAVE
THE
LEGAL
RIGHT
TO
DO
WHAT
THEY
DID
ONCE
THE
ATTACK
WAS
BEGUN
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
PRESSED
ON
AND
FINISHED
IT
RATHER
THAN
LET
AN
INTERMINABLE
SITUATION
LIKE
THAT
TAKE
ROOT
THE
FBI
ALSO
USED
POOR
JUDGEMENT
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
WAYS
BUT
AGAIN
THE
LAWS
WE
VOTERS
HAVE
APPROVED
OR
THE
LAWMAKERS
WHO
CREATED
THEM
GAVE
THEM
THE
RIGHT
TO
DO
WHAT
THEY
DID
IF
BATF
AND
THE
FBI
ARE
LATTERDAY
GESTAPO
IT
IS
BECAUSE
THE
VOTERS
HAVE
ALLOWED
THEM
TO
BECOME
THAT
WAY
WACO
WAS
PURE
AMERICANA
MILITARIST
MENTALITY
RELIGIOUS
FANATICISM
AND
UNADULTERATED
VIOLENCE
ALL
ROLLED
INTO
ONE
EXPERIENCE
WE
GET
WHAT
WE
PAY
FOR
OR
VOTE
FOR
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
RESULT
OF
MANY
CHOICES
WE
HAVE
MADE
OVER
THE
YEARS
DONT
BLAME
THEM
BLAME
OURSELVES
WE
MADE
THEM
WE
ARE
THEM
