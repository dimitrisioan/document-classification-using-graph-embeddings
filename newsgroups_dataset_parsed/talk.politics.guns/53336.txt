thanks
to
the
nra
the
atf
is
prohibited
from
researching
the
effectiveness
of
using
taggants
in
explosives
taggants
are
a
cheap
and
technologically
feasible
microscopic
additive
that
would
help
investigators
at
crime
scenes
like
the
world
trade
center
bombing
trace
the
explosives
involved
i
want
this
man
to
tell
me
how
in
the
hell
you
can
take
the
explosives
used
in
the
wtc
bombing
considering
that
the
consensus
seems
to
be
that
the
explosive
was
a
fertilizerbased
one
ammonium
nitrate
to
be
exact
of
which
about
tons
disappears
per
year
if
i
recall
the
stat
correctly
i
dont
have
it
here
just
one
more
disregarding
of

to
