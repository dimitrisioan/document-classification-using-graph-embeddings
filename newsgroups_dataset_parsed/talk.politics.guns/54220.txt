holdings
and
is
putting
cnn
up
for
sale

to
band
together
and
buy
cnn
as
our
voice
wouldnt
that
be
sumpinbroadcast
the
truth
for
a
change
and
be
able
to
air
a
favorable
progun
item
or
two
i
would
like
to
see
this
happen
i
dont
think
it
will
i
dont
think
the
average
gunowner
will
take
any
notice
of
what
is
happening
until
they
break
down
his
door
but
i
will
go
on
record
publicly
to
the
effect
that
i
will
contribute
a
minimum
of
to
the
buyout
fund
if
it
can
be
organized
and
made
viable
anybody
else
want
to
put
their
money
where
their
mouth
is
there
ar
million
gun
owners
out
there
if
and
its
a
big
and
not
very
realistic
if
we
got
hold
of
cnn
the
antigun
bullshit
would
stop
right
there
why
wont
it
happen
because
nobody
will
get
off
their
ass
and
make
it
happen
nuts
i
will
join
the
ranks
here
if
someone
has
the
ability
to
actually
put
this
thing
together
and
get
enough
support
ill
also
contribute
to
the
effort
and
jeeze
people
im
a
student
with
no
job
yet
and
i
will
put
up
my
own
hardearned
savings
if
it
means
we
have
a
shot
at
getting
the
truth
told
on
the
airwaves
