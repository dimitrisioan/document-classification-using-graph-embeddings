re
waco
shootout
highlights
total
irresponsibility
of
the
im
not
sure
were
this
thread
has
been
before
i
popped
in
but
ive
never
thought
of
waiting
periods
as
having
anything
to
do
with
training
or
competence
i
just
cant
imagin
any
valid
reason
for
having
a
gun
that
cant
wait
a
few
days
i
can
think
of
plenty
of
bad
reasons
for
not
wanting
a
waiting
period
i
want
to
buy
a
gun
and
kill
soandso
right
now
ive
crossed
the
state
line
to
buy
a
gun
illegally
and
i
cant
afford
to
spend
the
night
here
etc
im
not
a
big
fan
of
guns
but
i
feel
that
it
is
important
to
guard
americans
rights
to
own
them
on
the
other
hand
we
license
and
regulate
many
things
without
seriously
impeding
anyones
constitutional
rights
