THE
FOLLOWING
IS
QUOTED
FROM
THE
TAIL
END
OF
A
RATHER
CONDESCENDING
ARTICLE
ABOUT
PAXTON
QUIGLEY
THAT
APPEARED
IN
US
SNOOZE
AND
WORLD
LIES
SORRY
I
THINK
IT
WAS
IN
THE
WALL
STREET
JOURNAL
AND
WAS
REPEATED
IN
THE
COLORADO
PEOPLES
DAILY
A
STUDENT
NEWSPAPER
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
COLORADO
AT
BOULDER
A
STUDY
OF
RESIDENTIAL
GUNSOT
DEATHS
IN
KING
COUNTY
WASH
FOUND
THAT
A
GUN
IN
THE
HOME
WAS
TIMES
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
USED
TO
KILL
ITS
OWNER
SPOUSE
A
FRIEND
OR
CHILD
THAN
TO
KILL
AN
INTRUDER
THE
USED
TO
KILL
IS
THE
HEART
OF
THE
MISINFORMATION
ITS
ONE
OF
THOSE
TECHNICALLY
ACCURATE
PHRASINGS
THAT
CONVEYS
THE
WRONG
IMPRESSION
WHAT
MR
QUIQLEY
IS
MORE
THAN
AWARE
OF
IM
SURE
IS
THAT
WHEN
PEOPLE
READ
THIS
THEY
THINK
VIOLENT
ARGUMENTS
WHERE
ONE
MEMBER
OF
THE
FAMILY
GRABS
A
GUN
AND
SHOOTS
ANOTHER
THEREBY
CREATING
A
TRAGIC
SITUATION
WHICH
COULD
EASILY
HAVE
BEEN
AVOIDED
HAD
THE
GUN
NOT
BEEN
THERE
OR
A
TRAGIC
ACCIDENT
ESPECIALLY
INVOLVING
A
CHILD
UNFORTUNATELY
THATS
NOT
THE
WAY
THINGS
STACK
UP
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THAT
TIMES
I
BELIEVE
ARE
SUICIDES
THAT
IS
SOMEONE
INTENTIONALLY
TOOK
A
FIREARM
AND
SHOT
THEMSELVES
INTENDING
TO
KILL
THEMSELVES
AND
WHY
ITS
POPULAR
TO
TRY
AND
BLAME
SUICIDES
ON
GUNS
THE
EVIDENCE
DOESNT
SUPPORT
THIS
INTERNAL
STUDIES
AS
WELL
AS
COMPARATIVE
STUDIES
WITH
OTHER
COUNTRIES
INDICATE
THAT
CULTURAL
FACTORS
FAR
OUTWEIGH
WHETHER
A
PERSON
WILL
KILL
THEMSELVES
OR
NOT
JAPAN
FOR
INSTANCE
HAS
A
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
RATE
THAN
THE
US
THERE
PEOPLE
JUMP
OFF
BUILDINGS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NATIONAL
CRIME
SURVEY
OF
VIOLENT
CRIME
IS
COMMITED
BY
NONSTRANGERS
WHICH
MISTAKENLY
HAS
BEEN
GENERALIZED
REGARDING
THE
KING
COUNTY
STUDY
TO
MEAN
FRIENDS
AND
FAMILY
THAT
IS
MR
QUIGLEY
AND
OTHERS
WHO
QUOTE
THIS
STATISTIC
ARE
BANKING
ON
THE
MENTAL
IMAGE
THAT
A
FRIEND
FAMILY
MEMBER
OR
CHILD
EQUATES
TO
A
LOVING
RELATIONSHIP
AND
THAT
IT
WAS
CUT
SHORT
IN
A
MOMENT
OF
ANGER
UNFORTUNATELY
ALL
TOO
OFTEN
HUSBANDS
BEAT
AND
KILL
WIVES
CHILDREN
ASSAULT
PARENTS
OR
VICEVERSA
MOST
RAPES
ARE
COMMITED
BY
SOMEONE
KNOWN
TO
THE
VICTIM
FOR
INSTANCE
ESSENTIALLY
THAT
A
GUN
WAS
USED
AGAINST
A
FRIEND
OR
FAMILY
MEMBER
DOESNT
MEAN
THEY
WERENT
TRYING
TO
HURT
THE
OTHER
PERSON
CRIME
IS
HIGHEST
AMONG
POOR
URBAN
FAMILIES
AND
THOSE
ARE
ALSO
THE
AREAS
MOST
AT
RISK
FOR
FAMILY
PROBLEMS
ESPECIALLY
VIOLENT
ONES
A
SON
IN
A
GANG
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
LOVING
TOWARD
HIS
PARENTS
IF
THEY
DISAPPROVE
THAN
A
SUBURBAN
KID
MIGHT
FINALLY
IT
HINGES
ON
THE
FALLACY
THAT
A
DEAD
INTRUDER
IS
THE
ONLY
VALUE
OF
A
SELFDEFENSE
FIREARM
USING
THE
MINIMUM
FIGURES
I
WORKED
OUT
USING
THE
NCS
I
GOT
ABOUT
AN
RATIO
BETWEEN
DEADLY
SELFDEFENSES
JUSTIFIABLE
HOMICIDES
AND
WITHGUN
SELFDEFENSES
BETWEEN
THE
FBI
UNIFORM
CRIME
REPORT
AND
THE
NCS
THERES
AN
ENORMOUS
AMOUNT
OF
DATA
AND
ANYBODY
WITH
THE
CALCULATOR
CAN
CRUNCH
THE
NUMBERS
AS
SUCH
IT
IS
INCORRECT
TO
ASSUME
THAT
A
DEAD
BODY
IS
THE
ONLY
VALID
MEANS
OF
DETERMINING
THE
SUCCESS
OF
SUCH
A
DEFENSE
SINCE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NCS
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
CONSIDERED
BY
MANY
TO
SERIOUSLY
UNDERREPORT
DEFENSES
THERE
WERE
FAR
MORE
SUCCESSFUL
WITHGUN
DEFENSES
THAN
INTRUDERS
KILLED
NOT
IT
ALSO
CONFINES
ITSELF
TO
THE
HOME
WHERE
ATTACK
BY
A
FRIEND
OR
FAMILY
MEMBER
IS
FAR
FAR
MORE
LIKELY
AND
EXCLUDES
ANY
DEFENSE
WHICH
OCCURS
OUTSIDE
THE
HOME
I
BELIEVE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OCCUR
IN
BUSINESSES
STUDIES
BY
THE
WESTERN
PSYCHIATRIC
INSTITUTE
IN
PITTSBURGH
FOUND
THAT
THE
MERE
PRESENCE
OF
A
GUN
IN
THE
HOME
SHARPLY
INCRESASES
THE
LIKELIHOOD
A
FAMILY
MEMBER
WILL
COMMIT
SUICIDE
EVEN
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
PSYCHIATRIC
ILLNESS
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
THE
EXACT
DATA
FOR
THIS
SO
I
CANT
COMMENT
I
WILL
POINT
OUT
CANADAS
AND
JAPANS
SUICIDE
RATE
AS
INDICATIONS
THAT
CULTURE
FAR
MORE
THAN
FIREARM
AVAILABILITY
AFFECT
SUICIDE
RATES
THERE
WAS
ALSO
A
COMPARATIVE
STUDY
BETWEEN
CANADA
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
CONSIDERING
THE
DIFFICULTY
OF
COMPARING
ACROSS
CULTURAL
LINES
PUBLISHED
IN
THE
NEW
ENGLAND
JOURNAL
OF
MEDICINE
I
CAN
GET
THE
EXACT
CITE
IF
YOU
NEED
IT
THAT
CONCLUDED
THAT
RESTRICTIVE
FIREARM
LAWS
WOULD
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
IMPACT
THE
OVERALL
SUICIDE
RATE
