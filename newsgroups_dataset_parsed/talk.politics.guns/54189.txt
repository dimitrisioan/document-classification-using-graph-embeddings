WRITES
YOU
ARE
LOOSING
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
ABOUT
IT
OF
THOSE
WHO
VOTE
YOUR
CAUSE
IS
CONSIDERED
AN
ABOMINATION
NO
MATTER
HOW
HARD
YOU
TRY
PUBLIC
OPINION
IS
SET
AGAINST
THE
RKBA
NOT
SO
SURVEYS
HAVE
SHOWN
WHILE
THE
PUBLIC
THINKS
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
GUN
CONTROL
MAY
BE
ACCEPTABLE
THEY
DO
BELIEVE
THEY
HAVE
AN
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
AND
THAT
THE
POLICE
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
DISCRETION
OVER
WHO
MAY
AND
MAY
NOT
OWN
FIREARMS
THIS
IS
THE
END
BY
THE
FINISH
OF
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
YOUR
RKBA
WILL
BE
NULL
AND
VOID
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
A
LOT
OF
THINGS
WILL
BE
SCREWED
UP
HELL
WELL
PROBABLY
BE
JUST
LIKE
ENGLAND
TOUGH
TITTY
TOUGH
TITTY
MY
HOW
ELOQUENT
YOU
ARE
AS
FOR
YOUR
CLAIM
I
THINK
CLINTON
HAS
A
BIG
FIGHT
AHEAD
OF
HIM
IF
HE
THINKS
HES
GOING
TO
PASS
SOME
COMPREHENSIVE
GUN
LEGISLATION
HE
WILL
SIGN
THE
BRADY
BILL
IF
IT
GETS
TO
HIS
DESK
WE
WILL
DO
WHATEVER
WE
CAN
TO
EITHER
KEEP
THAT
FROM
HAPPENING
OR
MODIFY
IT
SUCH
THAT
IT
IS
ACCEPTABLE
TO
US
YOU
HAD
BETTER
DISCOVER
WAYS
TO
MAKE
DO
WITHOUT
FIREARMS
SORRY
THATS
NOT
POSSIBLE
AND
THATS
WHY
WE
WONT
GIVE
THEM
UP
EITHER
LEGALLY
OR
ILLEGALLY
AMERICANS
WILL
KEEP
THEIR
FIREARMS
THE
NUMBER
OF
UNREGISTERED
WEAPONS
IN
NEW
YORK
CITY
IS
IN
THE
MILLIONS
THERE
ARENT
EVEN
CLOSE
TO
THAT
NUMBER
OF
VIOLENT
CRIMINALS
THERE
THE
NUMBER
OF
CASES
OF
FIREARMS
ABUSES
HAS
RUINED
YOUR
CAUSE
IF
THE
GOVT
WAS
SERIOUS
ABOUT
STOPPING
VIOLENT
CRIME
THEY
WOULD
KEEP
VIOLENT
CRIMINALS
IN
JAIL
FOR
A
LONG
LONG
TIME
WHERE
THEY
BELONG
INSTEAD
OF
LETTING
THEM
OUT
ON
EARLY
RELEASE
THERE
IS
NOTHING
YOU
CAN
DO
ABOUT
IT
HEY
WE
CAN
GO
INTO
POLITICS
TOO
IF
WE
FEEL
LIKE
IT
THOSE
WHO
LIVE
BY
THE
SWORD
SHALL
DIE
BY
IT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THIS
ONE
BIT
THE
PRESS
IS
AGAINST
YOU
THE
PUBLIC
THE
VOTING
PUBLIC
IS
AGAINST
YOU
THE
FLOW
OF
HISTORY
IS
AGAINST
YOU
THIS
IS
IT
SNORE
LIKE
I
TAKE
ADVICE
ON
THE
RKBA
FROM
A
BRIT
NO
WAY
SURRENDER
YOUR
ARMS
SOON
ENOUGH
OFFICERS
WILL
BE
AROUND
TO
COLLECT
THEM
RESISTANCE
IS
USELESS
YOU
WATCH
TOO
MUCH
STAR
TREK
ACTUALLY
THIS
IS
AN
UNDERSTANDABLE
ATTITUDE
FROM
A
BRIT
YOU
ARE
A
SUBJECT
OF
THE
STATE
THEY
WILL
OVERWHELM
YOU
ONE
AT
A
TIME
NOT
NECESSARILY
THERE
ARE
WAYS
OF
RESISTING
OPPRESSION
WITHOUT
GETTING
CAUGHT
BY
THE
GOVT
YOUR
NEIGHBORS
WILL
NOT
HELP
YOU
THEY
WILL
CONSIDER
YOU
MORE
IF
AN
IMMEDIATE
THREAT
THAN
THE
ABSTRACT
CRIMINAL
THE
ABSTRACT
CRIMINAL
LIKE
THE
ONES
WHO
KILLED
A
RELATIVE
OF
MINE
WHILE
SHE
WAS
WORKING
IN
A
CARRYOUT
TOO
FUCKING
BAD
YOU
HAVE
GONE
THE
WAY
OF
THE
KKK
VIOLENT
SOLUTIONS
ARE
PASSE
WHILE
UNDESIRABLE
THEY
ARE
SOMETIMES
UNAVOIDABLE
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
RESIST
A
CRIMINAL
ATTACK
BY
ALL
MEANS
DO
NOTHING
I
WILL
A
TAKE
MY
CHANCES
RESISTING
VIOLENT
ATTACK
AND
B
STAND
A
BETTER
CHANCE
OF
BEING
UNHARMED
THAN
SOMEONE
WHO
DOES
NOTHING
AVOID
SITUATIONS
WHICH
ENCOURAGE
CRIMINALS
THEN
YOU
WILL
BE
AS
SAFE
AS
POSSIBLE
SUCH
AS
IT
IS
WHAT
A
JOKE
CRIMINALS
WANT
A
DISARMED
POPULATION
HOW
CAN
YOU
KEEP
CRIMINALS
FROM
PREYING
ON
US
AFTER
OUR
BEST
MEANS
OF
SELF
DEFENSE
IS
TAKEN
AWAY
