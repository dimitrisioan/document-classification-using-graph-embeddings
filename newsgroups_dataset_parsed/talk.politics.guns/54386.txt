RE
BATFFBI
REVENGE
IN
DONBNETCOMCOM
WRITES
ANYWAY
HERES
HOW
I
SEE
THE
WACO
AFFAIR
ID
BE
INTERESTED
IN
OTHER
PEOPLES
INTERPRETATIONS
KORESH
AND
HIS
PEOPLE
WERE
BASICALLY
MINDING
THEIR
OWN
BUSINESS
SOME
WEAPONS
VIOLATIONS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
COMMITTED
AND
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
DISAPPROVED
OF
PROSECUTING
HIM
FOR
THOSE
VIOLATIONS
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THE
BATF
WAS
CRIMINAL
FOR
STARTING
NEGOTIATIONS
WITH
A
MILITARY
STYLE
ASSAULT
AND
FOR
FIRING
INTO
A
HOUSE
WHERE
THERE
WERE
CHILDREN
AND
OTHER
NONCOMBATANTS
I
DONT
SEE
THEY
COULDNT
JUST
LEAVE
A
TOKEN
GUARD
ON
THE
PLACE
AND
WAIT
THE
BDS
OUT
I
DONT
APPROVE
OF
THE
TEAR
GAS
APPROACH
AND
IF
IT
CAUSED
THE
FIRE
TO
BE
STARTED
I
THINK
THE
FBI
AGENT
RESPONSIBLE
SHOULD
SPEND
YEARS
IN
JAIL
I
THINK
THE
LEGAL
TERM
WOULD
BE
NEGLIGENT
HOMICIDE
HOWEVER
IF
KORESHS
RESPONSE
TO
THE
TEAR
GAS
WAS
TO
KILL
EVERYONE
THERE
I
HOLD
HIM
LARGELY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
DEATHS
WELL
ITS
NICE
TO
SEE
SOMEONE
WITH
A
BRAIN
A
GENERAL
LACK
OF
PARANOIA
AND
A
WILLINGNESS
TO
PUT
HIS
THOUGHTS
IN
PUBLIC
I
TEND
TO
AGREE
WITH
ALL
YOU
HAVE
SAID
NEVER
ASSUME
FOUL
MOTIVES
WHEN
STUPIDITY
WILL
DO
JIMS
CORROLARY
TO
OCCAMS
RAZOR
SEMPER
FI
JAMMER
JIM
MILLER
TEXAS
AM
UNIVERSITY
AND
I
DONT
SPEAK
FOR
UH
WHICH
IS
TOO
BAD
BECAUSE
THEY
COULD
USE
THE
HELP
BECOME
ONE
WITH
THE
STUDENT
BILLING
SYSTEM
BE
THE
STUDENT
BILLING

POWER
FINDS
ITS
WAY
TO
THOSE
WHO
