RE
GUNS
IN
BACKCOUNTRY
NO
THANKS
IN
ARTICLE
PKGERAGHGSBPHDUCHICAGOEDU
KEVIN
GERAGHTY
WRITES
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
WHOLE
GUNSFORPROTECTION
MINDSET
IT
IGNORES
THE
SYSTEMIC
EFFECTS
OF
CUMULATIVE
INDIVIDUAL
ACTIONS
IF
YOU
WANT
FIRE
INSURANCE
ON
YOUR
HOUSE
THATS
PRUDENT
AND
IT
HAS
NO
EFFECT
ON
ME
BUT
IF
YOU
AND
A
BUNCH
OF
OTHER
PARANOIDS
ARE
PACKING
HANDGUNS
IN
THE
BACKCOUNTRY
IT
MAKES
ME
AND
ANYONE
ELSE
WHO
DOESNT
CHOSE
TO
PROTECT
HIMSELF
IN
THIS
MANNER
PRETTY
FKING
NERVOUS
WHY
IF
YOURE
NOT
A
THREAT
YOURE
NOT
AFFECTED
AT
ALL
I
MEAN
TAKE
THIS
TO
ITS
LOGICAL
CONCLUSION
SUPPOSE
WE
ALL
CARRIED
HANDGUNS
ALL
THE
TIME
FOR
PROTECTION
FROM
ALL
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
CARRYING
HANDGUNS
WOULD
WE
COLLECTIVELY
BE
OR
FEEL
SAFER
HELL
NO
WED
FEEL
A
LOT
MORE
INSECURE
WHY
I
NOTE
THAT
THE
AVAILABLE
PSYCH
INFO
SAYS
THAT
FEELINGS
OF
SECURITY
INCREASE
THE
VICTIMIZATION
STATS
SAY
THAT
THAT
INCREASE
IS
RATIONAL
ANOTHER
SYSTEMIC
EFFECT
OF
ALL
THE
GOOD
PEOPLE
PROTECTING
THEMSELVES
IS
THAT
THE
BAD
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
MODIFY
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
IN
RESPONSE
YES
THEY
ARE
BUT
HOW
THEYRE
GOING
TO
BE
MUCH
ITCHIER
AND
MUCH
MORE
WILLING
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
ROUTINE
MUGGINGS
IF
THEY
THINK
THEIR
NOPE
THAT
DOESNT
HAPPEN
INSTEAD
THE
SWITCH
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
CHANGE
BEHAVIORS
TO
PROPERTY
CRIMES
THATS
AN
IMPROVEMENT
EVEN
IF
THE
ECONOMIC
TAKE
IS
UNCHANGED
SURE
NOT
EVERYONE
SWITCHES
BUT
THEY
WERE
KILLING
BEFORE
ANDY
