is
there
something
similar
progun
people
can
do
for
example
pay
to
anyone
who
lawfully
protects
their
life
with
a
firearm
sounds
a
bit
tacky
but
hey
whatever
works
progun
people
can
take
used
potmetal
guns
with
sale
values
less
than
and
turn
them
in
thus
making
a
profit
at
the
gungrabbers
expense
seth
unlike
cats
dogs
never
scratch
you
when
you
wash
them
they
just
become
very
sad
and
try
to
figure
out
what
they
did
wrong
