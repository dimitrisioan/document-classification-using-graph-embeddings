look
folks
i
dont
know
what
happened
in
waco
i
do
not
claim
the
bds
are
angels
i
never
did
koresh
may
very
well
be
the
devil
incarnate
i
just
dont
know
but
i
do
know
that
i
must
question
any
single
source
of
information
such
as
we
have
here
and
i
must
question
even
harder
given
that
it
is
single
source
at
the
insistance
of
that
very
government
what
ever
else
happened
at
waco
that
is
perhaps
the
biggest
evil
done
and
even
more
so
in
light
of
the
discrepencies
turning
up
between
the
federal
officials
and
the
state
officials
but
what
i
really
dont
understand
is
the
hoards
of
devoted
government
worshipers
who
believe
the
government
could
not
possibly
do
any
wrong
they
are
fanatic
to
the
point
of
making
things
up
such
as
brents
microwave
oven
disclaim
of
the
bds
using
fire
for
food
heating
i
am
hard
pressed
to
see
any
real
difference
between
the
claimed
power
koresh
held
over
the
bds
and
the
demonstrated
power
the
government
holds
over
those
rapid
apologists
