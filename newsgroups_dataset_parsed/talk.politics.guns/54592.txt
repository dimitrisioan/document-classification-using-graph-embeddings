okay
james
tell
you
what
ill
but
you
in
a
building
with
other
people
ill
put
you
in
a
highly
tense
situation
ill
subject
you
to
sleep
deprivation
remove
your
utilities
march
tanks
back
in
forth
in
front
of
you
play
recordings
of
tortured
rabbits
at
high
volume
shine
bright
lights
in
your
windows
threaten
to
attack
you
at
any
time
and
cut
you
off
from
the
outside
world
all
for
weeks
at
a
time
then
ill
begin
to
smash
in
the
building
youre
in
destroying
passages
and
stairs
and
spreading
debris
everywhere
at
the
same
time
ill
pump
in
massive
quantities
of
nasty
tear
gas
for
six
hours
stop
it
enough
im
out
of
there
i
mean
im
a
relatively
sane
person
god
knows
im
weak
and
will
forgive
me
but
im
not
stupid
enough
to
stay
in
this
place
any
longer
i
want
out
youll
be
holed
up
in
a
small
area
with
sweaty
people
on
a
hot
day
then
the
building
will
fill
with
smoke
and
become
a
inferno
people
in
a
small
room
will
try
to
leave
with
you
and
jim
if
you
dont
make
it
out
wont
you
agree
that
it
must
be
because
you
wanted
to
die
besides
nine
people
did
successfully
flee
the
fire
yeah
and
at
least
one
person
ran
back
in
sounds
like
a
personal
choice
to
me
religious
fanaticsm
and
a
beleive
that
dying
in
the
defense
of
your
beliefs
is
probably
at
the
core
of
what
happened
in
waco
we
in
the
west
tend
to
disregard
fanaticsm
of
the
type
displayed
by
many
moslem
fundamentalist
groups
who
see
nothing
wrong
with
dying
for
their
beliefsconvictions
i
suspect
that
this
same
type
of
fanaticsm
was
displayed
by
the
bds
but
well
probably
never
