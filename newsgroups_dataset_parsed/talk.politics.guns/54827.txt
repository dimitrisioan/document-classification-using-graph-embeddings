MR

WROTE
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
WERE
NOT
VIOLENT
AND
WERE
NOT
PLANNING
TO
START
VIOLENCE
WHEN
THE
BD
COMPOUND
WAS
ASSAULTED
BY
THE
ATF
THE
BD
DID
FIRE
BACK
BUT
THEY
AGREED
TO
A
CEASE
FIRE
AND
THEY
ALLOWED
THE
ATF
TO
CARE
FOR
THEIR
WOUNDED
THE
BD
EVEN
RELEASED
THE
ATF
AGENTS
THEY
CAPTURED
IT
IS
CLEAR
FROM
THE
RELEASE
OF
THE
AGENTS
AND
ALLOWING
THE
ATF
MEDICAL
ATTENTION
THAT
THE
BD
WERE
NOT
LOOKING
FOR
TROUBLE
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
IVE
HEARD
OF
THE
BD
CAPTURING
AND
RELEASING
ATF
AGENTS
IS
THERE
ANY
MORE
INFO
ABOUT
THIS
ROB
P
IT
WAS
FILMED
THE
DAY
OF
THE
FIRST
ASSAULT
THE
BDS
CLEARLY
ALLOWED
THE
BATF
AGENTS
WHO
WERE
SHOT
AND
WOUNDED
TO
LEAVE
THE
COMPOUND
THE
LESSON
I
SUPPOSE
IS
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
KEEP
SHOOTING
UNTILL
ALL
THE
PIGS
ARE
DEAD
AND
THEN
GET
THE
FUCK
OUTA
DODGE
NEVER
GIVE
A
PIG
AN
EVEN
BREAK
SEEEEEE
YA
TURMOILHALCYONCOM
FUCK
THE
