writes
this
argument
sounds
very
stupid
if
the
ability
to
make
guns
from
simple
metalworking
was
easy
then
drug
dealers
would
make
their
own
wouldnt
they
they
do
according
the
the
los
angeles
police
department
illegal
manufacture
is
one
the
three
primary
sources
of
machine
guns
and
submachine
guns
used
in
crimes
sumggling
and
theft
from
the
police
and
military
being
the
other
two
washington
dc
police
have
stated
that
if
im
remembering
the
figure
correctly
of
the
guns
they
conficate
were
illegally
built
why
spend
hundreds
of
dollars
buying
a
gun
that
somebody
else
made
cheap
and
is
selling
it
to
you
at
an
exorbitant
markup
it
takes
about
hours
and
a
few
tools
to
make
one
at
least
one
of
reasonable
quality
unless
the
drug
dealer
enjoyes
messing
around
on
a
lathe
say
as
a
hobby
hes
going
to
have
to
pay
someone
anyway
materials
plus
six
hours
of
a
machinists
time
for
something
legal
would
run
about
the
blackmarket
prices
for
guns
are
usually
in
the
to
range
at
least
those
few
ive
seen
cited
in
newspaper
articles
were
the
simple
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
regardless
of
how
easy
it
is
to
make
guns
banning
guns
will
reduce
the
the
number
of
new
guns
and
seriuosly
impede
the
efforts
of
a
killer
intent
on
buying
a
weapon
washington
dc
has
a
total
ban
on
handguns
and
prohibits
assembled
rifles
within
city
limits
its
homicide
rate
is
almost
ten
times
the
national
average
it
is
also
illegal
for
a
dc
resident
to
drive
to
the
virginia
or
maryland
suburbs
and
buy
a
gun
dealers
are
required
by
federal
law
to
check
ids
and
make
sure
the
buyer
isnt
from
another
state
so
the
ban
can
not
be
easily
sidestepped
to
show
why
the
tools
argument
is
the
silliest
i
have
ever
seen
take
an
analogy
from
computer
science
almost
every
computer
science
major
can
write
a
wordprocessor
yet
wecomp
sci
majors
would
willingly
pay
to
bucks
for
a
professional
software
like
wordperfect
why
dont
we
just
all
write
our
own
software
because
it
is
highly
inconvinient
sure
but
it
you
couldnt
buy
one
you
would
write
your
own
in
fact
people
did
write
their
own
years
ago
more
likely
you
would
find
a
friend
who
was
a
particularly
good
programer
and
get
him
give
you
a
copy
of
his
software
is
a
very
bad
example
for
your
case
how
many
people
do
you
know
with
illegal
copies
of
word
processors
if
people
want
something
and
it
isnt
available
or
affordable
legally
they
will
usually
get
it
illegally
same
with
guns
quite
secondly
how
does
one
get
this
gunpowder
for
the
home
made
gun
the
formula
has
been
around
for
half
a
million
years
or
are
you
going
to
restrict
sales
of
sulpher
charcoal
and
saltpeter
thats
alot
cruder
than
modern
smokless
powder
but
it
works
very
well
the
only
real
problems
are
a
reduction
in
energy
so
a
magnum
would
only
be
as
deadly
as
a
and
it
makes
alot
more
smoke
of
course
a
smart
black
marketeer
could
just
make
the
gun
in
and
steal
the
ammunition
from
the
police
the
police
are
often
corruptable
and
things
are
known
to
disappear
from
police
evidence
rooms
and
armories
and
reappear
on
the
streets
if
guns
were
really
that
simple
to
make
the
bosnian
muslims
would
be
very
happy
people
or
is
it
the
case
that
metalworking
tools
are
banned
in
bosnia
deep
sarcasm
perhaps
you
werent
watching
the
news
two
years
ago
but
the
serbs
also
tried
to
invade
slovinia
they
were
driven
out
after
a
few
weeks
by
partisans
armed
with
homemade
antitank
weapons
the
afghan
rebels
frequently
made
their
own
rifles
