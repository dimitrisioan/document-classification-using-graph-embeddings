RE
BILL
BLAME
AMERICA
FIRST
CLINTON
STRIKES
AGAIN
ANHEUSER
BUSCH
WRITES
THIS
ARGUMENT
SOUNDS
VERY
STUPID
IF
THE
ABILITY
TO
MAKE
GUNS
FROM
SIMPLE
METALWORKING
WAS
EASY
THEN
DRUG
DEALERS
WOULD
MAKE
THEIR
OWN
WOULDNT
THEY
WHY
SPEND
HUNDREDS
OF
DOLLARS
BUYING
A
GUN
THAT
SOMEBODY
ELSE
MADE
CHEAP
AND
IS
SELLING
IT
TO
YOU
AT
AN
EXORBITANT
MARKUP
THE
SIMPLE
TRUTH
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
THAT
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
EASY
IT
IS
TO
MAKE
GUNS
BANNING
GUNS
WILL
REDUCE
THE
THE
NUMBER
OF
NEW
GUNS
AND
SERIUOSLY
IMPEDE
THE
EFFORTS
OF
A
KILLER
INTENT
ON
BUYING
A
WEAPON
TO
SHOW
WHY
THE
TOOLS
ARGUMENT
IS
THE
SILLIEST
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN
TAKE
AN
ANALOGY
FROM
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
ALMOST
EVERY
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
MAJOR
CAN
WRITE
A
WORDPROCESSOR
YET
WECOMP
SCI
MAJORS
WOULD
WILLINGLY
PAY
TO
BUCKS
FOR
A
PROFESSIONAL
SOFTWARE
LIKE
WORDPERFECT
WHY
DONT
WE
JUST
ALL
WRITE
OUR
OWN
SOFTWARE
BECAUSE
IT
IS
HIGHLY
INCONVINIENT
SAME
WITH
GUNS
SECONDLY
HOW
DOES
ONE
GET
THIS
GUNPOWDER
FOR
THE
HOME
MADE
GUN
TAKE
A
QUICK
TRIP
TO
THE
LOCAL
IF
GUNS
WERE
REALLY
THAT
SIMPLE
TO
MAKE
THE
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
WOULD
BE
VERY
HAPPY
PEOPLE
OR
IS
IT
THE
CASE
THAT
METALWORKING
TOOLS
ARE
BANNED
IN
BOSNIA
DEEP
SARCASM
WELL
THIS
IS
MY
TWO
CENTS
I
WILL
NOW
RESUME
READING
ALL
THESE
RIDICULUS
POST
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
MUST
MAKE
THEIR
LIVING
DOING
STANDUP
COMEDY
END
OF
FORWARDED
MATERIAL
AND
SO
THE
RUBBER
SPHEROID
ARCED
BENEATH
THE
BRILLIANT
LIGHTS
HEADED
FOR
A
HOOP
OF
DREAMS
HED
DREAMT
OF
ALL
THOSE
NIGHTS
THE
CROWD
GASPED
AS
THE
BALL
DESCENDED
WOULD
IT
GRANT
THEIR
FONDEST
WISH
THERE
WAS
NO
DOUBT
IN
CASEYS
MIND
HE
KNEW
IT
WAS
A
SWISH
