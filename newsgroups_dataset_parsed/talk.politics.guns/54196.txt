what
you
said
was
that
we
had
spent
money
on
guns
rather
than
people
as
canada
does
which
is
ridiculous
once
again
i
have
over
estimated
the
general
level
of
intellegence
of
the
average
reader
of
rushlimbaugh
canada
per
capita
spend
more
money
on
people
where
the
us
spend
more
money
per
capita
on
guns
what
exactly
do
you
mean
when
you
say
the
us
spends
more
per
capita
on
guns
than
canada
does
are
you
talking
about
the
us
government
or
are
you
talking
about
the
purchase
of
guns
by
private
citizens
or
both
if
you
are
referring
to
private
citizens
then
your
point
is
irrevelant
because
what
individuals
do
with
their
money
is
essentially
their
business
if
on
the
other
hand
you
meant
that
the
us
government
spends
more
per
capita
on
guns
than
canada
does
then
your
point
is
relevant
so
if
this
is
true
then
the
us
needs
to
get
its
priorities
straight
people
are
more
important
than
guns
that
is
not
to
say
that
guns
arent
important
im
just
saying
that
if
the
us
government
does
spend
more
per
capita
on
guns
than
they
do
on
people
then
something
is
awry
he
meant
the
us
spends
more
per
capita
on
guns
than
canada
which
isnt
really
surprising
because
we
were
so
busy
protecting
the
western
world
from
the
ussr
that
all
other
countries
could
slack
off
on
their
defense
spending
i
would
like
to
see
if
the
us
spends
more
per
capita
on
people
than
canada
does
this
is
a
true
apples
apples
comparison
where
the
previous
post
was
apples
oranges
