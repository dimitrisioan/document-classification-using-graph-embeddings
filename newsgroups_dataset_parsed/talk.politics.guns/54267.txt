RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE
THOMAS
PARSLI
THOMASPIFIUIONO
WRITES
OVERALL
CRIME
RATE
IT
FELLJUST
LIKE
THAT
TWO
QUESTIONS
WHEN
WAS
THIS
AND
DO
YOU
HAVE
THE
RELEVANT
NUMBERS
PLEASE
NOTE
THIS
IS
NOT
IN
ANY
WAY
AN
INDICATION
I
DONT
BELIEVE
YOU
OR
THAT
YOURE
NOT
CORRECT
BUT
WHEN
THE
DROP
OCCURED
IS
RELEVANT
ACQUIRING
WEAPONS
IN
NORWAY
YOU
CAN
BUY
ALMOST
ALL
KINDS
OF
WEAPONS
IN
NORWAY
BUT
YOU
MUST
HAVE
A
PERMIT
AND
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
GET
THE
PERMIT
IF
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HAVE
A
HANDGUN
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GET
AN
GUNLICENCE
FROM
THE
POLICE
AND
TO
BE
A
MEMBER
OF
A
GUNCLUB
THE
PRIMARY
OBJECTION
BEYOND
ONES
BASED
ON
THE
IDEAL
OF
RKBA
THAT
IT
IS
SIMPLY
NOT
SOMETHING
THE
GOVERNMENT
SHOULD
DO
IS
THAT
IT
MAKES
GUNS
A
PLAYTHING
AND
TOOL
OF
THE
RICH
AND
CONNECTED
IT
DISCRIMINATES
AGAINST
THE
POOR
IS
SELFDEFENSE
CONSIDERED
APPROPRIATE
AND
IF
SO
UNDER
WHAT
CONDITIONS
ARE
YOU
ALLOWED
FOR
INSTANCE
TO
GET
A
GUN
FOR
PROTECTION
IF
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
CARRYING
A
VERY
LARGE
SUM
OF
MONEY
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
OR
HAVE
BEEN
THREATENED
THE
POLICE
WOULD
CHECK
MY
CRIMINAL
RECORDS
FOR
ANY
SERIOUS
CRIMES
ANDOR
RECORDS
OF
SERIOUS
MENTAL
DISEASES
THIS
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
IN
THE
US
AND
GENERALLY
SUPPORTED
AMONG
GUN
OWNERS
WHAT
MANY
OBJECT
TO
IS
THAT
MANY
IF
NOT
MOST
PROPOSALS
CONTAIN
A
SORT
OF
GOTCHA
CLAUSE
WHICH
ALLOWS
AN
ARBITRARY
DENIAL
EVEN
IF
YOU
QUALIFY
IN
EVERY
WAY
NOW
IF
A
GOT
MY
LICENCE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
AN
ACTIVE
MEMBER
OF
THE
GUN
CLUB
FOR
MONTHS
BEFORE
I
COULD
COLLECT
MY
GUN
ITS
A
LITTLE
LIKE
GETTING
A
DRIVERS
LICENCE
ISNT
IT
YOU
HAVE
TO
PROVE
THAT
YOU
CAN
DRIVE
BEFORE
YOU
ARE
ALLOWED
TO
AT
THIS
POINT
IT
SHOULD
BE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
IN
GENERAL
A
DRIVERS
LICENCE
IN
THE
US
IS
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
NOTHING
LIKE
ITS
EUROPEAN
COUNTERPART
I
UNDERSTAND
GETTING
ONE
IS
FAR
MORE
DIFFICULT
THERE
THAN
HERE
IN
THE
US
ITS
A
JOKE
BUT
MY
USUAL
OBJECTION
IS
THAT
YOURE
DISCUSSING
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
FOR
INSTANCE
IN
THE
US
A
DRIVERS
LICENSE
IS
A
PERMIT
TO
OPERATE
A
MOTOR
VEHICLE
ON
A
PUBLIC
ROAD
IT
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
TO
OWN
ONE
OR
TO
OPERATE
IT
ON
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
THAT
IS
THE
ABILITY
TO
REQUIRE
DRIVING
PERMITS
IS
GENERALLY
CONSIDERED
TO
ARISE
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENTS
LEGITIMATE
POWER
TO
ENACT
REASONABLE
REGULATIONS
FOR
BEHAVIOR
ON
PUBLIC
LANDS
A
PERMIT
TO
OWN
AN
AUTOMOBILE
FOR
INSTANCE
WHICH
IS
FAR
CLOSER
AN
ANALOGY
WOULD
BE
A
MUCH
HARDER
THING
TO
GET
PAST
LEGALLY
SINCE
IT
WOULDNT
BE
BASED
ON
MAKING
REGULATIONS
ON
PUBLIC
PROPERTY
BUT
IN
RESTRICTING
ACTIVITY
ON
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
USE
OF
GUNS
IN
CRIMES
IN
NORWAY
SOME
CRIMES
ARE
COMMITED
WITH
GUNS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
IN
THE
OWNERS
ARMS
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BUT
THESE
ARE
RATHER
THE
EXEPTION
MOST
CRIMINALS
ACCUIRE
GUNS
TO
USE
THEM
IN
CRIMES
AND
MOSTLY
SHORT
TIME
BEFOR
THE
CRIME
USE
OF
KNIVES
IT
IS
ALLOWED
TO
CARY
KNIFES
IN
PUBLIC
BUT
NOT
IN
YOUR
BELT
OR
OPEN
YOU
AMERICANS
THINK
ITS
OK
TO
HAVE
A
GUN
BUT
NOT
TO
CARRY
IT
OPEN
IN
PUBLIC
RIGTH
THIS
VARIES
WIDELY
ONE
THING
I
THINK
EUROPEANS
HAVE
A
DIFFICULT
TIME
WITH
IS
THAT
THE
US
HAS
FIFTY
UNIQUE
JURISDICTIONS
WHERE
THE
LAWS
FROM
ONE
STATE
TO
ANOTHER
CAN
BE
AS
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
AS
FROM
ONE
COUNTRY
IN
EUROPE
TO
ANOTHER
SOME
PLACES
ALLOW
OPEN
CARRY
OF
BOTH
GUNS
AND
KNIVES
SOME
ALLOW
CONCEALED
SOME
PROHIBIT
BOTH
OR
ALLOW
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
AND
IT
CAN
BE
EITHER
A
STATE
OR
LOCAL
RESTRICITON
INDIVIDUAL
VS
MASSES
YES
THE
INDIVIDUAL
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
THE
MASSES
BUT
ONLY
TO
SOME
EXTENT
YOUR
CRIMINAL
LAWS
ARE
TO
PROTECT
THE
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
MAKES
THE
MASSES
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
THE
RIGTHS
OF
SOME
INDIVIDUALS
AFFECTS
THE
RIGHTS
OF
ALL
THE
OTHERS
THE
QUESTION
MUST
BE
ASKED
IS
THE
RIGHT
OF
THIS
INDIVIDUAL
AFFECTING
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THIS
OTHER
INDIVIDUAL
WHAT
WE
USUALLY
GET
IS
THAT
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THIS
GROUP
MEANING
SOME
INDIVIDUALS
WITHIN
THIS
GROUP
HERE
DEFINED
AS
PEOPLE
WHO
OWN
GUNS
ARE
ADVERSELY
AFFECTING
THE
RIGHTS
OF
SOME
OTHER
GROUP
IF
FOR
INSTANCE
BOB
WERE
USING
HIS
GUN
TO
ATTACK
STEVE
YOUD
HAVE
A
POINT
BUT
ESSENTIALLY
WHAT
WERE
DISCUSSING
IS
THAT
BECUASE
SOME
PERSON
WHO
QUALIFIES
AS
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
GROUP
PEOPLE
WHO
OWN
GUNS
THEN
SOME
THIRD
PERSON
PERHAPS
IN
ANOTHER
TIME
ZONE
IS
TOLD
THAT
THEIR
BEING
A
MEMBER
OF
THAT
GROUP
IS
TAKING
AWAY
SOMEBODY
ELSES
RIGHTS
ITS
LIKE
TRYING
TO
PUNISH
ALL
NEWSPAPERS
FOR
THE
LIBEL
COMMITED
BY
ONE
THE
ISSUE
I
BELIEVE
THE
ISSUE
IS
GUNS
AND
GUNLEGISLATION
THE
ISSUE
IS
CRIME
VIOLENCE
AND
MURDER
THE
QUESTION
IS
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
GUNS
AND
GUN
LEGISLATION
IMPACT
THOSE
WE
SHOULDNT
MIX
WEAPONS
AND
ITEMS
THAT
CAN
SERVE
AS
ONE
IF
I
LIVED
IN
AMERIKA
I
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
A
GUN
TO
DEFEND
MYSELFE
IN
HOME
BUT
SHOULD
IT
HAVE
TO
BE
LIKE
THAT
OF
COURSE
NOT
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
WE
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
FEAR
THAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
MIGHT
GET
IT
INTO
THEIR
TWISTED
LITTLE
MINDS
TO
HURT
US
BUT
CURRENTLY
WE
DONT
HAVE
THAT
OPTION
NOR
DO
I
EXPECT
WE
WILL
DO
YOU
THINK
ITS
WISE
TO
SELL
GUNS
LIKE
CANDY
SOME
STATES
DO
NO
STATE
DOES
IN
ANY
CASE
THERES
A
LIMIT
TO
WHICH
THE
STATE
MAY
ENFORCE
ITS
WISDOM
ON
ME
FREEDOM
IN
GENERAL
IS
AN
UNWISE
CONCEPT
IF
YOU
PREEMPTIVELY
RESTRICT
EVERYTHING
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
UNWISE
THEN
FREEDOM
BECOMES
A
MEANINGLESS
CONCEPT
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
ITS
SMARTNECCACERY
TO
HAVE
DRIVERSLICENCE
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
IT
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
BUY
GUNS
ILL
RAISE
MY
HAND
AGAINST
DRIVERS
LICENSES
AS
CURRENTLY
IMPLEMENTED
THEYRE
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
AND
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
REVANUE
GENERATION
FOR
THE
STATE
AND
IGNORED
BY
A
STARTLING
NUMBER
OF
DRIVERS
IT
DOES
NOT
GUARANTEE
A
LEVEL
OF
SKILL
ANY
HIGHER
THAN
IS
NECESSARY
TO
GET
YOUR
CAR
ON
THE
ROAD
AND
GET
YOURSELF
OR
SOMEBODY
ELSE
KILLED
OR
A
KNOWLEDGE
OF
TRAFFIC
LAWS
BEYOND
WHAT
ANY
TEN
YEAR
OLD
WILL
HAVE
PICKED
UP
RIDING
AROUND
IN
HIS
PARENTS
CAR
BUT
AS
I
MENTIONED
THEYRE
TWO
DIFFERENT
