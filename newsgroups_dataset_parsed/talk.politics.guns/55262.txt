WRITES
THEY
ASSEMBLED
A
FRIGHTENING
ARSENAL
OF
WEAPONS
WHAT
EXACTLY
DID
YOU
FIND
FRIGHTENING
ABOUT
THEIR
WEAPONS
THE
LETHALITY
IN
SMALL
PART
BUT
MOSTLY
WHAT
I
FOUND
FRIGHTENING
WAS
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
WERE
WIELDED
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
BELIEVED
THAT
THEY
ATE
BREAKFAST
EVERY
MORNING
WITH
JESUS
CHRIST
NOW
I
WASNT
THERE
IN
GALILEE
BACK
IN
THE
ROMAN
OCCUPATION
SO
I
DONT
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
NOT
JESUS
CHRIST
BUT
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
THAT
HE
WAS
NOT
EVEN
ASIDE
FROM
THE
FACT
OF
NEVER
HAVING
SEEN
THEM
IN
A
PHOTOGRAPH
TOGETHER
BY
CIRCUMVENTING
LAWS
WHICH
WERE
INTENDED
TO
PREVENT
SUCH
A
BUILDUP
WHICH
LAWS
ARE
YOU
MAKING
REFERENCE
TO
I
ADMIT
I
CANT
CITE
A
SPECIFIC
BUT
IF
THERE
ISNT
A
LAW
AGAINST
PURCHASING
GRENADE
COMPONENTS
AND
ASSEMBLING
THEM
INTO
FUNCTIONING
UNITS
THEN
PERHAPS
WE
NEED
ONE
ALL
SECOND
AMMENDMENT
ARGUMENTS
ASIDE
IM
JUST
NOT
SURE
THAT
I
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
PRIVATE
CITIZENS
WITH
HAND
GRENADES
