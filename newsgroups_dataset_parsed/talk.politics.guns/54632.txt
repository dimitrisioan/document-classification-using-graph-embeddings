THE

WHAT

THIS
WHAT

THE

NEITHER
THE

WHERE

LETS
TAKE
A

LOOK
AT
THIS
RISKY
BUSINESS
THE
TIMES
STAT
OF
THE

STUDY
IS
THE
PRODUCT
OF
DIVIDING
THE
NUMBER
OF

JUSTIFIABLY
KILLED
IN
SELFDEFENSE
THE
DIVISOR
INTO
THE
NUMBER
OF
FAMILY
MEMBERS
OR
ACQUAINTANCES
KILLED
BY
A

IN
THE

THE
DIVIDEND
THE
DIVISOR
OF
THIS
RISK
EQUATION
IS
IN
THE

FIVEYEAR
SAMPLE
THERE
WERE
INTRUDERS
AND
OTHER
CASES
OF

THE
DIVIDEND
IS
IN
THE

THERE
WERE
ACCIDENTAL

CRIMINAL
HOMICIDES
AND

THERE
WERE
A

THE

UNACCOUNTED
THE

MISLEADING
ON

OF
THE

WHO

AND

MEMBERS
IS

THE
IMPLICATION
IS
THAT
THE
OFFENDING

TARGET
AND
KILL
ONLY
BELOVED
FAMILY
MEMBERS
DEAR
FRIENDS
AND
INNOCENT
CHILDREN
DEATHS
MAY
ALL
BE
EQUALLY
TRAGIC
BUT
THE
CHARACTER
AND
CIRCUMSTANCE
OF
BOTH
VICTIMS
AND
KILLERS
ARE
RELEVANT
TO
THE
RISK
THESE
CRUCIAL
RISK
FACTORS
ARE
MASKED
BY
THE
CALCULATED
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
DEATH
TOLL
IS
GENERATED
BY
WITLESS
WALTONS

DEAR

AND

THIS
IS
CRIMINOLOGICAL
HOGWASH

DOES
NOT
DISTINGUISH

OR

THE

WHO

IN

BY

NEITHER

BUT
THE

THE

ONE
MISLEADING
IMPLICATION
OF
THE
WAY
THE

IS
THAT
THE
MERE

OF

IN

IS
MUCH
MORE

AND
THIS

THAT

THE

BY

GUN

THE

BEGGED
IS
HOW

ANYWAY
WITHOUT

IN

SUICIDE

A

PROBLEM
OF

VERY
DIFFERENT

THE
IMPLICATION
OF
THE

IS
THAT
THESE

IT
IS
TRUE
THAT

IT
