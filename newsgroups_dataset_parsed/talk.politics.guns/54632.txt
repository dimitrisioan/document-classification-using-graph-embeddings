evenhanded
article
on

armed

wsj
cites
the
worlds
most
notorious
statistic
regarding
guns
in
the
home
a
pioneering
study
of
residential
gunshot
deaths
in
king
county
washington
found
that
a
gun
in
the
home
was
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
kill
its
owner
spouse
a
friend
or
child
than
to
kill
an
intruder
the
times
stat
is
everywhere
these
days
it
has
grown
in
media
lore
like
the
proverbial
urban
myth
it
was
inflated
by
one
pugilistic
talkshow
pundit
to
given
the
shock
value
of
the
finding
the
conclusion
of
the
new
england
journal
of
medicine
nejm
study
is
remarkably
understated
the
advisability
of
keeping
firearms
in
the
home
for
protection
must
be
questioned
responsible
people
should
indeed
question
the
risks
and
benefits
of
bringing
a
firearm
into
their
home
but
what
we
need
to
know
is
this
what
exactly
are
the
risks
and
benefits
the
nejm
testimony
is
neither
the
whole
truth
about
the
benefits
nor
nothing
but
the
truth
about
the
risks
further
as
with
motor
vehicles
we
want
to
know
what
control
do
we
have
over
the
risks
and
benefits
and
as
with
the
risks
of
cancer
or
heart
disease
or
auto
accidents
how
can
we
minimize
the
risks
like
raw
highway
death
tolls
the
nejm
stat
is
not
very
helpful
here
the
nejm
finding
purports
to
inform
us
but
it
is
framed
to
warn
us
off
it
is
widely
promulgated
in
the
media
as
a
scare
stat
a
misleading
halftruth
whose
very
formulation
is
calculated
to
prejudice
and
terrify
the
frightful
statistic
screams
for
itself
the
risks
far
outweigh
the
benefits
yes
what
fool
would
run
these
risks
if
your
car
were
times
more
likely
to
kill
you
a
loved
one
a
dear
friend
or
an
innocent
child
than
to
get
you
to
your
destination
should
you
not
take
the
bus
uncritical
citation
puts
the
good
name
of
statistics
in
the
bad
company
of
lies
and
damned
lies
surely
we
can
do
better
where
lives
are
at
stake
lets
take
a
closer
look
at
this
risky
business
the
times
stat
of
the
nejm
study
is
the
product
of
dividing
the
number
of
home
intrudersaggressors
justifiably
killed
in
selfdefense
the
divisor
into
the
number
of
family
members
or
acquaintances
killed
by
a
gun
in
the
home
the
dividend
the
divisor
of
this
risk
equation
is
in
the
studys
fiveyear
sample
there
were
intruders
and
other
cases
of
selfdefense
the
dividend
is
in
the
study
there
were
accidental
deaths
criminal
homicides
and
suicides
divided
by
yields
there
were
a
total
of
gunrelated
deaths
in
king
county
between
and
so
the
study
leaves
deaths
outside
of
homes
unaccounted
the
nejms
notorious
times
statistic
is
seriously
misleading
on
six
counts
the
dividend
is
misleadingly
characterized
in
the
media
the
or
acquaintances
of
the
study
who
include
your
friendly
drug
dealers
and
neighborhood
gang
members
is
equated
to
friends
the
implication
is
that
the
offending
guns
target
and
kill
only
beloved
family
members
dear
friends
and
innocent
children
deaths
may
all
be
equally
tragic
but
the
character
and
circumstance
of
both
victims
and
killers
are
relevant
to
the
risk
these
crucial
risk
factors
are
masked
by
the
calculated
impression
that
the
death
toll
is
generated
by
witless
waltons
shooting
dear
friends
and
friendly
neighbors
this
is
criminological
hogwash
the
study
itself
does
not
distinguish
households
or
environs
populated
by
people
with
violent
criminal
or
substanceabuse
histories
where
the
risk
of
death
is
very
high
versus
households
inhabited
by
more
civil
folk
for
example
people
who
avoid
highrisk
activities
like
drug
dealing
gang
banging
and
wife
beating
where
the
risk
is
very
low
indeed
in
actuality
negligent
adults
allow
fatal
but
avoidable
accidents
and
homicides
are
perpetrated
mostly
by
people
with
histories
of
violence
or
abuse
people
who
are
identifiably
and
certifiably
at
high
risk
for
misadventure
to
ignore
these
obvious
risk
factors
in
firearm
accidents
and
homicides
is
as
misleading
as
ignoring
the
role
of
alcohol
in
vehicular
deaths
by
tautology
neither
gun
deaths
nor
vehicular
deaths
would
occur
without
firearms
or
vehicles
but
the
person
and
circumstance
of
the
gun
owner
or
driver
crucially
affect
the
risk
one
misleading
implication
of
the
way
the
nejm
stat
is
framed
is
that
the
mere
presence
of
a
gun
in
the
home
is
much
more
likely
to
kill
than
to
protect
and
this
obscures
indeed
disregards
the
role
of
personal
responsibility
the
typical
quotation
of
this
study
unlike
larsons
attributes
fatal
agency
to
the
gun
a
gun
in
the
home
is
times
as
likely
to
kill
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
a
major
promulgator
of
the
nejm
statistic
uses
this
particular
formulation
we
can
dispense
with
the
silly
debate
about
whether
its
people
or
guns
that
accomplish
the
killing
again
by
tautology
gun
deaths
would
not
occur
without
the
guns
the
question
begged
is
how
many
deaths
would
occur
anyway
without
the
guns
in
any
case
people
are
the
deathdealing
agents
the
guns
are
their
lethal
instruments
the
moral
core
of
the
personal
risk
factors
in
gun
deaths
are
personal
responsibility
and
choice
due
care
and
responsibility
obviate
gun
accidents
human
choice
mediates
homicide
and
suicide
by
gun
or
otherwise
the
choice
to
own
a
gun
need
not
condemn
a
person
to
nejms
highrisk
pool
the
gun
does
not
create
this
risk
by
itself
people
have
a
lot
to
say
about
what
risk
they
run
with
guns
in
their
homes
for
example
graduates
of
paxton
quigleys
personal
protection
course
do
not
run
the
touted
times
risk
any
more
than
skilled
and
sober
drivers
run
the
same
risks
of
causing
or
suffering
vehicular
death
as
do
reckless
or
drunk
drivers
undiscriminating
actuarials
disregard
and
obscure
the
role
of
personal
responsibility
and
choice
just
as
they
disregard
and
obscure
the
role
of
socioeconomic
criminological
and
other
riskrelevant
factors
in
firearmrelated
death
this
is
why
we
resent
insurance
premiums
and
actuarial
consigment
to
risk
pools
whose
norms
disregard
our
individualities
fortunately
nothing
can
consign
us
to
the
nejm
risk
pool
but
our
own
lack
of
choice
or
responsibility
in
the
matter
suicide
accounts
for
of
the
deaths
by
gun
in
the
home
in
the
nejm
study
as
against
the
total
deaths
by
gun
in
king
county
including
those
outside
the
home
inhouse
suicides
are
of
the
total
death
toll
which
is
closer
to
the
roughly
proportion
found
by
other
studies
suicide
is
a
social
problem
of
a
very
different
order
from
homicide
or
accidents
the
implication
of
the
nejm
study
is
that
these
suicides
might
not
occur
without
readily
available
guns
it
is
true
that
attempted
suicide
by
gun
is
likely
to
succeed
it
is
not
obviously
true
that
the
absence
of
a
gun
would
prevent
any
or
all
of
these
suicides
this
is
widely
assumed
or
alleged
but
the
preponderance
of
research
on
guns
and
suicide
actually
shows
otherwise
that
this
is
wishful
thinking
in
all
but
a
few
truly
impulsive
cases

if
suicides
were
removed
from
the
dividend
of
the
nejm
studys
risk
equation
the
times

would
deflate
to

the
inclusion
of
suicides
in
the
nejm
risk
equation
like
the
causes
durability
or
interdiction
of
suicidal
intent
itself
is
a
profoundly
debatable
matter
quotations
of
the
nejm
study
totally
disregard
this
issue
citations
of
the
nejm
study
also
mislead
regarding
the
estimable
rate
of
justifiable
and
excusable
homicide
most
measures
like
the
nejm
homicide
rate
are
based
on
the
immediate
disposition
of
cases
but
many
homicides
initially
ruled
criminal
are
appealed
and
later
ruled
selfdefense
in
the
literature
on
battered
women
immediate
case
dispositions
are
notorious
for
underrepresenting
the
rate
of
justifiable
or
excusable
homicide

july
cover
story
on
a
week
of
gun
deaths
reported
of
the
domestic
cases
as
shootings
by

victims
but
only
of
the
homicides
were
reported
as
selfdefense
in
a
may
update
time
reported
that
of
the
homicides
had
eventually
been
ruled
selfdefense
in
times
sample
the
originally
reported
rate
of
selfdefense
was
in
error
by
a
factor
of
four
the
possibility
of
such
error
is
not
acknowledged
by
promulgators
of
the
nejm
statistic
while
both
the
dividend
and
the
product
of
the
nejm
risk
equation
are
arguably
inflated
the
divisor
is
unconscionably
misleading
the
divisor
of
this
equation
counts
only
aggressors
who
are
killed
not
aggressors
who
are
successfully
thwarted
without
being
killed
or
even
shot
at
the
utility
of
armed
selfdefense
is
the
other
side
of
the
coin
from
the
harms
done
with
guns
in
homes
what
kind
of
moral
idiocy
is
it
to
measure
this
utility
only
in
terms
of
killings
do
we
measure
the
utility
of
our
police
solely
in
terms
of
felons
killed
as
opposed
to
the
many
many
more
who
are
otherwise
foiled
apprehended
or
deterred
should
we
not
celebrate
let
alone
count
those
cases
where
no
human
life
is
lost
as
successful
armed
defenses
the
question
posed
to
media
that
cite
the
nejm
scare
stat
is
this
why
neglect
the
compendious
research
on
successful
armed
defense
notably
by
criminologist
gary
kleck
point
blank
guns
and
violence
in
america
aldine
de
gruyter
klecks
estimations
of
the
rate
and
risk
of
defensive
firearm
use
are
based
on
victimization
surveys
as
well
as
other
studies
the
rate
is
high
about
one
million
a
year
and
the
risk
is
good
gun
defenders
fare
better
than
anyone
either
those
who
resort
to
other
forms
of
resistance
or
those
who
do
not
resist
dividing
one
million
gun
defenses
a
year
by
annual
gun
deaths
from
selfdefense
homicides
suicides
and
accidents
yields
thus
we
can
construct
a
much
more
favorable
statistic
than
the
nejm
scare
stat
a
gun
is
times
more
likely
to
be
used
to
defend
against
assault
or
other
crime
than
to
kill
anybody
of
course
klecks
critics
belittle
the
dividend
of
this
calculation
what
is
good
news
for
gun
defenders
is
bad
news
for
gun
control
we
should
indeed
question
the
basis
and
method
of
klecks
high
estimation
of
defensive
firearm
use
as
i
have
questioned
the
nejm
statistic
clearly
the
issue
of
how
to
manage
mortal
risks
is
not
settled
by
uncritical
citation
of
statistics
one
thing
troubles
me
still
we
can
hardly
escape
the
unquestioned
nejm
scare
stat
in
our
media
but
we
hardly
ever
find
klecks
good
work
mentioned
even
critically
