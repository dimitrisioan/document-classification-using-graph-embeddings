perhaps
we
are
a
little
off
track
the
discussion
was
about
rewording
the
amendment
this
specifically
refers
to
the
right
to
bear
arms
bear
and
arms
are
key
words
here
no
is
it
too
simplistic
to
say
that
if
you
cant
pick
it
up
ie
bear
it
or
if
it
is
not
a
firearm
then
it
can
be
restricted
without
amending
the
constitution
firearm
lets
not
even
consider
long
knives
swords
which
were
also
common
militia
weapons
in
the
century
and
which
if
anything
are
often
restricted
more
heavily
than
firearms
whatever
sense
gun
control
makes
knife
control
makes
even
less
