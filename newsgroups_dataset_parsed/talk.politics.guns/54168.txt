FOX
AM
APR
THIS
ISNT
RECGUNS
SO
MAYBE
THIS
IS
GETTING
A
BET
TECHNICAL
BUT
I
CANT
RESIST
A
REVOLVER
ALSO
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
THAT
IF
IT
MISFIRES
YOU
JUST
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
AGAIN
SOMETIMES
DEPENDS
ON
WHY
IT
MISFIRED
A
DOUBLEACTION
REVOLVER
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THEM
CAN
BE
HANDCOCKED
FIRST
BUT
WILL
FIRE
MERELY
BY
PULLING
THE
TRIGGER
I
CANT
IMAGINE
DOING
MUCH
COMBAT
TYPE
SHOOTING
SINGLE
ACTION
A
MISFIRE
IN
A
REVOLVER
MERELY
MEANS
YOU
MUST
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
AGAIN
TO
ROTATE
TO
THE
NEXT
ROUND
ASSUMING
THE
CYLINDER
WILL
ROTATE
A
REVOLVER
CAN
BE
CARRIED
WITH
THE
CHAMBER
EMPTY
AND
UNDER
THE
HAMMER
FOR
MAXIMUM
SAFETY
BUT
STILL
CAN
BE
DRAWN
AND
FIRED
WITH
AN
EASY
MOTION
EVEN
ONE
HANDED
NEVER
HURTS
TO
ERR
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
SAFETY
BUT
IF
YOUVE
GOT
ONE
OF
THOSE
NEW
FANGLED
HAMMER
BLOCKS
OR
TRANSFER
BAR
SAFETIES
ITS
UNNECESSARILY
REDUNDANT
ID
RATHER
HAVE
THE
EXTRA
ROUND
SPEEDLOADERS
FOR
A
REVOLVER
ALLOW
RELOADS
ALMOST
AS
FAST
AS
MAGAZINES
ON
SEMIAUTOS
CAN
BE
FASTER
DEPENDING
ON
USERS
QUITE
TRUE
SPEED
LOADERS
ARE
A
LITTLE
LESS
CONVENIENT
TO
PACK
AROUND
THAN
MAGAZINES
THOUGH
A
MISFIRE
IN
A
SEMIAUTO
WILL
REQUIRE
YOU
TO
CLEAR
A
JAMMED
SHELL
FIRST
TIME
SPENT
WHICH
CAN
BE
FATAL
AND
A
VITAL
SECOND
OR
SO
IS
OFTEN
LOST
AS
YOU
REALIZE
HEY
ITS
JAMMED
BEFORE
STARTING
TO
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
CLEARING
IT
TRUE
BUT
THIS
IS
A
TRAINING
FUNCTION
MOST
SEMIAUTOS
MUST
HAVE
THE
SLIDE
WORKED
TO
CHAMBER
THE
FIRST
ROUND
AND
COCK
THE
HAMMER
SOME
POLICE
CARRY
THEIR
SEMIAUTOS
WITH
THE
CHAMBER
LOADED
AND
HAMMER
COCKED
BUT
A
SAFETY
ENGAGED
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THIS
SAFE
HOWEVER
YOU
MUST
TRADEOFF
SAFETY
TO
GET
THE
SAME
SPEED
OF
EMPLOYMENT
AS
A
REVOLVER
COCKED
AND
LOCKED
FOR
SINGLE
ACTIONS
OR
HAMMER
DOWN
ON
DOUBLE
ACTIONS
ARE
THE
ONLY
CARRY
MODES
THAT
MAKE
SENSE
THE
SERIES
COLTS
FOR
EXAMPLE
ARE
QUITE
SAFE
TO
CARRY
THIS
WAY
THERE
ARE
SOME
DOUBLEACTION
SEMIAUTOS
OUT
THERE
BUT
THE
COMPLEXITY
OF
OPERATION
OF
MANY
OF
THEM
REQUIRES
MORE
TRAINING
AGREED
NOW
THAT
IVE
SHOT
OFF
MY
MOUTH
A
BIT
LET
ME
BACK
SOME
OF
THIS
UP
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
A
SIMPLE
MISFIRE
ON
A
REVOLVER
DOESNT
COST
YOU
MUCH
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IVE
HAD
ALL
SORTS
OF
INTERESTING
THINGS
HAPPEN
OVER
THE
YEARS
FOR
EXAMPLE
IVE
HAD
FACTORY
AMMUNITION
THAT
HAS
HAD
HIGH
PRIMERS
A
HIGH
PRIMER
WILL
TIE
YOUR
REVOLVER
UP
SOMEWHERE
FROM
SECONDS
TO
MINUTES
WHILE
YOU
TRY
TO
POUND
THE
ACTION
OPEN
TO
CLEAR
THE
PROBLEM
AN
AUTO
JACK
THE
SLIDE
AND
CONTINUE
IVE
HAD
BULLETS
COME
OUT
OF
THE
CASE
KEEPING
THE
CYLINDER
FROM
TURNING
SEE
CLEARING
PARAGRAPH
ABOVE
ABOUT
THE
WORST
THAT
CAN
HAPPEN
WITH
A
SEMI
AUTO
IS
A
DOUBLE
FEED
THIS
CAN
BE
CLEARED
IN
SECONDS
MOST
REVOLVERS
ARE
MORE
FRAGILE
THEN
SEMI
AUTOS
THERE
ARE
ALL
SORTS
OF
CLOSE
TOLERANCE
PARTS
AND
FITTING
INVOLVED
DROPPING
THE
GUN
OR
A
BLOW
TO
THE
GUN
OR
ALL
SORTS
OF
THINGS
CAN
TAKE
IT
OUT
OF
ACTION
MANY
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
THAT
CAN
BE
CURED
ON
THE
SPOT
WITH
A
QUALITY
SEMI
AUTO
TAKE
A
GUN
SMITH
FOR
A
REVOLVER
IN
SHORT
A
REVOLVER
MAY
BE
LESS
LIKELY
TO
MALFUNCTION
BUT
AS
A
RULE
WHEN
IT
DOES
YOURE
OUT
OF
THE
FIGHT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
MALFUNCTIONS
THAT
OCCUR
WITH
SEMI
AUTOS
DOES
NOT
FALL
INTO
THAT
CATEGORY
VINCINT
MAKES
MANY
GOOD
POINTS
IN
THIS
POST
BUT
LEAVES
OFF
THE
OPPOSING
VIEW
OF
MOST
OF
THEM
A
REAL
GOOD
STARTING
PLACE
IS
AYOOBS
THE
SEMI
AUTO
PISTOL
FOR
POLICE
AND
SELF
DEFENSE
IN
GENERAL
ID
AGREE
THE
REVOLVER
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
FIRST
GUN
AND
SELF
DEFENSE
WEAPON
FOR
SOMEBODY
THAT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
TIME
AND
INCLINATION
THAT
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
TRAINING
AND
PRACTICE
NEEDED
TO
USE
A
SEMI
AUTO
EFFECTIVELY
AS
A
SELF
DEFENSE
ARM
MOST
COPS
ARE
NOTORIOUSLY
INDIFFERENT
TO
FIREARMS
IF
THE
DEPARTMENT
ISNT
GOING
TO
TRAIN
THEM
THEY
ARENT
GOING
TO
TAKE
THE
TIME
ON
THEIR
OWN
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
TRAINING
IS
AN
ISSUE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
TRAINING
REQUIRED
FOR
EFFECTIVE
USE
OF
A
SEMI
AUTO
IS
PROBABLY
SEVERAL
TIMES
THAT
OF
A
REVOLVER
MANY
COPS
DONT
BOTHER
FOR
MYSELF
ID
HATE
TO
BE
LIMITED
TO
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
ID
RATHER
PICK
WHAT
FITS
BETTER
WITH
MY
PERSONAL
INCLINATION
WHAT
IM
WEARING
THAT
DAY
AND
SO
ON
LIKE
THE
MODERATOR
ON
RECGUNS
SAYS
BUY
EM
ALL
THAT
SAID
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
THAT
OFTEN
MY
ADVICE
TO
PEOPLE
THINKING
OF
BUYING
THEIR
FIRST
DEFENSE
ARM
IS
RIGHT
AFTER
TAKING
A
CLASS
GET
A
RUGER
OR
SMITH
REVOLVER
SORRY
COLT
FANS
COLT
REVOLVERS
ARE
OK
TOO
IF
THIS
POST
HAD
GONE
THE
OTHER
WAY
ID
BE
ARGUING
FOR
REVOLVERS
