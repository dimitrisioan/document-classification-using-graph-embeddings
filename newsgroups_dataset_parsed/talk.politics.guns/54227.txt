do
you
know
how
many
deaths
each
year
are
caused
by
selfinflicted
gun
shot
wounds
by
people
wearing
thigh
holsters
no
but
i
have
several
other
breakdowns
of
accidental
shootings
ive
never
seen
one
that
specifically
provides
the
info
that
davis
insists
that
he
has
so
id
love
to
have
a
cite
if
you
fall
for
example
and
land
on
the
handgun
or
cause
a
sudden
blow
the
gun
will
discharge
wrong
theres
one
gun
design
where
that
can
happen
and
it
is
supposed
to
be
carried
with
the
hammer
over
an
unloaded
chamber
cocking
the
gun
turns
the
cylinder
so
that
a
loaded
cylinder
is
under
the
hammer
in
other
words
it
can
be
usefully
carried
in
a
safe
manner
other
handgun
designs
dont
have
that
property
if
their
trigger
isnt
pulled
the
hammer
cant
hit
the
firing
pin
the
number
of
people
killed
in
this
manner
far
outweighs
the
number
of
deaths
caused
by
animal
attacks
or
wacko
attacks
combined
the
breakdowns
that
i
do
have
include
the
above
category
from
them
i
can
safely
say
that
if
davis
is
right
in
all
of
his
claims
a
large
negative
number
of
people
are
killed
by
animals
because
we
know
that
the
number
of
killings
by
wackos
is
reasonably
large
and
that
the
number
of
accidents
due
to
gun
failures
which
is
a
superset
of
the
described
circumstance
is
near
zero
i
can
find
the
figures
if
you
dont
believe
me
please
do
include
a
cite
for
those
of
us
who
like
looking
at
context
make
sure
that
your
source
excludes
other
types
of
accidents
and
suicides
that
are
misreported
