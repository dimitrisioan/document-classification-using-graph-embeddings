RMJUST
A
SHORT
THOUGHT
WHEN
YOU
ASK
THE
QUESTION
OF
THE
AUTHORITIES
OR
SPONSORS
OF
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WHETHER
THEY
WILL
CHECK
FOR
STOLEN
WEAPONS
AND
THEY
ANSWER
NO
ITS
TOTAL
AMNESTY
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
THE
GIVEN
FOR
EACH
FIREARM
IN
THE
BOSTON
BUY
BACK
WILL
NOT
BE
IN
CASH
BUT
MONEY
ORDERS
HOW
MUCH
TOTAL
AMNESTY
CAN
YOU
GET
IF
YOU
LEAVE
PAPER
TRAIL
BEHIND
IN
THE
LATEST
CASE
IN
DENVER
THEY
WERE
GIVING
AWAY
TICKETS
TO
A
DENVER
NUGGETS
BASKETBALL
GAME
HOW
TRACEABLE
IS
A
MONEY
ORDER
I
DONT
KNOW
HAVENT
USED
ONE
IN
YEARS
MONEY
ORDERS
OPERATE
PRETTY
MUCH
LIKE
CHECKS
WITH
BOTH
PARTIES
BEING
SUPPOSED
TO
SIGN
THEM
I
ASSUME
YOUD
HAVE
TO
SHOW
THE
BUYBACK
PEOPLE
AN
ID
AND
YOUD
THEN
HAVE
A
MONEY
ORDER
MADE
OUT
TO
THAT
ID
AS
FAR
AS
TRACEABLE
AS
A
PRACTICAL
MATTER
I
DONT
KNOW
IT
WOULD
DEPEND
ON
WHETHER
THEY
BOTHER
TO
COMPUTERIZE
WHO
THE
RECIPIENTS
NAME
IS
ON
THE
MONEY
ORDER
AND
BOTHER
KEYING
THAT
SORT
OF
THING
IN
ID
SAY
CERTAINLY
THE
POLICE
AND
THE
BUYBACK
PEOPLE
WOULD
KEEP
A
RECORD
OF
WHO
THEY
GAVE
MONEY
ORDERS
OUT
TO
IS
THAT
EVEN
AN
ISSUE
IF
THE
WEAPONS
ARENT
CHECKED
FOR
BEING
STOLEN
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
QUESTIONS
ASKED
I
SUPPOSE
IF
SOMEBODY
BROUGHT
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
WEAPONS
EACH
TIME
OVER
A
SERIES
OF
BUY
