the
issue
has
never
been
whether
tanks
were
used
in
detroit
in
it
has
been
whether
they
fired
their
main
guns
never
this
is
incorrect
either
you
dont
read
very
well
or
resort
to
falsehoods
in
an
attempt
to
make
a
point
at
the
risk
of
boring
and
belaboring
the
point
my
claim
was
the
chain
was
regarding
the
tanks
last
used
in
detroit
in
the
text
follows
you
did
not
merely
claim
that
tanks
were
usedyou
claimed
that
they
fired
their
main
guns
to
suppress
sniper
fire
and
that
they
were
quite
effective
at
this
indeed
when
coffman
claimed
they
were
only
used
as
apcs
i
did
say
i
had
been
told
they
did
fire
their
main
guns
you
continue
to
back
away
from
this
claim
and
defend
something
else
that
nobody
is
disputing
well
the
poster
who
i
responded
to
did
dispute
the
use
of
tanks
rude
of
you
to
call
gary
coffman
a
nobody
well
its
not
the
main
gun
gee
thats
only
the
entire
point
are
you
now
going
to
admit
that
you
were
wrong
that
was
the
entire
point
to
you
what
exactly
did
i
claim
ive
heard
eyewitness
descriptions
of
tanks
using
their
main
guns
to
respond
to
sniper
fire
quite
effectively
i
wasnt
wrong
ive
heard
those
descriptions
if
youre
paying
attention
ive
mentioned
that
i
saw
the
tanks
with
my
own
eyes
but
the
main
gun
firing
was
an
account
i
heard
that
helps
people
judge
whether
or
not
to
kick
in
the
to
use
your
words
bullshit
filters
stating
that
i
claimed
this
is
a
falsehood
what
was
it
i
claimed
as
fact
heres
the
entire
post
we
havent
used
tanks
against
the
black
ghettos
since
detroit
correction
i
know
they
used
tanks
in
detroit
i
saw
em
it
was
well
covered
in
the
news
at
that
time
gordon
lightfoot
mentions
it
in
his
song
black
day
in
july
since
you
dont
dispute
that
and
claim
that
nobody
else
does
that
means
i
was
right
i
will
never
read
of
tanks
firing
their
main
guns
in
detroit
in
the
riots
there
is
simply
no
way
that
such
an
event
could
have
taken
place
without
it
being
common
knowledge
even
years
later
the
american
military
firing
shells
from
tanks
in
american
cities
on
blacks
would
have
been
big
news
so
one
would
suppose
some
folks
think
in
happened
in
awesley
goes
on
you
can
also
read
of
the
troops
using
grenade
launchers
to
fire
fragmentary
grenades
i
doubt
that
as
well
to
fire
concussion
grenades
perhaps
to
fire
tear
gas
certainly
but
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
let
us
believe
they
fired
frags
wouldnt
you
since
it
makes
your
other
claim
seem
more
plausible
john
again
strawman
techniques
do
you
feel
youre
losing
it
so
you
have
to
stretch
what
i
said
and
knock
that
down
what
i
read
said
nothing
about
what
they
fired
and
so
i
put
nothing
in
there
if
you
need
some
help
let
me
know
and
il
take
your
side
of
this
for
a
while
youre
not
scoring
here
youre
boring
here
if
tanks
had
fired
their
main
guns
in
detroit
people
would
have
been
screaming
about
it
for
the
past
two
and
half
decades
i
would
know
about
it
glad
to
know
youre
such
an
expert
nice
to
hear
some
an
authority
i
especially
appreciate
your
basis
of
knowledge
if
it
had
happened
you
would
have
know
it
since
you
are
such
an
authority
you
probably
know
that
people
did
scream
about
an
alleged
massive
coverup
in
the
number
of
people
killed
in
the
detroit
riot
some
claimed
dead
others
said
the
offical
number
is
but
the
concise
columbia
encyclopedia
says
it
was
several
ive
also
heard
some
things
about
that
but
i
wont
dare
repeat
them
youd
assert
that
i
claimed
they
were
truth
unless
you
also
claim
that
the
national
guard
managed
to
cover
it
up
taking
the
tour
after
the
riots
it
was
pretty
easy
to
tell
the
difference
between
army
and
guard
troops
or
so
i
recall
from
years
ago
and
i
seem
to
recall
it
was
the
army
running
the
tanks
so
it
would
have
been
an
army
coverup
another
part
of
my
memories
was
that
while
most
damaged
building
were
burnt
some
were
in
rubble
based
on
what
i
remember
i
was
and
am
inclined
to
believe
an
old
sarge
or
two
if
your
mind
is
open
enough
to
believe
that
well
good
for
you
i
prefer
to
live
in
reality
and
here
in
reality
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
those
tanks
even
had
any
shells
much
less
fired
them
given
the
level
in
destruction
in
detroit
im
quite
willing
to
believe
that
they
did
fire
their
guns
now
then
weve
bored
the
shit
out
of
anyone
whose
bothered
to
read
this
far
and
all
youve
managed
to
say
is
that
you
dont
believe
the
account

cited
