RE
WACO
BURNING
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
PERHAPS
YOU
CONSIDER
THAT
HITLER
WAS
NOT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
HOLOCAUST
SINCE
THE
ALLIES
COULD
HAVE
DONE
MORE
TO
STOP
HIM
ATTENTION
PLEASE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
RULES
OF
USENET
FLAME
WARS
ONCE
A
DISCUSSION
DEGENERATES
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
HITLER
IS
MENTIONED
THAT
FLAME
WAR
MAY
BE
DECLARED
ENDED
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TAKE
THIS
OPPORTUNITY
TO
DO
THAT
NOW
CLEARLY
FURTHER
DISCUSSION
IS
NOT
USEFUL
WITH
THE
CURRENT
SET
OF
FACTS
AND
THE
CURRENT
NAME
CALLING
AND
INVOCATION
OF
HITLERS
NAME
IS
NOT
PRODUCTIVE
EVEN
BY
THE
STANDARDS
OF
USENET
TALK
GROUPS
IF
YOU
MUST
CONTINUE
PLEASE
DONT
DISCUSS
THIS
IN
MISCLEGAL
ITS
NOT
ABOUT
THE
LAW
IF
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DISCUSS
THE
LAW
AS
IT
APPLIES
TO
THE
WACO
INCIDENT
PLEASE
ASK
QUESTIONS
OF
THE
FORM
IF
THE
FBI
STARTED
THE
FIRE
ACCIDENTALLY
WHO
WOULD
BE
LEGALLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
DEATHS
NOTE
THAT
FOLLOWUPS
ARE
SET
NOT
TO
INCLUDE
