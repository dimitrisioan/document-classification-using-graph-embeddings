according
to
kikk
radio
in
houston
all
nine
survivors
are
either
in
hos
pitals
or
in
jails
including
the
two
who
allegedly
helped
start
the
fires
in
the
fbi
briefing
no
mention
was
made
of
having
the
fire
starters
in
custody
which
one
the
one
yesterday
or
has
there
been
another
if
it
was
yester
day
catch
up
imo
of
all
conspiracy
charges
are
easily
explained
by
the
simple
fact
that
in
these
days
of
instantaneous
news
transmission
all
kinds
of
stuff
gets
said
when
people
really
just
dont
know
what
the
hells
going
on
then
the
story
changes
once
the
facts
are
in
and
suddenly
cries
of
its
all
a
whitewash
start
naturally
everybody
wants
to
cover
hisher
ass
why
the
total
isolation
well
it
wasnt
total
isolation
after
the
lawyer
snuck
in
the
first
time
they
the
fbi
etc
let
him
go
back
inside
several
times
in
cluding
i
think
the
day
before
the
final
assualt
why
not
his
mother
why
not
the
media
damnfino
i
just
tend
to
take
issue
with
absolute
statements
that
are
ob
viously
wrong
on
their
face
and
tend
to
inflame
not
inform
the
isolation
was
significant
but
not
total
