re
nature
of
the
waco
gas
in
a
previous
article

dave
bernard
says
just
heard
on
the
network
radio
news
a
spokesman
from
the
army
saying
that
the
type
of
cs
gas
used
in
waco
had
been
banned
from
military
use
its
use
is
also
banned
by
a
draft
international
agreement
on
the
use
of
chemical
weapons
in
warfare
the
reason
given
was
that
the
use
causes
extreme
nausea
blindness
disorientation
total
irrationality
raging
paranoia
i
dont
know
about
the
paranoia
and
irrationality
but
the
rest
is
pretty
close
all
though
you
left
out
the
inability
to
breath
of
course
you
can
make
a
claim
that
people
will
do
some
fairly
deranged
things
to
get
away
from
it
ive
seen
teenagers
flatten
drill
sergeants
to
get
out
of
tents
full
of
it
which
raises
another
issue
children
would
be
all
the
more
susceptible
and
show
the
results
all
the
earlier
this
is
the
stuff
janet
reno
was
told
would
be
safe
for
children
what
they
didnt
mention
is
that
in
the
open
it
probably
wouldnt
do
too
much
harm
to
children
although
i
wouldnt
use
it
in
close
proximity
to
infants
on
the
other
hand
in
confined
spaces
the
effects
are
greatly
intensified
to
the
point
of
lethality
since
a
sufficient
quantity
of
cs
will
displace
oxygen
when
running
a
cs
chamber
careful
attention
is
paid
to
ventilation
i
wonder
if
they
checked
to
see
if
any
of
the
bds
were
asthmatics
or
suffered
from
other
respiratory
diseases
i
doubt
it
if
you
were
smarter
youd
have
these
opinions
