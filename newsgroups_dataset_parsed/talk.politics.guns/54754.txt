have
a
look
inside
his
place
as
they
intended
to
do
orchestrated
character
assassination
noise
torture
and
a
holocaust
would
never
have
come
to
pass
do
you
know
what
a
noknock
search
with
grenades
is
once
again
koresh
closed
the
door
on
an
agent
with
a
search
warrant
and
the
door
was
then
perforated
by
a
rain
of
bullets
from
the
inside
they
shot
first
the
koresh
cult
standoff
is
over
may
his
victims
recquiescat
in
pace
