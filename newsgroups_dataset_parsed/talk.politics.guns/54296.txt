RE
GUNS
IN
BACKCOUNTRY
NO
THANKS
HMM
WOULDNT
MANDITORY
SAFTEY
CLASSES
REGISTRATION
OF
BOTH
THE
OWNER
AND
GUN
AND
MANDITORY
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
BE
NICE
FOR
GUN
OWNERS
THE
TWO
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
I
POINTED
OUT
ABOVE
THERE
ARE
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
MAKING
RULES
FOR
USE
ON
PUBLIC
PROPERTY
AND
MAKING
RULES
FOR
OWNERSHIP
THE
OTHER
HALF
OF
THE
OBJECTION
IS
TRUST
SIMILAR
THINGS
TO
THIS
HAVE
BEEN
TRIED
IN
MANY
LOCAL
JURISDICATIONS
ACROSS
THE
COUNTRY
AND
HAVE
BEEN
ABUSED
IN
FAR
TOO
MANY
CASES
SAFETY
CLASSES
WHICH
ARE
NEVER
SHEDULED
NEVER
FUNDED
OR
ONLY
ONE
OR
TWO
IS
HELD
A
YEAR
FOR
A
LIMITED
NUMBER
OF
PARTICIPANTS
REGISTRATION
LISTS
IN
NEW
YORK
CHICAGO
AND
CALIFORNIA
HAVE
BEEN
USED
FOR
CONFISCATION
MANY
GUN
OWNERS
WOULD
IN
THEORY
SUPPORT
THESE
PLANES
ALTHOUGH
THE
NUMBERS
OVERWHELMINGLY
SHOW
THAT
COMPETENCE
IS
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
INTENTIONAL
MISUSE
IS
THEYVE
SIMPLY
SEEN
IT
ABUSED
AND
ARE
LEERY
OF
THE
NEXT
PERSON
WHO
COMES
DOWN
THE
PIKE
WITH
A
REASONABLE
SUGGESTION
THEYVE
ALREADY
SEEN
ABUSED
GUN
SAFETY
CLASSES
SOUND
GOOD
IN
THEORY
BUT
THEY
KIND
OF
REMIND
ME
OF
THE
LITERACY
TESTS
USED
IN
THE
BAD
OLD
DAYS
TO
KEEP
BLACKS
FROM
VOTING
THEY
CAME
WITH
THE
GRANDFATHER
CLAUSE
IF
YOUR
GRANDFATHER
COULD
VOTE
YOU
COULD
VOTE
SORT
OF
LIKE
THE
GUN
SAFETY
LAWS
THAT
ONLY
LET
THE
POLITICAL
ASSKISSERS
HAVE
GUNS
