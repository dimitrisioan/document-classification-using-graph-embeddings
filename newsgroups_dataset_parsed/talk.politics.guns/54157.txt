D
TAVARES
WRITES
CONSIDER
A
SIMILAR
STRUCTURE
A
WELLEDUCATED
ELECTORATE
BEING
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
FREE
STATE
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
TO
KEEP
AND
READ
BOOKS
SHALL
NOT
BE
INFRINGED
NOW
DOES
THIS
MEAN
ONLY
THE
ELECTORATE
CAN
KEEP
AND
READ
BOOKS
DOES
IT
MEAN
ONLY
REGISTERED
VOTERS
CAN
KEEP
AND
READ
BOOKS
DOES
IT
MEAN
ONLY
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
VOTED
CAN
KEEP
AND
READ
BOOKS
DOES
IT
IMPLY
ANY
RESTRICTIONS
AT
ALL
ON
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
READ
BOOKS
BUT
IT
WOULD
IMPLY
THAT
THE
STATE
HAD
THE
RIGHT
TO
REGULATE
AND
ENFORCE
EDUCATION
THATS
NICE
BUT
IT
DOESNT
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
FEDS
CAN
MANDATE
LITERACY
AND
THE
FEDS
CANT
INTERFERE
WITH
LITERACYBOOK
POSSESSION
AS
FAR
AS
JOHN
Q
PUBLIC
WITH
A
GUN
THE
SUPREME
COURT
HAS
ALREADY
RULED
IN
CASES
SUCH
AS
US
V
MILLER
US
AND
US
V
VERDUGOURQUIDEZ
S
CT
THAT
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
AMENDMENT
PROTECTS
THIS
INTERPRETATION
CAN
BE
FOUND
AS
FAR
BACK
AS
THE
DRED
SCOTT
CASE
IN
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
US
VS
MILLER
SUSTAINED
MILLERS
CONVICTION
OF
POSSESSION
OF
AN
ILLEGAL
FIREARM
NOTING
THAT
A
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUN
WAS
NOT
A
PROPER
MILITIA
WEAPON
THEREFORE
US
VS
MILLER
SUPPORTS
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
OF
FIREARMS
ACTUALLY
THE
MILLER
COURT
DID
NOTHING
OF
THE
KIND
IT
REMANDED
THE
CASE
BACK
TO
THE
TRIAL
COURT
BECAUSE
THE
MILLER
COURT
DIDNT
KNOW
IF
THE
WEAPON
IN
QUESTION
WAS
A
MILITIA
WEAPON
DOESNT
IT
BOTHER
ANYONE
THAT
A
MAJOR
CONSTITUTIONAL
ISSUE
WAS
TAKEN
UP
IN
A
CASE
WHERE
THERE
WAS
NO
DEFENSE
MILLER
HAD
BEEN
RELEASED
BY
THE
APPEALS
COURT
AND
DISAPPEARED
ONLY
THE
GOVT
WAS
REPRESENTED
WE
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
WITH
THE
REASONABLE
ALL
GUNS
ARE
MILITIA
WEAPONS
ARGUMENT
