correction
the
fbi
says
that
two
of
the
nine
who
escaped
said
the
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
cult
members
since
the
press
was
kept
miles
away
we
have
absolutely
no
independent
verification
of
any
of
the
governments
claims
in
this
matter
indeed
larry
king
had
the
two
attorneys
whose
clients
are
now
dead
of
koresh
and
another
davidian
on
his
show
last
night
their
discussions
with
the
survivors
differ
from
the
fbi
account
the
attorneys
say
that
they
were
told
that
the
tanks
knocked
over
lanterns
in
the
compound
which
started
the
fires
government
spokespeople
have
lied
and
contradicted
each
other
throughout
this
whole
affair
ill
wait
for
some
better
evidence
before
i
form
an
opinion
