writes
actually
the
words
a
well
regulated
milita
being
necessary
to
the
security
of
a
free
state
is
a
present
participle
used
as
an
adjective
to
modify
militia
which
is
followed
by
the
main
clause
of
the
sentence
the
subject
being
the
right
the
verb
shall
it
asserts
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
essential
for
maintaining
a
milita
a
free
state
yes
i
agree
the
first
half
of
the
amendment
does
modify
the
noun
militia
but
the
difinition
of
modify
that
applies
to
how
well
regulated
modifies
militia
is
to
qualify
or
limit
the
meaning
of
for
example
wet
modifes
day
in
the
phrase
a
wet
day
the
amendment
is
similiar
to
the
statement
a
wet
day
being
annoying
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
wear
boots
shall
not
be
infringed
so
how
does
a
dry
day
pertain
the
right
to
use
boots
similiar
what
does
the
unorganized
militia
have
to
due
with
the
right
to
own
guns
the
sentence
in
the
second
amendment
doesnt
restrict
the
right
or
state
or
imply
possession
of
the
right
by
anyone
or
anything
other

make
a
positive
statement
regarding
a
right
of
the
people
the
people
as
in
you
and
me
as
in
the
first
fourth
ninth
tenth
as
well
as
the
second
amendment
the
existence
of
this
right
is
assumed
it
is
not
granted
by
the
amendment
there
is
no
stated
or
implied
condition
relating
the
right
to
bear
arms
to
the
necessity
of
a
wellregulated
militia
to
the
security
of
in
other
words
the
entire
sentence
says
that
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
arms
is
unconditional
no
not
unconditional
but
shall
not
be
infringed
infringed
is
defined
as
to
break
or
ignore
the
terms
of
or
obligations
an
oath
an
agreement
law
or
the
like
to
disreguard

this
definition
implies
the
following
of

form
of
existing
agreement
laws
and
agreements
are
made
in
advance
boundaries
or
limits
of
behavior
are
set
by
society
as
a
whole
the
word
unconditional
implies
no
agreements
or
all
previous
agreements
are
off
which
is
the
opposite
the
words
used
in
the
first
amendment
are
much
stronger
ie
congress
shall
make
no
law
are
much
stronger
they
clearly
imply
unconditional
if
the
writers
of
the
amendment
wanted
unconditional
whay
didnt
they
says
congress
shall
make
no
laws
pertaining
the
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
arms
the
second
amendment
implies
a
sort
contract
between
the
people
the
people
and
the
state
the
bigger
part
of
the
contract
is
the
people
have
the
right
to
overthrew
the
government
and
its
laws
at
any
time
to
guarantee
this
right
the
laws
cannot

the
people
from
forming
a
well

most
