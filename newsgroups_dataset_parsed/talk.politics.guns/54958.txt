what
i
would
like
to
see
is
some
serious
discussion
of
this
incident
i
believe
the
moves
made
were
right
and
proper
but
i
still
have
some
problems
with
some
of
the
tactics
after
watching
the
abc
special
on
it
tonight
as
well
as
cnn
and
nightline
i
question
some
of
the
atf
and
fbi
actions
my
god
a
sane
person
somebody
asking
intelligent
questions
rather
than
spouting
of
unsubstantiated
drivel
and
making
comparisons
to
nazi
germany
i
question
along
with
others
the
initial
raid
by
the
atf
there
are
some
definite
questions
needing
answers
could
it
have
been
possible
to
have
taken
koresh
outside
the
compound
at
some
time
before
the
feb
raid
probably
which
is
why
there
are
so
many
people
angry
at
the
initial
confrontation
why
attack
a
compound
with
as
many
people
in
that
compound
who
are
willing
to
die
for
their
leader
further
they
attacked
in
the
daylight
hours
without
proper
backup
medical
support
etc
that
was
rather
stupid
could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
this
i
doubt
while
i
question
the
atfs
initial
raid
i
believe
that
the
remainder
of
the
standoff
was
handled
fairly
well
with
the
single
exception
of
the
psychological
warfare
by
blaring
music
etc
i
think
that
was
uncalled
for
and
probably
hindered
the
outcome
were
fbi
actions
blaring
loudspeakers
etc
the
right
course
of
action
see
above
and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
agreed
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
which
is
actually
rather
refreshing
nowadays
most
of
the
time
the
higherups
claim
i
dont
remember
or
i
had
no
involvement
