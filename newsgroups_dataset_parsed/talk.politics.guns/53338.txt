re
gun
control
proud
to
be
a
canuck
does
anyone
really
believe
the
swiss
have
had
no
war
within
their
borders
because
every
adult
male
owns
a
rifle
im
a
great
admirer
of
the
swiss
but
years
of
peace
on
their
turf
has
zilch
to
do
with
gun
ownership
can
you
picture
hitler
with
panzers
and
fockewulfs
poised
on
the
border
losing
sleep
over
a
few
thousand
expert
rifleman
sure
hitler
stayed
out
of
switzerland
because
the
swiss
run
the
money
in
this
world
wed
do
well
to
emulate
them
on
that
and
forget
about
getting
more
rifles
on
the
street
lets
disband
the
nra
and
start
a
national
investment
banking
association
replete
with
red
and
black
sticker
for
the
back
window
of
bubbas
mercedes
we
could
fire
charlton
heston
and
get
paul
volcker
for
a
spokesman
