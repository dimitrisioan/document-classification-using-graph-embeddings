where
did
you
hear
about
the
thermal
imaging
i
havent
heard
this
yet
not
that
i
doubt
it
im
just
looking
for
sources
this
was
reported
in
canadian
papers
thursday
april
i
think
the
source
was
upi
but
dont
recall
for
certain
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
did
have
this
kind
of
info
they
could
broadcast
it
and
it
would
resolve
or
at
least
help
to
resolve
alot
of
doubt
in
peoples
minds
personally
the
way
the
fbibatfrenoetc
is
claiming
all
sorts
of
things
without
offering
one
shred
of
proof
other
than
their
good
word
is
very
suspicious
to
me
a
picture
is
worth
a
thousand
words
i
understand
that
at
least
two
goverment
investigations
have
been
ordered
so
we
may
learn
more
during
their
hearings
i
sincerely
hope
you
are
right
and
it
turns
out
with
indisputable
proof
broadcast
across
our
land
that
the
government
groups
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fire
but
until
i
see
such
proof
i
think
it
is
just
as
likely
that
a
tank
did
knock
over
a
lantern
as
koresh
torching
the
place
the
only
evidence
i
have
seen
is
a
tank
crashing
through
the
front
wall
withdrawing
and
seconds
later
flames
are
seen
the
first
flames
on
the
video
erupting
from
this
very
same
spot
coincidence
perhaps
tough
call
without
more
investigation
but
if
the
thermal
imaging
story
holds
up
i
think
the
government
will
be
more
credable
of
course
paranoia
fans
wont
believe
their
results
anyway
will
they
if
such
proof
exists
the
government
should
publish
it
and
put
all
this
speculation
to
rest
hear
hear
id
also
like
to
see
the
autopsy
reports
confirm
news
reports
that
multiple
victims
were
found
shot
in
the
head
and
in
positions
inconsistent
with
fire
victims
it
is
simply
too
early
to
draw
conclusions
either
way
about
this
nasty
incident
but
i
tend
to
believe
the
government
side
the
old
frogs
almanac
a
salute
to
that
