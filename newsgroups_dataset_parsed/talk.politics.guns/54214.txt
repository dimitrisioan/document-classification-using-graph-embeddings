RE
AMENDMENT
DEAD
GOOD
OH
CHRIST
HERE
WE
GO
AGAIN
IM
ACTUALLY
GOING
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
SERIOUS
POSTING
FOOL
THAT
I
AM
IN
ARTICLE
JRMGNVIFASUFLEDU
WRITES
YEA
THERE
ARE
MILLIONS
OF
CASES
WHERE
YOY
SAY
THAT
FIREARMS
DETER
CRIMINALS
ALAS
THIS
IS
NOT
PROVABLE
I
THINK
THAT
THAT
THERE
ARE
ACTUALLY
FEW
CASES
WHERE
THIS
IS
SO
AND
I
SUPPOSE
I
SHOULD
JUST
TAKE
YOUR
WORD
FOR
IT
DID
YOU
EVER
THINK
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
USE
FIREARMS
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES
MIGHT
NOT
ADMIT
TO
IT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
RIDICULOUS
LAWS
WHICH
EXIST
FORBIDDING
CONCEALED
CARRY
THE
BULK
OF
FIRAREMS
ARE
USED
AGAINST
UNWORTHY
AND
UNNESESSARY
OPPONENTS
THOSE
WHO
POSESSA
A
COOL
JAKCET
YOU
WANT
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
ARGUE
WITH
YOU
ABOUT
A
PARKING
SPACE
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
TAKE
YOUR
WOMAN
IN
SHORT
TRIVIAL
AND
WORTHLESS
CAUSES
I
ALREADY
OWN
A
COOL
JACKET
I
RIDE
A
BICYCLE
TO
WORK
AND
PARK
IT
BEHIND
MY
DESK
AND
IF
MY
WOMAN
DECIDES
TO
GO
WITH
SOMEONE
ELSE
ID
BE
DISAPPOINTED
BUT
KILLING
HER
NEW
SUITOR
WILL
PROBABLY
NOT
ENDEAR
HER
TO
ME
ANY
MORE
THAN
BEFORE
FRANKLY
IVE
NEVER
MET
A
WOMAN
WORTH
KILLING
FOR
ANYWAY
NOW
AN
WITH
A
CHROME
BARREL
THATS
WORTH
KILLING
FOR
TOO
MUCH
OF
THIS
HAS
RUINED
YOU
CAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
RECOVERY
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
FEDERAL
MARTIALS

YOUR
ARMS

YOU
YOU

MORE
DANGEROUS

THEIR
THINKING

YOUR

PINHEAD

SOMETHING
