randy
weaver
trial
update
day
here
is
a
copy
of
my
first
update
on
the
randy
weaver
trial
after
a
large
response
about
email
messages
ive
decided
that
there
is
sufficient
interest
here
on
tpg
to
warrant
posting
file
follows
hi
folks
as
perhaps
the
only
boise
resident
on
the
list
i
guess
it
kind
of
falls
on
me
to
keep
people
updated
about
the
randy
weaverkevin
harris
trial
yesterday
marked
the
seating
of
the
jury
apparently
no
other
legal
activities
occurred
the
jury
was
selected
and
things
start
today
more
interesting
is
what
happenned
outside
about
a
dozen
weaver
supporters
showed
up
to
stage
a
protest
outside
the
courthouse
one
woman
carried
a
sign
that
read
who
stands
trial
for
the
murder
of
vicki
and
sons
name
i
forget
weaver
on
the
evening
news
she
said
i
am
here
protesting
because
i
believe
in
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
religion
i
thought
we
all
did
nice
sound
bite
grin
the
news
reporter
also
interviewed
some
guy
named
tim
who
refused
to
give
his
last
name
not
to
prejudge
the
guy
but
he
looked
like
a
neonazi
he
also
said
he
expected
many
neonazis
to
show
up
throughout
the
trial
tim
had
been
handing
out
leaflets
in
support
of
weaver
and
harris
and
the
news
had
footage
of
a
boise
cop
telling
him
to
move
along
or
hed
arrest
i
dont
know
the
finer
points
of
this
one
perhaps
theres
a
law
against
political
activity
within
x
feet
of
a
courthouse
or
something
what
happenned
to
the
first
amendment
most
ominous
of
all
was
that
the
local
reporter
filmed
an
agent
of
the
gestapoerratf
with
a
minicam
filming
the
protestors
welcome
to
the
world
of
big
brother
anyhow
gerry
spence
came
out
and
asked
the
protestors
to
leave
because
he
didnt
think
it
would
help
weavers
case
any
he
said
he
was
confident
that
once
the
evidence
came
out
that
weaver
would
be
aquitted
more
stuff
as
it
comes
available
drew
