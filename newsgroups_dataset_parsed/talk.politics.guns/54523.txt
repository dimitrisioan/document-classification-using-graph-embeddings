WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WACO
IS
NOT
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
BATF
IF
THEY
WOULD
OF
HAD
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PERSONAL
THEN
THEY
COULD
OF
CAPTURED
THE
COMPOUND
ON
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
AND
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
OF
HAPPENED
SEAL
TEAM
SIX
SHOULD
HAVE
HANDLED
IT
DELTA
FORCE
THE
BATF
HAD
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
EQUIPMENT
AND
MEN
THEY
DID
NOT
HAVE
GOOD
INTEL
BUT
THEY
DID
HAVE
POOR
PLANNING
THEY
FUCKED
UP
EVEN
IN
JUST
THE
MOST
BASIC
MILITARY
SENSE
THEY
FUCKED
UP
EXCUSES
DO
NOT
JUSTIFY
BODY
COUNTS
THE
BATF
NEEDS
MORE
PEOPLE
BETTER
WEAPONS
AND
MORE
ARMORED
TRANSPORTS
WHEN
THEY
MEET
HOSTILE
FIRE
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
MORE
FORCE
INSTEAD
OF
RETREATING
TO
A
STAND
OFF
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
A
JOB
THEN
DO
IT
RIGHT
THE
BATF
IS
THERE
TO
PROTECT
US
AND
THEY
MUST
HAVE
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PEOPLE
TO
DO
THE
JOB
AND
YOUR
EXCUSES
FALL
UPON
DEAF
EARS
WHEN
THE
SAME
BATF
HAS
SHOWN
SHITTY
LEADERSHIP
DESPITE
MORE
PEOPLE
BETTER
WEAPONS
AND
EXCLUSIVE
USE
OF
ARMOR
AGAINST
THEIR
TARGETS
BATF
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
PRIVATE
ARMY
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
DO
THE
AGENTS
SWEAR
AN
OATH
AS
I
DID
TO
UPHOLD
THE
CONSTITUTION
YOU

THE
HIGHEST
LAW
OF
THE
LAND
IF
THEY
DO
THEY
SHOULD
BE
UP
FOR
CHARGES
IN
A
COURT
OF
LAW
REMEMBER
THE
LAW
THATS
THE
WHOLE
REASON
FOR
ANY
OF
THIS
WITH
THE
WOD
AND
THE
INCREASED
CRIME
IN
THE
STREETS
THE
BATF
IS
NEEDED
MORE
NOW
THEN
EVER
IF
THEY
BLAST
AWAY
A
FEW
GOOD
FOKES
THEN
THAT
IS
THE
PRICE
WE
ALL
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
LAW
AND
ORDER
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
LOOK
AT
ALL
THE
GOOD
PEOPLE
THAT
DIED
IN

TO
PROTECT
THIS
GREAT
COUNTRY
OF
OURS
YEAH
IVE
BEEN
RELATED
TO
MANY
OF

THIS
IS
FLAMEBAIT
RIGHT
IM
NOT
PAYING
YOUR
PRICE
MIND
IF
I
SIGHT
IN
MY
GUNS
ON
YOUR

THINK
OF
IT
AS
THE

TO
HAVE
GOTTEN
YOU
CONVINCED
THAT
MY

A
FAIR
AND
UNBIASED
JUDICIARY
