NEXT
TIME
FROM

WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WACO
IS
NOT
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
BATF
IF
THEY
WOULD
OF
HAD
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PERSONAL
THEN
THEY
COULD
OF
CAPTURED
THE
COMPOUND
ON
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
AND
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
OF
HAPPENED
THEY
DID
HAVE
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THEY
WENT
ABOUT
THINGS
THE
WRONG
WAY
THE
ATF
SHOULD
HAVE
SERVED
THE
WARRANT
IN
A
PEACABLE
MANNER
INSTEAD
OF
GOING
IN
THERE
LIKE
A
BUNCH
OF
RAMBOS
WITH
GUNS
BLAZING
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
EXCUSE
WHAT
DAVID
KORESH
DID
IM
JUST
SAYING
THAT
THE
ATF
HENCEFORTH
TO
BE
KNOWN
AS
THE
CIGARETTE
COPS
WENT
ABOUT
THE
RAID
IN
AN
IMPROPER
MANNER
THE
BATF
NEEDS
MORE
PEOPLE
BETTER
WEAPONS
AND
MORE
ARMORED
TRANSPORTS
WHEN
THEY
MEET
HOSTILE
FIRE
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
MORE
FORCE
INSTEAD
OF
RETREATING
TO
A
STAND
OFF
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
A
JOB
THEN
DO
IT
RIGHT
THE
BATF
IS
THERE
TO
PROTECT
US
AND
THEY
MUST
HAVE
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PEOPLE
TO
DO
THE
JOB
LET
THE
FBI
CUSTOMS
AND
LOCAL
POLICE
OFFICERS
DO
THE
ATFS
JOB
WE
DONT
NEED
THEM
ANYMORE
THE
CIGARETTE
COPS
ARE
JUST
LEFTOVERS
FROM
PROHIBITION
DAYS
THEY
ARE
AN
ANACHRONISM
WITH
THE
WOD
AND
THE
INCREASED
CRIME
IN
THE
STREETS
THE
BATF
IS
NEEDED
MORE
NOW
THEN
EVER
IF
THEY
BLAST
AWAY
A
FEW
GOOD
FOKES
THEN
THAT
IS
THE
PRICE
WE
ALL
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
LAW
AND
ORDER
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
LOOK
AT
ALL
THE
GOOD
PEOPLE
THAT
DIED
IN
WARS
TO
PROTECT
THIS
GREAT
COUNTRY
OF
OURS
INCLUDING
YOU
WHAT
IF
THE
CIGARETTE
COPS
KICKED
DOWN
YOUR
DOOR
AND
CUT
YOU
IN
HALF
WITH
A
MACHINE
GUN
THIS
COULD
ACTUALLY
HAPPEN
MAYBE
THEY
GET
THE
WRONG
ADDRESS
AND
THEN
RAID
YOUR
HOME
FOR
EXAMPLE
ITS
HAPPENED
BEFORE
AND
IT
CAN
HAPPEN
AGAIN
I
HAVE
HEARD
OF
MORE
THAN
ONE
INSTANCE
OF
A
NOKNOCK
RAID
GOING
SOUR
JUST
RECENTLY
I
HEARD
ABOUT
A
CASE
IN
WHICH
POLICE
RAIDED
THIS
GUYS
HOME
BECAUSE
THEY
THOUGHT
HE
HAD
DOPE
OR
SOMETHING
THE
GUY
BLEW
BOTH
OF
THE
OFFICERS
AWAY
AND
HE
DIDNT
GO
TO
JAIL
FOR
IT
THE
JUDGE
HEARING
THE
CASE
RULED
THAT
THE
MAN
WAS
ACTING
IN
SELFDEFENSE
WITH
THE
ARMS
BUILD
UP
IN
WACO
THEY
NEEDED
TO
HIT
THAT
COMPOUND
WITH
MEGA
FIRE
POWER
THEY
COULD
OF
GONE
IN
THERE
BLASTING
AND
KILLED
A
FEW
WOMEN
AND
KIDS
BUT
IT
WOULD
OF
BEEN
BETTER
THEN
LETTING
THEM
ALL
BURN
TO
DEATH
DAYS
LATER
ARE
YOU
SURE
THAT
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
WAY
TO
GO
SURELY
THE
FBI
AND
ATF
COULD
HAVE
HANDLED
THIS
FIASCO
BETTER
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
MASSACRE
ALL
THOSE
PEOPLE
AS
STIMPY
SAID
IN
FAKE
DAD
SHAME
SHAME
DOUBLE
SHAME
THE
FBI
AND
ATF
SHOULD
BE
ASHAMED
OF
THEIRSELVES
SCOTT
KENNEDY
BREWER
AND
PATRIOT
BEFORE
DAVID
KORESH
IS
A
CHEAP
THUG
WHO
INTERPRETS
THE
BIBLE
THROUGH
THE
BARREL
OF
A
GUN
ATF
SPOKESMAN
AFTER
THE
ATF
IS
A
CHEAP
THUG
WHO
INTERPRETS
THE
CONSTITUTION
THROUGH
THE
BARREL
OF
A
GUN
ME
