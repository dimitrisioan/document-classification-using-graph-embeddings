the
entertainment
media
a
force
of
the
antigun
ruling
class
is
this
the
same
media
thats
made
billions
producing
films
and
television
that
glorify
guns
and
gun
users
or
is
that
another
antigun
media
youve
got
to
be
kidding
by
this
do
you
mean
that
you
consider
it
absolutely
impossible
for
the
media
to
be
guilty
of
hypocrisy
note
that
the
film
industry
in
california
traded
their
political
support
for
an
assault
weapon
ban
in
the
state
for
an
amendment
to
the
bill
exempting
the
entertainment
industry
from
that
very
ban
note
that
the
very
issue
of
the
batman
comic
book
seduction
of
the
gun
that
was
produced
as
a
tool
for
guncontrol
organizations
carries
a
back
page
ad
for
a
terminator
ii
video
game
extolling
the
numerous
and
varied
sophisticated
weapons
available
to
the
player
note
that
arthur
ochs
sulzberger
publisher
of
the
ny
times
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
incessant
guncontrol
grinders
himself
carries
a
concealed

still
you
find
it
completely
incredible
that
these
folks
live
by
the
aphorism
do
