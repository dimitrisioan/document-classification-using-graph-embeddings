can
you
imagine
what
happens
when
a
magazine
explodes
generally
the
ship
sinks
sorry
theres
a
picture
of
the
uss
iowa
next
to
my
desk
bullets
go
flying
every
where
imho
these
gunshot
wounds
were
actually
caused
when
the
magazines
went
up
first
unless
that
round
is
chambered
there
is
little
threat
of
penetration
by
the
bullet
or
the
brass
for
that
matter
unless
that
expanding
gas
is
held
in
an
enclosed
space
you
get
a
nice
pop
and
not
enough
threat
for
even
firefighters
to
worry
about
finally
its
rather
simple
to
tell
if
a
person
was
shot
prior
to
being
burned
to
a
crisp
see
by
the
time
the
ammunition
went
up
those
people
were
quite
dead
look
for
blood
around
the
wound
particularly
bruising
however
its
my
contention
that
it
makes
little
difference
whether
they
died
from
exploding
ammunition
or
fire
the
feds
seem
to
have
shared
responsibility
for
both
