any
death
is
serious
wanna
discuss
match
control
firearms
related
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
are
the
fault
of
one
or
more
negligent
persons
not
the
gun
no
i
dont
want
to
discuss
match
control
i
dont
equate
a
book
of
matches
to
a
loaded
millimeter
either
and
you
shouldnt
as
the
matches
kill
more
kids
so
why
are
you
bleating
about
guns
say
that
tired
old
nra
line
guns
dont
kill
people
people
kill
people
it
may
be
tired
but
it
is
true
sure
people
can
kill
people
without
guns
but
easy
access
to
guns
makes
it
a
lot
more
convenient
guns
dont
kill
people
people
with
easy
access
to
guns
kill
people
no
thats
not
right
either
people
who
have
both
easy
access
and
the
desire
to
kill
kill
people
considering
that
people
who
have
the
desire
to
kill
turn
that
into
easy
access
havent
you
folks
learned
anything
from
either
prohibition
or
the
war
on
drugs
if
you
dont
affect
the
desire
youre
wasting
your
time
not
to
mention
the
other
costs
incurred
jim
im
just
saying
how
it
is
im
not
saying
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
not
from
the
police
who
i
have
talked
with
who
run
some
of
these
gun
buyback
programs
i
get
the
impression
that
they
really
think
they
are
having
an
impact
on
the
community
good
for
them
i
note
that
the
tm
folks
make
the
same
argument
if
youll
pay
their
expesnses
million
for
a
reasonable
size
city
they
promise
to
meditate
away
all
crime
disease
etc
at
least
theyre
not
promising
to
jail
me
if
i
dont
go
along
with
their
little
plan
theyre
going
to
just
sit
in
a
room
and
fly
leaving
me
alone
gun
violence
whether
its
effective
or
not
look
if
you
cant
measure
the
impact
of
these
programs
using
some
sort
of
pretest
and
posttest
evaluation
what
is
the
point
it
must
be
symbolic
in
nature
ah
but
we
have
evaluated
gun
control
using
beforeafter
and
it
doesnt
work
to
reduce
crime
what
is
the
point
we
cant
claim
that
it
is
symbolic
as
people
do
get
jailed
the
police
are
essentially
saying
look
if
you
have
a
gun
lying
around
and
you
dont
want
it
well
give
you
for
itbecause
we
care
about
the
community
no
theyre
essentially
saying
we
hope
this
will
keep
you
from
noticing
that
were
not
doing
anything
useful
pissing
away
resources
isnt
caring
if
you
i
and
joe
could
think
of
a
way
to
measure
the
effectiveness
or
ineffectiveness
of
these
programs
we
could
become
rich
and
famous
nope
youll
merely
be
ignored
as
wright
rossi
and
daly
were
after
finishing
under
the
gun
they
were
supposed
to
prove
that
gun
control
worked
so
jim
listen
to
me
i
said
im
not
religious
whatsoever
do
you
understand
religion
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
could
care
less
what
religion
they
were
okay
to
put
children
in
that
situation
is
wrong
pure
and
simple
difference
is
good
jim
i
am
the
most
progressive
and
diverse
person
in
the
world
but
if
different
is
allowing
kids
to
be
exposed
to
tanks
and
teargas
then
yes
jim
different
is
wrong
so
who
gassed
them
given
their
previous
experience
with
thugs
who
threw
grenades
before
yelling
were
from
the
govt
and
were
here
to
help
you
would
a
rational
person
think
that
the
feds
had
their
best
interests
at
heart
would
you
know
that
the
gas
was
nonlethal
