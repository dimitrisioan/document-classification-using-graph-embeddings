and
a
few
other
questions
like
i
said
i
believe
the
actions
taken
in
general
were
proper
but
i
still
have
some
reservations
weve
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
brainwashing
in
waco
but
the
brainwashing
of
the
general
population
never
ceases
to
amaze
me
here
is
an
example
of
action
being
taken
which
results
in
the
worst
possible
outcome
and
despite
peoples
deep
intuition
telling
them
something
is
wrong
the
programming
will
still
cut
in
and
say
that
the
agents
probably
acted
in
good
faith
no
they
didnt
they
either
did
not
have
enough
information
to
act
in
good
faith
or
else
they
acted
knowing
the
risk
sums
up
human
stupidity
all
over
and
one
of
these
days
it
will
destroy
the
fucking
planet
oh
sorry
didnt
think
they
would
respond
by
launching
a
strike
all
our
best
calculations
told
us
they
were
bluffing
