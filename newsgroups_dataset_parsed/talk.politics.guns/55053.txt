DON
KATES
TALK
ON
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
THIS
WAS
POSTED
BY
LYN
BATES
TO
THE
FIREARMSPOLITICS
MAILING
LIST
I
RECENTLY
LEARNED
THAT
DON
KATES
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
IN
BOSTON
TO
GIVE
A
TALK
AT
THE
HARBARD
LAW
SCHOOL
ABOUT
THE
WACO
SITUATION
OF
COURSE
THIS
WAS
ALL
SET
UP
AFTER
THE
INCIDENT
STARTED
BUT
LONG
BEFORE
ITS
UNHAPPY
CONCLUSION
SO
YESTERDAY
I
WENT
TO
HEAR
HIM
WHAT
FOLLOWS
IS
A
ROUGH
SUMMARY
OF
WHAT
I
THINK
I
HEARD
HIM
SAY
WHICH
SHOULD
NOT
BE
TAKEN
AS
EXACTLY
WHAT
HE
ACTUALLY
SAID
KATES
STARTED
BY
SAYING
THAT
SINCE
HE
DIDNT
KNOW
ANY
MORE
ABOUT
THE
FIRE
THAN
THE
AUDIENCE
DID
IT
HAD
JUST
HAPPENED
THE
DAY
BEFORE
HE
WOULD
NOT
DISCUSS
THAT
BUT
WOULD
CONCENTRATE
ON
THE
ORIGINAL
RAID
KORESH
DEFINITELY
WAS
NOT
PLAYING
WITH
A
FULL
DECK
BUT
SO
WHAT
THIS
ISNT
THE
FIRST
TIME
THAT
THE
LEADER
OF
A
NEW
SMALL
RELIGIOUS
GROUP
HAS
BEEN
RIDICULED
BY
THE
PUBLIC
EXTREME
RELIGIOUS
VIEWS
NEARLY
ALWAYS
FUEL
HATRED
AND
MISTRUST
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
APPLIES
MAYBE
ESPECIALLY
TO
PEOPLE
LIKE
KORESH
LENGTHY
DIGRESSION
INTO
THE
HISTORY
OF
POLICE
ORGANIZATIONS
IN
THE
US
THERE
WERE
NONE
UNTIL
ABOUT
WHEN
THEY
BEGAN
IN
METROPOLITAN
AREAS
POLICE
ORIGINALLY
WERE
NOT
ARMED
IF
THEY
FOUND
A
CRIME
IN
PROGRESS
THEY
CALLED
LOCAL
ARMED
CITIZENS
TO
HELP
MANY
BEGAN
TO
CARRY
ARMS
FOR
PROTECTION
DESPITE
REGULATIONS
AGAINST
THEM
EVENTUALLY
THE
LAWS
WERE
CHANGED
TO
ALLOW
THEM
TO
CARRY
GUNS
THE
ORIGINAL
INTENT
WAS
TO
HAVE
MANY
SMALL
POLICE
DEPARTMENTS
JEALOUS
OF
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
COMPETITIVE
BUT
NOT
LARGE
ENOUGH
TO
BE
A
THREAT
TO
LIBERTY
HENCE
THE
PLETHORA
OF
ORGANIZATIONS
RANGING
FROM
POSTAL
INSPECTORS
TO
THE
COAST
GUARD
WHEN
THE
FBI
WAS
STARTED
AGENTS
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
OTO
CARRY
GUNS
THEY
WERE
TO
BE
AFTER
ALL
A
BUREAU
OF
INVESTIGATION
NOT
A
POLICE
FORCE
ALL
POLICE
AGENCIES
WILL
BE
MISUSED
BY
ANYONE
IN
POWER
TO
MAINTAIN
THAT
POWER
THE
BATF
STARTED
AS
A
TAX
COLLECTION
AGENCY
WHOSE
PRIMARY
JOB
WAS
TO
RAID
ILLEGAL
STILLS
WHEN
THE
PRICE
OF
SUGAR
WENT
UP
SO
HIGH
THAT
MOONSHINERS
NO
LONGER
FOUND
THEIR
TRADE
NO
LONGER
PROFITABLE
MANY
ILLEGAL
STILLS
DISAPPEARED
AND
THE
BATF
NEEDED
SOMETHING
ELSE
TO
DO
TO
JUSTIFY
ITS
EXISTENCE
SO
IT
TURNED
TO
ACTIVITIES
LIKE
PHONY
RAIDS
ON
GUN
STORES
AROUND
THE
TIME
WHEN
THE
BATFS
ANNUAL
BUDGET
IS
UNDER
REVIEW
THE
MEDIA
IS
ALERTED
BY
THE
BATF
TO
COME
TO
SUCHANDSUCH
A
PLACE
WHERE
AT
A
PREARRANGED
TIME
A
BUNCH
OF
CARS
FULL
OF
BATF
AGENTS
ROAR
UP
TO
THE
DOOR
AND
THE
MEDIA
GET
GREAT
PICTURES
OF
THE
AGENTS
ENTERING
THE
PREMISES
OF
A
GUN
DEALER
SUSPECTED
OF
NOT
KEEPING
BOOKS
PROPERLY
THE
MEDIA
ISNT
INVITED
IN
FOR
THE
BORING
HOURS
OF
AGENTS
LEAFING
THROUGH
PAPERWORK
BUT
IF
ANY
IRREGULARITIES
ARE
FOUND
THE
MEDIA
GETS
TO
COVER
THE
AGENTS
REMOVING
ARMFULS
OF
GUNS
FROM
THE
PREMISES
AND
THE
LUCKLESS
FFL
IN
CHAINS
THE
WACO
INCIDENT
HAPPENED
A
FEW
WEEKS
BEFORE
BATFS
BUDGET
WAS
UP
FOR
REVIEW
KATES
OPINION
IS
THAT
IT
WAS
A
STAGED
PUBLICITY
STUNT
THAT
WENT
BAD
AND
THAT
THE
BATF
NEVER
THOUGHT
FOR
A
MOMENT
THAT
THEY
WOULD
ACTUALLY
BE
SHOT
AT
OR
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
PLANNED
THE
RAID
DIFFERENTLY
NOT
SENDING
AGENTS
OVER
OPEN
GROUND
WITH
NO
COVER
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
SOME
MEDICAL
PERSONNEL
ON
HAND
HE
CONFIRMED
THAT
SOME
YEARS
AGO
THERE
WAS
A
WARRANT
FOR
KORESHS
ARREST
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
A
MURDER
CHARGE
AND
THE
LOCAL
SHERIFF
CALLED
HIM
ON
THE
PHONE
AND
EXPLAINED
ABOUT
IT
KORESH
SAIS
OK
COME
PICK
ME
UP
AND
THE
SHERIFF
DID
TEMPORARILY
CONFISCATING
ALL
THE
GUNS
SO
THAT
THEY
COULD
BE
TESTED
KORESH
WAS
LATER
CLEARED
RELEASE
AND
PRESUMABLY
GOT
HIS
GUNS
BACK
AT
LEAST
AT
THAT
TIME
HE
WAS
RATIONAL
ENOUGH
TO
BE
APPROACHED
RATIONALLY
AND
BEHAVED
IN
A
REASONABLE
MANNER
THE
BATF
DIDNT
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
THAT
UNLIKE
MOST
OF
THE
FFLS
THEY
AUDIT
KORESH
WAS
ACTUALLY
PARANOID
AND
FOSTERED
PARANOIA
IN
HIS
FOLLOWERS
THUS
THE
PUBICITY
STUNT
LOOKED
LIKE
A
REAL
ATTACK
TO
THEM
AND
THEY
REACTED
ACCORDINGLY
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
WARRANT
IT
HAD
NOT
BEEN
UNSEALED
WHEN
KATES
WAS
GIVING
HIS
TALK
SO
HE
COULD
NOT
COMMENT
ON
IT
EXCEPT
TO
MENTION
THAT
THE
BATF
HAS
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
NOT
DOUBLECHECK
THE
VERACTIY
OF
THEIR
INFORMANTS
IF
THEY
CAN
MANAGE
TO
GET
A
JUDGE
TO
ISSUE
A
WARRANT
HE
HAD
MORE
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THE
WAY
THE
WARRANT
WAS
SERVED
WHICH
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
COMPLETELY
ILLEGAL
APPARENTLY
THE
PROPER
WAY
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
IS
TO
KNOCK
ON
THE
DOOR
AND
ANNOUNCE
THAT
YOURE
AN
OFFICER
WITH
A
WARRANT
FOR
THUSANDSO
IF
THEY
DONT
OPEN
THE
DOOR
AND
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
FLUSHABLE
THEN
IT
IS
OK
TO
BREAK
IN
THE
DOOR
BUT
SINCE
IT
IS
HARD
TO
FLUSH
GUNS
DOWN
THE
TOILET
THERE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
NO
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
THE
BATF
BREAKING
IN
THE
WAY
THEY
DID
IF
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS
OF
THE
DAVIDIANS
WERE
VIOLATED
BY
AN
INVALID
WARRANT
OR
BY
AN
IMPROPERLY
SERVED
WARRANT
THEN
THE
DAVIDIANS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
JUSTIFIED
IN
THEIR
ACTONS
A
CLOSE
LOOK
AT
ONE
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
FILMS
SHOWS
THAT
ONE
BATF
AGENT
MAY
HAVE
SHOT
HIMSELF
BY
ACCIDENT
WHEN
ENTERING
THE
BUILDING
IF
SO
THIS
WAS
THE
FIRST
SHOT
FIRED
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
MEDIA
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
WHOLE
LOT
WORSE
AFTER
AN
INITIAL
POSITION
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BATF
THE
MEDIA
BEGAN
TO
COME
AROUND
TO
THE
VIEW
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
BE
A
SITUATION
IN
WHICH
LEGALLY
ARMED
CITIZENS
HELD
OFF
A
BAD
POSSIBLY
ILLEGAL
ATTACK
A
REAL
CYNIC
MIGHT
SAY
THAT
THE
FBI
WENT
IN
WHEN
THEY
DID
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
CLEAR
THAT
PUBLIC
OPINION
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
CHANGE
SIDES
AND
THE
FBI
WANTED
TO
ACT
BEFORE
THEY
LOST
THE
PUBLICS
SYMPATHY
SHOULD
THE
BATF
BE
ABOLISHED
NO
POLICE
AGENCIES
SHOULD
BE
NUMEROUS
DIVERSE
INEFFICIENT
DECENTRALIZED
ETC
BETTER
A
FEW
INEPT
ACCIDENTS
LIKE
THIS
THAN
A
MOVE
TOWARD
A
SINGLE
LARGE
WELLORGANIZED
WELLTRAINED
POWERFUL
DOMESTIC
POLICE
FORCE
WHICH
WOULD
EVENTUALLY
HAVE
EVEN
MORE
TRAGIC
RESULTS
