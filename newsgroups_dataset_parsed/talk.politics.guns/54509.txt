PRESS
RELEASE
FROM
THE
WHITE

PRESIDENT
CLINTONS
REMARKS
ON

QA

DESK
CONTACT
WHITE

APRIL
US
NEWSWIRE
FOLLOWING
ARE
REMARKS
BY
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
IN
A
QUESTION
AND
ANSWER
SESSION
WITH
THE
PRESS
PART
OF
GO
AHEAD
SARAH
Q
THERE
ARE
TWO
QUESTIONS
I
WANT
TO
ASK
YOU
THE
FIRST
IS
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
KNEW
VERY
WELL
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
DID
NOT
HAVE
GAS
MASKS
WHILE
THE
ADULTS
DID
SO
THE
CHILDREN
HAD
NO
CHANCE
BECAUSE
THIS
GAS
WAS
VERY
SHE
SAID
IT
WAS
NOT
LETHAL
BUT
IT
WAS
VERY
DANGEROUS
TO
THE
CHILDREN
AND
THEY
COULD
NOT
HAVE
SURVIVED
WITHOUT
GAS
MASKS
AND
ON
FEBRUARY
LETS
GO
BACK
DIDNT
THOSE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
PRACTICE
THEIR
RELIGION
THE
PRESIDENT
THEY
WERE
NOT
JUST
PRACTICING
THEIR
RELIGION
THEY
WERE
THE
TREASURY
DEPARTMENT
BELIEVED
THAT
THEY
HAD
VIOLATED
FEDERAL
LAWS
ANY
NUMBER
OF
THEM
Q
WHAT
FEDERAL
LAWS
THE
PRESIDENT
LET
ME
GO
BACK
AND
ANSWER
I
CANT
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
ABOUT
THE
GAS
MASKS
EXCEPT
TO
TELL
YOU
THAT
THE
WHOLE
PURPOSE
OF
USING
THE
TEAR
GAS
WAS
THAT
IT
HAD
BEEN
TESTED
THEY
WERE
CONVINCED
THAT
IT
WOULDNT
KILL
EITHER
A
CHILD
OR
AN
ADULT
BUT
IT
WOULD
FORCE
ANYBODY
THAT
BREATHED
IT
TO
RUN
OUTSIDE
AND
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
IVE
HEARD
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GET
INTO
THE
DETAILS
OF
THIS
BECAUSE
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
THEY
WERE
SPECULATING
ABOUT
TODAY
WAS
THAT
THE
WIND
WAS
BLOWING
SO
FAST
THAT
THE
WINDOWS
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
OPENED
AND
SOME
OF
THE
GAS
MIGHT
HAVE
ESCAPED
AND
THAT
MAY
BE
WHY
IT
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
DESIRED
EFFECT
THEY
ALSO
KNEW
SARAH
THAT
THERE
WAS
AN
UNDERGROUND
COMPOUND
A
BUS
BURIED
UNDERGROUND
WHERE
THE
CHILDREN
COULD
BE
SENT
AND
THEY
WERE
I
THINK
THEY
WERE
HOPING
VERY
MUCH
THAT
IF
THE
CHILDREN
WERE
NOT
RELEASED
IMMEDIATELY
OUTSIDE
THAT
THE
HUMANE
THING
WOULD
BE
DONE
AND
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
WOULD
BE
SENT
SOMEPLACE
WHERE
THEY
COULD
BE
PROTECTED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
GAS
MASKS
THEMSELVES
I
LEARNED
YESTERDAY
I
DID
NOT
ASK
THIS
FACT
QUESTION
BEFORE
THAT
THE
GAS
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
STAY
ACTIVE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
LONGER
THAN
THE
GAS
MASKS
THEMSELVES
WERE
TO
WORK
SO
THAT
IT
WAS
THOUGHT
THAT
EVEN
IF
THEY
ALL
HAD
GAS
MASKS
THAT
EVENTUALLY
THE
GAS
WOULD
FORCE
THEM
OUT
IN
A
NONVIOLENT
NONSHOOTING
CIRCUMSTANCE
MS
MYERS
LAST
QUESTION
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
WHY
ARE
YOU
STILL
SAYING
THAT
Q
COULD
YOU
TELL
US
WHETHER
OR
NOT
YOU
EVER
ASKED
JANET
RENO
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
MASS
SUICIDE
AND
WHEN
YOU
LEARNED
ABOUT
THE
ACTUAL
FIRE
AND
EXPLOSION
WHAT
WENT
THROUGH
YOUR
MIND
DURING
THOSE
HORRENDOUS
MOMENTS
THE
PRESIDENT
WHAT
I
ASKED
JANET
RENO
IS
IF
THEY
HAD
CONSIDERED
ALL
THE
WORSE
THINGS
THAT
COULD
HAPPEN
AND
SHE
SAID
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
WHOLE
ISSUE
OF
SUICIDE
HAD
BEEN
RAISED
IN
THE
PUBLIC
HE
HAD
THAT
HAD
BEEN
DEBATED
ANYWAY
AND
SHE
SAID
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
MOST
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT
THESE
KINDS
OF
ISSUES
CONCLUDED
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
GREATER
RISK
OF
THAT
NOW
THAN
THERE
WOULD
BE
TOMORROW
OR
THE
NEXT
DAY
OR
THE
DAY
AFTER
THAT
OR
AT
ANYTIME
IN
THE
FUTURE
THAT
WAS
THE
JUDGMENT
THEY
MADE
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
RIGHT
OR
WRONG
OF
COURSE
WE
WILL
NEVER
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
WHEN
I
SAW
THE
FIRE
WHEN
I
SAW
THE
BUILDING
BURNING
I
WAS
SICK
I
FELT
TERRIBLE
AND
MY
IMMEDIATE
CONCERN
WAS
WHETHER
THE
CHILDREN
HAD
GOTTEN
OUT
AND
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
ESCAPING
OR
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
INSIDE
TRYING
TO
BURN
THEMSELVES
UP
THATS
THE
FIRST
THING
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
THANK
YOU
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
WHY
ARE
YOU
STILL
SAYING
IT
WAS
A
JANET
RENO
DECISION
ISNT
IT
IN
THE
END
YOUR
DECISION
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
WHAT
IM
SAYING
IS
THAT
I
DIDNT
HAVE
A
FOUR
OR
FIVEHOUR
DETAILED
BRIEFING
FROM
THE
FBI
I
DIDNT
GO
OVER
EVERY
STRATEGIC
PART
OF
IT
IT
IS
A
DECISION
FOR
WHICH
I
TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
IM
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
I
SIGNED
OFF
ON
THE
GENERAL
DECISION
AND
GIVING
HER
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
MAKE
THE
LAST
CALL
WHEN
I
TALKED
TO
HER
ON
SUNDAY
SOME
TIME
HAD
ELAPSED
SHE
MIGHT
HAVE
MADE
A
DECISION
TO
CHANGE
HER
MIND
I
SAID
IF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
GO
FORWARD
WITH
THIS
TOMORROW
I
WILL
SUPPORT
YOU
AND
I
DO
SUPPORT
HER
SHE
IS
NOT
ULTIMATELY
RESPONSIBLE
TO
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
I
AM
BUT
I
THINK
SHE
HAS
CONDUCTED
HER
DUTIES
IN
AN
APPROPRIATE
FASHION
AND
SHE
HAS
DEALT
WITH
THIS
SITUATION
I
THINK
AS
WELL
AS
SHE
COULD
HAVE
THANK
YOU
APPLAUSE
