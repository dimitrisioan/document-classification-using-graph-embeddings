WRITES
FROM
AP
ACCORDING
TO
NUMEROUS
ACCOUNTS
BY
THOSE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
THE
FIRE
WAS
STARTED
BY
AN
ARMOURED
VEHICLE
CRUSHING
A
LARGE
PROPANE
TANK
AND
TURNING
OVER
NUMEROUS
GAS
LANTERNS
IF
THERE
WAS
A
LARGE
PROPANE
TANK
AND
IT
WAS
BREACHED
DONT
YOU
THINK
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
AN
IDENTIFIABLE
EXPLOSION
THERE
WAS
AT
LEAST
ONE
BLAST
CONSISTENT
WITH
PETROLEUM
PRODUCTS
THAT
I
SAW
HOWEVER
PROPANE
IS
INTERESTING
STUFF
IT
DOESNT
EXPLODE
ON
CONTACT
WITH
AIR
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
TANK
TO
RUPTURE
WITHOUT
EXPLODING
FAR
MORE
LIKELY
HOWEVER
IS
THAT
THE
COMPOUND
WAS
EQUIPPED
WITH
NG
OUTLETS
RUNNING
TO
THE
TANK
DAMAGE
FROM
THE
CEVS
COULD
HAVE
RUPTURED
THE
GAS
LINES
ALLOWING
THE
GAS
TO
SPREAD
UNNOTICED
IN
THE
CS
FUMES
AND
GENERAL
EXCITEMENT
PROPANE
TYPICALLY
HAS
A
DISTINCTIVE
ODOR
ADDED
TO
IT
FOR
JUST
THIS
REASON
TO
SMELL
LEAKS
UNTIL
REACHING
A
FLAME
OR
SPARK
AND
THEN
WHOOOSH
FIRE
EVERYWHERE
AND
MAYBE
AN
EXPLOSION
USE
OF
NG
IS
PRETTY
COMMON
IN
TEXAS
ESPECIALLY
SEMIRURAL
AREAS
FURTHER
THE
BD
MEMBERS
HAVE
AS
MUCH
REASON
TO
LIE
AS
THE
GOVT
THIS
IS
TRUE
BUT
SO
FAR
THE
FBIBATF
TRACK
RECORD
ON
THIS
INCIDENT
IS
VERY
BAD
I
FIND
IT
TREMENDOUSLY
CHILLING
THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
SEEM
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
GOVERNMENTS
STORY
DESPITE
MUCH
EVIDENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
THE
ONLY
EVIDENCE
THAT
EXISTS
RIGHT
NOW
AT
LEAST
WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
IS
VARIOUS
CLAIMS
AND
COUNTER
CLAIMS
IM
WAITING
UNTIL
THE
HARD
EVIDENCE
IS
RELEASED
WHAT
ABOUT
YOU
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
HAVE
DISARMED
MANY
PEOPLE
IF
THE
FBI
FOLLOWED
THIS
SAME
POLICY
THEY
HAVE
NOT
THEY
ARE
MAKING
CLAIMS
WITHOUT
EVIDENCE
AND
WHAT
EVIDENCE
WE
HAVE
SO
FAR
TENDS
TO
REFUTE
THEIR
STORY
SEMPER

I
DONT
SPEAK
FOR

WHICH
IS
TOO
BAD
BECAUSE
THEY
COULD
USE
