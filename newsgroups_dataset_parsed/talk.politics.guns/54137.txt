re
ban
all
firearms
as
quoted
from
by
jrmgnvifasufledu
firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
all
production
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
firearms
from
scratch
highranking
crime
figures
could
obtain
imported
uzis
and
such
but
the
average
person
and
average
thug
would
be
lucky
to
get
a
zipgun
and
would
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
you
dont
know
much
about
modern
automatic
weapons
do
you
just
about
anybody
with
basic
manufacturing
skill
can
turn
out
high
quality
submachineguns
a
couple
of
high
school
shop
teachers
were
recently
arrested
for
building
submachineguns
in
the
school
shop
i
suggest
that
you
go
to
the
library
and
find
a
copy
of
smallarms
of
the
world
your
entire
premise
is
based
on
nonfactual
assumptions
youre
like
a
bunch
of
overeducated
new
york
jewish
aclu
lawyers
fighting
to
eliminate
school
prayer
from
the
public
schools
in
arkansas
