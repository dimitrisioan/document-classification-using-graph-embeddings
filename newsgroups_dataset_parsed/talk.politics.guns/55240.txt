A

FOUND
THAT
A

IN

WAS
TIMES
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
USED
TO
KILL
ITS
OWNER
SPOUSE
A
FRIEND
OR
CHILD
THAN
TO

AN

THIS
IS
AN
OFTENQUOTED
STATISTIC
AND
IT
IS
MISLEADING
FOR
SEV
ERAL
REASONS
OUTLINED
BELOW
THE
STUDY
GIVES
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
IF
YOU
OWN
A
GUN
THE
LIKELIHOOD
THAT
YOU
WILL
SUCCESSFULLY
USE
IT
TO
DEFEND
YOURSELF
IS
LESS
THAN
THAT

THE
