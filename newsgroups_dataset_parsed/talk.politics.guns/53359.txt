WASHINGTON
MARCH
FOLLOWING
IS
A
STATEMENT
OF
SARAH
BRADY
REGARDING
TEXAS
STATE
CARRYING
CONCEALED
LEGISLATION
A
HANDFUL
OF
LAWMAKERS
IN
AUSTIN
TODAY
HAVE
TOLD
THE
PUBLIC
THAT
THEIR
SAFETY
IS
OF
LESS
IMPORTANCE
THAN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
THE
NATIONAL
RIFLE
ASSOCIATION
THIS
ACTION
COMES
AS
LOCAL
STATE
AND
FEDERAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS
CONTINUE
THEIR
STANDOFF
WITH
A
RELIGIOUS
CULT
THAT
HAS
HIGHLIGHTED
THE
NEED
FOR
TOUGHER
GUN
LAWS
NOT
WEAKER
ONES
LIKE
THE
CARRY
CONCEALED
BILL
A
HANDFUL
OF
ANTIGUN
ZEALOTS
ARE
TELLING
THE
PUBLIC
THAT
THEIR
RIGHT
TO
SELFDEFENSE
IS
OF
LESS
IMPORTANCE
THAN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
HANDGUN
CONTROL
INC
THIS
ACTION
COMES
AS
LOCAL
STATE
AND
FEDERAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS
CONTINUE
THEIR
ASSAULT
ON
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIAN
COMPOUNDAN
ASSAULT
WHICH
HAS
ALREADY
RESULTED
IN
THE
DEATH
OF
ONE
TWO
YEAR
OLD
CHILD
AT
THE
HANDS
OF
FEDERAL
AGENTS
THIS
HAS
HIGHLIGHTED
THE
NEED
FOR
CITIZENS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
AGAINST
THE
EXCESSES
OF
THEIR
OWN
GOVERNMENT
ANY
SUGGESTION
BY
PROPONENTS
THAT
THIS
BILL
WILL
HELP
TO
REDUCE
CRIME
IS
A
DISTORTION
OF
THE
FACTS
AT
BEST
THIS
SOCALLED
CRIMEFIGHTING
LAW
HAS
RESULTED
IN
A
PERCENT
INCREASE
IN
VIOLENT
CRIME
IN
THE
STATE
OF
FLORIDA
AND
I
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS
BRAGGING
THAT
MORE
GUNS
ON
THE
STREETS
IS
THE
WAY
TO
REDUCE
CRIME
ANY
SUGGESTION
BY
OPPONENTS
THAT
THIS
BILL
WILL
INCREASE
CRIME
IS
A
DISTORTION
OF
THE
FACTS
AT
BEST
THE
AGGRESSIVE
OUTREACH
BY
OFFICIALS
IN
CENTRAL
FLORIDA
TO
TRAIN
AND
ARM
WOMEN
HAS
LED
TO
A
DRAMATIC
DROP
IN
THE
LEVEL
OF
ASSAULT
AND
RAPE
IN
THAT
AREA
OF
COURSE
THIS
PROGRAM
IS
A
RARE
GEM
AS
MANY
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS
APPARENTLY
BELIEVE
THAT
AN
UNARMED
CITIZENRY
WILL
BE
EASIER
TO
CONTROL
AND
THUS
FAVOR
TIGHTER
RESTRICTIONS
THE
VOTE
TODAY
IS
AN
INSULT
TO
THE

WHO
ARE
PUTTING
THEIR
LIVES
ON
THE
LINE
EVERY
DAY
TO
END
THE
STANDOFF
IN
WACO
THE
ENTIRE
COUNTRY
NOW
KNOWS
JUST
HOW
EASY
IT
IS
FOR
AN
INDIVIDUAL
BENT
ON
DESTRUCTION
TO
AMASS
AN
ARSENAL
OF

TEXAS
LAWMAKERS
WHO
VOTED

FOR
THOSE

OFFICIALS
ON

THE

THE

TODAY
IS
A

TO
THE

WHO

PUTTING
THEIR

ON
THE

EVERY
DAY
AS
THEY
GO
ABOUT

THE

KNOWS
HOW
VULNERABLE
THE

IS
BOTH
TO

FROM

FROM
