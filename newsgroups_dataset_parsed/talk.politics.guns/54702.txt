RE
JFFO
HAS
GONE
A
BIT
TOO
FAR
HAVING
READ
THE
POSTED
LONG
ARTICLE
BY
JPFO
I
HAVE
SOME
OBSERVATIONS
THIS
ARTICLE
DOES
NOT
CLAIM
THAT
THE
GCA
OF
IS
A
VERBATIM
TRANSLATION
OF
A
NAZI
LAW
WHAT
IT
SAYS
IS
THAT
IN
ANOTHER
PLACE
THE
BOOK
THEYRE
TALKING
ABOUT
THEY
COMPARE
THE
TWO
THINGS
SECTION
BY
SECTION
THE
IMPLICATION
IS
THAT
THE
SIMILARITIES
ARE
DEVASTATING
IN
THE
NEXT
SENTENCE
THEY
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
IN
THAT
BOOK
THEY
REPRODUCE
THE
GERMAN
TEXT
OF
THE
NAZI
LAW
TOGETHER
WITH
ITS
TRANSLATION
NOT
SURPRISINGLY
A
READER
COULD
EASILY
CONFLATE
THESE
TWO
THINGS
INTO
A
SINGLE
IDEA
THAT
THE
AMERICAN
GCA
IS
A
LITERAL
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
NAZI
LAW
AND
SURE
ENOUGH
THATS
WHAT
THE
WHOLE
THING
HAS
MUTATED
INTO
URBANFOLKLORE
STYLE
THE
ARTICLE
GOES
TO
GREAT
PAINS
TO
ESTABLISH
THAT
SENATOR
DODD
HAD
A
COPY
OF
THE
NAZI
LAW
EITHER
FROM
HIS
TIME
ON
THE
NURNBERG
PROSECUTION
TEAM
OR
LATER
THIS
FACT
IS
CONSIDERED
HIGHLY
INCRIMINATING
BUT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THE
AUTHOR
REPEATS
SEVERAL
TIMES
THAT
HE
IS
SIMPLY
UNABLE
TO
IMAGINE
HOW
ANYONE
COULD
COME
INTO
POSSESSION
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
TEXT
AND
YET
IN
A
PARAGRAPH
TOWARDS
THE
END
HE
EXPLAINS
IT
PERFECTLY
IF
DODD
GOT
HIS
COPY
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
GERMAN
TEXT
OF
THE
NAZI
WEAPONS
LAW
DURING
HIS
TIME
AT
NURNBERG
IT
LIKELY
WAS
PART
OF
A
COLLECTION
OF
DOCUMENTS
FOR
EXAMPLE
ISSUES
OF
THE
REICHSGESETZBLATT
THE
GERMAN
LAW
REGISTRY
BINGO
EXACTLY
DODD
HAD
A
BOOK
WITH
A
SERIES
OF
NAZI
LAWS
IN
IT
INCLUDING
THE
ONE
UNDER
DISCUSSION
ALL
OF
THE
STUFF
ABOUT
WHY
WOULD
A
US
CONGRESSMAN
HAVE
A
COPY
OF
A
NAZI
LAW
MELTS
AWAY
BY
THE
AUTHORS
ADMISSION
HE
THEN
CONTINUES
BUT
IF
HE
ACQUIRED
THE
ORIGINAL
GERMAN
TEXT
OF
THE
NAZI
WEAPONS
LAW
AFTER
HIS
SERVICE
AT
NURNBERG
HE
MUST
HAVE
DONE
SO
FOR
A
VERY
SPECIFIC
REASON
BUT
THERES
ABSOLUTELY
NO
REASON
TO
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
IN
FACT
AS
A
SENIOR
MEMBER
OF
THE
US
TEAM
THAT
HELPED
TO
PROSECUTE
NAZI
WAR
CRIMINALS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
HAVE
A
COPY
ALL
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
NAZI
WEAPON
LAW
IS
REALLY
OF
HISTORICAL
INTEREST
AS
IT
OBVIOUSLY
IS
CERTAINLY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
AUTHOR
HERE
OR
WHETHER
DODD
PERSONALLY
PROSECUTED
THE
INTERIOR
MINISTER
WHO
SIGNED
IT
CAN
BE
PUT
ASIDE
AS
RED
HERRINGS
HAVING
ESTABLISHED
THAT
DODD
OWNED
A
COPY
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
GERMAN
TEXT
THE
JPFO
ARTICLE
THEN
TRIES
TO
DRAW
SINISTER
IMPLICATIONS
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
ASKED
TO
HAVE
IT
TRANSLATED
THE
PROBLEM
IS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
CHARGE
LEVELLED
AT
DODD
THESE
TWO
THINGS
WORK
AGAINST
EACH
OTHER
PEOPLE
ASK
TO
HAVE
THINGS
TRANSLATED
WHEN
THEY
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
MEAN
IF
DODD
TOOK
IT
UPON
HIMSELF
TO
PRESERVE
THE
NAZI
LAW
WITH
IDEA
OF
SOMEDAY
INTRODUCING
IT
INTO
AMERICAN
LAW
SURELY
BY
HE
WOULD
HAVE
KNOW
WHAT
IT
MEANT
WOULDNT
HE
ANYWAY
THIS
PRECISE
CHARGE
THE
MAIN
ONE
THAT
I
QUESTIONED
IN
AN
EARLIER
POSTING
IS
JUST
SILLY
WHY
WOULD
DODD
NEED
THE
EXACT
TRANSLATION
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
IS
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
GUN
CONTROLLERS
DESPITE
BEING
PRESUMABLY
BENT
ON
DISARMING
THE
POPULACE
WITH
THE
GOAL
OF
EVENTUALLY
DESTROYING
ALL
CIVIL
LIBERTIES
NEEDED
A
CRIB
SHEET
DIDNT
THEY
HAVE
ANY
IDEA
HOW
TO
DO
IT
ON
THEIR
OWN
ONCE
AGAIN
THE
AUTHOR
PROVIDES
A
PERFECTLY
ACCEPTABLE
ANSWER
TO
HIS
OWN
QUESTION
DODD
MAY
HAVE
OFFERED
HIS
COPY
OF
THE
NAZI
WEAPONS
LAW
TO
SHOW
THAT
THE
SPECIFIC
PROPOSAL
DID
NOT
RESEMBLE
ANYTHING
IN
THE
NAZI
LAW
IN
FACT
SINCE
THE
LAW
AND
ITS
TRANSLATION
WERE
ENTERED
INTO
THE
CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD
UNDER
THE
HEADING
OF
DOCUMENTS
CONCERNING
THE
HISTORY
OF
NAZISM
AND
GUN
CONFISCATION
DODDS
MOTIVATION
ISNT
A
MYSTERY
HE
ASKED
FOR
THE
TRANSLATION
IN
ORDER
TO
PUT
IT
IN
THE
CR
EVEN
THIS
ARTICLE
MAKES
IT
CLEAR
THAT
THE
PART
OF
THE
NAZI
LAW
THAT
WAS
ADDED
BY
THE
NAZI
REGIME
IS
ONLY
A
SMALL
PART
OF
THAT
LAW
REGISTRATION
OF
GUNS
FOR
INSTANCE
WAS
BEGUN
IN
AND
THUS
NOT
A
NAZIINSPIRED
IDEA
THE
PARTS
OF
THE
NAZI
LAW
THAT
PARALLEL
THE
GCA
INCLUDE
HANDGUN
CONTROL
OF
SOME
SORT
AND
THE
IDENTIFICATION
OF
CERTAIN
WEAPONS
AS
SPORTING
WEAPONS
THE
JPFO
THEN
GOES
ON
TO
LIST
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
NAZI
LAW
FORBIDDING
OWNERSHIP
OF
WEAPONS
BY
JEWS
OF
COURSE
THERE
ARE
NO
SUCH
PROVISIONS
IN
THE
AMERICAN
GCA
NEVERTHELESS
IN
A
RHETORICAL
MOVE
GUARANTEED
TO
MUDDY
THE
WATERS
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
ANTIJEWISH
PARTS
OF
THE
LAW
THE
JPFO
ARTICLE
CONTINUES
GIVEN
THE
PARALLELS
BETWEEN
THE
NAZI
WEAPONS
LAW
AND
THE
SO
AS
TO
GET
MAXIMUM
EMOTIONAL
MILEAGE
