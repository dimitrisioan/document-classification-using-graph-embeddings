my
gun
is

andy
freeman
says
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang
members
and
not
undercover
cops
or
even
lawabiding
menacing
minorities
btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
we
know
because
the
area
that
the
gun
shopshooting
range
is
in
is
right
on
the
border
of
the
west
side
of
chicago
that
is
a
gang
infested
area
there
are
many
many
bad
things
going
on
in
that
area
also
i
have
several
friends
that
live
very
close
to
that
area
who
have
had
problems
with
some
of
these
folks
by
the
way
where
did
i
say
that
they
were
minorities
do
you
think
that
only
minorities
have
gangs
not
so
as
far
as
the
quotes
are
concerned
it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing
for
marksmanship
i
dont
know
about
you
but
i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
if
you
would
have
been
there
andy
it
wouldve
been
obvious
to
you
too
of
course
it
might
not
have
been
who
knows
all
i
do
know
is
that
i
was
there
i
live
here
and
i
know
that
they
were
gang
bangers
when
you
live
here
long
enough
it
becomes
pretty
easy
to
spot
them
via
gang
colors
gang
signs
etc
one
last
thing
my
sister
is
a
social
worker
she
makes
it
her
point
to
find
these
things
out
gang
signs
colors
etc
because
it
is
in
her
best
interest
to
do
so
she
is
nice
enough
to
let
me
know
these
things
so
i
can
watch
out
for
myself
as
i
live
right
on
the
border
of
the
west
side
of
the
city
enough
