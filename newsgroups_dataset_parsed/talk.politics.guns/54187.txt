RE
MY

IS

WRITES
DRIVERS
LICENCE
FORGOT
THAT
USA
IS
THE
LAND
OF
CARS
GETTING
ONE
IN
SCANDINAVIA
AND
NORTHERN
EUROPE
IS
NOT
EASY
AVERAGE
TIME
IS
ABOUT
HOURS
OF
TRAINING
AND
THE
COST
IS
RATHER
IS
THE
LICENSE
REQUIRED
FOR
DRIVING
A
CAR
EXCLUSIVELY
ON
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
SUCH
AS
A
FARM
HERE
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
THE
LICENSE
IS
REQUIRED
ONLY
FOR
THE
USE
OF
PUBLIC
ROADS
ABUSE
BY
THE
GOVERMENT
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MAIN
PROBLEMS
ANY
HARDER
GUNCONTROL
WOULD
JUST
BE
ABUSED
BY
THE
GOVERMENT
EITHER
SOME
OF
YOU
ARE
A
LITTLE
PARANOID
NO
OFFENCE
OR
YOU
SHOULD
GET
A
NEW
GOVERMENT
YOU
DO
HAVE
ELECTIONS
WE
ALSO
HAVE
A
NATION
OF
MILLION
PEOPLE
MANY
ISSUES
AND
USUALLY
ONLY
TWO
CANDIDATES
FOR
A
GIVEN
OFFICE
A
PRESIDENT
MIGHT
BE
WILLING
TO
ABUSE
MILD
GUN
CONTROL
LAWS
AND
CREATE
A
DEFACTO
BAN
SOMETHING
A
MAJORITY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WOULD
OBJECT
TO
AND
STILL
BE
ELECTED
THE
VOTERS
MIGHT
LOOK
AT
ISSUES
LIKE
THE
CIVIL
RIGHTS
OF
MINORITIES
HEALTH
CARE
ETC
AND
VOTE
FOR
THE
LESSER
OF
TWO
EVILS
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
A
MATTER
OF
PARANOIA
SINCE
LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
IN
FOR
EXAMPLE
NEW
YORK
AND
CHICAGO
HAVE
ABUSED
EXISTING
MILD
GUN
CONTROL
LAWS
TO
CREATE
A
VIRTUAL
BAN
GUNS
N
CRIMINALS
MOST
WEAPONS
USED
BY
CRIMINALS
TODAY
ARE
STOLEN
KNOWN
CRIMINALS
CAN
NOT
BUY
WEAPONS
THATS
ONE
OF
THE
POINTS
OF
GUN
CONTROL
IN
WHICH
CASE
THE
UNITED
STATES
ALREADY
HAS
ADAQUATE
GUN
CONTROL
LAWS
ACCORDING
TO
FEDERAL
STATISTIC
ONLY
OF
GUNWIELDING
CRIMINALS
LEGALLY
PURCHASE
THEIR
OWN
GUNS
FROM
LICENSED
DEALERS
IF
THATS
THE
POINT
OF
GUN
CONTROL
TO
PREVENT
CRIMINALS
FROM
LEGALLY
PURCHASING
GUNS
THEN
AMERICA
DOESNT
NEED
ANY
ADDITIONAL
LAWS
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THIS
MIXING
WEAPONS
AND
THINGS
THAT
CAN
BE
USE
AS
ONE
WHAT
I
MEANT
WAS
THAT
CARS
CAN
KILL
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
GUNS
HOW
IS
THIS
ANY
DIFFERENT
FROM
GUNS
THERE
ARE
LEGAL
PURPOSES
FOR
OWNING
AND
USING
A
GUN
THEY
ARE
APPROPRIATE
TOOLS
FOR
HUNTING
TARGET
SHOOTING
AND
SELFDEFENCE
LIKE
CARS
MURDER
ISNT
THEIR
ONLY
OR
EVEN
A
COMMON
USE
IF
OF
ALL
MURDERS
WAS
DONE
WITH
AXES
WOULD
YOU
IMPOSE
SOME
REGULATIONS
ON
THEM
OR
JUST
SAY
THAT
THEY
ARE
MENT
TO
BE
USED
AT
TREES
AND
THAT
THE
AXE
IS
NOT
A
PROBLEM
ITS
THE
AXER
I
CERTAINLY
COULDNT
IMAGINE
THE
AMERICAN
PUBLIC
ACCEPTING
REGULATION
OF
AXES
WHILE
THE
POLITICS
OF
OTHER
NATIONS
MAY
BE
DIFFERENT
IN
AMERICA
THERE
IS
STRONG
OPPOSITION
TO
ANY
INTRUSIVE
LAW
THAT
PRIMARILY
WOULD
EFFECT
THE
AVERAGE
LAWABIDING
CITIZEN
WHO
HAD
NOT
DONE
ANYTHING
WRONG
THINK
ABOUT
THE
SITUATION
IN
LOS
ANGELES
WHERE
PEOPLE
ARE
BUYING
GUNS
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES
IS
THIS
A
GOOD
SITUATION
IS
IT
THE
RIGTH
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
PROBLEM
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
WHICH
PROBLEM
IT
IS
AN
EXCELENT
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
SHORTTERM
PROBLEM
OF
RIOTING
AND
VIOLENT
ATTACKS
OF
COURSE
IT
DOESNT
DO
ANYTHING
FOR
THE
LONGTERM
ISSUES
THAT
START
RIOTS
BUT
AT
THIS
POINT
WHAT
CAN
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
DO
ABOUT
LONGTERM
SOCIAL
PROBLEMS
IF
EVERYBODY
BUYS
GUNS
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES
FROM
CRIMINALS
AND
THEIR
NEIGHBOR
WHO
HAVE
GUNS
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
WILL
HAPPEN
I
MEAN
IF
EVERYBODY
HAD
A
GUN
IN
USA
THERE
ARE
ACCORDING
TO
SURVEYS
GUNS
IN
OF
AMERICAN
HOMES
IN
MANY
PARTS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
THIS
IS
CLOSER
TO
THOSE
PLACES
WHERE
ALMOST
EVERYONE
OWNS
A
GUN
ARE
ON
AVERAGE
SAFER
THAN
THOSE
WHERE
GUNS
ARE
LESS
COMMON
LAST
WORD
RESPONSIBLE
GUN
OWNERS
ARE
NOT
A
PROBLEM
BUT
THEY
WILL
BE
AFFECTED
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
PROTECT
YOUR
CITICENS
THIS
IS
I
THINK
A
FUNDAMENTAL
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT
AND
THAT
OF
OTHER
NATIONS
HERE
IT
IS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
TO
PUNISH
OR
RESTRICT
THE
AVERAGE
LAWABIDING
CITIZEN
IN
THE
NAME
OF
SOME
VAGUE
COMMON
