CSCNTEAR
GAS
WHEN
I
RECEIVED
MY
INITIAL
INTRODUCTION
TO
TEAR
GAS
THE
FIRST
THING
THAT
CAME
TO
MIND
WAS
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
EXIT
IF
THERE
HAD
BEEN
ANYTHING
IN
THE
WAY
CORNERS
TO
NEGOTIATE
DOORS
TO
OPEN
OR
ANY
OTHER
OBSTACLES
TO
MOVEMENT
I
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
A
DIFFICULT
TIME
EXITING
YOU
COULDNT
FIND
A
WINDOW
AFTER

HOURS

OF
THE
PEOPLE
COULDNT
FIND
THE
WINDOW
AFTER
SIX
MINUTES
ASK
ANYBODY
WHOS
TAKEN
BASIC
TRAINING
IN
THE
MILITARY
IT
IS
NOT
AT
ALL
UNCOMMON
FOR
A
FEW
SOLDIERS
WHO
HAVE
NOT
PROPERLY
ATTACHED
AND
CLEARED
THEIR
MASKS
TO
REQUIRE
ASSISTANCE
EXITING
THE
CHAMBER
SINCE
THAT
CHAMBER
HAS
A
DOOR
NOT
JUST
A
WINDOW
ITS
LIKELY
A
HELL
OF
A
LOT
EASIER
TO
EXIT
THAN
A
MULTIROOM
