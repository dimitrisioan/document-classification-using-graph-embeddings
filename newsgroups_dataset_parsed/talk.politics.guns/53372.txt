i
would
be
surprised
if
there
werent
contrary
studies
i
might
add
that
sloan
and
kellerman
was
endorsed
by
the
police
departments
of
both
seattle
and
vancouver
and
is
considered
by
most
of
the
references
i
have
at
hand
the
most
exhaustive
study
of
its
kind
even
by
those
who
take
issue
with
some
of
the
essays
conclusions
sks
statistics
speak
largely
for
themselves
without
postulate
and
i
might
add
vitamin
c
has
been
endorsed
by
a
nobel
laureate
as
a
panacea
for
almost
everything
from
the
common
cold
to
cancer
in
order
to
compare
violent
crime
trends
sk
compared
all
violent
crime
categories
from
simple
assault
through
various
mechanisms
of
homicide
wait
a
minute
sk
did
not
compare
trends
if
they
did
they
would
have
seen
that
the
advent
of
canadas
gun
law
had
no
effect
on
homicides
total
or
handgun
without
a
pre
vs
post
comparison
one
cannot
speculate
as
to
the
utility
of
anything
all
they
have
is
a
correlation
and
correlation
does
not
prove
causality
if
your
point
is
that
nonwhites
commit
more
handgun
crimes
than
whites
then
yours
is
the
dubious
assumption
conventional
social
theory
is
that
economic
status
not
color
is
the
primary
motivating
factor
for
crime
especially
violent
crime
whats
your
point
anyway
that
white
people
are
more
responsible
gun
owners
should
we
assume
that
its
a
coincidence
that
there
are
comparitively
fewer
white
people
earning
below
the
poverty
line
and
living
in
tenement
neighborhoods
where
most
violent
crime
occurs
hold
it
again
you
dismiss
a
point
about
demographics
then
you
ask
about
socioeconomic
demographics
very
slick
differences
between
the
two
cities
in
the
permit
regulations
render
these
two
numbers
strictly
noncomparable
on
the
contrary
its
these
differences
that
are
the
very
basis
of
the
study
the
easy
availability
of
legal
handguns
in
seattle
and
the
much
more
difficult
restrictedweapons
permit
required
in
vancouver
once
again
correlation
does
not
prove
causality
looking
at
prevs
post
data
the
canadian
gun
law
had
no
effect
not
so
cook
measures
suicides
and
assaultive
homicides
with
firearms
against
a
surveybased
estimate
of
the
number
of
legal
and
illegal
guns
in
circulation
within
a
city
sir
if
you
were
a
canadian
and
owned
a
gun
before
the
restrictive
gun
laws
were
passed
and
decided
to
hide
it
rather
than
turn
it
in
would
you
answer
truthfully
a
question
about
gun
ownership
from
someone
who
calls
writes
or
asks
you
on
the
street
that
is
one
problem
with
surveys
nobody
will
answer
an
incriminating
question
another
is
that
people
will
often
tell
you
what
they
think
you
want
to
here
again
your
author
misses
the
core
issue
that
vancouver
citizens
are
prohibited
from
purchasing
handguns
on
the
basis
of
selfdefense
they
dont
have
a
choice
in
the
matter
does
that
mean
no
vancouver
citizens
have
handguns
i
think
not
you
are
discounting
guns
purchased
beforehand
and
guns
purchased
for
purposes
other
than
selfdefense
which
can
also
be
used
for
defense
hmmm
sounds
like
your
author
might
like
a
bumper
sticker
that
reads
guns
dont
kill
people
black
people
kill
people
honestly
his
conjectures
backed
up
by
zero
evidence
zero
studies
and
even
less
common
sense
arent
worth
the
considerable
time
it
must
have
taken
you
to
type
in
his
assumptions
look
frighteningly
close
to
those
pseudoscientific
studies
that
the
white
supremist
assholes
love
the
crap
that
takes
published
statistics
twisted
around
in
an
attempt
to
prove
the
inherent
criminal
nature
of
black
people
he
makes
valid
points
about
demographic
differences
you
then
resort
to
the
kind
of
argument
that
the
politically
correct
movement
often
uses
to
stifle
any
debate
nice
real
nice
this
authors
essay
contains
independent
study
upon
which
to
base
his
conclusions
just
some
strained
disjointed
statistical
discourse
attempting
to
blame
seattles
murder
rate
on
blacks
one
doesnt
have
to
produce
his
own
data
in
order
to
point
out
the
flaws
in
the
methodology
and
conclusions
of
anothers
study
again
you
resort
to
pc
tactics
