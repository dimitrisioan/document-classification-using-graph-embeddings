i
was
under
the
impression
that
to
obtain
fissionable
materials
ie
plutonium
or
reactorweaponsgrade
uranium
one
was
required
to
obtain
a
federal
permit
to
own
such
materials
no
you
merely
have
to
start
working
on
yellowcake
or
else
devise
a
system
to
get
it
from
other
sources
btw
the
doe
handles
reactor
fuel
and
merely
leases
it
to
reactors
the
nrc
certifies
these
reactors
the
military
have
their
own
sources
a
private
citizen
has
none
of
these
official
sources
actually
why
bother
looking
it
up
from
the
material
we
covered
last
term
in
weeks
of
gech
nuclear
chemistry
i
could
derive
what
it
would
take
to
build
a
bomb
thats
freshmanlevel
chemistry
big
deal
can
you
make
it
work
thats
phdlevel
physics
big
difference
and
as
far
as
the
explosive
charge
i
as
a
chemist
could
synthesize
a
variety
of
explosives
from
commonly
available
chemicals
in
the
garage
if
i
felt
like
the
electronics
behind
the
detonator
and
the
shaped
charges
are
a
little
trickier
however
but
not
impossible
using
a
few
tricks
of
the
trade
and
if
i
really
wanted
to
be
nasty
i
could
include
a
core
of
hydrogen
and
deuterium
so
you
admit
that
theres
no
law
that
could
stop
you
physics
aside
could
you
make
one
if
you
had
the
funds
and
time
the
answer
is
yes
so
do
we
lock
you
up
now
because
of
this
surely
you
can
see
where
the
comparison
with
antigun
laws
comes
into
play
here
of
course
the
hardest
part
is
getting
the
fissionable
material
to
start
with
and
living
long
enough
to
put
a
bomb
together
plutonium
has
some
nasty
properties
precisely
why
its
not
as
readily
utilized
as
you
seem
to
have
been
lead
to
believe
btw
is
far
better
for
homemade
bombs
than
trying
to
use
plutonium
the
laws
of
physics
make
the
creation
of
a
device
without
serious
manufacturing
facilities
very
low
in
probability
