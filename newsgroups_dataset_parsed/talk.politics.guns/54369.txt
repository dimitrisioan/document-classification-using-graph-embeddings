WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WACO
IS
NOT
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
BATF
IF
THEY
WOULD
OF
HAD
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PERSONAL
THEN
THEY
COULD
OF
CAPTURED
THE
COMPOUND
ON
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
AND
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
OF
HAPPENED
INITIAL
ASSAULT
ON
THE
COMPOUND
MORE
LIKE
A
WOODEN
FARM
HOUSE
IF
IT
BURNED
TO
THE
GROUND
LIKE
IT
DID
FOR
WHAT
REGARDLESS
OF
WHO
STARTEDCAUSED
THE
FIRE
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
IF
THE

CAN
HONESTLY
JUSTIFY
THEIR
INITIAL
ASSAULT
AND
HANDLED
IT
PROPERLY
QUESTION

SNIP
WITH
THE
WOD
AND
THE
INCREASED
CRIME
IN
THE
STREETS
THE
BATF
IS
NEEDED
MORE

THEN
EVER
IF
THEY
BLAST
AWAY
A
FEW
GOOD
FOKES

THAT
IS
THE
PRICE
WE
ALL
HAVE
TO
PAY

AT
ALL
THE
GOOD
PEOPLE
THAT
DIED
IN

TO
PROTECT
THIS
GREAT
COUNTRY
OF
OURS
WITH
THE
ARMS
BUILD
UP
IN
WACO
THEY
NEEDED
TO
HIT
THAT
COMPOUND
WITH
SHOW

SOME
EVIDENENCE
INSTEAD
OF

TOLD
YOU
MEGA
FIRE
POWER
THEY
COULD
OF
GONE
IN
THERE
BLASTING
AND
KILLED
A
FEW
WOMEN
AND
KIDS
BUT
IT
WOULD
OF
BEEN
BETTER
THEN
LETTING
THEM
ALL
BURN
TO
DEATH
DAYS
LATER
THEN
IM
SURE
YOU
WONT
MIND
IF
THE
ATF
OR
THE
DEA
RAID
YOUR

SOMEDAY
ON
A
BOGUS
INFORMANT
TIP
