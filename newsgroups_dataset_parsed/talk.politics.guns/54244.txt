responded
by
email
to
a

terminator
began
posting
only
six
months
before
he
purchased
his
first
firearm
according
to
private
email
from
him
i
cant
produce
an
archived
posting
of
his
earlier
than
january
and
he
purchased
his
first
firearm
in
march
i
guess
it
only
seemed
like
years
back
to
your
regularly
scheduled
flame

the
only
thing
necessary
for
the
triumph
of
evil
is
for
good
men
to
do
nothing
