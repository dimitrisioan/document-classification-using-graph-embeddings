i
think
ill
quote
the
bbc
quoting
actually
voice
interview
one
of
the
two
british
survivors
he
claimed
that
the
fire
started
when
the
tanks
caused
an
internal
wooden
wallroof
to
collapse
knocking
over
kerosene
lamps
and
that
they
had
no
suicide
plan
if
the
fbi
started
the
fire
why
didnt
people
flee
the
burning
building
assuming
the
fire
was
caused
by
lanterns
and
stoves
being
knocked
about
by
the
tanks
pushing
on
the
walls
would
shake
a
building
pretty
good
perhaps
they
didnt
flee
because
fleeing
would
have
meant
entering
the
fire
from
the
other
side
like
they
were
surrounded
by
the
fire
and
rubble
which
finally
combined
with
teargas
and
combustion
gasses
overcame
and
enveloped
them
in
other
words
they
were
trapped
by
the
flames
heat
fumes
and
rubble
does
that
sound
plausable
not
as
dramatic
as
korash
forcing
them
to
stay
or
shooting
them
no
shot
victims
found
yet
