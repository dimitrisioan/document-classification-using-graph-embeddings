what
relevance
are
all
homicides
in
this
debate
what
do
you
think
gun
control
advocates
are
saying
that
if
we
get
rid
of
all
handguns
we
will
live
in
a
homicidefree
world
they
sure
make
it
sound
like
that
the
issue
is
guns
not
baseball
bats
even
a
simpleton
knows
that
he
stands
a
better
chance
of
surviving
an
attack
with
a
baseball
bat
certainly
of
outrunning
a
batwielding
assailant
even
a
simpleton
knows
a
baseball
bat
is
considered
a
deadly
weapon
if
one
cannot
run
away
eg
old
infirm
even
middleaged
if
the
assailant
is
younger
a
handgun
is
the
most
effective
means
of
defense
you
wont
even
have
to
fire
a
shot
of
the
time
as
for
knives
see
my
earlier
post
id
much
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
thanks
fortunately
the
best
defense
against
a
knife
isnt
another
knife
anyone
trained
in
unarmed
selfdefense
wont
have
much
of
a
problem
disarming
a
knife
assailant
untrained
in
knife
assault
which
probably
means
of
knife
assailants
any
real
streetfighter
and
there
are
lots
of
them
with
or
without
a
knife
will
kick
the
living
sh
out
of
most
people
trained
in
unarmed
self
defense
for
the
majority
of
people
a
gun
is
the
most
effective
form
of
self
defense
