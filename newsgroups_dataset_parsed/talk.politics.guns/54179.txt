I
ANNALS

AT

WHAT
SIR
IS
THE
USE
OF
A
MILITIA
IT
IS
TO
PREVENT
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
STANDING
ARMY
THE
BANE
OF
LIBERTY
WHENEVER
GOVERNMENTS
MEAN
TO
INVADE
THE
RIGHTS
AND
LIBERTIES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THEY
ALWAYS
ATTEMPT
TO
DESTROY
THE
MILITIA
IN

TO
RAISE
AN

UPON

MEANS

FIND
SO

IS
HOW

SOME

GO

REDEFINITIONS
REINTERPRETATIONS
IN
A
FULLBORE
ATTEMPT
TO
THROW

ALMOST
MAKES
ME
THINK
OF

I
REALLY
WONDER
THAT
JEFFERSON
AND
MADISON
WOULD
SAY
TO
THESE
FOLKS
WHEN
ALL
GOVERNMENT
IN
LITTLE
AS
IN
GREAT
THINGS
SHALL
BE
DRAWN
TO
WASHINGTON
AS
THE
CENTRE
OF
ALL
POWER
IT
WILL
RENDER
POWERLESS
THE
CHECKS
PROVIDED
OF
ONE
GOVERNMENT
ON
ANOTHER
AND
WILL
BECOME
AS
VENAL
AND
OPPRESSIVE
AS
THE
GOVERNMENT
FROM
