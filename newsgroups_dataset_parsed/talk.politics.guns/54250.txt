RE
WITH
FRIENDS
LIKE
THESE
L
NEIL
SMITH
LOOK
IF
YOU
CAN
FIGURE
OUT
A
RELIABLE
MEANS
OF
KEEPING
GUNS
AWAY
FROM
BAD
PEOPLE
WHILE
NOT
INTERFERING
WITH
GOOD
PEOPLE
I
THINK
WED
ALL
BE
FOR
IT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
METHODS
WERE
USING
NOW
DONT
DO
THE
TRICK
DONT
MANUFACTURE
THEM
DONT
SELL
THEM
DONT
IMPORT
THEM
SOME
GUNS
WILL
GET
THROUGH
BUT
FAR
FEWER
AND
FAR
LESS
PEOPLE
WILL
DIE
BECAUSE
OF
THEM
HUNTING
WEAPONS
COULD
BE
ALLOWED
OF
COURSE
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
ARE
BIG
AND
BULKY
AND
REQUIRE
RELOADING
AFTER
A
FEW
SHOTS
HOW
MANY
TIMES
CAN
YOU
SHOOT
AT
THE
SAME
ANIMAL
ANYWAYS
ONE
ASSUMES
THEY
ARE
MOVING
A
BETTER
SOLUTION
IF
THE
BAD
PEOPLE
CANT
BE
TRUSTED
WITH
GUNS
THEN
LOCK
THEM
OR
KNOCK
THEM
OFF
STOP
PUNISHING
GOOD
PEOPLE
