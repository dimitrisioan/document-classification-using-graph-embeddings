ITS

ALSO
BANNED
BY
A
THE
REASON

WAS
THAT
THE

CAUSES
EXTREME
NAUSEA
BLINDNESS
DISORIENTATION
TOTAL
IRRATIONALITY
RAGING
PARANOIA
CHILDREN

BE
ALL
THE
MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE
AND
SHOW
THE
RESULTS
ALL
THE
EARLIER
IF

A
NAUSEA
GAS
AND
DOESNT
HAVE

CNS
EFFECTS
HOWEVER
ITS
QUITE
BADMUCH
WORSE
THAN

I
WAS
BRIEFLY
EXPOSED
TO
IT

DURING
AN
ENGAGEMENT
IN
BERKELEY

WAS
PAINFUL

MY
ENTIRE

PERSISTED
FOR
HOURS
AFTER

IF
I
WAS
EXPOSED
TO
A
DENSE
CONCENTRATION
OF
THIS
STUFF
IN
A
CLOSED
SPACE
FOR
SEVERAL
HOURS
I
DOUBT
WHETHER

COULD
FIND
THE
EXIT
INDEED
I
CANT
IMAGINE
