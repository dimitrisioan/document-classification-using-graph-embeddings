re
nature
of
the
waco
gas
in

writes
just
heard
on
the
network
radio
news
a
spokesman
from
the
army
saying
that
the
type
of
cs
gas
used
in
waco
had
been
banned
from
military
use
its
use
is
also
banned
by
a
the
reason
given
was
that
the
use
causes
extreme
nausea
blindness
disorientation
total
irrationality
raging
paranoia
children
would
be
all
the
more
susceptible
and
show
the
results
all
the
earlier
if
we
are
indeed
talking
about
cs
then
this
is
not
quite
accurate
cs
is
just
tear
gasalbeit
the
worst
kind
it
isnt
a
nausea
gas
and
doesnt
have
direct
cns
effects
however
its
quite
badmuch
worse
than
cn
gas
i
was
briefly
exposed
to
it
once
during
an
engagement
in
berkeley
circa
and
its
not
the
kind
of
thing
you
forget
it
seems
to
be
moistureactivatedit
not
only
made
my
eyes
sting
and
water
but
attacked
my
breathing
passages
and
lungs
breathing
was
painful
and
my
entire
face
felt
as
if
it
was
on
fire
these
effects
persisted
for
hours
after
exposure
and
i
was
coughing
for
days
afterwards
if
i
was
exposed
to
a
dense
concentration
of
this
stuff
in
a
closed
space
for
several
hours
i
doubt
whether
i
could
find
the
exit
indeed
i
cant
imagine
living
through
it
