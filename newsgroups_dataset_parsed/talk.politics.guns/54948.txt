HAS
ANYONE
IN
US
HEARD
ANYTHING
SIMILAR
OR
ARE
US
GOVERNMENT
SPINDOCTORS
CENSORING
SUCH
INFORMATION
THE
BBC
NEWS
IS
ALSO
REPORTING
THAT
ABOUT
OF
THOSE
THAT
DIED
WERE
BRITISH
CITIZENS
THE
BBC
ARE
ALSO
REPORTING
THAT
BODIES
OF
BD
MEMBERS
WERE
FOUND
WITH
BULLET
WOUNDS
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
SUGGESTS
THEY
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
SHOT
ATTEMPTING
TO
LEAVE
THE
COMPOUND
DURING
THE
FIRE
THERE
IS
A
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THESE
ARE
THE
BODIES
OF
PEOPLE
KILLED
DURING
THE
INITIAL
SHOOTOUT
PHILL
HALLAMBAKER
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
A
MAGAZINE
EXPLODES
BULLETS
GO
FLYING
EVERY
WHERE
IMHO
THESE
GUNSHOT
WOUNDS
WERE
ACTUALLY
CAUSED
WHEN
THE
MAGAZINES
WENT
UP
A
TEXAS
RANGER
DOES
NOT
A
PATHOLOGIST
MAKE
SO
ILL
WAIT
FOR
AN
AUTOPSY
TO
DETERMINE
IF
THEY
WERE
SHOT
FIRST
I
WOULD
DOUBT
BULLETS
WOULD
GO
FLYING
THERE
IS
NO
PARTICULAR
FORCE
TO
MAKE
THE
BULLET
LEAVE
THE
SCENE
OF
A
CARTRIDGE
GOING
OFF
OUTSIDE
OF
A
BARREL
THE
BRASS
SHELL
WOULD
BURST
TOO
SOON
TO
GIVE
THE
BULLET
ANY
REAL
VELOCITY
I
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
BE
NEAR
IT
BUT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
BULLET
WOUNDS
WOULD
RESULT
SHRAPNEL
WOUNDS
WOULD
BE
MORE
LIKELY
AT
LEAST
THIS
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
NOT
NECESSARILY
IF
THE
BODY
HAD
BEEN
DENATURED
COOKED
OR
DEHYDRATED
DUE
TO
THE
HEAT
A
PROJECTILE
NEEDS
ONLY
A
MINIMAL
KINETIC
FORCE
TO
PENETRATE
IN
FIRE
AFTERMATHS
BODIES
TEND
TO
FALL
APART
OR
LOOSE
LARGE
CHUNKS
OF
MEAT
WITH
LITTLE
EFFORT
MEDICAL
EXAMINERS
TEND
NOT
TO
LIKE
CLEANING
UP
SUCH
SCENES
AS
SUCH
IF
THE
BODY
HAD
BEEN
SUITABLY
COOKED
A
BULLET
COMMING
FROM
A
MAGAZINE
EXPLOSION
WOULD
MORE
THAN
LIKELY
HAVE
ENOUGH
FORCE
TO
ENTER
AND
THUS
IT
WOULD
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
A
BULLET
ENTERED
AT
THE
TIME
OF
DEATH
OR
MUCH
LATER
UNLESS
YOU
WERE
TRAINED
TO
LOOK
FOR
THE
EVIDENCE
TEXAS
RANGERS
ARE
NOT
PATHOLOGISTS
EITHER
WAY
THEYRE
ALL
DEAD
AND
THE
FBI
ATTY
GEN
VAMPRIA
ARE
STILL
RESPONSABLE
