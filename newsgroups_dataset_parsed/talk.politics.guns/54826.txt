FORGOT
TO
LEAVE
IN
HIS
QUOTE
SOURCE
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WACO
IS
NOT
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
BATF
IF
THEY
WOULD
OF
HAD
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PERSONAL
THEN
THEY
COULD
OF
CAPTURED
THE
COMPOUND
ON
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
AND
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
OF
HAPPENED
THE
BATF
IS
A
PART
OF
THE
DEPT
OF
TREASURY
NOT
JUSTICE
IF
THEY
NEEDED
TO
ASSAULT
A
PLACE
THEY
COULD
JUST
DO
LIKE
THE
IRS
DOESCALL
IN
THE
FEDERAL
MARSHALLS
SERVICE
THEIR
FUGITIVE
COLLECTION
TEAMS
DO
SIMILAR
TYPE
ASSAULTS
ALL
THE
TIME
AND
THEY
ARE
VERY
VERY
GOOD
ABOUT
IT
IN
BOTH
THE
TACTICAL
AND
LEGAL
PARTS
OF
IT
BUT
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
MARSHALLS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
TOUCHED
IT
BECAUSE
THE
SEARCH
WARRANT
WHICH
IS
STILL
SEALED
I
BELIEVE
WAS
SO
BOGUS
BESIDES
THE
BATF
ALSO
COULD
HAVE
GOTTON
SWAT
TEAMS
FROM
FEDERAL
MARSHALLS
SERVICE
FBI
SECRET
SERVICE
NATIONAL
PARK
SERVICE
TEXAS
RANGERS
NEARBY
LARGE
CITY
POLICE
FORCES
THE
MILITARY
BUT
THEY
HAD
TO
USE
THEIR
OWN
GUYS
NOBODY
ELSES
SWAT
TEAM
WAS
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
HOLY
CAUSE
OF
GUN
CONTROL
I
ALSO
FIND
THE
TIMING
OF
THE
RAID
TO
BE
EXTREMELY
INTERESTING
INITIAL
RAID
TWO
DAYS

THEIR

CONFISCATION

I
DONT

IN

I
DONT
