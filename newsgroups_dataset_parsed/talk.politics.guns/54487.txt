RE
SOME
MORE
ABOUT
GUN
CONTROL
FIRST
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SAY
HOW
MUCH
I
APPRECIATE
HAVING
SO
LITERATE
AND
ERUDITE
AN
INDIVIDUAL
AS
MR
RUTLEDGE
WITH
WHOM
TO
DISCUSS
THIS
TOPIC
FRANKLY
MOST
ANTIRKBA
POSTERS
REFUSE
EVEN
TO
APPROACH
THE
TOPIC
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
AS
DETAILED
IN
THE
WRITINGS
OF
THE
ERA
THIS
IS
MOST
REFRESHING
SECOND
I
MUST
APOLOGIZE
FOR
LEAVING
THE
DISCUSSION
FOR
SEVERAL
DAYS
MY
BRIGADES
QUARTERLY
DRILL
WAS
THIS
WEEKEND
AND
I
NEEDED
TO
ATTEND
TO
SEVERAL
MATTERS
PERTAINING
TO
THE
STATE
MILITIA
SOME
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
FEEL
THAT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
THE
MILITIA
IS
AN
ANACHRO
NISM
THAT
IS
OUT
OF
PLACE
IN
THE
CENTURY
IM
NOT
SURE
THE
SWISS
WOULD
AGREE
AND
I
THINK
PERHAPS
A
DISCUSSION
OF
HOW
THE
MILITIA
BOTH
ORGANIZED
AND
UNORGANIZED
FITS
INTO
THE
DEFENSE
PLANS
OF
MY
STATE
MISSISSIPPI
PLEASE
DO
NOT
ASSUME
THAT
THIS
DESCRIBES
SOMETHING
PECULIAR
TO
ONE
SOUTHERN
STATE
FOR
INSTANCE
THE
COMMONWEALTH
OF
MASSACHUSETTS
HAS
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
WHICH
MEMBERS
REPORT
MAINTAINS
STOCKS
OF
BOTH
RIOT
GUNS
AND
MACHINE
GUNS
THE
LAWS
OF
OTHER
STATES
WILL
VARY
BUT
ARE
PROBABLY
SIMILAR
TITLE
OF
MISSISSIPPI
CODE
DEFINES
OUR
MILITIA
AS
ALL
ABLEBODIED
CITIZENS
OF
THE
STATE
BETWEEN
THE
AGES
OF
SEVENTEEN
AND
SIXTY
TWO
YEARS
THE
MILITIA
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
CLASSES
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
THE
MISSISSIPPI
STATE
GUARD
AND
THE
UNORGANIZED
MILITIA
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
IS
A
STRANGE
SORT
OF
FISH
FROM
A
CONSTITUTIONAL
PERSPECTIVE
IT
TRIES
TO
BE
BOTH
STATE
MILITIA
AND
FEDERAL
RESERVE
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
THIS
PARACONSTITUTIONAL
ARRANGEMENT
IS
QUITE
INTERESTING
IN
ITSELF
BUT
SOMEWHAT
BEYOND
THE
SCOPE
OF
THIS
DISCUSSION
SUFFICE
IT
THAT
AT
THIS
DATE
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
HAS
CEASED
TO
HAVE
ANY
CONSTITUTIONAL
STANDING
AS
ANYTHING
BUT
A
FEDERAL
RESERVE
FORCE
MISSISSIPPI
AND
MOST
OTHER
STATES
MAINTAINS
A
PURELY
STATE
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
IN
MISSISSIPPI
THIS
IS
CALLED
THE
STATE
GUARD
IN
OTHER
STATES
IT
MAY
BE
CALLED
SOMETHING
ELSE
THE
STATE
GUARD
EXISTS
AS
A
CADRE
OR
TRAINING
CORPS
MADE
UP
OF
MOSTLY
EXPERIENCED
OFFICERS
AND
SENIOR
NCOS
WHO
SERVE
AS
VOLUNTEERS
WITHOUT
COMPENSATION
WE
DRILL
ON
A
MONTHLY
BASIS
AT
THE
COMPANY
AND
BATTALION
LEVEL
BRIGADE
ONCE
A
QUARTER
AND
HAVE
AN
ANNUAL
DRILL
OF
THE
WHOLE
ORGANIZATION
OUR
STATEAUTHORIZED
CADRE
STRENGTH
IS
THIS
IS
A
SKELETON
OF
AN
ORGANIZATION
WITHOUT
ANY
FLESH
THE
MUSCLE
AND
SINEW
WHEN
NEEDED
WILL
COME
FROM
THE
UNORGANIZED
MILITIA
IN
TIME
OF
INVASION
INSURRECTION
OR
CALAMITY
THE
GOVERNOR
CAN
ORDER
THE
ACTIVATION
OF
THE
STATE
GUARD
WHEN
THIS
TAKES
PLACE
A
CALL
WILL
FIRST
BE
MADE
FOR
VOLUNTEERS
TO
FILL
THE
ORGANIZATION
OUT
TO
EITHER
ITS
CONTINGENCY
STRENGTH
OF
OR
FULL
STRENGTH
OF
IN
THE
EVENT
THAT
A
SUFFICIENT
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
FAIL
TO
VOLUNTEER
THE
LAW
PROVIDES
DETAILED
INSTRUCTIONS
FOR
THE
CONDUCTING
OF
A
DRAFT
OF
THE
UNORGANIZED
MILITIA
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
STATE
GUARD
IS
NOT
SPECIFIED
BY
LAW
BUT
RATHER
BY
EXECUTIVE
ORDER
AT
ONE
TIME
THE
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
OF
MISSISSIPPI
CONSISTED
OF
REGIMENTS
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THE
STATE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ARMORIES
BRIMMING
WITH
WEAPONS
WITH
WHICH
TO
EQUIP
SUCH
A
FORCE
THE
HISTORICAL
PRECEDENT
FOR
ARMING
SUCH
A
FORCE
IS
BY
USE
OF
MOSTLY
THE
PRIVATE
ARMS
OF
THE
MILITIAMEN
IT
IS
MY
HOPE
THAT
DEMONSTRATES
THAT
STATE
MILITIAS
ARE
FAR
FROM
BEING
THE
LONG
DEAD
ANACHRONISMS
THAT
SOME
MAY
WISH
TO
CLAIM
NO
I
SIMPLE
STATED
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
JOIN
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
AND
I
HAVE
ALSO
STATED
THAT
A
MILITIA
THAT
MEETS
ONCE
OR
TWICE
A
YEAR
IS
CLEARLY
WELL
ORGANIZED
AND
THIS
STATE
OF
READINESS
THAT
I
HAVE
CLAIMED
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
IS
THE
SAME
STATE
OF
READINESS
EXPECTED
OF
THE
MILITIA
AS
STATED
BY
HAMILTON
REGARDING
HAMILTON
IF
YOU
TAKE
HAMILTONS
OPINION
AS
BEING
THE
SOLE
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
THE
OPINIONS
OF
THE
FOUNDING
FATHERS
YOU
WILL
HAVE
CHOSEN
A
HIGHLY
SKEWED
SAMPLE
SET
HAMILTON
WAS
ON
THE
EXTREME
FEDERALIST
END
OF
THE
POLITICAL
SPECTRUM
OTHERS
SUCH
AS
COXE
AND
HENRY
CAN
BE
CHOSEN
TO
REPRESENT
THE
OTHER
END
MANY
CONTEMPORARIES
FELT
THAT
THE
IDEA
OF
HAVING
A
STANDING
ARMY
OF
ANY
SORT
OR
EVEN
A
SELECT
MILITIA
OR
TRAIN
BANDS
WERE
CONTRARY
TO
THE
EGALITARIAN
NATURE
OF
THE
GOVERN
MENT
THEY
WERE
STRIVING
TO
PERFECT
THE
COMPROMISE
REACHED
WAS
TO
PROVIDE
FOR
A
SMALL
ARMY
WHICH
HAD
TO
BE
REFINANCED
EVERY
TWO
YEARS
AND
IRONCLAD
PROTECTION
FOR
THE
MILITIA
WHICH
WAS
TO
REMAIN
EVER
TERRIBLE
AND
IRRESISTIBLE
THESE
PROTECTIONS
INCLUDED
STATE
CONTROL
NOT
FEDERAL
LIMITATION
OF
FEDERAL
UTILIZATION
OF
THE
MILITIA
IE
EXECUTE
LAWS
SUPPRESS
INSURRECTIONS
AND
REPEL
INVASIONS
AND
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
TO
PREVENT
WHAT
THE
BRITISH
HAD
TRIED
TO
DO
AT
LEXINGTON
THESE
LIMITATIONS
EVENTUALLY
PROVED
SO
ONEROUS
TO
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERN
MENT
THAT
THEY
WERE
SKIRTED
BY
THE
CREATION
OF
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
WAS
CREATED
FOR
ONE
VERY
SIMPLE
REASON
THE
CONSTITUTIONAL
MILITIA
WAS
HAD
PROVED
TOO
UNRELIABLE
FOR
FIGHTING
WARS
OF
IMPERIAL
EXPANSION
EG
SPANISHAMERICAN
WAR
THE
CONSTITUTION
PROVIDED
THAT
THE
MILITIA
COULD
ONLY
BE
EMPLOYED
BY
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IN
VERY
LIMITED
PURPOSES
AS
FAR
BACK
AS
THE
WAR
OF
MILITIA
UNITS
HAD
REFUSED
TO
LEAVE
UNITED
STATES
TERRITORY
TO
ATTACK
THE
ENEMY
FURTHER
THERE
WAS
NO
CONSTITUTIONAL
AUTHORIZATION
FOR
ANY
CONSCRIPTION
OF
ANYONE
INTO
THE
FEDERAL
MILITARY
AND
MILITIAMEN
WERE
PARTICULARLY
PROTECTED
IN
ALL
WARS
UNTIL
WWI
EVERY
AMERICAN
WHO
LEFT
THE
COUNTRY
UNDER
ARMS
WAS
A
VOLUNTEER
WHEN
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
ACTS
OF
REQUIRED
THAT
EACH
NEW
MEMBER
ALSO
ENLIST
AS
A
RESERVEST
IN
THE
ARMY
EXISTING
SOLDIERS
WERE
GRANDFATHERED
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THESE
GRANDFATHERED
INDIVIDUALS
REFUSED
TO
GO
TO
FRANCE
IN
AND
HIS
REFUSAL
WAS
UPHELD
BY
THE
FEDERAL
COURTS
MR
RUTLEDGE
HAS
STATED
THAT
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
APPLIES
ONLY
TO
MEMBERS
OF
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
HOWEVER
THE
PRECONSTITUTIONAL
HISTORY
OF
THE
AMERICAN
MILITIA
SHOWS
RELATIVELY
FEW
PERIODS
WHEN
THE
MILITIA
CAME
CLOSE
TO
MEETING
EITHER
MESSRS
RUTLEDGE
OR
HAMILTONS
DEFINITION
OF
WELL
ORGANIZED
IN
THE
PERIOD
OF
PEACE
BETWEEN
THE
FRENCH
INDIAN
WAR
AND
THE
REVOLUTION
MANY
COMPANIES
SIMPLY
STOPPED
DRILLING
AND
HAD
TO
BE
RECONSTITUTED
JUST
PRIOR
TO
THE
REVOLUTION
PERHAPS
MR
RUTLEDGE
WOULD
CARE
TO
ARGUE
THAT
THOSE
OF
MY
ANCESTORS
WHO
ANSWERED
THE
LEXINGTON
ALARM
HAD
FORFEITED
THEIR
RIGHTS
BECAUSE
THEIR
UNITS
DIDNT
DRILL
FOR
A
FEW
YEARS
IN
THE
I
WOULD
NOT
BE
SO
BOLD
AGAIN
I
WISH
TO
REPEAT
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
FOR
ALL
ITS
MERITS
IS
NOT
THE
MILITIA
DESCRIBED
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
NOR
BY
MR
HAMILTON
NOR
BY
MR
HENRY
NOR
BY
MR
COXE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
AND
MANY
STATES
ARE
DELINQUENT
IN
THEIR
ATTENTIONS
TO
AND
ORGANIZING
OF
THEIR
CONSTITUTIONAL
MILITIAS
DIMINISHES
NEITHER
THEIR
RESPONSIBILITIES
NOR
THE
RIGHTS
OF
THE
MILITIA
AS
DETAILED
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
MISUNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
NATURE
AND
PURPOSE
OF
THE
MILITIA
IS
BUT
ONE
ERROR
THAT
HAS
CREPT
INTO
MODERN
READINGS
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
THE
CONSTITUTION
PROHIBITS
STATES
FROM
KEEPING
TROOPS
OR
SHIPS
OF
WAR
IN
TIME
OF
PEACE
I
HAVE
HEARD
SOME
INSIST
THIS
PREVENTS
STATES
FROM
MAINTAINING
A
MILITIA
BUT
THIS
COMES
ABOUT
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
TODAY
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
THE
MEANINGS
OF
THE
WORDS
IN
THEIR
CENTURY
USAGE
TODAY
WE
CALL
ANY
LARGE
VESSEL
A
SHIP
BUT
IN
THE
CENTURY
THE
WORD
DESCRIBED
A
PARTICULAR
KIND
OF
VESSEL
A
SHIP
IS
A
LARGE
VESSEL
WITH
THREE
OR
MORE
MASTS
EACH
CARRYING
SQUARE
RIGGED
SAILS
A
BRIG
HAS
TWO
MASTS
IN
THE
CONTEMPORARY
USAGE
THE
STATES
WERE
PROHIBITED
ONLY
FROM
KEEPING
THE
LARGEST
WARSHIPS
OF
THE
DAY
THOSE
CAPABLE
OF
GLOBAL
OPERATIONS
TODAYS
EQUIVALENT
MIGHT
BE
A
PROHIBITION
ON
THE
STATES
KEEPING
NUCLEAR
MISSILES
TROOPS
AT
THIS
TIME
MEANT
A
FULLTIME
PROFESSIONAL
MILITARY
ORGANIZATION
ANY
STUDY
OF
CONTEMPORANEOUS
WRITINGS
WILL
BEAR
THIS
OUT
IN
AT

ONE
RESPECT
I
AM
IN

WITH
MR

BEING
PERSONALLY
INVOLVED
IN
THE
MAINTENANCE
AND
ADVANCEMENT
OF
THE
MILITIA
AS
