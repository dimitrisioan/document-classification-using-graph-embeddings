id
appreciate
any
help
anyone
could
give
me
on
these
two
questions
the
brady
bill
was
in
the
news
throughout
but
what
actually
happened
to
it
in
congress
did
bush
veto
it
if
so
when
the
brady
bill
passed
the
house
in
but
failed
to
reach
a
vote
in
the
senate
as
such
it
never
reached
bush
sarah
bradys
condemnation
notwithstanding
i
have
a
joint
housesenate
conference
committe
report
ie
crime
bill
for
the
congress
which
contains
a
brady
bill
day
waiting
period
within
it
i
believe
it
just
died
and
never
came
up
for
a
vote
in
either
house
itll
probably
pass
the
house
again
and
will
probably
pass
the
senate
if
they
can
get
it
to
a
vote
whether
of
not
theyll
be
busy
with
other
things
will
be
the
question
they
got
four
years
of
clintons
support
to
pass
it
