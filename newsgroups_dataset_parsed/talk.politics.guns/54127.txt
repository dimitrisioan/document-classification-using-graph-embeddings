RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE
DAVID
VEAL
SAYS
STUFF
DELETED
ME
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
HAPPENING
HERE
IS
THE
SITUATION
GETTING
TOTALLY
BLOWN
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
IN
MY
POST
I
WAS
REFERRING
TO
YOUR
REGULAR
PATROLMAN
IN
A
CAR
CRUISING
AROUND
THE
CITY
VS
GANG
MEMBERS
OF
COURSE
THE
POLICE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
THINGS
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
BUT
DO
THEY
USE
TANKS
AND
SUCH
ALL
OF
THE
TIME
OF
COURSE
THEY
DONT
AND
THATS
THE
POINT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
EVERY
DAY
WHEN
I
GO
OUT
TO
LUNCH
I
ALWAYS
SEE
COPS
COMING
IN
THE
MAJORITY
THAT
I
SEE
ARE
STILL
CARRYING
REVOLVERS
NOT
THAT
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
WRONG
WITH
A
REVOLVER
BUT
IF
YOURE
A
COP
THAT
IS
UP
AGAINST
SOME
GANG
MEMBER
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
AUTOMATICS
IN
HIS
COAT
I
MEAN
SEMIAUTO
HANDGUNS
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
EVEN
WITH
TRAINING
DAVID
THIS
IS
THE
ARMS
RACE
FALLACY
THAT
SOMEHOW
BIGGER
GUNS
MAKE
AN
INDIVIDUAL
SAFER
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
FOR
EACH
CORRESPONDING
LEVEL
OF
OFFENSIVE
POWER
THE
IS
NOT
AN
AUTOMATIC
LEVEL
OF
DEFENSE
INCREASE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THERES
A
SORT
OF
LETHALITY
THRESHOLD
THAT
ONCE
YOU
GET
PAST
YOURE
ONLY
TALKING
ABOUT
A
METTER
OF
DEGREE
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
COPS
ARE
UP
AGAINST
THERES
REALLY
NO
REASON
FOR
THE
AVERAGE
BEAT
COP
TO
HAVE
ANYTHING
BIGGER
THAN
A
PISTOL
ON
HIM
AS
A
PERSONAL
WEAPON
AND
MAYBE
A
RIFLE
AND
A
SHOTGUN
IN
THE
CRUISER
I
MEAN
THINK
ABOUT
IT
CARRYING
A
MONSTER
PISTOL
OR
SUBMACHINEGUN
DOESNT
MAKE
THE
COP
ANY
LESS
WOUNDED
IF
SOMEBODY
SHOOTS
HIM
A
LOT
OF
POLICE
DEPARTENMENTS
HAVE
SWITCHED
TO
SEMIAUTOMATICS
AS
BETTER
MORE
RELIABLE
WEAPONS
AND
MORE
STOPPING
POWER
BUT
THERES
A
POINT
OF
DIMINISHING
RETURNS
THIS
IS
A
VERY
VERY
GOOD
POINT
WHO
CARES
WHAT
KIND
OF
GUN
YOUVE
GOT
IF
YOURE
LYING
ON
THE
GROUND
DEAD
AND
AS
FAR
AS
AUTOMATICS
GO
ANY
GANG
MEMBER
CARRYING
AROUND
A
COUPLE
OF
AUTOMATICS
AN
INCREDIBLE
RARITY
IS
GOING
TO
BE
FAR
MORE
OF
A
MENACE
TO
HIMSELF
AND
INNOCENT
BYSTANDERS
THAN
ANYTHING
HE
MIGHT
BE
TRYINH
TO
AIM
AT
ONE
AUTO
IS
HARD
ENOUGH
TO
CONTROL
ANYBODY
WHO
COULD
CONTROL
TWO
IS
GOING
TO
GET
THE
POLICE
OFFICER
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
THE
POLICE
OFFICER
IS
ARMED
WITH
MORE
STUFF
DELETED
MOSTLY
MINE
MY
QUESTION
IS
THIS
WHAT
WOULD
A
POLICE
OFFICER
GAIN
FROM
HAVING
A
SUBMACHINEGUN
OR
SIMILAR
PERSONAL
WEAPON
THAT
HE
ALREADY
DOESNT
HAVE
WITH
A
OR
SEMIAUTOMATIC
PISTOL
I
DONT
SEE
AS
HOW
THE
POLICE
SHOULD
BE
HOSING
AROUND
FULLAUTO
FIRE
NOR
HAS
MY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
POLICE
OFFICERS
OR
THE
STATS
REGARDING
HOW
MANY
POLICE
OFFICERS
GET
KILLED
BY
OTHER
COPS
MADE
ME
FEEL
SUCH
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
IDEA
PRECISE
FIRE
IS
FAR
MORE
PREFERABLE
NOR
SHOULD
THEY
USING
BIGGER
GUNS
MOST
STANDARD
SIDEARMS
HAVE
MORE
THEN
SUFFICIENT
STOPPING
POWER
WHEN
PROPERLY
APPLIED
ALL
MORE
POWERFUL
WEAPONS
WOULD
DO
IS
MAKE
THE
LIKELIHOOD
OF
DEATH
HIGHER
WITHOUT
REALLY
GIVING
POLICE
SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE
OPTIONS
ANOTHER
VERY
GOOD
POINT
THAT
IS
WELL
TAKEN
IT
SEEMS
THAT
WHEN
LOTS
OF
LEAD
IS
FLYING
EITHER
THE
COPS
OR
THE
GANGS
SOMEONE
INNOCENT
ALWAYS
GETS
CAUGHT
IN
THE
CROSSFIRE
DAVID
VEAL
UNIV
OF
TENN
DIV
OF
CONT
EDUCATION
INFO
SERVICES
GROUP
I
STILL
REMEMBER
THE
WAY
YOU
LAUGHED
THE
DAY
YOUR
PUSHED
ME
DOWN
THE
ELEVATOR
SHAFT
IM
BEGINNING
TO
THINK
YOU
DONT
LOVE
ME
ANYMORE
WEIRD
AL
ALL
POINTS
MADE
ABOVE
ARE
WELL
TAKEN
I
GUESS
I
AM
IN
THE
MINDSET
OF
HAVING
MORE
MAKES
IT
BETTER
WHICH
IS
OBVIOUSLY
NOT
THE
CORRECT
MINDSET
TO
TAKE
IN
THIS
DISCUSSION
NOW
THAT
I
THINK
ABOUT
THE
SITUATION
A
LITTLE
MORE
CAREFULLY
I
SEE
YOUR
POINT
EXACTLY
DAVID
AND
I
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
SP
AGREE
LIKE
I
SAID
IM
JUST
ASSUMING
THAT
MORE
BULLETS
ANDOR
BIGGER
BULLETS
IS
BETTER
ONCE
AGAIN
THOUGH
I
WANT
TO
STATE
THAT
I
AM
A
PROGUN
INDIVIDUAL
AND
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
GUN
CONTROL
IS
REALLY
A
VIABLE
OPTION
HERE
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
DRIVEL
THAT
I
SPOUT
HERE
