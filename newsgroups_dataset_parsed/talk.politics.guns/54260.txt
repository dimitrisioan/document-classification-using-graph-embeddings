RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
I
HATE
LONG
POSTINGS
BUT
THIS
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
RATHER
LENGTHY
OVERALL
CRIME
RATE
IT
FELLJUST
LIKE
THAT
ACQUIRING
WEAPONS
IN
NORWAY
YOU
CAN
BUY
ALMOST
ALL
KINDS
OF
WEAPONS
IN
NORWAY
BUT
YOU
MUST
HAVE
A
PERMIT
AND
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
GET
THE
PERMIT
IF
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HAVE
A
HANDGUN
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GET
AN
GUNLICENCE
FROM
THE
POLICE
AND
TO
BE
A
MEMBER
OF
A
GUNCLUB
THE
POLICE
WOULD
CHECK
MY
CRIMINAL
RECORDS
FOR
ANY
SERIOUS
CRIMES
ANDOR
RECORDS
OF
SERIOUS
MENTAL
DISEASES
NOW
IF
A
GOT
MY
LICENCE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
AN
ACTIVE
MEMBER
OF
THE
GUN
CLUB
FOR
MONTHS
BEFORE
I
COULD
COLLECT
MY
GUN
ITS
A
LITTLE
LIKE
GETTING
A
DRIVERS
LICENCE
ISNT
IT
YOU
HAVE
TO
PROVE
THAT
YOU
CAN
DRIVE
BEFORE
YOU
ARE
ALLOWED
TO
USE
OF
GUNS
IN
CRIMES
IN
NORWAY
SOME
CRIMES
ARE
COMMITED
WITH
GUNS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
IN
THE
OWNERS
ARMS
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BUT
THESE
ARE
RATHER
THE
EXEPTION
MOST
CRIMINALS
ACCUIRE
GUNS
TO
USE
THEM
IN
CRIMES
AND
MOSTLY
SHORT
TIME
BEFOR
THE
CRIME
USE
OF
KNIVES
IT
IS
ALLOWED
TO
CARY
KNIFES
IN
PUBLIC
BUT
NOT
IN
YOUR
BELT
OR
OPEN
YOU
AMERICANS
THINK
ITS
OK
TO
HAVE
A
GUN
BUT
NOT
TO
CARRY
IT
OPEN
IN
PUBLIC
RIGTH
SCANDINAVIANS
ARE
AGGRESSIVE
WE
NORTHENERS
ARE
NOT
AS
HOTLIVERED
AS
SOUTHENERS
BUT
WHEN
WE
DECIDE
TO
TAKE
ACTION
WE
DO
ASK
ANY
HISTORIAN
OR
MILLITARY
WITH
AN
KNOWLEDGE
OF
EUROPE
OR
ASK
ANY
GERMAN
WHO
SERVED
IN
NORWAY
IN
INDIVIDUAL
VS
MASSES
YES
THE
INDIVIDUAL
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
THE
MASSES
BUT
ONLY
TO
SOME
EXTENT
YOUR
CRIMINAL
LAWS
ARE
TO
PROTECT
THE
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
MAKES
THE
MASSES
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
THE
RIGTHS
OF
SOME
INDIVIDUALS
AFFECTS
THE
RIGHTS
OF
ALL
THE
OTHERS
THE
ISSUE
I
BELIEVE
THE
ISSUE
IS
GUNS
AND
GUNLEGISLATION
WE
SHOULDNT
MIX
WEAPONS
AND
ITEMS
THAT
CAN
SERVE
AS
ONE
IF
I
LIVED
IN
AMERIKA
I
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
A
GUN
TO
DEFEND
MYSELFE
IN
HOME
BUT
SHOULD
IT
HAVE
TO
BE
LIKE
THAT
DO
YOU
THINK
ITS
WISE
TO
SELL
GUNS
LIKE
CANDY
SOME
STATES
DO
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
ITS
SMARTNECCACERY
TO
HAVE
DRIVERSLICENCE
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
IT
SHOULD
BE
FREE
TO
BUY
GUNS
DISCLAIMHER
IM
NOT
A
PACIFIST
OR
ANTI
GUN
I
WOULD
DEFEND
MY
HOME
LOVED
ONES
AND
COUNTRY
BUT
I
DONT
VIEW
GUNS
AS
NECCITIES
OR
TOYS
I
HAVE
DONE
ARMY
SERVICE
AND
HAVE
USED
A
VARIATY
OF
WEAPONS
BUT
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
HAVE
ONE
FOR
SELF
DEFENCE
OR
BECAUSE
THEY
FEEL
GOOD
THIS
IS
NOT
A
SIGNATURE
ITS
MARLY
A
COMPUTERGENERATED
TEXT
TO
WASTE
BANDWITH
AND
TO
BRING
DOWN
THE
EVIL
INTERNET
