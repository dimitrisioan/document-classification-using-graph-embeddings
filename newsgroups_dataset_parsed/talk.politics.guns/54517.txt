i
just
got
through
listening
to
the
oclock
news
on
channel
here
in
dallas
they
trotted
out
a
list
of
justifications
produced
by
the
atf
after
months
of
investigation
for
their
raid
cnn
just
claimed
he
bought
semiautomatic
assault
rifles
and
they
say
koresh
wasnt
godlike
he
managed
to
buy
or
build
a
collection
of
fullyautomatic
semiautomatic
rifles
quite
a
feat
i
would
say
theyre
still
making
charges
of
sexual
abuse
and
such
or
course
nobody
seems
to
have
noticed
that
the
treasury
department
has
nothing
to
do
with
sex
crimes
or
maybe
the
feds
have
recently
instituted
a
tax
on
sex
crimes
yeah
thats
why
the
batf
was
there
looking
for
unregistered
guns
this
is
my
weapon
this
is
my
gun
this
is
for
fighting
this
is
for
i
couldnt
believe
the
junk
on
this
list
for
example
the
bds
were
accused
of
stockpiling
a
bunch
of
and
ammunition
that
can
be
used
in
and
assault
rifles
imagine
thatthey
had
ammunition
i
also
heard
that
theyre
claiming
to
be
cautious
because
of
koreshs
heated
ammunition
stockpile
i
seem
to
recall
that
smokeless
powder
tends
to
decompose
at
even
moderate
temperatures
i
would
be
rather
surprised
after
a
fire
of
that
nature
if
any
of
his
stockpile
is
unexploded
or
unburned
they
also
had
aluminum
dust
yeah
its
a
component
of
thermite
but
so
far
i
havent
heard
that
its
illegal
to
take
a
grinder
to
the
aluminum
lawn
furniture
i
seem
to
recall
that
aluminum
powder
is
a
common
component
of
fireworks
the
folks
on
recpyro
could
probably
tell
you
the
only
thing
on
the
list
that
could
conceivably
have
been
illegal
was
an
grenade
launcher
anybody
know
about
this
i
think
anything
is
legal
if
you
have
the
proper
license
if
he
had
a
curios
and
relics
permit
i
believe
he
could
legally
own
handgrenades
to
go
with
his
launcher

it
