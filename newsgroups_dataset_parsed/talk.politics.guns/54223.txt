yea
there
are
millions
of
cases
where
yoy
say
that
firearms
deter
criminals
alas
this
is
not
provable
i
think
that
that
there
are
actually
few
cases
where
this
is
so
you
think
wrong
ask
the
fbi
theyve
got
the
proof
look
it
up
the
bulk
of
firarems
are
used
against
unworthy
and
unnesessary
opponents
those
who
posessa
a
cool
jakcet
you
want
those
who
would
argue
with
you
about
a
parking
space
those
who
would
take
your
woman
in
short
trivial
and
worthless
causes
you
lie
like
a
snake
the
vast
majority
of
the
million
firearms
in
this
country
are
never
used
in
anger
your
feelings
notwithstanding
too
much
of
this
has
ruined
you
cause
there
is
no
recovery
in
the
near
future
federal
martials
will
come
for
your
arms
no
one
will
help
you
you
are
more
dangerous
to
their
thinking
than
the
criminal
this
is
your
own
fault
we
will
overcome
the
kind
of
blind
pigheaded
utterly
stupid
idiocy
that
you
and
others
spout
in
a
vain
attempt
to
further
your
own
agendas
we
will
make
the
truth
be
known
despite
your
best
efforts
to
the
contrary
the
amendment
is
dead
accept
this
find
another
way
the
second
amendment
wont
be
dead
unless
it
is
repealed
that
wont
happen
ever
accept
this
find
another
way
to
try
and
control
others
lives
because
we
see
you
for
what
you
are
and
we
are
not
fooled
