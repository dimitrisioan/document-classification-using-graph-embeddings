sorry
guy
you
got
it
wrong
atf
was
pumping
tear
gas
into
the
compound
the
branch
davidians
going
along
with
their
apocolyptic
faith
set
their
own
compound
on
fire
killing
all
but
or
so
no
children
survived
seeing
as
how
people
are
willing
to
quote
the
fbi
quoting
cultists
who
just
yesterday
were
deranged
and
not
to
be
trusted
hmm
the
fbi
or
the
cultists
i
think
ill
quote
the
bbc
quoting
actually
voice
interview
one
of
the
two
british
survivors
he
claimed
that
the
fire
started
when
the
tanks
caused
an
internal
wooden
wallroof
to
collapse
knocking
over
kerosene
lamps
and
that
they
had
no
suicide
plan
maybe
true
partly
true
or
false
