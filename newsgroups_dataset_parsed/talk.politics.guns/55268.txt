i
really

clearly
it
was
a

according

fierce
gun
battles
erupted
sunday
as
more
than
law
officers
tried
to
arrest
the
leader
of
a
heavily
armed
religious
cult
at
least
four
federal
agents
and
two
cult
members
were
reported
killed
the
gun
battles
began
when
federal
agents
hidden
in
livestock
trailers
stormed
the

headquarters
sunday
morning
witnesses
said
the

had
warrants
to
search
for
guns
and
explosives

witnesses

the

stormed

main

throwing
concussion
grenades
and
screaming
come
out
while
three
national

helicopters
approached
for
a
moment
there
was
no
response
then
the
shooting
began
i
think
storming
the
sects
headquaters
and
throwing
concussion
grenades
qualifies
as
a
noknock
or
perhaps
an
illegal
assault
he
was
not
just
another
guy
minding
his
own
business
hell
give
them
all
the
guns
in
the
world
if
they
dont
bother
anyone
but
he
was
a
scary
sort
dont
you
think
the
sort
of
person
youd
want
your
daughter
to
date
i
probably
not
but
then
again
neither
are
you
then
he
fired
on
the
atf
thats
not
just
a
little
mistake
or
some

that
shit
doesnt
fly
anyone
with

that
will
shoot
and
kill
and
just
what
is
his
background
what
prior
crimes
had
he
been
convicted
of
federal

enforcement

is
not
some

the
people
cannot
be
all
and
always
well
informed
the
part
which
is
wrong
will
be
discontented
in
proportion
to
the
importance
of
the
facts
they
misconceive
if
they
remain
quiet
under
such
misconceptions
it
is
lethargy
the
forerunner
of
death
