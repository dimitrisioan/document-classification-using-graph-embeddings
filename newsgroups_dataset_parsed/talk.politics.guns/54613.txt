MEWHY
ARE
THEY
FINDING
DEAD
BODIES
INSIDE
WHO
HAD
BULLET
HOLES
ALREADY
IN
THEM
DONT
YOU
THINK
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
KORESH
SHOT
THE
TRAITORS
RATHER
THAN
LETTING
THEM
OUT
POSSIBLE
I
WOULDNT
PUT
IT
PAST
HIM
IT
IS
ALSO
POSSIBLE
THAT
THEY
WERE
HIT
BY
ROUNDS
EXPLODING
IN
THE
EXTREME
HEAT
REMEMBER
THAT
KEPT
THE
COPS
AWAY
FOR
HOURS
I
HAVE
ONLY
HEARD
THAT
BODIES
WERE
FOUND
SHOT
NOT
ANY
CORONERS
CAUSE
OF
DEATH
SO
FAR
THE
MEDICAL
EXAMINER
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NEWS
HAS
FOUND
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
GUNSHOT
WOUNDS
IN
BODIES
SO
FAR
EXAMINED
IF
THIS
CONTINUES
TO
BE
THE
CASE
IT
WILL
SORT
OF
SHOOT

PUN
INTENDED
IN
THE
FBI
STORY
WOULDNT
IT
AND
CARTRIDGES
GOING
OFF
OUTSIDE
A
FIREARM
DO
NOT
LAUNCH
A
BULLET
LIKE
THEY
DO
WHEN
FIRED
FROM
A
GUN
THE
BULLET
HARDLY
MOVES
IT
IS
THE
BRASS
CASING
THAT
GOES
FLYING
AND
THEN
WITH
LESS
THAN
LETHAL
FORCE
IT
WILL
HURT
YES
BUT
NOT
KILL
YOU
I
DOUBT
IF
IT
WIL
PENETRATE
A
COAT
FOR
EXAMPLE
HOW
ABOUT
AN
INDEPENDENT
INVESTIGATION
WITH
FULL
SUBPOENA
POWERS
AND
POWERS
TO
PROSECUTE
ON
FELONY
CHARGES
TO
INVESTIGATE
FOR
ANY
POSSIBLE
ILLEGALCRIMINAL
ACTIVITY
ON
THE
PART
OF
BOTH
THE
BATF
AND
FBI
I
CANNOT
SEE
ANY
REASON
WHY
NOT
TO
USE
THE
PHRASE
THEY
LIKE
TO
USE
SO
OFTEN
IF
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
HIDE
THEY
SHOULD
WELCOME
IT
AND
VIGOROUSLY
SUPPORT
IT
NOTE
THAT
AN
INTERNAL
INVESTIGATION
BY
THE
DEPT
OF

IS
NOT
AN
