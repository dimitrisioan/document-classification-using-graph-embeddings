THE
POLYMATH
WRITES
THE
POSSESSION
OF
NUCLEAR
ARMS
ACTUALLY
WEAPONS
GRADE
FISSIONABLES
IS
CURRENTLY
REGULATED
ONLY
BY
MARKET
FORCES
IE
TO
OWN
THEM
YOU
HAVE
TO
EITHER
MAKE
THEM
BUY
THEM
OR
STEAL
THEM
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
STOPS
YOU
IS
THE
STAGGERING
COST
MORE
THAN
MOST
NATIONS
CAN
AFFORD
THE
FACT
THAT
NO
ONE
WHO
HAS
THEM
WANTS
TO
SELL
TO
YOU
AND
THE
TIGHT
SECURITY
MAINTAINED
ON
EXISTING
STOCKS
JUST
ASK
SADDAM
HUSSEIN
I
WAS
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
TO
OBTAIN
FISSIONABLE
MATERIALS
IE
PLUTONIUM
OR
REACTORWEAPONSGRADE
URANIUM
ONE
WAS
REQUIRED
TO
OBTAIN
A
FEDERAL
PERMIT
TO
OWN
SUCH
MATERIALS
GIVEN
A
SOURCE
OF
FISSIONABLES
YOU
CAN
BUILD
A
BOMB
IN
YOUR
GARAGE
WITH
PARTS
FROM
HARDWARE
STORES
AND
ELECTRONIC
JUNK
SUPPLIES
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
ENGAGE
IN
SOME
SHADY
DEALINGS
TO
GET
THE
EXPLOSIVE
CHARGE
BUT
THATS
TRIVIAL
COMPARED
TO
GETTING
THE
PLUTONIUM
THE
BASIC
INFORMATION
ON
THE
DESIGN
WAS
DECLASSIFIED
YEARS
AGO
AND
CAN
BE
DUG
OUT
OF
ANY
TECHNICAL
LIBRARY
BY
A
PHYSICS
GRAD
STUDENT
ACTUALLY
WHY
BOTHER
LOOKING
IT
UP
FROM
THE
MATERIAL
WE
COVERED
LAST
TERM
IN
WEEKS
OF
GECH
NUCLEAR
CHEMISTRY
I
COULD
DERIVE
WHAT
IT
WOULD
TAKE
TO
BUILD
A
BOMB
AND
AS
FAR
AS
THE
EXPLOSIVE
CHARGE
I
AS
A
CHEMIST
COULD
SYNTHESIZE
A
VARIETY
OF
EXPLOSIVES
FROM
COMMONLY
AVAILABLE
CHEMICALS
IN
THE
GARAGE
IF
I
FELT
LIKE
THE
ELECTRONICS
BEHIND
THE
DETONATOR
AND
THE
SHAPED
CHARGES
ARE
A
LITTLE
TRICKIER
HOWEVER
BUT
NOT
IMPOSSIBLE
USING
A
FEW
TRICKS
OF
THE
TRADE
AND
IF
I
REALLY
WANTED
TO
BE
NASTY
I
COULD
INCLUDE
A
CORE
OF
HYDROGEN
AND
DEUTERIUM
OF
COURSE
THE
HARDEST
PART
IS
GETTING
THE
FISSIONABLE
MATERIAL
TO
START
WITH
AND
LIVING
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
PUT
A
BOMB
TOGETHER
