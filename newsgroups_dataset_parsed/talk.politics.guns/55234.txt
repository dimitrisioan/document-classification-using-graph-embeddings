RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE
ANDYSAILSTANFORDEDU
ANDY
FREEMAN
SAYS
THIS
IS
WHERE
FREEMANS
LOVE
OF
ACCURACY
BECOMES
REALLY
RIDICULOUS
GOOD
NOW
LETS
LOOK
AT
THOSE
SECTIONS
THEYLL
PROVE
MY
POINT
HIS
POINT
WAS
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
UNDER
CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
FOR
MANY
PEOPLE
TO
CARRY
CONCEALED
IN
ILLINOIS
A
A
PERSON
COMMITS
THE
OFFENSE
OF
UNLAWFUL
USE
OF
WEAPONS
WHEN
HE
KNOWINGLY
CARRIES
OR
POSSESSES
IN
ANY
VEHICLE
OR
CONCEALED
ON
OR
ABOUT
HIS
PERSON
EXCEPT
WHEN
ON
HIS
LAND
OR
IN
HIS
OWN
ABODE
OR
FIXED
PLACE
OF
BUSINESS
ANY
PISTOL
REVOLVER
STUN
GUN
OR
TASER
OR
OTHER
FIREARM
NOTE
THAT
THIS
DOESNT
AFFECT
ALL
CONCEALED
CARRY
LOOK
AFTER
THE
WORD
EXCEPT
IT
ALWAYS
HELPS
TO
READ
THE
LAW
BEFORE
COMMENTING
ON
IT
I
DID
READ
THE
LAW
BEFORE
I
COMMENTED
ON
IT
JUDGING
FROM
REPLIES
I
RECEIVED
ABOUT
MY
SEMANTICS
ON
TPG
POST
MANY
IF
NOT
MOST
PEOPLE
HERE
ON
TPG
ASSUME
THAT
WHEN
CCW
LAWS
ARE
ASKED
ABOUT
THE
PERSON
IS
ASKING
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
AN
ORDINARY
CITIZEN
GETTING
ONE
IT
WOULD
ALSO
FOLLOW
THAT
SAID
PERSON
WOULD
GET
THE
CCW
TO
CARRY
ON
HISHER
PERSON
AWAY
FROM
THEIR
HOME
ANDOR
BUSINESS
WOULD
A
PRUDENT
STOREKEEPER
CARRY
CONCEALED
HOW
ABOUT
SOMEONE
AT
HOME
NOTE
THAT
BOTH
ARE
LEGAL
AND
A
LOT
OF
COMMON
PEOPLE
QUALIFY
FOR
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
ANDY
MAYBE
FREEMAN
DID
PROVE
HIS
POINT
BUT
HIS
POINT
IS
NOT
RELEVANT
THE
THING
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
CARE
ABOUT
WHEN
THEY
ASK
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
CARRYING
A
CONCEALED
WEAPON
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
CAN
CARRY
IT
CONCEALED
ON
THEIR
PERSON
WHEN
THEY
ARE
OUT
ON
THE
STREET
SOMEWHERE
IM
SURE
THAT
NOT
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
CONCERNED
WITH
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
CAN
CARRY
CONCEALED
AT
HOME
SPEAKING
AS
SOMEONE
WHO
LIVES
IN
ILLINOIS
THE
ONLY
PLACE
WHERE
THE
ABOVE
QUOTED
LAW
IS
RELEVANT
I
KNOW
THAT
IT
IS
LEGAL
TO
OWN
A
HANDGUN
HERE
I
AM
NOT
TAKING
INTO
ACCOUNT
CITY
ORDINANCES
I
COULD
CARE
LESS
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
I
CAN
CARRY
CONCEALED
AT
HOME
I
ONLY
CARE
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
I
CANT
CARRY
CONCEALED
IN
THE
PLACE
WHERE
IT
REALLY
COUNTS
OUT
ON
THE
STREET
FREEMAN
LOVES
TO
BE
ACCURATE
AND
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
THAT
ESPECIALLY
NOT
BUT
HE
SEEMS
TO
BE
FORGETTING
THAT
ACCURATE
FACTS
DONT
ALWAYS
REPLACE
COMMON
SENSE
I
AM
NOT
GOING
TO
FOLLOWUP
TO
THIS
THREAD
ANYMORE
BECAUSE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
USELESS
TO
ARGUE
THESE
POINTS
ANYMORE
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
IS
HAPPENING
NOW
IS
THAT
FREEMAN
AND
I
ARE
RUNNING
AROUND
IN
CIRCLES
TRYING
TO
PROVE
EACH
OTHER
WRONG
AND
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
TIME
TO
BE
PLAYING
GAMES
ANYMORE
OF
COURSE
NOW
FREEMAN
WILL
ATTACK
ME
ABOUT
MY
USE
OF
COMMON
SENSE
IN
SOME
OF
MY
EARLIER
POSTS
BUT
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
MY
ONLY
ADVICE
FOR
FREEMAN
QUIT
BEING
SO
PICKY
ABOUT
ACCURACY
SOMETIMES
AND
USE
YOUR
COMMON
SENSE
IT
REALLY
DOES
WORK
SOME
TIMES
JASON
