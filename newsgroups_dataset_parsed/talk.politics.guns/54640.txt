BILL
VOJAK
WRITES
BOTH
OF
MY
SENATORS
AND
MY
REP
I
ALSO
CALLED
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
COMMENT
LINE
WAS
ON
HOLD
FOR
MINUTES
SO
MAYBE
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
ARE
CALLING
PLEASE
CALL
YOUR
CONGRESS
CRITTERWH
COMMENT
LINE
NOW
JUST
A
GENERAL
NOTE
I
HAVE
SEEN
SEVERAL
POLLS
LATELY
AND
THEY
SHOW
A
LARGE
MAJORITY
A
THINKS
THAT
THIS
INCIDENT
WAS
HANDLED
OK
AND
B
THINKS
THAT
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
GAVE
THEM
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
TIME
DAYS
TO
COME
OUT
I
TAKE
IT
THAT
WHEN
SOMETHING
HAPPENS
THAT
IS
WRONG
ITS
OKAY
IF
A
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
SAY
IT
IS
FOR
INSTANCE
IF
SOME
PEOPLE
GO
ON
A
MURDEROUS
RAMPAGE
AND
LYNCH
SOME
BLACKS
AND
THEN
A
POLL
IS
TAKEN
WHICH
SHOWS
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
ACCEPTABLE
THEN
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
WHAT
THESE
PEOPLE
HAVE
DONE
ISNT
BAD
THIS
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
MOB
RULE
NOT
A
DEMOCRACYA
DEMOCRACY
IN
WHICH
PEOPLES
RIGHTS
ARE
PROTECTED
I
HOPE
THAT
IVE
MADE
MYSELF
CLEAR
ON
THIS
MAKE
THE
FOLLOWING
POINTS
YOUR
OUTRAGE
OVER
TODAYS
BEHAVIOUR
AND
WHAT
IF
IM
NOT
OUTRAGED
FINEYOU
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
HOLD
ANY
OPINION
THAT
YOU
WANT
TO
BUT
LET
ME
ASK
YOU
THIS
ARE
YOU
OUTRAGED
OVER
THIS
TRAGEDY
I
HOPE
THAT
YOU
ARE
YOUR
OPINIONS
OF
DAVID
KORESH
AND
HIS
FOLLOWERS
NOT
WITHSTANDING
I
KNOW
I
AM
SINCE
BATF
CHIEF
HIGGENS
AND
JANET
RENO
WERE
THE
WHO
SIGNED
OFF
ON
THIS
PLAN
DEMAND
THAT
THEY
BE
FIRED
ACTUALLY
THEY
SHOULD
BOTH
BE
COMMENDED
WHY
ID
BE
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
YOUR
REASONS
POINT
OUT
THAT
EVEN
IF
THE
FIRE
WAS
SET
BY
SOMEONE
INSIDE
OF
THE
BUILDING
IT
CAME
AS
A
DIRECT
RESULT
OF
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
FBIBATF
AND
THE
PEOPLE
INSIDE
INCLUDING
CHILDREN
DESERVED
A
TRIAL
INSTEAD
OF
THIS
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
IS
WHAT
EXACTLY
DID
YOU
EXPECT
THEM
TO
DO
I
CAN
SEE
IT
NOWTHE
OCLOCK
NEWS
FBI
AND
BATF
AGENTS
STILL
SURROUND
THE
WACO
COMPOUND
AFTER
DAYS
I
DONT
THINK
SO
THEY
GAVE
THEM
EVERY
CHANCE
THEY
HAD
DAYS
TO
SURRENDER
TO
PROPER
AUTHORITIES
THEY
HAD
ATTORNIES
REPRESENTING
THEM
ETC
KORESH
LIED
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
I
DONT
WISH
THEM
DEAD
BUT
YOU
CANT
LET
IT
STALEMATE
FOREVER
IT
WAS
TIME
TO
DO
SOMETHING
AND
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
DID
WHAT
HAPPENED
WAS
UNFORTUNATE
BUT
ACCEPTABLE
AS
LONG
AS
THE
FBI
DIDNT
SET
THE
FIRE
INTENTIONALLY
