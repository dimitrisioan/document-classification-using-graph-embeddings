VINCENTCADGATECHEDU
VINCENT
FOX
WRITES
IN
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
DELETED
AND
AS
FAR
AS
FULLYAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
YOU
CAN
BE
A
LOT
BETTER
ARMED
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
HIT
WHAT
YOU
AIM
AT
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
HAPPENING
HERE
IS
THE
SITUATION
GETTING
TOTALLY
BLOWN
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
IN
MY
POST
I
WAS
REFERRING
TO
YOUR
REGULAR
PATROLMAN
IN
A
CAR
CRUISING
AROUND
THE
CITY
VS
GANG
MEMBERS
OF
COURSE
THE
POLICE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
THINGS
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
BUT
DO
THEY
USE
TANKS
AND
SUCH
ALL
OF
THE
TIME
OF
COURSE
THEY
DONT
AND
THATS
THE
POINT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
EVERY
DAY
WHEN
I
GO
OUT
TO
LUNCH
I
ALWAYS
SEE
COPS
COMING
IN
THE
MAJORITY
THAT
I
SEE
ARE
STILL
CARRYING
REVOLVERS
NOT
THAT
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
WRONG
WITH
A
REVOLVER
BUT
IF
YOURE
A
COP
THAT
IS
UP
AGAINST
SOME
GANG
MEMBER
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
AUTOMATICS
IN
HIS
COAT
I
MEAN
SEMIAUTO
HANDGUNS
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
EVEN
WITH
TRAINING
I
HAVE
BEEN
AT
A
SHOOTING
RANGE
WHERE
GANG
GANG
MEMBERS
WERE
PRACTICING
SHOOTING
THEY
WERE
ACTUALLY
PRACTICING
TAKING
OUT
THEIR
GUNS
AS
QUICK
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
SHOOTING
AT
THE
TARGET
AND
THEY
WERENT
DOING
TOO
BADLY
EITHER
THE
UNIVERSITY
COPS
HERE
WHO
ARE
ARE
STATE
COPS
ARE
ARMED
BETTER
THAN
THE
CHICAGO
POLICE
IT
SEEMS
MOST
STATE
COPS
ARE
EVERY
CITY
AND
SUBURBAN
POLICE
OFFICER
IVE
SEEN
AROUND
THE
TWIN
CITIES
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
YEARS
HAS
CARRIED
A
SEMIAUTO
OF
SOME
TYPE
DIFFERENT
BRANDS
THOUGH
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANY
GLOCKS
WITH
REGARD
TO
THIS
DISCUSSION
WE
ARE
GETTING
DANGEROUSLY
FAR
FROM
THE
USUAL
RANTINGS
OF
TPG
AND
CLOSE
TO
THE
REALM
OF
RG
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
PUT
MY
TWO
CENTS
WORTH
IN
WHILE
THERES
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
A
REVOLVER
ESPECIALLY
A
LARGE
FRAME
SW
IN
MAGNUM
MY
FAVORITE
THERE
ARE
VALID
ADVANTAGES
TO
SEMIAUTOS
I
SUGGEST
READING
MASSAD
AYOOBS
I
KNOW
SOME
PEOPLE
CANT
STAND
HIM
AND
THINK
HES
FULL
OF
BULL
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
IN
GENERAL
HIS
MATERIAL
IS
VERY
VALID
AND
USEFUL
BOOK
THE
SEMI
AUTO
PISTOL
IN
POLICE
WORK
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
HE
DEFINES
A
NUMBER
OF
WAYS
THAT
SEMIAUTOS
ARE
DIFFERENT
AND
THAT
DIFFERENT
IS
GOOD
THE
MAIN
ADVANTAGE
IS
NOT
IN
INCREASED
FIREPOWER
BUT
IN
MORE
ACCURATE
FOLLOWUP
SHOTS
WHEN
YOU
GO
TO
SINGLE
ACTION
MODE
THERE
IS
ALSO
A
CERTAIN
PROPRIATORY
NATURE
OF
EACH
GUN
THAT
TAKES
SOME
FAMILIARITY
TO
LEARN
THIS
MAY
HAVE
DIMINISHED
WITH
TIME
AS
MORE
CRIMINALS
BECOME
FAMILIAR
WITH
DIFFERENT
MODELS
OF
SEMIAUTOS
BUT
IT
WAS
CITED
AS
STOPPING
OR
AT
LEAST
SLOWING
DOWN
CRIMINALS
WHO
HAD
GRABBED
A
POLICE
OFFICERS
GUN
DEFINE
ARMED
BETTER
GO
SHOOT
A
REVOLVER
AND
A
SEMIAUTO
LIKE
THE
COLT
DOES
ONE
FIRES
FASTER
THAN
THE
OTHER
NOPE
ASIDE
FROM
WHICH
FASTER
RATE
OF
FIRE
IS
USUALLY
NOT
DESIRABLE
SURE
IT
MAKES
THE
OTHER
GUYS
DUCK
FOR
COVER
BUT
JUST
YOU
TRYING
HITTING
ANYTHING
WITH
A
THOMPSON
IN
HOSEMODE
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
MILITARY
IS
LIMITING
ITS
NOW
TO
BURSTFIRE
SIMPLE
SEMIAUTO
WOULD
BE
BETTER
BUT
THE
TROOPS
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
ROCK
AND
ROLL
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
WASTEFUL
OF
AMMO
SOMETHING
OFTEN
IN
SHORT
SUPPLY
WHEN
THE
ENEMY
IS
PLENTIFUL
A
REVOLVER
IS
EQUALLY
CAPABLE
AS
A
SEMIAUTO
IN
THE
SAME
CALIBER
A
REVOLVER
ALSO
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
THAT
IF
IT
MISFIRES
YOU
JUST
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
AGAIN
A
DOUBLEACTION
REVOLVER
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THEM
CAN
BE
HANDCOCKED
FIRST
BUT
WILL
FIRE
MERELY
BY
PULLING
THE
TRIGGER
YES
BUT
THIS
IS
BEST
DONE
WITH
A
TWO
HAND
HOLD
WITH
A
SINGLE
HAND
YOU
EITHER
PULL
THE
GUN
FAR
OFF
TARGET
TO
COCK
OR
MUST
FIRE
DOUBLE
ACTION
THE
DA
SEMI
AUTO
HAS
THE
SAME
ADVANTAGES
PLUS
IS
ALWAYS
SA
AFTER
THE
FIRST
SHOT
A
MISFIRE
IN
A
REVOLVER
MERELY
MEANS
YOU
MUST
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
AGAIN
TO
ROTATE
TO
THE
NEXT
ROUND
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
MEANT
TO
BE
DIFFERENT
FROM
YOUR
FIRST
POINT
IN
A
DA
SEMIAUTO
YOU
CAN
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
AGAIN
TO
TRY
DROPPING
THE
HAMMER
ON
THE
SAME
ROUND
AN
ADVANTAGE
YOU
DONT
HAVE
IN
A
REVOLVER
WHERE
THE
NEXT
TRIGGER
PULL
WILL
ALWAYS
GO
TO
THE
NEXT
ROUND
DISCUSSING
THIS
POINT
NOW
THIS
IS
FINE
WITH
A
DUD
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
A
HANGFIRE
SITUATION
GRANTED
ITS
VERY
RARE
BUT
YOUR
ROUND
WILL
NOW
GO
OFF
CONFINED
IN
THE
CYLINDER
WITH
NO
PLACE
TO
GO
SLINGSHOTTING
THE
SLIDE
ON
A
MISFIRE
TAKES
VERY
LITTLE
TIME
A
REVOLVER
CAN
BE
CARRIED
WITH
THE
CHAMBER
EMPTY
AND
UNDER
THE
HAMMER
FOR
MAXIMUM
SAFETY
BUT
STILL
CAN
BE
DRAWN
AND
FIRED
WITH
AN
EASY
MOTION
EVEN
ONE
HANDED
ACTUALLY
WITH
MODERN
REVOLVER
DESIGNS
INCORPORATING
HAMMER
BLOCKS
THIS
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
OR
USUALLY
RECOMMENDED
A
REVOLVER
WOULD
HAVE
TO
FALL
HARD
ENOUGH
AND
AT
THE
RIGHT
ANGLE
TO
ACTUALLY
BREAK
THE
HAMMER
AND
DRIVER
THE
FIRING
PIN
INTO
THE
ROUND
TO
SET
IT
OFF
SPEEDLOADERS
FOR
A
REVOLVER
ALLOW
RELOADS
ALMOST
AS
FAST
AS
MAGAZINES
ON
SEMIAUTOS
CAN
BE
FASTER
DEPENDING
ON
USERS
THE
BEST
SPEEDLOADER
USERS
ESPECIALLY
THOSE
USING
THE
SPRING
LOADED
SPEED
LOADERS
ARE
VERY
FAST
A
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
EJECTING
THE
SPENT
CASES
IS
A
TWO
HANDED
JOB
WHERE
DROPPING
THE
EXPENDED
MAGAZINE
IS
ONE
HANDED
THIS
MEANS
THAT
WHILE
YOU
CAN
BE
INSERTING
A
FRESH
MAGAZINE
AS
SOON
AS
THE
OLD
ONE
CLEARS
THE
GUN
WITH
A
SPEED
LOADER
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
THROUGH
MORE
MOTIONS
THAT
WILL
ALWAYS
TAKE
MORE
TIME
YOU
ALSO
DONT
HAVE
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
TACTICAL
RELOADS
REPLACING
A
PARTIAL
MAGAZINE
TO
BRING
YOU
BACK
TO
FULL
CAPACITY
THE
PARTIAL
MAGAZINE
CAN
STILL
BE
USED
IF
NEEDED
LATER
A
MISFIRE
IN
A
SEMIAUTO
WILL
REQUIRE
YOU
TO
CLEAR
A
JAMMED
SHELL
FIRST
TIME
SPENT
WHICH
CAN
BE
FATAL
AND
A
VITAL
SECOND
OR
SO
IS
OFTEN
LOST
AS
YOU
REALIZE
HEY
ITS
JAMMED
BEFORE
STARTING
TO
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
CLEARING
IT
YES
THE
TIME
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
JUST
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
THE
TIME
TO
CLEAR
IT
REALLY
THOUGH
IN
EITHER
A
REVOLVER
OR
SEMIAUTO
THE
ODDS
OF
AN
ACTUAL
MISFIRE
WITH
FACTORY
AMMO
ARE
AWFULLY
SMALL
YOU
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
GET
A
JAM
IN
A
SEMIAUTO
BUT
EVEN
THESE
ARE
EXCEPTIONALLY
RARE
WITH
MODERN
QUALITY
GUNS
SIGS
GLOCKS
ETAL
MOST
SEMIAUTOS
MUST
HAVE
THE
SLIDE
WORKED
TO
CHAMBER
THE
FIRST
ROUND
AND
COCK
THE
HAMMER
SOME
POLICE
CARRY
THEIR
SEMIAUTOS
WITH
THE
CHAMBER
LOADED
AND
HAMMER
COCKED
BUT
A
SAFETY
ENGAGED
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THIS
SAFE
HOWEVER
YOU
MUST
TRADEOFF
SAFETY
TO
GET
THE
SAME
SPEED
OF
EMPLOYMENT
AS
A
REVOLVER
THERE
ARE
SOME
DOUBLEACTION
SEMIAUTOS
OUT
THERE
BUT
THE
COMPLEXITY
OF
OPERATION
OF
MANY
OF
THEM
REQUIRES
MORE
TRAINING
ALL
COMMON
SEMIAUTOS
CAN
BE
CARRIED
WITH
A
ROUND
IN
THEIR
CHAMBER
WITHOUT
ANY
SAFETY
PROBLEMS
WHILE
I
PUT
THAT
OUT
AS
A
STATEMENT
THAT
I
BELIEVE
I
SHOULD
SAY
THAT
THIS
APPLIES
TO
ALL
OF
THE
ONES
IVE
LOOKED
AT
FOR
THE
DA
SEMIS
ITS
NO
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
REVOLVER
SITUATION
THE
GUNS
ALL
HAVE
HAMMER
OR
FIRING
PIN
BLOCKS
THEY
ALSO
HAVE
A
SAFETY
BECAUSE
THERES
NO
REAL
ADVANTAGE
CARRYING
ONE
OF
THESE
COCKED
AND
LOCKED
YOU
HAVE
THE
SAME
SAFETY
AND
SPEED
OF
EMPLOYMENT
AS
A
REVOLVER
PLUS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
SA
FOLLOWUP
SHOTS
IM
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
SA
SEMIAUTOS
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
I
ADMIT
THAT
I
WAS
INITIALLY
SKEPTICAL
ABOUT
CARRYING
THIS
COCKED
AND
LOCKED
BUT
AFTER
EXAMINING
THE
DESIGN
TRYING
TO
DEFEAT
THE
SAFETIES
GUN
UNLOADED
OF
COURSE
AND
SHOOTING
IT
A
LOT
I
SEE
NO
INHERENT
SAFETY
PROBLEMS
WITH
IT
ESPECIALLY
IN
A
THUMBREAK
HOLSTER
WITH
THE
STRAP
UNDER
THE
HAMMER
THIS
DESIGN
ALSO
GETS
YOU
MORE
SPEED
FOR
AN
ACCURATE
FIRST
SHOT
THAN
A
REVOLVER
SOME
POLICE
DEPARTMENTS
SWITCHED
TO
GLOCKS
AND
THEN
STARTED
QUIETLY
SWITCHING
MANY
OFFICERS
BACK
TO
THE
OLD
REVOLVERS
TOO
MANY
WERE
HAVING
ACCIDENTS
PARTLY
DUE
TO
THE
POOR
TRAINING
THEY
RECEIVED
NOT
THAT
GLOCKS
REQUIRE
ROCKET
SCIENTISTS
BUT
SOME
COPS
ARE
BAFFLED
BY
SOMETHING
AS
COMPLEX
AS
THE
TIMER
ON
A
VCR
YEAH
THE
INFAMOUS
GLOCK
I
STILL
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
ITS
WORSE
THAN
A
REVOLVER
FOR
SAFETY
IF
YOU
DONT
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
IT
DOESNT
GO
OFF
I
IMAGINE
THAT
IF
ALL
YOUR
REVOLVER
SHOOTING
WAS
DONE
DOUBLE
ACTION
THEN
YOU
COULD
PULL
THE
GLOCK
TRIGGER
FAR
ENOUGH
TO
FIRE
BEFORE
YOU
REALIZED
IT
IN
ADDITION
IF
YOU
HAD
DEVELOPED
THAT
NASTY
HABIT
OF
KEEPING
YOUR
FINGER
ON
THE
TRIGGER
WHEN
HOLSTERING
YOUR
GUN
AND
RELYING
ON
YOUR
THUMB
ON
THE
HAMMER
TO
REMIND
YOU
TO
TAKE
IT
OFF
BEFORE
YOU
BLEW
OFF
YOUR
FOOT
THEN
YOUD
HAVE
PROBLEMS
WHEN
THE
HAMMER
WASNT
THERE
ANYONE
WHO
GOES
ANYONE
SAYING
THAT
THE
CRIMINALS
OBVIOUSLY
OUTGUN
THE
POLICE
DONT
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
FIREARMS
TURN
OFF
COPS
AND
HUNTER
AND
PAY
ATTENTION
I
DO
NOT
SEEK
HERE
TO
SAY
SEMIAUTOS
ARE
JUNK
MERELY
THAT
ASSUMING
THEY
ARE
BETTER
FOR
ALL
JOBS
IS
STUPID
A
COP
WITH
A
REVOLVER
ON
HIS
HIP
AND
A
SHOTGUN
IN
THE
RACK
IS
MORE
THAN
EQUIPPED
FOR
ANYTHING
SHORT
OF
A
RIOT
I
THINK
THIS
IS
EVEN
OKAY
FOR
A
RIOT
AS
LONG
AS
ITS
A
SMALL
ONE
B
GUN
CONTROL
IS
HITTING
WHAT
YOU
AIM
AT
IF
YOU
WHIP
OUT
A
WONDERNINE
AND
FIRE
REAL
FAST
YOU
MAY
FIND
YOU
DONT
HIT
ANYTHING
GOOD
CONTROLLED
FIRE
FROM
A
REVOLVER
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
GET
YOU
A
HIT
I
OWN
A
BERETTA
MYSELF
BUT
CONSIDER
IT
INFERIOR
AS
A
CARRY
WEAPON
TO
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
RUGER
SECURITY
SIX
REVOLVER
IF
I
HAVENT
HIT
WHAT
IM
AIMING
AT
IN
THE
FIRST
SHOTS
SOMETHING
IS
QUITE
SERIOUSLY
WRONG
SOMEWHERES
WHILE
I
MIGHT
LIKE
HAVING
THE
BACKUP
CAPACITY
OF
THOSE
EXTRA
SHOTS
IN
CERTAIN
CASES
OVERWHELMINGLY
THE
OF
SHOTS
FIRED
IN
CRIMINAL
ENCOUNTERS
IS
LESS
THAN
I
HAVE
THE
POOR
MANS
BERETTA
TAURUS
AND
CONSIDER
IT
INFERIOR
AS
A
CARRY
WEAPON
TO
THE
SPRINGFIELD
OOPS
VS
ARGUMENTS
ARE
RELEGATED
TO
RG
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
THOUGH
IF
YOU
DONT
HIT
WHAT
YOU
AIM
AT
THEN
THE
SHOOTERGUN
COMBINATION
HAS
FAILED
I
DONT
ASCRIBE
FAILURES
IN
THE
THE
FIRE
REAL
FAST
WITH
A
WONDERNINE
SCENARIO
YOU
MENTION
TO
THE
GUN
THIS
IS
A
SHOOTER
FAILURE
WHETHER
THROUGH
LACK
OF
DISCIPLINE
OR
LACK
OF
TRAINING
WHAT
DO
CROOKS
OVERWHELMINGLY
USE
IN
CRIME
WHY
THE
SAME
NICE
SIMPLE
REVOLVERS
THAT
THE
POLICE
OFTEN
USE
WELL
ACTUALLY
SOME
POLICE
PREFER
THE
MUCH
HEFTIER
MAGNUM
BUT
ANYWAY
ARE
BECOMING
MORE
POPULAR
WITH
CROOKS
TOO
THOUGH
THE
DOES
STILL
LEAD
THE
LIST
AND
LIKE
I
SAID
AROUND
HERE
SEMIAUTOS
SEEM
THE
RULE
FOR
THE
STREET
COP
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
STATE
PATROL
HOWEVER
THEY
MAY
STILL
CARRY
THE
HIGHWAY
PATROLMAN
OBPLEA
DONT
FLAME
ME
I
PREFER
SEMIAUTOS
FOR
MOST
THINGS
BUT
THEY
INTRODUCE
UNNECCESSARY
COMPLICATIONS
TO
SOMETHING
AS
NERVEWRACKING
AS
AN
ABRUPT
ENCOUNTER
WITH
A
LONE
CRIMINAL
VINCENT
PLEASE
DONT
TAKE
ANY
OF
THIS
AS
A
FLAME
JUST
MY
WHOOPS
LOOKS
MORE
LIKE
WORTH
AND
MUCH
OF
IT
IS
IMHO

DO
