as
quoted
from
by
jrmgnvifasufledu
the
press
is
against
you
the
public
the
voting
public
is
against
you
the
flow
of
history
is
against
you
this
is
it
kind
of
sounds
like
plessy
v
ferguson
huh
of
course
as
in
that
case
things
change
huh
too
fucking
bad
you
have
gone
the
way
of
the
kkk
violent
solutions

situations
which
encourage
criminals
then
you
will
be
as
safe
as
possible
such
as

is
no
if
your
little
fantasy
comes
to
pass
the

youre
of

being
a
little
disengenuous
violent

quite
certain
that

a
surfeit
of
unarmed
victims
will
discourage
your
beloved
kkk
from
engaging
in
violent
solutions
youre
like
a

of
