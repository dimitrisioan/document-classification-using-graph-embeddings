there
is
a
new
ice
cream
flavor
inspired
by
the
incident
at
waco
its
called
mount
caramel
its
full
of
nuts
but
you
cant
get
it
out
of
the
carton
cdtrocketswstratuscom
if
you
believe
that
i
speak
for
my
company
or
cdtvosstratuscom
write
today
for
my
special
investors
packet
even
though
i
find
this
to
be
funny
on
the
surface
the
original
poster
of
the
joke
has
tried
and
convicted
the
members
of
the
bd
to
be
a
bunch
of
nuts
this
may
be
a
dangerous
thing
to
do
it
is
my
opinion
that
most
educated
or
well
informed
people
of
this
country
have
some
distrust
of
the
government
this
should
exist
because
as
a
bureaucracy
any
government
given
enough
time
will
tend
to
exist
for
it
self
and
not
for
the
original
purpose
it
was
created
for
this
distrust
by
the
people
should
keep
those
in
power
inline
that
and
a
properly
functioning
press
when
a
sensationalism
oriented
press
portrays
a
group
of
people
as
nuts
or
crazies
a
violation
of
those
peoples
civil
rights
seem
justified
since
we
as
americans
have
the
gurantee
of
rights
as
enumerated
in
the
constitution
to
include
the
ammendment
the
government
must
appease
the
publics
opinion
or
risk
voted
out
of
existance
or
if
it
has
become
corrupt
enough
to
tamper
with
domocratic
process
itself
being
thrown
out
by
force
our
government
as
it
stands
must
appease
the
public
therefore
the
official
press
releases
portray
the
bds
as
fanatics
who
are
a
threat
to
public
safety
we
must
not
prejudge
people
based
on
one
sided
information
so
far
the
only
information
that
we
are
being
given
is
comming
from
the
very
agency
that
was
embarrased
by
the
bdbranch
davidians
sp
it
is
to
their
advantage
to
make
the
bds
as
fanatical
and
dangerous
as
possible
if
they
were
portrayed
as
lawabiding
citizens
then
theyatf
had
no
justification
what
so
ever
of
doing
what
they
did
so
lets
keep
an
open
mind
jokes
like
above
even
though
it
may
be
funny
may
mislead
the
public
from
the
truth
of
the
matter
just
as
an
aside
my
understanding
of
us
vs
rock
island
and
us
vs
dalton
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
national
firearms
act
which
allows
the
feds
in
this
case
atf
to
regulate
firearmsmachine
guns
has
been
deemed
to
be
unconstitutional
since
two
federal
district
courts
at
least
and
since
i
believe
the
only
reason
atf
was
involved
in
this
case
is
because
of
firearms
violations
it
would
be
interesting
to
find
out
whether
or
not
the
search
warrent
was
based
on
the
nfa
it
would
be
very
embarrassing
indeed
if
a
search
warrent
based
on
a
possibly
unconstitutional
law
has
resulted
in
deathslaw
enforcement
the
above
opinions
are
mine
and
mine
only
im
solely
responsible
for
my
opinions
and
my
actions
if
you
must
flame
then
flame
away
but
a
well
constructed
argument
will
be
much
more
respected
