i
also
believe
texas
has
some
of
the
most
liberal
gunlaws
in
usa
in
texas
you
cannot
carry
a
handgun
period
either
concealed
or
open
currently
there
is
a
bill
before
the
texas
legislature
that
would
make
it
legal
for
some
ordinary
folks
to
carry
concealed
weapons
i
dont
have

if
i
recall
correctly
the
bill
would
provide
for
concealed
carry
if
the
person
takes
a
dps
safety
course
in
firearms
and
pays
a
fee
for
the
license
the
bill
is
apparently
vetoproof
in
the
house
but
ltgov
bullock
has
said
it
will
never
come
to
the
floor
of

and

vowed
to
veto
it
if
it
comes
