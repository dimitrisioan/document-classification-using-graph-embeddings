last
year
the
us
suffered
almost
wrongful
or
accidental
deaths
by
handguns
alone
fbi
statistics
in
the
same
year
the
uk
suffered
such
deaths
scotland
yard
statistics
the
population
of
the
uk
is
about
that
of
the
us
weighted
for
population
the
us
has
as
many
handgunrelated
deaths
as
the
uk
and
no
the
brits
dont
make
up
for
this
by
murdering
as
many
people
with
baseball
bats
if
you
examine
the
figures
they
do
stabbing
is
favourite
closely
followed
by
striking
punching
kicking
many
more
people
are
burnt
to
death
in
britain
as
are
shot
to
death
take
at
look
and
youll
see
for
yourself
it
means
that
very
few
people
are
shot
to
death
in
great
britain
and
im
sure
that
is
a
great
comfort
to
the
widows
and
children
of
those
stabbed
beaten
and
burned
to
death
the
real
question
is
did
the
crime
rate
in
england
go
down
after
they
enacted
gun
control
laws
if
you
look
at
the
rates
before
and
after
their
first
such
law
in
you
will
see
no
effect
