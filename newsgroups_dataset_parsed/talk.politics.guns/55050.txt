RE
REWORDING
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
IDEAS
DFOVTTOULUTKOVTTFI
FOXVOG
DOUGLAS
WRITES
VIKINGIASTATEEDU
DAN
SORENSON
WRITES
THAT
REALLY
DEPENDS
UPON
WHERE
YOU
DRAW
THE
LINE
WHILE
DEFINING
THESE
WEAPONS
THIS
MEANS
YOU
WOULD
SUPPORT
A
BAN
IF
IT
WERE
NARROW
ENOUGH
GOOD
VERY
NARROW
VERY
VERY
NARROW
IF
YOULL
RECALL
I
WAS
THE
NUT
THAT
ADVOCATED
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
TACTICAL
NUKES
BEING
MILITIA
WEAPONS
IN
CERTAIN
SITUATIONS
HOW
CAN
YOU
POSSIBLY
DEFINE
WHAT
IS
A
WEAPON
AND
WHAT
ISNT
IS
ONLY
THE
START
OF
THIS
AND
ALSO
ON
IF
YOU
INTEND
THE
LAW
TO
BE
REFLECTIVE
OF
MODERN
PRACTICE
FIVE
MONTHS
OR
FIVE
CENTURIES
DOWN
THE
ROAD
I
WOULD
HOPE
SO
LETS
DEFINE
A
NUCLEAR
WEAPON
AS
AN
EXPLOSIVE
WEAPON
WHOSE
MAJORITY
OF
ENERGY
COMES
FROM
FISSION
ANDOR
FUSION
OF
ATOMIC
NUCLEI
AND
YOUVE
JUST
DESCRIBED
ANY
CIVILIAN
REACTOR
BECAUSE
YOUR
DEFINITION
FAILS
TO
NOTE
WHAT
ENERGY
IS
BEING
CONSIDERED
REACTORS
BLOW
WITH
A
STEAM
EXPLOSION
BUT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
ENERGY
STILL
COMES
FROM
FISSION
OR
FUSION
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
WHAT
HEATED
THE
COOLANT
SEE
WHAT
A
CAN
OF
WORMS
THIS
IS
LAST
I
HEARD
FT
CALHOUN
STATION
JUST
NORTH
OF
OMAHA
NEBRASKA
WASNT
CONSIDERED
A
WEAPON
GIVEN
THE
SODIUMCOOLED
BREEDER
DESIGNS
ON
THE
BLOCKS
NOW
I
CAN
EASILY
ENVISION
REACTORS
BEING
HOUSEHOLD
APPLIANCES
IN
UNDER
TWENTY
YEARS
WITH
THE
PRISM
DESIGN
THERE
IS
NO
OPERATOR
INPUT
NEEDED
ON
THE
REACTOR
ITSELF
AND
IT
IS
NOT
UNREASONABLE
TO
ASSUME
THE
SECONDARY
SIDE
CAN
BE
MADE
EQUALLY
AS
AUTOMATIC
IN
THE
FUTURE
SO
YOUR
DEFINITION
IS
FLAWED
IN
A
FEW
RESPECTS
ALREADY
LETS
DEFINE
A
BIOLOGICAL
WEAPON
AS
LIVE
ORGANISMS
OR
VIRUSES
IN
SUCH
STATE
QUANTITY
AND
WITH
SUCH
A
VECTOR
THAT
THEY
COULD
CAUSE
DEATH
OR
SERIOUS
DISEASE
FURTHER
DEFINED
TO
A
SIGNIFICANT
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
IF
RELEASED
IN
A
CITY
SIMILARLY
POPULATED
AREA
RESEVOIR
OR
CROPLAND
TYPHOID
MARY
WOULD
LIKELY
FIT
THIS
BILL
IF
SHE
SNEEZED
IF
YOU
DONT
MIND
EXTRAPOLATION
ANY
HIVPOSITIVE
PERSON
ALSO
FITS
THIS
BILL
IF
THEY
INTERACT
WITH
OTHERS
IN
A
WAY
THAT
STANDS
ANY
CHANCE
OF
SPREADING
THE
VIRUS
FINALLY
THAT
MANURE
PILE
I
MENTION
BELOW
FITS
THIS
DEFINITION
AS
DOES
SAY
RELEASING
A
PET
RATTLESNAKE
TO
THE
WILD
NERVE
GAS
AND
MUSTARD
GAS
ARE
WELL
DEFINED
OTHER
POISONOUS
GASSES
SHOULD
BE
INDIVIDUALLY
BANNED
ONLY
IF
IT
CAN
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
USE
NOT
RELATED
TO
WEAPONRY
LICENSES
SHOULD
BE
AVAILABLE
FOR
RESEARCH
PURPOSES
ON
SUCH
CHEMICALS
AND
I
CAN
SHOW
WHERE
ANY
SUCH
GAS
HAS
OTHER
USES
FOR
EXAMPLE
PERHAPS
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
RID
THE
HAY
FIELD
OF
GOPHERS
CALCIUM
CARBIDE
IS
A
ROCK
THAT
DISSOLVES
IN
WATER
TO
PRODUCE
ACETEYLNE
GAS
IT
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
WELDING
IN
MINERS
LAMPS
FOR
GASSING
GOPHERS
OR
FOR
MAKING
CARBIDE
BOMBS
AND
DOING
SOME
ILLICIT
FISHING
TOSS
SOME
IN
A
TOILET
AND
LEAVE
A
LIGHTED
CIGARETTE
ON
THE
SEAT
AND
YOULL
SEE
THAT
IT
CAN
ALSO
BE
A
WEAPON
JUST
LIKE
ANY
OTHER
FLAMMABLE
SUBSTANCE
SO
NOW
MY
MINERS
LAMPS
WONT
WORK
I
CANT
DO
ANY
WELDING
AND
I
STILL
HAVE
THOSE
PESKY
GOPHERS
I
AM
NOT
A
LAWYER
BUT
THESE
IDEAS
COULD
CERTAINLY
BE
A
BASIS
FOR
DEFINITIONS
THE
BASIS
FOR
BUT
IM
SURE
YOU
SEE
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
IN
WRITING
A
LAW
IT
IS
IN
WRITING
A
LAW
THAT
CANNOT
BE
ABUSED
AND
EXTENDED
BEYOND
THE
POINT
WHERE
IT
DOES
ANY
GOOD
ILL
GIVE
YOU
A
LITTLE
HINT
SEE
THAT
MANURE
PILE
IN
THE
FARMERS
FIELD
DOWN
THE
ROAD
IN
THE
USA
THAT
IS
A
WEAPON
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
NOPE
IT
IS
NOT
CONSIDERED
A
WEAPON
IT
IS
UNDER
YOUR
PROPOSED
LAW
SO
IS
A
SILAGE
PIT
IF
THERE
IS
RUNOFF
SO
ARE
UNDERGROUND
FUEL
TANKS
BIOLOGICAL
IN
NATURE
BECAUSE
IF
IT
GETS
WASHED
INTO
AN
OPEN
WELL
IT
WILL
CONTAMINATE
THE
AQUIFERS
THAT
SUPPLY
THOUSANDS
OF
CITIES
WITH
DRINKING
WATER
SO
WHERE
DO
YOU
DRAW
THE
LINE
IN
THE
USA
THE
EPA
HAS
RULED
THAT
A
PILE
OF
SCRAP
IRON
IS
ILLEGAL
CARE
TO
DRAW
A
THINNER
LINE
THIS
TIME
IT
IS
NOT
DEFINED
AS
A
WEAPON
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
MANY
THINGS
ARE
BANNED
FOR
OTHER
REASONS
IT
MEETS
ALL
THE
CRITERION
OF
A
WEAPON
IT
IS
AN
INSTRUMENT
THAT
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
FIGHTING
EVEN
THOUGH
THAT
IS
NOT
ITS
INTENDED
PURPOSE
AND
DESPITE
THERE
BEING
BETTER
WEAPONS
AROUND
GIVEN
THAT
THE
AQUIFERS
SUPPLY
A
SIGNIFICANT
PART
OF
THE
COUNTRY
WITH
DRINKING
WATER
MASS
DESTRUCTION
IS
RATHER
A
GIVEN
ITS
NOT
THAT
CERTAIN
WEAPONS
ARENT
SOMETHING
ID
RATHER
NOT
SEE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
HAVING
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
IT
IS
NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
WRITE
A
LAW
SUCH
THAT
IT
CANNOT
BE
ABUSED
UPON
SOME
PRETEXT
OR
ANOTHER
THE
LOOSER
YOUR
DEFINITION
THE
MORE
RIPE
FOR
ABUSE
THAT
LAW
IS
FURTHERMORE
IF
YOU
GET
SPECIFIC
THEN
THE
OLD
STANDBY
IS
TO
INSERT
A
CLAUSE
ALLOWING
THE
LIST
OF
BANNED
THINGS
TO
BE
ADDED
TO
GENERALLY
WITHOUT
GOING
THROUGH
THE
HASSLES
OF
ANOTHER
VOTE
AND
PUBLIC
READING
OF
THE
LAW
AGAIN
RIPE
FOR
ABUSE
DAN
SORENSON
DOD
VIKINGIASTATEEDU
ISU
ONLY
CENSORS
WHAT
I
READ
NOT
WHAT
I
SAY
DONT
BLAME
