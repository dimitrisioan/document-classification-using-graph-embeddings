my

i
dont
remember
the
figures
exactly
but
there
were
about
deaths
in
texas
in
that
was
caused
by
guns
this
is
more
than
those
beeing
killed
in
caraccidents
yes
there
could
be
that
low
sentences
or
high
poverty
could
influence
the
figures
but
theyre
still
pretty
high
right
i
also
believe
texas
has
some
of
the
most
liberal
gunlaws
in
usa
in
texas
you
cannot
carry
a
handgun
period
either
concealed
or
open
and
your
numbers
are
misleading
they
include
suicides
and
accidents
the
real
number
from
the
department
of
public
safety
murders
nonneg
hom
car
fatalities
texas
only
has
liberal
gun
laws
as
far
as
purchasing
a
firearm
aside
from
that
its
probably
more
restrictive
than
most
states
as
far
as
carry
goes
one
state
dont
remember
which
texas
tried
to
impose
a
rule
that
you
could
only
buy
one
gun
each
month
think
you
all
know
what
happened
the
state
was
virginia
and
the
law
passed
i
respect
the
right
to
defend
yourself
but
that
right
should
not
inflict
on
other
people
that
right
only
inflicts
on
those
who
threaten
my
rights
to
life
liberty
the
pursuit
of
happiness
etc
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
a
criminal
and
i
dont
indiscriminately
fire
my
weapons
at
random
so
please
explain
how
i
am
inflicting
anything
on
other
people
this
is
not
a
signature
its
merely
a
computergenerated
text
to
waste
bandwith
and
to
bring
down
the
evil
internet
