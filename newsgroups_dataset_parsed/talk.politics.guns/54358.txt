and
has
no
rights
under
the
federal
constitution
so
what
i
dont
understand
is
how
a
statute
like
can
be
enforced
on
an
individual
so
someone
tell
me
how
my
government
can
tell
me
what
i
can
or
cannot
possess
just
passing
a
law
does
not
make
it
law
sorry
but
i
really
cant
figure
out
what
youre
trying
to
say
above
i
guess
what
i
am
really
asking
like
i
did
above
how
does
my
government
who
is
my
servent
tell
me
the
soveriegn
what
i
can
or
cannot
possess
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
act
of
possessing
a
machine
gun
is
no
less
criminal
by
definition
than
the
act
of
possessing
a
television
set
i
also
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
better
to
pass
laws
that
say
that
if
i
harm
or
kill
someone
with
the
machine
gun
or
the
television
set
that
there
would
be
specific
penalties
for
doing
such
everyone
knows
that
laws
are
constitional
until
it
goes
to
court
sorry
i
was
close
not
exactly
no
on
is
bound
to
obey
an
uncontitutional
law
and
no
courts
are
bound
to
enforce
it
