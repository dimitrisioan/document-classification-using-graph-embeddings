correction
the
fbi
says
that
two
of
the
nine
who
escaped
said
the
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
cult
members
since
the
press
was
kept
miles
away
we
have
absolutely
no
independent
verification
of
any
of
the
governments
claims
in
this
matter
moreover
the
batf
has
admitted
having
agents
in
the
compound
and
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
ascertain
those
agents
were
still
in
the
compound
when
the
first
shots
were
fired
for
all
we
know
these
two
people
may
be
the
agents
who
would
certainly
be
unlikely
to
stay
around
and
cook
with
the
faithful
assuming
the
two
people
in
question
were
even
in
the
compound
at
all
maybe
i
sound
paranoid
but
i
watched
janet
reno
last
night
harping
on
how
much
david
koresh
was
a
big
bad
child
abuser
and
i
kept
wondering
why
she
much
less
batf
wanted
us
to
infer
that
she
had
any
jurisdiction
over
such
accusations
in
the
first
place
im
positive
that
the
sealed
warrant
is
not
for
child
abuse
what
was
it
for
peobably
weapons
violations
janet
reno
didnt
say
word
one
last
night
about
weapons
violations
why
because
she
knows
that
such
a
case
is
no
longer
believable
