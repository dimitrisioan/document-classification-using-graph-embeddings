I
WAS
HOPING
THAT
KENT
STATE
TAUGHT
US
A
LESSON
APPARENTLY
NOT
APPARENTLY
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
MURDER
ANYONE
THEY
CHOOSE
TO
STILL
THATS
RIGHT
DESPITE
CLAIMS
THAT
SOMEONE
AT
KENT
STATE
FIRE
A
SHOTGUN
AT
THE
THE
SOLDIERS
THE
ONLY
PROJECTILES
THAT
ANYONE
CAN
PROVE
WHERE

NO
FIREARMS
WERE
EVER
EVER
SHOT
AT
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
AT
KENT
STATE
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
SHOOTING
NO
ROCKS
WERE
BEING
THROWN
AT
ALL
THE
SQUAD
WAS
SLOWLY
PROCEEDING
UP
A
KNOLL
AWAY
FROM
THE
BODY
OF
STUDENTS
SOME
STUDENTS
WERE
TAUNTING
THEM
AND
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
THE
INCIDENT
SHOW
AT
MOST
ONE
OR
TWO
STUDENTS
WHO
WERE
FOLLOWING
AND
TAUNTING
THE
SERIES
OF
PHOTOGRAPHS
SHOW
THE
SQUAD
SLOWLY
PROCEEDING
UP
THE
HILL
WHILE
OCCASIONALLY
THEIR
NCO
IN
HAND
TURNED
BACK
TO
LOOK
AT
WHERE
THEY
CAME
FROM
ALL
AT
ONCE
AS
IF
ON
COMMAND
THE
ENTIRE
SQUAD
TURNED
AND
FIRED
THEIR
GARANDS
FIRING
ROUNDS
INTO
THE
CROWD
THE
NCO
CAN
BE
SHOWN
WITH
THIS
AT
FULL
RECOIL
AT
LEAST
TWO
OF
THE
STUDENTS
SHOT
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
TAUNTERS
THEY
WERE
ONLY
PASSING
THROUGH
AND
WERE
NOT
PARTICIPANTS
IN
THE
CONFRONTATION
THERE
IS
SOME
DISPUTE
WHETHER
THE
GUARD
WAS
EVEN
LEGALLY
ON
CAMPUS
APPARENTLY
THEY
HAD
NOT
BEEN
INVITED
ONTO
THE
STATE
SCHOOL
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
WHO
HAD
CONVENIENTLY
FLOWN
THE
COOP
SO
AS
NOT
TO
BE
AROUND
THE
GOVERNOR
OF
OHIO
JAMES
RHODES
HAD
JUST
EMBARKED
ON
A
SENATE
CAMPAIGN
AND
WANTED
IT
TO
BE
KNOWN
THAT
HE
WAS
TOUGH
ON
PEACENIKS
SO
HAD
ORDERED
THE
GUARD
IN
THE
MATTER
WAS
QUICKLY
COVERED
UP
SOME
YEARS
LATER
WOUNDED
SURVIVORS
LAUNCHED
A
CIVIL
LAWSUIT
AGAINST
THOSE
RESPONSIBLE
A
SETTLEMENT
WAS
MADE
AND
UNDER
THE
TERMS
THE
PLAINTIFFS
COULD
NOT
DISCUSS
MUCH
AND
GUILTY
INDIVIDUALS
WERE
NOT
IDENTIFIED
IN
FACT
THOSE
SHOOTERS
IN
THE
SQUAD
HAVE
BEEN
IDENTIFIED
IT
WAS
A
TRAGIC
INCIDENT
BUT
IT
WAS
NOT
PROVOKED
BY
THE
STUDENTS
OR
APPARENTLY
BY
GENERAL
DELCORSO
OR
ANY
OF
HIS
COMMAND
FROM
STUDYING
THE
INCIDENT
THE
PHOTOS
IMO
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
IT
WAS
AN
INDEPENDENT
ACTION
BY
A
SMALL
SQUAD
OF
SOLDIERS
