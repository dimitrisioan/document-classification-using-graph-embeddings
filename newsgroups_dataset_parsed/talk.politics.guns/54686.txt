re
riddle
me
this
on
the
subject
of
cscntear
gas
when
i
received
my
initial
introduction
to
tear
gas
the
first
thing
that
came
to
mind
was
the
location
of
the
exit
if
there
had
been
anything
in
the
way
corners
to
negotiate
doors
to
open
or
any
other
obstacles
to
movement
i
would
have
had
a
difficult
time
exiting
the
chamber
and
any
concentration
of
tear
gas
is
hazardous
to
individuals
with
respiratory
problems
and
the
wearing
of
soft
contact
lenses
in
a
tear
gas
contaminated
area
is
considered
a
real
bad
idea
so
hoping
the
bds
would
peaceably
come
strolling
out
the
door
after
being
gassed
is
a
bit
unrealistic
if
they
could
have
found
the
door
having
them
staggering
out
retching
wouldnt
be
too
far
fetched
throw
in
the
factor
of
days
of
being
under
siege
and
subject
to
psychological
warfare
and
all
bets
on
functional
abilities
are
off
anybody
tried
to
get
amnesty
international
to
jump
in
on
this
one
james
s
cochrane
when
in
danger
or
in
doubt
run
in
this
space
circles
scream
and
shout
for
rent
