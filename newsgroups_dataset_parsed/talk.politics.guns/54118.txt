ARE
BANNED
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHEN
THIS
SUPPLY
WILL
DRY
UP
DRUGS
ARE
EASIER
TO
MANUFACTURE
EASIER
TO
SMUGGLE
EASIER
TO
HIDE
NO
COMPARISON
THEN
LETS
USE
ANOTHER
EXAMPLEALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGES
BOTTLES
OF
WHISKEY
ARE
LARGER
HEAVIER
AND
MORE
FRAGILE
THAN
BAGS
OF
DRUGS
BARRELS
AND
KEGS
ARE
LARGER
AND
HEAVIER
STILL
AND
ARE
DIFFICULT
TO
MANIPULATE
YET
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
MANAGED
TO
GET
VERY
RICH
OFF
OF
THE
SMUGGLING
OF
BOOZE
INTO
THIS
COUNTRY
DURING
THE
YEARS
OF
PROHIBITION
THERE
WAS
A
DEMAND
SO
AN
ENTIRE
INDUSTRY
FORMED
TO
SUPPLY
IT
IF
ALCOHOL
WERE
AGAIN
BANNED
TODAY
IT
WOULD
BE
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
MANAGE
A
LARGESCALE
SMUGGLING
OPERATION
THE
COPS
NOW
RANK
JUST
A
NARROW
NOTCH
BELOW
THE
MILITARY
IN
COMMUNICATIONS
INTELLIGENCE
GATHERING
AND
FIREPOWER
IN
A
SIMILAR
VEIN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
MARIJUANA
SMUGGLED
INTO
THIS
COUNTRY
HAS
GREATLY
DECREASED
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
ITS
VALUEPERPOUND
IS
VERY
LOW
WHEN
COMPARED
TO
COCAINE
OR
HEROIN
ITS
SIMPLY
NOT
WORTH
THE
RISK
ITS
UNECONOMICAL
NOW
MOST
REEFER
IS
DOMESTIC
THERE
IS
LESS
PRESSURE
ON
THE
DOMESTIC
PRODUCER
SHOWY
RAIDS
NOTWITHSTANDING
AND
THUS
IT
IS
ECONOMICAL
OF
NOTE
THOUGH
DOMESTIC
REEFER
IS
NOW
VERY
STRONG
SO
A
SMALL
VOLUME
GOES
A
LONG
WAY
YOU
CANNOT
MAKE
ALCOHOL
STRONGER
THAN
PROOF
NOT
A
GOOD
DOLLARPOUND
DEAL
FIREARMS
TEND
TO
FALL
INTO
THIS
LOW
DOLLARPOUND
AREA
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
ECONOMIC
TO
SMUGGLE
THEM
IN
ALL
PRODUCTION
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
LOCAL
THERE
ARE
NOT
ALL
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BOTH
THE
SKILL
AND
MOTIVATION
TO
ASSEMBLE
WORTHWHILE
FIREARMS
FROM
SCRATCH
HIGHRANKING
CRIME
FIGURES
COULD
OBTAIN

UZIS
AND
SUCH
BUT
THE

AND
AVERAGE
THUG
WOULD
BE
LUCKY

WOULD
