JUST
WHAT
THE
HELL
DO
YOU
BASE
THAT
LUDICROUS
CLAIM
ON
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
FINE
DECENT
PEOPLE
PEOPLE
WHO
READPOST
TO
TPG
IF
ANY
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
PARANOID
IT
IS
BECAUSE
OF
PEOPLE
LIKE
YOU
HEY
DUDE
YOU
ARE
MAKING
ME
PARANOID
WHAT
AN
ARGUMENT
WHILE
I
WOULDNT
BE
TOO
TERRIBLY
IMPRESSED
WITH
ANYBODY
WHO
GOT
TO
BE
PARANOID
BASED
ON
EITHER
USENET
IN
GENERAL
OR
PHILL
HALLAMBAKERS
COMMENTS
IN
GENERAL
YOUD
BE
SURPRISED
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
IF
YOU
ACCUSE
THEM
OF
SOMETHING
LONG
ENOUGH
AND
LOUD
ENOUGH
TO
ENOUGH
PEOPLE
THEY
START
TO
ASK
WHY
THEYRE
BOTHERING
TO
FIGHT
IT
IF
NOTHING
YOU
DO
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED
RIGHT
WHY
BOTHER
TO
DO
RIGHT
ITS
PRETTY
BASIC
HUMAN
NATURE
ID
HAVE
A
SPOT
OF
TEA
WITH
THEM
YOU
PROBABLY
GAVE
UP
ON
ARGUING
THE
CASE
FOR
ARMS
CONTROL
DIRECTLY
LONG
AGO
BECAUSE
POSTERS
WHO
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
EG
FRANK
CRARY
DISPROVED
ALL
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
FOR
WHY
MORE
GUN
CONTROL
IS
NEEDED
SO
YOU
GAVE
UP
BECAUSE
YOU
KNOW
THEY
ARE
RIGHT
AND
YOU
COULDNT
REFUTE
THEIR
ANSWERS
NO
FRANK
CRARYS
ARGUMENTS
ARE
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
SANE
NORMAL
PEOPLE
TPG
DISPROVES
THIS
OF
GUN
OWNERS
WHAT
AN
AMAZING
THING
I
DIDNT
REALIZE
THAT
OVER
A
HUNDRED
MILLION
GUN
OWNERS
ALL
POSTED
TO
TPG
EVEN
IF
ALL
THE
POSTS
IN
TALKPOLITICSGUNS
ILLUSTRATED
WHAT
YOU
SAY
THEY
ILLUSTRATE
IT
WOULD
STILL
ONLY
REFLECT
THE
WRITTEN
PERSONAS
WHICH
IS
OFTEN
DIFFERENT
FROM
FACETOFACE
OF
A
VERY
VERY
SMALL
AND
SELECT
GROUP
ANYBODY
WHO
SERIOUSLY
GENERALIZES
ANY
ATTITUDES
OR
POSITIONS
ON
USENET
TO
THE
GENERAL
POPULATION
OF
ANY
COUNTRY
EITHER
DOESNT
CARE
ABOUT
ACCURACY
OR
NEEDS
TO
HAVE
A
FEW
REALITIES
EXPLAINED
TO
THEM
USENET
AS
A
WHOLE
DISPROVES
IT
OF
HUMANITY
AS
A
WHOLE
SPEAKING
OF
WHICH
MOST
OF
THE
READERSHIP
POSTS
IVE
SEEN
PUT
THE
MOST
READ
NEWSGROUPS
AT
ABOUT
READERS
A
NUMBER
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
IS
FAIRLY
INFLATED
THE
POSTERS
RARE
AND
REGULAR
ARE
THEMSELEVES
A
VERY
TINY
MINORITY
OF
THAT
GROUP
AND
THE
WHOLE
OF
USENET
READERS
ARE
THEMSELVES
A
VERY
DISTORTED
SAMPLE
OF
HUMANITY
IF
ANYTHING
THE
ONLY
REAL
THING
YOU
CAN
GET
OUT
OF
THE
RELATIVE
SAMPLE
OF
USENET
READERS
IS
THAT
WEVE
GOT
TOO
MUCH
EQUIPMENT
AND
TOO
MUCH
TIME
AVAILABLE
TO
US
WE
NOW
HAVE
PROOF
POSITIVE
THAT
GUNS
DONT
MAKE
YOU
SAFER
BUY
A
LOT
OF
GUNS
AND
YOU
EITHER
GET
SHOT
IN
THE
NO
KNOCK
RAID
OR
GET
THE
FBI
TO
BURN
DOWN
YOUR
HOUSE
PROOF
THAT
GUNS
DONT
MAKE
YOU
SAFER
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
BUY
ONE
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
SHOW
UP
AND
KILL
YOU
TELL
ME
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
TOOK
AWAY
THE
VOTING
RIGHTS
OF
EVERYBODY
WHO
EXERCISED
THEIR
FREE
SPEECH
WOULD
THAT
THEN
BE
PROOF
THAT
FREE
SPEECH
SQUELCHES
POLITICAL
ACTIVITY
YOU
ARE
EQUATING
TWO
THINGS
WITH
EACH
OTHER
THAT
DONT
SEE
EVEN
IN
THE
PARANOID
MINDSET
OF
TPG
THERE
ARE
GOOD
REASONS
TO
SUPPORT
GUN
CONTROL
PHILL
IF
YOU
REALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
VARIOUS
POSTS
ON
COMPUTER
NETS
REPRESENTS
EITHER
MOST
OF
THE
POSTERS
IN
PERSON
PERSONALITIES
OR
THE
GENERAL
PUBLICS
GENERAL
OPINIONS
THEN
I
HAVE
SOME
SERIOUS
RESERVATIONS
ABOUT
YOUR
GRASP
ON
REALITY
BUT
DONT
EXPECT
YOU
REALLY
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
ITS
SIMPLY
A
CONVENIENT
WAY
TO
MAKE
YOUR
POINT

HOPEFULLY
MAKE
THOSE
