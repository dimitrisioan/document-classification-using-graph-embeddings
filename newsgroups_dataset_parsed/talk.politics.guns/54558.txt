NAPALM
THEN
LET
THE
WOOD
STOVE
INSIDE
IGNITE
IT
AS
SOMEONE
ELSE
HAS
POINTED
OUT
WHY
WOULD
THE
STOVE
BE
IN
USE
ON
A
WARM
DAY
IN
TEXAS
NOT
THAT
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
ORIGINAL
THEORY
OR
ANYTHING
BUUUUUT
SINCE
THEIR
UTILITIES
WERE
TURNED
OFF
THEY
MIGHT
BE
USING
WOOD
STOVES
TO
COOK

MEALS

UUNETCAISGTECROBERT
OR
ROBERTISGTECCOM
TO
ROB
AND
ALL
OTHERS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
DEBATING
ABOUT
THE
WOOD
STOVE
THE
ORIGINAL
POST
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
ATFFBI
WAS
PUMPING
NAPALM
INTO
THE
BUILDING
WITH
THE
HOPES
THAT
THE
WOOD
STOVE
INSIDE
WOULD
IGNITE
IT
I
RESPONED
WITH
WHY
WOULD
THE
WOOD
STOVE
BE
LIT
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IT
WOULDNT
BE
LIT
FOR
HEATING
PURPOSES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
WEATHER
IN
TEXAS
EVERYONE
NOW
CLAIMS
THAT
IT
WAS
FOR
COOKING
STOP
AND
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
CS
GAS
WAS
BEING
PUMPED
INTO
THE
BUILDING
AND
I
PRESUME
THAT
EVERYONE
WAS
WEARING
GAS
MASKS
EITHER
BOUGHT
OR
SOME
TYPE
OF
MAKESHIFT
TYPE
AND
THIS
HAD
BEEN
GOING
ON
FOR
HOURS
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
YOU
HAVE
EVER
BEEN
AROUND
CS
BUT
I
HAVE
BEING
EXPOSED
TO
CS
GAS
WAS
PART
OF
MY
ARMY
TRAINING
SO
I
KNOW
THAT
WITHOUT
A
MASK
IT
VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE
AND
MAKES
YOUR
EYES
WATER
NOSE
RUN
AND
MAKES
YOU
SICK
IN
THE
STOMACH
AND
WITH
THE
MASK
IT
IS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
DRINK
WATER
MUCH
LESS
EAT
SO
MY
QUESTION
NOW
IS
WHY
WERE
THEY
COOKING
FOOD
I
WILL
BUY
THAT
A
LANTERN
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
KNOCKED
OVER
AND
CAUSED
THE
FIRE
BUT
THAT
STOVE
WAS
NOT
BEING
USED
FOR
COOKING
UNLESS
THEY
WERE
EVEN
MORE
CRAZY
THAN
THE
ATFFBI
