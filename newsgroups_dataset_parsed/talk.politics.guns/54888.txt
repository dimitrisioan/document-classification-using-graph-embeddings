TEXT
OF
WHITE
HOUSE
ANNOUNCEMENT
AND
QAS
ON
CLIPPER
CHIP
ENCRYPTION
FOR
THOSE
WHO
DIDNT
FIGURE
IT
OUT
THE
BELOW
MESSAGE
WAS
A
REPLY
TO
ANOTHER
IN
SCICRYPT
FOR
WHICH
THE
POSTER
PUT
TPG
IN
THE
FOLLOWUPTO
LINE
I
DIDNT
NOTICE
THAT
APOLOGIES
TO
THOSE
WHO
WERE
CONFUSED
THE
SUBSTANCE
MAKES
LITTLE
SENSE
UNLESS
ONE
READS
THE
PRIOR
MESSAGES
HOWEVER
I
DONT
WISH
TO
ENTER
INTO
THIS
DISCUSSION
HERE
AS
IT
WILL
BE
YET
ANOTHER
REHEARSAL
OF
A
LONGTIRED
SET
OF
ARGUMENTS
SUFFICE
IT
TO
SAY
THAT
I
DISAGREE
BOTH
WITH
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
WELLREGULATED
IN
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
OFFERED
BY
GUN
LOVERS
AND
WHAT
I
THINK
TO
BE
THEIR
DISTORTION
OF
THE
SAME
PHRASE
IN
THE
ASSOCIATED
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
MY
WEBSTER
AND
MY
READING
OF
THE
LANGUAGE
CONVINCES
ME
THAT
THE
WORD
MEANT
BOTH
UNDER
CONTROL
AND
DISCIPLINED
AND
NOT
OF
GOOD
MARKSMANSHIP
I
THINK
THE
LATTER
A
SPECIAL
INTEREST
PLEADING
NO
ONE
HAS
YET
SHOWN
A
CONTEMPORATEOUS
REFERENCE
IN
WHICH
WELL
REGULATED
UNAMBIGUOUSLY
MEANT
OF
GOOD
MARKSMANSHIP
AND
NOT
UNDER
CONTROLDISCIPLINED
ETC
THUS
I
CONTINUE
TO
BELIEVE
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
IS
A
MILITIA
CLAUSE
AND
NOT
AN
ARMING
EVERYONE
CLAUSE
OTHERS
ARE
WELCOME
TO
DISAGREE
AS
I
KNOW
MANY
DO
AND
LITTLE
WOULD
BE
SERVED
BY
REHASHING
THIS
TOPIC
IN
THIS
PARTICULAR
FORUM

AVOID
FLAMES
OR
UNPRODUCTIVE
REHASHINGS

NOTE
THAT

I
AGREE
THIS

NOT
THE
PLACE

I
NOTE
IN

THAT
A
NUMBER
OF
