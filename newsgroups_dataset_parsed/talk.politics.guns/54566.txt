MORE
CAN
REASONABLY
BE
AIMED

THAN
TO
HAVE

IN

SEE
THAT

ALEXANDER
HAMILTON
FEDERALIST
PAPER
SPEAKING
OF
STANDING
ARMIES
IF
CIRCUMSTANCES
SHOULD
AT
ANY
TIME
OBLIGE
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
FORM
AN
ARMY
OF
ANY
MAGNITUDE
THAT
ARMY
CAN
NEVER
BE
FORMIDABLE
TO
THE
LIBERTIES
OF
THE

WHILE
THERE
IS
A
LARGE
BODY
OF
CITIZENS
LITTLE
IF
AT
ALL
INFERIOR
TO
THEM
IN
DISCIPLINE
AND
THE
USE
OF
ARMS
WHO
STAND
READY
TO
DEFEND
THEIR
OWN
RIGHTS
AND
THOSE
OF
THEIR
FELLOWCITIZENS
BUT
SURELY
HAMILTON
AND
MADISON
DIDNT
MEAN
THE
PEOPLE
WHEN
THEY
SAID
PEOPLE
RIGHT
THATS
WHY
THE
AMENDMENT
REFERS
TO
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
MILITIA
YOUR
AVERAGE
YEAR
OLD
MALE
DOES
NOT
FALL
INTO
THE
DEFINITION
YOURE
RIGHT
THE
MILITIA
CONSISTS
OF
ALL
ABLE
BODIED
MALES
AND
PROBABLY
FEMALES
UNDER
CURRENT
INTERPRETATION
THEREFORE
MOST
MEMBERS
OF
THE
MILITIA
THE
ONE
THE
EVERY
GUN
ADVOCATE
REFERS
TO
ARE
NOT
MEMBERS
OF
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
AND
THEREFORE
ARE
NOT
DIRECTLY
THE
AMENDMENT
DOES
NOR
REFER
TO
WELL
ORGANIZED
IT
SAYS
WELL
REGULATED
I
HAVE
SOME
TARGETS
YOU
MAY
EXAMINE
IF
YOU
WISH
TO
CHECK
HOW
WELL
REGULATED
I
AM
MENTIONED
IN
THE
AMENDMENT
IF
THIS
AMENDMENT
WANTED
TO
ALLOW
EVERY
MEMBER
OF
THE
MILITIA
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
WHY
DID
IT
SPECIFICLY
MENTION
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
IN
THE
SAME
SENTENCE
AS
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
CORRECT
THATS
WHY
THE
RIGHT
IS
RESERVED
TO
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THAT
WAS
TO
INSURE
THE
PEOPLE
COULD
FORM
A
WELL
REGULATED
MILITIA
NOT
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
IT
COULD
BE
ARGUED
THAT
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
SENTENCE
IS
SEPARATE
FROM
THE
LAST
PART
IF
SO
WHY
WAS
IT
INCLUDE
IN
THE
SAME
ATOMIC
UNIT
OF
WRITTEN
WHAT
DO
ATOMIC
UNITS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
THIS
ARGUMENT
ANY
MORON
CAN
SET
HBAR
C
INSTEAD
OF
A
SEPARATE
SENTENCE
OH
I
SEE
WHAT
YOUR
QUESTION
IS
WHY
DONT
YOU
READ
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
JAMES
MADISON
FEDERALIST
PAPER
REGARDING
THE
GENERAL
WELFARE
CLAUSE
NOTHING
IS
MORE
NATURAL
NOR
COMMON
THAN
FIRST
TO
USE
A
GENERAL
PHRASE
AND
THEN
TO
EXPLAIN
AND
QUALIFY
IT
BY
A
RECITAL
OF
PARTICULARS
BUT
WHAT
DOES
MADISON
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
GRAMMATICAL
STYLE
OF
THE
HE
ONLY
WROTE
IT
THE
AMENDMENT
ALSO
IMPLIES
THAT
THE
RIGHT
TO
ARMS
HAS
TO
DUE
WITH
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
FREE
STATE
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
MENTION
OF
A
WELL
REGULATED
MILITIA
GIVES
MANY
EXAMPLES
OF
HOW
THIS
MILITIA
PROTECTS
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
FREE
STATE
ALL
THESE
EXAMPLES
ARE
ACTIONS
OF
A
VERY
ORGANIZED
FORCE
NOT
SOME
JOHN
Q
PUBLIC
WITH
A
GUN
THATS
OBVIOUSLY
BECAUSE
YOUVE
NEVER
ACTUALLY
READ
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
ALL
THAT
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
CLEARLY
STATES
TO
ME
IS
THAT
THE
PEOPLES
RIGHT
TO
FORM
WELL
REGULATED
MILITIAS
SHALL
NOT
BE
INFRINGED
THAT
IS
PEOPLE
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
JOIN
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
THIS
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
WILL
OF
COURSE
PROVIDE
TRAINING
IN
HOW
TO
USE
ARMS
AND
IN
BASIC
MILITARY
TACTICS
THESE
TRAINING
MEMBERS
OF
THE
MILITIA
CAN
KEEP
AND
BEAR
THE
ARMS
CANT
READ
HUH
SHOW
ME
WHERE
THE
DOCUMENT
SAYS
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
LASTLY
READING
THROUGH
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
ON
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
IT
IS
VERY
CLEAR
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
REASONS
FOR
THESE
MILITIAS
ONE
REASON
STATED
IS
THE
PROTECTION
FROM
A
STANDING
ARMY
THESE
DAYS
THE
STANDING
ARMY
COULD
EASILY
DEFEAT
A
GROUP
CONSISTING
OF
EVERY
YEAR
OLD
MALE
AND
FEMALE
NOT
IN
THE
ARMIED
FORCES
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHY
EVERY
PERSON
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
OWN
ANY
WEAPON
CURRENTLY
IN
USE
IN
THE
ARMED
FORCES
ANOTHER
REASON
STATED
FOR
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIAS
IS
TO
REDUCED
THE
NEED
FOR
A
STANDING
ARMY
WELL
THE
US
ARMIED
FORCES
HAVE
BEEN
A
STANDING
ARMY
FOR
MORE
THAN
HALF
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
US
BUT
THE
MAJOR
REASON
IS
TO
PROTECT
AGAINST
THAT
VERY
SAME
ARMY
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THE
WHOLE
REASON
FOR
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
TO
GIVE
THE
PEOPLE
PROTECTION
FROM
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
BY
GUARANTEEING
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
CAN
OVER
THROUGH
THE
GOVERNMENT
IF
NECESSARY
IS
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
AN
ANACHRONISM
IS
THIS

AND

MAYBE
ITS

RETHINK
HOW
THIS
