did
anyone
notice
that
clinton
was
smiling
and
making
jokes
just
before
this
press
conference
considering
the
number
of
people
killed
this
seems
very
inappropriate
to
me
or
did
anyone
notice
that
when
clinton
referred
to
the
davidians
as
religious
fanatics
that
a
round
of
spontaneous
applause
burst
forth
from
the
reporters
to
me
this
was
not
only
in
poor
taste
but
it
showed
the
medias
bias
and
hostility
to
anyone
not
of
the
politically
correct
stripe
no
wonder
they
have
been
cheerleading
for
the
kgbatf
and
the
fbi
during
this
whole
affair
rod
it
collectivism
vs
individualism
is
an
ancient
conflict
men
have
come
close
to
the
truth
but
it
was
destroyed
each
time
and
one
civilization
fell
after
another
civilization
is
the
progress
toward
a
society
of
privacy
the
savages
whole
existence
is
public
ruled
by
the
laws
of
his
tribe
civilization
is
the
process
of
setting
man
free
from
men
ayn
rand
roarks
speech
from

fountainhead
i
dont
speak
for
my
company
we
hire
the
politically
correct
to
do
that
