DID
ANYONE
NOTICE
THAT
CLINTON
WAS
SMILING
AND
MAKING
JOKES
JUST
BEFORE
THIS
PRESS
CONFERENCE
CONSIDERING
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
KILLED
THIS
SEEMS
VERY
INAPPROPRIATE
TO
ME
OR
DID
ANYONE
NOTICE
THAT
WHEN
CLINTON
REFERRED
TO
THE
DAVIDIANS
AS
RELIGIOUS
FANATICS
THAT
A
ROUND
OF
SPONTANEOUS
APPLAUSE
BURST
FORTH
FROM
THE

SHOWED
THE
MEDIAS
BIAS

COLLECTIVISM

INDIVIDUALISM

AN
ANCIENT
CONFLICT
MEN
HAVE
COME
CLOSE
TO
THE
TRUTH
BUT
IT
WAS
DESTROYED
EACH
TIME
AND
ONE
CIVILIZATION
FELL
AFTER
ANOTHER
CIVILIZATION
IS
THE
PROGRESS
TOWARD
A
SOCIETY
OF
PRIVACY
THE
SAVAGES
WHOLE
EXISTENCE
IS
PUBLIC
RULED
BY
THE
LAWS
OF
HIS
TRIBE
CIVILIZATION
IS
THE
PROCESS
OF
SETTING
MAN
FREE
