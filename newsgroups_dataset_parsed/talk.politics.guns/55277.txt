i
want
to
see
an
independent
investigation
with
full
prosecuting
and
subpoena
powers
with
felony
prosecution
where
felony
acts
are
found
fat
chance
i
bet
i
bet
the
justice
dept
will
have
an
internal
investigation
which
will
turn
up
at
most
poor
judgement
ooohhhhhhhh
can
you
say
independent
prosecutor
geee
maybe
ol
mr
walsh
can
do
something
useful
after
all
right
fat
chance
im
responding
at
the
risk
of
misreading
your
response
but
i
do
have
to
tell
my
fellow
conservatives
to
give
it
up
attacking
renoclintonatffbi
they
may
have
botched
an
operation
but
they
didnt
kill
anybody
who
never
shot
at
them
first
david
koresh
was
a
frigging
lunatic
his
followers
had
the
combined
iq
of
a
geraldo
audience
the
kids
probably
would
have
been
those
fucked
up
social
rejects
who
go
to
freshman
dances
in
high
school
never
to
be
seen
again
except
maybe
in
the
band
until
prom
when
they
show
up
like
animals
boarding
the
ark
then
its
bowling
till
in
the
morning
whywhy
did
it
happen
to
me
anyway
the
point
is
janet
renobill
clinton
were
only
following
the
advice
of
trained
law
enforcement
officials
who
were
experts
in
their
fields
id
rather
have
our
leaders
do
that
then
micromanage
every
crisis
that
comes
along
then
youd
really
see
trouble
no
matter
what
party
or
ideology
the
president
and
her
er
i
mean
his
attorney
general
is
ryan
