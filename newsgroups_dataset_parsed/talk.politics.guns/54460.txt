all

bills
are
dead
senate
file
dealing
with
offduty
police
officers
carrying
concealed
remains
viable
the
power
of
the
word
processor
and
a
stamp
at
work
the
fact
that
around
here
the
state
rep
generally
lives
no
more
than
nine
miles
from
any
constituent
doesnt
hurt

does
anyone
know
the
particulars
on
the
senate

does
this
bill
allow
or
deny
offduty
police
from
carrying
concealed
from
what
information
that
i
have
iowa
has
a
discretionary
permit
policy
on
ccw
if
s
allows
policeoffduty
to
carry
concealed
then
i
would
be
inclined
to
oppose
it
i
dont
believe
offduty
police
officers
should
have
any
more
rights
than
civilians
if
law
or
policy
prevents
lawabiding
citizens
from
being
armed
for
self
defense
then
why
should
offduty
police
officer
be
treated
any
differently
