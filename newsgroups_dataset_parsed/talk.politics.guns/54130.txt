RE
THE
PILL
FOR
DEER
NO
HUNTING
JRMGNVIFASUFLEDU
WRITES
PROMISING
FIELD
EXPERIMENTS
ARE
BEING
DONE
THIS
YEAR
IN
SEVERAL
AREAS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
RELATING
TO
CHEMICAL
CONTRACEPTIVE
BAITS
FOR
DEER
PRELIMINARY
DATA
SUGGESTS
THAT
THIS
WILL
BE
A
COSTEFFECTIVE
AND
HUMANE
METHOD
FOR
PREVENTING
OVERPOPULATION
OF
HABITATS
PRELIMINARY
DATA
REGARDING
SIMILAR
RESEARCH
INTO
KANGAROO
OVERPOPULATION
IN
AUSTRALIA
DO
NOT
IN
ANY
WAY
SUPPORT
THE
COSTEFFECTIVENESS
OF
THIS
APPROACH
IT
MAY
BE
COSTEFFECTIVE
FOR
DEERIF
YOU
QUIETLY
OVERLOOK
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
NET
COST
TO
THE
STATE
OF
DEER
HUNTING
IS
NEGATIVE
IE
A
PROFIT
BECAUSE
THE
MAJORITY
OF
HUNTERS
PAY
FOR
LICENCES
THE
COST
COMPARISONS
ARE
PROBABLY
BEING
DONE
ASSUMING
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
TO
BE
EMPLOYED
TO
CULL
THE
ANIMALS
WHICH
IS
NOT
IN
FACT
THE
CASE
YOU
FIGURE
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
PAY
FOR
LICENCES
TO
IMPLANT
CONTRACEPTIVE
PELLETS
OR
SPREAD
BAITS
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
FAIR
BIT
OF
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
THIS
HERE
RECENTLY
BECAUSE
THE
KANGAROO
POPULATION
IN
THE
GROUNDS
OF
THE
GOVERNOR
GENERALS
RESIDENCE
HAS
NOW
REACHED
PLAGUE
PROPORTIONS
DESPITE
THE
WHINES
OF
THE
RAMPANT
ANIMALLIBBERS
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
METHOD
OF
CONTROLLING
THE
POPULATION
IS
STILL
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
CONTROLLED
SHOOTING
SO
NOW
WHY
SHOULD
WE
ALLOW
HUNTING
TO
PREVENT
OVERPOPULATION
OF
THE
DEERBEARWHATEVER
SORRY
BUT
THAT
JUSTIFICATION
OF
BLOOD
LUST
IS
NOW
GONE
WITH
THE
WIND
ONCE
MASSPRODUCTION
OF
THIS
STUFF
BEGINS
ANIMAL
POPULATIONS
CAN
BE
EASILY
MANAGED
WITHOUT
A
SHOT
BEING
FIRED
THIS
LEAVES
ONLY
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
LIKE
TO
GO
OUT
IN
THE
WOODS
AND
KILL
THINGS
SOME
PEOPLE
TAKE
SATISFACTION
IMHO
LEGITIMATE
SATISFACTION
IN
EATING
FOOD
THAT
THEY
HAVE
HARVESTED
THEMSELVES
THE
PLEASURE
DERIVED
FROM
HUNTING
IS
THE
SAME
AS
THAT
YOU
GET
FROM
EATING
FRUIT
AND
VEGETABLES
GROWN
IN
YOUR
OWN
GARDEN
AND
IN
GENERAL
GAME
MEAT
IS
PROBABLY
MUCH
FREER
OF
UNPLEASANT
CHEMICALS
THAN
WHAT
YOU
BUY
FROM
THE
BUTCHER
OR
THE
SUPERMARKET
THAT
MAY
BE
A
MOTIVATION
BUT
IT
CANNOT
NOW
BE
JUSTIFIED
EXPECT
PETA
AND
LIKE
ORGANIZATIONS
TO
USE
THIS
ARGUMENT
TO
GET
HUNTING
BANNED
PERIOD
BY
CANNOT
NOW
BE
JUSTIFIED
I
GUESS
YOU
MEAN
THAT
YOU
PERSONALLY
DONT
SEE
ANY
JUSTIFICATION
FINEBUT
WHAT
MAKES
YOUR
OPINION
SO
IMPORTANT
WITH
NO
LEGITIMATE
HUNTING
WITH
THE
PAPERS
FILLED
WITH
STORIES
OF
SENSELESS
MURDERS
I
GUESS
THERE
WONT
BE
A
CHANCE
IN
HELL
OF
BUILDING
A
CASE
FOR
THE
RKBA
THAT
WILL
WITHSTAND
EITHER
PUBLIC
OPINION
NECESSITY
OR
SCIENTIFIC
SCRUTINY
DONT
GIVE
ME
THAT
SILENT
MAJORITY
WANTS
GUNS
CRAP
THEY
ARE
AND
WILL
BE
SILENT
NO
VOTES
FOR
RKBA
NO
RKBA
CERTAINLY
THE
LAST
POINT
IS
CORRECT
IF
POLITICIANS
DONT
SEE
ANY
VOTES
FOR
THEMSELVES
IN
OPPOSING
STUPID
LEGISLATION
OR
IN
DEVELOPING
AND
SUPPORTING
MEASURES
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
EFFECTIVE
IN
REDUCING
THE
INCIDENCE
OF
VIOLENT
CRIME
THEY
WONT
DO
