DANIEL
OLDHAM
BABBLES
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WACO
IS
NOT
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
BATF
IF
THEY
WOULD
OF
HAD
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PERSONAL
THEN
THEY
COULD
OF
CAPTURED
THE
COMPOUND
ON
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
AND
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
OF
HAPPENED
IF
THEYD
GONE
TO
THE
DOOR
AND
KNOCKED
ON
IT
TO
SERVE
THE
WARRANT
LIKE
THE
SHERIFF
HAD
DONE
OTHER
TIMES
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
NEEDED
TO
HAVE
AN
INITIAL
ASSAULT
BUT
THEN
HERR
KLINTON
AND
ATTORNEY
GENL
RENO
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
HAVE
TOLD
SUCH
HEROIC
STORIES
ABOUT
HOW
THEY
PROTECTED
THE
REST
OF
US
FROM
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
KEPT
TO
THEMSELVES
MILES
OUT
IN
THE
PRAIRIE
THE
BATF
NEEDS
MORE
PEOPLE
BETTER
WEAPONS
AND
MORE
ARMORED
TRANSPORTS
WHEN
THEY
MEET
HOSTILE
FIRE
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
MORE
FORCE
INSTEAD
OF
RETREATING
TO
A
STAND
OFF
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
A
JOB
THEN
DO
IT
RIGHT
THE
BATF
IS
THERE
TO
PROTECT
US
AND
THEY
MUST
HAVE
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PEOPLE
TO
DO
THE
JOB
THE
BATF
NEEDS
TO
BE
DISBANDED
THIS
OUT
OF
CONTROL
GROUP
OF
RAMBO
WANNABEES
IS
A
DANGER
TO
THE
REPUBLIC
WITH
THE
WOD
AND
THE
INCREASED
CRIME
IN
THE
STREETS
THE
BATF
IS
NEEDED
MORE
NOW
THEN
EVER
IF
THEY
BLAST
AWAY
A
FEW
GOOD
FOKES
THEN
THAT
IS
THE
PRICE
WE
ALL
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
LAW
AND
ORDER
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
WELL
I
FIGURE
YOURE
GOING
TO
GET
FLAMED
PRETTY
BADLY
BY
EVERYBODY
ELSE
FOR
THIS
INCREDIBLY
STUPID
STATEMENT
SO
ILL
JUST
LET
IT
PASS
FOR
NOW
CASE
WESTERN
RESERVE
HUH
DO
THE
FEDS
KNOW
ABOUT
THAT
BIG
STOCKPILE
OF
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
AND
CRACK
YOU
HAVE
IN
YOUR
HOUSE
ARE
YOU
THE
SAME
DANIEL
OLDHAM
THAT
LIVES
ON
ORCHARD
DRIVE
JUST
SO
THEY
GET
THE
ADDRESS
RIGHT
THAT
IS
LOOK
AT
ALL
THE
GOOD
PEOPLE
THAT
DIED
IN
WARS
TO
PROTECT
THIS
GREAT
COUNTRY
OF
OURS
WELL
IT
USED
TO
BE
A
GREAT
COUNTRY
NOW
IM
NOT
SO
SURE
I
KNEW
A
FEW
OF
THOSE
GOOD
PEOPLE
WHO
DIED
IN
WARS
I
WAS
IN
VIET
NAM
I
CAN
ASSURE
YOU
NONE
OF
US
FOUGHT
TO
PROTECT
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
ATTACK
ITS
OWN
CITIZENS
WITH
MILITARY
FORCE
WITHOUT
PROVOCATION
HINT
SERVING
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
PROVOCATION
TO
STAGE
A
MILITARY
STYLE
ASSAULT
ON
A
RELIGIOUS
GROUP
AT
LEAST
NOT
HERE
IN
THE
US
MAYBE
IN
IRAQ
OR
SYRIA
WITH
THE
ARMS
BUILD
UP
IN
WACO
THEY
NEEDED
TO
HIT
THAT
COMPOUND
WITH
MEGA
FIRE
POWER
THEY
COULD
OF
GONE
IN
THERE
BLASTING
AND
KILLED
A
FEW
WOMEN
AND
KIDS
BUT
IT
WOULD
OF
BEEN
BETTER
THEN
LETTING
THEM
ALL
BURN
TO
DEATH
DAYS
LATER
THIS
IS
A
JOKE
RIGHT
OR
ARE
THEY
REALLY
LETTING
FOOLS
LIKE
YOU
INTO
CWRU
NOW
TOO
BAD
USED
TO
BE
A
GOOD
SCHOOL
HOWD
YOU
GET
IN
ANYWAY
DID
YOUR
OLD
MAN
BUY
A
NEW
WING
FOR
THE
LIBRARY
