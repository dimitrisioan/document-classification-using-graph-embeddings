RE
WHOS
NEXT
MORMONS
AND
JEWS
THIS
IS
A
STRETCH
IN
FACT
A
GREAT
MANY
OF
THE
PERSECUTED
INDIANS
WERE
CHRISTIAN
A
GREAT
MANY
IT
WOULD
BE
SIMPLER
TO
STATE
THE
OBVIOUS
THAT
WHITE
PEOPLE
WANTED
LAND
THE
INDIANS
DOMINATED
OR
THREATENED
I
REALLY
DONT
THINK
THE
GOVERNMENT
CARED
A
HILL
OF
BEANS
ABOUT
THE
INDIANS
RELIGION
MY
NATIVE
AMERICAN
GIRLFRIEND
ASKS
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
REALLY
DOESNT
CARE
A
HILL
OF
BEANS
ABOUT
OUR
RELIGION
HOW
COME
THEYRE
STILL
BUSTING
US
FOR
IT
IN
OREGON
WASHINGTON
AND
A
FEW
OTHER
PLACES
YOUD
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
TOO
IF
THE
US
ARMY
MARCHED
YOU
INTO
CHURCH
AT
GUNPOINT
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THE
INDIANS
WHO
BECAME
CHRISTIANS
DID
SO
BECAUSE
THE
US
ARMY
MARCHED
THEM
INTO
CHURCH
AT
GUNPOINT
THIS
WILL
BE
NEWS
TO
THE
INDIANS
OF
THE
GREAT
LAKES
AND
UPPER
MISSISSIPPI
BASIN
OF
THE
SOUTHWEST
OF
MEXICO
AND
SOUTH
AMERICA
WHO
CONVERTED
EVEN
BEFORE
THERE
WAS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
THE
US
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
INDIANS
ARE
INCAPABLE
OF
COMING
TO
A
DECISION
THEMSELVES
ABOUT
THEIR
RELIGION
WITHOUT
BEING
FORCED
TO
AT
GUNPOINT
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
CHRISTIAN
CHEROKEES
WHO
WERE
GIVEN
THE
BOOT
BY
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
AFTER
THE
CIVIL
WAR
BECAUSE
THE
CHEROKEE
NATION
GAVE
MILD
SUPPORT
TO
THE
CONFEDERACY
SINCE
THEY
THEMSELVES
OWNED
BLACK
SLAVES
NO
REDUCING
IT
ALL
TO
A
MATTER
OF
RELIGION
IS
TO
SUPPORT
A
MUCH
TOO
NARROW
VIEW
OF
HISTORY
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
A
SINGLE
TREATY
WHETHER
BROKEN
BY
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
OR
NOT
WERE
ANY
NOT
THAT
SAID
IF
YOU
GUYS
CONVERT
TO
CHRISTIANITY
YOU
GET
TO
KEEP
ALL
THE
LAND
YOU
CLAIM
NO
TREATIES
WERE
INVARIABLY
ABOUT
LAND
IT
MEANT
CEDING
INDIAN
CLAIMS
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
SOMETIMES
IN
RETURN
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
PROMISED
THE
HUNTERGATHERER
TRIBES
AND
PLENTY
OF
TRIBES
WERE
ALREADY
FARMING
FOR
CENTURIES
BUT
WE
DONT
HEAR
ABOUT
NONPLAINS
INDIANS
IN
MOVIES
FOOD
AND
TRAINING
IN
RETURN
FOR
TAKING
UP
A
NONNOMADIC
EXISTENCE
PROMISES
OF
