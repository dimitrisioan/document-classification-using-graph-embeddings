RE
BOSTON
GUN
BUY
BACK
RON
MILLER
WROTE
WHEN
YOU
ASK
THE
QUESTION
OF
THE
AUTHORITIES
OR
SPONSORS
OF
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WHETHER
THEY
WILL
CHECK
FOR
STOLEN
WEAPONS
AND
THEY
ANSWER
NO
ITS
TOTAL
AMNESTY
GOOD
POINT
ABOUT
REGISTRATION
SCHEMES
BEING
USED
ONLY
FOR
HARASSMENT
DELETED
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THIS
IS
RECEIVING
STOLEN
PROPERTY
AND
IS
NO
DIFFERENT
THAN
A
PAWN
SHOP
OWNER
DOING
THE
SAME
THING
MYRON
PETRO
NRA
USPSA
DVC
YALL
THE
OPINIONS
INCLUDED
IN
THIS
POST
ARE
MY
SOLE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
ARE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
AND
GUARNTEED
BY
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
IF
AMNESTY
WAS
THEIR
CONCERN
THEY
SHOULD
PAY
IN
CASH
RATHER
THAN
MONEYORDER
AND
THEY
SHOULD
CHECK
TO
SEE
IF
THE
GUN
TURNED
IN
WAS
STOLEN
OR
NOT
THIS
WAY
IF
A
GUN
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
STOLEN
THEN
EVEN
IF
THEY
WANTED
TO
PROSECUTE
THEY
DONT
KNOW
WHO
TO
PROSECUTE
SINCE
THE
ONLY
CONCERN
OF
THESEHCI
AND
THE
LIKE
PEOPLE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
TOTAL
ERADICATION
OF
GUNS
LEGAL
OR
ILLEGAL
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
BOTHER
TO
CHECK
FOR
STOLEN
PROPERTY
IF
THEY
KNEW
WHO
THE
RIGHTFUL
OWNER
IS
THEN
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
RETURN
THE
GUN
AND
HENCE
CONTRARY
TO
THEIR
INTENT
TO
BAN
ALL
GUNS
