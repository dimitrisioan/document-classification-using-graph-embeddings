STUFF
DELETED
ABOUT
CAUSES
OF
PEOPLE
IN
ER
DUE
TO
AUTOMOBILE
ACCIDENTS
AND
AUTOMOBILE
CRIMES
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
OUTLAW
CARS
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
AUTOMOBILE
ACCIDENTS
BUT
ATLEAST
THERE
IS
SOME
REGULATION
TO
TRY
TO
COMBAT
THIS
SUCH
AS
DRUNK
DRIVERS
GET
BACK
ON
THE
ROAD
IN
NO
TIME
TO
KILL
AGAIN
SEEMS
THE
DRIVERS
LICENSE
PROCESS
DOES
NOT
WORK
FOR
THIS
I
CAN
TESTIFY
TO
THIS
MY
COUSIN
SPENT
A
FEW
WEEKS
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
AND
HIS
FRIEND
WAS
KILLED
BECAUSE
OF
A
DRUNK
DRIVER
THE
SONOFAB
IS
BACK
ON
THE
STREETS
OFFICERS
FROM
THE
SCENE
ARE
STILL
PED
ABOUT
THAT
ONE
TO
TAKE
A
DRIVERS
SAFETY
CLASS
BECAUSE
YOU
WANTED
ONE
WHILE
YOU
WERE
UNDERAGE
I
HAVE
TO
BE
LICENSED
TO
DRIVE
ONLY
ON
PUBLIC
ROADS
MY
CAR
MUST
BE
REGISTERED
ONLY
IF
IT
IS
TO
BE
DRIVEN
ON
PUBLIC
ROADS
OTHER
THAN
BETWEEN
SEGMENTS
OF
MY
PROPERTY
I
MUST
AT
LEAST
WHERE
I
LIVE
HAVE
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
ON
BOTH
MYSELF
DRIVING
AND
MY
CAR
IF
SOMEONE
ELSE
HAD
AN
ACCIDENT
WITH
IT
ONLY
ON
PUBLIC
ROADS
AND
THIS
OBVIOUSLY
DOESNT
ALWAYS
WORK
ELSE
WHY
WOULD
THEY
OFFER
UNINSURED
MOTORIST
COVERAGE
HMM
WOULDNT
MANDITORY
SAFTEY
CLASSES
REGISTRATION
OF
BOTH
THE
OWNER
AND
GUN
AND
MANDITORY
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
BE
NICE
FOR
GUN
OWNERS
I
OBJECT
TO
MANDATORY
REGISTRATION
BECAUSE
I
DONT
TRUST
MY
GOVERNMENT
NOT
TO
USE
ANY
INFORMATION
I
GIVE
THEM
FOR
THEIR
OWN
PURPOSES
I
AM
LICENSED
TO
CARRY
A
CONCEALED
PISTOL
IN
MY
HOME
STATE
BUT
THEY
NEVER
ASKED
WHETHER
I
ACTUALLY
OWNED
A
FIREARM
A
SAFETY
CLASS
BEFORE
ISSUING
A
PERMIT
TO
CARRY
IS
REASONABLY
PROVIDED
SUCH
CLASSES
ARE
REGULARLY
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
PUBLIC
OF
COURSE
MOST
PLACES
WOULD
CONSIDER
MY
TIME
IN
THE
RESERVES
AND
ON
A
COMPETITION
RIFLE
TEAM
TO
COUNT
PERHAPS
IF
IT
GAVE
THEM
PERMISSION
TO
SHOOT
IN
PUBLIC
ROADS
AND
PARKS
HEY
NOW
THATS
AN
IDEA
PAUL
REIMER
JIM
NOW
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
AN
AGENDA
AGAINST
PRIVATE
OWNERSHIP
OF
FIREARMS
WHY
WOULD
YOU
WANT
TO
HARASS
THE
PERSON
TRYING
TO
LEGALLY
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
OR
EXERCISE
THEIR
RIGHTS
I
KNOW
DEFENDING
ONESELFFAMILYWHOEVER
IS
A
RIGHT
AT
LEAST
AS
FAR
AS
MY
AND
I
ARE
CONCERNED
ALSO
AS
FAR
AS
THE
STATE
OF
ALABAMA
SEEMS
TO
BE
CONCERNED
WHY
DONT
YOU
PUSH
FOR
STRICTER
PROSECUTION
OF
THOSE
WHO
USE
FIREARMS
IN
THE
COMMISSION
OF
A
CRIME
IVE
ALREADY
POINTED
OUT
HOW
WE
ARENT
NAILING
DUIS
HARD
ENOUGH
COMPARING
THE
US
WITH
OTHER
COUNTRIES
SELDOM
WORKS
BUT
THE
EUROPEAN
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
ALCHOHOL
AND
DUI
SEEMS
TO
WORK
THEIR
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
WEAPONS
ISNT
REALLY
A
VALID
COMPARISON
BECAUSE
THEYVE
HISTORICALLY
DONE
THEIR
BEST
TO
KEEP
THE
POPULACE
DISARMED
AND
SUBMISSIVE
WHILE
OUR
COUNTRY
WAS
FOUNDED
BY
A
BUNCH
OF
RUGGED
INDIVIDUALISTS
WHO
TOLD
THE
EUROPEAN
MONARCHIES
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
TO
TAKE
A
FLYING
LEAP
USED
MORE
POLITE
LANGUAGE
THOUGH
WE
EVEN
WEASELED
OUT
OF
OUR
FIRST
INTERNATIONAL
TREATY
AND
THEN
CONVINCED
THE
FRENCH
THAT
IT
WAS
IN
THEIR
BEST
INTERESTS
NOT
TO
COMPLAIN
BUT
FIRST
WE
HAD
TO
OVERCOME
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
BRITS
WERE
DOING
THEIR
BEST
TO
RESTRICT
US
TO
SQUIRREL
GUNS
AND
SUCH
SO
WED
BE
PROPERLY
SUBMISSIVE
WHILE
THEY
FORCED
US
TO
PAY
FOR
THEIR
WARS
OF
COURSE
MOST
AMERICAN
HISTORY
CLASSES
THESE
DAYS
TEND
TO
GLOSS
OVER
FACTS
THAT
DO
NOT
FIT
THE
IMAGE
THEY
WISH
TO
CONVEY
IM
GLAD
MY
AMER
HIST
TEACHER
WAS
A
LIBERTARIAN
WHO
HAD
US
REVIEW
A
GOOD
PORTION
OF
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
AND
DEBATE
THEIR
ORIGINS
AND
MEANINGS
