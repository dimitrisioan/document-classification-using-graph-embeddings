RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE
THOMAS
PARSLI
THOMASPIFIUIONO
WRITES
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE
FIGURES
EXACTLY
BUT
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
DEATHS
IN
TEXAS
IN
THAT
WAS
CAUSED
BY
GUNS
THIS
IS
MORE
THAN
THOSE
BEEING
KILLED
IN
CARACCIDENTS
YES
THERE
COULD
BE
THAT
LOW
SENTENCES
OR
HIGH
POVERTY
COULD
INFLUENCE
THE
FIGURES
BUT
THEYRE
STILL
PRETTY
HIGH
RIGHT
I
ALSO
BELIEVE
TEXAS
HAS
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
LIBERAL
GUNLAWS
IN
USA
AND
YOUD
BE
WRONG
ABOUT
THAT
TOO
NOTE
THAT
TEXAS
ISNT
UNIQUE
IN
THIS
MORE
WITHGUN
DEATHS
THAN
WITHCAR
DEATHS
BUT
SOME
OF
THE
OTHER
STATES
WHERE
IT
HAPPENS
HAVE
EXTREMELY
STRICT
GUN
LAWS
OOPS
SO
MUCH
FOR
THE
MEANING
IT
ISNT
CLEAR
THAT
THE
COMPARISION
MEANS
ANYTHING
ANYWAY
AS
CAR
ACCIDENTS
ARE
UNINTENTIONAL
WHILE
GUN
DEATHS
ARENT
BUT
IF
WERE
GOING
TO
MAKE
IT
LETS
AT
LEAST
BE
HONEST
I
SHOULD
NOT
SUFFER
BECAUSE
OF
OTHERS
WE
ALL
AGREE
ON
THIS
ONE
BUT
WE
ALSO
LIVE
IN
A
SOCIATY
AND
THEREFOR
WELL
HAVE
TO
GIVE
UP
SOME
OF
OUR
FREEDOM
NOTE
THE
GIVE
IT
UP
FOR
WHAT
GUN
CONTROL
DOESNT
HAVE
ANY
BENEFITS
SO
IT
FAILS
BY
THIS
STANDARD
DO
YOU
HAVE
AN
INSURANCE
THEN
YOULL
HAVE
TO
PAY
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
OTHERS
DO
NOTE
THAT
INSURANCE
GIVES
ME
SOMETHING
IN
RETURN
GUN
CONTROL
DOESNT
WHAT
THE
HELL
IS
HE
TRYING
TO
SAY
WHEN
YOU
LIVE
IN
A
SOCIETY
USA
ARE
STILLL
COUNTED
AS
ONE
YOU
HAVE
TO
SACCRIFICE
THE
QUESTION
IS
HOW
MUCH
THATS
HALF
THE
QUESTION
THE
REST
IS
AND
WHAT
DO
YOU
GET
FOR
YOUR
SACRIFICE
IF
THE
ANSWER
TO
THE
SECOND
QUESTION
IS
NOTHING
AS
IT
IS
FOR
GUN
CONTROL
THEN
WE
DONT
HAVE
TO
ASK
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
BECAUSE
GETTING
NOTHING
MEANS
THAT
NO
SACRIFICE
IS
JUSTIFIED
ANDY
