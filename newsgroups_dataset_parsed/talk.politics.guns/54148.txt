firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
why
either
the
numerator
or
the
denominator
could
fluctuate
the
dollar
value
of
a
gun
would
of
course
go
up
if
supply
were
restricted
the
weight
of
a
gun
might
go
down
significantly
as
technology
improved
i
dont
think
you
have
a
basis
to
assert
this
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
all
production
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
firearms
from
scratch
the
skill
is
easily
taught
to
anyone
with
a
modicum
of
mechanical
aptitude
and
the
only
motivator
needed
is
money
if
guns
were
banned
then
this
motivator
would
kick
in
big
time
now
of
course
it
is
not
a
moneymaking
proposition
for
every
machine
shop
to
make
guns
on
the
side
when
it
aint
rebuilding
engines
ban
guns
and
watch
what
happens
youll
have
to
schedule
a
year
in
advance
to
get
your
brakes
resurfaced
