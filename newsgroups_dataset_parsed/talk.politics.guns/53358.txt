YES
I
AM
PROGUN
AND
YES
I
DO
DISAGREE
WITH
THIS
STATEMENT
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
IN
AND
OF
THEMSELVES
ARE
DANGEROUS
RADIOACTIVE
DECAY
OF
PLUTONIUM
AND
URANIUM
AS
WELL
AS
THE
TRITIUM
IN
THE
WEAPON
TENDS
TO
BE
SOMEWHAT
DANGEROUS
TO
LIVING
THINGS
CAN
YOU
SAY
NEUTRON
FLUX
CAN
YOU
SAY
I
GET
MORE
BACKGROUND
RADIATION
FROM
LIVING
IN
DENVER
OR
HAVING
AN
OFFICE
IN
A
LIMESTONE
BUILDING
THAN
I
DO
STANDING
NEXT
TO
A
POWER
REACTOR
AT
FULL
POWER
OR
STANDING
NEXT
TO
A
NUCLEAR
WARHEAD
THAT
IS
ARMED
LOOK
UP
SHIELDING
IN
YOUR
DICTIONARY
YOU
DONT
NEED
SIX
FEET
OF
LEAD
TO
MAKE
DECENT
SHIELDING
YOUR
DEAD
SKIN
CELL
LAYER
DOES
AN
EXCELLENT
JOB
ON
ALPHA
PARTICLES
AND
NEUTRONS
ARE
SLOWED
BY

WATER
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
OF
YOU
IS
BUT
WHATEVER
THE
NEUTRONS
HIT
HAS
A
GOOD
CHANCE
OF
ABSORBING
THE
NEUTRON
AND
BECOMING
RADIOACTIVE
ITSELF
MOSTLY
THAT
MEANS
WATER
TURNING
INTO
HARMLESS
HEAVY
WATER
BUT
SOME
NEUTRONS
WOULD
ALSO
HIT
BONES
AND
THE
RESULTING
HARMFULL
SECONDARD
RADIOACTIVES
WOULD
REMAIN
IN
THE
BODY
FOR
DECADES
I
THINK
AN
UNSHIELDED
NUCLEAR
WARHEAD
COULD
REASONABLY
BE
CONSIDERED
A
PUBLIC
HEALTH
HAZARD
AS
FOR
A
SHIELDED
WARHEAD
I
THINK
A
FAIR
AMOUNT
OF
MAINTAINCE
IS
REQUIRED
FOR
IT
TO
REMAIN
SAFELY
SHIELDED
EG
STORAGE
IN
A
DRY
TEMPERATUREREGULATED
FACILITY
ETC
FOR
PRIVATE
OWNERSHIP
TO
BE
UNREGULATED
I
THINK
A
SINGLE
INDIVIDUAL
MUST
BE
ABLE
NOT
ONLY
TO
KEEP
THE
WEAPON
BUT
KEEP
IT
IN
A
SAFE
CONDITION
IF
ANY
RANDOM
PRIVATE
CITIZEN
COULD
NOT
PROPERLY
KEEP
MAINTAIN
AND
STORE
A
NUCLEAR
WEAPON
THEN
SOME
REGULATION
IS
CLEARLY
APPROPRIATE
PLUS
THESE
THINGS
HAVE
NO
SELF
DEFENSE
PURPOSES
ITS
KINDA
HARD
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
USE
AS
A
MILITIA
WEAPON
WHEN
AT
BEST
THEY
ARE
MEANT
FOR
BATTLEFIELD
USE
LOWYIELD
WEAPONS
OR
AT
WORST
FOR
INDUSTRIAL
TARGET
OBLITERATION
TRANSLATION
CITIES
AND
POPULATION
CENTERS
IF
THE
MILITIA
HAS
AS
ITS
JOB
THE
OVERTHROW
OF
AN
ILLEGAL
GOVERNMENT
THEY
ARE
INDEED
USEFUL
WEAPONS
TO
THE
MILITIA
I
DISAGREE
WITH
THIS
PURPOSE
THE
JOB
OF
THE
MILITIA
IS
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
AND
THEIR
COMMUNITY
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
AMERICAN
REVOLUTION
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
THE
MILITIAS
WON
BY
SEPERATING
THEMSELVES
FROM
AND
BECOMING
INDEPENDENT
OF
A
REPRESSIVE
GOVERNMENT
THEY
DIDNT
OVERTHROW
IT
AND
THOSE
COMMUNITIES
CANADA
AND
ENGLAND
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
DIDNT
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
WERE
STILL
UNDER
THAT
SAME
OLD
REGIME
IF
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
MILITIA
WERE
OFFENSIVE
TO
GO
OUT
AND
DESTROY
REPRESSIVE
GOVERNMENTS
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
MIGHT
BE
APPROPRIATE
BUT
THEIR
JOBS
IS
DEFENSIVE
AND
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
ARENT
SUITED
FOR
THAT
THERE
IS
ALSO
THE
QUESTION
OF
PERSONAL
AND
COLLECTIVE
ARMS
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
DEFINATELY
PROTECTS
OWNERSHIP
OF
PERSONAL
WEAPONS
SINCE
THE
VERY
NATURE
OF
THE
MILITIA
REQUIRES
MEMBERS
TO
PROVIDE
THEIR
OWN
ARMS
BUT
IT
ISNT
CLEAR
IF
IT
COVERS
OTHER
ARMS
CERTAINLY
NOT
ALL
MEMBERS
WOULD
SUPPLY
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
TANK
ONLY
A
FEW
COULD
OR
IF
THEY
WERE
TO
BE
USED
EFFECTIVELY
SHOULD
HOWEVER
THOSE
PROVIDING
THE
HEAVY
WEAPONS
HAVE
A
DISPROPORTIONATE
CONTROL
OVER
THE
MILITIA
AND
ITS
FIERPOWER
THE
MILITIAS
AS
THE
FRAMERS
ENVISIONED
THEM
WERE
EXTREMELY
DEMOCRATIC
IF
ONLY
OF
THE
MEMBERS
SUPPORTED
THE
CAUSE
ONLY
WOULD
RESPOND
TO
A
MUSTER
AND
THE
MILITIAS
FIREPOWER
WOULD
BE
PROPORTIONATELY
REDUCED
MILITIA
FIREPOWER
AND
THE
POPULAR
WILL
WERE
THEREFORE
LINKED
BUT
IF
A
SMALL
MINORITY
OF
THE
MEMBERS
SUPPLIED
A
LARGE
FRACTION
OF
THE
FIREPOWER
IN
THE
FORM
OF
HEAVY
WEAPONS
THIS
WOULD
ALL
CHANGE
THE
MILITIAS
FIREPOWER
WOULD
DEPEND
ON
THE
WILL
OF
A
SMALL
MINORITY
NOT
OF
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
WORSE
THAT
MINORITY
WOULD
BE
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
THEY
WOULD
BE
MUCH
RICHER
AS
A
RESULT
I
THINK
THE
NATURE
AND
CHARACTER
OF
THE
MILITIA
REQUIRES
THAT
EACH
MEMBER
PROVIDE
A
ROUGHLY
EQUAL
SHARE
OF
THE
MILITIAS
FIREPOWER
HIS
PERSONAL
WEAPONS
AND
SOME
EQUITABLE
FRACTION
OF
A
SQUADS
HEAVIER
FIREPOWER
