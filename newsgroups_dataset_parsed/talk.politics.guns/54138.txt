WRITES
WHAT
ABOUT
GUNS
WITH
NONLETHAL
BULLETS
LIKE
RUBBER
OR
PLASTIC
BULLETS
WOULD
THOSE
WORK
VERY
WELL
IN
STOPPING
AN
ATTACK
DOUG
HOLLAND
ANY
PROJECTILE
TRAVELING
AT
OR
NEAR
TYPICAL
BULLET
SPEEDS
IS
POTENTIALLY
LETHAL
EVEN
BLANKS
WHICH
HAVE
NO
PROJECTILE
CAN
CAUSE
DEATH
IF
THE
MUZZLE
IS
IN
CLOSE
PROXIMITY
TO
THE
VICTIM
I
HAVE
HEARD
OF
RUBBER
OR
PLASTIC
BULLETS
BEING
USED
EFFECTIVELY
DURING
RIOT
SITUATIONS
WHERE
THE
INTENT
IS
CROWD
CONTROL
RATHER
THAN
CLOSE
RANGE
SELF
DEFENSE
IVE
ALSO
SEEN
REPORTS
OF
DEATHS
CAUSED
BY
THEM
THE
BRITISH
IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
USE
OF
A
FIREARM
FOR
SELF
DEFENSE
IS
APPROPRIATE
AND
LAWFUL
ONLY
IN
THE
GRAVEST
OF
SITUATIONS
AT
THAT
POINT
I
CONSIDER
DEADLY
LETHAL
FORCE
TO
BE
A
PROPER
REACTION
AND
SO
DOES
THE
LAW
FURTHERMORE
USE
OF
LESS
EFFECTIVE
BUT
STILL
POTENTIALLY
LETHAL
FORCE
HAS
ITS
OWN
SET
OF
PROBLEMS
IT
MAY
WELL
TAKE
MORE
APPLICATIONS
OF
THE
LESS
EFFECTIVE
FORCE
TO
STOP
THE
INCIDENT
THIS
PLACES
ALL
PARTIES
AT
SOME
RISK
THE
VICTIM
BECAUSE
THE
ATTACK
HAS
NOT
STOPPED
AND
THE
ASSAILENT
SINCE
THE
AGGREGATE
DAMAGE
DONE
BY
THE
MULTIPLE
APPLICATIONS
MAY
WELL
BE
MORE
DEADLY
