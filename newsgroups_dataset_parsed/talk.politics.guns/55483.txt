re
why
are
we
being
censored
in
a
free
america
this
node
specificaly
in
article
you
write
which
article
of
the
constitution
gives
me
the
right
of
revolution
if
things
seem

dunno
if
youll
find
it
in
the
constitution
but
that
other
document
of
american
liberty
that
kids
are
taught
to
hallow
in
school
is
the
declaration
of
independence
that
document
is
in
fact
a
justification
not
just
for
the
right
if
revolution
but
of
the
duty
of
revolution
by
the
people
once
the
government
gets
too
oppressive
it
is
a
very
radical
document
and
i
recommend
all
americans
especially
those
in
office
read
it
once
a
year
