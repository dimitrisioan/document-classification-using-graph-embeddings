steve

got
a
citation
for
this
colin
greenwood
from
scotland
yard
did
a
study
that
showed
that
gun
control
has
had
no
effect
on
crime
or
murder
rates
in
the
uk
his
book
firearmscontrols
has
been
published

others
dispute
that
like
richard

america
as
a

and
newton

firearms
and

but
again
statistics
between

are

i
dont
know
how
anyone
can
state
that
gun
control
could
have
no
effect
on
homicide
rates
there
were
over
accidental
handgun
homicides
in
america
in
most
with

more
american
children
accidentally
shot
other
children
last
year
than
all

please
no
dictionary
arguments
about
rates
vs
total
numbers
okay
theyre
offered
for
emphasis
not
comparison
if
mr
greenwood
believes
that
brits
are
much
too
sober
and
coordinated
to
make
such
mistakes
id
like
to
introduce
him
to
my

amanda
from
brighton
i
used
to
have
some
pretty
nice
crystal
