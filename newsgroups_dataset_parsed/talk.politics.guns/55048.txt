TO
ASK
YOU

A
FEW
QUESTIONS
THAT
ARE
RELATED
TO
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
AND
TO
A
GREATER
DEGREE
THE
MANY
OTHER
RIGHTS
THAT
WE
TAKE
FOR
GRANTED
ON
A
DAILY
BASIS
YOURE
SLEEPING
AT
NIGHT
WHEN
YOU
HEAR
SOMEONE
IN
YOUR
HOUSE

THE
POLICE
HOW
WILL
YOU
DEFEND
YOURSELF
SHOULD
THE
NEED
ARISE
WHILE
YOU
ARE
WAITING
FOR
THE
POLICE
TO
ARIVE
YOU
ARE
DRIVING
YOUR
FAMILY
HOME
WHEN
YOUR
CAR
BREAKS
DOWN
A
GOOD
SAMARITAN
STOPS
TO
HELP
WHEN
YOU
FIND
YOU
AND
YOUR
FAMILY
AT
GUNPOINT
OR
KNIFEPOINT
HOW
WILL
YOU
DEFEND
YOURSELF
AND
YOUR
FAMILY
YOU
ARE
A

A

SITUATION
BUT
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
LET
THE
POLITICIANS
DECIDE
WHAT
SORT
OF
FORCE
OR
WEAPON
YOU
MAY
USE
TO
DEFEND
YOURSELF
AND
YOUR
FAMILY
MANY
TIMES
A

DAY
WAITING
PERIOD
IN
CALIFORNIA
DO
YOU

FEEL
THAT
ANY
LAW
ABIDING
CITIZEN
SHOULD
BE
REQUIRED
TO
WAIT
THIS
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
FOR
THE
PURCHASE
OF
A
HANDGUN
WHEN
HIS
LIFE
OR
FAMILY
MEMBERS
HAVE
BEEN
THREATENED
OUR
LOCAL

DO
AN

JOB
BUT
THEY
