is

lawful

i
have
been
convinced
of
the
right
of
americans
to
an
effective
selfdefense
but
something
strikes
me
as
odd
among
the
prorkba
arguments
presented
here
the
numbers
comparing
hundreds
of
thousands
indeed
even
a
million
of
instances
of
law
abiding
citizens
deterring
criminal
activity
seem
valid
to
me
likewise
the
number
of
guncaused
homicides
each
year
about
however
it
is
surprising
that
the
evil
antigun
empire
darth
vader
breathing
sound
effect
here
never
tries
to
compare
all
legitimate
gun
defenses
vs
all
gun
crimes
instead
its
always
all
legitimate
gun
defenses
which
includes
cases
in
which
the
criminals
are
shot
but
not
killed
and
cases
in
which
the
criminal
is
not
here
vs
just
criminal
gun
homicides
which
only
includes
case
sin
which
the
victim
died
why
is
this
of
course
it
wouldnt
be
unreasonable
to
say
that
in
each
crime
already
measured
involving
guns
the
consequnces
are
already
known
and
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
a
gunbased
bank
robbery
last
week
will
not
suddenly
turn
into
a
gunbasd
robberyhomicide
whereas
in
the
legitimate
gun
defenses
one
may
assume
that
all
those
criminals
who
were
deterred
would
have
committed
more
crime
or
more
serious
crimes
had
they
not
been
deterred
i
think
its
an
attempt
to
show
livessaved
v
liveslost
all
other
gun
related
crimes
dont
result
in
liveslost
on
the
other
hand
its
impossible
to
know
how
many
of
the
successful
self
defenses
prevented
lives
from
being
lost
in
other
words
the
liveslost
is
pretty
clear
its
the
homicide
and
non
negligent
manslaughter
number
while
the
lives
saved
is
some
percentage
of
the
successful
self
defenses
clearly
that
percentage
doesnt
have
to
be
real
high
to
show
that
livessaved
liveslost
as
a
semirelated
point
check
out
klecks
point
blank
i
believe
it
goes
into
some
related
areas
it
also
is
well
written
and
informative
