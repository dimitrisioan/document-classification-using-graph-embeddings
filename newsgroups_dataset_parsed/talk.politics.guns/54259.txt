dillon
pyron
says
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
ahem
hrumph
you
have
encurred
the
wrath
of
glock
owners
we
will
beat
you
with
our
hammers
oooops
dont
have
any
seriously
there
is
no
difference
in
the
safeties
betweena
glock
and
any
da
revolver
intellectually
think
of
the
glock
as
a
very
high
cap
revolver
ignoring
stove
pipes
misfeeds
and
all
the
other
bonus
exercises
that
autoloaders
give
you
that
is
every
gun
has
its
safe
moment
and
its
dangerous
moment
if
you
just
learn
how
to
handle
it
it
becomes
a
lot
less
dangerous
to
you

padi
all
very
true
im
going
on
what
i
have
read
and
heard
from
friends
basically
the
glock
is
great
but
i
have
heardread
that
it
is
a
lot
harder
to
learn
proper
handling
because
of
the
type
of
safety
that
it
has
i
was
looking
at
a
glock
and
the
sw
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
the
safties
on
the
guns
were
very
different
the
saftey
on
the
seemed
a
lot
more
safe
for
lack
of
a
better
word
than
the
one
on
the
glock
of
course
this
could
also
be
a
bad
thing
if
you
were
to
pull
the
gun
on
somebody
you
would
spend
more
time
fiddling
around
turning
the
safety
off
personally
i
like
the
glocks
because
they
are
very
light
and
i
think
they
look
really
cool
guess
thats
why
they
use
them
in
so
many
movies
but
i
wouldnt
get
one
as
my
first
semiauto
because
of
the
safety
i
would
prefer
more
training
with
a
traditional
semiauto
ala
colt
but
of
course
thats
just
my
opinion
