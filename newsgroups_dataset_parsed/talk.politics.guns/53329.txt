i
suppose
thats
true
if
you
maintain
that
and
are
hunting
weapons
i
think
they
are
fun
to
plink
canstargetsrandom
vc
with
but
not
suitable
for
real
hunting
wrong
both
are
legal
to
hunt
with
here
in
kentucky
i
have
a
picture
of
a
friend
with
a
nice
buck
which
he
shot
with
his
rifle
i
dont
think
many
deer
hunters
would
condone
your
friends
choice
of
rifle
i
must
agree
with
nathan
as
a
deer
hunter
i
find
it
inhumane
to
use
underpowered
weapons
for
deer
hunting
to
kill
cleanly
with
the
little
requires
extremely
good
marksmanship
most
hunting
situations
dont
allow
for
perfect
shots
hunters
should
use
sufficiently
powerful
weapons
to
drop
the
deer
with
a
single
hit
to
the
chest
the
from
the
or
sks
is
adequate
to
this
task
having
similar
ballistics
to
the
familiar
but
the
little
is
very
marginal
in
the
hands
of
the
expert
or
the
lucky
it
will
do
but
hunters
really
should
have
more
respect
for
their
quarry
gary
ill
agree
that
the
popular
gr
loading
for
rem
is
too
small
for
deersized
game
however
if
you
use
a
gr
semispritzer
or
the
sierra
gr
semipointed
bullet
this
would
be
suitable
like
any
round
you
keep
your
shots
within
a
reasonable
range
it
would
still
be
on
the
lower
end
of
what
id
consider
acceptable
performance
especially
those
long
distance
shots
out
west
hunting
monster
mule
deer
the
rem
has
been
declared
legal
for
deer
hunting
in
oklahoma
the
is
excellent
for
varmit
hunting
and
pest
control
the
in
particular
is
well
suited
given
its
heavy
barrel
and
heat
shielded
foregrip
add
a
highpower
scope
and
youre
in
dog
heaven
however
i
dont
think
nathan
janette
was
refering
to
the
specific
chambering
of
the
rifle
in
question
maybe
he
thinks
self
loading
rifles
have
no
place
in
deer
hunting
that
may
or
may
not
be
his
opinion
but
many
sportsmen
do
use
self
loading
rifles
and
shotguns
wrongo
nra
man
i
was
definitely
referring
to
the
round
not
the
autoloading
aspect
of
the
rifle
i
have
no
problem
with
responsible
hunting
that
doesnt
include
machine
guns
from
choppers
but
a
semi
is
fine
my
uncle
has
bagged
several
deer
with
gauge
slugs
i
would
prefer
that
a
hunter
use
as
much
of
the
catch
as
possible
and
i
dont
condone
hunting
for
sport
only
imho
of
course
two
questions
you
asserted
that
both
the
and
are
not
suitable
for
real
hunting
if
you
have
no
problem
with
hunting
or
using
self
loading
rifles
for
hunting
why
did
you
say
this
if
not
for
deer
then
what
about
other
smaller
game
when
did
i
get
the
nickname
nra
man
notice
i
have
never
referred
to
you
as
janette
which
you
dont
seem
to
like
do
i
get
any
superpowers
like
spider
man
or
powdered
toast
man

kennedy

and
now
