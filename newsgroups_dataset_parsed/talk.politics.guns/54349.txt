DANIEL

WRITES
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WACO
IS
NOT
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
BATF
IF
THEY
WOULD
OF
HAD
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PERSONAL
THEN
THEY
COULD
OF
CAPTURED
THE
COMPOUND
ON
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
AND
NONE
OF
THIS
WOULD
OF
HAPPENED
THE
BATF
NEEDS
MORE
PEOPLE
BETTER
WEAPONS
AND
MORE
ARMORED
TRANSPORTS
WHEN
THEY
MEET
HOSTILE
FIRE
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
MORE
FORCE
INSTEAD
OF
RETREATING
TO
A
STAND
OFF
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
A
JOB
THEN
DO
IT
RIGHT
THE
BATF
IS
THERE
TO
PROTECT
US
AND
THEY
MUST
HAVE
THE
PROPER
EQUIPMENT
AND
PEOPLE
TO
DO
THE
JOB
WITH
THE
WOD
AND
THE
INCREASED
CRIME
IN
THE
STREETS
THE
BATF
IS
NEEDED
MORE
NOW
THEN
EVER
IF
THEY
BLAST
AWAY
A
FEW
GOOD
FOKES
THEN
THAT
IS
THE
PRICE
WE
ALL
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
LAW
AND
ORDER
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
LOOK
AT
ALL
THE
GOOD
PEOPLE
THAT
DIED
IN
WARS
TO
PROTECT
THIS
GREAT
COUNTRY
OF
OURS
WITH
THE
ARMS
BUILD
UP
IN
WACO
THEY
NEEDED
TO
HIT
THAT
COMPOUND
WITH
MEGA
FIRE
POWER
THEY
COULD
OF
GONE
IN
THERE
BLASTING
AND
KILLED
A
FEW
WOMEN
AND
KIDS
BUT
IT
WOULD
OF
BEEN
BETTER
THEN
LETTING
THEM
ALL
BURN
TO
DEATH
DAYS
LATER
DID
YOU
FORGET
TO
PUT
IN
A
SARCASM
