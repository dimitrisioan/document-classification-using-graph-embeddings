I
BALANCE
MY
GUT
REACTION
TO
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
INDEPENDENT
FACTS
AS
I
SEE
THEM
ON
VIDEO
I
USUALLY
ADOPT
THE
SCENARIO
THAT
IS
SIMPLEST
AND
MOST
PLAUSIBLE
I
DO
NOT
GENERALLY
BELIEVE
IN
CONSPIRACY
THEORIES
THAT
INVOLVE
COMPLICATED
AND
UNLIKELY
SCENARIOS
THEN
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
WHY
WAS
NO
ONE
ELSE
PERMITTED
TO
TALK
TO
KORESH
KORESH
HAD
A
LAWYER
DEGUIN
WHO
HE
SPOKE
TO
IN
PERSON
SEVERAL
TIMES
DURING
THE
LAST
FEW
WEEKS
IT
CANNOT
BE
DENIED
THAT
IF
THEY
HAD
LEFT
THEM
ALONE
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NO
FIRE

THIS
STRIKES
ME
AS
A
TAD
INGENOUS
IF
X
HAD
DONENOTE
DONE
Y
THEN
Z
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
HAPPENED
I
TEND
TO
PLACE
THA
RESPONSIBILITY
ON
THE
GROUPPERSON
ACTUALLY
COMMITTING
THE
ACT
NOT
ON
THOSE
WHON
FORCED
THEM
TO
DO
IT
AFTER
ALL
TO
TAKE
AN
EXTREME
EXAMPLE
IF
THE
BRITISH
WERE
NOT
IN
NORTHERN
IRELAND
THE
IRA
WOULD
NOT
BE
FORCED
TO
PLACE
BOMBS
IN
SHOPPING
CENTERS
THAT
SAID
THIS
WHOLE
SORRY
STORY
WAS
A
TOTALLY
UNECESSARY
UTTERLY
FUCKED
UP
MESS
FROM
THE

AND
I
DONT
SPEAK
FOR

WHICH
IS
TOO
BAD
BECAUSE
THEY
COULD
USE
