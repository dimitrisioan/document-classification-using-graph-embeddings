WRITES
RECENTLY
WHILE
LOOKING
AROUND
IN
TRADERS
SPORTING
GOODS
STORE
A
VERY
WELL
STOCKED
FIREARMS
STORE
I
DISCOVERED
A
PRINTED
DOCUMENT
THAT
WAS
BEING
DISTRIBUTED
BY
THE
GOOD
FOLKS
WHO
WORK
THERE
TRADERS
BTW
IS
LOCATED
IN
SAN
LEANDRO
CA
THE
NEWSPAPERS
HAVE
NOW
DECIDED
TO
CENSOR
GUN
ADS
WHICH
IS
WHY
YOU
NO
LONGER
SEE
THE
ADS
THAT
TRADERS
SAN
LEANDRO
HAS
RUN
FOR
MANY
YEARS
THESE
ADS
WERE
RUN
FOR
THE
LAWABIDING
HONEST
CITIZENS
WHO
OWN
FIREARMS
FOR
SPORTING
USE
OR
SELFPROTECTION
THEY
CERTAINLY
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
DO
SO
UNDER
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
RIGHT
TO
BEAR
ARMS
ARE
YOU
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
IM
CURRENTLY
LOOKING
AT
A
COPY
OF
LAST
THURSDAYS
SF
CHRONICLE
AND
THERE
IS
THE
TYPICAL
ONE
COLUMN
TRADERS
AD
ON
PAGE
IN
THE
SPORTS
SECTION
NOT
ONLY
THAT
BUT
THERE
IS
A
PART
IN
THE
MIDDLE
WHICH
RATHER
PROMINENTLY
SAYS
WANTED
WE
PAY
CASH
FOR
ASSAULT
RIFLES
AND
PISTOLS
GRANTED
I
HAVENT
SEEN
TODAYS
PAPER
YET
BUT
ID
BE
SURPRISED
IF
THERE
WASNT
A
TRADERS
AD
IN
IT
ITS
PROBABLY
WORTH
IT
TO
WRITE
TO
THE
CHRONICLE
AND
OTHER
PAPERS
ANYWAY
BECAUSE
ALL
THEIR
ANTIGUN
EDITORIALS
ARE
DISGUSTING
BY
THE
WAY
LET
ME
PUT
IN
A
PLUG
FOR
TRADERS
I
HAVE
SHOPPED
ALL
OVER
THE
SF
BAY
AREA
AND
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANOTHER
STORE
WITH
LOWER
PRICES
AND
THEIR
SELECTION
IS
AMAZING
