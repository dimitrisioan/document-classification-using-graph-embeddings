NICE
SUMMARY
KEITH
THANKS
I
TALKED
TO
THE
FEDERAL
DEPT
OF
JUSTICE
DOJ
OTTAWA
TO
TRY
AND
CLARIFY
A
BUNCH
OF
THINGS
REGARDING
CHANGES
TO
CANADIAN
GUN
LAWS
I
AM
POSTING
HERE
FOR
INFORMATIONAL
PURPOSES
QUESTIONS
TO
EMAIL
FOLLOWUP
TO
TPG
IT
IS
STILL
TECHNICALLY
FEASIBLE
BUT
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
GET
A
CONCEALED
CARRY
PERMIT
IN
CANADA
THIS
IS
CONTRARY
TO
WHAT
I
WAS
TOLD
BY
A
POLICE
OFFICER
IT
IS
STILL
LEGAL
TO
USE
LETHAL
FORCE
SUCH
AS
A
FIREARM
TO
PROTECT
LIFE
ALSO
CONTRARY
TO
WHAT
THE
OFFICER
TOLD
ME
GUNS
MUST
BE
STORED
LOCKED
UP
AND
UNLOADED
HOWEVER
REGARDING
HICAPACITY
MAGAZINES
IT
IS
STILL
NOT
CLEAR
WHO
WILL
BE
EXEMPT
OR
HOW
THIS
WILL
BE
MANAGED
THIS
IS
UP
TO
EACH
PROVINCE
THE
GENERAL
IDEA
IS
THAT
EXEMPT
PERSONS
WILL
RECEIVE
A
LETTERFORM
AUTHORIZING
THEM
TO
POSSESS
THE
HIGH
CAPACITY
MAGAZINES
APPARENTLY
THE
AUTHORIZATION
IS
TO
SPECIFY
HOW
MANY
OF
THESE
PROHIBITED
WEAPONS
YOU
WILL
BE
ALLOWED
TO
POSSESS
DEALERS
WILL
BE
ALLOWED
TO
ORDER
HIGH
CAPACITY
MAGS
FOR
THOSE
ALLOWED
TO
POSSESS
THEM
BUT
WILL
NOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
STOCK
THEM
HIGH
CAPACITY
MAGAZINES
CONVERTED
TO
COMPLY
WITH
THE
NEW
LIMITS
WILL
NOT
BE
CONSIDERED
PROHIBITED
WEAPONS
AMENDMENTS
TO
THE
REGULATIONS
SPECIFY
SOME
POSSIBLE
METHODS
TO
ALTER
THE
MAGAZINES
SOME
MANUFACTURERS
BERETTA
WILL
BE
MARKETING
REDUCED
CAPACITY
MAGAZINES
GOD
KNOWS
HOW
MUCH
THEYLL
CHARGE
FOR
THESE
THIS
COVERS
MOST
OF
WHAT
WE
DISCUSSED
I
HAVE
TYPED
THIS
FROM
MEMORY
DO
NOT
TAKE
IT
AS
GOSPEL
I
AM
NOT
A
LAWYER
AND
I
REFUSE
