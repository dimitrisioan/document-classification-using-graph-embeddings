RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE
FIGURES
EXACTLY
BUT
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
DEATHS
IN
TEXAS
IN
THAT
WAS
CAUSED
BY
GUNS
THIS
IS
MORE
THAN
THOSE
BEEING
KILLED
IN
CARACCIDENTS
YES
THERE
COULD
BE
THAT
LOW
SENTENCES
OR
HIGH
POVERTY
COULD
INFLUENCE
THE
FIGURES
BUT
THEYRE
STILL
PRETTY
HIGH
RIGHT
I
ALSO
BELIEVE
TEXAS
HAS
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
LIBERAL
GUNLAWS
IN
USA
I
SHOULD
NOT
SUFFER
BECAUSE
OF
OTHERS
WE
ALL
AGREE
ON
THIS
ONE
BUT
WE
ALSO
LIVE
IN
A
SOCIATY
AND
THEREFOR
WELL
HAVE
TO
GIVE
UP
SOME
OF
OUR
FREEDOM
NOTE
THE
DO
YOU
HAVE
AN
INSURANCE
THEN
YOULL
HAVE
TO
PAY
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
OTHERS
DO
DO
YOU
BUY
ANYTHING
YOU
ARE
PAYING
FOR
THOSE
WHO
RETURN
GOODS
STEAL
OR
EVEN
THOSE
WHO
GETS
A
BONUS
DO
YOU
LIVE
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLE
THEN
YOU
CANT
DO
ERERYTHING
YOUD
WANT
BURPINGFARTING
PLAYING
MUSIC
LOUD
WHAT
THE
HELL
IS
HE
TRYING
TO
SAY
WHEN
YOU
LIVE
IN
A
SOCIETY
USA
ARE
STILLL
COUNTED
AS
ONE
YOU
HAVE
TO
SACCRIFICE
THE
QUESTION
IS
HOW
MUCH
ONE
STATE
DONT
REMEMBER
WHICH
TEXAS
TRIED
TO
IMPOSE
A
RULE
THAT
YOU
COULD
ONLY
BUY
ONE
GUN
EACH
MONTH
THINK
YOU
ALL
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
I
RESPECT
THE
RIGHT
TO
DEFEND
YOURSELF
BUT
THAT
RIGHT
SHOULD
NOT
INFLICT
ON
OTHER
PEOPLE
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
YOU
ALL
REALIZE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
IN
AMERICA
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
YOU
WONT
TAKE
THE
CAR
AWAY
FROM
THE
DRUNK
DRIVER
YOU
HOPE
TO
CURE
HIM
FIRST
HOPE
LIFE
