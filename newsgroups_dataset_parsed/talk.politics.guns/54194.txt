JOHN

WRITES
PICKING
NITS
OVER
TANKS
FIRING
THE
MAIN
GUN
OR
NOT
DELETED
I
THINK
THE
POINT
IS
BEING
MISSED
THAT
IT
IS
APPARANTLY
ACCEPTABLE
FOR
BIG
GOVERNMENT
BIG
BROTHER
TO
USE
TANKS
TO
CONTROL
THE
PEOPLE
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
DONT
USE
THE
BIG
GUN
BUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IS
ALLRIGHT
TANKS
DEPLOYED
AGAINST
CIVILIANS
LET
ALONE
FIRING
ON
THEM
WITH
CREW
SERVED
WEAPONRY
A
HEAVY
MACHINE
GUN
IS
CREWSERVED
IS
SOMETHING
BOTH
OUR
PRESS
AND
GOVERNMENT
HOWL
ABOUT
INSTANTLY
WHEN
DONE
IN
SOME
OTHER
COUNTRY
AGAINST
CIVILIANS
THAT
HAVE
AT
MOST
ONESHOTATATIME
LIGHT
SMALL
ARMS
CERTAINLY
NOTHING
THAT
PLACES
THE
PEOPLE
IN
OR
BEHIND
THE
TANK
IN
ANY
REAL
DANGER
MOLOTOV
COCTAILS
A
ROUND
FROM
A
RIFLE
OR
PISTOL
DEALS
WITH
ANYBODY
APPROACHING
WITH
ONE
OF
THOSE
AND
SNIPERS
TOO
OFTEN
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
STRAYS
FROM
OTHER
COPSGUARDARMY
GUNFIRE
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
GROUP
OR
ON
THE
NET
BUT
THE
IDEA
OF
TANKS
BEING
USED
TO
CONTROL
CIVILIANS
IN
ANYTHING
THAT
PRETENDS
TO
BE
A
FREE
SOCIETY
IS
OUTRAGEOUS
WHEN
BIG
GOVERNMENT
FEELS
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
USE
THAT
KIND
OF
FORCE
TO
STOMP
OUT
PROTESTS
EVEN
VIOLENT
OF
THE
CITIZENS
THAT
SUGGESTS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
TOTALLY
OUT
OF
CONTROL
SINCE
THAT
IS
EFFECTIVELY
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECLARING
WAR
ON
ITS
OWN
PEOPLE
IF
THE
GOVERNMENT
WAS
LIVING
UP
TO
ITS
RESPONSIBILITY
GOVERNMENT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
BY
THE
PEOPLE
NOT
THE
LORDS
AND
OTHER
ELITES
WHO
WANT
TO
KEEP
THEIR
GOOD
THING
GOING
THE
CITIZENS
WOULDNT
FEEL
THE
NEED
TO
BE
RESORTING
TO
ACTS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
SQUASHED
WITH
A
MILITARY
BOOT
PEOPLE
DO
THINGS
LIKE
THAT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
BECOME
CONVINCED
THAT
IT
IS
THE
ONLY
OPTION
THAT
REMAINS
OTHER
ATTEMPTS
TO
HAVE
GRIEVANCES
REDRESSED
HAVE
BEEN
IGNORED
AND
YES
THERE
IS
A
CRIMINAL
ELEMENT
THAT
WILL
EXPLOIT
THIS
BUT
THE
FACT
REMAINS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
BEEN
UNRESPONSIVE
OR
SUCH
ACTS
WOULDNT
BE
APT
TO
HAPPEN
STILL
NOT
AN
EXCUSE
TO
OPEN
UP
ON
CIVILIANS
WITH
TANKS
HEAVY
MACHINE
GUNS
OR
WHATEVER
ITS
THE
OLD
MIGHT
MAKES
RIGHT
PHILOSOPHY
THAT
IS
THE
HALLMARK
OF
A
GOVERNMENT
GOING
ROGUE
THEY
DONT
LIKE
IT
TOUGH
WE
WILL
SIMPLY
SQUASH
THEM
UNDER
AN
IRON
BOOT
ACTUALLY
ADDRESSING
THEIR
GRIEVANCES
IN
OTHER
THAN
TOKEN
FASHION
WITH
HUGE
VOLUMES
OF
HOT
AIR
IS
JUST
TOO
INCONVENIENT
SORT
OF
A
VARIATION
ON
MUSHROOM
MANAGEMENT
KEEP
THEM
IN
THE
DARK
SMOTHER
THEM
WITH
SHIT
AND
CRUSH
THEM
WHEN
READY
AND
THESE
ARE
THE
FOLKS
THAT
MANY
LIBERALS
ARE
TRYING
TO
ARRANGE
THINGS
SO
THAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
MONOPOLY
ON
COERCIVE
FORCE
FIREARMS
THAT
ARE
THAN
EXPENSIVE
TOYS
BY
GUTTING
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
CUZ
IT
JUST
ISNT
PROGRESSIVE
OR
DOESNT
FIT
IN
WITH
MODERN
THINKING
ANYMORE
UNBELIEVABLE
AND
I
DO
BELIEVE
AMID
THE
SMOKE
CONFUSION
ETC
OF
A
REAL
RIOT
SITUATION
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
TANK
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
FIRING
THE
MAIN
GUN
INTO
A
BUILDING
AT
CLOSE
RANGE
ONE
WOULD
HEAR
AN
EXPLOSION
AMONG
MANY
EXPLOSIONS
IT
IS
LOUD
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
STAND
OUT
LIKE
A
POUND
BOMB
OR
A
TACTICAL
NUKE
THERE
WOULD
BE
A
HOLE
BLOWN
IN
THE
WALL
AND
SOME
RUBBLE
BUT
WITH
TANKS
KNOCKING
OVER
WALLS
AND
OTHER
SOURCES
OF
BUILDINGS
TURNING
INTO
RUBBLE
AND
OTHER
COVERING
RACKET
SUCH
AS
GUNFIRE
INCLUDING
TACKING
AWAY
IT
WOULD
NOT
STAND
OUT
THAT
MUCH
AND
COULD
BE
EXPLAINED
BY
MUSTA
BEEN
A
GAS
LEAK
I
THINK
IT
COULD
BE
DONE
AND
NOT
BE
REPORTED
UNDER
SUCH
CONDITIONS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
IT
IS
NOT
LIKE
A
TANK
DRIVING
DOWN
A
QUIET
STREET
ON
A
SUNDAY
AFTERNOON
TURNING
AND
FIRING
YOU
KNOW
THAT
WOULD
STAND
OUT
AND
BE
PRETTY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
COVER
