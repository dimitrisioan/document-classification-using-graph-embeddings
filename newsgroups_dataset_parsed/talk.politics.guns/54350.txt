AHEM
SEE
THE
WAR
ON
DRUGS
AS
SPONSORED
BY
THE
BUSH
AND
REAGAN
ADMINISTRATIONS
THE
PRECEDENT
HAD
WELL
BEEN
SET
FOR
FEDERAL
AGENCIES
TO
STEP
ON
MORE
THAN
A
FEW
OF
WHAT
PEOPLE
CONSIDER
RIGHTS
I
WONT
MAKE
EXCUSES
FOR
ANYONE
BUT
MOST
OF
THE
DAMAGE
HAD
BEEN
DONE
BEFORE
CLINTON
EVEN
ENTERED
THE
RACE
IN
NOT
TO
MENTION
LAST
YEARS
WEAVER
AFFAIR
ANYWAY
HERES
HOW
I
SEE
THE
WACO
AFFAIR
ID
BE
INTERESTED
IN
OTHER
PEOPLES
INTERPRETATIONS
KORESH
AND
HIS
PEOPLE
WERE
BASICALLY
MINDING
THEIR
OWN
BUSINESS
SOME
WEAPONS
VIOLATIONS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
COMMITTED
AND
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
DISAPPROVED
OF
PROSECUTING
HIM
FOR
THOSE
VIOLATIONS
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THE
BATF
WAS
CRIMINAL
FOR
STARTING
NEGOTIATIONS
WITH
A
MILITARY
STYLE
ASSAULT
AND
FOR
FIRING
INTO
A
HOUSE
WHERE
THERE
WERE
CHILDREN
AND
OTHER
NONCOMBATANTS
I
DONT
SEE
THEY
COULDNT
JUST
LEAVE
A
TOKEN
GUARD
ON
THE
PLACE
AND
WAIT
THE
BDS
OUT
I
DONT
APPROVE
OF
THE
TEAR
GAS
APPROACH
AND
IF
IT
CAUSED
THE
FIRE
TO
BE
STARTED
I
THINK
THE
FBI
AGENT
RESPONSIBLE
SHOULD
SPEND
YEARS
IN
JAIL
HOWEVER
IF
KORESHS
RESPONSE
TO
THE
TEAR
GAS
WAS
TO
KILL
EVERYONE
THERE
I
HOLD
HIM
LARGELY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
DEATHS
DON
