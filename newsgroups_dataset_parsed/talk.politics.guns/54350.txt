ahem
see
the
war
on
drugs
as
sponsored
by
the
bush
and
reagan
administrations
the
precedent
had
well
been
set
for
federal
agencies
to
step
on
more
than
a
few
of
what
people
consider
rights
i
wont
make
excuses
for
anyone
but
most
of
the
damage
had
been
done
before
clinton
even
entered
the
race
in
not
to
mention
last
years
weaver
affair
anyway
heres
how
i
see
the
waco
affair
id
be
interested
in
other
peoples
interpretations
koresh
and
his
people
were
basically
minding
their
own
business
some
weapons
violations
may
have
been
committed
and
i
wouldnt
have
disapproved
of
prosecuting
him
for
those
violations
however
i
think
the
batf
was
criminal
for
starting
negotiations
with
a
military
style
assault
and
for
firing
into
a
house
where
there
were
children
and
other
noncombatants
i
dont
see
they
couldnt
just
leave
a
token
guard
on
the
place
and
wait
the
bds
out
i
dont
approve
of
the
tear
gas
approach
and
if
it
caused
the
fire
to
be
started
i
think
the
fbi
agent
responsible
should
spend
years
in
jail
however
if
koreshs
response
to
the
tear
gas
was
to
kill
everyone
there
i
hold
him
largely
responsible
for
their
deaths
don
