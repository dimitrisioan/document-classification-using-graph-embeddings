MITCHELL

TODD
WRITES
IF
THERE
WAS
A
LARGE
PROPANE
TANK
AND
IT
WAS
BREACHED
DONT
YOU
THINK
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
AN
IDENTIFIABLE
EXPLOSION
FROM
WHAT
I
SAW
OF
THE
VIDEOTAPE
THERE
WAS
AN
EXPLOSION
WHICH
LOOKED
MORE
LIKE
ONE
DUE
TO
PROPANE
RATHER
THAN
OFFICIAL
VERSION
AMMUNITION
THE
ONLY
EVIDENCE
THAT
EXISTS
RIGHT
NOW
AT
LEAST
WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
IS
VARIOUS
CLAIMS
AND
COUNTER
CLAIMS
IM
WAITING
UNTIL
THE
HARD
EVIDENCE
IS
RELEASED
WHAT
ABOUT
YOU
IF
ONLY
WE
COULD
BE
CERTAIN
THAT
THE
HARD
EVIDENCE
WILL
BE
RELEASED
