examiner
reports
that
clinton
has
issued
instructions
to
federal
law
enforcement
that
they
may
not
kill
or
injure
anyone
to
resolve
the
waco
situation
so
theyve
built
a
fence
around
the
compound
and
are
now
seriously
considering
building
up
the
fence
to
prisoncamp
levels
pulling
out
most
of
the
manpower
and
waiting
however
many
months
it
takes
well
either
the
examiner
was
wrong
as
usual
or
clinton
lied
again
or
perhaps
david
koresh
didnt
listen
too
well
just
because
mistakes
were
made
does
not
mean
the
president
lied
