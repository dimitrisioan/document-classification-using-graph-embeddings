a
little
question
of
blame
was
re
atf
burns
dividian
ranch
no
survivors
in
article

the
lawnmowerman
writes
however
it
was
the
branch
davidian
people
in
there
that
insisted
on
staying
there
with
their
savior
yeah
right
budy
boy
because
he
had
brainwashed
them
into
believing
that
what
ever
he
says
is
the
truth
even
if
means
that
they
are
to
give
up
their
lives
for
his
cause
tolerent
arent
we
theirs
was
hardly
the
first
faithsectcult
to
espouse
this
type
of
belief
therefore
it
is
davids
fault
and
not
the
atfs
who
gave
them
to
days
to
get
out
this
was
days
to
many
for
me
and
for
many
of
the
rest
of
the
us
i
keep
hearing
this
and
while
ill
agree
that
he
should
have
come
out
legally
that
was
his
best
option
he
didnt
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
legal
provision
for
were
tired
of
this
shit
lets
just
kick
some
ass
so
i
have
a
question
for
you
here
goes
i
come
up
to
you
and
point
a
gun
at
you
saying
im
going
to
count
to
ten
if
you
arent
standing
on
your
head
by
then
ill
kill
you
you
believe
that
standing
on
your
head
is
the
road
to
damnation
so
you
dont
do
it
you
are
now
dead
is
it
my
fault
for
shooting
you
or
youre
fault
for
being
shot
koresh
wouldnt
stand
on
his
head
aaron
