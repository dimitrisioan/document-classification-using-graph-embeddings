NEEDS
MORE
PEOPLE
BETTER
WEAPONS
AND
MORE
ARMORED
TRANSPORTS
WITH
THE
ARMS
BUILD
UP
IN
WACO
THEY
NEEDED
TO
HIT
THAT
COMPOUND
WITH
MEGA
FIRE
POWER
THEY
COULD
OF
GONE
IN
THERE
BLASTING
AND
KILLED
A
FEW
WOMEN
AND
KIDS
BUT
IT
WOULD
OF
BEEN
BETTER

LETTING

IS
THIS
A
JOKE
THE
LEGAL
WAY
TO
SERVE
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
IS
TO
KNOCK
ON
THE
DOOR
TOSSING
IN
A
GRENADE
TO
SERVE
A
SEARCH

VIOLATES
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
AND
IS
HENCE
ILLEGAL
THE
BD
COMPLIED
WITH
LEGAL
SEARCH
WARRANTS
IN
THE
PAST
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THE
BATF
USED
AN
ILLEGAL
