do
you
know
how
many
deaths
each
year
are
caused
by
selfinflicted
gun
shot
wounds
by
people
wearing
thigh
holsters
there
are
roughly
fatal
firearmsrelated
accidents
each
year
the
large
majority
involve
rifles
and
shotgun
there
are
under
fatal
handgun
accidents
each
year
i
really
doubt
all
of
those
occur
while
the
pistol
is
holstered

the
number
of
selfinflicted
gunshot
wounds
by
people
wearing
thigh
holsters
is
probably
well
under
per
year
im
neither
a
doctor
nor
a
firearms
tech
expert
but
it
would
seem
that
given
the
way
a
holstered
gun
points
accidental
injuries
inflicted
that
way
would
be
among
the
least
lethal
