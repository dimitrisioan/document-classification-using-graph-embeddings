JASON
DURBIN
WRITES
IF
EVEN
HALF
THE
SPECULATIONS
OF
CONSPIRACY
MADE
ABOUT
THIS
ARE
TRUE
THEN
I
WOULD
EXPECT
THAT
YOU
PEOPLE
SHOULD
BE
CALLING
FOR
THE
ATF
FBI
TEXAS
RANGERS
CONGRESS
AND
ALL
BRANCHES
OF
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
TO
BE
IMMEDIATELY
AND
COMPLETEY
DISBANDED
NO
EXCEPTIONS
JEEZ
DO
YOU
PEOPLE
REALLY
BELEIVE
ALL
THIS
CRAP
DO
YOU
ALSO
BELEIVE
IN
THE
ZIONIST
OCCUPATION
GOVERNMENT
AND
THE
TOOTH
FAIRY
JASON
IVE
HEARD
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THIS
DISMISSED
AS
CONSPIRACY
NUTS
BUT
NOBODY
SEEMS
TO
BE
TALKING
ABOUT
A
CONSPIRACY
AT
LEAST
AT
THE
BEGINNING
THERE
WERE
A
LOT
OF
BAD
DECISIONS
THAT
WENT
INTO
THIS
TRAGEDY
AND
SOME
PEOPLE
MAY
NOW
BE
TAKING
SOME
SERIOUS
EVASIVE
ACTION
TO
AVOID
BEING
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
UNEXPECTED
RESULTS
OF
THOSE
BAD
DECISIONS
ACTUALLY
THE
ONLY
ONES
I
SEE
THAT
ARE
TIED
INTO
A
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
ARE
THE
ONES
RAVING
ABOUT
DERANGED
CULTISTS
WITH
STOCKPILES
OF
WEAPONS
AND
SUICIDE
PACTS
ADMITTEDLY
MISTAKES
WERE
MADE
BUT
WHY
ATTRIBUTE
THEM
TO
MALICE
RATHER
THAN
STUPIDITY
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
US
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
FOLLOWING
THIS
PRETTY
CLOSELY
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
AND
WE
WOUD
PROBABLY
AGREE
THAT
THIS
TRAGEDY
WAS
MORE
THE
RESULT
OF
STUPIDITY
THAN
MALICE
