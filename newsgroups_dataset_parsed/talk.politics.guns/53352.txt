YOURE
A
GREAT
DEBATER

PLEASE
DIRECT
MY
ATTENTION
TOWARDS
ANY
POSTING
OF
MINE
WHERE
I
CLAIMED
SUPERIOR
SOURCES

ITS
PROBABLY
BECAUSE

OTHERS
SEEM

IF

I
APOLOGIZE
YES

FAIL
TO
SEE
THE

TO
COMPARE
ABSOLUTE

BETWEEN
TWO

THAT
HAVE
MAJOR

WHINE
THAT
YOU
ARE
AFRAID

THEREFORE
ACCORDING

MADE

REMEMBER
ITS

AND
A
WHINEY
DEBATING
