national
crime
survey
well
i
dropped
by
the
library
yesterday
and
picked
up
back
copies
of
the
national
crime
survey
in
an
effort
to
examine
what
it
said
about
selfdefense
with
a
firearm
i
havent
ground
through
much
in
the
way
of
numbers
yet
but
a
couple
of
things
jumped
out
at
me
first
only
and
specify
the
type
of
weapon
used
in
self
defense
and
refer
only
to
weapon
the
second
is
that
while
assaults
rose
about
from
to
wgun
defenses
reported
fell
by
almost
unless
theres
an
explanation
for
this
im
tempted
to
mark
it
as
a
reporting
problem
and
as
such
going
ahead
with
any
examination
of
the
numbers
would
be
a
waste
of
time
anybody
have
an
idea
what
might
have
cause
a
real
difference
and
not
just
a
reporting
difference
the
survey
doesnt
appear
to
have
changed
significantly
