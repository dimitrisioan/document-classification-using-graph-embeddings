yeah
funny
how
you
didnt
wait
for
the
fbi
spokesdroid
latest
reversal
of
facts
before
proclaiming
the
bds
burned
themselves
to
death
if
you
wont
believe
anything
the
government
says
and
the
press
is
not
reliable
according
to
the
same
logic
then
what
do
you
base
your
statements
on
wild
speculation
laced
with
a
healthy
dose
of
paranoia
funny
brent
but
so
far
we
have
heard
two
versions
of
the
facts
what
the
government
says
this
includes
what
the
government
says
that
two
survivors
have
said
what
koreshs
lawyer
who
was
actually
inside
the
compound
says
including
what
he
says
that
most
of
the
survivors
have
said
strange
but
they
seem
to
disagree
in
most
important
particulars
if
anyone
has
actually
seen
news
reports
of
any
of
the
survivors
speaking
firsthand
feel
free
ot
pitch
in
i
may
have
missed
it
but
my
money
is
that
their
story
will
sound
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
case
and
not
at
all
like
