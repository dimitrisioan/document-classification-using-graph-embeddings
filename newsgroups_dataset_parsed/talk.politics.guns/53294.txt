no

dont
make
up
for
this
by
murdering
as
many
people
with

you
just
cant
compare
this
way
all
homicides
must
be
shown
per
capita
not
just
handguns
the
availability
of
them
in
the
usa
makes
them
the
preferred
murder
weapon

and
some

will

it
might
be
contended
that
if
gun
murderers
were
deprived
of
guns
that
they
would
find
a
way
to
kill
as
often
with
knives
if
this
were
so
knife
attacks
in
cities
where
guns
were
widely
used
in
homicide
would
be
expected
to
show
a
low
fatality
rate
and
knife
attacks
in
cities
where
guns
were
not
so
widely
used
like
vancouver
would
show
a
higher
fatality
rate
but
the
natl
commission
on
the
causes
and
prevention
of
violence
task
force
analyzed
the
data
and
found
this
not
to
be
the
case
it
appeared
to
them
that
as
the
number
of
knife
attacks
increased
in
relation
to
the
number
of
firearms
attacks
which
presumably
happened
where
guns
were
less
available
to
assailants
the
proportion
of
fatal
knife
attacks
did
not
increase
relative
to
the
proportion
of
gun
attacks
in
fact
the
reverse
was
true
what
was
found
was
that
most
homicides
did
not
show
a
determination
on
the
part
of
the
assailant
to
kill
fatalities
caused
by
knife
tended
to
show
a
singlemindedness
on
the
part
of
the
assailant
to
do
grave
physical
injury
multiple
stabs
wounds
wounds
concentrated
about
the
head
neck
and
chest
etc
most
gun
homicides
did
not
show
this
pattern
rather
more
fatal
attacks
were
committed
during
a
moment
of
rage
and
not
the
focused
intent
to
kill

victim

then
since
england

my

left
because
of
the
oppression
you
must
compare
england
before
strict

laws
to
england
after
strict
gun
laws
to
be
able
to
draw
any
meaning
at
all
england
has
essentially
legalized

so
there
are
no
drug
gangs
battling

turf
etc
there
if
you
drop
out
the

killings
here
the
usa
would
look
a
whole
lot
more
peaceful
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
which
make
a
difference
actually
im
not
fond
of
making
any
kind
of
social
parallels
between
europeans
and
americans
there
are
more
cultural
beahvioral
and
economic
differences
between
us
than
similarities
i
just
sort
of
found
myself
backed
into
that
corner
over
the
last
couple
of
weeks
i
dont
think
we
could
ever
attain
the
low
levels
of
european
violent
crime
here
in
the
us
whether
we
banned
guns
or
required
every
lawabiding
citizen
to
carry
a
loaded
uzi
on
the
other
hand
we
can
draw
lessons
from
neighbors
who
are
more
culturally
similar
namely
the
canadians
in
fact
an
exhaustive
sevenyear
study
has
already
been
done
of
the
respective
crime
rates
of
vancouver
british
columbia
and
seattle
washington
cities
with
roughly
the
same
population
urban
economy
geography
and
crime
but
with
decidedly
different
approaches
to
gun
control
in
seattle
handguns
may
be
purchased
legally
for
selfdefense
after
a
waiting
period
a
permit
can
be
obtained
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
the
recreational
use
of
handguns
is
minimally
restricted
in
vancouver
selfdefense
is
not
considered
a
valid
or
legal
reason
to
purchase
a
handgun
concealed
weapons
are
not
permitted
recreational
uses
of
handguns
target
shooting
collecting
are
regulated
by
the
province
purchase
of
a
handgun
requires
a
restrictedweapons
permit
a
permit
to
carry
may
be
obtained
in
order
to
transport
the
weapon
to
licensed
shooting
clubs
handguns
transported
by
vehicle
must
be
stored
in
the
trunk
in
a
locked
box
in
short
gun
control
but
not
unreasonably
so
both
cities
aggressively
enforce
their
gun
laws
convictions
for
gunrelated
offenses
carry
similar
penalties
the
researchers
studied
all
cases
of
robbery
assault
simple
and
aggravated
burglary
and
homicides
occurring
in
seattle
and
vancouver
from
to
in
defining
the
cases
they
used
the
same
standard
the
fbis
unified
crime
report
results
during
the
sevenyear
study
the
annual
rate
of
robbery
in
seattle
was
found
to
be
only
slightly
higher
than
that
in
vancouver
burglaries
occurred
at
nearly
identical
rates
assaults
were
recorded
in
seattle
versus
in
vancouver
the
risk
of
being
a
victim
of
a
simple
assault
in
seattle
was
found
to
be
only
slightly
higher
than
vancouver
and
the
risk
of
aggravated
assault
was
also
slightly
higher
however
when
aggravated
assaults
were
subdivided
by
weapon
and
the
mechanism
of
assault
a
clear
pattern
emerged
although
both
cities
reported
nearly
identical
rates
of
aggravated
assault
involving
knives
and
other
dangerous
weapons
firearms
were
far
more
likely
to
be
used
in
seattle
in
fact
times
as
often
over
the
sevenyear
study
homicides
occurred
in
seattle
per
vs
homicides
in
vancouver
per
after
adjustment
for
differences
in
age
and
sex
among
the
populations
the
relative
risk
of
being
a
victim
of
homicide
in
seattle
as
compared
to
vancouver
was
found
to
be
when
homicides
were
subdivided
by
the
mechanism
of
death
the
rate
of
homicide
by
knives
and
other
weapons
excluding
firearms
in
seattle
was
found
to
be
almost
identical
to
that
in
vancouver
virtually
all
of
the
increased
risk
of
death
in
seattle
was
due
to
a
more
than
fivefold
higher
rate
of
homicide
by
firearms
handguns
accounted
for
roughly
of
homicides
involving
firearms
handguns
were
times
more
likely
to
be
used
in
homicides
in
seattle
than
in
vancouver
the
authors
of
the
report
also
investigated
legally
justifiable
homicides
selfdefense
only
such
homicides
occurred
during
the
sevenyear
study
of
which
were
committed
by
police
only
cases
of
civilians
acting
in
selfdefense
occurrred
in
seattle
and
in
vancouver
only
involved
firearms
after
excluding
these
cases
there
was
virtually
no
impact
on
these
earlier
findings
this
is
i
feel
a
very
fair
report
one
might
even
make
the
argument
that
it
is
biased
against
canada
as
a
whole
because
vancouver
reports
annual
rates
of
homicide
two
to
three
times
that
of
ottawa
calgary
and
toronto
while
seattle
reports
annual
homicide
rates
only
half
to
twothirds
that
of
nyc
chicago
los
angeles
and
houston
critics
of
handgun
control
always
argue
that
limited
legal
access
to
handguns
will
have
little
effect
on
the
rates
of
homicide
because
persons
intent
on
killing
others
will
only
try
harder
to
acquire
a
gun
or
will
kill
by
other
means
this
report
shows
differently
if
the
rate
of
homicide
in
a
community
were
influenced
more
by
the
strength
of
intent
than
by
the
availability
of
weapons
we
could
expect
the
rate
of
homicides
by
weapons
other
than
guns
to
be
higher
in
vancouver
than
in
seattle
however
during
the
study
interval
vancouvers
rate
of
homicide
by
weapons
other
than
guns
was
not
significantly
higher
than
that
in
seattle
suggesting
that
few
wouldbe
assailants
switched
to
homicide
by
other
methods
as
well
ready
access
to
handguns
for
selfdefense
by
lawabiding
citizens
was
not
endorsed
in
this
report
although
seattle
did
experience
a
higher
rate
of
firearm
death
for
selfdefense
these
cases
accounted
for
less
than
of
the
homicides
in
both
cities
during
the
course
of
the
study
period
and
as
was
reported
seattle
apparently
didnt
enjoy
relief
from
any
crime
category
over
vancouver
because
citizens
may
legally
arm
themselves

selfdefense
