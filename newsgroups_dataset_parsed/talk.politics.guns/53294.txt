WERE

WAS

THE
RATE
OF

BY

AND
OTHER
WEAPONS
EXCLUDING
FIREARMS
IN

WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
TO
THAT
IN
VANCOUVER
VIRTUALLY
ALL
OF
THE
INCREASED
RISK
OF

IN

WAS
DUE
TO
A
MORE

FIVEFOLD
HIGHER

OF

THE

OF

ALSO

ONLY
SUCH

OCCURRED
DURING

WERE

OCCURRRED

ONLY
INVOLVED
FIREARMS
AFTER
EXCLUDING
THESE
CASES
THERE
WAS
VIRTUALLY
NO
IMPACT
ON
THESE
EARLIER
FINDINGS
THIS
IS
I
FEEL
A
VERY
FAIR
REPORT
ONE
MIGHT
EVEN
MAKE
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
IT
IS
BIASED
AGAINST
CANADA
AS
A
WHOLE
BECAUSE
VANCOUVER
REPORTS
ANNUAL
RATES
OF
HOMICIDE
TWO
TO
THREE
TIMES
THAT
OF
OTTAWA
CALGARY
AND
TORONTO
WHILE
SEATTLE
REPORTS
ANNUAL
HOMICIDE
RATES
ONLY
HALF
TO
TWOTHIRDS
THAT
OF
NYC
CHICAGO
LOS
ANGELES
AND
HOUSTON
CRITICS
OF
HANDGUN
CONTROL
ALWAYS
ARGUE
THAT
LIMITED
LEGAL
ACCESS
TO
HANDGUNS
WILL
HAVE
LITTLE
EFFECT
ON
THE
RATES
OF
HOMICIDE
BECAUSE
PERSONS
INTENT
ON
KILLING
OTHERS
WILL
ONLY
TRY
HARDER
TO
ACQUIRE
A
GUN
OR
WILL
KILL
BY
OTHER
MEANS
THIS
REPORT
SHOWS
DIFFERENTLY
IF
THE
RATE
OF
HOMICIDE
IN
A
COMMUNITY
WERE
INFLUENCED
MORE
BY
THE
STRENGTH
OF
INTENT
THAN
BY
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
WEAPONS
WE
COULD
EXPECT
THE
RATE
OF
HOMICIDES
BY
WEAPONS
OTHER
THAN
GUNS
TO
BE
HIGHER
IN
VANCOUVER
THAN
IN
SEATTLE
HOWEVER
DURING
THE

INTERVAL
VANCOUVERS
RATE
OF
HOMICIDE
BY
WEAPONS
OTHER
THAN

WAS
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
HIGHER
THAN
THAT
IN

SUGGESTING
THAT
FEW
WOULDBE
ASSAILANTS
SWITCHED
TO

BY
OTHER
METHODS
AS
WELL
READY
ACCESS
TO

FOR

WAS
NOT
ENDORSED
IN
THIS
REPORT
ALTHOUGH
SEATTLE
DID
EXPERIENCE
A
HIGHER

OF

FOR

THESE
CASES
ACCOUNTED
FOR
LESS
THAN
OF
THE

OF

AND
AS

SEATTLE
APPARENTLY
