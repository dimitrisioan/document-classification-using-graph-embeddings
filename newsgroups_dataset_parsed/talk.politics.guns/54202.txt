federal
martials
will
come
for
your
arms
no
one
will
help
you
you
are
more
dangerous
to
their
thinking
than
the
criminal
this
is
your
own
fault
the
amendment
is
dead
accept
this
find
another
way
you
know
in
many
ways
this
might
be
just
the
kick
we
need
to
straighten
things
out
in
this
country
also
people
would
have
a
need
to
replace
guns
with
something
else
perhaps
deadly
sprays
that
would
make
mace
and
oc
seem
like
water
they
would
be
lighter
and
easier
to
conceal
guns
are
really
old
in
design
and
as
long
as
we
have
tons
of
them
no
one
is
motivated
to
design
something
better
im
sure
we
could
come
up
with
some
real
nasty
stuff
if
we
tried
and
getting
rid
of
these
guns
would
get
us
moving
on
this
track
asap
this
is
what
we
really
want
right
stuff
thats
smaller
lighter
and
far
more
deadly
remember
in
this
country
well
really
scramble
to
accomplish
impossible
feats
if
we
are
motivated
enough
and
i
think
selfdefense
is
high
on
our
list
of
motivators
