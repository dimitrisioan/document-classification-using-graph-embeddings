RE
BATFFBI
MURDERS
ALMOST
EVERYONE
IN
WACO
TODAY
IN
ROBYCHOPINUDELEDU
SCOTT
W
ROBY
WRITES
AND
I
SUPPOSE
THE
FBI
ALSO
PREVENTED
THEM
FROM
COMING
OUT
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
UP
WHILE
NATIONAL
TV
CAMERAS
WATCH
WOULD
YOU
HAVE
COME
OUT
IF
YOU
KNEW
THE
ONLY
NATIONAL
TV
CAMERAS
WERE
WELL
OVER
A
MILE
AWAY
AND
YET
THE
AGENTS
WITH
THE
GUNS
WERE
ONLY
A
FEW
YARDS
AWAY
THEY
HAD
CONTACT
WITH
A
LAWYER
SO
I
AM
INCLINED
TO
BELIEVE
THEY
HAD
AN
IDEA
OF
WHAT
THEIR
SITUATION
ACTUALLY
WAS
THIS
ALSO
LEADS
TO
THE
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
THAT
THE
LAWYER
HAD
THE
BATF
PINNED
ON
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
IF
THE
BDS
ACTED
AS
WITNESSES
HENCE
THE
ARSON
I
DOUBT
THAT
ONE
TOO
BUT
IT
IS
STILL
QUITE
CLEAR
THAT
LEAVING
A
SAFE
PLACE
TO
SURRENDER
IS
A
RATHER
STUPID
THING
TO
DO
UNTIL
THAT
PLACE
IS
NO
LONGER
SAFE
DO
YOU
DISBELIEVE
EVERYTHING
THE
FBI
SAYS
AS
A
MATTER
OF
COURSE
GIVEN
HOW
THEYVE
ALLOWED
NO
OTHER
VIEWS
TO
BE
HEARD
ILL
RESERVE
JUDGEMENT
UNTIL
THE
TRIAL
BUT
SO
FAR
AS
THE
FBI
IS
CONCERNED
THEIR
STATEMENTS
CARRY
THE
SAME
AMOUNT
OF
WEIGHT
AS
PHOTONS
AT
REST
THE
BATF
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
DEVOID
OF
FAULT
IN
THE
HANDLING
OF
THIS
AFFAIR
BUT
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THEY
MAY
HAVE
INTENTIONALLY
STARTED
THE
FIRE
IS
LUDICROUS
LUDICROUS
YES
POSSIBLE
YES
PLAUSIBLE
GET
THE
JURY
IF
THE
FIRE
WERE
SET
BY
ACCIDENT
OR
BY
PEOPLE
OUTSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
I
WOULD
HAVE
EXPECTED
FAR
MORE
CULT
MEMBERS
TO
FLEE
THE
COMPOUND
OR
AT
LEAST
COME
OUT
SHOOTING
THATS
WHAT
GETS
ME
TOO
IT
IS
LIKELY
THE
CULT
MEMBERS
WERE
HOLED
UP
IN
AN
ENFORCED
PLACE
INSIDE
THE
BUILDING
WITH
A
DECENT
ARSON
ATTEMPT
I
SUSPECT
MANY
OF
THEM
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
TRAPPED
IN
ADDITION
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
CS
GAS
FOR
SEVERAL
HOURS
WOULD
HAVE
RENDERED
MANY
OF
THEM
IMMOBILE
IF
NOT
UNCONSCIOUS
WHEN
THEIR
MASKS
QUIT
ALL
THE
PROPS
ARE
THERE
BUT
PROVING
WHAT
SCENE
WAS
PLAYED
IS
DIFFICULT
THE
ONLY
CERTAINTY
IS
THAT
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
HAVE
FEW
WITNESSES
AGAINST
THEM
