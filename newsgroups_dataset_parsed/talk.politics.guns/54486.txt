RE
ATF
BURNS
DIVIDIAN
RANCH
NO
SURVIVORS
JUST
TO
SHED
SOME
LIGHT
ON
THE
FIRE
IT
WAS
WIDELY
REPORTED
AP
ETC
THAT
THERE
WERE
SEVERAL
WITNESSES
TO
BD
FOLKS
STARTING
THE
FIRES
IT
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
REPORTED
THAT
THE
FIRES
BROKE
OUT
IN
SEVERAL
PLACES
AT
ONCE
WHICH
RULES
OUT
A
BRADLEY
KNOCKING
OVER
A
LAMP
ETC
AS
THE
CAUSE
WHAT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
IS
SOME
SERIOUS
DISCUSSION
OF
THIS
INCIDENT
I
BELIEVE
THE
MOVES
MADE
WERE
RIGHT
AND
PROPER
BUT
I
STILL
HAVE
SOME
PROBLEMS
WITH
SOME
OF
THE
TACTICS
AFTER
WATCHING
THE
ABC
SPECIAL
ON
IT
TONIGHT
AS
WELL
AS
CNN
AND
NIGHTLINE
I
QUESTION
SOME
OF
THE
ATF
AND
FBI
ACTIONS
COULD
IT
HAVE
BEEN
POSSIBLE
TO
HAVE
TAKEN
KORESH
OUTSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
AT
SOME
TIME
BEFORE
THE
FEB
RAID
COULD
A
FURTHER
WAIT
HAVE
RESULTED
IN
A
DIFFERENT
OUTCOME
WERE
FBI
ACTIONS
BLARING
LOUDSPEAKERS
ETC
THE
RIGHT
COURSE
OF
ACTION
AND
A
FEW
OTHER
QUESTIONS
LIKE
I
SAID
I
BELIEVE
THE
ACTIONS
TAKEN
IN
GENERAL
WERE
PROPER
BUT
I
STILL
HAVE
SOME
RESERVATIONS
ONE
OTHER
POINT
IM
NO
FAN
OF
JANET
RENO
BUT
I
DO
LIKE
THE
WAY
SHE
HAD
THE
BALLS
TO
GO
AHEAD
AND
TAKE
FULL
RESPONSIBILITY
SEEMS
LIKE
THE
WAFFLE
BOY
HAD
PROBLEMS
FIGURING
OUT
JUST
WHERE
HE
STOOD
ON
THE
ISSUE
