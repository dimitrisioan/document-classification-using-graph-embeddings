re
news
says
batf
indictmentwarrant
unsealed
question
what
will
californians
do
with
all
those
guns
after
the
reginald
denny
trial
the
wall
street
journal
had
an
article
on
how
the
police
were
whining
about
all
the
new
guns
excuse
me
but
police
are
employees
of
the
government
rather
like
having
your
janitor
complain
about
job
conditions
i
say
californians
should
form
armed
block
clubs
that
would
engage
in
coordinated
strategies
should
batf
attempt
to
disarm
them
based
on
the
nefarious
tipster
theory
of
law
enforcement
unlike
waco
californians
should
be
able
to
destroy
armored
vehicles
in
city
streets
with
incendiary
weapons
acetylene
after
slowing
them
down
with
abandoned
car
blockades
garands
should
easily
outclass
batf
shock
troops
with
their
hk
smgs
and
there
should
be
enough
sony
walkmans
and
boom
boxes
to
overwhelm
any
fbi
psywar
operation
yes
a
good
time
would
be
had
by
all
billary
clinton
would
get
what
he
wanted
a
war
on
gunowners
the
batf
would
attempt
to
show
the
antigun
press
they
they
really
really
were
in
charge
with
a
charge
of
the
light
brigade
and
the
fbi
would
attempt
to
show
how
they
really
were
in
charge
by
asking
the
californian
national
guard
to
level
the
area
with
artillary
