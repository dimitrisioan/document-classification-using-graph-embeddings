WRITES
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
AUTOMOBILE
ACCIDENTS
BUT
ATLEAST
THERE
IS
SOME
REGULATION
TO
TRY
TO
COMBAT
THIS
WHEN
I
GOT
MY
DRIVERS
LICENSE
I
HAD
TO
TAKE
A
DRIVERS
SAFETY
CLASS
I
HAVE
TO
BE
LICENSED
TO
DRIVE
MY
CAR
MUST
BE
REGISTERED
I
MUST
AT
LEAST
WHERE
I
LIVE
HAVE
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
ON
BOTH
MYSELF
DRIVING
AND
MY
CAR
IF
SOMEONE
ELSE
HAD
AN
ACCIDENT
WITH
IT
HMM
WOULDNT
MANDITORY
SAFTEY
CLASSES
REGISTRATION
OF
BOTH
THE
OWNER
AND
GUN
AND
MANDITORY
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
BE
NICE
FOR
GUN
OWNERS
AS
IM
SURE
OTHERS
WILL
HAVE
POINTED
OUT
TO
YOU
BY
NOW
NONE
OF
THE
ABOVE
MEASURES
ARE
REQUIRED
FOR
YOU
ON
YOUR
OWN
PROPERTY
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
HAVE
A
LICENSE
YOUR
CAR
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
BE
REGISTERED
OR
INSPECTED
AND
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
HAVE
INSURANCE
OR
SAFETY
TRAINING
CLASSES
WHEN
YOU
OWN
AND
OPERATE
THAT
VEHICLE
ON
YOUR
OWN
PREMISES
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
THIS
DUBIOUS
ANALOGY
AT
LEAST
MAKE
IT
ACCURATE
AND
BY
THE
WAY
IN
TEXAS
YOU
CAN
DRIVE
A
CAR
IN
PUBLIC
WITH
THE
PROPER
CREDENTIALS
BUT
AN
ORDINARY
CIVILIAN
CANT
CARRY
A
GUN
LEGALLY
IN
PUBLIC
TO
SAVE
HISHER
LIFE
SO
I
WONT
EVEN
CONSIDER
REGISTRATION
MANADATORY
SAFETY
CLASSES
OR
MANADATORY
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
UNLESS
I
GET
A
FEDERAL
LAW
REPEALING
ALL
LOCAL
STATE
AND
FEDERAL
GUN
CONTROL
LAWS
WHICH
ABRIDGE
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
AND
A
NONDISCRETIONARY
FEDERAL
