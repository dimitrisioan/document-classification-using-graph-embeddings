YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
INDIVIDUALS
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
OWN
WEAPONS
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
WOULD
SUPPORT
A
NEIGHBORS
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
BIOLOGICAL
WEAPONS
AND
NERVE
GAS
ON
HISHER
PROPERTY
THAT
REALLY
DEPENDS
UPON
WHERE
YOU
DRAW
THE
LINE
WHILE
DEFINING
THESE
WEAPONS
THIS
MEANS
YOU
WOULD
SUPPORT
A
BAN
IF
IT
WERE
NARROW
ENOUGH
GOOD
AND
ALSO
ON
IF
YOU
INTEND
THE
LAW
TO
BE
REFLECTIVE
OF
MODERN
PRACTICE
FIVE
MONTHS
OR
FIVE
CENTURIES
DOWN
THE
ROAD
I
WOULD
HOPE
SO
LETS
DEFINE
A
NUCLEAR
WEAPON
AS
AN
EXPLOSIVE
WEAPON
WHOSE
MAJORITY
OF
ENERGY
COMES
FROM
FISSION
ANDOR
FUSION
OF
ATOMIC
NUCLEI
LETS
DEFINE
A
BIOLOGICAL
WEAPON
AS
LIVE
ORGANISMS
OR
VIRUSES
IN
SUCH
STATE
QUANTITY
AND
WITH
SUCH
A
VECTOR
THAT
THEY
COULD
CAUSE
DEATH
OR
SERIOUS
DISEASE
FURTHER
DEFINED
TO
A
SIGNIFICANT
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
IF
RELEASED
IN
A
CITY
SIMILARLY
POPULATED
AREA
RESEVOIR
OR
CROPLAND
NERVE
GAS
AND
MUSTARD
GAS
ARE
WELL
DEFINED
OTHER
POISONOUS
GASSES
SHOULD
BE
INDIVIDUALLY
BANNED
ONLY
IF
IT
CAN
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
USE
NOT
RELATED
TO
WEAPONRY
LICENSES
SHOULD
BE
AVAILABLE
FOR
RESEARCH
PURPOSES
ON
SUCH
CHEMICALS
I
AM
NOT
A
LAWYER
BUT
THESE
IDEAS
COULD
CERTAINLY
BE
A
BASIS
FOR
DEFINITIONS
ILL
GIVE
YOU
A
LITTLE
HINT
SEE
THAT
MANURE
PILE
IN
THE
FARMERS
FIELD
DOWN
THE
ROAD
IN
THE
USA
THAT
IS
A
WEAPON
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
NOPE
IT
IS
NOT
CONSIDERED
A
WEAPON
BIOLOGICAL
IN
NATURE
BECAUSE
IF
IT
GETS
WASHED
INTO
AN
OPEN
WELL
IT
WILL
CONTAMINATE
THE
AQUIFERS
THAT
SUPPLY
THOUSANDS
OF
CITIES
WITH
DRINKING
WATER
SO
WHERE
DO
YOU
DRAW
THE
LINE
IN
THE
USA
THE
EPA
HAS
RULED
THAT
A
PILE
OF
SCRAP
IRON
IS
ILLEGAL
CARE
TO
DRAW
A
THINNER
LINE
THIS
TIME
IT
IS
NOT
DEFINED
AS
A
WEAPON
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
MANY
THINGS
ARE
BANNED
FOR
OTHER
REASONS
