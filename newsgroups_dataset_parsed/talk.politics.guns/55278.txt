MICHAEL
MCCLARY
WRITES
LDS
AND
RLDS
PHILOSOPHY
IS
THAT
ALL
OTHER
RELIGIONS
HAVE
STRAYED
FROM
THE
TRUE
CHURCH
AS
SET
DOWN
BY
JESUS
BUT
THAT
GOD
WILL
JUDGE
EACH
ON
HIS
OWN
MERITS
IN
ADDITION
THE
RLDS
ALSO
CONTEND
AND
THE
LDS
MAY
AS
WELL
THAT
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
TRUE
WAY
TM
IS
AN
EXCUSE
YOU
CAN
ONLY
BE
CONDEMNED
IF
YOU
HAD
BEEN
TOUGHT
THE
WAY
AND
REJECTED
IT
IN
SHORT
LDS
AND
RLDS
SUFFER
EVERYBODY
FROM
LUTHERANS
TO
BUDDHISTS
SECURE
IN
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
WRONG
THEY
WILL
NOT
BE
PENALIZED
FOR
IGNORANCE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
QUITE
CORRECT
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THAT
LDS
IS
ENGAGED
ON
A
PROJECT
TO
CONVERT
THE
SOULS
OF
DECEASED
PERSONS
OF
OTHER
RELIGIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
SPARE
THEM
FROM
DAMNATION
AND
GAIN
THEM
ENTRANCE
INTO
HEAVEN
TO
THIS
END
THE
CHURCH
HAS
COMPILED
EXTENSIVE
GENAEOLOGICAL
RECORDS
SO
THAT
THEY
WILL
KNOW
THE
NAMES
OF
PEOPLE
TO
CONVERT
A
LONG
ARTICLE
IN
THE
NEW
YORKER
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
DESCRIBED
THE
LDS
RESEARCH
METHODS
IN
SOME
DETAIL
FOR
EXAMPLE
SOME
RESEARCHERS
PAY
VISITS
TO
LOCAL
NATIVE
STORYTELLERS
TO
LEARN
THE
NAMES
OF
PEOPLE
LONG
DEAD
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
JUST
THE
SORT
OF
LIE
THAT
WOULD
BE
MADE
UP
ABOUT
ANY
UNUSUAL
RELIGION
BUT
THE
NEW
YORKER
STORY
CONVINCED
ME
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
TRUTH
TO
IT
THE
NEW
YORKER
USED
TO
DO
EXTENSIVE
FACTCHECKING
AND
THE
STORY
WAS
QUITE
DETAILED
ARI
