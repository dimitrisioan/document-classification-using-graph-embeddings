RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
ALL
YOUR
POINTS
ARE
VERY
WELL
TAKEN
AND
THINGS
THAT
I
HAVENT
CONSIDERED
AS
I
AM
NOT
REALLY
FAMILIAR
ENOUGH
WITH
HANDGUNS
THATS
NOT
ALL
THAT
KRATZ
DOESNT
KNOW
HELL
A
GLOCK
IS
THE
LAST
THING
THAT
SHOULD
BE
SWITCHED
TO
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
I
KNOW
ABOUT
A
GLOCK
IS
THE
LACK
OF
A
REAL
SAFETY
ON
IT
SURE
THERE
IS
THAT
LITTLE
THING
IN
THE
TRIGGER
BUT
THAT
ISNT
TOO
GREAT
OF
A
SAFETY
NOW
WE
KNOW
THAT
KRATZ
DOESNT
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
A
SAFETY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
HE
ALSO
CONFUSES
THINGS
HE
CAN
SEE
WITH
THINGS
THAT
EXIST
GLOCKS
HAVE
MULTIPLE
SAFETIES
EVEN
THOUGH
ONLY
ONE
IS
VISIBLE
FROM
THE
OUTSIDE
A
SAFETY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
KEEP
THE
GUN
FROM
GOING
OFF
UNLESS
THATS
WHAT
THE
USER
WANTS
WITH
GLOCKS
ONE
SAYS
I
WANT
THE
GUN
TO
GO
OFF
BY
PULLING
THE
TRIGGER
IF
THE
SAFETIES
IT
HAS
MAKE
THAT
WORK
IT
HAS
A
REAL
SAFETY
NO
MATTER
WHAT
KRATZ
THINKS
ANDY
