I
HAVE
BEEN
CONVINCED
OF
THE
RIGHT
OF
AMERICANS
TO
AN
EFFECTIVE
SELFDEFENSE
BUT
SOMETHING
STRIKES
ME
AS
ODD
AMONG
THE
PRORKBA
ARGUMENTS
PRESENTED
HERE
THE
NUMBERS
COMPARING
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
INDEED
EVEN
A

DETERRING

LIKEWISE
THE

IT
IS
SURPRISING
THAT
THE

NEVER

ITS
ALWAYS
ALL

INCLUDES
CASES

ARE

IS
THIS

IT
WOULDNT
BE
UNREASONABLE
TO
SAY
THAT
IN

ALREADY
MEASURED
INVOLVING

THE
CONSEQUNCES
ARE
ALREADY

AND
IT
IS
SAFE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
A

NOT

INTO
A

WHEREAS
IN
