says
stuff
deleted
all
mine
define
armed
better
go
shoot
a
revolver
and
a
semiauto
like
the
colt
does
one
fires
faster
than
the
other
nope
aside
from
which
faster
rate
of
fire
is
usually
not
desirable
sure
it
makes
the
other
guys
duck
for
cover
but
just
you
trying
hitting
anything
with
a
thompson
in
hosemode
this
is
why
the
military
is
limiting
its
now
to
aw
come
on
it
worked
great
in
the
or
the
movie
version
of
the
anyways
burstfire
simple
semiauto
would
be
better
but
the
troops
like
to
be
able
to
rock
and
roll
even
if
it
is
wasteful
of
ammo
something
often
in
short
supply
when
the
enemy
is
plentiful
a
revolver
is
equally
capable
as
a
semiauto
in
the
same
caliber
stuff
deleted
about
how
revolvers
are
just
as
good
as
semiautos
all
your
points
are
very
well
taken
and
things
that
i
havent
considered
as
i
am
not
really
familiar
enough
with
handguns
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
anyone
who
goes
anyone
saying
that
the
criminals
obviously
outgun
the
police
dont
know
nothing
about
firearms
turn
off
cops
and
hunter
and
pay
attention
i
do
not
seek
here
to
say
semiautos
are
junk
merely
that
assuming
they
are
better
for
all
jobs
is
stupid
a
cop
with
a
revolver
on
his
hip
and
a
shotgun
in
the
rack
is
more
than
equipped
for
anything
short
of
a
riot
actually
i
dont
watch
those
shows
and
youre
right
at
least
partially
i
dont
know
much
about
handguns
im
more
familiar
with
rifles
gun
control
is
hitting
what
you
aim
at
if
you
whip
out
a
wondernine
and
fire
real
fast
you
may
find
you
dont
hit
anything
good
controlled
fire
from
a
revolver
is
more
likely
to
get
you
a
hit
i
own
a
beretta
myself
but
consider
it
inferior
as
a
carry
weapon
to
something
like
the
ruger
security
six
revolver
if
i
havent
hit
what
im
aiming
at
in
the
first
shots
something
is
quite
seriously
wrong
somewheres
while
i
might
like
having
the
backup
capacity
of
those
extra
shots
in
certain
cases
overwhelmingly
the
of
shots
fired
in
criminal
encounters
is
less
than
what
do
crooks
overwhelmingly
use
in
crime
why
the
same
nice
simple
revolvers
that
the
police
often
use
well
actually
some
police
prefer
the
much
heftier
magnum
but
anyway
obplea
dont
flame
me
i
prefer
semiautos
for
most
things
but
they
introduce
unneccessary
complications
to
something
as
nervewracking
as
an
abrupt
encounter
with
a
lone
criminal
if
everything
had
gone
as
planned
everything
would
have
been
perfect
batf
spokesperson
on
cnn
regarding
failed
raid
attempt
in
tx
no
flames
here
all
your
points
are
well
taken
guess
i
still
have
a
lot
to
learn
but
thanks
to
this
discussion
i
already
am
guess
i
assume
too
many
things
like
more
bullets
are
better
and
that
sort
of
thing
of
course
you
know
what
happens
when
you
assume
