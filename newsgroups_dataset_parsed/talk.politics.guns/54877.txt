ATF
NOT
ENOUGHT
TO
DO
THE
BEST
REASON
TO
ABOLISHING
THE
ATF
IS
THAT
THEY
DONT
HAVE
ENOUGH
TO
DO
IF
THE
ORGANIZATION
WERE
DISBANDED
AND
ITS
DUTIES
ASSIGNED
TO
THE
FBI
FIREARMS
AND
IRS
TOBACCO
AND
ALCOHOL
BOTH
OF
THESE
ORGANIZATIONS
HAVE
ENOUGH
TO
DO
THE
FBI
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
GOING
TO
TRY
TO
GET
A
CRIMINAL
CHARGE
OF
ILLEGAL
MACHINE
GUN
FOR
HAVING
A
BROKEN
GUN
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
POSTINGS
STATING
THAT
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
SHOULD
BE
DIVIDED
AND
AND
WEAK
BUT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
MORE
DANGEROUS
TO
LIBERTIES
THAN
A
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCY
WITHOUT
ENOUGH
CRIMINALS
TO
CHASE
THE
ATF
IS
ONE
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
TROUBLE
IT
STARTED
IN
WACO
ROD
ANDERSON
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THE
UNITED
STATES
GOVERNMENT
BOULDER
CO
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
FACT
THAT
A
BUNCH
OF
RCANDERSNYXCSDUEDU
FANATICS
DECIDED
TO
KILL
THEMSELVES
SATELLITE
