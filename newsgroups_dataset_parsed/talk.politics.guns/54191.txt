abuse
by
the
goverment
this
seems
to
be
one
of
the
main
problems
any
harder
guncontrol
would
just
be
abused
by
the
goverment
either
some
of
you
are
a
little
paranoid
no
offence
mr
parsli
i
have
to
take
exception
at
this
there
are
verifiable
previous
examples
of
levels
of
us
governments
abusing
guncontrol
restrictions
i
dont
think
it
is
paranoid
to
worry
that
what
has
been
abused
in
the
recent
past
might
be
abused
in
thye
future
after
so
many
times
of
getting
burned
any
sane
person
will
stop
putting
his
hand
on
the
stove
or
you
should
get
a
new
goverment
you
do
have
elections
id
love
to
but
as
long
as
the
politicians
grab
power
to
sell
pork
back
to
their
constituents
theres
not
a
lot
i
can
do
its
silly
to
suggest
that
if
theres
anything
we
cant
trust
the
government
to
do
and
therefore
the
government
should
be
allowed
to
do
it
then
we
should
change
governments
down
that
road
lies
total
government
power
ive
never
been
a
fan
of
totalitarianism
guns
n
criminals
most
weapons
used
by
criminals
today
are
stolen
this
is
very
likely
known
criminals
can
not
buy
weapons
thats
one
of
the
points
of
gun
control
and
because
gun
control
are
strict
in
whole
scandinavia
and
most
of
europe
we
dont
have
any
problem
with
smuggled
guns
the
north
american
continent
is
not
europe
no
matter
how
many
people
would
like
it
to
be
drugs
are
very
illegal
and
theyre
here
for
years
canada
has
crowed
about
its
gun
control
if
it
is
necessary
to
control
guns
over
the
whole
continent
then
canada
should
have
always
had
comparable
rates
to
the
us
yet
they
still
dont
unless
you
can
tell
me
why
the
canadian
border
is
so
much
more
magical
than
the
mexican
border
which
is
shorter
and
far
more
heavily
patrolled
then
i
really
cant
accept
that
argument
mixing
weapons
and
things
that
can
be
use
as
one
what
i
meant
was
that
cars
can
kill
but
they
are
not
guns
no
there
are
approximately
deaths
due
to
guns
in
the
us
twothirds
of
which
are
suicides
unfortunately
i
dont
have
suicide
rates
for
norway
however
this
makes
the
pergun
death
rate
about
half
the
percar
death
rate
the
issue
i
hope
i
think
we
all
agree
that
the
criminals
are
the
main
problem
guns
are
not
a
problem
but
the
way
they
are
used
is
and
what
are
they
for
i
think
this
discusion
is
interesting
when
you
think
of
exjugoslavia
they
should
all
have
weapons
its
their
rigth
to
have
them
and
if
they
use
them
to
kill
other
innocent
people
the
problem
is
humans
not
guns
the
problems
been
humans
since
before
we
had
stone
axes
the
fct
of
the
matter
is
simply
this
if
nobody
ever
assaulted
anybody
whether
there
is
a
weapon
of
any
sort
around
would
be
totally
irrelevent
yet
weapons
are
built
id
suggest
then
that
the
murderous
impulse
in
humanity
predates
weapons
anyway
the
bosnians
et
al
have
been
making
an
excellent
attempt
to
kill
each
other
for
half
a
thousand
years
taking
away
their
guns
even
if
we
could
would
neither
halt
the
killing
nor
reduce
the
brutality
if
of
all
murders
was
done
with
axes
would
you
impose
some
regulations
on
them
or
just
say
that
they
are
ment
to
be
used
at
trees
and
that
the
axe
is
not
a
problem
its
the
axer
an
example
dont
flame
me
just
because
not
exactly
are
killed
by
guns
in
the
us
approximately
of
murders
are
commited
with
firearms
with
handguns
with
nonhandguns
the
reason
i
say
that
guns
per
se
are
not
the
problem
is
that
our
nongun
rate
exceeds
most
of
europes
countries
entire
violent
crime
rate
i
dont
really
think
weve
got
more
knives
or
fists
in
any
case
i
think
examples
of
gun
control
applied
to
the
us
have
been
abkect
failures
just
like
drug
prohibition
and
other
forms
of
prohibition
until
you
deal
with
why
people
are
doing
what
they
are
doing
you
wont
solve
your
problem
and
if
the
problem
is
violent
crime
you
shouldnt
concentrate
on
the
tools
instead
the
vast
majority
of
guns
is
never
ever
misused
on
the
order
of
over
the
entire
lifetime
of
the
gun
this
says
to
me
that
you
cant
make
the
argument
that
the
gun
itself
causes
the
misuse
think
about
the
situation
in
los
angeles
where
people
are
buying
guns
to
protect
themselves
is
this
a
good
situation
the
situation
is
not
good
in
that
people
fear
for
their
lives
but
recall
the
scenes
of
the
storeowners
during
the
last
riots
protecting
their
shops
with
guns
would
it
have
been
better
they
too
lost
their
livelihoods
is
it
the
rigth
way
to
deal
with
the
problem
the
problem
of
poverty
and
rage
in
los
angeles
no
it
isnt
however
if
that
problem
becomes
a
violent
action
then
yes
it
can
be
appropriate
whether
or
not
some
person
has
been
hurt
by
their
condition
wont
make
me
less
dead
if
they
burn
down
my
house
with
me
in
it
you
have
to
examine
which
problem
youre
referring
to
if
youre
discussing
someone
violently
assaulting
you
then
it
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
response
to
make
them
stop
hopefully
simply
letting
them
know
youre
prepared
to
shoot
them
would
be
enough
as
it
was
with
the
abovementioned
storeowners
if
everybody
buys
guns
to
protect
themselves
from
criminals
and
their
neighbor
who
have
guns
what
do
you
think
will
happen
i
mean
if
everybody
had
a
gun
in
usa
of
households
have
some
form
of
firearm
usually
a
long
gun
that
accounts
for
a
level
of
access
for
at
least
million
americans
firearm
ownership
is
most
likely
among
educated
welloff
whites
the
group
least
likely
to
be
involved
in
violent
crime
you
may
take
that
for
what
its
worth
