make
a
new

called
talkpoliticsgunsparanoid
or
talkpoliticsgunstheyrheretotakemeaway
well
may
i
point
out
that
paranoia
is
an
irrational
fear
without
basis
in
reality
as
weve
seen
here
in
the
us
there
is
nothing
irrational
about
it
perhaps
you
folks
in
finland
have
been
down
on
your
knees
being
good
little
boys
and
girls
so
that
the
former
soviet
union
didnt
come
across
the
border
and
stomp
the
snot
out
of
you
for
so
long
that
you
just
figure
everybody
should
be
so
accomodating
to
tyranny
move
all
postings
about
waco
and
burn
to
guess
where
stop
posting
on
this
newsgroup
if
you
dont
like
us
talking
about
political
issues
involving
attacks
on
people
for
owning
guns
dont
read
talkpoliticsguns
we
are
all
so
glad
youre
trying
to
save
us
from
the
evil
goverment
but
would
you
mail
this
in
regular
mail
to
lets
say
people
nobodys
trying
to
save
you
from
anything
so
butt
out
i
couldnt
care
less
about
what
somebody
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
thinks
about
this
of
course
you
do
have
a
right
to
an
opinion
but
ive
always
figured
that
opinons
are
like
hemmorhoids
every
assholes
got
them

just
dont
care
about
yours
i

what
i
was
