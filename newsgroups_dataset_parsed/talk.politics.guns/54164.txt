JOHN
LAWRENCE
RUTLEDGE
WRITES
BUT
DO
YOU
KNEW
HOW
MUCH
ORGANIZATION
IS
REQUIRED
TO
TRAINING
A
LARGE
GROUP
OF
POEPLE
TWICE
A
YEAR
JUST
TO
TRY
TO
GET
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
EVERY
YEAR
PROVIDE
A
BASIC
TRAINING
TO
NEW
PEOPLE
SO
THEY
CAN
BE
INTEGRATED
INTO
THE
FORCE
AND
FIND
A
SUITABLE
LOCATION
IT
REQUIRES
A
CONTINUALLY
STANDING
COMMITTEE
OF
ORGANIZERS
AGAIN
MY
RESPONSE
IS
SO
WHAT
IS
MR
RUTLEDGE
ARGUING
THAT
SINCE
THE
LOCAL
AND
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENTS
HAVE
ABANDONED
THEIR
CHARTER
TO
SUPPORT
SUCH
ACTIVITY
AND
PASSED
LAWS
PROHIBITING
PRIVATE
ORGANIZATIONS
FROM
DOING
SO
THAT
THEY
HAVE
ELIMINATED
THE
BASIS
FOR
THE
RKBA
ON
THE
CONTRARY
TO
ANYONE
WHO
UNDERSTANDS
THE
GAME
THEY
HAVE
STRENGTHENED
IT
NO
I
ORIGINALLY
ARGUED
THAT
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
WAS
A
LITTLE
BIT
AND
AN
ANACHRONISM
THESE
PROHIBITING
LAWS
ARE
EXAMPLES
WHY
THE
ARE
AN
ANACHRONISM
AFTER
ALL
LAWS
IN
MADE
BY
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THESE
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALREADY
DECIDED
THAT
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
DOES
NOT
APPLY
OR
IS
TOO
BROAD
IN
SOME
CASES
SINCE
THESE
REPRESENTATIVES
FEEL
AN
UNCONDITIONAL
INTERPRETATION
IS
NOT
WANTED
THEN
IT
IS
PROBABLE
THAT
THEY
MAJORITY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
FEEL
THE
SAME
WAY
IF
THIS
IS
SO
IT
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
USING
THEIR
POWER
OF
GOVERNMENT
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
HOW
THE
PEOPLE
FEEL
THE
PEOPLE
SHOULD
STAND
UP
AND
STATE
THEIR
WISHES
MOX
NIX
MR
RUTLEDGE
YOU
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONE
HERE
CLAIMING
THAT
THE
RKBA
IS
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
TOPFLIGHT
WELLREGULATED
MILITIA
WHY
THIS
IS
A
FALSE
ASSUMPTION
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
POSTED
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
NO
I
SIMPLE
STATED
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
JOIN
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
AND
I
HAVE
ALSO
STATED
THAT
A
MILITIA
THAT
MEETS
ONCE
OR
TWICE
A
YEAR
IS
CLEARLY
WELL
ORGANIZED
AND
THIS
STATE
OF
READINESS
THAT
I
HAVE
CLAIMED
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
IS
THE
SAME
STATE
OF
READINESS
EXPECTED
OF
THE
MILITIA
AS
STATED
BY
HAMILTON
IF
ONLY
IT
WERE
A
MODERN
DOCUMENT
WITH
A
JOHN
LAWRENCE
RUTLEDGE
SMART
INDEX
AND
HYPER
LINKS
STRETCHING
ALL
RESEARCH
ASSISTANT
THROUGH
THE
WORLD
DATA
NET
IT
WAS
TERRIBLY
FRUSTRATING
TO
FLIP
BACK
AND
FORTH
BETWEEN
INTERACTIVE
MEDIA
GROUP
THE
PAGES
AND
CRUDE
FLAT
ILLUSTRATIONS
THAT
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
DEPARTMENT
NEVER
EVEN
MOVED
NOR
WERE
THERE
ANIMATED
UMASS
LOWELL
ARROWS
OR
ZOOMINS
IT
COMPLETELY
LACKED
A
UNIVERSITY
AVE
FOR
SOUND
LOWELL
MA
MOST
BAFFLING
OF
ALL
WAS
THE
PROBLEM
OF
NEW
WORDS
IN
NORMAL
TEXT
YOUD
ONLY
HAVE
TO
TOUCH
AN
UNFAMILIAR
WORD
AND
THE
DEFINITION
JRUTLEDGCSULOWELLEDU
