rate
per

rate
the
uk
is
more
dangerous
though
you
may
be
less
likely
to
be
killed
by
a
handgun
the
average
individual
citizen
in
the
uk
is
twice
as
likely
to
be
killed
by
whatever
means
as
the
average
swiss
would
you
feel
any
better
about
being
killed
by
means
other
than
a
handgun
i
wouldnt
what
an
absurd
argument
switzerland
is
onefifth
the
size
of
the
uk
with
oneeigth
as
many
people
therefore
at
any
given
point
on
swiss
soil
you
are
more
likely
to
be
crow
bait
more
importantly
you
are
as
likely
to
be
killed
by
the
next
stranger
approaching
you
on
a
swiss
street
than
in
the
uk
killed
by
handgun
or
killed
if
im
dead
i
dont
much
care
if
it
was
by
being
shot
or
stabbed
to
death
you
are
betraying
your
lack
of
understanding
about
rate
versus
total
number
rates
are
expressed
often
as
population
therefore
if
a
place
had
deaths
and
a
population
of
the
rate
would
be
a
place
that
had
deaths
and
a
population
of
would
hav
a
rate
of
the
former
has
a
higher
rate
the
latter
a
higher
total
you
are
less
likely
to
die
in
the
latter
simple
enuff
for
chrissakes
take
out
your
calculator
and
work
out
the
numbers
here
ive
preformatted
them
for
you
to
make
it
easier

then
tell

how

oo
i
dont
think
you
can
get
an
accurate
indicator
of
how
safe
england
is
compared
to
switzerland
by
concentrating
only
on
handgun
murders
and
completely
ignoring
murders
by
other
weapons
not
to
mention
the
rate
of
other
violent
crimes
if
there
are
more
guns
in
circulation
if
follows
that
more
people
will
be
killed
with
them
cause
they
are
available
to
the
person
intent
on
committing
a
crime
regardless
of
whether
they
have
to
do
it
with
a
gun
knife
or
bare
hands
the
gun
control
lobby
doesnt
seem
to
understand
this
point
if
people
are
intent
on
committing
a
crime
they
will
do
it
with
whatever
means
are
available
to
them
