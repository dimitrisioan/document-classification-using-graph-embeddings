thats
all
very
well
and
good
but
i
was
refering
to
all
homocides
not
just
ones
involving
handguns
what
is
this
fixation
on
death
by
shooting
as
if
it
were
somehow
worse
than
death
by
stabbing
what
relevance
are
all
homicides
in
this
debate
what
do
you
think
gun
control
advocates
are
saying
that
if
we
get
rid
of
all
handguns
we
will
live
in
a
homicidefree
world
the
relevance
is
that
if
youve
got
x
homicides
and
reduce
the
number
of
gun
homicides
in
that
group
but
x
doesnt
decrease
by
a
significant
amount
have
you
made
an
improvement
and
is
that
improvement
worth
what
youve
paid
the
issue
is
guns
not
baseball
bats
even
a
simpleton
knows
that
he
stands
a
better
chance
of
surviving
an
attack
with
a
baseball
bat
certainly
of
outrunning
a
batwielding
assailant
if
a
baseball
bat
is
a
tenth
as
likely
to
kill
a
victim
as
a
gun
is
that
any
comfort
to
that
tenth
as
for
knives
see
my
earlier
post
id
much
rather
face
a
knife
than
a
gun
thanks
ive
faced
a
knife
and
i
was
damn
annoyed
i
didnt
have
a
gun
all
the
statistics
in
the
world
didnt
change
the
fact
that
he
was
interested
in
cutting
me
fortunately
the
best
defense
against
a
knife
isnt
another
knife
anyone
trained
in
unarmed
selfdefense
wont
have
much
of
a
problem
disarming
a
knife
assailant
untrained
in
knife
assault
which
probably
means
of
knife
assailants
anyone
trained
in
selfdefense
unarmed
selfdefense
isnt
for
everyone
whats
more
it
requires
substantially
more
training
to
be
safe
and
effective
than
a
firearm
it
requires
physical
proximity
and
thus
a
greater
threat
to
the
victim
which
is
a
primary
problem
with
stun
guns
you
have
to
actually
touch
your
assailant
unless
youre
very
good
a
large
stronger
assailant
can
simply
ignore
your
blows
long
enough
to
incapacitate
you
