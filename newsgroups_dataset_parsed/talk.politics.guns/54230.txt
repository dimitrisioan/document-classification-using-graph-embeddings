RE
CLINTON
WANTS
NATIONAL
ID
CARD
AKA
USSRSTYLE
INTERNAL
PASSPORT
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
BTW
WHICH
PARTS
SHOULD
BE
SECURE
CRIMINAL
RECORDS
IE
CONVICTIONS
ARE
TYPICALLY
CONSIDERED
PUBLIC
INFORMATION
SO
SHOULD
THAT
INFO
BE
SECURE
REMEMBER
THE
POPULATION
INCLUDES
PARENTS
CHECKING
PROSPECTIVE
CHILDCARE
WORKER
LIKE
I
SAID
IM
NOT
SURE
OF
THE
DETAILS
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
COULD
ACCESS
MEDICAL
INFORMATION
WITHOUT
GIVING
OUT
A
NAME
OR
ANY
OTHER
INFORMATION
MEDICAL
INFO
WITHOUT
A
NAMEBODY
ATTACHED
IS
COMPLETELY
USELESS
FOR
TREATMENT
THE
ARTICLE
I
MENTIONED
THE
THE
EARLIER
POST
DESCRIBED
A
DEBIT
CARD
TYPE
TRANSACTION
IN
WHICH
NEITHER
THE
STORE
NOR
THE
BANK
KNEW
WHO
WAS
WITHDRAWING
THE
MONEY
THUS
MAKING
IT
AS
SECURE
AS
CASH
FOR
SOME
PURPOSES
BUT
FAR
LESS
SECURE
FOR
OTHERS
PARENTS
CHECKING
A
BABYSITTER
SHOULDNT
NEED
ACCESS
TO
THE
INFORMATION
STORED
IN
THE
CARD
SURE
THEY
DO
THE
PROSPECTIVE
SITTER
MAY
HAVE
A
NASTY
HABIT
OF
MOLESTING
KIDS
THREE
OR
FOUR
MONTHS
INTO
THE
JOB
THE
REFERENCES
MAY
NOT
HAVE
KNOWN
HIM
LONG
ENOUGH
OR
MAY
NOT
HAVE
PICKED
UP
ON
THIS
YET
REMEMBER
CRIMINAL
CONVICTION
INFO
IS
PUBLIC
SO
IF
YOURE
GOING
TO
ARGUE
FOR
AN
ID
CARD
OTHER
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
A
STRONG
ARGUMENT
THAT
IT
DISCLOSE
PUBLIC
INFO
THINGS
I
THINK
ANYTHING
THAT
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
KEEP
UNKNOWN
SHOULD
BE
THUS
MAKING
IT
USELESS
FOR
NEGATIVE
INFORMATION
COULD
HAVE
IT
SO
THAT
ONLY
DOCTORS
CAN
ACCESS
MEDICAL
INFORMATION
POLICE
CRIMINAL
RECORDS
ETC
ETC
YEAH
RIGHT
HOW
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
KEEP
DOCTORS
FROM
SPILLING
THE
BEANS
WE
ALREADY
KNOW
THAT
YOU
CANT
KEEP
COPS
FROM
DISCLOSING
INFO
BUT
AT
LEAST
THAT
INFO
IS
TYPICALLY
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
PUBLIC
ANYWAY
LIKE
I
SAID
ITS
BEST
IF
YOU
READ
THE
ARTICLE
FOR
YOURSELF
THE
ARTICLE
DISCUSSES
TECHNOLOGY
NOT
APPROPRIATE
POLICY
IT
ALSO
FAILS
TO
DEAL
WITH
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
THE
FOLKS
WITH
THE
SECRETS
BLAB
ANDY
