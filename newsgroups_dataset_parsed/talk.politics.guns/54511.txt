BUT
DO
YOU
KNEW
HOW
MUCH
ORGANIZATION
IS
REQUIRED
TO
TRAINING
A
LARGE
GROUP
OF
POEPLE
TWICE
A
YEAR
JUST
TO
TRY
TO
GET
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
EVERY
YEAR
PROVIDE
A
BASIC
TRAINING
TO
NEW
PEOPLE
SO
THEY
CAN
BE
INTEGRATED
INTO
THE
FORCE
AND
FIND
A
SUITABLE
LOCATION
IT
REQUIRES
A
CONTINUALLY
STANDING
COMMITTEE
OF
ORGANIZERS
AGAIN
MY
RESPONSE
IS
SO
WHAT
IS
MR
RUTLEDGE
ARGUING
THAT
SINCE
THE
LOCAL
AND
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENTS
HAVE
ABANDONED
THEIR
CHARTER
TO
SUPPORT
SUCH
ACTIVITY
AND
PASSED
LAWS
PROHIBITING
PRIVATE
ORGANIZATIONS
FROM
DOING
SO
THAT
THEY
HAVE
ELIMINATED
THE
BASIS
FOR
THE
RKBA
ON
THE
CONTRARY
TO
ANYONE
WHO
UNDERSTANDS
THE
GAME
THEY
HAVE
STRENGTHENED
IT
NO
I
ORIGINALLY
ARGUED
THAT
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
WAS
A
LITTLE
BIT
AND
AN
ANACHRONISM
THESE
PROHIBITING
LAWS
ARE
EXAMPLES
WHY
THE
ARE
AN
ANACHRONISM
AFTER
ALL
LAWS
IN
MADE
BY
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THESE
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALREADY
DECIDED
THAT
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
DOES
NOT
APPLY
OR
IS
TOO
BROAD
IN
SOME
CASES
SINCE
THESE
REPRESENTATIVES
FEEL
AN
UNCONDITIONAL
INTERPRETATION
IS
NOT
WANTED
THEN
IT
IS
PROBABLE
THAT
THEY
MAJORITY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
FEEL
THE
SAME
WAY
IF
THIS
IS
SO
IT
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
USING
THEIR
POWER
OF
GOVERNMENT
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
HOW
THE
PEOPLE
FEEL
THE
PEOPLE
SHOULD
STAND
UP
AND
STATE
THEIR
WISHES
WRONG
NEGLECTING
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
MEDIA
HAVE
BULLSHITTED
THE
PEOPLE
ALMOST
NONSTOP
ON
THIS
ISSUE
CONSTITUTIONAL
LIMITATIONS
ARE
THERE
TO
PREVENT
A
TYRRANY
OF
THE
MAJORITY
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
MAJORITY
COULD
VOTE
THAT
GIVEN
ETHNICS
HAVE
NO
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
PEOPLE
ETC
AND
IT
WOULD
FLY
USING
THE
LOGIC
ABOVE
WHEN
GOVERNMENT
FEELS
THE
CONSTITUTION
IS
NOT
RIGHT
FOR
THE
TIMES
THERE
IS
A
PROCEDURE
CALLED
AN
AMENDMENT
TO
THE
CONSTITUTION
THIS
IS
DELIBERATELY
DIFFICULT
AND
CUMBERSOME
TO
PREVENT
ABUSE
OF
THOSE
WHO
DECIDE
TO
IGNORE
THE
PEOPLE
OR
IMPOSE
UNJUST
POLICIES
OF
A
MAJORITY
ON
A
MINORITY
A
LYNCH
MOB
IS
A
MAJORITY
REMEMBER
OUTVOTING
THE
HANGEE
WHAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
DOING
ARE
VIOLATIONS
ENDRUNS
AROUND
THE
LIMITATIONS
ON
THE
GOVERNMENT
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
THEY
KNOW
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WOULD
BE
VERY
HARD
TO
CONVINCE
THAT
A
GOOD
INTENTION
IS
BEHIND
TAMPERING
WITH
THE
BILL
OF
RIGHTS
GOVERNMENT
PROPEGANDA
ON
GUNS
HAS
BEEN
VERY
STRONG
AND
PERSISTANT
BUT
NOT
THAT
STRONG
AND
IT
JUST
SHOWS
HOW
GULLIBLE
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
BECOME
TO
I
AM
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
AM
HERE
TO
HELP
YOU
SORT
OF
LINE
WE
HAVE
BEEN
LIED
TO
FED
HALF
TRUTHS
RIGGED
STATS
WHILE
THE
GOVERNMENT
KNOWS
THEIR
CONTROL
LAWS
HAVE
NO
EFFECT
ON
CRIME
THEY
WANT
A
GOVERNMENT
MONOPOLY
ON
FORCE
PURE
AND
SIMPLE
DO
YOU
REALLY
WANT
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
OVERRIDE
CONSTITUTIONAL
LIMITATIONS
BY
A
SIMPLE
VOTE
OF
A
BUNCH
OF
ELITISTS
CONGRESSCRITTERS
I
SURE
DONT
THE
FOUNDING
FATHERS
SURE
AS
HELL
DIDNT
EITHER
MOX
NIX
MR
RUTLEDGE
YOU
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONE
HERE
CLAIMING
THAT
THE
RKBA
IS
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
TOPFLIGHT
WELLREGULATED
MILITIA
WHY
THIS
IS
A
FALSE
ASSUMPTION
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
POSTED
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
NO
I
SIMPLE
STATED
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
JOIN
A
WELL
ORGANIZED
MILITIA
AND
I
HAVE
ALSO
STATED
THAT
A
MILITIA
THAT
MEETS
ONCE
OR
TWICE
A
YEAR
IS
CLEARLY
WELL
ORGANIZED
AND
THIS
STATE
OF
READINESS
THAT
I
HAVE
CLAIMED
THE
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
IS
THE
SAME
STATE
OF
READINESS
EXPECTED
OF
THE
MILITIA
AS
STATED
BY
HAMILTON
YOU
BETTER
READ

THE

REGARDING
THE
