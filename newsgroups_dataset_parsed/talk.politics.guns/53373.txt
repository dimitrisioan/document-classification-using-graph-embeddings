THANKS
TO
THE
NRA
THE
ATF
IS
PROHIBITED
FROM
RESEARCHING
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
USING
TAGGANTS
IN

ARE
A
CHEAP

TECHNOLOGICALLY
FEASIBLE
MICROSCOPIC

WANT
THIS
MAN
TO
TELL
ME
HOW
IN
THE

YOU
CAN
TAKE
THE
EXPLOSIVES
USED
IN
THE
WTC
BOMBING
CONSIDERING
THAT
THE
CONSENSUS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
THE
EXPLOSIVE

A

WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
AS
IMPOSSIBLE
AS
SEMANTIC
ANALYSIS
OF

BY
MEANS
OF
TAGGANTS
THE
DIFFICULTY
IN
BOTH
CASES
BEING
TO
HAVE
PERSUADED
THE
BULL
TO
CONSUME
THE
TAGGANTS
