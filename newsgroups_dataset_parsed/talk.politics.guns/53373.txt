thanks
to
the
nra
the
atf
is
prohibited
from
researching
the
effectiveness
of
using
taggants
in
explosives
taggants
are
a
cheap
and
technologically
feasible
microscopic
additive
that
would
help
investigators
at
crime
scenes
like
the
world
trade
center
bombing
trace
the
explosives
involved
i
want
this
man
to
tell
me
how
in
the
hell
you
can
take
the
explosives
used
in
the
wtc
bombing
considering
that
the
consensus
seems
to
be
that
the
explosive
was
a
fertilizerbased
one
proper
counter
to
this
claim
forensic
analysis
of
the
wtc
bomb
by
means
of
taggants
would
have
been
as
impossible
as
semantic
analysis
of
nyt
editorials
by
means
of
taggants
the
difficulty
in
both
cases
being
to
have
persuaded
the
bull
to
consume
the
taggants
before
production
