WRITES
OH
HOW
ABOUT
THE
PRESS
IF
THE
BATF
FBI
WERE
GOING
TO
SHOOT
PEOPLE
LEAVING
A
BURNING
BUILDING
DONT
YOU
THINK
THEY
WOULD
GET
RID
OF
THE
PRESS
FIRST
OH
YOU
MEAN
SOMETHING
LIKE
MOVING
THE
PRESS
BACK
TO
A
SINGLE
LOCATION
MILES
AWAY
FROM
THE
COMPOUND
THE
PRESS
WAS
ALLOWING
THAT
DOESNT
COUNT
AS
GETTING
RID
OF
THE
PRESS
GETTING
RID
OF
THE
PRESS
WOULD
MEAN
GETTING
THEM
FAR
ENOUGH
AWAY
SO
THAT
THEY
WOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
SEE
WHAT
