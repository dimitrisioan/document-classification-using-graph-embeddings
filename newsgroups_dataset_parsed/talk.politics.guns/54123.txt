PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHEN
THIS

WILL
DRY
UP
DRUGS
ARE
EASIER
TO
MANUFACTURE
EASIER
TO
SMUGGLE
EASIER
TO

BEVERAGES
BOTTLES
OF
WHISKEY
ARE
LARGER
HEAVIER
AND
MORE
FRAGILE
THAN
BAGS
OF
DRUGS
BARRELS
AND
KEGS
ARE
LARGER
AND
HEAVIER
STILL
AND
ARE
DIFFICULT
TO
MANIPULATE
YET
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
MANAGED
TO
GET
VERY
RICH
OFF
OF
THE
SMUGGLING
OF
BOOZE
INTO
THIS
COUNTRY
DURING
THE
YEARS
OF
PROHIBITION
THERE
WAS
A
DEMAND
SO
AN
ENTIRE
INDUSTRY
FORMED
TO
SUPPLY
IT
IF
ALCOHOL
WERE
AGAIN
BANNED
TODAY
IT
WOULD
BE
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
MANAGE
A
LARGESCALE
SMUGGLING
OPERATION
THE
COPS
NOW
RANK
JUST
A
NARROW
NOTCH
BELOW
THE
MILITARY
IN
COMMUNICATIONS
INTELLIGENCE
GATHERING
AND
FIREPOWER
IN
A
SIMILAR
VEIN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
MARIJUANA
SMUGGLED
INTO
THIS
COUNTRY
HAS
GREATLY
DECREASED
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
ITS
VALUEPERPOUND
IS
VERY
LOW
WHEN
COMPARED
TO
COCAINE
OR
HEROIN
ITS
SIMPLY
NOT
WORTH
THE
RISK
ITS
UNECONOMICAL
NOW
MOST
REEFER
IS
DOMESTIC
THERE
IS
LESS
PRESSURE
ON
THE
DOMESTIC
PRODUCER
SHOWY
RAIDS
NOTWITHSTANDING
AND
THUS
IT
IS
ECONOMICAL
HERES
A
QUESTION
IF
MOST
MARIJUANA
IS
DOMESTIC
AND
PRODUCING
IT
HERE
IS
ECONOMICAL
WHY
WOULD
WE
EXPECT
IT
TO
BE
IMPORTED
OF
NOTE
THOUGH
DOMESTIC
REEFER
IS
NOW
VERY
STRONG
SO
A
SMALL
VOLUME
GOES
A
LONG
WAY
YOU
CANNOT
MAKE
ALCOHOL
STRONGER
THAN
PROOF
NOT
A
GOOD
DOLLARPOUND
DEAL
YET
IT
WAS
DONE
DONE
QUITE
SUCCESSFULLY
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
SOMEBODY
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
WORTH
THE
RISK
FIREARMS
TEND
TO
FALL
INTO
THIS
LOW
DOLLARPOUND
AREA
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
ECONOMIC
TO
SMUGGLE
THEM
IN
YOUR
ASSUMPTION
IS
THAT
THIS
LOW
DOLLARPOUND
AREA
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
LOW
AS
TO
MAKE
GUNRUNNING
UNPROFITABLE
ON
WHAT
DO
YOU
BASE
THIS
AND
GIVEN
THAT
SMUGGLING
CHANNELS
ARE
ALREADY
ESTABLISHED
AND
GIVEN
THE
ECONOMIES
OF
SCALE
WOULD
IT
REALLY
ADD
SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE
EXPENSE
TO
START
SMUGGLING
FIREARMS
ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING
DOING
SO
WOULD
BE
LESS
HAZARDOUS
IN
TERMS
OF
GETTING
CAUGHT
THAN
DRUGS
ALL
PRODUCTION
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
LOCAL
NOW
THAT
WAS
A
JUMP
IN
ANY
CASE
DEFINE
LOCAL
ITS
A
BIG
COUNTRY
THERE
ARE
NOT
ALL
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BOTH
THE
SKILL
AND
MOTIVATION
TO
ASSEMBLE
WORTHWHILE
FIREARMS
FROM
SCRATCH
HIGHRANKING
CRIME
FIGURES
COULD
OBTAIN
IMPORTED
UZIS
AND
SUCH
BUT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON

AVERAGE

WOULD
BE
LUCKY
TO
GET
A

WOULD

FOR
IT
WOW
YOU
GOTTA
LOVE
THE
SPECULATION
AS
I
POSTED

IMPORT
BILLIONS
UPON
BILLIONS
OF
RAW
ORES

NOT
ONLY
THAT
BUT
SHIPS
COME
IN
AND
OUT
OF
US
HARBORS
EVERY

FULL
STUFF
AND

DOESNT
EVEN
HAVE
THE
EXTRA
ADVANTAGE
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
SNIFF
THEM
OUT
ID
BE
WILLING
TO
WAGER
THAT
A
SHIPLOAD
OF
HANDGUNS
WOULD
BE
WORTH
MORE
THAN
A
SHIPLOAD
OF
RAW
ORE
AND
YOURE
VIRTUALLY
GUARANTEED
TO
GET
IT
PAST
CUSTOMS
BECAUSE
THEYD
HAVE
TO
HAND
SEARCH
EVERY
HOLD
OF
EVERY
SHIP
WHICH
CAME
THROUGH
ITS
NOT
SIMPLY
A
MATTER
OF
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
ARE
THEY
WORTH
BUT
HOW
MUCH
MORE
MONEY
ARE
THEY
WORTH
THAN
OTHER
GOODS
BASED
ON
THE
LIKELIHOOD
OF
BEING
CAUGHT
LESS
MONEY
THAN
DRUGS
BUT
ALSO
A
SAFER
