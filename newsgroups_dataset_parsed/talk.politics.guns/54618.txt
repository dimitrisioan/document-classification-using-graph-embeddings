GUN
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WILL
HOPEFULLY
HAVE
AN
IMPACT
ON
ACCIDENTAL
SHOOTINGS
ESPECIALLY
YOUTHS
DOMESTIC
DISPUTES
WHERE
A
GUN
IS
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
HEAT
OF
EMOTION
AND
ANGER
AND
MAYBE
KEEP
A
FEW
GUNS
FROM
BEING
STOLEN
AND
LATER
USED
IN
STREETLEVEL
CRIME
WHAT
GIVES
YOU
THE
IDEA
THAT
GUN
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WILL
HAVE
AN

ANY
OF
THESE
THINGS
EVIDENCE
PLEASE
PLEASE
DONT
MISINTERRET
WHAT
I
WAS
SAYING
JOE
I
WAS
MAKING
THE
POINT
THA
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
EFFECT
OF
GUN
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
BUT
HOPEFULLY
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
EFFECT
IT
MAY
PREVENT
INJURIES
OR
DEATHS
IN
ONE
OF
THESE
TYPES
OF
COMMON
INCIDENTS
SAYING
HOPEFULLY
THE
EFFECT
OF
POLICY
X
WILL
BE
Y
IS
MUCH
DIFFERENT
FROM
SAYING
HOPEFULLY
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
EFFECT
OF
POLICY
X
IT
WILL
BE
Y
HERE
YOUVE
MADE
BOTH
STATEMENTS
IF
THE
FORMER
DESCRIBES
A
REASONABLYLIKELY
OUTCOME
OF
POLICY
X
THEN
PERHAPS
POLICY
X
IS
WORTHY
OF
CONSIDERATION
BUT
THE
LATTER
STATEMENT
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
TO
BASE
POLICY
DECISIONS
ON
FIREARMS
ARE
THE
FIFTHLEADING
CAUSE
OF
UNINTENTIONAL
DEATHS
AMONG
CHILDREN
AGES
AND
UNDER
ACCORDING
TO
GROUPS
LIKE
THE
CENTER
TO
PREVENT
HANDGUN
VIOLENCE
FORMERLY
THE
NATIONAL
COALITION
TO
BAN
HANDGUNS
INTERESTING
NAME
CHANGE
DONT
YOU
THINK
WHO
INCLUDE
MURDER
AND
SUICIDE
BY
FIREARMS
IN
THE
LEADING
CAUSES
OF
UNINTENTIONAL
DEATH
FIGURES
BUT
DONT
INCLUDE
MURDER
AND
SUICIDE
BY
OTHER
MEANS
AS
CAUSES
OF
UNINTENTIONAL
DEATH
CANT
YOU
SEE
PAST
THE
BULLSHIT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THE
RATIO
TO
OTHER
ACCIDENTAL
DEATHS
IS
IMPORTANT
SO
GUNS
DONT
KILL
AS
MANY
CHILDREN
AS
CAR
ACCIDENTS
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
SEVERITY
BETWEEN
DEATHS
AND
DEATHS
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
USE
ACCIDENTAL
GUNRELATED
DEATHS
AMONG
CHILDREN
AS
A
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
GUN
CONTROL
WHO
NEEDS
TO
BE
CONVINCED
THAT
ACCIDENTAL
GUN
DEATHS
OF
CHILDREN
IS
A
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
I
ASSUMED
THAT
ANY
HUMANE
PERSON
WOULD
BE
CONCERNED
WHEN
ANY
YEAR
OLD
GOT
HOLD
OF
THEIR
PARENTS
GUN
FROM
THEIR
BEDROOM
DRAWER
AND
ACCIDENTLY
BLEW
AWAY
ONE
OF
THEIR
FRIENDS
CERTAINLY
ACCIDENTAL
DEATHS
BY
ANY
CAUSE
ARE
SERIOUS
THINGS
BUT
THE
ANTIGUN
GROUPS
INSIST
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
THAT
ACCIDENTAL
DEATH
BY
FIREARMS
IS
A
STASTICALLY
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
AND
EVEN
IF
YOU
DONT
USE
THESE
DEATHS
AS
A
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
GUN
CONTROL
THESE
GROUPS
DO
IM
SORRY
IF
I
JUMPED
TO
CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT
YOUR
REASON
FOR
MENTIONING
ACCIDENTAL
DEATHS
DUE
TO
FIREARMS
BEING
SOMETHING
THAT
WARRANTED
CONCERN
BUT
IN
LIGHT
OF
YOUR
STATEMENT
THAT
YOU
ARE
A
STAUNCH
SUPPORTER
OF
GUN
CONTROL
MEASURES
I
THINK
THE
CONCLUSION
WAS
A
REASONABLE
ONE
THE
FACT
REMAINS
THAT
TRAGIC
THOUGH
INDIVIDUAL
ACCIDENTAL
GUN
DEATHS
MAY
BE
THEY
ARE
NOT
A
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
STATISTICALLY
SPEAKING
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
WHY
YOU
THINK
SYMBOLIC
OFFERINGS
DO
GOOD
MY
POINT
WAS
GUN
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WHICH
ARE
ALMOST
ALWAYS
RUN
BY
POLICE
DEPARTMENTS
MIGHT
I
STRESS
MIGHT
DO
A
LITTLE
I
STRESS
LITTLE
GOOD
BY
GIVING
PEOPLE
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
POLICE
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
RESPOND
TO
INTERPERSONAL
GUN
VIOLENCE
IN
A
UNIQUE
WAY
OVERALL
I
THOUGHT
THAT
I
HAD
MADE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
I
DID
NOT
THINK
THAT
GUN
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WERE
USEFUL
SORRY
IF
IT
WASNT
CLEAR
TO
ME
I
THOUGHT
YOU
WERE
WAFFLING
ON
YOUR
VIEW
OF
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WITH
THE
TALK
OF
SYMBOLIC
OFFERINGS
AND
HOPEFULLY
PREVENTING
ACCIDENTS
AND
HEATOFPASSION
SHOOTINGS
I
HAVE
TO
DISAGREE
ON
ALL
THESE
COUNTS
I
CANT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
A
BUYING
GUNS
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
ARENT
INTENDING
TO
MISUSE
THEM
OBVIOUSLY
THOSE
WHO
WANT
TO
USE
GUNS
TO
COMMIT
CRIMES
ARENT
GOING
TO
TURN
THEM
IN
COULD
BE
CONSTRUED
AS
A
POSITIVE
WAY
FOR
POLICE
TO
RESPOND
TO
INTERPERSONAL
VIOLENCE
I
SUGGEST
YOU
GO
BACK
AND
LOOK
AT
WHEREVER
YOU
SAW
THESE
STATISTICS
I
SUSPECT
YOULL
FIND
IF
YOU
LOOK
CAREFULLY
THAT
IS
THE
NUMBER
OF
STUDENTS
ESTIMATED
TO
HAVE
CARRIED
A
WEAPON
NOT
NECESSARILY
A
GUN
TO
SCHOOL
AT
LEAST
ONCE
IN
THE
PAST
YEAR
AND
NOT
THE
NUMBER
OF
STUDENTS
WHO
CARRY
A
GUN
TO
SCHOOL
DAILY
WELL
JOE
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
TALK
TO
THE
CENTER
TO
PREVENT
HANDGUN
VIOLENCE
WHAT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
PUBLISH
FIGURES
SAYING
THAT
AS
MANY
CHILDREN
COMMIT
SUICIDE
BY
HANDGUNS
ALONE
EACH
YEAR
AS
THE
FBI
SAYS
COMMIT
SUICIDE
BY
ALL
METHODS
PER
YEAR
WHO
DO
YOU
THINK
I
SHOULD
BELIEVE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CALL
EVERYONE
UP
TO
AGE
CHILDREN
WHEN
THEYRE
SCREAMING
ABOUT
THE
CARNAGE
OF
OUR
NATIONS
CHILDREN
BEING
CAUSED
BY
HANDGUNS
OR
THE
CENTERS
FOR
DISEASE
CONTROL
AH
YES
THE
AGENCY
THAT
CONSIDERS
ACCIDENTAL
SHOOTINGS
OF
CHILDREN
TO
BE
SUCH
A
STATISTICAL
PROBLEM
THAT
A
STATED
OBJECTIVE
IN
THE
HEALTHY
PEOPLE
DOCUMENT
IS
TO
ENACT
LAWS
IN
STATES
REQUIRING
MANUFACTURERS
OF
HANDGUNS
TO
MAKE
THE
HANDGUNS
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
FIRE
MINIMIZING
THE
LIKELIHOOD
OF
ACCIDENTAL
OR
INTENTIONAL
DSCHARGE
BY
CHILDREN
THE
AGENCY
THAT
FUNDED
THE
STUDY
OF
DC
WHICH
PRONOUNCED
THAT
THE
DC
GUN
BAN
HAD
SAVED
X
LIVES
YES
THEY
ACTUALLY
GAVE
US
A
NUMBER
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
A
LOOK
AT
THE
NUMBER
OF
SHOOTINGS
RATHER
THAN
THE
RATE
OF
SHOOTINGS
IT
WASNT
THEIR
FAULT
THAT
THE
POPULATION
OF
DC
DROPPED
IN
THEIR
POST
LAW
PERIOD
IF
YOU
LOOK
CAREFULLY
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
YOU
GREATLY
UNDERESTIMATE
THE
PRESENCE
OF
GUNS
IN
THE
LIVES
OF
YOUTHS
THE
CPHV
REPORTS
THAT
YOUTH
BRING
GUNS
TO
SCHOOL
DAILY
AND
THAT
BRING
GUNS
TO
SCHOOL
AT
LEAST
ONCE
A
YEAR
THE
CDC
ESTIMATES
THAT
OUT
HIGH
SCHOOL
STUDENTS
CARRIED
A
GUN
TO
SCHOOL
AT
LEAST
ONCE
IN
OKAY
ILL
CONCEDE
I
NO
LONGER
HAVE
THE
NUMBERS
I
ONCE
READ
ON
THESE
ILL
RETRACT
MY
DISPUTE
OF
YOUR
NUMBERS
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
INTERESTED
IN
SEEING
HOW
CPHV
AND
CDC
CAME
UP
WITH
THESE
NUMBERS
THE
CDC
ALSO
SAYS
THAT
MILLION
ELEMENTARYAGED
LATCHKEY
CHILDREN
KIDS
WHO
COME
HOME
FROM
SCHOOL
TO
AN
EMPTY
HOUSE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
GUNS
IN
THEIR
HOME
WHATS
THIS
GOT
TO
DO
WITH
ANYTHING
HELL
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL
I
CAME
HOME
TO
AN
EMPTY
HOUSE
WITH
GUNS
IN
IT
WHY
IS
THIS
A
PROBLEM
I
DIDNT
TOUCH
THE
GUNS
I
HAD
BEEN
TAUGHT
NOT
TO
I
HAD
ALSO
BEEN
TAUGHT
NOT
TO
MESS
WITH
THE
GASOLINE
IN
THE
GARAGE
THE
FUSE
BOX
THE
CAR
THE
KNIVES
THE
OVEN
AND
THE
TOOLS
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
THE
GUNS
ITS
THE
PARENTS
CALIFORNIA
SCHOOLS
REPORTED
A
INCREASE
IN
STUDENT
GUN
CONFISCATIONS
BETWEEN
AND
AND
A
INCREASE
BETWEEN
AND
FLORIDA
REPORTED
A
PERCENT
INCREASE
IN
GUN
INCIDENTS
IN
SCHOOLS
BETWEEN
AMD
THESE
ARE
THE
STATISTICS
AND
WHAT
ARE
THESE
STATES
DOING
WITH
THE
KIDS
THEY
FIND
WITH
GUNS
NOTHING
NO
CRIMINAL
PROSECUTION
NO
EXPULSION
IN
MOST
CASES
NOT
EVEN
SUSPENSION
THEY
TAKE
THE
GUN
SLAP
THE
KIDS
ON
THE
WRIST
SAY
AINT
IT
AWFUL
AND
GO
ON
AS
IF
EVERYTHINGS
BACK
TO
NORMAL
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
THIS
PICTURE
OKAY
MAYBE
I
WORDED
IT
WRONGDAD
I
MEANT
THAT
TO
PUT
CHILDREN
IN
A
SITUATION
FORTIFIED
COMPOUND
WHERE
HARM
COULD
COME
TO
THEM
IS
NOT
THE
ACT
OF
A
MESSIAH
IN
MY
OPINION
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
KORESH
HAD
CONTROL
OVER
THESE
CHILDREN
DIRECTLY
BUT
I
WOULD
HOPE
THAT
WHATEVER
MESSIAH
THERE
IS
WOULD
NOT
LET
INNOCENT
CHILDREN
DIE
I
DONT
THINK
KORESH
WAS
THE
MESSIAH
EITHER
BUT
ISNT
IT
OBVIOUS
THAT
IF
HE
BELIEVED
THE
FORCES
OF
EVIL
WERE
COME
TO
DESTROY
HIM
THEN
HE
BELIEVED
THE
CHILDREN
WERE
MUCH
SAFER
INSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
I
DIDNT
SAY
HE
WAS
SANE
JUST
THAT
HE
BEHAVED
IN
A
PRETTY
RATIONAL
MANNER
GIVEN
WHAT
HE
THOUGHT
WAS
GOING
ON
HE
THOUGHT
HE
HAD
THEM
IN
THE
ONE
PLACE
WHERE
HARM
WOULDNT
COME
TO
THEM
IF
AS
HE
CLAIMED
HE
WAS
THE
MESSIAH
AND
PEOPLE
FOLLOWED
HIM
AS
SUCH
WHY
DID
HE
NOT
TELL
THEIR
PARENTS
TO
FREE
THE
CHILDREN
INSTEAD
OF
LETTING
THEM
BURN
ALIVE
LETS
SEE
YOU
TRY
TO
FIND
THE
EXITS
UNBARRICADE
THEM
AND
FLEE
A
FIRE
WHEN
YOUVE
BEEN
KEPT
AWAKE
FOR
MOST
OF
DAYS
BY
LOUDSPEAKERS
AND
SUBJECTED
TO
SIX
HOURS
OF
TANKS
KNOCKING
IN
YOUR
WALLS
AND
TEAR
GAS
ASSAULT
