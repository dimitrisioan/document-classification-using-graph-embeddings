if

using

run
the

now
youre
logged
in
to
the
archive
machine
there
are
many
directories
on
this
machine
but
the
two
you
are
concerned
with
are
and
there
are
subdirectories
to
the
rkba
directory
those
are
discussed
below
when
you
login
to
the
system
your
directory
is
to
retreive
files
change
your
current
directory
to
the
rkba
directory
with
the
command
cd
or
cd
pubfirearmspoliticsrkba
to
submit
files
change
your
directory
to
the

with
the
command
cd
or
cd

once
you
do
this
youll
get
another
ftp
prompt
asking
you
to

another

to
find
the

the

the

date

the

in

and
some
permission
fields
which
you
do
not
need
to
be
concerned
with
to
get
a
file
run
the
command
get
followed
by
the
name
of
the
file
you
want
for
example
get
index
or
get
noduty
after
the
file
is
transfered
to
your
machine
a
message
like
this
transfer
complete
bytes
received
in
seconds
kbytess
you
can
repeat
the
get
command
for
every
file
you
want
to
retreive
you
can
use
the
mget
command
to
retreive
multiple
files
if
the
file
you
want
is
in
a
subdirectory
for
example
you
should
change
your
directory
to
the
appropriate
subdirectory
first
and
then
retrieve
it
cd
get
once
youre
finished
you
can
log
off
with
the
command
quit
if
you
have
a
file
you
want
to
contribute
the
procedure
is
a
little
different
first
of
all
you
should
find
out
if
the
file
already
exists
so
get
a
copy
of
the
index
file
with
the
procedure
above
and
look
it
over
to
make
sure
you
wouldnt
repeat
an
entry
the
index
will
have
a
description
of
each
of
the
files
in
the
rkba
directory

tonso
from

reason

once
youve
determined
you
wont
be
duplicating
an

login
and
change
to
the

command
see
above
once
you
are
in
the
incoming

use
the
command
put
filename
in
this
case
put
whitemanslaw
again
therell
be
a
transfer
complete
so
many
bytes
transfered
in
so
many
seconds
message
now
your
file
is
on
the
archive
machine
another
thing
to
watch
out
for
is
duplicate
file
names
be
sure
there
isnt
a
file
in
the
incoming
directory
that
is
called
the
same
as
the
file
you
want
to
write
if
you
use
the
same
name
youll
overwrite
the
previous
file
or
youll
get
an
error
message
your
file
may
have
to
be
renamed
if
there
is
a
conflict
with
a
file
by
the
same
name
in
the
rkba
directory
once
your
file
is
in
the
incoming
directory
send
me
an
entry
for
the
index
file
and
i
will
add
it
to
the
file
if
you
cannot
use
anonymous
ftp
and
would
still
like
to
contribute
a
file
email
the
file
to
me
and
ill
take
care
of
the
rest
if
you
submit
a
file
and
do
not
notify
me
it
may
be
removed
so
be
sure
to
let
me
