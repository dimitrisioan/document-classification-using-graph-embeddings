update
day
friday
april
was
the
fourth
day
of
the
trial
synopsis
defense
attorney
gerry
spence
crossexamined
agent
cooper
under
repeated
objections
from
prosecutor
ronald
howen
spence
moved
for
a
mistrial
but
was
denied
the
day
was
marked
by
a
caustic
crossexamination
of
deputy
marshal
larry
cooper
by
defense
attorney
gerry
spence
although
spence
has
not
explicitly
stated
so
one
angle
of
his
stategy
must
involve
destroying
the
credibility
of
agent
cooper
cooper
is
the
governments
only
eyewitness
to
the
death
of
agent
degan
spence
attacked
coopers
credibility
by
pointing
out
discrepancies
between
coopers
statements
last
september
and
those
made
in
court
cooper
conceded
that
you
have
all
these
things
compressed
into
a
few
secondsits
difficult
to
remember
what
went
on
first
cooper
acknowledged
that
he
carried
a
colt
commando
submachine
gun
with
a
silenced
barrel
i
thought
a
colt
commando
was
a
revolver
cooper
continued
by
stating
that
the
federal
agents
had
no
specific
plans
to
use
the
weapon
when
they
started
to
kill
weavers
dog
when
spence
asked
how
seven
cartridges
could
be
fired
by
degans
rifle
when
degan
was
apparently
dead
cooper
could
not
say
for
sure
that
degan
did
not
return
fire
before
going
down
spence
continued
by
asking
with
how
many
agents
and
to
what
extent
had
cooper
discussed
last
augusts
events
cooper
responded
if
youre
implying
that
we
got
our
story
together
youre
wrong
counselor
spence
continued
to
advance
the
defenses
version
of
the
events
namely
that
a
marshal
had
started
the
shooting
by
killing
the
weavers
dog
cooper
disagreed
assistant
us
attorney
ronald
howen
repeatedly
objected
to
spences
virulent
crossexamination
of
agent
cooper
arguing
that
the
questions
were
repetitive
and
spence
was
wasting
time
howen
also
complained
that
spence
was
improperly
using
a
crossexamination
to
advance
the
defenses
version
of
the
events
us
district
judge
edward
lodge
sustained
many
of
the
objections
however
both
lawyers
persisted
until
judge
lodge
had
the
jury
leave
the
room
and
proceded
to
admonish
both
attorneys
im
not
going
to
play
games
with
either
counsel
this
has
been
a
personality
problem
from
day
so
start
acting
like
professionals
spence
told
the
judge
that
when
all
the
evidence
is
in
well
see
that
his
agent
larry
cooper
testimony
is
not
credible
that
he
was
panicked
and
cannot
remember
the
sequence
of
events
spence
continued
were
going
to
findthat
there
is
a
very
unlikely
similarity
almost
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
a
cookie
cutter
between
the
testimony
of
mr
cooper
and
the
other
witnesses
spence
then
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
the
grounds
that
howens
repeated
objections
would
prevent
a
fair
trial
we
cant
have
a
fair
trial
if
the
jury
believes
im
some
sort
of
charlatan
if
the
jury
believes
im
bending
the
rules
or
engaging
in
some
delaying
tactic
or
that
im
violating
court
orders
judge
lodge
called
the
notion
that
his
repeated
sustainings
of
howens
objections
had
somehow
prejudiced
the
jury
was
preposterous
and
denied
the
motion
for
a
mistrial
lodge
did
tell
howen
to
restrict
his
comments
when
objecting
the
trial
resumed
with
the
prosecution
calling
fbi
special
agent
greg
rampton
the
prosecutions
purpose
was
simply
to
introduce
five
weapons
found
in
the
cabin
as
evidence
however
the
defense
seized
on
the
opportunity
to
further
address
coopers
credibility
defense
attorney
ellison
matthews
harris
other
attorney
questioned
rampton
about
the
dog
rampton
stated
that
there
were
no
specific
plans
to
kill
the
weavers
dog
without
being
detected
matthews
then
had
rampton
read
a
septtember
transcript
in
which
rampton
had
said
that
cooper
had
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
silenced
weapon
was
to
kill
the
dog
without
being
detected
if
the
dog
chased
them
rampton
then
acknowledged
that
he
believed
that
cooper
had
said
that
but
he
could
not
remember
when
he
then
stated
that
i
did
not
conduct
the
primary
interview
with
deputy
cooper
but
i
have
had
conversations
with
him
since
the
interview
was
conducted
monday
april
will
begin
the
fifth
day
of
the
trial
scheduled
is
the
continued
crossexamination
of
fbi
agent
greg
rampton
