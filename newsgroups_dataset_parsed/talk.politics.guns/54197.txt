CONCEDED
THAT
YOU
HAVE
ALL
THESE
THINGS
COMPRESSED
INTO
A
FEW
SECONDSITS
DIFFICULT
TO
REMEMBER
WHAT
WENT
ON
FIRST
COOPER
ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT
HE
CARRIED
A
COLT
COMMANDO
SUBMACHINE
GUN
WITH
A
SILENCED
BARREL
I
THOUGHT
A
COLT
COMMANDO
WAS
A
REVOLVER
COOPER
CONTINUED
BY
STATING
THAT
THE
FEDERAL
AGENTS
HAD
NO
SPECIFIC
PLANS
TO
USE
THE
WEAPON
WHEN
THEY
STARTED
TO
KILL
WEAVERS

BE
FIRED
BY
DEGANS
RIFLE

WAS
APPARENTLY
DEAD
COOPER
COULD
NOT
SAY
FOR

BY
ASKING
WITH
HOW
MANY

COOPER
RESPONDED
IF
YOURE

OUR

TOGETHER
YOURE
WRONG
COUNSELOR
SPENCE
CONTINUED
TO
ADVANCE
THE

VERSION
OF

NAMELY
THAT
A

HAD
STARTED
THE

THE
WEAVERS
DOG
COOPER
DISAGREED
ASSISTANT
US
ATTORNEY
RONALD
HOWEN
REPEATEDLY
OBJECTED
TO
SPENCES
VIRULENT
CROSSEXAMINATION
OF

ARGUING
THAT
THE
QUESTIONS
WERE
REPETITIVE
AND
SPENCE
WAS
WASTING
TIME
HOWEN
ALSO
COMPLAINED
THAT
SPENCE
WAS
IMPROPERLY
USING
A
CROSSEXAMINATION
TO
ADVANCE
THE
DEFENSES
VERSION
OF
THE
EVENTS
US
DISTRICT
JUDGE
EDWARD
LODGE
SUSTAINED
MANY
OF
THE
OBJECTIONS
HOWEVER
BOTH
LAWYERS
PERSISTED
UNTIL
JUDGE
LODGE
HAD
THE
JURY
LEAVE
THE
ROOM
AND
PROCEDED
TO
ADMONISH
BOTH
ATTORNEYS
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
PLAY
GAMES
WITH
EITHER
COUNSEL
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
PERSONALITY
PROBLEM
FROM
DAY
SO
START
ACTING
LIKE
PROFESSIONALS
SPENCE
TOLD
THE
JUDGE
THAT
WHEN
ALL
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
IN
WELL
SEE
THAT
HIS
AGENT
LARRY
COOPER
TESTIMONY
IS
NOT
CREDIBLE
THAT
HE
WAS
PANICKED
AND
CANNOT
REMEMBER
THE
SEQUENCE
OF
EVENTS
SPENCE
CONTINUED
WERE
GOING
TO
FINDTHAT
THERE
IS
A
VERY
UNLIKELY
SIMILARITY
ALMOST
AS
IF
IT
HAD
COME
OUT
OF
A
COOKIE
CUTTER
BETWEEN
THE
TESTIMONY
OF
MR
COOPER
AND
THE
OTHER
WITNESSES
SPENCE
THEN
MOVED
FOR
A
MISTRIAL
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
HOWENS
REPEATED
OBJECTIONS
WOULD
PREVENT
A
FAIR
TRIAL
WE
CANT
HAVE
A
FAIR
TRIAL
IF
THE
JURY
BELIEVES
IM
SOME
SORT
OF
CHARLATAN
IF
THE
JURY
BELIEVES
IM
BENDING
THE
RULES
OR
ENGAGING
IN
SOME
DELAYING
TACTIC
OR
THAT
IM
VIOLATING
COURT
ORDERS
JUDGE
LODGE
CALLED
THE
NOTION
THAT
HIS
REPEATED
SUSTAININGS
OF
HOWENS
OBJECTIONS
HAD
SOMEHOW
PREJUDICED
THE
JURY
WAS
PREPOSTEROUS
AND
DENIED
THE
MOTION
FOR
A
MISTRIAL
LODGE
DID
TELL
HOWEN
TO
RESTRICT
HIS
COMMENTS
WHEN
OBJECTING
THE
TRIAL
RESUMED
WITH
