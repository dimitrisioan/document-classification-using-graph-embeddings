predict
that
the
outcome
of
the
study
of
what
went
wrong
with
the
federal
assault
in
waco
will
result
in
future
assaults
of
that
type
being
conducted
as
fullscale
military
operations
with
explicit
shoottokill
directives

mean
they
arent
already
could
have
fooled
me
only
because
you
are
apparently
easy
to
fool
in
other
words
your
remark
is
obviously
from
someone
who
wouldnt
know
the
difference
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
