according
to
wnci
fm
radio
this
morning
dayton
ohio
is
operating
a
gun
buy
back
they
are
giving
for
every
functional
gun
turned
in
they
ran
out
of
money
in
one
day
and
are
now
passing
out
vouchers
of
some
sort
they
are
looking
for
more
funds
to
keep
operating
another
mediaevent
brought
to
you
by
hci
is
there
something
similar
progun
people
can
do
for
example
pay
to
anyone
who
lawfully
protects
their
life
with
a
firearm
sounds
a
bit
tacky
but

here
are
a
few
ideas
a
free
library
card
so
they
can
look
up
the
fbi
uniform
crime
report
which
shows
how
good
hci
is
at
lying
through
their
teeth
a
free
rtd
transit
pass
which
will
allow
antigunners
to
tour
south
central
los
angeles
and
convince
people
living
there
that
they
dont
need
guns
to
protect
themselves
because
the
police
will
do
it
for
them
dont
lose
the
pass
youll
need
it
to
get
out
a
free
bus
ride
to
vermont
which
has
almost
no
gun
control
and
curiously
enough
almost
no
crime
either
a
free
calculator
since
antigunners
have
heretofore
been
unable
to
figure
out
what
a
small
percentage
of
the
guns
owned
in
america
are
used
to
commit
violent
crime
