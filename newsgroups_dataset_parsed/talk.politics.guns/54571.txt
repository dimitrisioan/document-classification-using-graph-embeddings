INFRINGED
DOES
NOT
DESCRIBE
MODIFY

LESS
HARSH
ANYTHING
AND
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
GRAMMAR
OR
SOME
SORT
OF
POSITION
OR
TASK
BY
PROCESS
OF
ELIMINATION
IT
MUST
FALL
INTO
DEFINITION
AND
SINCE
DEALS
WITH
LEGAL
POWER
THE
SAME
THING
THE
CONSTITUTION
DOES
IT
MUST
BE
THE
CORRECT
DEFINITION
IN
THIS
CASE
THEREFORE
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
GIVES
LEGAL
POWER
TO
THE
WELL
REGUALATED
MILITIA
AND
THIS

AH
CLARIFICATION
BY
OBFUSCATION
ACTUALLY
THE
WORDS
A
WELL
REGULATED
MILITA
BEING
NECESSARY
TO
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
FREE
STATE
IS
A
PRESENT
PARTICIPLE
USED
AS
AN
ADJECTIVE
TO
MODIFY
MILITIA
WHICH
IS
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
MAIN
CLAUSE
OF
THE
SENTENCE
THE
SUBJECT
BEING
THE
RIGHT
THE
VERB
SHALL
IT
ASSERTS
THAT
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
IS
ESSENTIAL
FOR
MAINTAINING
A
MILITA
THE
SENTENCE
DOESNT
RESTRICT
THE
RIGHT
OR
STATE
OR
IMPLY
POSSESSION
OF
THE
RIGHT
BY
ANYONE
OR
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
THE
PEOPLE
ALL
IT
DOES
IS
MAKE
A
POSITIVE
STATEMENT
REGARDING
A
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THE
PEOPLE
AS
IN
YOU
AND
ME
AS
IN
THE
FIRST
FOURTH
NINTH
TENTH
AS
WELL
AS
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THIS
RIGHT
IS
ASSUMED
IT
IS
NOT
GRANTED
BY
THE
AMENDMENT
THERE
IS
NO
STATED
OR
IMPLIED
CONDITION
RELATING
THE
RIGHT
TO
BEAR
ARMS
TO
THE
NECESSITY
OF
A
WELLREGULATED
MILITIA
TO
THE
SECURITY
OF
A
FREE
STATE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THE
ENTIRE
SENTENCE
SAYS
THAT
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
IS
UNCONDITIONAL
SO
IN
EFFORT
NOT
TO
FORCE
MY
VIEWS
AND
NOT
TO
DESTORY
OUR
LIBERTIES
AND
RIGHTS
I
STATE
THAT
NOTHING
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
OR
WILL
WRITE
IN
THE
MATTER
OF
LIBERTIES
AND
RIGHTS
IS
THE
FINAL
WORD
FOR
I
AM
ONLY
ONE
PERSON
AMONG
MANY
AND
THE
FINAL
WORD
ON
LIBERTIES
AND
RIGHTS
CLEARY
AND
IRREVOCABLY
BELONGS
TO
THE
MANY
THE
FINAL
WORD
ON
LIBERTIES
AND
RIGHTS
SHOULD
NOT
BELONG
TO
THE
MANY
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
HAVE
A
CONSTITUTION
OTHERWISE
A
TYRRANY
OF
THE
MAJORITY
CAN
ENSUE
FROM
POPULAR
OPINION
A
CONCEPT
WHICH
YOU
SHOULD
BE
FAMILIAR
WITH
FROM
THE
FEDERALIST
PAPERS
AL
STANDARD
DISCLAIMER
