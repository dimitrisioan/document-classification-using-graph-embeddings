MARCIANO
PITARGUECISCOCOM
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
AUTOMOBILE
ACCIDENTS
BUT
ATLEAST
THERE
IS
SOME
REGULATION
TO
TRY
TO
COMBAT
THIS
WHEN
I
GOT
MY
DRIVERS
LICENSE
I
HAD
TO
TAKE
A
DRIVERS
SAFETY
CLASS
TENNESSEE
AT
LEAST
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
ANY
SORT
OF
SAFETY
CLASS
TO
GET
A
DRIVERS
LICENSE
ALL
THAT
IS
REQUIRED
IS
ONE
TWENTY
QUESTION
QUIZ
AND
TO
DRIVE
A
CAR
AROUND
THE
BLOCK
WITHOUT
CRASHING
I
HAVE
TO
BE
LICENSED
TO
DRIVE
IN
ALL
PROBABILITY
NO
YOU
DONT
YOU
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
BE
LICENSED
TO
DRIVE
ON
PUBLIC
ROADS
A
LICENSE
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
ON
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
MY
CAR
MUST
BE
REGISTERED
MOST
STATES
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
THE
REGISTRATION
OF
CARS
THAT
ARE
NOT
USED
ON
PUBLIC
ROADS
THOSE
THAT
DO
CALIFORNIA
I
KNOW
OF
DO
SO
FOR
TAX
PURPOSES
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
I
MUST
AT
LEAST
WHERE
I
LIVE
HAVE
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
ON
BOTH
MYSELF
DRIVING
AND
MY
CAR
IF
SOMEONE
ELSE
HAD
AN
ACCIDENT
WITH
IT
MANY
STATES
DO
NOT
CURRENTLY
REQUIRE
THIS
AND
MOST
AGAIN
ONLY
MAKE
THIS
REQUIREMENT
FOR
PUBLIC
ROADS
A
CAR
SITTING
UNUSED
IS
NOT
REQUIRED
TO
HAVE
INSURANCE
HMM
WOULDNT
MANDITORY
SAFTEY
CLASSES
REGISTRATION
OF
BOTH
THE
OWNER
AND
GUN
AND
MANDITORY
LIABILITY
INSURANCE
BE
NICE
FOR
GUN
OWNERS
THE
TWO
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
I
POINTED
OUT
ABOVE
THERE
ARE
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
MAKING
RULES
FOR
USE
ON
PUBLIC
PROPERTY
AND
MAKING
RULES
FOR
OWNERSHIP
THE
OTHER
HALF
OF
THE
OBJECTION
IS
TRUST
SIMILAR
THINGS
TO
THIS
HAVE
BEEN
TRIED
IN
MANY
LOCAL
JURISDICATIONS
ACROSS
THE
COUNTRY
AND
HAVE
BEEN
ABUSED
IN
FAR
TOO
MANY
CASES
SAFETY
CLASSES
WHICH
ARE
NEVER
SHEDULED
NEVER
FUNDED
OR
ONLY
ONE
OR
TWO
IS
HELD
A
YEAR
FOR
A
LIMITED
NUMBER
OF
PARTICIPANTS
REGISTRATION
LISTS
IN
NEW
YORK
CHICAGO
AND
CALIFORNIA
HAVE
BEEN
USED
FOR
CONFISCATION
MANY
GUN
OWNERS
WOULD
IN
THEORY
SUPPORT
THESE
PLANES
ALTHOUGH
THE
NUMBERS
OVERWHELMINGLY
SHOW
THAT
COMPETENCE
IS
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
INTENTIONAL
MISUSE
IS
THEYVE
SIMPLY
SEEN
IT
ABUSED
AND
ARE
LEERY
OF
THE
NEXT
PERSON
WHO
COMES
DOWN
THE
PIKE
WITH
A
REASONABLE
SUGGESTION
THEYVE
ALREADY
SEEN
ABUSED
