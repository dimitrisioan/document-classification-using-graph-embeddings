RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
FROM
STEINERJUPITERCSEUTOLEDOEDU
JASON
THINK
STEINER
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
DAVID
VEAL
SAYS
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
DONT
BE
SILLY
OF
COURSE
YOU
CAN
THE
POLICE
HAVE
EVERYTHING
THE
GANGS
HAVE
AND
THEN
SOME
PLUS
THEYVE
GOT
ACCESS
TO
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
VIA
THE
GOVERNOR
IF
THINGS
GET
TOO
ROUGH
THATS
TANKS
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHOVE
NEVER
SEEN
THEM
AT
PLAY
OF
COURSE
THEYVE
GOT
RIFLES
AND
HELICOPTERS
AND
AS
FAR
AS
FULLYAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
YOU
CAN
BE
A
LOT
BETTER
ARMED
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
HIT
WHAT
YOU
AIM
AT
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
HAPPENING
HERE
IS
THE
SITUATION
GETTING
TOTALLY
BLOWN
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
IN
MY
POST
I
WAS
REFERRING
TO
YOUR
REGULAR
PATROLMAN
IN
A
CAR
CRUISING
AROUND
THE
CITY
VS
GANG
MEMBERS
OF
COURSE
THE
POLICE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
THINGS
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
BUT
DO
THEY
USE
TANKS
AND
SUCH
ALL
OF
THE
TIME
OF
COURSE
THEY
DONT
AND
THATS
THE
POINT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
EVERY
DAY
WHEN
I
GO
OUT
TO
LUNCH
I
ALWAYS
SEE
COPS
COMING
IN
THE
MAJORITY
THAT
I
SEE
ARE
STILL
CARRYING
REVOLVERS
NOT
THAT
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
WRONG
WITH
A
REVOLVER
BUT
IF
YOURE
A
COP
THAT
IS
UP
AGAINST
SOME
GANG
MEMBER
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
AUTOMATICS
IN
HIS
COAT
I
MEAN
SEMIAUTO
HANDGUNS
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
EVEN
WITH
TRAINING
HOW
SO
I
THINK
YOURE
MAKING
ASSUMPTIONS
HERE
THAT
MIGHT
NOT
NECESSARILY
BE
TRUE
MY
PERSONAL
CHOICE
WOULD
BE
A
SEMIAUTO
BUT
REVOLVERS
ARE
JUST
AS
EFFECTIVE
IF
NOT
MORE
SO
I
HAVE
BEEN
AT
A
SHOOTING
RANGE
WHERE
GANG
GANG
MEMBERS
WERE
PRACTICING
SHOOTING
THEY
WERE
ACTUALLY
PRACTICING
TAKING
OUT
THEIR
GUNS
AS
QUICK
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
SHOOTING
AT
THE
TARGET
AND
THEY
WERENT
DOING
TOO
BADLY
EITHER
RELEVANCY
PLEASE
YOU
SOUND
SHOCKED
BUT
THAT
HARDLY
PROVES
ANYTHING
THE
UNIVERSITY
COPS
HERE
WHO
ARE
ARE
STATE
COPS
ARE
ARMED
BETTER
THAN
THE
CHICAGO
POLICE
IT
SEEMS
MOST
STATE
COPS
ARE
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
YOU
ARE
ORIGINALLY
FROM
DAVID
BUT
YOU
LIVE
IN
TENNESSE
AND
I
LIVE
IN
CHICAGO
AND
SEE
THIS
CRAP
EVERYDAY
ON
THE
NEWS
AND
IN
THE
PAPERS
I
THINK
THE
SITUATION
IS
JUST
A
TAD
DIFFERENT
HERE
THAN
THERE
WAIT
DOESNT
CHICAGO
HAVE
SERIOUS
GUN
CONTROL
IF
SO
WHY
DO
THE
POLICE
NEED
ALL
THAT
FIREPOWER
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
SARCASM
ALERT
ALL
THE
PATROL
CARS
IVE
SEEN
AROUND
HERE
HAVE
SHOTGUNS
CLAMPED
TO
THE
DASH
BOARD
IMHO
THATS
ALL
THE
POLICE
NEED
TO
OUTGUN
JUST
ABOUT
ANYTHING
JASON
THE
CRYSTAL
WIND
IS
THE
STORM
AND
THE
STORM
IS
DATA
AND
THE
DATA
IS
LIFE
THE
PLAYERS
LITANY

THE
LONG
RUN
