the
koreshians
rubbed
themselves
out
neither
mormons
nor
jews
have
a
propensity
for
dousing
themselves
with
kerosene
so
im
not
particularly
concerned
or
shall
we
blame
jim
jones
on
the
government
also
the
suggestion
that
they
davidians
committed
suicide
is
completely
without
evidence
except
for
the
editorials
please
reword
propensity
for
allegedly
dousing
themselves
oh
and
the
survivors
claim
the
the
fbi
started
the
burning
by
accidentally
igniting
kerosene
lanterns
remember
that
theyd
already
cut
the
power
and
the
propane
tanks
this
sounds
a
lot
more
likely
than
committing
suicide
by
setting
the
place
