FUELING
THE

A

WITHOUT

WHAT
CONTINUES

ARE
TH
EACTIONS
OF

WHO
BUNGLED
THE

FROM

NO

THE

HAS
PROVIDED
A

COMPELLING
REASON
FOR
ABANDONDONING
THE
COURSE
OF
PATIENCE
IF
INTELLIGENCE
WAS
ACCURATE
AND
KORESH
WAS
GROWING
INCREASINGLY
VIOLENT
AND
BIZARRE
IT
IS
DIFFI
CULT
TO
SEE
HOW
A

LAUNCHED
BY
AN
COMBAT

WOULD
CLEAR
HIS
MIND
IF
