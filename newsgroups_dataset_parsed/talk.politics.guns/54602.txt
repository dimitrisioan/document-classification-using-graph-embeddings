re
fbi
directors
statement
on
waco
standoff
the
branch
davidians
were
not
violent
and
were
not
planning
to
start
violence
when
the
bd
compound
was
assaulted
by
the
atf
the
bd
did
fire
back
but
they
agreed
to
a
cease
fire
and
they
allowed
the
atf
to
care
for
their
wounded
the
bd
even
released
the
atf
agents
they
captured
it
is
clear
from
the
release
of
the
agents
and
allowing
the
atf
medical
attention
that
the
bd
were
not
looking
for
trouble
if
the
bd
were
violent
they
would
have
held
the
atf
agents
as
hostages
they
would
not
have
released
them
like
they
did
if
they
had
kept
the
agents
hostage
they
could
have
used
them
as
bargening
chips
for
medical
attention
etc
a
big
thing
is
being
made
of
the
bd
collection
of
weapons
but
no
one
has
shown
that
they
had
any
plans
to
use
them
it
is
also
apparent
that
the
bd
did
not
have
any
military
training
if
they
had
they
could
have
dug
bunkers
and
trenches
and
increased
their
fortifications
they
could
have
shot
out
the
lights
and
speakers
it
appears
that
the
bd
were
not
violent
they
shot
back
at
the
attacking
atf
agents
out
of
panic
there
were
shots
fired
on
the
last
day
but
they
were
in
response
to
the
fbi
attack
on
the
compound
with
armor
all
the
violence
in
waco
was
initiated
by
the
federal
agents
not
the
bd
rod
anderson
the
only
acceptable
substitute
boulder
co
for
brains
is
silence
