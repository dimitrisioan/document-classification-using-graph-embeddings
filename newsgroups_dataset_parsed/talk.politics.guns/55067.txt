DELETED
WHAT
EXACTLY
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
SAY
AND
WHY
WERE
THERE
NO
FIREENGINES
WITHIN
A
MILE
OF
THE
COMPOUND
BECAUSE
THE
GUN
LOONIES
WERE
FIRING
ON
VEHICLES
WITH
AMUNITION
THAT
HAS
A
RANGE
OF
METERS
THEY
WERE
USING
CALIBER
AMMUNITION
NOT
AMMO
WOULD
BE
A
SHELL
OF
THIS
SIZE
WOULD
BE
LARGER
THAN
A
LOT
OF
CANNON
SHELLS
SNIPERS
COULD
HAVE
SCREENED
THE
PEOPLE
TRYING
TO
PUT
OUT
THE
FIRE
BESIDES
THE
RANCH
HOUSE
NOT
FORT
APOCALYPSE
IT
WAS
JUST
A
HOUSE
DESPITE
WHAT
THE
FBI
AND
ATF
SAYS
WAS
ON
FIRE
THE
GUN
LOONIES
COULDNT
HARDLY
HAVE
BEEN
SHOOTING
AT
FIRE
MEN
WHILE
THERE
HOUSE
WAS
ENGULFED
IN
FLAMES
THE
FBI
AND
ATF
DONT
HAVE
ANY
EXCUSE
FOR
NOT
HAVING
FIRE
ENGINES
THERE
TO
PUT
OUT
THE
BLAZE
THE
BASTARDS
WAITED
UNTIL
THE
FIRE
WAS
WELL
UNDER
WAY
BEFORE
THEY
CALLED
THE
FIRE
DEPARTMENT
IN
WACO
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
TELL
THE
FIRE
DEPARTMENT
TO
BE
ON
STANDBY
I
SINCERELY
HOPE
THAT
THE
FBI
ATF
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
JANET
RENO
AND
ALL
OTHERS
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
FIASCO
GET
THE
JUST
PUNISHMENT
THAT
THEY
SO
RICHLY
DESERVE
SOMEONE
SHOULD
PAY
FOR
THIS
NEEDLESS
TRAGIC
WASTE
OF
HUMAN
LIFE
SADLY
THESE
EVIL
SOBS
WILL
PROBABLY
NEVER
FACE
JUSTICE
THE
MEDIA
AND
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
JUST
WHITEWASH
THIS
INCIDENT
AND
CHALK
IT
UP
AS
BEING
SOLELY
DAVID
KORESHS
FAULT
SADDER
STILL
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
WILL
PROBABLY
BELIEVE
THEM
NEXT
QUESTION
THE
PROBLEM
IS
OF
COURSE
THE
LAWS
THAT
ALLOW
A
BUNCH
OF
RAVING
NUTTERS
TO
COLLECT
A
HUGE
STACK
OF
ARMS
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
PROBLEMTHE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
GOVERNMENT
THAT
IS
BECOMING
MORE
TYRANNICAL
EVERY
DAY
IF
PEOPLE
DECIDE
TO
OWN
GUNS
AND
LIVE
IN
ONE
PLACE
TOGETHER
THEN
THAT
IS
THEIR
PREROGATIVE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
THE
BDS
WERE
IN
POSESSION
OF
EXPLOSIVES
AND
ILLEGAL
GUNS
THEN
THE
GOVERNMENT
DID
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
SEARCH
THEIR
COMPOUND
BUT
THE
ALLEGATIONS
THAT
THE
BDS
WERE
IN
POSESSION
OF
ILLEGAL
WEAPONS
HASNT
BEEN
PROVEN
YET
SO
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
BDS
BROKE
ANY
LAWS
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
ACCUSED
OF
ABUSING
CHILDREN
BUT
IF
THIS
IS
HIS
ONLY
CRIME
THEN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
ATF
CANT
BE
JUSTIFIED
THE
ATF
IS
ONLY
SUPPOSED
TO
DEAL
WITH
FIREARMS
TOBACCO
AND
ALCOHOL
VIOLATIONS
ATF
AGENTS
ARE
BASICALLY
CIGARETTE
COPSTHEY
SHOULD
STAY
OUT
OF
OTHER
KINDS
OF
LAWENFORCEMENT
ACTIONS
THAT
ARE
OUT
OF
THEIR
JURISDICTION
BETTER
YET
THEY
SHOULD
BE
STCANNED
IMO
THE
SEQUENCE
OF
EVENTS
MEANT
THAT
THERE
REALLY
WAS
NO
OPTION
BUT
TO
ATTEMPT
SOME
SORT
OF
BREAKTHROUGH
VIA
AN
INTERVENTION
IF
THE
FBI
HAD
HAD
THE
STOMACH
FOR
IT
THEY
COULD
HAVE
MOUNTED
A
COMMANDO
TYPE
RAID
AND
ATTEMPTED
TO
SAVE
THE
CHILDREN
BY
SHOOTING
ALL
THE
ADULTS
SOUNDS
LIKE
SOMETHING
THE
SS
WOULD
DO
HUMAN
LIFECHILDREN
AND
ADULTS
ALIKESHOULD
BE
TREATED
WITH
RESPECTEVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
HEAVILYARMED
RELIGIOUS
WACKOS
DAVID
KORESHS
LAWYER
SEEMED
TO
THINK
THAT
EVERYONE
WOULD
COME
OUT
PEACEFULLY
SOONER
OR
LATER
THE
FBI
AND
ATF
HAD
NOTHING
BUT
TIME
ON
THEIR
HANDS
WHY
DID
THEY
HAVE
TO
ESCALATE
THE
SITUATION
AND
CAUSE
THIS
SENSELESS
TRAGEDY
THEIR
JOB
IS
TO
PROTECT
THE
PUBLIC
AND
SAVE
LIVES
NOT
KILL
PEOPLE
FOR
CRYING
OUT
LOUD
IT
REALLY
WAS
A
NO
WIN
SITUATION
KORESH
HAD
PLENTY
OF
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GIVE
UP
AND
STAND
TRIAL
FOR
THE
MURDER
OF
THE
ATF
OFFICERS
INSTEAD
HE
ORDERED
THE
MURDER
OF
THE
CHILDREN
DONT
BE
SO
SURE
ABOUT
THAT
I
READ
IN
A
NEWSPAPER
TODAY
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
CULT
MEMBERS
SAID
THAT
WHEN
ONE
OF
THE
TANKS
WENT
THROUGH
THE
WALL
THAT
IT
KNOCKED
OVER
A
LANTERN
WHICH
CAUSED
THE
RANCH
HOUSE
TO
BE
CAUGHT
ON
FIRE
THIS
CULT
MEMBER
ALSO
SAID
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
HAD
NO
INTENTIONS
OF
COMMITTING
MASS
SUICIDE
DAVID
KORESHS
LAWYER
ALSO
CONFIRMS
THIS
THEREFORE
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
THEN
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
FBI
AND
ATF
MURDERED
EVERYONE
IN
THAT
HOUSE
EVEN
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
THE
FBI
AND
ATF
STILL
DONT
GET
OFF
THE
HOOK
BECAUSE
THEY
WAITED
A
DAMN
LONG
TIME
TO
CALL
THE
WACO
FIRE
DEPARTMENT
PERHAPS
THEY
WANTED
ALL
THESE
PEOPLE
TO
DIE
IN
ORDER
TO
REJECT
THE
WORD
OF
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
IT
IS
NECCESSARY
TO
BELEIVE
THE
WORDS
OF
A
MAN
WHO
HAS
JUST
MURDERED
CHILDREN
AND
ORDERED
THE
SUICIDEMURDER
OF
HIS
OTHER
FOLLOWERS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
ACCOUNT
GIVEN
THE
BATF
ATTEMPTED
TO
SERVE
A
WARRANT
UPON
KORESH
AT
THE
RANCH
AND
WERE
MET
BY
GUNFIRE
IN
A
DELIBERATE
ATTEMPT
TO
MURDER
THEM
THE
KORESHGUN
SUPPORTER
CLAIM
THAT
THE
BATF
STARTED
SHOOTING
SIMPLY
DOES
NOT
STAND
UP
IF
THE
AFT
HAD
GONE
THERE
TO
START
SHOOTING
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
WITH
HEAVIER
GRADE
WEAPONRY
THAN
STANDARD
ISSUE
HANDGUNS
FOR
ALL
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
THEY
WERE
UNARMED
THE
BD
FOLLOWERS
HAD
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
YOURE
WRONG
ON
SEVERAL
ACCOUNTS
ATF
AGENTS
WERE
ADEQUATELY
ARMED
THEY
HAD
AND
SHOTGUNS
SOME
AGENTS
WERE
ARMED
WITH
AUTOMATIC
PISTOLS
BUT
NOT
ALL
WERE
THE
ATFS
INITIAL
CLAIMWHICH
THEY
LATER
RETRACTEDTHAT
AGENTS
WERE
UNDERARMED
IS
SIMPLY
LUDICROUS
THE
BD
SEIGE
COULD
NOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
GO
ON
INDEFINITELY
THE
BD
WERE
QUITE
CAPABLE
OF
COMMITING
MASS
SUICIDE
AND
MURDERING
THE
CHILDREN
AT
ANY
TIME
A
COMMANDO
ASSAULT
WAS
THE
ONLY
OTHER
LIKELY
ACTION
THAT
COULD
HAVE
ACHIEVED
THAT
OBJECTIVE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
RISKY
ORDERS
OF
MAGINTUDE
HARDER
THAN
ANTEBBE
OR
THE
IRANIAN
EMBASSY
SEIGE
AIRPLANES
AND
EMBASSIES
ARE
NOT
DESIGNED
FOR
DEFENSE
AGAINST
ATTACK
RANCH
APOCALYPSE
WAS
TERRORISTS
ARE
FAR
EASIER
TO
DISLOGE
WITHOUT
CASUALTIES
THAN
ALLOWING
THE
SIEGE
TO
GO
ON
WAS
NOT
AN
OPTION
EITHER
BESIDES
THE
SERIOUS
RISK
THAT
KORESH
WOULD
PROCLAIM
ARMAGEDDON
AT
ANY
MOMENT
THERE
WAS
THE
QUESTION
OF
THE
DIFFICULTIES
OF
KEEPING
THE
EMMERGENCY
TEAM
ON
STANDBY
OVER
A
PROLONGED
PERIOD
THE
LONGER
THE
SIEGE
WENT
ON
THE
MORE
MENTALLY
PREPARED
KORESH
AND
HIS
FOLLOWERS
WOULD
BE
FOR
A
PROLONGED
SIEGE
RATHER
THAN
GO
IN
PREMATURELY
THE
MISTAKE
WAS
PROBABLY
TO
GO
IN
TOO
SOON
CAN
YOU
THINK
OF
A
BETTER
WAY
OF
GETTING
THE
CHILDREN
OUT
A
CERTAIN
WAY
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
WANT
GUN
CONTROL
MUST
OBVIOUSLY
DISCOUNT
THE
ENTIRE
GOVERNMENT
STORY
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
RATIONALISATION
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
TO
SIMPLY
DISMISS
THE
GOVERNMENT
AS
INCOMPETENT
THAT
WOULD
REQUIRE
THEM
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
SOLUTION
THEMSELVES
INSTEAD
THEY
HAVE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
GOVERNMENT
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
WHEREBY
THE
GOVERNMENT
DECIDED
TO
SET
OUT
TO
MURDER
PEOPLE
JUST
TO
SET
UP
SOME
SORT
OF
SCARE
TO
ALOW
THEM
TO
GET
GUN
CONTROL
LEGISLATION
THROUGH
GUN
CONTROL
ISNT
THE
ONLY
ISSUE
HERE
IF
THE
SICK
LITTLE
MONKEYS
IN
WASHINGTON
TRY
TO
USE
THE
WACO
INCIDENT
AS
A
REASON
TO
BAN
GUNS
THEN
THEY
WILL
HAVE
DEMONSTRATED
JUST
HOW
FED
UP
THEY
ARE
WHAT
CONCERNS
ME
MUCH
MORE
THAN
NEW
GUN
CONTROL
LEGISLATION
IS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
SEEMS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
ST
LIKE
THEY
DID
IN
WACOTHEY
ARE
BECOMING
MORE
AND
MORE
CALLOUS
ABOUT
PEOPLES
RIGHTS
AND
THE
LAW
THIS
GREATLY
DISTURBS
ME
AND
IT
SHOULD
DISTURB
YOU
AS
WELL
THIS
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
BATF
DELIBERATELY
GOT
OF
ITS
AGENTS
KILLED
AND
THAT
THE
FBI
ETC
ACTUALLY
ENJOY
SITTING
OUT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
TEXAS
BEING
SHOT
AT
BY
RELIGIOUS
NUTTERS
STILL
THE
CONSPIRACY
THEORY
IS
COMFORTING
IT
ALLOWS
THEM
TO
PRETEND
THAT
WACO
PROVES
NOTHING
EXCEPT
ABOUT
HOW
INCOMPETENT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
IN
RESOLVING
A
HOSTAGE
CRISIS
NO
GOVT
IN
THE
WORLD
HAS
EVER
FACED
A
COMPARABLE
SITUATION
QUITE
PROBABLY
THERE
WAS
NO
MANNER
IN
WHICH
IT
COULD
BE
PEACEFULLY
RESOLVED
THE
BLAME
DOES
NOT
REST
ON
THE
FBI
IT
RESTS
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
KORESH
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
GET
SO
FAR
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
PERSON
WHO
TIPPED
THE
BD
OFF
IN
ADVANCE
HAS
THE
MURDER
OF
ATF
AGENTS
AND
CHILDREN
ON
HIS
OR
HER
CONSCIENCE
THERE
ARE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
US
WHO
PREDICT
THE
END
OF
SOCIETY
PREACH
SALVATION
THROUGH
ARMED
SECURITY
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THESE
ARE
THE
VERY
PEOPLE
WHO
POSE
THE
THREAT
TO
SOCIETY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THE
NEXT
WACO
MAY
NOT
BE
RELIGIOUS
NUTTERS
BUT
A
POLITICAL
MOVEMENT
A
SPLINTER
GROUP
OF
THE
KLU
KLUX
KLAN
TAKING
OVER
A
SCHOOLHOUSE
IN
A
BLACK
AREA
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
HOLDING
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
CHILDREN
HOSTAGE
THE
ONLY
POSSIBLE
SOLUTION
TO
SUCH
SITUATIONS
THAT
CAN
WORK
IS
TO
PREVENT
THEM
ARISING
NO
OTHER
GOVERNMENT
IN
THE
WORLD
HAS
FACED
SUCH
A
SITUATION
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
NO
OTHER
GOVERNMENT
HAS
SO
CARELESSLY
ALLOWED
HIGH
POWER
WEAPONRY
TO
BECOME
AVALIABLE
TO
ANY
LITTLE
HITLER
OR
WOULD
BE
MESSIAH
TO
SET
THEMSELVES
UP
AS

THEIR
OWN
LITTLE
