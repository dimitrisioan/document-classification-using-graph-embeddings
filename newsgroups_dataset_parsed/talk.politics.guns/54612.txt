writes
from
ap
according
to
numerous
accounts
by
those
in
the
compound
the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
if
there
was
a
large
propane
tank
and
it
was
breached
dont
you
think
that
there
would
be
an
identifiable
explosion
further
the
bd
members
have
as
much
reason
to
lie
as
the
govt
medical
examiners
have
found
no
bullet
wounds
as
was
stated
by
the
fbi
on
the
corpses
theyd
only
autopsied
one
body
when
this
information
was
released
i
wouldnt
doubt
though
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the
governments
story
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
the
only
evidence
that
exists
right
now
at
least
what
we
know
about
is
various
claims
and
counter
claims
im
waiting
until
the
hard
evidence
is
released
what

you
