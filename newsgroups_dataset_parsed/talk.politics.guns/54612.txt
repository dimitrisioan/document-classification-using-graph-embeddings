WRITES
FROM
AP
ACCORDING
TO
NUMEROUS
ACCOUNTS
BY
THOSE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
THE
FIRE
WAS
STARTED
BY
AN
ARMOURED
VEHICLE
CRUSHING
A
LARGE
PROPANE
TANK
AND
TURNING
OVER
NUMEROUS
GAS
LANTERNS
IF
THERE
WAS
A
LARGE
PROPANE
TANK
AND
IT
WAS
BREACHED
DONT
YOU
THINK
THAT
THERE

BE
AN
IDENTIFIABLE

LIE
AS
THE

MEDICAL

DESPITE
MUCH

TO
THE
CONTRARY
THE
ONLY
EVIDENCE
THAT
EXISTS
RIGHT
NOW
AT

WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
IS
VARIOUS
CLAIMS
AND
COUNTER
CLAIMS
IM
WAITING
UNTIL
THE
HARD
EVIDENCE
IS
RELEASED
WHAT
