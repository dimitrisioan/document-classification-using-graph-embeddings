IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
THIS
IS
MY
FIRST
TIME
ON
THE
NETWORK
BUT
I
AM
VERY
CONCERNED
WITH
THIS
INCIDENT
IN
WACO
I
WILL
REFRAIN
FROM
STATING
MY
OPINIONS
UNTIL
AFTER
I
HAVE
READ
THE
FAQ
COULD
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
HOW
TO
GET
THIS
I
MUST
SAY
THAT
I
BELIEVE
THE
GOVT
WAS
WRONG
IN
THE
ACTIONS
THAT
THEY
TOOK
IN
THIS
SITUATION
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
NO
FAQ
FOR
TPG
SOMEBODY
WAS
WORKING
ON
ONE
BUT
I
THINK
IT
DIED
IN
COMMITTEE
DAVID
VEAL
UNIVERSITY
OF
TENNESSEE
DIVISION
OF
CONTINUING
EDUCATION
I
STILL
REMEMBER
THE
WAY
YOU
LAUGHED
WHEN
YOU
PUSHED
ME
DOWN
THE
ELEVATOR
SHAFT
SOMETIMES
I
GET
TO
THINKING
YOU
DONT
LOVE
ME
ANYMORE
