re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
what
seems
to
be
happening
here
is
the
situation
getting
totally
blown
out
of
proportion
in
my
post
i
was
referring
to
your
regular
patrolman
in
a
car
cruising
around
the
city
vs
gang
members
of
course
the
police
have
access
to
the
things
that
you
mentioned
but
do
they
use
tanks
and
such
all
of
the
time
of
course
they
dont
and
thats
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
every
day
when
i
go
out
to
lunch
i
always
see
cops
coming
in
the
majority
that
i
see
are
still
carrying
revolvers
not
that
there
is
anything
wrong
with
a
revolver
but
if
youre
a
cop
that
is
up
against
some
gang
member
with
a
couple
of
automatics
in
his
coat
i
mean
semiauto
handguns
youre
going
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
even
with
training
i
have
been
at
a
shooting
range
where
gang
gang
members
were
practicing
shooting
they
were
actually
practicing
taking
out
their
guns
as
quick
as
possible
and
shooting
at
the
target
and
they
werent
doing
too
badly
either
the
university
cops
here
who
are
are
state
cops
are
armed
better
than
the
chicago
police
it
seems
most
state
cops
are
i
dont
know
where
you
are
originally
from
david
but
you
live
in
tennesse
and
i
live
in
chicago
and
see
this
crap
everyday
on
the
news
and
in
the
papers
i
think
the
situation
is
just
a
tad
different
here
than
there
however
dont
forget
that
the
police
in
chicago
can
carry
just
about
anything
they
want
except
for
the
glock
which
is
not
approved
for
carry
guess
they
figure
all
cops
are
like
the
police
chief
of
winnetka
who
happened
to
let
off
a
stray
round
of
this
is
the
same
antigun
police
chief
that
wanted
fullauto
uzis
for
his
patrol
cars
perhaps
in
the
judgement
of
the
majority
of
chicagos
finest
a
closeto
reliable
weapon
like
a
revolver
is
preferable
to
a
reliable
automatic
i
note
that
in
germany
where
certainly
the
semiauto
handgun
is
king
some
of
the
more
elite
police
types
want
revolvers
i
dont
think
the
issue
is
cost
because
chicago
police
certainly
make
on
the
order
of
at
least
your
presumption
of
disadvantage
i
think
is
not
borne
out
by
the
experiences
of
new
york
citys
cops
there
the
cops
usually
come
out
on
top
with
their
standard
spl
revolvers
ive
seen
sws
rugers
and
beretta
in
addition
to
the
revolvers
carried
by
chicago
cops
in
the
past
ive
seen
others
have
seen
browning
hipowers
jason
