RE
REWORDING
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
IDEAS
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
INDIVIDUALS
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
OWN
WEAPONS
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
WOULD
SUPPORT
A
NEIGHBORS
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
BIOLOGICAL
WEAPONS
AND
NERVE
GAS
ON
HISHER
PROPERTY
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
PROHIBITING
HAVING
BIOLOGICAL
WEAPONS
OR
NERVE
GAS
ON
HISHER
PROPERTY
OR
EVEN
WALKING
ON
GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY
WITH
SUCH
ITEMS
IPSO
FACTO
IT
IS
NOW
ONES
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
SUCH
WEAPONS
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
HELL
THE
US
PATENT
OFFICE
HAS
PATENTS
ON
THE
MANUFACTURE
OF
NERVE
GAS
THAT
ANYONE
CAN
OBTAIN
SIMPLY
BY
SENDING
A
TO
THE
PATENT
OFFICE
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
PO
BOX
THESE
SAME
PATENTS
ARE
VERBOTEN
TO
ENGLISH
CITIZENS
FROM
THEIR
OWN
PATENT
OFFICE
WHICH
DOESNT
SURPRISE
ME
BASED
ON
THE
MISTRUST
OF
THE
UK
GOVERNMENT
AGAINST
PRIVATE
OWNERSHIP
OF
SEMIAUTOMATIC
RIFLES
IF
WE
CANNOT
EVEN
AGREE
ON
KEEPING
WEAPONS
OF
MASS
DESTRUCTION
OUT
OF
THE
HANDS
OF
INDIVIDUALS
CAN
THERE
BE
ANY
HOPE
FOR
US
SO
YOU
ARE
SAYING
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
LEGISLATION
PROHIBITING
OWNING
BIOLOGICAL
WARFARE
AGENTS
OR
NERVE
AGENTS
WILL
YOU
PASS
LAWS
AGAINST
OWNING
CHLORINE
GAS
OR
CYANIDE
AS
WELL
WILL
YOU
PASS
LAWS
AGAINST
OWNING
ACETYLENE
GAS
THAT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
USED
AGAINST
THE
BRADLEY
IFVS
HAD
THE
BRANCH
DIVIDIANS
KNOWN
OF
THEIR
ANTICOMBUSTION
ENGINE
EFFECTS
WILL
YOU
PASS
LAWS
AGAINST
OWNING
CYLINDERS
OF
PROPANE
BECAUSE
THEY
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
USED
AS
FLAME
THROWERS
YES
THE
PROVERBIAL
ROAD
TO
HELL
ITS
ALWAYS
FOR
OUR
OWN
GOOD
