ANYBODY

ARLEN
SPECTRES
ADDRESS
I
WANT
TO
WRITE
TO
HIM
AND
THANK
HIM
FOR
SHOWING
THE
LEADERSHIP
TO
DEMAND
A
CONGRESSIONAL
INVESTIGATION
INTO
THE
WACO
MESS
KEN
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
MAN
WHO
AS
A
FEDERAL
ATTORNEY
DID
SO
MUCH
TO
FRUSTRATE
THE
PROPER
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
JFK
ASSASSINATION
BY
THE
HOUSE
SUBCOMMITTEE
ON
ASSASSINATIONS
FOX
AND
HEN
HOUSE
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
MY
ABOVE
COMMENT
WAS
NOT
INTENDED
AS
A
FLAME
OF
KENS
CALL
FOR
CONGRESSIONAL
LEADERSHIP
TO
CONDUCT
A
PROPER
INVESTIGATION
IT
WAS
MERELY
TO
CALL
ATTENTION
TO
THE
HAZARD
OF
HAVING
SPECTER
INVOLVED
IF
ANYONE
TOOK
IT
THAT
WAY
I
APOLOGIZE
JOE
GAUT
IN
THE
SUPERSTATE
IT
REALLY
DOES
NOT
FGAUTJWCCSVAXSFASUEDU

AT
ALL
WHAT
ACTUALLY
HAPPENED
REMEMBER
THE
ALAMO
TRUTH
IS
WHAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
CHOOSES
TO
REMEMBER
WACO
TELL
YOU
JUSTICE
IS
WHAT
IT
WANTS
TO
HAPPEN
