could
a
further
wait
have
resulted
in
a
different
outcome
this
i
doubt
while
i
question
the
atfs
initial
raid
i
believe
that
the
remainder
of
the
standoff
was
handled
fairly
well
with
the
single
exception
of
the
psychological
warfare
by
blaring
music
etc
i
think
that
was
uncalled
for
and
probably
hindered
the
outcome
but
suppose
they
had
waited
the
worst
outcome
would
have
been
the
one
that
actually
did
but
with
the
fbiatf
just
standing
there
watching
instead
of
being
a
part
of
the
problem
it
then
would
have
been
very
clear
exactly
who
was
at
fault
then
rather
than
the
way
it
turned
out
and
that
would
have
been
the
worst
case
the
best
would
have
been
they
finally
get
hungry
and
come
out
possiblelikely
well
the
alternative
was
worse
one
other
point
im
no
fan
of
janet
reno
but
i
do
like
the
way
she
had
the
balls
to
go
ahead
and
take
full
responsibility
seems
like
the
waffle
boy
had
problems
figuring
out
just
where
he
stood
on
the
issue
which
is
actually
rather
refreshing
nowadays
most
of
the
time
the
higherups
claim
i
dont
remember
or
i
had
no
involvement
but
what
does
it
matter
why
say
i
dont
remember
when
it
doesnt
make
any
difference
altho
the
clintonettes
have
been
pretty
good
at
lying
when
it
wasnt
necessary
they
didnt
do
it
this
time
but
it
wasnt
necessary
claiming
full
responsibility
is
a
totall
meaningless
gesture
symbolism
over
substance
again
ive
offered
to
take
full
responsibility
when
do
they
pay
me
the
big
bucks
