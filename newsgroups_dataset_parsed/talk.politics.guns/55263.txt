WRITES
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
WHOLE
GUNSFORPROTECTION
MINDSET
IT
IGNORES
THE
SYSTEMIC
EFFECTS
OF
CUMULATIVE
INDIVIDUAL
ACTIONS
IF
YOU
WANT
FIRE
INSURANCE
ON
YOUR
HOUSE
THATS
PRUDENT
AND
IT
HAS
NO
EFFECT
ON
ME
BUT
IF
YOU
AND
A
BUNCH
OF
OTHER
PARANOIDS
ARE
PACKING
HANDGUNS
IN
THE
BACKCOUNTRY
IT
MAKES
ME
AND
ANYONE
ELSE
WHO
DOESNT
CHOSE
TO
PROTECT
HIMSELF
IN
THIS
MANNER
PRETTY
FKING
NERVOUS
WHY
IF
YOURE
NOT
A
THREAT
YOURE
NOT
AFFECTED
AT
ALL
AHA
THATS
THE
PART
THAT
MAKES
ME
NERVOUS
TOO
WHO
GETS
TO
DECIDE
IF
I
AM
A
THREAT
WHEN
I
MIGHT
POSSIBLY
BE
ON
THE
RECEIVING
END
OF
A
VIOLENT
GESTURE
THEN
I
GET
TO
DECIDE
FOR
MYSELF
IF
SOMEONE
DOES
NOT
LIKE
IT
TOO
BAD
I
WOULD
BE
DOING
EXACTLY
WHAT
YOU
OR
ANY
OTHER
LIVING
CREATURE
WOULD
DO
IN
TERMS
OF
EVALUATION
WHATS
THE
BIG
DEAL
BASED
ON
APPEARANCE
SOMETIMES
WOULD
SOMEONE
FEEL
MORE
THREATENED
WHEN
APPROACHED
BY
A
VERY
DIRTY
SMELLY
SLIGHTLYMANIACAL
LOOKING
PERSON
WITH
A
SLIGHT
GLAZE
TO
THE
EYES
MUTTERING
TO
HIMSELF
I
MIGHT
DOESNT
THIS
DESCRIBE
MOST
BACKPACKERS
AFTER
THEYVE
BEEN
OUT
MORE
THAN
A
COUPLE
OF
DAYS
NOT
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
AND
LET
US
NOT
FORGET
THAT
CONTEXT
IS
OFTEN
AN
IMPORTANT
FACTOR
IN
EVALUATING
A
SITUATION
SEEING
DISHEVELED
PERSONS
ON
A
HIKING
TRAIL
IS
NOT
LIKELY
TO
BE
EVALUATED
EQUALLY
WITH
MEETING
A
GRIMEY
SORT
AS
DESCRIBED
ABOVE
ON
A
LONELY
CITY
STREET
AT
AM
ANYONE
THAT
CANNOT
PROPERLY
DISCRIMINATE
BETWEEN
THESE
TWO
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
IS
LEGITIMATE
FODDER
FOR
THE
OLD
SURVIVAL
OF
THE
FITTEST
PRINCIPLE
OR
BASED
ON
SOMETHING
ELSE
PROXIMITY
NO
ROOM
TO
PASS
ON
THE
TRAIL
WITHOUT
GETTING
REAL
CLOSE
TO
SOMEONE
AN
INNER
SENSE
NOW
IM
REALLY
GETTING
NERVOUS
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOU
DOUBT
YOUR
OWN
ABILITIES
YOU
SOUND
PRETTY
TYPICAL
IN
THIS
RESPECT
YOU
ALSO
SEEM
TO
THINK
THAT
YOULL
BE
SAFE
OR
SAFER
IF
OTHERS
ARE
UNARMED
THIS
IS
DANGEROUS
FANTASY
TWICE
WHEN
I
WAS
HIKING
THE
AT
I
CAME
UP
ON
A
SHELTER
THAT
I
WAS
PLANNING
ON
STAYING
AT
AND
SAW
SOMEONE
SITTING
THERE
CLEANING
HIS
GUN
SOFTLY
I
BACKED
AWAY
AND
HIKED
ANOTHER
MILES
TO
GET
OUT
OF
THERE
ILL
FREELY
ADMIT
IT
HERE
IM
NOT
AFRAID
OF
GUNS
IM
AFRAID
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
BRING
THEM
INTO
THE
BACKCOUNTRY
THEN
YOU
ARE
IN
NEED
OF
SOME
FORM
OF
THERAPY
NOT
NECESSARILY
THAT
OF
AN
ANALYST
BUT
MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
LEARN
ABOUT
GUNS
YOUR
FEAR
IS
SEEMS
TO
BE
BASED
IN
IGNORANCE
AND
FALSE
KNOWLEDGE
YOU
SEE
A
PERSON
WITH
A
GUN
AND
YOU
FEEL
THREATENED
WHY
IS
THIS
SO
HAVE
YOU
ANY
LEGITIMATE
BASIS
FOR
THIS
ANY
FIRSTHAND
EXPERIENCE
THAT
LENDS
VALIDITY
TO
YOUR
FEARS
OR
ARE
YOUR
FEARS
BASED
ON
MEDIATED
EXPERIENCE
IE
THE
ANECDOTES
OF
OTHERS
SUCH
AS
NETWORK
NEWS
I
TRUST
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
LACK
OF
LEGITIMACY
IN
SUCH
MEDIATED
INPUTS
AND
WHY
ARE
YOU
AFRAID
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AS
MENTIONED
ABOVE
FORGIVE
ME
BUT
YOU
SOUND
AFRAID
TO
THE
POINT
OF
PARANOIA
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULD
TALK
TO
SOMEONE
ABOUT
THIS
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THIS
TO
BE
RUDE
OR
FASCETIOUS
BUT
I
THINK
ANYONE
WITH
FEAR
AS
DEEP
AND
BASELESS
AS
YOURS
SEEMS
TO
BE
NEEDS
SOME
SORT
OF
HELP
LIVING
IN
FEAR
REALLY
SUCKS
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
ONLY
WHEN
AROUND
PEOPLE
WITH
GUNS
IN
THE
BACK
COUNTRY
TELL
ME
WOULD
YOU
BE
AS
FEARFUL
OF
A
PARK
RANGER
WHO
WAS
RIGHT
IN
FRONT
OF
YOU
WITH
THEIR
SIDE
ARM
IN
CLEAR
VIEW
WHY
OR
WHY
NOT
