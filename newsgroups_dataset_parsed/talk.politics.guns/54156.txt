the
second
amendment
is
about
sovereignty
not
sporting
goods
perfectly
correct
but
it
wont
make
any
difference
i
agree
sad
but
true
self
defense
is
a
valid
reason
for
rkba
the
vast
majority
get
through
life
without
ever
having
to
own
use
or
display
a
firearm
besides
there
are
other
means
of
selfprotection
which
can
be
just
as
effective
as
firearms
please
name
one
freedoms
and
rights
are
not
dependent
on
public
opinion
necessity
or
scientific
scrutiny
new
to
this
planet
everything
is
dependent
on
either
public
or
political
opinion
usually
political
to
imagine
that
inalienable
rights
are
somehow
wired
into
the
vast
cold
cosmos
is
purest
egotism
and
a
dangerous
delusion
upon
which
our
bill
of
rights
is
based
some
delusion
no
arguments
against
rkba
can
withstand
scientific
scrutiny
they
dont
have
to
like
so
many
other
things
the
issue
is
one
of
perception
rather
than
boring
statistics
every
time
some
young
innocent
is
gunneddown
in
a
drive
by
every
time
some
kid
is
murdered
for
a
jacket
every
time
a
store
clerk
is
executed
for
three
dollars
in
change
every
time
some
moron
kills
his
wife
because
she
took
the
last
beer
from
the
fridge
every
time
someone
hears
a
bang
in
the
night
the
rkba
dies
the
stats
are
not
all
that
clearly
behind
firearms
the
protection
factor
does
not
strongly
outweigh
the
mindless
mayhem
factor
given
society
as
we
now
experience
it
it
seems
safer
to
get
rid
of
as
many
guns
as
possible
that
may
be
an
error
but
enough
active
voters
believe
in
that
course
if
this
were
not
true
in
practice
then
certain
unethical
politicians
would
not
be
passing
gun
control
laws
politicians
are
generally
whores
to
public
opinion
this
does
not
mean
the
the
public
is
either
well
informed
or
correct
as
for
the
stats
anyone
can
support
anything
with
the
right
stats
the
right
stats
from
what
ive
seen
are
sometimes
even
used
to
support
conflicting
sides
of
the
same
issue
how
do
you
intend
to
silence
rkba
supporters
talk
all
you
want
talk
about
the
good
old
days
when
you
used
to
own
firearms
after
a
while
such
talk
will
take
on
the
character
of
war
stories
and
no
one
will
be
very
interested
anymore
used
to
own
firearms
while
armed
insurrection
as
the
ffs
of
the
const
may
have
envisioned
seems
to
me
a
somewhat
fanatical
approach
to
avoiding
this
political
protest
is
still
an
option
at
this
point
i
agree
that
its
argueably
not
enough
andor
too
late
if
all
else
fails
