re
clinton
joins
list
of
genocidal
socialist
leaders
in
article
writes
people
like
you
cheapen
our
constitution
by
using
it
to
defend
sociopaths
who
arent
deserved
of
it
get
a
life
and
chill
on
the
paranoia
i
dont
care
about
cults
theres
no
language
problem
here
my
problem
is
with
religious
fanatics
claiming
to
be
god
is
just
a
little
bit
unsettling
stockpiling
several
years
supply
of
canned
foods
no
crime
here
and
enough
weapons
to
hold
off
a
company
no
crime
here
not
to
mention
the
atf
which
ed
up
in
the
first
place
and
talking
about
how
theyre
going
to
take
care
of
all
of
the
unbelievers
no
crime
here
also
no
substantiation
of
your
claim
that
koresh
said
this
i
for
one
have
never
heard
this
mentioned
before
where
did
you
hear
it
but
granted
up
to
that
moment
hed
done
nothing
wrong
i
recognize
and
respect
that
up
to
which
moment
the
one
where
you
decided
that
anyone
who
claims
to
be
god
no
longer
has
the
protection
of
the
constitution
what
happened
to
the
separation
of
church
and
state
then
the
atf
discovers
he
doesnt
have
proper
permits
for
some
of
his
purchases
and
failed
to
pay
some
taxes
on
them
i
have
yet
to
see
any
evidence
of
this
either
from
what
i
hear
the
original
warrant
the
reason
for
the
feb
raid
is
still
sealed
what
are
unsealed
seem
to
be
warrants
taken
out
after
the
initial
raid
then
several
parents
come
forward
and
demand
that
previous
charges
of
child
abuse
be
refiled
there
have
been
interviews
with
some
parents
whose
children
were
in
the
compound
at
some
point
funny
i
havent
seen
any
of
these
interviews
interesting
that
when
the
social
services
agencies
investigated
koresh
on
these
previous
charges
they
found
absolutely
no
evidence
of
abuse
these
parents
claimed
psychological
and
sexual
abuse
the
childrens
statements
supported
these
charges
funny
i
dont
remember
hearing
anything
about
childrens
statements
either
where
did
you
say
you
heard
all
this
what
i
heard
was
that
none
of
the
children
who
left
the
compound
early
in
the
seige
exhibited
any
signs
typical
of
abuse
physical
or
mental
this
from
the
newspaper
and
national
tv
news
did
you
also
hear
that
its
the
job
of
the
batf
and
the
fbi
to
lay
siege
to
homes
where
child
abuse
is
suspected
i
thought
you
did
was
it
a
noknock
i
really
havent
heard
anything
on
that
but
clearly
he
was
not
just
another
guy
minding
his
own
business
clearly
please
tell
us
what
koresh
was
doing
that
can
be
construed
as
other
than
minding
his
own
business
before
the
batf
raided
the
place
hell
give
them
all
the
guns
in
the
world
if
they
dont
bother
anyone
but
he
was
a
scary
sort
dont
you
think
the
sort
of
person
youd
want
your
daughter
to
date
i
didnt
think
so
reason
number
one
to
doubt
the
legal
statements
made
by
some
of
the
survivors
your
logic
just
amazes
me
i
think
your
grandparents
who
died
in
auschwitz
would
be
turning
over
in
their
graves
if
they
could
hear
how
cavalierly
you
throw
away
peoples
protection
of
law
because
you
think
theyre
scary
and
not
the
sort
of
person
youd
want
your
daughter
to
date
what
sort
of
people
do
you
suppose
the
nazis
thought
your
grandparents
were
probably
not
the
sort
theyd
want
their
little
frauleins
dating
note
that
some
of
them
were
made
by
his
guard
wellhesitate
to
say
expertly
trained
killers
and
next
i
suppose
youll
tell
us
exactly
who
these
welltrained
killers
have
killed
then
he
fired
on
the
atf
thats
not
just
a
little
mistake
or
some
redwhiteand
blue
american
defending
his
home
against
big
brother
that
shit
doesnt
fly
because
you
said
so
right
right
anyone
with
his
background
that
will
shoot
and
kill
federal
law
enforcement
officials
is
not
some
good
citizen
whose
crusade
enjoys
our
support
so
someone
with
a
different
background
say
someone
who
didnt
claim
to
be
the
messiah
in
your
book
could
shoot
and
kill
federal
law
enforcement
officials
would
be
a
good
citizen
whose
crusade
enjoys
our
support
hes
a
loose
cannon
just
my
opinion
worth
the
paper
its
printed
on
youre
amazing
simply
amazing
joe
