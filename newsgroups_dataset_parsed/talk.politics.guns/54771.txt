POINT
OUT
THAT
EVEN
IF
THE
FIRE
WAS
SET
BY
SOMEONE
INSIDE
OF
THE
BUILDING
IT
CAME
AS
A
DIRECT
RESULT
OF
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
FBIBATF
AND
THE
PEOPLE
INSIDE
INCLUDING
CHILDREN
DESERVED
A
TRIAL
INSTEAD
OF
THIS
WELL
THEY
HAD
OVER
DAYS
TO
COME
OUT
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
UP
ON
NATIONAL
TV
TO
GET
THE
TRIAL
THEY
DESERVED
INSTEAD
THEY
CHOSE
TO
SET
FIRE
TO
THEIR
COMPUND
HOURS
AFTER
THE
TANKS
DROPPED
OFF
THE
TEAR
GAS
CORRECTION
THE
FBI
SAYS
THAT
THE
DAVIDIANS
SET
FIRE
TO
THEIR
BUILDINGS
AND
I
SUPPOSE
THE
FBI
ALSO
PREVENTED
THEM
FROM
COMING
OUT
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
UP
WHILE
NATIONAL
TV
CAMERAS
WATCH
WELL
THE
ATTORNEYS
OF
THE
DAVIDIANS
REPORTED
ON
LARRY
KING
THAT
THE
TANKS
HAD
ACTUALLY
DAMAGED
THE
STRUCTURE
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
EFFECTUATING
EGRESS
FROM
THE
BUILDING
WAS
DIFFICULT
AT
BEST
WITH
A
RAPIDLY
SPREADING
FIRE
AND
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
SMOKE
AND
TEAR
GAS
FINDING
THE
RIGHT
EXITS
OR
ACCEPTIBLE
HOLES
IN
THE
WALLS
WERE
NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE
I
FIND
THIS
EXPLANATION
TO
BE
COMPLETELY
PLAUSIBLE
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
ITS
TRUE
BUT
I
DONT
FIND
IT
INTRINSICALLY
LESS
BELIEVABLE
THAN
THE
GOVERNMENT
STORIES
THE
FBI
ALSO
SAID
THAT
THE
DAVIDIANS
HAD
A
METHANPHETAMINE
LAB
IN
THEIR
BASEMENT
AND
THAT
THE
DAVIDIANS
HAD
CAL
MACHINE
GUNS
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
EVERYTHING
THE
FBI
SAYS
DO
YOU
DISBELIEVE
EVERYTHING
THE
FBI
SAYS
I
BALANCE
MY
GUT
REACTION
TO
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
INDEPENDENT
FACTS
AS
I
SEE
THEM
ON
VIDEO
I
USUALLY
ADOPT
THE
SCENARIO
THAT
IS
SIMPLEST
AND
MOST
PLAUSIBLE
I
DO
NOT
GENERALLY
BELIEVE
IN
CONSPIRACY
THEORIES
THAT
INVOLVE
COMPLICATED
AND
UNLIKELY
SCENARIOS
I
CONCUR
THE
BATF
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
DEVOID
OF
FAULT
IN
THE
HANDLING
OF
THIS
AFFAIR
BUT
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THEY
MAY
HAVE
INTENTIONALLY
STARTED
THE
FIRE
IS
LUDICROUS
INDEED
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LAWYERS
THE
DAVIDIAN
SURVIVORS
SAY
THAT
LANTERNS
WERE
KNOCKED
OVER
DURING
THE
PROBING
AND
THATS
HOW
THE
FIRE
STARTED
A
TRAGIC
ACCIDENT
IF
TRUE
DO
YOU
TRUST
THAT
SNIVELLING
LITTLE
PIECE
OF
SHT
SPECIAL
AGENT
RICKS
HE
SEEMS
TO
THINK
HE
IS
A
COMEDIAN
AND
THE
MEDIA
WHO
LAUGH
AT
HIS
SICK
JOKES
ARE
JUST
AS
GUILTY
AS
HE
IMHO
UP
UNTIL
NOW
THE
BATF
HAD
BEEN
MAKING
ME
SICK
TODAY
THE
PEOPLE
INSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
WHO
SET
THE
FIRE
MADE
ME
SICK
KEEPING
THE
CHILDREN
INSIDE
THE
COMPUND
WHEN
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
RELEASED
EARLIER
WITH
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
WEEKS
AGO
IS
ABSOLUTELY
INEXCUSEABLE
NOT
RELEASING
THEM
BEFORE
DECIDING
TO
SET
THE
PLACE
AFIRE
IS
THE
WORK
OF
MADMEN
TWO
OF
THE
NINE
WHO
ESCAPED
THE
COMPOUND
SAID
THE
FIRE
WAS
DELIBERATELY
SET
BY
CULT
MEMBERS
CORRECTION
THE
FBI
SAYS
THAT
TWO
OF
THE
NINE
SAID
THE
FIRE
WAS
DELIBERATELY
SET
BY
THE
SECT
MEMBERS
IF
THE
FIRE
WERE
SET
BY
ACCIDENT
OR
BY
PEOPLE
OUTSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
I
WOULD
HAVE
EXPECTED
FAR
MORE
CULT
MEMBERS
TO
FLEE
THE
COMPOUND
OR
AT
LEAST
COME
OUT
SHOOTING
SEE
ABOVE
THIS
ONE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
THOROUGHLY
INVESTIGATED
MAYBE
WELL
EVENTUALLY
GET
SOME
IDEA
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
MY
VIEW
IS
THAT
FROM
BEGINNING
TO
END
THIS
OPERATION
WAS
A
BOTCH
AND
THAT
IT
IS
COMPLETELY
POSSIBLE
THAT
NUT
CASES
WHO
WERE
OTHERWISE
LAWABIDING
CITIZENS
WERE
VICTIMS
OF
A
BUREAUCRATIC
EXECUTION
