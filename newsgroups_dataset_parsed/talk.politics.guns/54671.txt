WRITES

TEXAS
LATELY
YES
THE
GOVERNMENT
TAKES
CARE
OF
US
ALL
DOESNT
IT
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
BELONG
TO
A
GOVERNMENTSANCTIONED
RELIGION
EXCUSE
ME
BUT
DIDNT
THESE
GUNLADDEN
CULT
MEMBERS
THREATEN
SHOOT
AND
KILL
SOME
PEOPLE
THEY
THREATENED
NO
ONE
THEIR
NEIGHBOURS
THOUGHT
THEY
WERE
A
LITTLE
STRANGE
BUT
ALL
IN
ALL
THE
KIND
OF
PEOPLE
YOU
WOULD
WANT
TO
LIVE
NEXT
DOOR
TO
ONE
VERSION
HAS
THE
BATF
SERVING
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
BY
JUMPING
OUT
OF
A
HORSE
TRAILER
WITH
GUNS
AND
TOSSING
CONCUSSION
GRENADES
IF
THIS
IS
THE
TRUE
ORDER
OF
EVENTS
THEN
THE
CULT
COULD
NOT
KNOW
THAT
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
WAS
BEING
SERVED
AND
SINCE
THERE
WAS
NO
PROOF
THAT
THESE
GUYS
WERE
POLICE
THE
CULT
HAD
EVERY
RIGHT
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
TORCHING
THEMSELVES
SHOWS
BRILIANT
TACTICS
AND
CONVINCES
ME
THEY
REALY
BELONG
IN
SOCIETY
IF
YOU
WATCH
ACTUAL
FOOTAGE
OF
THE
FIRE
FROM
START
TO
FINISH
IT
IS
NOT
AT
ALL
CLEAR
THAT
FIRE
WASNT
STARTED
BY
THE
TANKS
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
SURVIVED
ARE
CLAIMING
THAT
THE
FIRE
WAS
STARTED
BY
THE
TANKS
KNOCKING
OVER
SOME
KEROSENE
LANTERNS
THE
FBI
IS
CLAIMING
THAT
THE
CULT
STARTED
THE
FIRE
THEY
REALY
BELONG
IN
SOCIETY
IS
A
CATCHY
PHRASE
BUT
IM
PERSONALLY
WAITING
TO
SEE
WHAT
THE
TEXAS
RANGERS
HAVE
TO
SAY
ABOUT
IT
ALL
BEFORE
I
PASS
JUDGMENT
WHY
DONT
YOU
DO
THE
SAME
SOME
MORE
INTERESTING
FACTS
ABOUT
THE
WACO
INCIDENT
THE
ORIGINAL
ASSAULT
WAS
CONDUCTED
BY
BATF
OFFICERS
WEARING
AN
ASSORTED
TYPES
OF
CAMOUFLAGE
I
SAW
ON
CNN
AT
LEAST
THREE
DIFFERENT
TYPES
I
WOULD
BE
HARD
PRESSED
TO
IDENTIFY
A
BUNCH
OF
GUYS
IN
BRINGYOUROWN
BATTLE
FATIGUES
AS
UNIFORMED
OFFICERS
OF
THE
LAW
EVEN
IF
THEY
WERE
CLAIMING
TO
BE
POLICE
THE
BATF
HAS
BEEN
LYING
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
WE
ONLY
HAD
HANDGUNS
THE
ORIGINAL
FOOTAGE
SHOWED
BATF
OFFICERS
ON
A
ROOF
TOP
GETTING
SHOT
AT
ONE
HAD
AN
ASSAULT
SUBMACHINE
GUN
WE
WERE
OUT
GUNNED
SUBMACHINE
GUNS
AND
SHOTGUNS
ARE
THE
BEST
IN
QUARTERS
WEAPON
YOU
CANT
BE
OUT
GUNNED
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
THE
BEST
GUNS
AVAILABLE
FOR
THE
JOB
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
THEY
HAD
GUNS
THAT
WOULD
SHOOT
THROUGH
DOORS
THIS
ONE
IS
THE
BEST
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
GUNS
THAT
WONT
SHOOT
THROUGH
A
HOUSEHOLD
DOOR
OR
THROUGH
A
HOUSE
WALL
FOR
THAT
MATTER
SINCE
OFFICERS
FROM
THE
BUREAU
OF
ALCOHOL
TOBACCO
AND
FIREARMS
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
EITHER
LYING
OR
INCREDIBLY
INCOMPETENT
NOT
TO
MENTION
CRIMINALLY
NEGLIGENT
IF
THEY
ARE
SHOOTING
BULLETS
THAT
THEY
THINK
WILL
STOP
WHEN
THE
ENCOUNTER
PLYWOOD
WE
HAD
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
ACTUALLY
WE
HAD
AN
ARREST
WARRANT
NO
WAIT
WE
HAD
BOTH
YEAH
THATS
THE
TICKET
OH
AND
THEYRE
CHILD
MOLESTERS
TOO
AND
THEY
MAKE
DRUGS
DID
WE
MENTION
WE
THINK
THEY
HAVE
ROCKET
LAUNCHERS
THE
STORY
FROM
BATF
AND
FBI
SPOKESPEOPLE
HAS
CHANGED
DAILY
AND
THEIR
CLAIMS
WERE
GETTING
INCREASINGLY
OUTRAGEOUS
THROUGHOUT
THE
SIEGE
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
HAVE
BE
CLAIMING
THAT
ONE
OF
THEIR
BIGGEST
CONCERNS
WAS
THAT
KORESH
AND
HIS
FOLLOWERS
WOULD
MASS
SUICIDE
NOW
THEY
ARE
CLAIMING
THAT
THATS
WHAT
HE
DID
AND
THAT
THEY
ARE
SURPRISED
THAT
HE
DID
HUH
ALL
IN
ALL
I
THINK
THAT
ANYTHING
THE
FBI
AND
BATF
SAY
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
WITH
A
GRAIN
