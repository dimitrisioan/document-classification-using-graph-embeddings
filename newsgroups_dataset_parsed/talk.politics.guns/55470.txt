RE

BURNS
DIVIDIAN
RANCH
NO

AS
QUOTED
FROM

NATHAN
ENGLE
WHAT
DID
THOSE
PEOPLE
DO
WRONG
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THAT
IS
WHAT
I
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
THEY
ASSEMBLED
A
FRIGHTENING
ARSENAL
OF
WEAPONS
BY
CIRCUMVENTING
LAWS
WHICH
WERE
INTENDED
TO
PREVENT
SUCH
A
BUILDUP
THEN
LATER
THEY
USED
SOME
OF
THOSE
WEAPONS
TO
KILL
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IM
SURE
THEY
WERE
FRIGHTENED
WHEN
THEY
SAW
ALL
THOSE
BATF
OFFICERS
CLOSING
IN
BUT
IN
RETROSPECT
I
CANT
SEE
HOW
THEIR
SUBSEQUENT
GUNFIGHT
COULD
BE
EXPECTED
TO
IMPROVE
THE
SITUATION
WHAT
LAWS
DID
THEY
CIRCUMVENT
BEING
FRIGHTENING
ISNT
A
CRIME
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
AFRAID
OF
YOUNG
BLACK
MALES
THAT
DOESNT
MAKE
THE
MERE
STATUS
OF
BEING
A
YOUNG
BLACK
MALE
A
CRIME
THE
BATF
ITSELF
ADMITTED
LEADING
OFF
BY
THROWING
HANDGRENADES
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THEY
PROPERLY
IDENTIFIED
THEMSELVES
AS
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
PERSONNEL
UNDER
THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OTHER
PERSONS
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND
TO
BE
ACTING
WITHIN
THEIR
LEGAL
RIGHTS
TO
EXERCISE
SELF
DEFENSE
AGAINST
UNIDENTIFIED
ARMED
INTRUDERS
AT
THIS
POINT
I
PLACE
LITTLE
OR
NO
CREDIBILITY
ON
ANY
OF
THE
CHARGES
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
OR
MOLESTATION
BUT
I
WOULD
REMIND
YOU
THAT
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
ARENT
THE
ONLY
ONES
BURYING
THEIR
DEAD
THE
CHARGES
ARE
IRRLEVANT
ANYWAY
SINCE
THE
BATF
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
JURISDICTION
IN
SUCH
MATTERS
ANYWAY
OF
COURSE
THAT
HASNT
STOPPED
THEM
FROM
MAKING
OTHER
SUCH
SPURIOUS
CHARGES
SUCH
AS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
MYTHICAL
METH
LABS
OF
COURSE
THEY
WHOLE
CULT
THING
INDICATES
THE
LEVEL
OF
CONTEMPT
THAT
THEY
HAVE
FOR
THE
AMENDMENT
SURE
THEY
WERE
CRAZY
NO
DOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
BUT
WHAT
DID
THEY
DO
WRONG
THEY
ATTEMPTED
TO
STAGE
AN
ARMED
RESISTANCE
TO
FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES
UNDER
CONDITIONS
THAT
PLACED
DOZENS
OF
UNARMED
AND
INNOCENT
PEOPLE
IN
THE
LINE
OF
FIRE
THAT
ARMED
RESISTANCE
AT
LEAST
INITIALLY
MAY
WELL
HAVE
BEEN
LEGAL
YOURE
