for
me
though
the
black
soot
billowing
outside
the
compound
added
with
how
fast
the
fire
spread
ponted
to
someone
dousing
large
parts
of
the
compound
with
some
sort
of
gasoline
or
firestarter
lots
of
house
fires
give
off
black
sooty
smoke
and
as
far
as
the
speed
of
the
fire
the
winds
were
gusting
to
at
least
that
day
i
guess
youre
forgetting
the
way
oakland
and
berkeley
looked
back
in
did
those
folks
use
accelerants
smg
i
doubt
the
feds
did
that
as
they
were
more
interested
in
arresting
vernon
the
real
unbalanced
one
at
least
the
one
that
lost
his
cool
was
vernon
so
i
figured
that
he
was
more
likely
to
do
it
after
all
he
was
jesus
being
persecuted
by
the
authorities
and
had
followers
to
hold
onto
so
made
the
decision
he
and
his
followers
also
probably
felt
that
they
were
rocketing
to
heaven
by
doing
this
stuff
thsi
conclusion
i
came
to
after
umpteen
million
hours
of
listening
to
npr
and
other
radio
shows
i
always
have
the
radio
going
when
i
am
in
my
office
on
some
innocuous
talkshow
or
news
program
as
background
