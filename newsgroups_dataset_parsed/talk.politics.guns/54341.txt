WRONG
ABOUT
THE
WHOLE
GUNSFORPROTECTION
MINDSET
IT
IGNORES
THE
WHY
IF
YOURE
NOT
A
THREAT
YOURE
NOT
AFFECTED
AT
ALL
AHA
THATS
THE
PART
THAT
MAKES
ME
NERVOUS
TOO
WHO
GETS
TO
DECIDE
IF
I
AM
A
THREAT
BASED
ON
APPEARANCE
WOULD
SOMEONE
FEEL
MORE
THREATENED
ACTIONS
DETERMINE
WHETHER
SOMEONE
PRESENTS
A
THREAT
AND
I
DONT
CARRY
A
GUN
SO
MUCH
FOR
PEOPLE
CAUSE
I
TEND
TO
FADE
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
ABOUT
BUT
DUE
TO
SEVERAL
ENCOUNTERS
WITH
FORMERLY
DOMESTIC
DOGS
THESE
CRITTERS
AINT
SCARED
OF
FOLKS
AND
CAN
GET
AGGRESSIVE
ON
STAYING
AT
AND
SAW
SOMEONE
SITTING
THERE
CLEANING
HIS
GUN
SOFTLY
I
BACKED
AWAY
AND
HIKED
ANOTHER
MILES
TO
GET
OUT
OF
THERE
ILL
FREELY
ADMIT
IT
HERE
IM
NOT
AFRAID
OF
GUNS
IM
AFRAID
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
BRING
THEM
INTO
THE
BACKCOUNTRY
ID
COUNT
THAT
AS
A
FEAR
OF
GUNS
SOMEBODY
HAVING
THE
SENSE
TO
KEEP
THEIR
WEAPONS
MAINTAINED
ISNT
AS
LIKELY
TO
PRESENT
A
THREAT
THE
ARMY
TAUGHT
ME
TO
CLEAN
ANY
WEAPONS
DAILY
SINCE
THEY
USUALLY
NEED
IT
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
THEYVE
BEEN
USED
YOUD
BE
AMAZED
HOW
SWEATY
A
HOLSTER
CAN
GET
OR
HOW
MUCH
TRAIL
DUST
WILL
GET
IN
IT
AND
I
GUESS
YOUD
BE
SCARED
OF
ME
AND
MY
FORMER
EXPLORER
POST
SEEMS
THE
ADVISORS
WERE
NATIONAL
GUARD
SPECIAL
FORCES
GRUNTS
AND
CONSIDERED
IT
HERESY
TO
BE
OUT
IN
THE
WOODS
WITHOUT
A
WEAPON
COURSE
USUALLY
YOU
WOULDNT
NOTICE
EM
THEY
TENDED
TO
AVOID
PUBLIC
SCRUTINY
OF
COURSE
THAT
MAY
BE
THE
WAY
TO
SOLVE
THE
SOLITUDE
PROBLEM
JUST
CARRY
A
GUN
AND
DISPLAY
IT
PROMINENTLY
AND
ONE
PROBABLY
WONT
SEE
MOST
OF
THE
OTHER
HIKERS
OUT
THERE
WHO
WILL
BE
HIDING
IN
THE
WOODS
DANIA
MY
GOES
IN
A
HIP
HOLSTER
MIXED
IN
WITH
MAGAZINE
POUCHES
HOLD
LOTSA
STUFF
IN
THEM
CANTEENS
KNIVES
COMPASSES
AND
SUCH
NOT
SO
EASY
TO
NOTICE
IN
THE
OFF
CHANCE
I
DECIDE
TO
BE
VISIBLE
I
PREFER
NOT
TO
BE
SINCE
WALKING
QUIETLY
AWAY
FROM
ACTIVE
AREAS
INCREASES
THE
NUMBER
OF
NONHUMAN
TYPE
CRITTERS
I
