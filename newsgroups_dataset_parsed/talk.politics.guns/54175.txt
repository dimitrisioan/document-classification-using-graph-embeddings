what
all
you
turkey
propistol
and
automatic
weapons
fanatics
dont
seem
to
realize
is
that
the
rest
of
us
laugh
at
you
you
dont
make
me
angry
you
just
make
me
chuckle
thats
nice
we
strive
for
entertainment
value
i
remeber
being
in
bellingham
washington
and
seeing
a
pickup
truck
in
front
of
the
car
that
my
friend
and
i
were
in
it
had
a
bumper
sticker
proclaiming
gun
control
is
a
firm
grip
on
a
now
im
sure
that
that
wanker
thought
he
was
pretty
cool
what
he
didnt
realize
was
that
we
took
a
photo
of
the
back
of
his
truck
and
showed
it
to
our
friends
when
we
got
back
to
vancouver
canada
where
im
from
originally
people
were
guffawing
at
the
basic
stupidity
of
such
a
sticker
and
the
even
greater
stupidity
of
the
person
who
put
it
there
in
the
first
place
in
the
first
place
you
have
to
realize
the
feeling
goes
both
ways
canadians
laugh
at
the
us
and
americans
simply
shrug
and
woner
why
the
hell
we
let
them
be
a
state
in
the
first
place
i
knew
somebody
else
who
went
to
one
of
your
gunmart
superstore
places
just
so
he
could
experience
the
sight
of
people
putting
guns
and
ammo
into
shopping
carts
i
didnt
believe
it
myself
until
i
drove
by
one
in
vegas
last
year
interesting
strategy
posting
here
with
complaints
about
people
elsewhere
now
that
i
live
in
britain
i
can
see
how
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
perceives
you
gunnut
morons
courtesy
is
apparently
a
dead
commodity
in
the
rest
of
the
civilized
world
gun
nut
morons
indeed
the
bbc
recently
referred
to
the
american
penchant
for
pistols
automatic
weaponsetc
very
appropriately
it
was
called
a
national
eccentricity
weve
got
guns
theyve
got
a
monarch
and
an
economy
on
the
verg
of
collapse
finger
pointing
across
the
atlanticis
a
waste
or
time
the
only
problem
is
that
canada
i
hear
is
suffering
from
your
national
eccentricity
in
that
easy
to
purchase
weapons
are
being
smuggled
cross
the
border
canada
has
been
blaming
the
us
for
their
problems
for
years
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is
this
ten
years
ago
they
crowed
about
how
great
their
system
was
because
theyd
gotten
rid
of
the
guns
and
the
us
would
be
so
much
better
if
theyd
just
get
into
the
divine
light
shining
from
the
north
we
pointed
out
that
it
was
cultural
differences
and
pointed
to
their
precontrol
crime
rates
we
also
pointed
out
that
the
history
of
the
entire
world
contained
smuggling
and
that
whenever
something
was
wanted
it
was
smuggled
in
if
the
problem
were
based
on
us
guns
it
would
have
surfaced
years
before
now
more
canadian
criminals
want
guns
and
they
are
being
provided
canada
has
its
own
version
of
the
drug
problem
yet
drugs
are
prohibited
in
the
us
hell
here
in
britain
the
cops
dont
even
carry
guns
thats
another
funny
thing
you
see
a
us
border
guard
and
hes
got
his
or
on
his
belt
with
tons
o
spare
ammo
never
know
maybe
some
canadian
shopper
might
get
out
of
hand
hell
as
i
recall
in
peoples
court
even
rusty
carried
a
gun
never
know
some
plaintiff
might
go
nuts
saw
a
news
report
out
of
britain
that
armed
crime
is
on
the
rise
and
several
police
agencies
are
considering
have
permanent
firearms
officers
to
deal
with
it
according
to
us
news
world
report
british
handgun
deaths
have
risen
over
over
the
past
twelve
years
the
us
number
has
dropped
maybe
theyre
smuggling
them
across
the
usuk
border
yeah
thats
the
ticket
cya
have
a
nice
day
