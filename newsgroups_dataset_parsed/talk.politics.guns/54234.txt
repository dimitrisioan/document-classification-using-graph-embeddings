THINGS
THAT
I
HAVENT
CONSIDERED
AS
I
AM
NOT
REALLY
FAMILIAR
ENOUGH
WITH

SOME
POLICE
DEPARTMENTS
SWITCHED
TO
GLOCKS
AND
THEN
STARTED
QUIETLY
SWITCHING
MANY
OFFICERS
BACK
TO
THE
OLD

TOO
MANY
WERE
HAVING
ACCIDENTS
PARTLY
DUE
TO
THE
POOR
TRAINING
THEY
RECEIVED
NOT
THAT
GLOCKS
REQUIRE
ROCKET
SCIENTISTS
BUT
SOME
COPS
ARE
BAFFLED
BY
SOMETHING
AS
COMPLEX
AS

A
REAL

TOO
GREAT
