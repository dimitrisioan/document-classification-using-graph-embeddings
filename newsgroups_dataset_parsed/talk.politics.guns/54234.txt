all
your
points
are
very
well
taken
and
things
that
i
havent
considered
as
i
am
not
really
familiar
enough
with
handguns
some
police
departments
switched
to
glocks
and
then
started
quietly
switching
many
officers
back
to
the
old
revolvers
too
many
were
having
accidents
partly
due
to
the
poor
training
they
received
not
that
glocks
require
rocket
scientists
but
some
cops
are
baffled
by
something
as
complex
as
the
timer
on
a
vcr
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
ahem
hrumph
you
have
encurred
the
wrath
of
glock
owners
we
will
beat
you
with
our
hammers
oooops
dont
have
any
seriously
there
is
no
difference
in
the
safeties
betweena
glock
and
any
da
revolver
intellectually
think
of
the
glock
as
a
very
high
cap
revolver
ignoring
stove
pipes
misfeeds
and
all
the
other
bonus
exercises
that
autoloaders
give
you
that
is
every
gun
has
its
safe
moment
and
its
dangerous
moment
if
you
just
learn
how
to
handle
it
it
becomes
a
lot
less
dangerous
to
you
