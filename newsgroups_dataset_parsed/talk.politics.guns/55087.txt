no
you
were
right
the
first
time
law
enforcement
agencies
should
keep
his
opinions
in
mind
before
breaking
into
or
assaulting
anybodys
house
ok
let
me
correct
my
unfortunate
choice
of
words
i
just
hope
that
the
law
enforcement
agencies
keep
your
attitude
in
mind
the
next
time
your
wife
is
gangraped
by
a
bunch
of
juvenile
drugdealing
thugs
while
she
was
jogging
in
the
park
no
strike
that
etc
the
batf
came
out
with
horse
trailers
men
ninja
uniforms
machine
guns
and
stun
grenades
and
used
them
before
koresh
could
even
look
at
the
warrant
koresh
fought
back
and
people
died
the
key
part
of
this
sentense
is
koresh
fought
back
this
was
his
big
mistake
when
the
police
decide
to
exert
their
authority
over
you
you
dont
fight
back
unless
you
want
people
to
get
hurt
you
cease
all
resistance
and
signal
your
submission
to
their
authority
the
cops
they
are
the
boss
you
are
the
subject
the
concept
of
defense
against
illegal
action
under
color
of
law
is
kaput
no
longer
is
it
government
of
the
people
by
the
people
its
government
of
the
people
by
the
biggest
guns
the
idea
of
sorting
it
out
in
court
later
is
fine
but
one
has
to
get
to
court
in
one
piece
to
do
that
korash
had
good
reason
to
think
that
he
was
not
going
to
get
that
chance
see
below
arent
in
it
to
beat
up
and
kill
people
in
spite
of
the
actions
of
a
few
bad
apples
if
you
quit
resisting
they
quit
hitting
perhaps
the
batf
did
over
react
to
the
threat
posed
by
koresh
perhaps
they
did
use
too
much
force
ok
fine
im
willing
to
concede
to
that
point
if
sufficient
proof
is
produced
and
i
admit
that
there
is
some
evidence
to
indicate
this
however
resisting
the
batf
is
the
worst
thing
koresh
could
have
done
if
they
hadnt
resisted
there
is
a
good
chance
that
no
one
would
have
been
hurt
remeber
they
were
using
stun
grenades
not
antipersonnel
grenades
if
the
bds
were
not
in
violation
of
any
rember
korash
didnt
get
to
sort
this
all
out
serenely
typing
at
his
keyboard
he
heard
some
kind
of
explosives
go
off
he
saw
he
was
being
attacked
with
no
overt
action
from
him
yet
he
could
no
more
say
oh
its
ok
its
only
stun
grenades
anymore
than
i
could
he
slammed
the
door
at
that
point
and
proceeded
to
repel
the
attackers
he
felt
in
genuine
fear
of
his
life
i
know
i
would
be
in
fear
of
my
life
at
that
point
have
you
ever
been
shot
at
how
clear
and
logically
could
you
think
under
that
pressure
when
you
might
have
all
of
or
seconds
to
evaluate
what
is
going
on
and
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
that
law
enforcements
intended
to
bring
in
their
suspect
horizontally
for
all
we
know
he
was
informed
by
someone
saying
something
like
hey
guy
the
batf
is
coming
like
gangbusters
and
they
mean
to
waste
you
according
to
the
latest
news
the
released
warrant
so
we
are
told
said
the
reason
for
this
ww
iii
raid
was
that
korashs
group
had
spent
around
on
firearms
and
related
stuff
over
an
undetermined
period
now
even
assuming
that
the
figure
isnt
calculated
like
the
feds
do
a
drug
siezure
for
people
that
isnt
really
all
that
much
you
priced
decent
guns
lately
hell
i
can
think
of
a
person
right
now
that
probably
has
that
much
for
one
individual
mostly
machineguns
sure
he
is
an
avid
collector
but
unless
a
new
law
has
been
passed
it
is
not
illegal
nor
an
indication
of
anything
illegal
to
have
a
lot
of
guns
also
note
that
the
warrant
had
nothing
to
say
about
machine
guns
so
what
is
the
justification
of
this
cowboy
raid
other
than
a
romp
gone
bad
for
some
antigun
media
hype
to
support
clintons
push
for
disarming
the
unconnected
citizen
of
any
and
all
effective
defensive
weapons
this
administration
has
only
one
thing
in
mind
control
people
control
whether
it
is
gun
control
clinton
cripple
chip
national
smart
id
cards
it
all
boils
down
to
people
control
can
you
say
only
years
late
i
knew
you
could
laws
they
would
have
been
released
as
they
had
been
before
if
this
had
happened
and
it
turned
out
that
the
batf
had
used
too
much
force
then
the
bds
would
have
grounds
for
a
law
suit
and
for
federal
charges
of
civil
rights
violations
sounds
a
lot
like
la
huh
dont
take
that
wrong
im
not
commenting
one
way
or
the
other
about
the
rodney
king
case
but
thats
not
what
they
wanted
they
got
tipped
off
that
the
batf
was
on
the
way
in
and
rather
than
adopting
a
nonviolent
nonthreatening
posture
to
greet
the
batf
they
decided
to
fight
and
batf
knew
the
bds
were
expecting
them
via
minutes
report
but
they
decided
they
were
so
big
so
bad
they
would
have
a
cakewalk
at
the
bds
expense
for
a
nice
media
show
anyway
but
it
all
turned
to
shit
and
the
fbi
taking
over
to
manage
things
we
see
it
all
turned
to
shit
too
clinton
says
i
am
taking
full
responsibility
bah
responsibility
means
to
take
the
repercussions
if
it
goes
wrong
bet
you
nobody
pays
any
serious
repercussions
responsibility
only
has
meaning
as
media
pr
or
as
a
means
to
corner
the
average
joe
schmoe
figure
it
out
clinton
reno
the
fbi
and
batf
will
all
be
immune
can
you
say
whitewash
ive
said
enough
of
this
issue
im
probably
not
going
to
convince
any
of
you
folks
and
youre
certainly
not
going
to
convince
me
ive
got
work
to
do
don
be
very
afraid
of
our
government
in
the
land
of
the
free
and
if
you
decide
all
this
is
acceptable
get
even
more
afraid
especially
when
it
is
you
they
decide
for
some
reason
they
dislike
when
they
no
longer
feel
the
need
to
confine
their
cowboy
tactics

kooks
