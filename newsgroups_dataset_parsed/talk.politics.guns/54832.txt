RE
GUNS
IN
BACKCOUNTRY
NO
THANKS
HI
IN
CANADA
ANY
GUN
THAT
ENTERS
A
NATIONAL
PARK
MUST
BE
SEALED
I
THINK
ITS
A
SMALL
METAL
TAG
THATS
PLACED
OVER
THE
TRIGGER
THE
NET
RESULT
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
YOU
CANT
USE
A
GUN
TO
PROTECT
YOURSELF
FROM
BEARS
OR
PSYCHOS
IN
THE
NATIONAL
PARKS
INSTEAD
ONE
HAS
TO
BE
SENSITIVE
TO
THE
DANGERS
AND
ANNOYANCES
OF
HIKING
IN
BEAR
COUNTRY
AND
TAKE
THE
APPROPRIATE
PRECAUTIONS
I
THINK
THIS
POLICY
MAKES
THE
USERS
OF
THE
NATIONAL
PARKS
FEEL
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
TO
NATURE
THAT
THEY
ARE
A
PART
OF
NATURE
AND
AS
SUCH
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
NATURE
ON
ITS
OWN
TERMS
