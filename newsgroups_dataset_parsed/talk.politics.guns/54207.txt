RE
WHAT
TO
DO
IF
YOU
SHOOT
SOMEBODY
IN
ARTICLE
DAVID
VEAL
SAYS
IN
ARTICLE
JASON
KRATZ
I
HAVE
HEARD
MANY
OPINIONS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
AND
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
MORE
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
NET
SAY
YOURE
IN
A
SITUATION
WHERE
YOU
HAVE
TO
PULL
A
GUN
ON
SOMEBODY
YOU
GIVE
THEM
A
CHANCE
TO
GET
AWAY
BUT
THEY
DECIDED
TO
CONTINUE
IN
THEIR
ACTION
ANYWAY
AND
YOU
END
UP
SHOOTING
AND
KILLING
THEM
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
SHOULD
YOU
STAY
AND
WAIT
FOR
THE
COPS
OR
SHOULD
YOU
COLLECT
YOUR
BRASS
IF
YOURE
USING
A
SEMIAUTO
AND
GET
OUT
OF
THERE
PROVIDED
OF
COURSE
YOU
DONT
THINK
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
SEEN
AS
A
DATA
POINT
FROM
TENNESSEE
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
AND
A
POLICE
OFFICER
ESSENTIALLY
RECOMMENDS
THAT
IF
YOU
CAN
FADE
AWAY
EVEN
IF
YOU
WERE
PERFECTLY
JUSTIFIED
YOURE
LIKELY
IN
FOR
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
HASSLE
A
SIDE
NOTE
CARRYING
A
GUN
CONCEALED
IS
A
MISDEMEANOR
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
HAVE
HEARD
BEFORE
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
FADE
AWAY
AND
NOBODY
SAW
YOU
WHAT
KIND
OF
EVIDENCE
WOULD
THEY
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
TO
CATCH
YOU
THIS
IS
ASSUMING
THAT
YOU
EITHER
COLLECTED
YOUR
BRASS
OR
HAD
A
REVOLVER
WHAT
KIND
OF
LAWS
ARE
ON
THE
BOOKS
REGARDING
THIS
TYPE
OF
SITUATION
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
MOST
LIKELY
THING
TO
HAPPEN
TO
YOU
IF
YOU
STAYED
AND
WAITED
AND
IT
WAS
A
FIRST
OFFENSE
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
YOU
TOOK
OFF
BUT
SOMEONE
SAW
YOU
AND
YOU
WERE
CAUGHT
ITS
ONE
OF
THOSE
BY
STATE
THINGS
PRETTY
MUCH
GUESS
ITS
TIME
TO
TAKE
A
TRIP
TO
THE
LIBRARY
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
ILLINOIS
STATUTES
AGAIN
JUST
FOR
THE
RECORD
FOLKS
IM
JUST
ASKING
THIS
BECAUSE
IM
CURIOUS
IM
JUST
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
READ
MORE
ON
STUFF
LIKE
