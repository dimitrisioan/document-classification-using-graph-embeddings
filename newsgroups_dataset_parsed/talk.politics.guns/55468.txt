posting
with
the
exception
of
these
particular
lines
i
hope
you
dont
really
think
that
your
average
drug
dealer
actually
purchases
his
guns
from
a
legal
source
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
it
there
were
several
shootings
recently
in
which
the
guns
had
been
purchased
at
the
baltimore
gunsmith
on
broadway
a
favorite
place
to
get
cheap
popular
pieces
by

i
am
referring
to
the
kinds
of
guns
our
local
youth
gangs
like
pistol
grip
shotguns
cheap
magnums
and
i
hate
to
poke
a
hole
in
your
bubble
but
i
was
referring
to
a
specific
gunstore
and
specific
incidents
any
other
questions
