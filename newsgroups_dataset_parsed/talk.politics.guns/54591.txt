I
THINK
ILL
QUOTE
THE
BBC
QUOTING
ACTUALLY
VOICE
INTERVIEW
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
BRITISH
SURVIVORS
HE
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
FIRE
STARTED
WHEN
THE
TANKS
CAUSED
AN
INTERNAL
WOODEN
WALLROOF
TO
COLLAPSE
KNOCKING
OVER
KEROSENE
LAMPS
AND
THAT
THEY
HAD
NO
SUICIDE
PLAN
IF
THE
FBI
STARTED
THE
FIRE
WHY
DIDNT
PEOPLE
FLEE
THE
BURNING
BUILDING
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
WAS
UNIMPORTANT
AS
TO
WHO

THEORY
ONE
CULT
MEMBER
SAID
THAT
SHE
WISHED
THAT
SHE
HAD
BEEN
THERE
AND
THAT
NOW
SHE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
WAIT
FOR
VERNON
TO
RETURN
FOR
THEM
SHE
ACTUALLY
SEEMED
UPSET
THAT
SHE
DID
NOT
BURN
WITH
THEM
WHILE
I
THINK
THAT
VERNON
STARTED
THE
FIRE
HIS
FOLLOWERS
ANYWAY
IT
IS
INCIDENTAL

THEIR
REACTION
