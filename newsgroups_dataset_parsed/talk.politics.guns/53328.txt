i
dont
know
how
anyone
can
state
that
gun
control
could
have
no
effect
on
homicide
rates
there
were
over
accidental
handgun
homicides
in
america
in
most
with
licensed
weapons
more
american
children
accidentally
shot
other
children
last
year
than
all
the
handgun
homicides
in
great
britain
source
national
safety
council
please
no
dictionary
arguments
about
rates
vs
total
numbers
okay
theyre
offered
for
emphasis
not
comparison
youre
a
great
debater
you
chose
your
sources
of
information
claim
them
to
be
superior
ive
made
no
such
claim
please
direct
my
attention
towards
any
posting
of
mine
where
i
claimed
superior
sources
of
information
its
probably
because
i
bothered
to
post
any
references
at
all
while
others
seem
content
to
post
numbers
pulled
from
the
ozone
that
youve
confused
it
with
facttwisting
if
so
i
apologize
then
take
those
twisted
numbers
and
twist
them
further
by
trying
well
then
heres
fair
opportunity
for
you
to
prove
that
ive
twisted
numbers
on
what
grounds
do
you
contradict
those
references
do
you
have
any
citations
any
sources
of
your
own
that
i
can
take
similar
gratuitous
shots
at
to
compare
absolute
numbers
between
two
countries
that
have
major
population
differences
the
usa
and
gb
and
then
whine
that
you
are
afraid
someone
might
attack
your
process
and
so
claim
the
numbers
are
for
emphasis
not
comparison
emphasis
of
what
nitpicking
and
scolding
is
a
whiney
debating
style
jim
anything
else
is
blowing
