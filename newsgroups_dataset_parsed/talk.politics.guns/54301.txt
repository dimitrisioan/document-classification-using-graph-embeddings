RE
AX
THE
ATF
TRUE
CONGRESS
HAS
SAID
THAT
POSSESION
OF
AN
UNLICENSED
AUTOMATIC
WEAPON
IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
THE
LAW
CONGRESS
DID
NOT
HOWEVER
SAY
THAT
SUCH
POSSESION
WAS
A
CAPITAL
OFFENSE
OR
A
TRANSGRESSION
WORTH
GETTING
FOUR
GOOD
GOVERNMENT
AGENTS
KILLED
AND
OTHERS
WOUNDED
EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
A
CAPITAL
OFFENSE
THE
WARRANT
WAS
NOT
EVEN
AN
ARREST
WARRANT
BUT
A
SEARCH
WARRANT
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THERE
WAS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
ILLEGAL
ARMS
JUST
ENOUGH
OF
A
SUGGESTION
TO
GET
A
JUDGE
TO
SIGN
A
LICENSE
TO
SEARCH
FOR
ILLEGAL
EVIDENCE
QUESTION
AS
IN
THE
RODNEY
KING
CASE
WILL
THE
US
DOJ
INSTITUTE
CRIMINAL
CIVIL
RIGHTS
PROCEEDINGS
AGAINST
THE
BATF
OR
AT
LEAST
AN
INVESTIGATION
OK
SORRY
I
ASKED
