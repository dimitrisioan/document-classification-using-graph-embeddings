DAVID

WRITES
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
CARD
IS
BULL
IN
AND
OF
ITS
SELF
BUT
IM
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
DO
THEY
PLAN
ON
MAKING
IT
A
REQUIREMENT
TO
ALWAYS
HAVE
IT
ON
YOU
OR
IS
IT
ONLY
GOING
TO
BE
REQUIRED
TO
BE
PRESENTED
WHEN
TRYING
TO
GE
MEDICAL
AID
THIS
AT
LEAST
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
DETERMINED
THE
BLUE
CROSS
MEDICAL
COVERAGE
FOR
ALL
FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES
IS
A
GOOD
MODEL
FOR
A
FUTURE
NATIONAL
SYSTEM
TO
GET
EMERGENCY
MEDICAL
CARE
ANYONE
SO
INSURED
MUST
ALWAYS
CARRY
THEIR
BLUE
CROSS
CARD
BEFORE
ENTERING
A
HOSPITAL
YOU
MUST
NOTIFY
BLUE
CROSS
OR
THEY
WILL
REFUSE
TO
PAY
YOUR
BILLS
IN
AN
EMERGENCY
WHERE
YOU
MUST
BE
TREATED
BEFORE
NOTIFYING
THEM
YOU
MUST
INFORM
THEM
WITHIN
HOURS
OR
IF
YOU
ARE
UNABLE
TO
DO
SO
FOR
MEDICAL
REASONS
THE
HOSPITAL
MUST
FAILING
TO
DO
SO
WITHIN
HOURS
MEANS
THEY
WILL
NOT
COVER
THE
HOSPITALIZATION
IN
YOU
NEED
YOUR
CARD
TO
NOTIFY
THEM
AND
WITHOUT
THE
CARD
THE
HOSPITAL
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
KNOW
THEY
HAD
TO
THEREFORE
YOU
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
CARRY
THE
CARD
AT
ALL
TIMES
OR
DO
WITHOUT
EMERGENCY
MEDICAL
COVERAGE
