RE
GUN
CONTROL
WAS
RE
WERE
MAD
AS
HELL
AT
THE
TV
NEWS
IN
ARTICLE
MANESMAGPIELINKNETCOM
STEVE
MANES
WRITES
THATS
ALL
VERY
WELL
AND
GOOD
BUT
I
WAS
REFERING
TO
ALL
HOMOCIDES
NOT
JUST
ONES
INVOLVING
HANDGUNS
WHAT
IS
THIS
FIXATION
ON
DEATH
BY
SHOOTING
AS
IF
IT
WERE
SOMEHOW
WORSE
THAN
DEATH
BY
STABBING
WHAT
RELEVANCE
ARE
ALL
HOMICIDES
IN
THIS
DEBATE
THE
ISSUE
IS
GUNS
NOT
BASEBALL
BATS
NO
THE
ISSUE
IS
REDUCING
CRIME
NOT
GUNS
IF
GUN
CONTROL
DOESNT
LOWER
CRIME
OVERALL
THEN
IS
DOESNT
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUE
EVEN
A
SIMPLETON
KNOWS
THAT
HE
STANDS
A
BETTER
CHANCE
OF
SURVIVING
AN
ATTACK
WITH
A
BASEBALL
BAT
DOES
THAT
MATTER
IF
ASSAULTS
WITH
A
BASEBALL
BAT
BECOME
MUCH
MORE
COMMON
MUGGERS
USING
A
GUN
RELY
PRIMARILY
ON
THE
THREAT
OF
THE
GUN
AND
RARELY
SHOOT
THEIR
VICTIM
A
MUGGER
USING
A
KNIFE
IS
MUCH
MORE
LIKELY
TO
START
BY
STABBING
HIS
VICTIM
IN
AN
EFFORT
INCAPACITATE
HIM
SO
WHILE
A
KNIF
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
DEADLY
AS
A
GUN
CRIMINALS
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
ACTUALLY
USE
THE
KNIFE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THREATENING
THE
VICTIM
WITH
IT
IT
ISNT
AT
ALL
CLEAR
THAT
REPLACING
THE
CRIMINALS
GUN
WITH
A
KNIFE
WOULD
REDUCE
MURDERS
STABBINGS
MIGHT
JUST
BECOME
MORE
COMMON
THATS
WHY
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
OVERALL
NOT
THE
WITHGUN
HOMICIDE
RATE
IT
AVOIDS
THE
ISSUE
OF
SUBSTITUTION
DIFFERENT
CRIMINAL
TECHINQUES
OF
USING
DIFFERENT
WEAPONS
ETC
AND
MEASURES
WHAT
WE
WANT
TO
PREVENT
MURDERS
AS
FOR
KNIVES
SEE
MY
EARLIER
POST
ID
MUCH
RATHER
FACE
A
KNIFE
THAN
A
GUN
THANKS
FACE
POSSIBLY
HOWEVER
FACING
KNIFEWELDING
ATTACKERS
ISNT
TOO
COMMON
STABBING
WITHOUT
WARNING
AND
BY
SUPPRISE
IS
THE
USUAL
TACTIC
VERY
FEW
CRIMINALS
SHOOT
FROM
COVER
IT
ATTRACTS
TO
MUCH
ATTENTION
AND
THEY
DONT
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
GO
THROUGH
YOUR
POCKETS
OVERALL
ID
MUCH
RATHER
BE
THREATENED
WITH
A
GUN
THAN
ACTUALLY
STABBED
WITH
A
KNIFE
FORTUNATELY
THE
BEST
DEFENSE
AGAINST
A
KNIFE
ISNT
ANOTHER
KNIFE
ANYONE
TRAINED
IN
UNARMED
SELFDEFENSE
WONT
HAVE
MUCH
OF
A
PROBLEM
DISARMING
A
KNIFE
ASSAILANT
UNTRAINED
IN
KNIFE
ASSAULT
WHICH
PROBABLY
MEANS
OF
KNIFE
ASSAILANTS
ACTUALLY
THE
EXACT
SAME
STATEMENT
IS
TRUE
OF
GUNS
TRAINING
IN
UNARMED
SELFDEFENCE
WILL
LET
YOU
DISARM
AN
UNTRAINED
GUNMAN
WITHOUT
MUCH
PROBLEM
YOU
ALSO
IGNORE
THE
CRIMINALS
REACTION
THE
NATIONAL
CRIME
SURVEY
CLEARLY
SHOWS
THAT
CRIMINALS
UNARMED
ARMED
WITH
A
KNIFE
GUN
OR
WHATEVER
ARE
UNWILLING
TO
RISK
THEIR
LIVES
IN
A
CONFRONTATION
IF
FACED
WITH
A
SERIOUS
THREAT
ALMOST
ALL
PREFER
TO
LEAVE
AND
FIND
AN
EASIER
TARGET
THEREFORE
USING
OR
THREATENING
TO
USE
AS
IS
MUCH
MORE
COMMONLY
THE
CASE
A
WEAPON
IS
THE
BEST
DEFENCE
AGAINST
AN
ATTACKER
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
HE
IS
ARMED
KNIVES
HOWEVER
ARE
MUCH
LESS
EFFECTIVE
THAN
GUNS
CRIMINALS
DONT
CONSIDER
KNIFES
AS
A
SERIOUS
THREAT
NEARLY
AS
OFTEN
AS
THEY
DO
GUNS
