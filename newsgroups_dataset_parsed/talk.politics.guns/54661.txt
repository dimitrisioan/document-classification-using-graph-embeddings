LICENSES
SHOULD

I
AM
NOT
A

BUT
THESE
IDEAS
COULD
CERTAINLY
BE
A
BASIS
FOR
DEFINITIONS
I
HOPE
YOU
REALIZE
HOW
TRIVIAL
IT
IS
TO
MANUFACTURE
THESE
COMPOUNDS
GIVEN
ABOUT
IN
LAB
EQUIPMENT
AND
CHEMICALS
WHICH
ARE
COMMERCIALLY
AVAILABLE
AND
GIVEN
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
I
HAVE
GRADUATING
BS
CH
I
COULD
SYNTHESIZE
ENOUGH
OF
THESE
COMPOUNDS
TO
MAKE
A
SERIOUS
DENT
IN
THE
POPULATION
OF
SEVERAL
MAJOR
US
CITIES
AS
ALSO
NOTED
THE
KNOWLEDGE
IS
THERE
FOR
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
ITS
NOT
EVEN
THAT
RESTRICTED
THE
ONLY
THING
IS
THE
EXPENSE
NOW
IM
NOT
GOING
AROUND
MAKING
THESE
THINGS
BUT
ITS
NOT

OF
ANY
LAW
I
SIMPLY
DONT
GET
ANY
MARGINAL
BENEFIT
OUT
OF
KILLING
ANYONE
ANY
LAW
YOU
ENACT
IN
THIS
RESPECT
IS
ONLY
GOING
TO
GIVE
YOU
THE
ABILITY
TO
ADD
A
CHARGE
AGAINST
SOMEONE
WHO
DOES
MAKE
AND
USE
SAID
WEAPONS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
CHEMICAL
AGENTS
I
SERIOUSLY
DOUBT
THAT
YOU
WOULD
EVEN
KNOW
THAT
SOMEONE
HAD
SET
UP
A

UNTIL
AFTER
THE

HAD
BEEN
USED
PART
OF

IS
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
PRECURSORS
TO
CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
SUCH
AS
GB
AND
SARIN
ETC
IS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
VERY
VALID
COMMERCIAL
USES
AND
IT
IS
VERY
EASY
TO
DIVERT
