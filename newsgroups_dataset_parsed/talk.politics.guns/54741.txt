RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE
THOMAS
PARSLI
THOMASPIFIUIONO
WRITES
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE
FIGURES
EXACTLY
BUT
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
DEATHS
IN
TEXAS
IN
THAT
WAS
CAUSED
BY
GUNS
HOW
ABOUT
FIREARM
RELATED
THIS
IS
MORE
THAN
THOSE
BEEING
KILLED
IN
CARACCIDENTS
TEXAS
IS
UNUSUAL
IN
THIS
REGARD
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
REDUCE
THEM
BOTH
THOUGH
AS
TEXAS
DOESNT
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
AN
MURDER
RATE
THAT
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
THE
NATIONAL
AVERAGE
I
WOULD
EXPECT
IT
IS
A
RESULT
OF
A
MUCH
HIGHER
SUICIDE
RATE
I
SHOULD
NOT
SUFFER
BECAUSE
OF
OTHERS
BE
NICE
IF
YOU
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
SUFFER
AT
ALL
WE
ALL
AGREE
ON
THIS
ONE
BUT
WE
ALSO
LIVE
IN
A
SOCIATY
AND
THEREFOR
WELL
HAVE
TO
GIVE
UP
SOME
OF
OUR
FREEDOM
NOTE
THE
HERES
WHERE
WE
RUN
INTO
A
PROBLEM
I
AM
PERFECTLY
WILLING
TO
HAVE
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
ON
SOMETHING
WHICH
IS
LIKELY
TO
CAUSE
OTHERS
HARM
WHAT
WERE
DISCUSSING
THOUGH
IS
THE
EXTREME
REGULATION
OF
A
LARGE
GROUP
IN
ORDER
TO
TARGET
A
SMALL
GROUP
AND
I
DONT
THINK
THATS
APPROPRIATE
DO
YOU
HAVE
AN
INSURANCE
THEN
YOULL
HAVE
TO
PAY
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
OTHERS
DO
DO
YOU
BUY
ANYTHING
YOU
ARE
PAYING
FOR
THOSE
WHO
RETURN
GOODS
STEAL
OR
EVEN
THOSE
WHO
GETS
A
BONUS
DO
YOU
LIVE
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLE
THEN
YOU
CANT
DO
ERERYTHING
YOUD
WANT
BURPINGFARTING
PLAYING
MUSIC
LOUD
DOES
THIS
THEN
JUSTIFY
ANYTHING
AT
SOME
POINT
YOU
HAVE
TO
DRAW
A
LINE
AT
LEAST
TO
MY
WAY
OF
THINKING
WHERE
THE
GOVERNMENT
MUST
HAVE
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
MORE
SUBSTANTIAL
THAN
A
SET
OF
PERCENTAGES
WITH
WHICH
TO
PUNISH
AN
INDIVIDUAL
WHERE
DO
YOU
DRAW
THE
LINE
OR
IS
THERE
ONE
ONE
STATE
DONT
REMEMBER
WHICH
TEXAS
TRIED
TO
IMPOSE
A
RULE
THAT
YOU
COULD
ONLY
BUY
ONE
GUN
EACH
MONTH
THINK
YOU
ALL
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
VIRGINIA
IT
PASSED
I
RESPECT
THE
RIGHT
TO
DEFEND
YOURSELF
BUT
THAT
RIGHT
SHOULD
NOT
INFLICT
ON
OTHER
PEOPLE
DOES
IT
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
YOU
ALL
REALIZE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
IN
AMERICA
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
YOU
WONT
TAKE
THE
CAR
AWAY
FROM
THE
DRUNK
DRIVER
YOU
HOPE
TO
CURE
HIM
FIRST
CUTE
ANALOGY
THE
US
DOESNT
TREAT
DRUNK
DRIVING
LIKE
A
SERIOUS
CRIME
HOWEVER
WE
ALSO
DONT
CONFISCATE
CARS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
DRINK
WE
ALSO
DONT
CONFISCATE
ALL
CARS
BECAUSE
SOME
PEOPLE
DRINK
AND
DRIVE
ITS
THE
CORE
OF
THE
LEGAL
SYSTEM
THAT
IN
ORDER
TO
PUNISH
AN
INDIVIDUAL
AND
ID
CALL
PROPERTY
CONFISCATION
A
PUNISHMENT
YOU
MUST
HAVE
EVIDENCE
AGAINST
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
THAT
IS
IT
ISNT
ENOUGH
TO
SHOW
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
CONVICTED
OF
MURDER
ARE
WHITE
IN
ORDER
TO
CONVICT
A
PARTICULAR
WHITE
