I
TEND
TO
AGREE
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
A
BETTER
EXPLANATION
OF
WHY
THE
FBI
STOPPED
THE
FIRETRUCKS
AT
THE
GATE
I
SAW
THIS
IN
REALTIME
IT
CONCERNS
ME
THAT
THE
FBI
APPEARED
TO
NOT
BE
TOO
INTERESTED
IN
STOPPING
THE
FIRE
AFTER
IT
STARTED
AND
ACTUALLY
STARTED
FLYING
HUEYS
AROUND
THE

WHICH
HAD
TO
ADD
IN
SOME
SMALL
PART
TO
THE
