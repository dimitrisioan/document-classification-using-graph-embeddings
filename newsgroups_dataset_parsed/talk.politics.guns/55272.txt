everyone
discussing
why
the
batf
did
this
or
didnt
do
that
is
missing
the
point
batf
wanted
to
destroy
koresh
everything
they
did
was
consistent
with
that
objective
and
having
done
that
theyve
declared
victory
by
flying
their
flag
over
the
ruins
regardless
of
who
started
the
firefight
or
fire
i
see
the
flag
as
nothing
but
arrogant
not
only
arrogant
but
in
plain
bad
taste
as
though
they
had
defeated
a
difficult
foe
and
done
so
with
honor
i
understand
reno
does
not
own
the
batf
doesnt
bentsen
a
texas
boy
at
that
i
believe
why
is
not
bentsen
from
treasury
as
much
out
front
as
reno
is
is
he
hiding
behind
her
apron
strings
the
batf
got
sat
on
pretty
early
on
after
the
initial
shooting
was
over
it
pretty
much
become
the
fbis
show
even
that
batf
guy
stopped
showing
up
next
to
the
speaker
at
the
daily
press
conferences

of
tennessee
division

i
still
remember
the
way
you
laughed
when
you
pushed
me
down
the
elevator
shaft
sometimes
i
get
to
thinking
you
dont
love
me
anymore
