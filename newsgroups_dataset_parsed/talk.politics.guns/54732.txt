says
how
do
we
know
that
they
were
gang
members
and
not
undercover
cops
or
even
lawabiding
menacing
minorities
btw
why
the
sneer
quotes
we
know
because
the
area
that
the
gun
shopshooting
range
is
in
is
right
on
the
border
of
the
west
side
of
chicago
that
is
a
gang
infested
area
so
kratz
was
there
does
that
mean
that
hes
a
gang
member
even
in
the
most
ganginfested
areas
most
of
the
residents
are
not
gangmembers
that
only
minorities
have
gangs
not
so
as
far
as
the
quotes
are
concerned
it
was
totally
obvious
that
they
werent
just
practicing
for
marksmanship
how
was
it
obvious
were
they
not
trying
to
hit
the
target
or
does
kratz
confuse
marksmanship
with
trying
to
simulate
a
post
if
so
that
excludes
selfdefense
shooting
but
the
rest
of
us
understand
that
that
exclusion
would
be
an
error
it
excludes
a
lot
of
legit
gun
games
as
well
dont
know
about
you
but
i
have
never
seen
anyone
else
practice
marksmanship
by
taking
their
gun
out
of
their
coat
as
fast
as
possible
and
start
shooting
sounds
like
practical
pistol
or
maybe
ipsc
it
also
sounds
like
how
a
selfdefense
shooter
might
well
practice
the
only
things
that
action
excludes
are
hunting
and
like
a
post
shooting
kratz
should
get
out
more
often
