RE
MY
REPLY
TO
NY
TIMES
EDITORIAL
DEAR
MEMBER
OF
THE
NRA
IN
JOHN
KIM
WRITES
AS
A
LEGAL
GUN
OWNER
I
MUST
DISAGREE
EVEN
WHEN
I
DONT
SEE
EYE
TOEYE
WITH
THE
NRA
ON
A
PARTICULAR
ISSUE
THEY
ARE
THE
ONLY
NATIONAL
GROUP
WHICH
HAS
EFFECTIVELY
FOUGHT
FOR
MY
RIGHTS
TO
TARGET
SHOOT
HUNT
AND
PROTECT
MYSELF
FROM
DANGEROUS
CRIMINALS
ONE
MORE
TIME
IT
AINT
ABOUT
DUCK
HUNTING
IT
AINT
ABOUT
LONE
PERPS
ON
LONELY
STREETS
ITS
ABOUT
DEFENDING
OUR
RIGHTS
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
WHICH
HAS
SEEN
FIT
TO
IGNORE
HISTORY
AND
ATTEMPT
ONCE
AGAIN
TO
TAKE
THEM
FROM
US
THEY
WILL
SUCCEED
IF
WE
DONT
DO
SOMETHING
NOW
THATS
WHY
I
THINK
THE
NRA
IS
A
BUNCH
OF
WEENIES
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
FORGOTTEN
THAT
FUNDAMENTAL
FACT
PARDON
ALL
MY
SHOUTING
BUT
THERE
SEEM
TO
BE
A
WHOLE
HELLUVA
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
ON
CONDITION
WHITE
FAT
DUMB
AND
HAPPY
SUCKING
THAT
GLASS
TEAT
FOR
ALL
THEYRE
WORTH
WAKE
UP
AND
SMELL
THE
CORDITE
GANG
THEYRE
SHOOTING
AT
US
AND
ITS
HIGH
TIME
WE
SHOT
BACK
AT
LEAST
WITH
OUR
KEYBOARDS
MY
TWO
BITS
GLENN
R
STONE
GLENNSEASGATECHEDU
FLY
YOUR
FLAGS
AT
HALF
STAFF
AND
UPSIDE
DOWN
TO
MOURN
AND
PROTEST
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
BOR
