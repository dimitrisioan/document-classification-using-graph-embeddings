fanatics
willing

believe
whatever
that
government
wants
to
tell
them
without
any

they
sure
get
shrill

your
sweeping
generalizations
evince
your
own
ignorance
what
were
they
supposed
to
do
just
let
him
be
yes
given
the
history
of
the
bds
and
the
fact
that
they
were
just
peacefully
minding
their
own
business
i
think
this
would
have
been
the
correct
course
of
action
in
the
very
beginning
everything
that
followed
was
a
direct
result
of
the
major

fuckup
that
the

just
over

fuck

fuck
the

yep
no

about

they
should
have
just
bombed
those

right
from

yeah
sure
so
much
for
any
resemblence
to
an
america
that
abides
by
the

so
much
for
feeling
safe
in
your
home
so
much
for
any
of
the
rights
enumerated
in
the
bill
of

being
upheld
why
bother
they
just
get
in
the
way
of
an
effective
government
that
is
a
government
of
the
elite
by
the
elite
for
the

joe
attitudes
like
yours
frighten
me
you
have
very
few
facts
about
what
actually
happened
and
what
information
you
do
have
came
from
a
single

the

you
are
more
