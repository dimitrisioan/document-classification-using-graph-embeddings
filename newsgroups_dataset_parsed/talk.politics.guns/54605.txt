btw
if
i
screwed
up
bad
enough
to
get
someone
hurtkilled
my
co
the
pms
probably
the
brigade
commander
and
possibly
the
region
commander
could
all
expect
a
good
amount
of
heat
possibly
including
reassignment
or
seperationfrom
service
certainly
the
pms
would
not
be
promotable
and
would
shortly
thereafter
be
asked
to
retire
this
is
called
accountability
if
my
pms
knew
beforehand
about
the
activities
in
which
a
person
was
killed
he
would
be
nailed
for
failing
to
ensure
that
proper
safety
measures
were
taken
if
he
didnt
know
he
would
be
nailed
for
improper
supervision
can
we
hold
the
president
of
the
us
to
lower
standards
than
his
subordinates
after
all
he
was
briefed
on
the
fbi
raid
he
could
have
asked
how
they
intended
to
flush
the
bds
out
the
president
is
not
competent
to
plan
or
judge
the
planning
of
such
a
raid
nor
does
he
need
to
be
his
job
is
to
set
basic
policies
and
manage
the
people
under
him
if
clinton
instructed
reno
to
preserve
lives
and
if
she
confirmed
that
the
plan
for
the
raid
was
a
safe
as
could
be
then
he
did
his
job
the
president
should
not
involve
himself
in
the
minor
details
of
these
kinds
of
operations
this
sort
of
micromanagement
only
leads
to
disaster
as
was
demonstrated
so
well
in
vietnam
but
the
raid
went
bad
over
civilians
have
been
killed
in
a
controntation
with
us
authorities
now
clinton
enters
the
picture
in
a
big
way
will
clinton
start
an
investigation
or
will
he
try
to
squash
any
attempt
to
investigate
is
he
a
responsible
leader
or
is
he
only
interested
in
protecting
the
image
of
his
administration
well
all
find

this
unfolds
