ADVERTISEMENTS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TRADERS
IS
CLAIMING
BUT
IT
APPEARS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
OAKLAND
TRIBUNE
HAS
CENSORED
GUN
ADS
IN
THE
PAST
LIKEWISE
FOR
THE
SAN
FRANCISCO
CHRONICLE
AND
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
GUN
AD
IN
THE
SAN
FRANCISCO
EXAMINER
SPECIFICALLY
ABOUT
A
YEAR
AGO
ON
THURSDAYS
WHEN
TRADERS
PLACED
ITS
ADS
THE
CHRON
AD
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
ANY
GRAPHICS
REPRESENTING
ANY
HANDGUN
SALE
THOUGH
TEXT
COULD
LIST
IT
THE
TRIB
WOULD
RUN
A
GRAPHIC
OF
A
HANDGUN
THE
EXAMINER
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
A
TRADERS

AT
ALL
OVER
THE
PAST
YEAR
WHILE
OAKLAND
POLITICIANS
HAVE
MADE
A
LOT
OF
NOISE
ABOUT
MEASURES
TO
FIGHT
CRIME
THE
TRIB
STOPPED
TAKING
THE
TRADERS

THEN
STARTED
PUBLISHING
IT
BUT
WITHOUT
ANY
HANDGUN
GRAPHIC
THEN
STOPPED
THEN
STARTED
SINCE
THE

NOT
HAD
