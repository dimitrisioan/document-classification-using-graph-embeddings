ADRIAN
NAME
CHANGED

THE

AND

HOUSE
DEAR
ADRIAN
IM
WAY
BEHIND
SCHEDULE
ON
MY
CURRENT
BOOK
AGAIN
SO
THIS
REPLY
TO
YOUR
NOTE
CRITICIZING
THE
RECENT
MAGAZINE
INTERVIEW
I
GAVE
AND
GENERALLY
ATTACKING
GUN
OWNERSHIP
WILL
NECESSARILY
CONSIST
MOSTLY
OF
ASSERTIONS
YOURE
FREE
TO
BELIEVE
OR
NOT
I
CAN
BACK
WITH
EVIDENCE
AND
LOGIC
IVE
NEITHER
TIME
NOR
ENERGY
TO
PRESENT
NOW
IVE
WRITTEN
FULLY
ON
THIS
TOPIC
BEFORE
AND
WILL
AGAIN
IN
THE
FUTURE
WHEN
I
DO
ILL
MAKE
SURE
YOU
GET
COPIES
THERE
ARE
MANY
ARGUMENTS
I
MIGHT
MAKE
FROM
THE
FUTILITY
AND
DANGER
OF
DELEGATING
SELFDEFENSE
TO
THE
POLICE
SEE
DON
KATES
IN
THE
JAN
WALL
STREET
JOURNAL
TO
THE
REAL
EFFECT
OF
PROHIBITION
SHIFTING
CONSUMERS
FROM
NEWLYOUTLAWED
HANDGUNS
OR
SEMIAUTOMATIC
RIFLES
TO
ITEMS
LIKE
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUNS
OR
HOMEMADE
BOMBS
BUT
ILL
LIMIT
MYSELF
HERE
TO
COMMENTING
ON
THE
NEWSPAPER
CLIPPING
YOU
SENT
WITH
YOUR
NOTE
FIRST
THE
FREEDOM
TO
OWN
AND
CARRY
THE
WEAPON
OF
YOUR
CHOICE

AND
INALIENABLE

CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT
SUBJECT
NEITHER
TO
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
NOR
TO
ARGUMENTS
GROUNDED
IN
SOCIAL
UTILITY
SECOND
PUBLICATION
OF
SOME
LATTERDAY
SCIENTIFIC
STUDY
DOESNT
ALTER
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
GUN
PROHIBITIONISTS
I
DISCUSSED
IN
MY
INTERVIEW
ANNOYING
YOU
SO
MUCH
IN
THE
PROCESS
WERE
LYING

THE
FREEDOM

NEITHER
TO
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
NOR
TO
ARGUMENTS
GROUNDED
IN
SOCIAL
UTILITY
FOURTH
AS
OFTEN
HAPPENS
WITH
THESE
THINGS
THE
STUDY
DOESNT
SUPPORT
THE
GUN
PROHIBITIONISTS
ORIGINAL
NUMERICAL
CONTENTIONS
ANYWAY
BUT
SIMPLY
ADDS
A
NEW
LAYER
OF
SPURIOUS
CLAIMS
TO
AN
OLDER

OF
LIES
OMISSIONS
AND
DISTORTIONS

SIXTH
THE
FACT
THAT

PROHIBITIONISTS
HAVE
BEEN
CAUGHT

ON
COUNTLESS
OCCASIONS
CARL
BAKAL
AUTHOR
OF
NO
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
EVEN
CONFESSED
TO
IT
PUBLICLY
MAKES
THE
VALUE
OF
THIS
PRESENT
STUDY
DUBIOUS
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
SEVENTH
THE
FREEDOM
TO
OWN
AND
CARRY
THE
WEAPON
OF
YOUR
CHOICE
IS
A
NATURAL
FUNDAMENTAL
AND
INALIENABLE

RIGHT
SUBJECT
NEITHER
TO

PROCESS
NOR

ARGUMENTS
GROUNDED
IN
SOCIAL
UTILITY
EIGHTH
GIVEN
YOUR
OWN
LIFELONG
SERVICE
AS
A
FEDERAL
BUREAUCRAT
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
CYNICAL
SOPHISTICATION
OF
YOUR
FICTION
YOU
SHOULD
BE
BETTER
AWARE
THAN
MOST
PEOPLE
HOW
PROGRESS
IN
DESIGNING
STUDIES
TO
PROVE
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
OUTSTRIPS
OUR
ABILITY
TO
COLLECT
MEANINGFUL
DATA
A
CASE
IN
POINT
WE
MIGHT
AGREE
ON
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
TOOK
ANOTHER
KIND
OF
PROHIBITIONIST
OR
YEARS
TO
CREATE
STUDIES
PROVING
THAT
PORNOGRAPHY
CAUSES
CRIME
MORE
NAIVE
AND
PROBABLY
MORE
HONEST
EFFORTS
IN
THE
AND
CLEARLY
INDICATE
THE
CONTRARY
NINTH
THE
FREEDOM
TO
OWN
AND
CARRY
THE
WEAPON
OF
YOUR
CHOICE
IS
A
NATURAL
FUNDAMENTAL
AND
INALIENABLE
HUMAN
INDIVIDUAL
CIVIL
AND
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT
SUBJECT
NEITHER
TO
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
NOR
TO
ARGUMENTS
GROUNDED
IN
SOCIAL
UTILITY
TENTH
ANOTHER
REASON
TO
DOUBT
ALL
SUCH
STUDIES
IS
THAT
HUMAN
BEHAVIOR
AS
THE
AUSTRIAN
SCHOOL
OF
ECONOMICS
DEMONSTRATES
IS
FAR
TOO
COMPLEX
AND
UNPREDICTABLE
TO
BE
MEANINGFULLY
QUANTIFIED
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
DO
SO
AND
THEN
CREATE
PUBLIC
POLICY
BASED
ON
THE
RESULTING
PSEUDOINFORMATION
IS
WRECKING
OUR
CIVILIZATION
ELEVENTH
THE
FREEDOM
TO
OWN
AND
CARRY
THE
WEAPON
OF
YOUR
CHOICE
IS
A
NATURAL
FUNDAMENTAL
AND
INALIENABLE

INDIVIDUAL
CIVIL
AND
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT
SUBJECT
NEITHER
TO
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
NOR
TO
ARGUMENTS
GROUNDED
IN
SOCIAL
UTILITY
TWELFTH
THE
STUDY
IS
ALSO
WORTHLESS
BECAUSE
IT
INCORPORATES
FIGURES
FOR
SUICIDE
WHICH
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
A
TRAGEDY
BUT
BASICALLY
ANOTHER
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHT
SOMETIMES
WITH
ANCILLARY
SOCIAL
BENEFITS
IF
ANYTHING
PERHAPS
SUICIDE
INTERVENTION
SHOULD
BE
A
CRIMINAL
OFFENSE
THIRTEENTH
AND
FINALLY
THE
NATIONAL
RIFLE
ASSOCIATION
OFFICIALS
QUOTED
IN
THE
ARTICLE
WHATEVER
THEIR
SHORTCOMINGS
AND
THEY
ARE
MANY
ARE
CORRECT
IN
THIS
INSTANCE
THE
STUDY
IS
MEANINGLESS
BECAUSE
THE
FREEDOM
TO
OWN
AND
CARRY
THE
WEAPON
OF
YOUR
CHOICE
IS
A
NATURAL
FUNDAMENTAL
AND
INALIENABLE
HUMAN
INDIVIDUAL
CIVIL
AND
CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT
SUBJECT
NEITHER
TO
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS
NOR
TO
ARGUMENTS
GROUNDED
IN
SOCIAL
UTILITY
AND
BECAUSE
OF
THAT
ADRIAN
EVEN
IF
THE
STUDY
WERE
VALID
IT
WOULDNT
DETER
ME
FROM
A
LIFELONG
PERSONAL
OBJECTIVE
OF
SEEING
THAT
ANYONE
CAN
OWN
ANY
WEAPON
HE
OR
SHE
PREFERS
AND
CARRY
IT
HOWEVER
WHENEVER
AND
WHEREVER
HE
OR
SHE
DESIRES
WITHOUT
ASKING
ANYBODYS
PERMISSION
IN
THIS
IM
ABLY
ASSISTED
BY
GUN
PROHIBITIONISTS
THEMSELVES
WHOSE
YAWPING
INVARIABLY
MOVES
PREVIOUSLY
UNARMED
PEOPLE
TO
GO
OUT
AND
BUY
THEIR
FIRST
GUN
WHILE
THEY
STILL
CAN
BEFORE
THE
GUN
CONTROL
ACT
MOST
OF
THE
SHOOTING
FRATERNITY
VIEWED
HANDGUNS
INCORRECTLY
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT
AS
INACCURATE
INEFFECTIVE
TOYS
THERE
PROBABLY
WERENT
SIX
MILLION
OF
THEM
IN
THE
WHOLE
COUNTRY
NOW
THANKS
TO
KENNEDY
METZENBAUM
THE
BRADYS
AND
THEIR
ILK
AMERICAS
GREATEST
SPORTING
GOODS
SALES
TEAM
WE
PROBABLY
MANUFACTURE
AT
LEAST
THAT
MANY
EVERY
YEAR
THE
FASCINATING
DATUM
IS
THAT
HANDGUN
CONTROL
ET
AL
ARE
PERFECTLY
AWARE
OF
THIS
SO
I
GUESS
YOULL
HAVE
TO
ASK
THEM
YOURSELF
WHAT
THEIR
REAL
MOTIVES
ARE
LOOK
GUNMAKING
ISNT
AN
ARCANE
OR
DIFFICULT
ART
AND
BY
THE
WAY
ITS
EASIER
TO
MAKE
A
FULLY
AUTOMATIC
WEAPON
THAN
A
SEMIAUTOMATIC
THE
FACT
THAT
I
CAN
STILL
OBTAIN
MY
OWN
WEAPON
OF
PREFERENCE
THE
SELFLOADING
PISTOL
IS
THE
ONLY
THING
WHICH
KEEPS
ME
FROM
PURSUING
THIS
FURTHER
EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
DIFFICULT
THERE
ARE
ALREADY
A
QUARTER
BILLION
FIREARMS
IN
AMERICA
WITH
AN
ESTIMATED
HALF
LIFE
OF
YEARS
POSSIBLY
MORE
FOR
STAINLESS
STEEL
GUNS
ARE
GONNA
BE
AROUND
A
LONG
TIME
ADRIAN
WHETHER
YOU
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
AS
FOR
ME
TO
PARAPHRASE
ELMER
KEITH
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
THE
LAW
PROVIDES
OR
ANY
COURT
DECIDES
IM
ALWAYS
GOING
TO
BE
ARMED
AND
I
WILL
ALWAYS
WORK
TO
SEE
THAT
OTHERS
ARE
AS
WELL
THE
BAD
NEWS
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
THOUSANDS
MORE
PERHAPS
EVEN
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
WHERE
I
COME
FROM
WE
CANT
BE
STOPPED
BY
PASSING
LAWS
WE
CAN
ONLY
BE
FORCED
TO
ARM
OURSELVES
AND
OTHERS
SECRETLY
AND
GIVEN
BOTH
THE
PRACTICAL
AND
ALLEGED
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
FULL
AUTOMATICS
AND
SEMIAUTOMATICS
PERHAPS
MORE
EFFICIENTLY
