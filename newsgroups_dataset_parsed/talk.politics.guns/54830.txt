the
special
agents
attempting
to
serve
the
federal
search
warrant
were
all
dressed
in
apparel
clearly
identified
with
the
letters
atf
and
a
highly
visible
policetype
badge
additionally
the
special
agents
announced
who
they
were
and
their
purpose
for
being
at
the
compound
immediately
following
this
announcement
gunfire
erupted
from
the
compound
resulting
in
the
deaths
of
four
atf
special
agents
and
the
wounding
of
several
others
through
no
fault
of
atf
the
element
of
surprise
was
lost
which
caused
the
tragedy
this
statement
simply
amazes
me
through
no
fault
of
atf
the
element
of
surprise
was
lost
what
element
of
surprise
in
the
paragraph
preceding
this
one
he
said
the
special
agents
announced
who
they
were
and
their
purpose
for
being
at
the
compound
which
was
to
serve
the
federal
warrant
no
element
of
surprise
was
even
needed
for
that
no
the
element
of
surprise
that
they
lost
was
that
needed
for
a
preemptive
first
strike
without
warning
inasmuch
as
the
warrants
remain
sealed
by
a
us
magistrate
and
the
investigation
remains
in
an
active
ongoung
status
we
are
prohibited
from
disclosing
any
further
information
at
this
time
read
they
need
to
wait
until
they
see
how
it
comes
out
before
they
fabricate
anymore
which
could
get
disproven
we
hope
we
have
been
responsive
to
your

let
us
