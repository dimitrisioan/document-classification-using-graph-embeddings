my
response
is
so
what
is
mr
rutledge
arguing
that
since
the
local
and
federal
governments
have
abandoned
their
charter
to
support
such
activity
and
passed
laws
prohibiting
private
organizations
from
doing
so
that
they
have
eliminated
the
basis
for
the
rkba
on
the
contrary
to
anyone
who
understands
the
game
they
have
strengthened
it
no
i
originally
argued
that
the
second
amendment
was
a
little
bit
and
an
anachronism
these
prohibiting
laws
are
examples
why
the
are
an
anachronism
after
all
laws
in
made
by
representatives
of
the
people
these
representatives
of
the
people
have
already
decided
that
the
second
amendment
does
not
apply
or
is
too
broad
in
some
cases
since
these
representatives
feel
an
unconditional
interpretation
is
not
wanted
then
it
is
probable
that
they
majority
of
the
people
feel
the
same
way
if
this
is
so
it
is
an
example
of
the
people
using
their
power
of
government
if
this
is
not
how
the
people
feel
the
people
should
stand
up
and
state
their
wishes
ill
point
out
that
the
whole
point
of
the
difficult
amendment
process
was
to
require
a
supermajority
to
change
the
supreme
law
making
it
impossible
for
a
majority
of
the
people
to
simply
change
the
law
on
a
whim
simply
changing
the
meaning
based
on
the
representatives
of
the
people
effectively
destroys
the
amendment
process
the
states
you
know
are
also
entitled
to
a
say
under
that
process
mox
nix
mr
rutledge
you
are
the
only
one
here
claiming
that
the
rkba
is
dependent
on
the
existence
of
a
topflight
wellregulated
militia
why
this
is
a
false
assumption
has
already
been
posted
a
number
of
times
no
i
simple
stated
that
the
people
have
a
right
to
join
a
well
organized
militia
ill
note
that
that
right
could
be
considered
protected
under
the
first
amendments
protection
of
peaceful
assembly
unless
you
would
consider
a
militia
inherently
nonpeaceful
then
theyve
stated
the
same
thing
twice
