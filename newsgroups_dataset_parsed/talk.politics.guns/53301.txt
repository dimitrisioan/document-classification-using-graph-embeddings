MR
NICE
GUY
WRITES
BOTH
THE
GUN
NUTS
AND
THE
GAYS
ARE
AGGRESSIVELY
DEFENSIVE
AND
QUITE
HOSTILE
TO
ANY
ONE
TRYING
TO
DEPRIVE
THEM
OF
THEIR
RIGHTS
JUST
LIKE
ANY
GROUP
TRYING
TO
PROTECT
THEIR
RIGHTS
THE
FALLACY
OF
THIS
WHOLE
THING
IS
THAT
YOUR
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
IN
JEAPARDY
BY
THESE
POSTS
HOW
CAN
YOU
SAY
THAT
I
PRESUME
THAT
YOU
MEAN
THAT
TALKING
ABOUT
RESTRICTING
RIGHTS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
RESTRICTING
THOSE
RIGHTS
WELL
ARGUING
FOR
THOSE
RESTRICTIONS
MAY
LEAD
TO
IMPLEMENTATION
MUCH
THE
SAME
WAY
AS
ASSAULT
CAN
LEAD
TO
BATTERY
LEGAL
DEFINITIONS
MOST
TPG
PEOPLE
AND
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
GROUPS
WONT
EVEN
DISCUSS
THE
SUBJECT
AT
ALL
IN
A
POLITE
FORM
THE
MERE
RAISING
OF
A
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHY
THE
RIGHTS
ARE
THERE
OR
WHAT
EXACTLY
THE
RIGHT
ENCOMPASSES
BRING
SHRILL

AND
ANGRYHOSTILE
TRAFFIC
WELL
I
CANT
SPEAK
FOR
THE
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
IVE
SEEN
ALOT
OF
POLITE
DISCUSSION
ON
TPG
PLEASE
EVERYONE
DONT
TAKE
THIS
GUYS
WORD
OR
MINE
FOR
THAT
MATTER
ON
IT
READ
TPG
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
TRY
TO
DETERMINE
FROM
WHICH
DIRECTION
MOST
OF
THE
FLAMEAGE
ORIGINATES
IF
YOU
POST
WITHOUT
FLAMEBAIT
YOU
WILL
GENERALLY
RECEIVE
REASONED
RESPONSES
TRUE
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
TEND
TO
LOSE
THEIR
TEMPERS
QUICKLY
AS
THERE
ARE
ON
ALL
NEWSGROUPS
BUT
THEY
REALLY
DO
FEEL
THEIR
RIGHTS
ARE
IN
JEOPARDY
OH
AND
NEAT
TRICK
TALKING
DERISIVELY
ABOUT
ANOTHER
NEWSGROUP
WHILE
NOT
CROSSPOSTING
TO
ALLOW
THEM
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
I
THINK
A
LOT
OF
TPG
PEOPLE
HAVE
VERY
THIN
SKIN
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
DISCUSSING
THESE
SUBJECTS
METHINKS
YOU
