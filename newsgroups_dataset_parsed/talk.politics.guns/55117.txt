all
paranoid
freaks
this
was
no
move
fuckup
a
helicoptor
was
thermalimaging
the
compound
that
afternoon
and
detected
three
fires
erupting
almost
simultaneously
did
anyone
notice
any
helicopters
equipped
with
thermal
imaging
equipment
they
usually
manifest
themselves
in
a
turret
in
the
front
of
the
helo
or
a
sphere
on
top
of
the
rotor
with
optical
elements
i
didnt
notice
any
or
other
helos
equipped
as
such
did
they
use
handheld
military
thermal
scanners
if
so
there
is
no
recording
capability
and
hence
the
credibility
of
the
report
is
subject
to
human
error
