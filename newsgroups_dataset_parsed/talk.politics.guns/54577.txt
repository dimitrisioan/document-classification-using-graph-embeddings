the
last
few
days
the
batf
and
the
fbi
are
both
federal
agencies
clinton
has
admitted
in
front
of
news
cameras
that
janet
reno
the
once
and
future
attorney
general
gave
him
a
full
briefing
of
what
was
planned
before
they
did
it
and
he
gave
her
the
go
ahead
maybe
just
possibly
that
makes
him
a
teensy
bit
responsible
perhaps
youve
been
under
a
rock
since
say
the
turn
of
the
century
how
in
the
is
one
man
supposed
to
review
every
single
freaking
governmental
action
every
day
thats
why
we
have
an
executive
branch
he
reviewed
the
plan
and
said
go
but
he
wasnt
the
architect
and
he
wasnt
there
bullhorn
in
hand
implementing
it
yes
he
was
responsible
in
the
sense
that
he
was
briefed
so
what
shit
happens
that
sounds
like
a
callous
way
to
dismiss
the
deaths
of
people
but
i
cant
understand
why
people
get
so
bent
about
the
accidental
deathsuicide
which
is
it
could
take
months
of
some
total
fucking
sociopathchild
molester
and
his
crazed
followers
while
opposing
us
intervention
in
bosnia
just
like
billy
boy
said
i
think
some
of
you
people
have
too
much
time
on
your
hands
and
screwed
up
priorities
