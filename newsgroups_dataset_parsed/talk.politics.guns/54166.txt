trim
your
articles
what
about
guns
with
nonlethal
bullets
like
rubber
or
plastic
bullets
would
those
work
very
well
in
stopping
an
attack
last
i
heard
nonlethal
was
a
bit
of
a
misnomer
for
these
things
also
you
need
to
consider
our
legal
system
since
any
of
these
things
can
be
lethal
you
are
going
to
have
a
hard
time
explaining
why
you
applied
lethal
force
when
you
didnt
think
it
was
necessary
if
you
thought
lethal
force
was
necessary
you
wouldnt
be
using
rubber
bullets
would
you
ouch
if
you
are
justified
in
shooting
them
at
all
you
are
justified
in
using
the
best
self
defense
ammunition
you
can
get
your
hands
on
it
might
actually
improve
the
legal
outcome
this
is
why
hollow
points
hold
up
in
court
they
are
safer
for
you
safer
for
innocent
by
standers
dont
as
a
rule
go
through
the
perp
and
actually
safer
for
the
perp
if
you
are
using
military
hard
ball
you
may
have
to
shoot
him
many
times
where
one
or
two
hollow
points
might
stop
him
and
do
the
job
as
a
rule
the
fewer
wound
channels
the
better
the
chance
for
his
surviving
the
incident
