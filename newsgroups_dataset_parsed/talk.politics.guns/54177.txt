theres
only
one
way
i
know
of
to
tell
an
from
an
pick
it
up
hold
it
about
a
foot
from
your
face
and
look
closely
at
the
saftey
lever
if
it
has
two
positions
its
an
if
it
has
three
its
an
there
are
numerous
internal
differences
as
well
but
since
one
would
have
to
field
strip
the
weapon
to
see
them
they
are
not
valid
in
this
discussion
so
in
conclusion
there
is
very
little
external
differences
to
distinguish
an
from
an
except
at
close
very
close
range
