QUESTIONS
FOLKS
ITS
TIME
TO
START
BUILDING
SOME
PRECISE
QUESTIONS
TO
SEND
TO
OUR
FEDERAL
ELECTED
OFFICIALS
AND
TO
INVESTIGATIVE
REPORTERS
IN
OUR
LOCAL
TV
RADIO
AND
NEWPRINT
MEDIA
IDEALLY
THESE
QUESTIONS
COULD
BE
ASKED
AT
ANY
INVESTIGATION
INTO
THE
BATFS
AND
FBIS
PARTICIPATION
AT
THE
WACO
FIASCO
IN
HOPES
OF
BEING
RESOLVED
AND
HOPEFULLY
WAKE
UP
THE
LOCAL
NEWS
MEDIA
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
GETTING
THE
ENTIRE
TRUTH
FROM
THE
BATF
AND
FBI
MY
LIST
IS
UP
TO
THAT
ARE
REALLY
NAGGING
AT
MY
GUT
THE
LIST
WILL
PROBABLY
GROW
WHAT
WERE
THE
CONTENTS
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
WARRANT
NOW
SEALED
THAT
THE
BATF
OBTAINED
IT
IS
REASONABLE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ILLEGAL
FIREARMS
ANDOR
AMMUNITION
COULD
NOT
BE
FLUSHED
DOWN
THE
TOILET
THEREFORE
A
NOKNOCK
RAID
COULD
BE
RULED
OUT
PRIOR
TO
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
ON
THE
COMPLEX
DID
A
SINGLE
BATF
AGENT
AND
ACCOMPANYING

WITHOUT
A
CONTINGENT
OF

AND

MEDIA
PERSONNEL
ATTEMPT
TO
KNOCK
ON
THE

OF
THE

DAVIDIANS
COMPLEX
AND
SERVE
THE

IN
A
MANNER
PRESCRIBED
BY
LAW
ON
THE
DAY
OF
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
ON
THE
COMPLEX
BATF
AGENTS
WERE
AWARE
THAT
SEVERAL
SMALL
CHILDREN
WERE
INSIDE
THE

IN
THE

GUN
BATTLE
BATF

FIRED
INTO
A
BUILDING
KNOWN
TO
CONTAIN
CHILDREN
KILLING
AT

ONE
TWOYEAR
OLD
CHILD
KNOWING
CHILDREN
WERE
PRESENT
WHY
DIDNT
THE
BATF
HAVE
AN
ALTERNATE
PLAN
AND
IMMEDIATELY
RETREAT
FROM
THE
AREA
CLOSE
TO
THE
COMPLEX
AND
IMPLEMENT
THE
ALTERNATE
PLAN
RATHER
THAN
OPENING
FIRE
AND
JEOPARDIZING
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
CHILDREN
IN

THE

THAT

INDICATES
THAT
DAVID

DOES
THIS

OF
THE

SHOW
BATF
AGENTS
ARMED
WITH
AND
RIFLES
ALTHOUGH
UNCLEAR
ON
THE

BECAUSE
OF
OBSTRUCTION
FROM
FULL
VIEW
BY

BODIES
THEY
ALSO
MAY
HAVE

WHAT
TYPES
OF
FIREARMS
DID
THE
BATF
AGENTS
HAVE
IMMEDIATE
ACCESS
TO
AT
THE
SCENE
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
ASSAULT
ON
THE
COMPLEX
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
TO
CONFIRM
ANYONE
WAS
INSIDE
THE
COMPLEX
INVOLUNTARILY
WHY
DID
THE
FBI
TREAT
IT
AS
A
HOSTAGE
SITUATION
ALONG
THE

LINES
WHY
DID
THE
FBI
USE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
WARFARE
TECHNIQUES
INCLUDING
SENSORY
OVERLOAD
SLEEP
DEPRIVATION
AND
OTHER
DISRUPTIVE
TECHNIQUES
THAT
WOULD
TEST
THE
SANITY
OF
ANY
NORMAL

RATHER
THAN
USING

AIMED
AT
PLACING
THE

OCCUPANTS
INTO
A
CALMER

REPORTS
INDICATE
SEVERAL
OF
THE
CHILDREN
INSIDE
THE

WERE
ACCOMPANIED
BY
THEIR
MOTHERS
SINCE
IT
IS
REASONABLE
TO
EXPECT
THESE
MOTHERS
WOULD
HAVE
THEIR
CHILDREN
TAKEN
AWAY
FROM
THEM
IF
THEY
CAME
OUT
WHY
DID
THE
FBI
EXPECT
THE
MOTHERS
TO
JUST
WALK
OUT
AND
SURRENDER
THEMSELVES
TO
THE
AUTHORITIES
AGENTS
AT

CLAIM
TO
HAVE
SEEN

DAVIDIAN

WHO
SURVIVED
THE
INFERNO

THE

WAS

AN

AND
KNOCKED
OVER
A
LANTERN
WHICH
WAS
SETTING
ON
A
TABLE
VIDEO
TAPE
OF
THE

DOES
SHOW
AN

VEHICLE
PUNCHING
A
HOLE
IN
THE
WALL
AND
THE
FIRE
ERUPTED
ALMOST
IMMEDIATELY
FROM
THE
SAME
GENERAL
LOCATION
WAS
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
FIRE
THE
SAME
ROOM
WHERE
THE
ARMORED
VEHICLE
PENETRATED
FBI
SPOKESMEN
ARE
VOICING
THE
OPINION
THAT
THE
DAVID
KORESH
AND
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE

DAVIDIANS
COMMITTED
MASS
SUICIDE
YET
BODIES
ARE
BEING
DISCOVERED
THROUGHOUT
THE

AND
OTHER
AREAS
WITHIN
THE

COMPLEX
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
COUNTER
TO
ANY
KNOWN

THROUGH

WHAT

DOES
THE

HAVE
THAT
A

SHOWN
ON

WAS
CAUSED
BY
THE

AMMUNITION
ANDOR
POWDER

EXPLODING
YET
THE

SEEMS
TO
BE
MORE
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
THE
TYPE
CREATED
WHEN
COMPRESSED

OR
OTHER
HIGHLY
VOLATILE
FUEL

EXPLODES
WAS
ANY

FOUND
WHICH
WOULD
INDICATE
THE

HAD
AN

EXPLODED
TO
CREATE
THIS

IF
SO
AND
IF
DAVID
KORESH
AND
MEMBERS
OF
THE

DAVIDIANS
WERE
ENGAGED
IN
THE
LEGAL
BUSINESS
OF
SELLINGBUYING
FIREARMS
WAS
THE
AMOUNT
DETERMINED
TO
BE
EXCESSIVELY
GREATER
THAN
ONE
WOULD
EXPECT
FOR
SOMEONE
ENGAGED
IN
SUCH
A
LEGAL
BUSINESS
IT
IS
RUMORED
THAT
ONE
FBI
AGENT
WAS
EXTREMELY
UPSET
ABOUT
CRITICAL
NEWS
MEDIA
COVERAGE
AND
INTENTIONALLY
USED
AN
ARMORED
VEHICLE
TO
CRUSH
A
REPORTERS
CAR
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
AT

IS
THERE
ANY
FACTUAL
BASIS
TO
THIS
RUMOR
AND
IF
SO
WHAT
CHARGES
WILL
BE
BROUGHT
AGAINST
THE
FBI
AGENT
WHO
PERFORMED
THE
ACT
FBI
DIRECTOR
SESSIONS
STATES
THAT
DURING
THE
FINAL
ASSAULT
ON
THE
COMPLEX
OVER
SHOTS
WERE
FIRED
AT
THE
VEHICLES
ON
THE
VIDEO
TAPE
OF
THE
INCIDENT
YOU
CAN
HEAR
THE
DRONE
OF
THE
ARMORED
VEHICLES
ENGINES
YET
THERE
IS
NO
SOUND
OF
THE
SHARP
REPORTS
THAT
ONE
WOULD
EXPECT
TO
HEAR
IF
SHOTS
WERE
FIRED
ALSO
THERE
ARE
NO
INDICATIONS
OF
SMOKE
ANDOR
MUZZLE
FLASHES
APPEARING
FROM
THE
WINDOWS
BUILDINGS
OR
OTHER
STRUCTURES
IN

SURELY
THESE
SHOULD
BE
EVIDENT
IF
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
HAD
FIRED
ON
THE
ARMORED
VEHICLES
FINALLY
THE
VIDEO
TAPE
DOES
NOT
SHOW
ANY
INDICATION
OF
PAINT
SPLATTER
SPARKS
OR
OTHER
CHARACTERISTIC
SPRAY
OF
MATERIAL
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
APPARENT
IF
THE

HAD
FIRED
UPON

THE

IN

IF
