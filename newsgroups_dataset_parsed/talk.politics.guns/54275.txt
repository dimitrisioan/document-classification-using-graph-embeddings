meyers
writes
a
bill
to
establish
the
right
to
obtain
firearms
for
security
and
to
use
firearms
in
defense
of
self
family
or
home
and
to
provide
for
the
enforcement
of
such
right
maybe
im
too
religious
but
when
i
see
a
bill
to
establish
a
right
i
wince
keep
in
mind
what
the
law
giveth
the
law
can

if

packet
i
dont
think
your
objection
is
beyond
the
bounds
of
rationality
the
right
mentioned
in
the
bill
is
already
established
under
the
second
amendment
the
bill
should
be
reworded
to
reaffirm
the
second
amendment
rkba
and
then
establish
the
procedures
for
redress
through
the
federal
court
system
the
right
already
exists
and
is
already
embodied
in
our
constitution
