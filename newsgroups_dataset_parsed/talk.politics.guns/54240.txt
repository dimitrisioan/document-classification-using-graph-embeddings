re
ban
all
firearms
as
quoted
from
by
ratscbnewsccbattcom
morris
the
cat
firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
all
production
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
firearms
from
scratch
highranking
crime
figures
could
obtain
imported
uzis
and
such
but
the
average
person
and
average
thug
would
be
lucky
to
get
a
zipgun
and
would
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
this
is
not
borne
out
of
reality
the
old
soviet
union
had
a
very
serious
domestic
handgun
and
submachinegun
trade
guns
that
were
of
commercial
grade
because
they
were
produced
in
honesttogoodness
machineshops
why
would
all
production
have
to
be
local
dont
we
have
a
road
system
that
is
the
envy
of
the
world
if
anybody
wanted
proof
of
the
nonsense
of
the
you
cant
build
guns
claim
they
need
look
no
farther
than
the
philippines
amateur
gunsmiths
there
regularly
produce
everything
from
automatics
to
full
auto
shotguns
now
if
this
guy
wants
to
claim
that
the
philippines
is
either
technologically
superior
to
the
us
or
that
their
transportation
is
better
than
ours
all
i
can
say
is
that
hes
living
in
a
fantasy
world
youre
like
a
bunch
of
overeducated
new
york
jewish
aclu
lawyers
fighting
to
eliminate
school
prayer
from
the
public
schools
in
arkansas
