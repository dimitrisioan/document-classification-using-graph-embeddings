writes
in
article
mgbslacvmslacstanfordedu
says
from
ap
according
to
numerous
accounts
by
those
in
the
compound
the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
oh
then
why
did
the
smoke
and
flames
start
from
three
different
places
in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
this
claim
hasnt
been
retracted
or
contradicted
yet
as
many
earlier
government
claims
have
at
least
one
clip
showed
a
fire
erupting
after
a
tank
busted
in
a
wall
we
have
unsubstantiated
claims
by
the
government
about
the
flirs
spotting
simultaneous
fires
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
thats
easy
six
hours
of
cs
gas
heavy
smoke
from
a
rapidly
spreading
fire
confusion
panic
only
got
out
the
building
was
collapsing
all
around
them
and
finding
the
way
out
was
a
matter
of
luck
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
the
davidians
may
have
committed
suicide
or
some
few
zealots
among
them
might
have
started
the
fires
that
is
possible
but
given
the
governments
earlier
inability
to
tell
a
straight
story
i
find
my
above
scenario
equally
possible
i
wait
for
some
independent
investigation
to
look
into
the
whole
thing
it
would
be
one
thing
if
the
government
spokespeople
had
been
consistent
and
forthright
throughout
keeping
the
press
far
away
and
ghettoized
in
pools
was
not
conducive
to
building
up
trust
sealing
the
warrants
was
nonoptimal
as
well
this
operation
was
out
of
control
from
the
gitgo
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the
governments
story
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
speaking
only
for
myself
i
think
bush
and
reagan
should
have
been
impeached
over
irancontra
in
i
would
probably
have
given
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
the
government
no
more
like
i
said
ill
wait
to
see
the
results
of
an
independent
investigation
if
there
is
one
before
i
choose
whom
to
believe
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
but
you
got
one
anyway
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
i
generally
vote
for
the
lesser
of
two
evils
this
last
time
it
was
the
least
of
three
evils
if
people
will
believe
that
of
any
politican
it
is
little
wonder
they
will
believe
all
of
the
factoids
being
given
out
as
fact
by
the
clintonrenofbibatf
confederation
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that
day
im
eager
to
know
it
was
a
bureaucratic
execution
out
of
control
bureaucracies
driven
by
percieved
selfinterest
and
gross
stupidity
and
does
bill
clinton
have
cooler
theme
music
than
darth
vader
how
is
he
on
diabolical
laughter
does
he
look
good
in
a
cape
these
things
must
be
investigated
you
first
clinton
is
just
another
statist
my
only
problem
with
clinton
on
this
is
that
he
is
apparently
willing
to
blindly
back
the
atf
and
fbi
so
i
propose
that
we
destroy
the
moon
neatly
solving
that
problem
your
blood
pressure
just
went
up
mark
sachs
is
disclaimer
if
psu
knew
i
had
opinions
theyd
try
to
charge
me
for
them
paul
hager

i
would
give

benefit
of
