perhaps
youve
been
under
a
rock
since
say
the
turn
of
the
century
how
in
the
is
one
man
supposed
to
review
every
single
freaking
governmental
action
every
day
thats
why
we
have
an
executive
branch
he
reviewed
the
plan
and
said
go
but
he
wasnt
the
architect
and
he
wasnt
there
bullhorn
in
hand
implementing
it
yes
he
was
responsible
in
the
sense
that
he
was
briefed
so
what
shit
happens
hey
joe
assuming
youre
old
enough
to
remember
it
how
did
you
feel
about
presidential
responsibility
every
time
reagan
said
i
dont
recall
about
his
armsforhostages
meetings
with
the
ollie
north
gang
how
did
you
feel
about
it
when
bush
said
he
was
out
of
the
loop
on
that
decision
when
he
was
right
there
in
the
thick
of
it
oh
right
he
was
responsible
in
the
sense
that
he
was
briefed
but
so
what
shit
happens
is
that
what
you
said
of
course
not
theres
more
than
a
little
difference
between
formulating
foreign
policy
and
overseeing
the
atfs
handling
of
a
scenario
involving
a
group
of
religious
fanatics
why
do
people
compare
apples
and
oranges
