weaver
trial
day
this

hi
folks
wednesday
marked
day
the
beginning
of
the
trial
opening
statements
were
given
by
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense
each
side
presenting
its
version
of
what
happenned
last
august
the
prosecution
argued
that
weaver
and
his
family
moved
to
idaho
in
anticipating
a
battle
with
the
evil
federal
government
the
prosecution
alleges
that
weaver
sold
federal
agents
sawed
off
shotguns
and
later
failed
to
appear
for
trial
despite
repeated
good
faith
efforts
to
get
weaver
to
surrender
peacefully
weaver
refused
the
shootout
erupted
when
weaver
discovered
agents
on
a
surveillance
mission
and
began
firing
according
to
the
prosecution
three
people
were
taking
an
offensive
action
against
an
fbi
helicopter
when
an
fbi
sniper
killed
vicki
weaver
the
defense
argued
that
weaver
and
his
family
moved
to
northern
idaho
in
to
practice
their
religion
in
peace
they
wanted
simply
to
be
left
alone
weaver
was
induced
by
federal
agents
to
sell
the
shortbarrelled
shotgun
and
did
not
as
the
prosecution
alleged
want
to
become
a
regular
supplier
the
defense
also
argued
that
the
federal
government
sought
to
arrest
weaver
when
he
wouldnt
become
an
informant
it
is
not
specified
explicitly
but
i
assume
that
this
is
a
reference
to
the
white
separatist
angle
of
the
story
well
know
more
as
things
develop
the
failure
to
appear
in
court
happenned
because
weaver
was
given
an
incorrect
court
date
and
then
indicted
before
that
date
the
shootout
occurred
when
federal
agent
arthur
roderick
killed
weavers
dog
that
was
in
proximity
to
weavers
son
samuel
weaver
then
fired
in
selfdefense
in
the
ensuing
battle
federal
agent
william
degan
was
killed
when
his
gun
was
later
found
there
were
cases
nearby
and
the
gun
was
on
semiautomatic
however
agents
were
near
the
body
for
an
extended
period
of
time
and
could
have
played
with
the
selectfire
this
will
have
to
be
more
fully
explained
finally
the
defense
claims
that
vicki
weaver
was
only
going
to
look
at
the
body
not
recover
of
her
son
when
she
was
cutdown
by
an
fbi
sniper
prosecution

confrontation

the
evidence
in
this
case
is
going
to
show
that
this
is
a
case
where
randy
weaver
and
kevin
harris
are
charged
with
crimes
they
didnt
commit
in
order
to
cover
crimes
that
the
government
did
commit
gerry
spence
nice
soundbite
notes
the
idaho
statesman
claims
that
weaver
supporters
heeded
a
call
from
spence
not
to
repeat
yesterdays
protests
outside
the
courthouse
however
the
local
nbc
affiliate
again
had
footage
on
the
news
with
supporters
including
tim
again
tim
claimed
he
was
a
skinhead
who
were
ordinary
working
class
people
he
also
claimed
he
was
for
white
pride
not
white
power
outside
the
courthouse
the
television
crew
had
an
impromptu
interview
with
bo
gritz
who
charged
that
the
neonazi
protestors
are
exactly
what
the
government
wants
to
smear
randy
weaver
in
an
affiliated
article
carried
in
the
idaho
statesman
about
a
dozen
lawyers
were
among
the
or
so
people
packed
into
the
courthouse
these
lawyers
were
present
to
watch
gerry
spence
in
action
and
to
perhaps
learn
something
from
him
some
tidbits
spence
flatly
told
the
jurors
that
he
and
his
son
kent
were
volunteering
their
time
to
represent
weaver
because
they
believed
in
him
spence
during
his
opening
statement
repeatedly
walked
behind
weaver
and
placed
his
hands
on
the
defendants
shoulders
weaver
broke
down
and
cried
during
the
recounting
of
his
wifes
death
and
spence
compared
the
sawed
off
shotgun
to
driving
mph
when
the
limit
was
another
good
one
