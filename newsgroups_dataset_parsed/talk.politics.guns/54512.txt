according
to
an
australian
documentary
made
in
the
year
before
the
stand
off
began
koresh
and
his
followers
all
believed
he
was
christ
koresh
had
sex
with
children
and
women
married
to
other
men
in
the
compound
these
were
the
perfect
children
resulting
from
the
great
seed
of
his
magnified
horn
exmembers
describe
him
in
ways
not
dissimilar
to
the
way
jim
jones
has
been
described
i
dont
know
how
accurate
the
documentary
was
the
documentary
interviewed
koresh
and
current
and
exmembers
the
documentary
disucussed
koreshs
christ
status
inside
the
cult
cult
brainwashing
techniques
and
unusual
sex
practices
the
leader
gets
any
he
wants
and
tells
others
when
they
can
or
cant
i
will
let
others
decide
if
using
religious
authority
to
have
sex
with
a
minor
is
technically
child
abuse
or
not
however
koresh
was
never
convicted
of
any
crimes
against
children
nor
was
the
batf
after
him
for
child
abuse
their
purview
in
this
case
is
strictly
in
firearms
violations
all
true
so
this
information
is
irrelevant
to
the
discussion
well
if
a
fire
was
deliberately
set
by
members
of
the
cult
then
the
history
and
background
of
the
cult
is
very
relevant
the
history
and
backgournd
of
the
jones
cult
was
very
important
in
understanding
what
happened
at
jonestown
not
taking
into
account
the
history
and
background
of
koreshs
cult
may
also
help
explain
why
the
fbi
and
batf
so
badly
predicted
the
reponses
they
would
get
from
inside
the
compund
nearly
every
step
of
the
way
in
this
badly
handled
affair
fbi
agents
have
to
pass
rigorous
psychological
examinations
and
background
checks
plus
those
in
charge
will
undoubtedly
have
to
explain
their
decisions
in
great
detail
to
congress
why
would
the
fbi
want
to
fulfill
koreshs
own
prophecy
those
in
charge
will
undoubtedly
have
to
explain
something
but
whether
their
answers
even
remotely
resembles
the
truth
we
may
never
know
and
who
is
left
alive
to
care
whether
the
prophecy
is
fulfilled
it
only
holds
meaning
for
the
nine
who
survived
it
is
likely
that
there
will
be
at
least
two
investigations
jd
and
congress
at
this
point
correction
the
fbi
said
that
two
of
the
cult
members
said
this
so
far
no
one
else
has
been
able
to
talk
to
them
so
when
they
talk
to
the
news
reporters
directly
and
relate
the
same
details
will
you
believe
them
if
they
confirm
the
story
i
probably
will
definitely
not
until
then
however
interesting
and
conflicting
details
are
starting
to
come
out
i
have
reverted
back
to
wait
mode
to
find
out
whether
the
fire
was
intentional
or
accidental
and
how
it
started
and
why
it
spread
so
fast
