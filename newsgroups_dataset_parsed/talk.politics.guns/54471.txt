re
ax
the
atf
a
few
comments
on
the
atfs
botched
handling
of
this
case
dan
s
and
another
one
hasnt
enyone
heard
of
a
leaders
recon
this
is
when
the
leader
of
the
assult
goes
and
looks
at
the
objective
to
see
if
anything
has
changed
that
would
affect
the
mission
even
the
freshman
cadets
here
in
rotcland
know
about
them
mostly
because
they
know
it
as
the
part
where
they
lie
on
the
cold
ground
for
an
hour
or
so
but
theyve
heard
about
it
maybe
the
atf
should
have
hired
out
to
the
local
rotc
guys
andrew
diederich
diedericspotcoloradoedu
these
opinions
are
only
mine
on
alternate
tuesdays
