THINK
STEINER
SAYS
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
SAY
YOURE
IN
A
SITUATION
WHERE
YOU
HAVE
TO
PULL
A
GUN
ON
SOMEBODY
YOU
GIVE
THEM
A
CHANCE
TO
GET
AWAY
BUT
THEY
DECIDED
TO
CONTINUE
IN
THEIR
ACTION
ANYWAY
AND
YOU
END
UP
SHOOTING
AND
KILLING
THEM
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
SHOULD
YOU
STAY
AND
WAIT
FOR
THE
COPS
OR
SHOULD
YOU
COLLECT
YOUR
BRASS
IF
YOURE
USING
A
SEMIAUTO
AND
GET
OUT
OF
THERE
PROVIDED
OF
COURSE
YOU
DONT
THINK
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
SEEN
WHAT
KIND
OF
LAWS
ARE
ON
THE
BOOKS
REGARDING
THIS
TYPE
OF
SITUATION
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
MOST
LIKELY
THING
TO
HAPPEN
TO
YOU
IF
YOU
STAYED
AND
WAITED
AND
IT
WAS
A
FIRST
OFFENSE
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
YOU
TOOK
OFF
BUT
SOMEONE
SAW
YOU
AND
YOU
WERE
CAUGHT
GHODS
DO
YOU
HAVE
ANY
IDEA
HOW
MUCH
TROUBLE
YOUD
GET
INTO
FOR
TAKING
OFF
LIKE
THAT
LEAVING
THE
SCENE
OF
AN
AUTO
ACCIDENT
IS
BAD
ENOUGH
KILLING
SOMEONE
LEAVING
IS
TIMES
WORSE
WHOS
GOING
TO
SERIOUSLY
BELIEVE
IT
WAS
SELFDEFENSE
WHEN
YOU
TOOK
THE
TIME
TO
COLLECT
YOUR
SPENT
CASINGS
BUT
OFFICER
I
RELOAD
WELL
LIKE
SOMEONE
SAID
IN
A
REPLY
TO
THIS
IT
REALLY
ALL
DEPENDS
ON
THE
AREA
THAT
YOU
LIVE
IN
SEE

VEALS
REPLY
TO
THIS
I
HAVE
HEARD
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
THING
THAT
HE
SAID
IN
HIS
REPLY
TO
FADE
AWAY
IF
YOU
THINK
THAT
YOU
HAVENT
BEEN
SEEN
I
HEARD
THIS
FROM
A
POLICE
OFFICER
FOR
THE
RECORD
THOUGH
HE
WAS
TALKING
ABOUT
IN
TENNESSEE
NOT
EVERYWHERE
EVEN
IF
YOU
COULD
GET
AWAY
WITH
IT
