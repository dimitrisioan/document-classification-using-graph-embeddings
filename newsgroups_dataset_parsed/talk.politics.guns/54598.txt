WRITES
YOU
DIDNT
EVEN
GET
THE
CAPITALIZATION
CORRECT
TRY
READING
USCA
ON
THE
CONSTITUTION
OR
GET
ANY
OTHER
CORRECT
VERSION
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
THIS
IS
REALLY
STUPID
NITPICKING
CAPITALIZATION
RULES
IN
THE
LATE
CENTURY
WERE
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
TODAY
AND
WHAT
WAS
POSTED
MATCHES
CURRENT
CAPITALIZATION
RULES
PETE
ZAKEL
IS
RIGHT
WE
DONT
NEED
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
CAPITALIZATION
RULES
AFTER
ALL
THE
PUNCTUATION
GIVES
ALL
THE
NECESSARY
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
SENTENCE
STRUCTURE
WHY
SHOULD
ANYONE
WORRY
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
TEXT
IS
AS
CLOSE
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
AS
POSSIBLE
SARCASM
INTENDED
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
CONSTITUTION
MILITIA
ARMS
ETC
WERE
CAPITALIZED
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
NOUNS
THIS
IS
ALSO
DONE
CURRENTLY
IN
GERMAN
THERE
IS
NO
SPECIAL
SIGNIFICANCE
TO
THESE
WORDS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
CAPITALIZED
THE
CAPITALIZATION
DENOTES
NO
SPECIAL
EMPHASIS
THEN
YOU
DIDNT
UNDERSTAND
MY
GRUMBLE
AGAIN
I
SAID
TO
GET
A
CORRECT
VERSION
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
THE
FIRST
INDICATOR
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
IE
THE
COPY
HAS
BEEN
MODERNIZED
IS
THE
MODERN
CAPITALIZATION
RULES
THE
NEXT
THING
TO
GO
IS
THE
SPELLING
AND
THEN
IVE
EVEN
SEEN
VERSIONS
WHERE
THE
GRAMMAR
WAS
MODERNIZED
OH
BUT
DONT
WORRY
MODERNIZING
THE
GRAMMAR
WONT
CHANGE
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
TEXT
RIGHT
PS
I
HAVE
FOUND
ABOUT
DIFFERENT
VERSIONS
OF
THE
CONSTITUTION
ON
THE
NETWORK
AND
ACCURACY
DOES
MATTER
