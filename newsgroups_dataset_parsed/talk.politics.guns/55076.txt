NO
KORESH
IS
RESPONSIBLE
IF
A
MURDERER
GOES
ON
THE
RAMPAGE
IT
IS
THE
MURDERER
WHO
IS
RESPONSIBLE
THE
POLICE
MAY
BEAR
RESPONSIBLITY
FOR
FAILING
TO
STOP
HIM
BUT
THE
PRIMARY
RESPONSIBILITY
IS
WITH
THE
MURDERER
WHEN
DID
KORESH
GO
ON
A
RAMPAGE
WHAT
I
SAW
WAS
AN
UNNECESSARY
UNPROVOKED
MASSIVE
ATTACK
ON
FEB
PROBABLY
EVEN
AN
ILLEGAL
ACTION
BY
ATF
CERTAINLY
WAY
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
TO
ANYTHING
REASONABLE
AND
YET
ACCORDING
TO
A
POLE
TAKEN
YESTERDAY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
POLED
BELIEVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
FORCES
ACTED
APPROPRIATELY
THEY
DONT
BELIEVE
RENO
OR
THE
PRESIDENT
HAVE
ANY
GUILT
IN
ORDERINGALLOWING
THE
ATTACK
I
SUPPOSE
THEY
ALSO
BELIEVED
THINGS
LIKE
I
WOULD
PRESENT
A
PLAN
TO
BALANCE
THE
BUDGET
WE
DONT
NEED
TO
LEAD
WITH
A
TAX
INCREASE
IT
STARTS
WITH
A
MIDDLECLASS
TAX
CUT
ILL
HAVE
THE
BILLS
READY
THE
DAY
AFTER
I
AM
INAUGURATED
AND
WELL
HAVE
A
DAY
PERIODIT
WILL
BE
THE
MOST
PRODUCTIVE
IN
MODERN
HISTORY
I
WILL
ASK
CONGRESS
FOR
A
LINE
ITEM
VETO
I
WILL
LIFT
THE
SOCIAL
SECURITY
EARNINGS
TEST
I
PERSONALLY
PREFER
TO
DISBELIEVE
THE
GOVERNMENT
UNTIL
THEY
PROVE
THEMSELVES
RIGHT
RATHER
THAN
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
THAT
WAY
I
HAVE
A
BETTER
THAN
CHANCE
OF
BEING
RIGHT
ABOUT
MY
FIRST
GUESS
READ
THE
CONSTITUTION
SOMETIME
IT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
PROTECT
THE
CITIZENS
AND
THEIR
RIGHTS
I
AM
SICK
OF
THE
ABUSE
OF
GOVERNMENT
POWER
AS
TOM
JEFFERSON
SAID
WHEN
ALL
GOVERNMENT
SHALL
BE
DRAWN
TO
WASHINGTON
AS
THE
CENTRE
OF
ALL
POWER
IT
WILL
RENDER
POWERLESS
THE
CHECKS
PROVIDED
OF
ONE
GOVERNMENT
ON
ANOTHER
AND
WILL
BECOME
AS
VENAL
AND
OPPRESSIVE
AS
THE
GOVERNMENT
FROM
WHICH
WE
SEPARATED
