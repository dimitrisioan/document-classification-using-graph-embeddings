RE
MY

IS
LIKE

THOMAS

THOMASPIFIUIONO
WRITES
OBSERVATIONS
FROM
A
NAIVE
NORWEGIAN
YUP
YOU
SAID
IT
I
ADMIRE
SUCH
HONESTY
GUNS
ARE
MADE
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
NOT
TO
SHOOT
TARGET
OR
TO
HAVE
SOMETHING
MORE
MACHO
THAN
STAMPS
TO
COLLECT
FIRE
AN
ANSCHUTZ
THEN
COME
BACK
AND
TALK
TO
US
YOURE
LETTING
IGNORANCE
AND
POSSIBLY
FEAR
CLOUD
YOUR
THINKING
EITHER
THAT
OR
THIS
IS
SOUR
GRAPES
BECAUSE
WE
BEAT
YOU
IN
THE
OLYMPIC
SHOOTING
EVENTS
FUNNY
YOUD
THINK
BIATHALON
WOULD
BE
A
NATURAL
SPORT
FOR
THE
NORSE
IT
IS
MORE
EASY
TO
KILLINJURE
SOMEONE
WITH
A
GUN
THAN
WITH
A
KNIFE
OR
A
BAT
AS
IN
BASEBALL
PRECISELY
THAT
MAKES
THEM
THE
BEST
METHOD
OF
DEFENSE
FOR
THE
CITIZENRY
NOT
EVERYBODY
HAS
THE
TIME
TO
TRAIN
WITH
A
GLADIUS
YOU
KNOW
BUT
FOR
SOME
REASON
THOSE
WHO
PREY
ON
OTHERS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
MORE
FREE
TIME
TO
EXTEND
THIS
A
BIT
FURTHER
YOU
NEED
ONLY
A
CERTAIN
LEVEL
OF
COMPETENCE
TO
BEAT
ANOTHER
WITH
A
RANGE
WEAPON
GETTING
IN
THEIR
FACE
WITH
A
WEAPON
AND
WINNING
IS
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
AND
REQUIRES
MORE
TRAINING
TIME
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
JUST
DOES
NOT
HAVE
IVE
SPENT
A
FEW
YEARS
PRACTICING
WITH
A
SWORD
I
CAN
TAKE
THE
COMMON
PERSON
ARMED
WITH
ONE
THOUGH
SELFDEFENSE
ISNT
THE
REASON
I
OWN
ONE
MY
KID
SISTER
WOULD
HAVE
AN
EVEN
CHANCE
OF
BEATING
ME
GUN
VS
GUN
WITH
ONLY
A
MONTH
OF
TRAINING
THAT
MAKES
FIREARMS
MUCH
BETTER
IN
OUR
EYES
ITS
NOT
VERY
WISE
TO
COMPARE
TWO
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES
LIKE
USA
AND
LETS
SAY
ISLAND
ON
ISSUES
LIKE
CRIME
AND
VIOLENCE
EXCELLENT
POINT
PERHAPS
YOU
ARENT
SO
NAIVE
AFTER
ALL
YES
THE
PROBLEM
IS
PEOPLE
COMMITTING
CRIMES
NOT
THE
TOOLS
BEEING
USED
BUT
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
INTO
CONCIDERATION
TAKEN
INTO
CONSIDERATION
IN
WHAT
RESPECT
THOUGH
QUITE
WRONG
LETS
MAKE
IT
A
BLANKET
STATEMENT
FOR
WEAPONS
IN
GENERAL
THIS
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
INTO
CONSIDERATION
WE
CALL
USE
OF
THEM
AGGRIVATED
ASSAULT
ASSAULT
WITH
A
DEADLY
WEAPON
ASSAULT
WITH
INTENT
TO
KILL
ATTEMPTED
MURDER
AND
A
WHOLE
HOST
OF
OTHERS
AND
TACK
ON
EXTRA
PRISON
TIME
WE
HAVE
A
VERY
STRICT
GUNLEGISLATION
IN
NORWAY
BUT
UNTIL
RECENTLY
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
FOR
ENYONE
OVER
YEARS
TO
BUY
A
SHOTGUN
SHOTGUNS
ARE
USED
MAINLY
FOR
HUNTING
IN
NORWAY
BUT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
SO
EASY
TO
ACCUIRE
ONE
IT
WAS
THE
MOST
USED
GUN
IN
CRIMES
IN
NORWAY
I
SUSPECT
IT
WAS
ABOUT
THE
ONLY
WEAPON
AVAILABLE
YOU
CONQUERED
YOUR
LAND
AMONG
OTHERS
A
FULL
MILLENIA
BEFORE
WE
WERE
THOUGHT
OF
AND
SHORTLY
THEREAFTER
WEAPONS
WERENT
QUITE
SO
COMMON
I
SUSPECT
THAT
A
FEW
WORLD
WARS
MADE
A
DIFFERENCE
TOO
SINCE
IN
TIMES
OF
EMERGENCY
WEAPONS
TEND
TO
BE
TURNED
IN
OR
DONATED
TO
NEEDY
CAUSES
IM
CURIOUS
THOUGH
WERE
THE
WEAPONS
USED
IN
THE
CRIMES
BOUGHT
SHORTLY
BEFORE
THE
CRIME
OR
WERE
THEY
AQUIRED
BY
OTHER
MEANS
ANY
REQUIREMENTS
OTHER
THAN
JUST
REGISTERING
THE
SHOTGUN
AND
UNBELIEVABLE
THE
USE
OF
GUNS
IN
CRIME
FELL
THERE
ARE
NOW
A
NEW
LAW
AGAINST
WEARING
LONG
KNIVES
IN
PUBLIC
AND
WHY
SHOULD
IT
BE
ALLOWED
COME
ON
DOWN
TO
HONEST
ERIKS
USED
SWORDS
HERES
A
SLIGHTLYUSED
SHORT
SWORD
THE
BATTLEFIELD
SUPREMACY
WEAPON
OF
THE
ELEVENTH
CENTURY
ONLY
WITH
TRADEIN
EASY
FINANCING
SORRY
I
COULDNT
RESIST
YOU
GUYS
STILL
SLICING
EACH
OTHER
WITH
LONG
KNIVES
OR
IS
THIS
REALLY
NOT
A
PROBLEM
WHAT
I
AS
AN
SCANDINAVIAN
HAVE
PROBLEMS
TO
UNDERSTAND
IS
THAT
YOU
AMERICANS
HAVE
A
MORE
LIBERAL
VIEW
ON
GUNS
AND
VIOLENCE
THAN
ON
NUDITY
AND
SEX
TRY
SHOWING
A
BARE
BREAST
ON
TV
INSTED
OF
VIOLENCE
AND
MURDER
IM
ALL
FOR
THAT
WHAT
GETS
ME
IS
THAT
SCANDANAVIANS
AND
YES
IM
ONLY
A
COUPLE
GENERATIONS
OFF
THE
LONGSHIP
USED
TO
BE
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
FEARED
WARRIORS
ON
THE
PLANET
A
MERE
MILLENIA
AGO
YET
NOW
SEEM
TO
SPEND
THEIR
TIME
SITTING
IN
SPAS
AND
DOING
A
BIT
OF
TOPLESS
SUNBATHING
MAYBE
YOU
HAD
A
BIT
MORE
TIME
AND
A
MORE
HOMOGENEOUS
CULTURE
TO
BECOME
CIVILIZED
WITH
YES
I
KNOW
A
LITTLE
AMERICAN
HISTORY
BUT
IS
IT
A
CIVILHUMAN
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
AN
ASSAULT
GUN
IN
YOUR
HOME
ANDOR
AN
HANDGUN
IN
YOUR
CAR
YES
WERE
TOO
DAMNED
VIOLENT
PARTIALLY
I
BELIEVE
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
NOT
A
HOMOGENEOUS
CULTURE
AND
DONT
IDENTIFY
OURSELVES
AS
AMERICANS
FIRST
AND
FOREMOST
IM
RATHER
PROUD
OF
MY
NORWEGIAN
AND
DANISH
HERITAGE
WHEREAS
I
SUSPECT
YOU
COULDNT
CARE
LESS
ABOUT
THAT
WELSH
BLOOD
IN
YOUR
VEINS
THANKS
TO
A
RAID
IN
IRELAND
BACK
IN
THE
TIME
SCALE
AND
THE
HOMOGENEOUS
CULTURE
ARE
IMPORTANT
EQUALLY
IMPORTANT
IS
A
BASIC
PHILOSOPHICAL
DIFFERENCE
IN
PERSONAL
VERSUS
COLLECTIVE
GOOD
IN
AMERICA
THE
INDIVIDUAL
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
THE
MASSES
PERSONAL
LIBERTIES
ARE
PRIZED
ABOVE
ALL
THIS
IS
SADLY
CHANGING
OF
LATE
BUT
I
TRUST
YOU
NOTICE
HOW
THIS
CALL
FOR
FREEDOM
MAKES
LAWS
THAT
RESTRICT
INDIVIDUALS
FOR
LITTLE
COLLECTIVE
BENEFIT
HATEFUL
TO
AMERICANS
ID
HAZARD
A
GUESS
THAT
WERE
AMERICA
LESS
INTERESTED
IN
FREEDOM
AND
PERSONAL
LIBERTY
AND
MORE
INTERESTED
IN
COLLECTIVE
GOOD
WE
NEVER
WOULD
HAVE
SENT
OUR
ARMED
FORCES
ANYWHERE
ONE
POOR
EFFECT
OF
THIS
CULTURE
WE
HAVE
IS
THAT
WERE
LOOKING
OUT
FOR
OURSELVES
AND
IT
IS
QUITE
EASY
TO
IDENTIFY
WITH
ONLY
A
SMALL
SEGMENT
OF
THE
POPULATION
MY
GRANDMOTHER
TELLS
OF
BEING
DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST
BACK
IN
DENMARK
BECAUSE
SHE
SPOKE
LOW
DANE
WHEREAS
OTHERS
SPOKE
HIGH
DANE
IT
WAS
SHORTLY
AFTER
WORLD
WAR
II
AS
I
REMEMBER
THAT
LOW
DANE
WAS
ABOLISHED
SO
THERE
WAS
ONE
COMMON
DIALECT
WE
CANNOT
FATHOM
SUCH
A
MINOR
THING
BEING
A
PROBLEM
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
EVEN
MORE
OBVIOUS
MEANS
OF
IDENTIFYING
AN
OUTSIDER
THE
BAD
ENGLISH
IS
NOT
MY
FAULT
ITS
PROBABLY
THE
KEYBOARDSOFTWARE

THE
QUALITY

BETTER
THAN
OF
