RE
GUN
LOVERS
WAS
RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
HELL
A
GLOCK
IS
THE
LAST
THING
THAT
SHOULD
BE
SWITCHED
TO
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
I
KNOW
ABOUT
A
GLOCK
IS
THE
LACK
OF
A
REAL
SAFETY
ON
IT
SURE
THERE
IS
THAT
LITTLE
THING
IN
THE
TRIGGER
BUT
THAT
ISNT
TOO
GREAT
OF
A
SAFETY
YOURE
GETTING
WARMER
THE
LITTLE
THING
IN
THE
TRIGGER
HAS
TO
BE
DEPRESSED
BEFORE
THE
TRIGGER
CAN
MOVE
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
IS
THE
DAMNED
THING
WONT
GO
OFF
UNTIL
THE
TRIGGER
IS
PULLED
THIS
MAKES
IT
JUST
ABOUT
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SOME
PROBLEMS
BUT
WERE
ASSUMING
THE
GUN
IS
FUNCTIONING
CORRECTLY
AS
SAFE
AS
A
REVOLVER
THE
GUN
WHEN
WORKING
CORRECTLY
IS
TOTALLY
DROP
SAFE
NOW
IN
POLICE
WORK
THIS
IS
A
CONSIDERATION
THERE
IS
NOT
A
SINGLE
DOCUMENTED
CASE
IM
AWARE
OF
WHERE
A
POLICE
OFFICER
WAS
KILLED
BECAUSE
HE
FAILED
TO
OPERATE
THE
SAFETY
ON
HIS
FIREARM
THERE
ARE
QUITE
A
FEW
DOCUMENTED
CASES
WHERE
CRIMINALS
GOT
HOLD
OF
THE
COPS
GUN
AND
COULDNT
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
TO
GET
THE
SAFETY
OFF
IN
TIME
TO
USE
THE
GUN
THUS
THE
PROPRIETARY
NATURE
OF
THE
SAFETY
TO
THE
CRIMINAL
AT
LEAST
VERY
LIKELY
PREVENTED
THE
OFFICE
FROM
GETTING
SHOT
THE
PURPOSE
OF
A
SAFETY
IS
TO
MAKE
THE
GUN
SAFE
FROM
UNINTENTIONAL
FIRE
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
IT
SHOULD
BE
SO
COMPLICATED
AS
TO
SLOW
DOWN
INTENTIONAL
USE
THUS
THE
GLOCK
SAFETY
IS
PERFECTLY
ADEQUATE
FROM
A
SAFETY
STANDPOINT
BUT
NOT
NECESSARILY
THE
MOST
DESIRABLE
FROM
THE
STANDPOINT
OF
OPEN
CARRY
WHERE
IT
IS
EASILY
GRABBED
BY
SOMEBODY
ELSE
BY
THIS
CRITERIA
IT
DOES
MAKE
A
LOT
OF
SENSE
AS
A
CONCEALED
CARRY
PIECE
FROM
THE
STANDPOINT
OF
POLICE
USE
IT
IS
NO
BETTER
OR
WORSE
THAN
A
REVOLVER
AS
FAR
AS
BEING
PROPRIETARY
TO
THE
OFFICER
IN
THE
METHOD
OF
FIRING
IT
THE
IDEAL
SOLUTION
MAY
SOMEDAY
BE
BIOMETRIC
SENSING
OF
THE
USER
SO
THAT
THE
FIREARM
CANT
BE
USED
BY
ANYBODY
BUT
ITS
OWNER
BUT
FOR
NOW
THE
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
SAFETY
SYSTEMS
HELPS
UNLESS
THE
CRIMINAL
HAPPENS
TO
BE
FAMILIAR
WITH
THAT
PARTICULAR
TYPE
OF
FIREARM
RICK
