your

mgbslacvmslacstanfordedu
says
from
ap
according
to
numerous
accounts
by
those
in
the
compound
the
fire
was
started
by
an
armoured
vehicle
crushing
a
large
propane
tank
and
turning
over
numerous
gas
lanterns
oh
then
why
did
the
smoke
and
flames
start
from
three
different
places
in
particular
three
different
places
where
there
were
no
apvs
and
just
where
is
the
evidence
for
this
fbi
sayso
the
texas
medical
examiner
refuted
of
their
lies
today
and
if
the
government
did
start
the
fire
then
why
werent
people
trying
to
get
out
of
the
compound
let
me
put
you
in
a
building
pump
in
cs
knock
the
walls
down
around
you
and
see
how
fast
you
find
an
exit
and
besides
oh
i
dont
know
why
im
even
bothering
i
dont
know
why
either
youre
willing
to
swallow
everything
fed
you
good
boy
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
willing
to
accept
the
governments
story
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
i
find
it
tremendously
chilling
that
so
many
people
seem
eager
to
believe
a
murderous
heavilyarmed
religious
cult
despite
much
evidence
to
the
contrary
thought
experiment
suppose
this
exact
same
thing
happened
under
the
bush
administration
what
would
your
answer
be
then
would
you
still
prefer
to
believe
the
cultists
oh
a
clinton
apologist
why
didnt
you
say
so
no
i
dont
really
expect
a
response
to
that
challenge
but
then
again
that
is
how
mr
clinton
was
elected
by
people
who
believe
that
his
campaign
promisses
would
be
respected
by
him
once
he
got
into
office
um
isnt
that
how
all
politicians
are
elected
if
people
will
believe
that
of
any
politican
it
is
little
wonder
they
will
believe
all
of
the
factoids
being
given
out
as
fact
by
the
clintonrenofbibatf
confederation
so
is
there
any
particular
reason
the
gummint
decided
to
slaughter
eighty
people
are
they
like
just
plain
evil
or
what
did
they
just
wake
up
one
day
stretch
and
yawn
and
throw
a
dart
at
a
map
of
the
united
states
to
figure
out
who
to
oppress
that
day
im
eager
to
know
the
kgbatf
was
expecting
a
quick
victory
while
the
cameras
rolled
however
they
were
the
only
ones
with
a
script
and
does
bill
clinton
have
cooler
theme
music
than
darth
vader
how
is
he
on
diabolical
laughter
does
he
look
good
in
a
cape
these
things
must
be
investigated
you
first
hey
youre
the
apologist
you
tell
us
so
i
propose
that
we
destroy
the
moon
neatly
solving
that
problem
your
blood
pressure
just
went
up
