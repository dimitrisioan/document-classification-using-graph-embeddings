WATCHED
A

CONCENTRATION
CAMPS
STACKS
AND
STACKS
OF
BODIES
THERE
WERE
SCENES
OF
HITLER
SPEECHIFYING
AND
WHAT
STRUCK
ME
WAS
THE
REVERENCE
AND
ADORATION
ON
THE
FACES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
CROWDS
I
GUESS
THEY
WERE
HAPPY
THAT

HAD
IMPLEMENTED
FULL
GUN
CONTROL
AND
WAS
TAKING
CARE
OF
THE
JEWISH
PROBLEM
ALL
AT
THE
