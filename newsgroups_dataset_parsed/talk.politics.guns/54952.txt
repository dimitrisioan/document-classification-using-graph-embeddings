WRITES
PEOPLE
ARE
GETTING
KILLED
BY
GANG
VIOLENCE
EVERY
DAY
EVERY
SINGLE
DAY
I
HEAR
ABOUT
MORE
PEOPLE
GETTING
KILLED
BY
GANG
VIOLENCE
AND
SEE
SOME
OF
THE
WEAPONS
THAT
ARE
BEING
CONFISCATED
IS
KRATZ
CLAIMING
THAT
HE
CAN
RELIABLY
VISUALLY
DISTINGUISH
AN
FROM
AN
THAT
HE
CAN
SEE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
SEMIAUTO
AND
A
FULLAUTO
UZI
THAT
HE
CAN
SEE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
VARIOUS
VERSIONS
SOME
FULLAUTO
SOME
SEMIAUTO
ONLY
OF
THE
WELL
LET
ME
SEE
UZI
NO
NO
MAYBE
I
REMEMBER
THERE
BEING
A
SELECTOR
SWTICH
ON
THE
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
PLEASE
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
THE
SWITCH
WOULD
SET
TO
AN
OFF
POSITION
OR
AN
ON
POSITION
BECAUSE
THE
GUN
IS
SEMIAUTOMATIC
WOULDNT
THE
HAVE
A
POSITION
FOR
SEMIAUTO
FIRE
AND
FULLAUTO
FIRE
OR
MAYBE
ROUND
BURSTS
IF
THIS
IS
CORRECT
WOULDNT
IT
BE
EASY
TO
DISTINGUISH
EACH
GUN
BY
THIS
ALONE
OF
COURSE
IF
THE
WERE
MODIFIED
TO
FULLAUTO
FIRE
I
WOULDNT
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
THAT
EASY
BUT
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
DISTINGUISHING
BETWEEN
AN
UNMODIFIED
AND
HOW
ABOUT
THE
OTHER
GUNS
DO
THEY
ALSO
HAVE
SELECTOR
SWITCH
TO
SWITCH
BETWEEN
SEMIAUTO
AND
FULLYAUTO
FIRE
IF
SO
ID
LOVE
TO
HEAR
THE
DETAILS
IF
ONLY
BECAUSE
THEYLL
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
KRATZ
IS
BLOWING
SMOKE
CONSIDERING
THAT
ONE
CAN
DESIGN
A
GUN
SO
THAT
IT
LOOKS
JUST
LIKE
ANOTHER
GUN
YET
HAVE
VERY
DIFFERENT
PROPERTIES
AND
THAT
THATS
QUITE
COMMON
MOST
KIDS
IN
MY
NEIGHBORHOOD
WERE
QUITE
YOUNG
WHEN
THEY
FIGURED
OUT
THAT
MY
PARENTS
CAR
WASNT
MUCH
LIKE
RICHARD
PETTYS
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
LOOKED
JUST
LIKE
IT
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
PAINT
JOB
THINGS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
DIFFERENT
WITH
KRATZ
ACTUALLY
IT
WAS
PRETTY
HARD
FOR
THE
KIDS
IN
MY
NEIGHBORHOOD
TO
FIGURE
THAT
OUT
AS
RICHARD
PETTY
LIVED
IN
MY
NEIGHBORHOOD
AND
LEFT
HIS
STOCK
CAR
IN
THE
DRIVEWAY
SURE
ITS
ON
TV
BUT
WHY
DOES
THAT
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
NO
IT
DOESNT
BUT
THATS
IRRELEVANT
IF
VISUAL
INSPECTION
OF
THE
OUTSIDE
WORKED
TV
WOULD
BE
ACCEPTABLE
BUT
SINCE
IT
DOESNT
THE
FACT
THAT
ITS
JUST
AS
GOOD
AS
SEEING
IN
PERSON
DOESNT
MEAN
MUCH
WELL
WHAT
ABOUT
WHAT
I
SAID
ABOVE
IF
THAT
IS
CORRECT
I
GUESS
TV
WOULD
BE
ACCEPTABLE
IF
YOU
HAD
A
GOOD
ENOUGH
PICTURE
AND
A
PICTURE
OF
THE
LOWER
RECEIVER
OF
THE
ANDY
GAVE
KRATZ
A
CHANCE
TO
BACK
DOWN
ON
THIS
IN
PRIVATE
JASON
KRATZ
DIDNT
TAKE
ANDYS
OFFER
TO
BACK
DOWN
IN
PRIVATE
