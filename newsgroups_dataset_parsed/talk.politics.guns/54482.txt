initial
assault
on
the
compound
more
like
a
wooden
farm
house
if
it
burned
to
the
ground
like
it
did
for
what
regardless
of
who
startedcaused
the
fire
none
of
this
would
have
happened
if
the
atf
can
honestly
justify
their
initial
assault
and
handled
it
properly
i
just
got
through
listening
to
the
oclock
news
on
channel
here
in
dallas
they
trotted
out
a
list
of
justifications
produced
by
the
atf
after
months
of
investigation
for
their
raid
i
couldnt
believe
the
junk
on
this
list
for
example
the
bds
were
accused
of
stockpiling
a
bunch
of
and
ammunition
that
can
be
used
in
and
assault
rifles
imagine
thatthey
had
ammunition
they
also
had
aluminum
dust
yeah
its
a
component
of
thermite
but
so
far
i
havent
heard
that
its
illegal
to
take
a
grinder
to
the
aluminum
lawn
furniture
the
only
thing
on
the
list
that
could
conceivably
have
been
illegal
was
an
grenade
launcher
anybody
know
about
this
months
of
investigation
for
this
people
died
