re
waco
dates
are
these
coincidental
i
do
not
think
it
is
at
all
unlikely
that
clinton
ro
his
policy
wonk
facilitators
arranged
the
waco
raid
as
a
display
piece
for
the
gun
war
on
the
constitution
look
at
what
the
bush
administration
did
to
get
material
for
the
drug
war
on
the
constitutionremember
that
baggie
of
crack
george
waved
at
the
cameras
they
took
a
dealer
from
the
ghetto
and
brought
him
to
the
white
house
so
they
could
say
drugs
had
been
dealt
onb
the
white
house
lawn
and
i
dont
think
anybody
could
honestly
think
clinton
would
have
any
moral
qualms
about
the
raid
the
only
really
worrisome
thing
is
that
the
bds
heroic
defense
of
their
ranch
will
make
clintons
gun
war
on
the
constitution
more
successfullexactly
as
he
wanted
the
media
and
politicians
will
filter
this
so
that
the
general
public
will
think
the
bds
are
bad
guys
dont
help
them
stand
up
for
the
bds
with
your
friends
and
family
adnd
in
public
anytime
you
cantheir
supposed
moral
qualms
are
not
important
to
the
issue
they
are
heroes
in
the
fight
against
oppressive
government
it
could
just
as
well
have
been
you
