THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
IS
ABOUT
SOVEREIGNTY
NOT
SPORTING
GOODS
PERFECTLY
CORRECT
BUT
IT
WONT
MAKE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
HMM
I
BEG
TO
DIFFER
IT
WILL
PROBABLY
MAKE
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
AT
SOME
POINT
SELF
DEFENSE
IS
A
VALID
REASON
FOR
RKBA
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
GET
THROUGH
LIFE
WITHOUT
EVER
HAVING
TO
OWN
USE
OR
DISPLAY
A
FIREARM
BESIDES
THERE
ARE
OTHER
MEANS
OF
SELFPROTECTION
WHICH
CAN
BE
JUST
AS
EFFECTIVE
AS
FIREARMS
THANKFULLY
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
GO
THROUGH
LIFE
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
USE
A
FIREARM
HOWVER
THERE
ARE
SITUATIONS
WHERE
FIREARMS
ARE
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
MEANS
OF
SELF
PROTECTION
WHAT
OTHER
MEANS
DO
YOU
PROPOSE
AS
EQUALLY
EFFECTIVE
FREEDOMS
AND
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
DEPENDENT
ON
PUBLIC
OPINION
NECESSITY
OR
SCIENTIFIC
SCRUTINY
NEW
TO
THIS
PLANET
EVERYTHING
IS
DEPENDENT
ON
EITHER
PUBLIC
OR
POLITICAL
OPINION
USUALLY
POLITICAL
TO
IMAGINE
THAT
INALIENABLE
RIGHTS
ARE
SOMEHOW
WIRED
INTO
THE
VAST
COLD
COSMOS
IS
PUREST
EGOTISM
AND
A
DANGEROUS
DELUSION
NEW
TO
THIS
COUNTRY
NEW
TO
POLITICAL
THEORY
ALAS
I
WAS
SPEAKING
OF
PRINCIPLE
WITHOUT
PRINCIPLE
ALL
ATTEMPTS
AT
REPUBLICAN
FORMS
OF
GOVT
ARE
FUTILE
THERE
ARE
TIMES
WHEN
PUBLIC
AND
POLITICAL
OPINION
ARE
CONTRARY
TO
PRINCIPLE
WHICH
IS
WHY
WE
HAVE
A
CONSTITUTION
WHICH
ENUMERATES
GOVT
POWERS
AND
PRESUMES
CERTAIN
RIGHTS
A
MAJOR
REASON
FOR
THIS
WAS
TO
PREVENT
A
TYRANNY
OF
THE
MAJORITY
NO
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
RKBA
CAN
WITHSTAND
SCIENTIFIC
SCRUTINY
THEY
DONT
HAVE
TO
LIKE
SO
MANY
OTHER
THINGS
THE
ISSUE
IS
ONE
OF
PERCEPTION
RATHER
THAN
BORING
STATISTICS
EVERY
TIME
SOME
YOUNG
INNOCENT
IS
GUNNEDDOWN
IN
A
DRIVE
BY
EVERY
TIME
SOME
KID
IS
MURDERED
FOR
A
JACKET
EVERY
TIME
A
STORE
CLERK
IS
EXECUTED
FOR
THREE
DOLLARS
IN
CHANGE
EVERY
TIME
SOME
MORON
KILLS
HIS
WIFE
BECAUSE
SHE
TOOK
THE
LAST
BEER
FROM
THE
FRIDGE
EVERY
TIME
SOMEONE
HEARS
A
BANG
IN
THE
NIGHT
THE
RKBA
DIES
THE
STATS
ARE
NOT
ALL
THAT
CLEARLY
BEHIND
FIREARMS
THE
PROTECTION
FACTOR
DOES
NOT
STRONGLY
OUTWEIGH
THE
MINDLESS
MAYHEM
FACTOR
GIVEN
SOCIETY
AS
WE
NOW
EXPERIENCE
IT
IT
SEEMS
SAFER
TO
GET
RID
OF
AS
MANY
GUNS
AS
POSSIBLE
THAT
MAY
BE
AN
ERROR
BUT
ENOUGH
ACTIVE
VOTERS
BELIEVE
IN
THAT
COURSE
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
WHY
LAW
SHOULD
BE
BASED
ON
REASONED
THOUGHT
NOT
IMMEDIATE
PERCEPTION
OF
COURSE
IT
DOESNT
ALWAYS
WORK
THAT
WAY
FORTUNATELY
WHILE
THERE
ARE
NO
GUARANTEES
LOGIC
SOMETIMES
DOES
PREVAIL
AND
IF
NOT
THERE
ARE
STILL
MEANS
FOR
CORRECTION
AS
FAR
AS
ENOUGH
ACTIVE
VOTERS
ARE
CONCERNED
THAT
IS
STILL
AN
OPEN
QUESTION
UNTIL
THE
VOTE
IS
MADE
HOW
DO
YOU
INTEND
TO
SILENCE
RKBA
SUPPORTERS
TALK
ALL
YOU
WANT
TALK
ABOUT
THE
GOOD
OLD
DAYS
WHEN
YOU
USED
TO
OWN
FIREARMS
AFTER
A
WHILE
SUCH
TALK
WILL
TAKE
ON
THE
CHARACTER
OF
WAR
STORIES
AND
NO
ONE
WILL
BE
VERY
INTERESTED
ANYMORE
YOU
PORTRAY
A
POSSIBLE
SCENARIO
FOR
THE
FUTURE
BUT
HOW
WILL
YOU
SILENCE
RKBA
SUPPORTERS
RIGHT
NOW
AS
LONG
AS
PUBLIC
DEBATE
IS
ALLOWED
SUCH
DEBATE
WILL
CONTINUE
IF
WE
ALLOW
PUBLIC
DEBATE
TO
BE
RESTRICTED
OR
DENIED
THEN
WE
WILL
GET
A
GOVT
WE
DESERVE
AL
STANDARD
