writes
to
rob
and
all
others
that
have
been
debating
about
the
wood
stove
the
original
post
claimed
that
the
atffbi
was
pumping
napalm
into
the
building
with
the
hopes
that
the
wood
stove
inside
would
ignite
it
i
responed
with
why
would
the
wood
stove
be
lit
in
the
first
place
it
wouldnt
be
lit
for
heating
purposes
because
of
the
weather
in
texas
which
statement
is
dead
wrong
because
our
local
posters
have
confirmed
that
it
was
quite
chilly
that
morning
everyone
now
claims
that
it
was
for
cooking
no
we
argue
that
it
was
not
entirely
unreasonable
for
a
woodstove
to
be
operational
stop
and
think
about
this
cs
gas
was
being
pumped
into
the
building
and
i
presume
that
everyone
was
wearing
gas
masks
either
bought
or
some
type
of
makeshift
type
and
this
had
been
going
on
for
hours
i
dont
know
if
you
have
ever
been
around
cs
but
i
have
being
exposed
to
cs
gas
was
part
of
my
army
training
so
i
know
that
without
a
mask
it
very
uncomfortable
and
makes
your
eyes
water
nose
run
and
makes
you
sick
in
the
stomach
and
with
the
mask
it
is
very
difficult
to
drink
water
much
less
eat
so
my
question
now
is
why
were
they
cooking
food
obviously
you
missed
my
earlier
posting
about
the
physica
of
woodstoves
in
brief
you
cant
turn
your
woodstove
on
and
off
like
your
gas
range
it
stays
on
all
the
time
it
even
stays
on
for
over
hours
after
you
shut
it
off
which
is
why
most
working
woodstoves
arent
ever
shut
off
until
spring
