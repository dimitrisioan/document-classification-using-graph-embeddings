WHY
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
REPLY
TO
MY
POST
BY
THE
WAY
I
NEVER
NEVER
EVER
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
RIGHT
TO
SHOOT
THOSE
KIND
OF
BABIES
HOWEVER
IT
WAS
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIAN
PEOPLE
IN
THERE
THAT
INSISTED
ON
STAYING
THERE
WITH
THEIR
SAVIOR
YEAH
RIGHT
BUDY
BOY
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
BRAINWASHED
THEM
INTO
BELIEVING
THAT
WHAT
EVER
HE
SAYS
IS
THE
TRUTH
EVEN
IF
MEANS
THAT
THEY
ARE
TO
GIVE
UP
THEIR
LIVES
FOR
HIS
CAUSE
THEREFORE
IT
IS
DAVIDS
FAULT

SAKE
IF
THEY
HAD
FIRED
A
CRUISE
MISSILE
AT
THE

MORE
PEOPLE
WOULD
HAVE
COME
OUT
ALIVE
IT
WAS
OBVIOUS
TO
ANYONE
WITH
THE
REMOTEST
CONTACT
WITH
REALITY
THAT
SUCH
AN
OUTCOME
WAS
LIKELY
NOT
JUST
POSSIBLE
HOWEVER
THE
FIRE
STARTED
AS
MR

YOU
SEEM
TO
HAVE
ALREADY
ENTERED
