RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE

FRANK
CRARY
SAYS
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANYONE
ELSE
PRACTICE
MARKSMANSHIP
BY
TAKING
THEIR
GUN
OUT
OF
THEIR
COAT
AS
FAST
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
START
SHOOTING
THAT
IS
THE
RECOMMENDED
WAY
TO
PRACTICE
WITH
A
CCW
TOO
AIM
ALONE
IS
NO
D
GOO
FOR
DEFENSE
IF
YOU
CANT
GET
THE
GUN
RAPIDLY
VERY
TRUE
BUT
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
BEING
DONE
WAS
JUST
A
LITTLE
UNUSUAL
IT
LOOKED
TO
ME
LIKE
THEY
WERE
PRACTICING
TO
SHOOT
SOMEONE
THE
POINT
THAT
I
FORGOT
TO
BRING
UP
HERE
AND
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
BEING
A
GANG
MEMBER
OR
NOT
IS
THAT
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
TO
CARRY
A
CONCEALED
WEAPON
IN
THIS
AREA
OR
IN
THE
STATE
OF
ILLINOIS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
PEOPLE
IN
ILLINOIS
DONT
CARRY
CONCEALED
WEAPONS
ILLEGALY
BUT
PRACTICING
LIKE
THAT
WHEN
THERE
ARE
OTHER
PEOPLE
AROUND
WASNT
TOO
BRIGHT
OF
AN
IDEA
THERE
ISNT
NECESSARILY
A
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
PRACTICING
WITH
A
CONCEALED
WEAPON
FOR
SELFDEFENCE
AND
PRACTICING
TO
SHOOT
SOMEONE
ARMED
SELFDEFENCE
DOES
OCCASIONALLY
INVOLVE
SHOOTING
AN
ATTACKER
FRANK
CRARY
CU
BOULDER
I
AGREE
IF
YOU
DONT
PRACTICE
AT
ALL
AND
CARRY
A
GUN
FOR
SELFDEFENSE
YOU
MOST
LIKELY
WOULD
BE
IN
BIG
TROUBLE
IF
A
SITUATION
WERE
TO
ARISE
JASON
