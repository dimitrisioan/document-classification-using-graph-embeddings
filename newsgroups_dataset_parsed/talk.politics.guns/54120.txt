RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
DELETED
AND
AS
FAR
AS
FULLYAUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
YOU
CAN
BE
A
LOT
BETTER
ARMED
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
HIT
WHAT
YOU
AIM
AT
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
HAPPENING
HERE
IS
THE
SITUATION
GETTING
TOTALLY
BLOWN
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
IN
MY
POST
I
WAS
REFERRING
TO
YOUR
REGULAR
PATROLMAN
IN
A
CAR
CRUISING
AROUND
THE
CITY
VS
GANG
MEMBERS
OF
COURSE
THE
POLICE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
THINGS
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
BUT
DO
THEY
USE
TANKS
AND
SUCH
ALL
OF
THE
TIME
OF
COURSE
THEY
DONT
AND
THATS
THE
POINT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
EVERY
DAY
WHEN
I
GO
OUT
TO
LUNCH
I
ALWAYS
SEE
COPS
COMING
IN
THE
MAJORITY
THAT
I
SEE
ARE
STILL
CARRYING
REVOLVERS
NOT
THAT
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
WRONG
WITH
A
REVOLVER
BUT
IF
YOURE
A
COP
THAT
IS
UP
AGAINST
SOME
GANG
MEMBER
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
AUTOMATICS
IN
HIS
COAT
I
MEAN
SEMIAUTO
HANDGUNS
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
EVEN
WITH
TRAINING
I
HAVE
BEEN
AT
A
SHOOTING
RANGE
WHERE
GANG
GANG
MEMBERS
WERE
PRACTICING
SHOOTING
THEY
WERE
ACTUALLY
PRACTICING
TAKING
OUT
THEIR
GUNS
AS
QUICK
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
SHOOTING
AT
THE
TARGET
AND
THEY
WERENT
DOING
TOO
BADLY
EITHER
THE
UNIVERSITY
COPS
HERE
WHO
ARE
ARE
STATE
COPS
ARE
ARMED
BETTER
THAN
THE
CHICAGO
POLICE
IT
SEEMS
MOST
STATE
COPS
ARE
DEFINE
ARMED
BETTER
GO
SHOOT
A
REVOLVER
AND
A
SEMIAUTO
LIKE
THE
COLT
DOES
ONE
FIRES
FASTER
THAN
THE
OTHER
NOPE
ASIDE
FROM
WHICH
FASTER
RATE
OF
FIRE
IS
USUALLY
NOT
DESIRABLE
SURE
IT
MAKES
THE
OTHER
GUYS
DUCK
FOR
COVER
BUT
JUST
YOU
TRYING
HITTING
ANYTHING
WITH
A
THOMPSON
IN
HOSEMODE
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
MILITARY
IS
LIMITING
ITS
NOW
TO
BURSTFIRE
SIMPLE
SEMIAUTO
WOULD
BE
BETTER
BUT
THE
TROOPS
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
ROCK
AND
ROLL
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
WASTEFUL
OF
AMMO
SOMETHING
OFTEN
IN
SHORT
SUPPLY
WHEN
THE
ENEMY
IS
PLENTIFUL
A
REVOLVER
IS
EQUALLY
CAPABLE
AS
A
SEMIAUTO
IN
THE
SAME
CALIBER
A
REVOLVER
ALSO
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
THAT
IF
IT
MISFIRES
YOU
JUST
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
AGAIN
A
DOUBLEACTION
REVOLVER
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THEM
CAN
BE
HANDCOCKED
FIRST
BUT
WILL
FIRE
MERELY
BY
PULLING
THE
TRIGGER
A
MISFIRE
IN
A
REVOLVER
MERELY
MEANS
YOU
MUST
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
AGAIN
TO
ROTATE
TO
THE
NEXT
ROUND
A
REVOLVER
CAN
BE
CARRIED
WITH
THE
CHAMBER
EMPTY
AND
UNDER
THE
HAMMER
FOR
MAXIMUM
SAFETY
BUT
STILL
CAN
BE
DRAWN
AND
FIRED
WITH
AN
EASY
MOTION
EVEN
ONE
HANDED
SPEEDLOADERS
FOR
A
REVOLVER
ALLOW
RELOADS
ALMOST
AS
FAST
AS
MAGAZINES
ON
SEMIAUTOS
CAN
BE
FASTER
DEPENDING
ON
USERS
A
MISFIRE
IN
A
SEMIAUTO
WILL
REQUIRE
YOU
TO
CLEAR
A
JAMMED
SHELL
FIRST
TIME
SPENT
WHICH
CAN
BE
FATAL
AND
A
VITAL
SECOND
OR
SO
IS
OFTEN
LOST
AS
YOU
REALIZE
HEY
ITS
JAMMED
BEFORE
STARTING
TO
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
CLEARING
IT
MOST
SEMIAUTOS
MUST
HAVE
THE
SLIDE
WORKED
TO
CHAMBER
THE
FIRST
ROUND
AND
COCK
THE
HAMMER
SOME
POLICE
CARRY
THEIR
SEMIAUTOS
WITH
THE
CHAMBER
LOADED
AND
HAMMER
COCKED
BUT
A
SAFETY
ENGAGED
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THIS
SAFE
HOWEVER
YOU
MUST
TRADEOFF
SAFETY
TO
GET
THE
SAME
SPEED
OF
EMPLOYMENT
AS
A
REVOLVER
THERE
ARE
SOME
DOUBLEACTION
SEMIAUTOS
OUT
THERE
BUT
THE
COMPLEXITY
OF
OPERATION
OF
MANY
OF
THEM
REQUIRES
MORE
TRAINING
SOME
POLICE
DEPARTMENTS
SWITCHED
TO
GLOCKS
AND
THEN
STARTED
QUIETLY
SWITCHING
MANY
OFFICERS
BACK
TO
THE
OLD
REVOLVERS
TOO
MANY
WERE
HAVING
ACCIDENTS
PARTLY
DUE
TO
THE
POOR
TRAINING
THEY
RECEIVED
NOT
THAT
GLOCKS
REQUIRE
ROCKET
SCIENTISTS
BUT
SOME
COPS
ARE
BAFFLED
BY
SOMETHING
AS
COMPLEX
AS
THE
TIMER
ON
A
VCR
ANYONE
WHO
GOES
ANYONE
SAYING
THAT
THE
CRIMINALS
OBVIOUSLY
OUTGUN
THE
POLICE
DONT
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
FIREARMS
TURN
OFF
COPS
AND
HUNTER
AND
PAY
ATTENTION
I
DO
NOT
SEEK
HERE
TO
SAY
SEMIAUTOS
ARE
JUNK
MERELY
THAT
ASSUMING
THEY
ARE
BETTER
FOR
ALL
JOBS
IS
STUPID
A
COP
WITH
A
REVOLVER
ON
HIS
HIP
AND
A
SHOTGUN
IN
THE
RACK
IS
MORE
THAN
EQUIPPED
FOR
ANYTHING
SHORT
OF
A
RIOT
GUN
CONTROL
IS
HITTING
WHAT
YOU
AIM
AT
IF
YOU
WHIP
OUT
A
WONDERNINE
AND
FIRE
REAL
FAST
YOU
MAY
FIND
YOU
DONT
HIT
ANYTHING
GOOD
CONTROLLED
FIRE
FROM
A
REVOLVER
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
GET
YOU
A
HIT
I
OWN
A
BERETTA
MYSELF
BUT
CONSIDER
IT
INFERIOR
AS
A
CARRY
WEAPON
TO
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
RUGER
SECURITY
SIX
REVOLVER
IF
I
HAVENT
HIT
WHAT
IM
AIMING
AT
IN
THE
FIRST
SHOTS
SOMETHING
IS
QUITE
SERIOUSLY
WRONG
SOMEWHERES
WHILE
I
MIGHT
LIKE
HAVING
THE
BACKUP
CAPACITY
OF
THOSE
EXTRA
SHOTS
IN
CERTAIN
CASES
OVERWHELMINGLY
THE
OF
SHOTS
FIRED
IN
CRIMINAL
ENCOUNTERS
IS
LESS
THAN
WHAT
DO
CROOKS
OVERWHELMINGLY
USE
IN
CRIME
WHY
THE
SAME
NICE
SIMPLE
REVOLVERS
THAT
THE
POLICE
OFTEN
USE
WELL
ACTUALLY
SOME
POLICE
PREFER
THE
MUCH
HEFTIER
MAGNUM
BUT
ANYWAY
OBPLEA
DONT
FLAME
ME
I
PREFER
SEMIAUTOS
FOR
MOST
THINGS
BUT
THEY
INTRODUCE
UNNECCESSARY
COMPLICATIONS
TO
SOMETHING
AS
NERVEWRACKING
AS
AN
ABRUPT
ENCOUNTER
WITH
A
LONE
CRIMINAL
IF
EVERYTHING
HAD
GONE
AS
PLANNED
EVERYTHING
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PERFECT
BATF
