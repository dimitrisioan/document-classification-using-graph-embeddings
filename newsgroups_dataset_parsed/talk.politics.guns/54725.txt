WRITES
THAT
THE

THE
SENSITIVE
CARING
JANET
RENO
DESCRIBED
IT
IS
IT
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
TEAR
GAS
ESPECIALLY
IN
LARGE
CONCENTRATIONS
IS
VERY
DANGEROUS
EVEN
TOXIC
FOR

SEEM
RATHER
HYPOCRITICAL
NOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
THE

BELIEVED
THE

DIDNT
HAVE
GAS
MASKS
BUT

WAS
NOT
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE

KNEW
THAT
THE
CHILDRENS

BE
IN
DANGER
AND
PROCEEDED
UNDER
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
