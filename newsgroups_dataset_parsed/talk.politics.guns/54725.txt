that
the
gas
was
not
harmful
as
the
sensitive
caring
janet
reno
described
it
is
it
as
far
as
i
know
tear
gas
especially
in
large
concentrations
is
very
dangerous
even
toxic
for
small
children
this
makes
the
fbis
supposedconcern
for
the
safety
of
the
children
seem
rather
hypocritical
not
to
mention
that
the
gmen
believed
the
children
didnt
have
gas
masks
but
that
was
not
with
respect
to
the
children
the
point
of
the
gassing
the
feds
knew
that
the
childrens
health
would
be
in
danger
and
proceeded
under
the
assumption
that
the
motherly
instinct
of
the
davidian
women
would
remove
them
from
harms
way
i
busted
a
gut
on
that
one
someone
else
on
the
net
observed
that
the
administrations
appeal
to
a
womans
motherly
instinct
would
never
wash
with
feminists
and
liberals
if
a
republican
were
in
the
white
house
i
say
that
such
an
justification
could
only
come
from
a
feminist
mindset
btw
id
read
in
the
paper
yesterday
that
the
type
of
gas
used
was
the
paper
didnt
provide
any
specifics
about
it
