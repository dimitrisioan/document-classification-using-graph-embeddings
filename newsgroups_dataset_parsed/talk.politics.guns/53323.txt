i
dont
know
how
anyone
can
state
that
gun
control
could
have
no
effect
on
homicide
rates
i
dont
think
anyone
is
arguing
that
there
would
be
no
effect
but
there
would
be
no
net
positive
effect
you
also
have
to
consider
the
negative
side
law
abiding
citizens
armed
with
fireamrs
pistols
for
the
most
part
prevent
between
national
crime
survey
and
dr
kleck
crimes
each
year
those
are
the
extremes
most
studies
find
the
number
to
be
to
about
of
those
crimes
are
homicides
so
private
ownership
of
firearms
saves
approximately
lives
each
year
there
are
roughly
criminal
homicides
and
fatal
accidents
involving
guns
each
year
for
there
to
be
any
net
benefit
you
would
have
to
show
that
gun
control
measures
would
disarm
over
of
the
criminals
currently
using
guns
that
would
be
very
hard
to
do
according
the
the
federal
batf
only
of
criminals
buy
their
guns
over
the
counter
since
gun
control
laws
by
their
very
nature
only
effect
legal
sales
such
a
law
would
remove
all
the
benefits
of
armed
lawabiding
citizens
while
having
only
a
minimal
effect
on
armed
criminals
who
by
and
large
get
their
guns
illegally
that
doesnt
sound
like
a
net
benefit
to
me
there
were
over
accidental
handgun
homicides
in
america
in
most
with
licensed
weapons
since
most
were
with
licensed
weapons
i
assume
you
are
not
supporting
reasonable
laws
ie
waiting
periods
background
checks
licenses
etc
since
only
a
complete
ban
would
alter
the
statistic
you
refer
to
i
assume
thats
what
you
are
supporting
by
the
way
people
dies
in
from
falling
down
stairs
accidental
handgun
deaths
isnt
significant
next
to
other
household
accidents
more
american
children
accidentally
shot
other
children
last
year
than
all
the
handgun
homicides
in
great
britain
children
under
the
age
of
died
by
drowning
from
drinking
poisonous
household
chemicals
like
drano
from
falls
if
the
real
goal
is
to
reduce
the
tragic
accidental
deaths
of
children
wouldnt
a
ban
on
drain
cleaners
be
a
better
palce
to
start
or
perhaps
restricting
ownership
to
professionals
like
plumbers
please
no
dictionary
arguments
about
rates
vs
total
numbers
okay
theyre
offered
for
emphasis
not
comparison
while
you
might
call
it
emphasis
refering
to
completely
two
statistics
in
the
same
sentence
implies
a
comparison
if
it
isnt
valid
and
you
put
the
numbers
together
to
convince
people
you
are
right
the
kindest
thing
i
could
call
it
is
propaganda
