CHIU
WRITES
A
NOTE
ON
THE
LIGHTER
SIDE
IVE
NOTICED
MOST
GUNBANNERS
SOME
OF
MY
FRIENDS
INCLUDED
ARE
THE
ONE
WHO
MAKE
COMMENTS
THAT
INDICATE
THEY
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
RESORT
TO
VIOLENT
SO
ARE
THEY
REALLY
BANNING
GUNS
SO
THEY
WOULDNT
END
UP
SHOOTING
SOMEONE
ELSE
COULD
BE
IT
IS
ALSO
LIKELY
THAT
SINCE
THEY
FEEL
THEY
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
RESORT
TO
VIOLENCE
THEY
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
BELIEVING
THAT
ANYONE
ELSE
WOULD
REACT
OTHERWISE

WELL
I
DID
SAY
WELL
PUT
IT
OUT
AND
WELL
PUT
IT
OUT
WHEN
WE
CAN
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
WE
CAN
PUT
OUT
OR
WHEN
WE
CAN
PUT
IT
OUT
