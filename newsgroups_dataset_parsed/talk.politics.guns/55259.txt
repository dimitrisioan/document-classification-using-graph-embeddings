ive
yet
to
meet
a
group
of
baptists
who
were
stockpiling
cambells
soup
and
and
bangingmarrying
thirteen
yuear
olds
i
dont
recall
saying
baptists
do
any
of
that
though
i
suppose
some
do
and
none
of
them
are
listed
in
the
dictionary
as
characteristics
of
a
cult
my
mother
stockpiled
campbells
soup
when
it
was
on
sale
youre
a
sorry
son
of
a
bitch
if
you
cant
draw
a
distinction
between
these
two
things
you
are
an
intolerent
foulmouthed
human
you
sound
like
you
are
ready
to
join
the
kkk
or
neonazis
with
a
narrow
mind
like
yours
fuck
you
my
paternal
grandparents
died
in
oswiecym
aushwitz
in
the
native
tongue
for
all
of
you
pseudohistorically
literate
people
and
bejing
peking
who
cares
about
native
tongue
as
long
as
we
all
understand
each
other
i
would
suggest
youd
have
to
search
long
and
hard
to
find
someone
with
more
diffuse
sensibilities
oh
not
more
than
a
few
feet
i
wouldnt
think
im
sorry
if
your
paternal
grandparents
died
in
oswiecym
or
aushwitz
which
is
easier
to
say
than
prove
but
if
so
the
lesson
they
paid
thier
lives
for
was
wasted
on
you
just
tootin
my
own
horn
you
are
the
expert
i
often
feel
compelled
to
brag
about
the
circumstances
of
my
grandparents
death
people
like
you
cheapen
our
constitution
by
using
it
to
defend
sociopaths
who
arent
deserved
of
it
get
a
life
and
chill
on
the
paranoia
i
dont
care
about
cults
theres
no
language
problem
here
my
problem
is
with
religious
fanatics
claiming
to
be
god
is
just
a
little
bit
unsettling
stockpiling
several
years
supply
of
canned
foods
and
enough
weapons
to
hold
off
a
company
not
to
mention
the
atf
which
ed
up
in
the
first
place
and
talking
about
how
theyre
going
to
take
care
of
all
of
the
unbelievers
but
granted
up
to
that
moment
hed
done
nothing
wrong
i
recognize
and
respect
that
then
the
atf
discovers
he
doesnt
have
proper
permits
for
some
of
his
purchases
and
failed
to
pay
some
taxes
on
them
a
batf
offense
if
true
then
several
parents
come
forward
and
demand
that
previous
charges
of
child
abuse
be
refiled
there
have
been
interviews
with
some
parents
whose
children
were
in
the
compound
at
some
point
these
parents
claimed
psychological
and
sexual
abuse
the
childrens
statements
supported
these
charges
a
local
offense
if
true
totally
outside
the
batfs
domain
was
it
a
noknock
i
really
havent
heard
anything
on
that
but
clearly
he
was
not
just
another
guy
minding
his
own
business
hell
give
them
all
the
guns
in
the
world
if
they
dont
bother
anyone
but
he
was
a
scary
sort
dont
you
think
i
didnt
know
the
man
just
what
the
tv
chose
to
tell
me
the
sort
of
person
youd
want
your
daughter
to
date
i
thought
there
were
prejudicial
undertones
here
i
would
trust
my
daughters
judgement
i
didnt
think
so
reason
number
one
to
doubt
the
legal
statements
made
by
some
of
the
survivors
note
that
some
of
them
were
made
by
his
guard
wellhesitate
to
say
expertly
trained
killers
i
dont
believe
either
side
blindly
then
he
fired
on
the
atf
thats
not
just
a
little
mistake
or
some
redwhiteand
blue
american
defending
his
home
against
big
brother
if
they
fired
first
without
announcing
in
a
beleivable
way
who
they
were
i
can
pound
on
your
door
and
claim
to
be
the
police
will
you
just
lay
down
and
take
it
if
i
do
then
he
could
be
justified
in
firing
on
the
atf
in
selfdefense
that
shit
doesnt
fly
anyone
with
his
background
that
will
shoot
and
kill
federal
law
enforcement
officials
is
not
some
good
citizen
whose
crusade
enjoys
our
support
hes
a
loose
cannon
just
my
opinion
his
background
what
law
has
he
been
convicted
of
breaking
in
the
past
