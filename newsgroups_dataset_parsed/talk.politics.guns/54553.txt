ANDY
FREEMAN
SAYS
WRONG
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
LEGALLY
CARRY
CONCEALED
IN
IL
AND
THERE
ARE
CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER
WHICH
MANY
PEOPLE
CAN
CARRY
CONCEALED
IS
ACCURACY
REALLY
TOO
MUCH
TO
EXPECT
AS
I
SAID
BEFORE
NO
IT
ISNT
IN
ANOTHER
POST
I
REFERRED
TO
THE
ILLINOIS
STATUTES
AND
HOW
I
LOOKED
UP
THE
LAW
FOR
CONCEALED
CARRY
I
WILL
TYPE
IN
THE
COMPLETE
LAW
AND
POST
LATER
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
PROVE
THAT
I
WAS
CORRECT
USING
ACCURATE
INFORMATION
SO
I
WILL
PUT
SECTIONS
DOWN
HERE
NOW
GOOD
NOW
LETS
LOOK
AT
THOSE
SECTIONS
THEYLL
PROVE
MY
POINT
A
A
PERSON
COMMITS
THE
OFFENSE
OF
UNLAWFUL
USE
OF
WEAPONS
WHEN
HE
KNOWINGLY
CARRIES
OR
POSSESSES
IN
ANY
VEHICLE
OR
CONCEALED
ON
OR
ABOUT
HIS
PERSON
EXCEPT
WHEN
ON
HIS
LAND
OR
IN
HIS
OWN
ABODE
OR
FIXED
PLACE
OF
BUSINESS
ANY
PISTOL
REVOLVER
STUN
GUN
OR
TASER
OR
OTHER
FIREARM
NOTE
THAT
THIS
DOESNT
AFFECT
ALL
CONCEALED
CARRY
LOOK
AFTER
THE
WORD
EXCEPT
IT
ALWAYS
HELPS
TO
READ
THE
LAW
BEFORE
COMMENTING
ON
IT
WOULD
A
PRUDENT
STOREKEEPER
CARRY
CONCEALED
HOW
ABOUT
SOMEONE
AT
HOME
NOTE
THAT
BOTH
ARE
LEGAL
AND
A
LOT
OF
COMMON
PEOPLE
QUALIFY
FOR
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
ANDY
