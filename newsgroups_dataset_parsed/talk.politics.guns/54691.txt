people
are
getting
killed
by
gang
violence
every
day
every
single
day
i
hear
about
more
people
getting
killed
by
gang
violence
and
see
some
of
the
weapos
that
are
being
confiscated
is
kratz
claiming
that
he
can
reliably
visually
distinguish
an
from
an
that
he
can
see
the
difference
between
a
semiauto
and
a
fullauto
uzi
that
he
can
see
the
difference
between
the
various
versions
some
fullauto
some
semiauto
only
of
the
well
let
me
see
uzi
no
no
i
see
that
i
misphrased
my
question
i
should
have
asked
which
fullautos
kratz
can
accurately
distinguish
from
semiauto
lookalikes
i
should
have
also
included
some
semiauto
only
guns
in
my
list
to
see
if
hed
ask
how
to
distinguish
them
from
their
nonexistent
fullauto
relatives
lets
do
the
former
now
kratz
has
claimed
that
he
can
visually
distinguish
fullautos
from
semiautos
for
which
fullautos
is
he
making
that
claim
how
does
he
do
it
lets
get
specific
and
as
exhaustive
as
possible
maybe
i
remember
there
being
a
selector
swtich
on
the
if
i
remember
correctly
please
correct
me
if
im
wrong
the
switch
would
set
to
an
off
position
or
an
on
position
because
the
gun
is
semiautomatic
wouldnt
the
have
a
position
for
semiauto
fire
and
fullauto
fire
or
maybe
round
bursts
maybe
why
is
kratz
asking
about
what
he
told
us
that
he
knows
is
kratz
certain
that
he
can
distinguish
a
three
position
switch
from
a
two
position
switch
via
tv
inspection
does
he
even
get
to
see
the
switch
in
the
typical
police
display
of
guns
note
that
one
might
well
be
able
to
see
this
sort
of
thing
in
a
hands
on
visual
inspection
even
though
it
wont
be
seen
on
tv
and
to
think
that
kratz
was
telling
us
that
seeing
it
on
tv
was
just
as
accurate
as
being
there
how
about
the
other
guns
do
they
also
have
selector
switch
to
switch
between
semiauto
and
fullyauto
fire
why
all
the
questions
kratz
assured
us
that
he
could
make
this
distinction
and
now
hes
asking
us
how
he
did
it
well
what
about
what
i
said
above
if
that
is
correct
i
guess
tv
would
be
acceptable
if
you
had
a
good
enough
picture
and
a
picture
of
the
lower
receiver
of
the
what
about
it
it
only
demonstrates
that
as
i
predicted
kratz
was
blowing
smoke
on
this
andy
gave
kratz
a
chance
to
back
down
on
this
in
private
jason
kratz
didnt
take
andys
offer
to
back
down
in
private
andy
wonders
what
kratz
is
learning
from
this
