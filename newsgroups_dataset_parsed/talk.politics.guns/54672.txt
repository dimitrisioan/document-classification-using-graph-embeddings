AS
SOMEONE

HAS
POINTED

WHY
WOULD

ON
A

DO
YOU

COLD
THANK
YOU
FOR
POINTING
OUT
THE
OBVIOUS
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
SO
CLEARLY
MISSED
IT
I
CANT
STAND
IT
WHEN
PEOPLES
FIRST
REACTION
IS
TO
DEFEND
THE
AGGRESSOR
MINOR
QUIBBLE
THE
ASSUALT
AND
IT
WAS
ONE
BEGAN
NEAR
DAWN
THE
FIRE
DID
NOT
BREAK
OUT
FOR
SEVERAL
HOURS
I
FIND
IT
HIGHLY
UNLIKELY
THAT
THE
BD
WOULD
BE
COOKING
LUNCH
WHILE
ARMORED
VEHICLES
PUNCH
HOLES
IN
THEIR
HOUSE
AND
ARE
PUMPING
IN
TEAR
GAS
THE
LANTERN
STORY
MAKES
MORE
SENSE
EXCEPT
THE
FIRE
SEEMED
TO
SPREAD
TOO
QUICKLY
EVEN
GIVEN
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
BUILDINGS
AND
THE
VERY
HIGH
WINDS
AND
IT
WAS
DAYLIGHT
BUT
I
GUESS
IN
THE
INNNER
RECESSES
IT
COULD
BE
DARKSHUTTERS
PROBABLY
CLOSED
AS
WELL
WHICH
PUTS
US
BACK
TO
THE
FBI
DID
IT
OR
THE
BD
DID
IT
OR
SOME
OTHER
SCREW
UP
OCCURED
WHICH
IS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
FBI
AS
A
MONOLITHIC
ENTITY
DOING
IT
IS
THAT
IT
REQUIRES
EVERYBODY
INVOLVED
TO
KEEP
THEIR
MOUTHS
SHUT
WHILE
THEY
TENDED
TO
BEHAVE
LIKE
TOTAL
IDIOTS
THAT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
THEM
HOMOCIDAL
MANIACS
EITHER
AND
IF
IT
WAS
ONE
NUTCASE
AGENT
THEN
IT
SERVES
NO
PURPOSE
TO
BLAME
THE
WHOLE
AGENCY
I
CAN
BELIEVE
THAT
A
REAL
NUTCASE
LIKE
A
KORESH
WOULD
START
SUCH
A
FIRE
BUT
IM
FAR
FROM
CONVINCED
HE
ACTUALLY
DID
SO
THEN
AGAIN
I
RARELY
GO
OFF
MAKING
BLANKET
CONDEMNATIONS
AND
PRONOUNCMENTS
WITHIN
HOURS
OF
A
VERY
CONFUSING
INCIDENT
OVER
MILES
AWAY

IS
