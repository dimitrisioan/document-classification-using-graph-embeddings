gun
buyback
programs
will
hopefully
have
an
impact
on
accidental
shootings
especially
youths
domestic
disputes
where
a
gun
is
available
in
the
heat
of
emotion
and
anger
and
maybe
keep
a
few
guns
from
being
stolen
and
later
used
in
streetlevel
crime
what
gives
you
the
idea
that
gun
buyback
programs
will
have
an
impact
on
any
of
these
things
evidence
please
please
dont
misinterret
what
i
was
saying
joe
i
was
making
the
point
tha
there
is
no
evidence
of
effect
of
gun
buyback
programs
but
hopefully
if
there
is
any
effect
it
may
prevent
injuries
or
deaths
in
one
of
these
types
of
common
incidents
if
youre
a
research
associate
in
urban
child
research
then
perhaps
you
can
comment
for
us
on
the
ratio
of
the
accidental
gun
death
rate
to
the
rate
of
accidental
death
from
other
single
causes
follow
that
perhaps
with
some
sort
of
justification
for
the
amount
of
effort
that
antigunners
spend
trying
to
convince
the
country
that
accidental
gunrelated
death
among
children
in
the
us
is
a
serious
problem
firearms
are
the
fifthleading
cause
of
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
i
am
not
trying
to
use
accidental
gunrelated
deaths
among
children
as
a
justification
for
gun
control
who
needs
to
be
convinced
that
accidental
gun
deaths
of
children
is
a
serious
problem
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
any
death
is
serious
wanna
discuss
match
control
firearms
related
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
are
the
fault
of
one
or
more
negligent
persons
not
the
gun
did
i
say
that
a
child
who
unintentionally
shoots
someone
is
not
negligent
no
i
hate
to
repeat
myself
jim
but
like
i
told
joe
i
was
not
attempting
in
any
way
to
justify
gun
control
youre
right
any
death
is
serious
that
was
my
point
to
joe
who
said
that
antigunners
try
to
convinve
the
country
that
accidental
gun
deaths
related
to
children
are
a
serious
problem
i
guess
i
assumed
everyone
thought
that
it
was
a
problem
no
i
dont
want
to
discuss
match
control
i
dont
equate
a
book
of
matches
to
a
loaded
millimeter
either
dont
confuse
the
issue
and
please
dont
say
that
tired
old
nra
line
guns
dont
kill
people
people
kill
people
sure
people
can
kill
people
without
guns
but
easy
access
to
guns
makes
it
a
lot
more
convenient
guns
dont
kill
people
people
with
easy
access
to
guns
kill
people
more
than
anything
gun
buyback
programs
are
symbolic
offerings
to
the
community
in
that
sense
i
think
they
might
do
a
little
good
please
explain
why
you
think
symbolic
offerings
do
good
my
point
was
gun
buyback
programs
which
are
almost
always
run
by
police
departments
might
i
stress
might
do
a
little
i
stress
little
good
by
giving
people
the
impression
that
the
police
are
attempting
to
respond
to
interpersonal
gun
violence
in
a
unique
way
overall
i
thought
that
i
had
made
it
clear
that
i
did
not
think
that
gun
buyback
programs
were
useful
providing
false
hope
then
is
the
intent
jim
im
just
saying
how
it
is
im
not
saying
if
that
is
a
good
thing
or
not
from
the
police
who
i
have
talked
with
who
run
some
of
these
gun
buyback
programs
i
get
the
impression
that
they
really
think
they
are
having
an
impact
on
the
community
when
i
ask
them
if
they
have
an
evaluatory
component
to
the
program
they
say
well
no
so
in
answer
to
your
question
no
false
hope
is
not
the
intent
i
think
the
intent
is
to
show
folks
that
police
are
attempting
to
do
something
to
curb
interpersonal
gun
violence
whether
its
effective
or
not
look
if
you
cant
measure
the
impact
of
these
programs
using
some
sort
of
pretest
and
posttest
evaluation
what
is
the
point
it
must
be
symbolic
in
nature
the
police
are
essentially
saying
look
if
you
have
a
gun
lying
around
and
you
dont
want
it
well
give
you
for
itbecause
we
care
about
the
community
if
you
i
and
joe
could
think
of
a
way
to
measure
the
effectiveness
or
ineffectiveness
of
these
programs
we
could
become
rich
and
famous
i
do
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
guns
that
are
used
by
youths
or
brought
to
school
by
youths
on
a
daily
basis
about
youths
are
obtained
easily
and
quickly
through
a
personal
friend
or
more
often
borrowed
from
a
parent
without
their
knowledge
i
suggest
you
go
back
and
look
at
wherever
you
saw
these
statistics
i
suspect
youll
find
if
you
look
carefully
that
is
the
number
of
students
estimated
to
have
carried
a
weapon
not
necessarily
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
past
year
and
not
the
number
of
students
who
carry
a
gun
to
school
daily
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
if
you
look
carefully
you
will
see
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
the
cdc
also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty
house
have
access
to
guns
in
their
home
california
schools
reported
a
increase
in
student
gun
confiscations
between
and
and
a
increase
between
and
florida
reported
a
percent
increase
in
gun
incidents
in
schools
between
amd
these
are
the
statistics
increase
in
california
schools
eh
gun
control
is
working
fine
there
i
didnt
anything
about
gun
control
what
are
you
talking
about
thus
willing
to
follow
a
man
who
claimed
to
be
the
messiah
got
news
for
you
folks
if
the
big
cheese
was
on
this
crazy
planet
of
ours
presently
he
would
not
be
carrying
a
gun
or
holding
children
when
they
were
in
danger
holding
kids
time
for
a
reality
check
son
these
kids
were
the
children
of
the
people
inside
who
believed
that
the
forces
of
evil
were
outside
waiting
to
kill
them
would
you
send
your
children
out
the
door
if
you
believed
as
they
did
okay
maybe
i
worded
it
wrongdad
i
meant
that
to
put
children
in
a
situation
fortified
compound
where
harm
could
come
to
them
is
not
the
act
of
a
messiah
in
my
opinion
im
not
saying
that
koresh
had
control
over
these
children
directly
but
i
would
hope
that
whatever
messiah
there
is
would
not
let
innocent
children
die
if
as
he
claimed
he
was
the
messiah
and
people
followed
him
as
such
why
did
he
not
tell
their
parents
to
free
the
children
instead
of
letting
them
burn
alive
thanks
for
the
reality
check
joe
its
been
real
so
your
religion
is
different
does
that
make
it
his
wrong
even
assuming
koresh
actually
made
that
decision
and
the
verdict
is
still
out
on
that
jim
listen
to
me
i
said
im
not
religious
whatsoever
do
you
understand
religion
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
i
could
care
less
what
religion
they
were
okay
to
put
children
in
that
situation
is
wrong
pure
and
simple
difference
is
good
jim
i
am
the
most
progressive
and
diverse
person
in
the
world
but
if
different
is
allowing
kids
to
be
exposed
to
tanks
and
teargas
then
yes
jim
different
is
wrong
