WHEN
YOU
ASK
THE
QUESTION
OF
THE
AUTHORITIES
OR
SPONSORS
OF
BUYBACK
PROGRAMS
WHETHER
THEY
WILL
CHECK
FOR
STOLEN
WEAPONS
AND
THEY
ANSWER
NO
ITS
TOTAL
AMNESTY
GOOD
POINT
ABOUT
REGISTRATION
SCHEMES
BEING
USED
ONLY
FOR
HARASSMENT
DELETED
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THIS
IS
RECEIVING
STOLEN
PROPERTY
AND
IS
NO
DIFFERENT
THAN
A
PAWN
SHOP
OWNER
DOING
THE
SAME
THING
MYRON
PETRO
NRA
USPSA
DVC
YALL
THE
OPINIONS
INCLUDED
IN
THIS
POST
ARE
MY
SOLE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
ARE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
AND
GUARNTEED
BY
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
AN
INTERESTING
IDEA
CONSIDER
AT
ANY
LOCALITY
WHERE
A
BUYBACK
PROGRAM
IS
BEING
INSTITUTED
GET
A
LIST
OF
GUNS
THEY
RECEIVED
AND
COMPARE
SERIAL
NUMBERS
WITH
A
LIST
OF
STOLEN
GUNS
AND
SUE
THE
PEOPLE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
PROGRAM
IF
THOSE
GUNS
WERE
DESTROYED
CRIMINAL
CHARGES
CAN
ALSO
BE
MADE
RECEIVING
STOLEN
PROPERTY
DESTRUCTION
OF
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
ETC
