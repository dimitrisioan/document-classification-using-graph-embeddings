STATEMENT
ON
WACO
STANDOFF
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
COMPLETENESS
I
THOUGHT
READERS
OF
THESE
NEWSGROUPS
WOULD
WANT
TO
SEE
FBI
DIRECTOR
WILLIAM
SESSIONS
STATEMENT
AS
RELEASED
BY
THE
FBI
PRESS
OFFICE
FBI

WASHINGTON
APRIL
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
A
STATEMENT
BY
FBI
DIRECTOR
WILLIAM
S
SESSIONS
REGARDING
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIAN
INCIDENT
IN
WACO
TEXAS
I
HAD
HOPED
TO
BE
MAKING
A
VERY
DIFFERENT
STATEMENT
THIS
EVENING
AFTER
VERY
CAREFUL
PLANNING
AND
EXTENSIVE
PREPARATION
WE
ALL
THOUGHT
THAT
TODAYS
EFFORTS
BY
THE
FBI
TO
BRING
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
OUT
OF
THEIR
COMPOUND
WOULD
RESULT
IN
THE
PEACEFUL
RESOLUTION
OF
THE
STANDOFF
OR
AT
LEAST
MEANINGFUL
NEGOTIATION
INSTEAD
WE
ARE
FACED
WITH
DEVASTATION
AND
DEATH
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
NO
QUESTION
THAT
OUR
PLAN
WAS
CORRECT
AND
WAS
CONDUCTED
WITH
EXTREME
PROFESSIONALISM
AND
CARE
I
APPLAUD
THE
RESTRAINT
SHOWN
BY
AGENTS
IN
THE
FACE
OF
LIFETHREATENING
GUNFIRE
AND
I
THANK
THEM
FOR
RISKING
THEIR
LIVES
TO
TRY
TO
END
THIS
PEACEFULLY
I
HAVE
ONLY
THE
GREATEST
ADMIRATION
FOR
THE
COURAGE
AND
PROFESSIONALISM
OF
ALL
INVOLVED
