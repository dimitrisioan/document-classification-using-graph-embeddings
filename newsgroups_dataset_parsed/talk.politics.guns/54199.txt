HAVE
SEVERAL
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
BRADY
BILLS
AND
ARE
THESE
THE
CURRENT
VERSIONS
OF
THE
BRADY
BILL
WHAT
IS
THE
STATUS
OF
THESE
BILLS
IVE
HEARD
THEYRE
IN
COMMITTEE
HOW
CLOSE
IS
THAT
TO
BEING
MADE
LAW
AND
SEEM
FAIRLY
SIMILAR
ARE
THERE
ANY
IMPORTANT
DIFFERENCES
I
MISSED
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
SOME
SERIOUS
LOOPHOLES
A
DOESNT
SPECIFY
AN
APPEALS
PROCESS
TO
WRONGFUL
DENIAL
DURING
THE
WAITING

OTHER
THAN
A

AN
APPEALS
PROCESS
ONCE
THE
REQUIRED
INSTANT
BACKGROUND
CHECK
SYSTEM
IS
ESTABLISHED
BUT
NOT
BEFORE
B
THE
POLICE
ARE
EXPLICITLY
NOT
LIABLE
FOR
MISTAKES
IN
DENYINGAPPROVING
USING
EXISTING
RECORDS
SO
WHO
WOULD
I
SUE
IN
A
ABOVE
TO
HAVE
AN
INACCURATE
RECORD
CORRECTED
C
INCLUDES
AN
EXCEPTIONTOWAITINGPERIOD
CLAUSE
FOR
IF
A

DOESNT
SAY
EXACTLY
WHAT

CONSIDERED
A
THREAT
NOR
DOES
IT
PLACE
A
LIMIT
ON
HOW
LONG
THE
CLEO
TAKES
TO

AN
EXCEPTION
STATEMENT
TRUE
HAVE
I
MISUNDERSTOOD
ANY
OTHER
HOLES
WITH
JUST
WHATS
TO
STOP
A

WITH
A
CLEAN
RECORD
FROM
BUYING
GUNS
GRINDING
OFF
THE
SERIAL
NUMBERS
AND
SELLING
THEM
TO
CROOKS
AT

WHAT
ADDITIONAL

ARE
NEEDED
TO
PREVENT
THIS
SEEMS
AT
MIN
A
GUN
COUNTING
SCHEME
WOULD
BE
NEEDED
EG

WOULDNT
BE
SURPRISED
TO
SEE
