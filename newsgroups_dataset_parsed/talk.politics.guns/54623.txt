ONCE
UPON
A
TIME
AMERICAN
AND
EUROPEAN
UNIVERSITIES
WERE
FULL
OF
ANGRY
YOUNG
PEOPLETM
THAT
WANTED
TO
OVERTHROW
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
WOULDNT
THINK
TWICE
ABOUT
LOBBING
A
MOLOTOV
COCKTAIL
AT
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
MILITARY
POLICE
IN
EUROPE
CERTAINLY
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
BAD
FORM
TO
TAKE
ANYTHING
THE
SYSTEMTM
SAID
AT
FACE
VALUE
THIS
WAS
IN
THE
END
OF
THE
SIXTIES
AND
THE
BEGINING
OF
THE
SEVENTIES
IM
TOLD
I
WAS
TOO
YOUNG
TO
REMEMBER
SOMETHING
WRONG
HAPPENED
ALONG
THE
WAY
IM
AFRAID
MAYBE
THE
WEST
BECAME
JUST
TOO
COMFORTABLE
OR
MAYBE
I
WAS
BORN
TOO
LATE
YOURS
DISAPPOINTED
WITH
WITH
THE
YOUTH
OF
TODAY
PS
HALF
SMILIES
IMPLIED
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
LINING
UP
PEOPLE
AGAINST
THE
WALL
AND
EXECUTING
THEM
AND
CAUSING
THEIR
DEATHS
THROUGH
NEGLIGENCE
IMCOMPETENCE
I
HONESTLY
HOPE
WE
WITNESSED
THE
LATTER
AS
THEY
SAY
THE
ALTERNATIVE
IS
TOO
HORRIBLE
TO
CONTEMPLATE
IM
SURE
THE
ABUSED
CHILDRENTM
FROM
THE
COMPOUND
ARE
MUCH
SAFER
NOW
