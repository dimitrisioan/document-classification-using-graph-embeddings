WRITES
EVERYONE
IS
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
THE
DEBACLE
IN
WACO
IT
IS
HARD
TO
UNDERSTAND
ALL
THIS
ANGST
WHAT
HAPPEND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
LESS
THAN
WHAT
WE
WANTED
TO
HAPPEN
WHY
ALL
THE
SOUR
GRAPES
CUTE
WORD
ANGST
CONVEYS
VOLUMES
ID
BE
INTERESTED
IN
THIS
PARTICULAR
DEFINITION
OF
WE
ITS
SUCH
A
FLUID
PRONOUN
BATF
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
A
PROPAGANDA
EVENT
TO
COUNTERACT
THEIR
IMPENDING
BUDGET
CUTS
THE
ATTENDANCE
OF
THE
PRESS
AT
THE
INITIAL
BIG
COMMANDO
RAID
IS
PROOF
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EVER
SO
EASIER
TO
GRAB
KORESH
AND
HIS
CENTRAL
FOLLOWERS
AS
THEY
SHOPPED
IN
WACO
ALAS
NO
PROPAGANDA
VALUE
THERE
THE
FBI
SCREWEDUP
BIG
TIME
ALL
THE
TIME
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
NEVER
ALLOWED
THE
SITUATION
TO
DRAG
OUT
LIKE
THAT
A
QUICK
SECOND
ASSAULT
BEFORE
THE
BDS
COULD
DECIDE
ON
A
STRATEGY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
BETTER
PLAN
THE
BDS
THEMSELVES
WERE
THE
BIGGEST
SCREWUPS
THOUGH
THEY
IMAGINED
THAT
US
LAW
AND
US
LAWENFORCEMENT
HAD
NO
JURISDICTION
WITHIN
THEIR
LITTLE
COUNTRY
WRONG
THE
BD
WERE
A
PARANOID
LITTLE
CULT
OUT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
NOWHERE
WHICH
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN
HAD
THEIR
WORST
PARANOID
FEARS
REINFORCED
JOY
THEY
HAD
NO
RIGHT
WHATSOEVER
TO
FIRE
ON
THE
BATF
AND
IF
THEY
MISTOOK
THEIR
IDENTITY
INITIALLY
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
SURRENDERED
AT
ONCE
WHEN
THEY
DID
REALIZE
WHO
THEY
WERE
YES
THEY
PROBABLY
SHOULD
HAVE
ALTHOUGH
HOW
MANY
PARANOID
NUTS
CAN
SAY
THEY
HELD
OFF
THE
FEDS
FOR
DAYS
IF
THE
BDS
HAD
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
WARRANTS
THEY
TAKE
IT
TO
COURT
JUST
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
US
IF
THEY
WANTED
FULLAUTO
WEAPONS
THEY
COULD
HAVE
OBTAINED
THE
PROPER
PERMITS
JUST
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
US
WOULD
NEED
TO
DO
WHAT
THEY
MAY
NOT
DO
IS
DECIDE
FOR
THEMSELVES
WHAT
US
LAW
APPLIES
TO
THEMSELVES
AND
WHICH
DOES
NOT
THEY
GET
THEIR
CHANCE
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
US
AT
THE
VOTING
BOOTH
THE
VOTING
BOOTH
IS
HIGHLY
OVERRATED
PEOPLE
NEED
TO
GET
UP
OFF
THEIR
LAZY
BUTTS
MORE
THAN
EVERY
YEAR
OR
EVERY
TWO
YEARS
HELL
MOST
DONT
EVEN
DO
THAT
IF
THE
BATF
AND
FBI
HAVE
BECOME
LATTERDAY
GESTAPO
THEN
THEY
HAVE
BECOME
THAT
WAY
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
DESIRED
THEM
TO
BE
SO
NO
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
DECIDED
THAT
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
ENOUGH
DIFFERENCE
TO
US
TO
GET
UP
AND
DO
SOMETHING
THATS
SOMETHING
FOR
INSTANCE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
GO
SPEAK
AGAINST
GUN
CONTROL
BILLS
AT
THEIR
LOCAL
GOVERNMENT
DOZENS
OF
PROGUN
SPEAKERS
SHOW
UP
AND
FEW
IF
ANY
ANTIS
DO
BUT
THEY
OFTEN
WIN
ANYWAY
WHY
BECAUSE
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
WHO
SHOWS
UP
IT
MATTERS
WHOS
WILLING
TO
SCREAM
AFTERWARDS
AND
IT
ISNT
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
GIVE
A
DAMN
ONE
WAY
OF
THE
OTHER
BUT
THAT
THEY
DONT
NOBODY
GIVES
A
DAMN
ABOUT
ANYBODY
BEYOND
THEIR
OWN
LITTLE
WORLDS
WE
GET
TO
VOTE
ON
LAWS
AND
ON
THE
LAWMAKERS
BY
OUR
CHOICES
OVER
THE
YEARS
WE
HAVE
APPROVED
THE
CREATION
AND
FORM
OF
THE
BATF
AND
FBI
WHEN
THE
FBI
WAS
OUT
CHASING
PINKOS
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
DIDNT
SEEM
TO
MIND
A
BIT
OF
EXTRACONSTITUTIONAL
ACTIVITY
THE
GENERAL
PUBLICS
USUALLY
NOT
EVEN
READ
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
LEARNED
IS
A
DISTORTED
PICTURE
OF
THE
WHOLE
THING

OF
CONTINUING

I
STILL
REMEMBER
THE
WAY
YOU
LAUGHED
WHEN
YOU
PUSHED
ME
DOWN
THE

SOMETIMES
I
GET
TO
THINKING
YOU
DONT
