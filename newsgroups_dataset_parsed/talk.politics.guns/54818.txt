WRITES
WOULD
SOMEBODY
PLEASE
POST
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
GUN
CONTROL
ACT
OF
IS
A
VERBATIM
TRANSCRIPTION
OF
A
NAZI
LAW
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
THAT
THE
TWO

BASICALLY
IDENTICAL
HOWEVER
THATS
NOT
EVIDENCE
THAT
ONE
IS
A
COPY
OF
THE
OTHER
THERES
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
GCAS
AUTHORS
USED
THE
NAZI
LAW
AS
A
GUIDE
YES
THEY
ENDED
UP
WITH
ROUGHLY
THE
SAME
THING
BUT
THAT
COMES
FROM
THEIR
SHARED
GOAL
DISARMING
THOSE
MENACING
MINORITIES
I
THOUGHT
THE
SAME
THING
TOO
UNTIL
JPFOS

IN
THE
LATEST

MAKES
IT
CERTAIN
THAT

DEFINITELY
ASKED
FOR
A
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
GERMAN
WEAPONS

SEE
WHAT
YOU
THINK
OF
JPFOS

THE

THE
ORIGINALS
LEFT
FROM
THE

AND
THEY
ARE
ASKING
THAT
FOLKS
REQUEST
OF
JOHN
DINGELL
THAT
HE
INTRODUCE
LEGISLATION
TO
LIFT
GCA
SOMETHING
WHICH
I
WOULD
SUPPORT
WHOLE
HEARTEDLY
ANDY

A
GENERAL
IDEA
OF
WHAT
GCA
DOES
