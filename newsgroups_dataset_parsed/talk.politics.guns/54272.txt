JOHN
W
REDELFS
WRITES
HOW
MANY
ARE
AWARE
THAT
THE
GUN
CONTROL
ACT
OF
IS
A
VERBATIM
TRANSLATION
OF
A
NAZI
GUN
CONTROL
LAW
PASSED
SHORTLY
BEFORE
THE
HOLOCAUST
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
THINK
IM
BEING
PARANOID
IN
ASKING
THESE
QUESTIONS
PRAY
THAT
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
UNCHECKED
DEMOCRACIES
USUALLY
END
IN
DICTATORSHIP
REMEMBER
GERMANY
WAS
A
DEMOCRACY
WHEN
HITLER
ROSE
TO
POWER
CAN
WE
BE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
NOTHING
LIKE
THAT
COULD
HAPPEN
TODAY
I
CANT
SPEAK
FOR
THE
ORGANIZATIONS
YOU
CITED
BUT
EVERYWHERE
YOU
LOOK
IN
OUR
SOCIETY
AND
GOVERNMENT
ONE
CAN
SEE
THE
RELENTLESS
MOVEMENT
TOWARD
ONE
WORLD
GOVERNMENT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
MEDIA
DEMEANS
SUCH
CHARISHED
VALUES
AS
PATRIOTISM
NATIONALISM
AND
PROTECTIONISM
ARE
SOME
OF
THE
CLUES
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
ARE
SAPPING
THE
ECONOMIC
STRENGTH
OF
AMERICANS
TO
PROP
UP
A
FORMER
AND
POSSIBLY
FUTURE
ENEMY
IS
JUST
ANOTHER
THE
FACT
THE
WORDS
LIKE
COMMUNITY
OF
NATIONS
GLOBAL
VILLAGE
AND
INTERNATIONAL
BUSINESS
ARE
IN
VOGUE
ARE
OTHERS
INTERNATIONAL
CORPORATIONS
ARE
DESTROYING
OUR
IDENTY
AND
ECONOMY
AND
THE
PROPAGANDA
THEY
ARE
PLAYING
THROUGH
THE
MEDIA
AND
GOVERNMENT
IS
OVER
POWERING
OUR
ABILITY
TO
RESIST
OUR
POROUS
BORDER
BOTH
PEOPLE
AND
TRADE
ARE
AN
INDICIATION
THAT
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
LOST
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
SOVERGNTY
THE
BOTTOME
LINE
IS
THAT
THE
SINGLE
MOST
EVIL
ASPECT
OF
ONE
WORLD
GOVERNMENT
IS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
NOWHERE
TO
RUN
TO
AND
HISTORY
HAS
PROVEN
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
DISASTER
BEWARE
THE
LIBERAL
AND
THE
CONSERVATIVE
AND
THE
MODERATE
THINK
FOR
YOURSELF
