THE
TRUTH
ABOUT
WACO

DAN
HARTUNG
WRITES
JGDDIXIECOM
JOHN
DE
ARMOND
WRITES
THE
TANKS
WERE
COLLAPSING
INTERIOR
WALLS
AND
CEILINGS
PUTTING
PEOPLE
AT
GREAT
RISK
DEAR
DEAR
THEY
COULD
HAVE
COME
OUT
THEN
BY
YOUR
LOGIC
THE
JEWS
IN
EUROPE
IN
THE
WERE
THE
CAUSE
FOR
THE
HOLOCAUST
HITLER
TOLD
THEM
TO
LEAVE
AND
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDNT
THEY
BROUGHT
THE
WHOLE
THING
ON
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
AS
YOU
SAY
THEY
COULD
HAVE
COME
OUT
OF
GERMANY
THERE
WAS
NO
GROUP
INSTRUCTION
OF
ANY
KIND
FROM
KORESH
OR
HIS
AIDS
AFTER
THE
TANK
INVASION
REFERRING
TO
ANY
KIND
OF
SUICIDE
PACT
OR
COUNTERASSAULT
EFFORTS
ITS
ULTIMATELY
IRRELEVANT
WHO
LIT
THE
FIRE
THEY
HAD
AMPLE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
LEAVE
SAME
FOR
THE
JEWS
IN
EUROPE
WHILE
HE
WAS
THERE
ANYWAY
OUTSIDERS
RARELY
SEE
ABUSE
ITS
A
SECRETIVE
THING
ALL
WE
HAVE
TO
GO
ON
ARE
THE
COURT
DOCUMENTS
IN
THE
JEWELL
CASE
AND
THE
MISTRIAL
IN
CALIFORNIA
YOU
DONT
SEE
ANY
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
ABUSE
THEREFORE
IT
MUST
BE
TAKING
PLACE
AS
YOU
POINT
OUT
EVERWHERE
BUT
HERE
IT
IS
IRRELEVANT
TO
THIS
CASE
THE
ATF
IS
NOT
IN
CHARGE
OF
INVESTIGATING
CHILD
ABUSE
NO
ONE
WAS
EVER
HELD
AGAINST
THEIR
WILLS
AND
COULD
HAVE
LEFT
AT
ANY
TIME
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
MURDERED
IN
THE
FIRE
WERE
THERE
BY
THEIR
OWN
CHOICES
EXACTLY
BY
THEIR
OWN
CHOICE
IN
OBVIOUS
CONTRADICTION
TO
THE
STATEMENTS
MADE
BY
THE
F
B
I
I
HAVE
NEVER
JUDGED
THEM
BY
THEIR
RELIGION
BUT
BY
THEIR
ACTIONS
AND
JUST
WHAT
ARE
THOSE
ACTIONS
THAT
YOU
ARE
JUDGING
THEM
BY
THEIR
REFUSAL
TO
LET
THE
GOVERNMENT
CONTROL
THEIR
LIVES
THEIR
REFUSAL
TO
SUBMIT
TO
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
LAWS
THEIR
REFUSAL
TO
BEHAVE
LIKE
COWARDS
SOME
OF
TEXAS
HEROS
COULD
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
COWARDLY
WAY
OUT
TOO
AND
SURRENDERED
THE
ALAMO
AFTER
ALL
ALL
THEY
HAD
TO
DO
WAS
COME
OUT
THEY
STAYED
AS
YOU
SAY
BY
THEIR
OWN
CHOICE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
EVERYONE
CHOOSES
TO
ACT
LIKE
A
GROVELING
DOG
IN
THE
FACE
OF
INSURMOUNTABLE
ODDS
BUT
AS
YOU
POINT
OUT
THEY
CERTAINLY
DO
HAVE
THAT
RIGHT
IF
THEY
HAD
LIVED
A
QUIET
RELIGIOUS
LIFE
AS
THEY
CLAIMED
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NO
RAID
NO
SIEGE
AND
NO
DEATHS
INSTEAD
THEY
CHOSE
COURSES
OF
ACTION
AT
EVERY
TURN
THAT
WERE
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
STUPID
IF
NOT
IRRATIONAL
THE
FIRST
WAS
TO
STOCKPILE
WEAPONS
THE
SECOND
WAS
TO
SHOOT
FEDERAL
AGENTS
THE
THIRD
WAS
TO
STAY
INSIDE
BULL
THEY
DID
IN
FACT
LIVE
A
QUIET
RELIGIOUS
LIFE
AS
THEY
CLAIMED
THE
WARRANT
WAS
NOT
ISSUED
BECAUSE
THEY
STOCKPILED
WEAPONS
IT
IS
NOT
AGAINST
THE
LAW
TO
OWN
AS
MANY
GUNS
AS
YOU
WANT
YET
EXCEPT
IN
VIRGINIATHE
WARRANT
WAS
ISSUED
FOR
SOME
GUN
PARTS
THAT
ARE
ABOUT
THE
SIZE
OF
A
HALFDOLLAR
CERTAINLY
WORTH
THE
LIVES
OF
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
DONT
YOU
THINK
JUST
AS
WE
DONT
BLAME
A
COP
WHO
SHOOTS
A
KID
WHO
HAD
POINTED
A
TOY
WEAPON
AT
HIM
I
DONT
THINK
THE
FBI
DESERVES
BLAME
IN
THIS
CASE
YOU
CAN
FORGET
THAT
WE
BUSINESS
I
CERTAINLY
DO
BLAME
THEM
HE
WHO
WOULD
TRADE
HIS
LIBERTY
