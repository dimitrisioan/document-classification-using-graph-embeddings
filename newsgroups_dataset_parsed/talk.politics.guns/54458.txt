does
anybody
reading
this
group
have
an
actual
honesttogod
experience
with
violent
crime
in
the
backcountry
to
tell
about
it
was
around
in
the
shenandoah
valley
near
woodstock
virginia
me
my
wife
a
friend
his
wife
and
his
kids
were
hiking
in
a
totally
desolate
mountain
area
all
of
a
sudden
large
rocks
began
raining
down
on
us
looking
up
we
saw
at
least
punks
gleefully
letting
loose
rocks
from
what
was
an
obvious
stash
they
were
a
couple
hundred
feet
above
us
meanwhile
the
women
and
kids
were
screaming
and
running
for
cover
and
the
punks
were
shrieking
with
laughter
me
and
my
friend
yelled
for
them
to
knock
it
off
they
responded
that
we
should
get
fed
me
and
my
friend
drew
our
pistols
and
fired
a
couple
of
times
into
the
trees
above
their
heads
they
ran
with
no
more
pound
rocks
coming
at
our
heads
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
sorry
but
me
and
my
friend
saw
no
need
to
let
it
evolve
to
a
more
violent
level
than
we
were
already
experiencing
i
guess
we
should
have
tried
harder
to
understand
and
cope
with
the
anger
that
society
had
instilled
in
them
and
was
driving
them
to
do
such
things
guess
thats
a
cross
ill
have
to
bear
