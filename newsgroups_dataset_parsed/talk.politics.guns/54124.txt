VINCENT
FOX
SAYS
THIS
MEASURE
AS
IT
WILL
PREVENT
THE
EVIL
BAMBIKILLERS
FROM
HUNTING
AND
ANOTHER
WILL
FIGHT
IT
FOR
THE
INTERFERENCE
WITH
NATURE
THAT
IT
IS
SUCH
A
MEASURE
WOULD
ALSO
HAVE
ANOTHER
BENEFIT
IT
WOULD
RELIEVE
THE
VARIOUS
STATES
OF
THE
THORNY
PROBLEM
OF
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
THE
HUNDREDS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
HUNTERS
POUR
INTO
THE
ECONOMY
ANNUALLY
IM
SURE
THAT
TO
ATTAIN
SURE
A
LOFTY
HUMANE
LIBERAL
AND
ECOLOGICALLY
NOT
TO
MENTION
POLITICALLY
CORRECT
GOAL
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
AND
ANIMAL
RIGHTS
GROUPSINDIVIDUALS
SUPPORTING
SUCH
A
MEASURE
WOULD
BE
MORE
THAN
WILLING
TO
ADD
THEIR
NAMES
TO
A
LIST
OF
SUPPORTERS
SEEKING
INCREASED
TAXATION
TO
REPLACE
THESE
LOST
REVENUES
I
AM
EQUALLY
CONFIDENT
THAT
THESE
SAME
ENTITIES
GIVEN
THEIR
NOTEWORTHY
RECORD
IN
THE
AREA
OF
SOCIAL
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
RESPECT
FOR
PRIVATE
PROPERTY
WOULD
FEEL
MORALLY
AND
ETHICALLY
BOUND
TO
RAISE
THE
NECESSARY
FUNDS
TO
ACQUIRE
THE
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
ACRES
OF
LAND
NOW
HELD
IN
PRIVATE
HANDS
SOLELY
FOR
USE
AS
PRIVATE
HUNTING
PRESERVES
BY
THE
LANDOWNERS
TO
DO
LESS
THAN
THIS
WOULD
PLACE
THESE
SAME
GROUPSINDIVIDUALS
IN
THE
ETHICALLY
UNTENABLE
TO
SAY
NOTHING
OF
ENVIRONMENTALLY
AND
POLITICALLY
INCORRECT
POSITION
OF
SANCTIONING
THE
LOGGING
AND
SUBSEQUENT
DEVELOPMENT
AND
URBANIZATION
OF
THESE
FORMER
PRIVATE
HUNTING
LANDS
WHICH
WOULD
NO
LONGER
BE
USEABLE
BY

OF
ANY
BENEFIT

THE
