HOLLAND
WRITES
WHAT
ABOUT
GUNS
WITH
NONLETHAL
BULLETS
LIKE
RUBBER
OR
PLASTIC
BULLETS
WOULD
THOSE
WORK
VERY
WELL
IN
STOPPING
AN
ATTACK

THE
BRITS
ENOUGH

HAVE
BEEN
KILLED
BY
RUBBER
BULLETS

THEM

ONLY
CERTAIN
CONTROLLED
CIRCUMSTANCES
AND
THEY
ARE
FIRED
FROM
SOMETHING
THAT
LOOKS
LIKE
A
TEAR
GAS
LAUNCHER
THERE
ARE
SMALLER
RUBBER
BULLETS
AND
PELLETS
FOR
SHOTGUNS

UNDERSTAND
THAT
THEY
ARE
ONLY
INTENDED

BE
DISCOURAGERS

WHO
WANTS
YOU
OR
