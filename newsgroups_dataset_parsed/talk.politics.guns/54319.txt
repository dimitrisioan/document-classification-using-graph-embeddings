who
is
next
the
mormons

jews
the
koreshians
rubbed
themselves
out
neither
mormons
nor
jews
have
a
propensity
for
dousing
themselves
with
kerosene
so
im
not
particularly
concerned
or
shall
we
blame
jim
jones
on
the
government
also
i
believe
we
still
remember
masada
where
jews
killed
themselves
rather
than
being
captured
by
the
romans
while
i
do
not
agree
with
the
davidians
i
must
admire
their
willingness
to
die
for
what
they
believed
which

have
had
