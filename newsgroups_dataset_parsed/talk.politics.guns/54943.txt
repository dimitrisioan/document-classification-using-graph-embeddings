A
GUN
IN

NIKOLAUS
MAACK
WRITES
COME
ON
A
GUN
KILLS
PEOPLE
RATHER
PEOPLE
KILL
PEOPLE
WITH
GUNS
THE
SAD
TRUTH
IS
SOMETIMES
THAT
IS
GOOD
OR
AT
LEAST
BETTER
THAN
THE
ALTERNATIVE
BUT
LETS
IGNORE
GUNS
FOR
DEFENCE
ANDOR
CRIME
AND
LOOK
AT
GUN
ACCIDENTS
OK
THERE
ARE
ABOUT
FATAL
FIREARM
ACCIDENTS
PER
YEAR
AND
THE
NUMBER
HAS
BEEN
IN
DECLINE
SINCE
EARLY
THIS
CENTURY
MOST
OF
THESE
ACCIDENTS
INVOLVE
RIFLES
OR
SHOT
GUNS
NOT
HANDGUNS
BUT
SERIOUSLY
A
GUN
IS
DESIGNED
TO
FIRE
A
BULLET
THIS
IS
NOT
SO
YOU
CAN
SHOOT
CARDBOARD
CUT
OUTS
DOWN
AT
THE
RANGE
IN
FACT
THERE
ARE
BOTH
GUNS
AND
BULLETS
DESIGNED
SPECIFICALLY
FOR
THAT
THE
IDEA
THAT
MY
RUGER
MARK
II
BULL
BARREL
A
SEMIAUTO
CALIBER
HANDGUN
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
KILL
OR
HURT
PEOPLE
EVEN
FOR
SELF
DEFENSE
WOULD
IM
SURE
COME
AS
A
SURPRISE
TO
ITS
DESIGNER
IT
CERTAINLY
ISNT
WHY
I
HAVE
IT
IT
CERTAINLY
WOULD
HURT
SOMEONE
IF
YOU
SHOT
THEM
WITH
IT
AND
MIGHT
EVEN
KILL
THEM
BUT
IT
IS
SIMPLY
WRONG
TO
SAY
IT
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
THIS
IS
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
ACT
AS
A
TOOL
FOR
HOME
DEFENCE
WHERE
YOU
SHOW
SOMEONE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
GUN
AND
THEY
GO
GEE
PERHAPS
I
SHOULD
LEAVE
IN
FACT
THAT
IS
WHAT
HAPPENS
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
MOST
SELF
DEFENSIVE
USES
OF
FIREARMS
DONT
INVOLVE
FIRING
ANY
SHOTS
MOST
CRIMINALS
WOULD
PREFER
NOT
TO
BE
SHOT
AND
WILL
GO
TO
SOME
EFFORT
NOT
TO
BE
INCLUDING
DOING
WHAT
YOU
SAY
WHEN
YOU
POINT
A
GUN
AT
THEM
IF
YOU
WERE
CALLED
ON
TO
DESIGN
A
TOOL
THAT
COULD
BE
EASILY
CARRIED
TO
IMMEDIATELY
STOP
SOMEONE
ATTACKING
YOU
WHAT
WOULD
IT
BE
A
HANDGUN
IS
ABOUT
THE
BEST
ANYONE
HAS
COME
UP
WITH
AND
EXPERIENCE
SHOWS
IT
DOES
WORK
THE
NO
YOU
SEE
THE
GUN
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
FIRE
THAT
LITTLE
BULLET
INTO
A
HUMAN
BODY
AND
HURT
THEM
NOT
A
TOUGH
CONCEPT
TO
SWALLOW
FOR
MOST
CERTAINLY
NO
ONE
ARGUES
THAT
HANDGUNS
OF
THE
TYPE
WE
ARE
DISCUSSING
ARENT
DEADLY
WEAPONS
HOWEVER
IT
SIMPLY
ISNT
TRUE
TO
SAY
THAT
ALL
OF
THEM
WERE
DESIGNED
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
MOREOVER
WHAT
EXACTLY
IS
WRONG
WITH
HAVING
DEADLY
WEAPONS
THERE
ARE
TIMES
WHEN
IT
IS
PERFECTLY
LEGITIMATE
TO
USE
DEADLY
FORCE
EG
IN
SELF
DEFENSE
I
CONSIDER
IT
NOT
JUST
MY
RIGHT
BUT
MY
DUTY
TO
DEFEND
MYSELF
AND
MY
FAMILY
AND
THAT
INCLUDES
HAVING
AND
KNOWING
HOW
TO
USE
THE
TOOLS
TO
DO
THAT
THE
STRONGEST
REASON
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
TO
RETAIN
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
IS
AS
A
LAST
RESORT
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
TYRANNY
IN
GOVERNMENT
T
JEFFERSON
I
THINK
WHAT
JEFFERSON
SAID
IS
STILL
TRUE
AND
THE
TROUBLE
WITH
HAVING
SUCH
AN
ITEM
IS
OFTEN
THE
LITTLE
BULLET
GOES
OFF
INTO
THE
WRONG
FLESHY
TARGET
NOT
VERY
OFTEN
COMPARED
TO
OTHER
OR
ELSE
UNCLE
FRANK
GETS
PISSED
AND
BLOWS
AWAY
HIS
WIFE
THIS
ISNT
THAT
COMMON
EITHER
AT
LEAST
WHEN
COMPARED
TO
OTHER
USES
IT
IS
VERY
RARE
THAT
A
NONVIOLENT
PERSON
WILL
SUDDENLY
GETPISSED
AND
KILL
SOMEONE
GUN
OR
NOT
IN
MOST
CASES
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
MURDER
HAVE
LONG
HISTORIES
OF
VIOLENCE
IF
YOU
HAVE
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
WOULDNT
KILL
IF
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
A
GUN
FEEL
FREE
TO
PRESENT
IT
HAVING
A
THING
SPECIFICLY
DESIGNED
TO
KILL
MEANS
IT
IS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
KILL
THINGS
RIGHT
RIGHT
BUT
THERE
ARE
TIMES
WHEN
KILLING
THINGS
IS
CALLED
FOR
I
HOPE
I
NEVER
HAVE
TO
SHOOT
A
PERSON
BUT
IVE
HAD
TO
KILL
A
NUMBER
OF
ANIMALS
FROM
RODENTS
TO
COWS
AND
WHEN
I
DO
I
DONT
WANT
THEM
TO
SUFFER
ANY
MORE
THAN
IS
NECESSARY
I
PREFER
THEY
DIE
INSTANTLY
BUT
FAILING
THAT
I
WANT
THEM
TO
DROP
SO
I
CAN
QUICKLY
FINISH
THEM
WITH
THE
NEXT
SHOT
AND
FAILING
THAT
I
DONT
WANT
THEM
TO
GO
FAST
OR
FAR
I
TRY
TO
CHOOSE
THE
BEST
WEAPON
AND
AMMUNITION
I
HAVE
TO
TRY
TO
ACHIEVE
THAT
GOAL
FOR
THE
SIZE
OF
ANIMAL
IM
AFTER
BUT
IT
DOESNT
ALWAYS
WORK
AS
I
PLAN
WITHOUT
BELABORING
THE
POINT
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
OVERLY
IMPRESSED
WITH
THE
KILLING
OR
SHOPPING
POWER
OF
