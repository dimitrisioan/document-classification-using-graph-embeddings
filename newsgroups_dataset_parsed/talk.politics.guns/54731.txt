RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
ARTICLE
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
ANDYSAILSTANFORDEDU
ANDY
FREEMAN
SAYS
HELL
A
GLOCK
IS
THE
LAST
THING
THAT
SHOULD
BE
SWITCHED
TO
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
I
KNOW
ABOUT
A
GLOCK
IS
THE
LACK
OF
A
REAL
SAFETY
ON
IT
SURE
THERE
IS
THAT
LITTLE
THING
IN
THE
TRIGGER
BUT
THAT
ISNT
TOO
GREAT
OF
A
SAFETY
NOW
WE
KNOW
THAT
KRATZ
DOESNT
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
A
SAFETY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
HE
ALSO
CONFUSES
THINGS
HE
CAN
SEE
WITH
THINGS
THAT
EXIST
GLOCKS
HAVE
MULTIPLE
SAFETIES
EVEN
THOUGH
ONLY
ONE
IS
VISIBLE
FROM
THE
OUTSIDE
EXCUSE
ME
BUT
I
DO
KNOW
WHAT
I
SAFETY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
KRATZ
COMMENTS
ABOVE
SHOW
OTHERWISE
ITS
BASIC
PURPOSE
NOT
TO
LET
THE
GUN
FIRE
UNTIL
YOURE
READY
BINGO
NOW
THE
QUESTION
IS
DOES
THE
GLOCKS
QUALIFY
LETS
SEE
THE
EVIDENCE
THAT
KRATZ
USES
CHRIST
IVE
KNOWN
THAT
SINCE
I
HAD
MY
FIRST
CROSMAN
AIR
GUN
YOU
DONT
KNOW
ME
SO
DONT
MAKE
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
WHAT
I
KNOW
AND
DONT
KNOW
BUT
FIRST
AN
ASIDE
HAVING
AN
AIR
GUN
PROVES
NOTHING
MOREOVER
MY
COMMENTS
ARE
BASED
ON
WHAT
KRATZ
WRITES
HES
FREE
TO
ARGUE
THAT
HE
BABBLES
IN
TEXT
BUT
ACTUALLY
KNOWS
SOMETHING
OFFLINE
A
SAFETY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
KEEP
THE
GUN
FROM
GOING
OFF
UNLESS
THATS
WHAT
THE
USER
WANTS
WITH
GLOCKS
ONE
SAYS
I
WANT
THE
GUN
TO
GO
OFF
BY
PULLING
THE
TRIGGER
IF
THE
SAFETIES
IT
HAS
MAKE
THAT
WORK
IT
HAS
A
REAL
SAFETY
NO
MATTER
WHAT
KRATZ
THINKS
FROM
THE
THINGS
I
HAVE
READHEARD
GLOCKS
ARE
ALWAYS
KNOCKED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
TRIGGER
SAFETY
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSEDLY
HARDER
TO
LEARN
TO
USE
PROPERLY
HARDER
THAN
WHAT
I
NOTE
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
REVOLVERS
WORK
THE
SAME
WAY
SO
IT
CANT
BE
HARDER
THAN
REVOLVERS
EVERY
ARTICLE
THAT
I
HAVE
READ
CANT
BE
WRONG
ABOUT
THE
DAMN
THING
SURE
THEY
CAN
MOREOVER
WE
KNOW
NOW
THAT
KRATZ
SAMPLE
IS
UNREPRESENTATIVE
WE
CAN
LOOK
AT
THE
REASONING
IT
IS
BASICALLY
THESE
GLOCKS
ARE
DANGEROUS
BECAUSE
THEYRE
NOT
LIKE
MY
THIRD
GENERATION
PART
OF
THAT
IS
TRUE
BUT
SINCE
THOSE
SAME
PEOPLE
DONT
CLAIM
THAT
REVOLVERS
WHICH
SHARE
THE
RELEVANT
PROPERTY
ARE
DANGEROUS
WE
SEE
THAT
THE
ARGUMENT
FAILS
ME
TO
QUOTE
MY
SOURCES
BECAUSE
I
DONT
KEEP
A
TON
OF
GUN
MAGAZINES
ANDOR
WHY
WOULD
I
CARE
IM
NOT
LOOKING
FOR
MORE
BOGUS
REASONING
RECGUNS
ARTICLES
LAYING
AROUND
BOY
YOU
CANT
MAKE
A
SIMPLE
STATEMENT
ON
HERE
WITHOUT
SOMEONE
GETTING
RIGHT
ON
YOUR
ASS
ONE
CAN
MAKE
HUNDREDS
OF
SIMPLE
STATEMENTS
WITHOUT
HAVING
ANYONE
GETTING
RIGHT
ON
YOUR
ASS
ONE
MERELY
HAS
TO
MAKE
ACCURATE
SIMPLE
STATEMENTS
THEN
YOU
GET
ATTABOYS
BY
MAIL
AND
PUBLICALLY
ACCURACY
IS
A
SEVERE
BURDEN
BUT
MOST
OF
US
MANAGE
IT
ANDY
