IT
COULD
BE
THAT
THEY
WERE
DETERMINED
TO
STAY
TOGETHER
IN
THE
COMPOUND
NO
MATTER
WHAT
HAPPENED
PERHAPS
THE
FIRE
WAS
ACCIDENTAL
AND
THE

SIMPLY
REFUSED
TO
LEAVE
THE

DIED
FIGHTING

IN

YES
ITS
A
HORRIBLE
WAY
TO
GO
BUT
APPARENTLY
NOT
SO
HORRIBLE
THAT
SOMEONE
WITH
ENOUGH
RELIGIOUS
CONVICTION
MIGHT
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
CARRY
IT
THROUGH
AND
SINCE
THEYVE
DISCOVERED
BULLET
WOUNDS
IN
A
COUPLE
OF
THE
BODIES
FROM
THE

THERE
IS
THE
POSSIBLITY
THAT
THOSE
WITH
THE
WILL
POWER
TO
SELF
IMMOLATE
ALSO
HAD
THE
WILL
POWER
TO
TAKE
OUT
THE
ONES
WHO
HAD
LESS

WAS
