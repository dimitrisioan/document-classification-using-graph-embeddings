writes
massive
dan
blather
mercifully
deleted
his
last
sentence
says
it
all
who
the
hell
are
we
or
the
government
to
judge
their
religion
as
wrong
this
event
i
hope
will
be
recorded
in
history
as
the
american
holocaust
these
people
were
murdered
by
the
us
government
just
as
surely
as
the
jews
were
by
the
nazis
i
hang
my
head
in
shame
for
what
ive
allowed
my
government
to
become
i
have
never
judged
them
by
their
religion
but
by
their
actions
if
they
had
lived
a
quiet
religious
life
as
they
claimed
there
would
have
been
no
raid
no
siege
and
no
deaths
instead
they
chose
courses
of
action
at
every
turn
that
were
at
the
very
least
stupid
if
not
irrational
the
first
was
to
stockpile
weapons
the
second
was
to
shoot
federal
agents
the
third
was
to
stay
inside
last
time
i
checked
amassing
an
arsenal
and
practicing
any
kind
of
religion
were
mentioned
in
passing
in
the
bill
of
rights
guess
its
ok
with
you
if
we
just
brush
em
aside
in
order
to
justify
killing
a
bunch
of
religious
nutcakes
eh
of
all
the
idiots
i
run
into
in
daily
life
dan
your
type
scare
me
the
most
youll
accept
expediency
and
a
cowards
safety
over
any
belief
just
as
long
as
the
government
tells
you
to
you
assume
that
anyone
who
doesnt
comform
to
your
beliefs
and
ways
of
thinking
are
wrong
and
therefore
bad
worse
you
seem
to
accept
without
question
what
the
government
says
is
wrong
to
be
wrong
david
koreshs
religion
was
not
mine
but
then
again
neither
are
the
baptists
methodists
catholics
or
any
of
the
rest
of
the
corporate
religions
but
even
though
koreshs
the
baptists
the
methodists
etc
dont
believe
the
same
way
i
do
i
recognize
that
their
religions
are
equally
valid
to
mine
and
more
importantly
are
equally
protected
under
the
amendment
you
see
im
not
that
much
different
than
koresh
and
i
suspect
many
others
fit
the
same
catagory
i
read
the
bible
many
times
and
as
i
learned
from
it
i
discovered
that
a
lot
of
what
corporate
religions
practice
just
isnt
justified
by
my
interpretation
of
the
bible
therefore
i
go
my
own
way
so
did
koresh
and
neither
you
nor
i
nor
anyone
else
either
individually
or
collectively
as
the
great
socialist
we
has
any
right
whatsoever
to
tell
me
or
you
or
koresh
that
our
religions
are
wrong
you
seem
to
think
that
it
would
have
been
oh
so
easy
for
the
davidians
to
just
forsake
everything
they
believed
in
and
walk
out
of
their
compound
in
order
to
save
themselves
think
if
youre
capable
for
a
moment
about
some
belief
you
hold
dearest
would
you
abandon
that
belief
if
suddenly
told
to
do
so
by
the
government
if
you
would
do
so
you
are
beneath
contempt
lets
assume
you
have
a
belief
that
you
hold
dear
enough
to
commit
your
life
to
do
you
think
it
would
be
the
correct
course
of
action
for
your
government
to
initiate
actions
specifically
designed
to
force
you
to
make
that
forsake
or
die
decision
the
forsake
or
die
option
is
exactly
what
the
government
forced
on
the
davidians
the
day
the
first
wave
of
blackclad
stormtroopers
fired
that
first
shot
and
tossed
that
first
grenade
the
fbi
clenched
it
on
day
when
they
sent
in
heavy
armor
against
men
women
and
children
holed
up
in
a
rickety
old
building
and
armed
with
small
arms
the
people
who
stayed
who
held
to
their
beliefs
over
personal
safety
whose
individual
personal
honors
demanded
they
die
rather
than
submit
who
believed
that
the
bill
of
rights
meant
exactly
what
it
says
to
those
people
go
my
deepest
respect
regardless
of
their
religion
people
like
you
who
blithely
blow
off
the
murder
of
people
with
well
they
could
have
come
out
get
my
most
scornful
contempt
id
spit
in
your
face
were
there
not
a
network
between
us
youre
not
worth
the
ashes
of
those
people
who
