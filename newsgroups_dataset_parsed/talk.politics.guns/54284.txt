OF
THE
IMPENDING
EXECUTION
OF
THE

UNFORTUNATELY
ATF
LOST
THE
ELEMENT
OF
SURPRISE
AND
THE
CULT
WAS
ABLE
TO
ARM
THEMSELVES
AND
PREPARE
FOR
ATFS
ENTRY
INTO
THE

ONCE
A
HOSTAGE
SITUATION
PRESENTED
ITSELF
THE

ASKED
THE

BECOME
INVOLVED
SINCE
THE

IS
SKILLED
IN
HOSTAGE
NEGOTIATIONS

MILITARY
TANKS
WERE
