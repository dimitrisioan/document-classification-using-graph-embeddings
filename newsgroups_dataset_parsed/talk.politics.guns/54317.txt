move
all
postings
about
waco
and
burn
to
guess
where
stop
posting
on
this
newsgroup
we
are
all
so
glad
youre
trying
to
save
us
from
the
evil
goverment
but
would
you
mail
this
in
regular
mail
to
lets
say
people
thomas
parsli
and
everybody
who
talked
about
the
evil
arising
in
europe
was
labeled
reactionary
in
the
late
after
all
we
could
negotiate
with
hitler
and
trust
him
to
keep
his
end
of
the
bargain
at
least
thats
what
stalin
and
chamberlin
thought
i
guess
they
forgot
to
teach
you
about
your
country
being
overrun
by
the
germans
in
wwii
eh
thomas
and
im
sorry
you
consider
outrage
at
government
excesses
to
be
everytime
the
israelis
conduct
a
mass
operation
against
a
terrorist
group
that
is
actively
killing
their
citizens
and
soldiers
the
world
gets
indignant
but
its
ok
for
the
us
to
assault
its
own
citizens
who
were
a
religous
minority
and
accused
of
sexual
deviation
and
hoarding
weapons
i
find
it
real
ironic
this
happened
the
same
day
al
gore
arrived
in
poland
to
recognize
the
sacrifices
made
in
the
warsaw
ghetto
where
the
same
justifications
were
raised
for
an
armed
assault
by
blackclad
troops
with
armor
support
james
s
cochrane
when
in
danger
or
in
doubt
run
in
this
space
circles
scream
and
shout
for
rent
