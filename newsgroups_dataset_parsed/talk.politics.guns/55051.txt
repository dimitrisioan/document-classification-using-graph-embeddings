cnn
just
reported
the
atf
and
the
fbi
have
begun
killing
everyone
in
the
united
states
a
press
release
stated
this
action
was
required
because
bugs
had
revealed
that
many
people
were
doing
something
illegal
in
their
homes
and
statistical
data
indicated
that
those
who
werent
might
someday
do
something
illegal
an
atf
spokesperson
just
before
he
shot
himself
stated
that
this
would
clean
up
things
once
and
for
all
for
those
of
you
still
unsure
whether
this
is
satire
the
jury
is
still
out
also
yesterday
even
though
the
compound
no
longer
exists
the
us
attorneys
office
here
released
formerly
sealed
documents
including
a
search
warrant
and
related
affidavits
that
authorities
planned
to
use
when
the
siege
was
over
these
documents
did
not
include
the
original
warrants
the
bureau
of
alcohol
tobacco
and
firearms
had
in
late
february
which
to
this
day
have
never
been
released
one
of
the
documents
indicated
the
agency
planned
to
seek
samples
of
koreshs
handwriting
not
only
to
verify
that
he
had
signed
for
some
gun
purchases
but
also
that
he
espoused
certain
doctrines
hostile
to
law
enforcement
and
particularly
the
atf
so
one
of
the
charges
against
koresh
seems
to
be
contempt
of
cop
he
expressed
hostility
to
the
batf
that
chilly
feeling
in
your
gonads
is
perfectly
normal
folks
it
should
go
away
in
about
days
the
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
the
lazy
dog
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
that
should
save
them
the
trouble
of
subpoenaing
samples
heavens
knows
i
want
to
cooperate
