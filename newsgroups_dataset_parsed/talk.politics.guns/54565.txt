note
that
bo
gritz
was
on
the
populist
party
ticket
with
david
duke
for
veep
in
until
he
found
out
that
duke
was
leading
he
ticket
when
he
withdrew
his
candidacy
thats
a
revisionist
account
of
what
happened
gritz
was
wellaware
of
dukes
presence
on
the
ticket
given
that
gritz
is
not
at
all
shy
about
associating
and
promoting
other
white
supremacists
such
as
the
christian
identity
movement
or
willis
carto
whatever
reasons
gritz
had
to
leave
the
ticket
had
nothing
to
do
with
dukes
presence
so
gritz
gave
up
his
chance
to
be
vice
president
of
the
us
just
to
aviod
supporting
duke
id
hardly
call
that
giving
up
his
chance
to
be
vice
president
of
the
us
the
chance
of
the
populist
party
ticket
winning
is
essentially
nil
still
it
does
imply
that
he
doesnt
want
to
be
associated
with
duke
i
believe
chip
berlet
has
a
populist
party
newsletter
from
the
time
with
a
photo
of
gritz
happily
shaking
hands
with
