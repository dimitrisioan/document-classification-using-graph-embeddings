THE

FINDS
THAT
THE

OF

A
THREAT
TO
THE

NOW
I
SUPPOSE
THE

IS
WITHIN
ITS

TO
REFUSE
SUCH

HOWEVER
THE
SECOND
SENTENCE
IS
SO
NOXIOUS
I
FEEL
COMPELLED
TO
BRING
IT
TO
THE
ATTENTION
OF
THE
TPGCG
READERSHIP
I
CALLED

I
APPRECIATE
THE
THOUGHTFULLNESS
OF

TO
NOT

FOR
SUCH

THE
RIGHT
TO

IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
MISAPPLIED
RIGHTS
IN
OUR
CONSTITUTION
AND
ASSAULT

GO
WAY
BEYOND
WHAT

OR
RATHER

BE
IMHO
A
NATURAL
RIGHT
IN

JUST
ASK
