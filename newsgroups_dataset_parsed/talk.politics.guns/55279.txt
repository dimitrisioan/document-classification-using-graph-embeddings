came
across
the
following
notice
in

this
morning
april
beginquote
notice
the
denver
post
will
no
longer
knowingly
accept
any
advertisement
to
buy
or
sell
assault
weapons
the
denver
post
finds
that
the
use
of
assault
weapons
poses
a
threat
to
the
health
safety
and
security
of
its
reader
endquote
now
i
suppose
the
post
is
within
its
rights
to
refuse
such
ads
however
the
second
sentence
is
so
noxious
i
feel
compelled
to
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
tpgcg
readership
i
called
the
post
classified
number
and
expressed
my
displeas
re
according
to
the
supervisor
i
spoke
to
the
post
was
reacting
to
public
complaints
regarding
the
running
of
assult
weapon
ads
however
she
sai
the
paper
was
keeping
track
of
the
reaction
to
the
change
in
policy
i
strongly
encourage
denver
post
readers
to
call
and
make
their
feelings

boulder
colorado
will
do
i
appreciate
the
thoughtfullness
of
the
post
to
not
be
an
intermediary
for
such
sales
the
right
to
bear
arms
is
one
of
the
most
misapplied
rights
in
our
constitution
and
assault
weapons
go
way
beyond
what
is
or
rather
should
be
imho
a
natural
right
in
america
just
ask
the
family
of
that
boy
shot
back
in
september
the
papers
are
full
of
stories
about
a
child
with
an
assult
weapon
with
a
angelic
face
post
who
committed
the
murder
without
ever
thinking
this
has
all
got
to
get
under
control
i
applaud
the
post
for
their
bravery
