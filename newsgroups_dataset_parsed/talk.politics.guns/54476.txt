no
they
didnt

electrical
power
but
no
i
dont
find
the
idea
of
davidians
calmly
cooking
lunch
with
gas
masks
on
as
the
fbi
knocks
the
buildings
down
very
credibleeither
i
dont
know
how
quickly
you
can
get
a
woodstove
to
heat
up
from
a
cold
start
but
mine
takes
about
three
hours
its
not
like
this
whole
discussion
is
relevant
it
started
when
some
one
made
the
wholly
unsubstantiated
allegation
that
the
wood
stove
ig
nited
napalm
the
fbi
shot
into
the
buildings
mox
nix
the
bds
were
prepared
to
provide
their
own
heat
and
light
and
were
doing
so
for
weeks
while
the
power
was
out
that
means
the
compound
contained
containers
of
flammable
liquids
or
gases
that
could
be
busted
by
a
tank
intrusion
plus
ignition
sources
which
no
one
can
tell
for
sure
were
all
off
at
the
time
im
not
a
groveling
apoligist
for
the
feds
far
from
it
but
wild
ac
cusations
like
this
are
ridiculous
and
obfuscate
legitimate
criticism
of
their
conduct
in
this
whole
affair
on
the
contrary
we
are
proposing
alternate
scenarios
the
people
who
are
coming
to
wild
conclusions
are
the
feds
who
are
absolutely
positive
how
the
fire
started
even
though
none
of
them
were
in
a
position
to
see
it
either
and
the
stories
they
hear
from
their
prisoners
