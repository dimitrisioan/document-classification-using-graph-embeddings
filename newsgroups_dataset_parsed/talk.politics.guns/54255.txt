RE
MY
GUN
IS
LIKE
MY
AMERICAN
EXPRESS
CARD
IN
JASON
KRATZ
WRITES
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
HAPPENING
HERE
IS
THE
SITUATION
GETTING
TOTALLY
BLOWN
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
IN
MY
POST
I
WAS
REFERRING
TO
YOUR
REGULAR
PATROLMAN
IN
A
CAR
CRUISING
AROUND
THE
CITY
VS
GANG
MEMBERS
OF
COURSE
THE
POLICE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
THINGS
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
BUT
DO
THEY
USE
TANKS
AND
SUCH
ALL
OF
THE
TIME
OF
COURSE
THEY
DONT
AND
THATS
THE
POINT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
EVERY
DAY
WHEN
I
GO
OUT
TO
LUNCH
I
ALWAYS
SEE
COPS
COMING
IN
THE
MAJORITY
THAT
I
SEE
ARE
STILL
CARRYING
REVOLVERS
SO
LOOK
IN
THE
TRUNK
SOME
TIME
HECK
LOOK
AT
THE
DASH
THAT
FUNNY
THING
ATTACHED
WITH
A
QUICKRELEASE
IS
A
GUN
THE
ONES
IN
THE
TRUNK
ARE
BETTER
I
DONT
HAVE
NUMBERS
FOR
CHICAGO
BUT
PHILADELPHIA
POLICE
CARS
CARRIED
MULTIPLE
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
AND
THOUSANDS
OF
ROUNDS
AS
STANDARD
ISSUE
IN
THE
NOT
THAT
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
WRONG
WITH
A
REVOLVER
BUT
IF
YOURE
A
COP
THAT
IS
UP
AGAINST
SOME
GANG
MEMBER
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
AUTOMATICS
IN
HIS
COAT
I
MEAN
SEMIAUTO
HANDGUNS
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
EVEN
WITH
TRAINING
WHAT
IS
THE
NATURE
OF
THIS
DISADVANTAGE
IF
THE
COP
CAN
SHOOT
ROUNDS
WILL
DO
THE
JOB
AGAINST
A
SINGLE
OPPONENT
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
THE
COP
HAS
GUARANTEED
BACKUP
IF
THE
GANG
MEMBER
CAN
SHOOT
THE
EXTRA
ROUNDS
DONT
HELP
THE
ONLY
TIME
THIS
DIFFERENCE
CAN
MATTER
IS
IF
NEITHER
CAN
SHOOT
AND
COPS
ARENT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THROWING
LEAD
AROUND
LIKE
THAT
BTW
MOST
COPS
CARRY
MULTIPLE
GUNS
YOURE
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
SECOND
THIRD
AND
SO
ON
I
HAVE
BEEN
AT
A
SHOOTING
RANGE
WHERE
GANG
MEMBERS
WERE
PRACTICING
SHOOTING
HOW
DO
WE
KNOW
THAT
THEY
WERE
GANG
MEMBERS
AND
NOT
UNDERCOVER
COPS
OR
EVEN
LAWABIDING
MENACING
MINORITIES
BTW
WHY
THE
SNEER
QUOTES
THEY
WERE
ACTUALLY
PRACTICING
TAKING
OUT
THEIR
GUNS
AS
QUICK
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
SHOOTING
AT
THE
TARGET
AND
THEY
WERENT
DOING
TOO
BADLY
EITHER
THEN
THE
EXTRA
ROUNDS
WONT
MAKE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
SO
WHY
IS
IT
AN
ISSUE
ANDY
