id
be
willing
to
go
in
as
well
by
the
way
we
wouldnt
need
to
buy
the
network
wholesale
simply
owning
a
large
number
of
shares
would
still
work
if
of
the
shareholders
want
progun
coverage
and
the
rest
dont
really
care
theyll
go
along
just
to
keep
the
happy
id
go
along
with
this
plan
as
well
turners
stock
is
traded
on
the
american
exchange
and
has
classes
a
b
and
c
a
and
b
stock
is
currently
about
bucks
a
share
c
stock
is
about
bucks
a
share
does
anybody
have
any
idea
how
much
stock
tbs
has
issued
what
would
it
take
to
reach
or
even
um
i
sortof
hesitate
to
bring
this
up
but
owning
even
a
single
share
entitles
you
to
attend
the
annual
shareholders
meeting
and
under
most
corporate
charters
to
introduce
topics
to
be
discussed
while
i
dont
suggest
the
tactic
used
by
some
in
japan
go
to
the
shareholders
meeting
and
disrupt
the
bejeezus
out
of
everything
what
about
a
wellworded
resolution
complaining
about
advocacy
