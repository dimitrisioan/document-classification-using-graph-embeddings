GUY
M
TROTTER
WRITES
HI
IN
CANADA
ANY
GUN
THAT
ENTERS
A
NATIONAL
PARK
MUST
BE
SEALED
I
THINK
ITS
A
SMALL
METAL
TAG
THATS
PLACED
OVER
THE
TRIGGER
THE
NET
RESULT
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
YOU
CANT
USE
A
GUN
TO
PROTECT
YOURSELF
FROM
BEARS
OR
PSYCHOS
IN
THE
NATIONAL
PARKS
INSTEAD
ONE
HAS
TO
BE
SENSITIVE
TO
THE
DANGERS
AND
ANNOYANCES
OF
HIKING
IN
BEAR
COUNTRY
AND
TAKE
THE
APPROPRIATE
PRECAUTIONS
I
THINK
THIS
POLICY
MAKES
THE
USERS
OF
THE
NATIONAL
PARKS
FEEL
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
TO
NATURE
THAT
THEY
ARE
A
PART
OF
NATURE
AND
AS
SUCH
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
NATURE
ON
ITS
OWN
TERMS
GUY
HELLO
I
UNDERSTAND
THIS
PHILOSOPHY
THE
BEARS
ARE
A
NATIONAL
TREASURE
THE
AREA
IS
THEIR
SANCTUARY
AND
PEOPLE
WHO
ENTER
IT
DO
SO
AT
THEIR
OWN
RISK
IT
IS
BETTER
THAT
THAT
RARE
HUMAN
BE
KILLED
BY
A
BEAR
THAN
THAT
BEARS
BE
PROVOKED
OR
SHOT
BY
UNBEARSAVVY
VISITORS
THE
BEARS
ARENT
HAVING
A
POPULATION
EXPLOSION
HUMANS
ARE
SO
IT
IS
BETTER
THAT
A
HUMAN
BE
KILLED
THAN
ENDANGER
THE
BEARS
I
DONT
AGREE
WITH
THIS
PHILOSOPY
BUT
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
THE
PSYCHOS
ARE
A
BIT
DIFFERENT
THEY
ARE
NOT
A
NATIONAL
TREASURE
BUT
I
SUPPOSE
THE
DECISION
HAS
BEEN
MADE
THAT
TO
ALLOW
PROVISION
FOR
DEFENSE
AGAINST
THEM
WOULD
ALSO
ALLOW
PROVISION
FOR
DEFENSE
AGAINST
BEARS
AGAIN
I
SUPPOSE
IT
HAS
BEEN
DECIDED
THAT
IT
IS
BETTER
FOR
THE
RARE
HUMAN
TO
BE
KILLED
BY
A
PSYCHO
THAN
TO
TAKE
A
CHANCE
ON
THREATENING
THE
BEARS
PERSONALLY
I
WOULDNT
GO
INTO
AN
AREA
WHERE
I
WOULD
BE
MANAGED
SO
AS
TO
REDUCE
MY
SAFETY
BUT
COME
TO
THINK
OF
IT
I
GUESS
I
LIVE
IN
A
MANAGED
WILDERNESS
MYSELF
