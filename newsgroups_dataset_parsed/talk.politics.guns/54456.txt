AS
FAR
AS
JOHN
Q
PUBLIC
WITH
A
GUN
THE
SUPREME
COURT
HAS
ALREADY
RULED
IN
CASES
SUCH
AS
US
V
MILLER
US
AND
US
V
VERDUGOURQUIDEZ
S
CT
THAT
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
AMENDMENT
PROTECTS
THIS
INTERPRETATION
CAN
BE
FOUND
AS
FAR
BACK
AS
THE
DRED
SCOTT
CASE
IN
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
US
VS
MILLER
SUSTAINED
MILLERS
CONVICTION
OF
POSSESSION
OF
AN
ILLEGAL
FIREARM
NOTING
THAT
A
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUN
WAS
NOT
A
PROPER
MILITIA
WEAPON
NO
THEY
NOTED
THAT
NO
ONE
HAD
CLAIMED
THAT
IT
WAS
A
PROPER
MILITIA
WEAPON
DESPITE
HAVING
BEEN
USED
IN
AT
LEAST
TWO
WARS
THIS
WAS
TRUE
SINCE
NEITHER
MILLER
NOR
HIS
LAWYER
APPEARED
BEFORE
THE
COURT
DID
THEY
OR
DID
THEY
NOT
SUSTAIN
MILLERS
CONVICTION
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
TEXT
OF
THE
CASE
HANDY
YES
SHOTGUNS
HAD
BEEN
USED
IN
WWI
THE
SPANISHAMERICAN
WAR
AND
THE
US
CIVIL
WAR
THAT
WAS
NOT
IN
QUESTION
THE
POSSESSION
OF
A
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUN
WAS
IE
A
WEAPON
ALTERED
TO
IMPROVE
CONCEALIBILITY
THEREFORE
US
VS
MILLER
SUPPORTS
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
OF
FIREARMS
DONT
GO
ARGUING
DOWN
THIS
ROAD
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
WILLING
TO
ABIDE
BY
THE
CONSEQUENCES
THAT
YOU
FIND
AT
THE
END
OF
IT
MAINLY
THAT
THE
LAWABIDING
COMMON
MAN
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
OWN
ANY
WEAPON
THAT
HAS
A
MILITIA
PURPOSE
FROM
HANDGUNS
TO
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUNS
AND
FULLY
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
THAT
IN
FACT
IS
WHAT
THIS
DECISION
SAYS
YOU
ARE
FREE
TO
PRODUCE
EVIDENCE
THAT
IM
NOT
WILLING
TO
ABIDE
WITH
ALL
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THIS
JUST
BECAUSE
I
DONT
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
ENDORSE
THE
NRA
POSITION
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
I
OPPOSE
THE
RKBA
THIS
ATTITUDE
IS
WHAT
MAKES
THE
NRA
UNPOPULAR
