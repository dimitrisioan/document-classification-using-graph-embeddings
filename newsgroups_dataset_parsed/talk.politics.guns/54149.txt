FIREARMS
TEND
TO
FALL
INTO
THIS
LOW
DOLLARPOUND
AREA
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
ECONOMIC
TO
SMUGGLE
THEM
IN
ALL
PRODUCTION
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE

THERE
ARE
NOT
ALL
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BOTH
THE

AND

TO
ASSEMBLE
WORTHWHILE

FROM

HIGHRANKING
CRIME
FIGURES
COULD
OBTAIN
IMPORTED
UZIS
AND
SUCH
BUT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
AND
AVERAGE
THUG
WOULD
BE
LUCKY
TO
GET
A
ZIPGUN
AND
WOULD
PAY
THROUGH
THE
NOSE
FOR
IT
THIS
IS
NOT
BORNE
OUT
OF
REALITY
THE
OLD
SOVIET
UNION
HAD
A
VERY
SERIOUS
DOMESTIC
HANDGUN
AND
SUBMACHINEGUN
TRADE
GUNS
THAT
WERE
OF
COMMERCIAL
GRADE
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE

IN

MACHINESHOPS
WHY
WOULD
ALL

HAVE
TO

DONT
WE
HAVE
A

SYSTEM
THAT
IS
THE
ENVY
OF
THE

I
SEEM
TO
RECALL

MAY
HAVE

THAT
YEARS

ANY

WITH
HIGHSCHOOL

COULD
PRODUCE
A

YOU
TALK
ABOUT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
NOT

ABLE
GET
EVEN
A

WELL
NOW
THINK
OF
ALL
THAT
PRIVATE
CNC
CONTROLLED
MACHINERY
THAT
IS
NOT
BEING
USED
FOR
SHIFTS
A
DAY
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
IF

WERE
BEING
SOLD
ON
THE
BLACK
MARKET
FOR
SAY
AN
ENTERPRISING
MECHANICAL
ENGINEER
COULD
BE
USING
THAT
MACHINERY
TO
PRODUCE
WORKABLE
SUBMACHINEGUNS
FOR

AFTER
ALL

HAD
AN
ARTICLE
AND
PICTURES
ON
HOW
BATF
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
THE
MANUFACTURER
OF
QUITE
EFFICIENT
SILENCERS
THAT
WERE
OF

QUALITY
AND
FINISH
LOOK
AT
IT
THIS
WAY
OF
THE
US
HOUSEHOLDS
HAVE
A
HANDGUN
SAY
AT

HALF
OF
THOSE
KEEP
ONE
FOR
SELFDEFENSE
YOU
ARE
TALKING
A
POTENTIAL
MARKET
OF
OF
TENS
OF
MILLIONS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
WOULD
SEEK
FIREARMS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
SELFPRESERVATION
ONLY
A
FOOL
WOULD
BELIEVE
THAT

WOULD
NOT
BE
FILLED
