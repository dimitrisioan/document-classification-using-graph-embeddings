re
ban
all
firearms
firearms
tend
to
fall
into
this
low
dollarpound
area
it
would
not
be
economic
to
smuggle
them
in
all
production
would
have
to
be
local
there
are
not
all
that
many
people
who
have
both
the
skill
and
motivation
to
assemble
worthwhile
firearms
from
scratch
highranking
crime
figures
could
obtain
imported
uzis
and
such
but
the
average
person
and
average
thug
would
be
lucky
to
get
a
zipgun
and
would
pay
through
the
nose
for
it
this
is
not
borne
out
of
reality
the
old
soviet
union
had
a
very
serious
domestic
handgun
and
submachinegun
trade
guns
that
were
of
commercial
grade
because
they
were
produced
in
honesttogoodness
machineshops
why
would
all
production
have
to
be
local
dont
we
have
a
road
system
that
is
the
envy
of
the
world
i
seem
to
recall
incidents
in
the
past
where
chinese
entreprenaurs
attempted
to
smuggle
semiautos
into
this
country
to
get
around
import
number
limitations
may
have
been
gunweek
where
i
read
that
years
ago
any
person
with
highschool
drafting
skills
and
vocational
school
machineshop
training
could
produce
a
submachinegun
you
talk
about
the
average
person
not
being
able
get
even
a
zipgun
well
now
think
of
all
that
private
cnc
controlled
machinery
that
is
not
being
used
for
shifts
a
day
do
you
think
that
if
guns
were
being
sold
on
the
black
market
for
say
an
enterprising
mechanical
engineer
could
be
using
that
machinery
to
produce
workable
submachineguns
for
sale
after
all
gunweek
had
an
article
and
pictures
on
how
batf
was
looking
for
the
manufacturer
of
quite
efficient
silencers
that
were
of
commercial
quality
and
finish
look
at
it
this
way
of
the
us
households
have
a
handgun
say
at
least
half
of
those
keep
one
for
selfdefense
you
are
talking
a
potential
market
of
of
tens
of
millions
of
people
who
would
seek
firearms
for
the
purpose
of
selfpreservation
only
a
fool
would
believe
that
market
would
not
be
filled
regardless
of
government
prohibitions
