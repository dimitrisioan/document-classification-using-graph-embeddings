MILITIA
BEING
NECESSARY
TO
THE
SECURITY
OF
THE
FREE
STATE
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE

SHALL
NOT
BE
INFRINGED
I
KNOW
THAT
AS
A
CANADIAN
I
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
TO
STAND
ON
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
TO
MAINTAINING
A
FREE
SOCIETY
THE
AMERICA
IS
STILL
THE
MOST
ENVIABLE
PLACE
TO
LIVE
ON
THIS
EARTH
BY
ANYONE
WITH
THEIR
HEAD
ON
STRAIGHT
AND
WILL
STAY
THAT
WAY
ONLY
IF
MORE
PEOPLE
STANDUP
PUBLICLY
FOR
WHAT
THEY
BELIEVE
REMEMBER
THAT
IF
YOU
STAND
FOR
NOTHING
