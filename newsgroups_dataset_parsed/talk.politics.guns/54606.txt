RE
EFFECTIVENESS
CALIBRE
AD
ABSURDUM
PER
ASPERA
WRITES
FROM
PSCSEICMUEDU
PETER
CAPELL
ON
RECMARTIALARTS
IM
SURE
SUCH
WEAPONS
HAVE
BEEN
DEVELOPED
OUR
SOCIETY
DOES
NOT
HOWEVER
CONDONE
THEIR
POSSESSION
OR
USE
ACTUALLY
JOE
I
WROTE
THE
ABOVE
PETER
WAS
RESPONDING
TO
MY
ARTICLE
IM
ACTUALLY
RATHER
CONFUSED
BY
YOUR
POST
I
SUPPOSE
I
DIDNT
MAKE
MYSELF
CLEAR
CAUSE
YOU
SEEM
TO
HAVE
GOTTEN
EXACTLY
THE
OPPOSITE
IMPRESSION
FROM
WHAT
I
INTENDED
I
SUPPOSE
THE
AUTHORITIES
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
A
BETTER
TERM
THAN
SOCIETY
CARRY
AND
USE
A
FIREARM
IN
MANY
PARTS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
CERTAINLY
THE
PARTS
I
LIVE
IN
AND
EXPECT
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
TO
HAVE
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
EXPLAINING
TO
DO
AND
THERE
IS
ALSO
APPEARS
TO
BE
A
TREND
IN
SOCIETY
AT
LARGE
THAT
ACTIVELY
OPPOSES
WHAT
MANY
SEE
AS
THEIR
RIGHT
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
IN
A
FEW
OTHER
PARTS
OF
OUR
SOCIETY
HANDGUNS
ARE
BANNED
OR
SO
RESTRICTED
AS
TO
BE
PRACTICALLY
UNAVAILABLE
TO
THE
LAW
ABIDING
CITIZEN
FOR
SELFDEFENSE
OUTSIDE
THE
HOME
FUNNY
THOUGH
HOW
THE
CRIMINALS
IN
SUCH
PLACES
CONTINUE
TO
HAVE
A
LUSH
SUPPLY
OF
GUNS
AND
NO
COMPUNCTIONS
ABOUT
USING
THEM
IMHO
YOU
DONT
NEED
TO
BE
EITHER
A
POLITICAL
PHILOSOPHER
OR
A
CRIME
VICTIM
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THERES
A
FLAW
IN
THE
GUN
GRABBERS
LOGIC
AGREED
YOURE
WELCOME
TO
YOUR
HO
TOO
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
BEING
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
THE
SECOND
BUT
PLEASE
DONT
LET
YOUR
OBVIOUS
GOOD
INTENTIONS
BE
SUBVERTED
BY
INSUPPORTABLE
GENERALITIES
ABOUT
SOMETHING
AS
BIG
AND
DIVERSE
AS
US
SOCIETY
MY
ONLY
INTENTION
WAS
TO
COMMENT
THAT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SUITABLE
WEAPONS
OF
SELF
DEFENSE
DOESNT
MEAN
YOULL
ESCAPE
A
WHOLE
SHITLOAD
OF
TROUBLE
SHOULD
YOU
BE
FORCED
TO
USE
THEM
OR
BY
THE
NAIVE
HOPE
THAT
MAKING
GUN
POSSESSION
A
CRIME
WILL
GIVE
PAUSE
TO
SOMEONE
WHO
WOULD
BE
A
CRIMINAL
ANYWAY
I
MADE
NO
SUCH
STATEMENTS
NOR
DO
I
HAVE
SUCH
A
NAIVE
HOPE
OR
OUTLOOK
WISHING
YOU
PEACE
AND
THE
WHEREWITHAL
TO
DEFEND
YOURSELF
IF
OTHERS
THOUGHTS
ARE
NOT
THAT
KINDLY
THATS
ALL
I
WANT
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
LEAVE
IN
PEACE
OR
TO
HAVE
THE
MEANS
TO
DEFEND
MYSELF
WHEN
THAT
IN
NOT
POSSIBLE
I
THINK
WE
AGREE
ON
THIS
ISSUE
I
GUESS
MY
POSITION
DIDNT
SURVIVE
THE
TRANSITION
FROM
COGNITION
TO
ASCII
GARRY

A
SLOW
