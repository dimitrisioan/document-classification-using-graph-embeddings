RE
AMENDMENT
DEAD
GOOD
FROM
ARTICLE
BY
JRMGNVIFASUFLEDU
YEA
THERE
ARE
MILLIONS
OF
CASES
WHERE
YOY
SAY
THAT
FIREARMS
DETER
CRIMINALS
ALAS
THIS
IS
NOT
PROVABLE
I
THINK
THAT
THAT
THERE
ARE
ACTUALLY
FEW
CASES
WHERE
THIS
IS
SO
IT
CERTAINLY
IS
PROVABLE
AROUND
A
MILLION
AMERICANS
EVERY
YEAR
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
WITH
FIREARMS
IN
MANY
OF
THESE
CASES
THE
DEFENDER
DOESNT
EVEN
HAVE
TO
FIRE
A
SHOT
THE
MERE
PRESENCE
OF
A
GUN
IS
OFTENTIMES
ALL
THE
DETERRENT
THAT
IS
NEEDED
I
DONT
LIKE
VIOLENCE
ANYMORE
THAN
ANYONE
ELSE
DOES
BUT
TAKING
AWAY
THE
RIGHT
OF
AMERICANS
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
IS
NOT
THE
SOLUTION
TO
THE
VIOLENT
CRIME
PROBLEM
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
IF
HONEST
LAWABIDING
CITIZENS
ARE
UNABLE
TO
GET
FIREARMS
THEN
THEY
WILL
BE
PREYED
ON
EVEN
MORE
BY
CRIMINALS
WHO
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
ACQUIRE
GUNS
THROUGH
ILLEGAL
CHANNELS
EXPECT
TO
START
SEEING
THE
CRIME
SYNDICATES
WHO
SMUGGLE
DRUGS
INTO
THIS
COUNTRY
START
SMUGGLING
GUNS
BELIEVE
ME
THIS
WILL
HAPPEN
THERE
IS
PLENTY
OF
ECONOMIC
INCENTIVE
FOR
GANGSTERS
TO
ILLEGALY
IMPORT
GUNS
INTO
THIS
COUNTRY
IF
GUNS
SHOULD
BE
BANNED
BY
THE
KLINTONISTAS
THE
BULK
OF
FIRAREMS
ARE
USED
AGAINST
UNWORTHY
AND
UNNESESSARY
OPPONENTS
THOSE
WHO
POSESSA
A
COOL
JAKCET
YOU
WANT
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
ARGUE
WITH
YOU
ABOUT
A
PARKING
SPACE
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
TAKE
YOUR
WOMAN
IN
SHORT
TRIVIAL
AND
WORTHLESS
CAUSES
STATISTICS
POR
FAVOR
TOO
MUCH
OF
THIS
HAS
RUINED
YOU
CAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
RECOVERY
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
FEDERAL
MARTIALS
WILL
COME
FOR
YOUR
ARMS
NO
ONE
WILL
HELP
YOU
YOU
ARE
MORE
DANGEROUS
TO
THEIR
THINKING
THAN
THE
CRIMINAL
THIS
IS
YOUR
OWN
FAULT
SEE
MY
PREVIOUS
POST
THAT
OUGHT
TO
SET
YOU
STRAIGHT
THE
AMENDMENT
IS
DEAD
ACCEPT
THIS
FIND
ANOTHER
WAY
PEOPLE
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
CONSTITUTION
SAYS
THAT
MEANS
THAT
EVEN
IF
THE
AMENDMENT
IS
REPEALED
THE
PEOPLE
THATS
ALL
AMERICAN
CITIZENS
FYI
WILL
STILL
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
SCOTT
