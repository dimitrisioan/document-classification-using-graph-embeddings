ANDY
FREEMAN
SAYS
CLUE
KRATZ
POSITION
ISNT
A
DEFENSE
AGAINST
INACCURACY
I
OPPOSE
GUN
CONTROL
BECAUSE
IT
DOESNT
WORK
IF
IT
DID
ID
SUPPORT
IT
IN
FACT
I
SUPPORTED
GUN
CONTROL
BEFORE
I
DID
MY
HOMEWORK
THERES
NO
DEMAND
FOR
PROGUN
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THEYRE
TALKING
ABOUT
IN
FACT
THEYD
BE
MUCH
BETTER
OFF
IF
THEY
DIDNT
SAY
ANYTHING
AND
WHY
IS
THIS
FREEMAN
EVEN
IF
A
PROGUN
PERSON
DOESNT
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THEY
WILL
LEARN
A
THING
OR
TWO
I
AM
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
POST
EVEN
IF
PEOPLE
GET
ANGRY
WITH
WHAT
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
I
HAVE
SEVERAL
GOOD
SOURCES
OF
MATERIAL
NOW
THAT
I
KNOW
WHERE
TO
LOOK
SO
CALM
DOWN
THERES
LOTS
OF
INFORMATION
FLOWING
ON
TPG
FOR
THOSE
INTERESTED
IN
LEARNING
ONE
CAN
PARTICIPATE
IN
THOSE
DISCUSSIONS
WITHOUT
RANTING
INACCURATELY
FAILURE
TO
DO
SO
HAS
CONSEQUENCES
AH
FREEMAN
SEEMS
TO
FORGET
FROM
MY
STATEMENT
THAT
I
AM
LEARNING
I
HAVE
ALSO
ASKED
SEVERAL
OF
THE
NOTSOHOSTILE
FOLKS
ON
THIS
GROUP
FOR
SOURCES
OF
INFORMATION
TO
READ
DO
YOU
THINK
FREEMAN
THAT
MAYBE
THIS
MEANS
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
LEARNING
I
THINK
IT
DOES
BECAUSE
AS
YOU
SAID
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
KNOW
ANYTHING
WONT
BE
GOOD
FOR
THE
PROGUN
CAUSE
ANOTHER
GOOD
HABIT
TO
GET
INTO
IS
TO
GO
READONLY
FOR
A
WHILE
TO
TAKE
THE
TIME
TO
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
THINGS
WORK
ANOTHER
GOOD
HABIT
TO
GET
INTO
IS
TO
REALIZE
THAT
NOT
EVERYONE
IS
YOU
FREEMAN
AND
ACCEPT
MISTAKES
SURE
MAYBE
IT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
SOME
TYPE
OF
MISINFORMATION
BEING
SLUNG
BY
SOME
ANTIGUN
NUT
BUT
IT
WASNT
I
MADE
MY
STATEMENT
TO
INFORM
EVERYONE
OF
THIS
AND
EVERYONE
WHO
REPLIED
SAID
DONT
WORRY
ABOUT
IT
BUT
ALSO
TO
LEARN
AS
MUCH
AS
YOU
CAN
THEY
ACCEPTED
MY
MISTAKE
AND
GAVE
ME
SOURCES
OF
INFORMATION
AND
TOLD
ME
TO
READ
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
I
HAVE
READ
SEVERAL
POSTS
OF
YOURS
AND
HAVE
FOUND
THEM
INFORMATIVE
WHY
DONT
YOU
GIVE
ME
THE
SAME
CHANCE
