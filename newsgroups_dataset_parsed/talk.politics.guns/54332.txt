HUMANS
WHO
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
DIED
IF
THE

HAD
NOT
TAKEN
THE
ACTIONS
THEY
DID
THAT
IS
THE
UNDENIABLE
TRUTH
THE
QUESTION
IS
FOR
HOW
LONG
EVEN
IF
THE
FBI
HAD
DONE
NOTHING
I
GUESS
THE
BDS
WOULD
HAVE
COMMITTED
SUICIDE
BUT
MAYBE
NOT
UNTIL
HUNGER
AND
THIRST
GAVE
THEM
THE
CHOICE
BETWEEN
SUCIDE
OR
SURRENDER

BDS
WAS
WARNED
IN

ABOUT
THE
FBI

THEY
HAD
THE
CHANCE

SURRENDER
AND
GET

NO

WHO
STARTED
THE

RESPONSIBLE
FOR

DOUBT
THE
