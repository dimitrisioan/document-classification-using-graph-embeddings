you
might
have
missed
the
us
news
world
report
excerpt
i
posted
it
is
fairly
consistant
with
other
such
polls
finding
that
approximately
of
households
have
at
least
one
firearm
ok
a
nearmajority
actually
own
firearms
but
i
will
still
claim
that
the
vast
majority
never
needs
to
use
them
or
even
threaten
anyone
with
them
to
selfdefense
incidents
a
year
doesnt
count
with
you
what
do
they
do
right
or
are
they
just
lucky
maybe
theyre
just
unlucky
if
a
rapist
pulls
a
woman
into
an
alley
in
boston
chances
are
almost
certain
that
she
wont
be
counted
as
one
of
those
selfdefenders
because
our
local
constabulary
didnt
consider
it
important
that
she
be
allowed
to
arm
herself
even
though
the
shotgun
she
owns
at
home
makes
her
show
up
in
the
gun
owner
column
in
either
case
this
means
the
average
threat
level
in
this
country
is
rather
low
ironic
words
for
somebody
who
lives
in
florida
the
average
threat
level
in
florida
has
been
reduced
by
a
liberal
ccw
policy
its
well
known
that
your
local
thugs
like
to
target
tourists
precisely
because
they
are
less
likely
to
be
carrying
than
your
natives
come
on
up
to
boston
or
nyc
or
washington
dc
and
see
how
much
diddlysquat
the
average
threat
level
in
the
country
means
to
a
resident
there
i
think
you
have
weapons
on
the
brain
i
never
said
that
these
alternative
means
of
selfprotection
involved
any
hardware
why
are
good
neighborhoods
good
it
isnt
because
every
person
is
armed
to
the
teeth
it
is
because
of
attitude
and
cooperation
in
the
good
neighborhoods
the
residents
make
themselves
aware
of
their
neighbors
and
notice
when
strangers
are
lurking
around
good
neighborhoods
form
groups
like
crimewatch
to
increase
this
effect
and
the
relative
effectiveness
of
the
police
when
hostiles
are
arrested
the
good
neighbors
step
up
and
say
thats
the
one
officer
he
was
robbing
mr
jones
house
sometimes
this
works
sometimes
it
just
lands
your
good
neighbors
on
the
dance
card
for
the
next
wave
of
drivebys
someone
here
once
told
a
story
about
la
gangs
moving
into
phoenix
ive
misplaced
the
original
text
but
the
story
started
with
one
resident
calling
the
cops
on
a
gang
member
sure
enough
a
few
nights
later
there
was
a
driveby
performed
at
the
residents
house
except
that
this
time
unlike
in
la
the
entire
street
came
out
and
returned
fire
putting
an
end
to
the
cars
occupants
the
gang
packed
up
and
left
of
course
in
la
or
in
a
place
like
florida
after
the
hurricane
your
first
problem
is
to
find
an
officer
to
step
up
to
and
tell
anything
in
short
the
alternative
to
firepower
is
gangs
or
at
least
a
benificent
manifestation
of
that
social
cooperative
replace
lead
with
flesh
the
flesh
makes
a
better
conversationalist
too
and
you
can
invite
it
over
for
a
block
party
look
nobody
is
arguing
this
i
have
a
fire
extinguisher
at
home
that
doesnt
mean
i
can
be
careless
about
tossing
my
burnt
matches
on
the
carpet
i
live
carefully
monitor
the
woodstove
get
my
flue
cleaned
twice
a
year
and
test
my
smoke
alarms
annually
but
if
despite
all
this
a
fire
does
start
its
too
late
for
any
of
these
things
except
the
extinguisher
but
legality
and
legitimacy
also
matter
if
a
governments
charter
makes
a
rule
which
the
government
then
violates
it
is
violated
the
basis
for
its
existance
enforcement
of
its
will
becomes
a
matter
solely
of
force
of
arms
oliver
north
the
man
is
positively
worshiped
in
many
allamerican
conservative
quarters
he
and
big
ron
setup
a
secret
government
and
did
all
sorts
of
severely
illegal
deeds
the
kind
of
stuff
you
and
i
would
be
doing
twentytolife
for
yet
he
walks
free
this
bs
happens
all
the
time
in
fact
it
happens
so
much
that
no
one
really
cares
anymore
legitimacy
is
a
nonissue
legality
is
a
nonissue
so
long
as
we
get
tbones
and
our
mtv
who
gives
a
rats
ass
you
seem
to
be
agreeing
with
your
opponent
you
cant
trust
your
government
to
protect
you
from
abusers
and
violators
whitecollar
bluecollar
epauletted
or
tankshirted
ultimately
no
one
has
the
power
to
enforce
your
rights
but
you
unless
youve
given
up
that
power
no
i
claimed
that
no
one
is
interested
in
the
statistical
aspects
of
the
argument
pure
emotion
like
the
abortion
issue
too
many
people
fit
that
category
that
is
true
some
of
us
like
to
believe
that
they
are
uninterested
in
the
facts
behind
the
case
for
gun
ownership
because
theyve
been
conditioned
to
believe
that
there
arent
any
you
seem
content
to
underestimate
the
electorate
im
willing
to
try
to
raise
their
consciousness
argue
away
you
cant
win
i
think
we
can
hci
was
founded
in
what
in
the
they
ran
a
one
million
strong
campaign
for
two
years
before
reaching
this
goal
my
understanding
is
that
they
reached
it
by
the
stratagem
of
including
wide
classes
of
people
other
than
duespaying
members
i
cant
speak
authoritatively
on
this
maybe
somebody
else
has
details
then
they
started
running
a
two
million
strong
campaign
for
a
while
but
they
let
it
slip
into
unannounced
obscurity
when
it
became
clear
that
they
simply
were
never
going
to
reach
that
level
of
membership
in
just
after
the
commencement
of
the
dodd
hearings
the
starting
point
of
the
modern
guncontrol
movement
the
nra
had
a
mere
members
by
barely
after
the
first
murmurs
of
future
registration
it
had
about
a
million
today
it
has
over
three
million
members
making
it
the
third
largest
membership
organization
in
the
country
next
to
aarp
and
aaa
and
its
membership
is
growing
faster
than
at
any
previous
time
historical
figures
from
kuklas
gun
control
pp
and
as
you
say
many
of
the
people
in
the
middle
of
this
debate
are
bemused
by
their
tbones
and
mtv
that
leaves
hardcore
gunowners
against
hardcore
gun
banners
i
know
a
number
of
exhci
members
who
have
recently
become
nra
members
ive
never
heard
of
a
single
one
who
has
gone
the
other
way
yes
i
think
we
can
and
will
win
this
one
firearmsrelated
mindless
mayhem
will
be
related
to
the
availibility
of
firearms
if
they
become
scarce
and
and
expensive
a
different
psychology
will
take
hold
i
think
they
would
be
used
far
less
to
settle
trivial
complaints
i
think
they
would
be
used
far
less
to
hammer
nails
as
well
but
like
you
i
cant
give
any
citation
showing
that
this
utilization
is
currently
significant
at
more
than
an
anecdotal
level

you
can
