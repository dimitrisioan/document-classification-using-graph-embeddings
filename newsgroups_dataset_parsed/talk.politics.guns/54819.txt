RE
CONSTITUTIONALITY
OF
USC

BRIAN
SHEETS
WRITES
YOU
KNOW
I
WAS
READING
USC
AND
SOMETHING
JUST
DID
NOT
MAKE
SENCE
AND
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
SOMEONE
COULD
HELP
ME
OUT
SAY
USC
EXCEPT
AS
PROVIDED
IN
PARAGRAPH
IT
SHALL
BE
UNLAWFUL
FOR
ANY
PERSON
TO
TRANSFER
OR
POSSESS
A
MACHINEGUN
WELL
I
GOT
TO
LOOKING
IN
MY
LAW
DICTIONARY
AND
I
FOUND
THAT
A
PERSON
MIGHT
ALSO
BE
AN
ARTIFICIAL
ENTITY
THAT
IS
CREATED
BY
GOVERNMENT
AND
HAS
NO
RIGHTS
UNDER
THE
FEDERAL
CONSTITUTION
SO
WHAT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IS
HOW
A
STATUTE
LIKE
CAN
BE
ENFORCED
ON
AN
INDIVIDUAL
SO
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
HOW
MY
GOVERNMENT
CAN
TELL
ME
WHAT
I
CAN
OR
CANNOT
POSSESS
JUST
PASSING
A
LAW
DOES
NOT
MAKE
IT
LAW
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
LAWS
ARE
CONSTITIONAL
UNTIL
IT
GOES
TO
COURT
SO
HAS
IT
EVER
GONE
TO
COURT
NOT
JUST
YOUR
RUN
OF
THE
MILL
OK
I
HAD
IT
I
AM
GUILTY
PUT
ME
IN
JAIL
HAS
ANYONE
EVER
CLAIMED
THAT
THEY
HAD
A
RIGHT
TO
POSSESS
AND
WAS
TOLD
BY
THE
SUPREME
COURT
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
THAT
RIGHT

BRIANSATLASTELECOM
U
IM
NOT
A
LAWYER
BUT
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THE
CONGRESS
HAS
NO
MORE
RIGHTS
THAN
WHAT
IS
ENUMERATED
IN
THE
CONSTITUTION
THAT
IS
THE
PRIME
REASON
WHY
THE
NATIONAL
FIREARMS
ACT
IS
BASED
ON
COLLECTING
REVENUE
SINCE
THE
CONGRESS
HAS
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
LEVY
TAXES
THE
NFA
IS
A
TAX
ACT
AND
THE
REGISTRATION
REQUIREMENT
WITHIN
IT
IS
TO
ASSIST
IN
THAT
TAX
COLLECTION
USC
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
CONSTITUTIONAL
MUST
HAVE
A
BASIS
ON
A
PARTICULAR
AUTHORITY
GRANTED
TO
THE
CONGRESS
BY
THE
CONSTITUTION
CONGRESS
CAN
NOT
ARBITRARILY
BAN
A
SUBSTANCE
OR
PRODUCT
THAT
IS
WHY
PROHIBITION
CAME
INTO
EFFECT
ONLY
BY
PASSING
AN
AMMENDMENT
WHAT
YOU
SAID
ABOUT
CONSTITUTIONALITY
OF
LAW
NEEDS
TO
BE
CLARIFIED
I
BELIEVE
THAT
AN
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
LAW
WAS
NEVER
CONSTITUTIONAL
WHEN
A
LAW
IS
DETERMINED
BY
THE
SUPREME
COURT
TO
BE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
THAT
LAW
WAS
NEVER
REALLY
A
LAW
THE
VERY
NATURE
OF
THE
LAW
BEING
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
INVALIDATES
THE
LAW
AT
ITS
INCEPTION
PLEASE
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
BUT
WHEN
A
LAW
IS
DEEMED
TO
BE
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
ANYONE
CONVICTED
OF
BREAKING
THAT
LAW
IS
ABSOLVED
I
DONT
BELIEVE
USC
HAS
EVER
BEEN
CHALLENGED
IN
COURT
NFA
HAS
BEEN
INVALIDATED
IN
TWO
FEDERAL
DISTRICT
COURT
CASES
ONE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
APPELLATE
LEVEL
US
VS
ROCK
ISLAND
ARMORY
AND
US
VS
DALTON
