THE
SWISS
POPULATION
IS
AND
WELL
WAS
FAR
LARGER
THAN
THAT
I
THINK
YOUR
QUESTION
SHOULD
BE
LOSING
SLEEP
OVER
A
MILLION
EXPERT
RIFLEMEN
CERTAINLY
HE
COULD
HAVE
CONQUERED
SWITZERLAND
BUT
A
MILLION
ARMED
MILITIAMEN
ESPECIALLY
IN
A
MOUNTAINOUS
AREA
WHERE
TANKS
EFFECTIVENESS
IS
LIMITED
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
A
REAL
PAIN
THE
QUESTION
A
CONQUEROR
WOULD
ASK
IS
IS
IT
WORTH
THE
TROUBLE
THE
MORE
DIFFICULT
AN
INVASION
IS
THE
MORE
LIKELY
THE
ANSWER
WOULD
BE
NO
CERTAINLY
A
MILLION
RIFLEMEN
AS
OPPOSED
TO
A
PROFESSIONAL
ARMY
OF
ONLY
TEN
OR
TWENTY
THOUSAND
THE
BEST
A
COUNTRY
THE
SIZE
OF
SWITZERLAND
COULD
SUPPORT
MAKES
INVASIONS
MORE
DIFFICULT
HITLER
INVADED
YUGOSLAVIA
AND
OCCUPIED
IT
THE
MOUNTAINOUS
PORTIONS
WERE
SOMETIMES
PATROLLED
BY
THE
WERMACHT
BUT
THEY
WERE
CERTAINLY
NOT
IN
CONTROL
THERE
WERE
TWO
MAJOR
NATIVE
FACTIONS
OPPOSING
EACH
OTHER
AND
THE
GERMANS
IT
WAS
BASICALLY
USELESS
TO
THE
GERMANS
NO
PRODUCTION
AND
A
DRAIN
ON
THEIR
RESOURCES
A
ARMORED
DIVISION
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
INFANTRY
DIVISIONS
WHICH
IF
MY
MEMORY
IS
CORRECT
WERE
KIND
OF
STUCK
THERE
UP
UNTIL
THE
ALLIES
ACCEPTED
THEIR
SURRENDER
I
THINK
THAT
THE
ALLIES
ALSO
LET
THE
GERMANS
KEEP
SOME
OF
THEIR
WEAPONS
FOR
SELF
DEFENSE
UNITIL
THEY
WERE
ABLE
TO
GET
TO
THE
LOWLANDS
AWAY
FROM
THE
RESISTANCE
FACTIONS
THIS
IS
FROM
MEMORY
AND
IT
IS
UNRELIABLE
