the
gun
on
the
net
before
getting
facts
straight
i
really
dont
understand
all
this
i
watched
on
satellite
network
feeds
as
perhaps
people
died
before
my
eyes
while
the
two
hueys
fanned
the
flames
and
the
fbi
stopped
the
firetrucks
at
the
gate
something
was
very
wrong
with
that
scene
perhaps
if
id
watched
rambo
movies
i
mightve
been
dulled
to
the
pain
of
fellow
humans
dying
thank
god
i
still
feel
im
very
sorry
for
you
who
dont
for
you
who
think
they
got
what
they
deserved
can
you
really
believe
that
even
if
koresh
was
the
sadistic
mad
man
they
said
he
was
did
the
others
deserve
his
fate
if
in
fact
he
was
mad
wasnt
that
even
more
reason
to
believe
he
duped
his
followers
and
therefore
they
were
innocent
brainwashed
victims
is
there
any
scenaro
that
justifies
all
that
death
and
if
not
it
is
clear
that
the
deaths
would
not
have
occured
if
the
batf
has
not
fucked
up
initially
and
now
the
fbi
got
impaitent
and
pushed
korech
over
the
edge
and
thats
if
you
buy
the
latest
version
of
the
story
hook
line
and
sinker
i
have
believed
all
along
that
they
could
not
let
them
live
the
embarrassment
to
the
batf
and
the
fbi
wouldve
been
too
severe
remember
this
was
a
suspicion
of
taxevasion
warrant
there
were
no
witnesses
except
the
fbi
all
information
filtered
through
the
fbi
all
they
had
to
do
was
allow
one
remote
controlled
pool
camera
be
installed
near
the
building
and
the
press
couldve
done
their
job
and
wouldve
been
able
to
back
the
fbis
story
with
close
up
video
while
incurring
no
risk
to
the
press
unless
they
did
not
want
the
public
to
see
something
the
complete
lack
of
any
other
source
of
information
other
than
the
fbi
really
causes
me
concern
sick
to
my
stomach
and
getting
sicker
from
all
the
government
apologists
jmdhandheldcom
im
always
rethinking
that
theres
never
been
a
day
when
i
havent
rethought
that
but
i
cant
do
that

myself
