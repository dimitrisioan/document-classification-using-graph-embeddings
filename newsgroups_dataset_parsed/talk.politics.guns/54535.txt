THE
IDEA
OF
THE
CARD
IS
BULL
IN
AND
OF
ITS
SELF
BUT
IM
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
DO
THEY
PLAN
ON
MAKING
IT
A
REQUIREMENT
TO
ALWAYS
HAVE
IT
ON
YOU
OR
IS
IT
ONLY
GOING
TO
BE
REQUIRED
TO
BE
PRESENTED
WHEN
TRYING
TO
GE
MEDICAL
AID
THIS
AT
LEAST
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
DETERMINED
THE
BLUE
CROSS
MEDICAL
COVERAGE
FOR
ALL
FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES
IS
A
GOOD
MODEL
FOR
A
FUTURE
NATIONAL
SYSTEM
TO
GET
EMERGENCY
MEDICAL
CARE
ANYONE
SO
INSURED
MUST
ALWAYS
CARRY
THEIR
BLUE
CROSS
CARD
BEFORE
ENTERING
A
HOSPITAL
YOU
MUST
NOTIFY
BLUE
CROSS
OR
THEY
WILL
REFUSE
TO
PAY
YOUR
BILLS
IN
AN
EMERGENCY
WHERE
YOU
MUST
BE
TREATED
BEFORE
NOTIFYING
THEM
YOU
MUST
INFORM
THEM
WITHIN
HOURS
OR
IF
YOU
ARE
UNABLE
TO
DO
SO
FOR
MEDICAL
REASONS
THE
HOSPITAL
MUST
FAILING
TO
DO
SO
WITHIN
HOURS
MEANS
THEY
WILL
NOT
COVER
THE
HOSPITALIZATION
IN
YOU
NEED
YOUR
CARD
TO
NOTIFY
THEM
AND
WITHOUT
THE
CARD
THE
HOSPITAL
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
KNOW
THEY
HAD
TO
THEREFORE
YOU
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
CARRY
THE
CARD
AT
ALL
TIMES
OR
DO
WITHOUT
EMERGENCY
MEDICAL
COVERAGE
WHICH
WORKS
FINE
UNTIL
YOU
END
UP
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
BECAUSE
YOU
WERE
HIT
ON
THE
HEAD
AND
YOUR
WALLET
WITH
YOUR
INSURANCE
CARD
IS
STOLEN
THIS
HAPPENED
TO
ME
AND
IT
TOOK
SIX
MONTHS
TO
SORT
THE
MESS
OUT
THESE
SORTS
OF
PLANS
SOUND
NICE
AT
FIRST
BUT
IN
THE
END
THEY
JUST
CREATE
A
LOT
OF
PAPERWORK
AND
BUREAUCRACY
TO
DEAL
WITH
ALL
THE
CHECKING
AND
FILING
THEY
INVOLVE
TOM
THE
NON
HACKER
WHOA
HAVE
A
CARE
WHAT
YOU
SAY
TOM
THE
OBVIOUS
ANSWER
TO
THAT
PROBLEM
IS
TO
TATOO
YOUR
NATIONAL
ID
NUMBER
ON
YOU
SAY
YOUR
FOREARM
SO
YOU
CAN
NEVER
LEAVE
HOME
WITHOUT
IT
HELL
IT
WORKED
ONCE
BEFORE
AND
THAT
BRINGS
US
BACK
TO
MY
ORIGINAL
SARCASMLADEN
POST
WHERES
THE
OUTCRY
FROM
THE
LIBERAL
SECTOR
OVER
THE
NATIONAL
ID
CARD
MY
GOD
IF
SOME
CONSERVATIVE
HAD
PROPOSED
THIS
PLUS
CLINTONS
NATIONAL
POLICE
PROPOSAL
THE
LIBERALS
WOULD
BE
SHRIEKING
SIEG
HEIL
AND
POLICE
STATE
YOU
SELFSTYLED
LIBERALS
OUGHT
TO
BE
ASHAMED
OF
YOURSELVES
HYPOCRITES
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
WATCH
BUT
I
SAW
A
SPOKESMAN
FOR
THE
ACLU
VOICE
OPPOSITION
TO
THIS
IDEA
ON
NBC
THE
VERY
FIRST
NIGHT
