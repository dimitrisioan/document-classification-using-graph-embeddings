WHAT

STRIDER
PM

I
THINK
MOST
OF
US
WOULD
RATHER
BE
HELD
UP
WITH
A
KNIFE
THAN
WITH
A
GUN
BUT
HOW
THE
HELL
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
MANAGE
THAT
YOU
STILL
HAVENT
OFFERED
IVE
BEEN
WATCHING
THIS
KNIFE
VERSES
GUN
BIT
FOR
A
WHILE
NOW
EVEN
CONTRIBUTED
A
FEW
COMMENTS
BUT
THIS
STUFF
ID
RATHER
FACE
A
KNIFE
THAN
A
GUN
HAS
GOT
TO
COME
FROM
IGNORANCE
I
USED
TO
THINK
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
THING
THEN
I
GOT
EDUCATED
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
AS
A
RULE
UNDERSTAND
HOW
DEADLY
KNIVES
CAN
BE
OR
HOW
QUICKLY
YOU
CAN
BE
KILLED
WITH
ONE
MOST
PEOPLE
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THAT
IT
TAKES
LESS
THAN
AN
INCH
OF
PENETRATION
IN
SOME
AREAS
TO
CAUSE
QUICK
WITHIN
A
MINUTE
OR
SO
DEATH
THE
DEATH
RATES
FROM
HANDGUNS
AND
KNIVES
ARE
WITHIN
A
FEW
PERCENTAGE
POINTS
OF
EACH
OTHER
MANY
PEOPLE
NOT
REALIZING
HOW
DEADLY
KNIVES
ARE
TRY
THEIR
LUCK
AND
THUS
MORE
GET
INJURED
BY
KNIVES
A
GUN
IS
DEADLY
ONLY
IN
A
SINGLE
DIRECTION
AND
ITS
ONLY
ADVANTAGE
IS
THAT
IT
IS
A
REMOTE
CONTROL
WEAPON
A
CONTACT
WEAPON
SUCH
AS
A
KNIFE
CONTROLS
A
SPHERICAL
AREA
TO
FEET
IN
DIAMETER
MOST
PEOPLE
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
KNIFE
WOUNDS
ASIDE
FROM
SLICING
A
FINGER
BY
ACCIDENT
FROM
FEET
OR
SO
A
KNIFE
IS
VERY
NEARLY
AN
EVEN
MATCH
FOR
A
HOLSTERED
GUN
IN
EXPERIENCED
HANDS
EVEN
IF
THE
KNIFE
WIELDER
HAS
ONLY
MODERATE
SKILL
FROM
INSIDE
FEET
OR
SO
A
KNIFE
IS
A
MATCH
FOR
A
DRAWN
GUN
A
KNIFE
IS
UTTERLY
SILENT
IT
NEVER
JAMS
AND
NEVER
RUNS
OUT
OF
AMMUNITION
IT
IS
LIMITED
ONLY
BY
THE
SPEED
DEXTERITY
SKILL
AND
ABILITY
OF
ITS
WIELDER
CRIMINALS
IN
GENERAL
ARE
YOUNG
FAST
AND
STRONG
ITS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
PATTERNED
SLASHING
ATTACKS
USED
BY
MANY
MARTIAL
ARTISTS
REMARKABLY
RESEMBLE
THE
WILD
UNCONTROLLED
SLASHING
ATTACKS
OF
NOVICES
IVE
TALKED
TO
SEVERAL
WELL
TRAINED
MARTIAL
ARTISTS
THEY
HAVE
UNANIMOUSLY
AGREED
THAT
IF
THEY
EVER
GO
UP
AGAINST
A
KNIFE
THEY
SIMPLY
PLAN
ON
BEING
CUT
HOPEFULLY
NOT
AS
BAD
AS
THE
ATTACKER
PRACTICING
WITH
FIREARMS
REQUIRES
FACILITIES
AND
EQUIPMENT
PRACTICING
WITH
KNIVES
REQUIRES
ONLY
A
SMALL
AREA
AND
SOMETHING
TO
SIMULATE
A
KNIFE
SAY
A
POPSICLE
STICK
OR
TOOTH
BRUSH
CRIMINALS
PRACTICE
THEIR
KNIFE
ATTACKS
IN
PRISON
IF
YOU
HAVE
NOT
TRAINED
AGAINST
KNIVES
WITH
A
FIREARM
AND
DO
NOT
REALIZE
THESE
FACTS
THE
FIRST
INKLING
YOU
WILL
HAVE
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
IS
THE
KNIFE
RIPPING
THROUGH
YOUR
THROAT
OR
IN
THE
CASE
OF
AN
EXPERIENCED
ATTACKER
PARTS
OF
YOUR
BODY
FALLING
OFF
ONTO
THE
GROUND
A
YEAR
OLD
MAN
WITH
ARTHRITIS
CAN
CLOSE
THAT
YARD
DISTANCE
AND
GUT
YOU
IN
ABOUT
ONE
AND
A
HALF
SECONDS
DENNIS
TUELLER
WITH
A
BROKEN
LEG
IN
A
WALKING
CAST
MANAGED
IT
IN
TWO
IVE
SEEN
PEOPLE
CLOSE
THAT
DISTANCE
AND
STRIKE
IN
SECOND
IM
OLD
OVER
WEIGHT
AND
SLOW
I
CAN
DO
IT
IN
SECONDS
IVE
SEEN
MORGUE
FOOTAGE
OF
PEOPLE
KILLED
WITH
EDGED
WEAPONS
THAT
YOU
WOULD
NOT
BELIEVE
HOW
ABOUT
A
SINGLE
STAB
WOUND
TO
THE
CHEST
WITH
A
TABLE
FORK
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
ATTACKER
USED
THE
HANDLE
NOT
THE
POINTED
END
ADD
TO
THIS
THE
FACT
THAT
HAND
GUN
STOPPING
POWER
IS
LARGELY
A
MYTH
EXCEPT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
A
CENTRAL
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
SHOT
OR
A
ROUND
THAT
DESTROYS
THE
SKELETAL
STRUCTURE
IT
TAKES
ANYWHERE
FROM
TO
TWELVE
SECONDS
FOR
A
BULLET
WOUND
TO
TAKE
EFFECT
THIS
IS
TRUE
OF
EVEN
HEART
SHOTS
THERE
IS
THE
CASE
OF
THE
POLICE
WOMAN
IN
LA
THE
FIRST
RECORDED
SURVIVOR
OF
A
SHOT
TO
THE
HEART
THAT
LADY
NOT
ONLY
KILLED
HER
ATTACKER
BUT
CHASED
HIM
DOWN
TO
DO
IT
ALL
FOUR
OF
HER
SHOTS
FIRED
AFTER
SHE
HAD
BEEN
SHOT
STRUCK
THE
PERP
ATTA
GIRL
THE
BULLET
ENTERED
HER
ON
A
DOWNWARD
ANGLE
WENT
THROUGH
THE
APEX
OF
HER
HEART
DOWN
THROUGH
THE
DIAPHRAGM
CLIPPED
HER
LIVER
AND
DESTROYED
HER
SPLEEN
IT
THEN
EXITED
HER
BACK
LEAVING
A
TENNIS
BALL
SIZED
HOLE
SHE
DIED
ABOUT
SIX
TIMES
ON
THE
OPERATING
TABLE
BUT
WAS
OUT
OF
THE
HOSPITAL
IN
DAYS
AND
WAS
BACK
ON
FULL
DUTY
IN
EIGHT
MONTHS
SHE
WAS
OFF
DUTY
AT
THE
TIME
AND
NOT
WEARING
HER
VEST
SHE
WAS
ON
HER
WAY
HOME
SO
HAPPENED
TO
HAVE
HER
GUN
NO
SHE
DOESNT
THINK
CIVILIANS
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
SAME
RIGHTS
SIGH
THE
MORAL
OF
THE
STORY
IS
THAT
EVEN
IF
YOU
DO
MANAGE
TO
SHOOT
A
KNIFE
ATTACKER
YOUD
BETTER
BE
PLANNING
ON
DOING
SOME
DODGING
A
GOOD
ALTERNATIVE
IS
TO
SHOOT
FOR
AND
BREAK
THE
PELVIS
PEOPLE
CAN
OFTEN
WALK
A
LITTLE
ON
BROKEN
LEGS
BUT
A
BROKEN
PELVIS
WILL
NEARLY
ALWAYS
ANCHOR
THEM
MANY
FIREARMS
SCHOOLS
RECOMMEND
PELVIS
SHOTS
AGAINST
CONTACT
WEAPONS
THE
TARGET
IS
AS
LARGE
AS
THE
TRADITIONAL
CENTER
OF
MASS
AND
IS
MORE
RELIABLE
TO
STOP
SOMEBODY
WITH
A
CONTACT
WEAPON
ASSUMING
A
CALIBER
POWERFUL
ENOUGH
TO
DO
THE
JOB
HOT
ON
UP
WILL
USUALLY
DO
THIS
REMEMBER
FOLKS
THE
IDEA
ISNT
TO
TAKE
EM
WITH
YOU
BUT
FOR
YOU
TO
LIVE
AND
THEM
TO
FAIL
WHATEVER
THE
CONSEQUENCES
FOR
THEM
THIS
THE
REASON
KILLING
THEM
ISNT
OUR
GOAL
OR
IN
MANY
CASES
EVEN
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
KEEP
US
ALIVE
I
DONT
WANT
TO
FACE
A
VIOLENT
ATTACK
OF
ANY
SORT
KNOWING
WHAT
I
NOW
KNOW
I
CANT
RIGHTLY
SAY
ID
RATHER
FACE
A
KNIFE
THAN
AN
GUN
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
DEPEND
ON
THE
ATTACKER
AND
IF
I
COULD
PICK
AND
CHOOSE
I
WOULDNT
BE
THERE
THIS
IS
REALLY
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
CRIMINALS
DO
NOT
FEAR
THE
LAW
CRIMINALS
DO
NOT
FEAR
THE
WEAPON
THEY
FEAR
THE
CITIZEN
BEHIND
THE
WEAPON
THAT
HAS
SHOWN
THE
RESOLUTION
AND
DETERMINATION
TO
DO
WHATEVER
IT
TAKES
RICK
