FIREARMS
TEND
TO
FALL
INTO
THIS
LOW
DOLLARPOUND
AREA
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
ECONOMIC
TO
SMUGGLE
THEM
IN
ALL
PRODUCTION
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
LOCAL
THERE
ARE
NOT
ALL
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BOTH
THE
SKILL
AND
MOTIVATION
TO
ASSEMBLE
WORTHWHILE
FIREARMS
FROM
SCRATCH
HIGHRANKING
CRIME
FIGURES
COULD
OBTAIN
IMPORTED
UZIS
AND
SUCH
BUT
THE
AVERAGE
PERSON
AND
AVERAGE
THUG
WOULD
BE
LUCKY
TO
GET
A
ZIPGUN
AND
WOULD
PAY
THROUGH
THE
NOSE
FOR
IT
GOOD
POINT
YOU
MAKE
HOWEVER
A
ZIP
GUN
BY
DEFINITION
IS
A
CRUDE
HOMEMADE
GUNCERTAINLY
NOT
SOMETHING
CAPABLE
OF
SUSTAINED
ACCURATE
FIRE
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
USEFUL
AS
A
MEANS
OF
GETTING
A
NORMAL
GUN
RECALL
THE
TINY
SINGLESHOT
PISTOLS
MADE
BY
THE
ALLIES
DURING
WORLD
WAR
II
FOR
USE
BY
PARTISANS
THEY
WERE
ESSENTIALLY
WELLMADE
ZIPGUNS
INCAPABLE
OF
EFFECTIVE
FIRE
BEYOND
A
FEW
FEET
BUT
THEY
WERE
USEFUL
AS
A
MEANS
OF
KILLING
GERMAN
SOLDIERS
FOR
THEIR
GUNS
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
THE
CROWDPLEASIN
FAVORITE
THE
STEN
GUN
WAS
SPECIFICALLY
DESIGNED
TO
REQUIRE
AS

WORK
AS
POSSIBLE
THE
POINTS
BEEN
MADE
HERE
THAT
ONE
COULD
MAKE
A
STEN
CLONE
WITH
STEEL
TUBING
HAND
TOOLS
AND
A
WELDER
I
STILL
THINK
THAT
WHILE
THE
POINT
IS
GOOD
I
THINK
THERES
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
MARIJUANA
AND
FIREARMS
IN
THAT
QUALITY
MARIJUANA
CAN
BE
GROWN
LOCALLY
THERES
NO
NEED
TO
IMPORT
THE
STUFF
IF
GUNS
ARE
BANNED
I
THINK
THE
DEMAND
FOR
REAL
GUNS
WILL
BE
SUFFICIENT
TO
MAKE
SMUGGLING
ECONOMICALLY
FEASIBLE
THUS
RENDERING
A

MOOT
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
RESULT
WOULD
BE
THE
SAMEPEOPLE
WHO
ARENT
CRIMINALS
WONT
HAVE
FIREARMS
AND
BAD
GUYS
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THEM
ONE
WAY

ANOTHER
AND
I
DONT

THAT
AS
