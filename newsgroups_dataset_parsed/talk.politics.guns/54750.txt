you
seem
to
make
two
points
no
one
ultimately
oversees
the
federal
agencies
you
mention
and
since
koresh
apparently
has
a
different
view
point
from
your
baptist
upbringing
then
he
is
not
worthy
of
protection
from
religious
persecution
as
to
being
the
messiah
is
not
christ
within
us
all
must
be
comforting
to
belong
to
a
government
approved
religion
baptists
are
a
cult
two
btw
under
most
of
the
definitions
in
the
dictionary
of
cult
ive
yet
to
meet
a
group
of
baptists
who
were
stockpiling
cambells
soup
and
and
bangingmarrying
thirteen
yuear
olds
i
dont
recall
saying
baptists
do
any
of
that
though
i
suppose
some
do
and
none
of
them
are
listed
in
the
dictionary
as
characteristics
of
a
cult
my
mother
stockpiled
campbells
soup
when
it
was
on

youre
a
sorry
son
of
a

if
you
cant
draw
a
distinction
between
these
two
things
you
are
an
intolerent
foulmouthed
human
you
sound
like
you
are
ready
to
join
the
kkk
or
neonazis
with
a
narrow
mind
like
yours
people
like
you
cheapen
our
constitution
by
using
it
to
defend
sociopaths
who
arent
deserved
of
it
get
a
life
and
chill
on
the
paranoia
far
from
it
i
defend
the
rights
of
anyone
to
be
different
under
our
constitution
which
was
formed
in
part
to
protect
religious
cults
which
had
been
persecuted
in
england
before
migrating
here
to
be

you
are
the
