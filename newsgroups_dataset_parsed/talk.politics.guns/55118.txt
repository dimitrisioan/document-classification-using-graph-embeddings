BURNING

ARTICLE
PVASILION
WRITES
NOT
NECESSARILY
IF
THE
BODY
HAD
BEEN
DENATURED
COOKED
OR
DEHYDRATED
DUE
TO
THE
HEAT
A
PROJECTILE
NEEDS
ONLY
A
MINIMAL
KINETIC
FORCE
TO
PENETRATE
IN
FIRE
AFTERMATHS
BODIES
TEND
TO
FALL
APART
OR
LOOSE
LARGE
CHUNKS
OF
MEAT
WITH
LITTLE
EFFORT
MEDICAL
EXAMINERS
TEND
NOT
TO
LIKE
CLEANING
UP
SUCH
SCENES
AS
SUCH
IF
THE
BODY
HAD
BEEN
SUITABLY
COOKED
A
BULLET
COMMING
FROM
A
MAGAZINE
EXPLOSION
WOULD
MORE
THAN
LIKELY
HAVE
ENOUGH
FORCE
TO
ENTER
AND
THUS
IT
WOULD
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
A
BULLET
ENTERED
AT
THE
TIME
OF
DEATH
OR
MUCH
LATER
UNLESS
YOU
WERE
TRAINED
TO
LOOK
FOR
THE

PVASILION
THIS
IS
QUITE
CORECT
BUT
A
BULLET
HITTING
A
BURNED
BODY
WITH
LITTLE
ENERGY
WILL
SHOW
VIRTUALLY
NO
DEFORMATION
IE
A
HOLLOW
POINT
PROBABLY
WOULD
NOT
EXPAND
AN
FMJ
WOULD
BE
PRISTENE
ALSO
THE
BULLETS
WILL
NOT
BE
MARKED
WITH
THE
LANDS
ANG
GROOVES
OF
A
BARREL
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDNT
COME
OUT
OF
ONE
A
GOOD
PATHOLOGIST
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
NOTICE
THIS
RIGHT
AWAY
LET
US
HOPE
THAT
THE
MES
THAT
HANDLE
THESE
BODIES
ARE
MORE
COMPETENT
THEN
THE
ONES
WHO
DID
