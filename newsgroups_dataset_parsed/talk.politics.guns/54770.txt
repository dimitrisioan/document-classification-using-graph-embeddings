and
another
survivor
claims
he
heard
someone
shouting
the
fires
started
odd
terminology
thats
what
one
says
when
you
know
a
fire
is
planned
not
when
one
occurs
by
accident
its
also
what
you
say
when
youre
waiting
for
the
end
to
come
in
a
fiery
apocalypsejust
a
thought
personally
if
the
fire
was
set
by
either
side
i
wonder
about
the
timing
if
koresh
co
set
the
fires
why
wait
through
six
hours
of
wallbashing
and
teargassing
before
starting
was
there
anything
new
that
happened
just
around
that
point
similarly
if
the
fbi
were
going
to
torch
the
place
and
fake
it
of
course
why
wait
so
long
wouldnt
it
be
more
reasonable
to
believe
the
bds
would
set
the
fire
early
after
the
assault
began
the
most
plausible
to
me
explaination
is
that
of
an
accidental
starting
of
the
fire
by
the
tanks
among
other
things
i
say
that
because
i
was
listening
to
the
radio
when
the
fire
started
and
the
reporter
watching
from
a
distance
of
course
said
that
it
looked
like
at
least
one
of
the
tanks
had
penetrated
farther
into
the
building
than
previously
specifically
he
said
that
one
tank
apparently
was
halfway
half
of
the
tanks
lenght
into
the
building
where
it
previously
had
only
been
penetrating
a
few
feet
reserving
judgement
