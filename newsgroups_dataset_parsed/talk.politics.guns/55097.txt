freed

has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
building

ill
come
out
as
soon
as
i
finish
my
manuscript

oh
ok
david
i
agree
that
koresh
was
as
much
of
a
victim
as
a
perpetrator
this
because
he
grew
up
inside
the
cult
and
engaged
in
a
power
struggle
where
his
supporters
helped
inflate
his
ego
that
doesnt
change
the
fact
that
he
was
a
loose
fucking
cannon
with
a
shitload
of
serious
weapons
or
that
he
was
banging
thirteen
year
olds
and
twisting
their
impressionable
little
minds
this
was
no
move
fuckup
a
helicoptor
was
thermalimaging
the
compound
that
afternoon
and
detected
three
fires
erupting
almost
simultaneously
there
were
no
cs
canisters
a
specially
modified
abrams
was
pupming
the
stuff
in
no
chance
of
starting
a
fire
there
kerosene
lamps
maybe
one
but
not
three
fires
no
way
koresh
wasnt
just
talking
out
of
his
ass
i
expected
this
to
happen
maybe
they
wanted
it
to
look
like
murder
he
had
days
i
think
this
was
coming
the
whole
time
he
didnt
even
put
the
children
in
the
buried
bus
or
the
underground
bunker
during
the
cs
seige
he
put
them
up
into
the
tower
to
die
fuck
all
of
you
big
brother
paranoid
freaks
the
only
good
thing
to
come
of
any
of
this
is
that
there
will
be
one
less
group
of
crazoids
to
attract
some
of
the
more
rootless
members
of
our
society

i
have
not
made
up
my
mind
about
waco
but
there
sure
seems
to
be
a
group
of
devoted
government
following
fanatics
willing
to
believe
whatever
that
government
wants
to
tell
them
without
any
shred
of
doubt
nor
thought
of
thier
own
they
sure
get
shrill
whenever
their
belief
structure
is
being
shaken
kinda

you
