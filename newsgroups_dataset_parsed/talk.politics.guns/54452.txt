THERE
ARE
MURDERS
EACH

AND
UNDER
DIE
IN
THE
MANNER
YOU
SUGGEST
IF
ONLY
OF
THE
MURDERS
WERE
KILLINGS
BY
WACKOS
YOU
WOULD
BE
WRONG
WORSE
THERE
ARE
ALSO
RAPES
AND
AGGRAVATED
ASSAULTS
EACH
YEAR
THESE
NUMBERS
MAKE
VIOLENT
ATTACKS
AND
PREVENTING
THEM
THOUSANDS
OF
TIMES
MORE
SIGNIFICANT
THAN
THE
ACCIDENTS
YOU
