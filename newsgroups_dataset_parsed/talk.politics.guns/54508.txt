WASHINGTON
APRIL
FOLLOWING
ARE
REMARKS
BY
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
IN
A
QUESTION
AND
ANSWER
SESSION
WITH
THE
PRESS
PM
EDT
THE
PRESIDENT
ON
FEBRUARY
THE
FOUR
FEDERAL
AGENTS
WERE
KILLED
IN
THE
LINE
OF
DUTY
TRYING
TO
ENFORCE
THE
LAW
AGAINST
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIAN
COMPOUND
WHICH
HAD
ILLEGALLY
STOCKPILED
WEAPONRY
AND
AMMUNITION
AND
PLACED
INNOCENT
CHILDREN
AT
RISK
BECAUSE
THE
BATF
OPERATION
HAD
FAILED
TO
MEET
ITS
OBJECTIVE
A
STANDOFF
ENSUED
THE
FEDERAL
BUREAU
OF
INVESTIGATION
THEN
MADE
EVERY
REASONABLE
EFFORT
TO
BRING
THIS
PERILOUS
SITUATION
TO
AN
END
WITHOUT
BLOODSHED
AND
FURTHER
LOSS
OF
LIFE
THE
BUREAUS
EFFORTS
WERE
ULTIMATELY
UNAVAILING
BECAUSE
THE
INDIVIDUAL
WITH
WHOM
THEY
WERE
DEALING
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
DANGEROUS
IRRATIONAL
AND
PROBABLY
INSANE
HE
ENGAGED
IN
NUMEROUS
ACTIVITIES
WHICH
VIOLATED
BOTH
FEDERAL
LAW
AND
COMMON
STANDARDS
OF
DECENCY
HE
WAS
MOREOVER
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
DEATHS
AND
INJURIES
WHICH
OCCURRED
DURING
THE
ACTION
AGAINST
THE
COMPOUND
IN
FEBRUARY
GIVEN
HIS
INCLINATION
TOWARDS
VIOLENCE
AND
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
PROTECT
HIS
YOUNG
HOSTAGES
NO
PROVOCATIVE
ACTIONS
WERE
TAKEN
FOR
MORE
THAN
SEVEN
WEEKS
BY
FEDERAL
AGENTS
AGAINST
THE
COMPOUND
THIS
WEEKEND
I
WAS
BRIEFED
BY
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
RENO
ON
AN
OPERATION
PREPARED
BY
THE
FBI
DESIGNED
TO
INCREASE
PRESSURE
ON
KORESH
AND
PERSUADE
THOSE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
TO
SURRENDER
PEACEFULLY
THE
PLAN
INCLUDED
A
DECISION
TO
WITHHOLD
THE
USE
OF
AMMUNITION
EVEN
IN
THE
FACE
OF
FIRE
AND
INSTEAD
TO
USE
TEAR
GAS
THAT
WOULD
NOT
CAUSE
PERMANENT
HARM
TO
HEALTH
BUT
WOULD
IT
WAS
HOPED
FORCE
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
TO
COME
OUTSIDE
AND
TO
SURRENDER
I
WAS
INFORMED
OF
THE
PLAN
TO
END
THE
SIEGE
I
DISCUSSED
IT
WITH
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
RENO
I
ASKED
THE
QUESTIONS
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
APPROPRIATE
FOR
ME
TO
ASK
I
THEN
TOLD
HER
TO
DO
WHAT
SHE
THOUGHT
WAS
RIGHT
AND
I
TAKE
FULL
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THE
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
THE
DECISION
YESTERDAYS
ACTION
ENDED
IN
A
HORRIBLE
HUMAN
TRAGEDY
MR
KORESHS
RESPONSE
TO
THE
DEMANDS
FOR
HIS
SURRENDER
BY
FEDERAL
AGENTS
WAS
TO
DESTROY
HIMSELF
AND
MURDER
THE
CHILDREN
WHO
WERE
HIS
CAPTIVES
AS
WELL
AS
ALL
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
THERE
WHO
DID
NOT
SURVIVE
HE
KILLED
THOSE
HE
CONTROLLED
AND
HE
BEARS
ULTIMATE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THE
CARNAGE
THAT
ENSUED
NOW
WE
MUST
REVIEW
THE
PAST
WITH
AN
EYE
TOWARDS
THE
FUTURE
I
HAVE
DIRECTED
THE
UNITED
STATED
DEPARTMENTS
OF
JUSTICE
AND
TREASURY
TO
UNDERTAKE
A
VIGOROUS
AND
THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION
TO
UNCOVER
WHAT
HAPPENED
AND
WHY
AND
WHETHER
ANYTHING
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
DNE
DIFFERENTLY
I
HAVE
TOLD
THE
DEPARTMENTS
TO
INVOLVE
INDEPENDENT
PROFESSIONAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
OFFICIALS
IN
THE
INVESTIGATION
I
EXPECT
TO
RECEIVE
ANALYSIS
AND
ANSWERS
IN
WHATEVER
TIME
IS
REQUIRED
TO
COMPLETE
THE
REVIEW
FINALLY
I
HAVE
DIRECTED
THE
DEPARTMENTS
TO
COOPERATE
FULLY
WITH
ALL
CONGRESSIONAL
INQUIRIES
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
CONTINUE
TO
BE
FULLY
ACCOUNTABLE
TO
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
I
WANT
TO
EXPRESS
MY
APPRECIATION
TO
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
TO
THE
JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT
AND
TO
THE
FEDERAL
AGENTS
ON
THE
FRONT
LINES
WHO
DID
THE
BEST
JOB
THEY
COULD
UNDER
DEEPLY
DIFFICULT
CIRCUMSTANCES
AGAIN
I
WANT
TO
SAY
AS
I
DID
YESTERDAY
I
AM
VERY
SORRY
FOR
THE
LOSS
OF
LIFE
WHICH
OCCURRED
AT
THE
BEGINNING
AND
AT
THE
END
OF
THIS
TRAGEDY
IN
WACO
I
HOPE
VERY
MUCH
THAT
OTHERS
WHO
WILL
BE
TEMPTED
TO
JOIN
CULTS
AND
TO
BECOME
INVOLVED
WITH
PEOPLE
LIKE
DAVID
KORESH
WILL
BE
DETERRED
BY
THE
HORRIBLE
SCENES
THEY
HAVE
SEEN
OVER
THE
LAST
SEVEN
WEEKS
AND
I
HOPE
VERY
MUCH
THAT
THE
DIFFICULT
SITUATIONS
WHICH
FEDERAL
AGENTS
CONFRONTED
THERE
AND
WHICH
THEY
WILL
BE
DOUBTLESS
REQUIRED
TO
CONFRONT
IN
OTHER
CONTEXTS
IN
THE
FUTURE
WILL
BE
SOMEWHAT
BETTER
HANDLED
AND
BETTER
UNDERSTOOD
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
LEARNED
NOW
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
CAN
YOU
FIRST
OF
ALL
TELL
US
WHY
AFTER
DAYS
YOU
DECIDED
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
CAN
YOU
DESCRIBE
FOR
US
WHAT
IT
IS
THAT
JANET
RENO
OUTLINED
TO
YOU
IN
YOUR
PHONE
CONVERSATION
WITH
THE
PRESIDENT
I
CANT
HEAR
YOU
BOTH
IF
ONE
WILL
GO
FIRST
AND
THEN
THE
OTHER
Q
SORRY
CAN
YOU
DESCRIBE
WHAT
JANET
RENO
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
THE
PRESIDENT
ILL
ANSWER
BOTH
YOUR
QUESTIONS
BUT
I
CANT
DO
IT
AT
ONCE
Q
CAN
YOU
DESCRIBE
WHAT
SHE
TOLD
YOU
ON
SUNDAY
ABOUT
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
OPERATION
AND
HOW
MUCH
DETAIL
YOU
KNEW
ABOUT
IT
THE
PRESIDENT
YES
I
WAS
TOLD
BY
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
THAT
THE
FBI
STRONGLY
FELT
THAT
THE
TIME
HAD
COME
TO
TAKE
ANOTHER
STEP
IN
TRYING
TO
DISLODGE
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMPOUND
AND
SHE
DESCRIBED
GENERALLY
WHAT
THE
OPERATION
WOULD
BE
THAT
THEY
WANTED
TO
GO
IN
AND
USE
TEAR
GAS
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
TESTED
NOT
TO
CAUSE
PERMANENT
DAMAGE
TO
ADULTS
OR
TO
CHILDREN
BUT
WHICH
WOULD
MAKE
IT
VERY
DIFFICULT
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
STAY
INSIDE
THE
BUILDING
AND
IT
WAS
HOPED
THAT
THE
TEAR
GAS
WOULD
PERMIT
THEM
TO
COME
OUTSIDE
I
WAS
FURTHER
TOLD
THAT
UNDER
NO
CIRCUMSTANCES
WOULD
OUR
PEOPLE
FIRE
ANY
SHOTS
AT
THEM
EVEN
IF
FIRED
UPON
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
SHOOT
THE
TEAR
GAS
FROM
ARMORED
VEHICLES
WHICH
WOULD
PROTECT
THEM
AND
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
EXCHANGE
OF
FIRE
IN
FACT
AS
YOU
KNOW
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
SHOTS
WERE
FIRED
BY
THE
CULT
MEMBERS
AT
THE
FEDERAL
OFFICIALS
THERE
WERE
NO
SHOTS
COMING
BACK
FROM
THE
GOVERNMENT
SIDE
I
ASKED
A
NUMBER
OF
QUESTIONS
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
I
ASKED
IS
WHY
NOW
WE
HAVE
WAITED
SEVEN
WEEKS
WHY
NOW
THE
REASONS
I
WAS
GIVEN
WERE
THE
FOLLOWING
NUMBER
ONE
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
LIMIT
TO
HOW
LONG
THE
FEDERAL
AUTHORITIES
COULD
MAINTAIN
WITH
THEIR
LIMITED
RESOURCES
THE
QUALITY
AND
INTENSITY
OF
COVERAGE
BY
EXPERTS
THERE
THEY
MIGHT
BE
NEEDED
IN
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
NUMBER
TWO
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
REVIEWED
THIS
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
A
CASE
QUITE
LIKE
THIS
ONE
BEFORE
AND
THEY
WERE
CONVINCED
THAT
NO
PROGRESS
HAD
BEEN
MADE
RECENTLY
AND
NO
PROGRESS
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
MADE
THROUGH
THE
NORMAL
MEANS
OF
GETTING
KORESH
AND
THE
OTHER
CULT
MEMBERS
TO
COME
OUT
NUMBER
THREE
THAT
THE
DANGER
OF
THEIR
DOING
SOMETHING
TO
THEMSELVES
OR
TO
OTHERS
WAS
LIKELY
TO
INCREASE
NOT
DECREASE
WITH
THE
PASSAGE
OF
TIME
AND
NUMBER
FOUR
THAT
THEY
HAD
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
WHO
WERE
STILL
INSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
WERE
BEING
ABUSED
SIGNIFICANTLY
AS
WELL
AS
BEING
FORCED
TO
LIVE
IN
UNSANITARY
AND
UNSAFE
CONDITIONS
SO
FOR
THOSE
REASONS
THEY
WANTED
TO
MOVE
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
SECOND
QUESTION
I
ASKED
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
IS
WHETHER
THEY
HAD
GIVEN
CONSIDERATION
TO
ALL
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
COULD
GO
WRONG
AND
EVALUATED
THEM
AGAINST
WHAT
MIGHT
HAPPEN
THAT
WAS
GOOD
SHE
SAID
THAT
THE
FBI
PERSONNEL
ON
THE
SCENE
AND
THOSE
WORKING
WITH
THEM
WERE
CONVINCED
THAT
THE
CHANCES
OF
BAD
THINGS
HAPPENING
WOULD
ONLY
INCREASE
WITH
THE
PASSAGE
OF
TIME
THE
THIRD
QUESTION
I
ASKED
WAS
HAS
THE
MILITARY
BEEN
CONSULTED
AS
SOON
AS
THE
INITIAL
TRAGEDY
CAME
TO
LIGHT
IN
WACO
THATS
THE
FIRST
THING
I
ASKED
TO
BE
DONE
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
OBVIOUS
THAT
THIS
WAS
NOT
A
TYPICAL
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
SITUATION
MILITARY
PEOPLE
WERE
THEN
BROUGHT
IN
HELPED
TO
ANALYZE
THE
SITUATION
AND
SOME
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
THAT
WERE
PRESENTED
BY
IT
AND
SO
I
ASKED
IF
THE
MILITARY
HAD
BEEN
CONSULTED
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
SAID
THAT
THEY
HAD
AND
THAT
THEY
WERE
IN
BASIC
AGREEMENT
THAT
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
MINOR
TACTICAL
DIFFERENCE
OF
OPINION
BETWEEN
THE
FBI
AND
THE
MILITARY
SOMETHING
THAT
BOTH
SIDES
THOUGHT
WAS
NOT
OF
OVERWHELMING
SIGNIFICANCE
HAVING
ASKED
THOSE
QUESTIONS
AND
GOTTEN
THOSE
ANSWERS
I
SAID
THAT
IF
SHE
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
THE
RIGHT
THING
TO
DO
THAT
SHE
SHOULD
PROCEED
AND
THAT
I
WOULD
SUPPORT
IT
AND
I
STAND
BY
THAT
TODAY
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
THE
PRESIDENT
WAIT
GO
AHEAD
Q
CAN
YOU
ADDRESS
THE
WIDESPREAD
PERCEPTION
REPORTED
WIDELY
TELEVISION
RADIO
AND
NEWSPAPERS
THAT
YOU
WERE
TRYING
SOMEHOW
TO
DISTANCE
YOURSELF
FROM
THIS
DISASTER
THE
PRESIDENT
NO
IM
BEWILDERED
BY
IT
THE
ONLY
REASON
I
MADE
NO
PUBLIC
STATEMENT
YESTERDAY
LET
ME
SAY
THE
ONLY
REASON
I
MADE
NO
PUBLIC
STATEMENT
YESTERDAY
IS
THAT
I
HAD
NOTHING
TO
ADD
TO
WHAT
WAS
BEING
SAID
AND
I
LITERALLY
DID
NOT
KNOW
UNTIL
RATHER
LATE
IN
THE
DAY
WHETHER
ANYBODY
WAS
STILL
ALIVE
OTHER
THAN
THOSE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
ACTUALLY
SEEN
AND
TAKEN
TO
THE
HOSPITAL
OR
TAKEN
INTO
CUSTODY
IT
WAS
PURELY
AND
SIMPLY
A
QUESTION
OF
WAITING
FOR
EVENTS
TO
UNFOLD
THERE
WAS
I
HAVE
I
CANT
ACCOUNT
FOR
WHY
PEOPLE
SPECULATED
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
BUT
I
TALKED
TO
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
ON
THE
DAY
BEFORE
THE
ACTION
TOOK
PLACE
I
TALKED
TO
HER
YESTERDAY
I
CALLED
HER
AGAIN
LATE
LAST
NIGHT
AFTER
SHE
APPEARED
ON
THE
LARRY
KING
SHOW
AND
I
TALKED
TO
HER
AGAIN
THIS
MORNING
A
PRESIDENT
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
PRESIDENT
TO
DISTANCE
HIMSELF
FROM
THINGS
THAT
HAPPEN
WHEN
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
IS
IN
CONTROL
I
WILL
SAY
THIS
HOWEVER
I
WAS
FRANKLY
SURPRISED
WOULD
BE
A
MILD
WORD
TO
SAY
THAT
ANYONE
THAT
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
SHOULD
RESIGN
BECAUSE
SOME
RELIGIOUS
FANATICS
MURDERED
THEMSELVES
APPLAUSE
I
REGRET
WHAT
HAPPENED
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
IN
THIS
LIFE
TO
CONTROL
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
OTHERS
IN
EVERY
CIRCUMSTANCE
THESE
PEOPLE
KILLED
FOUR
FEDERAL
OFFICIALS
IN
THE
LINE
OF
DUTY
THEY
WERE
HEAVILY
ARMED
THEY
FIRED
ON
FEDERAL
OFFICIALS
YESTERDAY
REPEATEDLY
AND
THEY
WERE
NEVER
FIRED
BACK
ON
WE
DID
EVERYTHING
WE
COULD
TO
AVOID
THE
LOSS
OF
LIFE
THEY
MADE
THE
DECISION
TO
IMMOLATE
THEMSELVES
AND
I
REGRET
IT
TERRIBLY
AND
I
FEEL
AWFUL
ABOUT
THE
CHILDREN
BUT
IN
THE
END
THE
LAST
COMMENT
I
HAD
FROM
JANET
RENO
IS
WHEN
AND
I
TALKED
TO
HER
ON
SUNDAY
I
SAID
NOW
I
WANT
YOU
TO
TELL
ME
ONCE
MORE
WHY
YOU
BELIEVE
NOT
WHY
THEY
BELIEVE
WHY
YOU
BELIEVE
WE
SHOULD
MOVE
NOW
RATHER
THAN
WAIT
SOME
MORE
AND
SHE
SAID
ITS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
THEY
HAVE
EVIDENCE
THAT
THOSE
CHILDREN
ARE
STILL
BEING
ABUSED
AND
THAT
THEYRE
IN
INCREASINGLY
UNSAFE
CONDITIONS
AND
THAT
THEY
DONT
THINK
IT
WILL
GET
ANY
EASIER
WITH
TIME
WITH
THE
PASSAGE
OF
TIME
I
HAVE
TO
TAKE
THEIR
WORD
FOR
THAT
SO
THAT
IS
WHERE
I
THINK
THINGS
STAND
Q
CAN
WE
ASSUME
THEN
THAT
YOU
DONT
THINK
THIS
WAS
MISHANDLED
IN
VIEW
OF
THE
OUTCOME
THAT
YOU
DIDNT
RUN
OUT
OF
PATIENCE
AND
IF
YOU
HAD
IT
TO
DO
OVER
AGAIN
WOULD
YOU
REALLY
DECIDE
THAT
WAY
THE
PRESIDENT
NO
WELL
I
THINK
WHAT
YOU
CAN
ASSUME
IS
JUST
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
ANNOUNCED
TODAY
THIS
IS
A
THE
FBI
HAS
DONE
A
LOT
OF
THINGS
RIGHT
FOR
THIS
COUNTRY
OVER
A
LONG
PERIOD
OF
TIME
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
FBI
THAT
FOUND
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
BOMBED
THE
WORLD
TRADE
CENTER
IN
LICKETYSPLIT
RECORD
TIME
WE
WANT
AN
INQUIRY
TO
ANALYZE
THE
STEPS
ALONG
THE
WAY
IS
THERE
SOMETHING
ELSE
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
IS
THERE
SOME
OTHER
QUESTION
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
ASKED
IS
THERE
SOME
OTHER
QUESTION
I
SHOULD
HAVE
ASKED
CAN
I
SAY
FOR
SURE
THAT
NO
ONE
THAT
WE
COULD
HAVE
DONE
NOTHING
ELSE
TO
MAKE
THE
OUTCOME
COME
DIFFERENT
I
DONT
KNOW
THAT
THATS
WHY
I
WANT
THE
INQUIRY
AND
THATS
WHY
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
WE
HAVE
SOME
INDEPENDENT
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
PEOPLE
NOT
POLITICAL
PEOPLE
BUT
TOTALLY
NONPOLITICAL
OUTSIDE
EXPERTS
WHO
CAN
BRING
TO
BEAR
THE
BEST
EVIDENCE
WE
HAVE
THERE
IS
UNFORTUNATELY
A
RISE
IN
THIS
SORT
OF
FANATICISM
ALL
ACROSS
THE
WORLD
AND
WE
MAY
HAVE
TO
CONFRONT
IT
AGAIN
AND
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHETHER
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
WE
CAN
DO
PARTICULARLY
WHEN
THERE
ARE
CHILDREN
INVOLVED
BUT
I
DO
THINK
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
RECOGNIZE
THAT
THE
WRONGDOERS
IN
THIS
CASE
WERE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
KILLED
OTHERS
AND
THEN
KILLED
THEMSELVES
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
WERE
THERE
ANY
OTHER
OPTIONS
PRESENTED
TO
YOU
FOR
RESOLVING
THIS
SITUATION
AT
ANY
POINT
FROM
FEBRUARY
UNTIL
YESTERDAY
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
YES
I
GOT
REGULAR
REPORTS
ALL
ALONG
THE
WAY
THERE
WERE
LOTS
OF
OTHER
OPTIONS
PURSUED
IF
YOU
GO
BACK
YOU
ALL
COVERED
IT
VERY
WELL
THE
FBI
YOU
DID
A
VERY
GOOD
JOB
OF
IT
I
MEAN
THE
FBI
AND
THE
OTHER
AUTHORITIES
THERE
PURSUED
ANY
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
OPTIONS
ALL
ALONG
THE
WAY
AND
A
LOT
OF
THEM
EARLY
ON
SEEMED
TO
BE
WORKING
SOME
OF
THE
CHILDREN
GOT
OUT
SOME
OF
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
LEFT
THERE
WAS
A
AT
ONE
POINT
THERE
SEEMED
TO
BE
SOME
LINES
OF
COMMUNICATION
OPENING
UP
BETWEEN
KORESH
AND
THE
AUTHORITIES
AND
THEN
HE
WOULD
SAY
THINGS
AND
NOT
DO
THEM
AND
THINGS
JUST
BEGAN
TO
SPIN
DOWNWARD
WHETHER
THERE
WERE
OTHER
IN
TERMS
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
YESTERDAY
THE
CONVERSATION
I
HAD
WITH
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
DID
NOT
INVOLVE
OTHER
OPTIONS
EXCEPT
WHETHER
WE
SHOULD
TAKE
MORE
TIME
WITH
THE
PRESENT
STRATEGY
WE
WERE
PURSUING
BECAUSE
THEY
SAID
THEY
WANTED
TO
DO
THIS
BECAUSE
THEY
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
GET
PEOPLE
OUT
OF
THE
COMPOUND
QUICKLY
BEFORE
THEY
COULD
KILL
THEMSELVES
THATS
WHAT
THEY
THOUGHT
Q
DID
THE
GOVERNMENT
KNOW
THAT
THE
CHILDREN
DID
NOT
HAVE
GAS
MASKS
Q
CONGRESSIONAL
HEARINGS
ONCE
THE
SITUATION
ARE
YOU
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
THATS
UP
TO
THE
CONGRESS
THEY
CAN
DO
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
BUT
I
THINK
ITS
VERY
IMPORTANT
THAT
THE
TREASURY
AND
JUSTICE
DEPARTMENTS
LAUNCH
THIS
INVESTIGATION
AND
BRING
IN
SOME
OUTSIDE
EXPERTS
AND
AS
I
SAID
IN
MY
STATEMENT
IF
ANY
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMITTEES
WANT
TO
LOOK
INTO
IT
WE
WILL
FULLY
COOPERATE
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
HIDE
HERE
THIS
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
MOST
WELLCOVERED
OPERATION
OF
ITS
KIND
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
COUNTRY
