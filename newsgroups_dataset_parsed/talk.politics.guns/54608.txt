hey
gang
its
not
about
duck
hunting
or
about
dark
alleys
its
about
blackclad
helmeted
and
booted
troops
storming
houses
and
violating
civil
rights
under
color
of
law
are
you
ready
to
defend
your
constitution
its
also
about
crazy
fatigue
clad
survivalist
types
blasting
the
snot
out
of
people
who
accidentally
stray
onto
his
land
in
the
name
of
self
defense
dont
get
too
selfrighteous
mr
guntoter
aint
got
a
pair
of
fatigues
and
i
dont
blast
people
wandering
aimlessly
i
ask
them
what
theyre
doing
there
i
only
blast
people
who
display
obvious
violent
intent
like
blackclad
men
with
weapons
climbing
thru
secondstory
windows
or
people
who
break
down
the
door
instead
of
knocking
or
people
who
knock
my
house
down
with
tanks
and
set
it
afire
sound
familiar
yet
riddle
me
this
why
the
hell
are
the
convicted
criminals
in
ohio
getting
the
kid
glove
treatment
and
the
bds
are
burned
alive
without
a
trial
put
aside
who
started
the
blaze
i
still
think
any
decent
shyster
can
make
a
case
for
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
playing
the
sounds
of
tortured
rabbits
over
the
loudspeakers
wheres
the
spca
in
all
this
oh
and
thats
mister
guntoter
sir
to
you
bucko
just
because
you
choose
to
abandon
your
rights
leave
mine
the
hell
alone
