ABC
CONFIRMS
TWO
POINTS
OF
FBIS
VERSION
WELL
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHY
FIRE
EQUIPMENT
TOOK
SO
LONG
TO
REACH
THE
COMPOUND
HAS
BEEN
ANSWERED
ABC
AIRED
A
REPORT
INCLUDING
THE
TAPES
FROM
MONDAY
THE
FBI
CALLED
WITHIN
MINUTES
OF
THE
FIRES
BREAKOUT
UNFORTUNATELY
DISPATCH
OF
VEHICLES
OUTSIDE
THE
WACO
CITY
LIMITS
REQUIRED
APPROVAL
OF
A
DEPUTY
CHIEF
WHO
WAS
NOT
AVAILABLE
LITERALLY
OUT
TO
LUNCH
THE
OPERATOR
DESPERATELY
CALLED
AROUND
TO
LOCAL
COMMUNITY
VOLUNTEER
FIRE
DEPARTMENTS
TO
GET
SOMETHING
OUT
THERE
BY
THE
TIME
TRUCKS
ARRIVED
MINUTES
LATER
THE
WHOLE
COMPLEX
WAS
AFLAME
AND
IT
WAS
CLEARLY
TOO
LITTLE
TOO
LATE
THERE
WERE
JUST
TWO
PUMPERS
AND
NO
WATER
SUPPLY
THE
FBI
MADE
ANOTHER
CALL
REQUESTING
A
TANK
TRUCK
BUT
THE
WACO
DEPARTMENT
APPARENTLY
DEPENDED
ON
HYDRANTS
AND
DID
NOT
HAVE
ONE
THOUGH
CLEARLY
UNWILLING
TO
RISK
FIREMENS
LIVES
IN
THE
LINE
OF
FIRE
IT
SEEMS
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
DONE
SO
HAD
THERE
BEEN
SUFFICIENT
EQUIPMENT
AND
WATER
TO
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
THEY
EVEN
AIRED
A
TAPE
OF
A
WOMAN
WHO
CALLED
WACO
FROM
GEORGIA
ASKING
IF
ANYTHING
WAS
BEING
DONE
CIVICMINDED
BUT
PROBABLY
IRRESPONSIBLE
IF
EVERYONE
WATCHING
TELEVISION
DID
THAT
NO
LOCAL
CALLS
COULD
GET
THROUGH
ABC
ALSO
AIRED
THE
COMMENTS
OF
AN
INDEPENDENT
FIRE
INVESTIGATOR
WHO
VIEWED
TAPES
FROM
MORE
THAN
ONE
SIDE
OF
THE
COMPOUND
NOT
JUST
THE
STANDARD
POOL
SHOT
AND
AGREED
THAT
THE
FIRE
A
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
STARTED
IN
AT
LEAST
PLACES
AND
B
MUST
HAVE
HAD
AN
ACCELERANT
TO
SPREAD
SO
FAST
NEITHER
OF
THESE
IS
CONCLUSIVE
PROOF
THAT
THE
KORESH
CROWD
OFFED
THEMSELVES
MORE
THAN
THE
FBI
OFFED
THEM
BUT
ITS
A
HECK
OF
A
LOT
STRONGER
PROOF
THAN
SOME
OF
THE
THEORIES
FLOATING
AROUND
THE
NET
SCORE

IS
THAT
