ROBY
WRITES
I
AGREE
THAT
THEY
DESERVED
A
TRIAL
THEY
HAD
MORE
THAN
DAYS
TO
COME
OUT
AND
GET
THEIR
TRIAL
THEY
CHOSE
TO
KEEP
THE
CHILDREN
WITH
THEM
AND
TO
STAY
INSIDE
THEY
CHOSE
TO
STAY
INSIDE
EVEN
AFTER
THEY
WERE
TEAR
GASSED
I
DO
NOT
FIND
THESE
ACTIONS
RATIONAL
EVEN
NORIEGA
WAS
SMART
ENOUGH
TO
GIVE
UP
AND
GO
FOR
THE
TRIAL
HE
DESERVED
MR
ROBY
YOU
ARE
A
GOVERNMENT
SUCKING
HEARTLESS
BASTARD
UNWORTHY
OF
COMMENT
HUMANS
DIED
YESTERDAY
HUMANS
WHO
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
DIED
IF
THE
FBI
HAD
NOT
TAKEN
THE
ACTIONS
THEY
DID
THAT
IS
THE
UNDENIABLE
TRUTH
I
CRIED
FOR
THEM
NOR
WOULD
THEY
HAVE
DIED
IF
THEY
HAD
COME
OUT
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
EMPTY
THAT
IS
UNDENIABLE
TRUTH
MY
HEART
BLEEDS
JUST
AS
MUCH
AS
YOURS
FOR
THE
CHILDREN
WHO
WERE
NEVER
RELEASED
GIVEN
DAYS
OF
AMPLE
OPPORTUNITIES
TO
DO
SO
MY
HEART
ALSO
BLEEDS
FOR
PEOPLE
SO
BLINDED
BY
RELIGIOUS
DEVOTION
TO
NOT
HAVE
THE
COMMON
SENSE
TO
LEAVE
THE
COMPOUND
WHEN
TANKS
CAME
UP
AND
STARTED
DROPPING
IN
TEAR
GAS
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
YOU
SEEM
TO
SAY
THEY
GOT
WHAT
THEY
DESERVED
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THIS
HOWEVER
IF
THEY
DID
SET
THE
FIRE
WHICH
STARTED
IN
MORE
THAN
ONE
PLACE
AND
SPREAD
VERY
QUICKLY
THEN
THEY
GOT
WHAT
THEY
WANTED
AND
PUT
INTO
MOTION
THEMSELVES
I
SEE
THE
BATF
IS
GOING
TO
BE
INVESTIGATED
BY
THE
JUSTICE
DEPT
AND
LIKELY
BY
ARLEN
SPECTRE
AND
CONGRESS
THIS
IS
GOOD
THEY
HAVE
BUNGLED
THE
AFFAIR
FROM
THE
START

I
