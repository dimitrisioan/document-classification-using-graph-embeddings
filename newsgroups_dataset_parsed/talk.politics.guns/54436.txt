nra
address
could
someone
email
me
a
usnail
address
for
the
nra
id
like
to
write
them
a
letter
encouraging
them
to
see
to
it
very
emphatically
that
the
amendment
is
restored
to
the
form
that
the
founding
fathers
intended
people
like
howard
metzenbaum
seem
very
intent
on
diluting
the
amendment
to
the
point
where
it
is
no
effort
for
the
governmentski
to
do
what
they
did
in
waco
after
all
from
what
i
know
of
the
federalist
papers
it
is
this
kind
of
tyranny
the
amendment
was
supposed
to
be
designed
to
protect
against
honestly
tanks
against
the
civilian
population
attack
helicopters
we
need
the
right
to
keep
and
bear
antitank
weapons
actually
if
they
intend
to
mass
armour
against
the
weaklyarmed
at
that
civilian
population
we
need
the
right
to
field
tactical
nukes
government
tyranny
who
would
have
ever
thought
it
would
happen
here
i
wonder
whose
house
theyll
run
tanks
through
next
because
the
gov
suspects
child
abuse
maybe
yours
maybe
mine
and
what
is
an
illegal
weapon
which
they
have
yet
to
show
us
if
the
amendment
is
designed
to
do
what
i
believe
it
is
and
the
gov
uses
tanks
against
you
government
selfserving
naaaah
not
here
time
was
when
the
us
used
armourattack
helicopters
against
small
countries
now
were
down
to
using
them
against
to
what
amounts
to
a
busload
and
a
half
of
civilians
first
they
came
for
the
jews
but
i
did
not
stop
them
because
i
was
not
a
jew
then
they
came
for
the
catholics
but
i
did
not
stop
them
because
i
was
not
a
catholic
then
they
came
for
the
lutherans
but
there
was
now
no
one
left
to
stop
them
rev
martin
niemoller
probably
didnt
get
it
verbatim
but
you
get
the
idea
if
the
nra
reads
this
then
never
mind
about
the
address
