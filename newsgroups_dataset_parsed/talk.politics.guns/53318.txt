I
DONT

SUCH

IS

AN
EXHAUSTIVE

HAS
ALREADY
BEEN

AND
SEATTLE
WASHINGTON
CITIES
WITH
ROUGHLY
THE

AND

BUT
WITH
DECIDEDLY
DIFFERENT
APPROACHES

DO
NOT

ROUGHLY

AMONG

THE
RELATIVE
RISK
OF
BEING
A

OF

IN

AS
COMPARED
TO
VANCOUVER
WAS

TO
BE
HOWEVER
IF
YOU

DIFFERENCES
THE

DISAPPEARS
COMPLETELY
SEATTLES
MINORITIES
ARE
PREDOMINATLY
POOR
WHILE
VANCOUVERS
ARE
MIDDLE

UPPER

THE
RATES
FOR
WHITES
IN
BOTH
CITIES
WERE

TO
BE
IDENTICLE

THE
RATE
FOR

SEATTLE
MINORITIES
WAS
ALMOST
THREE
TIMES
AS
GREAT
AS
FOR
THE

OF

THE

SEEMS
TO

THE

ALSO

HOMICIDES

ONLY
SUCH
HOMICIDES
OCCURRED
DURING
THE

OF
WHICH
WERE
COMMITTED
BY

ONLY
CASES
OF

ACTING
IN

OCCURRRED
THAT
IS
A
GROSS
DISTORTION
SELFDEFENSE
DOES
NOT
MEAN
KILLING
THE
ATTACKER
THERE
WERE
CASES
OF
CIVILIANS
KILLING
THEIR
ATTACKER
IN
SELFDEFENCE
BUT
SUCH
CASES
REPRESENT
LESS
THAT
OF
THE
CRIMES
PREVENTED
BY
ARMED
SELFDEFENCE
FOR
EVERY
CASE
YOU
CITE
THERE
WERE
OVER
OTHER
CASES
OF
SELFDEFENCE
WHERE
THE
CRIME
WAS
PREVENTED
BUT
THE

WAS
NOT
KILLED
BY
THE
WAY
IS

SURVEYS
ESTIMATE
OF

PREVENTED

SELFDEFENCE
EACH

MOST
OTHER

ON

PUT
THE
FIGURE
AT
TO
THOSE
FIGURES
WOULD
IMPLY
LESS
THAN
OF
SUCESSFUL
SELFDEFENCES
INVOLVE
KILLING
THE

SO
MORE
CORRECTLY
THERE
OVER
POSSIBLY
AS
MANY
AS
CASES
OF
CIVILIANS
ACTING
IN
SELFDEFENCE
ONLY
OF
WHICH
RESULTED
IN
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
ATTACKER
THIS
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
FACTOR
IN
COMPARISON
TO
THE
HOMICIDES
IF
MEMORY
SERVES
HOMICIDES
MAKE
UP
APPROXIMATELY
OF
THE
VIOLENT
CRIMES
THE
STUDY
CONSIDERED
SO
THE
FAIR
COMPARISON
WOULD
BE
HOMICIDES
PREVENTED
AND
HOMICIDES
CLEARLY
THE
STUDY
CAN
NOT
BE
CLOSE
TO
ACCURATE
SINCE
IT
IGNORED
