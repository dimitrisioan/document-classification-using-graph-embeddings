LETTER
TO
DAVID
SKAGGS
HERE
IS
A
LETTER
I
SENT
TO
DAVID
SKAGGS
DEM
CO
BEFORE
ANYBODY
SAYS
SOMETHING
YES
THE
LETTER
IS
A
BIT
SHARP
IN
TONE
I
HAVE
BEEN
WRITTING
REASONABLE
AND
POLITE
LETTERS
TO
HIM
FOR
YEARS
AND
ALL
I
GET
IN
RETURN
IN
THE
HCI
PARTY
LINE
SINCE
HE
ALREADY
IS
NRA
F
RATED
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
UPSETTING
HIM
WILL
HARM
THE
CAUSE
SORRY
IF
YOU
DISAGREE
BUT
RECENT
EVENTS
IN
TEXAS
REALLY
HAVE
ME
PISSED
APRIL
REPRESENTATIVE
SKAGGS
RECENTLY
I
WROTE
TO
YOU
REGARDING
MY
OUTRAGE
OVER
THE
TACTICS
USED
BY
THE
BUREAU
OF
ALCOHOL
TOBACCO
AND
FIREARMS
BATF
IN
TEXAS
IN
YOUR
RESPONSE
YOU
STATED
THAT
EVENTS
IN
TEXAS
UNDERSCORE
THE
NEED
FOR
STRICTER
GUN
CONTROL
LEGISLATION
TO
KEEP
GUNS
OUT
OF
THE
HAND
OF
GROUPS
SUCH
AS
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
MY
QUESTION
TO
YOU
IS
WHAT
GROUNDS
WOULD
YOU
USE
TO
DENY
THEM
ACCESS
TO
FIREARMS
BEST
I
CAN
TELL
THIS
STATEMENT
UNDERSCORES
YOUR
APPARENT
TOTAL
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
SUBJECT
AND
HIGHLIGHTS
YOUR
PERSONAL
BIAS
AGAINST
FIREARMS
I
SAY
THIS
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
ONLY
TWO
POSSIBLE
PATHS
OF
GUN
CONTROL
WHICH
YOU
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
REFERENCING
EITHER
YOU
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THEIR
ACCESS
TO
SEMIAUTOMATICS
FIREARMS
IN
THIS
CASE
I
SHOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
SEMIAUTOMATIC
FIREARMS
ARE
LEGAL
IN
MOST
AREAS
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
INCLUDING
TEXAS
AND
COLORADO
IN
ADDITION
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
CULT
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
CONVICTED
OF
ANY
CRIMES
WHICH
WOULD
DENY
THEM
THE
ABILITY
TO
PURCHASE
THESE
WEAPONS
SO
UNDER
WHAT
GROUNDS
WOULD
YOU
DENY
THEM
THESE
GUNS
THEIR
RELIGION
THE
FACT
THEY
THEY
LIVE
IN
A
LARGE
GROUP
ALONE
BY
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
YOU
CONSIDER
THEM
TO
BE
A
CULT
MAYBE
I
CONSIDER
YOUR
CHURCH
TO
BE
A
CULT
THIS
LINE
OF
REASONING
BY
YOU
BORDERS
ON
THE
CONCEPT
OF
THOUGHT
CRIMES
YOU
AND
PAT
ROBERTSON
SHOULD
REALLY
GET
ALONG
YOU
WERE
REFERRING
TO
THE
ALLEGED
FULLY
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
POSSESSED
BY
THE
CULT
UNDER
CURRENT
US
LAW
FULLY
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
HAVE
BEEN
COVERED
BY
SOME
OF
THE
STRICTEST
GUN
CONTROL
LAWS
IN
THIS
NATION
SO
IF
DAVID
KORESH
ILLEGALLY
POSSESSED
THEM
HE
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
CIRCUMVENT
SOME
OF
THE
STRICTEST
LAWS
WE
HAVE
HOW
WILL
MORE
LAWS
HELP
BY
THE
WAY
IT
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
POSSESSED
A
FEDERAL
FIREARMS
LICENSE
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
PERMITTED
HIM
TO
POSSESS
FULLY
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
IF
TRUE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
PERISHED
MONDAY
IN
THE
FIRE
DIED
SO
THAT
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
COULD
COLLECT
A
COUPLE
HUNDRED
DOLLARS
IN
TAXES
ON
GUNS
DAVID
KORESH
DIDNT
DECLARE
I
HAVE
HEARD
CLAIMS
THAT
THEY
WERE
STOCKPILING
WEAPONS
YET
CONSIDERING
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMPLEX
EVEN
WEAPONS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
OUT
OF
LINE
WITH
GUN
OWNERSHIP
STATISTICS
FOR
ALL
OF
TEXAS
WHATS
NEXT
A
SIEGE

ALLEGED

IT
DAVID

YOU

VIRTUALLY

YET
YOU

THAT
