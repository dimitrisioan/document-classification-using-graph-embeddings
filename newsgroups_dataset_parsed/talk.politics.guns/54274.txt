AFTER
WHICH
WE
WOULD
BE
SQUASHED
INTO
AN
INADEQUATE

ONE

SOMEWHAT
OFFENSIVELY
SMARMY
HE

AGAIN
THE

ORGANIZED
EVERY

IM
FROM
YOUR

AT
YOUR
SECOND

ARRIVED
IN
TIME
TO
NOTICE
A
DEMONSTRATION
GOING
ON
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
STATEHOUSE
WHERE
THE
PROGUNNERS
WERENT
RANDY
PRICE
FROM
THE
TV
NEWS
WAS
THERE
IN
HIS
MIRROR
REFLECTIVE
SHADES
TALKING
TO
ONE
OF
THE
ANTIGUN
TYPES
AND
SEVERAL
SIMONS
ROCK
ANTIGUN
CLOSETHELOOPHOLE
PROTESTORS
EARLIER
RANDY
HAD
COVERED
THE
GOAL
RALLY
THE
ROOM
WE
HAD
BEEN
ASSIGNED
SEATED
ABOUT
REMEMBER
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
GUN
OWNERS
THERE
PLUS
ANOTHER
STUDENTS
AND
TEACHERS
FROM
BARD
ONE
OF
US
HAD
ALREADY
RESERVED
A
SEAT
THE
OTHER
NEVER
GOT
CLOSER
THAN
THE
ATRIUM
OUTSIDE
AND
THERE
WAS
A
CROWD
BEHIND
HIM
A
COP
TOOK
UP
STATION
AT
THE
ENTRANCE
AND
PREVENTED
THE
REST
OF
THE
CROWD
FROM
COMING
IN
SOON
AFTER
THE
DEBATE
STARTED
A
LOUDSPEAKER
WAS
SET
UP
OUTSIDE
IN
THE
HALL
FOR
THE
BENEFIT
OF
EVERYONE
ELSE
EVERYONE
WHO
WAS
THERE
INSIDE
AND
OUTSIDE
GOT
TO
SIGN
UP
ON
A
SHEET
SAYING
WHAT
THEIR
POSITION
WAS
ON
WHICH
BILLS
MOST
OF
US
SIGNED
UP
TO
SUPPORT
GOALS
POSITION
ON
ALL
BILLS
FIRST
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
TIME
CONSTRAINTS
PUBLIC
OFFICIALS
GOT
TO
TESTIFY
AND
FIRST
UP
WAS
THE
BILL
THAT
NOBODY
HAD
SEEN
THE
STUDENTS
HAD
SOME
CURFEW
I
GUESS
CURRENTLY
MASSACHUSETTS
LAW
ALLOWS
A
NONRESIDENT
TO
PURCHASE
LONG
GUNS
OR
AMMO
FROM
A
LOCAL
DEALER
PROVIDED
HE
COMPLIES
WITH
THE
LAWS
OF
HIS
OWN
STATE
PREVIOUSLY
THE
LAW
WAS
SIMILAR
BUT
APPLIED
ONLY
TO
NONRESIDENTS
FROM
STATES
ADJOINING
MASSACHUSETTS
THE
SIMONS
ROCK
FOLKS
CALLED
THE
CURRENT
LAW
A
LOOPHOLE
AND
WANTED
IT
CLOSED
TWO
OF
THEIR
REPS
SPOKE
ABOUT
WAYNE
LO
AND
HIS
SKS
ASSAULT
RIFLE
THE
SECOND
ONE
HODGEKISS
A
COSPONSOR
HAD
DONE
HIS
HOMEWORK
SO
WELL
THAT
HE
KEPT
CONFUSING
MONTANA
WAYNE
LOS
HOME
STATE
WITH
MISSOURI
AND
BECAME
BELLIGERENT
WHEN
ABOUT
FIVE
GUN
OWNERS
IN
THE
GALLERY
CORRECTED
HIM
AFTER
HIS
SECOND
MUFF
CARR
FROM
GLOUCESTER
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
NEW
BILL
WOULD
PUT
THE
LAW
BACK
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
BUT
HE
WAS
LYING
THE
NEW
BILL
ALLOWS
PURCHASES
BY
NONRESIDENTS
OF
ADJOINING
STATES
ONLY
IF
THEY
HAVE
LICENSING
IN
THEIR
OWN
STATE
AS
STRONG
AS
THAT
IN
MASSACHUSETTS
SINCE
NONE
OF
THEM
DO
THATS
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
THESE
TWO
SAID
WERE
REALLY
OFFENSIVE
IN
SOME
OF
THESE
OTHER
STATES
ANYONE
CAN
BUY
A
GUN
AS
LONG
AS
HES
BREATHING
OOOOOO
WE
HAVE
SOME
VERY
VERY
GOOD
GUN
LAWS
IN
MASSACHUSETTS
IF
ONLY
THE
OTHER
STATES
WOULD
ADOPT
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
LAWS
WE
WOULDNT
BE
HAVING
THIS
SITUATION
BUT
THEY
WONT
NAUGHTY
NAUGHTY
NEXT
UP
WAS
BOSTON
CITY
COUNCILMAN
ALBERT
DAPPER
ONEILL
HE
WAS
THERE
TO
TESTIFY
PROGUN
BUT
IN
SOME
WAYS
HE
WAS
A
LIABILITY
HES
REASONABLY
ELDERLY
AND
TENDS
TO
WANDER
AND
REPEAT
HIMSELF
PLUS
HES
ALMOST
A
CARICATURE
OF
A
LAWNORDER
POLITICIAN
HE
BADMOUTHED
THE
ACLU
SAID
VIOLENT
CRIMINALS
SHOULD
BE
EXECUTED
AND
THAT
IF
HE
WERE
JUDGE
HED
GIVE
ARRESTEES
THEIR
LAST
RIGHTS
PUN
INTENDED
ON
THE
SPOT
AT
WHICH
MANY
OF
THE
GUN
OWNERS
APPLAUDED
WHICH
BOTHERED
ME
HE
SAID
THAT
ALL
THE
PROPOSED
GUN
RESTRICTIONS
WERE
A
STEP
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
FOR
THE
CRIMINALS
HE
SAID
THIS
FOUR
TIMES
TWO
OF
THE
BILLS
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
WOULD
ALLOW
POLICE
TO
RESCIND
A
CCW
OR
FID
AND
CONFISCATE
ALL
YOUR
GUNS
IF
SOMEONE
HAD
FILED
A
RESTRAINING
ORDER
AGAINST
YOU
NOTE
THAT
THE
FILING
OF
A
RESTRAINING
ORDER
REQUIRES
NO
WARRANT
NO
HEARING
NO
EVIDENCE
AND
NO
CONVICTION
JUST
AN
ACCUSATION
SENATOR
BARRETT
OF
READING
TESTIFIED
IN
FAVOR
OF
IT
AND
PATRONIZED
THE
PROGUNNERS
THERE
SEVERAL
TIMES
BY
SAYING
IM
SURE
ALL
THE
GUN
OWNERS
HERE
WILL
AGREE
WITH
ME
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
GET
THESE
WEAPONS
OUT
OF
THE
HANDS
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
OUR
COURTS
HAVE
CONVICTED
I
HAVENT
SEEN
SUCH
A
DISGUSTINGLY
DISINGENUOUS
PERFORMANCE
SINCE
NIXON
WHINED
THAT
HE
WASNT
A
CROOK
BARRETT
ALSO
SPOKE
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
BILL
MAKING
THE
FID
CARD
RENEWABLE
EVERY
FIVE
YEARS
INSTEAD
OF
PERMANENT
AS
IT
IS
NOW
THE
STATED
PURPOSE
IS
TO
REMOVE
FID
CARDS
FROM
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
BECOME
INELIGIBLE
REVENUE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
YEAH
RIGHT
APPARENTLY
SOME
CONGRESSMEN
THINK
WERE
STUPID
ENOUGH
TO
SWALLOW
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
ITS
PREFERABLE
TO
PROCESS
MILLION
RENEWALS
EVERY
CYCLE
IN
THE
VAGUE
HOPE
OF
CATCHING
A
RECENT
FELON
THAN
TO
SIMPLY
TAKE
THE
GODDAMN
CARD
AWAY
FROM
A
CRIMINAL
AT
CONVICTION
TIME
AS
USUAL
HASSLE
THE
LAWABIDING
INSTEAD
OF
THE
CROOK
THE
TWO
COCHAIRS
OF
THE
COMMITTEE
WERE
REP
CARON
AND
SEN
JUJUGA
JUJUGA
DIDNT
SAY
MUCH
HE
WAS
A
COSPONSOR
OF
BOTH
RESTRAINING
ORDER
BILLS
BUT
CARON
STRUCK
ME
AS
A
SHARP
GUY
THAT
WOULDNT
LET
ANY
BAD
LOGIC
OR
LIES
ON
THE
PART
OF
EITHER
SIDE
TO
GO
UNCHALLENGED
HE
WAS
A
COSPONSOR
OF
ONE
OF
THE
RESTRAINING
ORDER
BILLS
AS
WELL
ONE
OF
THE
YOUNGER
REPS
ON
THE
COMMITTEE
FORGOT
HIS
NAME
WAS
VOCIFEROUSLY
PROGUN
SOMEWHAT
EMBARRASSINGLY
SO
HIS
HEART
WAS
IN
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
BUT
HIS
ARGUMENTS
SEEMED
TO
BE
CONFINED
TO
EVERY
YEAR
ITS
THE
SAME
DAMN
THING
YOU
COME
IN
HERE
WITH
THIS
CRAP
ITS
NICE
TO
HAVE
A
FRIEND
ON
THE
COMMITTEE
BUT
HE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
EFFECTIVE
AT
ABOUT
IT
WAS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
HALLJAM
COULDNT
CONTINUE
SOMEONE
CAME
OUT
OF
ANOTHER
MEETING
HALL
AND
YELLED
AT
THE
COP
BECAUSE
THE
LOUDSPEAKER
WAS
DISTURBING
THEIR
MEETING
SO
THE
LOUDSPEAKER
WAS
DISCONNECTED
SO
THEY
FOUND
A
BIGGER
HALL
UPSTAIRS
ONE
OF
US
HAD
TO
LEAVE
TO
CATCH
HIS
CHARTER
BUS
AND
SO
MISSED
THE
PUBLIC
TESTIMONY
THE
OTHER
GOT
A
SEAT
THIS
TIME
CARON
BEGAN
BY
TALKING
ABOUT
HOW
HE
GOT
HIS
FID
YEARS
AGO
LEFT
THE
STATE
AND
THEN
RETURNED
WITHOUT
NOTIFYING
THEM
OF
HIS
ADDRESS
CHANGE
HE
COMPLAINED
THAT
THE
STATE
RECORD
SYSTEM
WAS
NOT
UPTODATE
AND
THAT
HIS
PD
BACK
IN
HIS
CITY
OF
BIRTH
STILL
THOUGHT
HE
LIVED
THERE
GREAT
QUOTE
IF
YOU
PURCHASE
A
GUN
TODAY
IT
WILL
NOT
GET
INTO
THE
STATE
COMPUTER
SYSTEM
UNTIL
THIS
WAS
ALSO
AN
ARGUMENT
HE
USED
AGAINST
THE
RENEWABLE
FID
CARD
TESTIMONY
WAS
HEARD
FROM
SEVERAL
BATTERED
WOMEN
ONE
OF
WHOM
HAD
BEEN
ATTACKED
BY
SOME
GUY
IN
HIS
WHO
HAD
AN
FID
CARD
BECAUSE
HE
GOT
IT
WHEN
HE
WAS
OR
THEREABOUTS
THEY
USED
A
LOT
OF
EMOTION
AND
SAID
HOW
THEY
WERE
SCARED
OF
THESE
MEN
A
STAFFER
OF
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
HARSHBARGER
TESTIFIED
IN
FAVOR
OF
THIS
ANTIGUN
BILL
SAYING
HOW
RESTRAINING
ORDERS
WERE
GRANTED
LAST
YEAR
AND
HOW
THESE
WOMEN
NEEDED
TO
BE
PROTECTED
CARON
NOTED
THAT
A
RESTRAINING
ORDER
WAS
GRANTED
FOR
DAYS
AND
THEN
A
HEARING
WAS
HELD
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
THE
ORDER
WOULD
BE
EXTENDED
TO
A
YEAR
HE
ASKED
WHETHER
SHE
WOULD
BE
SATISFIED
IF
THE
FID
WERE
REVOKED
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THIS
HEARING
RATHER
THAN
AFTER
THE
INITIAL
ISSUANCE
OF
THE
FID
SHE
GAVE
SOME
LONG
RAMBLING
CIRCUMLOCUTION
IN
RESPONSE
THEN
TESTIMONY
AGAINST
THE
BILL
WAS
HEARD
MIKE
YACINO
WHO
LOOKS
SOMETHING
LIKE
EINSTEIN
GOT
UP
AND
MADE
THE
POINT
THAT
RESTRAINING
ORDERS
WERE
ISSUED
ON
TOO
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
THAT
JUDGES
LIKE
TO
ISSUE
RESTRAINING
ORDERS
JUST
TO
LET
THINGS
COOL
OFF
NO
MATTER
WHO
THEY
THINK
IS
RIGHT
MAN
OR
WOMAN
AND
THAT
THE
HEARINGS
FOR
RESTRAINING
ORDERS
ARE
LIGHTNING
SESSIONS
WITH
LITTLE
TIME
TO
CONSIDER
FACTS
ATTY
KAREN
MCNUTT
SPOKE
WITH
HIM
A
FEW
TIMES
DURING
HIS
TESTIMONY
OTHER
PROGUNNERS
GOT
UP
TO
TESTIFY
ONE
SAID
HE
HAD
HAD
TO
FILE
A
RESTRAINING
ORDER
AGAINST
A
TENANT
TO
CLEAR
HER
OUT
AND
THAT
SHE
COUNTERED
BY
FILING
ONE
AGAINST
HIM
HE
NOTED
THAT
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
ALLOWED
THE
STATE
TO
CONFISCATE
HIS
GUNS
IF
THE
NEW
BILL
BECAME
LAW
ONE
OF
THE
JUNIOR
REPS
NOTED
THAT
THIS
IS
AMERICA
AND
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CERTAIN
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
RIGHTS
ARE
RESPECTED
SENATOR
JUJUGA
REITERATED
THIS
SAYING
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO
ABUSE
SMALLER
PEOPLE
CAN
GO
TO
HELL
AS
FAR
AS
I
CARE
BUT
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
EQUATING
CONVICTION
WITH
A
RESTRAINING
ORDER
POINT
AND
MATCH
SENATOR
ANOTHER
PROGUNNER
GOT
UP
AND
TESTIFIED
THAT
HE
DIDNT
KNOW
HIS
CITIZENSHIP
EXPIRED
EVERY
YEARS
AND
THAT
A
DRIVERS
LICENSE
WAS
A
PRIVILEGE
NOT
A
RIGHT
LIKE
THE
RIGHT
TO
KEEP
AND
BEAR
ARMS
A
THIRD
GOT
UP
AND
SAID
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
WITH
THE
CRIMINAL
JUSTICE
SYSTEM
AND
ARGUED
IN
FAVOR
OF
A
DEATH
PENALTY
BILL
AND
PUBLIC
HANGINGS
SENATOR
JUJUGA
SAID
HE
HAD
HIMSELF
TRIED
TO
GET
A
DEATH
PENALTY
BILL
PASSED
AND
JOKING
RESPONDED
THAT
HE
TOO
FAVORED
PUBLIC
HANGINGS
THE
SPEAKER
THEN
RESPONDED
ILL
MAKE
YOU
A
DEAL
YOU
GET
ME
THE
ROPE
AND
ILL
TIE
THE
NOOSE
NEXT
CAME
PUBLIC
TESTIMONY
ON
THE
SIMONS

THAT
SHE
HAD
BEEN
THE
TEACHER
OF
WAYNE
LO
AND
THAT
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
SHOOT
PEOPLE
INSIDE
A
BUILDING
WHILE
HE
WAS
OUTSIDE
WITHOUT
HIS
EVIL
GUN
SHE
SAID
THAT
THE
LOOPHOLE
SHOULD
BE
CLOSED
TO
PREVENT
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
FROM
EVER
HAPPENING
AGAIN
FOUR
OR
FIVE
OTHER
KIDS
TESTIFIED
IN
FAVOR
OF
THIS
BILL
ONE
OF
SPILLING
TEARS
FOR
THE
GOOD
LEGISLATORS
ONE
OF
THE
STUDENTS
ACTUALLY
SHOT
BY
WAYNE
LO
WAS
ALSO
THERE
MANY
OF
THEM
HAD
T
SHIRTS
ON
SAYING
AS
LONG
AS
ONE
PERSON
CAN
BUY
A
GUN
IN
ANGER
NONE
OF
US
ARE
SAFE
SUPPORT
GUN
CONTROL
THE
COMMITTEE
WAS
RELUCTANT
TO
GRILL
OR
CORRECT
THE
KIDS
EXCEPT
FOR
CARON
WHO
CORRECTED
ONE
STUDENT
WHO
HAD
CLAIMED
THAT
ANYONE
COULD
APPLY
FOR
AN
FID
ONLY
RESIDENTS
CAN
GET
FIDS
HE
SAID
HOW
MUCH
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
BET
THAT
THIS
KID
HAD
NO
IDEA
HE
HAD
BEEN
CONNED
INTO
TESTIFYING
FOR
A
BILL
THAT
WOULD
CUT
OUTOFSTATERS
COMPLETELY
OFF
YACINO
AND
MCNUTT
SPOKE
AGAIN
THIS
TIME
NOTING
THAT
THE
BILL
AS
WRITTEN
WOULD
AFFECT
BOTH
AMMO
AND
ALL
GUNS
POSSESSED
BY
OUTOFSTATERS
KAREN
ALSO
NOTED
THAT
HUNTERS
IN
CT
NH
AND
VT
COULD
BE
PUT
AWAY
FOR
A
YEAR
IF
THEY
WANDERED
ACROSS
THE
MA
BOUNDARY
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
WOODS
AND
GOT
CHALLENGED
BY
GAME
WARDENS
YACINO
UNDERSCORED
THE
FACT
THAT
LO
COULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
AN
FID
AS
A
RESIDENT
STUDENT
AND
HELL
EVEN
AN
CCW
AS
HE
HAD
NO
CRIMINAL
OR
MENTAL
RECORD
ONE
JUNIOR
REP
WAS
UPSET
THAT
IT
WOULD
TAKE
MA
RESIDENTS
LONGER
TO
BUY
A
GUN
THAN
OUTOFSTATERS
AND
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
ELITIST
ANOTHER
CARON
SAID
THAT
WE
NEED
THE
PROTECTION
OF
PREVENTING
NONRESIDENTS
FROM
BUYING
WITHOUT
AN
FID
BECAUSE
ONLY
TWO
OTHER
STATES
IN
THE
UNION
HAD
FIDTYPE
CARDS
SO
COMPLYING
WITH
ALL
THE
LAWS
OF
ONES
HOME
STATE
WAS
NOT
ENOUGH
ONE
PROGUN
SPEAKER
REPLIED
THAT
THIS
RESEMBLED
A
MOTHER
WATCHING
HER
SON
IN
A
MARCHING
BAND
AND
EXCLAIMING
EVERYONES
OUT
OF

BUT
JOHNNY
ALL
THE
BARD

WERE
FILING
OUT
AS
THE
PROGUN
TESTIMONY
FOR
THIS

WAS
MADE
AND
THUS
ONLY
PROGUNNERS
WERE
AROUND
WHEN
THE

NOTED
THAT
