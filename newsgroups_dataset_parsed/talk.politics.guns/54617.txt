saw
a
real
interesting
report
on
cnn
last
night
it
seems
the
gas
that
was
used
has
been
banned
by
international
law
for
military
use
however
our
president
was
quick
to
point
out
that
there
are
exemptions
for
law
enforcement
hmmm
too
inhumane
to
use
in
war
against
the
enemy
but
ok
for
civilians
whoa
think
twice
now
unless
you
want
the
same
standards
applied
to
hollowpoints

you
