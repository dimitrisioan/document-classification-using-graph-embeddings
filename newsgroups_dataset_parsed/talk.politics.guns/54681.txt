RE
WI
AND
IL
FIREARMS
LAW
QUESTIONS
QUESTION
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
IN
EVANSTON
IL
THEY
HAVE
A
ORDINANCE
BANNING
HANDGUNS
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
TO
GET
AROUND
THIS
PROVISION
WHY
DONT
YOU
CALL
THE
CITY
AND
ASK
OAK
PARK
ALSO
HAS
AN
ILLEGAL
HANDGUN
BAN
AS
WELL
BUT
DOES
ALLOW
THOSE
WITH
A
COLLECTORS
FFL
TO
POSSESS
COLLECTIBLE
HANDGUNS
WHAT
WOULD
THE
PENALTY
IF
YOU
WERE
FOUND
OUT
BE
PROBABLY
A
FINE
IN
PRACTICAL
TERMS
WHAT
IF
YOU
USED
SAID
HANDGUN
IN
A
DEFENSIVE
SHOOTING
IN
YOUR
APARTMENT
THERE
HOW
WOULD
THE
CITY
LAW
APPLY
TO
YOUR
IMPENDING
TRIAL
FOR
THE
SHOOTING
IT
WOULDNT
IMPEDE
YOUR
DEFENSE
AT
ALL
THERE
WAS
AN
ACTUAL
INCIDENT
IN
OAK
PARK
WHERE
A
GAS
STATION
OWNER
ENGAGED
IN
A
SHOOTOUT
WITH
A
HANDGUN
THE
GRAND
JURY
DECIDED
NOT
TO
PRESECUTE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
A
BLACK
MAN
USED
AN
ILLEGALLY
OWNED
HANDGUN
IN
OAK
PARK
TO
DEFEND
HIMSELF
AND
THE
VILLAGE
TRIED
TO
MAKE
AN
EXAMPLE
OUT
OF
HIM
AN
NRA
DIRECTOR
WHO
LIVED
THERE
MADE
A
STINK
ABOUT
THIS
AND
IT
WAS
DECIDED
NOT
TO
CHARGE
THE
GUY
OF
COURSE
PISSING
OFF
ANTIGUN
POLICE
THUGS
HAS
ITS
OWN
DRAWBACKS
LIKE
WHEN
THE
OAK
PARK
POLICE
CHIEF
CAME
TO
HIS
HOUSE
AND
TOLD
HIM
THIS
IS
STEPPING
OVER
THE
LINE
THIS
COULD
GET
DANGEROUS
FOR
YOU
WHEREUPON
THE
FEW
BLACK
OAK
PARK
POLICE
OFFICERS
WATCHED
OVER
HIS
HOUSE
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
WHITE
ANTIGUN
POLICE
CHIEF
AND
HIS
ANTIGUN
CRONIES
WOULDNT
FCK
WITH
HIM
HIS
HOME
OR
FAMILY
ALSO
WHAT
IS
IL
STATE
LAW
CONCERNING
SHORT
BARRELED
WEAPONS
SHORT
BARRELED
SHOTGUN
IS
WHAT
I
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
IN
IF
A
HANDGUN
WERE
NOT
AVAILABLE
EITHER
THAT
OR
A
SHORTENED
CARBINE
IE
COLT
MARLIN
LV
CIPRIANI
STATES
THAT
THE
ANY
OTHER
WEAPON
CATEGORY
IS
ALLOWED
BUT
THE
EXACT
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
AN
ITHACA
AUTOBURGULAR
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
IS
IN
THE
ANY
OTHER
WEAPON
CATEGORY
AND
A
CHOPPED
BARREL
HK
CLASS
FOR
SURE
IS
NOT
CLEAR
TO
ME
ONE
MORE
THING
WHAT
IS
THE
CHANCE
OF
GETTING
A
CCW
PERMIT
IN
IL
WITHOUT
BEING
RICH
OR
FAMOUS
OR
RELATED
TO
THE
MAYOR
IN
YOUR
DREAMS
BUDDY
AS
LONG
AS
DEMOCRATS
REIGN
IN
CHICAGO
ILLINOIS
RESIDENTS
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
DISARMED
AND
HELPLESS
IN
THE
STREETS
POLITICIANS
GET
AROUND
THIS
BY
PROVISIONS
IN
THE
LAW
THAT
ALLOW
THEM
TO
CARRY
CONCEALED
WEAPONS
VOTERS
IN
CHICAGO
ARE
TOO
STUPID
TO
VOTE
THESE
AHOLES
OUT
OF
OFFICE
BECAUSE
THE
DEMS
ARE
ALWAYS
IN
POWER
THE
ILLINOIS
SUPREME
COURT
IS
ALWAYS
TILTED
TO
THE
DEMOCRATIC
PARTYS
VIEWS
ON
GUNS
ALL
CANDIDATES
SUPPORTED
BY
POLITICAL
CONSULTANT
DAVID
AXELROD
ARE
ANTIGUN
WHICH
EXPLAINS
ANTIRKBA
CROOK
COUNTY
STATES
ATTORNEY
JACKASS
OMALLEY
BEING
A
SOCALLED
REPUBLICAN
GET
RID
OF
THE
CHICAGO
DEMOCRATS
GET
RID
OF
THEIR
MEMBERS
ON
THE
IL
JUDICIARY
AND
YOU
GOT
A
FIGHTING
CHANCE
OF
A
PREEMPTION
LAW
AND
A
CCW
LAW
