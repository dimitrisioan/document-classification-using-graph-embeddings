re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
in
article

andy
freeman
says
in
article
jason
kratz
the
point
that
i
forgot
to
bring
up
here
and
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
g
bein
a
gang
member
or
not
is
that
it
is
illegal
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
in
s
thi
area
or
in
the
state
of
illinois
for
that
matter
right
it
nas
nothing
to
do
with
whther
or
not
the
person
iswas
a
gang
member
but
thats
what
kratz
inferred
wrong
there
are
people
who
can
legally
carry
concealed
in
il
and
there
are
circumstances
under
which
many
people
can
carry
concealed
is
accuracy
really
too
much
to
expect
andy
no
its
not
if
you
would
have
read
my
other
post
i
was
accurate
heres
what
i
said
material
from
another
post
the
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
because
i
know
its
true
looked
this
one
up
in
the
illinois
this
is
for
you
andy
statutes
before
is
that
it
is
illegal
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
in
illinois
also
for
you
andy
and
then
i
went
on
to
say
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
ccw
for
us
ordinary
folk
here
end
of
quoted
material
of
course
i
forgot
to
mention
who
us
ordinary
folk
are
so
just
for
andy
im
going
to
go
to
the
library
tomorrow
and
photocopy
the
part
of
the
illinois
statutes
with
this
information
and
post
it
ordinary
citizens
can
not
get
a
license
to
carry
a
concealed
weapon
there
are
very
few
people
who
can
i
even
asked
my
lawyer
friend
about
this
and
he
told
me
that
only
certain
people
can
get
licenses
for
concealed
carry
he
couldnt
remember
which
people
but
he
knew
for
sure
that
regular
citizens
couldnt
get
that
type
of
license
he
told
me
to
go
check
at
the
library
for
the
statutes
which
i
did
ill
post
that
info
tomorrow
night
until
then
