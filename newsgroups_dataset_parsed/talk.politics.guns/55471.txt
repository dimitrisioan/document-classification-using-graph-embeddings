says
from
memory
todays
houston
chronicle
april
reported
that
hb
passed
in
the
texas
house
of
representatives
with
approximately
this
is
from
memory
votes
for
and
votes
against
what
does
this
bill
do
however
in
an
effort
to
go
into
cya
thats
cover
your
ass
mode
they
wrote
the
bill
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
law
subject
to
a
statewide
referendum
in
november
however
the
paper
reported
that
this
is
actually
unconstitutional
under
the
texas
constitution
which
only
allows
referendums
for
constitutional
amendments
not
for
plain
old
laws
if
the
court
does
not
permit
the
referendum
the
bill
will
probably
go
into
effect
with
little
fanfare
all
of
the
above
is
subject
to
the
texas
senates
voting
for
the
bill
as
well
time
to
start
calling
the
state
senators
now
