RE
JANET
RENO
ON
NIGHTLINE
IN
ARTICLE
FINNISIEDU
GREG
FINN
WRITES
I
AM
BOTHERED
BY
THE
SUGGESTION
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
THAT
JANET
RENO
USED
SEVERAL
TIMES
LAST
NIGHT
BOTH
ON
AND
OFF
NIGHTLINE
AS
A
DE
FACTO
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
APPROVING
THE
RAID
IF
THAT
IS
TO
BE
USED
AS
A
JUSTIFICATION
OF
POTENTIALLY
LETHAL
FORCE
ATTACK
ON
THE
COMPOUND
AND
DOING
STRUCTURAL
DAMAGE
CAN
FAIRLY
BE
CALLED
THAT
THEN
THAT
EVIDENCE
HAD
BETTER
BE
QUITE
STRONG
THAT
SEEMED
TO
BE
ON
TED
KOPELS
MIND
LAST
NIGHT
RENO
STATED
THAT
THEY
HAD
EVIDENCE
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
SHE
WOULD
NOT
SAY
WHAT
IT
WAS
KORESHS
NOW
EXLAWYER
WAS
INSIDE
THE
COMPOUND
REPEATEDLY
AND
TOLD
HER
TO
HER
FACE
LAST
NIGHT
THAT
HE
SAW
PLENTY
OF
HAPPY
CHILDREN
PLAYING
WITH
THEIR
MOTHERS
AND
NO
SIGNS
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
WHATSOEVER
NO
BROODING
SILENT
CHILDREN
NO
APPARENT
BRUISING
AND
SO
ON
HER
REPLY
TO
THIS
WAS
THAT
CHILD
ABUSE
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
AS
EVIDENT
AS
THAT
TRUE
BUT
WHAT
BETTER
EVIDENCE
COULD
THE
FBI
HAVE
HAD
AT
THIS
POINT
IT
SEEMS
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
HOW
THE
FBI
COULD
HAVE
HAD
BETTER
EVIDENCE
THAN
THAT
SEEN
BY
KORESHS
LAWYER
WHO
WAS
AN
EYE
WITNESS
HAVING
LIVED
IN
LA
AND
SEEN
THE
MEDIA
AND
AUTHORITY
FEEDING
FRENZY
THAT
ACCOMPANIED
THE
MCMARTIN
PRESCHOOL
DEBACLE
I
HAVE
SEEN
JUST
HOW
HOT
A
BUTTON
A
CHILD
ABUSE
CHARGE
CAN
BE
CHILD
ABUSE
HAS
BEEN
USED
BEFORE
BY
AUTHORITIES
AS
A
JUSTIFICATION
TO
DISCARD
PRUDENCE
I
FIND
JANET
RENOS
REPEATED
ASSERTIONS
OF
EVIDENCE
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
RATHER
CURIOUS
WASNT
THE
WARRANT
ISSUED
FOR
A
SUPPOSED
WEAPONS
VIOLATION
THAT
CERTAINLY
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
CHILD
ABUSE
ARE
WE
TO
ASSUME
THEREFORE
THAT
NEW
EVIDENCE
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
AROSE
AFTER
THE
ISSUANCE
OF
THAT
WARRANT
AND
THE
INITIAL
ASSAULT
IF
SO
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
NOW
HOW
THAT
NEW
EVIDENCE
WAS
GATHERED
AND
HOW
IT
COULD
BE
BETTER
THAT
ONSITE
EYE
WITNESS
EVIDENCE
