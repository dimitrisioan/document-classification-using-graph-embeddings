the
massive
destructive
power
of
many
modern
weapons
makes
the
cost
of
an
accidental
or
crimial
usage
of
these
weapons
to
great
the
weapons
of
mass
destruction
need
to
be
in
the
control
of
the
government
only
individual
access
would
result
in
the
needless
deaths
of
millions
this
makes
the
right
of
the
people
to
keep
and
bear
many
modern

nonexistant
thanks
for
stating
where
youre
coming
from
needless
to
say
i
disagree
on
every
count
you
believe
that
individuals
should
have
the
right
to
own
weapons
of
mass
destruction
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
you
would
support
a
neighbors
right
to
keep
nuclear
weapons
biological
weapons
and
nerve
gas
on
hisher
property
if
we
cannot
even
agree
on
keeping
weapons
of
mass
destruction
out
of
the
hands
of
individuals
can
there
be
any
hope
for
us
i
dont
sign
any
blank
checks
when
doug
foxvog
says
weapons
of
mass
destruction
he
means
cbw
and
nukes
when
sarah
brady
says
weapons
of
mass
destruction
she
means
street
sweeper
shotguns
and
semiautomatic
sks
rifles
when
john
lawrence
rutledge
says
weapons
of
mass
destruction
and
then
immediately
follows
it
with
the
us
has
thousands
of
people
killed
each
year
by
handguns
this
number
can
easily
be
reduced
by
putting
reasonable
restrictions
on
them
