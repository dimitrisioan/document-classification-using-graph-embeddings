there
was
no

fire
doing
nothing
was
equally
effective
as
was
yelling
stop
that
of
course
if
one
wants
to
credit
the
tanks
with
stopping
nonexistent
sniper
fire
we
might
was
well
credit
it
with
stopping
an
invasion
by
martians
see
firearms
violence
and
civil
disorders
from
sri
and
sniping
incidents
a
new
pattern
of
violence
from
brandeis
universitys
lemberg
center
for
the
study
of
violence
there
was
precisely
one
verified
sniper
in
the
riots
a
drunk
firing
a
pistol
out
a
window
actually
there
was
only
one
confirmed
sniper
to
die
in
detroit
according
to
sauter
hines
nightmare
in
detroit
a
rebellion
its
what
sources
did
sauter
and
hines
use
in
congressional
hearings
later
the
newspaper
folk
admitted
that
their
reports
were
completely
wrong
some
of
their
excuses
are
understandable
while
others
amount
to
gross
negligence
then
theres
their
we
lied
as
far
as
i
know
they
never
did
the
followup
so
people
other
than
snipers
can
shoot
firemen
if
they
are
shooting
at
snipers
cant
help
blowing
big
holes
in
buildings
that
dont
contain
sniper
nests
or
worrying
about
travelling
sniper
squads
is
a
complete
waste
of
time
interesting
just
curious
they
do
you
believe
that
tanks
did
blow
big
holes
in
buildings
in
detroit
i
dont
have
any
relevant
knowledge
about
the
countersniper
tactics
or
what
the
govt
did
with
the
big
war
toys
thats
why
ive
only
commented
on
what
they
couldnt
have
accomplished
no
matter
what
they
did
nope
the
sniper
fire
was
coming
from
other
policeguard
positions
the
guard
certainly
needed
to
learn
but
i
dont
agree
with
the
idea
that
there
were
no
snipers
at
all
from
p
of
sauter
hines
despite
the
force
of
the
national
guard
in
alliance
with
the
army
troops
the
snipers
did
not
stop
the
snipers
boldly
lay
siege
to
the
fifth
precent
police
station
and
took
pot
shots
at
the
seventh
firemen
were
under
constant
harassment
from
snipers
fired
from
halfclosed
darkened
windows
in
high
apartment
buildings
and
from
rooftops
not
in
detroit
not
during
the
thats
newspaper
copy
and
they
admitted
later
that
they
were
wrong
