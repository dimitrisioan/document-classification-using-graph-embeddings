FROM

UNIVERSITYS
LEMBERG
CENTER
FOR
THE
STUDY
OF

THERE
WAS
PRECISELY
ONE
VERIFIED
SNIPER
IN
THE

ACTUALLY
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
CONFIRMED
SNIPER
TO
DIE
IN
DETROIT
ACCORDING

HINES
NIGHTMARE
IN
DETROIT
A
REBELLION
ITS
WHAT
SOURCES
DID
SAUTER
AND
HINES
USE
IN
CONGRESSIONAL
HEARINGS
LATER
THE
NEWSPAPER
FOLK
ADMITTED
THAT
THEIR
REPORTS
WERE
COMPLETELY
WRONG
SOME
OF
THEIR
EXCUSES
ARE
UNDERSTANDABLE
WHILE
OTHERS
AMOUNT
TO

NEGLIGENCE
THEN
THERES
THEIR
WE
LIED
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THEY
NEVER
DID
THE

CAN
SHOOT

IF
THEY
ARE
SHOOTING
AT

BLOWING

WORRYING
ABOUT

WASTE
OF

INTERESTING
JUST
CURIOUS
THEY
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
TANKS
DID
BLOW
BIG
HOLES
IN

IN

I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
RELEVANT
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
THE
COUNTERSNIPER
TACTICS
OR
WHAT
THE

THATS
WHY

THEY
COULDNT
HAVE
ACCOMPLISHED
NO

WHAT
THEY
DID
NOPE
THE
SNIPER
FIRE
WAS
COMING
FROM
OTHER

POSITIONS
THE

CERTAINLY
NEEDED
TO
LEARN
BUT
I
DONT
AGREE
WITH
THE
IDEA
THAT
THERE
WERE
NO
SNIPERS
AT
ALL
FROM
P
OF
SAUTER
HINES
DESPITE
THE
FORCE
OF
THE
NATIONAL

THE

DID
NOT
STOP
THE
