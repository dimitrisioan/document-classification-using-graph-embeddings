firearms
are
the
fifthleading
cause
of
unintentional
deaths
among
children
ages
and
under
from
the
rkba
archive
total
firearm
deaths
for
children
through
at
is
one
of
the
smallest
causes
of
deaths
in
children
cars
falls
burns
drowning
food
ingestion
are
all
much
larger
cause
of
deaths
so
firearms
are
the
leading
cause
after
drowning
and
choking
on
food
at
least
for
sorry
charlesaccording
to
the
national
safety
council
accident
in
gun
accidents
were
the
fifthleading
cause
of
accidental
death
for
children
ages
and
under
i
dont
understand
how
the
ratio
to
other
accidental
deaths
is
important
so
guns
dont
kill
as
many
children
as
car
accidents
what
is
the
difference
in
severity
between
deaths
and
deaths
the
difference
is
that
a
rational
person
would
address
the
leading
cause
first
and
address
the
lesser
causes
later
that
thinking
is
so
screwed
up
i
dont
even
know
how
to
respond
to
it
a
rational
person
would
concentrate
on
motor
vehicle
deaths
and
not
attempt
to
affect
childhood
falls
drownings
gunshot
injuries
etc
so
this
so
called
rational
person
using
your
definition
if
he
or
she
were
attempting
to
affect
the
leading
causes
of
deaths
for
adults
aged
through
would
only
worry
about
cancer
and
would
not
try
to
decrease
lesser
causes
such
as
heart
disease
injuries
stroke
suicide
liver
disease
chronic
lung
disease
homicide
hiv
infection
or
diabetes
oh
okay
charles
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
i
tell
you
what
charles
ill
call
the
heart
foundation
and
suicide
hotlines
and
tell
them
that
they
are
not
acting
rational
and
that
they
can
all
go
home
because
they
are
addressing
the
lesser
causes
of
death
and
you
call
your
local
police
homicide
department
liver
foundation
and
diabetes
foundation
and
tell
them
to
stop
addressing
these
lesser
causes
please
quit
wasting
my
time
with
this
silly
shit
charles
ive
got
an
idea
charles
why
dont
you
start
a
talkpoliticscaraccidents
group
or
talkpoliticsfall
group
this
is
talkpoliticsguns
dont
confuse
the
issue
just
because
a
social
problem
may
not
claim
as
many
victims
as
another
we
should
not
try
to
address
it
i
dont
agree
im
not
posting
to
tpg
to
debate
the
supposed
severity
of
causes
of
childhood
deaths
i
am
really
getting
frigging
sick
of
having
to
respond
to
the
irrational
statements
of
people
who
assume
that
someone
who
wants
to
discuss
youth
gun
violence
or
unintentional
youth
gun
deaths
is
trying
to
make
a
political
issue
out
of
it
i
assumed
that
any
humane
person
would
be
concerned
when
any
year
old
got
hold
of
their
parents
gun
from
their
bedroom
drawer
and
accidently
blew
away
one
of
their
friends
a
humane
person
who
keeps
a
firearm
in
the
house
with
a
year
old
would
also
teach
this
child
how
to
safely
handle
the
firearm
ignorance
is
our
greatest
enemy
again
charles
you
tend
to
confuse
the
issue
and
take
things
out
of
context
for
your
own
purposes
the
statement
that
you
responded
to
above
is
actually
in
reference
to
a
previous
post
by
another
person
who
like
you
expressed
concern
over
making
youth
gun
violence
a
priority
i
guess
maybe
humane
person
and
rational
person
could
be
interchangeable
huh
both
would
be
defined
as
a
person
who
only
addresses
the
social
problem
that
causes
the
greatest
number
of
childhood
deaths
if
that
is
the
case
im
extremely
glad
that
i
am
inhumane
and
irrational
well
joe
i
suggest
that
you
talk
to
the
center
to
prevent
handgun
violence
what
other
sources
of
information
do
you
have
which
confirms
their
data
these
folks
are
well
known
for
misrepresenting
the
facts
perhaps
you
can
verify
their
data
with
the
uniform
crime
report
sorry
charles
the
fbi
uniform
crime
report
is
well
known
for
misrepresenting
the
facts
but
if
you
insist
according
to
the
ucr
firearm
murders
of
youngsters
and
under
increased
percent
between
and
is
the
national
center
for
health
statistics
good
enough
for
you
they
state
that
every
day
american
children
ages
and
under
are
killed
in
gun
accidents
suicides
and
homicides
many
more
are
wounded
or
how
about
the
national
pediatric
trauma
registry
they
say
gunshot
wounds
to
children
ages
and
under
nearly
doubled
in
major
urban
areas
between
and
do
you
also
doubt
the
american
academy
of
pediatrics
charles
they
state
that
gunshot
wounds
among
children
in
urban
areas
increased
from
to
charles
i
hope
you
dont
need
to
be
convinced
that
youth
are
increasingly
victims
of
gun
injuries
and
that
they
have
easy
access
to
guns
if
you
dont
realize
this
fact
i
dont
care
if
you
go
by
cdc
or
fbi
data
or
if
you
go
into
the
homes
schools
and
streets
where
these
kids
are
and
take
a
poll
by
yourself
im
not
going
to
bother
to
try
to
convince
you
its
obvious
that
you
have
ruled
out
any
idea
of
discussing
this
issue
in
a
sane
fashion
and
that
you
are
so
focused
on
trying
to
make
this
a
gun
control
and
political
discussion
i
really
dont
want
to
do
that
or
the
centers
for
disease
control
they
have
firearm
statistics
are
firearms
a
disease
charles
its
obvious
that
you
know
nothing
about
the
cdc
they
dont
just
study
cancer
and
heart
disease
ive
got
news
for
you
interpersonal
gun
violence
is
an
epidemic
in
surgeon
general
c
everett
koop
declared
that
gun
violence
is
as
much
a
public
health
problem
as
cancer
heart
disease
or
auto
accidents
that
you
greatly
underestimate
the
presence
of
guns
in
the
lives
of
youths
in
the
lives
of
youths
or
in
their
schools
i
know
a
number
of
youths
who
have
firearms
present
in
their
lives
is
is
quite
appropriate
to
teach
children
to
safely
handle
firearms
this
is
a
presence
right
what
are
you
trying
to
say
this
innuendo
reminds
me
of
listening
to
bill
clinton
who
the
fk
said
anything
about
teaching
children
to
safely
handle
firearm
charles
in
the
future
if
you
are
going
to
post
to
tpg
and
jump
into
a
previous
discussion
please
read
the
entire
posting
not
just
sentence
that
you
decide
to
respond
to
what
the
hell
are
you
saying
here
youre
wasting
time
and
space
trying
to
make
a
political
and
gun
control
issue
out
of
a
discussion
that
isnt
the
cphv
reports
that
youth
bring
guns
to
school
daily
and
that
bring
guns
to
school
at
least
once
a
year
i
wouldnt
trust
their
statistics
without
independent
verification
the
cdc
estimates
that
out
high
school
students
carried
a
gun
to
school
at
least
once
in
based
on
cphv
statistics
based
on
ucr
based
on
what
the
cdc
also
says
that
million
elementaryaged
latchkey
children
kids
who
come
home
from
school
to
an
empty
house
have
access
to
guns
in
their
home
therefore
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
claim
charles
buddy
im
getting
really
tired
of
this
do
you
live
on
the
planet
mars
as
a
physicist
i
realize
that
you
probably
dont
come
into
contact
with
many
youth
but
i
really
think
you
need
to
make
a
trip
to
your
local
urban
high
school
and
discover
the
joy
of
guns
in
schools
in
addition
spend
a
few
minutes
talking
to
these
kids
ask
them
if
they
have
ever
heard
gunshots
in
their
neighborhoods
whether
they
know
anyone
who
has
been
shot
whether
they
know
anyone
who
has
a
gun
whether
they
have
ever
held
a
gun
and
whether
they
themselves
have
ever
been
shot
believe
me
charles
that
will
be
your
independent
verification
