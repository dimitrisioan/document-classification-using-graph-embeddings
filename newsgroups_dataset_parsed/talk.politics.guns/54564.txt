Q
PUBLIC
WITH
A
GUN
PROTECTED
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
US
VS
MILLER
SUSTAINED
MILLERS
CONVICTION
OF
POSSESSION
OF
AN
ILLEGAL
FIREARM
NOTING
THAT
A
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUN
WAS
NOT
A
PROPER
MILITIA
WEAPON
NO
THEY
NOTED
THAT
NO
ONE
HAD
CLAIMED
THAT
IT
WAS
A
PROPER
MILITIA
WEAPON
DESPITE
HAVING
BEEN
USED
IN
AT
LEAST
TWO
WARS
THIS
WAS
TRUE
SINCE
NEITHER
MILLER
NOR
HIS
LAWYER
APPEARED
BEFORE
THE
COURT
DID
THEY
OR
DID
THEY
NOT
SUSTAIN
MILLERS
CONVICTION
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
TEXT
OF
THE
CASE
HANDY
MILLER
WAS
CONVICTED
OF
OWNING
A
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUN
AND
NOT
PAYING
THE
NFA
TAX
SNATCHES
OF
THE
COURTS
DECISION
THE
SECOND
AMENDMENT
WAS
INTENDED
TO
ASSURE
THE
CONTINUATION
AND
RENDER
POSSIBLE
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
SUCH
A
FORCE
THE
MILITIA
IT
MUST
BE
INTERPRETED
AND
APPLIED
WITH
THAT
END
IN
VIEW
THE
MILITIA
INCLUDES
ALL
MALES
PHYSICALLY
CAPABLE
OF
ACTING
IN
CONCERT
FOR
THE
COMMON
DEFENSE
HOWEVER
REGARDING
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUNS
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
NOT
WITHIN
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
THAT
THIS
WEAPON
IS
ANY
PART
OF
THE
ORDINARY
MILITARY
EQUIPMENT
OR
THAT
ITS
USE
COULD
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THE
COMMON
DEFENSE
JUDICIAL
NOTICE
IS
THE
TERM
OF
ART
HERE
IT
MEANT
THAT
NO
SUCH
EVIDENCE
HAD
BEEN
FORMALLY
PRESENTED
THIS
IS
DIFFERENT
FROM
CLAIMING
THAT
THEY
HAD
RULED
THAT
IT
WASNT
YES
SHOTGUNS
HAD
BEEN
USED
IN
WWI
THE
SPANISHAMERICAN
WAR
AND
THE
US
CIVIL
WAR
THAT
WAS
NOT
IN
QUESTION
THE
POSSESSION
OF
A
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUN
WAS
IE
A
WEAPON
ALTERED
TO
IMPROVE
CONCEALIBILITY
IM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
PLAIN
SHOTGUNS
IN
WAR
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
SHORT
BARRELLED
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUNS
IN
WAR
COMPARE
REVOLUTIONARY
WAR
BLUNDERBUSSES
LUPARAS
IN
THE
SPANISHAMERICAN
WAR
AND
TRENCHCLEANERS
IN
WW
I
THEY
WERE
ALSO
PUT
TO
GOOD
USE
BY
US
SOLDIERS
IN
WW
II
NOT
TO
MENTION
BEING
INVALUABLE
TO
TUNNEL
RATS
IN
VIETNAM
BUT
OF
COURSE
MILLER
TOOK
PLACE
IN
THEREFORE
US
VS
MILLER
SUPPORTS
LIMITED
GOVERNMENT
REGULATION
OF
FIREARMS
DONT
GO
ARGUING
DOWN
THIS
ROAD
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
WILLING
TO
ABIDE
BY
THE
CONSEQUENCES
THAT
YOU
FIND
AT
THE
END
OF
IT
MAINLY
THAT
THE
LAWABIDING
COMMON
MAN
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
OWN
ANY
WEAPON
THAT
HAS
A
MILITIA
PURPOSE
FROM
HANDGUNS
TO
SAWEDOFF
SHOTGUNS
AND
FULLY
AUTOMATIC
WEAPONS
THAT
IN
FACT
IS
WHAT
THIS
DECISION
SAYS
YOU
ARE
FREE
TO
PRODUCE
EVIDENCE
THAT
IM
NOT
WILLING
TO
ABIDE
WITH
ALL
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THIS
HERE
IS
MY
QUANDARY
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
ARGUING
THAT
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
GUNS
FALL
OUTSIDE
THE
SCOPE
OF
THE
SECOND
THIS
ISNT
A
USEFUL
ARGUMENT
UNLESS
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
SOME
SIGNIFICANT
GUN
OR
CLASS
OF
GUN
BELONGS
IN
THAT
CLASS
I
THINK
WE
BOTH
AGREE
THAT
ZIP
GUNS
PROBABLY
ARENT
PROTECTED
MAYBE
WE
ALSO
BOTH
AGREE
THAT
ALL
THE
WEAPONS
THAT
RANDOM
STATE
GOVERNMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
BANNING
OR
TRYING
TO
BAN
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
NO
SPORTING
PURPOSE
AND
NO
PROVATE
CITIZEN
WOULD
EVER
NEED
THESE
GUNS
DO
FALL
UNDER
THE
PROTECTION
OF
THE
SECOND
SO
GIVEN
THAT
DAMN
NEAR
ANY
GUN
OF
ANY
PRACTICAL
UTILITY
IS
OR
HAS
AT
SOME
TIME
BEEN
USED
BY
THE
MILITARY
EVEN
IF
ONLY
FOR
MARKSMANSHIP
TRAINING
PURPOSES
I
NEED
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
ARE
INTENT
ON
PRESSING
THIS
POINT
ARGUING
THAT
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
NOT
PROTECTED
BY
THE
SECOND
JUST
BECAUSE
I
DONT
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
ENDORSE
THE
NRA
POSITION
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
I
OPPOSE
THE

THIS
ATTITUDE
IS
WHAT

THE

UNPOPULAR
OFTEN
WHAT
