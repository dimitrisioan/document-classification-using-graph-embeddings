also
prevented

from
coming

watch
from

two
miles

whatever
really
happenned
must
be

enough
as
i

it
was
considered
unsafe
for
the
tv
networks
to
get
any
closer
surely
the
networks
can
judge
the
risks
of
reporting
for
themselves

havent
noticed
cnn
being
banned

ever
been
explained
or
are
we
to
assume
that
out
of
the
whole
of
the
city
an
offcourse
missile
just
happened
to
hit
that
hotel
at
a
probability
of

some
very
large

who
