IN

INDIAN

WALLS
ETC
IS
IT
THE
SWASTIKA
THAT
IS
BAD
JUST
WANT
TO
BACK
THIS
UP
WITH
A
PERSONAL
ANECDOTE
MY
GRANDPARENTS
HAVE
A
NAVAJO
RUG
MADE
IN
THE
WHICH
THEY
RECEIVED
IN
TRADE
FROM
THE
WEAVER
WHILE
LIVING
IN
FLAGSTAFF
ARIZONA
THE
DECORATIVE
MOTIF
CONSISTS
OF
LARGE
BLACK
SWASTIKAS
ONE
IN
EACH
CORNER
WHATS
MORE
THE
COLOR
SCHEME
IS
BLACK
WHITE
AND
RED
TO
THE
CASUAL
GLANCE
IT
WOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
NAZI
RELIC
OF
SOME
KIND
YET
THEY
OWNED
IT
TEN
YEARS
BEFORE
HITLER
AND
THE
NATIONAL
SOCIALISTS
CAME
TO
POWER
AS
I
RECALL
THEY
TOOK
IT
DOWN
IN
THE
AND
DIDNT
FEEL
QUITE
RIGHT
ABOUT
PUTTING
IT
BACK
UP
UNTIL
THE
IT
STILL
DRAWS
COMMENTS
FROM
THOSE
WHO
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
IS
HAVING
LIVED
PLAYED
AND
WORKED
ON
AND
NEAR
THE
NAVAJO
RESERVATION
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
I
CAN
CONFIRM
THIS
IS
AN
ANCIENT
PATTERN
FOUND
IN
PETROGLYPHS
DATED
TO
YEARS
OLD
ALSO
THE
INDIANS
NEVER
STOPPED
MAKING
RUGS
WITH
THIS
PATTERN
THEY
JUST
STOPPED
SELLING
THEM
AFTER
THE
NAZIS
PREEMPTED
THE
SWASTIKA
NOTE
ALSO
THAT
THE
INDIAN
VERSIONS
USE
BOTH
CLOCKWISE
AND
COUNTERCLOCKWISE
SWASTIKAS
OB
GUNS
ITS
THE
RARE
NAVAHO
FAMILY
THAT
DOESNT
OWN
A
RIFLE
THEY
REMEMBER
BEING
RELOCATED
BY
THE
US
ARMY
AND
DONT
INTEND
TO
DO
IT
AGAIN
THE
HOPI
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HAVE
A
DISLIKE
FOR
WEAPONS
FROM
MY
EXPERIENCE
PERHAPS
THEY
JUST
HIDE
THEM
BETTER
FROM
STRANGERS
KIRK
HAYS
NRA
LIFE
SEVENTH
GENERATION
THE
ONLY
THING
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
TRIUMPH
OF
EVIL
IS
FOR
GOOD
MEN
TO
DO
NOTHING
