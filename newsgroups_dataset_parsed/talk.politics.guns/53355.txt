CLEMENTS
WRITES
WASNT
SHE
THE
ONE
MAKING
THE
COMMENT
IN
ABOUT
GEORGE
BEING
BORN
WITH
A
SILVER
FOOT
IN
HIS
MOUTH
SOUNDS
LIKE
ANOTHER
DAMN
POLITICIAN
TO
ME
AINT
LIKE
THE
OLD
DAYS
IN
TEXAS
ANYMORE
THE
POLITICIANS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
CORRUPT
THEN
BUT
AT
LEAST
THEYD
TAKE
A
STAND
MY
APOLOGIES
TO
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONS
I
CAN
THINK
OF
NEWS
NOW
IS
THAT
THE
HOUSE
MAY
ALREADY
HAVE
A
TWOTHIRDS
MAJORITY
SO
HER
OPPOSITION
OUT
OF
HER
CONCERN
FOR
IMAGE
SHES
EVEN
SAID
THIS
PUBLICLY
MAY
NOT
MATTER
DO
PEOPLE
EXPECT
THE
TEXANS
CONGRESSMEN
TO
ACT
AS
THE
NJ
REPUBLICANS
DID
THERE
IS
A
LIKELY
VETO
PROOF
MAJORITY
IN
THE
HOUSE
THE
SENATE
UNFORTUNATELY
IS
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
THE
LTGOV
HAS
VOWED
THAT
THE
BILL
WILL
NOT
BE
VOTED
ON
AND
HE
HAS
THE
POWER
TO
DO
IT
IN
ADDITION
THE
SENATE
IS
A
MUCH
SMALLER
AND
MORE
READILY
MANIPULATED
BODY
ON
THER
OTHER
HAND
THE
SEMIAUTOMATIC
BAN
WILL
LIKELY
NOT
LIVE
AS
AT
LEAST
FIFTY
PER
CENT
OF
THE
HOUSE
CURRENTLY
OPPOSES
IT
AND
IT
IS
VERY
FAR
DOWN
IN
THE
BILL
ORDER
IN
THE
SENATE
I
BELIEVE
IT
WILL
BE
ADDRESSED
AFTER
THE
CCW
BILL
AND
I
THOUGHT
MY
TX
POLITICAL
SCIENCE
CLASS
WAS
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
DILLON

THE
OPINIONS
EXPRESSED
ARE
THOSE
OF
