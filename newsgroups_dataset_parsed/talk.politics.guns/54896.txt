yet
the
fbi
mouthpiece
at
this
afternoons
press
conference
characterized
the
quantity
of
cs
gas
pumped
into
the
building
as
massive
and
speculated
that
after
a
few
hours
of
exposure
any
davidian
gas
masks
would
become
useless
does
this
sound
not
harmful
to
you
hm
a
previous
poster
argued
that
the
fact
that
the
bds
did
not
rush
to
escape
the
burning
building
indicated
that
it
was
they
and
not
any
of
the
government
actions
that
started
the
fire
on
the
other
hand
i
wonder
if
with
a
face
full
of
massive
amounts
of
cs
i
would
be
able
to
escape
a
burning
tinderbox
like
that
ranch
house
assuming
my
best
efforts
imagine
you
have
been
under
seige
for
almost
two
months
by
an
enemy
which
you
believe
wants
to
kill
you
suddenly
they
pump
tear
gas
into
your
building
and
punch
holes
in
it
with
tanks
then
a
fire
breaks
out
do
you
run
outside
to
be
slaughtered
or
stay
and
face
your
fate
