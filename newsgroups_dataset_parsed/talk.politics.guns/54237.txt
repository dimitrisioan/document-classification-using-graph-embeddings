btw
which
parts
should
be
secure
criminal
records
ie
convictions
are
typically
considered
public
information
so
should
that
info
be
secure
remember
the
population
includes
parents
checking
prospective
childcare
worker
parents
checking
a
babysitter
shouldnt
need
access
to
the
information
stored
in
the
card
sure
they
do
the
prospective
sitter
may
have
a
nasty
habit
of
molesting
kids
three
or
four
months
into
the
job
the
references
may
not
have
known
him
long
enough
or
may
not
have
picked
up
on
this
yet
remember
criminal
conviction
info
is
public
so
if
youre
going
to
argue
for
an
id
card
other
people
are
going
to
have
a
strong
argument
that
it
disclose
public
info
as
perhaps
some
insight
into
how
this
sort
of
thing
works
the
local
college
newspaper
had
a
big
crusade
to
have
the
ut
police
release
crime
stats
the
school
claimed
that
to
do
so
would
violate
federal
education
records
privacy
laws
they
swore
up
and
down
they
werent
interested
in
student
discipline
records
only
for
stats
so
people
could
make
an
evaluation
of
how
safe
the
campus
was
it
was
barely
a
week
after
crime
stats
were
released
before
the
daily
beacon
had
an
editorial
calling
for
student
disciplinary
stats
to
be
released
because
they
complained
certain
segments
of
the
campus
population
were
treated
administratively
rather
than
turned
over
to
the
police
and
therefore
the
criminal
states
werent
accurate
what
people
say
they
want
public
today
may
not
be
what
they
say
tomorrow
