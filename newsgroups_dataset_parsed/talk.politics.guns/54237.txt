TO
HAVE
THE
UT
POLICE
RELEASE
CRIME

THE

CLAIMED
THAT
TO

SO
WOULD
VIOLATE
FEDERAL

RECORDS
PRIVACY
LAWS
THEY
SWORE
UP
AND
DOWN
THEY
WERENT
INTERESTED
IN
STUDENT
DISCIPLINE
RECORDS
ONLY
FOR

SO
PEOPLE
COULD
MAKE
AN
EVALUATION
OF
HOW
SAFE
THE

WAS
IT
WAS
BARELY
A
WEEK
AFTER
CRIME
STATS
WERE
RELEASED
BEFORE
THE
DAILY
BEACON
HAD
AN
EDITORIAL
CALLING
FOR
STUDENT
DISCIPLINARY
STATS
TO
BE
RELEASED
BECAUSE
THEY
COMPLAINED
CERTAIN
SEGMENTS
OF
THE
CAMPUS
POPULATION
WERE
TREATED
ADMINISTRATIVELY
RATHER
THAN
TURNED
OVER
TO
THE
POLICE
AND
THEREFORE
THE
CRIMINAL
STATES
WERENT
ACCURATE
WHAT
PEOPLE
SAY
THEY
WANT
PUBLIC
TODAY
MAY
NOT
BE
WHAT
THEY
SAY
TOMORROW
