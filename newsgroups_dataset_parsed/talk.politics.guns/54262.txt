re
my
gun
is
like
my
american
express
card
in
article
andysailstanfordedu
andy
freeman
says
in
article
jason
kratz
all
your
points
are
very
well
taken
and
things
that
i
havent
considered
as
i
am
not
really
familiar
enough
with
handguns
thats
not
all
that
kratz
doesnt
know
hell
a
glock
is
the
last
thing
that
should
be
switched
to
the
only
thing
that
i
know
about
a
glock
is
the
lack
of
a
real
safety
on
it
sure
there
is
that
little
thing
in
the
trigger
but
that
isnt
too
great
of
a
safety
now
we
know
that
kratz
doesnt
understand
what
a
safety
is
supposed
to
do
he
also
confuses
things
he
can
see
with
things
that
exist
glocks
have
multiple
safeties
even
though
only
one
is
visible
from
the
outside
excuse
me
but
i
do
know
what
i
safety
is
supposed
to
do
its
basic
purpose
not
to
let
the
gun
fire
until
youre
ready
christ
ive
known
that
since
i
had
my
first
crosman
air
gun
you
dont
know
me
so
dont
make
assumptions
about
what
i
know
and
dont
know
i
do
know
that
the
glock
has
multiple
safties
from
reports
looking
at
them
at
a
gun
shop
and
friends
who
own
one
a
safety
is
supposed
to
keep
the
gun
from
going
off
unless
thats
what
the
user
wants
with
glocks
one
says
i
want
the
gun
to
go
off
by
pulling
the
trigger
if
the
safeties
it
has
make
that
work
it
has
a
real
safety
no
matter
what
kratz
thinks
andy
from
the
things
i
have
readheard
glocks
are
always
knocked
because
of
the
trigger
safety
they
are
supposedly
harder
to
learn
to
use
properly
every
article
that
i
have
read
cant
be
wrong
about
the
damn
thing
and
dont
ask
me
to
quote
my
sources
because
i
dont
keep
a
ton
of
gun
magazines
andor
recguns
articles
laying
around
boy
you
cant
make
a
simple
statement
on
here
without
someone
getting
right
on
your
ass
no
wonder
why
there
are
so
many
problems
in
the
world
everyone
takes
everything
just
a
little
too
seriously
by
the
way
im
not
going
to
reply
to
any
of
this
stuff
anymore
as
someone
made
the
good
point
that
this
discussion
is
getting
too
close
to
rg
and
yes
i
know
that
i
had
something
to
do
with
that
