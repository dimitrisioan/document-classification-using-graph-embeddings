A

A

PROBLEMS

SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
EXTRA
CONNECTOR
SOCKET
ON
THE
BACK
THAT
I
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
IT
IS
FOR
THE
ADDRESS
IS
SET
BY
SOME
JUMPERS
ON
THE
BOTTOM
SO
I
DONT

WOULD
BE
NICE
TO

GOT
THE

TOOK
A
WHILE

THE
FORMATING
INITIALY
WAS
TROUBLESOME
BUT
SEEMS
TO
BE
OK
THE
MAIN
PROBLEM
IS

A
RESET

MACPLUS
THE
DRIVE
DISAPPEARS
IF
I
SHUT
THE
MAC
