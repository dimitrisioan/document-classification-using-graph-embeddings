quantum
hard
disk
i
recently
aquired
a
quantum
harddisk
it
is
a
meg
mechanism
it
is
scsi
i
have
a
few
questions
and
a
few
problems
first
there
seems
to
be
an
extra
connector
socket
on
the
back
that
i
cant
figure
out
what
it
is
for
the
address
is
set
by
some
jumpers
on
the
bottom
so
i
dont
think
it
is
for
that
any
ideas
second
it
would
be
nice
to
get
a
hardware
manual
for
the
drive
there
are
a
lot
of
jumpers
on
it
that
we
dont
know
what
they
are
for
third
i
have
got
the
drive
to
format
it
took
a
while
to
get
things
to
work
and
most
of
it
is
fine
for
now
the
formating
initialy
was
troublesome
but
seems
to
be
ok
the
main
problem
is
if
you
do
a
reset
on
the
macplus
the
drive
disappears
if
i
shut
the
mac
off
and
then
back
on
agian
then
the
drive
comes
up
fine
any
ideas
please
reply

the
email
addresses
