I
HAVE
A
LOGITECH
HAND
SCANNER
FROM
A
PC
IM
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
HAS
BEEN
SUCCESSFUL
IN
CONNECTING
THE
SCANNER
TO
A
MAC
IT
HAS
THE
SAME
CONNECTOR
AND
IS
A
SERIAL
DEVICE
ON
THE
PC
I
CAN
IMAGINE
THE
PINS
CONIGURATION
WOULD
NEED
TO
CHANGEED
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THE
SIGNAL
LEVELS
WOULD
BE
CORRECT
AND
IF
THE
MAC
SW
WOULD
WORK
WITH
IT
OF
COURSE
THE
MANUALS
SAY
NOTHING
ABOUT
THE
INTERFACE
CONNECTOR
LAYOUT
OR
ANYTHING
HWISH
ANY
IDEAS
THANX
STEVE
