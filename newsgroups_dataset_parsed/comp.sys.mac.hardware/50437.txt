THE
SONY
HAS
BETTER
VIDEO
CIRCUITRY
THAN
EITHER
OF
THE
OTHER
TWO
MONITORS
IT
CAN
DISPLAY
APPLE
VGA
VGA
THOUGH
THIS
HAS
HZ
FLICKER
AND
APPLE
HZ
REFRESH
NO
FLICKER
AT
ALL
IT
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
DISPLAY
APPLES
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
AND
THE
PIXELS
WOULD
BE
REAL
SMALL
ANYWAY
SO
IT
MIGHT
NOT
BE
THAT
USEFUL
NOTE
THAT
WITH
EITHER
SONY
MONITOR
YOU
WILL
NEED
THE
PROPER
ADAPTER
WHICH
BOTH
CONNECTS
THE
VIDEO
SIGNALS
PROPERLY
BUT
ALSO
INFORMS
THE
MACINTOSH
VIDEO
HARDWARE
OF
WHICH
DISPLAY
MODE

IM
ASSUMING
THAT
THE

CONNECTED
NOW
I
THINK
IVE
SEEN
ADS
IN
POPULAR
MAC
MAGAZINES
FOR
PRODUCTS
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
ITS
JUST
A
MONITOR
JUST
A
VIDEO
CARD
OR
A
PACKAGE
OF
BOTH
THAT
ALLOW
YOU
TO
CHANGE
RESOLUTIONS
ON
THE
FLY
WO
RESTARTING
THE
MAC
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
BUY
A
WOULD
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
SWITCH
BACK
AND
FORTH
BETWEEN
APPLE
AND
APPLE
WITHOUT
RESTARTING
THE
MAC
IS
THIS
STRICTLY
A
HARDWARE
STARTUP
FUNCTION
OR
CAN
SOFTWARE
INTERVENE
OR
DOES
THE
MAC
HARDWARE
OCCASIONALLY
PROBE
THE
CABLE
SETTING
AND
SWITCH
AUTOMATICALLY
