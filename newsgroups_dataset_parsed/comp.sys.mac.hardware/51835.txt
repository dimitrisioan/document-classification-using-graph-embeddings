hi
a
while
back
there
was
a
thread
in
this
group
about
the
use
of
the
iwii
in
europe
in
countries
with
hz
ac
current
the
consensus
at
the
time
was
that
the
iwii
would
not
work
there
as
i
will
be
moving
there
this
summer
i
called
apple
to
make
sure
and
they
told
me
today
that
the
iwii
as
bought
in
the
us
will
definitely
run
on
hz
ac
current
as
long
as
a
stepdown
converter
is
employed
if
v
current
is
used
the
same
info
turns
out
can
be
found
in
the
iwii
manual
p
in
the
version
but
i
didnt
really
trust
that
does
anyone
have
any
direct
experience
to
the
contrary
just
wondering
