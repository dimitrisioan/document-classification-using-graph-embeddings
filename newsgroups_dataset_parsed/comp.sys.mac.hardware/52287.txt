the
us
environmental
protection
agency
has
formed
an
alliance
with
computer
manufacturers
to
promote
the
introduction
of
energy
efficient
pcs
that
power
down
automatically
when
not
being
used
this
is
a
bad
idea
my
machine
is
on
hours
a
day
but
its
actually
doing
things
hours
a
day
i
use
it
as
an
all
purpose
alarm
clock
scheduler
ive
got
routines
that
run
in
the
middle
of
the
night
phone
calls
it
makes
during
the
day
when
im
out
if
your
machine
is
on
hours
a
day
then
you
can
count
on
it
to
be
working
hours
a
day
i
could
call
it
from
work
and
download
a
file
that
i
might
need
i
could
call
it
from
work
and
have
it
turn
the
lights
on
if
im
going
to
be
late
oops
more
wasted
electricity
but
conversely
i
could
have
it
turn
the
lights
off
heck
i
suppose
i
could
even
connect
the
microwave
and
have
dinner
ready
when
i
get
there
oh
well
nevermind
im
just
babbling
