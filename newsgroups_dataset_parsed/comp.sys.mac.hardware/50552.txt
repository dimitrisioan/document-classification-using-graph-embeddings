racet
optical
ive
got
a
racet
mo
drive
with
a
ricoh
mechanism
with
the
new
roms
the
thing
is
i
have
a
new
tosoh
optical
disk
per
sector
cart
for
the
thing
that
refuses
to
mount
or
be
formatted
all
the
carts
that
i
have
for
the
drive
that
work
are
racet
certified
media
carts
all
i
can
think
of
is
that
this
tosoh
cart
uses
some
kind
of
incompatible
low
level
format
anyone
know
what
software
will
allow
this
to
be
formatted
on
this
drive
or
a
new
dip
setting
for
the
mechanism
ive
tried
just
about
every
combination
of
drivers
and
custom
formatting
programs
i
can
find
with
no
luck
any
ideas
