is
there
a
fix
for
this
we
have
a
quadra
that
will
not
finish
startup
unless
there
is
a
monitor
connected
this
would
be
no
problem
but
since
were
running
it
as
a
file
server
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
monitor
connected
all
the
time
ive
seen
a
control
panel
made
for
this
i
dont
remember
the
name
where
i
saw
it
or
on
what
quadra
models
it
will
work
but
i
do
know
it
exists
