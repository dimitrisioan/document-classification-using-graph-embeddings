why
would
apple
release
a
duo
dock
with
a
processor
of
its
own
heres
why
people
have
hounded
apple
for
a
notebook
with
a
processor
in
it
apple
cant
deliver
that
right
now
because
the
saps
too
much
power
radiates
far
too
much
heat
and
is
too
large
for
a
notebook
how
does
one
get
around
that
without
designing
a
new
chipset
use
existing
powerbook
technology
to
your
best
advantage
the
duo
dock
gives
apple
a
unique
ability
to
give
users
that
power
in
a
semiportable
fashion
by
plunking
the
into
the
dock
youve
got
quadra
power
at
your
desk
on
the
road
that
should
be
able
to
handle
most
of
your
needs
okay
not
the
best
solution
but
its
an
answer
to
a
nowin
situation
so
does
this
mean
one
will
be
able
to
use
the
powerbooks
processor
in
parallel
to
the
docks
processor
okay
were
getting
really
hypothetical
now
it
would
also
be
great
for
another
reason
when
not
docked
it
could
serve
as
an
ara
server
to
the
large
internal
hd
your
corporate
email
etc
in
a
pinch
you
would
also
have
two
machines
instead
of
if
they
could
couple
that
thought
with
rocketshare
and
let
you
use
both
the
on
the
pb
and
the
on
the
dock
it
would
be
a
mighty
powerful
dock
