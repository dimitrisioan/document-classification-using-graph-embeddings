re
screen
death
mac
i
have
a
very
old
mac
and
a
mac
plus
both
of
which
have
the
same
problem
their
screens
blank
out
sometimes
after
a
minor
physical
jolt
such
as
inserting
a
floppy
in
the
internal
drive
sometimes
all
by
themselves
computer
left
to
itself
just
goes
blank
i
have
replaced
the
wires
connecting
the
logic
boards
and
the
video
board
because
it
seemed
at
first
that
jiggling
the
wires
made
the
screen
come
back
on
this
worked
for
a
while
but
the
blanking
out
has
returned
can
i
do
anything
do
i
need
a
new
power
supply
a
new
crt
a
new
computer
i
had
the
same
problem
with
my
a
long
time
ago
resoldering
the
joints
on
the
motherboard
all
of
them
fixed
it
turns
out
that
continuous
heating
and
cooling
caused
annular
ringshaped
cracks
to
develop
in
the
solder
effectively
cutting
the
video
circuitry
off
if
youre
not
a
solderjockey
you
might
want
to
have
someone
else
do
it
i
took
mine
to
an
electrical
engineer
buddy
but
it
was
a
job
