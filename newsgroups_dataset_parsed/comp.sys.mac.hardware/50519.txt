GOOD
OR
BAD
HI
IM
LOOKING
INTO
BUYING

TWO
SERIAL
PORTS

A
MODEM
A
PRINTER
MIDI
AND
A
SOUND
DIGITIZER
UNFORTUNATELY
SPECIFICALLY
IM
LOOKING
AT
THE
AXION
ELECTRONIC
SWITCHER
BECAUSE
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
FAIRLY
CHEAP
ABOUT
AT
MACZONE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
IVE
HEARD
THAT
WITH
MOST
OF
THESE
THINGS
YOU
CAN
STILL
ONLY
USE
SERIAL
PORTS
AT
A
TIME
IT
JUST
PREVENTS
YOU
FROM
PHYSICALLY
SWAPPING
CABLES
ALTHOUGH
IVE
ALSO
HEARD
THAT
PROGRAMS
THAT
USE
THE
COMM
TOOLBOX
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
AS
MANY
SERIAL
PORTS
AS
THEY
WANT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
WITH
THE
AXION
SWITCHBOX
FINALLY
IF
THE
AXION
STINKS
OR
IF
YOURE
USING
SOMETHING
ELSE
THAT
YOU
THINK
IS
GOOD

INTERESTED

HEARING
ABOUT
OTHER

WOULD
LIKE
TO
SPEND
