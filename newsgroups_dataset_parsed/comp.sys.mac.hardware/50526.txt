CANNOT
MOVE
DATA
FAST
ENOUGH
I
WANT
TO
ACHIEVE
AN
OVERALL
THROUGHPUT
RATE
OF
AROUND
MEGABYTES
SEC
FOR
VERY
LARGE
DATA
TRANSFERS
AROUND
MB
I
HAVE
A
QUADRA
I
HAVE
A
NUBUS
NETWORK
CARD
THAT
CAN
PUMP
DATA
IN
TO
MAC
MEMORY
AT
MBS
USING
BLOCKMODE
TRANSFERS
I
HAVE
A
HIGHSPEED
DISK
ARRAY
NO
ASYNCHRONOUS
PB
CALLS
THAT
CAN
ACHIEVE
MBS
LETS
SAY
ALL
TRANSFERS
GO
FROM
DISK
TO
BUFFER
TO
NETWORK
CARD
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
FIRST
TRANSFER
ALL
THE
DATA
FROM
THE
DISK
TO
BUFFER
THEN
TRANSFER
ALL
THE
DATA
FROM
THE
BUFFER
TO
CARD
MBS
THEN
MBS
RESULT
IN
AN
OVERALL
MBS
TOO
SLOW
SO
I
TRIED
THE
FOLLOWING
SCHEME
FOR
AN
NMEGABYTE
TRANSFER
STEP
LOAD
THE
MB
FROM
DISK
TO
BUFFER
STEP
ASYNCH
SEND
MB
OUT
CARD
LOAD
THE
MB
FROM
DISK
TO
BUFFER
STEP
ASYNCH
SEND
MB
OUT
CARD
LOAD
THE
MB
FROM
DISK
TO
BUFFER
STEP
N
ASYNCH
SEND
THE
MB
OUT
CARD
LOAD
THE
NTH
MB
FROM
DISK
TO
BUFFER
STEP
SEND
THE
NTH
MB
OUT
CARD
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
CODE
APPARENTLY
DOES
EXECUTE
THE
CARD
TRANSFER
ASYNCHRONOUSLY
AND
THE
CARD
DOES
NOT
USE
THE
MAC
CPU
AT
ALL
IT
IS
USING
THE
BUFFER
THO
EACH
OF
THE
STEPS
THROUGH
N
TAKE
AS
LONG
AS
IF
THE
TWO
TRANSFERS
WERE
EXECUTED
ONE
AFTER
ANOTHER
SO
THERE
IS
NO
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THE
RATE
WHY
IS
THE
MAC
RAM
DUALPORT
SO
THE
NUBUS
CARD
AND
THE
DISK
DRIVER
CAN
BOTH
ACCESS
DATA
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
IS
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
THE
TWO
DEVICES
CARD
AND
DISK
DRIVER
BOTH
HAVE
TO
USE
THE
SAME
BUS
TO
MAC
RAM
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
I
CAN
DO
