APPLE
MONITOR
WOES
I
HAVE
A
MONTH
OLD
THAT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
ACQUIRED
THE
JITTERS
OF
LATE
THE
APPLE
COLOR
MONITOR
THAT
IM
USING
WITH
AN
LCIII
SORT
OF
JIGGLES
TO
THE
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
ALL
THE
TIME
NOW
I
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
RELOCATE
THE
MONITOR
TO
MAKE
SURE
THE
PROBLEM
ISNT
INTERFERENCE
FROM
SOMETHING
ELSE
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
SEEMS
TO
REMAIN
NO
MATTER
WHAT
I
DO
HAS
ANYBODY
ENCOUNTERED
THIS
PROBLEM
