SYQUEST

ANTHONY
S
KIM
WRITES
I
REMEMBER
SOMEONE
MENTION
ABOUT
A
SYQUEST
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
HEARD
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THIS
ID
BE
INTERESTED
IN
THE
COST
PER
MEGABYTE
AND
THE
APPROXIMATE
COST
OF
THE
DRIVE
ITSELF
AND
HOW
THEY
COMPARE
TO
THE
BERNOULLI
I
THINK
YOU
MUST
BE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
SYQUEST
CODE
NAMED
MESA
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
A
WINCHESTER
TECHNOLOGY
DRIVE
PRETTY
MUCH
LIKE
THE
OTHER
SYQUEST
DRIVES
IN
TERMS
OF
HOW
IT
WORKS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LATEST
MACLEAK
THE
DRIVE
HAS
A
MS
ACCESS
TIME
MBS
SUSTAINED
THROUGHPUT
THESE
FIGURES
ARE
FROM
MEMORY
SO
THEY
COULD
BE
SLIGHTLY
OFF
BUT
THEY
GIVE
YOU
AN
IDEA
OF
PERFORMANCE
NONETHELESS
THE
DRIVE
WAS
ORIGINALLY
RELEASED
FOR
THE
PC
AND
JUST
RECENTLY
WAS
RELEASED
FOR
THE
MAC
WORLD
DONT
ASK
ME
WHAT
THE
DIFFERENCES
ARE
AND
THROUGH
THEY
ARE
CURRENTLY
IN
LIMITED
SUPPLY
ACCORDING
TO
A
SYQUEST
REP
THEY
ARE
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
RAMPING
UP
FOR
MASS
PRODUCTION
I
HAVE
ALREADY
SEEN
THEM
ADVERTISED
BY
A
NUMBER
OF
MANUFACTURERS
IN
MACLEAK
INCLUDING
PLI
MASSMICRO
CLUBMAC
AND
MACWAREHOUSES
POWERUSER
THE
PLI
AND
MASSMICRO
UNITS
ARE
PRICED
AT
JUST
AROUND
THE
LESSER
NAME
BRANDS
ARE
GOING
FOR
AROUND
FOR
AN
EXTERNAL
DRIVE
CARTRIDGES
WHICH
HOLD
MB
SELL
FOR
ABOUT
EACH
AT
THESE
PRICES
THE
DRIVES
AND
CARTRIDGES
ARE
CHEAPER
AND
BETTER
PERFORMING
THAN
THE
DRIVES
COST
PER
MEGABYTE
COMPARES
FAVORABLY
WITH
OTHER
CARTRIDGE
DRIVES
AND
BERNOULLI
DRIVES
BUT
FOR
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
DATA
OPTICAL
IS
STILL
CHEAPER
AND
MORE
RELIABLE
PERSONALLY
IM
EXCITED
BY
THE
NEW
DRIVE
AND
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
GETTING
MY
HANDS
ON
ONE
CHRIS
WAND
EGOTISM
IS
THE
ANESTHETIC
THAT
DULLS
THE
PAIN
OF
STUPIDITY
