floptical
kills
superdrive
i
recently
bought
a
pli
floptical
drive
and
i
was
very
happy
with
it
until
i
tried
to
use
it
to
format
a
hd
diskette
i
put
the
hd
floppy
in
my
superdrive
to
check
that
the
floptical
had
formatted
it
correctly
and
now
my
superdrive
refuses
to
recognize
any
floppy
it
says
this
disk
is
unreadable
and
asks
if
i
want
to
format
it
even
original
systems
floppies
from
apple
nor
will
it
format
the
disks
if
i
try
to
initialization
failed
strangely
enough
the
floptical
still
reads
both
the
mb
and
hd
disks
but
i
cant
look
at
my
floppies
and
if
i
have
a
crash
im
screwed
because
the
floptical
cant
be
used
as
a
startup
disk
pli
has
been
unresponsive
any
ideas
has
this
happened
to
anyone
before
i
was
looking
for
an
inexpensive
storage
solution
and
now
i
am
looking
at
an
expensive
repair
