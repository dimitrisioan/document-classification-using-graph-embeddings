when
the
computer
is
set
for
colors
and
certain
operations
are
done
particularly
vertical
scrolling
through
a
window
horizontal
white
lines
appear
on
the
monitor
which
generally
but
not
always
spare
open
windows
these
lines
accummulate
as
the
operation
is
continued
if
a
window
is
moved
over
the
involved
area
of
the
screen
and
then
moved
away
the
line
disappear
from
that
area
of
the
screen
this
problem
is
not
observed
if
the
monitor
is
configured
for
colors
or
a
inch
apple
monitor
with
colors
is
used
has
anyone
not
had
these
problems
in
the
given
configurations
that
would
help
eliminate
design
flaw
as
the
explanation
as
a
data
point
im
using
a
centris
with
the
apple
monitor
and
do
not
have
these
problems
i
can
produce
similar
artifacts
i
am
using
a
centris
with
an
apple
monitor
i
got
the
configuration
so
there
is
onboard
ethernet
and
megabyte
of
video
ram
the
effect
only
occurs
in
color
and
grey
modes
any
vertical
scrolling
operation
whether
with
a
scrollbar
or
say
using
vi
and
inserting
lines
will
produce
a
scattering
of
horizontal
flickering
lines
on
the
screen
they
do
not
persist
each
is
visible
for
perhaps
one
refresh
and
then
that
part
of
the
screen
is
back
as
usual
they
seem
to
always
start
at
or
about
the
pixel
from
the
left
and
are
maybe
pixels
wide
this
is
certainly
not
preventing
me
from
using
my
macintosh
but
it
does
seem
to
be
a
sign
of
something
perhaps
grounded
incorrectly
in
the
video
circuitry
i
went
ahead
and
called
the
apple
customer
assistance
center
at
or
more
direct
the
person
who
answered
was
polite
i
also
took
the
chance
to
complain
about
my
mouse
button
sticking
and
about
the
mac
hanging
on
boot
after
a
hard
killed
macsbug
crash
which
left
a
cd
in
the
drive
i
had
to
play
with
a
paperclip
for
about
minutes
to
get
thing
to
eject
after
which
the
mac
booted
