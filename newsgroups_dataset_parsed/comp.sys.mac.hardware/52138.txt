WRITES
I
JUST
PUT
A
CPU
INTO
MY
CENTRIS
NOW
I
HAVE
A
MATH
COPROCESSOR
BUT
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
SPEED
UP
THE
CENTRIS
TO
RUN
AT
EITHER
OR
NOT
WITHOUT
REPLACING
MOST
OF
THE
CHIPS
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
THE
ISNT
LIKE
THE
IISI
WAS
MEANING
THAT
THE
MOTHERBOARD
OF
THE
IS
ACTUALLY
DESIGNEDS
TO
RUN
AT
THE
SPEED
OF
THE
CPU
AND
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
RUN
AT
A
HIGHER
SPEED
LIKE
BUT
BE
FORCED
TO
RUN
AT
THE
SPEED
OF
A
SLOWER
CPU
I
DIDNT
SEE
ANY
OSCILLATORS
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
LIKE
THE
ONES
ON
THE
IISIS
MOTHERBOARD
WHERE
IS
THE
OSCILLATOR
FOR
THE
CENTRIS
THERE
IS
MORE
THAN
ONE
OSCILLATOR
IF
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
CPU
OSCILLATOR
CHIP
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
LOCATED
UNDER
THE
SOCKET
FOR
THE
AT
LEAST
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
HAVE
READ
IN
SOME
OTHER
POSTS
