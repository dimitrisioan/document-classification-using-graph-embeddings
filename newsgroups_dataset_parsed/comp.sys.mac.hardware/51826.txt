dear
macfriends
ive
seen
the
following
problem
om
three
mac
iisi
machines
all
with
mb
ram
installed
or
ns
simms
if
the
contents
of
a
window
are
being
calculated
and
updated
a
lot
of
strange
horizontal
lines
are
temporarily
generated
on
the
screen
the
lines
translate
to
the
top
of
the
screen
and
have
a
slightly
lower
brightness
than
their
surroundings
they
are
a
few
millimeters
apart
i
admit
that
they
are
vague
but
they
can
still
be
distinguished
clearly
especially
if
the
environment
ie
the
rest
of
the
room
is
a
bit
dark
applications
which
produce
this
effect
are
the
previewer
of
directtex
ie
dvireader
kaleidagraph
the
machines
use
their
builtin
video
and
drive
the
old
apple
hires
monochrome
screen
two
monitorscable
sets
tried
the
effect
is
independent
of
the
settings
in
the
following
control
panels
memory
adressing
mode
disk
cache
and
monitors
nr
of
greyscolors
have
you
ever
seen
this
effect
too
