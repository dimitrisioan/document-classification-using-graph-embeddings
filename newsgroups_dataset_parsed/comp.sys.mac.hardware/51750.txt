I
JUST
GOT
A
DUO
AND
IM
HAVING
SOME
DIFFICULTIES
IF
THE
MACHINE
IS
PLUGGED
IN
TO
THE
WALL
ADAPTER
PUT
TO
SLEEP
UNPLUGGED
FROM
THE
WALL
AND
WOKEN
UP
IT
CRASHES
OF
THE
TIME
THERES
NOTHING
BUT
THE
ORIGINAL
SYSTEM
SOFTWARE
ON
THE
MACHINE
THE
BATTERY
HAS
PLENTY
OF
LIFE
I
THINK
THIS
MUST
BE
A
POWER
MANAGER
PROBLEM
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
ABOUT
IT
ALSO
THE
SPEAKER
OCCASIONALLY
MAKES
A
HIGHPITCHED
HISS
THE
NOISE
IS
IRREGULAR
BUT
SEEMS
TO
FAVOR
SLEEP
AND
RESTART
COMMANDS
IVE
HAD
MY
DUO
FOR
A
FEW
WEEKS
NOW
AND
SUFFER
FROM
BOTH
OF
THE
ABOVE
PROBLEMS
I
REINSTALLED
MY
SYSTEM
SOFTWARE
TWICE
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
COMBAT
THE
PROBLEMS
THINKING
THEY
WERE
SYSTEM
SOFTWARE
PROBLEMS
INITIALLY
REINSTALLING
THE
SYSTEM
SEEMED
TO
HELP
BUT
NOT
ANYMORE
OCCASIONALLY
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
WAKE
UP
THE
DUO
I
GET
A
SOLID
SCREEN
OF
HORIZONTAL
LINES
ON
THE
SCREEN
IT
FREEZES
I
ALSO
GET
THE
HIGHPITCHED
HISS
OCCASIONALLY
BUT
ONLY
AT
STARTUP
IVE
CALLED
THE
APPLE
HOTLINE
SOSAPPL
THREE
TIMES
ALREADY
AND
FINALLY
THEY
AGREED
SOMETHING
IS
ASTRAY
AFTER
MY
DUOS
SCREEN
WOULD
GO
DIM
AND
THE
HARD
DRIVE
SPUN
DOWN
BY
ITSELFT
AND
PUT
ITSELF
TO
SLEEP
THIS
PROBLEM
ONLY
OCCURED
TWICE
APPLE
SENT
ME
A
BOX
TO

BE
LOOKED
AT
IN
NEW

FOR
A
WHILE
AT

APPLES
ADVICE
BUT
SINCE
THE

NOT
HAVE
AN
