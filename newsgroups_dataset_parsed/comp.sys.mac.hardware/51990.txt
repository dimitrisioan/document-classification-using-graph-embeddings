HEY

GOOD
BAD
POINTS
WE
BOUGHT
ONE
FROM
RELAX
TECHNOLOGIES
BIG
MISTAKE
THE
DRIVE
HAD
SOME
JUMPERS
SET
INCORRECTLY
SO
IT
DIDNT
WORK
AT
FIRST
AND
THE
SOFTWARE
THEY
SHIPPED
WITH
IT
WAS
INCOMPATABLE
WITH
THE
DRIVE
IT
WAS
THE
NEW
COMPRESSION
MODEL
AND
WORST
OF
ALL
WHEN
I
OPENED
THE
DRIVE
UP
TO
FIDDLE
WITH
THE
JUMPERS
I
FOUND
THE
INSIDE
OF
THE
CASE
COVERED
WITH
METAL
FILINGS
SORRY
TO
SHOUT
APPARENTLY
WHEN
THEY
DRILLED
THE
MOUNTING
HOLES
IN
THE
CASE
THEY
FORGOT
TO
CLEAN
IT
BEFORE
PUTTING
THE
DRIVE
IN
THIS
WAS
A
HP
DRIVE
BY
THE
WAY
AND
IS
NOW
WORKING
FINE
KNOCK
ON
WOOD
NO
THANKS
TO
RELAX
TECHNOLOGIES
HEY
YOUR
MILEAGE
MAY
VARY
BUT
LET
ME
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
NOT
BUY
FROM
RELAX
TECHNOLOGIES
EVEN
THOUGH
THEIR
PRICES
ARE
USUALLY
ABOUT
THE
LOWEST
DAVE
