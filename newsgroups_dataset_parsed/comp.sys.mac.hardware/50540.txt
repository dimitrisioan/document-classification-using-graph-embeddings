this
is
not
an
april
joke
a
dealer
in
my
town
told
me
that
the
powerbook
dont
sell
as
they
use
to
sell
the
guy
told
me
that
apple
is
having
the
same
problem
it
has
when
the
desktop
mac
was
too
expensive
the
powerbook
are
too
expensive
in
comparison
to
what
you
can
get
on
the
dos
side
what
do
you
think
of
this
do
you
feel
the
same
thing
about
it
just
curious
sounds
about
right
if
there
is
high
demand
for
a
product
there
is
little
incentive
to
aggresively
cut
prices
once
the
demand
fall
off
a
bit
then
is
the
time
to
start
getting
aggressive
with
pricing
waiting
too
long
can
really
hurt
your
business
though
the
powerbooks
have
sold
very
well
up
to
now
if
they
are
slowing
down
apple
needs
to
come
out
with
some
lower
priced
versions
the
only
reason
i
own
a
powerbook
is
that
i
could
spring
for
a
the
rest
of
the
lineup
is
way
to
pricey
for
me
id
bet
theyll
be
coming
out
with
more
power
versions
too
