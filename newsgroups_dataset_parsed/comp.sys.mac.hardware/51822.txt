why
does
apple
give
us
a
confusing
message

does
anyone
know
why
apple
has
an
ambiguous
message
for
regarding
fpu
in
all
mac
price
lists
ive
seen
every
has
the
message
fpu
optional
i
know
from
what
weve
discussed
in
this
newsgroup
that
all
have
the
fpu
built
in
except
the
configuration
why
would
they
be
so
unclear
about
this
issue
in
their
price
list
i
think
this
is
mostly
the
fault
of
the
people
who
write
up
the
literature
and
price
lists
being
confused
themselves
since
there
are
two
possible
processor
configurations
and
one
of
the
them
doesnt
have
an
fpu
it
does
seem
to
be
an
option
even
though
it
really
isnt
im
planning
to
buy
the
pretty
soon
but
im
now
getting
confused
with
whether
it
comes
with
fpu
or
not
well
then
allow
me
to
end
your
confusion
the
only
come
with
an
in
the
base
configuration
if
you
are
not
getting
this
configuration
then
you
are
getting
an
fpu
why
say
optional
if
its
built
in
good
question
i
have
been
wondering
that
since
feb
if
you
get
the
centris
with
cd
configuration
you
are
getting
a
mac
with
a
processor
that
has
builtin
math
coprocessor
support
my
understanding
is
that
the
optional
fpu
refers
to
your
option
of
purchasing
the
centris
without
fpu
or
one
of
the
other
configurations
with
fpu
this
is
possible
but
an
option
is
something
that
you
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
request
when
you
want
it
what
apple
has
done
is
given
the
buyer
a
choice
between
configurations
and
not
an
option
apple
does
not
offer
an
upgrade
from
the
nonfpu
system
to
become
an
fpu
system
and
it
is
unclear
whether
the
processor
on
the
nonfpu
system
a
can
be
replaced
with
a
supplied
by
another
vendor
this
is
not
unclear
at
all
in
fact
apple
has
included
in
the
roms
of
those
machines
with
code
to
recognize
the
presence
of
the
full
fpu
and
use
it
thereby
making
the
upgrade
as
easy
as
switching
chips
you
pop
the
out
and
pop
in
a
full
apple
did
send
a
memo
out
at
one
point
sating
that
the
centris
which
only
comes
with
a
nonfpu
processor
cannot
be
upgraded
to
support
an
fpu
the
pin
configurations
of
the
two
chips
apparently
do
not
match
so
you
cannot
swap
one
for
another
again
according
to
apples
memo
they
did
i
think
i
would
doublecheck
this
it
has
been
stated
countless
times
in
this
newsgroup
by
two
of
the
centris
hardware
designers
that
the
and
the
full
are
pin
compatible
and
that
the
can
be
upgraded
to
a
full
hades
