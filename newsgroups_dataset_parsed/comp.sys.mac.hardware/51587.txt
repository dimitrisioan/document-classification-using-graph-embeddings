I
JUST
RECENTLY
BOUGHT
A
MB
RAM
CARD
FOR
MY
ORIGINAL
MAC
PORTABLE
BACKLIT
AND
HAVE
SINCE
HAD
SOME
BIZARRE
CRASHES
IT
HAPPENS
WHEN
I
PUT
THE
MACHINE
TO
SLEEP
AND
WAKE
THE
MACHINE
UP
SOMETIMES
IT
WILL
JUST
FREEZE
THE
CURSOR
AND
LOCK
THE
MACHINE
UP
FORCING
ME
TO
PUSH
THE
RESET
SWITCH
OTHER
TIMES
IT
WILL
GIVE
ME
THE
USUAL
BOMB
BOX
WITH
THE
ERROR
MESSAGE
OF
CO
PROCESSOR
NOT
INSTALLED
I
KNOW
ONE
SOLUTION
IS
NOT
TO
PUT
THE
MACHINE
TO
SLEEP
BUT
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEAS
ON
WHAT
COULD
BE
CAUSING
THIS
OR
BETTER
YET
WHAT
MIGHT
FIX
IT
THE
MEMORY
CARD
IS
PSUEDOSTATIC
RAM
AND
GOES
INTO
THE
PDS
SLOT
THAT
PROBABLY
FIGURES
INTO
THE
PROBLEM
THE
MANUFACTURER
IS
KING
MEMORY
NOT
KINGSTON
FROM
IRVINE
CA
THEY
SAY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
IN
MY
MACHINE
ANY
IDEAS
