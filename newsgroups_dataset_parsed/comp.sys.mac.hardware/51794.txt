the
mac

a
low
power
version
of
the

the
mac
portable
run
system
yes
although
it
does
use
up
a
lot
of
memory
is
memory
still
availabe
for
the
portable
there
are
several
vendors
that
still
make
ram
for
the
portable
there
are
two
options
some
vendors
sell
memory
that
plugs
into
the
ram
slot
inside
the
portable
others
sell
memory
that
plugs
into
the
processor
direct
slot
either
way
the
most
memory
you
can
address
is
either
or
megabytes
depending
on
whether
the
portable
is
backlit
or
not
king
memory
and
peripherials
in
irvine
california
is
the
cheapest
place
i
know
of
for
portable
memory
mb
and
mb
i
still
see
several
ads
in
macuser
that
are
selling
mb
modules
for
wide
variety
in
pricing
here
what
is
the
internal
hd
its
a
conner
mb
hd
with
an
average
access
time
of
about
ms
is
the
screen
better
that
the
pb
heavens
yes
the
pb
is
a
backlit
passive
matrix
screen
which
means
it
fades
out
on
you
if
you
move
your
head
a
few
degrees
left
or
right
the
portable
has
a
backlit
or
nonbacklit
active
matrix
screen
which
i
think
is
a
joy
to
read
other
things
to
consider
where
to
get
the
portable
and
how
much
to
pay
for
it
a
good
supplier
has
been
selectterm
in
mass
they
were
willing
to
sell
a
nonbacklit
portable
with
an
internal
bps
modem
for
about
or
a
mb
backlit
portable
with
an
internal
bps
modem
for
about
the
answer
is
call
around
for
a
good
while
or
youll
pay
too
much
im
still
looking
for
an
internal
fax
modem
for
the
portable
