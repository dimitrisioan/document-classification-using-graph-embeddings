I
BELIEVE
IT
GOES
OR
WILL
GO
POWERPC
PENTIUM
I
THINK
THIS
KIND
OF
COMPARISON
IS
PRETTY
USELESS
IN
GENERAL
THE
PROCESSOR
IS
ONLY
GOOD
WHEN
A
GOOD
COMPUTER
IS
DESIGNED
AROUND
IT
ADN
THE
COMPUTER
IS
USED
IN
ITS
DESIGNED
PURPOSE
COMPARING
PROCESSOR
SPEED
IS
PRETTY
DUMB
BECAUSE
ALL
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
JUST
INCREASE
THE
CLOCK
SPEED
TO
INCREASE
SPEED
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
I
MEAN
HOW
CAN
YOU
SAY
A
IS
FASTER
THAN
A
WITHOUT
GIVING
IS
OPERATIONAL
CONDITIONS
CAN
YOU
SAY
THE
SAME
WHEN
YOU
ARE
RUNNING
A
PROGRAM
THAT
USES
A
LOT
OF
TRANSIDENTAL
FUNCTIONS
KNOWING
THAT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TRANSIDENTAL
FUNCTIONS
BUILDING
IN
TO
ITS
FPU
AND
DOES
CAN
YOU
SAY
THAT
IS
STILL
FASTER
ANYWAY
I
HOPE
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
DECIDED
UPON
WETHER
A
COMPUTERS
IS
GOOD
OR
NOT
SOLELY
ON
ITS
PROCESSOR
OR
HOW
FAST
A
PROCESSOR
IS
BASED
ON
ITS
NAME
BECAUSE
ONE
CAN
ALWAY
DO
A
CERTAIN
THINGS
TO
A
PROCESSOR
TO
SPEED
IT
UP
BUT
IF
WE
RESTRICT
OUR
ARGUEMENTS
TO
FOR
EXAMPLE
PURE
PROCESSOR
ARCHITECTURAL
ISSUES
OR
HOW
ONE
PROCESSOR
WILL
WORK
WELL
AND
ANOTHER
WILL
NOT
BASED
ON
ITS
DESIGN
THEN
WE
CAN
GET
SOMEWHERE
WITH
OUR
DISCUSSIONS
CHUNG
YANG
IN
A
RESENT
ARTICLE
IN
ONE
OF
THE
MACMAGS
I
THINK
A
ACCELERATOR
WAS
SLIGHTLY
SLOWER
THAN
A
ACCEL
BUT
THIS
IS
USING
A
SYSTEM
DESIGNED
FOR
THE
SO
IT
STANDS
TO
REASON
THAT
A
SYSTEM
DESIGNED
FOR
AN
IE
QUADRA
WOULD
DO
BETTER
SO
OVERALL
ID
FIGURE
OR
SO
ALONG
THE
SAME
LINES
THE
NEW
POWERPC
STUFF
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
RUN
THE
SYSTEM
AT
THE
LEVEL
OF
A
FAST
QUADRA
BUT
SYSTEM
OR
WHATEVER
WILL
ALLOW
TIMES
THE
SPEED
OF
A
IN
THE
POWERPC
BASED
SYSTEMS
AND
WAIT
FOR
THE
I
THINK
IT
LAPS
