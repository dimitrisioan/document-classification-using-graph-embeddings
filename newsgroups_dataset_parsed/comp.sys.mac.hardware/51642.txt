RE
IISI
CLOCK
UPGRADES
I
TOO
HAVE
BEEN
WATCHING
THE
IISI
SPEEDUP
REPORTS
AND
PLAN
TO
UPGRADE
IN
THE
NEXT
FEW
WEEKS
THE
PLAN
I
HAVE
IS
TO
BUILD
A
SMALL
BOARD
WITH
A
FEW
DIFFERENT
CRYSTALS
ON
IT
AND
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SWITCH
BETWEEN
THE
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
USING
A
FRONT
PANNEL
SWITCH
THIS
WAY
I
CAN
GET
THE
SPEED
WHEN
I
WANT
BUT
I
CAN
ALSO
RUN
AT
SLOWER
STOCK
SPEEDS
IT
I
EXPERIENCE
ANY
COMPATABILITY
PROBLEMS
WITH
ANY
APPLICATIONS
I
DONT
EXPECT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SWITCH
CLOCK
SPEEDS
WITH
THE
SYSTEM
RUNNING
BUT
IF
I
CAN
SWITCH
WITHOUT
ANY
LOCKUP
PROBLEMS
THEN
I
COULD
SWITCH
TO
WHEN
NEEDED
AND
PUT
IT
BACK
TO
IDLE
MHZ
WHEN
NOT
NEEDEED
THIS
WOULD
FURTHER
REDUCE
THE
WEARANDTEAR
ON
THE
CPU
EVEN
WITH
A
HEAT
SINK
OF
COURSE
I
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
RUN
THE
DIFFERENT
CLOCK
SIGNALS
THROUGH
THE
SWITCH
BUT
USE
A
CHIP
OR
TWO
ON
THE
BOARD
TO
SELECT
THE
FREQUENCY
DESIRED
AND
ROUTE
IT
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
MOTHER
BOARD
I
HAVENT
STARTED
PROBING
AROUND
INSIDE
MY
SI
YET
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
THE
VOLTAGE
LEVEL
TO
POWER
THE
CRYSTAL
OSCILATORS
