im
about
to
purchase
a
laser
printer
for
my
mac
and
i
read
the
macuser
buying
guide
special
issue
all
hp
printers
except
iiisi
are
rated
very
low
compared
to
other
noname
bargainpriced
printers
why
is
that
so
on
the
pc
hp
printers
are
the
standard
amongst
printer
manufacturers
ps
my
personnal
favorite
budgetwise
would
be
the
iiip
the
iiip
has
just
been
superseded
by
the
which
is
the
one
i
am
using
at
work
the
quality
of
the
print
is
execellent
beating
dpi
printers
hands
down
in
australia
the
price
of
the
is
about
comparable
with
that
of
the
iiiseries
so
hp
are
trying
to
get
people
to
buy
the
new
one
