DATATRANSFERRATE
OF
THE
NEW
SERIES
MICROPOLIS
HDS
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
FOR
YALL
IM
LOOKING
AT
AN
AD
FOR
THE
NEW
FAST
DRIVES
FROM
MICROPOLIS
IN
THE
JUNE
MACWORLD
I
HAVE
SEEN
SIMILAR
ADS
FOR
THE
IDE
VERSIONS
IN
IBM
PC
MAGAZINES
WELL
THE
AD
SAYS
THAT
ALL
THREE
DRIVES
HAVE
A
FAST
INTERFACE
BUT
THEN
IT
SAYS
THAT
THE
DTR
RATE
FOR
EACH
DRIVE
IS
MEGABYTESSECOND
MAX
HOW
CAN
THIS
BE
I
THOUGHT
THAT
IF
A
DRIVE
WAS
TO
BE
FAST
IT
HAD
TO
HAVE
A
DTR
OF
A
SECOND
I
AM
ASSUMING
THE
CLAIM
BY
MICROPOLIS
IS
FROM
THE
CACHE
I
ADMIT
THAT
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
IMPRESSED
IF
THE
DRIVE
CAN
READWRITE
DATA
AT
A
SECOND
THANK
YOU
