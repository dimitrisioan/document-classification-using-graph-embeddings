ADDING
INT
HARD
DISK
DRIVE
TO
IICX
YES
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
ADD
A
SECOND
HARD
DRIVE
TO
A
MAC
IICX
INTERNALLY
THIS
IS
DEFINITELY
NOT
A
RECOMMENDED
PROCEDURE
BY
APPLE
BUT
I
HAVE
DONE
THE
EQUIVALENT
TO
MY
CX
AFTER
UPGRADING
IT
TO
A
QUADRA
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
IS
STILL
THE
STOCK
CXS
AND
IT
WAS
ABLE
TO
POWER
TWO
QUANTUM
LPS
DRIVES
A
PLI
SCSI
ACCELERATOR
A
MICRON
TECHNOLOGIES
BIT
VIDEO
BOARD
DAYSTAR
QUICKCACHE
NEW
TECHNOLOGIES
OVERDRIVE
AND
MEG
OF
RAM
SIMULTANEOUSLY
I
ADDED
A
NEW
MOUNT
FOR
THE
DRIVE
BY
ATTACHING
ANGLE
BRACKETS
TO
THE
DRIVE
TOWER
THE
INTERNAL
SCSI
CABLE
WAS
CHANGED
TO
A
LONGER
FLAT
RIBBON
CABLE
ONTO
WHICH
I
ADDED
AN
EXTRA
CONNECTOR
ABOUT
MIDWAY
THE
FINAL
HD
WAS
INTERNALLY
TERMINATED
AND
THE
DRIVE
BETWEEN
THE
MOTHERBOARD
AND
FINAL
HD
HAD
ITS
TERMINATOR
RESISTOR
PACKS
REMOVED
COOLING
HAS
NOT
BEEN
A
PROBLEM
AND
NO
SCSI
PROBLEMS
OCCUR
WITH
EITHER
THE
PLI
SCSI
CHAIN
OR
MOTHERBOARD
SCSI
HOOKED
INTO
THE
TWO
INTERNAL
HARD
DRIVES
IT
WORKS
VERY
WELL
FOR
ME
BUT
PROCEED
CAUTIOUSLY
IF
YOU
WISH
TO
DO
THE
SAME
