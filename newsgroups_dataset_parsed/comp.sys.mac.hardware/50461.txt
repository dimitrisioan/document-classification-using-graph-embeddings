CENTRIS
IMPRESSION
I
HAVE
BEEN
PLAYING
WITH
MY
CENTRIS
FOR
ALMOST
A
WEEK
NOW
I
MUST
SAY
THIS
MACHINE
IS
REALLY
FAST
THE
HARDWARE
TURNON
FEATURE
IS
ANNOYING
BUT
I
GOT
POWERKEY
FROM
SOPHISICATED
CIRCUITS
AND
IT
WORKS
LIKE
A
CHARM
HOWEVER
I
STILL
HAVE
A
FEW
COMPLAINTS
WHEN
I
RESTART
THE
MACHINE
EVERY
TIME
THE
SCREEN
IMAGE
THE
DESKTOP
PATTERN
JERKS
UP
AND
DOWN
FOR
A
FEW
TIMES
THE
QUANTUM
DRIVE
IS
NOISY
OVERALL
I
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
IT
IT
IS
FAST
AFFORDABLE
AND
LOOKS
GREAT
