centris
impression
i
have
been
playing
with
my
centris
for
almost
a
week
now
i
must
say
this
machine
is
really
fast
the
hardware
turnon
feature
is
annoying
but
i
got
powerkey
from
sophisicated
circuits
and
it
works
like
a
charm
however
i
still
have
a
few
complaints
when
i
restart
the
machine
every
time
the
screen
image
the
desktop
pattern
jerks
up
and
down
for
a
few
times
the
quantum
drive
is
noisy
overall
i
highly
recommend
it
it
is
fast
affordable
and
looks
great
