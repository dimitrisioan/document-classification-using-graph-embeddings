quadra
clock
modification
long
here
is
how
i
modified
my
quadra
for
higher
speed
previously
i
had
been
using
a
variable
speed
overdrive
for
accelerating
my
cpu
but
this
modification
is
testing
out
as
more
stable
at
higher
speeds
your
mileage
may
vary
the
top
speed
you
achieve
cannot
be
predicted
before
hand
my
personal
has
tested
fine
up
to
mhz
thus
far
i
didnt
have
higher
speed
clock
oscillators
on
hand
to
test
higher
speeds
parts
clock
oscillators
pin
ttl
variety
you
will
need
a
selection
of
speeds
beginning
at
mhz
on
up
the
cpu
will
run
at
the
oscillator
speed
the
original
one
is
a
mhz
unit
i
recommend
getting
a
mhz
clock
in
case
you
damage
the
existing
one
i
obtained
my
clock
oscillators
from
digikey
for
less
than
each
some
of
their
part
numbers
are
mhz
ttl
clock
oscillator
part

mhz
ttl
clock
oscillator
part
dont
get
the
half
size
clock
oscillators
they
wont
fit
there
are
also
cmos
clock
oscillators
i
havent
tried
one
in
a
quadra
they
work
fine
in
iisis
socket
obtain
a
pin
socket
which
is
in
the
same
form
factor
as
a
pin
dip
package
alternatively
use
machined
socket
pins
from
an
augat
style
socket
just
cut
them
out
of
the
socket
cooling
fan
a
very
small
volt
fan
to
keep
the
cpu
cool
is
a
must
my
vso
came
with
a
specially
modified
heatsink
which
had
a
fan
built
onto
it
it
had
a
passthrough
connector
which
tapped
into
the
hard
drive
power
cable
you
should
rig
up
something
similar
or
risk
frying
your
cpu
procedure
insert
usual
disclaimer
and
antistatic
warnings
here
remove
the
top
lid
of
the
machine
you
will
see
the
floppy
disk
and
hard
drive
mounted
in
a
plastic
tower
follow
the
usual
antistatic
precautions
and
of
course
make
sure
the
machine
is
off
when
you
do
this
unplug
all
cables
wall
and
monitor
power
supply
cords
from
the
back
of
the
mac
remove
the
power
supply
by
pulling
the
plastic
interlocking
tab
on
the
tower
forward
and
simultaneously
pulling
the
power
supply
straight
up
the
tab
is
a
piece
of
plastic
from
the
left
posterior
aspect
of
the
tower
which
extends
downward
to
hook
on
to
the
power
supply
you
may
also
feel
a
horseshoe
shaped
piece
at
the
right
portion
of
the
power
supply
leave
that
alone
the
plastic
tab
from
the
tower
is
all
you
need
release
look
at
the
rear
of
the
tower
assembly
you
will
see
the
flat
ribbon
scsi
connector
to
the
hard
drive
a
power
cable
and
a
flat
ribbon
cable
leading
to
the
floppy
drive
disconnect
all
these
from
the
motherboard
the
hard
drive
power
cable
connector
has
a
tab
which
must
be
squeezed
to
release
it
unplug
the
drive
activity
led
from
its
clear
plastic
mount
look
down
the
posterior
cylindrical
section
of
the
plastic
tower
a
phillips
head
screw
is
at
the
base
remove
it
taking
care
not
to
drop
it
into
the
case
a
bit
of
gummy
glue
on
your
screwdriver
is
helpful
here
remove
the
tower
assembly
by
pulling
medially
the
plastic
tab
on
the
right
side
of
the
tower
this
tab
prevents
the
tower
from
sliding
posteriorly
slide
the
entire
tower
assembly
cm
posteriorly
then
lift
the
tower
assembly
straight
up
and
out
of
the
case
remove
the
interrupt
switch
assembly
it
is
a
strangely
shaped
plastic
device
at
the
left
front
edge
of
the
motherboard
pull
the
middle
rear
plastic
prong
up
and
forward
the
entire
device
will
release
unplug
the
speaker
cable
squeeze
the
plastic
tab
on
the
speaker
to
free
it
then
swing
it
backwards
to
free
it
from
the
case
remove
the
motherboard
form
the
case
lift
the
front
right
corner
of
the
motherboard
about
mm
this
allows
it
to
clear
the
clear
plastic
power
light
guide
slide
the
motherboard
forward
about
cm
the
motherboard
then
comes
directly
out
locate
the
mhz
clock
crystal
it
is
a
small
metal
box
near
the
cpu
chip
note
and
remember
its
orientation
the
new
clock
oscillators
must
be
aligned
with
pin
in
the
same
orientation
very
carefully
desolder
and
remove
the
old
clock
oscillator
some
of
the
pins
may
be
bent
over
simply
desolder
then
unbend
them
be
sure
your
desoldering
iron
is
hot
enough
before
heating
the
board
i
used
a
suction
desoldering
iron
to
accomplish
this
task
this
is
not
appropriate
for
a
first
soldering
experience
the
motherboard
is
a
multilayer
design
with
very
fine
traces
easily
damaged
without
proper
care
install
your
socket
or
socket
pins
where
the
old
oscillator
once
was
put
a
mhz
clock
oscillator
into
the
new
socket
you
could
use
the
old
clock
but
it
has
solder
on
its
pins
this
may
come
of
inside
the
socket
and
cause
corrosion
problems
later
i
suggest
using
a
new
mhz
clock
install
your
cooling
fan
system
to
complete
the
modification
reinsert
the
motherboard
and
slide
it
into
place
snap
in
the
interrupt
switch
assembly
and
speaker
to
lock
the
mother
board
firmly
plug
the
speaker
wire
back
into
the
motherboard
reinstall
the
tower
assembly
by
first
placing
the
right
wall
of
the
tower
against
the
right
wall
of
the
case
with
the
tower
assembly
about
cm
posterior
of
its
intended
position
lower
the
tower
assembly
into
place
while
maintaining
contact
with
the
right
wall
of
the
case
once
fully
down
slide
the
tower
assembly
anteriorly
until
it
clicks
into
place
reconnect
the
motherboard
ends
of
the
cables
dontt
forget
the
floppy
drive
cable
replace
the
phillips
head
screw
drop
the
power
supply
straight
down
into
place
until
it
clicks
in
plug
the
hard
drive
activity
light
back
into
its
clear
plastic
mount
reattach
your
cables
and
power
cords
cross
your
fingers
and
turn
on
the
mac
it
should
make
the
usual
power
on
chord
if
it
doesnt
something
is
amiss
immediately
turn
of
the
power
and
recheck
your
handiwork
if
all
is
not
well
you
have
my
sincere
condolences
hopefully
all
will
work
normally
turn
the
machine
back
off
and
replace
the
mhz
clock
oscillator
with
a
faster
one
reboot
and
be
astounded
you
will
need
to
fully
test
the
machine
for
many
hours
before
deciding
a
particular
speed
is
truly
usable
with
my
vso
a
machine
lockup
might
take
hours
of
operation
to
occur
in
the
brief
time
since
modifying
my
clock
oscillator
hours
i
have
not
had
a
single
problem
good
luck
to
all
who
attempt
this
modification
there
is
a
small
but
real
risk
but
you
could
well
reach
quadra
speeds
or
higher
with
less
than
in
parts
