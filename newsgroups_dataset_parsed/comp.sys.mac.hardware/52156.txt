SHOULD
THEY

THE
ELECTRICY
CONSUMPTION
WILL
GO
DOWN
IF
YOU
TURN
THEM
OFF
OVERNIGHT
ALONG
WITH
HEAT
I
WONDER
HOW
HARD
IT
WOULD
BE
IE
WHAT
IT
WOULD
ADD
TO
THE
COST
TO
DESIGN
DESKTOP
MACHINES
WITH
A
POWER
SAVER
FEATURE
BUILT
IN
WHICH
WOULD
REDUCE
POWER
CONSUMPTION
AUTOMATICALLY
IF
THE
MACHINE
IS
IDLE
FOR
MORE
THAN
SOME
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
APPLE
AND
SEVERAL
OTHER
MANUFACTURERS
HAVE
ALREADY
COMMITTED
TO
A
MONITOR
DESIGN
THAT
DOES
JUST
THAT
IT
WAS
ANNOUNCED
ALONG
WITH
THE
NEW
ADMINISTRATIONS
EFFORTS
TO
CUT
WASTE
AND
FUEL
CONSUMPTION
I
KNOW
THAT
IN
THE
BUILDINGS
WHERE

WORK
GIGAWATTS
ARE
WASTED
