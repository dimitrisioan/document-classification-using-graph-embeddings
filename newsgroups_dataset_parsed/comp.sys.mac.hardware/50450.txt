RE
HELP
INSTALL
RAM
ON
CENTRIS
IN
ARTICLE
JASON
HARVEY
TITUS
WRITES
I
HAD
ASKED
EVERYONE
ABOUT
PROBLEMS
INSTALLING
A
MEG
SIMM
AND
AN
MEG
SIMM
IN
MY
CENTRIS
BUT
THE
FOLKS
AT
THE
LOCAL
APPLE
STORE
CALLED
THE
FOLKS
IN
CUPERTINO
AND
FOUND
THAT
YOU
CANT
HAVE
SIMMS
OF
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
IN
ONE
MACHINE
EVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
BOTH
FAST
ENOUGH
IE
MY
NS
MEG
AND
MEG
SIMMS
WERE
INCOMPATIBABLE
JUST
THOUGHT
PEOPLE
MIGHT
WANT
TO
KNOW
THERES
ABSOLUTELY
NO
REASON
WHY
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
DRAM
ACCESS
TIME
ALONE
WOULD
CAUSE
AN
INCOMPATIBILITY
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
ANOTHER
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
SIMMS
FOR
THERE
TO
BE
A
PROBLEM
IVE
OFTEN
USED
MEMORY
OF
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
WHATSOEVER
AS
LONG
AS
ITS
AS
FAST
OR
FASTER
THAN
THE
MINIMUM
REQUIREMENT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
FINE
JUST
OUT
OF
CURIOSITY
DID
YOU
ACTUALLY
TRY
THIS
AND
SEE
A
PROBLEM
OR
WERE
YOU
TOLD
IT
WOULDNT
WORK
AND
SO
NEVER
TRIED
IT
ALSO
OUT
OF
CURIOSITY
DO
YOU
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHO
IN
CUPERTINO
YOU
DEALER
TALKED
TO
AS
ID
LIKE
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
THEYRE
BASING
THIS
RECOMMENDATION
