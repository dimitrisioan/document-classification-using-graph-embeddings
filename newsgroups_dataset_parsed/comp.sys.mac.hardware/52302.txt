RE
LCIII
OR
USED
IICI
WHICH
SHOULD
I
GET
ERIKCHESHIREOXYEDU
ERIK
ADAMS
WRITES
I
AM
AT
LONG
LAST
GOING
TO
REPLACE
MY
BELOVED
I
AM
LOOKING
AT
A
NEW
LC
III
AND
A
USED
IICI
PRICES
HAVE
YET
TO
BE
WORKED
OUT
SO
IM
JUST
THINKING
RIGHT
NOW
ABOUT
THEIR
MERITS
AND
DRAWBACKS
HERES
WHAT
IVE
THOUGHT
OF
THE
IICI
HAS
MUCH
GREATER
POTENTIAL
FOR
EXPANSION
A
LA
NUBUS
AND
GREATER
MEMORY
CAPACITY
THE
LC
III
WOULD
BE
NEW
UNDER
WARRANTY
NEWER
ROMS
IS
THE
IICI
CLEAN
AND
WOULD
HAVE
SOUND
INPUT
I
ALSO
LIKE
THE
PIZZABOX
CASE
PERFORMANCEWISE
I
HAVE
READ
THAT
THEY
ARE
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
THE
LC
III
BEING
A
LITTLE
SLOWER
SO
WHICH
SHOULD
I
GET
ERIK
ERIKCHESHIREOXYEDU
YES
THE
IICI
HAS
CLEAN
ROMS
EITHER
MODEL
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
CHOICE
ANOTHER
OPTION
GET
A
NEW
IICI
FROM
A
DEALER
THAT
HASNT
SOLD
OUT
YET
ALSO
DONT
FORGET
THE
PERFORMA
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
IS
THE
SAME
AS
AN
LCIII
BUT
MAY
BE
PACKAGED
WITH
MORE
GOODIES
FOR
A
BETTER
PRICE
