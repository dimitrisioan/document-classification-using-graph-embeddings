replacing
internal
fdhd
w
floptical
hi
all
i
have
a
iisi
with
a
floppy
drive
that
might
be
bad
and
might
just
be
out
of
alignment
i
havent
checked
yet
if
the
drive
is
not
easily
reparable
id
like
to
replace
it
with
an
internal
floptical
can
this
be
easily
done
can
it
be
done
at
all
im
assuming
that
floptical
drives
can
read
and
write
both
and
floppies
if
this
is
not
in
fact
true
please
tell
me
thanks
