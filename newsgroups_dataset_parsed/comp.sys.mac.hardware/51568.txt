POWERVISION
FOR
PBS
HI
IM
IN
THE
MARKET
FOR
AN
INTERNAL
COLOR
VIDEO
ADAPTOR
FOR
MY
PB
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
HAS
USED
THE
POWERVISION
ADAPTOR
MADE
BY
MIRROR
IF
SO
CAN
YOU
TELL
ME
HOW
FEEL
ABOUT
THE
SPEED
AND
COMPATABILITY
OF
IT
I
MIGHT
ALSO
BE
INTERESTED
IN
OTHER
BOARDS
BY
ENVISIO
ETC
SO
IF
YOU
HAVE
SUCH
A
BOARD
PLEASE
EMAIL
YOUR
OPINION
OF
IT
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
JOHN
