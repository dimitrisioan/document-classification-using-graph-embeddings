LIBERATING
HIS

NIGHTMARE
CAUSED

THIS
WOULD
MAKE
ME
A
BIT
SUSPECT
OF
MR
RAMSEYS
QUALIFICATIONS
AS
A
SELFSTYLED
EXPERT
IN
FACT
WHEN
I
READ
ABOUT
ANYBODY
USING
VIRTUAL
MEMORY
REGULARLY
I
KIND
OF
WONDER
YES
ONE
CAN
SOMETIMES
GET
AWAY
WITH
RUNNING
A
NEWER
ROM
OF
THE
CORRECT
SIZE
OBVIOUSLY
IN
AN
OLDER
MACHINE
BUT
ONE
SHOULD
BE
PREPARED
FOR
PROBLEMS
IF
RUNNING
SOFTWARE
THAT
CHECKS
FOR
MACHINE
TYPE
RATHER
THAN

TRAP
AVAILABILITY
AND
THEN
DRAWS
INCORRECT
CONCLUSIONS
WHEN

STUFF
IN
THIS
PARTICULAR

I
SEE
NO
REASON

SURE
BUY

SHOPPER
OR

OF
THE
MAC
TRADES
FOR

NUMBERS
AND
ASK
FOR
A
PRICE
ON
A
IICI

EVERYTHING
HAS
A
PRICE
IF
YOU
HAPPEN
TO
FIND
SOMEBODY
WHO
SALVAGED
A
IICI
WITH
A
DEAD
MOTHERBOARD
YOU
MIGHT
GET
A
DECENT
PRICE
THERE
IS
PROBABLY
A
MARKET
FOR
USED

AS
WELL
SO
THEY
MIGHT
SELL
A

ANYWAY
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
IM
INTERESTED
IN
PURCHASING

BE
A
