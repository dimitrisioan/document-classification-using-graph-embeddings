A
FRIEND
IS
HEAVILY
INTO
MIDI
AND
IS
USING
A
QUADRA
MAYBE
WITH
ALL
BUT
ONE
NUBUS
SLOT
POPULATED
WITH
ARCANE
MUSIC
HARDWARE
AND
A
VIDEO
CARD
HE
REPORTS
BIT
VIDEO
IS
TOO
SLOW
FOR
GOOD
REALTIME
DISPLAY
OF
WHAT
HE
NEEDS
TO
SEE
HE
ALSO
REPORTS
THAT
THE
BUILTIN
VIDEO
IS
EVEN
WORSE
HES
NOT
A
MAC
GURU
AND
I
HAVENT
SEEN
THE
SYSTEM
SO
THIS
IS
ABOUT
ALL
I
KNOW
I
SUSPECT
THAT
HIS
NUBUS
IS
HEAVILY
LOADED
AND
THINK
IMPROVEMENTS
MIGHT
COME
FROM
A
SWITCH
TO
AN
ACCELERATED
PDS
SLOT
VIDEO
CARD
DOES
THIS
SOUND
RIGHT
WHO
MAKES
A
PDS
ACCELERATED
VIDEO
CARD
FOR
THE
QUADRA
THATS
WORTH
LOOKING
AT
ANY
OTHER
SUGGESTIONS
