basically
the
mac
pluses
are
constantly
rebooting
themselves
as
if
the
reboot
button
were
being
pushed
sometimes
the
mac
is
able
to
fully
boot
and
display
the
desktop
but
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
it
reboots
again
at
times
the
frequency
is
as
high
as
several
times
a
minute
i
wonder
if
your
mac
has
those
little
reset
interupt
switches
installed
they
are
plastic
devices
that
push
on
the
switches
which
are
inside
the
mac
or
mabey
those
switches
are
bad
and
need
replacing
this
problem
is
usually
a
low
vdc
from
the
power
supply
there
is
an
adjustment
for
this
on
the
supply
if
the
voltage
is
still
unstable
or
low
then
the
culprit
is
probably
a
bad
rectifier
