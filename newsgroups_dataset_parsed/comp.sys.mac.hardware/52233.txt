it
happened
to
my
classic
ii
once
at
startup
after
the
usual
powerup
tone
there
were
chimes
kinda
like
or
c
e
g
c
on
the
music
scale
and
it
hanged
before
giving
the
happy
mac
i
had
to
repowerup
this
was
asked
before
but
i
cant
remember
the
answer
ive
tried
to
find
the
answer
from
the
faqs
and
other
ftp
sites
but
to
no
avail
can
anyone
tell
me
what
those
unusual
chimes
mean
a
spurious
memory
check
error
thanks
willie
those
chimes
indicate
a
hardware
failure
of
some
type
during
system
startup
one
thing
that
can
cause
the
chimes
is
a
cable
that
has
become
a
bit
loose
next
time
you
power
down
the
computer
check
that
all
cables
are
on
tight
