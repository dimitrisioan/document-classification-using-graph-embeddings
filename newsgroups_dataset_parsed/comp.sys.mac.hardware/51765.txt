WHY
DOES
APPLE
GIVE
US
A
CONFUSING
MESSAGE
IN
ARTICLE
MONTHIAN
WRITES
HI
THERE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHY
APPLE
HAS
AN
AMBIGUOUS
MESSAGE
FOR
REGARDING
FPU
IN
ALL
MAC
PRICE
LISTS
IVE
SEEN
EVERY
HAS
THE
MESSAGE
FPU
OPTIONAL
I
KNOW
FROM
WHAT
WEVE
DISCUSSED
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
THAT
ALL
HAVE
THE
FPU
BUILT
IN
EXCEPT
THE
CONFIGURATION
WHY
WOULD
THEY
BE
SO
UNCLEAR
ABOUT
THIS
ISSUE
IN
THEIR
PRICE
LIST
IM
PLANNING
TO
BUY
THE
PRETTY
SOON
BUT
IM
NOW
GETTING
CONFUSED
WITH
WHETHER
IT
COMES
WITH
FPU
OR
NOT
WHY
SAY
OPTIONAL
IF
ITS
BUILT
IN
PLEASE
ANYBODY
HELP
ME
UNDERSTAND
THIS
GAME
REGARDS
THIAN
IF
YOU
GET
THE
CENTRIS
WITH
CD
CONFIGURATION
YOU
ARE
GETTING
A
MAC
WITH
A
PROCESSOR
THAT
HAS
BUILTIN
MATH
COPROCESSOR
SUPPORT
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THAT
THE
OPTIONAL
FPU
REFERS
TO
YOUR
OPTION
OF
PURCHASING
THE
CENTRIS
WITHOUT
FPU
OR
ONE
OF
THE
OTHER
CONFIGURATIONS
WITH
FPU
APPLE
DOES
NOT
OFFER
AN
UPGRADE
FROM
THE
NONFPU
SYSTEM
TO
BECOME
AN
FPU
SYSTEM
AND
IT
IS
UNCLEAR
WHETHER
THE
PROCESSOR
ON
THE
NONFPU
SYSTEM
A
CAN
BE
REPLACED
WITH
A
SUPPLIED
BY
ANOTHER
VENDOR
APPLE
DID
SEND
A
MEMO
OUT
AT
ONE
POINT
SATING
THAT
THE
CENTRIS
WHICH
ONLY
COMES
WITH
A
NONFPU
PROCESSOR
CANNOT
BE
UPGRADED
TO
SUPPORT
AN
FPU
THE
PIN
CONFIGURATIONS
OF
THE
TWO
CHIPS
APPARENTLY
DO
NOT
MATCH
SO
YOU
CANNOT
SWAP
ONE
FOR
ANOTHER
AGAIN
ACCORDING
TO
