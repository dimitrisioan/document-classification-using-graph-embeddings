RE
TO
FIX
TRACKBALL
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
THE
TRACKBAL
ON
MY
NO
LONGER
MOVES
IN
THE
HORIZONTAL
DIRECTION
WHEN
I
CALLED
THE
NEAREST
AUTHORIZED
APPLE
SERVICE
PERSON
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
PROBABLY
NEEDED
REPLACING
AND
THAT
WOULD
COST
ME
OVER
OUCH
CAN
ANYONE
RECOMMEND
A
LESS
EXPENSIVE
WAY
TO
FIX
THIS
PROBLEM
ONE
STRANGE
SYMPTOM
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
WHEN
I
TAKE
THE
BALL
OUT
OF
THE
SOCKET
AND
SHINE
A
LIGHT
INTO
THE
HOLE
I
CAN
MAKE
THE
CURSOR
MOVE
HORIZONTALLY
BY
MOVING
THE
WHEEL
WITH
MY
FINGER
IT
WORKS
FINE
THAT
WAY
BUT
WONT
WORK
IF
I
TURN
OFF
THE
LIGHT
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
OR
COMMENTS
BEN
ROY
JUST
A
POOR
COLLEGE
BEN
SINCE
YOURE
OBVIOUSLY
ADEPT
ENOUGH
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THE
TRACKBALL
WORKS
THE
ONLY
THING
SHORT
OF
REPAIRING
IT
THAT
I
CAN
THINK
OF
IS
A
THOROUGH
CLEANING
OF
ALL
THE
PARTS
AND
THEN
CHECKING
FOR
THE
PROPER
PLACEMENT
OF
THE
LITTLE
BLUE
ROLLERS
SINCE
THEY
ARENT
FIXED
IN
POSITION
ON
THEIR
STAINLESS
STEEL
PINS
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
SLIDING
THEM
INTO
A
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
POSITION
ON
MY
POWERBOOK
I
CAN
SLIDE
THEM
ALMOST
COMPLETELY
OUT
OF
CONTACT
WITH
THE
TRACKBALL
IN
FACT
ONE
OF
THE
NOTES
FROM
SUMEX
ON
FIXING
THE
TRACKBALL
ADVOCATES
SLIDING
THE
ROLLER
SO
THAT
ITS
EDGE
CONTACTS
THE
BALL
NOT
THE
CENTER
CYLINDRICAL
AREA
IVE
DONE
THIS
WITH
MY
AND
IT
DOES
SEEM
TO
IMPROVE
THE
FEEL
BUT
NEEDS
TO
BE
ADJUSTED
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
I
JUST
POPPED
OPEN
ONE
OF
OUR
OFFICES
AND
WHILE
THERE
ISNT
AS
MUCH
LATITUDE
FOR
MOVEMENT
ONE
COULD
STILL
ADJUST
THE
ROLLER
SLIGHTLY
IF
YOUR
IS
THE
SAME
IT
MIGHT
HELP
I
WOULD
SUSPECT
THE
MOST
LIKELY
CULPRIT
TO
BE
A
SLIPPERY
BLUE
ROLLER
IF
YOU
CAN
TAKE
IT
OUT
CLEAN
IT
WITH
A
MILD
SOAPY
SOLUTION
OR
ISOPROPYL
ALCOHOL
ALSO
BE
SURE
THE
BALL
IS
GREASEFREE
IF
YOU
DROP
THE
BALL
IN
MINUS
THE
RETAINING
RING
ROLL
THE
BALL
AND
SEE
IF
IT
IS
ACTUALLY
CAUSING
THE
AXLE
TO
SPIN
IF
ALL
THIS
STILL
DOESNT
SOLVE
IT
THEN
MAYBE
A
NEW
ONE
IS
IN
ORDER
IT
COULD
BE
AN
ELECTRICAL
CONNECTION
IN
WHICH
CASE
REPLACEMENT
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
BUT
MY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
BOTH
MICE
AND
TRACKBALLS
HAS
BEEN
THAT
DIRT
HAS
BEEN
THE
NORMAL
PROBLEM
NOT
AN
ELECTRICAL
MALFUNCTION
