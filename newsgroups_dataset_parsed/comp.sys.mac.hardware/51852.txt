TROUBLE
W
VGA
DISPLAYS
IM
CURRENTLY
HAVING
TROUBLE
CONNECTING
MY
PB
TO
A
TRUE
BLUE
IBM
MODEL
VGA
MONITOR
THE
DISPLAY
IS
BEARLY
READABLE
BUT
ALL
THE
DETAILS
ARE
SEPERATED
INTO
YELLOW
AND
RED
COLORS
IE
A
WINDOW
WILL
HAVE
TWO
IMAGES
ONE
IN
YELLOW
AND
A
GHOST
IMAGE
IN
RED
THE
BACKGROUND
IS
ALSO
A
LITTLE
GREENISH
I
READ
SOME
TIME
AGO
BEFORE
I
EVER
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
HOOK
MY
MAC
UP
TO
A
VGA
SCREEN
ABOUT
AN
INCOMPATABILITY
WITH
SOME
VGA
MONITORS
DUE
TO
THE
SYNC
ON
GREEN
SIGNAL
DOES
THIS
SOUND
LIKE
IT
COULD
BE
THE
SAME
DEMON
I
ALSO
READ
THAT
THERE
ARE
BOTH
HARDWARE
PUTTING
A
DIODE
ON
THE
GREEN
SIGNAL
SOLUTION
AND
A
SOFTWARE
SOLUTION
TO
THIS
PROBLEM
I
DONT
THE
DETAILS
DOES
SOMEBODY
HAVE
THEM
THE
CAN
EMAIL
TO
ME
OR
POST
THEM
I
CHECKED
ALL
THE
FAQS
FOR
THIS
AND
DIDNT
FIND
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
DID
I
MISS
IT
SOMEWHERE
THIS
SURE
SEEMS
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
THING
TO
HAVE
IN
ONE
THANKS
FOR
ANY
