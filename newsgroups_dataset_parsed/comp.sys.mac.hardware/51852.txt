trouble
w
vga
displays
im
currently
having
trouble
connecting
my
pb
to
a
true
blue
ibm
model
vga
monitor
the
display
is
bearly
readable
but
all
the
details
are
seperated
into
yellow
and
red
colors
ie
a
window
will
have
two
images
one
in
yellow
and
a
ghost
image
in
red
the
background
is
also
a
little
greenish
i
read
some
time
ago
before
i
ever
thought
i
would
hook
my
mac
up
to
a
vga
screen
about
an
incompatability
with
some
vga
monitors
due
to
the
sync
on
green
signal
does
this
sound
like
it
could
be
the
same
demon
i
also
read
that
there
are
both
hardware
putting
a
diode
on
the
green
signal
solution
and
a
software
solution
to
this
problem
i
dont
the
details
does
somebody
have
them
the
can
email
to
me
or
post
them
i
checked
all
the
faqs
for
this
and
didnt
find
anything
about
it
did
i
miss
it
somewhere
this
sure
seems
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
in
one
thanks
for
any
replys
