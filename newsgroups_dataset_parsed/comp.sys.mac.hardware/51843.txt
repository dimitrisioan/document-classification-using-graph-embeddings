HARD
DRIVE
PROBLEM
I
HAVE
AN
WITH
A
MEG
HD
WHICH
DATES
BACK
TO
APRIL
WHEN
I
ORIGINALLY
PURCHASED
IT
I
EXPERIENCED
THE
FAILURE
TO
BOOT
PROBLEM
THIS
WAS
FIXED
SOON
AFTER
BY
A
ROM
UPGRADE
ON
THE
HARD
DRIVE
LATELY
A
SIMILAR
PROBLEM
HAS
BEEN
OCCURING
WHEN
THE
COMPUTER
IS
POWERED
ON
THE
HD
LIGHT
FLASHES
A
FEW
TIMES
AND
THEN
I
AM
GIVEN
THE
NO
DISK
TO
BOOT
FROM
ICON
HOWEVER
UPON
TURING
THE
COMPUTER
OFF
AND
ON
AGAIN
THE
DRIVE
ALWAYS
BOOTS
UP
JUST
FINE
FURTHERMORE
IF
INSTEAD
OF
TURNING
THE
POWER
ON
AND
OFF
I
PRESS
THE
REBOOT
BUTTON
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
OCCURS
BUT
AS
I
SAID
TURNING
THE
POWER
OFF
AND
ON
ALWAYS
WORKS
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
BOOT
PROBLEM
IN
THAT
BEFORE
IT
OFTEN
REQUIRED
SEVERAL
POWER
OFF
AND
ONS
TO
GET
IT
TO
BOOT
DOES
ANYBODY
HAVE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
AS
TO
WHAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
OR
HOW
IT
CAN
BE
FIXED
IM
WONDERING
IF
ITS
GETTING
OLD
AND
REQUIRES
MORE
TIME
TO
COME
UP
TO
SPEED
NOW
IS
THERE
A
PRAM
OR
SCSI
SETTING
THAT
ALLOWS
ME
TO
TELL
THE
COMPUTER
TO
WAIT
A
LITTLE
LONGER
BEFORE
TRYING
TO
ACCESS
THE
HD
