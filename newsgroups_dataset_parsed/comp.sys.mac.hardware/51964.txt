basically
the
mac
pluses
are
constantly
rebooting
themselves
as
if
the
reboot
button
were
being
pushed
sometimes
the
mac
is
able
to
fully
boot
and
display
the
desktop
but
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
before
it
reboots
again
at
times
the
frequency
is
as
high
as
several
times
a
minute
i
wonder
if
your
mac
has
those
little
reset
interupt
switches
installed
they
are
plastic
devices
that
push
on
the
switches
which
are
inside
the
mac
or
mabey
those
switches
are
bad
and
need
replacing
i
wish
i
caught
the
original
post
but
anyway
the
problem
is
that
the
pluss
poor
old
power
supply
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
analog
sweep
board
is
on
its
way
out
apart
from
a
board
swap
bikkies
to
apple
theres
not
much
the
average
joe
can
do
to
fix
it
you
can
of
course
try
and
readjust
the
voltage
levels
the
rail
should
be
as
close
to
as
you
cn
get
it
but
this
is
more
often
than
not
a
temporary
fix
a
copy
of
larry
pinas
macntosh
repair
upgrade
secrets
is
a
worthwhile
investment
for
the
serious
