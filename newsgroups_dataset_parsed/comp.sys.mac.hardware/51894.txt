I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
SPECIFIC
PROBLEM
MENTIONED
IN
YOUR
MESSAGE
BUT
I
DEFINITELY
HAD
SCSI
PROBLEMS
BETWEEN
MY
AND
MY
VENERABLE
JASMINE
MEGADRIVE
CARTRIDGE
DRIVES
MY
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
GET
SILVERLINING
NONE
OF
THE
LOOPS
THAT
INVOLVED
BLIND
WRITES
WORKED
TO
THE
DRIVES
OP
THAT
WORKED
WAS
THE
MACINTOSH
SOFTWARE
LOOP
WHATEVER
THAT
MEANS
I
DOUBT
THIS
IS
A
QUADRASPECIFIC
PROBLEM
I
HAD
TO
GET
RID
OF
MY
VENERABLE
BERNOULLI
LAST
YEAR
WITH
ENOUGH
CARTRIDGES
PURCHASED
AT
EACH
TO
MAKE
THE
WHOLE
THING
WORTH
MORE
THAN
MY
WHOLE
COMPUTER
THE
TECH
SUPPORT
GUYS
AT
OCEAN
MICROSYSTEMS
SUGGESTED
THAT
SOME
THIRDPARTY
DRIVERS
MIGHT
FIX
THE
PROBLEM
IN
MY
CASE

CARTRIDGES
WOULDNT
FORMATMOUNTPARTITION
FOR
AUX
HAT
THE
MEGADRIVES
WORKED
PERFECTLY
ON
BOTH
MY
MAC
PLUS
AND
MY
POWERBOOK
IT
WAS
FOR
THIS
REASON
I
ASSUMED
THE
PROBLEM
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
QUADRA
EVEN
WITH
THE
QUADRA
THEY
MOSTLY
WORKED
OK
THE
PROBLEM
OCCURRED
WHEN
I
EJECTED
A
CARTRIDGE
FROM
A
DRIVE
IT
WOULD
START
POPPING
UP
DIALOG
BOXES
SAYING
THIS
CARTRIDGE
MUST
BE
FORMATTED
WITH
JASMINE
DRIVEWARE
EVEN
THOUGH
THERE
WAS
NO
CARTRIDGE
IN
THE
DRIVE
MARK
T
TO
FORMAT
