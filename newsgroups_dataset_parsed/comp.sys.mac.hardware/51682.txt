iisi
clockupgraded
iisi
works
well
at
however
does
not
work
with
nubus
adaptor
and
disk
even
though
it
can
readwrite
disk
interestingly
upgraded
iisi
overcomes
basically
the
fighting
between
the
vedio
and
the
system
so
that
cpu
never
be
reduced
below
no
mater
whether
the
cache
is
on
or
off
this
is
pretty
useful
when
you
use
the
virtual
memory
of
system
cpu
graf
disk
