re
duo
crashes
aftersleep
looks
like
apple
bug
if
you
have
a
memory
card
installed
thats
not
one
of
apples
this
may
be
the
problem
for
a
couple
of
months
after
the
release
of
the
duo
some
memory
manufacturers
were
shipping
duo
memory
cards
w
improper
nonselfrefreshing
chips
if
you
have
a
third
party
card
pull
it
and
see
if
the
sleep
problem
recurs
