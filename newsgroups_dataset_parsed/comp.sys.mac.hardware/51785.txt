MY

RECENTLY
PURCHASED
A
LC

AND
HE
WANTS
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
DEMON
CALLED
NUBUS
ADAPTER
FOR
HIS
PDS
SLOT
THE
LC
FAMILY
OF
MACS
CAN
ONLY
USE
PDS
CARDS
THEY
ARE
NOT
ABLE
TO
USE
NUBUS
AH
BUT
WHY
CAN
SOME
TECHNICALLYHIP
MACSLINGER
TELL
US
WHAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
BETWEEN
PDS
AND
NUBUS
IS
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
MAKE
A
GADGET
THAT
PLUGS
INTO
PDS
AND
ENDS
IN
A
NUBUS

FOR
