my
friend
recently
purchased
a
lc
iii
and
he
wants
to
know
if
there
is
such
a
demon
called
nubus
adapter
for
his
pds
slot
the
lc
family
of
macs
can
only
use
pds
cards
they
are
not
able
to
use
nubus
ah
but
why
can
some
technicallyhip
macslinger
tell
us
what
the
difference
is
between
pds
and
nubus
is
it
impossible
to
make
a
gadget
that
plugs
into
pds
and
ends
in
a
nubus
card
cage
at
least
marvins
friend
has
not
been
able
to
locate
one
and
neither
have
i
what
is
the
fundamental
reason

this

second
wave
makes
nubus
card
cages
that
work
on
the
pds
slots
of
at
least
three
macs
the
iisi
and
centris
they
have
not
to
my
knowledge
announced
such
a
device
for
the
lcii
but
they
could
make
one
technologically
the
pds
card
that
goes
to
the
cage
simply
needs
the
nubus
controller
circuitry
present
on
nubus
macs
why
though
does
anyone
care
about
this
dgr
has
a
threepds
adapter
for
the
lclcii
they
will
soon
have
one
for
the
lciii
pds
is
better
than
nubus
for
most
people
in
most
applications
granted
there
are
more
nubus
cards
but
most
applications
that
require
a
nubus
card
like
fullmotion
video
capture
shouldnt
be
done
on
an
lclciilciii
anyway
