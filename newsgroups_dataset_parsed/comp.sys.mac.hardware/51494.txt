PROBLEMHELP
WE
HAVE
RECENTLY
OBTAINED
A
CENTRIS
AND
IT
HAS
DEVELOPED
AN
UNUSUAL
VIDEO
PROBLEM
MODEL
WITH
HD
VRAM
NO
CARDS
MONITOR
APPLE
WHEN
THE
COMPUTER
IS
SET
FOR
COLORS
AND
CERTAIN
OPERATIONS
ARE
DONE
PARTICULARLY
VERTICAL
SCROLLING
THROUGH
A
WINDOW
HORIZONTAL
WHITE
LINES
APPEAR
ON
THE
MONITOR
WHICH
GENERALLY
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
SPARE
OPEN
WINDOWS
THESE
LINES
ACCUMMULATE
AS
THE
OPERATION
IS
CONTINUED
IF
A
WINDOW
IS
MOVED
OVER
THE
INVOLVED
AREA
OF
THE
SCREEN
AND
THEN
MOVED
AWAY
THE
LINE
DISAPPEAR
FROM
THAT
AREA
OF
THE
SCREEN
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
OBSERVED
IF
THE
MONITOR
IS
CONFIGURED
FOR
COLORS
OR
A
INCH
APPLE
MONITOR
WITH
COLORS
IS
USED
I
SUSPECT
A
BAD
VIDEO
RAM
CHIP
BUT
CANNOT
BE
CERTAIN
THE
PROBLEM
HAS
BEEN
APPARENT
SINCE
DAY
BUT
HAS
GOTTEN
WORSE
WE
WERE
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
HAS
SEEN
ANYTHING
LIKE
THIS
AND
IF
SO
HOW
TO
FIX
IT
PLEASE
