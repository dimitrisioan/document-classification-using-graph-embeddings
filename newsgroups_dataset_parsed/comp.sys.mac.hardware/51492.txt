problems
with
arose
does
anyone
work
with
the
arose
card
we
have
the
problem
that
after
certain
crashes
the
card
disappears
from
the
system
and
lets
crash
the
mac
then
okay
we
dont
use
the
card
quite
like
one
should
because
we
simulate
errors
in
the
before
every
instruction
some
specified
registers
are
masked
eg
to
simulate
a
in
certain
bits
normally
the
crash
instance
of
arose
notices
a
crash
sets
a
flag
and
stops
working
by
reading
the
mentioned
flag
the
mac
can
notice
a
card
crash
that
works
fine
for
almost
all
crashes
but
as
said
sometimes
the
card
doesnt
set
the
flag
and
disappears
from
the
system
the
documentation
of
arose
does
not
tell
us
anything
about
its
behavior
when
crashing
and
so
at
the
moment
we
are
trying
to
understand
by
analyzing
the
assembler
code
and
thats
both
frustrating
and
lengthy
so
can
anyone
help
please
only
reply
via
email
as
i
dont
