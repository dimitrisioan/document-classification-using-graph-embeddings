ACCELERATED
MAC
PLUS
PROBLEMS
HELLO
I
RECENTLY
ACCELERATED
MY
MAC
PLUS
MICROMAC
ACCELERATOR
AND
NOW
I
CANT
GET
MY
MAC
TO
BOOT
OFF
OF
THE
HARD
DISK
IT
BOOTS
FINE
FROM
A
FLOPPY
AND
I
CAN
MOUNT
THE
HARD
DISK
USING
SCSI
PROBE
BUT
I
CANNOT
GET
IT
TO
BOOT
FROM
THE
HARD
DRIVE
I
INSTALLED
A
NEW
DRIVER
SO
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
IS
THE
PROBLEM
THIS
POSES
A
RATHER
LARGE
PROBLEM
I
ONLY
HAVE
MEG
OF
RAM
AND
I
NEED
TO
RUN
MATHEMATICA
WHICH
REQUIRES
MEG
I
WAS
HOPING
TO
USE
SYSTEM
VIRTUAL
MEMORY
SO
THAT
I
COULD
RUN
MATHEMATICA
HOWEVER
I
CANT
RUN
SYSTEM
FROM
A
FLOPPY
SO
I
CANT
GET
ENOUGH
RAM
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
TIME
