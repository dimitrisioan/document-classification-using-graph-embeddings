accelerated
mac
plus
problems
hello
i
recently
accelerated
my
mac
plus
micromac
accelerator
and
now
i
cant
get
my
mac
to
boot
off
of
the
hard
disk
it
boots
fine
from
a
floppy
and
i
can
mount
the
hard
disk
using
scsi
probe
but
i
cannot
get
it
to
boot
from
the
hard
drive
i
installed
a
new
driver
so
i
dont
think
that
is
the
problem
this
poses
a
rather
large
problem
i
only
have
meg
of
ram
and
i
need
to
run
mathematica
which
requires
meg
i
was
hoping
to
use
system
virtual
memory
so
that
i
could
run
mathematica
however
i
cant
run
system
from
a
floppy
so
i
cant
get
enough
ram
any
suggestions
thanks
for
your
time
