where
to
get
power
cord
to
plug
nonapple
monitor
into
quadra
power
supply
i
have
a
sony
whch
i
would
like
to
hook
up
so
that
i
get
its
power
though
my
quadra
power
supply
ie
if
i
had
an
apple
monitor
i
could
plug
the
monitor
directly
into
the
computer
so
that
when
i
hit
the
power
button
the
keyboard
both
the
monitor
and
computer
go
on
and
when
i
shut
down
both
go
off
is
there
an
extension
cord
type
cable
i
can
buy
which
allows
me
to
plug
my
existing
power
cord
into
and
then
plug
this
extension
cable
into
my
quadra
any
thoughts
and
comments
would
be
appreciated
thanks
in
advance
