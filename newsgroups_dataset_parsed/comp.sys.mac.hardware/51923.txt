CAN
ANYONE
TELL
ME
WHAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
BETWEEN
A
DRAM
CHIP
AND
A
SIMM
I
NEED
THE
FORMER
I
THINK
TO
ADD
MEMORY
TO
MY
LASERWRITER
LS
SOMEONE
IS
OFFERING
TO
SELL
ME
SIMMS
HE
REMOVED
FROM
AN
SE
BUT
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THIS
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
CORRECT
FORM
OF
MEMORY
THE
SOCKETS
IN
THE
LASERWRITER
LOOK
LIKE
THEY
WANT
THE
SPIDERYSHAPED
CHIPS
THERE
ARE
SOCKETS
EACH
WITH
AS
I
RECALL
PINS

BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
IVE
NEVER
ACTUALLY
SEEN
A

A
SIMM
IS
A
KILOBYTE

THE
SIMM
IS
A

WITH
A

AND
ON
THE
SIMM
ARE
KILOBIT
DRAM
CHIPS
MAKING
THE

YOU
ARE
CORRECT
ASSUMING
THAT
SIMMS
WILL
NOT
FIT
INTO
A
LASERWRITER
APPLE
PRINTERS
EITHER
REQUIRE
PIN
SIMMS
LIKE
THOSE
IN
THE

OR
SPECIAL

CONTACT
YOUR

EXACTLY
WHAT
KIND
OF

YOU
NEED
