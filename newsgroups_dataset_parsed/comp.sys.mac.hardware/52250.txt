JAY
SCOTT
WRITES
A
REP
AT
THE
DEALER
ACTUALLY
ITS
A
UNIVERSITY
ORDER
CENTER
SO
THEY
DONT
HAVE
ANY
IMMEDIATE
FINANCIAL
INTEREST
TOLD
ME
THAT
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
HAVING
LOTS
OF
PROBLEMS
WITH
THEIR
CENTRIS
HE
DIDNT
GO
INTO
DETAILS
BUT
MENTIONED
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
AND
INTERMITTENT
PROBLEMS
WITH
PRINTING
FILES
IT
SOUNDED
TO
ME
LIKE
THEY
WERE
HAVING
BOTH
HARDWARE
PROBLEMS
AND
SOFTWARE
COMPATIBILITY
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
MACHINE
DELETED
SO
WHAT
DOES
THE
NET
THINK
DID
THE
DEALER
JUST
GET
ONE
FLAKY
MACHINE
OR
DID
APPLE
SEND
THE
OUT
THE
DOOR
TOO
EARLY
IS
YOUR
WORKING
JUST
GREAT
OR
IS
IT
BUGGY
TOO
A
LOT
OF
THE
TIME
WHEN
YOURE
DEALING
WITH
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
NO
FINANCIAL
INTEREST
IN
SELLING
YOU
THE
MACHINE
YOU
GET
A
LOT
OF
OPINION
AS
OPPOSED
TO
FACTUAL
INFORMATION
ETC
WHAT
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
TO
ME
IS
THAT
THIS
GUY
HAS
HAD
AN
EXPERIENCE
WITH
ONE
FLAKY
CENTRIS
AND
FORMED
AN
ALLENCOMPASSING
OPINION
ON
THE
REST
OF
THE
IVE
SEEN
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
FRUSTRATED
ME
TO
NO
END
BECAUSE
THEY
REFUSED
TO
BELIEVE
ANY
OTHER
MAC
XYZ
WOULD
BE
ANY
GOOD
SINCE
THEIR
EXPERIENCE
WITH
ONE
MACHINE
WITH
A
MAC
XYZ
HAD
BEEN
BAD
THEIR
LOSS
