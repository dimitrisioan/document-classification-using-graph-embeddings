APPLEONE
SCANNER
AND
PRINTING
QUALITY
WE
JUST
RECEIVED
AN
APPLEONE
COLOR
SCANNER
FOR
OUR
LAB
HOWEVER
I
AM
HAVING
TROUBLE
GETTING
REASONABLE
SCANNED
OUTPUT
WHEN
PRINTING
A
SCANNED
PHOTO
ON
A
LASERWRITER
IIG
I
HAVE
TRIED
SCANNING
AT
A
HIGHER
RESOLUTION
AND
THE
DISPLAY
ON
THE
SCREEN
APPEARS
VERY
NICE
HOWEVER
THE
PRINTED
VERSION
IS
COMING
OUT
UGLY
IS
THIS
DUE
TO
THE
RESOLUTION
CAPABILITIES
OF
THE
PRINTER
OR
ARE
THERE
TRICKS
INVOLVED
TO
GET
BETTER
QUALITY
OR
SHOULD
WE
BE
GETTING
SOMETHING
LIKE
PHOTOSHOP
TO
PRETTY
UP
THE
IMAGE
I
WILL
APPRECIATE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
