GARY
SAGER
WRITES
WORK
IT
WAS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THIS
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
DONE
WITH
MONITORS
WITH
THE
POWER
SWITCH
ON
FRONT
THIS
IS
A
PET
PEEVE
OF
MINE
I
WISH
COMPANIES
WOULD
PUT
POWER
SWITCHES
ON
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
EQUIPMENT
IF
MY
APPLE
MONITOR
HAD
THE
SWITCH
ON
THE
FRONT
I
WOULD
HAPPILY
POWER
IT
OFF
AT
NIGHT
ALMOST
EVERY
PIECE
OF
COMPUTER
EQUIPMENT
I
OWNUSE
HAS
THE
SWITCH
ON
THE
BACK
INCLUDING
EXTERNAL
HARD
DRIVES
AND
MODEMSWHY
I
HOPE
FRONTMOUNTED
SWITCHES
BECOME
THE
NORM
AND
SOON
IT
IS
JUST
EXTRA
WIRE
AND
WORK
TO
PUT
THE
SWITCH
IN
FRONT
USUALLY
THE
EASIEST
PLACE
TO
PUT
THE
SWITCH
IS
WHEREVER
THE
POWER
CORD
ENTERS
THE
MACHINE
AND
PEOPLE
HATE
POWER
CORDS
ON
THE
FRONT
I
PREFER
A
POWER
STRIP
