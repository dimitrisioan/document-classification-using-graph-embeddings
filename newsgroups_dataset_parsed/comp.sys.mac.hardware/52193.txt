QUADRA
MARGINAL
VIDEO
WE
ARE
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WITH
A
QUADRA
THAT
HAS
STUMPED
A
COUPLE
OF
TECHS
SENT
TO
US
BY
THE
VENDOR
AS
WELL
AS
US
THIS
QUADRA
IS
STUFFED
WITH
RAM
VRAM
AND
SOME
LARGE
DISK
I
THINK
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
AFTER
A
CERTAIN
VARIABLE
INTERVAL
OF
TIME
THE
VIDEO
CIRCUITRY
LOSES
VERTICAL
SYNC
IT
IS
QUITE
APPARENT
THAT
THE
MAC
CPU
IS
STILL
OK
AND
THE
PROBLEM
REALLY
SEEMS
TO
LIE
WITH
THE
VIDEO
CIRCUITRY
SINCE
YOU
CAN
STILL
SAVE
YOUR
DOCUMENTS
QUIT
YOUR
APLPICATIONS
EVEN
PULL
DOWN
MENUS
ETC
ONLY
THE
DISPLAY
IS
SCROLLING
LIK
CRAZY
SO
ITS
PRETTY
HARD
TO
HIT
MENU
ITEMS
WE
HAD
THE
ORIGINAL
LOGIC
BOARD
REPLACED
TWICE
NOW
AND
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
HAS
BEEN
OCCURRING
ON
ALL
BOARDS
ALTHOUGH
THE
INTEVAL
BETWEEN
OCCURRENCES
HAS
VARIED
THE
FIRST
BOARD
HAD
THIS
PROBLEM
EVERY
ABOUT
MORE
OFTEN
IF
THE
CACHE
WAS
TURNED
OFF
YES
OFF
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
SYMPTOM
THAT
IS
NOT
OBVIOUSLY
RELATED
TO
THE
VIDEO
CIRCUITRY
AFTER
ALL
THE
CACHE
IS
ON
THE
CPU
RIGHT
THE
SECOND
BOARD
HAD
THE
PROBLEM
EVERY
ABOUT
MINUTES
WE
DID
NOT
KEEP
IT
RATHER
WE
PUT
THE
ORIGINAL
BACK
THE
CURRENT
BOARD
WE
HAVE
HAS
THIS
PROBLEM
A
LOT
LESS
OFTEN
HAS
GONE
ABOUT
A
WEEK
WITHOUT
DOING
IT
BUT
DID
IT
TWICE
WITHIN
AN
HOUR
YESTERDAY
THE
TECHNICIANS
THAT
HAVE
COME
OUT
TO
TRY
TO
FIGURE
IT
OUT
SEEMED
PRETTY
SHARP
AND
TRIED
A
NUMBER
OF
SENSIBLE
THINGS
MOST
OF
WHICH
WE
HAD
PREVIOUSLY
TRIED
OURSELVES
ANYWAY
THESE
INCLUDED
SWAPPING
THE
RAM
SWAPPING
THE
VRAM
SWAPPING
MONITORS
DIFFERENT
APPLE
RGB
AND
APPLE
RGB
SWAPPING
CABLES
DISCONNECTING
HD
AND
BOOTING
FROM
FLOPPY
SACRIFICING
VARIOUS
SMALL
MAMMALS
HERE
ARE
SOME
OTHER
FACTS
WHEN
WE
PUT
A
RASTEROPS
PROCOLOR
ON
THE
NUBUS
THE
PROBLEM
IS
FIXED
IT
DOES
NOT
OCCUR
WITH
THE
INTERNAL
VIDEO
OR
THE
PROCOLOR
VIDEO
OUT
THE
VENDOR
CANNOT
REPRODUCE
THE
PROBLEM
BACK
IN
THEIR
SHOP
ON
THE
BOARDS
THAT
EXHIBIT
IT
IN
OUR
LAB
APPLE
IS
SAID
TO
BE
GETTING
A
LITTLE
BIT
PISSED
OFF
AT
SHIPPING
US
BOARDS
THAT
THEY
CANNOT
FIND
ANYTHING
WRONG
WITH
AND
GETTING
THEM
SHIPPED
BACK
AS
FAULTY
ACCORDING
TO
US
HERE
ARE
SOME
SPECULATIONS
I
BET
THAT
NEITHER
APPLE
NOR
THE
VENDOR
HAS
TESTED
THESE
BOARDS
WITH
THAT
MUCH
RAM
AND
VRAM
ON
THEM
SIMULTANEAOUSLY
WHICH
MAY
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THEIR
FINDING
IT
HARD
TO
REPRODUCE
THE
PROBLEM
THOUGH
WE
CAN
REPRODUCE
IT
WITH
JUST
OF
RAM
SO
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
A
RED
HERRING
THE
VENDORS
REPRESENTATIVE
BLAMES
METAL
IN
YOUR
WALLS
CLAIMS
THAT
OUR
WALLS
HAVE
METAL
IN
THEM
WHICH
INTERFERES
WITH
THE
MACS
OPERATION
WE
HAVE
ANOTHER
IN
THE
LAB
WHICH
WORKS
LIKE
A
CHARM
THOUGH
ITS
NOT
IN
THE
EXACT
SAME
SPOT
PLEASE
DONT
TELL
ME
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
IT
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
BELIEVE
IT
ITS
PROBABLY
NOT
POLTERGEISTS
SINCE
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
BADGES
TO
GET
PAST
SECURITY
AT
THE
ENTRANCE
TO
OUR
SITE
HAS
ANYONE
ANY
IDEAS
PLEASE
PLEASE
EMAIL
AS
WELL
AS
POSTING
CAUSE
I
SEEM
TO
BE
SPENDING
A
LOT
OF
TIME
REBOOTING
MY
MAC
LATELY
AND
HAVE
A
LOT
LESS
TIME
