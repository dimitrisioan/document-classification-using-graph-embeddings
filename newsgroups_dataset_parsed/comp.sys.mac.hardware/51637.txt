i
like
it
a
lot
it
is
worth
the
additional
expense
the
only
problem
i
found
is
with
ms
word
if
you
have
a
table
the
is
longer
than
a
page
and
the
cells
have
a
visible
border
the
last
bottom
of
page
line
on
the
first
page
will
be
missing
it
makes
no
difference
how
the
table
is
formatted
the
worst
is
that
it
doesnt
show
up
in
words
page
view
or
page
preview
