KEYBOARDCENTRIS
FIX
HI
TERRY
ITS
ME
AGAIN
I
COULDNT
AGREE
WITH
YOU
MORE
I
FINALLY
RECEIVED
MY
DATADESK
KEYBOARD
A
MONTH
AFTER
SENDNG
IT
TO
DATADESK
TO
HAVE
IT
CHECKED
THEY
DIDNT
TELL
ME
OVER
THE
PHONE
THAT
YOU
HAD
TO
WAIT
BEFORE
PRESSING
THE
SHIFT
KEY
TO
DISABLE
EXTENSIONS
ACTUALLY
THEY
DID
BUT
NOT
UNTIL
A
DAY
BEFORE
MY
KEYBOARD
ARRIVED
BUT
A
MONTH
EARLIER
THEY
WERE
OF
NO
HELP
AT
ALL
I
REALLY
THINK
THEY
NEED
TO
PUT
A
DISCLAIMER
ON
THEIR
KEYBOARD
MANUAL
DAVID
