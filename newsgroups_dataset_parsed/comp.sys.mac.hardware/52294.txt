BUILDING
A
SIMPLE
APPLETALK
REPEATER
I
HAVE
A
SMALL
NETWORK
RUNNING
IN
MY
DORM
AT
SCHOOL
AND
I
AM
KIND
OF
WORRIED
ABOUT
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
WIRES
AND
THE
WAY
THAT
I
HAVE
RUN
IT
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
MIGHT
HAVE
SOME
SCHEMATIC
OR
AT
LEAST
SOME
IDEAS
ON
HOW
TO
MAKE
SOME
SORT
OF
SIMPLE
APPLETALK
REPEATER
IM
NOT
SO
INTERESTED
IN
MAKING
ACTUAL
ZONES
AND
ZONE
NAMES
JUST
A
WAY
TO
ISOLATE
DIFFERENT
BRANCHES
OF
THE
NETWORK
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEAS
ON
WHAT
COULD
BE
DONE
