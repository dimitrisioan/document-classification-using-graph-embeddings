WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
I
WANT
A
DOUBLESPIN
CDROM
DRIVE
BY
MAY
LOOKING
INTO
NEC
AND
APPLE
DOUBLESPINS
ONLY
WHAT
IS
THE
BEST
NEC
TOSHIBA
AND
SONY
APPLE
NEARLY
DELIVER
THE
SAME
SPEED
AS
APPLES
PRICES
ARE
VERY
LOW
COMPARED
TO
THERE
RAM
SIMMS
YOU
SHOULD
BUY
WHAT
IS
INEXPENCIVE
BUT
THINK
OF
DRIVER
REVISIONS
IT
IS
EASIER
TO
GET
DRIVER
KITS
FROM
APPLE
THAN
FROM
EVERY
OTHER
MANUFACTURER

I
THOUGHT
NEC
AND
TOSHIBA
CDROM
MECHANISM
HAVE
AN
AVERAGE
ACCESS
TIME
OF
LESS
THAN
MS
WHILE
THE
SONYAPPLE
CDROM
DRIVE
HAS
AN
ACCESS
TIME
OF
MS
FOR
THE
DOUBLESPIN
MODELS
CHUNG
YANG
THE
TOSHIBA
HAS
A
ACCESS
TIME
THE
NEC
HAS
A
ACCESS
TIME
RIGHT
AROUND
THE
SONYAPPLE
ACCESS
TIME
IS
OF
COURSE
SOMEWHAT
IMPORTANT
BUT
NOT
AS
VITAL
IN
THE
CASE
OF
CDS
AS
DATA
TRANSFER
RATE
ALL
THE
DRIVES
ARE
DOUBLESPEED
DRIVES
WITH
MAXIMUM
DATA
TRANSFER
RATES
OF
ANY
IS
A
GOOD
CHOICE
APPLES
IS
VERY
CHEAP
WHEN
INCLUDED
WITH
NEW
MACS
AND
I
AGREE
WITH
CHRISTIANS
COMMENT
ABOUT
DRIVERS
PLUS
APPLES
IS
BOOTABLE
ON
THE
CENTRIS
AND
QUADRA
A
VERY
NICE
FEATURE
IF
YOU
NEED
TO
INSTALL
SYSTEM
SOFTWARE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THE
NEC
OR
TOSHIBA
ARE
BOOTABLE
ON
THOSE
MACHINES
