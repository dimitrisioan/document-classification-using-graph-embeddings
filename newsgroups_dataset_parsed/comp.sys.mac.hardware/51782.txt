MO
DRIVER
COMPATIBILITY
ITS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
WHEN
YOU
FORMAT
A
MAGNETOOPTICAL
DISC
THE
FORMATTING
SOFTWARE
INSTALLS
A
DRIVER
ON
THE
DISC
IF
YOU
INSERT
THE
DISC
IN
A
DIFFERENT
DRIVE
THEN
THIS
DRIVER
IS
LOADED
INTO
THE
COMPUTERS
MEMORY
AND
THEN
CONTROLS
THE
DRIVE
AND
IF
THIS
DRIVER
IS
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
THE
DRIVE
THEN
THE
DISC
CAN
NOT
BE
MOUNTED
ANDOR
PROPERLY
READWRITTEN
IS
THAT
CORRECT
