RE
MONITOR
FOR
LCIII
JEFF
I
HAVE
ANSWERS
TO
BOTH
OF
YOUR
QUESTIONS
FIRST
I
RECOMMEND
THE
SONY
MONITOR
IT
IS
A
TRINITRON
VGA
MONITOR
BUT
IT
IS
DESIGNED
SPECIFICALLY
FOR
USE
WITH
THE
LC
IT
WORKS
ONLY
WITH
MACS
WITH
SPECIFIC
VIDEO
CAPABILITIES
WHICH
MEANS
ONLY
THE
LCS
AND
ANYTHING
AFTER
THE
CI
ALL
IT
TAKES
IS
A
MACVGA
CABLE
I
RECOMMEND
ONE
FROM
JAMES
ENGINEERING
WHICH
IS
ABOUT
THESE
COST
ABOUT
AS
COMPARED
TO
THE
MUCH
HIGHER
PRICES
OF
COMPARABLE
MONITORS
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
MULTISYNCH
I
HAVE
USED
ONE
FOR
HALF
A
YEAR
AND
I
LOVE
IT
SECOND
I
HAVE
USED
SYEX
AND
FOUND
THEM
TO
BE
DECENT
I
HAD
A
BACKORDER
ON
A
SUPRA
MODEM
WHICH
I
CANCELLED
THEY
WERE
HELPFUL
IN
EXPLAINING
THE
REASONS
WHY
THERE
WERE
DELAYS
AND
THEY
HAD
SUPRAS
NUMBER
READY
FOR
ME
THE
ONLY
COMPLAINT
WAS
THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
ALWAYS
RETURN
MY
CALLS
I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THE
IS
SELLING
FOR
FROM
JRS
I
THINK
SYEX
IS
A
LITTLE
MORE
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
DAVID
FROM
PLANET
BMUG
THE
FIRSTCLASS
BBS
OF
BMUG
THE
MESSAGE
CONTAINED
IN
THIS
POSTING
DOES
NOT
IN
ANY
WAY
REFLECT
