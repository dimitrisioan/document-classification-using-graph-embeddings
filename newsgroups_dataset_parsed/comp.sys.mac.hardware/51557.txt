WRITES
IM
IN
THE
MARKET
FOR
A
POSTSCRIPT
COMPATIBLE
LASER
WRITER
MY
NEEDS
ARE
PRETTY
MODEST
SO
DPI
PAGES
A
MINUTE
WOULD
BE
JUST
FINE
MY
BUDGET
IS
ALSO
PRETTY
MODEST
SO
INEXPENSIVE
WOULD
ALSO
BE
GOOD
IT
WILL
BE
WORKING
FROM
A
SINGLE
MAC
BUT
NETWORKABILITY
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
A
GOOD
INVESTMENT
FOR
THE
FUTURE
WITH
THAT
IN
MIND
ANYONE
HAVE
COMMENTS
ABOUT
THE
SUITABILITYQUALITYVALUE
OF
A
GCC
BLP
ELITE
PRINTER
I
JUST
RECENTLY
PURCHASED
THE
GCC
BLP
ELITE
AND
I
REALLY
LIKE
IT
MY
NEEDS
ARE
MUCH
THE
SAME
AS
WHAT
YOU
DESCRIBE
IN
ADDITION
I
WANTED
TO
GET
ONE
THAT
I
COULD
ACCESS
VIA
APPLETALK
SO
THAT
ELIMINATED
THE
NEW
LINE
OF
INEXPENSIVE
PRINTERS
FROM
APPLE
THE
PRINT
QUALITY
IS
GOOD
TO
EXCELLENT
BASED
ON
WHAT
FONT
YOURE
USING
AND
WHAT
PAPER
YOU
USE
IM
STILL
EXPERIMENTING
WITH
DIFFERENT
PAPERS
BUT
A
MEDIUM
GRADE
LASER
PRINTER
PAPER
SEEMS
TO
WORK
FINE
PRINTING
ENVELOPES
TRANSPARIENCIES
LETTER

OR
OTHER

JOBS
IS
VERY
EASY
THERE
IS
AN
ADJUSTABLE
AUTOMATIC
CENTERING
GUIDE
ON
TOP
OF
THE
SHEET
FEEDER
WHICH
ALIGNS
THE
PAPER
PROPERLY
AND
DOESNT
FEED
A

FROM
THE
