dying
i
bought
a
stylewriter
ii
a
couple
months
ago
and
lately
when
i
print
something
i
notice
white
lines
or
gaps
running
through
the
line
being
printed
its
almost
like
the
paper
is
advancing
a
smidge
too
far
when
advancing
lines
i
replaced
the
ink
cartridge
thinking
it
might
be
the
problem
but
the
lines
are
still
there
has
anyone
else
noticed
this
problem
whats
the
best
way
to
get
rid
of
it
