DYING
I
BOUGHT
A
STYLEWRITER
II
A
COUPLE
MONTHS
AGO
AND
LATELY
WHEN
I
PRINT
SOMETHING
I
NOTICE

GAPS
RUNNING

PRINTED
ITS
ALMOST

THE

IS
ADVANCING
A
SMIDGE
TOO

WHEN
ADVANCING
LINES
I
REPLACED
THE
INK
CARTRIDGE
THINKING
IT
MIGHT
BE
THE
PROBLEM
BUT

LINES
ARE
STILL
THERE
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
NOTICED
THIS
PROBLEM
WHATS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
GET
RID
OF
IT
