my
advisor
has
decided
to
get
a
mac
for
the
lab
now
that
we
are
funded
again
the
consensus
in
the
lab
was
that
all
we
really
needed
was
an
lciii
but
he
decided
he
wanted
a
centris
the
lack
of
an
fpu
on
that
machine
and
the
price
struck
me
as
making
it
worth
less
than
an
lciii
so
i
have
suggested
we
get
a
iivx
instead
it
seems
heavily
expandable
and
for
what
do
people
with
iivxs
think
of
them
they
seem
like
good
machines
to
me
and
i
like
the
nubus
slots
in
case
we
ultimately
decide
we
want
to
do
work
with
video
on
it
the
iivxlciii
performance
at
a
centris
price
the
only
reason
to
get
an
iivx
is
if
you
really
need
the
fullsize
nubus
slots
keep
in
mind
that
the
supports
all
apple
monitors
and
has
optional
ethernet
this
lessens
but
doesnt
eliminate
the
need
for
nubus
cards
and
unless
youre
running
fpuintensive
software
the
will
blow
the
doors
off
the
lciii
and
the
iivx
the
lciii
on
the
other
hand
is
sufficient
for
most
people
and
has
a
great
price
if
you
havent
guessed
i
find
halving
the
bus
clock
the
iivx
up
vs
bus
a
throughly
bad
thing
and
i
hope
apple
never
does
it
again
