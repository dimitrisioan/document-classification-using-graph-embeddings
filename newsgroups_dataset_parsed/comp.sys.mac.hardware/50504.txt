LCIII
TO
VGA
MONITOR
ADAPTERS
IM
HAVING
A
REAL
TOUGH
TIME
FINDING
OUT
THE
PROPER
ADAPTERS
TO
USE
A
VGA
MONITOR
AN
IBM
SOLD
W
MANY
TO
BE
EXACT
ON
THE
MAC
LC
III
ALL
OF
THE
VENDORS
I
HAVE
CALLED
SAY
THAT
THE
INTERNAL
VIDEO
WILL
NOT
WORK
ON
A
TRUE
VGA
MONITOR
BUT
WILL
WORK
ON
A
IBM
COMPATIBLE
MULTISYNC
LIKE
THE
SONYS
OR
THE
NEC
MONITORS
I
THOUGHT
THE
VGA
CAPABILITY
OF
LCIII
WAS
VERY
ATTRACTIVE
BECAUSE
IT
ALLOWED
YOU
TO
USE
INEXPENSIVE
VGA
MONITORS
AM
I
CONFUSED
OR
ARE
THESE
VENDORS
JUST
NOT
UP
TO
SPEED
HAS
ANYONE
USED
AN
LCIII
WITH
A
NON
MULTISYNC
VGA
MONITOR
AND
IF
SO
WHERE
DID
YOU
GET
YOUR
ADAPTER
PLEASE
BE
SPECIFIC
W
VENDOR
AND
CAT
I
WOULD
PREFER
TO
GET
A
APPLE
MONITOR
FOR
THESE
LCIIIS
ITS
UNSEEMLY
TO
SEE
THE
FINDER
INSIDE
AN
IBM
BEZEL
BUT
THE
MORE
MONEY
WE
SAVE
ON
MONITORS
THE
MORE
LCIIIS
WE
CAN
AFFORD
AND
THE
MORE
WE
CAN
GET
RID
