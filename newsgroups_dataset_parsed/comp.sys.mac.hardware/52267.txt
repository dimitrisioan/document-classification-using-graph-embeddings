RE
MONITORS
SHOULD
THEY
BE
KEPT
ON
HOURS
A
DAY
IVE
TURNED
MY
MONITOR
ON
AND
OFF
WITH
THE
CPU
RUNNING
MANY
TIMES
EACH
TIME
I
WONDER
WHAT
I
AM
DOING
TO
MY
CPU
BY
DIRECTLY
HOOKING
IN
SUCH
A
HIGH
CURRENT
DRAW
ON
ITS
LINES
WHILE
IT
IS
RUNNING
DOES
THIS
PUT
A
SUBSTANTIAL
SPIKE
ON
THE
POWER
LINE
COULD
ONE
POSSIBLY
LOSE
DATA
OR
DAMAGE
EQUIPMENT
