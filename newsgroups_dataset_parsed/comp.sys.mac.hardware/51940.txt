NEED
A
CARD
FOR
SONY
I
RECENTLY
MADE
THE
MISTAKE
OF
PURCHASING
A
SONY
MONITOR
FOR
MY
MAC
IICI
THE
MONITOR
IS
VERY
GOOD
HOWEVER
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
IICI
DOES
NOT
SUPPORT
VGA
THEN
WHY
DID
YOU
BUY
IT
YOU
ASK
I
AM
STUPID
I
REPLY
WHAT
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
IS
A
VIDEO
CARD
PREFERABLY
BIT
WHICH
SUPPORTS
VGA
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
ANY
INFORMATION
I
CAN
GET
OFFERS
FOR
THE
SALE
OF
APPLICABLE
CARDS
WILL
ALSO
BE
CONSIDERED
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
