need
a
card
for
sony
i
recently
made
the
mistake
of
purchasing
a
sony
monitor
for
my
mac
iici
the
monitor
is
very
good
however
it
seems
that
the
iici
does
not
support
vga
then
why
did
you
buy
it
you
ask
i
am
stupid
i
reply
what
i
am
looking
for
is
a
video
card
preferably
bit
which
supports
vga
i
am
interested
in
any
information
i
can
get
offers
for
the
sale

applicable
cards

also
be
considered
