i
believe
apple
has
a
patent
on
the
region
features
of
quickdraw
a
mac
clone
would
have
to
implement
regions
this
is
why
apples
comment
was
that
they
believe
it
is
not
possible
to
make
a
mac
clone
without
infringing
on
their
patents
they
may
have
other
patents
like
this
apple
has
patented
their
implementation
of
regions
which
presumably
includes
the
internal
data
structure
which
has
never
been
officially
documented
by
apple
apple
cannot
patent
the
concept
of
a
region
im
guessing
that
either
nutek
reverseengineered
apples
internal
data
structure
for
regions
i
dunno
if
this
would
hold
up
in
court
or
they
came
up
with
their
own
data
structure
if
its
the
latter
then
they
wont
be
able
to
draw
pict
files
containing
regions
besides
pict
files
there
arent
many
places
where
regions
are
stored
on
disk
quicktime
movies
perhaps
as
long
as
the
region
isnt
being
stored
on
disk
and
transferred
from
a
mac
to
a
nutek
clone
or
vice
versa
it
doesnt
matter
if
nutek
uses
a
completely
different
internal
data
structure
i
remember
reading
that
apple
also
has
a
patent
on
their
adb
hardware
and
that
the
nutek
clones
would
therefore
be
lacking
an
adb
port
what
other
patents
does
apple
have
on
the
mac

any
