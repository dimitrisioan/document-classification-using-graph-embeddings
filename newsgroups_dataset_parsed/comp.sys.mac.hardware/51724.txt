I
ORDERED
A
VRAM
CHIP
FOR
MY
NEW
LCIII
FROM
MAC
CONNECTION
THEY
SENT
IT
OVERNIGHT
VERY
NICE
AND
I
GOT
IT
INSTALLED
AND
WE
FOUND
THAT
IT
DIDNT
WORK
PROPERLY
WHEN
YOU
PUT
THE
COMPUTER
IN
THOUSANDS
MODE
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
SCREEN
USING
THE
NEW
CHIP
IS
ALL
FLICKERING
AND
FUZZY
SO
I
CALLED
THEM
UP
AND
IM
GOING
TO
RETURN
IT
FOR
A
NEW
ONE
MY
QUESTION

LARGE
PORTION

RARITY
