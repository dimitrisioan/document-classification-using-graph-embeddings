what
is
it
i
dont
recall
seeing
it
in
dale
adams
post
of
course
it
was
in
dales
post
just
not
in
the
words
that
macuser
used
rom
accelerated
video
just
means
that
some
quickdraw
commands
has
been
rewritten
inside
the
rom
to
take
advantage
of
the
addressing
modes
commands
that
do
fills
should
be
slightly
faster
since
the
new
instructions
fetch
