why
does
apple
give
us
a
confusing
message
in

writes
afterall
apples
literature
is
not
always
correct
a
funny
one
i
noticed
recently
is
that
some
of
the
brochures
on
the
macs
with
cd
capability
refer
to
the
auto
inkjet
feature
this
should
have
read
auto
inject
feature
as
it
does
on
some
other
correct
brochures
ive
seen
from
apple
since
it
was
correct
on
some
older
brochures
i
can
only
guess
that
someone
edited
the
copy
saw
inject
and
thought
it
was
a
typo
and
changed
it
to
the
more
familiar
word
inkjet
hmmm
what
would
that
be
a
printer
built
into
the
cd
player
a
way
of
writing
information
to
a
cd
how
do
you
think
they
get
the
cool
images
on
the
top
serface
of
cds
anyway
they
gotta
have
something
to
do
the
top
surface
artwork
