HELP
SCSI
WOES
ON
MAC
IIFX
I
AM
HAVING
TROUBLE
WITH
SCSI
ON
A
MAC
IIFX
THE
MACHINE
IS
YEARS
OLD
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
USING
THE
SAME
HARD
DRIVE
INTERNAL
MAXTOR
FOR
TWO
AND
A
HALF
YEARS
THE
DISK
RECENTLY
CRASHED
I
REFORMATTED
SILVERLINING
BUT
DURING
THE
REFORMAT
I
RECEIVED
RANDOM
WRITE
ERRORS
DURING
TESTING
THE
ERROR
MESSAGE
REPORTED
WAS
LIKE
SECTOR
WRITE
ERROR
DETECTED
AFTER
TESTING
GOOD
SECTOR
NOT
MAPPED
OUT
THIS
OCCURRED
RANDOMLY
ALL
OVER
THE
HARD
DISK
WHICH
MAKES
ME
SUSPECT
THE
DIAGNOSTICS
REFERENCE
TO
SECTOR
ON
THE
THIRD
REFORMAT
AND
AFTER
REINSTALLING
THE
SCSI
READWRITE
LOOPS
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
THROUGH
PASSES
AND
WITH
NO
ERRORS
PASS
FOR
SOME
REASON
REPORTED
A
LOT
OF
ERRORS
BUT
STILL
MAPPED
OUT
NO
SECTORS
I
DECIDED
TO
GO
AHEAD
AND
TRY
TO
RESINSTALL
SYSTEM
AND
RELOAD
MY
DATA
FROM
A
BACKUP
THIS
PROCEDED
NORMALLY
HOWEVER
I
NOW
HAVE
SUBOPTIMAL
PERFORMANCE
SYMPTOMS
INCLUDE
O
FREQUENT
CRASHES
O
INSTANCES
OF
EXTREMELY
SLUGGISH
DISK
ACCESS
REQUIRING
A
REBOOT
TO
CORRECT
O
INSTANCES
OF
NOT
FINDING
THE
DISK
ON
THE
SCSI
CHAIN
ON
REBOOT
IF
I
BOOT
FROM
NORTON
UTL
AFTER
THIS
OCCURS
IT
CANNOT
FIND
THE
DISK
EITHER
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
FIXES
THIS
IS
RECYCLING
THE
POWER
IT
SOMETIMES
REQUIRES
SEVERAL
ATTEMPTS
QUESTIONS
HAS
ANYONE
HAD
THIS
TYPE
OF
PROBLEM
BEFORE
IS
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
FX
MOTHERBOARD
AND
ITS
NONSTANDARD
SCSI
IMPLEMENTATION
OR
WITH
MY
MAXTOR
DISK
IS
THERE
SOME
DIAGNOSTIC
SOFTWARE
THAT
WOULD
HELP
ME
MAKE
THIS
DETERMINATION
IS
IT
A
TERMINATION
PROBLEM
I
CURRENTLY
HAVE
EXTERNAL
SYQUEST
AND
AN
EXTERNAL
DATAFRAME
ON
THE
CHAIN
THE
IS
AT
THE
END
AND
HAS
INTERNAL
TERMINATION
SO
I
AM
NOT
USING
THE
IIFX
TERMINATOR
I
DO
HAVE
THE
SCSI
FILTER
INSTALLED
ON
THE
INTERNAL
DRIVE
I
HAVE
RUN
WITH
THIS
EXACT
STEUP
FOR
YEARS
WITH
ONE
PREVIOUS
DISK
CRASH
REQUIRING
A
REFORMAT
ABOUT
A
YEAR
AGO
I
ALSO
HAVE
SYMPTOMS
IF
I
DISCONNECT
THE
EXTERNAL
DEVICES
SO
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
SCSI
TERMINATION
WOULD
NOW
BE
AN
ISSUE
OF
COURSE
WHO
KNOWS
HELP
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
FORREST
