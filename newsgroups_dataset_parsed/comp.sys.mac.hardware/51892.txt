sorry
about
the

but
the

here
does
not
let
one
easily
change
the

and
i
gave

after
a

this

is
also
available

on

in
the

as

the
reason
for
this
general
data
sheet
is
to
consolidate
and
condense
the
information
out
there
so
that
people
in
both
camps
can
be
clear
and
accurate
about
what
they
are
saying
about
their
machines
since
computer
technology
is
always
changing
there
are
always
going
to
be
points
in
which
the
sheet
will
be
lacking
or
incorrect
on
information
so
please
just
dont
say
the
sheet
is
incomplete
or
incorrect
but
also
give
me
clear
and
concise
information
to
make
the
needed
corrections
all
prices
are
in
us
dollars
to
keep
this
data
sheet
organized
please
provide
if
possible
article
citations
for
the
information
provided
or
corrected
and
keep
the
opinions
to
a
minimum
as
this
is
a
general
data
sheet
keep
the
info
provided
simple
so
i
can
understand
what
is
being
talked
about
and
can
explain
it
to
others
finally
keep
the
information
relevant
to
the
section
corrected
for
example
os
code
in
rom
is
software
contained
in

so
no
more

it

as

motorola

are
faster

but
intel
has
chips
at
higher
frequencies
than
motorola
so
this
evens

the

the
limit
on

brings
it
down
to

lower
chips
otherwise
it
would
compare
to
the
hardware
segmenting
vs
alu
and
these
chips
come
have
no
usable
builtin
mmu
unlike
their
successors
the

of

put
the

the
only

if
