hi
i
own
an
lciii
and
i
recently
heard
an
interesting
rumor
i
heard
that
the
lciii
has
a
built
in
slot
for
a
powerpc
chip
is
this
true
i
heard
that
the
slot
is
not
the
same
as
the
pds
slot
is
that
true
thanks
david

mirskygnuaimitedu
well
i
also
have
an
lc
iii
popping
the
top
revealed
one
socket
for
an
additional
vram
simm
one
socket
for
a
ram
simm
one
socket
for
a
flatpack
fpu
a
processordirect
slot
pds
identical
to
the
lclc
ii
but
with
an
additional
set
of
connetions
to
one
side
for
the
full
data
path
that
the
lclc
ii
lacked
thats
it
i
guess
a
board
with
a
powerpc
chip
could
be
made
that
would
fit
in
the
pds
but
thats
the
only
place
so
will
it
be
possible
to
have
a
nubus
or
pds
powerpc
upgrade
or
will
it
require
a
logic
board
swap
it
would
be
interesting
for
apple
to
come
out
with
a
nubus
powerpc
that
allowed
use
of
the
cpus
like
rocketshare
but
i
guess
thats
getting
a
bit
fantastic
i
was
wondering
since
macweek
reported
that
developers
were
seeded
with
powerpcs
on
a
nubus
card
also
any
word
on
machine
arrivals
or
estimated
speed
last
i
heard
the
estimates
were
around
times
the
speed
of
a
quadra
in
native
risc
mode
i
heard
an
apple
employee
mumble
something
about
the
arrival
of
powerpc
machines
at
a
much
earlier
date
that
but
i
doubt
its
true
finally
is
the
powerpc
developers
cd
minicourse
available
i
saw
it
advertised
in
the
developers
university
calendar
and
id
like
to
know
if
its
at
all
interesting
sean
seanmcdacdalca
radius
speculated
publicly
that
they
could
provide
a
powerpcbased
rocket
for
existing
macs
it
would
have
the
plus
of
rocketshare
and
the
minus
of
nubus
accelerators
no
true
boot
off
the
accelerator
nubus
bottleneck
to
video
and
other
io
apple
it
seems
will
not
compete
with
third
parties
here
except
perhaps
for
notyetavailable
macs
like
cyclone
where
a
powerpc
slot
might
be
advertised
look
for
daystar
and
such
to
make
powerpc
accelerators
one
potential
problem
with
any
accelerator
though
is
that
it
will
need
a
rom
companion
and
apple
has
licensed
only
radius
with
rocketshare
to
use
any
of
its
proprietary
code
apple
is
between
the
lines
trying
to
let
us
know
that
powerpc
macs
will
have
simplified
logic
boards
due
to
the
magical
nature
of
risc
and
that
these
boards
should
be
much
cheaper
to
build
than
those
in
existing
macs
perhaps
then
well
see
groundbreaking
prices
in
maclogic
board
upgrades
much
the
same
way
weve
seen
much
cheaper
highperformance
cpus
this
year
first
generation
powerpcs
will
also
hopefully
have
socketed
cpus
so
that
theyll
be
chip
upgradeable
to
a
year
later
this
should
be
possible
in
much
the
same
way
that
can
be
pulled
for
clock
doublers
if
there
is
too
much
technical
baggage
which
i
doubt
since
the
external
busses
are
the
same
sizewidth
to
do
this
perhaps
we
can
have
cpu
daughterboard
a
la
powerbook
as
standard
to
facilitate
better
cpu
upgrades
this
is
an
area
where
apple
has
fallen
far
behing
the
intelbased
world
perhaps
catchup
is
in
order
by
the
way
last
weeks
pc
week
had
an
excellent
story
on
powerpc
pentium
mips
dec
alpha
the
big
four
on
the
microprocessor
front
for
the
forseeable
future
worth
reading
for
technojunkies
also
the
latest
pc
has
a
cover
story
on
pentium
read
it
and
all
the
other
stories
about
how
intel
is
unstoppable
and
preeminent
right
now
once
anyone
is
this
secure
they
are
due
to
fall
intels
market
position
will
never
again
be
as
dominant
as
it
is
today
especially
if
amd
gets
the
go
ahead
to
sell
its
this
week
as
it
appears
it
might
the
competition
from
all
fronts
is
gearing
up
for
an
awesome
battle
apple
users
should
be
excited
that
powerpc
while
not
guaranteed
dominance
is
a
guaranteed
winner
even
if
its
one
of
several
mark
