if
you
get
teh
iivx
upgrade
does
it
include
a
new
sticker
to
cover
the
iivx
identifier
with
a

indetifier
i
cant
say
for
sure
with
the
iivx
upgrade
but
i
wondered
the
same
thing
when
i
ordered
my
lc
lc
iii
upgrade
turns
out
the
upgrade
is
actually
an
entire
cpu
minus
any
disk
drives
you
pull
the
floppy
and
hard
drives
out
of
the
old
one
stick
them
in
the
new
one
and
youve
got
an
lc
iii
the
iivx
may
be
the
same
thing
it
might
be
something
to
look
into
for
those
people
who
are
unhappy
that
apple
only
sells
macs
prepackaged
with
the
drives
of
course
the
price
is
quite
a
bit
higher
without
the
tradein
