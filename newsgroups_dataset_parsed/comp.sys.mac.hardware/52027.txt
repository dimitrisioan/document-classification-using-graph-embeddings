you

i

geeze
actually
the
is
for
the

not
the
universal

the
mhz
universal
powercache
with
fpu
and
adaptor
can
be
had
for
about
still
not
a
bad
deal
i
believe
the
powercard
is
one
generation
older
than
the
universal
powercache
and
the
one
primary
difference
is
that
the
powercard
is
machine
specific
while
the
powercache
can
fit
into
many
macs
with
the
proper
adaptor
both
cards
are
based
im
not
sure
if
the
hardware
or
software
with
the
powercard
is
otherwise
different
from
the
powercache
perhaps
someone
could
enlighten
me
i
would
also
add
that
i
called

other
night
and
these
powercards
were
going
