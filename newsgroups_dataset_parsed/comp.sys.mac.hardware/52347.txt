those
chimes
indicate
a
hardware
failure
of
some
type
during
system
startup
one
thing
that
can
cause
the
chimes
is
a
cable
that
has
become
a
bit
loose
next
time
you
power
down
the
computer
check
that
all
cables
are
on
tight
i
remember
a
simple
program
that
would
play
those
chimes
for
you
when
you
clicked
their
respective
buttons
does
anyone
know
where
that
is
this
was
circa
i
think
a
quick
search
of
the
index
at
macarchiveumichedu
shows
the
following
as
available
by
anonymous
ftp
from
that
site
macutildeveloperdiagnosticsoundsamplerhqx
that
chord
you
hear
when
you
push
the
startup
on
your
mac
ii
means
more
than
just
im
on
its
passed
its
internal
test
this
utility
explains
what
the
various
sounds
stand
for
ie
various
stages
of
ram
testing
