RE
MONITORS
SHOULD
THEY
BE
KEPT
ON
HOURS
A
DAY
I
WONDER
HOW
HARD
IT
WOULD
BE
IE
WHAT
IT
WOULD
ADD
TO
THE
COST
TO
DESIGN
DESKTOP
MACHINES
WITH
A
POWER
SAVER
FEATURE
BUILT
IN
WHICH
WOULD
REDUCE
POWER
CONSUMPTION
AUTOMATICALLY
IF
THE
MACHINE
IS
IDLE
FOR
MORE
THAN
SOME
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
I
BELIEVE
THAT
APPLE
SUN
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
DESKTOP
MACHINE
MANUFACTURERS
HAVE
AGREED
WITH
THE
GOVERNMENT
TO
INCORPORATE
POWERSAVING
TECHNIQUES
THIS
IS
ALSO
SOMETHING
THAT
GOVERNMENTS
IN
OTHER
COUNTRIES
ARE
LIKELY
TO
REQUIRE
IN
THE
FUTURE
SO
EXPECT
TO
SEE
IT
THIS
MAY
INCLUDE
THE
ABILITY
FOR
THE
SYSTEM
TO
FULLY
POWER
DOWN
THE
MONITOR
VIA
A
CONTROLLABLE
POWER
OUTLET
AND
POWER
IT
BACK
ON
AUTOMATICALLY
IS
THIS
A
SELL
ON
SCREEN
SAVER
SOFTWARE
COMPANIES
GOALS
FOR
IDLE
POWER
CONSUMPTION
HAVE
BEEN
SET
AT
SOMETHING
LIKE
WATTS
FOR
THE
SYSTEM
NOT
INCLUDING
THE
MONITOR
DONT
QUOTE
ME
ON
THIS
NOTE
THAT
IN
MANY
BUSINESSES
THE
SAVINGS
WILL
BE
SUBSTANTIAL
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
FACTOR
IN
REDUCED
LOAD
ON
AIR
CONDITIONING
SYSTEMS
SUN
DID
A
STUDY
THAT
INDICATED
THAT
SIMPLY
POWERING
OFF
MONITORS
FOR
THE
NIGHT
WOULD
SAVE
THE
COMPANY
SUN
ITSELF
ON
THE
ORDER
OF
PER
YEAR
PUTTING
OTHER
AND
AUTOMATIC
POWERSAVING
FEATURES
IN
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
GREATER
THAN
DOUBLE
THAT
VALUE
GIVEN
THAT
WE
ARE
SEEING
MORE
AND
MORE
REASON
TO
LEAVE
OUR
WORK
AND
HOME
COMPUTERS
ON
GETTING
FAXES
AUTOMATICALLY
GETTING
EMAIL
BUILDING
POWER
CONSUMPTION
CONTROL
INTO
ALL
MACHINES
HAS
A
POTENTIAL
TO
CUT
OFF
THE
NATIONAL
POWER
CONSUMPTION
BASED
ON
DATA
I
HEARD
BTW
WHEN
ENCOURAGING
EMPLOYEES
TO
POWER
OFF
MONITORS
WHEN
LEAVING
WORK
IT
WAS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THIS
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
DONE
WITH
MONITORS
WITH
THE
POWER
SWITCH
ON
FRONT
THERE
WAS
SOME
INDICATION
THAT
MONITORS
WITH
POWER
SWITCHES
ON
THE
REAR
ARE
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
TOLERATE
LOTS
OF
POWER
CYCLING
THIS
MAY
ONLY
APPLY
TO
THE
MONITORS
WE
USE
BUT
MIGHT
BE
WORTH
CHECKING
IF
YOU
HAPPEN
TO
HAVE
A
MONITOR
WITH
THE
SWITCH
IN
BACK
