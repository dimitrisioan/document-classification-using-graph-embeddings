i
cannot
speak
for
dale
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
macintosh
uses
the
full
or
data
path
to
its
full
advantage
that
is
it
is
running
as
fast
with
two
or
four
simms
as
it
would
with
one
simm
now
it
may
be
that
longword
accesses
assuming
a
data
path
here
get
the
first
byte
from
the
first
simm
the
second
byte
from
the
second
and
so
on
this
would
mean
that
each
longword
of
memory
is
actually
split
among
four
simms
one
for
each
byte
on
the
other
hand
it
could
be
that
the
simms
are
interleaved
by
word
or
longword
not
just
by
byte
or
they
could
be
successive
in
memory
and
the
memory
controller
deals
with
the
eightbit
data
path
that
each
one
has
i
suspect
though
that
they
are
interleaved
to
some
extent
so
that
bits
can
be
read
or
written
at
once
this
would
indicate
a
bytelevel
interleave
i
am
not
confusing
this
with
the
new
machines
longword
interleave
with
two
simms
of
the
same
sort
although
that
seems
to
be
the
same
sort
of
idea
there
you
get
an
essential
data
path
ro
excuse
me
to
ram
instead
of
just
a
one
yes
the
cpu
cant
handle
it
but
when
writing
to
successive
addresses
it
speeds
something
up
so
dale
am
i
right
simms
are
interleaved
by
bytes
allowing
the
full
data
bus
or
as
is
common
with
usenet
and
me
in
particular
am
i
as
clueless
as
everyone
else
what
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
this
im
trying
to
figure
out
what
kind
of
memory
configuration
for
the
lc
iii
datapath
would
be
fastest
any
ideas
