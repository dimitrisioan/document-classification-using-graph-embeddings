does
anyone
know
how
to
open
up
the
apple
ergomouse
adb
mouse
ii
mine
lives
near
a
cat
true
really
and
picks
up
her
fur
from
what
i
can
tell
it
looks
like
apple
welded
it
shut
you
must
not
have
tried
very
hard
i
just
opend
mine
in
about
seconds
take
a
look
on
the
bottom
it
has
a
dial
that
turns
to
open
much
like
the
older
adb
mouses
used
to
have
its
a
bit
harder
to
turn
at
first
but
it
is
quite
simple
to
open
also
does
anyone
know
about
installing
fpus
in
a
mac
lc
iii
ive
heard
some
people
saying
it
has
fried
the
motherboard
of
the
lc
iii
well
if
you
dont
match
up
the
pins
correctly
you
will
have
some
problems
a
close
look
at
the
socket
should
give
you
an
idea
of
the
proper
orientation
of
the
chip
hades
