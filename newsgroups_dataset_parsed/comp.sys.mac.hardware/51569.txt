I
SAID
I
KNOW
THAT
PLUGGING
AND
UNPLUGGING
ADB
DEVICES
WITH
THE
POWER
ON
IS
NOT
SUPPORTED
AND
YOU
CAN
HIT
PROBLEMS
IF
YOU
HAVE
MULTIPLE
DEVICES
WITH
CLASHING
ADDRESSES
AND
ALL
THAT
IVE
HAD
A
COUPLE
OF
EMAIL
RESPONSES
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
SEEM
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
IS
NOT
ONLY
UNSUPPORTED
IT
IS
DOWNRIGHT
DANGEROUS
I
HAVE
HEARD
OF
NO
SUCH
WARNINGS
FROM
ANYBODY
AT
APPLE
JUST
TO
BE
SURE
I
ASKED
A
COUPLE
OF
OUR
TECHNICIANS
ONE
OF
WHOM
HAS
BEEN
SERVICING
MACS
FOR
YEARS
THERE
IS
NO
DANGER
OF
DAMAGING
LOGIC
BOARDS
BY
PLUGGING
AND
UNPLUGGING
ADB
DEVICES
WITH
THE
POWER
ON
NOOOOOOOO
IVE
BEEN
SERVICING
MACS
FOR
YEARS
TOO
AND
IVE
HAD
TO
REPAIR
A
NUMBER
OF
MOTHERBOARDS
THAT
HAD
BEEN
DAMAGED
THIS
WAY
ITS
RARE
BUT
IT
DOES
HAPPEN
MIND
YOU
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
YOU
SHOULDNT
DO
IT
THE
PARTS
THAT
CAN
BLOW
THE
ADB
POWER
FUSE
AND
RF
FILTER
ARENT
TOO
EXPENSIVE
SO
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
SOMEONE
AROUND
WHO
CAN
DO
COMPONENTLEVEL
REPAIR
IT
MAY
BE
WORTH
THE
RISK
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOURE
AROUND
SEATTLE
CAUSE
YOU
MIGHT
GET
TO
PAY
ME
TO
FIX
IT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
YOUR
ONLY
REPAIR
OPTION
IS
THE
APPLESTANDARD
LOGIC

SHOULD
PROBABLY
PLAY
