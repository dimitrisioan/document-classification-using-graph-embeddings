re
your
opinion
of
the
laserwriter

johnc
says
this
model
is
one
of
the
two
lowcost
laser
printers
that
apple
just
introduced
im
thinking
of
getting
one
to
use
at
home
have
any
of
you

printer

il
frankly
i
think
this
model
is
a
screwup
it
does
not
have
postscriptlevel
only
has
fonts
and
does
not
even
have
fine
print
or
photograde
or
grayshare
even
the
model
has
this
i
am
shocked
by
the
kind
of
features
you
get
for
this
printer
i
myself
was
hoping
for
some
decent
printer
to
replace
the
personal
laser
writers
