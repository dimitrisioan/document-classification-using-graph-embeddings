IBM

ITS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
HAVE
A
HORIZONTALLY
FORMATTED
HARD
DISK
IN
A
VERTICAL
POSITION
IF
THE
DRIVE
IS
FORMATTED
IN
A
HORIZONTAL
POSITION
IT
CAN
NOT
COMPLETELY
COMPENSATE
FOR
THE
GRAVITATIONAL
PULL
IN
A
VERTICAL
POSITION
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
YOUR
HARD
DISK
WILL
FAIL
TOMORROW
OR
MONTHS
FROM
NOW
BUT
WHY
TAKE
THAT
CHANCE
IF
YOU
WANT
MORE
DETAILED
INFO
ON
THE
PROBLEM
