the
mac
ii
is
supposed
to
have
a
socket
for
the
pmmu
chip
could
anyone
let
me
know
where
that
socket
is
on
the
motherboard
i
have
obtained
a
pmmu
chip
mhz
from
a
surplus
store
and
would
like
to
install
it
onto
my
mac
ii
circa
but
i
cannot
see
the
socket
myself
when
i
tried
to
install
it
the
original
mac
ii
had
an
apple
mmu
chip
installed
which
performs
a
subset
of
the
functions
if
you
look
underneath
your
front
left
floppy
bay
you
will
find
three
chips
all
approximately
the
same
size
one
will
be
the
the
next
the
and
the
third
approximately
the
same
size
will
be
the
apple
chip
it
is
easy
to
spot
because
it
has
a
hump
in
the
middle
of
it
example
that
and
the
apple
logo
should
make
it
easy
to
find
