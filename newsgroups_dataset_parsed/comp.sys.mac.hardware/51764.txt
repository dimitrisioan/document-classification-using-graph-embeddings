besides

performance
youd
need
a
cache
anyway
i
mean
who
uses
a
processor
that
runs
at
the
speed
of
simms
note
that
this
memory
speed
corresponds

how
do
you
calculate
that
figure
id
assume
even
in
personal
computers
the
board
designers
would
use
bank
switching
to
optimistically
quadruple
the
access
speed
or
am
i
missing
something
here
the
previous
article
referred
to
the
fact
that
you
could
only
use
simms
in
a
machine
but
that
you
could
use
simms
in
slower
machines
i
just
pointed
out
that
if
you
could
only
use
simms
in
a
machine
you
cant
use
simms
in
anything
faster
than
a
mhz
machine
bank
switching
and
caches
were
not
considered
in
either
example
although
both
would
help
memory
access
