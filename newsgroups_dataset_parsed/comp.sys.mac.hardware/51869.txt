RE
HOW
DO
THEY
COMPARE
THE
REAL
QUESTION
HERE
IN
MY
OPINION
IS
WHAT
MOTOROLA
PROCESSORS
RUNNING
SYSTEM
ON
A
MAC
ARE
COMPARABLE
TO
WHAT
INTEL
PROCESSORS
RUNNING
WINDOWS
ON
A
PC
I
RECALL
THERE
BEING
A
CONVERSATION
HERE
THAT
A
RUNNING
WINDOWS
BENCHMARKS
AT
ABOUT
THE
SAME
SPEED
AS
IN
SYSTEM
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THAT
IS
TRUE
BUT
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HEAR
IF
ANYONE
HAS
ANY
TECHNICAL
DATA
ON
THIS
