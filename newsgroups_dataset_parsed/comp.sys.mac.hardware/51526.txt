TO
FIX
TRACKBALL
THE
TRACKBAL
ON
MY
NO
LONGER
MOVES
IN
THE
HORIZONTAL
DIRECTION
WHEN
I
CALLED
THE
NEAREST
AUTHORIZED
APPLE
SERVICE
PERSON
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
PROBABLY
NEEDED
REPLACING
AND
THAT
WOULD
COST
ME
OVER
OUCH
CAN
ANYONE
RECOMMEND
A
LESS
EXPENSIVE
WAY
TO
FIX
THIS
PROBLEM
ONE
STRANGE
SYMPTOM
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
WHEN
I
TAKE
THE
BALL
OUT
OF
THE
SOCKET
AND
SHINE
A
LIGHT
INTO
THE
HOLE
I
CAN
MAKE
THE
CURSOR
MOVE
HORIZONTALLY
BY
MOVING
THE
WHEEL
WITH
MY
FINGER
IT
WORKS
FINE
THAT
WAY
BUT
WONT
WORK
IF
I
TURN
OFF
THE
LIGHT
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
OR
COMMENTS
