actually
i
thought
macs
were
suppoused
to
be
restarted
once
a
day
nope
i
keep
my
mac
running
all
the
time
since
it
also
acts
as
a
usenet
node
and
exchanges
mail
and
news
every
half
hour
i
run
uaccess
and
receives
all
my
faxes
i
do
turn
off
the
monitors
hooked
up
to
it
they
produce
more
heat
than
i
want
it
can
be
warm
in
my
garage
office
in
the
summer
ive
got
one
of
those
handy
power
control
centers
at
frys
to
i
just
flip
the
switch
in
front
when
i
start
or
stop
working
by
the
way
this
strategy
seems
to
be
somewhat
endorsed
by
apple
since
their
new
color
classic
will
turn
off
its
own
monitor
after
a
certain
length
of
idle
time
