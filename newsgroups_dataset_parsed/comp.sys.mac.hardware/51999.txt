we
bought
one
from
relax
technologies
big
mistake
the
drive
had
some
jumpers
set
incorrectly
so
it
didnt
work
at
first
and
the
software
they
shipped
with
it
was
incompatable
with
the
drive
it
was
the
new
compression
model
and
worst
of
all
when
i
opened
the
drive
up
to
fiddle
with
the
jumpers
i
found
the
inside
of
the
case
covered
with
metal
filings
sorry
to
shout
apparently
when
they
drilled
the
mounting
holes
in
the
case
they
forgot
to
clean
it
before
putting
the
drive
in
this
was
a
hp
drive
by
the
way
and
is
now
working
fine
knock
on
wood
no
thanks
to
relax
technologies
i
have
found
that
you
should
observe
the
following
with
almost
all
new
equipment
check
for
warrany
tape
if
none
carefully
open
unit
inspect
for
loose
wires
jumpers
screws
and
other
trash
clean
up
these
manufacturing
mistakes
now
power
up
the
unit
and
check
it
out
i
cant
think
of
how
many
things
ive
bought
that
werent
okay
right
out
of
the
box
due
to
sloppy
