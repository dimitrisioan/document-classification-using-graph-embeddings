this
does
not
make
sencewhy
would
the
work
but
the
not
workit
is
the
same
monitor
without
accucolor
and
digital
controlsworks
fine
at
with
svgawhats
the
dealanyway
you
can
get
a
svga
with
and
for
at
damarkare
you
saing
that
it
probably
would
work
while
a
nec
wont
the
has
a
maximum
horizontal
scan
rate
of
so
driving
it
at
to
get
x
on
the
mac
is
way
beyond
the
tolerance
the
is
speced
at
so
going
is
only
above
the
minimally
guaranteed
figure
i
too
doubt
if
the
damark
monitor
would
sync
to
a
mac
at
x
like
most
things
you
get
what
you
pay
thats
the
deal
