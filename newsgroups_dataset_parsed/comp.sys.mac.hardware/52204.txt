BOLLINGER
BUZZAPPLECOM
WRITES
USE
THE
SOUND
MANAGER
AND
WORK
FINE
ON
ALL
MACHINES
THE
MORE
OF
THE
STORY
IS
TO
DEVELOPERS
DONT
CHEAT
REALLY
I
AM
ABSOLUTELY
POSITIVELY
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
DO
WHAT
I
AM
ABOUT
TO
DO
BUT
IM
GOING
SAY
IT
ANYWAY
STOP
CHEATING
ON
SOUND
REALLY
SOON
YOU
WILL
BE
SORRY
AS
EVEN
THOSE
WITHOUT
EXTERNAL
SPEAKERS
WILL
BE
DISAPPOINTED
WITH
YOUR
SOUND
ON
FUTURE
HARDWARE
THE
GRACE
PERIOD
IS
ABOUT
TO
END
THE
SOUND
MANAGER
IS
UNDERSTANDABLE
NOW
AND
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
AND
WILL
WORK
EVEN
BETTER
SOON
SO
USE
IT
DONT
BE
SILLY
USING
THE
SOUND
MANAGER
ON
A
QUADRA
IS
VERY
WELL
BUT
USING
SM
ON
ANY
OF
THE
LOWEND
MACHINES
DOESNT
SIMPLY
WORK
FOR
A
DECENT
ACTION
GAME
SINCE
IT
JUST
STEALS
TOO
MUCH
TIME
FROM
THE
CPU
THIS
IS
A
FACT
BY
WRITING
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
HARDWARE
ON
AN
SE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
HAVE
SIMULTANEOUS
CHANNELS
OF
SAMPLED
SOUND
FOR
A
COST
OF
APPROX
CYCLES
EXACTLY
HOW
WOULD
YOU
DO
THAT
USING
THE
SM
PRAY
TELL
THE
CORRECT
THING
TO
DO
IS
TO
USE
THE
SM
ON
THE
MACHINES
THAT
CAN
CARRY
THAT
EXTRA
LOAD
USING
THE
SM
MEANS
AND
TO
WRITE
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
SOUND
HARDWARE
ON
THE
MACHINES
THAT
CANT
ITS
NOT
THE
POLITICALLY
CORRECT
THING
BUT
FROM
THE
DEVELOPERS
POINT
OF
VIEW
IT
