how
do
they
compare

the
real
question
here
in
my
opinion
is
what
motorola
processors
running
system
on
a
mac
are
comparable
to
what
intel
processors
running
windows
on
a
pc
i
stuff
deleted
david
even
better
than
that
how
does
a
amiga
perform
in
daily
tasks
compared
to
my
iici
answer
except
in
a
very
few
cases
i
get
my
butt
kicked
by
the
amiga
sure
there
are
other
considerations
but
it
goes
to
show
you
how
proper
design
from
the
beginning
in
hardware
and
software
can
give
you
great
returns
as
well
as
showing
you
that
if
you
dont
have
a
marketing
department
to
speak
of
no
one
will
care
how
good
your
system
is
im
still
happy
with
my
ci
but
i
dont
understand
why
the
performance
is
so
bad
comparatively
they
could
have
done
multitasking
properly
they
could
have
done
everthing
else
better
but
apple
didnt
of
course
dos
and
windows
are
nothin
to
write
home
about
either
oh
well
yall
got
worth
for
the
price
of
peter
pundy
email
ive
got
no
witty
wisdom
to
share
but
have
a
nice
day
anyway
