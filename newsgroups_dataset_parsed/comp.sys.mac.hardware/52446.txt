RE
MONITORS
SHOULD
THEY
BE
KEPT
ON
HOURS
A
DAY
I
HAVE
SOME
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THIS
SUBJECT
I
LIKE
TO
LEAVE
MY
COMPUTER
ON
IF
I
THINK
IM
GOING
TO
BE
USING
IT
WITHING
THE
NEXT
OR
HOURS
BUT
I
GET
SICK
OF
MY
DAD
CONSTANTLY
COMING
UP
TO
ME
AND
ASKING
WHY
IS
THE
COMPUTER
ON
IF
YOURE
NOT
USING
IT
I
ALSO
WONDER
ABOUT
MY
COMPUTER
BEING
HARMED
BY
FLUCTUATIONS
IN
VOLTAGE
FROM
OTHER
THINGS
GARBAGE
DISPOSAL
ETC
HERE
ARE
MY
QUESTIONS
HOW
MUCH
HARM
DO
VOLTAGE
FLUCTUATIONS
CAUSE
MY
COMPUTER
DOES
NOT
SHARE
A
CIRCUIT
WITH
ANYTHING
BIG
BUT
OUR
MY
LIGHT
DIMS
WHEN
A
REFRIGERATOR
COMES
ON
OR
THE
GARBAGE
DISPOSAL
IS
TURNED
ON
WHOSE
DOESNT
AND
ALSO
WHEN
THE
WASHING
MACHINE
DOES
ANYTHING
ALL
THESE
THINGS
CAUSE
A
DROP
IN
VOLTAGE
WHICH
IS
HARMFUL
TO
A
COMPUTER
RIGHT
I
ALSO
NOTICE
THE
FAN
IN
MY
SYSTEM
SAVER
TURNING
AT
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
IS
IT
SAFER
TO
TURN
IT
OFF
AND
BACK
ON
WHEN
I
WANT
TO
USE
IT
OR
TO
LEAVE
IT
ON
HOW
MUCH
ELECTRICITY
DOES
MY
COMPUTER
USE
I
HAVE
AN
APPLE
IIGS
NE
FLAMES
WITH
A
KENSINGTON
SYSTEM
SAVER
GS
ELECTRIC
FAN
INSIDE
AN
APPLECOLOR
RGB
MONITOR
AND
AN
EXTERNAL
HD
FAN
AND
ITS
OWN
PS
HOW
DO
I
TRANSLATE
THIS
INTO
KILOWATTHOURS
ALSO
HOW
MUCH
OF
THIS
IS
USED
BY
THE
MONITOR
DOES
THE
MONITOR
USE
CONSIDERABLY
LESS
JUICE
WHEN
THE
SCREEN
IS
TOTALLY
BLACK
BUT
STILL
ON
MANY
COMPUTERS
SPIN
THE
HD
UP
AND
DOWN
CONSTANTLY
TO
SAVE
POWER
I
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
HARMFUL
TO
THE
HD
AND
DEFEATS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
LEAVING
THE
COMPUTER
ON
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
EXCEPT
PORTABLES
IS
THIS
TRUE
THANKS
FOR
THE
INFO
I
THINK
THIS
WILL
HELP
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
STACY
