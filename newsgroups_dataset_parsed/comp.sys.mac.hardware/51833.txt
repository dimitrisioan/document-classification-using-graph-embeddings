I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
SPECIFIC
PROBLEM
MENTIONED
IN
YOUR
MESSAGE
BUT
I
DEFINITELY
HAD
SCSI
PROBLEMS
BETWEEN
MY
AND
MY
VENERABLE
JASMINE
MEGADRIVE
CARTRIDGE
STUFF
DELETED
I
DOUBT
THIS
IS
A
QUADRASPECIFIC
PROBLEM
I
HAD
TO
GET
RID
OF
MY
VENERABLE
BERNOULLI
LAST
YEAR
WITH
ENOUGH
STUFF
DELETED
MIGHT
FIX
THE
PROBLEM
IN
MY
CASE
THE
CARTRIDGES
WOULDNT
FORMATMOUNTPARTITION
FOR
AUX
ALL
I
KNOW
IS
THAT
THE
MEGADRIVES
WORKED
PERFECTLY
ON
BOTH
MY
MAC
PLUS
AND
MY
POWERBOOK
IT
WAS
FOR
THIS
REASON
I
ASSUMED
THE
PROBLEM
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
QUADRA
EVEN
WITH
THE
QUADRA
THEY
MOSTLY
WORKED
OK
THE
PROBLEM
OCCURRED
WHEN
I
EJECTED
A
CARTRIDGE
FROM
A
DRIVE
IT
WOULD
START
POPPING
UP
DIALOG
BOXES
SAYING
THIS
CARTRIDGE
MUST
BE
FORMATTED
WITH
JASMINE
DRIVEWARE
EVEN
THOUGH
THERE
WAS
NO
CARTRIDGE
IN
THE
DRIVE
MARK
THE
PROBLEM
MENTIONED
LAST
IS
A
KNOWN
QUADRA
SCSI
PROBLEM
IT
WAS
HEAVILY
DISCUSSED
LAST
YEAR
AND
AN
APPLE
EMPLOYEE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
ONE
BYTE
ERROR
IN
THE
SCSI
DRIVER
ROUTINE
FOR
THE
QUADRAS
AT
LEAST
THE
AND
SYSTEM
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
THAT
PROBLEM
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
THE
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
GET
AN
UPDATED
DRIVER
FROM
THE
DRIVE
MANUFACTOR
IN
MY
CASE
MASS
MICROSYSTEMS
WROTE
A
NEW
DRIVER
WHICH
FIXED
THE
PROBLEM
ON
MY
QUADRA
ALL
THAT
OCCURED
EARLY
LAST
YEAR
