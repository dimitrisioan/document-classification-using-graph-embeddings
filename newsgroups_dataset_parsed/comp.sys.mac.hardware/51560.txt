JUST
COMPLETED
A
SUCCESSFUL
UPGRADE
OF
A
AN
SI
TO
MHZ
IM
WAITING
ON
DELIVERY
OF
A
MHZ
CLOCK
FOR
A
FINAL
SPEED
TRIAL
DEFINITELY
NEEDED
THE
HEATSINK
THE
CPU
WAS
QUITE
HOT
TO
THE
TOUCH
AT
HIGHER
SPEEDS
UNTIL
I
GLUED
ON
A
CENT
RADIO
SHACK
SINK
I
MADE
A
CALL
FOR
REPORTS
OF
FAILURES
LAST
WEEK
NO
REPORTS
HAVE
ARRIVED
HERE
LOCALLY
IN
SEATTLE
THERE
IS
A
REPORTED
CPU
DAMAGE
DUE
TO
THE
USER
SLIPPING
WITH
THE
IRON
AND
PUTTING
A
GASH
INTO
THE
BOARD
NOT
EXACTLY
A
PROBLEM
DUE
TO
THE
CPU
RUNNING
TOO
FAST
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
HAVE
A
POLL
TO
REPORT
TOP
SPEEDS
AND
SYSTEM
CONFIGURATIONS
INCLUDING
PDS
AND
NUBUS
CARDS
WHICH
WERE
USED
ID
BE
HAPPY
TO
COORDINATE
AND
REPORT
