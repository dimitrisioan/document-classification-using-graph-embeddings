MONITOR
JITTER
SEVERAL
WEEKS
AGO
I
DESCRIBED
A
PROBLEM
WITH
MY
APPLE
HIGHRESOLUTION
MONITOR
AND
PROMISED
TO
SUMMARIZE
REPLIES
RECEIVED
BY
EMAIL
TO
RECAPITULATE
OCCASIONALLY
EVERY
TWO
OR
THREE
HOURS
OR
SO
MY
MONITOR
MOMENTARILY
LOSES
SYNC
THE
ENTIRE
RASTER
IMAGE
BOUNCES
DOWN
ABOUT
AN
EIGHTH
OF
AN
INCH
OR
SO
THEN
RIGHTS
ITSELF
THIS
USUALLY
HAPPENS
RIGHT
AFTER
I
CLOSE
A
LARGE
WINDOW
HIGHLIGHT
A
LARGE
AREA
OR
DO
SOMETHING
THAT
RADICALLY
ALTERS
THE
IMAGE
ON
THE
SCREEN
SOMETIMES
THOUGH
IT
HAPPENS
WITH
NO
PROVOCATION
WHATSOEVER
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
A
BEWILDERING
RANGE
OF
REPLIES
AT
ONE
EXTREME
WAS
A
MAN
CLEARLY
QUITE
KNOWLEDGABLE
ABOUT
MONITORS
WHO
SAID
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
THE
MONITORS
POWER
SUPPLY
SIMPLY
COULDNT
ALWAYS
KEEP
UP
WITH
SUDDEN
CHANGES
OF
THE
RASTER
IMAGE
THE
RAPID
CHANGE
FROM
A
LARGELY
LIGHT
SCREEN
TO
A
LARGELY
DARK
ONE
OVERTAXED
THE
MONITORS
POWER
SUPPLY
THERE
WAS
NO
FIX
AVAILABLE
HE
SAID
BECAUSE
NOTHING
WAS
REALLY
WRONG
I
GUESS
HE
MEANT
THAT
THE
FLAW
WAS
SO
FUNDAMENTAL
THAT
IT
HAD
TO
BE
ENDURED
THIS
SEEMED
QUITE
PERSUASIVE
AND
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TEMPTED
TO
ADOPT
AN
ATTITUDE
OF
STOICISM
EXCEPT
FOR
A
REPLY
FROM
A
MONITOR
OWNER
WHO
DISCOVERED
THAT
THIS
VERY
PROBLEM
IS
DOCUMENTED
IN
THE
APPLE
SERVICE
TECHNICAL
PROCEDURES
VOLUME
UNDER
THE
HEADING
JITTER
CORRECTION
THE
SECTION
DESCRIBES
A
FIX
INVOLVING
THE
REPLACEMENT
OF
A
CAPACITOR
THE
ADJUSTMENT
OF
A
POTENTIOMETER
OR
FAILING
THAT
THE
SWAP
OF
A
CIRCUIT
BOARD
I
WOULD
BE
GRATEFUL
FOR
A
DISCUSSION
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
HAD
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
