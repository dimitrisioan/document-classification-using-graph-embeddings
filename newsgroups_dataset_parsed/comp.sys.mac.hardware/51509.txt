QUARDA
IS
A
POPULAR
MISSPELLING
OF
QUADRA
WHICH
HAS
A
MHZ
PROCESSOR
THE
HAS
A
MHZ
AND
SOME
LOCAL
BUSES
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
RUN
FASTER
THE
VIDEO
IS
DIFFERENT
ALSO
THE
CAN
RUN
A
AND
I
BELIEVE
A
MONITOR
IN
BIT
COLOR
WITHOUT
A
VRAM
UPGRADE
ACTUALLY
YOU
COULD
PUT
AS
MUCH
VRAM
INTO
A
AS
YOU
WANT
AND
YOU
STILL
WONT
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
COLOR
ON
ANY
MONITOR
ITS
NOT
PART
OF
THE
ONBOARD
VIDEO
THE
HOWEVER
CAN
USE
VIDEO
ON
MONITORS
UP
TO
WITH
OF
VRAM
HADES
YES
BUT
IF
YOU
UPGRADE
THE
VRAM
IN
A
YOU
GET
BIT
COLOR
SO
YOU
REALLY
DONT
CARE
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
OUT
THE
BOX
THE
HAS
MORE
VIDEO
CAPABILITY
FOR
THE
SAME
SIZE
MONITORS
THE
CAN
DO
BIT
WITH
BOTH
AND
DOESNT
SUPPORT
AND
DOES
BIT
ON
MONITORS
