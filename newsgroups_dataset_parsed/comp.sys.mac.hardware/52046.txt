YES
I
KNOW
COMPUTERS
AND
HARDDISK
DRIVES
SHOULD
BE
ALWAYS
ON
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
MONITORS
THEY
GENERATE
A
LOTS
OF
HEAT
SHOULD
I
OR
SHOULDNT
I
KEEP
THEM
ON
HOURS
A
DAY
ANY
ADVICE
THANKS
TAKE
CAREPAUL
THERE
HAS
BEEN
NO
EMPIRICAL
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
THE
FIRST
STATEMENT
TRUE
THERE
IS
A
POWER
SURGE
AT
STARTUP
THAT
HAS
THE
POTENTIAL
TO
DO
DAMAGE
BUT
THE
INTERNAL
POWER
SUPPLY
IS
WELLPROTECTED
IVE
TURNED
MY
MAC
ON
AND
OFF
SIX
OR
SEVEN
TIMES
A
DAY
FOR
THREE
YEARS
WITHOUT
PROBLEM
THE
MONITOR
IS
THE
SAME
TO
LEAVE
IT
ON
IS
TO
WASTE
A
LOT
OF
ELECTRICITY
TWICE
AS
MUCH
AS
A
TELEVISION
POSSIBLY
MORE
TURN
IT
OFF
WHEN
YOURE
NOT
USING
IT
ITLL
SAVE
YOU
MONEY
AND
THE
WORLD
A
FEW
MORE
RESOURCES
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
TURING
YOUR
COMPUTER
ON
AND
OFF
CONSTANTLY
IS
NOT
DUE
TO
THE
POWER
SURGE
AT
START
UP
IT
IS
DUE
TO
THERMAL
FATIGUE
YOU
TURN
ON
YOUR
COMPUTER
IT
HEATS
UP
AND
EVERYTHING
EXPANDS
YOU
TURN
IT
OFF
IT
COOLS
OFF
AND
EVERYTHING
CONTRACTS
THERE
IS
A
LIMITED
NUMBER
OF
CYCLES
OF
THIS
THAT
ANY
COMPONENT
CAN
TAKE
BEFORE
IT
FAILS
MODERN
ELECTRONICS
ARE
MUCH
MORE
ROBUST
IN
THIS
RESPECT
THAN
THEIR
PREDECCESORS
IN
FACT
PORTABLE
COMPUTERS
ARE
DESIGNED
WITH
THIS
IN
MIND
SINCE
THE
SLEEP
FUNCTION
THAT
EXTENDS
BATTERY
LIFE
ALSO
GREATLY
INCREACES
THE
NUMBER
OF
THERMAL
CYCLES
THAT
OCCUR
AS
A
RULE
OF
THUMB
IF
I
AM
NOT
GOING
TO
USE
MY
COMPUTER
AND
THIS
INCLUDES
THE
MONITOR
IN
THE
NEXT
HOURS
I
TURN
IT
OFF
I
ALWAYS
DIM
THE
MONITOR
WHEN
NOT
IN
USE
TO
PROLONG
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
PHOSPHOR
I
TEND
TO
THINK
THAT
WITH
THE
PACE
OF
TECHNICAL
INNOVATION
IN
THE
COMPUTER
INDUSTRY
YOU
SHOULD
BE
MUCH
LESS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
FATIGUE
LIFE
OF
YOUR
EQUIPMENT
AND
MORE
CONCERNED
WITH
HOW
LONG
YOUR
PARTICULAR
ARCHITECTURE
WILL
BE
SUPPORTED

HARDWARE
AND
