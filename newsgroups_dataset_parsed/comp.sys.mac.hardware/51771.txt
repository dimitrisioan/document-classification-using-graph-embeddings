RE
WHY
DOES
APPLE
GIVE
US
A
CONFUSING
MESSAGE
IN
MONTHIAN
WRITES
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHY
APPLE
HAS
AN
AMBIGUOUS
MESSAGE
FOR
REGARDING
FPU
IN
ALL
MAC
PRICE
LISTS
IVE
SEEN
EVERY
AS
THE
MESSAGE
FPU
OPTIONAL
I
KNOW
FROM
WHAT
WEVE
DISCUSSED
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
THAT
ALL
HAVE
THE
FPU
BUILT
IN
EXCEPT
THE
CONFIGURATION
WHY
WOULD
THEY
BE
SO
UNCLEAR
ABOUT
THIS
ISSUE
IN
THEIR
PRICE
LIST
PERHAPS
THE
REASON
IS
SIMPLEMAYBE
THE
MARKETING
PEOPLE
WHO
PUT
TOGETHER
THE
BROCHURES
AND
PRICE
LISTS
WERENT
CLEAR
ON
THE
FPU
ISSUE
AFTERALL
APPLES
LITERATURE
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
CORRECT
A
FUNNY
ONE
I
NOTICED
RECENTLY
IS
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
BROCHURES
ON
THE
MACS
WITH
CD
CAPABILITY
REFER
TO
THE
AUTO
INKJET
FEATURE
THIS
SHOULD
HAVE
READ
AUTO
INJECT
FEATURE
AS
IT
DOES
ON
SOME
OTHER
CORRECT
BROCHURES
IVE
SEEN
FROM
APPLE
SINCE
IT
WAS
CORRECT
ON
SOME
OLDER
BROCHURES
I
CAN
ONLY
GUESS
THAT
SOMEONE
EDITED
THE
COPY
SAW
INJECT
AND
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
A
TYPO
AND
CHANGED
IT
TO
THE
MORE
FAMILIAR
WORD
INKJET
HMMM
WHAT
WOULD
THAT
BE
A
PRINTER
BUILT
INTO
THE
CD
PLAYER
A
WAY
OF
WRITING
INFORMATION
TO
A
CD
