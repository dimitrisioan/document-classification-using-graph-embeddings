HOW
DO
I
EXPAND
RAM
ON
A
PLUS
I
HAVE
A
MAC
PLUS
WITH
RAM
I
HAVE
JUST
BOUGHT
AN
EXTRA
SO
THAT
I
CAN
HAVE
THE
MAX
RAM
THAT
A
PLUS
SUPPORTS
HOWEVER
I
CANT
GET
IT
TO
BOOT
AFTER
I
INSTALL
THE
EXTRA
SIMMS
INSTEAD
I
GET
A
SAD
MAC
SORRY
BUT
I
CANT
REMEMBER
THE
CODE
LOOKING
AT
THE
MOTHERBOARD
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
RESISTORS
HAVE
BEEN
SNIPPED
OFF
WHERE
IT
SAYS
PATH
ROW
I
ASSUME
THAT
WAS
DONE
WHEN
THE
FIRST
SIMMS
WERE
ADDED
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
ARE
THERE
ANY
OTHER
RESISTORS
THAT
NEED
SNIPPING
OR
DO
I
HAVE
BUM
SIMMS
WHICH
NEED
TO
BE
EXCHANGED
ANY
AND
ALL
ADVICE
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED
