I
AM
WORKING
A
DATA
ACQUISITION
AND
ANALYSIS
PROGRAM
TO
COLLECT
DATA
FROM
INSECT
SENSORY
ORGANS
STUFF
DELETED
ANOTHER
ALTERNATIVE
IS
THE
USE
OF
THE
SOUND
INPUT
PORT
CAN
YOU
REALLY
MAKE
DUE
WITH
THE
NONEXISTENT
DYNAMIC
RANGE
OF
AN
CONVERTER
OF
PROBABLY
DUBIOUS
LINEARITY
AND
MONOTONICITY
AND
PERHAPS
ACCOUPLED
AS
WELL
IT
CLEARLY
DEPENDS
ON
THE
TYPE
OF
QUESTIONS
YOU
ARE
ASKING
BUT
IN
MANY
CASES
IT
WILL
DO
FINE
THE
CRITICAL
INFORMATION
FROM
THE
NEURON
IS
IN
THE
FIRING
FREQUENCY
MAXIMUM
ABOUT
ACTION
POTENTIALS
PER
SECONDS
AND
NOT
IN
THE
AMPLITUDE
OF
THE
SIGNAL
OR
IN
DETAILS
OF
THE
SIGNAL
SHAPE
SO
THE
RESOLUTION
OF
ABOUT
YOU
GET
WITH
AN
BIT
CONVERTOR
IS
MORE
THEN
SUFFICIENT
AC
COUPLING
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
BE
A
PROBLEM
EITHER
SINCE
IN
MANY
CASES
YOU
ARE
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
THE
DC
LEVEL
MY
PRE
AMPLIFIER
IS
AC
COUPLED
ALSO
THE
CRITICAL
POINT
IS
THE
LOWEST
FREQUENCY
THAT
WILL
PASS
IF
THE
CUTOFF
POINT
IS
TO
HIGH
THE
ACTION
POTENTIALS
WILL
BE
SLIGHTLY
DISTORTED
BUT
EVEN
THAT
NORMALLY
DOES
NOT
MATTER
SINCE
IT
IS
THE
OCCURRENCE
OF
THE
SPIKE
THAT
IS
IMPORTANT
HOWEVER
I
DO
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHAT
EXACTLY
I
CAN
EXPECT
BEFORE
I
START
BATTLING
WITH
THE
TOOLBOX
TO
GET
IT
GOING
AS
YET
I
HAVE
NO
CLUE
WERE
TO
START
LOOKING
FOR
THE
TECHNICAL
SPECIFICATIONS
