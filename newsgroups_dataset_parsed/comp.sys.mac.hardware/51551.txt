datadesk
keyboard
to
go
with
my
new
centris
and
have
a
problem
doing
desktop
rebuilds
i
hold
down
the
command
and
option
keys
and
restart
but
nothing
happens
the
dip
switches
are
set
the
right
way
and
the
command
and
option
keys
seem
to
work
on
anything
else
im
running
btw
anyone
know
what
the
problem
is
terry
i
am
resending
this
message
because
my

i
recently
bought
an
lciii
and
a
datadesk
i
dont
remember
trying
to
rebuild
the
desktop
with
it
however
it
did
give
me
a
strange
problem
when
i
held
down
shift
during
startup
to
disable
all
extensions
nothing
happened
i
tried
it
with
another
keyboard
using
the
same
adb
connector
cable
and
it
worked
with
the
other
keyboard
the
shift
key
on
the
datadesk
keyboard
worked
well
otherwise
i
checked
the
dipswitches
and
they
are
fine
try
disabling
your
extensions
and
tell
me
if
it
works
i
am
annoyed
with
datadesk
i
sent
them
the
keyboard
in
the
mail
for
inspectionrepairreplacement
the
technician
on
the
phone
said
they
have
a
day
turn
around
time
meaning
you
should
receive
the
inspectedrepaired
keyboard
in
that
time
well
they
have
had
the
keyboard
for
over
weeks
and
i
still
have
gotten
very
little
info
from
them
about
it
its
annoying
because
it
cost
me
to
send
them
the
keyboard
and
their
technical
support
line
is
not
toll
free
tell
me
if
you
have
a
similar
experience
with
them
