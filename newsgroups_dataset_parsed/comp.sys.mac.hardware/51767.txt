my
sister
has
an
apple
color
display
hooked
up
to
an
lc
problem
there
is
an
annoying
horizontal
ghostlike
stripe
that
precesses
vertically
about
once
per
second
it
is
about
cm
high
she
is
in
grave
danger
of
going
insane
because
of
it
any
ideas
of
what
it
might
be
and
how
i
might
cure
it
for
her

ps
if
i
pick
up
the
display
i
thought
it
might
be
rfi
from
the
lc
it
seems
to
get
worse
this
can
be
caused
by
two
one
of
two
things
the
first
and
easiest
to
fix
is
interference
from
something
around
the
monitor
such
as
another
monitor
or
other
electrical
device
try
moving
the
system
to
another
location
to
fix
that
problem
second
because
of
the
scan
rate
of
the
monitor
it
tends
to
synchronize
with
room
lights
and
can
cause
the
interference
you
are
seeing
try
turning
off
all
lights
in
the
rooms
around
the
system
and
see
if
that
helps
if
not
try
moving
the
system
somewhere
else
a
third
solution
would
be
to
get
a
apple
color
display
it
should
not
have
the
same
problem
the
color
is
more
suceptible
to
you
can
try
calling
apples
