monitors
and
video
cards
for
hello
all
i
am
thinking
about
buying
an
external
monitor
for
my
and
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
in
netland
has
any
advice
for
me
i
am
mostly
thinking
about
a
color
monitor
and
an
bit
card
that
can
switch
between
and
something
higher
like
i
read
an
old
report
on
a
card
from
lapis
that
could
do
this
but
could
not
use
the
external
monitor
as
the
main
screen
with
menubar
which
to
me
is
a
major
draw
back
has
this
perhaps
been
fixed
or
can
any
other
cards
do
this
like
the
micron
xceed
also
which
monitor
should
i
buy
at
the
moment
i
am
leaning
towards
the
sony
or
what
exactly
is
the
difference
between
these
but
are
there
any
other
good
cheap
monitors
i
should
know
about
doesnt
the
monitor
have
to
be
multisync
to
support
cards
that
can
switch
resolutions
please
send
me
email
and
ill
summarize
i
would
also
greatly
appreciate
getting
the
email
addresses
of
any
mail
order
companys
that
sell
monitors
or
cards
thanks
in
advance
