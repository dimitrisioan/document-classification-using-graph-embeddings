WAS
WONDERING
IF

OUT
IN

THINKING
ABOUT
A

I
READ
AN
OLD
REPORT
ON
A
CARD

COULD
DO
THIS
BUT
COULD
NOT
USE
THE
EXTERNAL
MONITOR
AS
THE
MAIN
SCREEN
WITH
MENUBAR
WHICH
TO
ME
IS
A
MAJOR
DRAW
BACK
HAS
THIS
PERHAPS
BEEN
FIXED
OR
CAN
ANY
OTHER
CARDS
DO
THIS
LIKE
THE
MICRON
XCEED
ALSO
WHICH
MONITOR
SHOULD
I
BUY
AT
THE
MOMENT
I
AM
LEANING
TOWARDS
THE
SONY
OR
WHAT
EXACTLY
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THESE
BUT
ARE
THERE
ANY
OTHER
GOOD
CHEAP
MONITORS
I
SHOULD
KNOW
ABOUT
DOESNT
THE
MONITOR
HAVE
TO
BE
MULTISYNC
TO
SUPPORT
CARDS
THAT
CAN
SWITCH
RESOLUTIONS
