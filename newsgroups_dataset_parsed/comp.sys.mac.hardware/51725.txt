TCPIP
ROUTING
LOCALTALKETHERNET
HERE
IS
THE
STORY
I
HAVE
A
NETWORK
WITH
MACS
ON
LOCALTALK
ONE
OF
THEM
HAS
AN
ETHERNET
CARD
AND
IS
CURRENTLY
CONNECTED
TO
A
NEXT
DONT
LAUGH
I
GOT
IT
FOR
THE
PRICE
OF
A
MAC
IISI
THE
NEXT
IS
CONNECTED
TO
THE
INTERNET
OVER
SLIP
RUNNING
ON
A
BAUD
MODEM
CURRENTLY
WE
CAN
TELNET
FROM
THE
MAC
W
ETHERNET
TO
THE
NEXT
AND
THEN
TELNET
OUT
AGAIN
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
WHAT
WE
WANT
TO
KNOW
IS
IF
THERE
IS
SOME
SORT
OF
HARDWARE
THAT
WILL
ROUTE
TELNET
SESSIONS
FROM
THE
LOCALTALK
MACS
TO
THE
NEXT
VIA
THE
ETHERNET
MAC
FROM
WHAT
WE
HAVE
HEARD
AIR
DOESNT
DO
THE
TRICK
SOFTWARE
SOLUTIONS
WOULD
BE
GOOD
TOO
BUT
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
THERE
ARENT
GOING
TO
BE
ANY
OUR
IMMEDIATE
INTEREST
IS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
TO
THE
NEXT
AND
TELNET
OUT
AGAIN
THE
SLIP
CONNECTION
DOESNT
ALLOW
US
TO
ASSIGN
IP
NUMBERS
TO
MACHINES
SO
EVERYONE
SHARES
THAT
NUMBEROH
WELL
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
