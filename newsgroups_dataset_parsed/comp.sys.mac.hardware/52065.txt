YES
I
KNOW
COMPUTERS
AND
HARDDISK
DRIVES
SHOULD
BE
ALWAYS
ON
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
MONITORS
THEY
GENERATE
A
LOTS
OF
HEAT
SHOULD
I
OR
SHOULDNT
I
KEEP
THEM
ON
HOURS
A
DAY
ANY
ADVICE
WELL
THE
MONITOR
IS
CONSISTENTLY
THE
LARGEST
POWER
DRAIN
ON
YOUR
ELECTRIC
BILL
WHEN
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
AT
YOUR
COMPUTER
SETUP
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
LARGE
OR
GREATER
COLOR
MONITOR
GENERALLY
WHAT
I
DO
IS
LEAVE
MY
MAC
ON
ALL
THE
TIME
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
OCCASIONAL
RESART
OR
SYETEM
CRASH
BUT
I
TURN
MY
MONITOR
OFF
EACH
NIGHT
BEFORE
I
LEAVE
MY
OFFICE
I
ALSO
TURN
OFF
AFTER
DARK
WHEN
I
DO
THIS
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
HAVE
THE
SCREEN
SAVER
RUNNING
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
PICTURE
BEING
DISPLYED
ON
THE
MONITORS
TUBE
ACTUALLY
I
THOUGHT
MACS
WERE
SUPPOUSED
TO
BE
RESTARTED
ONCE
A
DAY
REALLY
WHAT
MAKES
YOU
THINK
THIS
THE
FILE
SERVER
IN
MY
OFFICE
HAS
BEEN
ON
FOR
THE
LAST
MONTHS
STRAIGHT
AND
IT
HASNT
HAD
ANY
PROBLEMS
NOTE
I
ALSO
KEEP
THE
MONITOR
FOR
THE
FILE
SERVER
TURNED
OFF
WHEN
IM
NOT
ACTUALLY
WORKING
ON
THE
SERVER
ITSELF
HADES
