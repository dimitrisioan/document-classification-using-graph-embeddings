zyxel
strings
i
write
i
recently
got
a
zyxel
modem
its
great
but
im
still
having
some
problems
figuring
out
what
strings
to
use
in
what
applications
i
basically
need
strings
for
zterm
firstclass
client
and
telefinder
client
ive
been
able
to
get
firstclass
and
zterm
working
by
using
another
modems
settings
in
firstclass
and
copying
them
for
zterm
however
it
still
has
problems
zterm
for
example
will
list
error
the
first
time
i
try
dialing
after
starting
the
problem
if
i
cancel
and
try
again
it
works
fine
telefinder
is
even
worse
i
cant
get
it
to
even
wake
up
the
modem
so
if
anyone
uses
a
zyxel
for
any
of
these
programs
id
greatly
appreciate
you
sending
me
the
setup
strings
you
use
thanks
in
advance

i
cant
help
you
with
firstclass
or
telefinder
but
ive
been
using
zterm
and
a
zyxel
for
close
to
two
weeks
now
heres
what
i
did
once
in
zterm
set
hardware
handshaking
on
and
the
bps
rate
to
youve
probably
already
done
this
then
i
typed
atw
the
first
line
sets
the
modem
to
ignore
the
dtr
line
necessary
for
hardware
handshaking
with
most
though
not
all
mac
hardware
handshaking
cables
the
second
stores
this
setting
in
nonvolatile
memory
in
the
modem
so
its
the
default
when
the
modem
starts
in
the
modem
preferences
dialog
i
have
the
modem
initialization
string
set
to
which
just
insures
that
the
stored
setting
is
used
useful
if
starting
zterm
after
using
something
like
the
fax
software
or
macwoof
which
change
the
settings
in
other
ways
alternatively
you
could
leave
the
factory
default
the
way
it
is
and
just
set
the
zterm
initialization
string
to
which
would
accomplish
the
same
thing
if
the
modem
is
always
on
before
you
start
zterm
and
if
other
programs
dont
modify
the
settings
or
would
work
even
if
other
programs
modify
the
modems
settings
i
do
it
the
way
i
do
because
i
sometimes
forget
to
turn
on
the
modem
before
launching
zterm
and
this
way
im
assured
of
having
the
correct
dtr
handling
when
the
modems
powered
up
after
comparing
the
above
strings
with
my
at
commands
reference
guide
i
came
up
with
this
is
entered
in
the
initialize
box
on
the
modem
preferences
in
zterm
quick
summary
of
each

see
manual
assume
dtr
computer
is
always
on
dial
speed
at
as
fast
as
zyxel
can
handle
in
firstclass
i
used
this
same
string
with
the
addition
of
right
before
the
command
in
the
setup
box
this
disables
the
autoanswer
function
of
the
modem
for
firstclass
i
based
my
modem
setting
on
the
supra
and
just
changed
the
above
mentioned
string
in
telefinder
i
based
my
setting
on
the
zoom
hh
setting
i
changed
the
modem
initialization
string
to
the
same
one
i
used
for
firstclass
and
everything
seems
to
work
fine
sorry
it
took
so
long
to
get
this
summary
out
if
someone
wants
to
forward
this
to
the
infomacreports
directory
at
sumexaim
it
might
save
other
newbie
zyxel
users
like
myself
the
trouble
of
setting
up
their
strings
and
also
save
the
net
some
redundant
messages
if
anyone
else
has
something
to
add

free
