WORKING
BY
USING
ANOTHER
MODEMS
SETTINGS
IN
FIRSTCLASS
AND
COPYING
THEM
FOR
ZTERM
HOWEVER
IT
STILL
HAS
PROBLEMS
ZTERM
FOR
EXAMPLE
WILL
LIST
ERROR
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
TRY
DIALING
AFTER
STARTING
THE
PROBLEM
IF
I
CANCEL
AND
TRY
AGAIN
IT
WORKS
FINE
TELEFINDER
IS
EVEN
WORSE
I
CANT
GET
IT
TO
EVEN
WAKE
UP
THE
MODEM
SO
IF
ANYONE
USES
A
ZYXEL
FOR
ANY
OF
THESE
PROGRAMS

YOSHIOCSUCLAEDU
WRITES
FOR

I
INITIALLY
DID
THE
FOLLOWING
THEN
I
SET
MY

RSMITHPEARLTUFTSEDU
ROD
SMITH
WRITES
I
CANT
HELP
YOU
WITH
FIRSTCLASS
OR
TELEFINDER
BUT
IVE
BEEN
USING
ZTERM
AND
A
ZYXEL
FOR
CLOSE
TO
TWO
WEEKS
NOW
HERES
WHAT
I
DID
ONCE
IN
ZTERM
SET
HARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
ON
AND
THE
BPS
RATE
TO
YOUVE
PROBABLY
ALREADY
DONE
THIS
THEN
I
TYPED
ATW
THE
FIRST
LINE
SETS
THE
MODEM
TO
IGNORE
THE
DTR
LINE
NECESSARY
FOR
HARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
WITH
MOST
THOUGH
NOT
ALL
MAC
HARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
CABLES
THE
SECOND
STORES
THIS
SETTING
IN
NONVOLATILE
MEMORY
IN
THE
MODEM
SO
ITS
THE
DEFAULT
WHEN
THE
MODEM
STARTS
IN
THE
MODEM
PREFERENCES
DIALOG
I
HAVE
THE
MODEM
INITIALIZATION
STRING
SET
TO
WHICH
JUST
INSURES
THAT
THE
STORED
SETTING
IS
USED
USEFUL
IF
STARTING
ZTERM
AFTER
USING
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
FAX
SOFTWARE
OR
MACWOOF
WHICH
CHANGE
THE
SETTINGS
IN
OTHER
WAYS
ALTERNATIVELY
YOU
COULD
LEAVE
THE
FACTORY
DEFAULT
THE
WAY
IT
IS
AND
JUST
SET
THE
ZTERM
INITIALIZATION
STRING
TO
WHICH
WOULD
ACCOMPLISH
THE
SAME
THING
IF
THE
MODEM
IS
ALWAYS
ON
BEFORE
YOU
START
ZTERM
AND
IF
OTHER
PROGRAMS
DONT
MODIFY
THE
SETTINGS
OR
WOULD
WORK
EVEN
IF
OTHER
PROGRAMS
MODIFY
THE
MODEMS
SETTINGS
I
DO
IT
THE
WAY
I
DO
BECAUSE
I
SOMETIMES
FORGET
TO
TURN
ON
THE
MODEM
BEFORE
LAUNCHING
ZTERM
AND
THIS
WAY
IM
ASSURED
OF
HAVING
THE
CORRECT
DTR
HANDLING
WHEN
THE
MODEMS
POWERED
UP
AFTER
COMPARING
THE
ABOVE
STRINGS
WITH
MY

THIS
DISABLES
THE

I

JUST

FINE
SORRY

TO

OUT
IF
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
FORWARD
THIS

AT

IT
MIGHT
SAVE
OTHER
NEWBIE
ZYXEL
USERS
LIKE
MYSELF
THE
TROUBLE
OF
SETTING

AND
ALSO
SAVE

ELSE
HAS
