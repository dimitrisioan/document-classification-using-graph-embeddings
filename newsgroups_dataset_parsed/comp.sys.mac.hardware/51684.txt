many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded
that
mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
thats
fine
but
would
you
name
the
industy
experts
so
i
can
try
to
track
this
down
who
knows
i
just
quoted
what
was
written
in
scsi
director
this
doesnt
sound
right
to
me
dont
quadras
use
the
if
so
the
mac
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
scsi
timing
thats
all
handled
by
the
chip
yup
thats
why
im
kinda
curious
most
scsi
problems
ive
encountered
are
due
to
cabling
ive
tried
calling
transoft
corp
about
this
and
have
either
gotten
the
response
huh
to
yep
to
nah
you
would
expect
that
a
damaging
state
ment
like
this
would
have
some
data
to
back
it
up
anyone
want
transofts
phone
number
jim
jagielski
and
hes
gonna
stiff
me
so
