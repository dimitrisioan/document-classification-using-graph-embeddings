RE
SIMMS
FOR
BE
CAREFUL
BEFORE
BUYING
IN
ARTICLE
MARTY
SACHS
WRITES
I
PURCHASED
MB
NS
SIMMS
FOR
MY
QUADRA
FROM
CHIP
MERCHANT
IVE
BEEN
VERY
SATISFIED
WITH
THEM
IN
THE
PAST
EITHER
ONE
ALONE
WORKS
BUT
BOTH
TOGETHER
FAIL
I
CALLED
APPLE
FOR
ADVICE
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
COMPOSITE
SIMMS
ONLY
NONCOMPOSITE
SIMMS
SHOULD
BE
USED
WITH
THE
CHIP
MERCHANT
CONFIRMED
THAT
THEY
PRESENTLY
SELL
ONLY
COMPOSITE
SIMMS
SO
SIMMS
NEED
TO
BE
BOTH
NS
AND
NONCOMPOSITE
MB
SIMMS
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
BE
COMPOSITE
SIMMS
ALTHOUGH
MANY
MOST
MB
SIMMS
ARE
SIMMS
ALLOW
TWO
MEMORY
BANKS
PER
SIMM
THUS
PERMITTING
THE
USE
OF
MB
DRAM
DEVICES
THE
SAME
ONES
USED
ON
MB
SIMMS
TO
BE
USED
FOR
TWO
MB
BANKS
ON
ONE
SIMM
I
CANT
IMAGINE
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
CHEAPER
TO
BUILD
AN
MB
SIMM
USING
MB
DRAMS
AS
THE
MB
PARTS
REACHED
AND
EXCEEDED
BIT
FOR
BIT
PRICE
PARITY
WITH
THE
MB
PARTS
SOME
TIME
AGO
ITS
PROBABLY
POSSIBLE
TO
BUILD
A
SINGLEBANK
MB
SIMM
USING
MB
PARTS
THIS
COULD
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
IN
A
IM
NOT
SURE
WHY
YOUD
WANT
TO
DO
THIS
THOUGH
AS
A
DUALBANK
MB
SIMM
WOULD
BE
CHEAPER
TO
BUILD
THAN
A
SINGLEBANK
COMPOSITE
