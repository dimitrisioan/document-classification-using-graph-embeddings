NEVER

DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW

OPEN
UP

MOUSE
II
MINE
LIVES
NEAR
A
CAT
TRUE
REALLY
AND
PICKS
UP
HER
FUR
FROM
WHAT
I
CAN
TELL
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
APPLE
WELDED
IT
SHUT
BY
ROTATING
THE
PLATE
AROUND
THE
MOUSE
BALL
COUNTERCLOCKWISE
YOU
CAN
OPEN
THE
MOUSE
AND
CLEAN
IT
IT
ISNT
AS
OBVIOUS
AS
THE
DESKTOP
BUS
MOUSE
I
BUT
IT
OPENS
QUITE
EASILY
ONCE

IF

YOU
DONT

I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
MEANT
OPENING
THE
MOUSE
NOT
JUST
RELEASING
THE
BALL
AND
GETTING
TO
THE
ROLLERS
I
FOUND
THAT
ON
THE
ORIGINAL
ADB
MOUSE
SOMETIMES
UNSCREWING
THE
TWO
HALVES
ALLOWED
FOR
EASIER
CLEANING
IF
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
HAS
HIS
ANSWER
ILL
ASK
HOW
DO
YOU
OPEN
THE
NEW
ERGONOMIC
MOUSE
BY
OPEN
I
MEAN
SPLIT
THE
TWO
HALVES
TO
GET
AT
THE
GUTS
IT
ISNT
OBVIOUS
TO
ME
BASED
ON
THE
MINUTE
LOOK
I
SPENT
WITH
ONE
AT
THE
OFFICE
YESTERDAY
AS
THERE
ARE
NO
VISIBLE
SCREW
HEADS
