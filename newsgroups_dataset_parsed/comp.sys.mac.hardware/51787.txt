a
friend
asked
me
to
build
a
cable
to
connect
an
hp
fetal
heart
monitor
to
a
maciontosh
no
problem
sez
i
i
wanted
to
demo
it
on
my
pb
it
wont
work
the
pb
has
been
used
running
zterm
and
kermit
using
both
internal
and
external
modems
so
i
dont
think
its
the
powerbook
per
se
when
i
send
a
to
the
hp
it
responds
with
a
test
of
the
serial
ports
it
works
on
the
but
not
on
the
i
thought
that
the
is
connected
to
earth
ground
and
so
is
the
hp
so
i
connected
from
the
chassis
of
the
hp
to
the
pw
audio
ground
connector
still
ng
any
thoughts
battery
powered
devices
like
the
powerbook
are
sometimes
more
sensitive
to
serial
port
weirdness
i
had
trouble
with
connecting
my
mac
plus
to
an
hp
handheld
everything
else
worked
okay
on
that
port
but
not
the
hp
it
runs
on
two
penlite
batteries
it
turned
out
that
the
plus
by
accident
or
by
design
flaw
was
putting
a
volt
bias
on
the
serial
port
that
was
doing
weird
things
to
the
hp
which
has
only
dc
the
hp
worked
fine
when
connected
to
the
printer
port
does
your
pb
screen
get
dim
or
anything
when
connected
to
the
device
have
you
tried
using
the
printer
port
good
luck
