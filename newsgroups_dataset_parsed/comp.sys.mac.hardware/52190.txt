QUESTION
IS
AN
UNQUALIFIED
YES
YOU
CAN
USE
ANY
OLD
VGASVGA
MONITOR

CENTRIS
YOU
DO
NEED
AN
ADAPTOR
I
USE
A
MAC
VGAQ
FROM
JAMES
ENGINEERING
TO
RUN
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
MACHINES
THE
ADAPTOR

HAVE
MENTIONED

ADAPTOR
WILL
ALLOW
YOU
TO
CHOOSE
RESOLUTION
I
PREFER
THIS
ON
MY
THEN
YOU
HAVE
THE
QUESTION
OF
MATCHING
ADAPTORS
AND
SYNC
RATES
I
WOULD
ADVOCATE
CALLING

THE
COMMENT

THE
PERSON
