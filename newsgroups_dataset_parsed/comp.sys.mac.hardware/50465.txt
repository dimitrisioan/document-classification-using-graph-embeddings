any

what
companie
makes
that

apple
was
never
able
to
provide
any
docs
or
tools
to
program
that
chip
i
value
it
as
the
least
value
per
piece
of
computer
hardware
i
ever
bought
due
to
the
complete
lack
support
tools
there
was
a
refund
for
usbuyers
of
this
card
but
we
europeans
were
left
out
in
the
rain
once
again
i
agree
completely
but
there
was
only
a
refund
for
people
who
bought
the
gc
with
a
quadra
i
have
seen
an
alpha
version
of
an
extension
from
apple
called
gc
quicktime
video
which
offloads
quicktime
compressiondecompression
from
the
cpu
to
the
on
the
card
so
it
seems
it
can
be
done
even
though
in
a
developer
article
it
states
that
the
gc
cant
be
programmed
but
they
asked
that
any
suggestions
be
sent
in
anyway
