another
thing
why
a
scsi
interface
because
scsi
works
well
with
removable
media
and
works
well
with
large
capacity
devices
the
floppy
interface
you
suggest
handles
the
former
but
it
doesnt
have
any
hooks
for
dealing
with
the
latter
youd
have
to
kludge
it
plus
its
extremely
low
performance
and
scsi
has
gobs
of
room
for
expansion
compared
with
a
floppy
i
can
just
see
it
lets
stick
a
a
a
tape
drive
and
a
mo
drive
all
on
the
floppy
interface
the
possibilities
for
unexpected
collisions
are
enormous
