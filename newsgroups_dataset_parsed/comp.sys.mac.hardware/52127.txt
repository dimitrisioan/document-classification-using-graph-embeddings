THE
ELECTRICY
CONSUMPTION
WILL
GO
DOWN
IF
YOU
TURN
THEM
OFF
OVERNIGHT
ALONG
WITH
HEAT
I
WONDER
HOW
HARD
IT
WOULD
BE
IE
WHAT
IT
WOULD
ADD
TO
THE
COST
TO
DESIGN
DESKTOP
MACHINES
WITH
A
POWER
SAVER
FEATURE
BUILT
IN
WHICH
WOULD
REDUCE
POWER
CONSUMPTION
AUTOMATICALLY
IF
THE
MACHINE
IS
IDLE
FOR
MORE
THAN
SOME
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
THIS
IS
PRETTY
STANDARD
IN
PORTABLE
MACHINES
AND
THE
SAME
KINDS
OF
TRICKS
COULD
BE
PLAYED
SPINNING
DOWN
DISKS
TURNING
OFF
SCREENS
REDUCING
CLOCK
SPEED
ETC
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THIS
OVER
JUST
TURNING
THE
THING
OFF
WOULD
BE
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
TO
DO
ANYTHING
AND
THE
MACHINE
IS
STILL
AVAILABLE
OVER
THE
NETWORK
THE
TRICKY
PART
MIGHT
BE
IN
DEFINING
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
INACTIVITY
CERTAINLY
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
WAKE
UP
FROM
SLEEP
MODE
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMEBODY
PINGED
YOU
BUT
YOU
DO
WANT
TO
WAKE
UP
AT
LEAST
THE
CPU
IF
SOMEBODY
LOGS
IN
VIA
A
TELNET
CONNECTION
I
WOULDNT
WORRY
TOO
MUCH
ABOUT
WASTING
ELECTRICITY
IN
THE
WINTER
MONTHS
THAT
ENERGY
IS
JUST
GETTING
TURNED
INTO
HEAT
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
EFFICIENT
A
WAY
TO
HEAT
A
BUILDING
AS
THE
CENTRAL
HEATING
PLANT
BUT
ITS
NOT
TOO
BAD
IN
THE
SUMMER
THOUGH
ITS
A
DISASTER
NOT
ONLY
ARE
YOU
WASTING
THAT
POWER
BUT
YOURE
PROBABLY
ALSO
RUNNING
THE
AIR
CONDITIONING
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
WASTE
HEAT
