RE
MONITORS
SHOULD
THEY
BE
KEPT

I
WONDER
HOW
HARD
IT
WOULD
BE
IE
WHAT
IT
WOULD
ADD
TO
THE
COST
TO
DESIGN
DESKTOP
MACHINES
WITH
A
POWER
SAVER
FEATURE
BUILT
IN
WHICH
WOULD
REDUCE
POWER
CONSUMPTION
AUTOMATICALLY
IF
THE
MACHINE
IS
IDLE
FOR
MORE
THAN
SOME
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
ABOUT
AS
HARD
AS
IT
WAS
TO
DESIGN
THE
COLOR
CLASSIC
SINCE
ITS
MONITOR
BEHAVES
IN
JUST
THIS
MANNER
HADES
