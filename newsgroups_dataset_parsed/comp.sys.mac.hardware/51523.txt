HAYES
WRITES
YOU
CAN
FIND
RETAIL
THAT
IS
WITHIN
THE
PRICE
OF
A
KEYBOARD
OF
EDUCATIONAL
PRICES
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
WARY
OF
RETAIL
OUTLETS
SELLING
AS
CHEAP
AS
EDUCATIONAL
PRICES
I
WENT
FOR
A
RETAILER
ACTUALLY
MAIL
ORDER
CDA
COMPUTERS
BECAUSE
ITS
PRICE
WAS
BETTER
THANT
THE
CAMPUS
COMPUTER
STORE
I
FOUND
OUT
WHY
LATER
ON
WHEN
I
TRIED
TO
GET
A
REPAIR
DONE
AT
AN
APPLE
REGISTERED
REPAIR
CENTER
THE
CPU
WAS
A
RESALE
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
HAD
BEEN
REMOVED
AND
REPLACED
WITH
A
NONSTANDARD
NUMBER
PROBABLY
FROM
CDA
COMPUTERS
CONSEQUENTLY
THE
APPLE
REPAIR
MAN
COULD
NOT
DO
ANY
WARRENTY
REPAIRS
SO
I
ENDED
UP
WITH
JUST
A
WARRENTY
FROM
CDA
OVER
THE
APPLE
WARRENTY
BOY
WAS
I
PIED
MORAL
OF
THE
STORY
CAVEAT
EMPTOR
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
GO
WITH
A
RELIABLE
TRUSTWORTHY
MAIL
ORDER
FIRM
IF
THEY
EXIST
MAYBE
SOMEONE
COULD
ENLIGHTEN
US
WITH
THEIR
EXPERIENCES
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
GET
A
BETTER
PRICE
THAN
YOUR
LOCAL
EDUCATIONAL
OUTLET
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
MAIL
ORDER
OUT
OF
STATE
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
SALES
TAX
YET
THOUGH
FOR
HOW
MUCH
LONGER
REMAINS
TO
BE
SEEN
THE
ADDITION
IN
SALES
TAX
ON
A
CPU
PURCHASE
WILL
PROBABLY
WIPE
OUT
AN
EDUCATIONAL
DISCOUNT
AGAIN
CAVEAT
EMPTOR
SOME
MAIL
ORDER
COMPANIES
DO
INCLUDE
SALES
TAX
ON
PURCHASES
EVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
OUT
OF
