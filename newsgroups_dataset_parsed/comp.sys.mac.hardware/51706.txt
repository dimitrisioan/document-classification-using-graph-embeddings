KU
KU
IN
HONG
KONG
YOU
CAN
BUY
A
CHEAP
PC
OR
BASED
COMPUTER
KU
HOWEVER
IT
IS
VERY
EXPERIENCE
TO
BUY
A
MACINTOSH
LAST
WINTER
I
WAS
KU
BACK
TO
HONG
KONG
I
SAW
THE
PRICE
OF
MAC
CLASSIC
IN
HONG
KONG
IS
SAME
KU
PRICE
TO
BUY
A
LC
IN
THE
US
KU
KU
I
AM
NOT
RECOMMENDED
TO
BUY
MAC
IN
HONG
KONG
SINCE
MAC
IS
NOT
POPULAR
KU
IN
HK
KU
KU
KIN
HUNG
AU
HELLO
MR
AU
I
HAVE
TO
DISAGREE
REGARDING
YOUR
ASSESSMENT
OF
MACINTOSH
IN
HONG
KONG
THE
MAC
HAS
A
SIZEABLE
SHARE
OF
THE
TYPESETTING
MARKET
AS
IN
THE
US
A
LOCAL
MAGAZINE
NEXT
MAGAZINE
SIMILAR
TO
NEWSWEEK
HERE
USES
THE
MAC
EXTENSIVELY
I
HAVE
SEEN
SIR
SPEEDY
AND
OTHER
FRANCHISES
IN
HONG
KONG
EQUIPPED
WITH
MACBASED
SYSTEMS
TRUE
THE
DISCOUNT
IS
NOT
AS
STEEP
AS
HERE
BECAUSE
CUSTOMERS
IN
HONG
KONG
CANNOT
BUY
FROM
GRAY
MARKET
NOR
ARE
MAC
BEING
SOLD
THRU
MASS
MERCHANDISERS
LIKE
APPLE
DOES
HERE
WITH
THE
PERFORMA
LIN
E
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
SALE
OF
MAC
IS
HANDLED
BY
ONE
EXCLUSIVE
DISTRIBUTOR
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
GET
A
PC
CLONE
OR
IN
THE
EARLIER
DAYS
ILLEGAL
CLONES
OF
THE
APPLE
IIE
YOUR
PERCEPTION
OF
THE
MAC
NOT
BEING
TOO
POPULAR
IN
HONG
KONG
IS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
MOST
HOBBYISTS
AND
USERS
FIND
IT
MUCH
CHEAPER
TO
GO
TO
ONE
OF
THOSE
BASEMENT
STORES
THAT
SELL
PC
CLONES
WITH
PROBABLY
ILLEGAL
COPIES
OF
BIOS
THAN
TO
PAY
FOR
A
MAC
SIMILARLY
YOU
CANNOT
SAY
LOTUS
SURELY
IS
NOT
WELL
ACCEPTED
IN
HONG
KONG
BECAUSE
THE
SALE
IS
SO
LOW
MAY
BE
IT
IS
BECAUSE
OF
ALL
THOSE
PLACES
IN
KOWLOON
WHERE
ILLEGAL
COPIES
OF
LOTUS
CAN
BE
BOUGHT
FOR
AND
FOR
A
PROFESSIONAL
LOOKING
BUT
ILLEGAL
COPIES
