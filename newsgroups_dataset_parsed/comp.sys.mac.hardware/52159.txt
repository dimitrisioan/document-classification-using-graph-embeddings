yes
i
know
computers
and
harddisk
drives
should
be
always
on
but
what
about
monitors
they
generate
a
lots
of
heat
should
i
or
shouldnt
i
keep
them
on
hours
a
day
any
advice
thanks
take
carepaul
there
has
been
no
empirical
evidence
to
support
the
first
statement
true
there
is
a
power
surge
at
startup
that
has
the
potential
to
do
damage
but
the
internal
power
supply
is
wellprotected
ive
turned
my
mac
on
and
off
six
or
seven
times
a
day
for
three
years
without
problem
the
monitor
is
the
same
to
leave
it
on
is
to
waste
a
lot
of
electricity
twice
as
much
as
a
television
possibly
more
the
computer
itself
uses
far
less
electricity
than
a
tv
monitordepends
on
the
size
but
one
thing
not
to
do
is
use
a
selfshutdown
or
powershutdown
ironappliance
on
the
same
electric
line
after
a
new
monitor
and
power
supply
and
modem
my
wife
still
doesnt
think
her
iron
is
at
fault
she
should
know
better
being
a
biomed
engineer
brett
theres
nothing
so
passionate
as
a
vested
interest
disguised
as
an
intellectual
conviction
