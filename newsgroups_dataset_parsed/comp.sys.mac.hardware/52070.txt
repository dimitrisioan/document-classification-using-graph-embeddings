i
know
of
several
nubus
framegrabber
boards
but
wonder
if
there
might
be
similar
ones
for
the
lesser
macs
those
without
slots
something
permitting
instant
freezing
of
a
video
picture
pal
and
feeding
it
in
without
jaggies
to
a
simple
digitizer
like
macvision
which
takes
secs
to
scan
a
picture
so
a
frame
grabber
is
a
necessity
the
objective
is
pixel

have
tried
using
topquality

with
freezeframe
function

the
