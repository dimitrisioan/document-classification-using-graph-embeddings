RE
PRICE
DROP
ON
WITHIN
MONTHS
NATHANIEL
SAMMONS
WRITES
I
AM
GOING
TO
BE
GETTING
A
SOON
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
APPLE
TO
COME
OUT
WITH
THE
CYCLONES
AND
THE
TEMPEST
IN
A
MONTH
AND
HAVE
THE
PRICE
DROP
ON
THE
SYSTEM
I
WANT
I
HAVE
NEGOTIATED
A
GOOD
DEAL
WITH
A
SUPPLIER
FOR
A
AND
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
JUMP
ON
IT
BUT
AGAIN
I
DONT
WANT
THE
PRICE
DROP
TO
SMUTHER
ME
BTW
THE
DEAL
I
HAVE
IS
A
WITH
MOUSE
FOR
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
OF
A
BETTER
DEAL
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
SAY
IT
BEST
BUT
YOU
ARE
GAURENTEED
THAT
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
IS
GOING
TO
DROP
THIS
YEAR
THIS
WEEKS
MACWEEK
REPORTS
THAT
APPLE
IS
PROBABLY
PLANNING
A
DROP
IN
AUGUST
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
IT
MAY
COME
SOONER
IF
APPLE
DECIDES
TO
CHANGE
THE
PRICE
STRUCTURE
UPON
RELEASE
OF
THE
MULTIMEDIA
UNITS
THIS
SUMMER
YOUR
PRICE
LOOKS
PRETTY
GOOD
AT
ABOUT
MORE
THEN
I
PAYED
FOR
MINE
LAST
MONTH
I
WOULD
HAVE
RATHER
WAITED
FOR
ONE
OF
THE
NEW
MACHINES
THIS
SOMMER
LIKE
THE
CYCLONE
BUT
THE
RESALE
VALUE
OF
MY
IICI
WOULD
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
SQUAT
BY
THEN
THUS
FINANCING
FORCED
ME
TO
PURCHASE
NOW
IM
HAPPY
WITH
THE
MACHINE
AND
WONT
FEEL
BETRAYED
AT
ALL
WHEN
APPLE
CUTS
THE
PRICE
TO
LESS
THEN
NEXT
WEEK
HEH
BOTTOME
LINE
IF
THE
DOES
WHAT
YOU
WANT
BUY
IT
IF
YOU
WAIT
UNTIL
THE
CYLCONES
COME
OUT
FOR
A
PRICE
BREAK
THEN
YOU
MIGHT
AS
WELL
WAIT
FOR
THE
POWERPCS
TO
COME
OUT
FOR
ANOTHER
PRICE
BREAK
AND
THEN
THE
UNITS
WHICH
FOLLOW
THEM
YOU
MAY
SAVE
SOME
MONEY
BUT
YOUVE
LOST
A
LOT
OF
TIME
WHEN
YOU
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
USING
THE
COMPUTER
FACE
IT
APPLES
PRICES
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
IN
A
CONTINUOUS
STATE
OF
FLUX
AT
LEAST
THEY
ARENT
GOING
TO
TRY
RAISING
THEM
AGAIN
