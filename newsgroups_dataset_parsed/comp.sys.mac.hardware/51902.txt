SERIAL
LINE
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
DUO
AND
PC
IN
ARTICLE
PETRACKVNETIBMCOM
WRITES
I
HAVE
TRIED
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
UNDER
THE
SUN
TO
GET
A
NULL
MODEM
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
A
MAC
DUO
AND
A
PC
I
HAVE
USED
MACKERMIT
AND
VERSATERM
ON
THE
MAC
SIDE
I
HAVE
USED
PROCOMM
KERMIT
AND
SOFTERM
ON
ON
THE
PC
OR
PS
SIDE
I
HAVE
USED
NONHARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
AND
HARDWARE
AHDSHAKING
CABLES
AND
KNOW
MY
HANDS
ARE
SHAKING
FROM
THE
EFFORT
NOTHING
HAS
ALLOWED
FILE
TRANSFERS
FROM
THE
MAC
TO
THE
PS
COULD
I
HEAR
FROM
SOMEONE
ATTESTING
THAT
THEY
CAN
REALLY
PUMP
INFORMATION
OUT
THE
SERIAL
PORT
OF
A
DUO
FAST
LIKE
VIA
A
MODEM
OR
VIA
A
SYSEX
DUMP
COULD
ANYONE
WITH
A
DUO
HELP
ME
OUT
I
AM
GOING
ABSOLUTELY
INSANE
I
WANNA
KNOW
IF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
MY
DUO
OR
ALL
DUO
OR
ALL
DUOS
OR
JUST
ME
HMMM
SOUNDS
VAGUELY
SIMILAR
TO
A
PROBLEM
I
HAD
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
WHEN
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
USE
KERMIT
I
WAS
BUILDING
A
SERIAL
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
MY
DUO
AND
MY
NEXT
I
THINK
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
IN
THE
HANDSHAKING
BASICALLY
YOU
NEED
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THE
HANDSHAKING
PROTOCOL
IS
THE
SAME
ON
BOTH
SIDES
A
SAFE
PLACE
TO
START
IS
BY
SELECTING
NO
HANDSHAKING
ON
EITHER
END
ONE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
ZILOG
SERIAL
CHIP
SEEMS
TO
GET
PERMANENTLY
WEDGED
IF
YOU
TALK
TO
IT
WRONG
AND
ONLY
A
RESET
WILL
CLEAR
IT
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
SPECIFICS
BUT
THIS
COULD
BE
A
NONLINEARITY
THAT
SCREWS
UP
YOUR
ATTEMPTS
AT
DEBUGGING
THE
SYSTEM
IT
COULD
VERY
WELL
BE
THAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
THINGS
RIGHTEVENTUALLY
BUT
ONE
WRONG
MOVE
LIKE
TRYING
A
BAD
HANDSHAKING
PROTOCOL
CAN
SCREW
UP
ANY
FURTHER
CORRECT
ACTIONS
UNTIL
THE
NEXT
MACHINE
RESET
I
HAVE
WEDGED
MY
MAC
AND
ALSO
MY
NEXT
THAT
WAY
NOW
I
CAN
SEND
FILES
BACK
AND
FORTH
BETWEEN
THE
DUO
AND
THE
NEXT
WITHOUT
ANY
PROBLEM
AND
AT
PRETTY
HIGH
SPEEDS
TOO
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
KIND
OF
CHIP
THE
PC
USES
BUT
I
THINK
THE
ZILOG
IS
PRETTY
STANDARD
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
AVERY
