HERES
WHY
WELL
FOLKS
AFTER
SOME
THOUGHT
THE
ANSWER
STRUCK
ME
FLAT
IN
THE
FACE
WHY
WOULD
APPLE
RELEASE
A
DUO
DOCK
WITH
A
PROCESSOR
OF
ITS

HERES
WHY
PEOPLE
HAVE
HOUNDED
APPLE
FOR
A
NOTEBOOK
WITH
A

IN
IT
APPLE
CANT
DELIVER
THAT
RIGHT
NOW
BECAUSE
THE
SAPS
TOO
MUCH
POWER
RADIATES

TOO
MUCH
HEAT
AND

TOO
LARGE
FOR
A
NOTEBOOK
HOW
DOES

GET
AROUND
THAT
WITHOUT
DESIGNING
A
NEW
CHIPSET
USE
EXISTING
POWERBOOK
