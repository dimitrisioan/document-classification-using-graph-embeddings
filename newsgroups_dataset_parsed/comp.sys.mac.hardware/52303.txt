i
am
looking
at
a
new
lc
iii
and
a
used
iici
prices
the
iici
has
much
greater
potential
for
expansion
a
la
nubus
and
greater
memory
capacity
how
important
is
this
how
many
nubus
cards
do
you
haveplan
to
acquire
how
much
memory
do
you
really
need
ive
got
a
ci
and
of
ram
thats
plenty
i
also
have
a
graphics
card
on
the
nubus
im
a
sucker
for
pretty
picturesi
think
the
lciii
can
have
a
bootable
ramdisk
in
memory
which
a
ci
can
not
have
at
least
not
out
of
the
box
the
lc
iii
would
be
new
under
warranty
newer
roms
is
the
iici
clean
and
would
have
sound
input
i
also
like
the
pizzabox
case
the
ci
is
clean
i
solved
the
sound
input
problem
with
a
macrecorder
but
thats
gotten
to
be
a
fairly
expensive
solution
now
that
macromind
owns
macrecorder
performancewise
i
have
read
that
they
are
almost
identical
the
lc
iii
being
a
little
slower
the
actual
difference
is
probably
not
worth
worrying
over
so
which
should
i
get
depends
on
the
price
you
can
get
the
ci
for
educationally
speaking
the
lciii
here
at
fsu
can
be
had
at
just
under
add
in
roughly
for
a
monitor
last
id
heard
an
lciii
simm
went
for
i
think
youre
in
a
winwin
situation
no
matter
what
you
decide
youll
most
likely
be
happy
with
it
