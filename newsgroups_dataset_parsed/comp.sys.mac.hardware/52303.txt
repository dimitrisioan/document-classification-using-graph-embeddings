RE
LCIII
OR
USED
IICI
WHICH
SHOULD
I
GET
IN
ARTICLE
ERIKCHESHIREOXYEDU
ERIK
ADAMS
WRITES
I
AM
LOOKING
AT
A
NEW
LC
III
AND
A
USED
IICI
PRICES
THE
IICI
HAS
MUCH
GREATER
POTENTIAL
FOR
EXPANSION
A
LA
NUBUS
AND
GREATER
MEMORY
CAPACITY
HOW
IMPORTANT
IS
THIS
HOW
MANY
NUBUS
CARDS
DO
YOU
HAVEPLAN
TO
ACQUIRE
HOW
MUCH
MEMORY
DO
YOU
REALLY
NEED
IVE
GOT
A
CI
AND
OF
RAM
THATS
PLENTY
I
ALSO
HAVE
A
GRAPHICS
CARD
ON
THE
NUBUS
IM
A
SUCKER
FOR
PRETTY
PICTURESI
THINK
THE
LCIII
CAN
HAVE
A
BOOTABLE
RAMDISK
IN
MEMORY
WHICH
A
CI
CAN
NOT
HAVE
AT
LEAST
NOT
OUT
OF
THE
BOX
THE
LC
III
WOULD
BE
NEW
UNDER
WARRANTY
NEWER
ROMS
IS
THE
IICI
CLEAN
AND
WOULD
HAVE
SOUND
INPUT
I
ALSO
LIKE
THE
PIZZABOX
CASE
THE
CI
IS
CLEAN
I
SOLVED
THE
SOUND
INPUT
PROBLEM
WITH
A
MACRECORDER
BUT
THATS
GOTTEN
TO
BE
A
FAIRLY
EXPENSIVE
SOLUTION
NOW
THAT
MACROMIND
OWNS
MACRECORDER
PERFORMANCEWISE
I
HAVE
READ
THAT
THEY
ARE
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
THE
LC
III
BEING
A
LITTLE
SLOWER
THE
ACTUAL
DIFFERENCE
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
WORTH
WORRYING
OVER
SO
WHICH
SHOULD
I
GET
DEPENDS
ON
THE
PRICE
YOU
CAN
GET
THE
CI
FOR
EDUCATIONALLY
SPEAKING
THE
LCIII
HERE
AT
FSU
CAN
BE
HAD
AT
JUST
UNDER
ADD
IN
ROUGHLY
FOR
A
MONITOR
LAST
ID
HEARD
AN
LCIII
SIMM
WENT
FOR
I
THINK
YOURE
IN
A
WINWIN
SITUATION
NO
MATTER
WHAT
YOU
DECIDE
YOULL
MOST
LIKELY
BE
HAPPY
WITH
IT
