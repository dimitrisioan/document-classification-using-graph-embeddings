DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
EXACTLY
HOW
DIGITAL
ECLIPSE
DOES
THEIR
UPGRADES
SOMEONE
WAS
SUGGESTING
TO
ME
THAT
SOME
CHIPS
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
PERFORM
AT
IS
THIS
TRUE
AND
IF
SO
HOW
DOES
DESI
DEAL
WITH
THAT
WOULD
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
LETTER
IN
MACWEEK
THIS
WEEK
FROM
ONE
OF
THE
HARDWARE
TYPES
AT
DIGITAL
ECLIPSE
HE
SAYS
THAT
THEY
RUN
TESTS
ON
ALL
OF
THE
COMPONENTS
TO
SEE
IF
THEY
WILL
PERFORM
AT
THE
UPGRADED
SPEED
IF
THEY
DO
NOT
THEN
DESI
REPLACES
THEM
WITH
ONES
THAT
DO
HADES
