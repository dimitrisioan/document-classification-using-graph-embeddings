quadra
scsi
problems
i
dont
know
about
the
specific
problem
mentioned
in
your
message
but
i
definitely
had
scsi
problems
between
my
and
my
venerable
jasmine
megadrive
cartridge
drives
my
solution
was
to
get
silverlining
none
of
the
loops
that
involved
blind
writes
worked
to
the
drives
in
fact
the
only
loop
that
worked
was
the
macintosh
software
loop
whatever
that
means
