RE
SIGMA
DESIGNS
DOUBLE
UP
JOSEPH
A
PELLETTIERE
WRITES
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
ANY
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
SIGMA
DESIGNS
DOUBLE
UP
BOARD
ALL
I
CAN
FIGURE
OUT
IS
THAT
IT
IS
A
HARDWARE
COMPRESSION
BOARD
THAT
WORKS
WITH
AUTODOUBLER
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
ALSO
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
ONE
COST
IVE
HAD
THE
BOARD
FOR
OVER
A
YEAR
AND
IT
DOES
WORK
WITH
DISKDOUBLER
BUT
NOT
WITH
AUTODOUBLER
DUE
TO
A
LICENSING
PROBLEM
WITH
STAC
TECHNOLOGIES
THE
OWNERS
OF
THE
BOARDS
COMPRESSION
TECHNOLOGY
IM
WRITING
THIS
FROM
MEMORY
IVE
LOST
THE
REFERENCE
PLEASE
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
USING
THE
BOARD
IVE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
FILE
ICONS
BEING
LOST
BUT
ITS
HARD
TO
SAY
WHETHER
ITS
THE
BOARDS
FAULT
OR
SOMETHING
ELSE
HOWEVER
IF
I
DECOMPRESS
THE
TROUBLED
FILE
AND
RECOMPRESS
IT
WITHOUT
THE
BOARD
THE
ICON
USUALLY
REAPPEARS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
ABOVE
MENTIONED
LICENSING
PROBLEM
THE
FREEWARE
EXPANSION
UTILITY
DD
EXPAND
WILL
NOT
DECOMPRESS
A
BOARDCOMPRESSED
FILE
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
THE
BOARD
INSTALLED
SINCE
STAC
HAS
ITS
OWN
PRODUCT
NOW
IT
SEEMS
UNLIKELY
THAT
THE
HOLES
IN
AUTODOUBLERDISKDOUBLER
RELATED
TO
THE
BOARD
WILL
BE
FIXED
WHICH
IS
SAD
AND
MAKES
ME
VERY
RELUCTANT
TO
BUY
STACS
PRODUCT
SINCE
THEYRE
BEING
SO
STINKY
BUT
HEY
