WRITES
ITS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
HAVE
A
HORIZONTALLY
FORMATTED
HARD
DISK
IN
A
VERTICAL
POSITION
IF
THE
DRIVE
IS
FORMATTED
IN
A
HORIZONTAL
POSITION
IT
CAN
NOT
COMPLETELY
COMPENSATE
FOR
THE
GRAVITATIONAL
PULL
IN
A
VERTICAL
POSITION
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
YOUR
HARD
DISK
WILL
FAIL
TOMORROW

MONTHS
FROM

TAKE
THAT
CHANCE
IF
YOU
WANT

MEANS
THAT
A

FORMATTED
DRIVE
CAN
BE
LATER
PLACED
VERTICALLY
WITH
NO
DATA
INTEGRITY
PROBLEMS
THE
ONLY
WAY
THAT
NEWER
DRIVES
CANNOT
WORK
IS
IF
YOU
HAVE
VARYING
FORCES
SHAKING
BOUNCING
ETC
SO
DONT
PLACE
THE
DRIVE
ON
ITS
SIDE
ON
A
ROCKING
CHAIR
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
A
NEWER
DRIVE
I
DONT
KNOW
TRY
CALLING
