TOLD
BY
A
LOCAL
SALES
THAT
ASANTE
HAS
COME
OUT
WITH
THIS
LCIII
PDS
ETHERNET
ADAPTER
WITH
AN
OPTIONAL
SOCKET
ON
THE
BOARD
MY
QUESTION
IS
WILL
THE
FPU
PERFORMANCE
DEGRADE
WILL
I
PUT
THE
ON
THE
PDS
CARD
SOCKET
INSTEAD
OF
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
ITSELF
INTUITIVELY
THE
MATH
COPROCESSOR
SHOULD
ALWAYS
BE
PLACED
CLOSE
TO
THE
CPU
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
GOOD
APPLES
SOCALLED
PROCESSORDIRECT
SLOT
IS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THROUGHOUT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
THE
ANSWER
TO

I
BELIEVE
THE
FPU
ON
THE
LCIII
IS
ALWAYS
SUPPOSED
TO
GO
ON
THE
LOGIC
BOARD
NOT
IN
THE
PDS
BOARD
I
HAVE
HEARD
OF
CRASHING
PROBLEMS
WITH
PDSBASED
FPUS
ON
THE
LCIII
ASANTE
MAY
HAVE
FIXED
THEM
BUT
WHY
BOTHER
WHY
BOTHER
BUILDING
AN
LCIII
CARD
WITH
AN
FPU
ANYWAY
THE
EXTRA
CIRCUITRY
GIVES
THE
CARD
ONE
MORE
CHANCE
TO
FAIL
I
SAY
FPU
ON
MAIN
LOGIC
BOARD
IN
SOCKET
ETHERNET
ALONE
