if
you
want
to
receive
a
fax
your
computer
will
have
to
be
on
but
not
the
monitor
and
of
course
the
modem
you
can
set
the
number
of
rings
that
will
receive
the
fax
on
a
specific
ring
you
set
with
fax
stf
software
its
entirely
up
to
you
how
to
arrange
that
ive
had
faxes
sent

is
great
but
ive
been
home
to
set
it

dont
have
a
need
to
set

i
hear
there
is
a
device
that
can
channel
all
incoming
phone
signals

also
that
the

company
can
hook
you
