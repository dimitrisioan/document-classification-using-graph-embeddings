GAME
DEVELOPERS
THE
SOUND
DRIVER
AND
CURRENT
SOUND
MANAGER
ARE
INCONVENIENTLY
LAME
FOR
MAKING
GAMES
THE
SOUND
DRIVER
IS
PRETTY
OK
SINCE
ITS
FAST
SOUND
MANAGER
USED
BY
THE
BOOK
IS
USELESS
DISPOSING
OF
SOUND
CHANNELS
AS
SOON
AS
SOUND
HAS
COMPLETED
IS
OUT
OF
THE
QUESTION
FOR
GAMES
WITH
SMOOTH
ANIMATION
ITS
TOO
SLOW
THE
SOUND
DRIVER
IS
SO
MUCH
SNAPPIER
THAN
SOUND
MANAGER
UNFORTUNATELY
SYSTEM
SUPPORTS
IT
POORLY
MAKING
PROGRAMS
CRASH
OCCASIONALLY
THE
MORE
OF
THE
STORY
IS
TO
DEVELOPERS
DONT
CHEAT
REALLY
I
AM
ABSOLUTELY
POSITIVELY
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
DO
WHAT
I
AM
ABOUT
TO
DO
BUT
IM
GOING
SAY
IT
ANYWAY
STOP
CHEATING
ON
SOUND
REALLY
SOON
YOU
WILL
BE
SORRY
AS
EVEN
THOSE
WITHOUT
EXTERNAL
SPEAKERS
WILL
BE
DISAPPOINTED
WITH
YOUR
SOUND
ON
FUTURE
HARDWARE
THE
GRACE
PERIOD
IS
ABOUT
TO
END
THE
SOUND
MANAGER
IS
UNDERSTANDABLE
NOW
AND
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
AND
WILL
WORK
EVEN
BETTER
SOON
SO
USE
IT
WELL
I
WANT
MY
CODE
TO
WORK
ON
OLD
SYSTEMS
TOO
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
SYS
BUT
AT
LEAST
ON
THERE
ARE
BUGS
IN
THE
SOUND
MANAGER
THAT
CAUSES
CHANNELS
TO
HANG
WITH
NO
ERROR
MESSAGE
THIS
HAPPENDS
WHEN
I
KEEP
A
CHANNEL
OPEN
FOR
LONG
PERIODS
NECESSARY
FOR
PERFORMANCE
AND
PLAY
MANY
SOUNDS
STOPPING
SOUNDS
HALFWAY
CALLBACKS
SEEMS
NOT
TO
BE
RELIABLE
THEN
ONLY
WAY
I
CAN
SAFELY
TELL
IF
A
SOUND
HAS
STOPPED
PLAYING
IS
TO
INSPECT
PRIVATE
VARIABLES
IN
THE
CHANNEL
QHEAD
I
THINK
IT
WAS
AND
THE
ONLY
WAY
I
HAVE
FOUND
TO
TELL
IF
A
CHANNEL
IS
HUNG
IS
TO
INSPECT
AN
UNDOCUMENTED
FLAG
AND
MODIFY
IT
AM
I
HAPPY
WITH
THIS
NOPE
I
CONSIDER
WRITING
TO
SOUNDBASE
SIMPLY
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
BUGS
ANY
BETTER
SUGGESTIONS
SILENT
GAMES
IS
NOT
AMONG
