logitec
hand
scan
on
mac
i
have
the
logitech
hand
scanner
for
the
mac
it
uses
a
scsi
interface
box
that
the
standard
scanner
unit
plugs
into
i
have
tried
my
friends
ibm
hand
scanner
with
the
scsi
box
and
it
works
see
if
you
can
get
logitech
to
sell
you
the
scsi
box
by
itself
warning
most
of
the
cost
of
mac
handscanners
is
contained
in
the
scsi
interface
box
so
it
could
run
up
to
around
when
i
upgraded
my
old
style
scanner
to
the
new
gray
scale
model
it
cost
they
just
gave
me
a
new
scan
head
and
software
the
box
was
the
same
the
gray
scale
scanner
interface
runs
about
making
it
around
for
the
interface
