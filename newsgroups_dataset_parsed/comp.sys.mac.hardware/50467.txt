my
macplus
is
having
problems
which
seem
temperature
related
after
using
it
for
a
while
it
freezes
the
when
i
turn
off
then
on
the
screen
doesnt
show
the
disk
icon
and
then
goes
dark
i
consulted
larry
pinas
book
and
could
not
find
these
symptoms
has
anybody
else
seen
such
symptoms
suggestions
shure
it
is
temperature
dependent
but
this
does
not
clean
all
your
problems
based
on
some
exp
i
must
say
that
the
connections
between
the
power
supply
and
the
monitor
and
main
board
are
usable
to
this
failure
ram
simms
can
be
badly
connected
due
to
some
corrosion
and
the
powersupply
can
be
in
the
last
phase
lower
voltage
so
you
can
do
following
if
you
are
used
to
such
technical
terms
clean
all
mentioned
contacts
with
contact
spray
readjust
the
volt
level
of
your
powersupply
use
a
calm
fan
and
think
of
preventing
dust
blowinô
through
the
floppy
a
fixed
piece
of
paper
can
prevent
this
if
you
dont
know
how
to
do
it
beg
a
friendly
technician
