there
isnt
any
copyright
equivalent
of
the
res
ipsa
doctrine
but
theres
something
kind
of
similar
to
show
infringement
one
element
you
need
to
show
is
that
the
defendant
copied
from
your
work
if
youre
lucky
youll
have
direct
evidence
of
copying
the
smoking
gun
normally
you
do
this
through
circumstantial
evidence
by
showing
evidence
of
access
from
which
one
might
reasonably
infer
copying
this
evidence
of
access
is
considered
along
with
the
similarities
between
the
two
works
in
deciding
whether
you
copied
however
if
the
similarities
are
so
strong
as
to
be
striking
an
inference
of
copying
may
be
drawn
even
without
any
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
access
to
your
copyrighted
work
in
that
case
the
burden
will
be
on
the
defendant
to
rebut
the
inference
of
copying
for
example
evidence
that
hed
been
on
a
desert
island
for
the
last
ten
years
and
had
no
contact
with
civilization
wow
now
we
know
why
lawyers
are
rich
and
computer
scientists
are
poor
lawyers
have
to
sound
as
if
they
understand
this
stuff
