HELLO
ALL
FOR
FEW
PAST
DAYS
IVE
BEEN
FIGHTING
TO
GET
MY
NEC
MULTISYNC
PREDECESSOR
OF
TO
WORK
PROPERLY
WITH
THE
INTERNAL
VIDEO
OF
MAC
IIVI
WITH
A
VGAADAPTER
AS
DESCRIBED
IN
DALE
ADAMS
POSTING
ABOUT
QUADRA
VIDEO
IT
WORKS
ONLY
SOME
MINOR
INTERFERENCES
OCCUR
SMALL
ENOUGH
NOT
TO
PREVENT
ANY
ACTION
ON
SCREEN
TO
BE
VISIBLE
CLEAR
BUT
BECAUSE
THE
SCANRATES
STUFF
OF
ARE
WELL
ENOUGH
FOR
EMULATING
APPLE
RGB
I
FIRST
MADE
AN
ADAPTER
THEN
GOT
ONE
FRON
THE
LOCAL
DISTRIBUTOR
OF
NEC
WITH
BOTH
ADAPTERS
I
CAN
GET
A
PICURE
WHICH
LOOKS
EXCELLENT
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
OR
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
BUT
WITH
RADICAL
CHANGES
ON
SCREEN
OPENING
PALETTES
LARGE
WINDOWS
ETC
THERE
ARE
MAJOR
INTERFERENCES
IN
SYNC
THE
PICTURE
EITHER
TILTS
SIDEWAYS
OR
SCRABLES
UP
TOTALLY
EVEN
WHEN
IT
IS
CLEAR
THERE
ARE
SOME
SPIKY
INTERFERENCES
ON
HORIZONTAL
LINE
ALIGNMENT
WHEN
ACCESSING
PULLDOWNS
ETC
WITH
THE
SELFMADE
ADAPTER
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
TO
THE
VGA
ONE
ONLY
SENSE
PINS
DIFFER
IT
IS
SOMETIMES
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
EVEN
BOOT
UP
WITH
A
PICTURE
CLEAR
ENOUGH
TO
SHUT
DOWN
FROM
MENU
WITH
THE
ADAPTER
FROM
NEC
EVERYTHING
IS
WELL
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
BUT
SOMETIMES
THE
PICTURE
TILTS
BADLY
SIDEWAYS
OR
THE
SYNC
IS
COMPLETELY
LOST
BUT
NOT
NEARLY
AS
OFTEN
AS
WITH
THE
SELFMADE
ONE
I
KNOW
WITH
SELF
MADE
ADAPTERS
THERE
CAN
ALWAYS
BE
INTERFERENCE
BUT
WITH
THE
ONE
PROVIDED
BY
NEC
WHERES
THE
SOURCE
OF
THIS
INTERFERENCE
