this
is
an
aside
to
brian
hughess
please
lets
lose
the
cute
phony
names
everybody
posting
about
adding
memory
to
a
quadra
what
phony
names
my
name
is
clearly
visible
in
the
headers
and
i
sing
the
post
with
my
account
name
if
you
have
a
problem
with
that
then
you
will
have
to
get
over
it
ive
used
this
account
name
for
over
years
and
the
people
who
have
been
reading
newsgroups
for
the
last
generally
recognize
hades
as
my
account
name
i
have
no
intention
of
changing
the
way
i
post
i
installed
a
couple
of
simms
in
my
quadra
and
was
somewhat
dismayed
by
the
general
complexity
of
the
operation
compared
to
for
example
the
wonderfully
designed
lc
iii
it
irritates
me
when
apple
refuses
to
tell
how
to
do
it
in
the
users
manual
so
you
have
to
guess
at
how
to
disassemble
the
devise
in
question
its
the
same
for
adding
memory
to
laserwriter
pros
it
isnt
apples
responsibility
to
tell
its
customers
how
to
fool
around
with
its
hardware
that
is
what
apple
service
techs
get
paid
to
do
i
personally
like
the
design
of
the
and
applaud
apple
for
coming
up
with
a
good
way
to
make
use
of
the
front
space
for
all
of
those
drive
bays
i
like
it
a
lot
better
than
the
design
except
for
those
people
who
need
drive
arrays
i
do
however
agree
with
you
about
the
lw
pro
design
the
operation
isnt
very
complicated
if
even
a
minimal
amount
of
help
were
offered
but
apple
leaves
you
working
blind
again
itss
not
apples
place
to
make
it
easy
for
noncertified
service
people
to
fool
around
with
apple
hardware
even
if
they
did
buy
it
of
course
you
are
free
to
do
what
you
want
to
your
mac
just
dont
get
upset
when
your
apple
service
rep
tells
you
that
your
warranty
is
no
longer
valid
after
the
memory
was
installed
i
was
distraught
that
the
top
of
the
simms
came
into
contact
with
the
plastic
case
frame
mine
actually
contacted
the
framework
with
quite
a
lot
of
pressure
enough
so
that
the
assembly
of
the
board
back
to
the
proper
position
was
rather
difficult
and
required
some
force
i
could
have
filed
a
little
excess
material
off
the
top
of
the
simm
boards
but
chose
to
let
it
stand
as
is
i
have
not
had
problems
with
ram
yet
so
i
will
consider
the
problem
annoying
but
not
catastrophic
this
sounds
like
the
kind
of
problem
i
had
when
i
installed
simms
into
an
lc
back
before
lowprofile
simms
were
readily
available
the
standard
simms
would
contact
the
top
of
the
case
and
make
it
a
bit
difficult
to
close
the
lc
but
it
did
close
and
work
just
fine
one
of
the
nice
things
about
logicboards
is
that
they
are
generally
quite
flexible
and
can
withstand
a
fair
amount
of
pressure
