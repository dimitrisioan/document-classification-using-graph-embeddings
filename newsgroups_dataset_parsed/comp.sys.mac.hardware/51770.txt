i
have
a
laserwriter
iig
that
has
disappeared
completely
from
the
network
ie
its
name
doesnt
show
up
in
any
zone
you
can
print
to
it
from
its
serial
interface
tho
i
have
seen
some
discussion
here
about
changing
the
zone
a
iig
is
in
including
some
ps
code
that
lets
you
change
the
zone
is
there
maybe
some
ps
code
you
can
use
to
have
it
go
back
to
all
its
factory
default
settings
i
have
a
feeling
thats
what
needed
to
heal
ours
the
following
postscript
works
for
laserwriter
iigs
with
version

begin
exitserver
