had
heard
a
bit
about
a
rework
of
the
logic
board
i
opened
mine
up
and
found
the
same
rework
with
a
small
chip
glued
to
the
board
and
a
couple
of
green
wires
running
from
it
to
two
other
chips
id
like
to
know
more
about
it
could
anyone
with
any
or
all
of
the
following
information
please
post
it
thanks
a
bunch

does
the
rework

ie
what
does
it

technical
details
of
the
rework
im
looking
for
things
such
as
the
