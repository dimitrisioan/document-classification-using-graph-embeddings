QUADRA
OWNERS
MANY
STORAGE
INDUSTRY
EXPERTS
HAVE
CONCLUDED
THAT
MAC
QUADRAS
SUFFER
FROM
TIMING
IRREGULARITIES
DEVIATING
FROM
THE
STANDARD
SCSI
SPECIFICATION
THIS
RESULTS
IN
SILENT
CORRUPTION
OF
DATA
WHEN
USED
WITH
SOME
DEVICES
INCLUDING
ULTRAMODERN
DEVICES
ALTHOUGH
I
WILL
NOT
NAME
THE
DEVICES
SINCE
IT
IS
NOT
THEIR
FAULT
AN
EXAMPLE
WOULD
BE
A
SONY
INCH
MO
WITHOUT
THE
SPECIAL
MACCOMPATIBLE
FIRMWARE
INSTALLED
ONE
SOLUTION
SOMETIMES
IS
TO
DISABLE
BLIND
WRITES
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
THERE
ARENT
ANY
PROBLEMS
WITH
QUADRAS
AND
BLIND
TRANSFERS
TROUBLE
WITH
BLIND
TRANSFERS
USUALLY
MEANS
THE
PROGRAMMER
SCREWED
UP
THE
TIBS
OR
DIDNT
TEST
THEIR
DRIVER
WITH
THE
DEVICE
IN
QUESTION
WELL
DESIGNED
TIBS
POLL
OR
LOOP
AT
EVERY
POINT
WHERE
DELAYS
OF
OCCUR
THIS
USUALLY
OCCURS
AT
THE
FIRST
BYTE
OF
EACH
BLOCK
OF
A
TRANSFER
BUT
SOME
DEVICES
CAN
HICCUP
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
BLOCKS
IF
THIS
HAPPENS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
BLIND
TRANSFER
THERE
IS
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
LOSING
OR
GAINING
A
BYTE
DEPENDING
ON
WHICH
DIRECTION
THE
TRANFER
WAS
GOING
IN
ANYCASE
THE
SCSI
MANAGER
WILL
EVENTUALLY
RETURN
A
PHASE
ERROR
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TRANSACTION
BECAUSE
IT
IS
OUT
OF
SYNC
ACTUAL
DATA
LOSS
WOULD
ONLY
OCCUR
IF
THE
DRIVER
DIDNT
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
THE
ERRORS
COMING
BACK
NOTE
THAT
THIS
EFFECT
IS
NOT
CAUSED
BY
ANYTHING
ACTUALLY
ON
THE
SCSI
BUS
BUT
RATHER
BY
THE
TRANSFER
LOOPS
INSIDE
THE
SCSI
MANAGER
THE
PROBLEM
OCCURS
WHEN
THE
PROCESSOR
BUS
ERRORS
TRYING
TO
ACCESS
THE
SCSI
CHIP
WHEN
THE
NEXT
BYTE
HASNT
BEEN
CLOCKED
YET
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
THE
BUS
ERROR
IS
DEALT
WITH
BY
A
BUS

DOESNT
