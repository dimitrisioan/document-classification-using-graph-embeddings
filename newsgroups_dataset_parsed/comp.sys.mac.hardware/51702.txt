MY
FRIEND
RECENTLY
PURCHASED
A
LC
III
AND
HE
WANTS
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
DEMON
CALLED
NUBUS
ADAPTER
FOR
HIS
PDS
SLOT
THE
LC
FAMILY
OF
MACS
CAN
ONLY
USE
PDS
CARDS
THEY
ARE
NOT
ABLE
TO
USE
NUBUS
AH
BUT
WHY
CAN
SOME
TECHNICALLYHIP
MACSLINGER
TELL
US
WHAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
BETWEEN
PDS
AND
NUBUS
IS
IT
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
MAKE
A
GADGET
THAT
PLUGS
INTO
PDS
AND
ENDS
IN
A
NUBUS
CARD
CAGE
AT
LEAST
MARVINS
FRIEND
HAS
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
LOCATE
ONE
AND
NEITHER
HAVE
I
WHAT
IS
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
REASON
FOR
THIS
I
THINK
THAT
THERE
DO
EXIST
NUBUS
EXPANSION
CAGES
IM
SURE
IVE
SEEN
THEM
ADVERTISED
OCCASSIONALLY
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THE
MAIN
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THEY
COST
MUCH
MORE
THAN
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
PRICE
BETWEEN
SAY
A
LC
AND
IIVX
SO
UNLESS
YOU
NEED
LOTS
OF
NUBUS
SLOTS
ITS
NOT
WORTH
THE
BOTHER
OF
COURSE
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THESE
EXTRA
BOXES
ARE
SO
EXPENSIVE
BECAUSE
NO
ONE
BUYS
THEM
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
SO
EXPENSIVE
NUBUS
TECHNOLOGY
ISNT
A
SPECIAL
APPLE
PROPRIETRY
THING
I
HAVE
THIS
SNEAKY
FEELING
THAT
IT
IS
LICENSED
FROM
TEXAS
INSTRUMENTS
SO
THERE
IS
NO
PROBLEM
BUILDING
AN
EXPANSION
BOX
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
NUBUS
AND
PDS
IS
THAT
NUBUS
IS
A
CLEVER
INTERFACE
WITH
LOTS
OF
NEAT
TOYS
BUILT
IN
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
LOTS
OF
CARDS
CAN
WORK
TOGETHER
ON
THE
SAME
COMPUTER
PDS
PROCESSOR
DIRECT
SLOT
IS
JUST
THAT
HERE
ARE
ALL
THE
CONNECTIONS
TO
THE
PROCESSOR
YOU
CAN
DO
ANYTHING
WITH
THIS
AND
IT
IS
AS
QUICK
AS
IT
CAN
BE
BUT
THERES
NO
COOPERATION
YOU
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
DOUBLE
PDS
SLOT
ADAPTORS
BUT
YOU
TRY
PLUGGING
VIDEO
CARDS
IN
AND
JUST
WATCH
THEM
CONFLICT
OF
COURSE
THE
EXTRA
ELECTRONICS
IN
A
NUBUS
SLOT
MAKES
IT
APPRECIABLY
MORE
EXPENSIVE
SO
GUESS
WHY
APPLE
DOESNT
PUT
IT
IN
ITS
CHEAPER
MACHINES
SO
YAH
PAYS
YER
MONEY
AND
YAH
TAKES
YAH
