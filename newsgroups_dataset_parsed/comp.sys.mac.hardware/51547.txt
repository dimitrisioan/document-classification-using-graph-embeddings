a
mirror
technologies
inch
mono
monitor
im
wondering
if
it
is
ok
to
set
the
monitor
on
top
of
the
cpu
the
monitor
weighs
lbs
ive
called
apple
the
person
i
spoke
with
was
not
sure
but
was
going
to
find
out
and
call
me
back
in
a
couple
of
days
that
was
over
a
week
ago
if
anybody
knows
please
respond
via
email
as
i

read

yea
thanks
to
lots
of
good
information
in
this
newsgroup
i
was
prepared
for
lots
of
details
even
shipping
time
got
my
in
weeks
i
guess
my
biggest
disappointment
is
the
lack
of
detail
in
the
written
specs
and
documentation
the
case
load
spec
is
an
example
the
setup
section
says
apple
and
monitors
can
go
on
top
but
and
other
big
ones
cant
why
couldnt
they
publish
a
maximum
load
now
if
i
can
figure
out
if
theres
any
hope
using
the
partition
button
on
the
hard
disk
setup
utility
do
i
dare
just
try
it
and
see
what
happens
then
maybe
i
can
divide
up
the
wealth
among
the
family
members
a
bit
more
securly
the
getting
more
information
section
of
the
manual
suggested
trying
other
avenues
before
calling
apple
but
didnt
mention
the
net
