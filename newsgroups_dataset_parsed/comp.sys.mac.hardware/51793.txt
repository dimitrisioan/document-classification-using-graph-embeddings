i
can
tell
you
that
there
is
no
way
for
a
graphics
card
to
know
what
resolution
its
connected
monitor
will
actually
support
thats
why
we
have
these
silly
cables
the
cable
just
identifies
that
monitor
as
supporting
a
given
resolution
therefore
the
software
will
support
any
multisync
monitor
ive
heard
that
radius
has
a
similar
program
for
the
quadra
is
this
software
available
either
commercially
or
public
domain
if
so
