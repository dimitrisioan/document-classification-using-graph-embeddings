ADDING
INT
HARD
DISK
DRIVE
TO
IICX
I
HAVENT
SEEN
MUCH
INFO
ABOUT
HOW
TO
ADD
AN
EXTRA
INTERNAL
DISK
TO
A
MAC
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TRY
IT
AND
I
WONDER
IF
SOMEONE
HAD
SOME
GOOD
ADVICE
WE
HAVE
A
MAC
IICX
WITH
THE
ORIGINAL
INTERNAL
QUANTUM
HARD
DISK
AND
AN
UNUSABLE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
WE
ALSO
HAVE
A
NEW
SPARE
CONNOR
DISK
WHICH
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
USE
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
REPLACE
THE
BROKEN
FLOPPY
DRIVE
WITH
THE
NEW
HARD
DISK
BUT
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
SOME
PROBLEMS
THE
INTERNAL
SCSI
CABLE
AND
POWER
CABLE
INSIDE
THE
CX
HAS
ONLY
CONNECTORS
FOR
ONE
SINGLE
HARD
DISK
DRIVE
IF
I
MADE
A
RIBBON
CABLE
AND
A
POWER
CABLE
WITH
THREE
CONNECTORS
EACH
FOR
MOTHERBOARD
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
DISKS
WOULD
IT
WORK
IS
THE
IICX
ABLE
TO
SUPPLY
THE
EXTRA
POWER
TO
THE
EXTRA
DISK
WHAT
ABOUT
TERMINATORS
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
I
SHOULD
REMOVE
THE
RESISTOR
PACKS
FROM
THE
DISK
THAT
IS
CLOSEST
TO
THE
MOTHERBOARD
BUT
LEAVE
THEM
INSTALLED
IN
THE
OTHER
DISK
THE
SCSI
ID
JUMPERS
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
CHANGED
SO
THAT
THE
NEW
DISK
GETS
ID
THE
OLD
ONE
SHOULD
HAVE
ID
IT
IS
NO
PROBLEM
FOR
US
TO
REMOVE
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
AS
WE
HAVE
AN
EXTERNAL
FLOPPY
THAT
WE
CAN
USE
IF
IT
WONT
BOOT
OF
THE
HARD
DISK
