EDWARD
M
TECOT
WRITES
A
PROFESSOR
OF
MINE
ONCE
SAID
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
COMPUTER
ENGINEER
AND
A
COMPUTER
SCIENTIST
IS
ABOUT
MEANING
THE
ENGINEER
MAKES
MORE
THAN
PS
THE
IS
NOT
JUST
A
JOKE
SCOTT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THIS
IS
A
BUNCH
OF
BUNK
IVE
GOT
A
COMPUTER
ENGINEERING
DEGREE
YET
IVE
SPENT
THE
LAST
YEARS
WRITING
SOFTWARE
THAT
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
USE
MOREOVER
THE
SALARY
DISTINCTIONS
ARE
INCORRECT
I
RECEIVED
JOB
OFFERS
UPON
GRADUATION
THE
TWO
JOBS
THAT
ACTUALLY
USED
MY
HARDWARE
EXPERIENCE
WERE
LOWER
MY
ADVICE
IS
TO
DECIDE
WHICH
CLASSES
AND
PROJECTS
MOST
INTEREST
YOU
AND
PICK
THE
MAJOR
THAT
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
TAKE
THEM
EMT
WELL
HERE
IS
MY
WORTH
ADVICE
FROM
A
GRAD
STUDENT
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
GENTLEMEN
WHO
WROTE
THE
COMMENT
BEFORE
ME
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
IS
PICK
WHAT
EVER
INTEREST
YOU
THE
MOST
AND
LEARN
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
ABOUT
IT
IN
MY
FIVE
YEARS
OF
EDUCATION
IN
THIS
FIELD
THOUGH
BRIEF
COMPARE
TO
ALOT
OF
PEOPLE
I
HAD
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
KIND
OF
QUESTION
A
LOT
DID
I
MAKE
THE
RIGHT
DECISION
IN
GOING
INTO
ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING
AS
OPPOSED
TO
COMPUTER
ENGINEERING
OR
CS
THE
MORE
I
GO
THRU
SCHOOL
THE
MORE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
KIND
OF
QUESTION
IS
IRRELEVANT
I
HAVE
COME
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
CHOOSING
CS
BECAUSE
ONE
DOES
NOT
LIKE
HARDWARE
OR
CHOOSING
HARDWARE
BECAUSE
ONE
DOES
NOT
LIKE
TO
PROGRAM
IS
REALLY
DOING
AN
INJUSTICE
OF
BUILDING
AND
COMPUTER
AND
MAKING
IT
USEFUL
FOR
SOMETHING
EVERYTHING
IS
INTERWOVEN
AND
INSEPARABLE
CS
CE
AND
EE
ARE
ALL
A
PART
OF
A
REALLY
GREAT
DISCIPLINE
AND
DO
DEPEND
ON
EACH
OTHER
MY
ADVICE
IS
DONT
LIMIT
YOURSELF
BUT
MAKE
A
DECISION
BASED
ON
WHICH
MAJOR
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THE
BEST
OPPORTUNITIES
TO
LEARN
THAT
OF
COURSE
DEPENDS
ON
THE
CURRICULUM
AT
YOUR
PERSECTIVE
SCHOOL
I
WOULD
CHOOSE
A
MAJOR
THAT
ALLOWS
ME
TO
EXPLORE
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
BESIDE
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
THE
SCHOOL
WOULD
MAKE
A
STUDENT
CHOOSE
A
MAJOR
BEFORE
HERHIS
SOPHAMORE
YEAR
HEY
YOU
MAY
BE
SO
INTERESTED
IN
THIS
FIELD
THAT
YOU
DECIDED
TO
LEARN
ALL
ABOUT
THE
MAKING
OF
COMPUTERS
IN
WHICH
CASE
YOU
SUFFER
A
LITTLE
MORE
AND
GO
TO
GRAD
SCHOOL
ABOUT
THE
MONEY
DONT
LOOK
AT
THE
AVERAGES
IF
YOU
ARE
GOOD
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
EARN
MORE
MONEY
THAN
ANYONE
ELSE
IF
YOU
ARE
A
SUPERSTAR
PROGRAMMER
YOU
WILL
EARN
MILLIONS
LIKE
WISE
IF
YOU
ARE
A
HOTSHOT
COMPUTER
DESIGNERS
