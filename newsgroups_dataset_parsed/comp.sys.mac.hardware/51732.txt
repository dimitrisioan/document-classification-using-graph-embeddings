WONT
GO
VERY
BIG

SUSPECT
AN
INTERNAL

ANOTHER
PROBLEM
IS
SUBBRIGHTNESS
AREAS
THAT
ARE
MEANT
TO
BE
BLACK
OR
OFF
THE
MAIN
RASTER
ARE
NOT
VERY
BLACK
THE
REAL
RASTER
IS
QUITE
VISIBLE
WHEN
THE
SCREEN
IS
BLANKED
THIS
IS
NOT
TOO
SEVERE
BUT
IT
IS
JUST
NOT
AS
GOOD
AS
OTHER
TRINI
SCREENS
I
HAVE
USED
IF
I
TURN
THE
BRIGHTNESSCONTRAST
DOWN
SO
THAT
THE
RASTER
IS
NOT
VISIBLE
THE
REAL
IMAGE
VIRTUALLY
DISAPPEARS
THE
RASTER
SIZE
IS
JUST
RIGHT
IF
I
USE

IS
A
BIT
TOO
MUCH
