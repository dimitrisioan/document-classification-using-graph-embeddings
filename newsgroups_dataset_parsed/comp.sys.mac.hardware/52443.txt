CENTRIS
FLAKY

JAY
SCOTT
WRITES
A
REP
AT
THE
DEALER
ACTUALLY
ITS
A
UNIVERSITY
ORDER
CENTER
SO
THEY
DONT
HAVE
ANY
IMMEDIATE
FINANCIAL
INTEREST
TOLD
ME
THAT
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
HAVING
LOTS
OF
PROBLEMS
WITH
THEIR
CENTRIS
HE
DIDNT
GO
INTO
DETAILS
BUT
MENTIONED
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
AND
INTERMITTENT
PROBLEMS
WITH
PRINTING
FILES
IT
SOUNDED
TO
ME
LIKE
THEY
WERE
HAVING
BOTH
HARDWARE
PROBLEMS
AND
SOFTWARE
COMPATIBILITY
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
MACHINE
HES
NOT
RECOMMENDING
THE
CENTRIS
TO
ANYBODY
HE
SAYS
TO
CONSIDER
A
CENTRIS
OR
A
IIVX
WHY
HE
WOULD
RECOMMEND
A
IIVX
OVER
AN
LCIII
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
THATS
WHAT
HE
SAID
SO
WHAT
DOES
THE
NET
THINK
DID
THE
DEALER
JUST
GET
ONE
FLAKY
MACHINE
OR
DID
APPLE
SEND
THE
OUT
THE
DOOR
TOO
EARLY
IS
YOUR
WORKING
JUST
GREAT
OR
IS
IT
BUGGY
TOO
JAY
SCOTT
SCOTTCSUIUCEDU
SOUNDS
TO
ME
LIKE
YOUR
DEALER
REALLY
WANTS
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
IIVXS
HE
HAS
IN
STOCK
I
CAN
IMAGING
THAT
THEY
ARE
GETTING
HARD
TO
SELL
GIVEN
THAT
A
IS
WAY
FASTER
AND
IS
COMPARABLE
IN
PRICE
AN
LCIII
IS
ABOUT
THE
SAME
SPEED
AND
IS
WAY
CHEAPER
SO
YOUR
DEALER
MAY
WELL
BE
TRYING
AS
HARD
AS
HE
CAN
TO
CONVINCE
PEOPLE
THAT
IIVXS
ARE
A
MUCH
BETTER
BUY
THAN
A
JUST
SO
HE
CAN
GET
RID
OF
ALL
HIS
OLD
STOCK
NO
DISRESPECT
TO
DEALERS
OR
THE
IIVX
