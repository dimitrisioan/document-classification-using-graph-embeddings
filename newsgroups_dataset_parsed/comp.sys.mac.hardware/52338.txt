RE
GOOD
APS
EXPERIENCE
I
THOUGHT
ID
SHARE
A
GOOD
EXPERIENCE
TOO
I
BOUGHT
THE
APS
QUANTUM
ZERO
FOOTPRINT
DRIVE
IN
MAY
BACK
WHEN
THEY
STILL
USED
TWO
SEPARATE
LEDS
ON
THE
FRONT
PANEL
AND
THE
CASE
WAS
METAL
WHILE
TRAVELING
WITH
IT
IT
WAS
IN
MY
MAC
BAG
ON
TOP
OF
THE
MAC
THIS
PAST
WINTER
ONE
OF
THE
PLASTIC
TABS
HOLDING
THE
FRONT
PANEL
ON
BROKE
SO
THAT
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
OF
THE
FRONT
PANEL
WAS
COMING
FORWARD
AWAY
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
DRIVE
I
LIVED
WITH
THIS
SITUATION
UNTIL
IT
BECAME
COMPLETELY
INTOLERABLE
WHICH
MORE
OR
LESS
COINCIDED
WITH
A
NETWORK
SHUTDOWN
AT
SCHOOL
AND
A
TRIP
OUT
OF
TOWN
I
HAD
TO
TAKE
WHICH
GAVE
ME
SOME
DEAD
TIME
DURING
WHICH
TO
HAVE
THE
DRIVE
SENT
OUT
I
CALLED
APS
FOR
AN
RMA
AND
GOT
ONE
WITH
NO
QUESTIONS
ASKED
ABOUT
HOW
THE
TAB
GOT
BROKEN
IT
WAS
HANDLED
A
LITTLE
ROUGHLY
BY
AIRLINE
BAGGAGE
HANDLERS
THOUGH
NOTHING
ELSE
WAS
DAMAGED
WELL
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
INTERNAL
SPEAKER
IN
MY
MODEM
WHICH
WASNT
THAT
WELL
GLUED
DOWN
TO
BEGIN
WITH
YEAH
YEAH
IM
NEVER
FLYING
WITH
MY
AGAIN
AND
WHEN
I
CALLED
BACK
TO
ASK
WHETHER
I
COULD
SEND
IT
IN
A
LITTLE
LATER
RATHER
THAN
RIGHT
AWAY
THEY
HAD
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THAT
EVEN
WHEN
I
EXCEEDED
THE
NORMAL
VALID
PERIOD
FOR
AN
RMA
BY
A
DAY
THEYRE
USUALLY
GOOD
FOR
DAYS
THE
FRONT
PANEL
WAS
REPLACED
UNDER
WARRANTY
AND
THE
DRIVE
WAS
SHIPPED
BACK
QUICKLY
I
MAILED
IT
FIRST
CLASS
INSURED
ON
A
SATURDAY
BY
NOON
FROM
LA
TO
MISSOURI
AND
IT
CAME
BACK
BY
FED
EX
BY
FRIDAY
I
DONT
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
DAY
IT
CAME
BACK
BECAUSE
I
WAS
TRAVELING
THAT
WEEK
FROM
WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON
TO
SUNDAY
AFTERNOON
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
COULDVE
BEEN
BAD
WAS
THAT
THE
FIRST
SERVICE
REP
I
TALKED
TO
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
PREVENT
JEOPARDIZING
MY
DATA
SUGGESTED
THAT
I
TAKE
THE
DRIVE
MECHANISM
OUT
AND
SEND
JUST
THE
CASE
UNFORTUNATELY
I
DISCOVERED
THE
DAY
I
WAS
MAILING
THE
THING
THAT
WOULD
NECESSITATE
BREAKING
THE
LITTLE
SEAL
AND
THUS
VOIDING
THE
WARRANTY

WELL
