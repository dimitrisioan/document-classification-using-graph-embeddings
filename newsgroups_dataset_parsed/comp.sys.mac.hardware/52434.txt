ARTICLE
CHRISTOPHER
BRUCE
KIDWELL
WRITES
I
ORDERED
AN
EXTERNAL
FLOPPY
DRIVE
FROM
THEM
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
I
PLACED
THE
ORDER
THEY
SAID
IT
WAS
IN
STOCK
AND
WOULD
SHIP
THE
NEXT
DAY
A
WEEK
PASSED
AND
NO
DRIVE
I
CALLED
THEM
UP
AND
THEY
SAID
THEY
WERE
OUT
OF
STOCK
AND
MY
DRIVE
SHOULD
SHIP
IN
WEEKS
OR
SO
SINCE
I
NEEDED
THE
DRIVE
RIGHT
AWAY
BOTH
MY
INTERNAL
HARD
DRIVE
AND
FLOPPY
WERE
DEAD
I
CANCELLED
MY
ORDER
AND
HAVENT
DEALT
WITH
THEM
SINCE
CHRIS
KIDWELL
I
TOO
HAD
A
VERY
UNPLEASANT
EXPERIENCE
WITH
HARDWARE
THATS
SHI
IT
FEATURED
REPEATED
LIES
ABOUT
WHEN
THINGS
HAD
SHIPPED
A
SALESPERSON
WHO
WAS
TOTALLY
IGNORANT
ABOUT
WHAT
HE
WAS
SELLING
A
CHARGE
FOR
DUTIES
I
HAD
SPECIFICALLY
BEEN
ASSURED
WERE
NOT
PAYABLE
AND
THEN
A
MONITOR
THEIR
HOUSE
BRAND
MONOCHROME
THAT
WAS
THE
MOST
UNADULTERATED
PIECE
OF
JUNK
IT
HAS
EVER
BEEN
MY
MISFORTUNE
TO
EXPERIENCE
IN
THE
WORLD
OF
ELECTRONICS
I
SHIPPED
IT
BACK
AND
THEY
REFUNDED
MY
MONEY
BUT
IT
STILL
COST
ME
SOMETHING
OVER
FOR
LONG
DISTANCE
CHARGES
NONREFUNDABLE
TAXES
AND
DUTIES
AND
LOST
TIME
DONT
DEAL
WITH
THEM
