followup
my
recently
modified
quadra
with
a
socket
for
clock
oscillators
has
now
completed
nearly
hours
of
error
free
operation
at
mhz
with
a
mhz
clock
oscillator
i
have
also
tried
a
mhz
cmos
clock
and
that
works
as
well
on
the
more
stupid
side
ive
discovered
you
can
use
a
mhz
clock
and
make
your
as
slow
as
a
centris
however
a
mhz
clock
which
would
have
yielded
a
mhz
quadra
whod
want
one
didnt
work
at
all
impatiently
awaiting
a
mhz
clock
