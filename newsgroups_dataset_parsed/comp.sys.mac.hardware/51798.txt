using
appletalk
and
phonenet
connectors
to
chat
we
use
a
program
called
broadcast
with
it
we
can
send
brief
messages
to
all
or
selected
machines
within
the
network
if
you
use
system
you
can
use
my
application
zing
which
has
a
kb
footprint
meaning
you
can
have
it
running
all
the
time
without
losing
memory
it
is
also
compatible
with
the
chat
program
fishbomb
which
allows
sounds
and
pictures
as
well
both
are
as
far
as
i
know
freeware
i
dustribute
