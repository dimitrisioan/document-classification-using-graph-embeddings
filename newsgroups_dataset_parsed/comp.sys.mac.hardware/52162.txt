WRITES
WHAT
IS
THE
REAL
STORY
HERE
CAN
I
HOOK
UP
ANY
PC
SVGA
MONTITOR
TO
THE
CENTRIS
INTERNAL
VIDEO
DO
I
NEED
TO
MAKE
MY
OWN
CABLE
IF
IT
DOESNT
NOT
COME
WITH
ONE
HAS
APPLE
RELEASED
A
TECH
NOTE
WITH
THE
PINOUTS
FOR
DOING
SUCH
THE
REASOJ
I
ASK
IS
THAT
IT
SEEMS
THE
PRICES
FOR
SVGA
ARE
LOWER
THAN
THAT
OF
THEIR
MAC
COUNTERPARTS
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
WOULDNT
ADVISE
WASTING
YOUR
TIME
WITH
APPLE
THEYLL
TREAT
YOU
LIKE
AN
IDIOT
AND
YOU
WONT
GET
ANY
ANSWERS
A
PERSONAL
OPINION
THE
SAFEST
THING
TO
DO
IS
MATCH
THE
SVGA
MONITORS
SCANNING
RATES
WITH
APPLES
RATES
I
DONT
KNOW
APPLES
VIDEO
SCANNING
RATES
BUT
I
USE
THE
MICRON
XCEED
RATES
AS
THEYRE
A
GOOD
APPROXIMATION
ABOUT
CABLES
YOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
GO
OUT
TO
SOMEPLACE
LIKE
FRYS
AND
GET
A
FEW
MACVGA
CABLES
AND
TRY
THEM
OUT
I
HAVE
A
VIEWSONIC
AND
I
USE
AN
NEC
ADAPTOR
OTHER
MONITORS
MAY
USE
OTHER
ADAPTORS
I
ALSO
HAVE
A
ADAPTOR
THAT
TRICKS
SYSTEM
INTO
THINKING
THE
MONITOR
IS
AN
APPLE
I
NEED
TO
READJUST
THE
VERTICAL
AND
HORIZONTAL
SIZES
BUT
IT
WORKS
FAIRLY
WELL
JUST
LIKE
EVERYTHING
ELSE
IN
LIFE
THE
RIGHT
LANE
ENDS
IN
HALF
