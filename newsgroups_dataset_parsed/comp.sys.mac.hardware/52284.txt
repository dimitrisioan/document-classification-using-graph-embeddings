psi
modem
problem
ii
the
first
problem
was
the
sound
i
tried
the
but
then
even
the
logon
was
muted
i
dont
want
that
any
other
suggestions
for
that
hissing
the
second
is
really
strange
first
i
kept
mentioning
that
fc
slowed
down
all
the
time
and
took
too
long
well
i
just
logged
on
with
extensions
off
and
i
didnt
have
any
slowdown
also
last
time
i
was
online
i
quit
which
usually
disconnects
and
quits
it
disconnected
but
it
wouldnt
quit
i
had
to
force
quit
and
then
when
i
launched
fc
again
it
said
the
modem
port
was
in
use
this
is
really
strange
i
thought
it
might
have
to
do
with
fax
software
or
the
restart
could
have
reset
the
modem
port
a
more
likely
explanation
so
any
suggestions
