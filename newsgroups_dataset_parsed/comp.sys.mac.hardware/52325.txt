hi
do
any
of
you
hardware
gurus
out
there
know
what
kind
of
memory
architecture
apple
uses
in
the
powerbook
duos
or
in
the
powerbook
in
general
what
are
the
factors
that
make
the
duo
so
slow
compared
to
a
desktop
machine
running
the
same
processor
at
the
same
speed
how
many
wait
states
are
in
the
memory
system
etc
what
kind
of
a
data
bus
does
it
use
or
huh
where
did
you
get
this
idea
from
i
think
you
got
this
backwards
the
duos
memory
is
faster
than
its
equivalent
desktop
machine
by
and
the
rest
of
the
powerboks
i
think
the
explanation
for
this
was
that
it
can
refresh
faster
in
instead
of
cycles
i
believe
things
that
could
affect
performance
would
be
factors
such
as
use
of
functions
enhanced
in
the
fpu
which
the
duo
doesnt
have
undocked
extensions
and
background
applications
can
slow
your
computer
down
too
real
life
differences
in
speed
are
likely
to
be
influence
by
the
software
you
are
running
what
kind
of
screen
depth
you
are
running
etc
espen
ps
the
duo
is
throughout
thanks
for
the
enlightening
post
is
there
a
technical
note
on
this
the
desktop
machine
i
was
referring
to
was
actually
not
a
mac
but
rather
any
of
various
workstations
that
use
the
such
as
old
suns
or
old
nexts
i
used
to
own
a
next
cube
but
i
will
try
rebooting
without
extensions
to
see
what
kind
of
a
speed
difference
i
get
with
my
powerbook
duo
i
did
notice
an
extreme
slowdown
to
unusability
with
a
mac
plus
after
installing
system
on
it
why
does
the
os
suck
up
so
much
cpu
power
also
youre
rightsoftware
does
make
a
huge
difference
i
have
the
misfortune
of
using
msworks
on
my
duo
when
editing
relatively
small
files
cut
or
copy
takes
several
seconds
often
more
than
seconds
this
happens
with
power
cycling
turned
off
as
usual
ms
software
is
maggotinfested
feces
im
getting
nisus
to
replace
it
for
my
text
editing
avery
