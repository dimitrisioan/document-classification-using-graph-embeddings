HI
THERE
I
HAVE
A
MAC
LC
AND
CONSIDER
BUYING
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
DOUBLE
SPEED
OF
IS
ACHIEVABLE
ONLY
ON
MACHINES
WITH
THE
DOUBLE
SPEED
IS
A
PREREQUISITE
FOR
PHOTOCD
MULTISESSION
CAPABILITY
WHICH
I
NEED
WHICH
MEANS
I
SEEM
TO
GAIN
NOTHING
COMPARED
WITH
SAY
ANY
COMMENTS
THANX
YOUR
SOURCE
IS
WRONG
THE
DOUBLE
SPEED
IS
STILL
SLOW
COMPARED
TO
A
TYPICAL
HARD
DISK
THE
LC
CAN
EASILY
HANDLE
THE
SCSI
TRANSFER
RATE
OF
THE
NONE
OF
THE
CURRENT
MACS
EVEN
THE
QUADRAS
SUPPORT
UNLESS
YOU
GET
A
NUBUS
CARD
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
HAVE
DOUBLE
SPEED
TO
USE
PHOTOCD
ITS
JUST
FASTER
READING
IMAGES
OFF
OF
A
DISK
I
THINK
THAT
THE
CAN
HANDLE
PHOTOCD
BUT
ONLY
SINGLE
SESSION
THE
CAN
DO
MULTISESSION
PHOTOCD
