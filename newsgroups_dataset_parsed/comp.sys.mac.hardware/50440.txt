DISAPPOINTED
BY
LA
CIE
APPROXIMATELY
FOUR
MONTHS
AGO
I
PURCHASED
A
QUANTUM
HD
FROM
LA
CIE
FOR
AFTER
TWO
MONTHS
THE
DRIVE
STARTED
HAVING
PROBLEMS
FIRST
THERE
WERE
INTERMITTENT
FREEZES
THEN
CORRUPTED
FILES
AND
RESOURCES
THEN
SILVERLINING
WOULDNT
EVEN
RECOGNIZE
THE
DRIVE
SO
I
GOT
AN
RMA
FROM
LA
CIE
AND
EXCHANGED
THE
NEW
DRIVE
FOR
A
RECONDITIONED
ONE
WELL
ABOUT
A
MONTH
HAS
PASSED
NOW
AND
THE
SECOND
DRIVE
IS
HAVING
PROBLEMS
OFTEN
WHEN
I
BOOT
UP
MY
IISI
I
GET
THE
FLASHING
QUESTION
MARK
SOMETIMES
IF
I
THEN
INSERT
THE
SILVERLINING
PROGRAM
I
CAN
GET
IT
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
DRIVE
BY
MAKING
IT
SCAN
OVER
AND
OVER
FOR
DRIVES
AT
THAT
POINT
I
CAN
RESTART
THE
IISI
AND
BOOT
FROM
THE
HD
IVE
CALLED
LA
CIE
AGAIN
AND
THEYVE
GIVEN
ME
ANOTHER
RMA
THEIR
TECH
SUPPORT
PEOPLE
TELL
ME
THAT
IF
SILVERLINING
DOESNT
SEE
THE
DRIVE
THERES
A
DEFINITE
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
GIVEN
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
SECOND
BAD
DRIVE
IN
FOUR
MONTHS
I
ASKED
LA
CIE
TO
SEND
ME
A
NEW
ONE
BUT
THEY
SAID
NO
ALSO
WITHIN
THREE
WEEKS
AFTER
I
PURCHASED
MY
ORIGINAL
DRIVE
LA
CIE
DROPPED
THE
PRICE
ON
IT
BY
OVER
I
CAN
ACCEPT
THAT
A
DRIVE
OR
TWO
MAY
BE
BAD
AND
I
KNOW
THAT
HARDWARE
VENDORS
MAKE
A
PRACTICE
OF
SENDING
RECONDITIONED
REPLACEMENTS
WHEN
THEY
DO
REPAIRS
AND
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
COMPUTER
INDUSTRY
LENDS
ITSELF
TO
SUDDEN
PRICE
FLUCTUATIONS
NEVERTHELESS
TAKEN
TOGETHER
THE
CONVERGENCE
OF
THESE
FACTSEVENTS
HAVE
LEFT
A
BAD
TASTE
IN
MY
MOUTH
I
SHOULD
HAVE
ADDED
ABOVE
THAT
WHEN
I
ASKED
LA
CIE
TO
TRANSFER
THE
CONTENTS
OF
MY
CURRENT
DRIVE
TO
THE
ONE
THEY
WILL
SENDI
THINK
THE
DATA
IS
STILL
IN
GOOD
SHAPE
AND
ILL
HAVE
TO
AGAIN
REINSTALL
EVERYTHING
FROM
FLOPPIESTHEY
SAID
IT
WOULD
COST
ME
FOR
DATA
RECOVERY
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
RECONDITIONED
HARDWARE
SHOULD
BE
SOLD
AS
RECONDITIONED
AT
A
DISCOUNTED
PRICE
AND
THAT
REPLACEMENTS
FOR
NEW
HARDWARE
GONE
BAD
STILL
COVERED
UNDER
A
WARRANTY
SHOULD
BE
NEW
I
FEEL
A
LITTLE
HELPLESS
ABOUT
ALL
THIS
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
NECESSARILY
FLAME
LA
CIETHEIR
SUPPORT
STAFF
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
FRIENDLY
AND
SOMETIMES
EVEN
HELPFUL
BUT
CMON
SOMETIMES
A
LITTLE
EXTRA
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
GOES
A
LONG
WAY
I
SENT
A
LETTER
TO
LA
CIES
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
WHEN
THE
FIRST
DRIVE
WAS
RETURNED
AND
I
ASKED
THEM
FOR
A
CREDIT
ON
THE
PRICE
DIFFERENCE
SINCE
I
HAD
PURCHASED
THE
DRIVE
THREE
WEEKS
BEFORE
THEY
SLASHED
THE
PRICE
I
TOLD
THEM
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
APPLY
THE
CREDIT
TOWARD
THE
PURCHASE
OF
ANOTHER
LA
CIE
PRODUCT
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
HAVE
THE
COURTESY
TO
REPLY
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
WHATS
THE
MORAL
OF
THIS
STORY
IM
NOT
SURE
BUT
I
DO
KNOW
I
WONT
BUY
ANY
OTHER
PRODUCTS
FROM
LA
CIE
IN
THE
FUTURE
