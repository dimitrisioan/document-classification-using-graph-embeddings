RE
HOW
DO
THEY
COMPARE
I
GUESS
THE
REAL
QUESTION
IS
WHO
ASKED
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTIONS
AND
WHY
WAS
IT
SO
BROAD
ARE
WE
TALKING
PURE
PROCESSING
POWER
WHAT
KIND
OF
PROCESSING
BTW
ISOLATED
FROM
EVERY
OTHER
FACTOR
AND
INFLUENCE
IN
THE
SYSTEM
OR
ARE
WE
SHOPPING
FOR
A
HOME
COMPUTER
BASED
ON
THE
CPU
SPECS
YUCK
I
JUST
FINISHED
A
PROJECT
THAT
INVOLVES
REALTIME
PROCESSING
OF
SERIAL
DATA
AND
DISCOVERED
THAT
THE
PROGRAMMING
INTERFACE
ASSEMBLY
HAS
A
LOT
TO
DO
WITH
THE
POWER
OF
A
CPU
IN
A
PARTICULAR
APPLICATION
IF
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
IS
EASY
TO
CODE
WITH
THE
INSTRUCTION
SET
GIVEN
THEN
NOT
ONLY
IS
IT
EASY
BUT
ITS
CHEAP
AND
QUICK
IF
YOU
HAVE
TO
FAKE
THINGS
LIKE
RESOLVING
INDIRECTION
WITHOUT
A
LEA
INSTRUCTION
THEN
YOUR
CYCLE
COUNT
GOES
THROUGH
THE
ROOF
WELL
LETS
NOT
START
A
FLAME
WAR
ABOUT
WHOSE
COMPUTER
IS
BETTER
THAN
WHOSE
THE
ORGINAL
QUESTION
WAS
ABOUT
CLASSIFYING
MICROPROCESSORS
HAVING
REREAD
THE
ENTIRE
THREAD
I
DONT
THINK
MUCH
MORE
CAN
BE
SAID
WITHOUT
GETTING
DOWN
INTO
SPECIFIC
PROPOSED
SYSTEMS
WITH
IMPORTANT
DETAILS
GIVEN
THATS
IT
FOR
ANOTHER
CHEERS

A
NICE
DAY
ANYWAY
