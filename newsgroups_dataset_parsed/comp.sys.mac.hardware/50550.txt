MEANS
NEVER
BEING
ALONE
WRITES
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
TO
OPEN
UP
THE
APPLE
ERGOMOUSE
ADB
MOUSE
II
MINE
LIVES
NEAR
A
CAT
TRUE
REALLY
AND
PICKS
UP
HER
FUR
FROM
WHAT
I
CAN
TELL
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
APPLE
WELDED
IT
SHUT
YOU
MUST
NOT
HAVE
TRIED
VERY
HARD
I
JUST
OPEND
MINE
IN
ABOUT
SECONDS
TAKE
A
LOOK
ON
THE
BOTTOM
IT
HAS
A
DIAL
THAT
TURNS
TO
OPEN
MUCH
LIKE
THE
OLDER
ADB
MOUSES
USED
TO
HAVE
ITS
A
BIT
HARDER
TO
TURN
AT
FIRST
BUT
IT
IS
QUITE
SIMPLE
TO
OPEN
NOPE
IM
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
THIS
PERSON
KNOWS
HOW
TO
TAKE
THE
BALL
OUT
I
THINK
THAT
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
DO
IS
TAKE
THE
MOUSE
APART
THE
OLD
MOUSE
HAD
FOUR
SCREWS
ON
THE
BOTTOM
THAT
YOU
COULD
UNSCREW
TO
DO
THIS
WHILE
THERES
NO
OBVIOUS
WAY
TO
TAKE
THE
NEW
ONE
APART
