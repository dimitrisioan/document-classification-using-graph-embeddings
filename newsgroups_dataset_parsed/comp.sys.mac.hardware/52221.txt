BREDELL
WRITES
IT
WAS
A
PAPER
FROM
APPLE
SWEDEN
THAT
ANNOUNCED
SOME
NEW
PRODUCTS
THE
NEW
DOCKING
STATION
WAS
ONLY
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
THE
PAPER
ARRIVED
BEFORE
IT
SHOWED
UP
ON
THE
PRICE
LIST
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
ITS
STILL
CALLED
THE
DUODOCK
PLUS
IN
THE
PRICE
LIST
IT
COULD
BE
A
MISTAKE
BY
SOMEONE
AT
APPLE
SWEDEN
AH
OK
I
DIDNT
REALIZE
THAT
YOU
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
AN
APPLE
DIVISION
OTHER
THAN
APPLEUS
APPLEUS
BEING
THE
MAIN
DIVISION
IS
THE
ONE
THAT
CONTAINS
WHAT
MOST
PEOPLE
FEEL
ARE
THE
CORRECT
NAMES
AND
CONFIGURATIONS
FOR
THE
MAJORITY
OF
APPLE
CUSTOMERS
AND
IT
IS
GENERALLY
ASSUMED
THAT
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
APPLEUS
WHEN
YOU
JUST
SAY
APPLE
AT
LEAST
THATS
HOW
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
ALL
OTHER
APPLE
DIVISIONS
ARE
APPARANTLY
FREE
TO
CHANGE
NAMES
AND
CONFIGURATIONS
IF
THEY
FEEL
LIKE
IT
I
KNOW
THAT
APPLE
CANADA
DOES
THIS
KIND
OF
STUFF
ALL
THE
TIME
ITS
NOT
A
MISTAKE
ITS
APPLE
SWEDEN
GIVING
A
DIFFERENT
NAME
TO
AN
APPLE
PRODUCT
OTHER
THAN
WHAT
APPLEUS
CALLS
IT
HADES
