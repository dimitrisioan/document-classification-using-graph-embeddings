FINE
BUT
WHATEVER

I
GET
MUST
FIT
THE
FOLLOWING
REQUIRED
FEATURES

FOR
ME
AND
ALWAYS
WILL
BE
COLOR
I
KNOW
ABOUT
FREEDOM
OF
PRESS
BUT
IVE
ALSO
HEARD
THAT
ITS
PAINFULLY
SLOW
I
CAN
TOLERATE
ABOUT
PPM
BUT
ANYTHING
SLOWER
THAN
THAT
AND
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
CONSIDER
THE
PRICE
SAVINGS
WORTH
IT
ID
BE
CURIOUS
TO
HEAR
PEOPLES
EXPERIENCE
WITH
IT
THO
I
ALSO
INFINITELY
PREFER
LASER
OVER
INK

READABLE
PRINTERS
