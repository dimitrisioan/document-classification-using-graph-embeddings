POWERPC
NUBUS
RUMORS
I
READ
IN
MACWEEK
THAT
SOME
DEVELOPERS
ARE
GETTING
NUBUS
CARDS
FROM
APPLE
WITH
PRERELEASE
POWERPC
CHIPS
ON
THEM
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
WHEN
THE
CHIP
IS
RELEASED
THOSE
OF
US
WITH
OLD
APPLES
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
POWERPC
RISC
TECHNOLOGY
JUST
BY
INSERTING
A
CARD
I
DONT
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HARDWARE
SO
CAN
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
HOW
MUCH
OF
A
CLUDGE
THIS
WOULD
BE
ARCHON
