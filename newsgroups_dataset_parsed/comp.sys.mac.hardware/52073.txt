PB
AND
EXTENDED
KEYBOARD
HELLO
I
SAW
THIS
QUESTION
POSTED
A
WEEK
OR
SO
AGO
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
I
COULD
TELL
NO
ANSWER
APPEARED
ON
THE
NET
WHAT
IS
THE
GOOD
OIL
ON
CONNECTING
THE
APPLE
EXTENDED
KEYBOARD
TO
A
POWERBOOK
THE
EARLIER
QUESTIONER
WONDERD
IF
THIS
WOULD
BE
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
LOAD
FOR
THE
PB
AND
AS
I
WANT
TO
CONNECT
JUST
SUCH
A
BEAST
I
AM
CURIOUS
I
HAVENT
GOT
A
PB
YET
SO
I
CANT
RTFM
BUT
I
ASSUME
THAT
A
STANDARD
KEYBOARD
WITH
A
MOUSE
WOULD
BE
OK
AS
THE
SPEC
SHEET
I
READ
MENTIONED
CONNECTING
AN
EXTERNAL
KEYBOARD
BUT
IS
THE
EXTENDED
PLUS
MOUSE
PUSHING
IT
ANY
HELP
GRATEFULLY
RECIEVED
I
WILL
SUMMARISE
TO
THE
NET
IF
NECESSARY
THANKS
JOHN
COLLINS
PS
I
AM
THINKING
OF
A
BUT
I
ASSUME
THAT
THIS
WOULD
APPLY
TO
ALL
PBS
