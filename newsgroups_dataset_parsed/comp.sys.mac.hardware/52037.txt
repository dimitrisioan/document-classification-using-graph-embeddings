FIX
I
POSTED
ON
HERE
ABOUT
A
PROBLEM
WITH
A
DATADESK
KEYBOARD
THAT
FAILED
TO
REBUILD
THE
DESKTOP
WITH
THE
COMMANDOPTION
KEYS
PRESSED
OR
TO
SHUT
OFF
INITS
WHEN
PRESSING
THE
SHIFT
KEY
AFTER
ABSOLUTELY
NO
HELP
FROM
DATADESK
I
CALLED
MACCONNECTION
TECH
SUPPORT
THEY
TRIED
IT
OUT
ON
THEIR
CENTRIS
AND
HAD
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
THEY
IMMEDIATELY
OFFERED
TO
GET
A
NEW
KEYBOARD
TRY
IT
ON
THEIR
CENTRIS
AND
SHIP
IT
TO
ME
OVERNIGHT
IF
IT
WORKED
I
COULD
SEND
THEM
MY
KEYBOARD
BACK
AFTER
I
GOT
THE
ONE
THAT
WORKED
THIS
IS
FROM
A
GUY
IN
TECH
SUPPORT
NAMED
DAVE
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
THE
KEYBOARD
WILL
WROK
IF
YOU
WAIT
FOR
THE
SMILEY
FACE
BEFORE
PRESSING
THE
SHIFT
KEY
TO
DISABLE
INITS
AND
WAIT
FOR
THE
INITS
TO
START
APPEARING
TO
REBUILD
THE
DESKTOP
BY
PRESSING
COMMANDOPTION
I
REALLY
LIKE
THIS
KEYBOARD
SO
I
WAS
GLAD
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
KEEP
IT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
DATADESKS
TECH
SUPPORT
SUCKS
WHILE
MACCONNECTIONS
IS
GREAT
TERRY
