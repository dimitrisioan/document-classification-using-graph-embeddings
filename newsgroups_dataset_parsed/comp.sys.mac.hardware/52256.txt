DO
ANY
OF
YOU
HARDWARE
GURUS
OUT
THERE
KNOW
WHAT
KIND
OF
MEMORY
ARCHITECTURE
APPLE
USES
IN
THE
POWERBOOK
DUOS
OR
IN
THE
POWERBOOK
IN
GENERAL
WHAT
ARE
THE
FACTORS
THAT
MAKE
THE
DUO
SO
SLOW
COMPARED
TO
A
DESKTOP
MACHINE
RUNNING
THE
SAME
PROCESSOR
AT
THE
SAME
SPEED
HOW
MANY
WAIT
STATES
ARE
IN
THE
MEMORY
SYSTEM
ETC
WHAT
KIND
OF
A

BUS
DOES
IT
USE
OR
HUH
WHERE
DID
YOU
GET
THIS
IDEA
FROM
I
THINK
YOU
GOT
THIS
BACKWARDS
THE
DUOS
MEMORY
IS
FASTER
THAN
ITS
EQUIVALENT
DESKTOP
MACHINE
BY
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
POWERBOKS
I
THINK
THE
EXPLANATION
FOR
THIS
WAS
THAT
IT
CAN
REFRESH
FASTER
IN
INSTEAD
OF
CYCLES
I
BELIEVE
THINGS
THAT
COULD
AFFECT
PERFORMANCE
WOULD
BE
FACTORS
SUCH
AS
USE
OF
FUNCTIONS
ENHANCED
IN
THE
FPU
WHICH
THE
DUO
DOESNT
HAVE
UNDOCKED
EXTENSIONS
AND
BACKGROUND
APPLICATIONS
CAN
SLOW
YOUR
COMPUTER
DOWN
TOO
REAL
LIFE
DIFFERENCES
IN
SPEED
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
INFLUENCE
BY
THE
SOFTWARE
YOU
ARE
RUNNING
WHAT
KIND

YOU
ARE

THE
DUO
IS
THROUGHOUT
