tones
o
death
hi
i
just
test
installed
kanjitalk
on
my
iici
and
got
a
black
screen
a
way
sick
looking
mac
icon
and
when
hitting
the
programmers
reset
a
tone
sequence
that
i
guess
is
the
infamous
tones
of
death
i
was
able
to
reboot
off
a
floppy
removed
the
japanese
system
and
set
up
the
system
folder
on
the
hard
drive
to
get
system
back
now
have
no
overt
problems
with
the
mac
any
idea
what
caused
the
tones
i
forget
the
numbers
but
comes
to
mind
if
it
is
some
self
diagnostic
why
would
an
older
system
version
catch
it
and
not
ill
be
moving
up
to
and
worldscript
byandby
thanks
in
advance
