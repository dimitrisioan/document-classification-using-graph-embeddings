CAN
SOME
PEOPLE
WITH
CACHE
CARDS
PLEASE
POST
SPEEDOMETER
NUMBERS
THEY
GET
WITH
THE
CARDS
I
HAVE
ONLY
ONE
REPORT
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
INDICATE
THAT
A
CACHE
CARD
GIVES
YOU
ONLY
ABOUT
A
SPEEDUP
OK
I
HAVE
A
RECORD
THAT
SHOWS
A
IISI
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
A
CACHE
ITS
SMALL
ENOUGH
THAT
I
WILL
ATTACH
IT
I
HAVE
ALSO
MEASURED
SOME
REAL
PROGRAMS
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
THE
KB
CACHE
THE
SPEEDUP
VARIES
A
LOT
FROM
APP
TO
APP
RANGING
FROM

I
THINK
AN
AVERAGE
OF
IS
ABOUT
RIGHT
THE
SUBJECTIVE
DIFFERENCE
IS
NOT
GREAT
BUT
IS
SOMETIMES
NOTICABLE
A
SIMPLE
CACHE
CARD
CERTAINLY
DOES
NOT
TRANSFORM
A
IISI
INTO
SOMETHING
ENORMOUSLY
BETTER
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
AN
FPU
THE
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
SAYS
THAT
CACHE
CARDS
FROM
ALL
OF
THE
MAKERS
OFFER
ABOUT
THE
SAME
SPEEDUP
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
NOT
MUCH
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AND
CACHES
I
BOUGHT
MINE
FROM
THIRD
WAVE
FOR
WELL
UNDER
I
HAVE
HAD
ABSOLUTELY
NO
PROBLEMS
AT
ALL
WITH
IT
IF
YOU
GET
COMPLETE
SPEEDOMETER
RUNS
FOR
A

ID
LIKE
TO

LETS
CHECK
THE
CONVENTIONAL
