hi
i
own
an
lciii
and
i
recently
heard
an
interesting
rumor
i
heard
that
the
lciii
has
a
built
in
slot
for
a
powerpc
chip
is
this
true
i
heard
that
the
slot
is
not
the
same
as
the
pds
slot
is
that
true
thanks

well
i
also
have
an
lc
iii
popping
the

revealed
one
socket
for
an
additional
vram
simm
one
socket
for
a
ram
simm
one
socket
for
a
flatpack
fpu
a
processordirect
slot
pds
identical
to
the
lclc
ii
but
with
an
additional
set
of
connetions
to
one
side
for
the
full
data
path
that
the
lclc
ii
lacked
thats
it
i
guess
a
board
with
a
powerpc
chip
could
be
made
that
would
fit
in
the
pds
but
thats
the
only
place
