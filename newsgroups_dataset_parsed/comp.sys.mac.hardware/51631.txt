need
modem
info
for
duo
hi
what
alternatives
to
the
express
modem
do
duo
owners
have
if
they
want
to
go
at
least
baud
every
place
in
town
says
they
are
back
ordered
and
part
of
the
reason
i
want
a
laptop
mac
is
so
i
can
use
it
as
a
remote
terminal
from
wherever
i
am
but
i
really
would
hate
to
have
to
wait
months
to
get
a
modem
in
or
have
to
settle
with
baud
thank
you
