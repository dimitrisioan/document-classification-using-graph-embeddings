POSITION
OF
B
ON
ERG
KEYBOARD
SO
FAR
I
HAVE
ONLY
SEEN
PICTURES
OF
THE
NEW
ERGONOMIC
KEYBOARD
BUT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
B
IS
PLACED
ON
THE
LEFT
PART
AFTER
THE
SPLIT
HOWEVER
WHEN
I
LEARNED
TYPING
IN
SCHOOL
SOME
YEARS
AGO
I
WAS
TAUGHT
TO
WRITE
B
WITH
MY
RIGHT
HAND
IS
THIS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
DANISH
AND
AMERICAN
TYPING
OR
WHAT
THANKS
A
LOT
IN
ADVANCE
