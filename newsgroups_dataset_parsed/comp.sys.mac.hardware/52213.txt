WRITES
WE
ARE
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WITH
A
QUADRA
THAT
HAS
STUMPED
A
COUPLE
OF
TECHS
SENT
TO
US
BY
THE
VENDOR
AS
WELL
AS
US
THIS
QUADRA
IS
STUFFED
WITH
RAM
VRAM
AND
SOME
LARGE
DISK
I
THINK
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
AFTER
A
CERTAIN
VARIABLE
INTERVAL
OF
TIME
THE
VIDEO
CIRCUITRY
LOSES
VERTICAL
SYNC
IT
IS
QUITE
APPARENT
THAT
THE
MAC
CPU
IS
STILL
OK
AND
THE
PROBLEM
REALLY
SEEMS
TO
LIE
WITH
THE
VIDEO
CIRCUITRY
SINCE
YOU
CAN
STILL
SAVE
YOUR
DOCUMENTS
QUIT
YOUR
APLPICATIONS
EVEN
PULL
DOWN
MENUS
ETC
ONLY
THE
DISPLAY
IS
SCROLLING
LIK
CRAZY
SO
ITS
PRETTY
HARD
TO
HIT
MENU
ITEMS
OTHER
INFO
DELETED
HAS
ANYONE
ANY
IDEAS
PLEASE
PLEASE
EMAIL
AS
WELL
AS
POSTING
CAUSE
I
SEEM
TO
BE
SPENDING
A
LOT
OF
TIME
REBOOTING
MY
MAC
LATELY
AND
HAVE
A
LOT
LESS
TIME
AVAILABLE
TO
READ
NEWS
ARE
YOU
SURE
ITS
NOT
A
PROBLEM
CAUSED
BY
SOFTWARE
IVE
SEEN
THIS
SORT
OF
EFFECT
WHEN
A
RUNAWAY
PROGRAM
WHICH
COULD
BE
CAUSED
BY
AN
INIT
CONFLICT
FOR
INSTANCE
ACCIDENTALLY
WACKS
ON
A
REGISTER
IN
THE
VIDEO
HARDWARE
HAVE
YOU
TRIED
BOOTING
WITH
NO
EXTENSIONS
AND
THEN
LETTING
THE
JUST
SIT
THERE
IN
THE
FINDER
YOU
MIGHT
ALSO
WANT
TO
TRY
CHANGING
TO
ADDRESSING
YES
I
KNOW
YOU
CANT
ACCESS
YOUR
FULL
MB
OF
RAM
ITS
JUST
AN
EXPERIMENT
AS
THE
VIDEO
HARDWARE
REGISTERS
CANT
BE
ACCESSED
THEN
ANOTHER
THING
TO
TRY
AS
A
RECOVERY
MEASURE
IS
TO
USE
SOMETHING
LIKE
QUICKKEYS
TO
CHANGE
THE
PIXEL
DEPTH
OF
THE
DISPLAY
THIS
REPROGRAMS
SOME
OF
THE
VIDEO
HARDWARE
REGISTERS
AND
MAY
ALLOW
SYNC
TO
BE
RESTORED
DALE
ADAMS
