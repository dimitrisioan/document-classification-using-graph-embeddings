memory
upgrades
excuse
me
if
this
is
a
frequent
question
i
checked
in
several
faqs
but
couldnt
really
find
anything
i
have
a
iisi
with
the
standard
meg
memory
and
i
want
need
to
add
additional
memory
but
im
on
a
budget
i
really
dont
need
more
than
meg
max
so
what
is
the
best
performance
wise
and
most
economical
way
to
do
this
someone
told
me
that
i
should
only
use
simms
of
the
same
amount
of
memory
that
is
meg
meg
etc
what
if
i
just
wanted
to
buy
just
meg
and
use
the
rest
of
what
i
already
have
the
manual
hasnt
been
very
helpful
with
this
thanks
respond
via
email
if
it
isnt
worth
the
bandwidth
common
human
laws
and
interests
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
a
and
emotions
have
no
validity
a
happy
dogma
but
it
makes
me
or
signifigance
in
the
vast
feel
better
about
not
cosmosatlarge
getting
laid
