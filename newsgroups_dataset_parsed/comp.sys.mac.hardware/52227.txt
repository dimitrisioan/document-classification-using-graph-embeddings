BTW
WHEN
ENCOURAGING
EMPLOYEES
TO
POWER
OFF
MONITORS
WHEN
LEAVING
WORK
IT
WAS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THIS
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
DONE
WITH
MONITORS
WITH
THE
POWER
SWITCH
ON
FRONT
THERE
WAS
SOME
INDICATION
THAT
MONITORS
WITH
POWER
SWITCHES
ON
THE
REAR
ARE
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
TOLERATE

POWER

THIS
MAY
ONLY
APPLY
TO
THE
MONITORS
WE
USE
BUT
MIGHT
BE
WORTH
CHECKING
IF
YOU
HAPPEN
TO
HAVE
A
MONITOR
WITH
THE
SWITCH

IM
NOT
AN

HAVING
SPENT

MUCH
OF
MY

LOOKING

OR

IT
IS
MY
FIRM
BELIEF
THAT
THE
ONLY
REASON
ANY

IN

WHERE

ARE
HARD
TO

IS
BECAUSE
THE

PUT

THIS
IS
BECAUSE
