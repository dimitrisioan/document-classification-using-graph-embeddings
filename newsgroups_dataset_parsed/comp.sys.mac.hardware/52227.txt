btw
when
encouraging
employees
to
power
off
monitors
when
leaving
work
it
was
pointed
out
that
this
should
only
be
done
with
monitors
with
the
power
switch
on
front
there
was
some
indication
that
monitors
with
power
switches
on
the
rear
are
not
designed
to
tolerate
lots
of
power
cycling
this
may
only
apply
to
the
monitors
we
use
but
might
be
worth
checking
if
you
happen
to
have
a
monitor
with
the
switch
in
back
im
not
an
expert
but
having
spent
much
too
much
of
my
life
looking
for
the
power
switch
or
the
brightness
control
or
the
degauss
etc
etc
etc
it
is
my
firm
belief
that
the
only
reason
any
controlsswitchesknobswhatever
in
places
where
they
are
hard
to
reach
is
because
the
designers
put
them
there
deliberately
the
real
question
is
weather
this
is
because
of
stupidity
or
maliciousness
