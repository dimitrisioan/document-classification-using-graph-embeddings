THE
SUBJECT
SAYS
WHAT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DO
HERE
ARE
THE
DETAILS
I
HAVE
A
WITH
THE
MACRESCUE
UPGRADE
BOARD
THAT
MAKES
IT
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
A
PLUS
SYSTEM
AND
MACENVY
BOTH
IDENTIFY
IT
AS
SUCH
THE

BOARD
CLIPS
ONTO
THE
ON
THE

IT
ALSO
HAS
A
ITSELF
PERIODICALLY
I
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
CLIP
NOT
AN
ENTIRELY
EASY
THING
TO
DO
AND
CLEAN
THE
LEGS
OF
THE
LARRY
PINAS
BOOK
ASSERTS
THAT
THIS
IS
OCCASIONALLY
A
PROBLEM
WITH
SNAP
ON

THE
LEGS
WILL
OXIDIZE
CAUSING
UNUSUAL
SYSTEM
ERRORS
WELL
THATS
ME
SO
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DO
SOMETHING
PERMANENT
AND
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
FAIRLY
EASY
TO
PUT
A
SOCKET
IN
WHERE
THE
CURRENTLY
IS
AND
MODIFY
THE
MACRESCUE
BOARD
TO
PLUG
IN
WHAT
IM
NOT
SURE
OF
IS
WHETHER
IT
WILL
WORK
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
TWO
ARENT
ACTING
INDEPENDENTLY
SO
REMOVING
ONE
SHOULDNT
HAVE
ANY
EFFECT
ON
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
MY
MAC
IM
ABOUT
SURE
WILL
