YOU
CAN
FIND
RETAIL
THAT
IS
WITHIN
THE
PRICE
OF
A
KEYBOARD
OF
EDUCATIONAL
PRICES
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
WARY
OF
RETAIL
OUTLETS
SELLING
AS
CHEAP
AS
EDUCATIONAL
PRICES
I
WENT
FOR
A
RETAILER
ACTUALLY
MAIL
ORDER
CDA
COMPUTERS
BECAUSE
ITS
PRICE
WAS
BETTER
THANT
THE
CAMPUS
COMPUTER
STORE
I
FOUND
OUT
WHY
LATER
ON
WHEN
I
TRIED
TO
GET
A
REPAIR
DONE
AT
AN
APPLE
REGISTERED
REPAIR
CENTER
THE
CPU
WAS
A
RESALE
THE
SERIAL
NUMBER
HAD
BEEN
REMOVED
AND
REPLACED
WITH
A
NONSTANDARD
NUMBER
PROBABLY
FROM
CDA
COMPUTERS
CONSEQUENTLY
THE
APPLE
REPAIR
MAN
COULD
NOT
DO
ANY
WARRENTY
REPAIRS
SO
I
ENDED
UP
WITH
JUST
A
WARRENTY
FROM
CDA
OVER
THE
APPLE
WARRENTY
BOY
WAS
I
PIED
MORAL
OF
THE
STORY
CAVEAT
EMPTOR
APPLE
DOES
NOT
AUTHORISE
SALES
THROUGH
MAIL
ORDER
AS
A
RESULT
MAIL
ORDER
COMPANIES
HAVE
TO
OBTAIN
THEIR
MACHINES
BY
THE
GREY
MARKET
THIS
MARKET
IS
SUPPLIED
WITH
MACHINES
FROM
AUTHORISED
RESELLERS
WHO
HAVE
MORE
MACHINES
THAN
THEY
CAN
SELL
THEY
COME
INTO
THIS
STATE
OF
AFFAIRS
BY
OVERORDERING
EITHER
ACCIDENTALLY
OR
DELIBERATLY
TO
GET
A
BETTER
WHOLSALE
PRICE
FROM
APPLE
IN
EITHER
CASE
THEY
OFTEN
OBSCURE
THE
SERIAL
NUNBER
TO
PROTECT
THEIR
IDENTITY
AS
A
RESULT
THE
WARRANTY
IS
VOID
YOU
MAY
SAVE
ON
SALES
TAX
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
SHIPPING
I
SHOULD
ALSO
POINT
OUT
THAT
MAIL
ORDER
COMPANIES
CANNOT
GET
LOWER
PRICES
THATN
THE
HIGH
VOLUME
AUTHORISED
DEALERS
UNLESS
THEY
BUY
BELOW
DEALER
COST
AS
A
RESULT
THE
ONLY
WAY
THEY
CAN
SELL
CHEAPER
IS
BY
CUTTING
COSTS
AND
TRIMMING
MARGINS
UNFORTUNATLY
THEY
DONT
SEEM
TO
BE
DOING
TOO
WELL
THE
LOWEST
PRICES
I
HAVE
BEEN
QUOTED
MAILORDER
DO
NOT
BEAT
THE
LOWEST
PRICES
AVAILABLE
FROM
AUTHORISED
LOCAL
DEALERS
THEY
ARE
EVEN
FURTHER
AWAY
FROM
EDUCATIONAL
PRICES
