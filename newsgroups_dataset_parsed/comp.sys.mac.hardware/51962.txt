MACS
AND
A
PC
AT
WORK
WE
HAVE
A
SMALL
APPLETALK
NETWORK
WITH
MACS
AND
COUPLE
OF
PRINTERS
WE
ALSO
HAVE
A
PC
THAT
HAS
SOME
SPECIALIZED
ACCOUNTING
SOFTWARE
THAT
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
OPERATE
FROM
ANY
OF
THE
MACS
WE
HAVE
SOFT
PC
AND
I
HAVE
FOUND
THAT
THE
SOFTWARE
WORKS
JUST
FINE
UNDER
IT
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HAVE
ALL
OF
THE
DATA
FOR
THE
PROGRAM
RESIDE
AT
ONE
PLACE
THE
PC
HARD
DISK
SO
MY
QUESTION
FOR
YOU
ISACTUALLY
QUESTIONS
IS
THERE
A
BOARD
FOR
THE
PC
THAT
WILL
ALLOW
YOU
TO
HOOK
INTO
AN
APPLETALK
NETWORK
IF
IS
POSSIBLE
IS
THERE
ANY
SOFTWAREHARDWARE
COMBINATION
THAT
WILL
ALLOW
ME
TO
MOUNT
THE
PC
HARD
DISK
AS
A
NETWORKED
DISK
ON
THE
MACS
SO
I
CAN
USE
SOFT
PC
TO
RUN
THE
APPLICATION
IF
OR
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
IS
THERE
ANY
OTHER
WAY
TO
ACCOMPLISH
WHAT
