mention
that

manufacturing
flaws

new
model
is
now
the
which
just
like
apples
new
sony
trinitrom
claims
to
be
inches
im
not
sure
of
the
details
on
the
defects
but
i
work
at
our
schools
bookstore
and
can
tell
you
that
nearly
half
of
them
were
returned
with
some
kind
of
defect
or
another
im
assuming
that
you
are
referring
to
the
correct
what
kind
of
flaws
have
been
reported
ive
been
using
mine
for
about
months
now
and
i
havent
noticed
any
problems
might
they
develop
later
or

i
get
lucky
and
snag
a
good
monitor
