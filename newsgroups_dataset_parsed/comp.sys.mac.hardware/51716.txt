WONT
TURN
ON
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
WOULD
CAUSE
MY
IICX
TO
NOT
TURN
ON
WHEN
I
HIT
THE
KEYBOARD
SWITCH
THE
ONE
IN
THE
BACK
OF
THE
MACHINE
DOESNT
WORK
EITHER
THE
ONLY
WAY
I
CAN
TURN
IT
ON
IS
TO
UNPLUG
THE
MACHINE
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
THEN
PLUG
IT
BACK
IN
AND
HIT
THE
POWER
SWITCH
IN
THE
BACK
IMMEDIATELY
SOMETIMES
THIS
DOESNT
EVEN
WORK
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
I
REMEMBER
HEARING
ABOUT
THIS
PROBLEM
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
AND
THAT
A
LOGIC
BOARD
FAILURE
WAS
MENTIONED
AS
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
PROBLEMIS
