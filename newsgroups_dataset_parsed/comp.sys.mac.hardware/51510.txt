THERES
ALWAYS
ONE

DOES
SOMEONE
HAVE
ANY
DEFINITE
INFORMATION
ON
THIS
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
IVE
HEARD
OF
IT
HOW
DOES
THE
CPU
GET
FIXED
BY
A
HARDWARE
UPGRADE
THIS
DOESNT
MAKE
MUCH
SENSE
TO
ME
LETS
SEE
NOW
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE

FIXES
A
ROUNDING
ERRORS
IN

CALCULATIONS
AT

SO
PATCH
THE

WITH
THE
LATEST
OS
VERSION
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
THIS
IS
A
PROBLEM
B
ETHERNET
PROBLEMS
WITH
MORE
THAN
BUFFERS
SO
NO
DOUBT
THE
PERSON
WAS
REFERING
TO
HARDLY
