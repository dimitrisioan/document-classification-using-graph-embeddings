theres
always
one
more
bug
does
someone
have
any
definite
information
on
this
this
is
the
first
ive
heard
of
it
how
does
the
cpu
get
fixed
by
a
hardware
upgrade
this
doesnt
make
much
sense
to
me
lets
see
now
the
differences
between
the
and
are
basically
runs
at
not
has
io
bus
not
upgraded
graphics
controller
results
in
requiring
vram
not
rom
fixes
a
rounding
errors
in
floating
point
calculations
at
digit
so
patch
the
roms
with
the
latest
os
version
i
dont
see
how
this
is
a
problem
b
ethernet
problems
with
more
than
buffers
so
no
doubt
the
person
was
refering
to
hardly
screwing
up
though
jim
jagielski
and
hes
gonna
stiff
me
so
i
say
