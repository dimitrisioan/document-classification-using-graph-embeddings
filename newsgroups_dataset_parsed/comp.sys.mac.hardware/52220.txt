ANTHONY
D
SAXTON
WRITES
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
RECENTLY
ACQUIRED
AN
GC
CARD
FOR
HIS
IISI
AND
WAS
WONDERING
WHY
IT
ALWAYS
STARTS
UP
IN
BLACK
AND
WHITE
I
KNOW
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
NUMEROUS
REPORTS
ABOUT
THE
WORTH
OF
THE
GC
BUT
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
COULD
ELABORATE
A
LITTLE
MORE
ON
THE
SUBJECT
ANY
REPLIES
ENCOURAGED
THANKS
IN
AD
VANCE
YOU
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
EMAILED
THIS
BUT
THE
IISIS
POWER
SUPPLY
IS
NOT
RATED
TO
HANDLE
THE
GC
BOARD
REMEMBER
WHEN
THE
SI
CAME
OUT
AND
EVERYONE
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
ITS
POWER
SUPPLY
THIS
IS
ONE
RESULT
OF
APPLE
PROVIDING
A
LOWCOST
COMPUTER
AND
I
THINK
THEY
GOT
A
LOT
OF
FLACK
FOR
HAVING
A
RELATIVELY
HIGH
END
COMPUTER
AT
THE
TIME
ANYWAYS
THAT
COULDNT
EVEN
SUPPORT
THEIR
OWN
VIDEO
BOARD
EVEN
IF
THIS
ISNT
WHAT
IS
CAUSING
YOUR
PROBLEMS
YOU
MIGHT
DEVELOP
ONE
LATER
