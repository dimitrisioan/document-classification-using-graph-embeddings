i
have
an
ethernet
card
that
i
took
out
off
an
old
lc
the
card
is
manufactured
by
asante
on
it
i
can
read
asante

copyright
maccon
lc
revb
the
card
has
an
fpu
socket
on
it
it
provides
thin
ethernet
connector
and
theres
another
connector
on
it
which
resembels
to
phone
connectors
my
questions
are
will
this
card
work
on
any
other
model
than
lcserie
given
that
its
a
pds
card
will
it
work
with
the
iisi
pds
slot
i
think
there
may
be
a
probleme
because
the
lc
has
bit
wide
slots
it
probably
wont
work
with
any
other
lc
the
ones
i
have
for
the
lc
ii
are
rev
d
no
it
wont
work
in
the
iisis
pds
slot
since
its
a
pds
while
the
lc
has
the
pds
the
iisi
and
share
the
same
kind
of
card
ok
i
see
does
asante
propose
any
upgrade
for
their
cards
do
they
have
an
email
adress
so
i
can
ask
them
directly
their
phone
number
will
be
ok
even
if
i
pay
the
overseas
call
im
really
willing
to
know
what
to
do
with
this
card
