many
storage
industry
experts
have
concluded
that
mac
quadras
suffer
from
timing
irregularities
deviating
from
the
standard
scsi
specification
this
results
in
silent
corruption
of
data
when
used
with
some
devices
including
ultramodern
devices
although
i
will
not
name
the
devices
since
it
is
not
their
fault
thats
fine
but
would
you
name
the
industy
experts
so
i
can
try
to
track
this
down
this
doesnt
sound
right
to
me
dont
quadras
use
the
if
so
the
mac
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
scsi
timing
thats
all
handled
by
the
chip
yup
thats
why
im
kinda
curious
most
scsi
problems
ive
encountered
are
due
to
cabling
