already
shipping
and
has
been
shipping
for
quite
awhile
now
demand
for
the
units
are
high
so
they
are
pretty
rare
hm
ive
got
my
cd
drive
since
ive
also
heard
rumors
that
they
are
bundled
with
a
couple
of
cds
but
i
cant
confirm
it
indeed
cds
are
bundled
with
it
you
usually
get
nine
cds

demos
of
applications

photos
etc
i
have
compiled
a
list
of
these
and
posted
it
to
altcdrom
