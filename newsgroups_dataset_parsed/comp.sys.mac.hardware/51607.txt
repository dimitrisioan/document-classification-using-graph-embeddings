RE
OK
TO
SET
LBS
ON
TOP
OF
CENTRIS
I
HAD
THE
SAME
QUESTION
FOR
MY
NEC
MONITOR
THE
APPLE
GUY
SAID
THAT
THEIR
MONITOR
IS
OK
TO
PUT
ONTOP
OF
THE
CENTRIS
AND
HAD
NO
COMENT
BEYOND
THAT
I
WAS
GOING
TO
JUST
PUT
THE
NEC
ON
THE
BOX
BUT
THEN
I
GOT
TO
THINKING
THE
MONITOR
HAS
A
SMALL
TILTSWIVEL
BASE
SO
MAYBE
THE
WEIGHT
WOULD
BE
MORE
CONCENTRATED
THAN
WITH
APPLES
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
AREA
OF
THE
BASE
OF
THEIR
TILTSWIVEL
ADDITIONALLY
THE
CDROM
DRIVE
IS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
SO
I
CUT
A
PIECE
OF
THICK
WOOD
TO
ABOUT
X
COVERED
IT
IN
A
CREAM
COVERED
CLOTH
AND
USED
IT
AS
A
BUFFER
LAYER
BETWEEN
THE
CENTRISS
TOP
AND
THE
MONITOR
