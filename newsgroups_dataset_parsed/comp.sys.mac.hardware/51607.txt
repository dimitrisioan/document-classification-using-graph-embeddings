re
ok
to
set
lbs
on
top
of
centris
i
had
the
same
question
for
my
nec
monitor
the
apple
guy
said
that
their
monitor
is
ok
to
put
ontop
of
the
centris
and
had
no
coment
beyond
that
i
was
going
to
just
put
the
nec
on
the
box
but
then
i
got
to
thinking
the
monitor
has
a
small
tiltswivel
base
so
maybe
the
weight
would
be
more
concentrated
than
with
apples
i
dont
know
the
area
of
the
base
of
their
tiltswivel
additionally
the
cdrom
drive
is
in
the
middle
so
i
cut
a
piece
of
thick
wood
to
about
x
covered
it
in
a
cream
covered
cloth
and
used
it
as
a
buffer
layer
between
the
centriss
top
and
the
monitor
