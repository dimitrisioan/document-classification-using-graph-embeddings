networld
we
have
a
lab
of
old
macsses
and
pluses
we
dont
have
enough
money
to
buy
all
new
machines
so
we
are
considering
buying
a
few
superdrives
for
our
old
macs
to
allow
folks
with
high
density
disks
to
use
our
equipment
i
was
wondering
what
experiences
good
or
bad
people
have
had
with
this
sort
of
upgrade
