WRITES
HI
THERE
I
HAVE
A
MAC
LC
AND
CONSIDER
BUYING
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
DOUBLE
SPEED
OF
IS
ACHIEVABLE
ONLY
ON
MACHINES
WITH
THIS
IS
COMPLETELY
FALSE
THE
DOUBLE
SPEED
IS
A
PREREQUISITE
FOR
PHOTOCD
MULTISESSION
CAPABILITY
WHICH
I
NEED
THIS
IS
ALSO
FALSE
WHAT
YOU
NEED
FOR
MULTISESSION
CAPABILITY
IS
MULTISESSION
CAPABILITY
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
THE
FIRMWARE
AND
ELECTRONICS
NOT
THE
DRIVE
SPEED
ILL
ADMIT
THOUGH
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
A
MULTISESSION
CAPABLE
DRIVE
THAT
ISNT
DOUBLE
SPEED
WHICH
MEANS
I
SEEM
TO
GAIN
NOTHING
COMPARED
WITH
SAY
THE
ABOVE
PROVES
TO
BE
FALSE
ANY
COMMENTS
THE
APPLE
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
DOUBLESPEED
MULTISESSION
PHOTOCD
CAPABLE
DRIVE
SO
ARE
DRIVES
BASED
ON
THE
SLIGHTLYFASTER
TOSHIBA
SOME
COMPANIES
SELLING
SUCH
DRIVES
ARE
SPIN
PERIPHERALS
A
BARGAIN
AT
AND
PLI
A
COMPANY
I
HATE
AND
RELAX
TECHNOLOGIES
A
COMPANY
I
KNOW
LITTLE
ABOUT
OTHER
THAN
THAT
THEY
ARE
A
LONGTIME
PLAYER
IN
MAC
MAILORDER
WHICH
IS
USUALLY
A
GOOD
SIGN
THE
NEC
IS
ALSO
A
GOOD
CHOICE
NECS
OWN
MECHANISM
I
THINK
CLUBMAC
SELLS
IT
FOR
AROUND
THANX
YOUR
WELCOME
OOH
BUT
NOW
I
SEE
YOUR
FROM
GERMANY
MOST
OF
THE
MAILORDER
INFO
DOES
YOU
LITTLE
GOOD
I
GUESS
IF
NOT
SPIN
PERIPHERALS
CLUB
MAC
RELAX
TECH
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
THE
APPLE
THOUGH
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
A
SONY
MECHANISM
AND
SPEEDIDENTICAL
TO
THE
NEC
THE
TOSHIBAS
SPEED
ADVANTAGE
IS
VERY
SLIGHT
IN
AVERAGE
ACCESS
TIME
A
MINOR
PLUS
AND
IN
DATA
TRANSFER
RATE
A
SLIGHTLY
MORE
IMPORTANT
PLUS
GOOD
LUCK
MARK
