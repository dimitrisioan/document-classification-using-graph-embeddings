vram
simm
is
this
hi
everyone
i
recently
posted
about
how
i
received
a
bad
vram
chip
for
my
new
lciii
and
someone
responded
that
it
may
not
actually
be
bad
but
it
may
be
a
lc
vram
chip
and
thus
doesnt
work
properly
with
my
computer
so
im
wondering
if
anyone
can
interpret
these
codes
for
me
so
i
can
figure
out
what
type
of
chip
macconnection
sent
me
each
chip
says
on
the
back
of
the
card
it
says
i
believe
from
the
numbers
that
means
it
is
an
chip
but
i
cant
figure
out
what
the
size
is
supposed
to
be
if
anyone
can
help
id
be
grateful
