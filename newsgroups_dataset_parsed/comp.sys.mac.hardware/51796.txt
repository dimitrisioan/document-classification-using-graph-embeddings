HI
EVERYONE
I
RECENTLY
POSTED
ABOUT
HOW
I
RECEIVED
A
BAD
VRAM
CHIP
FOR
MY
NEW
LCIII
AND
SOMEONE
RESPONDED
THAT
IT
MAY
NOT
ACTUALLY
BE
BAD
BUT
IT
MAY
BE
A
LC
VRAM
CHIP
AND
THUS
DOESNT
WORK
PROPERLY
WITH
MY
COMPUTER
SO
IM
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
CAN
INTERPRET
THESE
CODES
FOR
ME
SO
I
CAN
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
TYPE
OF
CHIP
MACCONNECTION
SENT
ME
EACH
CHIP
SAYS
ON
THE
BACK
OF
THE
CARD
IT
SAYS
I
BELIEVE
FROM
THE
NUMBERS
THAT
MEANS
IT
IS
AN
CHIP
BUT
I
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
THE
SIZE
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
IF
ANYONE
CAN
HELP
