SERIAL
LINE
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
DUO
AND
PC
I
HAVE
TRIED
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
UNDER
THE
SUN
TO
GET
A
NULL
MODEM
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
A
MAC
DUO
AND
A
PC
I
HAVE
USED
MACKERMIT
AND
VERSATERM
ON
THE
MAC
SIDE
I
HAVE
USED
PROCOMM
KERMIT
AND
SOFTERM
ON
ON
THE
PC
OR
PS
SIDE
I
HAVE
USED
NONHARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
AND
HARDWARE
AHDSHAKING
CABLES
AND
KNOW
MY
HANDS
ARE
SHAKING
FROM
THE
EFFORT
NOTHING
HAS
ALLOWED
FILE
TRANSFERS
FROM
THE
MAC
TO
THE
PS
IN
GENERAL
I
CAN
TYPE
BACK
AND
FORTH
WITH
NO
TROUBLE
BUT
ONLY
IF
BOTH
SIDES
ARE
SET
TO
SPEEDS
OVER
BAUD
I
CANNOT
SEND
FILES
FROM
THE
MAC
TO
THE
PS
AT
ALL
AND
FILE
TRANSFERS
FROM
THE
DUO
TO
THE
PS
ARE
NOT
POSSIBLE
WHEN
I
DO
A
STRAIGHT
ASCII
SEND
I
CAN
SEND
FROM
THE
PS
TO
THE
DUO
FLAWLESSLY
I
CAN
SEND
BINHEX
FILES
THIS
WAY
QUITE
FAST
AND
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
TRANSMISSION
IS
ERROR
FREE
BUT
STRAIGHT
ASCII
SENT
FROM
THE
MAC
TO
THE
PS
IS
FULL
OF
ERRORS
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
I
DO
TEXT
PACING
SO
SLOW
THAT
IT
IS
LIKE
HUMAN
TYPING
WELL
LIKE
TIMES
FASTER
THAN
HUMAN
TYPING
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
FROM
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
BEEN
ABLE
TO
TRANSFER
FILES
FROM
A
DUO
TO
A
PS
VIA
MODEM
OR
NULL
MODEM
IF
YOU
CAN
DO
IT

YOUR
EXACT
COMBINATION
OF
HARDWARE
AND
SOFTWARE
OBVIOUSLY
I
AM
TALKING
OF
A
TRUE
SERIAL
PORT
MODEM
NOT
THE
EXPRESS
MODEM
MAYBE
SOME
KIND
SOUL
WITH
ACCESS
TO
A
MODEM
AND
A
DUO
CAN
CHECK
THIS
OUT
FOR
ME
RIGHT
NOW
I
AM
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
IT
WONT
WORK
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
POWER
INTERRUPTS
ON
THE
DUO
AND
IT
WONT
WORK
AT
LOW
SPEEDS
BECAUSE
OF
SOME
CRAZY
REASON
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
COULD
I
HEAR
FROM
SOMEONE
ATTESTING
THAT
THEY
CAN
REALLY
PUMP
INFORMATION
OUT
THE
SERIAL
PORT
OF
A
DUO
FAST
LIKE
VIA
A
MODEM
OR
VIA
A
SYSEX
DUMP
COULD
ANYONE
WITH
A
DUO
HELP
ME
OUT
I
AM
GOING
ABSOLUTELY
INSANE
I
WANNA
KNOW
IF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
MY
DUO
OR
ALL
DUO
OR
ALL
DUOS
OR
JUST
ME
YES
I
HAVE
CHECKED
THE
CABLE
TIMES
AND
NOT
ONLY

I
TYPE
BACK
AND
FORTH
BUT
ZTERM
ALERTS
THE
USERS
IF
SHE
USES
HARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
AND
CTS
IS
DOWN
SO
I
KNOW
THAT
HARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
IS
WORKING
AND
ALSO
ACCORDING
TO
ZTERM
PORT
STATS
THE
BUFFER
NEVER
OVERFLOWS
PLEASE

GOING
