CHANGING
PORT
BUFFER
SIZE
IN
ZTERM
SOME
KIND
SOUL
TOLD
ME
THAT
I
COULD
CHANGE
THE
SERIAL
PORT
BUFFER
SIZE
OF
ZTERM
VIA
RESEDIT
HE
DID
NOT
TELL
ME
HOW
I
COULD
CHANGE
IT
USING
RESEDIT
AND
I
HAVE
LOST
HIS
EMAIL
ADDRESS
COULD
HE
OR
ANY
ONE
ELSE
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHAT
TO
DO
I
ASSUME
THAT
THE
RELEVANT
RESOURCE
IS
ZSET
BUT
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
AND
I
HAVE
NO
TEMPLATE
FOR
THAT
RESOURCE
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
TMPL
FOR
THE
CORRECT
RESOURCE
I
WOULD
BE
GRATEFUL
TO
RECEIVE
IT
THAT
WAY
I
COULD
PLAY
AROUND
A
BIT
AND
MAYBE
GET
MY
DUO
TO
DO
SOMETHING
USEFUL
WITH
ITS
SERIAL
PORT
OTHER
THAN
APPLETALK
BTW
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WHEN
THE
PORT
STATS
SAYS
THAT
MAXIMUM
IN
BUFFER
IS
BYTES
THAT
THAT
MEANS
INCREASING
THE
BUFFER
WILL
HELP
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
HARDWARE
HANDSHAKING
I
CAN
CRAM
TEXT
DATA
PRETTY
FAST
INTO
MY
DUO
AND
CAN
MONITOR
THAT
CTS
IS
BEING
LOWERED
BUT
THE
BUFFER
NEVER
GETS
BEYOND
OUT
OF
BYTES
MAKES
SENSE
TO
ME
