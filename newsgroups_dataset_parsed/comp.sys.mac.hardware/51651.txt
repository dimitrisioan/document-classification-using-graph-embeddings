EX
SYQUEST
IN
CENTRIS
FROM
KMOFFATTCSTPUMKCEDU
I
REMEMBER
READING
A
THREAD
A
FEW
DAYS
AGO
THAT
MENTIONED
REMOVING
AN
EXTERNAL
SYQUEST
DRIVE
FROM
ITS
CASE
AND
DROPPING
IT
IN
THE
INTERNAL
DRIVE
OF
A
CENTRIS
I
WAS
GOING
TO
DO
THAT
WITH
MY
BUT
HAD
A
COUPLE
OF
QUESTIONS
MY
PLI
SYQUEST
DRIVE
HAS
A
WIRE
FROM
THE
DRIVE
TO
AN
ID
SWITCH
ON
THE
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
CASE
WHERE
DO
I
CONNECT
THIS
SWITCH
CAN
THE
COMPUTER
JUST
TELL
WITH
INTERNAL
DRIVES
I
NOTICED
THAT
THE
DRIVE
WILL
LAY
OVER
PART
OF
THE
MOTHERBOARD
I
DIDNT
LOOK
CLOSELY
BUT
I
SEEM
TO
RECALL
IT
LAYING
OVER
THE
RAM
THATS
SOLDERED
ONTO
THE
MOTHERBOARD
WOULD
THAT
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
ONE
LAST
QUESTION
IS
THERE
ANYWHERE
TO
ORDER
A
FACEPLATE
COVER
THE
DRIVES
FRONT
PANEL
IS
SMALLER
THAN
THE
SPACE
LEFT
IN
THE
CASE
THE
DRIVES
PANEL
IS
THE
SAME
SIZE
AS
THE
SPOTSBM
CLONES
CASES
SHOULD
I
JUST
CUT
A
HOLE
IN
THE
PLASTIC
PANEL
THAT
IS
CURRENTLY
HOLDING
TMPTY
PLACE
ANS
ARE
WELCOMED
