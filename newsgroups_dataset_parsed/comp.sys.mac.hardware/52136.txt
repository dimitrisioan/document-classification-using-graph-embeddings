WELL
I
DONT
EXACLTY
KNOW
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
DONE
BUT
WHAT
I
DO
IS
KEEP
MY
CPU
ON
AND
TURN
MY
MONITOR
OFF
WHEN
NOT
IN
USE
I
DO
THIS
AS
MUCH
FOR
EASING
POWER
CONSUMPTION
AS
ANYTHING
THOUGH
TURNING
OFF
THE
MONITOR
WHEN
NOT
IN
USE
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
REQUIRING
LESS
RAM
THAN
A
SCREEN
SAVER
BUT
IT
REQUIRES
MORE
OF
MY
MEMORY
TO
REMEMBER
TO
TURN
IT
OFF
PRETTY
EASY
TO
REMEMBER
TO
TURN
IT
ON
THOUGH
