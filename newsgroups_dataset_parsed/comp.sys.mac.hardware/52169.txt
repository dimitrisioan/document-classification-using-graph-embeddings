i
have
a
and
a
generation
systems
pds
card
for
a
screen
it
worked
great
until
i
upgraded
from
to
mb
ram
now
with
and
or
it
does
not
boot
a
tech
support
person
said
the
card
does
not
support
these
fixes
i
guess
he
is
right
early
versions
of
the
rasterops
cards
did
not
either
but
they
fixed
it
and
people
with
problems
can
get
a
free
rom
upgrade
from
rasterops
but
when
pressing
the
shift
key
while
booting
when
the
ext
monitor
goes
black
after
having
been
grey
the
system
sometimes
boots
properly
and
then
works
ok
with
the
and
full
graphics
whats
happening
very
easy
if
you
boot
without
the
control
panel
then
it
will
disable
or
rather
not
reinstall
the
clean
patches
so
when
you
run
ok
you
must
be
in
adressing
mode
check
about
this
macintosh
and
see
if
you
havce
a
system
thanks
a
lot
for
any
advice
please
