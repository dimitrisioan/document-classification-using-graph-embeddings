WEEKEND
AFTER
STARTING
LIFE
AS
A
WAY
BACK
IN
SOOO
IM
IN
THE
MARKET
FOR
A
NEW
MACHINE
A
BIT
SOONER
THAN
I
INTENDED
TO
BE
IM
LOOKING
INTO
PICKING
UP
A
POWERBOOK
OR
MAYBE
AND
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
QUESTIONS
THAT
HOPEFULLY
SOMEBODY

DOES
ANYBODY

ANY
DIRT

EXPECTED
ID
HEARD
THE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
MAKE
AN
APPEARENCE
THIS
SUMMER
BUT
HAVENT
HEARD
ANYMORE
ON
IT
AND
SINCE
I
DONT
HAVE
ACCESS
TO

WAS
WONDERING

ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
HAD
MORE
INFO
HAS
ANYBODY
HEARD
RUMORS
ABOUT
PRICE
DROPS
TO
THE
POWERBOOK
LINE
LIKE
THE
ONES
THE
DUOS
JUST
WENT

RECENTLY
WHATS
THE
IMPRESSION
OF
THE
DISPLAY
ON
THE
I
COULD
PROBABLY
SWING
A
IF

GOT
THE
DISK
RATHER

I
DONT
REALLY
HAVE
A
FEEL
FOR
HOW

BETTER
THE
DISPLAY
IS
YEA

LOOKS
GREAT
IN
THE

IT
REALLY
THAT
GOOD
COULD
I
SOLICIT
SOME
OPINIONS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
USE
THE
AND
DAYTODAY
ON
IF
ITS
WORTH
TAKING
THE
DISK
SIZE
AND
MONEY
HIT
TO
GET
THE
ACTIVE
DISPLAY

REALIZE

IS
A
REAL
SUBJECTIVE
QUESTION

MACHINES
IN
A
COMPUTER
STORE
BREIFLY
AND
FIGURED
THE
OPINIONS
