questions
well
folks
my
mac
plus
finally
gave
up
the
ghost
this
weekend
after
starting
life
as
a
way
back
in
sooo
im
in
the
market
for
a
new
machine
a
bit
sooner
than
i
intended
to
be
im
looking
into
picking
up
a
powerbook
or
maybe
and
have
a
bunch
of
questions
that
hopefully
somebody
can
answer
does
anybody
know
any
dirt
on
when
the
next
round
of
powerbook
introductions
are
expected
id
heard
the
was
supposed
to
make
an
appearence
this
summer
but
havent
heard
anymore
on
it
and
since
i
dont
have
access
to
macleak
i
was
wondering
if
anybody
out
there
had
more
info
has
anybody
heard
rumors
about
price
drops
to
the
powerbook
line
like
the
ones
the
duos
just
went
through
recently
whats
the
impression
of
the
display
on
the
i
could
probably
swing
a
if
i
got
the
disk
rather
than
the
but
i
dont
really
have
a
feel
for
how
much
better
the
display
is
yea
it
looks
great
in
the
store
but
is
that
all
wow
or
is
it
really
that
good
could
i
solicit
some
opinions
of
people
who
use
the
and
daytoday
on
if
its
worth
taking
the
disk
size
and
money
hit
to
get
the
active
display
i
realize
this
is
a
real
subjective
question
but
ive
only
played
around
with
the
machines
in
a
computer
store
breifly
and
figured
the
opinions
of
somebody
who
actually
uses
the
machine
daily
might
prove
helpful
how
well
does

perform
thanks
a
bunch
in
advance
for
any
info
if
you
could
email
ill
post
a
summary
