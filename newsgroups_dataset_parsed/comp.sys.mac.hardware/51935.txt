good
display
card
for
multisync
hi
there
i
wonder
if
anyone
knows
and
can
recommend
me
a
good
nubus
display
card
for
driving
a
multisync
nec
the
nec
can
do
horizontal
refresh
from
khz
to
khz
and
vertical
from
hz
to
hz
and
can
do
max
interlaced
though
i
am
looking
for
something
more
like
or
noninterlaced
it
would
be
very
nice
to
find
a
card
which
can
be
programmed
quite
freely
within
these
limits
and
is
capable
to
display
at
least
preferably
more
is
there
anything
on
the
market
that
comes
even
close
thanks
jartsu
