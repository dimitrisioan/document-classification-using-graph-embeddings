accelerating
the
macplus
were
about
ready
to
take
a
bold
step
into
the
around
here
by
accelerating
our
rather
large
collection
of
stock
macplus
computers
yes
indeed
difficult
to
comprehend
why
anyone
would
want
to
accelerate
a
macplus
but
thats
another
story
suffuce
it
to
say
we
can
get
accelerators
easier
than
new
machines
hey
i
dont
make
the
rules
anyway
on
to
the
purpose
of
this
post
im
looking
for
info
on
macplus
acelerators
so
far
ive
found
some
lit
on
the
novy
accelerator
and
the
micrmac
multispeed
accelartor
both
look
acceptable
but
i
would
like
to
hear
from
anyone
who
has
tried
these
also
if
someone
would
recommend
another
accelerator
for
the
macplus
id
like
to
hear
about
it
thanks
for
any
time
and
effort
you
expend
on
this
