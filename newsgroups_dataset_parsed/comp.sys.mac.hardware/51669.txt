HI
I
OWN
AN
LCIII
AND
I
RECENTLY
HEARD
AN
INTERESTING
RUMOR
I
HEARD
THAT
THE
LCIII
HAS
A
BUILT
IN
SLOT
FOR
A
POWERPC
CHIP
IS
THIS
TRUE
I
HEARD
THAT
THE
SLOT
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
PDS
SLOT
IS
THAT
TRUE
THANKS
DAVID

WELL
I
ALSO
HAVE
AN
LC
III
POPPING
THE
TOP
REVEALED
ONE
SOCKET
FOR
AN
ADDITIONAL
VRAM
SIMM
ONE
SOCKET
FOR
A
RAM
SIMM
ONE
SOCKET
FOR
A
FLATPACK
FPU
A
PROCESSORDIRECT
SLOT
PDS
IDENTICAL
TO
THE
LCLC
II
BUT
WITH
AN
ADDITIONAL
SET
OF
CONNETIONS
TO
ONE
SIDE
FOR
THE
FULL
DATA
PATH
THAT
THE
LCLC
II
LACKED
THATS
IT
I
GUESS
A
BOARD
WITH
A
POWERPC
CHIP
COULD
BE
MADE
THAT
WOULD
FIT
IN
THE
PDS
BUT
THATS
THE
ONLY
PLACE
SO
WILL
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
HAVE
A
NUBUS
OR
PDS
POWERPC
UPGRADE
OR
WILL
IT
REQUIRE
A
LOGIC
BOARD
SWAP
IT
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
FOR
APPLE
TO
COME
OUT
WITH
A
NUBUS
POWERPC
THAT
ALLOWED
USE
OF
THE
CPUS
LIKE
ROCKETSHARE
BUT
I
GUESS
THATS
GETTING
A
BIT
FANTASTIC
I
WAS
WONDERING
SINCE
MACWEEK
REPORTED
THAT
DEVELOPERS
WERE
SEEDED
WITH
POWERPCS
ON
A
NUBUS
CARD
ALSO
ANY
WORD
ON
MACHINE
ARRIVALS
OR
ESTIMATED
SPEED
LAST
I
HEARD
THE
ESTIMATES
WERE
AROUND
TIMES
THE
SPEED
OF
A
QUADRA
IN
NATIVE
RISC
MODE
I
HEARD
AN
APPLE
EMPLOYEE
MUMBLE
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
POWERPC
MACHINES
AT
A
MUCH
EARLIER
DATE
THAT
BUT
I
DOUBT
ITS
TRUE
FINALLY
IS
THE
POWERPC
DEVELOPERS
CD
MINICOURSE
AVAILABLE
I
SAW
IT
ADVERTISED
IN
THE
DEVELOPERS
UNIVERSITY
CALENDAR
AND
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
ITS
AT
ALL
INTERESTING
