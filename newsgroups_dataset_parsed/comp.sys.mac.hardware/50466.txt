WOULDNT
YOU
SAY
WHO
IS
GOING
TO
THROW
ALL
THAT
TO
THE
SIDE
AND
GET
THE
MAC

FOR
NOT
QUITE
THE

TO
BE
CONSIDDERED
HERE
FACT
IFWHEN
APPLE
RELEASE
SYSTEM
OR
WHAT
EVER
IS
CURRENT
AT
THE
TIME
OF
RELEASE
THEN
YOU
WILL
SEE
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS
APPLE
NO
LONGER
PRODUCING

WITH
THEIR
TO
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHO
IS
GOING
TO
PAY
APPLES
PRICES
WHEN
THEY
CAN
GET
THE
SAME
THING
CHEAPER
ELSE
WHERE
HECK
WE
CAN
GET
A
SUN

AND
INFACT
WE
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF

ALL
COMES
DOWN
TO
IF
APPLE
RELEASED
THIS
BEFORE
WINDOWS
WAS
RELEASED
ID
BE
BEHIND
THEM
THEY
MISSED
THE

IS
APPLE
CONTINUED
DEVELOPMENT
WILL
IT
SUPPORT
THE
TO
ITS
FULLEST
CAPABILITIES
RUN
FASTER
THAN
WINDOWS
IT
MUST
DO
SOMETHING
SIGNIFICANTLY
BETTER
THAN
WINDOWS
AND
TO
WARRENT
BEING
RELEASED
NO
THE
CONTINUED
DEVELEOPMENT
IS
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
BECOMMING
LESS
AND
LESS
PROFIT
IN
HARDWARE
SO
THE
NEXT
STEP
NO
PUN
INTENDEDWELL
SORT
OF
IS
TO
MAKE
THE
MONEY
IN
SOFTWARE
LOOK
AT
MICROSOFT
IF
YOU
THINK
IT
CANT
HAPPEN
AFTER
ALL
YOU
CAN
SELL
MULTIPLE
PIECES
OF
SOFTWARE
TO
ONE
HARDWARE
PLATFORM
AS
YOU
ALSO
SAID
WINDOWS
IS
A
NIGHTMARE
FOR
PROGRAMMERS
SO
WILL
THE
TEMPTATION
TO
SELL

TO
A
COUPLE
OF

DOS
USERS
BE
TOO
MUCH
FOR
APPLE
MILLION
