could
someone
please
tell
me
what
a
laserwriter
iintx
upgrade
kit
is
its
a
small
box
which
has
a
bag
inn
it
seemingly
containing
chips
look
like
roms
and
a
iintx
manual
the
installation
instructions
are
most
informative
and
say
in
full
this
product
must
be
installed
by
an
apple
so
what
does
this
do
at
first
i
thought
it
might
be
a
nt
to
ntx
upgrade
but
i
thought
that
required
an
entirely
new
board
any
info
appreciated
doug
the
kit
is
for
an
already
existing
laserwriter
iintx
it
is
a
rom
upgrade
that
replaces
the
font
rasterizer
code
with
the
more
efficient
speedier
code
that
first
became
available
in
adobe
type
manager
that
software
came
out
after
the
original
ntxes
and
the
socalled
atm
rasterizer
is
now
standard
on
postscript
printers
