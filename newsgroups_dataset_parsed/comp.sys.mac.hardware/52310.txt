adnausium
the
answer
is
yes
at
least
for
the
configuration
you
can
get
an
adaptor
called
mac
vga
q
from
james
engineering
and
this
will
let
you
display
and
if
the
monitor
is
capable
i
think
the
requires
horizontal
sync
i
use
this
on
my
sony
gives
a
slightly
wider
screen
than
the
adaptor
i
am
using
a
nec
with
my
centris
the
cable
adapter
was
provided
by
nec

to
call

get
this
free
adapter

my
using
a
switch
box

questions

it
is

that
was
displayed
or
how

moderesolution
