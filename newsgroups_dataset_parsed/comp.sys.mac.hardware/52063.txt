my
problem
the
lc
iis
seem
to
intermittently
slow
to
a
snails
pace
this
happens
intermittently
to
macs
in
our
department
ranging
from
iisis
to
a
quadra
i
can
end
the
slowdown
immediately
by
unplugging
the
ethernet
cable
from
the
mac
it
seems
that
something
on
the
network
puts
out
these
packet
storms
every
few
days
these
storms
have
the
effect
of
making
our
macs
slow
down
to
a
crawl
