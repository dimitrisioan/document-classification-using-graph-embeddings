WHATS
THIS
MY
IIVX

ICON
I
CANT
FIND
ANY
SUCH
OPTION
ON
MY
CENTRIS
EITHER
ON
THE

I
DONT
SEE
WHY

NEED
ONE
IF

RECORDING
SOUND
WITH
THE
BUILTIN
MICROPHONE
WITH
AN
AUDIO
CD
PLAYING
IN
THE
DRIVE

THROUGH
A
DAD
CONVERSION
SORRY
ABOUT
THE
MISINFORMATION
I
MADE
A
BAD
ASSUMPTION
ABOUT
THE
NEW
MACHINES
BEHAVING
LIKE
A
QUADRA
SEE
PREVIOUS
POST
ABOUT
SAMPLING
THE
CD
AUDIO

HAVE
YOU
TRIED
IT
I
FOUND
THE
ALIASING
TO
BE
REALLY
BAD
LIKE
IT
NEEDED
A
FILTER
OR
SOMETHING
MUCH
WORSE
THAN
I
EXPECTED
I
INSTALLED
THE
IN
THE
QUADRA
MYSELF
SO
MAYBE
I
MISSED
SOMETHING
EVERYTHING
ELSE
WORKS
GREAT
THOUGH
