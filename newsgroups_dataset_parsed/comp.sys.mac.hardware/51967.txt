btw
ive
heard
that
the
system
install
cd
can
be
used
to
boot
the
mac
however
my
drive
will
not
accept
a
cd
caddy
is
the
machine
is
off
how
can
you
boot
with
it
then
the
supplemental
manual
that
comes
with
the
quadra
explains
it
i
dont
have
the
manual
in
front
of
me
but
as
i
recall
you
insert
the
cd
while
the
machine
is
running
select
restart
from
the
special
menu
and
then
hold
down
a
special
sequence
of
keys
to
force
it
to
boot
from
the
cd
instead
of
the
hard
disk
i
think
the
key
combination
is
commandoptiondelete
or
commandctrldel
