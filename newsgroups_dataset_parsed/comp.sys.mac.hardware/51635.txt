yes
you
get
internal
mixing
of
the
analog
cdaudio
outputs
with
the
mac
generated
audio
on
the
mac
motherboard
also
you
can
sample
the
cdaudio
using
the
sound
control
panel
by
clicking
on
the
options
button
next
to
the
microphone
icon
how
do
you
click
on
the
options
button
ive
never
seen
it
undimmed
the
latest
word
on
this
is
you
have
to
disconnect
the
microphone
cable
on
the
motherboard
then
the
button
is
supposed
to
undim
the
audio
will
simply
select
the
cd
audio
when
the
microphone
is
removed
i
dont
believe
the
button
undims
since
theres
nothing
to
select
i
havent
tracked
down
a
centris
to
check
this
on
though
sorry
i
assumed
that
the
the
various
new
machines
with
the
internal
cdrom
bay
worked
the
same
as
the
quadra
obviously
they
dont
yup
i
made
the
same
mistake
several
months
ago
when
this
issue
came
up
before
noah
