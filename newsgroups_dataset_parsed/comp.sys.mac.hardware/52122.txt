there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
about
educational
discounts
true
apple
has
different
dealer
price
for
educational
and
retail
vendors
but
those
price
differences
are
not
that
great
about
maybe
but
the
end
user
price
is
more
like
less
it
is
here
in
canada
anyway
for
what
its
worth
my
experience
has
been
that
the
educational
discount
which
my
so
has
taken
advantage
of
as
a
teacher
is
roughly
equivalent
to
the
corporate
discounts
that
im
able
to
get
as
an
employee
of
a
fairly
large
multistate
corporation
which
is
usually
at
least
as
good
as
what
one
can
get
at
one
of
the
discount
computer
chains
eg
compusa
for
purposes
of
budget
estimation
around
here
we
usually
just
