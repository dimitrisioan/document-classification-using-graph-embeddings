RE
DISAPPOINTED
BY
LA
CIE
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
RECONDITIONED
HARDWARE
SHOULD
BE
SOLD
AS
RECONDITIONED
AT
A
DISCOUNTED
PRICE
AND
THAT
REPLACEMENTS
FOR
NEW
HARDWARE
GONE
BAD
STILL
COVERED
UNDER
A
WARRANTY
SHOULD
BE
NEW
WELL
SOUNDS
LIKE
WE
NEED
SOME
KIND
OF
A
LEMON
LAW
ON
THE
HARDWARE
INDUSTRY
AFTER
ALL
IT
DOES
SOUND
UNFAIR
TO
ME
FOR
SOMEONE
THAT
HAS
PAID
THE
PRICE
OF
A
NEW
DRIVE
FOR
A
RECONDITIONED
ONE
WHAT
DO
YOU
GUYS
THINK
