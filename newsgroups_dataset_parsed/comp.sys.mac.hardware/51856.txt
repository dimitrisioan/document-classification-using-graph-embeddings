ROM
GOSH
I
WISH
PEOPLE
WOULD
READ
THE
POSTINGS
THAT
THEY
ARE

ANYWAY
I
WAS
HOPING
SOMEONE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT
MAC
INTERNALS
COULD
SET
ME
STRAIGHT
IS
IT
SIMPLY
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
A
MAC
SE
TO
PRINT
GRAYSCALE
OR
COULD
TO
USE
THE
GRAYSCALE
FEATURES
I
BELIEVE
YOU
NEED
A
MAC
EQUIPPED
WITH
COLOUR
QUICKDRAW
I
WAS
TOLD
THIS
SOMEWHERE
OR
OTHER
BUT
ITS
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
THE
MAC
SE
CAN
PRINT
GRAYSCALE
IMAGES
LOADED
WITH
THE
PROPER
SOFTWARE
HOWEVER
THE
MAC
SE
CANNOT
DISPLAY
GRAYSCALE
ON
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
W
G
WRIGHT
POSTED
AN
ITEM
SAYING
THAT
HE
HAD
BOUGHT
A
NEW
WIZZBANG
LASER
PRINTER
FROM
APPLE
A
SELECT
I
THINK
WHICH
CAN
PRINT
GRAYSCALE
HE
THEN
SAID
THAT
HE
CANNOT
PRINT
GRAYSCALE
FROM
HIS
SE
COMPUTER
AND
ALSO
THAT
ALL
THE
EXPERTS
HE
HAS
DEALT
WITH
AGREE
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
THIS
IS
THE
ONE
MAJOR
BUGBEAR
ABOUT
DOING
A
PARTY
SE
UPGRADE
COMPARED
TO
APPLES
SE
TO
UPGRADE
YOU
WILL
NEVER
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
COLOR
QUICKDRAW
IT
IS
COLOR
QUICKDRAW
THAT
CONTROLS
COLOR
AND
GRAYSCALE
SES
CAN
PRINT
SOME
COLOUR
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
QUICKDRAW
THE
ORIGINAL
NONCOLOUR
VERSION
HAS
THE
RIGHT
HOOKS
FOR
EIGHT
COLOURS
SOME
OF
YOU
WILL
REMEMBER
THE
SCSIGRAPH
SOLUTION
TO
GETTING
A
COLOUR
SCREEN
FOR
YOUR
SE
I
THINK
THAT
IT
GAVE
YOU
SIXTEEN
COLOURS
BY
DITHERING
OR
SOMETHING
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
THAT
APPLE
COULDNT
RELEASE
SOFTWARE
PATCHES
FOR
OLDER
COMPUTERS
THERE
ARE
LOTS
OF
MAC
PLUSES
CLASSICS
AND
SES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
UPGRADED
TO
AND
PROCESSORS
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
PERFECTLY
ABLE
TO
DEAL
WITH
COLOR
QUICKDRAW
BUT
THEY
WONT
AND
PARTIES
ARE
HAVING
A
DIFFICULT
TIME
IN
DUPLICATING
THE
MACS
ROMS
IE
NUTEK
ET
AL
JUST
ONE
CAVEAT
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
IF
YOU
WERE
PRINTING
A
POSTSCRIPT
GRAYSCALE
IMAGE
ONTO
A
POSTSCRIPT
GRAYSCALE
PRINTER
THAT
YOU
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
SO
WHATEVER
MAC
YOU
WERE
USING
AND
I
AM
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
THE
SELECT
IS
NOT
A
POSTSCRIPT
PRINTER
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
