RE
CENTRIS
FLAKY
IVE
BEEN
PLAYING
WITH
A
CENTRIS
FOR
THE
LAST
COUPLE
WEEKS
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
THAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
IS
THAT
A
COUPLE
OF
THE
APPLICATIONS
I
RUN
ARE
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
THE
PROCESSOR
CACHE
SO
I
HAVE
TO
RUN
WITH
IT
TURNED
OFF
ACTUALLY
THE
MAIN
THING
I
DONT
LIKE
IT
IS
THAT
IT
DOESNT
HAVE
A
SOFTWARE
POWERUPPOWERDOWN
AND
THE
POWER
SWITCH
IS
DIRECTLY
UNDER
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
I
HAVENT
HIT
IT
THINKING
IT
WOULD
EJECT
THE
DISK
BUT
SOME
TIRED
NIGHT
IM
GOING
TO
BE
REALLY
UPSET
WITH
THAT
DESIGN
DECISION
IN
ALL
NO
PROBLEMS
WITH
IT
FLOPPY
AND
PRINTING
HAVE
BEEN
JUST
FINE
PRINTING
IS
DONE
ACROSS
A
LOCALTALK
NET
NOT
A
DIRECTLY
CONNECTED
PRINTER
BILL
