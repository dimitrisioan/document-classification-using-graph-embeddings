re
the
iisi
re
methods
for
attaching
heat
sink
to
processor
go
to
radio
shack
and
buy
a
tube
of
heat
sink
compound
it
comes
in
a
little
blue
and
white
tube
with
a
black
screw
on
cap
at
radio
shack
its
catalog
number
its
a
mix
of
silicone
and
zinc
oxide
and
conducts
heat
very
well
plus
its
tacky
usually
you
would
smear
a
bit
between
the
chip
and
the
sink
and
then
bolt
or
clamp
the
sink
down
but
if
you
dont
move
your
mac
gravity
and
the
stickiness
of
the
goo
should
be
more
than
suffcient
to
hold
things
in
place
just
make
sure
you
remember
its
in
there
in
case
you
tilt
your
mac
and
jar
it
hard
enough
to
shake
it
loose
you
wouldnt
want
a
loose
piece
of
metal
running
around
inside
your
mac
