iisi
clock
poll
results
long
this
poll
was
conducted
to
help
users
decide
whether
or
not
to
alter
their
iisi
clock
oscillator
i
have
attempted
to
gather
as
many
case
histories
as
possible
to
find
some
estimate
of
success
and
risk
the
number
of
replies
probably
shows
how
rare
this
modification
is
but
give
the
impression
that
success
rates
may
be
higher
than
the
previous
estimate
of
machines
were
able
to
run
at
mhz
when
no
add
on
boards
were
present
this
is
not
a
scientific
survey
but
it
is
the
best
we
have
to
work
with
thanks
to
all
who
contributed
to
this
poll
issues
speed
mhz
to
mhz
appears
to
be
the
norm
for
machines
without
add
on
cards
all
reported
machines
were
able
to
use
mhz
as
long
as
no
add
on
cards
were
present
several
apple
nubus
cards
were
in
use
no
machine
with
the
nubus
adapter
was
able
to
go
faster
than
mhz
one
wasnt
even
able
to
achieve
mhz
with
the
nubus
adapter
in
place
at
speeds
of

the
startup
sound
is

disk
problems
have
been
reported
note
unless
specifically
listed
below
machines
were
not
tested
with
a
higher
speed
clock
to
failure
hence
the
mhz
operational
machines
may
well
work
at
higher
speeds
damage
one
user
reported
pulling
out
the
plating
of
one
pad
this
was
repaired
and
the
machine
is
operational
one
other
reported
pulling
the
pin
out
of
the
original
clock
oscillator
during
desoldering
there
is
one
second
hand
report
of
a
user
putting
a
gash
in
the
motherboard
with
a
slipped

iron
no
reports
of
static

damage
no
reports
of
high

operation
causing

then
again
i
also
dont
have
any

from
users
of
defective

compatibility
appears
to
be

virtually
all

installed
these

some

some
