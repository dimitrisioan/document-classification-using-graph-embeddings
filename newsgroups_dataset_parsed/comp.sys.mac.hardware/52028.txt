enter
game
developers
the
sound
driver
and
current
sound
manager
are
inconveniently
lame
for
making
games
the
sound
driver
is
pretty
ok
since
its
fast
sound
manager
used
by
the
book
is
useless
disposing
of
sound
channels
as
soon
as
sound
has
completed
is
out
of
the
question
for
games
with
smooth
animation
its
too
slow
why
would
you
dispose
a
channel
if
you
are
going
to
play
more
sounds
soon
if
you
are
trying
to
write
a
game
you
shouldnt
be
using
sndplay
instead
make
a
channel
and
use
buffercmds
to
play
sounds
on
it
it
works
great
you
can
add
callbacks
to
the
channel
also
to
let
you
know
when
the
channel
is
getting
empty
before
it
gets
empty
the
sound
driver
is
so
much
snappier
than
sound
manager
unfortunately
system
supports
it
poorly
making
programs
crash
occasionally
the
moral
of
the
story
is
to
developers
dont
cheat
well
i
want
my
code
to
work
on
old
systems
too
i
dont
know
about
sys
but
at
least
on
there
are
bugs
in
the
sound
manager
that
causes
channels
to
hang
with
no
error
message
this
happends
when
i
keep
a
channel
open
for
long
periods
necessary
for
performance
and
play
many
sounds
stopping
sounds
halfway
callbacks
seems
not
to
be
reliable
then
only
way
i
can
safely
tell
if
a
sound
has
stopped
playing
is
to
inspect
private
variables
in
the
channel
qhead
i
think
it
was
and
the
only
way
i
have
found
to
tell
if
a
channel
is
hung
is
to
inspect
an
undocumented
flag
and
modify
it
callbacks
are
very
reliable
i
found
them
reliable
even
under
system
i
was
doing
continuous
background
sound
with
interrupting
sound
effects
on
system
with
the
imv
documentation
you
probably
were
cancelling
your
callback
commands
out
of
your
channels
of
course
you
didnt
get
called
in
general
if
you
have
problems
with
sounds
working
when
you
play
one
per
channel
and
then
close
the
channel
with
the
related
slowdown
but
then
when
you
play
more
than
one
you
dont
work
then
you
are
adding
more
than
one
synthesizer
to
a
channel
possibly
the
same
one
multiple
times
this
might
be
because
you
are
calling
sndplay
on
a
preexisting
channel
with
a
sound
resource
which
adds
the
sampled
sound
synthesizer
to
the
channel
first
thing
before
it
plays
most
sampled
sounds
have
this
command
at
the
start
of
them
you
need
to
resedit
the
sound
and
remove
that
command
then
when
you
create
your
channel
specify
the
sampled
sound
synthesizer
to
be
the
channels
synth
then
you
can
use
asynch
sndplays
all
you
want
youll
probably
want
to
switch
to
buffercmds
since
you
are
going
to
have
to
use
snddocommand
anyway
to
add
callbacks
now
before
you
go
ahead
and
tell
me
i
am
full
of
it
and
the
sound
manager
doesnt
work
for
games
remember
spectre
uses
it
and
it
works
great
if
spectre
can
spare
the
cpu
time
you
can
too
one
little
disclaimer
there
are
some
out
there
who
say
the
sound
manager
in
the
iisi
cant
be
made
to
work
right
im
not
sure
either
way
but
i
know
for
sure
that
you
can
make
your
sounds
work
correctly
on
every
other
machine
using
the
sound
manager
