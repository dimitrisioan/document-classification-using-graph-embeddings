HELP
MY
MACINTOSH
LUGGABLE
HAS
LINES
ON
ITS
SCREEN
OKAY
I
DONT
USE
IT
VERY
MUCH
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
FOR
IT
TO
KEEP
WORKING
CORRECTLY
AT
LEAST
AS
LONG
AS
APPLE
CONTINUES
TO
MAKE
SYSTEM
SOFTWARE
THAT
WILL
RUN
ON
IT
IF
SLOWLY
HERE
IS
THE
PROBLEM
WHEN
THE
SCREEN
IS
TILTED
TOO
FAR
BACK
VERTICAL
LINES
APPEAR
ON
THE
SCREEN
THEY
ARE
EVERY
PIXELS
OR
SO
AND
SEEM
TO
BE
AFFECTED
SOMEWHAT
BY
OPENING
WINDOWS
AND
PULLING
DOWN
MENUS
IT
LOOKS
TO
A
SEMITECHNICAL
PERSON
LIKE
THERE
IS
A
LOOSE
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
THE
SCREEN
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
COMPUTER
I
AM
OPEN
TO
SUGGESTIONS
THAT
DO
NOT
INVOLVE
BUYING
A
NEW
COMPUTER
OR
TAKING
THIS
ONE
TO
THE
SHOP
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
NOT
HAVE
TO
BUY
ONE
OF
LARRY
PINAS
BOOKS
I
LIKE
LARRY
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
I
FEEL
STRONGLY
ENOUGH
ABOUT
THE
COMPUTER
TO
BUY
A
SERVICE
MANUAL
FOR
IT
ON
A
RELATED
NOTE
WHAT
DOES
THE
MONITOR
CONNECTOR
CONNECT
TO
ERIK
