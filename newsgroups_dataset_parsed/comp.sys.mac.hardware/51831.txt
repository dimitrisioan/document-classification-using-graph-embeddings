however
when
i
learned
typing
in
school
some
years
ago
i
was
taught
to
write
b
with
my
right
hand
is
this
a
difference
between
danish
and
american
typing
or
what
in
germany
you
usually
use
the
left
hand
for
the
b
same
in
sweden
the
ergonomic
keyboard
is
great
but
the
palm
rests
do
not
fix
to
the
keyboard
they
just
sort
of
rests
against
the
table
too
bad
when
you
have
the
keyboard
in
your
knee
