RE
CAPS
LOCK
VS
CONTROL
WASRE
APPLE
KEYBOARD
PLEASE
EXCUSE
AND
REDIRECT
ME
IF
THIS
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
ANSWERED
BUT
IS
THERE
A
SMALL
UTILITY
THAT
SWITCHES
THE
FUNCTIONALITY
OF
THE
CAPSLOCK
KEY
AND
THE
CTRL
KEY
ON
THE
POWERBOOK
KEYBOARD
I
USE
THE
CTRL
KEY
FAR
MORE
THAN
CAPSLOCK
SO
IT
WOULD
BE
MORE
CONVENIENT
AND
COMFORTABLE
THANK
YOU
FOR
ANY
HELP
