indicated
that
david
ramseys
mac
iix
has
been
running
nicely
with
a
mac
iici
rom
in
it
offering
clean
rom
code
liberating
his
iix
from
the
virtual
memory
nightmare
caused
by
apples
system
enabler
does
anyone
know
of
a
source
for
these
roms
is
it
okay
for
a
remanufacturer
to
resell
only
rom
chips
from
used
machines
i
know
that
copies
cannot
be
made
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
okay
to
resell
the
original
used
rom
after
all
reselling
a
used
computer
involves
the
sale
of
the
rom
anyway
so
whats
the
difference
needless
to
say
im
interested
in
purchasing
such
a
rom
what
would
be
a
reasonably
price
to
offer
