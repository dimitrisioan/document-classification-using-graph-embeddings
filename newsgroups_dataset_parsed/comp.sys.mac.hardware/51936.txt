COMPAT
HI
THERE
WHAT
IS
YOUR
RECOMMENDATION
FOR
A
GOOD
HARDDISK
DRIVER
SOFTWARE
FOR
NONAPPLE
DRIVES
I
WOULD
MAINLY
NEED
IT
FOR
A
SYQUEST
REMOVABLE
MEDIA
DRIVE
BUT
MAYBE
FOR
SOME
NORMAL
DRIVES
TOO
I
HAVE
HEARD
AND
SEEN
GOOD
THINGS
ABOUT
SILVERLINING
BUT
DONT
KNOW
ANY
COMPETITORS
IT
DOES
NOT
NEED
TO
BE
FANCY
FILLED
WITH
FEATURES
I
MORE
LIKE
IT
AFFORDABLE
THANKS
