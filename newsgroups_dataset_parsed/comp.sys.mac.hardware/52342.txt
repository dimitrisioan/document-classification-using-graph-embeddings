a
professor
of
mine
once
said
the
difference
between
a
computer
engineer
and
a
computer
scientist
is
about
meaning
the
engineer
makes
more
than
ps
the
is
not
just
a
joke
scott
for
the
most
part
this
is
a
bunch
of
bunk
ive
got
a
computer
engineering
degree
yet
ive
spent
the
last
years
writing
software
that
people
actually
use
moreover
the
salary
distinctions
are
incorrect
i
received
job
offers
upon
graduation
the
two
jobs
that
actually
used
my
hardware
experience
were
lower
my
advice
is
to
decide
which
classes
and
projects
most
interest
you
and
pick
the
major
that
allows
you
to
take
them
emt
well
here
is
my
worth
advice
from
a
grad
student
i
agree
with
the
gentlemen
who
wrote
the
comment
before
me
the
important
thing
is
pick
what
ever
interest
you
the
most
and
learn
as
much
as
possible
about
it
in
my
five
years
of
education
in
this
field
though
brief
compare
to
alot
of
people
i
had
to
think
about
this
kind
of
question
a
lot
did
i
make
the
right
decision
in
going
into
electrical
engineering
as
opposed
to
computer
engineering
or
cs
the
more
i
go
thru
school
the
more
i
believe
that
this
kind
of
question
is
irrelevant
interesting
as
i
think
computer
technology
is
now
becomming
widespread
enough
now
that
it
is
no
longer
a
position
which
must
require
a
degree
i
know
of
several
people
i
work
with
that
make
just
as
much
as
i
do
and
they
dont
even
have
a
bs
degree
in
comp
sci
yet
they
make
a
year
they
also
didnt
have
to
pay
grand
to
thier
local
university
either
i
think
computer
programming
is
being
reduced
to
a
trade
practice
than
a
truly
specialty
field
it
will
be
even
more
so
in
the
future
if
your
interested
in
cutting
edge
type
of
stuff
and
you
choose
cs
as
i
did
i
suggest
checking
out
the
emerging
field
of
software
engineering
the
difficulties
for
example
of
designing
scaleable
design
environments
for
individuals
so
that
a
single
person
can
handle
to
million
lines
of
code
all
by
himself
in
a
reasonable
manner
and
then
incorporate
that
into
a
teamwork
enviroment
is
truly
a
gigantic
problemnot
going
to
be
solved
any
time
soon
unfortunatelybut
hey
you
could
be
the
person
that
provides
the
missing
key
for
some
good
groundwork
i
have
come
to
believe
that
choosing
cs
because
one
does
not
like
hardware
or
choosing
hardware
because
one
does
not
like
to
program
is
really
doing
an
injustice
of
building
and
computer
and
making
it
useful
for
something
everything
is
interwoven
and
inseparable
cs
ce
and
ee
are
all
a
part
of
a
really
great
discipline
and
do
depend
on
each
other
my
advice
is
dont
limit
yourself
but
make
a
decision
based
on
which
major
will
give
you
the
best
opportunities
to
learn
that
of
course
depends
on
the
curriculum
at
your
persective
school
i
would
choose
a
major
that
allows
me
to
explore
as
much
as
possible
beside
i
dont
know
why
the
school
would
make
a
student
choose
a
major
before
herhis
sophamore
year
hey
you
may
be
so
interested
in
this
field
that
you
decided
to
learn
all
about
the
making
of
computers
in
which
case
you
suffer
a
little
more
and
go
to
grad
school
about
the
money
dont
look
at
the
averages
if
you
are
good
you
are
going
to
earn
more
money
than
anyone
else
if
you
are
a
superstar
programmer
you
will
earn
millions
like
wise
if
you
are
a
hotshot
computer
designers
well
if
your
like
the
poor
slobs
in
the
worldlike
me
you
are
in
no
financial
position
to
continue
graduate
work
right
out
of
a
top
comp
sci
school
the
trick
is
to
find
some
generous
inc
you
work
for
to
pay
for
the
rest
of
your
educationtrust
me
its
the
best
way
to
goeven
if
you
dont
get
a
top
salary
which
i
have
always
been
a
poor
slob
throughout
school
but
if
you
follow
this
rule
booksalaryfoodshelter
you
should
always
have
a
computer
and
you
wont
go
hungry
what
else
could
a
man
want
