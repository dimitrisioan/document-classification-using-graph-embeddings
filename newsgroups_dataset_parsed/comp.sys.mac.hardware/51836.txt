for
my
but
my
local
apple
doesnt
know
when
they
will
be
available
he
doesnt
even
have
a
part
number
yet
does
anyone
know
what
the
part
number
for
this
drive
is
and
when
it
will
be
available
my
apple
dealer
suggested
i
buy
one
of
the
external
drives
but
i
dont
want
to
pay
extra
for
a
casepower
supply
im
not
going
to
use
rodney
jacks
rjacksaustlcmspsmotcom
the
external
is
already
shipping
and
has
been
shipping
for
quite
awhile
now
demand
for
the
units
are
high
so
they
are
pretty
rare
ive
seen
them
listed
for
around
at
local
computer
stores
and
the
campus
mac
reseller
ive
also
heard
rumors
that
they
are
bundled
with
a
couple
of
cds
but
i
cant
confirm
it
