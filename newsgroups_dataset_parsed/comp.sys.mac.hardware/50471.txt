adapter
cable
for
vga
monitors
does
anyone
know
who
makes
a
cable
or
adapter
that
is
wired
according
to
apples
specs
that
forces
the
external
output
on
lcs
and
the
powerbooks
and
duo
into
a
true
vga
style
output
signal
the
nec
adapter
does
not
do
this
since
their
monitors
are
multisync
they
just
route
the
signal
into
the
correct
pinout
but
do
not
switch
the
macs
output
into
vga
mode
do
i
have
to
make
one
of
these
or
does
someone
already
have
one
madeup
the
following
is
the
apple
spec
for
the
lc
cpu
vga
cable
adapter
im
assuming
that
the
powerbooksduos
will
work
with
the
same
adapter
macintosh
lc
to
vga
the
macintosh
lc
can
supply
a
x
vga
timed
signal
for
use
with
vga
monitors
by
using
an
adapter
cable
the
standard
macintosh
lc
supports
vga
to
colors
and
with
the
optional
vram
simm
the
vga
monitor
is
supported
to
colors
note
the
macintosh
lc
supplies
signals
capable
of
driving
ttl
level
inputs
however
some
low
impedance
input
vga
monitors
do
not
work
with
the
macintosh
lc
to
connect
a
macintosh
lc
to
a
vga
monitor
you
need
to
make
an
adapter
cable
from
the
macintosh
lc
video
connector
to
the
vga
monitor
following

vga

are
identified
by
shorting
pin

pin
on
the
macintosh
lc
video

the
macintosh
lc
grounds
pin

its

which
results
in
pulling
down

and
gives
the
