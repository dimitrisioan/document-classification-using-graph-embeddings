my
boss
is
considering
the
purchase
of
a
powerbook
or
duo
he
is
leaning
towards
a
because
of
the
math
coprocessor
for
mathematica
but
would
get
a
duo
if
he
could
find
a
minidock
with
a
coprocessor
have
any
thirdparties
announced
such
a
beast
i
believe
that
emachines
might
produce
something
of
this
nature
yes
emachines
makes
two
minidocksthe
powerlink
presente
and
the
powerlink
desknet
the
presenter
offers
a
variety
of
videoout
options
including
ntsc
rgb
and
svga
it
also
has
sound
out
floppy
drive
port
and
a
power
port
unfortunately
no
scsi
port
and
it
blocks
the
serial
port
the
desknet
has
the
standard
ports
plus
builtin
ethernet
alas
none
of
these
have
an
fpu
in
the
future
rasterops
is
putting
out
a
minidock
but
the
name
escapes
me
now
it
is
supposed
to
support
color
and
quadra
comparable
video
speed
no
idea
if
it
has
an
fpu
hope
this
helps
