when
apple
came
with
their
demos
to
iowa
state
i
got
a
chance
to
run
on
some
of
the
new
macs
both
machines
were
running
had
a
rgb
dont
know
what
the
caches
were
set
to
neither
machine
had
an
fpu
it
appears
that
the
is
quite
a
bit
faster
than
the

lciii
cpu
graf
disk
math
pr
rating
so
there
is
a
comparison
there
is
definitely
a
very
noticable
speed
difference
between
these
two
machines
