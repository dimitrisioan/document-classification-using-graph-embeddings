not
necessarily
a
thridparty
adapter
apple
does
manufacture
transceivers
for
thinwire
and
twisted
pair
cable
media
as
well
as
an
aui
attachment
unit
interface
transciever
they
run
at
each
if
you
use
thinwire
or
youll
probably
also
need
terminators
apples
transceivers
are
selfterminated
if
i
remember
correctly
but
i
have
no
idea
about
decs
the
thirdparty
media
adapters
are
usually
cheaper
at
least
in
toronto
than
apples
i
bought
the
adapters
from
asante
instead
of
apple

the
decstation
models
and
come
with
thinwire
only
cant
say
for
certain
about
the
models
and
so
your
best
bet
thats
not
true
only
the
decstation
comes
with
a
thinwire
bnc
coaxial
ethernet
connector
the
and
all
have
a
single
aui
ethernet
connector
only
i
distinctly
remembered
this
because
when
got
the
first
and
i
thought
all
of
them
are
going
to
be
thinwire
i
eventually
had
to
go
back
and
ordered
destas
decs
oversized
version
of
an
auitobnc
adapter
that
must
be
used
with
a
transciever
cable
for
the
rest
of
the
stations
my
advise
to
the
very
original
poster
beverly
is
if
all
you
want
is
to
create
a
lan
with
two
workstations
and
wont
add
machines
to
it
ever
go
for
thinwire
regardless
of
the
media
type
going
for
utp
unshielded
twisted
pair
wiring
requires
a
concentrator
which
means
extra
money
and
i
believe
these
units
come
with
at
least
ports
as
for
thicknet
its
a
nightmare
and
cabling
is
expensive
avoid
it
unless
you
have
no
choice
eg
the
two
machines
are
two
floors
parts
on
the
mac
side
you
will
need
one
thinwire
media
adapter
from
apple
or
thirdparty
macx
make
sure
you
get
version
wont
run
on
system
mactcp
which
comes
with
macx
if
you
get
macx
you
should
be
getting
mactcp
with
it
dont
use
earlier
versions
on
a
centris
you
may
or
may
not
need
a
terminator
depending
on
the
thinwire
media
adapter
so
just
ask
the
sales
if
the
adapter
is
selfterminated
or
not
configure
mactcp
to
use
ethernet
on
the
decstation
side
you
will
need
for
a
model
you
will
only
need
a
tconnector
for
models
you
will
need
an
auitobnc
adapter
get
one
that
can
be
plugged
in
directly
to
the
aui
port
of
the
decstation
this
way
you
save
the
cost
of
a
transciever
cable
a
aui
male
to
a
aui
female
cable
get
a
terminator
your
twomachine
network
will
look
like
this
t
decstation
centris
or
t

terminator
t
