MACS
THE

THEY
HAVE
NOT
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
ANNOUNCED
SUCH
A

FOR
THE

BUT
THEY
COULD
MAKE

TECHNOLOGICALLY
THE

SIMPLY
NEEDS

BETTER
THAN
NUBUS
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
IN

GRANTED
THERE
ARE
MORE
NUBUS

BUT
MOST
APPLICATIONS
THAT
REQUIRE
A
NUBUS
CARD
LIKE

CAPTURE
SHOULDNT
BE
DONE

ANYWAY

NUBUS
IS
A
MUCH
MORE
ROBUST
SYSTEM
