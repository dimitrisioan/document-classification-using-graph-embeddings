of
at

the

centris
they
have
not
to
my
knowledge
announced
such
a
device
for
the
lcii
but
they
could
make
one
technologically
the
pds
card
that
goes
to
the
cage
simply
needs
the
nubus

circuitry
present
on
nubus

for

they
will

have
one
for
the
lciii
pds
is
better
than
nubus
for
most
people
in
most
applications
granted
there
are
more
nubus
cards
but
most
applications
that
require
a
nubus
card
like
fullmotion
video
capture
shouldnt
be
done
on
an

anyway

nubus
is
a
much
more
robust
system

for
installing

without

i
know
that
when
i
was
checking
into

for
an

there
were
a
number
of
