HI
THERE
WHAT
IS
YOUR
RECOMMENDATION
FOR
A
GOOD
HARDDISK
DRIVER
SOFTWARE
FOR
NONAPPLE
DRIVES
I
WOULD
MAINLY
NEED
IT
FOR
A
SYQUEST
REMOVABLE
MEDIA
DRIVE
BUT
MAYBE
FOR
SOME
NORMAL
DRIVES
TOO
FWB
DISTRIBUTES
HDT
PERSONAL
EDITION
HDT
HARD
DRIVE
TOOLKIT
WHICH
IS
WHAT
I
OWN
THIS
IS
LESS
FANCY
THAN
THE
FULL
VERSION
BUT
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
WHAT
YOU
AND
I
WANT
TO
DO
CASA
BLANCA
OFFERS
BUT
IM
NOT
THAT
FAMILIAR
WITH
IT
I
THINK
THAT
BOTH
AND
HDT
PE
CAN
BE
HAD
FOR
AROUND
IVE
USED
SILVERLINGING
AT
WORK
V
AND
I
LIKE
HDT
PE
MUCH
BETTER
IMHO
IT
HAS
A
BETTER
INTERFACE
AND
EASIER
TO
UNDERSTAND
ANY
USERS
