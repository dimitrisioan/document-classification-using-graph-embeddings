problems
with
a
bunch
of

one
of
our
labs
the
fault
is
that
the
machines
either
bomb
or
freeze
when
attempting
to
write
to
their
internal
floppies
the
internal
floppies
have
been
tested
on
their
own
and
are
fine
which
means
that
it
is
a
main
board
fault
the
machines
all
come
from
the
same
batch
the
date
code
on
the
back
of
the
machines

this
batch
