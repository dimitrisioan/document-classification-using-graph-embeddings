HELLO
NETPEOPLE
WE
HAVE
A
LASERWRITER
SELECT
STANDARD

CONNECTED
TO
AN
LC
III
THE
PRINT
DRIVER
CANNOT
FIND
ANY
ADOBE
TYPE
FONTS
OR
ANY
TRUETYPE
FONTS
IN
THE
SYSTEM
THE
CONNECTIONS
TO
THE
PRINTER

THE
DRIVER
INSTALLATION
ARE
CORRECT
BUT
THIS
PRINTER
STILL
REFUSES
TO
FIND
FONTS
AND
WORK
CORRECTLY
OUT
OF
THE

IMHO
AN
APPLE

NOT
WORKING
OUT
OF
THE
BOX
IS
A
SHAMEFUL
EVENT
THE
