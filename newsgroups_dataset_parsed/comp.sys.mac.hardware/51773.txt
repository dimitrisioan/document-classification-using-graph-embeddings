stereo
sound
problem
on
mac
games
hi
i
think
i
have
a
problem
with
the
stereo
sound
output
on
my
quadra
but
i
am
not
totally
sure
because
my
roomate
has
the
same
problem
on
his
powerbook
any
info
or
experience
anyopne
has
would
be
greatly
appreciated
when
i
hook
my
quadra
up
to
my
home
stereo
system
the
following
types
of
sounds
mono
as
far
as
i
can
tell
all
play
fine
through
both
speakers
system
beeps
already
provided
ones
such
as
indigo
and
ones
i
record
armor
alley
spectre
spaceward
ho
but
the
following
games
only
play
out
of
the
left
channel
lemmings
out
of
this
world
awesome
game
btw
glider
oids
but
still
stereo
system
beeps
do
play
in
stereo
through
both
speakers
the
one
im
specifically
referrring
to
is
apocolyptic
beginning
which
my
roommate
downloaded
from
some
ftp
site
sumex
all
of
the
symptoms
are
the
same
on
my
rommates
he
cant
run
ootw
because
he
doesnt
have
color
were
both
running
system
does
anyone
with
lemmings
or
the
other
three
games
i
mentioned
above
get
sound
out
of
both
speakers
on
a
mac
ii
class
quadra
lc
powerbook
or
greater
centris
etc
stereo
machine
i
used
to
have
a
mac
ii
and
i
sort
of
rememeber
lemmings
playing
in
stereo
on
that
machine
not
just
on
the
left
channel
i
could
be
mistaken
though
if
there
were
a
problem
with
the
quad
and
pb
i
am
wondering
why
the
system
beeps
still
play
in
stereo
if
there
isnt
a
problem
with
our
machines
i
wonder
why
the
games
above
are
apparantly
written
to
support
only
one
channel
of
stereo
when
they
could
just
use
mono
sounds
so
the
mono
sound
would
at
least
come
out
of
both
speakers
like
spectre
etc
do
quadra
and
powerbook
have
the
same
roms
to
my
knowledge
so
maybe
this
is
a
rom
problem
if
so
though
why
wouldnt
system
patch
over
this
problem
thanks
for
any
help
you
can
provide
doug
book
