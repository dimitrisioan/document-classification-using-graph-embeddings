nubus
board
anyone
seen
one
hello
i
remember
running
across
an
ad
in
the
back
of
macuserworld
a
few
years
ago
for
a
nubus
board
that
had
umpteen
simm
slots
to
be
used
to
recycle
your
old
simms
when
you
upgraded
memory
i
dont
remember
who
made
this
board
and
i
havent
seen
it
advertised
in
any
of
the
latest
mac
magazines
it
mentioned
that
it
included
software
to
make
the
simms
on
the
board
act
like
a
ram
disk
as
someone
who
has
simms
he
cant
get
rid
ofuse
but
hates
the
waste
this
sounds
to
me
like
a
majorly
good
idea
does
anyone
out
there
know
what
boardcompany
im
talking
about
are
they
still
in
business
or
does
anyone
know
where
i
can
get
a
used
one
if
they
are
no
longer
made
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
please
email
me
to
save

thanks
