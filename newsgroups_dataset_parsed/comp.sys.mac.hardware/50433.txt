RE
HELP
INSTALL
RAM
ON
CENTRIS
I
HAD
ASKED
EVERYONE
ABOUT
PROBLEMS
INSTALLING
A
MEG
SIMM
AND
AN
MEG
SIMM
IN
MY
CENTRIS
BUT
THE
FOLKS
AT
THE
LOCAL
APPLE
STORE
CALLED
THE
FOLKS
IN
CUPERTINO
AND
FOUND
THAT
YOU
CANT
HAVE
SIMMS
OF
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
IN
ONE
MACHINE
EVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
BOTH
FAST
ENOUGH
IE
MY
NS
MEG
AND
MEG
SIMMS
WERE
INCOMPATIBABLE
JUST
THOUGHT
PEOPLE
MIGHT
WANT
TO
KNOW
JASON
