UPDATED
KEYBOARD
QUESTION
FOR
THE
PLUS
I
HAVE
AN
OLD
MAC
PLUS
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AGO
I
BOUGHT
A
SHINEY
NEW
LC
IT
CAME
WITH
APPLES
NEW
KEYBOARD
WITH
ABD
PORTS
I
REPLACED
IT
WITH
A
MACPROPLUS
EXTENDED
KEYBOARD
WHICH
I
THOROUGHLY
ENJOY
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
WELL
I
HAVE
THIS
EXTRA
KEYBOARD
WHICH
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
USE
ON
THE
PLUS
BUT
THERES
A
LITTLE
PROBLEM
THE
PLUS
USES
AN
JACK
FOR
KEYBOARD
INPUT
AND
THE
NEW
KEYBOARDS
DONT
I
GOT
AN
EXTRA
ADB
CABLE
FROM
MY
LOCAL
APPLE
DEALER
THEYRE
SUCH
NICE
PEOPLE
BUT
THEY
COULDNT
TELL
ME
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
WIRES
THERE
ARE
FOUR
WIRES
IN
THE
ADB
CABLES
BLACK
WHITE
RED
TAN
I
KNOW
ONES
A
GROUND
ONE
GETS
THE
SERIAL
SIGNAL
ONE
SUPPLIES
VOLTS
AND
I
FORGOT
WHAT
THE
FOURTH
ONE
DOES
ANYWAY
IF
YOU
HOOK
THEM
UP
WRONG
YOULL
FRY
A
BOARD
AND
I
REALLY
DONT
WANT
TO
DO
THAT
IF
ANY
BRAVE
SOULS
OUT
THERE
HAVE
DONE
THIS
BEFORE
PLEASE
EMAIL
YOUR
EXPERIENCE
DIRECTLY
TO
ME
I
WOULD
GREATLY
APPRECIATE
IT
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
APPLES
ORIGINAL
KEYBOARD
IS
NOT
ERGONOMICALLY
CORRECT
BTW
I
DID
TAKE
APART
MY
NEW
KEYBOARD
TO
SEE
IF
I
COULD
FIND
THE
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
THE
WIRES
FOR
THE
JACK
AND
THE
ADB
SINCE
IT
HAS
BOTH
BUT
NO
SUCH
LUCK
THE
CONNECTIONS
ARE
SOLDERED
INSIDE
OF
LITTLE
BOXES
OH
WELL
ONE
MORE
THING
IN
CASE
YOU
ARE
THINKING
THAT
THE
ABD
PORTS
ON
THE
NEWER
MODELS
ARE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
CONNECTION
USED
ON
THE
PLUS
YOURE
RIGHT
HOWEVER
YOU
CAN
USE
THE
TELEPHONE
CABLE
FROM
THE
PLUS
AND
CONNECT
THE
MACPROPLUS
KEYBOARD
VIA
ITS
OWN
JACK
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THIS
LITTLE
ENGINEERING
FEAT
I
WISH
TO
DO
IS
POSSIBLE
ITS
MERELY
A
MATTER
OF
FINDING
OUT
THE
CORRECT
ORDER
OMT
WHEN
I
GET
THIS
TO
WORK
I
DEFINITELY
WILL
POST
THE
SOLUTION
SO
OTHERS
CAN
TOO
THANX
FOR
THE
INPUT
TIS
THE
BLINK
OF
AN
EYE
TIS
THE
DRAUGHT
OF
A
BREATH
FROM
THE
BLOSSOMS
OF
HEALTH
TO
THE
PALENESS
OF
DEATH
FROM
THE
GILDED
SALOON
TO
THE
BRIAR
IN
THE
SHROUD
O
WHY
SHOULD
THE
SPIRIT
OF
MORTAL
BE
PROUD
