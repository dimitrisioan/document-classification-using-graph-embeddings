HAS
ANYONE
HAD
ANY
PROBLEMS
WITH
THEIR
DUO
DOCK
NOT
EJECTING
THE
DUO
PROPERLY
WHEN
I
FIRST
GOT
IT
THE
DUO
WOULD
COME
OUT
OF
THE
DOCK
A
COUPLE
OF
INCHES
WHEN
EJECTED
AND
I
HAD
TO
PULL
IT
THE
REST
OF
THE
WAY
NOWADAYS
AND
IVE
HAD
THE
SYSTEM
FOR
MONTHS
THE
DUO
DOESNT
COME
OUT
AT
ALL
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
MECHANISM
MAKES
ALL
THE
APPROPRIATE
NOISES
AND
I
HAVE
TO
GRAB
HOLD
OF
IT
AND
PULL
IT
OUT
MYSELF
IS
THERE
A
SIMPLE
FIX
FOR
THIS
OR
DO
I
HAVE
TO
RETURN
IT
TO
MY
APPLE
DEALER
WHERE
IT
WILL
LANGUISH
FOR
WEEKS
WHILE
I
HAVE
TO
MAKE
DO
WITH
NO
COLOUR
DISPLAY
NO
VRAM
NO
FLOPPY
OR
SCSI
ETC
BTW
ITS
NOT
THAT
THE
DUO
IS
LOCKED
INTO
THE
DOCK
IT
JUST
DOESNT
WANT
TO
SLIDE
OUT
ANY
MORE

BE
BETTER
DESIGNED
THAT
THIS
FIRST
BATCH
I

NOT
MUCH
FUN
