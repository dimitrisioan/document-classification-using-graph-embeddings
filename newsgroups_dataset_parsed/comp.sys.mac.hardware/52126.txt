they
be
kept
on
hours
a
day
from

yes
i
know
computers
and
harddisk
drives
should
be
always
on
but
what
about
monitors
they
generate
a
lots
of
heat
should
i
or
shouldnt
i
keep
them
on
hours
a
day
any
advice
thanks
take
carepaul
i
vote
for
turning
them
off
at
night
the
stress
of
offon
is
a
little
harmful
so
dont
turn
it
off
then
back
on
an
hour
later
etc
but
turning
them
off
for
hours
or
overnight
is
a
good
idea
the
electricy
consumption
will
go
down
if
you
turn
them
off
overnight
along
with
heat
we
have
a
lot
of
old
machines
in
the
basement
that
still
work
but
who
cares
they
are
off
hours
a
day
