YES
I
KNOW
COMPUTERS
AND
HARDDISK
DRIVES
SHOULD
BE
ALWAYS
ON
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
MONITORS
THEY
GENERATE
A
LOTS
OF
HEAT
SHOULD
I
OR
SHOULDNT
I
KEEP
THEM
ON
HOURS
A
DAY
ANY
ADVICE
THANKS
TAKE
CAREPAUL
I
VOTE
FOR
TURNING
THEM
OFF
AT
NIGHT
THE
STRESS
OF
OFFON
IS
A
LITTLE
HARMFUL
SO
DONT
TURN
IT
OFF
THEN
BACK
ON
AN
HOUR
LATER
ETC
BUT
TURNING
THEM
OFF
FOR
HOURS
OR
OVERNIGHT
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
THE
ELECTRICY
CONSUMPTION
WILL
GO
DOWN
IF
YOU
TURN
THEM
OFF
OVERNIGHT
ALONG
WITH
HEAT
WE
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
OLD
MACHINES
IN
THE
BASEMENT
THAT
STILL
WORK
BUT
WHO
CARES
THEY
ARE
OFF
HOURS
A
DAY
