WRITES
HI
THERE
I
HAVE
A
MAC
LC
AND
CONSIDER
BUYING
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
DOUBLE
SPEED
OF
IS
ACHIEVABLE
ONLY
ON
MACHINES
WITH
WRONG
THE
EXTERNAL
IS
JUST
A
PLAIN
OL
SCSI
DEVICE
THE
DOUBLE
SPEED
IS
A
PREREQUISITE
FOR
PHOTOCD
MULTISESSION
CAPABILITY
WHICH
I
NEED
NO
MULTISESSION
CAPABILITY
AND
DOUBLE
SPEED
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
THING
ITS
JUST
THAT
THE
NEWER
CD
ROM
DRIVES
HAVE
BOTH
CAPABILITY
MULTISESSION
MEANS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
PUT
MORE
PICTURES
ON
A
PHOTO
CD
AFTER
THE
FIRST
SESSION
THE
DRIVE
CAN
READ
AND
DISPLAY
THEM
DOUBLE
SPEEDS
JUST
TRANSFER
ANY
TYPE
OF
DATA
EXCLUDING
SOUND
AT
AROUND
DOUBLE
THE
SPEED
WHICH
MEANS
I
SEEM
TO
GAIN
NOTHING
COMPARED
WITH
SAY
IS
NOT
MULTISESSION
CAPABLE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
YOU
LOSE
THE
ABILITY
TO
ADD
ANY
MORE
PICTURES
AFTER
THE
FIRST
TIME
MUST
BUY
A
NEW
CD
FINALLY
SINCE
THE
IS
NOT
A
DOUBLE
SPEED
DRIVE
IT
WILL
REQUIRE
TWICE
AS
LONG
TO
TRANSFER
DATA
EXCLUDING
SOUND
