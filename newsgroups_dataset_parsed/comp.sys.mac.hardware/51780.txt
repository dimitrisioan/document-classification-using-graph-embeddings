se
rom
i
just
bought
a
select
and
rushed
home
to
print
some
grayscale
pictures
for
my
kids
when
i
discovered
that
grayscaleand
photograde
are
not
available
if
you
are
using
an
seeven
if
you
are
running
with
an
cpu
you
wont
see
this
in
the
printers
docs
and
the
apple
rep
didnt
mention
it
to
our
users
group
either
it
seems
that
se
roms
wont
support
those
features
okay
i
guess
i
should
have
somehow
known
that
this
was
the
case
let
the
buyer
beware
huh
apple
be
that
as
it
may
i
have
been
thinking
about
the
problem
and
im
puzzled
why
cant
a
defencieny
in
the
rom
be
made
up
for
in
software
i
write
software
for
a
living
on
unix
platforms
and
i
dont
understand
the
it
just
cant
be
done
responses
ive
gotten
from
those
i
have
asked
so
far
isnt
or
somesuch
piece
of
soft
ware
just
such
a
fix
anyway
i
was
hoping
someone
knowledgeable
about
mac
internals
could
set
me
straight
is
it
simply
impossible
for
a
mac
se
to
print
grayscale
or
could
someone
armed
with
enough
info
and
a
little
pro
gramming
experience
cook
something
up
that
would
supplement
the
roms
capabilities
also
how
does
one
know
if
ones
mac
can
support
the
grayscale
and
photograde
that
the
select
is
supposedly
capable
of
short
of
buying
the
printer
and
trying
it
out
like
i
did
thanks
for
your
help
