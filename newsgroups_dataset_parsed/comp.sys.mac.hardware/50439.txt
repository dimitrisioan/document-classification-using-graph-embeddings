MULTISESSION
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
AS
I
SAID
I
KNOW
A
MULTISESSION
CDROM
IS
NECESSARY
IF
YOU
DO
MORE
PHOTOS
BUT
WHAT
IF
IT
IS
JUST
A
WRITABLE
CDROM
DRIVE
AND
DO
A
SECOND
SESSION
DO
YOU
NEED
ONE
FOR
THAT
TOO
IF
YOU
WRITE
A
SECOND
TIME
TO
A
CD
YOU
NEED
TO
HAVE
MULTISESSION
CAPABILITY
TO
READ
THE
SECOND
SESSION
WHETHER
IT
IS
PHOTOS
OR
JUST
DATA
OR
WHATEVER
HERE
IS
A
SIMPLIFIED
WAY
OF
LOOKING
AT
IT
THE
FIRST
SESSION
HAS
THE
DIRECTORY
STRUCTURE
BURNED
AT
SOME
TRACKS
THE
SECOND
SESSION
HAS
A
NEWER
DIRECTORY
STRUCTURE
BUT
THE
FIRST
DIRECTORY
STILL
EXISTS
BECAUSE
YOU
CANNOT
CHANGE
ONLY
ADD
SO
IF
YOU
PUT
THAT
IN
A
NORMAL
DRIVE
AND
IT
WILL
ONLY
LOOK
TO
THE
FIRST
DIRECTORY
AND
THINK
IT
HAS
FOUND
ALL
DATA
MULTISESSION
KINDOF
MEANS
THAT
THE
DRIVE
WILL
LOOK
FOR
THE
LAST
DIRECTORY
WRITTEN
TO
THE
DISC
OLDER
SYSTEMS
LOOK
ONLY
FOR
THE
DIRECTORY
NOT
TAKING
MULTIPLE
DIRECTORIES
