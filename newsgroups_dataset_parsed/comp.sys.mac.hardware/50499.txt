RE
TECHWORKS
WHAT
YOU
SAY
WELL
ALTHOUGH
THIS
MAY
BE
AN
UNCOMMON
OCCURRENCE
OR
NOT
I
HAD
A
BAD
EXPERIENCE
WITH
TECHWORKS
THIS
PAST
SUMMER
I
UPGRADED
INCREASED
THE
MEMORY
IN
A
POWERBOOK
AND
A
CI
WHEN
I
CALLED
TO
PLACE
THE
ORDER
FOR
THE
PB
RAM
I
WAS
TOLD
BY
THE
SALES
PERSON
THAT
THEY
WOULD
GIVE
ME
A
REBATE
IF
I
WOULD
RETURN
THE
ORIGINAL
RAM
WHICH
WAS
ALSO
TECHWORKS
RAM
I
FOLLOWED
THE
INSTRUCTIONS
FOR
RETURNING
THE
OLD
RAM
EXPECTING
TO
SEE
A
CREDIT
ON
MY
VISA
WITHIN
A
FEW
WEEKS
WELL
MONTHS
WENT
BY
AND
NO
CREDIT
AFTER
MANY
CALLS
ALMOST
NONE
OF
WHICH
WERE
EVER
RETURNED
ARGHHH
I
FINALLY
FOUND
SOMEONE
WHO
TOLD
ME
WHY
WE
NEVER
RECEIVED
YOUR
OLD
CHIPS
I
THEN
EXPLAINED
I
THE
PROCEDURE
THAT
I
HAD
FOLLOWED
TO
RETURN
THEM
TO
WHICH
THE
PERSON
REPLIED
YOU
MEAN
YOU
SENT
THEM
US
MAIL
WHICH
I
HAD
PER
THE
ORIGINAL
SALES
PERSONS
INSTRUCTIONS
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THEY
THEIR
LOSS
OF
US
MAIL
SHIPMENTS
IS
NOT
UNCOMMON
COME
ON
AND
THAT
I
SHOULD
HAVE
SENT
THE
STUFF
VIA
FEDEX
ETC
I
REASONED
THAT
I
HAD
DONE
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
HAD
BEEN
TOLD
TO
BUT
THEY
WOULD
NOT
BUDGE
THE
PEOPLE
I
SPOKE
WITH
WERE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
HELP
I
SENT
LETTERS
COPIES
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
RECEIPTS
ATTEMPTED
TO
TRACE
THE
PACKAGE
THROUGH
THE
US
MAIL
MADE
MANY
MORE
PHONE
CALLS
TO
TECHWORKS
ALL
TO
NO
AVAIL
I
WOULDNT
GIVEUP
BECAUSE
I
WAS
SO
DISGUSTED
SALESSUPPORT
PEOPLE
SUPERVISORS
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
I
COULD
DO
TO
PURSUADE
THEM
TO
MAKE
IT
RIGHT

FINALLY
IN
TOTAL
DISGUST
WROTE
A
LETTER
TO
MY
CREDIT
CARD
COMPANY
ASKING
THEM
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
PROBLEM
THREE
WEEKS
LATER
THE
CREDIT
MIRACULOUSLY
APPEARED
ON
MY
STATEMENT
I
HAVE
NOT
IN
RECENT
MEMORY
BEEN
SO
DISGUSTED
WITH
THE
SERVICE
THAT
I
RECEIVED
FROM
A
COMPANY
IN
ALL
FAIRNESS
THEY
HAD
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
THAT
WAS
NOT
TRYING
TO
RIP
THEM
OFF
BUT
I
WENT
TO
SUCH
GREAT
LENGTHS
TO
PROVE
TO
THEM
THAT
THIS
REALLY
HAPPENED
OH
WELL
CEST
LA
VIE
I
WILL
NEVER
BUY
ANOTHER
PRODUCT
FROM
THEM
AGAIN
THERE

TO
GET
