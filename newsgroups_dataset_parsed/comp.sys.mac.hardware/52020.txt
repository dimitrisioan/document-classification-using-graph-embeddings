how
do
they
compare
also
amiga
comparisson
davidaschniderbmugorg
wrote
the
real
question
here
in
my
opinion
is
what
motorola
processors
running
sy
stem
on
a
mac
are
comparable
to
what
intel
processors
running
windows
on
a
pc
i
stuff
deleted
david
even
better
than
that
how
does
a
amiga
perform
in
daily
tasks
compared
to
my
iici
answer
except
in
a
very
few
cases
i
get
my
butt
kicked
by
the
amiga
sure
there
are
other
considerations
but
it
goes
to
show
you
how
proper
design
from
the
beginning
in
hardware
and
software
can
give
you
great
returns
as
well
as
showing
you
that
if
you
dont
have
a
marketing
department
to
speak
of
no
one
will
care
how
good
your
system
is
ive
had
the
same
experience
actually
i
love
the
mac
interface
and
any
number
of
the
features
but
am
sorely
dissapointed
with
the
speed
i
use
macs
daily
and
am
a
moc
consultant
for
osu
statistics
department
im
familiar
with
almost
every
model
out
there
and
my
experience
is
that
both
the
amiga
and
the
atari
st
simply
blow
the
mac
out
of
the
water
in
terms
of
performance
at
this
time
i
would
in
general
say
that
the
other
advantages
of
the
mac
outweigh
the
advantages
of
the
amiga
or
the
st
and
falcon
but
i
really
wish
apple
would
get
their
heads
together
on
speed
they
could
take
a
real
lesson
in
mulitasking
from
the
amiga
os
or
the
multitos
in
the
atari
falcons
too
im
still
happy
with
my
ci
but
i
dont
understand
why
the
performance
is
so
bad
comparatively
they
could
have
done
multitasking
properly
they
could
have
done
everthing
else
better
but
apple
didnt
of
course
dos
and
windows
are
nothin
to
write
home
about
either
i
just
hope
that
someone
comes
out
with
a
machine
that
does
everything
well
someday
if
i
had
my
choice
i
would
go
with
mac
in
most
aspects
but
add
the
speed
and
superior
multitasking
of
the
other
platforms
as
for
the
original
topic
trying
to
compare
just
the
chip
in
a
machine
seems
almost
worthless
a
fast
with
a
wizbang
graphics
accelerator
will
be
faster
in
productivity
for
many
applications
than
a
even
a
stock
quadra
add
a
graphics
accelerator
to
a
and
you
really
fly
of
course
add
one
the
the
quadra
and
then
youre
blowing
the
away
etc
oh
well
yall
got
worth
for
the
price
of
i
think
mine
was
only
worth

this
