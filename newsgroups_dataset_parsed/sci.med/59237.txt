DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
ANY
QUACKS
EXIST
HOW
ABOUT
QUACK
DIAGNOSES
IS
BEING
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
ENOUGH
TO
GUARANTEE
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
NOT
A
QUACK
OR
IS
IT
JUST
THAT
EVEN
IF
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
IS
A
QUACK
OTHER
PEOPLE
SHOULDNT
SAY
SO
I
WOULD
SAY
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SIGNIFICANT
NUMBERS
OF
UNSCRUPULOUS
DOCTORS
OF
THE
SQUEAKYCLEAN
TRADITIONAL
CREWCUT
TALK
TO
THE
AMA
BEFORE
STARTING
ANY
TREATMENT
KIND
UMM
WERENT
YOU
THE
ONE
OBJECTING
TO
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
BEING
CALLED
A
QUACK
OR
IS
IT
JUST
THAT
BEING
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
IS
A
GOOD
DEFENSE
AGAINST
CHARGES
OF
QUACKERY
WHEN
THE
PHYSICIAN
AGREES
WITH
YOUR
SYSTEM
OF
BELIEFS
LATELY
IVE
SEEN
THE
WORD
QUACK
BANDIED
ABOUT
RECKLESSLY
ACTUALLY
I
ALMOST
NEVER
USE
THE
TERM
QUACK
WHEN
I
DISCUSS
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
HOWEVER
I
ALWAYS
POINT
OUT
THAT
MAINSTREAM
MEDICINE
VIEWS
THIS
AS
A
QUACK
DIAGNOSIS
AND
I
AGREE
WITH
THAT
CHARACTERIZATION
LET
ME
PUT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
MAKE
MY
POINT
CLEAR
QUACK
IS
A
NEBULOUS
WORD
LACKING
IN
ANY
PRECISION
REALLY
I
BET
VIRTUALLY
EVERYONE
READING
THESE
POSTS
UNDERSTANDS
WHAT
STEVE
DYER
GORDON
BANKS
AND
I
AM
IMPLYING
WHEN
WE
HAVE
TALKED
ABOUT
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
AS
A
QUACK
DIAGNOSIS
WOULD
YOU
PREFER
THE
WORD
CHARLATAN
I
DONT
HAPPEN
TO
THINK
THAT
ALL
QUACKS
ARE
CHARLATANS
SINCE
I
SUSPECT
THAT
SOME
BELIEVE
IN
THE
DISEASES
THEY
ARE
DIAGNOSING
PS
MAY
I
SUGGEST
SERIOUSLY
THAT
IF
THE
DOCTORS
AND
WANNABEDOCTORS
ON
THE
NET
WHO
REFUSE
TO
HAVE
AN
OPEN
MIND
ON
ALTERNATIVE
TREATMENTS
AND
THEORIES
SUCH
AS
THE
YEAST
THEORY
SHOULD
CREATE
YOUR
OWN
MODERATED
GROUP
WHY
IS
THERE
SOME
REASON
WHY
YOU
FEEL
THAT
IT
SHOULDNT
BE
POINTED
OUT
IN
SCIMED
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
CONVINCING
EMPIRICAL
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
