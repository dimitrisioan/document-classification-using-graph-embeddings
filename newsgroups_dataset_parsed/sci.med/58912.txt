WRITES
SOME
RECENT
POSTINGS
REMIND
ME
THAT
I
HAD
READ
ABOUT
RISKS
ASSOCIATED

GENERATED
IS
THIS
A
VALID
CONCERN
IF
SO
IS
IT
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
SMOKE
OR
THE
ELEVATED
TEMPERATURES
IS
IT
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
COOKING
ELEMENTS
WOOD
OR
CHARCOAL

LAVA

LIQUIFIES

THE
HOT

THE
FAT

OR
MORE

WHICH
THEN
ARE
CARRIED
BACK
UP
ONTO
THE
MEAT
IN
THE
SMOKE
