a
friend
has
what
is
apparently
a
fairly
minor
case
of
crohns
disease
but
she
cant
seem
to
eat
certain
foods
such
as
fresh
vegetables
without
discomfort
and
of
course
she
wants
to
avoid
a
recurrence
her
question
is
are
there
any
nutritionists
who
specialize
in
the
problems
of
people
with
crohns
disease
i
saw
the
suggestion
of
lipoxygnase
inhibitors
like
tea
and
turmeric
thanks
in
advance

if
she
is
having
problems
with
fresh
vegetables
the
guess
is
that
there
is
some
obstruction
of
the
intestine
without
knowing
more
it
is
not
possible
to
say
whether
the
obstruction
is
permanent
due
to
scarring
or
temporary
due
to
swelling
of
inflammed
intestine
in
general
there
are
no
dietary
limitations
in
patients
with
crohns
except
as
they
relate
to
obstruction
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
foods
will
bring
on
recurrence
of
crohns
it
is
important
to
distinguish
recurrence
from
recurrent
symptoms
a
physician
would
think
of
new
inflammation
as
recurrence
while
pains
from
raw
veggies
just
imply
a
narrowing
of
the
intestine
your
friend
should
look
into
membership
in
the
crohns
and
colitis
foundation
of
america
good
luck
to
your
friend
