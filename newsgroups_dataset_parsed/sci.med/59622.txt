WANTS
TO
KNOW
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
A
SCAM
THERES
A
CHIROPRACTOR
WHO
HAS
A
STAND
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
SHOPPING
MALL
OFFERING
FREE
EXAMINATIONS
PART
OF
THE
PROCESS
INVOLVES
A
MULTIPLEJOINTED

ARM
AND
A
COMPUTER
THAT
SAYS

PLEASE
STAND
WITH
SPINE
IN
NEUTRAL
POSITION
IM
WONDERING
WHETHER
THIS
DOESNT
REALLY
MEASURE
ANYTHING
AND
THE
COMPUTER
VOICE
IS
TO
IMPRESS
THE
VICTIMS
OR
WHETHER
IT
IS
MEASURING
SOMETHING
THAT
CHIROPRACTORS
THINK
IS
USEFUL
TO
MEASURE
EARTH
TO
SCIMEDIF
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
A
DUCKAND
QUACKS
LIKE
A
DUCK
THIS
IS
A
TOTAL
SCAM
SINCE
THE
BEGINNING
OF
CHIROPRAXIS
THE
CHIROPRACTOR
HAS
TRIED
TO
SELL
THE
SUBLUXATION
AS
THE
PROBLEM
AND
THEN
SELL
THEMSELVES
AND
THEIR
ADJUSTMENTS
AS
THE
SOLUTION
THE
CHIROPRACTIC
SUBLUXATION
IS
A
DELUSIONAL
DIAGNOSIS
AND
THE
ADJUSTMENTS
OF
SUBLUXATIONS
BY
EXTENSION
CONSTITUTE
A
DELUSIONAL
MEDICINE
THE
WIDE
SPECTRUM
OF
CHIROPRACTIC
TECHNIQUES
ALL
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
METHODS
FOR
DETECTING
SPINAL
DEMONS
AND
UNIQUE
METHODOLGIES
FOR
EXCORCIZING
THEM
THE
COMPUTER
APPROACH
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
SELL
WITH
SCIENCE
BUT
THIS
DEVICE
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
HIGHTECH
SUBLUXATION
DETECTORAND
IN
THE
