my
year
son
is
so
plagued
lots
of
vaseline
up
his
nose
each
night
seems
to
keep
it
under
control
but
let
him
get
bopped
there
and
hell
recur
for
days
also
allergies
colds
dry
air
all
seem
to
contribute
but
again
the
vaseline
or
ad
ointment
or
neosporin
all
seem
to
keep
them
from
recurring
if
you
can
get
it
you
might
want
to
try
a
canadian
overthecounter
product
called
secaris
which
is
a
watersoluble
gel
compared
to
vaseline
or
other
greasy
ointments
secaris
seems
more
compatible
with
the
moisture
thats
already
there
