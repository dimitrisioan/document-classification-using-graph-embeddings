me

among
women
and
if
anyone

endometriosis
is
where
cells
that
would
normally
be
lining
the
uteris
exist
outside
the
uteris
sometimes
this
causes
problems
often
it
doesnt
there
is
generally
no
need
to
remove
pockets
of
endometriosis
unless
they
are
causing
other
problems
one
lady
i
know
had
endometriosis
in
an
ovary
this
caused
her
a
great
deal
of
pain
another
lady
i
know
has
an
endometrial
cyst
in
her
abdominal
wall
she
is
not
having
it
removed
the
american
fertility
society
has
information
on
this
and
they
probably
maintain
a
list
of
physicians
in
all
parts
of
the
continent
that
deal
with
endometriosis
you
can
reach
them
at
the
american
fertility
society
