MEDICAL
TESTS
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
CURRENT
SOURCES
FOR
LISTS
OF
ALL
THE
HOME
MEDICAL
TESTS
CURRENTLY
LEGALLY
AVAILABLE
I
BELIEVE
THIS
TREND
OF
ALLOWING
TESTS
AT
HOME
WHERE
FEASIBLE
DECREASED
MEDICAL
COSTS
BY
A
FACTOR
OF
OR
MORE
AND
ALLOWS
THE
PATIENT
SOME
TIME
AND
PRIVACY
TO
CONSIDER
THE
BEST
ACTION
FROM
THE
RESULTS
OF
SUCH
TESTS
IN
FACT
I
BELIEVE
HOME
MEDICAL
TESTS
AND
CERTAIN
BASIC
TESTS
FOR
SERIOUS
DISEASES
SUCH
AS
CANCER
HEART
DISEASE
SHOULD
BE
OFFERED
FREE
TO
THE
AMERICAN
PUBLIC
THIS
COULD
ACTUALLY
HELP
TO
REDUCE
NATIONAL
MEDICAL
COSTS
SINCE
MANY
WOULD
HAVE
AN
EARLIER
OPPORTUNITY
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
AND
WORK
TOWARD
RECUPERATION
OR
CURE

SIR
I
ADMIT
YOUR
GENRAL
RULE
THAT
EVERY
POET
IS
A
FOOL
BUT
YOU
YOURSELF
MAY
SERVE
TO
SHOW
IT
THAT
EVERY
FOOL
IS
NOT
A
POET
A
POPE
