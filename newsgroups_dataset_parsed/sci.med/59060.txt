MIND
MACHINES
I
RECENTLY
LEARNED
ABOUT
THESE
DEVICES
THAT
SUPPOSEDLY
INDUCE
SPECIFIC
BRAIN
WAVE
FREQUENCIES
IN
THEIR
USERS
SIMPLY
BY
WEARING
THEM
MIND
MACHINES
CONSIST
OF
LED
GOGLES
HEAD
PHONES
AND
A
MICROPROCESSOR
THAT
CONTROLS
THEM
THEY
STROBE
THE
CLOSED
EYE
AND
SEND
SOUND
PULSES
IN
SYNC
WITH
THE
FLASHING
LEDS
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THESE
DEVICES
ARE
EXPERIMENTAL
BUT
THEY
ARE
AVAILABLE
IVE
HEARD
CLAIMS
THAT
THEY
CAN
INDUCE
SLEEP
AND
LIGHT
TRANCE
STATES
FOR
RELAXATION
ESSENTIALLY
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
WORK
WITHOUT
AID
OF
DRUGS
ETC
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
IF
THEY
WORK
AS
REPORTED
THEY
WOULD
BE
INCREDIBLY
USEFUL
THE
FEW
SOURCES
IVE
SEEN
ARE
BIASED
THEY
ARE
SELLING
THE
THINGS
AND
A
FRIEND
WHO
HAS
TRIED
THEM
CLAIMS
THAT
EVERY
HOME
SHOULD
HAVE
ONE
SO
DO
THESE
MIND
MACHINES
AKA
LIGHT
AND
SOUND
MACHINES
WORK
CAN
THEY
INDUCE
ALPHA
THETA
ANDOR
DELTA
WAVES
IN
A
PERSON
WEARING
THEM
WHAT
RESEARCH
IF
ANY
HAS
BEEN
DONE
ON
THEM
COULD
THEY
BE
USED
IN
LIEU
OF
A
TRANQUILIZER
OR
ARE
THEY
JUST
ANOTHER
BIT
OF
QUACKERY
