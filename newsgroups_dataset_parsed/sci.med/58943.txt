PLEASE
KS
FROM
KEITHACTRIXGENNZ
KEITH
STEWART
KSMY
WIFE
HAS
BECOME
INTERESTED
THROUGH
AN
ACQUAINTANCE
IN
POSTPOLIO
SYNDROME
KSTHIS
APPARENTLY
IS
NOT
RECOGNISED
IN
NEW
ZEALAND
AND
DIFFERENT
SYMPTONS
EG
KSCHEST
COMPLAINTS
ARE
TREATED
SEPARATELY
DOES
ANONE
HAVE
ANY
INFORMATION
IM
NOT
SURE
THAT
THIS
CONDITION
IS
RECOGNISED
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
A
DISEASE
WITH
DIAGNOSTIC
CRITERIA
CLEAR
BOUNDARIES
BETWEEN
IT
AND
OTHER
DISEASES
UNIQUE
PATHOLOGIC
OR
PHYSIOLOGIC
FEATURES
ETC
BUT
HERE
GOES
WITH
WHAT
MANY
NEUROLOGISTS
AGREE
ON
POSTPOLIO
SYNDROME
PATIENTS
HAVE
EVIDENCE
OF
MOTOR
NEURON
DISEASE
BY
CLINICAL
EXAMINATION
EMG
AND
MUSCLE
BIOPSY
THE
ABNORMALITIES
ARE
MOSTLY
CHRONIC
DUE
TO
OLD
POLIO
BUT
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
OF
ONGOING
DETERIORATION
CLINICALLY
THE
PATIENTS
COMPLAIN
OF
DECLINING
STRENGTH
AND
ENDURANCE
WITH
EVERYDAY
MOTOR
TASKS
MUSCULOSKELETAL
PAIN
IS
A
NEARLY
UNIVERSAL
FEATURE
THAT
DOUBTLESS
CONTRIBUTES
TO
THE
IMPAIRED
PERFORMANCE
THE
EXAMINATION
SHOWS
MUSCLE
WEAKNESS
AND
ATROPHY
THE
EMG
SHOWS
EVIDENCE
OF
OLD
DENERVATION
WITH
REINNERVATION
GIANT
AND
LONGDURATION
MOTOR
UNIT
ACTION
POTENTIALS
AND
EVIDENCE
OF
ACTIVE
DENERVATION
FIBRILLATION
POTENTIALS
THE
BIOPSY
ALSO
SHOWS
OLD
DENERVATION
WITH
REINNERVATION
FIBERTYPE
GROUPING
AND
EVIDENCE
OF
ACTIVE
DENERVATION
SMALL
ANGULATED
FIBERS
WITH
DENSE
OXIDATIVE
ENZYME
STAINING
BUT
CURIOUSLY
LITTLE
OR
NO
GROUP
ATROPHY
POSTPOLIO
PATIENTS
DO
NOT
HAVE
ALS
IN
ALS
THERE
IS
CLINICALLY
EVIDENT
DETERIORATION
FROM
ONE
MONTH
TO
THE
NEXT
IN
POSTPOLIO
THE
PATIENTS
ARE
REMARKABLY
STABLE
IN
OBJECTIVE
FINDINGS
FROM
ONE
YEAR
TO
THE
NEXT
OF
COURSE
THERE
ARE
PATIENTS
WHO
HAD
POLIO
BEFORE
WHO
DEVELOP
GENUINE
ALS
BUT
ALS
IS
NO
MORE
COMMON
AMONG
POLIO
SURVIVORS
THAN
AMONG
PEOPLE
WHO
NEVER
HAD
POLIO
THE
CAUSE
OF
POSTPOLIO
SYNDROME
IS
UNKNOWN
THERE
IS
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
THAT
POSTPOLIO
PATIENTS
HAVE
ACTIVE
POLIO
VIRUS
OR
DESTRUCTIVE
IMMUNOLOGIC
RESPONSE
TO
VIRUS
ANTIGEN
THERE
IS
NO
SOLID
EVIDENCE
THAT
PATIENTS
WITH
POSTPOLIO
HAVE
ANYTHING
DIFFERENT
HAPPENING
TO
THE
MOTOR
UNIT
ANTERIOR
HORN
CELLS
MOTOR
AXONS
NEUROMUSCULAR
JUNCTIONS
AND
MUSCLE
FIBERS
THAN
PATIENTS
WITH
OLD
POLIO
WHO
ARE
NOT
COMPLAINING
OF
DETERIORATION
BOTH
GROUPS
CAN
HAVE
THE
SAME
EMG
AND
BIOPSY
FINDINGS
THE
REASON
FOR
THESE
ACUTE
CHANGES
IN
A
CHRONIC
DISEASE
OLD
POLIO
IS
UNKNOWN
POSSIBLY
SPINAL
MOTOR
NEURONS
THAT
HAVE
REINNERVATED
HUGE
NUMBERS
OF
MUSCLE
FIBERS
START
SHEDDING
THE
LOAD
AFTER
SEVERAL
YEARS
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
CLINICAL
FEATURES
THAT
DISTINGUISH
POSTPOLIO
SYNDROME
PATIENTS
FROM
PATIENTS
WITH
OLD
POLIO
WHO
DENY
DETERIORATION
THE
PPS
PATIENTS
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
HAD
SEVERE
POLIO
THE
PPS
PATIENTS
ARE
MUCH
MORE
LIKELY
TO
COMPLAIN
OF
PAIN
THEY
ALSO
TEND
TO
SCORE
HIGHER
ON
DEPRESSION
SCALES
OF
NEUROPSYCHOLOGIC
TESTS
MY
TAKE
ON
THIS
IM
SURE
SOME
WILL
DISAGREE
AFTER
RECOVERY
FROM
SEVERE
POLIO
THERE
CAN
BE
ABNORMAL
LOADING
ON
MUSCLES
TENDONS
LIGAMENTS
BONES
AND
JOINTS
THAT
LEADS
TO
INFLAMMATORY
ANDOR
DEGENERATIVE
CONDITIONS
AFFECTING
THESE
STRUCTURES
THE
INCREASING
PAIN
SUPERIMPOSED
ON
THE
CHRONIC
BUT
UNCHANGING
WEAKNESS
LEADS
TO
PROGRESSIVE
IMPAIRMENT
OF
MOTOR
PERFORMANCE
AND
ADL
I
AM
PERHAPS
BIASED
BY
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
OF
HAVING
NEVER
SEEN
A
PPS
PATIENT
WHO
WAS
NOT
LIMITED
IN
SOME
WAY
BY
PAIN
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
PPS
PATIENTS
HAVE
MORE
RAPID
DETERIORATION
OF
MOTOR
UNITS
THAN
NONPPS
PATIENTS
IE
THOSE
WITH
OLD
POLIO
OF
SIMILAR
SEVERITY
BUT
WITHOUT
PPS
COMPLAINTS
