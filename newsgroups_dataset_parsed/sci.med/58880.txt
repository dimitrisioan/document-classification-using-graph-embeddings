DESPERATE
WITH
SOME
VD
I
HAVE
BAD
LUCK
AND
GOT
A
VD
CALLED
GRANULOMA
INGUNALE
WHICH
INVOLVES
THE
GROWTH
OF
GRANULES
IN
THE
GROIN
I
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
IT
BY
CHECKING
MEDICINE
BOOKS
AND
I
FOUND
THE
PRESCRIPTIONS
AND
I
KNOW
I
CAN
JUST
GO
TO
A
CLINIC
TO
GET
IT
CURED
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
I
AM
SERVING
MY
DUTY
IN
THE
ARMY
RIGHT
NOW
AND
I
THINK
ITS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
PREVENT
ANYONE
FROM
KNOWING
THIS
IF
I
TAKE
LEAVES
EVERY
DAY
FOR
TWO
WEEKS
FOR
TREATMENT
THUS
I
BOUGHT
THE
PRESCRIBED
TABLETS
AT
SOME
DRUGSTORE
BUT
TO
CURE
IT
I
MUST
GET
INJECTION
OF
STREPTOMYCIN
WITH
A
DOSE
OF
EVERY
HOURS
FOR
AT
LEAST
DAYS
I
CAN
PROBABLY
BUY
THE
TOOLS
AND
THIS
SOLUTION
SOMEWHERE
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
DO
INJECTION
BY
MYSELF
CAN
ANY
KIND
PEOPLE
HERE
TELL
ME
IF
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
IT
CAN
I
DO
IT
ON
MY
ARM
OR
IT
MUST
BE
DONE
ON
THE
HIP
ONLY
ANY
INFO
IS
WELCOME
AND
PLEASE
WRITE
ME
OR
POST
YOUR
HELP
SOON
I
AM
ALREADY
TAKING
THE
TABLETS
AND
I
CANT
WAIT
PLEASE
DONT
FLAME
ME
FOR
POSTING
THIS
AND
DONT
JUDGE
ME
IVE
LEARNED
A
LESSON
AND
ALL
I
NEED
NOW
IS
REAL
MEDICAL
HELP
DESPERATE
FROM
TAIPEI
