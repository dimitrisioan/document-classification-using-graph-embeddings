re
eumemics
was
eugenics
a
person
posted
certain
stuff
to
this
newsgroup
which
were
highly
selected
quotes
stripped
of
their
context
here
is
the
complete
posting
which
was
quoted
lacking
the
context
of
other
postings
in
which
it
was
made
probably
within
years
a
new
type
of
eugenics
will
be
possible
maybe
even
sooner
we
are
now
mapping
the
human
genome
we
will
then
start
to
work
on
manipulation
of
that
genome
using
genetic
engineering
we
will
be
able
to
insert
whatever
genes
we
want
no
breeding
no
hybrids
etc
the
ethical
question
is
should
we
do
this
should
we
make
a
race
of
diseasefree
longlived
arnold
schwartzeneggermuscled
supermen
even
if
we
can
probably
within
years
it
will
be
possible
to
disassemble
and
reassemble
our
bodies
at
the
molecular
level
not
only
will
flawless
cosmetic
surgery
be
possible
but
flawless
cosmetic
psychosurgery
what
will
it
be
like
to
store
all
the
prices
of
shelfpriced
barcoded
goods
in
your
head
and
catch
all
the
errors
they
make
in
the
stores
favor
at
safeway
what
will
it
be
like
to
mentally
edit
and
spell
check
your
responses
to
the
questions
posed
by
a
phone
caller
selling
vacation
timeshare
options
indeed
we
are
today
a
nation
at
risk
the
threat
is
not
from
bad
genes
but
bad
memes
memes
are
the
basic
units
of
culture
as
opposed
to
genes
which
are
the
units
of
genetics
we
stand
on
the
brink
of
new
memeamplification
technologies
harmful
memes
which
formerly
were
restricted
in
their
destructive
power
will
run
rampant
over
the
countryside
laying
waste
to
the
real
benefits
that
future
technology
has
to
offer
for
example
jeremy
rifkin
has
been
busy
trying
to
whip
up
emotions
against
the
new
genetically
engineered
tomatoes
under
development
at
calgene
this
guy
is
inventing
harmful
memes
a
virtual
memetic
typhoid
mary
we
must
expand
the
publichealth
laws
to
include
quarantine
of
people
with
harmful
memes
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
infect
other
people
with
their
memes
against
geneticallyengineered
food
electromagnetic
fields
and
the
space
shuttle
solid
rocket
boosters
