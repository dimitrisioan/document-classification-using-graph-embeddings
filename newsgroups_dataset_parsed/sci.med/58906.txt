NUTRASWEET
IS
A
SYNTHETIC
SWEETENER
A
COUPLE
THOUSAND
TIMES
SWEETER
THAN
SUGAR
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
CHEMICALS
THAT
THE
BODY
PRODUCES
WHEN
IT
DEGRADES
NUTRASWEET
IT
IS
THOUGHT
TO
FORM
FORMALDEHYDE
AND
KNOWN
TO
FOR
METHANOL
IN
THE
DEGREDATION
PATHWAY
THAT
THE
BODY
USES
TO
ELIMINATE
SUBSTANCES
THE
REAL
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
THE
LEVELS
OF
METHANOL
AND
FORMALDEHYDE
PRODUCED
ARE
HIGH
ENOUGH
TO
CAUSE
SIGNIFICANT
DAMAGE
AS
BOTH
ARE
TOXIC
TO
LIVING
CELLS
ALL
I
CAN
SAY
IS
THAT
I
WILL
NOT
CONSUME
IT
ASPARTAME
IS
THE
METHYL
ESTER
OF
A
DIPEPTIDE
SO
A
PRODUCT
OF
ITS
HYDROLYSIS
IS
GOING
TO
BE
METHANOL
WHICH
CAN
THEN
BE
OXIDIZED
TO
FORMALDEHYDE
THE
AMOUNTS
OF
METHANOL
FORMED
FROM
THE
INGESTION
OF
ASPARTAMECONTAINING
FOODS
ARE
COMPLETELY
IN
THE
METABOLIC
NOISE
SINCE
YOURE
FORMING
EQUALLY
MINUTE
AMOUNTS
OF
METHANOL
FROM
OTHER
COMPONENTS
OF
FOOD
ALL
THE
TIME
IN
STUDIES
INVOLVING
ADMINISTRATION
OF
HIGH
DOSES
OF
THE
ADDITIVE
BLOOD
METHANOL
LEVELS
WERE
UNDETECTABLE
METHANOL
IS
A
POISON
ONLY
IN
QUANTITIES
SEEN
IN
HUMAN
POISONINGS
SAY
AND
ABOVE
THIS
IS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
ITS
OXIDATION
TO
FORMALDEHYDE
AND
FORMIC
ACID
TWO
QUITE
REACTIVE
COMPOUNDS
WHICH
AT
HIGH
ENOUGH
LEVELS
CAN
DAMAGE
TISSUES
LIKE
THE
RETINA
AND
KIDNEY
BECAUSE
AT
SUCH
HIGH
DOSES
THE
BODYS
DETOXIFICATION
SYSTEM
IS
OVERWHELMED
INTERESTINGLY
ONE
TREATMENT
FOR
EARLY
METHANOL
POISONING
IS
TO
GET
THE
PERSON
DRUNK
ON
ETHYL
ALCOHOLVODKA
OR
AN
EQUIVALENT
THATS
BECAUSE
ETHANOL
IS
METABOLIZED
PREFERENTIALLY
OVER
METHANOL
BY
THE
ENZYMES
IN
THE
LIVER
IF
THE
METHANOL
STAYS
AS
METHANOL
AND
ISNT
METABOLIZED
TO
FORMALDEHYDE
IT
IS
ACTUALLY
RELATIVELY
NONTOXIC
