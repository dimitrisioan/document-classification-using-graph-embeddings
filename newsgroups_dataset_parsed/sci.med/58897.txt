UNIQUE
TO

ITS
ELICITED
BY

AS

MANY

RESPONDED
WITH

ANECDOTAL

I
THINK
ITS
SAFE
TO
SAY
THE

IS
ALREADY
FAMILIAR
WITH
SUCH

PRESUMABLY
HE
WANTS
HARD
INFO
TO
SUBSTANTIATE

CLAIMS
ABOUT
MSG
MAKING
PEOPLE
ILL
SIMILARLY
DEBUNKING
SUCH

WITHOUT
DOING
RESEARCH
WHETHER

IS
EQUALLY
BESIDE
THE
POINT
THE

NO
DOUBT
ALREADY
KNOWS
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
THINK
CHINESE
RESTAURANT

IS
BOGUS
PLACEBOS
ARE
ALL
VERY
INTERESTING

IRRELEVANT
TO
THE

OF
WHAT

MSG
HAS
YOU
COULD

EFFECTS
PEOPLE
MAY

IN

YET

THE

HAMPERED

THEY
HAVE

KNOWLEDGE

SOMEONE
WHO
CAN
READ

AND
APPARENTLY
COME
AWAY
FROM
IT
WITH
BIZARRELY

HAVE
NOTHING
TO

THE

THIS

IN

HAVE

I
FAIL
TO

BIZARRELY
CRACKED

ON
MSG
LOOK
UP
ALMOST
ANYTHING
BY
JOHN
W
OLNEY
A
TOXICOLOGIST
WHO
HAS
STUDIED
THE
EFFECTS
OF
MSG
ON
THE
BRAIN
AND
ON
DEVELOPMENT
IT
IS
UNDISPUTED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
MSG
IS
AN
EXCITOTOXIC
FOOD
ADDITIVE
NO
ITS
UNDISPUTED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
GLUTAMATE
IS
AN
AMINO
ACID
WHICH
IS
AN
EXCITATORY
NEUROTRANSMITTER
THERE
IS
ALSO
EVIDENCE
THAT
EXCESSIVE
RELEASE
OF
GLUTAMATE
MAY
BE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PATHOLOGY
OF
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
LIKE
STROKE
DROWNING
AND
LOU
GEHRIGS
DISEASE
JUST
TO
NAME
A
FEW
THIS
IS
A
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
ISSUE
THAN
THE
USE
OF
THIS
UBIQUITOUS
AMINO
ACID
IN

PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
RECEIVING
INTRAVENTRICULAR
INJECTIONS
OF

HAVE
BEEN

ON

MONKEYS
AS
WELL
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A

WHERE
THE

OF
ADMINISTRATION
WAS
INTRAVENTRICULAR
THE
GLU
AND
ASP
WERE
ADMINISTERED
ORALLY
SOME

USED
IV
AND
SC
INTRAVENTRICULAR
IS
NOT
A
NORMAL
ADMIN
METHOD

FOR
OBVIOUS
REASONS
YOU
MUST
NOT

THE
PEERREVIEWED

I
REFERRED

YOU
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
COME
UP
WITH
THIS
BRAIN
INJECTION
BUNK
TOO
MUCH
IN
THE
DIET
AND
THE
SYSTEM
GETS
THROWN
OFF
SEZ
YOU
SUCH
AN
EFFECT
IN
HUMANS
HAS
NOT
BEEN
DEMONSTRATED
IN
ANY
CONTROLLED
STUDIES
INFANT
MICE
AND
OTHER
MODELS
ARE
USEFUL
AS
FAR
AS
THEY
GO
BUT
THEYRE
NOT
RELEVANT
TO
THE
MATTER
AT
HAND
WHICH
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
I
FAVOR
ITS
USE
IN
THINGS
LIKE
BABY
FOODA
PATENTLY
RIDICULOUS
USE
OF
THE
ADDITIVE
BUT
WE
HAVE
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
MSG
IN
THE

EFFECTS
HUMANS
ADVERSELY
PARDON
ME
BUT
WHERE
ARE
YOU
GETTING
THIS
FROM
HAVE
YOU
READ
THE
JOURNALS
HAVE
YOU
DONE
A
THOROUGH
LITERATURE
SEARCH
BUT
YOURE
RIGHT
MICE
ARENT
THE
BEST
TO
STUDY
THIS
ON
THEYRE
FOUR
TIMES
LESS
SENSITIVE
THAN
HUMANS
TO
MSG
GLUTAMATE
AND
ASPARTATE
ALSO
AN
EXCITOTOXIN
ARE
NECESSARY
IN
SMALL
AMOUNTS
AND
ARE
FREELY
AVAILABLE
IN
MANY
FOODS
BUT
THE
AMOUNTS
ADDED
BY
INDUSTRY
ARE
FAR
ABOVE
THE
AMOUNTS
THAT
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
ENCOUNTERED
IN
A
NY
SINGLE
FOOD
WRONG
DO
YOU
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
ASPARTATE
OR
PHENYLALANINE
IS
IN
A

MILLIGRAMS
WORTH
COMPARE
THAT
TO
A
GLASS

DO
YOU
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
GLUTAMATE
IS
PRESENT
IN
MOST
PROTEINCONTAINING
FOODS
COMPARED
TO
THAT
ADDED
BY
THE
USE
OF

THE
POINT
IS
EXCEEDING
THE

OF

THEYRE
