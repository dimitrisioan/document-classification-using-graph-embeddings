maybe
you
missed
it
amidst
the
flurry
of
responses
you
mean
the
responses
some
of
which
pointed
to
doubleblind
tests
which
show
no
such
chinese
restaurant
effect
unique
to
msg
its
elicited
by
the
placebo
as
well
many
people
responded
with
more
anecdotal
stories
i
think
its
safe
to
say
the
original
poster
is
already
familiar
with
such
stories
presumably
he
wants
hard
info
to
substantiate
or
refute
claims
about
msg
making
people
ill
similarly
debunking
such
claims
without
doing
research
whether
literature
and
lab
is
equally
beside
the
point
the
original
poster
no
doubt
already
knows
that
some
people
think
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
is
bogus
placebos
are
all
very
interesting
but
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
what
effects
msg
has
you
could
have
real
effects
and
placebo
effects
people
may
have
allergies
in
addition
yet
again
the
use
of
this
newsgroup
is
hampered
by
people
not
restricting
their
posts
to
matters
they
have
substantial
knowledge
of
like
youself
someone
who
can
read
a
scientific
paper
and
apparently
come
away
from
it
with
bizarrely
cracked
ideas
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
this
substance
in
human
nutrition
have
you
read
olneys
work
i
fail
to
see
how
citing
results
from
peerreviewed
studies
qualifies
as
bizarrely
cracked
for
cites
on
msg
look
up
almost
anything
by
john
w
olney
a
toxicologist
who
has
studied
the
effects
of
msg
on
the
brain
and
on
development
it
is
undisputed
in
the
literature
that
msg
is
an
excitotoxic
food
additive
no
its
undisputed
in
the
literature
that
glutamate
is
an
amino
acid
which
is
an
excitatory
neurotransmitter
there
is
also
evidence
that
excessive
release
of
glutamate
may
be
involved
in
the
pathology
of
certain
conditions
like
stroke
drowning
and
lou
gehrigs
disease
just
to
name
a
few
this
is
a
completely
different
issue
than
the
use
of
this
ubiquitous
amino
acid
in
foods
people
are
not
receiving
intraventricular
injections
of
glutamate
tests
have
been
done
on
rhesus
monkeys
as
well
i
have
never
seen
a
study
where
the
mode
of
administration
was
intraventricular
the
glu
and
asp
were
administered
orally
some
studies
used
iv
and
sc
intraventricular
is
not
a
normal
admin
method
for
food
tox
studies
for
obvious
reasons
you
must
not
have
read
the
peerreviewed
works
that
i
referred
to
or
you
would
never
have
come
up
with
this
brain
injection
bunk
too
much
in
the
diet
and
the
system
gets
thrown
off
sez
you
such
an
effect
in
humans
has
not
been
demonstrated
in
any
controlled
studies
infant
mice
and
other
models
are
useful
as
far
as
they
go
but
theyre
not
relevant
to
the
matter
at
hand
which
is
not
to
say
that
i
favor
its
use
in
things
like
baby
fooda
patently
ridiculous
use
of
the
additive
but
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
msg
in
the
diet
effects
humans
adversely
pardon
me
but
where
are
you
getting
this
from
have
you
read
the
journals
have
you
done
a
thorough
literature
search
but
youre
right
mice
arent
the
best
to
study
this
on
theyre
four
times
less
sensitive
than
humans
to
msg
glutamate
and
aspartate
also
an
excitotoxin
are
necessary
in
small
amounts
and
are
freely
available
in
many
foods
but
the
amounts
added
by
industry
are
far
above
the
amounts
that
would
normally
be
encountered
in
a
ny
single
food
wrong
do
you
know
how
much
aspartate
or
phenylalanine
is
in
a
soft
drink
milligrams
worth
compare
that
to
a
glass
of
milk
do
you
know
how
much
glutamate
is
present
in
most
proteincontaining
foods
compared
to
that
added
by
the
use
of
msg
the
point
is
exceeding
the
window
of
course
theyre
amino
acids
note
that
people
with
pku
cannot
tolerate
any
phenylalanine
olneys
research
compared
infant
human
diets
specifically
the
amount
of
freely
available
glu
in
mothers
milk
versus
commercial
baby
foods
vs
typical
lunch
items
from
the
standard
american
diet
such
as
packaged
soup
mixes
he
found
that
one
could
exceed
the
projected
safety
margin
for
infant
humans
by
at
least
fourfold
in
a
single
meal
of
processed
foods
mothers
milk
was
well
below
the
effective
dose
read
olneys
review
paper
in
prog
brain
res
and
check
his
sources
they
are
impecable
there
is
no
dispute
impeccable
there
most
certainly
is
a
dispute
between
who
over
what
i
would
be
most
interested
in
seeing
you
provide
peerreviewed
nonfoodindustryfunded
citations
to
articles
disputing
that
msg
has
no
effects
whatsoever
