ANTIHISTAMINE
FOR
SLEEP
AID
FOR
A
VERY
LONG
TIME
IVE
HAD
A
PROBLEM
WITH
FEELING
REALLY
AWFUL
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
GET
UP
IN
THE
MORNING
MY
SLEEP
LATENCY
AT
NIGHT
IS
ALSO
PRETTY
LONG
RANGING
FROM
MIN
TO
AN
HOUR
I
GET
ABOUT
HOURS
OF
BEDTIME
MAYBE
OF
ACTUAL
SLEEP
A
NIGHT
AND
MORE
ON
THE
WEEKENDS
I
WILL
SPEND
TWO
OR
THREE
HOURS
LAYING
IN
BED
AFTER
THIS
IF
I
CAN
BECAUSE
I
FEEL
SO
TIRED
WHEN
I
WAKE
UP
EVEN
MORE
TIRED
THAN
I
WAS
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
BED
WHICH
IS
USUALLY
TOO
TIRED
TO
WORK
ANYWAY
I
RECENTLY
HAD
A
REALLY
BAD
FLU
SO
I
CALLED
A
FRIEND
TO
GET
ME
SOME
COUGH
SYRUP
WITH
BOTH
AN
EXPECTORANT
AND
A
NASAL
DECONGESTANT
BUT
HE
GOT
VICKS
FORMULA
WHICH
HAS
EVERYTHING
BUT
AN
EXPECTORANT
SO
I
USED
THAT
ANYWAY
AND
THE
THREE
NIGHTS
I
USED
IT
I
FELL
ASLEEP
RAPIDLY
AND
FELT
THAT
I
GOT
REALLY
GOOD
QUALITY
SLEEP
THAT
IS
I
ACTUALLY
FELT
REFRESHED
THE
NEXT
MORNING
SO
I
AM
NOW
TRYING
TO
LOOK
INTO
BOTH
IN
THE
LITERATURE
AND
EXPERIMENTALLY
THE
USE
OF
ANTIHISTAMINES
AS
SLEEP
AIDS
SINCE
I
AM
PRESUMING
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
ANTIHISTAMINE
THAT
CAUSED
THE
EFFECT
THE
ANTIHISTAMINE
IN
VICKS
FORMULA
IS
CHLORIPHENAMINE
MALEATE
SO
I
BOUGHT
SOME
GENERIC
TABLETS
OF
THAT
AND
TRIED
ONE
LAST
NIGHT
AND
DIDNT
NOTICE
ANY
IMPROVEMENT
I
MIGHT
TRY
ONE
WITH
A
LITTLE
ALCOHOL
ABOUT
BEER
TO
SEE
IF
IT
IS
A
SYNERGISM
EFFECT
ALSO
LIBRARY
RESEARCH
SEEMS
TO
SHOW
THAT
BENADRYL
IS
THE
ANTIHISTAMINE
WITH
THE
STRONGEST
SEDATIVE
EFFECT
OF
WHAT
IS
AVAILIBLE
OTC
SO
I
MIGHT
ALSO
BUY
A
GENERIC
FORM
OF
THAT
AND
TRY
THAT
THE
PDR
SEEMS
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
MG
IS
A
GOOD
DOSAGE
LEVEL
TO
TRY
FOR
OTHER
MEDICAL
INFORMATION
I
HAVE
ALLERGIES
BUT
RARELY
HAVE
AN
ALLERGIC
REACTION
LIVING
IN
NEW
MEXICO
I
ALSO
HAVE
CHRONICALLY
DRY
EYES
WHICH
GET
HORRIBLE
IF
I
TRY
TO
USE
MOST
UNDERARM
DEODERANTS
I
DID
GUESS
THAT
MY
PROBLEM
MIGHT
BE
CAUSED
BY
HYPOGLYCEMIA
SO
I
MADE
SOME
CHANGES
IN
MY
DIET
CONSISTENT
WITH
THAT
AND
IT
DIDNT
HELP
SO
I
WENT
BACK
TO
A
NORMAL
DIET
PRETTY
DIVERSE
ALSO
TAKING
VITAMIN
SUPPLEMENTS
ANYWAY
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
ADVICE
FOR
THE
USE
OF
ANTIHISTAMINES
AS
SLEEP
AIDS
AND
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
DANGERS
OF
SUCH
USE
SEEMS
SAFE
TO
ME
SINCE
THEY
ARE
USED
CHRONICALLY
FOR
ALLERGIES
BY
MILLIONS
I
DONT
WANT
TO
TRY
BZS
BECAUSE
BZ
ADDICTION
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
SERIOUS
THREAT
AND
FROM
WHAT
I
HEAR
BZ
SLEEP
QUALITY
IS
NOT
GOOD
WHEREAS
ANTIHISTAMINE
SLEEP
QUALITY
SEEMS
TO
BE
BETTER
FOR
ME
I
HAVE
TRIED
SOME
DIETARY
TRYPTOPHAN
LOADING
STUFF
AND
THAT
ALSO
SEEMS
TO
LOWER
SLEEP
QUALITY
I
SEEM
TO
WAKE
UP
AROUND
OR
SO
AND
BE
IN
SOME
KIND
OF
MENTAL
HAZE
UNTIL
OR
ALSO
I
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
IN
ANY
OTHER
ADVICE
FOR
HELPING
MY
PROBLEM
ALTHOUGH
IVE
ALREADY
TRIED
MANY
OF
THE
NONPHARMACOLOGICAL
SOLUTIONS
