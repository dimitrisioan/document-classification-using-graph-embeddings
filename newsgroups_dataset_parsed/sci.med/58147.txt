MYSTERY
ILLNESS
WITH
SPOTS
I
ATTENDED
HIGH
SCHOOL
IN
THE
SAN
JOSE
CALIFORNIA
AREA
IN
THE
EARLY
AND
I
REMEMBER
A
SMALLISH
OUTBREAK
OF
A
STRANGE
ILLNESS
IN
WHICH
PEOPLE
DEVELOPED
MEASLESLIKE
SPOTS
ON
THEIR
BODIES
THIS
CONDITION
SEEMED
TO
LAST
ONLY
A
FEW
DAYS
AND
I
DONT
RECALL
ANYONE
REPORTING
ANY
OTHER
SYMPTOMS
I
SEEM
TO
RECALL
READING
SOMEWHERE
THAT
THIS
WAS
BELIEVED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
VIRAL
IN
NATURE
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
FOR
SURE
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
BEEN
CURIOUS
SINCE
THEN
ABOUT
THIS
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEAS
ABOUT
WHAT
THIS
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
