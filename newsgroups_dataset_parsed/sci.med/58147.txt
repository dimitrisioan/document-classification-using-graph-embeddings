mystery
illness
with
spots
i
attended
high
school
in
the
san
jose
california
area
in
the
early
and
i
remember
a
smallish
outbreak
of
a
strange
illness
in
which
people
developed
measleslike
spots
on
their
bodies
this
condition
seemed
to
last
only
a
few
days
and
i
dont
recall
anyone
reporting
any
other
symptoms
i
seem
to
recall
reading
somewhere
that
this
was
believed
to
have
been
viral
in
nature
but
i
dont
know
for
sure
however
i
have
been
curious
since
then
about
this
anyone
have
any
ideas
about
what
this
might
have
been
