CAN
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
TELL
ME
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
PERSISTENT
DISEASE
AND
A
CHRONIC
ONE
FOR
EXAMPLE
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
VS
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
IS
A
GENERAL
DISTINCTION
RATHER
THERE
ARE
TWO
CLASSES
OF
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
AND
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
I
CANT
THINK
OF
ANY
OTHER
DISEASE
WHERE
THE
TERM
PERSISTENT
IS
USED
WITH
OR
IN
PREFERENCE
TO
CHRONIC
MUCH
AS
THESE
TWO
TERMS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
AND
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
SOUND
FUZZY
THE
ACTUAL
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
CONDITIONS
IS
OFTEN
FAIRLY
FUZZY
AS
WELL
I
BEG
TO
DIFFER
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
IMPLIES
THAT
THE
DISEASE
REMAINS
ACTIVE
AND
GENERALLY
LEADS
TO
LIVER
FAILURE
AT
THE
VERY
MINIMUM
THE
PATIENT
HAS
PERSISTENTLY
ELEVATED
LIVER
ENZYMES
WHAT
SOME
CALL
TRANSAMINITIS
CHRONIC
PERSISTANT
HEPATITIS
SIMPLY
MEANS
THAT
THE
PATIENT
HAS
HBSAG
IN
HISHER
BLOOD
AND
CAN
TRANSMIT
THE
INFECTION
BUT
SHOWS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
PROGRESSIVE
DISEASE
IF
I
HAD
TO
CHOOSE
ID
MUCH
RATHER
HAVE
THE
PERSISTANT
TYPE
BEING
A
CHRONIC
HBSAG
CARRIER
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
THE
PATIENT
HAS
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
ANYTHING
PERSONS
WHO
ARE
CHRONIC
CARRIERS
MAY
HAVE
NO
CLINICAL
BIOCHEMICAL
OR
HISTOLOGIC
EVIDENCE
OF
LIVER
DISEASE
OR
THEY
MAY
HAVE
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
CIRRHOSIS
OR
HEPATOCELLULAR
CARCINOMA
MOST
CASES
OF
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
CPH
ARE
PROBABLY
THE
RESULT
OF
A
VIRAL
INFECTION
ALTHOUGH
IN
A
GOOD
NUMBER
OF
CASES
THE
CAUSE
CANNOT
BE
DETERMINED
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CPH
IS
MADE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
LIVER
BIOPSY
IT
CONSISTS
OF
FINDINGS
OF
PORTAL
INFLAMMATION
AN
INTACT
PERIPORTAL
LIMITING
PLATE
AND
ON
OCCASION
ISOLATED
FOCI
OF
INTRALOBULAR
NECROSIS
BUT
IN
CONTRAST
TO
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
CAH
THERE
IS
NO
PERIPORTAL
INFLAMMATION
BRIDGING
NECROSIS
OR
FIBROSIS
CPH
HAS
INDEED
AN
EXCELLENT
PROGNOSIS
IF
I
HAD
TO
CHOOSE
BETWEEN
CAH
AND
CPH
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
I
WOULD
ALSO
CHOOSE
CPH
HOWEVER
AS
DAVID
POINTED
OUT
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
IS
NOT
AS
NEAT
AS
SOME
OF
US
WOULD
HAVE
IT
THE
HISTOLOGY
CAN
SOMETIMES
BE
PRETTY
EQUIVOCAL
WITH
BIOPSIES
SHOWING
AREAS
COMPATIBLE
WITH
BOTH
CPH
AND
CAH
MAYBE
IT
IS
A
SAMPLING
PROBLEM
MAYBE
IT
IS
A
CONTINUUM

DONT
KNOW
