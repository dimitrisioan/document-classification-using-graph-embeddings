THERE
IS
A

THE

THE

I

AGREE

HOWEVER
THE

THE

IN

SINCE

ADDRESSED
THESE

IN

IN
THE
NOT
TOO
DISTANT
PAST
I
WONT
GO
INTO
THEM
AGAIN
NOW
WHAT
IS
WRONG
WITH
THE
ABOVE
OBSERVATION
IS
THAT
IT
EXPLICITLY
GIVES
THE
IMPRESSION
AND
YOU
MAY
NOT
IN
FACT
HOLD
THIS
VIEW
THAT
THE
COMMON
PERHAPS
EVEN
THE
CORRECT
APPROACH
FOR
A
SCIENTIST
TO
FOLLOW
IS
TO
SIT
AROUND
HAVING
FLIGHTS
OF
FANCY
AND
SCHEMING
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
HIS
JEALOUSIES
AND
PETTY
HATREDS
IT
FURTHER
AT
LEAST
IMPLICITLY
ADVANCES
THE
POSITION
THAT
SCIENCES
GOES
FORWARD
AND
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
GIVEN
THE
CONTEXT
IN
WHICH
IT
OCCURS
BY
GENERATING
IN
A
COMPLETELY
NONRATIONAL
AND
EVEN
RANDOM
WAY
A
PLETHORA
OF
HYPOTHESES
AND
THEORIES
THAT
ARE
THEN
WEEDED
OUT
VIA
THE
CRITICAL
FUNCTION
OF
SCIENCE
THOUGH
WHY
THIS
CRITICAL
FUNCTION
SHOULD
BE
LESS
SUBJECT
TO
THE
NONRATIONAL
FORCES
IS
A
MYSTERY
IF
EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
HYPOTHESES
CREATION
AND
THEORY
CONSTRUCTION
ARE
SUBJECT
TO
JEALOUSIES
AND
PETTY
HATREDS
THEN
THIS
MUST
BE
EQUALLY
TRUE
OF
THE
APPLICATION
OF
ANY
CRITICAL
FUNCTION
CONCERNING
REPLICATION
THIS
IS
WHAT
LEADS

ANYTHING

THE

PART
CAN
BE
TOTALLY
IRRATIONAL

TYPICALLY
IT
IS
