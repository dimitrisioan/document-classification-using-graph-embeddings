CAN
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
TELL
ME
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
PERSISTENT
DISEASE
AND
A
CHRONIC
ONE
FOR
EXAMPLE
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
VS
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
IS
A
GENERAL
DISTINCTION
RATHER
THERE
ARE
TWO
CLASSES
OF
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
AND
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
I
CANT
THINK
OF
ANY
OTHER
DISEASE
WHERE
THE
TERM
PERSISTENT
IS
USED
WITH
OR
IN
PREFERENCE
TO
CHRONIC
MUCH
AS
THESE
TWO
TERMS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
AND
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
SOUND
FUZZY
THE
ACTUAL
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
CONDITIONS
IS
OFTEN
FAIRLY
FUZZY
AS
WELL
