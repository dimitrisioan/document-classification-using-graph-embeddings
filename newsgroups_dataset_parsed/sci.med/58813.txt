CONTACTS
AFTER
RKPRK
I
LOVE
THE
FAQ
THE
COMMENT
ABOUT
CONTACT
LENSES
NOT
BEING
AN
OPTION
FOR
ANY
REMAINING
CORRECTION
AFTER
RK
AND
POSSIBLY
AFTER
PRK
IS
INTERRESTING
WHY
IS
THIS
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
FOR
SURE
WHETHER
THIS
APPLIES
TO
PRK
AS
WELL
ALSO
WHY
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
GET
A
CORRECTION
IN
PRK
WITH
INVOLVEMENT
OF
ONLY
ABOUT
OF
THE
CORNEAL
DEPTH
WHILE
RK
IS
DONE
TO
A
DEPTH
OF
UP
TO
WHY
SUCH
A
DIFFERENCE
I
THOUGHT
THE
PROCEEDURES
WERE
SIMMILAR
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
A
LASER
BEING
THE
CUTTING
TOOL
IN
PRK
I
MUST
NOT
BE
UNDERSTANDING
ALL
OF
THE
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
FAQ
THE
VISION
WAS
CONSIDERED
LESS
CLEAR
AFTER
THE
SURGERY
THAN
WITH
GLASSES
ALONE
IF
THIS
IS
COMPLETLY
ATTRIBUTABLE
TO
THE
INTENTIONAL
SLIGHT
UNDERCORRECTION
THEN
IT
CAN
BE
COMPENSATED
FOR
WHEN
NECESSARY
WITH
GLASSES
OR
CONTACTS
IF
THEY
CAN
BE
WORN
AFTERALL
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
KNOW
IF
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
HOWEVER
AND
SOME
OTHER
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
SURGERY
WOULD
OFTEN
INTERFERE
WITH
CLEAR
VISION
THE
FIRST
THING
THAT
CAME
TO
MY
MIND
WAS
A
FOGGING
OF
THE
LENSE
WHICH
GLASSES
COULDNT
HELP
WOULD
NOT
HELP
