someone
i
know
has
recently
been
diagnosed
as
having
candida
albicans
a
disease
about
which
i
can
find
no
information
apparently
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
bodys
production
of
yeast
while
at
the
same
time
being
highly
allergic
to
yeast
can
anyone
out
there
tell
me
any
more
about
it
candida
albicans
can
cause
severe
lifethreatening
infections
usually
in
people
who
are
otherwise
quite
ill
this
is
not
however
the
sort
of
illness
that
you
are
probably
discussing
systemic
yeast
syndrome
where
the
body
is
allergic
to
yeast
is
considered
a
quack
diagnosis
by
mainstream
medicine
there
is
a
book
the
yeast
connection
which
talks
about
this
illness
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
that
such
a
disease
exists
theres
a
lot
of
evidence
it
just
hasnt
been
adequately
gathered
and
published
in
a
way
that
will
convince
the
diehard
melancholic
skeptics
who
quiver
everytime
the
word
anecdote
or
empirical
is
used
for
example
dr
ivker
who
wrote
the
book
sinus
survival
always
gives
before
any
other
treatment
a
systemic
antifungal
such
as
nizoral
to
his
new
patients
if
theyve
been
on
braodspectrum
antibiotics
or
more
times
in
the
last
two
years
hes
kept
a
record
of
the
results
and
for
over
patients
found
that
over
of
his
patients
get
significant
relief
of
allergicsinus
symptoms
of
course
this
is
only
the
beginning
for
his
program
in
my
case
as
i
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
developing
the
classic
symptoms
outlined
in
the
yeast
connection
i
agree
it
is
a
poorly
written
book
eg
extreme
sensitivity
to
plastics
vapors
etc
which
i
never
had
before
started
in
november
within
one
week
of
full
dosage
of
sporanox
the
sensitivity
to
chemicals
has
fully
disappeared
i
can
now
sit
on
my
couch
at
home
without
dying
after
two
minutes
im
also
greatly
improved
in
other
areas
as
well
of
course
i
have
allergy
symptoms
etc
i
am
especially
allergic
to
molds
yeasts
etc
it
doesnt
take
a
rocket
scientist
to
figure
out
that
if
one
has
excessive
colonization
of
yeast
in
the
body
and
you
have
a
natural
allergy
to
yeasts
that
a
threshold
would
be
reached
where
you
would
have
perceptible
symptoms
also
yeast
do
produce
toxins
of
various
sorts
and
again
you
dont
have
to
be
a
rocket
scientist
to
realize
that
such
toxins
can
cause
problems
in
some
people
in
my
case
it
was
sinus
since
thats
the
center
of
my
allergic
response
of
course
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
is
immune
compromised
as
tests
showed
i
was
from
over
years
of
antibiotics
nutritionallydeficiencies
because
of
the
stress
of
infections
and
allergies
etc
can
develop
excessive
yeast
colonization
somewhere
in
the
body
it
is
a
tough
question
to
answer
since
testing
for
excessive
yeast
colonization
is
not
easy
one
almost
has
to
take
an
empirical
approach
to
diagnosis
fortunately
sporanox
is
relatively
safe
unlike
past
antifungals
still
have
to
be
careful
however
so
theres
no
reason
any
longer
to
withhold
sporanox
treatment
for
empirical
reasons
btw
some
would
say
to
try
nystatin
unfortunately
most
yeast
grows
hyphae
too
deep
into
tissue
for
nystatin
to
have
any
permanent
affect
youll
find
a
lot
of
people
who
are
on
nystatin
all
the
time
in
summary
i
appreciate
all
of
the
attempts
by
those
who
desire
to
keep
medicine
on
the
right
road
but
methinks
that
some
who
hold
too
firmly
to
the
party
line
are
academics
who
havent
been
in
the
trenches
long
enough
actually
treating
patients
if
anybody
doctors
included
said
to
me
to
my
face
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
yeast
connection
i
cannot
guarantee
their
safety
for
their
incompetence
ripping
off
their
lips
is
justified
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
