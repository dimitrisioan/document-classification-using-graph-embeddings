APPROACH
TO
SCIENCE
PROMOTES
WHAT
I
THINK
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
SIGNIFICANT
ERRORS
IN
SCIENCE
CHOOSING
TO
INVESTIGATE
QUESTIONS
BECAUSE
THEY
CAN
BE
READILY
HANDLED
BY
THE
CURRENTLY
FASHIONABLE
METHODOLOGY
OR
BECAUSE
ONE
CAN
READILY
GET
INSTITUTIONAL
OR
CORPORATE
SPONSORSHIP
FOR
THEM
INSTEAD
OF
DIRECTING
ATTENTION
TO
THOSE
QUESTIONS
WHICH
SEEM

HAVE
FUNDAMENTAL

THATS
EXACTLY
THE
WAY
MANY
WORKERS
HAVE
DESCRIBED
THEIR
MISGIVINGS
ABOUT
THE
HUMAN

PROJECT
IF

TAKE
A
RIGID
DEFINITION
OF
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH
THE
MERE
ACCUMULATION
OF

IS
NOT
DOING
SCIENCE
ONE
OF
THE
EARLY
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
THE
PROJECT
WERE
THAT
THE
RESOURCES
WOULD
BE
BETTER
USED
TO
FOCUS
ON
SPECIFIC
GENETICSRELATED
PROBLEMS
RATHER
THAN
JUST
GOING
OFF
AND
COLLECTING

AND

THE
PROJECT
CANT
BE
SO
NARROWLY
DEFINED
OR
EASILY
DESCRIBED
NOW
THOUGH
