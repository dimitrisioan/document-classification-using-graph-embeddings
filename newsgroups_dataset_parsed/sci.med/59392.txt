RE
MED
SCHOOL
ADMISSION
IM
A
FELLOW
APPLICANT
AND
MY
SITUATION
IS
NOT
TOO
MUCH
BETTER
I
APPLIED
TO
ABOUT
SCHOOLS
GOT
TWO
INTERVIEWS
GOT
ONE
OFFER
AND
AM
WAITING
TO
HEAR
FROM
THE
OTHER
SCHOOL
LET
ME
BE
HONEST
ABOUT
MY
EXPERIENCES
AND
IMPRESSIONS
ABOUT
THE
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
ADMISSIONS
PROCESS
NUMBERS
GPA
MCATS
ARE
NOT
EVERYTHING
BUT
THEY
ARE
PROBABLY
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
IN
FACT
SOME
SCHOOLS
SCREEN
OUT
APPLICANTS
BASED
ON
THESE
NUMBERS
AND
NEVER
EVEN
LOOK
AT
YOUR
OTHER
QUALITIES
OF
COURSE
WHEN
THIS
HAPPENS
DONT
EXPECT
A
REFUND
ON
YOUR
APPLICATION
FEE
BUT
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
GOT
FOUR
INTERVIEWS
TELLS
ME
THAT
YOU
HAVE
THE
NUMBERS
AND
ARE
VERY
WELL
QUALIFIED
ACADEMICALLY
YOU
MENTIONED
ONE
RESPONSE
WAS
IT
AN
ACCEPTANCE
DENIAL
OR
WAITLIST
IF
I
ASSUME
THE
WORST
THAT
IT
WAS
A
DENIAL
THEN
YOU
STILL
HAVE
A
GREAT
PROBABILITY
OF
ACCEPTANCE
SOMEWHERE
HOW
DID
YOUR
INTERVIEWS
GO
AS
FOR
HOW
LONG
YOU
HAVE
TO
WAIT
IVE
CALLED
A
FEW
SCHOOLS
WHO
NEVER
CONTACTED
ME
FOR
ANYTHING
MANY
OF
THEM
TOLD
ME
THAT
THE
INTERVIEW
SEASON
FOR
THEM
WAS
OVER
AND
THAT
IF
I
HAVENT
HEARD
BY
NOW
I
CAN
ASSUME
A
DENIAL
MANY
REJECTION
LETTERS
ARE
NOT
SENT
OUT
UNTIL
MAY
OR
AS
LATE
AS
JUNE
BUT
SOME
SCHOOLS
ARE
STILL
INTERVIEWING
I
REALLY
DONT
THINK
YOU
SHOULD
WORRY
DONT
BECOME
FIXATED
ON
THE
MAILBOX
GO
OUT
HAVE
FUN
BE
VERY
PROUD
OF
YOURSELF
WHAT
DO
PEOPLE
THINK
OF
THE
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
ADMISSIONS
PROCESS
I
HAD
A
VERY
MEDIOCRE
GPA
BUT
HIGH
MCAT
SCORES
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
WORKING
AS
A
SOFTWARE
ENGINEER
FOR
TWO
YEARS
I
MAJORED
IN
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
AT
STANFORD
STILL
I
THINK
THE
PROFILE
OF
THE
PERSON
WHO
HAS
THE
BEST
CHANCE
OF
GETTING
ADMITTED
IS
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
VERY
IMPORTANT
GPA
OR
BETTER
MCAT
TOP
IN
ALL
SUBJECT
MEDIUM
IMPORTANCE
WRITINGSPEAKING
ABILITY
MATURITY
MOTIVATION
FOR
GOING
INTO
MEDICINE
ACTIVITIES
LESS
IMPORTANT
COLLEGE
OR
UNIVERSITY
MAJOR
WORK
EXPERIENCE
ANYTHING
ELSE
YOU
WANT
THEM
TO
KNOW
ANYWAY
YOU
ARE
IN
GOOD
SHAPE
I
THINK
ADMISSIONS
COMMITTEES
ARE
BOUND
IN
MANY
WAYS
BY
THE
NUMBERS
BUT
WOULD
LIKE
VERY
MUCH
TO
UNDERSTAND
EACH
PERSON
AS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
SOMETIMES
THATS
JUST
NOT
PRACTICAL
BUT
GETTING
FOUR
INTERVIEWS
IS
AN
INDICATOR
THAT
YOU
HAVE
THE
NUMBERS
HOPEFULLY
YOU
WERE
ABLE
TO
IMPRESS
THEM
WITH
YOUR
CHARACTER
GOOD
LUCK
