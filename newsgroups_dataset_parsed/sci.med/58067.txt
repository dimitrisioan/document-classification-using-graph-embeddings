i
have
a
very
oily
skin
my
problem
is
when
i
wash
my
face
it
becomes
oily
in
half
an
hour
especially
in
the
nose
region
is
this
an
illness
how
can
i
prevent
it
from
occuring
in
such
short
time
is
there
a
cleanser
out
there
that
will
do
a
better
job
that
is
after
cleaning
my
face
wont
become
oily
in
such
a
short
time
i
dont
think
thats
a
problem
my
face
is
quite
oily
too
i
had
a
moderate
acne
problem
for
many
years
i
then
found
that
if
i
vigorously
scrub
my
face
with
a
nail
brush
and
soap
irish
spring
twice
a
day
the
acne
was
not
a
problem
i
can
still
leave
a
pretty
health
nose
print
on
a
mirror
after
min
dont
ask
but
acne
is
not
a
real
problem
anymore
