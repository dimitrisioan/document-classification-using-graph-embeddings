RE
OILY
SKIN
PROBLEM
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
I
HAVE
A
VERY
OILY
SKIN
MY
PROBLEM
IS
WHEN
I
WASH
MY
FACE
IT
BECOMES
OILY
IN
HALF
AN
HOUR
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
NOSE
REGION
IS
THIS
AN
ILLNESS
HOW
CAN
I
PREVENT
IT
FROM
OCCURING
IN
SUCH
SHORT
TIME
IS
THERE
A
CLEANSER
OUT
THERE
THAT
WILL
DO
A
BETTER
JOB
THAT
IS
AFTER
CLEANING
MY
FACE
WONT
BECOME
OILY
IN
SUCH
A
SHORT
TIME
I
DONT
THINK
THATS
A
PROBLEM
MY
FACE
IS
QUITE
OILY
TOO
I
HAD
A
MODERATE
ACNE
PROBLEM
FOR
MANY
YEARS
I
THEN
FOUND
THAT
IF
I
VIGOROUSLY
SCRUB
MY
FACE
WITH
A
NAIL
BRUSH
AND
SOAP
IRISH
SPRING
TWICE
A
DAY
THE
ACNE
WAS
NOT
A
PROBLEM
I
CAN
STILL
LEAVE
A
PRETTY
HEALTH
NOSE
PRINT
ON
A
MIRROR
AFTER
MIN
DONT
ASK
BUT
ACNE
IS
NOT
A
REAL
PROBLEM
ANYMORE
