reply
to
michael
covington
sounds
as
though
his
hearts
in
the
right
place
but
he
is
not
adept
at
expressing

what
you
received
was
meant
to
be
a
profound
apology

overworked
shy

that
the
guy
didnt
sound
too
shy
to
me
he
sounded
like
a
jerk
i

ditch
him
for
someone
more
knowledgeable
and
empathetic
