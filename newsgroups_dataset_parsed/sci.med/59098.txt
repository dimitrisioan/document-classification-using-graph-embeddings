WRITES
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
STICKY
AREAS
OF
MEDICINE
WHERE
BATTLES
FREQUENTLY
RAGE
WITH
RESPECT
TO
YOUR
OB
I
SUSPECT
THAT
SHE
HAS
BEEN
CERTIFIED
IN
ULTRASOUND
DIAGNOSTICS
AND
IS
THUS
ALLOWED
TO
USE
IT
AND
BILL
FOR
ITS
USE
MANY
CARDIOLOGISTS
ALSO
USE
ULTRASOUND
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY
AND
ARE
IN
FACT
CONSIDERED
BY
MANY
TO
BE
THE
EXPERTS
I
AM
NOT
SURE
WHERE
OBS
STAND
IN
THIS
REGARD
BUT
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THEY
ARE
AT
LEAST
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
RADIOLIGISTS

READY
IF
IT
WERE
MY
WIFE
I
WOULD
INSIST
THAT
A
RADIOLOGIST

INVOLVED
IN

INTENSIVELY
TRAINED
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
INTERPRETING
DIAGNOSTIC
IMAGING
DATA
AND

AWARE
OF
MANY
THINGS
THAT
OTHER
PHYSICIANS
ARENT
AWARE
OF
WOULD
YOU
WANT
A
RADIOLOGIST
TO
DELIVER
YOUR
BABY
IF
YOU
WOULDNT
THEN
WHY
WOULD
YOU
WANT
A
OBGYN
TO
READ
YOUR
ULTRASOUND
STUDY
IN
MY
OPINION
THE

SHOULD
INVOLVE
A
OBGYN
AND
A
RADIOLOGIST
