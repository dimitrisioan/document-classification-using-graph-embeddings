THIS

IM
POSTING
MY
ANSWER
HERE
ONLY
MEDICAL
SCHOOLS
IN
THE
US
TEACH
COURSES
ON
HUMAN
NUTRITION
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
SEEN
WHAT
A
LACK
OF
NUTRITION
EDUCATION
CAN
DO
WHEN
CANDIDA
AND
KIDNEY
STONES
PRESENT
THEMSELVES
TO
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
I
THINK
THAT
THE
BEST
EXAMPLE
OF
WHERE
US
MEDICINE
IS
REALLY
MISSING
THE
MARK
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
A
KNOWLEDGE
OF
NUTRITION
IS
PMS
SO
MANY
WOMENAND
THEIR
HUSBANDS
SUFFER
FROM
THIS
DISORDER
THAT
IT
IS
REALLY
CRIMINAL
THAT
MOST
PHYSICIANS
IN
THE
US
ARE
NOT
TAUGHT
THAT
PMS
IS
PRIMARILY
CAUSED
BY
DIET
AND
DIET
CHANGES
CAN
PREVENT
IT
FROM
EVER
HAPPPENING
BEFORE
