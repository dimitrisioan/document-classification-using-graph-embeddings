i
will
be
traveling
to
bangaldesh
this
summer
and
am
wondering
if
there
are
any
immunizations
i
should
get
before
going
you
can
probably
get
this
information
by
calling
your
public
health
department
in
your
county
in
pittsburgh
they
give
the
shots
free
as
well
there
are
bulletins
in
medical
libraries
that
give
recommendations
or
you
could
call
the
infectious
diseases
section
of
the
medicine
department
of
your
local
medical
school
you
also
will
probably
want
to
talk
about
malaria
prophylaxis
you
will
need
your
doctor
to
get
the
prescription

is
