placebo
effects
i
know
that
the
placebo
effect
is
where
a
patient
feels
better
or
even
gets
better
because
of
hisher
belief
in
the
medicine
and
the
doctor
administering
it
is
there
also
an
antiplacebo
effect
where
the
patient
dislikesdistrusts
doctors
and
medicine
and
therefore
doesnt
get
better
or
feel
better
in
spite
of
the
medicine
is
there
an
effect
where
the
doctor
believes
so
strongly
in
a
medicine
that
heshe
sees
improvement
where
the
is
none
or
sees
more
improvement
than
there
is
if
so
what
is
this
effect
called
is
there
a
reverse
of
the
above
effect
where
the
doctor
doesnt
believe
in
a
medicine
and
then
sees
less
improvement
than
there
is
what
would
this
effect
be
called
have
these
effects
ever
been
studied
how
common
are
these
effects
thank
you
in
advance
for
all
replies

is
very
valuable

disinformation
is
much
more
common
