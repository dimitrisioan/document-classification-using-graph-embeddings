USE

EVER
PRODUCE
LONGTERM
SIDEEFFECTS
AFTER
THE
USE
OF
THE
DRUG
MY
GRANDMOTHER
RECENTLY
HAD
TO
BE
HOSPITALIZED
AND
WAS
GIVEN
LARGE
DOSES
OF
HALDOL
FOR
SEVERAL
WEEKS
ALTHOUGH
THE
DRUG
HAS
BEEN
TERMINATED
SHE
HAS
CHANGED
FROM
A
PERKY
SLIGHTLY
SENILE
WOMAN
INTO
A
VIRTUAL
VEGETABLE
WHO
DOES
NOT
TALK
TO
ANYONE
AND
WHO
CANNOT
EVEN
EAT
OR
BRUSH
HER
TEETH
WITHOUT
ASSISTANCE
IT
SEEMS
INCREDIBLE
TO
ME
THAT
SUCH
CHANGES
COULD
TAKE
PLACE
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
JUST
ONE
AND
ONEHALF
MONTHS
I
HAVE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
COMBINATION
OF
THE
HOSPITAL
STAY
AND
SOME
DRUGS
ARE
IN
