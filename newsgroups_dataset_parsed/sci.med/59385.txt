RE
USE
OF
HALDOL
IN
ELDERLY
LAWRENCE
CURCIO
WROTE
IVE
SEEN
PEOPLE
IN
THEIR
FORTIES
AND
FIFTIES
BECOME
DISORIENTED
AND
DEMENTED
DURING
HOSPITAL
STAYS
IN
THE
EXAMPLES
IVE
SEEN
DRUGS
WERE
DEFINITELY
INVOLVED
MY
OWN
FATHER
TURNED
INTO
A
VEGETABLE
FOR
A
SHORT
TIME
WHILE
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
HE
WAS
FIFTYTHREE
AT
THE
TIME
AND
HE
WAS
ON
SEPARATE
MEDICATIONS
THE
FAMILY
PROTESTED
BUT
THE
DOCTORS
WERE
ADAMANT
TELLING
US
THAT
NONE
OF
THE
DRUGS
INTERACT
THEY
EVEN
TOOK
THE
ATTITUDE
THAT
IF
HE
WAS
DISORIENTED
THEY
SHOULD
PUT
HIM
ON
SOMETHING
ELSE
AS
WELL
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
AN
MD
FRIEND
OF
THE
FAMILY
WE
HAD
ALL
HIS
MEDICATION
DISCONTINUED
HE
HAD
A
SEIZURE
THAT
NIGHT
AND
WAS
PUT
BACK
ON
ONE
DRUG
TWO
DAYS
LATER
HE
WAS
HIS
OLD
SELF
AGAIN
I
GUESS
THERE
ARENT
MANY
MEDICAL
TEXTS
THAT
ADDRESS
THE
SUBJECT
OF
INTERACTIONS
I
SAW
THE
SAME
THING
HAPPEN
TO
MY
FATHER
AND
I
CAN
MORE
OR
LESS
VALIDATE
YOUR
TAKE
ON
HOSPITALS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
MEDICAL
SCIENCE
UNDERSTANDS
PRECIOUS
LITTLE
ABOUT
TAKING
CARE
OF
THE
HUMAN
MACHINE
DRUGS
ARE
GIVEN
AS
A
RESPONSE
TO
SYMPTOMS
AND
I
GUESS
THAT
MAKES
SENSE
SINCE
ALL
THE
STUDIES
THAT
VALIDATE
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
THOSE
DRUGS
ARE
BASED
ON
A
NARROW
ASSESSMENT
OF
THE
DEGREE
OF
PARTICULAR
SYMPTOMS
BUT
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
VERY
LITTLE
APPRECIATION
FOR
THE
WELLBEING
OF
A
PERSON
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
NUMBERS
THAT
APPEAR
ON
A
TEST
I
WATCHED
MY
DAD
WITHER
AWAY
AND
LOSE
HUGE
AMOUNTS
OF
BODY
FAT
AND
MUSCLES
TISSUE
WHILE
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
CRAZY
ABOUT
A
SYSTEM
IN
WHICH
THERE
IS
MORE
ATTENTION
PAID
TO
GIVING
YOU
EVERY
LATEST
DRUG
AVAILABLE
THAN
THERE
IS
ATTENTION
PAID
TO
WHETHER
YOU
HAVE
HAD
ENOUGH
TO
EAT
TO
PREVENT
LOSS
OF
MUSCLE
TISSUE
IT
IS
REALLY
REALLY
BIZARRE
