RE
SUMATRIPTON
SPELLING
REPLY
TO
ROXANNENCRUZIOSANTACRUZCAU
I
RECENTLY
HEARD
OF
SOME
TESTING
OF
A
NEW
MIGRAINE
DRUG
CALLED
SUMATRIPTON
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
OF
THE
ACTUAL
SPELLING
THAT
SUPPOSEDLY
UTILIZES
A
CHEMICAL
THAT
TRIPS
NEUROTRANSMITTERS
MY
MOTHER
HAS
REGULAR
MIGRAINES
AND
NOTHING
SEEMS
TO
HELP
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THIS
NEW
DRUG
IS
IT
IN
A
TESTING
PHAZE
OR
ANYWHERE
NEAR
APPROVAL
DOES
IT
SEEM
TO
BE
WORKING
I
JUST
GOT
BACK
FROM
THE
AMERICAN
ACADEMY
OF
NEUROLOGY
ANNUAL
MEETING
WHERE
THE
CONSENSUS
WAS
THAT
SUMATRIPTAN
IMITREX
HAS
NO
ADVANTAGES
OVER
NASAL
SPRAY
WHICH
IS
MUCH
LESS
EXPENSIVE
HAS
FEWER
SIDE
EFFECTS
IS
AS
EFFECTIVE
AND
WORKS
MORE
QUICKLY
MINUTES
VS
BESIDES
WHO
WANTS
TO
GIVE
THEMSELVES
A
SHOT
SUMATRIPTAN
WHEN
A
NASAL
SPRAY
WORKS
DHE
NASAL
SPRAY
IS
NOT
WIDELY
AVAILABLE
YET
IT
HAS
TO
BE
MAIL
ORDERED
FROM
ONE
OF
A
FEW
PHARMACIES
IN
THE
COUNTRY
BUT
MOST
NEUROLOGISTS
NOW
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
AND
KNOW
HOW
TO
ORDER
IT
