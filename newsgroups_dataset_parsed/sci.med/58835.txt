LOVE
THE
FAQ
THE
COMMENT
ABOUT
CONTACT
LENSES

BEING
AN
OPTION
FOR
ANY
REMAINING
CORRECTION

RK
AND
POSSIBLY
AFTER
PRK
IS
INTERRESTING
WHY
IS
THIS
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
FOR
SURE
WHETHER
THIS
APPLIES
TO
PRK
AS
WELL
ALSO
WHY
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
GET
A
CORRECTION
IN
PRK
WITH
INVOLVEMENT
OF
ONLY
ABOUT
OF
THE
CORNEAL
DEPTH
WHILE
RK
IS
DONE
TO
A
DEPTH
OF
UP
TO
WHY
SUCH
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
MYOPIA
THE

FROM

THE
SURGEON
CUTS
INCISIONS
NEAR
THE
EDGE

THE
SCARRING
RESHAPES
THE
CORNEA
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
MECHANISMS
AND
THE
ACTION
IS
IN
A
DIFFERENT
PLACE
