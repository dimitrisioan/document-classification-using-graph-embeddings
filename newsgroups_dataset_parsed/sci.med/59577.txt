DEADLY
NYQUIL
BITNKIMBARKUCHICAGOEDU
WRITES
MY
FRIEND
INSISTS
THAT
NYQUIL
CAN
BE
DEADLY
IF
ENOUGH
IS
TAKEN
HE
SUGGESTED
SOMETHING
LIKE
OF
THE
NIGHTTIME
GELCAPS
WOULD
DO
SOMEONE
IN
BEING
A
NORMAL
USER
OF
NYQUIL
I
CHECKED
THE
INGREDIENTS
AND
HAVE
A
VERY
HARD
TIME
BELIEVING
IT
THEY
ARE
G
ACETAMINOPHEN
MG
PSEUDOEPHEDRINE
HCL
MG
DEXTROMETHORPHAN
HBR
MG
DOXYLAMINE
SUCCINATE
PER
SOFTGEL
CAN
SOMEONE
SETTLE
OUR
BET
A
PACKAGE
OF
NYQUIL
OF
COURSE
WHAT
EFFECT
WOULD
OF
THESE
BABIES
HAVE
THE
ACETAMINOPHEN
IS
THE
AGENT
OF
CONCERN
IN
OVERDOSE
OF
THIS
OTC
MEDICATION
A
SINGLE
DOSE
OF
ACETAMINOPHEN
OF
GRAMS
OR
GREATER
CAN
CAUSE
HEPATOTOXICITY
AND
DOSES
OF
GRAMS
OR
MORE
ARE
POTENTIALLY
FATAL
FROM
HEPATIC
NECROSIS
IF
I
RECALL
CORRECTLY
THE
METABOLISM
OF
ACETAMINOPHEN
AT
HIGH
DOSES
INVOLVES
NHYDROXYLATION
TO
NACETYLBENZOQUINONEIMINE
WHICH
IS
A
HIGHLY
REACTIVE
INTERMEDIATE
WHICH
THEN
REACTS
WITH
SULFHYDRYL
GROUPS
OF
PROTEINS
AND
GLUTATHIONE
WHEN
HEPATIC
GLUTATHIONE
IS
USED
UP
THIS
INTERMEDIATE
THEN
STARTS
ATTACKING
THE
HEPATIC
PROTEINS
WITH
RESULTING
HEPATIC
NECROSIS
THE
INSIDIOUS
PART
OF
ACETAMINOPHEN
TOXICITY
IS
THE
DELAY
DAYS
BETWEEN
INGESTION
AND
CLINICAL
SIGNS
OF
LIVER
DAMAGE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
NICE
WAY
TO
DIE
AS
TO
TAKING
OF
THESE
TABLETS
THAT
COMES
TO
GRAMS
OF
ACETAMINOPHEN
IN
A
NORMAL
ADULT
THIS
WOULD
PROBABLY
CAUSE
NAUSEA
VOMITING
ABDOMINAL
PAIN
AND
LOSS
OF
APPETITE
