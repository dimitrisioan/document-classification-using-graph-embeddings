epsteinbarr
syndrome
questions
okay
this
is
a
long
shot
my
friend
robin
has
recurring
bouts
of
mononucleosistype
symptoms
very
regularly
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
number
of
years
shes
seen
a
number
of
doctors
six
was
the
last
count
i
think
most
of
them
have
said
either
you
have
mono
or
youre
full
of
it
theres
nothing
wrong
with
you
one
has
admitted
to
having
no
idea
what
was
wrong
with
her
and
one
has
claimed
that
it
is
epsteinbarr
syndrome
now
what
she
told
me
about
ebs
is
that
very
few
doctors
even
believe
that
it
exists
obviously
this
has
been
her
experience
so
whats
the
story
is
it
real
does
the
medical
profession
believe
it
to
be
real
has
anyone
had
success
is
treating
ebs
or
is
it
just
something
to
live
with
thanks
for
your
assistance
