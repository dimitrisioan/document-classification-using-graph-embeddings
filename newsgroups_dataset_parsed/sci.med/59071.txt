MSG
SENSITIVITY
SUPERSTITION
IN
ARTICLE
JCHENCTTBELLCORECOM
WRITES
THE
FUNNY
THING
IS
THE
PERSONALY
STORIES
ABOUT
REACTIONS
TO
MSG
VARY
SO
GREATLY
SOME
SAID
THAT
THEIR
HEART
BEAT
SPEEDED
UP
WITH
FLUSH
FACE
SOME
CLAIM
THEIR
HEART
SKIPPED
BEATS
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
BOTH
OF
THESE
SYMPTOMS
ARE
RELATED
TACHYCARDIA
GETTING
A
FLUSHED
FACE
IS
DUE
TO
THE
HEART
PUMPING
THE
BLOOD
FASTER
THAN
A
REGULAR
PULSE
I
SUSPECT
THIS
IS
RELATED
TO
AN
INCREASE
IN
SODIUM
LEVELS
IN
THE
BLOOD
SINCE
NOTE
SODIUM
CHLORIDE
MONOSODIUM
GLUTAMATE
BOTH
ARE
SODIUM
COMPOUNDS
OUR
BODIES
REQUIRE
SODIUM
BUT
LIKE
EVERYTHING
ELSE
ONE
CAN
GET
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
GOOD
THING
SOME
REACTED
WITH
HEADACHE
AGAIN
THIS
COULD
BE
RELATED
TO
INCREASED
BLOOD
FLOW
FROM
INCREASED
HEART
RATE
FROM
THE
SODIUM
IN
THE
MSG
DISTENDED
CRAINIAL
ARTERIES
ESSENTIALLY
ONE
OF
MANY
CAUSES
OF
HEADACHES
THERE
IS
NO
DISCREPENCY
HER
NECESSARILY
SOME
STOMACH
ACHE
WELL
STOMACHE
ACHE
AND
VOMITING
TEND
TO
BE
RELATED
AGAIN
NOT
NECESSARILY
A
DISCREPENCY
MORE
LIKELY
A
RELATED
REACTION
VOMITING
OCCURS
AS
A
RESPONSE
TO
GET
RID
OF
A
NOXIOUS
COMPOUND
AN
ORGANISM
HAS
EATEN
IF
A
PERSON
CANT
DIGEST
THE
STUFF
ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE
THE
LIST
OF
STUFF
PEOPLE
ARE
ALLERGIC
TO
IS
QUITE
LONG
AND
LACKS
AN
ENZYME
TO
BREAK
IT
DOWN
GASTROINTESTINAL
DISTRESS
STOMACH
OR
BELLY
ACHE
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
SOME
HAD
WATERY
EYES
OR
RUNNING
NOSE
THESE
ARE
RESPIRATORY
REACTIONS
AND
ARE
NOW
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
SIMILAR
TO
VOMITTING
THEY
ARE
A
WAY
FOR
THE
BODY
TO
DISPOSE
OF
NOXIOUS
COMPOUNDS
THEY
ARE
ADAPTIOVE
RESPONSES
OF
COURSE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
SOME
OTHER
FOOD
OR
ENVIRONMENTAL
COMPOUND
COULD
BE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
SYMPTOMS
BUT
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
A
LOT
OPF
THESE
EFFETS
CAN
BE
ADDITIVE
SYNERGYSTIC
SUBTRACTIVE
ETC
ETC
IT
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
TO
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
WAS
IN
A
DISH
AND
WHAT
ELSE
THE
PERSON
WAS
EXPOSED
TO
RESPIRATORY
DOES
SOUND
SUSPICIOUS
BUT
RESOPIRATION
AND
HEART
RATE
ARE
CONNECTED
THINGS
IN
THE
BODY
ARE
FAR
FROM
SIMPLEVERY
INETRACTIVE
PLACE
THE
VERTEBRATE
BODY
SOME
HAD
ITCHY
SKIN
OR
RASHES
PEOPLE
RESPOND
IN
A
MYRIAD
OF
WAYS
TO
THE
SAME
COMPOUND
IT
DEPENDS
UPON
WHAT
IT
IS
ABOUT
THE
COMPOUND
THAT
PISSES
OFF
THEIR
BODY
POLLEN
FOR
EXAMPLE
OF
SOME
PLANTS
AGGRIVATES
BREATHING
IN
MANY
PEOPLE
BECAUSE
WHEN
INHALED
IT
SETS
OF
THE
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
AND
AN
HISTAMINE
ATTACK
IS
LAUNCHED
THE
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
GOES
OVERBOARD
CAUSING
THE
ALLERGIC
PERSON
A
LOT
OF
MISERY
AND
SOMEONE
WITH
AN
ALLERGY
TO
SOME
POLLENS
WILL
HAVE
TROUBLE
WITH
SOME
HERB
TEAS
THAT
CONTAIN
POLLENS
CHAMOMILE
LINDEN
ETC
DRINKING
THE
SUBSTANCE
CAN
PERTURB
THAT
PERSONS
SYSTEM
AS
MUCH
AS
INHALING
IT
MORE
SERIOUS
ACCUSATIONS
INCLUDE
RESPIRATION
DIFFICULTY
SEE
ABOVE
AND
DONT
THINK
THAT
HEART
RATE
CHANGES
AND
CIRCULATORY
PROBLEMS
ARE
NOT
SERIOUS
THEY
CAN
BE
DEADLY
AND
BRAIN
DAMAGE
THE
AREA
OF
THE
BRAIN
EFFECTED
IS
THE
NEUROENDOCRINE
SYSTEM
CONTROLLING
THE
RELEASE
OF
GONADOTROPIN
THE
SUPRAHORMONE
CONTROLLING
THE
CYCLICAL
RELEASE
OF
TESTOSTERONE
AND
ESTRADIOL
AS
WELL
AS
SOMATOSTATIN
AND
OTHER
STEROIDS
TESTING
FOR
EFFECTIVE
DOSE
WOULD
BE
UH
A
WEE
BIT
UNETHICAL
NOW
HERE
IS
A
NEW
ONE
VOMITING
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
MSG
BECOMES
THE
NUMBER
ONE
SUSPECT
OF
ANY
PROBLEM
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
MIGHT
BE
JUST
FOOD
POISONING
ABSOLUTELY
BUT
IT
COULD
ALSO
BE
SOME
SYNERGYSTIC
MESS
FROM
EATING
SAY
UNDETECTED
SHRIMP
OR
MUSHROOMS
TO
WHICH
MANY
ARE
ALLERGIC
PLUS
TOO
MUCH
ALCOHOL
AND
INHALING
TOO
MUCH
DIESEL
FUMES
BIKING
HOME
PLUS
LETS
SAY
HAVING
CONTRACTED
FLU
FROM
ONES
SIG
OTHER
DAYS
BEFORE
FROM
DRINKING
OUT
OF
THE
SAME
GLASS
COULD
BE
ALL
SORTS
OF
THINGS
BUT
IT
MIGHT
BE
THE
MSG
IF
YOU
HEARD
THINGS
ABOUT
MSG
YOU
MAY
THINK
IT
MUST
BE
IT
IF
NOONE
ELSE
GOT
SICK
ITS
LIKELY
NOT
FOOD
POISONING
PROBABLY
STOMACH
FLU
OR
AN
UNDETECTED
THING
THE
GUYS
ALLERGIC
TO
ANYWAY
THE
HUMAN
BODYS
NOT
A
MACHINE
PEOPLE
VARY
WIDELY
IN
THEIR
RESPONSES
AND
A
LOT
OF
REACTIONS
ARE
DUE
TO
COMBINATIONS
OF
THINGS
