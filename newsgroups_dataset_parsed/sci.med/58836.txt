now
here
is
a
new
one
vomiting
my
guess
is
that
msg
becomes
the
number
one
suspect
of
any
problem
in
this
case
it
might
be
just
food
poisoning
but
if
you
heard
things
about
msg
you
may
think
it
must
be
it
yeah
it
might
if
you
only
read
the
part
you
quoted
you
somehow
left
out
the
part
about
we
all
ate
the
same
thing
changes
things
a
bit
eh
perhaps
now
just
what
leads
you
to
believe
that
it
was
msg
and
not
some
other
ingredient
in
the
food
that
made
you
ill
these
people
arent
condemning
chinese
food
mr
chen
just
one
of
its
optional
ingredients
try
not
to
take
it
so
personally
and
youre
condemning
one
particular
ingredient
without
any
evidence
that
thats
the
ingredient
to
which
you
reacted

hey
i
understand
vaxen
and
vms
thats
what
i
get
paid
for
my
understanding
of
astronomy
is
purely
at
the
amateur
level
or
below
so
unless
what
im
saying
is
directly
related
to
vaxvms
dont
hold
me
or
my
organization
responsible
for
it
if
it
is
related
to
vaxvms
you
can
try
to
hold
me
responsible
for
it
but
my
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
