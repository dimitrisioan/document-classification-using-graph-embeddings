WHAT
IS
THE
MEDICAL
TERM
FOR
THIS
SENSATION
DEAR
NETTERS
MAYBE
ONE
OF
YOU
CAN
EXPLAIN
THIS
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
I
EXPERIENCE
A
STRANGE
KIND
OF
FEELING
I
HAVE
ALL
KINDS
OF
WEIRD
FEELINGS
WHICH
CAN
BE
BEST
DESCRIBED
AS
THE
FEELING
OF
LOSING
GRAVITY
LIKE
THAT
ONE
EXPERIENCES
IN
A
DESCENDING
ELEVATOR
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
IT
IS
NOT
ENJOYABLE
IT
SOMETIMES
COMES
WITH
SHORTNESS
OF
BREATH
AND
EXTREME
FATIGUE
IT
LASTS
FROM
A
FEW
MINUTES
TO
AN
HOUR
AND
WHEN
IT
LASTS
THAT
LONG
IT
MAKES
ME
SWEATENING
INITIALLY
I
CALLED
IT
PALPITATION
SPELLING
UNTIL
I
LATER
LEARNT
THAT
THE
TERMINOLOGY
HAS
BEEN
RESERVED
FOR
THE
SELFAWARENESS
OF
HEART
BEATS
SO
IS
THERE
A
SPECIFIC
TERM
FOR
THIS
FEELING
OR
AM
I
A
STRAGNE
PERSON
I
ALWAYS
BELIEVE
I
AM
UNIQUE
THANKS
PING
