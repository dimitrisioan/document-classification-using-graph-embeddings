about
kirlian
imaging
i
believe
the
faq
for
sciskeptics
sp
has
a
nice
writeup
on
this
they
would
certainly
be
most
supportive
on
helping
you
to
build
such
a
device
and
connect
to
a
supply
so
that
you
can
take
a
serious
look
at
your
aura

cern
european
laboratory
for
particle
physics
switzerland
this
has
to
be
the
only
generally
accepted
method
of
using
common
physics
lab
equipment
to
find
certain
answers
to
all
the
questions
about
afterlifes
heavens
hells
purgatory
gods
etc
krillean
photography
will
probably
be
ignored
as
insignificant
compared
to
these
larger
eternal
verities
publishing
your
results
could
be
a
bit
of
a
problem
though
