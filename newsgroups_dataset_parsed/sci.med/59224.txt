I
HOPE
GORDON
BANKS
DID
NOT
MEAN
TO
IMPLY
THAT
NOTIONS
SUCH
AS
HARDTOSEE
CANDIDA
INFECTIONS
CAUSING
VARIOUS
PROBLEMS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
INVESTIGATED
MANY
RESEARCHERS
HAVE
MADE
BREAKTHROUGHS
BY
FIGURING
OUT
HOW
TO
INVESTIGATE
THINGS
THAT
WERE
PREVIOUSLY
THOUGHT
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TEST
FOR
INDEED
I
WOULD
BE
SURPRISED
IF
CANDIDA
OVERBLOOM
WERE
SUCH
A
PHENOMENA
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
CANDIDA
WOULD
PRODUCE
SIGNATURE
BYPRODUCTS
WHOSE
MEASURE
WOULD
THEN
SET
A
LOWER
BOUND
ON
THE
EXTENT
OF
RECENT
INFECTION
I
REALIZE
THIS
MIGHT
GET
QUITE
TRICKY
AND
DIFFICULT
PROBABLY
EXPENSIVE
AND
LIKELY
INCONVENIENT
OR
UNCOMFORTABLE
TO
THE
SUBJECTS
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
I
RECALL
READING
IN
THE
RECENTLY
REVISED
EDITION
OF
THE
YEAST
CONNECTION
THAT
THERE
IS
INDEED
WORK
BY
RESEARCHERS
TO
DO
THIS
OF
COURSE
THEY
ARE
WORKING
ON
THE
THEORY
THAT
CANDIDA
OVERBLOOM
WITH
PENETRATION
INTO
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
TISSUE
WITH
ASSOCIATED
MILD
INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE
CAN
AND
DOES
OCCUR
IN
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
IF
YOU
REJECT
THIS
YEAST
HYPOTHESIS
THEN
ID
GUESS
YOUD
VIEW
THIS
RESEARCH
AS
ONE
MORE
WASTEFUL
AND
QUIXOTIC
ENDEAVOR
STAY
TUNED
