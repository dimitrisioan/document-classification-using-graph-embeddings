imho
you
have
lyme
disease
i
sent
you
in
private
email
a
summary
of
the
treatment
protocols
put
forth
by
the
lyme
disease
foundation
i
respectfully
suggest
that
you
save
yourself
a
great
deal
of
suffering
by
contacting
them
for
a
lymeknowledgeable
physician
referral
and
seek
treatment
at
once
youll
know
in
weeks
if
youre
on
the
right
course
and
the
clock
is
ticking
on
your
weeks
if
you
have
it
if
these
folks
are
who
i
think
they
are
lymeknowledgeable
may
mean
a
physician
to
whom
everything
that
walks
in
the
door
is
lyme
disease
and
you
will
be
treated
for
lyme
whether
or
not
you
have
it
hope
you
have
good
insurance

skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and

it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
