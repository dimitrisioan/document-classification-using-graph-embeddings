one
question
i
do
have
a
doctor
who
flushed
out
my
ears
once
also
advocated
a
drop
of
rubbing
alcohol
in
them
afterwards
to
flush
out
any
remaining
trapped
water
said
he
told
swimmers
to
do
this
after
swimming
too
it
works
but
it
stings
like
the
devil
so
ive
always
been
content
to
let
any
water
in
my
ears
from
swimming
or
flushing
them
out
figure
out
how
to
get
out
by
itself
if
shaking
my
head
a
few
times
wont
do
the
trick
any
comments
perhaps
diluting
the
rubbing
alcohol
in
some
water
until
you
feels
comfortable
will
do
the
trick
