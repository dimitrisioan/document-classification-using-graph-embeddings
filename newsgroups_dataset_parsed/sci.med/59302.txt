thinking
that
education
suppliers

krillean
photography
involves
taking
pictures
of
minute
decapods
resident
in
the
seas
surrounding
the
antarctic
or
pictures
taken
by
them
perhaps
bill
from
oz
bill
no
flame
intended
but
youre
way
way
off
base
in
simple
terms
kirilian
photography
registers
the
electromagnetical
fields
around
objects
in
simple
it
takes
pictures
of
your
aura
greg
flame
definitely
intended
here
bill
was
making
fun
of
the
misspelling
go
look
up
the
word
krill
also
the
correct
spelling
is
kirlian
it
involves
taking
photographs
of
corona
discharges
created
by
attaching
the
subject
to
a
highvoltage
source
not
of
some
aura
it
works
equally
well
with
inanimate
objects

hey
i
understand
vaxen
and
vms
thats
what
i
get
paid
for
my
understanding
of
astronomy
is
purely
at
the
amateur
level
or
below
so
unless
what
im
saying
is
directly
related
to
vaxvms
dont
hold
me
or
my
organization
responsible
for
it
if
it
is
related
to
vaxvms
you
can
try
to
hold
me
responsible
for
it
but
my
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
