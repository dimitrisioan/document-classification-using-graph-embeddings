I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
ANY
INFORMATIONSUPPLIES
THAT
WILL
ALLOW
DOITYOURSELFERS
TO
TAKE
KRILLEAN
PICTURES
IM
THINKING
THAT
EDUCATION
SUPPLIERS
FOR
SCHOOLS
MIGHT
HAVE
A
APPARTUS
FOR
SALE
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
ANY
OF
THE
COMPANIES
ANY
INFO
IS
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
IN
CASE
YOU
DONT
KNOW
KRILLEAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
INVOLVES
TAKING
PICTURES
OF
AN
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
ORGANIC
OBJECT
BETWEEN
CHARGED
PLATES
THE
PICTURE
WILL
SHOW
ENERGY
PATTERNS
OR
SPIKES
AROUND
THE
OBJECT
PHOTOGRAPHED
AND
DEPENDING
ON
WHAT
TYPE
OF
OBJECT
IT
IS
THE
SPIKES
OR
ENERGY
PATTERNS
WILL
VARY
ONE
MIGHT
EXTRAPOLATE
HERE
AND
SAY
THAT
THIS
PROVES
THAT
EVERY
OBJECT
WITHIN
THE
UNIVERSE
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
HAS
ITS
OWN
ENERGY
SIGNATURE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
A
NUMBER
OF
SCIENTIFIC
PAPERS
IN
PEERREVIEWED
JOURNALS
PUBLISHED
ABOUT
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
IN
THE
EARLY
SORRY
I
CANT
BE
MORE
SPECIFIC
BUT
IT
IS
A
LONG
TIME
SINCE
I
READ
THEM
THEY
WOULD
DESCRIBE
WHAT
IS
NEEDED
AND
HOW
TO
SET
UP
THE
APPARATUS
THESE
PAPERS
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
THE
AURAS
OBTAINED
BY
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
CAN
BE
COMPLETELY
EXPLAINED
BY
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
ELECTRIC
CURRENTS
USED
ON
THE
MOISTURE
IN
THE
OBJECT
BEING
PHOTOGRAPHED
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
ENERGY
SIGNATURE
OF
ORGANIC
OBJECTS
I
DID
A
SCIENCE
PROJECT
ON
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
HIGH
SCHOOL
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
OBTAIN
WONDERFUL
AURAS
FROM
ROCKS
AND
PEBBLES
AND
THE
LIKE

FIRST

GENERALLY
