I
EXPERIENCED
A
SUDDEN
NUMBNESS
IN
MY
LEFT
ARM
THIS
MORNING
JUST
AFTER
I
COMPLETED
MY
SET
OF
DEEP
SQUATS
TODAY
WAS
MY
WEIGHT
TRAINING
DAY
AND
I
WAS
JUST
BEGINNING
MY
ROUTINE
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SET
MY
ARM
FELT
LIKE
IT
HAD
GONE
TO
SLEEP
IT
WAS
COLD
TURNED
PALE
AND
LOST
OF
ITS
STRENGTH
THE
WEIGHT
I
USED
FOR
SQUATS
WASNT
THAT
HEAVY
I
WAS
WORKING
HARD
BUT
NOT
AT
EFFORT
I
WAITED
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
TRYING
TO
SHAKE
THE
ARM
BACK
TO
LIFE
AND
THEN
CONTINUED
WITH
CHEST
EXERCISES
FLYES
WITH
LIGHTER
DUMBELLS
THAN
I
NORMALLY
USE
BUT
I
DROPPED
THE
LEFT
DUMBELL
DURING
THE
FIRST
SET
AND
EXPERIENCED
CONTINUED
ARM
WEAKNESS
INTO
THE
SECOND
SO
I
QUIT
TRAINING
AND
DECIDED
NOT
TO
DO
MY
USUAL
HOUR
ON
THE
SKI
MACHINE
EITHER
ILL
TAKE
IT
EASY
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
DAY
MY
ARM
IS
STILL
SOMEWHAT
NUMB
AND
SIGNIFICANTLY
WEAKER
THAN
NORMAL
MY
HAND
STILL
TINGLES
A
BIT
DOWN
TO
THE
THUMB
COLOR
HAS
RETURNED
TO
NORMAL
AND
IT
IS
NO
LONGER
COLD
HORRID
THOUGHTS
OF
CHUNKS
OF
PLAQUE
BLOCKING
A
MAJOR
ARTERY
COURSE
THROUGH
MY
BRAIN
IM
VEGETARIAN
AND
PRETTY
FIT
FROM
MY
DAILY
EXERCISE
REGIMEN
SO
THAT
CANT
BE
IT
COULD
A
PINCHED
NERVE
FROM
THE
BAR
CAUSE
THESE
SYMPTOMS
I
HOPE
IT
LIKELY
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
CHUNKS
OF
PLAQUE
BUT
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOU
MAY
HAVE
A
NEUROVASCULAR
COMPROMISE
TO
YOUR
ARM
AND
YOU
NEED
MEDICAL
ATTENTION
BEFORE
DOING
ANY
MORE
WEIGHT
LIFTING
GORDON
BANKS
SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND
GEBCADREDSLPITTEDU
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
