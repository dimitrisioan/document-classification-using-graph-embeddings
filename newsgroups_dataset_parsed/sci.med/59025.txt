i
believe
it
is
illegal
for
a
residency
to
discriminate
against
fmgs
is
that
true
i
know
some
that
wont
even
interview
fmgs
i
think
a
case
could
be
made
that
this
is
discriminatory
particularly
if
an
applicant
had
good
board
scores
and
recommendations
but
wasnt
offered
an
interview
but
i
dont
know
if
it
has
ever
gone
to
court
fmgs
who
are
not
citizens
are
like
all
aliens
in
a
difficult
situation
only
citizens
get
to
vote
here
so
noncitizens
are
of
little
or
no
interest
to
legislators
also
the
noncitizen
may
well
be
in
the
middle
of
processing
for
resident
alien
status
there
is
a
stron
sense
that
rocking
the
boat
eg
suing
a
residency
program
will
delay
the
granting
of
that
status
perhaps
for
ever
don
mackie
his
opinions
