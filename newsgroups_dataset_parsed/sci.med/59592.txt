COLONICS
AND
PURIFICATION
NOT
EVERYTHING
THAT
GOES
IN
COMES
OUT
AND
PERSONALY
I
DONT
MIND
GIVING
MY
BODY
A
HAND
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
JUST
MY
EXPERIENCE
GEORGE
PAAP
IVE
GOT
A
VERY
NICE
COLLECTION
OF
HISTORICAL
BOOKS
ON
MEDICAL
QUACKERY
AND
ON
THE
TOPIC
OF
MASSAGE
THIS
IS
A
RECURRING
THEME
ORDINARY
MASSAGE
IS
INTENDED
TO
MAKE
A
PERSON
FEEL
BETTER
ESPECIALLY
IF
THEY
HAVE
MUSCULAR
OR
JOINT
PROBLEMS
BUT
LIKE
CHIROPRACTY
THERE
ARE
SOME
PRACTITIONERS
WHO
TAKE
THE
TECHNIQUE
TO
A
FAR
EXTREME
INVOKING
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
QUACK
SCIENCE
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
TECHNIQUE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
MASSAGE
THERE
IS
A
TECHNIQUE
CALLED
DEEP
ABDOMINAL
MASSAGE
IN
WHICH
THE
MASSEUR
IS
LITERALLY
ATTEMPTING
TO
MASSAGE
THE
INTESTINES
THE
NOTION
IS
THAT
UNDIGESTED
FOOD
ADHERES
TO
THE
INNER
SURFACE
OF
THE
INTESTINES
AND
PUTRIFIES
RELEASING
POISONS
WHICH
CAUSE
VARIOUS
DISEASE
SYNDROMES
BY
THIS
VIGOROUS
AND
PAINFUL
PROCEDURE
IT
IS
ALLEGED
THAT
THESE
DEPOSITS
CAN
BE
LOOSENED
UP
AND
PASSED
OUT
I
JUST
CANT
BELIEVE
THIS
IDEA
HAS
ANY
TRUTH
BEHIND
IT
THE
HUMAN
INTESTINE
IS
NOT
A
NEW
YORK
CITY
SEWER
PIPE
AND
EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
YOU
EAT
HALF
OF
A
SMALL
BOX
OF
TRISCUITS
AND
THERE
AINT
GONNA
BE
NOTHIN
STICKING
TO
THE
INNER
SURFACE
OF
YOUR
INTESTINE
