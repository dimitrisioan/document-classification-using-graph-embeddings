i
agree
with
everything
that
lee
lady
wrote
in
her
previous
post
in
this
thread
gee
maybe
ive
misjudged
you
russell
anyone
who
agrees
with
something
i
say
cant
be
all
bad
seriously
im
not
sure
whether
i
misjudged
you
or
not
in
one
respect
i
still
have
a
major
problem
though
with
your
insistence
that
science
is
mainly
about
avoiding
mistakes
and
i
still
disagree
with
your
contention
that
nobody
who
doesnt
use
methods
deemed
scientific
can
possibly
know
whats
true
and
whats
not
deleted
material
which
i
agree
with
back
to
lee
lady
these
are
not
the
rules
according
to
many
who
post
to
scimed
and
scipsychology
according
to
these
posters
if
its
not
supported
by
carefully
designed
controlled
studies
then
its
not
science
these
posters
are
making
the
mistake
that
i
have
previously
criticized
of
adhering
to
a
methodological
recipe
a
carefully
rules
such
as
support
the
hypothesis
by
a
carefully
designed
and
controlled
study
are
too
narrow
to
apply
to
all
investigation
i
think
that
the
requirements
for
particular
reasoning
to
be
convincing
depends
greatly
on
the
kinds
of
mistakes
that
have
occurred
in
past
reasoning
about
the
same
kinds
of
things
to
reuse
the
previous
example
we
know
that
conclusions
from
uncontrolled
observations
of
the
treatment
of
chronic
medical
problems
are
notoriously
problematic
okay
so
lets
see
if
we
agree
on
this
first
of
all
there
are
degrees
of
certainty
it
might
be
appropriate
for
instance
to
demand
carefully
controlled
trials
before
we
accept
as
absolute
scientific
truth
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
thing
the
effectiveness
of
a
certain
treatment
on
the
other
hand
highly
favorable
clinical
experience
even
if
uncontrolled
can
be
adequate
to
justify
a
preliminary
judgement
that
a
treatment
is
useful
this
is
often
the
best
evidence
we
can
hope
for
from
investigators
who
do
not
have
institutional
or
corporate
support
in
this
case
it
makes
sense
to
tentatively
treat
claims
as
credible
but
to
reserve
final
judgement
until
establishment
scientists
who
are
qualified
and
have
the
necessary
resources
can
do
more
careful
testing
secondly
it
makes
sense
to
be
more
tolerant
in
our
standards
of
evidence
for
a
pronounced
effect
than
for
one
that
is
marginal
i
come
to
this
dispute
about
what
science
is
not
only
as
a
mathematician
but
as
a
veteran
of
many
arguments
in
scipsychology
and
occasionally
in
scimed
about
nlp
neurolinguistic
programming
much
of
the
work
done
to
date
by
nlpers
can
be
better
categorized
as
informal
exploration
than
as
careful
scientific
research
for
years
now
i
have
been
trying
to
get
scientific
and
clinical
psychologists
to
just
take
a
look
at
it
to
read
a
few
of
the
books
and
watch
some
of
the
videotapes
courtesy
of
your
local
university
library
not
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
definitive
judgement
but
simply
to
look
at
the
nlp
methodology
especially
the
approach
to
eliciting
information
from
subjects
and
look
for
ideas
and
hypotheses
which
might
be
of
scientific
interest
and
most
especially
to
be
aware
of
the
questions
nlp
suggests
which
might
be
worthy
of
scientific
investigation
over
and
over
again
the
response
i
get
in
scipychology
is
if
this
hasnt
been
thoroughly
validated
by
the
accepted
form
of
empirical
research
then
it
cant
be
of
any
interest
to
us
to
me
the
ultimate
reducio
ad
absurdum
of
the
extreme
thereve
got
to
be
controlled
studies
position
is
an
nlp
technique
called
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
simple
phobias
as
opposed
to
agoraphobia
may
not
be
the
worlds
most
important
psychological
disorder
but
the
nice
thing
about
them
is
that
it
doesnt
take
a
sophisticated
instrument
to
diagnose
them
or
tell
when
someone
is
cured
of
one
the
nlp
phobia
cure
is
a
simple
visualization
which
requires
less
than
minutes
nlpers
claim
that
it
can
also
be
used
to
neutralize
a
traumatic
memory
and
hence
is
useful
in
treating
posttraumatic
stress
syndrome
it
is
essentially
a
variation
on
the
classic
desensitization
process
used
by
behavioral
therapists
a
subject
only
needs
to
be
taken
through
the
technique
once
or
in
the
case
of
ptsd
once
for
each
traumatic
incident
the
process
doesnt
need
to
be
repeated
and
the
subject
doesnt
need
to
practice
it
over
again
at
home
now
to
me
it
seems
pretty
easy
to
test
the
effectiveness
of
this
cure
especially
if
as
nlpers
claim
the
success
rate
is
extremely
high
take
someone
with
a
fear
of
heights
as
i
used
to
have
take
them
up
to
a
balcony
on
the
floor
and
observe
their
response
spend
minutes
to
have
them
do
the
simple
visualization
send
them
back
up
to
the
balcony
and
see
if
things
have
changed
check
back
with
them
in
a
few
weeks
to
see
if
the
cure
seems
to
be
lasting
more
long
term
followup
is
certainly
desirable
but
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
even
a
cure
that
lasts
several
weeks
has
significance
in
any
case
there
are
many
known
cases
where
the
cure
has
lasted
years
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
there
is
no
known
case
where
the
cure
has
been
reversed
after
holding
for
a
few
weeks
my
own
cure
incidentally
was
done
with
a
slightly
different
nlp
technique
before
i
learned
of
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
ten
years
later
now
i
enjoy
living
on
the
floor
of
my
building
and
having
a
large
balcony
the
folks
over
in
scipsychology
have
a
hundred
and
one
excuses
not
to
make
this
simple
test
they
claim
that
only
an
elaborate
outcome
study
will
be
satisfactory
a
study
of
the
sort
that
nlp
practitioners
many
of
whom
make
a
barely
marginal
living
from
their
practice
can
ill
afford
to
do
most
of
them
are
also
just
plain
not
interested
because
the
whole
idea
seems
frivolous
and
since
theyre
not
part
of
the
scientific
establishment
they
have
no
tangible
rewards
to
gain
from
scientific
acceptance
the
fast
phobiatrauma
cure
is
over
ten
years
old
now
and
the
clinical
psychology
establishment
is
still
saying
we
dont
have
any
way
of
knowing
that
its
effective
these
academics
themselves
have
the
resources
to
do
a
study
as
elaborate
as
anyone
could
want
of
course
but
they
say
why
should
i
prove
your
theory
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
one
making
the
claim
one
academic
in
scipsychology
said
that
it
would
be
completely
unscientific
for
him
to
test
the
phobia
cure
since
it
hasnt
been
described
in
a
scientific
journal
its
described
in
a
number
of
books
and
ive
posted
articles
in
scipsychology
describing
it
in
as
much
detail
as
im
capable
of
actually
at
least
one
fairly
careful
academic
study
has
been
done
with
favorable
results
but
its
apparently
not
acceptable
because
its
a
doctoral
dissertation
and
not
published
in
a
refereed
journal
to
me
this
sort
of
attitude
does
not
advance
science
but
hinders
it
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
i
have
in
mind
when
i
talk
about
doctrinnaire
attitudes
about
science
now
maybe
i
have
been
unfair
in
imputing
such
attitudes
to
you
russell
if
so
i
apologize
in
the
arguments
between
behaviorists
and
cognitivists
psychology
seems
less
like
a
science
than
a
collection
of
competing
religious
sects
