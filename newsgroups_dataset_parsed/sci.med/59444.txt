WRITES
HELLO
A
FRIEND
IS
UNDER
GOING
KEMOTHERAPYSP
FOR
BREAST
CANCER
IM
TRYING
TO
LEARN
WHAT
I
CAN
ABOUT
IT
ANY
INFO
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
THANKS
YOUVE
ASKED
A
TOUGHIE
OF
A
QUESTION
THERE
ARE
MANY
DIFFERENT
DRUGS
WHICH
ARE
USED
FOR
CHEMOTHERAPY
THE
OVERALL
PURPOSE
OF
CHEMOTHERAPY
DONT
WORRY
ABOUT
THE
SPELLING
SOME
OF
THESE
CRAZY
MEDICAL
WORDS
ARE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
SPELL
IS
TO
EITHER
DESTROY
CANCER
CELLS
OR
TO
KEEP
THEM
FROM
GROWING
DIFFERENT
DRUGS
HAVE
DIFFERENT
EFFECTS
ON
CANCER
CELLS
AND
THEREFORE
IT
IS
NOT
UNCOMMON
TO
USE
MORE
THAN
ONE
DRUG
AT
A
TIME
SOME
CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC
DRUGS
ARE
EFFECTIVE
ANYTIME
DURING
THE
GROWTH
CYCLE
OF
A
CELL
OTHERS
WORK
ONLY
AT
SPECIFIC
TIMES
DURING
THE
CELL
CYCLE
THE
FIRST
PHASE
OF
THE
CELL
CYCLE
IS
IT
IS
WHEN
THE
PROTEIN
SYNTHESIS
AND
RNA
SYSTHESIS
OCCURS
IN
THE
SECOND
PHASE
S
SYNTHESIS
OF
DNA
OCCURS
THE
THIRD
PHASE
IS
THE
DNA
SPLITS
AND
RNA
AND
PROTEIN
ARE
SYNTHESIZED
AAGAIN
IN
THE
FOURTH
PHASE
M
OR
MITOSIS
THE
CELL
MAY
DIVIDE
THERE
ARE
DRUGS
WHICH
ARE
EFFECTIVE
IN
EACH
PHASE
SOME
STOP
DNA
SYNTHESIS
OTHERS
STOP
THE
CELL
FROM
DIVIDING
OTHERS
WRECK
PROTEIN
SYNTHESIS
AT
ANY
RATE
THE
END
RESULT
THAT
IS
BEING
SOUGHT
IS
FOR
THE
CANCER
CELLS
TO
STOP
GROWING
IF
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SEEKING
IS
PRACTICAL
ADVICE
I
APOLOGIZE
FOR
RAMBLING
ON
THE
TECHNO
STUFF
SOME
SIDE
EFFECTS
ARE
PRETTY
COMMON
CHEMO
DRUGS
ARE
RATHER
NASTY
IT
CAN
CAUSE
A
PERSON
TO
LOSE
THEIR
APPETITE
AND
TO
EXPERIENCE
NAUSEA
AND
VOMITING
THINGS
TO
HELP
THIS
INCLUDE
EATING
SMALL
FREQUENT
MEALS
IT
IS
ALSO
SUGGESTED
THAT
IF
NAUSEAVOMITING
HEREAFTER
KNOWN
AS
NV
OCCURS
THAT
THE
PERSON
NOTIFY
THE
DOCTOR
THERE
ARE
MEDICINES
TTHAT
HELP
NAUSEA
DIARRHEA
CAN
BE
AN
EFFECT
ANTIDIARRHEAL
MEDICATIONS
CAN
BE
GIVEN
AND
GOOD
SKINCARE
AND
FLUID
INTAKE
ARE
IMPORTANT
PROBABLY
THE
ONE
OF
BIGGEST
CONCSERN
IS
HAIR
LOSS
THIS
DOES
NOT
ALWAYS
HAPPEN
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
DRUGS
ARE
BEING
GIVEN
AND
ON
THE
PERSON
THEMSELF
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
TAKING
THE
SAME
DRUG
CAN
AND
DO
HAVE
DIFFERENT
SIDE
EFFECTS
I
HAVE
SEEN
SOME
LITERATURE
WHICH
STATES
THAT
WEARING
A
SNUG
HEADBAND
ANDOR
WEARING
AN
ICE
CAP
CAN
HELP
REDUCE
HAIR
LOSS
PRESUMABLY
BY
REDUCING
BLOOD
FLOW
TO
THE
SCALP
IF
ANYONE
HAS
SEEN
RESEARCH
ON
THIS
TOO
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
SEE
IT
AND
POSSIBLY
SOME
BIB
DATA
I
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
MAKING
CONTACT
WITH
THE
AMERICAN
CANCER
SOCIETY
THEY
HAVE
A
VAST
SELECTION
OF
LITERATURE
AND
INFORMATION
IN
ADDITION
IF
YOUR
FRIEND
HAS
HAD
A
MASTECTOMY
I
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
REACH
FOR
RECOVERY
IT
IS
A
SUPPORT
GROUP
COMPRISED
ENTIRELY
OF
WOMEN
WHO
HAVE
LOST
A
BREAST
BECAUSE
OF
CANCER
THEY
CAN
OFFER
SOME
EXCELLENT
SUPPORT
AND
SUGGESTIONS
IF
YOU
HAVE
FURTHER
QUESTIONS
PLEASE
SEND
ME
EMAIL
I
HAV
SOME
GOOD
ACCESS
TO
INFORMATION
AND
I
ENJOY
TRYING
TO
HELP
OTHER
PEOPLE
I
WISH
THE
BEST
TO
YOU
AND
YOUR
FRIEND
