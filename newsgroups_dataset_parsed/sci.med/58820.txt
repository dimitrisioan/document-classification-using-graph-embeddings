IN
MY
LOW
BACK
AND
RIGHT
LEG
MY
OSTEOPATH
SENT
ME
TO
GET
AN
MRI
WHICH
REVEALED
A
PROTRUDING
AND
EXTRUDED
DISC
AT
I
WENT
TO
A
NEUROSURGEON
WHO
PRESCRIBED
PREDNISOLE
A
STEROIDAL
ANTIINFLAMITORY
AND
BED
REST
FOR
SEVERAL
DAYS
ITS
BEEN
NEARLY
A
WEEK
AND
OVERALL
I
FEEL
SLIGHTLY
WORSE

MY
NONSURGICAL
OPTIONS
IF
MY
GOAL
IS
TO
RESUME
FULL
ACTIVITY
INCLUDING
COMPETITIVE
CYCLING
I
SHOULD
ADD
THIS
CONDITION
IS
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
RESULT
OF
COMMULATIVE
WEAR
AND
TEAR
IVE
HAD
CHRONIC
LOWBACK
PAIN
FOR
YEARS
BUT
I
MANAGED
YOU
DONT
SAY
WHETHER
OR
NOT
YOU
HAVE
ANY
SYMPTOMS
OTHER
THAN
PAIN
IF
YOU
HAVE
NUMBNESS
WEAKNESS
OR
BLADDER
PROBLEMS
FOR
EXAMPLE
THESE
WOULD
SUGGEST
A
NEED
FOR
SURGERY
IF
PAIN
IS
YOUR
ONLY
SYMPTOM
YOU
MIGHT
DO
WELL
TO
FIND
A
REPUTABLE
MULTIDISCIPLINARY
PAIN
CLINIC
IN
YOUR
AREA
CHRONIC
LOW
BACK
PAIN
GENERALLY
DOESNT
DO
WELL
WITH
SURGERY
ACUTE
ON
CHRONIC
PAIN
AS
ONLY
SYMPTOM
DOESNT
FARE
MUCH
BETTER
E
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
MRI
FINDINGS
AND
SYMPTOMS
IS
CONTROVERSIAL
