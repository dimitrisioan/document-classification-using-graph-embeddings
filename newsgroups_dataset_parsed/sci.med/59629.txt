HOW
OFTEN
DO
KIDS
FALL
SICK
ETC
OUR
SON
HAS
STARTED
FALLING
SICK
QUITE
OFTEN
EVERY
SINCE
HE
STARTED
GOING
TO
DAY
CARE
HE
WAS
AT
HOME
FOR
THE
FIRST
YEAR
AND
HE
DID
NOT
FALL
SICK
EVEN
ONCE
NOW
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
HE
HAS
SOME
SORT
OF
COLD
OR
FLU
PRETTY
MUCH
ONCE
A
MONTH
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THE
COLD
LEADS
TO
AN
EAR
INFECTION
AS
WELL
WITH
THE
RESULT
THAT
HE
ENDS
UP
BEING
ON
ANTIBIOTICS
WEEKS
OUT
OF
I
KNOW
KIDS
IN
DAY
CARE
FALL
SICK
MORE
OFTEN
BUT
WE
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
WONDER
HOW
OFTEN
MORE
OFTEN
REALLY
IS
WHETHER
OUR
SON
IS
MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE
OR
HAS
LOWER
IMMUNITY
THAN
AVERAGE
WHAT
THE
LONGERTERM
EFFECTS
OF
CONSTANTLY
BEING
SICK
AND
TAKING
ANTIBIOTICS
ARE
AND
WHAT
WE
CAN
DO
TO
BUILD
UP
HIS
RESISTANCE
HE
REALLY
ENJOYS
HIS
DAY
CARE
AND
WE
THINK
ITS
GREAT
TOO
BUT
WE
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
WONDER
WHETHER
WE
SHOULD
THINK
ABOUT
GETTING
A
NANNY
ARE
THERE
ANY
STUDIES
THAT
CAN
HELP
ANSWER
SOME
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
HOW
OFTEN
DO
KIDS
IN
THEIR
FIRST
SECOND
AND
THIRD
YEARS
FALL
SICK
HOW
OFTEN
DO
THEY
GET
COLDS
FLUS
EAR
INFECTIONS
IS
THERE
ANY
DATA
ON
HOME
CARE
VS
DAY
CARE
DOES
BEING
SICK
BUILD
IMMUNITY
LEADING
TO
LESS
ILLNESS
LATER
DOES
IT
MAKE
KIDS
WEAKER
LEADING
TO
MORE
ILLNESS
LATER
OR
DOES
IT
NOT
HAVE
ANY
LONG
TERM
EFFECT
DOES
TAKING
ANTIBIOTICS
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
HAVE
ANY
NEGATIVE
LONG
TERM
EFFECTS
HOW
DOES
ONE
TELL
IF
A
CHILD
IS
MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ILLNESS
THAN
NORMAL
AND
WHAT
DOES
ONE
DO
ABOUT
IT
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
TO
BUILD
IMMUNITY
AND
RESISTANCE
ANY
DATA
INFORMATION
OR
ADVICE
RELATING
TO
THIS
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
THANKS
A
LOT
