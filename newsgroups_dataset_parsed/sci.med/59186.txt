THE
BEST
WAY
OF
SELF
INJECTION
IS
TO
USE
THE
RIGHT
SIZE
NEEDLE
AND
CHOOSE
THE
CORRECT
SPOT
FOR
STREPTOMYCIN
USUALLY
GIVEN
INTRA
MUSCULARLY
USE
A
THIN
NEEDLE
GUAGE
AND
SELECT
A
SPOT
ON
THE
UPPER
OUTER
THIGH
NO
MAJOR
NERVES
OR
BLOOD
VESSELS
THERE
CLEAN
THE
AREA
WITH
ANTISEPTIC
BEFORE
INJECTION
AND
AFTER
MAKE
SURE
TO
INJECT
DEEPLY
A
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
PAIN
IS
FELT
WHEN
THE
NEEDLE
ENTERS
THE
MUSCLE
CONTRASTED
TO
THE
PRICK
WHEN
IT
PIERCES
THE
SKIN
PS
TRY
TO
GO
TO
A
DOCTOR
SELFTREATMENT
AND
SELFINJECTION
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
AS
FAR
AS
POSSIBLE
THE
AREAS
THAT
ARE
LEAST
LIKELY
TO
HURT
ARE
WHERE
YOU
HAVE
A
LITTLE
FAT
I
INJECT
ON
MY
LEGS
AND
GUT
AND
PREFER
THE
GUT
I
CAN
STICK
IT
IN
AT
A
DEGREE
ANGLE
AND
BARELY
FEEL
IT
IM
NOT
FAT
JUST
HAVE
A
LITTLE
GUT
MY
LEGS
HOWEVER
ARE
MUSCULAR
AND
I
HAVE
TO
PINCH
TO
GET
ANYTHING
AND
THEN
I
INJECT
AT
ABOUT
A
DEGREE
ANGLEAND
IT
STILL
HURTS
THE
RATE
OF
ABSORBTION
DIFFERS
FOR
SUBCUTANEOUS
AND
MUSCULAR
INJECTIONS
HOWEVERSO
IF
ITS
A
DAILY
THING
IT
WOULD
BE
BEST
NOT
TO
SWITCH
PLACES
EVERY
DAY
TO
KEEP
CONSISTENCEY
ALTHOUGH
SOME
SUGGEST
SWITCH
LEGS
OR
SIDES
OF
THE
STOMACH
FOR
EACH
SHOT
TO
PREVENT
IRRITATION
WHEN
YOU
CLEAN
THE
SPOT
OFF
WITH
AN
ALCOHOL
PREP
WAIT
FOR
IT
TO
DRY
SOMEWHAT
OR
YOU
MAY
GET
THE
ALCOHOL
IN
THE
PUNCTURE
AND
OF
COURSE
THAT
DOESNT
FEEL
GOOD
A
WAY
TO
PREVENT
IRRATATION
IS
TO
MARK
THE
SPOT
THAT
YOU
INJECTED
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
DO
THIS
IS
USE
A
LITTLE
ROUND
BANDAGE
AND
PUT
IT
OVER
THE
SPOT
THIS
HELPS
PREVENT
YOU
FROM
INJECTING
IN
THE
SAME
SPOT
AND
SPACING
THE
SITES
OUT
ACCUARTELY
ABOUT
APART
THIS
IS
FROM
EXPERIENCE
SO
I
HOPE
ITLL
HELP
YOU
I
HAVE
DIABETES
AND
HAVE
TO
TAKE
AN
INJECTION
EVERY
MORNING
LATER
