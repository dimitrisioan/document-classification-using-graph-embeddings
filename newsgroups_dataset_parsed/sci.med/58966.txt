RE
PLACEBO
EFFECTS
IN
ARTICLE
DANIEL
PRINCE
WRITES
IS
THERE
AN
EFFECT
WHERE
THE
DOCTOR
BELIEVES
SO
STRONGLY
IN
A
MEDICINE
THAT
HESHE
SEES
IMPROVEMENT
WHERE
THE
IS
NONE
OR
SEES
MORE
IMPROVEMENT
THAN
THERE
IS
IF
SO
WHAT
IS
THIS
EFFECT
CALLED
IS
THERE
A
REVERSE
OF
THE
ABOVE
EFFECT
WHERE
THE
DOCTOR
DOESNT
BELIEVE
IN
A
MEDICINE
AND
THEN
SEES
LESS
IMPROVEMENT
THAN
THERE
IS
WHAT
WOULD
THIS
EFFECT
BE
CALLED
HAVE
THESE
EFFECTS
EVER
BEEN
STUDIED
HOW
COMMON
ARE
THESE
EFFECTS
THANK
YOU
IN
ADVANCE
FOR
ALL
REPLIES
THESE
EFFECTS
ARE
A
VERY
REAL
CONCERN
IN
CONDUCTING
STUDIES
OF
NEW
TREATMENTS
RESEARCHERS
TRY
TO
LIMIT
THIS
KIND
OF
EFFECT
BY
PERFORMING
STUDIES
THAT
ARE
BLIND
IN
VARIOUS
WAYS
SOME
OF
THESE
ARE
O
THE
SUBJECTS
OF
THE
STUDY
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHETHER
THEY
RECEIVE
A
PLACEBO
OR
THE
TEST
TREATMENT
IE
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
IN
THE
CONTROL
GROUP
OR
THE
TEST
GROUP
O
THOSE
ADMINISTERING
THE
TREATMENT
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHICH
SUBJECTS
RECEIVE
A
PLACEBO
OR
THE
TEST
TREATMENT
O
THOSE
EVALUATING
INDIVIDUAL
RESULTS
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHICH
SUBJECTS
RECEIVE
A
PLACEBO
OR
THE
TEST
TREATMENT
OBVIOUSLY
AT
THE
POINT
AT
WHICH
THE
DATA
IS
ANALYZED
ONE
HAS
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
THE
TEST
GROUP
FROM
THE
CONTROL
GROUP
BUT
THE
ANALYSIS
IS
QUASIPUBLIC
THE
RESEARCHER
DESCRIBES
IT
AND
PRESENTS
THE
DATA
ON
WHICH
IT
IS
BASED
SO
THAT
OTHERS
CAN
VERIFY
IT
IT
IS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
IN
BIOLOGICAL
STUDIES
WHERE
THE
SUBJECTS
ARE
ANIMALS
SUCH
AS
MICE
THERE
WERE
MANY
CASES
OF
SKEWED
RESULTS
BECAUSE
THOSE
WHO
PERFORMED
THE
STUDY
DID
NOT
BLIND
THEMSELVES
IT
IS
NOT
CONSIDERED
SO
IMPORTANT
TO
MAKE
MICE
MORE
IGNORANT
THAN
THEY
ALREADY
ARE
THOUGH
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
THAT
IN
ALL
RESPECTS
EXCEPT
THE
ONE
TESTED
THE
CONTROL
AND
TEST
GROUPS
ARE
TREATED
ALIKE
