RE
KIDNEY
STONES
A
STUDENT
TOLD
ME
TODAY
THAT
SHE
HAS
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
WITH
KIDNEY
STONES
A
CYST
ON
ONE
KIDNEY
AND
A
KIDNEY
INFECTION
SHE
WAS
UPSET
BECAUSE
HER
CONDITION
HAD
BEEN
MISDIAGNOSED
SINCE
LAST
FALL
AND
SHE
HAS
BEEN
ILL
ALL
THIS
TIME
DURING
HER
MOST
RECENT
DOCTORS
APPOINTMENT
AT
HER
PARENTS
HMO
CLINIC
SHE
SAID
THAT
ABOUT
FORTY
XRAYS
WERE
MADE
OF
HER
KIDNEY
WHEN
SHE
ASKED
WHY
SO
MANY
XRAYS
WERE
BEING
MADE
SHE
WAS
TOLD
BY
A
TECHNICIAN
THAT
THEY
NEED
TO
SEE
THE
AREA
FROM
DIFFERENT
VIEWS
BUT
SHE
SAYS
THAT
ABOUT
FIVE
XRAYS
WERE
MADE
FROM
EACH
ANGLE
SHE
COULDNT
HELP
FEELING
THAT
SOMETHING
MUST
BE
WRONG
WITH
THE
PROCEDURE
OR
SOMETHING
SHE
IS
A
PREMED
STUDENT
AND
FEELS
SHE
COULD
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
IF
SOMEONE
WOULD
HAVE
EXPLAINED
WHEN
NOBODY
WOULD
SHE
GOT
WORRIED
ALSO
SHE
IS
TOLD
THAT
THRE
ARE
SURGERY
PATIENTS
AHEAD
OF
HER
AND
THAT
THEY
CANNOT
DO
SURGERY
UNTIL
AUGUST
OR
SO
IT
IS
NOW
APRIL
SHE
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
REST
A
LOT
AND
DRINK
FLUIDS
BUT
SHE
HAS
TO
GO
TO
CLASSES
SHE
WONDERS
WHY
THEY
HAVE
GIVEN
HER
NO
MEDICINE
SHE
PLANS
TO
CALL
BACK
HER
DOCTORS
OFFICE
CLINIC
AND
TRY
TO
GET
ANSWERS
TO
THESE
QUESTIONS
BUT
I
TOLD
HER
I
WOULD
ALSO
WRITE
IN
TO
SCIMED
AND
SEE
WHAT
I
COULD
FIND
OUT
ABOUT
WHY
THERE
WERE
SO
MANY
XRAYS
AND
WHETHER
IT
SEEMS
OK
TO
WAIT
IN
LINE
OR
MORE
MONTHS
FOR
SURGERY
FOR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
OR
WHETHER
SHE
SHOULD
BE
LOOKING
ELSEWHERE
FOR
HER
CARE
SHE
DOES
PLAN
TO
GET
A
SECOND
OPINION
TOO
I
WILL
PASS
INFO
ON
TO
HER
IT
NEVER
HURTS
TO
GET
INFORMATION
FROM
MORE
THAN
ONE
SOURCE
YOU
CAN
EMAIL
ME
OR
POST
THANKS
ALICE
