INSENSITIVE
TECHNICIANS
A
FRIEND
WAS
RECENTLY
ADMITTED
TO
NORTH
CAROLINA
MEMORIAL
HOSPITAL
BECAUSE
OF
SUSPECTED
MENINGITIS
SERIOUS
BUSINESS
THEY
WANTED
TO
DO
A
LUMBAR
PUNCTURE
FOR
WHICH
A
CT
SCAN
IS
A
PREREQUISITE
I
ARRIVED
IN
HER
HOSPITAL
ROOM
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
AFTER
SHE
HAD
RETURNED
FROM
THE
CT
SHE
WAS
IN
TEARS
EVIDENTLY
THE
TECHNICIANS
IN
THE
CT
LAB
HAD
BEEN
VERY
UNPLEASANT
TO
HER
TO
BEGIN
WITH
THEY
PUT
HER
ON
THE
APPARATUS
THAT
MOVES
YOU
INTO
THE
MACHINE
ITSELF
AND
JUST
PUSHED
A
BUTTON
TO
SLIDE
HER
STRAIGHT
INTO
THE
MACHINE
WITHOUT
ANY
EXPLANATION
IMAGINE
THIS
YOU
WORRIED
YOU
MAY
HAVE
A
DEADLY
DISEASE
AND
NEXT
THING
YOU
KNOW
YOURE
BEING
PUT
INTO
THIS
BIG
SCARY
MACHINE
WITHOUT
A
WORD
OF
EXPLANATION
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
TO
YOU
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
INEXCUSABLE
SHE
WAVED
HER
HAND
AS
IF
TO
SAY
WHAT
ARE
YOU
DOING
TO
ME
AND
THEY
RESPONDED
WITH
ANNOYANCE
AND
ANGER
NEXT
THEY
INSERTED
OR
TRIED
TO
INSERT
AN
IV
CATHETER
APPARENTLY
SHE
HAS
A
LOT
OF
TROUBLE
WITH
THESE
AND
COMPLAINED
OF
THE
PAIN
THE
TECHNICIAN
JUST
STOPPED
AND
FIXED
HER
WITH
A
GLARE
WITHOUT
ANY
WORDS
OF
EXPLANATION
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
I
CAN
DO
ABOUT
THESE
PIGS
I
REALIZE
THAT
THESE
TECHNICIANS
DO
THIS
SORT
OF
JOB
DAY
IN
AND
DAY
OUT
AND
THAT
SOME
PATIENTS
CAN
BE
VERY
IRRITATING
AND
UNCOOPERATIVE
BUT
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
NO
EXCUSE
THEIR
PURPOSE
FOR
EXISTING
IS
TO
HELP
SICK
PEOPLE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
EXCUSE
FOR
THIS
SORT
OF
BEHAVIOR
FORTUNATELY
MY
FRIEND
IS
FINE
BUT
I
IMAGINE
A
LARGE
PROPORTION
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
GET
CT
SCANS
ARE
NOT
FINE
AT
ALL
THEY
HAVE
CANCER
AND
THAT
SORT
OF
THING
THEY
DONT
NEED
THIS
KIND
OF
SHIT
ALSO
SINCE
I
NAMED
THE
HOSPITAL
INVOLVED
I
SHOULD
ALSO
POINT
OUT
THAT
NEITHER
SHE
NOR
I
HAVE
ANY
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
THE
COMPETENCE
OR
COMPASSION
OF
ANY
OF
THE
OTHER
PERSONNEL
AT
NCMH
THANKS
FOR
LISTENING
