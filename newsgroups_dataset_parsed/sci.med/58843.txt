WRITES
I
HAD
A
SIMILAR
REACTION
TO
CHINESE
FOOD
BUT
CAME
TO
A
COMPLETLY
DIFFERENT
CONCLUSION
IVE
EATEN
CHINESE
FOOD
FOR
AGES
AND
NEVER
HAD
PROBLEMS
I
WENT
WITH
SOME
CHINESE
MALAYSIAN
FRIENDS
TO
A
SWANKY
CHINSES
REST
AND
THEY
ORDERED
LOTS
OF
STUFF
I
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
BEFORE
THE
ONLY
THING
I
CAN
REMEMBER
OF
THAT
MEAL
WAS
THE
FIRST
COURSE
SCALLOPS
SERVED
IN
THE
SHELL
WITH
A
SOYTYPE
SAUCE
I
THOUGHT
WELL
IVE
ONLY
HAD
SCALLOPS
ONCE
AND
I
WAS
SICK
AFTER
BUT
THAT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
COINCIDENCE
THAT
NIGHT
AS
I
SAT
ON
THE
BATHROOM
FLOOR
SWEATING
AND
EMPTYING
MY
STOMACH
THE
HARD
WAY
I
DECIDED
I
WOULD
NEVER
TOUCH
ANOTHER
SCALLOP
I
MAY
NOT
BE
ALLERGIC
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
TAKE
THE
CHANCE
I
DONT
REACT
TO
SCALLOPS
BUT
DID
HAVE
DISCOMFORTS
WITH
CLAM
JUICE
SERVED
AT
AMERICAN
WATERFRONT
SEAFOOD
BARS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
THE
JUICE
IS
HOMEMADE
OR
FROM
CANS
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
MY
FIRST
ENCOUNTER
WITH
THE
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
SYNDROME
TEN
YEARS
AGO
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
AFTER
HAVING
WON
TON
SOUP
I
COLLAPSED
IN
A
CHAIR
WITH
MY
FACE
FEELING
PUFFED
UP
MY
SCALP
TINGLING
MY
FEET
TOO
WEAK
TO
STAND
UP
THE
SYMPTOMS
LASTED
FOR
ABOUT
MINUTES
DETERMINED
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
CAUSE
OF
MY
FIRST
REACTION
I
WENT
BACK
TO
THE
CHINESE
RESTUARANT
AND
ORDERED
THE
SAME
DISH
THE
SAME
THING
HAPPENED
A
QUICK
LOOK
INSIDE
THE
KITCHEN
REVEALED
NOTHING
OUT
OF
THE
ORDINARY
IVE
ALSO
HAD
A
MILD
ATTACK
AFTER
HAVING
SOUP
AT
A
THAI
RESTUARANT
