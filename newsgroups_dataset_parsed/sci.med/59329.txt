AND
WATER
BIOAVAILABILITY
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
EITHER
THEOPHYLLINE
OR
EPHEDRINE
OR
THE
TWO
IN
COMBINATION
CAN
REDUCE
THE
BODYS
ABILITY
TO
MAKE
USE
OF
AVAILABLE
WATER
I
HAD
KIND
OF
AN
ODD
EXPERIENCE
ON
A
GROUP
HIKE
RECENTLY
BECOMING
DEHYRATED
AFTER
ABOUT
HOURS
OF
RIGOROUS
HIKING
DESPITE
HAVING
BROUGHT
GALLONS
OF
WATER
C
LITERS
I
DRANK
CLOSE
TO
TWICE
AS
MUCH
AS
ANYONE
ELSE
AND
NO
ONE
ELSE
WAS
DEHYDRATED
I
DONT
THINK
GENERAL
PHYSICAL
CONDITION
WAS
AN
ISSUE
SINCE
I
WAS
IN
AT
LEAST
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
PACK
IN
TERMS
OF
GENERAL
STAMINA
SO
FAR
AS
I
COULD
TELL
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
I
JUST
PLAIN
NEED
MORE
WATER
THAN
MOST
PEOPLE
BUT
I
AM
WONDERING
IF
THEOPHYLLINE
ANDOR
EPHEDRINE
MIGHT
BE
AGGRAVATING
THINGS
I
TOOK
A
COUPLE
OF
PRIMATENE
TABLETS
DURING
THE
HIKE
TO
CONTROL
ASTHMA
MG
EPHEDRINE
MG
THEOPHYLLINE
I
GATHER
THAT
BOTH
THOSE
DRUGS
ARE
DIURETICS
SO
NOW
IM
WONDERING
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THEY
CAN
REDUCE
THE
BODYS
ABILITY
TO
UTILIZE
AVAILABLE
WATER
WOULD
IT
BE
A
PARTICULARLY
STUPID
THING
TO
TAKE
THAT
MEDICATION
DURING
HOTWEATHER
EXERCISE
I
ALWAYS
ASSUMED
DIURESIS
JUST
MEANT
YOU
URINATED
A
LOT
BUT
THAT
WASNT
THE
CASE
YESTERDAY
