ARTHRITIS
INFO
NEEDED
PLEASE
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
HAS
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
WITH
PSORIATIC
ARTHRITIS
AS
A
RESULT
OF
TRAUMA
SUSTAINED
IN
A
CAR
ACCIDENT
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
THE
PSORIASIS
IS
UNDER
CONTROL
BUT
THE
ARTHRITIS
PART
OF
THE
ILLNESS
IS
NOT
ANSAID
NONSTEROIDAL
ANTIINFLAMMATORY
WORKED
PRETTY
WELL
FOR
THREE
YEARS
BUT
ISNT
HELPING
MUCH
NOW
MY
FRIEND
IS
NOW
TAKING
MECLOMEN
ANOTHER
NSAID
BUT
THIS
ISNT
HELPING
CONTROL
THE
PAIN
AT
ALL
IN
THE
PAST
TWO
MONTHS
MY
FRIEND
HAS
ALSO
STARTED
TAKING
AZULFADINE
ALONG
WITH
THE
NSAID
MEDICINES
BUT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
THE
COMBINED
DRUGS
ARENT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
REALIZED
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
PAIN
MY
FRIEND
IS
HAVING
PROBLEMS
SLEEPING
STAYING
IN
ONE
POSITION
TOO
LONG
IS
AN
ORDEAL
ANOTHER
MAJOR
CONTRIBUTOR
TO
PAIN
IS
THAT
TENDONITIS

NOW
DEVELOPED
LEFT
THUMB
AND
HAND
WITH
NUMBNESS
AT
THE
BASE
OF
THE
PALM
BOTTOM
OF
FEET
SHOULDERS
AND
OUTER
THIGHS
THE
TENDONITIS
IS
QUITE
PAINFUL
YET
MY
FRIENDS
DOCTOR
HAS
NOT
RECOMMENDED
ANY
FORM
OF
TREATMENT
TO
RELIEVE
IT
THE
LATEST
TWIST
IS
THAT
THE
DOCTOR
HAS
DROPPED
THE
ANTIINFLAMMATORIES
AND
IS
NOW
RECOMMENDING
PREDNISONE
THE
HOPE
IS
THAT
THE
PREDNISONE

TENDONITIS
MY
