WRITES
WHAT
ABOUT
KEKULES
INFAMOUS
DERIVATION
OF
THE
IDEA
OF
BENZENE
RINGS
FROM
A
DAYDREAM
OF
SNAKES
IN
THE
FIRE
BITING
THEIR
TAILS
IS
THIS
SPECIFIC
ENOUGH
TO
COUNT
CERTAINLY
IT
TURNS
UP
REPEATEDLY
IN
BASIC
PHIL
OF
SCI
TEXTS
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
INVENTIVE
COMPONENT
OF
HYPOTHESIZING
I
THINK
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
IS
EXTRASCIENTIFIC
ABOUT
THIS
IT
HAS
BEEN
A
LONG
TIME
SINCE
ANYONE
HAS
PROPOSED
RESTRICTIONS
ON
WHERE
ONE
COMES
UP
WITH
IDEAS
IN
ORDER
FOR
THEM
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
LEGITIMATE
HYPOTHESES
THE
POINT
IN
SHORT
IS
THIS
HYPOTHESES
AND
SPECULATION
IN
SCIENCE
MAY
COME
FROM
WILD
FLIGHTS
OF
FANCY
DAYDREAMS
ANCIENT
TRADITIONS
MODERN
QUACKERY

ANYWHERE
