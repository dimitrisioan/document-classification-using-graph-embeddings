RHINITIS
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
I
RECENTLY
ATTENDED
AN
ALLERY
SEMINAR
STEROID
NASAL
SPRAYS
WERE
DISCUSSED
AFTERWARD
ON
A
ONEONONE

THE
VANCANESE
BECONASE
NASALIDE
NASALCORT
OR
NASALCHROM
WORK
NOR
DO
ANY
ORAL

WORK
SHE
REPLIED
THAT
SHE
SAW
AN
ARTICLE
ON
VASOMOTOR
RHINITIS
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
ALLERGIC
REACTION
AND
THAT
NOTHING
OTHER
THAN
THE
AFRINS
AND
SUCH
WOULD
WORK
WHICH
IN
MY
CASE
IS
TRUE
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
RECENT
RESEARCH
ON
VASOMOTOR
RHINITIS
THAT
SHOWS
THAT
IPRATROPRIUM
BROMIDE
ATROVENT
INHALED
NASALLY
IS
AN
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT
FOR
MANY
SUFFERERS
IT
HAS
BEEN
APPROVED
FOR
THIS
USE
AND
IS
AVAILABLE
WITH
A
NASAL
ADAPTOR
IN
CANADA
IN
THE
US
THE
FDA
HAS
YET
TO
APPROVE
THIS
USE
OF
THE
DRUG
BUT
IT
IS
AVAILABLE
AS
AN
ORAL
INHALER
FOR
COPD
AND
THESE
CAN
BE
ADAPTED
FOR
INTRANASAL
USE
