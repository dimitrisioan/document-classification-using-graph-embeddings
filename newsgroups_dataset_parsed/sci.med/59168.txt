WROTE
A
FRIEND
HAS
WHAT
IS
APPARENTLY
A
FAIRLY
MINOR
CASE
OF
CROHNS
DISEASE
BUT
SHE
CANT
SEEM
TO
EAT
CERTAIN
FOODS
SUCH
AS
FRESH
VEGETABLES
WITHOUT
DISCOMFORT
AND
OF
COURSE
SHE
WANTS
TO
AVOID
A
RECURRENCE
HER
QUESTION
IS
ARE
THERE
ANY
NUTRITIONISTS
WHO
SPECIALIZE
IN
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
CROHNS
DISEASE
IF
SHE
IS
HAVING
PROBLEMS
WITH
FRESH
VEGETABLES
THE
GUESS
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
OBSTRUCTION
OF
THE
INTESTINE
WITHOUT
KNOWING
MORE
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
SAY
WHETHER
THE
OBSTRUCTION
IS
PERMANENT
DUE
TO
SCARRING
OR
TEMPORARY
DUE
TO
SWELLING
OF
INFLAMMED
INTESTINE
IN
GENERAL
THERE
ARE
NO
DIETARY
LIMITATIONS
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
CROHNS
EXCEPT
AS
THEY
RELATE
TO
OBSTRUCTION
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
ANY
FOODS
WILL
BRING
ON
RECURRENCE
OF
CROHNS
INTERESTING
STATEMENTS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
OTHERWISE
IM
CERTAINLY
NOT
QUESTIONING
STEVES
CLAIMS
AS
FOR
ONE
I
AM
NOT
A
DOCTOR
AND
I
AGREE
THAT
FOODS
DONT
BRING
ON
THE
RECURRENCE
OF
CROHNS
BUT
INFLAMMATION
CAN
BE
EITHER
MILDLY
OR
DRASTICALLY
ENHANCED
DUE
TO
FOOD
HAVING
HAD
ONE
MAJOR
OBSTRUCTION
RESULTING
IN
RESECTION
IS
THAT
A
GOOD
ENOUGH
CAVEAT
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
A
LOW
RESIDUE
DIET
IS
CALLED
FOR
BASICALLY
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
IF
THERE
IS
INFLAMMATION
OF
THE
GUT
WHICH
MAY
NOT
BE
REALIZED
BY
THE
PATIENT
ANY
RESIDUE
IN
THE
SYSTEM
CAN
BE
CAUGHT
IN
THE
FOLDS
OF
INFLAMMATION
AND
CONSTANTLY
IRRITATE
THUS
EXACERBATING
THE
PROBLEM
THEREFORE
ANYTHING
THAT
DOESNT
DIGEST
COMPLETELY
BY
THE
POINT
OF
COMMON
INFLAMMATION
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
WITH
WHAT
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
IS
TYPICAL
CROHNS
OF
THE
TERMINAL
ILEUM
MY
DIET
SHOULD
BE
LOW
RESIDUE
CONSISTING
OF
COMPLETELY
OUT
NEVER
AGAIN
ITEMS
O
CORN
KERNEL
HUSK
DOESNT
DIGEST
MOST
OF
US
KNOW
THIS
O
POPCORN
SAME
O
DRIED
DEHYDRATED
FRUIT
AND
FRUIT
SKINS
O
NUTS
VERY
TOUGH
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
GIVING
UP
SOME
FUDGE
DISCOURAGED
GREATLY
O
RAW
VEGETABLES
TOO
FIBROUS
O
WHEAT
AND
RAW
GRAIN
BREADS
O
EXOTIC
LETTUCE
ICEBERG
IS
OK
SINCE
ITS
APPARENTLY
MOSTLY
WATER
O
GREENS
TURNIP
MUSTARD
KALE
ETC
O
LITTLE
SEEDS
LIKE
SESAME
TRY
GETTING
AN
ARBYS
WITHOUT
IT
O
LONG
GRAIN
AND
WILD
RICE
HUSKY
O
BEANS
YOULL
GENERATE
ENOUGH
GAS
ALONE
WITHOUT
THEM
O
BASICALLY
ANYTHING
THAT
REQUIRES
HEAVY
DIGESTIVE
PROCESSING
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THE
MORE
PROCESSED
THE
FOOD
THE
BETTER
RATHER
IRONIC
IN
THIS
DAY
AND
AGE
THE
WHOLE
POINT
IS
PREVENTATIVE
YOU
WANT
TO
GIVE
YOUR
SYSTEM
AS
LITTLE
CHANCE
TO
INFLAME
AS
POSSIBLE
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
AMONG
THE
NUMEROUS
THINGS
THAT
WERE
HEAVILY
DISCOURAGED
I
ONLY
LISTED
A
FEW
TO
TRY
THE
ONES
I
WANTED
AND
SEE
HOW
I
FELT
IF
ITS
BAD
DONT
DO
IT
AGAIN
REMEMBER
THOUGH
THAT
THIS
WAS
WHILE
I
WAS
IN
REMISSION
FOR
VEGGIES
COOK
THE
DAYLIGHTS
OUT
OF
THEM
I
PREFER
STEAMING
I
THINK
ITS
COOKS
MORE
THOROUGHLY
YOURE
MILEAGE
MAY
VARY
AS
WITH
ANYTHING
ELSE
CHECK
WITH
YOUR
DOCTOR
DONT
JUST
TAKE
MY
WORD
BUT
THIS
IS
THE
INFO
IVE
BEEN
GIVEN
AND
IT
MAY
BE
A
STARTING
POINT
