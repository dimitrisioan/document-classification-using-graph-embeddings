DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
ANY
QUACKS
EXIST
HOW
ABOUT
QUACK
DIAGNOSES
IS
BEING
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
ENOUGH
TO
GUARANTEE
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
NOT
A
QUACK
OR
IS
IT
JUST
THAT
EVEN
IF
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
IS
A
QUACK
OTHER
PEOPLE
SHOULDNT
SAY
SO
CAN
YOU
GIVE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
COMMONLY
DIAGNOSED
AILMENT
THAT
YOU
THINK
IS
A
QUACK
DIAGNOSIS
OR
HAVE
WE
GOTTEN
TO
THE
POINT
IN
CIVILIZATION
WHERE
WE
NO
LONGER
NEED
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
UNSCRUPULOUS
HEALERS
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
PEOPLE
I
WOULD
SAY
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SIGNIFICANT
NUMBERS
OF
UNSCRUPULOUS
DOCTORS
OF
THE
SQUEAKYCLEAN
TRADITIONAL
CREWCUT
TALK
TO
THE
AMA
BEFORE
STARTING
ANY
TREATMENT
KIND
WHO
RECOMMEND
TREATMENTS
THAT
THOUGH
ACCEPTED
MAY
NOT
BE
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
PATIENT
AT
THE
TIME
AND
ALL
FOR
MAKING
A
QUICK
BUCK
I
WOULD
NOT
BE
SURPRISED
IF
THE
COST
OF
MEDICAL
SERVICES
IN
THE
US
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
INFLATED
BY
THESE
QUACKS
OF
A
DIFFERENT
COLOR
IN
FACT
ID
SAY
THESE
DOCTORS
ARE
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
SINCE
THEY
CALL
INTO
QUESTION
THE
TRUE
FOCUS
OF
THE
MEDICAL
PROFESSION
THE
AMA
AND
THE
BOARDS
SHOULD
FOCUS
ON
THESE
QUACKS
INSTEAD
OF
DEVOTING
UNBELIEVABLE
ENERGY
ON
SEARCHAND
DESTROYMISSIONS
TO
PULL
THE
LICENSES
OF
THOSE
DOCTORS
WHO
ARE
TRYING
NON

NOT

ACCEPTED
TREATMENTS
FOR
THEIR
DESPERATE
PATIENTS
THAT
TRADITIONALACCEPTED
MEDICINE
CANNOT
HELP
NOW
TO
MAKE
A
GENERAL
COMMENT
ON
MANY
RECENT
POSTS
LATELY
IVE
SEEN
THE
WORD
QUACK
BANDIED
ABOUT
RECKLESSLY
WHEN
A
DOCTOR
OR
DOCTORWANNABE
HAS
DECIDED
TO
QUIT
DISCUSSING
ANY
CONTROVERSIAL
MEDICAL
SUBJECT
IN
A
CIVILIZED
MANNER
ALL
HESHE
HAS
TO
DO
IS
SAY
QUACKQUACK
AND
SOMEHOW
THEY
MAGICALLY
EXPECT
THE
READERSHIP
OF
THIS
NEWSGROUP
TO
ROLL
OVER
ON
THEIR
BACKS
AND
PEEPEE
ON
THEMSELVES
IN
OBEDIENCE
WHAT
DO
THEY
TEACH
YOU
IN
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
HOW
TO
THROW
YOUR
AUTHORITY
AROUND
LET
ME
PUT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
MAKE
MY
POINT
CLEAR
QUACK
IS
A
NEBULOUS
WORD
LACKING
IN
ANY
PRECISION
ITS
SOLE
USE
IS
TO
OBFUSCATE
THE
ISSUES
AT
HAND
THE
INDISCRIMINATE
USE
OF
THIS
WORD
IS
A
SURE
SIGN
OF
INCOMPETENCY
AND
COMING
FROM
ANY
MEDICAL
DOCTOR
OR
WANNABE
WHERE
COMPETENCY
IS
EXPECTED
IS
REAL
SCARY
BUT
WHAT
DO
I
KNOW
IVE
ALREADY
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
BY
THE

IN

AS
