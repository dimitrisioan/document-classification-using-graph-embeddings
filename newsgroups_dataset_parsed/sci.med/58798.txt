I
WOKE
UP
AT
AM
AND
PUKED
MY
GUTS
OUTS
I
THREW
UP
FOR
SO
LONG
THAT
IM
NOT
KIDDING
I
PULLED
A
MUSCLE
IN
MY
TONGUE
DRY
HEAVES
AND
EVERYTHING
NO
ONE
ELSE
GOT
SICK
AND
IM
NOT
ALLERGIC
TO
ANYTHING
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
THE
FUNNY
THING
IS
THE
PERSONALY
STORIES
ABOUT
REACTIONS
TO
MSG
VARY
SO
GREATLY
SOME
SAID
THAT
THEIR
HEART
BEAT
SPEEDED
UP
WITH
FLUSH
FACE
SOME
CLAIM
THEIR
HEART
SKIPPED
BEATS
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
SOME
REACTED
WITH
HEADACHE
SOME
STOMACH
ACHE
SOME
HAD
WATERY
EYES
OR
RUNNING
NOSE
SOME
HAD
ITCHY
SKIN
OR
RASHES
MORE
SERIOUS
ACCUSATIONS
INCLUDE
RESPIRATION
DIFFICULTY
AND
BRAIN
DAMAGE
NOW
HERE
IS
A
NEW
ONE
VOMITING
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
MSG
BECOMES
THE
NUMBER
ONE
SUSPECT
OF
ANY
PROBLEM
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
MIGHT
BE
JUST
FOOD
POISONING
BUT
IF
YOU
HEARD
THINGS
ABOUT
MSG
YOU
MAY
THINK
IT
MUST
BE
IT
SURPRISE
SURPRISE
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
REACT
DIFFERENTLY
TO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
ONE
SLIGHTLY
OFF
THE
SUBJECT
CASE
IN
POINT
MY
BROTHER
GOT
STUNG
BY
A
BEE
I
KNOW
HE
IS
ALLERGIC
TO
BEE
STINGS
BUT
THAT
HIS
REACTION
IS
SEVERE
LOCALIZED
SWELLING
NOT
ANAPHYLACTIC
SHOCK
I
COULD
NOT
CONVINCE
THE
DOCTORS
OF
THAT
HOWEVER
BECAUSE
THATS
NOT
WRITTEN
IN
THEIR
LITTLE
RULE
BOOK
I
WOULD
NOT
BE
SURPRISED
IN
THE
LEAST
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
BAD
REACTIONS
TO
MSG
INCLUDING
HEADACHES
STOMACHACHES
AND
EVEN
VOMITING
NOT
THAT
THE
STUFF
IS
BAD
OR
POISON
AND
NEEDS
TO
BE
BANNED
BUT
PEOPLE
NEED
TO
BE
AWARE
THAT
IT
CAN
HAVE
A
BAD
EFFECT
ON
SOME
PEOPLE
LONE
WOLF
HAPPY
ARE
THEY
WHO
DREAM
DREAMS
ED
PHILIPS
AND
PAY
THE
PRICE
TO
SEE
THEM
COME
TRUE
UNKNOWN
