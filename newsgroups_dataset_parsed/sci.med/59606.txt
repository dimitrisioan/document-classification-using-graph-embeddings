SLEEP
THE
PULSE
OF
RELAXATION
ROAMING
WHILE
SLEEPING
I
POSTED
ABOUT
A
PULSE
OF
RELAXATION
ELECTRICITY
I
NOW
THINK
IT
MORE
LIKE
A
PULSE
OF
RELAXATION
OR
COMFORT
THAN
A
PULSE
OF
ELECTRICITY
IT
IS
WHAT
YOU
FEEL
IF
YOU
ARE
OVERWHELMED
BY
A
FEELING
OF
COMFORT
SUCH
AS
SEEING
OR
THINKING
ABOUT
SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL
ANOTHER
THING
WHEN
YOU
SLEEP
YOU
LIE
DOWN
FACING
UP
WITH
YOUR
PALMS
ASIDE
OF
YOU
AND
FACING
DOWN
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
BED
THEN
YOU
RELAX
AND
THERE
START
INVOLUNTARY
NERVE
FIRINGS
INSIDE
YOUR
FLESH
SO
YOU
FEEL
A
SHIVER
BELOW
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
SKIN
NOT
HEARTBEAT
THEN
THIS
SHIVER
INCREASES
AND
COMES
UP
TO
YOUR
HEAD
AND
THE
ROAM
YOU
HEAR
LOUDENS
NOTE
THAT
YOU
ALWAYS
HEAR
A
HIGHPITCH
WHEN
YOU
LIE
DOWN
IN
BED
THIS
IS
JUST
THE
NOISE
OF
YOUR
BLOOD
RUNNING
IN
YOUR
EAR
THIS
ROAM
IS
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
HIGH
PITCH
BUT
FOLLOWS
THE
SHIVER
OF
YOUR
BODY
SHIVER
IS
NOT
THE
WORD
IT
MAY
BE
CALLED
A
MILD
VIBRATION
OR
QUAKE
WHAT
IS
THIS
SHIVER
AND
ROAM
CAN
I
USE
THIS
TO
INDUCE
OUTOFBODY
