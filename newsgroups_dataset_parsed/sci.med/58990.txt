is
there
a
righteye
dominance
eyedness
as
there
is
an
overall
righthandedness
in
the
population
i
mean
do
most
people
require
less
lens
corrections
for
the
one
eye
than
the
other
if
so
what
kinds
of
percentages
can
be
attached
to
this
i
have
a
long
sighted
eye
and
a
short
sighted
eye
my
right
eye
tends
to
cut
out
when
i
look
at
distant
things
my
left
eye
when
i
am
close
up
i
had
specs
to
balance
things
up
a
bit
but
could
do
without
them
i
thought
that
one
way
or
another
i
would
always
be
able
to
see
clearly
unfortunately
middle
age
is
rearing
its
ugly
head
and
i
can
no
longer
see
close
up
objects
clearly
maybe
its
just
that
my
arms
are
getting
shorter
the
floggings
will
continue
until
morale
improves
