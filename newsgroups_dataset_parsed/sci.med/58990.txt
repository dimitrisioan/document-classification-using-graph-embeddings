IS
THERE
A
RIGHTEYE
DOMINANCE
EYEDNESS
AS
THERE
IS
AN
OVERALL
RIGHTHANDEDNESS
IN
THE
POPULATION
I
MEAN
DO
MOST
PEOPLE
REQUIRE
LESS
LENS
CORRECTIONS
FOR
THE
ONE
EYE
THAN
THE
OTHER
IF
SO
WHAT
KINDS
OF
PERCENTAGES
CAN
BE
ATTACHED
TO
THIS
I
HAVE
A
LONG
SIGHTED
EYE
AND
A
SHORT
SIGHTED
EYE
MY
RIGHT
EYE
TENDS
TO
CUT
OUT
WHEN
I
LOOK
AT
DISTANT
THINGS
MY
LEFT
EYE
WHEN
I
AM
CLOSE
UP
I
HAD
SPECS
TO
BALANCE
THINGS
UP
A
BIT
BUT
COULD
DO
WITHOUT
THEM
I
THOUGHT
THAT
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
I
WOULD
ALWAYS
BE
ABLE
TO
SEE
CLEARLY
UNFORTUNATELY
MIDDLE
AGE
IS
REARING
ITS
UGLY
HEAD
AND
I
CAN
NO
LONGER
SEE
CLOSE
UP
OBJECTS
CLEARLY
MAYBE
ITS
JUST
THAT
MY
ARMS
ARE
GETTING
SHORTER
THE
FLOGGINGS
WILL
CONTINUE
UNTIL
MORALE
IMPROVES
