WRITES
WHAT
IS
THE
HEALTHIEST
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
EARWAX
SHOULD
ONE
JUST
LEAVE
IT
IN
YOUR
EAR
AND
NOT
MESS
WITH
IT
OR
SHOULD
YOU
CLEAN
IT
OUT
EVERY
SO
OFTEN
CAN
CLEANING
IT
OUT
DAMAGE
YOUR
EARDRUMS
ARE
THERE
ANY
TUBES
IN
YOUR
EAR
THAT
MIGHT
GET
BLOCKED
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
WAX
IS
CAUSING
HEARING
LOSS
CONGESTION
OR
POPPING
IN
THE
EARS
YOU
CAN
TRY
SOME
CAUTIOUS
TEPID
WATER
IRRIGATION
WITH
A
BULB
SYRINGE
BUT
IT
IS
AWKWARD
TO
DO
FOR
ONESELF
AND
MAY
NOT
WORK
OR
MAY
EVEN
MAKE
THINGS
WORSE
MY
WIFE
WOULD
DISAGREE
SHE
DOES
IT
SUCCESSFULLY
EVERY
SIX
MONTHS
OR
SO
IN
ANY
CASE
DO
NOT
ATTEMPT
ANYTHING
WITH
QTIPS
ILL
AGREE
WITH
YOUR
WIFE
WHILE
I
WAS
A
STUDENT
I
HAD
DOCTORS
REMOVE
RATHER
SURPRISING
AMOUNTS
OF
WAX
FROM
MY
EARS
BY
FLUSHING
THEM
OUT
A
COUPLE
TIMES
USUALLY
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
EXAMINING
MY
EARS
FOR
SOME
OTHER
REASON
AND
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
GEE
YOUVE
GOT
A
LOT
OF
WAX
IN
THERE
IN
MY
CASE
REMOVAL
OF
THESE
LARGE
WAX
BUILDUPS
DID
NOTICEABLY
IMPROVE
MY
HEARING
AND
IVE
SINCE
GOTTEN
IN
THE
SAME
HABIT
AS
YOUR
WIFE
OF
FLUSHING
THEM
OUT
WITH
WARM
WATER
FROM
A
LITTLE
RUBBER
BULB
EVERY
FEW
MONTHS
YOU
CAN
BUY
LITTLE
BULBS
TOGETHER
WITH
EAR
DROPS
FOR
THIS
EXPRESS
PURPOSE
FROM
THE
DRUG
STORE
I
DONT
NOTICE
THAT
THE
DROPS
ACCOMPLISH
MUCH
OF
ANYTHING
ONE
QUESTION
I
DO
HAVE
A
DOCTOR
WHO
FLUSHED
OUT
MY
EARS
ONCE
ALSO
ADVOCATED
A
DROP
OF
RUBBING
ALCOHOL
IN
THEM
AFTERWARDS
TO
FLUSH
OUT
ANY
REMAINING
TRAPPED
WATER
SAID
HE
TOLD
SWIMMERS
TO
DO
THIS
AFTER
SWIMMING
TOO
IT
WORKS
BUT
IT
STINGS
LIKE
THE
DEVIL
SO
IVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
CONTENT
TO
LET
ANY
WATER
IN
MY
EARS
FROM
SWIMMING
OR
FLUSHING
THEM
OUT
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
TO
GET
OUT
BY
ITSELF
IF
SHAKING
MY
HEAD
A
FEW
TIMES
WONT
DO
THE
TRICK
ANY
COMMENTS
