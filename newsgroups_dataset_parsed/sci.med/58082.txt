ANTERO
JULKUNEN
WRITES
THERE
IS
THIS
NEWSGROUP
SCIMEDPHYSICS
AND
THERE
HAS
BEEN
QUITE
A
LOT
DISCUSSION
IN
THIS

ABOUT
MANY
CHEMICAL
ITEMS
EG
PROLACTIN
CHOLESTEROL
TSH
ETC
SHOULD
THERE
ALSO
BE
A
NEWSGROUP
SCIMEDCHEMISTRY
ITS
GOT
POTENTIAL
INSTEAD
OF
CHEMISTRY
HOW
ABOUT
SPLITTING
THE
CLASSIFICATION

BIOCHEMISTRY
WHICH
ARE
PROBABLY
THE
TOPICS
YOURE
THINKING
OF
AND
PHARMACEUTICAL
WHICH
OTHERWISE
MIGHT
END
UP
IN
BIOCHEMISTRY
THIS

SEPARATE
FROM
THE
ISSUE
OF
WHETHER
THERE
IS
SUFFICIENT
POTENTIAL
NEWS
VOLUME
TO

OR
BOTH
GROUPS
ILL
