RE
ANTIHISTAMINE
FOR
SLEEP
AID
BUT
AFTER
YOU
HAVE
TAKEN
ANTIHISTAMINES
FOR
A
FEW
NIGHTS
DOESNT
IT
START
TO
HAVE
A
PARADOXICAL
EFFECT
I
USED
TO
TAKE
ONE
EVERY
NIGHT
FOR
ALLERGIES
AND
COULDNT
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
I
DEVELOPED
BAD
INSOMNIA
FINALLY
FIGURED
OUT
IT
WAS
THE
ANTIHISTAMINES
I
WOULD
FALL
ASLEEP
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
BUT
WOULD
AWAKEN
AT
THE
DROP
OF
A
PIN
A
LITTLE
LATER
AND
COULD
NOT
GET
BACK
TO
SLEEP
I
DONT
HAVE
THAT
PROBLEM
SINCE
I
STOPPED
THE
ANTIHISTAMINES
AT
BEDTIME
ALICE
