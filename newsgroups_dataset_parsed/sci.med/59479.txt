columbus
was
indeed
a
crank
but
not
in
the
manner
you
think
the
fact
that
the
world
was
round
was
well
known
when
he
set
sail
it
was
also
well
known
that
the
circumference
was
about
miles
and
that
you
could
not
reach
asia
bo
going
west
with
current
technology
you
would
neither
be
able
to
carry
enough
supplies
nor
get
a
long
enough
stretch
of
good
sailing
weather
nobody
thought
he
would
fall
off
the
edge
of
the
world
instead
they
expected
him
to
die
at
sea
columbus
thought
for
no
good
reason
that
the
circumference
was
only
miles
making
the
trip
practical
unfortunately
for
columbus
and
his
shipmates
the
earths
circumference
is
indeed
miles
fortunately
for
columbus
and
his
shipmates
there
was
a
stopping
place
right
about
where
asia
would
have
been
had
the
circumference
been
miles
my
source
is

recent
