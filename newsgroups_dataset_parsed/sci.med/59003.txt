WALTER
F
LUNDBY
WRITES
AS
NOBODY
IN
THE
FOOD
INDUSTRY
HAS
EVEN
BOTHERED
TO
ADDRESS
MY
PREVIOUS
QUESTION
WHY
DO
YOU
NEED
TO
PUT
MSG
IN
ALMOST
EVERY
FOOD
I
MUST
ASSUME
THAT
MY
WIFES
ANSWER
IS
CLOSER
TO
THE
TRUTH
THAN
I
HOPED
IT
WAS
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
BE
DISRESPECTFUL
TO
YOUR
CONCERNS
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOURE
GETTING
ALL
WOUND
UP
IN
A
NONISSUE
AS
MANY
KNOWLEDGEABLE
PEOPLE
HAVE
POINTED
OUT
MSG
IS
A
NATURALLY
OCCURRING
SUBSTANCE
IN
A
LOT
IF
NOT
MOST
FOODS
WHEN
FOOD
MANUFACTURERS
ADD
IT
TO
A
PREPARATION
THEY
DO
SO
BECAUSE
ITS
A
KNOWN
FLAVOR
ENHANCER
YOUR
WIFES
THEORY
THAT
MSG
IS
ADDED
TO
FOOD
TO
STIMULATE
APPETITE
MAY
WELL
BE
TRUE
BUT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ITS
ALWAYS
THE
REASON
ITS
ADDED
PEOPLE
ARE
LARGELY
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
IN
CHARGE
OF
THEIR
OWN
APPETITES
CHILDRENS
AND
MY
PARENTS
SEEM
TO
FIXATE
ON
A
PARTICULAR
BRAND
OF
PET
FOOD
THE
CAT
WILL
EAT
ANY
PRODUCT
WITHIN
ONE
BRAND
AND
NOT
ANY
OTHER
BRAND
I
HAVE
WONDERED
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
A
CASE
OF
PREFERENCE
BUT
SOME
SORT
OF
CHEMICAL
TRAINING
OR
ADDICTION
MY
QUESTIONS
FOR
THE
NET
ARE
DOES
THE
FDA
REGULATE
THE
CONTENTS
OF
PET
FOOD
IS
IT
ALLOWED
FOR
PET
FOOD
TO
CONTAIN
ADDICTIVE
OR
CONDITIONING
SUBSTANCES
IS
MSG
PUT
IN
PET
FOOD
YOU
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
CATS
DO
YOU
CATS
WILL
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
YOU
RESIGN
YOURSELF
YOU
WILL
NEVER
UNDERSTAND
A
CAT
THEIR
TASTES
ARE
WHIMSICAL
I
ALSO
SUSPECT
THOUGH
ITS
BEEN
A
WHILE
SINCE
IVE
CHECKED
INGREDIENTS
ON
COMMERCIAL
CAT
FOOD
THAT
THERE
ARE
MUCH
MORE
STRINGENT
REQUIREMENTS
ON
PET
FOOD
ADDITIVES
THAN
HUMAN
SEE
THE
FDA
HAS
THIS
STUPID
IDEA
THAT
HUMAN
BEINGS
HAVE
THE
INTELLIGENCE
TO
LOOK
OUT
AFTER
THEIR
OWN
INTERESTS

WONDERING
HOW
HER
CAT
WOULD
TAKE
CARE
OF
HER
