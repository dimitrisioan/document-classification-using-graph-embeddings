MSG
IS
COMMON
IN
MANY
FOOD
WE
EAT
INCLUDING
CHINESE
THOUGH
SOME
ORIENTAL
RESTAURANTS
MIGHT
PUT
A
TAD
TOO
MUCH
IN
THEM
IVE
NOTICED
THAT
WHEN
I
GO
OUT
AND
EAT
IN
MOST
OF
THE
CHINESE
FOOD
RESTAURANTS
I
WILL
USUALLY
GET
A
SLIGHT
HEADACHE
AND
AN
UNUNSUAL
THIRST
AFTERWARDS
THIS
HAPPENS
TO
MANY
OF
MY
FRIENDS
AND
RELATIVES
TOO
AND
HEH
WE
EAT
CHINESE
FOOD
ALL
THE
TIME
AT
HOME
BUT
WE
DONT
USE
MSG
WHEN
WERE
COOKING
FOR
OURSELVES
SO
WHEN
WE
PUT
ONE
AND
ONE
TOGETHER
IT
CAN
BE
SAFELY
ASSUMED
THAT
MSG
MAY
CAUSE
SOME
ALLERGIC
REACTIONS
IN
SOME
PEOPLE
STICK
WITH
NATURAL
THINGS
MSG
DOESNT
DO
BODY
ANY
GOOD
AND
POSSIBLY
HARMS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
SO
WHY
BOTHER
WITH
IT
TASTE
FOOD
AS
IT
SHOULD
BE
TASTED
AND
DONT
CLOUD
THE
FLAVOR
WITH
AN
IMAGINARY
CLOAK
OF
MSG
AS
I
UNDERSTOOD
IT
MSG
IS
NATURAL
ISNT
IT
FOUND
IN
TOMATOES
ANYWAY
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
ARE
TERRIBLY
ALLERGIC
TO
LOTS
OF
NATURAL
THINGS
PEANUTS
ONIONS
TOMATOES
MILK
ETC
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
IS
NATURAL
DOESNT
MEAN
IT
WONT
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
WITH
SOME
FOLKS
AS
FOR
HOW
FOODS
TASTE
IF
IM
NOT
ALLERGIC
TO
MSG
AND
I
LIKE
THE
TASTE
OF
IT
WHY
SHOULDNT
I
USE
IT
SAYING
I
SHOULDNT
USE
IT
IS
LIKE
SAYING
I
SHOULDNT
EAT
SPICY
FOOD
BECAUSE
MY
NEIGHBOR
HAS
AN
ULCER
PEOPLE
HAVE
LONG
MODIFIED
THE
TASTE
OF
FOOD
BY
ADDITIVES
WHETHER
THEY
BE
CHILES
BLACK
PEPPER
SALT
CREAM
SAUCES
ETC
ALL
OF
THESE
THINGS
CLOUD
THE
FLAVOR
OF
THE
FOOD
WHY
DO
WE
BOTHER
WITH
THEM
HOW
SHOULD
FOOD
BE
TASTED
ISNT
IT
