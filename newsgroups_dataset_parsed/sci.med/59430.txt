SCHATZKI
RING
PVCS
CAN
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
PROVIDE
ME
WITH
ANY
ADVICE
CONCERNING
THE
FOLLOWING
TWO
HEALTH
PROBLEMS
FIRST
I
WAS
RECENTLY
DIAGNOSED
USING
A
UGI
SERIES
AS
HAVING
A
SCHATZKI
RING
AND
SMALL
SLIDING
HIATAL
HERNIA
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
THE
HERNIA
IS
A
RELATIVELY
MINOR
PROBLEM
THOUGH
I
DO
OCCASIONALLY
HAVE
SOME
NASTY
HEARTBURN
THAT
IS
PROBABLY
RELATED
TO
IT
THE
SCHATZKI
RING
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
CAUSING
SWALLOWING
DIFFICULTY
IN
PARTICULAR
IF
IM
NOT
CAREFUL
ABOUT
EATING
SLOWLY
AND
THOROUGHLY
CHEWING
FOOD
FOOD
OCCASIONALLY
GETS
STUCK
BEFORE
REACHING
MY
STOMACH
THIS
RESULTS
IN
A
PERIOD
OF
PAINFUL
SPASMS
AS
THE
FOOD
ATTEMPTS
TO
PASS
THE
OBSTRUCTION
FORTUNATELY
THE
FOOD
HAS
ALWAYS
MANAGED
TO
PASS
BUT
THIS
IS
ANNOYING
AND
CAUSES
FREQUENT
DISCOMFORT
MY
DOCTOR
WANTS
TO
DILATE
THE
RING
USING
THE
FOLLOWING
PROCEDURE
USE
AN
ENDOSCOPE
TO
EXAMINE
THE
ESOPHAGUS
AND
STOMACH
FOR
ANY
INFLAMMATION
THEN
CUT
THROUGH
THE
RING
AND
DILATE
IT
BY
PASSING
SOME
KIND
OF
BALLOON
OR
SOMETHING
THRU
THE
ESOPHAGOUS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HAS
HAD
THIS
OR
A
SIMILAR
PROCEDURE
DONEIF
SO
WAS
IT
PAINFUL
SUCCESSFUL
ETC
ALSO
CAN
ANYONE
COMMENT
ON
SAFETY
ADVISABILITY
AND
SUCCESS
RATE
OF
THIS
PROCEDURE
HAS
IT
BECOME
A
COMMON
PROCEDURE
I
AM
KIND
OF
LEERY
OF
HAVING
SUCH
AN
INVASIVESOUNDING
PROCEDURE
PERFORMED
FOR
A
CURRENTLY
NONTHREATENING
CONDITION
SUCH
AS
THIS
ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING
THE
POSSIBLE
SIDE
EFFECTS
BLEEDING
PERFORATION
REACTION
TO
ANESTHESIA
THE
SECOND
ISSUE
FOR
THE
PAST
YEARS
I
HAVE
HAD
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
EXTRA
HEARTBEATS
IN
PARTICULAR
DURING
THE
PAST
MONTH
OR
SO
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
DRAMATIC
INCREASEA
HOLTER
MONITOR
RECENTLY
SHOWED
PVCS
IN
HRS
ALONG
WITH
A
FEW
PACS
MANY
DAYS
THERE
ARE
FAR
MORE
THAN
THIS
HOWEVERFIVE
TO
TEN
PER
HOUR
ALL
OF
THEM
WERE
ISOLATED
AND
THE
CARDIOLOGIST
INDICATED
THAT
SUCH
A
NUMBER
WAS
NORMAL
IT
CERTAINLY
DOESNT
FEEL
NORMAL
IN
THE
PAST
THERE
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
A
COUPLE
OF
EPISODES
OF
EXTENDED
RUNS
OF
THESE
BEATS
ONE
OF
WHICH
LASTED
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
CAUSE
SEVERE
LIGHTHEADEDNESS
I
AM
RELATIVELY
YOUNG
THIN
AND
IN
GOOD
HEALTH
RECENT
BLOODTESTS
WERE
ALL
NORMAL
AND
DO
NOT
SMOKE
USE
DRUGS
OR
CAFFEINE
ETC
IM
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
EXTRA
BEATS
AS
NORMAL
BUT
DONT
WANT
TO
IGNORE
THEM
IF
THEY
MIGHT
BE
SOME
KIND
OF
WARNING
SYMPTOM
THE
NUMBER
OF
PVCS
SEEMS
TO
INCREASE
THROUGHOUT
THE
DAY
AND
WITH
EXERCISE
OR
SOMETHING
AS
SIMPLE
AS
CLIMBING
SOME
STAIRS
ALSO
IF
I
GET
UP
AFTER
SITTING
OR
LYING
DOWN
FOR
A
WHILE
I
TEND
TO
GET
A
COUPLE
OF
EXTRA
BEATS
COULD
THEY
POSSIBLY
BE
RELATED
TO
THE
ESOPHAGOUS
PROBLEMS
BOTH
SEEMED
TO
DEVELOP
AT
ABOUT
THE
SAME
TIME
THANKS
FOR
ANY
HELPADVICE
