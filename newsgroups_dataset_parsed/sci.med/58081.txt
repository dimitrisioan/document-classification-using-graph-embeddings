RUTH
GINZBERG
THANKS
TO
ALL
THOSE
WHO
RESPONDED
TO
MY
ORIGINAL
POST
ON
THIS
QUESTION
THE
FINAL
DIAGNOSIS
WAS
STRESS
I
DID
NOT
TAKE
HER
FOR
A
CHIROPRACTIC
ADJUSTMENT
RACHEL
RECEIVES
ALL
HER
MEDICAL
CARE
AT
KELLER
ARMY
HOSPITAL
SINCE
SHE
IS
A
MILITARY
DEPENDANT
AND
THE
ARMY
DOES
NOT
YET
PROVIDE
CHIROPRACTIC
ADJUSTMENTS
AS
PART
OF
ITS
REGULAR
HEALTH
CARE
I
AM
HOPING
THAT
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
SPRING
BREAK
AND
COLLEGE
ACCEPTANCE
LETTERS
WILL
HELP
UNFORTUNATELY
SHE
WAS
WAITLISTED
AT
THE
COLLEGE
SHE
MOST
DEARLY
WANTED
TO
ATTEND
SO
IT
SEEMS
AS
THOUGH
THAT
STRESSOR
MAY
JUST
CONTINUE
FOR
A
WHILE
MEANWHILE
SHE
IS
GOING
ON
A
CAMPING
TRIP
WITH
HER
RELIGIOUS
YOUTH
GROUP
FOR
SPRING
BREAK
WHICH
SEEMS
LIKE
A
GOOD
STRESSRELIEVER
TO
ME
THANKS
AGAIN
FOR
