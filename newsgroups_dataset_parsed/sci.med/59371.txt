re
thermogenics
first
off
if
im
not
mistaken
only
hibernating
animals
have
brown
fat
not
humans
secondly
your
description
sounds
just
like
this
is
an
uncoupler
of
respiratory
chain
oxidative
phosphorylation
put
in
laymans
terms
it
shortcircuits
the
mitochondria
causing
food
energy
to
be
turned
into
heat
was
popular
in
the
for
weight
reduction
in
controlled
amounts
it
raises
body
temperature
as
the
body
compensates
for
the
reduced
amount
of
useful
energy
available
it
is
very
dangerous
it
would
be
wiser
to
adjust
to
your
present
body
form
rather
than
play
around
with
but
if
you
insist
i
suggest
you
look
up
the
literature
in
your
own
university
library
you
can
obtain
by
taking
a
first
year
organic
chemistry
lab
course
and
swiping
it
from
the
supplies
its
a
commonlyused
reagent
