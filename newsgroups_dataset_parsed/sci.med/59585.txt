CAN
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
TELL
ME
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
PERSISTENT
DISEASE
AND
A
CHRONIC
ONE
FOR
EXAMPLE
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
VS
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
IS
A
GENERAL
DISTINCTION
RATHER
THERE
ARE
TWO
CLASSES
OF
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
AND
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
I
CANT
THINK
OF
ANY
OTHER
DISEASE
WHERE
THE
TERM
PERSISTENT
IS
USED
WITH
OR
IN
PREFERENCE
TO
CHRONIC
MUCH
AS
THESE
TWO
TERMS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
AND
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
SOUND
FUZZY
THE
ACTUAL
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
CONDITIONS
IS
OFTEN
FAIRLY
FUZZY
AS
WELL
I
BEG
TO
DIFFER
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
IMPLIES
THAT
THE
DISEASE
REMAINS
ACTIVE
AND
GENERALLY
LEADS
TO
LIVER
FAILURE
AT
THE
VERY
MINIMUM
THE
PATIENT
HAS
PERSISTENTLY
ELEVATED
LIVER
ENZYMES
WHAT
SOME
CALL
TRANSAMINITIS
CHRONIC
PERSISTANT
HEPATITIS
SIMPLY
MEANS
THAT
THE
PATIENT
HAS
HBSAG
IN
HISHER
BLOOD
AND
CAN
TRANSMIT
THE
INFECTION
BUT
SHOWS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
PROGRESSIVE
DISEASE
IF
I
HAD
TO
CHOOSE
ID
MUCH
RATHER
HAVE
THE
PERSISTANT
TYPE
