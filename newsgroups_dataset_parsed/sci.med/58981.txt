RE
SCIENCE
AND
METHODOLOGY
WAS
HOMEOPATHY
TRADITION
I
THINK
THAT
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
I
HAVE
PROPOSED
A
DEFINITION
OF
SCIENCE
THAT
I
INTENDED
TO
BE
INTERPRETED
BROADLY
AND
THAT
LEE
LADY
HAS
INTERPRETED
FAIRLY
NARROWLY
MY
DEFINITION
IS
THIS
SCIENCE
IS
THE
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
EMPIRICAL
THAT
AVOIDS
MISTAKES
IN
REASONING
AND
METHODOLOGY
DISCOVERED
FROM
PREVIOUS
WORK
LEE
LADY
WRITES
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
SCIENCE
SHOULD
BE
DEFINED
IN
A
WAY
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
ACTIVITIES
THAT
LEAD
TO
REALLY
IMPORTANT
SCIENCE
NAMELY
THINKING
AND
INFORMAL
EXPLORATION
ARE
NOT
RECOGNIZED
AS
SCIENTIFIC
WORK
UNLESS
ONE
CLASSIFIES
THINKING
AND
INFORMAL
EXPLORATION
AS
A
MISTAKE
THEY
FALL
UNDER
MY
DEFINITION
I
HOPE
NO
ONE
WOULD
CONSIDER
SPECULATION
THINKING
AND
INFORMAL
EXPLORATION
AS
UNSCIENTIFIC
IN
ARTICLE
LADYUHUNIXUHCCHAWAIIEDU
LEE
LADY
WRITES
SERIOUSLY
IM
NOT
SURE
WHETHER
I
MISJUDGED
YOU
OR
NOT
IN
ONE
RESPECT
I
STILL
HAVE
A
MAJOR
PROBLEM
THOUGH
WITH
YOUR
INSISTENCE
THAT
SCIENCE
IS
MAINLY
ABOUT
AVOIDING
MISTAKES
HERE
IS
WHERE
I
THINK
WE
ARE
TALKING
AT
CROSSPURPOSES
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
THE
KIND
OF
DEFINITION
I
HAVE
PROPOSED
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
AS
DESCRIBING
WHAT
SCIENCE
IS
MAINLY
ABOUT
CONSIDER
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
DEFINITION
OF
INVERTEBRATES
AS
ALL
ANIMALS
LACKING
A
BACKBONE
THIS
FAIRLY
TELLS
WHAT
IS
AN
INVERTEBRATE
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
AN
INVERTEBRATE
BUT
IT
HARDLY
TELLS
YOU
WHAT
INVERTEBRATES
ARE
ALL
ABOUT
ONE
CAN
READ
THIS
DEFINITION
AND
STILL
NOT
KNOW
THAT
OF
ALL
ANIMAL
SPECIES
ARE
INVERTEBRATES
THAT
INVERTEBRATES
POSSESS
A
REMARKABLY
BROAD
RANGE
OF
FORM
THAT
SOME
INVERTEBRATE
GROUPS
SUCH
AS
INSECTS
AND
NEMATODES
ARE
UBIQUITOUS
IN
ALL
ECOSYSTEMS
ETC
IN
SHORT
KNOWING
THE
DEFINITION
OF
INVERTEBRATES
DOES
NOT
TELL
ONE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
MAINLY
ABOUT
THE
MISUNDERSTANDING
HERE
IS
MY
FAULT
I
DID
NOT
GIVE
SUFFICIENT
CONTEXT
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
UNDERSTAND
MY
PROPOSED
DEFINITION
OKAY
SO
LETS
SEE
IF
WE
AGREE
ON
THIS
FIRST
OF
ALL
THERE
ARE
DEGREES
OF
CERTAINTY
IT
MIGHT
BE
APPROPRIATE
FOR
INSTANCE
TO
DEMAND
CAREFULLY
CONTROLLED
TRIALS
BEFORE
WE
ACCEPT
AS
ABSOLUTE
SCIENTIFIC
TRUTH
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
THERE
IS
ANY
SUCH
THING
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
A
CERTAIN
TREATMENT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HIGHLY
FAVORABLE
CLINICAL
EXPERIENCE
EVEN
IF
UNCONTROLLED
CAN
BE
ADEQUATE
TO
JUSTIFY
A
PRELIMINARY
JUDGEMENT
THAT
A
TREATMENT
IS
USEFUL
SECONDLY
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
BE
MORE
TOLERANT
IN
OUR
STANDARDS
OF
EVIDENCE
FOR
A
PRONOUNCED
EFFECT
THAN
FOR
ONE
THAT
IS
MARGINAL
I
AGREE
ON
BOTH
COUNTS
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
SECOND
IT
WOULD
ONLY
TAKE
A
FEW
CASES
OF
CURING
RABIES
TO
CONVINCE
MOST
VETERINARIANS
THAT
A
TREATMENT
WAS
EFFECTIVE
DESPITE
A
LACK
OF
CONTROLS
AS
TO
THE
FIRST
I
DO
NOT
THINK
IT
IS
USEFUL
TO
TALK
ABOUT
ABSOLUTE
SCIENTIFIC
TRUTH
I
THINK
IT
IS
MORE
USEFUL
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THE
KINDS
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
VARIOUS
CLAIMS
HAVE
AND
THE
KINDS
OF
EVIDENCE
IN
PARTICULAR
FIELDS
THAT
IN
THE
PAST
HAVE
PROVEN
FAULTY
OR
RELIABLE
THE
LATTER
IS
OBVIOUSLY
A
MATTER
OF
DEGREE
AND
IN
EACH
FIELD
PRACTITIONERS
TRY
TO
DISCOVER
THE
RELEVANCE
OF
DIFFERENT
KINDS
OF
EVIDENCE
ONE
OF
THE
PRIMARY
MISTAKES
THAT
MARKS
THE
ADVOCACY
OF
AN
IDEA
AS
PSUEDOSCIENCE
IS
THAT
THE
ADVOCACY
LACKS
ANY
SENSE
OF
PROPORTION
REGARDING
THE
KINDS
OF
EVIDENCE
RELATED
TO
THE
PROPOSED
CLAIM
THE
KINDS
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
ARE
ACTUALLY
RELEVANT
TO
IT
AND
THE
HISTORICAL
REASONS
IN
THE
FIELD
THAT
CERTAIN
KINDS
OF
EVIDENCE
ARE
GIVEN
MORE
WEIGHT
THAN
OTHERS
IT
IS
PERFECTLY
ALRIGHT
TO
SPECULATE
I
HAVE
READ
QUITE
A
FEW
REFEREED
PAPERS
THAT
SPECULATED
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
BUT
THE
AUTHORS
WERE
CAREFUL
TO
IDENTIFY
THE
NOTIONS
AS
SPECULATIVE
TO
LIST
WHAT
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
WAS
PRESENTLY
AVAILABLE
FOR
THEM
AND
TO
DESCRIBE
HOW
RESEARCH
COULD
PROCEED
TO
EITHER
PUT
THE
NOTION
ON
MORE
FIRM
FOOTING
OR
TO
UNCOVER
ITS
PROBLEMS
OFTEN
WHAT
DISTINGUISHES
WHETHER
A
PAPER
OF
THIS
SORT
PASSES
MUSTER
IS
THE
THOUGHTFULNESS
WITH
WHICH
THE
AUTHOR
SETS
THE
CONTEXT
AND
PAVES
THE
WAY
FOR
FUTURE
WORK
IT
IS
IN
THIS
AREA
THAT
MANY
PROPONENTS
OF
SPECULATIVE
IDEAS
FAIL
THE
FOLKS
OVER
IN
SCIPSYCHOLOGY
HAVE
A
HUNDRED
AND
ONE
EXCUSES
NOT
TO
MAKE
THIS
SIMPLE
TEST
THEY
CLAIM
THAT
ONLY
AN
ELABORATE
OUTCOME
STUDY
WILL
BE
SATISFACTORY
A
STUDY
OF
THE
SORT
THAT
NLP
PRACTITIONERS
MANY
OF
WHOM
MAKE
A
BARELY
MARGINAL
LIVING
FROM
THEIR
PRACTICE
CAN
ILL
AFFORD
TO
DO
MOST
OF
THEM
ARE
ALSO
JUST
PLAIN
NOT
INTERESTED
BECAUSE
THE
WHOLE
IDEA
SEEMS
FRIVOLOUS
AND
SINCE
THEYRE
NOT
PART
OF
THE
SCIENTIFIC
ESTABLISHMENT
THEY
HAVE
NO
TANGIBLE
REWARDS
TO
GAIN
FROM
SCIENTIFIC
ACCEPTANCE
I
THINK
A
LOT
OF
SCIENTISTS
STEER
AWAY
FROM
THINGS
THAT
DESERVING
OR
NOT
GARNER
A
PATINA
OF
KOOKINESS
WHEN
PROPONENTS
OF
SOME
PRACTICE
SEE
NO
VALUE
IN
MORE
CAREFUL
INVESTIGATION
OF
THAT
PRACTICE
THAT
SETS
ALARMS
RINGING
IN
MANY
RESEARCHERS
MINDS
THIS
IS
UNFORTUNATE
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
UNDOUBTEDLY
SOME
INTERSECTION
BETWEEN
THINGS
THAT
ARE
WORTH
INVESTIGATING
AND
THINGS
THAT
ARE
ADVOCATED
BY
THOSE
WHO
SEEM
CARELESS
OR
UNREASONABLE
IN
THEIR
ADVOCACY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
WHY
MANY
SCIENTISTS
WOULD
JUST
AS
SOON
SELECT
OTHER
DIRECTIONS
FOR
RESEARCH
AS
GORDON
BANKS
HAS
POINTED
OUT
NO
ONE
WANTS
TO
BECOME
THIS
GENERATIONS
RHINE
ONE
ACADEMIC
IN
SCIPSYCHOLOGY
SAID
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
COMPLETELY
UNSCIENTIFIC
FOR
HIM
TO
TEST
THE
PHOBIA
CURE
SINCE
IT
HASNT
BEEN
DESCRIBED
IN
A
SCIENTIFIC
JOURNAL
I
THINK
THIS
IS
ABSURD
ACTUALLY
AT
LEAST
ONE
FAIRLY
CAREFUL
ACADEMIC
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
DONE
WITH
FAVORABLE
RESULTS
BUT
ITS
APPARENTLY
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
BECAUSE
ITS
A
DOCTORAL
DISSERTATION
AND
NOT
PUBLISHED
IN
A
REFEREED
JOURNAL
I
WONDER
WHY
THE
RESULTS
WERE
NOT
PUBLISHED
IN
MY
FIELD
DISSERTATION
RESULTS
ARE
TYPICALLY
SUMMARIZED
IN
PAPERS
THAT
ARE
SUBMITTED
TO
JOURNALS
OFTEN
THE
PAPERS
ARE
ACCEPTED
FOR
PUBLICATION
BEFORE
THE
DISSERTATION
IS
FINISHED
THIS
CERTAINLY
EASES
ONES
DEFENSE
FINALLY
I
HOPE
LEE
LADY
WILL
FORGIVE
ME
FROM
COMMENTING
EITHER
ON
NLP
OR
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
IT
IN
SCIPSYCHOLOGY
I
KNOW
LITTLE
ABOUT
EITHER
AND
SO
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
OFFER
RUSSELL
