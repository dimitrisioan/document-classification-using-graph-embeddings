WHAT
ABOUT

INFAMOUS
DERIVATION
OF
THE
IDEA
OF
BENZENE
RINGS
FROM
A
DAYDREAM
OF
SNAKES
IN
THE
FIRE
BITING
THEIR
TAILS
IS
THIS
SPECIFIC
ENOUGH
TO
COUNT
CERTAINLY
IT
TURNS
UP
REPEATEDLY
IN
BASIC
PHIL
OF
SCI
TEXTS
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
INVENTIVE
COMPONENT
OF
HYPOTHESIZING
AND
HAS
BEEN
RATHER
THOROUGHLY
DEMOLISHED
AS
MYTH
BY

DISCOVERING
RING
STRUCTURES
FOR
BENZENE
HAD
BEEN
PROPOSED
BEFORE
KEKULE
AFTER
HIM
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AS
HIM
THE
CURRENT
MODELS
DO
NOT
RESEMBLE
KEKULES
MANY
OF
THE
PREDECESSORS
OF

THE

MODEL
MORE
I
DONT
THINK
EXTRASCIENTIFIC
IS
A
VERY
USEFUL
PHRASE
IN
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
BOUNDARIES
OF
SCIENCE
EXCEPT
AS
A
PROPOSED
DEFINIENS
EXTRARATIONAL
IS
A
BETTER
PHRASE
IN
FACT
THERE
ARE
QUITE
A
NUMBER
OF
WELLKNOWN
CASES
OF
EXTRARATIONAL
CONSIDERATIONS
DRIVING
SCIENCE
IN
A
USEFUL
DIRECTION
FOR
EXAMPLE
PASTEUR
DISCOVERED
THAT
RACEMIC
ACID
WAS
A
MIXTURE
OF
ENANTIOMERS
THE
ORIGIN
OF
STEREOCHEMISTRY
PARTLY
BECAUSE
HE
LIKED
A
FRIENDS
CRANK
THEORY
OF
CHEMICAL
ACTION
THE
FRIEND
WAS
WRONG
BUT
PASTEURS
DISCOVERY
STOOD
A
PRIOR
INVESTIGATOR
MITSCHERLICH
LOOKING
AT
THE
SAME
PHENOMENON
HAD
MISSED
A
CRUCIAL
DETAIL
PRESUMABLY
BECAUSE
HE
LACKED
PASTEURS
MOTIVATION
TO
FIND
SOMETHING
THAT
DISTINGUISHED
RACEMIC
ACID
FROM
TARTARIC
NOW
WE
SAY
DTARTARIC
ACID
AGAIN
PASTEUR
DISCOVERED
THE
DIFFERENTIAL
FERMENTATION
OF
ENANTIOMERS
TARTARIC
ACID
AGAIN
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
SOME
RATIONAL
CONVICTION
BUT
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
PRODUCE
YEAST
THAT
LIVED
ON
LTARTARIC
ACID
HIS
NOTEBOOKS
CONTAINED
FANTASIES
OF
BECOMING
THE
NEWTON
OF
MIRRORIMAGE
LIFE
WHICH
HE
NEVER
ADMITTED
PUBLICALLY
PERHAPS
THE
BEST
EXAMPLE
IS
THE
DISCOVERY
THAT

OF
