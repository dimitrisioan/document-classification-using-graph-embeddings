RE
JIGGERS
I
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
WORLDS
GREATEST
EXPERT
ON
CHIGGERS
A
TYPE
OF
MITE
INDIGENOUS
TO
THE
SOUTH
BUT
I
CERTAINLY
HAVE
SPENT
A
LOT
OF
TIME
CONTEMPLATING
THE
LITTLE
BUGGERS
OVER
THE
PAST
SIX
YEARS
SINCE
WE
MOVED
TO
NC
HERE
ARE
SOME
OBSERVATIONS
GAINED
FROM
PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE
REACTIONS
TO
CHIGGERS
VARY
GREATLY
FROM
PERSON
TO
PERSON
SOME
PEOPLE
GET
TINY
RED
BITES
OTHERS
LIKE
ME
ARE
MORE
SENSITIVE
AND
GET
FAIRLY
LARGE
SWOLLEN
SORELIKE
AFFAIRS
CHIGGER
BITES
ARE
THE
GIFT
THAT
KEEPS
ON
GIVING
I
SWEAR
THAT
THESE
THINGS
WILL
ITCH
FOR
MONTHS
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
FOLKLORE
ABOUT
CHIGGERS
I
THINK
MOST
OF
IT
IS
FICTION
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
DO
RESEARCH
ON
THE
CRITTERS
SINCE
THEY
HAVE
SUCH
AN
EFFECT
ON
ME
THE
ONLY
BOOK
I
COULD
FIND
ON
THE
SUBJECT
WAS
A
SINGLE
BOOK
IN
UNCS
SPECIAL
COLLECTIONS
LIBRARY
I
HAVE
NOT
YET
GONE
THROUGH
WHAT
IS
REQUIRED
TO
GET
IT
BASED
ON
MY
EXPERIENCE
AND
THAT
OF
MY
FAMILY
MEMBERS
THE
OLD
FOLK
REMEDY
OF
FINGERNAIL
POLISH
SIMPLY
DOESNT
WORK
I
RECALL
READING
THAT
THE
THEORY
UPON
WHICH
IT
IS
BASED
THAT
THE
CHIGGERS
BURROW
INTO
YOUR
SKIN
AND
CONTINUE
TO
PARTY
THERE
IS
FALSE
I
THINK
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
THE
REACTION
IS
TO
TOXINS
OF
SOME
SORT
THE
LITTLE
PESTS
RELEASE
BUT
THIS
IS
SPECULATION
THE
BEST
APPROACH
IS
PREVENTION
A
COUPLE
OF
THINGS
WORK
WELL
A
GOOD
INSECT
REPELLENT
DEET
SUCH
AS
DEEP
WOODS
OFF
LIBERALLY
APPLIED
TO
ANKLES
WAISTBAND
ETC
IS
A
GOOD
START
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
PREPARATION
CALLED
CHIG
AWAY
THAT
IS
A
COMBINATION
OF
SULFUR
AND
SOME
KIND
OF
CREAM
CORTISONE
THAT
ORIGINALLY
WAS
PREPARED
FOR
THE
ARMY
AND
IS
NOT
COMMERCIALLY
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
SUMMER
I
PUT
THIS
ON
MY
ANKLES
EVERY
MORNING
WHEN
I
GET
UP
ON
WEEKENDS
SINCE
I
LITERALLY
CANT
GO
OUTSIDE
WHERE
WE
LIVE
IN
THE
COUNTRY
WITHOUT
SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES
THEY
APPARENTLY
DONT
LIKE
SULFUR
MUCH
AT
ALL
YOU
CAN
USE
SULFUR
AS
A
DUST
ON
YOUR
BODY
OR
CLOTHING
TO
REPEL
THEM
NO
AMOUNT
OF
PREVENTION
WILL
BE
COMPLETELY
SUCCESSFUL
FORGET
THE
FINGERNAIL
POLISH
I
HAVE
FINALLY
SETTLED
UPON
A
TREATMENT
THAT
INVOLVES
TOPICAL
APPLICATION
OF
A
COMBINATION
OF
CORTISONE
CREME
REDUCES
THE
INFLAMATION
AND
SWELLING
AND
BENZOCAINE
RELIEVES
THE
ITCH
I
WONT
TELL
YOU
ALL
THE
THINGS
IVE
TRIED
NOR
WILL
I
TELL
YOU
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
MY
WIFE
DOES
SINCE
THIS
COUNTS
AS
MINOR
SURGERY
AND
IS
BEST
NOT
MENTIONED
I
ALSO
THINK
IT
GAINS
NOTHING
THE
SWELLING
AND
ITCHING
CAN
ALSO
BE
SIGNIFICANTLY
RELIEVED
BY
THE
APPLICATION
OF
HOT
PACKS
AND
THIS
SEEMS
TO
SPEED
RECOVERY
AS
WELL
DOCTORS
SEEM
NOT
TO
CARE
MUCH
ABOUT
CHIGGERS
THE
URBAN
AND
SUBURBAN
DOCTORS
APPARENTLY
DONT
ENCOUNTER
THEM
MUCH
AND
THE
RURAL
DOCTORS
SEEM
TO
REGARD
THEM
AS
A
FORCE
OF
NATURE
THAT
ONE
MUST
ENDURE
I
SUSPECT
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
COULD
COME
UP
WITH
A
GOOD
TREATMENT
FOR
CHIGGERS
WOULD
MAKE
A
LOT
