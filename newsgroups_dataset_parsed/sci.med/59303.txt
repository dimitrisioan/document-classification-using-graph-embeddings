WRITES
AS
FOR
HOW
FOODS
TASTE
IF
IM
NOT
ALLERGIC
TO
MSG
AND
I
LIKE
THE
TASTE
OF
IT
WHY
SHOULDNT
I
USE
IT
SAYING
I
SHOULDNT
USE
IT
IS
LIKE
SAYING
I
SHOULDNT
EAT
SPICY
FOOD
BECAUSE
MY
NEIGHBOR
HAS
AN
ULCER
JULIE
IT
DOESNT
NECESSARILY
FOLLOW
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
USE
IT
MSG
OR
SOMETHING
ELSE
FOR
THAT
MATTER
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
YOU
ARE
NOT
ALLERGIC
TO
IT
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
MIGHT
NOT
BE
ALLERGIC
TO
ANIMAL
FATS
AND
LIKE
THEIR
TASTE
YET
IT
DOESNT
FOLLOW
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
USING
THEM
REGULARLY
MSG
MIGHT
HAVE
OTHER
BAD
OR
GOOD
I
AM
NOT
UP
ON
KNOWLEDGE
OF
MSG
EFFECTS
ON
YOUR
BODY
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
MAYBE
THATS
REASON
ENOUGH
NOT
TO
USE
IT
PERHAPS
I
SHOULD
QUIT
EATING
MUSHROOMS
SOYA
BEANS
AND
BRIE
CHEESE
WHICH
ALL
HAVE
MSG
IN
THEM
IT
OCCURS
NATURALLY
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
QUIT
EATING
SOMETHING
THAT
I
LIKE
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
MIGHT
CAUSE
ME
TROUBLE
LATER
OR
CAUSES
PROBLEMS
IN
SOME
PEOPLE
I
WOULD
MUCH
RATHER
AVOID
STRESS
BY
NOT
WORRYING
OVER
WHAT
GOES
IN
MY
MOUTH
AND
NOT
SPENDING
EVERY
DAY
READING
CONFLICTING
REPORTS
OF
WHAT
IS
GOODBAD
FOR
YOU
I
MAY
EAT
SOME
THINGS
IN
QUANTITIES
THAT
MAY
NOT
BE
GOOD
FOR
ME
FINE
IVE
MADE
MY
DECISION
AND
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
APPROPRIATE
FOR
ANYONE
TO
TRY
TO
CONVERT
ME
ITS
FOR
YOUR
OWN
GOOD
ARE
THE
MOST
OBNOXIOUS
AND
HARMFUL
WORDS
IMO
IN
THE
ENGLISH
OR
ANY
OTHER
LANGUAGE
ALTHO
YOUR
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
ULCER
IS
FUNNY
IT
ISNT
AN
APPROPRIATE
COMPARISON
AT
ALL
I
THINK
IT
IS
I
GET
TIRED
OF
PEOPLE
SAYING
DONT
EAT
X
BECAUSE
ITS
BAD
WELL
X
MAY
NOT
BE
BAD
FOR
EVERYONE
AND
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
SO
WHAT
GIVE
PEOPLE
ALL
THE
INFORMATION
BUT
DONT
RAM
YOUR
DECISIONS
DOWN

THROATS
