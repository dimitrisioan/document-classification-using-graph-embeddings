MY
EXPERIENCE
GEORGE
PAAP
IVE
GOT
A
VERY
NICE
COLLECTION
OF
HISTORICAL
BOOKS
ON
MEDICAL
QUACKERY
AND
ON
THE
TOPIC
OF
MASSAGE
THIS
IS
A
RECURRING
THEME
ORDINARY
MASSAGE
IS
INTENDED
TO
MAKE
A
PERSON
FEEL
BETTER
ESPECIALLY
IF
THEY
HAVE
MUSCULAR
OR
JOINT
PROBLEMS
BUT
LIKE
CHIROPRACTY
THERE
ARE
SOME
PRACTITIONERS
WHO
TAKE
THE
TECHNIQUE
TO
A
FAR
EXTREME
INVOKING
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
QUACK
SCIENCE
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
TECHNIQUE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
MASSAGE
THERE
IS
A
TECHNIQUE
CALLED
DEEP
ABDOMINAL
MASSAGE
IN
WHICH
THE
MASSEUR
IS
LITERALLY
ATTEMPTING
TO
MASSAGE
THE
INTESTINES
THE
NOTION
IS
THAT
UNDIGESTED
FOOD
ADHERES
TO
THE
INNER
SURFACE
OF
THE
INTESTINES
AND
PUTRIFIES
RELEASING
POISONS
WHICH
CAUSE
VARIOUS
DISEASE
SYNDROMES
BY
THIS
VIGOROUS
AND
PAINFUL
PROCEDURE
IT
IS
ALLEGED
THAT
THESE
DEPOSITS
CAN
BE
LOOSENED
UP
AND
PASSED
OUT
I
JUST
CANT
BELIEVE
THIS
IDEA
HAS
ANY
TRUTH
BEHIND
IT
THE
HUMAN
INTESTINE
IS
NOT
A
NEW
YORK
CITY
SEWER
PIPE
AND
EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
YOU
EAT
HALF
OF
A
SMALL
BOX
OF
TRISCUITS
AND
THERE
AINT
GONNA
BE
NOTHIN
STICKING
TO
THE
INNER
SURFACE
OF
YOUR
INTESTINE
MARK
THIS
IS
THE
MOST
REASONABLE
POST
THAT
IVE
SEEN
IN
SCI
MED
ON
THE
TOPIC
OF
COLONIC
FLUSHING
IM
IN
A
PROFESSION
THAT
USES
MANIPULATIONA
VERY
REFINED
FORM
OF
MASSAGE
TO
TREAT
VARIOUS
HUMAN
DISEASES
PROVING
THAT
MANIPULATION
WORKS
HAS
BEEN
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULTAS
THE

DELIGHT
IN
POINTING
OUT
THE
OSTEOPATHIC
PROFESSION
SEEMS
TO
BE
MAKING
BETTER
PROGRESS
THAN
THE
CHIROPRACTORS
IN
PROVINGSCIENTIFICALLY
THAT
THEIR
TECHINGUES
WORK
THE

RECENTLY
HAD
A
STUDY
ON
THE
USE
OF
MANIPULATION
TO
RELIEVE
MENSRUAL
CRAMPS
IN
WOMEN
WITH
RESULTS
THAT
WERE
AS
GOOD
OR
BETTER
THAN

TREATMENTUSING
PHYSIOLOGICAL

AND
NOT

THE
WOMANS
PRECEPTION
OF
IMPROVEMENT
THIS
STUDY
WAS
HAILED
BY
THE

EDITORS
AS
THE
TURNING
POINT
IN

HAS

POINTED
OUT
IN
A

PROPOSAL
THAT
THE
FOUNDER
OF
OSTEOPATHIC
MEDICINEAT
STILL
EMBRACED
BOTH
DIET
AND
MANIPULATION
TO
SET
HIMSELF
APART
FROM
THE
MDS
OF
HIS
TIME
WHO
WERE
PUSHING
ONLY
DRUGSSTILL
WAS
HIMSELF
AN
MD
WHO
GOT
REAL
DISSILLUSIONED
WITH
DRUGS
DURING
HIS
SERVICE
IN
THE
CIVIL
WAR
HE
DECIDED
THAT
THERE
HAD
TO
BE
A
BETTER
WAY
TO
TREAT
HUMAN
DISEASE
SINCE
HE
SAW
THE
CUREDRUGS
AS
BEING
WORSE
THAN
THE
DISEASE
THROUGH
HIS
MANY
YEARS
OF
STUDY
OF
THE
HUMAN
BODY
HE
DEVELOPED
HIS
MANIPULATION
TECHNIQUES
THAT
HE
THEN
TAUGHT
TO
HIS
STUDENTS
IN
THE

FIRST
OSTEOPATHIC
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
WE
NOW
HAVE
STILL
USED
MANIPULATION
TO
TREATAND
ALSO
DIAGNOSE
HUMAN
DISEASE
BUT
HE
USED
DIET
TO
PREVENT
HUMAN
DISEASE
IM
TRYING
TO
GET
THE
OSTEOPATHIC
PROFESSION
TO
RETURN
TO
ITS
ROOTS
AND
BEAT
THE
MDS
TO
THE
PUNCHSO
TO
SPEAK
BOTH
DOS
AND
MDS
IN
CURRENT

HAVE
VERY
