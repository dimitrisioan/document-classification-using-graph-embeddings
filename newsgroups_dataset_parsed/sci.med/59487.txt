re
help
for
kidney
stones
as
i
recall
from
my
bout
with
kidney
stones
there
isnt
any
medication
that
can
do
anything
about
them
except
relieve
the
pain
either
they
pass
or
they
have
to
be
broken
up
with
sound
or
they
have
to
be
extracted
surgically
when
i
was
in
the
xray
tech
happened
to
mention
that
shed
had
kidney
stones
and
children
and
the
childbirth
hurt
less
demerol
worked
although
i
nearly
got
arrested
on
my
way
home
when
i
barfed
all
over
the
police
car
parked
just
outside
the
er
brian
