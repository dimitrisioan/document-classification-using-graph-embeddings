I
DONT
DOUBT
THAT
THE
PLACEBO
EFFECT
IS
ALIVE
AND
WELL
WITH
T

EVERY
MEDICAL
MODALITY
ESTIMATED
BY
SOME
TO

WHY
WOULD
IT
BE
HIGHER

HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
IT
IS
IF
YOU
COULD
SHOW
THIS

YOU

RUSSELL
IF
YOU
NOTICE
THE
QUESTION
MARK
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SENTENCE
I
WAS
ADDRESSING
THAT
VERY
QUESTION
TO
THAT
PERSON
WHO
HAS
A
DOG
NAMED
SUGAR
AND
A
FEW
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHO
SEEM
TO
BE
OF
THE
SAME
OPINION
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HAVE
ANYONE
COME
UP
WITH
A
STUDY
TO
SUPPORT
THEIR
CLAIMS
THAT
THE
PLACEBO
EFFECT
IS
MORE
PREVALENT
WITH
ALTERNATIVE
COMPARED
TO
CONVENTIONAL
MEDICINE
PERHAPS
THE
STUDY
COULD
ALSO
INCLUDE
HOW
PATIENTS
RESPOND
IF
THEY
ARE
DISSATISFIED
WITH
A
CONVENTIONAL
VERSUS
AN
ALTERNATIVE

WHICH
PRACTITIONER
IS
MORE

GET
PUNCHED

THE
SUCCESS
OF
THE
TREATMENT
DOESNT
MEET

EXPECTATIONS
OF
