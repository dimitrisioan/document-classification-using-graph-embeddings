ANOTHER
UNCOMMON
PROBLEM
IS
MATERNAL
HEMORRHAGE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE
INCIDENCE
BUT
IT
IS
SOMETHING
LIKE
IN
OR
BIRTHS
IT
IS
HARD
TO
SEE
HOW
YOU
COULD
HANDLE
IT
AT
HOME
AND
YOU
WOULDNT
HAVE
VERY
MUCH
TIME
THING
YOU
MIGHT
CONSIDER
IS
THAT
PEOPLES
RISK
TRADEOFFS
VARY
I
CONSIDER
A
RISK
OF
LOSS
OF
A
LOVED
ONE
TO
REQUIRE
CONSIDERABLE
EFFORT
IN
THE
AVOIDING
MARK
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
TERRIFIED
OF
THE
BIRTH
PROCESS
THATS
RIDICULOUS
AND
UNABLE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
WOMENS
BODIES
ARE
ACTUALLY
DESIGNED
TO
DO
IT
THEY
ARENT
DESIGNED
THEY
EVOLVED
AND
MUCH
AS
IT
DISCOMFORTS
US
IN
HUMANS
A
TROUBLEFREE
BIRTH
PROCESS
WAS
SACRIFICED
TO
INCREASED
BRAIN
AND
CRANIAL
SIZE
WILD
ANIMALS
HAVE
A
MUCH
EASIER
TIME
WITH
BIRTH
THAN
HUMANS
DO
DOMESTIC
HORSES
AND
COWS
TYPICALLY
HAVE
A
WORSE
TIME
TO
GIVE
YOU
AN
IDEA
MY
FAMILY
TREE
IS
COMPLICATED
BECAUSE
A
FEW
OF
MY
PIONEER
GREATGREAT
GRANDFATHERS
HAD
SEVERAL
WIVES
AND
WE
NEVER
COULD
FIGURE
OUT
WHICH
WIFE
HAD
EACH
CHILD
ONE
MIGHT
ASK
WHY
THIS
HAPPENED
MY
GREATGREAT
GRANDFATHERS
WERE
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
REACHED
THEIR
FORTIES
QUITE
PROSPEROUS
FARMERS
NONETHELESS
THEY
LOST
SEVERAL
WIVES
EACH
TO
THE
RIGORS
OF
CHILDBIRTH
THE
GRAVEYARDS
IN
SPENCER
INDIANA
AND
BOSWELL

BABIES
GET
HUNG
UP
IN

MORE
LIKE
ONE
IN

AND
THE
CONSEQUENCES
CAN
BE
DEVASTATING
I
HAVE
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
OF
MORE
THAN
A
DOZEN
VICTIMS
OF
A
FOULEDUP
BREECH
BIRTH
AND
NOW
YOU
WANT
ALL
BABIES
BORN
IN
HOSPITAL
BASED
ON
A
GUESS
OF
HOW
LIKELY
MATERNAL
HEMORRHAGE
IS
AND
A
FALSE
BELIEF
THAT
IT
IS
FATAL
IT
ISNT
ALWAYS
FATAL
BUT
IT
IS
OFTEN
FATAL
WHEN
IT
HAPPENS

AM
NO
BELIEVER
IN
DIVINE
DESIGN
HOWEVER
EVOLUTION
DID
NOT
FAVOR
TROUBLEFREE

YOU

ALTHOUGH
I
CANT

AFTER
THE
LAST
TIME
WE
LOOKED
THEM
UP

ASSURED
THAT
WE
BALANCED
CSECTION

I
WOULDNT
ENCOURAGE
MY

TO
HAVE
A
CAESAREAN
UNLESS
IT
WAS
CLEARLY
INDICATED
ON
THE

I
AM
OPPOSED
ON
OBVIOUS
GROUNDS

WAITING
UNTIL
AN
EMERGENCY
TO
GIVE
IN
AND
BEAR
THIS
IN

MY

TOOK
THE
LEAD
IN
ALL
OF
THESE
DECISIONS
WE
TALKED
THINGS
OVER
AND
I
DID
A
LOT
OF
THE
LEG
WORK
BUT
THE
MAIN
DECISIONS
WERE
REALLY
HERS
BUT
I
FOR
ONE
AM
BOTHERED
BY
YOUR
CONTINUED
SUGGESTIONS
ESPECIALLY
TO
THE
MISCKIDDERS
PREGNANT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THAT
BIRTH
IS
DANGEROUS
EVEN
FATAL
AND
THAT
ALL
THESE
UNPLEASANT
THINGS
ARE
FAR
BETTER
THAN
THE
RISKS
YOU
RUN
JUST
DOING
IT
NATURALLY
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
VERY
MANY

THAT

BIRTH
THIS
TIME
BUT
FOR
HEAVENS
SAKE
NOT
EVERYONE
NEEDS
THAT
BUT
PEOPLE
SHOULD
BOTHER
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
RELATIVE
RISKS
MY

WAS
UNWILLING
TO
TAKE
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
RISKS
IN

TO
HAVE
NICE
SURROUNDINGS
IN

OF
THE
INTENSITY
