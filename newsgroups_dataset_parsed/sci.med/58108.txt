WRITES
I
THINK
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
VERIFY
ALL
PROCEDURES
WITH
PROPER
STUDIES
TO
SHOW
THEIR
WORTHINESS
AND
RISK
I
JUST
READ
AN
INTERESTING
TIDBIT
THAT
OF
THE
MEDICAL
TREATMENTS
ARE
UNPROVEN
AND
NOT
BASED
ON
SCIENTIFIC
FACT
FOR
EXAMPLE
MANY
TREATMENTS
OF
PROSTATE
CANCER
ARE
UNPROVEN
AND
THE
TREATMENT
MAY
BE
MORE
DANGEROUS
THAN
THE
DISEASE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
ARTICLE
I
READ
WHERE
DID
YOU
READ
THIS
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
TRUE
I
THINK
MOST
MEDICAL
TREATMENTS
ARE
BASED
ON
SCIENCE
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
PROVE
ANYTHING
WITH
CERTITUDE
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
THINGS
THAT
HAVE
JUST
BEEN
FOUND
TO
WORK
BUT
WE
HAVE
NO
GOOD
EXPLANATION
FOR
WHY
BUT
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
DOES
HAVE
A
SCIENTIFIC
RATIONALE
THE
MOST
COMMON
TREATMENT
FOR
PROSTATE
CANCER
IS
PROBABLY
HORMONE
THERAPY
IT
HAS
BEEN
PROVEN
TO
WORK
SO
HAVE
RADIATION
AND
CHEMOTHERAPY
WHAT
TREATMENTS
DID
THE
ARTICLE
SAY
ARE
NOT
PROVEN

SKEPTICISM

IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER

SOON
