GORDON
BANKS
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
FOR
A
RESIDENCY
TO
DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST
FMGS
IS
THAT
TRUE
I
KNOW
SOME
THAT
WONT
EVEN
INTERVIEW
FMGS
I
THINK
A
CASE
COULD
BE
MADE
THAT
THIS
IS
DISCRIMINATORY
PARTICULARLY
IF
AN
APPLICANT
HAD
GOOD
BOARD
SCORES
AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
BUT
WASNT
OFFERED
AN
INTERVIEW
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
HAS
EVER
GONE
TO
COURT
