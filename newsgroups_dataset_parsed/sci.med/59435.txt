CURRENT
DRUG

THIS
IS
ATTRIBUTABLE
DR
ROSS
BELIEVES
TO
THE
THEORY
THAT
ALZHEIMERS
IS
CAUSED
BY
AN
INTERRUPTION
IN
THE
TRANSMISSION
OF
THE
CHEMICAL
ACETYLCHOLINE
TO
THE

THIS
BELIEF

BEEN
ADHERED

CONSEQUENTLY
MOST
DRUGS

TREAT
ALZHEIMERS
WERE
BASED
ON
THE
CHANGING
RECEPTORS
FOR
ACETYLCHOLINE
PHYSICIANS
HAVE
A
REAL
NEED
FOR
A
TEST
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
ALZHEIMERS
FROM
OTHER
DEMENTIAS
TO
PROVIDE
THE
PATIENT
AND
HIS
OR
HER
FAMILY
WITH
A
FIRM
DIAGNOSIS

TO
MONITOR
FUTURE
TREATMENT
PROTOCOLS
FOR
THE
TREATMENT
OF
THIS
DISEASE
FOR
THIS
REASON
WE
CONSIDER
THIS

AN
INCURABLE
DEGENERATIVE
DISEASE
OF
THE
BRAIN
FIRST
DESCRIBED
IN
BY
THE
GERMAN
NEUROPATHOLOGIST
ALOIS
ALZHEIMER
AS
THE
DISEASE
PROGRESSES
IT
LEADS
TO
LOSS
OF
MEMORY
AND
MENTAL
FUNCTIONING
FOLLOWED
BY
CHANGES
IN

LOSS
OF
CONTROL

AND
EVENTUALLY
DEATH
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
DOES
IT
AFFECT
ALZHEIMERS
DISEASE
AFFECTS
AN
ESTIMATED
MILLION
ADULTS
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
IS
THE
FOURTH
LEADING
CAUSE
OF
DEATH
TAKING
APPROXIMATELY
LIVES
EACH
YEAR
WHILE
ALZHEIMERS
DEBILITATES
ITS
VICTIMS
IT
IS
EQUALLY
DEVASTATING
BOTH
EMOTIONALLY
AND
FINANCIALLY
FOR
PATIENTS
FAMILIES
AD

THE
MOST
COMMON
CAUSE
OF
DEMENTIA
IN

WITHIN
YEARS
OF
INITIAL
ONSET
WHAT
ARE
ITS
SIGNS
AND
SYMPTOMS
ALTHOUGH
THE
CAUSE
OF
AD
IS
NOT
KNOWN
TWO
RISK
FACTORS
HAVE
BEEN
IDENTIFIED

AGE
AND
GENETIC
PREDISPOSITION
THE
RISK
OF
DEVELOPING

IS
LESS
THAN
ONE
PERCENT
BEFORE
THE
AGE
OF

BUT
INCREASES
STEEPLY
IN

FORGETFULNESS

DR
HERMAN
WEINREB
OF
THE

AT

UNIVERSITY
SAYS
WHETHER
FORGETFULNESS
IS
A
SERIOUS
SYMPTOM
OR
NOT
IS
LARGELY
A
MATTER
OF
DEGREE
AND
SUGGESTS
THE
FOLLOWING
CRITERIA
FORGETTING
THE

OF
SOMEONE
YOU
SEE
INFREQUENTLY
IS
NORMAL
FORGETTING
THE

OF
A
LOVED
ONE
IS
SERIOUS
FORGETTING

KEYS
IS
NORMAL
FORGETTING
HOW
TO
GET
HOME
IS
SERIOUS
DOCTORS
SUGGEST
THAT
PEOPLE
WITH
SEVERE
SYMPTOMS
SHOULD
BE
EVALUATED
