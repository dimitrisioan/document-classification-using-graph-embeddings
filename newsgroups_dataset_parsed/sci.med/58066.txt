EMPHYSEMA
QUESTION
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IS
GOING
IN
LATER
THIS
WEEK
FOR
TESTS
TO
SEE
IF
HAS
EMPHYSEMA
HIS
LUNG
CAPACITY
HAS
DECREASED
OVER
TIME
HIS
FATHER
DIED
OF
THE
DISEASE
HE
WORKS
IN
WOODWORKING
I
BELIEVE
HE
HAS
A
VERY
OCCASIONAL
CIGARETTE
PERHAPS
ONE
CIGARETTE
A
DAY
OR
EVEN
LESS
HE
TELLS
ME
THISIVE
NEVER
SEEN
HIM
LIGHT
UP
HE
HAS
SOME
PRETTY
HEALTHY
LIFE
STYLE
HABITS
GOOD
DIET
EXERCISE
MEDITATION
RETREATS
THERAPY
ETC
ANYHOWHE
IS
VERY
CONCERNED
WITH
THIS
CHECK
UP
I
KNOW
REALLY
NOTHING
ABOUT
THE
DISEASE
I
BELIEVE
IT
INTERFERES
WITH
THE
LINING
OF
THE
LUNG
BEING
ABLE
TO
EXCHANGE
OXYGEN
IS
A
DIAGNOSIS
OF
EMPHYSEMA
A
DEATH
SENTENCE
IF
HE
WERE
TO
GIVE
UP
SMOKING
ENTIRELY
WOULD
THAT
BETTER
HIS
CHANCES
FOR
RECOVERY
WHAT
ARE
SOME
MODERN
THERAPIES
USED
IN
PEOPLE
WITH
THIS
DISEASE
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
INFORMATION
THANKS
