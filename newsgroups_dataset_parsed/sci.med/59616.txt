HOWARD
R
DOYLE
WRITES
BEING
A
CHRONIC
HBSAG
CARRIER
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
THE
PATIENT
HAS
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
ANYTHING
PERSONS
WHO
ARE
CHRONIC
CARRIERS
MAY
HAVE
NO
CLINICAL
BIOCHEMICAL
OR
HISTOLOGIC
EVIDENCE
OF
LIVER
DISEASE
OR
THEY
MAY
HAVE
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
CIRRHOSIS
OR
HEPATOCELLULAR
CARCINOMA
MOST
CASES
OF
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
CPH
ARE
PROBABLY
THE
RESULT
OF
A
VIRAL
INFECTION
ALTHOUGH
IN
A
GOOD
NUMBER
OF
CASES
THE
CAUSE
CANNOT
BE
DETERMINED
THE
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CPH
IS
MADE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
LIVER
BIOPSY
IT
CONSISTS
OF
FINDINGS
OF
PORTAL
INFLAMMATION
AN
INTACT
PERIPORTAL
LIMITING
PLATE
AND
ON
OCCASION
ISOLATED
FOCI
OF
INTRALOBULAR
NECROSIS
BUT
IN
CONTRAST
TO
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
CAH
THERE
IS
NO
PERIPORTAL
INFLAMMATION
BRIDGING
NECROSIS
OR
FIBROSIS
CPH
HAS
INDEED
AN
EXCELLENT
PROGNOSIS
IF
I
HAD
TO
CHOOSE
BETWEEN
CAH
AND
CPH
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
I
WOULD
ALSO
CHOOSE
CPH
HOWEVER
AS
DAVID
POINTED
OUT
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
IS
NOT
AS
NEAT
AS
SOME
OF
US
WOULD
HAVE
IT
THE
HISTOLOGY
CAN
SOMETIMES
BE
PRETTY
EQUIVOCAL
WITH
BIOPSIES
SHOWING
AREAS
COMPATIBLE
WITH
BOTH
CPH
AND
CAH
MAYBE
IT
IS
A
SAMPLING
PROBLEM
MAYBE
IT
IS
A
CONTINUUM
I
DONT
KNOW
DARN
JUST
WHEN
I
THINK
I
UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING
SOMEONE
WHO
KNOWS
THE
PATHOLOGY
HAS
TO
BURST
MY
BUBBLE
WED
BETTER
NOT
START
TALKING
ABOUT
GLOMERULAR
DISEASES
THEN
ILL
REALLY
GET
DEPRESSED
SERIOUSLY
THOUGH
I
WONDER
HOW
SOMEONE
WITH
CPH
WOULD
END
UP
GETTING
A
BIOPSY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
MY
UNDERSTANDING
AND
FEEL
FREE
TO
CORRECT
ME
IS
THAT
THE
ENZYMES
ARE
AT
WORST
MILDLY
ELEVATED
WITH
OVERALL
NORMAL
HEPATIC
FUNCTION
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THE
ONLY
CLUE
MIGHT
BE
A
HISTORY
OF
PRIOR
HEPB
INFECTION
AND
A
POSITIVE
HEPBSAG
OR
IS
IT
INDEED
ON
A
CONTINUUM
WITH
CAH
AND
THE
DISTINCTION
MERELY
ONE
OF
PATHOLOGY
AND
PROGNOSIS
BUT
OTHERWISE
IDENTICAL
CLINICAL
FEATURES
