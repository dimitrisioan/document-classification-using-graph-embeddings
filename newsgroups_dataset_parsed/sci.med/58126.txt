is
there
any
way
around
the
scheduled
drug
mess
so
that
he
can
use
just
the
substance
that
works
and
not
one
adulterated
with
tylenol
can
the
md
perscribe
a
year
long
supply
on
one
script
his
doctor
basically
refused
to
prescribe
it
saying
his
clinic
does
not
prescribe
controled
substances
its
is
company
rule
short
of
changes
by
the
feds
there
is
no
way
codeine
alone
is
very
difficult
to
prescribe
without
a
lot
of
hassles
tylenol
is
the
best
compromise
that
way
he
can
get
refills
the
amount
of
acetominophen
he
is
getting
with
his
codeine
wont
hurt
him
any
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and

it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
