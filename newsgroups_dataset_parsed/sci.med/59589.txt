WRITES
I
AM
NEITHER
A
REAL
BELIEVER
NOR
A
DISBELIEVER
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
SOCALLED
PARANORMAL
STUFF
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
IM
CONCERNED
IT
IS
JUST
AS
LIKELY
AS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
FOR
INSTANCE
A
GOD
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
QUITE
ACCEPTED
IN
OUR
SOCIETIES
WITHOUT
ANY
SCIENTIFIC
BASIS
BUT
NO
ONE
OR
AT
LEAST
NOT
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
TRYING
TO
PASS
OFF
GOD
AS
A
SCIENTIFIC
FACT
NOT
SO
WITH
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
ILL
ADMIT
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
SOME
SUPERIOR
INTELLIGENCE
EXISTS
ELSEWHERE
AND
IF
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
LABEL
THAT
INTELLIGENCE
GOD
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
STOP
THEM
ANYWAY
LETS
NOT
TURN
THIS
INTO
A
THEOLOGICAL
DEBATE
I
AM
CONVINCED
THAT
IT
IS
A
SERIOUS
MISTAKE
TO
CLOSE
YOUR
MIND
TO
SOMETHING
ANYTHING
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IT
DOESNT
FIT
YOUR
CURRENT
FRAME
OF
REFERENCE
HISTORY
SHOWS
THAT
MANY
GREAT
PEOPLE
GREAT
SCIENTISTS
WERE
PEOPLE
WHO
KEPT
AN
OPEN
MIND
AND
WERE
RIDICULED
BY
SCEPTICS
