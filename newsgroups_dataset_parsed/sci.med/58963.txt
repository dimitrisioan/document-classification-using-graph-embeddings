MARK
FULK
WRITES
IM
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
HISTORY
OF
THIS
EXPERIMENT
ALTHOUGH
ARGUABLY
I
SHOULD
BE
FOR
A
BRIEF
BUT
PRETTY
DETAILED
ACCOUNT
TRY
HEMPELS
PHILOSOPHY
OF
NATURAL
SCIENCE
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
ENOUGH
IF
HIS
CONTEMPORARIES
FOUND
THE
RESULT
SURPRISING
THATS
NOT
WHAT
ID
QUIBBLE
ABOUT
WHAT
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
ARE
TORICELLIS
REASONS
FOR
DOING
HIS
EXPERIMENT
NOT
THE
POST
HOC
CONSTRUCTED
REASONS
BUT
THE
THOUGHTS
IN
HIS
HEAD
AS
HE
CONSIDERED
THE
PROBLEM
IT
MAY
BE
THIS
SMACKS
A
BIT
OF
IDEOLOGY
THE
SUPPOSITION
BEING
THAT
TORICELLIS
SUBSEQUENT
DESCRIPTIONS
OF
HIS
REASONING
ARE
NOT
VERIDICAL
IT
GETS
DANGEROUSLY
CLOSE
TO
AN
UNFALSIFIABLE
VIEW
OF
THE
HISTORY
AND
METHODOLOGY
OF
SCIENCE
IF
WE
DENY
THAT
NO
SUBSEQUENT
REPORTS
OF
EXPERIMENTERS
ARE
RELIABLE
DESCRIPTIONS
OF
THEIR
REAL
REASONS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
TORICELLIS
THOUGHTS
THATS
TOO
BAD
IF
IT
IS
SO
ONE
OF
ROOTBERNSTEINS
SERVICES
TO
SCIENCE
IS
THAT
HE
HAS
GONE
ROOTING
ABOUT
IN
PASTEURS
AND
FLEMINGS
AND
OTHER
PEOPLES
NOTES
AND
HAS
DISCOVERED
SOME
SURPRISING
CLUES
ABOUT
THEIR
MOTIVATIONS
PASTEUR
NEVER
PUBLICLY
ADMITTED
HIS
PLAN
TO
CREATE
MIRRORIMAGE
LIFE
BUT
THE
DREAMS
ARE
RIGHT
THERE
IN
HIS
NOTEBOOKS
FINALLY
PUBLIC
AFTER
MANY
YEARS
READY
FOR
ANYONE
TO
READ
AND
I
AND
MY
FRIENDS
OFTEN
HAVE
THE
MOST
RIDICULOUS
REASONS
FOR
PURSUING
RESULTS
ONE
OF
MY
BEST
CAME
BECAUSE
I
WAS
MAD
AT
A
COLLEAGUE
FOR
A
POORLYWRITTEN
CLAIM
I
DISPROVED
THE
CLAIM
OF
COURSE
TORICELLIS
CASE
MAY
BE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
RARETY
WHERE
THE
FANTASY
NOT
ONLY
MOTIVATES
THE
EXPERIMENT
BUT
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
RIGHT
IN
THE
END
BUT
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
THIS
TYPE
OF
CASE
IS
NOT
A
RARITY
IN
FACT
I
WAS
GOING
TO
POINT
TO
PASTEUR
AS
YET
ANOTHER
RATHER
COMMON
EXAMPLE
PARTICULARLY
THE
STUDIES
ON
SPONTANEOUS
GENERATION
AND
FERMENTATION
I
WILL
READILY
CONCEDE
THAT
RIDICULOUS
REASONS
CAN
PLAY
AN
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
HOW
SCIENTISTS
SPEND
THEIR
TIME
BUT
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
CONFUSE
MOTIVATION
WITH
METHODOLOGY
NOR
SUPPOSE
THAT
RIDICULOUS
REASONS
PROVIDE
THE
IMPETUS
IN
THE
MAJORITY
OF
CASES

ON
RELATIVELY
INFREQUENT
