re
barbecued
foods
and
health
risk
from
my
reading
of
the
popular
and
scientific
literature
i
think
that
the
benzopyrenefromburnedfat
problem
is
probably
real
but
very
small
compared
to
other
kinds
of
risks
this
type
of
problem
also
occurs
with

grilling
one
possible
remedy
i
have
read
about
is
to
take
some
vitamin
c
with
your
meal
of
barbecue
or
bacon
eg
this
may
make
sense
because
vit
c
is
an
antioxidant
which
could
counteract
the
adverse
affect
of
some
of
the
chemicals
in
question
