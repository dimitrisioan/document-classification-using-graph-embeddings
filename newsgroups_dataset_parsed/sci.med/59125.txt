for

and
would
like
to
review
the
product
wordscan

is
a
product
of
calera
recognition
systems
it
runs
under
windows
and
supports
that
accufont
technology
of
the
hewlett
packard
scanners
when
initially
bringing
up
the
software
it
lets
you
select
several

of

i
like
manual
decomposition
since
the

then
lets
me
select
which
parts
of
the
document
i
would
like
scanned
and
in
what
order
once
an
image
is
scanned
you
can
bring
up
the
popup
image
verification
the
software
gives
you
two
errors
at
this
point

are

but
do
not
match
anything
in
the
builtin
dictionary
yellow
shade
which
are
words
that
wordscan
plus
doesnt
think
it
converted
correctly
at
all
i
have
found
that
the
software
should
give
itself
more
credit
it
is
usually
correct
instead
of
wrong
if
a
word
is
shaded
blue
you
can
add
it
to
your
personal
dictionary
the
only
problem
is
the
personal
dictionary
will
only
handle
about
words
i
find
this
to
be
very
limited
considering
how
many
medical
terms
are
not
in
a
normal
dictionary
after
a
document
is
converted
you
can
save
it
in
a
multitude
of
word
processor
formats
also
any
images
that
were
captured
can
be
stored
in
a
seperate
tiff
or

format
i
was

the

introduction
despite
predictions
earlier
this
century
that
infectious
diseases
would
soon
be
eliminated
as
a
public
health
problem
infectious
diseases
remain
the
major
cause
of
death
worldwide
and
a
leading
cause
of
illness
and
death
in
the
united
states
since
the
early
the
us
public
health
system
has
been
challenged
by
a
myriad
of
newly
identified
pathogens
and
syndromes
eg
escherichia
coli
hepatitis
c
virus
human
immunodeficiency
virus
legionnaires
disease
lyme
disease
and
toxic
shock
syndrome
the
incidences
of
many
diseases
widely
presumed
to
be
under
control
such
as
cholera
malaria
and
tuberculosis
tb
have
increased
in
many
areas
furthermore
control
and
prevention
of
infectious
diseases
are
undermined
by
drug
resistance
in
conditions
such
as
gonorrhea
malaria
pneumococcal
disease
salmonellosis
shigellosis
tb
and
staphylococcal
infections
emerging
infections
place
a
disproportionate
burden
on
immunocompromised
persons
those
in
institutional
settings
eg
hospitals
and
child
day
care
centers
and
minority
and
underserved
populations
the
substantial
economic
burden
of
emerging
infections
on
the
us
healthcare
system
could
be
reduced
by
more
effective
surveillance
systems
and
targeted
control
and
prevention
programs
this
issue
of
mmwr
introduces
a
new
series
emerging
infectious
diseases
future
articles
will
address
these
diseases
as
well
as

gramnegative
bacterium
first
identified
as
a
cause
of
illness
in
during
an
outbreak
of
severe
bloody
diarrhea
traced
to
contaminated
hamburgers
this
pathogen
has
since
emerged
as
an
important
cause
of
both
bloody
diarrhea
and
hus
the
most
common
cause
of
acute
renal
failure
in
children
outbreak
investigations
have
linked
most
cases
with
the
consumption
of
undercooked
ground
beef
although
other
food
vehicles
including
roast
beef
raw
milk
and
apple
cider
also
have
been
implicated
preliminary
data
from
a
cdc
nationwide
multicenter
study
revealed
that
when
stools
were
routinely
cultured
for
e
coli
that
organism
was
isolated
more
frequently
than
shigella
in
four
of
participating
hospitals
and
was
isolated
from
of
all
bloody
stools
a
higher
rate
than
for
any
other
pathogen
infection
with
e

often
is
not
recognized

not

and
many
clinicians
are
unaware
of
the
spectrum
of
illnesses
associated
with
infection
the
usual
clinical
manifestations
are
diarrhea
often
bloody
and
abdominal
cramps
fever
is
infrequent
younger
age
groups
and
the
elderly
are
at
highest
risk
for
clinical
manifestations
and
complications
illness
usually
resolves
after
days
but
of
patients
develop
hus
which
is
characterized
by
hemolytic
anemia
thrombocytopenia
renal
failure
and
a
death
rate
of
this
report
illustrates
the
difficulties
in
recognizing
community
outbreaks
of
e
coli
in
the
absence
of
routine
surveillance
despite
the
magnitude
of
this
outbreak
the
problem
may
not
have
been
recognized
in
three
states
if
the
epidemiologic
link
had
not
been
established
in
washington
clinical
laboratories
should
routinely
culture

persons

points

processing
as
a
component
of
a
program
to
reduce
the
likelihood
of
pathogens
such
as
e
coli
entering
the
meat
supply
because
slaughtering
practices
can
result
in
contamination
of
raw
meat
with
pathogens
and
because
the
process
of
grinding
beef
may
transfer
pathogens
from
the
surface
of
the
meat
to
the
interior
ground
beef
is
likely
to
be
internally
contaminated
the
optimal
food
protection
practice
is
to
cook
ground
beef
thoroughly
until
the

the
