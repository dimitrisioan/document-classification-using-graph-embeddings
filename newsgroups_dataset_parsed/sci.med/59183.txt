THE

THIS

ON

HAS
PROGRESSED
STEVE
DYER
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
EXCHANGING
WORDS
OVER
THE
SAME
TOPIC
IN
SCI
MED
NUTRITION
WHEN
HE
DISPLAYED
HIS
TYPICAL
RESERVE
AND
ATTACKED
A
WOMAN
POSTER
FOR
BEING
TREATED
BY
A
LICENCED
PHYSICIAN
FOR
A
DISEASE
THAT
DID
NOT
EXIST
CALLING
THIS
PHYSICIAN
A
QUACK
WAS
REPREHENSIBLE
STEVE
AND
I
SEE
THAT
YOU
AND
SOME
OF
THE
OTHERS
ARE
DOING
IT
HERE
AS

THEY
ARE
JUST

IN

HYPERCHOLERIC
SYNDROME
HCS
OOPS
THAT
IS
NOT
A
RECOGNIZED
ILLNESS
IN
THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
COMMUNITY
BETTER
NOT
SAY
THAT
SINCE
IT
THEREFORE
MUST
NOT
AND
NEVER
WILL
EXIST
ACTUALLY
IT
IS
FASCINATING
THAT
A
DISPROPORTIONATE
NUMBER
OF
PHYSICIANS
WILL
TYPE
OUT
AS

FOR
THOSE
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
MYERSBRIGGS

JUST
EMAIL
ME
AND
ILL
SEND
A
SUMMARY

TO
YOU
IN
THE
GENERAL
POPULATION
NTS
COMPRISE
ONLY
ABOUT
OF
THE
POPULATION
BUT
AMONG
PHYSICIANS
IT
IS
MUCH
MUCH
HIGHER
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
EXACT
PERCENTAGE
ANY
HELP
HERE
APPERS
ONE
DRIVING
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
AN
NT
ESPECIALLY
AN
NTJ
IS
THEIR
OBVIOUS
CHOLERIC
BEHAVIOR
DRIVER
TYPE
A
ETC
THE
EXTREME
EMOTIONAL
NEED
TO
CONTROL
TO
LEAD
ANDOR
TO
BE
THE
BEST
OR
THE
MOST
COMPETENT
IF
THEY
ARE
ALSO
EXTROVERTED
THEY
ARE
BEST
DESCRIBED
AS
FIELD
MARSHALLS
THIS
TRAIT
IS
VERY
VALUABLE
AND
ESSENTIAL
IN
OUR
SOCIETY
WE
NEED
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
TO
LEAD
TO
STRIVE
TO
OVERCOME
THE
ELEMENTS
TO
SEEK
AND
THIRST
FOR
KNOWLEDGE
TO
RAISE
THE
LEVEL
OF
COMPETENCY
ETC
THE
GREAT
SUCCESSES
IN
SCIENCE
AND
TECHNOLOGY
ARE
IN
LARGE
PART
DUE
TO
THE
VISION
AN
N
TRAIT
AND
SCIENTIFICALLY
MINDED
APPROACH
T
TRAIT
OF
THE
NT
PERSONALITY
OF
COURSE
THE
OTHER
TYPES
AND
TEMPERAMENTS
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
POSITIVE
CONTRIBUTIONS
AS
WELL
HOWEVER
WHEN
THE
NT
PERSON
HAS
SELFIMAGE
CHALLENGES
THE
DARKSIDE
OF
THIS
PERSONALITY
TYPE
USUALLY
COMES
OUT
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
OBVIOUS
TO
ALL
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
IS
A
STRONG
NT
AND
WHO
HAS
NOT
LEARNED
TO
TEMPER
THEIR
TEMPERAMENT
WILL
BE
EXTREMELY
BUSINESSLIKE
LACK
OF
EMPATHY
OR
FEELING
AND
IS
VERY
COMPELLED
TO
HAVE
TOTAL
CONTROL
OVER
THEIR
PATIENT
THE
PATIENT
MUST
BE
OBEDIENT
TO
THEIR
DIAGNOSIS
AND
PRESCRIPTION
WITHOUT
QUESTION
IVE
KNOWN
MANY
MDS
OF
THIS
TEMPERAMENT
AND
SUFFICE
TO
SAY
I
DONT
OBLIGE
THEM
WITH
A
FOLLOWUP
VISIT
NO
MATTER
HOW
COMPETENT
I
THINK
THEY
ARE
AND
THEY
USUALLY
ARE
VERY
COMPETENT
FROM
A
KNOWLEDGE
VIEWPOINT
SINCE
THAT
IS
AN
EXTREME
DRIVE
OF
THEIRS
TO
KNOW
THE
MOST
TO
KNOW
IT
ALL
MAYBE
WE
NEED
MORE
NF
DOCTORS
ENOUGH
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
LETS
MOVE
ON
TO
CANDIDA
BLOOM
LET
ME
TELL
YOU
WHO
THE
QUACKS
REALLY
ARE
THESE
ARE
THE
PHYSICANS
WHO
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
THE
HUMAN
BODY
INTERACTS
WITH
ITS
ENVIRONMENT
AND
HOW
THAT
BALANCE
CAN
BE
ALTERED
BY
DIET
AND
ANTIBIOTICS
COULD
IT
JUST
BE
PROFESSIONAL
JEALOUSY
I
COULDNT
HELP
ELAINE
OR
JON
BUT
SOMEBODY
ELSE
DID
YOUVE
HELPED
ME
ALREADY
BY
YOUR
POST
OF
COURSE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
MISDIAGNOSED
ON
THE
NET
AS
SUFFERING
FROM
ANAL
RETENTIVITIS
BUT
BEING
THE
PHLEGMATIC
I
AM
MAYBE
I
WAS
JUST
A
LITTLE
TOO
HARSH
ON
A
FEW
PEOPLE
MYSELF
IN
PAST
POSTS
LETS
ALL
TRY
TO
RAISE
THE
LEVEL
OF
THIS
DISCUSSION
ABOVE
THE
LEVEL
OF
ANAL
EFFLUENT
HUMANS
HAVE
ALL
KINDS
OF
DIFFERENT
ORGANISMS
LIVING
IN
THE
GI
SYSTEM
MOUTH
STOMACH
SMALL
AND
LARGE
INTESTINE
SINUSES
VAGINA
AND
ON
THE
SKIN
THESE
ARE
NONPATHOGENIC
BECAUSE
THEY
DO
NOT
CAUSE
DISEASE
IN
PEOPLE
UNLESS
THE
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
IS
COMPROMISED
THEY
ARE
ALSO
CALLED
NONPATHOGENS
BECAUSE
UNLIKE
THE
PATHOGENIC
ORGANISMS
THAT
CAUSE
HUMAN
DISEASE
THEY
DO
NOT
PRODUCE
TOXINS
AS
THEY
LIVE
OUT
THEIR
MERRY
EXISTENCE
IN
AND
ON
OUR
BODY
BUT
ANY
OF
THESE
ORGANISMS
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED
PATHOGENIC
IF
IT
MANAGES
TO
TAKE
UP
RESIDENCE
WITHIN
THE
BODY
A
POOR
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
BARRIER
CAN
LET
THIS
HAPPEN
AND
VITAMIN
A
IS
MAINLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
SETTING
UP
THIS
BARRIER
IN
MY
WELLDESCRIBED
SITUATION
IN
PRIOR
POSTS
I
DEFINITELY
WAS
IMMUNE
STRESSED
BLOOD
TESTS
SHOWED
MY
VITAMIN
A
LEVELS
WERE
VERY
LOW
MY
SINUSES
WERE
A
MESS
NO
DOUBT
THE
MUCOSAL
LINING
AND
THE
CILIA
WERE
HEAVILY
DAMAGED
I
ALSO
WAS
ON
ANTIBIOTICS
TIMES
IN
YEARS
IN
THE
END
EVEN
TWO
WEEKS
OF
CEFTIN
DID
NOT
WORK
AND
I
HAD
CONFIRMED
DIAGNOSES
OF
A
CHRONIC
BACTERIAL
INFECTION
OF
THE
SINUSES
VIA
CATSCANS
MUCUS
COLOR
WONT
GET
INTO
THE
DETAILS
AND
OTHER
SYMPTOMS
THREE
VERY
TRADITIONAL
ENTS
MADE
THIS
DIAGNOSIS
I
DID
NOT
HAVE
ANY
CULTURES
DONE
HOWEVER
BECAUSE
OF
THE
DIFFICULTY
OF
DOING
THIS
RIGHT
AND
BECAUSE
MY
OTHER
SYMPTOMS
CLEARLY
SHOWED
A
BACTERIAL
INFECTION
ENOUGH
OF
THIS
BACKGROUND
PROVIDED
TO
HELP
YOU
UNDERSTAND
WHERE
I
WAS
WHEN
I
MAKE
COMMENTS
ABOUT
MY
SPORANOX
ANTIFUNGAL
THERAPY
BELOW
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
I
HAVE
IS
THIS
CAN
FUNGUS
PENETRATE
A
LITTLE
WAY
INTO
POOR
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
TISSUE
MAYBE
VIA
HYPHAE
THUS
CAUSING
SYMPTOMS
WITHOUT
BEING
CONSIDERED
SYSTEMIC
IN
THE
CLASSIC
SENSE
IT
IS
SORT
OF
AN
INBETWEEN
INFECTION
STEVE
GOT
REAL
UPSET
WITH
ELAINES
DOCTOR
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
USING
ANTIFUNGALS
AND
VITAMIN
A
FOR
HER
GI
PROBLEMS
IF
STEVE
REALLY
UNDERSTOOOD
WHAT
VITAMIN
A
DOES
IN
THE
BODY
HE
WOULD
NOTOR
AT
LEAST
SHOULD
NOT
BE
CALLING
ELAINES
DOCTOR
A
QUACK
I
WAS
CONCERNED
TOO
BECAUSE
OF
THE
TOXICITY
OF
VITAMIN
A
MY
DOCTOR
AFTER
MY
BLOOD
TESTS
PUT
ME
ON
IU
OF
VITAMIN
A
FOR
ONE
WEEK
ONLY
THEN
DROPPED
IT
DOWN
TO
IU
FOR
THE
NEXT
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
I
ALSO
RECEIVED
ZINC
AND
OTHER
SUPPLEMENTATION
SINCE
ALL
OF
THESE
INTERRELATE
IN
FAIRLY
COMPLEX
WAYS
AS
MY
DOCTOR
EXPLAINED
HES
ONE
OF
THOSE
EVIL
ORTHOMOLECULAR
SPECIALISTS
I
HAD
A
BLOOD
TEST
THREE
WEEKS
LATER
AND
VITAMIN
A
WAS
NORMAL
HE
THEN
STOPPED
ME
ON
ALL
VITAMIN
A
EXCEPT
FOR
SOME
IN
A
MULTIVITAMIN
SUPPLEMENT
AND
MADE
SURE
THAT
I
MAINTAIN
A
IUDAY
OF
BETA
CAROTENE
CALL
ME
CARROT
FACE
HOPEFULLY
ELAINES
DOCTOR
WILL
TAKE
A
SIMILAR
CAREFUL
APPROACH
AND
TO
ALL
SUPPLEMENTS
IM
EVEN
REEVALUATING
SOME
SUPPLEMENTS
IM
TAKING
FOR
EXAMPLE
NIACIN
IN
FAIRLY
LARGE
DOSAGES
GRAMDAY
WHICH
STEVE
DYER
HAD
GOOD
INFORMATION
ABOUT
ON
SCIMEDNUTRITION
IF
NIACIN
ONLY
HAS
SECONDORDER
IMPROVEMENT
IN
SYMPTOMATIC
RELIEF
OF
MY
SINUS
ALLERGIES
THEN
IT
PROBABLY
IS
NOT
WORTH
TAKING
SUCH
A
LARGE
DOSE
LONGTERM
AND
RISKING
LIVER
DAMAGE
SURVIVES
IF
IT
GETS
ACCESS
TO
A
LOT
OF
GLUCOSE
IT
BLOOMS
AND
OVER
RIDES
THE
OTHER
ORGANISMS
LIVING
WITH
IT
IN
THE
SINUSES
GI
TRACT
OR
VAGINA
IN
THOUGH
I
DO
NOW
BELIEVE
BASED
ON
MY
SUCCESSFUL
THERAPY
WITH
SPORANOX
THAT
I
DEFINITELY
HAD
SOME
EXCESSIVE
GROWTH
OF
FUNGUS
UNKNOWN
SPECIES
IN
MY
SINUSES
I
STILL
WANT
TO
ASK
THE
QUESTION
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
ANY
STUDIES
THAT
DEMONSTRATE
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IN
THE
SINUSES
WITH
ASSOCIATED
SINUS
IRRITATION
SINUSITISRHINITIS
MY
SINUS
IRRITATION
REDUCED
SIGNIFICANTLY
AFTER
ONE
WEEK
OF
SPORANOX
AND
NO
OTHER
NEW
TREATMENTS
WERE
IMPLEMENTED
DURING
THIS
TIME
I
DID
NOT
HAVE
ANY
NOTICEABLE
GI
TRACK
PROBLEMS
BEFORE
STARTING
ON
SPORANOX
BUT
SOME
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
AFTER
WHICH
THEN
WENT
AWAY
CONSIDERED
NORMAL
BTW
MY
DOCTOR
DUG
OUT
ONE
OF
HIS
MEDICAL
REFERENCE
BOOKS
SORRY
CANT
REMEMBER
WHICH
ONE
AND
FOUND
AN
OBSCURE
COMMENT
DATING
BACK
INTO
THE
WHICH
STATED
THAT
PEOPLE
CAN
DEVELOP
CONTAINED
NONLETHAL
OR
NONSERIOUS
ASPERGILLIS
INFESTATIONS
ASPERGILIOSIS
OF
THE
SINUSES
LEADING
TO
SINUS
INFLAMMATION
SYMPTOMS
ILL
HAVE
TO
DIG
OUT
THAT
REFERENCE
AGAIN
SINCE
IT
IS
RELEVANT
TO
THIS
DISCUSSION
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
REALLY
DEVELOP
A
BAD
INFLAMMATORY
PROCESS
AT
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
OR
SKIN
BLOOM
SITE
WHETHER
THIS
IS
AN
ALLERGIC
LIKE
REACTION
TO
THE
CANDIDA
OR
NOT
ISNT
CERTAIN
MY
DOCTOR
TESTED
ME
I
BELIEVE
A
RAST
OR
RAST
SIMILAR
TEST
FOR
ALLERGIC
RESPONSE
TO
SPECIFICIALLY
CANDIDA
ALBICANS
AND
I
SHOWED
A
STRONG
POSITIVE
ANOTHER
QUESTION
WOULD
EVERYBODY
SHOW
THE
SAME
STRONG
POSITIVE
SO
THIS
TEST
IS
ESSENTIALLY
USELESS
AND
ASSUMING
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
CANDIDA
CAN
GROW
PARTWAY
INTO
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
TISSUE
AND
THE
CONCENTRATION
EXCEEDS
A
THRESHOLD
AMOUNT
COULD
NOT
A
PERSON
WHO
TESTS
AS
HAVING
AN
ALLERGY
TO
CANDIDA
DEFINITELY
DEVELOP
ALLERGIC
SYMPTOMS
SUCH
AS
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
IRRITATION
DUE
TO
THE
BODYS
ALLERGIC
RESPONSE
AS
I
SAID
IN
AN
EARLIER
POST
ONE
DOES
NOT
NEED
TO
BE
A
ROCKET
SCIENTIST
OR
HAVE
A
MD
DEGREE
OR
A
PHD
IN
BIOCHEMISTRY
TO
SEE
THE
PLAUSIBILITY
OF
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
BTW
AND
ILL
REPOST
THIS
AGAIN
DR
IVKER
IN
HIS
BOOK
SINUS
SURVIVAL
HAS
ROUTINELY
GIVEN
BEFORE
ANYTHING
ELSE
NIZORAL
A
PRESPORANOX
SYSTEMIC
ANTIFUNGAL
NOT
AS
SAFE
AND
NOT
AS
GOOD
AS
SPORANOX
TO
HIS
NEW
CHRONIC
SINUSITIS
PATIENTS
IF
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
ON
ANTIBIOTICS
FOUR
OR
MORE
TIMES
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
YEARS
HE
CLAIMS
THAT
OUT
OF
OR
SO
PATIENTS
WELL
OVER
NOTICE
SOME
RELIEF
OF
SINUS
INFLAMMATION
AND
OTHER
SYMPTOMS
BUT
IT
DOESNT
CURE
IT
BY
ANY
MEANS
IMPLYING
THE
SOCALLED
YEASTFUNGUS
INFECTION
IS
NOT
THE
PRIMARY
CAUSE
BUT
A
LATER
COMPLICATION
HES
ALSO
FOUND
THAT
NYSTATIN
WHETHER
TAKEN
INTERNALLY
OR
PUT
INTO
A
SINUS
SPRAY
DOES
NOT
HELP
THIS
IMPLIES
OF
COURSE
ASSUMING
THAT
EXCESSIVE
YEASTFUNGUS
BLOOM
IS
AGGRAVATING
THE
SINUS
INFLAMMATION
THAT
THE
YEASTFUNGUS
HAS
GROWN
PARTWAY
INTO
THE
TISSUE
SINCE
NYSTATIN
WILL
NOT
KILL
YEASTFUNGUS
OTHER
THAN
BY
DIRECT
CONTACT
IT
IS
NOT
ABSORBED
INTO
THE
BLOOD
STREAM
AGAIN
I
ADMIT
LOTS
OF
IFS
AND
IMPLIES
WHICH
DOESNT
PLEASE
THE
HARDCORE
NT
WHO
HAS
TO
HAVE
THE
DOUBLEBLIND
STUDY
OR
ITS
A
NONISSUE
BUT
ONE
HAS
TO
START
WITH
SOME
PLAUSIBLE
HYPOTHESISEXPLANATION
A
STRAWMAN
IF
YOU
WILL
IF
ITS
INTERNAL
ONLY
SYMPTOMS
CAN
BE
USED
AND
THESE
SYMPTOMS
ARE
PRETTY
NONDESCRIPT
THIS
BRINGS
UP
AN
INTERESTING
OBSERVATION
USED
BY
THOSE
WHO
WILL
DENY
AND
REJECT
ANY
AND
ALL
ASPECTS
OF
THE
YEAST
HYPOTHESIS
UNTIL
THE
APPROPRIATE
STUDIES
ARE
DONE
AND
THAT
IS
IF
YOU
CANT
OBSERVE
OR
CULTURE
THE
YEAST
BLOOM
IN
THE
GUT
OR
SINUS
THEN
THERES
NO
WAY
TO
DIAGNOSE
OR
EVEN
RECOGNIZE
THE
DISEASE
AND
I
KNOW
THEY
REALIZE
THAT
IT
IS
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TEST
FOR
CANDIDA
OVERBLOOM
IN
ANY
PART
OF
THE
BODY
THAT
CANNOT
BE
EASILY
OBSERVED
SINCE
CANDIDA
IS
EVERYWHERE
IN
THE
BODY
ITS
A
REAL
ANOTHER
THOSE
WHO
TOTALLY
REJECT
THE
YEAST
HYPOTHESIS
SAY
THAT
NO
STUDIES
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
ACTUALLY
STUDIES
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
BUT
IF
ITS
NOT
UP
TO
A
CERTAIN
STANDARD
THEN
IT
IS
FROM
THEIR
PERSPECTIVE
A
NONSTUDY
WHICH
SHOULD
NOT
EVEN
BE
CONSIDERED
I
AGREE
THAT
THE
APPROPRIATE
STUDIES
SHOULD
BE
DONE
AND
THAT
WILL
TAKE
BIG
TO
DO
IT
RIGHT
HOWEVER
IN
ORDER
TO
CONVINCE
THE
FUNDING
AGENCIES
IN
THESE
AUSTERE
TIMES
TO
OPEN
THEIR
WALLETS
YOU
LITERALLY
HAVE
TO
GIVE
THEM
EVIDENCE
AND
THE
ONLY
ACCEPTABLE
EVIDENCE
TO
COMPETE
WITH
OTHER
PROPOSALS
IS
PARADOXICALLY
TO
DO
ALMOST
THE
EXACT
STUDY
NEEDED
FUNDING
THAT
IS
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
OF
THE
STUDY
BEFORE
YOU
EVEN
GET
FUNDING
AS
A
SCIENTIST
AT
A
NATIONAL
LAB
IM
VERY
AWARE
OF
THIS
FOR
THE
SMALLER
FUNDED
PROJECTS
IM
AFRAID
THAT
EVEN
IF
DR
IVKER
AND
OTHER
DOCTORS
GOT
TOGETHER
POOLED
THEIR
PRACTICES
CASE
HISTORIES
AND
ANECDOTES
INTO
A
COMPELLING
PICTURE
AND
APPROACH
THE
FUNDING
AGENCIES
THEY
WOULD
GET
NOWHERE
EVEN
IF
THEY
WERE
ABLE
TO
PUBLISH
THEIR
STATISTICAL
RESULTS
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
FROM
THE
COMMENTS
BY
SOME
OF
THE
DOCTORS
HERE
IS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
DECIDED
EXCESSIVE
YEAST
COLONIZATION
IN
THE
GUT
OR
SINUSES
LEADING
TO
NOTICEABLE
NONLETHAL
SYMPTOMS
DOES
NOT
EXIST
AND
IS
NOT
EVEN
A
TENABLE
HYPOTHESIS
SO
ANY
AMOUNT
OF
CASE
HISTORIES
OR
COMPILED
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
WILL
NEVER
CHANGE
THEIR
MIND
AND
NOT
ONLY
THAT
THEY
WOULD
ALSO
OPPOSE
THE
NEEDED
STUDIES
BECAUSE
IN
THEIR
MINDS
ITS
A
DONE
ISSUE
EXCESSIVE
YEAST
GROWTH
LEADING
TO
DIFFUSE
ALLERGIC
SYMPTOMS
DOES
NOT
WILL
NOT
AND
CANNOT
EXIST
PERIOD
KIND
OF
TOUGH
TO
DIALOG
WITH
THOSE
WHO
HOLD
SUCH
A
VIEWPOINT
KIND
OF
REMINDS
ME
OF
LISTER
CANDIDA
IS
KEPT
IN
CHECK
IN
MOST
PEOPLE
BY
THE
NORMAL
BACTERIAL
FLORA
IN
THE
SINUSES
THE
GI
TRACTMOUTH
STOMACH
AND
INTESTINES
AND
IN
THE
VAGINAL
TRACT
WHICH
COMPETE
WITH
IT
FOR
FOOD
THE
HUMAN
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
USUSALLY
DOES
NOT
BOTHER
ITSELF
WITH
THESENONPATHOGENIC
ORGANISMS
UNLESS
THEY
BROACH
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
BARRIER
IF
THEY
DO
AN
INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE
WILL
BE
SET
UP
MOST
AMERICANS
ARE
NOT
GETTING
ENOUGH
VITAMIN
A
FROM
THEIR
DIETS
ABOUT
OF
ALL
AMERICANS
DIE
WITH
LESS
VITAMIN
A
THAN
THEY
WERE
BORN
WITHUS
AUTOPSY
STUDIES
WHILE
THIS
LOW
LEVEL
OF
VITAMIN
A
DOES
NOT
CAUSE
PATHOLOGYBLINDNESS
IT
DOES
IMPAIR
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
BARRIER
SYSTEM
THIS
WOULD
THEN
BE
A
PREDISPOSING
FACTOR
FOR
A
STRONG
INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE
AFTER
A
CANDIDA
BLOOM
ARENT
THERE
ALSO
OTHER
NUTRIENTS
NECESSARY
TO
THE
PROPER
WORKING
OF
THE
SINUS
MUCUS
MEMBRANES
AND
CILIA
WHILE
DIABETICS
CAN
SUFFER
FROM
A
CANDIDA
BLOOM
THE
MOST
COMMON
CAUSE
OF
THIS
TYPE
OF
BLOOM
IS
THE
USE
OF
BROAD
SPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTICS
WHICH
KNOCK
DOWN
MANY
DIFFERENT
KINDS
OF
BACTERIA
IN
THE
BODY
AND
REMOVE
THE
MAIN
COMPETITION
FOR
CANDIDA
AS
FAR
AS
FOOD
IS
CONCERNED
WHILE
DRUGS
ARE
AVAILABLE
TO
HANDLE
CANDIDA
MANY
PATIENTS
FIND
THAT
THEIR
DOCTOR
WILL
NOT
USE
THEM
UNLESS
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
OF
A
SYSTEMIC
INFECTION
THE
TOXICITY
OF
THE
ANTIFUNGAL
DRUGS
DOES
WARRANT
SOME
CAUTION
BUT
IF
THE
GI
OR
SINUS
INFLAMMATION
IS
SUSPECTED
TO
BE
CANDIDAAND
RECENT
USE
OF
A
BROAD
SPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTIC
IS
THE
SMOKING
GUN
THEN
ANTIFUNGAL
USE
SHOULD
BE
APPRORPRIATE
JUST
AS
THE
ANTIFUNGAL
CREAMS
ARE
AN
APPROPRIATE
TREATMENT
FOR
RECURRING
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
IN
SPITE
OF
WHAT
MR
STEVE
DYER
SAYS
AGAIN
THE
EVIDENCE
FROM
MYCOLOGICAL
STUDIES
INDICATE
THAT
MANY
YEASTFUNGUS
SPECIES
CAN
GROW
HYPHAE
ROOTS
INTO
DEEP
TISSUE
SIMILAR
TO
MOLD
GROWING
IN
BREAD
YOU
CAN
CONTINUE
TO
KILL
THE
SURFACE
SUCH
AS
NYSTATIN
DOES
BUT
YOU
CANT
KILL
THAT
WHICH
IS
DEEPER
IN
THE
TISSUE
WITHOUT
USING
A
SYSTEMIC
ANTIFUNGAL
SUCH
AS
ITRACONAZOLE
SPORANOX
OR
SOME
OF
THE
OLDER
ONES
SUCH
AS
NIZORAL
WHICH
ARE
MORE
TOXIC
AND
NOT
AS
EFFECTIVE
THIS
IS
WHY
AS
HAS
BEEN
POINTED
OUT
BY
RECENT
STUDIES
SENT
TO
ME
BY
A
DOCTOR
IVE
BEEN
IN
EMAIL
CONTACT
WITH
THANKS
THAT
NYSTATIN
IS
NOT
EFFECTIVE
IN
THE
LONG
TERM
TREATMENT
OF
GI
TRACT
CANDIDIASIS
ITS
LIKE
TRYING
TO
WEED
A
GARDEN
BY
CUTTING
OFF
WHATS
ABOVE
THE
GROUND
BUT
LEAVING
THE
ROOTS
READY
TO
COME
OUT
AGAIN
ONCE
YOU
WALK
AWAY
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
A
CONTAINED
CANDIDA
BLOOM
CAN
PARTIALLY
GROW
INTO
TISSUE
THROUGH
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANES
CAUSING
SOME
TYPES
OF
SYMPTOMS
IN
SUSCEPTIBLE
PEOPLE
EG
ALLERGY
WITHOUT
BECOMING
SYSTEMIC
IN
THE
CLASSICAL
SENSE
OF
THE
WORD
SOMETHING
IN
BETWEEN
STRICTLY
AN
EXCESSIVE
BLOOM
NOT
CAUSING
ANY
PROBLEMS
AND
THE
FULLBLOWN
SYSTEMIC
INFECTION
THAT
IS
POTENTIALLY
LETHAL
IN
THE
GI
SYSTEM
THE
ANORECTAL
REGION
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
PARTICULARLY
GOOD
RESERVOIR
FOR
CANDIDA
AND
THE
USE
OF
PANTYHOSE
BY
MANY
WOMEN
CREATES
A
VERY
FAVORABLE
ENVIRONMENT
AROUND
THE
RECTUM
FOR
TRANSFERTHROUGH
MOISTURE
AND
HUMIDITY
OF
CANDIDA
TO
THE
VAGINAL
TRACT
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
EFFCTIVE
WAYS
TO
MINIMMIZE
THIS
TRANSFER
IS
TO
WEAR
UNDYED
COTTON
UNDERWEAR
ALSO
IF
ONE
IS
AN
ANAL
RETENTIVE
LIKE
IVE
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
IN
A
PRIOR
POST
THAT
CAN
ALSO
PROVIDE
MORE
SITES
FOR
EXCESSIVE
CANDIDA
GROWTH
IF
THE
BLOOM
OCCURS
IN
THE
ANAL
AREA
THE
BURNING
SWELLING
PAIN
AND
EVEN
BLOOD
DISCHARGE
MAKE
MANY
PATIENTS
THINK
THAT
THEY
HAVE
HEMORROIDS
IF
THE
BLOOM
MANAGES
TO
MOVE
FURTHER
UP
THE
GI
TRACT
VERY
DIFFUSE
SYMPTOMATOLOGY
OCCURSABDOMINAL
DISCOMFORT
AND
BLOOD
IN
THE
STOOL
THIS
POSITIVE
STOOL
FOR
OCCULT
BLOOD
IS
WHAT
SENT
ELAINE
TO
HER
FAMILY
DOCTOR
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AFTER
EXTENSIVE
TESTING
HE
TOLD
HER
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
WRONG
BUT
HER
GUT
STILL
HURT
ON
TO
ANOTHER
DOCTOR
AND
SO
ON
RICHARD
KAPLAN
HAS
TOLD
ME
THROIUGH
EMAIL
THAT
HE
CONSIDERS
OCCULT
BLOOD
TESTS
IN
STOOL
SPECIMENS
TO
BE
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
AND
MONEY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
VERY
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
FALSE
POSITIVESCANDIDA
BLOOMS
GUYS
IF
MY
GUT
HURT
ME
ON
A
CONSTANT
BASIS
I
WOULD
WANT
IT
FIXED
YES
ITS
NICE
TO
KNOW
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
COLON
CANCER
BUT
WHAT
THEN
IS
CAUSING
MY
DISTRESS
WHEN
I
FINALLY
FIND
A
DOCTOR
WHO
TREATS
ME
AND
GETS
ME
BETTER
STEVE
DYER
CALLS
HIM
A
QUACK
AS
IVE
SAID
IN
PRIVATE
EMAIL
THERE
ARE
FLAWS
IN
OUR
CURRENT
MEDICAL
SYSTEM
THAT
MAKE
IT
DIFFICULT
OR
EVEN
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
A
PHYSICIAN
TO
ATTEMPT
ALTERNATIVE
THERAPIES
AFTER
THE
APPROVEDPROVENACCEPTED
THERAPIES
DONT
WORK
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
WENT
TO
THREE
ENTS
WHO
ALL
SAID
THAT
I
WILL
JUST
HAVE
TO
LIVE
WITH
MY
ACUTECHRONIC
SINUSITIS
AFTER
THE
ABS
FAILED
THEY
DID
MENTION
SURGERY
TO
OPEN
UP
THE
OSTIA
BUT
MY
OSTIA
WERENT
PLUGGED
AND
IT
WOULD
NOT
GET
TO
THE
ROOT
CAUSE
OF
MY
CONDITION
AFTER
THREE
MONTHS
OF
AGGRESSIVE
AND
FAIRLY
NONSTANDARD
THERAPY
SPORANOX
BODY
NUTRIENT
LEVEL
MONITORING
AND
EQUALIZATION
VITAMIN
C
LENTINEN
ECHINACEA
ETC
MY
HEALTH
HAS
VASTLY
IMPROVED
TO
WHERE
I
WAS
TWO
YEARS
AGO
BEFORE
MY
HEALTH
GREATLY
DETERIORATED
OF
COURSE
SKEPTICS
WOULD
SAY
THAT
MAYBE
IF
I
DID
NOTHING
I
WOULD
HAVE
IMPROVED
ANYWAY
BUT
THAT
VIEW
IS
STRETCHING
THINGS
QUITE
FAR
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
THREE
ENTS
I
SAW
WHO
SAID
THAT
ID
JUST
HAVE
TO
LIVE
WITH
IT
IM
CONFIDENT
I
WILL
REACH
WHAT
ONE
COULD
CALL
A
TOTAL
CURE
THE
ANTIFUNGAL
PROGRAM
I
UNDERTOOK
WAS
ONE
NECESSARY
STEP
IN
THAT
DIRECTION
BECAUSE
OF
MY
OVERUSE
OF
ABS
FOR
THE
LAST
FOUR
YEARS
NOTE
FOR
THOSE
HAVING
SINUS
PROBLEMS
MAY
I
SUGGEST
THE
BOOK
BY
DR
IVKER
I
MENTION
ABOVE
BE
SURE
TO
GET
THE
REVISED
EDITION
I
HAVE
OFTEN
WONDERED
WHAT
AN
MD
WITH
CHRONIC
GI
DISTRESS
OR
SINUS
PROBLEMS
WOULD
DO
ABOUT
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
HE
TELLS
HIS
PATIENTS
IS
A
NONEXISTENT
SYNDROME
DR
IVKER
STARTED
OFF
HAVING
CHRONIC
AND
SEVERE
SINUS
PROBLEMS
AND
HIS
VISITS
TO
SEVERAL
ENTS
TOTALLY
FLOORED
HIM
WHEN
THEY
SAID
YOULL
JUST
HAVE
TO
LIVE
WITH
IT
HE
SPENT
SEVERAL
YEARS
TRYING
EVERYTHING
STANDARD
AND
NONSTANDARD
UNTIL
HE
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
CURED
OF
CHRONIC
SINUSITIS
HE
NOW
SHARES
HIS
APPROACH
IN
HIS
BOOK
AND
I
CAN
HONESTLY
SAY
THAT
I
AM
ON
THE
ROAD
TO
RECOVERY
FOLLOWING
SOME
PARTS
OF
IT
HIS
ONE
RECOMMENDATION
TO
TAKE
A
SYSTEMIC
ANTIFUNGAL
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
TREATMENT
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
HISTORY
OF
ANTIBIOTIC
OVERUSE
HAS
BEEN
PROVEN
TO
HIM
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
IN
HIS
OWN
PRACTICE
IM
SURE
IF
I
COMMENTED
TO
HIM
OF
THE
HARDCORE
BELIEFS
OF
THE
ANTI
YEAST
HYPOTHESIS
POSTERS
THAT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
DEFINITE
THINGS
TO
SAY
SUCH
AS
ITS
WORKED
WONDERS
FOR
ME
IN
ALMOST
TWO
THOUSAND
CASES
TO
PUT
IT
MILDLY
I
ALSO
WOULD
NOT
BE
SURPRISED
IF
HE
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THEY
ARE
THE
ONES
VIOLATING
THEIR
MORAL
OBLIGATIONS
TO
HELP
THE
PATIENT
MAYBE
THOSE
DOCTORS
WHO
ARE
READING
THIS
WHO
HAVE
A
PRACTICE
AND
ARE
CONFRONTED
BY
A
PATIENT
HAVING
SYMPTOMS
THAT
COULD
BE
DUE
TO
THE
HYPOTHETICAL
YEAST
OVERGROWTH
EG
THEY
FIT
SOME
OF
THE
PROFILES
THE
PROYEAST
PEOPLE
HAVE
IDENTIFIED
SHOULD
CONSIDER
ANTIFUNGAL
THERAPY
IF
ALL
OTHER
AVENUES
HAVE
BEEN
EXHAUSTED
REMEMBER
THEORY
AND
PRACTICE
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
YOU
CANNOT
HAVE
ONE
WITHOUT
THE
OTHER
THEY
ARE
SYNERGISTIC
IF
A
DOCTOR
DOES
SOMETHING
NONSTANDARD
YET
PRODUCES
NOTICEABLE
SYMPTOMATIC
RELIEF
IN
OVER
A
THOUSAND
OF
HIS
PATIENTS
SHOULDNT
YOU
AT
LEAST
SIT
UP
AND
TAKE
NOTICE
MAYBE
YOU
OUGHT
TO
TRUST
WHAT
HE
SAYS
AND
BEGIN
HYPOTHESIZING
WHY
IT
WORKS
INSTEAD
OF
WHY
IT
SHOULDNT
WORK
IM
AFRAID
A
LOT
OF
DOCTORS
HAVE
BECOME
SO
ENAMORED
WITH
SCIENTIFIC
CORRECTNESS
THAT
THEY
ARE
IGNORING
THE
PATIENTS
THEY
HAVE
SWORN
TO
HELP
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
BOTH
BOTH
HAVE
TO
BE
BALANCED
WHICH
WE
DONT
SEE
FROM
SOME
OF
THE
POSTERS
TO
THIS
GROUP
THERE
COMES
A
POINT
WHEN
YOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
USE
A
LITTLE
COMMON
SENSE
AND
MAYBE
AN
EMPIRICAL
APPROACH
SUCH
AS
TRYING
A
GOOD
SYSTEMIC
ANTIFUNGAL
SUCH
AS
SPORANOX
AFTER
HAVING
EXHAUSTED
ALL
THE
OTHER
AVENUES
I
WAS
ONE
OF
THOSE
WHO
THE
TRADITIONAL
MEDICAL
ESTABLISHMENT
WAS
NOT
ABLE
TO
HELP
SO
I
DID
THE
NATURAL
THING
I
WENT
TO
A
COUPLE
OF
DOCTORS
WHO
ARE
SOMEWHAT
OUTSIDE
THIS
ESTABLISHMENT
AND
AS
A
RESULT
I
HAVE
FOUND
SIGNIFICANT
RELIEF
WOULD
IT
NOT
BE
BETTER
IF
THE
TRADITIONAL
MEDICAL
ESTABLISHMENT
CAN
SET
UP
SOME
KIND
OF
MECHANISM
WHERE
ANY
DOCTOR
WITHOUT
FEAR
OF
BEING
SUED
OR
HAVING
HIS
LICENSE
PULLED
CAN
TRY
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
UNPROVEN
BEYOND
A
DOUBT
THERAPIES
FOR
HISHER
PATIENTS
THAT
FINALLY
REACH
THE
POINT
WHERE
ALL
THE
ACCEPTED
THERAPIES
ARE
INEFFECTIVE
ID
LIKE
TO
HEAR
A
DOCTOR
TELL
ME
WELL
IVE
TRIED
ALL
THE
THERAPIES
THAT
ARE
APPROVED
AND
ACCEPTED
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AND
SINCE
THEY
CLEARLY
DONT
WORK
FOR
YOU
I
NOW
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
USE
EXPERIMENTAL
UNPROVEN
TECHNIQUES
THAT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
HELPED
OTHERS
I
CANT
PROMISE
ANYTHING
AND
THERE
ARE
SOME
RISKS
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
SIGN
SOMETHING
SAYING
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
AND
POSSIBLY
RISKY
NATURE
OF
THESE
UNPROVEN
THERAPIES
AND
ILL
HAVE
TO
REGISTER
YOUR
CASE
AT
THE
STATE
BOARD
ANYWAY
IF
MY
ENT
HAD
SUGGESTED
THIS
TO
ME
I
WOULDVE
JUMPED
ON
THIS
PRONTO
INSTEAD
OF
GOING
TO
ONE
OF
THOSE
DOCTORS
WHO
FOR
EITHER
ALTRUISTIC
REASONS
OR
FOR
GREED
IS
PRACTICING
THESE
ALTERNATIVE
THERAPIES
WITH
MUCH
RISK
TO
HIMHER
RISK
MEANING
LOSING
THEIR
LICENSE
AND
POSSIBLY
TO
THE
PATIENT
SUCH
A
MECHANISM
WOULD
KEEP
CONTROL
IN
THE
MORE
MAINSTREAM
MEDICINE
AND
ALSO
PROVIDE
VALUABLE
DATA
THAT
WOULD
ESSENTIALLY
BE
FREE
IT
ALSO
WOULD
BE
MORALLY
AND
ETHICALLY
BETTER
THAN
THE
CURRENT
SYSTEM
BY
SHOWING
THE
COMPASSION
OF
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
TO
THE
PATIENT
THAT
ITS
DOING
EVERYTHING
IT
CAN
WITHIN
REASON
TO
HELP
THE
PATIENT
IT
IS
THE
LACK
OF
SUCH
A
MECHANISM
THAT
IS
LEADING
LARGE
NUMBERS
OF
PEOPLE
TO
TRY
ALTERNATIVE
THERAPIES
SOME
OF
WHICH
SEEM
TO
WORK
LIKE
MY
CASE
AND
OTHERS
OF
WHICH
WILL
NEVER
WORK
AT
ALL
TRUE
QUACKERY
I
BETTER
GET
OFF
MY
SOAPBOX
BEFORE
THIS
POST
REACHES
IN
SIZE
IF
TAKEN
ORALLY
IT
CAN
ALSO
BECOME
A
MAJOR
BACTERIA
IN
THE
GUT
THROUGH
ARESOL
SPRAYS
IT
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
USED
TO
INNOCULATE
THE
SINUS
MEMBRANES
BUT
BEFORE
THIS
INNOCULATION
OCCURS
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
BARRIER
SYSTEM
NEEDS
TO
BE
STRENGTHENED
THIS
IS
ACCOMPLISHED
BY
VITAMIN
A
VITAMIN

AND
SOME
OF
THE

SURVEYS
REPEATEDLY
SHOW
THAT
AMERICANS
ARE
NOT
GETTING

AND

THESE
ARE
PROBABLY
THE

OF
THE

THAT
WILL
HAVE
THE
GREATEST

AS

AS

FROM

I
WILL
BE
POSTING
A
DISCUSSION
OF
VITAMIN
A
SOMETIME
IN
THE
FUTURE
ALONG
WITH
REFERENCE
CITINGS
TO
POINT
OUT
THE
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
ROLE
THAT
VITAMIN
A
PLAYS
IN
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
DEFENSE
SYSTEM
IN
THE
BODY
AND
WHY
VITAMIN
A
SHOULD
BE
EFFECTIVE
IN
DEALING
WITH
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
ANOTHER
EFFECTIVE
DIETARY
TREATMENT
IS
TO
RESTRICT
CARBOHYDRATE
INTAKE
DURING
THE
TREATMENT
PHASE
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT
IF
THE
GI
SYSTEM
IS
INVOLVED
IF
CANDIDA
CAN
NOT
GET
GLUCOSE
ITS
NOT
GOING
TO
OUT
GROW
THE
BACTERIA
AND
YOU
THEN
GIVE
BACTERIA
WHICH
CAN
USE
AMINO
ACIDS
AND
FATTY
ACIDS
FOR
ENERGY
A
CHANCE
TO
TAKE
OVER
AND
KEEP
THE
CANDIDA
IN
CHECK
ONCE
CARBOHYDRATE
IS
RETURNED
TO
THE

ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
THE
ROLE
OF
COMPLEX
CARBOHYDRATES
SUCH
AS
STARCH
IF
STEVE
AND
SOME
OF
THE

WANT
TO

JUMPED
