mevicore
vs
lopid
vs
i
used
to
be
on
lopid
it
did
a
good
job
of
reducing
cholesterol
down
to
around
as
well
as
ldl
and
triglycerides
then
i
got
pneumonia
and
for
some
reason
the
lopid
stopped
working
very
well
cholesterol
and
triglycerides
soared
the
levels
might
have
stabilized
over
time
but
a
new
doctor
had
me
quit
wait
a
month
then
switch
to
mevicore
on
mevicore
my
total
cholesterol
was
down
to
ldl
was
and
hdl
was
but
the
trigs
were
still
very
high
around
and
my
liver
tests
came
back
slightly
abnormal
sgot
n
ggtphard
to
read
copy
n
he
said
the
liver
numbers
were
not
offbase
enough
to
cause
him
concern
and
the
triglycerides
are
not
as
important
as
the
cholesterol
figures
he
had
me
stop
the
mevicore
to
allow
the
liver
to
heal
just
to
be
extra
cautious
though
im
sure
its
not
a
problem
and
wants
me
to
go
back
on
it
after
that
i
suggested
maybe
lopid
might
be
the
better
choice
and
he
said
that
he
wouldnt
object
if
thats
what
i
want
to
do
but
lopid
has
one
particular
side
effect
im
not
fond
of
should
the
above
liver
and
trig
figures
be
feared
what
happens
to
folks
with
high
trig
levels
is
my
liver
in
danger
with
the
above
results
would
i
be
better
off
on
lopid
despite
its
inconvenient
side
effect
or
perhaps
some
other
drug
niacin
affected
my
liver
too
