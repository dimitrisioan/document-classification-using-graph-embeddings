WRITES
HI
ALL
MY
SKIN
IS
VERY
DRY
IN
GENERAL
BUT
THE
MOST
SERIOUS
PART
IS
LOCATED
FROM
KNEES
DOWN
THE
SKIN
THERE
LOOKS
LIKE
SEGMENTED
THE
SEGMENTATION
ACTUALLY
HAPPENS
BENEATH
THE
SKIN
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
CURE
FOR
THIS
AT
THE
SUPERMARKETS
OR
PHARMACIES
THERE
ARE
QUITE
A
LOT
OF
STUFFS
FOR
DRY
SKINS
BUT
WHAT
TO
CHOSE
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
FOR
ALL
ADVICES
AND
HINTS
REPLY
BY
EMAIL
PREFERRED
ALEX
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FACT
I
JUST
SAW
A
DERMATOLOGIST
THE
OTHER
DAY
AND
WHILE
I
WAS
THERE
I
ASKED
HIM
ABOUT
DRY
SKIN
ID
BEEN
SPENDING
A
SMALL
FORTUNE
ON
VARIOUS
CREAMS
LOTIONS
AND
OTHER
DRY

TREATMENTS
HE
SAID
ALL
I
NEEDED
WAS

LARGE
JAR
OF
VASELINE
SOAK
IN
A
LUKEWARM

OF
WATER
FOR
MINUTES
ONLY

THEN
MASSAGE
IN
THE
VASELINE
TO
TRAP
THE
MOISTURE
IN
THAT

HELP
I
HAVENT
TRIED
IT
YET
BUT
YOU
CAN
BET
I
WILL
THE
HARD
PART
WILL
BE
FINDING
THE
TIME
TO
RUB
IN
THE
VASELINE
PROPERLY
IF
ITS
NOT
DONE
RIGHT
YOU
REMAIN
GREASY
AND
STICK
TO
YOUR
CLOTHES
