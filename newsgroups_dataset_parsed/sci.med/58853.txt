RE
SCIENCE
AND
METHODOLOGY
WAS
HOMEOPATHY
TRADITION
I
AGREE
WITH
EVERYTHING
THAT
LEE
LADY
WROTE
IN
HER
PREVIOUS
POST
IN
THIS
THREAD
IN
CASE
THIS
PUZZLES
PEOPLE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
EXPAND
ON
TWO
OF
HER
COMMENTS
IN
ARTICLE
LADYUHUNIXUHCCHAWAIIEDU
LEE
LADY
WRITES
AVOIDING
MISTAKES
IS
CERTAINLY
HIGHLY
DESIRABLE
HOWEVER
IT
IS
ALSO
WIDELY
ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT
PERFECTIONISM
IS
INIMICABLE
TO
CREATIVITY
IN
THE
EXTREME
CASE
A
PERFECTIONIST
BECOMES
SO
PARALYZED
BY
ALL
THE
POSSIBLE
MISTAKES
HE
MIGHT
MAKE
THAT
HE
IS
UNABLE
TO
EVEN
LEAVE
THE
HOUSE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
AND
DIFFICULT
ASPECTS
OF
REASONING
ABOUT
EMPIRICAL
INVESTIGATION
LIES
IN
UNDERSTANDING
THE
CONTEXT
SCOPE
AND
IMPORTANCE
OF
THE
VARIOUS
ARGUMENTS
AND
PIECES
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
ARE
MARSHALLED
FOR
A
CLAIM
SOME
ERRORS
BREAK
THE
BACK
OF
A
PIECE
OF
RESEARCH
SOME
LEAVE
A
HOLE
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
FILLED
IN
AND
SOME
ARE
TRIVIAL
IN
THEIR
IMPORTANCE
IT
IS
A
GRAVE
MISTAKE
TO
CONFUSE
THESE
PAST
SNIPPETS
FROM
THIS
THREAD
I
DOUBT
IF
EINSTEIN
USED
ANY
FORMAL
METHODOLOGY
HE
ALSO
PROPOSED
NUMEROUS
EXPERIMENTS
WHICH
IF
PERFORMED
WOULD
DISTINGUISH
A
UNIVERSE
IN
WHICH
SPECIAL
RELATIVITY
HOLDS
FROM
ONE
IN
WHICH
IT
DOES
NOT
BACK
TO
LEE
LADY
THESE
ARE
NOT
THE
RULES
ACCORDING
TO
MANY
WHO
POST
TO
SCIMED
AND
SCIPSYCHOLOGY
ACCORDING
TO
THESE
POSTERS
IF
ITS
NOT
SUPPORTED
BY
CAREFULLY
DESIGNED
CONTROLLED
STUDIES
THEN
ITS
NOT
SCIENCE
THESE
POSTERS
ARE
MAKING
THE
MISTAKE
THAT
I
HAVE
PREVIOUSLY
CRITICIZED
OF
ADHERING
TO
A
METHODOLOGICAL
RECIPE
A
CAREFULLY
DESIGNED
AND
CONTROLLED
STUDY
IS
NEITHER
ALWAYS
POSSIBLE
NOR
ALWAYS
IMPORTANT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
SOMEONE
IS
PROPOSING
A
REMEDY
THAT
SUPPOSEDLY
ALLEVIATES
A
CHRONIC
MEDICAL
PROBLEM
WE
HAVE
ENOUGH
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
ERRORS
THAT
HAVE
PLAGUED
THIS
KIND
OF
CLAIM
TO
ASK
FOR
A
CAREFULLY
DESIGNED
AND
CONTROLLED
STUDY
TO
ALLEVIATE
OUR
SKEPTICISM
RULES
SUCH
AS
SUPPORT
THE
HYPOTHESIS
BY
A
CAREFULLY
DESIGNED
AND
CONTROLLED
STUDY
ARE
TOO
NARROW
TO
APPLY
TO
ALL
INVESTIGATION
I
THINK
THAT
THE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
PARTICULAR
REASONING
TO
BE
CONVINCING
DEPENDS
GREATLY
ON
THE
KINDS
OF
MISTAKES
THAT
HAVE
OCCURRED
IN
PAST
REASONING
ABOUT
THE
SAME
KINDS
OF
THINGS
TO
REUSE
THE
PREVIOUS
EXAMPLE
WE
KNOW
THAT
CONCLUSIONS
FROM
UNCONTROLLED
OBSERVATIONS
OF
THE
TREATMENT
OF
CHRONIC
MEDICAL
PROBLEMS
ARE
NOTORIOUSLY
PROBLEMATIC
