AS

ABOUT

IM
REALLY
AMAZED
THAT
SOMEONE
HAS
NOT
DONE
A

DO
YOU
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
STUDY
BECAUSE
THEY
USED
YOGURT
RATHER
THAN
CAPSULES
OF
LACTOBACILLUS
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
HAD
POSITIVE

THE

WAS
A
CROSSOVER
TRIAL
OF
DAILY
INGESTION
OF

OF

THERE
WAS
A

ONLY
PATIENTS

ANALYZED
STILL
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN

BETWEEN
THE

WAS
SO
LARGE
THAT
THE

REMAINS
FAIRLY
BELIEVABLE
