like
it
does
in
the
vagina
as
much
stuff
as
there
is
in
the
lay
press
about
l
acidophilus
and
vaginal
yeast
infections
im
really
amazed
that
someone
has
not
done
a
clinical
trial
yet
to
check
it
out
ive
mentioned
this
study
a
couple
of
times
now
ingestion
of
yogurt
containing
lactobacillus
acidophilus
as
prophylaxis
for
candidal
vaginitis
annals
of
internal
medicine
do
you
have
a
problem
with
the
study
because
they
used
yogurt
rather
than
capsules
of
lactobacillus
even
though
it
had
positive
results
the
study
was
a
crossover
trial
of
daily
ingestion
of
ounces
of
yogurt
there
was
a
marked
decrease
in
infections
while
women
were
ingesting
the
yogurt
problems
with
the
study
included
very
small
numbers
patients
enrolled
and
many
protocol
violations
only
patients
were
analyzed
still
the
difference
in
rates
of
infection
between
the
two
groups
was
so
large
that
the
study
remains
fairly
believable
