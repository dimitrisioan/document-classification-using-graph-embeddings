discussions
on
altpsychoactives
date
apr
gmt
could
the
people
discussing
recreational
drugs
such
as
mj
lsd
mdma
etc
take
their
discussions
to
altdrugs
their
discussions
will
receive
greatest
contribution
and
readership
there
the
people
interested
in
strictly
smart
drugs
ie
nootropics
should
post
to
this
group
the
two
groups
altdrugs
altpsychoactives
have
been
used
interchangably
lately
i
do
think
that
altpsychoactives
is
a
deceiving
name
altpsychoactives
is
supposedly
the
smart
drug
newsgroup
according
to
newsgroup
lists
on
the
usenet
should
we
establish
an
altnootropics
or
altsdn
smart
drugs
nutrients
i
have
noticed
some
posts
in
scimednutrition
regarding
smart
nutrients
we
may
lower
that
groups
burden
as
well
i
beg
to
disagree
with
you
on
this
subject
if
i
recall
correctly
altdrugs
was
being
flodded
by
posts
like
how
do
i
grow
mj
how
do
i
use
a
bong
wow
man
i
just
had
the
coolest
trip
etc
there
were
quite
a
few
people
out
there
who
were
versed
in
pharmacology
and
biology
who
wanted
to
discuss
centrally
active
substabces
at
a
higher
level
without
all
the
other
crap
filling
the
bandwidth
i
would
suggest
that
you
proceed
to
create
a
newsgroup
dedicated
to
nootropics
if
you
must
have
one
dedicated
to
them
and
leave
altpsychoactives
to
the
discussion
of
psychoactives
including
nootropics
which
are
but
a
small
portion
of
the
realm
of
centrally
active
substances
i
was
wondering
if
a
group
called
scipharmacology
would
be
relevent
this
would
be
used
for
a
more
formal
discussion
about
pharmacological
issues
pharmacodynamics
neuropharmacology
etc
just
an
informal
proposal
i
dont
know
anything
about
the
netpolitics
for
adding
a
newsgroup
etc
more
altpsychoactives
stuff
