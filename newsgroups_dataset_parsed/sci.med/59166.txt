CONTAGIOSEM
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
HAD
ANY
INFORMATION
ABOUT
MOLLUSCOUS
CONTAGIOSEM
I
ACQUIRED
IT
AND
FORTUNATELY
GOT
RID
OF
IT
BUT
THE
QUESTION
STILL
LINGERS
IN
MY
MIND
WHERE
DID
IT
COME
FROM
THE
LITTLE
BIT
OF
INFO
THAT
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
ABOUT
IT
IN
THE
PAST
STATES
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
TRANSMITTED
SEXUALLY
BUT
ALSO
OCCURS
IN
SMALL
CHILDREN
ON
THE
HANDS
FEET
AND
GENITALIA
ANY
INFORMATION
WILL
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
I
GROW
OLD
I
GROW
OLD
I
SHALL
WEAR
MY
TROUSERS
ROLLED
T
