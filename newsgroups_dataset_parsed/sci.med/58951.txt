once
you
have
your
hypoglycemia
confirmed
through
the
proper
channels
you
might
consider
ther
following
diet
omitted
ronwhat
do
you
consider
to
be
proper
channelsthis
sounds
suspiciously
like
a
blood
chemistryglucose
tolerance
and
the
likesuddenly
chemistry
exists
you
know
perfectly
well
that
this
person
can
be
saved
needless
trouble
and
expense
with
simple
muscle
testing
and
hair
analysis
to
diagnoseno
confirm
any
aberrant
physiologybut
then
againmaybe
thats
what
you
meantby
proper
channels
were
you
able
to
understand
dick
kings
post
that
of
diseases
is
not
thesame
thing
as
of
patients
which
was
a
reply
to
your
inability
to
critically
evaluate
the
statistic
you
cited
from
the
new
england
journal
of

couldyou
figure
out
what
is
implied
by
the
remark
of

mds
are
ethically
bound
to
not
knowingly
dispense
placebos
ronhave
you
ever
thought
about
why
you
never
post

insist
instead
upon
insinuating
your
untrained
nonmedical
often
delusional
notions
of
health
and

into
this

i
suspect
from
your
apparent
anger
toward
mds
and
heteropathic
medicine
that
there
may
be
an
underlying

i
can
confirm

they
ponder
my

do
you
have
reservations
about
my
