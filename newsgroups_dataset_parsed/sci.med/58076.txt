MY
SON
HAS
THE
USUAL
TEENAGE
SPOTTY
CHIN
AND
GREASY
NOSE
I
BOUGHT
HIM
CLEARASIL
FACE
WASH
AND
OINTMENT
I
THINK
THAT
IS
PROBABLY
ENOUGH
ALONG
WITH
THE
USUAL
GOOD
DIET
HOWEVER
HE
IS
ON
AT
ME
TO
GET
SOME
PRODUCT
CALLED
DALACIN
T
WHICH
USED
TO
BE
A
DOCTORSPRESCRIPTION
ONLY
TREATMENT
BUT
IS
NOT
AVAILABLE
OVER
THE
CHEMISTS
COUNTER
I
HAVE
ASKED
A
COUPLE
OF
PHARMACISTS
WHO
SAY
EITHER
HIS
ACNE
IS
NOT
SEVERE
ENOUGH
FOR
DALACIN
T
OR
THAT
CLEARASIL
IS
OK
I
HAD
THE
ODD
SPOTS
AS
A
TEENAGER
NOTHING
SERIOUS
HIS
FATHER
WAS
THE
SAME
SO
I
DONT
FIGURE
HIS
ACNE
IS
GOING
TO
ESCALATE
INTO
SOMETHING
DISFIGURING
BUT
I
KNOW
KIDS
ARE
SENSTITIVE
ABOUT
THEIR
APPEARANCE
I
AM
WARY
BECAUSE
A
NEIGHBOURS
SON
HAD
THIS
WIERD
MALADY
THAT
WAS
EVENTUALLY
PUT
DOWN
TO
AN
OVERDOSE
OF
VITAMIN
A
FROM
ACNE
TREATMENT
I
WANT
TO
HELP
BUT
WITH
APPROPRIATE
TREATMENT
MY
SON
ALSO
HAS
SOME
SCALINESS
AROUND
THE
HAIRLINE
ON
HIS
SCALP
SORT
OF
TEENAGE
CRADLE
CAP
ANY
POINTERSADVICE
ON
THIS
WE
HAVE
TRIED
A
COUPLE
OF
ANTI
DANDRUFF
SHAMPOOS
AND
SOME
OF
THESE
ARE
INCLINED
TO
MAKE
THE
CONDITION
WORSE
NOT
BETTER
SHALL
I
BURY
THE
KID
TILL
HES
THE
FLOGGINGS
WILL
CONTINUE
UNTIL
MORALE
