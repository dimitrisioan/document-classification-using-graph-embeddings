WROTE
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
PLACEBOS
ARE
LEGAL
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
THAT
IF
AS
A
PATIENT
YOU
PURCHASE
A
DRUG
YOUVE
BEEN
PRESCRIBED
AND
ITS
JUST
SUGAR
OR
WHATEVER
THERES
A
FEW
LEGAL
COMPLICATIONS
THAT
ARISE
IF
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
WITH
A
CONDITION
AND
YOU
ARENT
GIVEN
ACCEPTED
TREATMENT
FOR
IT
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
INTENTIONAL
MEDICAL
MALPRACTICE
A
PLACEBO
IS
AN
ACCEPTED
TREATMENT
AT
TIMES
A
PLACEBO
SHOULD
FALL
LEGALLY
UNDER
THE
LABEL
OF
QUACKERY

I
DONT
KNOW

DRUGS
ARE
ALWAYS
LABELED

TO
FIND

WHATS
IN
A
PILL
IF
YOU
HAVE
THE
NAME
ITS
MORE
COMMON
TO
PRESCRIBE
A
DRUG
WHICH
IS
EFFECTIVE
FOR
SOMETHING
JUST
NOT
FOR
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
ANTIBIOTICS
FOR
VIRAL
INFECTIONS
ARE
THE
MOST
COMMON
SUCH
PLACEBO
GETTING
WHAT
YOU
PAY
FOR
DECEPTIVE

IM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
THIS
WHAT
