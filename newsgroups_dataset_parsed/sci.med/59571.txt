re
legality
of
placebos
calzoneathenamitedu
wrote
how
is
it
that
placebos
are
legal
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
as
a
patient
you
purchase
a
drug
youve
been
prescribed
and
its
just
sugar
or
whatever
theres
a
few
legal
complications
that
arise
if
you
have
been
diagnosed
with
a
condition
and
you
arent
given
accepted
treatment
for
it
it
seems
like
intentional
medical
malpractice
a
placebo
is
an
accepted
treatment
at
times
a
placebo
should
fall
legally
under
the
label
of
quackery
why
not
why
should
it
placebos
are
effective
under
certain
circumstances
thats
why
theyre
used
actually
i
dont
know
know
anyone
who
has
actually
gotten
a
sugar
pill
i
dont
know
how
it
could
be
done
since
prescription
drugs
are
always
labeled
and
its
easy
enough
to
find
out
whats
in
a
pill
if
you
have
the
name
its
more
common
to
prescribe
a
drug
which
is
effective
for
something
just
not
for
what
you
have
antibiotics
for
viral
infections
are
the
most
common
such
placebo
getting
what
you
pay
for
deceptive
bait
and
switch
to
an
extreme
false
advertising
what
if
mcdonalds
didnt
put
pure
beef
in
their
hamburgers
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
this
what
do
you
think
youre
paying
for
youre
not
entitled
to
a
prescription
drug
just
because
you
pay
for
a
doctors
appointment
