A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IS
SEEING
AN
ACUPUNCTURIST
AND
WANTS
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
DANGER
OF
GETTING
AIDS
FROM
THE
NEEDLES
ASK
THE
PRACTITIONER
WHETHER
HE
USES
THE
PRESTERILIZED
DISPOSABLE
NEEDLES
OR
IF
HE
REUSES
NEEDLES
STERILIZING
THEM
BETWEEN
USE
IN
THE
FORMER
CASE
THERES
NO
CONCEIVABLE
WAY
TO
GET
AIDS
FROM
THE
NEEDLES
IN
THE
LATTER
CASE
ITS
HIGHLY
UNLIKELY
THOUGH
MANY
PRACTITIONERS
USE
THE
DISPOSABLE
VARIETY
ANYWAY
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
TO
PERFORM
ACUPUNCTURE
WITH
UNSTERILIZED
NEEDLES
NO
LICENSED
PRACTITIONER
WOULD
DARE
DO
THIS
ALSO
THERE
IS
NOT
A
SINGLE
DOCUMENTED
CASE
OF
TRANSMISSION
OF
AIDS
VIA
ACUPUNCTURE
NEEDLES
I
WOULDNT
WORRY
ABOUT
IT
