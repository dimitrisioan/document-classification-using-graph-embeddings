FOCUS
OF
THE

PROFESSION
THE
AMA
AND
THE

SHOULD
FOCUS
ON
THESE
QUACKS
INSTEAD
OF
DEVOTING
UNBELIEVABLE
ENERGY
ON

ARE
TRYING

WILL
BE
KNOCKING
ON
MY
DOOR
TO
ASK
WHY
THIS
IS
A

ARGUMENT
ON

PEEPEE
ON

IN

LET
ME
PUT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
MAKE
MY
POINT
CLEAR
QUACK
IS
A
NEBULOUS
WORD
LACKING
IN
ANY
PRECISION
ITS
SOLE
USE
IS
TO
OBFUSCATE
THE
ISSUES
AT
HAND
FUNNY
I
THOUGHT
IT
MEANT
ONE
WHO
FRAUDULENTLY
MISREPRESENTS
HIS
ABILITY
AND
EXPERIENCE
IN
THE
DIAGNOSIS
AND
TREATMENT
OF
DISEASE
OR
THE
EFFECTS
TO
BE
ACHIEVED
BY
THE
TREATMENT
HE
OFFERS
DORLANDS
CERTAINLY
MORE
PRECISION
THAN
CONVEYED
BY
CHRONIC
YEAST
THE
INDISCRIMINATE
USE
OF
THIS
WORD
IS
A
SURE
SIGN
OF
INCOMPETENCY
AND
COMING
FROM
ANY
MEDICAL
DOCTOR
OR
WANNABE
WHERE
COMPETENCY
IS
EXPECTED
IS
REAL
SCARY
THE
INABILITY
TO
DISCRIMINATE
BETWEEN
FRAUDULENT
OR
ERRONEOUS
REPRESENTATIONS
IS
FAR
MORE
FRIGHTENING
IT
IS
FRAUD
TO
PROMOTE
A
TREATMENT
WHERE
THE
EVIDENCE
FOR
IT
IS
EITHER
LACKING
OR
AGAINST
IT
AND
THE
QUACKSALVER
KNOWS
SO
OR
ERROR
IF
THE
HONEST
PRACTITIONER
DOESNT
KNOW
SO
FAILURE
TO
SPEAK
OUT
AGAINST
EITHER
BESPEAKS
INCOMPETENCY
PS
MAY
I
SUGGEST
SERIOUSLY
THAT
IF
THE
DOCTORS
AND
WANNABEDOCTORS
ON
THE
NET
WHO
REFUSE
TO
HAVE
AN
OPEN
MIND
ON
ALTERNATIVE
TREATMENTS
AND
THEORIES
SUCH
AS
THE
YEAST
THEORY
SHOULD
CREATE
YOUR
OWN
MODERATED
GROUP
MAY
I
REPLY
SERIOUSLY
THAT
IF
THE
PRACTITIONERS
AND
PROPONENTS
OF
NONSCIENTIFIC
MEDICINE
HAVE
LEFT
THEIR
MINDS
SO
OPEN
THAT
THE
PARTS
OF
THEIR
BRAINS
THAT
DO

HAVE
FALLEN
OUT
THEY
SHOULD
