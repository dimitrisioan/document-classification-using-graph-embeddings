DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
POSIONOUS
CENTIPEDES
AND
MILLIPEDES
ARE
IF
SOMEONE
WAS
BITTEN
HOW
SOON
WOULD
MEDICAL
TREATMENT
BE
NEEDED
AND
WHAT
WOULD
BE
LIABLE
TO
HAPPEN
TO
THE
PERSON
JUST
FOR
CLARIFICATION
I
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
BITTEN
BY
ONE
OF
THESE
BUT
MY
HOUSE
SEEMS
TO
BE
INFESTED
AND
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
JUST
IN
CASE
REBECCA
MILLIPEDES
I
UNDERSTAND
ARE
VEGETARIAN
AND
THEREFORE
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
WILL
NOT
BITE
AND
ARE
NOT
POISONOUS
CENTIPEDES
ARE
CARNIVOROUS
AND
ALTHOUGH
I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
ABSOLUTE
KNOWLEDGE
ON
THIS
I
WOULD
TEND
TO
THINK
THAT
YOURE
IN
NO
DANGER
FROM
ANYTHING
BUT
A
CONCERTED
ASSAULT
BY
SEVERAL
MILLION
OF
THEM
G
NOT
SURE
OF
THIS
BUT
I
THINK
SOME
MILLIPEDES
CAUSE
A
TOXIC
REACTION
STING
SO
I
WOULD
NOT
ASSUME
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
DANGEROUS
MERELY
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
VEGETARIANISM
AFTER
ALL
WASPS
ARE
VEGETARIAN
TOO
