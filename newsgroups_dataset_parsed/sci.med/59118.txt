good
grief
again
why
the
anger
i
must
have
really
touched
a
raw
nerve
lets
see
i
had
symptoms
that
resisted
all
other
treatments
sporanox
totally
alleviated
them
within
one
week
hmmm
i
must
be
psychotic
yesss
thats
it
my
illness
was
all
in
my
mind
thanks
steve
for
your
correct
diagnosis
you
must
have
a
lot
of
experience
being
out
there
in
trenches
treating
hundreds
of
patients
a
week
thank
you
im
forever
in
your
debt

oops
gotta
run
the
men
in
white
coats
are
ready
to
take
me
away
haha
to
the
happy
home
where
i
can
go
twiddle
my
thumbs
basket
weave
and
moan
about
my
sinuses
ever
heard
of
something
called
the
placebo
effect
i
think
dyer
is
reacting
because
it
looks
to
be
yet
another
case
of
the
same
old
quackery
over
and
over
again
it
true
that
current
medical
knowledge
is
limited
but
do
you
realize
just
how
many
quacks
exist
eager
to
suck
your
its
playing
the
lottery
at
best
if
the
results
you
got
were
so
clear
and
obvious
would
you
mind
trying
a
little
experiment
to
see
if
it
is
true
it
would
be
quite
simple
have
sugar
pills
and
have
real
pills
take
one
set
for
one
week
and
the
other
set
for
another
week
without
knowing
which
ones
are
the
real
pills
then
at
the
end
of
the
weeks
compare
the
results
lets
say
youre
wife
would
know
which
are
the
real
ones
if
what
you
are
experiencing
is
true
there
should
be
a
marked
difference
between
each
week
