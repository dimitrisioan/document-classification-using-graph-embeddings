sounds
to
me
like
someone
was
pulling
your
leg
there
is
only
one
way
for
pregnancy
to
occur
intercourse
these
days
however
there
is
also
artificial
insemination
and
implantation
techniques
but
were
speaking
of
natural
acts
here
it
is
possible
for
pregnancy
to
occur
if
semen
is
deposited
just
outside
of
the
vagina
ie
coitus
interruptus
but
thats
about
at
far
as
you
can
get
through
clothes
no
way
better
go
talk
to
your
biology
teacher
what
is
the
likely
hood
of
conception
if
sperm
is
deposited
just
outside
the
vagina
ie
chance
hmmm
i
really
dont
know
probably
quite
low
overall
why
dont
we
get
a
couple
hundred
willing
couples
together
and
find
out
