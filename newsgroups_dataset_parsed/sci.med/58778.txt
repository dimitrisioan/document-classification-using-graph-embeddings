METHODOLOGY

LEE
LADY
WRITES
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
NOBEL
PRIZE
LEVEL
SCIENTIST
AND
A
MEDIOCRE
SCIENTIST
DOES
NOT
LIE
IN
THE
QUALITY
OF
THEIR
EMPIRICAL
METHODOLOGY
IT
DEPENDS
ON
THE
QUALITY
OF
THEIR
THINKING
IT
REALLY
BOTHERS
ME
THAT
SO
MANY
GRADUATE
STUDENTS
SEEM
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
SCIENCE
MERELY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
CONDUCTING
EMPIRICAL
STUDIES
AND
IM
ESPECIALLY
OFFENDED
BY
RUSSELL
TURPINS
REPEATED
ASSERTION
THAT
SCIENCE
AMOUNTS
TO
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
AVOIDING
MISTAKES
SIMPLY
AVOIDING
MISTAKES
DOESNT
GET
YOU
ANYWHERE
I
THINK
THAT
LEE
LADY
AND
I
ARE
TALKING
AT
CROSS
PURPOSES
ABOVE
LADY
SEEMS
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
CONTRAST
BETWEEN
GREAT
SCIENCE
THAT
MAKES
BIG
ADVANCES
IN
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
AND
MEDIOCRE
SCIENCE
THAT
MAKES
SMALLER
STEPS
IN
MOST
OF
THIS
THREAD
I
HAVE
BEEN
CONCERNED
WITH
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
WHAT
IS
SCIENCE
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
LEE
LADY
IS
CORRECT
WHEN
SHE
ASSERTS
THAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
EINSTEIN
AND
THE
AVERAGE
POSTDOC
PHYSICIST
IS
THE
QUALITY
OF
THEIR
THOUGHT
BUT
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
EINSTEIN
AND
A
GENIUS
WHO
WOULD
BE
A
GREAT
SCIENTIST
BUT
WHOSE
GREAT
THOUGHTS
ARE
SCIENTIFICALLY
SCREWY
SOME
WOULD
GIVE
VELIKOVSKY
OR
KORZYBSKI
AS
EXAMPLES
IF
YOU
DONT
LIKE
THESE
CHOOSE
YOUR
OWN
I
SAY
IT
IS
THE
SAME
AS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
MEDIOCRE
PHYSICIST
AND
THE
MEDIOCRE
PROPONENT
OF
QI
BOTH
EINSTEIN
AND
THE
MEDIOCRE
PHYSCISTS
HAVE
DISCIPLINED
THEIR
WORK
FROM
THE
CUMULATIVE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
HOW
PREVIOUS
RESEARCHERS
WENT
WRONG
BOTH
VELIKOVSKY
AND
THE
MEDIOCRE
PROPONENT
OF
QI
HAVE
FAILED
TO
DO
THIS
LET
ME
APPROACH
THIS
FROM
A
SECOND
DIRECTION
WHEN
ONE
IS
ASKED
TO
REVIEW
A
PAPER
FOR
A
JOURNAL
OR
CONFERENCE
THERE
ARE
MANY
KINDS
OF
CRITICISM
THAT
ONE
CAN
MAKE
ONE
KIND
OF
CRITICISM
IS
THAT
THE
WORK
IS
JUST
WRONG
OR
MISINFORMED
ANOTHER
KIND
OF
CRITICISM
IS
THAT
THE
WORK
WHILE
TECHNICALLY
CORRECT
IS
EITHER
NOT
IMPORTANT
OR
NOT
INTERESTING
THE
FIRST
DIFFERENCE
IS
THE
ONE
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
POINTING
TO
THE
SECOND
DIFFERENCE
IS
THE
ONE
THAT
LEE
LADY
SEEMS
TO
BE
DISCUSSING
IF
GOOD
EMPIRICAL
RESEARCH
WERE
DONE
AND
SHOWED
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
MERIT
TO
HOMEOPATHIC
REMEDIES
THIS
WOULD
CERTAINLY
BE
VALUABLE
INFORMATION
BUT
IT
WOULD
STILL
NOT
MEAN
THAT
HOMEOPATHY
QUALIFIES
AS
A
SCIENCE
THIS
IS
WHERE
YOU
AND
I
DISAGREE
WITH
TURPIN
I
HAVE
OFTEN
POINTED
OUT
THAT
FOR
HOMEOPATHY
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
SCIENTIFIC
WHAT
IS
NEEDED
IS
A
TEST
OF
ITS
THEORETICAL
CLAIMS
NOT
JUST
OF
SOME
OF
ITS
PROPOSED
REMEDIES
SIMILARLY
I
SUSPECT
THAT
TRADITIONAL
CHINESE
MEDICINE
HAS
MANY
REMEDIES
THAT
WORK
WHAT
IT
LACKS
AS
ONE
EXAMPLE
IS
ANY
EXPERIMENT
THAT
TESTS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
QI
IN
ORDER
TO
HAVE
SCIENCE
ONE
MUST
HAVE
A
THEORETICAL
STRUCTURE
THAT
MAKES
SENSE
NOT
A
MERE
COLLECTION
OF
EMPIRICALLY
VALIDATED
RANDOM
HYPOTHESES
CERTAINLY
A
THEORETICAL
STRUCTURE
THAT
MAKES
SENSE
IS
THE
GOAL
IN
AREAS
WHERE
WE
DO
NOT
YET
HAVE
THIS
I
SEE
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
FORMING
AND
TESTING
SMALLER
HYPOTHESES
LETS
FACE
IT
WE
CANNOT
ALWAYS
WAIT
FOR
AN
EINSTEIN
TO
COME
ALONG
AND
MAKE
EVERYTHING
CLEAR
FOR
US
SOMETIMES
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
ARE
NOT
EINSTEIN
HAVE
TO
PLUG
ALONG
AND
MAKE
SMALL
AMOUNTS
OF
PROGRESS
AS
BEST
WE
CAN
RUSSELL
