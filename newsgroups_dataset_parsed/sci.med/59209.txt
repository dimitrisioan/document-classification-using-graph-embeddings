re
great
post
was
re
candida
yeast
bloom
very
long
in
article

jon

writes
hate
to
wreck
your
elaborate
theory
but
steve
dyer
is
not
an
md
so
professional
jealosy
over
doctors
who
help
their
patients
with
nystatin
etc
cant
very
well
come
into
the
picture
steve
doesnt
have
any
patients
response
to
specificially
candida
albicans
and
i
showed
a
strong
positive
another
question
would
everybody
show
the
same
strong
positive
so
this
test
is
essentially
useless
and
assuming
it
is
true
that
candida
can
grow
yes
everyone
who
is
normal
does
that
we
use
candida
on
the
other
arm
when
we
put
a
tuberculin
test
on
if
people
dont
react
to
candida
we
assume
the
tb
test
was
not
conclusive
since
such
people
may
not
react
to
anything
all
normal
people
have
antibodies
to
candida
if
not
you
would
quickly
turn
into
a
fungus
ball
this
brings
up
an
interesting
observation
used
by
those
who
will
deny
and
reject
any
and
all
aspects
of
the
yeast
hypothesis
until
the
appropriate
studies
are
done
and
that
is
if
you
cant
observe
or
culture
the
yeast
bloom
in
the
gut
or
sinus
then
theres
no
way
to
diagnose
or
even
recognize
the
disease
and
i
know
they
realize
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
test
for
candida
overbloom
in
any
part
of
the
body
that
cannot
be
easily
observed
since
candida
is
everywhere
in
the
body
its
a
real
youve
just
discovered
one
of
the
requirements
for
a
good
quack
theory
find
something
that
no
one
can
disprove
and
then
write
a
book
saying
it
is
the
cause
of
whatever
since
no
one
can
disprove
it
you
can
rake
in
the
bucks
for
quite
some
time
i
have
often
wondered
what
an
md
with
chronic
gi
distress
or
sinus
problems
would
do
about
the
problem
that
he
tells
his
patients
is
a
nonexistent
syndrome
that
is
odd
isnt
it
why
do
you
suppose
it
is
that
mds
with
these
common
problems
dont
go
for
these
crazy
ideas
does
the
professional
jealosy
extend
to
suffering
in
silence
even
though
they
know
they
could
be
cured
if
they
just
followed
this
quack
book
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
gebcadredslpittedu
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
