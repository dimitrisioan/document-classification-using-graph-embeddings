RE
GREAT
POST
WAS
RE
CANDIDA
YEAST
BLOOM
VERY
LONG
IN

NORINGNETCOMCOM
JON
NORING
WRITES
IF
YOU
CANT
OBSERVE
OR
CULTURE
THE
YEAST
BLOOM
IN
THE
GUT
OR
SINUS
THEN
THERES
NO
WAY
TO
DIAGNOSE
OR
EVEN
RECOGNIZE
THE
DISEASE
AND
I
KNOW
THEY
REALIZE
THAT
IT
IS
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TEST
FOR
CANDIDA
OVERBLOOM
IN
ANY
PART
OF
THE
BODY
THAT
CANNOT
BE
EASILY
OBSERVED
SINCE
CANDIDA
IS
EVERYWHERE
IN
THE
BODY

WRITES
YOUVE
JUST
DISCOVERED
ONE
OF
THE
REQUIREMENTS
FOR
A
GOOD
QUACK
THEORY
FIND
SOMETHING
THAT
NO
ONE
CAN
DISPROVE
AND
THEN
WRITE
A
BOOK
SAYING
IT
IS
THE
CAUSE
OF
WHATEVER
SINCE
NO
ONE
CAN
DISPROVE
IT
YOU
CAN
RAKE
IN
THE
BUCKS
FOR
QUITE
SOME
TIME
I
HOPE
GORDON
BANKS
DID
NOT
MEAN
TO
IMPLY
THAT
NOTIONS
SUCH
AS
HARDTOSEE
CANDIDA
INFECTIONS
CAUSING
VARIOUS
PROBLEMS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
INVESTIGATED
MANY
RESEARCHERS
HAVE
MADE
BREAKTHROUGHS
BY
FIGURING
OUT
HOW
TO
INVESTIGATE
THINGS
THAT
WERE
PREVIOUSLY
THOUGHT
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TEST
FOR
INDEED
I
WOULD
BE
SURPRISED
IF
CANDIDA
OVERBLOOM
WERE
SUCH
A
PHENOMENA
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
CANDIDA
WOULD
PRODUCE
SIGNATURE
BYPRODUCTS
WHOSE
MEASURE
WOULD
THEN
SET
A
LOWER
BOUND
ON
THE
EXTENT
OF
RECENT
INFECTION
I
REALIZE
THIS
MIGHT
GET
QUITE
TRICKY
AND
DIFFICULT
PROBABLY
EXPENSIVE
AND
LIKELY
INCONVENIENT
OR
UNCOMFORTABLE
TO
THE
SUBJECTS
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE
