RE
OPINIONS
ON
ALLERGY
HAY
FEVER
SHOTS
IN
ARTICLE
ERIC
JACQUIER
SAYS
FROM
NOW
ON
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
SHOTS
PER
WEEK
FOR
MONTHS
FOLLOWED
BY
SHOT
PER
MONTH
OR
SO
EACH
SHOT
COSTS
TALKING
ABOUT
SOARING
COSTS
AND
THE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
I
WOULD
CALL
THAT
A
RACKET
WE
ARE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
RARE
AMAZONIAN
GRASSES
HERE
BUT
THE
GARBAGE
WHICH
GROWS
BEHIND
THE
DOCTORS
OFFICE
APART
FROM
THIS
ISSUE
I
WAS
SOMEWHAT
DISAPPOINTED
TO
FIND
OUT
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
KEEP
GETTING
THE
SHOTS
FOREVER
IS
THAT
RIGHT
YOU
MIGHT
LOOK
FOR
AN
ALLERGY
DOCTOR
IN
YOUR
AREA
WHO
USES
SUBLINGUAL
DROPS
INSTEAD
OF
SHOTS
FOR
TREATMENT
YOU
ARE
GIVEN
A
SMALL
BOTTLE
OF
ANTIGENS
DROPS
ARE
PLACED
UNDER
THE
TONGUE
FOR
MINUTES
MY
ALLERGY
TO
BERMUDA
GRASS
WAS
NEUTRALIZED
THIS
WAY
THROUGHOUT
THE
TREATMENT
PROCESS
I
HAD
TO
RETURN
TO
THE
DOCTORS
OFFICE
EVERY
MONTH
FOR
RETESTING
AND
A
NEW
BOTTLE
OF
ANTIGENS
AFTER
THE
ALLERGY
WAS
COMPLETELY
NEUTRALIZED
A
BOTTLE
OF
MAINTENANCE
ANTIGENS
LASTS
ME
ABOUT
MONTHS
THE
SUBLINGUAL
DROPS
ARE
THEN
TAKEN
TIMES
PER
WEEK
AND
COSTS
SO
THE
COST
IS
LESS
THAN
SHOTS
AND
IT
IS
MORE
CONVENIENT
JUST
TO
TAKE
THE
DROPS
AT
HOME
