THIS
WAS
KNOWN
LONG
AGO
BRAIN
PRODUCES
AND
USES
SOME
MSG
NATURALLY
BUT
NOT
IN
DOSES
IT
IS
SERVED
AT
SOME
CHINESE
PLACES
HAVING
SAID
THAT
I
MIGHT
ADD
THAT
IN
MHO
MSG
DOES

ENHANCE
FLAVOR
ENOUGHF
FOR
ME
TO
MISS
IT
WHEN
I
GO
TO
CHINESE
PLACES
I
ORDER
FOOD
WITHOUT
MSG
GOOS

WILL
DO
IT
FOR
YOU
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
FOOD
PARTICULARLY
THE
SOUPS
ARE
PREPARED
IN
A
BIG

ITS
PRETTY
HARD
TO
FIND
OUT
IF
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
OR
NOT
