recently
ive
come
upon
a
body
of
literature
which
promotes
colon
cleansing
as
a
vital
aid
to
preventive
medicine
through
nutrition
no
doubt
the
scimed
folks
are
getting
out
their
flamethrowers
im
rather
certain
that
the
information
you
got
was
not
medical
literature
in
the
accepted
academicscientific
journals
so
the
righteous
among
them
will
no
doubt
jump
on
that
also
insofar
as
it
doesnt
conform
to
the
accepted
medical
presumption
that
it
just
doesnt
matter
what
you
eat
and
that
we
can
think
of
the
gi
tract
as
a
black
box
in
which
nothing
ever
goes
wrong
except
for
maybe
cancer
and
ulcers
the
righteous
will
no
doubt
jump
on
that
too
then
therell
be
the
ones
who
call
your
doctor
a
raving
quack
even
though
he
like
linus
pauling
is
lucid
and
robust
well
into
his
ninetiesbut
nevermind
about
that
he
shouldnt
charge
for
his
equipment
and
supplies
since
theyre
no
doubt
not
approved
by
the
fda
of
course
with
fda
approval
an
md
or
pharmaceutical
company
can
charge
whatever
they
can
get
for
such
safe
and
effective
treatments
as
thalidomide
but
nevermind
about
that
either
unfortunately
you
dared
to
step
into
the
sacred
turf
of
netmedical
discussion
without
a
credential
and
without
understanding
that
the
righteous
among
them
will
make
certain
that
you
are
suitably
denounced
before
dismissing
you
as
a
fool
but
maybe
somebody
without
such
a
huge
chip
on
their
shoulder
will
send
you
some
reasonable
responses
by
email
oh
yes
i
did
have
a
point
a
few
years
ago
an
md
with
a
thriving
practice
in
a
very
wealthy
part
of
silicon
valley
once
recommended
that
i
take
such
treatments
to
clear
up
a
skin
condition
not
through
his
office
i
might
add
although
im
sure
thats
not
conclusive
it
was
sure
an
unusual
prescription
the
bacteria
in
your
gut
are
important
but
colonic
flushes
are
not
the
way
to
improve
gut
function
each
person
has
almost
a
unique
mix
of
bacteria
in
hisher
gut
diet
affects
this
mix
as
does
the
use
of
antibiotics
a
diet
change
is
a
much
better
way
to
alter
the
players
in
your
gut
than
is
colonic
flushes
cross
contamination
has
been
a
real
problem
in
some
of
the
outfits
that
do
this
treatment
since
the
equipment
is
not
always
cleaned
as
well
as
it
should
be
between
patient
treatments
dental
drills
have
me
a
little
concerned
about
hiv
infection
and
ive
picked
a
dentist
that
uses
both
chemical
and
autoclave
sterilization
of
his
instrumentsmore
clostly
but
much
safer
full
sterile
technique
is
also
used
just
like
that
practiced
in
an
ormask
gloves
and
gowns
worn
and
disposed
of
between
patients
each
visit
costs
me
dollars
more
than
the
standard
and
customary
fee
so
i
have
to
pay
it
out
of
pocket
his
much
higher
fees
do
not
drive
away
patients
i
can
not
think
of
any
good
reason
why
someone
should
subject
themselves
to
this
colonic
flush
procedure
for
very
little
if
any
benefit
you
subject
yourself
to
hepatitis
cholera
parasitic
disease
and
even
hiv
just
ask
yourself
why
someone
might
resort
to
this
kind
of
treatment
could
they
be
having
gi
distress
could
this
distress
be
due
to
a
pathogenic
organism
could
i
get
this
organism
if
the
equipment
is
not
cleaned
properly
between
patients
do
i
really
want
to
take
this
risk
food
for
thought
