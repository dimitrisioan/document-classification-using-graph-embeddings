WRITES
I
REMEMBER
HEARING
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
ABOUT
A
NEW
THERAPY
FOR
HYPERACTIVITY
WHICH
INVOLVED
AGGRESSIVELY
ELIMINATING
ARTIFICIAL
COLORING
AND
FLAVORING
FROM
THE
DIET
THE
THEORY
WHICH
WAS
BACKED
UP
BY
INTERESTING
ANECDOTAL
RESULTS
IS
THAT
CERTAIN
PEOPLE
ARE
JUST
WAY
MORE
SENSITIVE
TO
THESE
CHEMICALS
THAN
OTHER
PEOPLE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
ANY
CONNECTION
BEING
MADE
WITH
SEIZURES
BUT
IT
CERTAINLY
COULDNT
HURT
TO
TRY
AN
ALLNATURAL
DIET
YEAH
THE
FEINGOLD
DIET
IS
A
LOAD
OF
CRAP
CHILDREN
DIAGNOSED

WHO

PLACED
ON
THIS
DIET

NO
IMPROVEMENT
IN
THEIR
INTELLECTUAL
AND
SOCIAL
SKILLS
WHICH
IN
FACT
CONTINUE
TO
DECLINE
OF

THE
PARENTS
WHO
ARE
ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT
THIS
APPROACH
LAP
IT
UP
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
THEIR
CHILDRENS
DEVELOPMENT
SO
MUCH
FOR
THE
VALUE
OF
INTERESTING
ANECDOTAL
RESULTS
PEOPLE
WILL
BELIEVE
ANYTHING
IF
THEY
