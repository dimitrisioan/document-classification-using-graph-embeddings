hi
it
started
to
hurt
when
i
lay
on
my
right
side
and
then
it
hurt
no
matter
what
position
i
was
in
next
i
noticed
that
when
i
ate
greasy
or
fatty
foods
i
felt
like
my
entire
abdomen
had
turned
to
stone
and
the
pain
in
the
area
got
worse
however
if
i
ate
sauerkraut
or
vinegar
or
something
to
cut
the
fat
it
wasnt
as
much
of
a
problem
so
the
doctor
says
i
have
cholistatis
and
that
i
should
avoid
fatty
foods
this
makes
sense
and
because
i
was
already
aware
of
what
seemed
to
me
this
cause
and
effect
relationship
i
have
been
avoiding
these
foods
on
my
own
but
im
still
able
to
eat
foods
with
ricotta
cheese
for
instance
and
other
low
fat
foods
but
doc
wants
me
to
be
on
a
nonfat
diet
this
means
no
meat
except
fish
and
chicken
wo
skin
i
do
this
anyway
no
nuts
fried
food
cheese
etc
i
am
allowed
skim
milk
she
said
i
should
avoid
anything
sweet
eg
bananas
also
i
must
only
have
one
serving
of
something
high
in
carbohydrates
a
day
potatoes
pasta
rice
she
said
i
cant
even
cook
vegetables
in
a
little
bit
of
oil
and
that
i
should
eat
vegetables
raw
or
steamed
im
concerned
because
i
understand
you
need
to
have
some
fat
in
your
diet
to
help
in
the
digestive
process
and
if
g
for
one
week
she
probably
wants
to
see
how
you
react
to
the
diet
if
it
changes
anything
you
can
live
on
the
diet
but
you
need
to
up
your
nonfat
calories
where
before
you
had
a
pat
of
butter
now
you
need
a
medium
apple
probably
microwave
cooked
smaller
meals
but
more
of
them
not
terrific
amounts
of
meat
its
hard
to
digest
anyway
first
even
fish
fowl
and
breads
have
fat
second
the
body
will
make
fat
out
of
carbohydrates
if
it
needs
them
third
your
body
like
most
peoples
wasnt
bred
to
live
on
a
high
fat
modern
diet
if
you
read
texts
about
ancient
and
primative
people
you
will
read
about
the
luxury
of
eating
fat
how
people
enjoyed
it
this
was
because
it
was
so
rare
even
cows
didnt
put
out
nearly
the
amount
of
butterfat
in
milk
that
they
do
now
for
comfort
and
to
make
the
carbohydrate
meal
last
longer
eat
pasta
or
rice
which
give
their
calories
up
slowly
rather
than
bread
or
corn
maybe
smaller
meals
as
you
may
be
getting
less
room
in
the
stomach
area
is
the
baby
still
coming
up
is
it
starting
to
push
or
rub
under
your
ribs
how
tight
are
your
clothes
you
shouldnt
be
wearing
any
clothing
that
compresses
your
middle
be
sure
not
to
suck
in
your
stomach
when
sitting
again
it
will
put
pressure
on
the
digestive
tract
try
laying
on
your
sides
back
and
stay
in
reclining
positions
for
the
many
hours
you
are
being
inactive
easier
on
your
legs
circulation
as
well
you
might
try
letting
the
baby
turn
or
at
least
not
be
forced
under
the
ribs
during
the
last
months
when
you
are
shortwaisted
its
easy
for
that
baby
to
end
up
right
under
the
diaphram
especially
if
you
have
tight
abdominal
muscles
if
i
had
my
second
one
to
do
over
again
i
think
id
have
tried
to
loosen
up
since
he
didnt
turn
sideways
until
late
and
the
relief
was
enormous
maybe
this
doctor
does
have
a
thing
about
weight
gain
in
pregnancy
or
maybe
she
just
nags
all
her
patients
this
way
especially
if
shes
young
but
this
gallbladderwhatever
problem
that
might
be
coming
up
is
something
to
be
avoided
if
possible
you
dont
want
to
become
ill
with
it
while
you
are
pregnant
if
you
are
lucky
you
can
work
on
getting
rid
of
it
after
the
baby
it
is
said
that
doctors
have
less
gallbadder
surgery
than
the
rest
of
the
population
a
good
part
of
it
is
that
they
are
willing
to
do
the
dieting
etc
that
helps
them
avoid
surgery
also
i
dont
think
the
surgery
lets
a
person
go
back
to
eating
a
high
fat
diet
nausea
etc
can
vary
from
person
to
person
and
with
each
pregnancy
my
first
pregnancy
was
miserable
during
the
second
i
had
very
little
trouble
some
articles
have
said
that
women
with
nausea
had
a
statistically
better
chance
of
carrying
their
baby
grain
of
salt
here
good
luck
