emphesema
and
a
doctor
wants
to
try
it
on
him
we
are
wondering
if
is
there
any
evidence
edta
chelation
therapy
is
beneficial
for
his
condition
or
any
condition
what
possible
side
effects
are
there
how
can
they
be
mimimized
please

edtachelation
therapy
has
been
used
by
some
physicians
to
try
to
remove
calcium
from
calcified
plaques
in
the
arterial
systemnot
approved
for
such
use
there
is
also
the
possibility
that
lung
tissue
in
patients
with
lung
disease
has
become
calcifiedchest
xrays
would
show
this
there
are
side
effects
to
the
use
of
edta
because
it
is
not
specific
for
calciumit
also
binds
other
minerals
i
think
that
there
have
been
some
deaths
when
edta
chelation
therapy
has
been
used
because
of
mineral
imbalances
that
were
not
detected
and
corrected
in
animal
studies
the
best
way
to
remove
calcium
from
plaques
in
rabbits
was
to
supplement
the
rabbits
with
vitamin
c
and
magnesiumrabbits
already
synthesize
their
own
vitamin
c
the
extra
vitamin
c
was
given
in
their
diets
to
help
the
magnesium
displace
the
calcium
from
the
plaques
the
calcification
process
that
occurs
in
both
plaques
and
the
lung
probably
can
be
prevented
if
magnesium
is
used
in
supplemental
form
most
patietns
with
calcium
deposits
are
found
to
be
deficient
in
calcium
