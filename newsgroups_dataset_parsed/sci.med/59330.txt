DOES
ANYONE
HERE
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
CHELATION
THERAPY
USING
EDTA
MY
UNCLE
HAS
EMPHESEMA
AND
A
DOCTOR
WANTS
TO
TRY
IT
ON
HIM
WE
ARE
WONDERING
IF
IS
THERE
ANY
EVIDENCE
EDTA
CHELATION
THERAPY
IS
BENEFICIAL

HIS
CONDITION

WHAT

I
THINK
THAT
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SOME
DEATHS
WHEN
EDTA
CHELATION
THERAPY
HAS
BEEN
USED
BECAUSE
OF
MINERAL
IMBALANCES
THAT
WERE
NOT
DETECTED
AND
CORRECTED
IN

THE
BEST
WAY
TO
REMOVE
CALCIUM
FROM
PLAQUES
IN
RABBITS
WAS
TO
SUPPLEMENT
THE
RABBITS
WITH
VITAMIN
C
AND
MAGNESIUMRABBITS
ALREADY
SYNTHESIZE

THE
EXTRA
VITAMIN

WAS
GIVEN
IN
THEIR
DIETS
TO
HELP
THE
MAGNESIUM
DISPLACE
THE
CALCIUM
FROM
THE
PLAQUES
THE
CALCIFICATION
PROCESS
THAT
OCCURS
IN
BOTH
PLAQUES
AND
THE

PROBABLY
CAN
BE
PREVENTED
