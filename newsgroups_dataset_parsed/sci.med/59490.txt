I
PERSONALLY
WOULDNT
BE
SO
QUICK
AND
TAKE
THAT
NEJM
ARTICLE
ON
KIDNEY
STONES
AS
GOSPEL
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
WOULD
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHO
SPONSORED
THAT
STUDY
I
HAVE
SEEN
TOO
MANY
NUTRITION
BULLETINS
OVER
THE
YEARS
FROM
LOCAL
NEWSPAPERS
MAGAZINES
TO
TVGUIDE
WITH
DISCLAIMERS
ON
THE
BOTTOM
INFORMING
US
THAT
THIS
GREAT
HEALTH
NEWS
WAS
BROUGHT
TO
US
COMPLIMENTS
OF
THE
DAIRY
INDUSTRIES
THERE
ARE
OF
COURSE
NUMEROUS
OTHER

THRIVE

CREATED
FROM
THE
SUPPOSEDLY
ENORMOUS

ALL
THE

IN

ANALYSED

DIDNT
SAY
THAT
IT

ARE

PERHAPS
IT
WONT
BE
LONG
BEFORE
ANOTHER
STUDY
COMES
UP
WITH
THE
EXACT
OPPOSITE
FINDINGS
A
CURIOUS
PHENOMENON
WITH
RESEARCHERS
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
OFTENTIMES
JUST
PLAIN

IT

RATIOS
ARE
IN
MY
OPINION
STILL
THE
MOST
RELIABLE
INDICATORS
FOR
THE
CAUSE
TREATMENT
AND
PREVENTION
OF
KIDNEY
STONES
I
FOR
ONE
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
RECOMMEND
THE
MOST
LOGICAL
CHANGES
IN
ONES
DIET
OR
THROUGH
SUPPLEMENTATION
TO
COUNTERACT
OR
PREVENT
KIDNEY
STONES
OF
EITHER
TYPE
AND
THEY
DEFINITELY
WONT
INCLUDE
AN
INCREASE
IN
CALCIUM
IF
THE
STONES
HAVE
BEEN
IDENTIFIED

YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT
NOT
ALL
KIDNEY
STONES
HAVE
CALCIUM
AND
NOT
ALL
CALCIUM
STONES
ARE
CALCIUMOXALATE
BUT
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
ARE
CALCIUM
OXALATE
CALCIUM
IS
JUST
ONE
PIECE
OF
THE
PUZZLE
I
CITED
THAT
NEJM
ARTICLE
AS
A
WAY
OF
POINTING
OUT
TO
SOME
OF
THE
PHYSICIANS
IN
THIS
GROUP
THAT
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
IS
USED
IN
MEDICINE
ALWAYS
HAS
BEEN
AND
PROBABLY
ALWAYS
WILL
BE
IF
ONE
USES
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
THERE
IS
A
CHANCE
THAT
YOU
WILL
BE
WRONG
AS
LONG
AS
THE
ERROR
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
CAUSE
A
LOT
OF
DAMAGE
WHATS
THE
BIG
DEALWHY
CALL
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
GIVES
ANTIFUNGALS

A
MINERAL
PROFILE
RUN
IN
A
CLINICAL
CHEMISTRY
LAB
BALANCE
IS
MUCH
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
THE
DIETARY
INTAKE
OF
CALCIUM
I
KNOW
THAT
YOU
USE
AN
ELECTRICAL
CONDUCTANCE
TECHNIQUE
TO
MEASURE
MINERAL
BALANCE
IN
THE
BODY
I
KNOW
THAT
YOU
DONT
THINK
THAT
THE
SERUM
LEVELS
FOR
MINERALS
ARE
VERY
USEFULI
AGREE
IF
I
CAN
GET
A
GOOD

I
