re
altpsychoactives
fyii
just
posted
this
on
altpsychoactives
as
a
response
to
what
the
group
is
for
a
note
to
the
users
of
altpsychoactives
this
group
was
originally
a
takeoff
from
scimed
the
reason
for
the
formation
of
this
group
was
to
discuss
prescription
psychoactive
drugssuch
as
antidepressentstricyclics
prozac
lithiumetc
antipsychoticsmelleralsp
etc
ocd
drugsanafranil
etc
and
so
on
and
so
forth
it
didnt
take
long
for
this
group
to
degenerate
into
a
psudo
altdrugs
atmosphere
thats
to
bad
for
most
of
the
serious
folks
that
wanted
to
start
this
group
in
the
first
place
have
left
and
gone
back
to
scimed
where
you
have
to
cypher
through
hundreds
of
unrelated
articles
to
find
psychoactive
data
it
was
also
to
discuss
reallife
experiences
and
side
effects
of
the
above
mentioned
oh
well
i
had
unsubscribed
to
this
group
for
some
time
and
i
decided
to
check
it
today
to
see
if
anything
had
changednopesame
old
nine
or
ten
crap
articles
that
this
group
was
never
intended
for
i
think
it
is
very
hard
to
have
a
meaningfull
group
without
it
being
moderatedtoo
bad
oh
well
obviously
no
one
really
cares
bill
claussen
would
anyone
be
interested
in
starting
a
similar
moderated
group
