RE
BARBECUED
FOODS
AND
HEALTH
RISK
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
CARCINOGENIC
THAT
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
LEGAL
IN
THE
US
I
THINK
THAT
NATURALLY
OCCURING
SUBSTANCES
EXCLUDING
CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES
ARE
PRETTY
MUCH
UNREGULATED
IN
TERMS
OF
THEIR
USE
AS
FOOD
FOOD
ADDITIVES
OR
OTHER
CONSUMPTION
ITS
ONLY
WHEN
THE
CHEMISTS
CONCOCT
SP
AN
INGREDIENT
THAT
IT
FALLS
UNDER
FDA
REGULATIONS
OTHERWISE
IF
THEY
REALLY
LOOKED
CLOSELY
THEY
WOULD
FIND
A
REASON
TO
BAN
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
HOW
IN
THE
WORLD
DO
YOU
SUPPOSE
ITS
LEGAL
TO
CONSUME
TOBACCO
PRODUCTS
WHICH
PROBABLY
SHOULD
BE
BANNED
NO
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
CALLED
THE
DELANY
AMENDMENT
WHICH
MAKES
CARCINOGENIC
FOOD
ADDITIVES
ILLEGAL
IN
ANY
AMOUNT
THIS
WAS
PASSED
BY
CONGRESS
IN
THE
BEFORE
STUFF
LIKE
MASS
SPECTROMETRY
BECAME
AVAILABLE
WHICH
INCREASED
DETECTABLE
LEVELS
OF
SUBSTANCES
BY
A
COUPLE
ORDERS
OF
MAGNITUDE
THIS
IS
WHY
THINGS
LIKE
CYCLAMATES
AND
RED
WERE
BANNED
THEY
ARE
VERY
WEAKLY
CARCINOGENIC
IN
HUGE
QUANTITIES
IN
RATS
SO
UNDER
THE
ACT
THEY
ARE
BANNED
THIS
ALSO
APPLIES
TO
NATURAL
CARCINOGENS
SOME
OF
YOU
MIGHT
REMEMBER
A
TIME
BACK
IN
THE
WHEN
ROOT
BEER
SUDDENLY
STOPPED
TASTING
SO
GOOD
AND
NEVER
TASTED
SO
GOOD
AGAIN
THAT
WAS
THE
TIME
WHEN
SAFROLE
WAS
BANNED
THIS
IS
THE
ACTIVE
FLAVORING
INGREDIENT
IN
SASSAFRAS
LEAVES
IF
IT
WERE
POSSIBLE
TO
MARKET
A
ROOT
BEER
GOOD
LIKE
THE
OLD
DAYS
SOMEONE
WOULD
DO
IT
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
MONEY
THE
FACT
THAT
NO
ONE
DOES
IT
INDICATES
THAT
ENFORCEMENT
IS
STILL
IN
EFFECT
AN
ODD
EXCEPTION
TO
THE
RULE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
PRODUCT
KNOWN
AS
GUMBO
FILE
THIS
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
COARSELY
GROUND
DRIED
SASSAFRAS
LEAVES
THIS
IS
NOT
ONLY
A
NATURAL
PRODUCT
BUT
A
NATURAL
PRODUCT
STILL
IN
ITS
NATURAL
FORM
SO
MAYBE
THATS
HOW
THEY
EVADE
DELANY
OR
MAYBE
A
SPECIAL
EXEMPTION
WAS
MADE
TO
APPEASE
POWERFUL
LOUISIANA
DEMOCRATS
