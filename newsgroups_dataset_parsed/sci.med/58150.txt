EXPLAIN
I
THOUGHT
THERE
WERE
TYPES
OF
CONES
EQUIVALENT
TO
RGB
YOURE
BASICALLY
RIGHT
BUT
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
JUST
TYPES
ONE
IS
SENSITIVE
TO
RED
AND
GREEN
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
SENSITIVE
TO
BLUE
AND
YELLOW
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
TWO
MOST
COMMON
KINDS
OF
COLORBLINDNESS
ARE
REDGREEN
AND
BLUEYELLOW
YES
I
REMEMBER
THAT
NOW
WELL
IN
THAT
CASE
THE
CONES
ARE
INDEED
COLOR
SENSITIVE
CONTRARY
TO
WHAT
THE
ORIGINAL
RESPONDENT
HAD
CLAIMED
IM
NOT
SURE
WHO
THE
ORIGINAL
RESPONDENT
WAS
BUT
TO
REITERATE
CONES
RESPOND
TO
PARTICULAR
PORTIONS
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
JUST
AS
RODS
RESPOND
TO
CERTAIN
PARTS
OF
THE
VISIBLE
SPECTRUM
BLUEGREEN
IN
OUR
CASE
REDDISH
IN
CERTAIN
AMPHIBIA
JUST
AS
THE
HOSESHOE
CRAB
LIMULUS
POLYPHEMUS
PHOTORECEPTORS
RESPOND
TO
A
CERTAIN
PORTION
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
ETC
IT
IS
A
COMMON
MISCONCEPTION
TO
CONFOUND
WAVELENGTH
SPECIFICITY
WITH
BEING
COLOR
SENSITIVE
HOWEVER
THE
TWO
ARE
NOT
SYNONYMOUS
SO
IN
SUM
AND
TO
BEAT
A
DEAD
HORSE
WHEN
THE
OUTPUTS
OF
A
CONE
ARE
MATCHED
FOR
NUMBER
OF
ABSORBED
PHOTONS
IRRESPECTIVE
OF
THE
ABSORBED
PHOTONS
WAVELENGTH
THE
CONE
OUTPUTS
ARE
INDISTINGUISHABLE
CONES
ARE
SIMPLY
DETECTORS
WITH
DIFFERENT
SPECTRAL
SENSITIVITIES
AND
ARE
NOT
ANY
MORE
COLOR
SENSITIVE
THAN
ARE
RODS
OMMATIDIA
OR
OTHER
PHOTORECEPTORS
COLOR
VISION
ARISES
BECAUSE
OUTPUTS
OF
RECEPTORS
WHICH
SAMPLE
DIFFERENT
PARTS
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
CONES
IN
THIS
CASE
ARE
PROCESSED
CENTRALLY
THE
HANDWAVE
IS
INTENTIONAL
IVE
WORKED
AND
PUBLISHED
RESEARCH
ON
RODS
AND
CONES
FOR
OVER
YEARS
SO
THE
ADHERENCE
TO
THE
BELIEF
THAT
CONES
CAN
DETECT
COLOR
IS
FRUSTRATING
BUT
DONT
TAKE
MY
WORD
FOR
IT
IM
