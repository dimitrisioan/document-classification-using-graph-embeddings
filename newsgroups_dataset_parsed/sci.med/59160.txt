HIS
MAKING

AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE

TO
A
STUDY
CONDUCTED
AT
THE
EASTERN
VIRGINIA
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
IN
ORDER
TO
BACK
UP
HIS
COMMENT
THAT
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF

THAT
MSG
A
FLAVOR
ENHANCER
IN
CHINESE

OTHER
ASIAN
CUISINES
AS
WELL
AS
IN
MANY

CAUSES
HEADACHES
WHAT
HE
DOES
NOT
MAKE
REFERENCE
TO
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
STUDY
WAS
PERFORMED
NOT
ON
HUMANS
BUT
ON
RABBITS
ONE
OF
THE
RESEARCHERS
WHO
CONDUCTED
THE
STUDY
PHARMACOLOGIST
PATRICIA
WILLIAMS
PHD
SAYS
IT
CERTAINLY
IS
CONCEIVABLE
THAT
A
SMALL
MINORITY
OF
PEOPLE
ARE
SENSITIVE
ENOUGH
TO
MSG
TO
GET
HEADACHES
FROM
IT
BUT
SHE
EXPLAINS
THE
SHOW
PROBABLY
OVEREMPHASIZED
THE
EXTENT
OF
THE
PROBLEM
A
SECOND
LAPSE
COMES
WITH
MENTION
OF
DR
JOHN
OLNEY
A
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY
SCHOOL
OF
MEDICINE
WHO
MR
BRADLEY
REMARKS
SAYS
THAT
HIS
YEARS
OF
RESEARCH
WITH
LABORATORY
ANIMALS
SHOWS
MSG
IS
A
HAZARD
FOR
DEVELOPING
YOUNGSTERS
BECAUSE
IT
POSES
A
THREAT
OF
IRREVERSIBLE
BRAIN
DAMAGE
DR
OLNEYS
RESEARCH
WITH
LAB
ANIMALS
DOES
NOT
SHOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HUMAN
YOUNGSTERS
IN
FACT
ONLY
UNDER
EXTREME
CIRCUMSRTANCES
DID
DR
OLNEYS
EXPERIMENTS
EVER
BRING
ABOUT
ANY
BRAIN
DAMAGE
WHEN
HE
INJECTED
EXTREMELY
HIGH
DOSES
OF
MSG
INTO
RODENTS
COMPLETELY
BYPASSING
THEIR
DIGESTIVE
TRACTS
AND
ENTERING
THEIR
BLOODSTREAMS
MORE
DIRECTLY
AND
WHEN
HE
USED
TUBES
TO
FORCEFEED
HUGE
AMOUNTS
OF
THE
SUBSTANCE
TO
VERY
YOUNG
ANIMALS
ON
AN
EMPTY
STOMACH
OF
COURSE
NEITHER
OF
THOSE
PROCEDURES
OCCURS
WITH
HUMANS
THEY
SIMPLY
TAKE
IN
MSG
WITH
FOOD
AND
MOST
OF
WHAT
THEY
TAKE
IN
IS
BROKEN
DOWN
BY
ENZYMES
IN
THE
WALL
OF
THE
SMALL
INTESTINE
SO
THAT
VERY
LITTLE
REACHES
THE
BLOODSTREAM
MUCH
TO
LITTLE
IN
FACT
FOR
HUMAN
BLOOD
LEVELS
OF
MSG
TO
COME
ANYWHERE
NEAR
THE
HIGH
CONCENTRATIONS
FOUND
IN
DR
OLNEYS
LAB
ANIMALS
THE
WORLD
HEALTH
ORGANIZATION
APPEARS
TO
BE
VERY
MUCH
AWARE
OF
THAT
FACT
AND
SO
DOES
THE
EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
SCIENTIFIC
COMMITTEE
FOR
FOODBOTH
AFTER
EXAMINING
NUMEROUS
STUDIES
HAVE
CONCLUDED
THAT
MSG
IS
SAFE
THEIR
DETERMINATION
MAKES
SENSE
CONSIDERING
THAT
MSG
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
PROVEN
TO
CAUSE
ALL
THE
SYMPTOMS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
ATTRIBUTED
TO
IT

WHENEVER
WE

THAT

THE
