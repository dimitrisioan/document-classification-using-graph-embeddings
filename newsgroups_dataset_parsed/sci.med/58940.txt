WRITES
SOME
RECENT
POSTINGS
REMIND
ME
THAT
I
HAD
READ
ABOUT
RISKS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
BARBECUING
OF
FOODS
NAMELY
THAT
CARCINOGENS
ARE
GENERATED
IS
THIS
A
VALID
CONCERN
IF
SO
IS
IT
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
SMOKE
OR
THE
ELEVATED
TEMPERATURES
IS
IT
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
COOKING
ELEMENTS
WOOD
OR
CHARCOAL
VS
LAVA
ROCKS

WISH
TO
KNOW

THE
GREATEST
HAZARD
OF
BARBECUING
IS
THAT
THE
COOK
WILL
NOT
USE
ENOUGH
CAUTION
AND
GET
BURNED
SOME
PEOPLE
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
BARBECUING
ITSELF
IS
DANGEROUS
BECAUSE
THE
SMOKE
WHICH
IS
ABSORBED
BY
THE
MEAT
CONTAINS
BENZOPYRENE
WHICH
IN
ITS
PURE
FORM
HAS
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
CAUSE
CANCER
IN
LABORATORY
ANIMALS
HOWEVER
IN
ORDER
TO
EXPERIENCE
THE
SAME
RESULTS
PEOPLE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
CONSUME
UNREALISTICALLY
LARGE
QUANTITIES
OF
BARBECUED
MEAT
AT
A
TIME
RICH
YOUNG
THESE
ARE
NOT
KODAKS
