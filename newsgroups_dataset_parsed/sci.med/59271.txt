WRITES
WHICH
WAS
WHY
I
STARTED
CHECKING
EVERY
TIME
I
GOT
SICK
AND
EVERY
TIME
I
GOT
SICK
MSG
WAS
SOMEHOW
INVOLVED
IN
ONE
OF
THE
FOOD
PRODUCTS
WHICH
POINTS
UP
THE
STUDIES
MADE
BY
AMATEURS
DID
YOU
ALSO
CHECK
EVERY
TIME
YOU
DID
NOT
GET
SICK
NO
YOU
SAY
WHY
NOT
CHECK
EVERY
THING
YOU
EAT
WHEN
YOU
DONT
GET
SICK
AND
FIND
OUT
HOW
MUCH
MSG
YOURE
ACTUALLY
CONSUMING
ALL
THATS
NEEDED
NOW
IS
THAT
FINAL
STEP
A
DOUBLEBLIND
STUDY
DONE

SOME
SAY

SAY
ITS
MORE
LIKE

LETS
SAY
THAT
ITS
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
TESTED
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
ALSO
I
KNOW
I
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
IT
AND
I
WOULDNT
VOLUNTEER
FOR
A
TEST
IF
YOU
KNEW
ENOUGH
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
TEST
WAS
ABOUT
TO
DECIDE
THAT
YOU
DIDNT
WANT
TO
PARTICIPATE
BECAUSE
IT
INVOLVED
MSG
YOUDVE
ALREADY
MADE
YOURSELF
INELIGIBLE
SINCE
MSG
IS
DETECTABLE
BY
TASTE
HOW
CAN
ANYBODY
BE
SO
CLUELESS
AS
TO
WHAT
DOUBLE
