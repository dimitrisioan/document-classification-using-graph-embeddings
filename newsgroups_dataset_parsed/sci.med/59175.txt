RE
OPINIONS
ON
ALLERGY
HAY
FEVER
SHOTS
I
HAD
ALLERGY
SHOTS
FOR
ABOUT
FOUR
YEARS
STARTING
AS
A
SOPHOMORE
IN
HIGH
SCHOOL
BEFORE
THAT
I
USED
TO
GET
BLOODY
NOSES
NIGHTTIME
ASTHMA
ATTACKS
AND
EYES
SO
ITCHY
I
COULDNT
GET
TO
SLEEP
AFTER
ABOUT
MONTHS
ON
THE
SHOTS
MOST
OF
THOSE
SYMPTOMS
WERE
GONE
AND
THEY
HAVENT
COME
BACK
I
STOPPED
GETTING
THE
SHOTS
DUE
MORE
TO
LAZINESS
THAN
PLANNING
IN
COLLEGE
MY
ALLERGIES
GOT
A
LITTLE
WORSE
AFTER
THAT
BUT
ARE
STILL
NOWHERE
NEAR
AS
BAD
AS
THEY
USED
TO
BE
SO
YES
THE
SHOTS
DO
WORK
