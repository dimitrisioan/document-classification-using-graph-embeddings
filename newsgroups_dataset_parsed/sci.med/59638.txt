RE
CURE
FOR
DRY
SKIN
FROM
OREN
HABERSCHAIM
JLECHERPBSORG
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
ALEX
MOU
WRITES
HI
ALL
MY
SKIN
IS
VERY
DRY
IN
GENERAL
BUT
THE
MOST
SERIOUS
PART
IS
LOCATED
FROM
KNEES
DOWN
THE
SKIN
THERE
LOOKS
LIKE
SEGMENTED
THE
SEGMENTATION
ACTUALLY
HAPPENS
BENEATH
THE
SKIN
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
CURE
FOR
THIS
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FACT
I
JUST
SAW
A
DERMATOLOGIST
THE
OTHER
DAY
AND
WHILE
I
WAS
THERE
I
ASKED
HIM
ABOUT
DRY
SKIN
ID
BEEN
SPENDING
A
SMALL
FORTUNE
ON
VARIOUS
CREAMS
LOTIONS
AND
OTHER
DRY
SKIN
TREATMENTS
HE
SAID
ALL
I
NEEDED
WAS
A
LARGE
JAR
OF
VASELINE
SOAK
IN
A
LUKEWARM
TUB
OF
WATER
FOR
MINUTES
ONLY
MINUTES
THEN
MASSAGE
IN
THE
VASELINE
TO
TRAP
THE
MOISTURE
IN
THAT
IS
THE
STANDARD
ADVICE
IN
DERMATOLOGY
TEXTS
THE
SOAK
PART
GREATLY
INCREASES
THE
INCONVENIENCE
DONT
BOTHER
UNLESS
IT
DOESNT
WORK
OTHERWISE
THE
HARD
PART
WILL
BE
FINDING
THE
TIME
TO
RUB
IN
THE
VASELINE
PROPERLY
EXACTLY
BUT
IT
ADDS
TO
THE
RITUAL
ASPECT
WHICH
IS
IMPORTANT
FOR
US
SUGGESTIBLE
PATIENTS
POSTERS
DONT
BOTHER
TO
REPEAT
THE
RATIONALE
FOR
THE
SOAK
IF
ITS
NOT
DONE
RIGHT
YOU
REMAIN
GREASY
AND
STICK
GREASY
NO
MATTER
WHAT
VASELINE
GENERICALLY
PETROLATUM
IS
FAMOUS
FOR
THAT
ONE
TEXT
STATES
THAT
THE
MORE
GREASY
A
DRYSKIN
CREAM
IS
THE
MORE
EFFECTIVE
TRY
IT
ITS
GOT
TO
BE
CHEAPER
THEN
SPENDING
FOR
OZ
OF
NATURAL
LOTION
TRY
USP
LANOLIN
AT
LEAST
FOR
MAINTENANCE
PREVENTIVE
THERAPY
USP
LANOLIN
IS
NATURAL
AND
MUCH
LESS
GREASY
AND
CHEAP
DONT
BUY
THE
MORE
EXPENSIVE
PERFUMED
LANOLIN
MIXTURE
AS
IVE
COMMENTED
BEFORE
PETROLATUM
IS
A
POORLY
CHARACTERIZED
MIXTURE
OF
HYDROCARBONS
WHICH
ARE
NOT
FOUND
IN
BIOLOGICAL
SYSTEMS
THAT
IS
NOT
INHERENTLY
BAD
BUT
SMELL
IT
UP
CLOSE
EVEN
ON
YOUR
HAND
ARE
PARTIALLY
ABSORBED
INTO
THE
BODY
AND
REMAIN
THERE
FOR
MONTHS
OR
MORE
AND
HAVE
ASSOCIATIONS
WITH
CANCER
DONT
PANIC
BUT
ALSO
DONT
BELIEVE
ITS
GODS
GIFT
TO
THE
HUMAN
SKIN
