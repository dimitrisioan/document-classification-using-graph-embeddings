SOMEONE
WROTE
IN

CONCERN
ABOUT
GETTING
AIDS
FROM
ACUPUNCTURE
NEEDLES
UNLESS
YOUR
FRIEND
IS
SHARING
FLUIDS
WITH
THEIR
ACUPUNCTURIST
WHO
THEMSELVES
HAS

UNLIKELY
NOT
IMPOSSIBLE
THEY
WILL

ACUPUNCTURE
NEEDLES
GENERALLY
EVEN
IF

THE

MOST
ACUPUNCTURISTS
USE
DISPOSABLE
NEEDLESUSE
ONCE
AND
THROW
AWAY
THEY
DO
THIS
BECAUSE
YOU
ARE
NOT
THE
ONLY
ONE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
TRANSMISSION
OF
DISEASES
VIA
THIS
ROUTESO
ITS
GOOD
BUSINESS
TO
ADVERTISE
DISPOSABLE
NEEDLESUSED
HERE
THESE
NEEDLES
TEND
TO
BE
OF
A
LOWER
QUALITY
HOWEVER
BEING
POORLY
MANUFACTURED
AND
TOO
SHARP
IN
MY
OPINION
THEY
TEND
TO
SNAG
BLOODVESSELS
ON
INSERTION
COMPARED
TO
HIGHER
QUALITY
NEEDLES
IF
I
CHOOSE
TO
USE
ACUPUNCTURE
FOR
A
GIVEN
COMPLAINT
THAT
PATIENT
WILL
GET
THEIR
OWN
SET
OF
NEW
NEEDLES
WHICH
ARE
STERILIZED
BETWEEN
TREATMENTS
THE
RISK
HERE
FOR
HEPATITIS
HIV
ETC
TRANSMISSION
IS
THAT
I
COULD
MISTAKENLY
USE
AN

CLEAR
LABELLING

PAYING
