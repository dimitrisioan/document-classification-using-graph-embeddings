RE
MY
NEW
DIET
IT
WORKS
GREAT
GORDON
BANKS
A
LOT
TO
KEEP
FROM
GOING
BACK
TO
MORBID
OBESITY
I
THINK
ALL
OF
US
CYCLE
ONES
SUCCESS
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
LARGE
THE
FLUCTUATIONS
IN
THE
CYCLE
ARE
SOME
PEOPLE
CAN
CYCLE
ONLY
POUNDS
UNFORTUNATELY
IM
NOT
ONE
OF
THEM
THIS
CERTAINLY
DESCRIBES
MY
SITUATION
PERFECTLY
FOR
ME
THERE
IS
A
CONSTANT
DYNAMIC
BETWEEN
MY
TENDENCY
TO
EAT
WHICH
APPEARS
TO
BE
TOTALLY
LIMITLESS
AND
THE
PURELY
CONSCIOUS
DESIRE
TO
NOT
PUT
ON
TOO
MUCH
WEIGHT
WHEN
I
GET
TOO
FAT
I
JUST
DIETEXERCISE
MORE
WITH
VARYING
DEGREES
OF
SUCCESS
TO
TAKE
OFF
THE
EXTRA
WEIGHT
USUALLY
I
CYCLE
WITHIN
A
LB
RANGE
BUT
SMALLER
AND
LARGER
CYCLES
OCCUR
AS
WELL
IM
ALWAYS
AFRAID
THAT
THIS
METHOD
WILL
STOP
WORKING
SOMEDAY
BUT
USUALLY
I
SEEM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
HOLD
THE
WEIGHT
GAIN
IN
CHECK
THIS
IS
ONE
REASON
I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
ACCEPTING
THE
NOTION
OF
SOME
METABOLIC
DERANGEMENT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CYCLE
DIETING
THAT
RESULTS
IN
LONGTERM
WEIGHT
GAIN
I
HAVE
BEEN
CYCLE
DIETING
FOR
AT
LEAST
YEARS
WITHOUT
SEEING
SUCH
A
CHANGE
I
THINK
A
VIGOROUS
EXERCISE
PROGRAM
CAN
GO
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARD
KEEPING
THE
CYCLES
SMALLER
AND
THE
BASELINE
WEIGHT
LOW
