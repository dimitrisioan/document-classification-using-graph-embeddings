HERES
A
POTENTIALLY
STUPID
QUESTION
TO
POSSIBLY
THE
WRONG
NEWS
GROUP
BUT

MEN
GET
YEAST
INFECTIONS
SPREAD

WHAT
KIND
OF
SYMPTOMS
SIMILAR
AS

HUSBAND

A
NATURAL
PARANOID
ON
A
GOOD
DAY

SURE
HES
GONNA
CATCH
IT
AND
KEEPS
ASKING

RATHER
NASTY
ONES
FROM

OF
THE
SCROTUM
AND
THE
BASE
OF
THE

THEYRE
NOWHERE
NEAR
AS
DANGEROUS
FOR
ME
AS
FOR
MANY
WOMEN

GODDAMN
DOES
IT
HURT
IN
THE
SUMMERTIME
EVEN
IN
THE
WINTERTIME
WHEN
I
SWEAT
I
GET
REALLY
UNCOMFY
DOWN
THERE
THE
BEST
THING
I
CAN
DO
TO
KEEP
IT
UNDER
CONTROL
IS
KEEP
MY
WEIGHT
DOWN
AND
KEEP
COOL
DOWN
THERE
SHORTS
IN
DEGREE

THAT
KIND
OF
THING
AND
OF
COURSE
SOME
OCCASIONAL
