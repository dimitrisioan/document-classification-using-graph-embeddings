SENSITIVITY
SUPERSTITION
HAVE
YOU
EVER
MET
A
CHEMIST
A
FOOD
INDUSTRY
BUSINESSMAN
YOU
MUST
PERSONALLY
KNOW
A
LOT
OF
THEM
FOR
YOU
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BE
SO
CERTAIN
THAT
THEY
ARE
EVIL
MOSTERS
WHOSE
ONLY
GOAL
IS
TO
INFLICT
AS
MUCH
PAIN
AND
DISEASE
AS
POSSIBLE
INTO
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
GIMME
A
BREAK
IN
ARTICLE
LUNDBYRTSGMOTCOM
WALTER
F
L
UNDBY
WRITES
IS
THERE
SUCH
A
THING
AS
MSG
MONOSODIUM
GLUTAMATE
SENSITIVITY
SUPERSTITION
ANYBODY
HERE
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
PERSON
WHO
IS
VERY
SENSITIVE
TO
MSG
AND
WHOSE
WIFE
AND
KIDS
ARE
TOO
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHY
THE
FOOD
INDUSTRY
WANTS
TO
PUT
MSG
IN
FOOD
BECAUSE
IT
MAKES
THE
FOOD
TASTE
BETTER
WHY
DOES
IT
PUT
SALT
IN
FOOD
SAME
REASON
I
REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
OBVIOUSLY
SOMEBODY
IN
THE
INDUSTRY
GIVE
ME
SOME
REASONS
WHY
IS
IT
AN
INDUSTRIAL
BYPRODUCT
THAT
NEEDS
GETTING
GET
RID
OF
OF
COURSE
NOT
ALTHOUGH
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
A
PERSON
LIKE
YOU
WOULD
BE
A
BIG
FAN
OF
SUCH
RECYCLING
IF
THAT
WERE
THE
CASE
IS
IT
TO
COVER
UP
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
RECIPES
ARE
NOT
VERY
GOOD
OR
THE
FOOD
IS
POOR
QUALITY
ON
OCCASION
THATS
PROBABLY
THE
CASE
BUT
IN
GENERAL
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
MSG
IMPROVES
THE
FLAVOR
OF
CERTAIN
FOODS
DO
SOME
OF
YOU
GET
A
SADISTIC
PLEASURE
OUT
OF
MAKING
SOME
OF
US
SICK
NO
DO
THE
TASTE
TESTERS
HAVE
SOME
DEFECT
IN
THEIR
FLAVOR
SENSORS
MOUTH
ETC
THAT
MSG
CORRECTS
NO
I
REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
OBVIOUSLY
ALSO
NITROSIAMINES
SP
AS
I
RECALL
THESE
ARE
NATURAL
BYPRODUCTS
OF
HEATING
UP
CERTAIN
FOODS
THEY
DONT
PUT
IT
IN
THERE
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
CRITERIA
IN
CHOOSING
HOW
TO
PROCESS
FOOD
THEY
WANT
TO
MAKE
IT
TASTE
GOOD
LOOK
GOOD
SELL
FOR
A
GOOD
PRICE
ETC
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
USE
IT
TELLS
ME
THAT
THEY
THINK
THAT
IT
CONTRIBUTES
TO
THOSE
GOALS
THEY
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
ONE
OF
THOSE
GOALS
IS
NOT
MAKING
PEOPLE
SICK
SUCH
A
GOAL
WOUD
QUICKLY
DRIVE
THEM
OUT
OF
BUSINESS
AND
FOR
NO
BENEFIT
I
THINK
OUTLAW
THE
USE
OF
THESE
SUBSTANCES
WITHOUT
WARNING
LABELS
AS
LARGE
AS
THOSE
ON
CIG
PACKAGES
WARNING
OF
WHAT
IN
CALIFORNIA
THERE
IS
A
LAW
REQUIRING
THAT
ANYTHING
WHICH
CONTAINS
A
CARCINOGEN
BE
LABELED
THAT
INCLUDES
EVERY
GASLINE
PUMP
MOST
FOODS
AND
EVEN
MONEY
CLEANING
MACHINES
BECAUSE
NICKEL
IS
A
MILD
CARCINOGEN
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
NOW
NOBODY
PAYS
ANY
ATTENTION
TO
ANY
OF
THE
WARNINGS
REQUIRE
OF
COMPARABLE
PRODUCTS
ON
THE
MARKET
TO
BE
FREE
OF
THESE
SUBSTANCES
AND
STATE
THAT
THEY
ARE
FREE
OF
MSG
DYES
NITROSIAMINES
AND
SULFITES
ON
THE
PACKAGE
WHY
WHAT
IF
NOT
OF
PEOPLE
WANTED
TO
BUY
THIS
UGLY
ROTTEN
NOTASTASTY
FOOD
I
GUESS
IT
WILL
JUST
BE
WASTED
HUH
HOW
TERRIBLY
EFFICIENT
WHILE
AT
IT
OUTLAW
YELLOW
DYE
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WHY
DYE
FOOD
BECAUSE
IT
MAKES
FOOD
LOOK
BETTER
I
LIKE
FOOD
THAT
LOOKS
GOOD
IF
VITAMIN
COMPANIES
WANT
TO
DO
THAT
IT
IS
FINE
BUT
WHO
ARE
YOU
TO
TELL
THEM
HOW
TO
MAKE
VITAMINS
WHO
ARE
YOU
TO
TELL
ME
WHETHER
I
SHOULD
BUY
FLAVORED
VITAMINS
FOR
MY
KIDS
WHO
CANT
SWALLOW
THE
CONVENTIONAL
ONES
WHOLE
KEEP
FOOD
FOOD
QUIT
PUTTING
IN
JUNK
HOW
DO
YOU
DEFINE
JUNK
IS
PUTTING
SALT
IN
FOOD
BAD
WHAT
ABOUT
PEPPER
WHAT
ABOUT
ALCOHOL
AS
A
PRESERVATIVE
WHAT
ABOUT
SEALING
JARS
WITH
WAX
WHAT
ABOUT
VINEGAR
YOU
SEEM
TO
THINK
THAT
CHEMICALS
ARE
SOMEHOW
DIFFERENT
THAN
FOOD
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
ALL
FOODS
ARE
CHEMICALS
YOU
ARE
JUST
EXPRESSING
AN
IRRATIONAL
PREJUDICE
AGAINST
FOOD
PROCESSING
BRIAN
