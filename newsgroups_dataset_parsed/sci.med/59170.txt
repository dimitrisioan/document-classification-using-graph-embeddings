HAD

NERVE
TESTING
DONE
A
WHILE
BACK
THE
NEEDLES
WERE
TAKEN
FROM
A
DIRTY
DRAWER
IN
AN
INSTRUMENT
CART
AND
WERE
MOST
CERTAINLY
NOT
STERILE
OR

LIKELY

WERE
FRESH
FROM
THE
PREVIOUS
PATIENT
I
WAS
CONCERNED

KEPT
MY
MOUTH
SHUT

DESCRIBE

NEVER
HEARD
ABOUT

OF
LIGHT
ONLY
THROUGH
THAT
PART
OF
THE
SYSTEM
WHERE
IT
LEAVES
NO
