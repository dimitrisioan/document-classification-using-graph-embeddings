RUTH
GINZBERG
WRITES
HMMMM
HERES
ONE
PLACE
WHERE
I
REALLY
THINK
THE
PATIENT
OUGHT
TO
TAKE
MORE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
HIM
OR
HERSELF
THERE
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
REASON
WHY
YOU
CANT
ASK
THE
PHARMACIST
FILLING
THE
PRESCRIPTION
FOR
THE
PHYSICIANS
PACKAGE
INSERT
FOR
THE
MEDICATION
WHEN
YOU
PICK
IT
UP
AT
THE
PHARMACY
MAKE
SURE
TO
TELL
THE
PHARMACIST
THAT
YOU
WANT
THE
PHYSICIANS
PACKAGE
INSERT
NOT
THE
IF
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
DO
THIS
I
REALLY
WISH
THEY
WOULD
TELL
ME
FIRST
ID
BE
HAPPY
TO
GO
OVER
THE
INSERT
IN
THE
PDR
WITH
THEM
AND
EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING
ALL
TOO
MANY
PATIENTS
READ
THE
INSERT
AND
PANIC
AND
THEN
ON
THE
NEXT
VISIT
SHEEPISHLY
ADMIT
THEY
WERE
AFRAID
TO
TAKE
THE
DRUG
AND
WE
ARE
STARTING
OVER
AGAIN
AT
SQUARE
ONE
SOME
OF
THEM
PROBABLY
DIDNT
EVEN
COME
BACK
FOR
FOLLOWUP
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDNT
WANT
TO
ADMIT
THEY
WOULDNT
TAKE
THE
DRUG
OR
THOUGHT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
KILL
THEM
OR
SOMETHING
WHAT
PEOPLE
DONT
UNDERSTAND
ABOUT
THE
INSERTS
IS
THAT
THEY
REPORT
EVERY
ADVERSE
SIDE
EFFECT
EVER
REPORTED
WITHOUT
SUBSTANTIATING
THAT
THE
DRUG
WAS
RESPONSIBLE
THE
INSERT
IS
A
LEGAL
DOCUMENT
TO
SLOUGH
LIABILITY
FROM
THE
MANUFACTURER
TO
THE
PHYSICIAN
IF
SOMETHING
WAS
TO
HAPPEN
IF
PATIENTS
WANT
TO
HAVE
THE
MOST
USEFUL
AND
RELIABLE
INFORMATION
ON
A
DRUG
THEY
WOULD
BE
SO
MUCH
BETTER
OFF
GETTING
HOLD
OF
ONE
OF
THE
AMA
DRUG
EVALUATION
BOOKS
OR
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
THAT
IS
MUCH
MORE
SCIENTIFIC
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
DRUGS
THAT
SOMEONE
HASNT
REPORTED
A
DEATH
FROM
TAKING
PATIENTS
DONT
REALIZE
THAT
AND
DONT
USUALLY
APPRECIATE
THE
RISKS
TO
THEMSELVES
PROPERLY
IM
SURE
HERMAN
IS
GOING
TO
GO
BALLISTIC
BUT
SO
BE
IT
ANOTHER
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
PROBABLY
MOST
DRUGS
HAVE
BEEN
REPORTED
TO
CAUSE
IMPOTENCE
HALF
THE
MALES
WHO
READ
THAT
WILL
FALSELY
ASSUME
IT
COULD
PERMANENTLY
CAUSE
THEM
TO
LOSE
SEXUAL
FUNCTION
AND
SO
WILL
REFUSE
TO
TAKE
ANY
DRUG
LIKE
THAT
THIS
CAN
BE
A
REAL
PROBLEM
FOR
PDR
READERS
THERE
NEEDS
TO
BE
SOME
WAY
OF
PROVIDING
PATIENTS
WITH
TOOLS
GEARED
TO
THEM
THAT
ALLOW
THEM
TO
GET
THE
INFORMATION
THEY
NEED
I
AM
INVOLVED
IN
A
RESEARCH
PROJECT
TO
DO
THAT
WITH
MIGRAINE
AS
THE
DOMAIN
IT
INVOLVES
A
COMPUTER
SYSTEM
THAT
WILL
PROVIDE
ANSWERS
TO
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
MIGRAINE
AS
WELL
AS
THE
THERAPY
PRESCRIBED
FOR
THE
PATIENT
FOR
COMMON
ILLNESSES
SUCH
AS
MIGRAINE
AND
HYPERTENSION
THIS
MAY
HELP
QUITE
A
BIT
THE
PATIENT
COULD
SPEND
AS
MUCH
TIME
AS
NEEDED
WITH
THE
COMPUTER
AND
THIS
WOULD
THEN
NOT
BURDEN
THE
PHYSICIAN
CLEARLY
PHYSICIANS
IN
LARGE
PART
FAIL
TO
ANSWER
ALL
THE
QUESTIONS
PATIENTS
HAVE
AS
IS
DEMONSTRATED
OVER
AND
OVER
HERE
ON
THE
NET
WHERE
WE
GET
ASKED
THINGS
THAT
THE
PATIENTS
SHOULD
HAVE
FOUND
OUT
FROM
THEIR
PHYSICIAN
BUT
DIDNT
WHY
THEY
DIDNT
ISNT
ALWAYS
THE
PHYSICIANS
FAULT
EITHER
SOMETIMES
THE
PATIENTS
ARE
AFRAID
TO
ASK
THEY
WONT
BE
AS
AFRAID
TO
ASK
THE
SYSTEM
WE
HOPE
GORDON
BANKS
SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND
GEBCADREDSLPITTEDU
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
