HERE
IS
ANOTHER
ANECDOTAL
STORY
I
AM
A
PICKY
EATER
AND
NEVER
WANTED
TO
TRY
CHINESE
FOOD
HOWEVER
I
FINALLY
TRIED
SOME
IN
ORDER
TO
PLEASE
A
GIRL
I
WAS
SEEING
AT
THE
TIME
I
HAD
NEVER
HEARD
OF
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
SYNDROME
A
GROUP
OF
US
WENT
TO
THE
RESTAURANT
AND
ALL
SHARED
DIFFERENT
DISHES
IT
DIDNT
TASTE
GREAT
BUT
I
DECIDED
IT
WASNT
SO
BAD
WE
WENT
HOME
AND
WENT
TO
BED
EARLY
I
WOKE
UP
AT
AM
AND
PUKED
MY
GUTS
OUTS
I
THREW
UP
FOR
SO
LONG
THAT
IM
NOT
KIDDING
I
PULLED
A
MUSCLE
IN
MY
TONGUE
DRY
HEAVES
AND
EVERYTHING
NO
ONE
ELSE
GOT
SICK
AND
IM
NOT
ALLERGIC
TO
ANYTHING
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
SUFFICE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
WONT
GO
INTO
A
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
UNLESS
I
AM
PHYSICALLY
THREATENED
THE
SMELL
OF
THE
FOOD
MAKES
ME
ILL
AND
THAT
IS
A
PSYCHOLGICAL
REACTION
WHEN
I
HAVE
BEEN
DRAGGED
IN
TO
SUFFER
THROUGH
BEEF
AND
BROCCOLI
WITHOUT
ANY
SAUCES
I
INSIST
ON
NO
MSG
I
HAVENT
GOTTEN
SICK
YET
FUNNY
ABOUT
THAT
MY
WIFE
MY
GIRLFRIEND
AT
THE
TIME
USED
TO
GET
SICK
AFTER
EATING
CERTAIN
FOODS
AT
VARIOUS
ASIAN
RESTAURANTS
AND
NEVER
KNEW
WHY
SHED
GO
PALE
AND
SWEATY
AND
THEN
VOMIT
COPIOUSLY
A
COUPLE
OF
US
VENTURED
A
CONNECTION
WITH
MSG
AND
HER
RESPONSE
WAS
MSG
WHATS
THAT
IT
ALSO
HAPPENED
WHEN
SHE
PIGGED
OUT
ON
SOME
BRANDS
OF
SAVOURY
CRACKERS
AND
CHIPS

NOTICED
LATER

THE
LABEL

AVOIDING
MSG
HAS
STOPPED
HER
BEING
SICK

RESTAURANTS
