RE
SCIENCE
AND
METHODOLOGY
WAS
HOMEOPATHY
TRADITION
IN
ARTICLE
TURPINCSUTEXASEDU
RUSSELL
TURPIN
WRITES
NOT
IMPLY
THAT
ALL
THEIR
TREATMENTS
ARE
INEFFECTIVE
IT
DOES
IMPLY
THAT
THOSE
WHO
RELY
ON
FAULTY
METHODOLOGY
AND
REASONING
ARE
INCAPABLE
OF
DISCOVERING
WHICH
TREATMENTS
ARE
EFFECTIVE
AND
WHICH
ARE
NOT
TO
START
WITH
NO
METHODOLOGY
OR
FORM
OF
REASONING
IS
INFALLIBLE
SO
THERES
A
QUESTION
OF
HOW
MUCH
CERTAINTY
WE
ARE
WILLING
TO
PAY
FOR
IN
A
GIVEN
CONTEXT
INSISTENCE
ON
TOO
MUCH
RIGOR
BOGS
SCIENCE
DOWN
COMPLETELY
AND
MAKES
PROGRESS
IMPOSSIBLE
EXPENDITURE
OF
SUFFICIENTLY
LARGE
SUMS
OF
MONEY
AND
AMOUNTS
OF
TIME
CAN
SOMETIMES
OVERCOME
THIS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WITH
TOO
LITTLE
RIGOR
MUCH
IS
LOST
BY
BASING
WORK
ON
RESULTS
WHICH
EVENTUALLY
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
FALSE
THERE
IS
A
MORASS
OF
STUDIES
CONTRADICTING
OTHER
STUDIES
AND
OUTSIDERS
START
SAYING
YOU
PEOPLE
CALL
THIS
SCIENCE
MY
OPINION
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
IS
THAT
ONE
SEES
BOTH
THESE
PHENOMENA
HAPPENING
SIMULTANEOUSLY
IN
SOME
PARTS
OF
PSYCHOLOGY
SOME
SUBJECTIVE
JUDGEMENT
IS
REQUIRED
TO
DECIDE
ON
THE
LEVEL
OF
RIGOR
APPROPRIATE
FOR
A
PARTICULAR
INVESTIGATION
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IT
IS
EVER
POSSIBLE
TO
BANISH
SUBJECTIVE
JUDGEMENT
FROM
SCIENCE
MY
SECOND
POINT
THOUGH
IS
THAT
HIGHLY
CAPABLE
PEOPLE
CAN
OFTEN
MAKE
EXTREMELY
RELIABLE
JUDGEMENTS
ABOUT
SCIENTIFIC
VALIDITY
EVEN
WHEN
USING
METHODOLOGY
CONSIDERED
INADEQUATE
BY
THE
USUAL
STANDARDS
I
THINK
THIS
IS
TRUE
OF
MANY
SCIENTISTS
AND
I
THINK
IT
IS
TRUE
OF
MANY
WHO
APPROACH
THEIR
DISCIPLINE
IN
A
WAY
THAT
IS
NOT
GENERALLY
RECOGNIZED
AS
SCIENTIFIC
WITHIN
MATHEMATICS
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
EXAMPLES
ESPECIALLY
BEFORE
THE
TWENTIETH
CENTURY
ONE
CONSPICUOUS
CASE
IS
THAT
OF
RIEMANN
WHO
IS
FAMOUS
FOR
MANY
THEOREMS
HE
STATED
BUT
DID
NOT
PROVE
LATER
MATHEMATICIANS
DID
PROVE
THEM
OF
COURSE
I
THINK
THAT
FOR
A
GOOD
SCIENTIST
EMPIRICAL
INVESTIGATION
IS
OFTEN
NOT
SO
MUCH
A
MATTER
OF
DETERMINING
WHAT
IS
TRUE
AND
WHATS
NOT
AS
IT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
CONVINCING
OTHER
PEOPLE
PEOPLE
HAVE
PROPOSED
LOTS
OF
INCOMPATIBLE
DEFINITIONS
OF
SCIENCE
HERE
BUT
I
THINK
THE
ABILITY
TO
OBJECTIVELY
CONVINCE
OTHERS
OF
THE
VALIDITY
OF
ONES
RESULTS
IS
AN
ESSENTIAL
ELEMENT
NOT
THAT
ONE
CAN
NECESSARILY
DO
THAT
AT
EVERY
STEP
OF
THE
SCIENTIFIC
PROCESS
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
IF
ONE
IS
NOT
MOVING
TOWARD
THAT
GOAL
THEN
ONE
IS
NOT
DOING
SCIENCE
WHEN
A
PERSON
OTHER
THAN
A
SCIENTIST
IS
QUITE
GOOD
AT
WHAT
HE
DOES
AND
SEEMS
TO
BE
VERY
SUCCESSFUL
AT
IT
I
THINK
THAT
HIS
JUDGEMENTS
ARE
ALSO
WORTHY
OF
RESPECT
AND
THAT
HIS
ASSERTIONS
ARE
WELL
WORTH
FURTHER
INVESTIGATION
IN
ARTICLE
I
WROTE
NAMELY
IS
THERE
REALLY
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
THE
BELIEF
THAT
SCIENCE
IS
A
SUPERIOR
PATH
TO
TRUTH
THAN
NONSCIENTIFIC
APPROACHES
ADMITTEDLY
MY
QUESTION
WAS
NOT
AT
ALL
WELL
POSED
A
CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
EFFORT
IN
A
SERIOUS
SCHOLARLY
INVESTIGATION
SUCH
AS
I
SUGGESTED
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
SIMPLY
TO
FORMULATE
AN
APPROPRIATELY
SPECIFIC
QUESTION
TO
TRY
AND
ANSWER
THE
SCIENCE
I
WAS
THINKING
OF
IN
MY
QUESTION
IS
THE
ACTUAL
SCIENCE
CURRENTLY
PRACTICED
NOW
IN
THE
LAST
DECADE
OF
THE
TWENTIETH
CENTURY
I
CERTAINLY
WASNT
THINKING
OF
SOME
IDEALIZED
SCIENCE
OR
THE
MERE
USE
OF
REASON
AND
OBSERVATION
ONE
THING
I
HAD
IN
MIND
IN
MY
SUGGESTION
WAS
THE
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHETHER
IN
MANY
CASES
THE
SUBJECTIVE
JUDGEMENTS
OF
SKILLED
AND
EXPERIENCED
PRACTITIONERS
MIGHT
BE
MORE
RELIABLE
THAN
STATISTICAL
STUDIES
SINCE
RUSSELL
TURPIN
SEEMS
TO
BE
MUCH
MORE
FAMILIAR
THAN
I
AM
WITH
THE
STUDY
OF
SCIENTIFIC
METHODOLOGY
PERHAPS
HE
CAN
TELL
US
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
EXISTING
RESEARCH
RELATED
TO
THIS
QUESTION
IN
THE
ARGUMENTS
BETWEEN
BEHAVIORISTS
AND
COGNITIVISTS
PSYCHOLOGY
SEEMS
LESS
LIKE
A
SCIENCE
THAN
A
COLLECTION
OF
COMPETING
RELIGIOUS
SECTS
