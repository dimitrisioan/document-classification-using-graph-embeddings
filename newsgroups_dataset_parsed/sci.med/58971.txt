ive
been
invited
to
spend
a
couple
weeks
this
summer
rafting
down
the
mississippi
my
journey
partners
want
to
live
off
of
river
water
and
catfish
along
the
route
should
i
have
any
concerns
about
pollution
or
health
risks
in
doing
this
youd
have
to
purify
the
river
water
first
im
not
sure
how
practical
that
is
with
the
mississippi
youd
better
check
with
health
agencies
along
the
way
to
see
if
there
are
toxic
chemicals
in
the
river
if
it
is
just
microorganisms
those
can
be
filtered
or
killed
but
you
may
need
activated
charcoal
or
other
means
to
purify
from
chemicals
better
be
same
than
sorry
obviously
drinking
the
river
without
processing
it
is
likely
to
make
you
sick
from
bacteria
and
parasites
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and

it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
