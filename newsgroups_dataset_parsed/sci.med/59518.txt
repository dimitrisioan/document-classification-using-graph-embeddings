SAYS
LEAST
A
FEW
ENLIGHTENED
PHYSICIANS
PRACTICING
IN
THE
US
ITS
REALLY
TOO
BAD
THAT
MOST
US
MEDICAL
SCHOOLS
DONT
COVER
NUTRITION
BECAUSE
IF
THEY
DID
CANDIDA
WOULD
NOT
BE
VIEWED
AS
A
NONDISEASE
BY
SO
MANY
IN
THE
MEDICAL
PROFESSION
CASE
WESTERN
RESERVE
MED
SCHOOL
TEACHES
NUTRITION
IN
ITS
OWN
SECTION
AS
WELL
AS
COVERING
IT
IN
OTHER
SECTIONS
AS
THEY
APPLY
IE
DEFICIENCY
IN
NEURO
AS
A
CAUSE
OF
NEUROPATHY
DEFICIENCY
IN
HEMATOLOGY
AS
A
CAUSE
OF
MEGALOBLASTIC
ANEMIA
YET
I
SILL
HOLD
THE
VIEWPOINT
OF
MAINSTREAM
MEDICINE
CANDIDA
CAN
CAUSE
MUCOCUTANEOUS
CANDIDIASIS
AND
IN
ALREADY
VERY
SICK
PATIENTS
WITH
DAMAGED
IMMUNE
SYSTEMS
LIKE
AIDS
AND
CANCER
PATIENTS
SYSTEMIC
CANDIDA
INFECTION
I
THINK
THE
YEAST
CONNECTION
IS
A
BUNCH
OF
HOOEY
WHAT
DOES
THIS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
HOW
WELL
NUTRITION
IS
TAUGHT
ANYWAY
ELISABETH
LETS
SET
THE
RECORD
STRAIGHT
FOR
THE
NTH
TIME
I
HAVE
NOT
READ
THE
YEAST
CONNECTION
SO
ANYTHING
THAT
I
SAY
IS
NOT
DUE
TO
BRAINWASHING
BY
THIS
HATED
BOOK
ITS
OKAY
I
GUESS
TO
HATE
THE
BOOK
BY
WHY
HATE
ME
ELISABETH
IM
GOING
TO
QUOTE
FROM
ZINSSERS
MICROBIOLOGY
EDITION
A
BOOK
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
FAMILIAR
WITH
AND
NOT
HATE
CANDIDA
SPECIES
COLONIZE
THE
MUCOSAL
SURFACES
OF
ALL
HUMANS
DURING
BIRTH
OR
SHORTLY
THEREAFTER
THE
RISK
OF
ENDOGENOUS
INFECTION
IS
CLEARLY
EVER
PRESENT
INDEED
CANDIDIASIS
OCCURS
WORLDWIDE
AND
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
SYSTEMIC
MYCOSIS
NEUTROPHILS
PLAY
THE
MAIN
ROLE
IN
PREVENTING
A
SYSTEMIC
INFECTIONCANDIDIASIS
SO
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
HAVE
A
LOW
NEUTROPHIL
COUNT
OR
SICK
NEUTROPHILS
TO
SEE
A
SYSTEMIC
INFECTION
POOR
DIET
AND
PERSISTENT
PARASITIC
INFESTATION
SET
MANY
THIRD
WORLD
RESIDENTS
UP
FOR
CANDIDIASIS
YOUR
ASSESSMENT
OF
CANDIDIASIS
IN
THE
US
IS
CORRECT
AND
I
DO
NOT
DISPUTE
IT
WHAT
I
POSTED
WAS
A
DISCUSSION
OF
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
WITHOUT
SYSTEMIC
INFECTION
THESE
BLOOMS
WOULD
BE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
LOCAL
SITES
OF
IRRITATION
GI
TRACT
MOUTH
VAGINA
AND
SINUS
CAVITY
KNOCKING
DOWN
THE
BACTERIAL
COMPETITION
FOR
CANDIDA
WAS
PROPOSED
AS
A
POSSIBLE
TRIGGER
FOR
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
LET
ME
QUOTE
FROM
ZINSSERS
AGAIN
HOWEVER
SOME
FACTORS
SUCH
AS
THE
USE
OF
A
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBACTERIAL
ANTIBIOTIC
MAY
PREDISPOSE
TO
BOTH
MUCOSAL
AND
SYSTEMIC
INFECTIONS
I
WAS
ADDRESSING
MUCOSAL
INFECTIONS
I
LIKE
THE
TERM
BLOOMS
BETTER
THE
NUTRITION
COURSE
THAT
I
TEACH
COVERS
THIS
EFFECT
OF
ANTIBIOTIC
TREATMENT
AS
WELL
AS
THE
CURE
I
GUESS
THAT
YOUR
NUTRITION
COURSE
DOES
NOT
TOO
BAD
HERE
IS
A
BRIEF
PRIMER
ON
YEAST
YEAST
INFECTIONS
AS
THEY
ARE
COMMONLY
CALLED
ARE
NOT
TRUELY
CAUSED
BY
YEASTS
THE
MOST
COMMON
ORGANISM
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THIS
TYPE
OF
INFECTION
IS
CANDIDA
ALBICANS
OR
MONILIA
WHICH
IS
ACTUALLY
A
YEASTLIKE
FUNGUS
WELL
MAYBE
IM
GETTING
PICKY
BUT
I
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
A
YEAST
WAS
ONE
FORM
THAT
A
FUNGUS
COULD
EXIST
IN
THE
OTHER
BEING
THE
MOLD
FORM
MANY
FUNGI
CAN
OCCUR
AS
EITHER
YEASTS
OR
MOLDS
DEPENDING
ON
ENVIRONMENT
CANDIDA
EXIBITS
WHAT
IS
KNOWN
AS
REVERSE
DIMORPHISM
IT
EXISTS
AS
A
MOLD
IN
THE
TISSUES
BUT
EXISTS
AS
A
YEAST
IN
THE
ENVIRONMENT
SHOULD
WE
MAYBE
CALL
IT
A
MOLD
INFECTION
A
FUNGUS
INFECTION
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
SAY
IT
IS
CAUSED
BY
A
MOLDLIKE
FUNGUS

WEST

OK
YOURE
THE
CHAIRMAN
OF
BIOCHEM
AND
MICRO
AND
YOU
DIDNT
KNOW
THAT
A
YEAST
IS
A
FORM
OF
A
FUNGUS
SHUDDER
OR
MAYBE
YOU
DID
KNOW
AND
WERE
OVERSIMPLIFYING
MY
MY
ELISABETH
DO
I
DETECT
A
LITTLE
OF
STEVE
DYER
IN
YOU
IF
YOU
NOTICED
MY
FACULTY
RANK
IM
A
BIOCHEMIST
NOT
A
MICROBIOLOGIST
CANDIDA
IS
CLASSIFED
AS
A
FUNGUSACCORDING
TO
ZINSSERS
BUT
AS
YOU
POINT
OUT
IT
DISPLAYS
DIMORPHISM
IT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
PRODUCING
YEAST
CELLS
PSEUDOHYPHAE
AND
TRUE
HYPHAE
ELISABETH
YOU
ARE
PROBABLY
A
MICROBIOLOGIST
AND
THAT
MAKES
A
LOT
OF
SENSE
TO
YOU
TO
A
BIOCHEMIST
ITS
A
LOT
OF
GREEK
SO
I
CALLED
IT
A
YEASTLIKE
FUNGUS
GO
AHEAD
AND
CRUCIFY
ME
YOU
KNOW
ELISABETH
I
STILL
HAVENT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
SUCH
A
SMALL
LITTLE
ORGANISM
LIKE
CANDIDA
CAN
BRING
OUT
SO
MUCH
HOSTILITY
IN
PEOPLE
IN
SCI
MED
AND
I
MUST
ADMITT
THAT
I
GOT
SUCKED
INTO
THE
MUD
SLINGING
TOO
I
KEEP
HOPING
THAT
IF
PEOPLE
WILL
JUST
TAKE
THE
TIME
TO
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
IVE
SAID
THAT
IT
WILL
MAKE
SENSE
IM
NOT
ASKING
ANYONE
HERE
TO
BUY
INTO
THE
YEAST
CONNECTION
BOOK
BECAUSE
I
DONT
KNOW
WHATS
IN
THAT
BOOK
PLAIN
AND
SIMPLE
AND
TO
BE
HONEST
WITH
YOU
IM
BEGINNING
TO
WISH
THAT
IT
WAS
NEVER
WRITTEN
