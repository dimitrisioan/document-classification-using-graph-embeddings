WRITES
FROM
A
BUSINESS
POINT
OF
VIEW
IT
MIGHT
MAKE
SENSE
IT
DEPENDS
ON
THE
PERSONALITY
OF
THE
PRACTITIONER
IF
HE
CAN
CHARM
THE
PATIENTS
INTO
COMING
HOMEOPATHY
CAN
BE
VERY
PROFITABLE
IT
WONT
BE
COVERED
BY
INSURANCE
HOWEVER
JUST
KEEP
THAT
IN
MIND
MYSELF
ID
HAVE
IN
MANY
EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES
HOMEPATHY
IS
ACCEPTED
AS
A
METHOD
OF
CURING
OR
AT
LEAST
ALLEIATING
MANY
CONDITIONS
TO
WHICH
MODERN
MEDICINE
HAS
NO
ANSWER
IN
MOST
OF
THESE
COUNTRIES
INSURANCE
PAYS
FOR
THE
TREATMENTS
ACCEPTED
BY
WHOM
NOT
BY
SCIENTISTS
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
IN
EVERY
COUNTRY
WHO
WASTE
TIME
AND
MONEY
ON
QUACKERY
IN
BRITAIN
AND
SCANDANAVIA
WHERE
I
HAVE
WORKED
IT
WAS
NOT
PAID
FOR
WHAT
ARE
MOST
OF
THESE
COUNTRIES
I
DONT
BELIEVE
YOU
IN
HOLLAND
INSURENCES
PAY
FOR
HOMEOPATHIC
TREATMENT
IN
GERMANY
THEY
DO
SO
AS
WELL
I
AUSTRIA
THEY
DO
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
CONDITION
WHICH
CAN
NOT
BE
HELPED
BY
NORMAL
MEDICINE
HAPPENED
TO
ME
SWITZERLAND
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
SAME
AS
AUSTRIA
I
HAVE
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
IN
THE
SWISS
CASE
AT
THE
UNIVERISTY
OF
VIENNA
I
BELIEVE
INNSBRUCK
AS
WELL
HOMEOPATHY
CAN
BE
TAKEN
IN
MED
SCHOOL
I
FOUND
THAT
IN
COMBINATION
WITH
ACUPUNCTURE
IT
CHANGED
MY
LIFE
FROM
LIVING
HELL
TO
A
CONDITION
WHICH
ENABLES
ME
TO
LEAD
A
RELATIVELY
NORMAL
LIFE
I
FOUND
THAT
MODERN
MEDICINE
WAS
POWERLESS
TO
CURE
ME
OF
A
SEVERE
CASE
OF
NEURODERMITIS
NOTE
I
MEAN
CURE
NOT
SURPRESS
THE
SYMPTOMS
WHICH
IS
WHAT
MODERN
MEDICINE
ATTEMPTS
TO
DO
IN
THE
CASE
OF
NEURODERMITIS
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
HOMEOPATHY
IS
SCIENTIFIC
BUT
THAT
IT
CAN
OFFER
HELP
IN
AREAS
IN
WHICH
MODERN
MEDICINE
IS
ABSOLUTELY
HELPLESS
FROM
READING
YOUR
ARITCLE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
YOUR
HAVE
SOME
DEEPLY
ROOTED
BELIEFS
ABOUT
THIS
ISSUE
THIS
IS
NOT
INTENDED
TO
BE
OFFENSIVE
OR
SARCASTIC
IT
JUST
SOUNDED
LIKE
THAT
TO
ME
WHICH
MAKES
ME
DOUBT
IF
YOU
CAN
READ
THIS
WITH
AN
OPEN
MIND
IF
YOU
DOCAN
PLEASE
EXCUSE
MY
LAST
COMMENT
