bates
method
for
myopia
does
the
bates
method
work
i
first
heard
about
it
in
this
newsgroup
several
years
ago
and
i
have
just
got
hold
of
a
book
how
to
improve
your
sight
simple
daily
drills
in
relaxation
by
margaret
d
corbett
authorized
instructor
of
the
bates
method
published
in
it
talks
about
vision
improvement
by
relaxation
and
exercise
has
there
been
any
study
on
whether
this
method
actually
works
if
it
works
is
it
by
actually
shortening
the
previously
elongated
eyeball
or
by
increasing
the
lenss
ability
to
flatten
itself
in
order
to
compensate
for
the
toolong
eyeball
since
myopia
is
the
result
of
eyeball
elongation
seems
to
me
the
most
logical
approach
for
correction
is
to
find
a
way
to
reverse
the
process
ie
shorten
it
somehow
preferably
nonsurgically
has
there
been
any
recent
studies
on
this
where
can
i
find
them
i
know
rk
works
by
changing
the
curvature
of
the
cornea
to
compensate
for
the
shape
of
eyeball
but
if
there
is
a
way
to
train
the
muscles
to
shorten
the
eyeball
back
to
its
correct
length
that
would
be
even
better
batess
idea
right
thanks
for
any
information
