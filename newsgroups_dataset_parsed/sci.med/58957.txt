THE
ANDROMEDA
STRAIN
JUST
HAD
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
WATCH
THIS
FLICK
ON
AE
SOME
YEARS
SINCE
I
SAW
IT
LAST
I
WAS
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
THE
TECHNOLOGY
DEMONSTRATED
IN
THIS
FILM
FOR
HANDLING
INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
AND
SIMILAR
TOXIC
SUBSTANCES
CLEARLY
THEY
FAKED
A
LOT
OF
THE
COMPUTER
ROBOTIC
TECHNOLOGY
CERTAINLY
AT
THE
TIME
IT
WAS
MADE
MOST
OF
THAT
WAS
SCIENCE
FICTION
ITSELF
LET
ALONE
THE
IDEA
OF
A
SPACE
GERM
QUITE
COINCIDENTALLY
ACTUALLY
THIS
IS
WHAT
GOT
ME
WANTED
TO
SEE
THE
MOVIE
AGAIN
I
WATCHED
A
SEGMENT
ON
THE
OTHERWISE
AWFUL
HOWD
THEY
DO
THAT
DEALING
WITH
A
DISEASE
RESEARCHER
AT
THE
CDCS
TOP
LAB
THERE
WAS
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
ELABORATE
SECURITY
MEASURES
TAKEN
SO
THAT
BUILDING
WILL
NEVER
BE
CRACKED
SO
TO
SPEAK
BY
MAN
OR
NATURE
SHORT
OF
DELIBERATE
BOMBING
FROM
THE
AIR
PERHAPS
AND
THE
RESEARCHERS
USED
SPACESUITS
SIMILAR
TO
THAT
IN
THE
FILM
IM
CURIOUS
WHAT
PEOPLE
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
FILM
SHORT
OF
SILLY
IS
SUCH
A
FACILITY
TECHNICALLY
FEASIBLE
TODAY
AS
FAR
AS
THE
PLOT
AND
THE
CRYSTALLINE
STRUCTURE
THAT
IS
NOT
LIFE
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
THATS
A
WHOLE
NOTHER
