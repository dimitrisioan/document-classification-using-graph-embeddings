SEE
THE
ULTERIOR
MOTIVE
HERE
IT
IS
EASY
FOR
ME
TO
SEE
IT
THE
THOSE
PHYSICIANS
WHO
CALL
EVERYTHING
LYME
AND
TREAT
EVERYTHING
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
INVOLVED
YOU
KEEP
BRINGING
THIS
UP
BUT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHATS
IN
IT
FINANCIALLY
FOR
THE
PHYSICIAN
TO
GO
AHEAD
AND
TREAT
UNLESS
THE
PHYSICIAN
HAS
AN
INVESTMENT
IN
OR
IS
INVOLVED
IN
SOME
KICKBACK
SCHEME
WITH
THE
HOME
INFUSION
COMPANY
WHERE
IS
THE
FINANCIAL
GAIN
FOR
THE
DOCTOR
WELL
LET
ME
PUT
IT
THIS
WAY
BASED
ON
MY
OWN
EXPERIENCE
A
GENERAL
PRACTITIONER
WITH
NO
TRAINING
IN
INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
BY
ESTABLISHING
LINKS
TO
THE
LYME
COMMUNITY
TREATING
PATIENTS
WHO
COME
TO
HIM
WONDERING
ABOUT
LYME
OR
HAVING
DECIDED
THEY
HAVE
LYME
AS
IF
THEY
DID
SAYING
THAT
DISEASES
SUCH
AS
MS
ARE
PROBABLY
SPIROCHETAL
IF
NOT
LYME
GIVING
TALKS
AT
MEETINGS
OF
USERS
GROUPS
VALIDATING
THE
FEELINGS
OF
EVEN
DELUSIONAL
PATIENTS
ETC
THIS
GP
CAN
GO
FROM
BEING
A
RUNOFTHEMILL
GP
TO
SOMEONE
WITH
LOTS
OF
PATIENTS
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
AND
GETTING
EXPENSIVE
INFUSIONS
THAT
NEED
MONITORING
IN
HIS
OFFICE
AND
MAKING
LOTS
OF
BREAD
ALSO
GETTING
THE
ADULATION
OF
MANY
WHO
BELIEVE
HIS
IS
THEIR
ONLY
HOPE
IF
NOT
OF
CURE
THEN
OF
CONTROL
AND
SEEING
HIS
NAME
IN
PUBLICATIONS
PUT
OUT
BY
SUPPORT
GROUPS
ETC
THIS
IS
A
DEFINITE
TEMPTATION
