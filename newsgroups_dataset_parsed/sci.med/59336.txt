RE
FROZEN
SHOULDER
AND
LAWN
MOWING
IN
ARTICLE
ALICE
SANDERS
WRITES
IHAVE
HAD
A
FROZEN
SHOULDER
FOR
OVER
A
YEAR
OR
ABOUT
A
YEAR
IT
IS
STILL
PARTIALLY
FROZEN
AND
I
AM
STILL
IN
PHYSICAL
THERAPY
EVERY
WEEK
BUT
THE
PAIN
HAS
SUBSIDED
ALMOST
COMPLETELY
UNTIL
LAST
WEEK
WHEN
I
MOWED
THE
LAWN
FOR
TWENTY
MINUTES
EACH
TWO
DAYS
IN
A
ROW
I
HAVE
A
PUSH
TYPE
POWER
MOWER
THE
PAIN
STARTED
BACK
UP
A
LITTLE
BIT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
QUITE
A
WHILE
AND
I
USED
ICE
AND
MEDICINE
AGAIN
CAN
ANYBODY
EXPLAIN
WHY
THIS
PARTICULAR
ACTIVITY
WHICH
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
STRESS
ME
VERY
MUCH
GENERALLY
SHOULD
CAUSE
THIS
SHOULDER
PROBLEM
YOU
NEED
TO
USE
YOUR
SHOULDER
MUSCLES
TO
PUSH
THE
MOWER
IF
YOU
HAVENT
BEEN
DOING
MUCH
EXERCISE
AS
I
SUPPOSE
YOU
HAVENT
THEN
A
CONSTANT
MINUTE
LONG
EFFORT
CAN
CAUSE
STIFFNESS
AND
CRAMPS
