im
not
saying
that
culturing
is
the
best
way
to
diagnose
its
very
hard
to
culture
bb
in
most
cases
the
point
is
that
dr
n
has
developed
a
feel
for
what
is
and
what
isnt
ld
this
comes
from
years
of
experience
no
serology
can
match
that
unfortunately
some
would
call
dr
n
a
quack
and
accuse
him
of
trying
to
make
a
quick
buck
why
do
you
think
he
would
be
called
a
quack
the
quacks
dont
do
cultures
they
poopoo
doing
more
lab
tests
this
is
lyme
believe
me
ive
seen
it
many
times
the
lab
tests
arent
accurate
well
treat
it
now
also
is
dr
ns
practice
almost
exclusively
devoted
to
treating
lyme
patients
i
dont
know
any
orthopedic
surgeons
who
fit
this
pattern
they
are
usually
gps
are
you
arguing
that
the
lyme
lab
test
is
accurate
the
books
that
ive
read
say
that
in
general
the
tests
have
a
chance
of
being
correct
the
tests
result
in
a
large
number
of
both
false
positives
and
false
negatives
i
am
in
the
latter
case
we
could
get
those
same
odds
by
rolling
the
dice
