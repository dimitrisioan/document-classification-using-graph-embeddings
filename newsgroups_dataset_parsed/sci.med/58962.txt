WRITES
IS
THERE
SUCH
A
THING
AS
MSG
MONOSODIUM
GLUTAMATE
SENSITIVITY
I
SAW
IN
THE
NY
TIMES
SUNDAY
THAT
SCIENTISTS
HAVE
TESTIFIED
BEFORE
AN
FDA
ADVISORY
PANEL
THAT
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
MSG
SENSITIVITY
ARE
SUPERSTITION
ANYBODY
HERE
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
I
KNOW
THAT
THERE
IS
MSG
SENSITIVITY
WHEN
I
EAT
FOODS
WITH
MSG
I
GET
VERY
THIRSTY
AND
MY
HANDS
SWELL
AND
GET
A
TERRIBLE
ITCHY
RASH
I
FIRST
EXPERIENCED
THIS
PROBLEM
WHEN
I
WORKED
CLOSE
TO
CHINATOWN
AND
ATE
CHINESE
FOOD
ALMOST
EVERYDAY
FOR
LUNCH
NOW
I
CANT
TOLERATE
MSG
AT
ALL
I
CAN
NOTICE
IMMEDIATELY
WHEN
I
HAVE
EATEN
ANY
I
TRY
TO
AVOID
MSG
COMPLETELY
INTERESTING
FACT
THOUGH
IS
THAT
ALL
THREE
OF
MY
CHILDREN
STARTED
EXPERIENCING
THE
EXACT
SAME
RASH
ON
THEIR
HANDS
I
COULDNT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
BECAUSE
I
DONT
MSG
IN
COOKING
AND
WE
ASK
FOR
NO
MSG
WHEN
WE
DO
EAT
CHINESE
I
STILL
LOVE
IT
AFTER
SOME
INVESTIGATION
I
KNEW
THAT
OODLES
OF
NOODLES
WHERE
ONE
OF
THEIR
FAVORITE
FOODS
ONE
OF
THE
MAIN
INGREDIENTS
IN
THE
FLAVOR
PACKETS
IS
MSG
NOW
I
LOOK
AT
ALL
LABELS
YOU
WOULD
BE
SURPRISED
AT
PLACES
YOU
FIND
MSG
