is
there
such
a
thing
as
msg
monosodium
glutamate
sensitivity
i
saw
in
the
ny
times
sunday
that
scientists
have
testified
before
an
fda
advisory
panel
that
complaints
about
msg
sensitivity
are
superstition
anybody
here
have
experience
to
the
contrary
i
know
that
there
is
msg
sensitivity
when
i
eat
foods
with
msg
i
get
very
thirsty
and
my
hands
swell
and
get
a
terrible
itchy
rash
i
first
experienced
this
problem
when
i
worked
close
to
chinatown
and
ate
chinese
food
almost
everyday
for
lunch
now
i
cant
tolerate
msg
at
all
i
can
notice
immediately
when
i
have
eaten
any
i
try
to
avoid
msg
completely
interesting
fact
though
is
that
all
three
of
my
children
started
experiencing
the
exact
same
rash
on
their
hands
i
couldnt
understand
why
because
i
dont
msg
in
cooking
and
we
ask
for
no
msg
when
we
do
eat
chinese
i
still
love
it
after
some
investigation
i
knew
that
oodles
of
noodles
where
one
of
their
favorite
foods
one
of
the
main
ingredients
in
the
flavor
packets
is
msg
now
i
look
at
all
labels
you
would
be
surprised
at
places
you
find
msg
