WRITES
IS
THERE
A
RIGHTEYE
DOMINANCE
EYEDNESS
AS
THERE
IS
AN
OVERALL
RIGHTHANDEDNESS
IN
THE
POPULATION
I
MEAN
DO
MOST
PEOPLE
REQUIRE
LESS
LENS
CORRECTIONS
FOR
THE
ONE
EYE
THAN
THE
OTHER
IF
SO
WHAT
KINDS
OF
PERCENTAGES
CAN
BE
ATTACHED
TO
THIS
THANKS
YES
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
EYE
DOMINANCE
ALTHOUGH
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
DOMINANCE
REFERS
TO
PERSCRIPTION
STRENGTH
AS
I
RECALL
IF
YOU
SELECTIVELY
CLOSE
YOUR
DOMINANT
EYE
YOU
WILL
PERCIEVE
THAT
THE
IMAGE
SHIFTS

WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
IF
YOU
CLOSE
YOUR
OTHER
EYE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WHICH
EYE
IS
DOMINANT
IS
RELATED
TO
HANDEDNESS
BUT
I
CANT
RECALL
THE
RELATION
AT
THE
MOMENT
