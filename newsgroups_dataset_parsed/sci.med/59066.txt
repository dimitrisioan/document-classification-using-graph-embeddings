RELIEF
OF
PAIN
CAUSED
BY
CANCER
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
THE
PROPER
GROUP
TO
POST
THIS
TO
BUT
HERE
GOES
ANYWAY
ABOUT
FIVE
YEARS
AGO
MY
MOTHER
WAS
DIAGNOSED
WITH
HAVING
CANCER
IN
THE
LYMPH
NODES
UNDER
ONE
OF
HER
ARMS
AFTER
THE
DOCTORS
REMOVED
THE
CANCEROUS
AREA
SHE
HAD
FULL
MOVEMENT
OF
HER
ARM
WITH
ONLY
SLIGHT
ACHING
UNDER
HER
ARM
WHEN
SHE
MOVED
IT
OVER
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
NEXT
TWO
YEARS
THE
ACHING
GOT
MORE
SEVERE
AND
HER
COMPLAINING
TO
THE
DOCTORS
PRODUCED
THE
EXPLANATION
THAT
IT
WAS
SCAR
TISSUE
CAUSING
THE
PAIN
AT
THIS
TIME
HER
DOCTOR
SUGGESTED
THAT
SOME
PHYSIOTHERAPY
SHOULD
BE
EMPLOYED
TO
BREAK
UP
THE
SCAR
TISSUE
WHILE
ATTENDING
ONE
OF
HER
THERAPY
SESSIONS
WHILE
HER
ARM
WAS
BEING
MANIPULATED
SOME
DAMAGE
OCCURED
NERVE
WHICH
CAUSED
THE
LEVEL
OF
PAIN
TO
PERMANENTLY
INCREASE
SEVERLY
CONTROLLED
BY
TYLENOL
AND
SOME
LOSS
OF
USE
OF
THE
ARM
PALSIED
WRIST
AND
ALMOST
NO
OUTWARD
LATERAL
MOVEMENT
WITH
GREAT
PERSISTENCE
ON
HER
PART
THE
DOCTORS
LOOKED
FURTHER
INTO
THE
ISSUE
AND
DISCOVERED
THAT
NOT
ALL
OF
THE
CANCER
HAD
BEEN
REMOVED
AND
ANOTHER
TUMOR
HAD
GROWN
UNDER
THE
ARM
THIS
WAS
REMOVED
ALSO
BUT
THE
PAIN
IN
THE
ARM
HAS
NOT
DECREASED
THE
DOCTORS
ARE
NOT
SURE
EXACTLY
WHY
THE
PAIN
IS
PERSISTING
BUT
FEEL
SOME
SORT
OF
NERVE
DAMAGE
HAS
OCCURED
AND
THEY
HAVE
EMPLOYED
TYLENOL
AND
SOON
MORPHINE
TO
RELIEVE
THE
PAIN
SHE
HAS
TRIED
ACUPUNCTURE
BY
THIS
ONLY
PROVIDES
MINOR
REDUCTIONS
IN
PAIN
AND
IS
ONLY
SHORT
TERM
MY
QUESTIONS
ARE
HAS
ANYONE
HAS
HEARD
OF
SIMILAR
CASES
AND
WHAT
IF
ANYTHING
WAS
DONE
TO
REDUCE
THE
LEVELS
OF
PAIN
ARE
THEIR
METHODS
TO
BLOCK
NERVES
SO
THAT
THE
PAIN
CAN
BE
REDUCED
ARE
THEIR
METHODS
TO
RESTORE
NERVES
SO
THAT
LOSS
OF
ARM
FUNCTION
CAN
BE
RESTORED
ANY
GENERAL
SUGGESTIONS
ON
PAIN
REDUCTION
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
PLEASE
RESPOND
BY
EMAIL
BECAUSE
I
DO
NOT
ALWAYS
GET
CHANCE
TO
READ
THIS
GROUP
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
OF
SOME
LITERATURE
THAT
MAY
BE
USEFUL
TO
THIS
CASE
OR
ANOTHER
NEWSGROUP
THAT
I
SHOULD
BE
POSTING
THIS
TO
IT
WOULD
ALSO
BE
APPRECIATED
