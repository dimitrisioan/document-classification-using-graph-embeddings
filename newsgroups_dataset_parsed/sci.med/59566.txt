LEGALITY
OF
PLACEBOS
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
PLACEBOS
ARE
LEGAL
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
THAT
IF
AS
A
PATIENT
YOU
PURCHASE
A
DRUG
YOUVE
BEEN
PRESCRIBED
AND
ITS
JUST
SUGAR
OR
WHATEVER
THERES
A
FEW
LEGAL
COMPLICATIONS
THAT
ARISE
IF
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
WITH
A
CONDITION
AND
YOU
ARENT
GIVEN
ACCEPTED
TREATMENT
FOR
IT
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
INTENTIONAL
MEDICAL
MALPRACTICE
A
PLACEBO
SHOULD
FALL
LEGALLY
UNDER
THE
LABEL
OF
QUACKERY
WHY
NOT
GETTING
WHAT
YOU
PAY
FOR
DECEPTIVE
BAIT
AND
SWITCH
TO
AN
EXTREME
FALSE
ADVERTISING
WHAT
IF
MCDONALDS
DIDNT
PUT
PURE
BEEF
IN
THEIR
HAMBURGERS
SO
IM
MYSTIFIED
ARE
THESE
ASSUMPTIONS
ERRED
IF
THEY
ARENT
WHY
THE
HELL
CAN
A
DOCTOR
KNOWINGLY
OR
UNKNOWINGLY
PRESCRIBE
A
PLACEBO
