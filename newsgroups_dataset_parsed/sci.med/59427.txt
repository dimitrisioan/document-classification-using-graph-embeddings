I
AM
LOOKING
FOR

ON
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF

IN
DEALING
WITH
ARTHRITIS
I
KNOW
IN
ONE
CASE
A
OLD
PERSON
DEVELOPED
BRUISE
AT
THE
BASE
OF
HER
LEFT
THUMB
AFTER
WEARING
THE
COPPER
BRACELET
ON
HER
LEFT
WRIST
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
SHE
WAS
TOLD
THE
BRUISE
IS
NORMAL
AND
WOULD
DISAPPEAR
IS
THE
BRUISE
REASON
TO
BE
CONCERNED
SHOULD
THE
PERSON
DISCONTINUED
WEARING
THE
COPPER
BRACELET
