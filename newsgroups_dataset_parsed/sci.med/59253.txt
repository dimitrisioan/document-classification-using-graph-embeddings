adenocarcinoma
of
the
lungs
putting
aside
our
substantial
differences
id
like
to
ask
the
knowledgeable
ones
to
give
feedback
on
this
let
me
explain
one
of
my
family
members
last
week
was
discovered
to
have
a
brain
tumor
after
having
some
difficulties
with
walking
and
writing
she
is
years
old
otherwise
she
is
in
fine
health
the
discovery
was
made
via
cat
scans
she
then
had
mri
scans
done
where
small
cancerous
areas
were
discovered
in
her
lungs
biopsies
showed
it
to
be
adenocarcinoma
one
spot
is
in
the
lungs
and
another
in
the
pneumothorax
the
oncologists
believe
the
cancer
started
in
the
lungs
and
caused
the
brain
tumor
she
smoked
until
four
years
ago
anyway
id
like
feedback
as
to
what
adenocarcinoma
is
how
it
is
different
from
other
cancers
how
she
will
be
treated
luckily
the
tumor
is
right
below
the
skull
and
can
be
easily
removed
and
statistically
what
are
the
chances
for
full
remissionrecovery
