RE
HELP
FOR
KIDNEY
STONES
IF
YOU
THINK
YOU
HAVE
KIDNEY
STONES
OR
YOUR
DOCTOR
TELLS
YOU
THAT
YOU
DO
DEFINITELY
FOLLOW
UP
ON
IT
MY
SISTER
WAS
DIAGNOSED
WITH
KIDNEY
STONES
YEARS
AGO
AND
GIVEN
MEDICATION
TO
TAKE
TO
DISSOLVE
THEM
AFTER
THAT
FAILED
AND
SHE
CONTINUED
TO
BE
IN
GREAT
PAIN
THEY
DECIDED
SHE
HAD
ENDOMETRIOSIS
WHEN
THEY
DID
EXPLORATORY
SURGERY
THEY
DISCOVERED
SHE
HAD
A
TUMOR
WHICH
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
RHABDOMYOSARCOMA
A
VERY
RARE
AND
AGRESSIVE
CANCER
I
REALIZE
THIS
IS
NOT
WHAT
HAPPENS
IN
THE
MAJORITY
OF
CASES
BUT
YOU
NEVER
KNOW
WHAT
CAN
HAPPEN
AND
SHOULDNT
TAKE
CHANCES
