re
help
me
inject
the
best
way
of
self
injection
is
to
use
the
right
size
needle
and
choose
the
correct
spot
for
streptomycin
usually
given
intra
muscularly
use
a
thin
needle
guage
and
select
a
spot
on
the
upper
outer
thigh
no
major
nerves
or
blood
vessels
there
clean
the
area
with
antiseptic
before
injection
and
after
make
sure
to
inject
deeply
a
different
kind
of
pain
is
felt
when
the
needle
enters
the
muscle
contrasted
to
the
prick
when
it
pierces
the
skin
ps
try
to
go
to
a
doctor
selftreatment
and
selfinjection
should
be
avoided
as
far
as
possible
