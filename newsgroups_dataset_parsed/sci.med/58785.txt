DOUG
BANK
WRITES
HERE
IS
ANOTHER
ANECDOTAL
STORY
I
AM
A
PICKY
EATER
AND
NEVER
WANTED
TO
TRY
CHINESE
FOOD
HOWEVER
I
FINALLY
TRIED
SOME
IN
ORDER
TO
PLEASE
A
GIRL
I
WAS
SEEING
AT
THE
TIME
I
HAD
NEVER
HEARD
OF
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
SYNDROME
A
GROUP
OF
US
WENT
TO
THE
RESTAURANT
AND
ALL
SHARED
DIFFERENT
DISHES
IT
DIDNT
TASTE
GREAT
BUT
I
DECIDED
IT
WASNT
SO
BAD
WE
WENT
HOME
AND
WENT
TO
BED
EARLY
I
WOKE
UP
AT
AM
AND
PUKED
MY
GUTS
OUTS
I
THREW
UP
FOR
SO
LONG
THAT
IM
NOT
KIDDING
I
PULLED
A
MUSCLE
IN
MY
TONGUE
DRY
HEAVES
AND
EVERYTHING
NO
ONE
ELSE
GOT
SICK
AND
IM
NOT
ALLERGIC
TO
ANYTHING
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
SUFFICE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
WONT
GO
INTO
A
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
UNLESS
I
AM
PHYSICALLY
THREATENED
THE
SMELL
OF
THE
FOOD
MAKES
ME
ILL
AND
THAT
IS
A
PSYCHOLGICAL
REACTION
WHEN
I
HAVE
BEEN
DRAGGED
IN
TO
SUFFER
THROUGH
BEEF
AND
BROCCOLI
WITHOUT
ANY
SAUCES
I
INSIST
ON
NO
MSG
I
HAVENT
GOTTEN
SICK
YET
I
HAD
A
SIMILAR
REACTION
TO
CHINESE
FOOD
BUT
CAME
TO
A
COMPLETLY
DIFFERENT
CONCLUSION
IVE
EATEN
CHINESE
FOOD
FOR
AGES
AND
NEVER
HAD
PROBLEMS
I
WENT
WITH
SOME
CHINESE
MALAYSIAN
FRIENDS
TO
A
SWANKY
CHINSES
REST
AND
THEY
ORDERED
LOTS
OF
STUFF
I
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
BEFORE
THE
ONLY
THING
I
CAN
REMEMBER
OF
THAT
MEAL
WAS
THE
FIRST
COURSE
SCALLOPS
SERVED
IN
THE
SHELL
WITH
A
SOYTYPE
SAUCE
I
THOUGHT
WELL
IVE
ONLY
HAD
SCALLOPS
ONCE
AND
I
WAS
SICK
AFTER
BUT
THAT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
COINCIDENCE
THAT
NIGHT
AS
I
SAT
ON
THE
BATHROOM
FLOOR
SWEATING
AND
EMPTYING
MY
STOMACH
THE
HARD
WAY
I
DECIDED
I
WOULD
NEVER
TOUCH
ANOTHER
SCALLOP
I
MAY
NOT
BE
ALLERGIC
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
TAKE
THE
CHANCE
