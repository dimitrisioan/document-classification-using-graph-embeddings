who
are
we
kidding
the
new
england
medical
journal
in
ran
the
heading
ninety
percent
of
diseases
are
not
treatable
by
drugs
or
surgery
which
has
been
echoed
by
several
other
reports
no
wonder
mds
are
not
amused
with
alternative
medicine
since
the
magic
of
the
placebo
effect
would
award
alternative
practitioners
twice
the
success
rate
of
conventional
medicine
of
diseases
is
not
the
same
thing
as
of
patients
in
a
world
with
one
curable
disease
that
strikes
people
and
nine
incurable
diseases
which
strikes
one
person
each
medical
science
will
cure
of
the
patients
and
report
that
of
diseases
have
no
therapy
a
disease
would
be
counted
among
the
untreatable
if
nothing
better
than
a
placebo
were
known
of
course
mds
are
ethically
bound
to
not
knowingly
dispense
