was
with
no
relief

propranolol
is
a
homeopathic
dose
in
migraine
if
you
got
fatigued
at
that
level
it
is
unlikely
that
you
will
tolerate
enough
beta
blocker
to
help
you
if
we
go
the
antidepressant
route
what
is
it
likely
to
be
how
do
antidepressants
work
in
migraine
prophylaxis

dont
know
how
they
work
in
migraine
but
it
probably
has
something
to
do
with
seratonin
