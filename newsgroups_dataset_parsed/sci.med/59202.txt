S
SPENSER
ADEN
WROTE
INTERESTING
STATEMENTS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
OTHERWISE
IM
CERTAINLY
NOT
QUESTIONING
STEVES
CLAIMS
AS
FOR
ONE
I
AM
NOT
A
DOCTOR
AND
I
AGREE
THAT
FOODS
DONT
BRING
ON
THE
RECURRENCE
OF
CROHNS
BUT
INFLAMMATION
CAN
BE
EITHER
MILDLY
OR
DRASTICALLY
ENHANCED
DUE
TO
FOOD
THE
FEELING
OBOUT
THIS
HAS
CHANGED
IN
THE
GI
COMMUNITY
THE
CURRENT
FEELING
IS
THAT
INFLAMMATION
IS
NOT
INDUCED
BY
FOOD
THERE
IS
EVEN
EVIDENCE
THAT
PATIENTS
DEPRIVED
OF
FOOD
HAVE
MUCOSAL
ATROPHY
DUE
TO
LACK
OF
STIMULATION
OF
INTESTINAL
GROWTH
FACTORS
THERE
IS
NOW
INTEREST
IN
PROVIDING
SMALL
AMOUNTS
OF
NASOGASTRIC
FEEDING
TO
PATIENTS
ON
IV
NUTRITION
BUT
I
DIGRESS
SYMPTOMS
CAN
BE
DRASTICALLY
ENHANCED
BY
FOOD
BUT
NOT
INFLAMMATION
HAVING
HAD
ONE
MAJOR
OBSTRUCTION
RESULTING
IN
RESECTION
IS
THAT
A
GOOD
ENOUGH
CAVEAT
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
A
LOW
RESIDUE
DIET
IS
CALLED
FOR
BASICALLY
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
IF
THERE
IS
INFLAMMATION
OF
THE
GUT
WHICH
MAY
NOT
BE
REALIZED
BY
THE
PATIENT
ANY
RESIDUE
IN
THE
SYSTEM
CAN
BE
CAUGHT
IN
THE
FOLDS
OF
INFLAMMATION
AND
CONSTANTLY
IRRITATE
THUS
EXACERBATING
THE
PROBLEM
THEREFORE
ANYTHING
THAT
DOESNT
DIGEST
COMPLETELY
BY
THE
POINT
OF
COMMON
INFLAMMATION
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
WITH
WHAT
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
IS
TYPICAL
CROHNS
OF
THE
TERMINAL
ILEUM
MY
DIET
SHOULD
BE
LOW
RESIDUE
CONSISTING
OF
COMPLETELY
OUT
NEVER
AGAIN
ITEMS
O
CORN
KERNEL
HUSK
DOESNT
DIGEST
MOST
OF
US
KNOW
THIS
O
POPCORN
SAME
O
DRIED
DEHYDRATED
FRUIT
AND
FRUIT
SKINS
O
NUTS
VERY
TOUGH
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
GIVING
UP
SOME
FUDGE
THE
LOW
RESIDUE
DIET
IS
APPROPRIATE
FOR
YOU
IF
YOU
STILL
HAVE
OBSTRUCTIONS
AGAIN
IT
IS
NOT
FELT
THAT
FOOD
CAUSES
INFLAMMATION
THESE
FOODS
ARE
AVOIDED
BECAUSE
THEY
MAY
GET
STUCK
ID
GO
AHEAD
AND
HAVE
THE
FUDGE
THOUGH
DISCOURAGED
GREATLY
O
RAW
VEGETABLES
TOO
FIBROUS
O
WHEAT
AND
RAW
GRAIN
BREADS
O
EXOTIC
LETTUCE
ICEBERG
IS
OK
SINCE
ITS
APPARENTLY
MOSTLY
WATER
O
GREENS
TURNIP
MUSTARD
KALE
ETC
O
LITTLE
SEEDS
LIKE
SESAME
TRY
GETTING
AN
ARBYS
WITHOUT
IT
O
LONG
GRAIN
AND
WILD
RICE
HUSKY
O
BEANS
YOULL
GENERATE
ENOUGH
GAS
ALONE
WITHOUT
THEM
O
BASICALLY
ANYTHING
THAT
REQUIRES
HEAVY
DIGESTIVE
PROCESSING
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THE
MORE
PROCESSED
THE
FOOD
THE
BETTER
RATHER
IRONIC
IN
THIS
DAY
AND
AGE
THE
WHOLE
POINT
IS
PREVENTATIVE
YOU
WANT
TO
GIVE
YOUR
SYSTEM
AS
LITTLE
CHANCE
TO
INFLAME
AS
POSSIBLE
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
AMONG
THE
NUMEROUS
THINGS
THAT
WERE
HEAVILY
DISCOURAGED
I
ONLY
LISTED
A
FEW
TO
TRY
THE
ONES
I
WANTED
AND
SEE
HOW
I
FELT
IF
ITS
BAD
DONT
DO
IT
AGAIN
REMEMBER
THOUGH
THAT
THIS
WAS
WHILE
I
WAS
IN
REMISSION
FOR
VEGGIES
COOK
THE
DAYLIGHTS
OUT
OF
THEM
I
PREFER
STEAMING
I
THINK
ITS
COOKS
MORE
THOROUGHLY
YOURE
MILEAGE
MAY
VARY
AS
WITH
ANYTHING
ELSE
CHECK
WITH
YOUR
DOCTOR
DONT
JUST
TAKE
MY
WORD
BUT
THIS
IS
THE
INFO
IVE
BEEN
GIVEN
AND
IT
MAY
BE
A
STARTING
POINT
FOR
DISCUSSION
GOOD
LUCK
SPENCER
MAKES
AN
ESPECIALLY
GOOD
POINT
IN
HAVING
AN
OBSERVANT
AND
INFORMED
PATIENT
WOULD
THAT
MANY
PATIENTS
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
WHAT
CAUSES
THEM
PROBLEMS
THE
DIGESTIVE
PROCESSING
IDEA
IS
CHANGING
BUT
IF
A
FOOD
CAUSES
PROBLEMS
AVOID
THEM
BE
SURE
THAT
THE
FOODS
ARE
TESTED
A
SECOND
TIME
TO
BE
SURE
THE
FOOD
IS
A
REAL
CAUSE
CROHNS
COMMONLY
CAUSES
INTERMITTENT
SYMPTOMS
AND
SOME
PATIENTS
END
UP
WITH
SEVERLY
RESTRICTED
DIETS
THAT
TAKE
MONTHS
TO
RENORMALIZE
THERE
WAS
A
GOOD
ARTICLE
IN
THE
CCFA
NEWSLETTER
RECENTLY
THAT
DISCUSSED
THE
ISSUE
OF
DIETARY
RESTRICTION
OF
FIBER
IT
WOULD
BE
WORTH
READING
TO
ANYONE
WITH
AN
INTEREST
IN
CROHNS
AND
AS
I
ALWAYS
SAY
WHEN
DEALING
WITH
CROHNS
AS
DOES
SPENCER
GOOD
LUCK
