IS
SERIOUS
AS

THE
QUESTION
ON
ONE
HAND
YOU
STATE
THAT
THINGS
HAVE
CHANGED
DRAMATICALLY
BUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
NOTHING
YOU
CAN
THINK
OF
HAS
CHANGED
YOUR
GIRLFRIEND
SEEMS
TO
WANT
TO
SEE
A
COUNSELOR
BUT
YOU
DONT
ID
RECOMMEND
THAT
YOU
EXAMINE
YOUR
HESITATION
TO
SEE
A
COUNSELOR
ITS
A
VERY
GOOD
ENVIRONMENT
TO
EXAMINE
ISSUES
THE
FACT
OF
THE

IS
YOUR
GIRLFRIEND
HAS
A
DIFFERENT
PERCEPTION
