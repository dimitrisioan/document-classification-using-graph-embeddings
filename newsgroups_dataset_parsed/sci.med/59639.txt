does
the
thermoscan
instrument
really
work
it
is
supposed
to
give
you
a
fast
and
accurate
temperature
reading
in
the
ear
how
far
in
the
ear
does
one
have
to
insert
the
instrument
is
it
worth
the
it
is
currently
selling
for
no
they
do
not
work
well
my
doctor
started
using
one
recently
and
i
thought
the
concept
was
so
amazing
that
i
bought
one
too
the
thing
works
by
reading
the
infrared
emissions
from
the
ear
drum
the
ear
drum
is
hotter
than
the
ear
canal
walls
so
you
have
to
point
the
thing
very
carefully
this
means
tugging
on
the
top
of
the
ear
to
straighten
out
the
ear
canal
then
inserting
the
thing
snugly
then
pushing
a
button
unfortunately
there
are
many
things
that
can
go
wrong
it
is
almost
impossible
to
aim
the
thing
correctly
when
you
do
it
on
yourself
i
get
readings
which
differ
from
each
other
by
up
to
degrees
and
may
differ
from
an
oral
thermometer
by
up
to
degrees
i
talked
to
one
of
the
nurses
in
my
doctors
office
recently
about
this
and
she
said
she
didnt
like
them
either
for
same
reasons
she
did
give
me
some
instruction
on
how
to
tug
on
my
ear
and
what
correct
insertion
feels
like
but
she
said
she
thought
it
was
impossible
to
do
correctly
on
ones
self
she
also
said
that
she
and
other
nurses
had
complained
to
the
company
about
inaccurate
readings
and
that
someone
from
the
company
had
told
them
to
take
great
care
to
clean
the
infrared
window
at
the
end
of
the
probe
with
alcohol
from
time
to
time
she
demonstrated
this
prior
to
reading
my
temperature
and
managed
to
get
a
reading
within
degree
of
the
oral
temperature
i
took
at
home
before
driving
to
the
drs
office
i
have
also
noticed
tha
some
nurses
click
the
button
then
remove
the
probe
immediately
this
causes
wrong
readings
in
my
experience
you
have
to
leave
the
probe
in
a
good
to
seconds
after
clicking
the
button
to
get
a
good
measurement
the
nurse
i
talked
with
agreed
i
suspect
that
many
people
dont
realize
this
and
therefore
get
bad
readings
for
yet
another
reason
in
short
its
a
great
idea
it
may
work
for
some
folks
but
i
believe
it
doesnt
work
well
for
a
person
who
wants
to
take
his
own
temperature
