SEEKING
INFO
ON
RETINAL
DETACHMENT
I
AM
QUITE
NEAR
SIGHTED
IVE
RECENTLY
RECEIVED
LASER
TREATMENT
FOR
BOTH
EYES
TO
SEAL
HOLES
IN
THE
RETINAS
TO
HELP
PREVENT
RETINAL
DETACHMENT
IN
MY
LEFT
EYE
A
SMALL
DETACHMENT
HAD
BEGUN
ALREADY
AND
APPARENTLY
THE
LASER
WAS
USED
TO
WELD
THIS
BACK
IN
PLACE
AS
WELL
MY
RIGHT
EYE
SEEMS
FINE
IN
MY
LEFT
EYE
I
WAS
SEEING
OCCASIONAL
FLASHES
OF
BRIGHT
LIGHT
PRIOR
TO
THE
TREATMENT
SINCE
THE
TREATMENT
TWO
WEEKS
THESE
FLASHES
ARE
NOW
OCCURING
MORE
OFTEN
SEVERAL
EACH
HOUR
THE
OPTHAMOLOGIST
EXPLAINED
THE
FLASHES
ARE
CAUSED
BECAUSE
THE
VITREOUS
BODY
HAS
ATTACHED
TO
THE
RETINA
AND
IS
PULLING
ON
IT
HE
SAYS
THIS
IS
NOT
TREATABLE
AND
HE
HOPES
IT
MAY
GO
AWAY
ON
ITS
OWN
ACCORD
IF
IT
TUGS
ENOUGH
I
MAY
WELL
FACE
RETINAL
DETACHMENT
I
AM
SEEKING
VIA
SCIMED
ADDITIONAL
INFO
ON
RETINAL
DETACHMENTS
THE
DR
DID
NOT
WISH
TO
SPEND
MUCH
TIME
WITH
ME
IN
EXPLANATIONS
SO
I
APPRECIATE
ANY
FURTHER
DETAILS
ANYONE
CAN
PROVIDE
OF
MOST
INTEREST
TO
ME
IF
MY
RETINA
DOES
DETACH
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
MY
IMMEDIATE
COURSE
OF
ACTION
IF
CONVENTIONAL
SURGERY
IS
NEED
TO
REPAIR
THE
DETACHMENT
WHAT
IS
THE
PROCEDURE
LIKE
AND
WHAT
KIND
OF
VISION
CAN
I
EXPECT
AFTERWARDS
DO
THE
SYMPTOMS
FAIRLY
FREQUENT
FLASHES
IMPLY
THAT
DETACHMENT
MAYBE
NEAR
AT
HAND
OR
IS
THIS
NOT
NECESSARILY
CAUSE
FOR
ALARM
MANY
THANKS
