WHO
ARE
NOT
CITIZENS
ARE
LIKE
ALL
ALIENS
IN
A
DIFFICULT
SITUATION
ONLY
CITIZENS
GET
TO
VOTE
HERE
SO
NONCITIZENS
ARE
OF
LITTLE
OR
NO
INTEREST
TO
LEGISLATORS
ALSO
THE
NONCITIZEN
MAY
WELL
BE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
PROCESSING
FOR
RESIDENT
ALIEN
STATUS
THERE
IS
A
STRON
SENSE
THAT
ROCKING
THE
BOAT
EG
SUING
A
RESIDENCY
PROGRAM
WILL
DELAY
THE
GRANTING
OF
THAT
STATUS
PERHAPS
FOR
EVER

SHOULD
BE
AWARE
THAT
FOREIGN
DOCTORS
ADMITTED
FOR
TRAINING
ARE
INELIGIBLE
TO
APPLY
FOR

TO
THEIR
COUNTRY

THAT
DISTRICT
TACKS
A
RIDER
ONTO
A
BILL
SAYING
DR

WILL
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
PERMANENT
RESIDENCY
IN
THE
US
A
LOT
OF
BILLS
IN
CONGRESS
HAVE
SUCH
RIDERS
ATTACHED
TO
THEM
MARRYING
A
US
CITIZEN
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
ALTHOUGH
NOW
THEY
ARE
EVEN
CRACKING
DOWN
ON
THAT
AND
TRYING
TO
TELL
US
CITIZENS
THEY
MUST
FOLLOW
THEIR
SPOUSE
BACK
TO
THE
PHILLIPINES
OR
WHEREEVER
