WRITES
I
LIVE
AT
SEALEVEL
AND
AM
CALLEDUPON
TO
TRAVEL
TO
HIGHALTITUDE
CITIES
QUITE
FREQUENTLY
ON
BUSINESS
THE
CITIES
IN
QUESTION
ARE
AT
TO
FEET
OF
ALTITUDE
ONE
OF
THEM
ESPECIALLY
IS
VERY
POLLUTED
MEXICO
CITY
BOGOTA
LA
PAZ
OFTEN
I
FEEL
FAINT
THE
FIRST
TWO
OR
THREE
DAYS
I
FEEL
LIGHTHEADED
AND
MY
HEART
SEEMS
TO
POUND
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
AT
SEALEVEL
ALSO
IT
IS
VERY
DRY
IN
THESE
CITIES
SO
I
WILL
TEND
TO
DRINK
A
LOT
OF
WATER
AND
KEEP
AWAY
FROM
DEHYDRATING
DRINKS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
CONTAINING
CAFFEINE
OR
ALCOHOL
THING
IS
I
STILL
HAVE
SYMPTOMS
HOW
CAN
I
ENSURE
THAT
MY
SHORT
TRIPS
THERE
NO
I
DONT
USUALLY
HAVE
A
WEEK
TO
ACCLIMATIZE
ARE
AS
COMFORTABLE
AS
POSSIBLE
IS
THERE
SOMETHING
ELSE
THAT
I
COULD
DO
GO
THREE
DAYS
EARLY
PRELIMINARY
ACCLIMATIZATION
TAKES
DAYS
IT
TAKES
WEEKS
OR
MONTHS
FOR
FULL
ACCLIMATIZATION
COULD
YOU
BE
EXPERIENCING
SOME
JET
LAG
TOO
