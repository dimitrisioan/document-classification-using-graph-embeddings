WRITES
SOME
RECENT
POSTINGS
REMIND
ME
THAT
I
HAD
READ
ABOUT
RISKS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
BARBECUING
OF
FOODS
NAMELY
THAT
CARCINOGENS
ARE
GENERATED
IS
THIS
A
VALID
CONCERN
IF
SO
IS
IT
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
SMOKE
OR
THE
ELEVATED
TEMPERATURES
IS
IT
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
COOKING
ELEMENTS
WOOD
OR
CHARCOAL

LAVA
ROCKS
