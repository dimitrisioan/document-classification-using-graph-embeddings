re
teenage
acne

my
son
has
the
usual
teenage
spotty
chin
and
greasy
nose
i
bought
him
clearasil
face
wash
and
ointment
i
think
that
is
probably
enough
along
with
the
usual
good
diet
however
he
is
on
at
me
to
get
some
product
called
dalacin
t
which
used
to
be
a
doctorsprescription
only
treatment
but
is
not
available
over
the
chemists
counter
i
have
asked
a
couple
of
pharmacists
who
say
either
his
acne
is
not
severe
enough
for
dalacin
t
or
that
clearasil
is
ok
i
had
the
odd
spots
as
a
teenager
nothing
serious
his
father
was
the
same
so
i
dont
figure
his
acne
is
going
to
escalate
into
something
disfiguring
but
i
know
kids
are
senstitive
about
their
appearance
i
am
wary
because
a
neighbours
son
had
this
wierd
malady
that
was
eventually
put
down
to
an
overdose
of
vitamin
a
from
acne
treatment
i
want
to
help
but
with
appropriate
treatment
my
son
also
has
some
scaliness
around
the
hairline
on
his
scalp
sort
of
teenage
cradle
cap
any
pointersadvice
on
this
we
have
tried
a
couple
of
anti
dandruff
shampoos
and
some
of
these
are
inclined
to
make
the
condition
worse
not
better
shall
i
bury
the
kid
till
hes
noi
was
one
of
the
lucky
ones
very
little
acne
as
a
teenager
i
didnt
have
any
luck
with
clearasil
even
though
my
skin
gets
oily
it
really
only
gets
miserable
pimples
when
its
dry
frequent
lukewarm
water
rinses
on
the
face
might
help
getting
the
scalp
thing
under
control
might
help
that
could
be
as
simple
as
submerging
under
the
bathwater
till
its
softened
and
washing
it
out
taking
a
one
a
day
vitaminmineral
might
help
ive
heard
iodine
causes
trouble
and
that
it
is
used
in
fast
food
restaurants
to
sterilize
equipment
which
might
be
where
the
belief
that
greasy
foods
cause
acne
came
from
i
notice
grease
on
my
face
not
immediately
removed
will
cause
acne
even
from
eating
meat
keeping
hair
rinse
mousse
dip
and
spray
off
the
face
will
help
warm
water
bath
soaks
or
cloths
on
the
face
to
soften
the
oil
in
the
pores
will
help
prevent
blackheads
body
oil
is
hydrophilic
loves
water
and
it
softens
and
washes
off
when
it
has
a
chance
thats
why
hair
goes
limp
with
oilyness
becoming
convinced
that
the
best
thing
to
do
with
a
whitehead
is
leave
it
alone
will
save
him
days
of
pimple
misery
any
prying
of
black
or
whiteheads
can
cause
infections
the
red
spots
of
pimples
usually
a
whitehead
will
break
naturally
in
a
day
and
there
wont
be
an
infection
afterwards
tell
him
that
its
normal
to
have
some
pimples
but
the
cosmetic
industry
makes
its
money
off
of
selling
people
on
the
idea
that
they
are
an
incredible
defect
to
be
hidden
at
any
cost
even
that
of
causing
more
pimples
