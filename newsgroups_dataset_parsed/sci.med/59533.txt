re
antihistamine
for
sleep
aid
im
interested
in
this
from
the
other
angle
what
antihistamine
can
i
take
at
bedtime
for
relief
of
allergies
with
the
assurance
that
its
sedative
effect
will
have
completely
worn
off
by
the
next
morning
but
preferably
with
the
antiallergy
effect
lasting
longer
im
thinking
mainly
of
otc
products
which
has
the
least
duration
of
sedative
action
benadryl
chlortrimeton
or
what
note
that
im
asking
about
duration
not
intensity
