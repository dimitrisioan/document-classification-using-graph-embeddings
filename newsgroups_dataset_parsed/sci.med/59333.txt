GORDEN
RUBENFELD
THROUGH
EMAIL
HAS
ASSURED
ME
THAT
MOST
PHYSICIANS
RECOGNIZE
THE
CHANCE
OF
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
OCCURING
AFTER
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
AND
THEY
THEREFORE
REINNOCULATE
THEIR
PATIENTS
WITH
GOOD
BACTERIA
TO
RESTORE
COMPETETION
FOR
CANDIDA
IN
THE
BODY
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
YET
A
STANDARD
PART
OF
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
NOR
IS
IT
MINE
WHAT
I
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
TO
MARTY
WAS
THAT
IT
IS
CLEARLY
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
ANTIBIOTIC
EXPOSURE
IS
A
RISK
FACTOR
FOR
FUNGAL
INFECTIONS
WHICH
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
SAYING
BACTERIA
PREVENT
FUNGAL
INFECTIONS
MARTY
MADE

HOWEVER
IT
IS

TO

I
HAVE

CLINICAL

TO
YOU
GORDON
I
THINK
THAT
THE
BEST
CLINICAL
TRIAL
FOR
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
WOULD
INVOLVE
GIVING
WOMEN
WITH
CHRONIC
VAGINAL
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
L
ACIDOPHILUS
ORALLY
AND
SEE
IT
IT
CAN
DECREASE
THE
FREQUENCY
AND
EXTENT
OF
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IN
THE
VAGINA
SINCE
MOST
OF
THE
CANDIDA
SEEMS
TO
BE
MIGRATING
IN
FROM
THE
ANAL
REGION
AND
L
ACIDOPHILUS
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
KEEP
THE
CANDIDA
IN
CHECK
IF
IT
CAN
MAKE
IT
THROUGH
THE
INTESTINAL
TRACT
AND
COLONIZE
IN
THE
ANUS
WHERE
IT
WILL
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
OXYGENJUST
LIKE
IT
DOES
IN
THE
VAGINA
AS
MUCH
STUFF
AS
THERE
IS
IN
THE
LAY
PRESS
ABOUT
L
ACIDOPHILUS
AND
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
IM
REALLY
AMAZED
THAT
SOMEONE
HAS
NOT
DONE
A
CLINICAL
TRIAL
YET
TO
CHECK
IT
OUT
THE
CALCIUM
AND
KIDNEY
STONE
STORY
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
THROW
ALL
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
OUT
THE
WINDOW
WHERE
WOULD
MEDICINE
BE
IF
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
HAD
NOT
BEEN
USED
TO
DEVELOP
MANY
OF
THE
STANDARD
MEDICAL
PRACTICES
THAT
COULD
NOT
BE
CONFIRMED
THROUGH
CLINICAL
TRIALS
THE
CLINICAL
TRIAL
IS
A
VERY
NEW
ARRIVAL
ON
THE
MEDICAL
SCENEAND
A
VERY
IMPORTANT
ONE
THE
LACK
OF
PROOF
THAT
REINNOCULATION
WITH
GOOD
BACTERIA
AFTER
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
THE
HEALTH
OF
A
PATIENT
IS
NO
REASON
TO
DISMISS
IT
OUTOFHAND
ESPECIALLY
IF
