writes
to
candida
blooms
following
the
use
of
broadspectrum
antibiotics
gorden
rubenfeld
through
email
has
assured
me
that
most
physicians
recognize
the
chance
of
candida
blooms
occuring
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
and
they
therefore
reinnoculate
their
patients
with
good
bacteria
to
restore
competetion
for
candida
in
the
body
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
yet
a
standard
part
of
medical
practice
nor
is
it
mine
what
i
tried
to
explain
to
marty
was
that
it
is
clearly
understood
that
antibiotic
exposure
is
a
risk
factor
for
fungal
infections
which
is
not
the
same
as
saying
bacteria
prevent
fungal
infections
marty
made
this
sound
like
a
secret
known
only
to
veternarians
and
biochemists
anyone
who
has
treated
a
urinary
tract
infection
knowns
this
at
some
centers
preop
liver
transplant
patients
receive
bowel
decontamination
directed
at
retaining
good
anaerobic
flora
in
an
attempt
to
prevent
fungal
colonization
in
this
soontobe
high
risk
group
i
also
use
lactobacillus
to
treat
enteral
nutrition
associated
diarrhea
that
may
be
in
part
due
to
alterations
in
gut
flora
however
it
is
not
part
of
my
routine
practice
to
reinnoculate
patients
with
good
bacteria
after
antibiotics
i
have
seen
no
data
on
this
practice
preventing
or
treating
fungal
infections
in
at
risk
patients
whether
or
not
it
is
a
logical
extension
from
the
available
observations
ill
leave
to
those
of
you
who
base
strong
opinions
and
argue
over
such
speculations
in
the
absence
of
clinical
trials
one
place
such
therapy
has
been
described
is
in
treating
particularly
recalcitrant
cases
of
c
difficile
colitis
not
a
fungal
infection
there
are
case
reports
of
using
stool
ie
someone
elses
enemas
to
repopulate
the
patients
flora
dont
try
this
at
home
not
give
give
her
advise
to
use
the
otc
antifungal
creams
since
candida
colonizes
primarily
in
the
anorectal
area
gi
symptoms
should
be
more
common
than
vaginal
problems
after
broadspectrum
antibiotic
use
except
that
it
isnt
at
least
symptomatically
apparent
disease
medicine
has
not
and
probalby
never
will
be
practiced
this
way
there
has
always
been
the
use
of
conventional
wisdom
a
very
good
example
is
kidney
stones
conventional
wisdombecause
clinical
trails
have
not
been
done
to
come
up
with
an
effective
prevention
was
that
restricitng
the
intake
of
calcium
and
oxalates
was
the
best
way
to
prevent
kidney
stones
from
forming
clinical
trials
focused
on
drugs
or
ultrasonic
blasts
to
breakdown
the
stone
once
it
formed
through
the
recent
new
england
j
of
medicine
article
we
now
know
that
conventional
wisdom
was
wrong
increasing
calcium
intake
is
better
at
preventing
stone
formation
than
is
restricting
calcium
intake
seems
like
this
is
an
excellent
argument
for
ignoring
anecdotal
conventional
wisdom
a
euphemism
for
no
data
and
doing
a
good
clinical
trial
like
au
dismukeswe
wadejs
leejy
dockerybk
hainjd
ti
a
randomized
doubleblind
trial
of
nystatin
therapy
for
the
candidiasis
hypersensitivity
syndrome
see
comments
so
nengljmed
dec
p
psychological
tests
results
the
three
activetreatment
regimens
and
the
allplacebo
regimen
significantly
reduced
both
vaginal
and
systemic
symptoms
p
less
than
but
nystatin
did
not
reduce
the
systemic
symptoms
significantly
more
than
placebo
conclusions
in
women
with
presumed
candidiasis
hypersensitivity
syndrome
nystatin
does
not
reduce
systemic
or
psychological
symptoms
significantly
more
than
placebo
consequently
the
empirical
recommendation
of
longterm
nystatin
therapy
for
such
women
appears
to
be
unwarranted
does
this
trial
address
every
issue
raised
here
no
jon
noring
was
not
surprised
at
this
negative
trial
since
they
didnt
use
sporanox
despite
crooks
recommendation
for
nystatin
maybe
they
didnt
avoid
those
carbohydrates
the
conventional
wisdom
in
animal
husbandry
has
been
that
animals
need
to
be
reinnoculated
with
good
bacteria
after
coming
off
antibiotic
therapy
if
it
makes
sense
for
livestock
why
doesnt
it
make
sense
for
humans
david
we
are
not
talking
about
a
dangerous
treatmentunless
you
consider
yogurt
dangerous
if
this
were
a
standard
part
of
medical
practice
as
gordon
r
says
it
is
then
the
incidence
of
gi
distress
and
vaginal
yeast
infections
should
decline
marty
youve
also
changed
the
terrain
of
the
discussion
from
empiric
itraconazole
for
undocumented
chronic
fungal
sinusitis
with
systemic
hypersensitivity
symptoms
noring
syndrome
to
the
yoghurt
and
vitamin
therapy
of
undocumented
candida
enteritis
elaine
palmer
syndrome
with
systemic
symptoms
there
is
significant
difference
between
the
cost
and
risk
of
these
two
empiric
therapeutic
trials
are
we
talking
about
real
candida
infections
the
whole
yeast
connection
hypothesis
the
efficacy
of
routine
bacterial
repopulation
in
humans
or
the
ability
of
anecdotally
effective
therapies
challenged
by
a
negative
randomized
trial
to
confirm
an
etiologic
hypothesis
post
hoc
ergo
propter
hoc
we
cant
seem
to
focus
in
on
a
disease
a
therapy
or
a
hypothesis
under
discussion
im
lost
candida
can
do
that
to
you
gordon
i
think
that
the
best
clinical
trial
for
candida
blooms
would
involve
giving
women
with
chronic
vaginal
candida
blooms
l
acidophilus
orally
and
see
it
it
can
decrease
the
frequency
and
extent
of
candida
blooms
in
the
vagina
since
most
of
the
candida
seems
to
be
migrating
in
from
the
anal
region
and
l
acidophilus
should
be
able
keep
the
candida
in
check
if
it
can
make
it
through
the
intestinal
tract
and
colonize
in
the
anus
where
it
will
have
access
to
oxygenjust
like
it
does
in
the
vagina
as
much
stuff
as
there
is
in
the
lay
press
about
l
acidophilus
and
vaginal
yeast
infections
im
really
amazed
that
someone
has
not
done
a
clinical
trial
yet
to
check
it
out
the
calcium
and
kidney
stone
story
is
not
a
good
reason
to
throw
all
conventional
wisdom
out
the
window
where
would
medicine
be
if
conventional
wisdom
had
not
been
used
to
develop
many
of
the
standard
medical
practices
that
could
not
be
confirmed
through
clinical
trials
the
clinical
trial
is
a
very
new
arrival
on
the
medical
sceneand
a
very
important
one
the
lack
of
proof
that
reinnoculation
with
good
bacteria
after
antibiotic
use
is
important
to
the
health
of
a
patient
is
no
reason
to
dismiss
it
outofhand
especially
if
reinnoculation
can
be
done
cleaply
and
safelylike
it
is
in
animal
husbandry
