ORGAN
DONORS
ARE
HEALTHY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
DIED
SUDDENLY
USUALLY
THROUGH
ACCIDENT
OR
HEAD
INJURY
THEY
ARE
BRAIN
DEAD
THE
ORGANS
ARE
KEPT
ALIVE
THROUGH
MECHANICAL
MEANS
OK
SO
HOW
DO
YOU
DEFINE
HEALTHY
PEOPLE
MY
WIFE
CANNOT
DONATE
BLOOD
BECAUSE
SHE
HAS
BEEN
TO
A
MALARIAL
REGION
IN
THE
PAST
THREE
YEARS
IN
FACT
SHE
TRIED
TO
HAVE
HER
BONE
MARROW
TYPED
AND
THEY
WOULDNT
EVEN
DO
THAT
WHY
I
CANT
DONATE
BLOOD
EITHER
BECAUSE
NOT
ONLY
HAVE
I
BEEN
TO
A
MALARIAL
REGION
BUT
I
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
AND
SURGICALLY
TREATED
FOR
TESTICULAR
CANCER
THE
BLOOD
BANK
WONT
ACCEPT
BLOOD
FROM
ME
FOR
YEARS
OBVIOUSLY
IT
WOULDNT
BE
OF
MUCH
HELP
TO
TREAT
ONE
PROBLEM
BY
KNOWINGLY
INTRODUCING
ANOTHER
CANCER
MESTASTIZES
MY
IMPERFECT
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
FACTS
ARE
THAT
GONADAL
CANCER
IS
PARTICULARLY
DANGEROUS
IN
THIS
REGARD
I
HAVENT
DONE
THE
RESEARCH
ON
IT
BUT
I
DONT
RECALL
EVER
HEARING
OF
A
CASE
OF
CANCER
BEING
TRANSMITTED
BY
A
BLOOD
TRANSFUSION
PROBABLY
JUST
A
COMMON
SENSE
KIND
OF
ARBITRARY
PRECAUTION
TRANSMISSABLE
DISEASES
LIKE
MALARIA
THOUGH
ARE
OBVIOUSLY
ANOTHER
STORY
