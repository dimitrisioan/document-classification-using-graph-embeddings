i
heard
that
a
certain
disease
toxoplasmosys
is
transmitted
by
cats
which
can
harm
the
unborn
fetus
does
anybody
know
about
it
is
it
a
problem
to
have
a
cat
in
the
same
apartment
the
disease
you
are
talking
about
is
toxoplasmosis
it
is
a
protozoan
that
lives
and
multiplies
within
cells
in
cats
the
protozoan
multiplies
in
the
intestinal
cells
and
eggs
are
shed
in
the
cats
feces
the
protozoa
can
cross
the
placenta
to
infect
the
fetus
the
disease
may
be
asymptomatic
after
the
baby
is
born
or
it
may
be
very
severe
toxo
may
cause
blindness
and
mental
retardation
having
a
cat
in
the
same
apartment
should
not
be
a
problem
however
pregnant
women
should
not
scoop
or
change
the
cats
litterbox
in
addition
whoever
does
empty
the
litterbox
should
thoroughly
wash
hisher
hands
before
handling
anything
else
especially
food
information
came
from
the
merck
manual
ed
i
hope
this
information
is
helpful
to
you
