RE
REUSE
OF
HALDOL
AND
THE
ELDERLY
IN
ARTICLE
PICL
WRITES
ADULTS
THE
CHANGE
IN
ENVIRONMENT
CAN
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
ANESTHETIC
AGENTS
CAN
CAUSE
CONFUSION
BECAUSE
THE
BODY
CANNOT
CLEAR
THE
MEDICINES
OUT
OF
THE
BODY
AS
EASILY
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
DID
NOT
SAY
WHY
HIS
MOTHER
HAD
BEEN
IN
HOSPITAL
BUT
I
CAN
ANSWER
A
FEW
GENERAL
POINTS
ELDERLY
PATIENTS
MAY
EXHIBIT
A
MARKED
DIFFICULTY
IN
COPING
AFTER
BEING
IN
HOSPITAL
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
THE
DRASTIC
CHANGE
OF
ENVIRONMENT
WILL
OFTEN
UNMASK
HOW
MARGINALLY
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
COPING
AT
HOME
EVEN
YOUNG
PEOPLE
FIND
THE
CHANGE
UNSETTLING
THOUGH
WE
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
DECREMENT
IN
FUNCTION
AFTER
SAY
ANAESTHESIA
AND
SURGERY
FOR
A
FRACTURED
HIP
A
COMMON
EVENT
IN
THE
ELDERLY
WAS
DUE
TO
ANAESTHESIA
THERE
IS
GOOD
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
CHANGE
OF
SITUATION
IS
MUCH
MORE
IMPORTANT
SOME
HOSPITALS
HAVE
TRIED
A
RAPID
TRANSIT
SYSTEM
FOR
HIP
FRACTURES
AIMING
TO
HAVE
THE
PATIENT
BACK
AT
HOME
WITHIN
HOURS
OF
ADMISSION
THE
SELECTION
OF
THE
ANAESTHETIC
HAS
NO
EFFECT
ON
THE
ABILITY
TO
DISCHARGE
THESE
PATIENTS
EARLY
ANAESTHETISTS
WHO
WORK
WITH
THE
ELDERLY
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
ALL
OF
US
GENERALLY
TAKE
CARE
TO
TAILOR
THE
CHOICE
AND
DOSE
OF
DRUGS
USED
TO
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PATIENT
EVEN
SO
THERE
IS
SOME
EVIDENCE
THAT
FULL
MENTAL
RECOVERY
MAY
TAKE
A
SURPRISINGLY
LONG
TIME
TO
RETURN
THIS
IS
THE
SORT
OF
THING
WHICH
IS
DETECTED
BY
SETTING
QUITE
DIFFICULT
TASKS
NOT
THE
GROSS
CHANGE
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
NOTED
HALOPERIDOL
HALDOL
TM
IS
A
LONG
ACTING
DRUG
THE
PLASMA
HALF
LIFE
OF
THE
DRUG
IS
UP
TO
HOURS
IF
THE
DECANOATE
A
SORT
OF
SLOW
RELEASE
FORMULATION
IS
USED
IT
MAY
BE
WEEKS
THE
ELDERLY
ARE
SENSITIVE
TO
HALOPERIDOL
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
WITHOUT
KNOWING
MORE
IT
IS
HARD
TO
COMMENT
DON
MACKIE
HIS
OPINIONS
