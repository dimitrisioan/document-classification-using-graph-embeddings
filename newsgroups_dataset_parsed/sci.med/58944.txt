re
post
polio
syndrome
information
needed
please
dn
from
nyedacnsvaxuwecedu
david
nye
dn
briefly
this
is
a
condition
in
which
patients
who
have
significant
dn
residual
weakness
from
childhood
polio
notice
progression
of
the
dn
weakness
as
they
get
older
one
theory
is
that
the
remaining
motor
dn
neurons
have
to
work
harder
and
so
die
sooner
if
this
theory
were
true
the
muscle
biopsy
would
show
group
atrophy
evidence
of
acute
loss
of
enlarged
motor
units
it
doesnt
instead
the
biopsy
shows
scattered
angulated
atrophic
fibers
this
is
more
consistent
with
loadshedding
by
chronically
overworked
motor
neurons
the
neurons
survive
at
the
expense
of
increasingly
denervated
muscle
