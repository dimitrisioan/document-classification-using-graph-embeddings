i
managed
to
dislocate
my
shoulder
while
sking
the
injury
also
seems
to
have
damaged
the
nerves
in
my
arm
i
was
wondering
if
someone
could
point
me
towards
some
literature
that
would
give
me
some
background
into
these
types
of
injuries
please
respond
by
email
if
possible
your
medical
school
library
should
have
books
on
peripheral
nerve
injuries
probably
it
was
your
brachial
plexus
so
look
that
up
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
gebcadredslpittedu
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
