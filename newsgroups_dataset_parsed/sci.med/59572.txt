CLAUDE
BOWIE
WRITES
I
HEARD
A
NEWS
REPORT
INDICATING
RESEARCH
SHOWING
IMPROVED
HEARING
IN
PEOPLE
TAKING
VITAMIN
A
THE
RESEARCH
SHOWED
THAT
NEW
GROWTH
REPLACED
DAMAGED
HAIRLIKE
NERVES
HAS
ANYONE
HEARD
ABOUT
THIS
CLAUDE
IVE
NOT
HEARD
OR
READ
ANYTHING
THAT
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
VITAMIN
A
RETINOL
COULD
REVERSE
HEARING
LOSS
DUE
TO
NERVE
DAMAGEUSUALLY
CAUSED
BY
HIGH
SOUND
LEVELS
BUT
ALSO
OCCASSIONALLY
DUE
TO
SEVERE
INFECTION
THE
TYPES
OF
CELLS
THAT
VITAMIN
A
REGULATES
ARE
THE
GENERAL
EPITHELIAL
CELLS
AND
THESE
CELL
TYPES
ARE
NOT
THE
ONES
THAT
FUNCTION
IN
THE
EAR
HEARING
PROCESS
THE
HAIR
CELL
NERVELIKE
EPITHELIAL
CELLS
IN
THE
EAR
MAY
RESPOND
TO
VITAMIN
A
DURING
CELLULAR
DIFFERENTIATIONEMBRYOGENESIS
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THEY
ARE
STILL
CAPABLE
OF
RESPONDING
IN
ADULTS
IF
THEY
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
RESPONDING
WITH
NEW
HAIR
GROWTH
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
VERY
MAJOR
BREAKTHROUGH
IN
HEARING
LOSS
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
MEDICAL
INTEREST
IN
VITAMIN
A
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
TOO
SURPRISING
IF
A
CLINICAL
STUDY
WAS
DONE
USING
VITAMIN
A
TO
REVERSE
HEARING
LOSS
BUT
WITH
ONLY
A
NEWS
ANNOUNCEMENT
TO
GO
ONAND
THIS
TYPE
OF
COMMUNICATION
IS
NOTORIOUSLY
BAD
I
CANT
COMMENT
ON
YOUR
QUESTION
ANYMORE
THAN
I
ALREADY
HAVE
IF
ONE
STUDY
HAS
BEEN
DONE
MORE
WILL
NEED
TO
FOLLOW
TO
FIRM
UP
A
LINK
BETWEEN
VITAMIN
A
AND
HEARING
LOSS
IF
THERE
REALLY
IS
ONE
