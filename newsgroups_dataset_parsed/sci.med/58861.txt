WRITES
I
AM
POSTING
TO
THIS
GROUP
IN
HOPES
OF
FINDING
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
IN
NETWORK
NEWSLAND
WHO
HAS
HEARD
OF
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
TO
WHAT
I
AM
GOING
TO
DESCRIBE
HERE
I
HAVE
A
FOURTEEN
YEAR
OLD
DAUGTER
WHO
EXPERIENCED
A
SEIZURE
ON
NOVEMBER
AT
AFTER
EATING
KELLOGS
FROSTED
FLAKES
SHE
IS
PERFECTLY
HEALTHY
HAD
NEVER
EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING
LIKE
THIS
BEFORE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
HISTORY
OF
SEIZURES
IN
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
FAMILY
ALL
THE
TESTS
EEG
MRI
EKG
CAME
OUT
NEGATIVE
SO
THE
DECISION
WAS
MADE
TO
DO
NOTHING
AND
JUST
WAIT
TO
SEE
IF
IT
HAPPENED
AGAIN
WELL
WE
WERE
GOING
ALONG
FINE
AND
THE
OTHER
MORNING
APRIL
SHE
HAD
A
BOWL
OF
ANOTHER
KELLOGS
FROSTED
KIND
OF
CEREAL
FRUIT
LOOPS
I
AM
EMBARRASSED
TO
ADMIT
THAT
I
EVEN
BOUGHT
THAT
JUNK
BUT
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
SO
I
POUR
IT
IN
HER
BOWL
AND
THINK
OH
OH
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
JUNK
SHE
WAS
EATING
WHEN
SHE
HAD
THAT
SEIZURE
TEN
MINUTES
LATER
SHE
HAD
A
FULL
BLOWN
SEIZURES
THIS
WAS
HER
FIRST
EXPOSURE
TO
A
SUGAR
COATED
CEREAL
SINCE
THE
LAST
SEIZURE
MY
DAUGHTER
HAS
EPILEPSY
AND
I
ATTEND
A
MONTHLY
PARENT
SUPPORT
GROUP
JUST
WEDNESDAY
NIGHT
A
MOTHER
WAS
TELLING
HOW
SHE
DECIDED
TO
THROW
ALL
THE
JUNK
FOOD
OUT
AND
SEE
IF
IT
MADE
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
HER
YEAROLDS
SEIZURES
HE
WAS
HAVING
ABOUT
ONE
SEIZURE
PER
WEEK
SHE
REPORTED
THAT
SHE
DID
THIS
ON
THURSDAY
HE
HAD
A
SEIZURE
ON
SATURDAY
AND
THEN
WENT
WEEKS
WITHOUT
A
SEIZURE
ON
EASTER
HE
WENT
TO
GRANDMAS
AND
ATE
CANDY
POP
ANYTHING
HE
WANTED
HE
HAD
A
SEIZURE
THE
NEXT
DAY
SHE
SEES
SENSITIVITY
TO
NUTRASWEET
SUGAR
COLORS
CAFFINE
AND
CORN
WITH
CORN
SHE
SAYS
HE
GETS
VERY
NERVOUS
AND
AGGRESIVE
WITH
MY
OWN
DAUGHTER
AGE
I
THINK
SHE
IS
ALSO
SENSITIVE
AND
STAYS
AWAY
FROM
THOSE
FOODS
ON
HER
OWN
SHE
HAS
NEVER
HAD
GUM
WONT
EAT
CANDY
PREFERS
AN
APPLE
TO
A
COOKIE
DOESNT
LIKE
CHOCOLATE
AND
WONT
EVEN
USE
TOOTHPASTE
HER
BROTHER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
A
JUNK
FOOD
ADDICT
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
GOOD
LUCK
