from

the
complete
homeopathy
handbook
isbn
oringinally
published
in
britain
in
from
page
and
in
when
the
national
health
service
was
established
homeopathy
was
included
as
an
officially
approved
method
of
treatment
i
was
there
in
i
suppose
it
must
have
died
out
since
then
certainly
i
never
heard
of
any
homeopaths
or
herbalists
in
the
employ
of
the
nhs
perhaps
the
law
codified
it
but
the
authorities
refused
to
hire
any
homeopaths
a
similar
law
in
the
us
allows
chiropractors
to
practice
in
va
hospitals
but
ive
never
seen
one
there
and
i
dont
know
of
a
single
va
that
has
hired
a
chiropractor
there
are
a
lot
of
britons
on
the
net
so
someone
should
be
able
to
tell
us
if
the
nhs
provides
homeopaths
for
you
i
dont
think
they
provide
homeopaths
heck
the
heir
apparent
was
trying
to
promote
osteopaths
to
the
ranks
of
eligibility
a
couple
of
years
back
it
pleased
my
family
no
end
since
im
at
an
osteopathic
school
sort
of
validated
it
for
themthen
i
told
them
that
the
name
was
the
same
but
the
practice
was
differentoh
if
youre
seeking
validation
for
your
philosophy
on
the
strength
of
the
national
health
service
adopting
it
i
suggest
that
you
are
not
very
sure
of
the
validity
of
your
philosophy
i
believe
in
the
nhs
was
still
having
its
nurses
taught
the
fine
art
of
cupping
which
is
the
vacuum
extraction
of
intradermal
fluids
by
means
of
heating
a
cup
placing
it
on
the
afflicted
site
and
allowing
it
to
cool
i
wouldnt
take
my
sick
daughter
to
a
homeopath

yikes
im
agreeing
