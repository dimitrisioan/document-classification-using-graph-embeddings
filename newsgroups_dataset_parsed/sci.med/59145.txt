WRITES
MY
DENTIST
WHO
SEES
A
FAIR
AMOUNT
OF
THRUSH
RECOMMENDED
ACIDOPHILOUS
AFTER
I
BEGAN
TAKING
ACIDOPHILOUS
ON
A
DAILY
BASIS
THE
OUTBREAKS
CEASED
WHEN
I
QUIT
TAKING
THE
ACIDOPHILOUS
THE
OUTBREAKS
PERIODICALLY
RESUMED
I
RESUMED
TAKING
THE
ACIDOPHILOUS
WITH
NO
FURTHER
OUTBREAKS
SINCE
THEN
THIS
IS
THE
SECOND
POST
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
BLURRING
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
REAL
DISEASE
CAUSED
BY
CANDIDA
ALBICANS
AND
THE
DISEASE
THAT
WAS
BEING
ASKED
ABOUT
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
CANDIDA
ALBICANS
CAUSES
THRUSH
IT
ALSO
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
CASE
THAT
ACTIVE
YOGURT
CULTURES
WITH
ACIDOPHILOUS
MAY
REDUCE
RECURRENCES
OF
THRUSH
AT
LEAST
FOR
VAGINAL
THRUSH
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
ANYONE
TAKING
IT
FOR
ORAL
THRUSH
BEFORE
THOUGH
PRESUMABLY
IT
WOULD
WORK
BY
THE
SAME
MECHANISM
CANDIDA
IS
CLEARLY
A
COMMON
MINOR
PATHOGEN
AND
A
LESS
COMMON
MAJOR
PATHOGEN
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
THAT
IT
CAUSES
THE
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
