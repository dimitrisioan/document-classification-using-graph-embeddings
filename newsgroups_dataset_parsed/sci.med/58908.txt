frequent
nosebleeds

does
anyone
know
of
any
method
to
reduce
this
frequency
my
younger
brothers
each
tried
a
skin
transplant
thigh
to
nose
lining
but
their
nosebleeds
soon
returned
ive
seen
a
reference
to
an
herb
called
rutin
that
is
supposed
to
help
and
id
like
to
hear
of
experiences
with
it
or
other
techniques
rutin
is
a
bioflavonoid
compounds
found
among
other
places
in
the
rinds
of
citrus
fruits
these
have
been
popular
especially
in
europe
to
treat
capillary
fragility
and
seemingly
in
even
more
extreme
cases
a
few
months
ago
a
friend
was
visiting
from
italy
and
he
said
that
hed
had
hemorrhoids
but
his
pharmacist
friend
sold
him
some
pills
incredulously
i
asked
to
look
at
them
and
sure
enough
these
contained
rutin
as
the
active
ingredient
i
probably
destroyed
the
placebo
effect
from
my
skeptical
sputtering
i
have
no
idea
how
hes
doing
hemorrhoidwise
these
days
the
studies
which
attempted
to
look
at
the
effect
of
these
compounds
in
human
disease
and
nutrition
were
never
very
well
controlled
so
the
reports
of
positive
results
with
them
is
mostly
anecdotal
this
stuff
is
pretty
much
nontoxic
and
probably
inexpensive
so
theres
little
risk
of
trying
it
but
i
wouldnt
expect
much
of
a
result
