cytoskeleton
dynamics
im
looking
for
good
background
and
review
paper
references
that
can
help
me
understand
the
dynamics
of
cytoskeleton
in
normal
and
transformed
cells
in
particular
im
not
interested
in
translational
behavior
and
cell
motility
but
rather
in
the
internal
motions
of
the
cytoskeleton
and
its
components
under
normal
and
transformed
circumstances
also
id
appreciate
any
data
on
force
constants
mechanical
and
elastic
properties
of
microtubules
and
viscous
properties
of
cytoplasm
any
other
info
relevant
to
the
vibrational
or
acoustical
properties
of
these
would
be
useful
to
me
thanks
