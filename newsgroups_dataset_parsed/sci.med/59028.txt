MSG
IS
COMMON
IN
MANY
FOOD
WE
EAT
INCLUDING
CHINESE
THOUGH
SOME
ORIENTAL
RESTAURANTS
MIGHT
PUT
A
TAD
TOO
MUCH
IN
THEM
IVE
NOTICED
THAT
WHEN
I
GO
OUT
AND
EAT
IN
MOST
OF
THE
CHINESE
FOOD
RESTAURANTS
I
WILL
USUALLY
GET
A
SLIGHT
HEADACHE
AND
AN
UNUNSUAL
THIRST
AFTERWARDS
THIS
HAPPENS
TO
MANY
OF
MY
FRIENDS
AND
RELATIVES
TOO
AND
HEH
WE
EAT
CHINESE
FOOD
ALL
THE
TIME
AT
HOME
BUT
WE
DONT
USE
MSG
WHEN
WERE
COOKING
FOR
OURSELVES
SO
WHEN
WE
PUT
ONE
AND
ONE
TOGETHER
IT
CAN
BE
SAFELY
ASSUMED
THAT
MSG
MAY
CAUSE
SOME
ALLERGIC
REACTIONS
IN
SOME
PEOPLE
STICK
WITH
NATURAL
THINGS
MSG
DOESNT
DO
BODY
ANY
GOOD
AND
POSSIBLY
HARMS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
SO
WHY
BOTHER
WITH
IT
TASTE
FOOD
AS
IT
SHOULD
BE
TASTED
AND
DONT
CLOUD
THE
FLAVOR
WITH
AN
IMAGINARY
CLOAK
OF
MSG
