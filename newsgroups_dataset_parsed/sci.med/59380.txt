ALLERGIES
AND
STUFF
WAS
IS
MSG
SENSITIVITY
SUPERSTITION
UNLESS
I
PLAN
ON
GETTING
SICK
I
WONT
EAT
THE
STUFF
WITHOUT
MY
SELDANE
AND
DID
I
EVER
LEARN
TO
READ
LABELS
IT
MIGHT
NOT
PLEASE
A
MEDICAL
RESEARCHER
BUT
IT
PLEASED
MY
OWN
PERSONAL
PHYSICIAN
ENOUGH
FOR
HIM
TO
GIVE
ME
ALLERGY
MEDICINE
ALLERGY
MEDICINE
HUH
IS
THIS
JUST
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
RESULTANT
MIGRAINE
OR
WHATEVER
OR
DOES
IT
ACTUALLY
SUPPRESS
ALLERGIC
REACTIONS
IE
LIKE
AN
ANTIHISTAMINE
DOES
AS
FAR
AS
DOCTORS
OVER
HERE
ARE
CONCERNED
IF
YOU
SLIP
UP
AND
EAT
SOMETHING
YOURE
ALLERGIC
TO
EVEN
IF
THEY
WONT
TEST
YOU
TO
TELL
YOU
WHAT
TO
AVOID
THEN
TOUGH
IF
A
CHEAP
MEDICINE
WILL
ALLEVIATE
YOUR
SYMPTOMS
THEN
FINE
OTHERWISE
YOU
JUST
SUFFER
ONE
DOCTOR
DID
PRESCRIBE
ME
IMIGRAN
COSTS
THE
NHS
FOR
TABLETS
AFTER
HAVING
TO
REHYDRATE
ME
BECAUSE
ID
BEEN
THROWING
UP
FOR
FOUR
SOLID
DAYS
AND
COULDNT
EVEN
DRINK
WATER
BUT
I
GOT
TAKEN
OFF
IT
AGAIN
WHEN
I
MOVED
AND
HAD
TO
CHANGE
DOCTORS
REASONING
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
SIDEEFFECTS
WERE
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
NEW
OK
FINE
BUT
IT
HAS
PASSED
THE
SAFETY
TESTS
TO
GET
ON
THE
PRESCRIPTION
LIST
AND
ANYWAY
I
WAS
PREPARED
TO
TAKE
THE
RISK
TO
HAVE
QUALITY
OF
LIFE
NOW
THE
ONLY
ALTERNATIVES
I
HAVE
IS
TO
GET
IT
PRESCRIBED
PRIVATELY
WHICH
I
CANNOT
AFFORD
OR
TO
PAY
A
PRIVATE
ALLERGY
SPECIALIST
TO
TEST
ME
AND
TELL
ME
WHAT
TO
AVOID
I
AM
FAIRLY
CERTAIN
I
AM
ALLERGIC
TO
MORE
THAN
ONE
CHEMICAL
ADDITIVE
AS
A
LOT
OF
THINGS
I
CANT
EAT
HAVE
NOTHING
IN
COMMON
EXCEPT
THINGS
I
KNOW
ARE
SAFE
SO
TESTING
MYSELF
ISNT
REALLY
AN
OPTION
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
PERMUTATIONS
IM
NOT
SAYING
I
NEVER
CONSUME
ANYTHING
WITH
MSG
IVE
NOTICED
THAT
I
HAVE
A
CERTAIN
TOLERANCE
LEVEL
LIKE
A
SMALL
BAG
OF
BBQ
CHIPS
ONCE
A
MONTH
OR
SO
IT
NOT
A
PROBLEM
BUT
THAT
SAME
BAG
OF
CHIPS
WILL
BOTHER
ME
IF
I
ALSO
HAD
CHICKEN
BOUILLON
YESTERDAY
AND
LUNCH
AT
ONE
OF
THE
CHINESE
RESTAURANTS
THE
DAY
BEFORE
YES
IVE
NOTICED
THAT
AND
I
CAN
WORK
IT
UP
BY
EATING
JUST
UNDER
THE
TOLERANCE
LEVEL
FAIRLY
REGULARLY
IF
I
DONT
EAT
ANYTHING
EXCEPT
HOME
COOKING
FOR
A
MONTH
OR
SO
I
LOSE
IT
AND
HAVE
TO
WORK
IT
UP
FROM
SCRATCH
A
BAD
EXPERIENCE
NOW
I
KNOW
WHAT
THE
EARLYWARNING
SYMPTOMS
ARE
THOUGH
I
CAN
USUALLY
TELL
WHETHER
I
AM
ALLERGIC
TO
FOOD
BEFORE
IVE
EATEN
TOO
MUCH
OF
IT
USUALLY
