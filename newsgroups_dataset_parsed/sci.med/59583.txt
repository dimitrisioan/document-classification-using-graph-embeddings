RE
CATS
AND
PREGNANCY
HELLO
I
HEARD
THAT
A
CERTAIN
DISEASE
TOXOPLASMOSYS
IS
TRANSMITTED
BY
CATS
WHICH
CAN
HARM
THE
UNBORN
FETUS
DOES
ANYBODY
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
IS
IT
A
PROBLEM
TO
HAVE
A
CAT
IN
THE
SAME
APARTMENT
SEE
THE
RECPETSCATS
FAQ
OR
ANY
DOCTOR
OR
VET
FOR
MORE
INFORMATION
I
AM
NOT
ANY
OF
THE
ABOVE
BUT
WE
DO
HAVE
A
COUPLE
OF
CATS
IT
IS
TRANSMITTED
THROUGH
THE
FECAL
MATTER
SO
A
PREGNANT
WOMAN
SHOULD
AVOID
CLEANING
THE
CAT
TRAY
AND
YOU
SHOULD
BOTH
WASH
HANDS
BEFORE
PREPARING
OR
EATING
MEALS
THE
LATTER
IS
SOUND
ADVICE
AT
ANY
TIME
OF
COURSE
APART
FROM
THAT
ITS
NO
GREAT
PROBLEM
YOU
CERTAINLY
DO
NOT
NEED
TO
GET
RID
OF
YOUR
CATS
