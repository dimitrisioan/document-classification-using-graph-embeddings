WRITES
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
OF
A
LONG
SHOT
BUT
WHAT
THE
HELL
THE
NET
IS
FULL
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
STRANGE
KNOWLEDGE
IM
LOOKING
FOR
SUGGESTIONS
AS
TO
WHAT
COULD
BE
CAUSING
HEALTH
PROBLEMS
ONE
OF
MY
RELATIVES
IS
HAVING
ONE
OF
MY
COUSINS
HAS
HAD
HEALTH
PROBLEMS
FOR
MUCH
OF
HER
LIFE
AROUND
THE
AGE
OF
SHE
HAD
SOME
GYNECOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS
NOW
SHES
IN
HER
EARLYMID
TWENTIES
AND
SHE
IS
GOING
BLIND
HER
EYES
ARE
NOT
PRODUCING
ENOUGH
IF
ANY
MOISTURE
SHES
BEEN
GOING
TO
MASS
EYE
AND
EAR
AND
THE
DOCTORS
THERE
HAVE
NO
CLUE
WHAT
THE
ACTUAL
CAUSE
IS
THEY
HAVE
APPARENTLY
TRIED
EYEDROPS
AND
SUCH
SHE
IS
JUST
ABOUT
COMPLETELY
BLIND
IN
ONE
EYE
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
MASSIVELY
DETERIORATED
SJOGRENS
SYNDROME
HAS
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
INDUCE
DRYNESS
IN
VAGINAL
TISSUE
AS
WELL
AS
INDUCE
PRIMARY
BILIARY
CIRRHOSIS
OTHERWISE
THE
ABDOMINAL
SWELLING
COULD
BE
DUE
TO
A
COMPLICATION
OF
SJOGRENS
KNOWN
AS
PSEUDOLYMPHOMA
WHICH
CAN
PRODUCE
A
SPLENOMEGALY
ENLARGED
SPLEEN
SHE
SHOULD
DEFINITELY
SEE
A
RHEUMATOLOGIST
SINCE
YOU
DONT
MENTION
SKIN
DISORDER
ANEMIA
OR
JOINT
PAIN
YOUD
PROBABLY
RULE
OUT
ERYTHEMA
NODOSUM
OR
SCLERODERMA
JOSH
BACKONVMSHUJIACIL
ALSO
AND
THIS
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
RELATED
SHE
IS
HAVING
SOME
CHANGES
IN
HER
ABDOMEN
HER
STOMACH
HAS
SWELLED
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
STOMACH
THE
ORGAN
OR
STOMACH
TEH
AREA
OF
THE
BODY
I
GUESS
THE
STEP
THEYRE
GOING
TO
TAKE
NEXT
IS
TO
DO
A
WHOLE
BATTERY
OF
TESTS
TO
CHECK
ALL
THE
OTHER
INTERNAL
SYSTMES
BESIDES
JUST
THE
EYES
BUT
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
NET
IS
A
SOURCE
OF
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
BIZARRE
KNOWLEDGE
IM
GOING
TO
ASK
HAS
ANYONE
EVER
HEARD
OF
ANYTHING
LIKE
THIS
SUGGESTIONS
OF
THINGS
TO
ASK
ABOUT
SINCE
MUCH
OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
HER
STATE
COMES
SECOND
OR
THIRD
HAND
