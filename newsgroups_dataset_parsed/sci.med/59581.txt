josh
schwimmer
writes
any
opinions
on
burzynskis
antineoplastons
or
information
about
the
current
status
of
his
research
would
be
appreciated
burzynskis
work
is
not
too
promising
none
of
his
through
antineoplastons
have
been
shown
to
have
antineoplastic
effects
against
experimental
cancer
the
nci
conducted
tests
of
and
against
leukemia
in
mice
with
the
result
that
doses
high
enough
to
produce
toxic
effects
in
the
mice
were
not
effective
in
inhibiting
the
growth
of
the
tumor
or
killing
it
these
were
in
and
burzynski
claims
that
is
the
active
factor
common
to
all
of
and
something
which
he
has
not
shown
has
only
been
extracted
from
he
also
hasnt
shown
that
through
are
actually
distinct
substances
the
nci
conducted
a
series
of
tests
using
against
a
standard
panel
of
tumors
that
included
different
cell
lines
from
tumors
in
the
following
classes
leukemia
nonsmallcell
and
smallcell
lung
cancer
colon
cancer
cancer
of
the
central
nervous
system
melanoma
ovarian
cancer
and
renal
cancer
exhibited
neither
growth
inhibition
nor
cytotoxicity
at
the
dose
levels
tested
it
is
necessary
to
process
since
it
is
not
soluble
burzynskis
theory
requires
soluble
agents
but
this
basically
hydrolizes
it
to
pag
which
he
calls
as
pag
is
not
an
information
carrying
peptide
something
which
byrzynski
claims
is
necessary
for
antineoplastic
activity
as
also
derived
from
is
a
mixture
of
pa
and
pag
pa
also
not
a
peptide
can
be
purchased
at
a
chemical
supply
houses
for
about
a
gram
is
chemically
extremely
similar
to
glutithamide
and
thalidomide
both
of
which
are
habit
forming
and
can
cause
peripheral
neuropathy
the
nasty
effects
of
thalidomide
are
widely
known
in
spite
of
this
similarity
does
not
appear
to
have
been
tested
for
its
potential
to
induce
teratogenicity
or
peripheral
neuropathy
many
of
burzynskis
statements
about
the
origin
of
his
theory
early
research
past
and
present
support
by
others
for
his
work
have
been
shown
to
be
untrue
