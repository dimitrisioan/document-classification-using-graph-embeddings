BURZYNSKIS
ANTINEOPLASTONS
OR
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
CURRENT
STATUS
OF
HIS
RESEARCH
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
BURZYNSKIS
WORK
IS
NOT
TOO
PROMISING
NONE
OF
HIS
THROUGH
ANTINEOPLASTONS
HAVE
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
HAVE
ANTINEOPLASTIC
EFFECTS
AGAINST
EXPERIMENTAL
CANCER
THE
NCI
CONDUCTED
TESTS
OF
AND
AGAINST
LEUKEMIA
IN
MICE
WITH
THE
RESULT
THAT
DOSES
HIGH
ENOUGH
TO
PRODUCE
TOXIC
EFFECTS
IN
THE
MICE
WERE
NOT
EFFECTIVE
IN
INHIBITING
THE
GROWTH
OF
THE
TUMOR
OR
KILLING
IT
THESE
WERE
IN
AND
BURZYNSKI
CLAIMS
THAT
IS
THE
ACTIVE
FACTOR
COMMON
TO
ALL
OF
AND
SOMETHING
WHICH
HE
HAS
NOT
SHOWN
HAS
ONLY
BEEN
EXTRACTED

ALSO
HASNT
SHOWN
THAT
THROUGH

ACTUALLY
DISTINCT
SUBSTANCES
THE

A
SERIES
OF

AGAINST
A

DIFFERENT

LEUKEMIA

AT

TESTED
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO

SINCE
IT
IS
NOT

BURZYNSKIS
THEORY
REQUIRES
SOLUBLE
AGENTS
BUT
THIS
BASICALLY
HYDROLIZES
IT
TO
PAG
WHICH

CALLS

NOT
AN

SOMETHING
