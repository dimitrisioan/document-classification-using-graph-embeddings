HERNIA
A
BIT
MORE
THAN
A
YEAR
AGO
A
HERNIA
IN
MY
RIGHT
GROIN
WAS
DISCOVERED
IT
HAD
PRODUCED
A
DULL
PAIN
IN
THAT
AREA
THE
HERNIA
WAS
REPAIRED
USING
THE
LEAST
INTRUSIVE
ORTHOSCOPIC
METHOD
AND
A
PLUG
AND
PATCH
THE
DOCTOR
CONSIDERED
THE
PROCEDURE
A
SUCCESS
A
FEW
MONTHS
LATER
THE
SAME
PAIN
RETURNED
THE
DOCTOR
SAID
THAT
HE
COULD
FIND
NOTHING
WRONG
IN
THE
AREA
OF
THE
HERNIA
REPAIR
NOW
THE
PAIN
OCCURS
MORE
OFTEN
MY
GP
COULDNT
IDENTIFY
ANY
SPECIFIC
PROBLEM
THE
SURGEN
WHO
PERFORMED
THE
ORIGINAL
PROCEDURE
NOW
SAYS
THAT
YES
THERE
IS
A
NEW
HERNIA
IN
THE
SAME
AREA
AND
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
HAS
TO
CUT
INTO
THE
AREA
FOR
THE
REPAIR
THIS
TIME
MY
QUESTION
TO
THE
NET
IS
THERE
A
NONINTRUSIVE
METHOD
TO
DETERMINE
IF
IN
FACT
THERE
IS
A
HERNIA
OR
IF
THE
PAIN
IS
FROM
SOMETHING
ELSE
