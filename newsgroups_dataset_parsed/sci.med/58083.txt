vida
can
one
develop
innerear
problems
from
too
much
flying
i
hear
vida
that
pilots
and
stewardesses
have
a
limit
as
to
the
maximum
vida
number
of
flying
hours
what
are
these
limits
what
are
the
vida
main
problems
associated
with
too
many
longhaul
over
hours
vida
trips
the
crew
rest
requirements
are
to
prevent
undue
fatigue
the
cockpit
crew
pilot
limits
are
somewhat
more
stringent
than
the
cabin
crew
limits
for
this
reason
crew
rest
requirements
address
amount
of
time
on
duty
plus
rest
time
a
tired
crew
is
an
accidentprone
crew
the
only
limits
i
know
of
for
innerear
problems
are
in
military
aircraft
which
are
frequently
unpressurized
or
less
reliably
pressurized
not
being
able
to
clear
the
ears
renders
aircrew
members
dnif
duties
not
involving
flying
or
grounded
until
the
ears
clear
flying
can
accentuate
problems
if
ears
dont
clear
if
you
dont
have
big
pressure
changes
you
may
not
know
that
youve
got
a
problem
but
if
you
zip
up
to
or
ft
the
usual
cabin
altitude
in
an
airliner
and
then
back
down
to
sea
level
you
may
discover
a
problem
ears
dont
clear
readily
because
of
allergies
colds
infections
and
anatomical
problems
the
last
wont
change
the
first
three
can
medication
decongestants
or
antihistimines
usually
can
help
chewing

sucking
