a
student
told
me
today
that
she
has
been
diagnosed
with
kidney
stones
a
cyst
on
one
kidney
and
a
kidney
infection
she
was
upset
because
her
condition
had
been
misdiagnosed
since
last
fall
and
she
has
been
ill
all
this
time
during
her
most
recent
doctors
appointment
at
her
parents
hmo
clinic
she
said
that
about
forty
xrays
were
made
of
her
kidney
when
she
asked
why
so
many
xrays
were
being
made
she
was
told
by
a
technician
that
they
need
to
see
the
area
from
different
views
but
she
says
that
about
five
xrays
were
made
from
each
angle
she
couldnt
help
feeling
that
something
must
be
wrong
with
the
procedure
or
something
she
is
a
premed
student
and
feels
she
could
have
understood
what
was
happening
if
someone
would
have
explained
when
nobody
would
she
got
worried
also
she
is
told
that
thre
are
surgery
patients
ahead
of
her
and
that
they
cannot
do
surgery
until
august
or
so
it
is
now
april
she
is
supposed
to
rest
a
lot
and
drink
fluids
but
she
has
to
go
to
classes
she
wonders
why
they
have
given
her
no
medicine
she
plans
to
call
back
her
doctors
office
clinic
and
try
to
get
answers
to
these
questions
but
i
told
her
i
would
also
write
in
to
scimed
and
see
what
i
could
find
out
about
why
there
were
so
many
xrays
and
whether
it
seems
ok
to
wait
in
line
or
more
months
for
surgery
for
something
like
this
or
whether
she
should
be
looking
elsewhere
for
her
care
she
does
plan
to
get
a
second
opinion
too
i
will
pass
info
on
to
her
it
never
hurts
to
get
information
from
more
than
one
source
you
can
email
me
or
post
thanks
alice
my
opinionfor
what
its
worth
is
that
xrays
is
way
too
many
guidleines
have
been
set
on
the
number
of
dental
xrays
and
chest
xrays
that
one
should
have
over
a
given
period
of
time
because
of
all
the
environmental
factors
that
can
cause
cancer
in
humans
ionizing
radiation
is
one
of
the
most
potentsplits
dna
and
causes
hydroxyl
free
radical
formation
in
tissue
cells
ultasoundlike
that
used
in
seeing
the
fetus
in
the
uterus
has
been
shown
to
be
extremely
good
at
picking
up
tumors
in
the
prostate
and
gallstones
in
the
gallbladder
but
kidney
tissue
may
be
too
dense
for
ultrasound
to
work
for
kidney
stonesany
radiologists
care
to
comment
most
stones
will
passbut
its
a
very
painful
process
unlike
gallstones
i
dont
think
that
there
are
many
drugs
that
can
help
dissolve
the
kidney
stonewhich
is
probably
calciumoxalate
vitamin
c
and
magnesium
have
worked
in
rabbits
to
remove
calcium
from
calcified
plaques
in
the
aterial
wall
i
have
no
idea
if
a
diet
change
or
supplementation
could
speed
up
the
process
of
kidney
stone
passagebut
im
pretty
confident
that
a
diet
change
andor
supplementation
can
prevent
a
reoccurance
if
surgery
is
being
contemplated
the
stone
must
be
in
the
kidney
tubule
a
second
opinion
is
a
good
idea
because
there
are
betterless
damaging
ways
to
break
up
the
stone
if
its
logged
within
the
kidneysonic
blasts
hmos
are
notorious
for
conservative
care
and
long
waits
for
expensvie
treatments
my
condolences
to
your
friend
