LAST
WEEK
I
WENT
TO
SEE
A
GASTROENTEROLOGIST
I
HAD
NEVER
MET
THIS
DOCTOR
BEFORE
AND
SHE
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
I
WAS
THERE
FOR
AS
SOON
AS
I
ARRIVED
SOMEBODY
SHOWED
ME
TO
AN
EXAMINING
ROOM
AND
HANDED
ME
A
GOWN
THEY
TOLD
ME
TO
UNDRESS
FROM
THE
WAIST
DOWN
TO
BE
EXACT
AND
WAIT
FOR
THE
DOCTOR
IS
THIS
THE
USUAL
DRILL
WHEN
YOU
GO
TO
A
DOCTOR
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
EXPERIENCE
GOING
TO
DOCTORS
KNOCK
ON
WOOD
BUT
ON
THE
COUPLE
OF
OCCASIONS
WHEN
IVE
GONE
TO
A
NEW
DOCTOR
I
MET
HIM
WITH
MY
CLOTHES
ON
FIRST
HE
INTRODUCED
HIMSELF
ASKED
WHAT
I
WAS
THERE
FOR
AND
TOOK
A
HISTORY
ALL
BEFORE
I
UNDRESSED
ARE
PATIENTS
USUALLY
EXPECTED
TO
GET
NAKED
BEFORE
MEETING
A
DOCTOR
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
PERSONALLY
ID
PREFER
TO
MEET
THE
DOCTOR
ON
SOMETHING
REMOTELY
RESEMBLING
A
CONDITION
OF
PARITY
AND
TO
ESTABLISH
AN
IDENTITY
AS
A
PERSON
WHO
WEARS
CLOTHES
BEFORE
DROPPING
MY
DRAWERS
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
IT
MINIMIZES
THE
TIME
THAT
I
HAVE
TO
SPEND
IN
THE
SELF
CONSCIOUS
ILL
AT
EASE
AND
VULNERABLE
CONDITION
OF
A
PERSON
WITH
A
BARE
BOTTOM
TALKING
TO
SOMEBODY
WHO
IS
FULLY
CLOTHED
DOES
ANYBODY
BESIDES
ME
REGARD
THIS
