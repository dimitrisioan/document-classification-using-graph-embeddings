dont
think
extrascientific
is
a
very
useful
phrase
in
a
discussion
of
the
boundaries
of
science
except
as
a
proposed
definiens
extrarational
is
a
better
phrase
in
fact
there
are
quite
a
number
of
wellknown
cases
of
extrarational
considerations
driving
science
in
a
useful
direction
yeah
but
the
problem
with
holding
up
the
extrarational
examples
as
exemplars
or
as
refutations
of
well
founded
methodology
is
that
you
run
smack
up
against
such
unuseful
directions
as
lysenko
such
extra
rational
cases
are
curiosities
not
guides
to
methodology
