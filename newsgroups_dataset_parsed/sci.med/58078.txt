HI

I
HAVE
A
VERY
OILY
SKIN
MY
PROBLEM
IS
WHEN

WASH
MY

IT
BECOMES
OILY
IN
HALF
AN
HOUR
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
NOSE
REGION
IS
THIS
AN
ILLNESS
HOW
CAN
I
PREVENT
IT
FROM
OCCURING
IN
SUCH
SHORT
TIME
IS
THERE
A
CLEANSER
OUT
THERE
THAT
WILL
DO
A
BETTER
JOB
THAT
IS
AFTER
CLEANING
MY
FACE
WONT
BECOME
OILY
IN
SUCH
A
SHORT
TIME
THANK
YOU
FOR
ANY
SUGGESTION
IF
THIS
IS
A
DISEASE
EVERYONE

HAVE
IT
MY
SKIN
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
OILY
I
USED
TO
SAY
IF
I
WERE
HOT
ENOUGH
YOU
COULD
FRY
AN
EGG
ON
MY
OILY
FACE
I
AM
NOW
YRS
OLD
AND
MY
SKIN
LOOKS
YOUNGER
IM
TOLD

SOME
PEOPLES
SKIN
AT
ITS
STILL
OILY

HAVE
ONLY
A
VERY
FEW
TINY
WRINKLES
