JOHN
SETEL
ODONNELL
WRITES
IMHO
YOU
HAVE
LYME
DISEASE
I
TOLD
YOU
THIS
IN
PRIVATE
EMAIL
AND
PREDICTED
THAT
YOU
MIGHT
NEXT
START
HAVING
THE
MIGRATING
PAINS
AND
FURTHER
JOINT
IMHO
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
HAS
NO
BUSINESS
SOLICITING
DIAGNOSES
OFF
THE
NET
NOR
DOES
DRMR
ODONNELL
HAVE
ANY
BUSINESS
SUPPLYING
SAME
THIS
IS
ONE
MAJOR
REASON
REAL
PHYSICIANS
AVOID
THIS
NEWSGROUP
LIKE
THE
PLAGUE
IT
IS
ALSO
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
DOUBLE
STANDARD
IF
I
AS
A
PHYSICIAN
OFFERED
TO
DIAGNOSE
AND
TREAT
ON
THE
NET
I
CAN
BE
SUED
BUT
PEOPLE
WITHOUT
QUALIFICATIONS
ARE
FREE
TO
DO
WHATEVER
THEY
WANT
AND
DISCLAIM
IT
ALL
WITH
IM
NOT
A
DOCTOR
GET
AND
KEEP
THIS
CRAP
OFF
THE
NET
PERIOD
