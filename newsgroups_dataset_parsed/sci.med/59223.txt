FROZEN
SHOULDER
AND
LAWN
MOWING
IHAVE
HAD
A
FROZEN
SHOULDER
FOR
OVER
A
YEAR
OR
ABOUT
A
YEAR
IT
IS
STILL
PARTIALLY
FROZEN
AND
I
AM
STILL
IN
PHYSICAL
THERAPY
EVERY
WEEK
BUT
THE
PAIN
HAS
SUBSIDED
ALMOST
COMPLETELY
UNTIL
LAST
WEEK
WHEN
I
MOWED
THE
LAWN
FOR
TWENTY
MINUTES
EACH
TWO
DAYS
IN
A
ROW
I
HAVE
A
PUSH
TYPE
POWER
MOWER
THE
PAIN
STARTED
BACK
UP
A
LITTLE
BIT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
QUITE
A
WHILE
AND
I
USED
ICE
AND
MEDICINE
AGAIN
CAN
ANYBODY
EXPLAIN
WHY
THIS
PARTICULAR
ACTIVITY
WHICH
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
STRESS
ME
VERY
MUCH
GENERALLY
SHOULD
CAUSE
THIS
SHOULDER
PROBLEM
THANKS
ALICE
