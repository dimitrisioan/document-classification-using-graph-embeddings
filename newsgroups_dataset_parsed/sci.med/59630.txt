ATHLETES
HEART
IVE
READ
THAT
EXERCISE
MAKES
THE
HEART
PUMP
MORE
BLOOD
AT
A
STROKE
AND
THAT
IT
ALSO
MAKES
THE
HEART
PUMB
SLOWER
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
UP
FOR
THE
GREATER
VOLUME
MY
INTERNIST
WHO
DIAGNOSED
MY
AV
BLOCK
SLOW
HEART
RATE
AND
PVCS
TOLD
ME
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
SHE
SAYS
THAT
HEART
RATE
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
ELECTRICAL
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
HEAR
MUSCLE
NOT
ITS
SIZE
EXERCISE
LOWERS
HEART
RATE
AND
INCREASES
STROKE
VOLUME
BUT
THE
EFFECTS
ARE
UNRELATED
EXCEPT
FOR
THEIR
COMMON
SOURCE
THE
AV
BLOCK
SHE
ASSERTS
IS
ANOTHER
ELECTRICAL
EFFECT
WHICH
IS
IRREVERSABLE
EVEN
WHEN
EXERCISE
IS
DICONTINUED
PVCS
ARE
ALSO
COMMON
IN
RUNNERS
SO
MY
EKG
PUTS
ME
IN
A
CLASS
WITH
TRAINED
ATHLETES
AND
ALSO
WITH
HEART
PATIENTS
ISNT
THAT
STRANGE
THOUGH
ARE
THERE
ANY
NOTSOBENEFICIAL
ASPECTS
TO
ATHLETES
HEART
IS
IT
ALL
GOOD
NOT
WORRIED
JUST
CURIOUS
