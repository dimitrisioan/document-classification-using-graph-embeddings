WHAT
IS
WRONG
WITH
THE
ABOVE
OBSERVATION
IS
THAT
IT
EXPLICITLY
GIVES
THE
IMPRESSION
AND
YOU
MAY
NOT
IN
FACT
HOLD
THIS
VIEW
THAT
THE
COMMON
PERHAPS
EVEN
THE
CORRECT
APPROACH
FOR
A
SCIENTIST
TO
FOLLOW
IS
TO
SIT
AROUND
HAVING
FLIGHTS
OF
FANCY
AND
SCHEMING
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
HIS
JEALOUSIES
AND
PETTY
HATREDS
FLIGHTS
OF
FANCY
AND
OTHER
IRRATIONAL
APPROACHES
ARE
COMMON
THE
CRUCIAL
THING
IS
NOT
TO
SIT
AROUND
JUST
HAVING
FANTASIES
THEY
ARENT
OF
ANY
USE
UNLESS
THEY
MAKE
YOU
DO
SOME
EXPERIMENTS
IVE
KNOWN
A
LOT
OF
SCIENTISTS
WHOSE
FANTASIES
LEAD
THEM
ON
TO
CREATIVE
WORK
USUALLY
THEY
WONT
ADMIT
OUT
LOUD
WHAT
THE
FANTASY
WAS
PRIOR
TO
THE
CONSUMPTION
OF
A
FEW
BEERS
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
WARREN
JELINEK
NOTICED
AN
EXTREMELY
HEAVY
BAND
ON
A
DNA
ELECTROPHORESIS
GEL
OF
HUMAN
ALU
FRAGMENTS
HE
GOT
VERY
EXCITED
HOPING
THAT
HED
SEEN
SOME
ESSENTIAL
PART
OF
THE
CONTROL
MECHANISM
FOR
EUKARYOTIC
GENES
THIS
FANTASY
LED
HIM
TO
SEQUENCE
SAMPLES
OF
THE
BAND
AND
CARRY
OUT
BINDING
ASSAYS
THE
RESULT
WAS
A
WELLCONSERVED
OR
SO
BP
SEQUENCE
THAT
OCCURS
ABOUT
TIMES
IN
THE
HUMAN
GENOME
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR
WARRENS
FANTASY
IT
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
A
TRANSPOSON
THAT
IS
PRESENT
IN
SO
MANY
COPIES
BECAUSE
IT
REPLICATES
ITSELF
AND
COPIES
ITSELF
BACK
INTO
THE
GENOME
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
TRANSPOSONS
WERE
MUCH
ELUCIDATED
THE
NECESSITY
OF
A
CELLULAR
REVERSE
TRANSCRIPTASE
WAS
RECOGNIZED
AND
THE
STANDARD
METHOD
OF
RECOGNIZING
HUMAN
DNA
WAS
CREATED
OTHER
SPECIES
HAVE
DIFFERENT
SETS
OF
TRANSPOSONS
FORTUNATELY
FOR
ME
WARREN
AND
I
USED
TO
EAT
DINNER
AT
TGI
FRIDAYS
ALL
THE
TIME
IT
FURTHER
AT
LEAST
IMPLICITLY
ADVANCES
THE
POSITION
THAT
SCIENCES
GOES
FORWARD
AND
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
GIVEN
THE
CONTEXT
IN
WHICH
IT
OCCURS
BY
GENERATING
IN
A
COMPLETELY
NONRATIONAL
AND
EVEN
RANDOM
WAY
A
PLETHORA
OF
HYPOTHESES
AND
THEORIES
THAT
ARE
THEN
WEEDED
OUT
VIA
THE
CRITICAL
FUNCTION
OF
SCIENCE
IM
NOT
SURE
THAT
ITS
RANDOM
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
KNOWN
RATIONAL
MECHANISM
FOR
GENERATING
A
RICH
SET
OF
INTERESTING
HYPOTHESES
IF
YOU
ARE
REALLY
WORKING
IN
AN
UNKNOWN
AREA
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
YOU
WILL
HAVE
MUCH
SENSE
OF
WHAT
MIGHT
OR
MIGHT
NOT
BE
TRUE
UNDER
THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES
THE
BEST
THING
TO
DO
IS
JUST
FOLLOW
WHATEVER
INSTINCTS
YOU
HAVE
IF
THEY
ARE
WRONG
YOU
WILL
FIND
OUT
SOON
ENOUGH
BUT
AT
LEAST
YOU
WILL
FIND
OUT
SOMETHING
IF
YOU
TRY
TO
DO
EXPERIMENTS
AT
RANDOM
WITH
NO
PRIOR
CONCEPTIONS
AT
ALL
IN
MIND
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
GET
NOWHERE
THOUGH
WHY
THIS
CRITICAL
FUNCTION
SHOULD
BE
LESS
SUBJECT
TO
THE
NONRATIONAL
FORCES
IS
A
MYSTERY
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
CRITICAL
FUNCTION
DOES
SOMETIMES
BECOME
HOSTAGE
TO
NONRATIONAL
FORCES
THEN
WE
GET
VARIETIES
OF
PATHOLOGICAL
SCIENCE
LYSENKO
MIRSKYS
OPPOSITION
TO
DNAASGENE
COLD
FUSION
AND
SO
FORTH
IF
EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
HYPOTHESES
CREATION
AND
THEORY
CONSTRUCTION
ARE
SUBJECT
TO
JEALOUSIES
AND
PETTY
HATREDS
THEN
THIS
MUST
BE
EQUALLY
TRUE
OF
THE
APPLICATION
OF
ANY
CRITICAL
FUNCTION
CONCERNING
REPLICATION
THIS
IS
WHAT
LEADS
ONE
ALA
FEYERABEND
TO
AN
ANYTHING
GOES
VIEW
I
DONT
AGREE
THAT
THIS
FOLLOWS
IN
FACT
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
THE
POINT
AT
WHICH
I
DISAGREE
WITH
FEYERABEND
IT
IS
A
MOST
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THE
CULTURE
OF
SCIENCE
THAT
ONE
KEEPS
ONES
JEALOUSIES
OUT
OF
THE
REFEREEING
PROCESS
FAILURES
THERE
ARE
APLENTY
BUT
ON
THE
WHOLE
THINGS
WORK
OUT
ANOTHER
POINT
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
SENSES
OF
THE
PHRASE
EXPERIMENTAL
DESIGN
ID
SAY
THAT
THE
LESS
RATIONAL
PART
IS
IN
EXPERIMENTAL
CHOICE
NOT
DESIGN
ALEXANDER

ROYAL

CHOSE

FOR

IN
HIS

FOR
STRANGE

IN

PROBABLY

NOSE
WHAT
THE

ITS
WORTH

HIS
METHOD
OF
LOOKING
FOR
PHAGE
WAS
WELLDESIGNED
TO
DETECT
ANYTHING
PHAGELIKE
IN
FACT
HE
FOUND
LYSOZYME
TRUE
THE
GENERATION
PART
CAN
BE
TOTALLY
IRRATIONAL
BUT
TYPICALLY
IT
IS
NOT
ANECDOTES
CONCERNING
INSTANCES
WHERE
A
HYPOTHESIS
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
RESULTED
IN
SOME
WAY
FROM
A
DREAM
OR
FROM
ONES
POLITICAL
VIEWS
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
GENERALIZE
WELL
TO
THE
ACTUAL
HISTORY
OF
SCIENCE
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
TO
ME
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
RATIONAL
VS
IRRATIONAL
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
GIVE
A
FEW
EXAMPLES
OF
SURPRISING
EXPERIMENTS
THAT
WERE
TRIED
OUT
FOR
PERFECTLY
RATIONAL
REASONS
OR
INTERESTING
NEW
THEORIES
THAT
WERE
FIRST
ADVANCED
FROM
LOGICAL
GROUNDS
THE
MAIN
EXAMPLES
I
CAN
THINK
OF
ARE
FROM
MODERN
HIGHENERGY
PHYSICS
WHICH
IS
NOT
TYPICAL
OF
