IMMUNOTHERAPY
FOR
RECURRENT
MISCARRIAGE
FOLLOWING
A
SERIES
OF
MISCARRIAGES
MY
WIFE
WAS
GIVEN
A
TRANSFUSION
OF
MY
WHITE
CELLS
THE
THEORY
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
IMMUNE
BLOCKING
THAT
PREVENTS
THE
BODY
FROM
ATTACKING
THE
PREGNANCY
AS
IT
NORMALLY
WOULD
A
FOREIGN
BODY
WHERE
THIS
BLOCKING
IS
DEFICIENT
THE
BODY
EVICTS
THE
INTRUDER
RESULTING
IN
A
MISCARRIAGE
THE
WHITE
CELLS
APPARENTLY
ENHANCE
THE
BLOCKING
CAPABILITY
FOLLOWING
THE
TRANSFUSION
SHE
SUCCESSFULLY
CARRIED
THE
NEXT
PREGNANCY
TO
TERM
AND
JAKE
IS
NOW
AN
ACTIVE
MONTHOLD
WHO
CANNOT
WAIT
TO
WALK
WERE
NOW
THINKING
ABOUT
HAVING
ANOTHER
CHILD
BUT
NO
ONE
INCLUDING
THE
OBGYN
WHO
SUPERVISED
THE
FIRST
TRANSFUSION
REALLY
SEEMS
TO
KNOW
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
TRANSFUSION
PROCESS
NEEDS
TO
BE
REPEATED
FOR
SUCCESSIVE
PREGNANCIES
IS
THERE
ANYONE
IN
NETLAND
WHO
HAS
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THIS
THANKSGENE
AND
JANE
AND
JAKE
