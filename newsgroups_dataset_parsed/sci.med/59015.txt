STEVE
HEFFNER
WRITES
A
BIT
MORE
THAN
A
YEAR
AGO
A
HERNIA
IN
MY
RIGHT
GROIN
WAS
DISCOVERED
IT
HAD
PRODUCED
A
DULL
PAIN
IN
THAT
AREA
THE
HERNIA
WAS
REPAIRED
USING
THE
LEAST
INTRUSIVE
ORTHOSCOPIC
METHOD
AND
A
PLUG
AND
PATCH
I
SUSPECT
YOU
MEAN
LAPAROSCOPIC
INSTEAD
OF
ORTHOSCOPIC
NOW
THE
PAIN
OCCURS
MORE
OFTEN
MY
GP
COULDNT
IDENTIFY
ANY
SPECIFIC
PROBLEM
THE
SURGEN
WHO
PERFORMED
THE
ORIGINAL
PROCEDURE
NOW
SAYS
THAT
YES
THERE
IS
A
NEW
HERNIA
IN
THE
SAME
AREA
AND
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
HAS
TO
CUT
INTO
THE
AREA
FOR
THE
REPAIR
THIS
TIME
MY
QUESTION
TO
THE
NET
IS
THERE
A
NONINTRUSIVE
METHOD
TO
DETERMINE
IF
IN
FACT
THERE
IS
A
HERNIA
OR
IF
THE
PAIN
IS
FROM
SOMETHING
ELSE
BY
FAR
THE
STILL
BEST
METHOD
TO
DIAGNOSE
A
HERNIA
IS
OLD
FASHIONED
PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
OBVIOUS
HERNIA
SAC
COMING
DOWN
INTO
YOUR
SCROTUM
OR
A
BULGE
IN
YOUR
GROIN
THAT
IS
BROUGHT
ABOUT
BY
INCREASING
INTRAABDOMINAL
PRESSURE
SOMETIMES
IS
NOT
THAT
OBVIOUS
THE
HERNIA
IS
SMALL
AND
YOU
CAN
ONLY
DETECT
IT
BY
PUTTING
YOUR
FINGER
INTO
THE
INGUINAL
CANAL
WHETHER
YOU
HAVE
A
RECURRENT
HERNIA
OR
THIS
IS
RELATED
TO
THE
PREVIOUS
OPERATION
I
CANT
TELL
YOU
THE
PERSON
THAT
EXAMINED
YOU
IS
IN
THE
BEST
POSITION
TO
MAKE
THAT
DETERMINATION
ARE
THERE
NONINVASIVE
WAYS
OF
DIAGNOSING
A
HERNIA
EVERY
NOW
AND
THEN
FOLKS
WRITE
ABOUT
CT
SCANS
AND
ULTRASOUNDS
FOR
THIS
BUT
THESE
ARE
FAR
TOO
EXPENSIVE
AND
UNLIKELY
TO
BE
BETTER
THAN
A
TRAINED
EXAMINING
