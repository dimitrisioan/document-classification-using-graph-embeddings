is
common
in
many
food
we
eat
including
chinese
though
some
oriental
restaurants
might
put
a
tad
too
much
in
them
ive
noticed
that
when
i
go
out
and
eat
in
most
of
the
chinese
food
restaurants
i
will
usually
get
a
slight
headache
and
an
ununsual
thirst
afterwards
this
happens
to
many
of
my
friends
and
relatives
too
and
heh
we
eat
chinese
food
all
the
time
at
home
but
we
dont
use
msg
when
were
cooking
for
ourselves
heck
i
seem
to
feel
like
that
every
time
i
eat
out
including
in
the
cafeteria
at
work
about
half
the
time
the
headache
intensifies
until
nothing
will
make
it
go
away
except
throwing
up
ick
as
you
might
imagine
i
dont
eat
out
a
lot
i
guess
my
tolerance
for
food
additives
has
plummeted
since
i
switched
to
eating
mostly
steamed
veggies
theyre
easy
to
fix
thats
all
i
wont
even
mention
what
happened
the
last
time
i
ate
corned
beef
oops
too
late
the

bbs
its
