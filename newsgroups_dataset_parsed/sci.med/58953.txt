critique
of
pressure
point
massager
as
promised
below
is
a
personal
critique
of
a
pressure
point
massager
i
recently
bought
from
the
self
care
catalog
i
am
very
pleased
with
the
results
the
catalog
description
is
as
follows
the
pressure
point
massager
is
an
aggressive
physical
massager
that
actually
kneads
the
tension
out
of
muscles
much
like
a
professional
shiatsu
masseur
the
powerful
motor
drives
two
counterrotating
thumbs
that
move
in
oneinch
orbits
releasing
tension
in
the
neck
back
legs
and
arms
pressure
point
massager
to
order
or
receive
a
catalog
call
hours
days
or
fax
at
note
when
i
ordered
the
massager
the
item
number
was
different
and
the
price
was
not
when
i
received
it
i
glanced
thru
the
newer
catalog
enclosed
with
it
to
see
anything
was
different
from
the
first
one
i
was
quite
annoyed
to
see
a
difference
in
price
i
called
them
about
it
and
the
cust
rep
said
that
they
had
switched
manufacturers
although
it
looks
and
works
exactly
the
same
he
told
me
to
go
ahead
and
return
the
first
one
and
order
the
cheaper
one
using
the
price
difference
as
a
reason
for
return
in
fact
since
the
newer
ones
might
take
a
while
to
ship
from
the
factory
i
received
this
one
in
days
he
told
me
i
could
use
the
one
i
already
have
until
the
new
one
arrives
then
return
the
old
one
very
reasonable
people
i
have
longterm
neck
shoulder
and
back
pain
if
i
were
a
building
i
would
be
described
as
structurally
unsound
i
have
stretches
and
exercises
to
do
that
help
but
the
problem
never
really
goes
away
if
for
whatever
reason
i
do
not
exercise
for
a
while
illness
not
enough
time
lazy
etc
the
muscles
become
quite
stiff
and
painful
and
thus
more
prone
to
further
strain
even
with
exercise
i
sometimes
require
physical
therapy
to
get
back
on
track
which
requires
a
doctor
visit
to
get
the
prescription
for
pt
the
tension
in
my
neck
if
not
released
eventually
causes
a
headache
sometimes
confused
with
a
sinus
headache
over
my
left
eye
when
my
physical
therapist
has
massaged
my
neck
and
the
suboccipital
muscles
in
particular
the
knobby
areas
near
the
base
of
the
skull
the
headache
usually
eased
within
a
day
although
it
hurts
like
hell
to
while
it
is
being
massaged
i
ordered
this
device
because
it
seemed
to
be
exactly
what
i
was
wishing
someone
would
invent
a
machine
that
would
massage
not
vibrate
my
neck
and
suboccipital
muscles
like
my
physical
therapist
has
done
in
the
past
that
i
could
use
by
myself
no
doctor
visit
or
inconvenient
pt
appts
for
a
week
later
would
be
needed
to
use
it
i
could
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
use
it
if
necessary
i
have
been
using
it
for
about
a
week
or
so
now
and
love
it
the
base
unit
is
about
a
x
rectangle
about
high
with
handles
on
each
side
and
it
plugs
into
an
average
outlet
the
two
metal
thumbs
are
about
in
diameter
and
protrude
about
above
the
base
the
thumbs
are
covered
with
a
gray
cloth
that
is
nonremovable
they
are
located
more
toward
one
end
rather
than
centered
see
figure
below
they
move
in
either
clockwise
or
counterclockwise
directions
depending
on
which
side
of
the
switch
is
pushed
and
are
very
quiet
it
can
be
used
from
either
side
for
instance
the
thumbs
can
be
positioned
at
the
base
of
the
neck
or
the
top
of
the
neck
depending
on
which
direction
you
approach
it
for
the
neckhead
the
user
varies
the
amount
of
pressure
used
by
if
laying
down
allowing
all
or
part
of
the
full
weight
of
the
head
andor
neck
to
rest
on
the
thumbs
the
handles
can
also
be
used
if
sitting
or
standing
applying
pressure
with
the
armswrists
since
my
wrists
are
also
impaired
im
typing
this
over
an
extended
period
of
time
and
i
dont
have
someone
living
with
me
who
can
apply
it
laying
down
works
well
for
me
for
my
back
i
sit
in
a
highbacked
kitchen
chair
position
the
massager
behind
me
at
whatever
point
i
want
massaged
and
lean
back
lightly
or
not
so
lightly
against
it
the
pressure
of
leaning
back
holds
it
in
place
if
i
want
to
massage
the
entire
spine
i
simply
move
it
down
a
few
inches
whenever
i
feel
like
it
for
my
back
this
machine
is
far
superior
to
use
than
the
commonly
used
homemade
massager
of
tennis
balls
taped
together
with
the
balls
position
against
a
wall
or
door
them
over
the
spine
and
move
the
body
up
and
down
against
them
the
tennis
balls
are
better
than
nothing
but
difficult
to
use
for
very
long
especially
if
your
quads
are
not
in
good
shape
and
my
long
hair
gets
painfully
in
the
way
if
i
dont
pin
it
up
first
as
far
as
im
concerned
the
easier
something
like
this
is
to
use
the
more
likely
ill
usedo
it
if
there
are
multiple
considerationshassles
im
more
likely
to
not
bother
with
it
not
only
has
this
machine
helped
with
my
headaches
but
my
range
of
motion
for
my
neck
and
back
are
greatly
increased
the
first
time
i
used
it
on
my
necksuboccipital
muscles
however
i
overdid
it
and
pressed
too
hard
against
it
which
resulted
in
a
very
tender
almost
bruised
area
for
a
few
days
i
laid
off
it
for
about
days
and
applied
ice
which
helped
after
that
i
was
more
gradual
about
applying
pressure
at
this
point
the
pain
in
the
suboccipital
area
is
now
minimal
while
being
massaged
i
also
learned
to
use
very
light
pressure
on
my
lower
back
which
is
the
most
vulnerable
point
for
me
it
also
eased
some
painful
knots
of
tension
between
my
shoulder
blades
although
again
it
took
a
few
days
of
massaging
just
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
to
really
work
it
out
i
highly
recommend
this
product
if
you
have
similar
problems
although
i
cannot
vouch
for
its
durability
it
seems
pretty
sturdy
since
ive
had
it
such
a
short
time
i
plan
to
use
it
not
only
to
ease
tension
but
also
to
loosen
the
muscls
before
exercising
and
maybe
after
too
i
have
been
ill
recently
and
not
able
to
exercise
much
for
a
few
weeks
so
this
was
very
timely
for
me
this
is
the
product
ive
ordered
from
this
company
and
only
recently
became
aware
of
it
thru
a
coworker
the
catalog
states
they
have
been
in
business
since
it
contains
quite
a
few
health
care
products
and
while
they
appear
to
be
more
expensive
than
the
average
health
care
catalog
products
they
also
appear
to
be
of
much
higher
quality
with
more
thought
put
into
what
they
actually
do
definitely
a
step
above
some
other
ones
ive
seen
such
as
dr
leonards
health
care
catalog
or
mature
wisdom
im
only
but
have
ended
up
on
some
geriatrictype
mailing
lists
no
big
surprise
here
i
consider
many
of
those
products
to
be
ripoffs
particularly
targeted
toward
the
elderly
with
dubious
health
benefits
i
apologize
for
the
length
of
this
but
its
the
kind
of
info
i
would
like
to
know
before
ordering
something
thru
the
mail
