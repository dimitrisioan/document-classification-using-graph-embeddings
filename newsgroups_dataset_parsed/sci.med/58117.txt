i
was
wondering
what
steps
are
being
taken
to
prevent
the
spread
of
multidrug
resistant
tuberculosis
ive
heard
that
some
places
are
thinking
of
incarcerating
those
with
the
disease
doesnt
this
violate
the
civil
rights
of
these
individuals
are
there
any
legal
precedents
for
such
action
who
knows
in
this
legal
climate
but
there
is
tremendous
legal
precendent
for
forcibly
quarantining
tb
patients
in
sanitariums
yrs
ago
it
was
done
all
the
time
it
has
been
done
sporadically
all
along
in
patients
who
wont
take
their
medicine
if
you
have
tb
you
may
find
yourself
under
surveilence
of
the
public
health
department
and
you
may
find
they
have
the
legal
power
to
insist
you
make
your
clinic
visits
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
gebcadredslpittedu
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
