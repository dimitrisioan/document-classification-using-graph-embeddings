WRITES
I
LOVE
THE
FAQ
THE
COMMENT
ABOUT
CONTACT
LENSES
NOT
BEING
AN
OPTION
FOR
ANY
REMAINING
CORRECTION
AFTER
RK
AND
POSSIBLY
AFTER
PRK
IS
INTERRESTING
WHY
IS
THIS
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
FOR
SURE
WHETHER
THIS
APPLIES
TO
PRK
AS
WELL
IVE
HAD
PRK
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
ASKING
A
DOCTOR
ABOUT
CONTACTS
MINE
SAID
YES
TO
CONTACTS
I
THINK
THE
SCARS
FROM
RK
WOULD
PRECLUDE
CONTACTS
ALSO
WHY
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
GET
A
CORRECTION
IN
PRK
WITH
INVOLVEMENT
OF
ONLY
ABOUT
OF
THE
CORNEAL
DEPTH
WHILE
RK
IS
DONE
TO
A
DEPTH
OF
UP
TO
WHY
SUCH
A
DIFFERENCE
I
THOUGHT
THE
PROCEEDURES
WERE
SIMMILAR
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
A
LASER
BEING
THE
CUTTING
TOOL
IN
PRK
I
MUST
NOT
BE
UNDERSTANDING
ALL
OF
THE
DIFFERENCES
NO
RK
MAKES
RADIAL
CUTS
AROUND
THE
CIRCUMFERENCE
OF
THE
CORNEA
UP
TO
I
THINK
AND
THESE
CHANGE
THE
CURVATURE
OF
THE
CORNEA
THROUGH
STRESS
CHAGES
PRK
VAPORIZES
BURNS
AWAY
A
THIN
LAYER
FROM
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
CORNEA
MAKING
THE
OPTICAL
AXIS
OF
THE
EYE
SHORTER
THE
LASER
DOESNT
CUT
IN
PRK
IT
VAPORIZES
IN
RK
THE
EYE
IS
CUT
INTO
IN
THE
FAQ
THE
VISION
WAS
CONSIDERED
LESS
CLEAR
AFTER
THE
SURGERY
THAN
WITH
GLASSES
ALONE
IF
THIS
IS
COMPLETLY
ATTRIBUTABLE
TO
THE
INTENTIONAL
SLIGHT
UNDERCORRECTION
THEN
IT
CAN
BE
COMPENSATED
FOR
WHEN
NECESSARY
WITH
GLASSES
OR
CONTACTS
IF
THEY
CAN
BE
WORN
AFTERALL
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
KNOW
IF
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
HOWEVER
AND
SOME
OTHER
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
SURGERY
WOULD
OFTEN
INTERFERE
WITH
CLEAR
VISION
THE
FIRST
THING
THAT
CAME
TO
MY
MIND
WAS
A
FOGGING
OF
THE
LENSE
WHICH
GLASSES
COULDNT
HELP
WOULD
NOT
HELP
I
FIND
MY
VISION
IS
MORE
CLEAR
FOR
SOME
THINGS
AND
LESS
CLEAR
FOR
OTHERS
ONLY
AT
NIGHT
I
NOTICE
A
DEFINITE
HALOING
AT
NIGHT
IN
THE
DARKNESS
WHEN
I
LOOK
AT
AUTOMOBILE
HEADLAMPS
THOUGH
THIS
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
I
SPEND
INORDINATE
AMOUNTS
OF
TIME
DOING
FOR
ORDINARY
THINGS
MY
VISION
IN
PARTICULAR
HAVING
A
FULLYOPERATING
PERIPHERAL
VISION
IS
CLEARER
THAN
WITH
GLASSES
OR
CONTACTS
