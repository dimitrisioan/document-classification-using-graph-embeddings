infant
immune
development
question
as
an
animal
science
student
i
know
that
a
number
of
animals
transfer
immunoglobin
to
thier
young
through
thier
milk
in
fact
a
calf
must
have
a
sufficient
amount
of
colostrum
early
milk
within
hours
to
effectively
develop
the
immune
system
since
for
the
first
less
than
hours
the
intestines
are
open
to
the
ig
passage
my
question
is
does
this
apply
to
human
infants
to
any
degree
thanks

your
time
