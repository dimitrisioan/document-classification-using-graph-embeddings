MEDICINE
IS
NOT
A
TOTALLY
SCIENTIFIC
ENDEVOUR
THE
ACQUISITION
OF
SCIENTIFIC
KNOWLEDGE
IS
COMPLETELY
SCIENTIFIC
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THAT
KNOWLEDGE
IN
INDIVIDUAL
CASES
MAY
BE
MORE
ART
THAN
SCIENCE
THERE
ARE
DISEASES
THAT
HAVENT
BEEN
DESCRIBED
YET
AND
THE
ROOT

OF
MANY
DISEASES
NOW

SOMETIME
IF
YOU
WANT
TO

A

OF
THEM
AFTER
SCIENTIFIC

HAVE
RUN
OUT
THEN
ITS
THE
PATIENTS
FREEDOM
OF
CHOICE
TO
TRY
ANY
EXPERIMENTAL
METHOD
THEY
CHOOSE
AND
ITS
WELL
RECOGNIZED
BY
MANY
DOCTORS
THAT
MEDICINE
DOESNT
HAVE
ALL

CERTAINLY
WE
DONT

THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
MOST
RELIABLE
MEANS
OF
ACQUIRING
FURTHER
MEDICAL
KNOWLEDGE
THE
SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
HAS
PROVEN
ITSELF
TO
BE
RELIABLE
THE
ONLY
REASON
ALTERNATIVE
THERAPIES
ARE
SHUNNED
BY
PHYSICIANS
IS
THAT
THEIR
PRACTITIONERS
REFUSE
TO
SUBMIT
THEIR
THEORIES
TO
RIGOROUS
SCIENTIFIC
SCRUTINY
INSISTING
THAT
TRADITION
OR
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
ARE
SUFFICIENT
THESE
HAVE
BEEN
SHOWN
MANY
TIMES
IN
THE

TO
BE
VERY
UNRELIABLE
WAYS
OF
ACQUIRING

CROOKS

THE
