listen
up
what
are
the
possibilities

transmission
through
swimming
pool
water
especially

the
chlorination
isnt
up

ive
heard
of
community
swimming
pools
refered
to
as
public
urinals
so
what
else
is
going

no
dice

virtually

of

since
the
membrane
is
semipermeable
water
would
rush
in
and
cause
the
cell
to
burst
