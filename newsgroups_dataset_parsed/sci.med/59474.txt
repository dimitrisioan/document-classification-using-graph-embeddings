RE
HELP
FOR
KIDNEY
STONES
WROTE
MY
GIRLFRIEND
IS
IN
PAIN
FROM
KIDNEY
STONES
SHE
SAYS
THAT
BECAUSE
SHE
HAS
NO
MEDICAL
INSURANCE
SHE
CANNOT
GET
THEM
REMOVED
MY
QUESTION
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
SHE
CAN
TREAT
THEM
HERSELF
OR
AT
LEAST
MITIGATE
THEIR
EFFECTS
ANY
HELP
IS
DEEPLY
APPRECIATED
ADVICE
REFERRAL
TO
LITERATURE
ETC
THANK
YOU
DAVE
CARVELL
FIRST
OFF
I
WOULD
CONSIDER
THE
SEVERITY
OF
THE
PAIN
I
HAD
STONES
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
AND
THERES
NOW
WAY
I
COULD
HAVE
MADE
IT
WITHOUT
HEAVY
DUTY
DOSES
OF
MORPHINE
AND
DEMEROL
AND
A
TWO
WEEK
STAY
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
THAT
I
COULD
TAKE
THAT
WOULD
DISSOLVE
THEM
IF
THE
STONES
ARE
PASSIBLE
THE
BEST
THING
SHE
COULD
DO
IS
DRINK
LOTS
OF
WATER
AND
HOPE
THAT
THEY
PASS
BUT
EVERY
TIME
THEY
MOVE
A
LITTLE
THE
PAIN
WILL
BE
EXCRUTIATING
I
WAS
TOLD
BY
MY
DOCTOR
AT
THAT
TIME
THAT
THE
PAIN
WAS
COMPARABLE
TO
THAT
OF
CHILDBIRTH
YES
BY
A
MALE
DOCTOR
SO
IM
SURE
SOME
OF
YOU
WOMEN
WILL
DISAGREE
ID
REALLY
LIKE
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
IN
THIS
SO
MAYBE
SOME
OF
YOU
WOMEN
WHO
HAVE
HAD
A
BABY
AND
A
KIDNEY
STONE
COULD
FILL
ME
