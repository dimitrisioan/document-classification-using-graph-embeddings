OXYGENJUST
LIKE
IT
DOES
IN
THE
VAGINA
AS
MUCH
STUFF
AS
THERE
IS
IN
THE
LAY
PRESS
ABOUT
L
ACIDOPHILUS
AND
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
IM
REALLY
AMAZED
THAT
SOMEONE
HAS
NOT
DONE
A
CLINICAL
TRIAL
YET
TO
CHECK
IT
OUT
IVE
MENTIONED
THIS
STUDY
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
NOW
INGESTION
OF
YOGURT
CONTAINING
LACTOBACILLUS
ACIDOPHILUS
AS
PROPHYLAXIS
FOR
CANDIDAL
VAGINITIS
ANNALS
OF
INTERNAL
MEDICINE
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
STUDY
BECAUSE
THEY
USED
YOGURT
RATHER
THAN
CAPSULES
OF
LACTOBACILLUS
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
HAD
POSITIVE
RESULTS
THE
STUDY
WAS
A
CROSSOVER
TRIAL
OF
DAILY
INGESTION
OF
OUNCES
OF
YOGURT
THERE
WAS
A
MARKED
DECREASE
IN
INFECTIONS
WHILE
WOMEN
WERE
INGESTING
THE
YOGURT
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
STUDY
INCLUDED
VERY
SMALL
NUMBERS
PATIENTS
ENROLLED
AND
MANY
PROTOCOL
VIOLATIONS
ONLY
PATIENTS
WERE
ANALYZED
STILL
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
RATES
OF
INFECTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
GROUPS
WAS
SO
LARGE
THAT
THE
STUDY
REMAINS
FAIRLY
BELIEVABLE
DAVID
RIND
DAVID
THIS
STUDY
LOOKS
LIKE
A
GOOD
ONE
GORDON
RUBENFELD
DID
A
MEDLINE
SEARCH
AND
ALSO
SENT
ME
THE
SAME
REFERENCE
THROUGH
EMAIL
SINCE
COMMERCIAL
YOGURT
DOES
NOT
ALWAYS
HAVE
A
GOOD
LACTOBACILLUS
A
OR
BULGARICUS
CULTURE
A
NEGATIVE
FINDING
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
TOO
INFORMATIVE
THIS
IS
OFTEN
THE
REASON
WHY
LACTOBACILLUS
ACIDOPHILUS
TABLETS
ARE
RECOMMENDED
RATHER
THAN
YOGURT
I
GUESS
THE
NEXT
QUESTION
IS
WHY
WOULD
THIS
INTRODUCTION
OF
GOOD
BACTERIA
BACK
INTO
THE
GUT
DECREASE
THE
INCIDENCE
OF
VAGINAL
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IF
THE
ANUS
WAS
NOT
SERVING
AS
A
CANDIDA
RESERVOIRA
FACT
THAT
GORDON
R
VEHEMENTY
DENYS
I
SEE
TWO
POSSIBLE
THEORIES
ONE
THE
L
ACIDOPHILUS
WHICH
IS
A
FACULTATIVELY
ANAEROBIC
BACTERIUM
COULD
MAKE
IT
THROUGH
THE
GUT
AND
COLONIZE
THE
RECTAL
AREA
TO
OVERGROW
THE
CANDIDA
THIS
WOULD
NOT
EXPLAIN
THE
REOCCURANCE
OF
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IN
THE
VAGINA
AFTER
THE
YOGURT
INGESTION
WAS
STOPPED
THOUGH
THE
OTHER
IS
THAT
THE
ADDITIONAL
BACTERIA
IN
THE
INTESTINAL
TRACT
REMOVE
MOST
OF
THE
GLUCOSE
FROM
THE
FECES
AND
CANDIDA
LOOSES
ITS
MAJOR
FOOD
SOURCE
GETTING
LACTOBACILLUS
ACIDOPHILUS
TO
COLONIZE
THE
VAGINAL
TRACTWHERE
IT
IS
NORMALLY
FOUND
WOULD
HAVE
A
MUCH
BETTER
EFFECT
ON
THE
RECURRANCE
OF
VAGINAL
YEAST
BLOOMS
THOUGH
AN
ACETIC
ACID
LACTOBACILLUS
ACIDOPHILUS
DOUCHE
HAS
BEEN
USED
TO
GET
THIS
EFFECT
BUT
IVE
NOT
SEEN
ANY
SUCH
TREATMENT
REPORTED
IN
THE
MEDICAL
LITERATURE
THIS
WOULD
BE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
PHYSICIANS
CONDUCTING
THEIR
OWN
CLINICAL
TRIALS
TO
TRY
TO
COME
UP
WITH
TREATMENTS
THAT
HELP
THEIR
PATIENTS
WHEN
THIS
IS
DONE
IN
PRIVATE
PRACTICE
THE
RESULTS
ARE
RARELY
IF
EVER
PUBLISHED
IT
WAS
THE
HALLMARK
OF
MEDICINE
UNTIL
THE
MODERN
AGE
EMERGED
WITH
CLINICAL
TRIALS
IT
REALLY
RAISES
A
BIG
QUESTION
DOES
THE
MEDICAL
PROFESSION
CAST
OUT
THE
ADVENTEROUS
FEW
WHO
TRY
NEW
TREATMENTS
TO
HELP
PATIENTS
OR
DOES
IT
LOOK
THE
OTHER
WAY
THIS
PARTICULAR
ISSUE
IS
REALLY
A
VERY
SIMPLE
ONE
SINCE
NO
REAL
DANGEROUS
THERAPY
IS
INVOLVEDEVEN
THE
ANTIFUNGALS
ARE
NOT
ALL
THAT
DANGEROUS
BUT
THERE
ARE
SOME
AREASLIKE
EDTA
CHELATION
THERAPY
WHERE
THE
FIRE
IS
PRETTY
HOT
AND
SOMEBODY
COULD
GET
BURNED
ITS
REALLY
TOUGH
DO
I
FOLLOW
ONLY
WELL
ESTABLISHED
PROTOCOLS
AND
THEN
GIVE
UP
IF
THEY
DONT
WORK
THAT
WELL
OR
DO
IT
TRY
SOMETHING
THAT
LOOKS
LIKE
IT
WILL
WORK
BUT
HASNT
BEEN
PROVEN
TO
WORK
YET
MY
STAND
IS
TO
CONSIDER
OTHER
TREATMENT
POSSIBILITIES
ESPECIALLY
IF
THEY
INVOLVE
LITTLE
OR
NO
RISK
TO
THE
PATIENT
GETTING
GOOD
BACTERIA
BACK
INTO
THE
GUT
AFTER
ANTIBIOTIC
TREATMENT
IS
ONE
TREATMENT
POSSIBILITY
THE
OTHER
IS
GETTING
L
ACIDOPHILUS
INTO
THE
VAGINAL
TRACT
OF
A
WOMAN
WHO
IS
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WITH
RECURRING
YEAST
INFECTIONS
