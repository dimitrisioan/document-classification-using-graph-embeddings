RUSSELL
SINCLAIRDAY
WRITES
WHAT
WE
ARE
REALLY
WORRIED
ABOUT
IS
NOT
KNOWING
THE
FACTS
THE
DOCTOR
HAS
STATED
THAT
THINGS
WILL
NOT
BE
GOOD
IF
SHE
IS
A
CARRIER
AND
AVOIDS
FURTHER
QUESTIONS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
WE
REALLY
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
SO
WE
CAN
TAKE
STEPS
AND
PLAN
IN
ADVANCE
FOR
ANY
EVENTUALITIES
THANKYOU
FOR
YOUR
VERY
INFORMATIVE
POST
RIGHT
NOW
I
AM
JUST
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
EVERYTHING
THAT
I
CAN
RUSS
UNFORTUNATELY
HEP
B
INFECTION
CAN
EVENTUATE
IN
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
AND
SUBSEQUENT
CIRRHOSIS
ALTHOUGH
NOT
MANY
PATIENTS
WITH
HEP
B
GO
ON
TO
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
IT
DOES
STILL
OCCUR
IN
A
GOOD
NUMBER
AND
IS
SOMETHING
TO
KEEP
IN
MIND
HEPATITIS
C
WAS
NONA
NONB
HEP
MUCH
MORE
FREQUENTLY
LEADS
TO
CHRONIC
HEP
AND
CIRRHOSIS
THERE
IS
ALSO
AN
AUTIMMUNE
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
THAT
AFFECTS
MOSTLY
YOUNGER
WOMEN
WHICH
ALSO
LEADS
TO
CIRRHOSIS
OF
COURSE
CIRRHOSIS
IS
A
MOST
UNKIND
DISEASE
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
EFFECTS
RELATE
TO
PORTAL
HYPERTENSION
AND
LOSS
OF
LIVER
FUNCTION
PATIENTS
DEVELOP
LIFETHREATENING
VARICEAL
BLEEDS
AND
HEPATIC
COMAS
AMONG
MANY
OTHER
PROBLEMS
AS
A
RESULT
OF
DISTURBANCES
IN
HEPATIC
CIRCULATION
LESS
OMINOUSLY
THEY
CAN
EXHIBIT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
HYPERESTROGENEMIA
WHICH
OFTEN
CHARACTERIZE
PATIENTS
WITH
CIRRHOSIS
THESE
EFFECTS
INCLUDE
TELANGIACTASIAS
SMALL
RED
SKIN
LESIONS
AND
IN
MEN
GYNECOMASTIA
BREAST
DEVELOPMENT
THE
ONLY
REAL
TREATMENT
FOR
CIRRHOSIS
IS
LIVER
TRANSPLANT
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
CIRRHOSIS
IS
NOT
EXPECTED
AT
LEAST
STATISTICALLY
IN
YOUR
FRIENDS
CASE
NEVERTHELESS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
BRING
UP
THE
SUBJECT
OF
CHRONIC
DISEASE
AND
CIRRHOSIS
WITH
THE
DOCTOR
HOPEFULLY
HE
OR
SHE
CAN
THEN
CAREFULLY
EXPLAIN
THESE
SEQUELAE
OF
HEP
B
INFECTION
TO
YOU
AND
OFFER
YOU
SUPPORT
