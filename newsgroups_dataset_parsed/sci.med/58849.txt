IS
THERE
SUCH
A

MONOSODIUM
GLUTAMATE
SENSITIVITY
I
SAW
IN
THE
NY
TIMES
SUNDAY
THAT
SCIENTISTS
HAVE
TESTIFIED
BEFORE
AN
FDA
ADVISORY
PANEL
THAT
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
MSG
SENSITIVITY
ARE
SUPERSTITION
ANYBODY
HERE
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
IM
OLD
ENOUGH
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
ISSUE
HAS
COME
UP
AT
LEAST
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
SINCE
THE
THEN
IT
WAS
CALLED
THE
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
SYNDROME
BECAUSE
CHINESE
CUISINE
HAS
ALWAYS
USED
IT
SO
FAR
IVE
SEEN
ABOUT
A
DOZEN
POSTS
OF
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
BUT
NO
FACTS
I
SUSPECT
THERE
IS
A
STRONG
PSYCHOLOGICAL
EFFECT
AT

HERE
DOES
ANYONE

THE

LOOK

BY
JOHN
W
OLNEY
A
TOXICOLOGIST
WHO
HAS
STUDIED
THE
EFFECTS
OF
MSG
ON
THE
BRAIN
AND
ON
DEVELOPMENT
IT
IS
UNDISPUTED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
MSG
IS
AN
EXCITOTOXIC
FOOD
ADDITIVE
AND
THAT
ITS
MAJOR
CONSTITUENT
GLUTAMATE
IS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
PREMIERIE
NEUROTRANSMITTER
IN
THE
MAMMALIAN
BRAIN
HUMANS
INCLUDED
TOO
MUCH
IN
THE
DIET
AND
THE
SYSTEM
GETS
THROWN
OFF
GLUTAMATE
AND
ASPARTATE
ALSO
AN
EXCITOTOXIN
ARE
NECESSARY
IN
SMALL
AMOUNTS
AND
ARE
FREELY
AVAILABLE
IN
MANY
FOODS
BUT
THE
AMOUNTS
ADDED
BY
INDUSTRY
ARE
FAR
ABOVE
THE
AMOUNTS
THAT
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
ENCOUNTERED
IN
A
NY
SINGLE
FOOD
BY
EATING
LOTS
OF
JUNK
FOOD
PACKAGED

AND
DIET
SOFT

IT

YOUR

SO
HIGH

ANYONE
WITH
A

TO
THESE

WILL
SUFFER
NUMEROUS

MSG
THAT

GO
THROUGH
BLOODBRAIN
BARRIER
THAT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
MSG
CAN
GO
THROUGH
OR
NOT
IN
NORMAL
CONDITION
THE
CONCENTRATION
OF
GLUTAMATE
IN
THE
CEREBROSPINAL
FLUID
IS
ABOUT

THAT
IS
HIGH
ENOUGH
TO

BUT
THE
QUESTION
IS
NEURON
AND
GLIAL
CELL
IN
THE
BRAIN
HAVE
A
LOTS
OF
TRANSPORT
TO
GET
GLUTAMATE
INTO
NEURON
OR
GLIAL
SO
NO
ONE
KNOW
EXACT
CONCENTRATION
OF
GLUTAMATE

AROUND

GLUTAMATE

IT
IS
