a
recent
movie
lorenzos
oil
offers
a
perfect
example
of
what
im
talking
about
if
you
havent
seen
it
you
should
its
not
i
saw
it
it
is
almost
a
unique
case
in
history
first
ald
is
a
rare
but
fatal
disease
their
accomplishment
was
significant
of
course
it
was
overplayed
in
the
movie
for
dramatic
effect
the
oil
is
not
curative
and
doesnt
even
prevent
progression
only
slows
it
theres
a
pretty
good
article
in
the
the
march
new
scientist
titled
pouring
cold
water
on
lorenzos
oil
the
article
states
that
research
has
shown
that
the
oil
has
no
discernable
effect
on
the
progression
of
the
disease
in
patients
in
which
demyelination
has
begun
in
patients
with
amn
a
less
acute
form
of
the
same
disease
there
is
some
improvement
seen
in
the
ability
of
nerve
fibres
to
conduct
impulses
in
ald
patients
who
have
not
yet
begun
demyelination
the
jury
is
still
