youre
right
that
the
s
vertebrae
are
attached
to
each
other

sacrum
to
my
knowledge

be
adjusted
either

or
by

youre
an
endless
source
of
misinformation
there
are
no
sacral
vertebrae
there
is
a
bone
called
the
sacrum
at
the
end
of
the
spine
it
is
a
single
solid
bone
except
in
a
few
patients
who
have
a
lumbarized
as
a
normal
variant
how
do
you
adjust
a
solid
bone
break
it
no
dont
tell
me
i
dont
want
to
know
oh
come
now
surely
you
know
he
only
meant
to
measure
the
flow
of
electromagnetic
energy
about
the
sacrum
and
then
adjust
these
flows
with
a
crystal
of
chromium
applied
to
the
right
great
toe
