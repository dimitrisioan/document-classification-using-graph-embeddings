RE
SHOULD
I
BE
ANGRY
AT
THIS
DOCTOR
MRYANSTSCIEDU
WRITES
AM
I
JUSTIFIED
IN
BEING
PISSED
OFF
AT
THIS
DOCTOR
LAST
SATURDAY
EVENING
MY
YEAR
OLD
SON
CUT
HIS
FINGER
BADLY
WITH
A
KNIFE
I
TOOK
HIM
TO
A
LOCAL
URGENT
AND
GENERAL
CARE
CLINIC
AT
PM
THE
CLINIC
WAS
OPEN
TILL
PM
THE
RECEPTIONIST
WENT
TO
THE
BACK
AND
TOLD
THE
DOCTOR
THAT
WE
WERE
THERE
AND
CAME
BACK
AND
TOLD
US
THE
DOCTOR
WOULD
NOT
SEE
US
BECAUSE
SHE
HAD
SOMEPLACE
TO
GO
AT
AND
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
BE
DELAYED
HERE
DURING
THE
NEXT
FEW
MINUTES
IN
RESPONSE
TO
MY
QUESTIONS
WITH
SEVERAL
TRIPS
TO
THE
BACK
ROOM
THE
RECEPTIONIST
TOLD
ME
THE
DOCTOR
WAS
DOING
PAPERWORK
IN
THE
BACK
THE
DOCTOR
WOULD
NOT
EVEN
LOOK
AT
HIS
FINGER
TO
ADVISE
US
ON
GOING
TO
THE
EMERGENCY
ROOM
THE
DOCTOR
WOULD
NOT
EVEN
SPEAK
TO
ME
SHE
WOULD
NOT
TELL
ME
THE
DOCTORS
NAME
OR
HER
OWN
NAME
WHEN
ASKED
WHO
IS
IN
CHARGE
OF
THE
CLINIC
SHE
SAID
I
DONT
KNOW
I
REALIZE
THAT
A
PRIVATE
CLINIC
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
AN
EMERGENCY
ROOM
BUT
I
WAS
QUITE
ANGRY
AT
BEING
TURNED
AWAY
BECAUSE
THE
DOCTOR
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
BE
BOTHERED
MY
SON
DID
GET
THREE
STITCHES
AT
THE
EMERGENCY
ROOM
SPEAKING
AS
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
WORKS
IN
AN
URGENT
CARE
CENTER
THE
ABOVE
BEHAVIOR
IS
COMPLETELY
INAPPROPRIATE
IF
A
PATIENT
WHO
REQUIRES
EXTENSIVE
CARE
SHOWS
UP
AT
THE
LAST
MINUTE
WE
ALWAYS
SEE
THEM
AND
GIVE
THEM
APPROPRIATE
CARE
IT
IS
REASONABLE
FOR
A
CLINIC
TO
REFUSE
TO
SEE
PATIENTS
OUTSIDE
OF
ITS
POSTED
HOURS
BUT
WHAT
YOU
DESCRIBE
IS
MISBEHAVIOR
ASK
TO
SPEAK
TO
THE
CLINIC
DIRECTOR
AND
COMPLAIN
WHATEVER
THEIR
ATTITUDE
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
GAIN
FROM
ANGERING
PATIENTS
