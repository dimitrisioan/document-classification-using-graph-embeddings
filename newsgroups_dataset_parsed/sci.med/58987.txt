RISK
WHILE
IN
GRAD
SCHOOL
I
REMEMBER
A
BIOCHEMISTRY
FRIEND
OF
MINE
WORKING
WITH
HEAT
SHOCK
PROTEINS
APPARENTLY
BURNING
PROTEIN
WILL
INDUCE
CHANGES
IN
HE
DNA
WHETHER
THESE
CHANGES
SURVIVE
THE
DENATURING
THAT
OCCURS
DURING
DIGESTION
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
I
NEVER
EAT
BURNT
FOOD
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
ALSO
MANY
WOODS
CONTAIN
TOXINS
AS
THEY
ARE
BURNT
IT
WOULD
SEEM
LOGICAL
THAT
SOME
MAY
VOLATILISE
AND
GET
INTO
THE
BBQED
FOOD
AGAIN
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THESE
TOXINS
ANTIFUNGAL
AND
ANTIWOODEATER
COMPOUNDS
WOULD
SURVIVE
THE
RATHER
HARSH
CONDITIONS
OF
THE
STOMACH
AND
INTESTINE
AND
THEN
WOULD
THEY
BE
ABLE
TO
CROSS
THE
INTESTINAL
MUCOSA
MAYBE
SOMEONE
WITH
MORE
BIOCHEMICAL
BACKGROUND
THAN
MYSELF
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
ANYONE
CAN
SHED
SOME
LIGHT
ON
HEAT
SHOCK
PROTEINS
AND
THE
TOXINS
THAT
MAY
BE
IN
THE
WOOD
USED
TO
MAKE
CHARCOAL
