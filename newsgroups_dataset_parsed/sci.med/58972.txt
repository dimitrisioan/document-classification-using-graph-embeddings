i
believe
it
is
illegal
for
a
residency
to
discriminate
against
fmgs
i
is
that
true
i
know
some
that
wont
even
interview
fmgs
most
programs
discriminate
in
that
given
an
fmg
equally
qualified
as
an
american
they
will
take
the
american
what
rights
do
they
actually
have
does
it
matter
if
they
are
us
citizens
most
are
not
we
have
had
good
luck
with
fmgs
and
bad
luck
some
of
our
very
best
residents
have
been
fmgs
also
our
very
worst
as
it
turns
out
the
worst
fmgs
are
often
us
citizens
that
studied
in
offshore
medical
schools
of
the
residents
fired
for
incompetence
in
the
years
ive
been
here
in
my
department
all
have
been
fmgs
were
us
citizens
who
studied
in
guadalajara
was
a
us
citizen
but
was
trained
in
the
soviet
union
and
one
was
philipina
unfortunately
all
are
now
practicing
medicine
somewhere
of
them
in
neurology
after
having
been
picked
up
by
other
programs
in
psychiatry
and
the
other
in
emergency
medicine
