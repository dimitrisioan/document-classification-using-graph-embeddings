how
to
prevent
kidney
stone
formation
i
got
asked
in
sci
med
nutrition
about
vitamin
c
and
oxalate
production
toxic
kidney
stone
formation
i
decided
to
post
my
answer
here
as
well
because
of
the
recent
question
about
kidney
stones
not
long
after
i
got
into
sci
med
i
got
flamed
by
a
medical
fellow
for
stating
that
magnesium
would
prevent
kidney
stone
formation
im
going
to
state
it
again
here
but
the
best
way
to
prevent
kidney
stones
from
forming
is
to
take
supplements
read
on

find
out
whyi

vitamin

will
form

acid
oxidases
for
both

and
vitamin

one
of
the
best
ways
to
drastically
reduce
this
production
is
not
to
cut
back
on
dietary
intake
of
vitamin
c
or
glycine
but
to
increase
your
intake
of
vitamin
control
of
hyperoxaluria
with
large
doses

pyridoxine
in
patients
with
kidney
stones

patients

this

is
due

oxidases
for

the
effect
is
quite
different
there
are
different
pathways
for
vitamin
c
catabolism
the
pathway
that
leads
to
oxalic
acid
formation
will
usually
have
to
of
the
ingested
dose
going
into
oxalic
acid
but
this
is
highly
variable
and
the
vitamin
c
review
article
pointed
out
that
unless
the
dose
gets
upto
grams
per
day
not
too
much
vitamin
c
gets
catabolized
to
form
oxalic
acid
at
very
high
doses
of

grams

more

the
extra
vitamin

than

can
end
up

is
required
by
more
enzymes
than
any
other
vitamin
in
the
body
there
are
probably
some
enzymes
that
require
vitamin
that
we
dont
know
about
yet
vitamin
c
catabolism
is
still
not
completely
understood
but
the
speculation
is
that
this
other
pathway
that
does
not
form
oxalic
acid
must
have
an
enzyme
in
it
that
requires
differences
in
levels
could
then
explain
the
very
variable
production
of
oxalic
acid
from
a
vitamin
c
challengethis
is
not
the
preferred
route
of
catabolism
increasing
your
intake
of
would
then
result
in
less
oxalic
acid
being
formmed
if
you
take
vitamin
c
supplements
since
the
typical
american
diet
is
deficient
in
some
researchers
believe
that
the
main
cause
of
calciumoxalate
kidney
stones
is
deficiencyespecially
since
so
little
oxalic
acid
gets
absorbed
from
the
gut
diets
providing
to
of
oxalic
acid
per
day
showed
absolutely
no
change
in
urinary
excretion
of
oxalateurol
if
was
present
each
day
there
was
a
significant
increase
in
urinary
oxalate
excretion
here
are
the
high

the
threshold
is

you
can
see
that
you
really
have
a
lot
of
latitude
in
food
selection
a
recent
nengj
med
article
also
points
out
that
one
good
way
to
prevent
kidney
stone
formation
is
to
increase
your
intake
of
calcium
which
will
prevent
most
of
the
dietary
oxalate
from
being
absorbed
at
all
if
you
also
increase
your
intake
of
you
shouldnt
have
to
worry
about
kidney
stones
at
all
the
rda
for

males
and
per

it

more

to

the
usda
food
survey
done
in
had
an
average
intake
of
mg
per
day
for
males
and
per
day
for
females
living
in
the
us
coupled
with
this
low
intake
was
a
high
protein
dietwhich
greatly
increases
the
requirement
as
well
as
the
presence
of
some
of
the
different
drugs
that
either
block
absorption
are
metabolic
antagonists
of
or
promote
excretion
in
the
urine
common
ones
are
birth
control
pills
alcohol
isoniazid
penicillamine
and
corticosteroids
i
tell
my
students
to
supplement
all
their
patients
that
are
going
to
get
any
of
the
drugs
that
increase
the
requirement
the
dose
recommended
for
patients
taking
birth
control
pills
is
per
day
and
this
should
work
for
most
of
the
other
drugs
that
increase
the
requirementthis
would
be
on
top
of
your
dietary
intake
of
any
patient
that
has
a
history
of
kidney
stone
formation
should
be
given
supplements
one
other
good
way
to
prevent
kidney
stone
formation
is
to
make
sure
your
camg

ratio
is
magnesiumoxalate
is

there
are
actually
about
three
times
as
many
articles
published
in
the
medical
literature
on
the
role
of
magnesium
in
preventing
kidney
stone
formation
than
there
are
for
i
thought
that
i
was
being
pretty
safe
in
stating
that
magnesium
would
prevent
kidney
stone
formation
in
an
earlier
post
in
this

group
but
good

a

jumped
all
over
me
i
guess
that
he
doesnt
read
the
medical
literature
oh
well
since
kidney
stones
can
be
a
real
pain
and
a
lot
of
people
suffer
from
them
i
thought
id
tell
you
how
you
can
avoid
the
pain
