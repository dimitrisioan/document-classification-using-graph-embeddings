NUTRASWEET
IS
A
SYNTHETIC
SWEETENER
A
COUPLE
THOUSAND
TIMES
SWEETER
THAN
SUGAR
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
CHEMICALS
THAT
THE
BODY
PRODUCES
WHEN
IT
DEGRADES
NUTRASWEET
IT
IS
THOUGHT
TO
FORM
FORMALDEHYDE
AND
KNOWN
TO
FOR
METHANOL
IN
THE
DEGREDATION
PATHWAY
THAT
THE
BODY
USES
TO
ELIMINATE
SUBSTANCES
THE
REAL
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
THE
LEVELS
OF
METHANOL
AND
FORMALDEHYDE
PRODUCED
ARE
HIGH
ENOUGH
TO
CAUSE
SIGNIFICANT
DAMAGE
AS
BOTH
ARE
TOXIC
TO
LIVING
CELLS
ALL
I
CAN
SAY
IS
THAT
I
WILL
NOT
CONSUME
IT
IN
THE
SEPTEMBER
ISSUE
OF
THE
TUFTS
UNIVERSITY
DIET
AND

LETTER
THERE
IS
A
THREE

ABOUT
ARTIFICIAL
SWEETENERS
WHAT
FOLLOWS
ARE
THOSE
EXCERPTS
WHICH
DEAL
SPECIFICALLY
WITH
NUTRASWEET
REPRODUCED
WITHOUT
PERMISSION
THE
CONTROVERSY
OVER
ASPARTAME
BEGAN
SIX
YEARS
AGO
IN
ENGLAND
WHERE
A
GROUP
OF
RESEARCHERS
FOUND
THAT
ASPARTAME
MARKETED
UNDER
THE
TRADENAME
NUTRASWEET
APPEARS
TO
STIMULATE
APPETITE
AND
PRESUMABLY
THE
EATING
OF
MORE
CALORIES
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
THAN
IF
A
PERSON
SIMPLY
CONSUMED
SUGAR
WHEN
RESEARCHERS
ASKED
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
TO
DRINK
PLAIN
WATER
ASPARTAMESWEETENED
WATER
AND
SUGARED
WATER
THEY
SAID
THAT
OVERALL
THEY
FELT
HUNGRIEST
AFTER
DRINKING
THE
ARTIFICIALLY
SWEETENED
BEVERAGE
THE
STUDY
RECEIVED
WIDESPREAD
MEDIA
ATTENTION
AND
STIRRED
A
GOOD
DEAL
OF
CONCERN
AMONG
THE
ARTIFICIALSWEETENERUSING
PUBLIC
HOWEVER
ITS
RESULTS
WERE
QUESTIONABLE
AT
BEST
SINCE
THE
RESEARCHERS
DID
NOT
GO
ON
TO
MEASURE
WHETHER
THE
INCREASE
IN
APPETITE
DID
ACTUALLY
TRANSLATE
INTO
AN
INCREASE
IN
EATING
THE
TWO
DO
NOT
NECESSARILY
GO
HAND
IN
HAND
IN
THE
YEARS
THAT
FOLLOWED
MORE
THAN
A
DOZEN
STUDIES
EXAMINING
THE
EFFECT
OF
ASPARTAME
ON
APPETITE
AND
EATING
WERE
CONDUCTED
AND
AFTER
REVIEWING
EVERY
ONE
OF
THEM
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
THE
LABORATORY

THE

INGESTIVE

AT

BARBARA
ROLLS

CONCLUDED
THAT
CONSUMING
ASPARTAME
SWEETENED
FOODS
AND
DRINKS
IS
NOT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
ANY
INCREASE
IN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
FOOD
EATEN
AFTERWARD
ONE
ARTIFICIAL
SWEETENER
THAT
IS
NOT
TYPICALLY
ACCUSED
OF
CAUSING
CANCER
IS
ASPARTAME
BUT
IT
MOST
CERTAINLY
HAS
BEEN
BLAMED
FOR
A
HOST
OF
OTHER
ILLS
SINCE
ITS
INTRODUCTION
IN
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
RECEIVED
THOUSANDS
OF
COMPLAINTS
ACCUSING
IT
OF
CAUSING
EVERYTHING
FROM

TO

STILL
YEARS
OF
CAREFUL
SCIENTIFIC

CONDUCTED

BEFORE

AFTER

ENTERING

HAVE
FAILED
TO
