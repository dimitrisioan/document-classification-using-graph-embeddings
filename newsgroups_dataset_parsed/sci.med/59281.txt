FIBROMYALGIA
CFS
AND
SLEEP
LEVELS
I
KNOW
THAT
THERE
IS
A
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
FIBROMYALGIA
AND
DEEP
SLEEP
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
ARE
FIVE
LEVELS
OF
SLEEP
I
THINK
THAT
REM
SLEEP
IS
THE
THIRD
DEEPEST
LEVEL
OF
SLEEP
AND
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
DEEPER
LEVELS
OF
SLEEP
IF
I
AM
IN
ERROR
IN
ANY
OF
THIS
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
WHICH
LEVEL
OF
SLEEP
IS
THOUGHT
TO
BE
DEFICIENT
IN
PEOPLE
WITH
FIBROMYALGIA
ARE
THERE
ANY
KNOWN
SLEEP
DISTURBANCES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CFS
WHAT
SLEEP
DISTURBANCES
IF
ANY
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CLINICAL
DEPRESSION
DO
ANTIDEPRESSANTS
CORRECT
THE
SLEEP
DISTURBANCES
IN
THESE
DISEASES
ARE
THERE
ANY
GOOD
BOOKS
OR
MEDICAL
JOURNAL
ARTICLES
ABOUT
SLEEP
DISTURBANCES
AND
THESE
DISEASES
