RE
THYROIDAL
DEFICIENCY
IN
ARTICLE
EWOLFFPSICACUK
ERIK
THE
VIKING
WRITES
SHE
HAS
BEEN
TO
A
DOCTOR
AND
TAKEN
THE
ORDINARY
TESTS
AND
HER
VALUES
WERE
REGARDED
AS
LOW
THE
DOCTOR
AND
MY
WIFE
ARE
NOT
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
STARTING
MEDICATION
AS
THIS
DEACTIVATES
THE
GLAND
GIVING
LIFELONG
DEPENDENCY
TO
THE
DRUG
HORMONE
THIS
IS
RIDICULOUS
AND
YOUR
DOCTOR
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
NUT
IF
WHAT
IS
REPORTED
HERE
IS
WHAT
THE
DOCTOR
ACTUALLY
SAID
IF
YOUR
WIFES
PANCREAS
STOPS
PRODUCING
INSULIN
AND
THEREFORE
BECOMES
DIABETIC
SHELL
NEED
INSULIN
REPLACEMENT
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
SHES
DEPENDENT
ON
INSULIN
ANYMORE
THAN
SHE
WAS
BEFOREHANDIF
HER
BODY
DOESNT
MAKE
ENOUGH
SHELL
HAVE
TO
GET
IT
ELSEWHERE
ORAL
THYROID
REPLACEMENT
HORMONE
THERAPY
IS
THE
CORNERSTONE
OF
TREATMENT
FOR
HYPOTHYROIDISM
AND
ITS
REALLY
THE
ONLY
EFFECTIVE
THERAPY
AVAILABLE
ANYWAY
PLUS
ITS
CHEAP
TAKING
THYROID
HORMONE
WHEN
IT
ISNT
NEEDED
DOES
CAUSE
YOUR
THYROID
GLAND
TO
REDUCE
ITS
OWN
PRODUCTION
OF
THE
HORMONE
BUT
THATS
A
FEATURE
NOT
A
BUG
AND
ITS
IRRELEVANT
IN
ANY
CASE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
HYPOTHYROIDISM
BECAUSE
HER
PROBLEM
THAT
HER
GLAND
ISNT
PRODUCING
ENOUGH
THERE
ISNT
A
CLINICAL
PHENOMENON
OF
THYROID
INSUFFICIENCY
CAUSED
BY
A
SUDDEN
DISCONTINUATION
OF
EXOGENOUS
THYROID
HORMONE
ANALOGOUS
TO
ADRENAL
INSUFFICIENCY
CAUSED
BY
THE
SUDDEN
CESSATION
OF
PROLONGED
ADMINISTRATION
OF
CORTICOSTEROIDS
SO
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NO
WORRY
ABOUT
INAPPROPRIATELY
SUPPRESSING
THE
THYROID
GLAND
THE
LAST
COUPLE
OF
MONTHES
SHE
HAS
BEEN
SEEING
A
HOEMOEPATH
SP
AND
BEEN
GIVEN
SOME
DROPS
TO
REACTIVATE
EITHER
HER
THYROIDAL
GLAND
ANDOR
THE
MESSAGECENTER
IN
THE
BRAIN
SORRY
ABOUT
THE
APPROXIMATE
LANGUAGE
BUT
I
HAVENT
GOT
MANY
CLUES
TO
WHAT
THE
ENGLISH
TERMS
ARE
BUT
THE
BRAINAREA
IS
CALLED
THE
HYPOFYSE
IN
NORWEGIAN
HOMEOPATHY
IS
NONSENSE
TELL
HER
TO
STOP
WASTING
HER
MONEY
HEALTH
AND
TIME
AND
GET
HER
TO
A
LEGITIMATE
DOCTOR
WHO
WILL
BE
IN
A
POSITION
TO
MAKE
A
PROPER
DIAGNOSIS
AND
RECOMMEND
THE
RIGHT
THERAPY
