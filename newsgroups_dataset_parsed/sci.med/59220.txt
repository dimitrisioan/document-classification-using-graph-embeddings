RE
DIET
FOR
CROHNS
IBD
ONE
THING
THAT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IN
THIS
THREAD
IS
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
RELATION
BETWEEN
IBD
INFLAMMATION
AND
THE
PROFILE
OF
INGESTED
FATTY
ACIDS
FAS
I
WAS
DIAGNOSED
LAST
MAY
WCROHNS
OF
THE
TERMINAL
ILEUM
WHEN
I
GOT
OUT
OF
THE
HOSPITAL
I
READ
UP
ON
IT
A
BIT
AND
CAME
ACROSS
SEVERAL
STUDIES
INVESTIGATING
THE
ROLE
OF
EPA
AN
ESSENTIALLY
FA
IN
REDUCING
INFLAMMATION
THE
EVIDENCE
WAS
MIXED
MANY
OF
THESE
STUDIES
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
INFLAMMATORY
BOWEL
DISEASE
MACDERMOTT
STENSON
BUT
IF
I
RECALL
CORRECTLY
THERE
WERE
SOME
METHODOLOGICAL
BONES
TO
BE
PICKED
WITH
THE
STUDIES
BOTH
THE
ONES
WPOS
AND
WNEG
RESULTS
IN
THE
STUDIES
PATIENTS
WERE
GIVEN
EPA
A
FEW
GRAMSDAY
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
STUDIES
BUT
IF
I
RECALL
CORRECTLY
THERE
WAS
NO
RESTRICTION
OF
THE
OTHER
FAS
THAT
THE
PATIENTS
COULD
CONSUME
FROM
THE
INFORMED
LAYPERSONS
PERSPECTIVE
THIS
SEEMS
MISTAKEN
IF
LOTS
OF
FAS
ARE
CONSUMED
ALONG
WITH
THE
EPA
THEN
THE
RATIO
OF
BAD
PROSTANOID
PRODUCTS
TO
GOOD
PROSTANOID
PRODUCTS
COULD
STILL
BE
FAIRLY
BAD
ISNT
THIS
RATIO
THE
ISSUE
WHATS
THE
VIEW
OF
THE
GASTRO
COMMUNITY
ON
EPA
THESE
DAYS
EPA
SUPPLEMENTS
ALONG
WITH
A
FAIRLY
SEVERE
RESTRICTION
OF
OTHER
FAS
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
HELPED
ME
SIGNIFICANTLY
THOUGH
IT
COULD
JUST
BE
THE
LOW
ABSOLUTE
AMOUNT
OF
FAT
I
EAT
CALORIES
