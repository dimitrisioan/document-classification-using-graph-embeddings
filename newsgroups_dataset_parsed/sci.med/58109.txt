RE
SINUS
VS
MIGRAINE
WAS
RE
SINUS
ENDOSCOPY
I
NOTICED
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
THAT
WHEN
I
TOOK
ANALGESICS
FAIRLY
REGULARLY
MOTRIN
AT
THE
TIME
I
SEEMED
TO
GET
A
LOT
OF
MIGRAINES
BUT
HAD
FORGOTTEN
ABOUT
THAT
UNTIL
I
STARTED
READING
SOME
OF
THE
POSTS
HERE
I
GENERALLY
DONT
TAKE
NSAIDS
OR
TYLENOL
FOR
HEADACHES
BECAUSE
IVE
FOUND
THEM
TO
BE
INEFFECTIVE
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
TWO
OTHER
PAIN
SOURCES
THAT
FORCE
ME
TO
TAKE
NSAIDS
CURRENTLY
NAPROSYN
FIRST
IS
SOME
PELVIC
PAIN
THAT
I
GET
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
MY
PERIOD
AND
THEN
MUCH
WORSE
AT
MIDCYCLE
I
HAVE
HAD
SURGERY
FOR
ENDOMETRIOSIS
IN
THE
PAST
YEARS
AGO
SO
THE
DRS
TELL
ME
THAT
MY
PAIN
IS
PROBABLY
DUE
TO
THE
ENDOMETRIOSIS
COMING
BACK
IVE
TRIED
SYNAREL
IT
REDUCED
THE
PAIN
WHILE
I
TOOK
IT
MOS
BUT
THE
PAIN
RETURNED
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
I
STOPPED
THREE
DOCTORS
HAVE
SUGGESTED
HYSTERECTOMY
AS
THE
ONLY
REAL
SOLUTION
TO
MY
PROBLEM
ALTHOUGH
I
DONT
EXPECT
TO
HAVE
ANY
MORE
CHILDREN
I
DONT
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
HAVING
MY
UTERUS
AND
ONE
REMAINING
OVARY
REMOVED
THE
FIRST
OVARY
WAS
REMOVED
WHEN
I
HAD
THE
SURGERY
FOR
ENDOMETRIOSIS
ONE
OF
THE
DRS
THAT
SUGGESTED
I
GET
A
HYSTERECTOMY
IS
AN
EXPERT
IN
LASER
SURGERY
BUT
PERHAPS
THINKS
THAT
TYPE
OF
PROCEDURE
IS
ONLY
WORTHWHILE
ON
WOMEN
WHO
STILL
PLAN
TO
HAVE
CHILDREN
SO
BASICALLY
ALL
IM
LEFT
WITH
IS
TOUGHING
OUT
THE
PAIN
THIS
WOULD
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
WITHOUT
NAPROSYN
OR
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
BUT
NOT
ASPIRIN
THAT
DOESNT
WORK
AND
MOTRIN
GAVE
ME
HORRIBLE
GASTRITIS
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
SO
IM
THROUGH
WITH
IT
IN
FACT
NAPROSYN
WORKS
VERY
WELL
AT
ELIMINATING
THE
PAIN
IF
I
TAKE
IT
REGULARLY
AS
I
DID
WHEN
I
HAD
SEVERE
BACK
PAIN
AND
PAIN
IN
BOTH
LEGS
AS
ILL
DISCUSS
IN
A
MOMENT
GENERALLY
THOUGH
I
WAIT
UNTIL
I
HAVE
THE
PAIN
BEFORE
I
TAKE
THE
NAPROSYN
BUT
THEN
IT
TAKES
SEVERAL
HOURS
FOR
IT
REDUCE
THE
PAIN
ITS
ACTUALLY
QUITE
EFFECTIVE
AT
REDUCING
THE
PAIN
IT
JUST
TAKES
QUITE
A
WHILE
IN
THE
MEANTIME
IM
FREQUENTLY
IN
SEVERE
PAIN
THE
OTHER
PAIN
SOURCE
I
HAVE
IS
CHRONIC
LOWER
BACK
PAIN
RESULTING
IN
BILATERAL
RADICULOPATHY
IVE
HAD
MRIS
XRAYS
CT
SCAN
AND
EMGS
IVE
HAD
OF
THEM
AND
DONT
INTEND
TO
EVER
DO
THAT
AGAIN
WITH
NERVE
CONDUCTION
TESTS
THE
TESTS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
CONCLUSIVE
AS
TO
WHAT
IS
CAUSING
MY
BACK
AND
LEG
PAIN
THE
MRI
REPORTS
BOTH
SAY
I
HAVE
SEVERAL
BULGING
DEGENERATIG
DISKS
AND
FROM
THE
XRAYS
AND
MRI
I
THINK
IT
IS
APPARENT
THAT
I
HAVE
ARTHRITIS
THE
READING
ON
THE
CT
SCAN
WAS
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
HERNIATIONS
AND
BUT
OTHERS
HAV
LOOKED
AT
THE
FILMS
AND
CONCLUDED
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
HERNIATIONS
THE
SECOND
EMG
AND
NERVE
CONDUCTION
STUDIES
SHOWS
SIGNIFICANT
DENERVATION
COMPARED
TO
THE
FIRST
EMG
OH
YEAH
I
HAD
SOME
OTHER
HORRIBLE
TEST
CALLED
SOMETHING
LIKE
SOMATIC
EVOKED
RESPONSE
WHICH
SHOWED
THAT
THE
INTERNAL
NERVES
ARE
WORKING
FINE
ANYWAY
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
THAT
I
SOMETIMES
HAVE
SEVERE
PAIN
IN
BOTH
LEGS
AND
BACK
PAIN
THE
BACK
PAIN
IS
THERE
ALL
THE
TIME
BUT
I
CAN
LIVE
WITH
IT
WHEN
THE
LEG
PAIN
IS
THERE
I
NEED
SOME
ANALGESICANTIINFLAMMATORY
MEDICATION
TO
REDUCE
THE
PAIN
TO
A
LEVEL
WHERE
I
CAN
WORK
SO
I
TOOK
NAPROSYN
REGULARY
FOR
MONTHS
EVERY
TIME
I
TRIED
TO
STOP
THE
LEG
PAIN
GOT
WORSE
SO
ID
ALWAYS
RESUME
SINCE
LAST
NOVEMBER
I
HAVE
TAKEN
IT
MUCH
LESS
FREQUENTLY
AND
PRIMARILY
FOR
THE
PELVIC
PAIN
I
HAVE
BEEN
GOING
TO
PHYSICAL
THERAPY
FOR
THE
LAST
MONTHS
TIMES
A
WEEK
AFTER
THE
FIRST
MONTH
OR
SO
MY
THERAPIST
PUT
ME
ON
PELVIC
TRACTION
SHE
HAD
TRIED
IT
EARLIER
BUT
IT
HAD
CAUSED
A
LOT
OF
PAIN
IN
MY
BACK
THIS
TIME
SHE
TRIED
IT
AT
A
LOWER
WEIGHT
AFTER
A
MONTH
OR
TWO
THE
PAIN
IN
MY
LEGS
BEGAN
GOING
AWAY
BUT
THE
TRACTION
AWAYS
CAUSED
DISCOMFORT
IN
MY
LOWER
BACK
WHICH
COULD
BE
REDUCED
WITH
ULTRASOUND
AND
MASSAGE
SO
NOW
I
DONT
HAVE
NEARLY
AS
MUCH
PAIN
IN
MY
LEGS
IN
FACT
MY
THERAPIST
TOOK
ME
OFF
TRACTION
ABOUT
WEEKS
AGO
GETTING
BACK
TO
MY
ORIGINAL
REASON
FOR
THIS
POST
EVEN
IF
I
CAN
AVOID
TAKING
ANALGESIC
FOR
HEADACHES
I
REALLY
CANT
AVOID
THEM
ENTIRELY
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
OTHER
PAIN
SOURCES
THAT
FORCE
ME
TO
USE
THEM
OH
I
FORGOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
IT
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
TO
ME
THAT
I
HAVE
BACK
SURGERY
BUT
IM
AVOIDING
THAT
TOO
I
FIND
THE
MIGRAINES
DIFFICULT
TO
DEAL
WITH
OCCASSIONALLY
I
HAVE
TO
TAKE
OFF
WORK
BUT
USUALLY
I
CAN
WORK
BUT
AT
A
REDUCED
CAPACITY
IM
A
SYSTEMS
ENGINEER
AND
DO
A
LOT
OF
READING
AND
WRITING
WHEN
THE
PELVIC
PAIN
IS
BAD
I
CANT
CONCENTRATE
MUCH
I
USUALLY
END
UP
JUMPING
OUT
OF
MY
CHAIR
EVERY
FEW
MINUTES
BECAUSE
THE
PAIN
IS
SO
BOTHERSOME
WHEN
THE
PAIN
IN
MY
BACK
IS
BAD
IT
CAN
CAUSE
SEVERE
BURNING
IN
BOTH
LEGS
SHOOTING
PAINS
IN
MY
LEGS
ELECTRIC
SHOCK
TYPE
OF
PAIN
IN
MY
FEET
AND
TOES
AND
BASICALLY
WHEN
IT
GETS
BAD
I
CANT
REALLY
SIT
AT
ALL
THEN
I
END
UP
SPENDING
MOST
OF
MY
TIME
HOME
AND
IN
BED
SO
EVEN
IF
THE
ANALGESICS
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THE
MIGRAINES
THE
MIGRAINES
ARE
MORE
TOLERABLE
THAN
THE
OTHER
PAIN
SOURCES
I
GET
A
LOT
OF
MIGRAINES
AN
AVERAGE
OF
TO
A
MONTH
WHICH
LAST
DAYS
IVE
TAKEN
CAFERGOT
THE
FIRST
TIME
THE
CAFFIENE
REALLY
GOT
TO
ME
SO
I
REDUCED
THE
DOSAGE
BUT
I
DONT
LIKE
THE
SIDE
EFFECTS
IF
I
TAKE
MORE
THAN
TWO
I
GET
DIAHREA
IF
I
GET
A
VERY
BAD
HEADACHE
I
WILL
EVENTUALLY
TAKE
THE
CAFERGOT
MY
NEUROLOGIST
WASNT
VERY
HELPFUL
WHEN
I
TOLD
HIM
MY
PROBLEMS
WITH
CAFERGOT
HE
SAID
THAT
WHEN
SUMATRIPTAN
BECOMES
AVAILABLE
I
SHOULD
TRY
THAT
IVE
TRIED
SEVERAL
OTHER
MEDICATIONS
FIORNAL
MIDRIN
FIORNAL
WITH
CODEINE
TEGRETOL
AND
INDERAL
BUT
THEY
EITHER
DIDNT
WORK
OR
I
COULDNT
TOLERATE
THEM
SO
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
MY
DOCTORS
SEEM
TO
BE
SATISFIED
WITH
ME
JUST
TRYING
TO
TOLERATE
THE
PAIN
WHICH
I
AGREE
WITH
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
BUT
NOT
WHEN
I
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
PAIN
IVE
HAD
SOME
BAD
EXPERIENCES
WITH
SURGERY
MY
HEART
STOPPED
ONCE
FROM
THE
ANESTHESIA
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
WAS
LIKELY
THE
SUCCINYLCHOLINE
AND
IVE
ALREADY
HAD
SURGERY
SEVERAL
TIMES
ANYWAY
THE
POINT
OF
WHAT
IM
SAYING
IS
THAT
EVEN
IF
ANALGESICS
CAN
CONTRIBUTE
TO
MIGRAINES
SOME
PEOPLE
NEED
TO
TAKE
THEM
TO
TOLERATE
OTHER
PAIN
