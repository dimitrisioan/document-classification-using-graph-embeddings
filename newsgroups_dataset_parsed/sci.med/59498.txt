move
a

the
pain
will
be
excrutiating
i
was
told
by
my
doctor
at
that
time
that
the
pain
was
comparable
to
that
of
childbirth
yes
by
a
male
doctor
so
im
sure
some
of
you
women
will
disagree
id
really
like
to
know
the
truth
in
this
so
maybe
some
of
you
women
who
have
had
a
baby
and
a
kidney
stone
could
fill
me
in
ive
had
neither
a
baby
nor
a
kidney
stone
but
according
to
my
aunt
who
has
had
plenty
of
both
a
kidney
stone
is
worse
