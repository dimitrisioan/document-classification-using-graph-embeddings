ASHWIN
RAM
WRITES
OUR
SON
HAS
STARTED
FALLING
SICK
QUITE
OFTEN
EVERY
SINCE
HE
STARTED
GOING
TO
DAY
CARE
HE
WAS
AT
HOME
FOR
THE
FIRST
YEAR
AND
HE
DID
NOT
FALL
SICK
EVEN
ONCE
NOW
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
HE
HAS
SOME
SORT
OF
COLD
OR
FLU
PRETTY
MUCH
ONCE
A
MONTH
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THE
COLD
LEADS
TO
AN
EAR
INFECTION
AS
WELL
WITH
THE
RESULT
THAT
HE
ENDS
UP
BEING
ON
ANTIBIOTICS
WEEKS
OUT
OF
I
KNOW
KIDS
IN
DAY
CARE
FALL
SICK
MORE
OFTEN
BUT
WE
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
WONDER
HOW
OFTEN
MORE
OFTEN
REALLY
IS
WHETHER
OUR
SON
IS
MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE
OR
HAS
LOWER
IMMUNITY
THAN
AVERAGE
ARE
THERE
ANY
STUDIES
THAT
CAN
HELP
ANSWER
SOME
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
WHEN
KIDS
STAYED
IN
THE
HOME
UNTIL
KINDERGARDEN
OR
GRADE
INFECTION
INCIDENCE
WAS
MUCH
LOWER
BECAUSE
EXPOSURE
WAS
LOWER
SOME
STUDIES
SUGGEST
THAT
EARLY
EXPOSURE
TO
VARIOUS
INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
IS
PROBABLY
BENEFICIAL
BECAUSE
EXPOSURE
AS
AN
ADULT
CARRIES
MUCH
MORE
RISK
OF
MORBITITY
AND
MORTALITYMUMPS
MEASLES
ETC
HOW
OFTEN
DO
KIDS
IN
THEIR
FIRST
SECOND
AND
THIRD
YEARS
FALL
SICK
HOW
OFTEN
DO
THEY
GET
COLDS
FLUS
EAR
INFECTIONS
IS
THERE
ANY
DATA
ON
HOME
CARE
VS
DAY
CARE
DAYCARE
WILL
ALWAYS
CARRY
A
HIGHER
EXPOSURE
RISK
THAN
HOME
CARE
DOES
BEING
SICK
BUILD
IMMUNITY
LEADING
TO
LESS
ILLNESS
LATER
DOES
IT
MAKE
KIDS
WEAKER
LEADING
TO
MORE
ILLNESS
LATER
OR
DOES
IT
NOT
HAVE
ANY
LONG
TERM
EFFECT
EXPOSURE
TO
INFECTIOUS
ORGANISMS
DOES
BUILD
IMMUNITY
BUT
MANY
VIRUSES
MUTATE
AND
REEXPOSURE
TO
THE
NEW
STRAIN
REQUIRES
ANOTHER
IMMUNE
RESPONSE
NEW
ANTIBODY
PRODUCTION
IN
ADDITION
ANTIBODY
LEVELS
TEND
TO
DECLINE
WITH
TIME
AND
REINNOCULATION
IS
NEEDED
TO
KEEP
THE
ANTIBODY
LEVELS
HIGH
CHRONIC
OVERSTIMULATION
OF
THE
IMMUNE
RESPONSE
CAN
LEAD
TO
IMMUNOSUPRESSION
BUT
THIS
IS
RARE
AND
VERY
UNLIKELY
TO
OCCUR
IN
CHILDREN
DOES
TAKING
ANTIBIOTICS
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
HAVE
ANY
NEGATIVE
LONG
TERM
EFFECTS
YES
CHRONIC
USE
OF
ANTIBIOTICS
CAN
HAVE
AN
ADVERSE
EFFECT
ON
THE
GOOD
BACTERIA
THAT
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
PRESENT
IN
AND
ON
THE
BODY
HEALTH
EFFECTS
OF
THIS
DEPLETION
OF
THE
GOOD
BACTERIA
IS
A
VERY
HOTLY
DEBATED
TOPIC
IN
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
WITH
MOST
PHYSICIANS
SEEMING
TO
DISCOUNT
ANY
HEALTH
EFFECTS
OF
CHRONIC
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
A
VIEW
THAT
I
DO
NOT
SUPPORT
HOW
DOES
ONE
TELL
IF
A
CHILD
IS
MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ILLNESS
THAN
NORMAL
AND
WHAT
DOES
ONE
DO
ABOUT
IT
CHRONIC
INFECTION
IN
AN
ADULT
OR
A
CHILD
NEEDS
TO
BE
WORKED
UP
IN
MY
OPINION
BUT
MOST
PHYSICIANS
FEEL
THAT
CHRONIC
INFECTION
IN
A
CHILD
IS
NORMAL
BECAUSE
OF
BOTH
EXPOSURE
AND
LACK
OF
PRIOR
IMMUNITY
TO
MANY
INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
I
DO
NOT
SHARE
THIS
VIEW
AND
THERE
ARE
SOME
PHYSICIANS
WHO
ALSO
SUSPECT
THAT
DIET
PLAYS
A
BIG
ROLE
IN
INFECTION
FREQUENCY
AND
SEVERITY
EXPOSURE
TO
AN
INFECTIOUS
AGENT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
RESULT
IN
A
SEVERE
INFECTION
A
STRONG
IMMUNE
RESPONSE
CAN
MINIMIZE
THE
LENGTH
OF
TIME
NEEDED
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
INFECTION
AS
WELL
AS
THE
SYMPTOMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
INFECTION
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
TO
BUILD
IMMUNITY
AND
RESISTANCE
THERE
ARE
FIVE
MAJOR
NUTRIENTS
THAT
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
A
GOOD
STRONG
IMMUNE
RESPONSE
TO
INFECTIOUS
AGENTS
THEY
ARE
PROTEIN
VITAMIN
C
VITAMIN
A
IRON
AND
ZINC
THE
AMERICAN
DIET
IS
NOT
LOW
IN
PROTEIN
SO
THIS
IS
RARELY
A
PROBLEM
BUT
VITAMIN
A
VITAMIN
C
IRON
AND
ZINC
ARE
OFTEN
LOW
AND
THIS
LACK
OF
AN
ADEQUATE
POOLNUTRIENT
RESERVE
CAN
IMPAIR
THE
IMMUNE
RESPONSE
IRON
IS
KNOW
TO
BE
LOW
IN
MOST
KIDSAS
IS
VITAMIN
A
THERE
ARE
DISTINCT
BIOCHEMICAL
TESTS
THAT
CAN
BE
RUN
TO
CHECK
THE
STATUS
OF
EACH
OF
THESE
NUTRIENTS
IN
A
PATIENT
WHO
IS
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WITH
CHRONIC
SEVERE
INFECTION
SERUM
FERRITIN
FOR
IRON
STATUS
DARK
ADAPTATION
FOR
VITAMIN
A
STATUS
RED
BLOOD
CELL
ZINC
FOR
ZINC
STATUS
AND
LECKOCYTE
ASCORBATE
FOR
VITAMIN
C
STATUS
I
HAVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
WORK
UP
POSTS
ON
THESE
FIVE
NUTRIENTS
AND
THEIR
ROLE
IN
INFECTION
FOR
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
AS
WELL
AS
THE
OTHERS
THAT
I
PARTICIPATE
IN
I
CAN
EMAIL
YOU
WHAT
IVE
WORKED
UP
SO
FAR
BUT
MY
BEST
ADVICE
TO
YOU
IS
TO
TRY
TO
FIND
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
RECOGNIZES
THE
CRITICAL
ROLE
THAT
DIET
PLAYS
IN
THE
HUMAN
IMMUNE
RESPONSE
YOU
MAY
ALSO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
HELP
FROM
A
NUTRITIONIST
ANYONE
CAN
CALL
THEMSELVES
A
NUTRITIONIST
SO
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
VERY
CAREFULL
YOU
WANT
TO
FIND
SOMEONE
LIKE
MYSELF
WHO
HAS
HAD
SOME
FORMAL
TRAINING
AND
EDUCATION
IN
NUTRITION
MANY
PHD
PROGRAMS
IN
THE
US
NOW
OFFER
DEGREES
IN
NUTRITION
AND
THATS
WHAT
YOU
NEED
TO
LOOK
FOR
SOME
DIETICIANS
WILL
ALSO
CALL
THEMSELVES
NUTRITIONISTS
BUT
MOST
DIETICIANS
HAVE
NOT
HAD
THE
BIOCHEMICAL
TRAINING
NEEDED
TO
RUN
SPECIALIZED
NUTRITIONAL
ASSESSMENT
TESTS
THEY
ARE
VERY
GOOD
FOR
GETTING
GENERAL
DIETARY
ADVICE
FROM
HOWEVER
ANY
DATA
INFORMATION
OR
ADVICE
RELATING
TO
THIS
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
THANKS
