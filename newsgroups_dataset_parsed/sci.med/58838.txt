RELATIONSHIP
PROBLEM
I
NEED
ADVICE
WITH
A
SITUATION
WHICH
OCCURRED
BETWEEN
ME
AND
A
PHYSICAN
WHICH
UPSET
ME
I
SAW
THIS
DOCTOR
FOR
A
PROBLEM
WITH
RECURRING
PAIN
HE
SUGGESTED
MEDICATION
AND
A
COURSE
OF
TREATMENT
AND
TOLD
ME
THAT
I
NEED
TO
CALL
HIM
DAYS
AFTER
I
BEGIN
THE
MEDICATION
SO
THAT
HE
MAY
MONITOR
ITS
EFFECTIVENESS
AS
WELL
AS
MY
GENERAL
HEALTH
I
DID
EXACTLY
AS
HE
ASKED
AND
MADE
THE
CALL
REACHING
HIS
SECRETARY
I
EXPLAINED
TO
HER
THAT
I
WAS
FOLLOWING
UP
AT
THE
DOCTORS
REQUEST
AND
THAT
I
WAS
WORRIED
BECAUSE
THE
PAIN
EPISODES
WERE
BECOMING
MORE
FREQUENT
AND
THE
MEDICATION
DID
NOT
SEEM
EFFECTIVE
THE
DOCTOR
CALLED
ME
BACK
AND
HIS
FIRST
WORDS
WERE
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
YOUD
BETTER
MAKE
IT
QUICK
IM
VERY
BUSY
AND
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
CHIT
CHAT
WITH
YOU
I
TOLD
HIM
I
WAS
SIMPLY
FOLLOWING
HIS
INSTRUCTIONS
TO
CALL
ON
THE
DAY
TO
STATUS
HIM
AND
THAT
I
WAS
FEELING
WORSE
I
THEN
ASKED
IF
PERHAPS
THERE
WAS
A
BETTER
TIME
FOR
US
TO
TALK
WHEN
HE
HAD
MORE
TIME
HE
RESPONDED
JUST
SPIT
IT
OUT
NOW
BECAUSE
NO
TIME
IS
A
GOOD
TIME
SAID
IN
A
RAISED
VOICE
I
STARTED
TO
FEEL
UPSET
AND
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
QUICKLY
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
WITH
MY
CONDITION
BUT
MY
NERVOUSNESS
INTERFERED
WITH
MY
CHOICE
OF
WORDS
AND
I
KIND
OF
STUTTERED
AND
THEN
SAID
WELL
NEVER
MIND
AND
HE
SAID
HELL
TALK
TO
VARIOUS
COLLEAGUES
ABOUT
OTHER
MEDICATIONS
AND
HELL
CALL
ME
SOME
OTHER
TIME
THIS
DOCTOR
CALLED
ME
THAT
EVENING
AND
SAID
BECAUSE
I
DIDNT
EXPRESS
MYSELF
WELL
HE
WAS
CONFUSED
ABOUT
WHAT
I
WANTED
AT
THIS
POINT
I
WAS
PRETTY
UPSET
AND
I
TOLD
HIM
IN
AN
AMAZINGLY
POLITE
VOICE
CONSIDERING
HOW
ANGRY
I
FELT
THAT
HIS
EARLIER
MANNER
HAD
HURT
MY
FEELINGS
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
HE
JUST
DOESNT
HAVE
TIME
TO
RAP
WITH
PATIENTS
AND
THOUGHT
THAT
WAS
WHAT
I
WANTED
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
TO
ASSUME
I
WAS
CALLING
TO
RAP
WAS
INSULTING
AND
SAID
AGAIN
THAT
I
WAS
JUST
FOLLOWING
THROUGH
ON
HIS
ORDERS
HE
RESPONDED
THAT
HE
RESENTED
THE
IMPLICATION
THAT
HE
FELT
I
WAS
MAKING
THAT
HE
WAS
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
LEARNING
ABOUT
WHAT
HIS
PATIENTS
HAVE
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THEIR
CONDITION
STATUS
HE
THEN
GAVE
ME
THIS
APOLOGY
I
AM
SORRY
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
MISCOMMUNICATION
AND
YOU
MISTAKENLY
THOUGHT
I
WAS
INSULTING
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
INSULT
YOU
BUT
I
AM
NOT
THAT
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT
PAIN
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
TIME
TO
DEAL
WITH
THAT
HE
THEN
TOLD
ME
TO
CALL
HIM
THE
NEXT
DAY
FOR
FURTHER
INSTRUCTIONS
ON
HOW
DO
DEAL
WITH
MY
PAIN
AND
MEDICATION
I
AM
STILL
UPSET
AND
HAVE
NOT
YET
CALLED
MY
QUESTIONS
SHOULD
I
CONTINUE
TO
HAVE
THIS
DOCTOR
MANAGE
MY
CARE
SINCE
I
AM
IN
PAIN
OFF
AND
ON
I
REALIZE
THAT
THIS
MAY
CAUSE
ME
TO
BE
MORE
ANXIETOUS
SO
AM
I
PERHAPS
OVERREACTING
OR
OVERLY
SENSITIVE
IF
THIS
DOCTOR
REFERS
ME
TO
HIS
COLLEAGUE
WHO
KNOWS
MORE
ABOUT
THE
TYPE
OF
PAIN
I
HAVE
HE
STILL
WANTS
ME
TO
STATUS
HIM
ON
MY
CONDITION
BUT
NOW
I
AM
AFRAID
TO
CALL
HIM
MARLENA
