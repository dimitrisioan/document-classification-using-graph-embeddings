EXPERTS

THERE
THE
DOCTOR
THINKS
A
FRIEND
MIGHT
HAVE
THIS
THE
QUESTION
IS
DOESNT
THE
TICK
HAVE
TO
BITE
YOU
YOU
FREQUENTLY
FIND
A
TICK
CRAWLING
ON
YOU
AFTER
A
WALK
IN
THE
WOODS
AROUND
HERE
BUT
YOU
TEND
TO
NOTICE
IT
BEFORE
IT
BITES
YOU
PULLING
ONE
OUT
OF
YOUR
SKIN
IS
SOMETHING
YOURE
NOT
LIKELY
TO
FORGET
CAN
YOU
GET
THE
FEVER
WITHOUT
IT
BITING
YOU
DO
THEY
SOMETIMES
BITE
YOU
AND
THEN
LET
GO
SO
YOU
DONT
REALIZE

WERE
BITTEN
I

THEY
WILL
LET
GO

THEYVE
HAD
THEIR
FILL
BUT
YOU

SO
HOW
DO
YOU
GET
THE
FEVER
IF
YOU
NEVER
PULLED
A
TICK
OFF
YOURSELF
AS
OPPOSED
TO
FINDING
ONE
MERELY
CRAWLING
ON
YOU
