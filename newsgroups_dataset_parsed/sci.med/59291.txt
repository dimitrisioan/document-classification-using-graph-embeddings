RE
LOCALIZED
FAT
REDUCTION
DUE
TO
EXERCISE

WRITES
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
IF
EXERCISES
SPECIFIC
TO
PARTICULAR
REGIONS
OF
THE
BODY
SUCH
AS
THIGHS
WILL
BASICALLY
ONLY
TONE
THE
THIGHS
OR
IF
FAT
FROM
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
BODY
SUCH
AS
BREASTS
WOULD
BE
AFFECTED
JUST
AS
MUCH
THERE
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
MECHANISMS
HERE
TONING
OF
MUSCLES
AND
REDUCTION
OF
FAT
EXERCISES
SPECIFIC
TO
PARTICULAR
MUSCLES
WILL
TONE
ONLY
THOSE
MUSCLES
EXERCISED
EXAMPLE
LOOK
AT
DIFFERENCES
IN
ARM
CIRCUMFERENCES
BETWEEN
PITCHING
ARMS
AND
NONPITCHING
ARMS
IN
MAJOR
LEAGUE
PITCHERS
HOWEVER
IF
EXERCISE
ALSO
LEADS
TO
REDUCTION
OF
BODY
FAT
THE
LOSS
OF
BODY
FAT
WILL
BE
EQUALLY
DISTRIBUTED
OVER
THE
ENTIRE
BODY
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
SPOT
REDUCE
BODY
FAT
OTHER
THAN
SURGICALLY
THROUGH
LIPOSUCTION
DISTRIBUTION
OF
BODY
FAT
IS
GENETICALLY
DETERMINED
SOMETIMES
A
VERY
FLABBY
MUSCLE
WILL
LOOK
LIKE
FAT
SO
WHEN
THAT
MUSCLE
GAINS
SOME
MUSCLE
TONE
IT
MAY
APPEAR
AS
THOUGH
THE
FAT
IS
CHANGING
INTO
MUSCLE
BUT
REALLY
FAT
AND
MUSCLE
TISSUES
ARE
TOTALLY
SEPARATE
AND
ONE
DOES
NOT
EVER
CHANGE
INTO
THE
OTHER
