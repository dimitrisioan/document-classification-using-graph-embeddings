FLIGHTS
OF
FANCY
AND
OTHER
IRRATIONAL
APPROACHES
ARE
COMMON
THE
CRUCIAL
THING
IS
NOT
TO
SIT
AROUND
JUST
HAVING
FANTASIES
THEY
ARENT
OF
ANY
USE
UNLESS
THEY
MAKE
YOU
DO
SOME
EXPERIMENTS
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
WARREN
JELINEK
NOTICED
AN
EXTREMELY
HEAVY
BAND
ON
A
DNA
ELECTROPHORESIS
GEL
OF
HUMAN
ALU
FRAGMENTS
HE
GOT
VERY
EXCITED
BUT
WHY
DO
YOU
CHARACTERIZE
THIS
AS
A
FLIGHT
OF
FANCY
OR
A
FANTASY
WHILE
I
AM
UNFAMILIAR
WITH
THE
SCIENTIFIC
CONTEXT
HERE
IT
APPEARS
OBVIOUS
THAT
HIS
SPECULATION
FOR
LACK
OF
A
BETTER
OR
MORE
NEUTRAL
WORD
WAS
AT
LEAST
IN
SIGNIFICANT
PART
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
AND
ACCEPTANCE
OF
CURRENT
THEORY
COUPLED
WITH
HIS
OBSERVATIONS
IT
WOULD
APPEAR
THAT
SOMETHING
QUITE
RATIONAL
WAS
GOING
ON
AS
HE
ATTEMPTED
TO
FIT
HIS
OBSERVATION
INTO
THAT
THEORY
OR
TO
TAILOR
THE
THEORY
TO
COVER
THE
OBSERVATION
WHETHER
A
SCIENTIFIC
IDEA
COMES
WHILE
ONE
IS
STARING
OUT
THE
WINDOW
OR
DREAMING
OR
HAVING
A
FANTASY
OR
WATCHING
AN
APPLE
FALL
NEWTON
OR
SITTING
IN
A
BATH
ARCHIMEDES
IT
IS
ULTIMATELY
THE
RESULT
OF
A
LOT
OF
INTENSE
SCIENTIFIC
THINKING
DONE
BEFOREHAND
LETTING
ONES
MIND
ROAM
FREELY
AND
GIVING
REIN
TO
ONES
INTUITION
CAN
BE
A
USEFUL
WAY
OF
COMING
UP
WITH
NEW
IDEAS
BUT
ONLY
WHEN
ONE
HAS
DONE
A
LOT
OF
RATIONAL
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
PROBLEM
FIRST
SCIENTIFIC
INTUITION
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
ONE
IS
BORN
WITH
IT
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
ONE
LEARNS
MAYBE
WE
DONT
UNDERSTAND
COMPLETELY
HOW
IT
IS
LEARNED
BUT
TRAINING
IN
SYSTEMATIC
SCIENTIFIC
THINKING
IS
CERTAINLY
ONE
OF
THE
KEY
ELEMENTS
IN
DEVELOPING
IT
INFORMAL
EXPLORATION
IS
ALSO
OFTEN
AN
IMPORTANT
ELEMENT
IN
FINDING
NEW
SCIENTIFIC
IDEAS
ONE
THINKS
FOR
INSTANCE
OF
DARWINS
NATURALISTIC
STUDIES
IN
THE
GALAPAGOS
ISLANDS
WHICH
LED
HIM
TO
THE
IDEAS
FOR
THE
THEORY
OF
EVOLUTION
THIS
IS
WHY
I
AM
OFFENDED
BY
A
DEFINITION
OF
SCIENCE
THAT
EMPHASIZES
EMPIRICAL
VERIFICATION
AND
DOES
NOT
RECOGNIZE
THINKING
AND
INFORMAL
EXPLORATION
AS
IMPORTANT
SCIENTIFIC
WORK
I
AGREE
THAT
MERE
SPECULATION
DOES
NOT
DESERVE
TO
BE
CALLED
SCIENCE
I
ALSO
THINK
THAT
MERE
EMPIRICAL
STUDIES
NOT
DIRECTED
BY
GOOD
SCIENTIFIC
THINKING
ARE
AT
BEST
A
VERY
POOR
KIND
