IS
THERE
A
RIGHTEYE
DOMINANCE
EYEDNESS
AS
THERE
IS
AN
OVERALL
RIGHTHANDEDNESS
IN
THE
POPULATION
I
MEAN
DO
MOST
PEOPLE
REQUIRE
LESS
LENS
CORRECTIONS
FOR
THE
ONE
EYE
THAN
THE
OTHER
IF
SO
WHAT
KINDS
OF
PERCENTAGES
CAN
BE
ATTACHED
TO
THIS
THANKS
YES
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
EYE
DOMINANCE
ALTHOUGH
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
DOMINANCE
REFERS
TO
PERSCRIPTION
STRENGTH
AS
I
RECALL
IF
YOU
SELECTIVELY
CLOSE
YOUR
DOMINANT
EYE
YOU
WILL
PERCIEVE
THAT
THE
IMAGE
SHIFTS
THIS
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
IF
YOU
CLOSE
YOUR
OTHER
EYE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WHICH
EYE
IS
DOMINANT
IS
RELATED
TO
HANDEDNESS
BUT
I
CANT
RECALL
THE
RELATION
AT
THE
MOMENT
BARRY

BENOWITZ
I
READ
A
GREAT
BOOK
ABOUT
EYE
DOMINANCE
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
SO
THERE
IS
ONE
BOOK
OUT
THEREAT
LEAST
ONE
THERE
WERE
SEVERAL
TYPES
OF
EYE
DOMINANCE
WHERE
A
PERSON
LOOKS
IN
THEIR
MEMORY
USUALLY
INDICATES
A
TYPE
OF
EYE
DOMINANC
ANOTHER
TYPE
IS
RELATED
TO
COORDINATION
ACTIVITIES
LIKE
HITTING
A
BALL
ANOTHER
FOR
READING
I
DIDNT
READ
ONE
THAT
DISCUSSED
PRESCRIPTION
STRENGTH
ALTHOUGH
PEOPLE
WITH
BAD
VISION
NEAR
OR
FAR
SIGHTED
WOULD
TEND
TO
DEPEND
ON
THE
STRONGER
EYE
