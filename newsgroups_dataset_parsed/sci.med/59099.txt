CORNEAL
EROSIONABRASIONS
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
I
HAVE
BEEN
DEALING
WITH
RECCURRING
CORNEAL
EROSION
THERE
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
BE
MUCH
KNOWN
ABOUT
THE
CAUSE
OF
SUCH
A
PROBLEM
MY
CURRENT
EPISODE
IS
PRETTY
BAD
SINCE
IT
IS
LOCATED
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
CORNEA
IF
ITS
BAD
ENOUGH
THE
USUAL
TREATMENT
FOR
IT
IS
PUNCTURE
THERAPY
HOWEVER
MY
DOCTOR
THIS
TIME
IS
TRYING
TO
LET
IT
HEAL
BY
ITSELF
BY
PUTTING
A
CONTACT
LENS
TO
PROTECT
THE
AREA
APPARENTLY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
THAT
COMMON
BUT
ID
BE
CURIOUS
IF
ANYONE
ELSE
OUT
THERE
HAS
A
SIMILAR
PROBLEM
PERHAPS
TO
SEE
IF
A
CAUSE
CAN
BE
FOUND
