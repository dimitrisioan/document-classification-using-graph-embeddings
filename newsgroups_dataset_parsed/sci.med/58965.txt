MARK
ROBERT
THORSON
WRITES
THIS
REMINDS
ME
OF
THE
LAST
GRAHAM
KERR
COOKING
SHOW
I
SAW
TODAY
HE
SMOKED
MEAT
ON
THE
STOVETOP
IN
A
BIG
POT
HE
USED
A
STRANGE
TECHNIQUE
ID
NEVER
SEEN
BEFORE
HE
TOOK
A
BIG
POT
WITH
LID
AND
PLACED
A
TRAY
IN
IT
MADE
FROM
ALUMINUM
FOIL
THE
TRAY
WAS
ABOUT
THE
SIZE
AND
SHAPE
OF
A
TYPICAL
COFFEETABLE
ASH
TRAY
MADE
BY
CRUMPLING
A
SHEET
OF
FOIL
AROUND
THE
EDGES
IN
THE
TRAY
HE
PLACED
A
COUPLE
SPOONFULS
OF
BROWN
SUGAR
A
SIMILAR
QUANTITY
OF
BROWN
RICE
HE
SAID
ANY
RICE
WILL
DO
THE
CONTENTS
OF
TWO
TEABAGS
OF
EARL
GREY
TEA
AND
A
FEW
CLOVES
ON
TOP
OF
THIS
WAS
PLACED
AN
ORDINARY
ALUMINUM
BASKETTYPE
STEAMER
WITH
TWO
CHICKEN
BREASTS
IN
IT
THE
LID
WAS
PUT
ON
AND
THE
WHOLE
ASSEMBLY
WENT
ON
THE
STOVETOP
AT
HIGH
HEAT
FOR
OR
MINUTES
LATER
HE
REMOVED
WHAT
LOOKED
LIKE
SMOKED
CHICKEN
BREASTS
WHAT
SURPRISES
AND
CONCERNS
ME
ARE
NO
WOOD
CHIPS
WHERE
DOES
THE
SMOKE
FLAVOR
COME
FROM
ABOUT
OR
YEARS
AGO
I
REMEMBER
HEARING
THAT
CARMEL
COLOR
OBTAINED
BY
CARAMELIZING
SUGAR
A
COMMON
COLORING
AND
FLAVORING
AGENT
HAD
BEEN
FOUND
TO
BE
CARCINOGENIC
I
BELIEVE
THEY
INJECTED
IT
UNDER
THE
SKIN
OF
RATS
OR
SOMETHING
IF
THE
RESULTS
WERE
CONCLUSIVE
CARAMEL
COLOR
WOULD
NOT
BE
LEGAL
IN
THE
US
YET
IT
IS
STILL
BEING
USED
WAS
THE
INITIAL
RESEARCH
RESULT
FOUND
TO
BE
INCORRECT
OR
WHAT
ABOUT
OR
YEARS
AGO
I
REMEMBER
EARL
GREY
TEA
BEING
IMPLICATED
AS
CARCINOGENIC
BECAUSE
IT
CONTAINS
OIL
OF
BERGAMOT
AN
EXTRACT
FROM
THE
SKIN
OF
A
TYPE
OF
CITRUS
FRUIT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHATEVER
HAPPENED
WITH
THAT
STORY
IF
IT
WERE
CARCINOGENIC
EARL
GREY
TEA
COULD
NOT
HAVE
IT
AS
AN
ADDITIVE
YET
IT
APPARENTLY
CONTINUES
TO
DO
SO
WRT
NATURAL
WOOD
SMOKE
IVE
SMOKING
A
DUCK
RIGHT
NOW
AS
IT
HAPPENS
IVE
NOTICED
THAT
A
HEAVILYSMOKED
FOOD
ITEM
WILL
HAVE
AN
UNPLEASANT
TANGY
TASTE
WHEN
EATEN
DIRECTLY
OUT
OF
THE
SMOKER
IF
THE
SMOKE
HAS
ONLY
RECENTLY
STOPPED
FLOWING
I
FIND
THE
BEST
TASTE
TO
BE
HAD
BY
USING
DRY
WOOD
CHIPS
GETTING
LOTS
OF
SMOKE
RIGHT
UP
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
COOKING
PROCESS
THEN
SLOWLY
BARBEQUING
FOR
HOURS
AND
HOURS
WITHOUT
ADDING
ADDITIONAL
WOOD
CHIPS
MY
THEORY
IS
THAT
THE
UNPLEASANT
TANGY
MOLECULES
ARE
LOWMOLECULAR
WEIGHT
STUFF
LIKE
TERPENES
AND
THAT
THE
SMOKY
FLAVOR
MOLECULES
ARE
SOME
SORT
OF
LARGER
MOLECULE
MORE
SIMILAR
TO
TAR
THE
LONG
BARBEQUE
TIME
AFTER
THE
INITIAL
INTENSIVE
SMOKE
DRIVES
OFF
THE
LOWMOLECULAR
WEIGHT
STUFF
JUST
LEAVING
THE
FLAVOR
BEHIND
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
MY
THEORY
IS
CORRECT
I
ALSO
REMEMBER
HEARING
THAT
THE
COMBUSTION
PRODUCTS
OF
FAT
DRIPPING
ON
THE
CHARCOAL
AND
BURNING
ARE
CARCINOGENIC
FOR
THAT
REASON
AND
BECAUSE
IT
COVERS
THE
PRODUCT
WITH
SOOT
AND
SOME
UNPLEASANT
TANGINESS
I
ONLY
GRILL
NONDRIPPY
MEATS
LIKE
PRAWNS
DIRECTLY
OVER
HOT
COALS
I
DO
STUFF
LIKE
THIS
DUCK
BY
INDIRECT
HEAT
I
HAVE
A
LONG
RECTANGULAR
WEBER
AND
I
PUT
THE
COALS
AT
ONE
END
AND
THE
MEAT
AT
THE
OTHER
END
THE
FAT
DROPS
DIRECTLY
ON
THE
FLOOR
BELOW
THE
MEAT
AND
NEXT
TIME
I
USE
THE
BARBEQUE
I
MAKE
THE
FIRE
IN
THAT
END
TO
BURN
OFF
THE
FAT
AND
HELP
IGNITE
THE
COALS
AND
YET
ANOTHER
REASON
IVE
HEARD
NOT
TO
SMOKE
OR
BARBEQUE
MEAT
IS
THAT
SMOKED
CURED
MEAT
LIKE
PORK
SAUSAGE
AND
BACON
CONTAINS
NITROSAMINES
WHICH
ARE
CARCINOGENIC
IM
PRETTY
SURE
THIS
CLAIM
ACTUALLY
HAS
SOME
STANDING
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
OTHERS
AN
AMUSING
INCIDENT
I
RECALL
WAS
THE
DUNCAN
HINES
SCANDAL
WHEN
IT
WAS
DISCOVERED
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
MAKE
DUNCAN
HINES
CAKE
MIX
WERE
PUTTING
A
LOT
OF
ETHYLENE
DIBROMIDE
EDB
INTO
THE
CAKE
MIX
TO
SUPPRESS
WEEVILS
THIS
IS
A
FUMIGANT
WHICH
IS
KNOWN
TO
BE
CARCINOGENIC
THE
GUY
WHO
REPRESENTED
THE
COMPANY
IN
THE
PRESS
CONFERENCE
DEFENDED
HIMSELF
BY
SAYING
THAT
THE
RISK
FROM
EATING
DUNCAN
HINES
PRODUCTS
EVERY
DAY
FOR
A
YEAR
WOULD
BE
EQUAL
TO
THE
CANCER
RISK
FROM
EATING
TWO
CHARCOAL
BROILED
STEAKS
WHAT
A
GREAT
ANALOGY
WHEN
I
FIRST
HEARD
THAT
MY
IMMEDIATE
REACTION
WAS
WE
SHOULD
MAKE
THAT
A
STANDARD
UNIT
ONE
CHARCOAL
BROILED
STEAK
WOULD
BE
EQUIVALENT
TO
DUNCANS
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
IS
FOUND
TO
BE
CARCINOGENIC
THAT
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
LEGAL
IN
THE
US
I
THINK
THAT
NATURALLY
OCCURING
SUBSTANCES
EXCLUDING
CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES
ARE
PRETTY
MUCH
UNREGULATED
IN
TERMS
OF
THEIR
USE
AS
FOOD
FOOD
ADDITIVES
OR
OTHER
CONSUMPTION
ITS
ONLY
WHEN
THE
CHEMISTS
CONCOCT
SP
AN
INGREDIENT
THAT
IT
FALLS
UNDER
FDA
REGULATIONS
OTHERWISE
IF
THEY
REALLY
LOOKED
CLOSELY
THEY
WOULD
FIND
A
REASON
TO
BAN
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
HOW
IN
THE
WORLD
DO
YOU
SUPPOSE
ITS
LEGAL
TO
CONSUME
TOBACCO
PRODUCTS
WHICH
PROBABLY
SHOULD
BE
BANNED
