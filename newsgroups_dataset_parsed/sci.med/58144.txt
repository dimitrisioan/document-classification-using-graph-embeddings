have
an
acquaintance
who
has
been
diagnosed
as
having
blood
clots
and
compartment
syndrome
i
searched
the
latest
edition
of
the
columbia
medical
encyclopedia
and
found
nothing
mosbys
medical
dictionary
gives
a
very
brief
description
which
suggests
its
an
arterial
condition
can
someone
point
me
an
compartment
syndrome
occurs
when
swelling
happens
in
a
compartment
bounded
by
fascia
the
pressure
rises
in
the
compartment
and
blood
supply
and
nerves
are
compromised
the
treatment
is
to
open
the
compartment
surgically
the
most
common
places
for
compartment
syndromes
are
the
forearm
and
calf
it
is
an
emergency
since
if
the
pressure
is
not
relieved
stuff
will
die
