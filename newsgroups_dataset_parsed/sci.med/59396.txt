DEFINITELY
INTENDED
HERE
BILL
WAS
MAKING
FUN
OF
THE
MISSPELLING
GO
LOOK
UP
THE
WORD
KRILL
ALSO
THE
CORRECT
SPELLING
IS
KIRLIAN
IT
INVOLVES
TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
CORONA
DISCHARGES
CREATED
BY
ATTACHING
THE
SUBJECT
TO
A
HIGHVOLTAGE
SOURCE
NOT
OF
SOME
AURA
IT
WORKS
EQUALLY
WELL
WITH
INANIMATE
OBJECTS
TRUE
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
SHOWING
THE
MISSING
PART
OF
A
LEAF
IS
THIS
CORONA
DISCHARGE
YUP
THE
DEMONSTRATION
TO
WHICH
YOU
REFER
CONSISTS
OF
PLACING
A
LEAF
BETWEEN
THE
PLATES
AND
TAKING
A
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPH
OF
IT
YOU
THEN
CUT
OFF
PART
OF
THE
LEAF
PUT
THE
TOP
PLATE
BACK
ON
AND
TAKE
ANOTHER
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPH
YOU
SEE
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
IMAGE
IN
BOTH
CASES
TURNS
OUT
THE
EFFECT
ISNT
NEARLY
SO
STRIKING
IF
YOU
TAKE
THE
TROUBLE
TO
CLEAN
THE
PLATES
BETWEEN
PHOTOGRAPHS
SEEMS
THAT
THE
MOISTURE
FROM
THE
LEAF
THAT
YOU
LEFT
ON
THE
PLACE
CONDUCTS
ELECTRICITY
SURPRISE
SURPRISE
THIS
IS
TRUE
BUT
ITS
NOT
QUITE
THE
WHOLE
STORY
THERE
WERE
ACTUALLY
SOME
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
MORE
CAREFUL
IN
THEIR
METHODOLOGY
WHO
ALSO
REPLICATED
THE
PHANTOM
LEAF
EFFECT
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
CRITICS
OF
KIRLIAN
ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHY
IS
A
THEOSOPHIST
AND
THREFORE
PRESUMABLY
WILLING
TO
ENTERTAIN
THE
HYPOTHESIS
OF
SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE
FOR
A
HUMAN
AURA
ELECTROMAGNETIC
OR
OTHERWISE
PROFESSOR
OF
ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING
AT
LONDONS
CITY
UNIVERSITY
AND
A
PAST
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
SOCIETY
FOR
PSYCHIC
RESEARCH
NAMED
A
J
ELLISON
AFTER
YEARS
OF
STUDYING
THE
METHOD
AND
THE
CLAIMS
ELLISON
CAME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
PHOTOGRAPHIC
IMAGES
ARE
WHAT
WE
CALLS
LICHTENBERG
FIGURES
AN
EFFECT
OF
INTERMITTENT
IONIZATION
OF
THE
AIR
AROUND
THE
OBJECT
ITS
A
BIT
MORE
COMPLICATED
THAN
NOT
WIPING
OFF
THE
PLATES
BUT
IT
COMES
DOWN
TO
THE
SAME
THING
IN
THE
END
KIRLIAN
ELECTROPHOTOGRAPHY
HAS
MUCH
MORE
LIMITED
VALUE
IF
ANY
THAN
WAS
PREVIOUSLY
WIDELY
THOUGHT
ELECTRICAL
AND
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
GENERATED
BY
THE
BODY
ARE
MUCH
TOO
SMALL
TO
BE
OF
MUCH
USE
DIAGNOSTICALLY
WITHOUT
VERY
ELABORATE
EQUIPMENT

USUALLY
