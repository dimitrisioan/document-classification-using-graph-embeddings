WRITES
I
LIVE
AT
SEALEVEL
AND
AM
CALLEDUPON
TO
TRAVEL
TO
HIGHALTITUDE
CITIES
QUITE
FREQUENTLY
ON
BUSINESS
THE
CITIES
IN
QUESTION
ARE
AT
TO
FEET
OF
ALTITUDE
ONE
OF
THEM
ESPECIALLY
IS
VERY
POLLUTED
MEXICO
CITY
BOGOTA
LA
PAZ
OFTEN
I
FEEL
FAINT
THE
FIRST
TWO
OR
THREE
DAYS
I
FEEL
LIGHTHEADED
AND
MY
HEART
SEEMS
TO
POUND
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
AT
SEALEVEL
ALSO
IT
IS
VERY
DRY
IN
THESE
CITIES
SO
I
WILL
TEND
TO
DRINK
A
LOT
OF
WATER
AND
KEEP
AWAY
FROM
DEHYDRATING
DRINKS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
CONTAINING
CAFFEINE
OR
ALCOHOL
THING
IS
I
STILL
HAVE
SYMPTOMS
HOW
CAN
I
ENSURE
THAT
MY
SHORT
TRIPS
THERE
NO
I
DONT
USUALLY
HAVE
A
WEEK
TO
ACCLIMATIZE
ARE
AS
COMFORTABLE
AS
POSSIBLE
IS
THERE
SOMETHING
ELSE
THAT
I
COULD
DO
AN
UNCONVENTIONAL
REMEDY
THAT
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
FOR
ALTITUDE
SICKNESS
IN
THE
ANDES
IS
CHEWING
COCA
LEAVES
OR
TAKING
TEAS
MADE
FROM
COCA
LEAVES
YOU
MIGHT
NOTICE
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
NATIVES
HAVE
WADS
IN
THEIR
MOUTHS
THE
TEA
CAN
BE
OBTAINED
IN
S
AMERICAN
PHARMACIES
THIS
REMEDY
ALLEVIATES
SOME
OF
THE
LIGHTHEADEDNESS
AND
DIZZINESS
BUT
DONT
TRY
TO
JOG
WITH
IT
IVE
TRIED
THIS
WHEN
TRAVELLING
AND
HIKING
IN
PERU
AND
ECUADOR
THE
AMOUNT
OF
COCAINE
YOU
WOULD
INGEST
ARE
TOO
MINUTE
TO
CAUSE
ANY
HIGHS
ALSO
IT
IS
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
EAT
LIGHTLY
AND
DRESS
WARM
WHILE
ADJUSTING
TO
HIGH
ALTITUDES
