ELISHA
WIESEL
WRITES
RECENTLY
IVE
COME
UPON
A
BODY
OF
LITERATURE
WHICH
PROMOTES
COLON
CLEANSING
AS
A
VITAL
AID
TO
PREVENTIVE
MEDICINE
THROUGH
NUTRITION
NO
DOUBT
THE
SCIMED
FOLKS
ARE
GETTING
OUT
THEIR
FLAMETHROWERS
IM
RATHER
CERTAIN
THAT
THE
INFORMATION
YOU
GOT
WAS
NOT
MEDICAL
LITERATURE
IN
THE
ACCEPTED
ACADEMICSCIENTIFIC
JOURNALS
SO
THE
RIGHTEOUS
AMONG
THEM
WILL
NO
DOUBT
JUMP
ON
THAT
ALSO
INSOFAR
AS
IT
DOESNT
CONFORM
TO
THE
ACCEPTED
MEDICAL
PRESUMPTION
THAT
IT
JUST
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
YOU
EAT
AND
THAT
WE
CAN
THINK
OF
THE
GI
TRACT
AS
A
BLACK
BOX
IN
WHICH
NOTHING
EVER
GOES
WRONG
EXCEPT
FOR
MAYBE
CANCER
AND
ULCERS
THE
RIGHTEOUS
WILL
NO
DOUBT
JUMP
ON
THAT
TOO
THEN
THERELL
BE
THE
ONES
WHO
CALL
YOUR
DOCTOR
A
RAVING
QUACK
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
LIKE
LINUS
PAULING
IS
LUCID
AND
ROBUST
WELL
INTO
HIS
NINETIESBUT
NEVERMIND
ABOUT
THAT
HE
SHOULDNT
CHARGE
FOR
HIS
EQUIPMENT
AND
SUPPLIES
SINCE
THEYRE
NO
DOUBT
NOT
APPROVED
BY
THE
FDA
OF
COURSE
WITH
FDA
APPROVAL
AN
MD
OR
PHARMACEUTICAL
COMPANY
CAN
CHARGE
WHATEVER
THEY
CAN
GET
FOR
SUCH
SAFE
AND
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENTS
AS
THALIDOMIDE
BUT
NEVERMIND
ABOUT
THAT
EITHER
UNFORTUNATELY
YOU
DARED
TO
STEP
INTO
THE
SACRED
TURF
OF
NETMEDICAL
DISCUSSION
WITHOUT
A
CREDENTIAL
AND
WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
RIGHTEOUS
AMONG
THEM
WILL
MAKE
CERTAIN
THAT
YOU
ARE
SUITABLY
DENOUNCED
BEFORE
DISMISSING
YOU
AS
A
FOOL
BUT
MAYBE
SOMEBODY
WITHOUT
SUCH
A
HUGE
CHIP
ON
THEIR
SHOULDER
WILL
SEND
YOU
SOME
REASONABLE
RESPONSES
BY
EMAIL
OH
YES
I
DID
HAVE
A
POINT
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
AN
MD
WITH
A
THRIVING
PRACTICE
IN
A
VERY
WEALTHY
PART
OF
SILICON
VALLEY
ONCE
RECOMMENDED
THAT
I
TAKE
SUCH
TREATMENTS
TO
CLEAR
UP
A
SKIN
CONDITION
NOT
THROUGH
HIS
OFFICE
I
MIGHT
ADD
ALTHOUGH
IM
SURE
THATS
NOT
CONCLUSIVE
IT
WAS
SURE
AN
UNUSUAL
PRESCRIPTION
