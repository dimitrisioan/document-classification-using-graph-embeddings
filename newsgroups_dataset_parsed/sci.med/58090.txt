THIS
IS
REGARDING
RECURRENT
VOLVULUS
WHICH
OUR
LITTLE
BOY
HAS
BEEN
SUFFERING
FROM
EVER
SINCE
HE
WAS
AN
INFANT
HE
HAD
A
SURGERY
WHEN
HE
WAS
ONE
YEAR
OLD
ANOTHER
SURGERY
HAD
TO
BE
PERFORMED
ONE
YEAR
AFTER
WHEN
HE
WAS
TWO
YEARS
OLD
HE
TURNED
THREE
THIS
FEBRUARY
AND
HE
IS
STILL
GETTING
AFFLICTED
BY
THIS
ILLNESS
LIKE
HAVING
TO
GET
HOSPITALISED
FOR
VOMITTING
AND
ACCOMPANYING
STOMACH
PAINHE
MANAGED
NOT
HAVING
A
THIRD
SURGERY
SO
FAR
ONE
THING
ME
AND
MY
WIFE
NOTICED
IS
THAT
HIS
AFFLICTION
PEAKS
AROUND
THE
TIME
HE
WAS
BORN
ON
NEARABOUTS
LIKE
IN
MARCH
EVERY
YEAR
ANY
SIGNIFICANCE
TO
THIS
WHY
DOES
THIS
RECUR
ME
AND
MY
FAMILY
GO
THROUGH
SEVERE
PAIN
WHEN
OUR
LITTLE
BOY
HAVE
TO
UNDERGO
SURGERY
WHY
DOES
SURGERY
NOT
RECTIFY
THE
SITUATION
ALSO
WHICH
HOSPITAL
IN
US
OR
CANADA
SPECIALIZE
IN
THIS
MALADY
WHAT
WILL
BE
A
GOOD
BOOK
EXPLAINING
THIS
DISEASE
IN
DETAIL
WILL
KEEPING
A
PARTICULAR
DIET
KEEP
DOWN
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
RECURRENCE
AS
TIME
GOES
ON
WILL
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
RECURRENCE
GO
DOWN
CONSIDERING
HE
IS
GETTING
STRONGER
AND
HEALTHIER
AND
PROBABLY
LESS
PRONE
TO
ATTACKS
OR
IS
THIS
ASSUMPTION
WRONG
ANY
HELP
THROWING
LIGHT
ON
THESE
QUERIES
WILL
BE
HIGHLY
APPRECIATED
