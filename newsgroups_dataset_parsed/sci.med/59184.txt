WHO
HAVE
BEEN

CAUSES
DESCRIBABLE
REPORTABLE
DOCUMENTABLE

SHOULD
BE
PRETTY
SIMPLE
TO

I
TEND
TO
DISAGREE
I
THINK
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
PROVIDED
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
IT
AND
IT
IS
FAIRLY
CONSISTENT
WILL
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
FIRST
IT
POINTS
TO
THE
NECESSITY
OF
DOING
A
STUDY
AND
SECOND
IT
AT

SAYS
THAT
THE
EFFECTS
ARE
ALL
PSYCHOLOGICAL
OR
POSSIBLY
ALLERGY
IN

AS

THE

CANNOT

TO
ANOTHER

THERE
IS

THAT

THAT
WAS
A

BUT
HOPEFULLY
I
MADE
MY

ITS
ALL
A
MATTER
OF
PERCEPTION
AND
AS
LONG
AS
SOMEONE
INGESTING
MSG
PERCEIVES
IT
AS
CAUSING
BAD
EFFECTS
THEN
SHE
CAN
DEFINITELY
EXPERIENCE
THOSE
AFFECTS
ON

IT
COULD

ANECDOTAL
