IN

ALTHOUGH
THEYRE
NOT

THE
PROBLEM
WHY
DOES
OCCUPATIONAL
OVERUSE
SYNDROME
OCCUR
HERES
THE
THEORY
NORMALLY
YOUR
MUSCLES
AND

GET
BLOOD
THROUGH
CAPILLARIES
WHICH
PASS
AMONG
THE
MUSCLE
FIBERS
WHEN
YOU
TENSE
A
MUSCLE
YOU
RESTRICT
THE
BLOOD
FLOW
BY
THE
TIME
YOURE
EXERTING
OF
YOUR
FULL
POWER
YOURE
COMPLETELY
RESTRICTING
YOUR
BLOOD
FLOW
WITHOUT
FRESH
BLOOD
YOUR
MUSCLES
USE
STORED
ENERGY
UNTIL
THEY
RUN
OUT
THEN
THEY
SWITCH
TO
ANAEROBIC
WITHOUT
OXYGEN
METABOLISM
WHICH
GENERATES

TENSE
UP
PERHAPS
TO
RELIEVE
THE
LOAD
THIS
MAKES
SENSE
FOR
YOUR
NORMAL
SORT
OF
INJURY
BUT
IT
ONLY
MAKES
THINGS
WORSE
WITH
REPETITIVE
MOTION
MORE
TENSION
MEANS
LESS
BLOOD
FLOW
AND
THE
CYCLE
CONTINUES
ANOTHER
BYPRODUCT
OF
THE
LACK
OF
BLOOD
FLOW
IS
TINGLING
AND
NUMBNESS
FROM
YOUR
NERVES
THEY
NEED
BLOOD
TOO
ANYWAY
WHEN
YOURE
TYPING
TOO
MUCH
YOURE
NEVER
REALLY
GIVING
A
CHANGE
FOR
THE
BLOOD
TO
GET
BACK
WHERE
IT
BELONGS
BECAUSE
YOUR
MUSCLES
NEVER
RELAX
ENOUGH
TO
LET
THE
BLOOD
THROUGH
STRESS
POOR
POSTURE
AND
POOR
ERGONOMICS
ONLY
MAKE
THINGS
WORSE
SPECIFIC
INJURIES
YOU
MAY
HAVE
HEARD
OF
NOTE
MOST
INJURIES
COME
IN
TWO
FLAVORS
ACUTE
AND
CHRONIC
ACUTE
INJURIES
ARE
SEVERELY
PAINFUL
AND
NOTICABLE
CHRONIC
CONDITIONS
HAVE
LESS
PRONOUNCED
SYMPTOMS
BUT
ARE
EVERY
BIT
AS
REAL
TENOSYNOVITIS
AN
INFLAMATION
OF
THE
TENDON
SHEATH
CHRONIC
TENOSYNOVITIS
OCCURS
WHEN
THE
REPETITIVE
ACTIVITY
IS
MILD
OR
INTERMITTENT
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
CAUSE
ACUTE
INFLAMATION
BUT
ENOUGH
TO
EXCEED
THE
TENDON
SHEATHS
ABILITY
TO
LUBRICATE
THE
TENDON
AS
A
RESULT
THE
TENDON
SHEATH
THICKENS
GETS
INFLAMED
AND
YOUVE
GOT
YOUR
PROBLEM
TENDONITIS
AN
INFLAMMATION
OF
A
TENDON
REPEATED
TENSING
OF
A
TENDON
CAN
CAUSE
INFLAMATION
EVENTUALLY
THE
FIBERS
OF
THE
TENDON
START
SEPARATING
AND
CAN
EVEN
BREAK
LEAVING
BEHIND

WHICH
INDUCES

ENTAILS

CARPAL

SYNDROME
THE
NERVES
THAT

TENSION
ALSO
KNOWN
AS
NEURAL

THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
NERVES
RUNNING

AND
POSSIBLY
COMPRESSED
AS
A
RESULT
OF

ABOUT
EVERY

THERES
A
FANCY
NAME
FOR
A
WAY
TO
INJURE
IT
BY
NOW
YOU
SHOULD
BE

AN
IDEA
OF
HOW
OOS
CONDITIONS
OCCUR
AND
WHY
JUST
BE
CAREFUL
MANY
INEXPERIENCED
DOCTORS
MISDIAGNOSE
PROBLEMS
AS
CARPAL
TUNNEL
SYNDROME
WHEN
IN
REALITY
YOU
MAY
HAVE
A
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
PROBLEM
ALWAYS
GET
A
SECOND
OPINION
BEFORE
SOMEBODY
DOES
SOMETHING
DRASTIC
TO
YOU
LIKE
SURGERY
TYPING
POSTURE
ERGONOMICS
PREVENTION
TREATMENT
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
ELEMENT
OF
BOTH
PREVENTION
AND
RECOVERY
IS
TO
REDUCE
TENSION
IN
THE
MUSCLES
AND
TENDONS
THIS
REQUIRES
LEARNING
HOW
TO
RELAX
IF
YOURE
UNDER
A
LOAD
OF
STRESS
THIS
IS
DOUBLY
IMPORTANT
TUNE
OUT
THE
WORLD
AND
BREATH
DEEP
AND
REGULAR
RELAXING
SHOULD
BECOME
A
GUIDING
PRINCIPLE
IN
YOUR
WORK
EVERY
THREE
MINUTES
TAKE
A
THREE
SECOND
BREAK
EVERY
THREE
MINUTES
TAKE
A
THREE
SECOND
BREAK
REALLY
DO
IT
EVERY
THREE
MINUTES
ITS
ALSO
HELPFUL
TO
WORK
IN
COMFORTABLE
SURROUNDINGS
CALM
DOWN
AND
RELAX
IF
YOU
CANT
SLEEP
YOU
REALLY
NEED
TO
FOCUS
ON
THIS
REST
SLEEP
AND
RELAXATION
ARE
REALLY
A
BIG
DEAL
THERE
ARE
ALL
KINDS
OF
OTHER
TREATMENTS
OF
COURSE
DRUGS
CAN
REDUCE
INFLAMATION
AND
PAIN
CUSTOMMOLDED
SPLINTS
CAN
FORCEFULLY
PREVENT
BAD
POSTURE
SURGERY
CAN
FIX
SOME
PROBLEMS
EXERCISE
CAN
HELP
STRENGTHEN
YOUR
MUSCLES
REGULAR
STRETCHING
CAN
HELP
PREVENT
INJURY
GOOD
POSTURE
AND
A
GOOD
ERGONOMIC
WORKSPACE
PROMOTE
REDUCED
TENSION
ICE
OR

CONTRAST
BATHS
ALSO
REDUCE

ONLY
YOUR
DOCTOR
CAN
SAY
WHATS
BEST
FOR
YOU
POSTURE
HERE
ARE
SOME
BASIC
GUIDELINES
I
SO
LIKED
THE
WAY
THIS
WAS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
NEW
ZEALAND
BOOK
THAT
IM
LIFTING
IT
ALMOST
VERBATIM
FROM
APPENDIX
DWALLACH
LET
YOUR
SHOULDERS
RELAX
LET
YOUR
ELBOWS
SWING
FREE
KEEP
YOUR
WRISTS
STRAIGHT
PULL
YOUR
CHIN
IN
TO
LOOK
DOWN
DONT
FLOP
YOUR
HEAD
FORWARD
KEEP
THE
HOLLOW
IN
THE
BASE
OF
YOUR
SPINE
TRY
LEANING
BACK
IN
THE
CHAIR
DONT
SLOUCH
OR
SLUMP
FORWARD
ALTER
YOUR
POSTURE
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
EVERY
MINUTES
GET
UP
AND
BEND
YOUR
SPINE
BACKWARD
SET
THE
SEAT
HEIGHT
FIRST
YOUR
FEET
SHOULD
BE
FLAT
ON
THE
FLOOR
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NO
UNDUE
PRESSURE
ON
THE
UNDERSIDE
OF
YOUR
THIGHS
NEAR
THE
KNEES
AND
YOUR
THIGHS
SHOULD
NOT
SLOPE
TOO
MUCH
NOW
DRAW
YOURSELF
UP
TO
YOUR
DESK
AND
SEE
THAT
ITS
HEIGHT
IS
COMFORTABLE
TO
WORK
AT
IF
YOU
ARE
SHORT
THIS
MAY
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
THE
BEEST
REMEDY
IS
TO
RAISE
THE
SEAT
HEIGHT
AND
PREVENT
YOUR
LEGS
FROM
DANGLING
BY
USING
A
FOOTREST
NOW
ADJUST
THE
BACKREST
HEIGHT
SO
THAT
YOUR
BUTTOCKS
FIT
INTO
THE
SPACE
BETWEEN
THE
BACKREST
AND
THE
SEAT
PAN
THE
BACKREST
SHOULD
SUPPORT
YOU
IN
THE
HOLLOW
OF
YOUR
BACK
SO
ADJUST
ITS
TILT
TO
GIVE
FIRM
SUPPORT
IN
THIS
AREA
IF
YOU
OPERATE
A
KEYBOARD
YOU
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
SPEND
MORE
TIME
LEANING
BACK
SO
EXPERIMENT
WITH
A
CHAIR
WITH
A
TALLER
BACKREST
IF
AVAILABLE
NOW
I
DIVERGE
A
LITTLE
FROM
THE
TEXT
A
GOOD
CHAIR
MAKES
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
IF
YOU
DONT
LIKE
YOUR
CHAIR
GO
FIND
A
BETTER
ONE
YOU
REALLY
WANT
ADJUSTMENTS
FOR
HEIGHT
BACK
ANGLE
BACK
HEIGHT
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
SEAT
TILT
MOST
ARM
RESTS
SEEM
TO
GET
IN
THE
WAY
ALTHOUGH
SOME
MORE
EXPENSIVE
CHAIRS
HAVE
HEIGHT
ADJUSTABLE
ARM
RESTS
WHICH
YOU
CAN
ALSO
ROTATE
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
YOU
SHOULD
FIND
A
GOOD
STORE
AND
PLAY
WITH
ALL
THESE
CHAIRS
PICK
ONE
THATS
RIGHT
FOR
YOU
IN
THE
SAN
FRANCISCO
BAY
AREA
I
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
JUST
CHAIRS
THE

SAYS
IT
ALL
KEYBOARD
DRAWERS
WRIST
PADS
AND

REPLACEMENTS
THERE
IS
A
FAIR
AMOUNT
OF
CONTROVERY
ON
HOW
TO
GET
THIS
RIGHT
FOR
SOME
PEOPLE
WRIST
PADS
SEEM
TO
WORK
WONDERS
HOWEVER
WITH
GOOD
POSTURE
YOU
SHOULDNT
BE
RESTING
YOUR
WRISTS
ON
ANYTHING
YOU
WOULD
PREFER
YOUR
KEYBOARD
TO
BE
RIGHT
THERE
IF
YOU
DROP
YOUR
ARMS
AT
YOUR
SIDE
AND
THEN
LIFT
YOUR
HANDS
UP
AT
THE
ELBOW
YOU
WANT
YOUR
KEYBOARD
UNDER
YOUR
HANDS
WHEN
YOUR
ELBOWS
ARE
AT
ABOUT
DEGREES
OF
COURSE
YOU
WANT
TO
AVOID
PRONATION
WRIST
EXTENSION
AND
ULNAR
DEVIATION
AT
ALL
COSTS
WRIST
PADS
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
HELP
AT
THIS
YOU
SHOULD
GET
SOMEBODY
ELSE
TO
COME
AND
LOOK
AT
HOW
YOU
