does

i
would
have
thought

in

back
into
the
atmosphere
sounds
like
a
cycle
to
me
obviously
it
takes
energy
to
run
the
cycle
but
i
seriously
doubt
that
helium
consumption
is
a
resource
issue
its
not
a
cycle
free
helium
will
escape
from
the
atmosphere
due
to
its
high
velocity
it
wont
be
practical
to
recover
it
it
has
to
be
mined
