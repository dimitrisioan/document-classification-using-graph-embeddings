WRITES
HOW
DOES
THE
HELIUM
GET
CONSUMED

WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
FAILURE
TO
CONTAIN
IT
PERFECTLY
WOULD
RESULT
IN
ITS
EVAPORATION
BACK
INTO
THE
ATMOSPHERE
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
CYCLE
TO
ME
OBVIOUSLY
IT
TAKES
ENERGY
TO
RUN
THE
CYCLE
BUT

SERIOUSLY
DOUBT
THAT
HELIUM
CONSUMPTION
IS
A
RESOURCE
ISSUE
ITS
NOT
A
CYCLE
FREE
HELIUM
WILL
ESCAPE
FROM
THE
ATMOSPHERE
DUE
TO
ITS
HIGH
VELOCITY
IT
WONT
BE
PRACTICAL
TO
RECOVER
IT
IT
HAS
TO
