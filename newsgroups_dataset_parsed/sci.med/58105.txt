physicians
should
know
the

literature
beyond
steere
cos
denial
merrygoround
patients
should
get
correctly
diagnosed
and
treated
why
do
you
think
steere
is
doing
this
isnt
he
acting
in
good
faith
after
all
as
the
discoverer
of
lyme
for
all
intents
and
purposes
the
more
famous
lyme
gets
the
more
famous
steere
gets
i
dont
see
the
ulterior
motive
here
it
is
easy
for
me
to
see
it
the
those
physicians
who
call
everything
lyme
and
treat
everything
there
is
a
lot
of
money
involved
im

not
a

jim
i
was
building
a
computer
manufacturing
company
when
i
got
lyme
i
lost
several
years
of
my
life
to
neartotal
disability
partially
as
a
result
the
company
failed
taking
with
it
over
jobs
my
savings
and
everything
id
worked
for
for
years
im
one
of
the
lucky
ones
in
that
i
found
a
physician
through
the
lyme
foundation
and
now
can
work
almost
fulltime
although
i
have
persistent
infection
and
still
suffer
a
variety
of
sypmtoms
and
now
i
try
to
follow
the
lyme
literature
well
it
is
tragic
what
has
happened
to
you
but
it
doesnt
necessarily
make
you
the
most
objective
source
of
information
about
it
if
your
whole
life
is
focussed
around
this
you
may
be
too
emotionally
involved
to
be
advising
other
people
who
may
or
may
not
have
lyme
certainly
advocacy
of
more
research
on
lyme
would
not
be
out
of
order
though
and
people
like
you
can
be
very
effective
