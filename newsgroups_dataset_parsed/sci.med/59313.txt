what
gives
he
asks
and

of

my
wife
thinks
its
from
sitting
for
long
periods
of
time
at
the
computer
reading
news
there
is
the
possibility
that
there
is
some
degree
of
constipation
causing
chronic
straining
which
has
caused
the
bowel
movements
the
classic
problems
that
are
supposed
to
be
looked
for
in
someone
with
a
hernia
are
constipation
chronic
cough
colon
cancer
and
youre
not
too
young
for
that
and
sitting
for
long
periods
of
time
at
the
computer
reading
news
good
luck
with
your
surgery
