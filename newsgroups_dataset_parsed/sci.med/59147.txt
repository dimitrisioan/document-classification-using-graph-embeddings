BILL
CLAUSSEN
WRITES
THIS
GROUP
WAS
ORIGINALLY
A
TAKEOFF
FROM
SCIMED
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
FORMATION
OF
THIS
GROUP
WAS
TO
DISCUSS
PRESCRIPTION
PSYCHOACTIVE
DRUGSSUCH
AS
OH
WELL
OBVIOUSLY
NO
ONE
REALLY
CARES
THEN
LET
ME
ASK
YOU
FOR
A
WORKABLE
SOLUTION
WE
HAVE
A
NAME
HERE
THAT
IMPLIES
CERTAIN
THINGS
TO
MANY
PEOPLE
RATHER
THAN
TRYING
TO
EDUCATE
EACH
AND
EVERY
PERSON
THAT
COMES
TO
THE
GROUP
IS
THERE
SOME
NAME
THAT
WOULD
IMPLY
WHAT
THIS
GROUP
WAS
ORIGINALLY
INTENDED
FOR
MY
DAD
WAS
A
LAWYER
AS
SUCH
I
GREW
UP
WITH
BEING
A
STICKLER
FOR
MEANING
IN
MY
REALITY
PSYCHOACTIVES
TECHNICALLY
COULD
RANGE
FROM
CAFFEINE
TO
DATURA
TO
THE
DRUGS
YOU
MENTION
TO
MORE
STANDARD
RECREATIONAL
DRUGS
IN
PRACTICE
I
HAD
HOPED
TO
SEE
IT
LIMITED
TO
THOSE
THAT
WERE
ABOVE
SOME
PSYCHOACTIVE
LEVEL
LIKE
SOME
OF
THE
DRUGS
YOU
MENTION
BUT
ALSO
POSSIBLY
INCLUDING
SOME
RECREATIONAL
DRUGS
BUT
WITH
CONVERSATION
LIMITED
TO
THEIR
PSYCHOACTIVE
EFFECTS
THE
RECENT
QUERY
ABOUT
BONG
WATER
I
THOUGHT
WAS
A
BIT
OFF
TOPIC
SO
I
JUST
HIT
K
BUT
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
WHAT
IS
A
WORKABLE
SOLUTION
WHAT
IS
A
WORKABLE
NAME
THAT
WOULD
IMPLY
THE
TOPIC
YOU
WITH
TO
DISCUSS
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
THERE
SHOULD
BE
A
ALTSMARTDRUGS
OR
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
I
DONT
FEEL
PSYCHOACTIVES
WOULD
GENERALLY
BE
USED
TO
DESCRIBE
ALOT
OF
THOSE
DRUGS
THERE
IS
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
DRUG
THAT
IF
TAKEN
IN
CERTAIN
DOSES
OVER
A
PERIOD
OF
DAYS
MAY
HAVE
A
PSYCHOACTIVE
EFFECT
IN
SOME
PEOPLE
VS
MANY
OF
THE
DRUGS
IN
PIHKAH
WHICH
ARE
PSYCHOACTIVE
WM
IF
PROCHOICE
MEANS
CHOICE
AFTER
CONCEPTION
DOES
THIS
APPLY
TO
MEN
TOO
