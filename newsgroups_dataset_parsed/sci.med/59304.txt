I
DONT
LIKE
THE
TERM
QUACK
BEING
APPLIED
TO
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
DAVID
QUESTIONABLE
CONDUCT
IS
MORE
APPROPRIATELY
CALLED
UNETHICALIN
MY
OPINION
USING
LAETRIL
TO
TREAT
CANCER
PATIENTS
WHEN
SUCH
TREATMENT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
BE
INEFFECTIVE
AND
DANGEROUSCYANIDE
RELEASE
BY
THE
NCI
HMM
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
AMONG
THE
THINGS
I
WOULD
REFER
TO
AS
QUACK
THERAPY
AND
WOULD
TEND
TO
REFER
TO
ANY
PRACTITIONER
WHO
PRESCRIBED
LAETRILE
WHETHER
LICENSED
OR
NOT
AS
A
QUACK
THERE
ARE
UNETHICAL
BEHAVIORS
SUCH
AS
ORDERING
UNNECCESSARY
TESTS
TO
INCREASE
FEES
WHICH
I
WOULD
NOT
LABLE
AS
QUACKISH
BUT
PRESCRIBING
KNOWN
INEFFECTIVE
THERAPIES
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
HALLMARKS
OF
A
QUACK
DAVID
RIND
ONE
OF
THE
RESPONSIBILITIES
OF
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
IS
TO
READ
THE
MEDICAL
LITERATURE
TO
KEEP
UP
WITH
CHANGES
IN
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
ALL
THE
CLAMOR
OVER
LAETRIL
RESULTED
IN
THE
NCI
SPENDING
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
MONEY
ON
CLINICAL
TRIALS
WHICH
PROVEDTO
ME
ANYWAY
THAT
LAETRIL
WAS
INEFFECTIVE
AGAINST
CANCER
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
CONTINUED
TO
USE
IT
WHEN
BETTER
MORE
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENTS
ARE
AVAILABLE
MAY
DESERVE
TO
BE
CALLED
A
QUACK
ANTIFUNGALS
ARE
IN
A
DIFFERENT
CLASS
THE
BIG
QUESTION
SEEMS
TO
BE
IS
IT
REASONABLE
TO
USE
THEM
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
GI
DISTRESS
OR
SINUS
PROBLEMS
THAT
COULD
BE
DUE
TO
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
FOLLOWING
THE
USE
OF
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTICS
GORDEN
RUBENFELD
THROUGH
EMAIL
HAS
ASSURED
ME
THAT
MOST
PHYSICIANS
RECOGNIZE
THE
CHANCE
OF
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
OCCURING
AFTER
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
AND
THEY
THEREFORE
REINNOCULATE
THEIR
PATIENTS
WITH
GOOD
BACTERIA
TO
RESTORE
COMPETETION
FOR
CANDIDA
IN
THE
BODY
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
YET
A
STANDARD
PART
OF
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
HE
DEALS
WITH
CRITICAL
CARE
PATIENTS
WHERE
FUNGAL
INFECTIONSYSTEMIC
IS
A
REAL
PROBLEM
AND
JUST
BECAUSE
HE
TRIES
TO
KEEP
GOOD
BACTERIA
IN
HIS
PATIENTS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
ALL
PHYSICIANS
DO
THIS
I
THINK
THAT
ASPERGILLIS
IS
MORE
LIKELY
TO
BE
FOUND
IN
THE
SINUS
MUCUS
MEMBRANES
THAN
IS
CANDIDA
WOMEN
HAVE
BEEN
KNOWN
FOR
A
VERY
LONG
TIME
TO
SUFFER
FROM
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IN
THE
VAGINA
AND
A
WOMEN
IS
LUCKY
TO
FIND
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
IS
WILLING
TO
TREAT
THE
CAUSE
AND
NOT
GIVE
GIVE
HER
ADVISE
TO
USE
THE
OTC
ANTIFUNGAL
CREAMS
SINCE
CANDIDA
COLONIZES
PRIMARILY
IN
THE
ANORECTAL
AREA
GI
SYMPTOMS
SHOULD
BE
MORE
COMMON
THAN
VAGINAL
PROBLEMS
AFTER
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
THE
PROBLEM
WE
HAVE
HERE
DAVID
IS
PROOF
THAT
GI
DISCOMFORT
CAN
BE
CAUSED
BY
A
CANDIDA
BLOOM
THE
ARGUEMENT
IS
THAT
WITHOUT
PROOF
NO
ACTION
IS
WARRENTED
MEDICINE
HAS
NOT
AND
PROBALBY
NEVER
WILL
BE
PRACTICED
THIS
WAY
THERE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THE
USE
OF
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
A
VERY
GOOD
EXAMPLE
IS
KIDNEY
STONES
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOMBECAUSE
CLINICAL
TRAILS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
DONE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
AN
EFFECTIVE
PREVENTION
WAS
THAT
RESTRICITNG
THE
INTAKE
OF
CALCIUM
AND
OXALATES
WAS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
PREVENT
KIDNEY
STONES
FROM
FORMING
CLINICAL
TRIALS
FOCUSED
ON
DRUGS
OR
ULTRASONIC
BLASTS
TO
BREAKDOWN
THE
STONE
ONCE
IT
FORMED
THROUGH
THE
RECENT
NEW
ENGLAND
J
OF
MEDICINE
ARTICLE
WE
NOW
KNOW
THAT
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
WAS
WRONG
INCREASING
CALCIUM
INTAKE
IS
BETTER
AT
PREVENTING
STONE
FORMATION
THAN
IS
RESTRICTING
CALCIUM
INTAKE
THE
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
IN
ANIMAL
HUSBANDRY
HAS
BEEN
THAT
ANIMALS
NEED
TO
BE
REINNOCULATED
WITH
GOOD
BACTERIA
AFTER
COMING
OFF
ANTIBIOTIC
THERAPY
IF
IT
MAKES
SENSE
FOR
LIVESTOCK
WHY
DOESNT
IT
MAKE
SENSE
FOR
HUMANS
DAVID
WE
ARE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
A
DANGEROUS
TREATMENTUNLESS
YOU
CONSIDER
YOGURT
DANGEROUS
IF
THIS
WERE
A
STANDARD
PART
OF

AS

SAYS
IT
IS
