CUSTER
WRITES
ALSO
IM
NOT
SURE
THAT
PHYSICIAN
FEES
AT
THE
VERY
VERY
HIGHEST
LEVELS
DONT
HAVE
TO
COME
DOWN
IM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
BULK
OF
PHYSICIANS
MAKING
GOOD
BUT
NOT
GREAT
SALARIES
WHO
HAVE
MEGALOANS
FROM
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
DEBTS
ID
ALSO
LIKE
TO
SEE
SOME
STRONG
ETHICS
WITH
TEETH
FOR
PHYSICIANS
I
AGREE
THAT
SOME
SPECIALTIES
HAVE
GOTTEN
WAY
OUT
OF
LINE
THE
MAIN
PROBLEM
IS
THE
PAYMENT
METHOD
FOR
PROCEDURES
RATHER
THAN
TIME
DISTORTS
THE
SYSTEM
I
HOPE
THEY
WILL
FIX
THAT
BUT
IM
AFRAID
AS
USUAL
THE
LOCAL
DOC
IS
GOING
TO
TAKE
THE
BRUNT
PEOPLE
GROUSE
ABOUT
PAYING
TO
SEE
THEIR
HOME
DOCTOR
IN
HIS
OFFICE
BUT
DONT
MIND
PAYING
TO
HAVE
BRAIN
SURGERY
THEY
THINK
THEIR
LOCAL
DOC
IS
CHEATING
THEM
BUT
WORSHIP
THE
FEET
OF
THE
NEUROSURGEON
WHO
SAVED
THEIR
LIFE
WHAT
THEY
DONT
REALIZE
IS
THAT
WE
NEED
MORE
LOCAL
DOCS
AND
FEWER
GORDON
BANKS
SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND
GEBCADREDSLPITTEDU
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
