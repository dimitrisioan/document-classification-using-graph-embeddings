scan
deleted
is
there
anything
i
can
do
about
these
pigs
id
suggest
writing
a
detailed
letter
about
the
incident
to
the
hospital
administrator
specify
the
date
and
time
if
possible
the
names
of
the
technicians
send
a
copy
to
the
clinician
under
whose
care
your
friend
was
admitted
i
say
this
because
though
your
friend
has
no
argument
with
the
doctor
i
have
found
that
administrators
sometimes
ignore
complaints
until
the
patient
becomes
litigious
clinicians
may
not
have
been
informed
of
the
complaint
and
are
very
surprised
to
find
themselves
named
in
a
suit
if
there
is
no
response
within
a
week
send
a
follow
up
letter
attach
a
photocopy
of
the
original
letter
do
this
weekly
until
you
do
get
a
response
cat
scans
are
noninvasive
but
they
can
be
very
scary
the
scanner
can
be
a
bad
place
for
the
claustrophobic
there
was
an
interesting
study
in
the
bmj
about
years
ago
which
found
that
around
of
people
who
had
cat
scans
found
it
so
unpleasant
that
they
would
never
have
another
this
compares
with
who
said
the
same
about
a
lumbar
puncture
