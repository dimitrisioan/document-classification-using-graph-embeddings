RE
USE
OF
HALDOL
IN
ELDERLY
IVE
SEEN
PEOPLE
IN
THEIR
FORTIES
AND
FIFTIES
BECOME
DISORIENTED
AND
DEMENTED
DURING
HOSPITAL
STAYS
IN
THE
EXAMPLES
IVE
SEEN
DRUGS
WERE
DEFINITELY
INVOLVED
MY
OWN
FATHER
TURNED
INTO
A
VEGETABLE
FOR
A
SHORT
TIME
WHILE
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
HE
WAS
FIFTYTHREE
AT
THE
TIME
AND
HE
WAS
ON
SEPARATE
MEDICATIONS
THE
FAMILY
PROTESTED
BUT
THE
DOCTORS
WERE
ADAMANT
TELLING
US
THAT
NONE
OF
THE
DRUGS
INTERACT
THEY
EVEN
TOOK
THE
ATTITUDE
THAT
IF
HE
WAS
DISORIENTED
THEY
SHOULD
PUT
HIM
ON
SOMETHING
ELSE
AS
WELL
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
AN
MD
FRIEND
OF
THE
FAMILY
WE
HAD
ALL
HIS
MEDICATION
DISCONTINUED
HE
HAD
A
SEIZURE
THAT
NIGHT
AND
WAS
PUT
BACK
ON
ONE
DRUG
TWO
DAYS
LATER
HE
WAS
HIS
OLD
SELF
AGAIN
I
GUESS
THERE
ARENT
MANY
MEDICAL
TEXTS
THAT
ADDRESS
THE
SUBJECT
OF
INTERACTIONS
I
DONT
MEAN
THIS
AS
A
CHEAP
SHOT
AT
THE
MEDICAL
PROFESSION
IT
IS
AN
ASPECT
OF
HOSPITALS
THAT
IS
VERY
FRIGHTENING
TO
ME
DOCS
SEEM
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
CLOSE
CONTROL
OF
YOU
ITS
QUITE
ALL
RIGHT
TO
TAKE
YOUR
BODILY
EQUILIBRIA
INTO
THEIR
OWN
HANDS
THAT
CONTROL
REDUCES
THE
CHANCE
THAT
THE
PATIENT
WILL
MAKE
A
MISTAKE
BUT
HEALTH
CARE
PROVIDERS
CAN
MAKE
MISTAKES
TOO
AND
MISTAKES
CAN
BE
DEADLY
UNDER
THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
GRANT
YOU
THAT
SOMETIMES
THERES
NO
CHOICE
NEVERTHELESS
I
SUGGEST
YOU
PROCURE
A
LIST
OF
THE
DRUGS
YOUR
GRANDMOTHER
IS
GETTING
AND
DISCUSS
IT
WITH
AN
INDEPENDENT
DOC
HER
PROBLEMS
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
EFFECT
OF
HALDOL
AT
ALL
HALDOL
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
USED
VALIDLY
OR
IT
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
PRESCRIBED
BECAUSE
OTHER
MEDICATION
CONFUSED
HER
AND
BECAUSE
THE
HOSPITAL
NORMALLY
PRESCRIBES
HALDOL
FOR
THE
CONFUSED
ELDERLY
JUST
MY
OPINION
LARRY
OBVIOUSLY
NOT
A
DOC
