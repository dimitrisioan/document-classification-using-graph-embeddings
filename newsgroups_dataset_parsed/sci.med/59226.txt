IBD
IN

BMDELANEQUADSUCHICAGOEDU
BRIAN
MANNING
DELANEY
WROTE
ONE
THING
THAT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IN
THIS
THREAD
IS
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
RELATION
BETWEEN
IBD
INFLAMMATION
AND
THE
PROFILE
OF
INGESTED
FATTY
ACIDS
FAS
I
WAS
DIAGNOSED
LAST
MAY
WCROHNS
OF
THE
TERMINAL
ILEUM
WHEN
I
GOT
OUT
OF
THE
HOSPITAL
I
READ
UP
ON
IT
A
BIT
AND
CAME
ACROSS
SEVERAL
STUDIES
INVESTIGATING
THE
ROLE
OF
EPA
AN
ESSENTIALLY
FA
IN
REDUCING
INFLAMMATION
THE
EVIDENCE
WAS
MIXED
MANY
OF
THESE
STUDIES
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
INFLAMMATORY
BOWEL
DISEASE
MACDERMOTT
STENSON
BUT
IF
I
RECALL
CORRECTLY
THERE
WERE
SOME
METHODOLOGICAL
BONES
TO
BE
PICKED
WITH
THE
STUDIES
BOTH
THE
ONES
WPOS
AND
WNEG
RESULTS
IN
THE
STUDIES
PATIENTS
WERE
GIVEN
EPA
A
FEW
GRAMSDAY
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
STUDIES
BUT
IF
I
RECALL
CORRECTLY
THERE
WAS
NO
RESTRICTION
OF
THE
OTHER
FAS
THAT
THE
PATIENTS
COULD
CONSUME
FROM
THE
INFORMED
LAYPERSONS
PERSPECTIVE
THIS
SEEMS
MISTAKEN
IF
LOTS
OF
FAS
ARE
CONSUMED
ALONG
WITH
THE
EPA
THEN
THE
RATIO
OF
BAD
PROSTANOID
PRODUCTS
TO
GOOD
PROSTANOID
PRODUCTS
COULD
STILL
BE
FAIRLY
BAD
ISNT
THIS
RATIO
THE
ISSUE
WHATS
THE
VIEW
OF
THE
GASTRO
COMMUNITY
ON
EPA
THESE
DAYS
EPA
SUPPLEMENTS
ALONG
WITH
A
FAIRLY
SEVERE
RESTRICTION
OF
OTHER
FAS
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
HELPED
ME
SIGNIFICANTLY
THOUGH
IT
COULD
JUST
BE
THE
LOW
ABSOLUTE
AMOUNT
OF
FAT
I
EAT
CALORIES
BRIAN
BMDELANEMIDWAYUCHICAGOEDU
AS
YOU
NOTE
THE
RESEARCH
IS
MIXED
SO
THERE
IS
NO
CONSENSUS
ON
THE
ROLE
OF
FATTY
ACIDS
IN
ULCERATIVE
COLITIS
THERE
IS
A
ROLE
FOR
SHORT
CHAIN
FATTY
ACIDS
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
COLOSTOMIES
AND
RECTAL
POUCHES
THAT
ARE
INFLAMMED
SHORT
IS
BUTYRATE
AND
SHORTER
THERE
MAY
BE
A
ROLE
FOR
TREATMENT
OF
UC
WITH
SHORT
CHAIN
FATTY
ACIDS
AND
I
AM
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
THE
UPCOMING
AGA
MEETING
IN
BOSTON
TO
SEE
WHAT
PEOPLE
ARE
DOING
YOU
RAISE
A
HYPOTHESIS
ABOUT
THE
STUDIES
AND
RESTRICTION
OF
OTHER
FATTY
ACIDS
YOU
SHOULD
CONTACT
THE
AUTHORS
DIRECTLY
ABOUT
THAT
OR
EVEN
WRITE
A
LETTER
TO
THE
EDITOR
IT
IS
A
GOOD
POINT
BY
THE
WAY
THE
ABBREVIATION
EPA
IS
NOT
IN
GENERAL
USE
SO
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
FATTY
ACID
YOU
ARE
SPEAKING
ABOUT
AND
TO
BRIAN
AN
U
OF
C
THERE
IS
A
PHYSICIAN
NAMED
STEPHEN
HANAUER
THERE
WHO
IS
A
RECOGNIZED
EXPERT
IN
THE
TREATMENT
OF
IBD
YOU
MIGHT
GIVE
HIM
A
CALL
HE
IS
INTERESTED
IN
NEW
COMBINATIONS
OF
DRUGS
FOR
THE
TREATMENT
OF
IBD
IF
YOU
CALL
PLEASE
SAY
HELLO
TO
HIM
FROM
ME
I
WAS
LOOKING
AT
U
OF
C
FOR
A
POSITION
AND
PERHAPS
STILL
AM
AND
BE
SURE
TO
LOOK
INTO
JOINING
THE
CCFA
BEST
OF
LUCK
