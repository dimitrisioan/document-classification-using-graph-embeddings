IS
THERE
SUCH
A
THING
AS
MSG
MONOSODIUM
GLUTAMATE
SENSITIVITY
I
SAW
IN
THE
NY
TIMES
SUNDAY
THAT
SCIENTISTS
HAVE
TESTIFIED
BEFORE
AN
FDA
ADVISORY
PANEL
THAT
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
MSG
SENSITIVITY
ARE
SUPERSTITION
ANYBODY
HERE
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
IM
OLD
ENOUGH
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
ISSUE
HAS
COME
UP
AT
LEAST
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
SINCE
THE
THEN
IT
WAS
CALLED
THE
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
SYNDROME
BECAUSE
CHINESE
CUISINE
HAS
ALWAYS
USED
IT
SO
FAR
IVE
SEEN
ABOUT
A
DOZEN
POSTS
OF
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
BUT
NO
FACTS
I
SUSPECT
THERE
IS
A
STRONG
PSYCHOLOGICAL
EFFECT
AT
WORK
HERE
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
RESULTS
FROM
A
SCIENTIFIC
STUDY
USING
DOUBLEBLIND
TRIALS
HERE
IS
ANOTHER
ANECDOTAL
STORY
I
AM
A
PICKY
EATER
AND
NEVER
WANTED
TO
TRY
CHINESE
FOOD
HOWEVER
I
FINALLY
TRIED
SOME
IN
ORDER
TO
PLEASE
A
GIRL
I
WAS
SEEING
AT
THE
TIME
I
HAD
NEVER
HEARD
OF
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
SYNDROME
A
GROUP
OF
US
WENT
TO
THE
RESTAURANT
AND
ALL
SHARED
DIFFERENT
DISHES
IT
DIDNT
TASTE
GREAT
BUT
I
DECIDED
IT
WASNT
SO
BAD
WE
WENT
HOME
AND
WENT
TO
BED
EARLY
I
WOKE
UP
AT
AM
AND
PUKED
MY
GUTS
OUTS
I
THREW
UP
FOR
SO
LONG
THAT
IM
NOT
KIDDING
I
PULLED
A
MUSCLE
IN
MY
TONGUE
DRY
HEAVES
AND
EVERYTHING
NO
ONE
ELSE
GOT
SICK
AND
IM
NOT
ALLERGIC
TO
ANYTHING
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
SUFFICE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
WONT
GO
INTO
A
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
UNLESS
I
AM
PHYSICALLY
THREATENED
THE
SMELL
OF
THE
FOOD
MAKES
ME
ILL
AND
THAT
IS
A
PSYCHOLGICAL
REACTION
WHEN
I
HAVE
BEEN
DRAGGED
IN
TO
SUFFER
THROUGH
BEEF
AND
BROCCOLI
WITHOUT
ANY
SAUCES
I
INSIST
ON
NO
MSG
I
HAVENT
GOTTEN
SICK
YET
