WRITES
TWO
DIFFERENT
TUESDAYS
TWO
WEEKS
APART
WE
USED
THE
SAME
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
JUST
FOR
CONSISTANCIES
SAKE
WE
ORDERED
FOOD
FROM
THE
LOCAL
CHINESE
TAKE
OUT
SAME
EXACT
FOOD
EXCEPT
ONE
OF
THE
DAYS
WE
HAD
THEM
HOLD
THE
MSG
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHICH
TIME
THE
FOOD
WAS
ORDERED
WITHOUT
THE
MSG
BUT
ONE
TIME
I
HAD
THE
REACTION
AND
ONE
TIME
I
DID
NOT
NOW
YOU
CAN
TRY
TO
TELL
ME
THAT
IT
WASNT
SCIENTIFIC
ENOUGH
AND
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
PROVEN
BEYOND
THE
SHADOW
OF
A
DOUBT
THAT
I
HAVE
A
REACTION
TO
MSG
BUT
IT
WAS
PROOF
ENOUGH
FOR
ME
AND
ILL
HAVE
YOU
KNOW
THAT
I
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
GET
SICK
FROM
EATING
FOOD
THANK
YOU
VERY
MUCH
IF
YOU
COULD
NOT
TELL
WHICH
ONE
HAD
MSG
WHY
RESTAURANTS
BOTHER
TO
USE
IT
AT
ALL
IF
YOU
CAN
TASTE
THE
DIFFERENCE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
REACTION
MIGHT
PLAY
A
ROLE
THE
FACT
IS
MSG
IS
PART
OF
NATURAL
SUBSTANCE
EVERYONE
I
MEAN
EVERYONE
CONSUMES
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
MSG
EVERY
DAY
THROUGH
REGULAR
DIET
WITHOUT
THE
SYNTHESIZED
MSG
ADDITIVE
CHINESE
AND
MANY
OTHER
ASIANS
JAPANESE
KOREANS
ETC
HAVE
USED
MSG
AS
FLAVOR
ENHANCER
FOR
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
KNEW
HOW
TO
MAKE
MSG
FROM
CHEMICAL
PROCESSES
NOT
THEY
JUST
EXTRACTED
IT
FROM
NATURAL
FOOD
SUCH
SEA
FOOD
AND
MEAT
BROTH
BARING
MSG
IS
JUST
LIKE
BARING
SUGAR
WHICH
MANY
PEOPLE
REACT
TO
