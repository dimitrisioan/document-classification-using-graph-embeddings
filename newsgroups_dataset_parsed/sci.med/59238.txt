MY
WIFES
OBGYN
HAS
AN
ULTRASOUND
MACHINE
IN
HER
OFFICE
WHEN
ON
HER
NEXT
VISIT
MY
WIFE
ASKED
ANOTHER
DOCTOR
IN
THE
OFFICE
IF
THEY
READ
THE
ULTRASOUNDS
THEMSELVES
OR
IF
THEY
HAD
A
RADIOLOGIST
READ
THE
PICTURES
THE
DOCTOR
VERY
VEHEMENTLY
INSISTED
THAT
THEY
WERE
QUALIFIED
TO
READ
THE
ULTRASOUND
AND
RADIOLOGISTS
WERE
NOT
MY
WIFE
IS
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THIS
SHE
SAW
A
TV
SHOW
A
COUPLE
MONTHS
BACK
SOMETHING
LIKE
OR
DATELINE
NBC
ETC
WHERE
AN
EXPERT
ON
FETAL
ULTRASOUNDS
A
RADIOLOGIST
WAS
SHOWING
ALL
THE
DIFFERENT
DEFFECTS
THAT
COULD
BE
DETECTED
USING
THE
ULTRASOUND
SHOULD
MY
WIFE
BE
CONCERNED
SHOULD
WE
TAKE
THE
PICTURES
TO
A
RADIOLOGIST
FOR
A
SECOND
OPINION
AND
IF
SO
WHERE
WOULD
WE
FIND
SUCH
AN
EXPERT
IN
CHICAGO
WE
DONT
REALLY
HAVE
ANY
SPECIAL
MEDICAL
REASON
TO
BE
CONCERNED
BUT
IF
A
RADIOLOGIST
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
SEE
THINGS
THE
OBGYN
CANT
THEN
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
WE
SHOULDNT
USE
ONE
ANY
THOUGHTS
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
IF
YOUR
OBSTETRITION
HAS
AN
ULTRASOUND
IN
HIS
ROOMS
AND
IS
EXPIRIENCED
ITS
USE
AND
INTERPRETATION
HE
SHOULD
BE
JUST
AS
CAPABLE
OF
READING
IT
AS
ANY
RADIOLOGIST
ALL
DOCTORS
ARE
QUALIFIED
TO
READ
XRAYS
US
CT
SCANS
ETC
IT
IS
JUST
THAT
A
RADIOLOGIST
DOES
NOTHING
ELSE
AND
THUS
IS
ONLY
BETTER
AT
READING
THEM
BECAUSE
OF
ALL
THIS
TIME
SPENT
DOING
THIS
SKILL
IN
READING
XRAYS
ETC
JUST
COMES
FROM
PLENTY
OF
PRACTICE
IF
YOUR
OBSTETRITION
READS
HEAPS
OF
OBSTETRIC
ULTRASOUNDS
HE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PICK
UP
ANY
ABNORMALITIES
THAT
CAN
BE
DEMONSTRATED

THIS
