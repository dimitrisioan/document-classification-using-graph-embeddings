mary

exclaims
ma
excuse
me
ma
why
cant
people
learn
to
cook
from
scratch
on
the
net
ma
ive
gotten
lots
of
recipes
off
the
net
that
dont
use
additives
because
one
simply
cant
cook
on
the
net
nor
can
one
cook
while
on
the
net
cooking
is
best
done
in
a
kitchen
on
a
stove
gotcha
grin
i
said
this
out
of
general
frustration
at
people
not
anyone
in
particular
who
seem
to
expect
packaged
food
to
conform
to
their
tastes
in
other
words
if
packaged
foods
are
not
to
your
liking
prepare
foods
that
are
ma
if
you
like
additives
then
get
off
the
net
and
go
to
your
local
ma
supermarket
buy
lots
of
packaged
foods
and
you
get
off
the
net
i
dont
have
strong
feelings
about
additives
as
long
as
i
cant
taste
em
as
for
the
rest
of
your
reply
to
me
i
am
sorry
it
it
seemed
as
if
i
was
picking
on
you
i
wasnt
trying
to
do
so
please
accept
my
apologies
