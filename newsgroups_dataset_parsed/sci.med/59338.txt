THERE
IS
SIGNIFICANT

BETWEEN
THE

THESE
TWO
EMPIRIC

ARE
WE
TALKING

REAL

THE

HYPOTHESIS
THE
EFFICACY
OF
ROUTINE
BACTERIAL
REPOPULATION
IN
HUMANS
OR
THE
ABILITY
OF
ANECDOTALLY

CHALLENGED
BY
A
NEGATIVE
RANDOMIZED
TRIAL
TO
CONFIRM
AN
ETIOLOGIC
HYPOTHESIS
POST
HOC
ERGO
PROPTER
HOC
WE
CANT
SEEM
TO
FOCUS
IN
ON
A
DISEASE
A
THERAPY
OR
A
HYPOTHESIS
UNDER
DISCUSSION
IM
LOST
POINT
IM
BEGINNING
TO
SEE
THAT
PART
OF
THE
DISAGREEMENTS
ABOUT
THE
WHOLE
YEAST
ISSUE
IS
ON
DIFFERING
PERCEPTIONS
AND
ON
DIFFERING
MEANINGS
OF
WORDS
MEDICAL
DOCTORS
HAVE
A
VERY
SPECIFIC
AND
SPECIALIZED
JARGON
NECESSARY
FOR
PRECISE
COMMUNICATION
WITHIN
THEIR
FIELD
WHICH
IM
FULLY
COGNIZANT
OF
SINCE
I
TOO
SPEAK
JARGONESE
WHEN
WITH
MY
PEERS
FOR
THE
SITUATION
IN
SCIMED
MANY
TIMES
THE
WORDS
OR
PHRASES
USED
BY
DOCTORS
CAN
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
AND
MORE
SPECIFIC
MEANING
THAN
THE
SAME
WORD
USED
IN
THE
WORLD
AT
LARGE
CAUSING
SIGNIFICANT
MISCOMMUNICATION
ONE
EXAMPLE
WORD
AND
VERY
RELEVANT
TO
THE
YEAST
DISCUSSION
IS
THE
EXACT
MEANING
OF
SYSTEMIC
IT
IS
NOW
OBVIOUS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
MEANING
OF
THIS
WORD
IS
VERY
SPECIFIC
MUCH
MORE
SO
THAN
ITS
MEANING
TO
A
NONDOCTOR
THERE
IS
ALSO
THE
OBSERVATION
OF
THIS
NEWSGROUP
THAT
BOTH
DOCTORS
AND
NONDOCTORS
COME
TOGETHER
ON
ESSENTIALLY
EQUAL
TERMS
WHICH
WHEN
COMBINED
WITH
THE
JARGON
ISSUE
CAN
FURTHER
FAN
THE
FLAMES
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
THE
FIRST
TIME
THAT
PRACTICING
DOCTORS
GET
REALLY
BEAT
UP
BY
NONDOCTORS
FOR
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
MEDICINE
WHICH
THEY
OTHERWISE
DONT
SEE
MUCH
OF
IN
THEIR
PRACTICE
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
OCCASIONAL
DIFFICULT
PATIENT
POINT
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
VIEWPOINT
AMONG
MANY
PRACTICING
DOCTORS
THAT
THEY
WILL
NOT
PRESCRIBE
ANY
TREATMENTSTHERAPIES
FOR
THEIR
PATIENTS
UNLESS
SUCH
TREATMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
BE
EFFECTIVE
AND
THE
RISKS
UNDERSTOOD
FROM
WELLCONSTRUCTED
CLINICAL
TRIALS
USUALLY
DOUBLEBLIND
OR
THAT
SUCH
TREATMENTSTHERAPIES
ARE
PART
OF
AN
APPROVED
AND
FUNDED
CLINICAL
TRIAL
TO
THESE
DOCTORS
TO
DO
ANY
DIFFERENTLY
WOULD
IN
THIS
BELIEF
SYSTEM
BE
UNETHICAL
PRACTICE
AND
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
ANY
THERAPY
NOT
ON
THE
ACCEPTED
LIST
IS
THEREFORE
A
NON
THERAPY
IT
DOES
NOT
EVEN
EXIST
NOR
DOES
THE
UNDERLYING
HYPOTHESIS
OR
THEORY
HAVE
ANY
VALIDITY
EVEN
IF
IT
SOUNDS
VERY
PLAUSIBLE
BY
EXTRAPOLATION
OF
WHAT
IS
CURRENTLY
KNOWN
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
HAS
NO
VALUE
EITHER
FROM
A
TREATMENT
POINTOFVIEW
AND
BY
AND
LARGE
AS
A
SCIENTIST
MYSELF
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
SCIENCE
TAKES
SUCH
A
RIGOROUS
APPROACH
TO
MEDICAL
TREATMENT
HOWEVER
AS
ALSO
BEING
A
HUMAN
BEING
LAST
I
CHECKED
AND
HAVING
BEEN
ONE
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
SIGNIFICANTLY
HELPED
BY
A
CURRENTLY
UNACCEPTED
TREATMENT
WHERE
STANDARD
MEDICINE
WAS
NOT
ABLE
TO
HELP
ME
HAS
CAUSED
ME
TO
SIT
BACK
AND
WONDER
IF
HOLDING
SUCH
AN
EXTREME
AND
RIGID
SCIENTIFIC
VIEWPOINT
IS
IN
ITSELF
UNETHICAL
FROM
HUMANITARIAN
CONSIDERATIONS
AFTER
ALL
THE
UNDERLYING
INTENT
OF
THE
SCIENTIFIC
APPROACH
TO
MEDICINE
IS
TO
PROTECT
THE
HEALTH
OF
THE
PATIENT
BY
PROVIDING
THE
BEST
POSSIBLE
CARE
FOR
THE
PATIENT
SO
THE
PATIENT
SHOULD
COME
FIRST
WHEN
CONSIDERING
TREATMENT
WHAT
WE
NEED
IS
A
SLIGHTLY
MODIFIED
APPROACH
TO
TREATMENT
THAT
SATISFIES
BOTH
THE
SCIENTIFIC
AND
THE
HUMANITARIAN
VIEWPOINTS
IN
AN
EARLIER
POST
I
OUTLINED
A
CRAZY
IDEA
FOR
DOING
JUST
THAT
THE
GIST
OF
IT
WAS
TO
GIVE
ANY
PHYSICIAN
FREEDOM
AND
ENCOURAGEMENT
BY
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
TO
PRESCRIBE
ALTERNATE
NOT
YET
PROVEN
THERAPIES
MAYBE
SUPPORTED
BY
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
PATIENTS
WHO
ALL
AVENUES
OF
ACCEPTED
THERAPIES
HAVE
BEEN
EXHAUSTED
AND
NOT
UNTIL
THEN
THE
PATIENT
WOULD
BE
FULLY
INFORMED
THAT
SUCH
THERAPIESTREATMENTS
ARE
NOT
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
PROPER
CLINICAL
TRIALS
AND
THAT
THERE
ARE
REAL
POTENTIAL
RISKS
WITH
REAL
POSSIBILITIES
OF
NO
BENEFIT
DERIVED
FROM
THEM
THIS
APPROACH
SATISFIES
THE
NEED
FOR
SCIENTIFIC
RIGOR
IT
ALSO
SATISFIES
THE
HUMANITARIAN
NEEDS
OF
THE
PATIENT
AND
THE
REALITY
IS
THAT
MANY
PATIENTS
WHO
HAVE
REACHED
A
DEADEND
IN
THE
TREATMENT
OF
THEIR
SYMPTOMS
USING
ACCEPTED
MEDICINE
WILL
GO
OUTSIDE
THE
ORTHODOX
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
EITHER
TO
THE
DOCTORS
WHO
ARE
BRAVE
ENOUGH
TO
PRESCRIBE
SUCH
TREATMENTS
AT
THE
RISK
OF
LOSING
THEIR
LICENSE
OR
WORSE
TO
NONDOCTORS
WHO
HAVE
NOT
HAD
THE
PROPER
MEDICAL
TRAINING
THIS
APPROACH
ALSO
RECOGNIZES
THIS
REALITY
AND
KEEPS
THE
CONTROL
MORE
WITHIN
ORTHODOX
MEDICINE
WITH
THE
BENEFITS
THAT
THE
INFORMATION
GLEANED
COULD
HELP
FOCUS
LIMITED
RESOURCES
TOWARDS
FUTURE
CLINICAL
TRIALS
IN
THE
MOST
PRODUCTIVE
WAY
EVERYBODY
WINS
IN
THIS
ADMITTEDLY
ROSECOLORED
APPROACH
IM
SURE
THERE
ARE
REAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
AS
WELL
IT
IS
PRESENTED
MORE
AS
A
STRAWMAN
TO
STIMULATE
DISCUSSION
HOPEFULLY
WHAT
I
WRITE
HERE
MAY
GIVE
THE
SCIMED
DOCTORS
A
BETTER
IDEA
AS
TO
WHY
I
AM
OPEN
TO
ALTERNATIVE
THERAPIES
AS
WELL
AS
WHY
I
HAVE
REAL
DIFFICULTY
READ
APPARENT
HOSTILITY
WITH
THE
COLDNESS
OF
THE
PURE
SCIENTIFIC
APPROACH
TO
MEDICINE
I
BELIEVE
THE
BEST
APPROACH
TO
MEDICAL
TREATMENT
IS
ONE
WHERE
BOTH
THE
HUMANITARIAN
ASPECTS
ARE
BALANCED
WITH
AND
BY
THE
SCIENTIFIC
ASPECTS
ANYTHING
ELSE
IS
JUST
NOT
GOOD
MEDICINE
