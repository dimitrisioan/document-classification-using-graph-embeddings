BOB
MCCOWN
WRITES
WERE
ABOUT
TO
HAVE
OUR
FIRST
BABY
AND
HAVE
A
FEW
QUESTIONS
THAT
WE
DONT
SEEM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
ANSWERED
TO
OUR
SATISFACTION
REGUARDING
HAVING
A
BABY
BOY
CIRCUMSIZED
WHAT
ARE
THE
MEDICAL
PROS
AND
CONS
ALL
WEVE
HEARD
IS
ITS
UP
TO
THE
PARENTS
UNFORTONATELY
THAT
TRULY
IS
ABOUT
THE
BEST
SUMMATION
OF
THE
RESEARCH
THAT
THERE
IS
ADVANTAGES
STATED
OF
CIRCUMCISON
INCLUDED
PROBABLY
PREVENTION
OF
PENILE
CANCER
WHICH
INTERESTINGLY
OCCURS
MOSTLY
IN
MEN
WHOSE
PERSONAL
HYGIENE
IS
EXCEPTIONALLY
POOR
SIMPLICITY
OF
PERSONAL
HYGIENE
PREVENTION
OF
URINARY
TRACT
INFECTIONS
AND
PREVENTION
OF
A
UNRETRACTIBLE
FORESKIN
DISADVANTAGES
INCLUDE
INFECTION
FROM
THE
PROCEDURE
PAIN
ETC
I
APOLOGIZE
I
AM
TRYING
TO
PULL
THIS
OFF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
I
WILL
POST
WHAT
I
DISCOVERED
IN
RESEARCH
I
DID
A
PAPER
ON
THE
TOPIC
IN
MY
RESEARCH
CLASS
IN
NURSING
SCHOOL
IT
REALLY
IS
A
DECISION
THAT
IS
UP
TO
THE
PARENTS
SOME
PARENTS
USE
THE
REASONING
THAT
THEY
WILL
LOOK
LIKE
DADDY
AND
LIKE
THEIR
FRIENDS
AS
JUSTIFICATION
THERE
IS
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
THIS
JUST
BE
SURE
IT
IS
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
SINCE
IT
IS
RATHER
DIFFICULT
TO
UNCIRCUMCISE
A
MALE
ALTHOUGH
A
MAJOR
SURGICAL
PROCEDURE
EXISTS
HOW
ABOUT
THE
PREGNANT
WOMAN
SITTING
IN
A
TUB
OF
WATER
WEVE
HEARD
STORIES
OF
INFECTION
ETC
HOW
ABOUT
AFTER
THE
WATER
HAS
BROKEN
AS
LONG
AS
YOUR
MEMBRANES
HAVE
NOT
BROKEN
AND
YOU
HAVE
NOT
HAD
ANY
PROBLEMS
WITH
YOUR
PREGNANCY
IT
SHOULD
BE
OK
TO
SIT
IN
A
TUB
OF
WATER
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
RECOMMEND
USING
YOUR
OWN
BATHTUB
IN
YOUR
OWN
HOME
IT
IS
NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
GUARANTEE
THE
CLEANLINESS
AND
SAFETY
OF
PUBLIC
HOT
TUBS
A
NICE
WARM
BATH
CAN
BE
VERY
RELAXING
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOUR
BACK
IS
KILLING
YOU
AND
IT
WOULD
POSSIBLY
BE
ADVISABLE
TO
AVOID
BUBBLE
BATH
SOAP
ESP
IF
YOU
ARE
PRONE
TO
YEAST
INFECTION
HOPE
THESE
TIPS
HELP
YOU
SOME
ELISA
