thyroidal
deficiency
hi
my
wife
has
aquired
some
thyroidal
sp
deficiency
over
the
past
year
that
gives
symptoms
such
as
needing
much
sleep
coldness
and
proneness
to
gaining
weight
she
has
been
to
a
doctor
and
taken
the
ordinary
tests
and
her
values
were
regarded
as
low
the
doctor
and
my
wife
are
not
very
interested
in
starting
medication
as
this
deactivates
the
gland
giving
lifelong
dependency
to
the
drug
hormone
the
last
couple
of
monthes
she
has
been
seeing
a
hoemoepath
sp
and
been
given
some
drops
to
reactivate
either
her
thyroidal
gland
andor
the
messagecenter
in
the
brain
sorry
about
the
approximate
language
but
i
havent
got
many
clues
to
what
the
english
terms
are
but
the
brainarea
is
called
the
hypofyse
in
norwegian
my
questions
are
has
anyone
hadheard
of
success
in
using
this
approach
her
values
have
been
slowly
but
steadily
sinking
any
comment
on
the
probability
of
improvement
although
the
doctor
has
told
her
to
eat
normally
my
wife
has
dieted
vigorously
to
keep
her
weight
as
she
feels
that
is
part
of
keeping
an
edge
over
the
illnesscondition
may
this
affect
the
treatment
development
i
can
get
the
exact
figures
for
her
tests
for
anyone
interested
and
i
will
greatly
value
any
informationopinionexperience
on
this
topic
i
dont
intend
this
post
to
be
either
a
flaming
of
the
established
medical
profession
or
a
praise
for
alternatives
i
am
just
relaying
events
as
they
have
happened
sincerely
