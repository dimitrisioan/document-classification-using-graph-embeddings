WROTE
THE
SECOND
ISSUE
SUMMARIZED
HE
HAS
HAD
EXTRA
HEARTBEATS
FOR
THE
PAST
TO
YEARS
AND
ONCE
WAS
SYMPTOMATIC
FROM
THEM
WITH
SOME
LIGHTHEADEDNESS
HE
IS
YOUNG
THIN
AND
IN
GOOD
HEALTH
RECENT
BLOODTESTS
WERE
ALL
NORMAL
AND
DO
NOT
SMOKE
USE
DRUGS
OR
CAFFEINE
ETC
IM
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
EXTRA
BEATS
AS
NORMAL
BUT
DONT
WANT
TO
IGNORE
THEM
IF
THEY
MIGHT
BE
SOME
KIND
OF
WARNING
SYMPTOM
THE
NUMBER
OF
PVCS
SEEMS
TO
INCREASE
THROUGHOUT
THE
DAY
AND
WITH
EXERCISE
OR
SOMETHING
AS
SIMPLE
AS
CLIMBING
SOME
STAIRS
ALSO
IF
I
GET
UP
AFTER
SITTING
OR
LYING
DOWN
FOR
A
WHILE
I
TEND
TO
GET
A
COUPLE
OF
EXTRA
BEATS
COULD
THEY
POSSIBLY
BE
RELATED
TO
THE
ESOPHAGOUS
PROBLEMS
BOTH
SEEMED
TO
DEVELOP
AT
ABOUT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
NOT
AN
EXPERT
ON
HEART
PROBLEMS
BUT
PVCS
ARE
COMMON
AND
HAVE
BEEN
OVERTREATED
IN
THE
PAST
MY
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
AND
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
HISTORY
AN
BUILD
YOU
DO
RELATED
TO
THE
HEART
THAT
IS
IS
THAT
MY
PVCS
COME
AND
GO
WITH
SOME
MONTHS
CAUSING
ANXIETY
TAKING
ON
MORE
FLUIDS
SEEMS
TO
HELP
AND
THEY
SEEM
WORSE
IN
THE
SUMMER
REMEMBER
THAT
A
SLOW
HEART
RATE
WILL
ALLOW
MORE
PVCS
TO
BE
APPARENT
SO
PERHAPS
IT
IS
AN
INDICATION
OF
A
HEALTHY
CARDIAC
SYSTEM
BUT
ASK
AN
EXPERT
ABOUT
THAT
LAST
POINT
ESPECIALLY
I
TOO
HAVE
HAD
PREMATURE
VENTRICULAR
HEARTBEAT
STARTING
IN
THESE
ARE
NOT
BY
THE
WAY
EXTRA
HEARTBEATS
THIS
IS
HOW
THEY
FEEL
AND
THIS
IS
HOW
I
DESCRIBED
THEM
INITIALLY
TO
THE
DOCTOR
BUT
THEYRE
ACTUALLY
PREMATURE
HEARTBEATS
I
WOULD
SOMETIMES
EXPERIENCE
A
LAPSE
AFTER
ONE
OF
THESE
THAT
WENT
ON
FOR
A
SUFFOCATINGLY
LONG
PERIOD
OF
TIME
MAKING
ME
WONDER
IF
MY
HEART
WERE
EVER
GOING
TO
BEAT
AGAIN
I
HAD
THEM
PERSISTENTLY
FOR
EIGHTEEN
YEARS
THEN
I
WENT
ON
A
LOWFAT
DIET
AND
THEY
JUST
STOPPED
I
HAVENT
HAD
A
SINGLE
EPISODE
OF
PVH
FOR
ALMOST
TWO
YEARS
I
KNOW
CORRELATION
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
CAUSATION
THIS
IS
JUST
FWIW
