klonopin
and
pregnancy
a
from
adwrightiastateedu
a
a
woman
i
know
is
tapering
off
klonopin
i
believe
that
is
one
of
the
a
benzodiazopines
she
is
taking
a
very
minimal
dose
right
now
half
a
tablet
a
a
day
she
is
also
pregnant
my
question
is
are
there
any
known
cases
where
a
klonopin
or
similar
drug
has
caused
harmful
effects
to
the
fetus
a
how
about
cases
where
the
mother
took
klonopin
or
similar
substance
and
had
a
normal
baby
any
information
is
appreciated
she
wants
to
get
a
feel
for
a
what
sort
of
risk
she
is
taking
she
is
in
her
first
month
of
pregnancy
klonopin
according
to
the
pdr
physicians
desk
reference
is
not
a
proven
teratogen
there
are
isolated
case
reports
of
malformations
but
it
is
impossible
to
establish
causeeffect
relationships
the
overwhelming
majority
of
women
that
take
klonopin
while
pregnant
have
normal
babies
