RE
HOW
ABOUT
A
CRASH
PROGRAM
IN
BASIC
IMMUNOLOGICAL
RESEARCH
IN
ARTICLE
GARY
KRONK
WRITES
I
HAVE
BEEN
CONTEMPLATING
THIS
IDEA
FOR
SOME
TIME
AS
WELL
I
AM
NOT
A
DOCTOR
BUT
MY
WIFE
IS
A
NURSE
AND
I
KNOW
A
LOT
OF
DOCTORS
AND
NURSES
THE
POINT
HERE
BEING
THAT
DOCTORS
AND
NURSES
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
GET
SICK
NEARLY
AS
MUCH
AS
PEOPLE
OUTSIDE
THE
MEDICAL
PROFESSION
THIS
IS
A
LOVELY
AREA
FOR
ANECDOTES
BUT
I
AM
SURE
YOU
ARE
ON
TO
SOMETHING
AS
A
PHYSICIAN
I
ALMOST
NEVER
GET
SICK
USUALLY
WHEN
SOMETHING
HORRENDOUS
IS
GOING
AROUND
I
EITHER
DONT
GET
IT
AT
ALL
OR
GET
A
VERY
MILD
CASE
WHEN
I
DO
GET
REALLY
SICK
IT
IS
ALWAYS
SOMETHING
UNUSUAL
THIS
WAS
NOT
THE
SITUATION
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
PARTICULARLY
ON
PEDIATRICS
I
NEVER
HAD
YOUNGER
SIBLINGS
MYSELF
AND
WHEN
I
WENT
ON
THE
PEDIATRIC
WARDS
I
SUDDENLY
FOUND
MYSELF
CONFRONTING
ALL
SORTS
OF
INFECTIOUS
CHALLENGES
THAT
MY
BODY
WAS
NOT
READY
FOR
PEDIATRICS
FOR
ME
WAS
THREE
SOLID
MONTHS
OF
ILLNESS
AND
I
HAD
A
TEMP
OF
WHEN
I
TOOK
THE
FINAL
EXAM
I
THINK
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
DURING
TRAINING
AND
BEYOND
WE
ARE
CONSTANTLY
EXPOSED
TO
NEW
THINGS
AND
WE
HAVE
THE
USUAL
REACTIONS
TO
THEM
SO
THAT
LATER
ON
WHEN
CHALLENGED
WITH
SOMETHING
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
A
REEXPOSURE
FOR
US
SO
WE
DEAL
WITH
IT
WELL
AND
GET
A
MILD
ILLNESS
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
THAT
THE
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
IS
HYPED
UP
IN
ANY
WAY
ALSO
DONT
FORGET
THAT
THE
HOSPITAL
FLORA
IS
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
HOME
AND
WE
CARRY
A
LOT
OF
THAT
AROUND
KM
