NO
THE
NEISERIA
MENINGOCOCCUS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
COMMON
FORMS
OF
MENINGITIS
ITS
THE
ONE
THAT
SOMETIMES
SWEEPS
SCHOOLS
OR
BOOT
CAMP
IT
IS
CONTAGIOUS
AND
KILLS
BY
ATTACKING
THE
COVERING
OF
THE
BRAIN
CAUSING
THE
BLOOD
VESSELS
TO
THROMBOSE
AND
THE
BRAIN
TO
SWELL
UP
IT
IS
VERY
TREATABLE
IF
CAUGHT
IN
TIME
THERE
ISNT
MUCH
TIME
HOWEVER
THE
RASH
IS
THE
TIP
OFF
INFANTS

VERY
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
DYING
FROM
BACTERIAL

HAVE
ANY
CONCERNS
ABOUT
MY
WIFE

THEM
IT
CAN
LIVE
IN
THE
THROAT
OF
CARRIERS
DONT

GET
IT
FROM
THEM
ESPECIALLY
IF
THEY
TOOK
THE
MEDICATION
