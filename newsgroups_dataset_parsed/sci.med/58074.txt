RE
CANT
BREATHE
GETTING
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
IN
THIS
THREAD
I
EXPERIENCED
BREATHING
DIFFICULTIES
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
SIMILAR
TO
THOSE
DESCRIBED
IN
MY
CASE
IT
TURNED
OUT
THAT
I
WAS
DEVELOPING
TYPE
I
DIABETES
ALTHOUGH
I
NEVER
SOUGHT
DIRECT
CONFIRMATION
OF
THIS
FROM
MY
DOCTOR
I
THINK
THAT
THE
BREATHING
PROBLEM
WAS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
PRESENCE
OF
KETONES
DUE
TO
THE
DIABETES
I
THINK
THAT
KETOSIS
CAN
OCCUR
IN
LESSER
DEGREE
IF
ONE
IS
RESTRICTING
THEIR
FOOD
INTAKE
DRASTICALLY
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
RELEVANT
IN
THIS
CASE
BUT
YOU
MIGHT
ASK
YOUR
DAUGHTER
IF
SHE
HAS
BEEN
EATING
