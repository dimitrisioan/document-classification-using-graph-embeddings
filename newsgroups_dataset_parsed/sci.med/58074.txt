re
cant
breathe
getting
back
to
the
original
question
in
this
thread
i
experienced
breathing
difficulties
a
few
years
ago
similar
to
those
described
in
my
case
it
turned
out
that
i
was
developing
type
i
diabetes
although
i
never
sought
direct
confirmation
of
this
from
my
doctor
i
think
that
the
breathing
problem
was
associated
with
the
presence
of
ketones
due
to
the
diabetes
i
think
that
ketosis
can
occur
in
lesser
degree
if
one
is
restricting
their
food
intake
drastically
i
dont
know
if
this
relevant
in
this
case
but
you
might
ask
your
daughter
if
she
has
been
eating
properly
