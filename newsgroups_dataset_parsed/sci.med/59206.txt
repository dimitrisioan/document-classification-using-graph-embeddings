ANECEDOTAL
EVIDENCE
IS
WORTHLESS
EVEN
DOCTORS
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
USING
A
DRUG
OR
TREATMENT
FOR
YEARS
AND
WHO
SWEAR
IT
IS
EFFECTIVE
ARE
OFTEN
SUPRISED
AT
THE
RESULTS
OF
CLINICAL
TRIALS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
MSG
CAUSES
DESCRIBABLE
REPORTABLE
DOCUMENTABLE
SYMPTOMS
SHOULD
BE
PRETTY
SIMPLE
TO
DISCOVER
BUT
IT
IS
QUITE
A
LEAP
IN
LOGIC
TO
OBSERVE
ONE
SITUATION
WHERE
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
LED
NOWHERE
AND
THEREFORE
CONCLUDE
THAT
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
WILL
NEVER
LEAD
ANYWHERE
IM
SURE
SOMEBODY
HERE
CAN
PROVIDE
AN
EXAMPLE
WHERE
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
AND
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
IT
WAS
UPHELDVERIFIED
BY
FOLLOWON
RIGOROUS
CLINICAL
TRIALS
I
TEND
TO
DISAGREE
I
THINK
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
PROVIDED
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
IT
AND
IT
IS
FAIRLY
CONSISTENT
WILL
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
FIRST
IT
POINTS
TO
THE
NECESSITY
OF
DOING
A
STUDY
AND
SECOND
IT
AT
LEAST
SAYS
THAT
THE
EFFECTS
ARE
ALL
PSYCHOLOGICAL
OR
POSSIBLY
ALLERGY
IN
THIS
CASE
AS
IVE
POINTED
OUT
PERSONS

REALITY
GOOD
POINT
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
TENDENCY
BY
SOME
ON
THIS
NEWSGROUP
TO
CIRCLE
THE
WAGONS
TO
THE
VIEWPOINT
THAT
ANECDOTAL
MEDICAL
EVIDENCE
IS
WORTHLESS
MAYBE
TO
COUNTER
THE
CLAIMS
OF
THOSE
WHO
ARE
PRESENTING
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
CONTROVERSIAL
SUBJECTS
SUCH
AS
THE
YEAST
HYPOTHESIS
BUT
EVIDENCE
IS
EVIDENCE
IT
REQUIRES
A
JURY
OR
A
PROCESS
TO
SORT
IT
OUT
AND
DETERMINE
THE
TRUTH
FROM
THE
JUNK
MEDICINE
MUST
CONTINUE
TO
STRIVE
TO
BETTER
UNDERSTAND
THE
WORKINGS
OF
THE
BODYMIND
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ALLEVIATING
ILLNESS
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
IS
JUST
ONE
PIECE
OF
THE
PUZZLE
IT
IS
NOT
WORTHLESS
RATHER
IT
CAN
