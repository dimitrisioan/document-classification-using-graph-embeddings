i
have
a
year
old
son
that
lives
with
my
exwife
she
has
been
having
difficulty
with
his
behavior
and
has
had
him
on
ritalin
tofranil
and
now
wants
to
try
lithuim
at
the
local
doctors
suggestion
i
would
like
to
know
whatever
is
important
that
i
should
know
i
worry
about
this
sort
of
thing
and
would
like
proscons
regarding
lithium
therapy
i
get
antsy
about
posts
like
this
is
the
concern
more
for
son
or
about
exw
ife
the
standard
impartial
procedure
is
to
ask
for
a
second
opinion
about
sons
condition
then
too
is
son
acting
out
games
between
divorced
parents
precisely
one
wonders
what
unusual
strain
the
boy
might
be
under
that
could
be
causing
difficulty
with
his
behavior
standard
practice
would
be
to
get
a
second
opinion
from
a
child
psychiatrist
one
would
want
to
rule
out
the
possibility
that
the
bad
behavior
is
not
psychiatric
illness
at
all
