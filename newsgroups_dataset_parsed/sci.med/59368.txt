WRITES
I
NEED
INFORMATION
ON
THE
MEDICAL
INCLUDING
EMOTIONAL
PROS
AND
CONS
OF
CIRCUMCISION
AT
BIRTH
I
PITY
THOSE
WHO
HOPE
THAT
MEDICAL
KNOWLEDGE
CAN
RESOLVE
ISSUES
SUCH
AS
THIS
THIS
ISSUE
HAS
BEEN
REHASHED
IN
SCIMED
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
THIS
IN
NORMAL
CIRCUMSTANCES
BOTH
THE
MEDICAL
ADVANTAGES
OF
AND
THE
MEDICAL
RISKS
OF
CIRCUMCISION
ARE
MINOR
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
DECISION
IS
LEFT
TO
THE
RELIGIOUS
CULTURAL
ETHICAL
AND
AESTHETIC
MORES
OF
THE
PARENTS
AT
BEST
OR
TO
THE
HABIT
OF
THE
CONCERNED
HOSPITAL
OR
CAREGIVERS
AT
WORST
AS
PROSPECTIVE
PARENTS
YOU
SHOULD
DO
WHAT
YOU
WANT
IN
THIS
REGARD
AND
NOT
WORRY
ABOUT
IT
TOO
MUCH
IN
TERMS
OF
DECISIONS
YOU
MAKE
FOR
YOUR
CHILD
IT
WILL
HAVE
FAR
LESS
IMPORTANCE
THAN
MANY
SUCH
AS
WHICH
SCHOOLS
YOU
CHOOSE
THAT
MOST
PARENTS
THINK
ABOUT
ONLY
A
LITTLE
THIS
QUESTION
WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY
PUSH
THE
BUTTONS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
FEEL
THAT
THE
DECISION
TO
CIRCUMCISE
YOUR
INFANT
OR
NOT
IS
A
MOMENTOUS
MEDICAL
DECISION
IT
IS
NOT
RUSSELL
