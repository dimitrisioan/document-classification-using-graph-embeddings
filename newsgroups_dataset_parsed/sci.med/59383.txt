WRITES
ISNT
THERE
A
RELATIVELY
NEW
TREATMENT
FOR
KIDNEY
STONES
INVOLVING
A
NONINVASIVE
USE
OF
ULTRASOUND
WHERE
THE
PATIENT
IS
LOWERED
INTO
SOME
SORT
OF
LIQUID
WHEN
HESHE
UNDERGOES
TREATMENT
IM
SURE
IVE
READ
ABOUT
IT
SOMEWHERE
IF
I
REMEMBER
IT
CORRECTLY
IT
IS
A
PAINLESS
AND
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
AGO
I
VISITED
A
HOSPITAL
HERE
IN
STOCKHOLM
AND
SAW
BIG
SIGNS
SHOWING
THE
WAY
TO
THE
KIDNEY
STONE
CHRUSHER
I
SAW
THIS
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
ON
TOMORROWS

PROGRAM
THE
PATIENT
IS
LOWERED
INTO
A
BATH
OF
DEIONIZED
WATER
AND
CAREFULLY
POSITIONED
HIGH
INTENSITY
PRESSURE
WAVES
ARE
GENERATED
BY
AN
ELECTRIC
SPARK
IN
THE
WATER
YOU
DONT
GET
ELECTROCUTED
BECAUSE
DEIONISED
WATER
DOES
NOT
CONDUCT
THESE
WAVES
ARE
FOCUSED
ON
THE
KIDNEYS
BY
A
PARABOLIC
REFLECTOR
AND
CAUSE
THE
STONE
TO
BREAK
UP
THIS
IS
COMPLETELY
PAINLESS
OF
COURSE
YOU
THEN
HAVE
TO
GET
THESE
LITTLE
BITS
OF
GRAVEL
THROUGH
THE
URETHRA
