my
new
diet

works
great

keith
is
the
only
person
i
have
ever
heard
of
that
keeps
the
weight
off
without
any
conscious
effort
to
control
eating
behavior
most
of
us
have
to
diet
a
lot
to
keep
from
going
back
to
morbid
obesity
i
attribute
my
success
to
several
factors
very
low
fat
except
when
someone
else
has
cooked
a
meal
for
me
i
only
eat
fruit
vegetables
and
whole
grain
or
bran
cereals
i
estimate
i
only
get
about
to
percent
of
my
calories
from
fat
very
little
sugar
or
salt
very
high
fiber
most
americans
get
about
grams
to
are
recommended
i
get
between
and
sometimes
ive
heard
of
people
taking
fiber
pills
it
seems
unlikely
that
pills
can
contain
enough
fiber
to
make
a
difference
it
would
be
about
as
likely
as
someone
getting
fat
by
popping
fat
pills
tablets
are
just
too
small
unless
you
snarf
down
hundreds
of
them
daily
my
clean
your
plate
conditioning
works
for
me
eating
the
last
takes
half
my
eating
time
and
gives
satiety
a
chance
to
catch
up
so
i
dont
still
feel
hungry
and
go
start
eating
something
else
i
dont
eat
when
im
not
hungry
unless
im
sure
ill
get
hungry
shortly
and
eating
wont
be
practical
then
i
bike
to
work
miles
a
day
year
round
fast
i
also
bike
to
stores
movies
and
everywhere
else
as
ive
never
owned
a
car
i
estimate
this
burns
about
calories
a
day
it
also
helps
build
and
maintain
muscle
mass
prevent
insulin
resistance
diabetes
runs
in
my
family
and
increase
my
metabolism
even
so
my
metabolism
is
so
low
that
when
im
at
rest
im
most
comfortable
with
a
temperature
in
the
f
and
usually
wear
a
sweater
if
it
drops
to
cycling
also
motivates
me
to
avoid
every
excess
ounce
cyclists
routinely
pay
a
premium
for
cycling
products
that
weigh
slightly
less
than
others
but
its
easier
and
cheaper
to
trim
weight
from
the
rider
than
from
the
vehicle
theres
no
question
in
my
mind
that
my
metabolism
is
radically
different
from
that
of
most
people
who
have
never
been
fat
fortunately
it
isnt
different
in
a
way
that
precludes
excellent
health
obviously
i
cant
swear
that
every
obese
person
who
does
what
ive
done
will
have
the
success
i
did
but
ive
never
yet
heard
of
one
who
did
try
it
and
didnt
succeed
i
think
all
of
us
cycle
ones
success
depends
on
how
large
the
fluctuations
in
the
cycle
are
some
people
can
cycle
only
pounds
im
sure
everyones
weight
cycles
whether
or
not
theyve
ever
been
fat
i
usually
eat
extremely
little
salt
when
i
do
eat
something
salty
my
weight
can
increase
overnight
by
as
much
as
ten
pounds
it
comes
off
again
over
a
week
or
two
