my
wife
cannot
donate
blood
because
she
has
been
to
a
malarial
region
in
the
past
three
years
in
fact
she
tried
to
have
her
bone
marrow
typed
and
they
wouldnt
even
do
that
why
the
fda
i
believe
rules
say
no
blood
or
blood
products
donations
from
anyone
who
has
been
in
a
malarial
area
for
years
i
was
a
platelet
donor
until
my
thailand
trip
and
my
blood
bank
was
very
disappointed
to
find
out
they
couldnt
use
me
for
years
when
the
secretary
of
state
asked
me
if
i
wanted
to
donate
my
organs
i
said
no
because
i
figured
that
no
one
would
want
them
given
my
history
was
i
correct
not
necessarily
the
same
rules
may
not
apply
to
organ
donation
as
to
blood
donation
in
fact
im
sure
they
dont
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
gebcadredslpittedu
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
