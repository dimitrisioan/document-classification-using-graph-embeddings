SUSAN
WRITES
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
HAS
A
VERY
SEVERE
CAUSE
OF
JIGGERS
FOR
OVER
A
YEAR
NOW
THEY
CAUSE
HIM
A
LOT
OF
PAIN
I
RECENTLY
READ
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
ABOUT
A
POSSIBLE
CURE
FOR
JIGGERS
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
INFORMATION
ON
THIS
I
CANT
REMEMBER
THE
NAME
OF
THE
TREATMENT
OR
WHERE
I
READ
IT
ILL
PROBABLY
GET
FLAMED
FOR
THIS
BUT
WHEN
I
WAS
A
KID
WE
WOULD
GO
TO
MY
UNCLES
CABIN
ON
MIDDLE
BASS
ISLAND
ON
LAKE
ERIE
WE
ALWAYS
CAME
HOME
WITH
A
NASTY
CASE
OF
JIGGERS
LARGE
RED
BUMPS
WHERE
THE
BUGGERS
HAD
BURROWED
INTO
THE
SKIN
MY
MOTHER
WOULD
PAINT
THE
BUMPS
WITH
CLEAR
FINGER
NAIL
POLISH
THIS
WAS
REPEATED
DAILY
FOR
ABOUT
A
WEEK
OR
SO
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
POLISH
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
SUFFOCATE
THEM
AS
IT
SEALS
OF
THE
SKIN
ALL
I
CAN
SAY
IS
IT
WORKED
FOR
US
ONE
WORD
OF
CAUTION
THOUGH
PUTTING
FINGER
NAIL
POLISH
ON
A
JIGGER
BITE
STINGS
LIKE
HELL
IF
I
DO
GET
FLAMED
FOR
THIS
JUST
PUT
JAM
IN
MY
POCKETS
AND
CALL
ME
