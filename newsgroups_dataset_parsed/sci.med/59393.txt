WRITES
ISNT
THERE
A
RELATIVELY
NEW
TREATMENT
FOR
KIDNEY
STONES
INVOLVING
A
NONINVASIVE
USE
OF
ULTRASOUND
WHERE
THE
PATIENT
IS
LOWERED
INTO
SOME
SORT
OF
LIQUID
WHEN
HESHE
UNDERGOES
TREATMENT
IM
SURE
IVE
READ
ABOUT
IT
SOMEWHERE
IF
I
REMEMBER
IT
CORRECTLY
IT
IS
A
PAINLESS
AND
EFFECTIVE
TREATMENT
THE
USE
OF
SHOCK
WAVES
NOT
ULTRASOUND
TO
BREAK
UP
STONES
HAS
BEEN
AROUND
FOR
A
FEW
YEARS
DEPENDING
ON
THE
TYPE
OF
MACHINE
AND
INTENSITY
OF
THE
SHOCK
WAVES

ANESTHESIA

FEELS
LIKE
SOMEONE
SLUGGED
