this
isnt
the
first
time
that
ive
had
a
migraine
occur
after
exercise
im
wondering
if
anyone
else
has
had
the
same
experience
and
i
wonder
what
triggers
the
migraine
in
this
situation
heat
buildup
dehydration
im
not
giving
up
tennis
so
is
there
anything
i
can
do
besides
get
into
shape
and
dont
play
at
high
noon
to
prevent
this
ive
gotten
migraines
after
exercise
though
for
me
it
seems
to
be
related
to
exercising
without
having
eaten
recently
