re
migraines
and
scans
dn

david

a
neurology
dn
consultation
is
cheaper
than
a
scan
and
also
better
because
a
neurologist
can
make
a
differential
diagnosis
between
migraine
tensiontype
headache
cluster
benign
intracranial
hypertension
chronic
paroxysmal
hemicrania
and
other
headache
syndromes
that
all
appear
normal
on
a
scan
a
neurologist
can
also
recommend
a
course
of
treatment
that
is
appropriate
to
the
diagnosis
dn
also
since
many
people
are
convinced
they
have
brain
tumors
or
other
dn
serious
pathology
it
may
be
cheaper
to
just
get
a
ct
scan
then
have
dn
them
come
into
the
er
every
few
weeks
dn
and
easier
than
taking
the
time
to
reassure
the
patient
right
dn
personally
i
dont
think
this
can
ever
be
justified
sigh
it
may
never
be
justifiable
but
i
sometimes
do
it
even
after
i
try
to
show
thoroughness
with
a
detailed
history
neurologic
examination
and
discussion
with
the
patient
about
my
diagnosis
salted
with
lots
of
reassurance
patients
still
ask
why
cant
you
order
a
scan
so
we
can
be
absolutely
sure
aunt
millie
often
gets
into
the
conversation
as
in
they
ignored
aunt
millies
headaches
for
years
and
then
she
died
of
a
brain
tumor
aneurysm
or
whatever
if
you
can
get
away
without
ever
ordering
imaging
for
a
patient
with
an
obviously
benign
headache
syndrome
id
like
to
hear
what
your
magic
is
every
once
in
a
while
i
am
able
to
bypass
imaging
by
getting
an
eeg
mind
you
i
dont
think
eeg
is
terribly
sensitive
for
brain
tumor
but
the
patient
feels
like
something
is
being
done
as
if
the
hours
i
spent
talking
with
and
examining
the
patient
were
nothing
the
eeg
has
no
ionizing
radiation
its
much
cheaper
than
ct
or
mri
and
the
eeg
brings
in
some
money
to
my
department
