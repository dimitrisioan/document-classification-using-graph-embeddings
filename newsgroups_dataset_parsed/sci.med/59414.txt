DEFINITELY
INTENDED
HERE
BILL
WAS
MAKING
FUN
OF
THE
MISSPELLING
GO
LOOK
UP
THE
WORD
KRILL
ALSO
THE
CORRECT
SPELLING
IS
KIRLIAN
IT
INVOLVES
TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
CORONA
DISCHARGES
CREATED
BY
ATTACHING
THE
SUBJECT
TO
A
HIGHVOLTAGE
SOURCE
NOT
OF
SOME
AURA
IT
WORKS
EQUALLY
WELL
WITH
INANIMATE
OBJECTS
TRUE
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
SHOWING
THE
MISSING
PART
OF
A
LEAF
IS
THIS
CORONA
DISCHARGE
I
THINK
I
CAN
EXPLAIN
THE
MISSING
PART
OF
A
LEAF
STORY
I
HAVE
ACTUALLY
SEEN
A
REPRODUCTION
OF
THAT
PARTICULAR
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPH
IN
A
BOOK
COMPILED
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
ENTHUSIASTS
OF
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
THAT
PARTICULAR
PHOTOGRAPH
THATS
RIGHT
THE
EFFECT
HAS
BEEN
OBSERVED
ONLY
ONCE
EVEN
THE
WRITERS
OF
THE
BOOK
WERE
INCLINED
TO
DISBELIEVE
IN
IT
I
CONJECTURE
THAT
THE
MAKER
OF
THAT
PHOTOGRAPH
BEGAN
BY
PLACING
A
WHOLE
LEAF
BETWEEN
TWO
PLATES
AND
TAKING
ITS
KIRLIAN
PHOTO
FOR
HIS
NEXT
EXPERIMENT
HE
CUT
THE
LEAF
IN
HALF
PUT
ONE
HALF
DOWN
BETWEEN
THE
SAME
TWO
PLATES
AND
TOOK
ANOTHER
K
P
THE
MISSING
HALF
EFFECT
WAS
CREATED
BY
WATER
OILS
ETC
LEFT
BEHIND
AFTER
THE
FIRST
PHOTO
THIS
EXPLANATION
MUST
BE
TENTATIVE
BECAUSE
AFTER
ALL
I
WASNT
THERE
WHEN
IT
HAPPENED
