RE
ANTIVIRAL
HERBS
KENNETH
GILBERT
WRITES
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
WAS
RATHER
POORLY
RESEARCHED
AND
WOULD
NOT
BE
AVAILABLE
TODAY
IF
IT
WERE
JUST
INVENTED
KEEP
IN
MIND
HOWEVER
THAT
THOSE
WERE
THE
DAYS
WHEN
A
BOTTLE
OF
COCA
COLA
REALLY
DID
CONTAIN
COCA
EXTRACT
AND
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
ACTIVE
COCAINE
TIMES
HAVE
CHANGED
AND
OUR
ATTITUDES
NEED
TO
CHANGE
WITH
THEM
WELL
YES
THAT
WAS
A
PART
OF
MY
POINT
ASPIRIN
HAS
ITS
PROBLEMS
BUT
IN
SOME
SITUATIONS
IT
IS
USEFUL
DITTO
STUFF
LIKE
LICORICE
ROOT
TAKING
ANYTHING
AS
A
DRUG
FOR
THERAPUTIC
PURPOSES
IMPLICITLY
CARRIES
THE
IDEA
OF
TAKING
A
DOSE
WHERE
THE
BENEFITS
ARE
NOT
EXCEEDED
BY
ANY
UNWANTED
ADDITIONAL
EFFECTS
TAKING
ANY
DRUG
WHEN
THE
POTENTIAL
ILLEFFECTS
ARE
NOT
KNOWN
IS
A
RISK
ASSUMED
BY
THE
PARTIES
INVOLVED
AND
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
IN
A
GIVEN
SITUATION
THE
RISK
IS
WORTHWHILE
LIKE
PROZAC
FOR
INSTANCE
PROZAC
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
BE
THERAPUTIC
IN
SOME
CASES
WHERE
THE
TRICYCLICS
FAIL
BUT
PROZAC
HASNT
BEEN
IN
USE
THAT
LONG
AND
IT
REALLY
ISNT
CLEAR
WHAT
IF
ANY
EFFECTS
IT
MAY
HAVE
WHEN
TAKEN
OVER
LONG
PERIODS
OF
TIME
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
HAS
BEEN
TESTED
BY
PRESENT
DAY
STANDARDS
SHOULD
PROZAC
BE
TAKEN
OFF
THE
MARKET
BECAUSE
LONGTERM
EFFECTS
IF
ANY
ARE
NOT
KNOWN
IMHO
ID
SAY
NO

EUCLID
K
STANDARD
DISCLAIMERS
APPLY
IT
IS
A
BIT
IRONIC
THAT
WE
NEED
THE

TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
PROPAGATION
OF

ONLY
THROUGH
THAT
PART
OF
