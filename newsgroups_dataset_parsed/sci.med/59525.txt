does
anyone
know
of
any
studies
done
on
the
longterm
health
effects
of
a
mans
vasectomy
on
his
female
partner
ive
seen
plenty
of
study
results
about
vasectomys
effects
on
mens
health
but
what
about
women
for
example
might
the
wife
of
a
vasectomized
man
become
more
at
risk
for
say
cervical
cancer
adverse
effects
from
sperm
antibodies
changes
in
the
vaginas
ph
yeast
or
bacterial
infections
outside
of
study
results
how
about
informed
speculation
ive
heard
of
no
studies
but
speculation
why
on
earth
would
there
be
any
effect
on
womens
health
thats
about
the
most
absurd
idea
ive
heard
since
ted
kaldiss
claim
that
no
more
than
people
would
march
on
washington
ok
one
point
greatly
reduced
chance
of
pregnancy
but
thats
it
