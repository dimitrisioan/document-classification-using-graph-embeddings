IN

IT
IS
SOMEWHAT

THAT
WHEN
ANYONE
IS
CHALLANGED
TO
PROVIDE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THIS
SORT
THE
ONLY
ONE
THEY
COME
UP
WITH
IS
THE
ONE
ABOUT
KEKULE
SURELY
THERE
MUST
BE
OTHERS
BUT
APPARENTLY
THIS
IS
REGARDED
AS
AN
EXTREME
EXAMPLE
OF
A
NONRATIONAL
PROCESS
IN
SCIENCE
WHEREBY
A
SUCCESSFUL
HYPOTHESIS
WAS
PROPOSED
BUT
HOW
NONRATIONAL
IS
IT
INDEED
AN
EXTREME
EXAMPLE
IT
CAME
OUT
OF
NOWHERE
THE
CONNECTION
KEKULE
SAW
BETWEEN
IT
AND

FORTUNATE

THESE

ARE
NOT
THE

MY
CONNECTING
