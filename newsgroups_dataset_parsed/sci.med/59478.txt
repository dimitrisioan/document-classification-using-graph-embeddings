THE
LIST
IS
GROWING
NICELY
ITS
AMAZING
TO
SEE
JUST
HOW
MUCH
WAS
DISCOVERED
BY
CANADIANS
ACTUALLY
THERE
ARE
MANY
MORE
WHO
WERE
BORN
IN
CANADA
BUT
BECAME
AMERICANS
AFTER
GRADUATE
SCHOOL
PLEASE
NOTE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
NOMINATED
ALEXANDER
GRAHAM
BELL
BUT
I
FEEL
HE
WAS
REALLY
A
SCOTTISHAMERICAN
WITH
A
SUMMER
HOME
IN
CANADA
NOW
I
KNOW
THIS
IS
DEBATABLE
BUT
PLEASE
DONT
NOMINATE
HIM
AGAIN
IF
ANYONE
CAN
FILL
IN
SOME
OF
THE
QUESTION
MARKS
ON
THE
LIST
PLEASE
DROP
ME
A
LINE
THAT
WAS
TWO
YEARS
AGO
SINCE
THEN
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
A
GRANT
FROM
SCIENCE
CULTURE
CANADA
A
DIVISION
OF
SUPPLY
AND
SERVICES
CANADA
TO
RESEARCH
THE
BOOK
SINCE
MY
OLD
POSTING
THE
BOOK
HAS
EVOLVED
INTO
AN
EDUCATIONAL
BOOK
FOR
KIDS
AGED
THOUGH
THIS
MAY
CHANGE
AGAIN
IT
WILL
HAVE
ABOUT
TWOPAGE
SPREADS
WITH
A
LARGE
GRAPHIC
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AND
TEXTGRAPHIC
BOXES
ALL
AROUND
ON
THE
FOLLOWING
SUBJECTS
VITAL
STATISTICS
AND
PHOTO
OF
THE
SCIENTIST
PERSONAL
STATEMENT
FROM
THE
SCIENTIST
NARRATIVE
OF
A
FEW
MOMENTS
IN
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
SCIENTIST
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING
WHEN
I
WAS
SO
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
A
INSERT
KIND
OF
SCIENTIST
EXPERIMENT
YOU
CAN
DO
THERE
WILL
BE
AN
APPENDIX
WITH
MORE
SCIENTISTS
WITH
ONE
PARAGRAPH
BIOGRAPHIES
WHO
DIDNT
QUITE
MAKE
IT
TO
THE
DOUBLE
SPREADS
THE
WHOLE
THING
WILL
THEN
BE
PUBLISHED
ON
CDROM
WITH
VIDEO
AND
SOUND
CLIPS
FOR
ADDED
RICHNESS
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
A
CDROM
PUBLISHER
AS
WELL
THE
TEXT
PART
MAY
ALSO
BE
AVAILABLE
ON
THE
CANARIE
ELECTRONIC
HIGHWAY
BEING
DEVELOPED
IN
CANADA
AS
WELL
I
AM
STILL
LOOKING
FOR
A
PUBLISHER
THOUGH
PENGUIN
CANADA
CAME
CLOSE
TO
BEING
IT
HOPE
TO
FIND
ONE
SOON
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
AGAIN
ASK
FOR
MORE
NOMINATIONS
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
PURE
SCIENCES
OF
PHYSICS
CHEMISTRY
AND
BIOLOGY
ALSO
CRITICISMS
OF
THE
LIST
ARE
WELCOMED
ALSO
WOMEN
AND
FRENCHCANADIAN
SCIENTISTS
ARE
NEEDED
I
HOPE
THIS
POSTING
WILL
GET
OTHERS
TO
NOMINATE
MORE
GREAT
CANADIAN
SCIENTISTS
AND
TO
DISCUSS
WHAT
IS
GREAT
WHAT
IS
CANADIAN
AND
WHAT
IS
SCIENTIST
