there
has
been
no

info
provided
about
msg
making
people
ill
thats
the
point
after
all
why
dont
you
just
look
it
up
in
the
merk
or
check
out
the
medical
dictionary
cite
which
a
doctor
mentioned
earlier
in
this
thread
thats
because
these
peerreviewed
studies
are
not
addressing
the
effects
of
msg
in
people
theyre
looking
at
animal
models
you
cant
walk
away
from
this
and
start
ranting
about
gloom
and
doom
as
if
there
were
any
documented
deleterious
health
effects
demonstrated
in
humans
note
that
i
wouldnt
have
any
argument
with
a
statement
like
noting
that
animal
administration
has
pro
duced
the
following
blah
blah
we
must
be
careful
about
its
use
in
humans
this
is
precisely
not
what
you
said
among
others
see
olneys
excitotoxic
food
aditives
relevance
of
animal
studies
to
human
safety
neurobehav
toxicol
teratol
vol
im
sure
peta
would
love
to
hear
your
arguments
tests
have
been
done
on
rhesus
monkeys
as
well
i
have
never
seen
a
study
where
the
mode
of
administration
was
intraventricular
the
glu
and
asp
were
administered
orally
some
studies
used
iv
and
sc
intraventricular
is
not
a
normal
admin
method
for
food
tox
studies
for
obvious
reasons
you
must
not
have
read
the
peerreviewed
works
that
i
referred
to
or
you
would
never
have
come
up
with
this
brain
injection
bunk
it
most
certainly
is
for
neurotoxicology
you
know
studies
of
glutamate
involve
more
than
food
science
whose
talking
about
food
science
what
is
this
comment
supposed
to
mean
neurotoxicology
and
tratology
brain
research
nature
progress
in
brain
research
all
fine
food
science
journals
pardon
me
but
where
are
you
getting
this
from
have
you
read
the
journals
have
you
done
a
thorough
literature
search
so
point
us
to
the
studies
in
humans
please
im
familiar
with
the
literature
and
ive
never
seen
any
which
relate
at
all
to
olneys
work
in
animals
and
the
effects
of
glutamate
on
neurons
then
you
would
know
that
olney
himself
has
casually
referred
to
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
in
a
few
articles
why
dont
you
point
us
to
some
studies
maybe
then
this
exchange
could
be
productive
the
point
is
exceeding
the
window
of
course
theyre
amino
acids
note
that
people
with
pku
cannot
tolerate
any
phenylalanine
well
actually
they
have
to
tolerate
some
phenylalanine
its
a
essential
amino
acid
they
just
try
to
get
as
little
as
is
healthy
without
producing
dangerous
levels
of
phenylalanine
and
its
metabolites
in
the
blood
theyre
unable
to
metabolise
it
olneys
research
compared
infant
human
diets
specifically
the
amount
of
freely
available
glu
in
mothers
milk
versus
commercial
baby
foods
vs
typical
lunch
items
from
the
standard
american
diet
such
as
packaged
soup
mixes
he
found
that
one
could
exceed
the
projected
safety
margin
for
infant
humans
by
at
least
fourfold
in
a
single
meal
of
processed
foods
mothers
milk
was
well
below
the
effective
dose
goodness
im
not
saying
that
its
good
to
feed
infants
a
lot
of
glutamatesupplemented
foods
its
just
that
this
projected
safety
margin
is
a
construct
derived
from
animal
models
and
given
that
you
can
prove
anything
you
like
were
talking
prudent
policy
in
infant
nutrition
here
yet
youre
misrepresenting
it
as
received
wisdom
who
said
anything
about
received
wisdom
there
is
no
question
that
orally
administered
doses
of
msg
are
capable
of
destroying
nearly
all
neurons
in
the
arcuate
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
and
the
median
eminence
these
areas
are
responsible
for
the
production
of
hormones
critical
to
normal
neuroendocrine
function
and
the
normal
development
of
the
vertabrate
organism
humans
are
vertebrates
now
what
pray
tell
do
you
think
will
happen
when
the
area
of
the
brain
necessary
for
the
normal
rhythm
of
gonadotropin
release
is
missing
are
you
trying
to
say
that
humans
have
no
need
of
their
pituitary
anh
and
me
of
that
part
of
the
brain
that
is
responsible
for
controlling
the
realease
albeit
indirectly
of
estradiol
and
testosterone
how
do
you
expect
anyone
to
do
the
studies
on
this
its
unethical
to
sacrifice
humans
to
check
out
what
effects
chronic
acute
etc
doses
of
these
compounds
are
having
on
the
brain
tissue
in
humans
the
food
industry
knows
this
thats
why
the
animal
model
is
used
in
medicine
and
psych
if
youre
talking
about
straight
sensitivity
it
would
be
useful
to
define
the
term
there
are
plenty
of
studies
on
psychoneuroimmunology
showing
the
link
between
attitude
and
physiology
i
suspect
we
may
be
arguing
about
separate
things
only
adult
sensitivities
you
and
lateoccuring
sequelae
of
childhood
ingestion
and
its
implication
for
adults
me
certainly
the
doses
for
excitotoxicity
in
adults
are
considerably
larger
than
for
the
young
but
the
additivity
of
glu
and
asp
and
their
copious
and
increased
presence
in
modern
processed
foods
jointly
and
their
hidden
presence
in
hvp
necessitates
extreme
caution
why
would
anyone
want
to
eat
compounds
which
have
been
shown
to
markedly
perturb
the
endocrine
system
in
adults
the
main
point
is
blood
levels
attained
and
oral
doses
would
likely
have
to
be
greater
than
sc
between
who
over
what
i
would
be
most
interested
in
seeing
you
provide
peerreviewed
nonfoodindustryfunded
citations
to
articles
disputing
that
msg
has
no
effects
whatsoever
you
mean
asserting
youre
being
intellectually
dishonest
or
just
plain
confused
because
youre
conflating
reports
which
do
not
necessarily
have
anything
to
do
with
each
other
olneys
reports
would
argue
a
potential
for
problems
in
human
infants
but
thats
not
to
say
that
this
says
anything
whatsoever
about
the
use
of
msg
in
most
foods
nor
does
he
provide
any
studies
in
humans
which
indicate
any
deleterious
effects
for
obvious
reasons
it
says
nothing
about
msgs
contribtion
to
the
phenomenon
of
the
chinese
restaurant
syndrome
it
says
nothing
about
the
frequent
inability
to
replicate
anecdotal
reports
of
msg
sensitivity
in
the
lab
olneys
work
provides
a
putative
causal
mechanism
for
some
sensitivities
terry
epelbaum
and
martin
have
shown
that
orally
administered
msg
causes
changes
in
normal
gonadotropic
hormone
fluctutations
in
adults
glu
also
was
found
to
induce
immediate
and
persistant
supression
of
rhythmic
gh
secretion
and
to
induce
rapid
and
transient
release
of
prolactin
in
adults
chronically
exposed
to
msg
gh
is
responsible
not
only
for
control
of
growth
during
development
but
also
converts
glycogen
into
glucose
could
this
be
the
cause
of
headaches
i
dont
know

hmm
com
why

probably
one
of
the
dumber
remarks
youve
made
if
you
had
read
olneys
review
article
especially
the
remarks
i
already
quoted
in
an
earlier

you
would
know
to
what
i
was
alluding
may
i
ask
exactly
for
whom
you
