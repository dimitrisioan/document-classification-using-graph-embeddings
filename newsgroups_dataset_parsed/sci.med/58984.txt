THERE
HAS
BEEN
NO
HARD
INFO
PROVIDED
ABOUT
MSG
MAKING
PEOPLE
ILL
THATS
THE
POINT
AFTER
ALL
WHY
DONT
YOU
JUST
LOOK
IT
UP
IN
THE
MERK
OR
CHECK
OUT
THE
MEDICAL
DICTIONARY
CITE
WHICH
A
DOCTOR
MENTIONED
EARLIER
IN
THIS
THREAD
THATS
BECAUSE
THESE
PEERREVIEWED
STUDIES
ARE
NOT
ADDRESSING
THE
EFFECTS
OF
MSG
IN
PEOPLE
THEYRE
LOOKING
AT
ANIMAL
MODELS
YOU
CANT
WALK
AWAY
FROM
THIS
AND
START
RANTING
ABOUT
GLOOM
AND
DOOM
AS
IF
THERE
WERE
ANY
DOCUMENTED
DELETERIOUS
HEALTH
EFFECTS
DEMONSTRATED
IN
HUMANS
NOTE
THAT
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
ANY
ARGUMENT
WITH
A
STATEMENT
LIKE
NOTING
THAT
ANIMAL
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
PRO
DUCED
THE
FOLLOWING
BLAH
BLAH
WE
MUST
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
ITS
USE
IN

THIS
IS
PRECISELY
NOT

IM
SURE
PETA
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HEAR
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
TESTS
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
ON
RHESUS
MONKEYS
AS
WELL
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
STUDY
WHERE
THE
MODE
OF
ADMINISTRATION
WAS
INTRAVENTRICULAR
THE
GLU
AND

WERE
ADMINISTERED
ORALLY
SOME

USED
IV
AND
SC
INTRAVENTRICULAR
IS
NOT
A
NORMAL
ADMIN
METHOD
FOR

TOX

FOR
OBVIOUS
REASONS
YOU
MUST
NOT
HAVE
READ
THE
PEERREVIEWED
WORKS
THAT
I
REFERRED
TO
OR
YOU
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
COME
UP
WITH
THIS
BRAIN
INJECTION
BUNK
IT
MOST
CERTAINLY
IS
FOR
NEUROTOXICOLOGY
YOU
KNOW

OF

INVOLVE
MORE
THAN

WHOSE

JOURNALS
PARDON
ME
BUT
WHERE
ARE
YOU
GETTING
THIS
FROM
HAVE
YOU
READ
THE
JOURNALS
HAVE
YOU
DONE
A
THOROUGH
LITERATURE
SEARCH
SO
POINT
US
TO
THE

IN
HUMANS
PLEASE
IM
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
LITERATURE
AND
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANY
WHICH
RELATE
AT
ALL
TO
OLNEYS
WORK
IN
ANIMALS
AND
THE
EFFECTS
OF
GLUTAMATE
ON
NEURONS
THEN
YOU
WOULD
KNOW
THAT
OLNEY
HIMSELF
HAS
CASUALLY
REFERRED
TO
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
SYNDROME
IN
A
FEW
ARTICLES
WHY
DONT
YOU
POINT
US
TO
SOME
STUDIES
MAYBE
THEN
THIS
EXCHANGE
COULD
BE
PRODUCTIVE
THE
POINT
IS
EXCEEDING
THE
WINDOW
OF
COURSE
THEYRE
AMINO
ACIDS
NOTE
THAT
PEOPLE
WITH
PKU
CANNOT
TOLERATE
ANY
PHENYLALANINE
WELL
ACTUALLY
THEY
HAVE
TO
TOLERATE
SOME
PHENYLALANINE
ITS
A
ESSENTIAL
AMINO
ACID
THEY
JUST
TRY
TO
GET
AS
LITTLE
AS
IS
HEALTHY
WITHOUT
PRODUCING
DANGEROUS
LEVELS
OF
PHENYLALANINE
AND
ITS
METABOLITES
IN
THE

THEYRE
UNABLE
TO
METABOLISE
IT

BY

OF

MOTHERS

WAS

BELOW

IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
ITS
GOOD
TO

INFANTS
A

OF

ITS
JUST
THAT
THIS

IS
A

DERIVED
FROM

THAT
YOU

YOU

HERE
YET
YOURE
MISREPRESENTING
IT
AS

WISDOM
WHO
SAID
ANYTHING
ABOUT

THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
ORALLY
ADMINISTERED
DOSES
OF
MSG
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
DESTROYING
NEARLY
ALL
NEURONS
IN
THE
ARCUATE
NUCLEUS
OF
THE
HYPOTHALAMUS
AND
THE
MEDIAN
EMINENCE
THESE
AREAS
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
HORMONES
CRITICAL
TO
NORMAL
NEUROENDOCRINE
FUNCTION
AND
THE
NORMAL
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
VERTABRATE
ORGANISM
HUMANS
ARE
VERTEBRATES
NOW
WHAT
PRAY

DO
YOU
THINK
WILL
HAPPEN
WHEN
THE
AREA
OF
THE
BRAIN
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
NORMAL
RHYTHM
OF
GONADOTROPIN
RELEASE
IS
MISSING
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
HUMANS
HAVE
NO
NEED
OF
THEIR
PITUITARY
ANH
AND
ME
OF
THAT
PART
OF
THE
BRAIN
THAT
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
CONTROLLING
THE
REALEASE
ALBEIT
INDIRECTLY
OF
ESTRADIOL
AND
TESTOSTERONE
HOW
DO
YOU
EXPECT
ANYONE
TO
DO
THE
STUDIES
ON
THIS
ITS
UNETHICAL
TO
SACRIFICE
HUMANS
TO
CHECK
OUT
WHAT
EFFECTS
CHRONIC
ACUTE
ETC
DOSES
OF
THESE
COMPOUNDS
ARE
HAVING
ON
THE
BRAIN
TISSUE
IN
HUMANS
THE
FOOD
INDUSTRY
KNOWS
THIS
THATS
WHY
THE
ANIMAL
MODEL
IS
USED
IN
MEDICINE
AND
PSYCH
IF
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
STRAIGHT
SENSITIVITY
IT
WOULD
BE
USEFUL
TO
DEFINE
THE
TERM
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
STUDIES
ON
PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY
SHOWING
THE
LINK
BETWEEN
ATTITUDE
AND
PHYSIOLOGY
I
SUSPECT
WE
MAY
BE
ARGUING
ABOUT

ONLY
ADULT

YOU
AND
LATEOCCURING
SEQUELAE
OF

AND
ITS

FOR

ME
CERTAINLY
THE
DOSES
FOR
EXCITOTOXICITY
IN

ARE
CONSIDERABLY
LARGER
THAN
FOR

BUT
THE
ADDITIVITY
OF
GLU

AND
THEIR
COPIOUS
AND
INCREASED
PRESENCE
IN
MODERN

JOINTLY
AND
THEIR

NECESSITATES
EXTREME

WHY

ANYONE
WANT
TO

WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
SHOWN

PERTURB
THE

SYSTEM
IN

THE
MAIN

IS

WOULD
LIKELY
HAVE
TO
BE
GREATER
THAN

BETWEEN
WHO
OVER
WHAT
I
WOULD
BE
MOST
INTERESTED
IN
SEEING
YOU
PROVIDE
PEERREVIEWED
NONFOODINDUSTRYFUNDED
CITATIONS
TO

DISPUTING
THAT
MSG
HAS
NO

WHATSOEVER
YOU
MEAN
ASSERTING
YOURE
BEING
INTELLECTUALLY
DISHONEST
OR
JUST
PLAIN
CONFUSED
BECAUSE
YOURE
CONFLATING

NOT
NECESSARILY
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
EACH
OTHER
OLNEYS
REPORTS
WOULD
ARGUE
A
POTENTIAL
FOR

IN

INFANTS
BUT
THATS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
SAYS
ANYTHING
WHATSOEVER
ABOUT
THE
USE
OF
MSG
IN
MOST
FOODS
NOR
DOES
HE
PROVIDE
ANY

IN

WHICH
INDICATE
ANY

FOR
OBVIOUS

IT
SAYS
NOTHING
ABOUT
MSGS
CONTRIBTION
TO
THE
PHENOMENON
OF
THE

IT
SAYS
NOTHING
ABOUT
THE
FREQUENT
INABILITY
TO

ANECDOTAL

OF

SENSITIVITY
IN

OLNEYS
