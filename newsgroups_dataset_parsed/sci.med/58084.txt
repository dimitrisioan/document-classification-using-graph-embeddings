RE
CONTRACEPTIVE
PILL
JECWATSONIBMCOM
WROTE
A
VERY
SIMPLE
QUESTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
CONTRACEPTIVE
PILL
JUST
PREVENTS
THE
OVULE
TO
NEST
IN
THE
VAGINA
AND
FORCES
IT
TO
FALL
EVERY
MONTH
BUT
IT
DOES
NOT
PREVENT
THE
FERTILZATION
OF
THE
OVULE
IS
IT
TRUE
IF
YES
IS
THERE
A
RISK
OF
EXTRAUTERINE
PREGNANCY
THAT
IS
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
OVULE
INSIDE
THE
FALLOPIAN
TUBE
ACTUALLY
THAT
IS
NOT
HOW
THE
PILL
WORKS
BUT
IT
IS
HOW
THE
IUD
WORKS
THE
ORAL
CONTRACEPTIVE
PILL
ACTUALLY
PREVENTS
OVULATION
FROM
OCCURING
BY
PROVIDING
NEGATVE
FEEDBACK
TO
THE
PITUITARY
GLAND
AND
THUS
PREVENTING
THE
LH
SURGE
THAT
NORMALLY
OCCURS
AT
THE
TIME
OF
OVULATION
WITH
THE
IUD
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
FERTILIZATION
MAY
OCCUR
BUT
THE
DEVICE
PREVENTS
IMPLANTATION
WITHIN
THE
WALL
OF
THE
UTERUS
NOT
THE
VAGINA
