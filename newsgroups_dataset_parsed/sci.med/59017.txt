IS
THERE
A
RIGHTEYE
DOMINANCE
EYEDNESS
AS
THERE
IS
AN
OVERALL
RIGHTHANDEDNESS
IN
THE
POPULATION
I
MEAN
DO
MOST
PEOPLE
REQUIRE
LESS
LENS
CORRECTIONS
FOR
THE
ONE
EYE
THAN
THE
OTHER
IF
SO
WHAT
KINDS
OF
PERCENTAGES
CAN
BE
ATTACHED
TO
THIS
THERE
IS
EYE
DOMINANCE
SAME
AS
HANDEDNESS
AND
USUALLY
FOR
THE
SAME
SIDE
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
REFRACTIVE
ERROR
HOWEVER
I
RECALL
READINGSEEING
THAT
FORMER
BASEBALL
STAR
CHRIS
CHAMBLISS
HITTING
ABILITIES
WERE
IN
PART
ATTRIBUTED
TO
A
COMBINATION
OF
LEFTHANDEDNESS
RIGHTEYE
DOMINANCE
I
WAS
PART
OF
A
STUDY
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
ARIZONA
TO
SEE
WHETHER
CROSS
DOMINANT
INDIVIDUALS
THOSE
WITH
A
PARTICULAR
HANDEDNESS
BUT
WHO
HAD
DOMINANCE
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
EYE
WERE
BETTER
HITTERS
THAN
THOSE
WITH
SAME
SIDE
DOMINANCE
OF
HAND
AND
EYE
I
WAS
PICKED
FROM
MY
SOFTBALL
CLASS
BECAUSE
I
WAS
CROSS
DOMINANT
RIGHT
HAND
LEFT
EYE
WHICH
PUT
ME
IN
A
SMALL
MINORITY
AND
THE
GRAD
STUDENT
WAS
TRYING
TO
GET
AN
EQUAL
NUMBER
OF
CROSS
DOMINANT
AND
SAME
SIDE
DOMINANT
PEOPLE
TO
CONTROL
THE
STUDY
SHE
USED
A
PITCHING
MACHINE
FAST
PITCH
SINCE
I
WAS
USED
TO
SLOW
PITCH
I
DIDNT
COME
CLOSE
ACTUALLY
I
THINK
I
FOUL
TIPPED
A
FEW
TO
HITTING
THE
BALL
IF
THERE
WERE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
LIKE
ME
IN
HER
STUDY
IE
THOSE
WHO
CANT
HIT
FAST
PITCH
OR
ARE
NOT
USED
TO
HITTING
OFF
A
MACHINE
I
WOULD
SERIOUSLY
QUESTION
THE
RESULTS
OF
THAT
STUDY
I
THINK
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SOME
STUDIES
OF
MAJOR
LEAGUE
PLAYERS
ACROSS
A
FAIRLY
LARGE
CROSS
SECTION
OF
PLAYERS
TO
TEST
WHETHER
EYE
DOMINANCE
BEING
THE
SAME
OR
OPPOSITE
SIDE
WAS
BETTER
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
RESULTS
THE
WOMAN
WHO
RAN
THE
STUDY
I
WAS
IN
SAID
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
HIGHER
INCIDENCE
OF
CROSSDOMINANCE
IN
MAJOR
LEAGUERS
THAN
ACROSS
THE
GENERAL
POPULATION
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
WHETHER
ID
BELIEVE
HER
