i
saw
a
printed
up
flyer
that
stated
the
person
was
a
licensed
herbologist
and
iridologist
what
are
your
opinions
how
much
can
you
tell
about
a
persons
health
by
looking
into
their
eyes
its
bogus
see
the
sciskeptic
faq
i
edit
it
you
can
diagnose
some
things
by
looking
at
the
eyes
glaucoma
is
the
classic
example
but
there
are
probably
others
iridology
maps
parts
of
the
body
onto
the
irises
of
the
eyes
by
looking
at
the
patterns
striations
and
occasional
blobs
in
the
irises
you
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
diagnose
illnesses
all
over
the
body
the
two
questions
to
ask
any
alternative
therapist
are
how
does
it
work
what
evidence
is
there
the
answer
to
question
takes
a
little
knowledge
of
medicine
to
evaluate
i
dont
know
about
iridology
but
ive
read
a
book
on
reflexology
which
is
a
remarkably
similar
notion
except
that
the
organs
of
the
body
are
mapped
onto
the
soles
of
the
feet
there
are
supposed
to
be
channels
running
down
the
body
carrying
information
or
energy
of
some
sort
anatomists
have
found
no
such
structures
always
beware
the
words
channel
and
energy
in
any
spiel
put
out
by
an
alternative
practitioner
the
answer
to
question
is
rather
simpler
if
all
they
have
is
anecdotal
evidence
then
forget
it
ask
for
referreed
papers
in
mainstream
medical
journals
ignore
any
bull
about
the
conspiracy
of
rich
doctors
suppressing
alternative
practitioners
studies
are
done
and
papers
are
published
some
of
them
are
even
positive
the
word
licensed
in
the
flyer
is
an
interesting
one
licensed
by
whom
for
what
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
herbology
is
real
and
requires
a
license
you
can
kill
someone
by
giving
them
the
wrong
plants
to
eat
and
many
plants
contain
very
powerful
drugs
foxglove
and
willow
spring
to
mind
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
license
extends
to
the
iridology
and
i
suspect
that
if
you
ask
you
will
be
told
that
it
means
licensed
herbologist
and
iridologist
btw
the
usual
term
is
herbalist
why
use
a
different
word

these

like
them
can

research
is
not

any
reputable
idealist
