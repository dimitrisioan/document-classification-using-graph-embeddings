RE
CANDIDAYEAST
BLOOM
FACT
OR
FICTION
IN
ARTICLE
BANSCHBACHVMSOCOMOKSTATEEDU
WRITES
ARE
IN
A
DIFFERENT
CLASS
THE
BIG
QUESTION
SEEMS
TO
BE
IS
IT
REASONABLE
TO
USE
THEM
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
GI
DISTRESS
OR
SINUS
PROBLEMS
THAT
COULD
BE
DUE
TO
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
FOLLOWING
THE
USE
OF
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTICS
I
GUESS
IM
STILL
NOT
CLEAR
ON
WHAT
THE
TERM
CANDIDA
BLOOM
MEANS
BUT
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
THRUSH
SUPERFICIAL
CANDIDAL
INFECTIONS
ON
MUCOUS
MEMBRANES
CAN
OCCUR
AFTER
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
THE
QUACK
DIAGNOSIS
THAT
HAS
BEEN
BEING
DISCUSSED
FOUND
IN
THE
SINUS
MUCUS
MEMBRANES
THAN
IS
CANDIDA
WOMEN
HAVE
BEEN
KNOWN
FOR
A
VERY
LONG
TIME
TO
SUFFER
FROM
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IN
THE
VAGINA
AND
A
WOMEN
IS
LUCKY
TO
FIND
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
IS
WILLING
TO
TREAT
THE
CAUSE
AND
NOT
GIVE
GIVE
HER
ADVISE
TO
USE
THE
OTC
ANTIFUNGAL
CREAMS
LUCKY
HOW
SINCE
A
RECENT
ARTICLE
RANDOMIZED
CONTROLLED
TRIAL
OF
ORAL
YOGURT
ON
REDUCING
VAGINAL
CANDIDIASIS
IVE
MENTIONED
TO
A
NUMBER
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
FREQUENT
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
THAT
THEY
COULD
TRY
EATING
OUNCES
OF
YOGURT
DAILY
IT
TURNS
OUT
MOST
WOULD
RATHER
JUST
USE
ANTIFUNGAL
CREAMS
WHEN
THEY
GET
YEAST
INFECTIONS
YOGURT
DANGEROUS
IF
THIS
WERE
A
STANDARD
PART
OF
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
AS
GORDON
R
SAYS
IT
IS
THEN
THE
INCIDENCE
OF
GI
DISTRESS
AND
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
SHOULD
DECLINE
AGAIN
THIS
JUST
ISNT
WHAT
THE
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
IS
ABOUT
AND
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
QUACK
THERAPIES
THAT
WERE
BEING
DISCUSSED
THERE
IS
SOME
EVIDENCE
THAT
ATTEMPTS
TO
REINOCULATE
THE
GI
TRACT
WITH
BACTERIA
AFTER
ANTIBIOTIC
THERAPY
DONT
SEEM
TO
BE
VERY
HELPFUL
IN
REDUCING
DIARRHEA
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
ANYONE
WOULD
VIEW
THIS
AS
A
QUACK
THERAPY
