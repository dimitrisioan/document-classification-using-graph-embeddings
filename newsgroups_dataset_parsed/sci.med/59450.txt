I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
TRYING
THIS
DESENSITIZATION
METHOD
AGAINST
HAY
FEVER
WHAT
IS
THE
STATE
OF
AFFAIRS
ABOUT
THIS
I
WENT
TO
A
DOCTOR
AND
PAID
FOR
A
MINUTE
INTERVIEW
SCRATCHES
LEADING
TO
THE
DIAGNOSTIC
THAT
I
AM
ALLERGIC
TO
JUNE
AND
TIMOTHY
GRASS
I
BELIEVE
THIS
FROM
NOW
ON
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
SHOTS
PER
WEEK
FOR
MONTHS
FOLLOWED
BY
SHOT
PER
MONTH
OR
SO
EACH
SHOT
COSTS
TALKING
ABOUT
SOARING
COSTS
AND
THE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
I
WOULD
CALL
THAT
A
RACKET
WE
ARE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
RARE
AMAZONIAN
GRASSES
HERE
BUT
THE
GARBAGE
WHICH
GROWS
BEHIND
THE
DOCTORS
OFFICE
APART
FROM
THIS
ISSUE
I
WAS
SOMEWHAT
DISAPPOINTED
TO
FIND
OUT
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
KEEP
GETTING
THE
SHOTS
FOREVER
IS
THAT
RIGHT
THANKS
FOR
INFORMATION
GO
TO
YOUR
PUBLIC
LIBRARY

GET

FEBRUARY
