so
ill
ask
this
my
neurologist
just
prescribed
cafergot
and
midrin
as
some
alternatives
for
me
to
try
he
stated
that
the
sublingual
tablets
of
ergotamine
were
no
longer
available
any
idea
why
he
also
suggested
trying
mg
ibuprophen
i
just
found
out
about
the
sublinguals
disappearing
too
i
dont
know
why
perhaps
because
they
werent
as
profitable
as
cafergot
too
bad
since
tablets
are
sometimes
vomited
up
by
migraine
patients
and
they
dont
do
any
good
flushed
down
the
toilet
i
suspect
well
be
moving
those
patients
more
and
more
to
the
dhe
nasal
spray
which
is
far
more
effective
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and

it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
