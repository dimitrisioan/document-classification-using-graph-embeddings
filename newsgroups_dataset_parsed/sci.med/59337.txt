an
the
dangerous

was
killed
by
inmates
who
overtook

the

agenda
of
the

resulted
in
a
steady
increase
in
the
prison

for
the
past
five
years
on
jn
the
prison
population
was
projections
show
a
continued
increase
in
the
number
of
inmates
with
an
expected
prison
population
of
in
the
conditions
which
this
burgeoning
prison
population
has
created
for
corrections
officers
is
partially
reflected
in
the
number
of
assaults
by
inmates
against
staff
assaults
against
staff
increased
dramatically
between
and
and
remain
high
in
there
were
assaults
by
inmates
against
staff

to
such
assaults

the
increased

dangerous

and
understaffing
for
example
in
ohio
officertoinmate

to
the
second
worst
ratio
in
the

and

issues
facing
corrections
officers
include
aids

tuberculosis
stress
and
chemical
hazards
afscme
has
more
than
members
who
work
in
the
nations
federal
state
and
local
correctional
facilities
correction
officers
are
not
alone
in
performing
their
jobs
under
lifethreatening
conditions
every
year
american
workers
die
from
jobrelated
injuries
and
tens
of
thousands
more
die
from
occupational
disease
public
employees
do
some
of
the
nations
most
dangerous
jobs
perilous
occupations
include
highway
workers
highway
workers
are
often
injured
and
frequently
killed
by
moving
traffic
because
work
zones
are
not
barricaded
or
dont
have
proper
lighting
health
care
workers
hospitals
have
the
highest
number
of
jobrelated
injuries
and
illnesses
of
any
private
sector
employer
and
nursing
homes
ranked
fifth
there
were
more
than
jobrelated
illnesses
and
injuries
in
private
sector
hospitals
in
up
almost
percent
over
the
previous
year
it
is
generally
believed
that
health
care
workers
employed
at
public
sector
hospitals
and
nursing
homes
have
a
significantly
higher
rate
of
injuries
and
illnesses
than
do
their
private
sector
counterparts
health
and
safety
issues
facing
health
care
workers
include
exposure
to
tuberculosis
and
the
hiv
virus
back
injuries
and
high
levels
of
stress
social
workers
social
workers
who
work
in
mental
health
institutions
are
often
the
victims
of
assaults
and
sometimes
fatal
attacks
for
instance
last
october
a
man
carrying
a
semiautomatic
handgun
walked
into
the
schuyler
county
social
services
building
in
watkins
glenn
ny
and
fatally
shot
social
services
workers
before
turning
the
gun
on
himself
there
are
two
basic
problems
first
is
a
growing
lack
of
support
services
for
people
who
dont
have
the
help
they
need
because
workers
are
overworked
some
clients
are
not
given
the
adequate
amount
of
counselling
such
conditions
may
cause
clients
to
become
more
frustrated
the
quality
of
the
clients
is
also
becoming
more
violent
as
more
are
moved
out
of
the
institutions
nearly
million
workers
have
been
killed
by
workplace
hazards
since
osha
was
passed
moreover
as
afscme
president
gerald
w
mcentee
explains
osha
does
not
provide
workplace
safety
protections
for
public
employees
more
than
public
employees
are
killed
each
year
on
the
job
yet
states
still
provide
no
federallyapproved
osha
coverage
for
public
employees
said
mcentee
this
despite
the
fact
that
public
employees
highway
workers
health
care
workers
corrections
officers
to
name
but
a
few
do
some
of
the
most
dangerous
work
in
our
society
this
year
we
are
fighting
for
passage
of
osha
reform
legislation
to
give
all
workers
greater
rights
and
protections
and
finally
guarantee
all
public
employees
safe
workplaces
we
need
the
public
support
to
be
successful
government
workers
suffer
percent
more
injuries
than
private
sector
workers
and
these
injuries
are
almost
percent
more
severe
public
employees
were
exempted
from
osha
when
the
law
was
passed
in
and
today
public
employees
in
more
than
half
the
states
have
no
osha
coverage
