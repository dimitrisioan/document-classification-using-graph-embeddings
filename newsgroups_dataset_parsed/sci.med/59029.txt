i
think
thats
the
correct
spelling
i
am
looking
for
any
informationsupplies
that
will
allow
doityourselfers
to
take
krillean
pictures
im
thinking
that
education
suppliers
for
schools
might
have
a
appartus
for
sale
but
i
dont
know
any
of
the
companies
any
info
is
greatly
appreciated
in
case
you
dont
know
krillean
photography
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
involves
taking
pictures
of
an
most
of
the
time
organic
object
between
charged
plates
the
picture
will
show
energy
patterns
or
spikes
around
the
object
photographed
and
depending
on
what
type
of
object
it
is
the
spikes
or
energy
patterns
will
vary
one
might
extrapolate
here
and
say
that
this
proves
that
every
object
within
the
universe
as
we
know
it
has
its
own
energy
signature
go
to
the
library
and
look
up

hey
i
understand
vaxen
and
vms
thats
what
i
get
paid
for
my
understanding
of
astronomy
is
purely
at
the
amateur
level
or
below
so
unless
what
im
saying
is
directly
related
to
vaxvms
dont
hold
me
or
my
organization
responsible
for
it
if
it
is
related
to
vaxvms
you
can
try
to
hold
me
responsible
for
it
but
my
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
