DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
REACT
DIFFERENTLY

THINGS
ONE
SLIGHTLY
OFF
THE
SUBJECT
CASE
IN
POINT
MY
BROTHER
GOT
STUNG
BY
A
BEE
I
KNOW
HE
IS
ALLERGIC
TO
BEE
STINGS
BUT
THAT
HIS
REACTION
IS
SEVERE
LOCALIZED
SWELLING
NOT
ANAPHYLACTIC
SHOCK
I
COULD
NOT
CONVINCE
THE
DOCTORS
OF
THAT
HOWEVER
BECAUSE
THATS
NOT
WRITTEN
IN
THEIR
LITTLE
RULE
BOOK
OF
COURSE
BEE
VENOM
ISNT
A
SINGLE
CHEMICAL
COULD
BE
YOUR
BROTHER
IS
REACTING
TO
A
DIFFERENT
COMPONENT
THAN
THE
ONE
THAT
CAUSES
ANAPHYLACTIC
SHOCK
IN
OTHER
PEOPLE
HMMM
THE
LAST
TIME
I
GOT
STUNG
BY
A
BEE
I
EXPERIENCED
THE
SAME
REACTION
THE
FIRST
POSTERS
BROTHER
DID
WE
WENT
OFF
TO
THE
DOCTOR
TO
SEE
IF
I
SHOULD
WORRY
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
MY
FOOT
WAS
NOW
ABOUT
TIMES
ITS
NORMAL
SIZE
AND
ITCHED
OW
HE
BASICALLY
SAID
I
SHOULDNT
THIS
TIME
BUT
THAT
BEE
STING
ALLERGY
WAS
NOT
SOMETHING
YOU
TENDED
TO
GET
ACLIMATIZED
TO
BUT
WERE
SOMETHING
THAT
EACH
TIME
GOT
PROGRESSIVELY
WORSE
GENERALLY
AND
THAT
NEXT
TIME
COULD
BE
THE
TIME
I
GO
INTO
ANAPHYLACTIC
SHOCK
ADMITTEDLY
THIS
WAS
MANY
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
I
WAS
YOUNG
SINCE
THEN
I
JUST
MAKE
SURE
I
DONT
GET
STUNG
I
ALSO
SHOULD
CARRY
A
BEE
STING
KIT
WITH
ME
BUT
I
DONT
THIS
ISNT
SCIENTIFIC
OR
PROOF
BUT
THIS
WOULD
LEAD
ME
TO
BELIEVE
ITS
NOT
A
DIFFERENT
REACTION
JUST
A
DIFFERENT
DEGREE
OF
REACTION
ALLERGIES
WORK
THAT
WAY
PEOPLE
HAVE
VARIOUS
REACTIONS
SORT
OF
LIKE
DIABETES
SOME
PEOPLE
CAN
GET
BY
WITH
JUST
MONITORING
THEIR
DIET
OTHERS
HAVE
TO
MONITOR
THEIR
DIET
AND
USE
INSULIN
SOMETIMES
WHILE
OTHERS
HAVE
TO
WATCH
THEIR
DIET
LIKE
A
HAWK
AND
USE
INSULIN
REGULARLY
I
THINK
MSG
IS
PROBABLY
SIMILARSOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALLERGIC
REACTIONS
TO
IT
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
ALLERGIC
TO
FERMENTED
THINGS
AND
CANT
USE
SOY
SAUCEBUT
THE
CHINESE
HAVE
BEEN
USING
IT
FOR
CENTURIES
THAT
DOESNT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
THAT
ITS
SAFE

EVERYONE
