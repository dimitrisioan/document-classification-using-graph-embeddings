re
good
grief
was
re
candida
albicans
what
is
it

steve
dyer
writes
snort
ah
there
go
my
sinuses
again
oh
wow
a
classic
textbook
hey
they
laughed
at
einstein
too
yeah
ill
bet
tomorrow
the
world
listen
uncontrolled
studies
like
this
are
worthless
im
sure
you
are
you
sound
like
the
typical
hysterichypochondriac
who
responds
to
miracle
cures
yeah
it
makes
sense
to
me
so
of
course
it
should
be
taken
seriously
snort
yeah
it
sounds
reasonable
to
me
oh
really
what
tests
immunecompromised
my
ass
more
like
credulous
malingerer
this
is
a
psychiatric
syndrome
you
know
its
a
shame
that
a
drug
like
itraconazole
is
being
misused
in
this
way
its
ridiculously
expensive
and
potentially
toxic
the
trouble
is
that
it
isnt
toxic
enough
so
it
gets
abused
by
quacks
the
only
good
thing
about
nystatin
is
that
its
relatively
cheap
and
when
taken
orally
nontoxic
but
oral
nystatin
is
without
any
systemic
effect
so
unless
it
were
given
iv
it
would
be
without
any
effect
on
your
sinuses
i
wish
these
quacks
would
first
use
iv
nystatin
or
amphotericin
b
on
people
like
you
that
would
solve
the
yeast
problem
once
and
for
all
perhaps
a
little
haldol
would
go
a
long
way
towards
ameliorating
your
symptoms
are
you
paying
for
this
treatment
out
of
your
own
pocket
id
hate
to
think
my
insurance
premiums
are
going
towards
this
steve
take
a
look
at
what
you
are
saying
i
dont
see
one
construvtive
word
here
if
you
dont
have
anything
constructive
to
add
why
waste
the
bandwidth
yeah
sure
flame
me
for
doing
it
myself
is
this
scimed
or
altflame
like
it
or
not
medical
science
does
not
know
categorically
everything
about
everything
im
not
flaming
your
knowledge
just
asking
you
to
sit
back
and
ask
yourself
what
if
minds
are
like
parachutes
they
only
function
when
they
are
open
oh
and
if
you
do
want
to
flame
me
or
anyone
else
how
about
using
email
rob
who
doesnt
claim
any
relevant
qualifications
just
interest
rob
geraghty
things
are
important
to
me
robgcitruqozau

gift
of
love
the
joy
of
life
citr
and

all
its
forms
