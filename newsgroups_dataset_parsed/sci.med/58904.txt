see
the
ulterior
motive
here
it
is
easy
for
me
to
see
it
the
those
physicians
who
call
everything
lyme
and
treat
everything
there
is
a
lot
of
money
involved
you
keep
bringing
this
up
but
i
dont
understand
whats
in
it
financially
for
the
physician
to
go
ahead
and
treat
unless
the
physician
has
an
investment
in
or
is
involved
in
some
kickback
scheme
with
the
home
infusion
company
where
is
the
financial
gain
for
the
doctor
well
let
me
put
it
this
way
based
on
my
own
experience
a
general
practitioner
with
no
training
in
infectious
diseases
by
establishing
links
to
the
lyme
community
treating
patients
who
come
to
him
wondering
about
lyme
or
having
decided
they
have
lyme
as
if
they
did
saying
that
diseases
such
as
ms
are
probably
spirochetal
if
not
lyme
giving
talks
at
meetings
of
users
groups
validating
the
feelings
of
even
delusional
patients
etc
this
gp
can
go
from
being
a
runofthemill
gp
to
someone
with
lots
of
patients
in
the
hospital
and
getting
expensive
infusions
that
need
monitoring
in
his
office
and
making
lots
of
bread
also
getting
the
adulation
of
many
who
believe
his
is
their
only
hope
if
not
of
cure
then
of
control
and
seeing
his
name
in
publications
put
out
by
support
groups
etc
this
is
a
definite
temptation
harumph
getting
published
in
these
newsletters
is
hardly
something
to
aspire
to
i
cant
really
argue
with
your
logic
though
i
think
you
may
be
extrapolating
a
bit
recklessly
from
what
appears
to
be
a
sample
size
of
one
even
if
what
you
say
about
this
local
pittsburgh
guy
is
true
it
is
not
logical
or
fair
to
conclude
that
this
is
true
of
all
doctors
who
treat
lyme
disease
by
your
logic
i
could
conclude
that
all
of
the
physicians
who
consult
for
insurance
companies
and
make
money
by
denying
benefits
to
lyme
patients
are
doing
it
for
the
money
rather
than
because
they
believe
they
are
encouraging
good
medicine
i
have
no
idea
how
sincere
these
guys
are
but
their
motives
are
as
suspect
as
the
physicians
you
excoriate
for
what
you
believe
to
be
indiscriminate
treatment
i
would
really
feel
more
comfortable
discussing
the
medical
issues
in
lyme
rather
than
speculating
as
to
the
motives
of
the
various
parties
involved
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
gebcadredslpittedu
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
