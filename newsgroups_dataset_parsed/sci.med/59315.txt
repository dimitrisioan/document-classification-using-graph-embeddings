SOMEWHERE
OR
OTHER
I
READ
THAT
WHEN
A
PERSON
OF
CHINESE
HERITAGE
WAS
TOLD
THAT
HE
HAD
HIGH
BLOOD
PRESSURE
HE
RESPONDED
BY
EATING
CELERY
SORRY
I
DONT
RECALL
THE
DOSAGE
APPARENTLY
THIS
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
WORK
IN
REDUCING
HYPERTENSION
CAN
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
VERIFY
THIS
AND
IF
IT
DOES
WORK
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW

APPROPRIATE
AMOUNTS
AND
POSSIBLE
SIDEEFFECTS
