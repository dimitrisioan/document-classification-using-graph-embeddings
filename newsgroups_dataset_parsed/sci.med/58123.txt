RE
MORBUS
MENIERE
IS
THERE
A
REAL
REMEDY
IN
ARTICLE
LINDAENETCOMCOM
WRITES
MY
BIGGEST
RESENTMENT
IS
THE
DOCTOR
WHO
MAKES
IT
SEEM
LIKE
MOST
PEOPLE
WITH
DIZZINESS
CAN
BE
CURED
THATS
DEFINITELY
NOT
THE
CASE
IN
MOST
CASES
LIKE
I
SAID
ABOVE
IT
IS
A
LONG
TEDIOUS
PROCESS
THAT
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
END
UP
IN
A
PARTIAL
CURE
BE
SURE
TO
SAY
CHRONIC
DIZZINESS
NOT
JUST
DIZZINESS
MOST
PATIENTS
WITH
ACUTE
OR
SUBACUTE
DIZZINESS
WILL
GET
BETTER
THE
VERTIGINOUS
SPELLS
OF
MENIERES
WILL
ALSO
EVENTUALLY
GO
AWAY
HOWEVER
THE
PATIENT
IS
LEFT
WITH
A
DEAF
EAR
TO
ANYONE
SUFFERING
WITH
VERTIGO
DIZZINESS
OR
ANY
VARIATION
THEREOF
MY
BEST
ADVICE
TO
YOU
AS
A
FELLOWSUFFERER
IS
THIS
JUST
KEEP
SEARCHINGDONT
LET
THE
DOCTORS
TELL
YOU
THERES
NOTHING
THAT
CAN
BE
DONEDO
YOUR
OWN
RESEARCHAND
LET
YOUR
THIS
MAY
HAVE
HELPED
YOU
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
IT
IS
GOOD
GENERAL
ADVICE
THE
ODDS
THAT
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
FIND
SOME
MIRACLE
WITH
YOUR
OWN
RESEARCH
THAT
IS
SECRET
OR
HIDDEN
FROM
GENERAL
KNOWLEDGE
FOR
THIS
OR
ANY
OTHER
DISEASE
ARE
SLIM
WHEN
GOOD
ANSWERS
TO
THESE
PROBLEMS
ARE
FOUND
IT
IS
USUALLY
IN
ALL
THE
NEWSPAPERS
UNTIL
THEN
SPENDING
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
TIME
AND
ENERGY
ON
THE
MEDICAL
PROBLEM
MAY
DIVERT
THAT
ENERGY
FROM
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
THINGS
IN
LIFE
A
LIMITED
AMOUNT
SHOULD
BE
SPENT
TO
ASSURE
YOURSELF
THAT
YOUR
DOCTOR
GAVE
YOU
THE
CORRECT
STORY
BUT
AFTER
IT
BECOMES
CLEAR
THAT
YOU
ARE
DEALING
WITH
A
PROBLEM
FOR
WHICH
MEDICINE
HAS
NO
GOOD
SOLUTION
PERHAPS
THE
BEST
STRATEGY
IS
TO
JOIN
THE
SUPPORT
GROUP
AND
KEEP
ABREAST
OF
NEW
FINDINGS
BUT
NOT
TO
MAKE
A
CAREER
OUT
OF
IT
GORDON
BANKS
SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND
GEBCADREDSLPITTEDU
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
