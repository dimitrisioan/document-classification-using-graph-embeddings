I
THINK
THATS
THE
CORRECT
SPELLING
KIRILIAN
THE
PICTURE
WILL
SHOW
ENERGY
PATTERNS
OR
SPIKES
AROUND
THE
OBJECT
PHOTOGRAPHED
AND
DEPENDING
ON
WHAT
TYPE
OF
OBJECT
IT
IS
THE
SPIKES
OR
ENERGY
PATTERNS
WILL
VARY
ONE
MIGHT
EXTRAPOLATE
HERE
AND
SAY
THAT
THIS
PROVES
THAT
EVERY
OBJECT
WITHIN
THE
UNIVERSE
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
HAS
ITS
OWN
ENERGY
SIGNATURE
THERE
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
A
VERY
SIMPLE
CONVENTIONAL
EXPLANATION
FOR
THE
PHENOMENON
I
CANT
RECALL
THE
DETAILS
BUT
I
BELIEVE
IT
HAD
TO
DO
WITH
THE
OBJECT
BETWEEN
THE
PLATES
ALTERING
THE
FIELD
BECAUSE
OF
PURELY
MECHANICAL
PROPERTIES
LIKE
CAPACITANCE
THE
AURA
WAS
CAUSED
BY
DIRECT
EXPOSURE
OF
THE

FROM
