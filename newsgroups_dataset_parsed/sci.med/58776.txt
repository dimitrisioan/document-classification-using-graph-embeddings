what
about
kekules
infamous
derivation
of
the
idea
of
benzene
rings
from
a
daydream
of
snakes
in
the
fire
biting
their
tails
is
this
specific
enough
to
count
certainly
it
turns
up
repeatedly
in
basic
phil
of
sci
texts
as
an
example
of
the
inventive
component
of
hypothesizing
i
think
the
question
is
what
is
extrascientific
about
this
it
has
been
a
long
time
since
anyone
has
proposed
restrictions
on
where
one
comes
up
with
ideas
in
order
for
them
to
be
considered
legitimate
hypotheses
the
point
in
short
is
this
hypotheses
and
speculation
in
science
may
come
from
wild
flights
of
fancy
daydreams
ancient
traditions
modern
quackery
or
anywhere
else
russell
yes
but
typically
they
dont
not
every
wild
flight
of
fancy
serves
or
can
serve
in
the
appropriate
relation
to
a
hypothesis
it
is
somewhat
interesting
that
when
anyone
is
challanged
to
provide
an
example
of
this
sort
the
only
one
they
come
up
with
is
the
one
about
kekule
surely
there
must
be
others
but
apparently
this
is
regarded
as
an
extreme
example
of
a
nonrational
process
in
science
whereby
a
successful
hypothesis
was
proposed
but
how
nonrational
is
it
of
course
we
cant
hope
currently
at
least
to
explain
how
or
why
kekule
had
the
daydream
of
snakes
in
the
fire
biting
their
tails
surely
it
wasnt
the
only
daydream
he
had
what
was
special
about
this
one
could
it
have
had
something
to
do
with
a
perceived
analogy
between
the
geometry
of
the
snakes
and
problems
concerning
geometry
of
molecules
is
such
analogical
reasoning
extrascientific
or
is
it
rather
at
the
very
heart
of
science
perices
notion
of
abduction
the
use
of
models
within
and
across
disciplines
upon
close
examination
is
there
a
nonrational
mystical
leap
taking
place
or
is
it
perhaps
closer
to
a
formal
though
often
incomplete
analogy
or
model
