GREETING
I
AM
STARTING
WORK
ON
A
PROJECT
WHERE
I
AM
TRYING
TO
MAKE
STRAIN
GAGES
BOND
TO
BONE
IN
VIVO
OR
A
PERIOD
OF
SEVERAL
MONTHS
I
AM
CURRENTLY
USING
HYDROXYAPAPTITE
BACK
GAGES
AND
I
HAVE
TRIED
MBONDING
THE
GAGES
TO
THE
BONE
APART
FROM
THOSE
TWO
APPLICATION
METHODS
THERE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
MUCH
ELSE
IN
THE
LITERATURE
I
HAVE
ONLY
AN
ENGINEERING
BACKGROUND
NOT
MEDICAL
OR
BIOLOGICAL
I
WOULD
BE
INTEREST
IN
ANY
IDEAS
ABOUT
HOW
TO
STIMULTE
BONE
GROWTH
ON
THE

OF

IT
SOUNDS
AS
THOUGH
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
TRY
A
PRODUCT
SUCH
AS
SUPERGLUE
THE
ACTIVE
INGREDIENT
IS
CYNOACRYLATE
THE
SAME
COMPOUND
USED
TO
RECONSTRUCT
BONES
I
HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY
USED
SUPERGLUE
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
PROCEDURES
ON
MANY
DIFFERENT
SPECIES
OF
ANIMAL
IF
YOU
ARE
SIMPLY
TRYING
TO
ADHEAR
SOMETHING
TO
BONE
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
THIS
WOULD
BE
IDEAL
IT
BONDS
ALMOST
IMMEDIATLY
IS
RESISTANT
TO
INFECTION
AND
IS
NONIRRITATING
