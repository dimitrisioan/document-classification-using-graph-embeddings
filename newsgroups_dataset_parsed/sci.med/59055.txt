BROKEN
RIB
FROM
JCONEBALMANACBCCA
HELLO
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
THE
RIGHT
CONFERENCE
TO
ASK
THIS
QUESTION
HOWEVER
HERE
I
GO
I
AM
A
COMMERCIAL
FISHERMAN
AND
I
FELL
ABOUT
WEEKS
AGO
DOWN
INTO
THE
HOLD
OF
THE
BOAT
AND
BROKE
OR
CRACKED
A
RIB
AND
WRENCHED
AND
BRUISED
MY
BACK
AND
LEFT
ARM
MY
QUESTION
I
HAVE
BEEN
TO
A
DOCTOR
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
WAS
BEST
TO
DO
NOTHING
AND
IT
WOULD
HEAL
UP
WITH
NO
LONG
TERM
EFFECT
AND
INDEED
I
AM
ABOUT
BETTER
HOWEVER
THE
WORK
I
DO
IS
VERY
HARD
AND
I
AM
STILL
NOT
ABLE
TO
GO
BACK
TO
WORK
THE
THING
THAT
WORRIES
ME
IS
THE
MOVEMENT
OR
CLUNKING
I
FEEL
AND
HEAR
BACK
THERE
WHEN
I
MOVE
CERTAIN
WAYS
I
HEARD
SOME
ONE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
RIB
THEY
BROKE
YEARS
AGO
AND
THAT
IT
STILL
BOTHERS
THEM
ANY
OPINIONS
THANX

CHEERS
