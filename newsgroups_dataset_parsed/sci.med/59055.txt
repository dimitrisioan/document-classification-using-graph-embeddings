broken
rib
from
jconebalmanacbcca
hello
i
am
not
sure
if
this
is
the
right
conference
to
ask
this
question
however
here
i
go
i
am
a
commercial
fisherman
and
i
fell
about
weeks
ago
down
into
the
hold
of
the
boat
and
broke
or
cracked
a
rib
and
wrenched
and
bruised
my
back
and
left
arm
my
question
i
have
been
to
a
doctor
and
was
told
that
it
was
best
to
do
nothing
and
it
would
heal
up
with
no
long
term
effect
and
indeed
i
am
about
better
however
the
work
i
do
is
very
hard
and
i
am
still
not
able
to
go
back
to
work
the
thing
that
worries
me
is
the
movement
or
clunking
i
feel
and
hear
back
there
when
i
move
certain
ways
i
heard
some
one
talking
about
the
rib
they
broke
years
ago
and
that
it
still
bothers
them
any
opinions
thanx
and
cheers
