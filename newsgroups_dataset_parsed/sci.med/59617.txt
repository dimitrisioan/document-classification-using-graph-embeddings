the
prozac
gave
very
bad
anxietyjitters
and
insomina
it
was
impossible
to
sit
still
for
more
than
a
minute
or
so
i
tried
prozac
a
few
months
ago
and
had
some
insomnia
from
it
but
no
anxiety
or
jitters
i
probably
could
have
lived
with
the
insomnia
if
the
prozac
had
done
any
good
but
it
only
provided
a
tiny
benefit
maybe
because
the
person
who
prescribed
it
didnt
know
much
and
gave
up
after
a
dose
didnt
work
now
im
seeing
a
psychiatrist
who
has
put
me
on
zoloft
another
serotonin
reuptake
inhibitor
like
prozac
one
pillday
seemed
to
help
some
now
im
trying
zoloft
has
fewer
and
milder
side
effects
than
prozac
i
think
my
doctor
said
that
only
of
the
people
taking
zoloft
have
to
discontinue
it
because
of
side
effects
the
only
problem
im
having
is
some
minor
gi
distress
but
nothing
too
annoying
hopefully
the
zoloft
will
work
maybe
your
friend
should
try
this
one
next
my
psychiatrists
strategy
seems
to
be
to
first
try
one
of
the
serotonin
drugs
usually
prozac
if
that
works
great
if
it
works
but
has
too
many
side
effects
try
zoloft
or
maybe
paxil
if
the
serotonin
drugs
dont
work
at
all
try
one
of
the
tricyclics
like
desipramine
suggestions
as
to
the
next
step
having
a
doctor
who
knows
something
about
antidepressants
can
make
a
big
difference
my
psychiatrist
claims
that
most
gps
and
fps
dont
have
much
experience
in
this
area
and
from
what
ive
seen
im
inclined
to
believe
him
i
think
i
know
more
about
antidepressants
than
the
people
at
my
family
practitioners
office
disclaimer
im
not
a
doctor
what
i
know
about
this
comes
from
talking
to
my
psychiatrist
and
reading
