I
HAVE
HAD
A
SORE
THROAT
FOR
ALMOST
A
WEEK
WHEN
I
LOOK
INTO
THE
MIRROR
WITH
THE
AID
OF
A
FLASH
LIGHT
I
SEE
WHITE
PLAQUES
IN
THE
VERY
BACK
OF
MY
THROAT
ON
THE
SIDES
I
WENT
TO
A
HEALTH
CENTER
TO
HAVE
A
THROAT
CULTURE
TAKEN
THEY
SAID
THAT
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
STREP
THROAT
COULD
A
VIRAL
INFECTION
CAUSE
WHITE
PLAQUES
ON
THE
SIDES
OF
MY
THROAT
FIRST
I
AM
NOT
A
DOCTOR
I
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
BEEN
THROUGH
IT
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
TONSILITIS
LIT
SWOLLEN
TONSILS
FEEL
UNDER
YOUR
JAW
HINGE
FOR
A
SWELLING
ON
EACH
SIDE
IF
YOU
FIND
THEM
ITS
TONSILITIS
IVE
HAD
THIS
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
IN
THE
PAST
THE
DOCTOR
PRESCRIBED
A
WEEKS
COURSE
OF
PENICILLIN
AND
THAT
CLEARED
IT
UP
IN
MY
CASE
IT
WAS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
GLANDULAR
FEVER
WHICH
IS
A
VIRAL
INFECTION
WHICH
FROM
MY
POINT
OF
VIEW
RESEMBLED
FLU
AND
TONSILITIS
THAT
KEPT
COMING
BACK
FOR
A
YEAR
OR
SO
THERE
IS
A
BLOOD
TEST
FOR
THIS
IN
CONCLUSION
SEE
A
DOCTOR
IF
YOU
HAVE
NOT
DONE
SO
ALREADY
