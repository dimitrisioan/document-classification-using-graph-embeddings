FACT
OR

I
CAN
NOT
BELIEVE
THE
WAY
THIS
THREAD
ON
CANDIDAYEAST
HAS
PROGRESSED
STEVE
DYER
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
EXCHANGING
WORDS
OVER
THE
SAME
TOPIC
IN
SCI
MED
NUTRITION
WHEN
HE
DISPLAYED
HIS
TYPICAL
RESERVE
AND
ATTACKED
A
WOMEN
POSTER
FOR
BEING
TREATED
BY
A
LISCENCED
PHYSICIAN
FOR
A
DISEASE
THAT
DID
NOT
EXIST
CALLING
THIS
PHYSICIAN
A
QUACK
WAS
REPREHENSIBLE
STEVE
AND
I
SEE
THAT
YOU
AND
SOME
OF
THE
OTHERS
ARE
DOING
IT
HERE
AS
WELL
LET
ME
TELL
YOU
WHO
THE
QUACKS
REALLY
ARE
THESE
ARE
THE
PHYSICANS
WHO
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
THE
HUMAN
BODY
INTERACTS
WITH
ITS
ENVIRONMENT
AND
HOW
THAT
BALANCE
CAN
BE
ALTERED
BY
DIET
AND
ANTIBIOTICS
THESE
ARE
THE
PHYSICIANS
WHO
DISMISS
THEIR
PATIENTS
WITH
DIFFICULT
SYMPTOMATOLOGY
AND
MAKE
THEM
GO
FROM
DOCTOR
TO
DOCTOR
TO
FIND
RELIEFLIKE
ELAINE
IN
SCI
MED
NUTRITION
AND
THEN
WHEN
THEY
FIND
ONE
THAT
SOLVES
THEIR
PROBLEM
THE
REST
START
YELLING
QUACK
COULD
IT
JUST
BE
PROFESSIONAL
JEALOUSY
I
COULDNT
HELP
ELAINE
OR
JON
BUT
SOMEBODY
ELSE
DID
COULD
THEY
KNOW
MORE
THAN
ME
NO
WAY
THEY
MUST
BE
A
QUACK
IVE
BEEN
TEACHING
A
HUMAN
NUTRITION
COURSE
FOR
MEDICAL
STUDENTS
FOR
OVER
TEN
YEARS
NOW
AND
GUESS
WHO
THE
MOST
RECEPTIVE
STUDENTS
ARE
THOSE
THAT
WERE
RAISED
ON
FARMS
AND
SAW
FIRSTHAND
THE
EFFECT
OF
DIET
ON
THE
HEALTH
OF
THEIR
FARM
ANIMALS
AND
THOSE
STUDENTS
WHO
HAD
MADE
A
DRAMATIC
DIET
CHANGE
PRIOR
TO
ENTERING
MEDICAL
SCHOOLSWITCHED
TO
THE
VEGAN
DIET
TYPICALLY
THIS
IS
ABOUT
OF
MY
CLASS
OF
STUDENTS
THOSE
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
NUTRITION
EITHER
TUNE
ME
OUT
OR
JUST
STOP
COMING
TO
CLASS
THATS
OKAY
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
THAT
SOME
OF
WHAT
IM
TEACHING
IS
GOING
TO
STICK
AND
THERE
WILL
BE
AT
LEAST
A
FEW
ENLIGHTENED
PHYSICIANS
PRACTICING
IN
THE
US
ITS
REALLY
TOO
BAD
THAT
MOST
US
MEDICAL
SCHOOLS
DONT
COVER
NUTRITION
BECAUSE
IF
THEY
DID
CANDIDA
WOULD
NOT
BE
VIEWED
AS
A
NONDISEASE
BY
SO
MANY
IN
THE
MEDICAL
PROFESSION
IN
ANIMAL
HUSBANDRY
AN
ANIMAL
IS
REINNOCULATED
WITH
GOOD
BACTERIA
AFTER
ANTIBIOTICS
ARE
STOPPED
MEDICINE
HAS
DECIDED
THAT
SINCE
HUMANS
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
RUMINANT
STOMACH
NO
SUCH
REINNOCULATION
WITH
GOOD
BACTERIA
IS
NEEDED
AFTER
COMING
OFF
A
BRAOD
SPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTIC
HUMANS
HAVE
ALL
KINDS
OF
DIFFERENT
ORGANISMS
LIVING
IN
THE
GI
SYSTEMMOUTH
STOMACH
SMALL
AND
LARGE
INTESTINE
SINUSES
VAGINA
AND
ON
THE
SKIN
THESE
ARE
NONPATHOGENIC
BECAUSE
THEY
DO
NOT
CAUSE
DISEASE
IN
PEOPLE
UNLESS
THE
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
IS
COMPROMISED
THEY
ARE
ALSO
CALLED
NONPATHOGENS
BECAUSE
UNLIKE
THE
PATHOGENIC
ORGANISMS
THAT
CAUSE
HUMAN
DISEASE
THEY
DO
NOT
PRODUCE
TOXINS
AS
THEY
LIVE
OUT
THEIR
MERRY
EXISTENCE
IN
AND
ON
OUR
BODY
BUT
ANY
OF
THESE
ORGANISMS
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED
PATHOGENIC
IF
IT
MANAGES
TO
TAKE
UP
RESIDENCE
WITHIN
THE
BODY
A
POOR
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
BARRIER
CAN
LET
THIS
HAPPEN
AND
VITAMIN
A
IS
MAINLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
SETTING
UP
THIS
BARRIER
STEVE
GOT
REAL
UPSET
WITH
ELAINES
DOCTOR
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
USING
ANTIFUNGALS
AND
VITAMIN
A
FOR
HER
GI
PROBLEMS
IF
STEVE
REALLY
UNDERSTOOOD
WHAT
VITAMIN
A
DOES
IN
THE
BODY
HE
WOULD
NOTOR
AT
LEAST
SHOULD
NOT
BE
CALLING
ELAINES
DOCTOR
A
QUACK
HERE
IS
A
BRIEF
PRIMER
ON
YEAST
YEAST
INFECTIONS
AS
THEY
ARE
COMMONLY
CALLED
ARE
NOT
TRUELY
CAUSED
BY
YEASTS
THE
MOST
COMMON
ORGANISM
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THIS
TYPE
OF
INFECTION
IS
CANDIDA
ALBICANS
OR
MONILIA
WHICH
IS
ACTUALLY
A
YEASTLIKE
FUNGUS
AN
INFECTION
CAUSED
BY
THIS
ORGANISM
IS
CALLED
CANDIDIASIS
CANDIDIASIS
IS
A
VERY
RARE
OCCURANCE
BECAUSE
LIKE
AN
E
COLI
INFECTION
IT
REQUIRES
THAT
THE
HOST
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
BE
SEVERLY
DEPRESSED
CANDIDA
IS
FREQUENTLY
FOUND
ON
THE
SKIN
AND
ALL
OF
THE
MUCOUS
MEMBRANES
OF
NORMAL
HEALTHY
PEOPLE
AND
IT
RARELY
BECOMES
A
PROBLEM
UNLESS
SOME
PREDISPOSING
FACTOR
IS
PRESENT
SUCH
AS
A
HIGH
BLOOD
GLUCOSE
LEVELDIABETES
OR
AN
ORAL
COURSE
OF
ANTIBIOTICS
HAS
BEEN
USED
IN
DIABETICS
THEIR
SECRETIONS
CONTAIN
MUCH
HIGHER
AMOUNTS
OF
GLUCOSE
CANDIDA
UNLIKE
BACTERIA
IS
VERY
LIMITED
IN
ITS
FOODFUEL
SELECTION
WITHOUT
GLUCOSE
IT
CAN
NOT
GROW
IT
JUST
BARELY
SURVIVES
IF
IT
GETS
ACCESS
TO
A
LOT
OF
GLUCOSE
IT
BLOOMS
AND
OVER
RIDES
THE
OTHER
ORGANISMS
LIVING
WITH
IT
IN
THE
SINUSES
GI
TRACT
OR
VAGINA
IN
DIABETICS
SKIN
LESIONS
CAN
ALSO
FOSTER
A
GOOD
BLOOM
SITE
FOR
THESE
LITTLE
BUGGERS
THE
BLOOM
IS
USUALLY
JUST
A
MINOR
IRRITANT
IN
MOST
PEOPLE
BUT
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
REALLY
DEVELOP
A
BAD
INFLAMMATORY
PROCESS
AT
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
OR
SKIN
BLOOM
SITE
WHETHER
THIS
IS
AN
ALLERGIC
LIKE
REACTION
TO
THE
CANDIDA
OR
NOT
ISNT
CERTAIN
WHEN
THE
BLOOM
IS
IN
THE
VAGINA
OR
ON
THE
SKIN
IT
CAN
BE
EASLIY
SEEN
AND
SOME
DOCTORS
DO
THEN
TRY
TO
TREAT
IT
IF
ITS
INTERNAL
ONLY
SYMPTOMS
CAN
BE
USED
AND
THESE
SYMPTOMS
ARE
PRETTY
NONDISCRIPT
CANDIDA
IS
KEPT
IN
CHECK
IN
MOST
PEOPLE
BY
THE
NORMAL
BACTERIAL
FLORA
IN
THE
SINUSES
THE
GI
TRACTMOUTH
STOMACH
AND
INTESTINES
AND
IN
THE
VAGINAL
TRACT
WHICH
COMPETE
WITH
IT
FOR
FOOD
THE
HUMAN
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
USUSALLY
DOES
NOT
BOTHER
ITSELF
WITH
THESENONPATHOGENIC
ORGANISMS
UNLESS
THEY
BROACH
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
BARRIER
IF
THEY
DO
AN
INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE
WILL
BE
SET
UP
MOST
AMERICANS
ARE
NOT
GETTING
ENOUGH
VITAMIN
A
FROM
THEIR
DIETS
ABOUT
OF
ALL
AMERICANS
DIE
WITH
LESS
VITAMIN
A
THAN
THEY
WERE
BORN
WITHUS
AUTOPSY
STUDIES
WHILE
THIS
LOW
LEVEL
OF
VITAMIN
A
DOES
NOT
CAUSE
PATHOLOGYBLINDNESS
IT
DOES
IMPAIR
THE
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
BARRIER
SYSTEM
THIS
WOULD
THEN
BE
A
PREDISPOSING
FACTOR
FOR
A
STRONG
INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE
AFTER
A
CANDIDA
BLOOM
WHILE
DIABETICS
CAN
SUFFER
FROM
A
CANDIDA
BLOOM
THE
MOST
COMMON
CAUSE
OF
THIS
TYPE
OF
BLOOM
IS
THE
USE
OF
BROAD
SPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTICS
WHICH
KNOCK
DOWN
MANY
DIFFERENT
KINDS
OF
BACTERIA
IN
THE
BODY
AND
REMOVE
THE
MAIN
COMPETITION
FOR
CANDIDA
AS
FAR
AS
FOOD
IS
CONCERNED
WHILE
DRUGS
ARE
AVAILABLE
TO
HANDLE
CANDIDA
MANY
PATIENTS
FIND
THAT
THEIR
DOCTOR
WILL
NOT
USE
THEM
UNLESS
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
OF
A
SYSTEMIC
INFECTION
THE
TOXICITY
OF
THE
ANTIFUNGAL
DRUGS
DOES
WARRANT
SOME
CAUTION
BUT
IF
THE
GI
OR
SINUS
INFLAMMATION
IS
SUSPECTED
TO
BE
CANDIDAAND
RECENT
USE
OF
A
BROAD
SPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTIC
IS
THE
SMOKING
GUN
THEN
ANTIFUNGAL
USE
SHOULD
BE
APPRORPRIATE
JUST
AS
THE
ANTIFUNGAL
CREAMS
ARE
AN
APPROPRIATE
TREATMENT
FOR
RECURRING
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
IN
SPITE
OF
WHAT
MR
STEVE
DYER
SAYS
BUT
EVEN
IN

THE

OF

IF

THE

WOULD

MY

HAD
THIS

PROBLEM
AFTER
GOING
ON

CONTROL
PILLS
AND
SEARCHED
FOR
OVER
A

UNTIL
SHE
FOUND
A
GYNOCOLOGIST
WHO
SOLVED
THE
PROBLEM
RATHER
THAN
JUST
WRITTING
SCRIPTS
FOR

THIS
WAS
A

WHO

HAVE
OFTEN
WONDERED
WHAT
AN

DISTRESS
OR

PROBLEMS
WOULD
DO
ABOUT
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
HE
TELLS
HIS
PATIENTS

THE

L
ACIDOPHILUS
IS
AN
ACID
PRODUCING
BACTERIA
WHICH
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
BACTERIA
FOUND
IN
THE

OF
HEALTHY

IF
TAKEN
ORALLY
IT
CAN
ALSO
BECOME
A
MAJOR
BACTERIA
IN
THE

THROUGH

IT
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
USED
TO
INNOCULATE
THE

MEMBRANES
BUT
BEFORE
THIS
INNOCULATION
OCCURS
THE

TO

WILL

A

OUT
THE
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT

THAT
VITAMIN
A
PLAYS
IN

IN
THE

AND
WHY
VITAMIN
A
SHOULD
BE
EFFECTIVE
IN

WITH

ANOTHER
EFFECTIVE
DIETARY
TREATMENT
IS
TO
RESTRICT
CARBOHYDRATE
INTAKE
DURING
THE

THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT
IF
THE

IS
INVOLVED
IF

CAN

ITS
NOT
GOING
TO
OUT
GROW
THE

AND
YOU
THEN
GIVE
BACTERIA

CAN

FOR

A

TO
