DENTAL
FILLINGS
QUESTION
I
HAVE
BEEN
HEARING
BAD
THING
ABOUT
AMALGAM
DENTAL
FILLINGS
SOME
SAY
THE
LEAD
MERCURY
LEECHES
INTO
YOUR
SYSTEM
AND
THIS
IS
BAD
AND
I
HAVE
RECENTLY
HEARD
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
SUSPICION
THAT
THE
MERCURY
IS
A
BREEDING
GROUND
FOR
BACTERIA
THAT
WILL
BE
RESISTANT
TO
ANTIBIOTICS
MY
DENTIST
WANTS
TO
USE
AN
AMALGAM
FILLING
FOR
ME
IN
A
PLACE
WHERE
I
HAVE
TWO
CAVATIES
IN
ONE
TOOTH
AND
WANTS
TO
USE
ONE
FILLING
TO
COVER
BOTH
HE
SAYS
THAT
COMPOSITE
FILLING
DONT
HOLD
UP
WELL
WHEN
THEY
ARE
LARGE
SO
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
OTHER
CHOICES
BESIDES
AMALGAM
AND
COMPOSITE
AND
SHOULD
I
REALLY
EVEN
BE
WORRIED
ABOUT
AMALGAM
I
HEARD
THAT
SOME
SCANDANAVIAN
COUNTRY
DOES
NOT
EVEN
USE
THEM
ANY
MORE
IS
THIS
TRUE
ANY
INFORMATION
YOU
CAN
GIVE
ME
WILL
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
THANKS
DAVE
CHILDS
