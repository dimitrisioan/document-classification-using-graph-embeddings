IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
ABOUT
THIS
TOPIC
ELECTRICAL
HEART
FAILURE
ONE
OF
MY
FRIENDS
HAS
HAD
TO
GO
TO
THE
DOCTOR
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
CHEST
PAINS
THE
DOC
SAID
IT
WAS
ARYTHMIA
SO
HE
HAD
TO
GO
TO
A
NEW
YORK
HOSPITAL
FOR
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
TO
GET
TREATED
HIS
DOCTORS
SAID
THAT
HE
COULD
DIE
FROM
IT
AND
THE
MEDICATION
CAUSED
CANCER
THAT
HE
WAS
TAKING
WELL
I
SUGGESTED
THAT
HE
RUN
EXCERSIZE
AND
EAT
MORE
HE
IS
VERY
SKINNY
BUT
HE
SAYS
THAT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
CAUSES
ARYTHMIA
AND
HOW
IT
CAN
BE
TREATED
THANKS
