introduction
to
molecular
biology
for
computer
scientists
prof
mick
noordewier
rutgers
university
this
overview
of
the
essential
facts
of
molecular
biology
is
intended
as
an
introduction
to
the
field
for
computer
scientists
who
wish
to
apply
their
tools
to
this
rich
and
complex
domain
material
covered
will
include
structural
and
informational
molecules
the
basic
organization
of
the
cell
and
of
genetic
material
the
central
dogma
of
gene
expression
and
selected
other
topics
in
the
area
of
structure
function
and
regulation
as
relates
to
current
computational
approaches
dr
noordewier
has
appointments
in
both
computer
science
and
biology
at
rutgers
and
has
extensive
experience
in
basic
biological
research
in
addition
to
his
current
work
in
computational
biology
introduction
to
artificial
intelligence
for
biologists
dr
richard
lathrop
mit
arris
corp
an
overview
of
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence
will
be
presented
as
it
relates
to
actual
and
potential
biological
applications
fundamental
techniques
symbolic
programming
languages
and
notions
of
search
will
be
discussed
as
well
as
selected
topics
in
somewhat
greater
detail
such
as
knowledge
representation
inference
and
machine
learning
the
intended
audience
includes
biologists
with
some
computational
background
but
no
extensive
exposure
to
artificial
intelligence
dr
lathrop
codeveloper
of
ariadne
and
related
technologies
has
worked
in
the
area
of
artificial
intelligence
applied
to
biological
problems
in
both
academia
and
industry
neural
networks
statistics
and
information
theory
in
biological
sequence
analysis
dr
alan
lapedes
los
alamos
national
laboratory
this
tutorial
will
cover
the
most
rapidlyexpanding
facet
of
intelligent
systems
for
molecular
biology
that
of
machine
learning
techniques
applied
to
sequence
analysis
closely
interrelated
topics
to
be
addressed
include
the
use
of
artifical
neural
networks
to
elicit
both
specific
signals
and
general
characteristics
of
sequences
and
the
relationship
of
such
approaches
to
statistical
techniques
and
informationtheoretic
views
of
sequence
data
dr
lapedes
of
the
theoretical
division
at
los
alamos
has
long
been
a
leader
in
the
use
of
such
techniques
in
this
domain
genetic
algorithms
and
genetic
programming
prof
john
koza
stanford
university
the
genetic
algorithm
an
increasingly
popular
approach
to
highly
nonlinear
multidimensional
optimization
problems
was
originally
inspired
by
a
biological
metaphor
this
tutorial
will
cover
both
the
biological
motivations
and
the
actual
implementation
and
characteristics
of
the
algorithm
genetic
programming
an
extension
wellsuited
to
problems
where
the
discovery
of
the
size
and
shape
of
the
solution
is
a
major
part
of
the
problem
will
also
be
addressed
particular
attention
will
be
paid
to
biological
applications
and
to
identifying
resources
and
software
that
will
permit
attendees
to
begin
using
the
methods
dr
koza
a
consulting
professor
of
computer
science
at
stanford
has
taught
this
subject
since
and
is
the
author
of
a
standard
text
in
the
field
linguistic
methods
in
sequence
analysis
prof
david
searls
university
of
pennsylvania
shmuel
pietrokovski
weizmann
institute
approaches
to
sequence
analysis
based
on
linguistic
methodologies
are
increasingly
in
evidence
these
involve
the
adaptation
of
tools
and
techniques
from
computational
linguistics
for
syntactic
pattern
recognition
and
gene
prediction
the
classification
of
genetic
structures
and
phenomena
using
formal
language
theory
the
identification
of
significant
vocabularies
and
overlapping
codes
in
sequence
data
and
sequence
comparison
reflecting
taxonomic
and
functional
relatedness
dr
searls
who
holds
research
faculty
appointments
in
both
genetics
and
computer
science
at
penn
represents
the
branch
of
this
field
that
considers
higherorder
syntactic
approaches
to
sequence
data
while
shmuel
pietrokovski
has
studied
and
published
with
prof
