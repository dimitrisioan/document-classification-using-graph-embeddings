OFTEN

KIDS
FALL
SICK

ASHWIN
RAM
WRITES
OUR
SON
HAS
STARTED
FALLING
SICK
QUITE
OFTEN
EVERY
SINCE
HE
STARTED
GOING
TO
DAY
CARE
HE
WAS
AT
HOME
FOR
THE
FIRST
YEAR
AND
HE
DID
NOT
FALL
SICK
EVEN
ONCE
NOW
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
HE
HAS
SOME
SORT
OF
COLD
OR
FLU
PRETTY
MUCH
ONCE
A
MONTH
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THE
COLD
LEADS
TO
AN
EAR
INFECTION
AS
WELL
WITH
THE
RESULT
THAT
HE
ENDS
UP
BEING
ON
ANTIBIOTICS
WEEKS
OUT
OF
I
KNOW
KIDS
IN
DAY
CARE
FALL
SICK
MORE
OFTEN
BUT
WE
SOUNDS
PRETTY
FAMILIAR
I
POSTED
SIMILAR
CRIES
ABOUT
LAST
SEPTEMBER
WHEN
CAROLINE
JUST
ENTERED
DAYCARE
SHE
WAS
TWO
THEN
AND
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
CONTINUOUS
COLDS
SINCE
UNTIL
LAST
MARCH
AS
SPRING
APPROACHES
HER
COLDS
SLOWED
DOWN
MEANWHILE
WE
GREW
MORE
AND
MORE
RELAXED
ABOUT
HER
COLDS
ONLY
ONCE
DID
THE
DOCTOR
DIAGNOSED
AN
EAR
INFECTION
AND
ONLY
TWICE
SHE
HAD
ANTIBIOTICS
THE
OTHER
TIME
WAS
DUE
TO
SINUS
INFECTION
AND
I
WISHED
THAT
I
DID
NOT
GIVE
HER
THAT
AWFUL
SEPTRA
ARE
THERE
ANY
STUDIES
THAT
CAN
HELP
ANSWER
SOME
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
THERE
ARE
THE
NET
STUDIES
THAT
IS
IF
YOU
READ
THIS
NEWSGROUP
OFTEN
THERE
WILL
BE
A
ROUND
OF
QUESTIONS
LIKE
THIS
EVERY
MONTH
THERE
MIGHT
BE
FORMAL
STUDIES
LIKE
THAT
BUT
BEAR
WITH
MY
NOT
SO
ACADEMIC
EXPERIENCE
OKAY
HOW
OFTEN
DO
KIDS
IN
THEIR
FIRST
SECOND
AND
THIRD
YEARS
FALL
SICK
HOW
OFTEN
DO
THEY
GET
COLDS
FLUS
EAR
INFECTIONS
GEE
I
BET
YOULL
HEAR
CASES
IN
ALL
THESE
CATAGORIES
IS
THERE
ANY
DATA
ON
HOME
CARE
VS
DAY
CARE
I
AM
PRETTY
SURE
AN
INSULATED
CHILD
AT
HOME
SICKS
LESS
BUT
THAT
CHILD
STILL
WILL
FACE
THE
WORLD
ONE
DAY
DOES
BEING
SICK
BUILD
IMMUNITY
LEADING
TO
LESS
ILLNESS
LATER
THATS
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
AND
COMFORT
MYSELF
WITH
CAROLINE
WILL
GET
MORE
AND
MORE
COLDS
FOR
SURE
BEFORE
SHE
LEARNED
NOT
TO
STICK
HER
HAND
IN
OTHER
KIDS
MOUTH
NOR
LET
OTHER
KIDS
DO
THE
SAME
COLD
VIRUS
MUTATE
EASILY
HOWEVER
I
HOPE
THAT
HER
IMMUNE
SYSTEM
WILL
BE
STRONGER
TO
FIGHT
THESE
DISEASES
SO
SHE
WOULD
BE
LESS
SEVERELY
AFFECTED
EVERYTIME
SHE
HAS
A
COLD
WE
MAKE
SURE
SHE
BLOW
HER
NOSE
FREQUENTLY
AND
GIVE
HER
DORCOL
OR
DIMETAPP
AT
NIGHT
SO
SHE
CAN
HAVE
GOOD
REST
THANKS
TO
SOME
SUGGESTIONS
FROM
THE
NET
THATS
ABOUT
ALL
THE
CARE
SHE
NEEDS
FROM
US
I
TRY
VERY
HARD
TO
KEEP
HER
OFF
ANTIBIOTICS
TWICE
HER
PED
GAVE
ME
CHOICE
TO
DECIDE
WHETHER
SHE
WOULD
HAVE
ANTIBIOTICS
I
WAITED
JUST
LONG
ENOUGH
DAYS
TO
SEE
THAT
SHE
FOUGHT
THE
ILLNESS
OFF
I
DO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
CHOICE
IF
THE
CHILD
IS
IN
PAIN
ANDOR
HIGH
FEVER
DOES
IT
MAKE
KIDS
WEAKER
LEADING
TO
MORE
ILLNESS
LATER
OR
DOES
IT
NOT
HAVE
ANY
LONG
TERM
EFFECT
IF
THE
CHILD
DOESNT
RELY
ON
ANTIBIOTICS
TO
FIGHT
OFF
THE
SICKNESS
EVERYTIME
THEN
THE
CHILD
SHOULD
BE
STRONGER
DOES
TAKING
ANTIBIOTICS
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
HAVE
ANY
NEGATIVE
LONG
TERM
EFFECTS
ILL
LEAVE
THIS
TO
EXPERT
HOW
DOES
ONE
TELL
IF
A
CHILD
IS
MORE
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ILLNESS
THAN
NORMAL
AND
WHAT
DOES
ONE
DO
ABOUT
IT
IF
YOUR
CHILD
JUST
ENTERED
DAYCARE
IM
PRETTY
SURE
THE
FIRST
MONTHS
WILL
BE
THE
HARDEST
THEN
YOU
GET
MORE
USED
TO
IT
BOY
DO
I
HATE
TO
SEE
ME
TYPING
THIS
SENTENCE
I
RECALL
WHEN
I
READ
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
LAST
SEPTEMBER
I
SAID
TO
MYSELF
OH
SURE
BUT
I
DO
GET
USED
TO
IT
NOW
HOWEVER
I
DO
HEAR
PEOPLE
SAY
THAT
IT
DOES
GET
BETTER
AFTER
A
YEAR
OR
TWO
I
AM
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
A
HEALTHIER
NEXT
WINTER
AS
IT
GETS
WARMER
I
HOPE
YOU
DO
GET
SOME
BREAK
SOON
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
TO
BUILD
IMMUNITY
AND
RESISTANCE
EAT
WELL
SLEEP
WELL
TRY
NOT
TO
USE
ANTIBIOTICS
IF
NOT
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
GOOD
LUCK
