A
MAILING
LIST
ON
EPILEPSY

HAVE
SEEN
A
FAIR
BIT
OF
TRAFFIC
RECENTLY
CONCERNING
EPILEPSY
AND
SEIZURES
I
AM
ALSO
INTERESTED
IN
THIS
SUBJECT
I
HAVE
A
SON
WITH
EPILEPSY
AND
I
AM
VERY
ACTIVE
WITH
THE
LOCAL
ASSOCIATION
I
POSTED
A
MESSAGE
LIKE
THIS
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
AND
RECEIVED
NO
REPLIES
BUT
HERE
IT
IS
AGAIN
IS
ANYONE
INTERESTED
IN
PARTICIPATING
IN
A
MAILING
LIST
ON
EPILEPSY
AND
SEIZURES

WOULD
ALLOW
US
TO
HOLD
DISCUSSIONS
AND
SHARE
INFORMATION
VIA
ELECTRONIC
MAIL
I
ALREADY
RUN
A
LISTSERVER
FOR
TWO
OTHER
GROUPS
SO
THE

WOULD
BE
EASY

ARE
INTERESTED

GET
ENOUGH
REPLIES

WILL
MAKE
IT
HAPPEN

HAVE
ALSO
STARTED
A
