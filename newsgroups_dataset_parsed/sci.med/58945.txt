SHARON
PAULSON
WROTE
ONCE
AGAIN
WE
ARE
WAITING
I
HAVE
BEEN
THINKING
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
GOOD
TO
GET
TO
AS
LARGE
A
GROUP
AS
POSSIBLE
TO
SEE
IF
ANYONE
HAS
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
I
KNOW
THAT
MEMBERS
OF
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
ARE
SOMETIMES
LOATHE
TO
ADMIT
THE
IMPORTANCE
THAT
DIET
AND
FOODS
PLAY
IN
OUR
GENERAL
HEALTH
AND
WELLBEING
ANYWAY
AS
YOU
CAN
GUESS
I
AM
WORRIED
SICK
ABOUT
THIS
AND
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
IDEAS
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HAS
SORRY
TO
BE
SO
WORDY
BUT
I
WANTED
TO
REALLY
GET
ACROSS
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
HERE
I
DONT
KNOW
ANYTHING
SPECIFICALLY
BUT
I
HAVE
ONE
FURTHER
ANECDOTE
A
COLLEAGUE
OF
MINE
HAD
A
CHILD
WITH
A
SERIOUS
CONGENITAL
DISEASE
TUBEROUS
SCLEROSIS
ALONG
WITH
MENTAL
RETARDATION
COMES
A
SERIOUS
SEIZURE
DISORDER
THE
PARENTS
NOTICED
THAT
ONE
THING
THAT
WOULD
PRECIPITATE
A
SEIZURE
WAS
A
MEAL
WITH
CORN
IN
IT
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
WONDERED
ABOUT
THE
CONNECTION
AND
FURTHER
ABOUT
OTHER
DIETARY
INGREDIENTS
THAT
MIGHT
PRECIPITATE
SEIZURES
OTHER
EXPERIENCES
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
