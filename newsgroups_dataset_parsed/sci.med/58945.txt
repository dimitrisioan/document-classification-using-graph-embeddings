once

we
are
waiting
i
have
been
thinking
that
it
would
be
good
to
get
to
as
large
a
group
as
possible
to
see
if
anyone
has
any
experience
with
this
kind
of
thing
i
know
that
members
of
the
medical
community
are
sometimes
loathe
to
admit
the
importance
that
diet
and
foods
play
in
our
general
health
and
wellbeing
anyway
as
you
can
guess
i
am
worried
sick
about
this
and
would
appreciate
any
ideas
anyone
out
there
has
sorry
to
be
so
wordy
but
i
wanted
to
really
get
across
what
is
going
on
here
i
dont
know
anything
specifically
but
i
have
one
further
anecdote
a
colleague
of
mine
had
a
child
with
a
serious
congenital
disease
tuberous
sclerosis
along
with
mental
retardation
comes
a
serious
seizure
disorder
the
parents
noticed
that
one
thing
that
would
precipitate
a
seizure
was
a
meal
with
corn
in
it
i
have
always
wondered
about
the
connection
and
further
about
other
dietary
ingredients
that
might
precipitate
seizures
other
experiences
would
be
interesting
to
hear
about
from
netters
