WRITES
MY
MOTHER
HAS
BEEN
ADVISED
TO
HAVE
A
BONE
SCAN
PERFORMED
WHAT
IS
THIS
PROCEDURE
FOR
AND
IS
IT
PAINFUL
SHES
BEEN
HAVING
LEG
AND
BACK
PAIN
WHICH
HER
GP
SAID
WAS
SCIATICA
HER
ONCOLOGIST
LISTENED
TO
HER
SYMPTOMS
AND
SAID
THAT
IT
DIDNT
SOUND
LIKE
SCIATICA
AND
SHE
SHOULD
GET
A
BONE
SCAN
DO
I
ASSUME
CORRECTLY
FROM
THE
ABOVE
ARICLE
THAT
YOUR
MOTHER
HAS
A
HISTORYY
OF
CANCER
I
WAS
JUST
WONDEING
SINCE
YOU
MENTIONED
THHAT
SHE
HAS
AN
ONCOLOGIST
A
BONE
SCAN
IS
A
NUCLEAR
SCAN
THPERSON
RECEIVVING
THE
SCAN
IS
GVEN
A
DOSE
OF
A
RADIOACTIVE
TRACER
AND
AN
IMAGING
DEVICE
IS
USED
TO
TRACK
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
THE
TRACER
WWITHIN
THE
BODY
THE
TRACER
IS
USUALLY
GIVEN
INTRAVENOUSLY
IV
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
PHYSICIAN
OR
HIS
ASSISTANT
WILL
INSERT
A
NEEDLE
INTO
A
VEIN
AND
INJECT
MEDICINE
INTO
THE
VEIN
AFTER
A
FEW
MINUTES
HAS
PASSED
FOR
THE
TRACER
TO
CIRCULATE
THROUGH
THE
BODY
THE
PERSON
IS
SCANNED
WITH
AN
IMAGING
DEVICE
TO
DETECT
HIGH
CONCENTRATIONS
OF
THE
TRACER
THE
RADIOLOGIST
OR
DOCTOR
IS
LOOKING
FOR
AREAS
THAT
TAKE
UP
MORE
OF
THE
RADIOACTIVE
TRACER
OR
LESS
OF
IT
AS
FAR
AS
PAIN
THE
ONLY
PAIN
COMES
FROM
THE
NEEDLE
STICK
THAT
IS
REQUIRED
TO
START
THE
IV
LINE
WHAT
THE
DOCTOR
IS
PROBABLY
LOOKING
FOR
ARE
CHANGES
IN
THE
BONES
THAT
MAY
HAVE
RESULTED
FROM
CANCER
THIS
IS
ALSO
WHY
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
YOUR
MOTHER
HAS
HAD
CANCER
SINCE
CANCER
CAN
SPREAD
FROM
ONE
SITE
AND
WIND
UP
IN
THE
SKELETAL
SYSTEM
