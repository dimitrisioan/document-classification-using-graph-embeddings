scimed
removed
from
followups
and
i
do
not
read
any
of
the
other
newsgroups

writes
as
a
selfproclaimed
atheist
my
position
is
that
i
believe
that
there
is
no
god
i
dont
claim
to
have
any
proof
i
interpret
the
agnostic
position
as
having
no
beliefs
about
gods
existence
thats
fine
these
words
have
multiple
meanings
as
a
selfproclaimed
atheist
i
believe
that
some
conceptions
of
god
are
inconsistent
or
in
conflict
with
fact
and
i
lack
belief
in
other
conceptions
of
god
merely
because
there
is
no
reason
for
me
to
believe
in
these
i
usually
use
the
word
agnostic
to
mean
someone
who
believes
that
the
existence
of
a
god
is
unknown
inherently
unknowable
note
that
this
is
a
positive
belief
that
is
quite
different
from
not
believing
in
a
god
i
do
not
believe
in
a
god
but
i
also
do
not
believe
the
agnostic
claim
