MEANING
OF
ATHEISM
AGNOSTICISM
WAS
KRILLEAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
SCIMED
REMOVED
FROM
FOLLOWUPS
AND
I
DO
NOT
READ
ANY
OF
THE
OTHER
NEWSGROUPS
IN
ARTICLE
GRANTEAQUARIUSROSEMOUNTCOM
GRANT
EDWARDS
WRITES
AS
A
SELFPROCLAIMED
ATHEIST
MY
POSITION
IS
THAT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
GOD
I
DONT
CLAIM
TO
HAVE
ANY
PROOF
I
INTERPRET
THE
AGNOSTIC
POSITION
AS
HAVING
NO
BELIEFS
ABOUT
GODS
EXISTENCE
THATS
FINE
THESE
WORDS
HAVE
MULTIPLE
MEANINGS
AS
A
SELFPROCLAIMED
ATHEIST
I
BELIEVE
THAT
SOME
CONCEPTIONS
OF
GOD
ARE
INCONSISTENT
OR
IN
CONFLICT
WITH
FACT
AND
I
LACK
BELIEF
IN
OTHER
CONCEPTIONS
OF
GOD
MERELY
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
FOR
ME
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THESE
I
USUALLY
USE
THE
WORD
AGNOSTIC
TO
MEAN
SOMEONE
WHO
BELIEVES
THAT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
GOD
IS
UNKNOWN
INHERENTLY
UNKNOWABLE
NOTE
THAT
THIS
IS
A
POSITIVE
BELIEF
THAT
IS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
NOT
BELIEVING
IN
A
GOD
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
A
GOD
BUT
I
ALSO
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THE
AGNOSTIC
CLAIM
