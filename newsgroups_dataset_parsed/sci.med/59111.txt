THE
FACT
THAT
THIS
HAPPENED
WHILE
EATING
TWO
SUGAR
COATED
CEREALS
MADE

MAKES
ME
THINK
SHE
MIGHT
BE
HAVING
AN
ALLERGIC
REACTION
TO
SOMETHING
IN
THE
COATING

THE

BUT
WE
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
ALLERGIES
IN
OUR
FAMILY
HISTORY
INCLUDING
SOME
WEIRD
FOOD
ALLERGIES
NUTS
MUSHROOMS
MANY
OF
THESE
CEREALS
ARE
CORNBASED
AFTER
YOUR
POST
I
LOOKED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
AND
LOCATED
TWO
ARTICLES
THAT
IMPLICATED
CORN
CONTAINS
TRYPTOPHAN
AND
SEIZURES
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
CORN
IN
THE
DIET
MIGHT
POTENTIATE
AN
ALREADY
EXISTING
OR
LATENT
SEIZURE
DISORDER
NOT
CAUSE
IT
CHECK
TO
SEE
IF
THE
