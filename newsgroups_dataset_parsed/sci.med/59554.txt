MY

VITAMIN

IS

GETTING

GOOD
REASON
THE

NUMEROUS

IF

NOT

PREVENT

CURE

ITS

INFECTION

ALMOST
IDENTICALBUT

BECAUSE
THE

WHEN

YOU
WILL
NOT

BECAUSE
THE
ENXZYME

THE

HIGHER
DOSE

THAT

I
DONT

THEN
YOU
WOULD
BE

BUT
MY
KNOWLEDGE

SUGGESTS
TO
ME
THAT
FOR
PATIENTS

IF

TO

NEVER

NEVER
HAVE
THIS
EFFECT
ON
THE

FETUS
COULD
JUST
TAKING
BETACAROTENE
INSTEAD
OF
RETINOL
SUPPLEMENTS
HELP
YES
BUT
THE
EFFECT
WILL
TAKE
A
LONG
TIME
TO
DEVELOP
MY
ADVISE
IS
TO
USE
RETINOL
TO
FILL
THE
LIVER
UP
AND
THEN
SWITCH
TO
BETACAROTENE
TO
KEEP
IT
FULL
VITAMIN
A
IS
PROBABLY
ONE
NUTRIENT
THAT
IS
BETTER
OFF
LEFT
TO

BY

BUT
WHEN
WE
HAVE
THE

THINK
THAT

TO
