JOSH
SCHWIMMER
WRITES
IVE
RECENTLY
LISTENED
TO
A
TAPE
BY
DR
STANISLAW
BURZYNSKI
IN
WHICH
HE
CLAIMS
TO
HAVE
DISCOVERED
A
SERIES
NATURALLY
OCCURING
PEPTIDES
WITH
ANTI
CANCER
PROPERTIES
THAT
HE
NAMES
ANTINEOPLASTONS
BURZYNSKI
SAYS
THAT
HIS
WORK
HAS
MET
WITH
HOSTILITY
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
DESPITE
THE
FAVORABLE
RESPONSES
OF
HIS
SUBJECTS
DURING
CLINICAL
TRIALS
WHAT
IS
THE
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
OPINION
OF
DR
BURZYNSKIS
RESEARCH
HE
PAINTS
HIMSELF
AS
A
LONE
RESEARCHER
WITH
A
NEW
BREAKTHROUGH
BATTLING
AN
INTOLERANT
MEDICAL
ESTABLISHMENT
BUT
I
HAVE
NO
BASIS
FROM
WHICH
TO
JUDGE
HIS
CLAIMS
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
HOWEVER
I
READ
THAT
THE
NIHS
DEPARTMENT
OF
ALTERNATIVE
MEDICINE
HAS
DECIDED
TO
FOCUS
THEIR
ATTENTION
ON
BURZYNSKIS
WORK
THEIR
BUDGET
IS
SO
SMALL
THAT
I
IMAGINE
THEY
WOULDNT
INVESTIGATE
A
TREATMENT
THAT
DIDNT
SEEM
PROMISING
ANY
OPINIONS
ON
BURZYNSKIS
ANTINEOPLASTONS
OR
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
CURRENT
STATUS
OF
HIS
RESEARCH
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED

THERES
BEEN
EXTENSIVE
DISCUSSION
ON
THE
COMPUSERVE
CANCER
FORUM
ABOUT
DR
BURZYNSKIS
TREATMENT
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
DECISION
OF
A
FORUM
MEMBERS
FATHER
TO
UNDERTAKE
HIS
TREATMENT
FOR
BRAIN
GLIOBLASTOMA
THIS
DISEASE
IS
UNIVERSALLY
AND
USUALLY
RAPIDLY
FATAL
AFTER
DIAGNOSIS
IN
JUNE
THE
TUMOR
WAS
GROWING
RAPIDLY
DESPITE
RADIATION
AND
CHEMOTHERAPY
THE
FORUM
MEMBER
CHECKED
EXTENSIVELY
ON
DR
BURZYNKIS
TRACK
RECORD
FOR
THIS
DISEASE
HE
SPOKE
TO
A
FEW
PATIENTS
IN
COMPLETE
REMISSION
FOR
A
FEW
YEARS
FROM
GLIOBLASTOMA
FOLLOWING
THIS
TREATMENT
AND
TO
AN
NCI
ONCOLOGIST
WHO
HAD
AUDITED
OTHER
SUCH
CASE
HISTORIES
AND
FOUND
THEM
VALID
AND
IMPRESSIVE
AFTER
THE

ALL
SUBSEQUENT
