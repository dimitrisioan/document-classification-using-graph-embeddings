information

reflux
esophagitis
the

of
a
doctors

specialize
in
such
surgery
information
on
reflux
esophagitis
which
leads
to
cancer
my
boyfriend
age
and
otherwise
in
good
health
was
diagnosed
with
reflux
esophagitis
and
a
hiatal
hernia
about
years
ago
at
that
time
he
saw
a
gastroenterologist
and
has
tried
acid
controllers
mylanta
tagamet
as
well
as
a
restricted
diet
and
raising
the
head
of
his
bed
these
treatments
were
not
effective
and
because
the
damage
was
worsening
he
opted
for
a
surgical
repair
months
ago
he
was
told
there
were
two
repair
techniques
that
could
fix
the
problem
a
nissen
wrap
and
a
hill
repair
he
opted
for
the
hill
repair
he
recovered
very
well
from
the
surgery
itself
but
the
pain
he
had
originally
is
worse
and
in
addition
he
now
has
trouble
swallowing
including
saliva
the
doctor
now
wants
to
do
an
endoscopy
and
has
also
informed
him
that
a
biopsy
might
be
necessary
if
he
has
a
precancerous
condition
which
he
called
barretts
syndrome
if
he
cant
avoid
having
reflux
will
he
necessarily
get
cancer
basically
if
anyone
has
any
information
on
what
he
should
do
now
id
appreciate
it
thanks
