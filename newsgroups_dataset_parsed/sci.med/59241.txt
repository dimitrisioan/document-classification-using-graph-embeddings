ps
may
i
suggest
seriously
that
if
the
doctors
and
wannabedoctors
on
the
net
who
refuse
to
have
an
open
mind
on
alternative
treatments
and
theories
such
as
the
yeast
theory
should
create
your
own
moderated
group
why
is
there
some
reason
why
you
feel
that
it
shouldnt
be
pointed
out
in
scimed
that
there
is
no
convincing
empirical
evidence
to
support
the
existence
of
systemic
yeast
syndrome
i
dont
know
the
first
thing
about
yeast
infections
but
i
am
a
scientist
no
scientist
would
take
your
statement
no
convincing
empirical
evidence
to
support
the
existence
of
systemic
yeast
syndrome
to
tell
you
anything
except
an
absence
of
data
on
the
question
noring
has
pointed
out
the
that
if
the
crazy
theory
were
true
you
probably
couldnt
find
any
direct
evidence
of
it
that
you
couldnt
observe
those
yeastie
beasties
with
present
methods
even
if
they
were
there
noring
and
the
fellow
from
oklahoma
sorry
forgot
your
name
have
also
suggested
one
set
of
anecdotal
evidence
in
favor
based
on
their
personal
experiences
namely
that
when
people
with
certain
conditions
are
given
antifungals
many
of
them
appear
to
get
better
so
if
you
have
any
evidence
against
the
hypothesis
for
example
controlled
doubleblind
studies
showing
that
the
antifungals
dont
do
any
better
than
sugar
water
then
lets
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdotal
and
uncontrolled
evidence
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
in
which
case
please
there
is
no
point
in
yelling
back
and
forth
at
each
other
any
longer
since
neither
side
has
any
convincing
evidence
either
positive
or
negative
and
i
understand
that
your
abject
disbelief
is
based
on
the
existence
of
people
who
may
get
famous
or
make
money
applying
the
diagnosis
to
everything
in
sight
making
wild
claims
with
no
evidence
and
always
refusing
to
do
controlled
studies
but
that
has
absolutely
no
bearing
on
the
apparently
sincere
experiences
of
the
people
on
the
net
observing
antifungals
working
on
themselves
and
other
people
in
certain
specific
cases
there
are
also
quacks
who
sell
oral
superoxide
dismutase
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
its
completely
broken
down
in
the
guts
but
this
doesnt
change
the
genuine
scientific
knowledge
about
the
role
of
superoxide
dismutase
in
fighting
oxidative
damage
same
thing
just
cause
there
are
candida
quacks
that
doesnt
establish
evidence
against
the
candida
hypothesis
if
theres
some
other
reason
besides
the
quacks
if
only
anecdotal
to
think
it
could
be
true
then
that
is
what
has
to
be
considered
that
is
what
the
net
people
have
been
talking
about
but
again
there
is
no
point
in
arguing
about
it
there
is
anecdotal
evidence
and
there
is
no
convincing
evidence
and
there
are
also
some
candida
quacks
out
there
i
hope
everyone
can
agree
on
all
of
that
thus
it
appears
to
me
the
main
question
now
is
whether
the
proponents
can
marshall
enough
anecdotal
evidence
in
a
convincing
and
documented
enough
manner
to
make
a
good
case
for
carrying
out
a
good
controlled
doubleblind
study
of
antifungals
or
else
forget
convincing
anybody
else
to
carry
out
the
test
just
carry
it
out
themselves
and
also
whether
they
can
adequately
define
the
patient
population
or
symptoms
on
which
such
a
study
should
be
carried
out
to
provide
a
fair
test
of
the
hypothesis
