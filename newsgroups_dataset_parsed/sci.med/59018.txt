RE
BURSITIS
AND
LASER
TREATMENT
IN
ARTICLE
ROBERT
ALLISON
WRITES
MY
FAMILY
DOCTOR
AND
THE
PHYSIOTHERAPIST
PT
SHE
SENT
ME
TO
AGREE
THAT
THE
PAIN
IN
MY
LEFT
SHOULDER
IS
BURSITIS
I
HAVE
AN
APPOINTMENT
WITH
AN
ORTHPOD
I
LOVE
THAT
ITS
SHORT
FOR
ORTHOPEDIC
SURGEON
APPARENTLY
BUT
WHILE
IM
WAITING
THE
PT
IS
TREATING
ME
SHES
USING
HOT
PACKS
ULTRASOUND
AND
LASERS
BUT
THERES
NO
IMPROVEMENT
YET
IN
FACT
I
ALMOST
SUSPECT
ITS
GETTING
WORSE
MY
REAL
QUESTION
IS
ABOUT
THE
LASER
TREATMENT
I
CANT
EASILY
IMAGINE
WHAT
THE
PHYSICAL
EFFECT
THAT
COULD
HAVE
ON
A
DEEP
TISSUE
PROBLEM
CAN
ANYONE
SHED
SOME
LIGHT
SO
TO
SPEAK
ON
THE
MATTER
IF
IT
WORKS
ITS
ONLY
DUE
TO
THE
HEAT
PRODUCED
BY
THE
LASER
PHILIPPE
