RE
FOODRELATED
SEIZURES
I
REMEMBER
HEARING
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
ABOUT
A
NEW
THERAPY
FOR
HYPERACTIVITY
WHICH
INVOLVED
AGGRESSIVELY
ELIMINATING
ARTIFICIAL
COLORING
AND
FLAVORING
FROM
THE
DIET
THE
THEORY
WHICH
WAS
BACKED
UP
BY
INTERESTING
ANECDOTAL
RESULTS
IS
THAT
CERTAIN
PEOPLE
ARE
JUST
WAY
MORE
SENSITIVE
TO
THESE
CHEMICALS
THAN
OTHER
PEOPLE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
ANY
CONNECTION
BEING
MADE
WITH
SEIZURES
BUT
IT
CERTAINLY
COULDNT
HURT
TO
TRY
AN
ALLNATURAL
DIET
