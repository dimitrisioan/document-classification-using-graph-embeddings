am
i
justified
in
being
pissed
off
at
this
doctor
last
saturday
evening
my
year
old
son
cut
his
finger
badly
with
a
knife
i
took
him
to
a
local
urgent
and
general
care
clinic
at
pm
the
clinic
was
open
till
pm
the
receptionist
went
to
the
back
and
told
the
other
good
stuff
about
the
drs
idiocy
ok
much
as
i
hate
to
do
it
here
i
am
posting
an
even
better
dr
idiot
story
i
was
in
my
hour
of
labor
had
been
pushing
for
hours
and
was
exhausted
my
ob
and
i
decided
to
go
for
a
csec
the
ob
called
in
the
anesthisiologist
sp
and
asked
him
to
help
prep
me
for
surgery
after
watching
me
go
through
a
couple
contractions
the
anes
or
anus
as
i
like
to
refer
to
him
said
well
i
am
off
duty
now
still
staring
between
my
legs
at
that
the
ob
asked
to
go
call
whomever
it
was
who
was
on
duty
and
ask
himher
how
long
it
would
takeand
if
it
was
going
to
take
more
than
a
few
minutes
to
please
stay
even
though
he
was
off
duty
the
anes
went
out
supposedly
to
call
the
oncall
anes
in
a
couple
of
minutes
the
nurse
came
running
in
to
tell
the
ob
that
the
anes
had
left
without
even
trying
to
get
ahold
of
the
oncall
it
was
the
only
time
during
my
labor
that
i
swore
the
oncall
anes
took
minutes
to
get
there
come
to
find
out
the
anes
had
only
just
gone
off
duty
about
minutes
before
and
technically
was
supposed
to
stay
in
the
hospital
until
the
next
oncall
got
there
good
thing
for
all
of
us
especially
him
that
it
was
not
a
critical
emergency
but
boy
would
i
love
to
knock
that
fellows
ouchie
places
just
to
let
him
be
in
pain
a
few
little
minutes
i
have
run
into
dr
idiots
mechanic
idiots
clerk
idiots
and
etc
idiots
in
my
time
but
this
fellow
i
would
like
to
have
words
with
deantha
