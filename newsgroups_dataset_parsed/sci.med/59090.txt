ACUTANE
FIBROMYALGIA
SYNDROME
AND
CFS
DANIEL
PRINCE
WROTE
I
THINK
THEY
SHOULD
RENAME
WACO
TX
TO
WACKO
TX
I
KNOW
IT
IS
JUST
A
JOKE
BUT
PLEASE
REMEMBER
THE
PEOPLE
OF
WACO
DID
NOT
ASK
DAVID
KORESH
TO
BE
A
LUNATIC
THERE
HE
JUST
HAPPENED
WACO
IS
A
LOVELY
TOWN
I
WOULD
THINK
SOMEONE
LIVING
IN
THE
HOME
OF
FLAKES
AND
NUT
WOULD
BE
MORE
SENSITIVE
