just
had
the
opportunity
to
watch
this
flick
on
ae
some
years
since
i
saw
it
last
wow
the
wwii
channel
did
something
notwwii
i
was
very
interested
in
the
technology
demonstrated
in
this
film
for
handling
infectious
diseases
and
similar
toxic
substances
clearly
they
faked
a
lot
of
the
computer
robotic
technology
certainly
at
the
time
it
was
made
most
of
that
was
science
fiction
itself
let
alone
the
idea
of
a
space
germ
the
graphics
capabilities
of
the
computers
were
very
faked
for
movie
audiences
who
have
not
ability
or
patience
with
numbers
the
book
was
more
realistic
in
that
respect
in
all
respects
actually
the
robotics
are
still
out
of
range
but
not
impossible
quite
coincidentally
actually
this
is
what
got
me
wanted
to
see
the
movie
again
i
watched
a
segment
on
the
otherwise
awful
howd
they
do
that
dealing
with
a
disease
researcher
at
the
cdcs
top
lab
there
was
description
of
the
elaborate
security
measures
taken
so
that
building
will
never
be
cracked
so
to
speak
by
man
or
nature
short
of
deliberate
bombing
from
the
air
perhaps
and
the
researchers
used
spacesuits
similar
to
that
in
the
film
sf
and
ive
always
wondered
how
crichton
escapes
this
classification
is
usually
ahead
of
science
in
both
prediction
and
precaution
nasas
decontaimination
processes
were
supposedly
taken
to
prevent
sf
story
disasters
i
mean
nasa
scientists
were
often
sf
readers
and
sometimes
writers
and
felt
prewarned
by
their
reading
im
curious
what
people
think
about
this
film
short
of
silly
is
such
a
facility
technically
feasible
today
i
think
the
film
still
holds
up
among
the
best
of
sf
films
but
that
isnt
saying
a
whole
lot
as
far
as
the
plot
and
the
crystalline
structure
that
is
not
life
as
we
know
it
thats
a
whole
nother
argument
for
recartssftech
or
something
yep
