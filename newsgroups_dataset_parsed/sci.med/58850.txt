THERE

I
HATE
TO
BREAK
THIS

THEY

AS
WELL
YET
AGAIN
THE
USE
OF
THIS

IS
HAMPERED
BY

NOT
RESTRICTING
THEIR

TO

THEY
HAVE
SUBSTANTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
OF

SOMEONE
WHO
CAN
READ
A
SCIENTIFIC

AND
APPARENTLY
COME
AWAY
FROM
IT
WITH
BIZARRELY
CRACKED
IDEAS
WHICH
HAVE
NOTHING
TO

WITH
THE

ON
MSG
LOOK
UP
ALMOST
ANYTHING
BY
JOHN
W
OLNEY
A
TOXICOLOGIST
WHO
HAS
STUDIED
THE
EFFECTS
OF
MSG
ON
THE
BRAIN
AND
ON
DEVELOPMENT
IT
IS
UNDISPUTED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
MSG
IS
AN
EXCITOTOXIC
FOOD
ADDITIVE
NO
ITS
UNDISPUTED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
GLUTAMATE
IS
AN
AMINO
ACID
WHICH
IS
AN
EXCITATORY
NEUROTRANSMITTER
THERE
IS
ALSO
EVIDENCE
THAT
EXCESSIVE
RELEASE
OF
GLUTAMATE
MAY
BE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PATHOLOGY
OF
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
LIKE
STROKE
DROWNING
AND
LOU
GEHRIGS
DISEASE
JUST
TO
NAME
A
FEW
THIS
IS
A
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
ISSUE
THAN
THE
USE
OF
THIS
UBIQUITOUS
AMINO
ACID
IN
FOODS
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
RECEIVING
INTRAVENTRICULAR
INJECTIONS
OF
GLUTAMATE
AND
THAT
ITS
MAJOR
CONSTITUENT
GLUTAMATE
IS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
PREMIERIE
NEUROTRANSMITTER
IN
THE
MAMMALIAN
BRAIN
HUMANS
INCLUDED
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
PREMIER
BUT
ITS
CERTAINLY
AN
IMPORTANT
ONE
TOO
MUCH
IN
THE
DIET
AND
THE
SYSTEM
GETS
THROWN
OFF
SEZ
YOU
SUCH
AN
EFFECT
IN
HUMANS
HAS
NOT
BEEN
DEMONSTRATED
IN
ANY
CONTROLLED
STUDIES
INFANT
MICE
AND
OTHER
MODELS
ARE
USEFUL
AS
FAR
AS
THEY
GO
BUT
THEYRE
NOT
RELEVANT
TO
THE
MATTER
AT
HAND
WHICH
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
I
FAVOR
ITS
USE
IN
THINGS
LIKE
BABY
FOODA
PATENTLY
RIDICULOUS
USE
OF
THE

BUT
WE
HAVE
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
MSG
IN
THE

EFFECTS
HUMANS
ADVERSELY
GLUTAMATE
AND
ASPARTATE
ALSO
AN
EXCITOTOXIN
ARE
NECESSARY
IN
SMALL
AMOUNTS
AND
ARE
FREELY
AVAILABLE
IN
MANY
FOODS
BUT
THE
AMOUNTS
ADDED
BY

ARE
FAR
ABOVE
THE
AMOUNTS
THAT
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
ENCOUNTERED
IN

DO
YOU

HOW

COMPARE
THAT
TO

YOU
