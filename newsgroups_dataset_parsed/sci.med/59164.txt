THINKING
THAT

OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
INVOLVES
TAKING
PICTURES
OF
AN
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
ORGANIC
OBJECT
BETWEEN
CHARGED

THE
PICTURE
WILL
SHOW
ENERGY

SPIKES
AROUND
THE

DEPENDING
ON
WHAT
TYPE
OF
OBJECT
IT
IS
THE
SPIKES

VARY
ONE
MIGHT
EXTRAPOLATE
HERE
AND
SAY
THAT
THIS
PROVES
THAT
EVERY
OBJECT
WITHIN
THE
UNIVERSE
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
HAS
ITS
OWN

CONSTRUCT
