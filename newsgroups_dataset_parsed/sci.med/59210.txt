writes
from
miranda
castro
the
complete
homeopathy
handbook
isbn
oringinally
published
in
britain
in
from
page
and
in
when
the
national
health
service
was
established
homeopathy
was
included
as
an
officially
approved
method
of
treatment
i
was
there
in
i
suppose
it
must
have
died
out
since
then
certainly
i
never
heard
of
any
homeopaths
or
herbalists
in
the
employ
of
the
nhs
perhaps
the
law
codified
it
but
the
authorities
refused
to
hire
any
homeopaths
a
similar
law
in
the
us
allows
chiropractors
to
practice
in
va
hospitals
but
ive
never
seen
one
there
and
i
dont
know
of
a
single
va
that
has
hired
a
chiropractor
there
are
a
lot
of
britons
on
the
net
so
someone
should
be
able
to
tell
us
if
the
nhs
provides
homeopaths
for
you
gordon
banks
skepticism
is
the
chastity
of
the
intellect
and
gebcadredslpittedu
it
is
shameful
to
surrender
it
too
soon
