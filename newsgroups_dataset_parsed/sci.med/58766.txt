about
major

both

april
internal
epa
data
released
today
by
the
natural
resources
defense
council
reveals
that
about
large
water
systems
serving
cities
from
boston
to
san
francisco
do
not
filter
to
remove
diseasecarrying
organisms
leaving
those
communities
potentially
vulnerable
to
a
disease
outbreak
similar
to
the
one
affecting
milwaukee
the
epa
list
is
attached
these
internal
epa
documents
reveal
that
the
safety
of
water
supplies
in
many
american
cities
is
threatened
by
inadequate
pollution
controls
or
filtration
said
erik
olson
a
senior
attorney
with
nrdc
water
contamination
isnt
just
a
problem
in
bangladesh
its
also
a
problem
in
bozeman
and
boston
as
of
june
about
large
surface
water
systems
on
epas
list
probably
will
be
breaking
the
law
the
safe
drinking
water
act
requires
all
surface
water
systems
to
either
filter
their
water
or
fully
protect
the
rivers
or
lakes
they
use
from
pollution
olson
continued
some
systems
are
moving
towards
eventually
implementing
filtration
systems
but
are
expected
to
miss
the
laws
deadline
olson
pointed
out
that
the
threat
of
contamination
is
already
a
reality
in
other
cities
a
survey
of
us
surface
water
systems
by
water
utility
scientists
found
that
percent
of
raw
water
samples
contained
the
milwaukee
organism
cryptosporidium
and
percent
contained
a
similar
parasite
called
giardia
adding
to
the
level
of
concern
a
general
accounting
office
study
released
today
by
house
health
and
environment
subcommittee
chairman
henry
waxman
indicates
serious
deficiencies
in
the
nations
system
for
conducting
and
following
through
on
sanitary
surveys
of
water
systems
this
new
information
raises
a
huge
warning
sign
that
millions
of
americans
can
no
longer
simply
turn
on
their
taps
and
be
assured
that
their
water
is
safe
to
drink
we
must
immediately
put
into
place
programs
to
protect
water
sources
from
contamination
and
where
this
is
not
assured
filtration
equipment
must
be
installed
to
protect
the
public
olson
noted
the
time
has
come
for
many
of
the
nations
water
utilities
to
stop
dragging
their
feet
and
to
aggressively
protect
their
water
from
contamination
consumers
are
prepared
to
pay
the
modest
costs
needed
to
assure
their
water
is
safe
to
drink
nrdc
is
a
national
nonprofit
environmental
advocacy
organization
systems
epa
indicates
require
filtration
and
do
not
adequately
protect
