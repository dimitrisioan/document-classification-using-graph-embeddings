re
eugenics
probably
within
years
a
new
type
of
eugenics
will
be
possible
maybe
even
sooner
we
are
now
mapping
the
human
genome
we
will
then
start
to
work
on
manipulation
of
that
genome
using
genetic
engineering
we
will
be
able
to
insert
whatever
genes
we
want
no
breeding
no
hybrids
etc
the
ethical
question
is
should
we
do
this
should
we
make
a
race
of
diseasefree
longlived
arnold
schwartzeneggermuscled
supermen
even
if
we

it
is
shameful
