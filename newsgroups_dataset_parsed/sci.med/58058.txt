smokers
lungs
to
clear

after
quitting
does
your
chances
of
getting
lung
cancer
decrease
quickly
or
does
it
take
a
considerable
amount
of
time
for
that
to
happen
the
answer
to
your
first
question
is
rather
difficult
to
answer
without
doing
a
lot
of
autopsies
the
second
question
is
something
thats
been
known
for
some
time
it
appears
that
within
about
years
of
quitting
smoking
a
persons
risk
for
developing
lung
cancer
drops
to
that
of
the
person
who
never
smoked
assuming
you
do
not
get
lung
cancer
in
the
interim
the
risk
to
someone
who
smoked
the
equivalent
of
a
pack
per
day
for
years
is
around
times
as
high
as
a
nonsmoker
still
rather
low
overall
but
significant
personally
id
be
more
concerned
about
heart
disease
secondary
to
smoking
its
much
more
common
and
even
a
small
increase
in
risk
is
significant
