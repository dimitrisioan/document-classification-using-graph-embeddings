DEFINITELY
INTENDED
HERE
BILL
WAS
MAKING
FUN
OF
THE
MISSPELLING
GO
LOOK
UP
THE
WORD
KRILL
ALSO
THE
CORRECT
SPELLING
IS
KIRLIAN
IT
INVOLVES
TAKING
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
CORONA
DISCHARGES
CREATED
BY
ATTACHING
THE
SUBJECT
TO
A
HIGHVOLTAGE
SOURCE
NOT
OF
SOME
AURA
IT
WORKS
EQUALLY
WELL
WITH
INANIMATE
OBJECTS
TRUE
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
SHOWING
THE
MISSING
PART
OF
A
LEAF
IS
THIS
CORONA
DISCHARGE
YUP
THE
DEMONSTRATION
TO
WHICH
YOU
REFER
CONSISTS
OF
PLACING
A
LEAF
BETWEEN
THE
PLATES
AND
TAKING
A
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPH
OF
IT
YOU
THEN
CUT
OFF
PART
OF
THE
LEAF
PUT
THE
TOP
PLATE
BACK
ON
AND
TAKE
ANOTHER
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPH
YOU
SEE
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
IMAGE
IN
BOTH
CASES
TURNS
OUT
THE
EFFECT
ISNT
NEARLY
SO
STRIKING
IF
YOU
TAKE
THE
TROUBLE
TO
CLEAN
THE
PLATES
BETWEEN
PHOTOGRAPHS
SEEMS
THAT
THE
MOISTURE
FROM
THE
LEAF
THAT
YOU
LEFT
