that

allow

to
take
krillean
pictures
its
kirlian
krillean
pictures
are
portraits
of
tiny
shrimp
one
might
extrapolate
here
and
say
that
this
proves
that
every
object
within
the
universe
as
we
know
it
has
its
own
energy
signature
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
anything
thats
not
at
degrees
kelvin
will
have
its
own
energy
signature
the
interesting
questions
are
what
kind
of
energy
and
what
it
signifies

the
russian
engineer
semyon
kirlian
and
his
wife
valentina
during
the
using
alternating
currents
of
high
frequency
to
illuminate
their
subjects
they
photographed
them
they
found
that
if
an
object
was
a
good
conductor
such
as
a
metal
the
picture
showed
only
its
surface
while
the
pictures
of
poor
conductors
showed
the
inner
structure
of
the
object
even
if
it
were
optically
opaque
they
found
too
that
these
high
frequency
pictures
could
distinguish
between
dead
and
living
objects
dead
ones
had
a
constant
outline
whilst
living
ones
were
subject
to
changes
the
objects
life
activity
was
also
visible
in
highly
variable
colour
patterns
high
frequency
photography
has
now
been
practised
for
twenty
years
in
the
soviet
union
but
only
a
few
people
in
the
west
have
taken
it
up
seriously
professor
douglas
dean
in
new
york
and
professor
philips
at
washington
university
in
st
louis
have
produced
kirlian
photographs
and
others
have
been
produced
in
brazil
austria
and
germany
using
kirlian
photography
it
is
possible
to
show
an
aura
around
peoples
fingers
notably
around
those
of
healers
who
are
concentrating
on
healing
someone
normally
blue
and
white
rays
emanate
from
the
fingers
but
when
a
subject
becomes
angry
or
excited
the
aura
turns
red
and
spotty
the
soviets
are
now
using
kirlian
photography
to
diagnose
diseases
which
cannot
be
diagnosed
by
any
other
method
they
argue
that
in
most
illnesses
there
is
a
preclinical
stage
during
which
the
person
isnt
actually
ill
but
is
about
to
be
they
claim
to
be
able
to
foretell
a
disease
by
photographing
its
preclinical
phase
but
the
most
exciting
phenomenon
illustrated
by
kirlian
photography
is
the
phantom
effect
during
high
frequency
photography
of
a
leaf
from
which
a
part
had
been
cut
the
photograph
gave
a
complete
picture
of
the
leaf
with
the
removed
part
showing
up
faintly
this
is
extremely
important
because
it
backs
up
the
experiences
of
psychics
who
can
see
the
legs
of
amputees
as
if
they
were
still
there
the
important
thing
about
the
kirlian
phantoms
though
is
that
the
electromagnetic
pattern
cant
possibly
represent
a
secondary
phenomenon
or
the
field
would
vanish
when
the
piece
of
leaf
or
leg
vanished
the
energy
grid
contained
in
a
living
object
must
therefore
be
far
more
significant
than
the
actual
object
itself
kirlian
photography
has
shown
how
water
mentally
charged
by
a
healer
has
a
much
richer
energy
field
around
it
than
ordinary
water
from
the
incredulous
side

kirlian

common
knowledge

for
a
century
it
took
a
lone
basement
crank
to
declare
that
the
sparks
represent
some
sort
of
spiritual
aura

fact
kirlian
photography
was
subjected
to
rigorous
testing
by

john

harry

kyler
and
david
l
faust
who
reported
their
findings
in
the
october
issue
of
science
their
conclusion
the
variations
observed
in
kirlian
photographs
are
due
solely
to
moisture
on
the
surface
of
the
body
and
not
to
mysterious
auras
or
even
necessarily
to
changes
in
mood
or
mental
state
nevertheless
television
shows
magazines
and
books
many
by
famous
parapsychologists
continue
to
promote
kirlian
photography
as
proof
of
the
unknown
