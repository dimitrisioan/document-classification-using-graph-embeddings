PROVES
THAT

THINK
ITS

TO

IF

THE

SHOWED
ONLY

THE

OF

SHOWED
THE

OF
THE

EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
OPTICALLY

FOUND
TOO

SERIOUSLY

WHEN

THE

TURNS

THE
SOVIETS
ARE
NOW
USING
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
TO
DIAGNOSE
DISEASES
WHICH
CANNOT
BE
DIAGNOSED
BY
ANY
OTHER
METHOD
THEY
ARGUE
THAT
IN
MOST
ILLNESSES
THERE
IS
A
PRECLINICAL
STAGE
DURING
WHICH
THE
PERSON
ISNT
ACTUALLY
ILL
BUT
IS
ABOUT
TO
BE
THEY
CLAIM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
FORETELL
A
DISEASE
BY
PHOTOGRAPHING
ITS
PRECLINICAL
PHASE
BUT
THE
MOST
EXCITING
PHENOMENON
ILLUSTRATED
BY
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
IS
THE
PHANTOM
EFFECT
DURING
HIGH
FREQUENCY
PHOTOGRAPHY
OF
A
LEAF
FROM
WHICH
A
PART
HAD
BEEN
CUT
THE
PHOTOGRAPH
GAVE
A
COMPLETE
PICTURE
OF
THE
LEAF
WITH
THE
REMOVED
PART
SHOWING
UP
FAINTLY
THIS
IS
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
BECAUSE
IT
BACKS
UP
THE
EXPERIENCES
OF
PSYCHICS
WHO
CAN
SEE
THE
LEGS
OF
AMPUTEES
AS
IF
THEY
WERE
STILL
THERE
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
ABOUT
THE
KIRLIAN
PHANTOMS
THOUGH
IS
THAT
THE
ELECTROMAGNETIC
PATTERN
CANT
POSSIBLY
REPRESENT
A
SECONDARY
PHENOMENON
OR
THE
FIELD
WOULD
VANISH
WHEN
THE
PIECE
OF
LEAF
OR

VANISHED
THE
ENERGY
GRID
CONTAINED
IN
A

OBJECT
MUST
THEREFORE
BE

MORE
SIGNIFICANT

THE
