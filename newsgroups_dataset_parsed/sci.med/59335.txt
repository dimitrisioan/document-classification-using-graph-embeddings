WRITES
WHEN
I
WAS
A
SCHOOL
BOY
MY
BIOLOGY
TEACHER
TOLD
US
OF
AN
INCIDENT
IN
WHICH
A
COUPLE
WERE
VERY
PASSIONATE
WITHOUT
ACTUALLY
HAVING
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
SOMEHOW
THE
GIRL
BECAME
PREGNENT
AS
SPERM
CELLS
MADE
THEIR
WAY
TO
HER
THROUGH
THE
CLOTHES
VIA
PERSPERATION
WAS
MY
BIOLOGY
TEACHER
MISINFORMING
US
OR
DO
SUCH
INCIDENTS
ACTUALLY
OCCUR
SPERM
DEPOSITED
NEAR
THE
ENTRANCE
OF
THE
VAGINA
HAS
BEEN
KNOWN
TO
CAUSE
PREGNANCY
EVEN
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
HYMEN
I
DOUBT
THAT
SPERM
COULD
MAKE
IT
THROUGH
A
LAYER
OF
CLOTH
THEN
FIND
THE
RIGHT
PATH
TO
A
WAITING
OVUM
BUT
IT
MIGHT
BE
POSSIBLE
SO
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
WOMAN
TO
BE
BOTH
VIRGIN
AND
PREGNANT
ALSO
SOME
HYMENS
ARE
SUFFICIENTLY
LOOSE
TO
ALLOW
NEARNORMAL
INTERCOURSE
WITHOUT
RUPTURING
THE
PROBLEM
WHEN
INVESTIGATING
THESE
PHENOMENAE
IS
OF
COURSE
GETTING
AN
HONEST
ACCOUNT
OF
WHAT
EXACTLY
HAPPENED
