WRITES
CAN
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
ENLIGHTEN
ME
ON
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
LUNG
DISORDERS
AND
CLUBBING
OR
SWELLING
AND
WIDENING
OF
THE
FINGERTIPS
WHAT
IS
THE
MECHANISM
AND
WHY
WOULD
A
PHYSICIAN
CALL
FOR
CHEST
XRAYS
TO
DIAGNOSE
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
CLUBBING
PURISTS
OFTEN
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
TRUE
CLUBBING
AND
PSEUDO
CLUBBING
THE
DIFFERENCE
BEING
THAT
WITH
TRUE
CLUBBING
THE
ANGLE
OF
THE
NAIL
WHEN
VIEWED
FROM
THE
SIDE
IS
CONSTANTLY
NEGATIVE
WHEN
PROCEEDING
DISTALLY
TOWARDS
THE
FINGERTIP
WITH
PSEUDO
CLUBBING
THE
ANGLE
IS
INITIALLY
POSITIVE
THEN
NEGATIVE
WHICH
IS
THE
NORMAL
SITUATION
REAL
INTERNISTS
CAN
TALK
FOR
HOURS
ABOUT
CLUBBING
IM
LIMITED
TO
A
COUPLE
OF
MINUTES
WHETHER
THIS
DISTINCTION
HAS
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
REALITY
IS
ENTIRELY
UNCLEAR
BUT
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
THAT
INTERNISTS
LOVE
TO
PAW
OVER
DURING
ROUNDS
SUPPOSEDLY
ONLY
TRUE
CLUBBING
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
DISEASE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
LIST
OF
DISEASES
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CLUBBING
IS
QUITE
LONG
AND
INCLUDES
BOTH
CONGENITAL
CONDITIONS
AND
ACQUIRED
DISEASE
SINCE
MANY
OF
THESE
DISEASES
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CARDIOPULMONARY
PROBLEMS
LEADING
TO
RIGHT
TO
LEFT
SHUNTS
AND
CHRONIC
HYPOXEMIA
IT
IS
VERY
REASONABLE
TO
GET
A
CHEST
XRAY
HOWEVER
MANY
OF
THE
CONGENITAL
ABNORMALITIES
WOULD
ONLY
BE
DIAGNOSED
WITH
A
CARDIAC
CATHETERIZATION
THE
CAUSE
OF
CLUBBING
IS
UNCLEAR
BUT
PRESUMABLY
RELATES
TO
SOME
FACTOR
CAUSING
BLOOD
VESSELS
IN
THE
DISTAL
FINGERTIP
TO
DILATE
ABNORMALLY
CLUBBING
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
FROM
AN
EXAMINATION
WHICH
IS
A
TIPOFF
TO
DO
MORE
EXTENSIVE
EXAMINATION
OFTEN
HOWEVER
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
CLUBBING
IS
QUITE
APPARENT
KM
