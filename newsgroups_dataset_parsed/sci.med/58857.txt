genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
but
why
do
you
characterize
this
as
a
flight
of
fancy
or
a
fantasy
the
fantasy
was
that
he
had
found
something
of
fundamental
importance
to
one
of
the
hot
questions
of
the
day
he
really
had
very
little
reason
to
believe
it
other
than
raw
hope
by
fantasy
i
certainly
dont
mean
velikovskian
manias
some
other
theory
or
domain
i
would
offer
some
rather
well
known
examples
such
as
toricellis
puy
de
dome
experiment
done
for
the
sake
of
his
sea
of
air
hypothesis
im
not
familiar
with
the
history
of
this
experiment
although
arguably
i
should
be
surprising
well
given
the
prior
explanations
of
the
phenomena
involved
it
certainly
be
counted
as
so
was
the
theory
constructed
and
the
experiment
designed
out
of
perfectly
rational
grounds
well
there
was
a
pretty
successful
and
well
know
theory
of
fluids
the
analogy
to
fluids
by
toricelli
is
explicit
the
novelty
was
in
thinking
of
air
as
a
fluid
but
this
was
quite
a
novelty
at
the
time
was
the
theory
interesting
yes
was
it
new
well
one
could
argue
that
it
was
merely
the
extension
of
an
existing
theory
to
a
new
domain
but
i
think
this
begs
certain
questions
we
can
debate
that
if
you
like
i
think
that
it
is
enough
if
his
contemporaries
found
the
result
surprising
thats
not
what
id
quibble
about
what
id
like
to
know
are
toricellis
reasons
for
doing
his
experiment
not
the
post
hoc
constructed
reasons
but
the
thoughts
in
his
head
as
he
considered
the
problem
it
may
be
impossible
to
know
much
about
toricellis
thoughts
thats
too
bad
if
it
is
so
one
of
rootbernsteins
services
to
science
is
that
he
has
gone
rooting
about
in
pasteurs
and
flemings
and
other
peoples
notes
and
has
discovered
some
surprising
clues
about
their
motivations
pasteur
never
publicly
admitted
his
plan
to
create
mirrorimage
life
but
the
dreams
are
right
there
in
his
notebooks
finally
public
after
many
years
ready
for
anyone
to
read
and
i
and
my
friends
often
have
the
most
ridiculous
reasons
for
pursuing
results
one
of
my
best
came
because
i
was
mad
at
a
colleague
for
a
poorlywritten
claim
i
disproved
the
claim
of
course
toricellis
case
may
be
an
example
of
a
rarety
where
the
fantasy
not
only
motivates
the
experiment
but
turns
out
to
be
right
in
the
end
