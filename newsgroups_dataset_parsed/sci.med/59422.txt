med
school
admission
continued
hi
all
i
got
several
emails
and
a
couple
news
replies
and
i
guess
i
shoulda
went
into
more
detail
being
my
anxiety
level
is
peaking
and
you
folks
have
no
clue
who
i
am
i
may
as
well
post
the
specifics
and
see
what
you
people
think
regarding
my
previous
post
to
recap
i
applied
to
schools
total
of
which
were
md
and
do
as
it
stands
now
i
have
had
rejects
interviews
md
and
do
the
results
of
which
are
waiting
lists
md
and
one
do
schools
i
heard
nothing
from
at
all
i
have
contacted
all
institutions
other
than
the
rejects
and
they
have
no
info
whatsoever
to
tell
me
i
have
taken
a
good
mix
to
apply
to
top
schools
a
bunch
of
middles
and
a
few
safety
funny
that
most
of
my
safety
schools
were
the
first
to
reject
me
my
index
is
at
like
a
mcats
were
wq
and
wr
i
couldnt
get
the
damn
reading
score
up
i
never
stuff
like
art
history
politics
etc
ive
done
medical
research
at
the
undergrad
level
done
clinical
lab
work
for
years
now
but
unfortunately
i
have
no
patient
contact
experience
i
cant
think
of
what
else
i
left
out
but
thats
the
summary
what
percent
of
people
are
usually
called
from
the
waiting
lists
on
an
average
i
felt
that
my
interviews
went
quite
well
yet
i
dont
have
a
firm
acceptance
in
my
hand
anyone
have
any
suggestions
as
to
calm
the
mailbox
anxiety
if
you
premeds
out
there
or
med
students
have
any
questions
or
comments
for
me
feel
free
to
send
them
down
typing
is
a
form
of
antianxiety
