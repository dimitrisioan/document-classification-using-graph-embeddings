I
WROTE
OR
TO
USE
A
PHRASING
THAT
I
THINK
IS
MORE
ACCURATE
SCIENCE
IS
THE
INVESTIGATION
OF

AVOIDS

I
CAN
AGREE
WITH
THIS
IF
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
LESS
FUNDAMENTAL
ASPECTS
OF
SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
IN
FACT
I
DONT
SEE
THE
ALTERNATIVE
AS
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THE
FUNDAMENTALS
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
IN
SAYING
THIS
I
AM
AGREEING
WITH
THE
WORK
OF
PEOPLE
LIKE
KUHN
FEYERABEND
AND
LAKATOS
WHILE
METHODOLOGY
CANNOT
BE
SUBJECT
TO
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
INVESTIGATION
AS
THAT
TO
WHICH
IT
IS
APPLIED
IT
CAN
BE
CRITICALLY
APPRAISED
METHODOLOGIES
CAN
BE
COMPARED
TO
EACH
OTHER
SOMETIMES
BY
THE
CONFLICTING
RESULTS
THEY
PRODUCE
THIS
KIND
OF
CRITICAL
APPRAISAL
AND
COMPARISON
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
INAPPROPRIATENESS
OF
EXISTING
METHODOLOGIES
FOR
NEW
FIELDS
OF
STUDY
IS
WHAT
DRIVES
THE
EVOLUTION
OF
METHODOLOGIES
AND
HOW
WE
THINK
ABOUT
THEM
AS
USUAL
YOU
ARE
MISSING
THE
WHOLE
POINT
RUSSELL
BECAUSE
YOU
ARE
NOT
WILLING
TO
EVEN
CONSIDER
QUESTIONNING
YOUR
BASIC
ARTICLE
OF
FAITH
WHICH
IS
THAT
SCIENCE
IS
MERELY
A
MATTER
OF
METHODOLOGY
AND
THAT
THE
HIGHEST
PURPOSE
OF
SCIENCE
IS
TO
AVOID
MAKING
MISTAKES
THIS
IS
LIKE
SAYING
THAT
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
ASPECT
OF
BUSINESS
MANAGEMENT
IS
ACCURATE
BOOKKEEPING
IF
SCIENCE
WERE
NO
MORE
THAN
METHODOLOGY
AND
NOT
MAKING
MISTAKES
IT
WOULD
BE
A
POOR
THING
INDEED
WHAT
WAS
THE
METHODOLOGY
OF
DARWIN
WHAT
WAS

WAS

NONE
OF
THE
FOREGOING
SHOULD
BE
READ
AS
MEANING
THAT
WE
SHOULD
OPEN
THE
DOOR
TO
PRACTITIONERS
OF
QUACKERY
AND
PSUEDOSCIENCE
MODERN
ADVOCATES
OF
HOMEOPATHY
CHIROPRACTY
AND
TRADITIONAL
CHINESE
MEDICINE
RECEIVE
LITTLE
RESPECT
BECAUSE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THEY
USE
METHODS
AND
REASONING
THAT
THE
KIND
OF
RESEARCH
LEE
LADY
RECOMMENDS
HAS
SHOWN
TO
BE
TERRIBLY
FAULTY
THIS
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THAT
ALL
THEIR
TREATMENTS
ARE
INEFFECTIVE
IT
DOES
IMPLY
THAT
THOSE
WHO
RELY
ON
FAULTY
METHODOLOGY
AND
REASONING
ARE
INCAPABLE
OF
DISCOVERING
WHICH
TREATMENTS
ARE
EFFECTIVE
AND
WHICH
ARE
NOT
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
ARGUING
AGAINST
A
STRAW
MAN
BECAUSE
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
ANYONE
HERE
IS
ARGUING
THAT
QUACKERY
PSEUDOSCIENCE
HOMEOPATHY
CHIROPRACTY
AND
TRADITIONAL
CHINESE

SHOULD
BE
ACCEPTED
AS
SCIENCE
I
IN

THINK
THE
BASIC
IDEAS
OF
HOMEOPATHY
AND
CHIROPRACTY
SEEM
EXTREMELY
FLAKY
WHAT
SOME
OF
US
DO
BELIEVE
HOWEVER
IS
THAT
SOME
OF
THESE
THINGS
INCLUDING
SOME
OF
THE
FLAKY
IDEAS
ARE
DESERVING
OF
SERIOUS
SCIENTIFIC
ATTENTION
IF
IN
FACT
IT
WERE
TRUE
AS
YOU
HAVE
STATED
ABOVE
THAT
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
USE
THE
CURRENTLY
FASHIONABLE
METHODOLOGY
CAN
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHAT
IS
EFFECTIVE
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
THEN
SCIENCE
TODAY
WOULD
NOT
EXIST
FOR
ALL
OF
CURRENT
SCIENCE
IS
BASED
ON
THE
PAST
WORK
OF
SCIENTISTS
WHOSE
METHODOLOGY
BY
CURRENT
STANDARDS
WAS
SERIOUSLY
FLAWED
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
TRUE
THAT
AS
METHODOLOGY
IMPROVES
WE
NEED
TO
REEXAMINE
THOSE
RESULTS
DERIVED
IN
THE
PAST
USING
LESS
PERFECT
METHODOLOGIES
IT
IS
ALSO
TRUE
THAT
THE
RESULTS
OBTAINED
BY
PEOPLE
TODAY
WHO
STILL
RELY
ON
THOSE
EARLY
METHODOLOGIES
NEEDS
TO
BE
REEXAMINED
IN
A
MORE
RIGOROUS
FASHION
BY
THOSE
QUALIFIED
TO
DO
SO
CREDIBLY
BUT
TO
SAY
THAT
NOBODY
WHO
FAILS
TO
DO
ELABORATE
DOUBLEBLIND
STUDIES
IS
CAPABLE
OF
KNOWING
THEIR
ASS
FROM
A
HOLE
IN
THE
GROUND
AND
TO
SAY
THAT
NO
IDEAS
THAT
COME
FROM
OUTSIDE
THE
SCIENTIFIC
ESTABLISHMENT
COULD
POSSIBLY
BE
WORTHY
OF
SERIOUS
INVESTIGATION
THIS
TRULY
