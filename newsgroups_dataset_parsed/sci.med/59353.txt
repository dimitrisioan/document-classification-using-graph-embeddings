GOALS
THAT

INTO
MEDICINE
YOUR
ACADEMIC
AND
EXTRACURRICULAR
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
MAKE
A
DECISION
ABOUT
WHETHER
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TO
BE
A
MEDICAL
DOCTOR
I
HAD
CLASSMATES
WHO
DROPPED
OUT
IN
THE
FIRST
SEMESTER
OF
MED
SCHOOL
BECAUSE
THEY
FOUND
IT
WAS
NOT
WHAT
THEY
WANTED
TO
DO
I
HAVE
FRIENDS
WHO
APPLIED
FOUR
YEARS
IN
A
ROW
BEFORE
THEY
WERE
ACCEPTED
MEDICINE
AS
A
CAREER
IS
A
CHOICE
YOU
MUST
MAKE
FOR
YOURSELF
DONT
BE
PUSHED
INTO
IT
BECAUSE
OF
YOUR
PARENTSFAMILYSIGNIFICANT
OTHER
IF
YOU
STILL
WANT
TO
BE
A
MEDICAL
DOCTOR
DETERMINE
HOW
YOU
CAN
IMPROVE
YOUR
APPLICATION
A
LETTER
OF
RECOMMENDATION
FROM
A
PROFESSOR
WHO
KNOWS
YOU
WELL
AND
CAN
GIVE
AN
HONEST
POSITIVE
RECOMMENDATION
IS
FAR
BETTER
THAN
ONE
FROM
A
BIGSHOT
FAMOUS
PROFESSOR
WHO
ONLY
VAGUELY
REMEMBERS
YOUR
FACE
ALSO
DONT
BE
AFRAID
TO
ASK
THESE
PEOPLE
IF
THEY
CAN
GIVE
YOU
AN
HONEST
AND
POSITIVE
RECOMMENDATION
GIVE
THEM
A
CHANCE
TO
SAY
NO
SORRY
INSTEAD
OF
THE
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
SAYING
NO
SORRY
I
HAVE
TURNED
DOWN
WRITING
RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
SOME
STUDENTS
BECAUSE
I
DID
NOT
KNOW
THEM
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
ANY
MEANINGFUL
COMMENTS
AND
SOME
BECAUSE
I
HONESTLY
COULD
NOT
RECOMMEND
THEM
AT
THAT
POINT
REWRITE
YOUR
PERSONAL
STATEMENT
TAKE
IT
BY
AN
ENGLISH
PROFESSOR
OR
SOME
OTHER
FRIENDLY
PERSON
WITH
SKILL
AND
EXPERIENCE
IN
WRITING
AND
PROOFREADING
AND
GET
THEIR
CRITICISM
BOTH
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
AS
WELL
AS
HOW
YOU
SAY
IT
REVIEW
YOUR
ACADEMIC
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
IF
YOUR
GRADES
ARE
POOR
IN
SOME
AREA
DONT
BE
AFRAID
TO
SPEND
SOME
TIME
IN
FURTHER
COURSEWORK
EVIDENCE
OF
DETERMINED
COMMITTMENT
WILL
HELP
HERE
IF
YOU
FILLED
YOUR
PREMEDICINE
CURRICULUM
WITH
GUT
COURSES
IT
USUALLY
SHOWS
LOOK
AT
YOUR
EXTRACURRICULAR
INVOLVEMENTS
PARTICIPATING
IN
LOCAL
PHILANTHROPIC
OR
SERVICE
ORGANIZATIONS
IS
A
PLUS
SUBSTANTIAL
LEADERSHIP
ROLES
IN
AN
ORGANIZATION
HELP
ALSO
BEWARE
OF
RESUME
PADDING
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
NOT
DIFFICULT
TO
SPOT
AND
WEED
OUT
OVERALL
A
CLEAR
CONCEPTION
OF
WHERE
YOU
WISH
TO
HEAD
AND
WHY
YOU
WANT
TO
GET
THERE
COMBINED
WITH
AN
HONEST
SELFAPPRAISAL
OF
SKILLS
AND
APTITUDE
WILL
BE
THE
BEST
PATH
TO
TAKE
IN
APPLYING
TO
ANY
PROGRAM
MEDICAL
OR
WHATHAVEYOU
GOOD
LUCK
WITH
THE
PROCESS
AS
