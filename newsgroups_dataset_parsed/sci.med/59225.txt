POSTER
FOR
BEING
TREATED
BY
A
LISCENCED
PHYSICIAN
FOR
A
DISEASE
THAT
DID
NOT
EXIST
CALLING
THIS
PHYSICIAN
A
QUACK
WAS
REPREHENSIBLE
STEVE
AND
I
SEE
THAT
YOU
AND
SOME
OF
THE
OTHERS
ARE
DOING
IT
HERE
AS
WELL
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
ANY
QUACKS
EXIST
HOW
ABOUT
QUACK
DIAGNOSES
IS
BEING
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
ENOUGH
TO
GUARANTEE
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
NOT
A
QUACK
OR
IS
IT
JUST
THAT
EVEN
IF
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
IS
A
QUACK
OTHER
PEOPLE
SHOULDNT
SAY
SO
CAN
YOU
GIVE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
COMMONLY
DIAGNOSED
AILMENT
THAT
YOU
THINK
IS
A
QUACK
DIAGNOSIS
OR
HAVE
WE
GOTTEN
TO
THE
POINT
IN
CIVILIZATION
WHERE
WE
NO
LONGER
NEED
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
UNSCRUPULOUS
HEALERS
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
PEOPLE
DAVID
RIND
I
DONT
LIKE
THE
TERM
QUACK
BEING
APPLIED
TO
A
LICENSED
PHYSICIAN
DAVID
QUESTIONABLE
CONDUCT
IS
MORE
APPROPRIATELY
CALLED
UNETHICALIN
MY
OPINION
ILL
GIVE
YOU
SOME
EXAMPLES
PRESCRIBING
CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES
TO
PATIENTS
WITH
NO
DEMONSTRATED
NEEDOTHER
THAN
A
DRUG
ADDITION
FOR
THE
MEDICATION
PRESCRIBING
THYROID
PREPS
FOR
PATIENTS
WITH
NORMAL

FUNCTION
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
QUICK
WEIGHT
LOSS
USING
LAETRIL
TO
TREAT
CANCER
PATIENTS
WHEN
SUCH
TREATMENT
HAS
BEEN
SHOWN
TO
BE
INEFFECTIVE
AND
DANGEROUSCYANIDE
RELEASE
BY
THE
NCI
THESE
ARE
ERRORS
OF
COMMISSION
THAT
COMPETENTLY
TRAINED
PHYSICIANS
SHOULD
NOT
COMMITT
BUT
SOMETIMES
DO
THERE
ARE
ALSO
ERRORS
OF
OMISSIONSOME
OF
WHICH
RESULT
IN
MALPRACTICE
SUITS
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
USING
ANTIFUNGAL
AGENTS
TO
TRY
TO
RELIEVE
DISCOMFORT
IN
A
PATIENT
WHO
YOU
SUSPECT
MAY
BE
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WITH
CANDIDAOR
ANOTHER
FUNGAL
GROWTH
IS
AN
ERROR
OF
COMMISSION
OR
OMISSION
HEALERS
HAVE
HAD
A
LONG
HISTORY
OF
TRYING
TO
RELIEVE
HUMAN
SUFFERING
SOME
HAVE
STUCK
TO
STANDARD
APPROVED
PROCEDURES
OTHERS
HAVE
BEEN
WILLING
TO
TRY
ANY
REASONABLE
TREATMENT
IF
THERE
IS
A
CHANCE
THAT
IT
WILL
HELP
THE
PATIENT
THE
KEY
HAS
TO
BE
TIED
TO
THE
HEALERS
OATH
I
WILL
DO
NO
HARM
BUT
YOU
KNOW
DAVID
THAT
VERY
FEW
TREATMENTS
INVOLVE
NO
RISK
TO
THE
PATIENT
THE
JOB
OF
THE
PHYSICIAN
IS
A
VERY
DIFFICULT
ONE
WHEN
RISK
VERSUS
BENEFIT
HAS
TO
BE
WEIGHED
EACH
PHYSICIAN
DEALS
WITH
THIS
RISKBENEFIT
PARADOX
A
LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY
SOME
ARE
VERY
CONSERVATIVE
WHILE
OTHERS
ARE
MORE
AGRESSIVE
AN
AGRESSIVE
APPROACH
MAY
BE
MORE
COSTLY
TO
THE
PATIENT
AND
CARRY
MORE
RISK
BUT
AS
LONG
AS
THE
MOTIVE
IS
IMPROVING
THE
PATIENTS
HEALTH
AND
NOT
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
RAKE
IN
LOTS
OF
MONEYTHROUGH
SOME
OF
THE
SCHEMES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
UNCOVERED
IN
THE
MEDICARE
FRAUD
CASES
I
DONT
SEE
THE
NEED
TO
LABEL
THESE
HEALERS
AS
QUACKS
OR
EVEN
UNETHICAL
WHAT
DO
I
RESERVE
THE
TERM
QUACK
FOR
PSEUDOMEDICAL
PROFESSIONALS
THESE
PEOPLE
LURK
ON
THE
FRINGES
OF
THE
HEALTH
CARE
SYSTEM
WAITING
FOR
THE
FRUSTRATED
PATIENT
TO
FALL
INTO
THEIR
LAIR
SOME
OF
THESE
INDIVIDUALS
ARE
REALLY
DOING
A
PRETTY
GOOD
JOB
OF
PROVIDING
ALTERNATIVE
MEDICINE
BUT
MANY
LACK
ANY
FORMAL
TRAINING
AND
ARE
IN
THE
BUSINESS
SIMPLY
TO
MAKE
A
FEW
FAST
BUCKS
WHILE
A
PATIENT
CAN
BE
REASONABLY
ASSURED
OF
GETTING
COMPETENT
CARE
WHEN
A
LISCENCED
PHYSICIAN
IS
CONSULTED
THIS
ALTERNATIVE
CARE
AREA
IS
REALLY
A
BUYERS
BEWARE
ARENA
IF
YOU
ARE
LUCKY
YOU
MAY
FIND
SOMEONE
WHO
CAN
HELP
YOU
IF
YOU
ARE
UNLUCKY
YOU
CAN
LOOSE
A
LOT
OF
MONEY
AND
DEVELOP
SEVERE
DISEASE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
INABILITY
OF
THESE
PSEUDO
MEDICAL
PROFESSIONAL
TO
DIAGNOSE
DISEASEWHICH
IS
THE
FORTAY
OF
THE
LISCENED
PHYSICIANS
I
HOPE
THAT
THIS
CLEARS
THINGS
UP
