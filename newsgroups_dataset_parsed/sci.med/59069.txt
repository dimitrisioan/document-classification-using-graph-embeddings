NORING
WRITES
THERE
IS
NO
CONVINCING
EVIDENCE
THAT
SUCH
A
DISEASE
EXISTS
THERES
A
LOT
OF
EVIDENCE
IT
JUST
HASNT
BEEN
ADEQUATELY
GATHERED
AND
PUBLISHED
IN
A
WAY
THAT
WILL
CONVINCE
THE
DIEHARD
MELANCHOLIC
SKEPTICS
WHO
QUIVER
EVERYTIME
THE
WORD
ANECDOTE
OR
EMPIRICAL
IS
USED
SNORT
AH
THERE
GO
MY
SINUSES
AGAIN
FOR
EXAMPLE
DR
IVKER
WHO
WROTE
THE
BOOK
SINUS
SURVIVAL
ALWAYS
GIVES
OH
WOW
A
CLASSIC
TEXTBOOK
HEY
THEY
LAUGHED
AT
EINSTEIN
TOO
BEFORE
ANY
OTHER
TREATMENT
A
SYSTEMIC
ANTIFUNGAL
SUCH
AS
NIZORAL
TO
HIS
NEW
PATIENTS
IF
THEYVE
BEEN
ON
BRAODSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTICS
OR
MORE
TIMES
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
YEARS
HES
KEPT
A
RECORD
OF
THE
RESULTS
AND
FOR
OVER
PATIENTS
FOUND
THAT
OVER
OF
HIS
PATIENTS
GET
SIGNIFICANT
RELIEF
OF
ALLERGICSINUS
SYMPTOMS
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
ONLY
THE
BEGINNING
FOR
HIS
PROGRAM
YEAH
ILL
BET
TOMORROW
THE
WORLD
LISTEN
UNCONTROLLED
STUDIES
LIKE
THIS
ARE
WORTHLESS
IN
MY
CASE
AS
I
REPORTED
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
I
WAS
DEVELOPING
THE
CLASSIC
SYMPTOMS
OUTLINED
IN
THE
YEAST
CONNECTION
I
AGREE
IT
IS
A
POORLY
WRITTEN
BOOK
EG
EXTREME
SENSITIVITY
TO
PLASTICS
VAPORS
ETC
WHICH
I
NEVER
HAD
BEFORE
STARTED
IN
NOVEMBER
WITHIN
ONE
WEEK
OF
FULL
DOSAGE
OF
SPORANOX
THE
SENSITIVITY
TO
CHEMICALS
HAS
FULLY
DISAPPEARED
I
CAN
NOW
SIT
ON
MY
COUCH
AT
HOME
WITHOUT
DYING
AFTER
TWO
MINUTES
IM
ALSO
GREATLY
IMPROVED
IN
OTHER
AREAS
AS
WELL
IM
SURE
YOU
ARE
YOU
SOUND
LIKE
THE
TYPICAL
HYSTERICHYPOCHONDRIAC
WHO
RESPONDS
TO
MIRACLE
CURES
OF
COURSE
I
HAVE
ALLERGY
SYMPTOMS
ETC
I
AM
ESPECIALLY
ALLERGIC
TO
MOLDS
YEASTS
ETC
IT
DOESNT
TAKE
A
ROCKET
SCIENTIST
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THAT
IF
ONE
HAS
EXCESSIVE
COLONIZATION
OF
YEAST
IN
THE
BODY
AND
YOU
HAVE
A
NATURAL
ALLERGY
TO
YEASTS
THAT
A
THRESHOLD
WOULD
BE
REACHED
WHERE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
PERCEPTIBLE
SYMPTOMS
YEAH
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
ME
SO
OF
COURSE
IT
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
SNORT
ALSO
YEAST
DO
PRODUCE
TOXINS
OF
VARIOUS
SORTS
AND
AGAIN
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
BE
A
ROCKET
SCIENTIST
TO
REALIZE
THAT
SUCH
TOXINS
CAN
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
IN
SOME
PEOPLE
YEAH
IT
SOUNDS
REASONABLE
TO
ME
OF
COURSE
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
A
PERSON
WHO
IS
IMMUNE
COMPROMISED
AS
TESTS
SHOWED
I
WAS
FROM
OVER
YEARS
OF
ANTIBIOTICS
NUTRITIONALLYDEFICIENCIES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
STRESS
OF
INFECTIONS
AND
ALLERGIES
ETC
OH
REALLY
WHAT
TESTS
IMMUNECOMPROMISED
MY
ASS
MORE
LIKE
CREDULOUS
MALINGERER
THIS
IS
A
PSYCHIATRIC
SYNDROME
CAN
DEVELOP
EXCESSIVE
YEAST
COLONIZATION
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
BODY
IT
IS
A
TOUGH
QUESTION
TO
ANSWER
SINCE
TESTING
FOR
EXCESSIVE
YEAST
COLONIZATION
IS
NOT
EASY
ONE
ALMOST
HAS
TO
TAKE
AN
EMPIRICAL
APPROACH
TO
DIAGNOSIS
FORTUNATELY
SPORANOX
IS
RELATIVELY
SAFE
UNLIKE
PAST
ANTIFUNGALS
STILL
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFUL
HOWEVER
SO
THERES
NO
REASON
ANY
LONGER
TO
WITHHOLD
SPORANOX
TREATMENT
FOR
EMPIRICAL
REASONS
YOU
KNOW
ITS
A
SHAME
THAT
A
DRUG
LIKE
ITRACONAZOLE
IS
BEING
MISUSED
IN
THIS
WAY
ITS
RIDICULOUSLY
EXPENSIVE
AND
POTENTIALLY
TOXIC
THE
TROUBLE
IS
THAT
IT
ISNT
TOXIC
ENOUGH
SO
IT
GETS
ABUSED
BY
QUACKS
BTW
SOME
WOULD
SAY
TO
TRY
NYSTATIN
UNFORTUNATELY
MOST
YEAST
GROWS
HYPHAE
TOO
DEEP
INTO
TISSUE
FOR
NYSTATIN
TO
HAVE
ANY
PERMANENT
AFFECT
YOULL
FIND
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
ON
NYSTATIN
ALL
THE
TIME
THE
ONLY
GOOD
THING
ABOUT
NYSTATIN
IS
THAT
ITS
RELATIVELY
CHEAP
AND
WHEN
TAKEN
ORALLY
NONTOXIC
BUT
ORAL
NYSTATIN
IS
WITHOUT
ANY
SYSTEMIC
EFFECT
SO
UNLESS
IT
WERE
GIVEN
IV
IT
WOULD
BE
WITHOUT
ANY
EFFECT
ON
YOUR
SINUSES
I
WISH
THESE
QUACKS
WOULD
FIRST
USE
IV
NYSTATIN
OR
AMPHOTERICIN
B
ON
PEOPLE
LIKE
YOU
THAT
WOULD
SOLVE
THE
YEAST
PROBLEM
ONCE
AND
FOR
ALL
IN
SUMMARY
I
APPRECIATE
ALL
OF
THE
ATTEMPTS
BY
THOSE
WHO
DESIRE
TO
KEEP
MEDICINE
ON
THE
RIGHT
ROAD
BUT
METHINKS
THAT
SOME
WHO
HOLD
TOO
FIRMLY
TO
THE
PARTY
LINE
ARE
ACADEMICS
WHO
HAVENT
BEEN
IN
THE
TRENCHES
LONG
ENOUGH
ACTUALLY
TREATING
PATIENTS
IF
ANYBODY
DOCTORS
INCLUDED
SAID
TO
ME
TO
MY
FACE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
YEAST
CONNECTION
I
CANNOT
GUARANTEE
THEIR
SAFETY
FOR
THEIR
INCOMPETENCE
RIPPING
OFF
THEIR
LIPS
IS
JUSTIFIED
AS
FAR
AS
I
AM
CONCERNED
PERHAPS
A
LITTLE
HALDOL
WOULD
GO
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARDS
AMELIORATING
YOUR
SYMPTOMS
ARE
YOU
PAYING
