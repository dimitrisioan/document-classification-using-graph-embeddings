RE
HOMEOPATHY
A
RESPECTABLE
MEDICAL
TRADITION
IN
ARTICLE
GEBCSPITTEDU
GORDON
BANKS
WRITES
ACCEPTED
BY
WHOM
NOT
BY
SCIENTISTS
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
IN
EVERY
COUNTRY
WHO
WASTE
TIME
AND
MONEY
ON
QUACKERY
IN
BRITAIN
AND
SCANDANAVIA
WHERE
I
HAVE
WORKED
IT
WAS
NOT
PAID
FOR
WHAT
ARE
MOST
OF
THESE
COUNTRIES
I
DONT
BELIEVE
YOU
I
AM
TOLD
BY
THE
PERSON
WHO
I
CARE
A
LOT
ABOUT
AND
WHO
I
AM
WORRIED
IS
GOING
TO
START
PUTTING
HIS
HEALTH
AND
MONEY
INTO
HOMEOPATHY
WITHOUT
REALLY
KNOWING
WHAT
HE
IS
GETTING
INTO
AND
WHO
IS
THE
REASON
I
POSTED
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
ABOUT
HOMEOPATHY
THAT
IN
BRITAIN
HOMEOPATHY
IS
AVAILABLE
ON
THE
NATIONAL
HEALTH
SERVICE
AND
THAT
THERE
ARE
ABOUT
GPS
WHO
USE
HOMEOPATHIC
PRACTICES
TRUE
FALSE
WHAT
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
ANY
IMPORTANT
AND
DOCUMENTED
INVESTIGATIONS
INTO
HOMEOPATHIC
PRINCIPLES
I
WAS
READING
A
BOOK
ON
HOMEOPATHY
OVER
THE
WEEKEND
I
TURNED
TO
THE
SECTION
ON
THE
PRINCIPLES
BEHIND
HOMEOPATHIC
MEDICINE
AND
TWO
PARAGRAPHS
INFORMED
ME
THAT
HOMEOPATHS
DONT
FEEL
OBLIGED
TO
PROVIDE
ANY
SORT
OF
EXPLANATION
THE
AUTHOR
STATED
THIS
WITH
PRIDE
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
SOME
SORT
OF
VIRTUE
WHY
AM
I
SCEPTICAL
ABOUT
HOMEOPATHY
IS
IT
BECAUSE
I
AM
A
NARROWMINDED
BIGOT
OR
IS
IT
BECAUSE
HOMEOPATHY
REALLY
LOOKS
MORE
LIKE
WITCHDOCTORY
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
