krillean
photography
involves
taking
pictures
of
minute
decapods
resident
in
the
seas
surrounding
the
antarctic
or
pictures
taken
by
them
perhaps
bill
from
oz
bill
no
flame
intended
but
youre
way
way
off
base
in
simple
terms
kirilian
photography
registers
the
electromagnetical
fields
around
objects
in
simple
it
takes
pictures
of
your
aura

greg
no
flame
intended
but
i
think
you
just
missed
one
of
the
rare
attempts
of
humor
in
sciskeptic
krillean
against
kirilian
get
it
btw
i
think
youre
a
bit
of
base
yourself
since
to
my
knowledge
the
electromagnetic
field
around
a
stone
is
rather
abscent
but
still
a
stone
has
a
nice
aura
on
the
kirilian
photographs
dont
remember
excactly
but
corona
discharge
i
think
is
a
more
fitting
expression
than
aura
think
youll
find
something
on
this
in
the
skepticfaq
