THE
REASON
IM
POSTING
THIS
ARTICLE
TO
THIS
NEWSGROUP
IS
TO
GATHER
ANY
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THIS
DISORDER
FROM
ANYONE
WHO
MIGHT
HAVE
RECENTLY
BEEN
EFFECTED
BY
IT
FROM
BEING
ASSOCIATED
WITH
IT
OR
ACTUALLY
HAVING
THIS
DISORDER
AND
HELP
ME
FIND
OUT
WHERE
I
CAN
ACCESS
ANY
MEDICAL
LITERATURE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
SEIZURES
OVER
THE
INTERNET
RECENTLY
I
HAD
A
BABY
BOY
BORN
WITH
SEIZURES
WHICH
OCCURED
HOURS
AFTER
BIRTH
HE
WAS
IMMEDIATELY
TRANSFERRED
TO
A
MAJOR
HOSPITAL
IN
BOSTON
AND
HAS
SINCE
BEEN
UNDERGOING
EXTENSIVE
DRUG
TREATMENT
FOR
HIS
CONDITION
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
MAJOR
LEARNING
EXPERIENCE
FOR
ME
AND
MY
WIFE
NOT
ONLY
IN
LEARNING
THE
MEDICAL
PROBLEMS
THAT
FACED
OUR
SON
BUT
ALSO
IN
DEALING
WITH
HOSPITALS
PROCEDURESETC
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GO
INTO
A
LOT
OF
DETAIL
BUT
HIS
CONDITION
WAS
TERMED
QUITE
SEVERE
AT
FIRST
THEN
SLOWLY
HE
BEGAN
TO
GROW
AND
PUT
ON
WEIGHT
AS
A
NORMAL
BABY
WOULD
HE
WAS
PUT
ON
THE
STANDARD
ANTICONVULSION
DRUGS
AND
THAT
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
HELP
OUT
HIS
MRI
EKG
CATSCANS
ARE
ALL
NORMAL
BUT
THE
EEGS
SHOW
ALOT
OF
SEIZURE
ACTIVITY
AFTER
MANY
METABOLIC
TESTS
BODY
STRUCTURE
TESTS
AND
INFECTIONVIRUS
TESTS
THE
DOCTORS
STILL
DO
NOT
KNOW
QUITE
WHAT
TYPE
OF
SIEZURES
HE
IS
HAVING
ALTHOUGH
THEY
DO
HAVE
ALOT
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
IT
IS
NOW
POINTING
TO
INFANTILE
SPASMS
THIS
IS
WHERE
WE
STAND
RIGHT
NOW
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
OF
ANY
DATABASE
OR
NEWSGROUP
OR
AS
I
MENTIONED
UP
ABOVE
ANY
INFORMATION
RELATING
TO
THIS
DISORDER
I
WOULD
SURE
APPRECIATE
HEARING
FROM
YOU
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
PLAY
DOCTOR
HERE
BUT
ONLY
TRYING
TO
GATHER
INFORMATION
ABOUT
IT
AS
I
KNOW
NOW
THESE
PARTICULAR
TYPES
OF
DISORDERS
ARE
STILL
NOT
REALLY
WELL
UNDERSTOOD
BY
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
AND
SO
IM
GOING
TO
SEE
NOWIF
SOMEHOW
THE
INTERNET
CAN
AT
LEAST
GIVE
ME
ALITTLE
INSIGHT
THANKS
