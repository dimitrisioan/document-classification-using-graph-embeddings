A
FROM
SOME
OF
THE
REPLIES
TO
MY
ORIGINAL
POSTING
ITS
EVIDENT
THAT
SOME
A
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
SECRETE
ENOUGH
MUCOUS
TO
KEEP
THEIR
NOSE
LINING
PROTECTED
INCLUDE
SMALL
AMOUNTS
OF
HOT
SPICY
FOODS
WITH
YOUR
MEALS
ITS
NOT
A
CURE
BUT
MANY
PEOPLE
FIND
IT
HELPFUL
TO
CREATE
EXTRA
MUCUS
YOU
MAY
ALSO
CONSIDER
TAKING
A
FEW
DROPS
OF
IODINE
IN
JUICE
OR
WATER
CONSULT
YOUR
DOCTOR
FIRST
WHICH
IS
AVAILABLE
OTC
IN
CANADA
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
SEDENTARY
LIFESTYLE
EXERCISING
SOMETIMES
HELPS
A
FROM
ENVIRONMENTAL
INFLUENCES
IE
DRY
AIR
BUT
IVE
HAD
NO
RESPONSES
A
FROM
ANYONE
WITH
EXPERIENCE
WITH
RUTIN
IS
THERE
ANOTHER
NEWSGROUP

A
MIGHT

ROBERT
ALLISON
I
TRIED
TO
EMAIL
YOU
BUT
OUR
BOARD
IS
HAVING
INTERNET
PROBLEMS
SO
IM
NOT
SURE
WHETHER
YOU
GOT
THE
INFORMATION
ON
RUTIN
OR
NOT
RUTIN
IS
NOT
A
HERB
BUT
PART
OF
THE
BIOFLAVONOID
COMPLEX
YOU
SHOULD
GENERALLY
NOT
TAKE
RUTIN
BY
ITSELF
BUT
TAKE
THE
WHOLE
BIOFLAVONOID
COMPLEX
INSTEAD
IF
YOU
DONT
AND
THERE
ARE
SOME
EXCEPTIONS
TO
THAT
YOULL
EVENTUALLY
CREATE
A
HESPERIDIN
DEFICIENCY
WHICH
IS
THE
OTHER
MAJOR
COMPONENT
OF
THE
BIOFLAVONOID
COMPLEX
I
FOUND
OUT
THE
HARD
WAY
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
I
RECOMMENDED
RUTIN
AFTER
IT
SHOWED
DEFICIENT
IN
PATIENTS
WHO
WERE
NOT
DEFICIENT
IN
HESPERIDIN
BE
FORE
A
LATER
RETEST
ALMOST
ALWAYS
SHOWED
A
SUBSEQUENT
DEFICIENCY
IN
HESPERIDIN
WHICH
FROM
THEN
ON
MADE
ME
ALWAYS
ADD
BIOFLAVONOIDS
TO
ANYONE
THAT
HAD
VERY
LOW
LEVELS
OF
RUTIN
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
PEOPLE
ARE
EQUALLY
LOW
IN
RUTIN
AND
HESPERIDIN
SO
THERE
IS
REALLY
NO
REASON
TO
TAKE
RUTIN
BY
ITSELF
BUT
USE
THE
WHOLE
BIOFLAVONOID
COMPLEX
INSTEAD
I
HAVE
SEVERAL
THOUSAND
PATIENTS
TAKING
THEM
WITH
MANY
CLAIMING
THAT
THEY
HAD
BEEN
HELPED
WITH
HEMORRHOIDS
VARICOSE

CHRONIC

ANEURYSMS
GASTROINTESTINAL
BLEEDING

IN
DESPERATION
TOOK
A
WHOLE
BOTTLE
IN
ONE
DAY
FOR
HIS
PAINFUL
BLEEDING
HEMORRHOIDS
WITHOUT
ANY
ILL
EFFECTS
THEY
ARE
ALSO
NONTOXIC
IN
VERY
HIGH
AMOUNTS
THATS
WHY
THEY
CAN
BE
SAFELY
RECOMMENDED
IF
YOU
ARE
ALLERGIC
TO
CITRUS
FRUIT
THEY
ARE
MADE
FROM
THEIR

PINE

TESTED
SHOW
A
BIOFLAVONOID
DEFICIENCY
WITH
THE

DAILY
DOSAGE
NEEDED
BEING
ABOUT
FOR
MAJOR
COMPLAINTS
IS
COMMON
IN
CASE
THEY
CANNOT
BE
TAKEN
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
SIZE
AND
TASTE
THEY
ARE
BIG
AND
THEY
DONT
TASTE
THAT
GREAT
A
PRODUCT

FROM
PINE
BARK
EXTRACT
GIVES
YOU
THE

EFFECT
AND
THE
TABLETS
ARE
QUITE
SMALL
AND
TASTE
MUCH
BETTER
HOWEVER
THE
COST
IS
ABOUT
SEVEN
TIMES
HIGHER
FOR
THE
EQUIVALENT
EFFECT
ONE
TABLET
OF
THE

GIVES
YOU
ABOUT
THE

AS
OF
BIOFLAVONOIDS
THE
