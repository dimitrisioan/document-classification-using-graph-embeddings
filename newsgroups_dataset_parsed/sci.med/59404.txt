ABOUT

WHATEVER
SPELLING
PHOTOGRAPHY
I
COULDNT
HELP
BUT
BEING
SLIGHTLY
DISGUSTED
BY
THE
NARROWMINDED
I
KNOW
IT
ALL
I
DONT
BELIEVE
WHAT
I
CANT
SEE
OR
MEASURE
ATTITUDE
OF
MANY
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
WHERE
HAVE
YOU
SEEN
THAT
ATTITUDE
I
AM
NEITHER
A
REAL
BELIEVER
NOR
A
DISBELIEVER
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
SOCALLED
PARANORMAL
STUFF
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
IM
CONCERNED
IT
IS
JUST
AS
LIKELY
AS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
FOR
INSTANCE
A
GOD
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
QUITE
ACCEPTED
IN
OUR
SOCIETIES
WITHOUT
ANY
SCIENTIFIC
BASIS
I
AM
CONVINCED
THAT
IT
IS
A
SERIOUS
MISTAKE
TO
CLOSE
YOUR
MIND
TO
SOMETHING
ANYTHING
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IT
DOESNT
FIT
YOUR
CURRENT
FRAME
OF
REFERENCE
HISTORY
SHOWS
THAT
MANY
GREAT
PEOPLE
GREAT
SCIENTISTS
WERE
PEOPLE
WHO
KEPT
AN
OPEN
MIND
AND
WERE
RIDICULED
BY
SCEPTICS
FINE
JACKASS
SUPPOSE
YOU
POINT
OUT
EVEN
ONE
ASPECT
OF
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
THATS

DISCLAIMER
HEY
I
UNDERSTAND
VAXEN
AND
VMS
THATS
WHAT
I
GET
PAID
FOR
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
ASTRONOMY
IS
PURELY
AT
THE
AMATEUR
LEVEL
OR
BELOW
SO
UNLESS
WHAT
IM
SAYING
IS
DIRECTLY
RELATED
TO
VAXVMS
DONT
HOLD
ME
OR
MY
ORGANIZATION
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
IF
IT
IS
RELATED
TO
VAXVMS
YOU
CAN
TRY
TO
HOLD
ME
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
BUT
MY
ORGANIZATION
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
