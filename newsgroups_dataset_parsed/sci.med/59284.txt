BROAD
DIETARY
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
INDUSTRIALIZED
NATIONS
WE
THINK
HDLCHOLESTEROL
INCREASED
BECAUSE
WE
INCREASED
THE
AMOUNT
OF
DIETARY
FAT
OVER
THE
FAT
CONTENT
USED
IN
THE
PREVIOUS
TARAHUMARA
METABOLIC
STUDY
IN
THAT
STUDY
WE
SAW
NO
CHANGE
IN
HDL
LEVELS
AFTER
RAISING
THE
DIETARY
CHOLESTEROL
BUT
KEEPING
THE
FAT
RELATIVELY
CONSISTENT
WITH
NATIVE
CONSUMPTION
IN
THE
PRESENT
STUDY
WE
INCREASED
FAT
INTAKE
TO
PERCENT
OF
THE
TOTAL
CALORIES
WE
REACHED
THE
CONCLUSION
IN
THE
TARAHUMARA
STUDY
THAT
HDL
REFLECTS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
DIETARY
FAT
IN
GENERAL
AND
NOT
THE
AMOUNT
OF
DIETARY
CHOLESTEROL
HDL
MUST
INCREASE
TO
HELP
METABOLIZE
THE
FAT
AND
IT
INCREASED
QUITE
A
BIT
IN
THIS
STUDY
DR
CONNOR
EXPLAINS
LOW
HDL
IN
THE
TARAHUMARANS
IS
NOT
TYPICALLY
AN
IMPORTANT
PREDICTOR
OF
CORONARY
HEART
DISEASE
BECAUSE
THEY
DO
NOT
NORMALLY
CONSUME
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
FAT
OR
CHOLESTEROL
HDL
REMAINS
AN
IMPORTANT
PREDICTOR
TO
AMERICANS
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
USUAL
HIGH
FAT
INTAKE
DR
CONNOR
RECOMMENDS
A
DIET
FOR
AMERICANS
THAT
CONTAINS
LESS
THAN
PERCENT
OF
TOTAL
CALORIES
AS
FAT
LESS
THAN
MG
OF
CHOLESTEROL
AND
A
CSI
AROUND
VARYING
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH

NEEDS
SUCH
A

IS
LOW
IN

AND

FAT
HIGH

DR

ALSO
COMMENTS
ON
RECENT
SUGGESTIONS
THAT
AMERICANS
ADOPT
A
MEDITERRANEANSTYLE
DIET
THE
ORIGINAL
MEDITERRANEAN
DIET
IN
ITS
PRISTINE
STATE
CONSISTED
OF
A
VERY
LOW
INTAKE
OF
FAT
AND
VERY
FEW
ANIMAL
AND
DAIRY
PRODUCTS
WE
ARE
ALREADY
EATING
A
LOT
OF
MEAT
AND
DAIRY

SIMPLY
TO
CONTINUE
THAT
PATTERN
WHILE
SWITCHING
TO
OLIVE
OIL
IS
NOT
GOING
TO

THE
SITUATION
THE

HEALTH
ORGANIZATION
WHO
IS
FOCUSING
MUCH
ATTENTION
ON
THE
EMERGENCE
OF
DISEASES
SUCH
AS
CORONARY
HEART
DISEASE
IN
NATIONS
AND
SOCIETIES
UNDERGOING
TECHNOLOGICAL
DEVELOPMENT
DR
CONNOR
SAYS
THAT
CORONARY
HEART
DISEASE
STARTS
WITH
A
GIVEN
SOCIETYS
ELITE
WHO
TYPICALLY
EAT
A
DIFFERENT
DIET
THAN
THE
AVERAGE
CITIZEN
IF
THE
PATTERN
OF
AFLUENCE
INCREASES
THE
ENTIRE
POPULATION
WILL
HAVE
HAVE
A
HIGHER
INCIDENCE
OF

HEART
DISEASE
WHICH
PLACES
A
TERMENDOUS
HEALTH
CARE
BURDEN
ON
A
SOCIETY
WHO
WOULD
LIKE
THE

TO

HEART
DISEASE
SO
THEY

ON

MEASURES

WELLBEING
RATHER
THAN

FOR

EXPENSIVE
MEDICAL
TECHNOLOGY
DR
CONNORS
SAYS
THE
OVERALL
IMPLICATION
OF
THIS
STUDY
IS
THAT
HUMANS
CAN
READILY
MOVE
THEIR
PLASMA
LIPIDS
AND
LIPOPROTEIN
VALUES
INTO
A
HIGHRISK
RANGE
WITHIN

THE
