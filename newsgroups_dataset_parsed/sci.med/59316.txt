doctor
in
your
area
who
uses
sublingual
drops
instead
of
shots
for
treatment

are
given
a
small
bottle
of
antigens
drops
are
placed
under
the
tongue
for
minutes
my
this
homeopathic
remedies
i
tried
the
dander
one
for
a
month
drops
three
times
a
day
i
didnt
notice
any
change
whats
so
ever
how
long
were
you
using
the
drops
before
you
noticed
a
difference
for
me

treatment
is
more
expensive
because
