DISEASE
IS
A
GREAT
LEVELING
EXPERIENCE
HOWEVER
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
VERY
MUCH
AFRONTED
TO
FIND
OUT
THAT
ALL
THE
MONEY
IN
THE
WORLD
DOES
NOT
BUY
ONE
HEALTH
EVERYONE
LOOKS
THE
SAME
WHEN
THEY
DIE
IF
MONEY
DOES
NOT
BUY
ONE
HEALTH
WHY
ARE
WE
TALKING
ABOUT
PAYING
FOR
MEDICAL
EXPENSES
FOR
THOSE
NOT
CURRENTLY
ADEQUATELY
COVERED
HERMAN
I
WOULD
THINK
YOU
OF
ALL
PEOPLE
WOULDCOULD
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
HEALTH
AND
TREATMENT
OF
DISEASE
ALL
THE
PREVENTION
MEDICINE
PEOPLE
PREACH
THIS
ALL
THE
TIME
YOU
CANNOT
BUY
HEALTH
YOU
CAN
BUY
TREATMENT
OF
DISEASE
ASSUMING
YOU
ARE
LUCKY
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
A
DISEASE
WHICH
CAN
BE
TREATED
A
RICH
PERSON
WITH
A
TERMINAL
DISEASE
IS
A
BIT
OUT
OF
LUCK
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
ADEQUATELY
COVERED
AND
THERE
NEVER
WILL
BE
AND
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
ILL
BE
THE
FIRST
TO
ADMIT
THAT
ALL
MY
PATIENTS
DIE
