disease
is
a

experience

some
people
are
very
much
afronted
to
find
out
that
all

money
in

world
does

one
health
everyone
looks
the

when
they
die
if
money
does

why
are
we
talking
about
paying

i
would
think
you
of
all
people
wouldcould
distinguish
between
health
and
treatment
of
disease
all
the
prevention
medicine
people
preach
this
all
the
time
you
cannot
buy
health
you
can
buy
treatment
of
disease
assuming
you
are
lucky
enough
to
have
a
disease
which
can
be
treated
a
rich
person
with
a
terminal
disease
is
a
bit
out
of
luck
there
is
no
such
thing
as
adequately
covered
and
there
never
will
be
and
for
what
its
worth
ill
be
the
first
to
admit
that
all
my
patients
die
