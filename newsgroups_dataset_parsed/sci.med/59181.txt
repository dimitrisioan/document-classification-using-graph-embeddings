JOHN

WRITES
A
FRIEND
HAS
WHAT
IS
APPARENTLY
A
FAIRLY
MINOR
CASE
OF
CROHNS
DISEASE
BUT
SHE
CANT
SEEM
TO
EAT
CERTAIN
FOODS
SUCH
AS
FRESH
VEGETABLES
WITHOUT
DISCOMFORT
AND
OF
COURSE
SHE
WANTS
TO
AVOID
A
RECURRENCE
HER
QUESTION
IS
ARE
THERE
ANY
NUTRITIONISTS
WHO
SPECIALIZE
IN
THE
PROBLEMS
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
CROHNS
DISEASE
I
SAW
THE
SUGGESTION
OF
LIPOXYGNASE
INHIBITORS
LIKE
TEA
AND
TURMERIC
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
JOHN
EYLES
ALL
YOUR
FRIEND
REALLY
HAS
TO
DO
IS
FIND
A
REGISTERED
DIETICIANRD
WHILE
MOST
WORK
IN
HOSPITALS
AND
CLINICS
MANY
MAJOR
CITIES
WILL
HAVE
RDS
WHO
ARE
IN
PRIVATE
PRACTICE
SO
TO
SPEAK
MANY
PHYSICANS
WILL
REFER
THEIR
PATIENTS
WITH
CROHNS
DISEASE
TO
RDS
FOR
DIETARY
HELP
IF
YOU
CAN
GET
YOUR
FRIENDS
PHYSICIAN
TO
MAKE
A
REFERRAL
MEDICAL
INSURANCE
SHOULD
PAY
FOR
THE
RDS
SERVICES
JUST
LIKE
THE
SERVICES
OF
A
PHYSICAL
THERAPIST
THE
BETTER
MEDICAL
INSURANCE
PLANS
WILL
COVER
THIS
BUT
EVEN
IF
YOUR
FRIENDS
PLAN
DOESNT
IT
WOULD
BE
WELL
WORTH
THE
COST
TO
GET
ON
A
GOOD
DIET
TO
CONTROL
THE
INTESTINAL
DISCOMFORT
AND
HELP
THE
INTESTINAL
LINING
HEAL
CROHNS
DISEASE
IS
AN
INFLAMMATORY
DISEASE
OF
THE
INTESTINAL
LINING
AND
LIPOXYGENASE
INHIBITORS
MAY
HELP
BY
DECREASING
LEUKOTRIENE
FORMATION
BUT
IM
NOT
AWARE
OF
TEA
OR
TURMERIC
CONTAINING
LIPOXYGENASE
INHIBITORS
FOR
BAD
INFLAMMATION
STEROIDS
ARE
USED
BUT
FOR
A
MILD
CASE
THE
SIDE
EFFECTS
ARE
NOT
WORTH
THE
SMALL
BENEFIT
GAINED
BY
STEROID
USE
UPJOHN
IS
DEVELOPING
A
NEW
LIPOXYGENASE
INHIBITOR
THAT
SHOULD
GREATLY
HELP
DEAL
WITH
INFLAMMATORY
DISEASES
BUT
ITS
NOT
AVAILABLE
YET
