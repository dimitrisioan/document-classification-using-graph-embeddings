i
remember
hearing
a
few
years
back
about
a
new
therapy
for
hyperactivity
which
involved
aggressively
eliminating
artificial
coloring
and
flavoring
from
the
diet
the
theory
which
was
backed
up
by
interesting
anecdotal
results
is
that
certain
people
are
just
way
more
sensitive
to
these
chemicals
than
other
people
i
dont
remember
any
connection
being
made
with
seizures
but
it
certainly
couldnt
hurt
to
try
an
allnatural
diet
yeah
the
feingold
diet
is
a
load
of
crap
children
diagnosed
with
add
who
are
placed
on
this
diet
show
no
improvement
in
their
intellectual
and
social
skills
which
in
fact
continue
to
decline
of
course
the
parents
who
are
enthusiastic
about
this
approach
lap
it
up
at
the
expense
of
their
childrens
development
so
much
for
the
value
of
interesting
anecdotal
results
people
will
believe
anything
if
they
want

aka
thanks
for
all
the
interest
in
this
problem
of
mine
i
dont
think
it
is
a
reaction
to
sugar
or
junk
food
per
se
since
kathryn
has
never
shown
any
signs
of
hyperactivity
or
changes
in
behavior
in
response
to
food
she
has
always
been
very
calm
and
dare
i
say
a
neat
smart
kid
the
fact
that
this
happened
while
eating
two
sugar
coated
cereals
made
by
kellogs
makes
me
think
she
might
be
having
an
allergic
reaction
to
something
in
the
coating
or
the
cereals
of
the
four
of
us
in
our
immediate
family
kathryn
shows
the
least
signs
of
the
hay
fever
running
nose
itchy
eyes
etc
but
we
have
a
lot
of
allergies
in
our
family
history
including
some
weird
food
allergies
nuts
mushrooms
anyway
our
next
trip
is
to
an
endocrinologist
to
check
out
the
body
chemistry
but
so
far
no
more
sugar
coated
cereals
and
no
more
seizures
either
every
day
that
goes
by
without
one
makes
me
heave
a
sigh
of
relief
thanks
again
