so
if
you
have
any
evidence
against
the
hypothesis
for
example
controlled
doubleblind
studies
showing
that
the
antifungals
dont
do
any
better
than
sugar
water
then
lets
hear
it
if
you
dont
then
what
we
have
is
anecdotal
and
uncontrolled
evidence
on
one
side
and
abject
disbelief
on
the
other
i
dont
have
any
evidence
against
water
from
lourdes
curing
ms
im
sure
there
is
anecdotal
evidence
that
it
does
do
you
really
think
that
in
the
absence
of
a
doubleblind
study
i
should
be
indifferent
to
the
hypothesis
that
water
from
lourdes
cures
ms
for
what
its
worth
i
know
of
only
one
double
blind
study
of
nystatin
for
candida
hypersensitivity
syndrome
it
was
published
in
the
new
england
journal
i
think
and
showed
no
benefit
on
systemic
symptoms
though
i
think
it
reduced
vaginal
yeast
infections
not
surprisingly
as
i
recall
the
yeast
crowd
had
some
major
objections
to
the
study
though
i
dont
remember
what
they
were
