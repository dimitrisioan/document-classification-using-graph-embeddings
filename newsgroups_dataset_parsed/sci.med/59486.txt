i
was
told
by
my
doctor
at
that
time
that
the
pain
was
comparable
to
that
of
childbirth
yes
by
a
male
doctor
so
im
sure
some
of
you
women
will
disagree
id
really
like
to
know
the
truth
in
this
so
maybe
some
of
you
women
who
have
had
a
baby
and
a
kidney
stone
could
fill
me
in
one
more
reason
for
men
to
learn
the
lamaze
breathing
techniques
in
order
to
be
able
to
get
some
pain
reduction
instantly
wherever
you
are
