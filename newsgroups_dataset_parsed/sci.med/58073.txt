YOUR
EXPERIENCE
IS
VALID
FOR
MANY
BUT
NOT
ALL
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
KNOW
A
FEW
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
OVERWEIGHT
AND
ARE
NOW
STABLE
AT
A
LOWER
NORMAL
OR
JUST
LESS
WEIGHT
DOES
NOT
CONTRADICT
THE
OBSERVATION
THAT
ONLY
PER
CENT
CAN
MAINTAIN
IDEAL
WEIGHT
WITH
CURRENT
TECHNOLOGY
ACTUALLY
THE
OBSERVATION
IS
THAT
ONLY
OF
THOSE
WHO
SEEK
HELP
FROM
YOUR
SOCALLED
DIET
EVANGELISTS
CAN
MAINTAIN
THEIR
WEIGHT
I
HAPPEN
TO
AGREE
WITH
KEITH
LYNCH
THAT
THERE
ARE
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
AND
DO
LOSE
WEIGHT
ON
THEIR
OWN
AND
WHO
ARE
NOT
REFLECTED
IN
THE
DISMAL
FAILURE
RATE
THAT
IS
OFTEN
QUOTED
WASNT
THERE
A
STUDY
WHERE
A
RESEARCHER
ASKED
A
MORE
GENERAL
POPULATION
PERHAPS
SOME
PART
OF
A
UNIVERSITY
COMMUNITY
ABOUT
WEIGHT
LOSS
AND
HESHE
FOUND
THAT
A
MUCH
HIGHER
PERCENTAGE
HAD
LOST
AND
MAINTAINED
IN
FACT
ADIPOSITY
MENTIONS
A
SIMILAR
STUDY
SEARCH
FOR
LIFE
EVENTS
IN
ANY
RECENT
VERSION
OF
ADIPOSITY
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
ANECDOTAL
REPORTS
ABOUT
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
HAVE
LOST
WEIGHT
AND
KEPT
IT
OFF
IS
THAT
WE
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
CAUSED
THE
WEIGHT
GAIN
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THIS
IS
CRITICAL
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
WHO
GAINS
WEIGHT
BECAUSE
OF
SOMETHING
TEMPORARY
DRUG
EFFECT
LIFE
EVENT
ETC
MAY
APPEAR
SUCCESSFUL
AT
DIETING
WHEN
THE
WEIGHT
LOSS
WAS
REALLY
THE
RESULT
OF
REVERSING
THE
TEMPORARY
CONDITION
THAT
CAUSED
THE
WEIGHT
GAIN
