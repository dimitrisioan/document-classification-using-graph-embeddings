MUCH
DELETED
THE
FACT
THAT
THIS
HAPPENED
WHILE
EATING
TWO
SUGAR
COATED
CEREALS
MADE
BY
KELLOGS
MAKES
ME
THINK
SHE
MIGHT
BE
HAVING
AN
ALLERGIC
REACTION
TO
SOMETHING
IN
THE
COATING
OR
THE
CEREALS
OF
THE
FOUR
OF
US
IN
OUR
IMMEDIATE
FAMILY
KATHRYN
SHOWS
THE
LEAST
SIGNS
OF
THE
HAY
FEVER
RUNNING
NOSE
ITCHY
EYES
ETC
BUT
WE
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
ALLERGIES
IN
OUR
FAMILY
HISTORY
INCLUDING
SOME
WEIRD
FOOD
ALLERGIES
NUTS
MUSHROOMS
MANY
OF
THESE
CEREALS
ARE
CORNBASED
AFTER
YOUR
POST
I
LOOKED
IN
THE
LITERATURE
AND
LOCATED
TWO
ARTICLES
THAT
IMPLICATED
CORN
CONTAINS
TRYPTOPHAN
AND
SEIZURES
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
CORN
IN
THE
DIET
MIGHT
POTENTIATE
AN
ALREADY
EXISTING
OR
LATENT
SEIZURE
DISORDER
NOT
CAUSE
IT
CHECK
TO
SEE
IF
THE
TWO
KELLOG
CEREALS
ARE
CORN

A
COUPLE
OF
FOLKS
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THE
CORN
CONNECTION
IN
THE
FIVE
MONTH
PERIOD
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
SEIZURES
MY
DAUGHTER
HAD
EATEN
A
FAIR
AMOUNT
OF
KIX
AND
BERRY
BERRY
KIX
IN
THE
MORNINGS
AND
NEVER
HAD
A
PROBLEM
I
CHECKED
THE
LABELS
AND
THE
FIRST
INGREDIENT
IS
CORN
SHE
HAS
ALSO
NEVER
HAD
A
PROBLEM
EATING
CORN
OR
CORN
ON
THE
COB
BUT
OF
COURSE
THAT
IS
USUALLY
LATER
IN
THE
DAY
WITH
A
FULL
STOMACH
SO
THE
ABSORPTION
WOULD
NOT
BE
SO
HIGH
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
FROST
FLAKES
HAVE
CORN
IN
THEM
BUT
I
WILL
HAVE
TO
CHECK
THE
FRUIT
LOOPS
BUT
THE
FACT
THAT
SHE
HAS
EATEN
THIS
OTHER
CORNY
CEREAL
IN
THE
MORNING
MAKES
ME
WONDER
THANKS
FOR
CHECKING
INTO
THIS
ALL
INFORMATION
AT
THIS
POINT
IS
VALUABLE

ME
