CONTRACEPTIVE
PILL
A
VERY
SIMPLE
QUESTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
CONTRACEPTIVE
PILL
JUST
PREVENTS
THE
OVULE
TO
NEST
IN
THE
VAGINA
AND
FORCES
IT
TO
FALL
EVERY
MONTH
BUT
IT
DOES
NOT
PREVENT
THE
FERTILZATION
OF
THE
OVULE
IS
IT
TRUE
IF
YES
IS
THERE
A
RISK
OF
EXTRAUTERINE
PREGNANCY
THAT
IS
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
OVULE
INSIDE
THE
FALLOPIAN
TUBE
