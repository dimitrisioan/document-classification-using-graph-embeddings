I
NEED
INFORMATION
ON
THE
MEDICAL
INCLUDING
EMOTIONAL
PROS
AND
CONS
OF
CIRCUMCISION
AT
BIRTH
I
AM
ESPECIALLY
INTERESTED
IN
REFERENCES
TO
STUDIES
THAT
INDICATE
DISADVANTAGES
OR
REFUTE
STUDIES
THAT
INDICATE
ADVANTAGES
A
FRIEND
WHO
IS
A
MEDICAL
STUDENT
IS
WRITING
A
SURVEY
PAPER
AND
APPARENTLY
THE
STUDIES
SHE
HAS
RUN
INTO
ARE
ALL
FOR
CIRCUMCISION
THE
MAIN
ARGUMENT
BEING
A
LOWER
RISK
OF
PENILE
CANCER
PLEASE
EMAIL
RESPONSES
AS
I
AM
NOT
A
FREQUENT
READER
OF
EITHER
GROUP
I
WILL
SUMMARIZE
TO
THE
NET
IM
VERY
SURPRISED
THAT
MEDICAL
SCHOOLS
STILL
PUSH
ROUTINE
CIRCUMCISION
OF
NEWBORN
MALES
ON
THE
POPULATION
SINCE
YOUR
FRIEND
IS
NOT
A
MAN
SHE
CANT
IMAGINE
WHAT
ITS
LIKE
TO
HAVE
A
PENIS
MUCH
LESS
A
FORESKIN
I
GUESS
IF
AMERICAN
MEDICINE
DID
AN
ARTISTIC
JOB
OF
CIRCUMCISING
EVERY
MALE
THEN
THE
VISUAL
RESULT
WOULD
BE
SOMEWHAT
MORE
NATURAL
IN
APPEARANCE
THE
PENILE
CANCER
THING
HAS
BEEN
COMPLETELY
DEBUNKEDSHE
MUST
BE
GOING
TO
SCHOOL
ON
A
SOUTH
PACIFIC
ISLAND
TELL
HER
TO
CHECK
THE
JOURNAL
OR
UROLOGY
FOR
CIRCUMCISION
ARTICLES
I
REMEMBER
AT
LEAST
ON
AN
OLD
JEWISH
MAN
CUT
AT
BIRTH
WHO
DEVELOPED
PENILE
CANCERI
MEAN
IF
THE
CANCER
RISK
WAS
THAT
GREAT
THE
EUROPE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
CIRCUMCISING
LIKE
CRAZY
TOO
TEACHING
A
BOY
HOW
TO
KEEP
HIS
COCKHEAD
CLEAN
IS
THE
ISSUE
A
LITTLE
PROPER
HYGIENE
GOES
A
LONG
WAY
AMERICANS
ARE
JUST
TOO
HUNG
UP
ON
THE
PENIS
TO
CONSIDER
CLEANING
IT
THATS
JUST
WAY
TOO
MUCH
LIKE
MASTUBATION
SO
YOU
HAVE
SURGICAL
INTERVENTION
THAT
IS
BASICALLY
UNNECESSARY
