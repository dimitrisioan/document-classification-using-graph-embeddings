A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IS
SEEING
AN
ACUPUNCTURIST
AND
WANTS
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
DANGER
OF
GETTING
AIDS
FROM
THE
NEEDLES
ASK
THE
PRACTITIONER
WHETHER
HE
USES
THE
PRESTERILIZED
DISPOSABLE
NEEDLES
OR
IF
HE
REUSES
NEEDLES
STERILIZING
THEM
BETWEEN
USE
IN
THE
FORMER
CASE
THERES
NO
CONCEIVABLE
WAY
TO
GET
AIDS
FROM
THE
NEEDLES
IN
THE
LATTER
CASE
ITS
HIGHLY
UNLIKELY
THOUGH
MANY
PRACTITIONERS
USE
THE
DISPOSABLE
VARIETY
ANYWAY
EUCLID
EUCLID

STANDARD
DISCLAIMERS
APPLY
IT
IS
A
BIT
IRONIC
THAT
WE
NEED
THE
WAVE
MODEL
OF
LIGHT
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
PROPAGATION
OF
LIGHT
ONLY
THROUGH
THAT
PART
OF
THE
SYSTEM
WHERE
IT
LEAVES
NO
TRACE
