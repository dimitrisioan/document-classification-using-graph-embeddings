okay
this
is
a
long
shot
my
friend
robin
has
recurring
bouts
of
mononucleosistype
symptoms
very
regularly
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
number
of
years
shes
seen
a
number
of
doctors
six
was
the
last
count
i
think
most
of
them
have
said
either
you
have
mono
or
youre
full
of
it
theres
nothing
wrong
with
you
one
has
admitted
to
having
no
idea
what
was
wrong
with
her
and
one
has
claimed
that
it
is
epsteinbarr
syndrome
now
what
she
told
me
about
ebs
is
that
very
few
doctors
even
believe
that
it
exists
obviously
this
has
been
her
experience
so
whats
the
story
is
it
real
does
the
medical
profession
believe
it
to
be
real
has
anyone
had
success
is
treating
ebs
or
is
it
just
something
to
live
with
thanks
for
your
assistance
outbreaks
of
a
chronicmonolike
entity
were
originally
called
ebs
or
some
variant
thereof
because
most
of
the
people
with
this
disease
had
elevated
levels
of
antibodies
to
the
ebv
virus
but
not
all
of
them
did
which
prompted
an
official
renaming
of
the
disease
to
chronic
fatigue
syndrome
this
renaming
took
place
in
the
annals
of
internal
medicine
jan
i
believe
now
its
also
called
chronic
fatigue
and
immune
dysfunction
syndrome
cfids
since
it
seems
clear
that
some
sort
of
immune
disregulation
is
causing
the
probs
astonishly
there
are
still
docs
who
tell
people
with
massively
swollen
glands
recurrent
fevers
and
nightsweats
etc
that
theres
nothing
wrong
with
them
this
is
not
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
the
syndrome
may
have
a
at
least
partly
psychological
cause
the
disagreement
among
people
whose
thoughts
are
worth
considering
centers
on
just
what
the
cause
is
no
one
knows
but
theories
include
psychological
stress
some
sort
of
virus
a
retrovirus
say
most
maybe
one
of
the
newly
discovered
herpes
viruses
environmental
toxins
bacteria
and
yes
candida
genes
andor
some
combo
of
these
theres
no
outright
cure
at
the
moment
but
different
docs
try
different
things
some
of
which
seem
to
help
massive
amounts
of
info
on
the
condition
are
available
these
days
post
your
q
to
altmedcfs
and
you
will
be
flooded
wfacts
note
there
are
lots
of
far
better
understood
and
better
treatable
diseases
that
look
like
cfids
make
sure
these
get
ruledout
by
a
good
doc
