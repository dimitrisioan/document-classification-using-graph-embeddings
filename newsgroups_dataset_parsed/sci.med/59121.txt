RE
KRILLEAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
I
DID
A
SCIENCE
PROJECT
ON
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
HIGH
SCHOOL
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
OBTAIN
WONDERFUL
AURAS
FROM
ROCKS
AND
PEBBLES
AND
THE
LIKE
BY
FIRST
DUNKING
THEM
IN
WATER
I
KNOW
THIS
IS
A
LITTLE
WEIRD
BUT
I
KNOW
THAT
WORLD
MAGAZINE
YOU
KNOW
NATIONAL
GEO
FOR
CHILDREN
DID
A
VERY
SIMPLE
AND
CONCISE
ARTICLE
ON
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY

HAD
SOME
NEAT
PICTURES

A
FRIEND
OF
MINES
MOTHER
HAD
A
BOOK
ON
KIRLIAN
PHOTOGRAPHY
ONLY
ITS
PHOTOGRAPHS
TOOK
A
RADIOLOGIST
TO
INTERPRET
THEY
WORLD
MAGAZINE
WARNED
US
ALL

IT
WAS
VERY
DANGEROUS
PROBABLY
TO
STOP
CURIOUS
CHILDREN
FROM
EXPERIMENTING
WITH
IT
MIND

WAS
YEARS
AGO
AT
LEAST
AND
BOY
