mujanovic
was
a
pathologist
when
he
trekked
through
the
mountains
to
the
besieged
muslim
town
of
srebrenica
last
august
but
after
treating
mangled
victims
of
bosnias
bloody
war
he
considers
himself
a
surgeon
now
im
a
surgeon
with
great
experience
although
i
have
no
license
to
practice
but
if
i
operate
on
a
person
and
he
lives
normally
thats
the
greatest
license
a
surgeon
could
have
evacuated
by
the
un
this
week
to
his
home
town
of
tuzla
the
muslim
physician
gave
an
eyewitness
medical
assessment
of
the
horrors
of
the
yearlong
serb
siege
of
srebrenica
and
the
suffering
of
the
thousands
trapped
there
i
lived
through
hell
together
with
the
people
of
srebrenica
all
those
who
lived
through
this
are
the
greatest
heroes
that
humanity
can
produce
he
told
reporters
mujanovic
had
practiced
for
two
months
as
an
assistant
at
a
local
hospital
in
tuzla
but
before
going
to
srebrenica
he
had
never
performed
a
surgical
operation
on
his
own
now
he
says
he
has
performed
major
surgery
times
relying
on
books
for
guidance
amputating
arms
and
legs
times
usually
without
anesthetic
delivering
babies
and
performing
four
cesarean
sections
he
worked
days
slept
in
the
hospital
for
the
first
weeks
after
his
arrival
last
aug
and
treated
patients
he
arrived
after
making
the
trek
over
mountains
on
foot
from
tuzla
miles
northwest
of
srebrenica
about
other
people
carried
in
supplies
and
soldiers
guided
and
protected
him
through
guerrilla
terrain
he
said
his
worst
memory
was
of
days
ago
when
seven
serb
shells
landed
within
one
minute
in
an
area
half
the
size
of
a
football
field
killing
people
immediately
and
wounding
half
of
the
dead
were
women
and
children
the
people
had
come
out
for
a
rare
day
of
sunshine
and
the
children
were
playing
soccer
there
was
no
warning
the
blood
flowed
like
a
river
in
the
street
he
said
there
were
pieces
of
women
all
around
and
you
could
not
piece
them
together
one
woman
holding
her
two
children
in
her
hands
was
lying
with
them
on
the
ground
dead
they
had
no
heads
before
mujanovic
arrived
with
his
supplies
conditions
were
deplorable
he
said
many
deaths
could
have
been
prevented
had
the
hospital
had
surgical
tools
facilities
and
medicine
the
six
general
practitioners
who
had
been
operating
before
he
arrived
had
even
less
surgical
experience
than
he
did
they
didnt
know
the
basic
principles
for
amputating
limbs
once
he
arrived
the
situation
improved
he
said
but
by
midseptember
he
had
run
out
of
supplies
bandages
were
washed
and
boiled
five
times
sometimes
they
were
falling
apart
in
my
hands
he
said
doctors
had
no
anesthetic
and
could
not
give
patients
alcohol
to
numb
the
pain
because
it
increased
bleeding
people
were
completely
conscious
during
amputations
and
stomach
operations
he
said
blood
transfusions
were
impossible
because
they
had
no
facilities
to
test
blood
types
i
felt
destroyed
psychologically
mujanovic
said
the
situation
improved
after
dec
when
a
convoy
arrived
from
the
belgian
medical
group
medecins
sans
frontieres
but
mujanovic
said
the
military
predicament
worsened
in
middecember
after
bosnian
serbs
began
a
major
offensive
in
the
region
every
day
we
had
air
strikes
and
shellings
then
the
hunger
set
in
between
middecember
and
midmarch
when
us
planes
began
air
dropping
food
between
and
people
were
dying
every
day
from
complications
associated
with
malnutrition
he
said
i
know
for
sure
that
the
air
drop
operation
saved
the
people
from
massive
death
by
hunger
and
starvation
he
said
according
to
mujanovic
around
people
died
in
srebrenica
of
them
children
during
a
year
of
siege
mujanovic
plans
to
return
to
srebrenica
in
three
weeks
after
visiting
his
wife
who
is
ill
in
tuzla
they
say
im
a
hero
he
said
there
were
thousands
of
people
standing
at
the
sides
of
the
road
crying
and
waving
when
i
left
and
i
cried
too
