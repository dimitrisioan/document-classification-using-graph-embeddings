THYROXIN
CONTROLS
ENERGY
PRODUCTION
WHICH
EXPLAINS
SLEEPINESS
COLDNESS
AND
WEIGHT
GAIN
THERE
IS
ALSO
WATER
RETENTION
POSSIBLY
AROUND
HEART
CHANGES
IN
VISION
AND
COARSER
HAIR
AND
SKIN
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
IS
THERE
ANY
RELATION
BETWEEN
THYROID
DEFICIENCY
AND
DEPRESSION
PERHAPS
THE
LISTLESSNESS
CAUSED
BY
THYROID
DEFICIENCY
COULD
MIMIC
DEPRESSION
OR
FEELING
UNABLE
TO
DO
ANYTHING
COULD
CAUSE
ONE
TO
GET
DEPRESSED
BUT
I
KNOW
OF
NO
SPECIFIC
EFFECT
ON
THE
BRAIN
CAUSED
BY
THE
THYROID
THAT
WOULD
CAUSE
DEPRESSION
NOTE
THAT
WEIGHT
GAIN
IS
USUALLY
A
SYMPTOM
OF
BOTH
SIMPLE
BLOOD
TESTS
WOULD
INDICATE
IF
A
THYROID
CONDITION
IS
PRESENT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
DEPRESSION
WOULD
CAUSE
A
REDUCTION
IN
THYROID
OUTPUT
BUT
I
WOULD
TEND
TO
DOUBT
IT
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
CLINICAL
DEPRESSION
IS
CAUSED
BY
A
CHEMICAL
IMBALANCE
IN
THE
BRAIN
AND
THAT
CHEMICAL
IMBALANCE
HAS
NO
DIRECT
EFFECT
ON
ANY
OTHER
PART
OF
THE
BODY
A
REGULAR
EVERYDAY
DEPRESSION
IMHO
SHOULD
NOT
CAUSE
A
CHEMICAL
IMBALANCE
IN
THE
BODY
AT
ALL
THE
PITUITARY
BASES
ITS
SECRETIONS
OF
THYROID
STIMULATING
HORMONE
TSH
ON
THE
LEVEL
OF
CIRCULATING
THYROXIN
THERE
ARE
TWO
TYPES
AND
ONE
IS
USED
AS
A
RESERVE
AND
IS
CHANGED
INTO
THE
OTHER
ACTIVE
FORM
IN
THE
LIVER
THE
RATIO
OF
CAN
BE
AFFECTED
BY
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
HORMONES
ESTROGEN
FOR
EXAMPLE
NATURALLY
CHANGING
ACTIVITY
OF
THE
BODYS
CELLS
WOULD
CAUSE
CHANGES
IN
AVAILABILTY
OF
FREE
THYROXIN
BUT
THE
LIVER
AND
A
HEALTHY
THYROID
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
BALANCE
THINGS
OUT
IN
SHORT
ORDER
GOOD
SOURCES
FOR
INFO
ON
THE
THYROID
ARE
THE
MERK
MANUAL
A
PHYSICIANS
REFERENCE
BOOK
ALTHOUGH
READING
IT
IS
ENOUGH
TO
GET
ONE
DEPRESSED
AND
THE
ENCYCLOPEDIA
BRITTANICA
SHOULD
BE
AVAILABLE
IN
YOUR
LOCAL
LIBRARY
I
HOPE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
OF
SOME
HELP
