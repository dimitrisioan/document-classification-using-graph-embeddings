BIOLOGICAL
ALCHEMY
ROBERT
IM
SO
GLAD
THAT
YOU
POSTED
YOUR
BIOLOGICAL
ALCHEMY
DISCUSSION
IVE
BEEN
COMPARED
TO
THE
FAMOUS
ROBERT
MCELWAINE
BY
SOME
READERS
OF
SCI
MED
I
DIDNT
KNOW
HOW
TO
RESPOND
SINCE
I
HAD
NOT
SEEN
ONE
OF
YOUR
POSTSJUST
LIKE
I
HAVENT
READ
THE
YEAST
CONNECTION
LET
ME
JUST
START
BY
STATING
THAT
THE
AUTHORS
OF
THE
COLD
FUSION
PAPERS
OF
RECENT
YEARS
ARE
NOW
IN
SCIENTIFIC
EXILEI
BELIEVE
THAT
ONE
HAS
ACTUALLY
LEFT
THE
COUNTRY
SCIENTIFIC
FRAUD
IS
RARE
IM
STILL
NOT
SURE
THAT
IF
A
REVIEW
OF
THE
RESEARCH
NOTES
OF
THE
COLD
FUSION
SCIENTISTS
ACTUALLY
PROVED
FRAUD
OR
JUST
VERY
SHODDY
EXPERIMENTATION
YOUR
SOURCES
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
BE
RESEARCH
ARTICLES
THEY
ARE
MORE
LIKE

ROBERT
I
TRY
TO
KEEP
AN
OPEN
MIND
BUT
SOME
THINGS
I
JUST
CANT
BUYONE
IS
TAKING
SOD
ORALLY
TO
PREVENT
OXIDATIVE
DAMAGE
IN
THE
BODY
YOUR
EXPERIMENT
IF
CONDUCTED
BY
READERS
OF
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
WOULD
PROVE
THAT
YOU
ARE
RIGHTMORE
ASH
AFTER
SEED
SPROUTING
THAN
BEFORE
UNLESS
YOU
USE
A
MUFFLE
FURNANCE
AND
OBTAIN
A
VERY
HIGH
TEMPERATUREABOVE
DEGREES
I
BELIEVE
YOU
WILL
GET
ORGANIC
RESIDUE
IN
THE
ASH
EVEN
THE
RESIDUE
IN
COMMERCIAL
INCINERATORS
CONTAINS
ORGANIC
RESIDUE
I
REMEMBER
DOING
THIS
KIND
OF
EXPERIMENT
IN
MY
ORGANIC
CHEMISTRY
COUURSE
IN
COLLEGE
BUT
I
COULDNT
FIND
A
TEMPERATURE
FOR
MINERAL
ASH
FORMATION
SO
IM
REALLY
GUESSING
AT
DEGREES
F
IT
MAY
ACTUALLY
BE
MUCH
HIGHER
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
NO
ONE
IN
THEIR
HOME
COULD
EVER
GET
A
HIGH
ENOUGH
TEMPERATURE
TO
PRODUCE
ONLY
A
MINERAL
ASH
THEY
ALSO
COULD
NOT
MEASURE
THE
MINERALS
SO
THEY
COULD
ONLY
WEIGH
THE
ASH
AND
FIND
OUT
THAT
YOU
APPEAR
TO
BE
CORRECT
CHEMICAL
REACTIONS
ABOUND
IN
OUR
BODY
IN
OUR
ATMOSPHERE
IN
OUR
WATER
AND
IN
OUR
SOIL
ARE
THESE
FUSION
REACTIONS
YES
MANY
OF
THEM
DO
INVOLVE
FUSING
OXYGEN
NITROGEN
AND
SULFUR
TO
BOTH
ORGANICS
AND
INORGANICS
DO
WE
REALLY
HAVE
THE
TRANSFORMATION
OF
SILICONE
TO
CALCIUM
IF
CARBON
IS
FUSED
WITH
SILICON
NOT
IN
MY
BOOK
ROBERT
SILICON
IS
THE
MOST
ABUNDANT
MINERAL
ON
OUR
PLANET
IVE
SEEN
SPECULATION
THAT
MAN
COULD
HAVE
EVOLVED
TO
BE
A
SILICON
BASED
RATHER
THAN
A
CARBON
BASED
LIFEFORM
I
LIKE
READING
SCIENCE
FICTION
AS
MANY
PEOPLE
DO
BUT
I
KNOW
ENOUGH
ABOUT
BIOCHEMISTRYAND
NUTRITION
TO
BE
ABLEIN
MOST
CASES
TO
SEPARATE
THE
FICTION
FROM
THE
FACT
SILICON
MAY
BE
ONE
OF
THE
TRACE
ELEMENTS
THAT
TURNS
OUT
TO
BE
ESSENTIAL
IN
HUMANS
WE
HAVE
SEVERAL
GRAMS
OF
THE
STUFF
IN
OUR
BODY
WHATS
IT
DOING
THERE
ONLY
THE
LORD
KNOWS
RIGHT
NOW
BUT
I
WILL
TELL
YOU
WHAT
I
DO
KNOW
ABOUT
SILICON
AND
WHY
AS
YOU
STATE
IT
HELPS
BONE
HEALINGAND
IT
IS
NOT
BECAUSE
SILICON
IS
TRANSFORMED
INTO
CALCIUM
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THE
SILICON
IN
THE
HUMAN
BODY
IS
FOUND
IN
THE
CONNECTIVE
TISSUECOLLAGEN
AND
ELASTIN
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
STUDIES
PUBLISHED
WHICH
SHOW
THAT
THE
VERY
HIGH
SILICON
CONTENT
IN
ELASTIN
MAY
BE
AN
IMPORTANT
PROTECTIVE
FACTOR
AGAINST
ATHEROSCLEROSISTHE
HIGHER
THE
SILICON
CONTENT
IN
ELASTIN
THE
MORE
RESISTANT
THE
ELASTIN
IS
TO
A
AN
AGERELATED
LOSS
OF
ELASTICITY
WHICH
MAY
PLAY
A
ROLE
IN
THE
INCREASE
IN
BLOOD
PRESSURE
THAT
IS
OFTEN
SEEN
AS
PART
OF
THE
AGEING
PROCESS
IN
HUMANS
FOR
BONE
FRACTURE
HEALING
THE
FIRST
STEP
IS
A
COLLAGEN
MATRIX
INTO
WHICH
CALCIUM
AND
PHOSPHATE
ARE
PUMPED
BY
OSTEOBLASTS
A
HIGH
LEVEL
OF
SILICON
IN
THE
DIET
SEEMS
TO
SPEED
UP
THIS
MATRIX
FORMATION
THIS
FIRST
STEP
IN
THE
BONE
HEALING
PROCESS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
HARDEST
FOR
SOME
PEOPLE
TO
GET
GOING
ELECTRIACL
CURRENTS
HAVE
BEEN
USED
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
GET
THE
MATRIX
FORMING
CELLS
ORIENTED
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
SO
THAT
THE
MATRIX
CAN
BE
FORMED
IN
THE
GAPOR
GAPS
BETWEEN
THE
ENDS
OF
THE
BROKEN
BONE
A
VITAMIN
C
DEFICIENCY
BY
SLOWING
COLLAGEN
FORMATION
AS
WELL
AS
CAUSING
THE
PRODCUTION
OF
DEFECTIVE
COLLAGEN
DOES
SLOW
DOWN
BOTH
BONE
AND
WOUND
HEALING
ZINC
IS
ALSO
ANOTHER
BIG
PLAYER
IN
BONE
AND
WOUND
HEALING
AND
SO
IS
SILICONIN
AN
UNDETERMINED
ROLE
THAT
MOST
LIKELY
INVOLES
MATRIX
FORMATION
AND
NOT
TRANSFORMATION
OF
SILICON
TO
CALCIUM
FOR
YOU
TO
TAKE
THIS
BONE
HEALING
OBSERVATION
AND
USE
IT
AS
PROOF
THAT
SILICON
IS
TRANSFORMED
INTO
CALCIUM
IS
AN
INTERESTING
LITTLE
TRICK
BUT
ROBERT
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
MYSELF
WHEN
I
READ
THE
LAY
PRESSAND
YES
EVEN
SOME
SCIENTIFIC
PAPERS
IS
THE
EXPLANATION
REASONABLE
WITHOUT
A
VERY
GOOD
SCIENCE
KNOWLEDGE
BASE
YOU
AND
MOST
READERS
OF
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
ARE
FLYING
BLINDYOU
HAVE
TO
TAKE
IT
ON
FAITH
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
KNOW
ANY
BETTER
IF
THE
EXPLANATION
SEEMS
TO
MAKE
SENSE
TO
ME
BASED
ON
MY
KNOWLEDGE
BASE
IM
INCLINED
TO
CONSIDER
ITTHIS
USUALLY
MEANS
TRYING
TO
FIND
OTHER
SOURCES
THAT
COME
TO
THE
SAME
CONCLUSION
IF
THE
IDEALIKE
A
CANDIDA
BLOOM
SEEMS
TO
MAKE
SENSE
TO
ME
I
TEND
TO
PURSUE
IT
AS
LONG
AS
ANY
ADVICE
THAT
IM
GOING
TO
GIVE
ISNT
GOING
TO
REALLY
MESS
SOMEBODY
UP
IF
THIS
MAKES
US
KINDRED
SOULS
ROBERT
THEN
I
GUESS
ILL
HAVE
TO
LIVE
WITH
THAT
LABEL
FOR
THE
PHYSICIANS
WHO
HAVE
DECIDED
TO
READ
MY
RESPONSE
TO
ROBERTS
INTERESTING
POST
I
HOPE
THAT
YOU
SAW
THE
SEGMENT
ON
THE
PEDIATRIC
NEUROSURGEON
LAST
NIGHT
ON
US
TV
I
CANT
REMEMBER
THE
NETWORK
OR
HIS
NAMELIKE
MANY
NIGHTS
I
WAS
ON
MY
COMPUTER
AND
MY
WIFE
WAS
WATCHING
TV
IN
OUR
DEN
WHERE
I
HAVE
MY
COMPUTER
SETUP
THIS
NEUROSURGEON
TAKES
KIDS
WITH
BRAIN
TUMORS
THAT
EVERYONE
ELSE
HAS
GIVEN
UP
ON
AND
HE
USESUNCONVENTIONAL
TREATMENTSHIS
OWN
WORDS
HE
SAYS
THAT
HE
HAS
A
SUCCESS
RATE
THE
ONE
CASE
THAT
I
HEARD
HIM
DISCUSSING
WOULD
NORMALLY
USE
RADIATIONCONVENTIONAL
TREATMENT
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
GO
IN
AND
CUT
YOU
GUYS
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THE
COST
OF
THE
ANTIFUNGALS
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
COST
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
RADIATION
TREATMENT
AND
SURGERY
IS
GUYS
IM
GOING
TO
ASK
YOU
GUYS
ONE
MORE
TIME
WHY
BLAST
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
TAKES
THE
CHRONIC
SINUS
SUFFERERLIKE
JON
AND
THE
CHRONIC
GI
SUFFERERLIKE
ELAINE
AND
TRIES
TO
HELP
THEM
USING
UNCONVENTIONAL
TREATMENTS
TREATMENTS
WHICH
DO
NOT
RESULT
IN
DEATHLIKE
THOSE
THAT
THE
NEUROSURGEON
USES
IS
IT
BECAUSE
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
ARE
NOT
LIFETHREATENING
WHILE
BRAIN
TUMORS
ARE
HOW
ABOUT
QUALITY
OF
LIFE
GUYS
MAY
THE
CANDIDA
DEMON
NEVER
CROSS
YOUR
SINUS
CAVITY
OR
GUTIF
IT
DOES
YOU
MAY
FEEL
DIFFERENTLY
ABOUT
THE
ISSUE
