MARK
ROBERT
THORSON
WRITES
AN
ODD
EXCEPTION
TO
THE
RULE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
PRODUCT
KNOWN
AS
GUMBO
FILE
THIS
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
COARSELY
GROUND
DRIED
SASSAFRAS
LEAVES
THIS
IS
NOT
ONLY
A
NATURAL
PRODUCT
BUT
A
NATURAL
PRODUCT
STILL
IN
ITS
NATURAL
FORM
SO
MAYBE
THATS
HOW
THEY
EVADE
DELANY
OR
MAYBE
A
SPECIAL
EXEMPTION
WAS
MADE
TO
APPEASE
POWERFUL
LOUISIANA
DEMOCRATS
ONE
POSSIBLE
REASON
IS
THAT
FILE
IS
MADE
WITH
SASSAFRAS
LEAVES
WHILE
ROOT
BEER
WAS
MADE
WITH
SASSAFRAS
BARK
OR
ROOT
BARK
THE
LEAVES
CONTAIN
EITHER
NO
OR
LESS
SAFFROLE
THAN
THE
BARK
THERE
IS
ALSO
SOME
SORT
OF
TREATMENT
WHICH
PUTATIVELY
REMOVES
SAFFROLE
FROM
SASSAFRAS
PRODUCTS
I
HAVE
SOME
CONCENTRATED
SASSAFRAS
TEA
EXTRACT
WHICH
IS
CLAIMED
TO
HAVE
THE
SAFFROLE
REMOVED
I
THINK
WHAT
WE
HAVE
TO
KEEP
IN
MIND
IS
THAT
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
MAY
BE
ILLEGAL
TO
COMMERCIALLY
PRODUCESELL
FOOD
WITH
CARCINOGENIC
SUBSTANCES
IT
IS
NOT
ILLEGAL
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
DO
SUCH
TO
THEIR
OWN
FOOD
SMOKING
ETC
IS
THIS
TRUE
WELL
THE
LAST
TIME
THAT
I
WENT
TO
THE
STORE
TO
BUY
SASSAFRAS
BARK
TO
MAKE
ROOT
BEER
THERE
WAS
A
SIGN
SAYING
THAT
IT
WASNT
SOLD
FOR
HUMAN
CONSUMPTION
ALSO
WHEN
I
ASKED
THE
PERSON
IF
THEY
HAD
WILD
CHERRY
BARK
AND
WINTERGREEN
BARK
SHE
MADE
A
POINT
OF
TELLING
ME
THAT
I
COULDNT
BUY
SASSAFRAS
FOR
HUMAN
CONSUMPTION
I
FIND
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
RECKLESS
ENOUGH
TO
STEP
INTO
AN
AUTOMOBILE
LIVE
IN
FEAR
OF
DROPPING
DEAD
BECAUSE
OF
A
PORK
