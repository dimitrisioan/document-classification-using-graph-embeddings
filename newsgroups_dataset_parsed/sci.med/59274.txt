REUSE
OF
HALDOL
AND
THE
ELDERLY
IM
A
NURSING
STUDENT
AND
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
RESPOND
TO
ON
HALDOL
AND
THE
ELDERLY
MESSAGEID
ORGANIZATION
FLORIDA
STATE

FIRST
IM
SORRY
TO
HEAR
THAT
YOU
HAVE
HAD
TO
SEE
YOUR
GRANDMOTHER
GO
THROUGH
THIS
I
KNOW
IT
HAS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
TOUGH
THERE
ARE
MANY
THINGS
THAT
CAN
CAUSE
LONG
TERM
CONFUSION
IN
ELDERLY
ADULTS
THE
CHANGE
IN
ENVIRONMENT
CAN
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
ANESTHETIC
AGENTS
CAN
CAUSE
CONFUSION
BECAUSE
THE
BODY
CANNOT
CLEAR
THE
MEDICINES
OUT
OF
THE
BODY
AS
EASILY
IN
ADDITION
MEDICATIONS
AND
INTERACTIONS
BETWEEN
MEDICATIONS
CAN
CAUSE
CONFUSION
AS
FAR
AS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HALDOL
CAN
HAVE
LONG
LASTING
EFFECTS
EVEN
AFTER
THE
DRUG
HAS
BEEN
DISCONTINUED
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
ANYTHING
TO
THAT
EFFECT
HOWEVER
I
ALSO
HAD
NOT
BEEN
LOOKING
FOR
THAT
INFORMATION
I
CAN
SEE
WHAT
I
CAN
FIND
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
HALDOL
IS
AN
ANTIPSYCHOTIC
DRUG
AND
ACCORDING
TO
THE
DRUG
HANDBOOK
IT
IS
ESPECIALLY
USEFUL
FOR
AGITATION
ASSOCIATED
WITH
SENILE
DEMENTIA
P
IT
ALSO
SHOULD
NOT
BE
DISCONTINUED
ABRUPTLY
IT
DID
NOT
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
LONG
LASTING
EFFECTS
BECAUSE
SO
MANY
THINGS
CAN
CAUSE
CONFUSION
IT
IS
HARD
FOR
ME
TO
KNOW
WHAT
ELSE
WAS
GOING
ON
AT
THE
TIME
IF
I
HAD
MORE
HISTORY
I
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
ANSWER
YOU
BETTER
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
SEND
ME
EMAIL
WITH
MORE
INFORMATION
I
WOULD
BE
HAPPY
TO
TRY
TO
HELP
YOU
PIECE
TOGETHER
WHAT
MIGHT
HAVE
HAPPENED
