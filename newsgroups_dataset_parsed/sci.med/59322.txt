WRITES

THE
USE
OF
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTICS
GORDEN
RUBENFELD
THROUGH
EMAIL
HAS
ASSURED
ME
THAT
MOST
PHYSICIANS
RECOGNIZE
THE
CHANCE
OF
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
OCCURING
AFTER
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
AND
THEY
THEREFORE
REINNOCULATE
THEIR
PATIENTS
WITH
GOOD
BACTERIA
TO
RESTORE
COMPETETION
FOR
CANDIDA
IN
THE
BODY
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
YET
A
STANDARD
PART
OF
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
NOR
IS
IT
MINE
WHAT
I
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
TO
MARTY
WAS
THAT
IT
IS
CLEARLY
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
ANTIBIOTIC
EXPOSURE
IS
A
RISK
FACTOR
FOR
FUNGAL
INFECTIONS
WHICH
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
SAYING
BACTERIA
PREVENT
FUNGAL
INFECTIONS
MARTY
MADE
THIS
SOUND
LIKE
A

ONLY
TO

ANYONE

I
ALSO
USE

TO

THAT
MAY
BE
IN

DUE

IN

HOWEVER
IT
IS
NOT

OF
MY
ROUTINE

TO
REINNOCULATE

I
HAVE

NO

ADVISE
TO

MEDICINE
HAS
NOT

NEVER

THIS

THERE
HAS
ALWAYS

THE
USE

A
VERY
GOOD

IS
KIDNEY

CONVENTIONAL
WISDOMBECAUSE
CLINICAL

HAVE
NOT
BEEN

TO
COME
UP
WITH

WAS
THAT
RESTRICITNG
THE

OF

THE

WAY
TO
PREVENT
KIDNEY

NOW

INCREASING
CALCIUM
INTAKE

BETTER
AT

THAN
IS
RESTRICTING
CALCIUM

SEEMS

THIS
IS
AN

ARGUMENT
FOR
