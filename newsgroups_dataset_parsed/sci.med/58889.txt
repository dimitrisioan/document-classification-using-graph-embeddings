what
is
wrong
with
the
above
observation
is
that
it
explicitly
gives
the
impression
and
you
may
not
in
fact
hold
this
view
that
the
common
perhaps
even
the
correct
approach
for
a
scientist
to
follow
is
to
sit
around
having
flights
of
fancy
and
scheming
on
the
basis
of
his
jealousies
and
petty
hatreds
flights
of
fancy
and
other
irrational
approaches
are
common
the
crucial
thing
is
not
to
sit
around
just
having
fantasies
they
arent
of
any
use
unless
they
make
you
do
some
experiments
ive
known
a
lot
of
scientists
whose
fantasies
lead
them
on
to
creative
work
usually
they
wont
admit
out
loud
what
the
fantasy
was
prior
to
the
consumption
of
a
few
beers
the
danger
in
philosophizing
about
science
is
that
theory
and
generalization
can
end
up
being
far
removed
from
the
actual
daytoday
of
the
grunt
at
the
bench
yes
its
great
to
be
involved
in
a
process
were
i
can
walk
into
the
lab
after
a
heavy
night
of
dreaming
and
just
do
something
for
the
hell
of
it
as
long
as
my
advisor
doesnt
catch
me
which
is
easy
enough
to
do
but
stamping
out
such
behavior
seems
to
be
the
purpose
in
life
of
grant
review
committees
and
the
peer
review
process
in
general
in
todays
world
thats
what
determines
what
science
is
what
gets
funded
and
a
damn
good
thing
to
flights
of
fantasy
just
dont
have
much
chance
of
producing
anything
at
least
not
in
biomedical
research
the
surest
way
for
a
graduate
student
to
ruin
their
life
is
to
work
in
a
lab
where
the
boss
is
more
concerned
with
fleshing
out
hisher
fantasies
than
with
having
the
student
work
on
a
project
that
actually
has
a
good
chance
of
producing
some
results
mds
seem
to
be
particularly
prone
to
this
aberrant
behavior
simple
example
warren
jelinek
noticed
an
extremely
heavy
band
on
a
dna
electrophoresis
gel
of
human
alu
fragments
he
got
very
excited
hoping
that
hed
seen
some
essential
part
of
the
control
mechanism
for
eukaryotic
genes
this
fantasy
led
him
to
sequence
samples
of
the
band
and
carry
out
binding
assays
the
result
was
a
wellconserved
or
so
bp
sequence
that
occurs
about
times
in
the
human
genome
unfortunately
for
warrens
fantasy
it
turns
out
to
be
a
transposon
that
is
present
in
so
many
copies
because
it
replicates
itself
and
copies
itself
back
into
the
genome
on
the
other
hand
the
characteristics
of
transposons
were
much
elucidated
the
necessity
of
a
cellular
reverse
transcriptase
was
recognized
and
the
standard
method
of
recognizing
human
dna
was
created
other
species
have
different
sets
of
transposons
fortunately
for
me
warren
and
i
used
to
eat
dinner
at
tgi
fridays
all
the
time
i
have
to
agree
with
gary
merrills
response
to
this
ive
read
alot
of
the
alu
and
middle
repetitive
sequence
work
and
its
really
very
interesting
good
work
with
implications
for
many
fields
in
molecular
genetics
its
really
an
example
of
how
a
well
reasoned
project
turned
up
interesting
results
that
were
unexpected
