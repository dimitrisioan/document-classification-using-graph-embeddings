RICHARD
SILVER
IS
THERE
A
RIGHTEYE
DOMINANCE
EYEDNESS
AS
THERE
IS
AN
OVERALL
RIGHTHANDEDNESS
IN
THE
POPULATION
I
MEAN
DO
MOST
PEOPLE
REQUIRE
LESS
LENS
CORRECTIONS
FOR
THE
ONE
EYE
THAN
THE
OTHER
IF
SO
WHAT
KINDS
OF
PERCENTAGES
CAN
BE
ATTACHED
TO
THIS
THANKS
THERE
IS
AN
EYEDNESS
ANALOGOUS
TO
HANDEDNESS
BUT
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
REFRACTIVE
ERROR
TO
SEE
WHETHER
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
OR
LEFT
EYED
ROLL
UP
A
SHEET
OF
PAPER
INTO
A
TUBE
AND
HOLD
IT
UP
TO
EITHER
EYE
LIKE
A
TELESCOPE
THE
EYE
THAT
YOU
FEEL
MORE
COMFORTABLE
PUTTING
IT
UP
TO
IS
YOUR
DOMINANT
EYE
REFRACTIVE
ERROR
IS
OFTEN
DIFFERENT
IN
THE
TWO
EYES
BUT
HAS
NO
CORRELATION
WITH
HANDEDNESS

WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
MORE
COMFORTABLE
PUTTING
IT
UP
TO
THAT
SEEMS
A
BIT
HARD
TO
EVALUATE
AT
LEAST
FOR
ME
IT
IS
STARE
STRAIGHT
POINT
WITH
BOTH
HANDS
TOGETHER
AND
CLASP
SO
THAT
ONLY
THE
POINTER
FINGERS
ARE
POINTING
STRAIGHT
FORWARD
TO
A
A
SPOT
ON
THE
WALL
ABOUT
EIGHT
FEET
AWAY
FIRST
STARE
AT
THE
SPOT
WITH
BOTH
EYES
OPEN
NOW
CLOSE
YOUR
LEFT
EYE
NOW
OPEN
YOUR
LEFT
EYE
NOW
CLOSE
YOUR
RIGHT
EYE
NOW
OPEN
YOUR
RIGHT
EYE
IF
THE
IMAGE
JUMPED
MORE
WHEN
YOU
CLOSED
YOUR
RIGHT
EYE
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
EYE
DOMINANT
IF
THE
IMAGE
JUMPED
MORE
WHEN
YOU
CLOSED
YOUR
LEFT
EYE
YOU
ARE
LEFT
EYE
DOMINANT
