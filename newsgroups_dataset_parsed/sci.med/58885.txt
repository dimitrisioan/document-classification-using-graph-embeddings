MINGZHOU
LIU
WRITES
I
HAVE
BAD
LUCK
AND
GOT
A
VD
CALLED
GRANULOMA
INGUNALE
WHICH
INVOLVES
THE
GROWTH
OF
GRANULES
IN
THE
GROIN
I
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
IT
BY
CHECKING
MEDICINE
BOOKS
AND
I
FOUND
THE
PRESCRIPTIONS
MINGZHOU
LIUS
MAIN
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
HE
HAS
AN
INCOMPETENT
PHYSICIAN
HIMSELF
THIS
PHYSICIAN
HAS
DIAGNOSED
A
PROBLEM
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
PROBABLY
HAS
NEVER
SEEN
THE
DIAGNOSED
DISEASE
BEFORE
AND
HAS
NO
IDEA
OF
WHAT
KINDS
OF
PROBLEMS
CAN
PRESENT
SIMILAR
SYMPTOMS
THIS
PHYSICIAN
NOW
WANTS
TO
TREAT
HIS
FIRST
CASE
OF
THIS
DISEASE
WITHOUT
ANY
HELP
FROM
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
THE
BEST
THING
MINGZHOU
LIU
COULD
DO
IS
FIRE
HIS
CURRENT
PHYSICIAN
AND
SEEK
OUT
A
BETTER
ONE
RUSSELL
