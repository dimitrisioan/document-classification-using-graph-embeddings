I
DONT
KNOW
THE
FIRST
THING
ABOUT
YEAST
INFECTIONS
BUT
I
AM
A
SCIENTIST
NO
SCIENTIST
WOULD
TAKE
YOUR
STATEMENT
NO
CONVINCING
EMPIRICAL
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
TO
TELL
YOU
ANYTHING
EXCEPT
AN
ABSENCE
OF
DATA
ON
THE
QUESTION
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
RESTS
UPON
THOSE
WHO
CLAIM
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THIS
SYNDROME
TO
DATE
THESE
CLAIMS
ARE
UNSUBSTANTIATED
BY
ANY
AVAILABLE
DATA
HOPEFULLY
AS
A
SCIENTIST
YOU
WOULD
TAKE
ISSUE
WITH
ANYONE
OVERSTATING
THEIR
CONCLUSIONS
BASED
UPON
THEIR
DATA
BEASTIES
WITH
PRESENT
METHODS
EVEN
IF
THEY
WERE
THERE
NORING
AND
THE
FELLOW
FROM
OKLAHOMA
SORRY
FORGOT
YOUR
NAME
HAVE
ALSO
SUGGESTED
ONE
SET
OF
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
IN
FAVOR
BASED
ON
THEIR
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCES
NAMELY
THAT
WHEN
PEOPLE
WITH
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
ARE
GIVEN
ANTIFUNGALS
MANY
OF
THEM
APPEAR
TO
GET
BETTER
GEE
I
HAVE
MANY
INTERESTING
AND
ENLIGHTENING
ANECDOTES
ABOUT
MYSELF
MY
FRIENDS
AND
MY
FAMILY
BUT
IN
THE
PRACTICE
OF
MEDICINE
I
EXPECT
AND
DEMAND
MORE
RIGOROUS
RATIONALES
FOR
BASING
THERAPY
THAN
AUNT
SUSIES
BROTHERINLAW
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
MAY
PROVIDE
INSPIRATION
FOR
A
HYPOTHESIS
BUT
RARELY
PROVES
ANYTHING
IN
A
POSITIVE
SENSE
AND
UNLIKE
MATHEMATICS
BOOLEAN
LOGIC
RARELY
APPLIES
DIRECTLY
TO
MEDICAL
ISSUES
AND
SO
EVIDENCE
OF
EXCEPTIONS
DOES
NOT
USUALLY
DISPROVE
BUT
RATHER
MODIFIES
CURRENT
CONCEPTS
OF
DISEASE
SO
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
EVIDENCE
AGAINST
THE
HYPOTHESIS
FOR
EXAMPLE
CONTROLLED
DOUBLEBLIND
STUDIES
SHOWING
THAT
THE
ANTIFUNGALS
DONT
DO
ANY
BETTER
THAN
SUGAR
WATER
THEN
LETS
HEAR
IT
IF
YOU
DONT
THEN
WHAT
WE
HAVE
IS
ANECDOTAL
AND
UNCONTROLLED
EVIDENCE
ON
ONE
SIDE
AND
ABJECT
DISBELIEF
ON
THE
OTHER
IN
WHICH
CASE
PLEASE
THERE
IS
NO
POINT
IN
YELLING
BACK
AND
FORTH
AT
EACH
OTHER
ANY
LONGER
SINCE
NEITHER
SIDE
HAS
ANY
CONVINCING
EVIDENCE
EITHER
POSITIVE
OR
NEGATIVE
I
WOULD
CHARACTERIZE
IT
NOT
AS
ABJECT
DISBELIEF
BUT
RATHER
SCIENTIFIC
OUTRAGE
OVER
VASTLY
OVERSTATED
CONCLUSIONS
IT
APPEARS
TO
ME
THE
MAIN
QUESTION
NOW
IS
WHETHER
THE
PROPONENTS
CAN
MARSHALL
ENOUGH
ANECDOTAL
EVIDENCE
IN
A
CONVINCING
AND
DOCUMENTED
ENOUGH
MANNER
TO
MAKE
A
GOOD
CASE
FOR
CARRYING
OUT
A
GOOD
CONTROLLED
DOUBLEBLIND
STUDY
OF
ANTIFUNGALS
OR
ELSE
FORGET
CONVINCING
ANYBODY
ELSE
TO
CARRY
OUT
THE
TEST
JUST
CARRY
IT
OUT
THEMSELVES
AND
ALSO
WHETHER
THEY
CAN
ADEQUATELY
DEFINE
THE
PATIENT
POPULATION
OR
SYMPTOMS
ON
WHICH
SUCH
A
STUDY
SHOULD
BE
CARRIED
OUT
TO
PROVIDE
A
FAIR
TEST
OF
THE
HYPOTHESIS
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
SUCH
AN
APPROACH
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
IN
THE
TRENCHES
OF
THIS
DIAGNOSIS
