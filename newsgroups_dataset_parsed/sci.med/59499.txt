RE
CHROMIUM
AS
DIETARY
SUPPLIMENT
FOR

LOSS
IN
ARTICLE
HENRY
MELTON
WRITES
MY
WIFE
HAS
REQUESTED
THAT
I
POLL
THE
SAGES
OF
USENET
TO
SEE
WHAT
IS
KNOWN
ABOUT
THE
USE
OF
CHROMIUM
IN
WEIGHTCONTROL
DIET
SUPPLIMENTS
SHE
HAS
SEEN
MULTIPLE
PRODUCTS
ADVERTISING
IT
AND
WOULD
LIKE
ANY
KIND
REAL
INFORMATION
MY
FIRST
IMPULSE
WAS
YUCK
A
METAL
BUT
I
HAVE
ZERO
DATA
ON
IT
WHAT
DO
YOU
KNOW
HENRY
MELTON
ILL
TELL
YOU
ALL
THAT
I
KNOW
ABOUT
CHROMIUM
BUT
BEFORE
I
DO
I
WANT
TO
GET
A
FEW
THINGS
OFF
MY
CHEST
I
JUST
GOT
BLASTED
IN
EMAIL
FOR
MY
KIDNEY
STONE
POSTS
KIDNEY
STONES
ARE
PRIMARILY
CAUSED
BY
DIET
AS
IS
HEART
DISEASE
AND
CANCER
WHEN
I
GIVE
DIETARY
ADVISE
IT
IS
NOT
INTENDED
TO
ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE
READING
THIS
NEWS
GROUPOR
SCI
MED
NUTRITION
WHERE
I
DO
MOST
OF
MY
POSTING
TO
AVOID
SEEING
A
DOCTOR
NOTHING
CAN
BE
FURTHER
FROM
THE
TRUTH
KIDNEY
STONES
CAN
BE
CAUSED
BY
TUMORS
AND
THIS
POSSIBILITY
HAS
TO
BE
RULED
OUT
BUT
ONCE
IT
IS
DIET
IS
A
GOOD
WAY
OF
PREVENTING
A
REOCCURANCE
SAME
THING
WITH
HEART
DISEASE
AND
CANCER
IF
YOU
SUSPECT
THAT
YOU
MAY
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
ONE
OF
THESE
DISEASES
DONT
USE
WHAT
IM
GOING
TO
TELL
YOU
OR
WHAT
YOU
READ
IN
SOME
BOOK
TO
AVOID
GOING
TO
A
DOCTOR
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
HOPEFULLY
YOU
WILL
FIND
A
DOCTOR
WHO
KNOWS
ENOUGH
ABOUT
NUTRITION
TO
HELP
YOU
CHANGE
YOUR
RISK
FACTORS
FOR
BOTH
DISEASES
AS
PART
OF
A
TREATMENT
PROGRAMBUT
THE
ODDS
ARE
THAT
YOU
WILL
NOT
AND
THATS
WHY
IM
HERE
WHEN
MY
WIFE
DETECTED
A
LUMP
IN
HERE
BREAST
I
DIDNT
SAY
DONT
WORRY
MY
VITAMIN
E
WILL
TAKE
CARE
OF
IT
ANY
BREAST
LUMP
HAS
TO
BE
WORKED
UP
BY
A
PHYSICIAN
PLAN
AND
SIMPLE
IF
ITS
BEGNINWHICH
MOST
ARE
FINE
THEN
MAYBE
A
DIET
CHANGE
AND
SUPPLEMENTATION
WILL
PREVENT
FURTHER
BREAST
LUMPS
FROM
OCCURING
BUT
LET
ME
TELL
YOU
RIGHT
NOW
IF
YOU
HAVE
TRIED
DIET
AND
SUPPLEMENTATION
AND
ANOTHER
LUMP
RETURNS
GET
YOUR
BUTT
INTO
THE
DOCTORS
OFFICE
AS
FAST
AS
YOUR
LITTLE
FEET
CAN
CARRY
YOUBETTER
YET
HAVE
A
MAMMOGRAPHY
DONE
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
MY
WIFE
KEPT
PUTTING
HERS
OFF
BOTH
MYSELF
AND
HER
GYNOCOLOGIST
TOLD
HER
SHE
NEEDED
TO
HAVE
ONE
DONE
HER
GYNOCOLOGIST
EVEN
SCHEDULED
ONE
BUT
SHE
DIDNT
SHOW
UPTOO
BUSY
RUNNING
THE
OPERATING
ROOM
FOR
THE
BIGGEST
HOSPITAL
IN
TULSA
ONE
MORE
THING
I
AM
NOT
AN
ORTHOMOLECULAR
NUTRITIONIST
THIS
GROUP
USES
HIGH
DOSE
VITAMINS
AND
MINERALS
TO
TREAT
ALL
KINDS
OF
DISEASE
THERE
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
DOUBT
IN
MY
MIND
THAT
VITAMINS
AND
MINERALS
CAN
AND
DO
HAVE
DRUG
ACTIONS
IN
THE
BODY
BUT
YOU
TALK
ABOUT
FLYING
BLIND
MAN
THIS
IS
REALLY
BLIND
TREATMENT
NO
DRUG
COULD
EVER
BE
USED
AS
THESE
VITAMINS
AND
MINERALS
ARE
BEING
USED
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
SOME
OF
THIS
STUFF
COULDNT
BE
RIGHT
ON
THE
MONEY
IT
MAY
WELL
BE
BUT
MY
APPROACH
TO
NUTRITION
IS
A
LOT
LIKE
THAT
OF
WEINSIER
AND
MORGAN
THE
TWO
MDS
WHO
WROTE
THE
NEW
CLINICAL
NUTRITION
TEXTBOOK
MY
PUSH
IS
THE
NUTRIENT
RESERVES
AND
THE
LAB
TESTS
NEEDED
TO
MEASURE
THESE
RESERVES
AND
THEN
SUPPLEMENTATION
OR
DIET
CHANGES
TO
GET
THESE
RESERVES
BUILT
UP
TO
WHERE
THEY
SHOULD
BE
TO
LET
YOU
HANDLE
STRESS
THATS
WHERE
IM
COMING
FROM
FOLKS
BLAST
AWAY
IF
YOU
WANT
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
CHANGE
PUT
ME
IN
YOUR
KILLFILE
IF
YOU
WANT
I
REALLY
DONT
CARE
IM
AVERAGING
EMAIL
MESSAGES
A
DAY
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
THINK
THAT
IVE
GOT
SOMETHING
IMPORTANT
TO
SAY
BUT
IM
ALSO
GETTING
HIT
BY
A
FEW
WITH
AN
AXE
TO
GRIND
THATS
LIFE
CHROMIUM
IS
ONE
OF
THE
TRACE
ELEMENTS
IT
HAS
A
VERY
LIMITEDBUT
VERY
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
THE
BODY
IT
IS
USED
TO
FORM
GLUCOSE
TOLERANCE
FACTOR
GTF
GTF
IS
MADE
UP
OF
CHROMIUM
NICINAMIDENIACIN
GLYCINE
CYSTEINE
AND

ONLY
THE
CHROMIUM
AND
THE
NIACIN
ARE
NEEDED
FROM
THE
DIET
TO

GTF
SOME
FOODS
ALREADY
HAVE
GTFLIVER
BREWERS
OR
NUTRITIONAL
YEAST
AND
BLACK
PEPPER
WHEN
CHROMIUM
IS
IN
GTF
A
PRETTY
GOOD
ABSORPTION
IS
SEENABOUT
BUT
WHEN
IT
IS
SIMPLY
PRESENT
AS
A
MINERAL
OR
MINERAL
CHELATECHROMIUM
PICOLINATE
ITS
ABSORPTION
IS
MUCH
TO
LOWEST
FOR
ALL
THE
MINERALS
IVE
BEEN
POSTING
IN
MISC
FITNESS
AND
CHROMIUM
HAS
COME
UP
THERE
SEVERAL
TIMES
AS
A
FAT
BURNER
CHROMIUM
IS
AMONG
THE
LEAST
TOXIC
OF
THE
MINERALS
SO
YOU
COULD
REALLY
LOAD
YOURSELF
UP
AND
NOT
REALLY
DO
ANY
HARM
I
WOULDNT
DO
IT
THOUGH
THE
ADEQUATE
AND
SAFE
RANGE
FOR
CHROMIUM
IS
TO
PER
DAY
THE
AVERAGE
AMERICAN
IS
GETTING
ABOUT
PER
DAY
FROM
HISHER
DIET
CHROMIUM
LEVELS
DECREASE
WITH
AGE
AND
MANY
BELIEVE
THAT
ADULT
ONSET
DIABETES
IS
PRIMARILY
A
CHROMIUM
DEFICIENCY
I
CAN
CITE
YOU
SEVERAL
STUDIES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
WITH
GLUCOSE
TOLERANCE
IN
TYPE
II
DIABETES
BUT
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
BECAUSE
FOR
EACH
POSITIVE
ONE
THERE
ALSO
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
NEGATIVE
ONE
AS
WELL
IM
CONVINCED
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
BIOAVAILABILITY
WHEN
YEASTGTF
IS
USED
GOOD
RESULTS
ARE
OBTAINED
BUT
WHEN
CHROMIUM
ITSELF
IS
USED
THE
RESULTS
ARE
USUALLY
NEGATIVE
IN
ADDITION
TO
TYPE
II
DIABETES
CHROMIUUM
HAS
BEEN
EXAMINED
IN
CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASE
AND
GLUCOMA
AGAIN
WITH
MIXED
RESULTS
AS
FAR
AS
CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASE
IS
CONCERNED
SINCE
A
HIGH
BLOOD
GLUCOSE
LEVEL
CAN
LEAD
TO
CARDIOVASCULAR
DISEASE
THIS
POSSIBLE
LINK
WITH
CHROMIUM
ISNT
TOO
SURPRISING
GLUCOMA
IS
A
LITTLE
MORE
INTERESTING
MUSCLE

FOCUSING

IS
PRIMARILY
AN

RESPONSIVE
GLUCOSEDRIVEN
METABOLIC
FUNCTION
IF
THIS
EYE
FOCUSING
ACTIVITY
IS
IMPAIREDBY
A
LACK
OF
GLUCOSE
DUE
TO
A
POOR
INSULIN
RESPONSE
INTRAOCULAR

IS
BELIEVED
TO
BE
ELEVATED
IN
A
FAIRLY

OF

THE

BUT
THIS
ONE
PRELIMINARY
STUDY
SHOULD
NOT

PEOPLE
TO
GO
OUT
AND
START
POPPING
CHROMIUM
SUPPLEMENTS
FOR
ONE
THING
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
OLDER
PERSON
IS
GOING
TO
HAVE
A
LOW
RBC
CHROMIUM
UNLESS
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
TAKING
CHROMIUM
SUPPLEEMNTSYEAST
SINCE
GLUCOMA
IS
OFTEN
FOUND
IN
OLDER
PEOPLE
ITS
NOT
TOO
SURPRISING
THAT
CHROMIUM
WAS
LOW
IN
THE
RBCS
IF
CHROMIUM
SUPPLEMENTATION
COULD
REVERSE
GLUCOMA
THAT
WOULD
PROMPT
SOME
ATTENTION
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
A
CLINICAL
TRAIL
TO
CHECK
OUT
THIS
POSSIBLE
CHROMIUM
LINK
TO
GLUCOMA
YOU
COULD
FIND
OUT
WHAT
YOUR
BODY
CHROMIUM
POOL
SIZE
WAS
BY
EITHER
THE
RBC
CHROMIUM
TEST
OR
HAIR
ANALYSIS
MOST
CLINICAL
LABS
ARE
NOT
GOING
TO
RUN
A
RBC
CHROMIUM
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
LABS
THAT
WILL
DO
A
HAIR
AND
NAIL
ANALYSIS
FOR
YOU
BUT
I
WOULDNT
USE
THEM
THERE
IS
JUST
TOO
MUCH
FUNNY
BUSINESS
GOING
ON
IN
THESE
UNREGULATED
LABS
RIGHT
NOW
HERES
WEINSIER
AND
MORGAN
ADVISE
ON
CHROMIUM
THEY
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
CHROMIUM
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THOSE
MINERALS
FOR
WHICH
A
RELIABLE
CLINICAL
TEST
IS
AVAILABLETHEY
DONT
LIKE
THE
HAIR
AND
NAIL
ANALYSIS
LABS
EITHER
AND
THEY
ALSO
RECOGNIZE
THE
RBC
CHROMIUM
IS
PRIMARILY
A
RESEARCH
TEST
THAT
IS
NOT
ROUTINELY
AVAILABLE
IN
MOST
CLINICAL
CHEMISTRY
LABS
THIS
HAS
TO
CHANGE
AND
AS
MORE
LABS
RUN
A
RBC
CHROMIUUM
IT
WILL
WHAT
THEN
DO
THEY
SUGGEST
MAKE
A
DIAGNOSIS
OF
CHROMIUM
DEFICIENCY
BASED
ON
A
DOCUMENTED
CLINICAL
RESPONSE
TO
CHROMIUMRUN
A
GLUCOSE
TOLERANCE
TEST
BEFORE
AND
AFTER
CHROMIUM
SUPPLEMENTATION
ONCE
YOU
MAKE
THE
DIAGNOSIS
PUT
THE
PATIENT
ON
OF
ORALLY
EACH
DAY
OR
OF
YEAST
PER
DAY
WHATS
MY
ADVISE
DONT
TAKE
CHROMIUM
SUPPLEMENTS
TO
TRY
TO
LOOSE
WEIGHT
THEY
JUST
DO
NOT
WORK
THAT
WAY
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
TAKE
THEM
AND
THEN
EXERCISE
THAT
WOULD
BE
GREAT
DO
INCLUDE
YEAST
AS
PART
OF
YOUR
DIETMOST
AMERICANS
ARE
NOT
GETTING
ENOUGH
CHROMIUM
FROM
THEIR
DIET
IF
YOU
DO
HAVE
A
POOR
GLUCOSE
TOLERANCE
ASK
YOUR
DOCTOR
TO
CHECK
YOUR
CHROMIUM
STATUS
WHEN
HE
OR
SHE
SAYS
WHAT
IN
THE
WORLD
ARE
YOU
TALKING
ABOUT
JUST
SAY
PLEASE
GET
A
COPY
OF
WEINSIER
AND

NUTRITION
TEXTBOOK
AND
DO
WHAT
THEY
SAY
TO
DO
WITH
PATIENTS
WHO

WITH

TOLERANCE
IF
YOU
CANT
DO
THAT
ILL
