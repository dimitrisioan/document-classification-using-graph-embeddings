RE
IS
MSG
SENSITIVITY
SUPERSTITION
AS
NOBODY
IN
THE
FOOD
INDUSTRY
HAS
EVEN
BOTHERED
TO
ADDRESS
MY
PREVIOUS
QUESTION
WHY
DO
YOU
NEED
TO
PUT
MSG
IN
ALMOST
EVERY
FOOD
I
MUST
ASSUME
THAT
MY
WIFES
ANSWER
IS
CLOSER
TO
THE
TRUTH
THAN
I
HOPED
IT
WAS
SHE
BELIEVES
THAT
MSG
IS
ADDED
TO
FOOD
TO
CAUSE
PEOPLE
TO
EAT
MORE
OF
IT
AND
NOT
QUIT
WHEN
THEY
SHOUD
BE
SATED
TO
PUT
IT
A
DIFFERENT
WAY
SHE
BELIEVES
THAT
FOR
SOME
PEOPLE
MSG
CAUSES
THEM
TO
ACT
TOWARD
FOOD
LIKE
AN
ADDICT
EAT
ALL
THE
CHIPS
CHOW
DOWN
ON
SEVERAL
PACKAGES
OF
NOODLE
SOUP
YOU
GET
THE
IDEA
IF
SHE
IS
RIGHT
THEN
THE
MORAL
AND
ETHICAL
STANDARDS
OF
THE
FOOD
CHEMICAL
AND
REGULATORY
GROUPS
NEED
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
CAN
MSG
BE
CONSIDERED
A
CONDITIONING
SUBSTANCE
NOT
ADDICTIVE
BUT
SORT
OF
HABIT
FORMING
THIS
BRINGS
UP
A
SIDE
QUESTION
OF
MINE
I
HAVE
NOTICED
THAT
CATS
MY
CHILDRENS
AND
MY
PARENTS
SEEM
TO
FIXATE
ON
A
PARTICULAR
BRAND
OF
PET
FOOD
THE
CAT
WILL
EAT
ANY
PRODUCT
WITHIN
ONE
BRAND
AND
NOT
ANY
OTHER
BRAND
I
HAVE
WONDERED
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
A
CASE
OF
PREFERENCE
BUT
SOME
SORT
OF
CHEMICAL
TRAINING
OR
ADDICTION
MY
QUESTIONS
FOR
THE
NET
ARE
DOES
THE
FDA
REGULATE
THE
CONTENTS
OF
PET
FOOD
IS
IT
ALLOWED
FOR
PET
FOOD
TO
CONTAIN
ADDICTIVE
OR
CONDITIONING
SUBSTANCES
IS
MSG
PUT
IN
PET
FOOD
I
SPEAK
FOR
MYSELF
AND
NOT
