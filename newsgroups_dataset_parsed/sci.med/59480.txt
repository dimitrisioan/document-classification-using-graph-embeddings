MED
SCHOOL
ACTUALLY
I
AM
ENTERING
VET
SCHOOL
NEXT
YEAR
BUT
THE
QUESTION
IS
RELEVANT
FOR
MED
STUDENTS
TOO
MEMORIZING
LARGE
AMOUNTS
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
MY
STRONG
POINT
ACADEMICALLY
SINCE
THIS
IS
A
MAJOR
PORTION
OF
MEDICAL
EDUCATION
ANATOMY
HISTOLOGY
PATHOLOGY
PHARMACOLOGY
ARE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
MASS
MEMORIZATION
I
AM
A
LITTLE
CONCERNED
AS
I
AM
SURE
MOST
MED
STUDENTS
ARE
CAN
ANYONE
SUGGEST
TECHNIQUES
FOR
THIS
TYPE
OF
MEMORIZATION
I
HAVE
HAD
REASONABLE
SUCCESS
WITH
NEMONICS
AND
MEMORY
TRICKS
LIKE
THINKING
UP
LITTLE
STORIES
TO
ASSOCIATE
UNRELATED
THINGS
BUT
I
HAVE
NEVER
APPLIED
THEM
TO
LARGE
AMOUNTS
OF
DATA
HAS
ANYONE
HAD
LUCK
WITH
ANY
PARTICULAR
BOOKS
MEMORY
SYSTEMS
OR
CHEAP
SOFTWARE
CAN
YOU
SUGGEST
ANY
HELPFUL
ORGANIZATIONAL
TECHNIQUES
BEING
AN
OLDER
STUDENT
WHO
RETURNED
TO
SCHOOL
THIS
YEAR
ORGANIZATION
ANOTHER
ONE
OF
MY
WEAK
POINTS
HAS
BEEN
A
MAJOR
HELP
TO
MY
SUCCESS
PLEASE
NO
GRIPING
ABOUT
HOW
ALL
YOU
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
LEARN
THE
MATERIAL
CONCEPTUALLY
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THAT
IT
IS
ONE
OF
MY
STRONG
POINTS
BUT
YOU
CANT
GET
AROUND
THE
FACT
THAT
MUCH
OF
MEDICINE
IS
ROTE
MEMORIZATION
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
HELP
