WRITES
THERE
WAS
A
STORY
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
ON
A
NETWORK
NEWS
SHOW
ABOUT
SOME
SORT
OF
FUNGUS
WHICH
SUPPOSEDLY
ATTACKS
THE
BONE
STRUCTURE
AND
IS
SOMEWHAT
WIDESPREAD
IN
CALIFORNIA
ANYBODY
HEAR
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THIS
ONE
THE
ONLY
FUNGUS
I
KNOW
OF
FROM
CALIFORNIA
IS
COCCIDIOMYCOSIS
I
HADNT
HEARD
THAT
IT
ATTACKED
BONE
IT
ATTACKS
LUNG
AND
IF
YOU
ARE
ESPECIALLY
UNLUCKY
THE
CENTRAL
NERVOUS
SYSTEM
NOTHING
NEW
ABOUT
IT
ITS
BEEN
AROUND
FOR
YEARS
THEY
CALL
IT
VALLEY
FEVER
SINCE
IT
IS
FOUND
IN
THE
INLAND
VALLEYS
NOT
ON
THE
COAST
THERE
IS
A
MINIEPIDEMIC
OF
COCCIDIODES
THAT
IS
OCCURRING
IN
I
BELIEVE
THE
OWENS
VALLEY
BISHOP
AREA
EAST
OF
THE
SIERRAS
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THERE
HAS
BEEN
ANY
GREAT
INSIGHT
INTO
THE
INCREASED
INCIDENCE
IN
THAT
AREA
THERE
IS
A
LOWLEVEL
OF
ENDEMIC
INFECTION
IN
THAT
REGION
MANY
PEOPLE
WITH
EVIDENCE
OF
PAST
EXPOSURE
TO
THE
ORGANISM
DID
NOT
HAVE
SERIOUS
DISEASE
