IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
DOCTORS
SAID
THAT
HE
COULD
DIE
FROM
IT
AND
THE
MEDICATION
CAUSED
IS
IT
THAT
SERIOUS
MY
EKG
OFTEN
COMES
BACK
WITH
A
FEW
IRREGULAR
BEATS
ANOTHER
QUESTION
IS
A
LOW
BLOOD
POTASSIUM
LEVEL
VERY
BAD
MY
DOCTOR
SEEMS
CONCERNED
BUT
SHE
TENDS
TO
WORRY
TOO
MUCH
IN
GENERAL
THE
TERM
ARRHYTHMIA
IS
USUALLY
USED
TO
ENCOMPASS
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
ABNORMAL
HEART
RHYTHMS
CARDIAC
DYSRHYTHMIAS
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
VERY
SERIOUS
WHILE
OTHERS
ARE
COMPLETELY
BENIGN
HAVING
A
FEW
IRREGULAR
BEATS
ON
AN
EKG
COULD
BE
SERIOUS
DEPENDING
ON
WHAT
THOSE
BEATS
WERE
AND
WHEN
THEY
OCCURRED
OR
COULD
BE
OF
NO
SIGNIFICANCE
LOW
BLOOD
POTASSIUM
LEVELS
PROBABLY
PREDISPOSE
PEOPLE
WITH
UNDERLYING
HEART
DISEASE
TO
DEVELOP
ARRHYTHMIAS
VERY
LOW
POTASSIUM
LEVELS
ARE
CLEARLY
DANGEROUS
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
HOW
MUCH
OF
A
PROBLEM
LOWENDOFNORMAL
LEVELS
ARE
A
LOT
OF
CARDIOLOGISTS
SEEM
TO
TREAT
ANYONE
WITH
EVEN
A
MILDLY
LOWNORMAL
POTASSIUM
LEVEL
