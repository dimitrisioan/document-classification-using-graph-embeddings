YOUNG
MAN
WITH
INGUIANL
HERNIA
ON
ONE
SIDE
REPAIRED
NOW
HAS
NEW
HERNIA
ON
OTHER
SIDE
WHAT
GIVES
HE
ASKS
AND
HE
CONTINUES
OF
COURSE
MY
WIFE
THINKS
ITS
FROM
SITTING
FOR
LONG
PERIODS
OF
TIME
AT
THE
COMPUTER
READING
NEWS
THERE
IS
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
DEGREE
OF
CONSTIPATION
CAUSING
CHRONIC
STRAINING
WHICH
HAS
CAUSED
THE
BOWEL
MOVEMENTS
THE
CLASSIC
PROBLEMS
THAT
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
LOOKED
FOR
IN
SOMEONE
WITH
A
HERNIA
ARE
CONSTIPATION
CHRONIC
COUGH
COLON
CANCER
AND
YOURE
NOT
TOO
YOUNG
FOR
THAT
AND
SITTING
FOR
LONG
PERIODS
OF

AT
THE

GOOD
LUCK

YOUR
SURGERY
STEVE
HOLLAND
WELL
THAT
POST
WAS
NOT
THAT
ACCURATE
PEOPLE
WITH
EARLY
LIFE
HERNIAS
ARE
FELT
TO
HAVE
A
CONGENITAL
SACK
THAT
PROMOTES
THE
FORMATION
OF
HERNIAS
THE
HERNIAS
OF
LATER
LIFE
MAY
BE
MORE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CHRONIC
STRAINING
HOWEVER
THE
RISK
OF
DAMAGE
TO
THE
INTESTINE
WITHOUT
AN
OPERATION
IS
HIGH
ENOUGH
THAT
IT
OUGHT
TO
BE
REPAIRED
THE
RISK
OF
CANCER
IS
PROBABLY
NO
HIGHER
THAN
THE
GENERAL
POPULATION
BUT
SINCE
YOU
ARE
NEAR
IT
WOULD
BE
SENSIBLE
TO
HAVE
SOME
SORT
OF
CANCER
SCREENING
SUCH
AS
A
FLEXIBLE
SIGMOIDOSCOPY
SORRY
FOR
THE
MISLEADING
INFO
