a
disease
about
which
i

apparently
it

bodys
production
of

same
time
being
highly
allergic
to
yeast

receives
the
blessing
of
medical
study
researchers
have
found
that
eating
a
cup
of
yogurt
a
day
drastically
reduces
a
womans
chances
of
getting
vaginal
candida
a
yeast
infection
for
the
yearlong
study
researchers
at
long
island
jewish
medical
center
in
new
hyde
park
new
york
recruited
women
who
suffered
from
chronic
yeast
infections
for
the
first
months
the
women
each
day
ate
ounces
of
yogurt
containing
lactobacillus
acidophilus
for
the
second
months
the
women
did
not
eat
yogurt
the
researchers
examined
the
women
each
month
and
found
that
incidents
of
colonization
and
infection
were
significantly
lower
during
the
period
when
the
women
ate
yogurt
the
fungus
candida
albicans
can
live
in
the
body
without
doing
harm
it
is
an
overproliferation
of
the
fungus
that
leads
to
infection
the
researchers
concluded
that
the
l
acidophilus
bacteria
found
in
some
brands
of
yogurt
retard
overgrowth
of
the
fungus
streptococcus
thermophilus
and
l
bulgaricus
are
the
two
bacteria
most
commonly
used
in
commercial
yogurt
production
neither
one
appears
to
exert
a
protective
effect
against
candida
albicans
however
women
who
want
to
try
yogurt
as
a
preventive
measure
should
choose
a
brand
that
lists
acidophilus
in
its
contents

candida
monilia
this
disease
is
usually
caused
by
candida
albicans
a
fungus
that
we
all
carry
at
one
time
or
another
in
some
circumstances
though
the
organisms
proliferate
producing
symptomatic
infection
of
the
mouth
intestines
vagina
or
skin
when
the
mouth
or
vagina
are
infected
the
disease
is
commonly
called
thrush
vaginitis
caused
by
candida
often
afflicts
women
on
birth
control
pills
or
antibiotics
there
is
itching
and
a
white
cheesy
discharge
among
narcotic
addicts
candida
infections
can
lead
to
heart
valve
inflammation
diagnosis
of
candida
infections
is
confirmed
by
cultures
and
blood
tests
treatment
can
be
with
amphotericin
b
or
orally
with
ketoconazole
there
is
no
evidence
that
candida
in
the
intestine
of
normal
individuals
leads
to
disease
all
people
at
one
time
or
another
have
candida
in
their
intestines
claims
for
any
benefit
from
special
diets
or
chronic
antifungal
agents
is
not
based
on
any
solid
