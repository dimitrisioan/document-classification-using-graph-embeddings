CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
IS
USUALLY
DIAGNOSED
WHEN
SOMEONE
DOES
A
LIVER
BIOPSY
ON
A
PATIENT
THAT
HAS
PERSISTENTLY
ELEVATED
SERUM
TRANSAMINASES
MONTHS
AFTER
A
BOUT
OF
ACUTE
VIRAL
HEPATITIS
OR
WHEN
SOMEONE
IS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
PERSISTENTLY
ELEVATED
TRANSAMINASES
ON
ROUTINE
SCREENING
TESTS
THE
DEGREE
OF
ELEVATION
IN
THE
SERUM
TRANSAMINASES
CAN
BE
TRIVIAL
OR
AS
MUCH
AS
TEN
TIMES
NORMAL
OTHER
BLOOD
CHEMISTRIES
ARE
USUALLY
NORMAL
AS
A
RULE
PATIENTS
WITH
CPH
HAVE
NO
CLINICAL
SIGNS
OF
LIVER
DISEASE
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
CAN
ALSO
BE
ASYMPTOMATIC
OR
MINIMALLY
SYMPTOMATIC
AT
LEAST
INITIALLY
AND
THATS
WHY
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
TELL
THEM
APART
BY
MEANS
OF
A
BIOPSY
THE
PATIENT
WITH
CPH
ONLY
NEEDS
TO
BE
REASSURED
THE
PATIENT
WITH
CAH
NEEDS
TO
BE
TREATED
I
JUST
WENT
BACK
TO
THE
CHAPTER
IN
CECIL
ON
CHRONIC
HEPATITIS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
INDEED
MOST
CASES
OF
CPH
ARE
PERSISTANT
VIRAL
HEPATITIS
WHEREAS
THERE
ARE
A
MULTITUDE
OF
POTENTIAL
AND
PROBABLE
CAUSES
FOR
CAH
VIRAL
DRUGS
ALCOHOL
AUTOIMMUNE
ETC
PHYSICIANS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
VARIETY
OF
THRESHOLDS
FOR
ELECTING
TO
BIOPSY
SOMEONES
LIVER
PERSONALLY
I
THINK
THAT
IF
THE
PATIENT
IS
ASYMPTOMATIC
WITH
ONLY
SLIGHT
TRANSAMINITIS
AND
NORMAL
ALBUMIN
AND
PT
ONE
CAN
SIMPLY
FOLLOW
THEM
CLOSELY
AND
NOT
ADD
THE
POTENTIAL
RISKS
OF
A
BIOPSY
OTHERS
MAY
WELL
BIOPSY
SUCH
A
PATIENT
THUS
PROVIDING
THESE
SAMPLES
FOR
STUDY
IT
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
IF
