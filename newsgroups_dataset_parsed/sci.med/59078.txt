WRITES
FELL
ABOUT
WEEKS
AGO
DOWN
INTO
THE
HOLD
OF
THE
BOAT
AND
BROKE
OR
CRACKED
A
RIB
AND
WRENCHED
AND
BRUISED
MY
BACK
AND
LEFT
ARM
MY
QUESTION
I
HAVE
BEEN
TO
A
DOCTOR
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
WAS
BEST
TO
DO
NOTHING
AND
IT
WOULD
HEAL
UP
WITH
NO
LONG
TERM
EFFECT
AND
INDEED
I
AM
ABOUT
BETTER
HOWEVER
THE
WORK
I
DO
IS
VERY
HARD
AND
I
AM
STILL
NOT
ABLE
TO
GO
BACK
TO
WORK
THE
THING
THAT
WORRIES
ME
IS
THE
MOVEMENT
OR
CLUNKING
I
FEEL
AND
HEAR
BACK
THERE
WHEN
I
MOVE
CERTAIN
WAYS
I
HEARD
SOME
ONE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
RIB
THEY
BROKE
YEARS
AGO
AND
THAT
IT
STILL
BOTHERS
THEM
ANY
OPINIONS
YOUR
DOCTOR
IS
RIGHT
IT
IS
BEST
TO
DO
NOTHING
BESIDES
TAKING
SOME
PAIN
MEDICATION
INITIALLY
SOME
PATIENTS
DONT
LIKE
THIS
AND
EXPECT
OR
DEMAND
TO
HAVE
SOMETHING
DONE
IN
THESE
CASES
SOME
PHYSICIANS
WILL
TAPE
THE
PATIENT
PUT
A
LOT
OF
HEAVY
ADHESIVE
TAPE
AROUND
THE
CHEST
OR
PRESCRIBE
AN
ELASTIC
BINDER
ALL
THIS
DOES
IS
MAKE
IT
HARDER
TO
BREATH
BUT
THE
PATIENT
DOESNT
FEEL
CHEATED
BECAUSE
SOEMTHING
IS
BEING
DONE
ABOUT
THE
PROBLEM
EITHER
WAY
THE
END
RESULTS
ARE
THE
SAME
