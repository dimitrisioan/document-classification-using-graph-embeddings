heard
thirdhand
not
the
best
form
of
information
that
there
was
recently
published
results
of
a
study
on
multiplepersonalitydisorder
syndrome
patients
revealing
some
interesting
clues
that
the
root
cause
of
allergy
may
have
a
psychological
trigger
or
basis
what
i
heard
about
this
study
was
that
in
one
personality
a
mpds
patient
exhibited
no
observable
or
clinical
signs
of
inhalant
allergy
scratch
tests
were
used
according
to
what
i
heard
while
in
other
personalities
they
showed
obvious
allergy
symptoms
including
testing
a
full
on
scratch
tests
for
particular
inhalants
if
this
is
true
it
is
truly
fascinating
but
id
like
to
know
if
this
study
was
ever
done
and
if
so
what
the
study
really
showed
and
where
the
study
is
published
