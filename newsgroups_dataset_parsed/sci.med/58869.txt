SEIZURES
SP
FROM
SHARON
PAULSON
SP
TO
DESCRIBE
HERE
I
HAVE
A
FOURTEEN
YEAR
OLD
DAUGTER
WHO
EXPERIENCED
SP
A
SEIZURE
ON
NOVEMBER
AT
AFTER
EATING
KELLOGS
FROSTED
SP
FLAKES
SP
WELL
WE
WERE
GOING
ALONG
FINE
AND
THE
OTHER
MORNING
APRIL
SHE
HAD
SP
A
BOWL
OF
ANOTHER
KELLOGS
FROSTED
KIND
OF
CEREAL
FRUIT
LOOPS
I
AM
SP
WHEN
I
MENTIONED
WHAT
SHE
ATE
THE
FIRST
TIME
AS
A
POSSIBLE
REASON
FOR
SP
THE
SEIZURE
THE
NEUROLOGIST
BASICALLY
NEGATED
THAT
AS
AN
IDEA
NOW
SP
AFTER
THIS
SECOND
EPISODE
SO
SIMILAR
IN
NATURE
TO
THE
FIRST
EVEN
SP
HE
IS
SCRATCHING
HIS
HEAD
THERES
NO
DATA
THAT
SUGARCOATED
CEREALS
CAUSE
SEIZURES
I
HAVENT
EVEN
SEEN
ANYTHING
ANECDOTAL
ON
IT
GIVEN
HOW
COMMON
THEY
ARE
EATEN
DO
YOU
KNOW
ANY
CHILD
OR
ADOLESCENT
WHO
DOESNT
EAT
THE
STUFF
I
THINK
THAT
IF
THERE
WERE
A
RELATIONSHIP
WE
WOULD
KNOW
IT
BY
NOW
ALSO
THERES
NOTHING
WEIRD
IN
THOSE
CEREALS
AS
FAR
AS
THE
BRAIN
IS
CONCERNED
EXCEPT
FOR
A
FEW
INFANTILE
METABOLIC
DISORDERS
SUCH
AS
GALACTOSEMIA
SUGAR
IS
SUGAR
REGARDLESS
IF
IT
IS
COATED
ON
CEREAL
SPRINKLED
ONTO
CEREAL
OR
DISSOLVED
IN
SODA
COFFEE
OR
WHATEVER
THERE
WAS
SOME
INTEREST
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
IN
ASPARTAME
LOWERING
SEIZURE
THRESHOLDS
BUT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ANYTHING
EVER
CAME

IT
