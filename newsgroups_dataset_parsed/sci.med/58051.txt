RE
PREDNISONEWHAT
ARE
THE
SIGNIFICANT
LONG
TERM
SIDE
EFFECTS
I
HAVE
BEEN
TAKING
PREDNISONE
TWICE
A
DAY
FOR
A
WHILE
TO
CONTROL
ULCERATIVE
COLITIS
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
IF
I
REDUCE
THE
DOSAGE
THE
PROBLEM
BECOMES
WORSE
AT
THIS
POINT
I
SEE
MYSELF
TAKING
PREDNISONE
FOR
A
LONG
LONG
TIME
PERHAPS
FOR
EVER
I
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
LONG
TERM
MAJOR
SIDE
EFFECTS
THINGS
LIKE
POTENTIAL
BIRTH
DEFECTS
ARTHRITIS
ETC
I
HAVE
BEEN
PUTTING
ON
WEIGHT
MY
FACE
LOOKS
PUFFED
AND
ROUND
EXPERIENCE
SUDDEN
MOOD
SWINGS
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
THESE
ARE
ALL
SHORT
TERM
I
SECOND
WHAT
SPENSER
ADEN
SAID
IN
REPLY
ADDITIONALLY
IT
IS
HARD
TO
SAY
WHAT
TYPE
OF
RESPONSE
YOU
HAVING
TO
PREDNISONE
SINCE
YOU
DID
NOT
SAY
HOW
LONG
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
ON
IT
PATIENTS
ARE
GENERALLY
KEPT
ON
STEROIDS
FOR
MONTHS
BEFORE
THINKING
ABOUT
TAPERING
ALTERNATIVES
TO
DAILY
DOSING
ARE
EVERY
OTHER
DAY
DOSING
IN
YOUR
CASE
EVERY
OTHER
DAY
WOULD
BE
A
START
ANOTHER
OPTION
IF
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
GET
YOU
OFF
PREDNISONE
IS
TO
START
AZATHIOPRINE
LIKE
SPENSER
SAID
YOU
SHOULD
GENERALLY
BE
ON
ANOTHER
DRUG
IN
ADDITION
TO
YOUR
PREDNISONE
LIKE
ASULFIDINE
A
LOT
OF
THE
SPECIFICS
ABOUT
OPTIONS
THOUGH
DEPENDS
ON
SEVERITY
LOCATION
AND
DURATION
OF
DISEASE
AS
WELL
AS
HISTOLOGY
SO
TAKE
ADVICE
OFF
THE
NET
FOR
WHAT
IT
IS
WORTH
I
TREAT
PATIENTS
WITH
UC
AND
CROHNS
AN
EDUCATED
PATIENT
IS
A
GOOD
PATIENT
BUT
LET
YOUR
DOCTOR
KNOW
WHERE
THE
ADVICE
CAME
FROM
SO
THINGS
CAN
BE
PUT
IN
CONTEXT
YOU
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
CROHNS
AND
COLITIS
FOUNDATION
OF
