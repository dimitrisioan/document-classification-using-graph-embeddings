PERCEPTION
OF
DOCTORS
AND
HEALTH
CARE
THE
FOLLOWING
ARTICLE
BY
COLUMNIST
MIKE
ROYKO
IS
HIS
HUMOROUS
COMMENTARY
ON
SOME
OF
THE
PUBLICS
PERCEPTION
OF
DOCTORS
AND
THEIR
SALARIES
I
HOPE
SOME
OF
YOU
WILL
FIND
IT
AS
AMUSING
AS
I
DID
REPRINTED
WO
PERMISSION
THERES
NO
CURE
FOR
STUPIDITY
OF
POLL
ON
DOCTORS
SALARIES
BY
MIKE
ROYKO
TRIBUNE
MEDIA
SERVICES
ON
A
STUPIDITY
SCALE
A
RECENT
POLL
ABOUT
DOCTORS
EARNINGS
IS
RIGHT
UP
THERE
IT
ALMOST
SCORED
A
PERFECT
BRAINDEAD
IT
WAS
COMMISSIONED
BY
SOME
WHINY
CONSUMERS
GROUP
CALLED
FAMILIES
USA
THE
POLL
TELLS
US
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
AMERICANS
BELIEVE
THAT
DOCTORS
MAKE
TOO
MUCH
MONEY
THE
POLLSTERS
ALSO
ASKED
WHAT
A
FAIR
INCOME
WOULD
BE
FOR
PHYSICIANS
THOSE
POLLED
SAID
OH
ABOUT
A
YEAR
WOULD
BE
OK
HOW
GENEROUS
HOW
SPORTING
HOW
STUPID
WHY
IS
THIS
POLL
STUPID
BECAUSE
IT
IS
BASED
ON
RESENTMENT
AND
ENVY
TWO
EMOTIONS
THAT
RAN
HOT
DURING
THE
POLITICAL
CAMPAIGN
AND
ARE
STILL
SIMMERING
YOU
COULD
CONDUCT
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
POLL
ABOUT
ANY
GROUP
THAT
EARNS
AND
GET
THE
SAME
RESULTS
SINCE
THE
MAJORITY
OF
AMERICANS
DONT
MAKE
THOSE
BUCKS
THEY
ASSUME
THAT
THOSE
WHO
DO
ARE
STEALING
IT
FROM
THEM
MAYBE
THE
BERLIN
WALL
CAME
DOWN
BUT
DONT
KID
YOURSELF
KARL
MARX
LIVES
ITS
ALSO
STUPID
BECAUSE
IT
DIDNT
ASK
KEY
QUESTIONS
SUCH
AS
DO
YOU
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
EDUCATION
AND
TRAINING
IT
TAKES
TO
BECOME
A
PHYSICIAN
IF
THOSE
POLLED
SAID
NO
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
THEN
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DISQUALIFIED
IF
THEY
GAVE
THE
WRONG
ANSWERS
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DROPPED
WHAT
GOOD
ARE
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
HOW
MUCH
A
DOCTOR
SHOULD
EARN
IF
THEY
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
TAKES
TO
BECOME
A
DOCTOR
OR
MAYBE
A
QUESTION
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
PHRASED
THIS
WAY
HOW
MUCH
SHOULD
A
PERSON
EARN
IF
HE
OR
SHE
MUST
A
GET
EXCELLENT
GRADES
AND
A
FINE
EDUCATIONAL
FOUNDATION
IN
HIGH
SCHOOL
IN
ORDER
TO
B
BE
ACCEPTED
BY
A
GOOD
COLLEGE
AND
SPEND
FOUR
YEARS
TAKING
COURSES
HEAVY
IN
MATH
PHYSICS
CHEMISTRY
AND
OTHER
LAB
WORK
AND
MAINTAIN
A
AVERAGE
OR
BETTER
AND
C
SPEND
FOUR
MORE
YEARS
OF
GRINDING
STUDY
IN
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
WITH
THE
THIRD
AND
FOURTH
YEARS
IN
CLINICAL
TRAINING
WORKING
TO
HOURS
A
WEEK
AND
D
SPEND
ANOTHER
YEAR
AS
A
LOWPAY
HARDWORK
INTERN
AND
E
PUT
IN
ANOTHER
THREE
TO
YEARS
OF
POSTGRADUATE
TRAINING
DEPENDING
ON
YOUR
SPECIALTY
AND
F
MAYBE
WIND
UP
IN
DEBT
AFTER
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
AND
G
THEN
WORK
AN
AVERAGE
OF
HOURS
A
WEEK
WITH
MANY
FAMILY
DOCTORS
PUTTING
IN
HOURS
OR
MORE
UNTIL
THEY
RETIRE
OR
FALL
OVER
AS
YOU
HAVE
PROBABLY
GUESSED
BY
NOW
I
HAVE
CONSIDERABLY
MORE
RESPECT
FOR
DOCTORS
THAN
DOES
THE
LAW
FIRM
OF
CLINTON
AND
CLINTON
AND
ALL
THE
LAWYERS
AND
INSURANCE
EXECUTIVES
THEY
HAVE
CALLED
TOGETHER
TO
REMAKE
AMERICAS
HEALTH
CARE
BASED
ON
WHAT
DOCTORS
CONTRIBUTE
TO
SOCIETY
THEY
ARE
FAR
MORE
USEFUL
THAN
THE
POWERHAPPY
EGOTRIPPING
PROGRAMSPEWING
SOCIAL
TINKERERS
WHO
WILL
PROBABLY
GIVE
US
A
MEDICAL
PLAN
THAT
IS
TO
HEALTH
WHAT
CLINTONS
FIRST
BUDGET
IS
TO
FRUGALITY
BUT
PROPAGANDA
WORKS
AND
AS
THE
STUPID
POLL
INDICATES
MANY
AMERICANS
WRONGLY
BELIEVE
THAT
PROFITEERING
DOCTORS
ARE
THE
MAJOR
CAUSE
OF
HIGH
MEDICAL
COSTS
OF
COURSE
DOCTORS
ARE
WELLCOMPENSATED
THEY
SHOULD
BE
AMERICANS
NOW
LIVE
LONGER
THAN
EVER
BUT
WHO
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
OUR
LONGEVITYLAWYERS
CONGRESS
OR
THE
GUY
FLIPPING
BURGERS
IN
A
MCDONALDS
AND
THE
DOCTORS
PROLONG
OUR
LIVES
DESPITE
OUR
HAVING
BECOME
A
NATION
OF
SELFINDULGENT
LARDBUTTED
TVGAPING
COUCH
CABBAGES
AH
THAT
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
YOU
HEARD
PRESIDENT
CLINTON
OR
SUPER
SPOUSE
TALK
ABOUT
DURING
THE
CAMPAIGN
OR
SINCE
BUT
INSTEAD
OF
TRYING
TO
TURN
THE
MEDICAL
PROFESSION
INTO
A
VILLAIN
THEY
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
MORE
HONEST
IF
THEY
HAD
SAID
LET
US
TALK
ABOUT
MEDICAL
CARE
AND
ONE
OF
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEMS
WE
HAVE
THAT
PROBLEM
IS
YOU
MY
FELLOW
AMERICAN
YES
YOU
EATING
TOO
MUCH
AND
EATING
THE
WRONG
FOODS
MANY
OF
YOU
GUZZLING
TOO
MUCH
HOOCH
STILL
PUFFING
AWAY
AT
A
PACK
GETTING
YOUR
DAILY
EXERCISE
BY
LUMBERING
FROM
THE
FRIDGE
TO
THE
MICROWAVE
TO
THE
COUCH
DOING
DOPE
AND
BRINGING
CRACK
BABIES
INTO
THE
WORLD
FILLING
THE
BIG
CITY
EMERGENCY
ROOMS
WITH
GUNSHOT
VICTIMS
ENGAGING
IN
UNSAFE
SEX
AND
CATCHING
A
DEADLY
DISEASE
WHILE
BLAMING
THE
WORLD
FOR
NOT
FINDING
AN
INSTANT
CURE
YOU
AND
YOUR
HABITS
NOT
THE
DOCTORS
ARE
THE
SINGLE
BIGGEST
HEALTH
PROBLEM
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
IF
ANYTHING
IT
IS
AMAZING
THAT
THE
DOCS
KEEP
YOU
ALIVE
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
DO
IN
FACT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THEY
CAN
STAND
LOOKING
AT
YOUR
BLUBBERY
BODS
ALL
DAY
SO
AS
YOUR
PRESIDENT
I
CALL
UPON
YOU
TO
STOP
WHINING
AND
START
LIVING
CLEANLY
NOW
I
MUST
GO
GET
MYSELF
A
TRIPLE
CHEESY
GREASY
WITH
DOUBLE
FRIES
DO
AS
I
SAY
NOT
AS
I
DO
BUT
FOR
THOSE
WHO
TRULY
BELIEVE
THAT
DOCTORS
ARE
OVERPAID
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
SOLUTION
DONT
USE
THEM
THATS
RIGHT
YOU
DONT
FEEL
WELL
THEN
TRY
ONE
OF
THOSE
SPINE
POPPERS
NEEDLE
TWIRLERS
OR
HAVE
REV
BUBBA
LAY
HIS
HANDS
UPON
YOUR
HEAD
AND
DECLARE
YOU
FIT
OR
THERE
IS
THE
DOITYOURSELF
APPROACH
YOU
HAVE
CHEST
PAINS
THEN
SIT
IN
FRONT
OF
A
MIRROR
MAKE
A
SLIT
HERE
A
SLIT
THERE
AND
POP
IN
A
COUPLE
OF
VALVES
YOURE
GOING
TO
HAVE
A
KID
WHY
THROW
YOUR
MONEY
AT
THAT
OVERPAID
SAWBONES
SO
HE
CAN
BUY
A
BETTER
CAR
AND
A
BIGGER
HOUSE
THAN
YOU
WILL
EVER
HAVE
WHILE
PAYING
MORE
IN
TAXES
AND
MALPRACTICE

THAN
YOU
WILL
EVER
EARN
JUST
HAVE
THE

IF
IT
SURVIVES
YOU
CAN
