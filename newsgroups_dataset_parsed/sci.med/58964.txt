whats
the
difference
between
an
md
and
a
do
my
wife
and
i
are
in
the
process
of
selecting
a
pediatrician
for
our
first
child
due
june
we
interviewed
a
young
doctor
last
week
and
were
very
impressed
with
her
however
i
discovered
that
she
is
actually
not
an
medical
doctor
md
but
rather
a
doctor
of
osteopathy
do
whats
the
difference
i
believe
the
pediatrician
i
went
to
for
many
years
was
a
do
and
he
didnt
seem
different
from
any
other
doctor
ive
seen
over
the
years
my
dictionary
says
that
osteopathy
is
a
medical
therapy
that
emphasizes
manipulative
techniques
for
correcting
somatic
abnormalities
thought
to
cause
disease
and
inhibit
recovery
jeez
this
sounds
like
chiropractic
i
remember
getting
shots
and
medicine
from
my
pediatrician
do
and
dont
remember
any
manipulative
techniques
perhaps
someone
could
enlighten
me
as
to
the
real
practical
difference
between
an
md
and
a
do
also
im
interesting
in
hearing
any
opinions
on
choosing
a
pediatrician
who
follows
one
or
the
other
medical
philosophy
