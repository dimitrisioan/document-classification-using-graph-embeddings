WHATS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AN
MD
AND
A
DO
MY
WIFE
AND
I
ARE
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
SELECTING
A
PEDIATRICIAN
FOR
OUR
FIRST
CHILD
DUE
JUNE
WE
INTERVIEWED
A
YOUNG
DOCTOR
LAST
WEEK
AND
WERE
VERY
IMPRESSED
WITH
HER
HOWEVER
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
SHE
IS
ACTUALLY
NOT
AN
MEDICAL
DOCTOR
MD
BUT
RATHER
A
DOCTOR
OF
OSTEOPATHY
DO
WHATS
THE
DIFFERENCE
I
BELIEVE
THE
PEDIATRICIAN
I
WENT
TO
FOR
MANY
YEARS
WAS
A
DO
AND
HE
DIDNT
SEEM
DIFFERENT
FROM
ANY
OTHER
DOCTOR
IVE
SEEN
OVER
THE
YEARS
MY
DICTIONARY
SAYS
THAT
OSTEOPATHY
IS
A
MEDICAL
THERAPY
THAT
EMPHASIZES
MANIPULATIVE
TECHNIQUES
FOR
CORRECTING
SOMATIC
ABNORMALITIES
THOUGHT
TO
CAUSE
DISEASE
AND
INHIBIT
RECOVERY
JEEZ
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
CHIROPRACTIC
I
REMEMBER
GETTING
SHOTS
AND
MEDICINE
FROM
MY
PEDIATRICIAN
DO
AND
DONT
REMEMBER
ANY
MANIPULATIVE
TECHNIQUES
PERHAPS
SOMEONE
COULD
ENLIGHTEN
ME
AS
TO
THE
REAL
PRACTICAL
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AN
MD
AND
A
DO
ALSO
IM
INTERESTING
IN
HEARING
ANY
OPINIONS
ON
CHOOSING
A
PEDIATRICIAN
WHO
FOLLOWS
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
MEDICAL
PHILOSOPHY
