RUTH
GINZBERG
WRITES
BUT
ILL
BE
DAMNED
HIS
RIGHTS
TO
BE
SICK
TO
FAIL
TO
TREAT
HIS
DISEASE
TO
SPREAD
IT
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
WERE
INDEED
PRESERVED
HAPPY
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
I
TRIED
TO
COMMIT
A
PATIENT
WHO
WAS
GROWING
SALMONELLA
OUT
OF
HIS
STOOL
BLOOD
AND
AN
OPEN
ULCER
FOR
TREATMENT
THE
IDEA
WAS
THAT
THE
GUY
WAS
A
WALKING
PUBLIC
HEALTH
RISK
AND
THAT
FORCING
HIM
TO
RECEIVE
IV
ANTIBIOTICS
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
WAS
IN
THE
PUBLIC
INTEREST
I
WILL
MAKE
A
LONG
STORY
SHORT
BY
SAYING
THAT
THE
JUDGE
LAUGHED
AT
MY
IDEA
YELLED
AT
ME
FOR
WASTING
HIS
TIME
AND
LET
THE
GUY
GO
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
TUBERCULOSIS
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
ONLY
MEDICAL
AS
OPPSED
TO
PSYCHIATRIC
CONDITION
THAT
ONE
CAN
BE
COMMITTED
FOR
AND
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
VERY
SPECIFIC
LAWS
WERE
ENACTED
MANY
YEARS
AGO
REGARDING
TB
I
AM
CERTAIN
THESE
VARY
FROM
STATE
TO
STATE
ANY
LEGAL
EXPERTS
OUT
THERE
TO
HELP
US
ON
THIS
KM
