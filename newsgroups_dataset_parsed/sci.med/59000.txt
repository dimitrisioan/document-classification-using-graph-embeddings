KEN

WRITES
AS
A
PHYSICIAN
I
ALMOST
NEVER
GET
SICK
USUALLY
WHEN
SOMETHING
HORRENDOUS
IS
GOING
AROUND
I
EITHER
DONT
GET
IT
AT
ALL
OR
GET
A
VERY
MILD
CASE
WHEN
I
DO
GET
REALLY
SICK
IT
IS
ALWAYS
SOMETHING
UNUSUAL
THIS
WAS
NOT
THE
SITUATION
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
PARTICULARLY
ON
PEDIATRICS
PEDIATRICS
FOR
ME
WAS
THREE
SOLID
MONTHS
OF
ILLNESS
AND
I
HAD
A
TEMP
OF
WHEN
I
TOOK
THE
FINAL
EXAM
I
THINK
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
DURING
TRAINING
AND
BEYOND
WE
ARE
CONSTANTLY
EXPOSED
TO
NEW
THINGS
AND
WE
HAVE
THE
USUAL
REACTIONS
TO
THEM
SO
THAT
LATER
ON
WHEN
CHALLENGED
WITH
SOMETHING
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
A
REEXPOSURE
FOR
US
SO
WE
DEAL
WITH
IT
WELL
AND
GET
A
MILD
ILLNESS
THIS
IS
ALSO
COMMONLY
SEEN
IN
NEW
TEACHERS
THE
FIRST
FEW
YEARS
THEYRE
SICK
A
LOT
BUT
GRADUALLY
SEEM
TO
BUILD
UP
IMMUNITIES
TO
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
COMMON
COME
TO
THINK
OF
IT
I
WAS
ABOUT
MY
HEALTHIEST
WHEN
I
WAS
WORKING
IN
A
PATHOGENS
LAB
EXPOSED
TO
WHOKNOWSWHAT
