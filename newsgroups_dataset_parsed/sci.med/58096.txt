THIS
IS
MY
FIRST
POST
AND
I
AM
NOT
EVEN
SURE
IT
WILL
WORK
HERE
GOES
DID
ANYONE
READ
THE
EDITORIAL
ON
PAGE
IN
THE
MARCH
EDITION
OF
TIME
MAGAZINE
NOTING
THAT
MANAGED
CARE
IS
EXTREMELY
INEFFICIENT
OF
ALL
THE
POSSIBLE
CLIENTS
THAT
BILLARY
COULD
BE
PANDERING
TO
THE
INSURANCE
INDUSTRY
IS
THE
WORST
COMMENTS
I
AGREE
ADDING
LAYERS
OF
MANAGERS
AND
BUREAUCRATS
SIMPLY
EAT
UP
MONEY
THAT
COULD
BE
SPENT
ON
THOSE
WHO
ACTUALLY
ARE
DOING
THE
WORK
SUCH
AS
DOCTORS
AND
NURSE
AND
SUPPLIES
THE
MOST
EFFICIENT
SYSTEM
IS
PROBABLY
ONE
THAT
HAS
LIMITED
MANAGEMENT
AND
A
FIXED
BUDGET
SUCH
AS
ENGLANDS
OR
EVEN
CANADAS
IM
AFRAID
WE
ARE
ON
THE
WRONG
TRACK
THE
PROBLEM
MAY
BE
THAT
THE
INSURANCE
LOBBY
IS
TOO
POWERFUL
GORDON
BANKS
SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND
GEBCADREDSLPITTEDU
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
