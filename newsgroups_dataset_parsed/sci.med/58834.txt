CHRIS
BEST
WRITES
JASON
CHEN
WRITES
NOW
HERE
IS
A
NEW
ONE
VOMITING
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
MSG
BECOMES
THE
NUMBER
ONE
SUSPECT
OF
ANY
PROBLEM
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
MIGHT
BE
JUST
FOOD
POISONING
BUT
IF
YOU
HEARD
THINGS
ABOUT
MSG
YOU
MAY
THINK
IT
MUST
BE
IT
YEAH
IT
MIGHT
IF
YOU
ONLY
READ
THE
PART
YOU
QUOTED
YOU
SOMEHOW
LEFT
OUT
THE
PART
ABOUT
WE
ALL
ATE
THE
SAME
THING
CHANGES
THINGS
A
BIT
EH
FOOD
POISONING
IS
ONLY
ONE
OF
THE
MANY
POSSIBLE
CAUSES
YES
EVEN
OTHER
PEOPLE
SHARE
THE
FOOD
YOU
COMPLAIN
THAT
PEOPLE
BLAME
MSG
AUTOMATICALLY
SINCE
ITS
AN
UNKNOWN
AND
THEREFORE
MUST
BE
THE
CAUSE
IT
IS
EQUALLY
IF
NOT
MORE
UNREASONABLE
TO
DEFEND
IT
AUTOMATICALLY
ASSUMING
THAT
IT
CANT
BE
THE
CULPRIT
BOY
YOU
COMPUTER
PEOPLE
ONLY
KNOW
AND
BUT
NOT
MUCH
ABOUT
LOGIC
NO
I
DID
NOT
SAID
MSG
WAS
NOT
THE
CULPRIT
WHAT
I
ARGUED
WAS
THAT
THAT
THERE
WAS
ENOUGH
REASONABLE
DOUBT
TO
CONVICT
MSG
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
CONVICT
MSG
SHOW
ME
THE
EVIDENCE
NOT
QUILTY
BY
SUSPICION
PEPPER
MAKES
ME
SNEEZE
IF
IT
DOESNT
AFFECT
YOU
THE
SAME
WAY
FINE
JUST
DONT
TELL
ME
IM
WRONG
FOR
SAYING
SO
NOBODY
IS
FORCING
YOU
TO
CHANGE
WHAT
YOU
BELIEVE
BUT
I
CERTAINLY
DONT
WANT
TO
SEE
SOMEBODY
PREACH
TO
BAN
PEPPER
BECAUSE
THAT
MAKES
HIMHER
SNEEZE
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
SOME
ANTIMSG
ACTIVITIESTS
ARE
DOING
THESE
PEOPLE
ARENT
CONDEMNING
CHINESE
FOOD
MR
CHEN
JUST
ONE
OF
ITS
OPTIONAL
INGREDIENTS
TRY
NOT
TO
TAKE
IT
SO
PERSONALLY
LOOK
PEOPLE
WITH
A
LAST
CHEN
DONT
NECESSARILY
OWN
A
CHINESE
RESTAURANT
I
AM
NOT
INTERESTED
IF
YOU
ENJOY
CHINESE
FOOD
OR
NOT
EXPLOITING
MY
LAST
NAME
TO
DISCREDIT
ME
ON
THE
ISSUE
IS
HITTING
BELOW
THE
BELT
WHAT
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
IS
THE
TRUTH
LET
ME
GIVE
YOU
AN
EXCERT
FROM
A
RECENT
FDA
HEARING
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
ORALLY
CONSUMED
GLUTAMATE
HAS
ANY
EFFECT
ON
THE
BRAIN
SAID
DR
RICHARD
WURTMAN
OF
MASSACHUSETTS
INSTITUTE
OF
TECHNOLOGY
THE
ANECDOTAL
EXPERIENCES
OF
INDIVIDUALS
IS
SUPERSTITION
NOT
SCIENCE
HE
SAID
I
DONT
THINK
GLUTAMATE
HAS
MADE
THEM
SICK
AND
DR
ROBERT
KENNEY
OF
GEORGE
WASHINGTON
UNIVERSITY
CONDUCTED
AN
DOUBLE
BLIND
TEST
IN
SHOWING
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
REACTED
TO
MSG
ALSO
HAD
SIMILAR
REACTION
WHEN
THEY
THOUGHT
THEY
HAD
MSG
BUT
ACTUALLY
NOT
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
MANY
CONTRADICTING
PERSONAL
STORIES
TOLD
IN
THIS
GROUP
SOME
OF
THEM
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
DUE
TO
OTHER
CAUSES
BUT
BECAUSE
THE
ANTI
MSG
EMOTION
RUNS
SO
HIGH
THAT
SOME
BLAME
IT
FOR
ANYTHING
AND
EVERYTHING
MY
PURPOSE
IS
TO
PRESENT
A
BALANCE
VIEW
ON
THE
ISSUE
ALTHOUGH
I
AM
PROBABLY
OUTNUMBERED
