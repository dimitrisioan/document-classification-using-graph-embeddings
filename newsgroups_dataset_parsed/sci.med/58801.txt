RE
THE
BACK
MACHINE
UPDATE
I
HAVE
A
BACK
MACHINE
AND
HAVE
HAD
ONE
SINCE
JANUARY
WHILE
I
HAVE
NOT
FOUND
IT
TO
BE
A
PANACEA
FOR
MY
BACK
PAIN
I
THINK
IT
HAS
HELPED
SOMEWHAT
IT
MAINLY
ACTS
TO
STRETCH
MUSCLES
IN
THE
BACK
AND
PREVENT
SPASMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
PAIN
I
AM
TAKING
LESS
PAIN
MEDICATION
THAN
I
WAS
PREVIOUSLY
THE
FOLKS
AT
BACK
TECHNOLOGIES
ARE
VERY
RELUCTANT
TO
HONOR
THEIR
RETURN
POLICY
THEY
EXTENDED
MY
WARRANTY
PERIOD
RATHER
THAN
ALLOW
ME
TO
RETURN
THE
MACHINE
WHEN
AFTER
THE
FIRST
MONTH
OR
SO
I
WAS
NOT
THRILLED
WITH
IT
THEY
ENCOURAGED
ME
TO
CONTINUE
TO
USE
IT
ABEIT
LESS
VIGOUROUSLY
LIKE
I
SAID
I
CANT
SAY
IT
IS
A
CUREALL
BUT
IT
KEEPS
ME
STRETCHED
OUT
AND
I
AM
IN
LESS
PAIN
