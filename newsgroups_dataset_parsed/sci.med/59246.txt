RE
GREAT
POST
WAS
CANDIDA

IN

NORINGNETCOMCOM
JON
NORING
WRITES
OF
COURSE
THEY
ARE
WORKING
ON
THE
THEORY
THAT
CANDIDA
OVERBLOOM
WITH
PENETRATION
INTO
MUCUS
MEMBRANE
TISSUE
WITH
ASSOCIATED
MILD
INFLAMMATORY
RESPONSE
CAN
AND
DOES
OCCUR
IN
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
IF
YOU
REJECT
THIS
YEAST
HYPOTHESIS
THEN
ID
GUESS
YOUD
VIEW
THIS
RESEARCH
AS
ONE
MORE
WASTEFUL
AND
QUIXOTIC
ENDEAVOR
STAY
TUNED
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
ENOUGH
MEDICAL
EXPERTISE
TO
HAVE
MUCH
OF
AN
OPINION
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
ON
HIDDEN
CANDIDA
INFECTIONS
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
THE
SKEPTICISM
OF
THOSE
WHO
SEE
THIS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
VARIOUS
GENERAL
KINDS
OF
SYMPTOMS
WHILE
THERE
IS
A
LACK
OF
SOLID
DEMONSTRATION
THAT
THIS
HAPPENS
AND
CAUSES
SUCH
GENERAL
SYMPTOMS
TO
UNDERSTAND
THIS
SKEPTICISM
ONE
ONLY
NEEDS
TO
KNOW
OF
PAST
FAILURES
THAT
SHARED
THESE
CHARACTERISTICS
WITH
THE
NOTION
OF
HIDDEN
CANDIDA
INFECTION
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
A
FEW
AND
THE
PROPONENTS
OF
ALL
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
SKEPTICS
WERE
OVERLY
SKEPTICAL
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
AM
HAPPY
TO
READ
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
SUFFICIENTLY
INTERESTED
IN
THIS
POSSIBILITY
SPURRED
BY
SUGGESTIVE
CLINICAL
EXPERIENCE
TO
RESEARCH
IT
FURTHER
THE
DOUBTERS
MAY
BE
SURPRISED
IT
HAS
HAPPENED
BEFORE
I
REALIZE
THAT
ADMITTING
IGNORANCE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
IGNORANCE
MAY
NOT
ENDEAR
ME
TO
THOSE
WHO
ARE
SO
SURE
THEY
KNOW
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
AND
INDEED
PERHAPS
SOME
OF
THEM
DO
KNOW
I
AM
THE
ONE
WHO
IS
CURRENTLY
IGNORANT
BUT
I
FIND
THIS
THE
MOST
HONEST
ROUTE
AND
SO
I
AM
HAPPY
WITH
IT
