FULKCSROCHESTEREDU
MARK
FULK
WRITES
FLIGHTS
OF
FANCY
AND
OTHER
IRRATIONAL
APPROACHES
ARE
COMMON
THE
CRUCIAL
THING
IS
NOT
TO
SIT
AROUND
JUST
HAVING
FANTASIES
THEY
ARENT
OF
ANY
USE
UNLESS
THEY
MAKE
YOU
DO
SOME
EXPERIMENTS
IVE
KNOWN
A
LOT
OF
SCIENTISTS
WHOSE
FANTASIES
LEAD
THEM
ON
TO
CREATIVE
WORK
USUALLY
THEY
WONT
ADMIT
OUT
LOUD
WHAT
THE
FANTASY
WAS
PRIOR
TO
THE
CONSUMPTION
OF
A
FEW
BEERS
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
WARREN
JELINEK
NOTICED
AN
EXTREMELY
HEAVY
BAND
ON
A
DNA
ELECTROPHORESIS
GEL
OF
HUMAN
ALU
FRAGMENTS
HE
GOT
VERY
EXCITED
HOPING
THAT
HED
SEEN
SOME
ESSENTIAL
PART
OF
THE
CONTROL
MECHANISM
FOR
EUKARYOTIC
GENES
THIS
FANTASY
LED
HIM
TO
SEQUENCE
SAMPLES
OF
THE
BAND
AND
CARRY
OUT
BINDING
ASSAYS
THE
RESULT
WAS
A
WELLCONSERVED
OR
SO
BP
SEQUENCE
BUT
WHY
DO
YOU
CHARACTERIZE
THIS
AS
A
FLIGHT
OF
FANCY
OR
A
FANTASY
WHILE
I
AM
UNFAMILIAR
WITH
THE
SCIENTIFIC
CONTEXT
HERE
IT
APPEARS
OBVIOUS
THAT
HIS
SPECULATION
FOR
LACK
OF
A
BETTER
OR
MORE
NEUTRAL
WORD
WAS
AT
LEAST
IN
SIGNIFICANT
PART
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
HIS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
AND
ACCEPTANCE
OF
CURRENT
THEORY
COUPLED
WITH
HIS
OBSERVATIONS
IT
WOULD
APPEAR
THAT
SOMETHING
QUITE
RATIONAL
WAS
GOING
ON
AS
HE
ATTEMPTED
TO
FIT
HIS
OBSERVATION
INTO
THAT
THEORY
OR
TO
TAILOR
THE
THEORY
TO
COVER
THE
OBSERVATION
THIS
DOES
NOT
SEEM
LIKE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
WHAT
MOST
WOULD
NORMALLY
CALL
A
FLIGHT
OF
FANCY
OR
A
FANTASY
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
TO
ME
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
RATIONAL
VS
IRRATIONAL
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
GIVE
A
FEW
EXAMPLES
OF
SURPRISING
EXPERIMENTS
THAT
WERE
TRIED
OUT
FOR
PERFECTLY
RATIONAL
REASONS
OR
INTERESTING
NEW
THEORIES
THAT
WERE
FIRST
ADVANCED
FROM
LOGICAL
GROUNDS
THE
MAIN
EXAMPLES
I
CAN
THINK
OF
ARE
FROM
MODERN
HIGHENERGY
PHYSICS
WHICH
IS
NOT
TYPICAL
OF
SCIENCE
AS
A
WHOLE
WELL
I
THINK
SOMEONE
ELSE
IN
THIS
THREAD
WAS
THE
FIRST
TO
USE
THE
WORD
ALSO
EXTRASCIENTIFIC
ETC
NOR
AM
I
PREPARED
TO
GIVE
A
GENERAL
ACCOUNT
OF
RATIONALITY
IN
TERMS
OF
EXAMPLES
THERE
IS
SOME
DANGER
OF
BEGINNING
TO
QUIBBLE
OVER
WHAT
A
SURPRISING
EXPERIMENT
IS
WHAT
COUNTS
AS
SURPRISING
ETC
THE
SAME
MAY
BE
SAID
ABOUT
LOGICAL
GROUNDS
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
QUITE
FREQUENTLY
PERHAPS
EVEN
MOST
FREQUENTLY
THE
ROOTS
OF
A
NEW
THEORY
CAN
BE
TRACED
TO
PREVIOUSLY
EXISTING
THEORIES
OR
EVEN
TO
PREVIOUSLY
REJECTED
HYPOTHESES
OF
SOME
OTHER
THEORY
OR
DOMAIN
I
WOULD
OFFER
SOME
RATHER
WELL
KNOWN
EXAMPLES
SUCH
AS
TORICELLIS
PUY
DE
DOME
EXPERIMENT
DONE
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
HIS
SEA
OF
AIR
HYPOTHESIS
WAS
THIS
THEORY
AND
THE
RESULTING
EXPERIMENTAL
TEST
SURPRISING
WELL
GIVEN
THE
PRIOR
EXPLANATIONS
OF
THE
PHENOMENA
INVOLVED
IT
CERTAINLY
MUST
BE
COUNTED
AS
SO
WAS
THE
THEORY
CONSTRUCTED
AND
THE
EXPERIMENT
DESIGNED
OUT
OF
PERFECTLY
RATIONAL
GROUNDS
WELL
THERE
WAS
A
PRETTY
SUCCESSFUL
AND
WELL
KNOW
THEORY
OF
FLUIDS
THE
ANALOGY
TO
FLUIDS
BY
TORICELLI
IS
EXPLICIT
THE
NOVELTY
WAS
IN
THINKING
OF
AIR
AS
A
FLUID
BUT
THIS
WAS
QUITE
A
NOVELTY
AT
THE
TIME
WAS
THE
THEORY
INTERESTING
YES
WAS
IT
NEW
WELL
ONE
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
IT
WAS
MERELY
THE
EXTENSION
OF
AN
EXISTING
THEORY
TO
A
NEW
DOMAIN
BUT
I
THINK
THIS
BEGS
CERTAIN
QUESTIONS
WE
CAN
DEBATE
THAT
