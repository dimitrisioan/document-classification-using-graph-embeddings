I
DONT
THINK
EXTRASCIENTIFIC
IS
A
VERY
USEFUL
PHRASE
IN
A
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
BOUNDARIES
OF
SCIENCE
EXCEPT
AS
A
PROPOSED
DEFINIENS
EXTRARATIONAL
IS
A
BETTER
PHRASE
IN
FACT
THERE
ARE
QUITE
A
NUMBER
OF
WELLKNOWN
CASES
OF
EXTRARATIONAL
CONSIDERATIONS
DRIVING
SCIENCE
IN
A
USEFUL
DIRECTION
YEAH
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
HOLDING
UP
THE
EXTRARATIONAL
EXAMPLES
AS
EXEMPLARS
OR
AS
REFUTATIONS
OF
WELL
FOUNDED
METHODOLOGY
IS
THAT
YOU
RUN
SMACK
UP
AGAINST
SUCH
UNUSEFUL
DIRECTIONS
AS
LYSENKO
SUCH
EXTRA
RATIONAL
CASES
ARE
CURIOSITIES
NOT
GUIDES
TO
METHODOLOGY
AS
HAS
BEEN
NOTED
BEFORE
THERE
IS
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
MOTIVATION
AND
METHOD
NO
EXPERIMENTAL
RESULT
SHOULD
BE
ACCEPTED
UNLESS
IT
IS
DESCRIBED
IN
SUFFICIENT
DETAIL
TO
BE
REPLICATED
AND
THE
REPLICATIONS
DO
INDEED
REPRODUCE
THE
RESULT
NO
THEORETICAL
ARGUMENT
SHOULD
BE
ACCEPTED
UNLESS
IT
IS
PRESENTED
IN
SUFFICIENT
DETAIL
TO
BE
FOLLOWED
AND
REASONABLE
KNOWLEGEABLE
PEOPLE
AGREE
WITH
THE
FORCE
OF
THE
LOGIC
BUT
PEOPLE
TRY
EXPERIMENTS
AND
PURSUE
ARGUMENTS
FOR
ALL
SORTS
OF
CRAZY
REASONS
IRRATIONAL
MOTIVATIONS
ARE
NOT
JUST
CURIOUSITIES
THEY
ARE
A
LARGE
PART
OF
THE
HISTORY
OF
SCIENCE
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
NEGATIVE
POINTS
TO
MAKE
HERE
A
THEORY
OF
QI
COULD
CONCEIVABLY
BECOME
ACCEPTED
WITHOUT
DIRECT
VERIFICATION
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
QI
FOR
EXAMPLE
QUARKS
ARE
AN
ACCEPTED
PART
OF
THE
STANDARD
MODEL
OF
PHYSICS
WITH
NO
DIRECT
VERIFICATION
WHAT
WOULD
BE
NEEDED
WOULD
BE
A
THEORY
BASED
ON
QI
THAT
PREDICTED
MEDICAL
REALITY
BETTER
THAN
THE
ALTERNATIVES
THE
CENTRAL
THEORETICAL
CLAIM
COULD
LIE
FOREVER
BEYOND
EXPERIMENT
AS
LONG
AS
THERE
WAS
A
SUFFICIENT
BODY
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
DATA
THAT
THE
QI
THEORY
PREDICTED
BETTER
THAN
ANY
OTHER
I
WOULDNT
HOLD
MY
BREATH
WAITING
FOR
THE
TRIUMPH
OF
QI
THOUGH
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THERE
IS
EVEN
A
COHERENT
THEORY
BASED
ON
IT
MUCH
LESS
A
THEORY
THAT
EXPLAINS
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
BETTER
THAN
MODERN
BIOLOGY
AND
IT
IS
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
A
QI
THEORY
THAT
WOULD
NOT
PREDICT
SOME
WAY
OF
RATHER
DIRECTLY
VERIFYING
THE
EXISTENCE
OF

IS
