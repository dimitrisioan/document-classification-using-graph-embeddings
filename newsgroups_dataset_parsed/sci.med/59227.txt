i
use
it
saying
i
shouldnt
use
it
is
like
saying
i
shouldnt
eat
spicy
food
because
my
neighbor
has
an
ulcer
nobody
is
saying
that
you
shouldnt
be
allowed
to
use
msg
just
dont
force
it
on
others
if
you
have
food
that
you
want
to
enhance
with
msg
just
put
the
msg
on
the
table
like
salt
it
is
then
the
option
of
the
eater
to
use
it
if
you
make
a
commerical
product
just
leave
it
out
you
can
include
a
packet
like
some
salt
packets
if
you
desire
salt
pepper
mustard
ketchup
pickles
are
table
options
treat
msg
the
same
way
i
wouldnt
shove
my
condiments
down
your
throat
dont
shove
yours
down
mine
