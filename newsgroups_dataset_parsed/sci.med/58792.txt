AND

WAS
HOMEOPATHY
TRADITION
AVOIDING
MISTAKES
IS
CERTAINLY
HIGHLY
DESIRABLE
HOWEVER
IT
IS
ALSO
WIDELY
ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT
PERFECTIONISM
IS
INIMICABLE
TO
CREATIVITY
AND
IN
ORDINARY
LIFE
PERFECTIONISM
CARRIED
BEYOND
A
CERTAIN
POINT
IS
INDICATIVE
OF
A
PSYCHOLOGICAL
DISORDER
IN
THE
EXTREME
CASE
A
PERFECTIONIST
BECOMES
SO
PARALYZED
BY
ALL
THE
POSSIBLE
MISTAKES
HE
MIGHT
MAKE
THAT
HE
IS
UNABLE
TO
EVEN
LEAVE
THE
HOUSE
IN
SCIENCE
WE
WANT
TO
DISCOVER
AS
MUCH
TRUTH
ABOUT
THE
WORLD
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
WE
ALSO
WANT
TO
HAVE
AS
MUCH
CERTAINTY
AS
POSSIBLE
ABOUT
THESE
DISCOVERIES
USUALLY
THERE
IS
SOME
TRADEOFF
BETWEEN
THESE
TWO
DESIDERATA
THE
SEARCH
FOR
SCOPE
AND
THE
SEARCH
FOR
CERTAINTY
IF
CENTURY
MATHEMATICIANS
HAD
DEMANDED
TOTAL
RIGOR
FROM
NEWTON
AND
LEIBNIZ
THEN
THERE
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
NO
CALCULUS
TODAY
BECAUSE
NEITHER
OF
THE
TWO
COULD
EXPLAIN
CALCULUS
IN
A
WAY
THAT
REALLY
MADE
SENSE
SINCE
THEY
LACKED
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
LIMIT
AND
IN
FACT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LACK
OF
A
RIGOROUS
FOUNDATION
THEY
MADE
A
NUMBER
OF
ERRORS
IN
THEIR
USE
OF
CALCULUS
IT
WAS
ONLY
A
HUNDRED
YEARS
LATER
THAT
WEISTRASS
WAS
ABLE
TO
GIVE
A
SOLID
GROUNDING
FOR
THE
IDEAS
OF
NEWTON
AND
LEIBNIZ
NONETHELESS
WHAT
NEWTON
AND
LEIBNIZ
DID
WAS
UNDOUBTEDLY
SCIENCE
AND
MATHEMATICS
GAINED
A
GREAT
DEAL
MORE
FROM
THE
APPLICATION
OF
THEIR
IMPORTANT
IDEAS
THAN
IT
LOST
THROUGH
THE
MISTAKES
THEY
MADE
IN
ARTICLE
KINGREASONINGCOM
DICK
KING
WRITES
SOMEBODY
WRITES
I
DOUBT
IF
EINSTEIN
USED
ANY
FORMAL
METHODOLOGY
HE
ALSO
PROPOSED
NUMEROUS
EXPERIMENTS
WHICH
IF
PERFORMED
WOULD
DISTINGUISH
A
UNIVERSE
IN
WHICH
SPECIAL
RELATIVITY
HOLDS
FROM
ONE
IN
WHICH
IT
DOES
NOT
EINSTEIN
PLAYED
BY
THE
RULES
WHICH
DEMAND
THAT
HYPOTHESES
ONLY
BE
PUT
OUT
THERE
IF
THERE
EXISTS
A
SPECIFIC
EXPERIMENT
THAT
COULD
DISPROVE
THEM
THESE
ARE
NOT
THE
RULES
ACCORDING
TO
MANY
WHO
POST
TO
SCIMED
AND
SCIPSYCHOLOGY
ACCORDING
TO
THESE
POSTERS
IF
ITS
NOT
SUPPORTED
BY
CAREFULLY
DESIGNED
CONTROLLED
STUDIES
THEN
ITS
NOT
SCIENCE
TAKEN
TO
THE
EXTREME
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ATTITUDE
THAT
EMPIRICAL
STUDIES
ARE
EVERYTHING
AND
IDEAS
ARE
NOTHING
RESULTS
IN
A
COMPLETE
STULTIFICATION
OF
SCIENCE
FOR
ONE
THING
AN
INSISTENCE
ON
AN
ELABORATE
AND
EXPENSIVE
METHODOLOGY
RESULTS
IN
A
SORT
OF
SCIENTIFIC
TRADEUNIONISM
WHERE
THOSE
OUTSIDE
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
AND
LACKING
INSTITUTIONAL
OR
CORPORATE
SUPPORT
HAVE
NO
CHANCE
TO
OBTAIN
A
HEARING
I
DONT
IN
THE
LEAST
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
INTENTION
OF
THE
ARBITERS
OF
SCIENTIFIC
METHODOLOGY
NONETHELESS
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
RESULTS
AND
ALTHOUGH
INSTITUTIONAL
SCIENCE
HAS
CERTAINLY
PRODUCED
MANY
WONDERFUL
RESULTS
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
FOOLISH
ARROGANCE
FOR
SCIENTISTS
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
NO
ONE
OUTSIDE
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
AND
USING
LESS
THAN
PERFECT
EMPIRICAL
METHODOLOGY
WILL
EVER
COME
WITH
ANYTHING
WORTHWHILE
FURTHERMORE
THE
BIG
BUCKS
APPROACH
TO
SCIENCE
PROMOTES
WHAT
I
THINK
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
SIGNIFICANT
ERRORS
IN
SCIENCE
CHOOSING
TO
INVESTIGATE
QUESTIONS
BECAUSE
THEY
CAN
BE
READILY
HANDLED
BY
THE
CURRENTLY
FASHIONABLE
METHODOLOGY
OR
BECAUSE
ONE
CAN
READILY
GET
INSTITUTIONAL
OR
CORPORATE
SPONSORSHIP
FOR
THEM
INSTEAD
OF
DIRECTING
ATTENTION
TO
THOSE
QUESTIONS
WHICH
SEEM
TO
HAVE
FUNDAMENTAL
SIGNIFICANCE
FOR
INSTANCE
CERTAIN
QUESTIONS
CANNOT
BE
EASILY
INVESTIGATED
WITH
STATISTICAL
METHODS
BECAUSE
THE
RELEVANT
FACTORS
ARE
NOT
QUANTITATIVE
ONE
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
FOR
ALMOST
ALL
QUESTIONS
IN
MANY
AREAS
OF
PSYCHOLOGY
IN
MY
OPINION
A
PERUSAL
OF
MANY
OF
THE
PAPERS
RESULTING
FROM
THE
ATTEMPT
BY
PSYCHOLOGISTS
TO
FORCE
THESE
QUESTIONS
INTO
A
STATISTICAL
FRAMEWORK
GIVES
THE
LIE
TO
RUSSELL
TURPINS
ASSERTION
THAT
CURRENT
SCIENTIFIC
METHODS
AVOID
ALL
KNOWN
ERRORS
I
THINK
THAT
ASKING
THE
WRONG
QUESTION
IS
PROBABLY
THE
MOST
FUNDAMENTAL
ERROR
IN
SCIENCE
IGNORING
POTENTIALLY
VALUABLE
IDEAS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
OTHERS
AND
I
THINK
THAT
SCIENTIFIC
JOURNALS
ARE
FULL
OF
ALL
TOO
MANY
STUDIES
DONE
WITH
IMPECCABLE
EMPIRICAL
METHODS
BUT
WHICH
ARE
WORTHLESS
BECAUSE
THE
WRONG
QUESTION
WAS
ASKED
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IN
THE
ARGUMENTS
BETWEEN
BEHAVIORISTS
AND
COGNITIVISTS
PSYCHOLOGY
SEEMS
LESS
LIKE
A
SCIENCE
THAN
A
COLLECTION
OF
COMPETING
