WRITES
ARE
IN
A
DIFFERENT
CLASS
THE
BIG
QUESTION
SEEMS
TO
BE
IS
IT
REASONABLE
TO
USE
THEM
IN
PATIENTS
WITH
GI
DISTRESS
OR
SINUS
PROBLEMS
THAT
COULD
BE
DUE
TO
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
FOLLOWING
THE
USE
OF
BROADSPECTRUM
ANTIBIOTICS
I
GUESS
IM
STILL
NOT
CLEAR
ON
WHAT
THE
TERM
CANDIDA
BLOOM
MEANS
BUT
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
THAT
THRUSH
SUPERFICIAL
CANDIDAL
INFECTIONS
ON
MUCOUS
MEMBRANES
CAN
OCCUR
AFTER
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
THE
QUACK
DIAGNOSIS
THAT
HAS
BEEN
BEING
DISCUSSED
FOUND
IN
THE
SINUS
MUCUS
MEMBRANES
THAN
IS
CANDIDA
WOMEN
HAVE
BEEN
KNOWN
FOR
A
VERY
LONG
TIME
TO
SUFFER
FROM
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IN
THE
VAGINA
AND
A
WOMEN
IS
LUCKY
TO
FIND
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
IS
WILLING
TO
TREAT
THE
CAUSE
AND
NOT
GIVE
GIVE
HER
ADVISE
TO
USE
THE
OTC
ANTIFUNGAL
CREAMS
LUCKY
HOW
SINCE
A
RECENT
ARTICLE
RANDOMIZED
CONTROLLED
TRIAL
OF
ORAL
YOGURT
ON
REDUCING
VAGINAL
CANDIDIASIS
IVE
MENTIONED
TO
A
NUMBER
OF
PATIENTS
WITH
FREQUENT
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
THAT
THEY
COULD
TRY
EATING
OUNCES
OF
YOGURT
DAILY
IT
TURNS
OUT
MOST
WOULD
RATHER
JUST
USE
ANTIFUNGAL
CREAMS
WHEN
THEY
GET
YEAST
INFECTIONS
YOGURT
DANGEROUS
IF
THIS
WERE
A
STANDARD
PART
OF
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
AS
GORDON
R
SAYS
IT
IS
THEN
THE
INCIDENCE
OF
GI
DISTRESS
AND
VAGINAL
YEAST
INFECTIONS
SHOULD
DECLINE
AGAIN
THIS
JUST
ISNT
WHAT
THE
SYSTEMIC
YEAST
SYNDROME
IS
ABOUT
AND
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
QUACK
THERAPIES
THAT
WERE
BEING
DISCUSSED
THERE
IS
SOME
EVIDENCE
THAT
ATTEMPTS
TO
REINOCULATE
THE
GI
TRACT
WITH
BACTERIA
AFTER
ANTIBIOTIC
THERAPY
DONT
SEEM
TO
BE
VERY
HELPFUL
IN
REDUCING
DIARRHEA
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
ANYONE
WOULD
VIEW
THIS
AS
A
QUACK
THERAPY
DAVID
RIND
YOGURT
CONTAINS
LACTOBACILLUS
ACIDOPHILUS
AND
L
BULGARICUS
L
ACIDOPHILUS
IS
THE
MAJOR
BACTERIA
IN
THE
VAGINAL
TRACT
AND
IS
PRIMARILY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
KEEPING
THE
VAGINAL
TRACT
ACIDIC
AND
YEAST
FREE
MOST
OF
THE
COMMERCIAL
YOGURT
SOLD
IN
THE
US
HAS
A
VERY
LOW
L
ACIDOPHILUS
AND
L
BULGARICUS
COUNT
NEITHER
OF
THESE
BACTERIA
ARE
OBLIGATE
ANAEROBES
WITH
ARE
MUCH
MORE
IMPORTANT
IN
DEALING
WITH
THE
DIARRHEA
PROBLEM
GORDON
R
HAS
TOLD
ME
THROUGH
EMAIL
THAT
HE
GIVES
HIS
PATIENTS
L
ACIDOPHILUS
AND
SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
OBLIGATE
ANAEROBESWHICH
SETUP
SHOP
IN
THE
COLON
BUT
HE
HASNT
TOLD
ME
WHICH
ONES
YET
THE
LACTOBACILLUS
GENERA
ARE
MOSTLY
FACULTATIVE
ANAEROBES
AND
WILL
SETUP
SHOP
WHERE
THEY
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
OXYGEN
IF
GIVEN
A
CHANCEMOUTH
ANUS
SINUS
CAVITY
AND
VAGINA
HAVING
THESE
GOOD
BACTERIA
AROUND
WILL
GREATLY
DECREASE
THE
CHANCE
OF
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
IN
THE
ANAL
REGION
OR
THE
VAGINA
I
HAVE
NOT
PROPOSED
A
SYSTEMIC
ACTION
FOR
CANDIDA
BLOOMS
I
KNOW
THAT
OTHERS
SWEAR
THAT
ALL
KINDS
OF
SYMPTOMS
ARISE
FROM
THE
EVIL
YEAST
BLOOMS
IN
THE
BODY
IM
NOT
READY
TO
BUY
THAT
YET
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
COMPLICATIONS
AT
SPECIFIC
SITESVAGINA
ANAL
AND
MAYBE
LOWER
COLON
SINUS
AND
MOUTH
CAN
RESULT
FROM
ANTIBIOTIC
USE
WHICH
REMOVES
THE
COMPETING
BACTERIA
FROM
THESE
SITES
AND
THUS
LETS
CANDIDA
GROW
UNCHECKED
RESTORING
THE
RIGHT
BACTERIAL
BALANCE
IS
THE
BEST
WAYIN
MY
OPINION
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
PROBLEM
ANTIFUNGALS
A
LOW
CARBOHYDRATE
DIET
AND
VITAMIN
A
SUPPLEMENTATION
MAY
ALL
HELP
TO
MINIMIZE
THE
LOCAL
IRRITATION
UNTIL
THE
GOOD
BACTERIA
CAN
TAKE
OVER
CONTROL
OF
THE
FOOD
SUPPLY
AGAIN
AND
LOWER
THE
PH
TO
BASICALLY
STARVE
THE
CANDIDA
