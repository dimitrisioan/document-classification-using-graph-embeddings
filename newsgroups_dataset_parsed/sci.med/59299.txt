RE
OCD
THIS
IS
TO
FOLLOWUP
MY
PREVIOUS
REPLY
ON
THIS
TOPIC
WHICH
IT
HAS
BEEN
POINTED
OUT
TO
ME
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
DANGEROUSLY
MISLEADING
IN
TWO
SPOTS
I
STATED
THAT
PSYCHOTHERAPY
MEANING
TALKING
THERAPY
AND
SO
ON
WAS
USED
TO
TREAT
OBSESSIVE
COMPULSIVE
DISORDER
WHICH
THOUGH
SOMETIMES
TRUE
IS
MISLEADING
IT
IS
NOT
OFTEN
FOUND
EFFECTIVE
PARTICULARLY
BY
ITSELF
PRIMARY
TREATMENT
TODAY
USUALLY
CONSISTS
AT
LEAST
IN
PART
OF
DRUG
THERAPY
THE
MOST
CURRENT
THEORIES
OF
THIS
CONDITION
ATTRIBUTE
IT
TO
MORE
TO
BIOLOGICAL
CAUSES
THAN
PSYCHOLOGICAL
IN
PLACES
WHERE
THIS
DISTINCTION
BECOMES
IMPORTANT
I
MENTIONED
THAT
THE
DSMIIIR
MENTIONS
IMPULSES
AS
A
POSSIBLE
DIAGNOSTIC
MARKER
HOWEVER
THIS
MIGHT
LOOK
LIKE
SOMETHING
PEOPLE
ASSOCIATE
WITH
PSYCHOTIC
CONDITIONS
UNCONTROLLABLE
OR
UNPREDICTABLE
BEHAVIORS
WHICH
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
WITH
OCD
ONE
OF
THE
DIAGNOSTIC
CRITERIA
OF
OCD
IS
THAT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
CAN
AND
DOES
SUPPRESS
SOME
OF
THEIR
IMPULSES
ALTHOUGH
THEY
ARE
AN
UNENDING
SOURCE
OF
ANXIETY
THE
OBSESSIVE
THOUGHTS
AND
RITUALISTIC
ACTIONS
USUALLY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
OCD
ARE
MOST
FREQUENTLY
VERY
MUNDANE
AND
PREDICTABLE
CLOSER
TO
A
SUPERSTITIOUS
NATURE
THAN
A
DANGEROUS
NATURE
