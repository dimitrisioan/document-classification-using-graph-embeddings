RE
INFO
COLONICS
AND
PURIFICATION
COLONICS
WERE
A
HEALTH
FAD
OF
THE
CENTURY
WHICH
PERSISTS
TO
THIS
DAY
EXCEPT
FOR
CERTAIN
MEDICAL
CONDITIONS
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
DO
THIS
CERTAINLY
NO
NORMAL
PERSON
SHOULD
DO
THIS
FREQUENT
USE
OF
ENEMAS
CAN
LEAD
TO
A
CONDITION
IN
WHICH
A
PERSON
IS
UNABLE
TO
HAVE
NORMAL
BOWEL
PASSAGE
ESSENTIALLY
A
PERSON
BECOMES
ADDICTED
TO
ENEMAS
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
THIS
IS
A
VERY
UNPLEASANT
CONDITION
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
BEST
TO
AVOID
IT
