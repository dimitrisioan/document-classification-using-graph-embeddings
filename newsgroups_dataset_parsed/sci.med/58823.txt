well
folks
i
currently
have
a
yeast
infection
i
am
male
your
best
bet
or
at
least
your
husbands
is
to
treat
and
cure
your
infection
before
any
intercourse
if
you
must
use
a
condom
also
consider
other
forms
of
sexual
release
ie
handjobs
until
you
are
cured
though
i
cant
imagine
wanting
to
have
intercourse
during
a
fullblown
yeast
infection
chances
of
it
being
transmitted
to
the
male
are
quite
low
especially
if
hes
circumcised
but
it
can
happen
at
one
point
i
was
getting
recurrent
yeast
infections
and
the
dr
suspected
my
boyfriend
might
have
gotten
it
from
me
and
be
reinfecting
me
the
prescription
was
interesting
for
each
day
of
the
medication
a
week
i
was
to
insert
the
medication
then
to
have
intercourse
the
resulting
action
would
help
the
medicine
be
spread
around
in
me
better
and
would
simultaneously
treat
him
