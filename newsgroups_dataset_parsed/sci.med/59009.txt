RE
IS
MSG
SENSITIVITY
SUPERSTITION
FREQUENTLY
OF
LATE
I
HAVE
BEEN
REACTING
TO
SOMETHING
ADDED
TO
RESTAURANT
FOODS
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
THE
INSIDE
OF
MY
THROAT
STARTS
TO
FEEL
PUFFY
LIKE
I
HAVE
A
COLD
AND
ALSO
AT
TIMES
THE
INSIDE
OF
MY
MOUTH
ESPECIALLY
THE
TONGUE
AND
LIPS
ALSO
FEEL
PUFFY
THE
SITUATIONS
AROUND
THESE
SYMPTOMS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
INVOLVE
RESTAURANTS
USUALLY
CHINESE
THE
MOST
NOTABLE
CASES
A
CHEAP
CHINESE
FAST
FOOD
CHAIN
A
JAPANESE
STEAK
HOUSE
I
HAD
THE
STEAK
AND
ANOTHER
CHINESE
FAST
FOOD
CHAIN
WHERE
I
SAW
THE
COOK
PUT
ABOUT
A
TABLESPOON
OR
TWO
OF
WHAT
LOOKED
LIKE
SUGAR
OR
SALT
INTO
MY
FRIED
RICE
I
AM
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
MSG
ENHANCES
FLAVOR
BY
CAUSING
THE
TASTE
BUDS
TO
SWELL
IF
THIS
IS
CORRECT
I
DO
NOT
FIND
IT
UNREASONABLE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
HIGH
DOSES
OF
MSG
CAN
CAUSE
OTHER
MOUTH
TISSUES
TO
SWELL
ALSO
AS
THE
MANY
OF
THE
OCCURANCES
INCLUDING
TWO
OF
THE
ABOVE
INVOLVED
BEEF
AND
AS
BEEF
IS
FREQUENTLY
TENDERIZED
WITH
MSG
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
SUSPECT
AS
BEING
THE
CAUSE
I
WOULDNT
BE
AT
ALL
SURPRISED
IF
TOXICITY
STUDIES
OF
MSG
IN
ANIMALS
SHOWED
IT
AS
BEING
HARMLESS
AS
IT
WOULD
BE
VERY
STARTLING
TO
HEAR
A
LAB
RAT
OR
RHESUS
MONKEY
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THEIR
THROATS
FEELING
FUNNY
ANYONE
WHO
WISHES
TO
EXPLAIN
HOW
THE
MAJORITY
OF
FOOD
ADDITIVES
ARE
TOTALLY
HARMLESS
IS
WELCOME
TO
EMAIL
ME
WITH
THE
RESULTS
OF
ANY
STUDIED
THEY
KNOW
OF
I
WILL
PROBABLY
RESPOND
TO
THEM
HOWEVER
WITH
A
REMINDER
OF
HOW
LONG
IT
TOOK
TO
PROVE
THAT
SMOKING
CAUSES
CANCER
WHICH
THE
TOBACCO
COMPANIES
STILL
DENY
DM
IF
I
SOUND
GRUMPY
ITS
BECAUSE
I
HAD
BEEF
WITH
BROCCOLI
FOR
LUNCH
TODAY
AND
NOW
IT
HURTS
TO
SWALLOW
DAN
