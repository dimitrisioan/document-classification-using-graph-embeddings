section
transplants
from
living
donors
im
sure
the
pittsburgh
group
has
published
the
baboon
work
but
i
dont
know
where
in
chicago
they
were
doing
lobe
transplants
from
living
donors

im
sure
theyve
published
the
case
report
of
the
first
xenotransplant
was
published
in
lancet
i
can
send
you
a
reprint
if
you
are
interested
there
was
another
paper
sort
of
a
tour
of
the
horizon
written
by
starzl
and
published
in
the
residents
edition
of
the
annals

surgery
vol
october
its
in

dont
have
any
reprints

im
not
sure

our
experience

date
as
for
segmental
liver
transplants
from
living
related
donors
i
must
confess
to
a
total
ignorance
of
that
literature
we
are
philosophically
opposed
to
those
and
i
dont
keep
up
with
that
particular
field
