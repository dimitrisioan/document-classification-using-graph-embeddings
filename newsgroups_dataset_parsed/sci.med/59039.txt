JIM
ZISFEIN
WRITES
HEADACHES
THAT
SERIOUSLY
INTERFERE
WITH
ACTIVITIES
OF
DAILY
LIVING
AFFECT
ABOUT
OF
THE
POPULATION
DOESNT
THAT
SOUND
LIKE
SOMETHING
A
PRIMARY
CARE
PHYSICIAN
SHOULD
KNOW
SOMETHING
ABOUT
I
TEND
TO
AGREE
WITH
HMO
ADMINISTRATORS
FAMILY
PHYSICIANS
SHOULD
LEARN
THE
BASICS
OF
HEADACHE
MANAGEMENT
ABSOLUTELY
UNFORTUNATELY
MOST
OF
THEM
HAVE
HAD
WEEKS
OF
NEUROLOGY
IN
MEDICAL
SCHOOL
AND
MONTH
MAYBE
IN
THEIR
RESIDENCY
MOST
OF
THAT
IS
DONE
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
WHERE
MIGRAINES
RARELY
ARE
SEEN
WHERE
ARE
THEY
SUPPOSED
TO
LEARN
THOSE
WHO
ARE
DILIGENT
AND
READ
DO
LEARN
BUT
MOST
DONT
UNFORTUNATELY
SOMETIMES
I
WONDER
WHAT
TENSIONTYPE
HEADACHES
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
NEUROLOGY
ANYWAY
WE
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONES
SOMETIMES
WHO
HAVE
ENOUGH
INTEREST
IN
HEADACHES
TO
SPEND
THE
TIME
TO
GET
ENOUGH
HISTORY
TO
DIAGNOSE
THEM
TOO
OFTEN
THE
PRIMARY
CARE
PHYSICIAN
HEARS
HEADACHE
AND
LOSES
INTEREST
IN
ANYTHING
BUT
GIVING
THE
PATIENT
ANALGESICS
AND
GETTING
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
OFFICE
SO
THEY
CAN
GET
ON
TO
SOMETHING
MORE
INTERESTING
I
AM
EXCEPTING
MIGRAINE
WHICH
IS
ARGUABLY
NEUROLOGIC
HEADACHES
I
HOPE
YOU

SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY

IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
