re
lasers
for
dermatologists
it
is
not
true
that
dermatologists
gave
not
reached
the
laser
age
in
fact
lasers
in
dermatological
surgery
is
a
very
new
and
exciting
field
it
probably
wont
be
effective
in
tinea
pedis
because
the
laser
is
usually
a
superficial
burn
to
avoid
any
deeper
damage
limited
tinea
pedis
can
be
cured
albeit
sometimes
slowly
by
topical
antifungals
as
well
as
systemic
medication
ie
tablets
finally
a
selfdiagnosis
is
not
always
reliable
lichen
simplex
chronicus
can
look
like
a
fungal
infection
and
requires
very
different
treatment
