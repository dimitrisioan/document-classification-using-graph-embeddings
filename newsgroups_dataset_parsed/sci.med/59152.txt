im
not
saying
that
culturing
is
the
best
way
to
diagnose
its
very
hard
to
culture
bb
in
most
cases
the
point
is
that
dr
n
has
developed
a
feel
for
what
is
and
what
isnt
ld
this
comes
from
years
of
experience
no
serology
can
match
that
unfortunately
some
would
call
dr
n
a
quack
and
accuse
him
of
trying
to
make
a
quick
buck
why
do
you
think
he
would
be
called
a
quack
the
quacks
dont
do
cultures
they
poopoo
doing
more
lab
tests
this
is
lyme
believe
me
ive
seen
it
many
times
the
lab
tests
arent
accurate
well
treat
it
now
also
is
dr
ns
practice
almost
exclusively
devoted
to
treating
lyme
patients
i
dont
know
any
orthopedic
surgeons
who
fit
this
pattern
they
are
usually
gps
no
he
does
not
exclusively
treat
ld
patients
however
in
some
parts
of
the
country
you
dont
need
to
be
known
as
an
ld
specialist
to
see
a
large
number
of
ld
patients
walk
through
your
office
given
the
huge
problem
of
underdiagnosis
orthopedists
encounter
late
manifestations
of
the
disease
just
about
every
day
in
their
regular
practices
dr
n
told
me
that
last
year
he
sent
between
and
patients
a
week
to
the
ld
specialists
and
he
is
not
the
only
orthopedists
in
the
town
lets
say
that
only
people
per
week
actually
have
ld
that
means
at
the
very
minimum
people
in
our
town
and
immediate
area
develop
late
stage
manifestations
of
ld
every
year
add
in
the
folks
who
were
diagnosed
by
neurologists
rheumatologists
gps
etc
and
you
can
see
what
kind
of
problem
we
have
no
wonder
just
about
everybody
in
town
personally
knows
an
ld
patient
he
refers
most
patients
to
ld
specialists
but
in
extreme
cases
he
puts
the
patient
on
medication
immediately
to
minimize
the
damage
in
most
cases
to
the
knees
gordon
is
correct
when
he
states
that
most
ld
specialists
are
gps
