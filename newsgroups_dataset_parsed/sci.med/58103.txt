GLEN
W
BROOKSBY
WRITES
THIS
PAST
WEEKEND
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
LOST
HIS
MONTH
OLD
DAUGHTER
IN
A
MATTER
OF
HOURS
TO
A
FORM
OF
MENANGITIS
THE
PERSON
INFORMING
ME
CALLED
IT
NICEREAL
MENINGICOCIS
SP
IN
RETROSPECT
THE
DISEASE
STRUCK
HER
PROBABLY
SOMETIME
ON
FRIDAY
EVENING
AND
SHE
PASSED
AWAY
ABOUT
ON
SATURDAY
THE
SYMPTOMS
SEEMED
TO
BE
A
RASH
THAT
STARTED
SMALL
AND
THEN
BEGAN
PROGRESSING
RAPIDLY
SHE
BEGAN
TURNING
BLUE
EVENTUALLY
WHICH
WAS
THE
TIPOFF
THAT
THIS
WAS
SERIOUS
BUT
BY
THAT
TIME
IT
WAS
TOO
LATE
THIS
IS
ALL
SECOND
HAND
INFO
MY
QUESTION
IS
IS
THIS
AN
UNUSUAL
FORM
OF
MENANGITIS
HOW
IS
IT
TRANSMITTED
HOW
DOES
IT
WORK
IE
HOW
DOES
IT
KILL
SO
QUICKLY
THERE
ARE
MANY
ORGANISMS
VIRAL
BACTERIAL
AND
FUNGAL
WHICH
CAN
CAUSE
MENINGITITS
AND
THE
COURSE
OF
THESE
INFECTIONS
VARIES
WIDELY
THE
CAUSES
OF
BACTERIAL
MENINGITIS
VARY
WITH
AGE
IN
ADULTS
PNEUMOCOCCUS
THE
SAME
ORGANISM
WHICH
CAUSES
PNEUMOCOCCAL
PNEUMONIA
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
CAUSE
WHILE
IN
CHILDREN
HEMOPHILUS
INFLUENZAE
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
CAUSE
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DESCRIBING
IS
MENINGITIS
FROM
NEISSERIA
MENINGITIDIS
WHICH
IS
THE
SECOND
MOST
COMMON
CAUSE
OF
BACTERIAL
MENINGITIS
IN
BOTH
GROUPS
BUT
WITH
LOWER
INCIDENCE
IN
INFANTS
THIS
ORGANISM
IS
ALSO
CALLED
THE
MENINGOCOCCUS
AND
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
COMMON
EPIDEMICS
OF
MENINGITIS
THAT
OCCUR
AND
ARE
POPULARIZED
IN
THE
PRESS
WITHOUT
PROMPT
TREATMENT
AND
EVEN
WITH
IT
IN
SOME
CASES
THE
ORGANISM
TYPICALLY
CAUSES
DEATH
WITHIN
A
DAY
THIS
ORGANISM
FEARED
AS
IT
IS
IS
ACTUALLY
GROWN
FROM
THE
THROATS
OF
MANY
NORMAL
ADULTS
IT
CAN
GET
TO
THE
MENINGES
BY
DIFFERENT
WAYS
BUT
BLOOD
BORNE
SPREAD
IS
PROBABLY
THE
USUAL
CASE
RIFAMPIN
AN
ORAL
ANTIBIOTIC
IS
OFTEN
GIVEN
TO
FAMILY
AND
CONTACTS
OF
A
CASE
OF
MENINGOCOCCAL
MENINGITIS
BY
THE
WAY
SORRY
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
TIME
FOR
A
MORE
DETAILED
REPLY
MENINGITIS
IS
A
HUGE
TOPIC
AND
SCIMED
CANT
DO
IT
JUSTICE
