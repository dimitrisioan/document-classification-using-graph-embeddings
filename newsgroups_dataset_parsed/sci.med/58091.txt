WRITES
HOW
LONG
DOES
IT
TAKE
A
SMOKERS
LUNGS
TO
CLEAR
OF
THE
TAR
AFTER
QUITTING
DOES
YOUR
CHANCES
OF
GETTING
LUNG
CANCER
DECREASE
QUICKLY
OR
DOES
IT
TAKE
A
CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
FOR
THAT
TO
HAPPEN
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
I
READ
IN
EITHER
A
RECENT
NY
TIMES
SCIENCE
TIMES
OR
MAYBE
IT
WAS
SCIENCE
NEWS
THAT
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
THAT
EXSMOKERS
RISK
OF
LUNG
CANCER
NEVER
RETURNS
TO
THAT
OF
A
PERSON
WHO
HAS
NEVER
SMOKED
I
THINK
IT
MAY
GET
CLOSE
ILL
FIND
THE
ARTICLE
AND
POST
IT
SINCE
MY
MEMORY
IS
HAZY
ON
THE
SPECIFICS
IF
YOU
ARE
INTERESTED
