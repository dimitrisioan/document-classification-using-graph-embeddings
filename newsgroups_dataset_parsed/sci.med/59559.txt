antihistamine

i
am
looking
for
advice
for
the
use
of
antihistamines
as
sleep
aids
and
if
there
are
any
dangers
of
such
use
seems
safe
to
me
since
they
are
used
chronically
for
allergies
by
millions
i
dont
want
to
try
bzs
because
bz
addiction
seems
to
be
a
serious
threat
and
from
what
i
hear
bz
sleep
quality
is
not
good
whereas
antihistamine
sleep
quality
seems
to
be
better
for
me
i
have
tried
some
dietary
tryptophan
loading
stuff
and
that
also
seems
to
lower
sleep
quality
i
seem
to
wake
up
around
or
so
and
be
in
some
kind
of
mental
haze
until
or
also
i
would
be
interested
in
any
other
advice
for
helping
my
problem
although
ive
already
tried
many
of
the
nonpharmacological
solutions
well
i
think
you
might
want
to
visit
a
doctor
who
is
familiar
with
sleep
disturbances
because
antihistamines
only
help
induce
sleep
when
theyre
used
intermittently
they
lose
their
sedative
effect
if
theyre
used
on
a
nightly
basis
their
anticholinergic
effects
drying
of
secretions
relaxing
effects
on
smooth
muscle
can
be
problematic
in
some
people
such
as
those
with
glaucoma
or
prostate
enlargement
antihistamines
like
diphenhydramine
benadryl
or
doxylamine
unisom
are
potent
sedatives
which
are
useful
occasionally
chlorpheniramine
chlortrimeton
is
said
to
be
less
sedative
but
seems
to
work
well
in
some
people
both
chlorpheniramine
and
doxylamine
have
long
halflives
compared
to
diphenhydramine
and
so
may
produce
a
residual
hangover
or
drugged
feeling
the
next
morning
