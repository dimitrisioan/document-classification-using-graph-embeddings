now
here
is
a
new
one
vomiting
my
guess
is
that
msg
becomes
the
number
one
suspect
of
any
problem
in
this
case
it
might
be
just
food
poisoning
but
if
you
heard
things
about
msg
you
may
think
it
must
be
it
yeah
it
might
if
you
only
read
the
part
you
quoted
you
somehow
left
out
the
part
about
we
all
ate
the
same
thing
changes
things
a
bit
eh
you
complain
that
people
blame
msg
automatically
since
its
an
unknown
and
therefore
must
be
the
cause
it
is
equally
if
not
more
unreasonable
to
defend
it
automatically
assuming
that
it
cant
be
the
culprit
pepper
makes
me
sneeze
if
it
doesnt
affect
you
the
same
way
fine
just
dont
tell
me
im
wrong
for
saying
so
these
people
arent
condemning
chinese
food
mr
chen
just
one
of
its
optional
ingredients
try
not
to
take
it
so
personally
