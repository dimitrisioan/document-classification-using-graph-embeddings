MULTIPLE
DRUG
RESISTANCE
IN
TB
IS
A
RELATIVELY
NEW
PHENOMENON
AND
ONE
OF
THE
LARGEST
CONTRIBUTING
FACTORS
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
NO
LONGER
AS
SCARED
OF
TB
AS
THEY
WERE
BEFORE
ANTIBIOTICS
IT
WAS
ROUGHLY
AS
FEARED
AS
HIV
IS
NOW
NOT
THAT
NEW
YEARS
AGO
WE
HAD
DRUG
ADDICTS
HARBORING
ACTIVE
TB
THAT
WAS
RESISTANT
TO
EVERYTHING
IN
CHICAGO
THE
DIFFERENCE
NOW
IS
THAT
SUCH
STRAINS
HAVE
BECOME
VIRULENT
IN
THE
OLD
DAYS
SUCH
TB
WAS
WEAK
IT
DIDNT
SPREAD
TO
OTHER
PEOPLE
VERY
EASILY
AND
JUST
INFECTED
THE
ONE
PERSON
IN
WHOM
IT
DEVELOPED
BECAUSE
OF
NONCOMPLIANCE
WITH
MEDICATIONS
NONCOMPLIANCE
AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF
RESISTANT
STRAINS
HAS
BEEN
A
PROBLEM
FOR
A
VERY
LONG
TIME
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
HAVE
LIKE
DRUGS
AGAINST
TB
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
A
NEED
TO
DEVELOP
NEW
ONES
DUE
TO
SUCH
STRAINS
NOW
HOWEVER
WITH
A
VIRULENT
RESISTANT
STRAIN
WE
ARE
IN
MORE
TROUBLE
AND
MEASURES
TO
ASSURE
COMPLIANCE
MAY
BE
NECESSARY
EVEN
IF
THEY
ENTAIL
FORCE
GORDON
BANKS
SKEPTICISM
IS
THE
CHASTITY
OF
THE
INTELLECT
AND
GEBCADREDSLPITTEDU
IT
IS
SHAMEFUL
TO
SURRENDER
IT
TOO
SOON
