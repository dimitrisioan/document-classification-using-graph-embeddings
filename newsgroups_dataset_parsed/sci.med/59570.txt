colonics
were
a
health
fad
of
the
century
which
persists
to
this
day
except
for
certain
medical
conditions
there
is
no
reason
to
do
this
certainly
no
normal
person
should
do

also
insofar
as
it
doesnt
conform
to
the
accepted
medical
presumption
that
it
just
doesnt
matter
what
you
eat
and
that
we
can
think
of
the
gi
tract
as
a
black
box
in
which
nothing
ever
goes
wrong
except
for
maybe
cancer
and
ulcers
the
righteous
will
no
doubt
jump
on
that
too
recently
i
completed
a
week
juice
fast
with
days
of
water
and
had
two
colonics
as
part
of
it
my
motivation
was
primarily
spiritual
to
detoxify
from
all
the
crap
ive
been
putting
in
my
body
not
like
thats
enough
to
clean
it
all
out
but
it
did
have
an
effect
personaly
i
didnt
find
it
an
uncomfortable
experience
the
colonic
lost
about
of
beer
belly
which
hasnt
come
back
over
the
last
month
and
feel
great
one
of
the
things
that
prompted
me
to
get
the
colonic
was
seeing
my
year
old
grandmother
chair
ridden
from
colitis
from
years
of
indulgence
not
everything
that
goes
in
comes
out
and
personaly
i
dont
mind
giving
my
body
a
hand
once
in
a
while
just
my
experience
george
paap
i
am
my
beliefs
which
almost
certainly
are
not
those
of
my
employer
