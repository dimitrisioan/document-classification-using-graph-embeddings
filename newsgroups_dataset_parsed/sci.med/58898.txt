RE
WHAT
ARE
THE
PROBLEMS
WITH
NUTRASWEET
ASPARTAME
NUTRASWEET
IS
A
SYNTHETIC
SWEETENER
A
COUPLE
THOUSAND
TIMES
SWEETER
THAN
SUGAR
SOME
PEOPLE
ARE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
CHEMICALS
THAT
THE
BODY
PRODUCES
WHEN
IT
DEGRADES
NUTRASWEET
IT
IS
THOUGHT
TO
FORM
FORMALDEHYDE
AND
KNOWN
TO
FOR
METHANOL
IN
THE
DEGREDATION
PATHWAY
THAT
THE
BODY
USES
TO
ELIMINATE
SUBSTANCES
THE
REAL
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
THE
LEVELS
OF
METHANOL
AND
FORMALDEHYDE
PRODUCED
ARE
HIGH
ENOUGH
TO
CAUSE
SIGNIFICANT
DAMAGE
AS
BOTH
ARE
TOXIC
TO
LIVING
CELLS
ALL
I
CAN
SAY
IS
THAT
I
WILL
NOT
CONSUME
IT
PHENYLALANINE
IS
NOTHING
FOR
YOU
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
IT
IS
AN
AMINO
ACID
AND
EVERYONE
USES
SMALL
QUANTITIES
OF
IT
FOR
PROTEIN
SYNTHESIS
IN
THE
BODY
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
A
DISEASE
KNOWN
AS
PHENYLKETONEUREA
AND
THEY
ARE
MISSING
THE
ENZYME
NECESSARY
TO
DEGRADE
THIS
COMPOUND
AND
ELIMINATE
IT
FROM
THE
BODY
FOR
THEM
IT
WILL
ACCUMULATE
IN
THE
BODY
AND
IN
HIGH
LEVELS
THIS
IS
TOXIC
TO
GROWING
NERVE
CELLS
THEREFORE
IT
IS
ONLY
A
MAJOR
PROBLEM
IN
YOUNG
CHILDREN
UNTIL
AROUND
AGE
OR
SO
OR
WOMEN
WHO
ARE
PREGNANT
AND
HAVE
THIS
DISORDER
IT
USED
TO
BE
A
LEADING
CAUSE
OF
BRAIN
DAMAGE
IN
INFANTS
BUT
NOW
IT
CAN
BE
EASILY
DETECTED
AT
BIRTH
AND
THEN
ONE
MUST
SIMPLY
AVOID
COMSUMPTION
OF
PHENYLALANINE
AS
A
CHILD
OR
WHEN
PREGNANT
HEATHER
