SEIZURES
I
AM
POSTING
TO
THIS
GROUP
IN
HOPES
OF
FINDING
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
IN
NETWORK
NEWSLAND
WHO
HAS
HEARD
OF
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
TO
WHAT
I
AM
GOING
TO
DESCRIBE
HERE
I
HAVE
A
FOURTEEN
YEAR
OLD
DAUGTER
WHO
EXPERIENCED
A
SEIZURE
ON
NOVEMBER
AT
AFTER
EATING
KELLOGS
FROSTED
FLAKES
SHE
IS
PERFECTLY
HEALTHY
HAD
NEVER
EXPERIENCED
ANYTHING
LIKE
THIS
BEFORE
AND
THERE
IS
NO
HISTORY
OF
SEIZURES
IN
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
FAMILY
ALL
THE
TESTS
EEG
MRI
EKG
CAME
OUT
NEGATIVE
SO
THE
DECISION
WAS
MADE
TO
DO
NOTHING
AND
JUST
WAIT
TO
SEE
IF
IT
HAPPENED
AGAIN
WELL
WE
WERE
GOING
ALONG
FINE
AND
THE
OTHER
MORNING
APRIL
SHE
HAD
A
BOWL
OF
ANOTHER
KELLOGS
FROSTED
KIND
OF
CEREAL
FRUIT
LOOPS
I
AM
EMBARRASSED
TO
ADMIT
THAT
I
EVEN
BOUGHT
THAT
JUNK
BUT
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
SO
I
POUR
IT
IN
HER
BOWL
AND
THINK
OH
OH
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
JUNK
SHE
WAS
EATING
WHEN
SHE
HAD
THAT
SEIZURE
TEN
MINUTES
LATER
SHE
HAD
A
FULL
BLOWN
SEIZURES
THIS
WAS
HER
FIRST
EXPOSURE
TO
A
SUGAR
COATED
CEREAL
SINCE
THE
LAST
SEIZURE
WHEN
I
MENTIONED
WHAT
SHE
ATE
THE
FIRST
TIME
AS
A
POSSIBLE
REASON
FOR
THE
SEIZURE
THE
NEUROLOGIST
BASICALLY
NEGATED
THAT
AS
AN
IDEA
NOW
AFTER
THIS
SECOND
EPISODE
SO
SIMILAR
IN
NATURE
TO
THE
FIRST
EVEN
HE
IS
SCRATCHING
HIS
HEAD
ONCE
AGAIN
HER
EEG
LOOKS
NORMAL
WHICH
I
UNDERSTAND
CAN
HAPPEN
EVEN
WHEN
A
PERSON
HAS
A
SEIZURE
ONCE
AGAIN
WE
ARE
WAITING
I
HAVE
BEEN
THINKING
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
GOOD
TO
GET
TO
AS
LARGE
A
GROUP
AS
POSSIBLE
TO
SEE
IF
ANYONE
HAS
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
I
KNOW
THAT
MEMBERS
OF
THE
MEDICAL
COMMUNITY
ARE
SOMETIMES
LOATHE
TO
ADMIT
THE
IMPORTANCE
THAT
DIET
AND
FOODS
PLAY
IN
OUR
GENERAL
HEALTH
AND
WELLBEING
ANYWAY
AS
YOU
CAN
GUESS
I
AM
WORRIED
SICK
ABOUT
THIS
AND
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
IDEAS
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HAS
SORRY
TO
BE
SO
WORDY
BUT
I
WANTED
TO
REALLY
GET
ACROSS
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
HERE
