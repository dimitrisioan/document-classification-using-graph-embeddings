DEPRESSION
SOME
OF
THE
MDS
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
HAVE
BEEN
RIDING
MY
BUTT
PRETTY
GOOD
MAYBE
IN
SOME
CASES
WITH
GOOD
REASON
IN
THIS
POST
ON
DEPRESSION
IM
LAYING
IT
ALL
OUT
ILL
CONTINUE
TO
POST
HERE
BECAUSE
I
THINK
THAT
I
HAVE
SOME
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
COULD
BE
USEFUL
ONCE
YOU
HAVE
READ
THIS
POST
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
WHERE
IM
COMING

WHEN
I

WRITES
A
FAMILY
MEMBER
OF
MINE
IS
SUFFERING
FROM
A
SEVERE
DEPRESSION
BROUGHT
ON
BY
MENOPAUSE
AS
WELL
AS
A
MENTAL
BREAK
DOWN
SHE
IS
BEING
TREATED
WITH
HALYDOL
WITH
SOME
SUCCESS
BUT
THE
TREATMENTS
BEING
PROVIDED
THROUGH
HER
PSYCHIATRIST
ARE
NOT
SATISFACTORY
SOMEONE
SUGGESTED
CONTACTING
A
NUTRITIONIST
TO
DISCUSS
ALTERNATIVE
TREATMENT
SINCE
SHE
IS
SENSITIVE
TO
MEDICATION
I
THINK
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
SUGGESTION
BUT
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
TO
BEGIN
IF
ANYONE
CAN
SUGGEST
A
PHILLY
AREA
NUTRITIONIST
OR
ELSE
SOME
LITERATURE
TO
READ
ID
APPRECIATE
IT
LIDA
I
CAN
EMPHASIZE
WITH
YOUR
SITUATION
BOTH
MY
WIFE
AND
I
SUFFERED
FROM
BOUTS
OF
DEPRESSION
HERS
WAS
BROUGHT
ON
BY
BREAST
CANCER
AND
MINE
WAS
A
REBOUND
STRESS
REACTION
TO
HER
MODIFIED
RADICAL
MASTECTOMY
AND
CHEMOTHERAPY
LIDA
I
USED
MY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
NUTRITION
TO
GET
HER
THROUGH
HER
SIX
MONTHS
OF
CHEMOTHERAPYWITH
THE
APPROVAL
OF
HER
ONCOLOGIST
WHEN
SEVERE
DEPRESSION
SET
IN
A
FEW
MONTHS
AFTER
THE
CHEMO
STOPPED
I
TRIED
TO
USE
SUPPLEMENTS
TO
BRING
HER
OUT
OF
IT
I
HAD
CURED
HER
PMS
USING
SUPPLEMENTS
AND
I
REALLY
THOUGHT
THAT
I
KNEW
ENOUGH
ABOUT
THE
ROLE
OF
DIET
IN
DEPRESSION
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
HER
DEPRESSION
AS
WELL
IT
DIDNT
WORK
AND
SHE
WAS
PUT
ON
PROZAC
BY
HER
ONCOLOGIST
TWO
WINTERS
AGOTHREE
YEARS
AFTER
BY
WIFES
BREAST
CANCER
I
GOT
HIT
WITH
SEVERE
DEPRESSIONPRETTY
TYPICAL
AND
ONE
REASON
WHY
MANY
MARRIAGES
BREAK
UP
AFTER
BREAST
CANCER
OR
ANOTHER
STRESSOR
I
TRIED
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
IT
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
WITH
SUPPLEMENTATION
DIDNT
WORK
MY
INTERNIST
ENDED
UP
PUTTING
ME
ON
PROZAC
I
WAS
GOING
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
LIST
OF
SEVERAL
STUDIES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
USING
NIACIN
FOLATE
AND
TO
CURE
DEPRESSION
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
DO
THAT
BECAUSE
ALL
YOU
WOULD
BE
DOING
IS
FLYING
BLIND
LIKE
I
WAS
LIDA
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
DEPRESSION
CAN
HAVE
A
DIETARY
COMPONENT
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
YOU
NEED
TO
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
AND
THEN
USE
AN
APPROACH
WHICH
WILL
FIX
THE
PROBLEM
FOR
CHEMOTHERAPY
I
KNEW
EXACTLY
WHAT
DRUGS
WERE
GOING
TO
BE
USED
AND
EXACTLY
WHAT
NUTRIENTS
WOULD
BE
AFFECTED
SAME
THING
FOR
PMS
I
WAS
FLYING
BLIND
FOR
BOTH
OF
THESE
STRESSORS
BUT
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
I
USED
TO
DEVISE
A
TREATMENT
PROGRAM
WAS
PRETTY
GOOD
DEPRESSION
IS
JUST
TOO
COMPLICATED
WHAT
YOU
REALLY
NEED
IS
A
NUTRITIONAL
SCAN
THIS
IS
NOT
A
DIET
ANALYSIS
BUT
AN
ANALYSIS
OF
YOUR
BODIES
NUTRIENT
RESERVES
FOR
EVERY
VITAMIN
AND
MINERALEXCEPT
VITAMIN
C
YOU
HAVE
A
RESERVE
THE
RDA
IS
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
GIVE
YOU
ENOUGH
OF
ANY
NUTRIENT
TO
KEEP
THESE
RESERVES
FULL
IT
IS
ONLY
DESIGNED
TO
KEEP
THEM
FROM
BEING
EMPTIED
WHICH
WOULD
CAUSE
CLINICAL
PATHOLOGY
STRESS
WILL
INCREASE
YOUR
NEED
FOR
MANY
VITAMINS
AND
MINERALS
THIS
IS
WHEN
YOUR
RESERVES
BECOME
VERY
IMPORTANT

LET
ME
QUOTE
A
FEW
SENTENCES
FROM
THE
PREFACE
OF
THIS
NEW
TEXT
SOCALLED
NUTRITION
SPECIALISTS
WERE
IN
REALITY
GASTROENTEROLOGISTS
HEMATOLOGISTS
OR
PEDIATRICIANS
WHO
JUST
HAPPENED
TO
PROFESS
SOME
KNOWLEDGE
OF
NUTRITION
AS
IT
RELATED
TO
THEIR
FIELD
OF
PRACTICE
UNFORTUNATELY
ABOUT
TWO
THIRDS
OF
THE
MEDICAL
SCHOOLS
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
REQUIRE
NO
FORMAL
INSTRUCTION
IN
NUTRITION
BUT
TIMES
AND
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
HAVE
CHANGED
MORE
THAN
HALF
OF
THE
LEADING
CAUSES
OF

IN
THIS
COUNTRY

THIS
MONOGRAPH

ACCOMPLISH
THE
FOLLOWING
TWO
OBJECTIVES
IT
SHOULD
COMPLEMENT
YOUR
MEDICAL
TRAINING
BY
EMPHASIZING
THE
RELEVANCE
OF
NUTRITION
TO
YOUR
MEDICAL
PRACTICE
AND
IT
SHOULD
HEIGHTEN
YOUR
AWARENESS
OF
NUTRITION
AS
A
MEDICAL
SPECIALITY
THAT
IS
VITALLY
IMPORTANT

BOTH

PREVENTION
AND
THE
TREATMENT

EVERY

MY
ADVISE
TO
YOU
IS
THAT
YOU
TELL
YOUR
FAMILY
MEMBERS
TO
TRY
TO
FIND
A
PHYSICIAN
WHO
HAS
AN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
ROLE
THAT
VITAMINS
AND
MINERALS
YES
EVEN
MAGNESIUM
MAY
PLAY
A
ROLE
IN

WHO

MENOPAUSE
IS
OFTEN
A
TIME
WHEN
WOMEN
SUFFER
DEPRESSION
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
HORMONAL
CHANGES
THAT
ARE
OCCURING
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
ONES
THAT
OCCUR
DURING
PMS
A
NUTRITIONIST
MAY
ALSO
BE
ABLE
TO
HELP
NOT
TOO
LONG
AGO
A
POSTER
MENTIONED
THAT
HIS

HAD
DIAGNOSED

TESTTHE
SPECIFIC
TEST
FOR
THE
SELENIUM
RESERVE
MOST
CLINICAL
LABS
WILL
NOT
RUN
THIS
TEST
AND
I
ADVISED
HIM
TO
TRY
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THE

THAT
DID
THE
TEST
WAS
CERTIFIED
THERE
ARE
