RESOUND
HEARING
AID
THEORY
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
BASED
ON
COPIES
I
WAS
GIVEN
OF
SOME
ARTICLES
PUBLISHED
IN
HEARING
INSTRUMENTS
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
COMMENTS
ABOUT
THIS
AND
OTHER
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
FOR
HEARING
AIDS
THE
RESOUND
SYSTEM
WAS
DEVELOPED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SOME
RESEARCH
AT
ATT
AND
APPEARS
TO
TAKE
A
DIFFERENT
APPROACH
FROM
OTHER
AIDS
IT
APPEARS
TO
ME
THAT
A
NEW
PROGRAMMABLE
AID
LIKE
THE
WIDEX
JUST
USES
A
MORE
FLEXIBLE
AND
PROGRAMMABLE
VERSION
OF
THE
CLASSICAL
APPROACH
OF
AMPLIFYING
SOME
PARTS
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
MORE
THAN
OTHERS
AND
ADDING
SOME
COMPRESSION
TO
TRY
AND
HELP
OUT
IN
NOISY
SITUATIONS
THE
MAJOR
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
RESOUND
APPROACH
IS
THAT
IT
DIVIDES
THE
SPECTRUM
INTO
LOW
AND
HIGH
FREQUENCIES
SPLITTING
POINT
IS
PROGRAMMABLE
APPARENTLY
BASED
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
LOTS
OF
VOWEL
INFORMATION
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
THE
LOW
FREQUENCIES
WHILE
THE
IMPORTANT
CONSONANT
INFORMATION
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR
ME
IS
IN
THE
HIGH
FREQUENCIES
THE
TWO
BANDS
THEN
ARE
TREATED
WITH
DIFFERENT
COMPRESSION
SCHEMES
WHICH
ARE
PROGRAMABLE
THEY
HAVE
ALSO
DEVELOPED
A
NEW
FITTING
ALGORYTHM
THAT
BUILDS
ON
WHAT
THEY
CALL
ABNORMAL
GROWTH
OF
LOUDNESS
THIS
LATTER
IS
INTERESTING
AND
FITS
MY
OWN
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
THOUGH
I
THINK
THE
PHRASE
IS
MISSLEADING
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
CASE
IS
THAT
AS
YOU
EXCEED
THE
MINIMUM
THRESHOLD
FOR
A
PERSON
WITH
HEARING
LOSS
THE
DEFICIT
BECOMES
PROGRESSLIVELY
LESS
COMPARED
TO
NORMALS
AND
BY
THE
TIME
YOU
REACH
THE
TOO
LOUD
POINT
THE
SENSITIVITY
CURVES
APPEAR
TO
CONVERGE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
IF
YOU
JUST
BOOST
ALL
SOUND
LEVELS
YOU
ARE
OVERLOADING
AT
THE
HIGH
END
FOR
PEOPLE
WITH
HEARING
LOSSES
HENCE
WHAT
YOU
WANT
IS
PROGRESSIVELY
LESS
AMPLIFICATION
AS
THE
SIGNAL
GET
CLOSER
TO
THE
MAXIMUM
TOLERABLE
POINT
YOU
WANT
TO
BOOST
LOW
VOLUME
SOUNDS
MORE
THAN
HIGH
AND
DO
SO
POTENTIALLY
DIFFERENTLY
FOR
THE
LOW
AND
HIGH
FREQUENCY
PARTS
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
SPECIALLY
FOR
SOMEONE
LIKE
ME
WHO
IS
RELATIVELY
NORMAL
UP
TO
CPS
AND
THEN
FALLS
OFF
A
CLIFF
AIDS
WITH
SIMPLE
COMPRESSORS
DONT
DESCRIMINATE
BETWEEN
ENERGY
IN
THE
LOW
AND
HIGH
FREQUENCIES
AND
CAN
THEREFOR
COMPRESS
USEFUL
HIGH
FREQUENCY
INFORMATION
BECAUSE
OF
