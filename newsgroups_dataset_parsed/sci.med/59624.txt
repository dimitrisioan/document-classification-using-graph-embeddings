but
after
you
have
taken
antihistamines
for
a
few
nights
doesnt
it
start
to
have
a
paradoxical
effect
i
used
to
take
one
every
night
for
allergies
and
couldnt
figure
out
why
i
developed
bad
insomnia
insomnia
is
a
known
but
relatively
infrequent
sideeffect
of
diphenhydramine
for
most
people
this
does
not
occur
on
the
other
hand
most
people
can
build
up
a
tolerance
to
an
antihistamine
with
extended
use
allergy
sufferers
are
often
switched
from
one
antihistamine
to
another
to
avoid
this
