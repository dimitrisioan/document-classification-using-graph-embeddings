ARTHRITIS
AND
DIABETES
I
HAVE
OSTEOARTHRITIS
AND
MY
HUBAND
HAS
JUST
BEEN
DIAGNOSED
WITH
DIABETES
TYPE
II
I
GUESSNO
INSULIN
IVE
BEEN
TRYING
TO
READ
UP
ON
THESE
TWO
CONDITIONS
AND
WHAT
REALLY
SURPRISES
ME
IS
HOW
FEW
EXPERIMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
DONE
AND
HOW
LITTLE
IS
KNOWN
LOSING
WEIGHT
APPEARS
TO
BE
IMPERATIVE
FOR
DIABETES
AND
ADVISABLE
FOR
ARTHRITIS
AT
LEAST
FOR
WOMEN
WITH
ARTHRITIS
BUT
OF
COURSE
THE
VERY
CONDITIONS
THAT
MAKE
WEIGHT
LOSS
ADVISABLE
ARE
PART
OF
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
WEIGHT
GAIN
FOR
MYSELF
IM
ALMOST
AFRAID
TO
LOSE
WEIGHT
BECAUSE
NO
MATTER
HOW
GENTLE
AND
SENSIBLE
A
DIET
I
USE
THE
LAST
ONE
WAS
CALORIES
IN
ABOUT
EIGHT
SMALL
MEALS
THE
WEIGHT
WONT
GO
OFF
GRADUALLY
AND
STAY
OFF
INSTEAD
IT
DROPS
OFF
PRECIPITOUSLY
AND
THEN
COMES
BACK
ON
WITH
MUCH
INTEREST
LIKE
BREAD
ON
THE
WATERS
WITH
THIS
EXPERIENCE
ITS
HARD
TO
BE
ENCOURAGING
TO
MY
HUSBAND
ALL
I
CAN
SUGGEST
IS
TO
MAKE
IT
AS
GRADUAL
AS
POSSIBLE
MEANWHILE
SOME
EXPERTS
RECOMMEND
NO
SUGAR
OTHERS
NO
FAT
OTHERS
JUST
A
BALANCED
DIET
ITS
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TELL
FROM
THEIR
WRITINGS
WHICH
PARTS
OF
THEIR
RECOMMENDATIONS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
HELP
THE
CONDITION
AND
WHICH
ARE
MERELY
IDEAS
THE
EXPERT
THINKS
ARE
NIFTY
IS
IT
MY
IMAGINATION
OR
ARE
THESE
VERY
OLD
CONDITIONS
VERY
POORLY
UNDERSTOOD
IS
IT
JUST
THAT
IM
USED
TO
PEDIATRICIANTALK
ITS
STREP
GIVE
HIM
THIS
AND
HELL
GET
WELL
AND
SO
MY
EXPECTATIONS
ARE
TOO
HIGH
BONITA
KALE
