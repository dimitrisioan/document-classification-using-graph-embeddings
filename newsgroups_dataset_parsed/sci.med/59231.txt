one
thing
that
i
havent
seen
in
this
thread
is
a
discussion
of
the
relation
between
ibd
inflammation
and
the
profile
of
ingested
fatty
acids
fas
even
write
a
letter
to
the
editor
it
is
a
good
point
by
the
way
the
abbreviation
epa
is
not
in
general
use
so
i
do
not
know
what
fatty
acid
you
are
speaking
about
sorry
i
mean
eicosapentaenoic
acid
and
to
brian
an
u
of
c
there
is
a
physician
named
stephen
hanauer
there
who
is
a
recognized
expert
in
the
treatment
of
ibd
you
might
give
him
a
call
coincidentaly
just
yesterday
i
was
finally
referred
from
the
clinic
to
hanauer
im
seeing
him
on
may
ill
report
what
he
says
about
this
question
the
treatment
of
ibd
if
you
call
please
say
hello
to
him
from
me
i
was
looking
at
u
of
c
for
a
position
and
perhaps
still
am
will
do
