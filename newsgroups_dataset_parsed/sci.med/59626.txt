RE
PERSISTENT
VS
CHRONIC
IN
ARTICLE
KENNETH
GILBERT
WRITES
SERIOUSLY
THOUGH
I
WONDER
HOW
SOMEONE
WITH
CPH
WOULD
END
UP
GETTING
A
BIOPSY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
MY
UNDERSTANDING
AND
FEEL
FREE
TO
CORRECT
ME
IS
THAT
THE
ENZYMES
ARE
AT
WORST
MILDLY
ELEVATED
WITH
OVERALL
NORMAL
HEPATIC
FUNCTION
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THE
ONLY
CLUE
MIGHT
BE
A
HISTORY
OF
PRIOR
HEPB
INFECTION
AND
A
POSITIVE
HEPBSAG
OR
IS
IT
INDEED
ON
A
CONTINUUM
WITH
CAH
AND
THE
DISTINCTION
MERELY
ONE
OF
PATHOLOGY
AND
PROGNOSIS
BUT
OTHERWISE
IDENTICAL
CLINICAL
FEATURES
CHRONIC
PERSISTENT
HEPATITIS
IS
USUALLY
DIAGNOSED
WHEN
SOMEONE
DOES
A
LIVER
BIOPSY
ON
A
PATIENT
THAT
HAS
PERSISTENTLY
ELEVATED
SERUM
TRANSAMINASES
MONTHS
AFTER
A
BOUT
OF
ACUTE
VIRAL
HEPATITIS
OR
WHEN
SOMEONE
IS
FOUND
TO
HAVE
PERSISTENTLY
ELEVATED
TRANSAMINASES
ON
ROUTINE
SCREENING
TESTS
THE
DEGREE
OF
ELEVATION
IN
THE
SERUM
TRANSAMINASES
CAN
BE
TRIVIAL
OR
AS
MUCH
AS
TEN
TIMES
NORMAL
OTHER
BLOOD
CHEMISTRIES
ARE
USUALLY
NORMAL
AS
A
RULE
PATIENTS
WITH
CPH
HAVE
NO
CLINICAL
SIGNS
OF
LIVER
DISEASE
CHRONIC
ACTIVE
HEPATITIS
CAN
ALSO
BE
ASYMPTOMATIC
OR
MINIMALLY
SYMPTOMATIC
AT
LEAST
INITIALLY
AND
THATS
WHY
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
TELL
THEM
APART
BY
MEANS
OF
A
BIOPSY
THE
PATIENT
WITH
CPH
ONLY
NEEDS
TO
BE
REASSURED
THE
PATIENT
WITH
CAH
NEEDS
TO
BE
TREATED
