RE
SHOULD
I
BE
ANGRY
AT
THIS
DOCTOR
IN
ARTICLE
MRYANSTSCIEDU
WRITES
AM
I
JUSTIFIED
IN
BEING
PISSED
OFF
AT
THIS
DOCTOR
LAST
SATURDAY
EVENING
MY
YEAR
OLD
SON
CUT
HIS
FINGER
BADLY
WITH
A
KNIFE
I
TOOK
HIM
TO
A
LOCAL
URGENT
AND
GENERAL
CARE
CLINIC
AT
PM
THE
STORY
DELETED
BE
BOTHERED
MY
SON
DID
GET
THREE
STITCHES
AT
THE
EMERGENCY
ROOM
IM
STILL
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
WHO
IS
IN
CHARGE
OF
THAT
CLINIC
SO
I
CAN
WRITE
THEM
A
LETTER
WE
WILL
CERTAINLY
NEVER
SET
FOOT
IN
THAT
CLINIC
AGAIN
THE
PEOPLE
IN
CHARGE
ALREADY
KNOW
WHAT
KIND
OF
CARE
THEY
ARE
PROVIDING
AND
THEY
DONT
GIVE
A
RATS
ASS
ABOUT
YOUR
REPEAT
BUSINESS
YOU
ARE
MUCH
MORE
LIKELY
TO
DO
SOME
GOOD
WRITING
TO
LOCAL
NEWSPAPERS
AND
BROADCAST
NEWS
SHOWS
IF
YOU
DO
KEEP
THE
LETTER
SHORT
AND
TO
THE
POINT
SO
THEY
DONT
DISCARD
IT
OUT
OF
HAND
AND
EMPHASIZE
EXACTLY
WHAT
YOU
ARE
UPSET
ABOUT
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
LOCAL
HEALTH
DEPARTMENT
CAN
HELP
YOU
COMPLAIN
TO
SOMEONE
OFFICIAL
BUT
REALLY
THAT
CLINIC
EXISTS
FOR
THE
SOLE
PURPOSE
OF
GENERATING
WALKIN
INCOME
THROUGH
ADVERTISING
AND
NOTHING
YOU
CAN
DO
WILL
CHANGE
THEM
ALL
YOU
CAN
HOPE
FOR
IS
TO
HELP
SOMEONE
ELSE
AVOID
THEM
IM
GLAD
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOUR
SON
DID
OK
ANYWAY
MY
OPINION
ONLY
OF
COURSE
STEVE
