EUGENICS
GORDON
BANKS
WRITES
PROBABLY
WITHIN
YEARS
A
NEW
TYPE
OF
EUGENICS
WILL
BE
POSSIBLE
MAYBE
EVEN
SOONER
WE
ARE
NOW
MAPPING
THE
HUMAN
GENOME
WE
WILL
THEN
START
TO
WORK
ON
MANIPULATION
OF
THAT
GENOME
USING
GENETIC
ENGINEERING
WE
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
INSERT
WHATEVER
GENES
WE
WANT
NO
BREEDING
NO
HYBRIDS
ETC
THE
ETHICAL
QUESTION
IS
SHOULD
WE
TWO
PAST
PROBLEMS
WITH
EUGENICS
HAVE
BEEN
REDUCING
THE
GENE
POOL
AND
DEFINING
THE
STATUS
OF
THE
EUGENIZED
INSERTING
GENES
WOULD
NOT
SEEM
TO
REDUCE
THE
GENE
POOL
UNLESS
THE
INSERTED
GENES
LATER
BECAME
TRANSMISSIBLE
TO
PROGENY
THEN
THEY
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
CROWD
OUT
GARBAGE
GENES
THIS
MAY
IN
THE
FUTURE
BECOME
POSSIBLE
EVEN
IF
IT
DOES
AWARENESS
OF
THE
NEED
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
GENE
POOL
WOULD
HOPEFULLY
MEAN
PROVISIONS
WILL
BE
MADE
FOR
SAVING
GENES
THAT
MAY
COME
IN
HANDY
LATER
EVIDENTLY
THE
GENES
FOR
SICKLE
CELL
DISEASE
IN
EQUATORIAL
AFRICA
AND
FOR
DIABETES
IN
THE
HOPI
PROMOTED
SURVIVAL
IN
SOME
CONDITIONS
WE
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
WHAT
THE
FUTURE
MAY
HOLD
FOR
OUR
ENVIRONMENT
THE
REDUCED
WILDERNESS
AND
DISEASESURVIVAL
CAPACITY
OF
OUR
RELATIVELY
INBRED
DOMESTICATED
ANIMALS
COMES
TO
MIND
VULCANISM
NUCLEAR
WINTER

AGE
METEOR
IMPACT
NEW
MICROBIOLOGICAL
THREATS
FAMINE
GLOBAL
WARMING
ETC
ETC
ARE
ALL
CONCEIVABLE
THEREFORE
HAVING
AS
MANY
GENES
AS
POSSIBLE
AVAILABLE
IS
A
GOOD
STRATEGY
FOR
SPECIES
SURVIVAL
OF
COURSE
THE
STATUS
OF
GENETICALLY
ALTERED
INDIVIDUALS
WOULD
START
OUT
AS
NO
DIFFERENT
THAN
ANYONE
ELSES
BUT
IF
WE
COULD
MAKE
PHILOSOPHERKINGS
WITH
GREAT
BODIES
AND
LONG
LIVES
WOULD
WE
OR
THEY
WANT
TO
GIVE
THEM
ELEVATED
STATUS
WE
COULD
THE
ROMANS
DID
IT
WITH
THEIR
KINGS
WITHOUT
THE
BENEFITS
OF
SUCH
EUGENICS
THE
RACE
EVENTUALLY
REALIZED
AND
DEALT
WITH
THE
PROBLEMS
WHICH
THAT
CAUSED
BUT
FOR
A
WHILE
IT
WAS
A
PROBLEM
ORWELL
INTRODUCED
US
TO
THE
NOTION
OF
WHAT
MIGHT
HAPPEN
TO
PERSONS
GENETICALLY
ALTERED
FOR
MORE
MENIAL
TASKS
BUT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
NEW
UNDER
THE
SUN
WE
TREATED
SLAVES
THE
SAME
WAY
FOR
MILLENNIA
BEFORE
I
SEE
NO
INHERENT
PROBLEM
WITH
GENE
THERAPY
WHICH
AVOIDS
AT
LEAST
THESE
PROBLEMS
HUMANS
HAVE
ALWAYS
HAD
TROUBLE
HAVING
THE
VIRTUE
AND
WISDOM
TO
USE
ANY
POWER
THAT
FALLS
INTO
THEIR
HANDS
TO
GOOD
ENDS
ALL
THE
TIME
THAT
HASNT
STOPPED
THE
RACE
AS
A
WHOLE
YET
MANY
ARE
THE
CIVILIZATIONS
WHICH
HAVE
DIED
FROM
INABILITY
TO
ADAPT
TO
ENVIRONMENTAL
CHANGE
HOWEVER
ALSO
MANY
ARE
THE
CIVILIZATIONS
WHICH
HAVE
DIED
FROM
THE
ABUSE
OF
THEIR
OWN
POWER
THE
ONES
WHICH
SURVIVED
HAVE
HOPEFULLY
LEARNED
A
LESSON
FROM
THE
FATES
OF
OTHERS
AND
HAVE
SURVIVED
BY
MAKING
BETTER
CHOICES
WHEN
THEIR
TURNS
CAME
NOT
THAT
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THIS
GENE
ALTERING
POWER
COULDNT
WIPE
US
OFF
THE
FACE
OF
THE
EARTH
OR
CAUSE
ENDLESS
SUFFERING
NUCLEAR
POWER
OR
GLOBAL
WARMING
OR
WHATEVER
COULD
AND
MAY
STILL
DO
THAT
TOO
THE
REAL
ISSUE
IS
AN
ISSUE
OF
WISDOM
AND
VIRTUE
I
PERSONALLY
DONT
THINK
MAN
HAS
ENOUGH
WISDOM
AND
VIRTUE
TO
PULL
THIS
NEXT
CHALLENGE
OFF
ANY
BETTER
THAN
HE
DID
THE
FOR
LAST
FEW
WE
AS
EUGENISTS
MAY
MAKE
IT
AN
WE
MAY
NOT
IF
WE
DONT
I
HOPE
THERE
ARE
RESERVOIRS
OF
GARBAGE
PEOPLE
OUT
IN
SOME
BACKWATER
WITH
OTHERWISE
LONG
DISCARDED
GARBAGE
GENES
WHICH
WILL
PULL
US
THROUGH
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
REAL
PROBLEM
IS
AND
WILL
PROBABLY
ALWAYS
BE
THE
SAME
MAN
NEEDS
TO
ACCEPT
INPUT
FROM
THE
GREAT
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
TO
OVERCOME
HIS
LACKS
IN
THE
AREA
OF
KNOWING
HOW
TO
USE
THE
POWER
HE
HAS
SOME
MEN
HAVE
AND
I
BELIEVE
ALL
MEN
MAY
LISTEN
TO
AND
OBEY
THE
STILL
SMALL
VOICE
OF
GOD
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
THIS
IS
THE
WAY
TO
BEGIN
TO
RECIEVE
THE
WISDOM
AND
VIRTUE
NEEDED
TO
ESCAPE
THE
PROBLEMS
CONSEQUENT
TO
POOR
CHOICES
PEOPLES
HAVE
DIED
OUT
FOR
MANY
REASONS
THE
SOCIETIES
WHICH
FAILED
TO
ACCEPT
ENOUGH
INPUT
FROM
GOD
TO
SAFELY
USE
THE
POWER
THEY
HAD
DEVELOPED
HAVE
DESTROYED
THEMSELVES
AND
OFTEN
OTHERS
IN
THE
PROCESS
IT
IS
SELFEVIDENT
THAT
THE
ONES
WHICH
SURVIVE
TODAY
HAVE
EITHER
ACCEPTED
ENOUGH
INPUT
FROM
THE
SPIRIT
TO
USE
THEIR
POWERS
WISELY
ENOUGH
TO
AVOID
OR
SURVIVE
THEIR
OWN
MISTAKES
THUS
FAR
OR
ELSE
HAVENT
HAD
ENOUGH
POWER
FOR
LONG
ENOUGH
IN
SUMMARY
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
TO
USE
THIS
NEW
TECHNOLOGY
IS
REALLY
AN
ANCIENT
ONE
AND
THE
ANSWER
IN
SOME
WAYS
HARD
IN
SOME
WAYS
EASY
IS
THE
SAME
ANCIENT
ANSWER
IT
ISNT
THE
POWER
IT
IS
THE
SPIRIT
