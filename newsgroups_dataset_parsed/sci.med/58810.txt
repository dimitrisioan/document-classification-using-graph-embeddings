CASE
IN
POINT
MY
BROTHER
GOT
STUNG
BY
A
BEE
I
KNOW
HE
IS
ALLERGIC
TO
BEE
STINGS
BUT
THAT
HIS
REACTION
IS
SEVERE
LOCALIZED
SWELLING
NOT
ANAPHYLACTIC

COULD
NOT
CONVINCE
THE
DOCTORS
OF
THAT
HOWEVER
BECAUSE

NOT
WRITTEN
IN
THEIR

BOOK
OF

IS
REACTING
TO
A

WHY
WHEN
SOMEONE
EATS
SOMETHING
WITH

IMMEDIATELY
CONCLUDE

I

TO
FIND
OUT
THE
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
BAD
REACTIONS
TO
MSG
INCLUDING
HEADACHES
STOMACHACHES
AND
EVEN

ID
BE
SURPRISED
IF
SOME
OF
THESE
REACTIONS
WERENT
DUE
