ADVICE
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IS
HAVING
SOME
SYMPTOMS
AND
HAS
ASKED
ME
TO
POST
THE
FOLLOWING
INFORMATION
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
SHE
NOTICED
THAT
SOME
OF
HER
HAIR
WAS
STARTING
TO
FALL
OUT
SHE
WOULD
TOUCH
HER
HEAD
AND
STRANDS
OF
HAIR
WOULD
JUST
FALL
RIGHT
OUT
BY
THE
WAY
SHE
IS
OR
YEARS
OLD
IT
CONTINUED
TO
OCCUR
UNTIL
SHE
HAD
A
BALD
SPOT
ABOUT
THE
SIZE
OF
A
HALF
DOLLAR
SINCE
THAT
TIME
SHE
HAS
GOTTEN
TWO
MORE
BALD
SPOTS
OF
THE
SAME
SIZE
OTHER
SYMPTOMS
SHES
DESCRIBED
INCLUDE
SEVERAL
MONTHS
OF
AN
IRREGULAR
MENSTRUAL
CYCLE
WHICH
IS
STRANGE
FOR
HER
BECAUSE
SHE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
EXTREMELY
REGULAR
LARYNGITIS
EVERY
FEW
DAYS
SHE
WILL
WAKE
UP
ONE
MORNING
AND
HAVE
ALMOST
NO
VOICE
AND
THEN
THE
NEXT
DAY
ITS
FINE
DIZZY
SPELLS
SHE
CLAIMS
THAT
SHES
HAD
OR
VERY
BAD
DIZZY
SPELLS
EARLY
IN
THE
MORNING
INCLUDING
ONE
THAT
KNOCKED
HER
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
GENERAL
FATIGUE
SHE
WENT
TO
A
DERMATOLOGIST
FIRST
WHO
COULDNT
FIND
ANY
REASON
FOR
THE
SYMPTOMS
AND
SENT
HER

AN
INTERNIST
WHO
SUSPECTED
THYROID
PROBLEMS
HE
DID
THE
BLOOD
WORK
AND
CLAIMS
THAT
EVERYTHING
CAME
BACK
NORMAL
SHES
VERY
CONCERNED
AND
VERY
CONFUSED
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEAS
OR
SUGGESTIONS

TOLD
HER
THAT

THOUGHT

THAT
SOUND
LIKE
THE
RIGHT
IDEA

HAS
RECENTLY
TAKEN
ANY
MEDICATIONS
