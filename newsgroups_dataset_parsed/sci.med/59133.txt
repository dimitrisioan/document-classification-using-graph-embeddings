AND
TO
ADD
FURTHER
FUEL
TO
THE
FLAME
WAR
I
READ
ABOUT
YEARS
AGO
THAT
THE
NATURAL
MSG
EXTRACTED
FROM
THE
SOURCES
YOU
MENTION
ABOVE
DOES
NOT
CAUSE
THE
REPORTED
AFTEREFFECTS
ITS
ONLY
THAT
NASTY
ARTIFICIAL
MSG
EXTRACTED
FROM
COAL
TAR
OR
WHATEVER
THAT
CAUSES
CHINESE

SYNDROME
I
FIND
THIS
PRETTY
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
HEARD
IT
MSG
IS
MONO
SODIUM
GLUTAMATE
A
FAIRLY
STRAIGHT
FORWARD
COMPOUND
IF
IT
IS
PURE
THE
SOURCE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
A
PROBLEM
YOUR
COMMENT
SUGGESTS
THAT
IMPURITIES
MAY
BE
THE
CAUSE
MY
EXPERIENCE
OF
MSG
EFFECTS
AS
PART
OF
A
DOUBLE
BLIND
STUDY
WAS
THAT
THE
PURE
STUFF
CAUSED
ME
SOME
RATHER
SEVERE
EFFECTS
I
WAS
UNDER
THE
POSSIBLY
INCORRECT
ASSUMPTION
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
MSG
ON
OUR
FOODS
WAS
MADE
FROM
PROCESSING
SUGAR
BEETS
IS
THIS
NOT
TRUE
ARE
THERE
OTHER
SOURCES
OF
MSG
SOYA

CHEESES
MUSHROOMS

CONTAIN
MSG
I
AM
ONE
OF
THOSE
FOLX
WHO
REACT
SOMETIMES
STRONGLY
TO
MSG
HOWEVER
I
ALSO
REACT
STRONGLY
TO
SODIUM
CHLORIDE
TABLE
SALT
IN
EXCESS
EACH
CAUSES
DIFFERENT
SYMPTOMS
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
COMMON
ONE
OF
RAPID
HEARTBEAT
AND
AN
UNCOMFORTABLE
FEELING
OF
PRESSURE
IN
MY
CHEST
UPPER

QUADRANT
THE
SYMPTOMS
I
HAD
WERE
NUMBNESS
OF

MUSCLES
IN

FOLLOWED
BY
THE
ARMS

THE
LEGS
HEADACHE
LETHARGY
AND
UNABLE
TO

AWAKE
I
THINK
IT
MAY

AFFECT

DIFFERENTLY

I
THINK
MSG
IS
MADE
FROM
A
KIND
