hives
my
wife
had
hives
during
the
first
two
months
of
her
pregnancy
my
son
months
old
breastfed
now
has
the
same
symptoms
she
has
been
to
a
skinspecialist
but
he
has
merely
prescribed
various
medicines
one
each
visit
as
though
by
trial
and
error
antihistamines
worked
on
both
of
them
but
looks
like
becoming
less
effective
are
there
other
solutions
