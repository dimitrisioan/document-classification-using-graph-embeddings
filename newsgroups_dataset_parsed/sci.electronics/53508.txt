dumb
question
function
generator
i
have
a
new
scope
and
i
thought
id
save
a
few
bucks
by
buying
one
with
a
function
generator
built
in
after
having
it
awhile
i
noticed
two
things
about
the
function
generator
for
one
there
seems
to
be
a
bias
even
when
the
pulloffset
is
pushed
in
that
is
i
have
to
pull
that
know
and
adjust
it
to
get
a
signal
sans
some
random
bias
the
other
really
annoying
thing
is
that
the
damn
output
wont
go
below
about
pp
i
am
a
student
you
may
have
guessed
from
my
previous
posts
and
i
often
have
to
measure
the
input
impedances
of
various
circuits
i
buildmany
of
the
circuits
have
maximum
input
signals
of
way
less
than
amplitude
and
most
have
input
impedances
in
the
of
kohm
range
the
thing
is
in
order
to
use
my
function
generator
i
have
to
divide
the
voltage
to
some
thing
reasonable
then
of
course
to
measurethe
input
impedance
of
my
circuit
i
am
going
to
have
to
throw
in
another
resistor
in
series
with
the
output
of
the
generator
i
could
just
ignore
it
but
now
with
this
little
divider
there
i
have
to
figure
that
in
its
kind
of
a
pain
in
the
ass
is
there
any
way
i
could
make
myself
a
little
box
that
could
solve
this
little
problem
the
box
would
tkae
the
function
generator
input
lower
the
voltage
and
give
an
output
impedance
that
is
some
low
unchanging
number
i
would
want
to
lower
the
voltage
by
a
factor
of
one
hundred
or
so
i
could
just
build
a
little
buffer
amp
but
id
like
to
have
this
box
not
be
active
any
quick
ideas
the
scopes
not
broken
for
other
reasons
i
had
sent
it
to
the
shop
to
get
repaired
and
they
replaced
it
the
function
generator
was
the
same
way
on
that
one
too
please
help
as
i
am
feeling
very
stupid
today
