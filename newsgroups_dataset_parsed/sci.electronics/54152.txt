RE
LASER
VS
BUBBLEJET
HERE
IS
A
DIFFERENT
VIEWPOINT
FYI
THE
ACTUAL
HORIZONTAL
DOT
PLACEMENT
RESOUTION
OF
AN
HP
DESKJET
IS
INCH
THE
ELECTRONICS
AND
DYNAMICS
OF
THE
INK
CARTRIDGE
HOWEVER
LIMIT
YOU
TO
GENERATING
DOTS
AT
PER
INCH
ON
ALMOST
ANY
PAPER
THE
INK
WICKS
MORE
THAN
INCH
ANYWAY
THE
METHOD
OF
DEPOSITING
AND
FUSING
TONER
OF
A
LASTER
PRINTER
RESULTS
IN
MUCH
LESS
SPREAD
THAN
INK
DROP
TECHNOLOGY
IN
PRACTICE
THERE
IS
LITTLE
DIFFERENCE
IN
QUALITY
BUT
MORE
CARE
IS
NEEDED
WITH
INKJET
BECAUSE
SMUDGES
ETC
CAN
HAPPEN
IT
DOESNT
TAKE
MUCH
INVESTIGATION
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
MECHANICAL
AND
ELECTRONIC
COMPLEMENT
OF
A
LASER
PRINTER
IS
MORE
COMPLEX
THAN
INEXPENSIVE
INK
JET
PRINTERS
RECALL
ALSO
THAT
LASER
PRINTERS
OFFER
A
MUCH
HIGHER
THROUGHPUT
PPM
FOR
A
LASER
VERSUS
ABOUT
PPM
FOR
AN
INK
JET
PRINTER
A
CHEAP
LASER
PRINTER
DOES
NOT
MANAGE
THAT
SORT
OF
THROUGHPUT
AND
ON
TOP
OF
THAT
HOW
LONG
DOES
THE
FIRST
SHEET
TAKE
TO
PRINT
INKJETS
ARE
FASTER
THAN
YOU
SAY
AND
IN
BOTH
CASES
THE
COMPUTER
OFTEN
HAS
TROUBLE
KEEPING
UP
WITH
THE
PRINTER
I
HAVE
A
AND
A
LOT
OF
DRIVERS
CANNOT
KEEP
UP
WITH
THE
PRINTER
A
SAGE
SAID
TO
ME
DO
YOU
WANT
ONE
COPY
OR
LOTS
OF
COPIES
ONE
INKJET
SOMETHING
ELSE
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IS
THE
COST
OF
CONSUMABLES
OVER
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
PRINTER
A
PAGE
YIELD
TONER
CARTRIDGE
IS
ABOUT
US
AT
DISCOUNT
WHILE
HP
HIGH
CAPACITY
PAGE
YIELD
CARTRIDGES
ARE
ABOUT
US
AT
DISCOUNT
IT
COULD
BE
THAT
OVER
THE
LIFE
CYCLE
OF
THE
PRINTER
THAT
CONSUMABLES
FOR
LASER
PRINTERS
ARE
LESS
THAN
INK
JET
PRINTERS
IT
IS
GETTING
PROGRESSIVELY
CLOSER
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
TECHNOLOGIES
LASER
PRINTERS
ARE
USUALLY
DESINGED
FOR
HIGHER
DUTY
CYCLES
IN
PAGES
PER
MONTH
AND
LONGER
PRODUCT
REPLACEMENT
CYCLES
PAPER
COST
IS
THE
SAME
AND
BOTH
CAN
USE
REFILLS
LONG
TERM
THE
LASERPRINTER
WILL
NEED
SOME
EXPENSIVE
REPLACEMENT
PARTS
CONSUMABLES
AND
ON
TOP
OF
THAT
ARE
THE
AMORTISATION
COSTS
WHICH
FAVOUR
THE
LOWEST
PURCHASE
COST
PRINTER
HP
INKJETS
UNDERSTAND
PCL
SO
IN
MANY
CASES
A
LASERJET
DRIVER
WILL
WORK
IF
THE
SOFTWARE
PACKAGE
HAS
NO
INKJET
DRIVER
THERE
IS
ONE
WILD
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
PRINTERS
A
LASERPRINTER
IS
A
PAGE
PRINTER
WHILST
AN
INKJET
IS
A
LINE
PRINTER
THIS
MEANS
THAT
A
LASERPRINTER
CAN
ROTATE
GRAPHIC
IMAGES
WHILST
AN
INKJET
CANNOT
FEW
DRIVERS
ACTUALLY
USE
THIS
FACILITY
THERE
IS
ALSO
THE
MATTER
OF
DOWNLOADABLE
FONTS
AND
