I
AM
TRYING
TO
BUILD
A
SYNCHRONOUS
DEMODULATOR
AND
IVE
HIT
A
SNAG
IN
MY
APPLICATION
I
WANT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
CHANGE
THE
GAIN
OF
AN
OP
AMP
AMPLIFIER
FROM
TO
CONTROLABLE
VIA
A
DIGITAL
INPUT
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
WAY
IVE
COME
UP
WITH
IS
TO
USE
ANALOG
SWITCHES
TO
ADJUST
THE
GAIN
OF
THE
OP
AMP
THE
ONLY
ANALOG
SWITCH
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
IT
THE
UNFORTUNATELY
I
WANT
TO
SWITCH
AN
AC
SIGNAL
WHICH
GOES
FROM
ABOUT
TO
AND
THE
IS
ONLY
FOR
POSITIVE
SIGNALS
I
HAVE
A
CARRIER
SIGNAL
WHICH
VARIES
BETWEEN
AND
I
WANT
TO
DEMODULATE
AN
INPUT
SIGNAL
BY
FEEDING
THE
INPUT
SIGNAL
THRU
A
AMP
WITH
A
GAIN
OF
WHEN
THE
CARRIER
IS
AT
AND
THRU
A
AMP
WITH
A
GAIN
OF
WHEN
THE
CARRIER
IS
THE
OUTPUT
IS
THEN
LOW
PASS
FILTERED
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
CALLED
LOCK
IN
DETECTION
AS
WELL
AS
SYNCHRONOUS
DEMODULATION
LOOK

ANALOG

THE
