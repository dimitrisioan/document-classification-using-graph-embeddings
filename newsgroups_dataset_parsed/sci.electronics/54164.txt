RE
HOW
TO
THE
DISKS
COPY
PROTECTED
I
THINK
A
FEW
THINGS
ARE
BEING
MISSED
OVERALL
HERE
FIRST
OF
ALL
ANYONE
WITH
A
DOS
MANUAL
CAN
COPY
A
DISK
OR
COPY
ANYTHING
HIDDEN
FILES
DONT
GO
FAR
IF
YOU
ARE
DEALING
WITH
ANYONE
WHO
IS
NOT
COMLETELY
DOS
IGNORANT
OFF
OF
A
HARD
DISK
PROFESSIONAL
CRACKERS
ARENT
INTERESTED
IN
COPYING
DISKS
THEY
ARE
PROGRAMMERS
WHO
GET
SOME
THRILL
OUT
OF
GOING
THROUGH
UNASSEMBLY
LISTINGS
OF
PROGRAMS
TO
DISABLE
COPY
PROTECTION
SUCH
AS
SERIAL
NUMBER
DIALOG
BOXES
VOLUME
LABEL
CHECKS
AND
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
COMPUTER
GAMES
THOSE
PEOPLE
ARE
IN
THE
MINORITY
HOWEVER
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THE
WORLD
OF
PEOPLE
AND
SOFTWARE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
A
GOOD
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
SAY
WILL
AT
SOME
POINT
COPY
A
FRIENDS
PROGRAM
GEE
YOU
REALLY
OUGHTA
TRY
THIS
OR
ACCEPT
A
COPY
THESE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
NORMALLY
WOULD
BUY
A
SOFTWARE
PACKAGE
OR
DO
WITHOUT
BUT
DECIDED
THAT
JUST
ONCE
IT
WOULDNT
MATTER
THE
LAST
THING
IS
PEOPLE
WHO
OWN
OR
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
MORE
THAN
ONE
COMPUTER
MOST
PEOPLE
ARENT
GOING
TO
SPEND
X
OF
COMPUTERS
FOR
THE
SAME
SOFTWARE
PACKAGE
THEY
WILL
JUST
INSTALL
IT
X
OF
TIMES
ESPECIALLY
THINGS
LIKE
DOS
UPGRADES
ARE
WE
HAVING
FUN
YET
