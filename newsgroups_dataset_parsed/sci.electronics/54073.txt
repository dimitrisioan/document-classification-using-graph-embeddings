WHY
DOES
A
LEAD
ACID
BATTERY
DISCHARGE
AND
BECOME
DEAD
TOTALLY
UNUSEABLE
WHEN
STORED
ON
A
CONCRETE
FLOOR
I
DECIDED
TO
BRING
THE
BATTERY
IN
FROM
THE
LAWN
MOWER
AND
THE
MOTORCYCLE
FROM
THE
UNHEATED
GARAGE
THIS
YEAR
TO
PRESERVE
THEM
AND
I
JUST
WENT
TO
USE
THEM
AND
NOTICED
THAT
NOT
ONLY
DO
THEY
NOT
WORK
BUT
THEY
ACT
LIKE
THE
TWO
TERMINALS
ARE
SHORTED
I
ASKED
A
FRIEND
AND
HE
SAID
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
NEVER
DO
THAT
CAUSE
IT
RUINS
THEM
BUT
HE
COULDNT
TELL
ME
WHY
THIS
TOPIC
WAS
BEATEN
TO
DEATH
A
YEAR
OR
SO
AGO
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
WAS
FOR
ADVICE
ON
HIS
PROBLEM
NOT
A
HISTORY
LESSON
I
THINK
THAT
IF
THIS
QUESTION
COMES
UP
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
THEN
PEOPLE
SHOULD
GET
A
CIVIL
ANSWER
THE
CONCRETE
IS
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
LEADACID
BATTERIES
OFTEN
FAIL
FROM
DISUSE
NOT
BEING
CHARGED
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BUT
THERES
NO
WAY
THE
CONCRETE
FLOOR
COULD
BE
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
COULD
ANYONE
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
WHAT
HAPPENS
WITH
A
BATTERY
AND
IS
THERE
ANY
CURE
TO
GET
IT
BACK
INTO
LIFE
