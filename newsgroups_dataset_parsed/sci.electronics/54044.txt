why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
it
could
be
that
you
stored
it
somewhere
that
it
could
become
covered
by
moisture
or
damp
air
which
would
short
out
the
terminals
the
same
thing
happens
to
my
car
citroen
damp
gets
under
the
bonnet
us
hood
and
shorts
the
sparkplugs
to
earth
so
it
wont
start
the
solution
for
the
car
is
to
clean
the
plug
leads
and
spray
with
moisture
repellant
if
damp
is
the
problem
then
storing
the
battery
off
the
ground
may
help
im
not
sure
if
spraying
with
would
be
safe
since
it
is
very
flammable
high
percentage
petroleum
just
a
thought
