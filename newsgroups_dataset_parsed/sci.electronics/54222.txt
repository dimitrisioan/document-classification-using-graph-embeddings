i
was
wondering
if
people
had
any
good
uses
for
old
simms
i
have
a
bunch
of
them
for
the
apple
mac
and
i
know
lots
of
other
people
do
to
i
have
tried
to
sell
them
but
have
gotten
no
interest
well
if
youre
willing
to
spend
a
little
money
you
could
buy
one
of
those
ide
caching
controllers
assuming
you
have
an
ide
of
course
and
put
the
simms
on
them
hardware
