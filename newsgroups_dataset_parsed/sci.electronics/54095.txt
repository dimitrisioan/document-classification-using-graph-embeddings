when
constructing
active
filters
odd
values
of
resistor
are
often
required
ie
something
like
a
k
ohm
resistorit
seems
best
to
choose
common
capacitor
values
and
cope
with
the
strange
resistances
then
demanded
is
there
a
pd
program
out
there
that
will
work
out
how
best
to
make
up
such
a
resistance
given
fixed
resistors
of
the
standard
values
per
etc
it
is
a
common
enough
problem
yet
i
cant
recall
seing
a
program
that
tells
that
rxryrz
gives
rq
starting
with
q
and
finding
prefered
values
xy
and
z

when
trying
to
choose
a
resistor
with
a
tolerance
better
than
you
need
a
trimmer
or
to
screen
devices
it
cant
be
made
from
adding
resitors
of
value
in
parallel
since
the
smaller
device
will
have
the
error
of
to
cope
with
you
have
choices
a
live
with
the
error
of
tolerance
devices
for
low
q
circuits
or
low
sensitivity
designs
b
buy
resistors
with
better
than
tolerance
