a
question
about
outlet
wiring

hmmm
how
are
those
orange
isolated
ground
outlets
often
used
in
computer
rooms
wired
they
require
two
separate
grounds
one
ground
goes
to
the
ground
pin
of
the
outlet
and
the
other
ground
wire
is
connected
to
the
outlets
mounting
tabs
and
thus
grounds
the
box
and
faceplate
screw
and
metal
faceplate
if
any
the
boxfaceplate
ground
goes
to
the
normal
distribution
panel
ground
the
outlet
groundpin
wire
is
generally
connected
to
an
insulated
busbar
in
the
distribution
panel
which
is
in
turn
connected
to
the
buildingentrance
main
ground
by
its
own
wire
so
the
two
separate
ground
systems
are
connected
together
at
the
buildings
service
entrance
but
one
is
also
connected
to
every
grounded
piece
of
electrical
equipment
in
the
whole
building
while
the
isolated
ground
is
shared
only
by
the
equipment
plugged
into
isolatedground
outlets
of
that
panel
if
someone
happens
to
accidentally
short
one
phase
of
a
feeder
to
ground
the
main
building
ground
is
likely
to
have
a
lot
of
noise
on
it
until
the
breaker
trips
or
the
fuse
blows
while
the
isolated
ground
will
remain
relatively
noisefree
