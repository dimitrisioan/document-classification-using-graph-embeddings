RE
LASER
VS
BUBBLEJET
KOLSTADCAEWISCEDU
JOEL
KOLSTAD
WRITES
ONE
OTHER
THING
THERE
ARE
BUBBLEJETS
AND
THEN
THERE
ARE
BUBBLEJETS
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
BUBBLEJETS
OUT
THERE
THAT
PRODUCE
RATHER
MEDIOCRE
OUTPUT
SUCH
AS
HPS
DINKY
LITTLE
BUBBLEJET
WHEREAS
MOST
PRODUCE
REALLY
GOOD
LOOKING
OUTPUT
SUCH
AS
HPS
DESKJETS
IBM
AND
CANON
BOTH
PRODUCE
SOME
OF
THE
REALLY
GOOD
STYLE
BUBBLEJETS
PS
IF
YOURE
IN
THE
MARKET
FOR
A
PORTABLE
BUBBLEJET
PRINTER
I
CAN
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
THE
HP
PORTABLE
DESKJET
ALTHOUGH
IVE
HEARD
THE
PORTABLE
CANONS
ARE
GOOD
TOO
I
NEEDED
PCL
SUPPORT
MYSELF
WITH
THE
DESKJET
PORTABLE
YOU
EVEN
GET
AN
UNDOCUMENTED
PCMCIA
CARD
SLOT
I
SECOND
THAT
SUGGESTION
ALTHOUGH
I
DONT
OWN
THE
HP
PORTABLE
DESKJET
I
DO
OWN
THE
HP
DESKJET
IT
GIVES
THE
NICEST
OUTPUTS
WITH
ONLY
A
MINOR
LOSS
OF
QUALITY
FOR
ALL
INTENSIVE
PURPOSES
PAPERS
LETTERS
RESUMES
I
TREAT
MY
DESKJET
LIKE
A
LASER
PRINTER
YOU
DO
HAVE
TO
LOOK
A
BIT
CLOSELY
TO
SEE
THE
BLURS
IN
THE
CHARACTERS
ONLY
ONE
GRUDGE
THE
INK
THAT
HP
GIVES
YOU
DOES
SMUDGE
RATHER
QUICKLY
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
MOISTURE
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
INK
IS
WATERPROOF
HOWEVER
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SPEND
ABOUT
MORE
FOR
LASER
QUALITY
THE
CANNON
BUBBLEJETS
ARE
NICE
HOWEVER
THEY
DONT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
AS
MUCH
SUPPORT
EG
DRIVERS
FOR
POPULAR
PROGRAMS
AS
THE
HP
INKJETS
ALSO
HP
DESKJET
ACCEPTS
XEROX
PAPER
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CUTSHEET
FEEDER
IS
AN
OPTION
FOR
THE
CANNON
BUBBLEJET
IF
YOU
DONT
MIND
REFILLING
YOUR
PRINTER
WITH
CHEAP
INK
SAY
FOUNTAINPEN
INK
THEN
THE
HP
DESKJETS
ARE
VERY
CHEAP
TO
MAINTAIN
I
PAID
FOR
MY
LAST
BOTTLE
OF
INK
AND
I
EXPECT
IT
TO
LAST
MONTHS
KIMBALL
WHO
DOESNT
WORK
FOR
HP
BUT
JUST
LOVES
HIS
PRINTER
VERY
MUCH
PS
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
FOR
YOU
NETTERS
IM
TOO
AFRAID
TO
REFILL
WITH
THE
WATERPROOF
INKS
THEY
SELL
IN
ARTSUPPLY
HOUSES
BECAUSE
I
HAD
BROUGHT
A
BOTTLE
OF
WATERPROOF
INK
AND
IT
CLOGGED
UP
MY
CARTRIDGE
I
WONDER
WHAT
IS
A
GOOD
WATERPROOF
INK
ASIDE
FROM
BUYING
REFILLKITS
TO
REFILL
MY
CARTRIDGE
