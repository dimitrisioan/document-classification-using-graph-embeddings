is
there
a
readily
available
solvent
that
does
a
good
job
at
removing
the
corrosionencrustation
that
collects
on
the
battery
terminals
usually
the
cathode
when
using
alkaline
batteries
or
more
accurately
when
not
using
them
for
a
long
time
generally
the
corrosion
is
a
signal
that
its
time
to
send
them
of
to
the
recyclers
but
if
youre
that
desperate
or
cheap
try
baking
soda
and
a
wire
brush
use
gloves
and
goggles
please
sorry
i
meant
the
terminals
in
the
device
not
on
the
batteries
which
are
obviously
quite
dead
