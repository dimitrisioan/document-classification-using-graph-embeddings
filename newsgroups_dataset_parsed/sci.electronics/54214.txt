WRITES
WHAT
KIND
OF
POWER
MUST
HE
BE
PUTTING
OUT
TO
CAUSE
THE
EFFECTS
THE
AFFECTED
EQUIPMENT
IS
ABOUT
FEET
FROM
THE
ROAD
MIGHT
BE
A
COUPLE
OF
HUNDRED
WATTS
FROM
THE
SOUND
OF
IT
KICKING
SOUND
OUT
OF
THE
TV
AND
STEREO
SPEAKERS
BY
DIRECT
RF
RECTIFICATION
REQUIRES
A
MIGHTY
STRONG
CARRIER
IVE
HEARD
OF
LINEARS
SO
POWERFUL
THAT
TRIGGERING
THEM
WHILE
THE
CAR
WAS
IDLING
WOULD
STALL
THE
ENGINE
BY
PULLING
DOWN
THE
BATTERY
VOLTAGE
IT
WOULD
TAKE
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THAT
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
THE
RADIO
EQUIPMENT
IS
ACTUALLY
NOT
SHUT
COMPLETELY
OFF
BUT
JUST
GOES
TO
A
STANDBY
SITUATION
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
STORIES
ARE
JUST
THAT
STORIES
THE
VOLTAGE
CAN
ONLY
BE
SUCKED
DOWN
SO
FAR
INSTANTANEOUSLY
WHEN
YOU
TRY
TO
JUMPSTART
SOMEONES
CAR
WHEN
YOUR
VEHICLE
IS
AT
IDLE
DOES
YOUR
CAR
STALL
NO
THE
OTHER
CAR
JUST
DOES
NOT
CRANK
WELL
NOW
THE
ENGINE
MIGHT
STALL
BECAUSE
THE
IDLE
WAS
TOO
LOW
TO
START
WITH
WHEN
THE
EXTRA
CURRENT
IS
DRAWN
THE
IDLE
SPEED
WILL
DROP
AS
THE
ALTERNATOR
LOADS
DOWN
THE
ENGINE
TO
COMPENSATE
FOR
THE
INCREASED
AMPERAGE
REQUIREMENT
IS
RESOLUTION
OF
THIS
PROBLEM
A
MATTER
FOR
THE
POWER
COMPANY
THE
FCC
OR
BOTH
ULTIMATELY
ITS
LIKELY
TO
BE
YOUR
PROBLEM
TO
RESOLVE
IM
AFRAID
THE
FCC
IS
SO
UNDERSTAFFED
THAT
THEY
DONT
PAY
MUCH
ATTENTION
TO
CITIZEN
COMPLAINS
ABOUT
RFI
OR
SO
IVE
HEARD
THEYLL
JUST
SEND
YOU
A
PAMPHLET
DESCRIBING
HOW
YOU
CAN
APPLY
CORRECTIVE
MEASURES
TALKING
TO
THE

COMPANY
MIGHT
HELP
THEY
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
INSTALL
FILTERING
DEVICES
AT
YOUR
SERVICE
PANEL
OR
RECOMMEND
A
TYPE
WHICH
YOU
COULD
HAVE
INSTALLED
BY
A
LICENSED
ELECTRICIAN
A
TRANSMITTER
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
AFFECTING
HOUSE
POWER
IF
SURGES
ARE
OCCURRING
THERE
IT
IS
DUE
TO
ANOTHER
CAUSE
NOT
A
TRANSMITTER
UNFORTUNATELY
THERES
A
FAIR
CHANCE
THAT
ENOUGH
SIGNAL
IS
BEING
PICKED
UP
BY
YOUR
HOUSE
WIRING
THAT
A
SIMPLE
SERVICEPANEL
FILTER
WONT
SUFFICE
YOU
MAY
NEED
TO
INSTALL
HEAVYDUTY
RFI
FILTERS
AT
THE

CONNECTIONS
OF
YOUR
AFFECTED

IT
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
THAT
MUCH
OF
A
PROBLEM
OFTEN
TOROID
COILS
ON
THE
POWER
LEADS
WILL
SOLVE
THAT
PART
OF
THE
INTERFERENCE
PROBLEM
IT
WILL
NOT
SOLVE
INTERNAL
EQUIPMENT
DEFICIENCIES
IF
THE
PROBLEM
OCCURS
REGULARLY
YOU
MAY
NEED
TO
STAKE
OUT
THE
STREET
IN
QUESTION
AND
WATCH
FOR
TRUCKS
OR
CARS
WITH
BIG
ANTENNAE
DRIVING
BY
AT
THE
TIME
INTERFERENCE
OCCURS
IF
YOU
CAN
IDENTIFY
THE
VEHICLE
WHICH
IS
TRANSMITTING
YOU
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
CONTACT
ITS
OWNER
AND
COMPLAIN
IT
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
THE
TRANSMITTER
THAT
IS
AT
FAULT
IF
THE
PERSON
IS
AN
AMATEUR
THEN
HESHE
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
WILLING
TO
HELP
IF
YOU
EXPLAIN
THAT
THE
