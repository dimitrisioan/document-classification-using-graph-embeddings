QUESTION
ABOUT
OUTLET
WIRING
OLSENVETMEDCVMUIUCEDU
AARTOLSEN
WRITES
I
NOTICED
AT
THE
FUSEBOX
THAT
SOME
CIRCUITS
HAVE
THE
WITH
GROUND
AND
THAT
ON
THESE
CIRCUITS
THE
GROUND
WIRE
WAS
TIED
TO
THE
SAME
BUS
AS
THE
NEUTRAL
WHITE
WIRE
THIS
IS
CONTRARY
TO
THE
ELECTRICAL
CODE
AND
SHOULD
BE
FIXED
SORRY
BUT
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NEC
NO
NEED
TO
BE
SORRY
I
BLEW
IT
ON
THIS
ONE
AT
THE
MAIN
BREAKER
BOX
WHERE
THERE
IS
A
THICK
WIRE
GROUND
LEADING
TO
THE
EARTH
BOTH
NEUTRAL
AND
GROUND
ARE
HOOKED
TO
THIS
BUS
IN
ANY
OTHER
BREAKER
BOX
OR
AN
OUTLET
BOX
ETC
THE
GROUND
AND
NEUTRAL
MUST
NOT
BE
CONNECTED
TOGETHER
