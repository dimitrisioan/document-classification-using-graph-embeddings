CHRIS
BEST
WRITES
IM
NO
EXPERT
AT
UPSS
BUT
YOU
SAID
SOMETHING
THAT
MADE
IT
SOUND
LIKE
YOU
DIDNT
REALIZE
SOMETHING
ON
A
TYPICAL
UPS
WELL
ON
OURS
ANYWAY
THERE
IS
NO
SWITCHOVER
FROM
AC
TO
DC
ALL
THE
PROTECTED
EQUIPMENT
IS
ALWAYS
RUNNING
FROM
THE
BATTERIES
VIA
AN
INVERTER
WITH
THE
USUAL
CONDITION
OF
ALSO
HAVING
THEM
ON
CHARGE
IF
THE
POWER
FAILS
BIG
DEAL
THE
COMPUTERS
NEVER
SEE
IT
UNTIL
THE
BATTERIES
START
TO
DROOP
BUT
THERES
SOMETHING
LIKE
CARSIZED
BATTERIES
IN
THAT
CABINET
SO
IT
TAKES
A
WHILE
IF
YOU
WERE
GONNA
RUN
THE
GUTS
ON
STRAIGHT
DC
INSTEAD
OF
AN
INVERTER
WHY
NOT
DO
IT
ALL
THE
TIME
THEN
THERED
BE
NO
SWITCHOVER
TO
SCREW
THINGS
UP
AND
NO
HAVING
TO
SENSE
THE
FAILURE
FAST
JUST
KEEP
THE
DC
ON
CHARGE
WHEN
THE
POWER
IS
ON
AND
ITLL
BE
THERE
IN
ZERO
TIME
WHEN
YOU
NEED
IT
ACTUALLY
ITS
A
BIT
MORE
COMPLICATED
THAN
THATI
SOUNDS
TO
ME
YOUR
UPS
TAKES
IN
AC
RECTIFIES
IT
TO
DC
TO
CHARGE
THE
BATTERIES
AND
THEN
TAKES
THE
BATTERY
DC
AND
CHOPS
IT
TO
AC
AGAIN
FEEDING
YOUR
EQUIPMENT
THIS
APPROACH
IS
THE
EASIEST
AND
CLEANEST
WAY
TO
SWITCHOVER
FROM
THE
MAINS
TO
BATTERY
ONCE
YOUR
POWER
KICKS
OUT
SINCE
AS
YOU
MENTIONED
NOTHING
WILL
KNOW
ABOUT
WHAT
HAPPENED
DOWN
THE
LINE
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
DO
THE
UPS
SCHEME
IS
TO
USE
THE
MAINS
UNTIL
YOU
LOSE
POWER
AND
THEN
KICK
IN
THE
BATTERY
BACKUP
WITH
ITS
INVERTER
TO
REPLACE
THE
LOST
POWER
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
THE
SWITCHOVER
TIME
AND
YOUVE
GOT
TO
RESYNC
THE
AC
IN
NO
TIME
FLAT
UNFORTUNATELY
MOST
EVERYTHING
IS
BUILT
AROUND
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
AC
IS
AVAILABLE
SO
THE
UPS
GUYS
HAVE
TO
PROVIDE
AND
AC
OUTPUT
TO
BE
USABLEYA
SORTA
HAVE
TO
MAKE
IT
WORK
WITH
WHAT
THERE
ALREADY
SIMILAR
STORY
WITH
OUR
TELEPHONE
SYSTEM
IT
WAS
FIRST
INVENTED
BACK
IN
THE
WERE
STILL
USING
THE
SAME
DAMN
SYSTEM
MEDIA
AS
THEY
DID
BACK
THEN
IF
I
HAVE
A
PHONE
FROM
BACK
THEN
I
CAN
ASSURE
YOU
ITLL
WORK
ON
TODAYS
PHONE
SYSTEM
IT
COSTS
TOO
MUCH
TO
OVERHAUL
EVERYONE
TO
A
NEW
SYSTEM
SO
THEY
MAKE
IT
WORK
WITH
WHAT
IS
OUT
THERE
