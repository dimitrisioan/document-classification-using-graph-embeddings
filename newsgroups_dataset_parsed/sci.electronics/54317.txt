WRITES
WHAT
I
USUALLY
USEAND
THIS
STUFF
IS
ONLY
GOOD
ON
GLASSIS
EITHER
ACETONE
OR
A
LITTLE
BENZENE
THE
LATTER
OF
THE
TWO
IS
A
BIT
DANGEROUS
POSSIBLY
A
CARCINOGENSP
BUT
IT
USUALY
GETS
THE
JOB
DONE
I
IMAGINE
YOU
CAN
YOU
THE
TWO
SOLVENTS
ON
MOST
METALS
AS
WELL
AS
GLASS
BUT
KEEP
THE

AWAY
FROM
PLASTIC
BENZENE
IS
MOST
DEFINITELY
A
CARCINOGEN
IF
YOU
CAN
GET
YOUR
HANDS
ON
