TDWHAT
TDIS
A
GOOD
CHOICE
FOR
A
CB
OR
WAVE
TD
I
READ
THE
INSTALLATION
INSTRUCTIONS
ON
A
WAVE
ANTENNA
TDAND
THEY
SUGGESTED
THAT
I
USE
AN
SWR
TO
TUNE
IT
AT
CHANNEL
TDAND
CHANNEL
FOR
A
MINIMUM
READING
QUESTION
IS
WHY
CHANNEL
AND
THE
BEST
ANTENNA
IS
ONE
THAT
WILL
LET
OUT
THE
MOST
WAVE
PROBABLY
NOT
THE
BEST
EXPLANATION
BUT
THE
REST
MAKES
SENSE
A
ONE
WAVE
WILL
CANCELL
ITSELF
OUT
BTW
NO
SUCH
BEASTIE
THE
BEST
IS
A
WAVE
ANTENNA
FOLLOWED
BY
THEN
ETC
AS
FOR
SWRING
IN
WHAT
YOU
ACTUALLY
DO
IS
TRIM
THE
ANTENNA
TO
THE
CORRECT
LENGTH
FOR
THE
SPECIFIC
WAVELENGTH
YOU
WILL
BE
TRANSMITTING
ON
SINCE
THE
WAVELENGTH
VARIES
WITH
THE
CHANNEL
YOU
USE
THEN
ITS
RECOMMENDED
TO
SWR
IN
USING
THE
MIDDLE
CHANNEL
OF
THOSE
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
USE
ANYWAY
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
CBS
ALL
NEW
ANTENNAS
HAD
TO
BE
SWRED
IN
NOWDAYS
MANUFACTURES
TRIM
THE
ANTENNAS
ALMOST
SPOT
ON
SO
THAT
THERES
NOT
MUCH
POINT
IN
SWRING
THEN
AGAIN
YOU
MAY
BE
A
FANATIC
AND
WHISH
TO
DO
IT
ANYWAY
