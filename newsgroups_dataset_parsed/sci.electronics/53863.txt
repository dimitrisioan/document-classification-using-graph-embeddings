does
it
work

hello
let
me
introduce
a
problem
when
i
measure
a
sinusoidal
wave
voltage
with
a
digital
voltmeter
using
ac
mode
my
output
is
an
rms
value
a
peak
value
over
squared
right
when
i
measure
a
square
wave
in
the
same
mode
ac
my
output
is
equal
to
a
peak
value
actually
to
the
upper
flat
boundary
of
the
wave
i
assumed
that
a
digital
voltmeter
makes
some
kind
of
integration
of
the
input
value
and
divides
it
over
the
wave
period
right
now
i
used
it
to
measure
the
same
square
wave
as
above
but
distorted
by
highfrequency
harmonics
ideally
output
should
be
the
same
but
the
output
value
was
only
about
of
the
previous
one
why
what
is
the
nature
of
this
output
value
what
does
the
voltmeter
actually
measure
and
what
does
it
show
re
rms
readings
unless
the
dvm
says
its
measuring
rms
its
probably
average
voltage
the
input
is
diode
rectified
and
measured
as
dc
if
it
says
its
rms
and
but
measures
squaretriangleetc
incorrectly
its
measuring
average
and
multipling
by
a
correction
thats
only
true
for
sine
waves
ie
vrms
if
you
want
correct
rms
for
most
any
waveform
you
need
a
truerms
dvmdmm
which
literally
does
the
rootmeansquare
calculation
in
either
analog
or
digital
circuitry
related
question
less
important
to
me
what
are
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
digital
voltmeters
to
compare
with
analog
ones
the
last
significant
advantage
of
analog
imo
was
being
able
to
see
the
signal
if
it
was
changing
over
time
eg
checking
electrolytic
capacitors
anymore
most
dmm
have
bargraphs
etc
that
duplicate
this
thank
you
for
your
attention
you
could
mail
me
your
opinion
at
or
open
a
discussion
here
i
would
appreciate
either
way
