obtain
the
service
manual
for
the
oscilloscope
and
adjust
the
internal
output
offset
contorl
there
is
virtual
certainty
that
there
is
an
internal
ajustment
for
the
offset
controls
zero
detent
position
verify
that
the
function
generator
is
properly
loaded
many
generators
expect
you
to
supply
a
ohm
load
go
to
a
hamfest
flea
market
and
scrounge
around
for
a
passthrough
ohm
terminator
that
has
a
male
and
female
bnc
or
whatever
connector
on
it
the
calibrator
on
my
tektronix
scope
is
designed
to
put
out
into
a
meg
load
but
volt
into
a
ohm
load
you
may
also
find
that
loading
the
output
of
the
function
generator
also
reduces
the
harmonic
distortion
build
an
attenuator
you
dont
have
to
use
and
i
wouldnt
want
to
use
the
input
impedance
of
the
device
under
test
as
part
of
the
voltage
divider
to
drop
the
input
test
voltage
consider
this
ohm
gen
ohm
dut
loaded
think
about
the
ratio
of
and
then
think
about
the
accuracy
to
which
you
can
read
voltages
on
your
oscilloscope
you
can
virtually
discount
the
loading
of
the
dut
also
you
have
the
millivolt
test
generator
you
want
good
luck
