AGO
SOMEONE
POSTED
AN
ARTICLE
TELLING
WHEN
AND
WHERE
A
HAMFEST
AND
COMPUTERFEST
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
HELP
IN
DAYTON
OH
UNFORTUNATELY
I
LOST
THE
ARTICLE
AND
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
SOMEONE
COULD
REPOST
IT
I
BELIEVE
IT
WAS
BEING
HELD
THE
OF
THIS
MONTH
AT
THE
DAYTON
CONVENTION
CENTER
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
ANY
HELP
AND
MORE

WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
