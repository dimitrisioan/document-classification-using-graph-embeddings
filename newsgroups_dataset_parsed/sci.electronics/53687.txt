I
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
THOSE
MASSIVE
CONCRETE
CYLINDERS
THAT
ARE
EVER
PRESENT
AT
NUCLEAR
POER
SITES
THEY
LOOK
LIKE
CYLINDERS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
PINCHED
IN
THE
MIDDLE
DOES
ANYBODY
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ACTUAL
PURPOSE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
ARE
I
HEAR
THAT
THEYRE
CALLED
COOLING
TOWERS
BUT
WHAT
THE
HECK
DO
THEY
COOL
I
HOPE
SOMEONE
CAN
HELP
THE
ACTUAL
HOURGLASS
IS
HOLLOW
AND
IS
DESIGNED
TO
GENERATE
A
DRAFT
EXPLOITING
THE
VENTURI
EFFECT
AROUND
THE
BASE
OF
THE
HOURGLASS
IS
A
RING
OF
WATER
TOWERS
WARM
RIVER
WATER
COMING
FROM
THE
STEAM
CONDENSER
IN
THE
PLANT
IS
SPRAYED
OVER
LOUVRES
THE
DRAFT
BEING
PULLED
THROUGH
THE
TOWER
COOLS
THE
WATER
BY
BOTH
EVAPORATION
AND
CONVECTION
THE
SENSIBLE
HEAT
EXTRACTED
FROM
THE
COOLING
WATER
IS
THE
DRIVING
FORCE
FOR
DRAFT
GENERATION
IT
SHOULD
BE
NOTED
THAT
THE
HOURGLASSSHAPED
COOLING
TOWERS
ARE
USED
ON
BOTH
FOSSILE
AND
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
IT
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
NOTED
THAT
AT
LOCATIONS
WHERE
WATER
IS
PLENTIFUL
THE
COOLING
TOWERS
ARE
ONLY
USED
PART
TIME
WHEN
THE
DISCHARGE
TEMPERATURE
WOULD
EXCEED
SOME
RELEASE
LIMIT
IT
WAS
ONCE
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
WARM
DISCHARGE
WATER
WAS
DAMAGING
TO
FISH
FISHERMEN
KNOW
THAT
IS
THOROUGHLY
INCORRECT
NONTHELESS
STRINGENT
USUALLY
STATE
REGULATIONS
REMAIN
IN
SOME
INSTANCES
SINCE
IT
TYPICALLY
TAKES
HP
WORTH
OF
PUMPING
TO
MOVE
THE
VOLUME
OF
WATER
NEEDED
TO
COOL
A
MWE
PLANT
THE
COST
OF
USING
THE
TOWERS
IS
NOT
INSIGNIFICANT
