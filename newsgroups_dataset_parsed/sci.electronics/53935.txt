am
having

obtaining
the

from
a

clock
lowest
current
drain
i
can
acheive
at
vcc
is
this
is
three
times
the
specified
maximum
made
sure
that
reset
is
asserted
for
trlh
after
powerup
and
as
is
low
during
this
time
made
sure
that
there
is
a
cycle
on
as
after
the
negation
of
rd
or
wr
during
which
stby
was
asserted
are
any
of
the
inputs
to
the
chip
coming
from
ttl
standbydrain
specs
for
cmos
chips
typically
apply
only
if
inputs
are
pulled
all
the
way
down
to
zero
or
all
the
way
up
to
vcc
ttl
isnt
good
at
doing
the
former
and
it
wont
do
the
latter
at
all
without
help
from
pullup
resistors
this
sort
of
thing
can
easily
multiply
power
consumption
by
a
considerable
factor
because
the
cmos
transistors
that
are
supposed
to
be
off
arent
all
the
way
hard
off
all
work
is
one
mans
