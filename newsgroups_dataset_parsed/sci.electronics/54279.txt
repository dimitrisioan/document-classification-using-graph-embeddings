RE
LEAD
ACID
BATTERIES
PART
THE
LEADACID
SECONDARY
CELL
RELEASES
ENERGY
ELECTRICITY
WITH
THE
FOLLOWING
CHEMICAL
REACTION
PB
LEAD
AND
LEAD
IV
OXIDE
AND
SULFURIC
ACID
PRODUCE
LEAD
SULFATE
AND
WATER
HEATS
OF
FORMATION
DELETED
THE
HEAT
OF
REACTION
AT
C
IS
THEREFORE
KCAL
PER
MOLE
PRODUCED
NOTE
THAT
LEAD
SULFATE
IS
NOT
VERY
SOLUBLE
GRAMS
PER
GRAMS
WATER
AT
C
AND
IT
WILL
THUS
PRECIPITATE
OUT
OF
SOLUTION
WHERE
THE
REACTION
IS
OCCURRING
OR
THE
CATHODE
POSITIVE
TERMINAL
OF
THE
BATTERY
I
AM
ALMOST
SURE
IT
IS
THE
POSITIVE
TERMINAL
WHERE
THE
PRECIPITATE
FORMS
BUT
I
MAY
BE
WRONG
OH
WELL
I
DONT
HAVE
A
CORRODED
BATTERY
TO
CORROBATE
AND
I
DONT
FEEL
LIKE
THINKING
THROUGH
IT
RIGHT
NOW
THE
MAJOR
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
IS
THAT
THE
REACTION
TAKES
PLACE
IN
AN
ACID
SOLUTION
IS
SOLUBLE
IN
AN
ACID
SOLUTION
AND
WILL
NOT
PRECIPITATE
OUT
ALSO
IS
IN
A
WATER
SOLUTION
AS
AND
THUS
THE
HEATS
OF
FORMATION
OF
AND
ARE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
IRRELEVANT
WHAT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
NOTICE
HERE
IS
THAT
THE
REACTION
AS
YOU
KNEW
IT
WOULD
BE
IS
EXOTHERMIC
OR
ENERGY
DISCHARGING
AS
IT
TURNS
OUT
THE
REACTION
IS
INDEED
EXOTHERMIC
HEAT
PRODUCING
MORE
ABOUT
THIS
LATER
WHAT
ACTUALLY
HAPPENS
TO
MAKE
THE
BATTERY
COMPLETELY
USELESS
IS
THIS
WERE
TALKING
LEADACID
BATTERIES
OF
COURSE
THE
BATTERY
SLOWLY
SELF
DISCHARGES
AS
THIS
DISCHARGE
TAKES
PLACE
TWO
THINGS
HAPPEN
THE
LEVEL
OF
PB
IONS
IN
THE
ACID
SOLUTION
INCREASES
IE
THE
LEAD
AND
LEAD
OXIDE
PLATES
ARE
DISSOLVED
THE
LEVEL
OF
IONS
IN
THE
ACID
SOLUTION
DECREASES
IE
THE
SOLUTION
BECOMES
LESS
ACIDIC
OR
MORE
LIKE
WATER
IF
YOU
LIKE
NOW
AS
THE
POST
TO
WHICH
I
AM
RESPONDING
CORRECTLY
STATED
WILL
PRECIPITATE
IN
A
WATER
NONACID
SOLUTION
WHEN
THE
BATTERY
DIES
IE
IS
FULLY
DISCHARGED
WE
END
UP
WITH
A
HIGH
CONCENTRATION
OF
PB
AND
IN
WATER
SO
FORMS
IN
THE
SOLUTION
AND
FALLS
TO
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
BATTERY
OF
COURSE
THIS
HAPPENS
IN
VARYING
DEGREES
THE
MORE
DISCHARGED
THE
MORE
PRECIPITATE
FORMS
THE
PRECIPITATE
FORMS
A
CONDUCTIVE
LAYER
ON
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
BATTERY
IF
THERE
IS
ENOUGH
OF
THE
LEAD
AND
LEAD
OXIDE
PLATES
LEFT
TO
TOUCH
THE
PRECIPITATE
MORE
COMMON
IN
A
NEWER
BATTERY
A
DEAD
SHORT
RESULTS
I
HAVE
SEEN
PRODUCTS
IN
AUTOMOTIVE
SHOPS
TO
CORRECT
THIS
CONDITION
BUT
THEY
ARE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
USELESS
THEY
CAN
DISSOLVE
THE
BUT
CANNOT
RESTORE
THE
LEAD
AND
LEAD
OXIDE
PLATES
PROPERLY
YOU
MAY
HAVE
SOME
SUCCESS
WITH
THESE
PRODUCTS
FOR
A
NEWER
BATTERY
STUFF
DELETED
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHY
LEADACID
BATTERIES
DO
INDEED
DISCHARGE
FASTER
WHEN
STORED
ON
CONCRETE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
WOOD
OR
EARTH
DIRT
ONE
SHOULD
RECALL
LECHATELIERS
PRINCIPLE
WHICH
CAN
BE
PARAPHRASED
AS
ANYTHING
SUBJECTED
TO
SOME
STRESS
WILL
ACT
TO
MOVE
TO
A
MORE
COMFORTABLE
POSITION
HERE
ARE
THE
THERMAL
CONDUCTIVITIES
OF
A
SOME
SELECTED
MATERIALS
STUFF
DELETED
THIS
IS
WHERE
LECHATELIERS
PRINCIPLE
COMES
INTO
PLAY
REMOVING
ENERGY
FROM
THE
EXOTHERMIC
REACTION
WILL
DRIVE
THE
REACTION
FURTHER
TO
COMPLETION
IF
THE
REACTION
NORMALLY
OCCURS
AT
ROOM
TEMPERATURE
KEEPING
THE
BATTERY
AT
THAT
TEMPERATURE
REQUIRES
THE
REMOVAL
OF
ANY
HEAT
PRODUCED
A
CONCRETE
SURFACE
IS
A
BETTER
HEAT
SINK
THAN
A
DIRT
OR
WOOD
SURFACE
STORE
A
BATTERY
IN
THE
CORNER
OF
A
POURED
CONCRETE
BASEMENT
AND
YOU
HAVE
SURFACES
REMOVING
ENERGY
WHICH
PULLS
THE
REACTION
ALONG
THIS
STUFF
IS
JUST
MADE
UP
BY
THE
AUTHOR
AND
IS
COMPLETELY
INVALID
IN
FACT
THE
DISCHARGE
REACTION
TAKES
PLACE
AT
A
HIGHER
RATE
AT
HIGHER
TEMPERATURES
A
LOGICAL
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
ABOVE
ARGUMENT
IS
THIS
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
YOUR
CAR
TO
START
LOWER
THE
BATTERY
TEMPERATURE
TO
TO
PULL
THE
REACTION
ALONG
WE
ALL
KNOW
FROM
EXPERIENCE
AT
LEAST
THOSE
OF
US
IN
CANADA
DO
IT
GETS
COLD
UP
HERE
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
IF
WE
WANT
TO
START
OUR
CAR
ON
A
REALLY
COLD
DAY
WE
WARM
THE
BATTERY
BESIDES
WHICH
THERE
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
ENERGY
RELEASED
THROUGH
SELF
DISCHARGE
TO
APPRECIABLY
RAISE
THE
TEMPERATURE
THE
AIR
WOULD
AMPLY
DISSIPATE
ANY
SUCH
HEAT
WHETHER
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
BATTERY
WAS
INSULATED
OR
NOT
THIS
IS
OF
COURSE
IRRELEVANT
SINCE
YOU
WOULD
WANT
THE
BATTERY
TO
BE
COOL
DURING
STORAGE
JUST
KEEP
THE
BATTERY
IN
A
COOL
DRY
PLACE
AND
KEEP
IT
CHARGED
