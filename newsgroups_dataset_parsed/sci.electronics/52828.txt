WRITES
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
ABOUT
RADAR
DECTECTORS
ALL
THEY
ARE
IS
A
PASSIVE
DEVICE
MUCH
LIKE
THE
RADIO
IN
YOUR
CAR
THEY
WORK
AS
AN
ANTENNA
PICKING
UP
THAT
RADAR
SIGNALS
THAT
THE
RADAR
GUN
SENDS
OUT
THEREFORE
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
WAY
OF
DETECTING
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
ANY
MORE
THAN
THERE
WOULD
BE
OF
DETECTING
WHETHER
SOME
ONE
HAD
A
RADIO
IN
THEIR
CAR
FROM
MY
RATHER
RUSTY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
RADIO
MOST
RADIO
RECEIVERS
USE
A
SUPERHET
CIRCUIT
SO
THAT
THE
INCOMING
SIGNAL
IS
MIXED
WITH
A
LOCAL
OSCILLATOR
GIVING
A
FIXED
INTERMEDIATE
FREQUENCY
IF
THAT
IS
MORE
EASILY
AMPLIFIED
THE
DETECTOR
DETECTORS
WORK
BY
PICKING
UP
IF
RERADIATED
FROM
YOUR
RADAR
DETECTOR
IN
BRITAIN
WHERE
ONE
HASUSED
TO
PAY
FOR
A
TV
LICENCE
THERE
AREWERE
TV
DETECTOR
VANS
PROWLING
THE
STREETS
LOOKING
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
HADNT
PAID
THEIR
LICENCE
FEE
THEY
HAD
A
COUPLE
OF
LONG
SOLENOID
ANTENNAE
ON
THE
ROOF
AND
I
BELIEVE
COULD
TRIANGULATE
AN
OPERATING
TV
FROM
THE
IF
I
WONDER
HOW
MUCH
OF
THE
IF
IS
RADIATED
BACK
FROM
THE
DETECTOR
ANTENNA
AND
HOW
MUCH
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
MODULE
IT
MIGHT
BE
WORTH
PUTTING
THE
DETECTOR
IN
A
PROPER
RF
