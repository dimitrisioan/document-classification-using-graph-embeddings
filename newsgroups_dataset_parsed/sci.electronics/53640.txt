getting
a
custommade
package
is
too
expensive
so
i
am
trying
to
choose
between
a
flatpak
and
a
leadless
chip
carrier
the
flatpack
would
be
hard
to
test
since
it
has
to
be
soldered
on
to
the
test
setup
and
i
would
spend
loads
of
time
soldering
as
i
kept
changing
the
test
chip
the
leadless
chip
carrier
sockets
also
have
long
lead
lines
and
may
not
work
at
high
speeds
does
anyone
out
there
have
experienceknowledge
of
this
field
i
would
greatly
appreciate
help
any
ideas
names
of
companies
manufacturing
holderssocketspackages
would
help
check
with
kyocera
america
inc
prime
park
way
suite
natick
ma
they
are
one
of
the
largest
manufacturers
of
ic
packaging
in
the
world
it
sounds
like
you
would
be
a
good
candidate
for
wafer
probing
or
at
least
ic
probing
to
test
performance
hp
cascade
microtech
and
tektronix
should
be
able
to
help
you
here
one
note
testing
at
high
frequency
accurately
can
be
an
expensive
