REGARDING
POINTING
AN
ANTENNA
AT
A
LEAKY
CATV
CABLE
WOW
WHAT
A
CONCEPT
DOES
ANYBODY
WANT
TO
SPECULATE
ON
HOW
THIS
NONCONNECTION
WOULD
FIT
INTO
THE
THEFT
OF
CABLE
SERVICES
LAWS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
UNLESS
THIS
CASE
IS
SPECIFICALLY
WRITTEN
INTO
THE
LEGISLATION
THAT
THE
CABLE
COMPANY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
A
LEG
TO
STAND
UPON
IN
COURT
WELL
THE
CATV
COMPANY
IN
THE
US
IS
ACCOUNTABLE
TO
THE
FCC
FOR
HOW
MUCH
TRANSMISSION
THEIR
CABLES
MAKE
IN
FACT
IVE
HEARD
FIRST
HAND
ABOUT
HOW
THE
CATV
COMPANY
ASKED
TO
INSPECT
THE
WIRING
IN
A
HOMEBUSINESS
TO
FIND
THE
SOURCE
OF
RF
LEAKS
IVE
HEARD
MANY
OF
THEIR
VANS
HAVE
RF
DETECTORS
AND
THEY
KEEP
ONE
EYE
ON
THEM
AS
THEY
DRIVE
DOWN
THE
STREET
IF
THE
CABLE
IS
LEAKY
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
USABLE
SIGNAL
I
WOULD
GUESS
THAT
THEYRE
PROBABLY
IN
VIOLATION
OF
FCC
TRANSMISSION
LAWS
IN
ENGLAND
THEY
DO
DID
REQUIRE
PERMITS
TO
OPERATE
A
TV
SUPPOSEDLY
THE
TV
POLICE
DROVE
AROUND
WITH
RF
DETECTORS
LOOKING
FOR
THE
IF
OR
WHATEVER
PRODUCED
BY
A
RECEIVER
THAT
WASNT
REGISTERED
IM
GUESSING
THE
PURPOSE
WAS
JUST
SOMETHING
ELSE
THEY
COULD
GET
AWAY
WITH
TAXING
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THE
TV
POLICE
WEREARE
JUST
URBAN
LEGEND
OR
AN
ACTUALITY
THE
TV
POLICE
ARE
STILL
WITH
US
IM
AFRAID
A
POUND
FINE
GOES
OUT
TO
THE
UNLICENSED
