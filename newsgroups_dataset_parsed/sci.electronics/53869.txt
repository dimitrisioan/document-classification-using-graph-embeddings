YES
I
KNOW
IT
SOUNDS
CRAZY
CALL
IT
AN
URGE
CALL
IT
WHAT
YOU
WANT
JUST
DONT
ASK
WHY
ANYWAY
ID
LIKE
TO
BUILD
A
UV
FLASHLIGHT
CHEAPLY
FLASHLIGHT
MEANS
IT
SHOULD
BE
REASONABLY
PORTABLE
BUT
COULD
HAVE
A
POWER
PACK
IF
NECESSARY
MY
MAIN
QUESTION
IS
THE
BULB
WHERE
CAN
I
GET
UV
BULBS
DO
THEY
NEED
A
LOT
OF
POWER
ETC
ETC
IM
NOT
TOO
CONCERNED
WITH
WHETHER
ITS
LONGWAVE
OR
SHORTWAVE
BUT
HEY
IF
ANYONE
HAS
A
CHEAP
SOURCE
OF
BULBS
ILL
TAKE
BOTH
CHECK
OUT
A
MEDICAL
SUPPLY
CATALOG
THE
THING
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
IS
CALLED
A
WOODS
LAMP
SO
YOU
CAN
CHECK
FOR
WOODS
SIGN
CERTAIN
SKIN
CONDITIONS
FLOURECSE
SP
UNDER
UV
LIGHT
THEY
COME
IN
DISPOSABLE
PENLIGHT
LIKE
TYPES
AND
LARGER
AC
POWERED
TYPES
IT
IS
ALSO
USED
IN
EYE
EXAMINATIONS
A
FLOURESCENT
DYE
IS
INTRODUCED
TO
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
EYE
THEN
UV
IS
SHINED
ON
IT
SHOWS
UP
SCRATCHES
AND
ABRASIONS
VERY
CLEARLY
THAT
WOULD
OTHERWISE
BE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
DETECT
FOR
THE
COMPLETEST
THE
DYE
IS
CALLED
FLOUESCIEN
AND
IN
NORMAL
LIGHT
APPEARS
ORANGISH
AND
LEAVES
A
MILD
BURNING
SENSATION
TO
THE
EYE
FOR
MINUTES
UNTIL
THE
TEARS
FLUSH
IT
ALL
OUT
HAVE
FUN
DALE
