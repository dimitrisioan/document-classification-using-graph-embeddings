hi
folks
i
borrowed
a
vhs
tape
from
a
friend
and
it
has
a
warning
in
the
begining
sayi
that
attempts
to
copy
the
tape
will
result
in
destroying
the
copy
and
the
original
i
found
this
unbelievable
as
playing
and
recording
are
two
differen
processes
however
ive
never
seen
this
tape
being
sold
anywhere
so
i
dont
want
to
take
the
chance
even
its
small
anyone
has
experience
in
this
kind
of
selfdestructing
video
tapes
thanks
in
advance

dod
to
put
it
bluntly
they
are
full
of
it
paying
a
tape
is
playing
a
tape
there
is
no
difference
whether
the
output
goes
to
a
second
vcr
or
to
a
tv
how
the
vcr
or
tv
reacts
to
this
signal
is
a
different
story
see
messages
pertaining
to
macrovision
copy
protection
in
order
for
the
tape
to
selfdestruct
it
would
have
to
have
circuitry
of
its
own
within
the
tape
case
the
circuit
would
have
to
somehow
magically
determine
what
the
output
of
the
vcr
is
connected
to
the
circuit
would
then
have
to
have
an
erasing
head
to
actually
do
anything
it
is
a
pretty
lame
scare
tactic
ive
seen
something
similar
on
a
bbs
when
the
sysop
wanted
to
he
could
have
a
message
sent
to
the
users
end
saying
that
it
is
sending
the
code
