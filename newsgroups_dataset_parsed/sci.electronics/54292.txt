platen
etc
flew
across
the
room
and
several
people
in
the
room
almost
had
heart
attacks
beware
the
explosive
properties
of
vapor
we
use
it
as
starting
fluid
for
jet
skis
the
fact
that
its
a
lubricant
works
very
well
since
jet
skis
are
cycle
it
also
helps
when
a
ski
floods
with
water
because
we
clean
the
spark
plus
with
the
stuff
ob
scielectronics
i
have
an
officestudio
in
my
garage
with
a
phone
in
it
our
wireless
phone
has
a
page
feature
where
you
can
make
the
phone
or
hand
set
ring
to
get
the
attention
of
the
other
person
is
there
a
simple
circuit
that
i
can
use
over
the
second
pair
of
wires
or
the
first
pair
to
emulate
this
effect
with
the
phone
in
the
garage
ie
push
a
button
to
make
the
phone
ring
in
the
house
or
push
a
button
to
make
it
ring
in
the
garage
