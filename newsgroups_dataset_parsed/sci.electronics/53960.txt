USED
ONCHIP
CAPACITORS
TO
REDUCE
GROUNDBOUNCE
NOISE
ON
A
SMALL
SYSTOLIC
ARRAY
CHIP
THAT
HAD
LOADS
ON
THE

LINES
DESIGN
WAS
IN
NWELL
CMOS
USING
THE
MOSIS
SCALABLE
DESIGN
RULES
HERE
ARE
SOME
THOUGHTS
ON
THE
BYPASS
CAPACITORS
THEY
DONT
HELP
MUCH
WITH
SIMULTANEOUS
OUTPUT
SWITCHINGTHERE
IS
STILL
A
LARGE
INDUCTANCE
BETWEEN
THE
BYPASS
CAPACITOR
AND
THE
LOAD
CAPACITOR
ON
BOTH
THE
SIGNAL
LINE
AND
THE
GROUND
RETURN
SO
YOU
STILL
GET
GROUND
AND
POWER
LINE
BOUNCE
THEY
DO
HELP
A
LOT
WITH
ONCHIP
LOADS
AS
I
HAD
WITH
THE
HIGH
LOAD
ON
THE
CLOCK
LINES
THE
TRANSIENTS
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
SUPPRESS
ARE
REALLY
HIGH
FREQUENCY
SO
FORGET
ABOUT
LARGE
AREAS
OF
POLYTHINOXIDEDIFF
CAPACITORS
SINCE
THE
RC
TIME
CONSTANT
IS
TOO
LARGE
WHAT
I
DID
IS
TO
MAKE
A
METAL
POLY
DIFF
SANDWICH
BUT
PUT
A
LOT
OF
HOLES
IN
THE
POLY
LAYER
ALLOWING
FREQUENT
CONTACTS
I
FORGET
EXACTLY
HOW
WIDE
THE
POLY
LINES
WERE
IF
I
WERE
DOING
THIS
DESIGN
AGAIN
ID
PROBABLY
OMIT
THE
DIFF
ALTOGETHER
AND
USE
A
SOLID
POLY
SHEET
INSTEAD
USING
JUST
AND
POLY
AND
SUBSTRATE
BUT
THAT
HAS
SUCH
A
HIGH
RESISTANCE
IT
CAN
BE
IGNORED
AT
THESE
SPEEDS
YOU
ARE
PROBABLY
BETTER
OFF
TRYING
TO
TUNE
YOUR
CIRCUIT
TO
RUN
WITH
SLIGHTLY
SLOWER
EDGES
AND
LOWER
VOLTAGE
SWINGS
ESPECIALLY
FOR
OUTPUT
SIGNALLING
THAN
SPENDING
CHIP
AREA
ON
CAPACITORS
I
HAD
SPARE
SPACE
ON
THE
DIE
SINCE
THE
CIRCUIT
WAS
TOO
BIG
FOR
A
MOSIS
TINY
CHIP
AND
THE
NEXT
SIZE
UP
WAS
TWICE
AS
BIG
AS
I
NEEDED
