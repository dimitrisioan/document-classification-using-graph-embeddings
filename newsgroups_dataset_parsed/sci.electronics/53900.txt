TO
THE

PROTECTED

KETIL
ALBERTSENTIH
WRITES
MAY
WE
INTERPRET
THIS
AS
AN
OFFER
TO
VOLUNTEER
AS
EDITOR
FOR
A
COPY
PROTECTION
FAQ
I
AM
QUITE
SURE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
ALONE
WELCOMING
SUCH
AN
INITIATIVE
I
WILL
VOLUNTEER
TO
ASK
SOME
OF
THE
QUESTIONS
IF
YOU
WILL
PROVIDE
THE
ANSWERS
OK
HERE
COULD
BE
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
OR
ANSWER
OR
SOMETHING
Q
I
WANT
TO
COPYPROTECT
A
PROGRAM
I
WROTE
HOW
SHOULD
I
DO
IT
A
YOU
WOULD
BE
WISE
NOT
TO
COPYPROTECT
THAT
PROGRAM
YOU
SEE
THOSE
PEOPLE
THAT
WANTS
TO
GET
A
CRACKED
COPY
OF
YOUR
PROGRAM
WILL
GO
TO
VARIOUS
LENGTH
TO
CRACK
YOUR
PROGRAM
AND
SOME
OF
THOSE
CRACKERS
ARE
GOOD
AND
KNOW
THE
COMMON
TRICKS
SO
THE
COPY
PROTECTION
WOULDNT
STOP
THOSE
OK
THEN
WHAT
ABOUT
LEGITIMATE
USERS
COPY
PROTECTION
CAN
BE
A
HASSLE
FOR
LEGITIMATE
USERS
AND
CAN
HINDER
THEM
IN
THEIR
WORK
EXPECIALLY
IF
THERE
IS
SOME
KEY
ITEM
THAT
CAN
GET
LOST
SO
THE
COPY
PROTECTION
WOULDNT
HELP
MUCH
OF
THE
LEGITIMATE
USERS
BUT
WOULD
MAKE
LIFE
SOMEWHAT
OF
A
MISERY
FOR
THEM
THIS
IS
MY
OPINION
AND
I
SPEAK
AS
A
LEGITIMATE
USER
YOU
ARE
OF
COURSE
FREE
TO
HAVE
YOUR
OPINION
ABOUT
THIS
SUBJECT
