HOW
TO
GET
RID
OF
FLYBACK
WHINE
I
RECENTLY
TOOK
APART
MY
COLOR
SONY
TV
TO
CLEAN
THE
VOLUME
PUSHBUTTONS
AND
WHEN
I
PUT
THE
BEAST
BACK
TOGETHER
THE
FLYBACK
WHINE
GOT
MUCH
LOUDER
IS
THIS
EASY
TO
FIX
WHICH
PART
IS
RESONATING
I
HAVE
HEARD
RUMORS
OF
A
SPRAY
THAT
WILL
FIX
THE
NOISE
IS
THIS
A
SIMPLE
THING
FOR
A
TV
REPAIRMAN
TO
FIX
