I
GOT
A
QUESTION
FROM
MY
DAD
WHICH
I
REALLY
CANT
ANSWER
AND
ID
APPRECIATE
SOME
NETWISDOM
HIS
QUESTION
IS
ABOUT
SOME
DIAMETER
BALLS
WHICH
ARE
ATTACHED
TO
ELECTRIC
POWER
LINES
IN
HIS
AREA
HES
SEEN
UP
TO
A
HALF
DOZEN
BETWEEN
TWO
POLES
NEITHER
OF
US
HAVE
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
ELECTRIC
POWER
DISTRIBUTION
MY
ONLY
GUESS
WAS
THAT
THEY
MAY
BE
A
CAPACITIVE
DEVICE
TO
EQUALIZE
THE
INDUCTANCE
OF
THE
GRID
BUT
WHY
SO
MANY
BETWEEN
TWO
POLES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
REALLY
ARE
IS
THERE
A
RELATED
FAQ
FOR
THIS
IS
THERE
A
BETTER
GROUP
TO
SUBMIT
TO
WED
BOTH
APPRECIATE
SOME
ENLIGHTENMENT
I
THINK
THOSE
ARE
TO
MAKE
THE
LINES
MORE
VISIBLE
TO
AIRPLANES
AND
HELICOPTERS
CHEAPER
THAN
BLINKING
RED
LIGHTS
COURSE
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
