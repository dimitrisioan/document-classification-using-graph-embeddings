can

im
wondering
if
its
possible
to
use
radio
waves
to
measure
the
distance
between
a
transmitters
and
receiver
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
measure
the
signal
strength
and
determine
distance
this
would
be
for
short
distances
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuracy
of
inches
or
so
this
would
be
susceptible
to
fading
multipath
etc
we
used
to
use
a
system
at
the
shop
made
by
tellurometer
in
south
africa
it
used
a
ghz
signal
between
units
across
the
distance
to
be
measured
the
ghz
was
just
the
carrier
the
real
signals
were
several
switched
ones
around
mhz
or
so
whose
relative
phases
at
the
receiver
would
read
out
the
digits
of
the
distance
down
to
cm
if
needed
the
units
came
with
psychrometers
sp
to
measure
the
relative
humidity
and
instructions
for
correction
of
the
measurements
due
to
rh
and
temp
they
were
rather
heavy
and
required
an
operator
at
each
end
current
technology
uses
polarized
reflectors
dual
polaization
txrx
and
psuedorandom
coding
of
a
radar
pulse
about
the
same
resolution
at
x
band
much
better
at
only
one
end
is
heavy
