TDIS
A
GOOD
CHOICE
FOR
A
CB
OR
WAVE
TD
I
READ
THE
INSTALLATION
INSTRUCTIONS
ON
A
WAVE
ANTENNA
TDAND
THEY
SUGGESTED
THAT
I
USE
AN
SWR
TO
TUNE
IT
AT
CHANNEL
TDAND
CHANNEL
FOR
A
MINIMUM
READING
QUESTION
IS
WHY
CHANNEL
AND
THE
BEST
ANTENNA
IS
ONE
THAT
WILL
LET
OUT
THE
MOST
WAVE
PROBABLY
NOT
THE
BEST
EXPLANATION
BUT
THE
REST
MAKES
SENSE
A
ONE
WAVE
WILL
CANCELL
ITSELF
OUT
BTW
NO
SUCH
BEASTIE
YES
THERE
IS
NOT
COMMON
FOR
CB
THE
PATTERN
IS
DIFFERENT
SORT
OF
A
CLOVERLEAF
WITH
FOUR
MAIN
LOBES
THE
BEST
IS
A
WAVE
ANTENNA
FOLLOWED
BY
THEN
ETC
USE
OF
ANYTHING
UNDER
WAVE
FOR
TRANSMITTING
IS
VERY
UNCOMMON
THE
USUAL
RUBBER
DUCK
USES
A
COIL
TO
FOOL
ITSELF
INTO
LOOKING
LIKE
A
QUARTER

I
RECCOMEND
THE
