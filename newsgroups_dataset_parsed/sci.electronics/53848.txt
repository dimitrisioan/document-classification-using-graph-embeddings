wa
tdwhat
tdis
a
good
choice
for
a
cb
or
wave
td
i
read
the
installation
instructions
on
a
wave
antenna
tdand
they
suggested
that
i
use
an
swr
to
tune
it
at
channel
tdand
channel
for
a
minimum
reading
question
is
why
channel
and
the
best
antenna
is
one
that
will
let
out
the
most
wave
probably
not
the
best
explanation
but
the
rest
makes
sense
a
one
wave
will
cancell
itself
out
btw
no
such
beastie
yes
there
is
not
common
for
cb
the
pattern
is
different
sort
of
a
cloverleaf
with
four
main
lobes
the
best
is
a
wave
antenna
followed
by
then
etc
use
of
anything
under
wave
for
transmitting
is
very
uncommon
the
usual
rubber
duck
uses
a
coil
to
fool
itself
into
looking
like
a
quarter
wave
i
reccomend
the
arrl
antenna
handbook
or
a
good
basic
book
thanks
