hello
im
considering
modernizing
some
old
wiring
in
my
home
and
i
need
a
little
advice
on
outlet
wiring
several
outlets
are
the
old
two
prong
type
without
the
ground
naturally
the
wire
feeding
these
outlets
is
without
the
ground
wire
i
noticed
at
the
fusebox
that
some
circuits
have
the
with
ground
and
that
on
these
circuits
the
ground
wire
was
tied
to
the
same
bus
as
the
neutral
white
wire
so
heres
my
question
it
seems
to
me
that
id
have
the
same
electrical
circuit
if
i
hooked
the
neutralddddddddddda
jumper
from
the
neutral
over
to
the
ground
screw
on
new
three
prong
grounding
outlets
whats
wrong
with
my
reasoning
here
first
it
will
not
pass
a
national
electrical
code
inspection
secondly
the
neutral
wire
is
current
carrying
and
the
ground
wire
shouldnt
be
or
only
during
a
fault
condition
the
reason
the
neutral
and
ground
are
tied
together
in
the
panel
is
the
tranformer
on
the
power
pole
has
a
grounded
centertap
secondary
with
the
grounded
centertap
the
neutral
this
gives
to
neutralground
from
each
side
of
the
transformer
and
across
the
transformer
so
in
effect
the
neutral
and
ground
should
be
at
the
same
potential
