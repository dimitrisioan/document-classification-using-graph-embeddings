RE
FUJITSU
HDD
THE
FUJITSU
USES
WHAT
IS
KNOWN
AS
AN
SMD
INTERFACE
STORAGE
MODULE
DEVICE
A
LOT
OF
OLDER
MINIS
USED
IT
SUN
STILL
DOES
ON
THEIR
SERVER
MODELS
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
OF
SMD
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THE
FUJI
DRIVE
YOU
HAVE
IS
RATED
AT
ABOUT
MBSEC
THATS
MEGABITS
THERE
USED
TO
BE
SEVERAL
COMPANIES
THAT
MADE
COUPLERS
FOR
THE
PC
INTERPHASE
IN
TEXAS
BEING
ONE
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THE
MARKET
PRETTY
MUCH
HAS
DRIED
UP
CONTROLLERS
FOR
THIS
TYPE
OF
DRIVE
ARE
READILY
AVAILABLE
FOR
VME
BUSES
THOUGH
RUMOR
HAS
IT
THAT
THERE
IS
A
SMD
TO
SCSI
ADAPTER
AVAILABLE
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
IT
WAS
DESIGNED
FOR
SLOWER
SMD
DEVICES
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
PC
OR
MAC
THAT
DRIVE
IS
PRETTY
MUCH
