NO
RESTRICTION
WAS
PLACED
ON
RECEIVING
RADAR
OR
CURIOUSLY
CORDLESS
PHONES
ENFORCEMENT
OF
THE
VIRGINIA
LAW
IS
IN
VIOLATION
OF
THE
FCA
OF
ISINT
THERE
SOME
KIND
OF
RULE
REGULATION
LAW
WHATEVER
IN
SOME
JURISTICTIONS
THAT
PROHIBIT
THE
USE
OF
POLICE
BAND
RECIEVERS
IN
VEHICLES
AND
THAT
RADAR
TRANSMISSIONS
ARE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
POLICE
BAND
SO
THEY
GET
COVERED
BY
THE
SAME
REGULATION
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
POLICE
BAND
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
ANYWAY
RADAR
DETECTORS
WORK
IN
SHARED
BANDS
IF
YOU
APPLIED
YOUR
TEST
ALL
OF
THOSE
RADAR
OPERATED
DOOR
OPENERS
IN
MALLS
WOULD
BE
ILLEGAL
ONE
OF
THE
GREAT
PROBLEMS
HERE
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
ILLEDUCATED
READ
ILLITERATE
PEOPLE
MAKING
TOO
MANY
LAWS
ABOUT
SUBJECTS
ON
WHICH
THEY
ARE
INCOMPETENT
THERE
MAY
WELL
BE
LAWS
REFEREING
TO
POLICE
BANDS
THEY
ARE
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
LOCAL
IN
SCOPE
STATE
OR
COUNTY
CREATED
BY
WELLMEANING
BUT
INCOMPETENT
IDIOTS
UNFORTUNALTELY
LAWS
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
BE
SENSIBLE
OR
EVEN
ENFORCEABLE
LAWMAKERS
EXIST
TO
PASS
LAWS
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
DO
SO
UNTIL
THE
DAY
WHERE
YOU
ARE
FACED
WITH
DEATH
FOR
NOT
DOING
X
AND
AMPUTATION
OF
ALL
YOUR
LIMBS
FOR
DOING
X
THE
CHOICE
WILL
BE
YOURS
NOTE
NO
