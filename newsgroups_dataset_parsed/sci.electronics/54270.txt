IM
WONDERING
IF
I
CAN
TOTE
MY
AMERICAN
TOUCH
TONE
PHONE
AROUND
WITH
ME
TO
SWEDEN
AND
GERMANY
ITS
DC
POWERED
AND
I
CAN
BUY
A
SPECIAL
ADAPTER
FOR
THAT
IN
EUROPE
THE
QUESTION
IS
IF
THE
GENERAL
ELECTRONICS
WORK
THE
SAME
I
CAN
BUY
A
DIFFERENT
WALL
PLUG
AND
REFIT
IT
IM
SURE
ID
HAVE
TO
BUT
WOULD
THAT
DO
THE
TRICK
TWO
THINGS
TO
WATCH
FOR
IN
GERMANY
AND
I
THINK
THE
SAME
HOLDS
FOR
SWEDEN
ONLY
SOME
OF
THE
CONNECTIONS
CAN
HANDLE
TONE
DIALING
SO
MAKE
SURE
THE
PHONE
CAN
BE
SET
TO
PULSE
DIALING
IN
SWEDEN
THE
IS
THE
FIRST
DIGIT
AND
ALL
OTHER
DIGITS
ARE
PUSHED
DOWN
BY
ONE
POSITION
THIS
MAKES
DIALING
AND
IN
THE
PROCESS
CONVERTING
NUMBERS
AN
INTERESTING
TASK
OTHERWISE
IT
IS
TECHNICALLY
NO
PROBLEM
TO
CONNECT
A
FOREIGN
PHONE
TO
EITHER
THE
GERMAN
OR
SWEDISH
PHONE
SYSTEM
OTOH
NEITHER
YOU
NOR
I
WOULD
EVER
TRY
THAT
AS
IT
IS
OF
COURSE
ILLEGAL
I
AM
NOT
QUITE
SO
SURE
ABOUT
THE
ILLEGALITY
OF
USING
A
REGULAR
AMERICAN
PHONE
ON
YOUR
HOME
SYSTEM
I
VAGUELY
REMEMBER
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
DEUTSCHE
BUNDESPOST
SPLIT
INTO
POSTDIENST
POSTBANK
AND
TELEKOM
THERE
WAS
SOME
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
A
NEW
REGULATION
I
KNOW
THAT
CORDLESS
OR
CELLULAR
PHONES
STILL
HAVE
TO
BE
APPROVED
BY
THE
TELEKOM
BUT
DOES
THAT
HOLD
TRUE
FOR
REGULAR
PHONES
IN
MY
AREACODE
IN
GERMANY
FRECHEN
NEAR
KOELN
YOU
CAN
USE
TOUCHTONE
DIALING
I
ASSUME
HOWEVER
THAT
MOST
AREAS
ARE
STILL
EXCLUSIVELY
SET
TO
PULSE
DIALING
LAST
TIME
I
CHECKED
JAN
THE
COLOGNE
AREACODE
WAS
STILL
SOLELY
PULSE
DIALING
BTW
TOUCH
TONE
DOES
BECOME
MORE
COMMON
IN
GERMANY
BRINGIN
WITH
IT
THE
FLOURISHING
OF
SERVICES
IN
GERMANY
I
JUST
HOPE
WELL
ALL
HAVE
ISDN
SOME
TIME

AFFORDABLE
