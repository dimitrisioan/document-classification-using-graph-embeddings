HAMS
CAN
LEGALLY
RUN
UP
TO
WATTS
IT
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
HOWEVER
THAT
A
HAM
WOULD
BE
RUNNING
THAT
KIND
OF
POWER
FROM
A
CAR
NOT
POSSIBLE
EITHER
YOUD
NEED
ABOUT
A
AMP
ALTERNATOR
FOR
JUST
THE
AMPLIFIER
IT
IS
TOO
POSSIBLE
AS
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
SAID
IT
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
BUT
DEFINATELY
POSSIBLE
CAN
YOU
SAY
BATTERIES
IVE
EVEN
SEEN
PICTURES
OF
AN
INSTALLATION
WHERE
THE
HAM
PULLED
A
