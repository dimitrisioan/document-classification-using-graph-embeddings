hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
not
possible
either
youd
need
about
a
amp
alternator
for
just
the
amplifier
it
is
too
possible
as
the
original
poster
said
it
is
very
unlikely
but
definately
possible
can
you
say
batteries
ive
even
seen
pictures
of
an
installation
where
the
ham
pulled
a
little
trailer
behind
his
car
with
a
generator
and
ran
the
full
legal
limit
while
mobile
i
dont
know
what
his
gas
mileage
was
like
though
or
where
he
found
resonators
able
to
stand
the
gaff
