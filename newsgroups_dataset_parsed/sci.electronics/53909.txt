I
BUILT
A
LITTLE
PROJECT
USING
THE
RADIO
SHACK
RELAYS
TO
SWITCH
AUDIO
I
GOT
PRETTY
BAD
CLICKS
WHEN
THE
THING
SWITCHED
IS
THERE
A
GOOD
RELAYRELAY
CIRCUIT
THAT
I
CAN
USE
FOR
SWITCHING
AUDIO
SO
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
NOISE
OF
ANY
KIND
ON
THE
AUDIO
LINES
WITH
RELAYS
ALONE
YOU
WILL
ALWAYS
GET
A
TRANSIENT
WHEN
YOU
ABRUPTLY
TURN
ON
OR
OFF
ANY
CHANNEL
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
HEAR
THE
TRANSIENT
USE
SOME
OTHER
DEVICE
A
PHOTORESISTOROUTPUT
OPTOISOLATOR
IS
THE
USUAL
SORT
OF
THING
TO
GENTLY
MUTE
THE
SIGNAL
THEN
SWITCH
THEN
REMOVE
THE
POWER
FROM
THE
LAMP
IN
THE
OPTOISOLATOR
IT
USED
TO
BE
STANDARD
PRACTICE
TO
EMPLOY
PHOTORESISTORS
IN
SWITCHING
AUDIO
BECAUSE
THE
PHOTORESISTOR
TIME
DELAY
A
FEW
THOUSANDTHS
OF
A
SECOND
KEPT
ANY
NOISE
IN
THE
DIGITAL
SIDE
WHICH
DRIVES
THE
LAMP
FROM
CONTAMINATING
THE
AUDIO
AND
THE
DEVICES
ARE
CHEAPER
THAN
RELAYS
