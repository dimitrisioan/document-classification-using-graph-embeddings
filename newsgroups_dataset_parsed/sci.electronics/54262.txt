FOR
ANY
IC
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
A
TEXTREFERENCE
THAT
WILL
INCLUDE
PINOUTS
DESCRIPTION
AND
FUNCTIONALITY
FOR
JUST
ABOUT
ANY
IC
MADE
DOES
SUCH
A
TEXT
EXIST
ARE
THERE
DOCS
ON
THE
INTERNET
THAT
REFERENCE
ICS
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GREAT
IDEA
IF
EACH
MAJOR
IC
MANUFACTURER
MADE
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
PUBLIC
AN
ANONYMOUS
FTP
SITE
WITH
ALL
ITS
DATA
BOOKS
IN
THE
FORM
OF
TEXT
FILES
ALA
RFC
STYLE
THIS
WOULD
SAVE
TIME
AND
MONEY
FOR
THE
IC
MANUFACTURER
SINCE
A
TEXT
FILE
COSTS
NOTHING
TO
SEND
AROUND
THE
WORLD
VIA
INTERNET
AND
SINCE
MOST
USERS
OF
ICS
ARE
FOUND
IN
THE
INTERNET
ANYWAY
ARE
THERE
ANY
BOOKS
AVAILABLE
FOR
PURCHASE
THAT
REFERENCE
AS
MANY
AS
POSSIBLE
OR
AM
I
GOING
TO
BE
STUCK
OBTAINING
A
ZILLION
DATABOOKS
FROM
THE
MANUFACTURERS
THOSE
LITTLE
PHONEBOOKTYPE
BOOKS
THAT
ARE
OBSOLETED
EVERY
COUPLE
YEARS
