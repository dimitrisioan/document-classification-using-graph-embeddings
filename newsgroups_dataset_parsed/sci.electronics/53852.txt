RE
BUILDING
A

FLASHLIGHT

WRITES
MY
MAIN
QUESTION
IS
THE
BULB
WHERE
CAN
I
GET
UV
BULBS
DO
THEY
NEED
A
LOT
OF
POWER
ETC
ETC
HE
ONES
I
HAVE
SEEN
ARE
ALL
FLUORESCENT
TUBES
MAYBE
YOU
COULD
FIND
A
SMALL
TUBE
TO
GO
IN
ONE
OF
THOSE
HANDHELD
FLUORO
LANTERNS
ONE
OTHER
THING
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
MENTIONED
SOMETHING
ABOUT
NEARUV
LIGHT
BEING
CHEAPER
TO
GET
AT
THAN
ACTUAL
UV
LIGHT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
HE
WAS
REFERRING
TO
BLUE
LIGHTS
ULTRAVIOLET
BY
DEFINITION
GOES
FROM
THE
BLUE
END
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
THAT
PEOPLE
SEE
TO
THE
RADIO
SPECTRUM
XRAYS
COSMIC
RAYS
ETC
POSSIBLY
YOU
COULD
GET
LIGHT
AT
THE
FRINGE
OF
VISIBILITY
WHICH
PEOPLE
WITH
FALSE
EYELENSES
CAN
SEE
EASILY
SINCE
ITS
YOUR
LENSES
THAT
SOAK
UP
MOST
OF
THE
UV
HOWEVER
SINCE
MOST
PEOPLE
USE
UV
TO
GET
OTHER
THINGS
TO
GLOW
AND
THE
NEARBLUE
IS
LESS
ENERGETIC
IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
NOT
WORK
AS
WELL
IF
IT
WORKED
AT
ALL
LECTURE
ON
BASIC
ATOMIC
PHYSICS
FITS
IN
HERE
ABOUT
ELECTRON
TRANSITIONS
QUANTUM
