LEWIS
FOSKETT
WRITES
IM
DOING
SOUND
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
BANDS
AROUND
HERE
AND
WE
NEED
DIRECT
INPUT
BOXES
FOR
THE
KEYBOARDS
THESE
ARE
THE
LITTLE
BOXES
THAT
TAKE
A
LINE
LEVEL
OUT
OF
THE
KEYBOARD
AND
TRANSFORM
IT
INTO
LOWZ
FOR
THE
RUN
TO
THE
MIXER
SADLY
THEY
COST
LIKE
OR
MORE
EACH
AND
IM
GOING
TO
NEED
LIKE
OR
OF
THEM
I
LOOKED
INSIDE
ONE
BELONGING
TO
ANOTHER
BAND
AND
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
JUST
A
TRANSFORMER
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
PLANS
FOR
BUILDING
THEM
PERHAPS
IN
ANDERTONS
ELECTRONIC
PROJECTS
FOR
MUSICIANS
BOOK
WHICH
I
AM
HAVING
A
HELL
OF
A
TIME
TRACKING
DOWN
AN
EASY
WAY
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TO
USE
TWO
OPAMPS
TO
FORM
THE
BALANCED
LOWZ
OUTPUT
BUT
THIS
SOLUTION
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
ANY
GALVANIC
ISOLATION
BETWEEN
KEYBOARD
OR
WHATEVER
PLUGGED
AND
MIXER
IF
NO
TIGHT
REQUIREMETS
ARE
DEMANDED
AND
SOME
HUM
SNAP
CRACKLE
AND
POP
SOUNDS
FORMED
BY
GROUND
LOOPS
CAN
BE
TOLERATED
THE
OPAMP
SOLUTION
IS
JUST
WHAT
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
IT
IS
CHEAPSOMEWHAT
NOT
SURE
