i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
great
explaination
however
you
left
off
one
detail
why
do
you
always
see
them
at
nuclear
plants
but
not
always
at
fossil
fuel
plants
at
nuclear
plants
it
is
prefered
to
run
the
water
closed
cycle
whereas
fossil
fuel
plants
can
in
some
cases
get
away
with
dumping
the
hot
water
as
i
recall
the
water
isnt
as
hot
thermodynamically
in
many
fossil
fuel
plants
and
of
course
there
is
less
danger
of
radioactive
contamination
actually
fossil
fuel
plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
oil
and
gas
fired
steam
plants
also
have
condensers
but
they
usually
are
sized
to
get
the
steam
back
into
hot
water
not
most
of
the
way
down
to
ambient
some
plants
do
cool
the
condensers
with
water
rather
than
air
as
one
canadian
official
asked
about
thermal
pollution
deicing
a
river
said
up
here
we
view
heat
as
a
resource
everybody
runs
closedcycle
boilers
the
water
used
is
purified
of
solids
which
otherwise
crud
up
the
boiler
plumbing
when
the
water
boils
purifying
water
for
boiler
use
is
a
bigger
job
than
cooling
it
so
the
boiler
water
is
recycled
