how
hard
would
it
be
to
somehow
interface
them
to
some
of
the
popular
motorola
microcontrollers
i
am
a
novice
at
microcontrollers
but
i
am
starting
to
get
into
them
for
some
of
my
projects
i
have
several
simms
laying
around
from
upgraded
macs
and
if
i
could
use
them
as
free
memory
in
one
or
two
of
my
projects
that
would
be
great
one
project
that
comes
to
mind
is
a
caller
id
device
that
would
require
quite
a
bit
of
ram
to
store
several
hundered
cid
records
etc
assuming
in
expanded
muxed
mode
you
could
do
it
much
easier
if
you
get
a
dram
controller
ic
the
mmi
could
be
used
to
implement
this
or
you
could
use
a
counter
and
a
huge
multiplexer
to
provide
rowcolumnrefresh
address
multiplexing
the
thing
with
drams
is
that
they
require
wierd
timing
address
multiplexing
and
refresh
actually
if
you
wanted
to
use
a
ic
you
could
look
at
which
has
a
neat
controller
built
in
there
is
also
the
i
think
one
of
those
has
the
dram
controller
built
in
this
one
is
for
the
dram
however
the
has
only
one
more
address
line
adding
only
another
component
or
so
the
simms
are
basically
or
dram
chips
or
their
equivalent
in
fewer
packages
it
can
be
done
just
takes
a
bit
of
logic
design
im
actually
about
to
do
it
using
a
chip
ive
got
simms
thats
megabytes
on
my
apple
e
used
to
be
in
my
