SENIOR

RECENTLY
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
TO
RECEIVE
CABLE
TV
THROUGH
THE
TELESCOPIC
AERIAL
ON
THE
TOP
OF
MY
TV
THE
NEARER
THIS
AERIAL
IS
MOVED
TO
THE
CABLE
WHICH
I
AM
NOT
CONNECTED
TO
WHICH
RUNS
UNDER
THE
EAVES
OF
THE
HOUSE
THE
BETTER
THE
SIGNAL
NOW
I
WAS
WONDERING
HOW
CAN
I
IMPROVE
THE
SIGNAL
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
IMPROVE
THE
SIGNAL
SIGNIFICANTLY
SOME
CHANNELS
CABLE
EGRESS
OR
EMANATIONS
IF
YOU
WILL
ARE
BEING
RADIATED
AT
FREE
SPACE
IMPEDANCE
FROM
CABLES
THAT
MAY
BE
HARMONICALLY
REALATED
TO
CERTAIN
CHANNELS
AND
THERFORE
THE
STANDING
WAVES
AT
WAVE
WILL
TRANSFER
EFFICIENTLY
ALSO
YOUR
ANTENNA
A
LOOSE
MONOPOLE
IS
ALSO
HARMONICALLY
TUNED
AND
WILL
BE
MORE
EFFICIENT
AT
WAVELENGTH
MULTIPLES
YOUR
BEST
BET
FOR
THIS
RESEARCH
IS
TO
USE
A
TUNED
YAGI
ANTENNA
TO
GET
THE
GAIN
YOU
NEED
STD
TV
ROOF
ANTENNA
TYPE
THE
DIPOLES
SHOULD
BE
PARALLEL
TO
THE
RADIATING
CABLE
A
PREAMP
DOESNT
HELP
SIGNIFICANTLY
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
IN
MOST
CASES

WOW
WHAT
A
CONCEPT
DOES
ANYBODY
WANT
TO
SPECULATE
ON
HOW
THIS
NONCONNECTION
WOULD
FIT
INTO
THE
THEFT
OF
CABLE
SERVICES
LAWS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
UNLESS
THIS
CASE
IS
SPECIFICALLY
WRITTEN
INTO
THE
LEGISLATION
THAT
THE
CABLE
COMPANY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
A
LEG
TO
STAND
UPON
IN
COURT
DOES
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
HAVE
ANY
SPECIFIC
LEGAL
KNOWLEDGE
ON
THIS
