IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
USE
ONE
WHERE
IT
COUNTS
EGAVIATION
SPACE
SCUTTLE
ETC
THEN
I
SUGGEST
YOU
GO
AND
BUY
A
FLUKE
NEVER
SEEN
A
BECKMAN
HOWEVER
FOR
EVERY
OTHER
USE
YOU
CAN
BUY
A
CHEAPIE
MY
BECKMAN
DIED
A
FEW
DAYS
AGO
THANKS
DO
ABOUT
A
OR
FOOT
DROP
ONTO
A
LAB
TABLE
PROBABLY
NOT
INDICATIVE
OF
ANYTHING
BUT
IVE
ALREADY
FILLED
OUT
THE
REQUISITION
FOR
A
FLUKE
OH
YEAH
AND
SOMETIMES
OUR
MEASUREMENTS
HERE
DO
COUNT
NOT
OFTEN
BUT
OFTEN
ENOUGH
THAT
I
WANT
AT
LEAST
ONE
GOOD
METER
JOEL
KOLSTAD
WE
USED
TO
BUY
BECKMAN
AND
RUGGEDIZED
VERSIONS
FOR
USE
BY
ELECTRICIANS
IN
THE
STEEL
MILL
WHERE
I
WORK
AFTER
A
WHILE
WE
GOT
ROUND
TO
FILLING
ALL
THE
CURRENTINPUT
JACKS
WITH
SILICONE
ELECTRICIANS
HAVE
A
REGRETTABLE
HABIT
OF
NOT
CHECKING
WHERE
THE
LAST
GUY
LEFT
THE
LEADS
BEFORE
USING
A
DIGIT
AUTORANGING
METER
TO
CHECK
IF
A
FUSE
IS
GOOD
OR
NOT
ITS
VERY
HARD
ON
METERS
AND
ELECTRICIANS
WHEN
YOU
PUT
THE
MILLIAMP
SHUNT
ACROSS
A
VOLT
BUS
BUT
THATS
NOT
WHY
WE
STOPPED
BUYING
BECKMANS
AFTER
A
WHILE
A
LOT
OF
THEM
GOT
FUNNY
IN
THE
LCD
DISPLAY
A
BLACK
STAIN
WOULD
SPREAD
FROM
ONE
EDGE
OR
ELSE
THEYD
COME
ADRIFT
FROM
THOSE
ZEBRA
CONNECTORS
AND
FAIL
TO
OPERATE
NOW
WE
BUY
FLUKES
THE
LOWEND
SERIES
MOSTLY
AND
WE
STILL
FILL
THE
AMP
JACK
WITH
SILICONE
WHAT
THE
WORLD
NEEDS
IS
A
METER
THAT
WONT
LET
YOU
CHANGE
RANGES
OR
TURN
IT
ONOFF
WITH
A
LEAD
STUCK
IN
THE
AMPS
JACK
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF
CLEVER
PLASTIC
DETAILING
WOULD
TAKE
CARE
OF
THIS
AND
MAKE
THE
WORLD
SAFER
FOR
ELECTRICANS
ANYWAY
NOT
THAT
IVE
EVER
PUT
A
METER
ON
THE
WRONG
RANGE
INTO
A
LIVE
CIRCUIT
NO
NOT
MENOT
MORE
THAN
A
DOZEN
TIMES
ANYWAY
