WHY
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
ARE
GREEN
NOT
THAT
THE
QUESTION
IS
ANYTHING
IMPORTANT
BUT
I
AM
STILL
CURIOUS
WHY
IS
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
PRINTED
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
ARE
GREEN
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
FEW
BLUE
ONES
BUT
NO
RED
YELLOW
COMPANY
LOGO
ETC
IS
THERE
A
TECHNICAL
REASON
OR
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
THE
MARKETING
GENIUSES
HAVE
NOT
TOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
YET
JUHA
