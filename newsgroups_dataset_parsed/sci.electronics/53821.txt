I
BUILT
A
LITTLE
PROJECT
USING
THE
RADIO
SHACK
RELAYS
TO
SWITCH
AUDIO
I
GOT
PRETTY
BAD
CLICKS
WHEN
THE
THING
SWITCHED
I
WAS
DOING
MOST
OF
THE
COMMON
THINGS
ONE
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
WHEN
USING
RELAYS
AND
NOTHING
SEEMED
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
CLICKS
MY
QUESTION
IS
IS
THERE
A
GOOD
RELAYRELAY
CIRCUIT
THAT
I
CAN
USE
FOR
SWITCHING
AUDIO
SO
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
NOISE
OF
ANY
KIND
ON
THE
AUDIO
LINES
I
WILL
APPRECIATE
ANY
ADVICE
OR
REFERENCES
TO
ADVICE
ALSO
EXACT
PART
NUMBERSCOMPANY
NAMES
ETC
FOR
THE
RELAYS
WILL
HELP
ARE
YOU
SWITCHING
HIGH
LEVEL
SIGNALS
OR
LOW
LEVEL
SIGNALS
LIKE
PREAMP
OUT
LEVEL
SIGNALS
ALSO
ARE
THE
CLICKS
YOU
MENTIONING
THE
BIG
CLACK
THAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
IT
SWITCHES
OR
ARE
YOU
REFERING
TO
CONTACT
BOUNCE
HOW
ARE
YOU
DRIVING
THE
RELAYS
TTL
GATE
OUTPUT
SWITCHING
TRANSISTOR
HOW
ARE
THE
RELAYS
CONNECTED
TO
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DRIVING
NEED
MORE
SPECIFICS
TO
ANSWER
YOUR
QUESTION
AS
A
GENERAL
RULE
NO
RELAY
WILL
CLEANLY
SWITCH
AUDIO
IF
YOU
TRY
TO
TRANFER
THE
CIRCUIT
WITH
THE
CONTACTS
THE
NOISE
YOU
HEAR
IS
DUE
TO
THE
MOMENTARY
OPENING
AND
CLOSING
OF
THE
PATH
THE
NOISELESS
WAY
OF
TRANSFERING
AUDIO
IS
TO
GROUND
THE
CIRCUIT
IN
HIGH
IMPEDANCE
AUDIO
CIRCUITS
A
RESISTIVE
T
IS
CONSTRUCTED
CLOSE
TO
CHARACTERISTIC
IMPEDANCE
OF
THE
CIRCUIT
GROUNDING
THE
IMPUTS
CONNECTED
TO
THE
T
TRANSFERS
THE
AUDIO
IN
LOW
IMPEDANCE
CIRCUITS
TRANSFORMERS
ARE
USUALLY
USED
AND
THE
INPUTS
ARE
SHORTED
OUT
OR
GROUNDED
SECONDARIES
ARE
PARALLELED
AT
THE
CHARACTERISTIC
IMPEDANCE
SOMETIMES
IF
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
ACTUALLY
SWITCH
AUDIO
A
SECOND
CONTACT
IS
USED
TO
MOMENTARILY
SHORT
THE
CIRCUIT
OUTPUT
FOR
THE
DURATION
OF
THE
SWITCHING
TIME
TELEPHONE
RELAYS
ARE
HANDY
BECAUSE
CONTACTS
CAN
BE
ADJUSTED
TO
MAKE
BEFORE
BREAK
AND
VICA
VERSA
BUT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANY
OF
THESE
FOR
YEARS
NOWADYS
SWITCHING
IS
DONE
ELECTRONICALLY
WITH
OP
AMPS
ETC
A
NOVEL
CIRCUIT
I
USED
TO
BUILD
WAS
A
PRIMITIVE
OPTICAL
ISOLATOR
IT
CONSISTS
OF
A
RESISTIVE
PHOTOCELL
AND
A
LAMP
ALL
PACKAGED
IN
A
TUBE
WHEN
THE
LAMP
IS
OFF
THE
CELL
IS
HIGH
RESISTANCE
TURN
THE
LAMP
ON
AND
THE
RESISTANCE
LOWERS
PASSING
THE
AUDIO
ONCE
AGAIN
THIS
DEVICE
IN
A
T
SWITCHES
THE
AUDIO
VARYING
THE
LAMP
RESISTANCE
GIVE
A
REMOTE
VOLUME
CONTROL
USE
VARIABLE
RESISTERS
AND
YOU
HAVE
A
MIXER
LOTS
OF
LUCK
