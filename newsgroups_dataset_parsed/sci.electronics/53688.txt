YOU
ARE
EXPERIENCING
WHAT
IS
CALLED
MACROVISION
IT
IS
THE
PROTECTION
THAT
THEY
USE
ON
THE
VIDEO
TAPES
THERE
ARE
TWO
WAYS
AROUND
THIS
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
FIRST
OF
ALL
YOU
CAN
TRY
USING
A
DIFFERENT
VCR
TO
COPY
ONTO
IT
IS
THE
INPUT
OF
THE
VCR
THAT
REACTS
TO
THE
PROTECTION
SO
SOMETIMES
JUST
SWITCHING
THE
TWO
VCRS
AROUND
WILL
TAKE
CARE
OF
IT
SOME
MODELS
JUST
DONT
REACT
TO
IT
DOES
THIS
ALSO
AFFECT
THE
VIEWING
OF
TAPES
I
HAVE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
RENTED
TAPES
THEY
WERE
VIRTUALLY
UNVIEWABLE
I
FIDDLED
WITH
THE
TUNING
TRACKING
AND
VERTICAL
HOLD
BUT
IT
WAS
NO
GOOD
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOUR
TV
IS
ONE
OF
THE
ONES
THAT
ALSO
REACTS
TO
THE
VIDEO
PROTECTION
POOR
YOU
THE
MACROSCRUBBER
FROM
RADIO
ELECTRONICS
REMOVES
THE
PROTECTION
SO
YOU
SOULDNT
HAVE
ANY
MORE
PROBLEMS
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
USE
THE
METHOD
OF
COPYING
IT
FROM
ONE
VCR
TO
ANOTHER
WHERE
THE
SECOND
VCR
DOESNT
REACT
TO
THE
PROTECTION
YOU
WILL
END
UP
WITH
A
DUPLICATE
TAPE
INCLUDING
THE
PROTECTION
ONE
THOUGHT
COMES
TO
MIND
ABOUT
YOUR
PROBLEM
WHEN
PLAYING
THE
TAPE
FOR
VIEWING
ARE
YOU
FEEDING
THE
SIGNAL
FROM
THE
SOURCE
VCR
THROUGH
AN
EXTRA
DEVICE
BEFORE
GOING
TO
THE
TV
IF
YOU
FEED
IT
THROUGH
A
SECOND
VCR
FIRST
THAT
IS
YOUR
PROBLEM
AS
TO
OTHER
DEVICES
SUCH
AS
CONVERTERS
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THEY
WOULD
REACT
OR
NOT
JUST
TO
BE
SAFE
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
NOTHING
BETWEEN
THE
VCR
AND
TV
