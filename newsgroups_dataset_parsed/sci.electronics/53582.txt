re
adcom
cheap
products
i
want
to
upgrade
my
system
and
was
thinking
of
buying
adcom
seperates
i
have
heard
from
alot
of
people
though
that
adcom
sounds
great
but
that
the
components
are
made
cheaply
and
therefore
wont
last
very
long
the
time
estimates
ive
heard
are
like
only
or
years
is
this
true
i
own
the
adcom
power
amp
as
far
as
im
concerned
theres
no
amp
which
can
touch
it
at
the
price
range
the
build
quality
is
very
impressive
and
is
far
superior
to
other
amps
in
the
price
range
the
whole
amplifier
is
extremely
solid
with
massive
heat
sinks
and
very
solid
casing
if
you
open
the
amp
up
there
are
only
very
good
quality
components
in
and
the
amp
seems
to
be
designed
extremely
well
perfect
symmetry
for
both
channels
and
two
transformers
one
for
each
channel
the
binding
posts
on
the
back
of
the
amplifier
are
virtually
the
same
as
those
on
the
classe
model
ie
very
good
i
was
also
sceptical
about
the
amps
being
built
in
the
fareast
or
whereever
but
if
you
look
in
the
amp
and
see
what
components
they
use
and
how
it
was
designed
you
can
easily
see
why
the
amplifiers
sound
so
brilliant
i
cannot
see
why
people
say
the
amplifier
wont
last
not
with
those
quality
components
inside
sure
the
amp
runs
very
fairly
hot
but
thats
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incredibly
good
my
last
point
i
recently
auditioned
the
adcom
preamp
something
like
the
or
something
it
was
two
years
old
and
it
still
sounded
like
new
if
you
build
an
amplifier
decently
like
the
adcoms
they
will
sound
brilliant
and
last
a
long
time
period
just
my
thoughts
but
then
i
do
own
one
of
adcoms
amps
alan
webber
the
path
you
tread
is
narrow
and
the
drop
is
sheer
and
very
high
the
ravens
all
are
watching
from
a
vantage
point
near
by
apprehension
creeping
like
a
chootrain
up
your
spine
will
the
tightrope
reach
the
end
will
the
final
couplet
rhyme
