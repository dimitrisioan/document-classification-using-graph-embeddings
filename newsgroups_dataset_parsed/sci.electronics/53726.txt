im
looking
for
an
ic
that
will
convert
voltage
levels
to
ttl
voltage
levels
something
relatively
inexpensive
would
be
nice
too
anyone
have
a
suggestion
thanks
well
it
looks
as
if
digikey
sells
a
chip
with
the
number
that
does
what
you
want
they
are
selling
it
for
about
digikey
also
sells
quad
line
receivers
parts
and
a
quad
line
driver
part
is
also
sold
i
guess
if
you
dont
wont
to
supply
the
chips
with
the
pumpup
circuitry
might
be
worth
the
extra
cost
but
and
are
available
at
your
friendly
neighborhood
rs
parts
for
and
for
