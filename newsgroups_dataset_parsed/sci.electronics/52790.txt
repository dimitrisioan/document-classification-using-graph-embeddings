can
someone
out
there
explain
exactly
what
the
trigger
feature
found
on
oscilloscopes
does
lots
og
good
explanation

lots
more

is
it
just
me
or
does
anybody
else
out
there
not
like
digital
scopes
my
school
has
some
beauutful
hp
that
are
digital
with
all
the
bells
and
whistles
including
softkeys
which
i
think
are
a
loveley
touch
that
is
software
keys
you
dont
forget
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
computer
those
scopes
even
with
all
their
neatness
still
make
the
ickyest
looking
waves
lotsa
features
but
ugly
output
and
those
are
the
best
digitals
i
have
ever
seen
ive
seen
a
lot
of
cheaper
digitals
and
they
look
terrible
i
think
the
hangup
with
digital
scopes
is
that
you
have
to
know
so
much
more
about
them
and
how
they
work
on
a
scopebyscope
basis
and
some
of
the
functions
are
typically
presented
in
my
opinion
in
a
counterintuitive
fashion
hp
has
made
some
strides
in
their
series
imo
automatic
setups
are
fine
for
simple
repetitive
waveforms
but
can
give
you
some
crazy
results
on
more
complex
events
where
you
need
to
understand
how
the
scope
is
actually
measuringprocessing
the
event
for
example
is
the
scope
in
equivalent
time
or
in
real
time
sampling
mode
equivalent
time
being
a
mode
where
samples
are
builtup
slowly
by
adding
a
delay
to
the
trigger
event
each
sweep
what
was
the
scopes
actual
sampling
rate
at
the
time
how
is
the
data
being
massaged
after
capture
but
before
display
etc
one
common
misconception
is
the
speed
of
the
scope
is
the
hp
scope
youre
using
really
a
mhz
scope
or
is
it
a
mhz
sample
rate
scope
mhz
single
shot
significance
whose
front
end
including
sh
can
support
mhz
waveforms
important
for
equivalent
time
sampling
the
mhz
input
in
this
case
really
only
helps
you
when
your
waveform
is
repetitive
or
on
a
single
sample
when
you
get
lucky
and
hit
a
transient
event
during
a
sample
time
so
there
are
a
lot
more
variables
in
understanding
how
to
get
useful
information
from
a
digital
scope
i
prefer
an
analog
scope
for
general
use
and
the
digital
for
events
where
i
need
storage
for
later
analysis
or
comparison
when
the
event
is
within
the
capability
of
the
scope
now
for
the
price
of
true
mhz
digital
scopes
to
fall
