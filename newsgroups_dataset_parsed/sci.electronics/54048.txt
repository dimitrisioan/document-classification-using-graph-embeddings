WRITES
ACTUALLY
DETECTING
A
BREAK
IS
DONE
BY
WATCHING
FOR
A
CHARACTER
CONTAINING
ALL
ZERO
BITS
WITH
THE
FRAMING
ERROR
RESULTING
FROM
ITS
RECEIPT
THIS
TRUE
ENOUGH
BUT
MEANS
THAT
THE
LINE
STAYED
IN
THE
ZERO
BIT
STATE
EVEN
PAST
THE
STOP
BIT
TIME
SLOT
WHICH
BASICALLY
INDICATES
A
BREAK
THERE
IS
NO
SPECIAL
WAY
TO
DETECT
BREAK
THAT
I
HAVE
FOUND
OTHER
THAN
THIS
THERES
NO
