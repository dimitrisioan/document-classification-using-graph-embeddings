i
have
a
mosfet
pulled
out
of
a
trygon
power
supply
for
which
i
have
no
manual
its
a
motorola
part
with
a
date
code
and
the
number
which
the
motorola
folks
assure
me
is
a
house
number
which
they
cant
help
me
with
any
suggestions
from
folks
out
there
i
cant
put
it
on
a
curve
tracer
to
try
to
get
an
equivalent
since
its

scott
since
your
mosfet
is
a
vintage
its
probably
not
a
very
good
one
by
todays
standards
if
you
have
an
idea
about
its
voltage
and
current
ratings
eg
you
can
probably
get
away
with
replacing
it
with
anything
with
better
specs
early
mosfets
had
a
gatesource
voltage
rating
of
approximately
vdcmax
and
they
would
usually
turn
completely
on
at
otherwise
mosfets
are
not
really
mysterious
theyre
more
or
less
voltage
controlled
current
sources
if
the
mosfet
in
your
circuit
is
used
as
an
openloop
voltage
controlled
current
source
you
may
have
to
experiment
with
various
gainaltering
techniques
