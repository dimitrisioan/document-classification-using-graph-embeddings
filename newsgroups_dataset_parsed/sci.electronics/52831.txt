homemade
ir
remote
extender
heres
a
question
for
all
you
electrical
engineers
out
there
i
bought
an
infrared
detector
module
at
radio
shack
for
it
is
a
little
gizmo
that
senses
infrared
remotes
and
produces
an
output
signal
then
i
hooked
the
output
through
a
transistor
to
an
infrared
led
the
circuit
works
like
a
minature
remote
control
extender
in
my
car
all
remote
commands
are
relayed
to
the
cd
player
hidden
in
the
glove
compartment
it
works
fine
with
my
denon
cd
player
but
when
i
tried
to
build
the
same
circuit
for
a
friends
vcr
it
didnt
work
the
circuit
appears
to
work
for
other
remotes
you
can
see
infrared
with
a
sony
ccd
camcorder
but
coincidentally
it
only
seems
to
work
for
my
cd
player
any
advice
would
be
appreciated
