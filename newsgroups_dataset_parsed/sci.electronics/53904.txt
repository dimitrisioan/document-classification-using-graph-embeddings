while
driving
through
the
middle
of
nowhere
i
picked
up
knx
am
a
clearchannel
station
based
in
los
angeles
they
had
an
ad
claiming
that
they
were
able
to
get
traffic
flow
information
from
all
of
the
thousands
of
traffic
sensors
that
caltrans
has
placed
under
the
pavement
does
caltrans
sell
this
info
does
knx
have
an
exclusive
whats
the
deal
well
they
claim
they
are
the
only
radio
broadcaster
with
this
information
but
the
citys
cable
channel
in
cablevision
areas
shows
this
information
map
during
travel
times
and
i
believe
most
of
the
major
la
freeways
are
covered
the
computergenerated
map
shows
green
yellow
red
or
flashing
red
respectively
and
incidenti
might
be
off
a
little
on
the
speeds
since
this
is
from
memory
i
often
look
at
this
display
in
the
morning
to
see
if
i
really
want
to
fight
the
traffic
on
the
sepulveda
pass
or
work
from
home
for
a
little
while
to
wait
for
it
to
clear
another
poster
explained
the
origin
of
the
information
sensors
embedded
wire
loops
in
the
pavement
near
ramps
and
every
half
mile
or
so
caltrans
has
had
a
big
board
driven
from
this
data
in
their
traffic
control
center
for
some
time
i
dont
know
if
they
are
selling
the
data
or
if
anyone
with
the
equipment
necessary
for
its
transmission
and
display
can
have
it
