wanted
dram
controller
for
use
with
for
an
upcoming
project
i
want
to
use
megs
of
dram
configured
as
two
meg
banks
of
bit
data
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
knows
of
a
dram
controller
which
will
handle
refreshing
the
data
its
ok
if
the
controller
doesnt
handle
bank
switching
that
part
is
easy
the
only
controllers
i
know
of
are
the
ones
out
of
the
national
semiconductor
dram
management
handbook
edition
eg
i
would
like
to
know
if
another
manufacturer
produces
one
which
may
be
easier
to
implement
in
my
circuit
btw
if
anyone
is
wanting
to
hook
up
dram
to
a
microcontroller
dallas
semiconductor
makes
a
neat
chip
the
serial
dram
nonvolatizer
chip
it
uses
the
spi
bus
and
refreshescontrols
up
to
of
dram
memory
it
can
use
an
external
battery
to
refresh
the
dram
when
the
power
is
off
price
is
from
dallas
quan
i
wish
i
could
use
this
chip
but
its
maximum
spi
clock
rate
is
mhz
too
slow
for
me
thanks
in
advance
