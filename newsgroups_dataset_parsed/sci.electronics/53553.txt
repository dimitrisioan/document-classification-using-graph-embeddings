WRITES
HELLO
IVE
GOT
A
PROBLEM
WITH
MY
CD
PLAYER
SONY
IN
THAT
IT
REFUSES
TO
PLAY
DISCS
MORE
THAN
A
MINOR
INCONVENIENCE
THE
PLAYER
ITSELF
DOESNT
RECOGNISE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DISC
IN
ITS
AN
INTERMITANT
PROBLEM
BUT
ONE
THAT
IS
BECOMING
MORE
FREQUENT
IS
THIS
A
COMMON
PROBLEM
WITH
OLDER
CD
PLAYERS
AND
IF
SO
WHAT
CAN
BE
DONE
TO
RECTIFY
IT
IF
THERE
IS
NO
OBVIOUS
ANSWER
HOW
CAN
I
BEGIN
TO
START
FAULT
FINDING
TO
START
OFF
WITH
HOW
DOES
THET
MACH
RECOGNISE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DISC
IN
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
MY
EXPERIENCE
IS
THAT
THE
CD
DRAWER
BECOMES
A
BIT
LOOSE
AND
THE
CD
EITHER
SKIPS
OR
CANT
BE
READ
TRY
SEEING
IF
ALL
THE
SCREWS
THAT
HOLD
DOWN
THE
DRAWER
ASSEMBLY
ARE
TIGHTENED
PROPERLY
OTHER
THAN
THAT
MY
NEXT
GUESS
WOULD
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MOTORS
HOPE
THIS
