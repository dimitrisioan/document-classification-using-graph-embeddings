im
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
operate
a
pioneer
laserdisc
that
i
bought
at
a
surplus
store
it
is
reputedly
from
some
kind
of
computerised
viewing
andor
ordering
system
there
is
what
may
be
an
hpib
connector
on
the
back
when
i
power
it
up
the
front
panel
power
light
comes
on
but
no
activity
and
the
door
doesnt
open
anyone
have
any
experience
with
this
unit
or
any
ideas
on
how
to
obtain
documentation
what
you
have
is
one
of
the
ld
players
from
a
video
game
dragons
lair
space
ace
etc
call
pioneer
technicial
support
at
least
thats
the
number
i
called
them
at
and
ask
for
the
interface
guide
it
shows
how
the
parallel
interface
should
be
wired
and
the
codes
for
the
commands
play
pause
reject
etc
the
guide
is
mainly
for
hooking
the
player
to
a
computer
but
with
a
little
work
you
could
build
a
wired
controller
