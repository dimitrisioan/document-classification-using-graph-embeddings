comments
about

do

ill
toss
in
my
cents
worth
ive
begun
to
think
that
distribution
disks
are
made
on
some
of
the
least
reliable
floppy
disk
stocks
available
weve
been
especially
plagued
by
borlands
distribution
disks
im
lucky
if
i
can
install
from
them
as
many
as
times
before
they
crap
out
on
me
so
definitely
as
a
matter
of
course
we
always
make
copies
to
do
our
installations
