I
WOULD
EXPECT
THAT
CDROM
SOFTWARE
WOULD
NOT
EVEN
NEED
COPY
PROTECTION
AS
THE
PROGRAM
ON
A
CDROM
WOULD
NOT
FIT
ONTO
A
HARDDRIVE
AND
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
THE
AVERAGE
AND
EVEN
NOTSOAVERAGE
USER
TO
WRITE
TO
A
CDROM
COPIES
OF
THE
SOFTWARE
THAT
STILL
WORK
COULD
NEVER
BE
MADE
HMMM
NOW
THAT
I
THINK
ABOUT
IT
WITH
A
CREATIVE
TSR
MAYBE
DISKSWAPPING
COULD
BE
USED
TO
SIMULATE
FILES
ON
A
SINGLE
DISK
YOU
WOULD
NEED
A
TONNE
OF
DISKS
THOUGH
THERE
ARE
MANY
PROGRAMS
ON
CDROM
THAT
FIT
ON
A
HARDDISK
NOT
ALL
SOFTWARE
IS
THAT
BIG
BUT
WERE
GETTING
THERE
GUIDO
KLEMANS
INTERNET
VALID
UNTIL
MAY
LISTEN
VERY
CAREFULLY
I
WILL
SAY
THIS
ONLY
ONES
MICHELLE
OF
THE
RESITANCE
