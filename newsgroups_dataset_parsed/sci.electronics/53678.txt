HOW
HARD
WOULD
IT
BE
TO
SOMEHOW
INTERFACE
THEM
TO
SOME
OF
THE
POPULAR
MOTOROLA
MICROCONTROLLERS
NOT
HARD
YOU
CAN
DO
THE
REFRESHING
AND
ACCESS
CYCLES
BY
SOFTWARE
BUT
THIS
HOGS
MOST
OF
THE
AVAILABLE
CPU
CYCLES
ON
A

SEEN
SOME

FROM
PHILIPS
THAT
USED
ONE
OF
THEIR
DERIVATIVES
AS
A
PRINTER
BUFFER
WITH

OF
DYNAMIC
RAM
THAT
WAS
ACCESSED
AND
REFRESHED
WITH

BITBANGING
ANOTHER
ALTERNATIVE
WOULD
BE
TO
USE
ONE
OF
THOSE
NICE

CONTROLLER
CHIPS
THAT
CREATE
STATIC

APPEARANCE
AND
ALL
THAT
BUT
THEY
MAY
