making

writes
when
constructing
active
filters
odd
values
of
resistor
are
often
required
ie
something
like
a
k
ohm
resistorit
seems
best
to
choose
common
capacitor
values
and
cope
with
the
strange
resistances
then
demanded
is
there
a
pd
program
out
there
that
will
work
out
how
best
to
make
up
such
a
resistance
given
fixed
resistors
of
the
standard
values
per
etc
it
is
a
common
enough
problem
yet
i
cant
recall
seing
a
program
that
tells
that
rxryrz
gives
rq
starting
with
q
and
finding
prefered
values
xy
and
z
i
once
wrote
such
a
program
in
bbc
basic
it
was
very
crude
and
took
around
seconds
to
do
an
exhaustive
search
with
a
small
amount
of
intelligence
and
told
you
the
best
combination
rq
and
the
best
below
rq
if
you
want
to
write
one
just
store
the
prefered
values
in
an
array
and
then
search
the
solution
space
using
three
nested
loops
im
sure
you
could
knock
this
up
in
an
hour
