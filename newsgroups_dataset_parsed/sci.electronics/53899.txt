update
many
thanks
to
those
who
replied
to
my
appeal
for
info
on
a
drive
i
have
which
is
i
now
have
some
information
on
how
to
modify
this
for
use
with
a
bbc
b
computer
not
only
do
you
have
to
change
the
speed
from
to
rpm
tried
that
but
also
change
components
in
the
recplay
section
to
allow
for
the
lower
data
rate
not
as
it
was
designed
for
and
also
change
the
recording
current
to
allow
for
the
low
data
raterev
speed
hopefully
this
should
sort
it
all
out
not
bad
for
quid
normally
quid
and
upwards
the
drive
is
a
jvc
mdp
series
drive
