REPAIRS
I
HAD
THE
GOOD
LUCK
TO
OBTAIN
AN
EICO
DYNAMIC
CONDUCTANCE
TUBE
TESTER
FOR
A
SONG
UNFORTUNATELY
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
OUT
OF
KEY
THE
ONLY
THING
WRONG
WITH
IT
WAS
AN
OPEN
METER
MOVEMENT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHERE
I
CAN
FIND
EITHER
ANOTHER
METER
MOVEMENT
LIKE
IT
A
DEADBUTNOTTHEMETERDEAD
UNIT
OR
SCHEMATICS
TO
SPECIFY
THE
CURRENT
SCALE
OF
THE
METER
MOVEMENT
I
CAN
CUT
AND
PASTE
A
MORE
SENSITIVE
MOVEMENT
IN
IF
I
CAN
FIND
WHAT
THE
FULL
SCALE
CURRENT
WAS
OR
IS
EICO
STILL
CONTACTABLE
THE
THING
IS
A

NOPE
NOT
A

ANY
SORT
OF
