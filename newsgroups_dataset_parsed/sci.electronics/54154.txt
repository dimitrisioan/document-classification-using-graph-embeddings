WHY
DOES
A
LEAD
ACID
BATTERY
DISCHARGE
AND
BECOME
DEAD
TOTALLY
UNUSEABLE
WHEN
STORED
ON
A
CONCRETE
FLOOR
WHEN
WILL
PEOPLE
LEARN
THE
TROUBLE
IS
THE
BALLAST
IN
THE
CONCRETE
AND
AS
EVERY
FOOL
KNOWS
BALLAST
RESISTORS
ARE
USED
TO
DISCHARGE
BATTERIES
FURTHERMORE
IT
IS
VERY
SILLY
TO
STORE
THE
BATTERY
WITH
THE
TERMINALS
DOWNWARDS
AS
YOU
MUST
HAVE
DONE
TO
CONTACT
THE
BALLAST
SERIOUSLY
SELF
DISCHARGE
THE
ACTUAL
PROBLEM
AS
STATED
BY
OTHERS
DOES
VARY
GREATLY
WITH
CERTAIN
TYPES
AND
FREAKS
SHOW
LOW
SELF
DISCHARGE
I
HAVE
IN
FACT
SEEN
ORDINARY
AUTOMOTIVE
BATTERIES
WHICH
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
HELD
FULL
CHARGE
FOR
YEARS
SO
IT
MUST
BE
POSSIBLE
IF
YOUR
GARAGE
IS
HEATED
STORE
THE
BATTERIES
SOMEWHERE
COOLER
BUT
ABOVE
FREEZING
FLAT
BATTERIES
FREEZE
MORE
EASILY
OCCASIONALLY
CHARGE
IT
ONCE
A
MONTH
OR
EVEN
LEAVE
IT
ON
FLOAT
CHARGE
PERMANENTLY
SPECIAL
CHARGER
DONT
DO
THIS
UNLESS
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
SERIOUSLY
DANGEROUS
ANOUTHER
POINT
IS
THE
UNSUITABILITY
OF
AUTOMOTIVE
BATTERIES
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
ELECTRIC
MOWERS
THEY
ARE
NOT
GENERALLY
DESIGNED
TO
BE
REPEATEDLY
DEEP
DISCHARGED
AND
THEIR
LIFE
MAY
BE
GREATLY
SHORTED
SOME
EARLY
ZERO
MAINTENANCE
AUTOMOTIVE
BATTERIES
IN
FACT
RESPONDED
TO
A
FULL
DISCHARGE
WITH
TOTAL
FAILURE
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS
BUT

ONES
ARE
