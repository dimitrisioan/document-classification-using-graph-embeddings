level
brightness
xmas
light
set
for
easter
yes
i
know
its
nowhere
near
christmas
time
but
im
gonna
loose
net
access
in
a
few
days
maybe
a
week
or
if
im
lucky
and
wanted
to
post
this
for
interested
people
to
save
till
xmas
note
bell
labs
is
a
good
place
if
you
have
a
phd
and
a
good
boss
i
have
neither
subject
xmas
light
set
with
levels
of
brightness
another
version
of
a
variable
brightness
xmas
light
set
this
set
starts
with
a
blinker
bulb
string
diagram
orginal
way
set
b
modified
set
for
level
brightness
string
string
b
rtn
note
no
mods
to
wiring
to
the
right
of
this
point
only
one
blinker
is
used
note
that
the
blinker
would
not
have
as
much
current
thru
it
as
the
string
bulbs
because
of
the
second
string
of
bulbs
in
parallel
with
it
thats
why
the
use
of
the
resistor
here
to
add
extra
current
thru
the
blinker
to
make
up
for
the
current
shunted
thru
the
second
string
while
the
blinker
is
glowing
and
the
second
string
is
not
glowing
when
the
blinker
goes
open
this
resistor
has
only
a
slight
effect
on
the
brightness
of
the
strings
slightly
dimmer
slightly
brighter
or
use
a
bulb
in
place
of
the
resistor
if
you
can
get
one
caution
do
not
replace
with
a
standard
bulb
as
these
draw
too
much
current
and
burn
out
the
blinker
approx
what
youll
see
when
its
working
powerup
string
will
light
at
full
brightness
and
b
will
be
lit
bypassing
most
of
the
current
from
the
second
string
making
them
not
light
b
will
open
placing
both
strings
in
series
making
the
string
that
was
out
to
glow
at
a
low
brightness
and
the
other
string
that
was
on
before
to
glow
at
reduced
brightness
be
sure
to
wire
and
insulate
the
splices
resistor
leads
and
cut
wires
in
a
safe
manner
