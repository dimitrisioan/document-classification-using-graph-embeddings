NOTE
NO
MODS
TO
WIRING
TO
THE
RIGHT
OF
THIS
POINT
ONLY
ONE
BLINKER
IS
USED
NOTE
THAT
THE
BLINKER
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
AS
MUCH
CURRENT
THRU
IT
AS
THE
STRING
BULBS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SECOND
STRING
OF
BULBS
IN
PARALLEL
WITH
IT
THATS
WHY
THE
USE
OF
THE
RESISTOR
HERE
TO
ADD
EXTRA
CURRENT
THRU
THE
BLINKER
TO
MAKE
UP
FOR
THE
CURRENT
SHUNTED
THRU
THE
SECOND
STRING
WHILE
THE
BLINKER
IS
GLOWING
AND
THE
SECOND
STRING
IS
NOT
GLOWING
WHEN
THE
BLINKER
GOES
OPEN
THIS
RESISTOR
HAS
ONLY
A
SLIGHT
EFFECT
ON
THE
BRIGHTNESS
OF
THE
STRINGS
SLIGHTLY
DIMMER
SLIGHTLY
BRIGHTER
OR
USE
A
BULB
IN
PLACE
OF
THE
RESISTOR
IF
YOU
CAN
GET
ONE
CAUTION
DO
NOT
REPLACE
WITH
A
STANDARD
BULB
AS
THESE
DRAW
TOO
MUCH
CURRENT

BURN
