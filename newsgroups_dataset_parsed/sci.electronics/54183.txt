i
hate
hard
copy
manuals
and
would
rather
have
all
docs
online
not
because
i
want
to
copy
the
program
but
because
its
usually
faster
and
and
convenient
than
sifting
through
an
old
book
i
cant
find
just
mho
but
i
prefer
hardcopy
books
because
you
can
have
three
or
four
of
them
open
spread
across
the
bed
next
to
the
desk
in
my
dorm
and
reference
them
while
using
the
program
fullscreen
the
windows
help
things
come
closest
to
good
online
documentation
ive
seen
but
they
generally
arent
detailed
enough
and
would
probably
take
a
large
amount
of
space
even
compressed
which
is
at
a
premium
on
my
system
in
fact
the
manuals
are
the
primary
reason
i
bought
borlands
c
compiler
instead
of
using
the
one
the
lab
licensed
in
the
lab
of
course
ive
got
a
shelf
full
of
books
to
help
me
out
when
im
stuck
to
each
his
own
it
is
also
much
easier
to
scribble
corrections
on
a
hardcopy
manual
