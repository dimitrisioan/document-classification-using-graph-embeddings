MY
MONITOR
DISPLAY
HAS
A
BAD
CASE
OF
THE
WIGGLIES
I
HAVE
A
GOOD
GROUND
I
LIVE
IN
AN
OLD
HOUSE
AND
I
HAVE
REPLACED
MUCH
OF
THE
WIRING
I
HAVE
TWO
EMI
FILTERS
ON
THE
COMPUTER
THE
MONITOR
PLUGS
INTO
THE
COMPUTER
WHEN
FLUORESCENT
LIGHTS
ARE
ON
UPSTAIRS
THE
DISPLAY
JIGGLES
WHEN
MOTORS
RUN
IN
THE
HOUSE
THE
DISPLAY
JIGGLES
WHEN
INCANDESCENT
LIGHTS
ARE
ON
IN
THE
KITCHEN
THE
DISPLAY
JIGGLES
I
COULD
BRING
A
SEPARATE
LINE
FROM
THE
BREAKER
BOX
AND
USE
IT
ONLY
FOR
THE
COMPUTER
WOULD
THIS
DO
IT
EMI
DOESNT
ONLY
TRAVEL
THE
VOLT
LINE
THOUGH
SHOULD
I
SHIELD
THE
BACK
OF
THE
MONITOR
GROUND
A
GRID
OR
PLATE
YOUR
EXPERTISE
IS
APPRECIATED
THANKS
VERY
MUCH
ED
BYRNES
AAAHH
A
PROBLEM
VERY
NEAR
AND
DEAR
TO
MY
HEART
IN
OUR
CASE
OTHER
MONITORS
CAUSE
THIS
PROBLEM
THE
DEFLECTION
COIL
OF
OTHER
MONITORS
TO
BE
SPECIFIC
HAVE
ALSO
SEEN
A
MONITOR
BACKED
UP
TO
A
FUSE
PANEL
EXHIBIT
THIS
PROBLEM
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOUR
PROBLEM
SINCE
FLOURESCENT
LITES
MOTORS
ETC
SEVERAL
OF
FEET
AWAY
SEEM
TO
ME
TO
BE
TOO
FAR
TO
CAUSE
IT
BUT
THE
JUICE
RUNNING
TO
THEM
MUST
PASS
NEARBY
YOUR
MONITOR
FUSEBOX
ON
OTHER
SIDE
OF
WALL
MAYBE
WE
STARTED
SPECING
PANASONIC
VIDEO
MONITORS
SWITCHABLE

LINESVID
AUD
SVHS
ON
ONE
THIS
STOPPED
THE
WAVY
INTERFERENCE
EFFECT
ON
THE
COMPUTER
MONITOR
NEXT
TO
IT
NOW
ON
TO
YOUR
PROBLEM
YOU
NEED
WHAT
IS
KNOWN
AS
MU
SHIELDING
VERY
COMMON
IN
FACT
ALMOST
MANDATORY
ON
ELECTROSTATIC
DEFLECTION
TYPE
OSCOPES
I
TALKED
TO
A
EE
PROF
HE
SAID
GET
A
COFFEE
CAN
CUT
BOTH
ENDS
OFF
MOUNT
AROUND
DEFLECTION
COIL
OF
INTERFERING
MONITOR
BE
CAREFUL
TO
AVOID
ALL
HIGH
VOLTAGE
CIRCUITRY
ESPECIALLY
THE
THICKER
HIGH
VOLTAGE
ANODE
LEAD
USUALLY
COLORED
RED
IF
YOU
KILL
YOURSELF
DONT
BLAMESUE
ME
USE
PLASTIC
OR
OTHER
NONCONDUCTING
STANDOFFS
AND
SUCH
TO
MOUNT
CAN
NOW
I
WOULD
ASSUME
THAT
WHAT
IS
GOOD
FOR
KEEPING
MAG
FIELDS
IN
IS
ALSO
GOOD
AT
KEEPING
THEM
OUT
SO
HOPEFULLY
THISLL
WORK
BY
MOUNTING
SHIELD
ON
MONITOR
BEING
INTERFERED
WITH
AS
WELL
IF
NOT
START
SHIELDING
