CALEB
STROCKBINE
WRITES
COULD
MAKE
FOR
SOME
INTERESTING
CHOREOGRAPHY
LIGHT
AND
SOUND
COULD
BE
CONTROLLED
DIRECTLY
BY
THE
POSITION
OF
A
DANCER
ON
STAGE
OR
BY
THE
NUMBER
OF
DANCERS
ON
STAGE
NEAT
YOU
COULD
EVEN
BUILD
A
SPOTLIGHT
THAT
FOLLOWS
THE
DANCER
AROUND
ON
STAGE
CAN
YOU
TELL
US
MORE
ABOUT
WHAT
YOURE
DOING
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
VERY
COOL
PROGRAM
TIS
ONLY
A
GLEAM
IN
MY
EYE
AT
THIS
POINT
I
HAVE
YET
TO
CHOSE
A
TRACKING
METHOD
THE
INITIAL
REQUIREMENT
WAS
TO
DESIGN
A
SYSTEM
TO
LOCATE
A
DANCER
IN
ONE
OF
EIGHT
ZONES
ACROSS
THE
STAGE
I
DID
SOME
EXPERIMENTS
WITH
PYROELECTRIC
DETECTORS
AND
FOUND
THEM
DIFFICULT
TO
ALIGN
TO
GET
A
DEFINITE
ZONE
TRANSITION
AND
DANCERS
STAND
STILL
ALOT
SO
THEIR
IR
SIGNATURE
GOES
AWAY
THE
GOOD
THING
ABOUT
PRYOELECTRICS
IS
THAT
THEIR
SIGNAL
IS
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
WARM
BODY
OR
BODY
PART
AND
THE
VELOCITY
OF
SAID
BODY
THIS
COULD
BE
USEFUL
FOR
DETECTING
THE
INTENSITY
OF
A
DANCE
GESTURE
DANCERS
ALSO
REALLY
HATE
TO
WEAR
LITTLE
BOXES
AND
BATTERIES
STRAPPED
ON
THEIR
BODIES
BUT
THEY
REALLY
NEED
TO
BE
EMITTING
SOME
KIND
OF
SIGNAL
TO
BE
TRACKED
THE
CURRENT
TOY
I
HAVE
BEEN
WORKING
WITH
IS
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
MANDALA
FOR
THE
AMIGA
USED
WITH
A
LIVE
VIDEO
DIGITIZER
THIS
WORKS
WITH
A
VIDEO
CAMERA
TRAINED
ON
THE
STAGE
YOU
CAN
SET
THRESHOLDS
FOR
A
ZONE
WITHIN
THE
FIELD
OF
VIEW
AND
AN
OBJECT
BRIGHTER
THAN
THE
THRESHOLD
WILL
TRIGGER
AN
EVENT
EVENTS
CAN
BE
MIDI
OBJECTS
OR
SEQUENCES
AMIGA
SOUNDS
OR
GRAPHIC
OBJECTS
ITS
BEEN
FUN
TO
PLAY
WITH
BUT
THE
DOCUMENTAION
IS
ARCANE
AND
THE
DIGITIZER
IS
NOISY
STILL
ITS
VERY
APPEALING
THE
DANCERS
DONT
HAVE
TO
WEAR
ANY
APPLIANCES
YOU
CAN
HAVE
OTS
OF
ZONES
IT
SPEAKS
MIDI
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
TO
CONTROL
LIGHTS
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
BUILD
ANY
ELECTRONICS
ITS
ALL
DONE
WITH
LIGHTING
AND
VIDEO
BRIGHTNESS
AND
CONTRAST
ADJUSTMENTS
I
HAVE
YET
TO
DO
ANYTHING
PARTICULARLY
USEFUL
OR
ARTISTIC
BUT
I
HAVE
HOPES
