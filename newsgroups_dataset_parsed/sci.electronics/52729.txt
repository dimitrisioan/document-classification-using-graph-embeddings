hi
c
i
have
a
computer
to
use
with
an
ad
board
c
for
data
acquisition
on
an
at
busim
having
problems
c
the
at
bus
runs
at
mhz
correct
so
there
should
c
be
no
bus
speed
conflict
but
i
read
somewhere
that
the
c
new
mhz
cpu
runs
on
a
mhz
bus
is
that
for
c
the
local
bus
or
the
at
bus
also
if
so
then
i
have
a
problem
c
c
when
i
run
on
nonturbomode
the
speed
goes
to
mhz
and
the
c
ad
doesnt
work
please
mail
your
views
thanks

the
standard
at
bus
isa
runs
at
not
mhz
but
some
nonstnadard
isa
buses
do
have
higher
clock
rates
but
be
careful
since
some
boards
dont
work
with
faster
than
standard
rates
for
instance
my
has
adjustable
at
bus
speeds
and
my
audio
card
chokes
when
i
do
ad
data
acquisition
with
a
bus
speed
faster
than
the
fact
that
nonturbomode
speed
ad
doesnt
work
is
weird
you
may
have
a
motherboard
with
a
hardware
bug
mhz
bus
on
the
does
refer
to
the
local
bus
fyi
the
at
bus
operates
asynchronously
and
is
linked
to
the
local
bus
via
a
bus
interface
which
is
one
function
