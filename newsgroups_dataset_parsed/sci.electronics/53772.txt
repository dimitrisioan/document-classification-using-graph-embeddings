ive
recently
picked
up
some
display
chips
but
i
cant
find
any
information
on
them
it
seems
they
are
no
longer
made
by
ti
and
i
dont
have
an
old
enough
data
book
it
appears
to
have
a
dotmatrix
led
display
capable
of
showing
one
hex
digit
it
is
in
a
pin
dip
package
but
pins
and
are
not
present
if
you
have
any
information
on
this
part
pinout
power
requirments
functions
please
send
me
email
thank
you
