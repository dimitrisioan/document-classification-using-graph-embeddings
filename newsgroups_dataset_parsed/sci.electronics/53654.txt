the
rub
if
you
draw
enough
current
to
light
an
led
th
mcequipment
at
the
phone
company
will
think
youve
gone
off
hook
mcin
the
onhook
state
youre
not
supposed
to
draw
current
ok
lets
have
some
calculation
here
going
by
australian
standards
which
i
presume
might
be
similar
to
other
countries
if
not
lets
have
some
input
a
phone
uses
to
loop
a
line
a
standard
led
drains
so
what
is
the
actual
loop
current
required
for
an
off
hook
indication
do
you
know
up
to
microamperes
on
hook
over
something
like
ma
off
hook
in
between
defective
line
and
the
phone
company
comes
looking
for
leaky
insulation
