re
los
angeles
freeway
traffic
reports
while
driving
through
the
middle
of
nowhere
i
picked
up
knbr
am
a
clearchannel
station
based
in
los
angeles
they
had
an
ad
claiming
that
they
were
able
to
get
traffic
flow
information
from
all
of
the
thousands
of
traffic
sensors
that
caltrans
has
placed
under
the
pavement
does
caltrans
sell
this
info
does
knbr
have
an
exclusive
whats
the
deal

claar
you
were
right
the
second
time
it
is
knx
believe
it
or
not
i
also
listen
to
knx
in
the
evenings
here
in
colorado
its
kind
of
fun
driving
through
the
country
listening
to
traffic
jams
on
the
back
to
your
original
question
yes
there
are
sensors
just
past
every
onramp
and
offramp
on
the
freeways
theyre
the
same
sensors
used
at
most
stoplights
now
coils
in
the
pavement
you
might
want
to
give
caltrans
a
call
or
even
ask
bill
keene
knxs
traffic
reporter
i
doubt
if
just
anyone
can
get
the
information
but
it
would
be
worth
asking
just
in
case
you
can
get
it
