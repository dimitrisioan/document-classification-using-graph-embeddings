dimming
incand
lamps
whats
the
latest
and
greatest
way
to
dim
incandescent
lamps
march
circuit
cellar
has
part
one
of
an
article
about
dimming
lamps
but
it
seems
to
lead
into
phase
control
as
the
best
method
for
controlling
brightness
ive
always
hated
phasecontrol
for
the
rfi
buzzing
filaments
and
nonlinear
adjustment
range
i
had
heard
that
you
can
modulate
the
ac
line
on
a
cycle
by
cycle
basis
to
get
better
results
to
cut
the
lamps
power
to
you
would
givemsay
cycles
of
ac
then
nothing
for
another
cycles
i
wonder
if
anyone
has
tried
this
or
knows
what
the
pro
stuff
is
using
any
advice
is
appreciated
