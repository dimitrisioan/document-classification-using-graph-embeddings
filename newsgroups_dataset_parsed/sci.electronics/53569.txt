IN

WEVE
CONSCIOUSLY
GIVEN
A
FEW
RECOMMENDATIONS
THAT
ARE
IN

OF

BECAUSE
WE
FEEL
THAT
ITS
REASONABLE
AND
WILL
IMPRESS
THE
INSPECTOR
THE
INSPECTOR
WILL
KNOW
THAT
YOURE
AN
AMATEUR
YOU
HAVE
TO
EARN

THE
BEST
WAY
OF
DOING

IS
TO
SPEND
YOUR

DOING
AS
NEAT
A
JOB
AS
POSSIBLE
DONT

CORNERS
EXCEED

OTHERWISE
THE
INSPECTOR
MAY

AND
FAULT
YOU
ON
THE
SLIGHTEST
TRANSGRESSIONS
DONT
TRY
TO
HIDE
ANYTHING
FROM
THE
INSPECTOR
USE
THE
PROPER
TOOLS
IE
DONT
USE
A
BREAD
KNIFE
TO
STRIP
WIRES
OR
TWIST
WIRES
WITH
YOUR
FINGERS
THE
INSPECTOR
WONT
LIKE
IT
AND
THE
RESULTS
WONT
BE
THAT
SAFE
AND
IT
TAKES
LONGER
AND
YOURE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
STICK
A
HUNK
OF

THROUGH
YOUR
HAND
THAT
WAY
DONT
HANDLE

WHEN

SO
WE
SUGGEST
YOU
CONSULT
YOUR

ABOUT
YOUR

A
HINT
BUY
A

OF
BRIGHT
YELLOW

THAT
SAYS
BURIED
POWER

AND
BURY
IT
A
FEW
INCHES
ABOVE
WHERE
THE

HAS
BEEN
PLACED
SUBJECT
ALUMINUM
WIRING
DURING
THE
ALUMINUM
INSTEAD
OF
COPPER
WIRING
BECAME
QUITE
POPULAR
AND
WAS
EXTENSIVELY
USED
SINCE
THAT
TIME
ALUMINUM
WIRING
HAS
BEEN
IMPLICATED
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
HOUSE
FIRES
AND
MOST
JURISDICTIONS
NO
LONGER
PERMIT
IT
IN
NEW
INSTALLATIONS
WE
RECOMMEND
EVEN
IF
YOURE
ALLOWED
TO
THAT
DO
NOT
USE
IT
FOR
NEW
WIRING
BUT
DONT
PANIC
IF
YOUR
HOUSE
HAS
ALUMINUM
WIRING
ALUMINUM
WIRING
WHEN
PROPERLY
INSTALLED
CAN
BE
JUST
AS
SAFE
AS
COPPER
ALUMINUM
WIRING
IS
HOWEVER
VERY
UNFORGIVING
OF
IMPROPER
INSTALLATION
WE
WILL
COVER
A
BIT
OF
THE
THEORY
BEHIND
POTENTIAL
PROBLEMS
AND
WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
TO
MAKE
YOUR
WIRING
SAFE
THE
MAIN
PROBLEM
WITH
ALUMINUM
WIRING
IS
A
PHENOMENON
KNOWN
AS
COLD
CREEP
WHEN
ALUMINUM
WIRING
WARMS
UP
IT
EXPANDS
WHEN
IT
COOLS
DOWN
IT
CONTRACTS
UNLIKE
COPPER
WHEN
ALUMINUM
GOES
THROUGH
A
NUMBER
OF
WARMCOOL
CYCLES
IT
LOSES
A
BIT
OF
TIGHTNESS
EACH
TIME
TO
MAKE
THE
PROBLEM
WORSE
ALUMINUM
OXIDISES
OR
CORRODES
WHEN
IN
CONTACT
WITH
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
METAL
SO
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
THE
CONNECTION
GOES
UP
WHICH
CAUSES
IT
TO
HEAT
UP
AND
CORRODE
OXIDIZE
STILL
MORE
EVENTUALLY
THE
WIRE
MAY
START
GETTING
VERY
HOT
MELT
THE
INSULATION
OR
FIXTURE
ITS
ATTACHED
TO
AND
POSSIBLY
EVEN
CAUSE
A
FIRE
SINCE
PEOPLE
USUALLY
ENCOUNTER
ALUMINUM
WIRING
WHEN
THEY
MOVE
INTO
A
HOUSE
BUILT
DURING
THE
WE
WILL
COVER
BASIC
POINTS
OF
SAFE
ALUMINUM
WIRING
WE
SUGGEST
THAT
IF
YOURE
CONSIDERING
PURCHASING
A
HOME
WITH
ALUMINUM
WIRING
OR
HAVE
DISCOVERED
IT
LATER
THAT
YOU
HIRE
A
LICENSED
ELECTRICIAN
OR
INSPECTOR
TO
CHECK
OVER
THE
WIRING
FOR
THE
FOLLOWING
THINGS
FIXTURES
EG
OUTLETS
AND
SWITCHES
DIRECTLY
ATTACHED
TO
ALUMINUM
WIRING
SHOULD
BE
RATED
FOR
IT
THE
DEVICE
WILL
BE
STAMPED
WITH
ALCU
OR
COALR
THE
LATTER
SUPERSEDES
THE
FORMER
BUT
BOTH
ARE
SAFE
THESE
FIXTURES
ARE
SOMEWHAT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
THE
ORDINARY
ONES
WIRES
SHOULD
BE
PROPERLY
CONNECTED
AT
LEAST
WAY
AROUND
THE
SCREW
IN
A
CLOCKWISE
DIRECTION
CONNECTIONS
SHOULD
BE
TIGHT
WHILE
REPEATED
TIGHTENING
OF
THE
SCREWS
CAN
MAKE
THE
PROBLEM
WORSE
DURING
THE
INSPECTION
IT
WOULD
PAY
OFF
TO
SNUG
UP
EACH
CONNECTION
NOTE
THAT
ALUMINUM
WIRING
IS
STILL
OFTEN
USED
FOR
THE
MAIN
SERVICE
ENTRANCE
CABLE
IT
SHOULD
BE
INSPECTED
PUSHIN
TERMINALS
ARE
AN
EXTREME
HAZARD
WITH
ALUMINUM
WIRE
ANY
CONNECTIONS
USING
PUSHIN
TERMINALS
SHOULD
BE
REDONE
WITH
THE
PROPER
SCREW
CONNECTIONS
IMMEDIATELY
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NO
SIGNS
OF
OVERHEATING
DARKENED
CONNECTIONS
MELTED
INSULATION
OR
BAKED
FIXTURES
ANY
SUCH
DAMAGE
SHOULD
BE
REPAIRED
CONNECTIONS
BETWEEN
ALUMINUM
AND
COPPER
WIRE
NEED
TO
BE
HANDLED
SPECIALLY
CURRENT
CANADIAN
CODES
REQUIRE
THAT
THE
WIRE
NUT
USED
MUST
BE
SPECIALLY
MARKED
FOR
CONNECTING
ALUMINUM
TO
COPPER
THE
NEC
REQUIRES
THAT
THE
WIRE
BE
CONNECTED
TOGETHER
USING
SPECIAL
CRIMP
DEVICES
WITH
AN
ANTIOXIDANT
GREASE
THE
TOOLS
AND
MATERIALS
FOR
THE
LATTER
ARE
QUITE
EXPENSIVE
NOT
PRACTICAL
TO
DO
IT
YOURSELF
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
RENT
THE
TOOL
ANY
NONRATED
RECEPTACLE
CAN
BE
CONNECTED
TO

BY
MEANS
OF
A
SHORT
COPPER
PIGTAIL
SEE

SHOWS
REASONABLE
WORKMANSHIP
NEAT

PROPERLY
STRIPPED
NOT
NICKED

ETC
IF
WHEN
CONSIDERING
PURCHASING
A
HOME
AN
INSPECTION
OF
THE
WIRING
SHOWS
NO
PROBLEMS
OR
ONLY
ONE
OR
TWO
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
CAN
CONSIDER
THE
WIRING
SAFE
IF
THERE
ARE
SIGNS
OF
PROBLEMS
IN
MANY
PLACES
WE
SUGGEST
YOU
LOOK
ELSEWHERE
IF
THE
WRONG
RECEPTACLES
ARE
USED
YOU
CAN
REPLACE
THEM
WITH
THE
PROPER
TYPE
OR
USE
PIGTAILS

YOU

BUT
ITS
GENERALLY
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
HIRE
AN
INSPECTOR
TO
LOOK
THROUGH

FOR

NOT
JUST
FOR

IF

WE
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
CAN

SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
WIRING
STYLES
HAVE
COME
AND
GONE
WHEN

AN

YOU
MAY
ENCOUNTER
SOME
OF
THIS
STUFF
THIS
SECTION
DESCRIBES
THE
OLD
METHODS
AND
SOME
OF
THEIR
IDIOSYNCRASIES
THE
OLDEST
WIRING
SYSTEM
YOURE
LIKELY
TO
ENCOUNTER
IS
CALLED
KNOB
AND
TUBE
KT
IT
IS
MADE
UP
OF
INDIVIDUAL
CONDUCTORS
WITH
A
CLOTH
INSULATION
THE
WIRES
ARE
RUN
ALONG
SIDE
STRUCTURAL
MEMBERS
EG
JOISTS
OR
STUDS
USING
CERAMIC
STANDOFFS
KNOBS
WIRE
IS
RUN
THROUGH
STRUCTURAL
MEMBERS
USING
CERAMIC
TUBES
CONNECTIONS
WERE
MADE
BY
TWISTING
THE
WIRE
TOGETHER
SOLDERING
AND
WRAPPING
WITH

SINCE
THE
HOT
AND
NEUTRAL
WERE
RUN
SEPARATELY
THE
WIRING
TENDS
TO
BE
RATHER
CONFUSING
A
NEUTRAL
OFTEN
RUNS
DOWN
THE
CENTRE
OF
EACH

WITH
TAPS
OFF
TO
EACH
FIXTURE
THE
HOT
WIRE
TENDED
TO
RUN
FROM
ONE
FIXTURE
TO
THE
NEXT
IN
SOME
CASES
KT
ISNT
COLOURCODED
SO
THE
NEUTRAL
IS
OFTEN
THE
SAME
COLOUR
AS
THE
HOT
WIRES
YOULL
SEE
KT
IN
HOMES
BUILT
AS
LATE
AS
THE
COMMENTS
ON
KT
THE
PEOPLE
INSTALLING
KT
WERE
PRETTY
PARANOID
ABOUT
ELECTRICITY
SO
THE
WORKMANSHIP
TENDS
TO
BE
PRETTY
GOOD
THE
WIRE
INSULATION
AND
INSULATORS
TEND
TO
STAND
UP
VERY
WELL
MOST
KT
IVE
SEEN
FOR
EXAMPLE
IS
IN
QUITE
GOOD
CONDITION
NO
GROUNDING
GROUNDING
IS
USUALLY
DIFFICULT
TO
INSTALL
BOXES
ARE
SMALL
RECEPTACLE
REPLACEMENT
PARTICULARLY
WITH
GFCI
CAN
BE
DIFFICULT
NO
BUSHING
ON
BOXES
EITHER
SO
WIRING
CHANGES
NEED
SPECIAL
ATTENTION
TO
BOX
ENTRY
SOMETIMES
THE
NEUTRAL
ISNT
BALANCED
VERY
WELL
BETWEEN
SEPARATELY
HOT
CIRCUITS
SO
IT
IS
SOMETIMES
POSSIBLE
TO
OVERLOAD
THE
NEUTRAL
WITHOUT
EXCEEDING
THE
FUSING
ON
ANY
CIRCUIT
BUILDING
CODE
DOES
NOT
PERMIT
INSULATION
IN

THAT
CONTAIN
KT
CONNECTION
TO
EXISTING
KT
FROM
NEW
CIRCUITS
CAN
BE
TRICKY
CONSULT
YOUR
INSPECTOR
MODERN
WIRING
PRACTISE
REQUIRES
CONSIDERABLY
MORE
OUTLETS
TO
BE
INSTALLED
THAN
KT
SYSTEMS
DID
SINCE
KT
TENDS
TO
BE
IN
PRETTY
DECENT
CONDITION
IT
GENERALLY
ISNT
NECESSARY
TO
REPLACE
IT
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
ITS
KT
WHAT
YOU
SHOULD
WATCH
OUT
FOR
IS
RENOVATIONS
THAT
HAVE
INTERFERED
WITH
IT
AND
BE
CAUTIOUS
ABOUT
CIRCUIT
LOADING
IN
MANY
CASES
ITS
PERFECTLY
REASONABLE
TO
LEAVE
EXISTING
KT
ALONE
AND
ADD
NEW
FIXTURES
ON
NEW
CIRCUITS
USING
MODERN
TECHNIQUES
AFTER
KT
THEY
INVENTED
MULTICONDUCTOR
CABLE
THE
FIRST
TYPE
YOU
WILL
SEE
IS
ROUGHLY
A
CLOTH
AND
VARNISH
INSULATION
IT
LOOKS
MUCH
LIKE
THE
ROMEX
CABLE
OF
THE
LAST
DECADE
OR
TWO
THIS
STUFF
WAS
USED
IN
THE
AND
AGAIN
NO
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
IT
WAS
INSTALLED
MUCH
LIKE
MODERN
WIRING
ITS
MAJOR
DRAWBACK
IS
THAT
THIS
TYPE
OF
INSULATION
EMBRITTLES
WEVE
SEEN
WHOLE
SYSTEMS
WHERE
THE
INSULATION
WOULD
FRACTURE
AND
FALL
OFF
AT
A
TOUCH
BX
CABLE
OF
THE
SAME
VINTAGE
HAS
SIMILAR
PROBLEMS
THIS
STUFF
IS
VERY
FRAGILE
AND
BECOMES
RATHER
HAZARDOUS
IF
THE
WIRES
BECOME
BARE
THIS
WIRING
SHOULD
BE
LEFT
UNTOUCHED
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
WHENEVER
AN
OPPORTUNITY
ARISES
REPLACE
IT
A
SIMPLE
RECEPTACLE
OR
SWITCH
REPLACEMENT
CAN
TURN
INTO
A
SEVERAL
HOUR
LONG
FRUSTRATING
FIGHT
WITH

TUBING
AFTER
THIS
WIRING
TECHNIQUE
THE
MORE
MODERN

WAS
INVENTED
ITS
ALMOST
A

IMPREGNATED

OFTEN
A

STICKY
THIS
STUFF
STANDS
UP
REASONABLY
WELL
AND
DOESNT
PRESENT
A
HAZARD
AND
IS
REASONABLY
EASY
TO
