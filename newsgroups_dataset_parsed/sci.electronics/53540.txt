I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
PEOPLE
HAD
ANY
GOOD
USES
FOR
OLD
SIMMS
I
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
THEM
FOR
THE
APPLE
MAC
AND
I
KNOW
LOTS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
DO
TO
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
SELL
THEM
BUT
HAVE
GOTTEN
NO
INTEREST
WE
USE
THEM
AS
CHRISTMAS
TREE
DECORATIONS
THE
CAT
DOESNT
EAT
THESE
YES
BUT
THEY
DONT
LOOK
APPROPRIATE
I
MUCH
PREFER
USED
TUBES
ON
MY
TREE
