allife
of
me
i
cant
remember

it
is
the
telephone
technicians
aluse
it
all
the
time
we
used
to
play
around
with
this
in
our
aldorm
rooms
since
there
were
multiple
phone
lines
running
between
alrooms
it
probably
wouldnt
help
for
you
to
post
the
number
since
it
appears
to
be
different
in
each
area
for
what
its
worth
in
the
new
orleans
area
the
number
is
easy
to
remember
what
slmr

i
dont
know
ill
make
up
something
here
in
our
city
dialing
either
newer
exchanges
or
sic
will
get
a
synthesized
message
works
great
for
having
people
call
you
back
at
unlabeled
pay
phones
