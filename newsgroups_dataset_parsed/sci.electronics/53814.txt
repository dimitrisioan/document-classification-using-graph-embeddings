i
was
looking
at
the
amps
diagram
for
sony
receivers
and
i
was
amazed
to
find
a
difference
between
the
us
and
canadian
model
on
the
capacitors
that
hangs
off
the
output
to
the
speakers
to
speaker
identical
both
models
from
amp
idnetical
both
models
canadian
model
only
us
model
and
worldwide
model
only
candian
model
only
gound
the
board
itself
is
also
identical
with
room
for
all
three
caps
the
uscan
versions
is
clearly
indicated
in
both
places
how
does
that
make
sense
is
essentially
for
caps
there
are
just
standard
caps
no
special
wtypeprecision
please
explain
this
michael

the
only
explanation
i
can
think
of
is
that
two
capacitors
in
series
can
handle
twice
the
output
voltage
sometimes
two
elcos
in
antiseries
you
know
positive
sides
facing
eachother
are
used
to
obtain
a
large
capacitor
that
can
handle
positive
and
negative
voltages
as
well
so
there
probably
is
no
designphilosophical
reason
but
a
productioncost
