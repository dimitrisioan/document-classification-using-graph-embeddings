RE
SWITCHING
PS
QUESTIONS
ANYWAYS
IVE
BUILT
THE
BASIC
UP
DOWN
CONVERTERS
WITH
PRETTY
GOOD
RESULTS
EFFICIENCY
BUT
IM
RUNNING
INTO
PROBLEMS
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
DESIGN
BUILD
ANYTHING
THAT
PUTS
OUT
SERIOUS
AMPS
I
KNOW
IT
CAN
BE
DONE
I
HAVE
SOME
GUTS
ON
MY
BENCH
BUT
SOMETHING
PUZZLES
ME
IM
USING
A
SIMPLE
CHOKE
AS
THE
STORAGE
ELEMENT
BASICLY
A
TOROID
WITH
A
SINGLE
WINDING
BUT
ALL
COMMERCIAL
MODELS
USE
TRANSFORMERS
WITH
MANY
WINDINGS
I
TRACED
A
FEW
AND
THEY
SEEM
TO
USE
SOME
OF
THE
WINDING
FOR
THE
USUAL
ERRORFEEDBACK
BUT
SOME
OF
THE
OTHERS
SEEM
TO
LOOSE
ME
WHAT
ARE
THEY
FOR
BETTER
THAN
THAT
ANYONE
HAVE
A
FULL
SCHEMATIC
FOR
ONE
OF
THESE
THAT
I
COULD
GET
A
COPY
OF
ID
LOVE
TO
SEE
HOW
THEY
MANAGE
TO
SQUEEZE
OUT
SO
MUCH
FROM
SUCH
LOW
VOLUME
MOST
COMMERCIAL
SWITCHERS
DO
NOT
USE
MAGNETICS
FOR
THEIR
ENERGY
STORAGE
THATS
HANDLED
BY
THE
BIG
CAPS
ON
THE
PRIMARY
SIDE
THOSE
WHICH
IN
A
LINEARLYREGULATED
POWER
SUPPLY
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
THE
FILTER
CAPS
COMING
RIGHT
AFTER
THE
BRIDGE
THE
TRANSFORMER
IS
JUST
THAT
A
TRANSFORMER
ITS
THERE
PRIMARILY
TO
STEP
THE
VOLTAGE
UP
OR
DOWN
ALTHOUGH
THE
INDUCTANCE
SEEN
BY
THE
SWITCH
TRANSISTOR
ON
THE
PRIMARY
SIDE
IS
NOT
NEGLIGIBLE
AS
ANYONE
WHOS
ZAPPED
SAID
TRANSISTOR
FROM
EITHER
FAILING
TO
GET
ONE
WITH
A
HIGH
ENOUGH
BREAKDOWN
VOLTAGE
OR
NEGLECTING
TO
INCLUDE
A
SNUBBER
DIODE
ACROSS
IT
WOULD
TELL
YOU
ACTUALLY
MANY
TRANSISTORS
INTENDED
FOR
SWITCHER
USE
TODAY
HAVE
THE
DIODE
BUILT
IN
THE
BASIC
SWITCHEDMODE
POWER
SUPPLY
OPERATES
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
IN
A
SOMEWHAT
SIMPLIFIED
MANNER
THE
AC
LINE
IS
RECTIFIED
TO
PRODUCE
A
HIGH
VOLTAGE
MOREORLESS
UNREGULATED
DC
RAIL
THE
ENERGY
STORAGE
OR
FILTER
CAPS
APPEAR
ACROSS
THIS
RAIL
AS
DOES
THE
SWITCHING
TRANSISTOR
THE
TRANSISTOR
CHOPS
THE
CURRENT
INTO
THE
PRIMARY
SIDE
OF
THE
TRANSFORMER
RESULTING
IN
STEPPEDUP
OR
STEPPEDDOWN
PULSES
OUT
THE
SECONDARY
WHICH
ARE
THEN
RECTIFIED
AND
FILTERED
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THE
TRANSFORMERS
OUTPUTS
IS
SAMPLED
AND
FED
BACK
TO
THE
CONTROL
CIRCUIT
FOR
THE
SWITCHING
TRANSISTOR
WHICH
ACTS
IN
A
PULSEWIDTH
MODULATION
PWM
FASHION
TO
CONTROL
BY
VARYING
THE
PULSE
WIDTH
THE
AMOUNT
OF
ENERGY
BEING
DUMPED
INTO
THE
PRIMARY
AND
THEREFORE
THE
VOLTAGE
COMING
OUT
AT
THE
SECONDARY
THE
REMAINING
OUTPUTS
MAY
BE
ALLOWED
TO
SIMPLY
RUN
AT
WHATEVER
VALUE
THEY
WILL
MOREORLESS
TRACKING
THE
REGULATED
OUTPUT
OR
THEY
MAY
HAVE
SOME
ADDITIONAL
LINEAR
REGULATION
ADDED
YOU
MAY
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
THE
FEEDBACK
BETWEEN
THE
REGULATED
OUTPUT
AND
THE
PWM
CONTROL
WHICH
IS
MOST
TYPICALLY
AN
IC
IS
NOT
DONE
VIA
A
DIRECT
ELECTRICAL
CONNECTION
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
VARIOUS
SAFETY
STANDARDS
WHICH
REQUIRE
PRIMARY
AND
SECONDARY
CIRCUITS
TO
BE
ELECTRICALLY
ISOLATED
OFTEN
THE
FEEDBACK
PATH
INVOLVES
AN
OPTOISOLATOR
TO
MEET
THIS
REQUIREMENT
WHILE
THE
TRANSFORMER
ISNT
THE
PRIMARY
ENERGYSTORAGE
DEVICE
IN
THESE
DESIGNS
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THE
ENERGY
STORED
IN
THE
TRANSFORMER
CAN
BE
IGNORED
BESIDES
THE
INDUCTIVE
KICK
GIVING
THE
SWITCH
TRANSISTOR
A
BAD
TIME
AS
NOTED
ABOVE
YOU
ALSO
NEED
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
GETTING
ALL
THE
ENERGY
THAT
WENT
IN
TO
THE
TRANSFORMER
BACK
OUT
AGAIN
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
IN
SOME
DESIGNS
THIS
HAPPENS
MORE
OR
LESS
AUTOMATICALLY
BUT
IN
OTHERS
YOU
NEED
TO
TAKE
SPECIAL
CARE
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
TRANSFORMER
CORE
DOESNT
SATURATE
WHICH
AGAIN
WOULD
HAVE
DISASTROUS
RESULTS
BEST
LEFT

THE
IMAGINATION

NOT
