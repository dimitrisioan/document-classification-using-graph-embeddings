MY
MOMS
MAGNAVOX
DOES
THIS
AS
WELL
I
PUT
CHEWING
GUM
ALL
AROUND
THE
HORIZONTAL
SYNC
TRANSFORMER
SO
IT
WOULDNT
RESONATE
THE
BOARD
AS
MUCH
DONT
FLAME
IT
WORKED
I
REALIZE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
MORE
SUITABLE
SUBSTANCE
AVAILABLE
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
BUT
I
DONT
REMEMBER
WHAT
AND
WHERE
IT
IS
ADHESIVE
SILICON
FROM

IF
IT
SMELLS
LIKE
VINEGAR
IT
MAY
DAMAGE
METAL

CORROSION
ANYBODY
TRIED
SUPERGLUE
CYANOACRYLATE
THIS
SHOULD
SNEAK
INTO
THE
CRACKS
BETTER
AND
IS
STIFFER
THAN
SILICONE
IVE
FOUND
THIS
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
ON

TRANSFORMER
CORES
AND

THE
KIND
LIKEWISE
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
TRIED
THIS
ON
A
FLYBACK
ID
LIKE
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
IT
I
WOULD
SUSPECT
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
AS
EFFECTIVE
AS
IT
WAS
ON
POWER
TRANSFORMERS
AS
THE
MATERIAL
WOULDNT
DAMP
AS
WELLSOMETHING
I
SUSPECT
WOULD
BE
CRITICAL
AT
THE
FREQUENCIES
INVOLVED
IN
OTHER
WORDS
YOU
WANT
ABSORPTION
RATHER
THAN
PREVENTION

WOULD
BE
