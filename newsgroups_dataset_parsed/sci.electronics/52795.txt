re
why
is
telephone
audio
hz
telephone
systems
have
the
capability
of
a
passband
of
to
the
reason
they
do
not
implement
this
is
it
is
not
backward
compatable
to
every
telephone
system
in
addition
the
most
effecent
mix
of
electrical
effecency
and
intelegability
closly
mateches
a
passband
close
but
no
banana
to
paraphrase
garfield
the
reason
hz
is
used
is
that
voice
channels
used
to
occupy
bands
when
multiplexed
on
a
trunk
line
therefore
at
the
bottom
and
at
the
top
of
this
band
were
filtered
to
minimise
interference
with
the
next
band
nowadays
digital
trunks
have
made
this
less
relevant
but
the
phone
companies
still
see
no
reason
to
improve
quality
especially
for
free
therefore
digital
chunk
of
a
trunk
segments
still
have
a
guaranteed
bandwidth
of
only
so
they
can
carry
the
equivalent
of
one
analog
line
at
the
clock
rate
of
a
standard
pcm
or
digital
trunk
its
all
historical
here
in
the
uk
the
bandwidth
restriction
apparently
only
apply
to
local
lines
ie
those
used
by
the
average
domestic
client
private
lines
which
are
run
from
the
local
exchange
to
the
leasing
client
are
usually
capable
of
a
higher
bandwidth
if
the
exchange
is
digital
dont
quote
me
on
that
but
i
think
i
remember
a
bt
engineer
saying
something
to
that
effect
when
i
was
doing
some
work
shadowing
a
few
years
ago
