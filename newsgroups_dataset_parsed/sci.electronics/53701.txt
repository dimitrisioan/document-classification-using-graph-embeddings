AD
BOARD
QUIRY
ON
AN
AD
BOARD
IVE
GOT
IM
USING
THE
AD
LINES
IT
MEASURES
THE
VOLTAGES
PROPERLY
IE
WITH
A
POWER
SUPPLY
IT
REGS
AND
WITH
IT
REGS
PROBLEM
IS
WHEN
IVE
GOT
THE
INPUT
VOLTAGE
AND
I
WISH
TO
LOWER
IT
VIA
A
RESISTOR
THE
SENSITIVITY
OF
THE
BOARD
IS
SO
GREAT
THAT
I
CAN
TRIGER
IT
WITH
HOLDING
THE
WIRE
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
TOUCH
THE
PROBE
AND
IT
WILL
REGISTER
THE
FULL
INPUT
VOLTAGE
A
RESISTOR
ONLY
LOWERS
VOLTAGE
BY
SO
THIS
IS
NOT
TOO
FEESABLE
WHAT
COULD
THE
PROBLEMS
BE
AND
WHAT
ELSE
COULD
I
USE
TO
LOWER
THE
INPUT
VOLTAGE
BTW
IVE
GOT
IT
GROUNDED
CORRECTLY
INSPIRATION
