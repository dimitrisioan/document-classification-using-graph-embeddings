WRITES
IM
WANTING
TO
BUILD
A
SIMPLE
UPS
FOR
MY
PC
SUSTAIN
THE
COMPUTER
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
COMPLETE
THE
CURRENT
TASK
AND
SAVE
TO
MINUTES
SHOULD
BE
ENOUGH
I
THINK
THOUGH
I
DONT
REALLY
NEED
TO
KEEP
THE
MONITOR
ACTIVE
I
CAN
TRY
TO
REMEMBER
WHAT
TO
DO
SO
MAYBE
I
CAN
AVOID
A
DCAC
INVERTER
AND
JUST
USE
A
BATTERY
TO
DIRECTLY
SUPPLY
THE
MOTHERBOARD
AND
PERIPHERALS
NOW
THERES
A
GOOD
IDEA
ALL
YOU
NEED
IS
AMPS
DC
FOR
A
FEW
MINUTES
AND
A
GOOD
WETWARE
MEMORY
WAS
I
USING
WP
OR
AUTOCAD
OR
I
THOUGHT
OF
THE
SAME
IDEA
MYSELF
A
FEW
DAYS
AGO
IVE
GOT
A
FAIRLY
NEW
CAR
BATTERY
THAT
I
TAKE
ALONG
IN
MY
WHEN
I
GO
CAMPING
AND
IT
SITS
AROUND
USELESS
WHEN
IM
HOME
I
WISH
I
COULD
GET
A
BATTERYLESS
UPS
TO
USE
IT
WITH
OR
USE
IT
WITH
A
HEAVY
DUTY
REGULATOR
TO
SUPPLY
THE
PC
BUT
I
GUESS
YOUD
NEED
AND
AND
TOO
MORE
BATTERIES
AN
ALTERNATIVE
WOULD
BE
TO
LEAVE
A
AMP
BATTERY
CHARGER
HOOKED
UP
TO
THE
BATTERY
AND
RUN
A
TO
CONVERTER
RUNNING
ALL
THE
TIME
AND
WHEN
THE
POWER
GOES
OUT
VOILA
THE
CONVERTER
KEEPS
ON
RUNNING
OFF
THE
BATTERY
AND
THEN
I
COULD
TAKE
THE
CONVERTER
AND
MY
COMPUTER
ON
THE
CAMPING
