im
wanting
to
build
a
simple
ups
for
my
pc
sustain
the
computer
long
enough
to
complete
the
current
task
and
save
to
minutes
should
be
enough
i
think
though
i
dont
really
need
to
keep
the
monitor
active
i
can
try
to
remember
what
to
do
so
maybe
i
can
avoid
a
dcac
inverter
and
just
use
a
battery
to
directly
supply
the
motherboard
and
peripherals
now
theres
a
good
idea
all
you
need
is
amps
dc
for
a
few
minutes
and
a
good
wetware
memory
was
i
using
wp
or
autocad
or
i
thought
of
the
same
idea
myself
a
few
days
ago
ive
got
a
fairly
new
car
battery
that
i
take
along
in
my
when
i
go
camping
and
it
sits
around
useless
when
im
home
i
wish
i
could
get
a
batteryless
ups
to
use
it
with
or
use
it
with
a
heavy
duty
regulator
to
supply
the
pc
but
i
guess
youd
need
and
and
too
more
batteries
an
alternative
would
be
to
leave
a
amp
battery
charger
hooked
up
to
the
battery
and
run
a
to
converter
running
all
the
time
and
when
the
power
goes
out
voila
the
converter
keeps
on
running
off
the
battery
and
then
i
could
take
the
converter
and
my
computer
on
the
camping
trips
