hi
volt
from
battery
i
need
a
small
battery
powered
hi
voltage
capacitive
discharge
supply
to
deliver
joules
at
volts
this
implies
a
cap
i
have
built
a
very
satisfactorily
operating
version
from
a
but
do
not
like
the
idea
of
using
a
single
source
part
it
seems
that
the
ubiquitous
camera
flash
circuit
is
what
i
want
but
i
cant
get
mine
apart
without
breaking
it
i
would
appreciate
receiving
the
circuit
description
or
a
source
of
one
i
have
already
looked
in
several
electronics
circuits
handbooks
to
no
avail
