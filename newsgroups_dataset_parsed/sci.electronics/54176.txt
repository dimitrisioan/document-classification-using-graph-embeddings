needed
fan
can
someone
tell
me
where
to
find
watt
ma
fans
that
fit
the
standard
computer
mounting
size
ie
and
inch
wide
and
inches
diagonal
from
hole
to
hole
holewhere
bolt
or
screw
goes
through
i
have
found
higher
noisy
fans
that
are
v
watt
but
i
need
a
quite
fan
i
can
use
volt
as
well
but
found
just
about
all
volt
fans
to
be
noisy
i
also
find
that
the
v
fans
are
not
only
quieter
but
the
blade
shape
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
i
have
a
dead
fan
that
was
quiet
in
its
day
it
has
long
blades
like
fan
blades
in
a
tturbo
engine
on
a
jet
is
the
only
way
i
can
describe
it
the
dead
fan
is
etri
model
actually
its
not
dead
it
just
makes
a
hideous
rattle
noise
so
its
stealthy
qualities
are
void
thanks
