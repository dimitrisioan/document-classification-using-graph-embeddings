I
HAVE
A
PROJECT
IN
MIND
THAT
REQUIRES
AN
ARRAY
OF
LEDS
THAT
CAN
BE
ADDRESSED
INDIVIDUALLY
BY
A
MICROPROCESSOR
SAY
OR
SO
IS
THERE
AN
LSI
THAT
IS
DESIGNED
TO
DRIVE
AN
LED
ARRAY
INCLUDING
RAM
TO
HOLD
THE
ARRAY
STATE
OR
FAILING
THAT
SOME
WAY
OF
MULTIPLEXING
THE
DISPLAY
SO
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
LATCH
A
BIT
FOR
EACH
LED
USING
A
DISCRETE
LATCH
I
WANT
TO
AVOID
HAVING
A
HUGE
BOARD
COVERED
WITH
IF
POSSIBLE
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
MAXIM
MAKES
A
CHIP
THAT
DOES
EXACTLY
WHAT
YOU
WANT
THE
DRIVES
SEGMENT
LED
DISPLAYS
WITH
FULL
DECODE
OR
DRIVES
DISCRETE
LEDS
WITH
A
WIRE
SERIAL
INTERFACE
THE
CHIPS
CAN
ALSO
BE
CASCADED
TO
ALLOW
VERY
LARGE
ARRAYS
I
AM
WORKING
ON
A
SIGN
DISPLAY
USING
THIS
PART
ILL
HAVE
TO
POST
THE
CONTACT
INFO
FOR
MAXIM
LATER
ITS
AT
