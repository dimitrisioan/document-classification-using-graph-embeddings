THE

USED
BY

IS
CONSIDERABLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE

USED
BY
LASER
PRINTERS
ESPECIALLY
THE
NEWER
LASER
PRINTERS
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEM
IS
DUMB
LASER
DRIVERS
THAT
SEND
A
RASTER
END
COMMAND
AFTER
EACH

LINE
THIS
MAKES
NO
MATERIAL
DIFFERENCE
FOR
LASERS
BUT
CAUSES
THE
DESKJET
TO
PRINT
THE
ACCUMULATED
RASTER
AS
YOU
MIGHT
GUESS
THE
RESULT
IS
HIDEOUSLY
SLOW

GUILTY

THE

THAT
PERMITS
A

TO
BE
RENDERED
WITH

ONE
MEGABYTE
OF

AN
UNCOMPRESSED
IMAGE
COULD
BE
AS
LARGE
AS

BUT
THE

NEEDS
ABOUT

FOR
ITS
INTERNAL
HOUSEKEEPING

A

THIS
IS
FASTER
THAN
ANY
BUT
THE
MOST
TRIVIAL
PRINTING
FROM
A

PRINTER
THE
PRESUMPTION
OF

BEING
THAT
THE

PRINTER
HAS
COMPLETED
ITS

CYLE
UNTIL

CHANGED
WICKING
RESULTING

UNAVOIDABLE
I
WONT
USE
THE
WORD
IMPOSSIBLE
BUT
MATCHING

FROM
A

IS
UNLIKELY
CHOSING
AN
APPROPRIATE
PAPER

HELPS
BUT
DOES
NOT
ELIMINATE
THE
PROBLEM

MORE
WASTFUL

THE

I
CASE
CONFIRM
EVENTUALLY
DO

OUT
THE
USUAL
SYMPTOM
IS
THAT
THE

BECOMES
RELUCTANT

THE

JOB
FOR
A

I
HAVE
DISASSEMBLED
AND
REASSEMBLED
THE

ON
MY

IT
DEPENDS
UPON
THE

WHICH

IS
BEST
FOR
YOU
IF
YOU
ONLY
