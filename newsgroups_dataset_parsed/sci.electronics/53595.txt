what
do
nuclear
sites

i
really
dont
know
where
to
post
this
question
so
i
figured
that
this
board
would
be
most
appropriate
i
was
wondering
about
those
massive
concrete
cylinders
that
are
ever
present
at
nuclear
poer
sites
they
look
like
cylinders
that
have
been
pinched
in
the
middle
does
anybody
know
what
the
actual
purpose
of
those
things
are
i
hear
that
theyre
called
cooling
towers
but
what
the
heck
do
they
cool
i
hope
someone
can
help
this
is
definitely
the
wrong
newsgroup
for
this
but
never
mind
any
machine
powered
by
heat
motor
steam
or
gasturbine
steamengine
thermoelementetc
work
the
better
the
bigger
the
temperature
difference
between
input
and
output
is
because
you
never
get
all
thermic
energy
out
of
the
powering
medium
steam
burning
gaz
etc
you
have
to
eliminate
the
rest
of
the
energy
to
keep
the
efficency
high
a
thermal
electric
power
plant
coal
oil
or
atomic
power
works
just
the
same
way
you
heat
water
steam
to
power
the
turbine
and
generators
because
you
dont
get
the
whole
energy
out
of
the
steam
efficency
is
never
you
have
to
cool
down
this
steam
again
by
something
else
most
power
plants
use
cooling
towers
for
this
purpose
some
type
of
megarefrigerator
others
use
water
of
a
river
ecologically
not
unobjectionable
got
it
