RE
LASER
VS
BUBBLEJET
FYI
THE
ACTUAL
HORIZONTAL
DOT
PLACEMENT
RESOUTION
OF
AN
HP
DESKJET
IS
INCH
THE
ELECTRONICS
AND
DYNAMICS
OF
THE
INK
CARTRIDGE
HOWEVER
LIMIT
YOU
TO
GENERATING
DOTS
AT
PER
INCH
ON
ALMOST
ANY
PAPER
THE
INK
WICKS
MORE
THAN
INCH
ANYWAY
THE
METHOD
OF
DEPOSITING
AND
FUSING
TONER
OF
A
LASTER
PRINTER
RESULTS
IN
MUCH
LESS
SPREAD

DROP
TECHNOLOGY
IT
DOESNT
TAKE
MUCH
INVESTIGATION
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
MECHANICAL
AND
ELECTRONIC
COMPLEMENT
OF
A
LASER
PRINTER
IS
MORE
COMPLEX
THAN
INEXPENSIVE
INK
JET
PRINTERS
RECALL
ALSO
THAT
LASER
PRINTERS
OFFER
A
MUCH
HIGHER
THROUGHPUT
PPM
FOR
A
LASER
VERSUS
ABOUT
PPM
FOR
AN
INK
JET
PRINTER
SOMETHING
ELSE
TO
THINK
ABOUT
IS
THE
COST
OF
CONSUMABLES
OVER
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
PRINTER
