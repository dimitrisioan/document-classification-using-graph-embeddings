KA
LUN
PANG
WRITES
I
BORROWED
A
VHS
TAPE
FROM
A
FRIEND
AND
IT
HAS
A
WARNING
IN
THE
BEGINING
SAYING
THAT
ATTEMPTS
TO
COPY
THE
TAPE
WILL
RESULT
IN
DESTROYING
THE
COPY
AND
THE
ORIGINAL
I
FOUND
THIS
UNBELIEVABLE
AS
PLAYING
AND
RECORDING
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
PROCESSES
HOWEVER
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
THIS
TAPE
BEING
SOLD
ANYWHERE
SO
I
DONT
WANT
TO
TAKE
THE
CHANCE
EVEN
ITS
SMALL
ANYONE
HAS
EXPERIENCE
IN
THIS
KIND
OF
SELFDESTRUCTING
VIDEO
TAPES
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
IF
I
WANTED
TO
SEND
THE
POLICE
A
TAPE
WITH
A
RANSOM
DEMAND
ON
IT
OR
SEND
CNN
A
VIDEO
TAPE
TO
SEE
IF
THEY
WANTED
TO
BUY
IT
I
WOULD
PLACE
A
SMALL
MAGNET
NEAR
THE
TAKEUP
SPOOL
SO
THE
TAPE
WOULD
BE
ERASED
AS
IT
WAS
PLAYED
WHO
WOULD
THINK
TO
CHECK
