i
borrowed
a
vhs
tape
from
a
friend
and
it
has
a
warning
in
the
begining
saying
that
attempts
to
copy
the
tape
will
result
in
destroying
the
copy
and
the
original
i
found
this
unbelievable
as
playing
and
recording
are
two
different
processes
however
ive
never
seen
this
tape
being
sold
anywhere
so
i
dont
want
to
take
the
chance
even
its
small
anyone
has
experience
in
this
kind
of
selfdestructing
video
tapes
i
have
always
thought
that
if
i
wanted
to
send
the
police
a
tape
with
a
ransom
demand
on
it
or
send
cnn
a
video
tape
to
see
if
they
wanted
to
buy
it
i
would
place
a
small
magnet
near
the
takeup
spool
so
the
tape
would
be
erased
as
it
was
played
who
would
think
to
check
