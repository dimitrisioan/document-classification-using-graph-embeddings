MICROPHONES
I
REMEMBER
BACK
BEFORE
COMMERCIAL
MIKES
WITH
THE
PZM
LABEL
FOR
PRESSURE
ZONE
MICROPHONE
STARTED
SHOWING
UP
I
READ
AN
ARTICLE
IN
SOME
ENGINEERING
JOURNAL
THAT
DESCRIBED
THE
PRINCIPLES
INVOLVED
ALL
THE
PHYSICS
ASIDE
FROM
A
PRACTICLE
STANDPOINT
THE
AUTHORS
SAID
THEY
BUILT
A
PROTOTYPE
WITH
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
SMALL
SONY
LAVELIER
MIKE
LAID
UP
AGAINST
A
LARGE
ALUMINUM
DISK
IN
DEMONSTRATING
IT
AT
A
PRESENTATION
TO
AUDIO
ENGINEERS
THIS
WAS
IMPRESSIVE
ENOUGH
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
PRESENT
WERE
BUGGING
THEM
ABOUT
WHERE
THEY
COULD
BUY
THEM
ANYWAYI
WANT
TO
BUILD
SOME
TO
USE
AS
CHOIR
MIKES
WIDE
COVERAGE
IVE
HAD
GOOD
LUCK
USING
SOME
SMALL
ELECTRET
MIKE
ELEMENTS
I
GOT
FROM
DIGIKEY
MOST
OF
THESE
ARE
LIMITEDBANDWIDTH
PEAKEY
UNITS
BUT
FOR
A
BUCK
OR
TWO
MORE
I
GOT
THE
ONES
SPECD
TO
GO
OUT
TO
WITH
A
BIT
FLATTER
RESPONSE
THE
DISTANCE
OF
THE
MIKE
OPENING
FROM
THE
FLAT
PLATE
IS
KIND
OF
CRITICAL
IM
DEBATING
WHETHER
TO
MOUNT
IT
ON
ITS
SIDE
WHICH
PUTS
THE
OPENING
A
SHADE
UNDER
FROM
THE
PLATE
OR
MOUNTING
IT
WITH
THE
OPENING
ACTUALLY
POINTING
DOWN
INTO
THE
PLATE
AT
A
SMALL
CLEARANCE
I
HAVENT
DISSECTED
A
UNIT
LIKE
YOU
CAN
BUY
AT
RADIO
SHACK
TO
SEE
HOW
THEY
