how
to
reduce
the
rpms
of
a
boxer
fan
yes
you
increase
the
rpm
slip
of
a
boxer
type
fan
by
installing
a
capacitor
in
series
with
the
fans
power
supply
the
air
flow
of
small
inch
fans
can
be
reduced
by
about
by
using
a
to
uf
capacitor
use
a
good
grade
nonpolarized
unit
with
working
voltage
rating
around
volts
note
that
some
impriical
study
is
usually
required
to
experimentally
determine
the
best
size
capacitor
for
a
given
application
for
dc
powered
applications
try
the
radio
shack
volt
box
fan
it
can
run
and
start
reliably
from
as
low
as
about
vdc
it
is
exceptionally
quiet
but
at
admittedly
low
flow
i
wish
i
knew
who
made
the
fans
for
radio
shack
