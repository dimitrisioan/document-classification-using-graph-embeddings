re
how
to
the
disks
copy
protected
i
wrote
a
commercial
program
called
gamemaker
can
you
guess
what
it
does
what
we
do
is
have
a
document
protect
answer
question
on
page
x
line
y
which
is
a
real
pain
we
also
allow
the
user
to
register
by
sending
in
a
card
and
computing
a
based
on
their
name
the
system
works
in
that
weve
gotten
lots
of
registration
cards
i
hear
that
the
program
has
been
cracked
though
someone
two
people
actually
called
up
my
supportone
with
a
question
the
other
wanting
to
buy
our
graphics
libraries
right
anyway
if
anyone
wants
to
help
me
catch
a
cracker
and
has
the
cracked
version
mail
me
i
wont
accuse
you
unless
youre
the
cracker
of
course
i
know
of
at
least
one
ftpsite
from
which
you
can
download
the
cracks
of
about
any
commercial
game
in
existence
the
names
of
the
companies
yes
companies
are
also
blatantly
advertised
with
the
crack
codes
according
to
them
it
is
not
illegal
at
least
in
the
usa
according
to
a
statute
or
something
to
remove
the
copy
protection
from
any
program
the
only
condition
is
that
you
may
only
use
this
code
on
legally
owned
software
for
your
own
convenience
if
there
is
any
interest
i
will
download
the
advertisement
of
one
such
company
i
will
not
give
the
name
of
this
ftpsite
to
anyone
even
if
only
to
protect
the
companies
which
wrote
the
original
games
disclaimer
i
do
not
condone
the
use
or
cracking
of
any
programs
i
believe
it
hurts
the
industry
and
individuals
in
the
long
run
on
the
subject
of
copy
protection
most
pirates
dont
give
a
damn
about
using
software
on
which
the
name
of
the
registered
owner
came
up
on
starting
the
program
they
just
dont
have
a
conscience
