THERE
ARE
A
VARIETY
OF
WATERPROOF
HOUSINGS
I
COULD
USE
BUT
THE
REAL
MEAT
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
ELECTRONICSHENCE
THIS

WHAT
KIND

WOULD
BE
RELIABLE
UNDERWATER
IN
MURKY
OR
EVEN
NIGHTTIME
CONDITIONS
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
SOUND
IS
FEASIBLE
GIVEN
THE
DISTORTION
UNDER

DIRECTION
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
ACCURATE
BUT
RANGE
COULD
BE
RELATIVELY
SHORT
I
IMAGINE
OR
HUNDRED

WOULD
BE
MORE
THAN

SOON
AFTER

ROGERS
WAS

THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
THAT
ALL
ANTENNAS
THAT
ARE
GROUNDED
SEND
HALF
OF
THEIR
SIGNAL
THRU
THE
GROUND
THE
HALF
THAT
TRAVELS
THRU

IS
QUICKLY
DISSAPATED
BY
THE

BUT
THAT
WHICH
TRAVELS
THRU
THE

DOES
NOT
DISAPATE
