RE
WANTED
A
TO
D
HARDWARE
FOR
A
PC
IN
BRAD
WRIGHT
WRITES
IF
YOU
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
PCS
IBM
COMP
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
THE
JOYSTICK
PORT
THOUGH
I
HAVENT
TRIED
THIS
MYSELF
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THE
PORT
HAS
BUILT
IN
AD
CONVERTERS
THIS
WOULD
ALLOW
THE
JOYSTICK
TO
BE
A
COUPLE
OF
POTS
IF
YOU
COULD
FIND
THE
SPECS
THIS
MIGHT
JUST
WORK
FOR
YOU
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
AD
CONVERTERS
FOUND
ON
A
JOYSTICK
PORT
ARE
REALLY
TIMERS
THAT
TICK
OFF
HOW
LONG
IT
TAKES
AN
RC
CIRCUIT
THE
R
BEING
YOUR
PADDLE
TO
CHARGE
UP
TO
SOMETHING
LIKE
VCC
FOR
GAMES
THIS
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
BUT
YOU
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
TRY
TO
TAKE
LAB
MEASUREMENTS
OFF
SOMETHING
AS
NONLINEAR
AS
THAT
HMM
I
SUPPOSE
YOU
COULD
LINEARIZE
IT
IN
SOFTWARE
BUT
THE
REAL
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
PRECISION
OF
YOUR
MEASUREMENT
IS
NO
LONGER
CONSTANT
HIGHER
VOLTAGES
WOULD
BE
MORE
PRECISE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
AND
PERHAPS
THE
GAME
CARD
DESIGNERS
SPLURGED
FOR
THE
EXTRA
TO
MAKE
A
CHEAP
CONSTANT
CURRENT
SOURCE
OUT
OF
AN
OP
AMP
BUT
I
WOULDNT
EXPECT
THAT
JOEL
KOLSTAD
