ps
any
really
good
books
on
amfm
theory
along
with
detailed
electrical
diagrams
would
help
a
lot
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
theory
books
with
no
circuits
and
a
lot
of
circuit
books
with
no
theory
but
one
without
the
other
does
not
help
mixers
have
a
wide
variety
of
implementations
the
minicircuits
part
you
mention
is
a
doublybalanced
diode
mixer
but
active
ones
bjt
fet
seem
more
popular
in
consumer
receivers
you
might
call
mcl
they
have
a
nice
catalog
the
universal
answer
for
widecoverage
theorypractice
rf
design
is
the
arrl
handbook
published
by
the
american
radio
relay
league
the
radio
amateur
organization
any
technical
bookstore
can
order
you
one
the
book
is
superb
with
lots
of
accessible
theory
construction
projects
and
generally
interesting
stuff
you
might
also
check
out
solid
state
design
for
the
radio
amateur
i
think
by
hayward
and
someone
this
has
sharper
design
and
test
information
about
subsystems
like
mixers
