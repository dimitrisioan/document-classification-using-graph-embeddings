RE
ALL
ELECTRONICS
PRESS
AND
PEEL
PCB
TRANSFER
I
THINK
THERE
IS
A
HUGE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
MATERIALS
AND
PROCESS
FOR
PRINTERTONER
PCBS
I
GET
FIRST
TIME
EVERYTIME
RESULTS
FROM
A
LOCAL
HP
POSTSCRIPT
AND
HARDLY
EVER
WORKS
FROM
COPIES
OF
THE
SAME
ARTWORK
THE
PRINTER
RESULTS
ARE
SO
GOOD
THAT
I
HAVE
QUIT
EVEN
LOOKING
FOR
PC
BOARD
PROCESSES
IF
I
HAD
TO
USE
THE
COPIER
VERSION
I
WOULD
THINK
I
WOULD
LOOK
ELSEWHERE
THE
MORAL
EXPERIMENT
AND
FIND
WHAT
WORKS
TONER
TRANSFER
CAN
GIVE
EXCELLENT
RESULTS
IT
LIKE
ANY
PROCESS
GIVES
ERRATIC
RESULTS
WITH
VARIABLE
INPUTS
