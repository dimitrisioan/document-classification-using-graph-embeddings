IT
SEEMS
REASONABLE
TO
ME
THAT
A
MICROWAVE
TRANSMITTERRECEIVER
SETUP
COULD
DO
THE
JOB
FOR
EXAMPLE
SAY
YOU
WANT
TO
MAP
AN
ACRE
LOT
ITD
BE
CONVENIENT
TO
PLACE
MW
TRANSMITTERS
AROUND
THE
LOTS
PERIPHERY
EITHER
OR
AND
THEN
CARRY
A
HANDHELD
RECORDER
AND
WALK
TO
A
POINT
ON
THE
LOT
PRESS
A
BUTTON
AND
THE
COORDS
OF
THE
RECORDERS
LOCATION
IS
STORED
AS
DIGITAL
DATA
WHATS
THE
CHANCE
OF
THIS
WORKING
ANY
SYSTEMS
LIKE
THIS
ALREADY
EXIST
WHAT
KIND
OF
ACCURACY
COULD
YOU
EXPECT
WHAT
WOULD
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
COST
TO
PROTOTYPE
IS
THERE
A
BETTER
ALTERNATIVE
THAN
MICROWAVES
OF
COURSE
YOU
COULD
DEVELOPE
THIS
SYSTEM
BUT
THERE
IS
ALREADY
A
SYSTEM
CALLED
GLOBAL
POSITIONING
SATELLITES
IT
GIVES
THREE
DIMENSIONAL
COORDINATES
ANYWHERE
ON
EARTH
MANY
SURVEYORS
USE
THIS
SYSTEM
WITH
A
DIFFERENTIAL

GET

THATS

ABOUT

THEY

CAN
GUINON
THOUGHT
IT
MEANS
GLOBAL
POSITIONING
SYSTEM
THERE
ARE
TWO
PRECISION
LEVELS
ONE
FOR
ARMY
APPLICATIONS
KILLING
HAS
TO
BE
VERY
ACCURATE
TODAY
AND
ONE
FOR
CIVIL
ONES
THE
CIVIL
PRECISION
IS
ABOUT
TO
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
THOUGH
IT
MAY
BE
INSUFFICIANT
FOR
MAPPING
BUILDINGS
BUT
THERE
IS
A
WAY
WITH
AN
ADDITIONAL
REFERENCE
POINT
EG
ONE
FIXED
GPS
SYSTEM
IN
A
HOUSE
TO
GET
THE
SAME
HIGH
PRECISION
AS
THE
MILITARY
VERSION
BUT
IT
GETS
PRETTY
COMPLICATED
THEN
IF
YOU
USE
A
MICROWAVE
SYSTEM
ACTUALLY
THIS
MEANS
SOME
TYPE
OF
RADAR
YOU
NEED
QUITE
A
LOT
OF
NUMBER
CRUNCHING
TO
GET
ACCURATE
VECTORIZED
DATA
OUT
OF
YOUR
ORIGINAL
SIGNALS
SO
THE
GPS
SYSTEM
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
BETTER
AND
RUNNING
IDEA

YOUR
