IF
YOU
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
PCS
IBM
COMP
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
THE
JOYSTICK
PORT
THOUGH
I
HAVENT
TRIED
THIS
MYSELF
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THE
PORT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
AD
CONVERTERS
FOUND
ON
A
JOYSTICK
PORT
ARE
REALLY
TIMERS
THAT
TICK
OFF
HOW
LONG
IT
TAKES
AN
RC
CIRCUIT
THE
R
BEING
YOUR
PADDLE
TO
CHARGE
UP
TO
SOMETHING
LIKE
VCC
FOR
GAMES
THIS
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
BUT
YOU
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
TRY
TO
TAKE
LAB
MEASUREMENTS
OFF
SOMETHING
AS
NONLINEAR
AS
THAT
THE
BEST
INFO
I
HAVE
SEEN
SO
FAR
IS
THE

OSCILLOSCOPE
DISPLAY
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
READ
THE
JOYSTICK

DIRECTLY
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
USE
BASIC
THE
DETAILED
INFORMATION
FOR
THIS
IS
IN
THE

TECHNICAL
REFERENCE
UNDER
OPTIONS
AND
ADAPTERS
YOU

PROVIDE
SOME
