if
you
know
much
about
pcs
ibm
comp
you
might
try
the
joystick
port
though
i
havent
tried
this
myself
ive
been
told
that
the
port
i
believe
that
the
ad
converters
found
on
a
joystick
port
are
really
timers
that
tick
off
how
long
it
takes
an
rc
circuit
the
r
being
your
paddle
to
charge
up
to
something
like
vcc
for
games
this
works
pretty
well
but
you
certainly
wouldnt
want
to
try
to
take
lab
measurements
off
something
as
nonlinear
as
that
the
best
info
i
have
seen
so
far
is
the
article
joystick
metrics
measuring
physical
properties
through
the
pcs
joystick
port
by
michael
covington
in
the
may
issue
of
pc
tech
journal
it
talks
about
how
to
read
all
kinds
of
things
voltage
current
resistance
in
basic
and
even
includes
code
for
a
simple
oscilloscope
display
its
possible
to
read
the
joystick
port
directly
if
you
dont
want
to
use
basic
the
detailed
information
for
this
is
in
the
pc
technical
reference
under
options
and
adapters
you
have
to
provide
some
millisecond
resolution
timing
functions
but
thats
a
subject
which
has
appeared
many
times
in
articles
from
dr
dobbs
circuit
cellar
ink
etc
look
for
the
public
