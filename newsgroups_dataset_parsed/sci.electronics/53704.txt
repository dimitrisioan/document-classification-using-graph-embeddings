i
have
a
phone
jack
mounted
on
a
wall
i
dont
know
the
number
of
the
line
and
i
dont
want
to
call
up
the
operator
to
place
a
trace
on
it
question
is
there
a
certain
device
out
there
that
i
can
use
to
find
out
the
number
to
the
line
thanks
for
any
response
al
there
usually
is
a
way
however
often
telephone
companies
like
to
keep
all
of
their
internal
numbers
private
depends
on
your
exchange
any
modern
electronic
switching
equipment
usually
have
voice
synth
lines
that
echo
the
number
you
called
from
the
line
service
guys
use
this
to
make
sure
they
connect
up
the
right
pairs
of
lines
