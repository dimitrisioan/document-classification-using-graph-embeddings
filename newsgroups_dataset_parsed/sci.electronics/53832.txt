need
help
with
video
detection
circuit
i
am
trying
to
build
a
circuit
that
detects
the
presence
of
video
vs
a
blank
screen
by
monitoring
the
rg
and
b
outputs
of
a
graphics
card
it
should
be
able
to
detect
the
presence
of
a
single
pixel
at
mhz
which
would
mean
detecting
a
ns
pulse
it
should
also
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
blank
screen
about
mv
and
a
dim
screen
say
around
mv
oh
yes
it
also
needs
to
be
cheap
my
first
circuit
was
a
dismal
failure
i
used
compariators
each
compariator
had
the
input
going
to
one
of
the
guns
the
input
went
to
a
reference
created
by
a
voltage
dividera
potentiometer
the
first
problem
was
that
the
compariator
was
way
too
slow
i
needed
to
get
several
pixels
in
a
row
before
it
would
fire
the
compariators
so
i
could
have
a
whole
screen
full
of
text
but
my
circuit
would
not
detect
it
the
second
problem
is
that
there
was
more
noise
on
the
reference
then
the
smallest
difference
between
a
blank
screen
and
a
dim
screen
in
fact
the
difference
between
completely
black
and
completely
white
is
only
mv
i
am
wondering
if
i
am
going
to
have
to
amplify
the
video
signals
to
make
this
work
there
are
faster
compariators
but
they
are
expensive
and
require
split
supplies
i
would
need
to
replace
my
quad
compariator
with
three
compariators
and
create
a
whole
new
power
supply
circuit
at
this
point
i
think
what
i
need
is
some
sort
of
transistor
circuit
transistors
are
fast
and
cheap
and
should
do
the
trick
unfortunately
i
am
way
out
of
my
league
when
it
comes
to
designing
transistor
circuits
so
i
am
appealing
to
the
net
for
help
any
ideas
tips
circuits
pointers
references
etc
would
be
greatly
appreciated
oh
yes
i
only
sample
the
output
of
this
thing
every
second
or
so
so
i
dont
need
a
fast
response
time
at
all
however
i
havent
found
a
way
to
take
advantage
of
that
fact
thanks
a
lot
for
any
help
anybody
might
be
able
to
give
of
course
you
will
have
my
undying
gratitude
