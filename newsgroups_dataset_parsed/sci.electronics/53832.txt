NEED
HELP
WITH
VIDEO
DETECTION
CIRCUIT
I
AM
TRYING
TO
BUILD
A
CIRCUIT
THAT
DETECTS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
VIDEO
VS
A
BLANK
SCREEN
BY
MONITORING
THE
RG
AND
B
OUTPUTS
OF
A
GRAPHICS
CARD
IT
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
DETECT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
SINGLE
PIXEL
AT
MHZ
WHICH
WOULD
MEAN
DETECTING
A
NS
PULSE
IT
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
BLANK
SCREEN
ABOUT
MV
AND
A
DIM
SCREEN
SAY
AROUND
MV
OH
YES
IT
ALSO
NEEDS
TO
BE
CHEAP
MY
FIRST
CIRCUIT
WAS
A
DISMAL
FAILURE
I
USED
COMPARIATORS
EACH
COMPARIATOR
HAD
THE
INPUT
GOING
TO
ONE
OF
THE
GUNS
THE
INPUT
WENT
TO
A
REFERENCE
CREATED
BY
A
VOLTAGE
DIVIDERA
POTENTIOMETER
THE
FIRST
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
THE
COMPARIATOR
WAS
WAY
TOO
SLOW
I
NEEDED
TO
GET
SEVERAL
PIXELS
IN
A
ROW
BEFORE
IT
WOULD
FIRE
THE
COMPARIATORS
SO
I
COULD
HAVE
A
WHOLE
SCREEN
FULL
OF
TEXT
BUT
MY
CIRCUIT
WOULD
NOT
DETECT
IT
THE
SECOND
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THERE
WAS
MORE
NOISE
ON
THE
REFERENCE
THEN
THE
SMALLEST
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
BLANK
SCREEN
AND
A
DIM
SCREEN
IN
FACT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
COMPLETELY
BLACK
AND
COMPLETELY
WHITE
IS
ONLY
MV
I
AM
WONDERING
IF
I
AM
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
AMPLIFY
THE
VIDEO
SIGNALS
TO
MAKE
THIS
WORK
THERE
ARE
FASTER
COMPARIATORS
BUT
THEY
ARE
EXPENSIVE
AND
REQUIRE
SPLIT
SUPPLIES
I
WOULD
NEED
TO
REPLACE
MY
QUAD
COMPARIATOR
WITH
THREE
COMPARIATORS
AND
CREATE
A
WHOLE
NEW
POWER
SUPPLY
CIRCUIT
AT
THIS
POINT
I
THINK
WHAT
I
NEED
IS
SOME
SORT
OF
TRANSISTOR
CIRCUIT
TRANSISTORS
ARE
FAST
AND
CHEAP
AND
SHOULD
DO
THE
TRICK
UNFORTUNATELY
I
AM
WAY
OUT
OF
MY
LEAGUE
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
DESIGNING
TRANSISTOR
CIRCUITS
SO
I
AM
APPEALING
TO
THE
NET
FOR
HELP
ANY
IDEAS
TIPS
CIRCUITS
POINTERS
REFERENCES
ETC
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
OH
YES
I
ONLY
SAMPLE
THE
OUTPUT
OF
THIS
THING
EVERY
SECOND
OR
SO
SO
I
DONT
NEED
A
FAST
RESPONSE
TIME
AT
ALL
HOWEVER
I
HAVENT
FOUND
A
WAY
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THAT
FACT
THANKS
A
LOT
FOR
ANY
HELP
ANYBODY
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
GIVE
OF
COURSE
YOU
WILL
HAVE
MY
UNDYING
GRATITUDE
