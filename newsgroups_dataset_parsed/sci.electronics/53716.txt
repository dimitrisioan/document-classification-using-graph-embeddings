WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
IF
YOU
WANT
THREEPRONG
OUTLETS
WITHOUT
ADDITIONAL
WIRING
IS
TO
USE
A
GFCI
OUTLET
OR
BREAKER
BUT
THE
OUTLET
WILL
BE
CHEAPER
IN
FACT
DEPENDING
ON
WHERE
YOU
ARE
PUTTING
YOUR
NEW
OUTLETS
A
GFCI
MAY
BE
REQUIRED
YOU
STILL
NEED
TO
SUPPLY
A
PROPER
GROUND
FOR
A
GROUND
FAULT
CIRCUIT
INTERRUPTER
NOT
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NEC
NOR
THE
CEC
AS
EXPLAINED
IN
THE
ELECTRICAL
WIRING
FAQ
WHICH
I
POSTED
HERE
SEPARATELY
NOTE
THE
MATERIAL
UNDER
THE
HEADINGS
SUBJECT
HOW
DO
I
CONVERT
TWO
PRONG
RECEPTACLES
TO
THREE
PRONG
AND
SUBJECT
ARE
YOU
SURE
ABOUT
GFCIS
AND
UNGROUNDED
OUTLETS
SHOULD
THE
TEST
BUTTON
WORK
OF
COURSE
AS
THEY
SAID
LOCAL
CODES
MAY
VARY
SO
REWIRING
IS
STILL
A
PART
OF
THIS
JOB
HOWEVER
THE
GROUND
MAY
BE
CONNECTED
TO
A
LOCAL
EARTH
GROUND
RATHER
THAN
BACK
AT
THE
BREAKER
BOX
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
IF
THE
GROUND
CONNECTIONS
ON
THE
OUTLETS
ARE
CONNECTED
TO
ANYTHING
THEY
SHOULD
BE
CONNECTED
TO
A
WIRE
THAT
RUNS
BACK
TO
THE
MAIN
PANEL
WHERE
IT
IS
BONDED
TO
THE
NEUTRAL
CONNECTOR
AND
TO
THE
HOUSE
GROUND
ROD
A
CONNECTION
TO
A
LOCAL
EARTH
GROUND
WOULD
NOT
NECESSARILY
MEET
ONE
OF
THE
GOALS
OF
THE
GROUND
WIRE
WHICH
IS
THAT
IF
A
SHORT
DEVELOPS
FROM
HOT
TO
THE
GROUND
WIRE
ENOUGH
CURRENT
WOULD
FLOW
TO
TRIP
THE
BREAKER
HMMM
HOW
ARE
THOSE
ORANGE
ISOLATED
GROUND
OUTLETS
OFTEN
USED
IN
COMPUTER
