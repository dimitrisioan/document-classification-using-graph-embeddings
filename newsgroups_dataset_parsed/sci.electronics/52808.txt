DU
WRITES
I
HAVE
A
PROJECT
THAT
WAS
DROOPED
IN
MY
LAP
THAT
IS
SOMEWHAT
A
PAIN
TO
DESIGN
WHAT
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
IS
A
STABLE
ULTRALONG
SOLID
STATE
TIMER
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
DO
IS
TO
PLACE
THIS
THING
ON
THE
ANTARTIC
ICE
SHELF
AND
MEASURE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
SNOW
FALL
OVER
A
PERIOD
OF
SIX
WEEKS
EVERY
TWO
WEEKS
THEY
WANT
TO
TRIP
A
SELONOID
TO
DISCHARGE
DIFFERENT
COLORED
PELLETS
BY
GAS
PRESSURE
OUT
ACROSS
THE
SNOW
THEN
BY
DIGGING
DOWN
INTO
THE
SNOW
THE
SNOW
FALL
AMOUNT
CAN
BE
MEASURED
AS
THEY
COME
TO
THE
DIFFERENT
COLOR
PELLETS
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TRYING
TO
BUILD
A
TIMER
THAT
WOULD
STAND
THE
COLD
DEGREES
AND
A
POWER
SOURCE
THAT
WOULDNT
DRAIN
I
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
THE
TIMERS
AND
THE
STANDARD
DUAL
TIMERS
BUT
THIER
TEMP
SPECS
WONT
GO
THAT
LOW
ALSO
TWO
WEEKS
EQUATES
TO
SECONDS
PER
FIRING
WHICH
MEANS
ONE
BIG
TIMING
CAP
I
HAVE
FOUND
FARAD
YES
FARAD
CAPS
THAT
HAVE
A
WORKING
VOLTAGE
OF
VOLTS
AND
ARE
SMALL
IN
SIZE
BUT
AGAIN
THE
TIME
OF
DISCHARGE
AT
OR
LOWER
DEGREES
ISNT
LINEAR
I
WAS
THINKING
OF
USING
SEVERAL
TIMERS
CHAINED
TOGETHER
TO
FIRE
THE
SELONID
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TIMING
PERIOD
BUT
THAT
BLASTED
COLD
AND
THE
DRAIN
ON
A
BATTERY
OVER
SIX
WEEKS
IS
THE
PAIN
ONE
POSSIBILITY
WOULD
BE
TO
USE
SOLAR
PANELS
BUT
THIS
IS
DURING
THE
SIX
MONTH
TWILIGHT
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
GOOD
IDEAS
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
WES
JUST
A
SUGGESTION
TAKE
A
MOTOROLA
SET
IT
UP
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
PULSE
ONCE
EVERY
SEC
OR
TEN
SECS
WITH
EITHER
A
RC
OR
XTAL
CLOCK
INPUT
THEN
FEED
TO
A
AS
CLOCK
INPUT
AND
DECODE
OUTPUT
FOR
SEC
OUTPUT
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
ADD
A
FEW
AND
GATES
OR
DECODER
CHIPS
TO
GET
OUTPUT
AND
RESET
PULSE
BACK
TO
TO
RESTART
CYCLE
TRIGGER
A
ONESHOT
FROM
THE
DECODED
RISEING
EDGE
THE
ONE
SHOT
THEN
GOES
TO
A
MOSFET
TO
DRIVE
THE
MECHANISM
TO
FIRE
THE
PELLET
LAUNCHER
THESE
CKTS
REQUIRE
UAMPS
OF
CURRENTBETWEEN
VOLTS
SO
A
VOLT
GEL
CELL
OF
A
FEW
AMPHOURS
WOULD
LAST
THE
SIX
WEEKS
THEN
TAKE
THE
CKT
BOARD
BATTERY
WRAP
IN
OR
OF
FOAM
OR
BUILD
A
BOX
OF
OUT
OF
THE
STUFFWITH
PLYWOOD
OR
METAL
EXTERIOR
BUILD
A
SMALL
HEATER
OUT
OF
WATT
RESISTORS
IN
SERIES
TO
KEEP
THE
BATTERY
AND
CKTS
WARM
THOUGHT
USE
BATTERIES
ONE
FOR
HEATER
ONE
FOR
TIMER
AND
PELLET
TRIGGER
INSOLATEINSOLATEEVEN
THOUGH
THE
CHIPS
STATE
THAT
THE
AL
RATED
DEVICES
ARE
GOOD
TO
C
THE
BATTERIES
HAVE
A
CONSIDERABLE
REDUCTION
IN
CAPACITYOH
MAKE
SURE
THE
AREA
INSIDE
HAS
MINIUM
AIR
LEAKAGE
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
RW
IS
THIS
TO
LONG
WINDED
FOR
THE
NETBE
