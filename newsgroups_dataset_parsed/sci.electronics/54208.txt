RE
PINK
NOISE
IN
ARTICLE
DAVID
SHARPE
WRITES
PINK
NOISE
AND
WHITE
NOISE
ARE
EQUAL
AMOUNTS
OF
ALL
FREQUENCIES
THIS
IS
IN
MOST
CASES
AROUND
THE
HZ
RANGE
PINKWHITE
ARE
USED
TO
ADJUST
FOR
ROOM
DYNAMICS
AND
STUFF
LIKE
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
EQS
OUT
ON
THE
MARKET
THAT
HAVE
PINK
NOISE
BUILT
IN
MOST
ALL
FROM
AUDIO
CONTROL
HAVE
THEM
I
KNOW
THE
DOES
WITH
REGARDS
TO
WHAT
YOU
WROTE
HOW
DOES
ONE
ADJUST
FOR
ROOM
DYNAMICS
AND
STUFF
LIKE
THAT
I
ASKED
A
PROFESSOR
THAT
QUESTION
JUST
LAST
WEEK
AND
HE
DIDNT
REALLY
KNOW
HIMSELF
SINCE
PINK
NOISE
IS
BELIEVED
TO
BE
DUE
TO
SURFACE
STATES
SAY
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
SILICON
WHERE
THERES
A
LACK
OF
A
COVALENT
BOND
THAT
ACT
AS
TRAPS
TO
NEARBY
ELECRONS
AND
SINCE
THIS
HAPPENS
AT
LOW
FREQUENCIES
BECAUSE
AT
HIGH
FREQUENCIES
THEY
ARENT
ABLE
TO
TRAP
ELECTRONS
HOW
DO
YOU
COMPENSATE
FOR
THAT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
WOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
COMPENSATE
FOR
PINK
NOISE
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
PINK
NOISE
FEATURE
HOWEVER
ON
MANY
EQS
AND
I
WAS
WONDERING
HOW
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSE
TO
COMPENSATE
FOR
NOISE
WHEN
PINK
NOISE
IS
NOT
DUE
TO
MAN
MADE
NOISE
LIKE
POWER
LINES
CROSSTALKS
COUPLING
ETC
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THIS
IT
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
HOPE
THIS
DIDNT
SOUND
TOO
DRAWN
OUT
THANX
