I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
A
TEXTREFERENCE
THAT
WILL
INCLUDE
PINOUTS
DESCRIPTION
AND
FUNCTIONALITY
FOR
JUST
ABOUT
ANY
IC
MADE
DOES
SUCH
A
TEXT
EXIST
ARE
THERE
DOCS
ON
THE
INTERNET
THAT
REFERENCE
ICS
IT
WOULD
BE
A
GREAT
IDEA
IF
EACH
MAJOR
IC
MANUFACTURER
MADE
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
PUBLIC
AN
ANONYMOUS
FTP
SITE
WITH
ALL
ITS
DATA
BOOKS
IN
THE
FORM
OF
TEXT
FILES
ALA
RFC
STYLE
THIS
WOULD
SAVE
TIME
AND
MONEY
FOR
THE
IC
MANUFACTURER
SINCE
A
TEXT
FILE
COSTS
NOTHING
TO
SEND
AROUND
THE
WORLD
VIA
INTERNET
AND
SINCE
MOST
USERS
OF
ICS
ARE
FOUND
IN
THE
INTERNET
ANYWAY
ARE
THERE
ANY
BOOKS
AVAILABLE
FOR
PURCHASE
THAT
REFERENCE
AS
MANY
AS
POSSIBLE
OR
AM
I
GOING
TO
BE
STUCK
OBTAINING
A
ZILLION
DATABOOKS
FROM
THE
MANUFACTURERS
THOSE
LITTLE
PHONEBOOKTYPE
BOOKS
THAT
ARE
OBSOLETED
EVERY
COUPLE
YEARS
WE
USE
A
CDROM
BASED
SYSTEM
HERE
THERE
ARE
ABOUT
CDROM
DISKS
AND
A
CHANGER
HOOKED
TO
A
DEDICATED
MSDOS
COMPUTER
IT
CONTAINS
SCANNED
IMAGES
OF
DATA
BOOK
PAGES
FOR
SEVERAL
THOUSAND
PARTS
WHEN
YOU
ASK
IT
FOR
SOMETHING
IT
KNOWS
ABOUT
MOSTLY
ACTIVE
IC
PARTS
IT
WORKS
QUITE
WELL
THEY
DONT
HANDLE
ALL
THE
VARIETIES
OF
TRANSISTORS
OR
DIODES
THAT
EXIST
IT
IS
DEFINATELY
A
START
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
BUT
THEY
NEED
TO
EXPAND
THE
DATA
BASE
TO
HANDLE
MORE
TYPES
OF
STUFF
THESE
SYSTEMS
ARENT
CHEAP
WE
PAID
ABOUT
FOR
THE
LISCENCE
AND
GET
MONTHLY
UPDATES
OF
SOME
OF
THE
CDROM
DISKS
WE
SEND
THE
OLD
ONES
BACK
TO
THEM
SO
THAT
THEY
WILL
KEEP
SENDING
US
THE
UPDATES
I
THINK
WE
PAY
A
YEARLY
MAINTAINENCE
FEE
OF
ABOUT
TO
GET
THE
UPDATES
IF
YOU
FIND
THE
PART
YOU
WANT
YOU
CAN
LOOK
AT
THE
DATA
SHEET
ON
A
PAGESIZED
MONITOR
ITS
A
SPECIAL
MONITOR
FROM
SIGMASYSTEMS
YOU
CAN
ALSO
PRINT
EACH
PAGE
OF
THE
DATASHEET
YOU
WANT
ON
A
LASERJET
PRINTER
PAGE
PRINTING
TAKES
A
COUPLE
OF
MINUTES
PER
PAGE
IT
CAN
TAKE
A
WHILE
TO
DUMP
THE
OR
PAGES
YOU
USUALLY
NEED
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THE
MAKER
WOULDNT
LIKE
IT
IF
WE
MADE
THE
DATA
AVAILABLE
TO
ALL
INTERNET
USERS
