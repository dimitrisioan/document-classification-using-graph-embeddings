ACID
BATTERIES

CARTER

WRITES
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
ONE
THING
ACTUALLY
TWO
I
HOPE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
PROPER
PLACE
TO
POST
THIS
SUBJECT
WHY
DOES
A
LEAD
ACID
BATTERY
DISCHARGE
AND
BECOME
DEAD
TOTALLY
UNUSEABLE
WHEN
STORED
ON
A
CONCRETE
FLOOR
I
DECIDED
TO
BRING
THE
BATTERY
IN
FROM
THE
LAWN
MOWER
AND
THE
MOTORCYCLE
FROM
THE
UNHEATED
GARAGE
THIS
YEAR
TO
PRESERVE
THEM
AND
I
JUST
WENT
TO
USE
THEM
AND
NOTICED
THAT
NOT
ONLY
DO
THEY
NOT
WORK
BUT
THEY
ACT
LIKE
THE
TWO
TERMINALS
ARE
SHORTED
I
ASKED
A
FRIEND
AND
HE
SAID
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
NEVER
DO
THAT
CAUSE
IT
RUINS
THEM
BUT
HE
COULDNT
TELL
ME
WHY
I
DONT
SEE
ANY
WAY
THAT
THE
CONCRETE
FLOOR
COULD
DO
ANYTHING
TO
THE
BATTERY
HOWEVER
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BETTER
OFF
LEAVING
THEM
OUTSIDE
KEEPING
THEM
COLD
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BETTER
FOR
THEM
THAN
BRINGING
THEM
INSIDE
A
WARM
BATTERY
WILL
SELFDISCHARGE
FASTER
THAN
A
COLD
ONE
WHEN
YOU
ARE
STORING
A
BATTERY
ITS
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
CHARGE
IT
ONCE
A
MONTH
LETTING
A
BATTERY
GO
COMPLETELY
DEAD
IS
BAD
FOR
IT
I
SUSPECT
THIS
IS
WHAT
CAUSED
YOUR
PROBLEMS
