why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
i
think
its
because
the
lead
gets
coated
with
lead
oxide
if
the
battery
is
not
being
charged
or
discharged
i
remember
some
advice
from
an
ancient
car
manual
guide
my
father
had
which
was
to
use
car
batteries
to
power
a
garage
clock
or
something
similar
when
theyre
not
in
a
car
this
is
supposed
to
prevent
the
oxidation
but
ive
no
idea
if
it
really
works
the
concrete
floor
connection
is
a
red
herring
it
could
be
that
you
stored
it
somewhere
that
it
could
become
covered
by
moisture
or
damp
air
which
would
short
out
the
terminals
this
may
contribute
to
discharging
but
would
be
reversible
the
same
thing
happens
to
my
car
citroen
damp
gets
under
the
bonnet
us
hood
and
shorts
the
sparkplugs
to
earth
so
it
wont
start
the
solution
for
the
car
is
to
clean
the
plug
leads
and
spray
with
moisture
repellant
if
damp
is
the
problem
then
storing
the
well
this
is
offtopic
but
back
in
the
days
when
i
used
to
drive
bangers
i
never
found
to
do
anything
that
wiping
with
a
dry
cloth
didnt
do
i
think
the
effectiveness
of
is
a
myth
invented
by
the
guy
who
owns
the
company
battery
off
the
ground
may
help
im
not
sure
if
spraying
with
would
be
safe
since
it
is
very
flammable
high
percentage
petroleum
just
a
thought
