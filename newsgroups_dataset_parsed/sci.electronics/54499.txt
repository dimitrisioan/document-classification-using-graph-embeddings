SUMMARY
HOW
ABOUT
STARTING
A
GROUP
WHERE
SCIENTIFIC
ARTICLES
CAN
BE
PREPUBLISH
KEYWORDS
SCIENTIFIC
PAPERS
ELECTRONIC
MAGAZINE
FOR
SOME
TIME
IVE
BEEN
THINKING
ABOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
STARTING
A
GROUP
WHERE
SCIENTIFIC
ARTICLES
CAN
BE
PUBLISHED
OR
PERHAPS
JUST
SUMMARIES
POSSIBLE
ADVANTAGES
WOULD
BE
FREE
DISTRIBUTION
FAST
ACCEPTANCE
ONLINE
DISCUSSION
BETWEEN
AUTHORS
AND
READERS
THIS
WOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
WITH
ONE
GROUP
WITH
A
MODERATOR
FOR
PUBLISHING
THE
ARTICLES
AND
ONE
PERHAPS
WITHOUT
FOR
DISCUSSION
I
THINK
ITS
A
GREAT
BUT
IDEALISTIC
IDEA
A
RESEACHER
WILL
FIRST
OF
ALL
TRY
TO
PUBLISH
A
WORTHY
PAPER
IN
A
CREDIBLE
PROFESSIONAL
MAGAZINE
AND
NOT
IN
A
COMMUNITY
LIKE
USENET
WHICH
IS
INFAMOUS
FOR
LOTS
NOT
ALL
OF
JUNK
INFORMATION
THE
PAPERS
THAT
WILL
BE
PUBLISHED
HERE
WILL
IN
GENERAL
BE
OF
LOW
QUALITY
ALSO
IT
IS
IMPROBABLE
THAT
ANY
CREDIT
WILL
BE
GIVEN
TO
A
RESEARCHER
WHO
PUBLISH
HERE
AND
SADLY
THAT
IS
NOWADAYS
A
MAIN
REASON
FOR
PUBLISHING
USENET
IS
GREAT
FOR
INFORMAL
DISCUSSIONS
AND
FREE
EXCHANGE
OF
IDEAS
KEEP
IT
LIKE
THAT
A
NEW
SPECIALIST
GROUP
IS
JUST
NOT
WORTH
IT
