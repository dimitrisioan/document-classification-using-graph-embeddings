WRITES
RUBBISH
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
COLOUR
OF
THE
BOARDS
DEPENDS
ON
THE
SOLDER
THE
MAY
COVER
OF
QST
HAS
A
PICTURE
OF
THREE
DIFFERENT
BOARDS
WITHOUT
ANY
SOLDER
MASK
YOU
CAN
TELL
FROM

THE

THE

EXPOSED
ON

IS
SOME
FIBERGLASS
BOARD
THAT
LOOKS
GREEN
TO
ME
I
SEE
NO
REASON
FOR
PUTTING
SOLDER
MASK
ON
CIRCUIT
BOARD
USED

I
WONDER
IF
ANY
MANUFACTURER
ACTUALLY
PUTS
A
