re
why
circuit
boards
are
green
in

writes
rubbish
the
reason
for
the
colour
of
the
boards
depends
on
the
solder
the
may
cover
of
qst
has
a
picture
of
three
different
boards
without
any
solder
mask
you
can
tell
from
the
copper
colored
traces
the
box
labeled
transverter
has
the
brown
teflonglass
board
while
the
one
in
the
center
has
the
grayish
board
exposed
on
the
left
is
some
fiberglass
board
that
looks
green
to
me
i
see
no
reason
for
putting
solder
mask
on
circuit
board
used
for
box
covers
i
wonder
if
any
manufacturer
actually
puts
a
solder
mask
on
their
low
noise
microwave
preamps
often
microwave
circuits
have
odd
bits
of
wirefoilmetal
attached
to
whereverwhatever
is
necessary
to
make
the
unit
work
properly
this
is
a
commercial
product
a
solder
mask
would
certainly
make
doing
this
tougher
never
mind
the
finding
something
that
minimally
degrades
the
circuits
q
dope
for
coils
does
not
improve
the
qit
just
holds
things
together
with
minimal
loss

if
you
really
have
to
mask
that
is
used
older
boards
bakelite
and
phenolic
rarely
used
a
solder
mask
these
boards
are
not
suited
well
to
automatic
stuffing
and
soldering
techniques
and
hence
are
the
colour
of
the
compound
used
to
make
them
these
days
boards
are
made
of
fibreglass
for
most
general
purpose
uses
and
have
a
solder
mask
applied
to
them
to
prevent
close
traces
shorting
to
one
another
during
soldering
and
also
to
prevent
the
decomposition
of
traces
under
harsh
environments
the
light
and
dark
green
boards
ofter
seen
have
a
dry
film
mask
applied
to
them
usually
applied
as
a
complete
film
photographically
produced
the
blue
and
red
or
orange
boards
are
a
twopart
epoxy
or
a
liquidimageable
resist
formulation
and
are
applied
in
a
different
manner
theres
a
lot
of
info
about
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
but
thats
another
story
