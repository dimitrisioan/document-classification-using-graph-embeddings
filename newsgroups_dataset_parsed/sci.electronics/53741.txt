HOW
DOES
DIFFERENTIAL

GPS
WORK
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
NEW
GPS
BOXES
NOW
HAVE
AN
OPTION
KNOWN
AS

A
ROUGH
SKETCH
OF
HOW
THE
SYSTEM
WORKS
A
REFERENCE
STATION
WITH
A
VERY
EXACTLY
KNOWN
POSITION
COMPUTES
THE
ERRORS
IN
THE
INCOMING
GPS
SIGNALS
THESE
ERRORS
ARE
DUE
TO
SEVERAL
FACTORS
INCLUDING
ATMOSPHERIC
DISTORTION
SA
SELECTIVE
AVAILABILITY
TIME
DITHERING
ETC
THE
REFERENCE
UNIT
CONTAINS
COMPLEX
COMPUTATIONAL
EQUIPMENT
TO
BACK
OUT
THE
ERRORS
IN
ITS
POSITION
SINCE
IT
KNOWS
WHERE
IT
IS
ALREADY
IT
THEN
TRANSMITS
THESE
CORRECTIONS
ON
A
BROADCAST
WHICH
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
ANY
NUMBER
OF
RELATIVELY
LOCAL
RECEIVERS
IF
THE
RECEIVERS
ARE
NEARBY
AND
ARE
USING
THE
SAME
SATELLITES
AS
THE
REFERENCE
UNIT
THE
ERRORS
SHOULD
BE
VERY
SIMILAR
FOR
THE
REFERENCE
UNIT
AND
THE
RECEIVER
UNIT
THUS
THE
RECEIVER
UNIT
MAY
APPLY
THE
CORRECTIONS
CALCULATED
BY
THE

COAST
GUARD
IS
CURRENTLY
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
INSTALLING
A
SERIES
OF
COASTLINE
TRANSMITTERS
FOR
DIFFERENTIAL
GPS
THESE
STATIONS
WILL
USE
EXISTING
RADIO
TOWERS
I
BELIEVE
THE
FREQUENCY
IS
TO
BE
APPROXIMATELY
KHZ
THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHER

OFFERING

PINPOINT

AND

AN

WHICH
HAS

ALL
ACROSS

THE
