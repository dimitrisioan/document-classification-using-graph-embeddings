THE
XNF
FORMAT
IS
PROPIERTY
AND
I
KNOW
OF
AT
LEAST
ON
PERSON
AT
A
UNIVERSITY
WHO
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
IT
AFTER
SIGNING
A
NONDISCLOSURE
AGREEMENT
THE
XILINXBIT
MAP
FORMAT
IS
PRETTY
WELL
TOP
SECRET
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
KNOW
IT
BECAUSE
THEN
YOU
COULD
MAKE
SELFMODIFYINGHARDWARE
AS
IT
IS
I
HAD
TO
REVERSE
ENG
THE
XILINX
TOOLS
TO
DUMP
THE
BIT
MAP
TO
THE
FPGA
BECAUSE
IT
ONLY
RUNS
ON
THE
COMPUTER
WITH
THE
HARDWARE
KEY
SELFMODIFYING
HARDWARE
COULD
BE
VERY
INTERESTING
COMPUTERS
THAT
COULD
WRITE
THIER
OWN
PROGRAMS
ASSEMBLERS
COMPILERS
WERE
AN
IMMENSE
BREAKTHROUGH
FROM
CALCULATORS
THAT
COULDNT
I
EAGERLY
AWAIT
A
PROGRAMMABLE
GATE
ARRAY
WHICH
USES
A
PD
FORMAT
AND
DOES
NOT
COST
YOUR
FIRST
BORN
TO
PROGRAM
TILL
THEN
WE
WILL
KEEP
ON
REVERSE
ENGINEERING
WHATEVER
WE
CAN
AS
IT
IS
ONE
COMPANY
THAT
I
WORKED
AT
HAS
GONE
UNDER
FPGAS
ARE
WHAT
THEY
NEEDED
TO
MAKE
THEIR
PRODUCT
COMPETITIVE
THEY
COULD
NOT
AFFORD
THEM
IN
THE
END
YOU
COULD
SAY
THAT
THEY
COULD
NOT
AFFORD
TO
NOT
USE
THEM
BUT
THE
MANAGEMENT
DISCOVERED
THAT
TOO
LATE
ERIC
MY
CONDOLENCES
I
CANT
EVEN
IMAGINE
WHAT
I
COULD
DO
WITH
SELFMODIFING
HARDWARE
I
CAN
IMAGINE
SELFMODIFYING
SOFTWARE
AND
EVEN
THOUGH
ALL
MY
TEACHERS
SAY
THATS
BAD
EVEN
WORSE
THAN
GOTO
CHECK
OUT
WHAT
THE
EXPERTS
USED
TO
SAY
ABOUT
SELFMODIFYING
CODE
HE
USES
ORDERS
RATHER
THAN
OPCODES

BUT
WE
WILL
USE
THE
FIRST
BINARY
DIGIT
TO
DENOTE
THE

OR
TWO
BINARY

ORDERS
IT
SHOULD
BE
ADDED
THAT
THIS
TECHNIQUE
OF
AUTOMATIC
SUBSTITUTIONS
INTO
ORDERS
IE
THE
MACHINES
ABILITY
TO
MODIFY
ITS
OWN
ORDERS
UNDER
THE
CONTROL
OF
OTHER
ONES
AMONG
ITS
ORDERS
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NECESSARY
FOR
A
FLEXIBLE
CODE
THUS
IF
PART
OF
THE

IS
USED
AS
A
FUNCTION
TABLE
THEN
LOOKING
UP
A
VALUE
OF
THAT
FUNCTION
FOR
A
VALUE
OF
THE
VARIABLE
WHICH
IS
OBTAINED
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
COMPUTATION
REQUIRES
THAT
THE
MACHINE
ITSELF
SHOULD
MODIFY
OR
RATHER
MAKE
UP
THE
REFERENCE
TO
THE
MEMORY
IN
THE
ORDER
WHICH
CONTROLS
THIS
LOOKING
UP
AND
THE
MACHINE
CAN
ONLY
MAKE
THIS
MODIFICATION
AFTER
IT
HAS
ALREADY
CALCULATED
THE
VALUE
OF
THE
VARIABLE
IN
QUESTION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THIS
ABILITY
OF
THE
MACHINE
TO
MODIFY
ITS
OWN
ORDERS
IS
ONE
OF
THE

WHICH
MAKES

NONTRIVIAL
