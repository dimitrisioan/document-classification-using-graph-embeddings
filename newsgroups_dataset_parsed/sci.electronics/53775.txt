my
yr
old
son
has
signed
up
to
do
a
science
report
on
batteries
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
provide
me
with
some
information
as
to
how
to
construct
a
homebuilt
battery
in
my
grade
school
days
i
remember
snip
i
havent
been
following
this
so
im
sorry
if
somebody
already
mentioned
this
but
you
could
grab
a
lemon
i
think
potatoes
work
too
but
im
not
sure
a
strip
of
copper
and
a
strip
of
zinc
i
think
you
can
get
the
metal
in
a
hardware
store
or
hobby
shop
maybe
stick
the
strips
in
the
lemon
so
they
dont
touch
and
youll
get
a
measurable
voltage
not
a
lot
but
hey
its
a
lemon
as
i
recall
we
had
to
hook
something
like
ten
of
these
things
to
get
an
appreciable
amount
of
current
because
of
the
mondo
internal
resistance
but
if
you
just
need
a
demo
you
might
get
it
to
run
a
tiny
fan
or
something
