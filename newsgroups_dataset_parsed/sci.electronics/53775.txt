MY
YR
OLD
SON
HAS
SIGNED
UP
TO
DO
A
SCIENCE
REPORT
ON
BATTERIES
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
COULD
PROVIDE
ME
WITH
SOME
INFORMATION
AS
TO
HOW
TO
CONSTRUCT
A
HOMEBUILT
BATTERY
IN
MY
GRADE
SCHOOL
DAYS
I
REMEMBER
SNIP
I
HAVENT
BEEN
FOLLOWING
THIS
SO
IM
SORRY
IF
SOMEBODY
ALREADY
MENTIONED
THIS
BUT
YOU
COULD
GRAB
A
LEMON
I
THINK
POTATOES
WORK
TOO
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
A
STRIP
OF
COPPER
AND
A
STRIP
OF
ZINC
I
THINK
YOU
CAN
GET
THE
METAL
IN
A
HARDWARE
STORE
OR
HOBBY
SHOP
MAYBE
STICK
THE
STRIPS
IN
THE
LEMON
SO
THEY
DONT
TOUCH
AND
YOULL
GET
A
MEASURABLE
VOLTAGE
NOT
A
LOT
BUT
HEY
ITS
A
LEMON
AS
I
RECALL
WE
HAD
TO
HOOK
SOMETHING
LIKE
TEN
OF
THESE
THINGS
TO
GET
AN
APPRECIABLE
AMOUNT
OF
CURRENT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
MONDO
INTERNAL
RESISTANCE
BUT
IF
YOU
JUST
NEED
A
DEMO
YOU
MIGHT
GET
IT
TO
RUN
A
TINY
FAN
OR
SOMETHING
