so
when
you
turn
on
the
power
this
causes
the
bulb
to
work
like
a
neon
heating
up
and
shorting
out
thus
providing
a
loop
to
power
the
heaters
in
the
main
tube
when
the
tube
fires
insufficient
current
runs
through
the
starter
to
keep
the
heat
up
and
the
bimetalic
strip
straightens
out
oc
imprecise
this
description
ignores
the
role
of
the
ballast
misrepresents
the
heating
effects
in
the
starter
the
bimetalic
strip
cools
down
immediately
after
the
contacts
short
circuit
because
the
neon
discharge
stops
and
much
less
heat
is
generated
from
the
loss
in
the
metal
as
compared
to
the
neon
discharge
the
starter
contacts
open
before
the
tube
fires
actually
the
tube
fires
as
a
result
of
the
backemf
generated
in
the
ballast
because
of
this
immediate
opening
of
the
starters
contacts
a
capacitor
is
connected
in
parallel
with
the
contacts
to
prevent
excessive
arcing
during
the
firing
the
neon
reionizes
but
does
not
draw
sufficient
current
to
prevent
firing
of
the
tube
itself
