THE
BATTERY
GOES
DEAD
PRIMARILY
BECAUST
THE
FLOOR
IS
COLD
THE
TEMPERATURE
COMBINED
WITH
SELFDISCHARGE
PROMOTES
SULFATION
WHICH
RUINS
THE
PLATES
OF
THE
BATTERY
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
ONLY
REASON
THE
BATTERY
DOESNT
GO
DEAD
AS
QUICKLY
ON
A
DIRT
SURFACE
IS
BECAUSE
CEMENT
TENDS
TO
BE
QUITE
COOLER
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
HOW
CEMENT
IS
ABLE
TO
MAINTAIN
A
LOWER
AVERAGE
TEMPERATURE
THAN
DIRT
SHEESH
ITS
NOT
THE
TEMPERATURE
ITS
THE
KARMA
YOU
SEE
DIRT
HAS
GOOD
KARMA
SINCE
ITS
ALL
ORGANIC
AND
FULL
OF
LIVING
THINGS
BUT
CEMENT
IS
ALL
SQUARED
OFF
AND
ARTIFICIAL
LOOKING
AND
HAS
LOST
ITS
KARMA
IN
THE
PROCESS
BEING
A
KARMA
SINK
IT
SUCKS
ALL
OF
THE
GOOD
KARMA
OUT
OF
THE
BATTERY
WHICH
IS
NO
LONGER
ABLE
TO
KEEP
A
CHARGE
BECAUSE
WOOD
IS
ALSO
GOOD
AND
ORGANIC
PUTTING
A
BOARD
BETWEEN
THE
BATTERY
AND
THE
CEMENT
WILL
FIX
THE
PROBLEMS
THE
BUDDHANATURE
IS
IN
THE
ACID
BUT
IT
IS
ALSO
IN
THE
LEAD
PLATE
THE
NOVICE
ASKED
THE
MASTER
WHETHER
THE
SPONGY
LEAD
HAD
MORE
OF
THE
KARMA
OR
WHETHER
THE
SOLID
LEAD
HAD
IT
THE
MASTER
HANDED
THE
NOVICE
A
B
BATTERY
TERMINALS
DOWNWARD
AND
THUS
THE
NOVICE
WAS
ENLIGHTENED
