I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
NEW
PORTABLE
CD
PLAYER
FOR
THE
OFFICE
AND
I
NOTICE
THAT
IT
PROUDLY
PROCLAIMS
TIMES
OVERSAMPLING
ON
THE
BOX
NOW
WHILE
I
THINK
I
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
OVERSAMPLING
IS
THE
RATE
OF
DISCRETE
SAMPLES
EXCEEDS
THE
HIGHEST
FREQUENCY
COMPONENT
OF
INTEREST
BY
SOME
FACTOR
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THIS
TIMES
BUSINESS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
MY
FIRST
CD
PLAYER
WAS
IT
REALLY
YEARS
AGO
THE
SPECS
SAID
TIMES
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHETHER
IM
GETTING
SENILE
IF
IM
NOT
THEN
WHAT
GOOD
DOES
IT
DO
FOR
THE
PLAYER
TO
TAKE
SAMPLES
AT
A
HIGHER
RATE
THE
DATA
IS
ONLY
EVER
READ
ONCE
BARRING
MISTRACKS
AND
SUCH
OF
COURSE
AND
EVENTUALLY
GETS
TURNED
INTO
KHZ
BIT
TWO
CHANNEL
DATA
OVERSAMPLING
TAKES
TWO
DISCRETE
DATA
POINTS
AND
INTERPOLATES
POINTS
BETWEEN
THEM
FOR
N
TIMES
OVERSAMPLING
WHEN
I
ASKED
PEOPLE
SAID
THAT
THE
INTERPOLATION
WAS
NOT
SIMPLY
LINEAR
INTERPOLATION
BUT
SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE
COMPLICATED
YOU
ARE
QUITE
CORRECT
IN
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
THE
FILTERING
IS
NOT
INTERPOLATION
AS
THAT
WOULD
DISTORT
THE
FREQUENCY
CONTENT
OF
THE
SIGNAL
YOU
ARE
LISTENING
TO
GENERALLY
THESE
PLAYERS
RUN
THE
SAMPLES
THRU
AN
ALLPASS
FILTER
NETWORK
I
HAVE
DONE
THIS
FOR
ECG
WAVEFORMS
FROM
A
PERSONS
HEART
AND
THE
EFFECT
IS
RATHER
SPOOKY
IT
ACTUALLY
RECONSTRUCTS
PEAKS
THAT
WERENT
THERE
CORRECTLY
TOO
AND
FILLS
IN
THE
GAPS
WITH
THE
PROPERLY
COMPUTED
VALUES
JUST
AS
IF
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
REAL
SAMPLE
TAKEN
AT
THAT
POINT
I
USE
A
CPU
TO
DO
ALL
THE
MATH
IT
TAKES
A
DECENT
BUT
NOT
UNREASONABLE
AMOUNT
OF
CPU
TIME
TO
DO
THIS
YOU
CAN
KEEP
UP
WITH
THINGS
IN
REALTIME
IF
YOU
WRITE
EFFICIENT
CODE
IN
CASE
YOU
CARE
THE
FILTERING
METHOD
USES
AN
FIR
FINITE
IMPULSE
RESPONSE
FILTER
ID
GUESS
THAT
CD
MAKERS
USE
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
METHOD
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
KNOW
THE
REAL
ANSWER
ID
SAY
THAT
THEY
USE
A
TAPPED
DELAY
LINE
WITH
RESISTOROPAMP
WEIGHTING
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THE
FILTERING
THIS
STRIKES
ME
AS
THE
MOST
COST
EFFECTIVE
METHOD
FOR
VOLUME
PRODUCTION
RUNS
ANYWAY
THEN
THE
PURPOSE
OF
OVERSAMPLING
IS
TO
MOVE
THE
EFFECTIVE
SAMPLING
RATE
UP
TO
N
TIMES
KHZ
IN
ORDER
TO
USE
HIGHER
FREQUENCY
ANTIALIASING
FILTERS
FOR
THE
SAME
QUALITY
FILTER
HIGHER
OVERSAMPLING
LETS
YOU
BUILD
CHEAPER
FILTERS
WHEREAS
FOR
THE
SAME
PRICE
FILTER
HIGHER
OVERSAMPLINGS
LETS
YOU
BUILD
BETTER
FILTERS
SO
ASSUMING
THE
QUALITY
OF
ALL
OTHER
COMPONENTS
IN
A
CD
PLAYER
REMAINED
THE
SAME
OVERSAMPLING
SHOULD
ALLOW
A
MANUFACTURER
TO
PRODUCE
SLIGHTLY
BETTER
SOUND
DUE
TO
ANTIALIAS
FILTERING
ACTUALLY
I
THINK
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEY
DO
THIS
IS
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
SAY
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
MARKETTING
GIMIC
I
WOULD
GUESS
THAT
IT
IS
ACUTALLY
CHEAPER
TO
FILTER
AN
OVERSAMPLED
SIGNAL
THAN
NOT
YOU
CAN
USE
SLOPPIER
COMPONENTS
AND
GIVE
THE
FILTER
A
ROLLOFF
THAT
ISNT
SO
SHARP
ITS
TOO
BAD
THAT
THEY
CHARGE
MORE
FOR
SOMETHING
THAT
I
THINK
IS
ACTUALLY
LESS
COSTLY
TO
BUILD
I
SERIOUSLY
DOUBT
THAT
THE
FILTERS
COST
THE
SAME
BUT
ARE
BETTER
THEY
ARE
BUILT
TO
A
PRICE
SPEC
AND
THAT
SPEC
SAYS
CHEAP
AS
POSSIBLE
