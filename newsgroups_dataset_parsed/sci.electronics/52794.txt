RADAR
DETECTOR
DETECTORS
HERES
ONE
I
HOPE
SOME
KNOWLEDGEABLE
READERS
WILL
MAKE
A
COMMENT
OR
CONTRIBUTION
TO
IN
THE
STATE
OF
VIRGINIA
RADAR
DETECTORS
ARE
ILLEGAL
PERIOD
IF
YOU
ARE
CAUGHT
WITH
ONE
IT
WILL
BE
CONFISCATED
ON
THE
SPOT
AND
WILL
NOT
BE
RETURNED
UNTIL
AFTER
YOU
APPEAR
IN
COURT
AND
PAY
YOUR
FINE
THE
FINE
FOR
HAVING
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
ACCESSIBLE
IN
A
MOTOR
VEHICLE
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
NOT
ON
IS
SORRY
TOURIST
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
LAW
IS
NO
EXCUSE
THEY
WILL
GET
YOU
TOO
IT
USED
TO
BE
THAT
THE
ONLY
WAY
THE
LAW
COULD
BE
ENFORCED
WAS
FOR
AN
OFFICER
TO
ACTUALLY
SEE
THE
RADAR
DETECTOR
NOT
ANY
MORE
MANY
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
ARE
NOW
USING
RADAR
DETECTOR
DETECTORS
RIGHT
A
SUPER
SENSITIVE
RECEIVER
THAT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
PICKING
UP
RF
FROM
THE
RADAR
DETECTOR
ITSELF
MY
FIRST
REACTION
WAS
NO
WAY
BUT
GUESS
AGAIN
THESE
LITTLE
BUGGERS
REALLY
WORK
AND
THE
POLICE
ARE
WRITING
CITATIONS
RIGHT
AND
LEFT
FOR
PEOPLE
USING
RADAR
DETECTORS
ONE
NEWS
STORY
QUOTED
AN
OFFICER
AS
SAYING
THAT
HE
HAD
FOUND
THE
RADAR
DETECTOR
IN
ALL
OF
THE
CARS
HE
STOPPED
EXCEPT
ONE
AND
HE
COULD
NEVER
FIGURE
OUT
WHERE
IT
WAS
BUT
HE
KNEW
IT
WAS
THERE
THIS
TENDS
TO
MAKE
ONE
ASSUME
THERE
ARE
FEW
FALSE
ARREST
NOW
BEFORE
I
GET
FLAMED
PLEASE
UNDERSTAND
THAT
I
DO
DRIVE
AT
OR
NEAR
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
I
DO
NOT
NEED
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
TO
KEEP
ME
FROM
GETTING
A
SPEEDING
TICKET
BUT
I
DO
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHEN
MY
SPEED
IS
BEING
CLOCKED
OR
A
SPEED
TRAP
IS
FUNCTIONING
MY
RADAR
DETECTOR
NOW
STAYS
LOCKED
IN
MY
TRUNK
WHEN
I
AM
IN
VIRGINIA
WHICH
IS
WHAT
THEY
WANT
AND
YES
WHAT
THE
LAW
SAYS
AND
I
INTEND
TO
OBEY
THE
LAW
AND
IS
ONLY
USED
IN
STATES
WHERE
IT
IS
LEGAL
FOR
MY
FELLOW
HAMS
I
AM
NOT
A
MICROWAVE
PERSON
MY
MIND
ONLY
WORKS
IN
THE
HF
SPECTRUM
BETWEEN
AND
METERS
MICROWAVE
ENLIGHTMENT
MAY
BE
NECESSARY
SO
THE
QUESTIONS
ARE
WHAT

THE
