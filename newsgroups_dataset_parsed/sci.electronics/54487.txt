PEST
REPELLING
DEVICES
THE
ONES
IVE
SEEN
USE
PIEZOELECTRIC
TRANSDUCERS
DRIVEN
BY
A
KHZ
SWEPT
OSCILLATOR
IS
THERE
EVIDENCE
THAT
INSECTS
ARE
ACTUALLY
REPELLED
BY
THESE
DEVICES
CAN
ANYBODY
CITE
GOVT
PUBS
OR
INDEPENDENT
LAB
STUDIES
I
SAW
ANOTHER
DEVICE
THAT
SUPPOSEDLY
REPELS
PESTS
BY
ALTERING
THE
ELECTROMAGNETIC
FIELD
OF
YOUR
HOUSE
WIRING
I
SUPPOSE
THEY
CAPACITIVELY
COUPLE
A
HI
FREQ
SIGNAL
TO
THE
AC
WIRING
AND
THIS
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
REPEL
PESTS
HOW
BY
MAGNESTRICTION
OF
THE
WIRING
I
DONT
THINK
SO
IVE
BEEN
WONDERING
ABOUT
THIS
MYSELF
THE
HOUSE
WIRING
THING
IS
REALLY
HOKEY
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
HIGH
PRESSURE
ULTRASOUND
IS
ANNOYING
BUT
TO
WHOM
GIVEN
THAT
THESE
DEVICES
HAVE
BEEN
ADVERTISED
TO
BE
EFFECTIVE
AGAINST
EVERYTHING
FROM
INSECTS
TO
RODENTS
TO
NASTY
DOGS
WHAT
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
MY
INSECT
REPELLER
WONT
JUST
ANNNOY
MY
DOG
AND
GIVE
ME
HEADACHES
COULD
THERE
BE
THAT
MUCH
SELECTIVITY
IN
FREQUENCIES
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
ANY
STUDIES
ON
THE
EFFECTS
OF
VARIOUS
PRESSURE
LEVELS
BANDS
AND
SWEEP
PATTERNS
ON
VARIOUS
LIFE
FORMS
AND
HOW
EFFECTIVE
COULD
THEY
BE
I
CERTAINLY
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
TELL
ANYONE
THAT
THEY
ARE
SAFE
FROM
NASTY
DOGS
