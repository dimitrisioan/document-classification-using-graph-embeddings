what
is
pink
noise
and
how
is
it
used
in
sound
experiments
pink
noise
has
constant
power
per
geometric
frequency
increment
octave
octave
etc
thus
the
octave
has
the
same
amount
of
noise
power
as
the
octave
white
noise
has
constant
power
per
arithmetic
frequency
increment
hz
khz
etc
thus
the
band
has
the
same
amount
of
noise
power
as
the
band
both
bands
are
wide
pink
noise
can
be
made
by
passing
white
noise
thru
a
filter
usually
approximated
by
a
network
of
several
rc
pairs
note
you
cant
get
by
using
half
a
network
pink
noise
is
commonly
used
in
audio
power
response
measurements
it
shows
up
on
audio
spectrum
analyzers
with
octaverelated
bands
as
a
flat
line
across
the
bands
