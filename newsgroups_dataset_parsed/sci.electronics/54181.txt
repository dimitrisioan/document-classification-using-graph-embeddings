LEAD
ACID
BATTERIES
PART
I
THOUGHT
THE
FIRST
THREAD
WAS
HILARIOUS
SO
HERE
GOES
ANOTHER
POST
SOME
MORE
BACKGROUND
INFORMATION
ON
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED
TO
MY
POOR
BATTERIES
ONE
YEAR
I
LEFT
THE
BATTERIES
IN
THE
GARAGE
THE
GARAGE
IS
UNHEATED
THEY
WERE
LEFT
IN
THEIR
PLACES
THAT
THEY
NEEDED
TO
BE
ONE
IN
THE
RIDING
LAWNMOWER
WHAT
A
LUX
AND
ONE
IN
EACH
MOTORCYCLE
THE
BATTERY
IN
THE
RIDING
LAWNMOWER
WAS
ABOUT
YEARS
OLD
AND
ONE
OF
THE
CYCLE
BATTERIES
WAS
NEW
AND
ONE
WAS
AROUND
YEARS
OLD
UPON
SPRING
TIME
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
ALL
OF
THE
BATTERIES
WERE
DEAD
AND
NEEDED
TO
BE
RECHARGED
THEY
ALL
WORKED
PROPERLY
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
OLDER
ONES
AND
THEY
HAD
TO
BE
REPLACED
ABOUT
HALFWAY
THROUGH
THE
SUMMER
THEY
HAD
ORIGINALLY
BEEN
STORED
IN
THE
GARAGE
AND
I
THINK
I
REMEMBER
MY
DAD
CHARGING
THEM
IN
SPRING
LAST
YEAR
I
DECIDED
TO
BRING
THEM
IN
TO
THE
BASEMENT
WHICH
HAS
TWO
PARTS
ONE
IS
DIRT
AND
BRICK
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
CONCRETE
I
BROUGHT
IN
ALL
THREE
AND
DISCOVERED
IN
THE
SPRING
ABOUT
DAYS
AGO
THAT
NOT
ONLY
WERE
THE
BATTERIES
DEAD
BUT
WHEN
I
PUT
THE
CHARGER
ON
THEM
THE
CHARGER
SAID
HMMMMMMMM
AND
THE
AMPMETER
READ
AROUND
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IT
WAS
PINNED
THE
INTERNAL
CIRCUT
TRIPPED
AND
I
WENT
ON
TO
THE
OTHER
BATTERIES
THEY
WERE
THE
SAME
REALIZING
THAT
WE
STILL
HAD
GIGANTIC
SAILBOAT
BATTERIES
ALSO
LEAD
ACID
I
DECIDED
TO
PUT
THE
CHARGER
ON
THEM
THESE
HAD
BEEN
SITTING
FOR
AROUND
AND
A
HALF
YEARS
ON
THE
BRICK
AND
DIRT
PART
AND
NOTICED
THAT
THEY
ONLY
NEEDED
A
SMALL
CHARGE
AROUND
HOURS
OR
SO
ON
TRICKLE
I
TESTED
THEM
BY
USING
THEM
AT
THE
LOCAL
GAS
STATION
FOR
GIVING
JUMP
STARTS
AND
THEY
WORKED
FINE
FOR
AROUND
OF
EM
THIS
LEADS
ME
TO
BELIEVE
ONE
OF
SEVERAL
THINGS
I
BOUGHT
REALLY
TTY
BATTERIES
LAST
YEAR
SORTA
TRUE
THE
CONCRETE
HAS
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
DISCHARGE
OF
THE
BATTERIES
THERE
WAS
ENOUGH
MOISTURE
TO
SHORT
OUT
THE
TERMINALS
IN
THE
ROOM
WHERE
THE
CONCRETE
IS
THE
DIRT
ROOM
WAS
ABLE
TO
ABSORB
THE
MOISTURE
IN
THE
AIR
BETTER
THAN
CONCRETE
BTW
I
CAN
ALMOST
WATERSKI
IN
THE
DIRT
ROOM
ANY
OTHER
IDEAS
COULD
BE
THE
ALIENS
ANYTHING
IS
POSSIBLE
