noticed
the
largest
capacitor
with
a
very
bad
bulge
at
the
top
naturally
i
want
to
replace
it
but
i
cant
find
any
sources
the
electrolytic
capacitor
is
mf
at
it
has
radial
leads
and
is
roughly
inches
long
wide
the
dimensions
are
important

id
rather
check
out
a
store
to
compare
the
can
im
going
to
try
a
