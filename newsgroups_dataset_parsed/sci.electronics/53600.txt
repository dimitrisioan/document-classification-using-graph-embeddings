RUSS

SO
HERES
MY
QUESTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ID
HAVE
THE
SAME
ELECTRICAL
CIRCUIT
IF
I
HOOKED
THE
JUMPER
FROM
THE
NEUTRAL
OVER
TO
THE
GROUND
SCREW
ON
NEW
THREE
PRONG
GROUNDING
OUTLETS
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
MY
REASONING
HERE
WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
IF
YOU
WANT
THREEPRONG
OUTLETS
WITHOUT
ADDITIONAL
WIRING
IS
TO
USE
A
GFCI
OUTLET
OR
BREAKER
BUT
THE
OUTLET
WILL
BE
CHEAPER
IN
FACT
DEPENDING
ON
WHERE
YOU
ARE
PUTTING
YOUR
NEW
OUTLETS
A
GFCI
MAY
BE
REQUIRED
YOU
STILL
NEED
TO
SUPPLY
A
PROPER
GROUND
FOR
A
GROUND
FAULT
CIRCUIT
INTERRUPTER
SO
REWIRING
IS
STILL
A
PART
OF
THIS
JOB
HOWEVER
THE
GROUND
MAY
BE
CONNECTED
TO
A
LOCAL
EARTH
GROUND
RATHER
THAN
BACK
AT
THE
BREAKER
BOX
AS
JAMIE
SAID
GFCI
DEVICES
ARE
REQUIRED
BY
CODE
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
PLACES
MOST
NOTABLY
BATHROOMS
AND
OUTSIDE
THE
HOUSE
I
DO
SUGGEST
THE
USE
OF
GFCI
OUTLETS
RATHER
THAN
THE
BREAKERS
YOU
WILL
END
UP
WITH
MUCH
LESS
HEADACHES
NOISE
PICKUP
IN
LONG
CABLE
RUNS
IS
SOMETIMES
ENOUGH
TO
CAUSE
FREQUENT
TRIPPING
OF
THE
BREAKERS
GFCI
DEVICES
DO
SAVE
LIVES
IF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
INSTALL
THEM
BE
SURE
TO
CHECK
THEM
REGULARLY
USING
THE
TEST
BUTTON
RUNNING
THE
FAMILY
BUSINESS
ELECTRICAL
SUPPLIES
AND
LIGHTING
FOR
MANY
YEARS
I
HAVE
SEEN
TOO
MANY
SEASONED
ELECTRICIANS
FRIED
BECAUSE
THEY
FORGOT
TO
DOUBLE
CHECK
THEIR
COMMON
