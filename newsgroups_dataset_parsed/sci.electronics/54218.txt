RE
LASER
VS
BUBBLEJET
JUST
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
ADD
TO
DESKJET
THREAD
I
GOT
MY
FIRST
ONE
IN
COLLEGE
ABOUT
OR
SO
YEARS
AGO
IVE
BEEN
A
HAPPY
HP
USER
OF
THE
DESKWRITER
FOR
MACINTOSH
FOR
PAST
YEARS
I
GOT
ONE
JUST
A
FEW
MONTHS
AFTER
THEIR
RELEASE
AND
I
GOT
SOFTWARE
REVISION
NOW
IM
UP
TO
REV
OUR
FAMILY
SISTER
AND
FATHER
HAVE
EACH
PURCHASED
THEIR
OWN
DWS
AFTER
SEEING
MINE
GO
FOR
ONE
YEAR
UNSCATHED
THEIR
STUCK
TO
THEIR
TRUSTY
IMAGEWRITER
IIS
THE
ORIGINAL
DW
HAS
GONE
FOR
YEARS
AT
MODERATE
PERSONAL
USE
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
IT
HAS
GONE
THROUGH
AT
LEAST
SHEETS
AND
AROUND
ONE
SMALL
INK
CARTRIDGE
EVERY
MONTHS
OR
SO
MY
BROTHER
MIGHT
TAKE
THIS
DW
NOW
IM
PROBABLY
GONNA
GIVE
IT
TO
HIM
AND
I
AM
LOOKING
TO
UPGRADE
TO
A
COLOR
DW
THE
CHIEF
ADVANTAGESDISADVANTAGES
IVE
FOUND
OVER
THE
YEARS
ARE
ADVANTAGES
QUICK
PPM
QUIET
ROOMATE
CAN
SLEEP
WHILE
ITS
PRINTING
APPLETALK
NETWORKABLE
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
ORIGINAL
WASNT
SO
LOOK
OUT
IF
YOU
BUY
USED
I
REWIRED
OUR
HOME
WITH
PHONENET
APPLETALK
CONNECTORS
AND
WHILE
HOME
WE
CAN
ALL
USE
MY
DADS
ONE
DW
AND
CHEAP
NOW
RUN
BTW
YOU
CAN
UPGRADE
OLDER
DWS
TO
COLOR
OR
FOR
APPLETALK
I
DUNNO
IF
HP
STILL
DOES
THE
UPGRADES
BUT
I
RECEIVED
MANY
OFFERS
I
JUST
DIDNT
NED
IT
HOWEVER
ALSO
CRISP
LASERQUALITY
OUTPUT
IS
A
WONDER
USED
TO
REALLY
IMPRESS
THOSE
IMAGEWRITER
DOTMATRIX
PEOPLE
SO
MUCH
SO
THAT
I
HAD
TO
CHARGE
PER
SHEET
TO
STOP
MY
COLLEGE
DORM
NEIGHBORS
FROM
BOTHERING
ME
AT
ALL
HOURS
OF
THE
NIGHT
DISADVANTAGES
INK
USED
TO
BE
HARD
TO
FIND
AND
WASNT
CHEAP
AND
WASNT
ORIGINALLY
WATERPROOF
WHILE
HP
HAS
DONE
WONDERS
WITH
THE
INK
I
DUNNO
IF
ITS
STILL
TOXIC
IT
IS
STILL
SUBJET
TO
SMEARING
AND
RUNNING
IF
YOU
RUN
AROUND
IN
THE
DAMP
BOSTON
RAIN
AND
GET
YOUR
BOOKBAG
COMPLETELY
SOAKED
INK
NOW
RUNS
ABOUT
FOR
SMALL
CARTS
I
GET
MINE
FROM
ELEKTEK
IN
CHICAGO
I
THINK
THEYRE
NOW
DOWN
TO
THE
INK
CARTS
USED
TO
SAY
THEYRE
DATED
FOR
ONLY
MONTHS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THEY
SAY
SO
ANYMORE
WE
STICK
TO
A
MONTH
SUPPLY
OF
ABOUT
CARTS
WE
USE
CHEAP
HAMMERHILL
LASER
PRINT
PAPER
AFTER
FOOLING
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
LASERXEROX
PAPER
IS
ALSO
GOOD
SMEARING
DOESNT
HAPPEN
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
A
BRAND
NEW
INK
CART
AND
YOU
GRAB
THE
PAPER
AND
SMUDGE
IT
ALL
OVER
AS
SOON
AS
IT
COMES
OUT
OF
THE
MACHINE
OTHER
DISADVANTAGES
ARE
NO
POSTSCRIPT
THIS
CAN
BE
AN
ADVANTAGE
IN
SPEED
USUALLY
WAYS
AROUND
THIS
ARE
GHOSTSCRIPT
OR
FREEDOM
OF
PRESS
SOFTWARE
SOLUTIONS
I
BET
HP
PROBABLY
HAS
A
PS
PROTOTYPE
INKJET
BUT
THEY
WONT
RELEASE
IT
FOR
FEAR
OF
HURTING
LJ
SALES
IN
THE
END
THE
PRIMARY
ADVANTAGES
OF
LASER
ARE
TRUE
POSTSCRIPT
UNLESS
YOU
GO
FOR
CHEAP
LASERS
AND
FUSED
TONER
NO
SMEARING
EVEN
WHEN
SOAKING
IN
WATER
LASERS
ARE
SLIGHTLY
SHARPER
BUT
THE
ONLY
INSTANCE
WHERE
I
NEEDED
PRECISE
LAYOUTS
WAS
PRINTED

FOR

FOUND
