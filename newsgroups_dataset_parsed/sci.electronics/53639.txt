re
history
question
others
said
early
pa
i
recall
reading
of
a
phonograph
which
used
mechanical
amplification
compressed
air
was
squirted
out
of
a
valve
which
was
controlled
by
the
pickup
the
result
was
noisy
and
distinctly
lofi
but
much
louder
than
a
conventional
phonograph
it
tended
to
wear
the
disks
out
pretty
quickly
though
an
nowdeceased
prof
told
us
willing
students
about
a
project
he
had
worked
on
during
wwii
they
needed
a
megapower
pa
with
very
clear
audio
quality
the
purpose
was
to
bellow
at
refugees
from
aircraft
their
solution
was
a
giant
compressedair
source
and
a
horn
with
parallel
shutters
worked
by
a
small
audio
system
i
think
he
said
it
worked
very
well
thus
the
war
dept
cancelled
the
project
a
host
is
a
host
from
coast
to
no
one
will
talk
to
a
host
thats
unless
the
host
that
isnt
closepob
is
busy
hung
or
