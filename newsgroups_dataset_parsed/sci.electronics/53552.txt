questions
greetings
ive
been
seeing
the
word
storage
mentioned
around
oscilliscopes
but
im
curious
what
does
it
mean
if
my
life
depended
on
it
id
say
that
its
a
scope
that
uses
longpersistance
phosphor
to
keep
the
successive
taces
on
the
screen
for
some
unit
of
time

been
shopping
for
a
decent
used
old
scope
since
my
tek
portablenot
and
my
heathkit
are
all
single
trace
and
i
need
more
like
or
and
at
least
maybe
during
my
shopping
at
hamfests
etc
ive
run
into
the
problem
of
old
scope
terminology
i
can
imagine
what
a
mainframe
and
plugin
are
but
some
things
like
the
above
storage
coax
input

do
i
get
a
probe
that
fits
this
i
had
to
fiddle
with
mine
for
a
week
before
i
got
anything
resembling
a
good
trace
they
all
come
with
bnc
connectors
unblanking
huh
and
oh
just
like
my
manuals
many
changes
were
made
along
the
way
to
the
schematic
scopes
even
with
identical
model
numbers
have
different
better
responseperformance
than
others

can
i
pick
the
better
