held
breathalyzer

i
would

from
what
i
have
read
about
these
little
gadgets
it
works
on
a
electrochemical
galvanic
principle
the
sensing
unit
has
a
chemical
matrix
which
produces
an
electrical
voltage
proportional
to
the
amount
of
chemical
compound
it
is
designed
for
in
this
case
i
believe
it
is
the
hydroxyl
group
i
have
also
heard
not
tested
since
common
gasoline
is
also
a
member
of
this
hydroxyl
group
it
will
also
cause
a
failing
breathalizer
failure
next
time
you
get
stopped
for
dui
say
you
just
siphoned
gas
from
your
neighbors
car
you
know
the
oklahoma
credit
card
and
chances
are
you
wont
get
a
dui
ticket
