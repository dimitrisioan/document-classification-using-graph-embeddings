THE

HELD
BREATHALYZER
USED
BY
OUR

WORKS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
THIS

THE
MORE
GENERAL
PROBLEM

THANKS
WILLIAM
WILLIAMBEEUBCCA
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
READ
ABOUT
THESE
LITTLE
GADGETS
IT
WORKS
ON
A
ELECTROCHEMICAL
GALVANIC
PRINCIPLE
THE
SENSING
UNIT
HAS
A
CHEMICAL
MATRIX
WHICH
PRODUCES
AN
ELECTRICAL
VOLTAGE
PROPORTIONAL
TO
THE
AMOUNT
OF
CHEMICAL
COMPOUND
IT
IS
DESIGNED
FOR
IN
THIS
CASE
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
THE
HYDROXYL
GROUP
I
HAVE
ALSO
HEARD
NOT
TESTED
SINCE
COMMON
GASOLINE
IS
ALSO
A
MEMBER
OF
THIS
HYDROXYL
GROUP
IT
WILL
ALSO
CAUSE
A
FAILING
BREATHALIZER
FAILURE
NEXT
TIME
YOU
GET
STOPPED
FOR
DUI
SAY
YOU
JUST
SIPHONED
