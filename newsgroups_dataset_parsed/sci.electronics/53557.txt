WRITES
I
HAD
A
GE
EMERSON
COLOR
TV
FOR
ABOUT
YEARS
AND
ONE
FINE
DAY
WHILE
WE
WERE
WATCHING
SOMETHING
I
DOUBT
IF
THE
PROGRAM
WAS
THE
CAUSE
WE
HEARD
A
MILD
EXPLOSION
OUR
SCREEN
WENT
BLANK
BUT
THERE
WAS
SOUND
SO
WE
THOUGHT
OH
WE
HAVE
SPECIAL
EFFECTS
ON
THE
PROGRAM
BUT
SOON
THE
SOUND
STOPPED
AND
SMOKE
STARTED
TO
APPEAR
AT
THE
BACK
OF
THE
TV
THE
BRILLIANT
EES
WE
ARE
WE
UNPLUGGED
THE
TV
AND
CALLED
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
ONLY
TO
BE
THROWN
AROUND
BY
PLEASE
HOLD
I
WILL
TRANSFER
U
TO
BLAH
BLAH
FINALLY
WE
ABANDONED
THE
IDEA
OF
TRYING
TO
FIX
THE
TV
AND
GOT
A
NEW
ONE
WE
WANTED
A
BIGGER
ONE
TOO
AFTER
ALL
THE
STORY
WHAT
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
IS
IS
MY
PROBLEM
AN
ISOLATED
INCIDENT
OR
A
COMMON
ONE
I
RECALL
READING
ABOUT
RUSSIAN
TVS
EXPLODING
BUT
NOT
HERE
IN
THE
US
WHY
WOULD
THE
PICTURE
TUBE
EXPLODE
OR
EVEN
SMOKE
I
STILL
HAVE
THE
LEFT
OVER
TV
SET
I
MIGHT
DIG
INTO
IT
THIS
SUMMER
ANY
IDEA
WHERE
I
CAN
GET
PARTS
FOR
THESE
THINGS
PROBABLY
WILL
COST
MORE
THAN
TV
HEH
HEH
HEH
HEHI
LAUGH
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
DAMN
TV
AND
IT
DID
THE
SAME
THING
ACTUALLY
IT
IS
A
GOLDSTAR
BUT
ITS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
TV
AND
ELECTRONICSJUST
A
DIFFERENT
FACE
PLATE
AND
NAME
FORTUNATELY
TV
TUBES
DONT
EXPLODE
ID
THINK
THE
TV
MFRS
WANT
TO
MAKE
THIS
POSSIBILITY
REMOTE
AS
POSSIBLE
IF
AT
ALL
THEYLL
IMPLODE
AND
THE
GLASS
THAT
BLOWS
OUT
WOULD
BE
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
GLASS
BOUCING
OFF
THE
BACK
OF
THE
TUBE
DUE
TO
THE
IMPLOSION
IN
ANY
CASE
DONT
KICK
IT
AROUND
I
FIXED
THE
TV
AFTER
GETTING
A
HOLD
OF
SOME
SCHEMATICS
IT
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
A
BLOWN
RESISTOR
FEEDING
THE
FLYBACK
TRANSFORMER
I
GUESS
THE
ORIGINAL
RESISTOR
WAS
A
BIT
TOO
SMALL
TO
DISSIPATE
THE
HEAT
IT
CREATED
BURNING
ITSELF
OUT
I
CHECKED
TO
MAKE
SURE
THE
FLYBACK
WASNT
SHORTED
OR
ANYTHING
FIRST
OH
LUCKILY
I
HAD
A
RESISTOR
HANDY
LYING
AROUND
THAT
HAD
JUST
THE
RIGHT
VALUE
FOR
WHAT
I
NEEDED
I
CANT
SEE
IT
BEING
MORE
THAN
CENTS
WELL
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THE
TV
STILL
WORKS
TODAY
SO
GO
GET
A
SET
OF
SCHEMATICS
AND
HAVE
SOME
FUNJUST
DONT
GET
SHOCKED
POKING
AROUND
THE
FLYBACK
