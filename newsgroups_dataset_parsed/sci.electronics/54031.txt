WRITES
IF
COMPANIES
COMPRESSED
THEIR
EXECUTABLES
WITH
LZW
ANDD
DID
SOME
KIND
OF
ENCRYPTION
IN
THE
PROCESS
THIS
CHANGE
TWO
BYTES
HERE
THING
WOULD
GO
RIGHT
OUT
THE
WINDOW
NOT
ENTIRELY
TRUE
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
WAS
HAVING
TROUBLE
FINISHING
THE
GAME
GODS
AND
ASKED
ME
FOR
HELP
SINCE
HE
COULD
NOT
FIND
A
TRAINER
SMALL
PATCH
THAT
LETS
YOU
PLAY
WITHOUT
LOSING
LIFES
THE
GAME
IS
COMPRESSED
BUT
I
DID
FIND
ONE
BYTE
WHICH
WHEN
CHANGED
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
COMPRESSED
FILE
WOULD
NOT
AFFECT
THE
DECOMPRESSION
AND
WOULD
ALSO
PREVENT
THE
SHIELD
IN
THE
GAME
FROM
BEING
TURED
OFF
TURNING
THEREFORE
MAKING
YOU
INVINCIBLE
THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHER
PROGS
WHOSE
COPY
PROTECTION
WAS
DEFEATED
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
AND
I
HAVE
SEEN
EXAMPLES
OF
THIS
WITH
MY
OWN
EYES
THE
COPY
PROTECTION
SCHEMES
DEFEATED
WERE
VARIOUS
SUCH
AS
USING
PROTECTED
MODE
COMPRESSED
EXECUTABLES
PROGS
THAT
LOAD
AND
EXECUTE
OTHER
PROGS
POSSIBLY
COMPRESSED
DONGLES
KEY
DISKS
ETC
I
BELIEVE
THAT
PERSISTENCE
OVERCOMES
EVEN
THE
VERY
BEST
