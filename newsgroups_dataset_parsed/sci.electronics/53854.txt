DIGITAL
VOLTMETER
HOW
DOES
IT
WORK
HELLO
LET
ME
INTRODUCE
A
PROBLEM
WHEN
I
MEASURE
A
SINUSOIDAL
WAVE
VOLTAGE
WITH
A
DIGITAL
VOLTMETER
USING
AC
MODE
MY
OUTPUT
IS
AN
RMS
VALUE
A
PEAK
VALUE
OVER
SQUARED
RIGHT
WHEN
I
MEASURE
A
SQUARE
WAVE
IN
THE
SAME
MODE
AC
MY
OUTPUT
IS
EQUAL
TO
A
PEAK
VALUE
ACTUALLY
TO
THE
UPPER
FLAT
BOUNDARY
OF
THE
WAVE
I
ASSUMED
THAT
A
DIGITAL
VOLTMETER
MAKES
SOME
KIND
OF
INTEGRATION
OF
THE
INPUT
VALUE
AND
DIVIDES
IT
OVER
THE
WAVE
PERIOD
RIGHT
NOW
I
USED
IT
TO
MEASURE
THE
SAME
SQUARE
WAVE
AS
ABOVE
BUT
DISTORTED
BY
HIGHFREQUENCY
HARMONICS
IDEALLY
OUTPUT
SHOULD
BE
THE
SAME
BUT
THE
OUTPUT
VALUE
WAS
ONLY
ABOUT
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
ONE
WHY
WHAT
IS
THE
NATURE
OF
THIS
OUTPUT
VALUE
WHAT
DOES
THE
VOLTMETER
ACTUALLY
MEASURE
AND
WHAT
DOES
IT
SHOW
RELATED
QUESTION
LESS
IMPORTANT
TO
ME
WHAT
ARE
ADVANTAGES
AND
DISADVANTAGES
OF
DIGITAL
VOLTMETERS
TO
COMPARE
WITH
ANALOG
ONES
THANK
YOU
FOR
YOUR
ATTENTION
YOU
COULD
MAIL
ME
YOUR
OPINION
AT
OR
OPEN
A
DISCUSSION
HERE
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
EITHER
WAY
