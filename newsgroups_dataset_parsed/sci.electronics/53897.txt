DETECTORS
SEVERAL
YEARS
BACK
ONE
OF
THE
RADAR
DETECTORS
MANUFACTURERS
IN
DEFIANCE
TO
VIRGINIAS
LAW
AGAINST
RADAR
DETECTORS
PASSED
OUT
THOUSANDS
OF
FAKE
CARDBOARD
RADAR
DETECTORS
AT
TRUCK
STOPS
NEAR
THE
VIRGINIA
STATE
LINES
AT
THAT
TIME
THERE
WERE
NO
RADAR
DETECTOR
DETECTORS
I
AM
NOT
SURE
OF
THE
IMPACT
BUT
I
WOULD
IMAGINE
THAT
ENFORCEMENT
OF
THE
LAW
BY
VISUALLY
SIGHTING
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
BECAME
DIFFICULT
IF
NOT
IMPOSSIBLE
AS
I
SAID
EARLIER
EFFORTS
TO
THROW
OUT
OR
ELIMINATE
THE
VA
LAW
AGAINST
RADAR
DETECTORS
HAS
BEEN
IN
VAIN
IN
FACT
EFFECTIVE
JAN
THE
FINE
FOR
POSSESSION
OF
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
ACCESSABLE
TO
THE
DRIVER
OF
A

IN
VA
IS
NOW
I
HAVE
NOTED
AN
INTERESTING
ANOMALITY
WITH
MY
ALINCO
METER
HAM
TRANSCEIVER
IT
WILL
MAKE
A
CHEAP
RADAR
DETECTOR
SCREAM
I
AM
NOT
SURE
OF
THE
RANGE
BUT
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
BY
THE
BRAKE
LIGHTS
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
AT
LEAST
FEET
AT
WATTS
RANDY
T
AGEE
AT
SOME
POINT
YOU
PROBABLY
PONDERED
THE
PO
BOX
FLOOR
MEANING
OF

AND
YOU
CAME
UP
WITH
A
VIRGINIA

OF

SATISFACTORY
ANSWER
WHICH
HAS
OR
HAS
NOT
RICHMOND

STOOD
THE
