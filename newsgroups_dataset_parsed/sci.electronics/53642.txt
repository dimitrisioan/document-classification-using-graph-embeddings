im
doing
sound
for
a
couple
of
bands
around
here
and
we
need
direct
input
boxes
for
the
keyboards
these
are
the
little
boxes
that
take
a
line
level
out
of
the
keyboard
and
transform
it
into
lowz
for
the
run
to
the
mixer
sadly
they
cost
like
or
more
each
and
im
going
to
need
like
or
of
them
i
looked
inside
one
belonging
to
another
band
and
it
looks
like
just
a
transformer
does
anyone
have
any
plans
for
building
them
each
dont
bother
trying
to
make
one
yourself
just
shop
around
a
little
ive
found
dod
brand
di
boxes
for
as
cheap
as
each
you
can
get
higher
end
ones
for
more
but
for
pa
use
for
bands
i
wouldnt
bother
making
one
yourself
might
work
but
getting
a
sturdy
enough
enclosure
might
be
hard
theyre
made
of
heavy
guage
metal
since
theyre
always
on
the
floor
being
kicked
around
a
lot
for
any
additional
questions

this
topic
