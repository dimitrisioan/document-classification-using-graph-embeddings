there
is
one
wild
difference
between
the
two
printers
a
laserprinter
is
a
page
printer
whilst
an
inkjet
is
a
line
printer
this
means
that
a
laserprinter
can
rotate
graphic
images
whilst
an
inkjet
cannot
few
drivers
actually
use
this
facility
there
is
also
the
matter
of
downloadable
fonts
and
so
on
tc
email
tchannonblackdemoncouk
or
tchannoncixcompulinkcouk
i
have
a
deskjet
and
i
thought
id
give
a
little
info
the
deskjet
will
do
landscape
mode
like
the
hp
laserjets
i
cant
say
if
other
inkjets
do
though
also
the
deskjet
can
do
downloadable
fonts
only
if
you
buy
a
softfont
memory
cart
for
it
oh
you
said
the
laserjet
can
rotate
a
graphic
image
hmmmmm
the
deskjet
can
only
rotate
text
nevermind
