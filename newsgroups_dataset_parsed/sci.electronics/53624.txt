A
QUESTION
ABOUT
OUTLET
WIRING
CRISPECSVAXUNCECSEDU
RUSS
CRISP
WRITES
SO
HERES
MY
QUESTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ID
HAVE
THE
SAME
ELECTRICAL
CIRCUIT
IF
I
HOOKED
A
JUMPER
FROM
THE
NEUTRAL
OVER
TO
THE
GROUND
SCREW
ON
NEW
THREE
PRONG
GROUNDING
OUTLETS
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
MY
REASONING
HERE
MAY
I
RESPECTFULLY
SUGGEST
YOU
NOT
DO
THIS
THE
GROUND
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
A
PROTECTIVE
GROUND
AND
THOUGH
WHAT
YOU
SUGGEST
LOOKS
GOOD
ON
PAPER
ITS
DANGEROUS
TO
RELY
ON
THE
SAME
WIRE
FOR
POWER
AND
PROTECTION
ITD
NEVER
MEET
CODE
AND
IF
YOU
NOW
OWN
THE
PROPERTY
AND
LATER
SELL
IT
YOU
MAY
END
UP
WITH
LIABILITIES
YOU
DONT
WANT
AND
IF
YOU
DONT
NOW
OWN
IT
WELL
THERES
A
WIRING
FAQ
THAT
I
THINK
ADDRESSES
THIS
I
BELIEVE
AN
ALTERNATIVE
IS
USE
OF
A
GFCI
BUT
IM
REALLY
NOT
SURE
WHAT
CURRENT
CODE
ALLOWS
IN
THIS
AREA
THE
GFCI
SENSES
ALTERNATE
UNWANTED
CURRENT
PATHS
AND
DOESNT
RELY
ON
A
SPECIFIC
PROTECTIVE
GROUND
WIRE
AT
LEAST
NOT
BEYOND
THE
GFCI
IN
THE
PROTECTED
CIRCUIT
GFCI
BREAKERS
ARE
AVAILABLE
BUT
EXPENSIVE
