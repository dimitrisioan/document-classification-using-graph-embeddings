switching
ps
questions
greetings
ive
recently
decided
to
chuck
the
linear
regulators
and
learn
the
black
magic
art
of
switching
power
supplies
before
anyone
flames
me
i
know
both
have
their
place
anyways
ive
built
the
basic
up
down
converters
with
pretty
good
results
efficiency
but
im
running
into
problems
when
i
try
to
design
build
anything
that
puts
out
serious
amps
i
know
it
can
be
done
i
have
some
guts
on
my
bench
but
something
puzzles
me
im
using
a
simple
choke
as
the
storage
element
basicly
a
toroid
with
a
single
winding
but
all
commercial
models
use
transformers
with
many
windings
i
traced
a
few
and
they
seem
to
use
some
of
the
winding
for
the
usual
errorfeedback
but
some
of
the
others
seem
to
loose
me
what
are
they
for
better
than
that
anyone
have
a
full
schematic
for
one
of
these
that
i
could
get
a
copy
of
id
love
to
see
how
they
manage
to
squeeze
out
so
much
from
such
low
volume
my
other
problems
in
getting
high
amps
good
efficiency
are
lack
of
sources
of
ideal
components
calculated
and
limited
knowledge
of
the
whole
topic
im
doing
this
on
my
own
not
school
mind
you
in
fact
i
have
yet
to
take
any
course
that
covers
transistors
so
is
the
answer
to
the
accumulation
of
dead
commercial
models
and
truning
into
a
scavanger
not
that
its
not
what
im
doing
now
and
getting
understanding
schematics
and
a
bit
more
of
the
mindboggling
theory
take
care
ps
my
goal
is
in
car
battery
out
and
on
the
other
end
and
the
distance
between
the
two
will
be
more
than
feet
of
gauge
but
less
than
feet
would
like
to
have
a
working
model
in
a
year
or
so
do
i
have
a
chance
to
make
it

ill
buy
