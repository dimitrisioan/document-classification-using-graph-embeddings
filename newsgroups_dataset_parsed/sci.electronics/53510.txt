folks
here
in
the
dallas
area
i
have
noticed
that
it
is
quite
common
to
see
an
odd
sensor
on
top
of
traffic
lights
these
have
been
here
for
at
least
six
years
ive
often
wondered
what
they
are
mike

texas
instruments
inc
of
all
statistics
are
made
here
in
erie
pa
there
is
a
system
in
the
inner
city
called
radolite
a
trade
name
which
allows
police
and
ambulance
vehicles
to
gain
right
of
way
by
controlling
traffic
lights
through
radio
signals
the
receivers
look
much
like
what
you
describe
but
they
include
a
uhf
whip
antenna
less
than
a
foot
tall
and
a
light
which
flashes
on
and
off
to
let
traffic
know
that
an
emergency
vehicle
has
taken
control
and
is
approaching
local
folklore
says
this
system
was
invented
here
i
dont
know
if
this
company
has
any
other
installations
it
has
been
in
operation
for
at
least
years
going
only
by
my
memory
