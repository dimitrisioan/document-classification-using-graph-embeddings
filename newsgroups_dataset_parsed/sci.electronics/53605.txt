AM
AN

AND
ITS
A
MUST
THAT
I
GET
FAMILIAR
WITH
SPICE
I
HAVE
BEEN
USING
IT
AND
GETTING
USED
TO
IT
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
GREAT
TO
HAVE
A
GOOD
REFERENCE
MANUAL
THAT
EXPLAINS
EVERYTHING
IN
AN
ORGANIZED
AND
CONCISE
I
CURRENT
HAVE
A
GUIDE
TO
CIRCUIT
SIMULATION
ANALYSIS
USING
SPICE
I
FEEL
IT
HAS
THE
INFORMATION
IS
JUST
RANDOMLY
PLACED
IN
THE
BOOK
AND
ITS
NOT
EASY
TO
LOOK
UP
SMALL
THINGS
WHEN
YOU
JUST
NEED
A
GOOD
REFERENCE
BOOK
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
INFO
