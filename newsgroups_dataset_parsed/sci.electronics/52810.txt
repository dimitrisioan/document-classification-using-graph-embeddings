electric
power
line
balls
i
got
a
question
from
my
dad
which
i
really
cant
answer
and
id
appreciate
some
netwisdom
his
question
is
about
some
diameter
balls
which
are
attached
to
electric
power
lines
in
his
area
hes
seen
up
to
a
half
dozen
between
two
poles
neither
of
us
have
any
experience
with
electric
power
distribution
my
only
guess
was
that
they
may
be
a
capacitive
device
to
equalize
the
inductance
of
the
grid
but
why
so
many
between
two
poles
anyone
know
what
they
really
are
is
there
a
related
faq
for
this
is
there
a
better
group
to
submit
to
wed
both
appreciate
some
enlightenment
