RANDALL
RHEA
WRITES
GREG
STOVALL
WRITES
ANYWAY
OVER
THE
WEEKEND
I
WAS
RESTING
ON
THE
SOFA
IN
BETWEEN
CHORES
AND
NOTICED
THAT
I
BRIEFLY
PICKED
UP
WHAT
SOUNDED
LIKE
HAM
RADIO
TRAFFIC
OVER
MY
STEREO
AND
TELEVISION
EVEN
THOUGH
BOTH
WERE
OFF
ALSO
ALL
THE
TOUCH
SENSITIVE
LIGHTS
IN
MY
HOUSE
START
GOING
WACKO
CYCLING
THROUGH
THEIR
FOUR
BRIGHTNESS
STATES
I
PRESUME
THAT
SOME
HAM
OPERATOR
WITH
AN
ILLEGAL
AMPLIFIER
DROVE
PAST
MY
HOUSE
I
LIVE
ON
A
BUSY
THOROUGHFARE
WOULD
THIS
BE
A
CORRECT
PRESUMPTION
WHAT
KIND
OF
POWER
MUST
HE
BE
PUTTING
OUT
TO
CAUSE
THE
EFFECTS
THE
AFFECTED
EQUIPMENT
IS
ABOUT
FEET
FROM
THE
ROAD
HAMS
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
HAVE
AN
ILLEGAL
AMP
AND
ARE
ALSO
UNLIKELY
TO
HAVE
A
DIRTY
AMP
HAMS
CAN
LEGALLY
RUN
UP
TO
WATTS
IT
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
HOWEVER
THAT
A
HAM
WOULD
BE
RUNNING
THAT
KIND
OF
POWER
FROM
A
CAR
HAM
RIGS
NOT
POSSIBLE
EITHER
YOUD
NEED
ABOUT
A
AMP
ALTERNATOR
FOR
JUST
THE
AMPLIFIER
I
CAN
JUST
SEE
IT
YOU
NEED
TO
SLOW
DOWN
ON
A
DOWNGRADE
SO
YOU
HIT
THE
PUSH
TO
TALK
BUTTON
FOR
CARS
PUT
OUT
AROUND
WATTS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
A
WATT
RADIO
WOULD
CAUSE
INTERFERENCE
TO
CONSUMER
ELECTRONIC
FEET
AWAY
MOST
TVS
STEREOS
AND
VCRS
HAVE
VERY
POOR
RF
SHIELDING
IF
YOU
EXPERIENCE
THE
PROBLEM
FREQUENTLY
IT
MAY
BE
CAUSED
BY
A
HAM
CBER
OR
OTHER
RADIO
OPERATOR
IN
A
BASE
STATION
NEARBY
THE
INTERFERENCE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
CAUSED
BY
A
RADIO
TRANSMITTER
USED
FOR
OTHER
PURPOSES
SUCH
AS
POLICE
FIRE
ETC
IF
YOU
HEARD
VOICES
OVER
YOUR
STEREO
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
IN
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
SOURCE
IS
AN
RF
TRANSMITTER
IF
YOU
HAVE
FREQUENT
TROUBLE
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
TRY
THE
RF
FERRITE
CHOKES
AVAILABLE
AT
RADIO
SHACK
THE
INTERFERENCE
IS
PROBABLY
BEING
PICKED
UP
BY
YOUR
SPEAKER
WIRES
AND
THOSE
CHOKES
CAN
BE
INSTALLED
ON
THE
WIRES
VERY
EASILY
WITHOUT
CUTTING
THEM
GOOD
INSTRUCTIONS
ARE
INCLUDED
WITH
THE
CHOKES
IF
THAT
DOES
NOT
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
SEARCH
YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR
A
RADIO
OPERATOR
LOOK
FOR
ANTENNAS
ON
THE
ROOF
OR
CAR
TALK
TO
HIMHER
ABOUT
YOUR
PROBLEM
THERE
ARE
THINGS
A
RADIO
OPERATOR
CAN
DO
TO
REDUCE
INTERFERENCE
AND
PLEASE
REMEMBER
TO
BE
FRIENDLY
WHEN
APPROACHING
YOUR
LOCAL
RADIO
OPERATOR
THIS
PERSON
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
CAUSE
OF
YOUR
TROUBLES
AND
YOULL
GET
BETTER
COOPERATION
AND
HELP
IF
YOU
ASSUME
THAT
HE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
HELPFUL
MOST
ARE
IT
WAS
AMAZING
THE
ACCUSATIONS
THAT
WE
SOMETIMES
DEALT
WITH
AS
I
GREW
UP
WE
WERE
BLAMED
FOR
SKIP
GHOST
PICTURES
ON
THE
TV
THAT
OCCUR
AT
SUNSPOT
PEAKS
CB
INTERFERANCE
DEAD
GRASS
YOU
NAME
IT
BTW
THE
LOCAL
OPERATOR
SHOULD
TRY
AND
HELP
YOU
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HE
OR
SHE
IS
DIRECTLY
RESPONSIBLE
IT
IS
PART
OF
BEING
A
GOOD
NEIGHBOR
AND
THAT
IS
HOW
THE
FCC
VIEWS
IT
TOO
BAD
THEY
DONT
REQUIRE
THE
CONSUMER
EQUIPMENT
MAKERS
TO
TAKE
ANY
PRECAUTIONS
LAST
YOU
CAN
USUALLY
TELL
HAM
RADIO
VS
CB
HAM
OPERATORS
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
DECLARE
THEIR
CALL
SIGN
EVERY
SO
MANY
MINUTES
NO
MORE
THAN
SO
IF
YOU
HEAR
THIS
IS
OR
SOME
OTHER
CALL
STARTING
WITH
A
W
OR
K
AND
NO
MORE
THAN
TOTAL
CHARACTERS
YOU
HEARD
A

PROBABLY
WONT

I
DONT
