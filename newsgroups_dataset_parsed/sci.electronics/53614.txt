i
was
wondering
if
anyone
could
provide
me
with
some
information
as
to
how
to
construct
a
homebuilt
battery
in
my
grade
school
days
i
remember
seeing
the
ice
cube
tray
version
but
i
dont
remember
what
to
use
as
a
good
electrolyte
or
what
the
easily
obtainable
metals
were

the
simplest
one
is
easy
take
a
lemon
or
other
citrus
type
fruit
and
stick
a
pair
of
metal
strips
into
it
for
the
contacts
the
two
strips
must
be
of
disimelar
metals
like
copper
and
zinc
then
connect
a
voltmeter
to
the
contacts
and
read
the
voltage
