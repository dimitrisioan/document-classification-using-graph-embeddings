writes
as
is
typical
nowadaze
you
will
probably
have
to
do
somebody
elses
job
for
them
although
this
shouldnt
be
needed
you
might
take
a
few
minutes
to
wander
around
the
neighborhood
with
an
ht
sniffing
for
cable
leakage
on
your
freq
after
shutting
down
your
system
for
a
while
if
you
are
fortunate
enough
to
the
find
the
hole
call
the
cable
company
and
get
the
highest
link
in
the
chain
of
command
you
can
explain
the
problem
whose
job
it
really
is
to
maintain
their
equipment
and
how
much
of
a
nice
guy
you
are
to
have
tracked
down
their
problem
for
them
you
may
have
been
lucky
and
made
a
new
contact
that
could
be
helpful
in
the
future
you
should
always
try
the
honey
approach
before
bringing
out
the
jack
nicholson
impressions
this
has
worked
for
me
in
the
past
with
the
power
company
when
tring
to
find
loosenoisy
high
voltage
lineshardware
only
once
did
i
have
to
tell
them
i
was
narrowing
the
problem
down
to
a
specific
pole
by
bumping
a
whole
line
of
poles
with
my
car
got
em
out
there
that
night
and
they
didnt
have
to
meet
jack
as
a
disclaimer
their
method
for
finding
loose
hardware
was
usually
whacking
the
poles
with
a
huge
sledgehammer
after
their
high
tech
arc
finding
scope
couldnt
find
the
problem
bill
rotten
zucchini
garden
here
in
switzerland
the
situation
is
exactly
the
same
the
cable
tv
companies
even
tried
to
stop
amateur
radio
in
switzerland
in
the
beginning
of
cable
tvthey
seem
to
be
too
stupid
to
know
anything
about
international
frequency
conferences
or
so
even
today
they
use
the
cheapest
possible
coax
running
into
problems
they
cant
solve
anymore
as
bill
noted
the
only
way
is
to
look
for
a
solution
with
the
neighbours
before
calling
for
the
cable
tv
guys
or
the
fcc
the
chance
to
find
neighbours
with
some
sense
for
reason
is
by
far
bigger
than
with
these
people
especially
the
first
ones
as
anywhere
in
an
administration
people
dont
like
if
you
tell
them
to
work
for
the
money
they
get
the
problem
is
that
radio
amateurs
dont
have
the
power
to
put
trough
their
rights
in
all
cases
so
lets
hope
they
start
soon
with
optical
fibers
and
get
out
of
our
freqencies
