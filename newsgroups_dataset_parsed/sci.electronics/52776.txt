QUESTION
IF
I
AM
RIGHT
ABOUT
THE
DOPPLERIF
I
SPELL
IT

EVERY
TIME
MAYBE
ONE
WILL
BE
RIGHT
EFFECT
HOW
DOES
THE
RADAR
GET
AN
ACCURATE
READING
WHEN
THE
CAR
CONTAINING
IT
IS
MOVING
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
FOR
ALL
THATS
WORTH
THAT
IT
WOULD
NEED
TO
BE
CALIBRATED
WITH
THE
SPEEDOMETER
OF
THE
CAR
CONTAINING
IT
I
AM
FAIRLY
SURE
THIS
ISNT
THE
CASE
SO
WHATS
THE
DEAL
ESSENTIALLY
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
HOW
IT
IS
DONE
THE
RADAR

IS
TIED

THE
SPEEDOMETER
OF
THE
CAR

IT
IS
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
SPEEDOMETER
THE

TWO

CAR

HAD
A
GOOD
ARTICLE
ON

RADAR
BUT
IT
WAS
BACK
IN
I
USED
ITS
CONTENTS
AND
REFERENCES
TO
DEFEND
MYSELF
AGAINST
A
BOGUS
RADARMEASURED
TICKET
IT
DETAILED
MOVING

WHICH
IS
EASIER
TO
DEFEND
AGAINST
