DEHYDRATORS
DOES
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
HAVE
ONE
OF
THOSE
FOOD
DEHYDRATORS
IVE
BEEN
SEEING
ALL
OVER
LATENIGHT
TV
RECENTLY
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
THEY
USE
FORCED
AIR
HEA
OR
BOTH
IF
THERES
HEAT
INVOLVED
ANYBODY
KNOW
WHAT
TEMPERATURE
THEY
RUN
AT
MY
WIFE
WOULD
LIKE
ONE
AND
IM
NOT
INCLINED
TO
PAY
FOR
A
BOX
A
FAN
AND
A
HEATER
SEEMS
TO
ME
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
THROW
A
DEHYDRATOR
TOGETHER
FOR
JUST
A
FEW
BUCKS
HECK
THE
TECHNOLOGY
IS
ONLY
WHAT
YEARS
OLD
YOU
CAN
LEARN
HOW
TO
BUILD
A
DEYHDRATOR
VERY
EASILY
FROM
THE
BOOK
THE
HUNGRY
HIKERS
GUIDE
TO
GOOD
FOOD
BY
GRETCHEN
MCHUGH
THE
HEAT
SOURCE
IS
A
WATT
LIGHT
BULB
BASICALLY
ITS
A
VERTICAL
WOODEN
BOX
WITH
VENTILATION
HOLES
IN
THE
TOP
AND
BOTTOM
LOTS
OF
THEM
YOU
WANT
THE
AIR
TO
FLOW
THE
LIGHT
BULB
GOES
IN
THE
BOTTOM
AND
WIRE
CAKE
RACKS
ARE
SPACED
EVERY
STARTING
ABOUT
ABOVE
THE
BULB
OR
AT
A
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
COST
IN
ELECTRICITY
YOU
CAN
DO
WHAT
I
DO
USE
YOUR
OVEN
NOTE
I
DO
THIS
IN
AN
ELECTRIC
OVEN
SOME
GAS
OVENS
MAY
NOT
HAVE
A
LOW
ENOUGH
SETTING
PUT
FOOD
TO
BE
DRIED
ON
COOKIE
TINS
OR
RACKS
IN
THE
OVEN
SET
OVEN
TO
DEGREES
THE
LOWEST
SETTING
ON
MY
OVEN
IF
YOURS
GOES
DOWN
TO
THATS
PROBABLY
EVEN
BETTER
STICK
A
WOODEN
SPOON
OR
SOMETHING
ACROSS
THE
FRONT
CORNER
OF
THE
OVEN
AND
CLOSE
THE
DOOR
ON
THE
SPOON
SO
THAT
IT
STAYS
OPEN
ABOUT
AN
INCH
THIS
ALLOWS
FOR
AIRFLOW
LEAVE
THE
STUFF
IN
THE
OVEN
FOR
TO
HOURS
CHECK
IT
OFTEN
SINCE
THIS
DRIES
IT
MUCH
FASTER
THAN
THE
DEHYDRATOR
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
COOKIE
SHEETS
INSTEAD
OF
RACKS
TURN
THE
STUFF
OVER
HALFWAY
THROUGH
IF
YOU
WANT
MORE
INFO
EMAIL
ME

THIS
ISNT
REALLY
THE
RIGHT
