i
was
wondering
if
people
had
any
good
uses
for
old
simms
i
have
a
bunch
of
them
for
the
apple
mac
and
i
know
lots
of
other
people
do
to
i
have
tried
to
sell
them
but
have
gotten
no
interest
so
if
you
have
an
inovative
use
or
want
to
buy
some
simms
i
would
be
very
interested
in
hearing
about
it
the
most
practical
use
ive
seen
for
them
is
as
key
ring
ornaments
johnh
i
used
a
bunch
as
weights
when
building
a
model
airplane
hung
them
on
the
stringers
across
the
stringer
or
whatever
worked
pretty
well
