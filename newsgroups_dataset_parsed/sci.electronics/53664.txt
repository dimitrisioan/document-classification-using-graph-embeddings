I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
PEOPLE
HAD
ANY
GOOD
USES
FOR
OLD
SIMMS
I
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
THEM
FOR
THE
APPLE
MAC
AND
I
KNOW
LOTS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
DO
TO
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
SELL
THEM
BUT
HAVE
GOTTEN
NO
INTEREST
SO
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
INOVATIVE
USE
OR
WANT
TO
BUY
SOME
SIMMS
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
ABOUT
IT
THE
MOST
PRACTICAL
USE
IVE
SEEN
FOR
THEM
IS
AS
KEY
RING
ORNAMENTS
JOHNH
I
USED
A
BUNCH
AS
WEIGHTS
WHEN
BUILDING
A
MODEL
AIRPLANE
HUNG
THEM
ON
THE
STRINGERS
ACROSS
THE
STRINGER
OR
WHATEVER
WORKED
PRETTY
WELL
