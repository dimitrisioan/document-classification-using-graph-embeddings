RANDALL
RHEA
WRI
HAMS
CAN
LEGALLY
RUN
UP
TO
WATTS
IT
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
HOWEVER
THAT
A
HAM
WOULD
BE
RUNNING
THAT
KIND
OF
POWER
FROM
A
CAR
HAM
RIGS
NOT
POSSIBLE
EITHER
YOUD
NEED
ABOUT
A
AMP
ALTERNATOR
FOR
JUST
THE
AMPLIFIER
I
CAN
JUST
SEE
IT
YOU
NEED
TO
SLOW
DOWN
ON
A
DOWNGRADE
SO
YOU
HIT
THE
PUSH
TO
TALK
BUTTON
NOW
THAT
INDEED
IS
POSSIBLE
A
GOOD
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IS
RUNNING
ABOUT
KW
PEP
FROM
HIS
CAR
YES
HE
DOES
HAVE
A
SECOND
ALTERNATOR
YES
HE
CALLS
THE
RIG
AN
ELECTRONIC
BRAKE
SINCE
THE
ENGINE
NOTICEABLY
SLOWS
WHEN
THE
KEY
IS
DOWN
IT
HAS
BEEN
A
WHILE
SINCE
I
KNEW
THE
ELECTRONICS
OF
HAM
RADIO
BUT
I
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
PEP
IS
ACTUALLY
THE
REAL
POWER
WHICH
MAKES
PEP
ACTUALLY
AROUND
OR
WAS
IT
I
DISREMEMBER
EFFECTIVE
TRANSMITTED
POWER
IS
ALSO
ODD
IN
THAT
IT
TAKES
INTO
ACCOUNT
ANTENNA
HEIGHT
AND
GEOMETRY
WHICH
IS
WHY
A
TV
STATION
WITH
A
KLYSTRON
MIGHT
ADVERTISE
A
MEGAWATT
IF
THEIR
ANTENNA
IS
ON
THE
TOP
OF
THE
CN
TOWER
THIS
IS
LIKE
SEARS
HP
THOUGH
REAL
WATTS
STILL
ISNT
IMPOSSIBLE
ABOUT
WITH
A
ALTERNATOR
LESS
IF
THE
ALTERNATOR
PRODUCES
HIGHER
VOLTAGES
ITS
ONLY
THREE
HORSEPOWER
TAKING
INTO
ACCOUNT
INEFFICIENCIES
YOULL
FEEL
IT
WHEN
YOU
HIT
THE
KEY
BUT
NOT
TOO
MUCH
