RE
ELECTRONIC
ODOMETERS
I
HAD
THE
INSTURMENT
PANEL
GO
OUT
IN
MY
CAR
A
LINCOLN
CONTENINTAL
WHICH
IS
A
DIGITAL
DASH
THEY
REPLACED
THE
WHOLE
THING
WITH
A
DASH
THANK
GOD
IT
WAS
UNDER
THE
WARRENTY
ANYWAY
THE
ODOMETER
WAS
READING
THE
EXACT
MILAGE
FROM
THE
OLD
PANEL
IT
MUST
HAVE
A
EEPROM
OF
SOME
SORT
IN
IT
THAT
IS
UPDATED
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
REMOVING
THE
BATTERY
WOULD
ERASE
IT
BUT
IT
DOESNT
SO
I
GUESS
THEY
SWAPPED
THE
NVM
CHIP
NONVOLITILE
MEMORY
AND
INSTALLED
IT
IN
THE
NEW
DASH
NO
THEY
WOULDNT
LET
ME
HAVE
THE
OLD
DASH
TO
TINKER
WITH
WES
