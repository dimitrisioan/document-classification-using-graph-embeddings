WROTE
THE
PROGRAM
IS
DEFINITELY
BACKUPABLE
IF
RESTORED
TO
THE
SAME
MACHINE
DEPENDS
ON
THE
PROGRAMMER
DONT
USE
A
DISK
DRIVE
CHARACTERISTIC
IF
THE
USER
DID
AN
UPGRADE
TO
THE
MACHINE
HESHE
SHOULD
REINSTALL
ALL
PROGRAMS
ANY
WAY
NO
DOCUMENT
LOOKUP
NO
DISK
WEARANDTEAR
THIS
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
I
UPGRADED
MY
MOTHERBOARD
LAST
FALL
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
PISSED
AT
ANY
SOFTWARE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
FORCED
ME
TO
REINSTALL
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
I
CHANGED
MOTHERBOARDS
ANY
INFO
IN
THE
BIOS
IS
TOO
VOLATILE
TO
USE
AS
A
CHECKSUM
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
REQUIRE
THAT
A
USER
REINSTALL
ALL
THEIR
SOFTWARE
IF
THEY
ADD
OF
RAM
TO
THEIR
COMPUTER
I
DID
THAT
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
AGO
ITS
IN
THE
BIOS
AND
IF
SOFTWARE
HAD
TOLD
ME
THIS
ISNT
THE
MACHINE
YOU
INSTALLED
ME
ON
I
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
USED
THAT
SOFTWARE
AGAIN
REALLY
BAD
IDEA
I
DID
NOT
SAY
THAT
THE
ORIGINALS
WOULD
ALLOW
ONLY
ONE
INSTALL
THE
USERS
CONSCIENCE
SHOULD
DO
THAT
THIS
IS
SILLY
ITS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
LOAN
DISKS
TO
A
FRIEND
AND
LET
THEM
DO
AN
INSTALL
THAN
TO
BACKUP
YOUR
COPY
ALREADY
ON
DISK
AND
THEN
GIVE
THEM
THAT
YOUR
SCHEME
ISNT
GOING
TO
STOP
ANYONE
YOU
KNOW
HOW
MANY
BYTES
YOU
NEED
TO
CHANGE
IN
XWING
TO
DISABLE
THE
QUIZ
TWO
YES
TWO
AND
DONT
ASK
ME
WHICH
ONES
THEY
ARE
DO
YOU
KNOW
ANY
ASSEMBLY
LANGUAGE
AT
ALL
ALL
ANYONE
NEEDS
TO
DO
IF
FIND
THE
PART
OF
THE
CODE
THAT
DOES
THE
QUIZ
AND
INSERT
A
JMP
INSTRUCTION
TO
JUST
COMPLETELY
SKIP
IT
NOT
THAT
DIFFICULT
REALLY
AND
THERE
IS
VERY
LITTLE
THAT
COMMPANIES
CAN
DO
TO
STOP
THIS
TYPE
OF
THING
USING
PKLITE
OR
SOME
SIMILAR
UTILITY
WOULD
HELP
BUT
ONLY
IF
THE
RESULTING
COMPRESSED
EXE
WERE
TAGGED
AS
UNCOMPRESSABLE
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
THE
COMPANIES
SHOULD
DO
IS
IMPLEMENT
THE
ABOVE
PLUS
A
SPECIAL
PATCH
ONCE
THE
USER
REGISTERS
THAT
LOUDLY
EXCLAIMS
UPON
BOOTUP
REGISTERED
TO
XXXXX
ADDRESS
CITY
STATE
ZIP
AND
DISABLES
THE
ABOVE
THIS
IS
BY
FAR
THE
BEST
IDEA
YOU
PRESENTED
IN
YOUR
POST
MAKING
IT
PLAINLY
OBVIOUS
WHO
REGISTERED
IS
GOING
TO
STOP
CASUAL
PIRATES
BUT
THE
DETERMINED
ONES
ARE
JUST
GOING
TO
ANSWER
JOE
BLOW
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHATS
YOUR
NAME
SO
THIS
WONT
STOP
THEM
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
PIRATES
ARE
ALWAYS
GOING
TO
WIN
THIS
FIGHT
THEY
SIMPLY
HAVE
MORE
TIME
TO
WORK
ON
THE
SOFTWARE
AND
FIGURE
OUT
THE
PROTECTION
