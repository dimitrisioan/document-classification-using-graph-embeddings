this
is
almost
exactly
the
reason
i
keep
only
the
latest
databook
around
too
many
times
last
years
books
turn
into
three
years
ago
and
the
data
in
them
doesnt
match
the
current
production

but
if
you
are
in
the
habit
of
trying
to
repair
old
and
obsolete
machines
the
old
data
books
are
a
goldmine
of
information
you
can
not
get
anywhere
else
if
you
are
trying
to
find
a
modern
replacement
for
an
obsolete
part
the
original
specs
really
come
in
handy
design
out
of
the
new
books
but
save
the
old
ones
or
donate
them
to
a
ham
if
anybody
in
phoenix
disagrees
ill
drive
over
and
help
them
get
rid
of
all
their
old
data
books

data
books
and
growing
