RE
WHAT
DO
NUCLEAR
SITES
COOLING
TOWERS
DO
SWALKERUTSEDUAU
WROTE
I
REALLY
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
TO
POST
THIS
QUESTION
SO
I
FIGURED
THAT
THIS
BOARD
WOULD
BE
MOST
APPROPRIATE
I
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
THOSE
MASSIVE
CONCRETE
CYLINDERS
THAT
ARE
EVER
PRESENT
AT
NUCLEAR
POER
SITES
THEY
LOOK
LIKE
CYLINDERS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
PINCHED
IN
THE
MIDDLE
DOES
ANYBODY
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ACTUAL
PURPOSE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
ARE
I
HEAR
THAT
THEYRE
CALLED
COOLING
TOWERS
BUT
WHAT
THE
HECK
DO
THEY
COOL
I
HOPE
SOMEONE
CAN
HELP
DURING
THE
NUCLEAR
FISSION
REACTION
THE
URANIUM
FUEL
CAN
GET
HOT
ENOUGH
TO
MELT
WHEN
THIS
HAPPENS
THE
LIQUID
URANIUM
IS
PUMPED
TO
THE
COOLING
TOWER
WHERE
IT
IS
SPRAYED
INTO
THE
AIR
CONTACT
WITH
THE
COOL
OUTSIDE
AIR
WILL
CONDENSE
THE
MIST
AND
IT
WILL
FALL
BACK
TO
THE
COOLING
TOWER
FLOOR
THERE
IT
IS
COLLECTED
BY
A
CLEANING
CREW
USING
SHOP
VACS
AND
IS
THEN
REFORMED
INTO
PELLETS
FOR
REACTOR
USE
THE
NEXT
DAY
COOLING
TOWERS
ARE
A
LOT
TALLER
THAN
THEY
REALLY
NEED
TO
BE
POWER
COMPANIES
ARE
FORCED
TO
MAKE
THEM
THAT
TALL
BY
SOME
ENVIROMENTAL
LAW
THAT
REQUIRES
THE
RAW
URANIUM
EMISIONS
TO
BE
HELD
TO
UNDER
THIS
LAW
IS
NOW
UNDER
ATTACK
BY
LAWYERS
ARGUING
THAT
THE
SHOULD
BE
MEASURED
AT
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
PROPERTY
RATHER
THAN
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
COOLING
TOWER
ELIMINATING
THIS
LAW
WILL
SAVE
POWER
COMPANIES
THOUSANDS
OF
DOLLARS
IN
CONCRETE
COSTS
FOR
NEW
NUKES
