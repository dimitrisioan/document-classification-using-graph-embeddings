WRITES
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
ELECTRONICS
SOLDER
WITH
A
SILVER
CONTENT
THAT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
GOOD
WETTING
AND
FATIQUE
REATINGS
CAN
ANYONE
TELL
ME
WHY
IT
IS
NOT
USED
SILVER
IS
NOT
SUCH
AN
EXPENSIVE
METAL
FROM
MANAGEMENT
OF
ELECTRONICS
ASSEMBLY
IAN
OAKES
AFTER
TALKING
ABOUT
TIN
LEAD
ALLOY
AND
THE
EUTECTIC
POINT
OCCASIONALLY
IMPURITIES
MAY
BE
ADDED
TO
SOLDER
TO
VARY
CHARACTERSITICS
WITHIN
THE
SOLDERING
PROCESS
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
IMPROVE
PERFORMANCE
FOR
EXAMPLE
ADDITION
OF
SMALL
QUANTITIES
OF
ANTIMONY
AND
COPPER
CAN
REDUCE
THE
AMOUNT
SOLDER
MOVES
UNDER
STRESS
WHEN
SOLID
FOR
PARTICULAR
APPLICATIONS
ADDITIONS
OF
IMPURITIES
MAY
BE
WARRANTED
BUT
IN
GENERAL
IT
IS
BEST
TO
KEEP
THE
SOLDER
USED
IN
A
SOLDERING
PROCESS
AS
PURE
AS
POSSIBLE
I
GUESS
THIS
IS
THE
GOOD
OIL
FOR
COMMERCIAL
OPERATIONS
BUT
IT
DOESNT
MENTION
ANYTHING
ESOTERIC
LEON
