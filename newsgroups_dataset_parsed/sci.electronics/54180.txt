I
NEED
A
SMALL
BATTERY
POWERED
HI
VOLTAGE
CAPACITIVE
DISCHARGE
SUPPLY
TO
DELIVER
JOULES
AT
VOLTS
THE
UBIQUITOUS
CAMERA
FLASH
CIRCUIT
IS
WHAT
I
WANT
BUT
I
CANT
GET
MINE
APART
WITHOUT
BREAKING
IT
CHARLIE
BRETTS
SUGGESTION
BUY
ONE
OF
THE
DISPOSABLE
FLASH
CAMERAS
USE
THE
FILM
THEN
TAKE
THE
THING
APART
IS
A
GOOD
ONE
NOTE
THOUGH
THAT
YOU
WONT
GET
A
PARTICULARLY
PRECISE
VOLTAGE
OUT
OF
SUCH
A
THING
AND
IT
MAY
BE
A
SINGLEPOINT
DESIGN
THAT
WONT
ADAPT
WELL
TO
OFFNOMINAL
OPERATION
THE
THINGS
ARE
EASY
TO
DISMANTLE
THE
KEY
PIECE
OF
INFORMATION
IS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
ADVANCE
THE
FILM
ON
ONE
OF
THEM
YOU
ARE
WINDING
IT
INTO
THE
FILM
CASSETTE
IT
IS
UNWOUND
FROM
THE
CASSETTE
IN
THE
FACTORY
WHEN
THE
CAMERA
IS
MADE
SO
NO
DARKROOM
IS
NEEDED
FOR
DISMANTLING
ITS
STANDARD
FILM
SO
JUST
TAKE
THE
CASSETTE
IN
FOR
PROCESSING
ALL
THE
CAMERASTORE
PEOPLE
DO
WHEN
YOU
BRING
IN
ONE
OF
THE
DISPOSABLES
IS
RIP
IT
APART
TOSS
THE
FILM
CASSETTE
INTO
THE
TOBEPROCESSED
BIN
AND
THROW
THE
BATTERY
IN
ONE
TRASHCAN
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
CAMERA
IN
ANOTHER
IF
YOU
TAKE
IT
APART
YOURSELF
YOU
GET
AN
AA
ALKALINE
BATTERY
STILL
WITH
A
FAIR
BIT
OF
LIFE
IN
IT
AND
ALL
KINDS
OF
LITTLE
BITS
AND
PIECES
FROM
THE
CAMERA
I
EXPECT
YOU
COULD
EVEN
RELOAD
AND
REUSE
THE
CAMERA
IF
YOU
WERE
REALLY
DETERMINED
RESEMBLES
A
HIGHSPEED
COLLISION
