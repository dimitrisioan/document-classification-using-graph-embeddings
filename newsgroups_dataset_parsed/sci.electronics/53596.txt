RE
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
SO
HERES
MY
QUESTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ID
HAVE
THE
SAME
ELECTRICAL
CIRCUIT
IF
I
HOOKED
THE
NEUTRAL
JUMPER
FROM
THE
NEUTRAL
OVER
TO
THE
GROUND
SCREW
ON
NEW
THREE
PRONG
GROUNDING
OUTLETS
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
MY
REASONING
HERE
FIRST
GO
TO
THE
LOCAL
HARDWARE
STORE
AND
PICK
UP
A
COPY
OF
WIRING
SIMPLIFIED
BY
HL
RICHTER
NOW
IF
YOUR
HOUSE
IS
WIRED
WITH
METAL
CONDUIT
YOU
DONT
NEED
A
SEPERATE
GROUND
WIRE
ASSUMING
THE
HOUSE
IS
WIRED
CORRECTLY
AND
THE
PIPES
ARE
CONNECTED
TO
A
COLD
WATER
PIPE
IN
YOUR
BASEMENT
THE
OUTLETS
THAT
HAVE
A
NEUTRAL
HOOKED
TO
THE
GROUND
SCREW
SEEM
WRONG
ANYONE
ELSE
THINK
SO
BACK
IN
THE
I
WAS
A
SERVICE
TECHNICIAN
FOR
A
CASH
REGISTER
COMPANY
THE
CASH
REGISTERS
USED
MICROPROCESSOR
CIRCUITS
AND
BACK
THEN
THEY
WERE
VERY
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ELECTROSTATIC
DISCHARGE
AND
LINE
NOISE
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEMS
CAME
FROM
OUTLETS
THAT
WERE
NOT
PROPERLY
GROUNDED
IN
ALMOST
EVERY
PLACE
WE
WENT
TO
DO
AN
INSTALLATION
WE
FOUND
OUTLETS
WITH
THE
GROUND
CONNECTED
TO
THE
NEUTRAL
FOR
OF
THE
THINGS
YOU
CAN
PLUG
INTO
ONE
OF
THESE
THEY
WORK
FINE
FOR
OUR
CASH
REGISTERS
THEY
WERE
A
NIGHTMARE
LINE
NOISE
TENDED
TO
SCRAMBLE
THE
MEMORY
PERIODICALLY
WITH
MODERN
ELECTRONICS
USING
SWITCHING
POWER
SUPPLIES
THIS
SHOULD
BE
LESS
OF
A
PROBLEM
EVEN
THE
COMPANY
I
USED
TO
WORK
FOR
IS
NO
LONGER
RECOMMENDING
A
DEDICATED
LINE
WITH
A
SEPERATE
GROUND
FOR
THEIR
EQUIPMENT
I
IMAGINE
IF
YOU
CHECK
MOST
HOUSEHOLD
WIRING
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
THE
GROUND
AND
NEUTRAL
ARE
CONNECTED
ALTHOUGH
NOT
IDEAL
IT
SHOULD
BE
OK
FOR
MOST
APPLICATIONS
