write
a
good
manual
to
go
with
the
software
the
hassle
of
photocopying
the
manual
is
offset
by
simplicity
of
purchasing
the
package
for
only
also
consider
offering
an
inexpensive
but
attractive
perc
for
registered
users
for
instance
a
coffee
mug
you
could
produce
and
mail
the
incentive
for
a
couple
of
dollars
so
consider
pricing
the
product
at
or
documentation
for
the
program
a
lot
of
shareware
out
there
is
very
similar
in
the
approach
send
in
your
money
and
you
get
documentation
and
a
free
upgrade
to
the
latest
version
perhaps
even
support
of
some
small
degree
whatever
you
want
to
offer
that
is
better
than
the
circulating
version
youre
lucky
if
only
of
the
instances
of
your
program
in
use
are
nonlicensed
users
figure
about
as
i
have
seen
the
best
approach
is
to
estimate
your
loss
and
accomodate
that
into
your
price
structure
sure
it
hurts
legitimate
users
but
too
bad
it
doesnt
really
hurt
legit
users
shareware
is
still
much
cheaper
than
the
alternatives
