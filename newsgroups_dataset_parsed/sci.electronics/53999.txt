flexible
solar
cells
two
or
three
years
ago
i
saw
a
report
on
tv
about
a
company
that
had
developed
a
method
of
making
solar
cells
on
a
flexible
substrate
my
failing
memory
has
convinced
me
it
was
some
flexible
metal
i
now
have
an
application
that
requires
a
flexible
solar
cell
and
was
hoping
someone
out
in
netland
knows
something
about
this
company
or
a
similar
product
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
