re
hi
volt
from
battery
you
might
want
to
get
a
disposible
flash
camera
shoot
the
roll
of
film
then
take
it
apart
theyre
snapped
together
we
used
a
bunch
of
them
at
my
wedding
but
instead
of
sending
the
whole
camera
in
i
just
took
the
film
out
its
a
standard
canister
and
kept
the
batteries
they
use
one
aa
battery
sorry
i
didnt
keep
any
of
the
flash
electronics
