I
REALLY
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
TO
POST
THIS
QUESTION
SO
I
FIGURED
THAT
THIS
BOARD
WOULD
BE
MOST
APPROPRIATE
I
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
THOSE
MASSIVE
CONCRETE
CYLINDERS
THAT
ARE
EVER
PRESENT
AT
NUCLEAR
POER
SITES
THEY
LOOK
LIKE
CYLINDERS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
PINCHED
IN
THE
MIDDLE
DOES
ANYBODY
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ACTUAL
PURPOSE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
ARE
I
HEAR
THAT
THEYRE
CALLED
COOLING
TOWERS
BUT
WHAT
THE
HECK
DO
THEY
COOL
EXCEPT
FOR
THEIR
SIZE
THE
COOLING
TOWERS
ON
NUCLEAR
POWER
PLANTS
ARE
VERTUALLY
IDENTICAL
IN
CONSTRUCTION
AND
OPERATION
TO
COOLING
TOWERS
DESIGNED
AND
BUILT
IN
THE
A
HUNDRED
YEARS
AGO
FOR
COAL
FIRED
POWER
PLANTS
USED
FOR
LIGHTING
AND
EARLY
ELECTRIC
RAILWAYS
BASICLY
THE
CYLINDRICAL
TOWER
SUPPORTS
A
RAPID
AIR
DRAFT
WHEN
ITS
AIR
IS
HEATED
BY
HOT
WATER
ANDOR
STEAM
CIRCULATING
THRU
A
NETWORK
OF
PIPES
THAT
FILL
ABOUT
THE
LOWER
OF
THE
TOWER
TO
ASSIST
COOLING
AND
THE
DRAFT
WATER
MISTERS
ARE
ADDED
THAT
SPRAY
COLD
WATER
OVER
THE
HOT
PIPES
THE
COLD
WATER
EVAPORATES
REMOVING
THE
HEAT
FASTER
THAN
JUST
AIR
FLOW
FROM
THE
DRAFT
WOULD
AND
THE
RESULTING
WATER
VAPOR
IS
RAPIDLY
CARRIED
AWAY
BY
THE
DRAFT
THIS
PRODUCES
THE
CLOUDS
FREQUENTLY
SEEN
RISING
OUT
OF
THESE
TOWERS
THAT
SLIGHT
PINCH
MAYBE
OF
THE
WAY
UP
THE
TOWER
IS
THERE
BECAUSE
IT
PRODUCES
A
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE
IN
THE
STRENGTH
AND
RATE
OF
THE
AIR
DRAFT
PRODUCED
COMPARED
TO
A
STRAIGHT
CYLINDER
SHAPE
THE
TOWERS
ARE
USED
TO
RECONDENSE
THE
STEAM
IN
THE
SEALED
STEAM
SYSTEM
OF
THE
POWER
PLANT
SO
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
RECIRCULATED
BACK
TO
THE
BOILER
AND
USED
AGAIN
THE
WIDER
THE
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENCE
ACROSS
THE
TURBINES
USED
IN
THE
POWER
PLANT
THE
MORE
EFFECIENT
THEY
ARE
AND
BY
RECONDENSING
THE
STEAM
IN
THE
COOLING
TOWERS
BEFORE
SENDING
IT
BACK
TO
THE
BOILERS
YOU
MAINTAIN
A
VERY
WIDE
TEMPERATURE
DIFFERENCE
SOMETIMES
AS
HIGH
AS
DEGREES
OR
MORE
FROM
FIRST
STAGE
HOT
TURBINE
TO

GREAT
EXPLAINATION
HOWEVER
YOU
LEFT
OFF
ONE
DETAIL
WHY
DO
YOU
ALWAYS
SEE
THEM
AT
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
AT
FOSSIL
FUEL
PLANTS
AT
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
IT
IS
PREFERED
TO
RUN
THE
WATER
CLOSED
CYCLE
WHEREAS
FOSSIL
FUEL
PLANTS
CAN
IN
SOME
CASES
GET
AWAY
WITH
DUMPING
THE
HOT
WATER
AS
I
RECALL
THE
WATER
ISNT
AS
HOT
THERMODYNAMICALLY
IN
MANY
FOSSIL

PLANTS
AND
OF

THERE
IS
LESS
DANGER
OF
