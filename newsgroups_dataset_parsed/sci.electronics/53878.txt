i
have
written
a
program
and
i
want
to
market
it
i
would
like
certain
degree
of
protection
since
my
main
custmers
are
individuals
and
not
the
cooperations
i
know
laser
hole
burning
method
and
hardware
key
method
however
my
software
is
going
to
cost
only
so
i
can
not
afford
that
also
at
this
low
price
i
can
not
afford
people
make
too
many
copy
of
my
software
well
i
guess
say
upto
illigal
copying
is
ok
by
me
however
i
do
not
want
someone
to
get
a
copy
of
pctools
and
copy
my
software
off
course
i
never
meant
to
forbid
the
true
hackers
from
copying
since
they
can
develope
a
better
program
anyway
i
wouldnt
bother
with
the
copy
protection
if
i
were
you
if
you
program
is
any
good
the
pirates
will
have
stripped
the
protection
and
will
be
distributing
the
stripped
version
is
well
under
a
week
hardware
methods
prevent
j
random
loser
from
using
his
copy
ii
pc
to
pirate
your
software
but
doesnt
stop
anyone
who
knows
a
few
people
with
enough
connections
to
real
pirates
who
will
be
able
to
defeat
your
check
for
the
hole
code
you
may
want
to
price
your
software
depending
on
what
it
is
a
tad
higher
a
price
change
from
to
probably
would
turn
off
very
few
potentials
buyers
and
that
way
you
could
tolerate
more
pirates
whose
numbers
dont
change
with
the
price
as
for
the
pirating
figure
ha
ha
of
course
a
lot
of
pirates
just
have
this
thing
about
having
pirated
software
even
if
they
never
use
it
so
perhaps
that
really
wouldnt
count
towards
even
so
is
awfully
low

ps
i
assume
youre
talking
pc
software
if
youre
talking
unix
or
something
else
somewhat
obscure
copy
protection
might
be
a
slightly
more
viable
alternative
