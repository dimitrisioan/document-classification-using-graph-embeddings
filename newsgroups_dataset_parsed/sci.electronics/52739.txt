IS
IT
JUST
ME
OR
DOES
ANYBODY
ELSE
OUT
THERE
NOT
LIKE
DIGITAL
SCOPES
MY
SCHOOL
HAS
DAVID
JACOBOWITZ
OH
NO
YOURE
NOT
THE
ONLY
ONE
ANALOGUE
SCOPES
GIVE
YOU
OR
ME
AT
LEAST
A
FAIR
IDEA
OF
WHATS
GOING
ON
IN
A
CIRCUIT
DIGITAL
SCOPES
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
HABIT
OF
INVENTING
A
SIZABLE
PART
OF
IT
EG
EVEN
WHEN
THERE
ARE
ONLY
A
FEW
SAMPLES
PER
PERIOD
OUR
DISPLAYS
A
CONTINUOUS
WAVEFORM
COMPLETE
WITH
NONEXISTING
OVERSHOOTS
IVE
WADED
THROUGH
LOTS
OF
MANUAL
PAGES
AND
MENUS
BUT
I
HAVENT
FOUND
YET
HOW
TO
TURN
THIS
OFF
IT
DOESNT
SHOW
WHICH
POINTS
HAVE
ACTUALLY
BEEN
MEASURED
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THOSE
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
INTERPOLATED
EITHER
PERHAPS
YOURE
USING
THE
WRONG
BRAND
SORRY
ALL
HP
FANS
BUT
I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
BEING
CONVINCED
THAT
THEIR
SCOPES
MATCH
THE
REST
OF
THEIR
EXCELLENT
GEAR
ONE
OF
THE
PRINCIPAL
FUNCTIONS
I
LOOK
FOR
WHEN
CONSIDERING
A
DSO
IS
WHETHER
YOU
CAN
TURN
INTERPOLATION
OFF
THE
OTHER
IMPORTANT
FEATURE
IS
TO
DISABLE
REPETITIVE
WAVEFORM
ACQUISITION
IE
BEING
ABLE
TO
LOCK
THE
INSTRUMENT
INTO
REAL
TIME
CAPTURE
MODE
SECONDLY
I
DONT
LIKE
MENUS
I
WANT
TO
SEE
ALL
COMMON
FUNCTIONS
WITH
THEIR
OWN
BUTTON
YOULL
HAVE
GUESSED
I
LOVE
ANALOGUE
TEK
SCOPES
ID
CHOOSE
A
KNOB
WITH
PRINTED
LEGEND
OVER
AN
ONSCREEN
DISPLAY
WITH
UPDOWN
BUTTONS
RIGHT
AWAY
THE
SINGLE
KNOB
OF
MOST
DIGITAL
INSTRUMENTS
NEVER
SEEMS
TO
BE
CONNECTED
TO
THE
RIGHT
FUNCTION
AT
THE
RIGHT
MOMENT
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
THE
ONLY
CONSOLATION
IS
THAT
MANUFACTURERS
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
ERGONOMICS
WHEN
DESIGNING
THE
MENUS
HOWEVER
TO
BE
FAIR
IT
SEEMS
THAT
FIRST
TIME
SCOPE
USERS
OUR
STUDENTS
SEEM
TO
ADJUST
TO
MENUS
EASIER
THAN
NAVIGATING
AROUND
THE
TWENTY
OR
MORE
KNOBS
REQUIRED
OF
A
REAL
SCOPE
LAST
BUT
NOT
LEAST
YOU
NEVER
KNOW
IF
THE
WAVEFORM
DISPLAYED
IS
OLD
OR
RECENT
NOISY
OR
JUST
INCOHERENTLY
MODULATED
HECK
YOU
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
IF
IT
REALLY
LOOKS
THE
WAY
ITS
DISPLAYED
DIGITAL
SCOPES
ONLY
SHOW
YOU
A
TINY
FRACTION
OF
WHATS
GOING
ON
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THERE
BUSY
COMPUTING
THINGS
THIS
IS
ONE
AREA
THAT
NEWER
DSOS
ARE
ADDRESSING
I
RECENTLY
EVALUATED
THE
LATEST
BOX
FROM
TEK
THEIR
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
WORTHY
ALTERNATIVE
TO
A
STANDARD
ANALOGUE
CRO
THIS
INSTRUMENT
HAS
A
SPEC
MEANING
THAT
IT
IS
ALWAYS
IN
REAL
TIME
CAPTURE
MODE
THE
PRICING
ALSO
MATCHES
EQUIVALENT
ANALOGUE
SCOPES
IN
THE
RANGE
THE
DOWNER
IS
THAT
THE
INSTRUMENT
USES
MENUS
AGAIN
BUT
AT
LEAST
THEY
APPEAR
TO
BE
LOGICALLY
LAID
OUT
THERE
ARE
ONLY
THREE
SITUATIONS
FOR
WHICH
I
WOULD
PREFER
A
DIGITAL
SCOPE
LOOKING
AT
WHAT
HAPPENED
BEFORE
THE
TRIGGER
LOOKING
AT
RARE
EVENTS
AND
ACQUIRING
THE
DATA
TO
HAVE
MY
COMPUTER
PLAY
WITH
IT
LETS
HOPE
SCOPE
MANUFACTURERS
ARE
LISTENING
BEST

ONE
MORE
THING
ABOUT
THE
NEW
SIMPLER
FRONT
PANELS
THESE
INSTRUMENTS
TEND
TO
USE
DIGITAL
ROTARY
ENCODERS
AS
KNOBS
NOW
THIS
IS
A
VAST
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THE
OLD
OAK
SWITCH
THE
SINGLE
MOST
COMMON
CAUSE
OF
FAILURE
IN
OUR
SCOPES
OTHER
THAN
STUDENTS
BLOWING
UP
INPUTS
IS
MECHANICAL
WEAR
ON
THESE
SWITCHES
I
LOOK
AT
THE
NEW
PANELS
AS
A
GREAT
STEP
TOWARD
INCREASING
THE
LONGEVITY

THE
