IM
CONSIDERING
MODERNIZING
SOME
OLD
WIRING
IN
MY
HOME
AND
I
NEED
A
LITTLE
ADVICE
ON

WIRING
SEVERAL

THE
OLD
TWO
PRONG
TYPE
WITHOUT

NATURALLY
THE

FEEDING

OUTLETS
IS
WITHOUT
THE
GROUND
WIRE
I
NOTICED
AT
THE
FUSEBOX
THAT
SOME
CIRCUITS
HAVE
THE
WITH
GROUND
AND
THAT
ON
THESE
CIRCUITS
THE
GROUND
WIRE
WAS
TIED
TO
THE
SAME
BUS
AS
THE
NEUTRAL
WHITE
WIRE
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
CONNECTED
TOGETHER
AT
THE
BREAKER
PANEL
BUT
NOWHERE
REPEAT
NOWHERE
ELSE

ALMOST
THERE
ARE
STRANGE
EXCEPTIONS
FOR

THE
ONLY
PLACE
THE
NEUTRAL

BE
CONNECTED
TO
THE
GROUND
IS
IN
A

DISCONNECT
IN
YOUR
HOUSE
THE
MAIN

SERVES
AS
THE
SERVICE
DISCONNECT
SUB
PANLES
IN
YOUR
GARAGE
OR
WORKSHOP
FOR
EXAMPLE
MUST
MAINTAIN
SEPERATE
NEUTRAL
