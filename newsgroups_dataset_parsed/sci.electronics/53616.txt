im
considering
modernizing
some
old
wiring
in
my
home
and
i
need
a
little
advice
on
outlet
wiring
several
outlets
are
the
old
two
prong
type
without
the
ground
naturally
the
wire
feeding
these
outlets
is
without
the
ground
wire
i
noticed
at
the
fusebox
that
some
circuits
have
the
with
ground
and
that
on
these
circuits
the
ground
wire
was
tied
to
the
same
bus
as
the
neutral
white
wire
they
are
supposed
to
be
connected
together
at
the
breaker
panel
but
nowhere
repeat
nowhere
else
well
almost
there
are
strange
exceptions
for
things
like
subpanels

cis
not
even
in
sub
panels
the
only
place
the
neutral
should
be
connected
to
the
ground
is
in
a
service
disconnect
in
your
house
the
main
panel
serves
as
the
service
disconnect
sub
panles
in
your
garage
or
workshop
for
example
must
maintain
seperate
neutral
and
ground
busses
because
they
are
not
service
disconnect
equipment
