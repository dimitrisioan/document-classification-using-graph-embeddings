hi
i
was
doing
research
on
subliminal
suggestion
for
a
psychology
paper
and
i
read
that
one
researcher
flashed
hidden
messages
on
the
tv
screen
at
of
a
second
is
that
possible
i
thought
the
take
a
look
over
in
altfolkloreurban
there
is
a
thread
about
subliminal
messages
on
tv
the
fact
that
subliminal
messages
dont
work
aside
an
image
cant
be
flashed
on
a
tv
screen
fast
enough
to
not
be
noticed
