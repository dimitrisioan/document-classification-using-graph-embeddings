RE
DAYTON
HAMFEST
I
BOOKED
A
HOTEL
RED
ROOF
INN
LAST
WEEK
IN
CINCINNATI
BLUE
ASH
WHICH
IS
AT
THE
NORTHERN
TIP
OF
THE
METRO
CINCY
AREA
I
CHOSE
IT
FOR
A
FEW
REASONS
ALL
HOTELS
IN
AND
NEAR
DAYTON
WERE
BOOKED
SOLID
THIS
HOTEL
IS
ONLY
COSTING
IT
WAS
ONE
OF
ABOUT
ROOMS
LEFT
ON
THE
NIGHT
I
RESERVED
CINCINNATI
PROBABLY
HAS
MORE
TO
TO
AT
NIGHT
THAN
DAYTON
I
INTEND
TO
HIT
THE
RIVERBOAT
ENTERTAINMENT
AT
DUSK
IF
ANYONE
HAS
OTHER
SUGGESTIONS
FOR
NIGHTLIFE
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
OF
OTHER
HOT
SPOTS
THANKS
