LIGHTING
AND
QUESTIONS
CAN
LOW
VOLTAGE
LIGHTS
BE
CONTROLLED
WITH
AN
MODULE
BY
PUTTING
IT
BEFORE
THE
TRANSFORMER
IT
SEEMS
TO
WORK
EVEN
THE
DIMMER
WORKS
NOT
VERY
RELIABLE
WILL
IT
DAMAGE
THE

CAN
IT
BE
DONE
RELIABLY
I
PUT
A
MOTION
SWITCH
HEATH
TO
A
LOW
VOLTAGE
LIGHT

WORKED
BUT

CAN
I
GET
ARROUND
THAT
HOW
CAN
I
INCREASE
THE
INTENSITY
OF
A
LIGHT
USING
THE
PC
COMPUTER
INTERFACE
WITHOUT
HAVING
IT
GO
ON
FIRST
AND
THEN
DOWN
I
AM
DOING
MY
