re
exploding
tv
just
a
thoughtmaybe
it
possibly
has
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
is
an
emerson
ive
got
an
emerson
vcr
which
is
in
the
series
returned
it
six
times
for
various
and
never
the
same
problems
got
tired
of
taking
it
back
and
fixed
it
myself
the
hifi
window
was
a
bit
off
something
like
the
hifi
audio
finetuning
when
i
was
a
walmart
associate
in
we
had
at
least
one
returned
as
defective
every
single
day
hows
that
for
reliability
face
itemerson
can
make
audio
stuff
albeit
not
of
premium
quality
but
they
cant
make
anything
as
complex
as
video
equipment
with
reliability
imho
please
no
flames
just
had
to
share
my
emerson
disaster
in
the
light
of
this
exploding
tv
