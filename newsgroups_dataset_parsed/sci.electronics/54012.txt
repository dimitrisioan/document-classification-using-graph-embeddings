can
radio
freq
be

im
wondering
if
its
possible
to
use
radio
waves
to
measure
the
distance
between
a
transmitters
and
receiver
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
measure
the
signal
strength
and
determine
distance
this
would
be
for
short
distances
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuracy
of
inches
or
so
you
might
try
looking
at
whats
available
in
laser
locating
systems
they
work
best
for
close
work
mile
and
under
rf
is
used
for
much
longer
distances
in
two
major
modes
transponder
and
phase
measurment
transponder
requires
you
send
a
pulse
to
another
station
and
it
returns
it
to
you
and
you
measure
the
round
trip
time
minus
the
receiver
time
phase
measurements
require
two
or
more
transmitting
stations
sending
the
same
frequency
signal
multiplexed
in
time
a
receiver
can
pick
them
up
and
measure
the
phase
shift
between
signals
maps
can
be
drawn
that
plot
the
lines
of
position
that
correspond
to
a
certain
phase
shift
between
two
stations
