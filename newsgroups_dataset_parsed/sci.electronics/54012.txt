IF
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
USE
RADIO
WAVES
TO
MEASURE
THE
DISTANCE
BETWEEN
A
TRANSMITTERS
AND
RECEIVER
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
MEASURE
THE
SIGNAL
STRENGTH
AND
DETERMINE
DISTANCE
THIS
WOULD
BE
FOR
SHORT
DISTANCES
FT
AND
I
WOULD
NEED
TO
HAVE
ACCURACY
OF
INCHES

SO
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
LOOKING

WHATS

IS

MEASURMENT
TRANSPONDER
REQUIRES
YOU
SEND
A
PULSE
TO
ANOTHER
STATION
AND
IT
RETURNS
IT
TO
YOU
AND
YOU
MEASURE
THE
