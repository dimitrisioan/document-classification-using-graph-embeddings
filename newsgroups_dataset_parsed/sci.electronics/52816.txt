seeking
thermocouple
amplifier
circuit
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
amplify
a
voltage
signal
which
is
output
from
a
thermocouple
preferably
by
a
factor
of
or
so
that
the
resulting
voltage
can
be
fed
more
easily
into
a
personalcomputerbased
adc
data
acquisition
card
might
anyone
be
able
to
point
me
to
references
to
such
circuits
i
have
seen
simple
amplifier
circuits
before
but
i
am
not
sure
how
well
they
work
in
practice
in
this
case
id
like
something
which
will
amplify
sufficiently
nicely
to
be
used
for
thermocouples
say
a
few
degrees
accuracy
or
better
any
pointers
would
be
greatly
appreciated
