SEEKING
THERMOCOUPLE
AMPLIFIER
CIRCUIT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
AMPLIFY
A
VOLTAGE
SIGNAL
WHICH
IS
OUTPUT
FROM
A
THERMOCOUPLE
PREFERABLY
BY
A
FACTOR
OF
OR
SO
THAT
THE
RESULTING
VOLTAGE
CAN
BE
FED
MORE
EASILY
INTO
A
PERSONALCOMPUTERBASED
ADC
DATA
ACQUISITION
CARD
MIGHT
ANYONE
BE
ABLE
TO
POINT
ME
TO
REFERENCES
TO
SUCH
CIRCUITS
I
HAVE
SEEN
SIMPLE
AMPLIFIER
CIRCUITS
BEFORE
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
WELL
THEY
WORK
IN
PRACTICE
IN
THIS
CASE
ID
LIKE
SOMETHING
WHICH
WILL
AMPLIFY
SUFFICIENTLY
NICELY
TO
BE
USED
FOR
THERMOCOUPLES
SAY
A
FEW
DEGREES
ACCURACY
OR
BETTER
ANY
POINTERS
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
