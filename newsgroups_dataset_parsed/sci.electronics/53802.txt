PWM
CONTROL
THRU
SOFTWARE
CURRENTLY
I
AM
USING
THE
MICROCONTROLLER
WITH
EXTERNAL
EPROM
IN
ORDER
TO
DRIVE
THE
DC
MOTOR
WITH
DIRECTION
I
USE
THE
PULSE
WIDTH
MODULTION
THRU
SOFTWARE
CONTROLASSEMBLY
LANGUAGE
PROGRAMMING
HOWEVER
I
AM
AFRAID
THAT
THEY
WILL
BE
OVERHEADS
AND
THUS
ALTER
THE
PULSE
TIMING
MY
QUESTION
IS
IS
THE
SOFTWARE
PWM
CONTROL
RELIABLE
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
PORT
IS
A
LATCH
AND
SO
I
VARY
THE
DUTY
CYCLE
BY
SETTING
IT
HIGH
FIRST
AND
AT
THE
DESIRE
DUTY
CYCLE
THEN
I
SET
LOW
ANY
IMPROMENTS
