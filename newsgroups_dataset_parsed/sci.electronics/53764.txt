COMMONMODE
NOISE
AND
SMALL
SIGNALS
I
HAVE
NEVER
WORKED
WITH
REALLY
SMALL
SIGNALS
BEFORE
AND
HAVE
A
FEW
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
LOW
LEVEL
NOISE
I
HAVE
NOTICED
THAT
THE
WAVEFORM
SYNTHESIZER
THAT
I
AM
USING
ANALOGIC
HAS
SOME
RELATIVELY
LARGE
COMMON
MODE
NOISE
ON
IT
I
AM
USING
THIS
SYNTHESIZER
TO
NULL
OUT
ANOTHER
TRANSIENT
WAVEFORM
AND
AM
AMPLIFYING
THE
DIFFERENCE
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
TIMES
THE
HAS
ABOUT
MVPP
OF
COMMON
MODE
NOISE
AND
THIS
TENDS
TO
MAKE
MY
MEASUREMENTS
HARD
TO
REPEAT
THE
NOISE
IS
NOT
QUITE
IN
SYNC
WITH
LINE
FREQUENCY
AND
ON
A
SPECTRUM
ANALYZER
THE
MAIN
COMPONENT
IS
ABOUT
HOW
CAN
I
GET
RID
OF
THE
NOISE
WHEN
I
LOOK
AT
THE
SPECTRUM
USING
AN
HP
AUDIO
RANGE
ANALYZER
THE
NOISE
GOES
AWAY
THE
MINUTE
I
SWITCH
TO
ISOLATION
ON
THE
INPUT
I
AM
GUESSING
THE
ANLAYZER
HAS
A
DIFF
AMP
ON
THE
INPUT
SINCE
IT
WILL
READ
ACCURATELY
DOWN
TO
DC
ALSO
IF
I
USE
A
DIFFERENTIAL
AMPLIFIER
IA
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
HOW
IMPORTANT
IS
IT
TO
USE
ONE
OF
THESE
SHIELD
DRIVERS
AN
AMP
CONNECTED
TO
THE
SHIELD
IN
SORT
OF
A
FEEDBACK
LOOP
TO
REMOVE
TROUBLE
CAUSED
BY
DIFFERENT
CABLE
CAPACITANCES
IF
ANYONE
CAN
SUGGEST
A
GOOD
IC
IA
FOR
USE
WITH
TRANSIENT
SIGNALS
WITH
CONTENT
FROM
TO
ABOUT
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
IT
