about
data
io
device
proggers
i
keep
finding
these
programmers
in
local
junk
shops
this
may
mean
that
they
are
indeed
junk
but
id
like
to
hear
from
anyone
else
that
may
have
met
up

basic
device
is
a
data
io
universal
programmer
and

usual
pod
is
a
logicpak

a
programming
tester
adapter
id
really
like
to
hear
from
anyone
who
knows
whether
these
monsters
are
worth
bothering
with

want
to
do
is
