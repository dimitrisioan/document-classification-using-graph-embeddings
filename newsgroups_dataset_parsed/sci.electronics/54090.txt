WHAT
I
BELIEVE
THE
COMPANIES
SHOULD
DO
IS
IMPLEMENT
THE
ABOVE
PLUS
A
SPECIAL
PATCH
ONCE
THE
USER
REGISTERS
THAT
LOUDLY
EXCLAIMS
UPON
BOOTUP
REGISTERED
TO
XXXXX
ADDRESS
CITY
STATE
ZIP
AND
DISABLES
THE
ABOVE
TWO
BENEFITS
ENCOURAGES
REGISTRATION
CUTS
DOWN
ON
PIRATING
AND
MAKES
IT
MORE
TRACEABLE
BECAUSE
IF
THE
PATCHS
REGISTRATION
MESSAGE
IS
ENCRYPTED
IT
WILL
BE
QUITE
HARD
TO
CHANGE
AND
THEREFORE
PROVIDES
A
STABLE
TRAIL
OF
WHO
ALLOWED
THEIR
COPY
OUT
OF
THEIR
HANDS
AND
THUS
VIOLATED
THEIR
LICENSE
AGREEMENT
YOU
TAKE
TWO
COPIES
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
REGISTRATION
ID
COMPARE
THEM
BYTE
FOR
BYTE
AND
YOU
KNOW
WHERE
THEY
ARE
LOCATED
USUALLY
YOU
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
IS
WHAT
AFTER
THAT
PROBABLY
BUT
THE
POINT
IS
THE
COMPANY
MAKE
THE
REGISTRATION
PATCH
NOT
YOU
SURE
YOU
CAN
PROBABLY
FIND
ANOTHER
REGISTERRED
USER
AND
COMPARE
NOTES
BUT
WHY
ITS
NOT
HINDERING
YOU
IN
ANY
WAY
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
JUST
HACKING
PROBLEM
ABOUT
PEOPLE
WHO
CUT
TOO
MUCH
FROM
QUOTING
AND
WHAT
KEEPS
ME
FORM
REGISTERING
AS
JOHN
DOE
FROM
THE
COMPANY
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
YELLOW
BRICK
ROAD
TINSELTOWN
OR
SOMETHING
NOTHING
BUT
IF
YOU
READ
MY
WHOLE
SUGGESTION
IM
SAYING
THAT
YOU
REGISTER
VIA
MAIL
BY
MAILING
IN
YOUR
REGISTRATION
CARD
THEN
THE
COMPANY
SEND
YOU
THE
PATCH
WHICH
INCLUDES
THE
INFO
YOU
PUT
ON
THE
REGISTRATION
CARD
