if
you
know
much
about
pcs
ibm
comp
you
might
try
the
joystick
port
though
i
havent
tried
this
myself
ive
been
told
that
the
port
has
built
in
ad
converters
this
would
allow
the
joystick
to
be
a
couple
of
pots
if
you
could
find
the
specs
this
might
just
work
for
you
i
guess
connecting
pins
and
or
get
an
daconverter
merely
a
couple
of
transistors
and
resistors
and
an
opamp
to
compare
its
output
to
the
voltage
you
want
to
measure
connect
them
to
a
spared
printer
port
if
you
have
one
and
do
the
rest
by
software
stepwise
refinement
the
port
addresses
for
your
printer
ports
are
probably
this
should
work
well
enough
for
your
purposes
hope
this
helps
