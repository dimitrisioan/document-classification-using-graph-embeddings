well
yes
and
no
the
image
cant
be
on
the
screen
less
than
of
a
second
but
a
mixture
of
images
thats
about
of
the
field
that
was
supposed
to
be
there
and
of
the
subliminal
addition
could
be
overlaid
for
one
field
producing
the
same
overall
effect
to
our
sluggish
retinae
of
a
discrete
image
projected
for
second
this
is
a
idea
supposedly
splicing
in
a
frame
of

at
the

involved
talk
of
making

general
agreement
by
networks
not
to
do
it
a
few
years
ago
some
junior
person
at
an
advertising
agency
reinvented
subliminal
projection
and
one
commercial
went
out
on
tape
with
singleframe
messages
it
aired
on
a
few
stations
but
a
tech
at
one
station
previewing
the
tape
noticed
a
flicker
and
looked
at
the
tape
framebyframe
to
find
the
defect
big
flap
fcc
notified
commercial
pulled
press
reports
embarassed
ad
agency
you
could
probably
find
the
press
reports
via
dialog
or
nexis
if
you
wanted
now
that
everybody
has
vcrs
its
not
likely
that
anybody
could
get
away
with
this

tv
