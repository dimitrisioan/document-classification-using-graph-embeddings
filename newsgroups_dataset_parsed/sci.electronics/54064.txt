the
atari
used
a
cpu
just
like
their
entire
line
computers
as
well
as
the
game
machine
wrong
it
has
a
for
those
who
would
like
to
know
the
was
a
without
irq
or
nmi
and
with
only
address
lines
giving
memory
space
it
had
one
custome
chip
not
an
asic
in
the
sense
that
word
is
now
understood
the
tia
sometimes
known
as
the
although
most
other
manufacturers
list
that
as
the
cia
complex
interface
adapter
tia
stands
for
television
interface
adapter
and
it
handles
sound
paddles
and
the
minimal
video
hardware
the
possessed
didnt
know
about
it
being
called
the
thats
the
cia
found
in
the
commodore
i
dont
believe
this
chip
existed
when
the
was
around
the
tia
was
mapped
into
the
bottom
bytes
of
page
and
shadowed
in
the
bottom
bytes
of
page
to
get
an
image
on
the
screen
you
had
to
wait
until
the
raster
line
your
picture
started
at
load
bitmaps
for
this
line
into
the
sprite
registers
tell
them
what
x
positions
to
take
how
many
duplicates
you
wanted
etc
then
do
it
all
again
for
the
next
line
this
took
all
of
the
processors
time
during
the
visible
portion
of
the
display
there
was
also
a
standard
ram
io
timer
riot
plus
a
voltage
regulator
and
if
memory
serves
a
timer
thats
all
the
ram
was
mapped
into
the
top
bytes
of
page
and
shadowed
in
page
the
has
a
zeropage
addressing
mode
on
most
instructions
that
is
both
shorter
and
faster
than
the
normal
ones
so
it
is
important
on
a
machine
like
this
to
have
the
scratchpad
ram
in
page
unfortunately
it
also
wants
its
stack
to
be
in
page
the
stack
pointer
is
bits
and
the
high
byte
of
the
address
is
hardwired
to
the
iot
section
was
mapped
into
page
somewhere
bit
io
registers
cant
remember
if
each
bit
could
be
independantly
set
to
i
or
o
like
the
and
and
bit
timer
with
a
programmable
prescaler
i
think
this
was
some
power
of
there
were
no
interrupts
in
the
system
so
many
games
would
set
up
the
timer
at
some
known
time
go
away
and
do
something
else
for
a
while
then
sit
and
wait
for
the
timer
to
run
down
there
was
no
logic
in
the
box
to
do
address
decoding
the
riot
had
at
least
chip
select
pins
probably
one
active
high
one
active
low
and
i
imagine
the
tia
was
much
the
same
various
address
lines
were
fed
directly
to
chip
selects
the
likes
to
have
rom
right
at
the
top
of
memory
so
the
had
to
use
roms
with
active
high
chip
selects
not
exactly
normal
so
some
cartriges
had
a
in
them
to
convert
this
to
the
more
usual
active
low
chip
select
