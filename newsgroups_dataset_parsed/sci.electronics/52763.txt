dont

on
the

if
they

shields
you
still
have
a
capacitor
actually
and
i
think
i
said
this
in
the
original
but
perhaps
wasnt
clear
enough
there
is
usually
both
an
internal
and
an
external
dag
of
the
two
the
internal
dag
is
the
more
important
the
aluminization
of
the
back
of
the
phosphor
is
in
most
cases
not
adequate
to
guarantee
connection
to
the
anode
button
and
in
the
case
where
the
gun
assembly
includes
an
accelerating
electrode
at
anode
potential
most
definitely
does
not
provide
that
connection
bob
is
indeed
correct
here
in
more
than
one
way
a
look
in
the
old
rca
picture
tube
manual
backs
this
up
as
does
sams
reference
data
handbook
the
internal
coating
around
the
perimeter
of
the
crt
not
the
aluminum
or
tin
crt
face
coating
is
referred
to
as
a
dag
as
well
as
the
outer
coating
thankfully
i
didnt
need
to
go
to
a

to
