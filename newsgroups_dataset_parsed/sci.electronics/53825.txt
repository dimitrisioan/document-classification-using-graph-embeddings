NEEDED
I
HAD
A
SIMILAR
IDEA
FOR
A
FAXANSWERING
MACHINE
SWITCH
TO
PUT
BOTH
MACHINES
ON
ONE
LINE
YOU
ORDER
DISTINCTIVE
RINGING
FROM
YOUR
PHONE
COMPANY
THIS
IS
HERE
YOU
GET
A
SECOND
UNPUBLISHED
PHONE
NUMBER
WHEN
SOMEONE
CALLS
THIS
NUMBER
YOUR
PHONE
RINGS
WITH
SHORT
RINGS
INSTEAD
OF
LONG
RINGS
YOU
SET
UP
YOUR
ANSWERING
MACHINE
ON
RINGS
AND
YOUR
FAX
ON
SIX
RINGS
YOUD
GIVE
OUT
THE
NEW
AS
YOUR
FAX
A
DEVICE
WOULD
MEASURE
THE
LENGTH
OF
RINGS
WHEN
IT
DETECTS
A
SHORT
RING
IT
TURNS
OFF
YOUR
ANSWERING
MACHINE
FIVE
RINGS
LATER
YOUR
FAX
PICKS
UP
THE
CALL
THIS
SHOULD
BE
CHEAPER
AND
MORE
ELEGANT
THAN
THE
SWITCHES
NOW
AVAILABLE
BUT
THATS
NOT
WHAT
I
DID
IM
GIVING
OUT
THE
NEW
TO
MY
FRIENDS
AND
CUSTOMERS
THIS
SHOULD
LEAVE
THE
OLD
FOR
TELEMARKETERS
ETC
I
WONT
PICK
UP
THE
PHONE
WHEN
I
HEAR
THE
LONG
RINGS
WHY
MY
THOUGHTS
ARE
MY
OWN
WHEN
THEY
ARE
IN
BUT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
OUT
THEY
ARE
