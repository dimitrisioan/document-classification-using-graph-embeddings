WHY
ARE
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
GREEN
THE
MATERIAL
USED
TO
MAKE
THEM
GOES
BY
TWO
NAMES
IF
IT
IS
USED
TO
MAKE
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
IT
IS
CALLED
THE
SAME
MATERIAL
IS
USED
IN
THE
CRYOGENICS
INDUSTRYA
AND
MARINE
INDUSTRIES
AS
A
STRUCTURAL
MATERIAL
AND
IS
CALLED
AND
ARE
BOTH
GREEN
THEY
ARE
NOT
GREEN
BECAUSE
OF
A
SOLDER
MASKING
AGENT
THE
BASIC
INGREDIENTS
ARE
A
CLEAR
EPOXY
RESIN
AND
GLASS
FIBERS
I
AM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
THE
SPECS
ARE
ON
THE
RESIN
BUT
IF
YOU
ARE
REALLY
CURIOUS
YOU
CAN
CALL
NEMA
NATIONAL
ELECTRONICS
MANUFACTURING
ASSOCIATION
OR
CIBA
GEIGY
A
MAJOR
MANUFACTURER
OF
EPOXY
RESINS
TO
FIND
OUT
AS
AN
ASIDE
I
OCCASIONALLY
MIX
CLEAR
EPOXY
AND
GLASS
MICROSPHRES
TO
CAST
SMALL
STRUCTURES
FOR
CRYOGENICS
EXPERIMENTS
THE
PROPORTIONS
OF
GLASS
TO
EPOXY
ARE
ABOUT
THE
SAME
AS
IN
THEY
ARE
THE
SAME
GREEN
COLOR
