hams
can
legally
run
up
to
watts
it
is
very
unlikely
however
that
a
ham
would
be
running
that
kind
of
power
from
a
car
ham
rigs
not
possible
either
youd
need
about
a
amp
alternator
for
just
the
amplifier
i
can
just
see
it
you
need
to
slow
down
on
a
downgrade
so
you
hit
the
push
to
talk
button
now
that
indeed
is
possible
a
good
friend
of
mine
is
running
about
kw
pep
from
his
car
yes
he
does
have
a
second
alternator
yes
he
calls
the
rig
an
electronic
brake
since
the
engine
noticeably
slows
when
the
key
is
down
it
has
been
a
while
since
i
knew
the
electronics
of
ham
radio
but
i
seem
to
remember
that
pep
is
actually
the
real
power
which
makes
pep
actually
around
or
was
it
i
disremember
effective
transmitted
power
is
also
odd
in
that
it
takes
into
account
antenna
height
and
geometry
which
is
why
a
tv
station
with
a
klystron
might
advertise
a
megawatt
if
their
antenna
is
on
the
top
of
the
cn
tower
this
is
like
sears
hp
though
real
watts
still
isnt
impossible
about
with
a
alternator
less
if
the
alternator
produces
higher
voltages
its
only
three
horsepower
taking
into
account
inefficiencies
youll
feel
it
when
you
hit
the
key
but
not
too
much
