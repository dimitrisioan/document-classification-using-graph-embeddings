AMPLIFIERS
IN

MARK
YECK
WRITES
HEY
CAN
SOMEONE
CLUE
ME
IN
ON
THESE
AND
OTHER
WEIRD
TYPES
OF
AMPLIFIERS
JUST
A
BRIEF
INTRO
TO
THE
CONCEPTS
BEHIND
THESE
WOULD
BE
COOL
I
HAVE
THE
CLUES
ON
TYPE
A
B
AND
AB
ALREADY
AND
STUFF
BUT
THESE
OTHER
ONES
ARE
MENTIONED
OCCASIONALLY
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
DO
I
THINK
TYPE
D
IS
LIKE
A
PWM
SCHEME
OR
SOMETHING
THANX
IN
ADVANCED
THE
WHOLE
POINT
TO
THESE
WEIRD
AMPLIFIER
TYPES
IS
IMPROVED
EFFICIENCY
CLASS
D
AMPS
ARE
PWM
PULSE
WIDTH
MODULATION
AMPS
WHICH
WORK
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
SWITCHING
POWER
SUPPLIES
I
THINK
IVE
SEEN
THESE
THINGS
CALLED
CLASS
S
BEFORE
AS
WELL
THEYRE
CAPABLE
OF
VERY
HIGH
EFFICIENCIES
AND
WOULD
BE
SUITABLE
FOR
VERY
HIGH
POWER
IVE
YET
TO
SEE
ANYTHING
LIKE
THIS
USED
IN
AN
AUDIOPHILE
AMP
THOUGH
IVE
BEEN
TRYING
TO
DESIGN
A
THREEKILOWATTER
FOR
THE
LAST
YEAR
TO
BE
USED
AS
AN
INVERTER
FOR
AN
UPS
BUT
HAVE
BEEN
HAVING
SERIOUS
PROBLEMS
WITH
LAYOUT
PARASITICS
IRF
IN
PARALLEL
ANY
HELP
WITH
A
DOABLE
ISOLATED
DRIVE
CKT
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
IM
NOT
ABSOLUTELY
POSITIVE
ABOUT
THIS
BUT
I
BELEIVE
A
CLASS
G
AMP
IS
ONE
THAT
OPERATES
OFF
A
VARIABLE
OR
SWITCHED
POWER
SUPPLY
RAIL
VOLTAGE
THE
CARVER
AMPS
DO
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
THEY
USE
SOME
SORT
OF
PHASECONTROL
CIRCUIT
I
DO
NOT
FULLY
UNDERSTAND
ITS
OPERATION
TO
REDUCE
THE
TRANSFORMER
SIZE
AND
I
BELEIVE
THAT
IS
PATENTED
I
HAD
AN
APART
TRYING
TO
FIX
AND
FOUND
THAT
IT
HAD
THREE
RAIL
VOLTAGES
THAT
IT
SWITCHED
BETWEEN
I
RAN
A
SIMULATION
ON
PSPICE
AND
FOUND
THAT
THE
TOPOLOGY
WOULD
GREATLY
REDUCE
POWER
DISSIPATION
HEAT
UNDER
LARGESIGNAL
CONDITIONS
OR
WHEN
DRIVING
REACTIVE
LOADS
WHICH
DRAW
HIGH
CURRENT
AT
THE
ZEROVOLTAGE
CROSSINGS
