BRAD
KEPLEY
WRITES
I
JUST
HEARD
AN
UNBELIEVABLE
RUMOR
THAT
MOTOROLA
HAS
DECIDED
TO
DROP
THEIR
INTEGRATED
CIRCUIT
MANUFACTURE
BUSINESS
APPARENTLY
A
DIGIKEY
REP
CALLED
ONE
OF
OUR
PRODUCTION
COORDINATORS
FOR
OUT
INFORMATION
SO
THAT
WE
COULD
MAKE
PLANS
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
THAT
MOTO
WAS
GETTING
OUT
ANYBODY
ELSE
GET
A
CALL
ABOUT
THIS
TOO
MUCH
FOR
ME
ITS
ABOUT
LIKE
INTEL
ANNOUNCING
THEY
WERE
GETTING
OUT
OF
THE
IC
BUSINESS
THIS
RUMOR
DIDNT
HAPPEN
TO
APPEAR
ON
APRIL
IF
THIS
DIGIKEY
REP
WAS
SERIOUS
I
THINK
I
WILL
BUY
MY
PARTS
ELSEWHERE
IF
THAT
IS
THE
WAY
THEY
DO
BUSINESS
YOU
CANNOT
TRUST
THEM
MARK
