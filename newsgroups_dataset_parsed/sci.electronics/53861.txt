SUPPOSE
WE
HAVE
A
BOOLEAN
FUNCTION
WHICH
IS
A
MINIMAL
SUMOFPRODUCTS
DERIVED
FROM
A
KMAP
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
FABCD
BCD
ACD
ABC
ABC
THE
BOOKS
ON
LOGIC
DESIGN
I
HAVE
CONSULTED
ALL
SEEM
TO
IMPLY
THAT
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
ANALYSIS
ENDS
BUT
BY
FACTORING
OUT
THE
A
TERM
IN
THE
FUNCTION
WE
CAN
GET
FEWER
GATES
FABCD
BCD
ACD

BC
WHICH
YIELDS
GATES
YES
BUT
THE
MINIMIZATION
OF
GATES
IS
IMPORTANT
IN
PART
BECAUSE
OF
TIMING
CONSIDERATIONS
A
TTL
GATE
HAS
THE
BASIC
STRUCTURE
OF
ANDORINVERT
AND
AN
INVERSION
OF
A
SUM
OF
A
PRODUCT
IS
JUST
EXACTLY
ONE
GATE
DELAY
THE
REASON
TO
FIND
A
MINIMAL
SUM
OF
PRODUCTS
IS
THAT
THIS
MATCHES
A
HARDWARE
OPTIMIZATION
A
POSITIVEOR
GATE
SUCH
AS
THE
SOLUTION
USES
HAS
TWO
GATE
DELAYS
AND
THERES
ANOTHER
GATE
DELAY
IN
THE
SECOND
TERM
SO
THAT
THE
SECOND
SOLUTION
WHILE
SIMPLER
IN
LOGIC
SYMBOLS
CAN
BE
EXPECTED
TO
BE
SOMETHING
LESS
THAN
OPTIMAL
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
ECL
IS
SIMILAR
TO
TTL
IN
THAT
IT
CAN
SUPPORT
AN
ORAND
GATE
WITH
THE
MINIMUM
DELAY
UNLIKE
TTL
YOU
GET
BOTH
TRUE
AND
INVERSE
OUTPUTS
FOR
FREE
WHEN
USING
ECL
PALS
ARE
BASICALLY
LARGE
PROGRAMMABLE
ANDORINVERT
GATES
WITH
YOUR
CHOICE
OF
INTERNAL
CONNECTIONS
BETWEEN
THE
VARIOUS
SECTIONS
AND
PERHAPS
SOME
LATCHES
SO
A
MINIMUM
SUM
OF
PRODUCTS
ALSO
IS
A
WAY
TO
SHOEHORN
A
LOGIC
DESIGN
INTO
A
FEW
PALS
ITS
NOT
COMPARABLY
EASY
TO
DESIGN
WITH
A
MINIMIZATION
OF
LOGIC
GATES
BUT
SOME
SOFTWARE
PACKAGES
CLAIM
TO
ALLOW
YOU
TO
DO
SO
AND
WILL
TAKE
JUST
ABOUT
ANY
MESS
OF
GATES
AS
A
NODELIST
WITH
SERIES
LOGIC
ICS
AND
PRODUCE
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
A
LOGIC
CELL
ARRAY
TO
DO
THE
SAME
JOB
XILINXS
XACT
SOFTWARE
DOES
THIS
BY
TREATING
EACH
LOGIC
BLOCK
AS
A
MACRO
AND
EXPANDING
IT
ALL
OUT
THEN
SIMPLIFYING
