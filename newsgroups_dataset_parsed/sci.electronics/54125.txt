HOWARD
WRITES
THE
CONCRETE
FLOOR
ACCELERATES
THE
PROBLEM
BECAUSE
IT
IS
A
HEAT
SINK
AND
A
COLDER
LEADACID
BATTERY
SELFDISCHARGES
AT
A
SLIGHTLY
FASTER
RATE
THATS
WHY
THE
OLD
WIVES
TALE
OF
SITTING
IT
ON
A
PIECE
OF
WOOD
ON
THE
FLOOR
WORKS
TO
HELP
KEEP
FROM
KILLING
THE
BATTERY
AS
FAST
IT
INSULATES
THE
BATTERY
THERMALLY
IT
YOULL
SET
THE
BATTERY
DOWN
ON
A
PIECE
OF
STYROFOAM
IT
WILL
SELFDISCHARGE
EVEN
SLOWER
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
INACCURACIES
HERE
IN
FACT
A
COLDER
BATTERY
WILL
SELFDISCHARGE
MORE
SLOWLY
THIS
IS
WHY
BATTERIES
SHOULD
BE
STORED
IN
A
COOL
DRY
PLACE
AN
BATTERY
PLACED
ON
CONCRETE
DOES
NOT
BECOME
COLDER
THAN
ONE
PLACED
ON
WOOD
THE
BATTERY
THE
WOOD
AND
THE
CONCRETE
WILL
ALL
BE
AT
THE
SAME
GENERAL
TEMPERATURE
IGNORING
TEMPERATURE
FLUCTUATIONS
AND
THUS
NONE
WILL
EFFECT
THE
OTHER
THE
BEST
THING
WOULD
BE
TO
ATTACH
A
SMALL
LOAD
SUCH
AS
A
SMALL
TRANSISTOR
RADIO
WITH
THE
VOLUME
TURNED
DOWN
LOW
AND
LEAVE
IT
ON
CONSTANTLY
BUT
ALSO
TRICKLECHARGE
IT
EVERY
COUPLE
DAYS
TOO
TO
SHALLOW
CYCLE
THE
CHARGE
IN
THE
BATTERY
SUCH
MILD
EXERCISING
OF
A
LEADACID
BATTERY
IS
THE
NEXT
BEST
THING
TO
COMPLETELY
REMOVING
THE
ELECTROLYTE
FOR
STORAGE
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
EXERCISE
THE
BATTERY
JUST
KEEP
IT
CHARGED
A
TRICKLE
CHARGER
WILL
DO
THE
JOB
STUFF
DELETED
