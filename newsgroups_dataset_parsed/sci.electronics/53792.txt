hi
being
a
electronic
engineering
student
with
only
electronic
ii
under
my
belt
i
find
myself
needing
to
build
a
moderate
wattage
audio
amp
so
ill
throw
out
a
couple
of
question
for
the
vast
knowledge
of
the
net
please
explain
how
watts
are
calculated
in
audio
amp
circuits
no
not
pie
just
how
it
relates
to
one
of
the
following
ai
current
gain
av
voltage
gain
ap
power
gain
or
whatever
i
already
have
a
wonderful
cheap
ie
schematic
for
a
amp
but
i
would
like
to
crossimprove
the
circuit
the
problem
is
that
the
parts
list
has
and
as
amplifiers
they
look
like
pin
sip
packages
with
a
heatsink
this
schematic
was
published
in
a
mag
so
it
may
be
nonexistant
now
anyway
i
tried
looking
up
a
replacement
in
the
latest
digikey
cat
and
found
it
not
listed
the
closes
i
could
figure
was
a
pin
sip
as
anyone
got
any
ideas
i
thought
hey
i
can
rin
a
pspice
simulation
using
opamp
models
yea
great
it
worked
but
i
guess
the
wasnt
made
for
high
power
amps
as
a
result
i
got
a
voltage
gain
of
worse
than
i
started
with
does
anyone
have
a
pspice
ckt
file
with
cheap
yet
good
gain
how
about
some
models
for
some
of
the
chips
listed
in
this
email
any
ascii
chip
info
you
guys
can
send
me
im
open
to
suggestionsideascommentshelp
please
email
since
i
have
little
time
to
search
the
news
and
ill
post
if
theres
and
interest
