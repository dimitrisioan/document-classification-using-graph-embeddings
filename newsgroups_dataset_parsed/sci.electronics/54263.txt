RE
CLEAR
LCD
OR
LED
SHEETS
AN
IDEAL
ITEM
WOULD
BE
AN
LED
ARRAY
FOR
WHICH
EACH
LED
IS
ABOUT
SQUARE
YES
VERY
COARSE
THIS
IS
FOR
DISTANCE
VIEWING
BUT
ON
A
WINDOW
ANY
POINTERS
OF
SUGGESTIONS
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
WHAT
PRAY
TELL
ARE
YOU
PUTTING
TOGETHER
AND
WHAT
ABOUT
COSTS
AND
DOES
IT
HAVE
TO
BE
TRANSPARENT
AS
IN
TOTALLY
TRANSPARENT
OR
JUST
TRANSPARENT
ENOUGH
TO
ALLOW
LIGHT
FROM
THE
OTHER
SIDE
TO
SHINE
THROUGH
YES
IT
HAS
TO
BE
VERY
CLEAR
LIKE
IT
WASNT
THERE
AND
OF
COURSE
COST
IS
ALWAYS
A
FACTOR
I
AM
TRYING
TO
GET
AN
IDEA
OF
THE
FEASABILITY
OF
SUCH
AN
IDEA
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GIVE
TOO
MUCH
AWAY
MARK
