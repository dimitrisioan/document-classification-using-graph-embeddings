RE
RADAR
DETECTOR
DETECTORS
RANDY
AGEE
WRITES
IT
USED
TO
BE
THAT
THE
ONLY
WAY
THE
LAW
COULD
BE
ENFORCED
WAS
FOR
AN
OFFICER
TO
ACTUALLY
SEE
THE
RADAR
DETECTOR
NOT
ANY
MORE
MANY
LAW
ENFORCEMENT
AGENCIES
ARE
NOW
USING
RADAR
DETECTOR
DETECTORS
RIGHT
A
SUPER
SENSITIVE
RECEIVER
THAT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
PICKING
UP
RF
FROM
THE
RADAR
DETECTOR
ITSELF
MY
FIRST
REACTION
WAS
NO
WAY
BUT
GUESS
AGAIN
THESE
LITTLE
BUGGERS
REALLY
WORK
AND
THE
POLICE
ARE
WRITING
CITATIONS
RIGHT
AND
LEFT
FOR
PEOPLE
USING
RADAR
DETECTORS
ONE
NEWS
STORY
QUOTED
AN
OFFICER
AS
SAYING
THAT
HE
HAD
FOUND
THE
RADAR
DETECTOR
IN
ALL
OF
THE
CARS
HE
STOPPED
EXCEPT
ONE
AND
HE
COULD
NEVER
FIGURE
OUT
WHERE
IT
WAS
BUT
HE
KNEW
IT
WAS
THERE
THIS
TENDS
TO
MAKE
ONE
ASSUME
THERE
ARE
FEW
FALSE
ARREST
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
ABOUT
RADAR
DECTECTORS
ALL
THEY
ARE
IS
A
PASSIVE
DEVICE
MUCH
LIKE
THE
RADIO
IN
YOUR
CAR
THEY
WORK
AS
AN
ANTENNA
PICKING
UP
THAT
RADAR
SIGNALS
THAT
THE
RADAR
GUN
SENDS
OUT
THEREFORE
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
WAY
OF
DETECTING
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
ANY
MORE
THAN
THERE
WOULD
BE
OF
DETECTING
WHETHER
SOME
ONE
HAD
A
RADIO
IN
THEIR
CAR
