can
radio
freq
be
used
to
measure
distance
im
wondering
if
its
possible
to
use
radio
waves
to
measure
the
distance
between
a
transmitters
and
receiver
seems
to
me
that
you
should
be
able
to
measure
the
signal
strength
and
determine
distance
this
would
be
for
short
distances
ft
and
i
would
need
to
have
accuracy
of
inches
or
so
how
about
measuring
vertical
distance
as
well
any
chance
or
am
i
getting
ridiculous
what
frequencies
would
be
best
for
this
or
does
matter
sorry
if
im
mucking
up
the
network
with
one
of
those
questions
best
answered
by

mail
and
i
apologize
for
not
