RE
USING
GENERATED
POWER
ON
LARGE
SOUND
SYSTEMS
IN
ARTICLE
PASHDOWNSLACKSIMESCOM
PETE
ASHDOWN
WRITES
IVE
BOTHERED
THE
RENTAL
SHOPS
AND
AUDIO
SHOPS
ABOUT
THE
PROBLEM
BUT
MOST
OF
THEM
HAVE
PRECIOUS
LITTLE
EXPERIENCE
IN
DEALING
WITH
GENERATED
POWER
MY
SUSPICION
IS
THAT
I
DONT
REALLY
NEED
ANYTHING
LARGER
THAN
AND
THIS
COULD
ALL
BE
RESOLVED
WITH
A
TRANSFORMER
OF
SOME
SORT
NOPE
YOUR
PROBLEM
IS
EITHER
BEING
CAUSED
BY
EXCESSIVE
VOLTAGE
DROP
IN
THE
LONG
CABLE
FROM
THE
GENERATOR
OR
JUST
PLAIN
NOT
HAVING
ENOUGH
POWER
I
WOULD
SUSPECT
THAT
THOSE
AMPS
ARE
GOING
TO
DRAW
A
LOT
OF
CURRENT
ON
SHORT
PEAKS
YOU
CAN
TRY
USING
LARGER
AND
SHORTER
CABLES
TO
THE
GENERATOR
OR
TRY
STRAPPING
THE
AMPS
FOR
SERVICE
AND
RUNNING
MAINS
CABLES
OUT
WHICH
WILL
MINIMIZE
THE
LINE
DROP
IF
THESE
DONT
WORK
THOUGH
YOURE
GOING
TO
NEED
A
BIGGER
GENERATOR
I
ASSUME
THAT
YOURE
USING
WELLMAINTAINED
GENERATORS
AND
HAVE
WATCHED
THE
VOLTAGE
OUTPUT
ON
THE
GENERATOR
PROPERLY
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
COMING
OUT
OF
THE
UNLOADED
GENERATOR
YOULL
NEVER
GET
AT
THE
OTHER
END
CAN
ANYONE
OFFER
ANY
ADVICE
I
WANT
TO
DO
A
LOT
OF
OUTDOOR
EVENTS
THIS
SUMMER
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
THIS
POWER
PROBLEM
COULD
BE
RESOLVED
EASILY
IVE
BEEN
LOOKING
INTO
BUYING
A
POWERPACK
SO
I
COULD
TAP
INTO
JUNCTION
BOXES
DIRECTLY
BUT
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHERE
TO
START
ONE
THAT
WOULD
RESOLVE
MY
GENERATOR
PROBLEMS
AS
WELL
WOULD
BE
OF
HIGH
VALUE
TO
ME
I
RECOMMEND
YOU
TALK
WITH
AN
ELECTRICIAN
WHO
HAS
EXPERIENCE
IN
THIS
SORT
OF
WORK
AND
NOT
WITH
THE
PROAUDIO
PEOPLE
ALSO
I
RECOMMEND
THAT
YOU
DONT
TRY
TO
TAP
INTO
JUNCTION
BOXES
AT
ALL
BUT
HIRE
A
LICENSED
ELECTRICIAN
IF
YOU
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
IVE
HAD
TO
CLEAN
UP
AFTER
TWO
PEOPLE
WHO
NEARLY
KILLED
THEMSELVES
PLAYING
IN
HOT
BOXES
AND
IT
WASNT
MUCH
FUN
