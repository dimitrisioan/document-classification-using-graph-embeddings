VICTORIA

SAYS
A
POSSIBILITY
FOR
THE
SOFTWARE
REGISTRATION
CONONDRUM
WOULD
BE
TO
HAVE
THE
DISTRIBUTOR
REGISTER
THE
COPY
WHEN
THE
SOFTWARE
WAS
SOLD
THE
CLERK
STICKS
IT
THATS
KIND
OF
EXTRA
WORK
THAT
ONE
CANNOT
EXPECT
THE
STORE
PEOPLE
TO
DO
IMHO
IT
WOULD
BE
EASIER
IF
COMPANIES
SELL
THEIR
SOFTWARE
AS
CHEAPLY
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
TO
SELL
THE
CUSTOMERS
DETAIL
MANUALS
FOR
THE
BRAINDEADS
QUICK
REFERENCE
BOOKS
HOW
TO
DO
BOOKS
AND
VIDEOS
PAID
SUPPORT
HOT
LINE
FOR
THE
REGISTERED
PURCHASERS
THESE
CAN
BE
PART
OF
THEIR
PACKAGE
I
HAVE
SEEN
MANY
BOOKS
TO
TEACH
PEOPLE
HOW
TO
USE
DOS
WP
AND
OTHER
SOFTWARE
I
I
SUSPECT
EITHER
USERS
CANT
READ
THE
MANUALS
OR
THEY
DONT
HAVE
MANUALS
EITHER
WAY
THERE
IS
TO
BE
MADE
BTW
BOOKS
ARE
QUITE
A
BIT
MORE
EXPENSIVE
TO
REPRODUCE
THAN
A
DISK
WHAT
IS
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
PARALLEL
PORT
SECURITY
KEYS
I
HAVENT
USED
ANYTHING
THAT
HAD
HARDWARE
KEY
COPY
PROTECTION
SCHEMES
SO
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
DRAWBACKS
ARE
I
KNOW
THE
COMPANIES
THAT
MAKE
THEM
CLAIM
THEYRE
UNCRACKABLE
WITH
THE
POPULARITY
OF
MULTITASKING
AND
PSEUDO
MULTITASKING
SYSTEMS
EG
WINDOZE
MACK
SYSTEM
IT
IS
PRETTY
EASY
TO
RUN
A
DEBUGGER
AND
FIGURE
OUT
THE
PROTECTION
SCHEMES
BY
DISASSEMBLINGTRACINGTRAPPING
THE
APPLICATION
DURING
RUN
TIME
SCHEMES
LIKE
COMPRESSED
SOFTWARE
SPECIAL
LOADERS
WOULD
BE
EASY
PRAY
EVEN
TO
BEGINNER
HACKERS
HARDWARE
KEYS
UNLESS
WELL
DESIGNED
AND
TOTALLY
TRANSPARENT
IS
A
PAIN
IN
THE
BT
WE
HAVING
USING
A
PIECE
OF
SOFTWARE
UNDER
WINDOZE
THAT
USES
A
HARDWARE
KEY
THE
KEY
INTERFERS
WITH
THE
PRINTER
STUFF
WITH
OTHER
PROGRAMS
AND
OFTEN
HAS
TO
BE
UNPLUGGED
FOR
THOSE
SOFTWARE
TO
WORK
PROPERLY
BUT
IVE
SEEN
CRACKS
OF
AUTODESK
FLOATING
AROUND
I
DONT
HAVE
ONE
SO
DONT
ASK
AND
I
HAD
HEARD
THAT
IT
HAD
PARRALEL
PORT
KEYS
ALL
THE
HACKER
HAS
TO
DO
IS
TO
REMOVEMODIFY

COMMUNICATE
