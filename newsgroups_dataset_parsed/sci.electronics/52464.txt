FRED

CULPEPPER
WROTE
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AGO
I
PUT
TOGETHER
A
TESLA
CIRCUIT
WHICH
WAS
PUBLISHED
IN
AN
ELECTRONICS
MAGAZINE
AND
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
CIRCUIT
WHICH
IS
REFERRED
TO
HERE
THIS
ONE
USED
A
FLYBACK
TRANSFORMER
FROM
A
TV
ONTO
WHICH
YOU
WOUND
YOUR
OWN
PRIMARY
WINDINGS
IT
ALSO
USED
POWER
TRANSISTORS
IN
A
TO
YEARS
AGO
I
BUILT
A
VOLT
TESLA
AND
THE
THING
WAS
VERY
SPECTACULAR
BUT
BESIDES
SCARINGAMAZING
FRIENDS
DEPENDING
ON
THEIR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
SCIENCE
AND
GENERATING
STRONG
EMI
I
NEVER
FOUND
ANYTHING
USEFUL
THAT
COULD
BE
DONE
WITH
IT
IS
THERE
ANY
REALWORLD
APPLICATION
FOR
TESLA
COILS
TODAY
DAVID
PRUTCHI
FIRST
OF
ALL
REALIZE
THAT
TESLA
INVENTED
AC
POWER
GENERATORS
MOTORS
TRANSFORMERS
CONDUCTORS
ETC
TECHNICALLY
ALL
TRANSFORMERS
ARE
TESLA
COILS
IN
GENERAL
THOUGH
WHEN
SOMEONE
REFERS
TO
A
TESLA
COIL
THEY
MEAN
AN
AIR
CORE
RESONANT
TRANSFORMER
THE
TV
FLYBACK
VERSION
TESLA
COIL
SEE
THE
ENCYCLOPEDIAOFELECTRONICCIRCUITS
FOR
DIAGRAM
HAS
NOT
AN
AIR
CORE
IT
IS
OF
A
CLASS
OF
CIRCUIT
CALLED
OSCILLATING
SHUTTLE
CIRCUIT
OSC
GENERALLY
OSCS
ARE
HIGHLY
EFFICIENT
BUT
THIS
VERSION
USES
TRANSISTORS
AND
RESISTORS
WHICH
ARE
VERY
LOSSY
DEVICES
TYPICALLY
TESLA
USED
ACTIVE
REACTANCES
INSTEAD
OF
PASSIVE
RESISTORS
SO
THAT
HE
COULD
ACHIEVE
EFFICIENCIES
OF
AND
BETTER
THE
USUAL
APPLICATION
OF
AN
AIRCORE
RESONANT
TRANSFORMER
OR
OF
AN
OSC
IS
TO
PRODUCE
STRONG
EMI
FOR
WIRELESS
BROADCASTS
HOW
WELL
DO
YOU
THINK
YOUR
COMPUTER
SCREEN
WOULD
WORK
IF
WE
REMOVED
THE
HF
HV
TESLA
FLYBACK
COIL
FROM
IT
IF
WE
WERE
TO
REMOVE
FROM
OUR
HOMES
AND
INDUSTRIES
ALL
TESLA
COILS
OUR
LIGHTS
WOULD
GO
DARK
OUR
CARS
WOULD
SPUTTER
AND
DIE
OUR
RADIOS
WOULD
GO
SILENT
OUR
INDUSTRIES
WOULD
GRIND
TO
A
HALT
AND
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GO
BACK
TO
USING
COAL
FOR
HEAT
GAS
FOR
LAMPS
HORSES
FOR
TRANSPORTATION
STEAM
FOR
POWER
AND
TELEGRAPH
FOR
COMMUNICATION
IS
THAT
REAL
WORLD
ENOUGH
FOR
YOU
GET
THE
MESSAGE
WE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
THE
CONVIENIENCES
WE
HAVE
TODAY
IF
NOT
FOR
TESLA
GIVE
CREDIT
WHERE
CREDIT
IS
DUE
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
UP
TO
EDISON
WED
STILL
BE
IN
THE
CENTURY
FLAME
ME
AT
YOUR
OWN
PERIL
IM
VERY
GOOD
AT
PUTTING
EDISON
DOWN
ET
TESLA
WAS
YEARS
AHEAD
OF
HIS
TIME
PERHAPS
NOW
HIS
TIME
COMES
