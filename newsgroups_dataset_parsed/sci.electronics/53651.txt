WHAT
SORT
OF
LAMP
IS
THE
LITTLE
GLASS
BULB
FOUND
INSIDE
THE
STARTER
MMIT
SORT
OF
REMINDS
ME
OF
A
NEON
LAMP
STARTERS
APPEAR
OPEN
WHEN
M
MMWITH
AN
OHM
METER
SO
THE
LITTLE
LAMP
IS
EITHER
A
NEON
OR
HAS
A
CAPACIT
MMIN
SERIES
WITH
IT
MM
MM
I
HAVE
SEEN
THESE
THINGS
ALL
MY
LIFE
BUT
NEVER
READ
A
REALLY
GOOD
MMDESCRIPTION
OF
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
INSIDE
THAT
LITTLE
CAN
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
A
BIMETALLIC
STRIP
IS
JUST
IN
CASE
IT
IS
TWO
STRIPS
OF
DIFFERENT
METALS
BONDED
TOGETHER
WHICH
WHEN
HEATED
BEND
TO
ONE
SIDE
CHECK
OUT
THE
BLINKER
GLOBE
IN
YOUR
CHRISTMAS
TREE
LIGHTS
SO
WHEN
YOU
TURN
ON
THE
POWER
THIS
CAUSES
THE
BULB
TO
WORK
LIKE
A
NEON
HEATING
UP
AND
SHORTING
OUT
THUS
PROVIDING
A
LOOP
TO
POWER
THE
HEATERS
IN
THE
MAIN
TUBE
WHEN
THE
TUBE
FIRES
INSUFFICIENT
CURRENT
RUNS
THROUGH
THE
STARTER
TO
KEEP
THE
HEAT
UP
AND
THE
BIMETALIC
STRIP
STRAIGHTENS
OUT
OC
BTW
I
TOO
THOUGHT
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
SMALL
NEON
SO
ONE
DAY
WHEN
THE
NEON
IN
MY
SISTERS
DIGITAL
FLIP
THE
METAL
SQUARES
TYPE
CLOCK
BROKE
FLIMSY
LEADS
I
REPLACED
IT
WITH
ONE
FROM
A
STARTER
WELL
POWERING
UP
MADE
A
BIT
OF
A
MESS
OF
THE
CLOCK
