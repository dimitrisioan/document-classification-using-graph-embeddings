THE
LEADACID
SECONDARY
CELL
DISCHARGE
REACTION
IS
EXOTHERMIC
I
AM
GLAD
YOU
DO
NOT
DISPUTE
THIS
POINT
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
THE
LEAD
STORAGE
BATTERY
TO
DISCHARGE
IT
SHOULD
BE
STORED
SUCH
THAT
ITS
CHARGED
STATE
IS
THE
EQUILIBRIUM
STATE
DURING
WINTER
THE
GROUND
BE
IT
COVERED
WITH
CONCRETE
DIRT
OR
WOOD
MAINTAINS
A
COOLER
TEMPERATURE
ON
AVERAGE
THAN
THE
SURROUNDING
AIR
OR
THE
BATTERY
THE
HEAT
CAPACITY
OF
AIR
IS
LESS
THAN
THAT
OF
CONCRETE
DIRT
OR
WOOD
SO
IT
HEATS
FASTER
CONVERSELY
AIR
COOLS
FASTER
TOO
THE
NORMAL
STORAGE
PROCEDURE
FOR
A
BATTERY
IS
TO
LEAVE
IT
IN
AN
UNHEATED
GARAGE
OR
BASEMENT
THE
STORAGE
SURFACE
IS
OFTEN
COOLER
THAN
THE
SURROUNDING
AIR
WITH
THE
BATTERY
TEMPERATURE
SOMEWHERE
INBETWEEN
EG
THE
BASEMENT
AIR
TEMPERATURE
MAY
BE
F
THE
FLOOR
TEMPERATURE
F
AND
THE
BATTERY
TEMPERATURE
F
THE
AIR
TEMPERATURE
IS
HIGHER
THAN
THE
BATTERY
TEMPERATURE
THE
HEAT
OF
REACTION
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
MOVE
UP
THE
GRADIENT
THE
FLOOR
TEMPERATURE
IS
LOWER
THAN
THE
BATTERY
TEMPERATURE
AND
HEAT
IS
GOING
TO
MOVE
TO
IT
THE
FLOOR
IS
AN
INCREDIBLE
HEAT
SINK
MIGHT
DEPEND
ON
WHERE
YOU
LIVE
I
KNOW
LOCALLY
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
WINTER
THE
GROUND
AND
CONCRETE
FLOOR
WITHIN
SHEDS
AND
GARAGES
UNHEATED
IS
SIGNIFACANTLY
WARMER
THAN
THE
AVERAGE
AIR
TEMPERATURE
THE
AIR
DOES
GET
WARMER
DURING
THE
DAY
BUT
DURING
THE
NIGHT
THE
GROUND
AND
CONCRETE
IS
DEFINITELY
WARMER
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
PROTECTED
BY
THE
WALLS
FROM
THE
ALBEDO
EFFECT
AND
THE
NIGHTS
ARE
LONGER
BY
SEVERAL
HOURS
