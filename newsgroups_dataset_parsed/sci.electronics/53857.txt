BUILDING

JOHN
HAWKINSON
WRITES
ONE
OTHER
THING
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
MENTIONED
SOMETHING
ABOUT
NEARUV
LIGHT
BEING
CHEAPER
TO
GET
AT
THAN
ACTUAL
UV
LIGHT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
HE
WAS
REFERRING
TO
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GET
INTO
A
SEMANTIC
ARGUMENT
BUT
CONTRARY
TO
SOME
OTHER
POSTINGS
NEAR
UV
LIGHT
IS
ACTUAL
UV
LIGHT
THE
NEAR
MEANS
THAT
IT
IS
CLOSE
TO
THE
VISIBLE
SPECTRUM
IE
OF
RELATIVELY
LONG
WAVELENGTH
NOT
THAT
IT
IS
NEARLY
UV
IM
SURE
YOU
CAN
FIGURE
OUT
NOW
JUST
WHAT
FAR
UV
IS
REGULAR
INCANDENSCENT
FLASHLIGHT
BULBS
EMIT
TINY
AMOUNTS
OF
UV
IN
THE
NEAR
END
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
SUCH
THAT
A
FILTER
CAN
BE
USED
TO
REMOVE
THE
VISIBLE
LIGHT
AND
THUS
CREATE
A
WEAK
UV
SOURCE
STRONGER
SOURCES
ARE
GOING
TO
REQUIRE
GAS
PROBABLY
MERCURY
VAPOR
DISCHARGE
TUBES
SUCH
AS
FLUORESCENT
TUBES
WITH
UV
PHOSPHOR
BE
CAREFUL
THOUGH
STRONG
UV
SOURCES
CAN
CAUSE
PHYSIOLOGICAL
DAMAGE
ESPECIALLY
TO
THE
EYES
THE
SHORTER
WAVELENGTHS
ARE
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
IT
WOULDNT
PROJECT
A
BEAM
LIKE
A
FLASHLIGHT
BUT
REPLACING
THE
TUBES
IN
A
PORTABLE
FLUORESCENT
LANTERN
WITH
UV
TUBES
WOULD
BE
A
RELATIVELY
CHEAP
WAY
TO
CREATE
A
PORTABLE
SOURCE
IT
WOULD
BE
BRIGHT
ENOUGH
TO
BE
USEFUL
BUT
NOT
DANGEROUSLY
SO
