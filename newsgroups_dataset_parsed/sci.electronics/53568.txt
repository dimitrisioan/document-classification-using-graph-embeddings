RUSS
CRISP
WRITES
IM
CONSIDERING
MODERNIZING
SOME
OLD
WIRING
IN
MY
HOME
AND
I
NEED
A
LITTLE
ADVICE
ON
OUTLET
WIRING
SEVERAL
OUTLETS
ARE
THE
OLD
TWO
PRONG
TYPE
WITHOUT
THE
GROUND
NATURALLY
THE
WIRE
FEEDING
THESE
OUTLETS
IS
WITHOUT
THE
GROUND
WIRE
I
NOTICED
AT
THE
FUSEBOX
THAT
SOME
CIRCUITS
HAVE
THE
WITH
GROUND
AND
THAT
ON
THESE
CIRCUITS
THE
GROUND
WIRE
WAS
TIED
TO
THE
SAME
BUS
AS
THE
NEUTRAL
WHITE
WIRE
SO
HERES
MY
QUESTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ID
HAVE
THE
SAME
ELECTRICAL
CIRCUIT
IF
I
HOOKED
THE
JUMPER
FROM
THE
NEUTRAL
OVER
TO
THE
GROUND
SCREW
ON
NEW
THREE
PRONG
GROUNDING
OUTLETS
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
MY
REASONING
HERE
NO
NO
NOOO
THE
GROUND
GREEN
WIRE
IS
FOR
SAFETY
NO
CURRENT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
FLOW
IN
IT
UNDER
NORMAL
CONDITIONS
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THERES
NORMALLY
NO
VOLTAGE
DROP
IN
IT
EITHER
IT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
SAFE
TO
TOUCH
THE
GROUND
WIRE
EVEN
IF
YOURE
GROUNDED
IN
SOME
OTHER
WAY
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
NEUTRAL
WHITE
WIRE
IS
AS
DAVE
VANDERBYL
CORRECTLY
SAID
THE
RETURN
FOR
THE
HOT
WIRE
SINCE
CURRENT
FLOWS
IN
IT
THERES
A
VOLTAGE
DROP
IF
YOU
PLUG
A
HEAVY
LOAD
INTO
A
PROPERLYWIRED
GROUNDED
OUTLET
YOU
CAN
COMMONLY
MEASURE
A
VOLT
OR
SO
OF
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
NEUTRAL
AND
GROUND
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
CONNECTED
TOGETHER
AT
THE
BREAKER
PANEL
BUT
NOWHERE
REPEAT
NOWHERE
ELSE
WELL
ALMOST
THERE
ARE
STRANGE
EXCEPTIONS
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
SUBPANELS
WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
IF
YOU
WANT
THREEPRONG
OUTLETS
WITHOUT
ADDITIONAL
WIRING
IS
TO
USE
A
GFCI
OUTLET
OR
BREAKER
BUT
THE
OUTLET
WILL
BE
CHEAPER
IN
FACT
DEPENDING
ON
WHERE
YOU
ARE
PUTTING
YOUR
NEW
OUTLETS
A
GFCI
MAY
BE
REQUIRED
THERE
IS
A
FAQ
ON
ELECTRICAL
WIRING
POSTED
REGULARLY
TO
RECWOODWORKING
AND
NEWSANSWERS
IT
GOES
INTO
GREAT
DETAIL
ON
THESE
ISSUES
INCLUDING
GFCIS
AND
YOU

PROBABLY
READ
IT
BEFORE
ASKING
ANY
MORE
