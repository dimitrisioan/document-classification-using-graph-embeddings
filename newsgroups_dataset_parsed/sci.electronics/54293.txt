I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
NEW
PORTABLE
CD
PLAYER
FOR
THE
OFFICE
AND
I
NOTICE
THAT
IT
PROUDLY
PROCLAIMS
TIMES
OVERSAMPLING
ON
THE
BOX
THE
DATA
IS
ONLY
EVER
READ
ONCE
BARRING
MISTRACKS
AND
SUCH
OF
COURSE
AND
EVENTUALLY
GETS
TURNED
INTO
KHZ
BIT
TWO
CHANNEL
DATA
OVERSAMPLING
TAKES
TWO
DISCRETE
DATA
POINTS
AND
INTERPOLATES
POINTS
BETWEEN
THEM
FOR
N
TIMES
OVERSAMPLING
WHEN
I
ASKED
PEOPLE
SAID
THAT
THE
INTERPOLATION
WAS
NOT
SIMPLY
LINEAR
INTERPOLATION
BUT
SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE
COMPLICATED
YOU
ARE
QUITE
CORRECT
IN
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
IN
CASE
YOU
CARE
THE
FILTERING
METHOD
USES
AN
FIR

ID
GUESS
THAT
CD
MAKERS
USE
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
METHOD
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
KNOW
THE
REAL
ANSWER
TYPICAL
IN
THE
OLD
UNITS
WAS
A
THIRTEENTAP
FIR
IMPLEMENTED
AS
A
DEDICATED
HARDWARE
ADDITION
CIRCUIT
AT
THIS
KIND
OF
SPEED
SLOW
BY
DIGITAL
STANDARDS
SUCH
AN
ADDER
IS
MUCH
LESS
EXPENSIVE
THAN
ANALOG
COMPONENTS
OF
COMPARABLE
PRECISION
I
GLEANED
THIS
INFORMATION
FROM
A
HARDWARE
MANUAL
FOR
AN
OLD
CD
PLAYER
DESIGN
WHERE
ONE
WOULD
FIND
SIMILAR
INFO
FOR
A
PARTICULAR
CD
THE
DIGITAL
FILTER
IS
AN
INTERESTING
COMPONENT
FROM
MY
POINT
OF
VIEW
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
THE
DIGITAL
FILTER
IS
A
KIND
OF
INTERPOLATION
SCHEME
READ
A
BOOK
ON
NUMERICAL
ANALYSIS
TO
SEE
JUST
HOW
BROAD
THE
TERM
INTERPOLATION
IS
