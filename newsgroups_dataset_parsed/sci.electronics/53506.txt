as
for
adcoms
mobil
they
are
going
with
amps
that
canb
use
balanced
inputs
a
very
nice
toy
but
im
afraid
its
goig
to
push
their
amps
beyound
resonable
price
ranges
especialy
because
taking
advantage
of
those
balanced
inputs
requires
a
rca
to
balanced
adapter
umm
when
i
was
doing
sound
reinforcement
for
a
living
i
used
to
get
direct
boxes
which
convert
unbalanced
jacks
to
balanced
xlrs
for
about
each
or
a
little
more
for
higher
quality
youll
need
two
for
a
stereo
signal
of
course
and
a
little
adapter
thingy
from
radio
sht
to
convert
from
rca
to
total
cost
should
be
around
you
can
also
buy
transformers
for
quite
a
bit
less
and
wire
them
yourself
total
cost
there
should
be
under
you
can
get
all
this
stuff
from
any
pro
music
shop
that
sells
sound
reinforcement
gear
the
benefit
no
noise
that
you
can
hear
will
be
generated
in
the
cables
going
to
the
component
with
the
balanced
inputs
even
when
you
run
them
in
bad
places
like
next

power
