JOHN
RUCKSTUHL
WRITES
I
KNOW
THIS
IS
A
LONG
SHOT
BUT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
SOLVENT
I
SHOULD
USE
TO
CLEAN
DUCTTAPE
ADHESIVE
FROM
CARPET
YET
ANOTHER
SUGGESTION
BUT
THIS
ONE
IS
NONTOXIC
ALTHOUGH
I
WOULD
HANDLE
IT
LIKE
ANY
OTHER
CLEANER
AND
IT
SMELLS
NICE
THE
CHEMICAL
IS
CALLED
DLIMONENE
AND
IT
SMELLS
LIKE
LEMON
PEELS
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
LEMON
EXTRACT
OF
SOME
KIND
YOU
MIGHT
FIND
IT
IN
A
HARDWARE
STORE
SOLD
AS
A
GENERALPURPOSE
SOLVENT
BUT
YOUR
BEST
BET
WOULD
BE
ANY
BIKE
STORE
IT
IS
USED
AS
A
CHAINCLEANING
FLUID
IT
WORKS
ON
STICKER
GLUE
CRAYONS
GREASE
OIL
ETC
ITS
CLEAR
YELLOW
IN
THE
BOTTLE
AND
YOU
CAN
USE
IT
STRAIGHT
IF
YOU
ADD
WATER
IT
CHANGES
TO
A
CREAMY
CONSISTENCY
WHICH
IS
GOOD
FOR
SOME
JOBS
