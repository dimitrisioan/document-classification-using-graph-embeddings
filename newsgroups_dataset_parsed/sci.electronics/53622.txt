WRITES
HOW
THICK
DO
I
NEED
TO
MAKE
A
PCB
TRACE
FOR
AMPS
OF
CURRENT
AND
DOES
ANYBODY
HAVE
ANY
OTHER
THOUGHTS
ON
THE
PROCESS
WHAT
KIND
OF
PCB
TO
USE
MATERIALS
THICKNESS
OF
COPPER
ANY
ADVICE
GRACIOUSLY
ACCEPTED
IN
FOUR
REPLIES
IVE
SEEN
NO
HARD
NUMBERS
SO
HERE
GOES
FOR
TRACES
ON
THE
OUTSIDE
NOT
INNER
LAYERS
EXPECT
IN
OZ
COPPER
AT
AMPS
THE
FOLLOWING
TEMPERATURE
RISES
VERSUS
WIDTH
THIS
IS
FROM

SEVENTH

PG
WHICH
CLAIMS
IN

TO
BE
FROM
WIDTH
TEMP
RISE
INCHES
DEGREES
C
AT
AMPS
THE
RISE
FOR
THE
WIDTH
IS
ONLY
ABOUT
DEGREES
POWER
GOES
AS
SQUARE
OF
THE
CURRENT
PLUS
THE
COPPER
RESISTANCE
GOES
UP
AS
TEMPERATURE
GOES
UP
CERTAINLY
TRACES
SHOULD
BE
AMPLE
FOR
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
AND
OUNCE
COPPER
ALMOST
CUTS
THE
REQUIRED
WIDTH
IN
HALF
ID
DO
OZ
AT
ABOUT
WIDTH
MYSELF
I
THINKGIVEN
THAT
THE
RATED
CURRENT
IS
AMPS
AND
THE
IS
A
TRANSIENT
OR
FAULT
CONDITION
THERES
ANOTHER
QUESTION
WILL
THE
VOLTAGE
DROP
BE
LOW
ENOUGH
BUT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
FIGURE
THIS
ONE
OUT
WITH
WIRE
TABLES
OR
JUST
THE
RESISTIVITY
OF
COPPER
KEEP
TRACES
SHORT
AND
USE
SEPARATE
SENSING
TRACES
WHERE
APPROPRIATE
AS
MENTIONED
BY
ANOTHER
