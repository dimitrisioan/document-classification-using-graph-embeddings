I
AM
SOMEWHAT
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
DB
MEASUREMENTS
AS
THEY
APPLY
TO
ELECTRICAL
CIRCUITS
IE
IT
IS
THE
GAIN
OF
FOR
EXAMPLE
AN
AMPLIFIER
MEASURED
ON
A
LOGARITHMIC
SCALE
HOWEVER
THIS
REQUIRES
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
REFERENCE
VALUE
IE
THE
OUPUT
IS
EG
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
INPUT
SIGNAL
STUFF
DELETED
WHAT
YOU
ACTUALLY
TALKING
ABOUT
HERE
IS
DBM
AND
NOT
DB
HOWEVER
THE
TERMS
ARE
USED
LOOSELY
BY
MOST
PEOPLE
DBM
IS
POWER
WITH
RESPACT

DB
IS

ENGLISH

I

I

SIMILARLY
PEOPLE
USUALLY
USE
DB
FOR
DBM
ANOTHER
COMMON
MISTAKE
IS
SPELLING
DB
INSTEAD
OF
DB
AS
YOU
DID
IN
YOUR

SEE
THE

THE

THAT
REMAINS
IN

IS
THE

UNIT
USED
SOMETIMES
THIS
WILL
BE
A

POWER
SUCH
AS

IMPEDANCE
WHICH
SHOULD
ALSO
BE

IN

OR

LIKE

IN
AN

OF
THAT
IMPEDANCE
LEADING
TO
AN
ACCEPTED
NOTATION
OF

MAYBE
IT
MIGHT
BE

DISREGARDING
THE
IMPEDANCE
OF
THE

AND
POWER
DEVELOPED
USING

AMPLITUDE
RATHER
THAN

POWER
OR
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
AN
ARBITRARY
OR
OMITTED
REFERENCE
THAT
IS
NOT
INCLUDED
IN
THE
NOTATION
LEADING
TO
JUST
PLAIN
DB
SO
LOOK
AT
IT
THIS
WAYDB
HAS
AN

REFERENCE
WHILE

SUCH
AS
DBM
HAS
AN
EXPLICIT
