PHANTOMS
IN
MY
SONY
RECEIVER
WHILE
I
HAVE
GOTTEN
YEARS
OUT
OF
THIS
DIGITAL
RECEIVER
IT
HAS
BEEN
ACTING
VERRY
STRANGE
OF
LATE
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
FOLLOWING
SYMPTOMS
MAY
HELP
SOMEONE
DIAGNOSE
THE
ERROR
I
KNOW
THAT
WHATEVER
LITHIUM
MEMORY
BACKUP
IT
HAD
HAS
LONG
DIED
THUS
IF
I
UNPLUG
IT
IT
WONT
REMEMBER
THE
PRESETS
IT
HAS
GIVEN
UP
LISTENING
TO
THE
REMOTE
I
TRIED
CHANGING
THE
REMOTES
BATTERIES
WHEN
I
TRY
A
REMOTE
FUNCTION
THE
RECEIVER
REGISTERS
THAT
IT
RECEIVED
IT
A
GREEN
REMOTE
LIGHT
FLASHES
BUT
THE
RIGHT
FUNCTION
DOESNT
HAPPEN
IF
ANY
FUNCTION
AT
ALL
ALSO
STRANGE
WHEN
I
HIT
THE
MUTE
BUTTON
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
DISPLAY
PANEL
GOES
BLACK
YIKES
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
THAT
BEFORE
BEFORE
ALL
THE
STRANGENESS
STARTED
THE
SYSTEM
TURNED
ITSELF
OFF
AND
ON
AGAIN
BY
ITSELF
SOMETIMES
IT
WONT
PLAY
A
RADIO
STATION
SO
I
HAVE
TO
KINDA
TWIST
IT
YES
KINDA
FLEX
THE
MOTHERBOARD
CHASIS
FOR
IT
TO
GET
THE
RADIO
TUNING
BACK
THE
AUX
IN
FUNCTION
ALWAYS
WORKS
HOWEVER
IT
IS
INCONVENIENT
BUT
NOT
INCONVENIENT
ENOUGH
TO
PAY
AN
EXPENSIVE
REPAIR
FEE
WHILE
IM
NOT
A
HARDWARE
GUY
I
WONDER
IF
SOMETHING
AS
SIMPLE
AS
A
SURGE
SUPRESSOR
WILL
BE
A
QUICK
FIX
THE
STRANGE
THING
IS
THAT
THESE
SYMPTOMS
COME
AND
GO
SOMEONE
TOLD
ME
THIS
UNIT
SERIES
HAS
A
BAD
VOLTAGE
AMP
CHIP
ANYWAY
ARGHH
