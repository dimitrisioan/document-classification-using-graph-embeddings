i
was
wondering
if
people
had
any
good
uses
for
old
simms
i
have
a
bunch
of
them
for
the
apple
mac
and
i
know
lots
of
other
people
do
to
i
have
tried
to
sell
them
but
have
gotten
no
interest
so
if
you
have
an
inovative
use
or
want
to
buy
some
simms
i
would
be
very
interested
in
hearing
about
it
one
of
the
guys
at
work
takes
of
them
uses
cyanoacrylate
glue
to
make
five
fourwide
panels
then
constructs
a
box
with
bottom
to
use
as
a
pencil
holder
or
if
youve
got
some
entreprenuerial
sp
spirit
get
a
cheapy
clear
plastic
box
mount
the
simm
inside
and
sell
it
as
a
pet
simm
im
sure
there
are
plenty
of
suckers
out
there
who
would
go
for
it
