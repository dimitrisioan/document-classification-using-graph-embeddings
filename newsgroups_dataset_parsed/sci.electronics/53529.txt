I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
PEOPLE
HAD
ANY
GOOD
USES
FOR
OLD
SIMMS
I
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
THEM
FOR
THE
APPLE
MAC
AND
I
KNOW
LOTS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
DO
TO
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
SELL
THEM
BUT
HAVE
GOTTEN
NO
INTEREST
SO
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
INOVATIVE
USE
OR
WANT
TO
BUY
SOME
SIMMS
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
ABOUT
IT
ONE
OF
THE
GUYS
AT
WORK
TAKES
OF
THEM
USES
CYANOACRYLATE
GLUE
TO
MAKE
FIVE
FOURWIDE
PANELS
THEN
CONSTRUCTS
A
BOX
WITH
BOTTOM
TO
USE
AS
A
PENCIL
HOLDER
OR
IF
YOUVE
GOT
SOME
ENTREPRENUERIAL
SP
SPIRIT
GET
A
CHEAPY
CLEAR
PLASTIC
BOX
MOUNT
THE
SIMM
INSIDE

SELL
IT
AS
A
PET
SIMM

SURE
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
SUCKERS
OUT
THERE
WHO
WOULD
GO
FOR
IT
