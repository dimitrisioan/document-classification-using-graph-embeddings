WRITES
AFTER
A
CONSIDERABLE
AMOUNT
OF
RESEARCH
REVIEW
OF
DISCUSSIONS
ON
THIS
GROUP
AND
MAINLY
FRUITLESS
TIME
ON
BREADBOARDS
I
HAVE
DECIDED
THAT
THE
PATH
OF
LEAST
RESISTANCE
FOR
PROTOTYPING
MY
NOT
NECESSARILY
SOMEONE
ELSES
ELECTRONIC
DESIGNS
IS
WIRE
WRAPPING
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
BUT
BE
CAREFUL
WIRE
WRAPPING
INCREASES
A
LOT
THE
WIRING
CAPACITANCE
THAT
SHOULDNT
BE
A
PROBLEM
FOR
SLOW
APPLICATIONS
IE
A
FEW
MHZ
BUT
AS
FOR
QUICKER
ONES
AROUND
MHZ
I
DOUBT
THAT
IT
CAN
WORK
FORTUNATELY
WIREWRAPPING
IS
A
BETTER
WIRING
TECHNIQUE
THAN
MOST
AT
HIGH
FREQUENCIES
CRAY
COMPUTERS
UP
TO
THE
XMP
AT
LEAST
ALL
HAD
WIREWRAPPED
BACKPLANES
WIREWRAP
GETS
INTO
TROUBLE
AT
MUCH
HIGHER
FREQUENCIES
THAN
ANY
TTL
CAN
HANDLE
THE
INCREASE
OF
WIRING
CAPACITANCE
IS
NOT
REALLY
RELEVANT
YOU
HAVE
TO
USE
TRANSMISSION
LINE
TECHNIQUES
AND
THE
CAPACITANCE
IS
NO
PROBLEM
WHERE
CAN
I
GET
A
DECENT
WRAPPING
TOOL
ID
LIKE
TO
SPEND
LESS
THAN
FOR
AN
AC
POWERED
UNIT
INCLUDING
BIT
AND
SLEEVE
HAND
POWERED
IS
THE
BEST
THERE
ARE
GOOD
AC
POWERED
ONES
BUT
RATHER
EXPENSIVE
A
LOWCOST
ONE
DOESNT
WORK
VERY
WELL
HANDPOWERED
IS
A
TERRIBLE
CHOICE
IMHO
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
A
FIELD
MAINTENANCE
PERSON
WHO
WILL
DO
MAYBE
A
DOZEN
CONNECTIONS
AT
A
TIME
YOUR
HANDS
WILL
CRAMP
BATTERYPOWERED
WIREWRAP
GUNS
ARE
AVAILABLE
IN
THE
RANGE
AND
SO
ARE
THE
LITTLE
TWIDDLESTICK
MANUAL
TYPES
FOR
A
MODEST
PROJECT
OF
A
COUPLE
HUNDRED
CONNECTIONS
ID
PREFER
TO
BORROW
A
PROFESSIONAL
AC
UNIT
OR
A
PNEUMATIC
ONE
