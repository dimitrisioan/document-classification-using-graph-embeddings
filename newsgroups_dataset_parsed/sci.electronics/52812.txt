WRITES
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
ABOUT
RADAR
DECTECTORS
ALL
THEY
ARE
IS
A
PASSIVE
DEVICE
MUCH
LIKE
THE
RADIO
IN
YOUR
CAR
THEY
WORK
AS
AN
ANTENNA
PICKING
UP
THAT
RADAR
SIGNALS
THAT
THE
RADAR
GUN
SENDS
OUT
THEREFORE
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
WAY
OF
DETECTING
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
ANY
MORE
THAN
THERE
WOULD
BE
OF
DETECTING
WHETHER
SOME
ONE
HAD
A
RADIO
IN
THEIR
CAR
UNFORTUNATELY
YOURE
WRONG
ON
BOTH
COUNTS
THE
MOST
COMMON
METHOD
OF
IMPLEMENTING
A
TUNABLE
RECEIVER
IS
TO
HAVE
A
LOCAL
OSCILLATOR
THE
LOCAL
OSCILLATORS
FREQUENCY
CAN
BE
RADIATED
OUT
OF
THE
RECEIVER
VIA
THE
ANTENNA
UNLESS
THE
CIRCUIT
IS
DESIGNED
AND
CONSTRUCTED
WITH
GREAT
CARE
FOR
A
REFERENCE
ON
DETECTING
RADIOS
