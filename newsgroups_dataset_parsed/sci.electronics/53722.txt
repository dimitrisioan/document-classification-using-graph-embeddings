NAGLENETCOMCOM
JOHN
NAGLE
WRITES
GREAT
EXPLAINATION
HOWEVER
YOU
LEFT
OFF
ONE
DETAIL
WHY
DO
YOU
ALWAYS
SEE
THEM
AT
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
AT
FOSSIL
FUEL
PLANTS
AT
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
IT
IS
PREFERED
TO
RUN
THE
WATER
CLOSED
CYCLE
WHEREAS
FOSSIL
FUEL
PLANTS
CAN
IN
SOME
CASES
GET
AWAY
WITH
DUMPING
THE
HOT
WATER
AS
I
RECALL
THE
WATER
ISNT
AS
HOT
THERMODYNAMICALLY
IN
MANY
FOSSIL
FUEL
PLANTS
AND
OF
COURSE
THERE
IS
LESS
DANGER
OF
RADIOACTIVE
CONTAMINATION
ACTUALLY
THE
REASONS
YOU
DONT
SEE
SO
MANY
COOLING
TOWERS
AT
FOSSIL
PLANTS
ARE
FOSSIL
UNITS
MULTIPLE
UNITS
PER
PLANT
ARE
GENERALLY
SMALLER
THAN
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
MWE
SEEMED
TO
BE
A
VERY
POPULAR
SIZE
WHEN
MANY
FOSSIL
PLANTS
WERE
BUILT
THE
AVERAGE
NUCLEAR
PLANT
IS
MWE
MANY
FOSSIL
PLANTS
WERE
GRANDFATHERED
WHEN
WATER
DISCHARGE
REGULATIONS
WERE
ADOPTED
WHY
THOSE
OLD
DIRT
BURNERS
CANT
HARM
ANYTHING
LET
EM
GO
POWERED
DRAFT
COOLING
TOWERS
LOW
ENOUGH
TO
THE
GROUND
TO
BE
GENERALLY
NOT
VISIBLE
FROM
OFFSITE
ARE
QUITE
POPULAR
WITH
FOSSIL
PLANTS
FOSSIL
PLANTS
USED
TO
GET
MUCH
LESS
REGULATORY
ATTENTION
THAN
NUCLEARS
ACTUALLY
FOSSIL
FUEL
PLANTS
RUN
HOTTER
THAN
THE
USUAL
BOILINGWATER
REACTOR
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
THERES
A
GRIPE
IN
THE
INDUSTRY
THAT
NUCLEAR
POWER
USES
VINTAGE
STEAM
TECHNOLOGY
SO
ITS
MORE
IMPORTANT
IN
NUCLEAR
PLANTS
TO
GET
THE
COLD
END
OF
THE
SYSTEM
AS
COLD
AS
POSSIBLE
HENCE
BIG
COOLING
TOWERS
OIL
AND
GAS
FIRED
STEAM
PLANTS
ALSO
HAVE
CONDENSERS
BUT
THEY
USUALLY
ARE
SIZED
TO
GET
THE
STEAM
BACK
INTO
HOT
WATER
NOT
MOST
OF
THE
WAY
DOWN
TO
AMBIENT
SOME
PLANTS
DO
COOL
THE
CONDENSERS
WITH
WATER
RATHER
THAN
AIR
AS
ONE
CANADIAN
OFFICIAL
ASKED
ABOUT
THERMAL
POLLUTION
DEICING
A
RIVER
SAID
UP
HERE
WE
VIEW
HEAT
AS
A
RESOURCE
ACTUALLY
THE
CONDENSING
ENVIRONMENT
IS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
FOR
PLANTS
OF
SIMILAR
SIZE
THE
ISSUES
ARE
THE
SAME
REGARDLESS
OF
WHERE
THE
HEAT
COMES
FROM
CONDENSERS
ARE
RUN
AT
AS
HIGH
A
VACUUM
AS
POSSIBLE
IN
ORDER
TO
REDUCE
AERODYNAMIC
DRAG
ON
THE
TURBINE
THE
CONDENSER
PRESSURE
IS
NORMALLY
WATERS
VAPOR
PRESSURE
AT
THE
CONDENSING
TEMPERATURE
IT
IS
DESIRABLE
THAT
THE
STEAM
EXHAUST
BE
FREE
OF
WATER
DROPLETS
BECAUSE
MOISTURE
IN
THE
STEAM
CAUSES
SEVERE
EROSION
DAMAGE
TO
THE
TURBINE
LOW
PRESSURE
BLADES
AND
BECAUSE
ENTRAINED
WATER
MOVING
AT
HIGH
VELOCITY
CAUSES
EROSION
OF
THE
CONDENSER
TUBES
THE
COLDEST
AND
THUS
LOWEST
PRESSURE
CONDENSING
ENVIRONMENT
IS
ALWAYS
THE
BEST
A
RELATED
ISSUE
IS
THAT
OF
PUMPING
THE
CONDENSATE
FROM
THE
HOTWELL
WHERE
THE
WATER
ENDS
UP
AFTER
DRIPPING
OFF
THE
CONDENSER
TUBES
SINCE
THE
CONDENSER
IS
AT
A
VERY
LOW
PRESSURE
THE
ONLY
FORCE
DRIVING
THE
CONDENSATE
INTO
THE
HOTWELL
PUMPS
IS
GRAVITY
IF
THE
CONDENSATE
IS
TOO
HOT
OR
THE
GRAVITY
HEAD
IS
TOO
LOW
THE
CONDENSATE
WILL
REFLASH
INTO
STEAM
BUBBLES
AND
CAUSE
THE
CONDENSATE
PUMPS
TO
CAVITATE
THIS
IS
A
PARTICULARLY
DESTRUCTIVE
FORM
OF
CAVITATION
THAT
IS
TO
BE
AVOIDED
AT
ALL
COSTS
THE
HOTWELL
PUMPS
ARE
LOCATED
IN
THE
LOWEST
POINT
IN
THE
PLANT
IN
ORDER
TO
PROVIDE
A
GRAVITY
HEAD
TO
THE
PUMPS
HOW
MUCH
LOWER
THEY
MUST
BE
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
HOW
HOT
THE
WATER
IS
ALLOWED
TO
GET
IN
THE
HOTWELL
TYPICALLY
HOTWELL
TEMPERATURES
RUN
BETWEEN
AND
DEGREES
DEPENDING
ON
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
RIVER
WATER
THIS
TERM
IS
USED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
RIVER
GRADE
WATER
EVEN
WHEN
THE
COOLING
TOWER
SYSTEM
IS
OPERATING
IN
CLOSED
LOOP
MODE
AND
ESSENTIALLY
NO
RIVER
WATER
IS
PUMPED
WHEN
THE
RIVER
WATER
TEMPERATURE
IS
HIGH
IN
THE
SUMMER
OPERATORS
WILL
TYPICALLY
ALLOW
THE
HOTWELL
LEVEL
TO
RISE
IN
ORDER
TO
PROVIDE
MORE
GRAVITY
HEAD
THERE
IS
A
TRADEOFF
INVOLVED
SINCE
HIGHER
HOTWELL
LEVELS
WILL
ENCROACH
ONTO
THE
CONDENSING
TUBES
AND
REDUCE
THE
CONDENSER
AREA
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
EAST
AND
ELSEWHERE
WHERE
MOISTURE
ACTUALLY
EXISTS
IN
THE
AIR
THE
RIVER
WATER
WILL
ALMOST
ALWAYS
BE
COOLER
THAN
THE
DISCHARGE
WATER
FROM
THE
COOLING
TOWERS
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
THE
DISCHARGE
WATER
FROM
THE
COOLING
TOWERS
IS
SET
BY
THE
AMBIENT
AIR
TEMPERATURE
AND
HUMIDITY
IT
IS
VERY
RARE
IN
THE
EAST
TO
HEAR
OF
ACTUAL
RIVER
WATER
TEMPERATURES
EXCEEDING
DEGREES
A
VAST
DIFFERENCE
FROM
THE
TYPICAL
DAYS
DEGREES
HUMIDITY
WE
SEE
ROUTINELY
IN
THE
EAST
IT
IS
NOT
UNUSUAL
PARTICULARLY
WHERE
THE
ECONAZIS
HAVE
BEEN
SUCCESSFUL
IN
CLAMPING
RIGID
DISCHARGE
WATER
TEMPERATURE
LIMITS
ON
A
PLANT
FOR
THE
PLANT
TO
HAVE
TO
REDUCE
THE
FIRING
RATE
WHEN
THE
AIR
TEMPERATURE
GETS
TOO
HIGH
AND
THE
CONDENSER
CANNOT
HANDLE
THE
HEAT
LOAD
WITHOUT
EXCESSIVE
PRESSURE
EVERYBODY
RUNS
CLOSEDCYCLE
BOILERS
THE
WATER
USED
IS
PURIFIED
OF
SOLIDS
WHICH
OTHERWISE
CRUD
UP
THE
BOILER
PLUMBING
WHEN
THE
WATER
BOILS
PURIFYING
WATER
FOR
BOILER
USE
IS
A
BIGGER
JOB
THAN
COOLING
IT
SO
THE
BOILER
WATER
IS
RECYCLED
TRUE
ACTUALLY
SECONDARY

THE
PART
THAT
MAKES

AND
FEEDS

TO
THE

CHEMISTRY
HAS
BEEN
THE
BASTARD

HAS
NOT
GOTTEN

DESERVES

JUST
IN
