telcom
wiring
questionneed
help
ive
got
two
lines
coming
into
my
apartment
two
different
telephone
numbers
when
i
ordered
the
second
line
installed
instead
of
bringing
out
another
wire
bundle
the
telco
just
connected
up
to
my
yellow
and
black
wires
so
i
have
one
line
on
red
green
and
the
other
on
yellow
black
today
i
was
monitoring
the
voltage
on
both
lines
i
had
a
voltmeter
across
the
red
and
green
and
read
back
volts
i
then
lifted
up
the
receiver
on
my
second
lineblack
yellow
wires
the
voltage
dropped
to
volts
on
the
first
line
red
green
wires
i
repeated
this
experiment
with
the
second
linemonitoring
black
yellow
and
lifting
the
handset
off
the
cradle
on
the
red
and
green
line
it
also
dropped
to
volts
why
is
this
i
thought
these
were
separate
lines
next
i
went
to
the
block
and
disconnected
the
blue
and
white
lines
coming
in
from
the
telco
cable
i
then
disconnected
all
the
phones
in
my
apartment
and
went
back
to
the
block
and
did
some
resistance
measurements
both
lines
read
open
ill
appreciate
any
help
on
this
is
this
considered
normal
guy
