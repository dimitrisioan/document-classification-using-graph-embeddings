listen
to
the
interference
if
you
hear
voices
clearly
it
almost
certainly
isnt
ham
radio
and
might
well
be
cb
if
you
can
record
a
bit
of
it
you
could
take
the
tape
over
to
a
local
ham
operators
house
and
ask
him
for
his
opinion
of
what
youre
hearing
most
communities
you
cannot
do
that
legally
why
cant
he
record
it
legally
it
may
not
be
admissable
in
court
but
recording
for
personal
use
is
legal
if
he
wants
to
play
it
for
his
ham
friend
thats
legal
too
as
long
as
he
doesnt
charge
admission
unfortunately
most
consumer
equipment
is
succeptable
it
is
all
poorly
designed
here
here
btw
hams
are
allowed
amplifiers
cb
isnt
illegal
ham
amplifier
doesnt
compute
it
does
but
not
for
a
mobile
radio
there
are
very
few
mobile
rigs
that
could
power
a
watt
amplifier
bill
it
doesnt
actually
have
to
be
watts
at
feet
ive
heard
radio
transmissions
from
concert
security
over
guitar
amps
with
no
guitar
plugged
in
and
security
uses
radios
transmitting
watts
into
a
rubber
duck
antenna
which
acts
more
like
a
dummy
load
than
an
antenna
hey
bill
where
were
you
three
weeks
ago
when
all
this
stuff
was
posted
and
dealt
with
galen
watts
