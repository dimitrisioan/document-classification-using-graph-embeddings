VHS
TAPE
HI
FOLKS
I
BORROWED
A
VHS
TAPE
FROM
A
FRIEND
AND
IT
HAS
A
WARNING
IN
THE
BEGINING
SAYING
THAT
ATTEMPTS
TO
COPY
THE
TAPE
WILL
RESULT
IN
DESTROYING
THE
COPY
AND
THE
ORIGINAL
I
FOUND
THIS
UNBELIEVABLE
AS
PLAYING
AND
RECORDING
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
PROCESSES
HOWEVER
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
THIS
TAPE
BEING
SOLD
ANYWHERE
SO
I
DONT
WANT
TO
TAKE
THE
CHANCE
EVEN
ITS
SMALL
ANYONE
HAS
EXPERIENCE
IN
THIS
KIND
OF
SELFDESTRUCTING

THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
