negative
logic
high
this
may
sound
like
a
simpleminded
question
but
this
is
the
first
time
ive
ever
had
a
need
for
this
ive
been
designing
some
relatively
simple
chip
circuits
based
on
things
like
photoresistors
you
know
no
light
to
photoresistor
emit
a
logic
high
etc
anyway
ive
got
some
servos
lying
around
and
i
wanted
to
do
some
things
with
them
using
digital
logic
i
know
all
about
having
to
pulse
the
signal
and
everything
i
just
have
one
problem
im
assuming
i
need
a
negative
yes
negative
logic
high
to
get
the
thing
to
turn
in
the
direction
opposite
the
direction
it
would
turn
under
normal
logic
high
is
a
negative
logic
high
ive
seen
this
in
schematics
the
same
thing
as
an
active
low
or
what
im
not
using
a
bipolar
power
source
so
how
would
i
get
a
negative
logic
high
out
of
this
thing
i
need
to
have
all
three
signals
available
logic
high
logic
low
and
negative
logic
high
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
also
please
reply
via
email
as
i
never
seem
to
have
time
to
read
this
or
any
other
group
lately
thanks
much
mark
