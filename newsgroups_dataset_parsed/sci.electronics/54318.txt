I
KNOW
THIS
IS
A
LONG
SHOT
BUT
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
SOLVENT
I
SHOULD
USE
TO
CLEAN
DUCTTAPE
ADHESIVE
FROM
CARPET
SOMEONE
TAPED
WIRES
TO
THE
CARPET
AND
NOW
IT
IS
TIME
TO
MOVE
OUT
I
DONT
KNOW
FOR
SURE
THAT
THIS
WILL
WORK
BUT
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
MEK
METHYL
ETHYL
KEYTONE
IT
WORKED
GETTING
THE
STICKUM
LEFT
OVER
FROM
SHELF
PAPER
AND
IS
AVAILABLE
AT
PAINT
STORES
USE
A
CARBON
GAS
MASK
AND
LOTS
OF
VENTILATIONTHIS
STUFF
REALLY
STINKS
DAN
FOR
THOSE
WHO
DONT
KNOW
METHYL
ETHYL
KETONE
IS
MORE
COMMONLY
KNOWN
AS
ACETONE
AND
CAN
BE
FOUND
AS
THE
MAJOR
ACTIVE
INGREDIENT
IN
NAIL
POLISH
REMOVER
YOUR
WIFES
PROBABLY
GOT
SOME
HANGIN
AROUND
OH
DEAR
TIME
FOR
ME
TO
TRY
TO
REMEMBER
MY
CHEMISTRY
LETS
SEE
IF
I
CAN
FIND
THE
FORMULAE
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
DIM
RECESSES
OF
MY
MIND
SOUNDS
OF

FUMES
OF
OVERHEATED
OIL
UNMISTAKABLE
STENCH
OF
THE
NASAL
CHROMATOGRAPH
HA
I
KNEW
THERE
WAS
A
DOUBLE
BOND
NOW
HOW
SHALL
I
SHOW
THAT
IN
ASCII
MEK
ACETONE
C

O

THE
HYDROGENS
ARE
NOT
SHOWN
AND
REPRESENTS
DOUBLE
BOND
MEK
HAS
A
METHYL
ON
ONE
SIDE
AND
AN
ETHYL
ON
THE
OTHER
ACETONE
HAS
TWO
METHYLS
SO
ACETONE
IS
NOT
METHYL
ETHYL
KETONE
BUT
INSTEAD
IS
DIMETHYL
KETONE
BOTH
SOLVENTS
HAVE
SIMILAR
PROPERTIES
I
THINK
THAT
MEK
MAY
BE
A
LITTLE
LESS
FLAMMABLE
BUT
A
LOT
WORSE
TO
BREATHE
ITS
A
LOT
HARDER
TO
BUY
MEK
THAN
IT
ONCE
WAS
USE
ACETONE
NAIL
POLISH
REMOVER
CONSISTS
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
OF
ACETONE
IF
YOU
BUY
SOME
FOR
YOUR
WORKSHOP
GET
THE
VERY
CHEAPEST
BECAUSE
THE
MORE
EXPENSIVE
KIND
HAS
OILS
AND
PERFUMES
THAT
YOU
DONT
NEED
NOTHING
IS
SO
FOOLISH
THAT
IT
HAS
NOT
