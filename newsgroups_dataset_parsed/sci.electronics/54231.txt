RE
HOW
UNIVERSAL
ARE
PHONES
THESE
DAYS
IN
ARTICLE
JOAKIM
GUNNARSSON
WRITES
TWO
THINGS
TO
WATCH
FOR
IN
GERMANY
AND
I
THINK
THE
SAME
HOLDS
FOR
SWEDEN
ONLY
SOME
OF
THE
CONNECTIONS
CAN
HANDLE
TONE
DIALING
SO
MAKE
SURE
THE
PHONE
CAN
BE
SET
TO
PULSE
DIALING
IN
SWEDEN
THE
IS
THE
FIRST
DIGIT
AND
ALL
OTHER
DIGITS
ARE
PUSHED
DOWN
BY
ONE
POSITION
THIS
MAKES
DIALING
AND
IN
THE
PROCESS
CONVERTING
NUMBERS
AN
INTERESTING
TASK
I
THINK
ALL
CONNECTIONS
IN
NORWAY
CAN
HANDLE
TOUCHTONE
DIALING
NOT
TO
TOUCHTONE
BTW
NORWAY
IS
EVEN
MORE
INTERESTING
THEY
GOT
BOTH
SYSTEM
SO
YOU
NEED
DIFFERENT
PHONES
DEPENDING
ON
WHERE
IN
THE
COUNTRY
YOU
LIVE
THE
OSLOREGION
HAS
ONE
SYSTEM
THE
REST
OF
THE
COUNTRY
ANOTHER
SYSTEM
SO
YOU
NEED
DIFFERENT
PHONES
DEPENDING
ON
WHERE
IN
THE
COUNTRY
YOU
LIVE
ALMOST
RIGHT
FOR
PULSDIALING
SOME
PHONES
HAVE
A
LITTLE
SWITCH
INSIDE
SO
YOU
ARE
ABLE
TO
USE
THEM
ALL
OVER
NORWAY
OR
YOU
CAN
JUST
RENUMBER
THE
NUMBERS
ON
YOUR
PHONE
