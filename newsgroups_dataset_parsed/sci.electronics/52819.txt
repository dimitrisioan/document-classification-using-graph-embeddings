re
police
radarjust
how
does
it
work
the
father
of
a
friend
of
mine
is
a
police
officer
in
west
virginia
not
only
is
his
word
as
a
skilled
observer
good
in
court
but
his
skill
as
an
observer
has
been
tested
to
be
more
accurate
than
the
radar
gun
in
some
cases
no
foolin
he
can
guess
a
cars
speed
to
within
just
by
watching
it
blow
by
whether
hes
standing
still
or
moving
too
yes
how
was
this
testing
done
and
how
many
times
calibrated
speedometer
its
not
the
some
cases
that
worry
me
its
the
other
cases
eg
suboptimal
viewing
conditions
even
the
best
subjective
viewer
can
only
partial
compensate
for
certain
distortions
and
optical
illusions
