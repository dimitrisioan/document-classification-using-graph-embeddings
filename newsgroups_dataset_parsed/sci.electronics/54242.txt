i
am
interested
in
finding
a
supplier
for
an
array
of
leds
on
material
which
is
transparent
when
nothing
is
lit
im
not
quite
sure
what
lcd
screens
are
like
away
from
the
laptop
but
i
would
guess
they
are
not
too
clear
an
ideal
item
would
be
an
led
array
for
which
each
led
is
about
square
yes
very
course
this
is
for
distance
viewing
but
on
a
window
any
pointers
of
suggestions
would
be
much
appreciated
what
pray
tell
are
you
putting
together
and
what
about
costs
and
does
it
have
to
be
transparent
as
in
totally
transparent
or
just
transparent
enough
to
allow
light
from
the
other
side
to
shine
through
