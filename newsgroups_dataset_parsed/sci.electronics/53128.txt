PRACTICAL
QUESTIONS
WAS
PHILOSOPHICAL
QUESTION
IN
ARTICLE
JIM
CARR
WRITES
I
AGREE
I
COME
AT
THIS
FROM
NUCLEAR
PHYSICS
WHERE
ONE
OFTEN
DISCUSSES
PARTICLEHOLE
EXCITATIONS
AND
CERTAIN
REACTIONS
HAVE
THE
EFFECT
OF
APPLYING
AN
ANNIHILATION
OPERATOR
AND
CREATING
A
HOLE
AND
IT
IS
A
SUBTLE
QUESTION
THE
LONGER
ONE
WORKS
WITH
THEM
THE
MORE
REAL
THEY
BECOME
THERE
ARE
ALSO
QUASIPARTICLES
WHICH
RAISE
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
QUESTION
ABOUT
HOW
REAL
THE
ENTITY
IS
THE
PHENOMENON
IS
MOST
CERTAINLY
A
REAL
ONE
OK
IVE
ASKED
THIS
BEFORE
AND
WITH
A
NEW
THREAD
ON
THESE
LINES
I
ASK
THIS
AGAIN
IF
A
LARGE
HOLE
CURRENT
IS
RUN
THRU
A
RESISTOR
WILL
THERE
BE
R
COOLING
INSTEAD
OF
HEATING
CAN
ANYONE
DESIGN
AN
AMPLIFIER
THAT
PREFERENTIALLY
AMPLIFIES
HOLE
CURRENTS
OVER
NORMAL
ELECTRON
CURRENTS
WHAT
SEMICONDUCTOR
MATERIALS
HAVE
THE
HIGHEST
RATIO
OF
HOLE
MOBILITY
TO
ELECTRON
MOBILITY
PLEASE
QUOTE
ACTUAL
TEST
SAMPLES
RATHER
THAN
ESTIMATES
BASED
ON
THEORY
ALSO
DONT
BE
LIMITED
TO
SEMICONDUCTORS
CONSIDER
ALSO
INSULATORS
RESISTORS
DIELECTRICS
PIEZOELECTRICS
CONDUCTORS
MAGNETS
METAL
CERAMIC
MAGNETOSTRICTIVES
ETC
NOTES
TO
SUMMARIZE
THIS
THREAD
HAS
SO
FAR
STATED
THAT
THE
ONLY
AREA
WHERE
HOLES
ARE
NOT
DETECTABLE
IS
THE
VACUUM
THAT
IS
HOLE
PARTICLES
ONLY
EXIST
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
MATTER
PREVIOUS
THREADS
HAVE
STATED
THAT
HOLES
ONLY
EXIST
IN
CERTAIN
SEMICONDUCTORS
THE
QUESTION
THAT
NATURALLY
ARISES
IS
IF
THE
HOLE
CURRENTS
INSIDE
A
SEMICONDUCTOR
VANISH
AT
THE
POINT
WHERE
THE
SEMICONDUCTOR
IS
JOINED
TO
A
CONDUCTOR
SAY
COPPER
I
DONT
WANT
A
THEORETICAL
DISCUSSION
HERE
ABOUT
WHETHER
HOLES
COULD
EXIST
INSIDE
METAL
CONDUCTORS
RATHER
I
ASK
FOR
AN
EXPERIMENTAL
DISCUSSION
ON
HOW
TO
AMPLIFY
AND
DETECT
SUCH
CURRENTS
IF
THEY
EXIST
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
I
HAVE
CROSSPOSTED
THIS
TO
SCIELECTRONICS
SINCE
THIS
IS
NOW
BECOMING
AN
ELECTRONIC
DISCUSSION
THANX
ERIC
ET
A
FORCE
OF
NATURE
