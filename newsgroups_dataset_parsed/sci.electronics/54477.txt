re
microcontroller
questions
for
newcomer
does
anyone
have
recommendations
on
whether
a
smart
data
io
print
spooler
digital
sampling
etc
would
be
better
implemented
with
a
dma
chip
or
a
dedicated
microcontroller
essentially
what
i
am
trying
to
decide
is
the
best
way
to
handle
moving
data
from
a
port
with
automatic
handshaking
from
or
to
a
memory
area
that
will
be
accessible
by
a
main
system
processor
when
not
in
use
by
the
smart
data
io
which
dma
or
microcontroller
chip
would
be
best
to
use
fast
cheap
and
easy
to
obtain
would
be
nice
but
i
wont
limit
my
choices
to
only
those
that
fit
those
characteristics
even
an
under
would
do
what
i
want
but
i
am
sure
there
is
a
better
alternative
like
a
microcontroller
with
onchip
eeprom
so
i
essentially
want
to
hear
about
all
dma
and
microcontrollers
that
are
simple
to
interface
and
will
move
data
from
one
place
to
another
while
monitoring
a
few
io
lines
