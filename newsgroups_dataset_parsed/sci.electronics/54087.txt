RE

CHEAP
PRODUCTS
MUCH
DELETED
ABOUT
ASSEMBLY
IN
USA
VS
OTHER
I
WISH
TO
FOCUS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
WARMRUNNING
AMPLIFIERS
SURE
THE
AMP
RUNS
VERY
FAIRLY
HOT
BUT
THATS
HOW
YOU
GET
AN
AMP
TO
SOUND
INCREDIBLY
GOOD
AN
AMP
THAT
RUNS
HOT
HAS
NO
BEARING
ON
HOW
ITS
GONNA
SOUND
THE
AMP
YOU
HAVE
PROBABLY
IS
RUNNING
CLASSA
THE
WHOLE
DAY
BECAUSE
EITHER
THE
ENGINEER
OR
MANUFACTURER
OF
THAT
AMP
WANTED
TO
SKIMP
ON
HEATSINKING
OR
COOLING
TO
SAVE
COSTS
HMMMMM
THERE
IS
A
CORRECLATION
BETWEEN
WARMRUNNING
AMPS
AND
GOOD
SOUND
OR
IN
YOUR
WORDS
IT
DOES
HAVE
A
BEARING
ON
NOW
I
DONT
SUGGEST
THAT
EVERYONE
RUN
OUT
AND
CREATE
COMBINATION
STOVEAMPLIFIERS
THAT
WILL
DEGRADE
LIFESPAN
BUT
A
COLDRUNNING
CIRCUIT
IS
MUCH
MORE
SUCEPTIBLE
TO
TEMPERATURE
VARIATION
WITH
VARRYING
CURRENT
THAN
IS
A
WARMRUNNING
ONE
AND
SINCE
JUNCTION
RESISTANCE
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
TEMPERATURE
THIS
HAS
A
DETRIMENTAL
EFFECT
ON

FORTUNATELY
THE
