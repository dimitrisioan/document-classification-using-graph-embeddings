I
BELIEVE
THAT
PERSISTENCE
OVERCOMES
EVEN
THE
VERY
BEST
COPY
PROTECTION
SCHEMES
I
WOULD
EXPECT
THAT
CDROM
SOFTWARE
WOULD
NOT
EVEN
NEED
COPY
PROTECTION
AS
THE
PROGRAM
ON
A
CDROM
WOULD
NOT
FIT
ONTO
A
HARDDRIVE
AND
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
THE
AVERAGE
AND
EVEN
NOTSOAVERAGE
USER
TO
WRITE
TO
A
CDROM
COPIES
OF
THE
SOFTWARE
THAT
STILL
WORK
COULD
NEVER
BE
MADE
HMMM
NOW
THAT
I
THINK
ABOUT
IT
WITH
A
CREATIVE
TSR
MAYBE
DISKSWAPPING
COULD
BE
USED
TO
SIMULATE
FILES
ON
A
SINGLE
DISK
YOU
WOULD
NEED
A
TONNE
OF
DISKS
