believe

persistence
overcomes
even
the
very
best
copy
protection
schemes
i
would
expect
that
cdrom
software
would
not
even
need
copy
protection
as
the
program
on
a
cdrom
would
not
fit
onto
a
harddrive
and
it
is
impossible
for
the
average
and
even
notsoaverage
user
to
write
to
a
cdrom
copies
of
the
software
that
still
work
could
never
be
made
hmmm
now
that
i
think
about
it
with
a
creative
tsr
maybe
diskswapping
could
be
used
to
simulate
files
on
a
single
disk
you
would
need
a
tonne
of
disks
though
