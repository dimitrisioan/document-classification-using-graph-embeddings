RE
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
OLD
SIMMS
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
PEOPLE
HAD
ANY
GOOD
USES
FOR
OLD
SIMMS
I
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
THEM
FOR
THE
APPLE
MAC
AND
I
KNOW
LOTS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
DO
TO
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
SELL
THEM
BUT
HAVE
GOTTEN
NO
INTEREST
HOW
HARD
WOULD
IT
BE
TO
SOMEHOW
INTERFACE
THEM
TO
SOME
OF
THE
POPULAR
MOTOROLA
MICROCONTROLLERS
I
AM
A
NOVICE
AT
MICROCONTROLLERS
BUT
I
AM
STARTING
TO
GET
INTO
THEM
FOR
SOME
OF
MY
PROJECTS
I
HAVE
SEVERAL
SIMMS
LAYING
AROUND
FROM
UPGRADED
MACS
AND
IF
I
COULD
USE
THEM
AS
FREE
MEMORY
IN
ONE
OR
TWO
OF
MY
PROJECTS
THAT
WOULD
BE
GREAT
ONE
PROJECT
THAT
COMES
TO
MIND
IS
A
CALLER
ID
DEVICE
THAT
WOULD
REQUIRE
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
RAM
TO
STORE
SEVERAL
