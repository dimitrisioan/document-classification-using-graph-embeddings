i
was
having
a
look
through
a
couple
of
components
catalogues
when
i
came
across
a
range
of
peltier
effect
heat
pumps
intended
for
cooling
components
for
those
who
have
not
heard
of
this
effect
you
put
a
current
through
one
of
these
devices
and
it
pumps
heat
from
one
side
to
the
other
reverse
the
current
and
you
reverse
the
effect
i
think
a
temperature
difference
can
give
you
an
emf
as
well
anyway
it
struck
me
that
you
could
make
a
nice
coolhot
box
for
picnics
with
one
of
these
a
power
regulator
a
thermostat
and
a
couple
of
heat
sinks
the
biggest
device
can
shift
with
an
efficiency
of
which
aint
bad
although
it
would
flatten
my
car
battery
in
about
half
an
hour
socalled
coolhot
boxes
have
been
advetised
for
several
years
i
recall
damark
advertising
them
in
a
recent
catalog
problem
with
the
units
is
they
do
a
shy
job
of
keeping
food
coldwarm
the
peliter
devices
used
just
dont
seem
to
have
enough
punch
to
keep
up
if
you
want
something
hot
you
need
to
heat
it
up
before
you
put
it
in
the
box
and
end
up
hours
later
with
food
thats
only
moderately
warm
same
goes
for
cold
items
unfortunately
the
catalogue
didnt
list
anything
more
than
the
basic
specs
as
a
heat
pump
i
imagine
that
you
would
get
a
backemf
as
the
temperature
gradient
across
the
device
increases
if
so
presumably
its
power
decreases
as
the
backemf
increases
until
eventually
we
have
a
steady
state
with
no
current
being
consumed
assuming
no
leakage
if
so
then
the
final
temperature
difference
between
the
two
sides
could
be
set
by
the
supply
voltage
and
nothing
more
although
that
would
be
a
lousy
way
to
control
it
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
are
the
above
guesses
correct
what
is
the
opencircuit
thermal
resistance
of
a
typical
device
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
my
coolbox
is
not
going
to
get
warm
too
fast
when
i
unplug
it
youde
probably
be
better
off
getting
a
good
colemantm
cooler
and
stocking
up
on
blue
ice
blocks
how
does
a
peltier
effect
heat
pump
actually
work
it
looks
like
magic
why
dont
they
use
these
things
in
domestic
fridgesfreezers
same
as
above
not
enough
punch
in
them
to
keepget
things
coldhot
thanks
in
advance
