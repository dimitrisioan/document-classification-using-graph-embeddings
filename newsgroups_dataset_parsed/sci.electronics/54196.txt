hi
folks
i
borrowed
a
vhs
tape
from
a
friend
and
it
has
a
warning
in
the
begining
sayi
that
attempts
to
copy
the
tape
will
result
in
destroying
the
copy
and
the
original
i
found
this
unbelievable
as
playing
and
recording
are
two
differen
processes
however
ive
never
seen
this
tape
being
sold
anywhere
so
i
dont
want
to
take
the
chance
even
its
small
greetings
there
are
types
of
warnings
on
us
tapes
a
hologram
is
glued
across
the
seam
of
the
halves
of
the
tape
the
message
usually
reads
if
seal
is
broken
you
must
buy
this
tape
the
standard
macrovision
warning
copies
of
this
tape
will
be
unviewable
your
case
extended
message
for
the
average
consumer
tm
which
states
that
even
attempting
to
copy
the
tape
will
destroy
the
original
i
dont
believe
you
can
sue
them
for
misinformation
in
cases
like
this
take
care
ps
of
course
is
utter
bs
but
the
average
consumer
tm
believes
it
heck
my
mom
once
returned
such
a
tape
without
watching
it
she
was
afraid
that
something
might
just
happen
