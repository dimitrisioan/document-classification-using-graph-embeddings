HI
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
SOME
HELP
IN
CHOOSING
A
PACKAGE
FOR
A
HIGHSPEED
SILICON
ADC
CURRENTLY
BEING
FABRICATED
THIS
IS
A
PHD
RESEARCH
PROJECT
AND
I
HAVE
TO
TEST
THE
CHIP
AT
SPEED
ON
A
PCB
I
EXPECT
TO
HAVE
ROUGHLY
PACKAGED
CIRCUITS
AND
WILL
DO
DC
LOWSPEED
AND
HIGHSPEED
TESTING
USING
DIFFERENT
SETUPS
FOR
THE
TEST
CHIP
I
KNOW
FOR
SURE
THAT
A
DIP
WILL
NOT
WORK
THE
LONG
LEAD
LINES
HAVE
TOO
HIGH
AN
INDUCTANCE
GETTING
A
CUSTOMMADE
PACKAGE
IS
TOO
EXPENSIVE
SO
I
AM
TRYING
TO
CHOOSE
BETWEEN
A
FLATPAK
AND
A
LEADLESS
CHIP
CARRIER
THE
FLATPACK
WOULD
BE
HARD
TO
TEST
SINCE
IT
HAS
TO
BE
SOLDERED
ON
TO
THE
TEST
SETUP
AND
I
WOULD
SPEND
LOADS
OF
TIME
SOLDERING
AS
I
KEPT
CHANGING
THE
TEST
CHIP
THE
LEADLESS
CHIP
CARRIER
SOCKETS
ALSO
HAVE
LONG
LEAD
LINES
AND
MAY
NOT
WORK
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
DOES
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
HAVE
EXPERIENCEKNOWLEDGE
OF
THIS
FIELD
I
WOULD
GREATLY
APPRECIATE

THE
LATEST

IS
DATED
THAT
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
BIBLES
IN

DESIGN
THE
VERY
FACT
THAT
YOU
NEED
TO
BUILD
A
TEST
FIXTURE
MEANS
YOURE
MOST
LIKELY
GOING
TO
NEED
A
SOCKET
IT
IN
ITSELF
HAS
FAR
MORE
INDUCTANCE
PER
PIN
THAN
THE
PACKAGE
YOU
ARE
TESTING
NOT
TO
MENTION
ANY
IMPEDANCE
DISCONTINUITIES
I
DONT
SEE
THE
BIG
CONCERN
OVER
THE
PACKAGING
BECAUSE
IT
PROBABLY
ISNT
GOING
TO
MAKE
THAT
MUCH
DIFFERENCE
