LCD
DISPLAYS
SCIEE

REQUIRES
AN
LCD
DISPLAY

OF
THE
ANALOG
ELECTRONICS
ARE
WORKING
FINE
I
HAVE
ORDERED
A
PIC
ICE
NOT
VICE
VERSA
SINCE
THE
PICS
ARE
SO
CHEAP
AND
LOWPOWER
BUT
I
AM
HAVING
A
DEVIL
OF
A
TIME
FINDING
ANY
LCD
DISPLAYS
IN
THE
DIGIT
RANGE
THAT
ARE
PRICED
AS
LOW
AS
I
NEED
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
SOMTHING
IN
THE
RANGE
OF
IN
QUANTITIES
OF
ABOUT
MAINSTREAM
DISTRIBUTORS
LIKE
ALMAC

HELP
ME
WITHOUT
A

OR
WHEN
THEY
DO
LOOK
AROUND
FOR
SOMETHING
IN
THEIR
LINE
THEY
FIND
A
LCD
EVEN
DIGIKEYS
CHEAPEST
OFFERING
IS
IN
QUANTITY
I
KNOW
LCD
DISPLAYS
LIKE
THIS
MUST
EXIST
BECAUSE
I
SEE
WHOLE
CALCULATORS
FOR
SALE
FOR
MEANING
THE
RETAILER
PROBABLY
BUYS
IT
FOR
AND
THE
WHOLESALER
PROBABLY
GETS
IT
FOR
OR
SO
THIS
INCLUDES
ASSEMBLY
LABOR
PACKAGING
SALES
TRANSPORTATION
IMPORT
DUTIES
THE
CASE
AND
KEYBOARD
THE
PC
BOARD
THE
PROCESSOR
CHIP
THE
SOLAR
CELL
AND
THE
LCD
THE
LCD
CANT
COST
MUCH
IF
ANYONE
COULD
PUT
ME
IN
TOUCH
WITH
SOME
MANUFACTURERS
ANDOR
DISTRIBUTORS
THAT
HANDLE
SUCH
THINGS
