whats

all

variations
were

something
with

the
question
arises
well
do

i
posted
about
this
a
few
years
ago
its
not
fully
up
to
date
with
all
the
new
variations
some
of
which
are
just
different
manufacturers
synonyms
in
practical
terms
ignoring
the
technological
details
this
is
my
view
of
the
families
nb
i
am
not
a
giant
corporation
which
influences
my
views
on
things
like
availability
and
backward
compatibility
the
original
speed
good
power
consumption
fair
effectively
obsolete
now
use
or
later
except
for
a
very
few
oddball
functions
like
which
are
hard
to
find
in
newer
families

at
the

very

modification

at

very

at

now

of

not

the
clear

for
high

in

availability
and
prices
generally
good
failed
competitor
to
although
a
few
parts
do
things
that
are
hard
to
find
in
and
thus
are
still
useful
possible
replacement
for
generally
souped
up
still
fairly
new
availability
and
prices
possibly
a
problem
fairly
old
family
cmos
devices
with
ttl
pinouts
competed
with
series
not
too
successfully
obsolete
use
or
newer
cmos
families
thrown
in
as
the
major
nonecl
logic
family
the
old
cmos
family
still
viable
because
of
very
wide
range
of
devices
low
power
consumption
and
wide
range
of
supply
voltages
not
fast
very
forgiving
and
easy
to
work
with
beware
static
electricity
but
that
comment
applies
to
many
other
modern
logic
families
too
there
are
neat
devices
in
this
family
that
exist
in
no
other
the
clear
choice
when
speed
is
not
important
a
new
attempt
at
cmos
fast
compared
to
old
cmos
power
consumption
often
lower
than
ttl
possibly
a
good
choice
for
generalpurpose
logic
assuming
availability
and
affordability
cmos
logic
levels
not
ttl
ones
beware
very
limited
range
of
supply
voltages
compared
to
older
cmos
also
major
rise
of
power
consumption
at
faster
speeds
with
ttl
logic
levels
much
the
same
comments
as
read
the
fine
print
on
things
like
power
consumption
ttl
compatibility
in
cmos
involves
some
compromises
thrown
in
for
speed
freaks
the
low
end
of
ecl
various
sources
claim
that
it
is
easier
to
work
with
than
superfast
ttl
for
serious
highspeed
work
less
forgiving
though
read
and
follow
the
rules
or
it
wont
work
availability
to
hobbyists
limited
can
be
expensive
for
real
speed
freaks
hot
ecl
harder
to
handle
than
and
inconvenient
packages
much
more
useful
datasheets
however
as
for
compatibility
between
families
the
families
except
and
are
all
more
or
less
logiclevel
compatible
but
how
many
devices
you
can
drive
from
one
output
varies
enormously
with
x
and
y
you
just
have
to
read
the
specs
and
do
the
arithmetic
and
are
compatible
with
the
others
with
a
bit
of
hassle
compatibility
can
be
a
bit
of
hassle
or
a
lot
of
hassle
depending
on
what
supply
voltage
is
using
or
to
anything
else
is
considerable
hassle
me
i
use
and
with
a
sprinkling
of
and
are
interesting
but
i
havent
used
either
significantly
yet
all
work
is
one
