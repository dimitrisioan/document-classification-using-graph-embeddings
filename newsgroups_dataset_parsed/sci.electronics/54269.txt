WRITES
I
RECENTLY
TOOK
APART
MY
COLOR
SONY
TV
TO
CLEAN
THE
VOLUME
PUSHBUTTONS
AND
WHEN
I
PUT
THE
BEAST
BACK
TOGETHER
THE
FLYBACK
WHINE
GOT
MUCH
LOUDER
IS
THIS
EASY
TO
FIX
WHICH
PART
IS
RESONATING
I
HAVE
HEARD
RUMORS
OF
A
SPRAY
THAT
WILL
FIX
THE
NOISE
IS
THIS
A
SIMPLE
THING
FOR
A
TV
REPAIRMAN
TO
FIX
THANKS
SCOTT
AHHA
IM
NOT
ALONE
AT
LAST
WHICH
SONY
DO
YOU
HAVE
I
HAVE
A
PREXBR
SERIES
CIRCA
THAT
DAMN
THING
USED
TO
MAKE
NOISE
LIKE
A
MADMAN
I
HADHAVE
SEPARATE
PROBLEMSONE
BEING
THE
FLYBACK
THE
OTHER
WAS
THE
ASSEMBLY
WHERE
THE
WINDINGS
OF
THE
YOKE
CAME
TOGETHER
FIRST
I
FOUND
BY
POKING
AROUND
THE
WINDINGS
ON
THAT
ASSEMBLY
THE
THING
WOULD
MAKE
NOISE
I
GUESS
THAT
THERE
WAS
ENOUGH
OF
A
POTENTIAL
IN
THAT
ASSEMBLY
TO
LEAK
SO
I
SPRAYED
IT
WITH
A
DIELECTRIC
INSULATION
SPRAYI
THINK
IT
WAS
URETHANE
OR
ACYRILIC
THAT
FIXED
IT
SECOND
FLYBACKFOR
THE
LIFE
OF
ME
I
CANT
ISOLATE
THIS
ONE
IF
I
LEAVE
THE
COVER
OFF
THE
TV
WILL
BE
QUIET
IF
I
PUT
THE
COVER
BACK
ON
AND
LET
IT
HEAT
UP
ITLL
START
TO
WHINEKINDA
HARD
TO
SOLVE
WITH
THE
COVER
ON
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
WHO
USED
TO
FIX
TVS
SAYS
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
PINHOLE
LEAK
SOMEWHERE
ON
THE
FLYBACK
USUALLY
ITS
SURROUNDED
BY
A
BUNCH
OF
BLACK
DUSTDIRT
I
HOPE
THIS
IS
A
STARTIF
YOU
FIND
SOMETHING
OUT
LET
ME
KNOW
