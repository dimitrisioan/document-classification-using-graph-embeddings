i
recently
took
apart
my
color
sony
tv
to
clean
the
volume
pushbuttons
and
when
i
put
the
beast
back
together
the
flyback
whine
got
much
louder
is
this
easy
to
fix
which
part
is
resonating
i
have
heard
rumors
of
a
spray
that
will
fix
the
noise
is
this
a
simple
thing
for
a
tv
repairman
to
fix
thanks

ahha
im
not
alone
at
last
which
sony
do
you
have
i
have
a
prexbr
series
circa
that
damn
thing
used
to
make
noise
like
a
madman
i
hadhave
separate
problemsone
being
the
flyback
the
other
was
the
assembly
where
the
windings
of
the
yoke
came
together
first
i
found
by
poking
around
the
windings
on
that
assembly
the
thing
would
make
noise
i
guess
that
there
was
enough
of
a
potential
in
that
assembly
to
leak
so
i
sprayed
it
with
a
dielectric
insulation
sprayi
think
it
was
urethane
or
acyrilic
that
fixed
it
second
flybackfor
the
life
of
me
i
cant
isolate
this
one
if
i
leave
the
cover
off
the
tv
will
be
quiet
if
i
put
the
cover
back
on
and
let
it
heat
up
itll
start
to
whinekinda
hard
to
solve
with
the
cover
on
a
friend
of
mine
who
used
to
fix
tvs
says
there
might
be
a
pinhole
leak
somewhere
on
the
flyback
usually
its
surrounded
by
a
bunch
of
black
dustdirt
i
hope
this
is
a
startif
you
find
something
out
let
me
know
