ULTRALONG

WRITES
I
HAVE
A
PROJECT
THAT
WAS
DROOPED
IN
MY
LAP
THAT
IS
SOMEWHAT
A
PAIN
TO
DESIGN
WHAT
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
IS
A
STABLE
ULTRALONG
SOLID
STATE
TIMER
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
DO
IS
TO
PLACE
THIS
THING
ON
THE
ANTARTIC
ICE
SHELF
AND
MEASURE
THE
AMOUNT
OF
SNOW
FALL
OVER
A
PERIOD
OF
SIX
WEEKS
EVERY
TWO
WEEKS
THEY
WANT
TO
TRIP
A
SELONOID
TO
DISCHARGE
DIFFERENT
COLORED
PELLETS
BY
GAS
PRESSURE
OUT
ACROSS
THE
SNOW
THEN
BY
DIGGING
DOWN
INTO
THE
SNOW
THE
SNOW
FALL
AMOUNT
CAN
BE
MEASURED
AS
THEY
COME
TO
THE
DIFFERENT
COLOR
PELLETS
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TRYING
TO
BUILD
A
TIMER
THAT
WOULD
STAND
THE
COLD
DEGREES
AND
A
POWER
SOURCE
THAT
WOULDNT
DRAIN
I
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
THE
TIMERS
AND
THE
STANDARD
DUAL
TIMERS
BUT
THIER
TEMP
SPECS
WONT
GO
THAT
LOW
ALSO
TWO
WEEKS
EQUATES
TO
SECONDS
PER
FIRING
WHICH
MEANS
ONE
BIG
TIMING
CAP
I
HAVE
FOUND
FARAD
YES
FARAD
CAPS
THAT
HAVE
A
WORKING
VOLTAGE
OF
VOLTS
AND
ARE
SMALL
IN
SIZE
BUT
AGAIN
THE
TIME
OF
DISCHARGE
AT
OR
LOWER
DEGREES
ISNT
LINEAR
I
WAS
THINKING
OF
USING
SEVERAL
TIMERS
CHAINED
TOGETHER
TO
FIRE
THE
SELONID
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TIMING
PERIOD
BUT
THAT
BLASTED
COLD
AND
THE
DRAIN
ON
A
BATTERY
OVER
SIX
WEEKS
IS
THE
PAIN
ONE
POSSIBILITY
WOULD
BE
TO
USE
SOLAR
PANELS
BUT
THIS
IS
DURING
THE
SIX
MONTH
TWILIGHT
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
GOOD
IDEAS
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
WES
FIRSTLY
I
WOULD
NEVER
CONSIDER
TRYING
TO
MAKE
A
ONESHOT
TIMER
YOUR
CAP
WILL
HAVE
BEEN
DESIGNED
AS
A
RAM
BATTERY
SUBSTITUTE
RATHER
THAN
FOR
USE
IN
APPLICATIONS
WHERE
YOU
WISH
TO
DRAIN
THE
CAP
WITH
A
CONSTANT
CURRENT
THEIR
PERFORMANCE
IN
SOME
RESPECTS
IS
MORE
AKIN
TO
BATTERIES
THAN
TO
A
NORMAL
CAP
THE
OTHER
POINT
IS
THAT
BIG
ELECTROS
ARE
USUALLY
RATED
WITH
TOLERANCES
SO
CALCULATING
EXACTLY
WHAT
CAPACITANCE
YOU
HAVE
PARTICULARLY
WHEN
CONSIDERING
THE
COLD
YOU
SHOULD
BE
LOOKING
AT
DESIGNING
A
MICROPOWER
OSCILLATOR
AND
DIVIDER
CHAIN
THAT
ROLLS
OVER
FROM
ZERO
TO
MAXIMUM
COUNT
OR
VICEVERSA
ONCE
EVERY
SECONDS
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
USE
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
CLOCK
YOU
WOULD
NEED
A
DIVIDER
CHAIN
OF
TO
GIVE
AN
ERROR
OF
LESS
THAN
ONE
PERCENT
IN
THE
FIRING
TIMES
OVER
THE
SIX
WEEK
PERIOD
OF
COURSE
YOU
COULD
TRIM
THE
OSCILLATOR
TO
GIVE
YOU
EXACT
TIME
BUT
THE
LIKELYHOOD
OF
THE
OSCILLATOR
REMAINING
EXACTLY
CONSTANT
AT
IS
LOW
ANYWAY
I
WOULD
SUSPECT
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
FAR
MORE
BATTREY
DRAIN
IN
FIRING
THE
SOLENOID
THAN
THERE
WOULD
BE
IN
THE
TIMER
CIRCUIT
CAVEAT
IM
NOT
EXPERIENCED
IN
LOW
TEMPERATURE
ELECTRONICS
SO
I
CANT
GUARANTEE
THAT
THIS
OR
ANY
OTHER
APPROACH
IS
THE
BEST

INHOSPITABLE
CONDITIONS
