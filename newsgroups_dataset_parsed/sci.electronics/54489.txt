WRITES
IM
TRYING
TO
BUILD
A
MIXER
FOR
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
TO
RUN
SEVERAL
THINGS
INTO
A
SINGLE
BOOM
BOX
I
HAVE
A
CIRCUIT
THAT
USES
AN
OPAMP
POWERED
BY
EITHER
A
COUPLE
OF
BATTERIES
OR
USING
SOME
KIND
OF
POWER
SUPPLY
BUT
IN
A
CATALOG
I
WAS
LOOKING
AT
RECENTLY
A
PASSIVE
MIXER
FOR
GUITAR
WAS
ADVERTISED
TAHT
DOESNT
APPEAR
TO
USE
ANY
POWER
AT
ALL
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
THE
CIRCUIT
FOR
THIS
WOULD
BE
BECAUSE
THEN
I
COULD
JUST
ADAPT
IT
FOR
RCA
JACKS
AND
SAVE
MY
FRIEND
AND
I
ALOT
OF
MESSING
WITH
BATTERIES
AND
PLUGS
THANKS
WELL
THE
FASTEST
CRUDEST
MIXER
ASIDE
FROM
JUST
PHYSICALLY
CONNECTING
ALL
YOUR
INPUTS
TOGETHER
DIRECTLY
IS
TO
RUN
EACH
SIGNAL
THROUGH
A
RESISTOR
TO
A
COMMON
OUTPUT
THE
RESISTORS
GIVE
SOME
ISOLATION
SO
THE
SIGNAL
SOURCES
ARENT
DRIVING
DIRECTLY
INTO
EACH
OTHER
