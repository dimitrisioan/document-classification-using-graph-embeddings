a
list
i
get
when
i
was
combing
through
some
microfilm
one
day
here
at
drexel
while
completely
board
most
of
these
circuits
are
pretty
easy
to
constuct
and
can
be
done
by
a
novice
this
is
basically
some
stuff
that
could
prove
useful
to
you
without
having
to
sit
down
and
either
design
or
buy
the
stuff
not
a
good
word
but
im
tired
right
now
hope
you
enjoy
if
you
have
any
additions
send
them
to
me
and
ill
add
them
to
the
list
they
dont
have
to
be
from
this
particular
magazine

just
have
to
be
interesting
