MULTIPLIER
PROBLEM
HI
IVE
JUST
BUILT
A
VALVE
PREAMP
AND
USE
A
DIODECAPACITOR
VOLTAGE
MULTIPLIER
TO
STEP
THE
SUPPLY
VOLTAGE
UP
TO
APPROX
AS
THE
LOAD
RESISTANCE
INCREASES
THE
RC
CONSTANT
DECREASES
AND
HENCE
THE
OUTPUT
VOLTAGE
DROPS
I
NEED
AS
HIGH
AN
OUTPUT
VOLTAGE
AS
POSSIBLE
ABOUT
THE
CIRCUIT
CONSISTS
OF
SEVEN
VOLTAGE
MULTIPLIER
STAGES
IE
DIODES
AND
CAPACITORS
EACH
CAPACITOR
DEVELOPS
ABOUT
ACROSS
THEM
AND
I
TAKE
THE
OUTPUT
FROM
ACROSS
SEVEN
EACH
CAPACITOR
IS
AT
IF
I
INCREASE
EACH
OF
THE
CAPACITORS
RATING
THAT
WILL
INCREASE
THE
RC
CONSTANT
AND
HENCE
ALLEVIATE
SOME
OF
THE
PROBLEM
THESE
CAPACITORS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
A
LITTLE
EXPENSIVE
AS
I
NEED
OF
THEM
SO
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
I
CONNECTED
A
AT
CAPACITOR
IN
PARALLEL
WITH
THE
OUTPUT
AND
HENCE
IN
PARALLEL
WITH
THE
SEVEN
CAPACITORS
WILL
IT
AS
I
ASSUME
INCREASE
THE
C
IN
CIRCUIT
AND
HENCE
INCREASE
THE
RC
TIME
CONSTANT
IF
IT
DOES
AND
MY
OUTPUT
VOLTAGE
BECOMES
MORE
STABLE
BY
DOING
THIS
THEN
I
WILL
HAVE
KILLED
TWO
BIRDS
WITH
ONE
STONE
AS
I
AM
EXPERIENCING
SOME
RIPPLE
AND
HENCE
AMP
HUM
AND
THIS
NEW
CAPACITOR
WILL
SMOOTH
THIS
OUT
AND
CAN
ANYONE
RECOMEND
A
SUITABLE
VALUE
FOR
AN
INDUCTOR
CHOKE
TO
BE
PLACED
IN
THE
OUTPUT
LINE
OF
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
TO
FILTER
OUT
THE
MAINS
HUM
LOWEST
RESISTANCE
POSSIBLE
IVE
NOT
GOT
MY
PREAMP
WITH
ME
AT
THE
MOMENT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
DISTRACTION
IM
AT
UNIVERSITY
AND
IVE
GOT
TO
GET
MY
DISSERTATION
FINISHED
IN
TWO
WEEKS
HENCE
IM
MAILING
NOT
PLAYING
WITH
MY
SOLDEROING
IRON
ITLL
BE
CHEAPER
TOO
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
ESPECIALLY
IF
NEW
LARGE
CAPACITORS
DONT
WORK
AS
PLANNED
EMAIL
PLEASE
CANT
ALWAYS
