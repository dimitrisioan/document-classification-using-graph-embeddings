i
have
a
question
about
accessing
certain
addresses
on
a
chip
particulary
a
eprom
although
i
dont
know
that
much
about
it
as
i
understand
it
theres
a
pin
on
the
chip
that
when
voltage
is
applied
kicks
up
the
address
the
question
is
how
do
you
determine
how
many
bytes
the
address
is
incremented
by
for
example
if
i
have
code
i
want
to
be
accessed
at
and
also
at
say
how
do
i
move
the
address
pointer
to
those
positions
thanks
for
any
info

always
looking
for
classic
video
games
for
the
following
systems
atari
judging
by
your
sig
you
are
trying
to
make
some
kind
of
game
cartridge
information
of
how
to
build
an
eeprom
cartidge
for
the
vectrex
is
available
via
anonymous
ftp
at
csusedu
since
youve
chosen
the
you
are
probably
trying
to
make
a
multicart
to
do
this
simply
load
the
game
images
into
the
eeprom
at
etc
your
eeprom
burner
software
may
allow
this
or
you
will
have
to
assemble
the
images
into
one
file
yourself
with
suitable
gaps
wire
up
the
cartridge
with
the
lower
address
bits
going
to
the
game
console
and
the
high
bits
going
to
switches
to
choose
between
games
to
directly
answer
your
question
above
the
pin
that
kicks
up
the
address
is
simply
another
address
line
for
a
concrete
example
with
the
and
games
images
you
would
wire
to
the
cartridge
and
to
switches
the
switches
would
allow
you
to
pick
from
the
games
on
the
eeprom
