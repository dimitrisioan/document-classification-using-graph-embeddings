re
what
do
nuclear
sites
cooling
towers
do
others
said
actually
fossil
fuel
plants
run
hotter
than
the
usual
boilingwater
reactor
nuclear
plants
theres
a
gripe
in
the
industry
that
nuclear
power
uses
vintage
steam
technology
so
its
more
important
in
nuclear
plants
to
get
the
cold
end
of
the
system
as
cold
as
possible
hence
big
cooling
towers
when
the
utility
gave
up
on
that
cinnci
oh
plant
zimmer
and
announced
they
were
going
to
convert
it
to
a
coalfired
scheme
the
turbines
were
already
in
place
and
they
were
the
lowtemp
type
so
the
plan
was
install
a
second
set
of
high
temp
turbines
and
feed
the
lowtemp
ones
with
the
output
of
the
new
ones
never
saw
anything
more
on
this
did
they
ever
really
build
it
a
host
is
a
host
from
coast
to
no
one
will
talk
to
a
host
thats
unless
the
host
that
isnt
closepob
is
busy
hung
or
