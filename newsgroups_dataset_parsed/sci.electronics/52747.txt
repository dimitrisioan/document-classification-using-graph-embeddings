WRITES
DONT
USE
BIG
CAPACITORS
THEY
ARE
UNRELIABLE
FOR
TIMING
DUE
TO
LEAKAGE
INSTEAD
USE
A
QUARTZ
CRYSTAL
AND
DIVIDE
ITS
FREQUENCY
BY
TIMES
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
MHZ
DIVIDED
BY
CYCLE
PER
WEEKS
APPROXIMATELY
I
WOULDNT
EXPECT
ANY
COMPONENTS
OTHER
THAN
BATTERIES
OR
ELECTROLYTIC
CAPACITORS
TO
FAIL
AT
C
OR
F
FOR
THAT
MATTER
EITHER
THE
BATTERY
IS
GOING
TO
BE
YOUR
BIG
PROBLEM
ALSO
OF
COURSE
YOUR
CIRCUIT
SHOULDNT
DEPEND
ON
EXACT
VALUES
OF
RESISTORS
WHICH
A
CRYSTAL
CONTROLLED
TIMER
WONT
WOULDNT
A
CRYSTAL
BE
AFFECTED
BY
COLD
MY
GUT
FEELING
IS
THAT
AS
A
MECHANICALLY
RESONATING
DEVICE
EXTREME
COLD
IS
LIKELY
TO
AFFECT
THE
COMPLIANCE
TERMINOLOGY
OF
THE
QUARTZ
AND
HENCE
ITS
RESONANT
FREQUENCY
