OK
HERES
MY
PROBLEM
I
KEEP
HEARING
ABOUT
THESE
LITTLE
CREDIT
CARD
TYPE
OF
THINGS
WHICH
DETECT
IR
LIGHT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
CHARGE
THEM
UP
UNDER
NORMAL
VISIBLE
LIGHT
AND
THEN
IF
THEY
ARE
EXPOSED
TO
IR
LIGHT
THEY
GLOW
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
ARE
AVALIABLE
IN
THE
STATES
AND
EVEN
IN
ENGLAND
BUT
ALAS
I
LIVE
IN
AUSTRALIA
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
INFORM
ME
IF
I
CAN
GET
THESE
THINGS
OVER
HERE
AND
IF
SO
WHERE
AND
HOW
MUCH
ALSO
ARE
THEY
REALLY
COMMONLY
AVALIABLE
IN
THE
STATES
AND
IF
SO
THEN
HOW
MUCH
ARE
THEY
AND
WHO
SELLS
THEM
MAYBE
IF
I
CANT
GET
ONE
HERE
ILL
WRITE
