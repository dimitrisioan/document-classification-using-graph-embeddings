i
need
to
make
a
power
supply
that
can
take
input
from
a
cigarette
lighter
in
a
car
dc
and
drive
volts
at
up
to
amps
i
know
enough
to
know
that
a
simple
voltage
divider
with
two
resistors
wont
do
it
right
can
such
a
thing
be
made
from
radioshackable
parts
without
too
much
difficulty
jps
bf
ps
ive
looked
for
premade
things
like
this
at
radio
shack
but
none
of
it
seems
to
go
any
higher
than
about
joel
skelton
north
avenue
trade
school
dept
of
round
things
ask
for
scooter
technologies
and
receive
see
if
radio
shack
has
a
national
semiconductor
adjustable
voltage
regulator
national
part
number
or
these
devices
are
rated
for
an
input
to
output
differential
of
up
to
volts
amps
digikey
corp
has
these
parts
as
well
as
several
other
useful
regulators
if
you
dont
have
their
catalog
their
phone
number
is
i
can
only
guess
that
you
may
intend
to
recharge
a
vdc
nicad
battery
with
this
device
and
if
im
right
you
may
want
to
look
through
some
of
the
hobbiest
books
to
get
various
ideas
for
battery
charging
circuits
first
if
you
get
stuck
email
me
your
fax
number
if
you
have
one
and
ill
send
you
some
suggestions
or
schematics
