RE
ILLUSION
I
MISSED
THE
FIRST
ARTICLES
ON
THIS
LINE
DUE
TO
NOT
HAVING
A
CHANCE
TO
READ
THE
NEWS
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
DAYS
THE
IDEA
IS
COMMERCIALIZED
IN
AT
LEAST
ONE
PRODUCT
THE
PRIVATE
EYE
THATS
A
SMALL
CUBESHAPED
DEVICE
THAT
THE
USER
STRAPS
AROUND
THE
HEAD
SIMILAR
TO
A
SWEAT
BAND
THERE
IS
A
BOOM
THAT
COMES
FROM
THE
SIDE
ON
WHICH
THE
DEVICE
IS
MOUNTED
SO
THAT
IT
IS
POSITIONED
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
USERS
EYE
THE
PRIVATE
EYE
WE
HAD
HERE
FOR
EVALUATION
WAS
HERCULESMDA
COMPATIBLE
THE
INNARDS
ARE
A
ROW
LEDS
THAT
ARE
SWEPT
UP
AND
DOWN
BY
A
GALVONOMETERLIKE
MOVEMENT
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
THE
SWEEPING
LED
BAR
FORMS
A
FUSED
RASTER
THERE
IS
A
VIRTUAL
IMAGE
PROJECTED
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
USER
THAT
THE
VISUAL
SYSTEM
TENDS
TO
FUSE
WITH
THE
BACKGROUND
I
DIDNT
LIKE
THE
DEVICE
VERY
MUCH
I
FOUND
IT
EASIEST
TO
USE
IF
I
LOOKED
AT
A
BLANK
WHITE
WALL
I
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
FOCUS
TRACKING
IF
I
GLANCED
DOWN
TO
LOOK
AT
MY
KEYBOARD
FOR
AN
OUTOFTHEWAY
KEY
THE
UNIT
ALSO
EMITTED
A
SOFT
BUZZ
AND
VIBRATION
WHICH
I
FOUND
ANNOYING
SOME
PEOPLE
DIDNT
SEEM
TO
MIND
THE
BUZZ
PROPERLY
USED
HOWEVER
THE
IMAGE
CLARITY
WAS
QUITE
CRISP
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THE
COMPANY
HAS
TAKEN
THE
TECHNOLOGY
ANY
FURTHER
IN
THE
LAST
YEAR
OR
TWO
BUT
IT
DID
SEEM
TO
HAVE
PROMISE
