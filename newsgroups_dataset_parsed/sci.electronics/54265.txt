nothing
but
if
you
read
my
whole
suggestion
im
saying
that
you
register
via
mail
by
mailing
in
your
registration
card
then
the
company
send
you
the
patch
which
includes
the
info
you
put
on
the
registration
card
the
problem
with
this
scheme
is
that
when
i
buy
a
game
i
want
to
play
it
that
daymailing
a
card
to
and
from
california
would
probably
take
a
week
or
more
i
didnt
say
the
program
is
disabled
did
i
i
hate
it
when
people
take
my
words
out
of
context
i
mean
that
once
you
have
installed
it
you
cannot
deinstall
it
without
registering
it
or
transfer
it
to
another
machine
or
some
sort
of
limitation
the
author
will
decide
which
will
be
removed
when
the
program
is
registered
what
you
cant
remove
it
unless
you
register
you
gotta
be
joking
right
what
happens
if
i
get
a
demoversion
of
that
program
install
it
and
then
decide
that
i
dont
like
it
do
i
have
to
register
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
it
hell
no
that
is
the
last
thing
i
would
think
of
if
that
is
what
you
mean
then
you
would
better
make
pretty
sure
that
a
statement
to
that
effect
is
printed
loud
and
clear
on
the
package
a
better
way
to
implement
the
above
mentioned
scheme
is
imho
to
allow
anyone
to
install
the
program
but
if
they
register
they
get
some
additional
features
enabled
it
could
mean
only
one
new
exe
file
needed
to
be
copied
to
have
got
the
fullversion
of
the
program
of
course
anyone
is
free
to
delete
or
remove
that
program
at
whatever
time
they
like
still
we
face
the
trouble
of
moving
the
new
exe
file
around
that
could
be
solved
by
having
the
user
registering
him
self
and
get
back
a
specially
marked
for
him
or
her
a
new
exe
file
as
for
some
sort
of
limitations
here
are
some
suggestions
limit
the
size
of
data
that
the
program
can
work
with
disable
saving
the
data
print
it
out
with
some
defects
in
the
output
but
be
sure
to
mark
them
as
such
let
some
popup
screen
appear
for
ca
secs
when
the
program
is
started
andor
exited
etc
but
dont
have
it
that
you
must
register
to
be
able
to
remove
it
