RE
LEAD
ACID
BATTERIES
CONCRETE
IN
ARTICLE
CARTER
AMES
WRITES
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
ONE
THING
ACTUALLY
TWO
I
HOPE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
PROPER
PLACE
TO
POST
THIS
SUBJECT
WHY
DOES
A
LEAD
ACID
BATTERY
DISCHARGE
AND
BECOME
DEAD
TOTALLY
UNUSEABLE
WHEN
STORED
ON
A
CONCRETE
FLOOR
I
DECIDED
TO
BRING
THE
BATTERY
IN
FROM
THE
LAWN
MOWER
AND
THE
MOTORCYCLE
FROM
THE
UNHEATED
GARAGE
THIS
YEAR
TO
PRESERVE
THEM
AND
I
JUST
WENT
TO
USE
THEM
AND
NOTICED
THAT
NOT
ONLY
DO
THEY
NOT
WORK
BUT
THEY
ACT
LIKE
THE
TWO
TERMINALS
ARE
SHORTED
I
ASKED
A
FRIEND
AND
HE
SAID
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
NEVER
DO
THAT
CAUSE
IT
RUINS
THEM
BUT
HE
COULDNT
TELL
ME
WHY
THANKS
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
I
HEARD
THIS
DISCUSSED
ON
NORTHERN
EXPOSURE
THERE
IS
A
MOLECULAR
JUXTAPOSITION
OF
THE
MOLECULES
IN
THE
BATTERY
AND
THE
MOLECULES
IN
THE
CONCRETE
THIS
ACTS
AS
AN
ATTRACTANT
TO
UFOS
ACTUALLY
THEIR
CREW
MEMBERS
AND
THEY
ARRIVE
AT
THE
SCENE
OF
THE
BATTERYCONCRETE
COMBINATION
THEN
THEY
PROCEED
TO
SUCK
ALL
THE
ENERGY
OUT
OF
THE
BATTERIES
REMEDY
SET
THE
BATTERY
ON
A
NONCONCRETE
FLOOR
