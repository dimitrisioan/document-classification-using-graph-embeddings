NOT
THAT
THE
QUESTION
IS
ANYTHING
IMPORTANT
BUT
I
AM
STILL
CURIOUS
WHY
IS
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
PRINTED
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
ARE
GREEN
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
FEW
BLUE
ONES
BUT
NO
RED
YELLOW
COMPANY
LOGO
ETC
IS
THERE
A
TECHNICAL
REASON
OR
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
THE
MARKETING
GENIUSES
HAVE
NOT
TOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
YET
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
MAKE
BOARDS
IN
OTHER
COLORS
AND
I
HAVE
AN
AD
FOR
LASER
LIGHTSHOW
EQUIPMENT
WHICH
OFFERS
THE
CIRCUIT

THE

GREEN

IS
JUST
THE

OF

THE

IS
THE

AND
I
SUSPECT
THAT
COLOR
IS
A
