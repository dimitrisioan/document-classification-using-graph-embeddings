IM
CONSIDERING
MODERNIZING
SOME
OLD
WIRING
IN
MY
HOME
AND
I
NEED
A
LITTLE
ADVICE
ON
OUTLET
WIRING
SEVERAL
OUTLETS
ARE
THE
OLD
TWO
PRONG
TYPE
WITHOUT
THE
GROUND
NATURALLY
THE
WIRE
FEEDING
THESE
OUTLETS
IS
WITHOUT
THE
GROUND
WIRE
I
NOTICED
AT
THE
FUSEBOX
THAT
SOME
CIRCUITS
HAVE
THE
WITH
GROUND
AND
THAT
ON
THESE
CIRCUITS
THE
GROUND
WIRE
WAS
TIED
TO
THE
SAME
BUS
AS
THE
NEUTRAL
WHITE
WIRE
THIS
IS
CONTRARY
TO
THE
ELECTRICAL
CODE
AND
SHOULD
BE
FIXED
WELL
MY
HOUSE
WAS
BUILT
JUST
LAST
YEAR
AND
THE
BREAKER
BOX
IS
WIRED
THE
SAME
WAY
THERE
SHOULD
BE
A
CONNECTION
OF
THE
GROUND
WIRE
TO
A
GROUND
IN
THE
BREAKER
BOX
THERE
ALSO
SHOULD
BE
A
CONNECTION
OF
THE
NEUTRAL
WIRE
TO
A
GROUND
IN
THE
BREAKER
BOX
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NO
OTHER
PLACE
IN
THE
BUILDING
WHERE
SUCH
A
CONNECTION
OCCURS
IE
NOT
IN
ANY
OF
THE
OUTLET
BOXES
THE
NEUTRAL
WHITE
WIRE
IS
A
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
FOR
THE
PLUG
AND
IS
NOT
SAFE
TO
TOUCH
WHILE
THE
GROUND
GREEN
WIRE
IS
A
PROTECTIVE
GROUND
AND
CARRIES
NO
CURRENT
UNLESS
SOME
KIND
OF
ELECTRICAL
FAULT
HAS
OCCURRED
ITS
SAFE
TO
TOUCH
THE
PROTECTIVE
GROUND
BUT
NOT
TO
TOUCH
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
CURRENT
IN
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
ITS
OUTLETBOX
END
WILL
NOT
BE
AT
THE
SAME
GROUND
POTENTIAL
AS
ITS
BREAKERBOX
END
