HAVE
SEEN
BOTH

OWN
A
BUBBLEJET
A
APPLE
STYLEWRITER
WHICH
HAS
A
CANNON
ENGINE
WITH
A
DPI
RATED
OUTPUT

OUTPUT
IS
VERY
GOOD
WITH
QUALITY
PAPER
WHICH
IS
VERY
IMPORTAINT
CHEAP
PAPER
GIVES
BAD
RESULTS

USE
SEALED
PAPER
AND
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENC
IS
THAT
THE
INK
IS
LESS
DARK
THAN
TONER
I
COMPAIRE
TO
THE

THEN
AGAIN
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
TO
