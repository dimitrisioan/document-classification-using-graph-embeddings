i
was
wondering
if
anyone
would
be
able
to
help
me
on
twwo
related
mjmsubjects
i
am
currently
learning
about
amfm
receivers
and
recieving
mjmcircuits
i
understand
a
lot
of
things
but
a
few
things
i
am
confused
mjmabuot
the
first
is
the
mixer
to
mix
the
rf
and
local
oscillator
mjmfrequencies
to
make
the
if
does
anyone
have
any
cicruit
diagrams
as
mjmsimple
as
possible
for
this
kind
of
mixer
i
have
come
across
a
mjmmcsbl
mixer
chip
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
it
in
any
catalogs
mjmactiveetc
mjmalong
the
same
note
are
there
any
simple
fm
receiver
circuits
anyone
mjmmay
have
stashed
away
somewhere
and
they
couold
let
me
see
mjmps
any
really
good
books
on
amfm
theory
along
with
detailed
mjmelectrical
diagrams
would
help
a
lot
mjmi
have
seen
a
lot
of
theory
books
with
no
circuits
and
a
lot
of
mjmcircuit
books
with
no
theory
but
one
without
the
other
does
not
help
digikey
has
the
chip
which
has
a
local
oscillator
and
mixer
on
one
chip
for
a
great
combination
of
theory
with
actual
circuits
the
best
reference
for
nonengineers
is
probably
the
radio
amateurs
handbook
from
the
arrl
most
librarys
have
it
in
the
reference
section
slmr
if
ignorance
is
bliss
why
arent
there
