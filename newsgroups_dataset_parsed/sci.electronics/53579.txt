I
DO
NOT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
ADCOM
MOBIL
AUDIO
PRODUCTS
BUT
I
DO
KNOW
FOR
A
FACT
THAT
ADCOM
DOES
NOT
MAKE
ITS
OWN
HIGH
END
HOME
AUDIO
EQUPTMENT
AND
THAT
OF
IT
COMES
DIRECTLY
OUT
OF
TIAWAN
LIKE
MOST
HIGHVOLUME
MANUFACTURERS
ADCOM
HAS
MOST
OF
ITS
PC
BOARDS
ASSEMBLED
OFFSHORE
IN
THEIR
CASE
MOSTLY
IN
THE
FAR
EAST
FINAL
ASSEMBLY
AND
TESTING
ARE
DONE
IN
EAST
BRUNSWICK
AND
OF
COURSE
YOU
OLDER
FOLKS
ON
THE
NET
WILL
REMEMBER

AND
KUDOS

SO
THEIR

WERE
NOT
ONLY
DESIGNED
HERE
BUT
BUILT
HERE
IN
THE
USA
THEN
THEY
WENT
TO
MEXICO
AND
THEN
TO
TAIWAN
RIGHT
AFTER
THEIR
SALES
SKYROCKETED
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
STEREOPILE
REVIEW
IF
YOU
HAVE
UNITS
THAT
OLD
LOOK
FOR
MADE
IN
STICKERS
ON
YOUR
UNIT
