i
guess
what
i
am
saying
is
that
your
question
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
answer
what
exactly
do
you
want
to
know
do
you
need
a
good
one
for
a
project
you
are
working
on
how
secure
must
it
be
are
you
trying
to
crack
one
that
someone
else
has
used
i
can
probably
make
suggestions
assuming
the
activity
is
strictly
legal
in
general
it
is
a
bad
idea
legally
to
tamper
with
copy
protection
it
can
also
lead
to
corruption
of
files
which
you
necessarily
do
not
have
back
ups
of
being
as
they
are
copy
protected
which
can
be
devestating
do
you
have
absolutely
no
ideas
for
practical
applications
and
are
merely
curious
please
clear
up
those
questions
and
ill
try
to
help
as
much
as
i
can
may
we
interpret
this
as
an
offer
to
volunteer
as
editor
for
a
copy
protection
faq
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
am
not
alone
welcoming
such
an
initiative
i
will
volunteer
to
ask
some
of
the
questions
if
you
will
provide
the
answers
