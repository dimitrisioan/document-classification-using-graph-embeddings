i
am
looking
for
any
info
i
can
get
on
the
nec
monitor
i
know
that
it
is
a
multisync
but
that
is
about
all
i
plan
on
buying
one
secondhand
in
a
while
depending
on
its
specs
does
anyone
know
the
minmax
frequencies
whether
it
is
interlaced
noninterlaced
or
both
video
compatability
etc
i
have
seen
a
reference
to
it
being
pitch
with
x
resolution
and
that
it
supports
svga
from
one
source
and
that
it
doesnt
support
svga
from
another
source
neither
source
seemed
to
have
much
reliable
info
so
i
dont
want
to
take
a
guess
im
at
home
right
now
and
so
am
away
from
my
monitor
files
the
following
is
off
the
top
of
my
head
subject
to
revision
worthwhatyapayforit
sort
of
info
if
you
dont
hear
from
anyone
who
has
spec
sheet
in
hand
email
me
and
ill
look
it
up
if
im
remembering
correctly
the
is
a
mm
pitch
multisync
that
covers
at
least
vga
khz
horizontal
hz
vertical
to
x
hz
which
is
going
to
be
about
khz
horizontal
it
may
go
somewhat
higher
than
that
on
the
horizontal
but
you
wont
be
happy
with
anything
beyond
x
on
a
tube
you
probably
wont
be
too
thrilled
with
the
x
on
this
tube
but
it
will
sync
up
and
display
it
i
prefer
at
least
a
for
this
resolution
since
svga
is
itll
do
that
too
the
horizontal
range
probably
goes
lower
than
but
i
dont
know
if
it
goes
all
the
way
down
to
straight
ntscrate
tv
which
need
about
khz
sweep
as
far
as
video
compatibility
if
im
reading
the
question
right
it
wont
take
anything
but
analog
rgb
inputs
in
other
words
it
has
no
way
to
decode
ntsc
or
yc
video
inputs
you
would
need
some
sort
of
board
to
to
this
conversion
like
the
sorts
of
things
that
let
you
display
ntsc
on
a
vga
display
hopefully
now
ill
see
this
response
of
mine
and
itll
remind
me
to
look
this
stuff
up
and
confirm
it
or
force
me
to
post
a
hasty
retraction
ok
i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
accepted
digital
input
i
still
dont
know
for
sure
if
it
accepts
both
interlaced
and
noninterlaced
as
i
have
gotten
conflicting
