WRITES
I
HATE
HARD
COPY
MANUALS
AND
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
ALL
DOCS
ONLINE
NOT
BECAUSE
I
WANT
TO
COPY
THE
PROGRAM
BUT
BECAUSE
ITS
USUALLY
FASTER
AND
AND
CONVENIENT
THAN
SIFTING
THROUGH
AN
OLD
BOOK
I
CANT
FIND
JUST
MHO
BUT
I
PREFER
HARDCOPY
BOOKS
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
HAVE
THREE
OR
FOUR
OF
THEM
OPEN
SPREAD
ACROSS
THE
BED
NEXT
TO
THE
DESK
IN
MY
DORM
AND
REFERENCE
THEM
WHILE
USING
THE
PROGRAM
FULLSCREEN
THE
WINDOWS
HELP
THINGS
COME
CLOSEST
TO
GOOD
ONLINE
DOCUMENTATION
IVE
SEEN
BUT
THEY
GENERALLY
ARENT
DETAILED
ENOUGH
AND
WOULD
PROBABLY
TAKE
A
LARGE
AMOUNT
OF
SPACE
EVEN
COMPRESSED
WHICH
IS
AT
A
PREMIUM
ON
MY
SYSTEM
IN
FACT
THE
MANUALS
ARE
THE
PRIMARY
REASON
I
BOUGHT
BORLANDS
C
COMPILER
INSTEAD
OF
USING
THE
ONE
THE
LAB
LICENSED
IN
THE
LAB
OF
COURSE
IVE
GOT
A
SHELF
FULL
OF
BOOKS
TO
HELP
ME
OUT
WHEN
IM
STUCK
TO
EACH
HIS
OWN
OFF
DEEPER
END
WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
THINK
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
A
BACKUP
COPY
ALMOST
ALL
NEW
SOFTWARE
MUST
BE
INSTALLED
TO
THE
HARD
DISK
SO
YOU
ARE
LEFT
WITH
THE
ORIGINALS
AS
YOUR
BACKUPS
I
THINK
ITS
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
SPACE
AND
MONEY
AS
WELL
AS
IT
MAKES
IT
TO
TEMPTING
TO
LEND
OUT
THE
BACKUPS
WEVE
DESTROYED
ABOUT
SIX
SETS
OF
ORIGINAL
MICROSOFT
WORD
FOR
MAC
AND
WORD
FOR
WINDOWS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
A
BAD
BATCH
OF
DISKS
DONT
HAVE
THE
FAINTEST
IDEA
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
THEM
THEY
JUST
WENT
BAD
WERENT
STORED
NEAR
ANY
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
OR
OTHERWISE
MISTREATED
INDEED
THEY
WERE
ONLY
USED
ONCE
GIVEN
THIS
AND
THE
MASSIVE
HEADACHES
FINDING
A
WORKING
SET
OF
DISKS
TO
FIX
SOME
OF
THE
MACHINES
THAT
PERIODICALLY
GO
DOWN
ID
SAY
HAVING
WORKING
BACKUPS
IS
A
GODSEND
I
SURE
WISH
WED
HAD
THEM
SOMETIMES
I
THINK
MURPHYS
LAW
HOLDS
TRUE
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
NEWTONS
WHEN
WE
NEEDED
THEM
I
THINK
ITS
SORTOF
LIKE
SNAKE
ANTIVENIN
OF
THE
TIME
YOU
HAVE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
USE
FOR
IT
BUT
WHEN
YOU
NEED
IT
BOY
DO
YOU
EVER
NEED
IT
I
DONT
HAVE
BACKUPS
OF
MY
ORIGINALS
AT
HOME
BUT
THEN
MY
MACHINE
DOESNT
SEE
ANYWHERE
NEAR
THE
USEABUSE
OF
THESE
HERE
AT
THE
LAB
AND
SO
I
CONSIDER
IT
LESS
OF
A
RISK
STILL
I
USUALLY
MAKE
WORKING
COPIES
OF
THEM
WHEN
I
INSTALL
THEM
AND
THEN
EVENTUALLY
REUSE
THESE
WORKING
COPIES
FOR
SOMETHING
ELSE
NO
FLAMES
INTENDED
JUST
MY
THOUGHTS
JUST
MINE
TOO
BTW
BEFORE
ANYONE
NOTICES
MY
MENTIONING
COPYING
PROGRAMS
FROM
MACHINE
TO
MACHINE
WHEN
WE
DO
INSTALLS
HERE
AND
WONDERS
ABOUT
THE
LICENSING
THE
UPPERMANAGEMENT
NONSTUDENT
STAFF
OF
COURSE
ARE
METICULOUS
IN
CHECKING
WITH
PROVIDERS
OF
THE
SOFTWARE
AND
MAKING
SURE
WE
ARE
STICKING
