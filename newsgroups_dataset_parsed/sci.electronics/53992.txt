I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
NEW
PORTABLE
CD
PLAYER
FOR
THE
OFFICE
AND
I
NOTICE
THAT
IT
PROUDLY
PROCLAIMS
TIMES
OVERSAMPLING
ON
THE
BOX
NOW
WHILE
I
THINK
I
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
OVERSAMPLING
IS
THE
RATE
OF
DISCRETE
SAMPLES
EXCEEDS
THE
HIGHEST
FREQUENCY
COMPONENT
OF
INTEREST
BY
SOME
FACTOR
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THIS
TIMES
BUSINESS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
MY
FIRST
CD
PLAYER
WAS
IT
REALLY
YEARS
AGO
THE
SPECS
SAID
TIMES
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHETHER
IM
GETTING
SENILE
IF
IM
NOT
THEN
WHAT
GOOD
DOES
IT
DO
FOR
THE
PLAYER
TO
TAKE
SAMPLES
AT
A
HIGHER
RATE
THE
DATA
IS
ONLY
EVER
READ
ONCE
BARRING
MISTRACKS
AND
SUCH
OF
COURSE
AND
EVENTUALLY
GETS
TURNED
INTO
KHZ
BIT
TWO
CHANNEL
DATA
OVERSAMPLING
TAKES
TWO
DISCRETE
DATA
POINTS
AND
INTERPOLATES
POINTS
BETWEEN
THEM
FOR
N
TIMES
OVERSAMPLING
WHEN
I
ASKED
PEOPLE
SAID
THAT
THE
INTERPOLATION
WAS
NOT
SIMPLY
LINEAR
INTERPOLATION
BUT
SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE
COMPLICATED
YOU
ARE
QUITE
CORRECT
IN
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
THE
FILTERING
IS
NOT
INTERPOLATION
AS
THAT
WOULD
DISTORT
THE
FREQUENCY
CONTENT
OF
THE
SIGNAL
THEY
DO
INTERPOLATE
ITS
NOT
LINEAR
INTERPOLATION
THOUGH
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
THAT
THE
FREQUENCY
CONTENT
IS
NOT
ALTERED
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
THE
BASEBAND
SPECTRUM
IS
PRESERVED
AND
SO
IS
EVERY
NTH
IMAGE
SPECTRUM
THE
OTHER
IN
N
IMAGE
SPECTRA
ARE
REMOVED
WHERE
N
IS
THE
OVERSAMPLING
RATE
YOU
ARE
LISTENING
TO
GENERALLY
THESE
PLAYERS
RUN
THE
SAMPLES
THRU
AN
ALLPASS
FILTER
NETWORK
I
HAVE
DONE
THIS
FOR
ECG
WAVEFORMS
FROM
A
PERSONS
IDEALLY
THE
FILTER
HAS
A
GAIN
OF
FROM
TO
AND
A
GAIN
OF
FROM
TO
THE
NEW
NYQUIST
FREQUENCY
IN
PRACTICE
A
FINITE
TRANSITION
BAND
IS
REQUIRED
AND
THERE
IS
ALSO
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
PASSBAND
RIPPLE
AND
STOPBAND
LEAKAGE
WITH
A
HIGH
ORDER
EG
TAPS
DIGITAL
FILTER
A
VERY
GOOD
APPROXIMATION
CAN
BE
EASILY
ACHIEVED
BIT
DELETED
ABOUT
OBSERVATIONS
OF
INTERPOLATION
FILTER
AT
WORK
IN
CASE
YOU
CARE
THE
FILTERING
METHOD
USES
AN
FIR
FINITE
IMPULSE
RESPONSE
FILTER
ID
GUESS
THAT
CD
MAKERS
USE
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
METHOD
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
KNOW
THE
REAL
ANSWER
ID
SAY
THAT
THEY
USE
A
TAPPED
DELAY
LINE
WITH
RESISTOROPAMP
WEIGHTING
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THE
FILTERING
THIS
STRIKES
ME
AS
THE
MOST
COST
EFFECTIVE
METHOD
FOR
VOLUME
PRODUCTION
RUNS
NO
THEY
ACTUALLY
USE
A
DIGITAL
FIR
JUST
LIKE
YOURS
BUT
BUILT
IN
HARDWARE
ON
CUSTOM
VLSI
CHIPS
FOR
MAINLY
ECONOMIC
REASONS
ANYWAY
THEN
THE
PURPOSE
OF
OVERSAMPLING
IS
TO
MOVE
THE
EFFECTIVE
SAMPLING
RATE
UP
TO
N
TIMES
KHZ
IN
ORDER
TO
USE
HIGHER
FREQUENCY
ANTIALIASING
FILTERS
FOR
THE
SAME
QUALITY
FILTER
HIGHER
OVERSAMPLING
LETS
YOU
BUILD
CHEAPER
FILTERS
WHEREAS
FOR
THE
SAME
PRICE
FILTER
HIGHER
OVERSAMPLINGS
LETS
YOU
BUILD
BETTER
FILTERS
SO
ASSUMING
THE
QUALITY
OF
ALL
OTHER
COMPONENTS
IN
A
CD
PLAYER
REMAINED
THE
SAME
OVERSAMPLING
SHOULD
ALLOW
A
MANUFACTURER
TO
PRODUCE
SLIGHTLY
BETTER
SOUND
DUE
TO
ANTIALIAS
FILTERING
ACTUALLY
I
THINK
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEY
DO
THIS
IS
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
SAY
THAT
THEY
HAVE
A
MARKETTING
GIMIC
I
WOULD
GUESS
THAT
IT
IS
ACUTALLY
CHEAPER
TO
FILTER
AN
OVERSAMPLED
SIGNAL
THAN
NOT
YOU
CAN
USE
SLOPPIER
COMPONENTS
AND
GIVE
THE
FILTER
A
ROLLOFF
THAT
ISNT
SO
SHARP
ITS
TOO
BAD
THAT
THEY
CHARGE
MORE
FOR
SOMETHING
THAT
I
THINK
IS
ACTUALLY
LESS
COSTLY
TO
BUILD
I
GUESS
THAT
THE
ANSWER
IS
SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
AS
AN
INTERESTING
ASIDE
SOME
OF
YOU
OUT
THERE
MAY
BE
AWARE
OF
A
SCHEME
USED
BY
PIONEER
AND
WADIA
WHICH
IS
CALLED
BY
PIONEER
AT
LEAST
LEGATO
LINK
I
HAVENT
HEARD
ONE
OF
THESE
PLAYERS
BUT
BY
READING
ADVERTISING
BLURB
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
PSEUDOTECHNICAL
ARTICLES
I
DEDUCED
THAT
ALL
THEY
DO
IS
BUILD
A
LOUSY
DIGITAL
OVERSAMPLING
FILTER
AND
LET
A
LOAD
OF
THE
FIRST

TALKING
