BOB

HI
I
WAS
DOING
RESEARCH
ON
SUBLIMINAL
SUGGESTION
FOR
A
PSYCHOLOGY
PAPER
AND
I
READ
THAT
ONE
RESEARCHER
FLASHED
HIDDEN
MESSAGES
ON
THE
TV
SCREEN
AT
OF
A
SECOND
IS
THAT
POSSIBLE
I
THOUGHT
THE
MAXIMUM
RATE
THE
TV
WAS
EVEN
CAPABLE
OF
DISPLAYING
IMAGES
WAS
OF
A
SECOND
OR
OF
A
SECOND
FOR
AN
IMAGE
COMPOSED
OF
ONLY
ODD
OR
EVEN
SCAN
LINES
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
THE
FASTEST
COMPLETE
IMAGE
THAT
COULD
BE
PRESENTED
ON
TV
WOULD
BE
ONE
FIELD
WHICH
IS
OF
A
SECOND
APPROXIMATELY
OF
COURSE
THE
PHRASE
TV
SCREEN
IS
OFTEN
THROWN
AROUND
IN
REFERENCE
TO
ANY
CRT
DISPLAY
SO
PERHAPS
THIS
RESEARCHER
WASNT
USING
NORMAL
TV
RATES
MIGHT
EVEN
BE
A
VECTOR
STROKEWRITER
DISPLAY
IN
WHICH
CASE
THE
LOWER
LIMIT
ON
IMAGE
TIME
IS
ANYONES
GUESS
AND
IS
PROBABLY
PHOSPHORPERSISTENCE
LIMITED
ACTUALLY
A
LOT
OF
THIS
WORK
USED
TO
BE
DONE
WITH
A
CRT
THAT
HAD
A
BEAMSPLITTER
MOUNTED
IN
FRONT
AND
A
TACHISTOSCOPE
DRIVING
IT
THE
TACHISTOSCOPE
IS
REALLY
JUST
A
SLIDE
PROJECTOR
WITH
A
VERY
FAST
SHUTTER
LOW
TECH
BUT
IT
DOES
THE
JOB
