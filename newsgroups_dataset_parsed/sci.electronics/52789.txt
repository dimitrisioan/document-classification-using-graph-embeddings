MY
DAD

REALLY
CANT
ANSWER
AND
ID
APPRECIATE
SOME
NETWISDOM
HIS
QUESTION
IS
ABOUT
SOME
DIAMETER
BALLS
WHICH
ARE
ATTACHED
TO
ELECTRIC
POWER
LINES
IN
HIS
AREA
HES
SEEN
UP
TO
A
HALF
DOZEN
BETWEEN
TWO
POLES
NEITHER
OF
US
HAVE
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
ELECTRIC
POWER
DISTRIBUTION
MY
ONLY
GUESS
WAS
THAT
THEY
MAY
BE
A
CAPACITIVE
DEVICE
TO
EQUALIZE
THE
INDUCTANCE
OF
THE
GRID
BUT
WHY
SO
MANY
BETWEEN
TWO
POLES
ANYONE

WHAT
THEY
REALLY
ARE

A
RELATED
FAQ
FOR
THIS
IS

BETTER
GROUP

ENLIGHTENMENT
THE

THE
AMPLITUDE
OF
OSCILLATIONS
OF
THE
WIRE
DURING
PERIODS
OF
HIGH
WINDS
IVE
SEEN
