WRITES
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
NEED
FOR
A
GROUND
PLANE
IN
A
DIGITAL
SYSTEM
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
SUCH
A
GROUND
PLANE
IS
ALSO
NECESSARY
IN
AN
ANALOG
SYSTEM
NOTE
THIS
GROUND
PLANE
WILL
NOT
BE
CONNECTED
EXCEPT
AT
ONE
POINT
TO
THE
SIGNAL
GROUND
I
KEEP
GETTING
CONFLICTING
ANSWERS
OVER
THIS
DOES
HAVING
A
GROUND
PLANE
IN
AN
ANALOG
SYSTEM
HELP
REDUCE
NOISE
ALSO
MY
SYSTEM
ONLY
DEALS
WITH
LOW
FREQUENCY
SIGNALS
UP
TO
ONLY
WELL
ONE
REASON
FOR
GETTING
CONFLICTING
ANSWERS
IS
THAT
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
YOU
WANT
THE
GROUND
PLANE
TO
DO
A
CONTINUOUS
CONDUCTOR
IS
A
GOOD
ELECTROSTATIC
SHIELD
DO
YOU
HAVE
SIGNALS
ON
YOUR
BOARD
THAT
NEED
SHIELDING
ROM
OTHER
THINGS
THIS
SHIELDING
WONT
DO
MUCH
GOOD
FOR
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
UNLESS
YOU
MAKE
IT
CONTINUOUS
AROUND
THE
CIRCUIT
TO
BE
SHIELDED
LIKE
A
FARADAY
CAGE
THE
FLIP
SIDE
OF
THE
COIN
IF
YOU
ARE
WORKING
WITH
VERY
HIGH
IMPEDANCES
YOU
COULD
END
UP
WITH
CAPACITANCES
TO
THE
GOUND
PLANE
THAT
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
YOU
ARENT
LIKELY
TO
ENCOUNTER
THIS
AT
BUT
AT
IT
CAN
BE
A
REAL
PROBLEM
ONE
THAT
BIT
ME
ONCE
