thats
why
you
dont
find
blue
leds
or
for
that
matter
some
other
colour
of
leds
that
is
not
to
say
that
blue
leds
cant
be
found
ive
seen
blue
leds
sold
but
they
were
just
your
typical
visible
light
led
in
a
blue
plastic
covering
they
didnt
emit
very
much
light
sorry
charlie
i
have
a
dozen
very
blue
leds
on
my
bench
right
now
they
have
a
clear
plastic
case
and
when
lit
are
absolutely
blue
the
hue
is
sort
of
a
summer
day
cloudless
sky
blue
but
make
no
mistake
they
are
blue
you
can
buy
them
from
digikey
circuit
specialist
jameco
i
think
ledtronics
stanley
optoelectronics
and
others
the
current
price
is
around
each
for
small
quantities
i
will
also
be
selling
them
through
my
mailorder
company
in
the
near
future
weeks
write
for
details
if
interested
