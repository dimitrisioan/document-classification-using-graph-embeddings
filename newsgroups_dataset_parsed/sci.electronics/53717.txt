indicating
a
exception
when
it
check
for
the
presencetype
of
fpu
when
i
reinstall
an
the
system
works
fine
but
with
the
even
at
mhz
it
does
not
work
the
designer
of
the
board
mentioned
that
putting
a
pullup
resistor
on
datastrobe
ohm
might
help
but
that
didnt
change
anything
does
anybody
have
some
suggestions
what
i
could
do
does
this
look
like
a
cpufpu
communications
problem
or
is
the
particular
chip
dead
it
is
a
pull
not
new
moreover
the
place
i
bought
it
from
is
sending
me
an
i
thought
that
the

labeled
mc
not
xc
for
not
finalized
mask
design

too
have
a
math
coprocessor
which
i
installed
succesfully
in
my
mega
midget
racer
clocked
at
mhz
i
have
tried
clocking
my
fpu
at
to
mhz
and
it
all
worked
just
fine
i
have
a
cpu
i
dont
know
why
my
fpu
has
an
xc
my
original
fpu
was
label
but
it
seems
to
work
fine
on
my
system
maybe
you
just
have
a
bad
chip

mean
experimental
chip

of
motorola
chip
