I
BUILT
A
LITTLE
PROJECT
USING
THE
RADIO
SHACK
RELAYS
TO
SWITCH
AUDIO
I
GOT
PRETTY
BAD
CLICKS
WHEN
THE
THING
SWITCHED
I
WAS
DOING
MY
QUESTION
IS
IS
THERE
A
GOOD
RELAYRELAY
CIRCUIT
THAT
I
CAN
USE
FOR
SWITCHING
AUDIO
SO
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
NOISE
OF
ANY
KIND
ON
THE
AUDIO
LINES
ARE
YOU
SWITCHING
HIGH
LEVEL
SIGNALS
OR
LOW
LEVEL
SIGNALS
LIKE
PREAMP
A
NOVEL
CIRCUIT
I
USED
TO
BUILD
WAS
A
PRIMITIVE
OPTICAL
ISOLATOR
IT
CONSISTS
OF
A
RESISTIVE
PHOTOCELL
AND
A
LAMP
ALL
PACKAGED
IN
A
TUBE
WHEN
THE
LAMP
IS
OFF
THE
CELL
IS
HIGH
RESISTANCE
TURN
THE
LAMP
ON
AND
THE
RESISTANCE
LOWERS
I
USE
AN
FET
OPTOISOLATER
TO
SWITCH
MICROPHONE
LEVEL
SIGNALS
THERE
IS
NO
CLICK
SINCE
I
PUT
A
CAP
ACROSS
THE
LED
DISTORTION
MEASUREMENT
ARE
VERY
LOW
WITH
MIC
LEVEL
AND
THEY
WENT
UP
TO
AT
A
DB
LINE
LEVEL
ALL
I
DID
WAS
PUT
THE
FET
IN
SERIES
WITH
ONE
LEG
OF
THE
BALANCED
LINE
NO
HUMS
POPS
JUST
AUDIO
JUMPING
OUT
OF
SILENCE
THE
FET
RUNS
ABOUT
MILLION
OHMS
WITH
THE
LED
DARK
AND
DROPS
TO
OHMS
WITH
IT
ON
HEY
IT
WORKS
AND
WORKS
WELL
GALEN
WATTS
