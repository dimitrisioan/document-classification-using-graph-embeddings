QU
JUST
A
FEW
COMMENTS
ABOUT
THE
FEASABILITY
OF
ZIPPING
UP
A
BUNCH
OF
MILES
ON
YOUR
ELECTRONIC
ODOMETER
WITH
AN
OSCILLATOR
I
WOULDNT
EXPECT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
THIS
NOT
BECAUSE
THE
ENGINEERS
AT
BMW
ARE
PUTTING
IN
ANTIFRAUD
LOGIC
BUT
JUST
BECAUSE
AN
AUTOMOBILE
IS
A
NOISY
HOSTILE
ENVIRONMENT
FOR
ELECTRONICS
AND
I
WOULD
EXPECT
THE
SOFTWARE
TO
BE
CONSERVATIVE
IF
I
WERE
TO
DESIGN
A
MICROPROCESSORBASED
ODOMETERSPEEDOMETER
PROGRAM
IT
WOULD
HAVE
THE
FOLLOWING
FEATURES

PRESETTING
THE

IF
THIS
IS
THE

BOARD
OUT
OF
A

DASHBOARD
I
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
A
SINGLE
BIG
CHIP
WITH
LOTSA
PINS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE

GOOD
LUCK
GETTING
AT
THE
COUNTER
I
WOULDNT
EXPECT
A
HIGH

FREQUENCY
TO
DAMAGE
THE
METER
REMEMBER
ITS
PROBABLY
DAMPED
SO
IT
CANT
MOVE
TOO
FAST
AND
IS
PROBABLY
PROTECTED
AFTER
ALL
A

AN
EXTREMELY
