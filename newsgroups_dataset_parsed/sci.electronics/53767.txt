re
electronic
odometers
was
used
bmw
qu
just
a
few
comments
about
the
feasability
of
zipping
up
a
bunch
of
miles
on
your
electronic
odometer
with
an
oscillator
i
wouldnt
expect
to
be
able
to
do
this
not
because
the
engineers
at
bmw
are
putting
in
antifraud
logic
but
just
because
an
automobile
is
a
noisy
hostile
environment
for
electronics
and
i
would
expect
the
software
to
be
conservative
if
i
were
to
design
a
microprocessorbased
odometerspeedometer
program
it
would
have
the
following
features
just
off
the
top
of
my
head
debouncingdeglitching
is
this
a
real
pulse
or
just
a
glitch
smoothing
the
rateofchange
of
speed
cannot
be
too
high
this
is
a
car
not
an
electron
top
speed
limit
anything
above
is
ridiculous
must
be
electrical
noise
or
contact
bounce
as
for
getting
in
and
presetting
the
pins
if
this
is
the
circuit
board
out
of
a
bmw
dashboard
i
seem
to
remember
a
single
big
chip
with
lotsa
pins
in
the
middle
of
the
card
good
luck
getting
at
the
counter
i
wouldnt
expect
a
high
input
frequency
to
damage
the
meter
remember
its
probably
damped
so
it
cant
move
too
fast
and
is
probably
protected
after
all
a
car
is
an
extremely
hostile
place
for
delicate
electronics
there
used
to
be
an
app
note
in
the
national
semiconductor
linear
databook
that
went
into
this
in
good
detail
