GREG
STOVALL
WRITES
ANYWAY
OVER
THE
WEEKEND
I
WAS
RESTING
ON
THE
SOFA
IN
BETWEEN
CHORES
AND
NOTICED
THAT
I
BRIEFLY
PICKED
UP
WHAT
SOUNDED
LIKE
HAM
RADIO
TRAFFIC
OVER
MY
STEREO
AND
TELEVISION
EVEN
THOUGH
BOTH
WERE
OFF
ALSO
ALL
THE
TOUCH
SENSITIVE
LIGHTS
IN
MY
HOUSE
START
GOING
WACKO
CYCLING
THROUGH
THEIR
FOUR
BRIGHTNESS
STATES
I
PRESUME
THAT
SOME
HAM
OPERATOR
WITH
AN
ILLEGAL
AMPLIFIER
DROVE
PAST
MY
HOUSE
I
LIVE
ON
A
BUSY
THOROUGHFARE
WOULD
THIS
BE
A
CORRECT
PRESUMPTION
WHAT
KIND
OF
POWER
MUST
HE
BE
PUTTING
OUT
TO
CAUSE
THE
EFFECTS
THE
AFFECTED
EQUIPMENT
IS
ABOUT
FEET
FROM
THE
ROAD
HAMS
CAN
LEGALLY
RUN
UP
TO
WATTS
IT
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
HOWEVER
THAT
A
HAM
WOULD
BE
RUNNING
THAT
KIND
OF
POWER
FROM
A
CAR
HAM
RIGS
FOR
CARS
PUT
OUT
AROUND
WATTS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
A
WATT
RADIO
WOULD
CAUSE
INTERFERENCE
TO
CONSUMER
ELECTRONIC
FEET
AWAY
MOST
TVS
STEREOS
AND
VCRS
HAVE
VERY
POOR
RF
SHIELDING
IF
YOU
EXPERIENCE
THE
PROBLEM
FREQUENTLY
IT
MAY
BE
CAUSED
BY
A
HAM
CBER
OR
OTHER
RADIO
OPERATOR
IN
A
BASE
STATION
NEARBY
THE
INTERFERENCE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
CAUSED
BY
A
RADIO
TRANSMITTER
USED
FOR
OTHER
PURPOSES
SUCH
AS
POLICE
FIRE
ETC
IF
YOU
HEARD
VOICES
OVER
YOUR
STEREO
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
IN
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
SOURCE
IS
AN
RF
TRANSMITTER
IF
YOU
HAVE
FREQUENT
TROUBLE
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
TRY
THE
RF
FERRITE
CHOKES
AVAILABLE
AT
RADIO
SHACK
THE
INTERFERENCE
IS
PROBABLY
BEING
PICKED
UP
BY
YOUR
SPEAKER
WIRES
AND
THOSE
CHOKES
CAN
BE
INSTALLED
ON
THE
WIRES
VERY
EASILY
WITHOUT
CUTTING
THEM
GOOD
INSTRUCTIONS
ARE
INCLUDED
WITH
THE
CHOKES
IF
THAT
DOES
NOT
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
SEARCH
YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR
A
RADIO
OPERATOR
LOOK
FOR
ANTENNAS
ON
THE
ROOF
OR
CAR
TALK
TO
HIMHER
ABOUT
YOUR
PROBLEM
THERE
ARE
THINGS
A
RADIO
OPERATOR
CAN
DO
TO
REDUCE
INTERFERENCE
