situation
sometimes
called
block
sync
you
can
generate
such
a
combined
or
composite
sync
in
two
simple
ways
or
the
h
and
v
syncs
together
which
gives
you
the
nonserrated
block
sync
or
exor
them
which
makes
serrations
try
it
actually
the
exor
doesnt
really
do
kosher
serrated
sync
since
it
puts
the
rising
and
falling
for
that
matter
edge
of
the
h
sync
pulse
off
by
a
pulse
width
but
that
usually
makes
no
difference
sometimes
it
depends
on
your
monitor
and
your
timing
if
you
dont
have
enough
vertical
front
porch
and
you
use
xor
composite
sync
you
can
get
evenodd
tearing
at
the
top
of
the
screen
which
is
very
sensitive
to
the
hhold
control
it
looks
like
what
you
would
expect
if
you
scanned
the
even
fields
say
onto
a
sheet
of
mylar
and
had
pinched
the
upper
left
corner
with
your
fingers
and
started
to
tear
it
off
the
tube
with
proper
composite
sync
equalizing
pulses
the
interlace
is
rock
solid
