homemade
projector
automation
hi
all
im
an
assistant
manager
at
a
local
art
theater
here
in
columbus
id
like
to
expand
our
show
automation
a
bit
namely
add
the
capability
to
use
cue
tapes
to
bring
the
houselights
up
our
current
automation
consoles
date
from
the
early
and
dont
provide
this
function
we
already
have
the
combo
failsafecontact
rollers
to
read
the
cuetapes
and
our
dimmer
system
will
raise
the
houselights
when
its
fadeup
control
circuit
vac
is
momentarily
closed
for
at
least
second
ive
tried
wiring
the
dimmer
control
to
a
relay
activated
when
the
cue
tape
completes
the
circuit
low
tech
and
simple
but
theres
one
problem
in
order
to
get
the
second
pulse
there
needs
to
be
a
shload
of
cuetape
on
the
film
runs
at
feet
per
minute
so
to
get
a
second
pulse
there
needs
to
be
at
least
inches
of
solid
cuetape
ideally
i
would
like
to
use
a
single
crosscue
to
accomplish
this
function
a
single
strip
of
cuetape
perpendicular
to
the
length
of
the
film
this
would
give
a
pulse
of
approximately
of
a
second
what
i
need
is
a
circuit
to
detect
the
short
cue
and
activate
the
relay
for
around
second
the
ability
to
adjust
how
long
the
relay
is
activated
would
be
nice
i
figure
this
would
require
an
rc
circuit
of
some
sort
im
sure
some
of
you
already
have
the
solution
figured
out
in
your
heads
any
suggestions
and
schematics
would
be
appreciated
thanks
