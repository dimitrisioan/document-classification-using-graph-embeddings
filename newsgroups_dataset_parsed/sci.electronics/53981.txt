one
notsoquick
question
to
throw
out
there
for
you
guys
for
our
class
project
we
need
to
design
and
build
a
power
supply
to
the
following
specs
voltatge
adjustable
from
current
limited
at
voltage
must
stay
within
of
designated
value
for
i
from
ac
ripple
less
than
mv
rms
to
decide
which
kind
of
circuit
you
must
know
the
initialprecission
of
the
limitercurrent
and
the
allowed
tempdrift
in
the
first
case
you
can
use
a
ube
of
a
transistor
as
a
voltagereference
of
about
vdc
with
a
tempdrift
of
in
the
second
case
its
better
you
use
a
bandgapref
and
a
opampcircuit
to
detect
the
maximumcurrent
the
output
of
this
opamp
controlls
the
outputstage
to
limit
the
current
