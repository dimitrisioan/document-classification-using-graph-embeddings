RE
WHY
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
ARE
GREEN
KUUSAMAKAARNECSTUTFI
KUUSAMA
JUHAVTT
WRITES
NOT
THAT
THE
QUESTION
IS
ANYTHING
IMPORTANT
BUT
I
AM
STILL
CURIOUS
WHY
IS
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
PRINTED
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
ARE
GREEN
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
FEW
BLUE
ONES
BUT
NO
RED
YELLOW
COMPANY
LOGO
ETC
IS
THERE
A
TECHNICAL
REASON
OR
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
THE
MARKETING
GENIUSES
HAVE
NOT
TOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
YET
THE
GREEN
LAYER
IS
A
SOLDERMASK
AND
IS
USED
TO
MAKE
A
FINISHED
BOARD
LOOK
NEAT
AND
TO
AVOID
SOLDER
BRIDGES
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
USING
WAVE
SOLDERING
OR
ANY
OTHER
MECHANIZED
APPROACH
IVE
SEEN
RED
MASK
BUT
MOST
THAT
IVE
SEEN
ARE
GREEN
A
BAKELITE
BOARD
WILL
LOOK
BROWN
IN
COLOUR
AND
IF
THE
SOLDER
MASK
IS
PUT
ON
LOOKS
LIKE
A
BROWN
BOARD
WITH
GREEN
PAINT
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OR
JUST
ONE
SIDE
OF
THE
BOARD
A
FIBREGLASS
BOARD
WILL
LOOK
GREEN
FROM
THE
SIDE
BECAUSE
THE
GREEN
SOLDERMASK
MAKES
THE
BOARD
APPEAR
THAT
COLOUR
IF
YOU
GOT
A
FIBREGLASS
BOARD
WITH
NO
MASK
IT
WOULD
BE
A
WHITISHGREY
COLOUR
TEFLON
BOARDS
DO
EXIST
AS
WELL
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THAT
ONE
ID
GUESS
THE
STUFF
THEY
INVENTED
FOR
SOLDER
MASK
WAS
GREEN
SO
THEYRE
NOT
ABOUT
TO
CHANGE
ALSO
ANY
CHANGE
IN
ANY
CHEMICAL
PROBABLY
REQUIRES
A
BETTER
THAN
NORMAL
CLEANING
OF
THE
MACHINES
THAT
MAKE
BOARDS
A
LOT
OF
COMPANIES
DO
NOT
MAKE
THEIR
OWN
BOARDS
THEY
SHIP
THEM
TO
A
REAL
BOARDHOUSE
