RECEIVER
SYSTEM
DEAR
NETTERS
I
WANT
TO
SEND
EMGSIGNALS
FROM
A
RUNNING
PERSON
TO
A
COMPUTER
EACH
SIGNAL
IS
WIDE
AND
THERE
IS
UP
TO
OF
THEM
ON
EACH
RUNNING
PERSON
THE
SIGNAL
IS
ONLY
TO
BE
SENT
OVER
A
FEW
HUNDRED
METERS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
FREQUENCY
INTENDED
FOR
THIS
USE
IS
ABOUT
AND
ABOUT
TO
MAKE
THE
TRANSMITTERS
AS
LIGHT
AS
POSSIBLE
I
SUPPOSE
IT
WILL
BE
BEST
THE
TO
SEND
THE
SIGNALS
IN
AN
ANALOG
FORM
AS
THIS
APPLICATION
IS
RATHER
SPECIALIZED
I
DO
NOT
EXPECT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BUY
THE
EXACT
TRANSMITTER
UNITS
I
NEED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
IMAGINE
THAT
I
CAN
BUY
THE
RECEIVER
SOMEWHERE
I
NEED
A
MULTICHANNEL
UP
TO
CHANNELS
RECEIVER
OR
COMPLETE
RECEIVERS
IN
SOME
RACK
SYSTEM
WHERE
ONE
CAN
ADD
AS
MANY
RECEIVERS
AS
NEEDED
IN
THE
PARTICULAR
CASE
DO
ANYBODY
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
EXISTING
SUCH
RECEIVER
SYSTEM
ON
THE
MARKET
BALDURRSPIS
PLEASE
RESPOND
BY
EMAIL
RATHER
THAN
