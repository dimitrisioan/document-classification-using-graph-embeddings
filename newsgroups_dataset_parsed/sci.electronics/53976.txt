WRITES
IM
WONDERING
IF
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
USE
RADIO
WAVES
TO
MEASURE
THE
DISTANCE
BETWEEN
A
TRANSMITTERS
AND
RECEIVER
YES
YOU
COULD
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
MEASURE
THE
SIGNAL
STRENGTH
AND
DETERMINE
DISTANCE
THIS
WOULD
BE
FOR
SHORT
DISTANCES
FT
AND
I
WOULD
NEED
TO
HAVE
ACCURACY
OF
INCHES
OR
SO
WELL
LETSEE
WHIPPING
OUT
SOON
TO
BE
GX
NANOSECONDS
RESOLUTION
HMM
THATLL
BE
RATHER
DIFFICULT
THE
MORE
STANDARD
READ
BETTER
METHOD
IS
TO
USE
ULTRASOUND
GENERALLY
SOMEWHERE
AROUND
SOUND
TRAVELS
A
HECK
OF
A
LOT
SLOWER
THAN
LIGHT
RADIO
WAVES
AND
IS
THEREFORE
MUCH
EASIER
TO
DEAL
WITH
WHAT
FREQUENCIES
WOULD
BE
BEST
FOR
THIS
OR
DOES
MATTER
IT
MIGHT
BE
EASIEST
TO
VISIT
A
HARDWARE
STORE
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
NUMEROUS
SONIC
ESTIMATOR
TYPE
DEVICES
THAT
DO
WHAT
YOU
WANT
HERE
MANY
ARE
PRETTY
CHEAP
TOO
IN
FACT
FOR
AWHILE
THE
STANLEY
ESTIMATOR
WAS
SELLING
FOR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THATS
THE
ONE
I
BOUGHT
