WRITES
STUFF
ABOUT
HARDWARE
KEYS
IF
YOU
PUT
ANOTHER
COMPUTER
ON
THE
PORT
INSTEAD
OF
THE
KEY
YOU
CAN
HACK
THEM
BY
READING
WHAT
HAPPENS
SO
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
THIS
DONE
BUT
I
THINK
ITS
POSSIBLE
YOUD
NEED
SOME
HARDWARE
KNOWLEDGE
AND
SOME
SOFTWARE
TO
READ
THE
PORT
TRUE
WHICH
IS
WHY
MANY
OF
THE
NEWER
KEYS
SHIP
OUT
OH
MAYBE
BITS
OR
SO
HAVE
THE
KEY
ENCRYPT
THEM
AND
RETURN
THEM
TO
THE
PC
MAKING
A
BUNCH
OF
THESE
BITS
PART
OF
YOUR

IS
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
MAKE
SURE
THINGS
WONT
RUN
WITHOUT
THE

ANYWAY
THEN
THIS
SCHEME
AT
LEAST
DEFEATS
YOUR
APPROACH
ITS
A
LITTLE
COSTLY
THOUGH
PERSONALLY
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
COPY
PROTECTION
AND
AGREE
WITH
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
THE

INCONVENIENCE
THAT
IT
CAUSES

OUTWEIGHS
