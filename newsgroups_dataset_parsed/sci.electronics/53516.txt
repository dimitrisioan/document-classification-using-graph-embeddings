can
microwaves

it
seems
reasonable
to
me
that
a
microwave
transmitterreceiver
setup
could
do
the
job
for
example
say
you
want
to
map
an
acre
lot
itd
be
convenient
to
place
mw
transmitters
around
the
lots
periphery
either
or
and
then
carry
a
handheld
recorder
and
walk
to
a
point
on
the
lot
press
a
button
and
the
coords
of
the
recorders
location
is
stored
as
digital
data
whats
the
chance
of
this
working
any
systems
like
this
already
exist
what
kind
of
accuracy
could
you
expect
what
would
something
like
this
cost
to
prototype
is
there
a
better
alternative
than
microwaves
of
course
you
could
develope
this
system
but
there
is
already
a
system
called
global
positioning
satellites
it
gives
three
dimensional
coordinates
anywhere
on
earth
many
surveyors
use
this
system
with
a
differential
receivertransmitter
to
get
coordinates
within
centimeters
basic
receivers
with
resolution
of
a
few
meters
on
a
good
day
are
available
from
many
sources
