EQUALIZER
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
IN
NETLAND
KNEW
OF
A
SIMPLE
WAY
TO
MAKE
A
EQUALIZER
SINGLE
CHANNEL
I
NEED
IT
TO
ACCEPT
LINE
INPUTS
TAPE
DECK
CD
PLAYER
ETC
AND
OUTPUT
TO
THE
SAME
SO
INPUT
IMPEDANCE
SHOULD
EQUAL
OUTPUT
IMPEDANCE
ALSO
SINCE
I
AM
DRIVING
A
LINE
I
WOULD
NEED
VOLT
PP
OUTPUT
FINAL
REQUIREMENT
IS
THAT
I
CAN
EITHER
CONTROL
IT
DIGITALLY
OR
CONTROL
IT
EASILY
OR
WITH
FEW
RESISTORS
FINALLY
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
OF
ANY
FILTER
OR
EQUALIZER
CHIPS
THAT
MIGHT
BE
USEFUL
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
COUPLE
OF
THEM
FROM
NATIONAL
AND
MAXIM
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
