a
while
ago
i
saw
some
translucent
pads
about
or
so
that
could
be
plugged
into
something
and
they
would
glow
one
was
red
another
green
another
blue
interresting
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
would
have
a
feed
on
anything
of
this
nature
and
of
the
price
oh
the
pads
were
rubberlike
and
were
floppy
like
about
thick
or
so
the
curiosities
that
you
speak
of
are
el
electroluminescent
pads
they
are
mostly
used
as
backlights
for
lcds
and
as
you
pointed
out
comes
in
several
different
colors
many
of
them
emit
whiteish
colors
true
white
and
bluewhiteisblue
are
the
ones
that
ive
personally
encountered
the
most
often
they
vary
in
their
input
requirements
however
they
tend
to
operate
at
about
vrms
and
at
much
higher
than
hz
hz
to
khz
if
i
recall
correctly
you
can
get
them
to
work
at
vrms
hz
ie
line
but
they
dont
glow
as
brightly
and
they
will
degrade
much
faster
oh
yes
almost
forgot
els
have
this
tendency
to
wear
out
over
time
