so
whats
the
story
here
were
all
stuck
with
the
regular
green
red
and
off
yelloworange
leds
what
gives
anybody
have
a
scoop
on
fairly
low
priced
blue
leds
if
your
looking
for
leds
in
the
range
forget
it
blue
leds
just
recently
became
available
and
the
materials
they
are
made
of
are
expensive
maybe
in
the
future
they
will
become
less
expensive
and
brighter
but
for
now
its
going
to
cost
you
and
the
output
will
be
limited
if
they
ever
do
get
as
efficient
and
cost
effective
as
red
and
green
leds
youre
probably
going
to
see
a
whole
new
family
of
color
displays
