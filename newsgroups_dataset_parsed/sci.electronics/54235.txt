STEVE
MADSEN
WRITES
THIS
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
I
UPGRADED
MY
MOTHERBOARD
LAST
FALL
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
PISSED
AT
ANY
SOFTWARE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
FORCED
ME
TO
REINSTALL
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
I
CHANGED
MOTHERBOARDS
OPINION
IS
UNDERSTANDABLE
I
ASSUME
YOU
HAVE
A
TAPE
DRIVE
NOT
ALL
OF
US
HAVE
ABOUT
FLOPPIES
AROUND
FOR
BACKUP
YOU
KNOW
ACTUALLY
NO
I
DONT
HAVE
A
TAPE
DRIVE
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
A
TOTAL
HARD
DISK
FAILURE
I
REINSTALL
THE
APPS
FROM
ORIGINALS
AND
RESTORE
THE
DATA
FROM
THE
BACKUPS
I
KEEP
OF
THAT
WITH
UPWARDS
OF
OF
STUFF
ON
MY
HARD
DISK
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
IM
GOING
TO
TRY
AND
BACK
IT
ALL
UP
WITHOUT
A
TAPE
DRIVE
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
HAVE
ONE
THOUGH
RAM
IS
SOMETHING
YOU
ADD
ALL
THE
TIME
SO
NO
ITS
MORE
LIKE
BIOS
MANUFACTURER
ANDOR
PROCESSOR
TYPE
DATA
CANNOT
BE
USED
ESP
WITH
THESE
NEW
FLASH
ROM
BIOS
MACHINES
WITH
UPDATES
ON
A
DISKETTE
MAYBE
MAYBE
NOT
TODAY
IT
DOESNT
HAPPEN
AS
OFTEN
I
WOULD
HOPE
BUT
THEN
IF
A
BIOS
IS
BUGGY
AND
THE
USER
GETS
AN
UPGRADE
THE
BIOS
INFORMATION
IS
GOING
TO
CHANGE
AT
LEAST
THE
DATE
ANYWAY
TAGGING
THE
BIOS
MANUFACTURER
IS
STILL
GOING
TO
FALSELY
TAG
THOSE
USERS
WHO
UPGRADE
THE
MOTHERBOARD
THIS
TYPE
OF
UPGRADE
DOESNT
REQUIRE
A
HARD
DISK
BACKUPRESTORE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
TO
MAKE
THIS
LESS
INTRUSIVE
IT
COULD
BE
DISGUISED
AS
PLEASE
INSERT
ORIGINAL
DISK
XX
AS
I
NEED
FILE
YYYYYY
FOR
UPDATE
IT
WOULD
BE
PERFECTLY
REASONABLE
SORT
OF
AS
LONG
AS
IT
WASNT
DONE
TOO
TERRIBLY
OFTEN
OTHERWISE
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
GET
ANNOYING
AND
THE
USER
WOULD
GO
LOOKING
FOR
OTHER
SOFTWARE
THIS
IS
SILLY
ITS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
LOAN
DISKS
TO
A
FRIEND
AND
LET
THEM
DO
AN
INSTALL
THAN
TO
BACKUP
YOUR
COPY
ALREADY
ON
DISK
AND
THEN
GIVE
THEM
THAT
YOUR
SCHEME
ISNT
GOING
TO
STOP
ANYONE
OF
COURSE
IT
IS
EASIER
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THEN
THE
ORIGINALS
SHOULD
ALLOW
ONLY
ONE
INSTALL
WHAT
IS
YOUR
POINT
OF
COURSE
NOT
IF
SOMETHING
GETS
CORRUPTED
AND
MY
APP
NEEDS
TO
BE
REINSTALLED
THE
WORST
THING
I
WANT
THAT
SOFTWARE
TELLING
ME
IS
THIS
SOFTWARE
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
REGISTERED
TO
BLANK
AND
IT
IS
AGAINST
THE
LAW
TO
INSTALL
IT
ON
OTHER
MACHINES
OR
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
ACCESS
FOR
WINDOWS
DOES
THIS
AND
IT
ONLY
REQUIRES
A
CLICK
ON
OK
TO
GO
AWAY
PRETTY
NONINTRUSIVE
BUT
IT
GETS
THE
POINT
ACROSS
WHAT
I
SAID
WAS
THE
PROGRAM
SHOULD
HAVE
CERTAIN
RESTRICTION
SUCH
AS
THE
RESTRICTTOONEMACHINE
UNTIL
THE
PROGRAM
IS
REGISTERED
WITH
THE
MANUFACTURER
THE
MANUFACTURER
WILL
THEN
SUPPLY
THE
THENPROVENLEGITIMATEUSER
WITH
A
PATCH
THAT
WILL
DISABLE
THE
RESTRICTION
AND
PROUDLY
PROCLAIM
THE
LEGAL
COPY
WITH
THE
REGISTERED
TO
XXX
SCREEN
THIS
IS
A
GREAT
IDEA
I
LIKE
THE
KEY
SYSTEM
THAT
SOME
SHAREWARE
PRODUCTS
USE
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
DIFFICULT
FOR
BIG
SOFTWARE
COMPANIES
TO
IMPLEMENT
THIS
WITHOUT
IT
GETTING
VERY
COSTINEFFECTIVE
FOR
THEM
AND
MORE
OF
A
BURDEN
THAN
A
BENEFIT

THE
USERS
