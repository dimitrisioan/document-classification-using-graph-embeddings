FOR

JOHN
ACKERMANN
X
WROTE
MY
NEXT
PROJECT
IS
TO
COME
UP
WITH
AN
IFDETECTOR
MODULE
FOR
FAST
TO
KBSEC
PACKET
RADIO
USE
NO
FANCY
MODULATION
SCHEME
JUST
WIDE
FSK
FOR
USE
AT
OR
MHZ
IM
A
BIT
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
MOTOROLA
CHIP
BUT
I
WONDER
IF
THERE
ARE
NEWER
DESIGNS
THAT
MIGHT
WORK
AT
HIGHER
INPUT
FREQUENCIES
MY
GOAL
IS
TO
COME
UP
WITH
AN
INEXPENSIVE
DESIGN
FOR
A
RECEIVER
BACK
END
WITH
IF
INPUT
ON
ONE
END
AND
AN
FSK
DEMONDULATOR
ON
THE
OTHER
IM
PARTICULARLY
INTERESTED
IN
WAYS
TO
USE
A
HIGHER
IF
THAN
DO
ANY
CURRENT
CHIPS
WORK
UP
TO
SAY
WITH
INTERNAL
DOWNCONVERSION
SO
A
NORMAL
IF
FILTER
CAN
BE
USED
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
JOHN
WHAT
YOU
DESCRIBE
IS
VERY
CLOSE
TO
WHAT
I
BUILT
AND
DESCRIBED
IN
THE
ARRL
COMPUTER
NETWORK
CONFERENCE
PROCEEDINGS
I
BUILT
WATT
FSK
TRANSCEIVERS
AT
MHZ
THEY
ARE
ESSENTIALLY
DOUBLE
CONVERSION
TRANSVERTERS
WITH
DIGITAL
MOD
AND
DEMOD
AT
MHZ
THE
RECEIVER
USES
THE
WHICH
IS
THE
SAME
FSK
RECEIVER
CHIP
I
USED
PREVIOUSLYU
IN
THE
MBPS
GHZ
DATA
LINK
I
FIRST
PUBLISHED
IN
HAM
RADIO
AND
WHICH
IS
NOW
ALSO
IN
THE
ARRL
HANDBOOK
THE
WHICH
INCLUDES
A
VHF
CONVERTER
SECTION
COULD
ALSO
BE
USED
AT
THESE
SPEEDS
THERE
IS
A
NEWER
AND
PERHAPS
SLIGHTLY
IMPROVED
DESIGN
OF
THIS
THE
IF
I
REMEMBER
RIGHTLY
WHILE
USING
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
LET
ME
REDUCE
THE
EXTERNAL
IF
COUNT
ON
RECEIVE
IT
DIDNT
REALLY
OFFER
ALL
THAT
MUCH
HELP
ON
TRANSMIT
SO
I
DIDNT
BOTHER
WITH
IT
THE
RADIOS
I
BUILT
WERE
FIRST
DESIGNED
AND
BUILT
FOR
KBPS
IN
A
MHZ
CHANNEL
BUT
LATER
REDUCED
TO
HALF
THAT
THESE
KBPS
RADIOS
ACTUALLY
HAVE
DONE
QUITE
WELL
IN
ACROSSTHEBENCH
TESTS
AT
KBPS
AND
SPEED
IS
PRETTY
MUCH
A
FUNCTION
OF
FILTER
DESIGN
HANDLING
THE
DATA
STREAM
IS
ANOTHER
MATTER
ENTIRELY
SOME
OF
THE
EXISTING
RADIOS
ARE
CURRENTLY
DEPLOYED
ON
HILLTOPS
IN
A
BEACON
TEST
MODE
WHILE
THERE
IS
NOT
YET
ENDEND
TWOWAY
DATA
FLOW
DUE
TO
LACK
OF
RESOURCES
TO
DEBUG
SOFTWARE
FOR
THE
DIGITAL
HARDWARE
MIO
ALSO
SHOWN
IN
THE
CNC
PROCEEDINGS
DATA
IS
PERFECT
COPY
AT
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
DATA
CLOCK
IS
CURRENTLY
AT
ABOUT
HALF
SPEED
THE
A
KBYTES
OF
THE
TEST

CHAPTER
OF
ISAIAH
TAKES
ONLY
A
LITTLE
OVER
OF
A
SECOND
IVE
BEEN
HOPING
THAT
SOMEONE
WOULD
GET
INTERESTED
ENOUGH
TO
STEP
IN
AND
GET
INVOLVED
IN
WRITING
CODE
TO
MAKE
THE
WHOLE
THING
USABLE
BORLAND
IDE
ENVIRONMENT
WITH
REMOTE
DEBUGGING
POSSIBLE
AS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
PROCEEDINGS
BUT
TO
DATE
A
COUPLE
OF
US
HAVE
BEEN
ON
OUR
OWN
AND
RUNNING
LOW
ON
RESOURCES
OF
TIME
MONEY
AND
ENERGY
IF
ANYONE
IN
THE
SF

AREA
WANTS
TO
CHECK
IT
OUT
THERE
IS

ON

MTN
AND
BLACK
MTN
OVERLOOKING
SI
VALLEY
THE
ANTENNA
IS
HORIZONTALLY
POLARIZED
I
GUESS
IN
RETROSPECT
MY
SUGGESTIONS
ARE
THAT
THIS
IS
A
FAIRLY
COSTLY
APPROACH
IF
THE
RADIOS
ARE
INTENDED
FOR
USERS
RATHER
THAN
BACKBONES
AND
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
CAREFULLY
CONSIDER
YOUR
TARGET
IF
YOU
CANT
ARRANGE
YOUR
PATHS
SUCH
THAT
YOU
HAVE
COMPLETE
LINEOFSIGHT
I
THINK
YOULL
WANT
TO
ADDRESS
THE
