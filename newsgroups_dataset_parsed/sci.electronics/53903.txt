oversampling
cd
player
hello
i
just
bought
a
new
portable
cd
player
for
the
office
and
i
notice
that
it
proudly
proclaims
times
oversampling
on
the
box
now
while
i
think
i
understand
what
oversampling
is
the
rate
of
discrete
samples
exceeds
the
highest
frequency
component
of
interest
by
some
factor
i
dont
understand
this
times
business
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
bought
my
first
cd
player
was
it
really
years
ago
the
specs
said
times
could
someone
please
tell
me
whether
im
getting
senile
if
im
not
then
what
good
does
it
do
for
the
player
to
take
samples
at
a
higher
rate
if
i
really
wanted
better
fidelity
wouldnt
i
have
to
have
the
same
higher
rate
of
sampling
during
the
recording
process
furthermore
am
i
wrong
in
interpreting
the
sampling
rate
from
the
players
point
of
view
as
being
the
same
thing
as
the
data
rate
for
the
bit
stream
coming
off
the
optical
medium
does
this
mean
that
the
data
rate
related
to
the
rotational
speed
of
the
disk
has
changed
since
im
so
confused

world

fair

it
were

lot
worse
off
