phosphorescent
pads
a
while
ago
i
saw
some
translucent
pads
about
or
so
that
could
be
plugged
into
something
and
they
would
glow
one
was
red
another
green
another
blue
interresting
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
would
have
a
feed
on
anything
of
this
nature
and
of
the
price
oh
the
pads
were
rubberlike
and
were
floppy
like
about
thick
or
so
thanks
inspiration
comes
to
o
those
who
