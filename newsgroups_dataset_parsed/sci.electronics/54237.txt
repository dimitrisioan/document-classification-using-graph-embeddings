SCALING
BEING
IN
THE
VISUALIZATION
STAGE
OF
A
CIRCUIT
DESIGN
RIGHT
NOW
I
WAS
WONDERING
WHAT
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
SCALE
AN
AC
VOLTAGE
USING
AN
DIGITAL
WORD
IS
I
AM
THINKING
OF
USING
THE
COMMON
METHOD
OF
SENDING
THE
WORD
THROUGH
AN
ADC
AND
THEN
COMPARING
IT
WITH
THE
AC
VOLTAGE
CONVERTED
TO
A
SAWTOOTH
WAVE
TO
GET
A
DUTY
CYCLE
HOWEVER
I
AM
LEARY
OF
THIS
METHOD
BECAUSE
IT
A
REQUIRES
A
LOT
OF
PARTS
AND
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
B
CREATES
A
LOT
OF
INTERFERENCE
FROM
THE
SWITCHING
ON
THE
ENTIRE
AC
LINE
I
REALIZE
THAT
CORRECT
FILTERING
COULD
CANCEL
OUT
MOST
OF
THIS
INTERFERENCE
BUT
THAT
WOULD
REQUIRE
MORE
PARTS
AND
BOOST
THE
PRICE
FURTHER
SOMEONE
MENTIONED
TO
ME
THAT
THEY
HAD
SEEN
AN
IC
WHICH
INPUT
BITS
OF
DATA
AND
DIRECTLY
SCALED
THE
AC
VOLTAGE
COMING
IN
ALL
ONCHIP
UNFORTUNATELY
HE
COULDNT
REMEMBER
THE
CHIP
NUMBER
OR
THE
MANUFACTURER
IF
ANYONE
ELSE
HAS
HEARD
OF
THIS
CHIP
PLEASE
EMAIL
ME
I
AM
BUILDING
THIS
PROJECT
AS
A
DIMMER
BOX
FOR
A
LIGHT
CONTROLLER
CIRCUIT
AND
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
THAT
THE
COST
OF
EACH
BOX
REMAINS
VERY
LOW
BECAUSE
ONE
DIMMER
IS
REQUIRED
FOR
EACH
LIGHT
THAT
THE
USER
WISHES
TO
CONTROL
WELL
EACH
CHANNEL
AT
LEAST
THEREFOR
IF
EACH
BOX
COSTS
I
DOUBT
THAT
AN
END
USER
WILL
WANT
TO
DISH
OUT
X
FOR
SIXTEEN
CHANNELS
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
I
HAVE
NOTICED
ABOUT
TODAYS
DIMMER
BOXES
THEY
ARE
SO
EXPENSIVE
ANYWAY
ANY
HELP
WHICH
SOMEONE
COULD
OFFER
ON
EITHER
A
METHOD
OF
EASILY
DOING
THIS
OR
INFO
ABOUT
THE
CHIP
WHICH
WILL
DO
IT
FOR
ME
ALWAYS
THE
PREFERRED
METHOD
WILL
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
