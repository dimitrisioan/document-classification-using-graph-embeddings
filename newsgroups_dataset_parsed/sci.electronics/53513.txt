RE
NEED
HELP
WITH
CAR
STEREO
JUST
A
SHOT
HERE
BUT
YA
NEVER
KNOW
I
ONCE
BOUGHT
A
REAL
CHEAP
EQUALIZER
POWER
AMP
FOR
MY
CAR
TAPE
PLAYER
AT
ONE
OF
THOSE
MOTELROOM
TRUCKLOAD
SALES
AND
IT
SOUNDED
GREAT
FOR
A
WHILE
THAT
IS
THEN
ONE
CHANNEL
QUIT
ENTIRELY
I
OPENED
IT
UP
AND
THE
AMPLIFIER
CHIP
FOR
THE
BAD
CHANNEL
HAD
SIMPLY
MELTED
SOME
OF
ITS
SOLDER
JOINTS
ATTACHING
IT
TO
THE
PCB
I
SOLDERED
THEM
BACK
AND
IT
WORKED
FINE
I
JUST
HAD
TO
KEEP
THE
VOLUME
A
BIT
LOWER
THAN
I
DID
BEFORE
PROBABLY
LOUSY
HEAT
SINKING
YOU
SAID
A
NICE
ALPINE
WHICH
IM
SURE
IS
A
FEW
ORDERS
OF
MAG
HIGHER
IN
QUALITY
THAN
THE
POS
I
HAD
BUT
THE
POINT
IS
LOOK
INSIDE
BEFORE
YOU
SCRAP
IT
SINCE
YOU
OCCASIONALLY
FIND
SOMETHING
YOU
CAN
REPAIR
MAYBE
EVEN
THE
SAME
THING
I
FOUND
GOOD
LUCK
