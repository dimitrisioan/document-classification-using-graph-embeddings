EXPLODING
TV
I
HAD
A
GE
EMERSON
COLOR
TV
FOR
ABOUT
YEARS
AND
ONE
FINE
DAY
WHILE
WE
WERE
WATCHING
SOMETHING
I
DOUBT
IF
THE
PROGRAM
WAS
THE
CAUSE
WE
HEARD
A
MILD
EXPLOSION
OUR
SCREEN
WENT
BLANK
BUT
THERE
WAS
SOUND
SO
WE
THOUGHT
OH
WE
HAVE
SPECIAL
EFFECTS
ON
THE
PROGRAM
BUT
SOON
THE
SOUND
STOPPED
AND
SMOKE
STARTED
TO
APPEAR
AT
THE
BACK
OF
THE
TV
THE
BRILLIANT
EES
WE
ARE
WE
UNPLUGGED
THE
TV
AND
CALLED
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
ONLY
TO
BE
THROWN
AROUND
BY
PLEASE
HOLD
I
WILL
TRANSFER
U
TO
BLAH
BLAH
FINALLY
WE
ABANDONED
THE
IDEA
OF
TRYING
TO
FIX
THE
TV
AND
GOT
A
NEW
ONE
WE
WANTED
A
BIGGER
ONE
TOO
AFTER
ALL
THE
STORY
WHAT
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
IS
IS
MY
PROBLEM
AN
ISOLATED
INCIDENT
OR
A
COMMON
ONE
I
RECALL
READING
ABOUT
RUSSIAN
TVS
EXPLODING
BUT
NOT
HERE
IN
THE
US
WHY
WOULD
THE
PICTURE
TUBE
EXPLODE
OR
EVEN
SMOKE
I
STILL
HAVE
THE
LEFT
OVER
TV
SET
I
MIGHT
DIG
INTO
IT
THIS
SUMMER
ANY
IDEA
WHERE
I
CAN
GET
PARTS
FOR
THESE
THINGS
PROBABLY
WILL
COST
MORE
THAN
TV
