i
guess
what
i
am
saying
is
that
your
question
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
answer
what
exactly
do
you
want
to
know
do
you
need
a
good
one
for
a
project
you
are
working
on
how
secure
must
it
be
are
you
trying
to
crack
one
that
someone
else
has
used
i
can
probably
make
suggestions
assuming
the
activity
is
strictly
legal
in
general
it
is
a
bad
idea
legally
to
tamper
with
copy
protection
it
can
also
lead
to
corruption
of
files
which
you
necessarily
do
not
have
back
ups
of
being
as
they
are
copy
protected
which
can
be
devestating
do
you
have
absolutely
no
ideas
for
practical
applications
and
are
merely
curious
please
clear
up
those
questions
and
ill
try
to
help
as
much
as
i
can
may
we
interpret
this
as
an
offer
to
volunteer
as
editor
for
a
copy
protection
faq
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
am
not
alone
welcoming
such
an
initiative
i
will
volunteer
to
ask
some
of
the
questions
if
you
will
provide
the
answers
hey
now
will
you
stop
encouraging
him
copy
protection
only
serves
one
pur
pose
to
keep
the
honest
buyer
from
making
legal
backup
copies
it
will
definitely
not
stop
any
pirates
if
you
want
to
protect
you
soft
supply
a
good
documentation
and
support
this
is
imho
the
only
way
of
effectively
protecting
software
there
are
several
types
of
copy
protection
and
the
point
is
to
make
sure
the
user
is
using
a
legitimate
copy
the
simplest
and
virtually
foolproof
way
is
for
the
program
to
somehow
fixate
itself
to
the
machine
it
was
installed
on
some
sort
of
checksum
serial
number
whatever
so
a
copy
put
on
a
different
machine
not
installed
from
original
disks
will
not
work
the
program
is
definitely
backupable
if
restored
to
the
same
machine
depends
on
the
programmer
dont
use
a
disk
drive
characteristic
if
the
user
did
an
upgrade
to
the
machine
heshe
should
reinstall
all
programs
any
way
no
document
lookup
no
disk
wearandtear
i
did
not
say
that
the
originals
would
allow
only
one
install
the
users
conscience
should
do
that
i
know
ill
get
flamed
for
this
but
with
the
increasing
number
of
casual
users
who
either
unknowingly
or
dont
care
about
the
software
copyrights
its
the
truth
i
have
friends
who
ask
me
for
copies
of
my
latest
games
all
the
time
and
when
i
refused
they
went
after
somebody
else
casual
pirating
is
becoming
more
of
a
problem
some
sort
of
copy
protection
will
discourage
the
casual
copying
ive
seen
what
some
of
my
friends
dug
up
somewhere
latest
and
the
greatest
games
all
cracked
within
days
of
actual
release
you
know
how
many
bytes
you
need
to
change
in
xwing
to
disable
the
quiz
two
yes
two
and
dont
ask
me
which
ones
they
are
determined
pirates
are
unstoppable
given
enough
time
but
their
results
do
not
spread
that
far
since
pirate
boards
are
not
that
wellknown
and
easily
tracked
once
found
by
authorities
it
is
the
casual
pirates
that
the
copy
protection
is
determined
to
discourage
what
i
believe
the
companies
should
do
is
implement
the
above
plus
a
special
patch
once
the
user
registers
that
loudly
exclaims
upon
bootup
registered
to
xxxxx
address
city
state
zip
and
disables
the
above
two
benefits
encourages
registration
cuts
down
on
pirating
and
makes
it
more
traceable
because
if
the
patchs
registration
message
is
encrypted
it
will
be
quite
hard
to
change
and
therefore
provides
a
stable
trail
of
who
allowed
their
copy
out
of
their
hands
and
thus
violated
their
license
agreement
this
way
the
legitimate
users
who
does
not
register
will
experience
minimal
discomfort
who
does
major
upgrades
to
their
computer
frequently
as
only
problem
they
have
is
they
wont
be
able
to
restore
to
another
computer
the
registered
users
would
have
proven
they
are
legitmate
users
and
therefore
gains
full
rights
and
can
restore
to
different
machines
on
the
other
hand
the
software
company
now
have
a
record
of
where
this
particular
copy
is
supposed
to
be
if
this
users
copy
was
found
to
be
somewhere
it
was
not
supposed
to
be
we
know
who
has
broken
their
license
agreement
of
course
a
hacker
can
break
that
eventually
but
thats
not
the
point
is
it
kasey
chang
