RE
HOW
TO
THE
DISKS
COPY
PROTECTED
I
STILL
THINK
A
MAJOR
POINT
IS
BEING
MISSED
IF
YOU
ARE
WORRIED
ABOUT
SOFTWARE
PIRATES
NOTHING
WILL
STOP
THEM
THESE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
CRACK
SOFTWARE
MOSTLY
GAMES
BUT
SO
WHAT
DAILY
FOR
FUN
THEY
CAN
USUALLY
FIND
A
CRACK
AROUND
ANYTHING
ESPECIALLY
IF
THE
MANUFACTURER
LEAVES
A
HOLE
FOR
SUCH
A
THING
ARE
WE
HAVING
FUN
YET
