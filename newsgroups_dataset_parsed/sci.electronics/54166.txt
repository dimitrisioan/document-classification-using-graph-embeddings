RE
MULTIPLE
INPUTS
FOR
PC
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
CAN
ANYONE
OFFER
A
SUGGESTION
ON
A
PROBLEM
I
AM
HAVING
I
HAVE
SEVERAL
BOARDS
WHOSE
SOLE
PURPOSE
IS
TO
DECODE
DTMF
TONES
AND
SEND
THE
RESULTANT
IN
ASCII
TO
A
PC
THESE
BOARDS
RUN
ON
THE
SERIAL
INTERFACE
I
NEED
TO
RUN
OF
THE
BOARDS
SOMWEHAT
SIMULTANEOUSLY
I
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
HO
OK
THEM
UP
TO
A
PC
THE
PROBLEM
IS
HOW
DO
I
HOOK
UP
SERIAL
DEVICES
TO
ONE
PC
INEXPENSIVLEY
SO
THAT
ALL
CAN
SEND
DATA
SIMULATANEOUSLY
OR
CLOSE
TO
IT
ANY
HELP
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
ARE
THE
BOARDS
AT
ALL
INTELLIGENT
IE
RUN
BY
MICROCONTROLLERS
THE
EASIEST
THING
WOULD
BE
TO
HAVE
ANOTHER
LINE
THAT
SAYS
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
BOARDS
IS
TALKING
TO
THE
PC
WHEN
THIS
LINE
WAS
TRUE
THE
OTHER
BOARDS
COULD
ALL
HOLD
OFF
AND
NOT
SEND
THEIR
DATA
THIS
ISNT
A
PERFECT
SOLUTION
THOUGH
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
TO
WORRY
A
LITTLE
ABOUT
MAKING
SURE
TWO
BOARDS
DONT
DECIDE
TO
TALK
AT
THE
EXACT
SAME
TIME
OTHER
THAN
THAT
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
NEED
TO
HOOK
UP
EACH
BOARD
TO
SOMETHING
THAT
SPEAKS
THIS
ACTUALLY
ISNT
AS
HARD
OR
AS
EXPENSIVE
AS
IT
USED
TO
BE
THOUGH
ASSUMING
THE
BOARDS
TALK
RELATIVELY
SLOWLY
BPS
OR
SLOWER
THE
PICS
CAN
COORDINATE
THINGS
BETWEEN
THEMSELVES
TO
MULTIPLEX
THE
DATA
THIS
IS
REALLY
JUST
FORBICLY
ADDING
THE
SUGGESTION
IN
THE
FIRST
PARAGRAPH
TO
YOUR
SYSTEM
AND
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
EACH
BOARD
DOESNT
TALK
MORE
THAN
OF
THE
TIME
OF
FOR
VERY
LONG
SINCE
A
PIC
ISNT
GOING
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BUFFER
MORE
THAN
MAYBE
BYTES
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
CHECK
INTO
THE
PRICES
OF
MULTISERIAL
CARD
FOR
YOUR
PC
THOUGH
I
RECENTLY
BOUGHT
A
BOCA
RESEARCH
CARD
PARALLEL
PORTS
PORTS
FOR
A
VERY
REASONABLE
JOEL
KOLSTAD
