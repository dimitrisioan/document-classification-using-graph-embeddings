i
would
like
to
be
able
to
detect
the
angular
position
low
accuracy
of
an
ir
emitting
source
at
a
distance
of
about
meters
more
is
better
in
daylight
the
ir
source
could
be
emitting
a
signature
im
leaning
toward
khz
square
wave
with
duty
cycle
i
am
considering
the
use
of
a
quadrant
detector
from
centronic
inc
to
give
information
to
a
pantilt
head
to
point
the
sensor
and
thus
determine
the
angles
for
the
source
i
am
considering
wazing
the
heck
out
of
an
ir
leds
possibly
an
optek
or
motorola
wazing
would
mean
at
least
amp
current
pulses
at
this
current
the
duty
cycle
of
the
led
drops
to
and
i
would
need
to
cycle
five
of
them
in
turn
to
get
the
required
has
anyone
done
something
like
this
why
dont
you
just
run
one
led
at
khz
and
use
a
flip
flop
at
the
receiving
end
to
divide
by
and
give
you
a
good
square
signal
just
a
thought
