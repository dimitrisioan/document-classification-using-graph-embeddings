while
its
possible
that
its
a
ham
radio
transmitter
that
youre
hearing
it
isnt
likely
every
bit
of
signal
that
doesnt
go
out
the
antenna
is
wasted
as
far
as
a
ham
is
concerned
and
most
hams
are
it
is
the
radiated
signal
that
would
cause
the
problem
technically
competent
to
ensure
that
they
dont
waste
any
signal
if
they
can
possibly
avoid
it
to
get
their
ham
license
they
had
to
pass
a
government
exam
that
tests
them
on
that
point
among
others
however
you
could
be
hearing
a
radio
transmitter
for
sure
there
are
lots
of
other
services
where
the
operators
arent
required
to
be
technically
competent
citizens
band
cb
for
example
there
is
nothing
in
the
amateur
radio
tests
that
requires
an
technical
competence
at
all
it
is
a
simple
matter
to
memorize
all
the
questions
and
answers
however
that
said
most
hams
that
i
know
do
spend
quite
a
bit
of
time
gaining
some
technical
skill
listen
to
the
interference
if
you
hear
voices
clearly
it
almost
certainly
isnt
ham
radio
and
might
well
be
cb
if
you
can
record
a
dont
count
on
that
bit
of
it
you
could
take
the
tape
over
to
a
local
ham
operators
house
and
ask
him
for
his
opinion
of
what
youre
hearing
most
communities
you
cannot
do
that
legally
however
you
can
ask
a
ham
over
to
listen
if
the
interference
occurs
at
a
specific
time
each
day
then
it
would
be
possible
to
do
such
scheduling
if
nothing
else
you
could
invite
the
ham
over
to
transmit
from
your
driveway
to
see
if
he
interferes
if
he
does
then
you
probably
need
to
have
your
equipment
worked
on
to
make
it
immune
to
rf
interference
have
a
ham
radio
interference
committee
whose
members
are
most
willing
to
help
you
resolve
interference
complaints
look
in
the
phone
book
or
ask
at
the
local
ham
radio
store
or
call
the
fcc
for
contact
info
the
fcc
may
or
may
not
have
such
information
they
have
enough
to
do
without
getting
calls
for
such
information
if
nothing
else
call
your
city
offices
or
police
department
general
business
number
they
should
have
the
name
of
a
local
ham
contact
if
its
a
ham
hes
more
than
likely
willing
to
help
get
rid
of
the
problem
after
all
it
would
be
his
signal
hes
wasting
if
it
isnt
the
interference
committee
or
the
fcc
may
be
able
to
suggest
solutions
see
above
your
concept
of
wasted
signal
is
erroneous
if
his
rig
is
transmitting
properly
then
the
chance
of
interference
with
the
exception
of
harmonic
television
interference
is
the
greatest
since
he
is
putting
out
the
strongest
signal
it
is
unfortunately
the
case
that
a
transmitting
station
that
is
operating
perfectly
legally
could
possibly
cause
intereference
to
a
piece
of
consumer
audio
or
tv
equipment
just
because
the
manufacturer
of
the
consumer
equipment
cut
corners
on
one
little
section
of
the
device
that
wouldnt
affect
one
person
in
a
thousand
but
which
bites
you
often
that
can
be
remedied
for
just
a
few
pennies
by
a
knowledgeable
person
perhaps
even
the
person
operating
the
transmitter
youre
hearing
unfortunately
most
consumer
equipment
is
succeptable
it
is
all
poorly
designed
btw
hams
are
allowed
amplifiers
cb
isnt
illegal
ham
amplifier
doesnt
compute
it
does
but
not
for
a
mobile
radio
there
are
very
few
mobile
rigs
that
could
power
a
watt
amplifier
bill
