I
AM
CONSIDERING
THE
USE
OF

TO
GIVE

DETERMINE

I
AM
CONSIDERING
WAZING

A
METHOD
WHICH
WILL
DIRECTLY
ALMOST
PROVIDE
YOU
WITH
THE

THAT
YOU

IS
THAT

IS
COMMONLY
USED
FOR
COORDINATE

OF

EG
THE

SYSTEM
BY
SELSPOT

SWEDEN

THE

THESE
USE
LATERAL

DETECTORS
LINDHOLM

AND

TO
DETERMINE
THE
POSITION
OF
A
SPOT
OF
LIGHT
PROJECTED
USING
A

LENS
OVER
ITS
SURFACE
IN

THE
DETECTOR
IS
A
LARGE
PHOTODIODE
WITH
FOUR
CATHODES
ONE
ON
EACH
OF
THE
FOUR
SIDES
OF
THE
SQUARE
DETECTOR
CRYSTAL
AND
A
SINGLE
ANODE
THE
BACK
OF
THE

A
SPOT
OF

WILL
PRODUCE

ARE
PROPORTIONAL

IF
THE

THEN
THE

IS
GIVEN
BY
THIS

REGARDLESS

THE

WHEN
THIS

IS
USED
IN
THE

OF

THE
WAY
OF
TUNING

IS
TO
