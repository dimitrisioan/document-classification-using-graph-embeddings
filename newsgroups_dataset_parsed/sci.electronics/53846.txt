i
would
like
to
be
able
to
detect
the
angular
position
low
accuracy
of
an
ir
emitting
source
at
a
distance
of
about
meters
more
is
better
in
daylight
the
ir
source
could
be
emitting
a
signature
im
leaning
toward
khz
square

with
duty

i
am
considering
the
use
of
a
quadrant
detector
from
centronic
inc
to
give
information
to
a
pantilt
head
to
point
the
sensor
and
thus
determine
the
angles
for
the
source
i
am
considering
wazing
the
heck
out
of
an
ir

possibly
an
optek
or
motorola
wazing
would
mean
at
least
amp
current
pulses
at
this
current
the
duty

of
the
led
drops
to
and
i
would
need
to
cycle
five
of
them
in
turn
to
get
the
required
has
anyone
done
something

a
method
which
will
directly
almost
provide
you
with
the
information
that
you
require
is
that
which
is
commonly
used
for
coordinate
measurements
of
human
body
landmarks
eg
the
selspot
system
by
selspot
ab
sweden
and
the
watsmart
system
these
use
lateral
photoeffect
detectors
lindholm
and
oberg
woltring
and
marsolais
to
determine
the
position
of
a
spot
of
light
projected
using
a
camera
lens
over
its
surface
in
escence
the
detector
is
a
large
photodiode
with
four
cathodes
one
on
each
of
the
four
sides
of
the
square
detector
crystal
and
a
single
anode
the
back
of
the
crystal
a
spot
of
light
will
produce
currents
which
are
proportional
to
the
position
of
the
spot
on
the
detectors
face
lets
try
some
ascii
graphics
in
so
the
detector
has
two
cathodes
to
detect

if
the
dot
of
light
from
the
led
is
the
only
source
of
light
then
the
position
of
the
projection
is
given
by
this
circuit
regardless
of
the
level
of
illumina
tion
the
divider
is
used
to
normalize
relative
to
total
received
power
when
this
circuit
is
used
in
the
presence
of
other
sources
of
light
then
the
way
of
tuning
to
it
is
to
sample
for
a
few
msec
the
background
signal
light
the
led
for
an
equal
time
and
sample
that
signal
separately
the
difference
between
the
two
is
the
position
of
the
led
hamamatsu
photonics
sells
linear
and
lateral
photoeffect
detectors
and
they
also
sell
the
required
signal
processing
electronics
the
readymade
systems
by
selspot
and
others
are
not
cheap

most
probably
this
technique
can
provide
you
with
a
much
more
accurate
measurement
than
you
need
but
i
think
that
its
simplicity
beats
scanning
a
quadrant
detector
with
a
pantilt
system
until
you
reach
zero
