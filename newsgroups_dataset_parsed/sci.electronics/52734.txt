WRITES
THE
MANUAL
ALSO
GOT
INTO
THE
COSINE
EFFECT
WHEREIN
THE
MOTORIST
ALWAYS
GETS
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
DOUBT
EFFECTIVELY
DEPENDING
ON
RELATIVE
DIRECTIONS
OF
THE
RADAR
GUN
AND
TARGET
CAR
THE
READING
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
THE
SAME
AS
OR
LOWER
THAN
THE
ACTUAL
SPEED
OF
THE
CAR
NEVER
HIGHER
AND
ALWAYS
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
COP
DOESNT
EVEN
NEED
RADAR
TO
TICKET
YOU
HIS
HER
WORD
AS
A
SKILLED
OBSERVER
IS
ENOUGH
THE
FATHER
OF
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IS
A
POLICE
OFFICER
IN
WEST
VIRGINIA
NOT
ONLY
IS
HIS
WORD
AS
A
SKILLED
OBSERVER
GOOD
IN
COURT
BUT
HIS
SKILL
AS
AN
OBSERVER
HAS
BEEN
TESTED
TO
BE
MORE
ACCURATE
THAN
THE
RADAR
GUN
IN
SOME
CASES
NO
FOOLIN
HE
CAN
GUESS
A
CARS
SPEED
TO
WITHIN
JUST
BY
WATCHING
IT
BLOW
BY
WHETHER
HES
STANDING
STILL
OR
MOVING
TOO
YES
I
REALIZE
THAT
CALIBRATED
GUNS
ARE
MORE
ACCURATE
THAN
THIS
BUT
HIS
ABILITY
IS
NOT
THAT
UNCOMMON
AMONG
PEOPLE
WHO
WATCH
MOVING
THINGS
FOR
A
LIVING
I
HAVE
HEARD
SO
WHAT
GOOD
IS
A
RADAR
DETECTOR
EXCEPT
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
SPLIT
SECOND
WARNING
THAT
THE
GUY
WHO
JUST
CUT
YOU
OFF
TO
PASS
THE
GUY
AHEAD
AND
TO
YOUR
LEFT
IS
ABOUT
TO
PANIC
STOP
