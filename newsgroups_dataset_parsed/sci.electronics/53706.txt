JASON

SAID
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
OLD
TO
ALL
ON
JH
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
PEOPLE
HAD
ANY
GOOD
USES
FOR
OLD
JH
SIMMS
I
HAVE
A
BUNCH
OF
THEM
FOR
THE
APPLE
MAC
JH
AND
I
KNOW
LOTS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
DO
TO
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
JH
SELL
THEM
BUT
HAVE
GOTTEN
NO
INTEREST
HOW
ABOUT
COLLECTING
THEM
ALL
TOGETHER
IE
EVERYONES
AND
SELLING
THEM
AS
A
LOT
THE
OTHER
THING
IS
TO
GIVE
TO
A
RECYCLER
JH
SO
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
INOVATIVE
USE
OR
WANT
TO
BUY
JH
SOME
SIMMS
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
JH
ABOUT
IT
IF
THEY
ARE
FREE
AND
YOU
CAN
SEND
THEM
REAL
CHEAP
I
WOULD
BE
INTRESTED
IN
THEM
HEHEHE
ARE
THESE
CHIP
OR
CHIP
DEVICES
WHAT
SPEED
JH
I
HAVE
SEEN
RAM
DISC
STORAGE
DEVICES
BUT
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
JH
VERY
PRICEY
PLUS
I
AM
STILL
A
LITTLE
WORRIED
ABOUT
HAVING
DATA
JH
STORED
ON
RAM
WHY
DO
YOU
USE
A
RAM
