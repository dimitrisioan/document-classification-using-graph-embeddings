while
im
on
the
net
bugging
everyone
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
chip
or
chipset
to
decode
code
barcode
i
ask
for
a
couple
of
reasons
mainly
i
want
a
reasonably
compact
encoding
scheme
to
write
information
on
magstripe
cards
and
code
appears
to
be
about
right
if
the
right
way
to
do
it
is
something
else
and
its
reasonably
easy
can
someone
let
me
know
i
might
not
get
a
chance
to
reply
too
quickly
to
this
or
my
earlier
post
but
ill
get
to
them
within
a
couple
days
i
think
thanx
everyone
