MR
Y
WRITES
I
AM
NOT
QUITE
SO
SURE
ABOUT
THE
ILLEGALITY
OF
USING
A
REGULAR
AMERICAN
PHONE
ON
YOUR
HOME
SYSTEM
I
VAGUELY
REMEMBER
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
DEUTSCHE
BUNDESPOST
SPLIT
INTO
POSTDIENST
POSTBANK
AND
TELEKOM
THERE
WAS
SOME
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
A
NEW
REGULATION
I
KNOW
THAT
CORDLESS
OR
CELLULAR
PHONES
STILL
HAVE
TO
BE
APPROVED
BY
THE
TELEKOM
BUT
DOES
THAT
HOLD
TRUE
FOR
REGULAR
PHONES
IN
MY
AREACODE
IN
GERMANY
FRECHEN
NEAR
KOELN
YOU
CAN
USE
YES
IT
DOES
ALL
THE
EQUIPMENT
HAS
TO
HAVE
THAT
TELEKOM
APPROVAL
NUMBER
TO
BE
LEGAL
WHAT
HAS
CHANGED
IS
THAT
YOU
CAN
BUY
THE
EQUIPMENT
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
IM
PRETTY
SURE
THE
SAME
HOLDS
TRUE
IN
SWEDEN
AT
LEAST
WHEN
I
READ
SOME
INFORMATION
ON
IT
ABOUT
TWEO
YEARS
AGO
AND
BTW
I
DO
KNOW
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
LINES
IN
SWEDEN
CAN
HANDLE
TONEDIALING
JUST
DONT
BE
SURE
THAT
ALL
CAN
