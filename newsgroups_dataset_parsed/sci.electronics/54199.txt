RE
HOW
TO
THE
DISKS
COPY
PROTECTED
THIS
HAS
BEEN
AN
INTERESTING
THREAD
TO
FOLLOW
AND
OBVIOUSLY
THIS
GROUP
WASNT
INTENDED
AS
A
FORUM
FOR
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
PIRACY
HAS
ANYONE
SEEN
ANY
ESTIMATES
OF
THE
LOST
REVENUE
DUE
TO
PIRATES
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
PIRACY
IS
MORE
RAMPANT
IN
HOME
OR
CORPORATE
COMPUTING
ENVIRONMENTS
I
WOULD
TEND
TO
THINK
THAT
BUSINESS
ENVIRONMENT
PIRACY
IS
THE
MAJOR
CONTRIBUTOR
TO
THIS
FORM
OF
LOST
REVENUE
SO
MANY
COMPANIES
WILL
PURCHASE
A
FEW
COPIES
OF
A
SOFTWARE
PACKAGE
AND
THEN
EMPLOYEES
WILL
INTERNALLY
DISTRIBUTE
THEM
AS
IF
THEY
OWNED
A
SITELICENSE
WHAT
DO
YOU
GUYS
THINK
