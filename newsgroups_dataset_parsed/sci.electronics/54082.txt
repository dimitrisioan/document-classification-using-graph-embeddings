THIS
TOPIC
WAS
BEATEN
TO
DEATH
A
YEAR
OR
SO
AGO
THE
CONCRETE
IS
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
LEADACID
BATTERIES
OFTEN
FAIL
FROM
DISUSE
NOT
BEING
CHARGED
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BUT
THERES
NO
WAY
THE
CONCRETE
FLOOR
COULD
BE
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
DITTO
THE
ONLY
REMOTE
AND
I
DO
SAY
REMOTE
POSSIBILITY
IS
THAT
IF
THE
GROUND
WAS
REAL
COLD
THE
BATTERY
MIGHT
FREEZE
AN
SPLIT
BUT
THEN
IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
FREEZE
ANYWAY
