RE
UNINTERRUPTIBLE
POWER
SUPPLY
IM
NO
EXPERT
AT
UPSS
BUT
YOU
SAID
SOMETHING
THAT
MADE
IT
SOUND
LIKE
YOU
DIDNT
REALIZE
SOMETHING
ON
A
TYPICAL
UPS
WELL
ON
OURS
ANYWAY
THERE
IS
NO
SWITCHOVER
FROM
AC
TO
DC
ALL
THE
PROTECTED
EQUIPMENT
IS
ALWAYS
RUNNING
FROM
THE
BATTERIES
VIA
AN
INVERTER
WITH
THE
USUAL
CONDITION
OF
ALSO
HAVING
THEM
ON
CHARGE
IF
THE
POWER
FAILS
BIG
DEAL
THE
COMPUTERS
NEVER
SEE
IT
UNTIL
THE
BATTERIES
START
TO
DROOP
BUT
THERES
SOMETHING
LIKE
CARSIZED
BATTERIES
IN
THAT
CABINET
SO
IT
TAKES
A
WHILE
IF
YOU
WERE
GONNA
RUN
THE
GUTS
ON
STRAIGHT
DC
INSTEAD
OF
AN
INVERTER
WHY
NOT
DO
IT
ALL
THE
TIME
THEN
THERED
BE
NO
SWITCHOVER
TO
SCREW
THINGS
UP
AND
NO
HAVING
TO
SENSE
THE
FAILURE
FAST
JUST
KEEP
THE
DC
ON
CHARGE
WHEN
THE
POWER
IS
ON
AND
ITLL
BE
THERE
IN
ZERO
TIME
WHEN
YOU
NEED
IT
JUST
SOME
IDEAS
CANT
GUARANTEE
WHATLL
WORK
OR
NOT
BUT
HOPE
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THIS
HELPED
