WRITES
NOT
THAT
THE
QUESTION
IS
ANYTHING
IMPORTANT
BUT
I
AM
STILL
CURIOUS
WHY
IS
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
PRINTED
CIRCUIT
BOARDS
ARE
GREEN
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
FEW
BLUE
ONES
BUT
NO
RED
YELLOW
COMPANY
LOGO
ETC
IS
THERE
A
TECHNICAL
REASON
OR
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
THE
MARKETING
GENIUSES
HAVE
NOT
TOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
YET
JUHA
THE
COLOR
OF
THE

SHOWS
THE

OF
IT

EVOLVED
MORE

DEMANDS
WERE
MADE
OF

FIRST
BOARDS
WERE
USED
MAINLY
IN
AUDIO
CIRCUITRY
COULDNT
BE
USED
IN
HIGH

BECAUSE
IT

ARC

BURN
MOST
BOARDS
TODAY

FIBERGLASS
THE
TYPE
BEING
CHOSEN

BOARDS

SATELLITE
AND
MICROWAVE
COMMUNICATION
ARE
TEFLON
AND
CERAMIC
AS
THE
FIBERGLASS
AND
OTHER
BOARDS
ARE
CONDUCTIVE
THEY
ACTUALLY
WORK
MORE
AS
A
CAPACITIVE
DIALECTRIC
