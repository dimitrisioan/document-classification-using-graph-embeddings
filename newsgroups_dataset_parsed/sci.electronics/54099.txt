are

not
that
the
question
is
anything
important
but
i
am
still
curious
why
is
that
almost
all
printed
circuit
boards
are
green
i
have
seen
a
few
blue
ones
but
no
red
yellow
company
logo
etc
is
there
a
technical
reason
or
could
it
be
that
the
marketing
geniuses
have
not
tought
about
it
yet
juha
the
color
of
the
board
shows
the
composition
of
it
hence
the
use
of
it
original
and
older
boards
were
bakelite
composition
and
were
brown
phenolic
spelling
was
a
tan
most
non
filled
fiberglass
boards
used
in
computers
are
green
filled
fiberglass
is
blue
teflon
is
white
as
boards
evolved
more
and
more
demands
were
made
of
them
first
boards
were
used
mainly
in
audio
circuitry
couldnt
be
used
in
high
voltage
or
rf
because
it
would
arc
and
burn
most
boards
today
are
fiberglass
the
type
being
chosen
by
its
use
and
cost
boards
in
satellite
and
microwave
communication
are
teflon
and
ceramic
as
the
fiberglass
and
other
boards
are
conductive
they
actually
work
more
as
a
capacitive
dialectric
but
the
word
conductive
simplifies
explaination
at
the
high
frequencies
another
printed
circuit
material
used
mainly
in
automotive
and
interconnections
is
a
thin
flexible
mostly
mylar
material
and
is
used
to
connect
the
front
of
the
vehicle
etc
to
the
back
instead
of
wiring
harnesses
camcorders
use
this
to
intereconnect
the
boards
inside
where
wires
would
be
a
nuisance
am
working
on
a
generator
made
by
hewlet
packard
right
now
and
the
entire
board
is
gold
plated
boy
it
looks
expensive
hope
i
got
most
of
my
facts
right
as
i
am
working
from
memory
of
material
read
