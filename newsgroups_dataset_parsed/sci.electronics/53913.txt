CHRIS

WRITES
WELL
MY
HOUSE
WAS
BUILT
JUST
LAST
YEAR
AND
THE
BREAKER
BOX
IS
WIRED
THE
SAME
WAY
ALL
THE
WHITE
AND
GROUND
WIRES
ARE
ON
A
COMMON
BUS
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
CIRCUITS
ONLY
BLACK
WIRES
ARE
HOOKED
TO
THE
BREAKERS
IT
WAS
THE
SAME
WAY
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
HOUSES
I
HAD
ALSO
ARE
YOU
SURE
THIS
IS
WRONG
I
STILL
HAVE
THE
BUILDING
INSPECTORS
SIGNATURE
ON
THE
BREAKER
BOX
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
WAS
TALKING
ABOUT
CONNECTING
GROUND
AND
NEUTRAL
IN
THE
OUTLET
BOX
BIG
NO
NO
AND
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THEM
BEING
CONNECTED
IN
THE
BREAKER
BOX
AS
THINGS
SHOULD
BE
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
OBVIOUS
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
CURRENT
FLOW
IN
THE
WHITE
IE
NEUTRALRETURN
WIRES
WHEN
THINGS
IN
THE
HOUSE
ARE
OPERATING
THERE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ANY
FLOW
IN
THE
GROUND
WIRES
UNLESS
THERE
IS
A
FAULT
CONDITION
NOTICE
ALSO
THAT
IN
THE
BREAKER
BOX
THERE
IS
A
WIRE
LEADING
FROM
THE
ABOVEMENTIONED
JUNCTION
TO
EARTH
GROUND
USUALLY
A
PIPE
OR
SPIKE
DRIVEN
INTO
THE
GROUND
