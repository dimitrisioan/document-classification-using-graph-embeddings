THE

ERIC
RICHARD
NOEL
WRITES
I
STRONGLY
DISAGREE
I
THINK
MOST
PIRATING
IS
DONE
BY
AMATEURS
WHO
WONT
COPY
THE
PROGRAM
IF
DISKCOPY
CANT
DO
IT
I
HATE
TO
DISAGREE
BUT
I
WILL
NOTE
I
DONT
PIRATE
SOFTWARE
NOR
DO
I
TRADE
IT
I
SIMPLY
HAVE
MET
AND
TALKED
EXTENSIVELY
WITH
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
THATS
IT
THE
FBI
CAN
TAP
SOMEONE
ELSES
PHONE
MOST
PIRATING
IS
DONE
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
USE
THE
PROGRAMS
THEY
PIRATE
A
CRACKED
PROGRAM
TENDS
TO
GET
PASSED
ON
RESPLENDANT
IN
THE
VARIOUS
GRAPHICS
AND
ANIMATIONS
THAT
ADVERTISE
WHOEVER
PERFORMED
THE
MODIFICATIONS
I
ADMIT
THAT
A
LARGE
PORTION
OF
THE
BUSINESS
WORLD
IS
INVOLVED
IN
GIVING
COPIES
OF
PROGRAMS
TO
ONES
FELLOW
WORKERS
MAYBE
TAKING
IT
HOME
FOR
USE
ON
ONES
OWN
PC
BUT
SUCH
TRADING
TENDS
TO
BE
INTERDEPARTMENTAL
OR
AT
MOST
SPREAD
THROUGHOUT
THE
BUSINESS
AS
A
WHOLE
HOW
MANY
TIMES
HAVE
YOU
HAD
SOMEONE
WALKING
FROM
BUSINESS
TO
BUSINESS
LETTING
PEOPLE
COPY
DISKS
ITS
MOSTLY
A
MATTER
OF
CONVENIENCE
A
PERSON
SEES
A
PROGRAM
THEY
WANT
TO
USE
AND
THEY
FEEL
JUSTIFIED
IN
MAKING
A
COPY
SINCE
SOMEONES
ALREADY
PAID
FOR
IT
ETC
ETC
A
NOTE
THIS
IS
STARTING
TO
CHANGE
A
BIT
NOT
MUCH
THOUGH
IF
YOURE
TALKING
A
MAX
GOAL
OF
PIRATED
COPIES
I
BET
THAT
ANYTHING
THAT
WILL
BEAT
DISKCOPY
AND
CANT
BE
EASILY
COPIED
FROM
A
HARD
DRIVE
WILL
SUFFICE
WHAT
ABOUT
COMMERCIALLY
AVAILABLE
COPY
PROGRAMS
COPYII
HOW
ABOUT
PROGRAMS
LIKE
TELEDISK
THAT
CAN
DO
THINGS
DISKCOPY
CANT
AND
BEFORE
ANYONE
DISPUTES
THIS
BECAUSE
THEY
FEEL
THAT
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
COPY
WOULDNT
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
AFTER
WORKING
WITH
PEOPLE
AROUND
COMPUTERS
ONE
COMES
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THE
AVERAGE
USER
DOESNT
KNOW
MUCH
ANY
COMPUTER
ENTHUSIAST
IS
AT
LEAST
BETTER
AT
PREGUESSING
COMMANDS
AND
HOW
TO
USE
THEM
CAN
YOU
SIT
DOWN
AND
USE
SOMETHING
WITHOUT
READING
THE
MANUAL
AND
IT
IS
THESE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
DOING
THE
PIRATING
NOT
JOE
WINDOWS
USER
WHO
CANT
REMEMBER
A
FEW
ARGUMENTS
TO
THE
DIR
COMMAND
I
HATE
HARD
COPY
MANUALS
AND
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
ALL
DOCS
ONLINE
NOT
BECAUSE
I
WANT
TO
COPY
THE
PROGRAM
BUT
BECAUSE
ITS
USUALLY
FASTER
AND
AND
CONVENIENT
THAN
SIFTING
THROUGH
AN
OLD
BOOK
I
CANT
FIND
REALLY
I
FIND
IT
EVENS
OUT
THE
ONLINE
STUFF
CAN
BE
READ
THROUGH
FASTER
BUT
YOURE
STUCK
READING
IT
IN
LINEAR
FLOW
START
TO
FINISH
UNLESS
YOU
JUMP
AHEAD
WITH
A
SEARCH
OR
SUCH
A
BOOK
THOUGH
YOU
CAN
FLIP
THROUGH
FASTER
THAN
YOU
CAN
READ
TEXT
ON
A
SCREEN
AND
THEY
USUALLY
HAVE
A
NIFTY
INDEX
TOO
BUT
I
PARTIALLY
AGREE
I
OFTEN
WISH
I
COULD
GREP
SOMETHING
THAT
WAS
WRITTEN
DOWN
OFF
DEEPER
END
WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
THINK
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
A
BACKUP
COPY
ALMOST
ALL
NEW
SOFTWARE
MUST
BE
INSTALLED
TO
THE
HARD
DISK
SO
YOU
ARE
LEFT
WITH
THE
ORIGINALS
AS
YOUR
BACKUPS
I
THINK
ITS
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
SPACE
AND
MONEY
AS
WELL
AS
IT
MAKES
IT
TO
TEMPTING
TO
LEND
OUT
THE
BACKUPS
WHAT
IF
THEY
NEED
TO
REINSTALL
THE
IDEA
OF
A
BACKUP
STILL
HOLDS
IF
THE
ORIGINAL
DISK
GOES
BAD
THEYRE
OUT
OF
LUCK
FOR
ABOUT
WEEKS
WHICH
IS
THE
USUAL
TURN
AROUND
TIME
FOR
A
COMPANY
TO
SEND
A
NEW
SET
OF
DISKS
IF
THEYLL
DO
IT
WITHOUT
A
CHARGE
