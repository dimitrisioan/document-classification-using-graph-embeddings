re
as
moisture
repellant
was
lead
acid
batteries
c
i
was
a
bit
surprised
that
the
manual
for
my
multimeter
suggests
applying
to
the
test
lead
sockets
especially
the
current
range
socket
the
intention
is
to
prevent
the
testleadisinthewrongscocket
beeper
from
going
off
when
there
is
no
test
lead
in
that
socket
the
manual
is
a
bit
vague
but
i
think
id
apply
the
to
a
swab
then
wipe
the
socket
instead
of
spaying
the
stuff
directly
from
the
can
speaking
of
said
meters
i
compared
the
against
the
that
ive
had
on
my
bench
for
almost
years
it
has
been
five
years
since
the
has
been
calibrated
on
the
dc
scale
they
agree
within
mv
ac
scale
is
within
about
mv
the
would
be
just
about
the
perfect
portable
meter
if
it
had
the
db
scale
i
didnt
feel
it
was
worth
the
extra
for
a
second
since
i
dont
use
db
all
that
much
in
my
work
