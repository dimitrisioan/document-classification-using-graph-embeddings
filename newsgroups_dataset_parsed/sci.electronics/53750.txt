built
a
little
project
using
the
radio
shack
relays
to
switch
audio
i
got
pretty
bad
clicks
when
the
thing
switched
i
was
doing
most
of
the
common
things
one
is
supposed
to
do
when
using
relays
and
nothing
seemed
to
get
rid
of
the
clicks
my
question
is
is
there
a
good
relayrelay
circuit
that
i
can
use
for
switching
audio
so
that
there
will
be
no
noise
of
any
kind
on
the
audio
lines
i
will
appreciate
any
advice
or
references
to
advice

names
etc
for
the
relays
