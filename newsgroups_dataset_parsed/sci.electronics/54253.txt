IF
YOU
READ
MY
WHOLE
SUGGESTION
IM
SAYING
THAT
YOU
REGISTER
VIA

MAILING
IN
YOUR
REGISTRATION
CARD
THEN
THE
COMPANY
SEND
YOU
THE
PATCH

THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
SCHEME
IS
THAT
WHEN
I

I
WANT
TO
PLAY
IT
THAT
DAYMAILING

PROBABLY

DIDNT
SAY
THE

TAKE
MY
WORDS
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
I

THAT
ONCE
YOU
HAVE
INSTALLED
IT
YOU
CANNOT
DEINSTALL
IT
WITHOUT
REGISTERING
IT
OR
TRANSFER
IT
TO
ANOTHER
MACHINE
OR
SOME
SORT
OF
