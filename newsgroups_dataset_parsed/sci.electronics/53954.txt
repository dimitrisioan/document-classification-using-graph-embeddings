i
have
notice
a
lot
of
electronics
questions
by
people
who
are
obviously
not
tunedin
to
electronics
many
of
them
have
rather
simple
answers
and
many
of
them
require
a
circuit
diagram
rather
than
muck
up
the
network
why
dont
you
write
to
me
send
a
self
addressed
stamped
envelop
and
ill
answer
your
questions
