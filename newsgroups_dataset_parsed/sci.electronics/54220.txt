MICHAEL
LEVIN
WRITES
I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
LITTLE
GIZMO
THAT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
INSTALLED
IN
SERIES
WITH
THE
TIP
OR
RING
LINES
OF
THE
PHONE
WIRE
WHICH
ONES
ARE
THOSE
SUPPOSE
I
AM
HOLDING
A
REGULAR
PHONE
WIRE
SUCH
THAT
THE
LITTLE
PLASTIC
TOOTH
ON
THE
LITTLE
PLASTIC
SQUARE
THING
WITH
THE
NAKED
LEAD
ENDS
THAT
YOU
PLUG
INTO
THE
PHONE
IS
FACING
DOWN
AND
AWAY
FROM
ME
WHICH
OF
THE
WIRES
THAT
I
SEE
IS
THE
TIP
AND
WHICH
IS
THE
RING
PLEASE
REPLY
TO
MIKE
LEVIN
MIKE
RING
IS
THE
RED
WIRE
TIP
IS
THE
GREEN
WIRE
OF
MOST
STANDARD
PHONE
LINES
THEY
TWO
CONSTITUTE
THE
TWO
WIRES
MOST
OFTEN
USED
FOR
VOICE
TELEPHONE
THE
TWO
LIVE
LINES
THEY
ARE
THE
TWO
INNERMOST
CONNECTORS
OF
AN
PHONE
JACK
ANOTHER
WAY
OF
TELLING
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
MEASURE
VOLTAGE
FROM
RED
TO
GREEN
RING
TO
TIP
TIPGREEN
BEING
AT
GROUND
POTENTIAL
OF
THE
VOLTMETER
IT
SHOULD
READ
VOLTS
IN
THE
ONHOOK
NORING
POSITION
I
AM
SURE
ITS
V
AND
NOT
VOLTS
DOESNT
HURT
A
PHONE
TOO
MUCH
IF
THEYRE
REVERSED
ITS
JUST
BAD
IF
ONE
HAPPENS
TO
SOMEHOW
GET
GROUNDED
TO
EARTH
GROUND
ELSEWHERE
ADDITIONALLY
WHEN
OFFHOOK
THE
VOLTAGE
DROPS
TO
ABOUT
TO
VOLTS
DC
I
THINK
IT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
CORRESPOND
TO
A
TO
MA
CURRENT
LOOP
AND
LASTLY
WHEN
RINGING
THE
TWO
WIRES
DEVELOP
AN
AC
POTENTIAL
OF
ABOUT
V
PP
AT
TO
HZ
ACROSS
THEM
WHERE
YOU
GET
THE
ELECTROMECHANICAL
OLD
FASHIONED
BELL
