WRITES
WRONG
IT
HAS
A
FOR
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
THE
WAS
A
WITHOUT
IRQ
OR
NMI
AND
WITH
ONLY
ADDRESS
LINES
GIVING
MEMORY
SPACE
YES
BUT
STILL
NOT
A
FOR
THOSE
DIFFERENCES
SAME
INSTRUCTION
SET
OF
COURSE
IT
HAD
ONE
CUSTOM
CHIP
NOT
AN
ASIC
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
WORD
IS
NOW
UNDERSTOOD
THE
TIA
SOMETIMES
KNOWN
AS
THE
ALTHOUGH
MOST
OTHER
MANUFACTURERS
LIST
THAT
AS
THE
CIA
COMPLEX
INTERFACE
ADAPTER
TIA
STANDS
FOR
TELEVISION
INTERFACE
ADAPTER
AND
IT
HANDLES
SOUND
PADDLES
AND
THE
MINIMAL
VIDEO
HARDWARE
THE
POSSESSED
DIDNT
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
BEING
CALLED
THE
THATS
THE
CIA
FOUND
IN
THE
COMMODORE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THIS
CHIP
EXISTED
WHEN
THE
WAS
AROUND
YES
THE
SAME
NUMBER
BUT
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
DEVICE
I
SHOULD
HAVE
QUALIFIED
THIS
FURTHER
BY
STATING
THAT
THIS
WAS
THE
PAL
VERSION
OF
THE
TIA
I
AM
NOT
SURE
THAT
THE
NTSC
TIA
WOULD
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
NUMBER
THE
TIA
WAS
MAPPED
INTO
THE
BOTTOM
BYTES
OF
PAGE
AND
SHADOWED
IN
THE
BOTTOM
BYTES
OF
PAGE
TO
GET
AN
IMAGE
ON
THE
SCREEN
YOU
HAD
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
THE
RASTER
LINE
YOUR
PICTURE
STARTED
AT
LOAD
BITMAPS
FOR
THIS
LINE
INTO
THE
SPRITE
REGISTERS
TELL
THEM
WHAT
X
POSITIONS
TO
TAKE
HOW
MANY
DUPLICATES
YOU
WANTED
ETC
THEN
DO
IT
ALL
AGAIN
FOR
THE
NEXT
LINE
THIS
TOOK
ALL
OF
THE
PROCESSORS
TIME
DURING
THE
VISIBLE
PORTION
OF
THE
DISPLAY
DOES
ANYONE
ON
THE
NET
ACTUALLY
HAVE
DETAILS
OF
THE
TIA
AS
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
DEVICE
I
HAVE
NOT
YET
DISCOVERED
DETAILS
ABOUT
ATARI
AUSTRALIA
WHEN
ASKED
CLAIMED
THAT
THEIR
ATTEMPTS
TO
GET
THE
PROGRAMMERS
DOCUMENTATION
FOR
THE
HAD
FAILED
AS
THE
US
HEAD
OFFICE
HAD
REFUSED
TO
PROVIDE
IT
TO
CHIP
SELECTS
THE
LIKES
TO
HAVE
ROM
RIGHT
AT
THE
TOP
OF
MEMORY
SO
THE
HAD
TO
USE
ROMS
WITH
ACTIVE
HIGH
CHIP
SELECTS
NOT
EXACTLY
NORMAL
SO
SOME
CARTRIGES
HAD
A
IN
THEM
TO
CONVERT
THIS
TO
THE
MORE
USUAL
ACTIVE
LOW
CHIP
SELECT
I
SAW
A
COUPLE
OF
CHEAPER
DEVICES
WITH
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
RESISTORS
HOOKED
UP
AS
A
CHEAP
INVERTER
NASTY
BUT
WORKABLE
AND
CHEAPER
THAN
A
INVERTER
IF
LABOR
COSTS
ALMOST
NOTHING
