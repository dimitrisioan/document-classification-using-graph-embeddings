i
was
wondering
if
people
had
any
good
uses
for
old
simms
i
have
a
bunch
of
them
for
the
apple
mac
and
i
know
lots
of
other
people
do
to
i
have
tried
to
sell
them
but
have
gotten
no
interest
so
if
you
have
an
inovative
use
or
want
to
buy
some
simms
sure
ill
give
you
bucks
for
all
of
them
i
think
they
are
really
neat
to
put
onto
key
rings
when
somebody
makes
the
mistake
of
asking
about
it
you
can
totally
geek
out
tc
