I
AM
TRYING
TO
BUILD
A
SYNCHRONOUS
DEMODULATOR
AND
IVE
HIT
A
SNAG
IN
MY
APPLICATION
I
WANT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
CHANGE
THE
GAIN
OF
AN
OP
AMP
AMPLIFIER
FROM
TO
CONTROLABLE
VIA
A
DIGITAL
INPUT
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
WAY
IVE
COME
UP
WITH
IS
TO
USE
ANALOG
SWITCHES
TO
ADJUST
THE
GAIN
OF
THE
OP
AMP
THE
ONLY
ANALOG
SWITCH
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
IT
THE
UNFORTUNATELY
I
WANT
TO
SWITCH
AN
AC
SIGNAL
WHICH
GOES
FROM
ABOUT
TO
AND
THE
IS
ONLY
FOR
POSITIVE
SIGNALS
I
HAVE
RECENTLY
USED
THE
TO
SWITCH
A
BIPOLAR
SIGNAL
I
SIMPLY
RAN
THE
OFF
A
BIPOLAR
SUPPLY
IN
THIS
CASE
AS
LONG
AS
YOUR
ANALOG
INPUT
SIGNAL
STAYS
BETWEEN
THE
SUPPLY
RAILS
THE
WILL
WORK
FINE
OF
COURSE
YOUR
CONTROL
LOGIC
INPUT
MUST
USE
AS
THE
LOGIC
LOW
AND
AS
THE
LOGIC
HIGH
REFERENCE
SO
THAT
EITHER
ALL
YOUR
DRIVING
LOGIC
MUST
BE
CMOS
WITH
THE
SAME
BIPOLAR
SUPPLY
OR
YOU
MUST
PROVIDE
SOME
KIND
OF
VOLTAGE
LEVEL
SHIFTING
CIRCUIT
BETWEEN
THE
AND
THE
CONTROL
LOGIC
IN
MY
CASE
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
USE
THE
BIPOLAR
SUPPLY
ALL
THE
WAY
