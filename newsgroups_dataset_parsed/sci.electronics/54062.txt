why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
i
decided
to
bring
the
battery
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycle
from
the
unheated
garage
this
year
to
preserve
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
noticed
that
not
only
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
terminals
are
shorted
i
asked
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
cause
it
ruins
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
why
this
topic
was
beaten
to
death
a
year
or
so
ago
the
concrete
is
not
the
problem
leadacid
batteries
often
fail
from
disuse
not
being
charged
for
a
long
time
but
theres
no
way
the
concrete
floor
could
be
the
cause
of
the
problem
