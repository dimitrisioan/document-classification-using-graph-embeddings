message
flashing
on
tv
hi
i
was
doing
research
on
subliminal
suggestion
for
a
psychology
paper
and
i
read
that
one
researcher
flashed
hidden
messages
on
the
tv
screen
at
of
a
second

that
possible
i
thought
the
maximum
rate
the
tv
was
even
capable
of
displaying
images
was
of
a
second
or
of
a

for
an
image
composed
