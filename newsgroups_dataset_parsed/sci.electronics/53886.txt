PETER
THE
ATARI
USED
A
CPU
JUST
LIKE
THEIR
ENTIRE
LINE
COMPUTERS
AS
WELL
AS
THE
GAME
MACHINE
THE
HAD
SOME
EXTRA
ASIC
CHIPS
THAT
WERE
BASICALLY
MODIFIED
GRAPHICS
CHIPS
AND
PIAS
FOR
THE
JOYSTICKS
LATER
MODEL
MIGHT
HAVE
INCORPORATED
MANY
OF
THE
CHIPS
INTO
ONE
ASCI
AS
THE
WEIGHT
OF
THE
MACHINES
AND
PART
COUNT
DECREASED
A
LOT
OVER
THE
YEARS
ADDITIONALLY
I
THINK
THE
USED
AND
UP
TO
OF
ROM
FOR
THEIR
GAMES
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
MUCH
RAM
IT
HAD
TO
WORK
WITH
BUT
I
WOULD
HAZARD
A
GUESS
OF
OR
RAM
THINK
COMES
FROM
A
LOT
OF
HACKING
WITH
THE
AND
COMPUTERS
AND
OCCASIONALLY
HACKING
WITH
THE
FIXING
IT
FOR
MONITOR
COMPOSITE
VIDEO
USE
AND
AUDIO
HOOKUPS
ALSO
I
TRYED
TO
MAKE
A
CARTRIDGELESS
SYSTEM
THAT
STORED
THE
ROM
INTO
A
RAM
CARTRIDGE
THAT
COULD
BE
LOADED
UP
AT
SOME
PRIOR
TIME
A
WAY
TO
BACKUP
CARTRIDGES
IVE
HEARD
OF
A
SETUP
LIKE
THIS
WHERE
GAMES
COULD
BE
BOUGHT
CHEAPLY
ON
FSKRECORDED
TAPES
THEN
YOU
WOULD
LOAD
THEM
INTO
A
SPECIAL
RAM
CARTIDGE
AND
PLAY
THEM
ANYWAYS
IF
YOURE
INTERESTED
IN
LOOKING
FOR
EQUIPMENT
WEVE
GOT
TWO
MACHINES
AROUND
ONE
COMPOSITE
AV
MODIFIED
AND
LOTSA
CARTRIDGES
WILLING
TO
SELL
FOR
REASONABLE
OFFER
SHIPPING
AND
HANDLING
DONT
PLAY
IT
ANYMORE
SINCE
GOING
TO
COMPUTERS
NINTENDO
INTERESTED
IN
THAT
TOO
HOPE
THAT
HELPS
YOUR
QUESTION
I
MIGHT
GRAB
SOME
OUT
TOO
SINCE
THEY
MUST
BE
FUN
TO
PLAY
WITH
