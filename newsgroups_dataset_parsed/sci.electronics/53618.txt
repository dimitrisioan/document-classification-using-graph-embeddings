YOU
ARE
EXPERIENCING
WHAT
IS
CALLED
MACROVISION
IT
IS
THE
PROTECTION
THAT
THEY
USE
ON
THE
VIDEO
TAPES
THERE
ARE
TWO
WAYS
AROUND
THIS
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
FIRST
OF
ALL
YOU
CAN
TRY
USING
A
DIFFERENT
VCR
TO
COPY
ONTO
IT
IS
THE
INPUT
OF
THE
VCR
THAT
REACTS
TO
THE
PROTECTION
SO
SOMETIMES
JUST
SWITCHING
THE
TWO
VCRS
AROUND
WILL
TAKE
CARE
OF
IT
SOME
MODELS
JUST
DONT
REACT
TO
IT
DOES
THIS
ALSO
AFFECT
THE
VIEWING
OF
TAPES
I
HAVE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
RENTED
TAPES
THEY
WERE
VIRTUALLY
UNVIEWABLE
I
FIDDLED
WITH
THE
TUNING
TRACKING
AND
VERTICAL
HOLD
BUT
IT
WAS
NO
GOOD
