there
are
two
simple
procedures
for
alterating
any
odometer
mechanical
driven
odometer
remove
the
speedo
cable
from
the
transmission
attach
a
drill
and
run
at
max
speed
until
the
speedo
turns
over
continue
until
the
desired
mileage
is
reached
electronically
driven
odometer
remove
the
sensor
wire
from
the

attach
the
calibration
out

an

dear
faster
i
kinda
wonder
have
you
ever
tried
version
on
what
since
the
sensor
wire
on
a
bmw
feeds
also
into
the
computer
and
we
dont
know
what
signal
voltage
is
expected
from
it
bad
things
could
happen
also
since
we
dont
know
the
pulse
rate
we
may
damage
the
analog
part
of
the
speedo
yes
bmw
uses
a
combined
instrument
speed
in
analog
trip
and
total
milage
is
digital
with
the
needle
pegged
up
against
the
stop
just
a
thought
youve
got
the
oscilliscope
so
you
connect
it
up
to
the
sensor
wire
and
measure
this
stuff
that
way
you
know
what
it
expects
