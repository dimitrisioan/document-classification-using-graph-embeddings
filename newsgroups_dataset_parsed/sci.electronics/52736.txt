THE
PADSZIP
FILES
CONTAIN
SUBDIRECTORIES

HAVE
TO
BE
UNZIPPED
VIA

THEN
AN
XCOPY
S
TO
THREE
FLOPPIES
CREATES
THE
DISKS
NEEDED
TO
DO
THE
INSTALL
IM
STILL
NOT
SURE
HOW
THIS
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
WORK
SINCE
THE
ZIP
FILES
TOOK
UP
ABOUT
SO
IT
MUST
BE
A
TIGHT
SQUEEZE
ON
THOSE
FLOPPIES
HOWEVER
I
MANAGED
TO
INSTALL
PADS
AND
IM
PRETTY
IMPRESSED
I
CREATED
A
COUPLE
OF
SCHEMATICS
WITHOUT
PROBLEM
BUT
WHENEVER
I
TRY
TO
CREATE
A
PCB
LAYOUT

MY
CIRCUITS
RATHER
THAN
THE
DEMOS
IT
DOESNT
WORK
IM
WONDERING
IF
MAYBE
A
FILE
ISNT
WHERE
IT
SHOULD
BE
CAN
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
A
PRINTED
MANUAL
COMMENT
ON
WHETHER
THE
REGISTRATION
FEE
IS
WORTH
