i
recall
reading
of
a
phonograph
which
used
mechanical
amplification
compressed
air
was
squirted
out
of
a
valve
which
was
controlled
by
the
pickup
the
result
was
noisy
and
distinctly
lofi
but
much
louder
nasa
and
related
agencies
apparently
used
this
same
principles
to
create
the
loudest
reported
reproduced
sound
they
used
an
analog
electrically
controlled
valve
to
control
the
flow
of
air
across
a
horn
throat
if
i
remember
correctly
it
was
called
a
modulated
air
blast
transducer
there
were
reports
of
the
thing
being
able
to
produce

communicate
directly
with
