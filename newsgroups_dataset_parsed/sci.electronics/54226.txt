im
wondering
if
i
can
tote
my
american
touch
tone
phone
around
with
me
to
sweden
and
germany
its
dc
powered
and
i
can
buy
a
special
adapter
for
that
in
europe
the
question
is
if
the
general
electronics
work
the
same
i
can
buy
a
different
wall
plug
and
refit
it
im
sure
id
have
to
but
would
that
do
the
trick
two
things
to
watch
for
in
germany
and
i
think
the
same
holds
for
sweden
only
some
of
the
connections
can
handle
tone
dialing
so
make
sure
the
phone
can
be
set
to
pulse
dialing
most
if
not
virtually
all
swedish
exchanges
can
handle
tone
dialling
many
older
electromechanical
exchanges
have
been
modified
accept
tone
dialling
