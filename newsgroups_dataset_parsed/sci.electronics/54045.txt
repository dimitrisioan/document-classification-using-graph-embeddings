RE
LEAD
ACID
BATTERIES
CONCRETE
IN
ARTICLE
CARTER
AMES
WRITES
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
ONE
THING
ACTUALLY
TWO
I
HOPE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
PROPER
PLACE
TO
POST
THIS
SUBJECT
WHY
DOES
A
LEAD
ACID
BATTERY
DISCHARGE
AND
BECOME
DEAD
TOTALLY
UNUSEABLE
WHEN
STORED
ON
A
CONCRETE
FLOOR
I
DECIDED
TO
BRING
THE
BATTERY
IN
FROM
THE
LAWN
MOWER
AND
THE
MOTORCYCLE
FROM
THE
UNHEATED
GARAGE
THIS
YEAR
TO
PRESERVE
THEM
AND
I
JUST
WENT
TO
USE
THEM
AND
NOTICED
THAT
NOT
ONLY
DO
THEY
NOT
WORK
BUT
THEY
ACT
LIKE
THE
TWO
TERMINALS
ARE
SHORTED
I
ASKED
A
FRIEND
AND
HE
SAID
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
NEVER
DO
THAT
CAUSE
IT
RUINS
THEM
BUT
HE
COULDNT
TELL
ME
WHY
THANKS
I
AM
NOT
A
BATTERY
EXPERT
BUT
FROM
RECENT
READING
A
LEAD
ACID
BATTERY
WILL
SELF
DISCHARGE
AT
A
RELATIVELY
HIGH
RATE
AND
IF
STORED
IN
A
DISCHARGED
STATE
WILL
DEVELOP
A
CONDITION
I
THINK
IS
CALLED
SULFATION
IN
STORAGE
EITHER
THE
ELECTROLYTE
SHOULD
BE
REMOVED
AND
REPLACED
FOR
USE
FAT
CHANCE
ID
EVER
DO
THAT
AT
HOME
OR
THE
BATTERY
SHOULD
BE
STORED
ON
A
TRICKLE
CHARGE
I
HAVE
ALSO
I
THINK
READ
THAT
THE
CONDITION
MAY
BE
REVERSABLE
IF
HOOKED
UP
TO
A
CURRENT
LIMITED
CHARGING
CIRCUIT
FRO
A
LONG
PERIOD
OF
TIME
THE
REFERNCE
I
REMEMBER
IS
TO
USE
WHERE
C
IS
THE
AMP
HOURS
AS
THE
CHARGING
CIRCUIT
AND
LEAVE
IT
HOOKED
UP
FOR
WEEKS
SOME
OF
THIS
MAY
ONLY
APPLY
TO
GEL
TYPE
CELLS
BUT
I
SUSPECT
THE
SAME
APPLIES
TO
THE
LIQUID
TYPE
