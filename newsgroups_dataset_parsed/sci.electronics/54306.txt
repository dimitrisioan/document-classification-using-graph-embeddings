I
WROTE
BIT
OF
IT
YOU
COULD
TAKE
THE
TAPE
OVER
TO
A
LOCAL
HAM
OPERATORS
HOUSE
AND
ASK
HIM
FOR
HIS
OPINION
OF
WHAT
YOURE
HEARING
MOST
COMMUNITIES
YOU
CANNOT
DO
THAT
LEGALLY
HOWEVER
YOU
CAN
ASK
A
HAM
OVER
TO
LISTEN
IF
THE
INTERFERENCE
OCCURS
AT
A
SPECIFIC
TIME
EACH
DAY
THEN
IT
WOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
SUCH
SCHEDULING
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
YOU
COULD
INVITE
THE
HAM
OVER
TO
TRANSMIT
FROM
YOUR
DRIVEWAY
TO
SEE
IF
HE
INTERFERES
IF
HE
DOES
THEN
YOU
PROBABLY
NEED
TO
HAVE
YOUR
EQUIPMENT
WORKED
ON
TO
MAKE
IT
IMMUNE
TO
RF
INTERFERENCE
AS
A
COUPLD
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
POINTED
OUT
THIS
IS
WRONG
IT
IS
NOT
ILLEGAL
TO
RECORD
OR
DISCLOSE
WHAT
YOU
HEARD
ON
