THERE
IS
OR
WAS
A
MICROWAVE
TOWER
NEXT
TO
FLORIDAS
TURNPIKE
AND
YOU
COULD
WATCH
THE
CARS
HIT
THE
BREAKS
AS
THEY
CAME
IN
SIGHT
OF
IT
EVERY
MORNING
FUNNY
I
AND
MOST
OF
THE
DETECTOROWNING
FRIENDS
I
HAVE
ARE
GENERALLY
ABLE
TO
REMEMBER
SUCH
THINGS
AS
NEARBY
MICROWAVE
TOWERS
AND
RADAR
DETECTORS
GOING
OFF
IN
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
SPON
EVERY
DAY
I
KNOW
ON
AT
THE
GRAYSON
KY
EXIT
THERES
A
STORE
JUST
OFF
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
THINK
ITS
A
LIQUOR

FEDERAL
PRISONS

EVER
DRIVEN
BY
BESIDES
A
COP

PUTS
MY
WHISTLER

GOD

RIGHT
BEHIND
YOU

I
SIMPLY
IGNORE
THE
DETECTOR
AND
USE
MY
EYES
WHEN
I
DRIVE
BY
THAT
STORE
SECONDS
LATER
ALLS
QUIET
ON
THE
FRONT
