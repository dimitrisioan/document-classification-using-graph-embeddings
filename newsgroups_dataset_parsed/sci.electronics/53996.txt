NEIL
B
GANDLER
WRITES
HOW
DOES
THE
RADIO

FREE
INFORMATION
CARDS
WORK
DO
THEY
JUST
SEND
YOU
SOME
GENERAL
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
COMPANIES
THAT
ADVERTISE
IN
THEIR
MAGAZINE
OR
DOES
IT
ALSO
GIVE
YOU
SIGN
YOU
UP
FOR
A
CATALOG
THAT
DEPENDS
ENTIRELY
UPON
THE
ADVERTISER
WHOSE
NUMBER
YOU
CIRCLED
RADIO
ELECTRONICS
COMPILES
ALL
OF
THE
CARDS
THEN
EACH
ADVERTISER
GETS
A
COMPUTER
PRINTOUT
OF
THE
NAMES
AND
ADDRESSES
OF
ALL
OF
THE
READERS
WHO
CIRCLED
THEIR
NUMBER
SOME
MAGAZINES
ALSO
PROVIDE
THE
DATA
ON
SELFADHESIVE
LABELS
AND
THE
REALLY

PROVIDE
THE

DISK
THE

DECIDES
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH

INFORMATION
CARD
COMMONLY
CALLED
A
BINGO
CARD
IN
THE
INDUSTRY
INCLUDES
LINES
FOR
A
COMPANY
NAME
AND
A
BUSINESS
PHONE
NUMBER
MY
GUESS
WOULD
BE
THAT
THE
BIG
NATIONAL
ADVERTISERS
MAKE
A
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
HOBBIESTS
AND
PROFESSIONALS
AS
BEST
THEY
CAN
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
YOU
INCLUDE
MOTOROLA
AS
YOUR
COMPANY
AND
INCLUDE
A
BUSINESS
PHONE
AND
A
MAIL
STOP
TEKTRONICS
WILL
PROBABLY
SEND
YOU
A
COPY
OF
THEIR
HARDBOUND
CATALOG
AND
HAVE
A
SALES
ENGINEER
CALL
YOU
ABOUT
A
WEEK
LATER
IF
YOU
LEAVE
IT
BLANK
ODDS
ARE
THEY
WILL
SEND
YOU
A
SLICK
BROCHURE
AND
DIRECT
YOU
TO
A
LOCAL
RETAIL
OUTLET
MEDIUM
AND
SMALL
COMPANIES
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
SEND
YOU
TH
E
WHOLE
CATALOG
AND
THEN
SOME
COMPANIES
LIKE
DIGIKEY
OR
JAMECO
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
MAIL
OUT
ACCEPT
THE
CATALOG
A
COUPLE
OF
OTHER
INTERESTING
POINTS
ABOUT
BINGO
CARDS
FREE
INDUSTRY
MAGAZINES
LIKE
EDN
AND
SUCH
ALSO
LOG
YOUR
CARD
TO
THEIR
COMPUTER
THEY
USE
THE
INFORMATION
AT
LEAST
THREE
WAYS
THEY
NOTE
THAT
YOU
REALLY
DO
READ
THE
MAGAZINE
AND
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
CONTINUE
YOUR
SUBSCRIPTION
OR
PUSH
YOU
THROUGH
REPEATED
MAILINGS
TO
RESUBSCRIBE
THEY
ALSO
COMPILE
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
REQUESTED
WHICH
DATA
FOR
THEIR
MARKETING
DEMOGRAPHICS
THIS
WAY
THAY
CAN
TELL
A
PROSPECTIVE
ADVERTISER
THAT
OF
READERS
REQUESTING
DATA
WERE
INTERESTED
IN
CAPACITORS
AND
FINALLY
SOME
MAGAZINES
RENT
LISTS
OF
READERS
WHO
REQUEST
CERTAIN
INFORMATION
FOR
EXAMPLE
TEKTRONICS
CAN
RENT
A
LIST
OF
EVERYONE
WHO
REQUESTED

ABOUT
TEST
EQUIPMENT
OTHER
THAN
TEKTRONICS
IN
THE
PAST
MONTHS
THE
OTHER
POINT
IN

THE
ADVERTISER
RECEIVES
MANY
MAGAZINES
INCLUDE
HOW
MANY
ITEMS
YOU
CIRCLED
ON

IF
THEY
WANT
THE

CAN
ATTEMPT
TO
CULL

COLLECTORS
FROM
THE
SERIOUS
POTENTIAL
CUSTOMERS
CAN
YOU
SAY
QUALIFIED
SALES
LEADS
I
THOUGHT
YOU
COULD
WHATS
THE
BEST
WAY
FOR
A
HOBBIEST
TO
DEAL
WITH
BINGO
CARDS
NEVER
CIRCLE
MORE
THAN
NUMBER
ON
THE
CARD
IF
YOU
WANT
MORE
THAN
ITEMS
USE
THE
SECOND
CARD
AND
MAIL

A
COUPLE
OF

LATER
IF

ALSO
CUT
ABOUT
DAYS
OFF

THE
RESPONSE
TIME
VIRTUALLY
EVERYONE
TAKES
