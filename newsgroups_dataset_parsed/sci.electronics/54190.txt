RE
AS
MOISTURE
REPELLANT
WAS
LEAD
ACID
BATTERIES
C
FROM
MATGBBLURELATROBEEDUAU
BYRNESGRAHAM
IN
SASRERUNXSASCOM
WRITES
SERVICES
WE
OFFERED
WAS
AN
ENGINE
CLEANING
REMOVE
ALL
THAT
OIL
BEFORE
YOU
SELL
THE
CAR
UNFORTUNATELY
WE
DID
NOT
HAVE
A
HIGH
PRESSURE
WASHER
SO
WE
WOULD
USE
ONE
SEVERAL
MILES
FROM
THE
SHOP
ON
MORE
THAN
ONE
OCCASION
AFTER
WASHING
THE
ENGINE
IT
WOULD
NOT
START
AS
WATER
WOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
UNDER
THE
DISTRIBUTOR
I
WOULD
PUT
A
PLASTIC
BAG
AROUND
IT
TO
TRY
AND
MINIMIZE
THIS
AROUND
THE
SPARK
PLUG
WIRES
ETC
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TRY
AND
WIPE
ALL
THESE
AREAS
DOWN
WITH
A
DRY
RAG
THE
USUAL
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
CARRY
A
CAN
OF
AND
WHEN
THE
CAR
WOULDNT
START
TO
SPRAY
ALL
THE
LIKELY
AREAS
AND
IT
WOULD
THEN
START
ON
THE
VERY
FIRST
TIME
THIS
DEFINATELY
GETS
THE
CAR
GOING
BUT
IS
HIGHLY
FLAMMABLE
EXPLOSIVE
EVEN
IN
THE
RIGHT
CONDITIONS
LIKE
A
VAPOUR
SEALED
INSIDE
A
DISTRIBUTOR
FOR
EG
AND
CONTACT
POINTS
TEND
TO
ARC
A
TINY
BIT
I
ONCE
SAW
THE
ALTERNATORPOINTS
COVER
BLOW
COMPLETELY
OFF
A
MOTORCYCLE
AFTER
IT
HAD
BEEN
RESTORED
TO
LIFE
WITH
FUN
TO
WATCH
IT
WAS
A
HONDA
MINIBIKE
AND
THE
COVER
IS
ONLY
HELD
ON
BY
LARGE
RUBBER
GROMMET
SO
IT
WASNT
REALLY
A
BIG
BLAST
GRAHAM
B
PS
AS
A
MORE
SERIOUS
ASIDE
IT
IS
APPARENTLY
ALSO
CONDUCTIVE
SO
IT
IS
BEST
TO
EXERCISE
CAUTION
WITH
IT
AROUND
MAINS
WIRING
