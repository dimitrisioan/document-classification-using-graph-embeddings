HI
I
WAS
DOING
RESEARCH
ON
SUBLIMINAL
SUGGESTION
FOR
A
PSYCHOLOGY
PAPER
AND
I
READ
THAT
ONE
RESEARCHER
FLASHED
HIDDEN
MESSAGES
ON
THE
TV
SCREEN
AT
OF
A
SECOND
IS
THAT
POSSIBLE
MIGHT
EVEN
BE

BACK
IN
HIGH
SCHOOL
I
WORKED
AS
A
LAB
ASSISTANT
FOR
A
BUNCH
OF
EXPERIMENTAL
PSYCHOLOGISTS
AT
BELL
LABS
WHEN
THEY
WERE
DOING
VISUAL
PERCEPTION
AND

EXPERIMENTS
THEY
USED
VECTORTYPE
DISPLAYS
WITH
REFRESH
RATES
COMMON
SO
YOUR
CASE
OF
SEC
IS
QUITE
PRACTICAL
AND
THE
EXPERIMENTERS
WERE
PROBABLY
SURE
THAT
IT
WAS
