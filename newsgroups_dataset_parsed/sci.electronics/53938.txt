BE
EMITTING
A
SIGNATURE
IM
LEANING
TOWARD
KHZ
SQUARE

CYCLE
I
AM
CONSIDERING
THE
USE
OF
A
QUADRANT
DETECTOR
FROM

INC
TO
GIVE

TO
A
PANTILT
HEAD
TO
POINT
THE
SENSOR
AND
THUS
DETERMINE
THE
ANGLES
FOR
THE

I
AM
CONSIDERING
WAZING
THE
HECK
OUT
OF
AN
IR

POSSIBLY
AN
OPTEK
OR
MOTOROLA
WAZING
WOULD
MEAN
AT
LEAST
AMP
CURRENT
PULSES
AT
THIS
CURRENT
THE
DUTY

PULSES
IF
YOU

A
BIT
IT
WILL
OUTPUT
NEARLY
A
WATT
MW
WITH
REAL
SHORT
DUTY
CYCLE
TIMES
NICE
THING
ABOUT
THE
IS
THAT
IT
IS
CHEAP
I
GOT
MINE
