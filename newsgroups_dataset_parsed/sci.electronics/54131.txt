WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
THINK
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
A
BACKUP
COPY
ALMOST
ALL
NEW
SOFTWARE
MUST
BE
INSTALLED
TO
THE
HARD
DISK
SO
YOU
ARE
LEFT
WITH
THE
ORIGINALS
AS
YOUR
BACKUPS
I
THINK
ITS
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
SPACE
AND
MONEY
AS
WELL
AS
IT
MAKES
IT
TO
TEMPTING
TO
LEND
OUT
THE
BACKUPS
MY
OWN
PRACTICE
WITH
NEW
SOFTWARE
MAKE
A
COPY
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
FLOPPIES
TO
A
SECOND
SET
OF

SOMETIMES
SOFTWARE
GOES
OUT
ON

THAT
ARE
JUST
MARGINALLY
GOOD
OR
GETS
TOO
CLOSE
TO
A
MAGNET
IN
SHIPPING
OR

IVE
HAD
EXPERIENCE
WITH
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
LAST
I
PURCHASED
A
COMPILER
FROM
A
REPUTABLE
VENDOR
THE
DEBUGGER
IN
THE

JUST
WOULD
NOT

NO

FINALLY
GOT
A
CLEAN
READ
OF
THE

I
DONT
RECALL
IF
I
USED
DISKCOPY
COPYB
OR
XCOPY
I
MADE
A
SECOND
COPY
OF
THE
MARGINAL
FLOPPY
AND
INSTALLED
FROM
THAT
NO
PROBLENMS
EXCEPT
WITH
MY
TYPING
SINCE
I
REGARD
BACKUP
FLOPPIES
AS
CHEAP
INSURANCE

MY
SIDE
