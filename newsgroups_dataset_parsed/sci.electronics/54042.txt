RE
HOW
TO
THE
DISKS
COPY
PROTECTED
HEY
NOW
WILL
YOU
STOP
ENCOURAGING
HIM
COPY
PROTECTION
ONLY
SERVES
ONE
PUR
POSE
TO
KEEP
THE
HONEST
BUYER
FROM
MAKING
LEGAL
BACKUP
COPIES
IT
WILL
DEFINITELY
NOT
STOP
ANY
PIRATES
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
PROTECT
YOU
SOFT
SUPPLY
A
GOOD
DOCUMENTATION
AND
SUPPORT
THIS
IS
IMHO
THE
ONLY
WAY
OF
EFFECTIVELY
PRO
TECTING
SOFTWARE
BEST
REGARDS
ARNO
I
STRONGLY
DISAGREE
I
THINK
MOST
PIRATING
IS
DONE
BY
AMATEURS
WHO
WONT
COPY
THE
PROGRAM
IF
DISKCOPY
CANT
DO
IT
IF
YOURE
TALKING
A
MAX
GOAL
OF
PIRATED
COPIES
I
BET
THAT
ANYTHING
THAT
WILL
BEAT
DISKCOPY
AND
CANT
BE
EASILY
COPIED
FROM
A
HARD
DRIVE
WILL
SUFFICE
I
HATE
HARD
COPY
MANUALS
AND
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
ALL
DOCS
ONLINE
NOT
BECAUSE
I
WANT
TO
COPY
THE
PROGRAM
BUT
BECAUSE
ITS
USUALLY
FASTER
AND
AND
CONVENIENT
THAN
SIFTING
THROUGH
AN
OLD
BOOK
I
CANT
FIND
OFF
DEEPER
END
WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
THINK
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
A
BACKUP
COPY
ALMOST
ALL
NEW
SOFTWARE
MUST
BE
INSTALLED
TO
THE
HARD
DISK
SO
YOU
ARE
LEFT
WITH
THE
ORIGINALS
AS
YOUR
BACKUPS
I
THINK
ITS
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
SPACE
AND
MONEY
AS
WELL
AS
IT
MAKES
IT
TO
TEMPTING
TO
LEND
OUT
THE
BACKUPS
NO
FLAMES
INTENDED
JUST
MY
THOUGHTS
