re
how
universal
are
phones
these
days
i
dont
know
much
about
phones
in
germany
but
this
is
what
i
know
i
bought
a
phone
in
the
us
for
my
mother
who
lives
in
bratislava
slovakia
and
it
works
just
fine
the
problem
is
they
dont
have
wall
jacks
like
we
do
here
there
is
a
wire
without
any
jack
at
the
end
sticking
out
of
the
wall
so
you
need
to
connect
the
wires
im
not
sure
if
they
have
wall
jacks
in
western
europe
they
may
hope
this
helps
