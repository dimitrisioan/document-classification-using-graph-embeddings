how
universal
are
phones
these
days
im
wondering
if
i
can
tote
my
american
touch
tone
phone
around
with
me
to
sweden
and
germany
its
dc
powered
and
i
can
buy
a
special
adapter
for
that
in
europe
the
question
is
if
the
general
electronics
work
the
same
i
can
buy
a
different
wall
plug
and
refit
it
im
sure
id
have
to
but
would
that
do
the
trick
thanks
hugo
