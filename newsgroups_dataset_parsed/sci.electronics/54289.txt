re
solvent
for
ducttape
adhesive
what
i
usually
useand
this
stuff
is
only
good
on
glassis
either
acetone
or
a
little
benzene
the
latter
of
the
two
is
a
bit
dangerous
possibly
a
carcinogensp
but
it
usualy
gets
the
job
done
i
imagine
you
can
you
the
two
solvents
on
most
metals
as
well
as
glass
but
keep
the
stuff
away
from
plastic
better
yet
you
may
just
want
to
go
to
your
local
hardware
store
and
ask
them
what
they
use
