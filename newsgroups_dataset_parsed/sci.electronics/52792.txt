THUS
A
DECIBELL
DECI
L
TENTH
OF
BELL
IS
A
FRACTIONAL
PART
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
BELL
FOR
EXAMPLE
SOUTHWESTERN
BELL
IS
A
DECIBELL
OUT
OF
WHAT
HAT
DID
YOU
PULL
THIS
ONE
DB
IS
A
RATIO
NOT
AN
RBOC
AND
THE
MEASURE
OF
CURRENT
AMP
IS
ACTUALLY
NAMED
AFTER
BOTH
THE
AMP
COMPANY
AND
THE
AMPHENOL
COMPANY
BOTH
COMPANIES
REVOLUTIONIZED
ELECTRONICS
BY
SIMULATENOUSLY
REALIZING
THAT
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
CONNECTORS
AND
SOCKETS
WERE
AFFECTED
BY
THE
AMOUNT
OF
CURRENT
RUNNING
THROUGH
THE
WIRES
SORRY
THE
UNIT
FOR
CURRENT
IS
THE
AMPERE
WHICH
IS
THE
NAME
OF
A
FRENCHMAN
NAMED
AMPERE
WHO
STUDIED
ELECTRICAL
CURRENT
THE
TERM
AMP
IS
JUST
AN
ABBREVIATION
OF
IT
THE
COMPANY
AMP
CAME
AFTER
THE
AMPERE
UNIT
WAS
ALREADY
IN
USE
THE
OHMITE
COMPANY
WAS
THE
FIRST
TO
CHARACTERIZE
RESISTANCES
BY
NUMBERS
THUS
OUR
USE
OF
THE
OHMS
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
ONE
BUT
IT
DOESNT
SOUND
RIGHT
ALEXANDER
GRAHAM
BELL
ACTUALLY
IS
WHERE
BELL
CAME
FROM
WELL
YOU
GOT
ONE
THING
RIGHT
ACTUALLY
I
THINK
J
CHIU
KNOWS
THE
SCORE
AND
IS
JUST
BEING
SILLY
HOWEVER
DECIBEL
IS
IN
FACT
OF
A
BEL
HE
IS
RIGHT
ON
THAT
ONE
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
WAS
ACCIDENTAL
OR
NOT
STRICTLY
DEFINED
A
BEL
IS
THE
RATIO
OF
THE
LOG
OF
TWO
POWER
LEVELS
AND
A
DECIBEL
IS
OF
A
BEL
SO
YOU
HAVE
DECIBELS
FOR
EVERY
BEL
HENCE
AND
THE
BEL
OHM
VOLT
FARAD
AMPERE
WATT
HERTZ
HENRY
ETC
ARE
ALL
NAMED
FOR
PIONEERS
IN
THE
FIELD
ITS
A
TRADITIONAL
AND
FINE
WAY
TO
HONOR
RESEARCHERS
WHO
DISCOVER
NEW
KNOWLEDGE
IN
A
NEW
FIELD
HERTZ
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
OF
THE
EARLY
ELECTRONICS
EXPLORERS
BUT
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
OUT
IN
HAVING
A
TERM
OR
UNIT
NAMED
AFTER
HIM
UNTIL
RECENTLY
PRIOR
TO
THAT
WHAT
IS
NOW
A
HERTZ
WAS
A
CPS
ALL
THE
OTHER
UNITS
WERE
DEFINED
MANY
DECADES
EARLIER
