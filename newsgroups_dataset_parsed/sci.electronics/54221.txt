THERES
A
SEEKER
BORN
EVERY
MINUTE
WRITES
WHERE
CAN
I
BUY
BLINKING
LEDS
BESIDES
RADIO
SHACK
DOES
ANYONE
SELL
BLINKING
LEDS
WITH
VARIABLE
FLASH
RATE
BY
VOLTAGE
I
GUESS
IF
SO
WHAT
HERTZ
PULSE
RATE
ARE
THEY
ADJUSTABLE
OR
SET
TO
ID
LIKE
BLINKING
LEDS
THAT
CAN
BE
SET
FOR
APPROX
HZ
HZ
HZ
OR
HZ
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
IM
INTERESTED
IN
WHATS
OUT
THERE
FOR
FLASH
RATES
I
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
LEDS
WITH
FLASHER
CIRCUITS
ALREADY
IN
THEM
I
HATE
SOLDERING
ICS
IN
GENERAL
GUESS
I
DONT
HAVE
A
HELL
OF
A
LOT
OF
PATIENCE
THANKS
DANA
IF
YOU
WANT
SLOW
LED
FLASH
RATES
ADJUSTABLE
BY
SWITCHES
OR
BY
A
DIGITALLY
CONTROLLED
SWITCH
I
SUGGEST
LOOKING
AT
A
OSCILLATOR
CHIP
THEY
COST
AT
RADIO
SHACK
MUCH
CHEAPER
IN
QUANTITY
AT
QUALITY
PLACES
AND
YOU
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
FIND
GOOD
INFO
ABOUT
SIMPLE
CIRCUITS
IN
A
OSCIALLTOR
NOTEBOOK
I
THINK
FOREST
MIMS
HAS
ONE
AT
RADIO
SHACK
YOULL
HAVE
TO
TOY
WITH
RESISTORCAPACITOR
VALUES
OR
YOU
CAN
USE
YOUR
HEAD
WITH
A
LITTLE
MATH
TO
GET
THE
RIGHT
FREQUENCIES
ANY
ENGINEER
WORTH
HIS
SALT
CAN
MAKE
A
OSCIALLATOR
ITS
IN
THE
BOOK
AND
LEFT
UP
TO
YOU
TO
SEE
I
HATE
DOING
ASCII
CIRCUIT
GRAPHICS
THE
CAN
ACCURATELY
GO
FROM
A
FEW
HZ
TO
ABOUT
KHZ
I
THINK
ABOUT
THE
TAPE
RECORDER
GIZMO
YOU
COULD
ALTER
A
STEREO
TAPE
DECK
TO
USE
ONE
CHANNEL
AS
A
DATA
LINE
FOR
FLASHING
LED
AND
ONE
AS
AUDIO
LINE
FOR
VOICE
OR
MUSIC
THIS
WOULD
ELIMINATE
A
LOT
OF
NOISE
THE
DATA
LINE
IS
PROBABLY
MOST
EASILY
DONE
BY
SOME
KIND
OF
PLL
OR
BANDPASS
FILTER
USING
JUST
AN
OPAMP
THE
CHIP
IS
A
GOOD
PLL
AND
NOT
HARD
TO
WORK
WITH
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
NOTHING
ABOUT
HOW
A
PLL
WORKS
I
SUGGEST
YOU
DONT
TRY
THIS
OPAMP
INFORMATION
CAN
ALSO
BE
FOUND
IN
THE
FOREST
MIMS
RADIO
SHACK
INFOBOOKLETS
AND
THE
POPULAR
OPAMP
IS
A
SNAP
TO
WORK
WITH
SETTING
FREQUENCY
AND
BANDPASS
FILTER
VALUES
ARE
NOT
SO
EASY
SO
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THE
METHOD
FIRSTMOST
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHAT
THIS
IS
GOING
INTO
SO
I
AM
REALLY
GENERALIZING
AS
FOR
MANUFACTURING
TECHNIQUES
IF
YOURE
ONLY
GOOFING
WITH
IT
I
SUGGEST
YOU
BREADBOARD
THE
THING
NO
NEED
TO
SOLDER
WIREWRAP
WOULD
BE
THE
NEXT
MORE
PERMANENT
STEP
AND
LASTLY
SOLDERINGPCB
MAKING
HOPE
THAT
CLEARS
