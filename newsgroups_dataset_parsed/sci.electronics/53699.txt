what

nuclear
sites
cooling

do

john

writes
during
the
nuclear
fission
reaction
the
uranium
fuel
can
get
hot
enough
to
melt
when
this
happens
the
liquid
uranium
is
pumped
to
the
cooling
tower
where
it
is
sprayed
into
the
air
contact
with
the
cool
outside
air
will
condense
the
mist
and
it
will
fall
back
to
the
cooling
tower
floor
there
it
is
collected
by
a
cleaning
crew
using
shop
vacs
and
is
then
reformed
into
pellets
for
reactor
use
the
next
day
cooling
towers
are
a
lot
taller
than
they
really
need
to
be
power
companies
are
forced
to
make
them
that
tall
by
some
enviromental
law
that
requires
the
raw
uranium
emisions
to
be
held
to
under
this
law
is
now
under
attack
by
lawyers
arguing
that
the
should
be
measured
at
the
edge
of
the
property
rather
than
the
edge
of
the
cooling
tower
eliminating
this
law
will
save
power
companies
thousands
of
dollars
in
concrete
costs
for
new
nukes

i
think
you
posted
your
article
days
too
late
april
is
over
i
dont
like
nuclear
powerplants
but
i
think
its
not
fair
to
tell
such
storys
about
them
ok
let
me
try
to
explain
what
that
tower
is
used
to
even
the
modernst
nuclear
powerplant
is
only
a
simple
steamengine
it
has
an
hightech
boiler
but
the
rest
is
still
verry
verry
conventional
and
if
youve
already
visited
any
condensation
powerstation
youl
have
seen
the
cooling
towers
too
if
you
look
at
any
good
book
about
thermophysics
youll
find
a
chapter
about
the
carnotprocess
which
describes
how
to
get
energy
from
a
temperature
difference
and
that
is
the
reason
for
cooling
towers
too
you
only
can
get
energy
if
youve
an
temperature
gradient
that
means
that
you
have
steam
on
the
one
side
and
need
to
cool
down
the
steam
till
you
get
water
again
on
the
other
side
if
you
want
to
get
aprox
of
the
energy
you
or
better
the
uranium
brought
into
the
water
to
let
it
boil
if
you
only
have
hot
steam
on
the
one
and
cold
steam
on
the
other
side
youll
loose
much
more
of
the
energy
and
so
they
cool
down
the
steam
to
get
at
least
the
of
energy
that
carnot
will
give
them
the
cooling
towers
are
for
cooling
the
steam
the
vapor
youll
see
is
not
the
steam
of
the
main
core
circulation
because
that
steam
is
radioactive
the
circulation
is
divided
in
at
least
circuits
connected
about
heat
exchangers
to
prevent
radioactive
pollution
of
the
environment
ok
the
main
core
is
hot
but
even
in
the
modernst
hightemperature
reactors
htr
they
only
run
at
deg
celsius
this
is
still
verry
far
away
from
uraniums
melting
point
which
is
somewhere
around
deg
celsius
but
youll
have
lots
of
problems
with
the
boilers
steel
thats
because
at
this
temperature
the
metal
is
attacked
by
steam
and
will
corrode
verry
fast
this
is
only
for
bwrs
the
new
he
cooled
reactors
have
temperatures
up
to
deg
celsius
but
this
is
only
experimental
i
personaly
think
that
nuclear
waste
should
be
as
low
as
ever
possible
because
the
dose
you
get
will
accumulate
about
the
years
today
mrem
and
next
year
mrem
wont
be
mrem
at
all
it
accumulates
and
even
in
years
youll
still
have
mrem
and
im
not
interested
in
glowing
in
the
night
and
getting
children
with
heads
this
is
my
point
of
view
