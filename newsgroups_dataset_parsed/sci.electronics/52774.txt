use
a
quartz

and
divide
its
frequency
by
times
or
something
like
that
wouldnt
a
crystal
be
affected
by
cold
my
gut
feeling
is
that
as
a
mechanically
resonating
device
extreme
cold
is
likely
to
affect
the
compliance
terminology
of
the
quartz
and
hence
its
resonant
frequency
yes
but
in
a
fairly
reproducible
way
is
only
a
smidgen
of
the
distance
to
absolute
zero
and
in
any
case
youre
going
to
have
to
borrow
freezer
space
from
a
bio
lab
or
someone
to
testcalibrate
this
darling
anyway
btw
youre
probably
going
to
want
those
big
capacitors
you
found
to
fire
the
solenoid
high
current
drain
on
frozen
batteries
can
be
an
ugly
thing
