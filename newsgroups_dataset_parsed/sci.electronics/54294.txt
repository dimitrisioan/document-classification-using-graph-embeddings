MR
Y
WRITES
I
AM
NOT
QUITE
SO
SURE
ABOUT
THE
ILLEGALITY
OF
USING
A
REGULAR
AMERICAN
PHONE
ON
YOUR
HOME
SYSTEM
I
VAGUELY
REMEMBER
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
DEUTSCHE
BUNDESPOST
SPLIT
INTO
POSTDIENST
POSTBANK
AND
TELEKOM
THERE
WAS
SOME
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
A
NEW
REGULATION
I
KNOW
THAT
CORDLESS
OR
CELLULAR
PHONES
STILL
HAVE
TO
BE
APPROVED
BY
THE
TELEKOM
BUT
DOES
THAT
HOLD
TRUE
FOR
REGULAR
PHONES
IN
MY
AREACODE
IN
GERMANY
FRECHEN
NEAR
KOELN
YOU
CAN
USE
TOUCHTONE
DIALING
I
ASSUME
HOWEVER
THAT
MOST
AREAS
ARE
STILL
EXCLUSIVELY
SET
TO
PULSE
DIALING
LAST
TIME
I
CHECKED
JAN
THE
COLOGNE
AREACODE
WAS
STILL
SOLELY
PULSE
DIALING
BTW
TOUCH
TONE
DOES
BECOME
MORE
COMMON
IN
GERMANY
BRINGIN
WITH
IT
THE
FLOURISHING
OF
SERVICES
IN
GERMANY
I
JUST
HOPE
WELL
ALL
HAVE
ISDN
SOME
TIME
AT
AN
AFFORDABLE
PRICE
IDLE
WISHES
DOES
THIS
IMPLY
THE
GERMAN
TONE
DIALING
IS
COMPATIBLE
WITH
THE
AMERICAN
ONE
I
KNOW
AT
LEAST
THE
BRITISH
SYSTEM
IS
NOT
IT
IS
SUPPOSEDLY
CLOSE
ENOUGH
THOUGH
THAT
AN
AMERICAN
PHONE
WILL
WORK
BUT
MY
MODEM
AMERICAN
HAS
A
SPECIAL
SETTING
FOR
BRITISH
STANDARDS
