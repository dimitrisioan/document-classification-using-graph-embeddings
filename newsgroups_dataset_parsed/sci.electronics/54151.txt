i
was
just
wondering
one
thing
actually
two
i
hope
that
this
is
the
proper
place
to
post
this
subject
why
does
a
lead
acid
battery
discharge
and
become
dead
totally
unuseable
when
stored
on
a
concrete
floor
i
decided
to
bring
the
battery
in
from
the
lawn
mower
and
the
motorcycle
from
the
unheated
garage
this
year
to
preserve
them
and
i
just
went
to
use
them
and
noticed
that
not
only
do
they
not
work
but
they
act
like
the
two
terminals
are
shorted
i
asked
a
friend
and
he
said
that
you
should
never
do
that
cause
it
ruins
them
but
he
couldnt
tell
me
why
its
not
the
concrete
floor
that
does
it
the
problem
is
that
leadacid
cells
self
discharge
over
time
even
high
quality
cells
gates
for
instance
will
discharge
over
a
month
period
of
time
nonsealed
cells
self
discharge
even
faster
if
the
battery
was
not
completly
charged
when
left
sitting
it
probably
discharged
past
the
the
point
where
cell
sulfiding
occurs
which
in
many
cases
means
a
ruined
battery
