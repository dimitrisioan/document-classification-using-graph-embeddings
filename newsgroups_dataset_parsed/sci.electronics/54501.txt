THE
DISCUSSION
UNDER
THE
OLD
TOPIC
WENT
IN
THE
WRONG
DIRECTION
SOME
PEOPLE
INSTEAD
OF
DISCUSSING
THE
ISSUE
ITSELF
THEY
DECIDED
TO
DISCUSS
THE
NONTECHNICAL
PART
OF
THE
ISSUE
SO
HERE
I
GO
WITH
MY
LIMITED
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
THIS
ISSUE
HOPING
YOU
GUYS
CUT
THE
CRAP
AND
TALK
ABOUT
THE
REAL
TECHNICAL
WAYS
TO
DO
THIS
THE
METHODS
THAT
I
AM
AWARE
THAT
ARE
EFFECTIVE
ARE
LASER
HOLE
BURNING
THIS
WOULD
LEAVE
THE
DISK
DAMAGED
SO
IF
YOU
FORMAT
THAT
PARTICULAR
SECTOR
OF
THE
DISK
YOU
CAN
NOT
WRITE
TO
IT
IT
IS
VERY
LASER
HOLES
ARE
OR
WERE
USED
TO
PREVENT
SOMEONE
FROM
MAKING
EXACT
COPIES
OF
A
DISK
YOU
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
WRITE
TO
THE
DAMAGED
DISK
ONLY
READ
AND
USE
THE
PROGRAMS
HARD
FOR
CRACKERS
TO
DAMAGE
THE
DISK
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
WAY
I
REMEMBER
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
COPYWRITE
THAT
COULD
COPY
A
DISK
WITH
A
LASER
HOLE
IN
IT
I
THINK
IT
SIMULATES
THE
LASER
HOLE
AFTER
COPYING
THE
DISK
THE
PROGRAM
IS
IF
NECESSARY
USED
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
NOKEY
OR
SOMETHING
THE
PROGRAM
TELLS
YOU
WHICH
PROGRAM
TO
USE
NO
SOLUTION
GERRIT
