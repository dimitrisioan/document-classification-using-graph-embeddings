my
goal
is
to
come
up
with
an
inexpensive
design
for
a
receiver
back
end
with
if
input
on
one
end
and
an
fsk
demondulator
on
the
other
im
particularly
interested
in
ways
to
use
a
higher
if
than
do
any
current
chips
work
up
to
say
with
internal
downconversion
so
a
normal
if
filter
can
be
used
gecplessey
specify
a
series
of
fm
demodulators
etc
for
use
in
satellite
tv
receivers
or
in
of
baseband
video
out
i
think
theres
also
a
related
data
slicer
clock
recovery
circuit
intended
for
use
in
dmac
decoders
though
that
isnt
used
in
the
most
common
implementation
it
may
not
be
in
volume
production
the
most
easily
available
components
probably
vary
with
local
satellite
standards
and
i
think
the
european
systems
vary
rather
widely
from
those
in
the
us
so
it
may
be
worth
investigating
locallyavailable
receiver
designs
to
find
out
whats
in
common
use
