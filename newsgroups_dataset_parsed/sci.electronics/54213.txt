hmmm
what
is
the
problem
with
parallel
port
security
keys
i
havent
used
anything
that
had
hardware
key
copy
protection
schemes
so
i
dont
know
what
the
drawbacks
are
i
know
the
companies
that
make
them
claim
theyre
uncrackable
but
ive
seen
cracks
of
autodesk
floating
around
i
dont
have
one
so
dont
ask
and
i
had
heard
that
it
had
parralel
port
keys
if
you
put
another
computer
on
the
port
instead
of
the
key
you
can
hack
them
by
reading
what
happens
so
ive
been
told
ive
never
seen
this
done
but
i
think
its
possible
youd
need
some
hardware
knowledge
and
some
software
to
read
the
port

my
apologies
if
i
rambled
but

skills

valid
until
may
listen
very
carefully
i
will
say
this
only
once
michelle
of
the
resitance
