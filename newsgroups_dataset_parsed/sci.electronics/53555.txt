just
a
thought
of
mine
here
since
an
onhook
line
is
aprox
and
offhook
it
usually
drops
below
how
about
an
led
in
series
with
a
zener
say
around
onhook
led
on
offhook
led
off
would
this
work
if
anyone
triestried
it
please
let
me
know
aye
theres
the
rub
if
you
draw
enough
current
to
light
an
led
the
equipment
at
the
phone
company
will
think
youve
gone
off
hook
in
the
onhook
state
youre
not
supposed
to
draw
current
which
means
you
should
just
use
your
digital
voltmeter
you
can
use
an
old
vom
but
the
phone
company
equipment
can
detect
that
and
might
think
theres
something
wrong
with
the
cable
look
guys
whats
the
problem
here
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
off
hook
all
you
need
it
to
run
it
in
series
with
the
line
as
i
mentioned
in
my
previous
post
if
you
want
a
light
that
goes
on
when
the
phone
is
on
hook
all
you
need
is
a
voltage
threshold
detector
if
youre
going
to
do
the
series
diode
thing
which
is
the
easiest
just
make
sure
that
the
led
can
take
the
current
i
cant
recall
it
offhand
but
its
something
like
or
more
careful
now
folks
also
consider
the
that
is
forced
on
ring
and
tip
when
the
phones
supposed
to
ring
even
with
a
simple
zener
and
led
setup
you
might
end
up
with
some
carbon
real
quick
whatever
scheme
you
use
make
sure
youve
got
at
least
components
on
the
frontend
also
remember
that
if
im
not
mistaken
the
phone
line
is
a
equivalent
circuit
any
current
you
draw
from
the
or
so
gets
dropped
across
that
thats
fine
until
youre
down
to
roughly
when
ma
bell
considers
it
to
be
offhook
but
dropping
it
that
far
down
is
probably
a
big
nono
the
easiest
implementation
to
accomplish
the
above
tip
rectifier
resistor
diode
v
zener
resistor
v
led
ring
this
is
only
a
suggestiongo
ahead
and
blow
holes
in
it
but
you
get
the
idea
choose
a
highefficiency
led
so
you
dont
need
much
current
to
get
it
to
light
up
choose
values
for
the
other
components
as
required
