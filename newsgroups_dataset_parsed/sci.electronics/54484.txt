i
designed
and
built
hardware
in
that
would
output
a
logic
level
from
a
tone
detector
upon
detecting
a
microwatt
led
feet
away
used
a
motorola
biased
linearly
in
a
dcfeedback
loop
to
servo
out
variations
in

i
would
be
interested
in
knowing
more
about
the
sensing
hardware
what
did
you
use
for
the
detector
could
you
detect
the
angle
of
location
or
did
the
system
simply
respond
to
the
presence
of
the
transmitter
in
the
sensors
field
of
view
phototransistor
with
limiter
feedback
to
base
to
control
operating
point
i
expect
this
really
hurts
noise
figure
any
comments
from
phototransistor
experts
we
intended
to
use
this
atop
a
stepper
motor
to
provide
headings
to
the
beacons
the
plan
was
to
have
or
beacons
of
different
frequencies
in
each
room
and
tell
the
what
frequency
to
phaselock
to
we
did
not
do
so
one
challenge
was
that
the
available
stepper
had
degree
steps
knowing
the
headings
to
each
beacon
we
would
have
used
the
surveyor
technique
of
resection
to
determine
robot
location
no
i
aint
going
to
explain
resection
over
the
net
given
hindsight
i
would
digitize
the
amplified
output
of
the
selfnulling
phototransistor
circuit
and
correlate
inphase
quadrature
squarewaves
at
the
several
expected
frequencies
to
extract
amplitude
of
each
beacon
by
doing
this
at
the
numerous
steps
even
with
degree
steps
with
knowledge
of
the
angular
response
of
the
phototransistor
you
should
be
able
to
rather
more
accurately
determine
the
heading
to
each
beacon
