HAMS
CAN
LEGALLY
RUN
UP
TO
WATTS
IT
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
HOWEVER
THAT
A
HAM
WOULD
BE
RUNNING
THAT
KIND
OF
POWER
FROM
A
CAR
HAM
RIGS
NOT
POSSIBLE
EITHER
YOUD
NEED
ABOUT
A
AMP
ALTERNATOR
FOR
JUST
THE
AMPLIFIER
I
CAN
JUST
SEE
IT
YOU
NEED
TO
SLOW
DOWN
ON
A
DOWNGRADE
SO
YOU
HIT
THE
PUSH
TO
TALK
BUTTON
NOW
THAT
INDEED
IS
POSSIBLE
A
GOOD
FRIEND
OF
MINE
IS
RUNNING
ABOUT
KW
PEP
FROM
HIS
CAR
YES
HE
DOES
HAVE
A
SECOND
ALTERNATOR
YES
HE
CALLS
THE
RIG
AN
ELECTRONIC
BRAKE
SINCE
THE
ENGINE
NOTICEABLY
SLOWS
WHEN
THE
KEY
IS
DOWN
MY
CAR
UNFORTUNATELY
HAS
SO
MUCH
COMPUTER
JUNK
UNDER
THE
HOOD
THAT
ITS
ASTONISHINGLY
SENSITIVE
TO
RFI
IF
I
KEY
A
HT
OVER
THE
ENGINE
WITH
THE
HOOD
OPEN
THE
CAR
LOSES
TIMING
DUE
TO
THE
RF
LEAKING
INTO
THE
DISTRIBUTOR
PICKUP
VERY
POOR
DESIGN
I
WILL
HOWEVER
POINT
OUT
THAT
HAM
RADIO
OPERATORS
ARE
USUALLY
QUITE
WILLING
TO
HELP
WHEN
INTERFERENCE
IS
DETECTED
REMEMBER
THAT
ANY
INTERFERENCE
IS
WASTED
POWER
IF
I
PUT
OUT
IN
THE
TV
BAND
THATS
THAT
I
AM
NOT
PUTTING
OUT
IN
THE
BAND
I
AM
TRYING
TO
TRANSMIT
ON
AND
CAN
OFTEN
BE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
NICE
CARD
HANGING
ON
THE
WALL
AND
NOTHING
CBERS
HOWEVER
ARE
USUALLY
NOT
AS
HELPFUL
MOST
ILLEGAL
CBERS
HOWEVER
WILL
STOP
OPERATION
WHEN
YOU
INFORM
THEM
OF
A
PROBLEM
THE
REST
OF
THEM
WILL
STOP
OPERATION
WHEN
YOU
INFORM
THE
LOCAL
FCC
OFFICE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IN
WRITING
AND
GIVING
DETAILS
AND
ADDRESSES
LAST
YOU
CAN
USUALLY
TELL
HAM
RADIO
VS
CB
HAM
OPERATORS
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
DECLARE
THEIR
CALL
SIGN
EVERY
SO
MANY
MINUTES
NO
MORE
THAN
SO
IF
YOU
HEAR
THIS
IS
OR
SOME
OTHER
CALL
STARTING
WITH
A
W
OR
K
AND
NO
MORE
THAN
TOTAL
CHARACTERS
YOU
HEARD
A
HAM
CBERS
PROBABLY
WONT
SIGN
I
DONT
KNOW
THAT
THEYRE
EVEN
REQUIRED
TO
AND
FIREPOLICE
HAVE
OTHER
PRIVATE
IDS
GOOD
ADVICE
HAMS
WILL
FREQUENTLY
GIVE
THEIR
CALL
AND
WILL
NEVER
USE
A
HANDLE
THEY
ARE
LESS
APT
TO
USE
IMMENSE
AMOUNTS
OF
PROFANITY
AS
WELL
BUT
THATS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
THEY
DONT
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
