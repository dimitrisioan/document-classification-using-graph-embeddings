the
color
of
the
board
shows
the
composition
of
it
hence
the
use
of
it
original
and
older
boards
were
bakelite
composition
and
were
brown
phenolic
spelling
was
a
tan
most
non
filled
fiberglass
boards
used
in
computers
are
green
filled
fiberglass
is
blue
teflon
is
white
rubbish
the
reason
for
the
colour
of
the
boards
depends
on
the
solder
mask
that
is
used
older
boards
bakelite
and
phenolic
rarely
used
a
solder
mask
these
boards
are
not
suited
well
to
automatic
stuffing
and
soldering
techniques
and
hence
are
the
colour
of
the
compound
used
to
make
them
these
days
boards
are
made
of
fibreglass
for
most
general
purpose
uses
and
have
a
solder
mask
applied
to
them
to
prevent
close
traces
shorting
to
one
another
during
soldering
and
also
to
prevent
the
decomposition
of
traces
under
harsh
environments
the
light
and
dark
green
boards
ofter
seen
have
a
dry
film
mask
applied
to
them
usually
applied
as
a
complete
film
photographically
produced
the
blue
and
red
or
orange
boards
are
a
twopart
epoxy
or
a
liquidimageable
resist
formulation
and
are
applied
in
a
different
manner
theres
a
lot
of
info
about
the
pros
and
cons
of
each
but
thats
another
story

sorry
geoff
agree
solder
mask
is
green
but
in
the
old
days
we
didnt
have
wave
soldering
machines
which
are
another
topic
again
i
had
a
crew
of
a
dozen
ladies
which
could
stuff
and
hand
solder
a
board
like
lightning
board
under
the
mask
was
the
original
query
btw
cheap
inport
electronic
devices
mainly
from
world
countries
are
done
with
brown
pheonolic
boards
is
seems
the
electronics
industry
has
discovered
the
cheap
labor
pools
workers
are
paid
by
the
board
to
assemble
circuits
at
home
they
are
very
obviously
hand
soldered
quite
a
few
tape
recorders
are
being
brought
into
canada
from
red
china
in
china
there
is
no
warranty
for
the
equipment
other
than
if
you
plug
it
in
and
it
works
its
yours
one
of
my
coworkers
spent
a
year
there
and
he
said
the
failure
rate
out
of
the
box
was
almost
also
the
original
method
for
making
printed
with
conductive
ink
on
a
regular
printing
press
an
old
lithographer
friend
had
a
press
for
this
after
the
etching
method
was
developed
he
used
the
press
to
print
wood
grain
on
doors
