hi
i
was
doing
research
on
subliminal
suggestion
for
a
psychology
paper
and
i
read
that
one
researcher
flashed
hidden
messages
on
the
tv
screen
at
of
a
second
is
that
possible
i
thought
the
take
a
look
over
in
altfolkloreurban
there
is
a
thread
about
subliminal
messages
on
tv
the
fact
that
subliminal
messages
dont
work
aside
an
image
cant
be
flashed
on
a
tv
screen
fast
enough
to
not
be
noticed
well
yes
and
no
the
image
cant
be
on
the
screen
less
than
of
a
second
but
a
mixture
of
images
thats
about
of
the
field
that
was
supposed
to
be
there
and
of
the
subliminal
addition
could
be
overlaid
for
one
field
producing
the
same
overall
effect
to
our
sluggish
retinae
of
a
discrete
image
projected
for
second
although
like
the
previous
poster
i
have
to
reserve
my
doubts
about
the
effectiveness
of
said
discrete
image
in
steering
my
subconscious
around
