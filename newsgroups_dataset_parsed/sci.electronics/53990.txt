WRITES
IM
WONDERING
IF
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
USE
RADIO
WAVES
TO
MEASURE
THE
DISTANCE
BETWEEN
A
TRANSMITTERS
AND
RECEIVER
YES
ITS
CALLED
RADAR
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
MEASURE
THE
SIGNAL
STRENGTH
AND
DETERMINE
DISTANCE
THIS
WOULD
BE
FOR
SHORT
DISTANCES
FT
AND
I
WOULD
NEED
TO
HAVE
ACCURACY
OF
INCHES
OR
SO
DEPENDS
ON
THE
ENVIRONMENT
IN
A
STATIC
ENVIRONENT
SUCH
AS
A
WAVEGUIDE
YES
IN
A
DYNAMIC
ENVIRONMENT
WITH
OBJECTS
MOVING
ABOUT
THE
MULTIPATH
KILLS
THIS
CONCEPT
HOW
ABOUT
MEASURING
VERTICAL
DISTANCE
AS
WELL
ANY
CHANCE
OR
AM
I
GETTING
RIDICULOUS
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
VERTICAL
AND
HORIZONTAL
WHAT
FREQUENCIES
WOULD
BE
BEST
FOR
THIS
OR
DOES
MATTER
THIS
DEPENDS
ON
THE
REQUIRED
RANGE
THE
REQUIRED
ACCURACY
