WAS
RE
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
OUTLET
WIRING
THERE
HAS
BEEN
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
DISCUSSION
ABOUT

WIRING
AND
GROUNDING
PRACTICES
HERE
A
FEW
POINTS
NEED
TO
BE
CLARIFIED
THE
EQUIPMENT
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
GREEN
GREEN
WITH
A
YELLOW
STRIPE
BARE
OR
THE
METAL
SHEATH
OR

OF
SOME
WIRING
METHODS
IS
USED
AS
A
SAFETY
GROUND
TO
CARRY
FAULT
CURRENTS
BACK
TO
THE
CIRCUIT
BREAKER
PANEL
AND
TO
LIMIT
THE
VOLTAGE
ON
THE
METAL
CASE
OF
UTILIZATION
EQUIPMENT
OR
OTHER
METAL
OBJECTS
IT
SHOULD
NEVER
EXCEPT
FOR
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONS
TO
BE
DISCUSSED
LATER
CARRY
THE
NORMAL
OPERATING
CURRENT
OF
A
CONNECTED

SOME
EQUIPMENT
HAS
FILTERS
IN
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
WHICH
MAY
CAUSE
SOME
SLIGHT
CURRENT
FLOW
THROUGH
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
MUCH
COMMUNICATIONS
OR
AUDIO
EQUIPMENT
IS
SENSITIVE
TO
NOISE
OR
SLIGHT
VOLTAGES
ON
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
AND
MAY
REQUIRE
SPECIAL
WIRING
OF
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTORS
TO
PROVIDE
RELIABLE
OPERATION
ORANGE
OUTLETS
ARE
OFTEN
USED
FOR
THIS
WITH
INSULATED
GROUNDING
CONDUCTORS
WIRED
BACK
TO
THE
PANEL
BOX
AND
IN
MANY
CASES
BACK
TO
THE
SERVICE
ANYONE
INSTALLING
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
SHOULD
READ
BOTH
THE
SECTION
ON
GROUNDING
IN
THE
NATIONAL
ELECTRIC
CODE
AND
PUBLICATIONS
ON
INSTALLING
QUIET
ISOLATED
GROUND
SYSTEMS
THE
CODE
REQUIRES
THE
INSULATED
GROUNDING
CONDUCTORS
GREEN
WIRES
TO
RUN
WITH
THE
CURRENT
CARRYING
CONDUCTORS
BACK
TO
THE
PANEL
BOX
AND
IF
REQUIRED
BACK
ALL
THE
WAY
TO
THE
SERVICE
ENTRANCE
WHERE
IT
IS
BONDED
TO
THE
SERVICE
GROUND
WATER
PIPE
OR

MANY
OF
THESE
SYSTEMS
ARE
INSTALLED
ILLEGALLY
OR
UNSAFELY
WHERE
THEY
DO
NOT
PROVIDE
A
SAFE
GROUND
OR
A
QUIET
GROUND
OR
EITHER
THE
GROUNDED
CONDUCTOR
OF
A
CIRCUIT
OFTEN
CALLED
THE
NEUTRAL
WHICH
IS
REFERRED
TO
IN
THE
CODE
AS
THE
IDENTIFIED
CONDUCTOR
AND
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
WHITE
OR
NATURAL
GREY
THIS
CONDUCTOR
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
CONNECTED
TO
GROUND
IN
MOST
ELECTRICAL
SYSTEMS
AT
A
SINGLE
POINT
GENERALLY
AT
THE
SERVICE
ENTRANCE
PANEL
THIS
CONNECTION
IS
THROUGH
THE
MAIN
BONDING
JUMPER
IN
MANY
HOUSEHOLD
SERVICE
PANELS
THE
MAIN
BONDING
JUMPER
IS
ACTUALLY
A
BONDING
SCREW
WHICH
ATTACHES
THE
NEUTRAL
BUSBAR
TO
THE
CASE
OF
THE
PANEL
THE
GROUNDED
CONDUCTOR
NEUTRAL
IS
GENERALLY
A
CURRENT
CARRYING
CONDUCTOR
IN
THE
CASE
OF
A
VOLT
CIRCUIT
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
CONDUCTORS
COMPLETING
THE
CIRCUIT
FROM
THE
PANEL
TO
THE
LOAD
DEVICE
SINCE
THE
GROUNDED
CONDUCTOR
NEUTRAL
IS
ONLY
CONNECTED
TO
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
BARE
OR
GREEN
AT
THE
SERVICE
ENTRANCE
IF
THE
LOAD
IS
ANY
DISTANCE
FROM
THE
SERVICE
AND
DRAWS
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
CURRENT
THERE
WILL
BE
A
SMALL
BUT
MEASURABLE
VOLTAGE
BETWEEN
THE
GROUNDED
AND
GROUNDING
CONDUCTORS
AT
THE
LOAD
UNDER
NORMAL
OPERATING
CONDITIONS
IF
YOU
SHOULD
INCORRECTLY
CONNECT
THE
GROUNDED
NEUTRAL
CONDUCTOR
TO
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
AT
THE
LOAD
SOME
OF
THE
NEUTRAL
CURRENT
WILL
FLOW
INSTEAD
THROUGH
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
SINCE
THERE
WILL
NOW
BE
CURRENT
FLOWING
THROUGH
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
IT
WILL
ALSO
NO
LONGER
BE
QUITE
AT
GROUND
POTENTIAL
AT
THE
LOAD
END
IF
THE
LOAD
EQUIPMENT
HAS
A
METAL
CASE
WHICH
IS
CONNECTED
TO
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
THROUGH
THE
U
GROUND
PLUG
THE
METAL
CASE
IS
NOW
ALSO
NO
LONGER
QUITE
AT
GROUND
POTENTIAL
THE
DIFFERENCE
UNDER
NORMAL
NON
SHORTCIRCUIT
CONDITIONS
MAY
BE
ONLY
A
FEW
TENTHS
OF
A
VOLT
BUT
IT
COULD
ALSO
BE
A
VOLT
OR
TWO
THIS
NORMALLY
DOES
NOT
PRESENT
A
SHOCK
HAZARD
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
LET
THE
METAL
CASE
OF
THE
GROUNDED
EQUIPMENT
COME
INTO
CONTACT
WITH
AN
INDEPENDENTLY
GROUNDED
OBJECT
SUCH
AS
A
WATER
OR
GAS
PIPE
A
RADIATOR
A
METAL
AIR
CONDITIONING
DUCT
OR
SUCH
PART
OF
THE
NEUTRAL
CURRENT
WILL
TRY
TO
FLOW
THROUGH
THIS
AALTERNATE
GROUND
PATH
IF
THE
CONTACT
IS
NOT
SOLID
YOU
WILL
GET
A
SIGNIFICANT
ARC
A
LOW
VOLTAGE
BUT
POSSIBLY
MODERATE
CURRENT
ARC
UNDER
THE
WRONG
CONDITIONS
THIS
ARCING
COULD
START
A
FIRE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
IN
SOME
CASES
THAT
THE
SNEAK
GROUND
CURRENT
COULD
ALSO
FLOW
THROUGH
A
WIRE
OF
INADEQUATE
SIZE
CAUSING
IT
TO
OVERHEAT
WITH
THE
INCORRECT
NON
SINGLEPOINT
GROUNDING
OF
THE
NEUTRAL
IF
THERE
IS
A
SHORT
CIRCUIT
FROM
HOT
TO
NEUTRAL
THE
HIGH
SHORT
CIRCUIT
CURRENT
WHICH
MAY
FLOW
WILL
CAUSE
A
MUCH
HIGHER
VOLTAGE
ON
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
WHICH
INCREASES
THE
POSSIBILITY
FOR
SHOCK
OR
FIRE
ALSO
IF
YOU
INCORRECTLY
MULTIPLY
CONNECT
THE
NEUTRAL
AND
GROUND
THE
VOLTAGE
ON
THE
GROUND
SYSTEM
IS
SEEN
AS
NOISE
BU
COMPUTER
OR
AUDIO
EQUIPMENT
OFTEN
CAUSING
MALFUNCTION
I
HAVE
SPENT
SOME
HOURS
TRACKING
DOWN
SUCH
SHORTS
IN
TECHNICAL
FACILITIES
WHERE
THEY
WERE
INDUCING
SEVERE
HUM
INTO
EQUIPMENT
THE
NEUTRAL
IS
USUALLY
BONDED
TO
THE
GROUND
AT
THE
DISTRIBUTION
TRANSFORMER
AS
WELL
AS
AT
THE
SERVICE
ENTRANCE
OF
EACH
DWELLING
THIS
IS
DONE
PRIMARILY
FOR
LIGHTNING
PROTECTION
SO
THAT
INDUCED
LIGHTNING
CURRENTS
HAVE
A
SHORT
PATH
BACK
TO
GROUND
AND
ALSO
TO
ASSURE
THAT
THE
CURRENTS
DRAWN
BY
SHORTS
TO
GROUNDED
OBJECTS
LIKE
PIPES
DRAW
ENOUGH
CURRENT
TO
TRIP
CIRCUIT
BREAKERS
OR
BLOW
FUSES
QUICKLY
THE
BAD
SIDE
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
NOT
ALL
THE
NEUTRAL
CURRENT
FROM
THE
DWELLING
GOES
THROUGH
THE
NEUTRAL
WIRE
BACK
TO
THE
TRANSFORMER
SOME
OF
IT
FLOWS
THROUGH
THE
GROUNDING
ELECTRODE
WATER
PIPE
ETC
THIS
MAY
CAUSE
CORROSION
IN
THE
PIPES
AND
POSSIBLY
IN
THINGS
LIKE
UNDERGROUND
FUEL
OIL
TANKS
AND
IT
MAY
ALSO
CAUSE
MEASURABLE
AC
MAGNETIC
FIELDS
DUE
TO
THE
LARGE
LOOP
BETWEEN
THE
HOT
CONDUCTORS
IN
THE
SERVICE
AND
THE
NEUTRAL
CURRENT
IN
THE
WATER
PIPE
AND
GROUND
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
FEEL
THESE
FIELDS
MAY
BE
UNHEALTHY
DONT
FLAME
ME
ON
THIS
IM
JUST
TELLING
YOU
WHERE
THE
FIELD
COMES
FROM
NOT
ITS
HEALTH
EFFECT
AS
FAR
AS
IM
CONCERNED
THE
JURY
IS
STILL
OUT
ON
THIS
NOTE
THAT
THE
BONDING
JUMPER
IS
ONLY
INSTALLED
AT
THE
MAIN
PANEL
NOT
AT
ANY
SUB
DISTRIBUTION
PANELS
THIS
IS
ONE
REASON
WHY
IT
IS
ILLEGAL
TO
RUN
SERVICE
ENTRANCE
CABLE
WITH
THE
SHEATH
USED
AS
A
NEUTRAL
TO
A
SUB
PANEL
YOU
MUST
HAVE
A
SEPERATE
INSULATED
CONDUCTOR
FOR
THE

THE
SHEATH
CAN
BE
USED
IN
THIS
APPLICATION
ONLY
AS
THE
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
IF
THE

IS
BONDED
TO
THE

CONDUCTOR
IN
THE

SAY
BY
FORGETTING
TO
REMOVE
THE
BONDING
SCREW
ALL
THE

CONDUCTORS
OF
THE
LOADS
ON
THAT

WILL
BE
ABOVE

WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
PROBLEMS
LISTED
ABOVE
THE

MAKES
EXCEPTIONS
FOR
RANGES
AND

AS
WELL
AS
FEEDS
FROM
ONE
BUILDING
TO
ANOTHER
IN
THE
CASES
OF
THE

AND
DRYER
THE

MAY
BE
USED
AS
THE

GROUND
UNDER
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
INSTEAD
OF
A
SEPERATE
WIRE
EVERY
TIME
THE
CODE
IS
REVISED
THESE
EXCEPTIONS
COME
UP
FOR
REVIEW
THESE
EXCEPTIONS
WERE
IN
FACT
THE
FIRST
REQUIRED
SAFETY
GROUNDS
IN
THE
DAYS
BEFORE
U
GROUND
OUTLETS
AND
SUCH
THE
APPLIANCE
MANUFACTURERS
DONT
WANT
TO
HAVE
TO
REDESIGN
THEIR
RANGES
AND
DRIERS
AND
THE
CONTRACTORS
DONT
WANT
TO
HAVE
TO
RUN
FOUR
WIRE
CABLE
WITH
FOUR
FAIRLY
HEAVY
EXPENSIVE
WIRES
IN
PLACE
OF
THREE
WIRE
TO
THE
APPLIANCES
NO
QUESTION
IT
WOULD
BE
SAFER
WITH
SEPERATE
NEUTRALS
TO
THE
STOVE
BUT
THE
NEUTRAL
CURRENT
IS
LOW
FOR
MOST
BURNER
SETTINGS
SINCE
MOST
CURRENT
IS
IN
THE
VOLT
HOTS
EXCEPT
AT
SOME
LOW
SETTINGS
THE
WIRES
ARE
LARGE
GAUGE
AND
THERE
ARE
FEW
REPORTED
CASES
OF
INJURY
OR
DAMAGE
SO
FAR
THE
EXCEPTIONS
HAVE
SURVIVED
IN
THE
CASE
OF
FEEDS
BETWEEN

ITS
PRIMARILY
FOR
LIGHTNING
PROTECTION
PEOPLE
DOING
WIRING
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
WHAT
IS
AND
WHAT
ISNT
A
LEGAL
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
OBVIOUSLY
THE
BARE
WIRE
IN
ROMEX
WITH
GROUND
IS
ANYWHERE
THERE
IS
A
GREEN
WIRE
INSTALLED
SUCH
AS
IN
A
PORTABLE
CORD
THAT
IS
A
GOOD
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
THE
SHEATH
OF
BX
CLAMPED
IN
BX
CONNECTORS
IN
METAL
BOXES
IS
A
LEGAL
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
IN
THE
US
BX
HAS
AN
ALUMINUM
BAND
RUN
UNDER
THE
STEEL
SHEATH
TO
LOWER
THE
RESISTANCE
OF
THE

YOU
CAN
JUST
CUT
THIS
ALUMINUM

OFF
AT
THE

YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
BOND
IT
TO
ANYTHING
IT
DOES
ITS
JOB
BY
TOUCHING
EVERY

OF
THE
BX
SHEATH
CONDUIT
OR
EMT
THINWALL
TUBING
IS
GENERALLY
A
LEGAL
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
BUT
MAY
REQUIRE
A
BONDING
LOCKNUT
WHERE
IT
ENTERS
A
BOX
OR
PANEL
PARTICULARLY
FOR
LARGER
PIPES
GREENFIELD
LOOKS
LIKE
BIG
BX
BUT
YOU
PULL
YOUR
OWN
WIRES
IN
THE
EMPTY
SHEATH
AFTER
YOU
RUN
IT
IS
NOT
A
LEGAL
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
AS
IT
DOESNT
HAVE
THE
ALUMINUM
BAND
TO
BOND
IT
AND
THE
SPIRAL
STEEL
HAS
TOO
MUCH
RESISTANCE
AND
INDUCTANCE
YOU
HAVE
TO
RUN
A
SEPERATE
GREEN
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
INSIDE
THE
GREENFIELD
WIREMOLD
IS
ALSO
NOT
A
LEGAL
GROUNDING
CONDUCTOR
AS
THE
PAINT
ON
THE

OFTEN
PREVENTS
GOOD
CONTACT
AND
THE
FEED
TO
THE

EXTENSION
IS
OFTEN
FROM
A

IN
THE

THAT
MAY
NOT
BE
WELL
CONNECTED
TO
THE

I
HAVE
PERSONALLY
DISCOVERED
CASES
WHERE
THE
ENTIRE

OF
WIREMOLD
AND
THE
CASES
OF
EVERYTHING
PLUGGED
INTO
ALL
THE
OUTLETS
ON
THE

WERE
HOT
WITH

WHY
DO
I
GET
A
SHOCK
EVERY
TIME
I
TOUCH
MY

AND
THE
RADIATOR
HERE
IN
THE

BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
NO
GROUND
WIRE
IN
THE

AND
ONE
OF
THE
OUTLETS
HAD
SHORTED
TO
THE
EDGE
OF
THE

YOU
MUST
RUN
A

BACK
IN
THE

FROM
THE

AT

TO
THE

IN
THE

WHERE
YOU
CAN

WHATEVER

WHILE
YOU
SHOULD
GROUND
THE
GREEN

ON

OUTLETS
WHEN
EVER
THERE
IS
A
PLACE
TO
GROUND
THEM
IT
IS
LEGAL
IN
THE
NEC
TO
USE
THEM
WITHOUT
A

IF
NO

IS

IT
IS
BETTER
TO
HAVE
THE

OF

FAULT
INTERRUPTER
THAN
NO

IF
YOU
DONT
INSTALL
IT
THE
INTERRUPTER
DOESNT
DEPEND
ON
THE

TO

IT
IS
DESIRABLE
TO
CONNECT
THE

IF

BECAUSE
IF
THE

IS

THE

WILL
TRIP
AS
SOON
AS
