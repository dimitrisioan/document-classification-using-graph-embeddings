RE
HOW
TO
THE
DISKS
COPY
PROTECTED
IN
ARTICLE
KUOSHENG
KASEY
CHANG
WRITES
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
TYPES
OF
COPY
PROTECTION
AND
THE
POINT
IS
TO
MAKE
SURE
THE
USER
IS
USING
A
LEGITIMATE
COPY
THE
SIMPLEST
AND
VIRTUALLY
FOOLPROOF
WAY
IS
FOR
THE
PROGRAM
TO
SOMEHOW
FIXATE
ITSELF
TO
THE
MACHINE
IT
WAS
INSTALLED
ON
SOME
SORT
OF
CHECKSUM
SERIAL
NUMBER
WHATEVER
SO
A
COPY
PUT
ON
A
DIFFERENT
MACHINE
NOT
INSTALLED
FROM
ORIGINAL
DISKS
WILL
NOT
WORK
OKAY
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
IF
SOME
PART
OF
THE
MACHINE
PRESUMABLY
THE
PART
ON
WHICH
THE
CODE
NUMBER
OR
WHATEVER
THAT
THE
PROGRAM
HAS
FIXATED
ITSELF
UPON
GOES
BAD
YOU
REPLACE
THAT
PART
AND
NOW
YOUR
PROGRAM
WONT
RUN
BECAUSE
ITS
ON
A
DIFFERENT
COMPUTER
THIS
IS
OF
COURSE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
PROGRAM
USES
SOMETHING
IN
ROM
LIKE
THE
BIOS
SERIAL
NUMBER
MAYBE
AND
NOT
A
DISKBASED
CODE
NUMBER
OBVIOUSLY
IF
THE
DRIVE
GOES
BAD
YOULL
BE
REINSTALLING
THE
STUFF
ANYWAY
I
WORK
IN
A
COMPUTER
LAB
WHICH
IS
PART
OF
THE
UNIVERSITY
MICROLAB
SYSTEM
WE
HAVE
THE
WONDERFULLY
FUN
TASK
OF
MAINTAINING
WELL
OVER
A
HUNDRED
MACHINES
BOTH
PC
AND
MACINTOSH
AS
WELL
AS
ADMINISTERING
A
NETWORK
OF
OVER
NEXT
MACHINES
I
PERSONALLY
AM
CONCERNED
ONLY
WITH
A
SMALL
LAB
WITH
TEN
PCS
AND
TEN
MACS
IM
NOT
THE
MANAGER
BUT
HELP
HIM
WITH
ADMIN
OFTEN
IMHO
COPYPROTECTION
SCHEMES
OF
ANY
SORT
ARE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
MAJOR
HEADACHE
FOR
THE
LEGITIMATE
USER
ANYONE
WHO
WANTS
A
COPY
OF
YOUR
PROGRAM
AND
DOESNT
CARE
ABOUT
LEGALITY
WILL
GET
A
COPY
PERIOD
PIRATE
BOARD
OR
NO
PIRATE
BOARD
I
TOO
HAVE
FRIENDS
WHO
BLATANTLY
AND
QUITE
SUCCESSFULY
HACK
COPY
PROTECTION
SCHEMES
PRACTICALLY
IN
THEIR
SLEEP
LETS
CONSIDER
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
OUR
LAB
ALMOST
DAILY
WE
HAVE
AT
LEAST
ONE
MACHINE
DOWN
SOMETIMES
SEVERAL
DUE
TO
SOME
GOOFBALL
SCREWING
UP
SOME
SETTING
OR
OTHER
ON
A
PIECE
OF
SOFTWARE
ADMITTEDLY
WE
BEING
STUDENTS
MOSTLY
ARE
NOT
THE
WORLDS
MOST
EFFICIENT
AND
EFFECTIVE
NETWORK
ADMINISTRATORS
BUT
WE
TRY
KEEPING
EVEN
THE
TWENTY
MACHINES
THAT
ARE
PARTLY
MY
RESPONSIBILITY
EVEN
VAGUELY
LOOKING
AND
ACTING
SIMILAR
TO
THE
AVERAGE
USER
AND
MAINTAINING
BEHINDTHESCENES
CONSISTENCY
IS
A
REAL
HEADACHE
BUT
NOT
SO
BAD
A
HEADACHE
AS
TRYING
TO
REMEMBER
TWENTY
DIFFERENT
FOLDER
LOCATIONS
OF
NORTON
UTILITIES
WHEN
SOME
GUY
TRASHES
HIS
DISK
OFTEN
WE
HAVE
HARDWARE
PROBLEMS
AT
PEAK
BUSINESS
TIMES
AND
HAVE
TO
DO
SOME
PARTSSWAPPING
TO
GET
STUFF
WORKING
TEMPORARILY
WELL
ILL
CUT
TO
THE
CHASE
AND
QUIT
BORING
YALL
THE
POINT
IS
OFTEN
WE
HAVE
TO
REINSTALL
SOFTWARE
AND
COPY
CONFIGURATION
FILES
ETC
FROM
MACHINE
TO
MACHINE
BY
FAR
THE
EASIEST
WAY
WE
HAVE
FOUND
TO
DO
THIS
IS
TO
GET
ONE
MACHINE
WORKING
EXACTLY
THE
WAY
WE
WANT
TO
THEN
COPY
THE
COMPLETE
SETUP
OF
THIS
MACHINE
TO
THE
OTHER
NINE
OF
THAT
MACHINES
TYPE
THIS
ENSURES
US
THAT
FOR
AT
LEAST
TEN
MINUTES
WE
HAVE
TEN
IDENTICAL
MACHINES
TO
WORK
WITH
HAVING
THEM
NETWORKED
SIMPLIFIES
THIS
CONSIDERABLY
AS
OUR
MAJOR
PACKAGES
WORDPERFECT
WINDOWS
ETC
ARE
ALL
NETWORK
VERSIONS
AND
THUS
ONLY
ONE
COPY
TO
MESS
WITH
OFTEN
HOWEVER
WE
NEED
TO
INSTALL
A
PACKAGE
REQUESTED
BY
SOME
INSTRUCTOR
TO
ONE
SOME
OR
ALL
OF
THE
MACHINES
FOR
A
SPECIAL
PROJECT
THIS
IS
USUALLY
A
HANDWRITTEN
OR
SHAREWAREETC
PROGRAM
SIMILAR
TO
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
WAS
ASKING
ABOUT
THE
FEW
WE
HAVE
HAD
WITH
COPY
PROTECTION
SCHEMES
HAVE
CAUSED
NOTHING
BUT
NIGHTMARES
FOR
US
TO
MAINTAIN
IN
SHORT
DONT
WASTE
YOUR
TIME
WITH
A
COPY
PROTECTION
SCHEME
ITS
SORT
OF
LIKE
OUTLAWING
GUNS
THE
CRIMINALS
WILL
GET
YOUR
PROGRAM
ANYWAY
AND
YOU
WILL
ONLY
BE
HURTING
THE
LEGITIMATE
HONEST
USER
WRITE
A
GOOD
USERS
GUIDE
AND
TECH
MANUAL
WHATEVER
ELSE
FOR
YOUR
PROGRAM
PLEASE
DO
THIS
REGARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
YOU
COPY
PROTECT
THE
THING
AND
ONLY
DISTRIBUTE
THE
MANUAL
TO
LICENSED
USERS
JACK
THE
PRICE
TO
CUT
YOUR
LOSSES
BUT
PLEASE
TAKE
A
CUE
FROM
THE
MAJOR
COMPANIES
WHO
CAN
ADMITTEDLY
AFFORD
THE
COSTS
OF
ILLEGAL
COPIES
FAR
BETTER
THAN
YOU
AND
DONT
BURDEN
THE
LEGITIMATE
USER
WITH
A
COPY
PROTECTION
SCHEME
SORRY
FOR
THE
TIRADE
BUT
ITS
BEEN
A
LONG
DAY

THE

DONT

NO

I
DID
NOT
SAY
THAT
THE
ORIGINALS
WOULD
ALLOW
ONLY
ONE
INSTALL
THE
USERS
CONSCIENCE
SHOULD
DO
THAT
I
KNOW
ILL
GET
FLAMED
FOR
THIS
BUT
WITH
THE
INCREASING
NUMBER
OF
CASUAL
USERS
WHO
EITHER
UNKNOWINGLY
OR
DONT
CARE
ABOUT
THE
SOFTWARE
COPYRIGHTS
ITS
THE
TRUTH
I
HAVE
FRIENDS
WHO
ASK
ME
FOR
COPIES
OF
MY
LATEST
GAMES
ALL
THE
TIME
AND
WHEN
I
REFUSED
THEY
WENT
AFTER
SOMEBODY
ELSE
CASUAL
PIRATING
IS
BECOMING
MORE
OF
A
PROBLEM
SOME
SORT
OF
COPY
PROTECTION
WILL
DISCOURAGE
THE
CASUAL
COPYING
IVE
SEEN
WHAT
SOME
OF
MY
FRIENDS
DUG
UP
SOMEWHERE
LATEST
AND
THE
GREATEST
GAMES
ALL
CRACKED
WITHIN
DAYS
OF
ACTUAL
RELEASE
YOU
KNOW
HOW
MANY
BYTES
YOU
NEED
TO
CHANGE
IN
XWING
TO
DISABLE
THE
QUIZ
TWO
YES
TWO
AND
DONT
ASK
ME
WHICH
ONES
THEY
ARE
DETERMINED
PIRATES
ARE
UNSTOPPABLE
GIVEN
ENOUGH
TIME
BUT
THEIR
RESULTS
DO
NOT
SPREAD
THAT
FAR
SINCE
PIRATE
BOARDS
ARE
NOT
THAT
WELLKNOWN
AND
EASILY
TRACKED
ONCE
FOUND
BY
AUTHORITIES
IT
IS
THE
CASUAL
PIRATES
THAT
THE
COPY
PROTECTION
IS
DETERMINED
TO
DISCOURAGE
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
THE
COMPANIES
SHOULD
DO
IS
IMPLEMENT
THE
ABOVE
PLUS
A
SPECIAL
PATCH
ONCE
THE
USER
REGISTERS
THAT
LOUDLY
EXCLAIMS
UPON
BOOTUP
REGISTERED
TO
XXXXX
ADDRESS
CITY
STATE
ZIP
AND
DISABLES
THE
ABOVE
TWO
BENEFITS
ENCOURAGES
REGISTRATION
CUTS
DOWN
ON
PIRATING
AND
MAKES
IT
MORE
TRACEABLE
BECAUSE
IF
THE
PATCHS
REGISTRATION
MESSAGE
IS
ENCRYPTED
IT
WILL
BE
QUITE
HARD
TO
CHANGE
AND
THEREFORE
PROVIDES
A
STABLE
TRAIL
OF
WHO
ALLOWED
THEIR
COPY
OUT
OF
THEIR
HANDS
AND
THUS
VIOLATED
THEIR
LICENSE
AGREEMENT
THIS
WAY
THE
LEGITIMATE
USERS
WHO
DOES
NOT
REGISTER
WILL
EXPERIENCE
MINIMAL
DISCOMFORT
WHO
DOES
MAJOR
UPGRADES
TO
THEIR
COMPUTER
FREQUENTLY
AS
ONLY
PROBLEM
THEY
HAVE
IS
THEY
WONT
BE
ABLE
TO
RESTORE
TO
ANOTHER
COMPUTER
THE
REGISTERED
USERS
WOULD
HAVE
PROVEN
THEY
ARE
LEGITMATE
USERS
AND
THEREFORE
GAINS
FULL
RIGHTS
AND
CAN
RESTORE
TO
DIFFERENT
MACHINES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
SOFTWARE
COMPANY
NOW
HAVE
A
RECORD
OF
WHERE
THIS
PARTICULAR
COPY
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
IF
THIS
USERS
COPY
WAS
FOUND
TO
BE
SOMEWHERE
IT
WAS
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
WE
KNOW
WHO
HAS
BROKEN
THEIR
LICENSE
AGREEMENT
OF
COURSE
A
HACKER
CAN
BREAK
THAT
EVENTUALLY
BUT
THATS
NOT
THE
POINT
IS
