I
DO
NOT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
ADCOM
MOBIL
AUDIO
PRODUCTS
BUT
I
DO
KNOW
FOR
A
FACT
THAT
ADCOM
DOES
NOT
MAKE
ITS
OWN
HIGH
END
HOME
AUDIO
EQUPTMENT
AND
THAT
OF
IT
COMES
DIRECTLY
OUT
OF
TIAWAN
LIKE
MOST
HIGHVOLUME
MANUFACTURERS
ADCOM
HAS
MOST
OF
ITS
PC
BOARDS
ASSEMBLED
OFFSHORE
IN
THEIR
CASE
MOSTLY
IN
THE
FAR
EAST
FINAL
ASSEMBLY
AND
TESTING
ARE
DONE
IN
EAST
BRUNSWICK
THE
PRODUCTS
ARE
AND
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
DESIGNED
ENTIRELY
IN
THE
US
BY
THEIR
OWN
STAFF
AND
BY
AUDIOPHILE
GURUS
LIKE

JUNG
ADCOM
ALSO
TENDS
TO
PREFER
AMERICAN
AND
EUROPEAN
COMPONENTS
OVER
THEIR
JAPANESEFAR
EAST
EQUIVALENTS
OFFSHORE
ASSEMBLY
IS
ONE
REASON
THAT
ADCOM
IS
ABLE
TO
MAKE
PRODUCTS
THAT
PERFORM
AS
WELL
AS
THOSE
FROM
PEOPLE
LIKE
AUDIO
RESEARCH
AND
VAN
ALSTINE
AND
BETTER
THAN
HAFLER
AND
FORTE
BUT
AT
A
MUCH
LOWER
COST
OF
COURSE
IF
YOUR
MUSICAL
DIET
CONSISTS
MOSTLY
OF

YOU
MIGHT
PREFER
COMPONENTS
FROM
