looking
for
by
mostek
hi
i
am
looking
an
integrated
circuits
for
my
computer
the
circuit
is
called
serial
timer
interrupt
and
made
by
mostek
mostek
is
called
sgs
thompson
today
i
have
been
in
contact
with
sgs
thompson
unfortunately
they
me
told
that
is
obsolete
so
my
question
is
if
anyone
know
if
i
can
get
hold
of
that
circuits
are
there
any
companies
that
specialize
in
selling
circuits
that
are
no
longer
in
production
i
have
contacted
several
electronic
brokers
in
sweden
but
without
any
success
i
would
appreciate
if
you
could
give
me
hint
where
i
should
continue
looking
even
companies
in
the
united
states
would
be
fine
since
this
circuit
is
pretty
crucial
to
me
thanks
in
advance
