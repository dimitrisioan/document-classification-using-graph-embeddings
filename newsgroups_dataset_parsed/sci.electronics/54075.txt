FOR
MY
COMPUTER
THE

CALLED
SERIAL
TIMER
INTERRUPT
AND
MADE
BY
MOSTEK
MOSTEK

CALLED
SGS
THOMPSON
TODAY
I
HAVE
BEEN
IN
CONTACT
WITH
SGS
THOMPSON
UNFORTUNATELY
THEY
ME
TOLD
THAT

OBSOLETE
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
IF
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
I
CAN
GET
HOLD
OF
THAT
CIRCUITS
ARE
THERE
ANY
COMPANIES
THAT
SPECIALIZE
IN
SELLING
CIRCUITS
THAT
ARE
NO
LONGER
IN
PRODUCTION
I
HAVE
CONTACTED
SEVERAL
ELECTRONIC
BROKERS
IN
SWEDEN
BUT
WITHOUT
ANY
SUCCESS
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
IF
YOU
COULD
GIVE
ME
HINT
WHERE
I
SHOULD
CONTINUE
LOOKING
EVEN
COMPANIES
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
WOULD
BE
FINE
SINCE
THIS
CIRCUIT
IS
PRETTY
CRUCIAL
TO
ME
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
