HOW
TO
KILL
AC
INDUCTIVE
LOAD
SPIKING
IS
THERE
A
FAST
N
DIRTY
WAY
TO
KILL
THE
LINE
SPIKING
THAT
OCCURS
WHEN
AN
INDUCTIVE
LOAD
IS
TURNED
ON
SOMETIME
OTHER
THAN
AT
ZEROCROSSING
OF
THE
AC
CYCLE
A
CAPACITOR
KLUDGED
IN
SOMEHOW
ETC
IVE
GOT
A
MICROCONTROLLER
THAT
IS
RUNNING
A
BUNCH
OF
VALVES
AND
PUMPS
IN
A
BIG
INSTRUMENT
WASHER
AND
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
IS
BEING
SWITCHED
WITH
ZEROCROSSING
SOLID
STATE
RELAYS
SO
THAT
STUFF
STAYS
QUIET
ACWISE
BUT
THERES
ONE
STEAM
VALVE
THAT
GETS
TURNED
ON
BY
A
MECHANICAL
RELAY
IN
THE
WATER
TANK
FILLTHERMOSTAT
SYSTEM
AND
ITS
NOT
UNDER
CONTROL
OF
MY
SSRS
AND
IT
DOES
SOMETIMES
GENERATERADIATE
A
SPIKE
THAT
RESETS
ONE
OF
MY
PERIPHERAL
CHIPS
MY
SOFTWARE
TIMES
OUT
AND
TRIES
AGAIN
BUT
ID
LOVE
TO
JUST
TACK
IN
A
MAGIC
SPIKEKILLING
FIX
THAT
WOULD
AVOID
HAVING
TO
DO
SOME
MAJOR
REWIRINGREDESIGN
A
VARISTOR
WOULD
HELP
BUT
MIGHT
NOT
BE
SUFFICIENT
IDEAS
