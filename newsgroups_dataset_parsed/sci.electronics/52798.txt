how
to
kill
ac
inductive
load
spiking
is
there
a
fast
n
dirty
way
to
kill
the
line
spiking
that
occurs
when
an
inductive
load
is
turned
on
sometime
other
than
at
zerocrossing
of
the
ac
cycle
a
capacitor
kludged
in
somehow
etc
ive
got
a
microcontroller
that
is
running
a
bunch
of
valves
and
pumps
in
a
big
instrument
washer
and
almost
everything
is
being
switched
with
zerocrossing
solid
state
relays
so
that
stuff
stays
quiet
acwise
but
theres
one
steam
valve
that
gets
turned
on
by
a
mechanical
relay
in
the
water
tank
fillthermostat
system
and
its
not
under
control
of
my
ssrs
and
it
does
sometimes
generateradiate
a
spike
that
resets
one
of
my
peripheral
chips
my
software
times
out
and
tries
again
but
id
love
to
just
tack
in
a
magic
spikekilling
fix
that
would
avoid
having
to
do
some
major
rewiringredesign
a
varistor
would
help
but
might
not
be
sufficient
