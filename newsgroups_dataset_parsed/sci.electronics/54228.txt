CALENDAR
WRITES
IM
WONDERING
IF
I
CAN
TOTE
MY
AMERICAN
TOUCH
TONE
PHONE
AROUND
WITH
ME
TO
SWEDEN
AND
GERMANY
ITS
DC
POWERED
AND
I
CAN
BUY
A
SPECIAL
ADAPTER
FOR
THAT
IN
EUROPE
THE
QUESTION
IS
IF
THE
GENERAL
ELECTRONICS
WORK
THE
SAME
I
CAN
BUY
A
DIFFERENT
WALL
PLUG
AND
REFIT
IT
IM
SURE
ID
HAVE
TO
BUT
WOULD
THAT
DO
THE
TRICK
TWO
THINGS
TO
WATCH
FOR
IN
GERMANY
AND
I
THINK
THE
SAME
HOLDS
FOR
SWEDEN
ONLY
SOME
OF
THE
CONNECTIONS
CAN
HANDLE
TONE
DIALING
SO
MAKE
SURE
THE
PHONE
CAN
BE
SET
TO
PULSE
DIALING
IN
SWEDEN
THE
IS
THE
FIRST
DIGIT
AND
ALL
OTHER
DIGITS
ARE
PUSHED
DOWN
BY
ONE
POSITION
THIS
MAKES
DIALING
AND
IN
THE
PROCESS
CONVERTING
NUMBERS
AN
INTERESTING
TASK
THIS
IS
JUST
BASICLY
RIGHT
THE
CONNECTIONS
THAT
CANNOT
HANDLE
TOUCHTONE
DIALING
IS
VERY
FEW
I
WOULD
ESTIMATE
A
COUPLE
OF
PERCENTS
AND
IF
YOU
ARE
IN
A
BIGGER
TOWN
THERE
IS
NONE
THAT
CANNOT
HANDLE
TONE
DIALING
AND
REGARDING
OUR
SWEDISH
DIALING
SYSTEM
A
RATHER
SCREWD
UP
SYSTEM
THAT
DOES
JUST
APPLY
TO
PULSDIALING
NOT
TO
TOUCHTONE
BTW
NORWAY
IS
EVEN
MORE
INTERESTING
THEY
GOT
BOTH
SYSTEM
SO
YOU
NEED
DIFFERENT
PHONES
DEPENDING
ON
WHERE
IN
THE
COUNTRY
YOU
LIVE
