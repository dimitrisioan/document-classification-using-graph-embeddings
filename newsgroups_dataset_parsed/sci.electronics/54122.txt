of
those
food
dehydrators
ive
been
seeing
all
over
latenight
tv
recently
i
was
wondering
if
they
use
forced
air
heat
or
both
if
theres
heat
involved
anybody
know
what
temperature
they
run
at
my
wife

like
one
and
im
not
inclined
to
pay
for
a
box
a
fan
and
a
heater
seems
to
me
you
should
be
able
to
throw
a
dehydrator
together
for
just
a
few
bucks

technology
is
only
