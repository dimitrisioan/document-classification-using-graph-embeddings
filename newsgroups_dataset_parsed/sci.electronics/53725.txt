i
was
also
sceptical
about
the
amps
being
built
in
the
fareast
or
whereever
but
if
you
look
in
the
amp
and
see
what
components
they
use
and
how
it
was
designed
you
can
easily
see
why
the
amplifiers
sound
so
brilliant
good
pointalso
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
that
the
components
they
use
offshore
are
of
inferior
quality
as
long
as
it
was
properly
designed
and
robust
premium
components
are
used
it
shouldnt
matter
where
it
is
assembled
definately
i
agree
wholeheartedly
if
they
can
build
the
amp
where
the
labour
is
not
so
expensive
they
can
afford
to
put
decent
components
in
and
go
to
more
effort
to
improve
the
design
of
the
amplifier
as
adcom
has
done
i
cannot
see
why
people
say
the
amplifier
wont
last
not
with
those
quality
components
inside
sure
the
amp
runs
very
fairly
hot
but
thats
how
you
get
an
amp
to
sound
incredibly
good
an
amp
that
runs
hot
has
no
bearing
on
how
its
gonna
sound
the
amp
you
have
probably
is
running
classa
the
whole
day
actually
id
be
wary
of
excessively
hot
amps
cauz
even
though
the
components
inside
may
be
rated
to
run
that
way
excessive
heat
will
dramatically
shorten
the
life
of
any
electronic
component
regardless
of
quality
in
fact
an
amp
that
does
run
hot
to
the
touch
is
because
either
the
engineer
or
manufacturer
of
that
amp
wanted
to
skimp
on
heatsinking
or
cooling
to
save
costs
hmmmmm
sure
i
didnt
mean
to
imply
that
because
of
the
heat
generated
the
amp
sounds
good
my
adcom
gfp
runs
fairly
warm
not
hot
to
the
touch
but
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
the
amp
is
running
nicely
i
dont
like
it
when
an
amp
runs
deadcold
it
makes
one
think
that
the
amp
is
doing
nothing
the
heatsinks
that
adcom
uses
in
their
amps
are
certainly
far
for
skimpy
theyre
massive
things
with
heating
vents
both
below
and
above
more
than
enough
to
carry
away
excessive
heat
my
opinions
once
again
alan
webber
the
path
you
tread
is
narrow
and
the
drop
is
sheer
and
very
high
the
ravens
all
are
watching
from
a
vantage
point
near
by
apprehension
creeping
like
a
chootrain
up
your
spine
will
the
tightrope
reach
the
end

final
