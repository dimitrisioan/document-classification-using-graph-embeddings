asked
this
a
year
ago
but
i
am
still
looking
i
am
getting
sick
of
having
to
use
a
or
a
check
out
xicors
new
goodie
in
the
april
edition
of
eetimes
an
with
built
in
latch
and
bootloader
setup
you
hook
it
directly
to
your
power
it
up
the
prom
initialises
the
serial
port
on
the
you
load
in
your
code
via
rxd
this
gets
blatted
onto
the
then
you
reset
and
run
im
sure
dallas
also
does
something
like
this
too
i
suppose
it
would
boil
down

relative
prices
and
the
dallas
part
freeing
up
completely
i
wonder
if
anyone
has
ever
managed
to
design
a
single

pcb
with
an
eprom
