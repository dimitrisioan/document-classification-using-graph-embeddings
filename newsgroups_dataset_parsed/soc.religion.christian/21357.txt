you
might
visit
some
congregations
of
christians
who
happen
to
be
homosexuals
that
are
spiritfilled
believers
gifts
of
the
spirit
should
not
be
seen
as
an
endorsement
of
ones
behavior
a
lot
of
people
have
suffered
because
of
similar
beliefs
jesus
said
that
people
would
come
to
him
saying
lord
lord
and
proclaiming
the
miraculous
works
they
had
done
in
his
name
jesus
would
tell
them
that
they
were
workers
of
iniquity
that
do
not
know
him
and
to
depart
from
him
that
is
not
to
say
that
this
will
happen
to
everyone
who
commits
a
homosexual
sin
if
the
holy
spirit
were
only
given
to
the
morally
perfect
he
would
not
be
given
to
me
or
any
of
us
god
can
forgive
any
sin
if
we
repent
but
people
should
be
careful
not
to
think
god
has
given
me
a
gift
of
the
spirit
it
must
be
okay
to
be
gay
that
is
dangerous
see
also
hebrews
about
those
who
have
partaken
of
the
holy
spirit
and
of
the
powers
of
the
world
to
come
the
lord
is
working
in
our
community
the
homosexual
community
that
is
hes
not
asking
us
to
change
our
sexual
nature
jesus
doesnt
ask
us
to
change
our
own
nature
we
cannot
lift
ourselves
out
of
our
own
sin
but
we
must
submit
to
his
hand
as
he
changes
our
nature
practicing
homosexual
acts
and
homosexual
lusts
violates
the
morality
that
god
has
set
forth
if
you
dont
believe
that
and
think
those
of
us
who
do
are
just
ignorant
then
at
least
consider
us
weak
in
the
faith
and
be
celebate
for
our
sakes
is
practicing
homosexuality
worth
the
cost
of
a
soul
whether
it
be
the
homosexuals
or
the
one
considered
ignorant
