re
homosexuality
issues
in
christiani
the
cited
passages
are
covered
in
depth
in
a
faq
for
this
group
that
particular
faq
ive
forgotten
the
author
discusses
the
traditional
vs
prohomosexual
interpretations
of
the
passages
and
indicates
which
points
have
strong
textual
support
perhaps
the
moderator
might
give
again
the
instructions
for
retrieving
the
faq
on
this
topic
btw
this
issue
while
dealt
with
before
is
very
timely
one
of
the
major
presbyterian
churches
in
california
st
andrews
a
megachurch
in
a
rich
neighborhood
is
withholding
their
support
of
synod
amounts
to
about
of
the
budget
of
the
synod
which
covers
all
of
southern
ca
and
hawaii
until
support
for
a
prohomosexual
lobbying
group
the
lazarus
project
is
terminated
this
came
from
a
news
report
on
cnn
yesterday
corrections
welcome
tim
i
think
its
time
for
me
to
post
the
faq
this
is
an
issue
throughout
the
presbyterian
church
on
the
other
side
one
of
the
major
churches
in
cincinnati
has
been
ordaining
homosexual
elders
and
has
ignored
presbytery
instructions
not
to
do
so
and
the
church
in
rochester
where
the
judicial
commission
said
they
couldnt
install
a
homosexual
pastor
has
made
her
an
evangelist
these
situations
as
well
as
the
one
you
describe
do
not
appear
to
be
stable
this
will
certainly
be
a
major
topic
for
the
general
assembly
next
month
if
the
church
cant
come
up
with
a
solution
that
will
let
people
live
with
each
other
i
think
were
end
up
with
a
split
clearly
neither
side
wants
that
but
i
think
well
get
pushed
into
it
by
actions
of
both
sides
