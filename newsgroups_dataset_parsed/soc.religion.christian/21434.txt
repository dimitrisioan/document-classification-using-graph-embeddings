today
might
be
the
masons
just
a
note
that
they
too
worshipped
osiris
in
egypt

it
bugs
me
when
i
see
this
kind
of
nonsense
first
there
is
no
reasonable
evidence
linking
masonry
to
ancient
egypt
or
even
that
it
existed
prior
to
the
late
century
and
theres
nothing
definitive
before
the
second
worship
of
osiris
is
not
nor
has
it
ever
been
a
part
of
masonic
practice
we
are
strictly
nondenominational
tangents
never
ending
tangents
