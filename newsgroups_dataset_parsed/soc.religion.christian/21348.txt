RE
QUESTION
ABOUT
VIRGIN
MARY
AS
THE
MODERATOR
NOTED
I
THINK
YOU
MEAN
THE
ASSUMPTION
CATHOLICS
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BLESSED
VIRGIN
MARY
WENT
TO
HEAVEN
BODY
AND
SOUL
AT
THE
END
OF
HER
LIFE
THIS
IS
UNUSUAL
BECAUSE
THE
NORMAL
COURSE
OF
EVENTS
IS
FOR
YOUR
BODY
TO
DECAY
IN
THE
GRAVE
AND
STAY
THAT
WAY
UNTIL
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
WELL
IT
WASNT
THAT
WAY
FOR
ENOCH
AND
ELIJAH
BOTH
OF
WHOM
WERE
TRANSLATED
DIRECTLY
INTO
HEAVEN
ITS
BEYOND
MY
GRASP
WHY
SOME
OBJECT
THAT
MARY
WHO
WAS
FAR
GREATER
THAN
EITHER
ENOCH
OR
ELIJAH
SHOULD
NOT
BENEFIT
FROM
THE
SAME
PRIVELEGE
THEY
RECIEVED
SHE
WAS
AFTER
ALL
MOTHER
OF
GOD
FULL
OF
GRACE
AND
IMMACULATE
HISTORICALLY
BELIEF
IN
THE
ASSUMPTION
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
THE
WRITINGS
OF
ST
GREGORY
OF
TOURS
LATE
CENTURY
AND
IN
ST
GERMAIN
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
AND
ST
JOHN
OF
DAMASCUS
AND
IN
ST
ANDREW
OF
CRETE
AMONG
OTHERS
AND
IT
SHOULD
BE
NOTED
THAT
THE
MONOPHYSITE
CHRUCHES
OF
EGYPT
AND
SYRIA
ALSO
HOLD
TO
THIS
BELIEF
AS
PART
OF
DIVINE
REVELATION
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
BROKE
AWAY
FROM
THE
UNITY
OF
THE
CHRUCH
IN
AD
BY
REJECTING
THE
COUNCIL
OF
CHALCEDON
IT
MIGHT
BE
ARGUED
BY
SOME
PROTESTANTS
THAT
THE
CATHOLICS
AND
ORTHODOX
MADE
THIS
BELIEF
UP
BUT
THE
MONOPHYSITES
PUT
A
BIG
HOLE
IN
THAT
NOTION
AS
THEY
ALSO
HOLD
THE
BELIEF
AND
THEY
SPLIT
FROM
THE
CHRUCH
BEFORE
THE
BELIEF
WAS
FIRST
ANNUNCIATED
IN
WRITING
AS
FAR
AS
IS
KNOWN
MUCH
HAS
BEEN
LOST
FROM
THE
TIME
OF
THE
FATHERS
