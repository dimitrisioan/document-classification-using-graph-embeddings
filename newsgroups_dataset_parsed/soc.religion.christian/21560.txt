dreams
and
oobes
are
totally
mental
phenomena
in
this
case
no
morality
dreams
and
oobes
have
a
reality
of
their
own
ie
are
another
plane
like
but
here
we
assume
that
though
the
dreeam
and
oobe
environs
have
a
real
existence
a
different
moralethics
apply
there
and
no
or
maybe
different
moral
laws
apply
there
i
can
think
of
another
alternative
oobes
are
a
form
of
contact
with
the
demonic
world
whereby
one
intentionally
or
unintentionally
surrenders
control
of
his
or
her
perceptions
to
spiritual
beings
whose
purpose
is
to
deceive
and
entrap
them
