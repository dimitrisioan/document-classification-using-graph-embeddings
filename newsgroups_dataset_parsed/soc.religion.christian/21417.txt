RE
HOW
I
GOT
SAVED
WELL
I
WAS
CERTAINLY
TURNED
OFF
BY
THAT
FIRST
PARAGRAPH
OF
OFTUSED
PLATITUDES
I
CANT
COUNT
THE
TIMES
IVE
HEARD
THOSE
COMMON
TACTICS
ANYMOREYOU
MAY
NOT
BELIEVE
IT
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
CHANGE
THE
FACT
THAT
ITS
TRUETHE
OLD
ANALOGY
ABOUT
TRUSTING
YOUR
PARENTSSHEESH
NEED
I
POINT
OUT
HOW
PARENTS
CAN
SHOW
CHILDREN
THAT
THEY
ARE
RIGHT
THAT
DIFFERENCE
IN
CAPABILITY
ALONE
CRUSHES
THAT
ANALOGY
AS
ANY
FACTS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
I
HAVE
SEEN
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
BELIEFS
WHAT
I
SEEK
IS
FACTKNOWLEDGEIF
I
CAN
GET
IT
AND
EVIDENCE
FOR
A
BELIEF
IF
I
CANT
SO
FAR
FROM
CHRISTIANS
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
NEITHER
BEFORE
BECOMING
A
CHRISTIAN
I
TOO
HAD
PROBLEMS
WHEN
I
ASKED
ONE
TO
EXPLAIN
IT
TO
METHE
ACTUAL
EVIDENCE
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
WHAT
YOU
SEE
ON
A
PERSONS
OUTSIDE
IT
SHOULD
BE
BUT
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
A
VERY
SPECIFIC
SOMEWHAT
MIRACULOUS
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
TRUTH
OF
GOD
WORKING
TO
HELP
HIS
FOLLOWERS
IS
SOEMTHING
THAT
HAPPENED
TO
ME
FOR
NEARLY
YEARS
AFTER
AN
ACCIDENT
I
HAD
SEVERE
COMPLICATIONS
FROM
A
TRIPLE
FRACTURE
IN
MY
LEFT
LEG
AND
SURGERYPINS
PUT
IN
THEN
REMOVED
THE
BONE
ITSELF
WAS
PERFECTLY
HEALED
NO
INFECTOIN
THAT
COULD
BE
DETECTED
YET
I
WAS
IN
CONSTANT
PAIN
AND
IT
MY
ANKLE
AND
FOOT
WERE
ALWAYS
SWOLLEN
AND
BLUISH
MORE
COMPLICATIOS
DEVELOPED
IN
MY
OTHER
LEG
NONE
OF
WHICH
COULD
BE
EXPLAINED
BY
THE
BEST
SPECIALISTS
AND
MOST
SOPHISTICATED
TESTS
IN
TE
NORTHERN
ILLINOIS
REGION
WE
WENT
EVERYWHERENO
ONE
COULD
EXPLAIN
IT
DURIN
GTHAT
SUMMER
JUNE
TO
BE
EXACT
I
GAVE
MY
LIFE
AND
HEART
TO
CHRIST
AND
VOWED
TO
RELINQUISH
CONTROL
OVER
MY
LIFE
WHICH
I
NEVER
REALLY
HAD
ANYWAY
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
HE
DID
FOR
ME
ON
THE
CROSS
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
MY
WHOLE
LIFE
WAS
SCREWED
UP
BY
ME
TRYING
TO
FIX
IT
I
WAS
FACING
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
LIFETIME
IN
A
WHEELCHAIR
I
WAS
CONFINED
TO
ONE
IN
ORDER
TO
SAVE
MY
LEGS
FROM
ANY
FURTHER
DAMAGE
SINCE
THE
CAUSE
OF
MY
PROBLEMS
WERE
UNKNOWN
HAD
BEEN
IN
IT
FOR
ABOUT
MONTHS
BEFORE
THAT
DAY
I
FOUND
IT
ORE
THAN
COINCIDENTAL
THAT
LESS
THAN
WEEKS
AFTER
I
PUT
MY
FAITH
WHERE
MY
MOUTH
WAS
ONE
MORE
IN
THE
LONG
LINE
OF
DOCTORS
AND
NOT
EVEN
AN
ORTHOPEODIC
SPECIALIST
DIAGNOSED
MY
PROBLEMS
WITH
NO
DIFFICULTY
SET
ME
ON
THE
PATH
TO
AN
EFFECTIVE
CURE
AND
I
WAS
WALKING
AND
RUNNING
AGAIN
WITHOUT
THE
PAIN
THAT
HAD
STOPPED
ME
FROM
THAT
FOR
YEARS
THE
DIAGNOSIS
WAS
SOMETHING
HE
FELT
THE
OTHER
DOCTORS
MUST
HAVE
OVERLOOKED
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
PERFECTLY
OBVIOUS
FROM
MY
TEST
RESULTS
MAYBE
THIS
DOESNT
HIT
YOU
AS
MIRACULOUS
BUT
TO
ME
IT
REALLY
IS
IMAGINE
AN
ACTIVE
YEAR
OLD
BEING
TOLD
SHE
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
WALK
MCUH
LONGERAND
IS
NOW
A
HAPPY
YEAR
OLD
WHO
CAN
DANCE
AND
RUN
KNOWING
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THERE
ALL
ALONG
AND
WAS
REVEALED
JUST
AFTER
SHE
DID
WHAT
SHE
KNEW
WAS
RIGHT
AS
THE
SONG
SAYS
OUR
GOD
IS
AN
AWESOME
GOD
