YOUR

OR
AFTER
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
CORRECT
THE
TYPO
IN
THE

KINSEY
SEE
BELOW
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
FIGURE
PERCENT
HE
DEFINES
SEXUALITY
BY
BEHAVIOR
NOT
BY
ORIENTATION
AND
RANKED
ALL
PERSONS
ON
A
SCALE
FROM
ZERO
COMPLETELY
HETEROSEXUAL
TO
COMPLETELY
HETEROSEXUAL
IT
SEEMS
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
END
OF
THE
RATING
SCALE
SHOULD
BE
IDENTIFIED
WITH
HOMOSEXUAL
AS
A
PERSONAL
NOTE
I
GUESS
I
DIFFER
WITH
YOU
ON
THE
QUESTION
OF
WORK
ENTERING
HUMAN
LIFE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SIN
NOTE
THAT
IN
THE
CREATION
STORY
WORK
ENTERS
HUMAN
LIFE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SIN
BEFORE
THE
FALL
GEN
AND
THE
LORD
GOD
TOOK
THE
MAN
AND
PUT
HIM
INTO
THE
GARDEN
OF
EDEN
TO
DRESS
IT
AND
TO
KEEP
IT
WHICH
I
WOULD
CALL
WORK
FOR
ME
THE
DIFFERENCE
INTRODUCED
BY
SIN
IS
THE
PAINFUL
ASPECTS
OF
WORK
ADDED
AT
THE
FALL
I
TAKE
THE
CURSING
OF
THE
GROUND
IN
TO
APPLY
TO
THE
WORK
FOR
SUSTENANCE
IN
A
WAY
SOME
VIEW
WORK
AS
A
BLESSING
ECCLESIASTES
IS
A
FUN
BOOK
FOR
MELANCHOLIES
I
HOPE
I
DO
NOT
SOUND
CAUSTIC
MAYBE
YOU
CAN
ENLIGHTEN
ME
FURTHER
WELL
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
A
DELICATE
SUBJECT
AND
I
GUESS
YOU
ACCOMPLISHED
WHAT
YOU
STATE
AS
YOUR
PURPOSE
IT
SUMMARIZES
ARGUMENTS
FOR
ALLOWING
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
NOT
FOR
ME
THE
MOST
NOBLE
GOAL
BUT
YOU
ARE
WRITING
A
FAQ
I
WONDER
IF
YOU
MIGHT
TEMPORIZE
THE
APPARENT
SENTENCE
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
HOMOSEXUAL
YOU
PROPOSE
ARGUABLY
TENUOUSLY
DEFINE
THE
DANGER
IN
ADVISING
CHRISTIANS
TO
DEPEND
UPON
SUCH
A
CHANGE
IS
CLEAR
WHEN
CONVERSION
DOESNT
HAPPEN
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
OFTEN
LEFT
IN
DESPAIR
FEELING
EXCLUDED
FROM
A
CHURCH
THAT
HAS
NOTHING
MORE
TO
SAY
BUT
A
REQUIREMENT
OF
LIFELONG
CELIBACY
PERHAPS
THAT
WOULD
BE
TRUE
OF
CELIBACY
FROM
HOMOSEXUAL
RELATIONS
OR
REFRAINNG
FROM
THEIR
CHOICE
RELATIONSHIPS
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
FORBID
HETEROSEXUAL
COULD
THEY
NOT
HAVEENJOY
HETEROSEXUAL
RELATIONS
FOR
WHAT
IT
WAS
WORTH
THIS
DEPENDS
UPON
THE
PERSON
IN
SOME
CASES
I
THINK
THE
ANSWER
IS
NO
EVEN
WITH
THOSE
WHO
COULD
CONSIDER
WHAT
YOURE
ASKING
I
ASSUME
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
MARRIAGE
I
CERTAINLY
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
SUGGEST
SEX
OUTSIDE
THAT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
A
PERMANENT
COMMITMENT
TO
A
KIND
OF
SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIP
THAT
THEY
ARENT
REALLY
SURE
THEY
CAN
LIVE
WITH
THERE
MAY
BE
PEOPLE
FOR
WHOM
THIS
IS
A
POSSIBLE
SOLUTION
BUT
I
WONDER
WHETHER
ITS
ENTIRELY
FAIR
TO
THE
OTHER
PARTNER
I
HAVE
A
COUSIN
WHO
WAS
A
VICTIM
OF
EXACTLY
THIS
SITUATION
WE
FOUND
OUT
LATER
AFTER
HER
DEATH
THAT
HER
HUSBAND
HAD
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
HIS
SEXUAL
IDENTITY
HIS
FAMILY
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
KNEW
IT
AND
PUSHED
HIM
INTO
GETTING
MARRIED
HE
CONTINUED
HAVING
PROBLEMS
AND
THEY
WERE
NEAR
DIVORCE
SHE
DIED
IN
AN
ACCIDENT
WHOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES
SOME
OF
THE
RELATIVES
CONSIDER
ODD
HE
HAS
SINCE
HAD
A
SEX
CHANGE
OPERATION
AND
HAS
BEEN
MOVING
AROUND
FROM
STATE
TO
STATE
WITHOUT
BEING
ABLE
TO
HOLD
A
JOB
KEEPING
THEIR
CHILDREN
IN
A
KIND
OF
HOME
LIFE
BOTH
SETS
OF
GRANDPARENTS
CONSIDER
IRRESPONSIBLE
I
HOPE
YOU
CAN
UNDERSTAND
WHY
I
AM
NOT
ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT
PUSHING
HOMOSEXUALS
INTO
MARRIAGE
I
REALLY
LIKED
MY
COUSIN
THIS
IS
SORT
OF
AN
EMOTIONAL
ISSUE
FOR
ME
AGAIN
IT
MAY
BE
POSSIBLE
FOR
SOME
BUT
THIS
IS
THE
SORT
OF
SITUATION
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
DEALT
WITH
PASTORALLY
AND
NOT
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FIXED
IDEOLOGY
