WRITES
IN
LOOKING
THROUGH
MY
FILES
THIS
WEEKEND
I
RAN
ACROSS
SOME
LYRICS
FROM
VARIOUS
ROCK
GROUPS
THAT
HAVE
CONTENT
HERE
ARE
TWO
FROM
BLACK
SABBATHS
MASTER
OF
REALITY
ILL
SAY
THIS
MUCH
FOR
THE
MUSIC
OF
THE
AND
EARLY
AT
LEAST
THEY
ASKED
QUESTIONS
OF
SIGNIFICANCE
JETHRO
TULL
IS
ANOTHER
TO
ASKED
AND
WROTE
ABOUT
THINGS
THAT
CAUSED
ONE
TO
WONDER
REX
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THAT
YOU
POSTED
THOSE
LYRICS
BECAUSE
JUST
THE
OTHER
DAY
I
WAS
THINKING
OF
DOING
THE
SAME
I
LIKE
THOSE
LYRICS
SINCE
WHENEVER
I
AM
APPROACHED
BY
JUDGEMENTAL
PHARISITICAL
EVANGELICAL
FUNDAMENTALISTS
WHO
THROW
THE
BIBLE
AT
ME
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
LONG
HAIR
WEAR
A
BLACK
LEATHER
JACKET
AND
LISTEN
TO
BLACK
SABBATH
I
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
THROW
BACK
USUALLY
THEIR
CHINS
DROP
AND
THEY
COME
UP
SPEECHLESS
OVER
THOSE
NOT
VERY
SATANIC
LYRICS
IT
JUST
GOES
TO
SHOW
THAT
THERE
ARE
MORE
IMPORTANT
EVILS
IN
THE
WORLD
TO
BATTLE
THAN
ROCK
LYRICS
STEVEN
C
SALARIS
WEREA
LOT
MORE
DANGEROUS
THAN
LIVE
CREW
AND
THEIR
STUPID
USE
OF
FOUL
LANGUAGE
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
IDEAS
WE
HAVE
A
PHILOSOPHY
