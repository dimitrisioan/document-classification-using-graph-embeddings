QUESTION
ABOUT
HELL
WHAT
IS
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
IDEA
OF
HELL
BEING
A
PLACE
OF
ETERNAL
SUFFERING
IF
IT
IS
BIBLICAL
PLEASE
REFERENCE
HERES
MY
TRAIN
OF
THOUGHT
IF
GOD
IS
USING
THE
EARTH
TO
MANUFACTURE
HEAVENLY
BEINGS
THEN
IT
IS
LOGICAL
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
A
CERTAIN
YIELD
AND
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
WASTE
THE
YIELD
GOES
TO
HEAVEN
AND
THE
WASTE
IS
BURNED
DESTROYED
IN
HELL
WHY
IS
IT
NECESSARY
TO
PUNISH
THE
WASTE
RATHER
THAN
JUST
DESTROY
IT
PEACE
AND
JOY
