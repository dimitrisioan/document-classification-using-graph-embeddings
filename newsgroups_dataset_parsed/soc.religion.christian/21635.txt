I
DO
NEED
YOU
TO
SHOW
ME
THAT
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
A
SPIRITUAL
NEED
TO
DO
THAT
IT
MAY
BE
NECESSARY
TO
SHOW
ME
THAT
SPIRITS
SOULS
WHATNOT
EXIST
GOD
IS
NOT
IMPORTANT
TO
THAT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
I
GET
THE
FEELING
THAT
WE
ARE
DEBATING
AT
CROSSPURPOSESTHAT
WE
DO
NOT
SEE
THE
SAME
FUNDAMENTAL
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
THIS
PERHAPS
MAKES
MY
ANSWERS
ORTHOGONAL
TO
YOUR
QUESTIONS
I
WILL
TRY
AGAIN
PERHAPS
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
NOTHING
EXISTS
ASIDE
FROM
OBJECTIVELY
OBSERVABLE
AND
PROVABLE
THINGS
IN
THAT
CASE
I
CANNOT
SHOW
YOU
THAT
THERE
IS
SUCH
THING
AS
A
SPIRIT
OR
A
SPIRITUAL
NEEDTHESE
THINGS
DO
NOT
EXIST
IN
THE
REALM
OF
THE
OBJECTIVE
BUT
IN
THE
REALM
OF
THE
SUBJECTIVE
OTOH
IF
YOU
WISH
YOU
CAN
SIMPLY
BUT
EXPLICITLY
PLEASE
ASSUME
SPIRITS
EXIST
AND
THEN
SHOW
ME
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
NEEDS
AND
THAT
AA
HANDLES
THESE
NEEDS
IN
SOME
WAY
YOU
CAN
ASSUME
GOD
EXISTS
TOO
IF
THAT
WILL
HELP
ILL
PLAY
ALONG
BY
AA
I
ASSUME
YOU
MEAN
ALCOHOLICS
ANONYMOUS
AND
NOT
ALTATHEISM
I
WOULD
NOT
SAY
THAT
AA
HANDLES
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
RATHER
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
AA
AND
OTHER
PROGRAMS
HELP
PEOPLE
COME
TO
TERMS
WITH
THEIR
NEEDSIE
THAT
AA
IS
FACILITATING
THE
RECOVERY
AND
THAT
AS
PART
OF
THE
RECOVERY
THEY
RECOGNIZE
THEIR
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
AND
BEGIN
TO
RELY
ON
A
HIGHER
POWER
TERM
TO
FILL
THEM
INSTEAD
OF
WHATEVER
SUBSTANCE
ABUSE
THEY
HAD
BEEN
ACCUSTOMED
TO
SORRY
THERE
IS
NO
OBJECTIVE
PROOF
HERE
EITHERNO
WAY
TO
TAKE
IDENTICAL
ALCOHOLICS
AND
TRY
TO
HAVE
ONE
RECOVER
BY
FULFILLING
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
AND
ONE
WITHOUT
AND
EXTERNALLY
COMPARE
THE
DIFFERENCEWE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
VIRTUALLY
INFINITE
COMPLEXITY
OF
PEOPLE
HERE
BUT
I
SHOULD
SAY
IF
GOD
IS
A
NECESSARY
COMPONENT
OF
YOUR
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
THEN
I
TRUELY
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
AT
ALL
IT
SOUNDS
TO
ME
LIKE
SPIRITS
HAVE
NEEDS
THAT
SHOULD
BE
FULFILLED
BY
GOD
BUT
CAN
BE
MASKED
IN
OTHER
WAYS
DRUGS
ETC
IF
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
THEN
YOU
CAN
LEAVE
OUT
GOD
JUST
DESCRIBE
THE
PROBLEM
NOT
THE
SOLUTION
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
COULD
BE
DEFINED
AS
THINGS
THAT
PEOPLE
NEED
IN
ADDITION
TO
PHYSICAL
REQUIREMENTS
LIKE
AIR
FOOD
SLEEP
ETC
THESE
ARE
THINGS
LIKE
THE
NEED
FOR
LOVE
AND
ACCEPTANCE
AND
THE
NEED
FOR
MEANING
IN
LIFE
IF
ONE
DENIES
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SPIRITUAL
THINGS
ONE
WOULD
PRESUMABLY
CALL
THESE
EMOTIONAL
NEEDS
THE
REASON
CHRISTIANS
CALL
THEM
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
IS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
ASPECTS
THAT
ARE
NOT
FULFILLABLE
EXCEPT
BY
SPIRITUAL
MEANSIE
A
PERSON
COULD
BE
LOVED
AND
ACCEPTED
BY
MANY
PEOPLE
AND
DO
MANY
MEANINGFUL
THINGS
BUT
STILL
HAVE
A
NEED
FOR
LOVE
WHICH
CAN
ONLY
BE
SATISFIED
BY
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
NOW
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
ACCEPT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THESE
NEEDS
AND
PEOPLE
WHO
REJECT
THEM
SINCE
I
BELIEVE
IN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
SOME
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
RIGHT
AND
THE
OTHERS
ARE
WRONG
SO
HERE
ARE
THE
POSSIBILITIES
IF
CHRISTIANS
ARE
RIGHT
THEN
WE
ALL
HAVE
SPIRITUAL
NEEDSIE
WE
ALL
NEED
GOD
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
REALIZE
THAT
THEY
NEED
GOD
ARE
DELUDEDTHEY
JUST
HAVENT
RECOGNIZED
IT
YET
IF
CHRISTIANS
ARE
WRONG
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
ARE
AN
ARTEFACT
OF
OUR
BRAIN
CHEMICALS
WELLADJUSTED
AND
PROPERLYINTEGRATED
PERSONALITIES
DO
NOT
HAVE
SUCH
THINGS
CHRISTIANS
ARE
SIMPLY
USING
THE
CONCEPT
OF
GOD
AND
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
TO
MASK
THEIR
OWN
INADEQUACIES
I
HATE
TO
BELABOUR
THE
POINT
BUT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SPIRITS
AND
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
CANNOT
BE
OBJECTIVELY
DEMONSTRATED
OR
PROVEN
JUST
LIKE
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
CANNOT
AND
YES
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THERE
IS
A
RISK
THAT
ALL
MY
SUBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
IS
MANUFACTURED
BY
MY
BRAIN
CHEMICALS
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
COULD
VENTURE
INTO
SOLIPSISM
AND
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
A
RISK
THAT
EVERYTHING
THAT
I
APPEAR
TO
OBJECTIVELY
KNOW
IS
REALLY
MANUFACTURED
BY
MY
BRAIN
CHEMICALS
I
SUSPECT
THIS
IS
AN
UNSATISFACTORY
ANSWER
TO
A
REQUEST
FOR
EVIDENCE
AND
DEMONSTRATION
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SPIRITS
AND
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
BUT
MY
ASSERTION
IS
THAT
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
NOT
OBJECTIVELY
DEMONSTRABLE
AS
I
HAVE
SAID
BEFORE
I
MYSELF
AM
ON
THE
CHRISTIAN
SIDE
OF
AGNOSTICISM
HAVING
BEEN
PUSHED
OFF
THE
FENCE
BY
SUBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
AND
NO
I
WAS
NOT
RAISED
A
CHRISTIAN
SO
IT
IS
NOT
A
CASE
OF
SIMPLY
ACCEPTING
WHAT
I
WAS
INDOCTRINATED
WITH

THAT
AT
