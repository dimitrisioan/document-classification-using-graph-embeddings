GIVING
SPIRITUAL
GIFTS
I
JUST
THOUGHT
ID
SHARE
A
NICE
EXPERIENCE
BEFORE
MY
EXAM
TODAY
I
WAS
WALKING
DOWN
THE
STREETS
ON
OUR
CAMPUS
AND
A
BEGGAR
CAME
UP
AND
ASKED
ME
FOR
ANY
SPARE
CHANGE
I
MIGHT
HAVE
I
HAD
A
DOLLAR
OR
SO
THAT
I
GAVE
HER
AND
NOT
WANTING
TO
GIVE
AWAY
ALL
MY
MONEY
TO
STRANGERS
I
GENERALLY
GIVE
A
DOLLAR
AS
THAT
WILL
BUY
A
LITTLE
FOOD
AT
MCDONALDS
OR
SOMETHING
I
OFFERED
HER
SOME
SPIRITUAL
GIFTS
AS
I
CALLED
THEM
RATHER
THAN
GIFTS
OF
MONEY
I
TALKED
OF
HOW
GREAT
I
FELT
THAT
GOD
HAD
MADE
SUCH
A
PRETTY
DAY
AND
HOW
NICE
IT
WAS
TO
GIVE
TO
PEOPLE
SHE
THEN
SAID
SHE
WAS
GETTING
MARRIED
SOON
SHE
TALKED
ABOUT
HOW
SHE
AND
HER
HUSBAND
HAD
VERY
LITTLE
THEY
MAY
NOT
HAVE
EVEN
HAD
A
HOUSE
FOR
ALL
I
KNOW
BUT
THAT
THEY
FELT
A
VERY
SPECIAL
LOVE
IN
THE
LORD
AN
UNSELFISH
KIND
OF
CARING
IT
WARMED
MY
HEART
TO
KNOW
THAT
PEOPLE
CAN
HAVE
SO
LITTLE
MONETARILY
AND
REALIZE
THAT
SPIRITUALLY
THEY
ARE
INDEED
VERY
RICH
A
GOOD
LESSON
FOR
ALL
OF
US
WHO
SAY
WE
WANT
MORE
MORE
MORE
WHAT
WE
REALLY
NEED
CANNOT
BE
COUNTED
OR
SOLD
OR
BOUGHT
DOUG
FOWLER
HEAVEN
IS
A
GREAT
BIG
HUG
THAT
LASTS
FOREVER
AND
WHEN
THAT
ONE
GREAT
SCORER
COMES
TO
MARK
AGAINST
YOUR
NAME
HE
WRITES
NOT
WHETHER
YOUVE
WON
OR
LOST
BUT
HOW
YOU
PLAYED
THE
GAME
