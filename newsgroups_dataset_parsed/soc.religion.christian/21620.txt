after
reading
the
posts
on
this
newsgroup
for
the
pasts
months
it
has
become
apparent
to
me
that
this
group
is
primarily
active
with
liberals
catholics
new
agers
and
athiests
someone
might
think
to
change
the
name
to
socreligionany
or
perhaps
even
socreligionnew
it
might
seem
to
be
more
appropriate
heck
dont
flame
me
im
catholic
gay
and
i
voted
for
bill
clinton
im
on
your
side
since
when
did
conservative
protestant
oldtime
religion
believers
get
an
exclusive
francise
to
christianity
christianity
is
and
always
has
been
a
diverse
and
contentious
tradition
and
this
group
reflects
that
diversity
i
fo
one
am
not
ready
to
concede
to
any
group
be
they
liberal
or
conservative
catholic
protestant
or
orthodox
charismatic
or
not
the
right
to
claim
that
they
have
the
truth
and
everyone
else
is
not
christian
