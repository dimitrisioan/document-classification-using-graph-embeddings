heres
a
question
that
some
friends
and
i
were
debating
last
night
q
if
you
knew
beyond
all
doubt
that
hell
did
not
exist
and
that
unbelievers
simply
remained
dead
would
you
remain
a
christian
my
contention
is
that
if
you
answer
this
question
with
no
i
would
not
then
remain
a
christian
then
you
really
are
not
one
now
following
jesus
christ
has
everything
to
do
with
sharing
in
his
work
and
spreading
the
news
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
already
among
us
fearbased
religion
is
not
a
faithrelationship
with
the
one
who
made
us
all
so
does
that
mean
that
anyone
who
is
a
christian
to
avoid
hell
isnt
really
a
christian
at
all
it
sounds
like
it
to
me
