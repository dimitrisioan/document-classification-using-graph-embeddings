THE
EASY
WAY
OUT
EASY
VS
HARD
EASY
ON
WHO
I
HAD
A
RARE
VERY
PERSONAL
TALK
WITH
MY
MOTHER
LAST
YEAR
SHE
SAID
THAT
WHEN
SHE
AND
MY
FATHER
WERE
RAISING
WE
FOUR
CHILDREN
THEY
DID
NOT
TRY
TO
RAISE
US
IN
THIS
WORLD
AS
STRICTLY
AS
THEY
WERE
RAISED
IN
THEIR
NORWEGIAN
LUTHERAN
COMMUNITY
THEY
FELT
THAT
WE
WOULD
BE
ALIENATED
FROM
THEM
AND
IT
WOULD
CREATE
PROBLEMS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
MY
PARENT
DID
THE
VERY
TOLERANT
LOVING
THING
THEY
RAISED
US
WITHOUT
CONFLICT
WITHOUT
WHAT
WE
SAW
AS
UNREASONABLE
DEMANDS
AND
WERE
ALWAYS
ACCEPTING
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
WHAT
HAPPENED
WAS
THAT
I
GREW
UP
BELIEVING
IN
SITUATION
ETHICS
AND
NEVER
ABSOLUTES
I
BELIEVED
IN
A
LOVING
GOD
AND
MY
CONCEPT
OF
GOD
NEVER
INVOLVED
JUSTICE
OR
PUNISHMENT
NOR
WAS
THERE
ANY
CONCEPT
THAT
I
MAY
SOMEDAY
BE
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
THINGS
THAT
OFFENDED
HIMSINS
THAT
THE
WORLD
TOLD
ME
WERE
OK
MY
PARENTS
ARE
VERY
GOOD
HONEST
AND
MORAL
PEOPLE
THEY
RAISED
FOUR
EXTREMELY
HONEST
CHILDREN
YET
BEFORE
COMING
TO
A
MORE
COMPLETE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
GOD
WHICH
INCLUDES
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
JUSTICE
AND
PUNISHMENTI
COMMITTED
WHAT
I
NOW
BELIEVE
TO
BE
MANY
MANY
GRAVE
SINS
I
LIVED
WITH
A
PARTNER
OUTSIDE
OF
MARRIAGE
WAS
MARRIED
AND
DIVORCED
ONLY
AFTER
PHYSICAL
ABUSE
AND
NO
APPARENT
HOPE
FOR
CHANGEBUT
I
SHOULDNT
HAVE
MARRIED
TO
PERSON
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
MORE
MY
PARENTS
FELT
THEY
WERE
DOING
THE
LOVINGKIND
THING
BY
ALLOWING
US
TO
BE
WHO
WE
WERE
BY
NOT
IMPOSING
THEIR
STANDARDS
ON
US
AND
BY
ACCEPTING
UNQUESTIONINGLY
EVERYTHING
WE
DID
WITHOUT
JUDGEMENT
OR
COUNSEL
TODAY
IT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
APPALLING
FOR
ME
TO
LOOK
BACK
ON
WHAT
THEY
DID
ACCEPT
WITHOUT
A
WORD
IT
TAKES
COURAGES
TO
DARE
TO
HELP
SOULS
BECAUSE
YOU
MUST
SPEAK
UP
AND
SAY
WHAT
IS
UNPOPULAR
AND
DIFFICULT
AND
WHAT
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
HEAR
YOU
MUST
BE
ABLE
TO
SAY
WHAT
IS
HARD
AND
SAY
IT
AS
CHRIST
WOULD
WITH
LOVE
AND
COMPASSION
IT
INVOLVES
RISKPERHAPS
SOMEONE
YOU
LOVE
MAY
NOT
WANT
TO
HEAR
AND
WILL
STAY
AWAY
FROM
YOU
THIS
LIFE
IS
BUT
DUST
AS
LONG
AS
THE
COMFORT
OF
THIS
LIFE
IS
OUR
HIGHEST
PRIORITY
WE
WILL
FAIL
GOD
AND
FAIL
THOSE
WITH
WHOM
WE
COME
IN
CONTACT
I
WONDER
HOW
MANY
WHO
ENGAGE
IN
SEX
OUTSIDE
OF
MARRIAGE
WHO
SUPPORT
THE
RIGHT
TO
ABORTION
WHO
ENGAGE
IN
HOMOSEXUALITY
OR
WHO
COMMIT
ANY
OF
THE
RANGE
OF
SINS
THAT
ARE
PLENTIFUL
IN
THIS
TIME
HAVE
EVER
HEARD
FROM
A
QUIET
THOUGHTFUL
LOVING
FRIEND
THAT
THESE
THINGS
ARE
WRONG
NO
ONE
EVER
TOLD
ME
THAT
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING
WAS
WRONG
AND
I
SAW
MULTITUDES
AROUND
ME
LIVING
THE
SAME
WAY
I
WAS
AND
THEY
SEEMED
LIKE
GOOD
DECENT
PEOPLE
WOULDNT
KICK
DOGS
OR
BEAT
THE
ELDERLY
OR
BABIES
IT
IS
MORE
DIFFICULT
FOR
SINNERS
WITHOUT
A
GENUINE
PRAYER
LIFE
TO
HEAR
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THAN
IT
IS
TO
HEAR
A
LOVING
FRIEND
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
THE
NEXT
TIME
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
TELLS
YOU
THAT
A
FRIEND
IS
IN
ERROR
BUT
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
CAUSE
TROUBLE
RIGHTEOUS
PRAYERS
IS
GREAT
POWER
BUT
DONT
FORGET
THAT
WE
ARE
WE
ARE
CHRISTS
LIPS
AND
HANDS
ON
EARTH
DONT
BE
AFRAID
TO
SIMPLY
VOICE
TRUTH
WHEN
THE
SITUATION
CALLS
FOR
IT
SAY
A
FERVENT
PRAYER
AND
ASK
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
FOR
LOVE
AND
GUIDANCE
IN
MORE
WAYS
THAN
WE
MAY
REALIZE
WE
ARE
OUR
BROTHERS
KEEPER
IN
JESUS
AND
