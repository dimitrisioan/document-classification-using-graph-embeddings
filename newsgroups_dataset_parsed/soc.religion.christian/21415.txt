Q
IF
YOU
KNEW
BEYOND
ALL
DOUBT
THAT
HELL
DID
NOT
EXIST
AND
THAT
UNBELIEVERS
SIMPLY
REMAINED
DEAD
WOULD
YOU
REMAIN
A
CHRISTIAN
INTERESTING
QUESTION
ESP
SINCE
I
REMEMBER
WISHING
WITH
ALL
MY
HEART
THAT
THIS
WERE
TRUE
SO
THAT
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
TO
BE
A
GOOD
CHRISTIAN
ANYMORE
CHRISTIANITY
WAS
TERRIBLY
HARD
THE
ONLY
REWARD
WAS
HEAVEN
AND
MAYBE
SOMETIMES
IF
I
WAS
REALLY
GOOD
ACCEPTANCE
I
WANTED
A
WAY
OUT
IF
YOU
KNEW
THIS
BEYOND
ALL
DOUBT
THEN
YOU
WOULD
BE
FOOLISH
TO
BE
A
DISCIPLE
OF
A
MAN
WHO
CLAIMED
IT
DID
EXIST
THE
TRUTH
IS
YOU
CAN
NOT
BE
JESUS
DISCIPLE
AND
DISAGREE
WITH
HIM
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
NOT
ALLOWING
HIM
TO
BE
YOUR
LORD
WHAT
JESUS
HAS
DONE
FOR
ME
SINCE
I
FOUND
HIM
SOME
MONTHS
AGO
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
LOSE
PERIOD
THAT
SAID
I
ORIGINALLY
INTERPRETED
THE
WHATIF
AS
IF
CHRIST
NEVER
MENTIONED
SHEOL
AND
WEEPING
AND
GNASHING
OF
TEETH
IF
CHRIST
PREACHED
THAT
THOSE
WHO
DID
NOT
FOLLOW
HIM
DIED
AND
STAYED
DEAD
AND
AT
THAT
POINT
FOREVER
CEASED
TO
EXIST
FEARBASED
RELIGION
IS
NOT
A
FAITHRELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE
ONE
WHO
MADE
US
ALL
I
FOLLOW
CHRIST
BECAUSE
ITS
A
GREAT
WAY
TO
LIVE
LIFE
AND
I
COULD
CARE
LESS
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENS
AFTER
I
DIE
SO
IS
BEING
A
BUDDHIST
A
GREAT
WAY
TO
LIVE
LIFE
IM
NOT
CONVERTING
THOUGH
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
CAN
ONLY
BE
COMPLETE
THROUGH
CHRIST
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
BUDDHISTS
CAN
ALSO
BE
COMPLETE
