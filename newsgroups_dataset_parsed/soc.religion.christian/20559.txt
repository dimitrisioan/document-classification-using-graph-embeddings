RE
DID
HE
REALLY
RISE
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHO
THIS
POST
IS
DIRECTED
TOWARDS
WHO
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
CONVINCE
BY
ITS
SUBJECT
I
WOULD
ASSUME
YOU
ARE
DIRECTING
THE
ARGUMENT
TOWARDS
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
CHRIST
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
BUT
IN
YOUR
PROOF
YOU
USE
THE
BIBLE
EXCLUSIVELY
THE
POST
IS
THEREFORE
IMMEDIATELY
USELESS
TO
ANYONE
WHO
DOESNT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
AN
UNADULTERATED
TRUTH
AND
TO
EVERYONE
ELSE
IT
IS
JUST
A
REAFFIRMATION
OF
A
BELIEF
ALREADY
HELD
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
NO
DISAGREEMENT
BETWEEN
CHRISTIANS
OVER
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
CHRIST
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THIS
POST
TOMAS
BECAUSE
NO
BATTLE
IS
EVER
WON
HE
SAID
THEY
ARE
NOT
EVEN
FOUGHT
THE
FIELD
ONLY
REVEALS
TO
MAN
HIS
OWN
FOLLY
AND
DESPAIR
AND
VICTORY
IS
AN
ILLUSION
OF
PHILOSOPHERS
AND
FOOLS
