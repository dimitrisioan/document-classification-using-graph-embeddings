COLOSSIANS
IN
HIM
YOU
WERE
ALSO
CIRCUMCISED
IN
THE
AARON
PUTTING
OFF
OF
THE
SINFUL
NATURE
NOT
WITH
A
CIRCUMCISION
DONE
AARON
BY
CHRIST
HAVING
BEEN
BURIED
WITH
HIM
IN
BAPTISM
AND
RAISED
AARON
WITH
HIM
THROUGH
YOUR
FAITH
IN
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
WHO
RAISED
HIM
AARON
FROM
THE
DEAD
AARON
IN
BAPTISM
WE
ARE
RAISED
TO
A
NEW
LIFE
IN
CHRIST
ROMANS
AARON
THROUGH
A
PERSONAL
FAITH
IN
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
OUR
PARENTS
AARON
FAITH
CANNOT
DO
THIS
DO
INFANTS
HAVE
FAITH
LETS
LOOK
AT
AARON
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
HAS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
IT
YES
LET
DO
TRY
AND
IF
ANYONE
CAUSES
ONE
OF
THESE
LITTLE
ONES
WHO
BELIEVES
IN
ME
TO
SIN
IT
WOULD
BE
BETTER
FOR
HIM
TO
BE
THROWN
INTO
THE
SEA
WITH
A
LARGE
MILLSTONE
TIED
AROUND
HIS
NECK
MARK
LET
THE
LITTLE
CHILDREN
COME
TO
ME
AND
DO
NOT
HINDER
THEM
FOR
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
BELONGS
TO
SUCH
AS
THESE
I
TELL
YOU
THE
TRUTH
ANYONE
WHO
WILL
NOT
RECEIVE
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
LIKE
A
LITTLE
CHILD
WILL
NEVER
ENTER
IT
THE
COLOSSIANS
PASSAGE
DOES
NOT
MAKE
FAITH
A
REQUIREMENT
FOR
BAPTISM
IT
MERELY
SAYS
THAT
IN
BAPTISM
WE
ARE
BORN
AGAIN
REGENERATED
AND
RESURRECTED
THROUGH
FAITH
IN
THE
CASE
OF
AN
INFANT
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
BAPTISM
WORKS
FAITH
IN
THE
HEART
OF
THE
INFANTTHROUGH
THE
POWER
OF
THE
WORD
THE
COLOSSIANS
PASSAGE
DOES
MAKE
BAPTISM
A
SPIRITUAL
CIRCUMCISION
CIRCUMCISION
WAS
THE
MEANS
BY
WHICH
A
MALE
INFANT
WAS
MADE
A
PART
OF
GODS
COVENANT
WITH
ISRAEL
IT
WAS
COMMANDED
TO
BE
PERFORMED
ON
THE
EIGHTH
DAY
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
UNDERSTOOD
THIS
AND
EVEN
DEBATED
WHETHER
BAPTISM
HAD
TO
BE
PERFORMED
ON
THE
EIGHTH
DAY
OR
IF
IT
COULD
IN
FACT
BE
DONE
EARLIER
AARON
ROMANS
BUT
NOT
ALL
THE
ISRAELITES
ACCEPTED
THE
GOOD
AARON
NEWS
FOR
ISAIAH
SAYS
LORD
WHO
HAS
BELIEVED
OUR
MESSAGE
AARON
CONSEQUENTLY
FAITH
COMES
FROM
HEARING
THE
MESSAGE
AND
THE
AARON
MESSAGE
IS
HEARD
THROUGH
THE
WORD
OF
CHRIST
AARON
SO
THEN
WE
RECEIVE
GODS
GIFT
OF
FAITH
TO
US
AS
WE
HEAR
THE
AARON
MESSAGE
OF
THE
GOSPEL
AND
THE
GOSPEL
IS
SURELY
PREACHED
AT
ANY
INFANTS
OR
ADULTS
BAPTISM
INDEED
IN
A
VERY
REAL
SENSE
THE
SACRAMENTS
ARE
THE
GOSPEL
MADE
TANGIBLE
AARON
FAITH
IS
A
POSSIBLE
RESPONSE
TO
HEARING
AARON
GODS
WORD
PREACHED
KIDS
ARE
NOT
YET
SPIRITUALLY
AARON
INTELLECTUALLY
OR
EMOTIONALLY
MATURE
ENOUGH
TO
RESPOND
TO
AARON
GODS
WORD
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THEY
ARE
NOT
YET
MATURE
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
FAITH
DO
YOU
KNOW
THIS
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
GODS
WORD
OR
FROM
YOUR
OWN
REASON
FAITH
IS
ALSO
DESCRIBED
AS
A
GIFT
FROM
GOD
EPHESIANS
HE
GIVES
FAITH
TO
INFANTS
JUST
AS
HE
GIVES
IT
TO
ADULTS
THROUGH
THE
POWER
OF
THE
GOSPEL
ROMANS
AARON
IF
YOU
READ
ALL
OF
EZEKIEL
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
GOD
DOESNT
AARON
HOLD
US
GUILTY
FOR
ANYONE
ELSES
SINS
SO
WE
CAN
HAVE
NO
AARON
ORIGINAL
GUILT
FROM
ADAM
HERE
YOU
SHOW
THAT
YOU
JUST
DONT
UNDERSTAND
ORIGINAL
SIN
YOU
ARE
ARGUING
AGAINST
A
STRAW
MAN
MAYBE
YOUVE
BEEN
TALKING
TO
CATHOLICS
TOO
MUCH
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
ORIGINAL
SIN
DOES
NOT
CONSIST
OF
GODS
IMPUTATION
OF
ADAMS
GUILT
TO
US
IT
CONSISTS
OF
OUR
INHERITANCE
OF
ADAMS
SINFUL
NATURE
IT
IS
ACTUAL
SIN
SEE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
AUGSBURG
CONFESSION
ARTICLE
II
AND
THE
APOLOGY
OF
THE
AUGSBURG
CONFESSION
ARTICLE
II
AND
FOR
EXTRA
CREDIT
JOHN
KNOXS
THE
SCOTS
CONFESSION
ARTICLE
III
AARON
NOW
THEN
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
LITTLE
MORE
BACKGROUND
AS
TO
WHY
AARON
ORIGINAL
SIN
IS
NOT
BIBLICAL
LETS
LOOK
AT
SOME
OF
THE
AARON
SCRIPTURES
USED
TO
SUPPORT
IT
AARON
ROMANS
THEREFORE
JUST
AS
SIN
ENTERED
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
AARON
ONE
MAN
AND
DEATH
THROUGH
SIN
AND
IN
THIS
WAY
DEATH
CAME
TO
AARON
ALL
MEN
BECAUSE
ALL
SINNED
ASK
YOURSELF
THIS
QUESTION
DO
INFANTS
EVER
DIE
THEN
ASK
YOURSELF
IF
INFANT
BAPTISM
IS
NOT
VALID
THEN
WHERE
WAS
THE
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
DURING
ALL
THE
CENTURIES
WHEN
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THE
BAPTISMS
WERE
PERFORMED
ON
INFANTS
WERE
LUTHER
MELANCTHON
CALVIN
ZWINGLI
HUS
KNOX
ANDRAE
AND
CHEMNITZ
CHRISTIANS
AARON
PSALM
SURELY
I
WAS
SINFUL
AT
BIRTH
SINFUL
FROM
THE
TIME
AARON
MY
MOTHER
CONCEIVED
ME
AARON
THIS
WHOLE
PSALM
IS
A
WONDERFUL
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
WE
SHOULD
HUMBLE
AARON
OURSELVES
BEFORE
GOD
IN
REPENTANCE
FOR
SINNING
DAVID
HIMSELF
AARON
WAS
A
MAN
AFTER
GODS
OWN
HEART
AND
WROTE
THE
PSALM
AFTER
AARON
COMMITTING
ADULTRY
WITH
BATHSHEBA
AND
MURDERING
HER
HUSBAND
AARON
ALL
THAT
DAVID
IS
SAYING
HERE
IS
THAT
HE
CANT
REMEMBER
A
TIME
AARON
WHEN
HE
WASNT
SINFUL
HE
IS
HUMBLING
HIMSELF
BEFORE
GOD
BY
AARON
CONFESSING
HIS
SINFULNESS
HIS
SAYING
THAT
HE
WAS
SINFUL
AT
AARON
BIRTH
IS
A
HYPERBOLE
THE
BIBLE
BEING
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
ISNT
AARON
LIMITED
TO
A
LITERAL
INTERPETATION
BUT
ALSO
USES
FIGURES
OF
AARON
SPEECH
AS
DID
JESUS
JOHN
FOR
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
OF
AARON
HYPERBOLE
SEE
LUKE
WHO
ARE
YOU
TO
SAY
WHAT
IS
LITERAL
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
IS
A
LITERAL
INTERPRETATION
MANIFESTLY
ABSURD
IN
PSALM
BY
REASON
OF
DIRECT
CONTRADICTION
WITH
A
CLEAR
PASSAGE
FROM
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
YOU
MIGHT
ALSO
COMPARE
GENESIS
THE
LORD
SMELLED
THE
PLEASING
AROMA
AND
SAID
IN
HIS
HEART
NEVER
AGAIN
WILL
I
CURSE
THE
GROUND
BECAUSE
OF
MAN
EVEN
THOUGH
EVERY
INCLINATION
OF
HIS
HEART
IS
EVIL
FROM
CHILDHOOD
AARON
WE
SEE
AARON
THAT
HE
DID
GROW
AND
BECOME
WISER
IN
LUKE
AND
THE
AARON
IMPLICATION
IS
THAT
JESUS
DID
WRONG
THINGS
AS
A
CHILD
BEFORE
HE
AARON
KNEW
TO
CHOOSE
RIGHT
OVER
WRONG
YOU
ARE
A
LONG
WAY
FROM
PROVING
THIS
RATHER
MONSTROUS
ASSERTION
ALL
YOU
CAN
SAY
IS
THAT
JESUS
GREW
IN
WISDOM
AND
IN
STATURE
A
CONCLUSION
THAT
HE
DID
WRONG
AS
A
CHILD
IS
BASED
ON
AN
EXTRAPOLATION
OF
REASON
NOT
ON
A
DIRECT
REVELATION
IN
SCRIPTURE
DAVID
H
WAGNER
BUT
MAD
REASON
RUSHES
FORTH
AND
A
CONFESSIONAL
LUTHERAN
BECAUSE
BAPTISM
IS
NOT
DAZZLING
LIKE
THE
WORKS
WHICH
WE
DO
REGARDS
IT
AS
WORTHLESS
MARTIN
LUTHER
LARGE
CATECHISM
