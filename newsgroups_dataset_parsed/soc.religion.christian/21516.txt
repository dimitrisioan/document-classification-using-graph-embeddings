I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
SATAN
I
WAS
TAUGHT
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
THAT
SATAN
WAS
REALLY
AN
ANGEL
OF
GOD
AND
WAS
KICKED
OUT
OF
HEAVEN
BECAUSE
HE
CHALLENGED
GODS
AUTHORITY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
I
CANNOT
FIND
THIS
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
IT
IN
THE
BIBLE
IF
NOT
WHERE
DID
IT
ORIGINATE
THE
QUICK
ANSWER
REVELATION
AND
AS
SOMEONE
MENTIONED
EARLIER
FROM
THE
APOCRYPHAL
BOOK
OF
ENOCH
SATAN
WAS
APPARENTLY
KICKED
OUT
FOR
THREE
TIMES
ASSERTING
HIS
OWN
WILL
I
WILL
HMMMPROCHOICE
LOOKS
KINDA
CREEPY
HERE
THEN
THERE
ARE
THE
REFERENCES
AROUND
THE
BIBLE
ABOUT
TAKING
A
THIRD
OF
THE
ANGELS
GETTING
A
THIRD
OF
THE
HEAVENS
OR
SOMETHING
