i
dont
think
most
people
understand
what
a
christian
is
it
is
certainly
not
what
i
see
a
lot
in
churches
rather
i
think
it
should
be
a
way
of
life
and
a
total
sacrafice
of
everything
for
gods
sake
he
loved
us
enough
to
die
and
save
us
so
we
should
do
the
typical
statement
from
an
irrational
and
brainwashed
person
the
bible
was
written
by
some
male
chavnist
thousands
of
years
ago
as
were
all
of
the
holy
books
follow
the
parts
that
you
think
are
suitable
for
modern
life
ignore
the
others
for
heavens
sake
dont
take
it
literally
please
leave
heaven
out
of
it
for
his
own
sake
i
pray
that
dan
does
take
it
literally
because
thats
how
god
intended
it
to
be
taken
dan
your
view
of
many
groups
appears
correct
from
my
point
of
view
however
i
have
found
a
group
which
is
truly
meeting
requirements
laid
down
by
the
bible
on
what
it
means
to
be
a
disciple
of
jesus
i
have
no
clue
where
wwc
is
but
please
mail
me
id
really
like
to
get
you
in
touch
with
them
same
hey
we
cant
do
it
god
himself
inspires
us
to
turn
our
lives
over
to
him
thats
tuff
and
most
people
dont
want
to
do
it
to
be
a
real
christian
would
be
something
for
the
strong
to
persevere
at
but
insert
deletion
of
ranting
about
other
religions
which
obviously
has
gone
offcenter
of
dans
original
context
dan
im
familiar
with
this
one
youve
got
a
point
though
there
are
some
who
dont
want
to
turn
over
everything
and
be
a
disciple
some
have
no
clue
about
it
because
theyve
not
been
taught
some
have
done
exactly
that
and
turned
over
everything
to
follow
jesus
some
are
blocked
by
difficult
doctrine
taught
by
uncaring
pharisees
and
teachers
of
the
law
however
jesus
pointed
out
what
it
takes
to
follow
him
and
to
be
his
disciple
in
luke
and
luke
my
question
is
why
do
people
ignore
the
command
and
treat
it
as
optional
i
certainly
dont
have
an
answer
to
this
insert
deletion
parting
question
would
you
have
become
a
christian
if
you
had
not
been
indoctrinated
by
your
parents
you
probably
never
learned
about
any
other
religion
to
make
a
comparative
study
and
therefore
i
claim
you
are
brain
washed
my
parents
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
god
had
and
has
everything
to
do
with
it
as
for
these
attacking
responses
i
must
say
that
i
disagree
with
your
tone
and
what
appears
to
be
some
very
judgmental
statements
possibly
to
the
point
of
slander
when
talking
about
people
not
what
they
do
please
if
you
have
a
response
state
it
instead
of
flying
off
the
handle
on
some
discourse
which
may
have
nothing
truly
to
do
with
what
is
being
discussed
im
sure
both
dan
and
i
would
have
a
much
happier
time
with
your
responses
