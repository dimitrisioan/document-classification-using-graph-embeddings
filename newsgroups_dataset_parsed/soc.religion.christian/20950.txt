i
dont
see
what
the
problem
is
to
christians
hell
is
by
definition
eternal
deathexactly
what
atheists
are
expecting
when
they
die
theres
no
reason
hell
has
to
be
especially
awfulto
most
people
eternal
death
is
bad
enough
literal
interpreters
of
the
bible
will
have
a
problem
with
this
view
since
the
bible
talks
about
the
fires
of
hell
and
such
personally
i
dont
think
that
people
in
hell
will
be
thrust
into
flame
any
more
than
i
expect
to
jesus
with
a
doubleedged
sword
issuing
from
his
mouthi
treat
both
these
statements
as
metaphorical
phew
that
takes
a
load
off
i
dont
want
to
live
forever
i
wish
most
christians
held
this
view
you
cant
walk
across
campus
in
spring
without
being
assailed
by
fireandbrimstone
preachers
i
really
think
the
metaphor
should
be
limited
at
least
with
respect
to
teaching
our
children
its
criminal
to
put
these
ideas
into
a
young
and
trusting
mind
besides
why
not
rely
on
the
positive
aspects
of
your
religion
to
win
their
faith
