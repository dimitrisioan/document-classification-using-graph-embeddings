RE
CHRISTIANITY
AND
REPEATED
LIVES
WHILE
THIS
IS
ESSENTIALLY
A
DISCUSSION
OF
REINCARNATION
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
CHRISTIANITY
GERRY
PALO
HAS
MADE
SOME
COMPARISONS
TO
ASIAN
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
ON
THIS
TOPIC
WHICH
HAVE
SIMPLIFIED
THE
ASIAN
IDEA
OF
KARMA
TO
THE
POINT
OF
MISREPRESENTATION
THERE
ARE
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
IDEA
OF
KARMA
AMONG
HINDUS
JAINS
BUDDHISTS
AND
EVEN
AMONG
THE
VARIOUS
BUDDHIST
TRADITIONS
TO
REFER
TO
KARMA
AS
A
SYSTEM
OF
REWARD
FOR
PAST
DEEDS
IS
TOTALLY
INCORRECT
IN
THE
BUDDHIST
AND
JAIN
TRADITIONS
KARMA
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
A
MORAL
PROCESS
IN
WHICH
INTENTIONS
EITHER
GOOD
OR
EVIL
SHAPE
A
PERSONS
PREDILECTIONS
FOR
FUTURE
INTENTION
AND
ACTION
AND
PRODUCE
A
PERSON
WHO
IS
MORE
PRONE
TO
GOOD
THAN
EVIL
OR
THE
OPPOSITE
REWARD
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
BOTH
JAINISM
AND
BUDDHISM
ARE
ATHEISTIC
SO
THERE
IS
NO
DEITY
TO
DISPENSE
REWARDS
OR
PUNISHMENTS
KARMA
IS
USUALLY
DESCRIBED
IN
TERMS
OF
SEEDS
AND
REAPING
THE
FRUIT
THEREOF
IN
FACT
AS
YOU
SOW
SO
SHALL
YOU
REAP
IS
FOUND
IN
THE
PALI
CANON
AS
I
RECALL
THE
METAPHOR
OF
NATURAL
GROWTH
IS
EXPLICIT
HINDUISM
OR
SOME
SECTS
IN
THAT
TRADITION
ARE
I
BELIEVE
MUCH
MORE
DETERMINISTIC
AND
INVOLVE
CONCEPTS
CLOSER
TO
REWARD
AND
PUNISHMENT
BEING
THEISTICALLY
INCLINED
IN
POINT
OF
FACT
THE
THERAVADIN
BUDDHIST
TRADITION
OF
SOUTHEAST
ASIA
CONSIDERS
KARMA
AS
ONLY
ONE
OF
FIVE
INFLUENCES
IN
HUMAN
LIFE
AND
IN
FACT
FROM
THEIR
POINT
OF
VIEW
THEY
WOULD
BE
UNABLE
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
MECHANICS
OF
KARMA
WITHOUT
THE
ELEMENT
OF
FREE
WILL
ALSO
IN
EASTERN
RELIGIONS
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
REINCARNATION
AND
REBIRTH
WHICH
IS
ESSENTIALLY
ABSENT
IN
WESTERN
CONSIDERATIONS
ISNT
ORIGEN
USUALLY
CITED
AS
THE
MOST
PRESTIGIOUS
PROPONENT
OF
REINCARNATION
AMONG
CHRISTIAN
THINKERS
WHAT
WERE
HIS
VIEWS
AND
HOW
DID
HE
RELATE
THEM
TO
THE
CHRISTIAN
SCRIPTURES
