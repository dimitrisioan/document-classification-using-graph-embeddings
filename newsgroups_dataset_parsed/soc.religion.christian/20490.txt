QUALITY
OF
CATHOLIC
LITURGY
I
WOULD
LIKE
THE
OPINION
OF
NETTERS
ON
A
SUBJECT
THAT
HAS
BEEN
BOTHERING
MY
WIFE
AND
ME
LATELY
LITURGY
IN
PARTICULAR
CATHOLIC
LITURGY
IN
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THERE
ARE
MORE
AND
MORE
AD
HOC
EVENTS
DURING
MASS
ITS
DRIVING
ME
CRAZY
THE
MOST
GRACEFILLED
ASPECT
OF
A
LITURGICAL
TRADITION
IS
THAT
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
SOMETHING
WE
ALL
DO
TOGETHER
BECAUSE
WE
ALL
KNOW
HOW
TO
DO
IT
LED
BY
THE
PRIEST
OF
COURSE
WHICH
MAKES
IT
A
KIND
OF
DIALOGUE
WE
PRESENT
TO
GOD
BUT
THE
BEST
MASSES
IVE
BEEN
TO
WERE
PARTICIPATORY
PRAYERS
LATELY
I
THINK
THE
PROPORTION
OF
PARTICIPATION
HAS
FALLEN
AND
THE
PROPORTION
OF
SITTING
THERE
AND
WATCHING
OR
LISTENING
OR
GENERALLY
BEING
TOLD
WHAT
TO
DO
WHICH
IS
NECESSARY
BECAUSE
NO
ONE
KNOWS
WHATS
HAPPENING
NEXT
IS
GROWING
EXAMPLE
LAST
SUNDAY
PALM
SUNDAY
WE
WENT
TO
THE
LOCAL
CHURCH
USUALLY
ON
PALM
SUNDAY
THE
CONGREGATION
PARTICIPATES
IN
READING
THE
PASSION
TAKING
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
MOB
THE
THEOLOGY
BEHIND
THIS
SEEMS
PROFOUNDWHEN
WE
SAY
CRUCIFY
HIM
WE
MEAN
IT
WE
DID
IT
AND
IF
HE
CAME
BACK
TODAY
WED
DO
IT
AGAIN
IT
ALWAYS
GIVES
ME
CHILLS
BUT
LAST
WEEK
WE
WERE
INVITED
TO
SIT
DURING
THE
GOSPEL
PASSION
AND
LISTEN
BESIDES
THE
ORWELLIAN
INVITATION
I
WAS
REALLY
SADDENED
TO
HAVE
MY
AND
OUR
LITTLE
ROLE
TAKEN
AWAY
THIS
SEEMS
TYPICAL
OF
A
SHIFT
OF
PARTICIPATION
AWAY
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
AND
TOWARD
THE
MUSICIANS
READERS
AND
SO
ON
NEW
THINGS
ARE
INTRODUCED
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
LITURGY
AND
SINCE
NO
ONE
KNOWS
WHATS
HAPPENING
THE
NEW
THINGS
HAVE
TO
BE
EXPLAINED
AND
PRETTY
SOON
INSTEAD
OF
DOING
A
LOT
OF
THE
MASS
WERE
JUST
SITTING
THERE
LISTENING
OR
SPACING
OUT
IN
MY
CASE
TO
HOW
THE
MASS
IS
ABOUT
TO
BE
DONE
IN
MY
MIND
I
LAY
THE
BLAME
ON
LITURGY
COMMITTEES
MADE
UP
OF
LAY
EXPERTS
BUT
THAT
MAY
NOT
BE
JUST
I
DO
THINK
THAT
A
LITURGY
COMMITTEE
HAS
A
BIAS
TOWARD
DOING
SOMETHING
RATHER
THAN
NOTHINGTHATS
JUST
A
FACT
OF
BUREAUCRATIC
LIFEEVEN
THOUGH
A
SIMPLER
LITURGY
MAY
IN
FACT
MAKE
IT
EASIER
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
BE
AWARE
OF
THE
LORDS
PRESENCE
SO
WEVE
BEEN
WONDERINGARE
WE
THE
ODDBALLS
OR
IS
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
MASS
GOING
DOWN
I
DONT
MEAN
THAT
FACETIOUSLY
WE
GO
TO
MASS
EVERY
THURSDAY
OR
FRIDAY
AND
ARE
REMINDED
OF
THE
POWER
OF
A
VERY
SIMPLE
LITURGY
TO
MAKE
US
AWARE
OF
GODS
PRESENCE
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
THE
OBLIGATORY
SUNDAY
MASSESMAYBE
I
SHOULD
JUST
OFFER
IT
UP
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
NOTICED
DECLINING
CONGREGATIONAL
PARTICIPATION
IN
CATHOLIC
MASSES
