WRITES
AND
IT
SHOULD
BE
NOTED
THAT
THE
MONOPHYSITE
CHRUCHES
OF
EGYPT
AND
SYRIA
ALSO
HOLD
TO
THIS
BELIEF
AS
PART
OF
DIVINE
REVELATION
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
BROKE
AWAY
FROM
THE
UNITY
OF
THE

IN
AD
BY
REJECTING
THE

IT
MIGHT
BE
ARGUED
BY
SOME
PROTESTANTS
THAT
THE
CATHOLICS
AND
ORTHODOX
MADE
THIS
BELIEF
UP
BUT
THE
MONOPHYSITES
PUT
A
BIG
HOLE
IN
THAT
NOTION
AS
THEY
ALSO
HOLD
THE

SPLIT

MONOPHYSITE
IS
FALSE
AS
IS
THE
BELIEF
THAT
THEY
OFTEN

THE
COUNCIL
OF
CHALCEDON
WAS
NESTORIAN
THESE
MISUNDERSTANDINGS
WERE
EXACERBATED
BY
POLITICAL
FACTORS

THUS
LED
TO
SCHISM
A
SCHISM
