WRITES
IN
HISTORY
SEEMS
TO
IMPLY
SOME
PRETTY
SERIOUS
SIN
THE
ONE
OF
THE
PASTORS
IN
THE
CHURCH
I
ATTEND
CHRISTCHURCH
CITY
ELIM
CONSIDERS
THAT
A
PROPHESY
OF
A
NATURAL
DISASTER
AS
A
JUDGEMENT
FROM
THE
LORD
IS
A
CLEAR
SIGN
THAT
THE
PROPHESY
IS
NOT
FROM
THE
LORD
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
HIS
REASONING
BEHIND
THIS
YOU
MAY
HAVE
GOTTEN
IF
I
GET
A
CHANCE
I
WILL
ASK
THEM
THIS
WEEKEND
BURNED
BY
NATURAL
DISASTER
PROPHECIES
DOWN
THERE
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
EVERY
NATURAL
DISASTERJUDGEMENT
PROPHECY
IS
FALSE
TAKE
A
QUICK
LOOK
AT
THE
BOOK
OF
JEREMIAH
AND
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
JUDGEMENT
PROPHECIES
CAN
BE
VALID
HERE
IN
THE
US
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
MORE
OF
A
PROBLEM
WITH
POSITIVE
PROPHECIES
THOUGH
I
AM
SURE
THERE
MAY
BE
A
FEW
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
TOO
INTO
JUDGEMENT
THE
WORDS
I
HAVE
UNDERLINED
ARE
AT
THE
HEART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
A
QUICK
LOOK
DOESNT
DO
JUSTICE
TO
THE
DEPTH
OF
THE
BOOK
OF
JEREMIAH
HAVING
STUDIED
THE
JEREMIAHEZEKIAL
PERIOD
SOLIDLY
FOR
OVER
A
YEAR
AT
ONE
STAGE
OF
MY
LIFE
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
UNDERLYING
THEOLOGICAL
MEANING
IN
THE
JUDGEMENT
PROPHESIES
LET
ME
MAKE
ONE
POINT
THE
CLASH
BETWEEN
JEREMIAH
AND
THE
FALSE
PROPHETS
WAS
PRIMARILY
IN
THE
THEOLOGICAL
REALM
THE
FALSE
PROPHETS
UNDERSTOOD
THEIR
RELATIOSHIP
TO
GOD
TO
BE
BASED
ON
THE
COVENANT
THAT
THE
LORD
MADE
WITH
DAVID
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
TRACE
WITHIN
THE
PAGES
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
WHO
THIS
COVENANT
WHICH
WAS
INITIALLY
CONDITIONAL
ON
THE
CONTINUED
OBEDIENCE
OF
DAVIDS
DESCENDANTS
CAME
TO
BE
VIEWED
AS
AN
UNCONDITIONAL
PROMISE
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
LORD
TO
KEEP
A
DESCENDANT
OF
DAVIDS
UPON
THE
THRONE
AND
TO
NEVER
ALLOW
JERUSALEM
TO
SUBJEGATED
BY
ANY
FOREIGN
POWER
JEREMIAH
WAS
NOT
A
JUDAHITE
PROPHET
HE
WAS
FROM
ANATHOTH
ACROSS
THE
BORDER
IN
WHAT
HAD
FORMERLY
BEEN
ISRAELITE
TERRITORY
WHEN
HE
CAME
TO
PROPHESY
HE
CAME
FROM
THE
THEOLOGICAL
BACKGROUND
OF
THE
COVENANT
THE
LORD
HAD
MADE
WITH
ISRAEL
THROUGH
MOSES
THE
NORTHERN
KINGDOM
HAD
REJECTED
THE
DAVIDIC
COVENANT
AFTER
THE
DEATH
OF
SOLOMON
HIS
THEOLOGY
CLASHED
WITH
THE
THEOLOGY
OF
THE
LOCAL
PROPHETS
IT
WAS
OUT
OF
A
VERY
DEEP
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
MOSAIC
COVENANT
AND
AN
ACTUTE
AWARENESS
OF
INTERNATIONAL
EVENTS
THAT
JEREMIAH
SPOKE
HIS
PROPHESIES
THE
JUDGEMENT
PROPHESIES
WERE
DEEPLY
LOADED
WITH
THEOLOGICAL
MEANING
IN
MY
OPINION
BOTH
THE
PORTLAND
EARTHQUAKE
PROPHESY
AND
THE
DAVID
WILKERSON
NEW
YORK
WILL
BURN
PROPHESY
ARE
FROTH
AND
BUBBLE
COMPARED
TO
THE
MAJESTIC
THEOLOGICAL
DEPTHS
OF
THE
JEREMIAH
PROPHESIES
