RE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
AGAIN
IN
THE
NORMAL
PROTESTANT
INTERPRETATION
SUNDAY
IS
NOT
A
LAW
AND
WORSHIPPING
ON
ANOTHER
DAY
IS
NOT
A
SIN
CHURCHES
ARE
FREE
TO
DECIDE
ON
THE
DAY
THEY
WILL
MEET
JUST
AS
THEY
ARE
FREE
TO
DECIDE
ON
THE
HOUR
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
A
SIN
TO
WORSHIP
ON
SOME
OTHER
DAY
BUT
IF
YOU
BELONG
TO
A
CHURCH
THAT
WORSHIPS
ON
SUNDAY
AND
YOU
SHOW
UP
ON
MONDAY
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
WORSHIP
ALONE
CLH
I
TOTALLY
AGREE
WITH
THAT
SENTIMENT
BUT
WHY
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
FURTHER
AND
ADVOCATE
VIOLATING
WHAT
GOD
HAS
SET
UP
THAT
IS
THE
QUESTION
WHICH
YOU
HAVE
NOT
ANSWERED
FROM
SCRIPTURE
YOU
CAN
WORSHIP
ON
EVERY
DAY
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
WORK
BUT
GOD
SAYS
THE
SABBATH
IS
ALL
MINE
DARIUS
