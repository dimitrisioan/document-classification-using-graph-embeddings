WRITES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ONE
IMPORTANT
THING
THAT
THOSE
WHO
WROTE
THE
OLD
AND
NEW
TESTAMENT
PASSAGES
CITED
ABOVE
DID
NOT
KNOW
WAS
THAT
THERE
IS
SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
AT
LEAST
PARTLY
INHERENT
RATHER
THAN
COMPLETELY
LEARNED
THIS
MEANS
THAT
TO
A
CERTAIN
EXTENT
OR
TO
A
GREAT
EXTENT
HOMOSEXUALS
CANNOT
CHOOSE
HOW
TO
FEEL
BUT
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
BASIC
CONCEPTS
OF
CHRISTIAN
MORALITY
IS
THAT
WE
ALL
HAVE
DEFECTIVE
APPETITES
DUE
TO
ORIGINAL
SIN
NOT
JUST
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
EVERYBODY
THUS
WE
ARE
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
INDULGE
IN
WHATEVER
BEHAVIOR
OUR
BODIES
WANT
US
TO
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
KEEP
CLEAR
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
WHICH
IS
WRONG
AND
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
WHICH
IS
NOT
A
SIN
MERELY
A
MISFORTUNE
