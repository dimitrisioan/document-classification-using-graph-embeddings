therefore
babies
are
born
in
such
a
state
that
should
they
die
they
are
cuf
off
from
god
and
put
in
hell
which
is
exactly
the
doctrine
of
st
augustine
and
st
thomas
i
havent
read
this
entire
thread
but
if
someone
hasnt
tossed
this
out
yet
then
here
it
is
samuel
rsv
then
his
servants
said
to
him
what
is
this
thing
that
you
have
done
you
fasted
and
wept
for
the
child
while
it
was
alive
but
when
the
child
died
you
arose
and
ate
food
he
david
said
while
the
child
was
still
alive
i
fasted
and
wept
for
i
said
who
knows
whether
the
lord
will
be
gracious
to
me
that
the
child
may
live
but
now
he
is
dead
why
should
i
fast
can
i
bring
him
back
again
i
shall
go
to
him
but
he
will
not
return
to
me
anyhow
many
interpret
this
to
mean
that
the
child
has
gone
to
heaven
where
david
will
someday
go
i
dont
claim
to
know
for
sure
if
this
applies
to
all
babies
or
not
but
even
if
its
just
this
one
what
would
you
say
to
this
