RE
MARYS
ASSUMPTION
IN
ARTICLE
BRIAN
FINNERTY
BFINNERTCHAPHUSCEDU
WRITES
ONE
LAST
POINT
AN
EXCATHOLIC
ATTEMPTED
TO
EXPLAIN
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
BY
ASSERTING
IT
IS
CONNECTED
TO
A
BELIEF
THAT
MARY
DID
NOT
DIE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
CORRECT
SUMMARY
OF
WHAT
CATHOLICS
BELIEVE
THE
DOGMA
OF
THE
ASSUMPTION
WAS
CAREFULLY
PHRASED
TO
AVOID
SAYING
WHETHER
MARY
DID
OR
DID
NOT
DIE
IN
FACT
THE
CONSENSUS
AMONG
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGIANS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
MARY
IN
FACT
DID
DIE
THIS
WOULD
MAKE
SENSE
CHRIST
DIED
AND
HIS
MOTHER
WHO
WAITED
AT
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
CROSS
WOULD
WANT
TO
SHARE
IN
HIS
DEATH
THE
ABOVE
ARTICLE
IS
A
GOOD
SHORT
SUMMARY
OF
TRADITIONAL
CHRISTIAN
TEACHING
CONCERNING
THE
DEATH
OF
MARY
ALSO
VERY
GOOD
IS
RE
QUESTION
ABOUT
THE
VIRGIN
MARY
BY
MICHEAL
D
WALKER
HE
TELLS
THE
STORY
VERY
WELL
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ADD
THAT
IN
THE
EASTERN
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
WE
CELEBRATE
THE
DORMITION
OR
FALLING
ASLEEP
OF
THE
THEOTOKOS
THE
MOTHER
OF
GOD
THE
ICON
FOR
THIS
DAY
SHOWS
MARY
LYING
ON
A
BED
SURROUNDED
BY
THE
APOSTLES
WHO
ARE
WEEPING
CHRIST
IN
HIS
RESURRECTED
GLORY
IS
THERE
HOLDING
WHAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
SMALL
CHILD
THIS
IS
IN
FACT
MARYS
SOUL
ALREADY
WITH
CHRIST
IN
HEAVEN
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
IS
ONE
MORE
CONFIRMATION
FOR
US
AS
CHRISTIANS
THAT
CHRIST
DID
INDEED
CONQUER
DEATH
IT
FORSHADOWS
THE
GENERAL
RESURRECTION
ON
THE
LAST
DAY
THE
DISCIPLES
WERE
NOT
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
MARYS
BODY
MISSING
FROM
THE
GRAVE
SHE
WAS
THE
MOTHER
OF
THE
SAVIOR
SHE
WAS
THE
FIRST
OF
ALL
CHRISTIANS
SHE
GAVE
BIRTH
TO
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
FOR
HER
WE
WOULD
NOT
BE
SAVED
THIS
IS
WHY
WE
PRAY
IN
THE
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
THROUGH
THE
PRAYERS
OF
THE
THEOTOKOS
SAVIOR
SAVE
US
TIMOTHY
RICHARDSON
