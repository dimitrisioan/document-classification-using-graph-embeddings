RE
HOMOSEXUAL
ISSUES
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THERES
SOME
AMBIGUITY
ABOUT
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORDS
IN
THE
PASSAGE
YOU
QUOTE
BOTH
LIBERAL
AND
CONSERVATIVE
SOURCES
SEEM
TO
AGREE
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
IS
NOT
THE
GENERAL
TERM
FOR
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
IS
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
A
MEANING
LIKE
HOMOSEXUAL
PROSTITUTE
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
OF
MY
EXPERIENCE
IN
LOOKING
UP
THIS
WORD
AND
DISCUSSING
IT
WITH
A
GREEKLITERATE
INDIVIDUAL
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORD
IS
RATHER
CLEAR
BASICALLY
IT
LITERALLY
MEANS
HE
WHO
BEDS
WITH
A
MAN
OR
HE
WHO
HAS
SEX
WITH
A
MAN
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IS
ON
THE
PROHOMOSEXUALITY
SIDE
OF
THE
ARGUMENT
TO
SHOW
THAT
THE
WORD
HAS
AN
IDIOMATIC
MEANING
NOR
EVIDENT
FROM
ITS
LITERAL
MEANING
ONE
CAN
SPECULATE
ALL
DAY
LONG
THAT
IT
MIGHT
MEAN
SOMETHING
ELSE
BUT
WE
NEED
EVIDENCE
BEFORE
WE
CREATE
NEW
DOCTRINES
AND
GET
RID
OF
THE
HISTORICAL
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
MEANING
OF
THIS
WORD
LINK
HUDSON
IVE
READ
ENOUGH
DISCUSSIONS
OF
THIS
PASSAGE
IN
BOTH
LIBERAL
AND
CONSERVATIVE
SOURCES
TO
BE
SURE
THAT
THE
MEANING
EVEN
THE
LITERAL
MEANING
IS
NOT
CERTAIN
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
ONE
CANT
COME
TO
SOME
CONCLUSION
NOR
DOES
IT
MEAN
THAT
I
THINK
THERES
ANY
DOUBT
ABOUT
WHAT
PAUL
THINKS
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
THERE
ARE
PLAUSIBLE
ARGUMENTS
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
DIFFERENT
MEANINGS
