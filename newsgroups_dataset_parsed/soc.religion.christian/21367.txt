WRITES
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
VIEWS
ABOUT
THE
NONEVENT
OF
MAY
SERIOUSLY
HOW
CAN
A
CHRISTIAN
DISCRIMINATE
BETWEEN
MESSAGES
FROM
GOD
WHICH
ARE
TO
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
AND
THOSE
WHICH
ARE
SPURIOUS
IS
THERE
A
USEFUL
HEURISTIC
WHICH
WOULD
HELP
US
AVOID
EMBRACING
MESSAGES
WHICH
BY
THEIR
NONFULFILLMENT
ARE
PROVEN
TO
BE
FALSE
THUS
CAUSING
THE
NAME
OF
CHRIST
TO
BE
PLACED
IN
DISREPUTE
IS
THIS
A
PROBLEM
AT
ALL
I
BELIEVE
THAT
A
CAREFUL
UNDERSTANDING
OF
SCRIPTURE
CAN
HELP
US
HERE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ANYTIME
WE
ARE
PROVEN
BY
EVENTS
TO
BE
MISTAKEN
IT
POINTS
TO
A
SERIOUS
FAILURE
IN
UNDERSTANDING
GODS
WILL
IT
SHOULD
RESULT
IN
A
REEVALUATION
OF
WHAT
WE
ACCEPT
AS
TRUTH
I
MUST
HASTEN
TO
ADD
THAT
I
WAS
ALWAYS
SKEPTICAL
EVEN
CYNICAL
ABOUT
THESE
PROPHESIES
AS
I
TEND
TO
BE
CONCERNING
ALL
SUCH
BUT
CLEARLY
MANY
CHRISTIANS
PUT
MUCH
STOCK
IN
THEM
IF
THE
CHURCH
REPRESENTS
CHRIST
IN
THE
WORLD
THEN
CHRISTIANS
MUST
AVOID
BEING
MADE
THE
LAUGHINGSTOCK
OF
THE
WORLD
LEST
WE
DISHONOR
HIM
FURTHER
THE
MORE
OFTEN
WE
CRY
WOLF
THE
LESS
SERIOUSLY
WE
TEND
TO
BE
TAKEN
ANY
COMMENTS
GOOD
POINT
IT
IS
VERY
TRUE
THAT
THESE
FALSE
PREDICTIONS
ARE
DANGEROUSWE
ARE
WARNED
MORE
THAN
ONCE
IN
SCRIPTURE
ABOUT
FALSE
PROPHTETS
HOWEVER
AS
IS
OFTEN
THE
CASE
WITH
OTHER
ISSUES
ONE
CANNOT
LET
THOSE
WHO
FALSLY
REPORT
SUCH
VISIONS
AS
A
REASON
AGAINST
BELIEVING
IN
ANY
OF
THEM
I
DID
NOT
GET
THE
IMPRESSION
YOU
WERE
ASSERTING
THIS
BY
THE
WAYI
CONSIDER
MY
RESPONSE
NOT
SO
MUCH
A
RESPONSE
TO
YOUR
POSTING
BUT
A
RESPONSE
TO
THE
TOPIC
AS
A
WHOLE
EXAMPLE
THE
APPEARANCES
OF
MARY
AT
FATIMA
PORTUGAL
IN
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
SHE
PREDICTED
THE
CONVERSION
OF
RUSSIA
TO
ATHEISM
SOMETHING
THAT
HAPPENED
LESS
THAN
A
YEAR
LATER
W
THE
BOLSHEVIK
REVOLUTION
SHE
ALSO
PREDICTED
THE
SECOND
WORLD
WAR
THAT
IS
PREDICTE
PREDICTED
THAT
IT
WOULD
OCCUR
DURING
THE
PAPACY
OF
A
CERTAIN
POPE
WHO
WAS
NOT
THE
CURRENT
ONE
IT
HAPPENED
JUST
LIKE
SHE
SAID
SHE
WARNED
THERE
WOULD
BE
FIRE
IN
THE
SKY
AS
A
WARNING
THAT
THE
SECOND
WORLD
WAR
WAS
ABOUT
TO
START
ABOUT
A
WEEK
BEFORE
GERMANY
INVADED
WEATHERMEN
AND
WOMEN
I
SUPPOSE
ALL
OVER
EUROPE
FROM
ENGLAND
TO
SPAIN
TO
EASTERN
EUROPE
REPORTED
THE
MOST
SPECTACULAR
REDDISH
COLOR
IN
THE
SKY
EVER
RECORDED
TO
THIS
DAY
SOME
TRY
TO
EXPLAIN
IT
OFF
AS
THE
NORTHERN
LIGHTS
AND
THE
RELATION
TO
MARYS
PREDICTION
SIMPLY
COINCIDENCE
YOU
ALL
CAN
DECIDE
FOR
YOURSELVES
MARY
PREDICTED
THAT
THE
ATHEISTIC
RUSSIA
WOULD
SPREAD
HER
EVILS
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD
AND
PERSECUTE
RELIGION
SHE
SAID
MANY
OTHER
THINGS
AS
WELL
TOO
NUMEROUS
TO
LIST
HERE
EVERY
SINGLE
ONE
HAS
BEEN
REALIZED
ONE
CAN
ONLY
USE
THE
TERM
COINCIDENCE
SO
MANY
TIMES
IN
THE
SAME
EXPLANATION
BEFORE
ITS
USE
BECOMES
RIDICULOUS
SOYES
THERE
ARE
MANY
FALSE
PROPHETS
AND
MANY
FALSE
REPORTS
THERE
ARE
TRUE
ONES
TOO
WE
MUST
ALWAYS
REMAIN
OPEN
TO
THAT
FATIMA
WAS
ONE
EXAMPLE
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
ONE
CURRENTLY
OCCURINGTHE
APPARITIONS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
TAKING
PLACE
AT
MEDJURGORJE
YUGOSLAVIA
OR
WHATEVER
ITS
CALLED
NOW
MARY
HAS
BEEN
APPEARING
EVERY
DAY
FOR
ELEVEN
YEARS
NOW
ITS
TIME
THE
WORLD
STARTED
LISTENING

TO
ANY
WHO
