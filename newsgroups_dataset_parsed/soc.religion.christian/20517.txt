RE
PANTHEISM
AND
ENVIRONMENTALISM
KEVXUCUNYVMBITNET
WRITES
DELETED
FIRST
PARAGRAPH
AND
THE
MENTION
OF
PANTHEISM
IS
PANTHEISM
PERVERTED
AND
DANGEROUS
OR
JUST
NOT
ONES
CUP
OF
TEA
NONE
OF
THIS
IS
CLEAR
I
CANT
SPEAK
FOR
MR
CAVANO
BUT
I
UNDERSTOOD
HIS
COMMENT
TO
REFER
TO
THE
IDEA
THAT
UNRECOGNIZED
PANTHEISM
IS
DANGEROUS
TO
CHRISTIANS
IF
WE
UNTHINKINGLY
ADOPT
PANTHEISTIC
IDEAS
THAT
ARE
OPPOSED
TO
CHRISTIANITY
WE
CAN
PERVERT
OUR
FAITH
WHEN
WE
CLEARLY
RECOGNIZE
PANTHEISM
WHEN
WE
ENCOUNTER
IT
WE
HAVE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
EMBRACE
WHAT
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
AND
REJECT
WHAT
ISNT
WE
NEED
TO
BE
ALERT
ALWAYS
THINKING
AND
QUESTIONING
WE
MUST
EXAMINE
THE
UNDERLYING
ASSUMPTIONS
OF
EVERY
BOOK
WE
READ
TV
PROGRAM
WE
WATCH
AND
SOCIOPOLITICAL
MOVEMENT
WE
PARTICIPATE
IN
IDEAS
ARE
IMPORTANT
PHILOSOPHIES
AND
DOCTRINES
ARE
WHAT
GIVE
FORM
TO
THE
EVENTS
OF
OUR
LIVES
THEY
ARE
THE
BASIS
FROM
WHICH
WE
LIVE
OUR
LIVES
OF
LOVE
AND
SERVICE
THE
COMMAND
TO
LOVE
GOD
WITH
ALL
ONES
MIND
MEANS
NO
FUZZY
HEADED
DRIFTING
FROM
IDEA
TO
IDEA
AND
THAT
CONSUMERISM
AND
OUR
RAPACIOUS
STYLE
OF
LIVING
ARE
SO
RARELY
CALLED
BY
THEIR
APPROPRIATE
NAME
GREED
ONE
CHRISTIAN
WHO
ACKNOWLEDGES
THIS
IS
THE
POPE
IT
IS
A
FREQUENT
THEME
IN
HIS
WRITINGS
INDEED
THOUGHTFUL
CHRISTIANS
FROM
MOST
TRADITIONS
RECOGNIZE
THAT
CONSUMERISM
HAS
NO
PLACE
IN
THE
LIVES
OF
CHRISTIANS
IT
TOO
IS
A
PERVERSION
AND
DANGEROUS
TO
OUR
FAITH
THANK
YOU
JACK
FOR
POINTING
