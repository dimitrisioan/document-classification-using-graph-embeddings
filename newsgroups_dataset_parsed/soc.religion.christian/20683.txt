ANOTHER
ANSWER
IS
THAT
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
SOUNDS
MUCH
BETTER
BUT
I
AM
TEMPTED
TO
ASK
DOES
GOD
HIMSELF
EXIST
THEN
IF
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
OWN
EXISTENCE
IT
CAN
ONLY
MEAN
THAT
HE
HAS
IN
TERMS
OF
HUMAN
TIME
ALWAYS
EXISTED
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
ARGUMENT
SOUNDS
LIKE
GOD
DOES
NOT
EXIST
BUT
METAEXISTS
AND
FROM
HIS
METAEXISTENT
PERSPECTIVE
HE
CREATED
EXISTENCE
I
THINK
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
A
NONSOLUTION
A
MERE
TWIST
OF
WORDS
ALWAYS
EXISTING
AND
BEING
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ALL
OTHER
BEINGS
IS
NOT
PROBLEMATIC
BUT
AS
YOU
PUT
BEING
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
INCLUDING
ONES
OWN
WOULD
MEAN
THAT
GOD
CAME
FROM
NOTHING
A
CONCEPT
ALIEN
TO
CHRISTIANITY
AND
THEISM
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
CLASSICAL
CONCEPTS
OF
NECESSARY
AND
CONTINGENT
EXISTENCE
GOD
EXISTS
NECESSARILY
ALWAYS
GOD
CREATED
CONTINGENT
BEINGS
THIS
IS
A
COHERENT
SOLUTION
TO
EXISTENCE
SO
LONG
AS
THE
CONCEPT
OF
GOD
IS
COHERENT
THE
BEST
ANSWER
I
HAVE
HEARD
IS
THAT
HUMAN
REASONING
IS
INCAPABLE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
SUCH
QUESTIONS
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
MYSELF
I
DO
NOT
ACCEPT
SUCH
ANSWERS
SINCE
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
OTHER
METHODS
NOT
A
VERY
GOOD
ANSWER
IF
REASON
CANNOT
BY
ANY
MEANS
UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING
THEN
IT
IS
LIKELY
THAT
IT
IS
A
NULL
CONCEPT
SOMETHING
NOT
IN
REALITY
