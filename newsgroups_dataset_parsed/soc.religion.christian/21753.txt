NABIL
WROTE
BOTH
FAMILIES
AGREE
THAT
HE
WHO
WILLS
AND
ACTS
IS
ALWAYS
THE
ONE
HYPOSTASIS
OF
THE
LOGOS
INCARNATE
MARHABA
NABIL
IF
WE
POSIT
TWO
MINDS
IN
CHRIST
THE
MIND
OF
THE
LOGOS
AND
THE
MIND
OF
THE
HUMAN
JESUS
THEN
WE
MUST
ADMIT
TWO
WILLS
A
MIND
IS
NOT
A
MIND
WITHOUT
A
WILL
I
KNOW
THIS
HAS
BEEN
DEALT
WITH
IN
PAST
CHURCH
PRNOUNCEMENTS
BUT
THERE
IS
A
PHILOSOPHICAL
PROBLEM
HERE
THAT
SHOULD
EXAMINED
T
V
MORRIS
ARGUED
THAT
THE
INCARNATION
CAN
BE
SEEN
LIKE
THIS
MIND
OF
LOGOS
HERE
THE
MIND
OF
JESUS
IS
CIRCUMSRIBED
BY
GOD
THE
HUMAN
SON
GOD
THE
SON
HAS
COMPLETE
ACCESS
TO
THE
HUMAN
MIND
MIND
BUT
THE
HUMAN
MIND
ONLY
HAS
ACCESS
TO
THE
MIND
OF
GOD
THE
SON
WHEN
THE
SON
ALLOWS
ACCESS
THIS
EXPLAINS
WHY
JESUS
SAID
EVEN
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
THE
TIME
OF
THE
KINGDOM
THE
IDEAS
OF
A
COMPLETELY
HEALTHY
VERSION
OF
SPLIT
PERSONALITY
FROM
THE
FIELD
OF
PSYCHOLOGY
AND
THE
INTRIGUING
IDEAS
OF
BEING
IN
A
DREAM
SEEING
YOURSELF
ACTING
KNOWING
THAT
IS
YOU
BUT
ALSO
BEING
OMNISCIENT
IVE
EXPLAINED
IT
HERE
BEFORE
IF
YOU
WANT
THE

DOCUMENT
ASK
ME
BY

REX
QUESTIONS
ARISE
AS
WE
BEGIN
TO
THINK
ABOUT
LOGOS
AND
WHAT
HIS
INNER
CONSCIOUSNESS
WAS
COMPOSED
OF
WE
NEED
TO
CLARIFY
THE
TWO
NATURES
OF
CHRIST
BRIEFLY
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
WHICH
HAS
EXISTED
ETERNALLY
DID
NOT
UNDERTAKE
ANY
ESSENTIAL
CHANGES
DURING
THE
INCARNATION
WHICH
WOULD
CAUSE
A
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
ATTRIBUTES
OF
GOD
THE
FOREMOST
OF
THESE
BEING
HIS
IMMUTABILITY
THIS
WOULD
MEAN
THAT
IT
REMAINED
IMPASSABLE
THAT
IS
INCAPABLE
OF
SUFFERING
AND
DEATH
FREE
FROM
IGNORANCE
AND
INSUSCEPTIBLE
TO
WEAKNESS
AND
TEMPTATION
IN
THE
REALM
OF
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
SON
OF
GOD
BECAME
THAT
WHICH
WAS
NOT
ABSOLUTEAND
IN
HIMSELF
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
INCARNATION
WAS
THAT
THE
DIVINE
LOGOS
COULD
BE
IGNORANT
AND
WEAK
COULD
BE
TEMPTED
AND
SUFFER
AND
DIE
NOT
IN
HIS
DIVINE
NATURE
BUT
BY
THE
DERIVATION
OF
HIS
POSSESSION
OF
A
HUMAN
NATURE
THIS
WOULD
MEAN
THAT
BOTH
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
AND
THE
HUMAN
NATURE
ARE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
PERSON
AND
THEREFORE
ASCRIBED
TO
THE
PERSON
BY
THIS
REASON
WE
CAN
SAY
THAT
THE
PERSON
CAN
BE
OMNIPOTENT
OMNISCIENT
AND
OMNIPRESENT
YET
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
BE
ALSO
A
MAN
OF
LIMITED
POWER
KNOWLEDGE
A
MAN
OF
SORROWS
SUBJECT
TO
HUMAN
WANTS
AND
MISERIES
THERE
IS
HOWEVER
NO
PENETRATION
OF
ONE
NATURE
INTO
THE
OTHER
DEITY
CAN
NO
MORE
SHARE
THE
IMPERFECTIONS
OF
HUMANITY
THAN
HUMANITY
CAN
SHARE
IN
THE
ESSENTIAL
PERFECTION
OF
THE
GODHEAD
WE
ARE
NOT
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DOUBLE
PERSONALITY
DUE
TO
THE
POSSESSION
OF
THE
DOUBLE
NATURES
CHRISTS
HUMAN
NATURE
IS
IMPERSONAL
IN
THAT
IT
ATTAINS
SELFCONSCIOUSNESS
AND
SELFDETERMINATION
IN
THE
PERSONALITY
OF
THE
GODMAN
WE
MUST
NOW
DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN
THE
PERSON
AND
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
MAN
NATURE
IS
DEFINED
THE
DISTINGUISHING
QUALITIES
OR
PROPERTIES
OF
SOMETHING
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
CHARACTER
DISPOSITION
OR
TEMPERAMENT
OF
A
LIVING
BEING
INNATE
AND
UNCHANGEABLE
NATURE
IS
THEN
IN
ESSENCE
THE
SUBSTANCE
POSSESSED
IN
COMMON
IN
AS
SUCH
THE
TRINITY
HAVE
ONE
NATURE
THERE
IS
ALSO
A
COMMON
NATURE
OF
MANKIND
PERSONALITY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
THE
SEPARATE
SUBSISTENCE
OF
NATURE
WITH
THE
POWER
OF
CONSCIOUSNESS
AND
WILL
IT
IS
FOR
THIS
REASON
THAT
THE
HUMAN
NATURE
OF
CHRIST
HAS
NOT
NOR
EVER
HAD
A
SEPARATE
SUBSISTENCE
THAT
IT
IS
IMPERSONAL
LOGOS
THE
GODMAN
REPRESENTS
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
PERSONALITY
IT
IS
EQUALLY
IMPORTANT
TO
SEE
THAT
SELFCONSCIOUSNESS
AND
SELFDETERMINATION
DO
NOT
AS
SUCH
BELONG
TO
THE
NATURE
IT
IS
FOR
THIS
REASON
THAT
WE
CAN
JUSTIFIABLY
SAY
THAT
JESUS
DID
NOT
HAVE
TWO
CONSCIOUSNESS
OR
TWO
WILLS
BUT
RATHER
ONE
IT
IS
THEANTHROPIC
AN
ACTIVITY
OF
THE
ONE
PERSONALITY
WHICH
UNITES
IN
ITSELF
THE
HUMAN
AND
THE
DIVINE
NATURES
BEING
THAT
NEITHER
THE
CONSCIOUSNESS
NOR
THE
WILL
ARE
SIMPLY
HUMAN
OR
SIMPLY
DIVINE
THE
QUOTATION
GIVEN
ABOVE
IS
NOT
IDENTIFIED
AND
ITS
NOT
ENTIRELY
CLEAR
TO
ME
WHAT
POSITION
LOREN
IS
TAKING
ON
IT
JUST
FOR
CLARITY
LET
ME
NOTE
THAT
THE
VIEW
EXPRESSED
IN
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
CLASSIC
CHRISTOLOGICAL
HERESIES
MONOTHELITISM
THATS
THE
POSITION
THAT
CHRISTS
TWO
NATURES
WERE
NOT
COMPLETE
IN
THAT
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
WILL
IN
MOST
CASES
WHICH
I
THINK
INCLUDES
THIS
EXAMPLE
IT
WAS
THE
HUMAN
WILL
THAT
WAS
REGARDED
AS
MISSING
NORMALLY
PEOPLE
WHO
TALK
ABOUT
CHRISTS
HUMAN
NATURE
AS
BEING
IMPERSONAL
MEAN
IT
IN
A
SOMEWHAT
MORE
ABSTRACT
SENSE
THAT
IS
THEY
ARE
USING
PERSON
AS
HYPOSTATIS
NOT
IN
THE
USUAL
ENGLISH
SENSE
OF
PERSONALITY
IN
THIS
USE
THE
DOCTRINE
IS
CALLED
ANHYPOSTASIA
PERSONALLY
I
THINK
ANHYPOSTASIA
IS
JUST
A
MORE
SOPHISTICATED
WAY
OF
DENYING
THAT
THE
LOGOS
TOOK
ON
HUMANITY
FULLY
HOWEVER
IT
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
FORMALLY
RULED
A
HERESY
AND
IN
FACT
HAS
BEEN
HELD
BY
INFLUENTIAL
THEOLOGIANS
BOTH
ANCIENT
AND
MODERN
EG
ATHANASIUS
BUT
THE
QUOTATION
ABOVE
APPEARS
TO
BE
GOING
FARTHER
THAN
EVEN
ATHANASIUS
WENT
INTO
THE
REALM
OF
THE
OVERTLY
HERETICAL
CLH
