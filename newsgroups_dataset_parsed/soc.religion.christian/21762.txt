I
DONT
NECESSARILY
OBJECT
TO
THE
SECRECY
BUT
I
DO
QUESTION
IT
SINCE
I
SEE
NO
BIBLICAL
REASON
WHY
ANY
ASPECT
OF
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
SHOULD
INVOLVE
SECRECY
EARLY
IN
CHURCH
HISTORY
THE
CATECHUMENS
WERE
DISMISSED
PRIOR
TO
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
EUCHARIST
IT
WAS
SECRET
GIVING
RISE
TO
THE
RUMORS
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WERE
CANNIBALS
AND
ALL
SORTS
OF
PERVERSE
CLAIMS
THE
ACTIONS
WERE
CONSIDERED
TOO
HOLY
TO
BE
OBSERVED
BY
NONCHRISTIANS
AS
WELL
AS
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
FOR
THE
INDIVIDUAL
CHRISTIAN
WHO
MIGHT
BE
IDENTIFIED

LARRY
THANKS
FOR
THE
REPLY
BUT
THIS
ISNT
QUITE
THE
SAME
THING
LIKE
I
SAID
BEFORE
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
WHY
NONCHRISTIANS
WOULD
BE
DENIED
ACCESS
TO
HOLY
CEREMONIES
BUT
THE
CEREMONY
ITSELF
COMMUNION
WAS
NOT
SECRET
IN
FACT
ALL
FOUR
GOSPELS
RECORD
THE
FIRST
BREAKING
OF
THE
BREAD
IN
SOME
DETAIL
COMMUNION
WAS
A
FELLOWSHIP
MEAL
AND
IT
WAS
AND
STILL
SHOULD
BE
IN
MY
OPINION
INAPPROPRIATE
TO
INVITE
THOSE
WHO
DID
NOT
SHARE
IN
THE
FELLOWSHIP
OF
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
THE
FACT
THAT
UNBELIEVERS
DENIED
ACCESS
TO
THESE
COMMUNAL
MEALS
BEGAN
TO
IMAGINE
ALL
SORTS
OF
SECRET
AND
DEBASED
RITUALS
DURING
COMMUNION
DOES
NOT
BY
ANY
MEANS
IMPLY
THAT
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
WERE
IN
FACT
HIDING
SHAMEFUL
THINGS
FROM
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
IN
FACT
I
THINK
IF
YOU
READ
SOME
OF
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
FATHERS
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
AT
ALL
BASHFUL
ABOUT
DESCRIBING
WHAT
WENT
ON
DURING
COMMUNION
THATS
WHY
IT
SEEMS
FUNNY
TO
ME
WHEN
MORMONS
WHO
CLAIM
TO
BE
THE
ONLY
TRUE
RESTORATION
OF
CENTURY
CHRISTIANITY
INSIST
ON
HIDING
CERTAIN
RITUALS
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
THEY
ARE
TOO
SACRED
MARK
ACTUALLY
THATS
NOT
QUITE
THE
CASE
JOHN
OMITS
THE
CENTRAL
ELEMENTS
OF
THE
LAST
SUPPER
HIS
GOSPEL
IS
FULL
OF
SYMBOLISM
OF
BREAD
AND
WINE
BUT
THE
ACTUAL
STORY
ISNT
THERE
SOME
PEOPLE
THINK
HE
HAS
OMITTED
SOME
OF
THE
DETAILS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
NOT
TALKED
ABOUT
IN
PUBLIC
IN
HIS
COMMUNITY
THERE
IS
ALSO
EVIDENCE
THAT
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
BAPTISMAL
PRACTICE
WERE
KEPT
SECRET
SEE
MORTON
SMITHS
SECRET
GOSPEL
I
DONT
AGREE
WITH
HIS
LURID
SPECULATIONS
ON
WHAT
THE
SECRET
PRACTICES
ACTUALLY
WERE
BUT
THERE
DOES
SEEM
TO
BE
SOME
EVIDENCE
THAT
MARK
OMITTED
CERTAIN
DETAILS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
INAPPROPRIATE
