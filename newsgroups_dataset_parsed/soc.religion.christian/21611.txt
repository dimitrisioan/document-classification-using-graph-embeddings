RE
HOMOSEXUALITY
ISSUES
IN
CHRISTIANITY
IN
ARTICLE
ANN
CARLSON
WRITES
ANYONE
WHO
THINKS
BEING
GAY
AND
CHRISTIANITY
ARE
NOT
COMPATIBLE
SHOULD
CHECK
OUT
DIGNITY
INTEGRITY
MORE
LIGHT
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCHES
AFFIRMATION
MCC
CHURCHES
ETC
MEET
SOME
GAY
CHRISTIANS
FIND
OUT
WHO
THEY
ARE
PRAY
WITH
THEM
DISCUSS
SCRIPTURE
WITH
THEM
AND
ONLY
THEN
FORM
YOUR
OPINION
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
START
YOUR
OWN
RELIGION
THIS
WOULD
BE
FINE
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
SCRIPTURAL
BASIS
FOR
YOUR
STATEMENT
IN
FACT
IT
REALLY
GETS
TO
THE
HEART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
YOU
THINK
YOU
KNOW
MORE
THAN
SCRIPTURE
YOUR
FAITH
IS
DRIVEN
BY
FEEL
GOODISM
AND
NOT
BY
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
JUST
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NICE
PEOPLE
DOESNT
MAKE
IT
RIGHT
YOU
CAN
START
ALL
THE
CHURCHES
YOU
WANT
AND
IT
WONT
CHANGE
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
IS
WRONG
THAT
IS
NOT
TO
IMPLY
THAT
GAYS
DONT
DESERVE
THE
SAME
LOVE
AND
FORGIVENESS
THAT
ANYONE
ELSE
DOES
BUT
TO
CALL
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
RIGHT
JUST
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NICE
PEOPLE
IS
BASELESS
AND
IT
OFFERS
SATAN
A
PERFECT
PLACE
TO
WORK
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
CHECK
ON
WHAT
HE
IS
DOING
I
SUSPECT
ANN
WAS
SUGGESTING
THAT
YOU
LOOK
TO
SEE
WHETHER
THE
SPIRIT
IS
ALIVE
AMONG
THEM
NOT
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
NICE
PEOPLE
THOUGH
THERES
SOMETHING
TO
BE
SAID
FOR
BEING
NICE
TOO
