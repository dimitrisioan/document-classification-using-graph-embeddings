QUESTIONS
FROM
A
NEWBIE
IS
LIFE
A
PASSFAIL
COURSE
AND
DOES
GOD
GRADE
ON
A
CURVE
IM
NEW
HERE
AND
ONLY
VAGUELY
RELIGIOUS
BUT
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHAT
SOME
OF
YOU
PEOPLE
THINK
SPECIFICALLY
ARE
THERE
AN
INFINITE
NUMBER
OF
HEAVENS
AND
A
PERSON
GOES
TO
THE
ONE
THAT
HESHE
DESERVES
OR
IS
IT
SIMPLY
HEAVEN
OR
NOTHING
HELL
ALSO
ARE
WE
GRADED
BY
THOSE
AROUND
US
OR
HAS
THERE
ALWAYS
BEEN
SOME
UNCHANGING
METHOD
IS
THE
PERSONS
CHILDHOOD
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IM
SURE
THESE
MUST
SOUND
LIKE
OVERSIMPLIFICATIONS
TO
MOST
OF
YOU
BUT
I
FIGURE
THAT
YOURE
THE
EXPERTS
QUINN
ESCHATOLOGY
IS
AN
AREA
ON
WHICH
CHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
AGREE
I
SUSPECT
THATS
BECAUSE
OUR
PRIMARY
SOURCE
OF
INFORMATION
IS
PROPHETS
AND
VISIONARIES
AND
THEIR
WRITINGS
TEND
TO
BE
HIGHLY
SYMBOLIC
HOWEVER
BOTH
JESUS
TEACHINGS
IN
THE
GOSPELS
AND
BOOKS
SUCH
AS
THE
REVELATION
TO
JOHN
TALK
PRIMARILY
ABOUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
ETERNAL
DEATH
ON
A
NUMBER
OF
OCCASIONS
JESUS
DOES
SAY
THINGS
THAT
IMPLY
SOME
SORT
OF
DIFFERENTIATION
EG
LK
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
SIMILAR
PASSAGES
WHERE
JESUS
SAYS
THINGS
LIKE
EVEN
XXX
WILL
BE
BETTER
OFF
THAN
YOU
IN
THE
JUDGEMENT
ALSO
I
COR
TALKS
ABOUT
SOMEONE
WHO
GETS
INTO
HEAVEN
BUT
BY
THE
SKIN
OF
HIS
TEETH
AS
IT
WERE
BUT
THESE
PASSAGES
ARE
NOT
NORMALLY
INTERPRETED
AS
SUGGESTING
SEPARATE
HEAVENS
SO
MUCH
AS
DIFFERING
LEVELS
OF
PRESTIGE
OR
PUNISHMENT
IN
HEAVEN
OR
HELL
AND
NOT
ALL
CHRISTIANS
WOULD
EVEN
GO
AS
FAR
AS
THAT
THE
ONLY
CHRISTIAN
GROUP
I
KNOW
OF
THAT
BELIEVES
IN
MULTIPLE
HEAVENS
IS
THE
MORMONS
AND
THEY
ARE
VERY
FAR
FROM
MAINSTREAM
CHRISTIANITY
FAR
ENOUGH
THAT
MANY
OF
OUR
READERS
WOULD
NOT
CALL
THEM
CHRISTIAN
THEIR
IDEAS
IN
THIS
AREA
INVOLVE
SPECIFIC
MORMON
REVELATIONS
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
BIBLE
AND
HOLY
TRADITION
OF
A
MORE
GENERIC
CHRISTIAN
SORT
NOTE
THAT
MANY
CHRISTIANS
WILL
CRINGE
AT
THE
VERY
THOUGHT
OF
ASSOCIATING
GRADING
WITH
GOD
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
CHRIST
WAS
TO
FREE
US
FROM
THE
RESULTS
OF
A
TEST
THAT
WE
COULDNT
POSSIBLY
PASS
IF
YOU
LIKE
TEST
ANALOGIES
GOD
GRADES
ON
A
VERY
STRICT
AND
UNBENDING
SCALE
BUT
HE
ALSO
CHEATS
HE
REPLACES
OUR
TEST
PAPERS
WITH
AN
EXAM
THAT
WAS
PREPARED
BY
THE
TEACHER
BEFORE
ACTUALLY
DOING
THE
GRADING
BECAUSE
SOME
PEOPLE
END
UP
IN
HEAVEN
AND
OTHERS
IN
HELL
ITS
EASY
TO
SEE
WHY
YOUD
BE
INCLINED
TO
THINK
OF
IT
AS
GRADING
WHILE
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENCES
AMONG
BRANCHES
OF
CHRISTIANITY
ON
DETAILS
I
THINK
WE
ALL
AGREE
THAT
IN
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
GOD
CHEATS
I
AM
PERSONALLY
VERY
SCEPTICAL
ABOUT
ANYONE
WHO
CLAIMS
TO
KNOW
EXACTLY
HOW
FAR
GODS
CHEATING
EXTENDS
WILL
HE
ACCEPT
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
EXPLICITLY
ACKNOWLEDGE
CHRIST
BUT
SOMEHOW
STILL
FOLLOW
HIM
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
MANY
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
AT
LEAST
IN
PRINCIPLE
BUT
CERTAINLY
NOT
ALL
DO
JESUS
PROVIDED
US
WITH
A
CLEAR
DESCRIPTION
OF
HOW
TO
BE
SAVED
BUT
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
HE
PROVIDED
AN
EXACT
DESCRIPTION
OF
HOW
HES
GOING
TO
PLACE
THE
DIVIDING
LINE
CERTAINLY
HE
MADE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
WE
CANT
EXPECT
TO
KNOW
WHETHER
OTHER
INDIVIDUALS
ARE
SAVED
OR
NOT
