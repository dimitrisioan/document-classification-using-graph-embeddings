IM
ENTERING
THIS
DISCUSSION
RATHER
LATE
BUT
I
DO
HAVE
ONE
QUESTION
WASNT
IT
A
REAGAN
APPOINTEE
JAMES
WATT
A
PENTACOSTAL
CHRISTIAN
I
THINK
WHO
WAS
THE
SECRETARY
OF
THE
INTERIOR
WHO
SAW
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
DEFORESTATION
SINCE
WE
WERE
LIVING
IN
THE
LAST
DAYS
AND
OURS
WOULD
BE
THE
LAST
GENERATION
TO
SEE
THE
REDWOODS
ANYWAY
FOR
THE
RECORD
ON
FEBRUARY
AT
A
HOUSE
OF
REPRESENTATIVES
INTERIOR
COMMITTEE
MEETING
REP
JAMES
WEAVER
D
ORE
ASKED
WATT
WHETHER
YOU
AGREE
THAT
WE
SHOULD
SAVE
SOME
OF
OUR
SCENIC
RESOURCES
FOR
OUR
CHILDREN
NOT
JUST
GOBBLE
THEM
UP
ALL
AT
ONCE
WATTS
ANSWER
WAS
ABSOLUTELY
THAT
IS
THE
DELICATE
BALANCE
THE
SECRETARY
OF
THE
INTERIOR
MUST
HAVE
TO
BE
STEWARD
FOR
THE
NATURAL
RESOURCES
FOR
THIS
GENERATION
AS
WELL
AS
FUTURE
GENERATIONS
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
MANY
FUTURE
GENERATIONS
WE
CAN
COUNT
ON
BEFORE
THE
LORD
RETURNS
WHATEVER
IT
IS
WE
HAVE
TO
MANAGE
WITH
A
SKILL
TO
HAVE
THE
RESOURCES
NEEDED
FOR
FUTURE
GENERATIONS
