IN

WHATS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
GAY
CHRISTIANS
SEX
OR
CHRISTIANITY
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
HOPE
WOULD
THEY
BE
WILLING
TO
FORGO
SEX
COMPLETELY
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
BEING
A
STUMBLING
BLOCK
TO
OTHERS
TO
AVOID
THE
CHANCE
THAT
THEIR
INTERPRETATION
MIGHT
BE
WRONG
ETC
IF
NOT
WHY
NOT
HETEROSEXUALS
ABSTAIN
ALL
THE
TIME
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
PROTESTANT
CHURCHES
HAD
CELIBATE
ORDERS
TO
SHOW
THE
WORLD
THAT
SEX
IS
NOT
THE
IMPORTANT

IN
LIFE
TO
TELL
THE
TRUTH
GAY
CHURCHES
REMIND
ME
A
LOT
OF
HENRY

STARTING
THE
CHURCH
OF
ENGLAND
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
A
DIVORCE
OR
IS
THIS
A
MYTH
NOTE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
DENYING
THAT
GAY
CHRISTIANS
ARE
CHRISTIAN
