concluding
lexicographic
note
this
might
be
better
directed
to
srcbiblestudy
which
i
have
begun
reading
but
since
my
earlier
notes
were
posted
to
this
forum
i
will
conclude
here
as
well
a
week
ago
i
managed
to
find
time
to
consult
a
septuagint
concordance
and
a
lxx
text
with
apparatus
at
the
library
and
i
can
now
usefully
conclude
my
look
at
the
greek
words
for
love
as
used
in
the
christian
background
of
the
septuagintal
translation
of
the
jewish
scriptures
the
principal
result
is
that
there
is
a
cluster
of
uses
of
the
verbal
noun
from
erao
erastes
meaning
lover
this
cluster
occurs
just
where
one
might
most
expect
it
in
the
propethic
image
and
accusation
of
israel
as
faithless
spouse
to
yhwh
the
verses
in
question
are
hosea
jeremiah
lamentations
and
ezekiel
and
hosea
seems
to
have
originated
this
usage
which
jeremiah
and
ezekiel
picked
up
lamentations
is
dependent
on
though
not
likely
written
by
jeremiah
the
erotic
meaning
in
its
allegorical
use
not
at
all
literally
is
evident
so
too
in
english
unless
you
complement
it
with
a
phrase
like
of
the
arts
the
word
lover
is
going
to
have
an
overtone
of
sexual
relationship
there
is
no
surprise
here
but
it
is
worthwhile
to
see
that
standard
greek
usage
does
show
up
in
the
translations
from
the
hebrew
more
interestingly
and
some
confirmation
of
my
guess
that
later
koine
usage
avoided
the
verb
erao
because
of
its
homonymy
to
ero
say
eromai
ask
there
is
an
error
in
codex
vaticanus
normally
a
very
valuable
witness
where
a
form
of
erao
is
used
in
a
completely
absurd
context
samuel
where
the
meaning
must
be
say
in
addition
to
the
above
and
the
uses
i
have
already
mentioned
in
proverbs
esther
uses
the
verb
in
its
most
natural
application
kai
erasthe
ho
basileus
esther
and
the
king
loved
esther
and
rather
more
interestingly
samuel
supplies
a
modest
degree
of
support
to
the
gay
appraisal
of
the
relationship
of
david
and
jonathan
kai
ionathan
huios
saoul
eireito
ton
dauid
sphodra
and
jonathan
sauls
son
loved
david
intensely
im
using
the
bracketed
i
for
iota
subscript
which
i
dont
yet
have
a
reasonable
ascii
convention
for
the
relevance
of
this
to
the
gay
issue
is
not
anything
implicit
about
the
historical
facts
but
just
that
a
quasiofficial
translation
of
the
hebrew
text
in
the
hellenistic
period
makes
no
bones
about
using
the
erotic
verb
in
this
context
given
the
quite
general
usage
of
agapao
for
erotic
senses
this
need
not
mean
anything
more
than
agapao
alone
would
mean
but
it
does
disambiguate
the
relationship
as
far
as
this
translator
goes
