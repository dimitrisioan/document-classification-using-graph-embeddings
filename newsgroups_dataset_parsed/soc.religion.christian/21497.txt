BAPTISM
REQUIRES
FAITH
IT
TROUBLES
ME
THAT
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SO
MANY
POSTS
RECENTLY
TRYING
TO
SUPPORT
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
THIS
IS
PRIMARILY
A
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
WITH
NO
OTHER
PURPOSE
THAN
TO
DEFEND
THE
IDEA
OF
INFANT
BAPTISM
EVEN
AMONG
ITS
SUPPORTERS
HOWEVER
PEOPLE
WILL
STOP
SHORT
OF
SAYING
THAT
UNBAPTISED
INFANTS
WILL
GO
TO
HELL
ITS
VERY
EASY
FOR
JUST
ABOUT
ANYONE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
PARTIAL
LIST
OF
SCRIPTURE
TO
SUPPORT
ANY
SORT
OF
WRONG
DOCTRINE
HOWEVER
IF
WE
HAVE
THE
HEART
TO
PERSEVERE
IN
OUR
BELIEFS
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THEY
ARE
BIBLICALLY
BASED
THEN
WE
CAN
COME
TO
AN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
TRUTH
LETS
NOW
TAKE
A
MORE
COMPLETE
LOOK
AT
SCRIPTURE
COLOSSIANS
IN
HIM
YOU
WERE
ALSO
CIRCUMCISED
IN
THE
PUTTING
OFF
OF
THE
SINFUL
NATURE
NOT
WITH
A
CIRCUMCISION
DONE
BY
CHRIST
HAVING
BEEN
BURIED
WITH
HIM
IN
BAPTISM
AND
RAISED
WITH
HIM
THROUGH
YOUR
FAITH
IN
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
WHO
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD
IN
BAPTISM
WE
ARE
RAISED
TO
A
NEW
LIFE
IN
CHRIST
ROMANS
THROUGH
A
PERSONAL
FAITH
IN
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
OUR
PARENTS
FAITH
CANNOT
DO
THIS
DO
INFANTS
HAVE
FAITH
LETS
LOOK
AT
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
HAS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
IT
ROMANS
BUT
NOT
ALL
THE
ISRAELITES
ACCEPTED
THE
GOOD
NEWS
FOR
ISAIAH
SAYS
LORD
WHO
HAS
BELIEVED
OUR
MESSAGE
CONSEQUENTLY
FAITH
COMES
FROM
HEARING
THE
MESSAGE
AND
THE
MESSAGE
IS
HEARD
THROUGH
THE
WORD
OF
CHRIST
SO
THEN
WE
RECEIVE
GODS
GIFT
OF
FAITH
TO
US
AS
WE
HEAR
THE
MESSAGE
OF
THE
GOSPEL
FAITH
IS
A
POSSIBLE
RESPONSE
TO
HEARING
GODS
WORD
PREACHED
KIDS
ARE
NOT
YET
SPIRITUALLY
INTELLECTUALLY
OR
EMOTIONALLY
MATURE
ENOUGH
TO
RESPOND
TO
GODS
WORD
HENCE
THEY
CANNOT
HAVE
FAITH
AND
THEREFORE
CANNOT
BE
RAISED
IN
BAPTISM
TO
A
NEW
LIFE
EZEKIEL
THE
SOUL
WHO
SINS
WILL
DIE
THE
SON
WILL
NOT
SHARE
THE
GUILT
OF
THE
FATHER
NOR
WILL
THE
FATHER
SHARE
THE
GUILT
OF
THE
SON
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS
MAN
WILL
BE
CREDITED
TO
HIM
AND
THE
WICKEDNESS
OF
THE
WICKED
WILL
BE
CHARGED
AGAINST
HIM
IF
YOU
READ
ALL
OF
EZEKIEL
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
GOD
DOESNT
HOLD
US
GUILTY
FOR
ANYONE
ELSES
SINS
SO
WE
CAN
HAVE
NO
ORIGINAL
GUILT
FROM
ADAM
EZEKIEL
RID
YOURSELVES
OF
ALL
THE
OFFENSES
YOU
HAVE
COMMITTTED
AND
GET
A
NEW
HEART
AND
A
NEW
SPIRIT
WHY
WILL
YOU
DIE
O
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
FOR
I
TAKE
NO
PLEASURE
IN
THE
DEATH
OF
ANYONE
DECLARES
THE
SOVEREIGN
LORD
REPENT
AND
LIVE
THE
WAY
TO
PLEASE
GOD
IS
TO
REPENT
AND
GET
A
NEW
HEART
AND
SPIRIT
KIDS
CANNOT
DO
THIS
ACTS
SAYS
THAT
WHEN
WE
REPENT
AND
ARE
BAPTIZED
WE
WILL
THEN
RECEIVE
A
NEW
SPIRIT
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THEN
WE
SHALL
LIVE
NOW
THEN
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
LITTLE
MORE
BACKGROUND
AS
TO
WHY
ORIGINAL
SIN
IS
NOT
BIBLICAL
LETS
LOOK
AT
SOME
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
USED
TO
SUPPORT
IT
ROMANS
THEREFORE
JUST
AS
SIN
ENTERED
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
ONE
MAN
AND
DEATH
THROUGH
SIN
AND
IN
THIS
WAY
DEATH
CAME
TO
ALL
MEN
BECAUSE
ALL
SINNED
SIN
AND
DEATH
ENTERED
THE
WORLD
WHEN
THE
FIRST
MAN
SINNED
DEATH
CAME
TO
EACH
MAN
BECAUSE
EACH
MAN
SINNED
NOTE
THAT
ITS
GOOD
TO
READ
THROUGH
ALL
OF
ROMANS
SOME
OF
THE
VERSES
ARE
EASIER
TO
MISUNDERSTAND
THAN
OTHERS
BUT
IF
WE
READ
THEM
IN
CONTEXT
WE
WILL
SEE
THAT
THEY
ARE
ALL
SAYING
BASICALLY
THE
SAME
THING
LETS
LOOK
AT
ONE
SUCH
ROMANS
FOR
JUST
AS
THROUGH
THE
DISOBEDIENCE
OF
THE
ONE
MAN
THE
MANY
WERE
MADE
SINNERS
SO
ALSO
THROUGH
THE
OBEDIENCE
OF
THE
ONE
MAN
THE
MANY
WILL
BE
MADE
RIGHTEOUS
THROUGH
THE
DISOBEDIENCE
OF
EACH
INDIVIDUAL
EACH
WAS
MADE
A
SINNER
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
THROUGH
THE
OBEDIENCE
OF
JESUS
EACH
WILL
BE
MADE
RIGHTEOUS
WE
MUST
REMEMBER
WHEN
READING
THROUGH
THIS
PASSAGE
THAT
DEATH
CAME
TO
EACH
MAN
ONLY
BECAUSE
EACH
MAN
SINNED
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
GUILT
FROM
ADAM
OTHERWISE
THE
BIBLE
WOULD
CONTRADICT
ITSELF
I
ENCOURAGE
YOU
TO
READ
THROUGH
THIS
WHOLE
PASSAGE
ON
YOUR
OWN
LOOKING
AT
IT
FROM
THIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
TO
SEE
IF
IT
DOESNT
ALL
FIT
TOGETHER
PSALM
SURELY
I
WAS
SINFUL
AT
BIRTH
SINFUL
FROM
THE
TIME
MY
MOTHER
CONCEIVED
ME
THIS
WHOLE
PSALM
IS
A
WONDERFUL
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
WE
SHOULD
HUMBLE
OURSELVES
BEFORE
GOD
IN
REPENTANCE
FOR
SINNING
DAVID
HIMSELF
WAS
A
MAN
AFTER
GODS
OWN
HEART
AND
WROTE
THE
PSALM
AFTER
COMMITTING
ADULTRY
WITH
BATHSHEBA
AND
MURDERING
HER
HUSBAND
ALL
THAT
DAVID
IS
SAYING
HERE
IS
THAT
HE
CANT
REMEMBER
A
TIME
WHEN
HE
WASNT
SINFUL
HE
IS
HUMBLING
HIMSELF
BEFORE
GOD
BY
CONFESSING
HIS
SINFULNESS
HIS
SAYING
THAT
HE
WAS
SINFUL
AT
BIRTH
IS
A
HYPERBOLE
THE
BIBLE
BEING
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
ISNT
LIMITED
TO
A
LITERAL
INTERPETATION
BUT
ALSO
USES
FIGURES
OF
SPEECH
AS
DID
JESUS
JOHN
FOR
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
OF
HYPERBOLE
SEE
LUKE
NOW
THEN
EVEN
THOUGH
PEOPLE
SEE
THAT
BAPTISM
REQUIRES
FAITH
AND
THAT
ORIGINAL
SIN
IS
NOT
BIBLICAL
THEY
WILL
STILL
ARGUE
THAT
INFANT
BAPTISM
IS
NECESSARY
BECAUSE
CHILDREN
SIN
BY
BEING
SELFISH
NOT
SHARING
TOYS
WITH
OTHER
CHILDREN
BY
BEING
MEAN
HITTING
OTHERS
AND
FIGHTING
ETC
CERTAINLY
WE
HAVE
OBSERVED
CHILDREN
DOING
WRONG
THINGS
BUT
MY
GUT
FEELING
IS
ALWAYS
THAT
THEY
DONT
KNOW
ANY
BETTER
LETS
LOOK
TO
SEE
IF
THE
BIBLE
AGREES
WITH
MY
GUT
FEELINGS
ISAIAH
THEREFORE
THE
LORD
HIMSELF
WILL
GIVE
YOU
A
SIGN
THE
VIRGIN
WILL
BE
WITH
CHILD
AND
WILL
GIVE
BIRTH
TO
A
SON
AND
WILL
CALL
HIM
IMMANUEL
HE
WILL
EAT
CURDS
AND
HONEY
WHEN
HE
KNOWS
ENOUGH
TO
REJECT
THE
WRONG
AND
CHOOSE
THE
RIGHT
NOW
JUST
ABOUT
ANY
CHURCH
LEADER
WILL
TELL
YOU
THAT
THIS
IS
A
PROPHECY
ABOUT
JESUS
IF
THEY
DONT
THEN
POINT
THEM
TO
MATTHEW
AND
FIND
A
NEW
LEADER
JESUS
CERTAINLY
COULDNT
HAVE
HAD
LESS
KNOWLEDGE
THAN
NORMAL
HUMAN
BABIES
YET
THIS
PASSAGE
SAYS
THAT
HE
HAD
TO
MATURE
TO
A
CERTAIN
EXTENT
BEFORE
HE
WOULD
KNOW
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
RIGHT
AND
WRONG
WE
SEE
THAT
HE
DID
GROW
AND
BECOME
WISER
IN
LUKE
AND
THE
IMPLICATION
IS
THAT
JESUS
DID
WRONG
THINGS
AS
A
CHILD
BEFORE
HE
KNEW
TO
CHOOSE
RIGHT
OVER
WRONG
SINCE
WE
KNOW
THAT
JESUS
WAS
PERFECT
WITHOUT
SIN
WE
HAVE
RATHER
CONCLUSIVE
PROOF
THAT
BABIES
CANNOT
SIN
BECAUSE
THEY
DONT
KNOW
TO
CHOOSE
THE
RIGHT
INSTEAD
OF
THE
WRONG
JESUS
HIMSELF
WAS
BAPTIZED
ALBEIT
WITH
JOHNS
BAPTISM
NOT
AS
AN
INFANT
BUT
AS
A
THIRTYYEAROLD
MAN
LUKE
AND
STARTED
HIS
MINISTRY
AS
SOON
AS
HE
WAS
BAPTIZED
LUKE
IMMEDIATELY
AFTERWARDS
HE
WAS
TEMPTED
BY
THE
DEVIL
LUKE
MATTHEW
MARK
THANK
YOU
FOR

MODERATOR
THIS
SHOULD
FINISH
UP
THE

FOR
A

PERHAPS
YOU
WOULD

THAT
YOU

SINCERELY
AARON
CARDENAS
AARONCATHENAMITEDU
I
THINK
YOURE
OVERLY
OPTIMISTIC
ABOUT
THE
AUTHORITATIVE
QUALITY
OF
YOUR
RESPONSE
FIRST
ORIGINAL
SIN
IS
NOT
A
CATHOLICONLY
DOCTRINE
IT
WAS
HELD
BY
LUTHER
AND
CALVIN
AS
WELL
AND
IS
STILL
PRESENT
IN
ONE
FORM
OR
ANOTHER
IN
THE
LUTHERAN
AND
REFORMED
TRADITIONS
SECOND
SAYING
THAT
IT
HAS
NO
OTHER
PURPOSE
THAN
DEFENDING
INFANT
BAPTISM
IS
AN
AD
HOMINEM
ARGUMENT
WHICH
HAS
CONSIDERABLE
EVIDENCE
AGAINST
IT
THE
ORIGINAL
BAPTIST
THEOLOGY
INCLUDED
ORIGINAL
SIN
AND
SOME
BAPTISTS
STILL
HOLD
IT
AND
THERE
ARE
CERTAINLY
GROUPS
THAT
BAPTIZE
INFANTS
WITHOUT
BELIEVING
IN
ORIGINAL
SIN
AMONG
PROTESTANTS
THE
SACRAMENTS
TEND
TO
BE
A
BIT
MORE
SYMBOLIC
THAN
AMONG
CATHOLICS
PROTESTANTS
WHO
BAPTIZE
INFANTS
SEE
BAPTISM
AS
A
SIGN
OF
GODS
ACCEPTANCE
OF
US
RATHER
THAN
OUR
ACCEPTANCE
OF
GOD
IN
TRADITIONAL
PROTESTANT
THEOLOGY
GODS
GRACE
PRECEDES
OUR
RESPONSE
AND
IS
APPLICABLE
TO
CHILDREN
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
PASSAGES
ONE
CAN
CITE
TO
INDICATE
THAT
GOD
ACCEPTS
EVEN
CHILDREN
