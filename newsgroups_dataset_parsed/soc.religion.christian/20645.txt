WRITES
I
DISAGREE
WITH
YOUR
CLAIM
THAT
JEWS
WERE
NOT
EVANGELISTIC
EXCEPT
IN
THE
NARROW
SENSE
OF
THE
WORD
JEWISH
PROSELYTISM
WAS
WIDESPREAD
THERE
ARE
NUMEROUS
ACCOUNTS
OF
JEWISH
PROSELYTISM
BOTH
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
AND
IN
ROMAN
AND
GREEK
DOCUMENTS
OF
THE
DAY
JIM
PLEASE
FEEL
FREE
TO
CORRECT
ME
AND
GIVE
ME
SOME
TEXTS
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
THE
ONLY
TEXT
WHICH
VAUGELY
RELATES
TO
JEWISH
EVANGELISM
IS
FOUND
IN
MT
HOWEVER
SINCE
THIS
IS
FOUND
ONLY
IN
MT
IT
CANNOT
BE
DATED
BEFORE
WHICH
MAKES
IT
UNUSEFULL
FOR
UNDERSTANDING
SECOND
TEMPLE
JUDAISM
