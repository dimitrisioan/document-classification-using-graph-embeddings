RE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
IN
RESPONSE
TO
SOME
OF
THE
DISCUSSIONS
ON
THE
SABBATH
ANDREW
BYLER
COMMENTED
THAT
IF
WE
REALLY
FOLLOWED
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
WE
WOULD
WORSHIP
ON
SATURDAY
THE
CHANGE
TO
SUNDAY
WAS
A
LAW
MADE
BY
THE
CHURCH
AND
WE
DONT
ACKNOWLEDGE
ITS
AUTHORITY
TO
MAKE
LAWS
I
NOTED
THAT
PROTESTANTS
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
SUNDAY
WORSHIP
A
LAW
CLH
HE
WAS
NOT
REFERRING
TO
THE
FAQ
BUT
TO
THE
FIVE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
POSTED
ON
THE
BIBLE
STUDY
GROUP
THIS
IS
WHAT
PROMPTED
SOMEONE
TO
SEND
THE
FAQ
TO
ME
THE
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
THE
SABBATH
IS
THAT
IT
IS
PART
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
AND
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
THE
N
CEREMONIAL
LAW
IS
NOT
BINDING
ON
CHRISTIANS
YOU
CANNOT
SHOW
FROM
SCRIPTURE
THAT
THE
WEEKLY
SABBATH
IS
PART
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAWS
BEFORE
YOU
POST
A
TEXT
IN
REPLY
INVESTIGATE
ITS
CONTEXT
IF
YOU
ACCEPT
THAT
THE
SABBATH
IS
NOT
BINDING
ON
CHRISTIANS
THEN
THE
DAY
OF
WORSHIP
FALLS
INTO
THE
CATEGORY
OF
ITEMS
ON
WHICH
INDIVIDUAL
CHRISTIANS
OR
SINCE
WORSHIP
IS
BY
ITS
NATURE
A
GROUP
ACTIVITY
CHURCHES
ARE
FREE
TO
DECIDE
CAN
THE
CHURCHES
ALSO
DECIDE
WHAT
IS
AND
IS
NOT
SIN
INTERESTING
WHERE
THERE
IS
NO
DIVINE
IMPERATIVE
OF
COURSE
WE
MUST
ESTABLISH
RULES
OF
OPERATION
BUT
WE
CANNOT
BE
AS
CREATIVE
WITH
WHAT
GOD
HAS
EXPLICITLY
SPOKEN
ON
DARIUS
AGAIN
IN
THE
NORMAL
PROTESTANT
INTERPRETATION
SUNDAY
IS
NOT
A
LAW
AND
WORSHIPPING
ON
ANOTHER
DAY
IS
NOT
A
SIN
CHURCHES
ARE
FREE
TO
DECIDE
ON
THE
DAY
THEY
WILL
MEET
JUST
AS
THEY
ARE
FREE
TO
DECIDE
ON
THE
HOUR
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
A
SIN
TO
WORSHIP
ON
SOME
OTHER
DAY
BUT
IF
YOU
BELONG
TO
A
CHURCH
THAT
WORSHIPS
ON
SUNDAY
AND
YOU
SHOW
UP
ON
MONDAY
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
WORSHIP
ALONE
