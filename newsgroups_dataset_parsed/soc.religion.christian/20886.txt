i
am
of
the
opinion
that
you
a
saved
through
faith
alone
not
what
you
do
as
taught
in
romans
but
how
can
i
square
up
in
my
mind
the
teachings
of
james
in
conjunction
with
the
lukewarm
christian
being
spatout
if
you
agree
that
good
works
have
a
role
somewhere
you
will
generally
find
yourself
in
one
of
two
camps
faith
works
salvation
or
faith
salvation
works
either
works
are
required
for
salvation
or
faith
will
inevitably
result
in
good
works
i
am
also
of
the
opinion
that
salvation
is
by
faith
alone
based
on
ephesians
and
romans
i
also
conclude
that
james
when
read
in
context
is
teaching
bullet
above
when
james
speaks
of
justification
i
would
claim
that
he
is
not
speaking
of
god
declaring
the
believing
sinner
innocent
in
his
sight
pauls
use
of
the
word
instead
he
is
speaking
of
the
sinners
profession
of
faith
being
justified
or
proven
by
the
display
of
good
works
also
according
to
james
the
abscence
of
such
works
is
evidence
for
a
dead
or
useless
faith
which
fails
to
save
james
is
not
a
problem
for
the
doctrine
of
salvation
by
faith
if
it
is
teaching
works
would
have
their
place
not
as
merit
toward
salvation
but
as
evidence
of
true
faith
regards
dave
weaver
he
is
no
fool
who
gives
what
he
cannot
keep
to
weaverchdasicspsmotcom
gain
what
he
cannot
lose
jim
elliot
there
are
of
course
a
number
of
other
possibilities
the
reformers
believed
salvation
faith
works
some
of
us
suspect
that
the
three
things
are
tied
up
together
in
such
a
way
that
no
diagram
of
this
form
can
do
it
justice
