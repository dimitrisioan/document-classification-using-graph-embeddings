REXLEXFNALFNALGOV
WRITES
WE
CAN
JILLUSTRATE
THIS
BY
POINTING
TO
THE
WAY
GOD
ADMINISTERS
HIS
JUDGMENT
IN
THE
OT
SINS
WERE
NOT
FORGIVEN
BUT
RATHER
COVERED
UP
IN
THE
AGE
OF
THE
CHURCH
NOT
ONLY
ARE
SINS
FORGIVEN
TAKEN
AWAY
BUT
THE
POWER
OF
SIN
IS
PUT
TO
DEATH
MY
THIS
DISTINCTION
SEEMS
QUITE
ARBITRARY
BLESSED
IS
THE
MAN
WHOSE
INIQUITIES
ARE
FORGIVEN
WHOSE
SIN
IS
COVERED
PS
AND
QUOTED
BY
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
EVEN
AS
DAVID
ALSO
DESCRIBETH
THE
BLESSEDNESS
OF
THE
MAN
UNTO
WHOM
GOD
IMPUTETH
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WITHOUT
WORKS
SAYING
BLESSED
ARE
THEY
WHOSE
INIQUITIES
ARE
FORGIVEN
AND
WHOSE
SINS
ARE
COVERED
BLESSED
IS
THE
MAN
TO
WHOM
THE
LORD
WILL
NOT
IMPUTE
SIN
ROM
THE
BIBLICAL
PERSPECTIVE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
FOREGIVENESS
AND
COVERING
ARE
PARALLELEQUIVALENT
CONCEPTS
IN
BOTH
TESTAMENTS
THE
DISPENSATIONAL
DISTINCTION
IS
UNWARRANTED
DURING
THE
MILLENIUM
WE
READ
THAT
SINS
ARE
DEALT
WITH
IMMEDIATELY
UNDER
THE
PRESENT
IE
THAT
CHRIST
IS
PRESENT
ON
EARTH
RULERSHIP
OF
CHRIST
IM
SURE
REX
HAS
SCRIPTURE
TO
BACK
THIS
UP
YOURE
SUGGESTING
JESUS
IS
GOING
TO
TRAVEL
AROUND
DEALING
WITH
INDIVIDUAL
VIOLATIONS
OF
HIS
LAW
FOR
MILLIONS
PERHAPS
BILLIONS
OF
PEOPLE
SUCH
ACTIVITY
FOR
MOSES
THE
LAWGIVER
WAS
CONSIDERED
UNWISE
CF
EX
IT
MAKES
FOR
INTERESTING
SPECULATION
