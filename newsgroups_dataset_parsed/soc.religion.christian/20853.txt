RE
CERTAINTY
AND
ARROGANCE
IN
AN
EARLIER
ARTICLE
I
EXPLAINED
THAT
WHAT
MANY
PEOPLE
FIND
ARROGANT
ABOUT
CHRISTIANS
IS
THAT
SOME
CHRISTIANS
PROFESS
ABSOLUTE
CERTIANTY
ABOUT
THEIR
BELIEFS
AND
DOCTRINES
THAT
IS
MANY
CHRISTIANS
INSIST
THAT
THEY
CANNOT
HAVE
MADE
ANY
MISTAKES
WHEN
DISCOVERING
THEIR
BELIEFS
WHICH
AMOUNTS
TO
SAYING
THAT
THEY
ARE
INFALLIBLE
IMPICITLY
CLAIMING
TO
BE
INFALLIBLE
IS
PRETTY
ARROGANT
MOST
OF
US
WILL
PROBABLY
AGREE
IN
SHORT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
NO
MATTER
HOW
GOOD
YOUR
SOURCES
ARE
IF
ANY
PART
OF
YOUR
DOCTRINES
OR
BELIEFS
REST
ON
YOUR
OWN
THINKING
AND
REASONING
THEN
THOSE
DOCTRINES
ARE
SUSPECT
SO
LONG
AS
YOUR
OWN
BRAIN
IS
INVOLVED
THERE
IS
A
POSSIBILITY
FOR
ERROR
I
SUMMARISED
THE
PROBLEM
BY
WRITING
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
SOMEONE
CALLED
REXLEX
HAS
CLAIMED
THAT
THERE
IS
A
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
BOTHER
TO
EXPLAIN
WHAT
IT
WAS
PREFERRING
INSTEAD
TO
PARAPHRASE
SARTRE
RAMBLE
ABOUT
WITTGENSTEIN
AND
SAY
THAT
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
MY
ARGUMENT
LEADS
TO
RELATIVISM
AS
I
HAVE
EXPLAINED
TO
HIM
BEFORE
YOU
CANNOT
REJECT
AN
ARGUMENT
AS
FALSE
BECAUSE
YOU
DISLIKE
WHERE
IT
LEADS
THE
FACTS
DO
NOT
CHANGE
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
DISLIKE
THEM
REXLEX
WROTE
I
DISAGREE
WITH
DR
NANCYS
SWEETIES
CONCLUSION
BECAUSE
IF
IT
IS
TAKEN
TO
FRUITION
IT
LEADS
TO
RELATIVISM
WHICH
LEADS
TO
DISPAIR
HOWEVER
AS
ANY
FIRSTYEAR
PHILOSOPHY
STUDENT
CAN
EXPLAIN
WHAT
REXLEX
HAS
WRITTEN
DOES
NOT
CONSTITUTE
A
REFUTATION
ALL
HE
HAS
SAID
IS
THAT
HE
DOES
NOT
LIKE
WHAT
I
WROTE
HE
HAS
DONE
NOTHING
AT
ALL
TO
DISPUTE
IT
THERE
WERE
TWO
SENTENCES
IN
REXLEXS
POST
THAT
SEEMED
RELEVANT
TO
THE
POINT
AT
HAND
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
TRUE
TRUTH
AND
IT
IS
REAL
IT
CAN
BE
EXPERIENCED
AND
IT
IS
VERIFIABLE
I
DO
NOT
DISPUTE
THAT
SOME
TRUTHS
CAN
BE
VERIFIED
THROUGH
EXPERIENCE
I
HAVE
FOR
EXAMPLE
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
OF
ADDING
NUMBERS
I
DONT
CLAIM
TO
BE
INFALLIBLE
AT
IT
IN
FACT
I
REMEMBER
DOING
SUMS
INCORRECTLY
BUT
I
DO
CLAIM
THAT
I
HAVE
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
OF
REASONING
ABOUT
NUMBERS
HOWEVER
ONCE
WE
GO
PAST
EXPERIENCING
THINGS
AND
START
REASONING
ABOUT
THEM
WE
ARE
ON
MUCH
SHAKIER
GROUND
THAT
WAS
THE
POINT
OF
THE
EARLIER
ARTICLE
HUMAN
BRAINS
ARE
INFESTED
WITH
SIN
AND
THEY
CAN
ONLY
BE
TRUSTED
IN
VERY
LIMITED
CIRCUMSTANCES
IT
IS
ONLY
BECAUSE
OF
GODS
OWN
REVELATION
THAT
WE
CAN
BE
ABSOLUTE
ABOUT
A
THING
BUT
HOW
FAR
DOES
THAT
GET
YOU
ONCE
GODS
REVELATION
STOPS
AND
YOUR
OWN
REASONING
BEGINS
POSSIBILITY
FOR
ERROR
APPEARS
FOR
EXAMPLE
LETS
SUPPOSE
THAT
OUR
MODERN
BIBLE
TRANSLATIONS
INCLUDE
A
PERFECT
RENDERING
OF
JESUS
WORDS
AT
THE
LAST
SUPPER
AND
THAT
JESUS
SAID
EXACTLY
THIS
IS
MY
BODY
WELL
PRESUME
THAT
WHAT
HE
SAID
WAS
TOTALLY
WITHOUT
ERROR
AND
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE
WHAT
CAN
WE
BE
CERTAIN
OF
NOT
MUCH
AT
THE
MOMENT
HE
STOPS
SPEAKING
AND
PEOPLE
START
INTERPRETING
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ERROR
APPEARS
DID
HE
MEAN
THAT
LITERALLY
OR
NOT
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
RECORD
THAT
HE
ELABORATED
ON
THE
WORDS
WAS
HE
THINKING
OF
TRAN
OR
CON
SUBSTATIATION
HE
DIDNT
SAY
WE
INTERPRET
THIS
PASSAGE
USING
OUR
BRAINS
WE
THINK
AND
REASON
AND
DRAW
CONCLUSIONS
BUT
WE
KNOW
THAT
OUR
BRAINS
ARE
NOT
PERFECT
OUR
THINKING
OFTEN
LEADS
US
WRONG
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
MOST
OF
US
HAVE
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
OF
WHY
SHOULD
ANYONE
BELIEVE
THAT
HIS
REASONING
WHICH
HE
KNOWS
TO
BE
FALLIBLE
CAN
LEAD
HIM
TO
PERFECT
CONCLUSIONS
SO
GIVEN
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
IN
THIS
EXAMPLE
WHAT
WE
CAN
BE
CERTAIN
OF
IS
THAT
JESUS
SAID
THIS
IS
MY
BODY
BEYOND
THAT
ONCE
WE
START
MAKING
UP
DOCTRINES
AND
USING
OUR
BRAINS
TO
REASON
ABOUT
WHAT
CHRIST
REVEALED
WE
GET
INTO
TROUBLE
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
INFALLIBLE
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
THINGS
YOU
CAN
BE
CERTAIN
OF
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
DOCTRINES
RELY
ON
FALLIBLE
HUMAN
THINKING
THEY
CANNOT
BE
CERTAIN
THAT
IS
THE
PROBLEM
OF
SEEMING
ARROGANT
THE
NONCHRISTIANS
AROUND
US
KNOW
THAT
HUMAN
BEINGS
MAKE
MISTAKES
JUST
AS
SURELY
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
THEY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
WE
ARE
INFALLIBLE
ANY
MORE
THAN
WE
DO
WHEN
CHRISTIANS
SPEAK
AS
IF
THEY
BELIEVE
THEIR
OWN
REASONING
CAN
NEVER
LEAD
THEM
ASTRAY
WHEN
WE
IMPLICITLY
CLAIM
THAT
WE
ARE
INFALLIBLE
THE
NON
CHRISTIANS
AROUND
US
RARELY
BELIEVE
THAT
IMPLICIT
CLAIM
WITNESSING
IS
HARDLY
GOING
TO
WORK
WHEN
THE
PERSON
YOU
ARE
TALKING
TO
BELIEVES
THAT
YOU
ARE
EITHER
TOO
FOOLISH
TO
RECOGNISE
YOUR
OWN
LIMITS
OR
INTENTIONALLY
TRYING
TO
COVER
THEM
UP
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
FAR
BETTER
TO
SAY
WHAT
THINGS
WE
ARE
CERTAIN
OF
AND
WHAT
THINGS
WE
ARE
ONLY
VERY
CONFIDENT
OF
FOR
EXAMPLE
WE
MIGHT
SAY
THAT
WE
KNOW
OUR
SIN
FOR
RECOGNISING
SIN
IS
SOMETHING
WE
DIRECTLY
EXPERIENCE
BUT
OTHER
THINGS
WHETHER
BASED
ON
REASONING
FROM
SCRIPTURE
OR
EXTRABIBLICAL
THINKING
SHOULD
NOT
BE
LABLED
AS
INFALLIBLE
WE
SHOULD
SAY
THAT
WE
ARE
VERY
CONFIDENT
OF
THEM
AND
BE
READY
TO
EXPLAIN
OUR
REASONING
BUT
SO
FAR
AS
I
AM
AWARE
NONE
OF
US
IS
INFALLIBLE
SPEAKING
OR
ACTING
AS
IF
OUR
THINKING
IS
FLAWLESS
IS
RIDICULOUS
REXLEX
SUGGESTED
THAT
PEOPLE
READ
HE
IS
THERE
AND
HE
IS
NOT
SILENT
BY
FRANCIS
SCHAEFFER
I
DIDNT
THINK
VERY
HIGHLY
OF
IT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
MR
SCHAEFFER
IS
GROSSLY
OVERRATED
BY
MANY
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS
SOMEBODY
ELSE
MIGHT
LIKE
IT
THOUGH
SO
DONT
LET
MY
OPINION
STOP
YOU
FROM
READING
IT
IF
SOMEONE
IS
INTERESTED

MY
OPINION
