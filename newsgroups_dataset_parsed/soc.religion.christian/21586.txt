does
anyone
remember
some
years
ago
possibly
as
many
as
five
there
was
a
discussion
on
numerology
thats
where
you
assign
numeric
values
to
letters
and
then
add
up
the
letters
in
words
in
an
effort
to
prove
something
or
another
i
can
never
make
any
sense
of
how
its
supposed
to
work
or
what
its
supposed
to
prove
somebody
posted
a
long
article
about
numerology
in
the
bible
saying
things
like
this
proves
the
intricate
planning
of
the
scriptures
else
these
patterns
would
not
appear
then
there
was
a
brilliant
followup
which
was
about
numerology
in
all
the
other
numerology
posts
stuff
like
the
word
numerology
adds
up
to
and
the
word
appears
times
in
the
posting
such
elegant
planning
further
the
word
truth
also
adds
up
to
the
writer
is
using
these
numerological
clues
to
show
us
that
we
reach
truth
via
numerology
these
examples
are
made
up
by
me
just
as
examples
i
really
liked
that
reply
because
it
did
such
an
excellent
job
of
showing
that
these
patterns
can
be
found
in
just
about
anything
however
i
did
not
save
a
copy
of
it
i
do
not
remember
the
author
im
only
sure
that
it
was
posted
to
this
newsgroup
but
on
the
off
chance
that
somebody
remembers
it
and
saved
it
or
that
the
author
is
reading
here
i
wanted
to
know
if
anyone
could
send
me
a
copy
i
think
it
should
be
made
into
an
faq
if
we
can
find
it

use
not
only
all
the
brains
i
have
but
all
those
i
