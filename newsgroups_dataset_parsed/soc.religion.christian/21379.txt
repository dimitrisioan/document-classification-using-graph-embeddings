WRITES
THERE
IS
DIS
CREPANCY
EVEN
AMONG
CHARISMATIC
ORGANIZATIONS
AS
TO
THE
PROPER
USE
OF
TONGUES
BE
IT
REVELATORY
WITH
INTERPRETATION
FOR
PRAYER
USE
OR
FOR
SIGNIFYING
BELIEVERS
WHICH
I
DOUBT
SINCE
ANY
ONE
CAN
DO
IT
PENTECOSTALS
ASSEMBLY
OF
GOD
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
SEEM
TO
ESPOUSE
ALL
THREE
NEOPENTECOSTALS
TEND
TO
VIEW
PRAYER
USE
AND
AS
A
SIGN
AS
THE
USES
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
DURING
A
SERVICE
IS
NOT
USUALLY
DONE
BY
NEOPENTECOSTALS
BECAUSE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THEY
STILL
ATTEND
PROTESTANT
CHURCHES
NONDENOMINATIONAL
CHURCHES
SEEM
TO
VIEW
THE
USE
AS
A
SIGN
AS
MERELY
OPTIONAL
BUT
RECOMMENDED
KOBERG
JUST
A
COUPLE
OF
MINOR
CORRECTIONS
HERE
THE
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
DO
NOT
USUALLY
BELIEVE
IN
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
IN
FACT
MANY
OF
THEM
ARE
KNOWN
FOR
BEING
STRONGLY
OPPOSED
TO
PENTECOSTAL
TEACHING
YOU
ARE
PROBABLY
THINKING
OF
CHURCH
OF
GOD
IN
CHRIST
THE
LARGEST
AFRICANAMERICAN
PENTECOSTAL
DENOMINATION
IM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
SIGNIFYING
BELIEVERS
BUT
IT
SHOULD
BE
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THE
ASSEMBLIES
OF
GOD
DOES
NOT
NOW
NOR
HAS
IT
EVER
HELD
THAT
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
IS
THE
SIGN
THAT
ONE
IS
A
CHRISTIAN
THE
DOCTRINE
THAT
TRADITIONAL
PENTECOSTALS
INCLUDING
THE
AG
MAINTAIN
IS
THAT
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
IS
THE
SIGN
OF
A
SECOND
EXPERIENCE
AFTER
BECOMING
A
CHRISTIAN
IN
WHICH
ONE
IS
BAPTIZED
IN
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THAT
MAY
BE
WHAT
YOU
WERE
REFERRING
TO
BUT
I
POINT
THIS
OUT
BECAUSE
PENTECOSTALS
ARE
FREQUENTLY
LABELED
AS
BELIEVING
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
SPEAK
IN
TONGUES
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
SUCH
A
POSITION
IS
ONLY
HELD
BY
SOME
GROUPS
AND
NOT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
PENTECOSTALS
MANY
PENTECOSTALS
WILL
QUOTE
THE
PASSAGE
IN
MARK
ABOUT
THESE
SIGNS
FOLLOWING
THEM
THAT
BELIEVE
BUT
THEY
GENERALLY
DO
NOT
INTERPRET
THIS
AS
MEANING
IF
YOU
DONT
PACTICE
THE
SIGNS
YOU
ARENT
SAVED
I
KNOW
ITS
HARD
TO
SUMMARIZE
THE
BELIEFS
OF
A
MOVEMENT
THAT
HAS
SUCH
DIVERSITY
BUT
I
THINK
YOUVE
MADE
SOME
PRETTY
BIG
GENERALIZATIONS
HERE
DO
NEOPENTECOSTALS
ONLY
BELIEVE
IN
TONGUES
AS
A
SIGN
AND
TONGUES
AS
PRAYER
BUT
NOT
TONGUES
AS
REVELATORY
WITH
A
MESSAGE
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
THAT
BEFORE
IN
FACT
I
WOULD
HAVE
CHARACTERIZED
THEM
AS
BELIEVING
THE
SAME
AS
PENTECOSTALS
EXCEPT
LESS
LIKELY
TO
SEE
TONGUES
AS
A
SIGN
OF
SPIRIT
BAPTISM
ALSO
WHILE
NEOPENTECOSTALS
MAY
NOT
BE
INCLINED
TO
SPEAK
IN
TONGUES
IN
THE
NONPENTECOSTAL
CHURCHES
THEY
ATTEND
THEY
DO
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
MEETINGS
AND
IN
MANY
CASES
A
WHOLE
CHURCH
WILL
BE
CHARISMATIC
