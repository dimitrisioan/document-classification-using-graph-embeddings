WRITES
PROTESTANTS
LOVE
TO
PLAY
UP
JEROME
FOR
ALL
HE
IS
WORTH
YES
BUT
NO
MORE
THAN
HE
IS
WORTH
SERIOUSLY
JEROME
IS
MERELY
AND
GRANDLY
ANOTHER
CHRISTIAN
WITNESS
TO
BE
TAKEN
FOR
WHAT
HE
CAN
TELL
US
HE
IS
ONE
IN
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
SAINTS
YOU
SEEM
TO
WISH
FOR
A
GREATER
POLARIZATION
AND
DICHOTOMY
BETWEEN
CATHOLIC
AND
PROTESTANT
THOUGHT
THAN
SEEMS
TO
ME
FROM
A
HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE
TO
BE
VALID
TO
BE
SURE
ROME
REJECTS
SOME
SIGNIFICANT
ASPECTS
OF
PROTESTANT
THOUGHT
JUST
AS
VEHEMENTLY
AS
PROTESTANTS
REJECT
SOME
SIGNIFICANT
ASPECTS
OF
ROMAN
THOUGHT
OTHER
THAN
SOME
PEOPLW
WHO
APPARENTLY
TRY
TO
EMBODY
THE
GREATEST
EXTREME
OF
THIS
REJECTION
ON
EITHER
SIDE
THERE
IS
NOT
QUITE
SO
VAST
A
GULF
FIXED
AS
CASUAL
OBSERVERS
SEEM
TO
ASSUME
ECUMENICAL
CONSULTATIONS
BETWEEN
ROME
AND
THE
LUTHERANS
AS
WELL
AS
THOSE
BETWEEN
ROME
AND
THE
ANGLICAN
COMMUNION
TO
WHICH
I
BELONG
SHOW
VERY
NEARLY
COMPLETE
CONVERGENCE
ON
UNDERSTANDING
THE
BASIC
THEOLOGICAL
ISSUES
THE
STICKING
POINTS
TEND
TO
BE
ECCLESIOLOGY
AND
CHURCH
POLITY
THUS
FOR
EXAMPLE
AS
YOU
GO
ON
TO
SAY
THEY
SHOULD
REMEBER
THAT
AFTER
THE
DECREE
OF
POPE
ST
DAMSUS
I
MANY
OF
US
DO
NOT
REGARD
A
PAPAL
DECRETAL
AS
HAVING
ANY
NECESSARY
AS
OPPOSED
TO
POLITICAL
SIGNIFICANCE
SOMETIMES
IT
WILL
SOMETIMES
IT
WONT
YOU
MISREAD
ME
IF
YOU
THINK
THAT
MY
COMMUNION
AT
LEAST
THROWS
OUT
THE
DEUTEROCANONICAL
BOOKS
NOR
DO
I
THINK
YOU
SHOULD
OVERSTRESS
THE
SENSE
IN
WHICH
THE
MORE
REFORMED
MAY
DO
SO
AGAIN
WHY
MUST
THE
CHURCH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
ADOPT
THE
CANON
OF
THE
UNBELIEVING
JEWS
DRAWN
UP
IN
JAMNIA
IN
AD
IN
COUNTERING
THE
CHRISTIAN
USE
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
I
SERIOUSLY
SUGGEST
YOU
RETHINK
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
HERE
IT
VERGES
ON
AND
COULD
BE
TAKEN
AS
ANTISEMITIC
IN
THE
WORST
SENSE
THE
UNBELIEVING
JEWS
WERE
ACCORDING
TO
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
THE
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
OF
GOD
AND
THE
RECIPIENTS
OF
HIS
PREINCARNATIONAL
REVELATION
I
THINK
THEY
HAVE
SOME
SAY
IN
THE
MATTER
THE
JAVNEH
MEETING
SHOULD
NOT
BE
OVERINTERPRETED
A
RECENT
MAGISTERIAL
STUDY
TITLED
MIKRA
I
DONT
HAVE
MORE
CITATION
INFORMATION
ON
HAND
SORRY
PRODUCED
PRIMARILY
FROM
THE
BACKGROUND
OF
CHRISTIAN
RATHER
THAN
SPECIFICALLY
JEWISH
SCHOLARSHIP
SUGGESTS
STRONGLY
THAT
THE
JAVNEH
MEETING
MOSTLY
RESOLVED
A
LINGERING
QUESTION
WHERE
IN
PRACTICE
THE
CANON
HAD
LONG
BEEN
FIXED
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
SCROLLS
THAT
WERE
KEPT
IN
THE
TEMPLE
AND
THEREBY
MADE
THE
HANDS
UNCLEAN
WHEN
USED
THE
LIST
OF
SACRED
BOOKS
THAT
MAY
BE
DRAWN
UP
FROM
JOSEPHUS
AND
OTHER
PREYAVNEH
SOURCES
CORRESPOND
PLUS
OR
MINUS
ONE
BOOK
IF
I
REMEMEBER
THE
CHAPTER
CORRECTLY
TO
THE
CURRENT
JEWISH
CANON
OF
TANAKH
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
THROW
OUT
THE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
WHAT
BY
THE
WAY
IS
YOUR
POSITION
ABOUT
THE
BOOKS
THE
GREEKS
ACCEPT
AND
ROME
DOES
NOT
JUST
TO
OBSERVE
THAT
THE
ISSUE
IS
COMPLEX
AND
SIMPLY
BINARY
JUDGMENT
DOES
NOT
DO
IT
JUSTICE
