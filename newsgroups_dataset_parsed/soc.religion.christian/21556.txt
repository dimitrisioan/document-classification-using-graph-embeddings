RE
HOW
I
GOT
SAVED
HELLO
BRYCEN
IM
A
NORWEGIAN
JOURNALIST
STUDENT
AND
ALSO
A
CHRISTIAN
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
TESTIMONY
BUT
I
WANT
TO
ASK
YOU
ONE
QUESTION
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
OF
HEAVY
METAL
MUSIC
AFTER
YOU
BECAME
A
CHRISTIAN
YOU
KNOW
THERE
ARE
CHRISTIAN
BANDS
LIKE
BARREN
CROSS
WHITECROSS
BLOODGOOD
AND
STRYPER
THAT
PLAY
THAT
KIND
OF
MUSIC
I
LIKE
SOME
OF
IT
I
FEEL
LIKE
IT
SOMETIMES
OF
COURSE
I
LISTEN
TO
THE
LYRICS
TOO
I
DONT
LISTEN
TO
ANY
CHRISTIAN
BAND
BUT
ITS
BETTER
THAN
LISTENING
TO
SECULAR
MUSIC
ANYWAY
HOPE
YOURE
STILL
GOING
STRONG
WITH
CHRIST
