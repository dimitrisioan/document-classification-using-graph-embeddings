re
how
i
got
saved
hello
brycen
im
a
norwegian
journalist
student
and
also
a
christian
thanks
for
your
testimony
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
what
do
you
think
of
heavy
metal
music
after
you
became
a
christian
you
know
there
are
christian
bands
like
barren
cross
whitecross
bloodgood
and
stryper
that
play
that
kind
of
music
i
like
some
of
it
i
feel
like
it
sometimes
of
course
i
listen
to
the
lyrics
too
i
dont
listen
to
any
christian
band
but
its
better
than
listening
to
secular
music
anyway
hope
youre
still
going
strong
with
christ
