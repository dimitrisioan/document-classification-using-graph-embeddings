THE
COMPUTER
IS
NOT
A
FANTASYLAND
WHERE
ONES
RESPONSIBILITIES
DISAPPEAR
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
NET
ARE
REAL
SLANDER
AND
DECEPTION
CARRIED
OUT
BY
NET
ARE
JUST
AS
WRONG
AS
THEY
WOULD
BE
IF
CARRIED
OUT
ON
PAPER
OR
FACE
TO
FACE
WELL
SAID
MICHAEL
THE
CATHOLIC
TRADITON
HAS
A
LIST
OF
BEHAVIOURS
CALLED
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORKS
OF
MERCY
ADMONISH
THE

INSTRUCT
THE
IGNORANT
COUNSEL
THE
DOUBTFUL
COMFORT
THE
SORROWFUL
BEAR
WRONGS
PATIENTLY
FORGIVE
ALL

PRAY
FOR
THE

YES
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
SOME
CONTROVERSY
ON
THIS
AND
I
DONT
WANT
TO
ARGUE
ABOUT
IT
THESE
ARE
ALL
THINGS
THAT
HAVE
A
DIRECT
APPLICATION
TO
USENET
PEOPLE
ASK
QUESTIONS
AND
EXPRESS
DOUBTS
SOME
ARE
IN
NEED
OF
COMFORT
OR
PRAYERS
IMAGINE
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
TO
FLAME
WARS
IF
WE
BORE
WRONGS
PATIENTLY
AND
FORGAVE
INJURIES
I
WOULD
ADD
THAT
IT
IS
PROBABLY
MORE
APPROPRIATE
TO
DO
ANY
ADMONISHING
