RE
AN
AGNOSTICS
QUESTION
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
TELL
YOUR
FRIEND
THAT
YOU
FEEL
PRESSURED
BY
HIS
CONTINUAL
DISCUSSIONS
OF
THIS
TOPIC
SURELY
HE
DOESNT
FEEL
YOU
SHOULD
BE
PRESSURED
INTO
SOMETHING
YOU
FEEL
UNCOMFORTABLE
ABOUT
SINCE
CHRISTIANITY
SHOULD
BE
A
CHOICE
ONE
SHOULD
MAKE
ON
ONES
OWN
PLEASE
ALSO
REALIZE
THAT
HE
IS
DOING
THIS
OUT
OF
FRIENDSHIP
HE
PROBABLY
FEELS
YOU
ARE
MISSING
OUT
ON
SOMETHING
GREAT
AND
WANTS
TO
TELL
YOU
ABOUT
IT
BUT
SINCE
YOU
KNOW
WHERE
YOU
CAN
LEARN
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
YOU
CAN
TELL
HIM
THAT
IT
IS
NOW
UP
TO
YOU
TO
MAKE
THAT
CHOICE
AND
IF
THE
CHOICE
IS
NO
YOU
SHOULD
BE
RESPECTED
FOR
THAT
PERSONALLY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
A
CHRISTIANS
MISSION
IS
JUST
TO
BE
CHRISTLIKE
SHOWING
HISHER
OWN
FAITH
AND
HAPPINESS
IN
THAT
FAITH
AND
MAKE
SURE
PEOPLE
KNOW
THEY
ARE
WELCOME
TO
TALK
TO
YOU
ABOUT
IT
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
IMPOSING
YOUR
BELIEFS
UPON
OTHERS
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
EVERYONES
DEFINITIONS
OF
IMPOSING
MAY
DIFFER
I
HOPE
I
HAVE
MADE
MYSELF
CLEAR
IF
NOT
PLEASE
CORRECT
ME
