WRITES
NORRISATHENAMITEDU
WRITES
SOME
STUFF
DELETED
FORTUNATELY
FOR
THE
CONVENIENCE
OF
US
BELIEVERS
THERE
IS
A
CLASS
OF
QUESTIONS
THAT
CAN
NEVER
BE
REDUCED
AWAY
BY
NATURAL
SCIENCE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
MUST
THERE
BE
A
WHY
TO
THIS
I
ASK
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
YOU
ALSO
ASSUME
ABOUT
GOD
NAMELY
THAT
HE
JUST
EXISTS
WITH
NO
WHY
TO
HIS
EXISTENCE
SO
THE
QUESTION
IS
REVERSED
WHY
CANT
WE
ASSUME
THE
UNIVERSE
JUST
EXISTS
AS
YOU
ASSUME
GOD
TO
JUST
EXIST
WHY
MUST
THERE
BE
A
WHY
TO
THE
UNIVERSE
REMAINDER
OF
MESSAGE
DELETED
PARDON
ME
FOR
REPLYING
TO
ONLY
A
PORTION
OF
YOUR
MESSAGE
THE
REASON
WE
CAN
SAY
GOD
JUST
EXISTS
AND
CANT
SAY
THE
UNIVERSE
JUST
EXISTS
IS
BECAUSE
THE
UNIVERSE
IS
A
NATURAL
REALM
AND
IS
SUBJECT
TO
NATURAL
LAWS
IN
GENERAL
AND
THE
LAW
OF
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
IN
PARTICULAR
THAT
IS
WE
OBSERVE
IN
NATURE
THAT
EVERY
CAUSE
HAS
AN
EFFECT
AND
EVERY
EFFECT
WAS
PRODUCED
BY
A
CAUSE
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
NATURAL
REALM
AS
AN
EFFECT
ITSELF
CANNOT
BE
ITS
OWN
CAUSE
IT
MUST
THEREFORE
HAVE
A
SUPERNATURAL
CAUSE
GOD
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
A
SUPERNATURAL
BEING
AND
IS
THEREFORE
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
SUCH
NATURAL
LAWS
AS
THE
LAW
OF
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
AS
A
SUPERNATURAL
BEING
GODS
ETERNAL
EXISTENCE
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
A
PREVIOUS
CAUSE
THE
WAY
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
PHYSICAL
NATURAL
COSMOS
DOES
THUS
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
SUPERNATURAL
HAVE
A
VALID
BASIS
FOR
ACCEPTING
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
UNCAUSED
PHENOMENA
SUCH
AS
THE
ETERNAL
GOD
WHEREAS
THOSE
WHO
DENY
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
SUPERNATURAL
ARE
FACED
WITH
THE
DILEMMA
OF
A
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
WHOSE
VERY
NATURE
SHOWS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
TO
EXPLAIN
ITS
OWN
EXISTENCE
THIS
IS
OF
COURSE
AN
OVERSIMPLIFICATION
OF
A
COMPLEX
TOPIC
BUT
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
CLARIFY
SOME
IMPORTANT
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
SUPERNATURAL
GOD
AND
THE
NATURAL
THE
UNIVERSE
SINCE
YOU
SEEM
TO
MISTAKE
THEM
AS
BEING
INTERCHANGEABLE
MARK
