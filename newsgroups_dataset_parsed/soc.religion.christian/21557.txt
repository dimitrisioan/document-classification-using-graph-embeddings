RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
IN
ARTICLE
EUGENEBIGELOWEBAYSUNCOM
WRITES
AS
ST
AUGUSTINE
SAID
I
DID
NOT
INVENT
ORIGINAL
SIN
WHICH
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
HOLDS
FROM
ANCIENT
TIME
BUT
YOU
WHO
DENY
IT
WITHOUT
A
DOUBT
ARE
A
FOLLOWER
OF
A
NEW
HERESY
DE
NUPTIIS
LIB
WHY
IS
IT
FAIR
TO
PUNISH
YOU
ME
AND
THE
REST
OF
HUMANITY
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
ADAM
AND
EVE
DID
SUPPOSE
YOUR
PARENTS
COMMITTED
SOME
CRIME
BEFORE
YOU
WERE
BORN
AND
ONE
DAY
THE
COPS
COME
TO
YOUR
DOOR
AND
THROW
YOU
IN
JAIL
FOR
IT
WOULD
YOU
REALLY
THINK
THAT
IS
FAIR
I
KNOW
I
WOULDNT
YOU
MAY
NOT
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
FAIR
BUT
HOW
MANY
SINS
DO
YOU
KNOW
OF
THAT
AFFECT
ONLY
THE
SINNER
IS
IT
FAIR
FOR
US
EVEN
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
INTO
HEAVEN
DO
WE
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
HEAVEN
EVEN
IF
WE
WERE
TO
LEAD
SINLESS
LIVES
ANYWAY
YOUR
ARGUMENT
SEEMS
TO
BE
SAYING
IF
I
WERE
GOD
I
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
DO
THINGS
THAT
WAY
THEREFORE
GOD
DOESNT
DO
THINGS
THAT
WAY
ISAIAH
FOR
MY
THOUGHTS
ARE
NOT
YOUR
THOUGHTS
NEITHER
ARE
YOUR
WAYS
MY
WAYS
SAITH
THE
LORD
FOR
AS
THE
HEAVENS
ARE
HIGHER
THAN
THE
EARTH
SO
ARE
MY
WAYS
HIGHER
THAN
YOUR
WAYS
AND
MY
THOUGHTS
THAN
YOUR
THOUGHTS
ORIGINAL
SIN
IS
BIBLICAL
ROMANS
WHEREFORE
AS
BY
ONE
MAN
SIN
ENTERED
INTO
THE
WORLD
AND
DEATH
BY
SIN
AND
SO
DEATH
PASSED
UPON
ALL
MEN
FOR
THAT
ALL
HAVE
SINNED
FOR
UNTIL
THE
LAW
SIN
WAS
IN
THE
WORLD
BUT
SIN
IS
NOT
IMPUTED
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
NEVERTHELESS
DEATH
REIGNED
FROM
ADAM
TO
MOSES
EVEN
OVER
THEM
THAT
HAD
NOT
SINNED
AFTER
THE
SIMILITUDE
OF
ADAMS
TRANSGRESSION
WHO
IS
THE
FIGURE
OF
HIM
THAT
WAS
TO
COME
CORINTHIANS
FOR
AS
IN
ADAM
ALL
DIE
EVEN
SO
IN
CHRIST
SHALL
ALL
BE
MADE
ALIVE
