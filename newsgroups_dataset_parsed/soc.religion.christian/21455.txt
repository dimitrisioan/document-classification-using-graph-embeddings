RE
IF
THERE
WERE
NO
HELL
OFM
COMMENTS
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
IS
THAT
JESUS
DOES
USE
HELL
AS
A
THREAT
HE
DOESNT
SOUND
LIKE
SOME
OF
THE
MORE
EXTREME
FIRE
AND
BRIMSTONE
PREACHERS
AND
I
DONT
THINK
HE
WANTS
PEOPLE
TO
LIVE
IN
ABJECT
FEAR
BUT
HE
TALKS
A
LOT
ABOUT
PEOPLE
BEING
FOUND
UNWORTHY
AND
MENTIONS
HELL
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
I
AGREE
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
MORE
PLEASANT
TO
THINK
THAT
IT
DOESNT
EXIST
I
CERTAINLY
DONT
AGREE
THAT
GOD
IS
SOME
SORT
OF
SADIST
WHO
TORTURES
PEOPLE
FOREVER
BUT
I
AM
VERY
MUCH
AFRAID
THAT
THERE
REALLY
IS
A
LIFE
AND
DEATH
SPIRITUAL
STRUGGLE
GOING
ON
AND
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
LOSE
IN
A
SERIOUS
WAY
CLH
NO
DISAGREEMENT
AT
ALL
THAT
THERE
IS
A
VERY
SERIOUS
STRUGGLE
GOING
ON
BUT
JESUS
MORE
TYPICALLY
USES
CONSEQUENCES
AS
A
THREAT
THATS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
HELL
CLASSIC
TM
JESUS
DOESNT
SOUND
LIKE
THE
USUAL
HELLFIRE
TYPE
OF
PREACHER
HE
ATTRACTS
PEOPLE
THROUGH
WHAT
HE
DOES
AND
THE
STONGEST
EXAMPLE
IN
JESUS
PREACHING
IS
IN
THE
PARABLE
OF
LAZARUS
AND
DIVES
WHICH
IS
A
PARABLE
IN
ANY
CASE
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
A
FEARBASED
RESPONSE
TO
CHRIST
IS
NOT
A
FREEING
LIFEAFFIRMING
CHOICE
AND
ISNT
GOOD
NEWS
IN
A
MEANINGFUL
SENSE
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
GOOD
REASONS
TO
FOLLOW
JESUS
THAT
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
FEAR
OR
A
LITERAL
HELL
THAT
STILL
PERTAIN
TO
OVERCOMING
IN
THE
PRESENT
STRUGGLE
BETWEEN
GOD
AND
THE
DISLOYAL
OPPOSITION
A
FAITH
BASED
IN
FEAR
IS
NOT
BUILT
ON
ROCK
AS
WE
SHOULD
FOUND
OUR
FAITH
BUT
ON
ICE
IF
THE
FEAR
WERE
REMOVED
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
FOUNDATION
THATS
BASICALLY
WHY
IT
MATTERS
TO
ME
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
MANY
CHRISTIANS
THAT
DONT
HAVE
A
SOLID
BASIS
FOR
RELATING
TO
THE
LIVING
INCARNATE
GOD
I
CANNOT
BE
FULLY
OPEN
TO
THE
WORKING
OF
GOD
IN
AND
THROUGH
MY
LIFE
IF
MY
RESPONSE
TO
GOD
IS
MOTIVATED
ON
FEAR
