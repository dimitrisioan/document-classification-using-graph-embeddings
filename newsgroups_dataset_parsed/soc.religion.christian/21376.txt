IF
YOU
ARE
USING
THE
STANDARD
FORMULA
OF
FULLY
GOD
AND
FULLY
HUMAN
THAT
IM
NOT
SURE
WHY
YOU
OBJECT
TO
SAYING
THAT
JESUS
WAS
HUMAN
I
THINK
THE
USUAL
ANALYSIS
WOULD
BE
THAT
SIN
IS
NOT
PART
OF
THE
BASIC
DEFINITION
OF
HUMANITY
ITS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
FALL
JESUS
IS
HUMAN
BUT
NOT
A
FALLEN
HUMAN
CLH
I
DIFFER
WITH
OUR
MODERATOR
ON
THIS
I
THOUGHT
THE
WHOLE
IDEA
OF
GOD
COMING
DOWN
TO
EARTH
TO
LIVE
AS
ONE
OF
US
SUBJECT
TO
SIN
AND
DEATH
AS
ONE
OF
THE
CONSECRATION
PRAYERS
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
COMMON
PRAYER
PUTS
IT
WAS
THAT
JESUS
WAS
TEMPTED
BUT
DID
NOT
SUCCUMB
IF
SIN
IS
NOT
PART
OF
THE
BASIC
DEFINITION
OF
HUMANITY
THEN
JESUS
FULLY
HUMAN
NICEA
WOULD
NOT
BE
SUBJECT
TO
SIN
BUT
THEN
THE
RESURRECTION
LOSES
SOME
OF
ITS
MEANING
BECAUSE
WE
ENCOUNTER
OUR
HUMANITY
MOST
POWERFULLY
WHEN
WE
SIN
TO
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
HUMAN
AND
FALLEN
HUMAN
MAKES
JESUS
LESS
LIKE
ONE
OF
US
AT
THE
TIME
WE
NEED
HIM
MOST
THESE
ISSUES
GET
MIGHTY
SUBTLE
WHEN
YOU
SEE
PEOPLE
SAYING
DIFFERENT
THINGS
ITS
OFTEN
HARD
TO
TELL
WHETHER
THEY
REALLY
MEAN
SERIOUSLY
DIFFERENT
THINGS
OR
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
USING
DIFFERENT
TERMINOLOGY
I
DONT
THINK
THERES
ANY
QUESTION
THAT
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
NESTORIUS
AND
I
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
THE
SAYING
CHRIST
HAD
A
HUMAN
FORM
WITHOUT
A
REAL
HUMAN
NATURE
OR
WILL
IS
HERETICAL
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
A
BIT
WARY
ABOUT
THE
COPTS
ARMENIANS
ETC
RECENT
DISCUSSIONS
SUGGEST
THAT
THEIR
MONOPHYSITE
POSITION
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
FAR
FROM
ORTHODOXY
AS
MANY
HAD
THOUGHT
NESTORIUS
WAS
AN
EXTREME
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
MAJOR
SCHOOLS
OF
THOUGHT
MORE
MODERATE
REPRESENTATIVES
WERE
REGARDED
AS
ORTHODOX
EG
THEODORE
OF
MOPSUESTIA
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
THE
MODERN
MONOPHYSITE
GROUPS
INHERIT
THE
ENTIRE
TRADITION
NOT
JUST
NESTORIUS
VERSION
AND
THAT
SOME
OF
THEM
MAY
HAVE
A
SUFFICIENT
BALANCED
POSITION
TO
BE
REGARDED
AS
ORTHODOX
CLH
FIRST
THE
MONOPHYSITES
INHERITED
NONE
OF
NESTORIUSS
VERSION
THEY
WERE
ON
THE
OPPOSITE
END
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
FROM
HIM
SECOND
THE
HISTORICAL
RECORD
SUGGESTS
THAT
THE
POSITIONS
ATTRIBUTED
TO
NESTORIUS
WERE
NOT
AS
EXTREME
AS
HIS
SUCCESSFUL
OPPONENTS
WHO
WROTE
THE
CONVENTIONAL
HISTORY
CLAIMED
MAINLY
NESTORIUS
OPPOSED
THE
TERM
THEOTOKOS
FOR
MARY
ARGUING
I
THINK
CORRECTLY
THAT
A
HUMAN
COULD
NOT
BE
CALLED
MOTHER
OF
GOD
I
MEAN
IN
THE
ATHANASIAN
CREED
WE
TALK
ABOUT
THE
SON
UNCREATE
SURELY
EVEN
ARIANS
WOULD
CONCEDE
THAT
JESUS
EXISTED
LONG
BEFORE
MARY
ANYWAY
NESTORIUSS
OPPONENTS
CLAIMED
THAT
BY
SAYING
MARY
WAS
NOT
THEOTOKOS
THAT
HE
CLAIMED
THAT
SHE
ONLY
GAVE
BIRTH
TO
THE
HUMAN
NATURE
OF
JESUS
WHICH
WOULD
REQUIRE
TWO
SEPERATE
AND
DISTINCT
NATURES
THE
ARGUMENT
FAILS
THOUGH
BECAUSE
MARY
SIMPLY
GAVE
BIRTH
TO
JESUS
WHO
PREEXISTED
HER
EITHER
DIVINELY
IF
YOU
ACCEPT
NESTORIANISM
AS
COMMONLY
DEFINED
OR
BOTH
NATURES
INTERTWINED
A
LA
CHALCEDON
SECOND
I
AM
NOT
SURE
THAT
NESTORIANISM
IS
NOT
A
BETTER
ALTERNATIVE
THAN
THE
ORTHODOX
VIEW
AFTER
ALL
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
PREINCARNATION
THAT
JESUSS
HUMAN
NATURE
WAS
IN
HEAVEN
LIKEWISE
POSTASCENSION
I
THINK
RATHER
THAT
GOD
CAME
TO
EARTH
AND
TOOK
OUR
NATURE
UPON
HIM
IT
WAS
A
SEPERATE
NATURE
CAPABLE
OF
BEING
TEMPTED
AS
IN
GETHSEMANE
SINCE
I
BELIEVE
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
COULD
NEVER
BE
TEMPTED
BUT
IN
ITS
MOMENTS
OF
WEAKNESS
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
PREVAILED
COMMENTS
ON
THE
ABOVE
WARMLY
APPRECIATED
JASON
ALBERT
THERE
MAY
BE
DIFFERENCES
IN
WHAT
WE
MEAN
BY
SUBJECT
TO
SIN
THE
ORIGINAL
COMPLAINT
WAS
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
DIDNT
SEE
HOW
WE
COULD
CALL
JESUS
FULLY
HUMAN
BECAUSE
HE
DIDNT
SIN
I
COMPLETELY
AGREE
THAT
JESUS
WAS
SUBJECT
TO
TEMPTATION
I
SIMPLY
OBJECT
TO
THE
IDEA
THAT
BY
NOT
SUCCUMBING
HE
IS
THEREBY
NOT
FULLY
HUMAN
I
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
SIN
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
HUMAN
I
AGAIN
APOLOGIZE
FOR
CONFUSING
NESTORIANISM
AND
MONOPHYSITISM
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
AND
HAVE
SAID
ELSEWHERE
THAT
THERES
REASON
TO
THINK
THAT
NOT
EVERYONE
WHO
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
HERETICAL
POSITIONS
WAS
IN
FACT
HERETICAL
THERE
ARE
SCHOLARS
WHO
MAINTAIN
THAT
NESTORIUS
WAS
NOT
NESTORIAN
I
HAVE
TO
CONFESS
THAT
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
READ
SOME
OF
THE
CORRESPONDENCE
BETWEEN
NESTORIUS
AND
HIS
OPPONENTS
I
THOUGHT
HE
GOT
THE
BETTER
OF
THEM
HOWEVER
MOST
SCHOLARS
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
WORK
THAT
EVENTUALLY
LED
TO
CHALCEDON
WAS
AN
ADVANCE
AND
THAT
NESTORIUS
WAS
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
RASH
AND
DOGMATIC
AS
THE
EDITOR
OF
THE
CHRISTOLOGICAL
CONTROVERSY
REFERS
TO
HIM
IN
REJECTING
ALL
APPROACHES
OTHER
THAN
HIS
OWN
AS
REGULAR
USENET
READERS
KNOW
NARROWNESS
CAN
BE
JUST
AS
MUCH
AN
IMPEDIMENT
AS
BEING
WRONG
FURTHERMORE
HE
DID
SAY
SOME
THINGS
THAT
I
THINK
ARE
PROBLEMATICAL
HE
RESPONDS
TO
A
RATHER
MILD
LETTER
FROM
CYRIL
WITH
A
FLAME
WORTHY
OF
USENET
IN
IT
HE
SAYS
TO
ATTRIBUTE
ALSO
TO
THE
LOGOS
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
INCARNATION
THE
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
FLESH
THAT
HAS
BEEN
CONJOINED
WITH
HIM
IS
MY
BROTHER
EITHER
THE
WORK
OF
A
MIND
WHICH
TRULY
ERRS
IN
THE
FASHION
OF
THE
GREEKS
OR
THAT
OF
A
MIND
DISEASED
WITH
THE
INSANE
HERESY
OF
ARIUS
AND
APOLLINARIS
AND
THE
OTHERS
THOSE
WHO
ARE
THUS
CARRIED
AWAY
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
THIS
ASSOCIATION
ARE
BOUND
BECAUSE
OF
IT
TO
MAKE
THE
DIVINE
LOGOS
HAVE
A
PART
IN
BEING
FED
WITH
MILK
AND
PARTICIPATE
TO
SOME
DEGREE
IN
GROWH
AND
STAND
IN
NEED
OF
ANGELIC
ASSISTANCE
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
FEARFULNESS
THESE
THINGS
ARE
TAKEN
FALSELY
WHEN
THEY
ARE
PUT
OFF
ON
THE
DEITY
AND
THEY
BECOME
THE
OCCASION
OF
JUST
CONDEMNATION
FOR
US
WHO
PERPETRATE
THE
FALSEHOOD
ITS
ALL
WELL
AND
GOOD
TO
MAINTAIN
A
PROPER
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
HUMANITY
AND
DIVINITY
BUT
THE
WHOLE
CONCEPT
OF
INCARNATION
IS
BASED
ON
EXACTLY
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
DIVINE
LOGOS
DOES
IN
FACT
HAVE
TO
SOME
DEGREE
A
PART
IN
BEING
BORN
GROWING
UP
AND
DYING
OF
COURSE
IT
MUST
BE
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THERES
A
CERTAIN
INDIRECTNESS
IN
THE
LOGOS
PARTICIPATION
IN
THESE
THINGS
BUT
THERE
MUST
BE
SOME
SORT
OF
IDENTIFICATION
BETWEEN
THE
DIVINE
AND
HUMAN
OR
WE
DONT
HAVE
AN
INCARNATION
AT
ALL
NESTORIUS
SEEMED
TO
THINK
IN
BLACK
AND
WHITE
TERMS
AND
MISSED
THE
SORTS
OF
NUANCES
ONE
NEEDS
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
AREA
YOU
SAY
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
PREINCARNATION
THAT
JESUSS
HUMAN
NATURE
WAS
IN
HEAVEN
I
DONT
THINK
THATS
REQUIRED
BY
ORTHODOX
DOCTRINE
ITS
THE
DIVINE
LOGOS
THAT
IS
ETERNAL
