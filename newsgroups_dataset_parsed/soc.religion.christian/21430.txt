RE
MORMON
BELIEFS
ABOUT
BASTARDS
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
COULD
ANYONE
ENLIGHTEN
ME
ON
HOW
THE
MORMON
CHURCH
VIEWS
CHILDREN
BORN
OUT
OF
WEDLOCK
IN
PARTICULAR
IM
INTERESTED
TO
KNOW
IF
ANY
STIGMA
IS
ATTACHED
TO
THE
CHILDREN
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
PARENTS
IM
ESPECIALLY
KEEN
TO
LEARN
IF
THERE
IS
OR
IS
NOT
ANY
PROHIBITION
IN
THE
MORMON
FAITH
ON
BASTARDS
ENTERING
HEAVEN
OR
HAVING
THEIR
NAMES
ENTERED
IN
THE
BIG
GENEALOGICAL
BOOK
THE
MORMONS
KEEP
IN
SALT
LAKE
CITY
IF
THIS
IS
AN
ISSUE
ON
WHICH
THE
OFFICIAL
POSITION
HAS
CHANGED
OVER
TIME
IM
INTERESTED
IN
LEARNING
BOTH
OLD
AND
NEW
BELIEFS
EMAIL
OR
POSTING
IS
FINE
ALL
INFORMATION
OR
POINTERS
ARE
APPRECIATED
WELL
SINCE
MY
WIFE
IS
IN
YOUR
GENTLE
TERM
A
BASTARD
I
CAN
PROBABLY
SPEAK
WITH
A
BIT
OF
AUTHORITY
ON
THIS
ANY
STIGMA
ASSOCIATED
WITH
CHILDREN
CONCEIVED
ANDOR
BORN
OUT
OF
WEDLOCK
RESTS
SOLELY
UPON
THE
PARENTSTHEYVE
COMMITTED
A
SEXUAL
TRANSGRESSION
FOR
WHICH
THEY
SHOULD
REPENT
THE
CHILD
ITSELF
HAS
NO
A
PRIORI
LIMITATIONS
ON
HIM
OR
HER
INDEED
THE
CONCEPT
OF
BLAMING
THE
CHILD
FOR
THE
PARENTS
SINS
IS
ONE
MOST
MORMONS
WOULD
FIND
APPALLING
NOTE
THAT
LDS
THEOLOGY
REJECTS
ORIGINAL
SIN
AS
THE
TERM
IS
USUALLY
DEFINED
AND
THE
SUBSEQUENT
NEED
FOR
INFANT
BAPTISM
CF
MORONI
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
MORMON
INDEED
LDS
DOCTRINE
GOES
ONE
STEP
FURTHER
AND
IN
SOME
CASES
HOLDS
PARENTS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
CHILDRENS
SINS
IF
THEY
HAVE
FAILED
TO
BRING
THEM
UP
PROPERLY
CF
DC
NOTE
THAT
THIS
PASSAGE
APPLIES
IT
ONLY
TO
MEMBERS
OF
THE
LDS
CHURCH
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
BIG
GENEALOGICAL
BOOK
IN
SALT
LAKE
CITY
THE
LDS
CHURCH
HAS
A
MASSIVE
STORAGE
FACILITY
IN
THE
NEARBY
MOUNTAINS
CONTAINING
ON
MICROFILM
VITAL
STATISTIC
RECORDS
BIRTH
CHRISTENING
BAPTISM
MARRIAGE
DEATH
GATHERED
FROM
ALL
OVER
THE
ENTIRE
WORLD
I
MAY
BE
MISREMEMBERING
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THEY
HAVE
RECORDS
FOR
SOME
BILLION
PEOPLE
IN
THAT
VAULT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
LDS
CHURCH
IS
BUILDING
UP
AN
ONLINE
GENEALOGICAL
DATABASE
IN
NEITHER
CASE
IS
THERE
SOME
KIND
OF
WORTHINESS
SCREENING
AS
TO
WHETHER
SOMEONE
CAN
BE
ENTERED
IN
THE
ONLY
POTENTIAL
ISSUE
IS
THAT
OF
ESTABLISHING
WHO
THE
PARENTS
WERE
AND
THAT
WOULD
APPLY
ONLY
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
DATABASE
