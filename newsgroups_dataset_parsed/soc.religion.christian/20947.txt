re
phone
number
of
wycliffe
translators
uk
im
concerned
about
a
recent
posting
about
wbtsil
i
thought
theyd
pretty
much
been
denounced
as
a
rightwing
organization
involved
in
ideological
manipulation
and
cultural
interference
including
vietnam
and
south
america
a
commission
from
mexican
academia
denounced
them
in
as
a
covert
political
and
ideological
institution
used
by
the
us
govt
as
an
instrument
of
control
regulation
penetration
espionage
and
repression
my
concern
is
that
this
group
may
be
seen
as
acceptable
and
even
praiseworthy
by
readers
of
socreligionchristian
its
important
that
christians
dont
immediately
accept
every
christian
organization
as
automatically
above
reproach
mp
good
heavens
you
mean
my
good
friend
wes
collins
who
took
his
wife
and
two
small
children
into
the
jungles
of
guatemala
despite
dangers
from
primitive
conditions
and
armed
guerillas
so
that
the
indigenous
people
groups
their
could
have
the
bible
in
their
native
languagesthe
young
man
who
led
bible
studies
in
our
church
who
daily
demonstrated
and
declared
his
deep
abiding
faith
in
the
lord
of
loveyou
mean
he
really
was
a
sneaky
imperialistic
spy
whose
real
reason
for
going
was
to
exploit
and
oppress
the
ignorant
and
unsuspecting
masses
imagine
my
surprise
i
never
would
have
thought
it
of
him
how
was
this
terrible
deceit
discovered
what
exactly
was
the
cultural
interference
they
were
caught
committing
attempting
to
persuade
the
locals
that
their
ancestral
gods
were
false
gods
and
their
sacrifices
including
human
sacrifices
in
some
cases
were
vain
destroying
traditional
lifestyles
by
introducing
steel
tools
medical
vaccines
and
durable
clothes
oh
and
by
the
way
who
did
the
denouncing
i
am
terribly
shocked
to
hear
that
my
friend
wes
who
seemed
so
nice
was
really
such
a
deceitful
tool
of
the
devil
please
provide
me
with
specific
documentation
on
this
charge
there
is
some
risk
that
i
may
not
believe
it
otherwise
