CARDINAL

WRITES
I
HAVE
SEEN
TWO
COMMON
THREADS
RUNNING
THROUGH
POSTINGS
BY
ATHEISTS
ON
THE
NEWSGROUP
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
CAN
BE
USED
TO
EXPLAIN
EACH
OTHER
UNFORTUNATELY
I
DONT
HAVE
DIRECT
QUOTES
HANDY
ATHEISTS
BELIEVE
THAT
WHEN
THEY
DIE
THEY
DIE
FOREVER
A
GOD
WHO
WOULD
CONDEMN
THOSE
WHO
FAIL
TO
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
TO
ETERNAL
DEATH
IS
UNFAIR
I
DONT
SEE
WHAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TO
CHRISTIANS
HELL
IS
BY
DEFINITION
ETERNAL
DEATHEXACTLY
WHAT
ATHEISTS
ARE
EXPECTING
WHEN
THEY
DIE
THIS
IS
THE
PROBLEM
THIS
IS
NOT
HELL
THIS
IS
PERMANENT
DEATH
IT
IS
INDEED
WHAT
ATHEISTS
GENERALLY
EXPECT
AND
IT
IS
NEITHER
FAIR
NOR
UNFAIR
IT
JUST
IS
YOU
MIGHT
AS
WELL
ARGUE
ABOUT
WHETHER
BEING
MADE
MOSTLY
OF
CARBON
AND
WATER
IS
FAIR
HOWEVER
THE
ATHEISTS
WHO
CLAIM
THAT
HELL
IS
UNFAIR
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
FIRE
AND
BRIMSTONE
PLACE
OF
ENDLESS
SUFFERING
WHICH
NECESSARILY
INCLUDES
ETERNAL
EXISTANCE
LIFE
I
DUNNO
BUT
SOME
SORT
OF
CONTINUATION
NOT
AT
ALL
THE
SAME
THING
GRANTED
YOU
CLEARLY
FEEL
THAT
HELLDEATH
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
A
UNIVERAL
SENTIMENT
AS
NEAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
IF
YOUR
IDEA
OF
GOD
CONDEMNS
HEATHENS
TO
ORDINARY
DEATH
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THAT
I
DO
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
GODS
THAT
HIDE
FROM
HUMANS
AND
TORTURE
THE
UNBELIEVERS
ETERNALLY
FOR
NOT
GUESSING
RIGHT
DELETIA
HELL
AND
LITERALNESS
DAN
JOHNSON
AND
GOD
SAID
JEEZE
THIS
IS
DULL
AND
IT
WAS
DULL
GENESIS
THESE
OPINIONS
PROBABLY
SHOW
WHAT
I
KNOW
