BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTIONS
IN
THIS
THREAD
CONCERNING
CHRISTIANS
OF
JEWISH
DESCENT
AND
THE
LAW
I
ALWAYS
WONDER
WHEN
I
SEE
POSTS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
WHETHER
THE
WRITERS
ARE
CHRISTIANS
OF
JEWISH
DESCENT
RELATING
THE
LIFEDECISIONS
GOD
HAS
LED
THEM
TO
OR
PEOPLE
WHO
TAKE
ONLY

ACADEMIC
INTEREST
IN
THE
TOPIC
HAVING
KNOWN
SEANNA
SINCE
SHE
WAS
NINE

I
DO
KNOW
IN
THIS
CASE
I
ADMIT
THAT
THE
ANSWER
TO
THIS

AFFECTS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
WEIGHT
I
GIVE
