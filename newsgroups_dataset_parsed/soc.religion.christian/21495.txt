SATANIC
TOUNGES

ALLEN
KOBERG
WRITES
THERE
SEEM
TO
BE
MANY
POINTS
TO
THE
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
THING
WHICH
ARE
PROBLEMATIC
ITS
USE
AS
PRAYER
LANGUAGE
SEEMS
ESPECIALLY
TROUBLING
TO
ME
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
WHEN
YOU
PRAY
IN
TONGUES
THE
SPIRIT
IS
DOING
THE
TALKING
AND
WHEN
YOU
PRAY
YOU
PRAY
TO
GOD
AND
THE
SPIRIT
IS
GOD
SO
THE
SPIRIT
IS
TALKING
TO
HIMSELF
WHICH
IS
WHY
I
ONLY
GO
BY
THE
PENTECOST
USE
WHERE
ITS
AN
ACTUAL
LANGUAGE
WHAT
IS
WRONG
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
TALKING
TO
HIMSELF
JESUS
INTERCEDES
FOR
US
AND
ROMANS
TELL
OF
HOW
THE
SPIRIT
INTERCEDES
FOR
US
BEFORE
GOD
THAT
IS
NO
THEOLOGICAL
PROBLEM
TOUNGES
AS
A
PRAYER
LANGUAGE
FINDS
SUPPORT
IN
I
CORINTHIANS
MOREOVER
THE
PHRASE
THOUGH
I
SPEAK
WITH
THE
TONGUES
OF
MEN
AND
ANGELS
USED
BY
PAUL
IN
I
COR
IS
MISLEADING
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
SOME
WOULD
THEN
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
ANGELIC
TONGUE
AND
IF
WHEN
THEY
SPEAK
IT
IS
NO
KNOWN
LANGUAGE
THEN
IT
IS
AN
ANGELIC
TONGUE
ITS
TRUE
THAT
THIS
COULD
BE
AND
HAS
BEEN
USED
AS
A
RUG
TO
SWEEP
ANY
DIFFICULTIES
UNDER
BUT
IT
IS
A
VALID
POINT
PAUL
DOES
MENTION
ANGELIC
TOUNGES
IN
THE
VERSE
HMMMIN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
STORY
ABOUT
THE
TOWER
OF
BABEL
WE
SEE
HOW
GOD
PUNISHED
BY
GIVING
US
DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE
CAN
WE
ASSUME
THEN
THAT
IF
ANGELS
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
LANGUAGE
AT
ALL
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THE
SAME
ONE
AMONGST
OTHER
ANGELS
AFTER
ALL
THEY
WERE
NOT
PUNISHED
IN
ANY
MANNER
IF
THE
LANGUAGES
WE
SEPAK
ARE
THE
RESULT
OF
BABEL
THEN
IT
STANDS
TO
REASON
THAT
ANGELS
WOULD
SPEAK
A
DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE
FROM
US
YOU
DO
HAVE
A
VALID
POINT
ABOUT
MULTIPLE
ANGELIC
LANGUAGES
BUT
ANGELIC
BEINGS
MAYBE
OF
DIFFERENT
SPECIES
SO
TO
SPEAK
MAYBE
DIFFERENT
SPECIES
COMMUNICATE
DIFFERENTLY
TROUBLE
IS
WHILE
SUCH
STORIES
ABOUND
ANY
AND
ALL
ATTEMPTS
AT
VERIFICATION
AND
WE
ARE
TO
TEST
THE
SPIRIT
EITHER
SHOW
THAT
THE
WITNESS
HAD
NO
REAL
IDEA
OF
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OR
THAT
OUTRIGHT
FABRICATION
WAS
INVOLVED
THE
BROTHER
PUKA
STORY
IN
A
PREVIOUS
POST
SEEMS
LIKE
A
FRIEND
OF
A
FRIEND
THING
AND
LINGUISTICALLY
A
TWO
SYLLABLE
WORD
HARDLY
QUALIFIES
AS
LANGUAGE
INFLECTION
OR
NO
I
HAVE
HEARD
AN
EYEWITNESS
ACCOUNT
MYSELF
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
HARD
TO
PROVE
THEY
DONT
LEND
THEMSELVES
TO
A
LABORATORY
THING
VERY
WELL
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
IS
A
VERY
HOLY
THING
TO
TAKE
GIFTS
INTO
A
LABORATORY
ANYWAY
MUCH
AS
MANY
FAITH
HEALERS
HAVE
TROUBLE
PROVING
THEIR
VICTORIES
SINCE
MOST
AILMENTS
CURED
ARE
JUST
PLAIN
UNPROVABLE
AND
MODERN
DAY
RESSURRECTIONS
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
VALIDATED
SO
IS
IT
TRUE
THAT
NO
MODERN
DAY
XENOGLOSSOLALIA
HAS
BEEN
PROVED
BY
CLERGY
OR
LAY
THATS
AN
UNPROVABLE
STATEMENT
HOW
CAN
YOU
PROVE
IF
SOMETHINGS
BEEN
PROVED
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
KNOW
THAT
YOUVE
SEEN
ALL
THE
EVIDENCE
ONCE
I
SAW
AN
ORTHODONTISTS
RECORDS
COMPLETE
WITH
PHOTOGRAPHS
SHOWING
HOW
ONE
OF
HIS
PATIENTS
SEVERE
UNDERBITE
WAS
CURED
BY
CONSTANT
PRAYER
JOHN
G
LAKES
ONCE
PRAYED
FOR
SOMEONE
AND
SAW
THEM
HEALED
IN
A
LABORATORY
ACCORDING
TO
ADVENTURES
IN
GOD
ITS

INTERESTING
