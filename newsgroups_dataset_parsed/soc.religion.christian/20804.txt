DID

REALLY
RISE
IN

WRITES
THE
BASIC
PROBLEM
WITH
YOUR
ARGUMENT
IS
YOUR
TOTAL
AND
COMPLETE
RELIANCE
ON
THE
BIBLICAL
TEXT
LUKES
ACCOUNT
IS
HIGHLY
SUSPECT
I
WOULD
REFER
YOU
TO
THE
HERMENEIA
COMMENTARY
ON
ACTS
IN
ARTICLE
ATAHFSIHFSICOM
JOHN
ATA
WRITES
EVEN
IF
THERE
WAS
NO
INDEPENDENT
PROOF
THAT
LUKES
ACCOUNT
WAS
VALID
I
FIND
IT
STRANGE
THAT
YOU
WOULD
TAKE
THE
NEGATION
OF
IT
AS
TRUTH
WITHOUT
ANY
DIRECT
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
AT
LEAST
THAT
YOUVE
MENTIONED
TO
BACK
IT
UP
THE
ASSERTION
WAS
MADE
UNEQUIVOCALLY
THAT
NO
CHRISTIAN
EVER
SUFFERRED
FOR
THEIR
FAITH
BY
BELIEVING
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
LUKES
ACCOUNT
SUGGESTS
OTHERWISE
AND
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
DIRECT
EYEWITNESSES
WHO
CAN
CLAIM
THAT
LUKE
IS
MISTAKEN
THEN
I
SUGGEST
THAT
THIS
UNEQUIVOCAL
ASSERTION
IS
SUSPECT
JOHN
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TAKEN
ONE
PEICE
OF
MY
RESPONSE
WITHOUT
BOTHERING
TO
CONNECT
IT
WITH
THE
OTHER
PARTS
I
HAVE
REPEATEDLY
NOTED
THAT
ONE
NEEDS
TO
TAKE
THE
PROBLEMATIC
HISTORCITY
OF
ACTS
AND
THEN
EXAMINE
THE
WORK
OF
JOHN
DOMINIC
CROSSAN
AND
BURTON
MACK
ONCE
YOU
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
TIME
TO
EXAMINE
RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS
IN
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARSHIP
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
GRASP
MORE
CLEARLY
WHAT
I
AM
SAYING
I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
CLAIM
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
SOMEWHAT
MORE
LIMITED
THAN
THIS
IT
WAS
AN
ANSWER
TO
THE
CLAIM
THAT
THE
WITNESSES
COULDNT
BE
LYING
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
WILLIGN
TO
SUFFER
FOR
THEIR
BELIEFS
THUS
ITS
NOT
NECESSARY
TO
SHOW
THAT
NO
CHRISTIAN
EVER
SUFFERED
FOR
BELIEVING
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
RATHER
THE
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
THOSE
WHO
WITNESSED
IT
DID
I
DO
AGREE
THAT
THE
POSTING
YOURE
RESPONDING
TO
SHOWS
THAT
THERE
CAN
BE
LIBERAL
AS
WELL
AS
CONSERVATIVE
DOGMATISM
CLH
CERTAINLY
THIS
IS
AN
ISSUE
AS
I
THINK
THE
SITUATION
IN
WACO
SHOWS
MOST
CLEARLY
IF
ALL
THAT
IS
REQUIRED
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
WILLING
TO
DIE
FOR
A
BELIEF
FOR
IT
TO
BE
TRUE
THEN
SURELY
DAVID
KORESH
IS
THE
SON
OF
GOD
NO
THE
SPURRIOUS
ARGUEMENT
THAT
THE
RESURRECTION
HAD
TO
BE
TRUE
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
BE
WILLING
TO
DIE
MUST
BE
PUT
TO
REST
THE
OTHER
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
IT
IS
SO
MONOLOGOCENTRIC
EVEN
IF
THE
RESURRECTION
WAS
A
BIG
DEAL
WHICH
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
FOR
EITHER
Q
THOMAS
OR
EVEN
JOHN
TO
A
CERTAIN
DEGREE
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
OTHER
THINGS
WHICH
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
TOGETHER
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
WORTH
DYING
FOR
IT
IS
MY
BELIEF
THAT
EVEN
THE
IDEA
OF
A
MIXED
RACE
COMMUNITY
WHICH
BROUGHT
DOWN
REGIONALNATIONAL
BOUNDARIES
IN
THE
NAME
OF
KOINONIA
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
ENOUGH
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
BE
WILLING
TO
DIE
RADICAL
COMMUNTIES
DO
THAT
EG
JONESTOWN
WACO
WARSAW
ETC
BUT
MY
ORIGINAL
POINT
WAS
THAT
ROMAN
PERSECUTION
WHICH
IS
THE
ONLY
PERSECUTION
WE
HAVE
DOCUMENTED
PROOF
OF
WAS
NOT
ABOUT
WHETHER
A
CARPENTER
CAME
BACK
FROM
THE
DEAD
SUCH
A
CLAIM
WAS
NOT
UNIQUE
NOR
PARTICULARLY
ABHORENT
TO
THE
ROMAN
OR
GREEK
MIND
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
AVOIDANCE
OF
MILITARY
AND
CIVIC
DUTY
IE
EMPEROR
WORSHIP
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
MORE
PROBLEMATIC
WHICH
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
RESURRECTION
AT
ALL
WHEN
NERO
USED
CHRISTIANS
AS
HUMAN
TORCHES
TO
LIGHT
UP
HIS
DINNER
PARTY
IT
WASNT
BECAUSE
THE
BELIEVE
IN
A
RISEN
SAVIOR
IT
WAS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
SUPPOSEDLY
INVOLVED
IN
INCEST
AND
CANNABLISM
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WERE
MARTYRED
FOR
THE
RESURRECTION
JUST
CANNOT
STAND
UP
TO
CRITICAL
EXAMINATION
