re
doing
the
work
of
god
hedrickcsrutgersedu
writes
down
these
distinctions
in
him
there
is
neither
jew
nor
greek
there
is
neither
slave
nor
free
there
is
neither
male
nor
female
if
moslems
do
not
know
him
we
may
preach
to
them
but
we
dont
kill
as
a
muslim
spelled
sometimes
as
moslem
i
must
say
that
muslims
strong
ly
believe
in
jesus
refered
in
islamic
text
as
eesauas
jesus
j
esu
s
esu
pronounced
eeesaw
yah
we
knew
him
well
ideally
this
war
should
not
even
be
and
even
in
a
time
of
war
our
goal
is
peace
we
should
try
to
refrain
from
viloating
the
peace
of
others
as
then
if
we
do
violate
we
will
not
have
peace
in
ourselves
i
dont
like
this
war
eaither
it
is
a
conflict
of
territory
croats
muslims
and
serbs
lived
together
before
in
peace
the
rallying
point
is
race
and
im
sure
that
there
is
a
general
out
there
who
wouldnt
mind
being
a
president
mohammad
r
khan
after
july
please
send
mail
to
mkhannyxcsduedu
from
a
christian
perspective
moslem
ideas
about
jesus
look
rather
seriously
erroneous
ive
generally
tried
to
avoid
discussions
of
islam
in
this
group
since
socreligionislam
is
the
right
place
for
that
thus
i
dont
much
want
to
go
into
detail
i
will
simply
note
that
moslems
reject
most
of
what
christians
regard
as
the
most
essential
facts
about
jesus
so
at
least
from
a
christian
perspective
moslems
dont
know
jesus
again
this
is
no
justification
for
christians
to
hate
moslems
or
to
kill
them
i
agree
with
you
that
this
war
should
never
be
clh
