RE
HOMOSEXUALITY
ISSUES

CHRISTIANITY

L
OVERACKER
SAID
IN
ARTICLE
HARDCORE
ALASKAN
WRITES
I
HOPE
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
REMEMBERS
SEEING
REV
TROY
PERRYS
PERFORMANCE
AT
THE
MARCH
ON
WASHINGTON
WILL
SEE
FOR
THEMSELVES
JUST
HOW
INCONCEIVABLE
IT
IS
TO
MIX
CHRISTIANITY
WITH
HOMOSEXUALITY
WHETHER
OR
NOT
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
ARE
COMPATIBLE
IS
CLEARLY
DEBATABLE
SINCE
IT
IS
BEING
DEBATED
IN
MY
OPNION
IT
IS
GENUINELY
DESTUCTIVE
TO
THE
CAUSE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
TO
USE
THIS
SORT
OF
AD
HOMINEM
ARGUMENT
TO
OPPOSE
ONES
ADVERSARIES
IT
ONLY
SERVES
TO
FURTHER
DRIVE
PEOPLE
AWAY
FROM
CHRISTIANITY
BECAUSE
IT
PROJECTS
AND
CONFIRMS
THE
FREQUENTLY
HELD
OPINION
THAT
CHRISTIANS
ARE
UNABLE
TO
THINK
CRITICALLY
AND
INTELLIGENTLY
I
AGREE
ENTIRELY
SPEAKING
AS
AN
ATHEIST
HETEROSEXUAL
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
LEAST
ATTRACTIVE
PARTS
OF
SOME
VARIETIES
OF
CHRISTIANITY
ALTHOUGH
IM
SURE
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
ARGUE
THEOLOGICALLY
THAT
WE
SHOULDNT
MAKE
ANALOGIES
BETWEEN
DISCRIMINATION
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SEX
AND
RACE
AND
DISCRIMINATION
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SEXUAL
ORIENTATION
MORALLY
THE
CASE
LOOKS
UNANSWERABLE
FOR
THOSE
OUTSIDE
RELIGION
THE
THREE
FORMS
ARE
ANALOGOUS
WE
SHOULDNT
DISCRIMINATE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SEX
RACE
OR
SEXUAL
ORIENTATION
I
FOUND
THE
MODERATORS
FAQS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
INSTRUCTIVE
AND
RECOMMEND
EVERYONE
TO
READ
THEM
THERE
SEEM
TO
BE
THREE
DIFFERENT
LEVELS
OF
ACCEPTANCE
REGARD
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
AS
A
SIN
OR
EVIL
WHATEVER
REGARD
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOUR
AS
A
SIN
BUT
ACCEPT
ORIENTATION
THOUGH
PRESUMABLY
ORIENTATION
IS
UNFORTUNATE
AND
DISLIKE
PEOPLE
WHO
INDULGE
AS
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNER
ACCEPT
HOMOSEXUALITY
ALTOGETHER
MY
EXPERIENCE
IS
THAT
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
ATTITUDE
I
IMAGINE
AND
ARE
LIMITED
TO
A
FEW
FUNDAMENTALIST
SECTS
I
SUPPOSE
I
CAN
GO
ALONG
WITH
EXCEPT
THAT
I
HAVE
THIS
FEELING
THAT
A
YEAR
OLD
LIVING
IN
A
COMMUNITY
WITH
THIS
ATTITUDE
ON
DISCOVERING
THAT
THEY
WERE
MORE
ATTRACTED
TO
MEMBERS
OF
THE
SAME
SEX
WOULD
NOT
FEEL
THE
LOVE
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
BUT
WOULD
RATHER
FEEL
THE
PRESSURE
NOT
TO
EXHIBIT
THEIR
FEELINGS
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
THE
COMMUNITY
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
PARENTS
WOULD
NOT
LOVE
THE
CHILD
BUT
I
SUSPECT
THE
CHILD
WOULD
NOT
FEEL
LOVED
