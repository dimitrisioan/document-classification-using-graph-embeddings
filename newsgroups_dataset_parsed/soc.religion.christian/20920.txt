WRITES
THIS
MAY
BE
A
REALLY
DUMB
ONE
BUT
ILL
ASK
IT
ANYWAYS
CHRISTIANS
KNOW
THAT
THEY
CAN
NEVER
LIVE
UP
TO
THE
REQUIREMENTS
OF
GOD
RIGHT
I
MAY
BE
WRONG
BUT
THAT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
BUT
THEY
STILL
TRY
TO
DO
IT
DOESNT
IT
SEEM
LIKE
WE
ARE
SPENDING
ALL
OF
OUR
LIVES
TRYING
TO
REACH
A
GOAL
WE
CAN
NEVER
ACHIEVE
I
KNOW
THAT
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
FAITH
AND
NOT
BY
WORKS
BUT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
ONCE
WE
ARE
SAVED
WE
DONT
HAVE
TO
DO
ANYTHING
I
THINK
JAMES
TELLS
US
THAT
FAITH
WITHOUT
WORKS
IS
DEAD
PARAPHRASE
HOW
DOES
THIS
WORK
SO
LONG
AS
WE
THINK
THAT
GOOD
THINGS
ARE
WHAT
WE
HAVE
TO
DO
RATHER
THAN
WHAT
WE
COME
TO
WANT
TO
DO
WE
MISS
THE
POINT
THE
MORE
WE
LOVE
GOD
THE
MORE
WE
COME
TO
LOVE
WHAT
AND
WHOM
HE
LOVES
WHEN
I
FIND
THAT
WHAT
I
AM
DOING
IS
NOT
GOOD
IT
IS
NOT
A
SIGN
TO
TRY
EVEN
HARDER
ROMANS
IT
IS
A
SIGN
TO
SEEK
GOD
WHEN
I
AM
AWARE
OF
JESUS
PRESENCE
I
USUALLY
WANT
WHAT
HE
WANTS
IT
IS
HIS
STRENTH
HIS
LOVE
