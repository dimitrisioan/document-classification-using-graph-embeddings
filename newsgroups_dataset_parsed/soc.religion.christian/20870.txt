hello
im
back
i
would
first
like
to
thank
each
and
every
person
who
sent
me
a
response
be
it
a
positive
or
negative
one
i
read
every
letter
and
thought
about
each
one
i
got
all
sorts
of
responses
from
marry
her
to
have
nothing
ever
to
do
with
her
again
through
reading
the
bible
and
through
a
lot
of
prayer
here
is
what
i
have
decided
to
do
i
sent
her
a
letter
today
first
i
told
her
that
if
she
was
really
serious
about
moving
away
from
home
to
another
state
that
i
would
do
anything
to
get
you
here
in
nc
i
told
her
that
i
tried
to
find
out
if
there
were
any
new
stores
planning
to
be
builtbut
they
wouldnt
tell
me
about
her
marraige
comment
im
not
gonna
call
it
a
proposal
cause
i
still
dont
know
if
it
was
a
total
joke
or
not
i
more
or
less
said
that
marry
me
well
get
transferred
to
nc
first
and
then
well
talk
hopefully
what
i
said
could
be
interpreted
either
way
needless
to
say
there
has
been
a
lot
of
praying
over
thisi
have
done
a
lot
of
reading
about
marraige
from
the
bible
if
she
was
dead
serious
about
getting
marriedi
wouldnt
do
it
yet
simply
bc
she
is
not
as
far
as
i
know
to
this
point
a
christian
it
just
wouldnt
work
wo
god
in
the
marraige
as
well
i
figure
that
if
god
wanrs
this
to
go
throughhes
kept
us
in
touch
for
years
nowhe
can
handle
one
more
if
god
wants
it
to
happen
it
will
happen
she
will
be
in
nc
in
june
meetinf
some
relatives
so
ill
get
to
see
herand
ill
get
a
letter
from
her
befoe
then
so
i
know
more
of
what
to
look
forward
to
i
guess
all
i
can
do
now
is
wait
and
pray
i
have
decided
not
to
tell
my
folks
until
im
totally
sure
what
is
going
on
i
do
ask
that
everyone
that
wrote
me
to
please
keep
this
situation
in
your
prayers
finally
i
would
like
to
thank
everyone
who
wrote
in
if
you
have
anything
else

mei

this
email
address
