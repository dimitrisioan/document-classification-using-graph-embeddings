OK
WHATS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
GAY
CHRISTIANS
SEX
OR
CHRISTIANITY
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
HOPE
WOULD
THEY
BE
WILLING
TO
FORGO
SEX
COMPLETELY
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
BEING
A
STUMBLING
BLOCK
TO
OTHERS
TO
AVOID
THE
CHANCE
THAT
THEIR
INTERPRETATION
MIGHT
BE
WRONG
ETC
IF
NOT
WHY
NOT
HETEROSEXUALS
ABSTAIN
ALL
THE
TIME
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
PROTESTANT
CHURCHES
HAD
CELIBATE
ORDERS
TO
SHOW
THE
WORLD
THAT
SEX
IS
NOT
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
IN
LIFE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
STRAIGHT
MEMBERS
ARE
GIVEN
THE
CHOICE
OF
ABSTAINING
OR
NOT
AND
CELIBACY
IS
RECOGNIZED
AS
A
GIFT
GIVEN
ONLY
TO
SOME
GAYS
ARE
TOLD
THAT
AS
A
CONDITION
OF
ACCEPTANCE
THEY
MUST
BE
CELIBATE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
GIVES
ME
A
FORCED
CHOICE
BETWEEN
HAVING
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
AND
EXPRESSING
MY
HETEROSEXUALITY
WITHIN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
A
FAITHFUL
RELATIONSHIP
NOR
DO
I
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
GIVES
THAT
FORCED
CHOICE
TO
GAYS
SEX
OR
CHRISTIANITY
IS
A
FALSE
DICHOTOMY
TO
TELL
THE
TRUTH
GAY
CHURCHES
REMIND
ME
A
LOT
OF
HENRY
THE
VIII
STARTING
THE
CHURCH
OF
ENGLAND
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
A
DIVORCE
OR
IS
THIS
A
MYTH
NOTE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
DENYING
THAT
GAY
CHRISTIANS
ARE
CHRISTIAN
FOR
MY
PART
GAY
CHURCHES
REMIND
ME
OF
BLACKS
STARTING
THEIR
OWN
CHURCHES
EITHER
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
NOT
ALLOWED
AT
ALL
IN
THE
WHITE
CHURCHES
OR
AT
BEST
ONLY
WITH
SPECIAL
RESTRICTIONS
THAT
DID
NOT
APPLY
TO
WHITE
MEMBERS
