ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
I
SELDOM
SEE
ANY
POSTS
IN
THIS
GROUP
IS
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
IN
CHRISTENDOM
LISTENING
IF
SO
WHY
DONT
WE
GET
SOME
DIALOG
GOING
HERE
HERES
A
TOPIC
TO
GET
THINGS
STARTED
MY
DAUGHTERS
CHRISTIAN
SCHOOL
SENDS
HOME
A
WEEKLY
UPDATE
ON
SCHOOL
RELATED
TOPICS
THIS
WEEK
THEY
SENT
SOMETHING
VERY
INTERESTING
IT
WAS
AN
ARTICLE
WRITTEN
BY
THE
LEADER
OF
A
NATIONAL
US
CHRISTIAN
SCHOOL
ORGANIZATION
ABOUT
A
TRIP
HE
RECENTLY
MADE
TO
JERUSALEM
WHILE
THERE
HE
WAS
INTRODUCED
TO
ONE
OF
THE
RABBIS
WHO
IS
WORKING
ON
A
PROJECT
TO
REBUILD
THE
TEMPLE
AT
JERUSALEM
THE
ARTICLE
INCLUDED
PHOTOS
OF
THE
MANY
FURNISHINGS
THAT
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
MADE
IN
PREPARATION
FOR
FURNISHING
THE
REBUILT
TEMPLE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SPECIFICATIONS
GIVEN
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHAT
WAS
EVEN
MORE
STRIKING
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PLANS
FOR
THE
TEMPLE
ARE
COMPLETE
AND
THE
GROUP
IS
ONLY
AWAITING
PERMISSION
FROM
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
BEFORE
BEGINNING
THE
BUILDING
THE
OTHER
STARTLING
FACT
IS
THE
VERY
RECENT
ARCHEOLOGICAL
DISCOVERY
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
SITE
OF
THE
TEMPLE
IS
UNOCCUPIED
AND
AVAILABLE
FOR
BUILDING
PREVIOUSLY
IT
HAS
BEEN
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
SITE
WAS
UNDERNEATH
WHAT
IS
NOW
A
MOSQUE
MAKING
REBUILDING
IMPOSSIBLE
WITHOUT
SPARKING
A
HOLY
WAR
NOW
IT
APPEARS
THAT
NOTHING
STANDS
IN
THE
WAY
OF
REBUILDING
AND
RESUMING
SACRIFICES
AS
THE
SCRIPTURES
INDICATE
WILL
HAPPEN
IN
THE
LAST
DAYS
ALTHOUGH
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
WILL
GIVE
THE
PERMISSION
TO
START
I
THINK
IT
IS
THE
HAND
OF
GOD
HOLDING
THE
PROJECT
UNTIL
HE
IS
READY
TO
LET
IT
HAPPEN
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
THE
TIME
IS
AT
HAND
OUR
REDEMPTION
IS
DRAWING
NEAR
LOOK
UP
POSTINGS

IN
THE
RANGE

SEEING
THAT
