ANNI
DOZIER
WRITES
AFTER
READING
THE
POSTS
ON
THIS
NEWSGROUP
FOR
THE
PASTS
MONTHS
IT
HAS
BECOME
APPARENT
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
GROUP
IS
PRIMARILY
ACTIVE
WITH
LIBERALS
CATHOLICS
NEW
AGERS
AND
ATHIESTS
SOMEONE
MIGHT
THINK
TO
CHANGE
THE
NAME
TO
SOCRELIGIONANY
OR
PERHAPS
EVEN
SOCRELIGIONNEW
IT
MIGHT
SEEM
TO
BE
MORE
APPROPRIATE
HECK
DONT
FLAME
ME
IM
CATHOLIC
GAY
AND
I
VOTED
FOR
BILL
CLINTON
IM
ON
YOUR
SIDE
MY
SENTIMENTS
EXACTLY
WHICH
IS
WHY
IM
UNSUBBING
FROM
THIS
GROUP
THIS
IS
THE
CHRISTIAN
DISCUSSION
LIST
I
HAVE
EVER
BELONGED
TO
AND
ONCE
AGAIN
IM
BEING
CHASED
AWAY
BY
THE
STRIFE
ANGER
DISCONTENT
LIES
ET
AL
AS
PAUL
SAUL
SAID
I
COME
TO
PREACH
CHRIST
AND
HIM
CRUCIFIED
DONT
LET
THE
SIMPLE
BEAUTY
OF
FAITH
IN
GOD
GET
OVERSHADOWED
BY
HEADY
THEOLOGICAL
DISCUSSIONS
OR
THOUSANDS
OF
LINES
OF
POSTINCARNATION
TRAPPINGS
OF
SOME
CHURCH
AS
FOR
THE
ATHEISTSAGNOSTICS
WHO
READ
THIS
LIST
IF
YOU
ARENT
CHRISTIAN
AND
IF
YOU
HAVE
NO
INTENTION
OF
EVER
BECOMING
ONE
WHY
ON
EARTH
DO
YOU
WASTE
YOUR
TIME
AND
MINE
BY
PARTICIPATING
ON
A
CHRISTIAN
DISCUSSION
LIST
I
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
SEARCH
FOR
CHRISTIAN
DISCUSSION
PRAYERFUL
SPIRITFILLED
KIND
HUMBLE
PATIENT
ETC
IN
OTHER
CIRCLES
SHEILA
PATTERSON
CIT
CRTECHNICAL
SUPPORT
GROUP
CCC
CORNELL
UNIVERSITY
ITHACA
NY
IM
AFRAID
THAT
ANY
DISCUSSION
GROUP
CONTAINING
PEOPLE
WITH
DIFFERENT
VIEWS
TENDS
TO
TURN
INTO
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
THE
LARGEST
DIFFERENCES
PRESENT
SO
TALKRELIGIONMISC
SPENDS
A
LOT
OF
TIME
ON
CHRISTIANATHEIST
ARGUMENTS
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
SPENDS
A
LOT
OF
TIME
ON
ARGUMENTS
AMONG
DIFFERENT
CHRISTIAN
GROUPS
AND
THE
BITNET
CATHOLIC
GROUP
SPENDS
A
LOT
OF
TIME
ON
ARGUMENTS
BETWEEN
CONSERVATIVE
AND
LIBERAL
CATHOLICS
PERSONALLY
I
WOULD
PREFER
TO
HAVE
A
SET
OF
SOMEWHAT
MORE
SPECIALIZED
GROUPS
AT
LEAST
AS
AN
ALTERNATIVE
LIBERAL
AND
CONSERVATIVE
PROTESTANT
AND
CATHOLIC
WOULD
HANDLE
MOST
OF
THE
TRAFFIC
THOUGH
THERE
ARE
CERTAINLY
SIGNIFICANT
GROUPS
EG
ORTHODOX
OF
COURSE
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
MOST
OF
OUR
READERS
LIKE
THE
ARGUMENTS
I
CERTAINLY
FIND
IT
PAINFUL
MODERATING
THEM
