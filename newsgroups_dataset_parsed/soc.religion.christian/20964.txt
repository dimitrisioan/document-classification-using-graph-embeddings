RE
LOSING
YOUR
TEMPER
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
TRAIT

RUTH
DITUCCI
WRITES
ONE
OF
THE
TELL
TALE
SIGNSFRUITS
THAT
GIVE
NONCHRISTIANS
AWAY
IS
WHEN
THEIR
NET
REPLIES
ARE
ACRID
ANGRY
AND
SARCASTIC
WE
IN
THE
NET
VILLAGE
DO
HAVE
A
LAUGH
OR
TWO
WHEN
PROFESSED
BORN
AGAIN
CHRISTIANS
VERBALLY
ATTACK
PEOPLE
WHO
MIGHT
OTHERWISE
HAVE
BEEN
WON
TO
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HAD
ORIGINALLY
JOINED
THE
DISCUSSIONS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
SPIRITUALLY
HUNGRY
INSTEAD
OF
ANSWERING
QUESTIONS
WITH
SWEETNESS
AND
SINCERITY
THESE
CHRISITAN
NETWARRIORS
FLAME
THE
QUERIES
ALTHOUGH
I
CERTAINLY
AGREE
WITH
THE
BASIC
SENTIMENT
THAT
SNIDENESS
IS
UNLOVING
AND
INEFFECTIVE
IM
A
LITTLE
DISTURBED
BY
THE
FORMULATION
THAT
ILL
TEMPER
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
TRAIT
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
A
FALSE
ARGUMENT
TO
SAY
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
DISPLAYS
TRAIT
X
MUST
NOT
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
COULD
WELL
BE
A
SINNING
CHRISTIAN
BUT
A
CHRISTIAN
NONETHELESS
ANGER
IS
HUMAN
AND
CHRISTIANS
ARE
HUMAN
CHRISTIANS
GET
ANGRY
AND
DEFENSIVE
AND
REACT
BADLY
JUST
LIKE
EVERYONE
ELSE
ITS
NOT
PERFECT
RIGHTEOUSNESS
BUT
THE
EFFORT
OF
SEEKING
RIGHTEOUSNESS
THAT
MARKS
A
DEDICATED
CHRISTIAN
AND
ONE
OF
THE
GREATEST
GIFTS
OF
FAITH
TO
ME
IS
THAT
OF
SEEKING
AND
ACCEPTING
FORGIVENESS
FOR
MY
FAILURES
EXPECTING
FLAWLESS
BEHAVIOR
FROM
SELF
OR
OTHERS
ISNT
CHRISTIANITY
ITS
PERFECTIONISM
