THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
I
DONT
CLAIM
TO
BE
AN
EXPERT
ON
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
BUT
I
MIGHT
KNOW
MORE
THAN
MOST
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIAN
GROUP
LED
BY
KORESH
IS
ACTUALLY
ONE
OF
TWO
OFFSHOOTS
OF
A
GROUP
KNOWN
AS
THE
SHEPHARDS
ROD
THE
SHEPHARDS
ROD
NOW
DEFUNCT
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOWBROKE
OFF
FROM
THE
SDA
CHURCH
IN
THE
THE
SHEPHARDS
ROD
BROKE
AWAY
FROM
THE
SDA
CHURCH
BECAUSE
THEY
FELT
THAT
THE
SDA
CHURCH
WAS
BECOMING
WEAK
AND
FALLING
INTO
APOSTACY
THEY
FELT
THAT
THEY
WERE
THE
REMNANT
SPOKEN
ABOUT
IN
REVELATION
ABOUT
THE
KORESH
GROUP
KORESH
GAINED
CONTROL
OF
IT
IN
OR
ONCE
IN
CONTROL
HE
MADE
HIMSELF
THE
CENTER
OF
IT
HE
PROCLAIMED
HIMSELF
AS
CHRIST
KORESH
HIMSELF
CAME
FROM
AN
SDA
BACKGROUND
HE
WAS
EXCOMMUNICATED
AS
A
YOUNG
ADULT
BY
THE
LOCAL
CONGREGATION
FOR
TRYING
TO
EXERT
TOO
MUCH
CONTROL
OVER
THE
YOUTH
IN
THE
CHURCH
AFTER
THIS
HE
JOINED
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIANS
THEY
WEREARE
A
SURVIVALIST
CULT
THIS
IS
WHY
THEY
HAD
THE
STOCKPILE
OF
WEAPONS
FOOD
A
BOMB
SHELTER
ETC
THEY
HAD
NO
INTENT
OF
RAIDING
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
OR
ANYTHING
THEY
WERE
PREPARING
FOR
ARMAGGEDON
AND
WERE
PUTTING
THEMSELVES
IN
A
SELF
DEFENSE
POSITION
IN
MY
OPINION
IF
THE
ATF
AND
THE
FBI
HAD
LEFT
WELL
ENOUGH
ALONE
WE
WOULDN
T
HAVE
THE
BLOOD
OF
CHILDREN
CRYING
OUT
FROM
THE
ASHES
IN
WACO
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
SHEPHARDS
ROD
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
VISIT
THE
LOCAL
SDA
CHURCH
AND
TALK
TO
SOME
OF
THE
OLDER
PEOPLE
THEY
COULD
GIVE
YOU
SOME
INSIGHT
INTO
WHERE
KORESH
GOT
HIS
THEOLOGY
