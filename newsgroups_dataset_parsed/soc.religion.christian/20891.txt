RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ARTICLE
STEVE
HAYES
WRITES
A
SIMILAR
ANALOGY
MIGHT
BE
A
MEDICAL
DOCTOR
WHO
BELIEVES
THAT
A
BLOOD
TRANSFUSION
IS
NECESSARY
TO
SAVE
THE
LIFE
OF
A
CHILD
WHOSE
PARENTS
ARE
JEHOVAHS
WITNESSES
AND
SO
HAVE
CONSCIENTIOUS
OBJECTIONS
TO
BLOOD
TRANSFUSION
THE
DOCTORS
EFFORTS
TO
PERSUADE
THEM
TO
AGREE
TO
A
BLOOD
TRANSFUSION
COULD
BE
PERCEIVED
TO
BE
ARROGANT
IN
PRECISELY
THE
SAME
WAY
AS
CHRISTIANS
COULD
BE
PERCEIVED
TO
BE
ARROGANT
THE
TRUTH
OR
OTHERWISE
OF
THE
BELIEF
THAT
A
BLOOD
TRANSFUSION
IS
NECESSARY
TO
SAVE
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
CHILD
IS
IRRELEVANT
HERE
WHAT
MATTERS
IS
THAT
THE
DOCTOR
BELIEVES
IT
TO
BE
TRUE
AND
COULD
BE
SEEN
TO
BE
TRYING
TO
FOCE
HIS
BELIEFS
ON
THE
PARENTS
AND
THIS
COULD
WELL
BE
PERCEIVED
AS
ARROGANCE
LET
ME
CARRY
THAT
A
STEP
FURTHER
MOST
DOCTORS
WOULD
NOT
CLAIM
TO
BE
INFALLIBLE
INDEED
THEY
WOULD
GENERALLY
ADMIT
THAT
THEY
COULD
CONCEIVABLY
BE
WRONG
EG
THAT
IN
THIS
CASE
A
BLOOD
TRANFUSION
MIGHT
NOT
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
NECESSARY
AFTER
ALL
HOWEVER
THE
DOCTORS
WOULD
HAVE
ENOUGH
CONFIDENCE
AND
CONVICTION
TO
CLAIM
OUT
OF
GENUINE
CONCERN
THAT
IS
IS
NECESSARY
AS
FALLIBLE
HUMAN
BEINGS
THEY
MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THEY
ARE
WRONG
HOWEVER
THEY
WOULD
ALSO
SAY
THAT
SUCH
DOUBTS
ARE
NOT
REASONABLE
AND
STAND
BY
THEIR
CONVICTIONS
