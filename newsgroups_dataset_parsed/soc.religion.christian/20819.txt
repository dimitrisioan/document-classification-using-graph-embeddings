GROUP
RELIGIOUSLY
FOR
ABOUT
A
MONTH
SOMETIMES
IT
REALLY
GIVES
ME
WHAT
I
NEED
SPIRITUALLY
AT
OTHER
TIMES
I
GET
A
LITTLE
IRATE
THERE
ARE
ALL
KINDS
OF
PEOPLE
IN
EVERY
GROUP
AND
I
TAKE
OFFENSE
AT
INTOLERANCE
ITS
AWFULLY
HARD
TO
TOLERATE
SUCH
PEOPLE
OOPS
IVE
GONE
OVER
MY
SMILEY
QUOTA
ALREADY
AND
ITS
ONLY
THE
SECOND
PARAGRAPH
IMHO
THEY
SHOULD
FOLLOW
THE
COMMANDMENT
TO
LOVE
THY
NEIGHBOR
AND
LEAVE
THE
JUDGING
UP
TO
GOD
SPECIFICALLY
ONES
SEXUAL
ORIENTATION

BE
HAPPY
TO
GET
FLAMED
ENDLESSLY
AND
LOOSE
SCRIPTURE
QUOTATION
CONTESTS
GALORE
TO
DEFEND
THIS
POINT
I
BELEIVE
THIS
IS
CORRECT
BTW
LOVE
THE

HATE
THE

IS
A
SLIPPERY
SLOPE
WITH
HATRED

INCREDIBLY
CHOPPED

I
NEVER
QUITE
UNDERSTOOD
HOW
ANY
GOD
CAN
JUST
GIVE
YOUR
LIFE
MEANING
ACTUALLY
IF
HE
SAYS
YOU
EXISTS
TO
DO
OR
BE
X
THAT
GIVES
YOU
A
PURPOSE
IF
YOU
CARE
TO
ACCEPT
IT
BUT
IS
THAT
THE
SAME
THING
BUT
I
DIGRESS
I
FIND
THAT
I
AM
DISSATISFIED
WITH
THE
LITTLE
PURPOSES
THAT
WE
CAN
MANUFACTURE
FOR
OURSELVES
LITTLE
IN
THE
COSMIC
SENSE
EVEN
THE
GREATEST
OF
THE
GREAT
PHAROS
ARE
LONG
GONE
THE
PYRAMIDS
HISTORICAL
ODDITIES
BEING
WORN
DOWN
BY
THE
WIND
EVENTUALLY
TO
BE
TURNED
INTO
DUST
MANKIND
ITSELF
WILL
ONE
DAY
PERISH
WITHOUT
SOME
INTERCONNECTEDNESS
THAT
TRANSCENDS
THE
PHYSICAL
WITHOUT
GOD
IT
IS
ALL
POINTLESS
IN
THE
END
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
ABLE
TO
LIVE
WITH
THAT
AND
FOR
THEM
LITTLE
PURPOSES
SUCCESS
MONEY
POWER
EFFECTING
CHANGE
HELPING
OTHERS
SUFFICE
I
SUPPOSE
THEY
NEVER
THINK
ABOUT
THE
COSMIC
SCALE
OR
ARE
AT
LEAST
ABLE
TO
PUT
IT
OUT
OF
THEIR
MINDS
TO
ME
IT
IS
COMFORTING
TO
KNOW
THAT
REALITY
IS
AN
ILLUSION
THAT
THE
TRUE
REALITY
UNDERNEATH
THE
THE
PHYSICAL
IS
SPIRIT
THAT
THIS
WORLD
IS
A
SCHOOL
OF
SORTS
WHERE
WE
LEARN
AND
GROW
AND
OUR
SOULS
MATURE
THAT
GIVES
A
PURPOSE
TO
MY
LITTLE
PURPOSES
AND
TAKES
SOME
OF
THE
PRESSURE
OFF
ITS
NOT
SO
NECESSARY
TO
MAKE
THIS
LIFE
A
SUCCESS
IN
HUMAN
TERMS
IF
YOURE
REALLY
JUST
HERE
TO
LEARN
ITS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
PROGRESS
GROW
PERSIST
TO
LEARN
TO
LOVE
YOURSELF
AND
OTHERS
AND
TO
EXPRESS
YOUR
LOVE
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
ITS
DIFICULT
TO
DO
SO
HONEST
EFFORT
IS
REWARDED
BY
GOD
HE
KNOWS
OUR
LIMITATIONS
I
WILL
LIVE
FOREVER
WITH
GOD
AH
NOW
HERE
WE
BEGIN
TO
DIVERGE
I
WILL
NOT
LIVE
FOREVER
WITH
ANYONE
I
DONT
THINK
YOU
WILL
EITHER
BUT
YOU
ARE
WELCOME
TO
YOUR
OPINION
ON
THE
MATTER
INTERESTING
THEOLOGICAL
QUESTION
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THAT
MOST
COMMON
PERCEPTION
OF
ETERNAL
LIFE
IS
WAY
OFF
BASE
IF
I
WERE
TO
BE
IMPRISONED
IN
THE
LIMITED
EGOMIND
I
AM
IN
NOW
I
DOUBT
I
WOULD
CHOOSE
IMORTALITY
IT
WOULD
GET
AWFULLY
BORING
TWO
SERIOUS
QUESTIONSINVITATIONS
TO
DISCUSSION
WHAT
IS
THE
NATURE
OF
ETERNAL

HOW
CAN
WE
AS
