HEARING
SINNERS
ON
THE
QUESTION
DOES
GOD
HEAR
THE
PRAYERS
OF
SINNERS
WE
NEED
TO
DISTINGUISH
IF
WE
SAY
THAT
HE
NEVER
HEARS
THE
PRAYERS
OF
ANY
WHO
HAVE
SINNED
WE
MAKE
POINTLESS
ALL
PRAYERS
BY
ANYONE
BORN
LESS
THAN
CENTURIES
AGO
BUT
IF
WE
CONSIDER
THE
PRAYERS
OF
THE
IMPENITENT
SINNER
OF
SOMEONE
WHO
SAYS
LORD
I
WANT
YOU
TO
DO
THIS
FOR
ME
BUT
DONT
EXPECT
ME
TO
CHANGE
MY
WAY
OF
LIFE
THAT
IS
A
DIFFERENT
MATTER
EVEN
HERE
I
WOULD
NOT
VENTURE
TO
SAY
THAT
GOD
NEVER
GRANTS
SUCH
PETITIONS
JUST
AS
HE
SENDS
SUN
AND
RAIN
ON
THE
EVIL
AND
ON
THE
GOOD
HOWEVER
IF
SOMEONE
WE
KNOW
WELL
IS
PRAYING
TO
GOD
IN
THAT
SPIRIT
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
SAY
REMEMBER
IF
GODS
HELP
IS
REAL
THEN
SO
ARE
HIS
COMMANDS
