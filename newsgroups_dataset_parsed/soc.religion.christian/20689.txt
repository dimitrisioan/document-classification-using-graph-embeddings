I
THINK
CHRISTIANITY
GOES
DOWN
IN
FLAMES
IF
THE
RESURRECTION
IS
EVER
DISPROVED
DIDNT
PAUL
WRITE
THAT
IF
THE
RESURRECTION
IS
NOT
TRUE
WE
ARE
THE
BIGGEST
FOOLS
OF
ALL
HOWEVER
WHETHER
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
CHRIST
OR
NOT
HIS
TEACHINGS
EG
LOVE
YOUR
BROTHERMAN
AS
YOURSELF
EVEN
IF
ONLY
FOLLOWED
AT
A
SECULAR
LEVEL
COULD
DO
A
GREAT
DEAL
TO
ALLEVIATE
SOME
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
WE
SEE
TODAY
IN
THE
WORLD
EVEN
WHEN
I
WAS
A
RABID

WE
ALSO
CANNOT
FAIL
TO
NOTE
THE
INTENSE
SUFFERING
A
DEVASTATION
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
WRECKED
ON
OUR
WORLD
BECAUSE
OF
CHRISTIANS
WHO
WERE
CERTAIN
THEY
WERE
FOLLOWING
CHRIST
FROM
CAPTIALIST
WHO
HAVE
POLLUTED
THE
ENVIORMENT
IN
STRICT
OBEDIENCE
TO
THE
GENSIS
COMMAND
TO
SUBDUE
THE
EARTH
TO
NAZIS
WHO
HAVE
JUSTLY
PUNISHED
THE
JEWS
FOR
THE
KILLING
CHRIST
AS
WELL
AS
THE
OTHER
PROGROMS
THE
INNOCENT
WOMEN
WHO
WERE
BURNED
ALIVE
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
YOU
SHALL
NOT
ALLOW
A
WITCH
TO
LIVE
THE
MOSLEMS
WHO
WERE
KILLED
IN
THE
CRUSADES
THE
GODFEARING
MEN
DESTROYED
BY
THE
INQUISTION
THE
RELIGIOUS
WARS
IN
SPAIN
FRANCE
ENGLAND
ETC
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
UNDOUBTEDLY
CAUSED
THE
MOST
SUFFERING
AND
NEEDLESS
LOSS
OF
LIFE
BY
INDIVIDUALS
WHOSE
CERTAINITY
THAT
THEY
WERE
FOLLOWING
THE
INSTRUCTIONS
THEREIN
WAS
UNQUESTIONABLE
THERE
IS
MUCH
TO
GRIEVE
