I
DONT
NECESSARILY
OBJECT
TO
THE
SECRECY
BUT
I
DO
QUESTION
IT
SINCE
I
SEE
NO
BIBLICAL
REASON
WHY
ANY
ASPECT
OF
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
SHOULD
INVOLVE
SECRECY
EARLY
IN
CHURCH
HISTORY
THE
CATECHUMENS
WERE
DISMISSED
PRIOR
TO
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
EUCHARIST
IT
WAS
SECRET
GIVING
RISE
TO
THE
RUMORS
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WERE
CANNIBALS
AND
ALL
SORTS
OF
PERVERSE
CLAIMS
THE
ACTIONS
WERE
CONSIDERED
TOO
HOLY
TO
BE
OBSERVED
BY
NONCHRISTIANS
AS
WELL
AS
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
FOR
THE
INDIVIDUAL
CHRISTIAN
WHO
MIGHT
BE
IDENTIFIED
