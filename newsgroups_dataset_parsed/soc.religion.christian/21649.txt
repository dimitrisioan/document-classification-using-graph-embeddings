WRITES
HATE
BEGETS
MORE
HATE
NEVER
LOVE
CONSIDER
SOME
SIN
ILL
LEAVE
IT
UNNAMED
SINCE
I
DONT
WANT
THIS
TO
DIGRESS
INTO
AN
ARGUMENT
AS
TO
WHETHER
OR
NOT
SOMETHING
IS
A
SIN
NOW
LETS
APPLY
OUR
HATE
THE
SIN
PHILOSOPHY
AND
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
WE
TRULY
HATE
THE
SIN
THEN
THE
MORE
WE
SEE
IT
THE
STRONGER
OUR
HATRED
OF
IT
WILL
BECOME
EVENTUALLY
THIS
HATE
BECOMES
SO
STRONG
THAT
WE
BECOME
DISGUSTED
WITH
THE
SINNER
AND
EVENTUALLY
COME
TO
HATE
THE
SINNER
THOUGH
YOU
CAN
CERTAILY
ASSERT
ALL
THIS
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
IT
NECESSARILY
HAS
TO
BE
THE
CASE
WHY
CANT
HATE
JUST
STAY
AS
IT
IS
AND
NOT
BEGET
MORE
WHO
SAYS
WE
HAVE
TO
GET
DISGUSTED
AND
START
HATING
THE
SINNER
I
ADMIT
THIS
HAPPENS
BUT
I
DONLT
THINK
YOU
CAN
SAY
IT
IS
ALWAYS
NECESSAILY
SO
WHY
CAN
WE
NOT
HATE
WITH
A
PERFECT
HATRED
IN
THE
SUMMARY
OF
THE
LAW
CHRIST
COMMANDS
US
TO
LOVE
GOD
AND
TO
LOVE
OUR
NEIGHBORS
HE
DOESNT
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HATE
IN
FACT
IF
ANYTHING
HE
COMMANDS
US
TO
SAVE
OUR
CRITICISMS
FOR
OURSELVES
SO
HOW
ARE
CHRISTIANS
SUPPOSED
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
SIN
OF
OTHERS
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
SIN
EITHER
IN
OTHERS
OR
OURSELVESTHROUGH
PRAYER
WE
CERTAINLY
WE
SHOULD
LOVE
EVEN
OUR
ENEMIES
AMOS
SAYS
TO
HATE
THE
EVIL
AND
LOVE
THE
GOOD
THIS
CANT
CONTRADICT
CHRISTS
TEACHING
I
THINK
WE
TIE
UP
BOTH
HATE
AND
LOVE
WITH
AN
EMOTIONAL
ATTITUDE
WHEN
IT
REALLY
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
MORE
OBJECTIVELY
SURELY
I
DONT
FLY
INTO
A
RAGE
AT
EVERY
SIN
I
SEE
BUT
WHY
CAN
I
NOT
HATE
IT
