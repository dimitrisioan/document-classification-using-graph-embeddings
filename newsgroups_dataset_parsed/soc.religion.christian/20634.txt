WRITES
ON
PALM
SUNDAY
AT
OUR
PARISH
WE
WERE
INVITED
TO
TAKE
THE
ROLE
OF
JESUS
IN
THE
PASSION
I
DECLINED
TO
PARTICIPATE
LAST
YEAR
AT
THE
LITURGY
MEETING
I
POINTED
OUT
HOW
WE
CRUCIFY
CHRIST
BY
OUR
SINS
SO
THEREFORE
IT
IS
APPROPRIATE
THAT
WE
RETAIN
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
CROWD
BUT
TO
NO
AVAIL
MUSICIANS
READERS
AND
SO
ON
NEW
THINGS
ARE
INTRODUCED
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
LITURGY
AND
SINCE
NO
ONE
KNOWS
WHATS
HAPPENING
THE
NEW
THINGS
HAVE
TO
BE
EXPLAINED
AND
PRETTY
SOON
INSTEAD
OF
DOING
A
LOT
OF
THE
MASS
WERE
JUST
SITTING
THERE
LISTENING
OR
SPACING
OUT
IN
MY
CASE
TO
HOW
THE
MASS
IS
ABOUT
TO
BE
DONE
IN
MY
MIND
I
LAY
THE
BLAME
ON
LITURGY
COMMITTEES
MADE
UP
OF
LAY
PEOPLE
TO
BE
AWARE
OF
THE
LORDS
PRESENCE
AS
A
FORMER
CATHOLIC
AND
NOW
AS
A
VERY
ACTIVE
LUTHERAN
IT
IS
SOME
OF
THE
INNOVATIONS
OF
THE
MASS
WHICH
MADE
ME
LEAVE
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
AND
RETURN
TO
THE
MORE
TRADITIONAL
CATHOLIC
CHUCH
THE
LUTHERANS
I
SPENT
MANY
YEARS
AS
A
LECTOR
READING
THE
PASSION
PARTS
AS
APPROPRIATE
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
AND
I
FOUND
IT
VERY
MEANINGFUL
OUR
LUTHERAN
PARISH
JUST
INSTITUTED
THE
TENEBRAE
SERVICE
FOR
GOOD
FRIDAY
AND
I
WAS
THE
LECTOR
FOR
A
PARAPHRASED
PASSION
WHICH
WAS
EXCEPTIONAL
I
HEARD
AND
LEARNED
THINGS
THAT
I
HAVE
PREVIOUSLY
OVERLOOKED
IN
THE
GOSPELS
YET
THOSE
FACTS
WERE
ALWAYS
THERE
AS
A
MATTER
OF
INTEREST
THE
PASTOR
AND
I
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
RC
AND
LUTHERAN
CHURCH
DURING
HOLY
WEEK
OVER
BREAKFAST
EASTER
SUNDAY
AS
A
MEMBER
OF
A
LITURGY
COMMITTEE
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
CERTAIN
PEOPLE
DOMINATING
WHO
WANT
TO
TRY
OUT
ALL
KINDS
OF
INNOVATIONS
THE
PRIESTS
DONT
SEEM
EVEN
TO
WANT
TO
MAKE
ANY
DECISIONS
OF
THEIR
OWN
IN
MANY
CASES
I
GUESS
ITS
EASIER
TO
TRY
SOMETHING
NEW
THAN
IT
IS
TO
REFUSE
TO
ALLOW
IT
MY
WIFE
IS
THE
MEMBER
OF
THE
LITURGY
COMMITTEE
IN
THE
FAMILY
CALLED
MUSIC
AND
WORSHIP
AT
OUR
CHURCH
OUR
PASTOR
DOES
HAVE
CONTROL
OF
THIS
COMMITTEE
BUT
LISTENS
VERY
CAREFULLY
TO
THE
COMMITTEES
SUGGESTIONS
IT
NEEDS
A
STRONG
HAND
TO
LEAD
AND
GUIDE
TO
KEEP
THE
INTENT
AND
THE
MESSAGE
CLEAR
AND
STRONG
AS
IT
SHOULD
BE
THROUGH
LENT
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
LITURGICAL
YEAR
ADDITIONAL
REASON
FOR
MY
LEAVING
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
LACK
OF
ANY
SELFLESS
SPIRITUAL
GUIDANCE
BY
PRIESTS
IN
MY
PARISHES
AKA
WISHYWASHY
AS
YOU
MAY
GATHER
FROM
MY
COMMENTS
I
FEEL
THAT
IT
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
IR
REGARDLESS
OF
DENOMINATIONAL
GUIDELINES
TO
HAVE
A
SERVICEMASS
WHICH
PROMOTES
THE
TRUE
REASON
THAT
WE
ARE
GATHERED
THERE
I
AM
QUITE
COMFORTABLE
IN
A
TRADITIONAL
MASS
WITH
RECEIVING
HOLY
COMMUNION
ON
THE
TONGUE
THE
SACRAMENT
OF
PENANCE
NOT
RECONCILIATION
STATIONS
OF
THE
CROSS
SO
ON
AND
SO
FORTH
THE
REASON
OTHER
TYPES
OF
MASSES
AND
PARISHES
EXIST
IS
BECAUSE
THESE
FEELINGS
ARE
NOT
SHARED
BY
EVERYONE
I
WANT
MORE
PEOPLE
TO
ATTEND
CHURCH
AND
TO
FIND
THE
LORD
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
THEM
ATTENDING
A
SHOW
ITS
NOT
MY
CHURCH
WORKS
HARD
TO
HAVE
A
MEANINGFUL
SERVICE
DURING
LENT
ON
WEDNESDAYS
BUT
FOLLOW
TRADITIONAL
LUTHERAN
BOOK
OF
WORSHIP
GUIDELINES
WHERE
THINGS
ARE
CHANGED
OR
OMITTED
DURING
LENT
SUCH
AS
THE
HYMN
OF
PRAISE
IT
IS
NOTED
SO
THAT
WE
ARE
AWARE
OF
THE
REASONS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THERE
QUITE
FRANKLY
IT
IS
VERY
HARD
FOR
A
NONCATHOLIC
TO
GO
TO
A
MASS
AND
FIT
IN
MY
DEAR
WIFE
NEVER
COULD
FORMER
METHODIST
AND
HOLY
WEEK
MASSES
AND
VIGILS
WOULD
INTIMIDATE
THE
DAYLIGHTS
OUT
OF
A
NONCATHOLIC
THOSE
CATHOLICS
WHO
HAVE
BEARED
WITH
ME
THIS
FAR
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
I
MEAN
PLEASE
KEEP
IN
MIND
WHY
WE
ARE
THERE
TO
GATHER
TOGETHER
IN
WORSHIP
NOT
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
HOW
SOMETHING
IS
DONE
OR
NOT
DONE
IF
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
WRONG
THAT
YOU
FEEL
NEEDS
ADDRESSING
BY
ALL
MEANS
TALK
TO
YOUR
PRIEST
OR
PASTOR
I
HAVE
ONLY
EVER
MET
ONE
WHO
WOULDNT
LISTEN
THEY
ARE
THERE
TO
PROVIDE
SPIRITUAL
GUIDANCE
AND
TO
HELP
USE
THEM
MY
DIFFERENCES
WITH
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
ARE
MUCH
MORE
FUNDAMENTAL
BUT
MY
DECISION
TO
CHANGE
FAITHS
WAS
DONE
WITH
PRAYER
INTERVENTION
AND
SESSIONS
WITH
PRIESTS
AND
MINISTERS

CHRIST
