WROTE
SIMPLY
PUT
I
DO
NOT
SEE
ANY
WAY
THAT
A
PLATONIC
ESSENCE
COULD
HAVE
ANY
REAL
EXISTANCE
ESSENCE
IN
THE
PLATONIC
SENSE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ANY
REFERENT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
IT
IS
JUST
AN
IMAGINARY
CONCEPT
INVENTED
TO
PROVIDE
AN
EXPLANATION
FOR
THINGS
BETTER
EXPLAINED
IN
OTHER
WAYS
YOU
ARE
QUITE
CONFIDENT
THAT
ESSENCES
DO
NOT
EXIST
HOW
DO
PROPOSE
TO
DEFINE
BEINGS
CAN
A
THING
CAN
BE
ONE
WITHOUT
DEFINITION
CAN
A
BEING
HAVE
A

NUMBERS
EXIST
IN
REALITY
AS
ABSTRACT
ENTITIES

WE
INVENT
THEM
THUS
TO
ME
THE
UNITY
OF
GOD
MUST
BE
PRIMARY

THE
TRIALITY
MUST
BE
SECONDARY
MUST
BE
MODAL
OR
ASPECTUAL
RELATING
TO
ROLES
OR
TO
MODES
OF
INTERACTION
SINCE
OTHERWISE
THERE
IS
NO
MEANING
TO
SAYING
GOD
IS
ONE
