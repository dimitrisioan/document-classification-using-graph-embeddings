THE
APOCRAPHA
FALLS
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY

TO
QUOTE
UNGERS
BIBLE
DICTIONARY
ON
THE
APOCRAPHA
THEY
ABOUND
IN
HISTORICAL
AND
GEOGRAPHICAL
INACCURACIES
AND
ANACHRONISMS
THEY
TEACH
DOCTRINES
WHICH
ARE
FALSE
AND
FOSTER
PRACTICES
WHICH
ARE
AT
VARIANCE
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
THEY
RESORT
TO
LITERARY
TYPES
AND
DISPLAY
AN
ARTIFICIALITY
OF
SUBJECT
MATTER
AND
STYLING
OUT
OF
KEEPING
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
THEY
LACK
THE
DISTINCTIVE
ELEMENTS
WHICH
GIVE
GENUINE
SCRIPTURE
THEIR
DIVINE
CHARACTER
SUCH
AS
PROPHETIC
POWER
AND
POETIC
AND
RELIGIOUS
FEELING
FIRST
TO

OUT
THE

WOULD
CLEARLY
BE
A
HIGHLY
SUBJECTIVE

ONE
WOULD
BE
HARD
PRESSED
TO

ANOTHER

THAT

FAIL
ONE
OR
MORE
OF
THE
FIRST
THREE
OF
THESE
TESTS
SECOND
ONE
FACTOR
THE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
SHARE
IS
THE
LATENESS
OF
THEIR
COMPOSITION
I
DONT
RECALL
THE
EXACT
DATING
OF
ALL
OF
THE
BOOKS
BUT
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
WERE
WRITTEN
AFTER
THE
LATEST
OF
THE
CANONICAL
BOOKS
IE
DANIEL
FURTHERMORE
WHILE
THE
DEUTEROCANONICAL
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
ORIGINALLY
WRITTEN
IN
GREEK
THEY
ARE
CLEARLY
DEEPLY
HELLENISTIC
IN
NATURE
BOTH
OF
THESE
FEATURES
PROBABLY
FIGURED
HEAVILY
IN
THE
REJECTION
OF
THESE
BOOKS
FROM
THE
VARIOUS
CANONS
THESE
MAY
NOT
BE
STRICT
AND
UNIFORMLY
APPLICABLE
CRITERIA
BY
WHICH
TO
JUDGE
THE
CANONICITY
OF
THESE
BOOKS
BUT
AS
THESE
DISCUSSIONS
HAVE
SHOWN
I
THINK
THE
ONE
THING
WE
CAN
SEE
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
PURELY
OBJECTIVE
