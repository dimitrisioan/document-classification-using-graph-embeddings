MANY
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
IN
ABSTINENCE
BUT
IN
A
MOMENT
WILL
BE
OVERCOME
BY
DESIRE
WE
ALL
COMPROMISE
AND
RATIONALIZE
POOR
CHOICES
SIN
LAST
WEEK
I
WAS
GUILTY
OF
ANGER
JEALOUSY
AND
WHOLE
MESS
OF
OTHER
STUFF
YET
I
AM
FORGIVEN
AND
NOT
CONDEMNED
TO
SUFFER
WITH
AIDS
TO
EVEN
SUGGEST
THAT
AIDS
IS
DESERVED
IS
LUDICROUS
WHEN
MAN
WAS
TOLD
NOT
TO
HAVE
SEX
WITH
RELATIVES
DID
THEY
LISTEN
NO
AND
MAN
FOUND
OUT
WHY
SO
WHATS
YOUR
POINT
MARKS
COMMENT
STILL
IS
VALID
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
AIDS
IS
DESERVED
IS
LUDICROUS
I
SIN
I
CAN
RESOLVE
TO
ABSTAIN
FROM
SIN
AND
DO
WEEKLY
MORE
OFTEN
ACTUALLY
YET
I
ROUTINELY
FAIL
I
SURELY
DO
DESERVE
WHAT
I
GET
YET
GOD
COMPASSIONATELY
PROVIDED
THE
INCARNATE
LOGOS
JESUS
AS
A
REMEMDY
AND
A
WAY
OUT
OF
OUR
SITUATION
IF
AIDS
IS
DESERVED
I
SURELY
DESERVE
INSTANT
DEATH
JUST
AS
MUCH
AS
DO
WE
ALL
AS
ST
PAUL
SO
COGENTLY
REMIDS
US
TO
WILLINGLY
JUDGE
OTHERS
AS
DESERVING
PUNISHMENT
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
THE
HEIGHT
OF
ARROGANCE
AND
LACK
OF
HUMILITY
I
WONDER
IF
AIDS
WOULD
BE
A
PROBLEM
NOW
IF
PEOPLE
DIDNT
GET
INVOLVED
IN
DEVIANT
SEXUAL
BEHAVIOUR
CERTAINLY
PEOPLE
WHO
RECEIVED
TAINTED
BLOOD
ARE
NOT
TO
BLAME
BUT
IT
JUST
GOES
TO
SHOW
THAT
ALL
MANKIND
IS
AFFECTED
BY
THE
ACTIONS
OF
A
FEW
SO
WHATS
THE
POINT
HERE
I
CAN
GET
AIDS
AND
NEVER
ENGAGE
IN
DEVIANT
SEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
IN
FACT
I
COULD
ENGAGE
IN
LOTS
OF
DEVIANT
SEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
WITH
HIV
PEOPLE
AND
NEVER
BE
INFECTED
AIDS
IS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
PARTICULAR
BEHAVIORS
MANY
OF
WHICH
ARE
NOT
SEXUAL
AND
NOT
ALL
SEXUAL
BEHAVIORS
CARRY
THE
RISK
OF
TRANSMISSION
IN
ADDITION
IMHO
FORGIVENESS
IS
NOT
THE
END
OF
THINGS
THERE
IS
STILL
THE
MATTER
OF
ATONEMENT
IS
IT
AIDS
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
END
OF
ALL
THINGS
IS
TO
KNOW
LOVE
AND
SERVE
GOD
GROWING
DAILY
CLOSER
THROUGH
PRAYER
MEDITATION
AND
DISCIPLINE
EVEN
SO
I
COULD
GET
AIDS
ANYONE
COULD
UNLESS
THEY
REMAIN
FOREVER
CELIBATE
IVDRUGFREE
AND
TRANSFUSION
FREE
