i
would
like
to
get
your
opinions
on
this
when
exactly
does
an
engaged
couple
become
married
in
gods
eyes
not
if
they
are
unwilling
to
go
through
a
public
marriage
ceremony
nor
if
they
say
they
are
willing
but
have
not
actually
done
so
lets
distinguish
real
logistical
problems
like
being
stranded
on
a
desert
island
from
excuses
such
as
waiting
for
soandsos
brother
to
come
back
from
being
in
the
army
so
he
can
be
in
the
ceremony
i
disagree
people
marry
each
other
when
they
commit
fully
to
each
other
as
life
partners
they
are
married
the
ceremony
may
assist
in
emphasizing
the
depth
of
such
a
commitment
but
is
of
itself
nothing
god
knows
our
hearts
he
knows
when
two
have
committed
themselves
to
be
one
he
knows
the
fears
and
delusions
we
have
that
keep
us
from
fully
giving
ourselves
to
another
the
way
i
see
it
youd
have
to
be
living
together
in
a
marriage
for
somewhere
between
and
years
before
anyone
knew
if
a
marriage
really
existed
but
god
knows
i
dont
think
god
keeps
a
scorebook
