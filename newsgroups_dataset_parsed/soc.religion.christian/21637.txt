ANOTHER
WORK

THIS
IS
AN
EDITION
OF
TEXT
OF
ACTS
THAT
MAKES
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
TEXT
IN
CODEX
BEZAE
IS
THE
MORE
AUTHENTIC
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
ACTUALLY
CONTAINS
AN
ENGLISH
TRANSLATION
OR
NOT
ANOTHER
USEFUL
THAT
DISCUSSES
MANY
OF
THE
VARIANTS

THE
MOST

REFERENCE
I

WAS
AN

FROM

EARLY
I
CAN
SUPPLY
THE
REFERENCE
IF
ANYONES
INTERESTED
NOW
MANY
OF
THE
WORKS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
FIND
SO
IF
YOURE
INTERESTED
IN
EXAMINING
THE
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
LONG
RECENSION
AN
EXCELLENT
AND
EASILY
OBTAINABLE
DISCUSSION
CAN
BE

OF

A

FULL
REPORT
WITH
AN

OF
THE
SEVERAL
ADDITIONS
AND
OTHER
MODIFICATIONS
THAT
ARE
ATTESTED
BY
WESTERN
WITNESSES
SINCE
MANY
OF
THESE
HAVE
NO
CORRESPONDING
APPARATUS
IN
THE
TEXTVOLUME
CARE
WAS
TAKEN
TO
SUPPLY
AN
ADEQUATE
CONSPECTUS
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
THAT
SUPPORTS
THE
DIVERGENT
READINGS
P
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
EARLY
CODEXES
VATICANUS
AND
SINIATICUS
HAS
THIS
VERSION
OF
ACTS
IT
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
TO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
DIFFERENCES
ARE
BETWEEN
THE
LONG
AND
THE
SHORT
FORMS
MOST
OF
THE
COPIES
OF
THE
TEXT
OF
ACTS
THAT
WE
HAVE
INCLUDING
THE
ONES
IN
VATICANUS
AND
SINIATICUS
ADHER
PRETTY
CLOSELY
TO
THE
SHORTER
OR
ALEXANDRIAN
VERSION
THE
LONGER
VERSION
TO
WHICH
YOU
REFER
IS
USUALLY
CALLED
THE
WESTERN
VERSION
AND
ITS
MAIN
WITNESS
IS
THE
CODEX
BEZAE
ALTHOUGHT
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
OTHER
RATHER
FRAGMENTARY
SOURCES
AS
FAR
AS
SIZE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
IN
CLARKS
EDITION
MENTIONED
ABOVE
THE
BOOK
OF
ACTS
CONTAINS
WORDS
WHEREAS
THE
TEXT
EDITED
BY
WESTCOTT
AND
HORT
A
TYPICAL
ALEXANDRIAN
TEXT
CONTAINS
WORDS
IE
A
DIFFERENCE
OF
ABOUT
TO
ANSWER
THE
OBVIOUS
QUESTIONS
NO
THERE
ARE
NO
MAJOR
REVELATIONS
IN
THE
LONGER
TEXT
NOR
MAJOR
OMISSIONS
IN
THE
SHORTER
TEXT
THE
MAIN
DIFFERENCE
SEEMS
TO
EXPANSION
OF
DETAIL
IN
THE
WESTERN
TEXT
OR
IF
YOU
PREFER
CONTRACTIONS
IN
THE
ALEXANDRIAN
THE
WESTERN
TEXT
SEEMS
TO
BE
GIVEN
TO
MORE
DETAIL
THERE
ARE
SOME
INTERESTING
SPECIFIC
CASES
BUT
THIS
PROBABLY
NOT
THE
PLACE
TO
GO
INTO
IT
IN
DETAIL
THE
DISCUSSION
OVER
THE
YEARS
AS
TO
WHICH
OF
THESE
VERSIONS
IS
THE
MORE
AUTHENTIC
HAS
BEEN
HOT
AND
HEAVY
IF
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
APPROACHING
A
MODERN
CONSENSUS
IT
IS
I
THAT
NEITHER
TEXT
REPRESENTS
PURELY
THE
AUTHENTIC
VERSION
II
EACH
VARIANT
READING
HAS
TO
BE
EXAMINED
ON
ITS
OWN
MERITS
HOWEVER

THE
