MARY
AND
IDOLS
I
HAVE
BEEN
STUDYING
THE
BIBLE
NOW
FOR
ABOUT
A
YEAR
I
LOVE
IT
BUT
I
AM
NOT
VERY
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
DIFFERENT
DENOMINATIONS
OR
TRADITIONS
OR
COMMON
BELIEFS
OF
VARIOUS
CHRISTIAN
GROUPS
I
HAVE
HEARD
VARIOUS
PEOPLE
OUTSIDE
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
DESCRIBE
IDOLS
SUCH
AS
POWER
MONEY
MATERIAL
POSSESSIONS
ETC
THESE
THINGS
ARE
WORSHIPED
IN
SOME
SENSE
I
SUPPOSE
BUT
I
NEVER
REALLY
GAVE
IDOLS
MUCH
THOUGHT
UNTIL
NOW
I
HAVE
BEEN
READING
THE
POSTINGS
IN
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
WHICH
I
JUST
FOUND
A
FEW
DAYS
AGO
AND
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
FIRST
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
QUESTION
ANYONES
BELIEF
OR
TRY
TO
PUSH
MY
VIEWS
ON
ANYONE
ELSE
I
HAVENT
BEEN
AT
THIS
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
ANY
VIEWS
OTHER
THAN
I
CANNOT
GET
TO
HEAVEN
BY
BEING
GOOD
I
MUST
UNDERSTAND
THAT
CHRIST
BORE
MY
SINS
ON
THE
CROSS
SO
THAT
I
COULD
BE
SAVED
AND
I
NEED
TO
REPENT
IE
REALIZE
THAT
EVERY
TIME
I
SIN
I
MIGHT
AS
WELL
STICK
A
SHARP
STICK
IN
CHRISTS
SIDE
BECAUSE
HE
TOOK
THE
PUNISHMENT
FOR
MY
SINS
WHEN
HE
DIED
ON
THE
CROSS
IN
MY
STUDIES
MARY
NEVER
REALLY
COMES
UP
I
KNOW
WHO
SHE
IS
BUT
THATS
ABOUT
IT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
A
STATUE
OF
MARY
COULD
BE
CONSIDERED
AN
IDOL
DO
PEOPLE
PRAY
TO
STATUES
OF
MARY
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
EDUCATED
CHRISTIANS
MORE
EDUCATED
THAN
MYSELF
IM
SURE
BELIEVE
MARY
WAS
SINLESS
WOW
I
HOPED
TO
SPEND
THE
SUMMER
CONVINCING
MYSELF
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
ABOUT
TONGUES
IM
READING
CHARISMATIC
CHAOS
I
GUESS
ILL
STUDY
TONGUES
IN
PARALLEL
WITH
READING
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
ANY
HELP
YOU
CAN
GIVE
ME
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED
I
DONT
THINK
THE
ISSUE
IS
SO
MUCH
THAT
PEOPLE
ARE
MORE
EDUCATED
THAN
YOU
THOUGH
IT
MAY
WELL
BE
THAT
THEY
ARE
AS
THAT
THEY
COME
FROM
A
DIFFERENT
TRADITION
THAN
YOURS
THIS
IS
A
DISCUSSION
BETWEEN
CATHOLICS
AND
PROTESTANTS
CATHOLICS
GENERALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
MARY
WAS
SINLESS
PROTESTANTS
DO
NOT
THE
ISSUE
COMES
DOWN
TO
DIFFERENT
SOURCES
OF
AUTHORITY
PROTESTANTS
GENERALLY
LIMIT
THEMSELVES
TO
THE
BIBLE
AS
A
SOURCE
OF
DOCTRINE
SINCE
THIS
ISNT
IN
THE
BIBLE
EXCEPT
IN
PASSAGES
THAT
NO
ONE
WOULD
UNDERSTAND
IN
THIS
WAY
IF
THEY
DIDNT
ALREADY
BELIEVE
IT
PROTESTANTS
DONT
ACCEPT
IT
CATHOLICS
SEE
CONTINUING
REVELATION
THROUGH
THE
CHURCH
THOUGH
THEY
BELIEVE
THE
RESULTS
ARE
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
BIBLE
I
INTERPRET
YOUR
POSTING
NOT
AS
A
CALL
FOR
YET
ANOTHER
ARGUMENT
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
CATHOLIC
MARIAN
DEVOTIONS
ARE
IDOLATRY
AN
ARGUMENT
I
AM
NOT
PREPARED
TO
SEE
NEWED
HERE
BUT
AS
A
SIGN
OF
BEING
INTERESTED
IN
LEARNING
ABOUT
TRADITIONS
OTHER
THAN
YOUR
OWN
CATHOLICS
ARE
OF
COURSE
A
MAJOR
ONE
BUT
BY
NO
MEANS
THE
ONLY
ONE
I
GENERALLY
CONSIDER
THE
MAJOR
TRADITIONS
TO
BE
CATHOLIC
ORTHODOX
AND
VARIOUS
SUBSETS
OF
PROTESTANTISM
WITHIN
PROTESTANTISM
ITS
A
MATTER
OF
HOW
FINELY
YOU
WANT
TO
CUT
THINGS
THESE
DAYS
I
THINK
THE
MAJOR
DIVISION
IS
BETWEEN
THOSE
WHO
ACCEPT
BIBLICAL
INERRANCY
AND
THOSE
WHO
DONT
THERE
ARE
ALSO
A
NUMBER
OF
MAJOR
HISTORICAL
TRADITIONS
BUT
IN
RECENT
DECADES
DISTINCTIONS
ARE
TENDING
TO
BLUR
ID
IDENTIFY
THE
MAJOR
PROTESTANT
TRADITIONS
AS
LUTHERAN
REFORMED
ANGLICAN
THEYRE
SORT
OF
HALFWAY
BETWEEN
CATHOLIC
AND
PROTESTANT
WESLEYAN
BAPTIST
HOLINESS
PENTECOSTAL
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
BUT
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHERS
HISTORICAL
DISTINCTIONS
TEND
NOT
TO
BE
SO
IMPORTANT
AMONG
THE
LIBERAL
CHURCHES
ANYMORE
AND
I
THINK
CURRENT
TRENDS
IN
SOCIETY
AND
THE
CHURCH
ARE
ALSO
TENDING
TO
MAKE
CONSERVATIVES
SEEN
THEMSELVES
AS
ALLIES
FROM
A
GENERAL
EVANGELICAL
PERSPECTIVE
BUT
DIFFERENCES
AMONG
THESE
VARIOUS
TRADITIONS
ARE
STILL
QUITE
MARKED
I
THINK
THE
BEST
INTRODUCTION
TO
THESE
ISSUES
IS
TO
READ
A
GOOD
BOOK
ON
CHURCH
HISTORY
ANYONE
WHO
WANTS
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
CHURCH
REALLY
NEEDS
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
WE
GOT
WHERE
WE
ARE
NOW
A
CHURCH
HISTORY
WILL
NORMALLY
SHOW
YOU
WHERE
EACH
OF
THESE
TRADITIONS
CAME
FROM
AND
GIVE
A
FEELING
FOR
THEIR
NATURE
UNFORTUNATELY
IM
AWAY
FROM
MY
LIBRARY
AT
THE
MOMENT
SO
I
DONT
HAVE
ANYTHING
SPECIFIC
TO
RECOMMEND
CLH
