RE
LOSING
YOUR
TEMPER
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
TRAIT
HOORAY
I
ALWAYS
SUSPECTED
THAT
I
WAS
HUMAN
TOO
IT
IS
THE
DESIRE
TO
BE
LIKE
CHRIST
THAT
OFTEN
CAUSES
CHRISTIANS
TO
BE
VERY
CRITICAL
OF
THEMSELVES
AND
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
WE
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
GROW
MATURE
ENDEAVOUR
TO
BE
CHRISTLIKE
BUT
WE
ARE
FAR
FAR
FAR
FROM
PERFECT
BUILD
UP
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
DONT
TEAR
IT
DOWN
AND
THAT
INCLUDES
YOURSELF
JESUS
LOVES
ME
JUST
THE
WAY
I
AM
TODAY
TOMORROW
AND
ALWAYS
THANK
GOD
