RE
GOD
MORALITY
AND
MASSACRES
JEKCUNIHGOV
JAMES
KIEFER
WRITES
STUFF
DELETED
FIRST
POINT
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
IS
WRONG
JUST
AS
WHAT
JOSEPHS
BROTHERS
DID
WAS
WRONG
JUST
AS
WHAT
JUDAS
DID
WAS
WRONG
THEY
INTEND
IT
FOR
EVIL
IF
GOD
SOMEHOW
BRINGS
GOOD
OUT
OF
IT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
THEM
ANY
LESS
SUBJECT
TO
JUST
CONDEMNATION
AND
PUNISHMENT
SECOND
POINT
OF
COURSE
GOD
WILL
BRING
GOOD
OUT
OF
IT
BUT
NOT
THE
SAME
GOOD
THAT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BROUGHT
IF
THE
SERBIANS
HAD
REFRAINED
FROM
THE
SINS
OF
ROBBERY
AND
RAPE
AND
MURDER
NOR
DOES
THE
GOOD
HE
PURPOSES
EXCUSE
US
FROM
THE
DUTY
OF
DOING
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
SO
WHAT
YOURE
SAYING
THEN
IS
THAT
GOD
EXERCISES
DIRECT
CONTROL
OR
INFLUENCE
UPON
HUMANITY
HE
DOESNT
CONTROL
OUR
EVERY
THOUGHT
OR
ACTION
BUT
TAKES
WHAT
WE
DO
WHETHER
IT
BE
INTENDED
FOR
EVIL
OR
NOT
AND
TURNS
IT
INTO
SOMETHING
GOOD
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
IDEA
CONFLICTS
WITH
THE
BELIEF
THAT
GOD
GAVE
HUMANS
FREE
WILL
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
DETERMINE
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
RECONCILE
THESE
TWO
DIFFERENT
IDEAS
IF
GOD
WERE
TO
EXERT
HIS
INFLUENCE
UPON
ANYONE
OR
ANYTHING
AT
ANYTIME
HE
WOULD
BE
IMPEDING
UPON
SOMEONES
FREE
WILL
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
DID
NOT
GIVE
US
COMPLETE
AND
UNABATED
FREE
WILL
BUT
RATHER
SOME
SORT
OF
CONDITIONAL
FREE
WILL
SOMETHING
THAT
ALLOWS
US
TO
MAKE
OUR
OWN
CHOICES
AND
CONTROL
OUR
OWN
LIVES
EXCEPT
WHEN
GOD
WANTS
TO
USE
US
TO
FULFILL
SOME
GOOD
PURPOSE
OF
HIS
OWN
BY
HARDENING
OUR
HEART
OR
CONTROLLING
US
IN
SOME
OTHER
WAY
I
HEAR
ALOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
LOOK
AT
VARIOUS
EVENTS
MOSTLY
CATASTROPHIES
OR
THINGS
LIKE
THE
AIDS
EPIDEMIC
AND
MAKE
COMMENTS
ABOUT
GODS
WILL
I
HAVE
A
VERY
DIFFICULT
TIME
UNDERSTANDING
WHY
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
CONTROLS
ANYTHING
THAT
HAPPENS
ON
THIS
PLANET
EXCEPT
POSSIBLY
WHEN
BEING
ASKED
TO
THROUGH
SOMEONES
PRAYER
ACCORDING
TO
THE
BIBLE
PHAROAH
WAS
GOING
TO
LET
MOSES
PEOPLE
GO
AFTER
ONE
OR
TWO
PLAGUES
BUT
GOD
KEPT
HARDENING
HIS
HEART
SO
MOSES
COULD
CAST
ALL
PLAGUES
UPON
THE
EGYPTIANS
THE
LAST
PLAGUE
CAUSING
THE
DEATH
OF
MANY
INNOCENT
CHILDREN
SO
THEN
GOD
IMPEDED
UPON
PHAROAHS
FREE
WILL
AND
USED
HIM
AS
A
PUPPET
GOD
DID
THIS
NOT
JUST
TO
FREE
THE
HEBREWS
BUT
TO
FREE
THEM
IN
SOME
SORT
OF
A
GRAND
FASHION
I
SUPPOSE
FROM
THE
HEBREWS
POINT
OF
VIEW
THIS
COULD
BE
SEEN
AS
TURNING
SOMETHING
BAD
INTO
GOOD
BUT
IM
SURE
THE
EGYPTIANS
DIDNT
SEE
IT
THIS
WAY
ALL
OF
YOUR
EXAMPLES
OF
HOW
GOD
TURNED
SOMETHING
BAD
INTO
SOMETHING
GOOD
ARE
BASED
UPON
SHOWING
FAVORTISM
TO
ONE
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
OVER
ANOTHER
AFTER
ALL
ITS
ONLY
GOOD
BASED
UPON
YOUR
POINT
OF
VIEW
WHY
DOES
GOD
WHO
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THE
GOD
OF
ALL
OF
HUMANITY
PLAY
