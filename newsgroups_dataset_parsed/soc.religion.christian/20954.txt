RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
A
PREVIOUS
MESSAGE
MARK
BAKER
WRITES
IF
I
DONT
THINK
MY
BELIEF
IS
RIGHT
AND
EVERYONE
ELSES
BELIEF
IS
WRONG
THEN
I
DONT
HAVE
A
BELIEF
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
WHAT
BELIEF
MEANS
MORE
STUFF
DELETED
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
PRETTY
AROGANT
DEFINITION
OF
BELIEF
MY
BELIEFS
ARE
THOSE
THINGS
WHICH
I
FIND
TO
BE
TRUE
BASED
ON
MY
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
WORLD
THIS
EXPERIENCE
INCLUDES
STUDY
OF
THINGS
THAT
I
MAY
NOT
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
DIRECTLY
BUT
EVEN
THEN
I
CAN
ONLY
UNDERSTAND
THE
STUDIES
TO
THE
EXTENT
TO
WHICH
I
CAN
RELATE
WHAT
I
STUDY
BACK
TO
WHAT
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
WHICH
MEANS
THAT
BY
BELIEFS
ABOUT
GOD
ARE
DIRECTLY
RELATED
TO
MY
EXPERIENCE
OF
GOD
HAVING
EXPERIENCED
GOD
I
TRY
TO
MAKE
SENSE
OF
THAT
EXPERIENCE
I
STUDY
RELIGION
AND
READ
THE
BIBLE
I
FIND
THINGS
THAT
ECHO
WHAT
I
HAVE
ALREADY
EXPERIENCED
OUT
OF
THIS
I
BUILD
MY
BELIEFS
I
ALSO
FIND
THINGS
THAT
DONT
MATCH
MY
EXPERIENCE
THAT
DOESNT
MAKE
THEM
FALSE
THEY
JUST
DONT
MATCH
MY
EXPERIENCE
MAYBE
I
WILL
UNDERSTAND
THAT
STUFF
LATER
I
DONT
KNOW
MAYBE
ALL
OF
MY
BELIEFS
ARE
WRONG
I
CAN
CHANGE
MY
BELIEFS
IF
SOMEONE
ELSE
HAS
BELIEFS
THAT
ARE
DIFFERENT
FROM
MINE
SO
WHAT
NEITHER
OF
US
ARE
NECESSARILY
WRONG
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
MAKING
SENSE
OUT
OF
A
DIFFERENT
SET
OF
EXPERIENCES
EVEN
THOUGH
WE
HAVE
DIFFERENT
EXPLANATIONS
AND
BELIEFS
IF
WE
TALK
WE
MIGHT
EVEN
DISCOVER
THAT
THE
UNDERLYING
EXPERIENCES
ARE
SIMILAR
SOME
PEOPLE
APPROACH
RELIGION
AS
A
TRUTH
THAT
CAN
ONLY
EXIST
IN
ONE
FORM
AND
USUALLY
HAS
A
SINGLE
REVELATION
THE
MORE
DOGMATIC
AND
INFLEXIBLE
THE
BELIEF
SYSTEM
THE
MORE
ARROGANT
IT
WILL
APPEAR
TO
AN
OUTSIDER
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
APPROACH
POSSIBLE
HOWEVER
GOD
IS
A
MYSTERY
I
AM
TRYING
TO
SOLVE
THE
MYSTERY
SO
I
LOOK
AT
THE
EVIDENCE
AVAILABLE
TO
ME
I
TRY
TO
ARRIVE
AT
THE
BEST
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
I
CAN
BASED
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
NEW
EVIDENCE
MAY
CAUSE
ME
TO
CHANGE
MY
UNDERSTANDING
WHEN
I
ENCOUNTER
SOMEONE
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
BELIEF
THAN
MY
OWN
IT
ISNT
A
THREAT
IT
IS
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
PERHAPS
DISCOVER
SOMETHING
NEW
ABOUT
THIS
MYSTERY
I
CAN
NEVER
FULLY
COMPREHEND
