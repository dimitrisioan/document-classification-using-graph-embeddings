black
sabbath
in
looking
through
my
files
this
weekend
i
ran
across
some
lyrics
from
various
rock
groups
that
have
content
here
are
two
from
black
sabbaths
master
of
reality
ill
say
this
much
for
the
music
of
the
and
early
at
least
they
asked
questions
of
significance
jethro
tull
is
another
to
asked
and
wrote
about
things
that
caused
one
to
wonder
rex
after
forever
have
you
ever
thought
about
your
soul
can
it
be
saved
or
perhaps
you
think
that
when
youre
dead
you
just
stay
in
you
grave
is
god
just
a
thought
within
you
read
in
a
book
when
you
were
at
school
when
you
think
about
death
do
you
lose
your
breath
or
do
you
keep
your
cool
would
you
like
to
see
the
pope
on
the
end
of
a
rope
do
you
think
hes
a
fool
well
i
have
seen
the
truth
yes
i
have
seen
the
light
and
ive
changed
my
ways
and
ill
be
prepared
when
youre
lonely
and
scared
at
the
end
of
your
days
could
it
be
youre
afraid
of
what
your
friends
might
say
if
they
knew
you
believed
in
god
above
they
should
realize
before
they
criticise
that
god
is
the
only
way
to
love
is
your
mind
so
small
that
you
have
to
fall
in
with
the
pack
wherever
they
run
will
you
still
sneer
when
death
is
near
and
say
they
may
as
well
worship
the
sun
i
think
it
was
true
it
was
people
like
you
that
crucified
christ
i
think
it
is
sad
the
opinion
you
had
was
the
only
one
voiced
will
you
be
so
sure
when
your
day
is
near
to
say
you
dont
believe
you
had
the
chance
but
you
turned
it
down
now
you
cant
retrieve
perhaps
youll
think
before
you
say
that
god
is
dead
gone
open
your
eyes
just
realize
that
he
is
the
one
the
only
one
who
can
save
you
now
from
all
this
sin
and
hate
or
will
you
still
jeer
at
all
you
hear
yes
i
think
its
too
late
lord
of
this
world
youre
searching
for
your
mind
dont
know
where
to
start
cant
find
the
key
to
fit
the
lock
on
your
heart
you
think
you
know
but
you
are
never
quite
sure
your
soul
is
ill
but
you
will
not
find
a
cure
your
world
was
made
for
you
by
someone
above
but
you
choose
evil
ways
instead
of
love
you
made
me
master
of
the
world
where
you
exist
the
soul
i
took
from
you
was
not
even
missed
lord
of
the
world
evil
possessor
lord
of
this
world
hes
now
your
confessor
you
think
youre
innocent
youve
nothing
to
fear
you
dont
know
me
you
say
but
isnt
it
clear
you
turned
to
me
in
all
your
worldly
greed
and
pride
but
will
you
turn
to
me
when
it
your
turn
to
die
