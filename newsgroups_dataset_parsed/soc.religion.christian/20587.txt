WE
AFFIRM
THE
ABSOLUTES
OF
SCRIPTURE
NOT
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
ARROGANT
MORALISTS
BUT
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
WHO
IS
TRUTH
WHO
HAS
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTH
IN
HIS
WORD
AND
THEREFORE
WE
HOLD
AS
PRECIOUS
THE
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
OF
THOSE
ABSOLUTES
PARDON
ME
A
HUMBLE
ATHEIST
BUT
EXACTLY
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
HOLDING
A
REVEALED
TRUTH
WITH
BLIND
FAITH
AS
ITS
BASIS
IE
REGARDLESS
OF
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
YOU
MAY
FIND
TO
THE
CONTRARY
AS
AN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
FULLY
EXPECTING
PEOPLE
TO
BELIEVE
YOU
AND
ARROGANCE
IF
YOU
WOULD
BOTHER
TO
CHECK
IN
ANY
GOOD
DICTIOANRY
OR
THESAURUS
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
ARROGANCE
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
AN
OFFENSIVE
EXHIBITION
OF
PRESUMED
OR
REAL
SUPERIORITY
A
PARAPHRASE
FROM
MY
OWN
WEBSTERS
ARROGNACE
IS
ABOUT
PRIDE
AND
HAUGHTINESS
A
PERSON
CAN
BELIEVE
IN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
EVEN
BLINDLY
WHATEVER
THAT
MEANS
WITHOUT
BEING
OBNOXIOUS
ABOUT
IT
JUST
AS
A
PERSON
CAN
BE
A
HUMBLE
AUTHORITYQUESTIONING

ATHIEST
AND
BE
QUITE
ARROGANT
ARROGANCE
IS
NOT
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
BELIEVE
IT
IS
ABOUT
HOW
YOU
RELATE
TO
WHAT
YOU
BELIEVE
AND
HOW
YOU
PRESENT
IT
TO
OTHERS
IF
YOUR
OVERWHELMING
EXPERIENCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
HAS
BEEN
THAT
THEY
ARE
ARROGANT
I
APOLOGOZING
BOTH
FOR
MYSELF
AND
ON
THE
BEHALF
OF
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
OFFFENDED
YOU
BUT
MY
OWN
EXPERIENCE
AT
LEAST
IN
FORUMS
LIKE
USENET
WHERE
YOU
SEE
A
GOOD
MIX
OF
PEOPLE
IS
THAT
ARROGANT
CHRISTIANS
AND
ATHIESTS

TO
OCCUR
IN
