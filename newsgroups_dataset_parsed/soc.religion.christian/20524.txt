the
word
for
the
celebration
of
the
resurrection
is
paquesthis
is
etymologically
related
to
pesach
passover
and
the
pascal
lamb
so
is
the
french
canadian
mostly
roman
catholic
celebration
better
because
it
uses
the
right
name
i
was
at
my
parents
seder
and
noticed
the
labelling
on
one
of
the
packages
was
english
hebrew
and
french
in
the
phrase
kosher
for
passover
the
french
word
used
was
paques
weve
deliberately
mistranslated
this
at
the
kulikauskas
home
and
keep
referring
to
foods
being
kosher
for
easter
however
the
word
paques
in
french
is
the
word
for
easter
ask
any
francophone
whether
from
quebec
or
from
paris
besides
havent
you
heard
of
the
phrase
the
paschal
lamb
meaning
jesus
sorry
