MAARTEN
VAN
LOON
WRITES
HELLO
FELLOWNETTERS
AND
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
ABOUT
THE
SUBJECT
OF
UNITY
BETWEEN
CHRISTIANS
AND
CHRISTIAN
CHURCHES
TO
A
BIBLE
STUDY
GROUP
ALLTOUGH
I
DO
HAVE
A
PERSONAL
OPINION
ON
THIS
ISSUE
I
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
HEAR
OPINIONS
OF
FELLOW
CHRISTIAN
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
FROM
DIFFERENT
COUNTRIES
AND
IN
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
MY
BACKGROUND
MEMBER
OF
A
ORTHODOX
REFORMED
CHURCH
LET
US
SAY
A
LITTLE
THE
ONLY
UNITY
IVE
FOUND
WHICH
IS
TRUE
IS
WHEN
ALL
PARTIES
INVOLVED
ARE
DISCIPLES
I
CAME
OUT
OF
A
CHURCH
IN
WHICH
EVEN
THE
DIFFERENT
CONGREGATIONS
WERE
ALWAYS
COMPETING
AND
ARGUING
ABOUT
WHICH
ONE
WAS
BETTER
AND
WHO
HAD
THE
BETTER
MESSAGES
WHILE
NONE
OF
THEM
PUT
ANYTHING
INTO
PRACTICE
FROM
THOSE
MESSAGES
SINCE
BECOMING
A
DISCIPLE
IVE
FOUND
THAT
WHEN
I
TRAVEL
TO
ANOTHER
CHURCH
IN
THE
SAME
MOVEMENT
THEY
ARE
JUST
AS
ACCEPTING
THERE
AS
ANY
OTHER
WE
HAD
A
RETREAT
BACK
IN
JANUARY
WHEN
SOME
OF
THE
CONGREGATION
FROM
LOUISVILLE
KY
CAME
UP
THIS
RETREAT
WAS
FOR
COLLEGE
STUDENTS
AND
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
KNOWN
EVEN
THE
PEOPLE
FROM
LOUISVILLE
FOR
YEARS
AND
I
HAD
ONLY
BECOME
A
DISCIPLE
THE
PREVIOUS
APRIL
AND
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
TO
THE
CHURCH
IN
KENTUCKY
ONE
OF
THE
KEYS
TO
UNITY
IS
UNSELFISH
LOVE
AND
SELFSACRIFICE
THAT
IS
ONLY
ONE
AREA
IN
WHICH
DISCIPLES
STAND
OUT
FROM
CHRISTIANS
ALSO
ANOTHER
PART
OF
UNITY
IS
A
COMMON
DEPTH
OF
CONVICTION
IVE
ALSO
BEEN
A
PART
OF
SOME
CHRISTIAN
CAMPUS
FELLOWSHIPS
WHO
WERE
FOCUSED
ON
UNITY
BETWEEN
CHURCHES
AND
SAW
THAT
THOSE
CHURCHES
HAD
ONE
THING
INVOLVED
A
LACK
OF
CONVICTION
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
THEY
BELIEVED
THAT
WAS
WHY
THEY
COULD
BE
UNIFIED
THEY
DIDNT
CARE
ABOUT
THE
TRUTH
BUT
DELIGHTED
IN
GETTING
ALONG
TOGETHER
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IN
THE
NETHERLANDS
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
OTHER
CHURCHES
DENOMINATIONS
WITH
THE
SAME
CHARACTERISTICS
BOTH
HAVE
THE
SAME
CONFESSIONS
THERE
ARE
ONLY
SOME
DIFFERENCES
WITH
RESPECT
TO
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
MATTER
OF
APPROPRIATION
OF
SALVATION
AND
HOW
TO
USE
OUR
CREEDS
IN
ESSENCE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
OF
THESE
THREE
CHURCHES
HAVE
TO
SAME
FAITH
AND
FEEL
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
BECOME
ONE
CHURCH
BUT
HOW
THAT
IS
THE
QUESTION
CREEDS
WHAT
NEED
IS
THERE
OF
CREEDS
WHEN
THE
BIBLE
STANDS
FIRMLY
BETTER
SO
HERE
IS
A
FIRST
QUESTION
CAN
THE
CONGREGATION
OF
CHRIST
BE
SEPARATED
BY
WALLS
OF
DIFFERENT
DENOMINATIONS
OR
IS
THIS
DEFINITELY
AN
UNTOLERABLE
SITUATION
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SCRIPTURES
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SCRIPTURES
SPLITS
AND
DIFFERENCES
OF
OPINION
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
THERE
AS
PER
A
PREVIOUS
NOTE
I
MENTIONED
THAT
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
TEACH
FALSELY
BY
MANY
MEANS
THERE
ARE
ALSO
DIFFERENCES
OF
OPINION
AND
BELIEF
HOWEVER
SCRIPTURE
STATES
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
DIRECTIVES
I
HAVE
NO
PRAISE
FOR
YOU
FOR
YOUR
MEETINGS
DO
MORE
HARM
THAN
GOOD
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
I
HEAR
THAT
WHEN
YOU
COME
TOGETHER
AS
A
CHURCH
THERE
RE
DIVISIONS
AMONG
YOU
AND
TO
SOME
EXTENT
I
BELIEVE
IT
NO
DOUBT
THERE
HAVE
TO
BE
DIFFERENCES
AMONG
YOU
TO
SHOW
WHICH
OF
YOU
HAVE
GODS
APPROVAL
CORINTHIANS
HOW
WILL
GOD
SHOW
HIS
APPROVAL
BY
FRUITFULNESS
SEE
ACTS
BUT
BEFORE
THAT
THERE
ARE
THESE
QUALITIES
DEVOTION
TO
THE
APOSTLES
TEACHING
FELLOWSHIP
COMMUNION
FILLING
WITH
AWE
FOR
GOD
ALL
HAVING
EVERYTHING
IN
COMMON
GLAD
AND
SINCERE
HEARTS
PRAISING
GOD
ENJOYING
THE
FAVOR
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ALL
THESE
ARE
MENTIONED
IN
ACTS
GOD
ALSO
SHOWS
THAT
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
THESE
QUALITIES
ARE
PERSECUTED
LOOK
AT
STEPHEN
A
MAN
FULL
OF
FAITH
AND
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
ACTS
WHO
WAS
LATER
STONED
ACTS
CAN
ONE
SAY
THAT
ONLY
ONE
OF
THESE
THREE
CHURCHES
IS
THE
TRUE
CHURCH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
ONE
CAN
SAY
THAT
A
CHURCH
IS
THE
TRUE
CHURCH
ONLY
IF
THAT
CHURCH
IS
PERFECT
NOT
ONLY
IN
THE
CONGREGATION
BUT
WORLDWIDE
AS
A
MOVEMENT
I
HAVE
YET
TO
FIND
THAT
BUT
THE
CLOSEST
ONE
IVE
FOUND
IS
THE
BOSTON
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
MOVEMENT
WHICH
CONSTANTLY
STRIVES
TO
HAVE
ERRORS
POINTED
OUT
AND
CORRECTED
IT
IS
ALSO
THE
ONLY
ONE
IVE
SEEN
WHICH
IS
TOTALLY
SOLD
OUT
TO
GOD
A
PROBLEM
CLOSELY
RELATED
TO
THESE
QUESTION
IS
CAN
WE
COOPERATE
WITH
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
FROM
THESE
TWO
CHURCHES
BEFORE
THERE
IS
A
UNITY
THIS
QUESTION
IS
ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT
FOR
THOSE
WHO
THINK
THAT
ONLY
ONE
CHURCH
CAN
BE
THE
TRUE
ONE
AS
FOR
COOPERATION
THAT
CAN
ALWAYS
OCCUR
UNITY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MAY
NEVER
OCCUR
AS
FOR
THOSE
WHO
THINK
ABOUT
ONLY
ONE
CHURCH
BEING
THE
TRUE
ONE
I
REMIND
THEM
THAT
MARK
STATES
THAT
THERE
ARE
DISCIPLES
WHO
ARE
NOT
A
PART
OF
THE
MAIN
GROUP
TO
BEGIN
WITH
BUT
THEY
WILL
NOT
LOSE
THEIR
REWARD
AS
WITH
THE
BOSTON
MOVEMENT
IVE
HEARD
NUMEROUS
TIMES
THIS
EXACT
SAME
THING
THAT
THERE
ARE
DISCIPLES
OUT
THERE
THAT
ARE
NOT
A
PART
OF
THE
BOSTON
MOVEMENT
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
THEM
ANY
LESS
DISCIPLES
OF
COURSE
FEW
PEOPLE
ADMIT
THAT
THEYVE
EVER
RUN
INTO
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
THE
QUALITIES
OF
A
DISCIPLE
OUTSIDE
THE
MOVEMENT
I
KNOW
I
HAVENT
MAYBE
THIS
LAST
PROBLEM
SOUNDS
A
LITTLE
STRANGE
TO
MOST
OF
YOU
FOR
YOUR
INFORMATION
WE
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
ORGANIZATIONS
HERE
WHICH
ARE
FOUNDED
BY
PEOPLE
OF
ONE
SPECIFIC
CHURCH
AND
WHOSE
MEMBERS
ARE
ALL
MEMBERS
OF
THAT
CHURCH
THIS
HAS
BEEN
CONSIDERED
AS
CORRECT
FOR
YEARS
ONLY
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
PEOPLE
STARTED
TO
DISCUSS
ABOUT
THIS
AND
NOW
WE
ARE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THIS
PROCESS
SOME
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
OPENING
THEIR
DOORS
FOR
PEOPLE
FROM
OTHER
CHURCHES
ETC
I
MUST
WARN
THAT
THIS
SOUNDS
CLIQUEY
TO
ME
A
CLIQUE
IS
A
GROUP
WHICH
RUNS
AROUND
TOGETHER
TO
SOME
EXTENT
EXCLUSIVELY
THIS
CAUSES
PROBLEMS
IN
FELLOWSHIP
AND
CAUSES
DIVISIONS
I
WOULD
NOT
SAY
AT
ALL
THAT
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
CORRECT
FOR
A
CHURCHGROUP
TO
DO
FOR
ANY
REASON
IN
ONE
OF
THE
CHURCHES
I
ATTENDED
FOR
EXAMPLE
THERE
WAS
AN
INTERNAL
CLIQUE
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
ON
THE
DIFFERENT
GROUPSCOMMITTEESORGANIZATIONAL
HEADS
OF
THE
CONGREGATION
THEY
RARELY
TALKED
TO
ANYONE
ELSE
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
COMMITTEES
AND
SELDOM
WERE
VOTED
OUT
OF
OFFICE
WITHOUT
ANOTHER
OFFICE
BEING
OPENED
UP
SO
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
STEP
RIGHT
BACK
IN
THEIR
DEGREE
OF
EXCLUSION
WAS
SUCH
THAT
WHEN
THE
NEW
PASTOR
CAME
HE
NEARLY
HAD
TO
WIPE
OUT
EVERYTHING
AND
START
FROM
SCRATCH
I
WISH
HE
WOULDVE
SINCE
THEY
STILL
HAVE
NO
CLUE
ABOUT
WHAT
IT
MEANS
TO
BE
A
DISCIPLE
ANYWAY
THIS
RIGIDITY
IN
THE
CLIQUE
IS
BEGINNING
TO
BE
BROKEN
DOWN
BUT
IS
STILL
THERE
SO
I
MUST
WARN
AGAINST
SUCH
DIVISION
WITHIN
THERES
ENOUGH
DIVISION
WITHOUT
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
OPINIONS
IN
ADVANCE
