REFERRING
TO
MARY
SHE
WAS
IMMACULATELY
CONCEIVED
AND
SO
NEVER
SUBJECT
TO
ORIGINAL
SIN
BUT
ALSO
NEVER
COMMITTED
A
PERSONAL
SIN
IN
HER
WHOLE
LIFE
THIS
WAS
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SPECIAL
DEGREE
OF
GRACE
GRANTED
TO
HER
BY
GOD
SKIPPING
I
DONT
PARTICULARLY
OBJECT
TO
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
ASSUMPTION
OR
THE
PERPETUAL
VIRGINITY
BOTH
OF
WHICH
I
REGARD
AS
CATHOLIC
DOGMA
ABOUT
WHICH
I
WILL
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
MY
CATHOLIC
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
IN
CHRIST
AND
I
EVEN
BELIEVE
IN
THE
VIRGIN
BIRTH
OF
JESUS
BUT
THIS
CONCEPT
OF
MARYS
SINLESSNESS
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
AT
ODDS
WITH
THE
REST
OF
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
HAS
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
VIEW
OF
MARY
THAN
DO
MOST
OTHER
CHRISTIAN
CHURCHES
THOSE
WITH
PARALLEL
BELIEFS
NOTWITHSTANDING
CHRIST
BY
MOST
ACCOUNTS
IS
THE
ONLY
SINLESS
PERSON
TO
EVER
LIVE
I
TOO
HAVE
TROUBLE
WITH
A
SINLESS
MARY
CONCEPT
JUST
AS
FOR
THE
RELATED
ISSUE
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
SIN
ONLY
ADAM
AND
EVE
WILL
ANSWER
FOR
THAT
ONE
MY
CHILDREN
DO
NOT
ANSWER
FOR
MY
SINS
CERTAINLY
I
ONLY
ANSWER
FOR
MINE
