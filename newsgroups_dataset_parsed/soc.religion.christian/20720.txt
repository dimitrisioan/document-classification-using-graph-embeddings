COULD
ANYONE
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
IVE
HEARD
IT
SAID
THAT
THE
ACCOUNTS
WE
HAVE
OF
CHRISTS
LIFE
AND
MINISTRY
IN
THE
GOSPELS
WERE
ACTUALLY
WRITTEN
MANY
YEARS
AFTER
THE
EVENT
ABOUT
YEARS
OR
SO
IS
THIS
CORRECT
IF
SO
WHY
THE
BIG
TIME
DELAY
I
KNOW
ALL
SCRIPTURE
IS
INSPIRED
OF
GOD
SO
THE
TIME
OF
WRITING
IS
I
SUPPOSE
UNIMPORTANT
BUT
I
STILL
CANT
HELP
BE
CURIOUS
IVAN
THOMAS
BARR
CONTACT
ME
AT
THE
GOSPELS
ARENT
DATED
SO
WE
CAN
ONLY
GUESS
LUKES
PROLOG
IS
ABOUT
THE
ONLY
THING
WE
HAVE
FROM
THE
AUTHOR
DESCRIBING
HIS
PROCESS
THE
PROLOG
SOUNDS
LIKE
LUKE
IS
FROM
THE
NEXT
GENERATION
AND
HAD
TO
DO
SOME
INVESTIGATING
THERE
ARE
TRADITIONS
PASSED
DOWN
VERBALLY
THAT
SAY
A
FEW
THINGS
ABOUT
THE
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
GOSPELS
THERE
ARE
DEBATES
ABOUT
HOW
RELIABLE
THESE
TRADITIONS
ARE
THEY
CERTAINLY
DONT
HAVE
THE
STATUS
OF
SCRIPTURE
YET
SCHOLARS
TEND
TO
TAKE
SOME
OF
THEM
SERIOUSLY
ONE
SUGGESTS
THAT
MARK
WAS
BASED
ON
PETERS
SERMONS
AND
WAS
WRITTEN
TO
PRESERVE
THEM
WHEN
PETER
HAD
DIED
OR
WAY
ABOUT
TO
DIE
ONE
TRADITION
ABOUT
MATTHEW
SUGGESTS
THAT
A
COLLECTION
OF
JESUS
WORDS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
EARLIER
THAN
THE
CURRENT
GOSPELS
IN
THE
ANCIENT
WORLD
IT
WAS
MUCH
MORE
COMMON
TO
RELY
ON
VERBAL
TRANSMISSION
OF
INFORMATION
I
THINK
MANY
PEOPLE
WOULD
HAVE
PREFERRED
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
JESUS
DIRECTLY
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
HAD
KNOWN
HIM
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
STUDIED
DIRECTLY
UNDER
SUCH
A
PERSON
RATHER
THAN
FROM
A
BOOK
THUS
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
GOSPELS
ARE
LARGELY
FROM
A
PERIOD
WHEN
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
BEGINNING
TO
DIE
SCHOLARS
GENERALLY
DO
THINK
THERE
WAS
SOME
WRITTEN
MATERIAL
EARLIER
WHICH
WAS
PROBABLY
USED
AS
SOURCES
FOR
THE
EXISTING
GOSPELS
ESTABLISHING
THE
DATES
IS
A
COMPLEX
AND
TECHNICAL
BUSINESS
I
HAVE
TO
CONFESS
THAT
IM
NOT
SURE
HOW
MUCH
RELIANCE
ID
PUT
ON
THE
METHODS
USED
BUT
ITS
COMMON
TO
THINK
THAT
MARK
WAS
WRITTEN
FIRST
AROUND
AD
AND
THAT
ALL
OF
THE
GOSPELS
WERE
WRITTEN
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
CENTURY
A
FEW
PEOPLE
VARY
THIS
BY
A
DECADE
OR
SO
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
CLH
