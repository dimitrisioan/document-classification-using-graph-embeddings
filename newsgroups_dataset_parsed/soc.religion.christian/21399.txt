DAVE
DAVIS
WRITES
LET
MY
STATE
MY
POINT
AS
PROVOCATIVELY
AS
POSSIBLE
AFTER
GOING
THROUGH
SEVERAL
STUDY
BIBLES
IM
LEANING
HEAVILY
TOWARDS
THE
ASSERTION
THAT
SIRACH
THE
WISDOM
OF
BEN
SIRA
OR
ECCLESIASTICUS
IS
DIRECTLY
REFERENCED
BY
JAMES
IN
FACT
I
THINK
SIRACH
IS
MORE
DIRECTLY
REFERENCED
BY
JAMES
THAN
JOB
OR
RUTH
IS
REFERENCED
IN
ANY
NT
VERSE
IVE
SEEN
GOOD
POINT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DOES
NOT
QUOTE
EZRA
NEHEMIAH
ESTHER
RUTH
JOB
ECCLESIASTES
OR
SONG
OF
SONGS
JUST
AS
IT
DOES
NOT
QUOTE
FROM
THE
DEUTEROCANON
BUT
IF
THE
NONQUOTATION
OF
THE
FORMER
DOES
NOT
DISQUALIFY
THEM
NEITHER
DOES
THE
NONQUOTATION
OF
THE
LATER
AND
THE
WISODM
OF
SOLOMON
WAS
QUITE
CLEARLY
AN
INFLUENCE
ON
ST
PAUL
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
LETTER
TO
THE
ROMANS
CF
ESPECIALLY
ROMANS
AND
WISDOM
STUFF
DELETED
I
THINK
EVERYONE
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
PRINCIPLES
THAT
CANNOT
BE
CONSISTENTLY
APPLIED
ARE
NOT
VERY
USEFUL
AS
PRINCIPLES
SO
IF
WE
ARE
TO
EXCLUDE
THEM
NOT
ACCORD
THEM
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
SCRIPTURE
WE
WOULD
APPEAR
TO
REQUIRE
OTHER
REASONS
WHAT
MIGHT
THESE
REASONS
BE
TRADITION
ALWAYS
A
FAV
WITH
EPISCOP
TRADITION
IS
EQUIVOCAL
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
SIRACH
I
BELIEVE
IS
IN
VATICANUS
SINAITICUS
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
IS
LISTED
IN
THE
MURATORIAN
CANON
THE
OLDEST
LIST
I
KNOW
OF
SIRACH
AND
THE
OTHERS
ARE
DISCUSSED
BY
THE
FATHERS
AS
SCRIPTURE
BUT
NOT
UNANIMOUSLY
TRUE
NOT
ALL
ACCEPTED
THEM
AS
SCRIPTURE
THOUGH
NIETHER
WERE
ALL
THE
BOOKS
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
SO
ACCEPTED
WHICH
PUTS
TO
THE
LIE
THE
WHOLE
ARGUMENT
OF
THE
BOOKS
BEING
EXCLUDED
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
DEBATED
AND
NOT
UNIVERSALLY
ACCEPTED
HEBREWS
THE
APOCALYPSE
PETER
ESTHER
AND
OTHERS
WERE
DEBATED
AT
VARIOUS
TIMES
BUT
EVENTUALLY
RETAINED
AS
FOR
THE
CODEXES
YOU
MENTION
BOTH
VATICANUS
AND
SINAITCUS
INCLUDE
THE
DEUTEROCANON
BOTHE
OF
THE
NEW
AND
OLD
TESTAMENTS
AND
VATICANUS
I
THINK
INLCUDES
CLEMENT
THE
SHEPARD
OF
HERMAS
AND
THE
EPISTLE
OF
BARANABAS
AS
FOR
THE
MURATORIAN
CANON
IT
DEALS
WITH
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
ONLY
THOUGH
IT
IS
VERY
VALUABLE
IN
ITS
WITNESS
TO
THOSE
BOOKS
MY
INTERIM
CONCLUSION
IS
THAT
PROTESTANT
EXCLUSION
OF
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THESE
WRITINGS
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
TRADITIONS
OF
MEN
ONE
HEARS
OF
SO
OFTEN
THEY
WERE
EXCLUDED
DURING
THE
REFORMATION
AND
THAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
REASON
MANY
PEOPLE
CONTINUE
TO
EXCLUDE
THEM
ANY
TAKERS
I
CAN
BE
REASONABLE
IF
ALL
ELSE
FAILS
SHOW
ME
WHERE
IM
WRONG
YOURE
NOT
WRONG
IT
IS
A
TRADITION
OF
MEN
TO
EXLCUDE
THEM
AS
I
WILL
EXPLAIN
BELOW
THAT
NOTHING
BE
READ
IN
THE
CHURCH
UNDER
THE
NMAE
OF
DIVINE
SCRIPTURE
EXCEPT
THE
CANONICAL

STATUTE
AD
THIS
SAME
LIST
WAS
PROMULGATED
AGAIN
AT
THE
THIRD
COUNCIL
OF
CARTHAGE
AD
AND
AT
THE
SIXTH
COUNCIL
OF
CARTHAGE
AD
AT
WHICH
COUNCIL
THE
SAME
LIST
WAS
ENUMERATED
WITH
THE
WORDS
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
RECIEVED
FROM
THE
FATHERS
THAT
THESE
ARE
THE
BOOKS
TO
BE
READ
IN
THE
CHURCH
WHICH
OUGHT
TO
QUIET
THOSE
WHO
ASSERT
IN
THE
NAME
OF
HOLY
SCRIPTURE
WE
DO
UNDERSTAND
THOSE
BOOKS
OF
WHOSE
AUTHORITY
THERE
WAS
NEVER
ANY
DOUBT
IN
THE
CHURCH
AS
THE
EPISCOPAL
CHURCH
DOES
IN
REMOVING
THE
DEUTEROCANON
FROM
THE
REALM
OF
SCRIPTURE
THOUGH
THE
EPISCOPALIANS
HOLD
THEM
IN
HIGH
REGARD
AND
READ
THEM
IN
THE
CHURCH
THEY
ARE
NOT
COUNTED
AS
SCRIPTURE
BY
THEM
AND
MAY
NOT
BE
USED
TO
PROVE
DOGMA
THE
LUTHERANS
HOLD
OUT
SIMILARLY
EARLIER
MENTION
OF
THE
SOCALLED
APOCRYPHA
AS
DIVINE
SCRIPTURE
CAN
ALSO
BE
FOUND
AND
BELOW
I
INLCUDE
ONLY
A
PORTION
OF
THE
QUOTES
CALLING
IT
DIVINE
SCRIPTURE
THAT
COULD
BE
FOUND
AMONG
THE
WRITINGS
OF
THE
FATHERS
AND
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
WHY
THE
LAW
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
IS
RECKONED
AS
CONSISTING
OF
TWENTYTWO
BOOKS
SO
THAT
THEY
MAY
CORRESPOND
TO
THE
NUMBER
OF
LETTERS
IN
THE
HEBREW
ALPHABET
IT
IS
TO
BE
NOTED
ALSO
THAT
BY
ADDING
TO
THESE
TOBIAS
AND
JUDITH
THERE
ARE
TWENTYFOUR

HISTORY
OF

DATING
FROM

AD
BOOK
IT
IS
LIKEWISE
DECREED
NOW
INDEED
WE
MUST
TREAT
OF
THE
DIVINE
SCRIPTURES
WHAT
THE
UNIVERSAL

ACCEPTS
AND
WHAT

MUST
SHUN

ST
DAMASUS
I
POPE
THE
DECREE
OF
DAMSUS
SECTION
AD
I
WOULD
THINK
THIS
ENOUGH
THOUGH
MORE
CAN
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THE
CHURCH
HAS
ALWAYS
ACCEPTED
THE
DEUTEROCANON
THOUGH
PARTS
HAVE
BEEN
DISPUTED
BY
VARIOUS
PERSONS
FOR
IF
DISPUTES
INVOLVING
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DEUTEROCANON
DOES
NOT
DISQULAIFY
THOSE
BOOKS
IE
HEBREWS
JAMES
PETER
JOHN
JUDE
REVELATION
IN
PROTESTANT
EYES
THAN
NEITHER
SHOULD
IT
DISQULAIFY
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
BOOKS
AND
I
MUST
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
JEWS
ONLY
DREW
UP
THEIR
CANON
IN
AD
YEARS
AFTER
THE
FOUNDING
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
RELIGION
UPON
THE
CROSS
WHY
SHOULD
WE
ADHERE
TO
A
CANON
THAT
WAS
DRAWN
UP
BY
THE
FAITHLESS
IN
REACTION
TO
THE
CHRSITIAN
USE
OF
THE
GREEK
SEPTUAGINT
WHICH
INCLUDES
THE
DEUTEROCANON
AS
EARLY
AS
AD
ST
JUSTIN
HAD
ALREADY
ACCUSED
THE
JEWS
OF
MUTILATING
THE
CANON
OF
SCRIPTURE
BY
THEIR
REMOVAL
OF
CERTAIN
BOOKS
PROTESTANTS
APPARENTLY
PREFER
TO
THINK
THAT
GODS
REVELATION
WAS
LIMITED
BY
A
DECREE
OF
THE
JEWS
IN
THE
ORDERING
OF
THEIR
THE
JEWS
FAITHLESS
CANON
AND
THAT
HE
COULD
NOT
USE
OTHER
PEOPLE
LIKE
THE
APOSTLES
IN
DRAWING
UP
THE
CANON
THE
APOSTLES
WERE
MOST
CERTAIN
USERS
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
AS
SOME
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
QUOTES
USE
THE
WORDING
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
AND
NOT
THE
HEBREW
AND
THE
SEPTUAGINT
INCLUDES
THE
DEUTEROCANON
