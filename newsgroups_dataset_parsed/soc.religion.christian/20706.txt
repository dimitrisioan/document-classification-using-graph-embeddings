ITERATIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
HI
IM
NOT
A
RELIGIOUS
GUY
SO
DONT
TAKE
THIS
AS
SOME
KINDA
FLAME
THANX
IN
ADVANCE
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHY
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
DIFFERENT
VERSIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
THERE
IS
THIS
VERSION
OF
THE
BIBLE
I
HAVE
READ
ABOUT
AND
ON
THE
FRONT
PAGE
IT
SAYS
CONTAINS
INACCURATE
DATA
AND
INCONSISTENCIES
THANX
IN
ADVANCE
SHAZ
IM
NOT
SURE
QUITE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
MANY
DIFFERENT
VERSIONS
THE
PRIMARY
DISTINCTION
IN
VERSIONS
YOU
SEE
TODAY
IS
IN
THE
STYLE
OF
THE
TRANSLATION
ITS
PRETTY
UNUSUAL
TO
SEE
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCES
IN
MEANING
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
DIFFERENCES
IN
THE
UNDERLYING
TEXT
THATS
BECAUSE
BEFORE
PRINTING
MANUSCRIPTS
WERE
COPIED
BY
HAND
SLIGHT
DIFFERENCES
RESULTED
THERE
ARE
ENOUGH
MANUSCRIPTS
AROUND
THAT
SCHOLARS
CAN
DO
A
PRETTY
GOOD
JOB
OF
RECREATING
THE
ORIGINAL
BUT
THERE
ARE
SOME
UNCERTAINTIES
FORTUNATELY
THEY
ARE
GENERALLY
AT
THE
LEVEL
OF
MINOR
DIFFERENCES
IN
WORDING
THERE
ARE
SOMETHING
LIKE
OR
PLACES
WHERE
WHOLE
SENTENCES
ARE
INVOLVED
BUT
WITH
RECENT
DISCOVERIES
OF
OLDER
MANUSCRIPTS
I
DONT
THINK
THERES
MUCH
UNCERTAINLY
ABOUT
THOSE
CASES
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
NO
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
PROCESS
OF
COPYING
MANUSCRIPTS
OR
THE
PROCESS
OF
TRANSLATING
IS
FREE
OF
ERROR
BUT
I
ALSO
DONT
THINK
THERES
ENOUGH
UNCERTAINTY
IN
ESTABLISHING
THE
TEXT
OR
TRANSLATING
IT
THAT
IT
HAS
MUCH
PRACTICAL
EFFECT
WHETHER
THE
BIBLE
CONTAINS
INACCURATE
DATA
AND
INCONSISTENCES
IS
A
HOT
TOPIC
OF
DEBATE
HERE
MANY
CHRISTIANS
DENY
IT
SOME
ACCEPT
IT
THOUGH
MOST
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THE
INACCURACIES
INVOLVED
ARE
ON
DETAILS
THAT
DONT
AFFECT
THE
FAITH
BUT
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THERE
BEING
MULTIPLE
VERSIONS
THE
SUPPOSED
INCONSISTENCES
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
ALL
THE
VERSIONS
IM
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
A
REFERENCE
TO
THIS
ON
THE
TITLE
PAGE
THOUGH
WHAT
VERSION
ARE
YOU
TALKING
ABOUT
IVE
BEEN
REFERRING
TO
MAJOR
SCHOLARLY
TRANSLATIONS
THESE
ARE
WHAT
GET
REFERENCED
IN
POSTINGS
HERE
AND
ELSEWHERE
THERE
HAVE
CERTAINLY
BEEN
EDITIONS
THAT
ARE
TO
BE
KIND
LESS
WIDELY
ACCEPTED
THIS
INCLUDES
EVERYTHING
FROM
RECONSTRUCTIONS
THAT
COMBINE
PARALLEL
ACCOUNTS
INTO
SINGLE
NARRATIONS
TO
EDITIONS
THAT
OMIT
MATERIAL
THAT
THE
EDITOR
OBJECTS
TO
FOR
SOME
REASON
OR
THE
OTHER
THE
COPYRIGHT
ON
THE
BIBLE
HAS
LONG
SINCE
EXPIRED
SO
THERE
NOTHING
TO
STOP
PEOPLE
FROM
MAKING
EDITIONS
THAT
DO
WHATEVER
WIERD
THING
THEY
WANT
HOWEVER
THE
EDITIONS
THAT
ARE
WIDELY
USED
ARE
CAREFULLY
PREPARED
BY
GROUPS
OF
SCHOLARS
FROM
A
VARIETY
OF
BACKGROUNDS
WITH
LOTS
OF
CROSSCHECKS
I
COULD
IMAGINE
ONE
OF
THE
LESSERKNOWN
EDITIONS
CLAIMING
TO
HAVE
FIXED
UP
ALL
INACCURATE
DATA
AND
INCONSISTENCIES
BUT
IF
SO
ITS
NOT
ANY
EDITION
THATS
WIDELY
USED
THE
WIDELY
USED
ONES
LEAVE
THE
TEXT
AS
IS
WEEEEELLLLLLL
ALMOST
AS
IS
ITS
BEEN
ALLEGED
THAT
A
FEW
TRANSLATIONS
HAVE
FUDGED
A
WORD
OR
TWO
HERE
AND
THERE
TO
MINIMIZE
INCONSISTENCIES
BECAUSE
TRANSLATION
IS
NOT
AN
EXACT
SCIENCE
THERE
ARE
ALWAYS
GOING
TO
BE
DIFFERENCES
IN
OPINION
OVER
WHICH
WORD
IS
BEST
IM
AFRAID
CLH
