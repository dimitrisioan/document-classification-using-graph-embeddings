I
CAN
ONLY
REPLY
WITH
WHAT
IT
SAYS
IN
TIMOTHY
IM
NOT
HERE
TO
DISCOUNT
PARTS
OF
THE
BIBLE
RATHER
IM
HERE
ONLY
TO
DISCOUNT
THE
NOTION
OF
REVELATION
THE
AUTHOR
OF
TIMOTHY
TOLD
WHAT
HE
THOUGHT
WAS
THE
TRUTH
BASED
ON
HIS
BELIEF
IN
GOD
HIS
FAITH
IN
JESUS
AS
THE
RESURRECTED
SON
AND
HIS
READINGS
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
BUT
AGAIN
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
REVEALED
TO
HIM
WAS
BASED
ON
AT
BEST
SECONDHAND
INFORMATION
GIVEN
BY
FRIENDS
AND
AUTHORS
WHO
MAY
NOT
HAVE
GIVEN
THE
WHOLE
TRUTH
OR
WHO
MAY
HAVE
EXAGGERATED
A
BIT
FIRST
OF
ALL
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
MISQUOTED
THE
REFERENCE
IS
FROM
TIM
THE
AUTHOR
WAS
PAUL
AND
HIS
REVELATIONS
WERE
ANYTHING
BUT
AT
BEST
SECONDHAND
AND
IS
CAME
ABOUT
THAT
AS
SAUL
JOURNEYED
HE
WAS
APPROACHING
DAMASCUS
AND
SUDDENLY
A
LIGHT
FROM
HEAVEN
FLASHED
AROUND
HIM
AND
HE
FELL
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
HEARD
A
VOICE
SAYING
TO
HIM
SAUL
SAUL
WHY
ARE
YOU
PERSECUTING
ME
AND
HE
SAID
WHO
ART
THOU
LORD
AND
HE
SAID
I
AM
JESUS
WHOM
YOU
ARE
PERSECUTING
ACTS
NAS
PAUL
RECEIVED
REVELATION
DIRECTLY
FROM
THE
RISEN
JESUS
PRETTY
COOL
EH
HE
BECAME
CLOSELY
INVOLVED
WITH
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
THE
LEADERS
OF
WHICH
WERE
FOLLOWERS
OF
JESUS
THROUGHOUT
HIS
MINISTRY
ON
EARTH
NOW
YOU
MAY
SAY
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
REVEALED
THESE
THINGS
UNTO
HIM
AND
WE
COULD
GO
INTO
THAT
ARGUMENT
BUT
YOUD
BE
HARDPRESSED
TO
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
EXISTS
I
AGREE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ANYONE
BUT
THE
SPIRIT
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
CONVINCE
YOU
THE
SPIRIT
EXISTS
PLEASE
DONT
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
THIS
BEING
CIRCULAR
I
KNOW
IT
IS
BUT
REALLY
CAN
ANYTHING
OF
THE
NATURAL
WORLD
EXPLAIN
THE
SUPERNATURAL
THIS
IS
WHY
REVELATION
IS
NECESSARY
TO
THE
AUTHORS
OF
THE
BIBLE
ADDITIONALLY
WHAT
HE
HAS
WRITTEN
IS
AGAIN
SECONDHAND
INFO
IF
IT
WERE
GIVEN
BY
THE
SPIRIT
AND
STILL
CARRIES
THE
CHANCE
IT
IS
NOT
TRUE
THE
SPIRIT
IS
PART
OF
GOD
HOW
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
THE
SOURCE
CAN
YOU
GET
THE
GREEK
IN
TIMOTHY
WHICH
IS
SOMETIMES
TRANSLATED
AS
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
LITERALLY
MEANS
GODBREATHED
IN
OTHER
WORDS
GOD
SPOKE
THE
ACTUAL
WORDS
INTO
THE
SCRIPTURES
MANY
THEOLOGIANS
AND
BIBLE
SCHOLARS
DR
JAMES
BOICE
IS
ONE
THAT
I
CAN
REMEMBER
OFFHAND
GET
QUITE
ANNOYED
BY
THE
DRYNESS
AND
INCOMPLETENESS
OF
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
THE
ONLY
WAY
YOU
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
ESCAPE
THIS
NOTION
OF
SECONDHAND
INFO
IS
TO
HAVE
HAD
THE
ENTIRE
BIBLE
WRITTEN
BY
GOD
HIMSELF
AND
TO
TELL
THE
TRUTH
IVE
STUDIED
THE
BIBLE
EXTENSIVELY
AND
HAVE
YET
TO
HEAR
OF
SCHOLARS
WHO
HAVE
PUT
FORTH
OBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
SHOWING
GOD
AS
THE
FIRST
AUTHOR
OF
THIS
COLLECTION
OF
BOOKS
THATS
WHAT
THE
VERSE
TAKEN
FROM
TIMOTHY
WAS
ALL
ABOUT
THE
CONTINUITY
OF
A
BOOK
WRITTEN
OVER
A
SPAN
OF
YEARS
BY
MORE
THAN
AUTHORS
FROM
ALL
WALKS
OF
LIFE
IS
A
TESTIMONY
TO
THE
SINGLE
AUTHORSHIP
OF
GOD
AND
AS
FOR
REASON
READ
WHAT
IT
SAYS
IN
CORINTHIANS
ABOUT
HUMAN
WISDOM
BASICALLY
IT
SAYS
THAT
HUMAN
WISDOM
IS
USELESS
WHEN
COMPARED
WITH
WHAT
GOD
HAS
WRITTEN
FOR
OUR
LEARNING
IF
YOU
KNEW
OF
JESUS
AS
WELL
AS
YOU
KNOW
THE
BIBLE
YOUD
REALIZE
HE
REASONED
OUT
THE
LAW
AND
THE
PROPHETS
FOR
THE
COMMON
MAN
WHAT
SOURCE
TO
YOU
CLAIM
TO
HAVE
DISCOVERED
WHICH
HAS
INFORMATION
OF
SUPERIOR
HISTORICITY
TO
THE
BIBLE
CERTAINLY
NOT
JOSEPHUS
WRITINGS
OR
THE
WRITINGS
OF
THE
GNOSTICS
WHICH
WERE
THIRD
CENTURY
AT
THE
EARLIEST
AND
THOUGH
SOME
CLAIM
JESUS
WAS
HE
WAS
HUMAN
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
HUMAN
WISDOM
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
SET
OUT
TO
CRITICIZE
YET
WOULD
YOU
NOT
EMBRACE
THE
IDEA
THAT
JESUS
WAS
WISE
JESUS
WAS
FULLY
GOD
AS
WELL
THATS
WHY
ID
ASSERT
THAT
HE
IS
WISE
I
REALISE
THAT
YOU
MAY
NOT
ACCEPT
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
BIBLE
THIS
IS
UNFORTUNATE
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
OF
LEARNING
ABOUT
GOD
AND
CHRIST
AND
GODS
PURPOSE
WITH
THE
EARTH
THAN
READING
THE
BIBLE
AND
SEARCHING
OUT
ITS
TRUTH
FOR
YOURSELF
FOR
YOUR
INFORMATION
I
WAS
RAISED
WITHOUT
ANY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
GOD
BY
THE
TIME
SOME
OF
THE
FAITHFUL
CAME
TO
SHOW
ME
THE
WORD
AND
SHARE
WITH
ME
ITS
TRUTH
I
WAS
LIVING
HAPPILY
AND
MORALLY
WITHOUT
ACKNOWLEDGING
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
SUPREME
BEING
I
HAVE
THOUGH
READ
THE
BIBLE
SEVERAL
TIMES
OVER
IN
ITS
ENTIRETY
AND
HAVE
STUDIED
IT
THOROUGHLY
IT
CONTAINS
TRUTH
IN
IT
AND
I
CONSIDER
JESUS
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
MORAL
OF
HUMAN
BEINGS
TO
HAVE
LIVED
IN
FACT
I
DARNNEAR
IDOLIZE
THE
GUY
BUT
THERES
NO
RATIONAL
REASON
FOR
ME
TO
EXCEPT
GODS
EXISTENCE
PLEASE
RETHINK
THIS
LAST
PARAGRAPH
IF
THERE
IS
NO
GOD
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
YOUR
CURRENT
BELIEF
THEN
JESUS
WAS
EITHER
A
LIAR
OR
A
COMPLETE
NUT
BECAUSE
NOT
ONLY
DID
HE
ASSERT
THAT
GOD
EXISTS
BUT
HE
CLAIMED
TO
BE
GOD
HIMSELF
REGARDS
TO
CS
LEWIS
HOW
THEN
COULD
YOU
HAVE
THE
LEAST
BIT
OF
RESPECT
FOR
JESUS
IN
CONCLUSION
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
LOGICALLY
UNFOUNDED
HYPOTHESES
BASED
ON
GUT
FEELINGS
ABOUT
THE
TEXT
AND
OTHER
SCHOLARS
UNSUBSTANTIATED
CLAIMS
THE
BIBLE
PLEADS
THAT
WE
TAKE
IT
IN
ITS
ENTIRETY
OR
THROW
THE
WHOLE
BOOK
OUT
ABOUT
YOUR
READING
OF
THE
BIBLE
NOT
ONLY
DOES
THE
SPIRIT
INSPIRE
THE
WRITERS
BUT
HE
GUIDES
THE
READER
AS
WELL
WE
CANNOT
UNDERSTAND
IT
IN
THE
LEAST
WITHOUT
THE
SPIRITS
GUIDANCE
FOR
TO
US
GOD
REVEALED
THEM
THROUGH
THE
SPIRIT
FOR
THE
SPIRIT
SEARCHES
ALL
THINGS
EVEN
THE
