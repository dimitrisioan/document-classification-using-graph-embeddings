PAULS
THORN
IN
THE
SIDE
JOE
MOORE
WRITES
PAUL
REPEATEDLY
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
THORN
IN
HIS
SIDE
SOME
THINK
IT
REFERS
TO
LUST
OTHERS
PRIDE
BUT
WHO
KNOWS
WHATEVER
THE
THORN
WAS
APPARENTLY
IT
WAS
NOT
COMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
YET
DOES
THAT
MAKE
HIS
EPISTLES
ANY
LESS
PAUL
MENTIONS
HIS
THORN
SKOLOPS
ACTUALLY
A
SHARP
STAKE
IN
CORINTHIANS
AND
TO
KEEP
ME
FROM
BEING
TOO
ELATED
BY
THE
ABUNDANCE
OF
REVELATIONS
A
THORN
WAS
GIVEN
ME
IN
THE
FLESH
A
MESSENGER
OF
SATAN
TO
HARASS
ME
TO
KEEP
ME
FROM
BEING
TOO
ELATED
THREE
TIMES
I
BESOUGHT
THE
LORD
ABOUT
THIS
THAT
IT
SHOULD
LEAVE
ME
BUT
HE
SAID
TO
ME
MY
GRACE
IS
SUFFICIENT
FOR
YOU
FOR
MY
POWER
IS
MADE
PERFECTR
IN
WEAKNESS
HE
DOES
NOT
EXPLAIN
WHAT
IT
WAS
BUT
IT
NEED
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
A
MORAL
PROBLEM
ONE
GUESS
IS
THAT
PAUL
HAD
A
DISORDER
OF
THE
EYES
HE
ORDINARILY
DICTATED
HIS
LETTERS
AND
THEN
ADDED
A
PERSONAL
NOTE
AND
HIS
SIGNATURE
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
LETTER
TO
THE
GALATIANS
HE
SAYS
SEE
I
AM
WRITING
IN
LARGE
LETTERS
WITH
MY
OWN
HAND
OR
ELSE
SEE
WHAT
A
LONG
LETTER
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
WITH
MY
OWN
HAND
IF
THE
FORMER
TRANSLATION
IS
ADOPTED
IT
SEEMS
THAT
PAUL
COULD
NOT
WRITE
IN
THE
SMALL
SCRIPT
OF
A
PRACTICED
WRITER
BUT
NEEDED
TO
MAKE
HIS
LETTERS
LARGER
AND
THIS
SUGGESTS
EYE
PROBLEMS
AGAIN
HE
SAYS
TO
THE
GALATIANS
YOU
KNOW
THAT
IT
WAS
BECAUSE
OF
A
BODILY
AILMENT
THAT
I
PREACHED
THE
GOSPEL
TO
YOU
AT
FIRST
AND
ALTHOUGH
MY
CONDITION
WAS
A
TRIAL
TO
YOU
YOU
DID
NOT
SCORN
OR
DESPISE
ME
BUT
RECEIVED
ME
AS
AN
ANGEL
OF
GOD
FOR
I
BEAR
YOU
WITNESS
THAT
IF
POSSIBLE
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
PLUCKED
OUT
YOUR
EYES
AND
GIVEN
THEM
TO
ME
PERHAPS
THIS
LAST
LINE
MEANS
SIMPLY
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
ANYTHING
FOR
ME
NOT
WITHHOLDING
YOUR
MOST
PRECIOUS
POSSESSIONS
YOUR
EYES
BUT
IN
THAT
CASE
WE
WOULD
EXPECT
SOME
WORDING
LIKE
IF
I
HAD
NEEDED
THEM
IF
IT
WERE
POSSIBLE
SOUNDS
AS
THOUGH
THE
BODILY
AILMENT
WAS
CONNECTED
WITH
HIS
EYES
WILLIAM
BARCLAY
IN
HIS
VOLUME
ON
ACTS
MAKES
A
MORE
SPECIFIC
SUGGESTION
BEFORE
PAUL
PREACHED
IN
THE
HIGHLANDS
OF
GALATIA
HE
HAD
BEEN
PREACHING
IN
THE
COASTAL
AREAS
OF
ASIA
MINOR
IF
HE
HAD
HAD
A
MALARIAL
ATTACK
WHILE
THERE
A
DOCTOR
WOULD
HAVE
ADVISED
HIM
TO
LEAVE
THE
LOW
COUNTRY
AND
HEAD
FOR
THE
HILLS
MALARIA
MIGHT
WELL
HAVE
GIVEN
HIM
BOTH
SEVERE
HEADACHES
AND
BLURRED
VISION
YOURS

KIEFER
