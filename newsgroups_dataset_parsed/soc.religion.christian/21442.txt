RE
SERBIAN
GENOCIDE
WORK
OF
GOD
IN
ARTICLE
D
ANDREW
BYLER
WRITES
DOES
HE
BELIEVE
IN
PREDESTINATION
OF
COURSE
I
BELIEVE
IN
PREDESTINATION
ITS
A
VERY
BIBLICAL
DOCTRINE
AS
ROMANS
SHOWS
AMONG
OTHER
PASSAGES
FURTHERMORE
THE
CHURCH
HAS
ALWAYS
TAUGHT
PREDESTINATION
FROM
THE
VERY
BEGINNING
REALLY
YOU
MAY
BE
RIGHT
BUT
ID
LIKE
PROOF
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
AND
I
AM
NOT
A
DIV
SCHOOL
STUDENT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
ACCEPT
PREDESTINATION
MY
CHAPLAIN
TOLD
ME
BEWARE
OF
GREEKS
BEARING
GIFTS
WITH
REFERENCE
TO
THIS
DOCTRINE
IT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
THE
CURIOUS
RESULT
THAT
HUMAN
BEINGS
ARE
NOT
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
OWN
ACTIONS
ILL
ANSWER
HOW
YOU
DEAL
WITH
THIS
IN
A
MINUTE
BUT
TO
SAY
THAT
I
BELIEVE
IN
PREDESTINATION
DOES
NOT
MEAN
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
FREE
WILL
MEN
FREELY
CHOOSE
THE
COURSE
OF
THEIR
LIFE
WHICH
IS
ALSO
AFFECTED
BY
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
HOWEVER
UNLIKE
THE
CALVINISTS
AND
JANSENISTS
I
HOLD
THAT
GRACE
IS
RESISTABLE
OTHERWISE
YOU
END
UP
WITH
THE
IDIOCY
OF
DENYING
THE
UNIVERSAL
SAVING
WILL
OF
GOD
TIMOTHY
RIGHT
THAT
DOESNT
REALLY
SEEM
LIKE
PREDESTINATION
TO
ME
BUT
ILL
CONTINUE
WITH
WHAT
YOURE
SAYING
FOR
GOD
MUST
GIVE
ENOUGH
GRACE
TO
ALL
TO
BE
SAVED
BUT
ONLY
THE
ELECT
WHO
HE
FOREKNEW
ARE
PREDESTINED
AND
RECEIVE
THE
GRACE
OF
FINAL
PERSERVERANCE
WHICH
GUARANTEES
HEAVEN
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THOSE
WITHOUT
THAT
GRACE
CANT
BE
SAVED
IT
JUST
MEANS
THAT
GOD
FOREKNEW
THEIR
OBSTINACY
AND
CHOSE
NOT
TO
GIVE
IT
TO
THEM
KNOWING
THEY
WOULD
NOT
NEED
IT
AS
THEY
HAD
FREELY
CHOSEN
HELL
THIS
IS
REALLY
CONFUSING
TO
ME
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
I
STILL
BELIEVE
THAT
CHRIST
JESUS
DIED
FOR
ALL
OF
US
PREKNOWLEDGE
OF
OBSTINACY
SEEMS
LIKE
AN
AWFULLY
CONVOLUTED
WAY
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
VERSES
BUT
THEN
I
AM
NOT
REALLY
BIBLICALLY
SUPPORTED
IN
THIS
OPINION
OR
AM
I
OTHERS
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
SAVED
ARE
SAVED
BY
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
AND
NOT
BY
THEIR
OWN
EFFORT
FOR
IT
WAS
GOD
WHO
DISPOSED
THEM
TO
HIMSELF
AND
PREDESTINED
THEM
TO
BECOME
SAINTS
BUT
THOSE
WHO
PERISH
IN
EVERLASTING
FIRE
PERISH
BECAUSE
THEY
HARDENED
THEIR
HEART
AND
CHOSE
TO
PERISH
THUS
THEY
WERE
DESERVING
OF
GODS
PUNISHMENT
AS
THEY
HAD
REJECTED
THEIR
CREATOR
AND
SINNED
AGAINST
THE
WORKING
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
SO
GOD
USES
GRACE
LIKE
MARGARINE
HE
ONLY
SPREADS
IT
WHERE
ITS
NEEDED
AND
NOT
WHERE
IT
ISNT
AND
SO
THERE
ARE
THE
SAVED
AND
THE
NOTSAVED
AND
NOTHING
IN
BETWEEN
HMMMM
YES
IT
IS
UP
TO
GOD
TO
JUDGE
BUT
HE
WILL
ONLY
METE
OUT
THAT
PUNISHMENT
AT
THE
LAST
JUDGEMENT
WELL
I
WOULD
HOLD
THAT
AS
GOD
MOST
CERTAINLY
GIVES
EVERYBODY
SOME
BLESSING
FOR
WHAT
GOOD
THEY
HAVE
DONE
EVEN
IF
IT
WAS
ONLY
A
LITTLE
FOR
THOSE
HE
CANT
BLESS
IN
THE
NEXT
LIFE
HE
BLESSES
IN
THIS
ONE
ALTHOUGH
I
REALIZE
THIS
DOCTRINE
WAS
NOT
ORIGINALLY
INTENDED
TO
CAUSE
SOCIAL
PROBLEMS
IT
ENDS
UP
DOING
JUST
THAT
IF
THERE
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
SOME
SORT
OF
SIGN
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
ELECT
LIKE
LOTS
OF
CHILDREN
OR
SUCCESS
AT
WORK
THEN
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
A
GOOD
LIFE
ON
EARTH
WILL
GO
AROUND
THINKING
THAT
THOSE
WHO
DONT
ARE
DOOMED
TO
HELL
IN
A
WAY
THOUGH
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
THE
OPPOSITE
IDEA
THOSE
DOOMED
TO
HELL
WILL
HAVE
A
GREAT
LIFE
ON
EARTH
THATS
ALMOST
LIKE
THE
CONVERSE
OF
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
WHAT
WE
DO
NOW
WILL
BE
PUNISHED
AFTER
WE
DIE
YOURE
SAYING
WHAT
WE
GET
AFTER
WE
DIE
HAS
A
DIRECT
BEARING
ON
HOW
WE
LIVE
NOW
STRANGE
AND
THOSE
HE
WILL
NOT
PUNISH
IN
THE
NEXT
LIFE
WILL
BE
CHASTISED
IN
THIS
ONE
OR
IN
PURGATORY
FOR
THEIR
SINS
EVERY
SIN
INCURS
SOME
TEMPORAL
PUNISHMENT
THUS
GOD
WILL
PUNISH
IT
UNLESS
SATISFACTION
IS
MADE
FOR
IT
CF
SAMUEL
DAVIDS
SIN
OF
ADULTERY
AND
MURDER
WERE
FORGIVEN
BUT
HE
WAS
STILL
PUNISHED
WITH
THE
DEATH
OF
HIS
CHILD
AND
I
NEED
NOT
POINT
OUT
THE
IDEA
OF
PUNISHMENT
BECAUSE
OF
GODS
JUDGEMENT
IS
QUITE
PREVELANT
IN
THE
BIBLE
SODOM
AND
GOMMORRAH
MOSES
BARRED
FROM
THE
HOLY
LAND
THE
SLAUGHTER
OF
THE
CANNANITES
ANNIAS
AND
SAPHIRA
JERUSALEM
IN
AD
ETC
SO
SIN
IS
EITHER
PUNISHED
NOW
OR
LATER
AND
NOT
BOTH
WHAT
IF
ITS
SORT
OF
HALFPUNISHED
ARE
THERE
ANY
GREY
AREAS
IN
THIS
DOCTRINE
MY
STUFF
DELETED
WE
SHOULD
STOP
THE
SLAUGHTER
OF
THE
INNOCENT
CF
PROVERBS
BUT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
SUPPORT
A
WAR
IN
BOSNIA
WITH
THE
US
OR
EVEN
THE
UN
INVOLVED
I
DO
NOT
THINK
SO
BUT
I
AM
AN
ISOLATIONIST
AND
DISAGREE
WITH
FOREIGN
ADVENTURES
IN
GENERAL
BUT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
BOSNIA
I
FRANKLY
SEE
NO
EXCUSE
FOR
US
GETTING
MILITARILY
INVOLVED
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
A
JUST
WAR
BLESSED
AFTER
ALL
ARE
THE
PEACEMAKERS
WAS
WHAT
OUR
LORD
SAID
NOT
THE
INTERVENTIONISTS
OUR
ACTIONS
IN
BOSNIA
MUST
BE
FOR
PEACE
AND
NOT
FOR
A
WAR
WHICH
IS
UNRELATED
TO
ANYTHING
TO
JUSTIFY
IT
FOR
US
THE
IDEA
WELL
MY
IDEA
WOULD
BE
THAT
YOU
WOULD
INTERVENE
TO
ESTABLISH
PEACE
AND
STOP
THE
ATROCITIES
IM
NOT
SUGGESTING
WWIII
I
DONT
REALLY
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
A
JUST
WAR
OF
COURSE
I
AM
NOT
AN
ISOLATIONIST
ALTHOUGH
I
SEE
SOME
MERIT
IN
NOT
JUMPING
IN
AT
THE
FIRST
OPPORTUNITY
CAN
YOU
SAY
KUWAIT
WE
HAPPEN
TO
BE
A
BIG
COUNTRY
WITH
A
LOT
OF
RESOURCES
AS
WELL
AS
A
LOT
OF
DEBT
AND
THIS
GIVES
US
SOME
RESPONSIBILITY
IN
THE
WORLD
WHETHER
WE
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
FLASHBACKS
OF
WWII
AS
WELL
AS
VIETNAM
SHOULD
BE
HAUNTING
US
YET
ANOTHER
DIFFERENCE
OF
OPINION
SO
BE
IT
