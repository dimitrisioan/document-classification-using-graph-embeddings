HOMOSEXUAL
ISSUES

CHRISTIANITY

MICHAEL
SIEMON
WRITES
I
NOTICE
THAT
THE
VERSE
FORBIDDING
BESTIALITY
IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWS
THE
VERSE
PROHIBITING
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
IT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
IRRELEVANT
AND
INCOMPARABLE
TO
THE
ISSUES
GAY
CHRISTIANS
DO
RAISE
WHICH
CONCERN
SEXUAL
ACTIVITY
WITHIN
COMMITTED
CONSENSUAL
HUMAN
ADULT
REALTIONSHIPS
SO
THAT
YOUR
BRINGING
IT
UP
IS
NO
MORE
RELEVANT
THAN
THE
LAWS
OF
KASHRUT
IF
YOU
CANNOT
ADDRESS
THE
ACTUAL
ISSUES
YOU
ARE
BEING
BLOODY
DISHONEST
IN
TRAILING
THIS
RED
HERRING
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
WORLD
NO
IT
IS
VERY
RELEVANT
HOMOSEXUAL
ACTS
AND
ACTS
OF
BEASTIALITY
ARE
TOPICALLY
ARANGED
TOGETHER
IN
THE
LAW
THIS
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
ANYONE
WHO
WOULD
WANT
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
COMMAND
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALITY
DEALS
WITH
TEMPLE
PROSTITUTION
AND
I
THINK
YOU
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
PROOF
FOR
THIS
IF
THE
LAW
REVEALS
THE
CHARACTER
OF
GOD
AND
IS
HOLY
JUST
AND
GOOD
AS
IS
WRITTEN
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
THEN
THOSE
WHO
CONSIDER
WE
WHO
ARE
AGAINST
COMMITING
HOMOSEXUALS
ACTS
TO
BE
BIGGOTS
HAVE
TO
ADDRESS
THIS
PASSAGE
OF
SCRIPTURE
WHY
MUST
WE
ONLY
DISCUSS
SCRIPTURES
THAT
INVOLVE
CONSENSUAL
HUMAN
ADULT
RELATIONSHIPS
ISNT
THAT
BORDERING
ON
SOPHISTRY
THE
POINT
WE
ARE
MAKING
IS
THAT
GOD
DID
NOT
ORDAIN
CERTAIN
KINDS
OF
SEX
ACTS
NOT
EVERYONE
WHO
BRINGS
UP
THESE
SCRIPTURES
IS
JUST
TRYING
TO
USE
AND
EMOTIONAL
ARGUMENT
THAT
COMPARES
HOMOSEXUALS
TO
BEASTOPHILES
AND
CHILD
MOLESTORS
THE
ISSUE
WE
ARE
DEALING
WITH
IS
THAT
SOME
SEX
ACTS
ARE
UNGODLY
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
PROBLEM
WITH
A
LOVING
NONLUSTFUL
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
SAME
SEX
I
HAVE
THEM
AND
WE
ALL
DO
THE
ISSUE
AT
HAND
IS
THE
SINFULNESS
HAVING
SEX
WITH
MEMBERS
OF
THE
SAME
SEX
OR
LUSTING
AFTER
SO
OTHER
FORBIDDEN
SEX
ACTS
ARE
A
VALID
TOPIC
FOR
CONVERSATION
AND
THE
IDEA
THAT
THESE
RELATIONSHIPS
MAY
BE
EMOTIONAL
RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN
ADULT
HUMANS
IS
RED
HERRING
WE
ALL
AGREE
THAT
IT
IS
OKAY
FOR
ADULTS
TO
HAVE
CARING
RELATIONSHIPS
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
