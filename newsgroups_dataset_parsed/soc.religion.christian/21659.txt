continuing

article
survey
of
new
interpretations
of
arsenokoitai
ds
bailey
ds
bailey
was
perhaps
the
trailblazer
of
new
assessments
of
the
meaning
of
arsenokoitai
he
takes
the
term
in
i
cor
as
denoting
males
who
actively
engage
in
homosexual
acts
in
contrast
to
malakoi
effeminate
those
who
engage
passively
in
such
however
he
insists
that
paul
knew
nothing
of
inversion
as
an
inherited
trait
or
an
inherent
condition
due
to
psychological
or
glandular
causes
and
consequently
regards
all
homosexual
practice
as
evidence
of
perversion
hence
bailey
limits
the
terms
reference
in
pauls
works
to
acts
alone
and
laments
modern
translations
of
the
term
as
homosexuals
bailey
wants
to
distinguish
between
the
homosexual
condition
which
is
morally
neutral
and
homosexual
practices
italics
in
source
paul
is
precise
in
his
terminology
and
moffatts
translation
sodomites
best
represents
pauls
meaning
in
baileys
judgment
bailey
clearly
denies
that
the
homosexual
condition
was
known
by
biblical
writers
j
boswell
the
most
influential
study
of
arsenokoitai
among
contemporary
authors
is
that
of
john
whereas
the
usual
of
this
term
gives
it
either
explicitly
or
implicitly
an
active
sense
boswell
gives
it
a
passive
sense
in
an
extended
discussion
of
the
term
he
cites
linguistic
evidence
and
common
sense
to
support
his
conclusion
that
the
word
means
male
sexual
agents
ie
active
male
prostitutes
his
argument
is
that
the
arseno
part
of
the
word
is
adjectival
not
the
object
of
the
koitai
which
refers
to
base
sexual
activity
hence
the
term
according
to
boswell
designates
a
male
sexual
person
or
male
prostitute
he
acknowledges
however
that
most
interpret
the
composite
term
as
active
meaning
those
who
sleep
with
make
their
bed
with
men
boswell
bases
his
interpretation
on
linguistics
and
the
historical
setting
he
argues
that
in
some
compounds
such
as
paidomathes
child
learner
the
paido
is
the
subject
of
manthano
and
in
others
such
as
paidoporos
through
which
a
child
passes
the
paido
is
neither
subject
nor
object
but
simply
a
modifier
without
verbal
significance
his
point
is
that
each
compound
must
be
individually
analyzed
for
its
meaning
more
directly
he
maintains
that
compounds
with
the
attic
form
arreno
employ
it
objectively
while
those
with
the
hellenistic
arseno
use
it
as
an
adjective
yet
he
admits
exceptions
to
this
distinction
regarding
arreno
boswell
next
appeals
to
the
latin
of
the
time
namely
drauci
or
exoleti
these
were
male
prostitutes
having
men
or
women
as
their
objects
the
greek
arsenokoitai
is
the
equivalent
of
the
latin
drauci
the
corresponding
passive
would
be
parakoitai
one
who
lies
beside
boswell
affirms
he
claims
that
arsenokoitai
was
the
most
explicit
word
available
to
paul
for
a
male
prostitute
since
by
pauls
time
the
attic
words
pornos
fornicator
and
porneuon
one
committing
fornication
found
also
in
the
lxx
had
been
adopted
to
refer
to
men
who
resorted
to
female
prostitutes
or
simply
committed
in
the
absence
of
the
term
from
pagan
writers
such
as
herodotus
plato
aristotle
and
plutarch
and
from
the
jewish
writers
philo
and
josephus
boswell
finds
even
more
convincing
evidence
for
his
affirmation
that
arsenokoitai
did
not
connote
homosexual
or
even
sodomite
in
the
time
of
paul
he
also
demonstrates
its
absence
in
pseudolucian
sextus
empiricus
and
libanius
he
subsequently
finds
it
lacking
in
all
discussions
of
homosexual
relation
among
christian
sources
in
greek
including
the
didache
tatian
justin
martyr
clement
of
alexandria
gregory
of
nyssa
and
john
chrysostom
chrysostom
is
singled
out
for
his
omission
as
final
proof
that
the
word
could
not
mean
boswell
next
appeals
to
the
omission
of
the
texts
of
i
cor
and
i
tim
from
discussions
of
homosexuality
among
latin
church
fathers
cited
are
tertullian
arnobius
lactantius
and
augustine
the
last
named
uses
circumlocutions
other
latin
writers
include
ausonius
cyprian
and
minucius
felix
the
term
is
also
lacking
in
state
and
in
church
legislation
by
the
sixth
century
the
term
became
confused
and
was
applied
to
a
variety
of
sexual
activities
from
child
molesting
to
anal
intercourse
between
a
husband
and
wife
having
surveyed
the
sources
boswell
concludes
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
either
arsenokoitai
or
malakoi
connoted
homosexuality
in
the
time
of
paul
or
for
centuries
thereafter
and
every
reason
to
suppose
that
whatever
they
came
to
mean
they
were
not
determinative
of
christian
opinion
on
the
morality
of
homosexual
acts
it
is
clear
throughout
that
boswell
defines
arsenokoitai
to
refer
to
male
prostitutes
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
conclude
that
paul
would
probably
not
disapprove
of
gay
inclination
gay
relationships
enduring
love
between
persons
of
the
same
gender
