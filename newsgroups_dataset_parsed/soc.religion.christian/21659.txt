BAILEY
CLEARLY

THE

CONDITION
WAS
KNOWN
BY

WRITERS
J
BOSWELL
THE
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
STUDY
OF
ARSENOKOITAI
AMONG
CONTEMPORARY
AUTHORS
IS
THAT
OF
JOHN
WHEREAS
THE
USUAL
OF
THIS
TERM
GIVES
IT
EITHER
EXPLICITLY
OR
IMPLICITLY
AN
ACTIVE
SENSE
BOSWELL
GIVES
IT
A
PASSIVE
SENSE
IN
AN
EXTENDED
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
TERM
HE
CITES
LINGUISTIC
EVIDENCE
AND
COMMON
SENSE
TO
SUPPORT
HIS
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
WORD
MEANS
MALE
SEXUAL
AGENTS
IE
ACTIVE
MALE
PROSTITUTES
HIS
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
THE
ARSENO
PART
OF
THE
WORD
IS
ADJECTIVAL
NOT
THE
OBJECT
OF
THE
KOITAI
WHICH
REFERS
TO
BASE
SEXUAL
ACTIVITY
HENCE
THE
TERM
ACCORDING
TO
BOSWELL
DESIGNATES
A
MALE
SEXUAL
PERSON
OR
MALE
PROSTITUTE
HE
ACKNOWLEDGES
HOWEVER
THAT
MOST
INTERPRET
THE
COMPOSITE
TERM
AS
ACTIVE
MEANING
THOSE
WHO
SLEEP
WITH
MAKE
THEIR
BED
WITH

BOSWELL
BASES
HIS
INTERPRETATION
ON
LINGUISTICS
AND
THE
HISTORICAL
SETTING
HE
ARGUES
THAT
IN
SOME
COMPOUNDS
SUCH
AS
PAIDOMATHES
CHILD
LEARNER
THE
PAIDO
IS
THE
SUBJECT
OF
MANTHANO
AND
IN
OTHERS
SUCH
AS
PAIDOPOROS
THROUGH
WHICH
A
CHILD
PASSES
THE
PAIDO
IS
NEITHER
SUBJECT
NOR
OBJECT
BUT
SIMPLY
A
MODIFIER
WITHOUT
VERBAL
SIGNIFICANCE
HIS
POINT
IS
THAT
EACH
COMPOUND
MUST
BE
INDIVIDUALLY
ANALYZED
FOR
ITS
MEANING
MORE
DIRECTLY
HE
MAINTAINS
THAT
COMPOUNDS
WITH
THE
ATTIC
FORM
ARRENO
EMPLOY
IT
OBJECTIVELY
WHILE
THOSE
WITH
THE
HELLENISTIC
ARSENO
USE
IT
AS
AN
ADJECTIVE
