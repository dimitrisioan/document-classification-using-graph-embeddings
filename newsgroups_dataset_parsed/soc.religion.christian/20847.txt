POSTED
AS
A
GENERAL

STUDY
OF
THIS
DOCTRINE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
GOD
I
THE
PERSONS
OF
THE
GODHEAD
OF
ALL
OF
THE
DOCTRINES
OF
SCRIPTURE
THIS
IS
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
THE
BIBLE
IS
PREEMINENTLY
A
REVELATION
OF
GOD
THEREFORE
OUR
FIRST
OBJECTIVE
IN
STUDYING
THE
BIBLE
SHOULD
BE
TO
KNOW
GOD
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THAT
THERE
ARE
THREE
PERSONS
IN
THE
GODHEAD
TRINITY
GOD
THE
FATHER
GOD
THE
SONTHE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
GOD
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
ARE
INDIVIDUAL
PERSONS
WHO
ARE
ONE
IN
NATURE
MEANING
THAT
THEY
ARE
IDENTICAL
IN
NATURE
EACH
POSSESSING
THE
SAME
DIVINE
ATTRIBUTES
THEY
ARE
ALSO
EQUALLY
WORTHY
OF
OUR
WORSHIP
OUR
TRUST
AND
OUR
OBEDIENCE
CF
JOHN
II
THE
ATTRIBUTES
OR
CHARACTERISTICS
OF
THE
GODHEAD
A
GODS
NATURE
IS
REVEALED
IN
THE
NAME
HE
HAS
TAKEN
FOR
HIMSELF
JEHOVAH
HE
IS
THE
LIVING
GOD
ETERNAL
AND
UNCHANGING

BUT
GOD
IS
ALSO
HOLY
AND
RIGHTEOUS
HE
IS
ABSOLUTELY
WITHOUT
SIN
IN
HIS
NATURE
AND
SO
IS
INCAPABLE
OF
SINNING
IN

OR

OMNIPOTENT
ALMIGHTY
SOVEREIGN
WITH
UNLIMITED
POWER
OVER
ALL
CREATION
GOD
IS
INFINITE
IN
HIS
PRESENCE
WISDOM
AND
POWER
IT
IS
MY
CONVICTION
THAT
THE
WORK
OF
THE
LORD
IN
OUR
DAY
HAS
BECOME
VERY
MANCENTERED
AND
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
IN
OUR
CHURCHES
KNOW
VERY
LITTLE
ABOUT
GOD
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
LORDS
WORK
NEEDS
TO
BE
GODCENTERED
AND
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
OF
GOD
NEED
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
GOD
IS
SOVEREIGN
IN
ALL
THINGS
IN
THE
AFFAIRS
OF
NATIONS
IN
THE
LIVES
OF
ALL
PEOPLE
AND
IN
THE
CARRYING
OUT
OF
HIS
PURPOSES
REGARDING
SALVATION

WORKS
OF

WITH
MAN
