in
substance
we
are
told
that
the
penalty
for
sin
is
an
eternity
in
hell
we
are
told
that
jesus
paid
the
penalty
suffering
in
our
stead
but
jesus
did
not
spend
an
eternity
in
hell
this
objection
presupposes
the
forensic
substitution
theory
of
the
atonement
not
everyone
who
believes
in
the
atonement
understands
it
in
those
terms
for
an
expansion
of
this
statement
