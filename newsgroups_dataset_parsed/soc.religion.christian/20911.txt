MANY
CATHOLICS
WILL
DECIDE
TO
SIDE
WITH
THE
POPE
THERE
IS
SOME
SOUNDNESS
IN
THIS
BECAUSE
THE
PAPACY
IS
INFALLIBLE
SO
EVENTUALLY
SOME
POPE
WILL
STRAIGHTEN
ALL
THIS
OUT
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THERE
IS
ALSO
UNSOUNDNESS
IN
THIS
IN
THAT
IN
THE
SHORT
TERM
THE
POPES
MAY
INDEED
BE
WRONG
AND
SUCH
CATHOLICS
ARE
DOING
NOTHING
TO
HELP
THE
SITUATION
BY
OBEYING
THEM
WHERE
THEYRE
WRONG
IN
FACT
IF
THE
SITUATION
IS
GRAVE
ENOUGH
THEY
SIN
IN
OBEYING
HIM
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
THEYRE
WASTING
A
GREAT
OPPORTUNITY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
FAILING
TO
LOVE
CHRIST
IN
A
HEROIC
WAY
AT
THE
VERY
TIME
THAT
HE
NEEDS
THIS
BADLY
JOE
YOUR
LOGIC
EXCAPES
ME
IF
THE
PAPACY
IS
INFALLIBLE
AND
THIS
IS
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
THEN
THE
POPE
CANNOT
BE
WRONG
IF
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THIS
IS
NOT
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
BUT
A
MATTER
OF
CHURCH
LAW
THEN
WE
SHOULD
STILL
OBEY
AS
THE
POPE
IS
THE
LEGAL
HEAD
OF
THE
CHURCH
IN
OTHER
WORDS
GIVEN
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
INFALLIBILITY
WE
HAVE
NO
CHOICE
BUT
TO
OBEY

YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
FAQ
ON
INFALLIBILITY
THE
DOCTRINE
ON
INFALLIBILITY
DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
THE
POPE
IS
ALWAYS
RIGHT
ALL
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGIANS
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
A
NUMBER
OF
OCCASIONS
WHEN
THE
POPE
WAS
WRONG
THERE
APPEAR
TO
BE
TWO
ASPECTS
TO
INFALLIBILITY
ONE
IS
A
GENERAL
CONCEPT
THAT
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
THE
CHURCH
IS
PROTECTED
FROM
SERIOUS
ERROR
HOWEVER
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
ITS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
IT
TO
TAKE
WRONG
TURNS
AT
ONE
TIME
OR
ANOTHER
THE
MORE
SPECIFIC
CONCEPT
OF
PAPAL
INFALLIBILITY
IS
THAT
IN
VERY
SPECIFIC
CIRCUMSTANCES
A
PAPAL
STATEMENT
CAN
BE
KNOWN
TO
BE
INFALLIBLE
HOWEVER
A
RELATIVELY
SMALL
FRACTION
OF
STATEMENTS
MEET
THOSE
CRITERIA
THIS
DOES
NOT
ABSOLVE
CATHOLICS
FROM
THE
DUTY
TO
OBEY
EVEN
ORDINARY
TEACHINGS
OF
THE
POPE
HOWEVER
ONLY
A
FEW
TEACHINGS
ARE
MADE
IN
A
WAY
THAT
IS
EXPLICITLY
INFALLIBLE
