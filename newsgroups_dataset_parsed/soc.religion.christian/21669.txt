I
GUESS
I
HAVE
SOME
REAL
ETHICAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
PRACTICES
AT
THIS
CHURCH
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
BAPTISM
IS
AN
OVERRIDING
FACTOR
I
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
HONEST
WAY
TO
PROCEED
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
IS
BECOMING
MORE
TYPICAL
OF
CONGREGATIONS
AS
THE
SECOND
COMING
IS
PERCEIVED
TO
APPROACH
THERE
IS
A
REAL
ELEMENT
OF
DISPARATION
IN
THIS
MAKE
IT
HAPPEN
AT

I
WONDER
WHERE

OUTRAGED

THEN
BAPTIXED
WITHOUT

DOXENS
OF

SOME
AS

AND
UNACCOMPANIED

HOWEVER

THEY

IN
MANY
CASES
THEY
CONSENTED
ALTHOUGH
THEY
OR
THEIR
FAMILIES
ARE
NOT
OF
THE

THE
BAPTISMS
BY

HAVE
ANGERED
MANY
PARENTS
INCLUDING

LAMONTAGNE
A
METHODIST
AND

OF

WHO
WERE

WERE

I
FEEL
THATS
A
FALSE
PRETENSE
SAID

THEY

IF

CORNERSTONE
CHURCH

WE
TAKE
OUR
INSTRUCTIONS
FROM
THE
WORD

AND
GOD
HAS
COMMANDED
US
TO
BAPTIZE
CONVERTS
NO
ONE
CAN
SHOW
ME
ONE
PASSAGE
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHERE
IT
SAYS
THAT
PARENTAL
PERMISSION
IS
REQUIRED

IS
BAPTIZED

OF

CHURCH
CHURCH
OFFICIALS
DID
NOT
TELL
PARENTS
THEIR
CHILDREN
WOULD
BE
BAPTIZED
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDNT
ASK
IRWIN
SAID
MANY
OTHER
PARENTS
ALSO
FELT
THEY
WERE
SIMPLY
SENDING
THEIR
CHILDREN
TO
A
CARNIVAL
AT
THE
INVITATION
OF
THEIR
CHILDRENS
FRIENDS
WHO
WERE
MEMBERS
OF

CORNERSTONE
CHURCH
POLICE
SAID
CHHURCH
OFFICIALS
HAD
BROKEN
ON
LAWS
IN
BAPTIZING
THE
CHILDREN
BUT
INDICATED
THE
PARENTS
COULD
PURSUE
CIVIL
ACTION
ARENT
THESE
THE
SAME
BEHAVIORS
WE
CONDEMN
IN
THE
HARI
KRISHNAS
AND
OTHER
CULTS
I
THINK
THE
ISSUES
ARE
MORE
COMPLEX
THAN
THE
NEWSPAPER
ACCOUNT
MENTIONS
FIRST
IM
NOT
ENTIRELY
SURE
THAT
PARENTAL
CONSENT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
REQUIRED
THIS
WOULD
BE
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CLEAR
COMMANDMENT
TO
OBEY
PARENTS
BUT
IF
AN
OLDER
CHILD
INSISTED
ON
BEING
BAPTIZED
WITHOUT
THEIR
PARENTS
CONSENT
I
MIGHT
BE
WILLING
TO
DO
IT
HOWEVER
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
SERIOUS
STEP
AND
WOULD
WARRANT
MUCH
CAREFUL
DISCUSSION
THE
PROBLEM
I
FIND
HERE
IS
NOT
SO
MUCH
PARENTAL
CONSENT
AS
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOBODYS
CONSENT
WHETHER
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
INFANT
BAPTISM
OR
NOT
BAPTISM
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THE
SIGN
OF
ENTRY
INTO
A
CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY
IF
THERE
ISNT
A
COMMITMENT
FROM
SOMEBODY
WHETHER
PARENT
OR
CHILD
AND
NO
INTENT
TO
BECOME
PART
OF
THE
CHURCH
THE
BAPTISM
APPEARS
TO
BE
A
LIE
FURTHERMORE
IT
IS
LIKELY
TO
RAISE
SERIOUS
PRACTICAL
PROBLEMS
WHAT
IF
THE
CHILD
IS
FROM
A
BAPTIST
TRADITION
NORMALLY
WHEN
HE
REACHES
THE
AGE
OF
DECISION
HE
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
TO
MAKE
A
DECISION
AND
BE
BAPTIZED
BUT
HE
ALREADY
HAS
BEEN
BY
A
CHURCH
CLAIMING
TO
BE
A
BAPTIST
CHURCH
SO
DOES
HE
GET
REBAPTIZED
NEITHER
ANSWER
IS
REALLY
VERY
GOOD
IF
NOT
HES
BEING
ROBBED
OF
AN
EXPERIENCE
THAT
SHOULD
BE
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
TO
HIS
FAITH
