WRITES
BUT
RECENTLY
I
READ
PETER
BROWNS
BODY
AND
SOCIETY
IT
IS
VERY
WELL
RESEARCHED
AND
WELL
WRITTEN
BUT
IS
RAISES
SOME
VERY
UPSETTING
QUESTIONS
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
WERE
WEIRD
EVEN
MORE
SO
THAN
TODAYS
CARZY
FUNDIES
THEY
HAD
ODD
VIEWS
ON
SEX
ODDER
VIEWS
ON
THE
BODY
TOTALLY
LUDICROUS
VIEWS
ABOUT
DEMONS
AND
DISTINCTLY
UNCHARITABLE
VIEWS
ABOUT
OTHER
HUMAN
BEINGS
IF
POSSIBLE
LAST
I
HEARD
IT
WAS
OUT
OF
PRINT
BUT
THEY
WERE

BARBARA
HAMBLYS
SEARCH
THE
SEVEN
HILLS
IT
IS
HISTORICAL
FICTION
SET
IN
ROME
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
SHE
CAPTURES
THE
WEIRDNESS
OF
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
AND
YET
GIVES
GLIMPSES
OF
THE
HOLINESS
TOO
SOME
OF
THEIR
ODD
VIEWS
MAKE
A
LOT
MORE
SENSE
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
SOCIETY
THEY
LIVED
IN
I
FOUND
IT
A
REMARKABLY
POSITIVE
VIEW
OF
CHRISTIANITY
CONSIDERING
THAT
THE
AUTHOR
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
HERSELF
ANOTHER
PLUS
IS
THAT
EACH
CHAPTER
BEGINS
WITH
AN
ORIGINALSOURCE
QUOTE
SO
THAT
IT
MAKES
A
GOOD
STARTING
POINT
FOR
SERIOUS
RESEARCH
