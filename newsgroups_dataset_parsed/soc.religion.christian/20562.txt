ETHICS
VS
FREEDOM
BEING
A
PARENT
IN
NEED
OF
SOME
HELP
I
ASK
THAT
YOU
BEAR
WITH
ME
WHILE
I
DESCRIBE
THE
SITUATION
WHICH
PLAGUES
ME
I
AM
A
DIVORCED
FATHER
CHANCE
WOULD
HAVE
IT
THAT
MY
WEEKEND
WITH
MY
DAUGHTER
HAS
FALLEN
UPON
EASTER
WEEKEND
THIS
YEAR
ALTHOUGH
I
AM
PRESBYTERIAN
I
HAD
MARRIED
A
CATHOLIC
WOMAN
WE
DECIDED
THAT
THE
CATHOLIC
MORAY
OF
INDOCTRINATION
OF
THE
SPOUSE
INTO
THE
FAITH
WAS
TOO
CONFINING
AND
RESTRICTIVE
DUE
TO
TIME
AS
WE
HAD
ALREADY
SET
A
DATE
AND
WE
WERE
MARRIED
IN
A
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
WHICH
WAS
NONDENOMINATIONAL
DURING
THE
YEARS
OF
OUR
MARRIAGE
WE
DID
NOT
OFTEN
ATTEND
CHURCH
WHEN
OUR
DAUGHTER
WAS
BORN
SOME
YEARS
LATER
MY
WIFE
INSISTED
THAT
SHE
BE
BAPTISED
AS
CATHOLIC
THIS
WASNT
A
PROBLEM
WITH
ME
DURING
A
SEPARATION
OF
FIVE
YEARS
MY
EXWIFE
WAS
TAKEN
ILL
WITH
A
DISEASE
THAT
AFFECTED
HER
MENTAL
CAPACITIES
SHE
WAS
CONFINED
TO
A
MENTAL
WARD
FOR
TWO
MONTHS
BEFORE
IT
WAS
DIAGNOSED
IT
HAS
SINCE
BEEN
TREATED
EFFECTIVELY
IN
OTHER
WORDS
PROFESSIONALS
HAVE
DEEMED
HER
A
FUNCTIONING
MEMBER
OF
SOCIETY
DURING
THE
RECUPERATION
MY
EXWIFE
HAS
EMBRACED
BUDDISM
HER
INFLUENCE
OVER
MY
DAUGHTER
HAS
BEEN
SUBSTANTIAL
AND
HAS
PRIMARILY
ALLOWED
ME
ONLY
SATURDAY
VISITATION
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
DURING
THIS
PERIOD
I
HAVE
READ
BIBLE
STUDY
BOOKS
TO
MY
DAUGHTER
AND
TRIED
TO
KEEP
HER
AWARE
OF
HER
CHRISTIAN
HERITAGE
LAST
FALL
OUR
DIVORCE
WAS
FINALIZED
AFTER
A
YEAR
OF
VISCIOUS
DIVORCE
HEARINGS
AT
THAT
TIME
I
WAS
AWARDED
VISITATION
RIGHTS
EVERY
OTHER
WEEKEND
AT
THAT
TIME
I
STARTED
TAKING
MY
DAUGHTER
TO
CHURCH
QUITE
OFTEN
ALTHOUGH
NOT
EVERY
WEEKEND
I
DID
THIS
TO
ATTEMPT
TO
STRENGTHEN
THE
CHRISTIAN
ETHIC
AND
EXPOSE
HER
TO
A
RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITY
TODAY
EASTER
SUNDAY
I
TOOK
MY
DAUGHTER
TO
CHURCH
WHEN
IT
CAME
TIME
FOR
COMMUNION
MY
DAUGHTER
TOOK
THE
BREAD
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
BUT
LEFT
THE
WINE
THE
BLOOD
OF
CHRIST
PROFESSING
THAT
SHE
WAS
TOO
YOUNG
FOR
WINE
SHE
THEN
BALLED
THE
BREAD
UP
IN
HER
HAND
AND
TRIED
TO
DESCRETELY
THROW
IT
UNDER
THE
PEW
IN
FRONT
OF
US
I
FEEL
THIS
WAS
A
SLAP
IN
THE
FACE
TO
ME
MY
RELIGION
AND
AN
AFRONT
TO
HER
RELIGIOUS
HERITAGE
IT
CAN
BE
CONSTRUED
AS
BREAKING
SEVERAL
OF
THE
COMMANDMENTS
IF
YOU
TRY
I
REALLY
FELT
DISHONORED
BY
THE
ACTION
MY
DAUGHTER
IS
ONLY
NINE
YEARS
OLD
BUT
I
THINK
SHE
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
OLD
AND
MATURE
ENOUGH
TO
REALIZE
HER
ACTIONS
I
HAVE
DIFFICULTY
BLAMING
HER
DIRECTLY
FOR
RELIGIOUS
TEACHINGS
HER
MOTHER
SWEARS
TO
BUT
WHEN
I
DISCUSSED
THIS
WITH
MY
DAUGHTER
SHE
MADE
IT
CLEAR
SHE
BELIEVED
IN
BUDDHISM
AND
NOT
CHRISTIANITY
MY
INITIAL
RESPONSE
OF
ANGER
MODERATED
WAS
TO
SUGGEST
IF
THERE
IS
NO
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
THEN
WHY
DOES
SHE
CELEBRATE
EASTER
OR
CHRISTMAS
I
SUGGESTED
I
WOULD
NEVER
FORCE
HER
TO
PRACTICE
MY
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
BY
CELEBRATING
HOLIDAYS
WITH
HER
AGAIN
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
DRIVE
HER
FROM
THE
FOLD
AND
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
ALLOW
HER
TO
CONTINUE
PRACTICING
BUDDHISM
AS
THOUGH
I
HAD
A
CHOICE
SEEING
HER
ONLY
FOR
TWO
DAYS
OUT
OF
FOURTEEN
BUT
I
WANT
HER
TO
WANT
TO
EMBRACE
CHRISTIANITY
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
RESPONSE
PLEASE
EMAIL
ME
A
COPY
IM
NOT
A
REGULAR
READER
OF
THIS
NEWSGROUP
NATURALLY
FEEL
FREE
TO

TOO
THANKS
AND
I
HOPE
YOUVE
HAD
A
HAPPY
EASTER
