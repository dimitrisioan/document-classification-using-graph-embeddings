APR
SUSAN
HARWOOD
KACZMARCZIK
WRITES
TO
ALL
WE
SUSPECT
THATS
BECAUSE
ONE
PARTY
TO
THE
ENVIRONMENTAL
DISPUTE
THINKS
THE
EARTH
IS
SANCTIFIED
ITS
CLEAR
THAT
MUCH
OF
THE
ENVIRONMENTALIST
ENERGY
IS
DERIVED
FROM
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
CALLED
THE
RELIGIOUS
LEFT
A
SECULAR
OR
EVEN
PAGAN
FANATICISM
THAT
NOW
WORSHIPS
SUCH
GODS
AS
NATURE
AND
GENDER
WITH
A
REVERENCE
FORMERLY
ACCORDED
REAL
RELIGIONS
EMPHASIS
MINE
SHK
FIRST
OF
ALL
SECULAR
AND
PAGAN
ARE
NOT
SYNONYMS
PAGAN
WHICH
IS
SHK
DERIVED
FROM
THE
LATIN
PAGANUS
MEANS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
IT
IS
IN
SHK
FACT
A
COGNATE
WITH
THE
ITALIAN
PAISANO
WHICH
MEANS
PEASANT
SHK
PAGANISM
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
INCLUDES
A
REVERENCE
FOR
THE
PLANET
AND
SHK
ALL
LIFE
ON
THE
PLANET
STEMMING
FROM
THE
BELIEF
THAT
ALL
LIFE
IS
SHK
INTERCONNECTED
SO
RATHER
THAN
BE
SOMETHING
SECULAR
IT
IS
SOMETHING
SHK
VERY
SACRED
I
WOULD
GO
FURTHER
AND
SAY
THAT
MUCH
OF
THE
DAMAGE
TO
THE
ENVIRONMENT
HAS
BEEN
CAUSED
BY
THE
SECULAR
WORLDVIEW
OR
BY
THE
HUMANIST
WORLDVIEW
AND
ESPECIALLY
BY
THE
SECULAR
HUMANIST
WORLDVIEW
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
ALL
SECULAR
HUMANISTS
ARE
NECESSARILY
AVID
DESTROYERS
OF
THE
ENVIRONMENT
AND
I
AM
SURE
THAT
THERE
ARE
MANY
WHO
ARE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
ENVIRONMENT
BUT
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
RENAISSANCE
AND
REF
ORMATION
IN
WESTERN
EUROPE
MAN
BECAME
THE
CENTRE
OR
THE
FOCUS
OF
CULTURE
HENCE
HUMANISM
THIS
CONSCIOUSNESS
WAS
ALSO
SECULAR
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
IT
WAS
CONCERNED
PRIMARILY
WITH
THE
PRESENT
AGE
R
ATHER
THAN
THE
AGE
TO
COME
CAPITALISM
AROSE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AND
THE
POWER
OF
ECONOMICS
BECAME
CENTRAL
IN
PHILOSOPHY
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
ECONOMICS
DID
NOT
EXIST
BEFORE
SIMPLY
THAT
IT
BEGAN
TO
DOMINATE
THE
CONSCIOUS
CULTURAL
VALUES
OF
WESTERN
EUROPEAN
SOCIETY
AND
ITS
OFFSHOOTS
THIS
CULTURAL
SHIFT
WAS
IN
ITS
LATER
STAGES
ACCOMPANIED
BY
INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTIONS
AND
THE
VALUES
THAT
JUSTIFIED
THEM
THERE
WAS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
CULTURAL
SHIFT
IN
THE
MEANING
OF
ECONOMICS
FROM
THE
CHRISTIAN
VIEW
OF
MAN
AS
THE
ECONOMOS
THE
STEWARD
OF
CREATION
TO
THE
SECULAR
IDEA
OF
MAN
AS
THE
SLAVE
OF
ECONOMIC
FORCES
AND
POWERS
THERE
WERE
DENOMINATIONAL
DIFFERENCES
AMONG
THE
NEW
WORSHIPPERS
OF
MAMMON
FOR
SOME
THE
NAME
OF
THE
DEITY
WAS
THE
FREE
REIN
OF
THE
MARKET
MECHANISM
WHILE
FOR
OTHERS
IT
WAS
THE
DIALECTICAL
FORCES
OF
HISTORY
BUT
IN
BOTH
THE
CAPITALIST
WEST
AND
THE
SOCIALIST
EAST
THE
ENVIRONMENT
WAS
SACRIFICED
ON
THE
ALTAR
OF
MAMMON
THE
SITUATION
WAS
MITIGATED
IN
THE
WEST
BECAUSE
THOS
E
WHO
WERE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
DAMAGE
TO
THE
ENVIRONMENT
HAD
MORE
FREEDOM
TO
OPPOSE
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
AND
STATE
THEIR
CASE
