SCOTT
MUNNS
WRITES
I
AM
DOING
A
DORMITORY
BIBLE
DISCUSSION
WITH
MY
CHRISTIAN
ROOMMATE
AND
IN
JESUS
NAME
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PEOPLE
BEFORE
JESUS
THEY
PRAYED
TO
GOD
AND
HE
LISTENED
THEN
IN
SPITE
OF
THEIR
SINS
WHY
CANT
IT
BE
THE
SAME
WAY
NOW
INSERT
HUGE
DELETION
OF
ALL
FOLLOWING
MATERIAL
SINCE
IT
HAD
LITTLE
RELEVANCE
TO
WHAT
IVE
FOUND
OK
THE
PEOPLE
BEFORE
JESUS
DIDNT
HAVE
JESUS
RIGHT
SO
FAR
IVE
ANNOUNCED
THAT
SPACE
IS
A
VACUUM
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
LIVED
DURING
THE
TIME
JESUS
LIVED
ESPECIALLY
DISCIPLES
WERE
TAUGHT
THIS
I
TELL
YOU
THE
TRUTH
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
FAITH
IN
ME
WILL
DO
WHAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
HE
WILL
DO
EVEN
GREATER
THINGS
THAN
THESE
BECAUSE
I
AM
GOING
TO
THE
FATHER
AND
I
WILL
DO
WHATEVER
YOU
ASK
IN
MY
NAME
SO
THAT
THE
SON
MAY
BRING
GLORY
TO
THE
FATHER
YOU
MAY
ASK
ME
FOR
ANYTHING
IN
MY
NAME
AND
I
WILL
DO
IT
JOHN
SO
JESUS
ASKED
THEM
TO
PRAY
FOR
THINGS
IN
HIS
NAME
SINCE
THAT
TIME
THE
REQUEST
HAS
BEEN
THE
SAME
NOT
TO
ASK
FOR
INTERCESSION
FROM
OTHER
BEINGS
BUT
FROM
JESUS
REMEMBER
THAT
THERE
IS
ONE
GOD
AND
ONE
MEDIATOR
BETWEEN
GOD
AND
MEN
THE
MAN
CHRIST
JESUS
WHO
GAVE
HIMSELF
AS
A
RANSOM
FOR
ALL
MENTHE
TESTIMONY
GIVEN
IN
ITS
PROPER
TIME
TIMOTHY
ALSO
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
OF
THOSE
PRIESTS
TALKING
ABOUT
PRIESTS
AMONG
THE
HEBREWS
SINCE
DEATH
PREVENTED
THEM
FROM
CONTINUING
IN
OFFICE
BUT
BECAUSE
JESUS
LIVES
FOREVER
HE
HAS
A
PERMANENT
PRIESTHOOD
THEREFORE
HE
IS
ABLE
TO
SAVE
COMPLETELY
THOSE
WHO
COME
TO
GOD
THROUGH
HIM
BECAUSE
HE
ALWAYS
LIVES
TO
INTERCEDE
FOR
THEM
HEBREWS
HEBREWS
IS
ALSO
FULL
OF
AREAS
TALKING
ABOUT
JESUS
BEING
OUR
MEDIATOR
RATHER
THAN
ANY
OTHER
MAN
JOE
FISHER
THE
PEOPLE
BEFORE
JESUS
DIDNT
HAVE
JESUS
RIGHT
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
OBVIOUS
AS
YOU
THINK
IN
WHAT
SENSE
TO
YOU
MEAN
DIDNT
HAVE
CHRISTIAN
THOUGHT
HAS
GENERALLY
SAID
THAT
THEY
HAD
JESUS
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
THEY
WERE
SAVED
BY
HIS
DEATH
GOD
IS
NOT
BOUND
BY
OUR
CHRONOLOGY
SO
IN
SOME
REAL
SPIRITUAL
SENSE
THEY
DID
HAVE
JESUS
EVEN
IN
TERMS
OF
KNOWLEDGE
WHILE
THEY
SURELY
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
EXPLICIT
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
WE
HAVE
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
NORMALLY
SEEN
MESSIANIC
PROPHECY
AS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
JESUS
EVEN
IF
KNOWLEDGE
FROM
