until
madge

the

has
been
discussed
since
privately
in
email
amongst
their
participants
and
ive
received
some
of
it
a
fairly
large
file
approx
kb
of
comments
made
on
the
march

just
scan
through
this
newsgroup
as
at
bps
i
couldnt
possibly
read
it
all
i
would
be
glad
to
send
it
along
i
believe
that
it
would
be
of
interest
to
people
here
i
hope
that
anyone
who
remembers
seeing
rev
troy
perrys
performance
at
the
march
on
washington
will
see
for
themselves
just
how
inconceivable
it
is
to
mix
christianity
with
homosexuality
sean
patrick
ryanfssprauroraalaskaedu
or
seanfredscojonescom
you
might
visit
some
congregations
of
christians
who
happen
to
be
homosexuals
that
are
spiritfilled
believers
not
mccrs
before
you
go
lumping
us
all
together
with
troy
perry
the
lord
is
working
in
our
community
the
homosexual
community
that
is
hes
not
asking
us
to
change
our
sexual
nature
but
he
is
calling
us
to
practice
the
morality
that
he
established
from
the
beginning
isnt
satan
having
a
hayday
pitting
christian
against
christian
over
any
issue
he
can
especially
homosexuality
lets
reach
the
homosexuals
for
christ
lets
not
try
to
change
them
just
need
to
bring
them
to
christ
if
he
doesnt
want
them
to
be
gay
he
can
change
that
if
they
are
living
a
moral
life
committed
to
someone
of
the
same
sex
and
god
is
moving
in
their
lives
who
are
we
to
tell
them
they
have
to
change
thats
my
two
cent
god
bless
you
