CHRISTIANS

DEAN

JR
WRITES
HOLD
IT
I
SAID
THAT
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
TRUE
HOWEVER
DISCERNING
EXACTLY
WHAT
JESUS
PAUL
AND
COMPANY
WERE
TRYING
TO
SAY
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
SO
EASY
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
PAUL
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
ALL
WOMEN
SHOULD
BEHAVE
THAT
WAY
RATHER
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
AT
THE
TIME
THE
WOMEN
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
TO
WOULD
BEST
AVOID
VOLUBILITY
AND
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
THIS
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
MAINTAINING
A
PROPER
WITNESS
TOWARD
OTHERS
REMEMBER
THAT
ANY
NUMBER
OF
RELATIVISTIC
STATEMENTS
CAN
BE
DERIVED
FROM
ABSOLUTES
FOR
INSTANCE
IT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
STRIVE
FOR
PEACE
HOWEVER
THIS
DOES
NOT
RULE
OUT
TRYING
TO
MAINTAIN
WORLD
PEACE
BY
RESORTING
TO
VIOLENCE
ON
OCCASION
YES
MY
OPINION
I
AGREE
THAT
THERE
IS
TRUTH
IN
SCRIPTURE
THERE
ARE
PRINCIPLES
TO
BE
LEARNED
FROM
IT
CLAIMING
THAT
THAT
TRUTH
IS
ABSOLUTE
THOUGH
SEEMS
TO
IMPLY
A
LITERAL
READING
OF
THE
BIBLE
IF
IT
WERE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
CONSTANT
ACROSS
TIME
CULTURE
ETC
THEN
NO
INTERPRETATION
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
I
STRONGLY
DISAGREE
THAT
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
WOULD
NOT
REQUIRE
INTERPRETATION
THATS
BECAUSE
TRUTH
MAY
BE
ABSOLUTE
BUT
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
OBVIOUS
LIKE
SO
MANY
THINGS
THE
TRUTH
IS
ALWAYS
SUBJECT
TO
MISINTERPRETATION
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
THAT
WE
ARE
REACHING
AN
IMPASSE
HERE
WHICH
IS
WHY
I
DEIGN
FROM
COMMENTING
MUCH
FURTHER
SURE
THE
BIBLE
PREACHES
ABSOLUTE
TRUTHS
HOWEVER
EXACTLY
WHAT
THOSE
TRUTHS
ARE
IS
SOMETIMES
A
MATTER
OF
CONFUSION
AS
I
SAID
THE
BIBLE
DOES
PREACH
ABSOLUTE
TRUTHS
SOMETIMES
THOSE
FUNDAMENTAL
PRINCIPLES
ARE
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
AT
LEAST
TO
EVANGELICALS
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
ARROGANCE
COMES
IN
TO
PLAY
SINCE
THESE
PRINCIPLES
ARE
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
TO
EVANGELICALS
MAYBE
THE
REST
OF
US
SHOULD
JUST
TAKE
THEIR
WORD
FOR
IT
MAYBE
IT
ISNT
AT
ALL
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
THEIR
FUNDAMENTAL
PRINCIPLES
ARE
EITHER
FUNDAMENTAL
OR
PRINCIPLES
NOW
HOLD
IT
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
CHRISTIANS
CANNOT
BE
ARROGANT
INDEED
AS
MANY
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
ON
SRC
HAVE
STRESSED
BEFORE
THIS
IS
A
TRAP
THAT
CHRISTIANS
MUST
ALWAYS
BE
WARY
ABOUT
HOWEVER
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
THE
ABSOLUTES
ESTABLISHED
BY
THE
BIBLE
YOU
ARE
NECESSARILY
BEING
ARROGANT
A
CHRISTIAN
CAN
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
IS
ABSOLUTE
BUT
HE
OR
SHE
SHOULD
NOT
EXPECT
THIS
TO
BE
IMMEDIATELY
EVIDENT
TO
EVERYONE
SO
I
THINK
THAT
YOUR
POSITION
IS
THE
BIBLE
IS
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
BUT
AS
WE
ARE
PRONE
TO
ERROR
IN
OUR
INTERPRETATION
WE
CANNOT
RELIABLY
DETERMINE
IF
WE
HAVE
FIGURED
OUT
WHAT
THAT
TRUTH
IS
DID
I
GET
THAT
RIGHT
NOT
QUITE
YOU
SAY
THAT
ACCORDING
TO
MY
STANCE
WE
CANNOT
RELIABLY
DETERMINE
WHAT
IS
TRUE
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
I
SAID
I
SAY
THAT
AS
FALLIBLE
HUMAN
BEINGS
WE
CANNOT
DISCERN
THE
TRUTH
WITH
CERTAINTY
THE
DISTINCTION
IS
SUBTLE
YET
IMPORTANT
WHEN
A
SCIENTIST
PERFORMS
AN
EXPERIMENT
HE
CAN
CLAIM
THAT
HIS
RESULTS
ARE
RELIABLE
WITHOUT
CLAIMING
THAT
ABSOLUTELY
NO
MISTAKE
WHATSOEVER
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
HE
CAN
ADMIT
THAT
HE
COULD
BE
MISTAKEN
WITHOUT
SACRIFICING
HIS
CONVICTIONS
NOBODY
CAN
ESTABLISH
WHAT
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IS
WITH
CERTAINTY
THROUGHOUT
THE
CENTURIES
PHILOSOPHERS
HAVE
ARGUED
ABOUT
WHAT
WE
CAN
KNOW
WITH
COMPLETE
CERTAINTY
AND
WHAT
WE
CANNOT
DESCARTES
MADE
A
STEP
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION
WHEN
HE
UTTERED
COGITO
ERGO
SUM
YET
WE
HAVE
NOT
ADVANCED
MUCH
BEYOND
THAT
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
ASIDE
FROM
YOU
EXIST
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
COMPUTER
TERMINAL
YOU
ARE
USING
EXISTS
IF
SO
CAN
YOU
BE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
ABOUT
THAT
ARE
YOU
SURE
IT
IS
NOT
SOME
GRAND
ILLUSION
OF
COURSE
YOU
HAVE
NO
SUCH
ASSURANCE
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
HOWEVER
THAT
FOR
ALL
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
YOU
CAN
BE
CERTAIN
THAT
THEY
EXIST
SO
IT
IS
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
THE
MOST
MATURE
CHRISTIANS
I
KNOW
HAVE
DEEP
CONVICTIONS
ABOUT
ABSOLUTE
MORALITY
YET
THEY
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
NONZERO
PROBABILITY
THAT
THEY
ARE
WRONG
THIS
DOES
NOT
HOWEVER
MEAN
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
OR
DO
ABANDON
THESE
ABSOLUTES
WHATS
THE
POINT
OF
SPENDING
ALL
THIS
TIME
CLAIMING
AND
DEFENDING
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
WHEN
WE
CAN
NEVER
KNOW
WHAT
THOSE
TRUTHS
ARE
AND
WE
CAN
NEVER
OR
AT
LEAST
SHOULDNT
ACT
UPON
THEM
WHAT
PRACTICAL
DIFFERENCE
CAN
THIS
MAKE
AS
I
SAID
WE
CAN
NEVER
BE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
THAT
WE
ARE
CORRECT
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
WE
CANNOT
BE
CERTAIN
ENOUGH
IN
LIGHT
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
TO
RENDER
ALL
DOUBTS
