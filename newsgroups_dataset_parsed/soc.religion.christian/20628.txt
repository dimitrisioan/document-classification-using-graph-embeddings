re
the
arrogance
of
christians
they
believe
the
danger
is
real
but
others
may
not
does
that
mean
that
the
first
group
are
necessarily
arrogant
in
warning
others
of
the
danger
does
it
mean
that
they
are
saying
that
their
beliefs
are
correct
and
all
others
are
false
some
might
indeed
react
to
opposition
with
arrogance
and
behave
in
an
arrogant
manner
but
that
is
a
personal
idiocyncracy
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
are
all
arrogant
no
the
members
of
the
first
group
are
not
necessarily
arrogant
but
when
i
ask
them
if
they
are
absolutely
certain
that
the
volcano
will
erupt
i
expect
them
to
say
so
no
but
ive
chosen
to
believe
some
knowledgable
people
who
have
determined
that
the
volcano
will
erupt
rather
than
yes
i
am
absolutely
certain
when
it
comes
to
religious
discussions
arrogance
or
at
best
naivete
is
reflected
in
the
latter
type
of
statement
