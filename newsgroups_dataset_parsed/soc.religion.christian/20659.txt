SOME
QUESTIONS
FROM
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
HI
I
AM
NEW
TO
THIS
NEWSGROUP
AND
ALSO
FAIRLY
NEW
TO
CHRISTIANITY
I
WAS
RAISED
AS
A
UNITARIAN
AND
HAVE
SPENT
THE
BETTER
PART
OF
MY
LIFE
AS
AN
AGNOSTIC
BUT
RECENTLY
I
HAVE
DEVELOPED
THE
FIRM
CONVICTION
THAT
THE
CHRISTIAN
MESSAGE
IS
CORRECT
AND
I
HAVE
ACCEPTED
JESUS
INTO
MY
LIFE
I
AM
HAPPY
BUT
I
REALIZE
I
AM
VERY
IGNORANT
ABOUT
MUCH
OF
THE
BIBLE
AND
QUITE
POSSIBLY
ABOUT
WHAT
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
HOLD
AS
TRUE
THIS
I
AM
TRYING
TO
RECTIFY
BY
READING
THE
BIBLE
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
HELPFUL
TO
ALSO
READ
A
GOOD
INTERPRETATIONCOMMENTARY
ON
THE
BIBLE
OR
OTHER
RELEVANT
ASPECTS
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
ONE
OF
MY
QUESTIONS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
IS
CAN
ANYONE
RECOMMEND
A
GOOD
READING
LIST
OF
THEOLOGICAL
WORKS
INTENDED
FOR
A
LAY
PERSON
I
HAVE
ANOTHER
QUESTION
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
I
AM
NOT
YET
AFFILIATED
WITH
ANY
ONE
CONGREGATION
ASIDE
FROM
MATTERS
OF
TASTE
WHAT
CRITERIA
SHOULD
ONE
USE
IN
CHOOSING
A
CHURCH
I
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
VARIOUS
PROTESTANT
DENOMINATIONS
THANKS
FOR
READING
MY
POST
SINCERELY
STEVE
HOSKINS
ASIDE
FROM
A
COMMENTARY
YOU
MIGHT
ALSO
WANT
TO
CONSIDER
AN
INTRODUCTION
THESE
ARE
BOOKS
INTENDED
FOR
USE
IN
UNDERGRADUATE
BIBLE
COURSES
THEY
GIVE
HISTORICAL
BACKGROUND
DISCUSSION
OF
LITERARY
STYLES
ETC
AND
GENERALLY
THEY
HAVE
GOOD
BIBLIGRAPHIES
FOR
FURTHER
READING
I
TYPICALLY
RECOMMEND
KEE
FROEHLICH
AND
YOUNGS
NT
INTRODUCTION
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SOME
GOOD
ONEVOLUME
COMMENTARIES
THEY
OFTEN
HAVE
BACKGROUND
ARTICLES
THAT
ARE
HELPFUL
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
RECOMMENDATION
THESE
DAYS
WOULD
BE
HARPERS
BIBLE
COMMENTARY
I
THINK
THERE
MAY
BE
A
COUPLE
OF
BOOKS
WITH
THIS
TITLE
THIS
IS
A
FAIRLY
RECENT
ONE
LIKE
ABOUT
DONE
IN
COOPERATION
WITH
THE
SOCIETY
FOR
BIBLICAL
CRITICISM
IF
YOU
ARE
COMMITTED
TO
INERRANCY
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
PREFER
SOMETHING
MORE
CONSERVATIVE
I
DONT
READ
A
LOT
OF
CONSERVATIVE
BOOKS
BUT
A
COMMENTARY
I
LOOKED
AT
BY
DONALD
GUTHRIE
LOOKED
RATHER
GOOD
HE
HAS
A
NT
INTRODUCTION
AND
HES
ALSO
EDITOR
OF
EERDMANS
BIBLE
COMMENTARY
