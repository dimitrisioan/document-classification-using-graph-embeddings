RE
ARSENOKOITAI
NT
MEANING
OF
METAEXEGESIS
CONVICTION
OF
SIN
PART
II
LET
ME
RETURN
TO
THE
QUESTION
STIPULATING
THAT
PAUL
MEANT
HIS
USE
OF
ARSEONKOITAI
TO
REFER
MORE
OR
LESS
EXACTLY
TO
THE
LEVITICAL
PROHIBITION
OF
MALEMALE
SEX
IN
ORDER
TO
BRING
OUT
THE
PROBLEMS
MOST
CLEARLY
ILL
ALSO
STIPULATE
WHAT
I
THINK
IS
FAR
LESS
PLAUSIBLE
THAT
PAUL
COINED
THE
TERM
FOR
THIS
USAGE
THE
QUESTION
I
WANT
TO
TURN
TO
IS
WHAT
THAT
WOULD
MEAN
FOR
PAULS
READERS
AND
FOR
LATER
CHRISTIANS
THIS
SHOULD
BE
SHORTER
THAN
MY
LAST
NOTE
AS
WE
WILL
SEE
THAT
THIS
QUESTION
RAPIDLY
CONFRONTS
US
WITH
SOME
OF
THE
MAJOR
DIVISIONS
WITHIN
CHRISTS
BODY
AND
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
OPEN
THE
GATES
FOR
FLAMES
ACROSS
ANY
OF
THE
TERRIBLE
CHASMS
THAT
SEPARATE
ANY
OF
US
FROM
OUR
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
MY
OWN
BIASES
LOOSELY
CHARACTERIZABLE
AS
LIBERAL
WILL
BE
EVIDENT
BUT
I
AM
NOT
GRINDING
AN
AXE
HERE
SO
MUCH
AS
TRYING
TO
GET
ALL
PARTIES
TO
SEE
THAT
IT
MAY
BE
HARD
TO
REACH
CLOSURE
WHEN
THE
ISSUES
INVOLVED
STRIKE
AT
THE
HEART
OF
WHAT
WE
EACH
IN
OUR
OWN
DIFFERENT
WAYS
SEE
AS
CRUCIAL
TO
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
SO
STIPULATING
PAULS
INTENT
THE
IMMEDIATE
QUESTION
IS
HOW
CAN
HIS
READERS
UNDERSTAND
THIS
INTENT
AND
FOLLOWING
ON
THAT
QUESTION
THERE
IS
A
SECOND
ONE
WHAT
IS
OUR
PROPER
ACTION
IF
WE
DO
MANAGE
TO
UNDERSTAND
HIM
SINCE
PAUL
GIVES
NOT
A
SINGLE
CLUE
ABOUT
HIS
MEANING
IN
THE
TEXT
OF
CORINTHIANS
THERE
ARE
TWO
POSITIVE
ANSWERS
AND
ONE
NEGATIVE
TO
THIS
QUESTION
A
PAUL
OR
APOLLOS
OR
SOMEONE
IN
THE
APOSTOLIC
COMMUNITY
HAS
CONVEYED
TO
THE
CORINTHIANS
THE
THENTRADITIONAL
JEWISH
CONDEM
NATION
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
AND
PAUL
EXPECTS
THEM
TO
BE
SUFFICIENTLY
WELLTUTORED
BY
THIS
TRADITION
THAT
HE
NEEDS
NO
FUTHER
EXPLANATION
I
SHOULD
NOTE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
IN
THE
LETTER
OR
IN
CORINTHIANS
FOR
SUCH
A
SUPPOSITION
B
THE
SPIRIT
WILL
TEACH
US
WHAT
PAUL
MEANS
OR
IF
NOT
PAUL
WHAT
GOD
MEANS
BEHIND
PAULS
INSPIRED
WORDCHOICE
C
WE
DONT
KNOW
AND
CANNOT
GUESS
TO
WITHIN
ANY
BETTER
PRE
CISION
HERE
THAN
FOR
COMPARISON
IN
THE
PARALLEL
USE
BY
PAUL
IN
THE
SAME
PASSAGE
OF
THE
WORD
PLEONEKTAI
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
MORE
IF
YOU
THINK
THAT
ARESEONKOITAI
IS
OBVIOUS
FROM
ITS
ROOTS
TRY
CUTTING
YOUR
TEETH
ON
THIS
WORD
THE
NEB
TRANSLATES
IT
AS
GRABBERS
OR
EVEN
METHUSOI
DRUNKARDS
AT
LEAST
THIS
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
BEING
A
COMMON
INSULT
SO
THAT
AT
LEAST
THERE
IS
SOME
HINT
AS
TO
ITS
MEANING
THE
THREE
POSITIONS
MORE
OR
LESS
IF
I
CAN
BE
ALLOWED
SOME
EXAGGERATION
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
DEFINE
A
CLASSICAL
CATHOLIC
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
TRADITION
ONE
FORM
OF
PROTESTANT
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
AND
A
LIBERALCRITICAL
DEMAND
FOR
EVIDENCE
ALL
THREE
POSITIONS
HAVE
STRENGTHS
AND
WEAKNESSES
AD
A
IT
IS
UNQUESTIONABLE
THAT
THE
GOSPEL
WAS
PREACHED
IN
AND
BY
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
CHRISTS
DISCIPLES
AND
THEIR
SUCCESSORS
AND
THAT
OUR
NT
SCRIPTURE
ITSELF
EMERGES
FROM
THIS
COMMUNAL
TRADITION
BUT
ITS
ALSO
THE
CASE
THAT
WE
KNOW
LITTLE
OR
NOTHING
ABOUT
THIS
TRADITION
UNTIL
ALMOST
A
CENTURY
AFTER
PAUL
WHICH
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
TRADITION
ONLY
AFTER
SEVERAL
GENERATIONS
OF
POSSIBLY
CONFUSED
TRANSMISSION
THE
SCRIPTURE
IS
ITSELF
OUR
ONLY
DOCUMENTATION
OF
THE
TRADITION
IN
THE
CRITICAL
ERA
AD
B
IF
WE
ARE
NOT
BORN
OF
WATER
AND
SPIRIT
TO
REVERT
TO
JOHN
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
EXPLAIN
PAUL
THEN
WE
HAVE
NO
MORE
HOPE
OF
UNDER
STANDING
THE
GOSPEL
THAN
NICODEMUS
HAD
NEITHER
THE
TRADITIONS
OF
MEN
NOR
THE
VAIN
ELEVATION
OF
OUR
OWN
REASON
CAN
PREVENT
THE
SPIRIT
FROM
BLOWING
WHERE
IT
WILL
THE
PARACLETE
IS
A
KAMIKAZE
BUT
THE
DOWNSIDE
OF
PROTESTANT
BELIEF
IN
THE
EFFICACY
OF
THE
SPIRIT
AS
OUR
GUIDE
IN
SCRIPTURE
IS
THAT
THE
WING
OF
PROTESTANTISM
THAT
TAKES
THIS
MOST
SERIOUSLY
IS
ALSO
THE
MOST
FRAGMENTED
OVER
DIVERGENT
UNDERSTANDING
SUPPOSEDLY
DERIVED
FROM
THE
CLEAR
WORD
OF
GOD
NOTE
CLASSICAL
LUTHERAN
CALVINIST
AND
ANGLICAN
THOUGHT
CONSTRAINS
SCRIPTURE
TO
BE
READ
WITHIN
TRADITION
EVEN
WHILE
RESERVING
JUDGMENT
AGAINST
TRADITION
OUT
OF
SCRIPTURE
THE
MORE
BIZARRE
FORMS
OF
I
WILL
READ
SCRIPTURE
MY
WAY
ARE
PRIMARILY
A
FRINGE
ASPECT
OF
CULTIC
PROTESTANTISM
THE
MAIN
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
APPARENTLY
NO
MEANS
FOR
ONE
PERSON
TO
CONVEY
TO
ANOTHER
WHAT
THAT
ONE
MAY
FEEL
IS
TEACHING
RECEIVED
FROM
THE
SPIRIT
AND
HISTORY
SHOWS
INCREDIBLE
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
CHRISTIANS
ON
THIS
POINT
EACH
IN
HIS
OWN
MIND
CONVINCED
THAT
HE
IS
LED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
NO
ONE
CAN
SERIOUSLY
URGE
POINT
B
WITHOUT
SOME
SENSE
OF
ITS
POTENTIAL
FOR
SETTING
CHRISTIAN
AGAINST
CHRISTIAN
TO
WHAT
PURPOSE
AD
C
THE
CRITICAL
APPROACH
HAS
THE
DISTINCT
ADVANTAGE
THAT
WHEN
IT
CAN
REACH
A
CONCLUSION
IT
CAN
LAY
OUT
THE
DATA
IN
A
WAY
WHICH
IS
OPEN
TO
ALL
THE
WEAKNESS
IS
AN
OBVIOUS
COROLLARY
THIS
IS
NOT
USUALLY
POSSIBLE
IF
I
MAY
SAY
A
WORD
HERE
OUT
OF
MY
OWN
ALREADY
ACKNOWLEDGED
BIAS
ONE
COMPLAINT
AGAINST
CRITICAL
METHODOLOGY
IS
THAT
IT
DISSOLVES
FAITH
BUT
SURELY
A
FAITH
THAT
CANNOT
HONESTLY
FACE
THE
EVALU
ATION
OF
EVIDENCE
HAS
PROBLEMS
WHICH
MERE
THEOLOGY
IS
HELPLESS
TO
ADDRESS
ANYWAY
THERE
IS
A
SERIOUS
AND
UNFORTUNATE
POSSIBILITY
OF
SCHISM
BETWEEN
LIBERAL
AND
CONSERVATIVE
POSITIONS
MOSTLY
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
EXTREME
ZEALOTS
OF
POSITIONS
B
AND
C
A
CATHOLIC
SENSE
OF
AUTHORITY
AND
TRADITION
TENDS
TO
CONSTRAIN
ARGUMENTS
OF
B
CONTRA
C
TO
SECONDARY
POSITION
SO
THAT
DESPITE
HORRENDOUS
STRAINS
ROME
IS
NOT
AS
LIKELY
TO
FIND
THESE
ISSUES
AS
ULTIMATELY
DIVISIVE
AS
THE
PROTESTANT
WORLD
WILL
AND
ANGLICANS
WILL
I
PREDICT
MUDDLE
THROUGH
ON
THE
VIA
MEDIA
ATTEMPTING
TO
GIVE
EACH
POSITION
ITS
DUE
BUT
NO
MORE
THAN
ITS
DUE
SECOND
QUESTION
SUPPOSE
TRADITION
TELLS
US
AND
LOTS
OF
SPIRITUAL
CHRISTIANS
TELL
US
AND
CRITICAL
THOUGHT
AT
LEAST
ADMITS
AS
POSSIBLE
THAT
PAUL
IS
REFERING
TO
A
FLAT
UNIVERSAL
LEVITICAL
PROHIBITION
AGAINST
MALEMALE
SEX
WHAT
THEN
AGAIN
WE
CAN
ABDICATE
OUR
PERSONAL
RESPONSI
BILITY
TO
TRADITION
AND
LET
IT
DICTATE
THE
ANSWER
BUT
ITS
PRECISELY
WHERE
INHERITED
TRADITIONS
ARE
NOT
QUESTIONED
THAT
THEYRE
MOST
DANGEROUS
WE
HAVE
EXAMPLES
OF
CHRIST
QUESTIONING
THE
PHARISEES
AND
THEIR
USE
OF
TRADITION
DESPITE
HIS
URGING
IN
MATTHEW
THAT
WE
ARE
TO
HEED
THEM
WE
HAVE
EXAMPLES
OF
PETER
AND
MORE
RADICALLY
STILL
PAUL
JETTISONING
THE
TRADITIONS
THAT
THEY
WERE
LED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
TO
CALL
INTO
QUESTION
JESUS
AND
PETER
AND
PAUL
DO
NOT
SO
MUCH
THROW
OUT
TRADITION
AS
SUBJECT
IT
TO
RADICAL
CRITICISM
ON
A
COUPLE
OF
VERY
BASIC
GROUNDS
THE
WEIGHTIER
DEMANDS
OF
THE
LAW
JUSTICE
AND
MERCY
AND
GOOD
FAITH
MATTHEW
AND
ON
THESE
TWO
COMMANDMENTS
LOVE
GOD
NEIGHBOR
HAND
THE
WHOLE
LAW
AND
THE
PROPHETS
ALSO
MATTHEW
IF
THERE
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
BECAUSE
DERIVED
FROM
CHRIST
VALIDITY
IN
THE
CHALLENGE
TO
SOME
TRADITIONS
A
VALIDITY
THAT
LED
THE
FIRST
GENERATION
TO
GO
SO
FAR
AS
TO
WAIVE
APPLICATION
OF
THE
TORAH
TO
GENTILE
CONVERTS
VASTLY
BEYOND
ANYTHING
THAT
IS
DIRECTLY
DEDUCIBLE
FROM
JESUS
REPORTED
WORDS
AND
DEEDS
IT
SIGNIFIES
TO
ME
A
CERTAIN
FAILURE
OF
THE
IMAGINATION
TO
POSTULATE
THAT
ONLY
THE
TRADITIONS
THAT
WE
HAVE
SPECIFIC
CHALLENGES
AGAINST
ARE
IN
FACT
OPEN
TO
CHALLENGE
ALL
TRADITIONS
PASSED
THROUGH
MEN
ARE
TRADITIONS
OF
MEN
THAT
GOD
MAY
LEAD
US
EVEN
SO
THAT
THESE
TRADITIONS
ARE
A
SOURCE
OF
OUR
SPIRITUAL
INSTRUCTION
I
WILL
FREELY
GRANT
BUT
TRADITION
IS
INHERENTLY
HUMAN
AND
INHERENTLY
CORRUPTIBLE
AND
GIVEN
THE
FALL
CORRUPT
NOTHING
IN
IT
IS
IMMUNE
TO
CHALLENGE
WHEN
THE
SPIRIT
SHOWS
US
A
FAILURE
IN
JUSTICE
MERCY
AND
GOOD
FAITH
NOTHING
MAY
ULTIMATELY
STAND
UNLESS
IT
DOES
FOLLOW
FROM
LOVE
OF
GOD
AND
LOVE
OF
NEIGHBOR
I
AM
PERFECTLY
WILLING
TO
GRANT
THAT
I
COULD
BE
BLIND
TO
MY
OWN
SIN
THAT
THE
SPIRIT
MAY
HAVE
TAUGHT
ANOTHER
WHAT
SHE
REFUSES
TO
TEACH
ME
OR
I
AM
TOO
DENSE
TO
LEARN
THAT
TRADITION
MIGHT
HAVE
VALUE
HERE
BUT
WHAT
I
KNOW
OF
TRADITION
IS
THAT
ON
ONE
OCCASION
SOME
SUPERSTITIOUS
CHRISTIANS
APPEALED
TO
JUSTINIAN
AFTER
AN
EARTHQUAKE
IN
ASIA
MINOR
AND
SCAPEGOATED
SODOMITES
AS
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
EARTHQUAKE
SO
THAT
LEGISLATION
WAS
PASSED
MAKING
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
A
CAPITAL
OFFENSE
IF
THAT
IS
IN
ACCORD
WITH
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
THEN
I
AM
NO
CHRISTIAN
THAT
IS
HUMAN
TRADITION
AT
ITS
MOST
HATEFUL
AND
VICIOUS
AND
I
SEE
NOTHING
ALL
THAT
MUCH
DIFFERENT
IN
ALL
THE
UNBIDDEN
ERUPTIONS
ONTO
USENET
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
QUICK
TO
CONDEMN
BUT
SLOW
TO
UNDERSTAND
IF
THAT
IS
THE
LEADING
OF
THE
SPIRIT
THEN
I
WANT
NO
PART
OF
IT
BUT
WHAT
I
HAVE
FOUND
IN
OBEDIENCE
TO
THE
LORD
IS
THAT
I
AM
MYSELF
TOTALLY
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
WITNESS
OF
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
FOR
THE
TRUTH
THAT
LIVES
IN
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
AND
I
SAY
TO
ALL
WHO
DOUBT
THAT
GAY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
FROM
GOD
WHAT
GAMALIEL
SAID
TO
DOUBTING
PHARISEES
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
SUPPRESSED
THE
EARLIEST
CHURCH
BE
CAREFUL
HOW
YOU
DEAL
WITH
THESE
PEOPLE
IF
THIS
ENTERPRISE
THIS
MOVEMENT
OF
THEIRS
IS
OF
HUMAN
ORIGIN
IT
WILL
BREAK
UP
OF
ITS
OWN
ACCORD
BUT
IF
IT
DOES
IN
FACT
COME
FROM
GOD
YOU
WILL
NOT
ONLY
BE
UNABLE
TO
DESTROY
THEM
BUT
YOU
MIGHT
FIND
YOURSELVES
FIGHTING
AGAINST
GOD
ACTS
ALL
I
ASK
IS
THAT
YOU
LISTEN
TO
YOUR
TRADITIONS
AND
READ
YOUR
SCRIPTURES
WITH
A
MIND
AND
SOUL
OPEN
TO
THE
SPIRIT
AND
TO
THE
PAST
HISTORY
OF
OUR
FIRST
CHRISTIAN
WITNESSES
WILLINGNESS
TO
CHALLENGE
TRADITION
AND
OTHER
READINGS
OF
SCRIPTURE
THOUGH
READ
WITH
ALL
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
SCRIBES
AND
RABBIS
AND
A
SUBMISSION
TO
THE
DECLARATION
THAT
ALL
MUST
DEPEND
ON
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
AND
NEIGHBOR
THEN
STUDY
THE
EVIDENCE
LEARN
THE
HISTORY
OF
CHRISTIANS
OPPRESSING
CHRISTIANS
OUT
OF
THEIR
TRADITIONS
AND
EAGERNESS
TO
JUDGE
WHERE
JESUS
AND
PAUL
TELL
US
NOT
TO
JUDGE
AND
LET
THE
WITNESS
OF
THE
SPIRIT
IN
THE
LIVES
OF
YOUR
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
INCLUDING
THOSE
WHO
ARE
NOT
OF
YOUR
PREFERENCE
IN
THEOLOGY
GUIDE
YOU
TOWARDS
GODS
TRUTH
MICHAEL
L
SIEMON
I
SAY
YOU
ARE
GODS
SONS
OF
THE
MLSPANIXCOM
MOST
HIGH
ALL
OF
YOU
NEVERTHELESS
OR
YOU
SHALL
DIE
LIKE
MEN
AND
FALL
MLSULYSSESATTCOM
LIKE
ANY
PRINCE
PSALM
THERES
A
CERTAIN
AMBIGUITY
IN
YOUR
DISCUSSION
OF
POSITION
A
AS
TO
WHETHER
YOURE
SPEAKING
OF
TRADITION
IN
PAULS
TIME
OR
OURS
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
TWO
WAYS
TO
USE
TRADITION
ONE
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
WHEN
PAUL
AND
HIS
READERS
SHARE
A
TRADITION
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
INTERPRET
HIS
WORDS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THAT
SHARED
TRADITION
THATS
WHAT
MAKES
ME
THINK
THAT
THESE
ARGUMENTS
OVER
WORDS
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
SILLY
WE
KNOW
THAT
PAUL
CAME
OUT
OF
A
BACKGROUND
THAT
WAS
RATHER
PURITANICAL
ON
SEX
EVERYTHING
ELSE
HE
SAYS
ON
SEX
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
THAT
BACKGROUND
THE
TONE
OF
HIS
REMARKS
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
ROM
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
THAT
BACKGROUND
EVEN
IF
THE
WORDS
IN
THE
SIN
LISTS
ARENT
THE
MOST
GENERAL
TERMS
FOR
HOMOSEXUAL
ACTIVITY
AND
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THERES
SOME
EVIDENCE
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
THEY
ARE
JUST
ONE
MORE
PIECE
OF
EVIDENCE
FOR
SOMETHING
WE
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
WILLING
TO
BELIEVE
WITH
NO
EVIDENCE
AT
ALL
THAT
PAUL
SHARES
THE
COMMON
JEWISH
REJECTION
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
WHEN
YOU
IDENTIFY
A
WITH
THE
CATHOLIC
POSITION
THATS
RATHER
A
HORSE
OF
A
DIFFERENT
COLOR
THE
CATHOLIC
POSITION
INVOLVES
A
CONTINUING
CHURCH
TRADITION
ARGUMENTS
SPECIFIC
TO
THAT
TRADITION
MIGHT
BE
WE
CAN
GET
GUIDANCE
ON
HOW
TO
INTERPRET
PAULS
ORIGINAL
MEANING
FROM
TRADITION
EG
THE
WAY
THE
CHURCH
FATHERS
INTERPRETED
HIM
AND
WE
GAIN
CONFIDENCE
THAT
HIS
PROHIBITIONS
STILL
APPLY
IN
OUR
TIME
BECAUSE
OF
THE
UNIVERSAL
JUDGEMENT
OF
THE
CHURCH
BETWEEN
HIS
TIME
AND
OURS
I
THINK
THIS
IS
A
SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENT
USE
OF
TRADITION
A
RADICAL
PROTESTANT
MIGHT
BE
WILLING
TO
USE
KNOWN
CENT
TRADITION
TO
ILLUMINATE
PAULS
ORIGINAL
MEANING
BUT
NOT
USE
THE
CATHOLIC
POSITION
TO
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
OUR
OWN
ATTITUDE
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
SHOULD
BE
CLH
