OK
WHATS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
GAY
CHRISTIANS
SEX
OR
CHRISTIANITY
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
HOPE
WOULD
THEY
BE
WILLING
TO
FORGO
SEX
COMPLETELY
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
BEING
A
STUMBLING
BLOCK
TO
OTHERS
TO
AVOID
THE
CHANCE
THAT
THEIR
INTERPRETATION
MIGHT
BE
WRONG
ETC
IF
NOT
WHY
NOT
HETEROSEXUALS
ABSTAIN
ALL
THE
TIME
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
PROTESTANT
CHURCHES
HAD
CELIBATE
ORDERS
TO
SHOW
THE
WORLD
THAT
SEX
IS
NOT
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
IN
LIFE
THE
BIBLICAL
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALITY
ARE
WEAK
AT
BEST
YET
CHRIST
IS
QUITE
CLEAR
ABOUT
OUR
OBLIGATIONS
TO
THE
POOR
HOW
AS
CHRISTIANS
CAN
WE
DEMAND
CELIBACY
FROM
HOMOSEXUALS
WHEN
WE
WALK
BY
HOMELESS
PEOPLE
AND
IGNORE
THE
PLEAS
FOR
HELP
CHRIST
IS
QUITE
CLEAR
ON
OUR
OBLIGATIONS
TO
THE
POOR
THOUGHT
FOR
THE
DAY
MAT
AND
WHY
BEHOLDEST
THOU
THE
MOTE
THAT
IS
IN
THY
BROTHERS
EYE
BUT
CONSIDEREST
NOT
THE
BEAM
THAT
IS
IN
THINE
OWN
EYE
OR
HOW
WILT
THOU
SAY
TO
THY
BROTHER
LET
ME
PULL
OUT
THE
MOTE
OUT
OF
THINE
EYE
AND
BEHOLD
A
BEAM
IS
IN
THINE
OWN
EYE
THE
LOVE
OF
CHRIST
IS
CONTAGIOUS
MAT
WOE
UNTO
YOU
SCRIBES
AND
PHARISEES
HYPOCRITES
FOR
YE
ARE
LIKE
UNTO
WHITED
SEPULCHRES
WHICH
INDEED
APPEAR
BEAUTIFUL
OUTWARD
BUT
ARE
WITHIN
FULL
OF
DEAD
MENS
BONES
AND
OF
ALL
UNCLEANNESS
