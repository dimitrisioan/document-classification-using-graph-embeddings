CHRISTIANITY
ATHEISM
AN
UPDATE
FIRST
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
THANK
ALL
WHO
SENT
ME
THEIR
OPINIONS
ON
THE
MATTER
AT
HAND
ALL
ADVICE
WAS
TAKEN
TO
HEART
IF
NOT
DIRECTLY
USED
MY
FRIEND
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
THE
MATTER
QUITE
ACCIDENTLY
AFTER
READING
SOME
OF
MY
MAIL
I
QUIT
FROM
THE
MAIL
READER
WENT
ABOUT
MY
BUSINESS
I
MUST
HAVE
TRASHED
MY
MAIL
IMPROPERLY
BECAUSE
HE
GOT
ON
THE
SAME
TERMINAL
THE
NEXT
DAY
SAW
MY
OLD
MESSAGES
HE
THOUGHT
THEY
WERE
RESPONSES
TO
A
POST
HE
PLACED
IN
ALTATHEISM
EARLIER
THAT
WEEK
SO
HE
READ
SOME
OF
THEM
BEFORE
REALIZING
THAT
THEY
WERE
FOR
ME
I
GOT
A
MESSAGE
FROM
HIM
THE
NEXT
DAY
HE
APOLOGIZED
FOR
READING
MY
MAIL
SAID
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
SNOOP
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
TALK
TO
ME
ABOUT
HIS
VIEWS
DIDNT
MIND
DOING
SO
ESPECIALLY
WITH
A
FRIEND
SO
WE
DID
I
NEITHER
CHANGED
HIS
MIND
NOR
DID
HE
CHANGE
MINE
AS
THAT
WAS
NOT
THE
POINT
NOW
HE
KNOWS
WHERE
IM
COMING
FROM
NOW
I
KNOW
WHERE
HES
COMING
FROM
AND
ALL
THAT
I
CAN
DO
IS
PRAY
FOR
HIM
AS
IVE
ALWAYS
DONE
I
BELIEVE
THE
REASON
THAT
HE
I
CLICK
INSTEAD
OF
BASH
HEADS
IS
BECAUSE
I
SEE
CHRISTIANITY
AS
A
TOOL
FOR
REVOLUTION
NOT
A
TOOL
FOR
MAINTAINING
THE
STATUS
QUO
TO
BE
QUITE
BLUNT
I
HAVE
MORE
OF
A
REASON
TO
REJECT
GOD
THAN
HE
DOES
JUST
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
I
AM
AN
AFRICANAMERICAN
FEMALE
CHRISTIANITY
RELIGION
HAVE
BEEN
USED
AS
TOOLS
TO
SEPARATE
MY
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
TRUE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
OUR
HISTORY
THE
WEALTH
OF
OUR
CONTRIBUTIONS
TO
THE
WORLD
SOCIETY
THE
KITCHEN
OF
HEAVEN
WAS
ALL
WE
HAD
TO
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
DURING
THE
SLAVE
DAYS
THIS
MENTALITY
SECONDCLASS
STATUS
STILL
EXISTS
TODAY
I
TOO
HAVE
REJECTED
AN
ASPECT
OF
CHRISTIANITYTHAT
OF
THE
ESTABISHED
CHURCH
TOO
MUCH
HYPOCRICY
EXISTS
BEHIND
THE
WALLS
OF
GODS
HOUSE
BEGINNING
WITH
THE
IMAGES
OF
A
WHITE
JESUS
TO
THAT
OF
THE
MEMBERS
PRAISE
GOD
ON
SUNDAY
RAISE
HELL
BEGINNING
MONDAY
GODWILLING
I
WILL
FIND
A
CHURCH
HOME
WHERE
I
CAN
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
ATHOME
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
IT
HAPPENING
ANYTIME
SOON
