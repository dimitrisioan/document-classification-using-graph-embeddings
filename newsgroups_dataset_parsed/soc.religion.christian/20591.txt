RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ARTICLE
MHSULONESTARUTSAEDU
MELINDA
HSU
WRITES
BELIEF
THAT
THEIR
FAITH
IS
TOTAL
TRUTH
ACCORDING
TO
THEM
THEIR
BELIEFS
COME
FROM
THE
BIBLE
AND
THE
BIBLE
IS
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
GOD
IS
TRUTH
THUS
THEY
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
THIS
STANCE
MAKES
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
DISCUSS
OTHER
FAITHS
WITH
THEM
AND
MY
OWN
HESITATIONS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
BECAUSE
THEY
SEE
NO
OTHER
WAY
THEIR
WAY
IS
THE
TRUTH
BUT
I
SEE
THEIR
FAITH
ARISING
FROM
A
WILLFUL
CHOICE
TO
BELIEVE
A
PARTICULAR
WAY
THAT
CHOICE
IS
PART
FAITH
AND
PART
REASON
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
A
CHOICE
MY
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
SOME
CHRISTIANS
REMIND
ME
OF
SCHOOLYARD
DISCUSSIONS
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
GRADE
SCHOOL
A
KID
WOULD
SAY
ALL
POLICEMEN
ARE
JERKS
ID
ASK
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
BECAUSE
MY
DADDY
TOLD
ME
SO
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
YOURE
DADDY
IS
RIGHT
HE
SAYS
HES
ALWAYS
RIGHT
WELL
THE
ARGUMENT
USUALLY
STOPS
RIGHT
THERE
IN
THE
END
ARENT
WE
ALL
JUST
KIDS
GROPING
FOR
THE
TRUTH
IF
SO
DO
WE
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
DECLARE
ALL
OTHER
BELIEFS
BESIDES
OUR
OWN
AS
FALSE
I
FIND
THIS
ARGUMENT
VERY
STRANGE
THOUGH
NOT
UNFAMILIAR
AN
ANALOGY
SOMEONE
USED
A
WHILE
BACK
CAN
PERHAPS
ILLUSTRATE
IT
SAY
FOR
EXAMPLE
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
LIVING
ON
A
VOLCANIC
ISLAND
AND
A
GROUP
OF
GEOLOGISTS
DETERMINE
THAT
A
VOLCANO
IS
IMMINENT
THEY
WARN
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
ISLAND
THAT
THEY
ARE
IN
DANGER
AND
SHOULD
LEAVE
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
ON
THE
ISLAND
IS
GIVEN
THE
TASK
OF
WARNING
OTHERS
OF
THE
DANGER
THEY
BELIEVE
THE
DANGER
IS
REAL
BUT
OTHERS
MAY
NOT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
THE
FIRST
GROUP
ARE
NECESSARILY
ARROGANT
IN
WARNING
OTHERS
OF
THE
DANGER
DOES
IT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
ARE
SAYING
THAT
THEIR
BELIEFS
ARE
CORRECT
AND
ALL
OTHERS
ARE
FALSE
SOME
MIGHT
INDEED
REACT
TO
OPPOSITION
WITH
ARROGANCE
AND
BEHAVE
IN
AN
ARROGANT
MANNER
BUT
THAT
IS
A
PERSONAL
IDIOCYNCRACY
IT
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
THAT
THEY
ARE
ALL
ARROGANT
