RE
NATIONAL
REPENTANCE
MICHAEL
COVINGTON
WRITES
I
HEARD
ON
THE
RADIO
TODAY
ABOUT
A
CHRISTIAN
STUDENT
CONFERENCE
WHERE
CHRISTIANS
WERE
CALLED
TO
REPENT
OF
AMERICAS
NATIONAL
SINS
SUCH
AS
SEXUAL
PROMISCUITY
HOW
CAN
I
REPENT
OF
SOMEONE
ELSES
SIN
I
CANT
AND
WHEN
I
CLAIM
TO
REPENT
OF
SOMEONE
ELSES
SIN
AM
I
NOT
IN
FACT
JUDGING
HIM
JESUS
EQUIPPED
US
TO
JUDGE
ACTIVITIES
BUT
WARNED
US
NOT
TO
JUDGE
PEOPLE
JUDGE
NOT
THAT
YE
BE
NOT
JUDGED
STRICTLY
SPEAKING
YOURE
RIGHT
WE
CANT
REPENT
FOR
SOMEBODY
ELSE
FOR
WHAT
THEYVE
DONE
I
GUESS
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
OUT
OF
LINE
TO
TALK
ABOUT
A
GENERALIZED
REPENTENCE
FOR
OUR
CONTRIBUTION
TO
OR
PARTICIPATION
IN
THE
SINS
OF
SOCIETY
OR
FOR
OUR
TACIT
APPROVAL
BY
OUR
SILENCE
OF
SINFUL
ATTITUDES
OR
PRACTICESIT
MAY
BE
THAT
WERE
ALSO
JUST
PLAIN
BEGGING
FOR
MERCY
HOPING
GOD
WILL
WITHHOLD
HIS
HAND
OF
JUDGEMENT
ON
OUR
WHOLE
COUNTRY
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
A
FEW
MUCH
AS
ABRAHAM
SOUGHT
TO
DO
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
LOT
HMMM
THE
RESULTS
THERE
WERE
PRETTY
CAUTIONARY
A
FEW
TIMES
LATELY
WHEN
IVE
OBSERVED
SOME
EITHER
OUTANDOUT
SINFUL
ACTIVITY
OR
JUST
SOME
SELFDESTRUCTIVE
ACTIVITY
IVE
GOTTEN
A
STRONG
IMPRESSION
THAT
MANY
FOLKS
REALLY
DONT
KNOW
ANY
BETTER
CHRISTS
PITY
ON
THE
CROWDS
AS
BEING
LIKE
SHEEP
WITHOUT
A
SHEPHERD
RINGS
TRUE
TO
ME
IF
THESE
FOLKS
DONT
HAVE
A
CLUE
DO
I
BEAR
ANY
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
MY
NOT
HAVING
COMMUNICATED
A
BETTER
WAY
WORSE
STILL
HAVE
I
EXPRESSED
JUDGEMENT
AND
DISGUST
AT
THEIR
DOINGS
AND
THUS
ALIENATED
THEM
FROM
ANY
POSITIVE
RELATIONSHIP
WHEREBY
I
MIGHT
PASS
ALONG
ANYTHING
POSITIVE
I
KNOW
IVE
GOT
SOMETHING
TO
REPENT
ABOUT
ON
THAT
SCORE
ANYWAY
ITS
A
REAL
INTERESTING
QUESTION
