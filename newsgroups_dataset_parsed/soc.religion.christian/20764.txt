RE
HELP
IM
A
COMMITED
CHRISTIAN
THAT
IS
BATTLING
WITH
A
PROBLEM
I
KNOW
THAT
ROMANS
TALKS
ABOUT
HOW
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
OUR
FAITH
NOT
OUR
DEEDS
YET
HEBREWS
AND
JAMES
SAY
THAT
FAITH
WITHOUT
DEEDS
IS
USELESS
SAYING
YOU
FOOLS
DO
YOU
STILL
THINK
THAT
JUST
BELIEVING
IS
ENOUGH
STUFF
DELETED
NOW
I
AM
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
YOU
A
SAVED
THROUGH
FAITH
ALONE
NOT
WHAT
YOU
DO
AS
TAUGHT
IN
ROMANS
BUT
HOW
CAN
I
SQUARE
UP
IN
MY
MIND
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
JAMES
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
THE
LUKEWARM
CHRISTIAN
BEING
SPATOUT
CAN
ANYONE
HELP
ME
THIS
REALLY
BOTHERS
ME
WILL
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
LOT
OF
DISCUSSION
GOING
ON
ABOUT
THIS
OVER
IN
SRCBS
I
WILL
MAKE
THE
CASE
HERE
THOUGH
AND
TRY
TO
HELP
YOU
OUT
FOR
BY
GRACE
ARE
YE
SAVED
THROUGH
FAITH
AND
THAT
NOT
OF
YOURSELVES
IT
IS
THE
GIFT
OF
GOD
NOT
OF
WORKS
LEST
ANY
MAN
SHOULD
BOAST
EPHESIANS
YES
IT
IS
BY
GODS
GRACE
AND
OUR
FAITH
THAT
WE
ARE
SAVED
WE
ARE
NOT
SAVED
BY
WHAT
WE
DO
HOWEVER
IF
YE
LOVE
ME
KEEP
MY
COMMANDMENTS
JOHN
KEEPING
CHRISTS
COMMANDMENTS
IS
A
WORK
PER
SE
AND
A
DEMONSTRATION
OF
OUR
LOVE
FOR
HIM
ALSO
HE
SPAKE
ALSO
THIS
PARABLE
A
CERTAIN
MAN
HAD
A
FIG
TREE
PLANTED
IN
HIS
VINEYARD
AND
HE
CAME
AND
SOUGHT
FRUIT
THEREON
AND
FOUND
NONE
THEN
SAID
HE
UNTO
THE
DRESSER
OF
HIS
VINEYARD
BEHOLD
THESE
THREE
YEARS
I
COME
SEEKING
FRUIT
ON
THIS
FIG
TREE
AND
FIND
NONE
CUT
IT
DOWN
WHY
CUMBERETH
IT
THE
GROUND
AND
HE
ANSWERING
SAID
UNTO
HIM
LORD
LET
IT
ALONE
THIS
YEAR
ALSO
TILL
I
SHALL
DIG
ABOUT
IT
AND
DUNG
IT
AND
IF
IT
BEAR
FRUIT
WELL
AND
IF
NOT
THEN
AFTER
THAT
THOU
SHALT
CUT
IT
DOWN
LUKE
AGAIN
YE
HAVE
NOT
CHOSEN
ME
BUT
I
HAVE
CHOSEN
YOU
AND
ORDAINED
YOU
THAT
YE
SHOULD
GO
AND
BRING
FORTH
FRUIT
AND
THAT
YOUR
FRUIT
SHOULD
REMAIN
THAT
WHATSOEVER
YE
SHALL
ASK
OF
THE
FATHER
IN
MY
NAME
HE
MAY
GIVE
IT
YOU
JOHN
IT
IS
CLEAR
FROM
THESE
VERSES
THAT
WE
ARE
CALLED
TO
BRING
FORTH
FRUIT
WHAT
IS
THAT
FRUIT
WELL
PAUL
SPEAKS
OF
THE
FRUIT
OF
THE
SPIRIT
BEING
LOVE
JOY
PEACE
PATIENCE
ETC
ALL
OF
THESE
ARE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
MANIFEST
IN
THE
ACTIONS
THAT
WE
CARRY
OUT
IF
A
PERSON
CLAIMS
TO
BELIEVE
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
BUT
DOES
NOT
DO
THE
THINGS
CHRIST
COMMANDED
I
DARE
SAY
THAT
THEY
REALLY
DONT
HAVE
ANY
FAITH
ASKING
WHICH
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
FAITH
OR
WORKS
IS
LIKE
ASKING
WHICH
BLADE
ON
A
PAIR
OF
SCISSORS
IS
MOST
IMPORTANT
OR
LIKE
ASKING
WHICH
LEG
OF
YOUR
PANTS
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
GOOD
WORKS
SHOULD
COME
OUT
OF
AND
BE
A
RESULT
OF
OUR
FAITH
TO
HAVE
FAITH
TRUE
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
REQUIRES
YOU
TO
DO
WHAT
HE
COMMANDS
THE
PARABLE
ABOVE
SPEAKS
ALLEGORICALLY
OF
A
PERSON
WHO
DOES
BEAR
NO
FRUIT
CHRISTS
COMMANDS
ARE
ACTIONS
AND
IF
WE
DONT
DO
THOSE
ACTIONS
AND
PRODUCE
FRUIT
THEN
WE
SHALL
BE
UPROOTED
JUST
LIKE
THE
TREE
IT
IS
A
DEAD
AND
USELESS
FAITH
WHICH
HAS
NO
ACTION
BEHIND
IT
ACTIONS
PROVE
OUR
FAITH
AND
SHOW
THE
GENUINENESS
OF
IT
I
CAN
SIT
AND
TALK
FOR
DAYS
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
I
HAVE
SO
MUCH
FAITH
IN
MY
ABILITY
TO
JUMP
OFF
A
BUILDING
AND
NOT
HIT
THE
GROUND
IN
OTHER
WORDS
I
CAN
SIT
AND
TELL
YOU
ALL
DAY
LONG
THAT
I
HAVE
FAITH
IN
MY
ABILITY
TO
FLY
I
REALLY
DONT
HAVE
THAT
FAITH
THOUGH
UNLESS
I
AM
WILLING
TO
JUMP
OFF
THE
ROOF
AND
TAKE
THE
TEST
WORDS
AND
TALK
MEAN
NOTHING
I
COULD
GO
ON
AND
GIVE
MORE
SCRIPTURES
AND
IF
PEOPLE
WANT
ME
TO
I
WILL
BUT
THIS
SHOULD
BE
SUFFICIENT
HOPE
IT
HELPED
