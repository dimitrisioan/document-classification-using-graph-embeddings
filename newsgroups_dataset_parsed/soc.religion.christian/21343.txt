RE
MONOPHYSITES
AND
MIKE
WALKER
HELLO
SRC
READERS
AGAIN
THE
MISCONCEPTION
THAT
COPTS
AMONG
OTHER
ORIENTAL
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
BELIEVE
IN
MONOPHYSITISM
POPS
UP
AGAIN
WE
HAD
A
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
IT
A
WHILE
AGO
IN
ARTICLE
D
ANDREW
BYLER
WRITES
THE
PROPER
TERM
FOR
WHAT
MIKE
EXPRESSES
IS
MONOPHYSITISM
THIS
WAS
A
HERESY
THAT
WAS
CONDEMNED
IN
THE
COUNCIL
OF
CHALCEDON
IN
AD
IT
GREW
UP
IN
REACTION
TO
NESTORIANISM
WHICH
HELD
THAT
THE
SON
AND
JESUS
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
BE
UNITED
IN
THE
SAME
BODY
TEMPORARILY
MONOPHYSITISM
IS
HELD
BY
THE
COPTS
OF
EGYPT
AND
ETHIPOIA
AND
BY
THE
JACOBITES
OF
SYRIA
AND
THE
ARMENIAN
ORTHODOX
THEN
OFM
COMMENTS
THESE
ISSUES
GET
MIGHTY
SUBTLE
WHEN
YOU
SEE
PEOPLE
SAYING
DIFFERENT
THINGS
ITS
OFTEN
HARD
TO
TELL
WHETHER
THEY
REALLY
MEAN
SERIOUSLY
DIFFERENT
THINGS
OR
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
USING
DIFFERENT
TERMINOLOGY
I
DONT
THINK
THERES
ANY
QUESTION
THAT
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
NESTORIUS
AND
I
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
THE
SAYING
CHRIST
HAD
A
HUMAN
FORM
WITHOUT
A
REAL
HUMAN
NATURE
OR
WILL
IS
HERETICAL
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
A
BIT
WARY
ABOUT
THE
COPTS
ARMENIANS
ETC
RECENT
DISCUSSIONS
SUGGEST
THAT
THEIR
MONOPHYSITE
POSITION
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
FAR
FROM
ORTHODOXY
AS
MANY
HAD
THOUGHT
WITH
MY
APPRECIATION
TO
THE
MODERATOR
I
BELIEVE
THAT
FURTHER
ELABORATION
IS
NEEDED
THIS
IS
AN
EXCERPT
FROM
AN
ARTICLE
FEATURED
IN
THE
FIRST
ISSUE
OF
THE
COPTNET
NEWSLETTER
UNDER
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
EASTERN
ROMAN
EMPIRE
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
WESTERN
EMPIRE
OF
ROME
THE
PATRIARCHS
AND
POPES
OF
ALEXANDRIA
PLAYED
LEADING
ROLES
IN
CHRISTIAN
THEOLOGY
THEY
WERE
INVITED
EVERYWHERE
TO
SPEAK
ABOUT
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
ST
CYRIL
POPE
OF
ALEXANDRIA
WAS
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
ECUMENICAL
COUNCIL
WHICH
WAS
HELD
IN
EPHESUS
IN
THE
YEAR
AD
IT
WAS
SAID
THAT
THE
BISHOPS
OF
THE
CHURCH
OF
ALEXANDRIA
DID
NOTHING
BUT
SPEND
ALL
THEIR
TIME
IN
MEETINGS
THIS
LEADING
ROLE
HOWEVER
DID
NOT
FARE
WELL
WHEN
POLITICS
STARTED
TO
INTERMINGLE
WITH
CHURCH
AFFAIRS
IT
ALL
STARTED
WHEN
THE
EMPEROR
MARCIANUS
INTERFERED
WITH
MATTERS
OF
FAITH
IN
THE
CHURCH
THE
RESPONSE
OF
ST
DIOSCORUS
THE
POPE
OF
ALEXANDRIA
WHO
WAS
LATER
EXILED
TO
THIS
INTERFERENCE
WAS
CLEAR
YOU
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
CHURCH
THESE
POLITICAL
MOTIVES
BECAME
EVEN
MORE
APPARENT
IN
CHALCEDON
IN
WHEN
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
WAS
UNFAIRLY
ACCUSED
OF
FOLLOWING
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
EUTYCHES
WHO
BELIEVED
IN
MONOPHYSITISM
THIS
DOCTRINE
MAINTAINS
THAT
THE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
HAS
ONLY
ONE
NATURE
THE
DIVINE
NOT
TWO
NATURES
THE
HUMAN
AS
WELL
AS
THE
DIVINE
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
HAS
NEVER
BELIEVED
IN
MONOPHYSITISM
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
PORTRAYED
IN
THE
COUNCIL
OF
CHALCEDON
IN
THAT
COUNCIL
MONOPHYSITISM
MEANT
BELIEVING
IN
ONE
NATURE
COPTS
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
LORD
IS
PERFECT
IN
HIS
DIVINITY
AND
HE
IS
PERFECT
IN
HIS
HUMANITY
BUT
HIS
DIVINITY
AND
HIS
HUMANITY
WERE
UNITED
IN
ONE
NATURE
CALLED
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
INCARNATE
WORD
WHICH
WAS
REITERATED
BY
ST
CYRIL
OF
ALEXANDRIA
COPTS
THUS
BELIEVE
IN
TWO
NATURES
HUMAN
AND
DIVINE
THAT
ARE
UNITED
IN
ONE
WITHOUT
MINGLING
WITHOUT
CONFUSION
AND
WITHOUT
ALTERATION
FROM
THE
DECLARATION
OF
FAITH
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
COPTIC
DIVINE
LITURGY
THESE
TWO
NATURES
DID
NOT
SEPARATE
FOR
A
MOMENT
OR
THE
TWINKLING
OF
AN
EYE
ALSO
FROM
THE
DECLARATION
OF
FAITH
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
COPTIC
DIVINE
LITURGY
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
WAS
MISUNDERSTOOD
IN
THE
CENTURY
AT
THE
COUNCIL
OF
CHALCEDON
PERHAPS
THE
COUNCIL
UNDERSTOOD
THE
CHURCH
CORRECTLY
BUT
THEY
WANTED
TO
EXILE
THE
CHURCH
TO
ISOLATE
IT
AND
TO
ABOLISH
THE
EGYPTIAN
INDEPENDENT
POPE
DESPITE
ALL
OF
THIS
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
HAS
REMAINED
VERY
STRICT
AND
STEADFAST
IN
ITS
FAITH
WHETHER
IT
WAS
A
CONSPIRACY
FROM
THE
WESTERN
CHURCHES
TO
EXILE
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
AS
A
PUNISHMENT
FOR
ITS
REFUSAL
TO
BE
POLITICALLY
INFLUENCED
OR
WHETHER
POPE
DIOSCURUS
DIDNT
QUITE
GO
THE
EXTRA
MILE
TO
MAKE
THE
POINT
THAT
COPTS
ARE
NOT
MONOPHYSITE
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
HAS
ALWAYS
FELT
A
MANDATE
TO
RECONCILE
SEMANTIC
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
ALL
CHRISTIAN
CHURCHES
THIS
IS
APTLY
EXPRESSED
BY
THE
CURRENT
SUCCESSOR
OF
ST
MARK
POPE
SHENOUDA
III
TO
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
FAITH
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
ANYTHING
AND
OTHERS
MUST
KNOW
THAT
SEMANTICS
AND
TERMINOLOGY
ARE
OF
LITTLE
IMPORTANCE
TO
US
THROUGHOUT
THIS
CENTURY
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
HAS
PLAYED
AN
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
THE
ECUMENICAL
MOVEMENT
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
IS
ONE
OF
THE
FOUNDERS
OF
THE
WORLD
COUNCIL
OF
CHURCHES
IT
HAS
REMAINED
A
MEMBER
OF
THAT
COUNCIL
SINCE
AD
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
IS
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
ALL
AFRICAN
COUNCIL
OF
CHURCHES
AACC
AND
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
COUNCIL
OF
CHURCHES
MECC
THE
CHURCH
PLAYS
AN
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
MOVEMENT
BY
CONDUCTING
DIALOGUES
AIMING
AT
RESOLVING
THE
THEOLOGICAL
DIFFERENCES
WITH
THE
CATHOLIC
GREEK
ORTHODOX
PRESBYTERIAN
AND
EVANGELICAL
CHURCHES
AS
A
FINAL
NOTE
THE
ORIENTAL
ORTHODOX
AND
EASTREN
ORTHODOX
DID
SIGN
A
COMMON
STATEMENT
OF
CHRISTOLOGY
IN
WHICH
THE
HERESEY
OF
MONOPHYSITISM
WAS
CONDEMNED
SO
THE
COPTIC
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
DOES
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
MONOPHYSITISM

AS
I
MENTIONED
IN
A
BRIEF
APOLOGY
THE
COMMENT
QUOTED
ABOVE
FROM
ME
IS
CONFUSED
I
APPEAR
TO
SAY
THAT
NESTORIUS
WAS
MONOPHYSITE
AS
ANDREW
BYLER
CORRECTLY
STATED
IT
THE
NESTORIANS
AND
MONOPHYSITES
WERE
ACTUALLY
OPPOSITE
PARTIES
THE
POINT
I
WAS
MAKING
WHICH
NABIL
EXPLAINS
IN
SOME
DETAIL
IS
THAT
SOME
GROUPS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
CONSIDERED
HERETICAL
PROBABLY
ARENT
CHALCEDON
WAS
A
COMPROMISE
BETWEEN
TWO
GROUPS
THE
ALEXANDRIANS
AND
ANTIOCHENES
IT
ADOPTED
LANGUAGE
THAT
WAS
INTENDED
TO
BE
ACCEPTABLE
TO
MODERATES
IN
BOTH
CAMPS
WHILE
RULING
OUT
THE
EXTREMES
I
AGREE
THAT
THERE
WERE
EXTREMES
THAT
WERE
HERETICAL
HOWEVER
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
COMPLEX
POLITICS
OF
THE
TIME
IT
APPEARS
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
GOT
REJECTED
WHO
DIDNT
INTEND
HERESY
BUT
SIMPLY
USED
LANGUAGE
THAT
WAS
NOT
UNDERSTOOD
OR
EVEN
WAS
MISPRESENTED
AND
SOME
SEEM
NOT
TO
HAVE
JOINTED
IN
THE
COMPROMISE
FOR
REASONS
OTHER
THAN
DOCTRINE
THERE
ARE
GROUPS
DESCENDED
FROM
BOTH
OF
THE
SUPPOSEDLY
HERETICAL
CAMPS
THIS
POSTING
DISCUSSED
THE
DESCENDANTS
OF
THE
ALEXANDRIANS
THERE
ARE
ALSO
A
REMAINING
NESTORIANS
LIKE
SOME
OF
THE
CURRENT
SOCALLED
MONOPHYSITES
THERE
IS
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CURRENT
SOCALLED
NESTORIANS
ARE
NOT
HERETICAL
EITHER
THEY
SHELTERED
NESTORIUS
FROM
WHAT
THEY
SAW
AS
UNFAIR
TREATMENT
BUT
CLAIM
THEY
DID
NOT
ADOPT
HIS
HERESIES
AND
IN
FACT
SEEM
