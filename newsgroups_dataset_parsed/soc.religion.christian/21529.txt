JACOB
AND
ESAU
GERRY
PALO
WROTE
THAT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
EXCLUDES
THE
THEORY
OF
A
SUCCESSION
OF
LIVES
I
WROTE
THAT
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
IN
ROMANS
SPEAKS
OF
GOD
AS
CHOOSING
JACOB
OVER
ESAU
AND
ADDS
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
AS
A
RESULT
OF
ANYTHING
THAT
EITHER
CHILD
HAD
DONE
SINCE
THEY
HAD
NOT
BEEN
BORN
YET
CLEARLY
PAUL
DOES
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
HAD
HAD
PREVIOUS
LIVES
NOR
DOES
HE
SUPPOSE
THAT
HIS
READERS
WILL
BELIEVE
IT
FOR
IF
THEY
HAD
HAD
PREVIOUS
LIVES
IT
WOULD
NOT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
SAY
NEITHER
OF
THEM
HAS
DONE
ANYTHING
GOOD
OR
BAD
AS
YET
SINCE
THEY
ARE
NOT
YET
BORN
DANIEL
COSSACK
WRITES
TO
ASK
WHETHER
IT
IS
FAIR
FOR
GOD
TO
HATE
EASAU
WHEN
ESAU
HAS
DONE
NOTHING
BAD
I
REPLY
THAT
IN
HEBREW
IT
IS
STANDARD
USAGE
TO
SPEAK
OF
HATING
WHEN
WHAT
IS
MEANT
IS
SIMPLY
PUTTING
IN
SECOND
PLACE
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
CONSIDER
THE
SAYING
IN
MATTHEW
NO
MAN
CAN
SERVE
TWO
MASTERS
FOR
EITHER
HE
WILL
HATE
THE
ONE
AND
LOVE
THE
OTHER
OR
NOW
IT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
FALSE
THAT
A
MAN
WITH
TWO
MASTERS
MUST
HATE
ONE
OF
THEM
BUT
IT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
TRUE
THAT
HE
MUST
PUT
ONE
OF
THEM
IN
SECOND
PLACE
A
DOG
THAT
ALWAYS
COMES
WHEN
EITHER
BILLY
OR
BOBBY
CALLS
WILL
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
IF
THEY
STAND
IN
DIFFERENT
PLACES
AND
CALL
SIMULTANEOUSLY
IT
CANNOT
GIVE
FIRST
PRIORITY
TO
BOTH
ONE
MUST
TAKE
SECOND
PLACE
IN
OUR
ORIGINAL
EXAMPLE
SECOND
PLACE
MEANS
THAT
JACOB
NOT
ESAU
IS
CHOSEN
TO
BEAR
THE
COVENANT
BLESSING
AND
OBLIGATION
AND
TO
BE
THE
ANCESTOR
OF
CHRIST
EUGENE
BIGELOW
MENTIONS
MATTHEW
WHICH
SAYS
OF
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
AND
IF
YE
WILL
RECEIVE
IT
THIS
IS
ELIJAH
WHO
WAS
TO
COME
I
TAKE
THIS
TO
MEAN
THAT
JOHN
WAS
AN
ELIJAHLIKE
FIGURE
DRESSING
AND
LIVING
LIKE
ELIJAH
PREACHING
LIKE
ELIJAH
AND
FULFILLING
THE
PREDICTION
THAT
ELIJAH
WOULD
PREPARE
THE
WAY
FOR
THE
MESSIAH
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
HE
WAS
ELIJAH
IN
A
LITERAL
SENSE
AND
APPAREENTLY
NEITHER
DID
HE
JOHN
