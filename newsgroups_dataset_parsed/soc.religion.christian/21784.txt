WRITES
ANNI
DOZIER
WROTE
AFTER
READING
THE
POSTS
ON
THIS
NEWSGROUP
FOR
THE
PASTS
MONTHS
IT
HAS
BECOME
APPARENT
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
GROUP
IS
PRIMARILY
ACTIVE
WITH
LIBERALS
CATHOLICS
NEW
AGERS
AND
ATHIESTS
SOMEONE
MIGHT
THINK
ETC
SINCE
WHEN
DID
CONSERVATIVE
PROTESTANT
OLDTIME
RELIGION
BELIEVERS
GET
AN
EXCLUSIVE
FRANCISE
TO
CHRISTIANITY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
AND
ALWAYS
HAS
BEEN
A
DIVERSE
AND
CONTENTIOUS
TRADITION
AND
THIS
GROUP
REFLECTS
THAT
DIVERSITY
I
FO
ONE
AM
NOT
READY
TO
CONCEDE
TO
ANY
GROUP
BE
THEY
LIBERAL
OR
CONSERVATIVE
CATHOLIC
PROTESTANT
OR
ORTHODOX
CHARISMATIC
OR
NOT
THE
RIGHT
TO
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THE
TRUTH
AND
EVERYONE
ELSE
IS
NOT
CHRISTIAN
I
AM
BECOMING
INCREASINGLY
CONVINCED
THAT
MOST
OF
US
TAKE
PAULS
ILLUSTRATION
ABOUT
ONE
BODY
MANY
PARTS
FAR
TOO
NARROWLY
IT
IS
EASY
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
ONE
BODY
REPRESENTS
A
PARTICULAR
SECT
OF
CHRISTIANITY
GENERALLY
OUR
OWN
AND
THE
PARTS
ARE
CLEARLY
THE
VARIOUS
OFFICES
OF
MINISTRY
THERE
IS
A
PLACE
FOR
THAT
BUT
HAVING
MET
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
WALKING
CLOSEELY
WITH
GOD
IN
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
DOCTINE
CATHOLIC
PROTESTANT
LIBERAL
CONSERVATIVE
ORTHODOX
ETC
I
AM
WILLING
TO
ENCOMPASS
A
WIDE
SPECTRUM
OF
VIEWS
WITHIN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
AND
I
AM
EQUALLY
SURE
THAT
ONE
DAY
AFTER
WE
SHUG
OFF
THIS
MORTAL
COIL
WHEN
WE
NO
LONGER
SEE
THROUGH
A
GLASS
DARKLY
BUT
SEE
CLEARLY
FACE
TO
FACE
WE
WILL
ALL
BE
ASHAMED
AT
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
WE
HELD
AS
TRUTH
WE
OUGHT
ALL
FELLOWSHIP
WORSHIP
AND
SERVE
WHERE
WE
ARE
CALLED
AND
UNDERSTAND
THAT
WHERE
WE
ARE
CALLED
MAY
NOT
BE
WHERE
EVERYONE
ELSE
IS
CALLED
ONE
OF
THE
FATHERS
OF
THE
REFORMATION
HELP
ME
OUT
CANT
RECALL
THE
NAME
PUT
IT
QUITE
SUCCIENTLY
IN
ESSENTIALS
UNITY
IN
NONESSENTIALS
LIBERTY
IN
ALL
THINGS
CHARITY
WHILE
I
AGREE
WITH
LEWIS
MERE
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
CALLING
ONESELF
A
CHRISTIAN
IMPLIES
SOME
BASIC
FUNDAMENTAL
STANDARDS
OF
BELIEF
IF
THE
WORD
IS
TO
MEAN
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
I
THINK
MOST
OF
US
DEFINE
THE
BOUNDS
OF
ESSENTIALS
A
BIT
TOO
BROADLY
DENY
THE
PLACE
FOR
LIBERTY
IN
QUESTIONABLE
ISSUES
NEAR
THOSE
BOUNDS
AND
IGNORE
THE
REQUIREMENTS
OF
CHARITY
ALL
TOGETHER
ME
I
ATTEND
A
VINEYARD
CHURCH
SPEAK
IN
TONGUES
AM
EFFECTIVELY
AN
INERRANTIST
THOUGH
ILL
GRANT
SOME
INACCURACY
IN
TRANSLATION
AM
MODERATELY
PREMILL
AND
EVANGELICAL
BUT
IM
NOT
READY
TO
DAMN
THOSE
WHO
USE
ICONS
SAY
MASS
IN
LATIN
UPHOLD
THE
VIRGIN
MARY
THOUGH
I
REALLY
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
SHE
WAS
SINLESS
VOTE
ON
CHURCH
MEMBERSHIP
OR
INSIST
ON
BAPTISM
FOR
SALVATION
OF
COURSE
I
THINK
MY
DOCTINE
IS
PRETTY
CLOSE
TO
THE
TRUTH
WHY
WOULD
I
FOLLOW
IT
IF
I
BELIEVED
SOMETHING
ELSE
WAS
CLOSER
TO
THE
TRUTH
BUT
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
REALITY
OF
A
WALK
WITH
CHRIST
IS
CONTINUALLY
EVOLVING
AS
I
SPEND
MORE
AND
MORE
TIME
WALKING
WITH
HIM
STUDYING
HIS
WORD
AND
FELLOWSHIPING
WITH
OTHERS
IN
THE
OFTEN
EXTENDED
FAMILY
