personally
i
think
that
christians
shouldnt
fight
as
christians
we
are
not
supposed
to
defend
ourselves
matt
heb
war
is
a
result
of
sin
defense
may
be
a
necessary
reaction
to
an
attack
but
i
dont
think
that
we
as
christians
should
take
part
in
this
what
if
you
are
trying
to
defend
someone
else
should
you
allow
killing
and
oppression
to
continiue
or
is
it
our
obligation
to
protect
the
innocent
