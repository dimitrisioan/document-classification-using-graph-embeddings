RE
LEGAL
DEFINITION
OF
RELIGION
EPUNLEDU
EDGAR
PEARLSTEIN
WRITES
ITS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
US
SUPREME
COURT
HAS
NEVER
GIVEN
A
LEGAL
DEFINITION
OF
RELIGION
THIS
DESPITE
THE
MANY
CASES
INVOLVING
RELIGION
THAT
HAVE
COME
BEFORE
THE
COURT
CAN
ANYONE
VERIFY
OR
FALSIFY
THIS
HAS
ANY
STATE
OR
OTHER
GOVERNMENT
TRIED
TO
GIVE
A
LEGAL
DEFINITION
OF
RELIGION
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LEGAL
PRACTICES
OF
TODAYS
AMERICA
I
IMAGINE
THE
LEGAL
DEFINITION
OF
RELIGION
IF
DEFINED
MAY
RESEMBLE
THE
FOLLOWING
ANY
SYSTEM
OF
BELIEF
OR
PRACTICE
TO
WHICH
PEOPLE
ARE
COMMITTED
FOR
THE
BENEFIT
OF
SOCIETY
WHICH
MUST
IN
THE
OPINION
OF
SECULAR
THOUGHT
BE
ISOLATED
FROM
POLITICAL
AND
EDUCATIONAL
INFLUENCE
SHOULD
ANY
SYSTEM
OF
BELIEF
OR
PRACTICE
TO
WHICH
PEOPLE
ARE
COMMITTED
BE
HARMFUL
OR
VOID
OF
ANY
BENEFIT
TO
SOCIETY
IN
THE
OPINION
OF
RELIGIOUS
THOUGHT
AS
DEFINED
IN
THE
PREVIOUS
PARAGRAPH
ISOLATION
OF
SUCH
FROM
POLITICAL
AND
EDUCATIONAL
INFLUENCE
WOULD
CONSTITUTE
UNREASONABLE
CENSORSHIP
AND
AN
UNLAWFUL
VIOLATION
OF
CIVIL
RIGHTS
SOMEDAY
PERHAPS
THEYLL
LEGALIZE
BENEVOLENCE
