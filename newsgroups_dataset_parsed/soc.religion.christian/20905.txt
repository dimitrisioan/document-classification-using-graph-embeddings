RE
WHEN
ARE
TWO
PEOPLE
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
IN
ARTICLE
ROBLLMITEDU
WRITES
I
THINK
IT
WAS
LEWIS
WHO
SAID
THAT
IN
A
WEDDING
ITS
THE
PRINCIPALS
THAT
MARRY
EACH
OTHER
THE
CHURCH
AND
THE
STATE
ARE
PRESENT
MERELY
AS
WITNESSES
THIS
IS
NOT
JUST
LEWIS
ITS
A
SUMMARY
OF
STANDARD
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGY
HOWEVER
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THOSE
WITNESSES
IS
OPTIONAL
EXCEPT
IN
ODD
SITUATIONS
LIKE
THE
STANDARD
DESERT
ISLAND
CLH
I
ORIGINALLY
WROTE
TO
THE
PERSON
WHO
ASKED
THIS
QUESTION
PERSONALLY
BUT
DECIDED
TO
POST
THE
INFORMATION
I
HAD
ON
THE
TOPIC
I
SPOKE
TO
THE
PASTOR
OF
MY
PARISH
CATHOLIC
RECENTLY
BY
COINCIDENCE
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
HIS
EXPLAINATION
WAS
THAT
WHILE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
COUPLE
TO
MARRY
WITHOUT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
PRIEST
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
HAVE
IT
RECOGNIZED
BY
THE
CHURCH
AS
SOON
AS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
THE
CHURCH
RECOGINIZES
ITSELF
AS
A
COMMUNITY
OF
BELIEVERS
MEMBERS
OF
THE
CHURCH
TO
SOME
DEGREE
ARE
TO
BE
HELD
ACCOUNTABLE
TO
EACH
OTHER
TO
BE
LESS
HYPOTHETICAL
THAN
THAT
MYTHICAL
COUPLE
ON
THE
DESERT
ISLAND
THERE
ARE
MANY
PLACES
IN
THE
WORLD
THAT
DO
NOT
HAVE
PRIESTS
AVAILIBLE
FOR
MARRIAGES
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
THEREFORE
COUPLES
GET
MARRIED
WITHOUT
THE
PRIEST
BEING
PRESENT
BUT
GET
THE
PRIEST
TO
TESTIFY
TO
THEIR
MARRIAGE
WHEN
ONE
COMES
THROUGH
THE
AREA
I
REMEMBER
A
RELIGION
TEACHER
IN
HIGH
SCHOOL
SAYING
THAT
THE
MARRIAGE
CEREMONY
IS
NOT
FOR
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
COUPLE
AS
MUCH
AS
IT
IS
FOR
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
THUS
MARRIED
COUPLES
HAVE
SOME
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
THE
COMMUNITY
TO
STAY
MARRIED
AS
DIVORCE
SETS
A
BAD
EXAMPLE
FOR
THE
COMMUNITY
ALSO
THE
COUPLE
HAS
VOWED
TO
BECOME
ONE
WITH
ONE
ANOTHERTHE
COMMUNITY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
RELY
ON
THAT
COUPLE
TO
BE
AS
ONE
WHILE
COUPLES
MAY
MARRY
WITHOUT
WITNESSES
THEY
MAY
NOT
GET
ANULMENTS
WITHOUT
A
PRIEST
PRESENT
AN
ANULMENT
IS
SIMPLY
AN
ADMISSION
OF
THE
CHURCH
THAT
WHAT
THEY
HAD
DECLARED
A
MARRIAGE
WAS
NOT
IN
FACT
A
MARRIAGE
AT
ALL
FOR
WHATEVER
REASON
SO
DONT
START
GETTING
MARRIED
IN
THE
BACK
SEAT
OF
A
STATION
WAGON
AND
GIVING
YOURSELVES
ANULMENTS
A
HALFHOUR
LATER
I
TEND
TO
AGREE
WITH
THE
RESPONSE
BACK
THERE
THAT
SAID
COUPLES
BECOME
MARRIED
AS
SOON
AS
THEY
CONSUMATE
THEIR
MARRIAGE
BUT
I
WOULD
ADD
THAT
COUPLES
SHOULD
CONSIDER
THEIR
MARRIAGE
CONSUMATED
IF
THEY
HAVE
SEX
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
INTENDED
TO
BE
MARRIED
ASSUMING
THEY
WERE
BOTH
WILLING
PARTNERS
TO
THE
SEXUAL
ACT
THE
COUPLE
MUST
BE
PREPARED
TO
RAISE
ANY
CHILDREN
THEY
MAY
HAVE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THAT
SEXUAL
ACT
WITH
THE
BENEFIT
OF
BOTH
PARENTS
SEX
IS
A
COMMITMENT
I
BELIEVE
IN
GODS
EYES
BUT
IM
DIGRESSING
GOD
BE
WITH
YOU
MALCUSCO
