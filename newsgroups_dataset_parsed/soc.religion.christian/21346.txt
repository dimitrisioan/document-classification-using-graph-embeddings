TOD
SAID
A
CHRISTIAN
FRIEND
OF
MINE
ONCE
REASONED
THAT
IF
WE
WERE
NEVER
CREATED
THEN
WE
COULD
NOT
EXIST
THEREFORE
WE
WERE
CREATED
AND
THEREFORE
THERE
EXISTS
A
CREATOR
IS
THIS
STATEMENT
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
A
VALID
PROOF
BY
MANY
CHRISTIANS
AND
FOLLOWERS
OF
OTHER
RELIGIONS
I
SUPPOSE
REST
DELETED
SOME
VARIANT
IS
QUITE
POPULAR
THIS
AND
OTHER
ARGUMENTS
ARE
DISCUSSED

ARGUMENTS
FOR

AGAINST
THE

ALTHOUGH
MACKIE
ULTIMATELY
SIDES
WITH
AGAINST
HIS
ARGUMENTS
ARE

THINK
QUITE
FAIR
TO
BOTH
SIDES
