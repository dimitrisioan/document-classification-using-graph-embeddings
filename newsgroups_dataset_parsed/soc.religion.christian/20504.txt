what
did
lazarus
smell
like
in
the
discussion
as
to
why
jesus
spoke
aloud
the
lazarus
come
out
im
surprised
that
no
one
has
noticed
the
verse
immediately
preceeding
jn
father
i
thank
you
for
listening
to
me
though
i
knew
that
you
always
listen
to
me
but
i
have
said
this
for
the
sake
of
the
people
that
are
standing
around
me
that
they
may
believe
that
you
have
made
my
your
messenger

translation
my
guess
is
that
the
lazarus
come
out
was
also
for
the
sake
of
the
