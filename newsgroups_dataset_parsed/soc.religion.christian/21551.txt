FAQ
ESSAY
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
OUR
MODERATOR
WRITES
I
BELIEVE
ONE
COULD
TAKE
A
VIEW
LIKE
THIS
EVEN
WHILE
ACCEPTING
THE
VIEWS
PAUL
EXPRESSED
IN
ROM
ONE
MAY
BELIEVE
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
NOT
WHAT
GOD
INTENDED
THAT
IT
OCCURED
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SIN
BUT
STILL
CONCLUDE
THAT
AT
TIMES
WE
HAVE
TO
LIVE
WITH
IT
NOTE
THAT
IN
THE
CREATION
STORY
WORK
ENTERS
HUMAN
LIFE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SIN
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
CHRISTIANS
CAN
STOP
WORKING
WHEN
WE
ARE
SAVED
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
GOD
COMMANDED
ADAM
TO
WORK
BEFORE
THE
FALL
THE
LORD
GOD
TOOK
THE
MAN
AND
PUT
HIM
IN
THE
GARDEN
OF
EDEN
TO
WORK
IT
AND
TAKE
CARE
OF
IT
GEN
NIV
WORK
WAS
GODS
DESIGN
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
KEN
ILL
CLARIFY
THE
WORDING
THERE
WAS
OBVIOUSLY
A
RATHER
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
LABOR
IMPOSED
AFTER
THE
FALL
BUT
THE
STATEMENT
AS
IT
STANDS
IS
MISLEADING
