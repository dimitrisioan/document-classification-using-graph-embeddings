referring
to
mary
she
was
immaculately
conceived
and
so
never
subject
to
original
sin
but
also
never
committed
a
personal
sin
in
her
whole
life
this
was
possible
because
of
the
special
degree
of
grace
granted
to
her
by
god
i
have
quite
a
problem
with
the
idea
that
mary
never
committed
a
sin
was
mary
fully
human
if
it
is
possible
for
god
to
miraculously
make
a
person
free
of
original
sin
and
free
of
committing
sin
their
whole
life
then
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
incarnation
of
jesus
why
cant
god
just
repeat
the
miracle
done
for
mary
to
make
all
the
rest
of
us
sinless
without
the
need
for
repentance
and
salvation
and
all
that
i
dont
particularly
object
to
the
idea
of
the
assumption
or
the
perpetual
virginity
both
of
which
i
regard
as
catholic
dogma
about
which
i
will
agree
to
disagree
with
my
catholic
brothers
and
sisters
in
christ
and
i
even
believe
in
the
virgin
birth
of
jesus
but
this
concept
of
marys
sinlessness
seems
to
me
to
be
at
odds
with
the
rest
of
christian
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
if
you
dont
agree
with
josephs
accurate
statement
of
the
catholic
dogma
of
marys
perpetual
sinlessness
then
how
do
you
interpret
luke
and
when
the
angel
had
come
to
her
he
said
hail
full
of
grace
the
lord
is
with
thee
blessed
art
thou
among
women
and
luke
for
behold
henceforth
all
generations
shall
call
me
blessed
i
suppose
that
these
verses
might
be
interpreted
to
mean
that
mary
was
possessed
of
some
limited
quantity
or
quality
of
grace
just
as
some
of
us
are
but
it
seems
to
me
that
full
of
grace
means
just
what
it
says
filled
to
the
brim
incapable
of
containing
more
the
only
other
people
we
know
of
who
have
an
abundance
of
grace
are
those
souls
existing
in
heaven
now
another
catholic
dogma
based
on
the
communion
of
saints
as
i
explained
in
an
earlier
post
full
of
grace
to
me
means
sinless
and
anyone
who
has
ever
sinned
in
his
life
cannot
be
without
sin
in
the
same
sense
as
mary
was
sinless
as
a
catholic
i
too
find
certain
of
the
dogmas
tough
to
embrace
but
thats
where
the
catholic
faith
and
prayer
come
into
play
i
pray
god
to
strengthen
my
will
to
accept
the
faith
given
the
bride
of
christ
which
in
turn
usually
strengthens
my
community
faith
in
his
church
and
as
you
probably
know
faith
in
christs
church
is
tantamount
to
faith
in
christ
inasmuch
as
the
church
is
christs
mystical
body
a
catholic
by
nature
must
have
two
aspects
to
his
faith
in
christ
a
personal
faith
in
christ
as
his
own
personal
redeemer
and
a
community
faith
in
the
church
as
the
body
of
christ
