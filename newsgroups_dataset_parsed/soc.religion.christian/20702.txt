CHANTING
OF
THE
PASSION
MIKE
ROLFE
WRITES
IF
YOU
KNOW
THE
LATIN
ONE
REALLY
BEAUTIFUL
WAY
TO
HEAR
THE
PASSION
IS
ITS
BEING
CHANTED
BY
THREE
DEACONS
THE
NARRATOR
CHANTS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
BARITONE
RANGE
JESUS
CHANTS
IN
THE
BASS
AND
OTHERS
DIRECTLY
QUOTED
ARE
HANDLED
BY
A
HIGH
TENOR
THIS
IS
DONE
IN
ENGLISH
SAME
MUSIC
AS
THE
TRADITIONAL
LATIN
IN
MANY
ANGLICAN
PARISHES
I
SHOULD
EXPECT
THAT
MANY
RCC
PARISHES
WOULD
DO
LIKEWISE
THE
ST
MATTHEW
PASSION
AND
ST
JOHN
PASSION
OF
J
S
BACH
ARE
DIRECT
OFFSHOOTS
OF
THIS
TRADITION
