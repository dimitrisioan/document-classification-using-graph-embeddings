WRITES
THE
CONCEPT
OF
TONGUES
AS
USED
AT
PENTECOST
SEEMS
AN
OUTDATED
CONCEPT
NOW
WITH
THE
BIBLE
AVAILABLE
IN
NEARLY
EVERY
LANGUAGE
AND
MISSIONARIES
WHO
ARE
OUT
THERE
IN
ALL
LANGUAGES
WHY
DOES
THE
CHURCH
NEED
TONGUES
I
GUESS
THERE
ARE
AT
LEAST
SOME
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
NOT
ABLE
TO
SUPPORT
THIS
CLAIM
THERE
ARE
STILL
A
LOT
OF
LANGUAGES
WITHOUT
THE
BIBLE
OR
A
PART
OF
THE
BIBLE
THERE
ARE
STILL
MANY
LANGUAGES
WHICH
WE
ARE
NOT
ABLE
TO
WRITE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
WRITTEN
VERSION
OF
THE
LANGUAGE
HAS
NOT
YET
BEEN
DEFINED
YES
I
SUPPOSE
THATS
TRUE
OF
COURSE
NOTICE
I
QUALIFIED
WITH
NEARLY
EVERY
LANGUAGE
AND
THERE
ARE
MISSIONARIES
OUT
THERE
WHO
CAN
SPEAK
EVERY
IMAGINABLE
LANGUAGE
AND
DIALECT
BUT
THEN
THE
FACT
THAT
NOT
ALL
LANGUAGES
HAVE
A
WRITTEN
GOSPEL
LENDS
NO
CREDENCE
TO
THE
CONCEPT
OF
PENTECOST
TYPE
XENOGLOSSOLALIA
SINCE
MOST
TONGUES
OCCUR
NOT
IN
THESE
PLACES
OF
UNWRITTEN
LANGUAGE
BUT
RATHER
IN
CHURCHES
FULL
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
HAVE
A
WRITTEN
LANGUAGE
AND
A
BIBLE
IN
THAT
LANGUAGE
BUT
I
