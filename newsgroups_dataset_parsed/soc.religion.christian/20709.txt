RE
QUESTION
JESUS
ALONE
ONENESS
REGARDING
JESUS
ONLY
BELIEVERS
OUR
MODERATOR
WRITES
THERE
MAY
BE
SOME
MISUNDERSTANDING
OVER
TERMS
HERE
I
AGREE
QUITE
LIKELY
ACTUALLY
I
BELIEVE
JESUS
ONLY
ORIGINALLY
WAS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
BAPTISM
THESE
ARE
FOLKS
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
BAPTISM
SHOULD
BE
DONE
WITH
A
FORMULA
MENTIONING
ONLY
JESUS
RATHER
THAN
FATHER
SON
AND
HOLY
SPIRIT
THIS
MAY
HAVE
DOCTRINAL
IMPLICATIONS
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
IT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THESE
FOLKS
DENY
THE
EXISTENCE
OR
DIVINITY
OF
THE
FATHER
IM
NOT
THE
RIGHT
ONE
TO
DESCRIBE
THIS
THEOLOGY
AND
IN
FACT
I
THINK
THERE
MAY
BE
SEVERAL
INCLUDING
WHAT
WOULD
CLASSICALLY
BE
CALLED
MONOPHYSITE
OR
ARIAN
TWO
RATHER
DIFFERENT
VIEWS
AS
WELL
AS
SOME
WHO
HAVE
BELIEFS
THAT
ARE
PROBABLY
CONSISTENT
WITH
TRINITARIAN
STANDARDS
BUT
WHO
WONT
USE
TRINITARIAN
LANGUAGE
BECAUSE
THEY
MISUNDERSTAND
IT
OR
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IT
IS
NOT
BIBLICAL
CLH
NOT
BIBLICAL
WHAT
THEN
CAN
THEY
MAKE
OF
THE
END
OF
MATTHEW
JESUS
CAME
AND
SAID
TO
THEM
ALL
AUTHORITY
IN
HEAVEN
AND
ON
EARTH
HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
TO
ME
THEREFORE
AND
MAKE
DISCIPLES
OF
ALL
NATIONS
BAPTIZING
THEM
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
FATHER
AND
OF
THE
SON
AND
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
AND
TEACHING
THEM
TO
OBEY
EVERYTHING
THAT
I
HAVE
COMMANDED
TO
YOU
AND
REMEMBER
I
AM
WITH
YOU
ALWAYS
TO
THE
END
OF
THE
AGE
OTHER
ANCIENT
AUTHORITIES
ADD
AMEN
NRSV
THE
NOTES
GIVE
NO
SENSE
THAT
THIS
IS
EMENDED
DO
OTHER
TEXTS
CONTRADICT
THIS
REGARDING
BAPTISM
OR
IS
A
MISUNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
TRINITY
THE
MOST
LIKELY
EXPLANATION
AFTER
ALL
BUT
MAYBE
I
SIMPLY
MISUNDERSTAND
THEIR
VIEWS
IS
ANYONE
ELSE
OUT
THERE
FORCED
TO
READ
THIS
GROUP
WITH
BOTH
A
GOOD
BIBLE
AND
AN
UNABRIDGED
DICTIONARY
CHRISTIANITY
REALLY
IS
AN
EDUCATION
IN
ITSELF
DAVID

TUCKER
DRTATHENAMITEDU
ARRGGGGHHHH
WHEN
I
TALKED
ABOUT
PEOPLE
WHO
REJECTED
TRINITARIAN
LANGUAGE
AS
UNBIBLICAL
I
WAS
SPEAKING
OF
TRINITARIAN
THEOLOGY
THINGS
LIKE
ONE
ESSENSE
AND
THREE
PERSONS
OBVIOUSLY
THE
THREEFOLD
BAPTISMAL
FORMULA
IS
BIBLICAL
AS
YOU
POINT
OUT
I
NORMALLY
USE
THE
TERM
THREEFOLD
IN
REFERRING
TO
MAT
WHILE
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
CONSISTENT
WITH
BELIEF
IN
THE
TRINITY
THE
TRINITY
IS
A
DOCTRINE
WHOSE
FULL
FORMULATION
OCCURRED
IN
THE
AND
CENTS
ITS
UNLIKELY
THAT
MAT
HAD
IN
MIND
THE
FULLYDEVELOPED
TRINITARIAN
DOCTRINE
INDEED
THE
THREEFOLD
BAPTISMAL
FORMULA
IS
USED
BY
SOME
GROUPS
THAT
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
TRINITY
THE
DISAGREEMENT
OVER
BAPTISMAL
FORMULAE
OCCURS
BECAUSE
OF
PASSAGES
SUCH
AS
ACTS
WHICH
COMMAND
BAPTISM
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
OTHER
PASSAGES
IN
ACTS
AS
WELL
THIS
LEAVES
US
WITH
SORT
OF
A
PROBLEM
WERE
COMMANDED
IN
MAT
TO
BAPTIZE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
FATHER
THE
SON
AND
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
AND
IN
ACTS
TO
BAPTIZE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
JESUS
ONLY
GROUPS
BAPTIZE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
THEY
CONSIDER
THIS
CONSISTENT
WITH
MAT
BECAUSE
THEY
SAY
THAT
JESUS
IS
THE
NAME
OF
THE
FATHER
THE
SON
AND
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IM
NOT
THE
RIGHT
ONE
TO
ASK
TO
EXPLAIN
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
I
WILL
SIMPLY
SAY
THAT
IT
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
TO
BE
NORMAL
TRINITARIAN
THEOLOGY
IT
IS
ALSO
AN
ODD
WAY
OF
DEALING
WITH
THE
IDIOMATIC
PHRASE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THOSE
WHO
USE
THE
THREEFOLD
FORMULA
DONT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
STANDARD
ANSWER
TO
THE
PASSAGES
TALKING
ABOUT
BAPTIZING
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
MOST
COMMON
EXPLANATION
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
IN
THE
NAME
OF
NEED
NOT
BE
A
VERBAL
FORMULA
TO
SAY
THAT
YOU
BAPTIZE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
MAY
SIMPLY
MEAN
THAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
BAPTISM
UNDER
JESUS
AUTHORITY
IN
THE
CENT
CONTEXT
IT
CONTRASTS
CHRISTIAN
BAPTISM
WITH
THE
BAPTISM
OF
JOHN
OR
OTHER
JEWISH
BAPTISM
OF
COURSE
THERES
A
CERTAIN
PARALLELISM
BETWEEN
THESE
PASSAGES
THAT
SUGGESTS
THAT
WE
COULD
JUST
AS
WELL
SAY
THAT
MAT
DOESNT
REQUIRE
THE
SPECIFIC
THREEFOLD
FORMULA
TO
BE
USED
IN
BAPTISM
BUT
SIMPLY
CHARACTERIZES
BAPTISM
DONE
BY
THOSE
WHO
FOLLOW
THE
FATHER
SON
AND
HOLY
SPIRIT
ONE
MIGHT
WELL
SUSPECT
THAT
IN
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
MORE
THAN
ONE
BAPTISMAL
FORMULA
WAS
USED
SO
LONG
AS
WE
CONSIDER
FOLLOWING
JESUS
TO
BE
THE
SAME
AS
FOLLOWING
THE
FATHER
SON
AND
HOLY
SPIRIT
NO
GREAT
DAMAGE
WOULD
BE
DONE
BY
SUCH
A
DIFFERENCE
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
I
THINK
WE
SHOULD
GO
BACK
TO
USING
BOTH
FORMULAE
BAPTISM
IS
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
THINGS
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
CHRISTIAN
GROUPS
NOW
RECOGNIZE
MUTUALLY
SO
I
DO
NOT
THINK
DOING
SOMETHING
TO
UPSET
THAT
WOULD
BE
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
THE
GOSPEL
THIS
IS
REINFORCED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
THOSE
GROUPS
THAT
ACTUALLY
USE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
NOW
DO
SEEM
TO
HAVE
IN
MIND
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
DOCTRINE
BUT
AS
IVE
SAID
BEFORE
IM
NOT
THE
ONE
TO
EXPLAIN
WHAT
THEIR
DOCTRINE
IS
CLH
