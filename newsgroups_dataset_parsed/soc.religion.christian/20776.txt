RE
PRAYERS
AND
ADVICE
REQUESTED
ON
FAMILY
PROBLEM
JULIE
IT
IS
A
REALLY
TRYING
SITUATION
THAT
YOU
HAVE
DESCRIBED
MY
BROTHER
WAS
LIVING
WITH
SOMEONE
LIKE
THAT
AND
THINGS
WERE
ALMOST
AS
BAD
ALTHOUGH
HE
LEFT
AFTER
A
CONSIDERABLY
SHORTER
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
DUE
TO
OTHER
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
RELATIONSHIP
ANYWAY
THE
BEST
THING
TO
DO
WOULD
BE
TO
GET
EVERYONE
IN
THE
SAME
ROOM
TOGETHER
OPTIMALLY
IN
A
ROOM
WITH
NOTHING
BREAKABLE
LOCK
THE
DOOR
BEHIND
YOU
THROW
THE
KEY
OUT
UNDERNEATH
THE
DOOR
JUST
AS
FAR
AS
THE
LONGEST
HAND
CAN
REACH
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
OUT
AFTER
THE
CONCLUSION
I
WOULD
IMAGINE
AND
HASH
THINGS
OUT
MORE
THAN
LIKELY
THERE
WILL
BE
SCREAMING
CRYING
AND
POSSIBLY
HITTING
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
SOMEONE
DECIDED
TO
BRING
SOME
ROPE
TO
TIE
PEOPLE
DOWN
SOME
OF
THE
BEST
STRATEGIES
IN
KEEPING
THINGS
CALMER
WOULD
INCLUDE
HAVE
EACH
INDIVIDUAL
OWN
THEIR
OWN
STATEMENTS
IE
I
FEEL
THAT
THIS
RELATIONSHIP
IS
HURTING
EVERYONE
INVOLVED
BECAUSE
OR
I
REALLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHERE
YOURE
COMING
FROM
REINFORCE
STATEMENTS
BY
PARAPHRASING
ETC
IE
SO
YOU
THINK
THAT
WE
DID
THIS
BECAUSE
OF
WELL
LET
ME
JUST
SAY
THAT
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
WAS
DONT
ACCUSE
EACH
OTHER
IT
WAS
YOUR
FAULT
THAT
HAPPENED
FIND
A
COMMON
GROUND
ABOUT
SOMETHING
LAMPSHADES
REALLY
ARE
DECORATIONAL
AND
FUNCTIONAL
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
GUARANTEED
IN
A
SITUATION
LIKE
THIS
THERE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
SOME
GUNNYSACKING
REHASHING
TOPICS
WHICH
WERE
ASSUMED
RESOLVED
BUT
WERE
TRULY
NOT
AND
SOMEONE
FEELS
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
TO
BLAME
HOWEVER
THIS
SHOULD
BE
KEPT
TO
A
MINIMUM
AND
SIMPLY
ASK
FOR
FORGIVENESS
OR
APOLOGIZE
ABOUT
EACH
SITUATION
WITHOUT
HOLDING
A
SMOLDERING
GRUDGE
THE
RELATIONSHIP
REALLY
CAN
WORK
ITS
JUST
A
MATTER
OF
KEEPING
THINGS
SMOOTH
AND
EVEN
ITS
SORT
OF
LIKE
MAKING
A
PEACE
TREATY
BETWEEN
WARRING
FACTIONS
YOU
CANT
GIVE
ONE
SIDE
EVERYTHING
THERE
MUST
BE
A
COMPROMISE
BREAKS
CAN
BE
TAKEN
BUT
COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN
EVERYONE
INVOLVED
MUST
CONTINUE
IF
THE
RELATIONSHIPS
HERE
ARE
TO
SURVIVE
