germany
they
first
came
for
the
communists
and
i
didnt

wasnt
a
communist
then
they
came
for
the
jews
and
i
didnt
speak
up
because
i
wasnt
a
jew
then
they
came
for
the
trade
unionists
and
i
didnt
speak
up
because
i
wasnt
a
trade
unionist
then
they
came
for
the
homosexuals
and
i
didnt
speak
up
because
i
wasnt
a
homosexual
then
they
came
for
the
catholics
and
i
didnt
