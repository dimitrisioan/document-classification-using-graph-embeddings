WHO
READ
THIS
LIST
IF
YOU
ARENT
CHRISTIAN
AND
IF
YOU
HAVE
NO
INTENTION
OF
EVER
BECOMING
ONE
WHY
ON
EARTH
DO
YOU
WASTE
YOUR
TIME
AND
MINE
BY
PARTICIPATING
ON
A
CHRISTIAN
DISCUSSION
LIST
I
FIND
THIS
REMARK
TO
BE
AWFULLY
ARROGANT
I
WOULD
VENTURE
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
ARE
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
CHRISTIANS
NOW
WHO
AT
ONE
POINT
IN
THEIR
LIVES
HAD
NO
INTENTION
OF
EVER
BECOMING
A
CHRISTIAN
I
WAS
CERTAINLY
ONE
SUCH
PERSON
I
AM
QUITE
THANKFUL
THAT
THERE
WERE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
WERE
WILLING
TO
CONTINUE
TO
TALK
TO
ME
DESPITE
THE
APPEARANCE
THAT
IT
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
A
WASTE
OF
THEIR
TIME
AND
MINE
I
EVEN
MARRIED
ONE
OF
THEM
ALWAYS
BE
PREPARED
TO
GIVE
AN
ANSWER
TO
EVERYONE
WHO
ASKS
YOU
TO
GIVE
A
REASON
FOR
THE
HOPE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BUT
DO
THIS
WITH
GENTLENESS
AND
RESPECT
