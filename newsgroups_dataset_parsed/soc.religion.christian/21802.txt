IN
RESPONSE
TO
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
WHY
JESUS
PARENTS
WOULD
BE
SANCTIFIED
BEYOND
NORMAL
HUMANITY
WHEN
ELIZABETH
GREETED
MARY
ELIZABETH
SAID
SOMETHING
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
MARY
OUT
OF
ALL
WOMEN
WAS
BLESSED
IF
SO
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THIS
EXACTLY
PLACES
MARY
BEYOND
THE
SANCTIFICATION
OF
NORMAL
HUMANITY
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
SIMPLY
BEING
PREGNANT
WITH
THE
INCARNATION
OF
THE
ALMIGHTY
GOD
WOULD
BE
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
MARY
BLESSED
AMONG
ALL
WOMEN
WHETHER
OR
NOT
SHE
HAD
SPECIAL
SPIRITUAL
ATTRIBUTES
I
FIND
THAT
THE
MORE
SPECIAL
MARY
NEEDS
TO
BE
THE
LESS
HUMAN
JESUS
