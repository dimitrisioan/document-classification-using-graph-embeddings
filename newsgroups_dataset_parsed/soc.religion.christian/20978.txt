M
PRICE
WRITES
IM
CONCERNED
ABOUT
A
RECENT
POSTING
ABOUT
WBTSIL
I
THOUGHT
THEYD
PRETTY
MUCH
BEEN
DENOUNCED
AS
A
RIGHTWING
ORGANIZATION
INVOLVED
IN
IDEOLOGICAL
MANIPULATION
AND
CULTURAL
INTERFERENCE
INCLUDING
VIETNAM
AND
SOUTH
AMERICA
A
COMMISSION
FROM
MEXICAN
ACADEMIA
DENOUNCED
THEM
IN
AS
A
COVERT
POLITICAL
AND
IDEOLOGICAL
INSTITUTION
USED
BY
THE
US
GOVT
AS
AN
INSTRUMENT
OF
CONTROL
REGULATION
PENETRATION
ESPIONAGE
AND
REPRESSION
I
HAVE
PERSONALLY
KNOW
QUITE
OF
FEW
OF
THE
WYCLIFFE
BIBLE
TRANSLATORS
AS
AN
ORGANIZATION
THEIR
FUNDAMENTAL
PURPOSE
IS
TO
TRANSLATE
THE
SCRIPTURES
INTO
THE
NATIVE
LANGUAGES
WHICH
IN
TERMS
USUAL
MEANS
LEARNING
IT
AND
DEVELOPING
A
WRITTEN
LANGUAGE
ALONG
WITH
TEACHING
THE
NATIVES
TO
READ
IT
IS
NOT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
US
GOVT
AT
ALL
MANY
GOVERNMENTS
WANT
THE
HELP
OF
THE
TRANSLATORS
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
THE
MEXICAN
GOVERNMENT
NOW
ENCOURAGES
THEM
TO
COME
THEIR
IDEA
IS
NOT
CULTURAL
INTERFERENCE
BUT
THE
PRESENTATION
OF
THE
GOOD
NEWS
TO
UNDERSTAND
MORE
ABOUT
WHAT
THEY
DO
I
SUGGEST
YOU
READ
SOME
OF
THE
BOOKS
AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL
AND
BIOGRAPHICAL
ABOUT
SOME
OF
THE
TRANSLATORS
ONE
THAT
STANDS
OUT
IN
MY
MIND
AS
AN
EXCELLENT
IS
CALLED
PEACE
CHILD
THIS
WOULD
GIVE
A
TRUE
PICTURE
OF
WHAT
THEIR
MISSION
IS
MY
CONCERN
IS
THAT
THIS
GROUP
MAY
BE
SEEN
AS
ACCEPTABLE
AND
EVEN
PRAISEWORTHY
BY
READERS
OF
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
ITS
IMPORTANT
THAT
CHRISTIANS
DONT
IMMEDIATELY
ACCEPT
EVERY
CHRISTIAN
ORGANIZATION
AS
AUTOMATICALLY
ABOVE
REPROACH
MP
I
AGREE
WITH
THIS
STATEMENT
BUT
WE
CANNOT
ALSO
ACCEPT
WHAT
OTHERS
SAY
WITHOUT
LOOKING
INTO
THE
ISSUES
THAT
WOULD
BE
THE
SAME
AS
TAKING
SUDDANS
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
THE
CIA
ETC
AS
BEING
TRUE
WE
MUST
LOOK
AT
BOTH
SIDES
