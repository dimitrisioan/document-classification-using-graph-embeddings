RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
EUGENE
BIGELOW
WRITES
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
SAY
THAT
GOD
IS
A
FAIR
GOD
SIC
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
HOW
CAN
THIS
POSSIBLY
BE
FAIR
TO
THE
INFANTS
ANDREW
BYLER
WRITES
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
FAIR
GOD
IS
JUST
GIVING
TO
EVERYONE
WHAT
THEY
DESERVE
AS
ALL
INFANTS
ARE
IN
SIN
FROM
THE
TIME
OF
CONCEPTION
CF
ROMANS
PSALM
THEY
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
MERIT
HEAVEN
AND
AS
PURGATORY
IS
FOR
THE
PURGING
OF
TEMPORAL
PUNISHMENT
AND
VENIAL
SINS
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
THAT
ORIGIANL
SIN
CAN
BE
FORGIVEN
AS
ST
AUGUSTINE
SAID
I
DID
NOT
INVENT
ORIGINAL
SIN
WHICH
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
HOLDS
FROM
ANCIENT
TIME
BUT
YOU
WHO
DENY
IT
WITHOUT
A
DOUBT
ARE
A
FOLLOWER
OF
A
NEW
HERESY
DE
NUPTIIS
LIB
WHY
IS
IT
FAIR
TO
PUNISH
YOU
ME
AND
THE
REST
OF
HUMANITY
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
ADAM
AND
EVE
DID
SUPPOSE
YOUR
PARENTS
COMMITTED
SOME
CRIME
BEFORE
YOU
WERE
BORN
AND
ONE
DAY
THE
COPS
COME
TO
YOUR
DOOR
AND
THROW
YOU
IN
JAIL
FOR
IT
WOULD
YOU
REALLY
THINK
THAT
IS
FAIR
I
KNOW
I
WOULDNT
