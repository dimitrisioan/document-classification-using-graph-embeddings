RE
JACOB
AND
ESAU
REINCARNATION
IN
ARTICLE
JEKCUNIHGOV
WRITES
GERRY
PALO
WROTE
THAT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
EXCLUDES
THE
THEORY
OF
A
SUCCESSION
OF
LIVES
I
WROTE
THAT
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
IN
ROMANS
SPEAKS
OF
GOD
AS
CHOOSING
JACOB
OVER
ESAU
AND
ADDS
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
AS
A
RESULT
OF
ANYTHING
THAT
EITHER
CHILD
HAD
DONE
SINCE
THEY
HAD
NOT
BEEN
BORN
YET
CLEARLY
PAUL
DOES
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
HAD
HAD
PREVIOUS
LIVES
NOR
DOES
HE
SUPPOSE
THAT
HIS
READERS
WILL
BELIEVE
IT
FOR
IF
THEY
HAD
HAD
PREVIOUS
LIVES
IT
WOULD
NOT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
SAY
NEITHER
OF
THEM
HAS
DONE
ANYTHING
GOOD
OR
BAD
AS
YET
SINCE
THEY
ARE
NOT
YET
BORN
PAULS
STATEMENT
ONLY
ASSERTS
THAT
THAT
PARTICULAR
CHOICE
WAS
NOT
A
MATTER
OF
KARMIC
FULFILLMENT
OF
THE
PAST
JUST
AS
THE
FATE
OF
THE
MAN
BORN
BLIND
JOHN
WAS
NOT
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
HERE
OF
THE
SIMPLISTIC
IDEA
OF
KARMA
AS
A
MACHINE
THAT
IS
THE
SOLE
DETERMINER
OF
ONES
DESTINY
EVEN
THE
EASTERN
TRADITIONS
OR
MANY
OF
THEM
DO
NOT
SAY
THAT
AS
ONE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
POSTER
POINTED
OUT
AND
IF
IN
FACT
THAT
PAUL
DID
NOT
KNOW
ABOUT
OR
BELIEVE
IN
REINCARNATION
DOES
NOT
SAY
ANYTHING
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
ABOUT
IT
EVEN
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
WHO
JESUS
SAYS
EMPHATICALLY
IS
ELIJAH
MATT
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
BEEN
AWARE
OF
IT
AT
LEAST
AT
THE
POINT
AT
WHICH
HE
WAS
ASKED
BUT
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THAT
HIS
THREEFOLD
DENIAL
TO
THE
QUESTION
WHETHER
HE
IS
THE
CHRIST
THE
PROPHET
IE
ISAIAH
OR
ELIJAH
IS
EMPHATIC
IN
THE
FIRST
CASE
AND
VERY
WEAK
IN
THE
THIRD
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ADD
ONCE
AGAIN
THAT
WHILE
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
DISCUSS
THE
DIFFERENT
PASSAGES
THAT
MAY
POINT
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
TEACHING
OF
REPEATED
EARTH
LIVES
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
WHAT
I
REALLY
SEE
AS
IMPORTANT
IN
OUR
TIME
IS
THAT
THE
SUBJECT
BE
REVISITED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
LARGER
VIEW
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AND
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THOSE
WHO
DO
ACCEPT
IT
EITHER
REJECT
THE
CENTRAL
IDEAS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
OR
IF
THEY
ARE
CHRISTIANS
HOLD
THEIR
CONVICTION
AS
A
KIND
OF
SEPARATE
TREASURE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
IMPORTANT
NEW
UNDERSTANDING
TO
BRING
TO
BEAR
ON
IT
AND
VICE
VERSA
MUCH
THAT
IS
CENTRAL
TO
CHRISTIANITY
TAKES
ON
ENTIRELY
NEW
DIMENSIONS
OF
MEANING
IN
LIGHT
OF
REPEATED
EARTH
LIVES
IT
HAS
A
DIRECT
BEARING
ON
MANY
OF
THE
ISSUES
FREQUENTLY
DISCUSSED
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
IN
PARTICULAR
I
HAVE
SAID
OPENLY
THAT
I
HAVE
DEVELOPED
MY
VIEWS
OF
REPEATED
EARTH
LIVES
LARGELY
FROM
THE
WORK
OF
RUDOLF
STEINER
NOT
THAT
I
HOLD
HIM
AS
AN
AUTHORITY
BUT
THE
WHOLE
PICTURE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
BECOMES
CLEARER
IN
LIGHT
OF
THESE
IDEAS
STEINER
INDICATED
THAT
THE
OLD
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
REINCAR
NATION
NECESSARILY
HAD
TO
FADE
AWAY
THAT
IT
COULD
BE
RENEWED
IN
LATER
TIMES
AFTER
A
TIME
OF
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
CHRIST
IDEA
THROUGH
THE
FIRST
TWO
MILLENIA
AFTER
CHRISTS
DEED
ON
GOLGOTHA
IN
OUR
OWN
TIME
IT
BECOMES
IMPORTANT
THAT
HAVING
RECEIVED
THE
BASIC
GOSPEL
OF
SALVATION
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
LIFE
AND
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING
CAN
NOW
GROW
TO
EMBRACE
THE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
THIS
IDEA
FOR
THE
DISCUSSIONS
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
FOCUS
ON
THAT
WHICH
CAN
BE
RELATED
AS
DIRECTLY
AS
POSSIBLE
TO
SCRIPTURE
AND
TO
FUNDAMENTAL
CHRISTIAN
TEACHING
AND
TRADITION
GERRY
