RE
CHRISTIANS
THAT
ARE
NOT
CHURCH
MEMBERS
IN
ARTICLE
GCHINSSFENGSUNCOM
WRITES
OVER
THE
YEARS
I
HAVE
MET
CHRISTIANS
WHO
ARE
NOT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
ANY
LOCAL
CHURCH
AND
ARE
NOT
MEMBERS
OF
ANY
LOCAL
CHURCH
THIS
IS
AN
ISSUE
THAT
MAY
BE
VERY
PERSONAL
BUT
IS
IMPORTANT
WHAT
DOES
THE
BIBLE
SAY
ABOUT
THIS
AND
HOW
CAN
WE
ENCOURAGE
OUR
FRIENDS
WITH
REGARD
TO
THIS
ISSUE
THIS
BRINGS
UP
AN
INTERESTING
SUBJECT
THAT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
DISCUSSED
MUCH
AND
PROBABLY
HAS
NOT
BEEN
STUDIED
MUCH
AS
SOME
OF
YOU
MAY
BE
AWARE
IVE
POSTED
A
LOT
OF
ARTICLES
LATELY
ON
PERSONALITY
TYPING
OF
WHICH
THE
MBTI
IS
A
TEST
VEHICLE
TO
COME
UP
TO
SPEED
JUST
READ
ALTPSYCHOLOGYPERSONALITY
ANDOR
ASK
FOR
BY
PERSONALITY
TYPE
SUMMARY
FILE
ONE
OBSERVATION
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
HAVE
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
PERSONALITIES
NO
QUESTION
ON
THIS
WHICH
SEEM
TO
BE
ESSENTIALLY
INBORN
WITH
RESPECT
TO
CHURCH
ATTENDANCE
AND
PARTICIPATION
SOME
PEOPLE
THRIVE
ON
THIS
WHILE
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVE
REAL
DIFFICULTY
WITH
THIS
BECAUSE
THEY
PREFER
A
MORE
SOLITARY
AND
CONTEMPLATIVE
LIFESTYLE
THAT
IS
THEY
ARE
DEENERGIZED
IF
CONFRONTED
WITH
EXCESSIVE
CLOSENESS
TO
OUTSIDE
ACTIVITIES
AND
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
OF
COURSE
THIS
IS
MEASURED
BY
EXTROVERSIONINTROVERSION
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
MANY
CHURCHES
ARE
TOTALLY
BLIND
TO
THIS
FACT
AND
CREATE
ENVIRONMENTS
THAT
SCARE
AWAY
MANY
WHO
ARE
NATURALLY
INTROVERTED
THERE
ARE
MANY
INTROVERTED
CHARACTERS
IN
THE
BIBLE
BTW
I
KNOW
I
AM
QUITE
INTROVERTED
IN
PREFERENCE
AND
FIND
THE
PRESSURE
BY
MANY
CHURCHES
TO
PARTICIPATE
TO
MEET
TOGETHER
IN
LARGE
GROUPS
ETC
TO
BE
VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE
KNOWING
WHAT
I
KNOW
NOW
THESE
CHURCHES
HAVE
BEEN
OVERLY
INFLUENCED
BY
HIGHLY
EXTROVERTED
PEOPLE
WHO
THRIVE
ON
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
BTW
THERES
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
EITHER
EXTROVERSION
OR
INTROVERSION
BOTH
PREFERENCES
HAVE
THEIR
PLACE
IN
THE
BODY
MAYBE
I
SHOULD
DEFINE
EXTROVERTINTROVERT
MORE
CAREFULLY
SINCE
THESE
WORDS
ARE
USUALLY
NOT
USED
CORRECTLY
IN
OUR
CULTURE
THE
EXTROVERTINTROVERT
SCALE
IS
A
MEASURE
OF
HOW
A
PERSON
IS
ENERGIZED
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
EXCERPTED
FROM
MY
SUMMARY
ENERGIZING
HOW
A
PERSON
IS
ENERGIZED
EXTROVERSION
E
PREFERENCE
FOR
DRAWING
ENERGY
FROM
THE
OUTSIDE
WORLD
OF
PEOPLE
ACTIVITIES
OR
THINGS
INTROVERSION
I
PREFERENCE
FOR
DRAWING
ENERGY
FROM
ONES
INTERNAL
WORLD
OF
IDEAS
EMOTIONS
OR
IMPRESSIONS
HOPEFULLY
THIS
WILL
ELICIT
FURTHER
DISCUSSION
AS
TO
HOW
CHURCHES
CAN
STRUCTURE
THEMSELVES
TO
MEET
THE
REAL
NEEDS
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
COMPRISE
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
INSTEAD
OF
TRYING
TO
CHANGE
PEOPLES
PERSONALITIES
TO
FIT
THEM
INTO
A
PARTICULAR
FRAMEWORK
IM
SURE
THERE
ARE
OTHER
ASPECTS
OF
HOW
CHURCHES
HAVE
NOT
PROPERLY
UNDERSTOOD
PERSONALITY
VARIANCES
AMONG
THEIR
MEMBERS

DETRIMENT
