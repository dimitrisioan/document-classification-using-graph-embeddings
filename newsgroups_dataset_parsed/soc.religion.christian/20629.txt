WRITES
HI
ALL
HOPE
YOU
ALL
HAD
A
BLESSED
EASTER
I
HAVE
A
DOCUMENT
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
REFUTES
THE
NOTION
THAT
THE
SSPX
SOCIETY
OF
SAINT
PIUS
X
IS
IN
SCHISM
OR
THAT
THERE
HAS
BEEN
ANY
LEGITIMATE
EXCOMMUNICATION
IF
ANYONE
IS
INTERESTED
IN
READING
THE
TRUTH
ABOUT
THIS
MATTER
PLEASE
EMAIL
ME
AND
ILL
SEND
THEM
THE
DOCUMENT
VIA
EMAIL
ITS
PAGES
LONG
SO
I
WONT
BE
POSTING
IT
ON
THE
NEWS
GROUP
I
MAY
BE
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
SOME
BRIEF
SELECTIONS
POSTED
TO
THE
NET
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THAT
SSPX
DOES
NOT
CONSIDER
ITSELF
IN
SCHISM
OR
LEGITIMATELY
EXCOMMUNICATED
BUT
THATS
REALLY
BESIDE
THE
POINT
WHAT
DOES
THE
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
SAY
EXCOMMUNICATION
CAN
BE
REAL
APART
FROM
FORMAL
EXCOMMUNICATION
AS
PROVIDED
FOR
IN
CANON
LAW
AFTER
ALL
WE
ORTHODOX
DONT
CINSIDER
OURSELVES
SCHISMATIC
OR
EXCOMMUNICATED
BUT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
CONSIDERS
US
DISSIDENT
IF
THIS
IS
INAPPROPRIATE
FOR
THIS
GROUP
OR
BEYOND
THE
CHARTER
IM
SURE
OFM
WILL
LET
US
KNOW

I
THINK
ITS
WITHIN
THE
CHARTER
WHETHER
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
THE
BEST
GROUP
IN
WHICH
TO
DISCUSS
IT
IS
UP
TO
THE
PEOPLE
CONCERNED
I
AM
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
HAVING
THIS
REINVOKE
THE
GENERAL
CATHOLICPROTESTANT
POLEMICS
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
IT
SHOULD
THE
ISSUE
IS
PRIMARILY
ONE
SPECIFIC
TO
CATHOLICS
