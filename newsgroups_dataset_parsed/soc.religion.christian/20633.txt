i
realize
im
entering
this
discussion
rather
late
but
i
do
have
one
question
wasnt
it
a
reagan
appointee
james
watt
a
pentacostal
christian
i
think
who
was
the
secretary
of
the
interior
who
saw
no
problem
with
deforestation
since
we
were
living
in
the
last
days
and
ours
would
be
the
last
generation
to
see
the
redwoods
anyway
i
heard
the
same
thing
but
without
confirmation
that
he
actually
said
it
it
was
just
as
alarming
to
us
as
to
you
the
bible
says
that
nobody
knows
when
the
second
coming
will
take
place
michael
a
covington
i
do
recall
watt
making
a
comment
to
this
effect
though
it
was
quite
a
few
years
back
and
i
cant
cite
the
specifics
i
also
recall
that
cecil
andrus
who
was
secretary
of
the
interior
during
the
carter
administration
responded
to
watts
comments
by
pointing
out
the
stewardship
role
that
god
gave
to
man
as
recorded
in
genesis
which
makes
me
wonder
who
are
the
true
conservatives
it
seems
to
me
that
a
conservative
should
want
to
conserve
things
of
value
for
longterm
societal
benefit
this
form
of
conservation
should
logically
extend
to
the
physical
environment
in
which
people
live
as
well
as
the
moral
environment
in
which
they
relate
to
one
another
and
to
god
imho
watts
stewardship
status
is
not
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
he
served
on
the
board
of
directors
for
jim
bakkers
organization
during
a
time
in
which
bakker
committed
criminal
acts
which
eventually
landed
bakker
in
federal
prison
