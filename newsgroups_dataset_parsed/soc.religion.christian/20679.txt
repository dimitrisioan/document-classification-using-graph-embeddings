REVELATIONS
BABYLON
HELLO
ALL
WE
ARE
DOING
A
BIBLE
STUDY
AT
MY
COLLEGE
ON
REVELATIONS
WE
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
PRETTY
GOOD
AS
FAR
AS
GETTING
SOME
SORT
OF
REASONABLE
INTERPRETATION
WE
ARE
NOW
ON
CHAPTERS
AND
WHICH
TALK
ABOUT
THE
WOMAN
ON
THE
BEAST
AND
THE
FALL
OF
BABYLON
I
BELIEVE
THE
BEAST
IS
THE
ANTICHRIST
SOME
MAY
DIFFER
BUT
IT
SEEMS
OBVIOUS
AND
THE
WOMAN
REPRESENTS
BABYLON
WHICH
STANDS
FOR
ROME
OR
THE
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
WHAT
ARE
SOME
VIEWS
ON
THIS
INTERPRETATION
IS
THE
FALLING
BABYLON
IN
CHAPTER
THE
SAME
BABYLON
IN
AS
IN
CHAPTER
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
HATE
TO
STEP
ON
TOES

READING
THIS
IMAGERY
AS
THE
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
WAS
CERTAINLY
COMMON
IN
EARLIER
PROTESTANT
WRITERS
A
LOT
OF
US
FIND
THAT
FRANKLY
EMBARASSING
NOW
THOUGH
SOME
OF
OUR
READERS
WILL
CERTAINLY
ADVOCATE
SUCH
A
POSITION
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
DESCRIPTION
MAKES
IT
LOOK
A
LOT
LIKE
A
POLITICAL
ENTITY
ITS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
KINGS
CONTROLS
WORLD
COMMERCE
IS
SEATED
ON
SEVEN
MOUNTAINS
RECALL
THAT
ROME
IS
TRADITIONALLY
REGARDED
AS
BUILT
ON
SEVEN
HILLS
IF
ITS
A
CHURCH
THEN
ITS
NOT
THE
CURRENT
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
BUT
A
CHURCH
THAT
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
OVER
BY
THE
ANTICHRIST
AND
MERGED
WITH
THE
STATE
TURNING
INTO
SOMETHING
RATHER
DIFFERENT
THAN
IT
IS
NOW
PRESUMABLY
IN
SUCH
A
SCENARIO
THE
TRUE
CATHOLICS
ARE
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
ARE
PERSECUTED
GIVEN
THE
OVERALL
IMPRESSION
THAT
SATAN
IS
PRETENDING
TO
BE
AN
ANGEL
OF
LIGHT
AND
THE
TRUE
CHURCH
IS
A
PERSECUTED
REMNANT
I
THINK
THE
MOST
CONSISTENT
PLAYING
OUT
OF
THE
IMAGE
WOULD
BE
THAT
THE
ANTICHRIST
WOULD
BE
PRESIDING
OVER
A
CHURCH
THAT
CLAIMS
TO
BE
THE
HEIR
OF
BOTH
THE
PROTESTANT
AND
CATHOLIC
TRADITIONS
BUT
THAT
THE
TRUE
SPIRITUAL
DESCENDANTS
OF
BOTH
PETER
AND
THE
REFORMERS
ARE
EQUALLY
BEING
PERSECUTED
