satan
and
mtv
somewhere
someone
told
me
that
satan
was
the
angel
in
charge
of
music
in
heaven
and
on
top
of
that
he
was
the
most
beautiful
of
the
angels
isnt
it
funny
that
these
days
how
mtv
has
become
the
bible
of
music
and
beauty
these
days
mtv
controls
what
bands
are
popular
no
matter
how
bad
they
are
in
fact
it
is
better
to
be
politically
correct
like
madonna
than
to
have
any
musical
talent
then
of
course
you
have
this
television
station
that
tells
us
all
how
to
dress
think
about
it
who
started
the
retrofashion
craze
mtv
and
madonna
gag
anyway
just
food
for
thought
it
is
really
my
own
wierd
theory
if
revelation
was
to
come
true
today
i
think
mtv
would
the
ever
changing
waters
music
and
fashion
world
that
the
beast
would
arise
from
and
madonna
will
be
the
whore
of
babylon
riding
the
beast
and
drinking
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
hmmmmgreat
idea
for
a
bookmovie
steven
c
salaris
werea
lot
more
dangerous
than
live
crew
and
their
stupid
use
of
foul
language
because
we
have
ideas
we
have
a
philosophy
