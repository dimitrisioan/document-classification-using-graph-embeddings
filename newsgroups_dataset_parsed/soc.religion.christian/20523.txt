well
my
son
the
best
advice
i
can
give
you
is
this
eat
a
lot
of
carrots
oh
do
you
really
think
that
will
work
and
should
it
be
before
or
after
intercourse
instead

disclaimer
as
a
single
catholic
i
didnt
have
any
business
to
post
this
kind
of
joke
to
this
group
so
if
you
found
it
inappropriate
but
what
was
wrong
with
it
it
wont
tempt
anyone
to
any
kind
of
sin
as
far
as
i
can
tell
it
doesnt
belittle
anyone
it
does
not
substitute
offensiveness
for
humor
its
genuinely
funny
we
shouldnt
assume
that
all
jokes
that
mention
sexuality
are
dirty
merely
because
so
many
are
and
we
should
never
mistake
prudery
for
spirituality
it
can
be
the
direct
opposite
a
symptom
of
the
lack
of
a
healthy
perspective
on
gods
