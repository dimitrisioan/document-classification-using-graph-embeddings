the
question
is
how
do
they
interpret
these
verses
we
must
now
establish
reasons
for
not
believing
this
to
be
true
based
on
the
interpretation
of
these
scriptures
given
by
someone
who
has
come
to
grips
with
them
i
see
no
other
way
of
interpreting
them
other
than
homosexuyality
being
wrong
please
tell
me
how
these
verses
can
be
interpreted
in
any
other
way
i
read
them
and
the
surrounding
text
in
christs
