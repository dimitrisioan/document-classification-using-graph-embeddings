RE
WHY
DO
PEOPLE
BECOME
ATHEISTS
IN
ARTICLE
NOYEMIDWAYUCHICAGOEDU
WRITES
CHRISTIANS
CAN
ALSO
FEEL
THAT
SENSE
OF
DIFFERENCE
HOWEVER
WHEN
THEY
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THOSE
WEIRD
TELEVANGELISTS
WHO
ALWAYS
TALK
ABOUT
SATAN
IF
YOULL
EXCUSE
THE
CLICHED
SOUND
OF
THIS
EVERYONE
HAS
TO
DEAL
WITH
HIS
HER
DIFFERENCES
FROM
OTHER
PEOPLE
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
HOW
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
COULD
BE
HARD
FOR
YOU
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
IS
SOMETIMES
HARD
FOR
ME
THIS
IS
NOT
AT
ALL
COMPARABLE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
THE
MAIN
STREAM
IN
WESTERN
CULTURE
YOU
ARE
TRIVIALIZING
THE
EXPERIENCES
OF
OTHERS
I
REMEMBER
WHAT
IT
WAS
LIKE
BEING
DIFFERENT
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
WE
WERE
TOLD
ALL
THE
TIME
THAT
WE
WERE
DIFFERENT
AND
IN
FACT
THAT
ONLY
MEMBERS
OF
THE
OUR
CHURCH
WERE
REALLY
CHRISTIANS
THOUGH
OTHERS
WHO
BELIEVED
IN
GOD
WERENT
AS
BAD
AS
ATHEISTS
SO
WE
WERE
A
SMALL
MINORITY
THAT
WAS
NOTHING
COMPARED
TO
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
THE
ONLY
THING
COMPARABLE
WOULD
BE
A
YOUNG
CHILD
BEING
CHRISTIAN
BEING
SURROUNDED
BY
STAUNCH
ATHEISTS
INCLUDING
PARENTS
WHO
ACTIVELY
PERSECUTE
ANY
RELIGIOUS
TENDANCIES
BOTH
ACTUAL
PUNISHMENTS
AND
EVEN
WORSE
EMOTIONAL
BLACKMAIL
THEY
WOULD
ALSO
HAVE
TO
HAVE
THE
WHOLE
MAINSTREAM
SOCIETY
ON
THEIR
SIDE
MAYBE
THESE
CONDITIONS
COULD
HAVE
OCCURED
IN
THE
OLD
SOVIET
UNION
NOT
IN
A
COUNTRY
WITH
UNDER
GOD
IN
ITS
PLEDGE
OF
ALLEGIANCE
I
DOUBT
IT
EVEN
THEN
BECAUSE
CHILDREN
HAVE
TO
BE
TAUGHT
TO
BE
CHRISTIANS
AND
HENCE
MUST
HAVE
SUPPORT
SOMEWHERE
I
HAVE
SYMPATHY
FOR
GAYS
GROWING
UP
IN
REPRESSIVE
ENVIRONMENTS
AND
HAVING
TO
HIDE
AND
SOMETIMES
AT
FIRST
TRY
TO
DENY
A
PART
OF
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
IVE
BEEN
THERE
ONLY
IN
MY
CASE
IT
WAS
MY
RATIONALITY
INSTEAD
OF
SEXUALITY
WHICH
I
WAS
FORCED
TO
TRY
TO
REPRESS
IN
SOME
WAY
THE
PRESSURES
WERE
DIFFERENT
OF
COURSE
BECAUSE
YOU
CHOSE
YOUR
BELIEFS
OR
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
YOUR
CHOICE
BUT
BORN
OF
NECESSITY
PLEASE
NO
FLAMES
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
GAY
PEOPLE
CHOOSE
THEIR
LIFESTYLE
THATS
ELSEWHERE
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
YES
MY
ATHEISM
WAS
BORN
OF
NECESSITY
FOR
AN
INTELLECTUALLY
HONEST
PERSON
BELIEF
IS
MOSTLY
A
RESPONSE
TO
EVIDENCE
WILL
OR
WISHES
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
I
COULD
CHOOSE
TO
LIE
OR
TO
BE
SILENT
ABOUT
MY
TRUE
BELIEFS
I
COULD
NO
MORE
CHOOSE
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
GOD
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THAN
I
COULD
DECIDE
THAT
THE
ORDINARY
SKY
LOOKS
RED
TO
ME
STILL
I
SHOULD
BE
CLEAR
THAT
IM
NOT
EQUATING
WHAT
I
WENT
THROUGH
WITH
WHAT
GAYS
GO
THROUGH
HOWEVER
IT
IS
A
MISTAKE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
EVERYONE
WHO
GOES
THROUGH
PAINFUL
EXPERIENCES
ARE
BROKEN
BY
THEM
HAPPILY
SOME
ARE
MADE
STRONGER
ONCE
WE
GET
PAST
IT
I
MUST
SAY
THAT
I
WASNT
HURT
BY
MY
EXPERIENCES
IN
CHURCH
ANY
MORE
THAN
SOME
OF
MY
FRIENDS
WHO
DIDNT
BECOME
ATHEISTS
I
WAS
JUST
HURT
DIFFERENTLY
IM
NOT
SURE
I
UNDERSTAND
THIS
SENTENCE
COULD
YOU
EXPLAIN
NOT
WITHOUT
GOING
TO
DETAILS
AND
VIOLATING
THE
CONFIDENCES
OF
SOME
OF
MY
CHILDHOOD
FRIENDS
SUFFICE
IT
SAY
TO
THAT
RELIGION
DOES
NOT
GUARANTEE
THAT
A
PERSON
WILL
BE
HAPPY
AND
STRONG
EMOTIONALLY
AND
A
REPRESSIVE
UPBRINGING
CAN
LEAVE
ITS
SCARS
EVEN
OR
ESPECIALLY
ON
THOSE
WHO
DONT
GET
FREE
OF
IT
I
DOUBT
THAT
ANY
SANE
AND
SINCERE
PERSON
DOUBTS
THAT
AND
I
FEEL
NO
NEED
TO
DEFEND
IT
BY
THE
WAY
I
AM
MUCH
HAPPIER
AND
STRONGER
BEING
OUT
OF
THE
CLOSET
IN
THE
END
IT
HAS
BEEN
AS
SOMEONE
ELOQUENTLY
PUT
IT
IN
PRIVATE
EMAIL
AN
EXPERIENCE
OF
LIBERATION
RATHER
THAN
DISILLUSION
