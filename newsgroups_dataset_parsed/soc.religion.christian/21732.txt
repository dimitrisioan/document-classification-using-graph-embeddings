it
troubles
me
that
there
have
been
so
many
posts
recently
trying
to
support
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
this
is
primarily
a
catholic
doctrine
with
no
other
purpose
than
to
defend
the
idea
of
infant
baptism
if
you
read
all
of
ezekiel
you
will
see
that
god
doesnt
hold
us
guilty
for
anyone
elses
sins
so
we
can
have
no
original
guilt
from
adam
this
neatly
eliminates
the
need
for
a
savior
and
proves
that
we
can
be
saved
by
works
alone
if
we
have
no
original
sin
then
it
is
possible
for
us
to
save
ourselves
by
not
sinning
i
understand
the
reasoning
behind
your
argument
but
it
leads
to
sheer
folly
original
sin
is
the
reason
we
need
faith
to
be
saved
