RE
WHAT
WAS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
RAGRACAVELAACSOAKLANDEDU
RANDY
A
GRACA
WRITES
CONSEQUENTLY
THIS
VERSE
INDICATES
THAT
SHE
WAS
WITHOUT
SIN
ALSO
AS
WAS
OBSERVED
AT
THE
VERY
TOP
OF
THIS
POST
MARY
HAD
TO
BE
FREE
FROM
SIN
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
THE
MOTHER
OF
JESUS
WHO
WAS
DEFINITELY
WITHOUT
SIN
IF
THE
MOTHER
OF
JESUS
HAD
TO
BE
WITHOUT
SIN
IN
ORDER
TO
GIVE
BIRTH
TO
GOD
THEN
WHY
DIDNT
MARYS
MOTHER
HAVE
TO
BE
WITHOUT
SIN
IN
ORDER
TO
GIVE
BIRTH
TO
THE
PERFECT
VESSEL
FOR
JESUS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WHY
DIDNT
MARYS
GRANDMOTHER
HAVE
TO
BE
WITHOUT
SIN
EITHER
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WITH
ALL
THE
ORIGINAL
SIN
FLOWING
THROUGH
EACH
PERSON
THE
NEED
FOR
THE
LAST
ONE
MARY
TO
HAVE
NONE
PUTS
GOD
IN
A
BOX
WHERE
WE
SAY
THAT
HE
COULDNT
HAVE
INCARNATED
HIMSELF
THROUGH
A
NORMAL
HUMAN
BEING
MY
GOD
IS
AN
ALL
POWERFUL
GOD
WHO
CAN
DO
WHATEVER
SUITS
HIS
PURPOSE
THIS
INCLUDES
CREATING
A
SOLAR
SYSTEM
AND
PLANET
EARTH
WITH
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
GREAT
AGE
PROVIDING
A
PATH
THROUGH
THE
RED
SEA
FOR
THE
CHILDREN
OF
ISRAEL
THAT
DOES
NOT
DEPEND
ON
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
RIDGE
OF
HIGH
GROUND
AND
A
WIND
BLOWING
AT
THE
RIGHT
SPEED
AND
DIRECTION
AND
THE
BIRTH
OF
HIMSELF
FROM
A
NORMAL
SINFUL
PERSON
WITHOUT
BEING
TAINTED
BY
HER
ORIGINAL
SIN
I
SEE
FAR
TOO
MUCH
FOCUS
ON
THE
OBJECTS
OF
RELIGION
AND
NOT
NEARLY
ENOUGH
ON
THE
PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP
THAT
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
ALL
BELIEVERS
WITH
THE
AUTHOR
OF
OUR
EXISTENCE
WITHOUT
THE
NECESSITY
OF
HAVING
THIS
RELATIONSHIP
CHANNELED
THROUGH
CONDUITS
TO
GOD
IN
THE
FORM
OF
MARY
APOSTLES
AND
A
POPE
NOTE
THAT
THE
IDEA
OF
MARY
BEING
CONCEIVED
WITHOUT
ORIGINAL
SIN
IE
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
IS
DISTINCT
FROM
THE
IDEA
OF
MARY
NOT
HAVING
SINNED
DURING
HER
LIFETIME
WHICH
IS
A
SEPARATE
DOCTRINE
AND
I
BELIEVE
ALSO
HELD
BY
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
IF
MARY
WAS
BORN
WITHOUT
ORIGINAL
SIN
AND
DIDNT
SIN
DURING
HER
LIFETIME
HOW
IS
SHE
ANY
DIFFERENT
FROM
JESUS
THIS
MEANS
THE
WORLD
HAS
HAD
TWO
PERFECT
HUMANS
ONE
DIED
TO
TAKE
AWAY
THE
SINS
OF
THE
WORLD
THE
OTHER
GAVE
BIRTH
TO
HIM
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
WANT
TO
SEE
SOME
SCRIPTURAL
SUPPORT
FOR
THIS
BEFORE
I
WOULD
START
PRAYING
TO
ANYONE
OTHER
THAN
GOD
EVERYTHING
I
HAVE
EVER
READ
FROM
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
ME
THAT
JESUS
WAS
AND
IS
THE
ONLY
SINLESS
LAMB
OF
GOD
NOT
HIS
MOTHER
GRANDMOTHER
HOPE
THIS
IS
USEFUL
TO
YOU
VERY
USEFUL
IN
HELPING
ME
UNDERSTAND
SOME
OF
THE
RC
BELIEFS
