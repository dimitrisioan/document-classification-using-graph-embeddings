STRYDOM
WRITES
WHICH
BRINGS
ME
AROUND
TO
ASKING
AN
OPEN
QUESTION
IS
THE
BIBLE
A
CLOSED
BOOK
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
IT
OKAY
FOR
US
TO
GO
AROUND
SAYING
GOD
TOLD
ME
THIS
AND
JESUS
TOLD
ME
THAT
WOULDNT
THAT
IMPLY
THAT
GOD
IS
STILL
POURING
OUT
NEW
REVELATION
TO
US
I
KNOW
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
FEEL
THAT
IS
OKAY
AND
SOME
WILL
NOT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
CLOSED
CANON
WOULD
CERTAINLY
CAST
A
SHADOW
ON
CONTEMPORARY
PROPHETS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
AN
OPEN
CANON
SEEMS
TO
BE
INDICATED
SOMETIMES
LETS
GET
BACK
TO
BASICS
CANON
FROM
THE
LATIN
MEANS
A
RULE
IF
WE
SAY
THAT
A
RULE
IS
OPEN
THEN
ITS
A
RULE
MADE
TO
BE
BROKEN
THERE
IS
AN
ISSUE
ALSO
OF
MEASUREMENT
AGAINST
A
RULE
THUS
THE
WORDS
THAT
ARE
SPOKEN
NEED
TO
BE
COMPARED
AGAINST
THE
RULECANON
BUT
NOT
ADDED
TO
THE
CANON
IS
NEW
REVELATION
NECESSARY
TOPICAL
CURRENT
PERSONAL
REVELATION
ID
SAY
IS
NECESSARY
NEW
REVELATION
FOR
ALL
PEOPLE
FOR
ALL
TIMES
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
AS
WE
HAVE
THAT
IN
SCRIPTURE
YOU
ALSO
SEEM
TO
CONFUSE
CANON
WITH
SCRIPTURE
SCRIPTURE
MAY
SPEAK
OF
ITSELF
BEING
OPEN
IE
GOD
SPEAKING
TODAY
IT
WOULD
SPEAK
THAT
IT
IS
CLOSED
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
THE
CANON
IS
UNCHANGEABLE
THOUGH
THE
CONCEPT
OF
CANON
IS
LATER
HISTORICALLY
ALSO
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
IS
THAT
SOME
SO
CALLED
PROPHECIES
ARE
NOTHING
NEW
BUT
RATHER
AN
INSPIRED
TRANSLATION
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
IT
RIGHT
TO
CALL
THAT
PROPHECY
MISLEADING
WOULDNT
THAT
BE
MORE
HAVING
TO
DO
WITH
KNOWLEDGE
I
KNOW
THE
GIFT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
EXCITING
TO
TALK
ABOUT
BUT
SHOULDNT
WE
CALL
A
HORSE
A
HORSE
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
PROBLEM
OF
CONFUSION
IF
PROPHECY
IS
MEANT
TO
ENCOURAGE
EXHORT
OR
CORRECT
THEN
IS
AN
OVERLAP
WITH
SCRIPTURE
IF
PROPHECY
IS
MEANT
TO
BRING
A
WORD
OF
THE
FORM
THE
MAN
YOU
LIVE
WITH
IS
NOT
YOUR
HUSBAND
THEN
THAT
IS
KNOWLEDGE
YET
THE
EXACT
WORDS
THEIR
ARE
SCRIPTURE
I
WOULD
EXPECT
THE
DIFFERENCE
TO
BE
THE
MOTIVE
AND
MEANS
FOR
DELIVERY
THE
READING
OF
SCRIPTURE
ITSELF
CAN
BE
A
POWERFUL
FORCE
