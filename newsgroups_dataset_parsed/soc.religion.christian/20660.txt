RE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
SOMEONE
SENT
ME
THIS
FAQ
BY
EMAIL
AND
I
POST
MY
RESPONSE
HERE
IM
NOT
ENFORCING
THE
INCLUSION
LIMITS
ON
THIS
FAQ
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
OUR
READERS
PROBABLY
HAVENT
SEEN
IT
CLH
CHRIST
WARNS
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
BREAKS
ONE
OF
THE
LEAST
OF
THESE
COMMANDMENTS
AND
TEACHES
OTHERES
TO
DO
THE
SAME
WILL
BE
CALLED
LEAST
IN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
MATT
THIS
FAQ
IS
SO
FULL
OF
ERROR
THAT
I
MUST
RESPOND
TO
IT
I
HOPE
THAT
WHOEVER
MAINTAINS
WILL
REMOVE
FROM
IT
THE
PARTISAN
THEOLOGY
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
BEING
NEW
TO
THE
FAITH
AND
EXAMINING
THE
DECALOGUE
CLOSELY
IVE
NOTICED
THE
FOURTH
COMMANDMENT
IS
PRETTY
SPECIFIC
ABOUT
KEEPING
THE
SABBATH
DAY
IT
STATES
THE
DAY
SATURDAY
IS
THE
SABBATH
WHILE
MOST
CHRISTIAN
RELIGIONS
KEEP
OR
ATLEAST
GO
TO
CHURCH
ON
SUNDAY
WHATS
UP
THIS
IS
A
FREQUENTLY
ASKED
QUESTION
EVERY
TIME
IT
ARISES
IT
CAUSES
MONTHS
OF
DEBATE
SO
LET
ME
SEE
IF
I
CAN
ANSWER
YOU
DIRECTLY
BASICALLY
ITS
BECAUSE
THE
LAW
WAS
GIVEN
TO
MOSES
AS
PART
OF
A
SPECIFIC
COVENANENT
WITH
THE
JEWS
MOST
OF
US
ARENT
JEWS
SO
WE
ARENT
PART
OF
THAT
COVENANT
THERE
WAS
AN
ARGUMENT
EARLY
IN
CHRISTIAN
HISTORY
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
MOSAIC
LAWS
SHOULD
APPLY
TO
GENTILES
WHO
BECAME
CHRISTIANS
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
ACCOUNT
OF
THIS
DEBATE
IN
ACTS
THE
MAIN
QUESTION
THERE
WAS
CIRCUMCISION
BUT
KEEPING
THE
SABBATH
WOULD
BE
PART
OF
IT
AS
WELL
THE
APOSTLES
CONCLUDED
THAT
WE
NEED
NOT
BECOME
JEWS
IN
ORDER
TO
BECOME
CHRISTIANS
AND
THEREFORE
THAT
RULES
SUCH
AS
CIRCUMCISION
DID
NOT
APPLY
TO
US
THE
LAW
WAS
KNOWN
TO
MAN
BEFORE
IT
WAS
REVEALED
ON
MOUNT
SINAI
ROM
NOTES
THAT
WHERE
NO
LAW
IS
THERE
IS
NO
TRANSGRESSION
NOT
ONLY
DID
SIN
EXIST
BEFORE
SINAI
EDEN
BUT
THE
SABBATH
WAS
KEPT
BEFORE
IT
WAS
REVEALED
ON
SINAI
EX
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
FIRST
COVENANT
WAS
NOT
THE
LAW
BUT
THE
PROMISE
WHICH
UNDERGIRDED
IT
GOD
WANTED
TO
PERFORM
HIS
WILL
IN
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
BUT
IN
THEIR
IGNORANCE
AFTER
YEARS
OF
SLAVERY
THEY
PROMISED
WHAT
EVER
HE
SAYS
TO
DO
WE
WILL
DO
THAT
IS
WHY
THE
NEW
COVENANT
IS
BASED
ON
BETTER
PROMISES
HEB
RATHER
THAN
DO
AWAY
WITH
THE
LAW
GOD
PROMISED
TO
PUT
MY
LAWS
IN
THEIR
MINDS
AND
WRITE
THEM
ON
THEIR
HEARTS
HEB
INCLUDING
THE
SABBATH
IN
THE
ACTS
IS
SELECTIVE
INCLUSION
THE
SABBATH
WAS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
THE
JEWS
THAN
CIRCUMCISION
IF
ANY
ATTEMPT
HAD
BEEN
MADE
TO
DO
AWAY
WITH
THE
SABBATH
THE
REACTION
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EVEN
MORE
STRIDENT
THAN
IS
RECORDED
IN
ACTS
DO
NOT
CONFUSE
THE
WEEKLY
SABBATH
OF
THE
DECALOGUE
WITH
THE
CEREMONIAL
SABBATHS
WHICH
COULD
OCCUR
AT
ANY
TIME
OF
THE
WEEK
AND
WERE
PART
OF
THE
LAW
CEREMONIAL
WHICH
WAS
ADDED
BECAUSE
OF
TRANSGRESSION
OF
THE
MORAL
LAW
GAL
ISRAEL
STANDS
FOR
GODS
PEOPLE
OF
ALL
TIME
THAT
IS
WHY
GOD
GRAFTED
THE
GENTILES
IN
ROMA
SAYS
THAT
THE
ADOPTION
THE
GLORY
THE
COVENANTS
THE
GIVING
OF
THE
LAW
THE
SERVICE
OF
GOD
AND
THE
PROMISES
BELONG
TO
ISRAELITES
IN
EXPLANATION
PAUL
MAKES
IT
CLEAR
THAT
BEING
BORN
INTO
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
FOR
THEY
ARE
NOT
ALL
ISRAEL
WHICH
ARE
OF
ISRAEL
V
THEN
IN
GAL
HE
SAYS
IF
YE
BE
CHRISTS
THEN
ARE
YE
ABRAHAMS
SEED
AND
HEIRS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
PROMISE
ALL
CHRISTIANS
ARE
ABRAHAMS
SEED
JEWS
ISRAELITES
NOT
PHYSICALLY
FOR
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
CRITERION
BUT
SPIRITUALLY
WE
ARE
JOINT
HEIRS
WITH
JESUS
BASED
ON
THE
PROMISE
GOD
MADE
TO
ALL
HIS
PEOPLE
THE
ISRAELITES
WHILE
CHRISTIANS
AGREE
THAT
THE
OT
LAWS
DO
NOT
ALL
APPLY
TO
US
BECAUSE
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
PART
OF
A
SPECIFIC
COVENANENT
WITH
THE
JEWS
WE
ALSO
EXPECT
TO
SEE
SOME
SIMILARITY
BETWEEN
THE
THINGS
GOD
EXPECTED
FROM
THE
JEWS
AND
THE
THINGS
HE
EXPECTS
FROM
US
AFTER
ALL
ITS
THE
SAME
GOD
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
WAYS
OF
DEALING
WITH
THIS
THESE
DAYS
THE
MOST
COMMON
APPROACH
IS
TO
SEPARATE
THE
OT
COMMANDMENTS
INTO
MORAL
AND
CEREMONIAL
CEREMONIAL
COMMANDMENTS
APPLY
ONLY
TO
THE
JEWS
THEY
ARE
PART
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
MOSAIC
COVENANT
THESE
ARE
THINSG
LIKE
THE
KOSHER
LAWS
AND
CIRCUMCISION
MORAL
LAWS
APPLY
TO
EVERYONE
MOST
OF
THE
COMMANDS
ARE
PART
OF
THE
MORAL
LAW
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
COMMANDMENT
ABOUT
THE
SABBATH
I
BELIEVE
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
TAKE
THIS
APPROACH
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THE
SPECIFIC
REQUIREMENT
TO
WORSHIP
ON
THE
SABBATH
IS
PART
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
BUT
A
GENERAL
OBLIGATION
TO
WORSHIP
REGULARLY
IS
PART
OF
THE
GENERAL
MORAL
LAW
THUS
CHRISTIANS
ARE
FREE
TO
CHOOSE
THE
SPECIFIC
TIME
WE
WORSHIP
PEOPLE
WOULD
PROBABLY
AGREE
BUT
THEY
ARE
WRONG
HOW
CAN
THE
SABBATH
COMMANDMENT
BE
CEREMONIAL
WHEN
IT
IS
PART
OF
A
LAW
WHICH
PREDATES
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAWS
YOU
ARE
NOT
FREE
TO
CHOOSE
YOUR
TIME
OF
WORSHIP
EVEN
IF
YOU
WERE
WHY
DO
YOU
FOLLOW
A
DAY
OF
WORSHIP
WHICH
HAS
ITS
ORIGINS
IN
PAGAN
SUN
WORSHIP
WOULD
YOU
RATHER
GIVE
UP
A
DAY
WHICH
GOD
BLESSED
SANCTIFIED
AND
HALLOWED
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
ONE
WHICH
ALL
CHURCH
LEADERS
AGREE
HAS
NOT
BIBLICAL
FOUNDATION
SEE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
IN
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIANBIBLESTUDY
A
MORE
RADICAL
APPROACH
WHICH
IS
GENERALLY
CONNECTED
WITH
JOHN
CALVIN
AND
THE
REFORMED
TRADITION
SAYS
THAT
THE
LAW
AS
A
WHOLE
IS
NO
LONGER
BINDING
INSTEAD
WE
ARE
ENTIRELY
UNDER
GRACE
AND
OUR
BEHAVIOR
SHOULD
BE
GUIDED
SOLELY
BY
LOVE
PORTIONS
OF
THE
OT
LAW
ARE
STILL
USEFUL
AS
GUIDANCE
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
PROPERLY
SPEAKING
LEGALLY
BINDING
ON
US
IN
PRACTICE
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
TAKE
THIS
POSITION
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IT
IS
SAFE
TO
LEAVE
CHRISTIANS
WITHOUT
MORAL
GUIDANNCE
WHILE
WE
MAY
NO
LONGER
BE
UNDER
LAW
AS
SINNERS
ITS
NOT
SAFE
FOR
US
TO
GO
INTO
SITUATIONS
WITH
NO
PRINCIPLES
TO
GUIDE
US
WERE
TOO
GOOD
AT
SELFJUSTIFICATION
FOR
THAT
TO
BE
SAFE
THUS
CHRISTIANS
DO
HAVE
MORAL
GUIDANCE
FROM
THINGS
LIKE
JESUS
TEACHINGS
PAULS
ADVICE
ETC
THESE
MAY
NOT
BE
PRECISELY
A
LAW
BUT
THEY
SERVE
MUCH
THE
SAME
FUNCTION
AS
AND
HAVE
LARGELY
THE
SAME
CONTENT
AS
THE
MORAL
LAW
IN
THE
PREVIOUS
ANALYSIS
WHILE
CALVIN
WOULD
DENY
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
FIXED
LEGAL
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
WORSHIP
ON
ANY
SPECIFIC
DAY
HE
WOULD
SAY
THAT
GIVEN
HUMAN
WEAKNESS
THE
DISCIPLINE
OF
REGULAR
WORSHIP
IS
IMPORTANT
I
DO
NOT
CARE
WHAT
CALVIN
OR
ANY
THEOLOGIAN
SAYS
MY
GUIDE
IS
WHAT
GOD
SAYS
IF
BEING
NOT
UNDER
THE
LAW
MEANS
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
KEEP
THE
LAW
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
THE
ONLY
SECTION
OF
THE
LAW
WE
HAVE
TROUBLE
WITH
IS
THE
SABBATH
COMMANDMENT
WHICH
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
GOD
THOUGHT
WAS
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
REMEMBER
IF
YOU
STUDY
THE
WORD
DEEPLY
YOU
WILL
NOTE
THAT
THE
MESSAGE
IS
THAT
WE
ARE
NO
LONGER
UNDER
THE
CONDEMNATION
OF
THE
LAW
BUT
FREED
BY
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
IF
A
COP
PULLS
ME
OVER
FOR
SPEEDING
THEN
IN
COURT
I
ASK
FOR
MERCY
AND
THE
JUDGE
DOES
NOT
THROW
THE
BOOK
AT
ME
BUT
GIVES
ME
GRACE
DO
I
WALK
OUT
OF
THE
COURT
SAYING
I
CAN
NOW
GO
ON
SPEEDING
FOR
I
AM
NOW
UNDER
GRACE
BEING
UNDER
GRACE
I
NOW
DRIVE
WITHIN
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
PAUL
ADDS
TO
IT
IN
ROM
DI
WE
THEN
MAKE
VOID
THE
LAW
THROUGH
FAITH
GOD
FORBID
YEA
WE
ESTABLISH
THE
LAW
WHEREFORE
THE
LAW
IS
HOLY
AND
THE
COMMANDMENT
HOLY
AND
JUST
AND
GOOD
ROM
IN
BOTH
ANALYSES
THE
SPECIFIC
DAY
IS
NOT
AN
ISSUE
AS
A
MATTER
OF
TRADITION
WE
WORSHIP
ON
SUNDAY
AS
A
MEMORIAL
OF
CHRISTS
RESURRECTION
THERES
SOME
DEBATE
ABOUT
WHAT
ACTS
SHOWS
ABOUT
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
THE
MOST
COMMON
ANALYSIS
IS
THAT
IS
SHOWS
JEWISH
CHRISTIANS
CONTINUING
TO
GO
TO
JEWISH
SERVICES
ON
THE
SABBATH
BUT
THAT
SPECIFICALLY
CHRISTIAN
SERVICE
WERE
NOT
NECESSARILY
HELD
THEN
ACT
SHOWS
WORSHIP
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
SUNDAY
AND
I
COR
ALSO
IMPLIES
GATHERINGS
ON
THAT
DAY
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
GROUPS
THAT
CONTINUE
TO
BELIEVE
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
TO
WORSHIP
ON
THE
SABBATH
SATURDAY
THE
BESTKNOWN
ARE
THE
SEVENTHDAY
ADVENTISTS
AND
JEHOVAHS
WITNESSES
THEY
ARGUE
THAT
ACT
IS
NOT
A
REGULAR
WORSHIP
SERVICE
BUT
A
SPECIAL
MEETING
TO
SEE
PAUL
OFF
AND
THAT
I
COR
DOESNT
EXPLICITLY
SAY
ITS
A
REGULAR
WORSHIP
SERVICE
DO
YOU
PREFER
IMPLICATION
TO
FACT
A
CAREFUL
STUDY
OF
THE
ACTS
SHOWS
THAT
THE
MEETING
WAS
ON
SATURDAY
NIGHT
AND
THAT
ON
SUNDAY
MORNING
PAUL
DID
NOT
GO
TO
A
WORSHIP
SERVICE
BUT
SET
OFF
ON
A
LONG
JOURNEY
BY
FOOT
TO
ASSOS
IN
ICOR
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
YOU
CAN
EQUATE
LAY
BY
HIM
IN
STORE
WITH
GO
TO
A
WORSHIP
SERVICE
ITS
CLEAR
THAT
THIS
ISSUE
WAS
A
CONTESTED
ONE
IN
PAULS
TIME
SEE
ROM
PAULS
ADVICE
IS
THAT
WE
SHOULD
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
ABOUT
JUDGING
EACH
OTHER
ON
ISSUES
LIKE
THIS
ONE
PERSON
SEES
A
SPECIFIC
DAY
AS
MANDATED
BY
GOD
WHILE
ANOTHER
DOES
NOT
HE
WHO
OBSERVES
THAT
SPECIFIC
DAY
DOES
IT
IN
HONOR
OF
THE
LORD
HE
WHO
BELIEVES
HIS
WORSHIP
IS
FREE
OF
SUCH
RESTRICTIONS
ALSO
DOES
IT
IN
HONOR
OF
THE
LORD
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
SABBATH
IS
STILL
MANDATED
ARGUE
THAT
PAUL
IS
NOT
REFERRING
TO
SABBATH
WORSHIP
HERE
NOTE
HOWEVER
COL
WHICH
SAYS
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
BUT
BRIEFER
IT
EXPLICITLY
MENTIONS
SABBATH
WRONG
THESE
ARE
THE
SABBATH
DAYS
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
NOT
THE
SABBATH
DAY
OF
THE
MORAL
LAW
THERE
ARE
SOME
DIFFERENCES
AMONG
CHRISTIANS
ABOUT
USE
OF
THE
WORD
SABBATH
ORIGINALLY
THE
TERM
REFERRED
TO
THE
DAY
THE
JEWISH
DAY
OF
WORSHIP
MANY
CHRISTIANS
NOW
USE
IT
TO
REFER
TO
SUNDAY
THE
DAY
OF
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
THEY
DO
THIS
LARGELY
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
APPLY
THE
OR
WHATEVER
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
DIFFERENT
NUMBERING
SCHEMES
COMMANDMENT
TO
IT
REFORMED
TRADITION
DOES
NOT
DO
THIS
IT
DISTINGUISHES
BETWEEN
THE
SABBATH
WHICH
IS
THE
OBSERVANCE
MANDATED
FOR
JEWS
AND
THE
LORDS
DAY
WHICH
IS
THE
FREE
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
THE
ONLY
REFERENCE
I
CAN
FIND
TO
THIS
IN
THE
NT
IS
REV
THERE
ARE
ALSO
DIFFERENCES
ABOUT
LAWS
REGARDING
THIS
DAY
MANY
CHRISTIANS
SUPPORT
BLUE
LAWS
BOTH
IN
SECULAR
LAW
AND
CHURCH
LAW
SETTING
ASIDE
THAT
DAY
AND
CAUSING
PEOPLE
TO
SPEND
IT
IN
WORSHIP
THE
MORE
RADICAL
ANTILEGAL
APPROACH
SEES
SUCH
REGULATIONS
AS
A
RETURN
TO
THE
JEWISH
SABBATH
WHICH
IS
NOT
APPROPRIATE
TO
THE
FREE
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
OF
THE
LORDS
DAY
WHY
WOULD
YOU
PREFER
TO
TWIST
AND
TURN
RELYING
ON
DIFFERENT
ARGUMENTS
WHICH
CONFLICT
WITH
EACH
OTHER
RATHER
THAN
OBEY
A
SIMPLE
REQUEST
FROM
A
GOD
WHO
LOVED
YOU
ENOUGH
TO
DIE
FOR
YOU
JESUS
DIED
BECAUSE
THE
LAW
COULD
NOT
BE
CHANGED
WHY
BOTHER
TO
DIE
IN
ORDER
TO
MEET
THE
DEMANDS
OF
A
BROKEN
LAW
IF
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
IS
CHANGE
THE
LAW
PENALTIES
FOR
LAW
BREAKING
MEANS
THE
LAW
IS
IMMUTABLE
THAT
IS
WHY
IT
IS
NO
SIN
NOT
TO
FOLLOW
THE
DEMANDS
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAWS
IT
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
A
SIN
TO
MAKE
FALSE
GODS
TO
VIOLATE
GODS
NAME
TO
BREAK
THE
SABBATH
TO
STEAL
TO
KILL
ETC
EXCEPT
IT
YOU
DISAGREE
BUT
THEN
YOUR
OPINION
HAS
NO
WEIGHT
WHEN
PLACED
NEXT
TO
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
DARIUS
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
HOW
MUCH
MORE
NEEDS
TO
BE
SAID
OTHER
THAN
THE
FAQ
I
THINK
PAULS
COMMENTS
ON
ESTEEMING
ONE
DAY
OVER
ANOTHER
ROM
IS
PROBABLY
ALL
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
SAID
I
ACCEPT
THAT
DARIUS
IS
DOING
WHAT
HE
DOES
IN
HONOR
OF
THE
LORD
I
JUST
WISH
HE
MIGHT
EQUALLY
ACCEPT
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ESTEEM
ALL
DAYS
ALIKE
ARE
SIMILARLY
DOING
THEIR
BEST
TO
HONOR
THE
LORD
HOWEVER
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
CLEAR
THAT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THERES
UNAMBIGUOUS
PROOF
THAT
REGULAR
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
WAS
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
AS
I
INDICATED
THERE
ARE
RESPONSES
ON
BOTH
OF
THE
PASSAGES
CITED
THE
DIFFICULTY
WITH
BOTH
OF
THESE
PASSAGES
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
ACTUALLY
ABOUT
SOMETHING
ELSE
THEY
BOTH
LOOK
LIKE
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
NNREGULAR
CHRISTIAN
MEETINGS
BUT
NEITHER
EXPLICITLY
SAYS
AND
THEY
GATHERED
EVERY
SUNDAY
FOR
WORSHIP
WE
GET
VARIOUS
PIECES
OF
INFORMATION
BUT
NOTHING
AIMED
AT
ANSWERING
THIS
QUESTION
ACT
DESCRIBES
CHRISTIANS
AS
PARTICIPATING
BOTH
IN
JEWISH
TEMPLE
WORSHIP
AND
IN
CHRISTIAN
COMMUNION
SERVICES
IN
HOMES
OBVIOUSLY
THE
TEMPLE
WORSHIP
IS
ON
THE
SABBATH
ACTS
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
CHRISTIANS
PARTICIPATING
IN
THEM
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
DOESNT
TELL
US
WHAT
DAY
CHRISTIANS
MET
IN
THEIR
HOUSES
ACTS
DESPITE
DARIUS
CONFUSION
IS
DESCRIBED
BY
ACTS
AS
OCCURING
ON
SUNDAY
I
SEE
NO
REASON
TO
IMPOSE
MODERN
DEFINITIONS
OF
WHEN
DAYS
START
WHEN
THE
BIBLICAL
TEXT
IS
CLEAR
ABOUT
WHAT
WAS
MEANT
THE
WORDING
IMPLIES
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
NORMAL
MEETING
IT
DOESNT
SAY
THEY
GATHERED
TO
SEE
PAUL
OFF
BUT
THAT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
GATHERED
FOR
BREAKING
BREAD
PAUL
TALKED
ABOUT
HIS
UPCOMING
TRAVEL
BUT
THATS
JUST
NOT
EXPLICIT
ENOUGH
TO
BE
REALLY
CONVINCING
SIMILARLY
WITH
COR
IT
SAYS
THAT
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
THEY
SHOULD
SET
ASIDE
MONEY
FOR
PAULS
COLLECTION
NOW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
GATHERED
SPECIALLY
TO
DO
THIS
OR
THAT
THEY
DID
IT
IN
THEIR
HOMES
I
CANT
DISPROVE
IT
BUT
THE
OBVIOUS
TIME
FOR
A
CONGREGATION
TO
TAKE
AN
OFFERING
WOULD
BE
WHEN
THEY
NORMALLY
GATHER
FOR
WORSHIP
AND
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTED
TO
DO
IT
IN
THEIR
HOMES
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
REASON
TO
MENTION
A
SPECIFIC
DAY
SO
I
THINK
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
READING
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
EVERY
WEEK
SIMPLY
MEANS
EVERY
TIME
THEY
GATHER
FOR
WORSHIP
I
THINK
THE
REASON
WE
HAVE
ONLY
IMPLICATIONS
AND
NOT
CLEAR
STATEMENTS
IS
THAT
THE
NT
AUTHORS
ASSUMED
THAT
THEIR
READERS
KNEW
WHEN
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
WAS
CLH
