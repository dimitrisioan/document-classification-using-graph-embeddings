RE
TUFF
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
PLEASE
REALIZE
THAT
I
AM
FREQUENTLY
GETTING
IN
TROUBLE
FOR
STRAYING
FROM
ORTHODOXY
BUT
HERE
IS
MY
OPINION
IN
ARTICLE
MDBSMSUKYEDU
NO
NAME
WRITES
MOREOVER
THE
BUDDHA
SAYS
THAT
WE
ARE
INTRINSICALLY
GOOD
AS
AGAINST
CHRISTS
WE
ARE
ALL
SINNERS
I
NEVER
THOUGHT
OF
THESE
TWO
IDEAS
BEING
AGAINST
EACH
OTHER
PEOPLE
MIGHT
QUIBBLE
ABOUT
WHAT
INTRINSICALLY
MEANS
BUT
THE
REASON
WE
ARE
SINNERS
IS
BECAUSE
WE
DO
NOT
BEHAVE
AS
GOOD
AS
WE
ARE
THE
MESSAGE
OF
CHRIST
IS
THAT
EACH
OF
US
ARE
NOT
ONLY
GOOD
BUT
GREAT
THAT
WE
CAN
APPROACH
PERFECTION
ALBEIT
PERHAPS
THROUGH
A
DIFFERENT
TECHNIQUE
THAN
YOU
CLAIM
BUDDHISM
TEACHES
BECAUSE
WE
DO
NOT
REALIZE
OUR
GREATNESS
WE
SIN
PETER
HAD
NO
PROBLEM
WALKING
ON
WATER
UNTIL
A
LITTLE
DOUBT
CREPT
IN
DOESNT
DAVID
ASK
IN
THE
PSALM
WHAT
IS
MAN
THAT
YOU
GOD
SHOULD
CARE
FOR
HIM
BUT
YOU
HAVE
MADE
HIM
JUST
A
LITTLE
LOWER
THAN
THE
ANGELS
I
PROBABLY
EXAGERATE
IN
MY
MIND
WHAT
A
SCRAWNY
LITTLE
KID
DAVID
WAS
JUST
AS
I
PROBABLY
EXAGERATE
WHAT
A
GIGANTIC
MONSTER
GOLIATH
WAS
BUT
DAVIDS
POWER
EASILY
DEFEATED
GOLIATHS
REMEMBER
THE
RICH
YOUNG
MAN
WHO
COMES
UP
TO
JESUS
AND
ASKS
WHAT
HE
CAN
DO
TO
ENTER
THE
KINGDOM
JESUS
SAYS
FOLLOW
THE
COMMANDMENTS
I
ALWAYS
PICTURE
THE
SMUG
LOOK
ON
HIS
FACE
AS
HE
SAYS
HES
DONE
THAT
HIS
WHOLE
LIFE
PROBABLY
ANTICIPATING
AN
ATTABOY
FROM
THE
MESSIAH
INSTEAD
JESUS
GIVES
HIM
A
HARDER
TASK
SELL
EVERYTHING
AND
FOLLOW
HIM
JESUS
IS
RAISING
THE
BAR
THE
DESCIPLES
SAY
HOW
CAN
ANYONE
DO
THIS
IF
ITS
SO
HARD
EVEN
FOR
RICH
PEOPLE
JESUS
SAYS
ANYONE
CAN
DO
IT
WITH
GODS
HELP
JESUS
SAYS
NOT
ONLY
CAN
WE
AVOID
KILLING
PEOPLE
WE
CAN
AVOID
GETTING
ANGRY
AT
PEOPLE
NOT
ONLY
CAN
WE
AVOID
COMMITTING
ADULTERY
WE
CAN
CONTROL
OUR
OWN
DESIRES
I
REALIZE
THIS
WAS
NOT
YOUR
MAIN
POINT
BUT
I
WONDER
HOW
OTHER
PEOPLE
SEE
THIS
PARTING
QUESTION
WOULD
YOU
HAVE
BECOME
A
CHRISTIAN
IF
YOU
HAD
NOT
BEEN
INDOCTRINATED
BY
YOUR
PARENTS
YOU
PROBABLY
NEVER
LEARNED
ABOUT
ANY
OTHER
RELIGION
TO
MAKE
A
COMPARATIVE
STUDY
AND
THEREFORE
I
CLAIM
YOU
ARE
BRAIN
WASHED
PLEASE
FORGIVE
ANY
GENERALIZATIONS
I
AM
ABOUT
TO
MAKE
YOUR
POINT
ABOUT
HOW
HARD
OTHER
RELIGIONS
ARE
IS
A
GOOD
ONE
JUST
AS
YOUR
PARTING
QUESTION
IS
A
TOUGH
QUESTION
I
THINK
THAT
MUSLIMS
WORSHIP
THE
SAME
GOD
AS
I
DO
WE
CAN
LEARN
FROM
THEIR
NAME
SUBMISSION
HINDUS
AND
BUDDHISTS
AND
TAOISTS
ETC
CLAIM
THAT
GOD
IS
IMPERSONAL
IS
GOD
PERSONAL
OR
IMPERSONAL
I
SAY
YES
BUT
IF
I
THINK
A
LITTLE
MORE
MY
ANSWER
IS
WHICHEVER
IS
GREATER
I
THINK
IT
IS
GREATER
TO
BE
A
PERSONAL
ENTITY
WITH
AN
INDIVIDUAL
CONSCIOUSNESS
BUT
YOURE
RIGHT
THAT
THAT
MIGHT
BE
A
CULTURAL
BIAS
IF
I
THINK
MORE
I
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
GODS
PERSONAL
NATURE
IS
AS
FAR
BEYOND
MY
CONCEPTION
AS
HIS
IMPERSONAL
NATURE
IS
BEYOND
THE
HINDUS
CONCEPTION
IF
SOMEHOW
JESUS
COULD
FIT
INTO
HINDU
COSMOLOGY
THEN
MAYBE
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
THOUGH
THAT
IS
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
ARE
THERE
ANY
FORMER
OR
PRESENT
EASTERN
RELIGION
MEMBERS
HERE
WHO
COULD
COMMENT
