CERTAINTY
AND
ARROGANCE
DEAN
VELASCO
QUOTED
A
LETTER
FROM
JAMES
M
STOWELL
PRESIDENT
OF
MOODY
BIBLE
INSTITUTE
THE
OTHER
DAY
I
WAS
AT
THE
DRY
CLEANER
AND
THE
RADIO
WAS
PLAYING
IT
CAUGHT
MY
ATTENTION
BECAUSE
A
TALK
SHOW
GUEST
WAS
CRITICIZING
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS
SAYING
WE
BELIEVE
IN
ABSOLUTES
AND
THINK
WE
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ABSOLUTES
ARE
WE
AFFIRM
THE
ABSOLUTES
OF
SCRIPTURE
NOT
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
ARROGANT
MORALISTS
BUT
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
WHO
IS
TRUTH
WHO
HAS
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTH
IN
HIS
WORD
AND
THEREFORE
WE
HOLD
AS
PRECIOUS
THE
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
OF
THOSE
ABSOLUTES
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
LOT
OF
DISCUSSION
BUT
SO
FAR
NOBODY
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
HIT
ON
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
CRITICISM
OF
ARROGANCE
IS
AIMED
AT
THE
ARROGANCE
BEING
ATTACKED
IS
THAT
WE
THINK
WE
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ABSOLUTES
ARE
IN
SHORT
MANY
EVANGELICALS
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
ARE
INFALLIBLE
ON
THE
MATTER
OF
RELIGIOUS
TEXTS
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
PROBLEM
IS
ONE
OF
EPISTEMOLOGY
AS
A
SHORTHAND
YOU
CAN
THINK
OF
EPISTEMOLOGY
AS
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
QUESTION
IT
TURNS
OUT
IS
A
VERY
TROUBLING
ONE
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
IS
THAT
AT
THE
BOTTOM
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THE
THINKING
GOES
ON
INSIDE
YOUR
OWN
HEAD
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
BE
CERTAIN
THAT
EVERYTHING
WHICH
HAPPENS
IN
YOUR
HEAD
IS
INFALLIBLE
THE
REASONING
YOU
DID
TO
DISCOVER
A
SOURCE
OF
TRUTH
IS
IN
QUESTION
AND
THAT
MEANS
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
ABSOLUTE
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
YOUR
SOURCE
OF
AUTHORITY
WHICH
MEANS
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
LETS
TAKE
THE
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLE
OF
BIBLICAL
INERRANCY
AND
A
FICTIONAL
INERRANTIST
NAMED
ZEKE
THE
FOLLOWING
ARGUMENTS
APPLIES
TO
THE
IDEA
OF
PAPAL
INFALLIBILITY
TOO
ZEKE
HAS
WE
PRESUME
SPENT
SOME
TIME
STUDYING
THE
BIBLE
AND
HISTORY
AND
SEVERAL
OTHER
TOPICS
HE
HAS
CONCLUDED
BASED
ON
ALL
THESE
STUDIES
AND
POSSIBLY
SOME
RELIGIOUS
EXPERIENCES
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
A
SOURCE
OF
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
HE
MAY
BE
CORRECT
BUT
EVEN
IF
HE
IS
HE
CANNOT
BE
CERTAIN
THAT
HE
IS
CORRECT
HIS
CONCLUSION
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
WELL
HE
STUDIED
HISTORY
HE
MAY
HAVE
MADE
MISTAKES
AND
THE
REFERENCES
HE
USED
MAY
HAVE
CONTAINED
MISTAKES
HIS
CONCLUSION
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
WELL
HE
STUDIED
THE
BIBLE
HE
MAY
HAVE
MADE
MISTAKES
HIS
CONCLUSION
DEPENDS
ON
HIS
OWN
REASONING
AND
HE
MAY
HAVE
MADE
MISTAKES
NOTICING
A
COMMON
THREAD
YET
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
HIS
STUDY
OF
THE
WORLD
THAT
HE
DID
EVERYTHING
THAT
HAPPENED
IN
HIS
OWN
HEAD
IS
LIMITED
BY
HIS
OWN
THINKING
NO
MATTER
WHAT
HE
DOES
TO
TRY
AND
COVER
HIS
MISTAKES
HE
CAN
NEVER
BE
CERTAIN
OF
HIS
OWN
INFALLIBILITY
AS
LONG
AS
ANY
PART
OF
THE
BELIEF
IS
BASED
ON
HIS
OWN
REASONING
THAT
BELIEF
CANNOT
BE
CONSIDERED
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
ZEKE
BELIEVES
THAT
HE
HAS
FOUND
A
SOURCE
OF
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
BUT
THAT
BELIEF
IS
ONLY
AS
GOOD
AS
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
SEARCH
HE
MADE
FOR
IT
UNLESS
HE
CAN
SAY
THAT
HIS
OWN
REASONING
IS
FLAWLESS
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
ARE
IN
DOUBT
ANY
BELIEF
THAT
YOU
HOLD
ABOUT
ABSOLUTE
SOURCES
OF
TRUTH
DEPENDS
IN
PART
ON
YOUR
OWN
THINKING
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
ONLY
AN
INFALLIBLE
THINKER
CAN
HAVE
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
IN
ALL
HIS
BELIEFS
THIS
IS
EASY
TO
DEMONSTRATE
LETS
GO
BACK
TO
OUR
SHORTHAND
METHOD
OF
DOING
EPISTEMOLOGY
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
IMAGINE
A
HYPOTHETICAL
DISCUSSION
A
THE
BIBLE
IS
A
SOURCE
OF
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
B
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
A
I
STUDIED
HISTORY
AND
THE
BIBLE
AND
RELIGIOUS
WRITINGS
AND
CHURCH
TEACHINGS
AND
CAME
TO
THIS
CONCLUSION
B
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
YOU
STUDIED
HISTORY
CORRECTLY
A
WELL
I
DOUBLECHECKED
EVERYTHING
B
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
YOU
DOUBLECHECKED
CORRECTLY
A
WELL
I
COMPARED
MY
ANSWERS
WITH
SOME
SMART
PEOPLE
AND
WE
AGREED
B
JUST
BECAUSE
SOME
SMART
GUY
BELIEVES
SOMETHING
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
IT
IS
TRUE
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THEY
STUDIED
IT
CORRECTLY
A
AND
AS
YOU
SEE
B
WILL
EVENTUALLY
GET
A
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
HE
HAS
TO
SAY
I
CANT
PROVE
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
MISTAKES
AND
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
MAY
HAVE
MADE
A
MISTAKE
THEN
YOU
CANNOT
BE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
ARISES
MANY
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
THEIR
OWN
PERSONAL
RESEARCH
CAN
GIVE
THEM
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
ABOUT
THE
DOCTRINES
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THEY
ARE
IMPLICITLY
CLAIMING
THAT
THEY
ARE
INFALLIBLE
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
POSSIBILITY
OF
MISTAKE
CLAIMING
THAT
YOU
CANNOT
HAVE
MADE
A
MISTAKE
AND
THAT
YOUR
THINKING
HAS
LED
YOU
TO
A
FLAWLESS
CONCLUSION
IS
PRETTY
ARROGANT
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
TO
SEE
THIS
ARGUMENT
EXPLAINED
IN
GREAT
DETAIL
SHOULD
TRY
TO
FIND
THE
INFALLIBILITY
OF
THE
CHURCH
BY
GEORGE
SALMON
HE
IS
ATTACKING
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
POPE
CAN
BE
KNOWABLY
INFALLIBLE
AND
HE
DOES
SO
VERY
WELL
BUT
THE
GENERAL
ARGUMENT
APPLIES
EQUALLY
WELL
TO
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
KNOWABLY
INERRANT
