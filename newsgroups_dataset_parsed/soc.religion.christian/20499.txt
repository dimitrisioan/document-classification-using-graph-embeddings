RE
PROPHETIC
WARNING
TO
NEW
YORK
CITY
IN
ARTICLE

EVENSON
THOMAS
RANDALL
WRITES
WHICH
BRINGS
ME
AROUND
TO
ASKING
AN
OPEN
QUESTION
IS
THE
BIBLE
A
CLOSED
BOOK
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
IT
OKAY
FOR
US
TO
GO
AROUND
SAYING
GOD
TOLD
ME
THIS
AND
JESUS
TOLD
ME
THAT
WOULDNT
THAT
IMPLY
THAT
GOD
IS
STILL
POURING
OUT
NEW
REVELATION
TO
US
I
KNOW
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
FEEL
THAT
IS
OKAY
AND
SOME
WILL
NOT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
CLOSED
CANON
WOULD
CERTAINLY
CAST
A
SHADOW
ON
CONTEMPORARY
PROPHETS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
AN
OPEN
CANON
SEEMS
TO
BE
INDICATED
SOMETIMES
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
RUNNING
AROUND
SAYING
GOD
TOLD
ME
THIS
AND
GOD
TOLD
ME
THAT
THESE
DAYS
SOME
PEOPLE
REALLY
HAVE
HEARD
GOD
AND
OTHERS
HEARD
THEIR
GLANDS
MARIO
MURRILLO
MENTIONED
THIS
IN
A
SERMON
ONCE
HE
SAID
SOMEONE
TOLD
HIM
THE
LORD
GAVE
ME
A
SONG
HE
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
WORST
SONG
HE
HAD
EVER
HEARD
I
KNOW
WHY
HE
GAVE
YOU
THAT
SONG
MURILLO
SAID
HE
DIDNT
WANT
IT
ANYMORE
BUT
GOD
DOES
STILL
SPEAK
TO
HIS
PEOPLE
TODAY
AND
THE
IDEA
IS
CONTRARY
TO
THE
IDEA
OF
A
CLOSED
CANNON
IRENEAUS
WROTE
ABOUT
ALL
THE
GIFTS
OF
THE
SPIRIT
IN
THE
CHURCH
OF
HIS
DAY
AND
CENTURY
AND
HE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
FIRST
TO
PUT
FORTH
A
NEW
TESTAMENT
CANNON
WHICH
WAS
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
TO
THE
ONE
WE
HAVE
TODAY
HE
BELIEVED
IN
A
CLOSED
CANNON
MANY
PROPHETS
PROPHESIED
PROPHECIES
WHICH
WERE
NOT
RECORDED
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
FOR
EXAMPLE
ONE
PROPHET
IN
KINGS
WHOSE
NAME
STARTS
WITH
AN
M
WHO
PROPHECIED
THAT
THE
KING
WOULD
LOSE
A
BATTLE
THAT
IS
THE
ONLY
PROPHECY
HE
GAVE
RECORDED
IN
SCRIPTURE
AND
WE
NO
THAT
HE
HAD
GIVEN
OTHER
PROPHECIES
BECAUSE
THE
KING
COMPLAINED
BEFORE
HE
HEARD
THE
PROPHECY
HE
NEVER
PROPHESIES
ANYTHING
GOOD
ABOUT
ME
YET
ONLY
ONE
LITTLE
PARAGRAPH
OF
ALL
OF
HIS
LIFETIME
OF
PROPHECIES
ARE
RECORDED
IN
SCRIPTURE
THERE
ARE
NUMEROUS
EXAMPLES
BARNABAS
WAS
A
PROPHET
ACTS
SAYS
BEFORE
HE
WAS
EVEN
SENT
OUT
AS
AN
APOSTLE
YET
HIS
WRITINGS
ARE
NOT
RECORDED
IN
SCRIPTURE
ONLY
TWO
OF
AGABUS
PROPHECIES
ARE
MENTIONED
IN
SCRIPTURE
HE
WAS
ALREADY
A
PROPHET
BEFORE
HE
GAVE
THEM
SO
PROPHECY
MAY
BE
GENUINE
AND
FROM
GOD
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
IT
SCRIPTURE
ALSO
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
IS
THAT
SOME
SO
CALLED
PROPHECIES
ARE
NOTHING
NEW
BUT
RATHER
AN
INSPIRED
TRANSLATION
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
IT
RIGHT
TO
CALL
THAT
PROPHECY
MISLEADING
WOULDNT
THAT
BE
MORE
HAVING
TO
DO
WITH
KNOWLEDGE
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
TRANSLATIONS
OF
SCRIPTURE
BUT
I
AM
FAMILIAR
WITH
PROPHECIES
THAT
GIVE
APPLICATIONS
FOR
SCRIPTURE
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SIMILAR
EXAMPLES
IN
THE
BIBLE
SEVERAL
TIMES
PETER
INTERPRETS
PROPHECIES
IN
A
SEEMINGLY
PROPHETIC
WAY
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
HIS
BISHOPRICK
LET
ANOTHER
TAKE
CONCERNING
JUDAS
OFFICE
A
CLEARER
EXAMPLE
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
MATTHEW
JESUS
IS
PROPHESYING
ABOUT
WHAT
WILL
HAPPEN
BEFORE
HIS
RETURN
AND
HE
QUOTES
A
PASSAGE
OUT
OF
JOEL
ABOUT
THE
SUN
BEING
DARKENED
AND
THE
MOON
TURNING
TO
BLOOD
SO
SCRIPTURAL
PROPHECY
CAN
BE
USED
IN
LATER
PROPHECY
SOMETIMES
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
CAN
CROSS
OVER
INTO
BEING
A
WORD
OF
KNOWLEDGE
BUT
GIFTS
OF
THE
SPIRIT
SEEM
TO
OVERLAP
WORDS
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
WISDOM
CAN
OVERLAP
THE
WORD
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
PROPHECY
CAN
OVERLAP
INTERPRETATION
OF
TOUNGES
IS
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
PROPHECY
HEALINGS
ARE
OFTEN
CONSIDERED
MIRACLES
SO
SOMETIMES
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
GIFTS
IS
A
BIT
HAZY
IMHO
IT
DOESNT
USUALLY
MATTER
THAT
MUCH
IF
WE
ARE
ABLE
TO
LABEL
A
PHENOMENON
AS
LONG
AS
WE
RECOGNIZE
THEM
AS
THE
WORK
OF
THE
SPIRIT
AND
USE
THEM
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
LEADING
LINK
