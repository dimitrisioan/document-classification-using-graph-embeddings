PS
IF
YOU
DO
SINCERELY
BELIEVE
THAT
A
GOD
EXISTS
WHY
DO
YOU
FOLLOW
IT
BLINDLY
DO
THE
WORDS
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
MEAN
ANYTHING
TO
YOU
I
DEFY
ANY
THEIST
TO
REPLY
DELETIA
FORMALITIES
I
PROBABLY
SHOULD
LET
THIS
PASS
ITS
NOT
WORTH
THE
TIME
AND
ITS
NOT
REALLY
INTENDED
FOR
ME
BUT
I
COULDNT
RESIST
A
PERSONAL
WEAKNESS
OF
MINE
JERKIUS
KNEEUS
TRAGICALLY
INCURABLE
THE
FOUNDATION
FOR
FAITH
IN
GOD
IS
REASON
WITHOUT
WHICH
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
COULD
NOT
BE
PROVEN
THAT
HIS
EXISTENCE
CAN
BE
PROVEN
BY
REASON
IS
INDISPUTABLE
CF
MY
SHORT
TREATISE
TRADITIONAL
PROOFS
FOR
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
AND
SUMMA
THEOLOGICA
NOT
SO
I
CAN
PROVE
THAT
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
GOD
IS
DISPUTABLE
BY
SHOWING
THAT
PEOPLE
DISPUTE
IT
THIS
IS
EASY
I
DISPUTE
THAT
GOD
EXISTS
SIMPLE
I
MISSED
YOUR
TRADITIONAL
PROOFS
TREATISE
BUT
THE
PROOFS
I
REMEMBER
FROM
THE
SUMMA
THEOLOGIC
THE
WAYS
I
THINK
IT
WAS
WERE
RATHER
POOR
STUFF
THE
ONTOLOGICAL
ARGUMENT
IS
ABOUT
A
BILLION
TIMES
BETTER
IMHO
I
WOULD
THINK
YOUD
WANT
NONTRADITIONAL
PROOFS
CONSIDERING
THE
GENERAL
FAILURE
OF
THE
TRADITIONAL
PROOFS
AT
LEAST
THE
ONES
I
KNOW
OF
I
AM
THINKING
OF
THE
ONTOLOGICAL
ARGUMENT
THE
COSMOLOGICAL
ARGUMENT
AND
THE
TELEOLOGICAL
ARGUMENT
THOSE
ARE
THE
ONES
TRADITIONAL
ENOUGH
TO
HAVE
FUNNY
NAMES
ANYWAY
NOW
GIVEN
THAT
GOD
EXISTS
AND
THAT
HIS
EXISTENCE
CAN
BE
PROVEN
BY
REASON
I
ASSERT
THAT
HIS
COMMANDS
MUST
BE
FOLLOWED
BLINDLY
ALTHOUGH
IN
OUR
FALLEN
CONDITION
WE
MUST
ALWAYS
HAVE
SOME
MEASURE
OF
DOUBT
ABOUT
OUR
FAITH
WHY
THIS
IS
THE
REAL
QUESTION
SO
TO
DISCUSS
IT
ILL
ASSUME
GOD
EXISTS
OTHERWISE
THERE
IS
NO
HEAVENLY
AUTHORITY
TO
BABBLE
ABOUT
BECAUSE
GOD
IS
THE
FIRST
CAUSE
OF
ALL
THINGS
THE
FIRST
MOVER
OF
MATTER
THE
INDEPENDENT
THING
THAT
REQUIRES
NOTHING
ELSE
FOR
ITS
EXISTENCE
THE
MEASURE
OF
ALL
THAT
IS
PERFECT
AND
THE
ESSENTIAL
BEING
WHO
GIVES
ORDER
TO
THE
UNIVERSE
LOGOS
PLEASE
SHOW
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
I
AM
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
FIRST
CAUSE
ARGUMENT
AND
ILL
ACCEPT
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
THAT
THERE
IS
A
FIRST
CAUSE
EVEN
THOUGH
I
FIND
SOME
OF
ITS
PREMICES
QUESTIONABLE
THE
REST
YOULL
HAVE
TO
SHOW
THIS
INCLUDES
THAT
THE
FIRST
CAUSE
IS
GOD
I
NEXT
ASSERT
THAT
GOD
IS
ALL
GOOD
GOT
IT
I
DENY
THAT
GOD
IS
ALL
GOOD
SO
THERE
IF
THIS
IS
SO
THEN
THAT
WHICH
IS
CONTRARY
TO
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
IS
EVIL
IE
THE
ABSENCE
OF
THE
GOOD
AND
SINCE
GOD
CAN
NEVER
CONTRADICT
HIMSELF
THEN
BY
HIS
PROMISE
OF
A
SAVIOR
AS
EARLY
AS
THE
PROTOEVANGELIUM
OF
GENESIS
GOD
INSTRUCTS
THAT
BECAUSE
A
HUMAN
ADAM
WAS
FIRST
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
MANS
ALIENATION
FROM
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
GOOD
A
MAN
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
TO
ACT
TO
RESTORE
THE
FRIENDSHIP
THUS
GOD
BECAME
INCARNATE
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
THE
MESSIAH
THIS
ISNT
SELFCONSISTENT
IF
HUMANS
MUST
RENEW
THE
RELATIONSHIP
THEN
GOD
INCARNATE
OR
NOT
CANT
DO
IT
WELL
UNLESS
YOU
THINK
GOD
IS
HUMAN
GRANTED
GOD
MADE
HIMSELF
HUMAN
BUT
THIS
IS
NONETHELESS
CHEATING
THE
INTENT
OF
THE
STATEMENT
IS
CLEARLY
THAT
MAN
HAS
TO
FIX
THE
PROBLEM
HE
CAUSED
GOD
FIXING
IT
EVEN
BY
INDIRECT
MEANS
CONTRADICTS
THIS
NOW
THIS
MESSIAH
CLAIMED
THAT
HE
IS
THE
TRUTH
JOHN
IF
THIS
CLAIM
IS
TRUE
THEN
WE
ARE
BOUND
BY
REASON
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
WHO
IS
TRUTH
INCARNATE
WHY
ALSO
WHY
ASSUME
SAID
CLAIM
IS
TRUE
ANYWAY
IF
I
CLAIM
TO
BE
TRUTH
ARE
YOU
BOUND
BY
REASON
TO
FOLLOW
ME
YOU
NEXT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
AUTHORITY
HAVE
YOU
TRIED
THE
UNITED
STATES
MARINE
CORPS
YET
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
FIRSTHAND
THAT
IT
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
INSTRUCTOR
IN
AUTHORITY
UNDOUBTABLY
DO
YOU
MEAN
TO
IMPLY
WE
SHOULD
ALL
OBEY
THE
COMMANDS
OF
THE
MARINES
WITHOUT
QUESTION
YOU
SEEM
TO
IMPLY
THIS
ABOUT
GOD
AND
THAT
THE
MARINES
ARE
SIMILAR
IN
THIS
RESPECT
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
WHAT
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
SAY
THEY
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
WHAT
IT
IS
YOU
ARE
SAYING
AS
I
HAVE
MISSED
IT
IF
YOU
HAVE
NOT
YET
HAD
THE
PRIVILEGE
I
WILL
REPLY
THAT
THE
AUTHORITY
WHICH
IS
TRUTH
INCARNATE
MAY
NEVER
BE
QUESTIONED
AND
THUS
MUST
BE
FOLLOWED
BLINDLY
WHY
WHY
NOT
QUESTION
IT
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
TRUTH
WE
CANNOT
KNOW
THIS
CERTAINLY
SO
WHY
IS
IT
SO
IRRATIONAL
TO
QUESTION
PERHAPS
WE
WILL
THUS
DISCOVER
THAT
WE
WERE
WRONG
YOU
ASSERT
THAT
GOD
IS
TRUTH
AND
WE
CANT
QUESTION
TRUTH
BUT
I
ASSERT
THAT
GOD
IS
NOT
TRUTH
AND
ANYWAY
WE
CAN
QUESTION
TRUTH
HOW
IS
IT
MY
ASSERTION
IS
LESS
GOOD
THAN
YOURS
ONE
MAY
NOT
DENY
THE
TRUTH
OH
I
HEREBY
DENY
I
HOPE
YOULL
AGREE
IS
THE
TRUTH
GRANTED
I
LOOK
PRETTY
DAMN
SILLY
SAYING
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
BUT
I
NEEDED
SOMETHING
WED
BOTH
AGREE
WAS
CLEARLY
TRUE
NOW
YOULL
NOTICE
NO
STORMTROOPERS
HAVE
MARCHED
IN
TO
DRAG
ME
OFF
TO
THE
GULAG
NO
HEAVEN
LIGHTING
BOLTS
EITHER
NO
MYSTERIOUS
NET
OUTAGES
I
SEEM
TO
BE
PERMITED
TO
SAY
SUCH
THINGS
ABSURD
OR
NOT
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHEN
THE
PROVERBIAL
APPLE
FELL
ON
ISAAC
NEWTONS
HEAD
HE
COULD
HAVE
DENIED
THAT
IT
HAPPENED
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
THE
LAWS
OF
PHYSICS
MUST
BE
OBEYED
WHETHER
A
HUMAN
LIKES
THEM
OR
NOT
THEY
ARE
TRUE
THEY
ARE
CERTAINLY
NOT
TRUE
AT
LEAST
THE
ONES
NEWTON
DERIVED
ARE
NOT
TRUE
AND
ARE
INDEED
WILDLY
INACCURATE
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
OR
SMALL
DISTANCES
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
SET
OF
LAWS
OF
PHYSICS
THAT
ALWAYS
WORKS
IN
ALL
CASES
IF
WE
DID
PHYSICS
WOULD
BE
OVER
ALREADY
SCIENCE
IS
ALL
ABOUT
QUESTIONING
THIS
SORT
OF
TRUTH
IF
WE
DIDNT
WED
STILL
FOLLOW
ARISTOTLE
ID
GENERALIZE
THIS
A
LITTLE
MORE
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
LEARN
ANYTHING
NEW
YOU
MUST
QUESTION
THE
THINGS
YOU
KNOW
TM
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
BE
WRONG
THEREFORE
THE
AUTHORITY
WHICH
IS
TRUTH
MAY
NOT
BE
DENIED
EVEN
PRESUPPOSING
THAT
TRUTH
MAY
NOT
BE
DENIED
AND
MAY
NOT
BE
QUESTIONED
AND
THAT
GOD
IS
TRUTH
IT
ONLY
FOLLOWS
THAT
GOD
MAY
NOT
BE
DENIED
OR
QUESTIONED
NOT
THAT
HE
MUST
BE
OBEYED
WE
COULD
UNQUESTIONINGLY
DISOBEY
HIM
HOW
ANNOYING
OF
US
BUT
YOU
HAVE
NOT
CONNECTED
DENIAL
WITH
DISOBEDIENCE
DAN
NO
NICKNAME
JOHNSON
AND
GOD
SAID
JEEZE
THIS
IS
DULL
AND
IT
WAS
DULL
GENESIS
THESE
OPINIONS
PROBABLY
SHOW
WHAT
I
KNOW
