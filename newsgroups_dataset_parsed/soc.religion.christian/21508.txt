re
deuterocanicals
eps
sirach
thanks
for
the
responses
so
far
i
hope
that
i
have
sparked
some
thought
which
is
more
my
intent
than
to
restart
one
of
the
reformations
im
just
going
to
tug
on
two
threads
in
messageid
d
andrew
byler
writes
and
i
must
point
out
that
the
jews
only
drew
up
their
canon
in
ad
years
after
the
founding
of
the
christian
religion
upon
the
cross
why
should
we
adhere
to
a
canon
that
was
drawn
up
by
the
faithless
in
reaction
to
the
chrsitian
use
of
the
greek
septuagint
which
includes
the
deuterocanon
i
was
simply
observing
that
as
a
nonjew
i
am
not
in
that
community
which
might
be
bound
by
such
a
decision
i
dont
know
much
about
the
council
of
jamnia
but
i
have
heard
that
it
is
not
wellattested
historically
faithless
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
i
prefer
not
to
speculate
about
motives
as
early
as
ad
st
justin
had
already
accused
the
jews
of
mutilating
the
canon
of
scripture
by
their
removal
of
certain
books
i
wish
the
dialoguewithtrypho
were
a
real
transcript
of
a
real
dialogue
but
i
think
it
a
fictional
effect
on
justins
part
putting
that
to
one
side
justins
point
may
be
evidential
one
would
want
to
know
which
books
protestants
apparently
prefer
to
think
that
gods
revelation
was
limited
by
a
decree
of
the
jews
perhaps
the
reformers
were
traveling
in
all
the
light
ms
evidence
they
had
lets
stick
to
the
issues
again
i
prefer
not
to
speculate
about
motives
one
would
need
quotes
from
luther
calvin
etc
to
evidence
this
preference
in
messageid
wagnergracemathuhedu
david
wagner
that
is
not
quite
accurate
otherwise
we
would
have
the
book
of
enoch
in
the
canon
as
dave
noted
one
can
say
that
the
apocrypha
are
not
quoted
by
christ
is
this
the
principle
any
bc
text
not
quoted
by
christ
cannot
be
counted
as
scripture
think
well
about
this
job
ruth
i
wrote
these
is
a
logically
invalid
a
priori
besides
we
are
talking
about
ot
texts
which
in
many
parts
are
superceded
by
the
nt
in
the
xtian
view
would
not
this
same
principle
exclude
ecclesiastes
this
principle
cannot
be
consistently
applied
dave
w
answers
i
have
to
reject
your
argument
here
the
spirit
speaks
with
one
voice
and
he
does
not
contradict
himself
meaning
what
do
you
affirm
the
principle
that
the
dcs
can
be
excluded
since
they
contain
false
doctrine
or
do
you
deny
it
if
affirmed
as
is
implied
in
your
statement
how
does
one
determine
that
doctrine
x
is
false
do
you
affirm
every
teaching
in
ecclesiastes
the
ultimate
test
of
canonicity
is
whether
the
words
are
inspired
by
the
spirit
ie
godbreathed
it
is
a
test
which
is
more
guided
by
faith
than
by
reason
or
logic
if
so
it
may
be
a
test
that
cannot
be
applied
the
orthodox
faithfully
believe
that
psalm
is
canonical
how
can
my
faith
say
not
all
i
hear
here
is
the
a
priori
i
mentioned
before
the
deuterocanonical
books
were
added
much
later
in
the
churchs
history
this
is
contrary
to
fact
they
do
not
have
the
same
spiritual
quality
as
the
rest
of
scripture
can
this
be
elevated
to
a
principle
how
is
spiritual
quality
measured
ill
take
the
spiritual
quality
of
most
of
sirach
over
joshua
or
chronicles
any
day
i
do
not
believe
the
church
that
added
these
books
was
guided
by
the
spirit
in
so
doing
what
can
i
say
you
believe
what
you
believe
im
asking
for
a
consistency
check
i
dont
see
that
the
books
were
added
in
any
construction
this
formulation
begs
the
question
no
one
can
validly
ask
me
to
have
faith
that
these
books
are
noncanonical
dave
davis
these
are
my
opinions
activities
alone
qotd
christianity
is
not
a
doctrine
not
i
mean
a
theory
about
what
has
happened
and
will
happen
to
the
human
soul
but
a
description
of
something
that
actually
takes
place
in
a
human
life
for
consciousness
of
sin
is
a
real
event
and
so
are
despair
and
salvation
through
faith
those
who
speak
of
such
things
bunyan
for
instance
are
simply
describing
what
has
happened
to
them
whatever
anyone
may
want
to
say
about
it
