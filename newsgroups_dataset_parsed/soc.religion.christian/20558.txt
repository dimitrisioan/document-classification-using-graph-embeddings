RE
PANTHEISM
ENVIRONMENTALISM
IN
ARTICLE
GARY
V
CAVANO
WRITES
IM
NEW
TO
THIS
GROUP
AND
MAYBE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
COVERED
ALREADY
BUT
DOES
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
SEE
THE
CURRENT
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
ENVIRONMENT
BEING
TURNED
UNINTENTIONALLY
OF
COURSE
INTO
PANTHEISM
YES
I
AM
ADAMANTLY
AN
ENVIRONMENTALIST
I
WILL
NOT
USE
STYROFOAM
TABLE
SERVICE
PLEASE
KEEP
THAT
IN
MIND
AS
YOU
READ
THIS
POST
I
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
ATTACK
ENVIRONMENTALISM
A
HALF
TRUTH
IS
AT
LEAST
AS
DANGEROUS
AS
A
COMPLETE
LIE
A
COMPLETE
LIE
WILL
RARELY
BE
READILY
ACCEPTED
WHILE
A
HALF
TRUTH
THE
LIE
SUBTLY
HIDDEN
IS
MORE
POWERFULLY
OFFERED
BY
ONE
WHO
MASQUERADES
AS
AN
ANGEL
OF
LIGHT
SATAN
HAS
FOR
SOME
PEOPLE
LOOSENED
THE
GRIP
ON
TREATING
THE
EARTH
AS
SOMETHING
OTHER
THAN
GODS
INTRICATE
HANDIWORK
SOMETHING
OTHER
THAN
THAT
ON
WHICH
THE
HEALTH
OF
FUTURE
GENERATIONS
IS
BASED
IT
IS
BEING
TREATED
WITH
RESPECT
YOU
THINK
HES
GOING
TO
HAPPILY
LEAVE
IT
AT
THAT
NO
WHEN
ONE
ERROR
IS
REJECTED
IT
IS
HIS
STYLE
TO
PUSH
PEOPLE
TO
THE
OPPOSITE
ERROR
THEREFORE
THE
EARTH
IS
NOT
GODS
INTRICATE
HANDIWORK
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
RUBBISH
BUT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
GOD
MOTHER
EARTH
IS
THE
ONE
YOU
ARE
TO
PRIMARILY
LOVE
AND
SERVE
I
SEE
TWO
FACETS
OF
A
RESPONSE
TO
IT
CARE
FOR
THE
ENVIRONMENT
TREAT
IT
WITH
PROPER
RESPECT
BOTH
BECAUSE
IT
IS
GODS
INTRICATE
HANDIWORK
AND
THE
HEALTH
OF
FUTURE
GENERATION
AND
BECAUSE
SHOWING
THE
FACET
OF
ONE
WHO
IS
DISREGARDFUL
OF
SUCH
THINGS
DOES
NOT
CONSTITUTE
WHAT
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
CALLED
BECOMING
ALL
THINGS
TO
ALL
MEN
SO
THAT
BY
ALL
POSSIBLE
MEANS
I
MIGHT
SAVE
SOME
DONT
SAY
FORGET
THE
ENVIRONMENT
IVE
GOT
IMPORTANT
THINGS
TO
SPEND
MY
TIME
ON
PUTTING
YOUR
FOOT
IN
YOUR
MOUTH
IN
THIS
MANNER
WILL
DESTROY
YOUR
CREDIBILITY
IN
EXPRESSING
THE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
MORE
IMPORTANT
SHOW
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
ULTIMATE
ENTITY
THAT
IT
IS
CREATURE
AND
NOT
CREATOR
SHOW
THAT
ITS
BEAUTY
AND
GLORY
POINTS
TO
A
GREATER
BEAUTY
AND
GLORY
SHOW
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
ULTIMATE
TAPESTRY
BUT
ONE
OF
MANY
CORDS
WOVEN
IN
THE
INFINITE
TAPESTRY
GOD
GIVE
ME
MOUNTAINS
BUT
THE
GREATEST
JONATHAN
HAYWARD
TO
CLIMB
AND
THE
OF
THESE
IS
LOVE
