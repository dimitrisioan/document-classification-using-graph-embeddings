WRITES

WRITES
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
WHETHER
THERE
IS
A
WHY
OR
NOT
WE
HAVE
TO
FIND
IT
THIS
IS
PASCALS
WAGER
IF
THERE
IS
NO
WHY
AND
WE
SPEND
OUR
LIVES
SEARCHING
THEN
WE
HAVE
MERELY
WASTED
OUR
LIVES
WHICH
WERE
MEANINGLESS
ANYWAY
IF
THERE
IS
A
WHY
AND
WE
I
FIND
THIS
VIEW
OF
CHRISTIANITY
TO
BE
QUITE
DISHEARTENING
AND
SAD
THE
IDEA
THAT
LIFE
ONLY
HAS
MEANING
OR
IMPORTANCE
IF
THERE
IS
A
CREATOR
DOES
NOT
SEEM
LIKE
MUCH
OF
A
BASIS
FOR
BELIEF
PLEASE
FORGIVE
ALL
THE
INCLUSIONS
I
SUPPOSE
THEY
ARE
NECCESSARY
TO
FOLLOW
THE
ARGUMENT
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
IF
LIFE
HAS
MEANING
OR
IMPORTANCE
THEN
WE
SHOULD
TRY
TO
FIND
THAT
MEANING
OR
IMPORTANCE
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
A
TAUTOLOGY
I
HOPE
IM
NOT
BEING
TOO
PATRONIZING
ONE
TERM
FOR
THAT
MEANING
IS
CREATOR
THOUGH
THAT
IS
NOT
OBVIOUS
FROM
MY
ABOVE
ARGUMENT
AND
THE
LOGIC
IS
ALSO
APPALLING
GOD
MUST
EXIST
BECAUSE
I
WANT
HIM
TO
ITS
MORE
LIKE
I
THINK
THEREFORE
I
AM
THEREFORE
GOD
IS
I
HAVE
HEARD
THIS
LINE
OF
REASONING
BEFORE
AND
WONDER
HOW
PREVALENT
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
IN
MODERN
SOCIETY
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
CONVINCED
LIFE
IS
HOPELESS
OR
SO
THE
POLLSTERS
AND
NEWSCASTS
STATE
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
WHERE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
BECOME
RELIGIOUS
IF
YOU
WANT
MEANING
WHY
NOT
JUST
JOIN
A
CULT
SUCH
AS
IN
WACO
THE
LEADERS
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THE
SECURITY
BLANKET
YOU
DESIRE
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
TERM
RELIGIOUS
IS
AMBIGUOUS
TO
ME
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
I
COULD
SAY
THAT
SEARCHING
FOR
MEANING
IN
LIFE
IS
BY
DEFINITION
BEING
RELIGIOUS
I
COULD
SAY
CULT
FOLLOWERS
BY
DEFINITION
HAVE
GIVEN
UP
ON
THE
SEARCH
IF
YOU
WANT
MEANING
WHY
NOT
SEARCH
FOR
THE
TRUTH
SO
FAR
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IS
CONGRUENT
WITH
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
TRUTH
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
BEFORE
ME
WHO
HAVE
COME
TO
CONCLUSIONS
THAT
ARE
WORDED
IN
WAYS
THAT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
ME
BY
NO
MEANS
DOES
THAT
IMPLY
THAT
I
UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING
