WR
ITES
WHILE
THIS
IS
ESSENTIALLY
A
DISCUSSION
OF
REINCARNATION
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
CHRISTIANITY
GERRY
PALO
HAS
MADE
SOME
COMPARISONS
TO
ASIAN
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
ON
THIS
TOPIC
WHICH
HAVE
SIMPLIFIED
THE
ASIAN
IDEA
OF
KARMA
TO
THE
POINT
OF
MISREPRESENTATION
I
REALIZED
THAT
MY
GENERALIZATIONS
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
PROBLEMS
UNDER
SCRUTINY
FROM
VARIOUS
ASIAN
POINTS
OF
VIEW
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
DISCUSSED
IN
DETAIL
INDEED
BUT
FOR
THE
PURPOSES
OF
THIS
NEWSGROUP
AND
THREAD
THUS
FAR
AND
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
I
RISKED
OVERSIMPLI
FICATION
MY
MAIN
PURPOSE
WAS
TO
EMPHASIZE
THAT
I
WAS
NOT
COMING
FROM
A
BUDDHIST
OR
HINDU
POINT
OF
VIEW
AS
YOU
OBSERVED
THE
MAIN
CONTEXT
IS
THAT
OF
CHRISTIANITY
BUT
BY
ALL
MEANS
ADD
COMMENTS
AND
CORRECTIONS
AS
YOU
FIND
THEM
I
WROTE
A
LONGER
REPLY
ADDRESSING
SOME
OF
YOUR
POINTS
BUT
DECIDED
TO
NOT
POST
IT
PERHAPS
IT
WOULD
BE
MORE
APPROPRIATE
FOR
SOCRELIGION
EASTERN
INSTEAD
I
JUST
ADD
THE
FOLLOWING
COUPLE
OF
ITEMS
ABOUT
KARMA
AND
REINCARNATION
AS
I
SEE
THE
MATTER
FROM
AN
ANTHROPOSOPHICAL
AND
A
CHRISTIAN
POINT
OF
VIEW
KARMA
IS
NOT
SIMPLE
REWARD
AND
PUNISHMENT
DEALT
OUT
BY
A
JUDGING
DEITY
REINCARNATION
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
BEING
BORN
AGAIN
REINCARNATION
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
BODY
REINCARNATION
AND
KARMA
DO
NOT
CONTRADICT
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
TEACHINGS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
ABOUT
GOD
THE
FALL
THE
BEING
INCARNATION
DEATH
AND
RESURRECTION
OF
CHRIST
HIS
COMING
AGAIN
SIN
GRACE
FORGIVENESS
SALVATION
AND
THE
LAST
JUDGEMENT
ISNT
ORIGEN
USUALLY
CITED
AS
THE
MOST
PRESTIGIOUS
PROPONENT
OF
REINCARNATION
AMONG
CHRISTIAN
THINKERS
WHAT
WERE
HIS
VIEWS
AND
HOW
DID
HE
RELATE
THEM
TO
THE
CHRISTIAN
SCRIPTURES
JACK
CARROLL
ORIGENS
WORK
WAS
MOSTLY
LOST
HE
WAS
NOT
ANATHEMATIZED
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
BUT
HIS
WRITING
COMES
DOWN
LARGELY
IN
FRAGMENTS
AND
QUOTATIONS
FROM
ENEMIES
PERHAPS
SOMEONE
ELSE
CAN
COMMENT
ON
ORIGEN
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THERE
IS
A
SPECIFIC
STATEMENT
ABOUT
REINCARNATION
FROM
HIM
BUT
FROM
WHAT
I
DO
KNOW
ABOUT
HIM
HE
PROBABLY
DID
HOLD
TO
THE
TEACHING
IN
ONE
FORM
OR
ANOTHER
I
DONT
KNOW
TOO
MUCH
ABOUT
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
IDEA
OF
REINCARNATION
IN
THE
CHURCH
HOWEVER
I
HEARD
AN
INTERESTING
STORY
ABOUT
POPE
JOHN
PAUL
II
FROM
AN
ASTRONOMER
WHO
TEACHES
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
CRACOW
THE
POPE
LIKES
TO
GO
TO
POLAND
FOR
A
SCIENTIFIC
CONFERENCE
EVERY
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
SO
HE
CAN
RELAX
AND
TALK
POLISH
TO
FRIENDS
AND
FELLOW
COUNTRYMEN
MY
ACQUAINTANCE
AN
ANTHROPOSOPHIST
RELATED
THE
FACT
THAT
WOITILA
KNEW
ABOUT
STEINER
AND
ANTHROPOSOPHY
FROM
HIS
EARLY
DAYS
BEFORE
HE
BECAME
A
PRIEST
HE
WAS
AN
ACTOR
IN
A
DRAMATIC
COMPANY
IN
CRACOW
WHOSE
LEADER
WAS
A
PUPIL
OF
STEINER
AND
BASED
HIS
ACTING
AND
DIRECTING
METHODS
ON
STEINERS
INDICATIONS
PART
OF
THE
WORK
WAS
THE
STUDY
OF
THE
BASIC
WORKS
OF
ANTHROPOSOPHY
WELL
GOING
TO
THIS
CONFERENCE
WITH
HIM
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THE
ASTRONOMER
AND
ANOTHER
POLISH
ANTHROPOSOPHIST
THOUGHT
THEY
WOULD
ASK
THE
POPE
WHAT
HE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
ANTHROPOSOPHY
THEY
CHICKENED
OUT
AT
THE
LAST
MINUTE
BUT
ONE
OF
THEM
DID
ASK
HIM
WHAT
HE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
REINCARNATION
THE
POPE
SMILED
AND
SAID
ACTUALLY
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
QUITE
A
FEW
GOOD
CATHOLICS
WHO
BELIEVED
IN
REINCARNATION
AND
HE
PROCEEDED
TO
NAME
SEVERAL
FROM
THE
EARLIEST
TIMES
TO
MODERN
TIMES
THEN
HE
CHANGED
THE
SUBJECT
MY
POLISH
FRIEND
DID
NOT
SAY
WHETHER
ORIGEN
WAS
AMONG
THOSE
HE
MENTIONED
GERRY
PALO
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
ORIGEN
HIMSELF
WAS
NOT
ANATHEMATIZED
HE
WAS
CONTROVERSIAL
BUT
AVOIDED
OUTRIGHT
CONDEMNATION
DURING
HIS
LIFETIME
HOWEVER
SOME
OF
HIS
VIEWS
WERE
CONDEMNED
AT
A
COUNCIL
IN
ALEXANDRIA
IN
AND
TWO
COUNCILS
IN
CONSTANTINOPLE
IN
AND
I
AM
FAIRLY
SURE
THE
PREEXISTENCE
OF
SOULS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
DOCTRINES
CONDEMNED
