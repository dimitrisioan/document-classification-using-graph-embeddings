RE
LOSING
YOUR
TEMPER
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
TRAIT
FROM
ARTICLE
BY
RUTHLESSPANIXCOM
RUTH
DITUCCI
COMING
FROM
A
LONG
LINE
OF
HOT
TEMPERED
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
TEMPER
WHEN
I
SEE
IT
ONE
OF
THE
TELL
TALE
SIGNSFRUITS
THAT
GIVE
NONCHRISTIANS
AWAY
IS
WHEN
THEIR
NET
REPLIES
ARE
ACRID
ANGRY
AND
SARCASTIC
I
DO
HOPE
THAT
YOU
ARE
NOT
SUGGESTING
THAT
MERELY
BECAUSE
A
PERSON
REPLIES
IN
AN
ACRID
ANGRY
AND
SARCASTIC
MANNER
THAT
THIS
DEMONSTRATES
THEIR
NONCHRISTIANITY
THE
SIMPLE
FACT
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
ON
THE
FACE
OF
THE
PLANET
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
THAT
IS
PERFECT
I
HAVE
BEEN
KNOWN
AT
TIMES
TO
HAVE
A
FIT
OF
TEMPER
OR
A
SULK
BUT
THIS
DOES
NOT
MAKE
ME
ANY
THE
LESS
A
CHRISTIAN
ONE
OF
THE
POINTS
OF
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
AS
I
PERCEIVE
IT
IS
TO
BECOME
MORE
LIKE
CHRIST
THIS
STATEMENT
INHERENTLY
SUGGESTS
THAT
WE
ARE
NOT
ALREADY
LIKE
CHRIST
JESUS
NEVER
UNRIGHTEOUSLY
LOST
HIS
TEMPER
I
DO
JESUS
WAS
PERFECT
IM
NOT
WE
IN
THE
NET
VILLAGE
DO
HAVE
A
LAUGH
OR
TWO
WHEN
PROFESSED
BORN
AGAIN
CHRISTIANS
VERBALLY
ATTACK
PEOPLE
WHO
MIGHT
OTHERWISE
HAVE
BEEN
WON
TO
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HAD
ORIGINALLY
JOINED
THE
DISCUSSIONS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
SPIRITUALLY
HUNGRY
INSTEAD
OF
ANSWERING
QUESTIONS
WITH
SWEETNESS
AND
SINCERITY
THESE
CHRISITAN
NETWARRIORS
FLAME
THE
QUERIES
YOU
MUST
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
CHRISTIANS
OFTEN
FORGET
TO
TREAT
OTHERS
AS
OUR
ROLEMODEL
CHRIST
WOULD
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
HUMAN
AND
FALIBLE
I
FOR
ONE
DO
NOT
PRETEND
TO
BE
INFALIBLE
AND
I
HOPE
THAT
MY
FELLOWMEN
WILL
BEAR
WITH
ME
WHEN
I
MAKE
MISTAKES
THIS
SURELY
IS
NOT
TOO
MUCH
TO
ASK
WHEN
I
MAKE
EVERY
EFFORT
TO
BEAR
WITH
THEM
YOU
DONT
NEED
ANY
ENEMIES
YOU
ALREADY
DO
YOURSELVES
THE
GREATEST
HARM
AND
DONT
WE
KNOW
IT
AGAIN
I
SAY
FOOLISH
FOOLISH
FOOLISH
AGAIN
I
SAY
WE
ARE
ALL
HUMAN
TO
MY
BRETHREN
THIS
MS
DUTICCI
HAS
A
VALID
POINT
AND
WE
AS
CHRISTIANS
OUGHT
TO
HEED
THE
WARNING
IN
HER
ARTICLE
WE
OFTIMES
DISCREDIT
OURSELVES
AND
OUR
SAVIOUR
IN
THE
WAY
THAT
WE
TREAT
OTHERS
STRIVE
TOWARDS
THE
GOAL
SET
US
BY
OUR
LORD
BUT
IN
THE
MEANTIME
REMEMBER
THERE
IS
NO
CONDEMNATION
FOR
THOSE
WHO
ARE
IN
CHRIST
WHEN
YOU
BLOW
IT
GO
EASY
ON
YOURSELF
FORGIVE
YOURSELF
AS
YOUR
FATHER
IN
HEAVEN
FORGIVES
YOU
AND
REMEMBER
AND
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
I
FIRMLY
BEIEVE
AND
CLING
TO
ONE
DAY
WE
SHALL
SEE
HIM
FACE
TO
FACE
AND
IN
THAT
DAY
WE
SHALL
FINALLY
BE
PERFECTED
I
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
SEEING
YOU
