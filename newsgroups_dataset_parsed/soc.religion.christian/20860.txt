RE
SSPX
SCHISM
IN
ARTICLE
LARRY
L
OVERACKER
WRITES
YOU
ASK
WHERE
WE
ARE
I
WOULD
ECHO
THAT
QUESTION
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
BE
CONTENTIOUS
BUT
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
POPE
HAS
UNIVERSAL
JURISDICTION
AND
AUTHORITY
WHAT
AUTHORITY
DO
YOU
RELY
UPON
FOR
YOUR
DECISIONS
WHAT
PREVENTS
ME
FROM
CHOOSING
ANY
DOCTRINE
I
LIKE
AND
SAYING
THAT
PAPAL
DISAGREEMENT
IS
AN
ERROR
THAT
WILL
BE
RESOLVED
IN
TIME
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
TRUE
SINCE
COUNCILS
OF
BISHOPS
HAVE
BASICALLY
STOOD
BY
THE
POPE
THE
ULTIMATE
QUESTION
IS
THE
TRADITIONAL
THEOLOGY
OF
THE
CHURCH
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
RESIST
A
POPE
FOR
HIS
DEPARTURE
FROM
THE
TRADITIONAL
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
CHURCH
IF
COMMANDS
FROM
ANY
AUTHORITY
CONFLICT
WITH
TRADITION
THE
COMMANDS
MUST
BE
DISOBEYED
MY
OWN
VIEW
ON
THIS
IS
THAT
THIS
CONFLICT
COULD
ONLY
HAPPEN
IN
A
MAJOR
WAY
GOD
WOULD
NEVER
ALLOW
A
HAIRSPLITTING
SITUATION
TO
DEVELOP
IT
WOULD
BE
TOO
COMPLEX
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
FIGURE
OUT
I
DONT
VIEW
THE
PRESENT
SITUATION
IN
THE
CHURCH
AS
ANYTHING
EXTREMELY
COMPLICATED
RUN
THROUGH
A
LIST
OF
WHAT
HAS
HAPPENED
IN
THE
LAST
YEARS
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
AND
ANY
IMPARTIAL
OBSERVER
WILL
BE
AGHAST
IT
APPEARS
THAT
MUCH
OF
WHAT
LIES
AT
THE
HEART
OF
THIS
MATTER
IS
DISAGREEMENTS
OVER
WHAT
IS
TRADITION
AND
TRADITION
AND
ALSO
OVER
AUTHORITY
AND
DISCIPLINE
THE
PROBLEMS
STEM
FROM
A
GENERAL
WIDESPREAD
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
IN
MY
OPINION
MOST
CATHOLICS
KNOW
ABOUT
ZILCH
ABOUT
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
THIS
LEAVES
THEM
WIDE
OPEN
FOR
DESTRUCTION
BY
ERRING
BISHOPS
ITS
BASICALLY
THE
REFORMATION
PART
II
THERE
IS
NOT
EVEN
A
QUESTION
IN
MY
MIND
THAT
IN
SOME
RESPECTS
THE
SHARDS
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
ARE
CURRENTLY
BEING
TRAMPLED
UPON
BY
THE
CATHOLIC
HIERARCHY
I
COULD
GO
ON
LISTING
SHOCKING
THINGS
FOR
AN
HOUR
PROBABLY
TAKE
THE
SITUATION
IN
CAMPOS
BRAZIL
FOR
EXAMPLE
IM
READING
A
BOOK
ON
WHAT
HAPPENED
THERE
AFTER
VATICAN
COUNCIL
II
THE
BISHOP
ANTONIO
DE
CASTROMAYER
NEVER
INTRODUCED
ALL
THE
CHANGES
THAT
FOLLOWED
IN
THE
WAKE
OF
VATICAN
II
HE
KEPT
THE
TRADITIONAL
MASS
THE
SAME
OLD
CATECHISMS
ETC
HE
MADE
SURE
THE
PEOPLE
KNEW
THEIR
FAITH
THE
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGY
OF
OBEDIENCE
WHAT
MODERNISM
WAS
ETC
HE
INNOCULATED
THE
PEOPLE
AGAINST
WHAT
WAS
COMING
WELL
ONE
DAY
THE
ORDER
CAME
FROM
ROME
FOR
HIS
RETIREMENT
IT
CAME
WHEN
THE
POPE
WAS
SICK
BISHOP
DE
CASTROMAYER
WAITED
UNTIL
THE
POPE
RECOVERED
THEN
INQUIRED
WHETHER
THIS
COMMAND
WAS
WHAT
THE
POPE
REALLY
WANTED
OR
SOMETHING
THAT
SOME
LIBERAL
HAD
COMMANDED
IN
HIS
ABSENCE
THE
POPE
CONFIRMED
THE
DECISION
SO
THE
GOOD
BISHOP
RETIRED
THE
INJUSTICE
THAT
FOLLOWED
WAS
COMPLETELY
INCREDIBLE
A
NEW
BISHOP
WAS
INSTALLED
HE
PROCEEDED
TO
EXPEL
MOST
OF
BISHOP
DE
CASTROMAYERS
CLERGY
FROM
THEIR
CHURCHES
BECAUSE
THEY
REFUSED
TO
CELEBRATE
THE
NEW
MASS
THE
NEW
BISHOP
WOULD
VISIT
A
PARISH
AND
CELEBRATE
A
NEW
MASS
THE
PEOPLE
WOULD
PROMPTLY
WALK
OUT
OF
THE
CHURCH
EN
MASSE
THE
BISHOP
WAS
ENRAGED
BY
THIS
HE
USUALLY
RESORTED
TO
ENLISTING
THE
HELP
OF
THE
SECULAR
AUTHORITIES
TO
EJECT
THE
PRIEST
FROM
THE
CHURCH
THE
PRIESTS
WOULD
JUST
START
BUILDING
NEW
CHURCHES
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
COMPLETELY
BEHIND
THEM
THE
OLD
PARISHES
HAD
THE
NEW
MASS
AS
THE
BISHOP
DESIRED
AND
VIRTUALLY
NO
PARISHIONERS
THE
PRIME
MOTIVATION
FOR
ALL
THIS
WAS
COMPLETELY
ILLEGAL
ACCORDING
TO
CANON
LAW
NO
PRIEST
CAN
BE
PENALIZED
IN
ANY
WAY
FOR
SAYING
THE
TRADITIONAL
MASS
BECAUSE
OF
LEGISLATION
ENACTED
BY
POPE
SAINT
PIUS
V
NOR
IS
THERE
ANY
OBLIGATION
TO
SAY
THE
NEW
MASS
DURING
ALL
THIS
PROCESS
THE
PEOPLE
OF
CAMPOS
NOT
JUST
PRIVATE
INDIVIDUALS
BUT
INCLUDING
CIVIL
AUTHORITIES
WERE
CONSTANTLY
SENDING
PETITIONS
AND
LETTERS
TO
ROME
TO
DO
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
NEW
MODERNIST
BISHOP
NOTHING
WAS
EVER
DONE
NO
HELP
EVER
ARRIVED
FROM
ROME
EVENTUALLY
PRIESTS
WERE
KICKED
OUT
AND
ABOUT
PEOPLE
MY
QUESTION
TO
THE
SUPPORTERS
OF
SSPX
IS
THIS
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
THAT
YOUR
POSITIONS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
CHURCH
REFORMS
COULD
CHANGE
AND
BE
CONFORMED
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
POPE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
POPES
POSITION
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
AND
THAT
THE
LEADERS
OF
SSPX
DONT
JOINTLY
MAKE
SUCH
CHOICE
IF
NOT
THIS
APPEARS
TO
BE
CLAIMING
INFALLIBLE
TEACHING
AUTHORITY
IF
I
ADOPT
THE
VIEW
THAT
IM
NOT
WRONG
I
CANT
BE
WRONG
AND
THERES
NO
WAY
ILL
CHANGE
MY
MIND
YOU
MUST
CHANGE
YOURS
THAT
IVE
EITHER
LEFT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
OR
IT
HAS
LEFT
ME
IF
THE
POPE
DEFINES
CERTAIN
THINGS
EX
CATHEDRA
THAT
WOULD
BE
THE
END
OF
THE
CONTROVERSY
THAT
PROCESS
IS
ALL
VERY
WELL
UNDERSTOOD
IN
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGY
AND
ANYONE
WHO
DOESNT
GO
ALONG
WITH
IT
IS
AN
INSTANT
NONCATHOLIC
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
APPRECIATE
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
WORLD
IF
THEY
KNEW
THE
FAITH
AND
WHAT
OUR
BISHOPS
ARE
DOING
THEY
WOULD
BE
SHOCKED
WE
SOULD
ARGUE
FROM
NOW
UNTIL
THE
SECOND
COMING
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
REAL
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
OF
THE
CHURCH
IS
IF
THIS
WERE
A
SIMPLE
MATTER
EAST
AND
WEST
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SEPARATED
FOR
OVER
YEARS
THIS
ISNT
THE
CASE
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
THERE
IS
A
MASSIVE
BODY
OF
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
THE
POPES
OF
THE
LAST
YEARS
ARE
ESPECIALLY
RELEVANT
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
AT
ALL
WHAT
THE
TRADITIONAL
DOCTRINE
IS
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
TEACHING
MAGISTERIEUM
OF
THE
CHURCH
DID
NOT
ALLOW
ERROR
IN
TEACHINGS
REGARDING
FAITH
AND
MORALS
EVEN
IN
THE
SHORT
TERM
I
MAY
BE
WRONG
HERE
IM
NOT
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
THATS
HERESY
MORE
OR
LESS
ALTHOUGH
THEY
HAVE
DONE
A
GREAT
JOB
SINCE
THE
REFORMATION
THE
LAST
YEARS
HAVE
SEEN
SO
MANY
ERRORS
SPREAD
THAT
ITS
PITIFUL
INFALLIBILITY
RESTS
IN
THE
POPE
AND
IN
THE
CHURCH
AS
A
WHOLE
IN
THE
SHORT
TERM
A
POPE
OR
LARGE
SECTIONS
OF
THE
CHURCH
CAN
GO
ASTRAY
IN
FACT
THATS
WHAT
USUALLY
HAPPENS
DURING
A
MAJOR
HERESY
LARGE
SECTIONS
OF
THE
CHURCH
GO
ASTRAY
THE
POPE
HISTORICALLY
HAS
BEEN
MUCH
MORE
RELIABLE
EVERYTHING
WILL
ALWAYS
COME
BACK
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
EFFECT
OF
A
POPE
MAKING
AN
EX
CATHEDRA
STATEMENT
REGARDING
THE
SSPX
SITUATION
WOULD
IT
BE
HONORED
IF
NOT
HOW
DO
YOU
GET
AROUND
THE
FORMAL
DOCTRINE
OF
INFALLIBILITY
AGAIN
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
BE
CONTENTIONS
IM
TRYING
TO
UNDERSTAND
SINCE
IM
ORTHODOX
IVE
GOT
NO
REAL
VESTED
INTEREST
IN
THE
OUTCOME
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
YES
IT
WOULD
BE
HONORED
INFALLIBILITY
IS
INFALLIBILITY
BUT
WHAT
IS
HE
GOING
TO
DEFINE
THAT
THE
NEW
MASS
IS
A
BETTER
EXPRESSION
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
THAN
THE
OLD
THAT
SEX
EDUCATION
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
SCHOOLS
IS
WONDERFUL
THAT
ALL
RELIGIONS
ARE
WONDERFUL
EXCEPT
FOR
THAT
PROFESSED
BY
THE
POPES
PRIOR
TO
VATICAN
II
IT
DOES
IF
THE
COMMAND
WAS
LEGITIMATE
SSPX
DOES
NOT
VIEW
THE
POPES
COMMANDS
AS
LEGITIMATE
WHY
THIS
IS
A
VERY
SLIPPERY
SLOPE
NOT
REALLY
START
STUDYING
THE
MAJOR
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGIANS
OF
THE
LAST
YEARS
EVERYTHING
IS
VERY
WELL
SPELLED
OUT
THE
WEST
EXCELS
AT
CRITICAL
THOUGHT
REMEMBER
THATS
WHAT
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGIANS
HAVE
BEEN
BUSY
AT
FOR
CENTURIES
