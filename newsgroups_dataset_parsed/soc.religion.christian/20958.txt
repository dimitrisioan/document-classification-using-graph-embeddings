THIS
IS
WHY
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
SUBSTANCEABUSE
RECOVERY
PROGRAMS
INVOLVE
MEETING
PEOPLES
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
PROVIDE
SOME
EVIDENCE
NEXT
TIME
YOU
MAKE
A
CLAIM
LIKE
THIS
IN
PROGRAMS
LIKE
ALCOHOLICS
ANONYMOUS
ONE
OF
THE
STEPS
INVOLVES
ACKNOWLEDING
A
HIGHER
POWER
AA
AND
OTHER
ABUSE
RECOVERY
PROGRAMS
ARE
ACKNOWLEDGED
AS
BEING
AMONG
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
DELETIA
AND
SO
ON
I
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
RATHER
UNCLEAR
WHAT
I
WAS
ASKING
IS
THIS
PLEASE
SHOW
ME
THAT
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
SUBSTANCEABSURE
RECOVERY
PROGRAMS
INVOLVE
MEETINSG
PEOPLES
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
RATHER
THAN
MERELY
ATTEMPTING
TO
FILL
PEOPLES
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
AS
PERCIEVED
BY
THE
PEOPLE
AA
SRC
REGULARS
OR
SNOOPY
THIS
WILL
PROBABLY
INVOLVE
DEFINING
SPRITUAL
NEEDS
IS
IT
NOT
THAT
CLEAR
AND
SHOWING
THAT
SUCH
THINGS
EXIST
AND
HOW
THEY
CAN
BE
FILLED
ANNOTHER
TACK
YOU
MIGHT
TAKE
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
FULFILLING
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
MEANS
ACKNOWLEDGING
A
HIGHER
POWER
OF
SOME
SORT
THEN
SHOW
THAT
SYSTEMS
THAT
DO
REQUIRE
THIS
WORK
BETTER
THAN
OTHERWISE
IDENTICAL
SYSTEMS
THAT
DO
NOT
A
CORRELATION
HERE
WOULD
HELP
YOU
BUT
AS
YOU
POINT
OUT
THIS
MIGHT
JUST
BE
DEMONSTRATING
SWAPPING
ONE
CRUTCH
FOR
ANNOTHER
HOWEVER
I
DO
FEEL
THAT
RELIGION
IS
USUALLY
A
BETTER
CRUTCH
THAN
ALCHOHOL
AS
IT
IS
NOT
USUALLY
POISONOUS
I
HOPE
WITH
THAT
CLARIFICATION
MY
QUESTION
WILL
BE
ANSWERABLE
I
ACTUALLY
DID
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
STEP
PROGRAM
ITS
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
IT
DOES
RATHER
THAN
WHAT
IT
TRIES
TO
DO
THAT
MAKES
A
DIFFERENCE
TO
ME
DAN
JOHNSON
AND
GOD
SAID
JEEZE
THIS
IS
DULL
AND
IT
WAS
DULL
GENESIS
THESE
OPINIONS
PROBABLY
SHOW
WHAT
I
KNOW
