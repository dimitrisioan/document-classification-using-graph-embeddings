RE
WHAT
WAS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
IN
ARTICLE
JOE
MOORE
WRITES
SPEAKING
OF
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
OF
THE
BLESSED
VIRGIN
IT
WAS
A
GIFT
FROM
GOD
I
THINK
BASICALLY
THE
REASONING
WAS
THAT
THE
TRADITION
IN
THE
CHURCH
HELD
THAT
MARY
WAS
ALSO
WITHOUT
SIN
AS
WAS
JESUS
YES
FOR
EXAMPLES
OF
THIS
IN
THE
WRITINGS
OF
THE
EARLY
FATHERS
CONSIDER
YOU
ALONE
AND
YOUR
MOTHER
ARE
MORE
BEAUTIFUL
THAN
ANY
OTHERS
FOR
THERE
IS
NO
BLEMISH
IN
YOU
NOR
ANY
STAINS
UPON
YOUR
MOTHER
WHO
OF
MY
CHILDREN
CAN
COMPARE
IN
BEAUTY
TO
THESE
ST
EPHREM
THE
SYRIAN
NISIBENE
HYMNS
AROUND
AD
LIFT
ME
UP
NOT
FROM
SARA
BUT
FROM
MARY
A
VIRGIN
NOT
ONLY
UNDEFILED
BUT
A
VIRGIN
WHOM
GRACE
HAS
MADE
INVIOLATE
FREE
OF
EVERY
STAIN
OF
SIN
ST
AMBROSE
COMMENTARY
ON
PSALM
CA
AD
THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHERS
AS
THE
TENETS
OF
FAITH
DEVELOPED
PARTICULARLY
WITH
AUGUSTINE
SIN
WAS
MORE
AND
MORE
EQUATED
WITH
SEX
AND
THUS
MARY
WAS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
A
VIRGIN
FOR
LIFE
SINCE
SHE
NEVER
SINNED
AND
SINCE
SHE
WAS
THE
SPOUSE
OF
GOD
ETC
NO
WE
HAVE
FOR
INSTANCE
WAS
THERE
EVER
ANYONE
OF
ANY
BREEDING
WHO
DARED
TO
SPEAK
THE
NAME
OF
HOLY
MARY
AND
BEING
QUESTIONED
DID
NOT
IMMEDIATELY
ADD
THE
VIRGIN
AND
TO
HOLY
MARY
VIRGIN
IS
INVARIABLY
ADDED
FOR
THAT
HOLY
WOMAN
REMAINS
UNDEFILED
ST
EPIPHANUS
OF
SALAMIS
PANACEA
AGAINST
ALL
HERESIES
BETWEEN
AD
WE
SURELY
CANNOT
DENY
THAT
YOU
WERE
RIGHT
IN
CORRECTING
THE
DOCTRINE
ABOUT
CHILDREN
OF
MARY
FOR
THE
LORD
JESUS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
CHOSEN
TO
BE
BORN
OF
A
VIRGIN
IF
HE
HAD
JUDGED
THAT
SHE
WOULD
BE
SO
INCONTINENT
AS
TO
TAINT
THE
BIRTHPLACE
OF
THE
BODY
OF
THE
LORD
HOME
OF
THE
ETERNAL
KING
WITH
THE
SEED
OF
HUMAN
INTERCOURSE
ANYONE
WHO
PROPOSES
THIS
IS
MERELY
PROPOSING
THAT
CHRIST
COULD
NOT
BE
BORN
OF
A
VIRGIN
POPE
ST
SIRICIUS
LETTER
TO
ANYSIUS
BISHOP
OF
THESSALONICA
AD
NOTE
THAT
ST
AUGUSTINES
CONVERSION
TO
CHRISTIANITY
WAS
IN
AD
I
DONT
KNOW
OFFHAND
WHEN
HIS
ELECTION
AS
BISHOP
OF
HIPPO
WAS
BUT
IM
QUITE
SURE
IT
WAS
AFTER
THE
BELIEF
IN
MARYS
PERPETUAL
VIRGINITY
ORIGINATED
LONG
BEFORE
AUGUSTINES
TIME
WE
HOLD
THAT
IT
ORIGINATED
WITH
THE
APOSTLES
STRICTLY
SPEAKING
HOWEVER
MARYS
PERPETUAL
VIRGINITY
IS
INDEPENDENT
OF
HER
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
MARY
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
IMMACULATELY
CONCEIVED
AND
NOT
REMAINED
A
VIRGIN
SHE
COULD
HAVE
REMAINED
A
VIRGIN
AND
NOT
BEEN
IMMACULATELY
CONCEIVED
SINCE
WE
ALSO
HAD
THIS
NOTION
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
IE
THAT
MAN
IS
BORN
WITH
A
PREDISPOSITION
TO
SIN
AND
SINCE
MARY
DID
NOT
HAVE
THIS
PREDISPOSITION
BECAUSE
SHE
DID
NOT
EVER
SIN
SHE
DIDNT
HAVE
ORIGINAL
SIN
WHEN
SCIENCE
DISCOVERED
THE
PROCESS
OF
CONCEPTION
THE
NEXT
STEP
WAS
TO
ASSUME
THAT
MARY
WAS
CONCEIVED
WITHOUT
ORIGINAL
SIN
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
NO
IT
HAS
BEEN
HELD
IN
THE
CHURCH
SINCE
ANCIENT
TIMES
THAT
ORIGINAL
SIN
WAS
TRANSMITTED
AT
CONCEPTION
WHEN
A
PERSONS
LIFE
BEGINS
BIOLOGY
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
PRAYERFULLY
REFLECTING
ON
THE
TRUTH
OF
MARYS
SINLESSNESS
AND
THE
MEANS
BY
WHICH
GOD
COULD
HAVE
ACHIEVED
THIS
THE
CHURCH
ARRIVED
AT
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
THUS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
IS
NOT
A
NEW
DOCTRINE
BUT
THE
LOGICAL
RESULT
OF
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
TWO
OLD
ONES
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
FEAST
OF
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
ITSELF
WAS
GIVEN
BY
POPE
SIXTUS
IV
AND
THE
FEAST
WAS
MADE
A
PRECEPT
FEAST
OF
THE
CHURCH
BY
POPE
CLEMENT
XI
MARY
AT
THAT
TIME
APPEARED
TO
A
GIRL
NAMED
BERNADETTE
AT
LOURDES
SHE
REFERED
TO
HERSELF
AS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
SINCE
A
NINE
YEAR
OLD
WOULD
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
ABOUT
THE
DOCTRINE
THE
APPARITION
WAS
DEEMED
TO
BE
TRUE
AND
IT
SEALED
THE
CASE
FOR
THE
DOCTRINE
NO
FIRST
OF
ALL
LOURDES
IS
PRIVATE
REVELATION
AND
DOCTRINE
IS
NOT
BASED
ON
PRIVATE
REVELATION
THE
MOST
THAT
PRIVATE
REVELATION
CAN
DO
IS
ENHANCE
AND
DEEPEN
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
EXISTING
PUBLIC
REVELATION
WHICH
ENDED
WITH
THE
DEATH
OF
ST
JOHN
THE
APOSTLE
SECOND
THE
CASE
FOR
THE
DOCTRINE
WAS
IRREFORMABLY
SEALED
IN
WITH
THE
EX
CATHEDRA
PROMULGATION
OF
THE
BULL
INEFFABILIS
DEUS
BY
POPE
PIUS
IX
THIS
MEANT
THAT
THE
DOCTRINE
WAS
FORMALLY
RECOGNIZED
AS
A
DOGMA
A
DOGMA
BY
DEFINITION
CANNOT
CHANGE
AND
IS
REQUIRED
TO
BE
BELIEVED
BY
THE
FAITHFUL
THE
APPARITION
AT
LOURDES
HAPPENED
IN
FOUR
YEARS
LATER
THE
MOST
THAT
MIGHT
BE
CLAIMED
IS
THAT
LOURDES
GAVE
THE
INFALLIBLE
PROCLAMATION
OF
A
SORT
OF
HEAVENLY
STAMP
OF
APPROVAL
BUT
THE
CHURCH
HAS
NEVER
CLAIMED
THAT
NOR
SHALL
SHE
IN
CHRISTS
PEACE
BRAD

THOSE
WHO
TRUST
IN
HIM
SHALL
UNDERSTAND
TRUTH
AND
THE
FAITHFUL
SHALL
ABIDE
WITH
HIM
IN
LOVE
BECAUSE
GRACE
AND
MERCY
ARE
WITH
HIS
HOLY
ONES
