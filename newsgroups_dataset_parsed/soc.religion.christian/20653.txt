re
did
he
really
rise
in
article
michael
covington
writes
the
two
historic
facts
that
i
think
the
most
important
are
these
if
jesus
didnt
rise
from
the
dead
then
he
must
have
done
something
else
equally
impressive
in
order
to
create
the
observed
amount
of
impact
nobody
ever
displayed
the
dead
body
of
jesus
even
though
both
the
jewish
and
the
roman
authorities
would
have
gained
a
lot
by
doing
so
it
would
have
discredited
the
christians

a

internet

artificial

phone
the
university
of
georgia
fax
athens
georgia
usa
amateur
radio
and
the
two
simplest
refutations
are
these
what
impact
the
only
record
of
impact
comes
from
the
new
testament
i
have
no
guarantee
that
its
books
are
in
the
least
accurate
and
that
the
recorded
impact
actually
happened
i
find
it
interesting
that
no
other
contemporary
source
records
an
eclipse
an
earthquake
a
temple
curtain
being
torn
etc
the
earliest
written
claim
we
have
of
jesus
resurrection
is
from
the
pauline
epistles
none
of
which
were
written
sooner
than
years
after
the
supposed
event
it
seems
probable
that
no
one
displayed
the
body
of
jesus
because
no
one
knew
where
it
was
i
personally
believe
that
the
most
likely
explanation
was
that
the
body
was
stolen
by
disciples
or
by
graverobbers
dont
bother
with
the
point
about
the
guards
it
only
appears
in
one
gospel
and
seems
like
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
early
christians
might
make
up
in
order
to
counter
the
graverobbing
charge
the
new
testament
does
record
that
jews
believed
the
body
had
been
stolen
if
there
were
really
guards
they
could
not
have
effectively
made
this
claim
as
they
did
