BILL
REA
WRITES
IN
HISTORY
SEEMS
TO
IMPLY
SOME
PRETTY
SERIOUS
SIN
THE
ONE
OF
THE
PASTORS
IN
THE
CHURCH
I
ATTEND
CHRISTCHURCH
CITY
ELIM
CONSIDERS
THAT
A
PROPHESY
OF
A
NATURAL
DISASTER
AS
A
JUDGEMENT
FROM
THE
LORD
IS
A
CLEAR
SIGN
THAT
THE
PROPHESY
IS
NOT
FROM
THE
LORD
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
HIS
REASONING
BEHIND
THIS
YOU
MAY
HAVE
GOTTEN
BURNED
BY
NATURAL
DISASTER
PROPHECIES
DOWN
THERE
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
EVERY
NATURAL
DISASTERJUDGEMENT
PROPHECY
IS
FALSE
TAKE
A
QUICK
LOOK
AT
THE
BOOK
OF
JEREMIAH
AND
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
JUDGEMENT
PROPHECIES
CAN
BE
VALID
HERE
IN
THE
US
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
MORE
OF
A
PROBLEM
WITH
POSITIVE
PROPHECIES
THOUGH
I
AM
SURE
THERE
MAY
BE
A
FEW
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
TOO
INTO
JUDGEMENT
SOMETIMES
GOD
DOES
GIVE
WORDS
THAT
ARE
DIFFICULT
TO
SWALLOW
THE
RELATIVE
POSITIVENESS
OF
A
PROPHECY
IS
NOT
NECESARILY
GROUNDS
TO
DISMISS
IT
MUCH
OF
THE
OT
IS
NOT
HAPPY
