HEY
WE
CANT
DO
IT
GOD
HIMSELF
INSPIRES
US
TO
TURN
OUR
LIVES
OVER
TO
HIM
THATS
TUFF
AND
MOST
PEOPLE
DONT
WANT
TO
DO
IT
TO
BE
A
REAL
CHRISTIAN
WOULD
BE
SOMETHING
FOR
THE
STRONG
TO
PERSEVERE
AT
BUT
SO
YOU
THINK
IT
IS
EASY
TO
BE
A
MUSLIM
OR
BE
A
BUDDHIST
GOOD
POINTS
ON
BUDDHISM
ETC
DELETED
JUST
BECAUSE
ONE
SAYS
CHRISTIANITY
TRUE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
HARD
TO
FOLLOW
FAITHFULLY
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
ONE
DISCOUNTS
THE
VALIDITY
AND
DIFFICULTY
OF
OTHER
RELIGIONS
I
ADMIRE
THOSE
OF
ANY
RELIGION
WHO
ARE
WILLING
TO
MAKE
THE
KIND
OF
SACRIFICES
AND
DEDICATE
THEMSELVES
SPIRITUALLY
IN
THE
WAY
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
MORE
DELETED
AND
PERHAPS
SOME
MORE
BUT
LEAVE
THE
CRAP
IN
IT
OUT
WOMAN
WAS
CREATED
AFTER
MAN
TO
BE
HIS
HELPER
ETC
DO
YOU
THINK
THIS
IS
WHAT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
ALL
ABOUT
NOT
ALL
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
IN
THIS
PARTICULAR
STORY
LITERALLY
IT
SOUNDS
ABOVE
LIKE
YOU
ARE
SUPPORTING
A
POLICY
OF
TO
EACH
HIS
OWN
HERE
IS
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
OF
THAT
IF
IT
HELPS
SOMEONES
FAITH
TO
TAKE
EVERY
WORD
OF
THE
BIBLE
LITERALLY
I
SUPPORT
AND
RESPECT
THAT
TOO
TIME
WE
DONT
RUSH
IT
IN
ONE
DAY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
YOUR
WHOLE
LIFE
IT
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
CHURCH
ONCE
A
WEEK
OR
HELPING
POOR
PEOPLE
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
WE
BOX
EVERYTHING
INTO
TIME
UNITS
SUCH
AS
WORK
AT
THIS
TIME
SPORTS
TV
SOCIAL
LIFE
GOD
IS
ABOVE
THESE
BOXES
AND
SHOULD
BE
WHEN
EVER
I
TURN
ON
MY
TV
THERE
IS
THIS
PAT
ROBERTSON
AND
OTHER
BRAIN
WASHERS
OH
BOY
WHAT
AN
ACT
THEY
PUT
ON
WITH
AN
NUMBER
TO
TURN
IN
YOUR
PLEDGES
GOD
IT
SEEMS
IS
ALIVE
AND
WELL
INSIDE
THESE
BOXES
PLEASE
DONT
JUDGE
ALL
OF
CHRISTIANITY
BY
ONE
MAN
THE
ONLY
MAN
ONE
CAN
TRULY
JUDGE
ALL
OF
CHRISTIANITY
BY
IS
JESUS
MAKES
SENSE
RIGHT
I
THINK
HIS
POINT
ABOUT
HOW
WE
PUT
OUR
LIVES
INTO
LITTLE
BOXES
IS
VERY
TRUE
WHAT
DOES
YOUR
COMMENT
ABOUT
ROBERTSON
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
THAT
CARRIED
WITH
US
INTO
ALL
THESE
BOXES
THAT
WE
HAVE
CREATED
FOR
OURSELVES
PARTING
QUESTION
WOULD
YOU
HAVE
BECOME
A
CHRISTIAN
IF
YOU
HAD
NOT
BEEN
INDOCTRINATED
BY
YOUR
PARENTS
YOU
PROBABLY
NEVER
LEARNED
ABOUT
ANY
OTHER
RELIGION
TO
MAKE
A
COMPARATIVE
STUDY
AND
THEREFORE
I
CLAIM
YOU
ARE
BRAIN
WASHED
I
WAS
RAISED
AGNOSTIC
MY
FATHER
WAS
NEVER
BAPTISED
AND
WAS
RAISED
ATHEIST
HE
IS
NOT
AN
ATHEIST
BECAUSE
HE
FOUND
A
CLOSEMINDEDNESS
PRESENT
IN
THE
VIEWPOINT
OF
HIS
PARENTS
EQUAL
TO
THE
CLOSEMINDEDNESS
HE
FOUND
IN
THE
VIEWPOINT
OF
THE
CHRISTIANS
HE
CAME
IN
CONTACT
WITH
THUS
I
WAS
FREE
TO
CHOOSE
HOW
TO
LIVE
MY
LIFE
AND
HE
SUPPORTED
THE
DECISION
I
MADE
TO
JOIN
THE
EPISCOPAL
CHURCH
ALTHOUGH
HE
EMPHASIZED
TO
ME
THAT
HIS
RESPECT
FOR
MY
BELIEFS
SHOULD
RESULT
IN
MY
NOT
INTRUDING
ON
HIS
BELIEFS
IE
I
SHOULD
NOT
TRY
TO
CONVERT
HIM
AS
THAT
IS
HIS
DECISION
PLEASE
NO
FLAMES
OR
ADVICE
ON
HOW
TO
CONVERT
HIM
ONE
OF
MY
GOOD
FRIENDS
IS
HINDI
AND
I
GREATLY
RESPECT
HER
BELIEFS
AND
THE
CULTURE
SURROUNDING
HER
RELIGION
MY
BEST
FRIEND
IS
JEWISH
AND
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
HELD
A
PROFOUND
RESEPCT
FOR
THE
JEWISH
RELIGION
CHAIM
POTOK
AND
ISAAC
BASHEVIS
SINGER
ARE
TWO
OF
MY
FAVORITE
AUTHORS
I
REALLY
DO
NOT
THINK
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THAT
KIND
OF
GENERALIZATION
ABOUT
HOW
CHRISTIANS
CHOOSE
AND
I
DO
MEAN
CHOOSE
THEIR
FAITH
IF
THEY
HAVE
NOT
CONSCIOUSLY
ACCEPTED
THE
FAITH
IN
THEIR
ADULT
LIVES
WHICH
IS
WHAT
CONFIRMATION
REPRESENTS
THEN
YOU
CAN
TALK
ABOUT
THEIR
BEING
BRAINWASHED
VERA
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
NOT
TO
DECIDE
YOU
STILL
HAVE
MADE
A
CHOICE
RUSH
FREEWILL
