DEFINITION
OF

ALTHOUGH
SIMPLISTIC

HAVE
ALWAYS
LIKED
THE
FACT
THAT
A
CHRISTIAN
IS
ONE
WHO
NOT
ONLY
BELIEVES
IN

BELIEVES

AFTER
ALL
THE
NAME
WAS
FIRST
GIVEN
EXTERNALLY
TO
IDENTIFY
THOSE
WHO
PREACHED
CHRIST
AND
HIM
CRUCIFIED
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
OF
THEIR
REBELIION
AND
SHORTCOMINGS
BEFORE
GOD
GOD
SAID
THIS
WAS
HIS
SON
I
BELIVE
HIM
