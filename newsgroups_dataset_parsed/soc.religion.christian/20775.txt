FRASER
WRITES
WELL
YOU
KNOW
THAT
RELIGION
HAS
CAUSED
MORE
WARS
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
IT
BOTHERS
ME
THAT
I
CANNOT
SEEM
TO
FIND
A
SATISFACTORY
RESPONSE
TO
THIS
AFTER
ALL
IF
OUR
RELIGION
IS
ALL
ABOUT
PEACE
AND
LOVE
WHY
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
SO
MANY
RELIGIOUS
WARS
OF
COURSE
IF
THIS
QUESTION
WAS
ASKED
IN
A
GROUP
DEALING
WITH
ECONOMICS
THE
ANSWER
WOULD
BE
THAT
THE
CAUSE
OF
WAR
WAS
ECONOMIC
MY
OBSERVATIONS
OVER
THE
PAST
YEARS
AND
NOT
WITHSTANDING
A
LITTLE
HISTORY
READING
BESIDE
IS
THAT
WHILE
RELIGIOUS
DIFFERENCES
DO
PLAY
A
PART
IN
MANY
OF
THE
CONFLICTS
SO
DOES
UNFORTUNATELY
RACE
ECONOMICS
AND
ANY
OTHER
ITEMS
THAT
IDENTIFY
ONE
GROUP
OF
MEN
AS
BEING
DIFFERENT
FROM
ANOTHER
IF
WE
WANT
TO
COUCH
THE
CAUSE
OF
CONFLICT
IN
CHRISTIAN
TERMS
I
WOULD
PUT
IT
WHILE
CHRIST
DIED
FOR
OUR
SINS
WE
ARE
YET
SINNERS
WHILE
SOME
INDIVIDUALS
ASSUME
CHRISTLIKE
NATURES
MOST
OF
US
DO
NOT
EVEN
COME
CLOSE
I
REALIZE
THAT
IN
MANY
WAYS
THIS
IS
A
TRITE
ANSWER
BUT
I
GUESS
THAT
IT
IS
MY
WAY
OF
RATIONALIZING
MANS
CONSTANT
OR
SO
IT
SEEMS
CONFLICT
