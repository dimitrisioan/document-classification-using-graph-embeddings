COMMITTING
MY
LIFE
TO
GOD
HI
EVERYONE
IM
TRYING
TO
FIND
MY
WAY
TO
GOD
BUT
FIND
IT
DIFFICULT
AS
I
CANT
HEAR
GOD
TALKING
TO
ME
LETTING
ME
KNOW
THAT
HE
EXISTS
AND
IS
WITH
ME
AND
THAT
HE
KNOWS
ME
AND
I
FEEL
THAT
I
CANT
POSSIBLY
GET
TO
KNOW
HIM
UNTIL
HE
DOES
MAYBE
HE
IS
TALKING
TO
ME
BUT
I
JUST
DONT
KNOW
OR
UNDERSTAND
HOW
TO
LISTEN
SOME
CHRISTIANS
TELL
ME
THAT
IN
THEIR
OPINION
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
FIND
GOD
IS
TO
TAKE
A
PLUNGE
AND
COMMIT
YOUR
LIFE
TO
HIM
AND
YOU
WILL
DISCOVER
THIS
IDEA
OF
DIVING
INTO
THE
TOTALLY
UNKNOWN
IS
A
LITTLE
BIT
FRIGHTENING
BUT
I
HAVE
A
FEW
QUESTIONS
HOW
DO
YOU
ACTUALLY
COMMIT
YOURSELF
IF
I
JUST
SAY
OK
GOD
HER
YOU
GO
IM
COMMITTING
MY
LIFE
TO
YOU
I
WOULDNT
REALLY
FEEL
THAT
HED
LISTENED
AT
LEAST
I
COULDNT
BE
SURE
THAT
HE
HAD
SO
HOW
DOES
ONE
OR
HOW
DID
YOU
COMMIT
ONESELF
TO
GOD
IN
COMMITTING
MYSELF
IN
THIS
WAY
WHAT
DO
I
HAVE
TO
FORFEIT
OF
MY
CURRENT
LIFE
WHAT
CAN
I
NO
LONGER
DO
I
FEEL
THAT
IM
AS
GOOD
AS
MANY
CHRISTIANS
AND
I
TRY
TO
UPHOLD
THE
IDEA
OF
LOVING
YOUR
NEIGHBOUR
I
DONT
GO
ROUND
KILLING
PEOPLE
STEALING
ETC
AND
I
TRY
NOT
TO
GET
JEALOUS
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
IN
ANY
WAY
AND
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
I
KEEP
TO
THE
STANDARDS
OF
TREATING
OTHER
PEOPLE
AS
WELL
AS
MANY
CHRISTIANS
SO
WHAT
DO
I
HAVE
TO
GIVE
UP
WHEN
COMMITTED
WHAT
DO
I
HAVE
TO
DO
WHAT
DOES
IT
INVOLVE
WHAT
IF
ANY
BURDENS
AM
I
TAKING
ON
SO
THEN
WHATS
THE
GENERAL
DIFFERENCE
BEFORE
AND
AFTER
I
ASSUME
THAT
LIKE
ON
YOUR
BIRTHDAY
YOU
DONT
SUDDENLY
FEEL
A
YEAR
OLDER
IT
WONT
SUDDENLY
CHANGE
MY
LIFE
THE
DAY
I
COMMIT
MYSELF
SO
WHAT
HAPPENS
HOW
CAN
I
BE
SURE
THAT
IT
IS
THE
RIGHT
THING
TO
DO
HOW
CAN
I
FIND
OUT
WHAT
THE
IT
IN
THE
LAST
SENTENCE
ACTUALLY
IS
THANKS
VERY
MUCH
FOR
ALL
YOUR
HELP
IN
ANSWERING
THESE
QUESTIONS
PERHAPS
EMAIL
WOULD
BE
A
BETTER
WAY
TO
REPLY
BUT
ITS
UP
TO
YOU
