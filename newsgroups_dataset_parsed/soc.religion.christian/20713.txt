WHEN
ARE

PEOPLE
MARRIED

RICHARD

SZANTO
WRITES
IN
A
PREVIOUS
ARTICLE
ROBERT
ANDERSON
SAYS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
YOUR
OPINIONS
ON
THIS
WHEN
EXACTLY
DOES
AN
ENGAGED
COUPLE
BECOME
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
SOME
SAY
THAT
IF
THE
TWO
HAVE
PUBLICALLY
ANNOUNCED
THEIR
PLANS
TO
MARRY
HAVE
MADE
THEIR
VOWS
TO
GOD
AND
ARE
UNSWERVINGLY
COMMITTED
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
I
REALIZE
THIS
IS
A
SUBJECTIVE
QUALIFIER
THEY
ARE
MARRIEDJOINED
IN
GODS
SIGHT
I
HAVE
DISCUSSED
THIS
WITH
MY
GIRLFRIEND
OFTEN
I
CONSIDER
MYSELF
MARRIED
THOUGH
LEGALLY
I
AM
NOT
NEITHER
OF
US
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLE
SEXUALLY
ALTHOUGH
WE
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
EACH
OTHER
WE
DID
NOT
HAVE
SEXUAL
RELATIONS
UNTIL
WE
DECIDED
TO
MARRY
EVENTUALLY
FOR
FINANCIAL
AND
DISTANCE
REASONS
WE
WILL
NOT
BE
LEGALLY
MARRIED
FOR
ANOTHER
YEAR
AND
A
HALF
UNTIL
THEN
I
CONSIDER
MYSELF
MARRIED
FOR
LIFE
IN
GODS
EYES
I
HAVE
FAITH
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
STRONG
RELATIONSHIP
AND
HAVE
HAD
FOR
OVER
YEARS
AND
WILL
BE
FULL
OF
JOY
WHEN
WE
MARRY
IN
A
CHURCH
FIRST
HOWEVER
WE
MUST
FIND
A
CHURCH
WE
WILL
BE
LIVING
IN
A
NEW
AREA
WHEN
WE
MARRY
AND
WILL
NEED
TO
FIND
A
NEW
CHURCH
COMMUNITY
ANYWAY
I
FEEL
THAT
IF
TWO
PEOPLE
COMMIT
TO
MARRIAGE
BEFORE
GOD
THEY
ARE
MARRIED
AND
ARE
BOUND
BY
THAT
COMMITMENT
RICK
SZANTO
RICK
HAS
NAILED
THE
PROBLEM
DOWN
PRETTY
WELL
AS
I
CAN
FIND
NO
SCRIPTURE
HAVE
I
MISSED
IT
THAT
DETAILS
WHEN
YOU
ARE
MARRIED
I
HAVE
TO
MAKE
SOME
ASSUMPTIONS
BASED
ON
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
SCRIPTURE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
IT
TAKES
PARTIES
TO
MAKE
A
MARRIAGE
HUSBANDTOBE
WIFETOBE
AND
GOD
IF
YOU
PROMISE
BEFORE
EACH
OTHER
AND
GOD
THAT
YOU
WILL
CONVENANT
TOGETHER
TO
BE
MARRIED
THENYOU
ARE
IMO
SO
WHY
DO
WE
HAVE
THE
CEREMONIAL
PART
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THERE
FOR
CONNECTEDNESS
IN
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
MY
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
OUGHT
TO
BE
INVOLVED
SO
THAT
THERE
CAN
BE
SOME
ACCOUNTABILITY
ON
BOTH
OUR
PARTS
THATS
PART
OF
THE
CONCEPT
FROM
HEBREWS
ABOUT
NOT
FORSAKING
THE
ASSEMBLING
OF
YOURSELVES
TOGETHER
AS
IS
THE
CUSTOM
OF
SOME
WE
NEED
EACH
OTHER
BECAUSE
LONE
RANGER
CHRISTIANS
AND
LONE
RANGER
MARRIAGES
SMACK
OF
A
SELF
SUFFICIENCY
THAT
THE
I
DONT
SEE
IN
THE
NT
DOES
ANYONE
SEE
THE
PAUL
SIMON
I
AM
A
ROCK
I
AM
AN
ISLAND
MODEL
ANYWHERE
IN
CHRISTIANITY
SONG
LYRICS
SHOW
YOUR
AGE
FURTHER
SINCE
MARRIAGE
IS
A
LEGAL
MATTERINSTITUTION
IN
THE
USA
AND
MANY
OTHER
PLACES
AND
SUCH
LAWS
DO
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
GO
CROSSWISE
TO
THE
CLEAR
TEACHINGS
OF
SCRIPTURE
WE
OUGHT
TO
OBEY
THEM
TO
AVOID
EVEN
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
EVIL
I
THESS
SO
THIS
WOULD
IMPLY
AT
LEAST
A
CIVIL
CEREMONY
BEFORE
MARRIAGE
BUT
KEEP
IN
MIND
WE
ARE
AT
LEAST
DOING
ALL
OF
THIS
FOR
THE
CONSCIENCE
OF
OTHERS
BECAUSE
BACK
TO
THE
BEGINNINGYOU
ARE
MARRIED
WHEN
YOU
AND
YOUR
INTENDED
PROMISE
EACH
OTHER
AND
GOD
TO
BE
IN
CONVENANT
IMO
WHAT
CHALL
THINK
BOBBY
AKGUARJB
IN
SOME
STATES
THE
KIND
OF
COMMITMENT
DESCRIBED
IN
RICHARD
SZANTOS
POSTING
CAN
CREATE
A
COMMON
LAW
MARRIAGE
INDEED
HIS
POSTING
ITSELF
MIGHT
GO
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARDS
ESTABLISHING
THAT
A
MARRIAGE
EXISTS
SHOULD
THE
ISSUE
EVER
END
UP
IN
COURT
HE
MIGHT
WANT
TO
CONSULT
A
LAWYER
WHO
IS
FAMILIAR
WITH
COMMON
LAW
MARRIAGE
IN
HIS
STATE
