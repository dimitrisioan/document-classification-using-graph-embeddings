NATURE
OF
GOD
RE
ENVIRONMENTALISM
AND
PAGANISM
IN
ARTICLE
MICHAEL
COVINGTON
WRITES
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
CHRISTIANS
DEVOTE
A
BIT
LESS
EFFORT
TO
BASHING
PAGANISM
AND
MORE
TO
FIGURING
OUT
HOW
TO
PRESENT
THE
GOSPEL
TO
PAGANS
CHRIST
IS
THE
ANSWER
THE
PAGANS
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
THE
RIGHT
QUESTIONS
UNLIKE
MATERIALISTS
WHO
DENY
THE
NEED
FOR
ANY
SPIRITUALITY
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
I
FIND
INTERSTING
ABOUT
PAGAN
BELIEFS
IS
THEIR
BELIEF
IN
A
FEMININE
DEITY
AS
WELL
AS
A
MASCULINE
DEITY
BEING
BROUGHT
UP
IN
A
CHRISTIAN
HOUSEHOLD
I
OFTEN
WONDERED
IF
THERE
WAS
GOD
THE
FATHER
WHERE
WAS
THE
MOTHER
EVERYONE
I
KNOW
WHO
HAS
A
FATHER
USUALLY
AS
A
MOTHER
IT
JUST
SEEMED
RATHER
UNBALANCED
TO
ME
FORTUNATELY
MY
OWN
PERSONAL
THEOLOGY
WHICH
WILL
PROBABLY
NOT
FALL
INTO
LINE
WITH
A
LOT
OTHERS
RECOGNIZED
GOD
AS
A
BEING
BOTH
WITHOUT
GENDER
AND
POSESSING
QUALITIES
OF
BOTH
GENDERS
AS
BEING
BOTH
A
MASCULINE
AND
FEMININE
FORCE
IT
PROVIDES
A
SENSE
OF
BALANCE
I
FIND
SORELY
LACKING
IN
MOST
THEOLOGIES
A
LACK
WHICH
I
THINK
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
A
LOT
OF
THE
UNBALANCED
WAYS
IN
WHICH
WE
SEE
THE
WORLD
AND
TREAT
EACH
OTHER
TERRANCE
