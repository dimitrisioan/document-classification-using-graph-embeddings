ON
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
IN
ARTICLE
MMHDCSQMWACUK
MATTHEW
HUNTBACH
WRITES
I
WOULD
SAY
ONLY
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
THE
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
NEITHER
APPROVES
NOR
DISAPPROVES
OF
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
AS
CONFIRMED
IN
THE
RECENT
CATECHISM
THOUGH
THERE
ARE
MANY
RCS
WHO
WERE
RATHER
SURPRISED
AND
UPSET
THAT
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
WAS
NOT
EXPLICITLY
CONDEMNED
I
QUOTE
FROM
THE
JOURNAL
DAYS
IN
THE
CHURCH
AND
IN
THE
WORLD
NO
P
REGARDING
THE
NEW
DRAFT
OF
THE
UNIVERSAL
CATECHISM
IN
PROCURING
THE
COMMON
GOOD
OF
SOCIETY
THE
NEED
COULD
ARISE
THAT
THE
AGGRESSOR
BE
PLACED
IN
THE
POSITION
WHERE
HE
CANNOT
CAUSE
HARM
BY
VIRTUE
OF
THIS
THE
RIGHT
AND
OBLIGATION
OF
PUBLIC
AUTHORITIES
TO
PUNISH
WITH
PROPORTIONATE
PENALTIES
INCLUDING
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
IS
ACKNOWLEDGED
FOR
SIMILAR
REASONS
LEGIMATE
AUTHORITIES
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
IMPEDE
AGGRESSORS
IN
SOCIETY
WITH
THE
USE
OF
ARMS
THE
CHURCHS
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
EXPRESSED
AND
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
BE
EXPRESSED
IN
THE
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
REAL
CONDITIONS
OF
COMMON
GOOD
AND
THE
EFFECTIVE
MEANS
FOR
PRESERVING
PUBLIC
ORDER
AND
PERSONAL
SAFETY
TO
THE
DEGREE
THAT
MEANS
OTHER
THAN
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
AND
MILITARY
OPERATIONS
ARE
SUFFICIENT
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
THEN
THESE
NONVIOLENT
PROVISIONS
ARE
TO
BE
PREFERRED
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
MORE
IN
PROPORTION
AND
IN
KEEPING
WITH
THE
FINAL
GOAL
OF
PROTECTION
OF
PEACE
AND
HUMAN
DIGNITY
AS
IS
CLEARLY
SHOWN
BY
THIS
EXCERPT
THE
CHURCHS
TEACHING
ON
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
REMAINS
TODAY
AS
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
IN
THE
PAST
IN
TOTAL
ACCORD
WITH
MY
SENTIMENT
THAT
I
DO
NOT
DISAGREE
WITH
THE
USE
OF
DEADLY
FORCE
IN
THOSE
CASES
FOR
WHICH
THIS
OPTION
IS
JUSTIFIABLE
I
DO
NOT
THINK
YOUR
BIBLICAL
QUOTE
CAN
AUTOMATICALLY
BE
TAKEN
AS
SUPPORT
FOR
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
I
TAKE
IT
THAT
AS
A
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
YOU
ARE
OPPOSED
TO
ABORTION
AND
WOULD
STILL
ONSIDER
IT
WRONG
AND
SOMETHING
TO
BE
OBJECTED
TO
EVEN
IF
LEGALISED
BY
AUTHORITY
I
SEEK
TO
CONFORM
MY
WILL
TO
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
AS
EXPOUNDED
BY
HIS
INSTRUMENT
OF
THE
VISIBLE
CHURCH
HERE
ON
EARTH
WHENEVER
THE
QUESTION
OF
FAITH
OR
MORALS
ARISES
