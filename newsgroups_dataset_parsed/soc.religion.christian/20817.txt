RE
CERTAINTY
AND
ARROGANCE
RESPONDING
TO
THE
MODERATOR
IN
ARTICLE
ALVINSPOTCOLORADOEDU
KENNETH
ALVIN
WRITES
CHOOSING
WHAT
TO
BELIEVE
AND
RELY
ON
ARE
IMPORTANT
AREAS
OF
PERSONAL
SOVEREIGNTY
WHAT
BOTHERS
ME
IS
WHEN
OTHERS
SUGGEST
THAT
IN
THESE
MATTERS
OF
FAITH
THEIR
SPECIFIC
BELIEFS
ARE
NOT
ONLY
TRUE
TO
THEM
BUT
ARE
ABSOLUTE
AND
SHOULD
BE
BINDING
ON
OTHERS
IT
FOLLOWS
FROM
THIS
THAT
GOD
MUST
GIVE
EVERYONE
THE
SAME
REVELATION
OF
TRUTH
AND
THUS
ANYONE
WHO
COMES
TO
A
DIFFERENT
CONCLUSION
IS
INTENTIONALLY
CHOOSING
THE
WRONG
PATH
THIS
IS
THE
ARROGANCE
I
SEE
A
LACK
OF
RESPECT
FOR
THE
HONEST
CONCLUSIONS
OF
OTHERS
ON
MATTERS
WHICH
ARE
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
GOD
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
REASONABLE
TO
ASK
FOR
SOME
HUMILITY
ABOUT
OUR
OWN
ABILITY
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
THERE
ARE
ALSO
DIFFERENT
PATHS
IN
SOME
AREAS
OF
PRACTICE
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
MORE
CLARIFICATION
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
WHEN
YOU
REJECT
THE
IDEA
OF
SAYING
THEIR
SPECIFIC
BELIEFS
ARE
NOT
ONLY
TRUE
TO
THEM
BUT
ARE
ABSOLUTE
AND
SHOULD
BE
BINDING
ON
OTHERS
IF
SOMETHING
IS
TRUE
IT
IS
TRUE
FOR
EVERYONE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
BELIEF
IS
SOMETHING
ABOUT
GOD
HISTORY
ETC
YES
I
AGREE
WHAT
IM
TRYING
TO
POINT
OUT
IS
THAT
IN
MATTERS
OF
FAITH
IE
TENETS
WHICH
ARE
NOT
LOGICALLY
PERSUASIVE
ONE
MAY
BE
CONVINCED
OF
THE
TRUTH
OF
CERTAIN
THINGS
THROUGH
FOR
INSTANCE
PERSONAL
REVELATION
AND
ITS
CERTAINLY
FINE
TO
SHARE
THAT
REVELATION
OR
THOSE
BELIEFS
WITH
OTHERS
AND
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
ITS
ARROGANT
PERSAY
TO
ACCEPTS
MATTERS
OF
PURE
FAITH
AS
TRUTH
FOR
ONESELF
WHERE
I
THINK
THE
CONFLICT
ARISES
IS
IN
ASSUMING
THAT
WHERE
DISAGREEMENTS
ON
BELIEFS
ARISE
ALL
OTHERS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
GIVEN
THE
SAME
TRUTH
AND
THAT
GOD
MUST
REVEAL
HIS
TRUTH
TO
EVERYONE
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
ALL
WOULD
HONESTLY
AGREE
I
THINK
THIS
CAN
LEAD
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
DISAGREES
WITH
YOU
ARE
BEING
SINFUL
OR
DISHONEST
THAT
THEY
ARE
REJECTING
SOMETHING
THEY
KNOW
TO
BE
TRUTH
BECAUSE
IT
IS
INCONVENIENT
FOR
THEM
OR
BECAUSE
THEY
WISH
TO
SPURN
GOD
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THIS
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
ASSUMING
THAT
ALL
TRUTHS
ONE
HOLDS
ARE
UNIVERSAL
AND
ABSOLUTE
AND
THE
PROBLEM
I
SEE
WITH
THIS
IS
THAT
IT
NEGATES
THE
INDIVIDUALITY
OF
HUMANS
AND
THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS
WITH
GOD
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THERE
IS
NO
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
JUST
THAT
SOME
AREAS
OF
DOCTRINAL
DISAGREEMENT
MAY
BE
AREAS
WHERE
GOD
HAS
NOT
ESTABLISHED
OR
REVEALED
THAT
TRUTH
COMMENTS
CRITICISM
WELCOME
KEN
ALVINUCSUCOLORADOEDU
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
