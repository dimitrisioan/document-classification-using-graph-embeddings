II
WRITES
GOODNESS
THAT
IS
WITHIN
THE
POWER
OF
EACH
OF
US
NOW
THE
COMPLICATION
IS
THAT
ONE
OF
MY
BEST
FRIENDS
HAS
BECOME
VERY
FUNDAMENTALIST
THAT
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
A
NONISSUE
WITH
ME
BUT
HE
HELLO
FIRSTLY
WHAT
DO
YOU
EXACTLY
MEAN
BY
FUNDAMENTALIST
I
WILL
FOR
THE
TIME
BEING
ASSUME
THAT
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
IS
THAT
YOUR
FRIEND
BELIEVES
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
GODS
WORD
TO
MANKIND
I
SUSPECT
THAT
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
HIM
IS
WHAT
HELL
CALL
BEING
BORN
AGAIN
ANYWAY
WAS
THAT
RECENT
IF
THE
ANSWER
IS
YES
TO
ALL
THE
QUESTIONS
ABOVE
IT
IS
QUITE
UNDERSTANDABLE
HOWEVER
IMO
ILD
RATHER
GIVE
ADVICE
TO
YOUR
FRIEND
I
THINK
IVE
BEEN
THROUGH
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
TO
HIM
AND
ONE
THING
I
CAN
SAY
IS
THAT
THE
BASIC
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
EACH
OF
YOU
ARE
NOW
TRYING
TO
COMMUNICATE
FROM
DIFFERENT
WORLDVIEWS
WHY
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
THOSE
THINGS
IS
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOW
OBVIOUS
TO
HIM
WHAT
IS
OBVIOUS
TO
HIM
IS
NOT
OBVIOUS
TO
YOU
SECONDLY
WHY
HE
MAY
BE
VERY
PERSUASIVE
IS
BECAUSE
FROM
HIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
HE
HAS
BEEN
ON
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
FENCE
THIS
I
MEAN
THAT
BEFORE
HE
TURNED
FUNDAMENTALIST
YOU
TWO
ARE
AGREEABLE
BECAUSE
BOTH
OF
YOU
SEE
THINGS
FROM
THE
SAME
SIDE
IF
SUDDENLY
AS
IF
A
NEW
WORLD
OF
REALITY
HAS
SUDDENLY
OPENED
UP
TO
HIM
IT
IS
LIKE
THE
DISCOVERY
OF
LETS
SAY
A
NEW
CONTINENT
OR
A
NEW
PLANET
TO
HIM
HES
GOT
TO
TELL
YOU
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
SEEN
SOMETHING
MUCH
MORE
WONDERFUL
THAN
WHERE
HE
WAS
AND
WHAT
HE
THINKS
IS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
WHERE
YOU
ARE
NOW
YOU
HAVE
GOT
TO
REALISE
THAT
FROM
HIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
HE
MEANS
WELL
TO
YOU
EVENTHOUGH
HE
MAY
END
UP
OFFENDING
YOU
TO
HIM
IT
IS
WORTH
THAT
RISK
NEVERTHELESS
IT
IS
REALLY
UP
TO
HIM
TO
RESPECT
WHERE
YOU
STAND
AND
LISTEN
TO
YOU
AS
WELL
AT
THIS
MOMENT
IT
MAY
BE
DIFFICULT
BECAUSE
HE
IS
EITHER
VERY
EXCITED
OR
FEEL
IT
IS
TOO
URGENT
TO
KEEP
QUIET
ABOUT
HOWEVER
HE
MAY
NOT
REALISE
THAT
HES
REALLY
PUTTING
YOU
OFF
THE
BIBLE
THAT
IT
IS
SO
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
HOW
CAN
I
CONVINCE
HIM
THAT
THIS
IS
A
SUBJECT
BETTER
LEFT
UNDISCUSSED
SO
WE
CAN
PRESERVE
WHAT
IS
IN
ALL
AREAS
OTHER
THAN
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
A
GREAT
FRIENDSHIP
HOW
DO
I
CONVINCE
HIM
THAT
I
AM
BEYOND
SAVING
SO
HE
WONT
TRY
THANKS
FOR
ANY
ADVICE
SO
FAR
IVE
ONLY
BEEN
TRYING
TO
EXPLAIN
THINGS
FROM
HIS
SIDE
HOWEVER
I
DO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
YOU
FEEL
TOO
BECAUSE
I
WASNT
A
CHRISTIAN
FOR
A
GOOD
PART
OF
MY
LIFE
AS
WELL
I
WAS
QUITE
TURNED
OFF
BY
CHRISTIANS
OR
FUNDAMENTALISTS
WHO
WERE
REALLY
ALL
OUT
AND
ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT
THEIR
FAITH
THEY
REALLY
SCARED
ME
TO
TELL
YOU
THE
TRUTH
UNFORTUNATELY
RELIGIOUS
BELIEF
IS
A
VERY
PERSONAL
THING
JUST
AS
YOUR
AGNOSTICISM
IS
ALSO
A
VERY
PERSONAL
THING
TO
YOU
SINCE
THE
CHRISTIAN
BELIEF
IS
INEVITABLY
AT
ODDS
WITH
ANYTHING
NONCHRISTIAN
RELIGIOUS
OR
OTHERWISE
IT
WILL
BE
A
TOUCHY
MATTER
LIKE
ALL
FRIENDSHIPS
IT
WILL
TAKE
BOTH
SIDES
TO
DO
THEIR
PART
TO
MAKE
IT
WORK
IN
THIS
MATTER
MAYBE
YOU
CAN
DO
YOUR
PART
BY
TELLING
HIM
NICELY
THAT
YOU
ARE
NOT
ABLE
TO
DIG
WHAT
HES
TRYING
TO
CONVINCE
YOU
ABOUT
THAT
ITS
BEYOND
YOU
OR
NOT
YOUR
CONCERN
FOR
NOW
DONT
TELL
HIM
ITS
NONSENSE
BECAUSE
TO
HIM
IT
IS
REALITY
AND
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
REAL
INSULT
HELL
ALSO
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFUL
NOT
TO
INSULT
WHERE
YOU
STAND
TOO
LIKE
I
SAID
BEFORE
I
WISH
I
COULD
GIVE
YOUR
FRIEND
SOME
ADVICE
TOO
ILL
ADMIT
THAT
I
DID
SIMILARLY
TO
SOME
OF
MY
FRIENDS
WHEN
I
BECAME
A
CHRISTIAN
IN
SOME
WAYS
I
WISH
I
COULD
HAVE
DONE
THINGS
A
LITTLE
DIFFERENTLY
HOWEVER
IT
WAS
DIFFICULT
THEN
BECAUSE
I
WAS
SO
EXCITED
AND
JUST
BLABBERED
AWAY
ABOUT
WHAT
IVE
FOUND
TO
ME
IT
WAS
TOO
GOOD
NOT
TO
KNOW
TO
SOME
I
WAS
CRAZY
AND
I
DIDNT
REALLY
CARE
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
WHAT
THEY
THOUGHT
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
THINK
HES
CRAZY
TOO
BUT
GOD
IS
VERY
REAL
TO
HIM
AS
REAL
AS
YOU
ARE
TO
HIM
KEEP
THAT
IN
MIND
AND
HE
THINKS
HE
CAN
CONVINCE
YOU
BECAUSE
SINCE
GOD
IS
SO
REAL
TO
HIM
HE
DOESNT
SEE
WHY
GOD
CANT
BE
REAL
TO
YOU
TOO
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
HELPFUL
THIS
IS
TO
YOU
BUT
ALL
THE
BEST
ANYHOW
THIS
IS
QUITE
A
CHALLENGE
FOR
YOU
TO
FACE
BY
THE
WAY
PERSONAL
CONVICTION
NOBODY
IS
BEYOND
SAVING
EXCEPT
THE
ONE
WE
CALL
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
HOSTS
