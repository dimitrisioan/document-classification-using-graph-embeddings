RE
POST
JON
OGDEN
WRITES
MY
ADVICE
IS
THIS
IF
YOU
KNOW
SOMEONE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
THE
HOTS
FOR
WHO
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
BEFRIEND
THEM
AND
TRY
TO
DEVELOP
JUST
A
FRIENDSHIP
WITH
THEM
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
WITNESS
AND
SHARE
THE
GOSPEL
WITH
THEM
NOT
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
DATE
THEM
BUT
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
BE
SAVED
ONCE
THEY
BECOME
A
CHRISTIAN
THEN
IT
IS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
TO
LET
THE
RELATIONSHIP
PROGRESS
BEYOND
FRIENDSHIP
HOWEVER
IF
THEY
DONT
ACCEPT
CHRIST
YOU
STILL
HAVE
A
GOOD
FRIENDSHIP
AND
YOU
HAVENT
WASTED
A
LOT
OF
EMOTIONAL
ENERGY
AND
GOTTEN
HURT
WHILE
I
AGREE
WITH
MOST
OF
JON
SAYS
I
DELETED
THOSE
PARTS
OF
COURSE
I
HAVE
SERIOUS
RESERVATIONS
ABOUT
THIS
ADVICE
MAINTAINING
A
JUST
FRIENDS
LEVEL
OF
RELATIONSHIP
IS
MUCH
EASIER
SAID
THAN
DONE
PEOPLE
USUALLY
END
UP
GETTING
HURT
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
LIKELY
TO
HAPPEN
WHEN
THEY
START
OFF
WITH
FEELINGS
OF
ATTRACTION
WHEN
PEOPLE
FEEL
ATTRACTED
THOSE
FEELINGS
CAN
CLOUD
THEIR
JUDGEMENT
IVE
HAD
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
GOING
QUICKLY
FROM
BELIEVING
THAT
I
SHOULDNT
DATE
NONCHRISTIANS
TO
BELIEVING
THAT
DATING
THIS
MAN
WOULD
BE
OKAY
TO
BELIEVING
THAT
PREMARITAL
SEX
IS
FINE
WHEN
PEOPLE
REALLY
LOVE
EACH
OTHER
WHEN
THE
RELATIONSHIP
ENDED
MY
BELIEFS
IMMEDIATELY
RETURNED
TO
THEIR
ORIGINAL
STATE
THIS
IS
AN
ESPECIALLY
EXTREME
CASE
BECAUSE
I
WAS
YOUNG
AND
AWAY
FROM
HOME
AND
FELLOWSHIP
I
DONT
THINK
IT
WOULD
WORK
EXACTLY
THIS
WAY
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
HOWEVER
ITS
IMPORTANT
NOT
TO
UNDERESTIMATE
THE
POWER
OF
FEELINGS
OF
ATTRACTION
