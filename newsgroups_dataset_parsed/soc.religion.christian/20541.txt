RE
WEIRDNESS
OF
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
WERE
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
WEIRD
YES
SO
WERE
THEIR
NONCHRISTIAN
CONTEMPORARIES
THE
MORE
FAMILIAR
YOU
ARE
WITH
LATE
REPUBLICAN
ROME
OR
THE
PRICIPATE
THE
WEIRDER
THOSE
PEOPLE
WILL
SEEM
FORGET
THE
CREATIVE
FILTERING
DONE
BY
RENAISSANCE
AND
EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY
HERO
WORSHIP
SO
ARE
MODERN
NONCHRISTIANS
AND
CHRISTIANS
YOU
ARE
PRETTY
WEIRD
YOURSELF
WITH
YOUR
RATHER
ACID
DISMISSAL
OF
LUTHER
AND
OF
PROTESTANTISM
AND
IN
APPARENTLY
BUYING
INTO
A
SIMPLISTIC
PROPAGANDA
MODEL
ABOUT
CATHOLICISM
NOT
BEING
FADDISH
SURE
ITS
SO
LARGE
THAT
GLOBAL
FADS
TAKE
LONGER
CYCLES
THAN
THEY
DO
IN
SMALLER
DENOMINATIONS
AND
LOCAL
ONES
ARE
NOT
USUALLY
VISIBLE
UNLESS
YOU
DO
A
LOT
OF
TRAVELING
TO
EXOTIC
LANDS
MAY
I
RECOM
MEND
AS
A
SALUTARY
ANTIDOTE
TO
THIS
NONSENSE
PHILIPPE
ARIES
BOOK
THE
HOUR
OF
OUR
DEATH
A
LONGITUDINAL
STUDY
OF
DEATH
CUSTOMS
IN
WESTERN
SPECIFICALLY
CATHOLIC
CHRISTENDOM
AND
IT
WONT
HELP
TO
ESCAPE
INTO
THE
OBSCURITY
OF
THE
FIRST
CHRISTIAN
CENTURY
PAUL
WAS
PRETTY
WEIRD
TOO
AS
WERE
PETER
AND
THE
OTHERS
IN
THE
APPARENTLY
QUITE
WEIRD
CIRCLE
AROUND
JESUS
WHAT
I
THINK
YOU
MIGHT
FIND
HELPFUL
IS
A
BIT
MORE
CHARITY
TRY
TO
UNDERSTAND
THESE
WEIRDOS
AND
NUTCASES
WITH
THE
SAME
RESPECT
AND
LOVE
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
OTHERS
TO
SHOW
YOUR
NOTIONS
WE
ARE
COMMANDED
TO
LOVE
ONE
ANOTHER
AFTER
ALL
AND
BROWNS
BOOK
IS
IN
FACT
A
HEROIC
ATTEMPT
TO
SEE
THE
GROUPINGS
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
AS
MOTIVATED
IN
LOVE
AND
THE
GOSPEL
AND
THEIR
SOCIAL
CONTEXTS
IF
ANYTHING
BROWN
IS
TOO
HEROIC
HERE
HE
MANAGES
TO
OVERSTRAIN
HIMSELF
AT
TIMES
I
DONT
SUGGEST
THAT
WE
FOLLOW
ANY
OF
THESE
OLD
CULT
PATHS
AND
IT
RAISES
HARD
QUESTIONS
FROM
THE
SKEPTIC
INSIDE
ME
THAT
SO
MUCH
OF
EARLY
CHRISTIANITY
WAS
LIKE
THE
WEIRD
CHRISTIAN
AND
NONCHRISTIAN
CULTS
WE
SEE
TODAY
TO
THAT
EXTENT
I
THINK
YOU
RAISE
A
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
AND
PERHAPS
YOUR
PHRASING
IS
IMPLICITLY
SELFDEPRECATORY
AND
IRONIC
BUT
THE
FIRST
PRINCIPLE
FOR
ANSWERING
THESE
QUESTIONS
IS
RESPECT
AND
LOVE
FOR
THOSE
WE
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
AND
IT
HELPS
TO
WORK
AT
UNDER
STANDING
AS
LONG
AS
WE
DO
NOT
GET
OVERWHELMED
BY
REVULSION
AND
BEGIN
TO
WITHDRAW
OUR
RESPECT
FOR
THEM
AS
PEOPLE
I
WOULD
ADVISE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
MORE
HISTORICAL
READING
BROWNS
OTHER
BOOKS
ARE
ALSO
GOOD
MOST
ESPECIALLY
HIS
BIO
OF
AUGUSTINE
ALSO
TRY

OF

WE
HAVE
KNOWN
ONE

PERSON
AND
WE
KILLED
HIM
FORTUNATELY
FOR
US
THIS
HAS
PROVED
A
COMEDY
RATHER
THAN
A
TRAGEDY
EASTER
YES
THIS
IS
A
TAD
EARLY
OUR
VIGIL
SERVICE
HERE
HAS
BEEN
MOVED
FORWARD
BECAUSE
SO
MANY
CHURCHES
IN
THE
AREA
HAVE
TAKEN
TO
DOING
THEIR
OWN
VIGILS
AND
THE
SEMINARIANS
MUST
THEREFORE
WORSHIPANDRUN
IF
THEY
ARE
TO
DO
IT
HERE
AND
THERE
AS
WELL
THINK
OF
THIS
