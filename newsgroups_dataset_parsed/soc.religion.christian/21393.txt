DIVORCE
I
DELETED
MUCH
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
ARTICLE
IN
ORDER
TO
DISCUSS
THE
SPECIFIC
ISSUE
OF
WHETHER
IT
IS
ACCEPTABLE
TO
DIVORCE
IN
ARTICLE
CRSCARSONUWASHINGTONEDU
CLIFF
SLAUGHTERBECK
WRITES
ALONG
THE
WAY
SHE
WAS
MARRIED
HAPPILY
TO
A
WONDERFUL
AND
SUPPORTIVE
HUSBAND
AND
GAVE
BIRTH
TO
TWO
SONS
STILL
EVERYTHING
WAS
NOT
PERFECT
FOR
JANE
SINCE
SHE
COULD
NEVER
OPEN
UP
THE
DEEPEST
PART
OF
HER
SOUL
TO
HER
HUSBAND
SHE
ALWAYS
FOUND
THAT
SHE
COULD
BE
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
HER
WOMEN
FRIENDS
THAN
TO
HER
HUSBAND
AS
GOOD
AND
LOING
AS
A
HUSBAND
AS
HE
MIGHT
BE
SHE
STRUGGLED
VERY
MUCH
WITH
THIS
UNTIL
AT
THE
AGE
OF
SHE
DECIDED
THAT
SHE
WAS
A
LESBIAN
WHEN
SHE
CAME
HOME
TO
ANNOUNCE
THIS
UNDERSTANDING
OF
HERSELF
HER
HUSBAND
TOLD
HER
THAT
HE
HAD
COME
TO
THE
SAME
UNDERSTANDING
SEVERAL
YEARS
BEFORE
AND
WAS
WAITING
FOR
HER
TO
COME
TO
THAT
REALIZATION
IN
HER
OWN
TIME
HER
CHILDREN
AGES
AND
AT
THE
TIME
WERE
ALSO
EXTREMELY
SUPPORTIVE
OF
HER
AS
THE
YOUNGEST
PUT
IT
THAT
JUST
MEANS
THAT
YOU
LOVE
PEOPLE
VERY
MUCH
JANE
AND
HER
HUSBAND
AGREED
TO
DIVORCE
BUT
REMAIN
FRIENDS
AND
STILL
CONSIDER
EACH
OTHER
AS
PART
OF
THE
EXTENDED
FAMILY
TO
THIS
DAY
ONE
OF
THE
INTERESTING
THINGS
THAT
JANE
SAID
IN
THIS
WHOLE
DISCUSSION
WAS
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
NOT
ABOUT
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
THE
BEDROOM
SHE
FOUND
THAT
SHE
WAS
MUCH
MORE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
A
DEEP
COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
A
WOMAN
THAN
A
MAN
SEX
IN
HER
MIND
IS
ONLY
A
PART
OF
THE
WHOLE
RELATIONSHIP
THE
KEY
THING
IS
HOW
ONE
INTERCONNECTS
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLE
SHE
MADE
A
SPECIFIC
POINT
TO
SAY
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
THAT
SHE
HAD
NEVER
MET
A
GOOD
MAN
SINCE
SHE
WAS
MARRIED
TO
A
WONDERFUL
MAN
FOR
A
DOZEN
YEARS
TAKE
A
FEW
SECONDS
AND
HONESTLY
PONDER
THAT
THOUGHT
AND
ITS
IMPLICATIONS
I
HAVE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
THE
IMPLICATIONS
AND
IT
IS
SCARY
WE
HAVE
A
WHOLE
GENERATION
OF
FAMILIES
BROKEN
UP
BECAUSE
SOME
MEN
HAVE
DECIDED
THAT
IS
IS
OKAY
TO
LEAVE
THEIR
WIVES
AND
CHILDREN
FOR
THE
THRILL
OF
A
YOUNGER
MORE
ATTRACTIVE
WOMAN
IF
WE
ACCEPT
THAT
IT
IS
LEGITIMATE
FOR
JANE
TO
HAVE
DIVORCED
HOW
CAN
WE
NOT
ACCEPT
ANYONES
DECISION
TO
DIVORCE
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
FOUND
SOMEONE
WITH
WHOM
HE
CAN
HAVE
A
MORE
DEEP
COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP
MARRIAGE
IS
NOT
A
STATE
OF
BEING
IT
IS
A
MUTUAL
JOURNEY
IN
LIFE
LOVE
IS
NOT
A
PASSIVE
FEELING
IT
MUST
BE
ACTIVELY
WILLED
IS
IT
ACCEPTABLE
FOR
AN
OLDER
EXECUTIVE
TO
DUMP
HIS
WIFE
OF
MANY
YEARS
WHO
STAYED
HOME
TO
CARE
FOR
THE
CHILDREN
BECAUSE
HE
CANT
BE
HAPPY
SEXUALLY
UNLESS
HE
IS
WITH
A
BEAUTIFUL
YOUNG
BLONDE
THE
REAL
SOLUTION
FOR
BOTH
IN
THE
COUPLE
TO
MAKE
A
RENEWED
EFFORT
HOLD
FAST
TO
THE
FAITH
HAS
NOT
THE
LORD
REPEATEDLY
COMPARED
HIS
RELATION
TO
HIS
PEOPLE
AS
A
FAITHFUL
AND
ENDURING
HUSBAND
WE
LEARN
SOMETHING
VERY
DEEP
AND
VERY
MYSTICAL
WHEN
WE
MARRY
AND
REMAIN
FAITHFUL
THROUGH
TIMES
OF
TRIAL
MY
SPOUSE
HAS
A
BRAIN
TUMOR
THAT
HAS
LEFT
HER
PARTIALLY
PARALYZED
IF
IT
WERE
TO
RESUME
GROWING
IT
IS
IN
REMISSION
THANKS
BE
TO
GOD
THEN
PERHAPS
THE
TIME
WOULD
COME
WHEN
WE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
SEXUAL
RELATIONS
THATS
LIFETHE
LORD
WOULD
CERTAINLY
NOT
GIVE
ME
PERMISSION
TO
SEEK
SOMEONE
ELSE
TO
SATISFY
MY
NEEDS
THE
IDEA
THAT
IT
IS
ALRIGHT
TO
DIVORCE
IF
A
COUPLE
GROWS
APART
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
LEAD
TO
SUCH
A
MONSTROUS
DESTRUCTION
OF
THE
MEANING
OF
MARRIAGE
THAT
I
FEEL
WE
MUST
MAKE
EVERY
EFFORT
TO
AVOID
ANY
HINT
OF
COMPROMISE
WE
HAVE
BECOME
SO
PETTY
AND
SMALLMINDED
THAT
SOME
HUSBANDS
ARE
THREATENING
TO
DIVORCE
THEIR
WIVES
UNLESS
THE
WIVES
LOSE
WEIGHT
I
PRAISE
THE
LORD
FOR
GUIDING
ME
TO
MARRY
MY
WIFE
SHE
MARRIED
ME
ANYWAY
DESPITE
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
I
COULD
HAVE
A
TERRIBLE
ILLNESS
AND
IT
TURNED
OUT
THAT
SHE
WAS
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
BRAIN
TUMOR
BUT
HAD
I
KNOWN
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
CARED
EITHER
AND
MAYBE
ILL
BE
IN
A
CAR
ACCIDENT
TOMORROW
AND
BECOME
PARALYZED
FROM
THE
NECK
DOWN
A
MARRIED
COUPLE
SHOULD
DEAL
WITH
THESE
SITUATIONS
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
THE
LORD
NOT
DIVORCE
AND
RUN
AWAY
FROM
THEM
