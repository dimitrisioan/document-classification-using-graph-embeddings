WILLIAM
HARGREAVES
WRITES
HI
EVERYONE
IM
A
COMMITED
CHRISTIAN
THAT
IS
BATTLING
WITH
A
PROBLEM
I
KNOW
THAT
ROMANS
TALKS
ABOUT
HOW
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
OUR
FAITH
NOT
OUR
DEEDS
YET
HEBREWS
AND
JAMES
SAY
THAT
FAITH
WITHOUT
DEEDS
IS
USELESS
SAYING
YOU
FOOLS
DO
YOU
STILL
THINK
THAT
JUST
BELIEVING
IS
ENOUGH
NOW
IF
SOMEONE
IS
FULLY
BELIEVING
BUT
THERE
LIFE
IS
TOTALLY
LEAD
BY
THEMSELVES
AND
NOT
BY
GOD
ACCORDING
TO
ROMANS
THAT
PERSON
IS
STILL
SAVED
BY
THERE
FAITH
MY
YES
AND
NO
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THE
ABOVE
SCENARIO
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
EITHER
THEY
ARE
BELIEVING
AND
LIVING
IN
AT
LEAST
SOME
PART
LED
BY
GOD
ELSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
BELIEVING
INTELLECTUALLY
BUT
WAITING
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
ESPECIALLY
IMPORTANT
TO
REMEMBER
IS
THAT
NO
ONE
CAN
JUDGE
WHETHER
YOU
ARE
SO
COMMITTED
NOR
CAN
YOU
JUDGE
SOMEONE
ELSE
I
GUESS
THE
CLOSEST
WE
CAN
COME
TO
KNOW
SOMEONES
SITUATION
IS
LISTENING
TO
THEIR
OWN
STATEMENTS
THIS
CAN
BE
FALLIBLE
AS
IS
OUR
SENSE
OF
COMMUNION
ONE
WITH
ANOTHER
BUT
THEN
THERE
IS
THE
BIT
WHICH
SAYS
THAT
GOD
PREFERES
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
COLD
TO
HIM
IE
DOESNT
KNOW
HIM
CONDEMNED
SO
A
LUKEWARM
CHRISTIAN
SOMEONE
WHO
KNOWS
AND
BELIEVES
IN
GOD
BUT
DOESN
T
MAKE
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
LIVE
BY
THE
BIBLE
REGARDING
THIS
PASSAGE
WE
NEED
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
THIS
IS
A
LETTER
TO
A
CHURCH
AT
LAODICEA
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
OF
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
THEIR
WORKS
A
TRANSLATION
COULD
SAY
THAT
HE
SAYS
THEIR
LACK
OF
CONCERN
MAKES
HIM
SICK
TO
THE
POINT
OF
THROWING
UP
NOW
I
AM
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
YOU
A
SAVED
THROUGH
FAITH
ALONE
NOT
WHAT
YOU
DO
AS
TAUGHT
IN
ROMANS
BUT
HOW
CAN
I
SQUARE
UP
IN
MY
MIND
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
JAMES
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
THE
LUKEWARM
CHRISTIAN
BEING
SPATOUT
RIGHT
SAVING
IS
BY
FAITH
ALONE
EXCEPT
THAT
FAITH
DOES
NOT
COME
ALONE
IF
YOU
CATCH
THE
TWO
MEANINGS
I
CAN
OFFER
THE
EXPLANATION
THAT
JESUS
WOULD
THAT
WE
WERE
EITHER
ON
FIRE
FOR
HIM
OR
SO
COLD
WE
KNEW
WE
WERE
NOT
IN
HIS
WILL
AND
THUS
COULD
BE
MADE
AWARE
OF
OUR
SEPARATION
THIS
IS
ADMONISHMENT
FOR
HIS
CHILDREN
NOT
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
ANSWER
NOT
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
THOU
ALSO
BE
LIKE
UNTO
HIM
ANSWER
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
HE
BE
WISE
IN
HIS
OWN
CONCEIT
PROVERBS
