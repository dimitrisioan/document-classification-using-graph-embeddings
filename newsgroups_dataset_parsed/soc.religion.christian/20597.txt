RE
PRAYER
IN
JESUS
NAME
ACCORDING
TO
WHAT
I
HAVE
READ
ON
BIBLICAL
IDIOMS
SPEAKING
IN
XS
NAME
IS
A
STANDARD
ARAMAICHEBREW
LEGAL
IDIOM
FOR
WHAT
WE
TODAY
WOULD
CALL
POWER
OF
ATTORNEY
A
PERSON
FROM
JESUS
CULTURE
AUTHORIZED
TO
CONDUCT
BUSINESS
IN
JOHNS
NAME
HAD
FULL
AUTHORITY
OVER
JOHNS
FINANCIAL
AFFAIRS
BUT
WAS
HELD
UNDER
A
SOLEMN
FIDUCIARY
OBLIGATION
TO
WORK
ONLY
FOR
JOHNS
BENEFIT
AND
CONSONANT
WITH
JOHNS
WISHES
IT
WAS
NOT
REQUIRED
FOR
THE
STEWARD
TO
PREFACE
EACH
BUSINESS
TRANSACTION
WITH
IN
JOHNS
NAME
IT
WAS
SUFFICIENT
TO
HAVE
VALID
POWER
OF
ATTORNEY
AND
BE
OPERATING
IN
GOOD
FAITH
NOTE
THE
OVERLAP
HERE
BETWEEN
LEGAL
AND
RELIGIOUS
DEFINITIONS
OF
FAITH
WITH
THIS
CULTURAL
BACKGROUND
PRAYING
IN
JESUS
NAME
DOES
NOT
MANDATE
A
PARTICULAR
VERBAL
FORMULA
RATHER
IT
REQUIRES
THAT
THE
PETITIONER
BE
OPERATING
FAITHFULLY
AND
CONSCIOUSLY
WITHIN
AN
ANALOGOUS
FIDUCIARY
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
JESUS
AND
FOR
THE
PURPOSES
OF
HIS
KINGDOM
THE
MESSAGE
OF
PRAYING
IN
JESUS
NAME
IS
THUS
CLOSELY
ALIGNED
WITH
THE
PARABLE
OF
THE
TALENTS
AND
OTHER
PASSAGES
ABOUT
GODS
DELEGATION
OF
KINGDOM
BUSINESS
TO
HIS
STEWARDS
BOTH
RESOURCES
AND
RESPONSIBILITIES
THIS
IDEA
OF
PRAYING
IN
JESUS
NAME
IS
NOT
ONLY
PRESENT
BUT
PROMINENT
IN
THE
LORDS
PRAYER
ALTHOUGH
THE
VERBAL
FORUMULA
IS
ABSENT
THE
ACT
OF
PRAYING
THE
WORDS
IN
JESUS
NAME
MAY
BE
BENEFICIAL
IF
THEY
CAUSE
US
TO
CLARIFY
THE
RELATIONSHIP
OF
OUR
REQUESTS
TO
THE
ADVANCEMENT
OF
GODS
KINGDOM
FOR
THAT
REASON
IM
NOT
QUITE
READY
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
PRAYING
THE
FORMULA
IS
WITHOUT
MEANING
PRAYERS
TO
GOD
FOR
OTHER
PURPOSES
DESPERATION
ANGER
THANKSGIVING

FOR
YOU
PC
I
DONT
SEE
ANYTHING
IN
CHRISTS

TO
CONTRADICT
THE
