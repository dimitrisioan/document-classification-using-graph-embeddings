QUOTED
A
LETTER
FROM
JAMES
M
STOWELL
PRESIDENT
OF
MOODY
BIBLE
INSTITUTE
WE
AFFIRM
THE
ABSOLUTES
OF
SCRIPTURE
NOT
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
ARROGANT
MORALISTS
BUT
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
WHO
IS
TRUTH
WHO
HAS
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTH
IN
HIS
WORD
AND
THEREFORE
WE
HOLD
AS
PRECIOUS
THE
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
OF
THOSE
ABSOLUTES
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
LOT
OF
DISCUSSION
BUT
SO
FAR
NOBODY
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
HIT
ON
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
CRITICISM
OF
ARROGANCE
IS
AIMED
AT
LOTS
OF
STUFF
DELETED
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
ARISES
MANY
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
THEIR
OWN
PERSONAL
RESEARCH
CAN
GIVE
THEM
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
ABOUT
THE
DOCTRINES
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THEY
ARE
IMPLICITLY
CLAIMING
THAT
THEY
ARE
INFALLIBLE
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
POSSIBILITY
OF
MISTAKE
CLAIMING
THAT
YOU
CANNOT
HAVE
MADE
A
MISTAKE
AND
THAT
YOUR
THINKING
HAS
LED
YOU
TO
A
FLAWLESS
CONCLUSION
IS
PRETTY
ARROGANT
I
AGREE
WITH
WHAT
DARREN
HAS
TO
SAY
HERE
BUT
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ADD
A
PERSONAL
OBSERVATION
WHAT
I
SEE
AS
ARROGANCE
AND
THE
PROBLEM
I
HAVE
WITH
IT
IS
NOT
A
SENSE
OF
PERSONAL
CERTAINTY
BUT
A
LACK
OF
RESPECT
FOR
OTHERS
WHO
COME
TO
DIFFERING
CONCLUSIONS
CLEARLY
THIS
IS
NOT
JUST
CHRISTIAN
VS
NONCHRISTIAN
THERE
IS
A
WHOLE
SPECTRUM
OF
BELIEF
SYSTEMS
WITHIN
CHRISTIANITY
I
DO
NOT
TEND
TO
ARGUE
WITH
OTHERS
ABOUT
MATTERS
OF
PERSONAL
FAITH
BECAUSE
LIKE
AESTHETICS
IT
IS
NOT
DEMONSTABLE
BY
OBJECTIVE
MEANS
CHOOSING
WHAT
TO
BELIEVE
AND
RELY
ON
ARE
IMPORTANT
AREAS
OF
PERSONAL
SOVEREIGNTY
WHAT
BOTHERS
ME
IS
WHEN
OTHERS
SUGGEST
THAT
IN
THESE
MATTERS
OF
FAITH
THEIR
SPECIFIC
BELIEFS
ARE
NOT
ONLY
TRUE
TO
THEM
BUT
ARE
ABSOLUTE
AND
SHOULD
BE
BINDING
ON
OTHERS
IT
FOLLOWS
FROM
THIS
THAT
GOD
MUST
GIVE
EVERYONE
THE
SAME
REVELATION
OF
TRUTH
AND
THUS
ANYONE
WHO
COMES
TO
A
DIFFERENT
CONCLUSION
IS
INTENTIONALLY
CHOOSING
THE
WRONG
PATH
THIS
IS
THE
ARROGANCE
I
SEE
A
LACK
OF
RESPECT
FOR
THE
HONEST
CONCLUSIONS
OF
OTHERS
ON
MATTERS
WHICH
ARE
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
GOD
EVEN
A
PERSONAL
CERTAINTY
LEAVES
ROOM
FOR
THE
BELIEFS
OF
OTHERS
IT
IS
UNIVERSALIZING
THOSE
MATTERS
OF
PERSONAL
FAITH
COUPLED
BY
A
PROUD
NOTION
THAT
ONES
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
IS
SUPERIOR
TO
OTHERS
THAT
LEADS
TO
ARROGANCE
IN
MY
HONEST
AND
NONUNIVERSAL

CRITICISM
WELCOME
KEN
ALVINUCSUCOLORADOEDU
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
REASONABLE
TO
ASK
FOR
SOME
HUMILITY
ABOUT
OUR
OWN
ABILITY
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
THERE
ARE
ALSO
DIFFERENT
PATHS
IN
SOME
AREAS
OF
PRACTICE
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
MORE
CLARIFICATION
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
WHEN
YOU
REJECT
THE
IDEA
OF
SAYING
THEIR
SPECIFIC
BELIEFS
ARE
NOT
ONLY
TRUE
TO
THEM
BUT
ARE
ABSOLUTE
AND
SHOULD
BE
BINDING
ON
OTHERS
IF
SOMETHING
IS
TRUE
IT
IS
TRUE
FOR
EVERYONE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
BELIEF
IS
SOMETHING
ABOUT
GOD
HISTORY
ETC
OF
COURSE
SOMETHING
OF
THE
FORM
I
BELIEVE
THAT
ITS
BEST
FOR
ME
NOT
TO
XXX
COULD
BE
TRUE
FOR
SOME
PEOPLE
AND
NOT
OTHERS
I
HAVE
SUGGESTED
IN
THE
PAST
THAT
GOD
MAY
BE
LESS
CONCERNED
ABOUT
DOCTRINAL
AGREEMENT
THAN
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
I
DOUBT
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
TRUE
AND
FALSE
NOR
THAT
I
THINK
THERE
IS
NO
BENEFIT
IN
FINDING
OUT
WHAT
IS
TRUE
