ANDREW
MCVEIGH
WRITES
THE
BIBLES
MESSAGE
IS
THAT
WE
ARE
TO
LOVE
ALL
PEOPLE
AND
THAT
ALL
PEOPLE
ARE
REDEEMABLE
IT
PREACHES
A
MESSAGE
OF
REPENTANCE
AND
OF
GIVING
UNFORTUNATELY
ALL
PEOPLE
HAVE
DECEITFUL
HEARTS
AND
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
TURNING
THIS
MESSAGE
AROUND
AND
CONTORTING
IT
IN
SOMETIMES
UNBELIEVABLE
WAYS
THIS
IS
ALSO
A
FUNDAMENTAL
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
ANDREW
HOW
I
WISH
THIS
WERE
TRUE
AND
HOW
I
LONG
FOR
THE
DAY
IN
WHICH
IT
WILL
BE
TRUE
BUT
ALAS
IT
IS
NOT
TRUE
OF
HISTORY
THE
BIBLE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
MESSAGE
IT
HAS
MESSAGES
AND
SOME
OF
THOSE
ARE
MESSAGES
OF
REPENTANCE
AND
GIVING
TO
TURN
THE
OTHER
CHEEK
AND
DO
UNTO
THE
LEAST
OF
THESE
BUT
SOME
OF
THE
MESSAGES
ARE
THE
COMPLETE
OPPOSITE
LIKE
THE
ISREALITES
ORDER
TO
WIPE
OUT
OTHER
TRIBES
INCLUDING
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
DOWN
TO
CATTLE
AND
PUNISHED
SEVERELY
WHEN
THEY
WERE
LESS
THAN
COMPLETE
ABOUT
THE
JOB
LIKE
JEWS
WHO
ARE
SAID
TO
HAVE
CRIED
OUT
IN
MATTHEW
HIS
BLOOD
BE
UPON
OUR
HEADS
AND
OUR
CHILDRENS
HEADS
A
VERSE
QUOTED
IN
EVERY
POGROM
FROM
THE
CRUSADES
TO
THE
HOLOCAUST
HAVE
THESE
BEEN
MISUNDERSTOOD
I
THINK
NOT
THEY
HAVE
ONLY
BEEN
UNDERSTOOD
TOO
CLEARLY
IT
IS
ESSENTIAL
THAT
CHRISTIANS
GRASP
FIRMLY
THE
GOOD
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THE
MEEK
CARPENTER
FROM
NAZARETH
IS
A
POTENT
SYMBOL
FOR
HOW
WE
SHOULD
BE
HIS
TEACHINGS
WE
MUST
TAKE
TO
HEART
BUT
WE
CANNOT
IGNORE
THE
OTHER
MATERIAL
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
IS
NOT
TO
OUR
LIKING
AND
SAY
THOSE
WHO
LIVE
BY
THAT
HAVE
MISREAD
IT
TO
SAY
THAT
IS
ONLY
TO
CHOSE
A
POINT
OF
INTERPRETATION
AND
DECLARE
IT
NORMATIVE
SUCH
CAN
BE
DONE
WITH
THE
SAME
LEGITMACY
BY
ANYONE
INSTEAD
WE
MUST
LET
THE
TEXT
CRITIQUE
THE
TEXT
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THERE
IS
BOTH
GOOD
AND
BAD
IN
OUR
SACRED
CORPUS
WE
TEST
ALL
THINGS
AND
HOLD
FAST
TO
THAT
WHICH
IS
GOOD
PS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
A
LINE
OF
QUESTIONING
LIKE
YOU
PRESENTED
IS
STRANGELY
ENOUGH
COMPATIBLE
WITH
BECOMING
A
CHRISTIAN
CERTAINLY
CHRISTIANITY
ENCOURAGES
ONE
TO
QUESTION
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
ESPECIALLY
CHRISTIANS
I
PRAISE
GOD
FOR
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
CAN
DOUBT
OUR
BELIEFS
AND
STILL
COME
BACK
TO
GOD
AND
BE
FORGIVEN
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
AT
THE
RISK
OF
SOUNDING
HERETICAL
WELL
OK
MORE
HERETICAL
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
DOUBT
IS
SOMETHING
WHICH
REQUIRES
FORGIVENESS
IT
IS
SOMETHING
WHICH
REQUIRES
INTROSPECTION
AND
REFLECTION
IF
THAT
IS
A
SIN
THEN
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
SALVATION
FOR
DOUBT
IS
AN
INESCAPBLE
PART
OF
BEING
HUMAN
CONSIDER
JOB
HIS
FRIENDS
HAD
NO
DOUBT
WHEREAS
JOB
HAD
NO
DOUBT
IN
HIMSELF
BUT
DOUBTED
THE
WISDOM
AND
JUSTICE
OF
GOD
WHEN
GOD
FINALLY
DID
APPEAR
HE
REBUKED
THE
FRIENDS
AND
HAD
JOB
MAKE
SACRIFICES
FOR
THEM
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
IT
TO
ALWAYS
HAVE
DOUBT
OR
NOT
TO
HAVE
HONESTY
