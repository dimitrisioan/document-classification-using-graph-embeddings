RE
DID
HE
REALLY
RISE
IN
ARTICLE
PARKINENGSUNCOM
MICHAEL
PARKIN
WRITES
ANOTHER
ISSUE
OF
IMPORTANCE
WAS
THE
CRUCIFICATION
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
OR
A
TRAGIC
MISTAKE
I
BELIEVE
IT
WAS
A
TRAGIC
MISTAKE
GODS
WILL
CAN
NEVER
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
THROUGH
THE
DISBELIEF
OF
MAN
I
FINISHED
READING
A
VERY
GOOD
BOOK
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
WEATHERHEAD
THIS
WAS
VERY
HELPFUL
TO
ME
IN
APPLYING
THOUGHT
TO
THE
SUBJECT
OF
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
WEATHERHEAD
BROKE
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
INTO
THREE
DISTINCT
PARTS
INTENTIONAL
WILL
CIRCUMSTANCIAL
WILL
AND
ULTIMATE
WILL
HE
WEATHERHEAD
ALSO
REFUTED
THE
LAST
STATEMENT
ABOVE
BY
MICHAEL
PARKIN
ABOVE
QUITE
NICELY
SUMMARIZING
DESPITE
THE
FAILURES
OF
HUMANKIND
GODS
ULTIMATE
WILL
IS
NEVER
TO
BE
DEFEATED
GODS
INTENTIONS
MAY
BE
INTERFERED
WITH
EVEN
TEMPORARILY
DEFEATED
BY
THE
WILL
OF
HUMANKIND
BROUGHT
DOWN
BY
CIRCUMSTANCE
HIS
ULTIMATE
WILL
THE
RECONCILICATION
OF
ALL
HUMANKIND
WILL
NEVER
BE
STOPPED
TIME
AFTER
TIME
WEATHERHEAD
USED
THE
CROSS
AS
THE
BEST
DESCRIPTION
OF
THIS
PROCESS
AT
WORK
HIS
POINTS
PARAPHRASED
WERE
GODS
INTENTIONAL
WILL
WAS
FOR
JESUS
THE
CHRIST
TO
LIVE
OUT
A
FULL
LIFE
AND
PERFORM
THE
WORK
OF
THE
LIVING
GOD
THE
FAILURES
SINS
AND
DEVIOUSNESS
OF
HUMANKIND
FRUSTRATED
GODS
INTENT
FOR
HIS
SON
DESPITE
THE
CIRCUMSTANCE
GODS
ULTIMATE
WILL
WAS
REVEALED
IN
THE
CROSS
AS
JESUS
WILLINGLY
NOT
MY
WILL
LORD
BUT
YOURS
DIED
FOR
THE
REDEMPTION
OF
ALL
HUMANKIND
THE
CROSS
WAS
UTTERLY
TRIUMPHANT
OVERCOMING
EVEN
THE
MOST
CRUEL
OF
CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS
WORLD
TO
BUILD
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
ON
THE
EARTH
HE
DESPERATELY
WANTED
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
TO
ACCEPT
HIM
AS
THE
MESSIAH
IF
THE
CRUCIFICATION
WAS
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
HOW
COULD
JESUS
PRAY
THAT
THIS
CUP
PASS
FROM
HIM
WAS
THIS
OUT
OF
WEAKNESS
NEVER
MANY
MEN
AND
WOMEN
HAVE
GIVEN
THEIR
LIVES
FOR
THEIR
COUNTRY
OR
OTHER
NOBLE
CAUSES
IS
JESUS
LESS
THAN
THESE
NO
HE
IS
NOT
HE
KNEW
THE
CRUCIFICATION
WAS
NOT
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
INTENTIONAL
WILL
OF
GOD
IT
WAS
THE
CIRCUMSTANCIAL
WILL
THUS
ENABLING
THE
VICTORY
OF
THE
ULTIMATE
WILL
GODS
WILL
WAS
THAT
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
ACCEPT
JESUS
AS
THE
MESSIAH
AND
THAT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
BE
ESTABLISHED
ON
THE
EARTH
WITH
JESUS
AS
ITS
HEAD
RIGHT
INTENTIONAL
WILL
JUST
LIKE
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
EXPECTED
IF
THIS
HAD
HAPPENED
YEARS
AGO
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
WHAT
KIND
OF
WORLD
WE
WOULD
LIVE
IN
TODAY
IT
WOULD
BE
A
VERY
DIFFERENT
WORLD
AND
THAT
IS
EACTLY
WHAT
GOD
WANTED
MEN
AND
WOMEN
OF
THAT
AGE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
SAVED
BY
FOLLOWING
THE
LIVING
MESSIAH
WHILE
HE
WAS
ON
THE
EARTH
JESUS
COULD
HAVE
ESTABLISHED
A
SINLESS
LINEAGE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
CONTINUED
HIS
REIGN
AFTER
HIS
ASCENSION
TO
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
TO
LIVE
WITH
GOD
NOW
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
ON
THE
EARTH
WILL
HAVE
TO
WAIT
FOR
CHRISTS
RETURN
BUT
WHEN
HE
RETURNS
WILL
HE
BE
RECOGNIZED
AND
WILL
HE
FIND
FAITH
ON
THIS
EARTH
ISNT
IT
ABOUT
TIME
FOR
HIS
RETURN
ITS
BEEN
ALMOST
YEARS
WE
KNOW
NEITHER
THE
TIME
NOR
THE
PLACE
HE
WILL
RETURN
AS
A
THIEF
IN
THE
NIGHT
