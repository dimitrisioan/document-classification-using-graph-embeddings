I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
VIEWS
ABOUT
THE
NONEVENT
OF
MAY
SERIOUSLY
HOW
CAN
A
CHRISTIAN
DISCRIMINATE
BETWEEN
MESSAGES
FROM
GOD
WHICH
ARE
TO
BE
TAKEN
SERIOUSLY
AND
THOSE
WHICH
ARE
SPURIOUS
IS
THERE
A
USEFUL
HEURISTIC
WHICH
WOULD
HELP
US
AVOID
EMBRACING
MESSAGES
WHICH
BY
THEIR
NONFULFILLMENT
ARE
PROVEN
TO
BE
FALSE
THUS
CAUSING
THE
NAME
OF
CHRIST
TO
BE
PLACED
IN
DISREPUTE
IS
THIS
A
PROBLEM
AT
ALL
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
INDIVIDUAL
SAW
A
TRUE
PROPHETIC
VISION
BUT
THAT
HE
INTERPRETED
THE
SCALE
OF
TIME
AND
SPACE
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
MATERIAL
CON
SCIOUSNESS
TRANSLATING
THE
SUPERSENSIBLE
PERCEPTIONS
OF
A
PLANE
ABOVE
THAT
OF
TIME
AND
SPACE
INTO
AN
IMMEDIATE
WORLDLY
CONTEXT
AND
GETTING
IT
WRONG
NOT
THAT
HE
DID
IT
RATIONALLY
BUT
RATHER
THAT
UNCONSCIOUSLY
THE
PERCEPTIONS
BECAME
CLOTHED
IN
MATERIAL
IMAGES
INSTEAD
OF
REMAINING
IN
THE
REALM
OF
THE
POTENTIAL
AND
NOTYETTIMESPACEBOUND
THIS
DIFFICULTY
OF
TRANSLATING
PROPHETIC
VISION
INTO
A
CONCRETE
WHEN
AND
WHERE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
DIFFICULT
EVEN
FOR
THE
PROPHETS
OF
OLD
THAT
IS
WHY
THEIR
PROPHECIES
ARE
SO
OFTEN
SUBJECT
TO
MULTIPLE
INTERPRETATIONS
LIKEWISE
THE
APOSTLES
SEEMED
TO
FEEL
THAT
THE
RETURN
OF
THE
LORD
WAS
TO
BE
VERY
SOON
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
PERHAPS
THE
SAME
GENERATION
YET
THE
MEANING
OF
VERY
SOON
HAS
PROVEN
TO
BE
DIFFERENT
THAN
THEY
COULD
GRASP
PROPHETIC
VISION
TENDS
TO
TELESCOPE
TIME
SO
THAT
THINGS
THAT
ARE
FAR
OFF
APPEAR
TO
BE
VERY
CLOSE
ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY
IS
THAT
THE
VISION
WAS
ONE
OF
A
REAL
EVENT
PREPARING
TO
HAPPEN
AGAIN
IN
THE
REALM
OF
THE
POTENTIALBUTNOTYETMANIFEST
AND
WHICH
WAS
THWARTED
BY
OTHER
FORCES
INCLUDING
POSSIBLY
AN
ACT
OF
DIVINE
MERCY
THERE
ARE
MANY
CONCRETE
PROPHECIES
BEING
MADE
THESE
DAYS
BY
DEVOUT
AND
SINCERE
AND
SOBER
CHRISTIANS
AND
OTHERS
TOO
IT
SEEMS
THAT
GREAT
COMING
EVENTS
ARE
REALLY
CASTING
THEIR
SHADOW
BEFORE
THEIR
ARRIVAL
IN
THESE
APOCALYPTIC
TIMES
THE
VARIOUS
PREDICTIONS
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
THOSE
THAT
APPEAR
TO
BE
SINCERE
AND
SOBER
ARE
HARD
TO
ACCEPT
YET
HARD
TO
IGNORE
COM
PLETELY
ONE
HAS
THE
FEELING
SOMETHING
IS
ABOUT
TO
START
TO
GET
READY
TO
BEGIN
TO
COMMENCE
TO
HAPPEN
WE
ARE
LIVING
AS
THE
CHINESE
SAYING
GOES
IN
INTERESTING
TIMES
AS
FOR
HOW
TO
DISCRIMINATE
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
HELP
MUCH
THERE
IS
AN
OLD
TESTAMENT
PASSAGE
I
FORGET
WHERE
IT
IS
THAT
SAYS
YOU
WILL
KNOW
WHETHER
A
PROPHET
IS
TRUE
BY
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HIS
PROPHECY
COMES
TO
PASS
THAT
HELPS
ELIMINATE
THE
FAILURES
AFTER
THE
FACT
BUT
IN
THE
CASE
OF
AN
EARTH
QUAKE
IT
IS
SMALL
COMFORT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ALL
PROPHECIES
THAT
GIVE
SPECIFIC
TIMES
AND
PLACES
AND
EVENTS
SHOULD
BE
SUSPECT
NOT
IN
THAT
THEY
ARE
NECESSARILY
FALSE
BUT
IN
THE
SENSE
STATED
ABOVE
THAT
ALL
SUCH
VISIONS
ARE
SUBJECT
TO
MISTRANSLATION
FROM
THE
PLANE
OF
PROPHETIC
VISION
TO
THE
PLANE
OF
EARTHLY
TIME
AND
SPACE
FOR
WHAT
IT
IS
WORTH
RUDOLF
STEINER
ONCE
WAS
ASKED
WHETHER
A
MODERN
INITIATE
COULD
SEE
INTO
THE
FUTURE
AND
PREDICT
COMING
EVENTS
HIS
ANSWER
WAS
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
BUT
THEN
HE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
WITHDRAW
FROM
ACTIVE
PARTI
CIPATION
IN
THEM
INCLUDING
PROCLAIMING
WHAT
HE
SAW
IF
THIS
IS
IN
FACT
A
SPIRITUAL
LAW
THEN
THE
ANSWER
TO
YOUR
QUESTION
ABOUT
HOW
TO
DISCRIMINATE
IS
THAT
THE
ONE
WHO
MAKES
SUCH
PROPHECIES
IS
PROBABLY
VIOLATING
THAT
LAW
KNOWINGLY
OR
UNKNOWINGLY
AND
AS
SUCH
HIS
MESSAGE
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
A
PRIORI
TO
BE
DUBIOUS
IE
I
WOULD
EXPECT
THAT
THOSE
CAPABLE
OF
MAKING
TRUE
PREDICTIONS
AND
GIVING
ACCURATE
EXPRESSION
TO
THEM
WOULD
NOT
DO
SO
IN
THE
WAY
THAT
THE
PROPHET
OF
THE
OREGON
EARTHQUAKE
DID
HOWEVER
I
CAN
SYMPATHIZE
WITH
THE
PERSON
WHO
PUBLISHED
THE
PROPHECY
GIVEN
THE
SAME
OVERWHELMING
EXPERIENCE
THAT
HE
APPARENTLY
HAD
I
TOO
MIGHT
FEEL
IMPELLED
AND
EVEN
COMMISSIONED
BY
GOD
TO
TELL
MY
FELLOW
HUMAN
BEINGS
ABOUT
WHAT
I
HAD
SEEN
GERRY
PALO
DO
ANY
OF
OUR
CHURCH
HISTORIAN
READERS
KNOW
WHETHER
THERES
ANY
MORE
PROPHECY
NOW
THAN
THERE
HAS
BEEN
IN
THE
PAST
I
DONT
GET
THAT
IMPRESSION
