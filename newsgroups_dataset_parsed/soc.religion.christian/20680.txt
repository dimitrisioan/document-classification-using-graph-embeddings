DOING
THE
WORK
OF
GOD
AS
OUR
LOCALRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
BBS
GROUP
SEEMS
MORIBUND
IM
POSTING
HERE
ON
ONE
OF
THE
SUNDAYS
JUST
BEFORE
EASTER
I
WENT
TO
CHURCH
THE
SERMON
WAS
BASED
ON
A
STORY
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
JOSHUA
THE
ONE
ABOUT
JOSHUA
SENDING
OUT
SPIES
TO
THE
LAND
HE
WAS
PLANNING
TO
TAKE
WHAT
I
PARTICULARLY
REMEMBER
BECAUSE
OF
HAVING
HEARD
PART
OF
A
CBC
RADIO
DOCUMENTARY
ON
BOSNIA
WAS
THAT
THE
RAHAB
THE
WOMAN
WHO
SHELTERED
THE
SPIES
SAID
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
MELTING
IN
FEAR
WHAT
WITH
HAVING
HEARD
THAT
CBC
RADIO
DOCUMENTARY
AND
KNOWING
THAT
THE
MUSLIMS
IN
BOSNIA
WERE
LOSING
THE
WAR
I
FELT
UNCOMFORTABLE
AFTER
ALL
THE
SERBS
ARE
DRIVING
NONCHRISTIANS
OUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MINISTERS
DO
SAY
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
VALUES
HELD
BY
OUR
SECULAR
SOCIETY
ANYHOW
MEMBERS
OF
THAT
CHURCH
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
OUTOFCOUNTRY
MISSIONARY
WORK
ALSO
THE
PASTOR
HAS
TALKED
OF
SPIRITUAL
WARFARE
AND
OF
BRINGING
CHRIST
TO
THE
NONRELIGIOUS
PEOPLE
OF
OUR
AREA
THE
NEXT
SUNDAY
THE
SERMON
WAS
ABOUT
JOSHUA
WHERE
THE
ISRAELITES
TAKE
JERICHO
AND
THEN
PROCEED
TO
MASSACRE
EVERYBODY
THERE
EXCEPT
FOR
RAHAB
WHO
HAD
SHELTERED
THE
SPIES
WITH
THOSE
REPORTS
ABOUT
BOSNIA
IN
MY
MIND
I
FELT
UNCOMFORTABLE
ABOUT
THE
MINISTER
SAYING
THAT
THE
MASSACRE
THE
ONE
IN
JOSHUA
WAS
RIGHT
BUT
WHAT
REALLY
BOTHERED
ME
WAS
THAT
IF
I
WAS
GOING
TO
TRY
TAKING
CHRISTIANITY
SERIOUSLY
I
SHOULDNT
BE
SO
TROUBLED
ABOUT
THE
REPORTS
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
IN
BOSNIA
CERTAINLY
MY
SYMPATHIES
SHOULDNT
BE
WITH
THE
MOSLIMS
CONSIDERING
THAT
THE
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
ARE
DESCENDANTS
OF
CHRISTIANS
WHO
UNDER
TURKISH
RULE
CONVERTED
TO
ISLAM
COULD
THE
SERBS
BE
DOING
GODS
WORK
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
GODS
PEOPLE
SETTING
OUT
ON
BLOODY
WARS
OF
CONQUEST
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
TROUBLING
IN
DISCUSSIONS
HERE
I
PERSONALLY
QUESTION
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
RIGHT
EVEN
AT
THE
TIME
BUT
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
THEY
WERE
CONSIDER
THAT
THE
WARS
WERE
JUSTIFIED
ONLY
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
SPECIFICALLY
COMMANDED
BY
GOD
SOMEHOW
I
DONT
SEE
THE
SERBS
BEHAVING
LIKE
A
GROUP
THAT
IS
LED
BY
GOD
IN
THIS
MATTER
