firstly
i
am
an
atheist
i
am
not
posting
here
as
an
immature
flame
start
but
rather
to
express
an
opinion
to
my
intended
audience
deleted
we
are
just
animals
we
need
sleep
food
and
we
reproduce
and
we
die
i
am
glad
that
i
am
not
an
atheist
it
seems
tragic
that
some
people
choose
a
meaningless
existence
how
terrible
to
go
on
living
only
because
one
fears
death
more
than
life
huh
okay
so
im
not
eric
molas
but
even
if
that
is
how
he
feels
about
life
i
disagree
with
it
life
to
me
is
definitely
not
meaningless
it
has
precisely
the
purpose
and
meaning
i
choose
to
give
it
i
go
on
living
because
i
like
living
if
i
needed
any
further
reason
id
be
free
completely
free
to
pick
any
reason
that
suited
me
that
freedom
can
be
almost
intoxicating
its
probably
the
closest
ive
ever
been
to
a
religious
experience
im
very
glad
i
am
an
atheist
i
wouldnt
be
anything
else
i
feel
so
sorry
for
eric
and
yet
any
attempts
to
share
my
joy
in
life
with
him
would
be
considered
as
further
evidence
of
the
infectious
nature
of
christianity
not
unless
in
explaining
your
own
subjective
experience
you
also
try
to
convert
him
or
proselytize
merely
explaining
the
effects
you
personally
experience
religion
as
having
on
you
is
not
infectious
not
unless
eric
is
paranoid
that
is
as
a
christian
i
am
free
to
be
a
human
person
i
think
love
choose
and
create
i
will
live
forever
with
god
whatever
floats
your
goat
you
sound
happy
enough
thats
fairly
much
all
that
matters
right
christ
is
not
a
kind
of
drug
drugs
are
a
replacement
for
christ
erh
pardon
but
it
strikes
me
that
sentence
sounds
reversible
those
who
have
an
empty
spot
in
the
godshaped
hole
in
their
hearts
must
do
something
to
ease
the
pain
empty
spot
godshaped
hole
i
hear
such
things
a
lot
from
theists
never
quite
did
understand
what
they
were
talking
about
i
have
no
such
emptiness
or
hole
maybe
some
others
do
i
wouldnt
know
but
i
dont
and
if
i
did
id
seek
help
about
it
doesnt
sound
like
a
mentally
healthy
situation
at
all
walking
around
with
a
hole
in
oneself
thank
you
eric
for
your
post
it
has
helped
me
to
appreciate
how
much
god
has
blessed
me
i
hope
that
you
will
someday
have
a
more
joyfilled
and
abundant
life
well
not
having
written
that
original
post
i
dont
know
if
it
was
intended
to
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
but
having
reread
it
carefully
i
somewhat
doubt
it
at
least
thats
not
how
he
gets
across
to
me
your
mileage
may
vary
disclaimer
its
great
to
be
young
and
insane
