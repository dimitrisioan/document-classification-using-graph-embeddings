WRITES
I
AM
FAIRLY
NEW
TO
THIS
GROUP
I
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
PEOPLES
OPINIONS
ON
ETHICAL
USES
OF
THE
NET
AND
OF
TECHNOLOGY
IN
GENERAL
THE
CLASSIC
REFERENCES
IN
THIS
AREA
ARE
JACQUES
ELLUL
FOR
A
LIBERALEVANGELICAL
PERSPECTIVE
AND
OS
GUINESS
FOR
A
STRAIGHT
EVANGELICAL
VIEW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
LOOK
AT
NONCHRISTIAN
SOURCES
TRY
ALVIN
TOFFLER
AS
THE
PERENNIAL
OPTIMIST
HIS
VIEWS
WHILE
BLATENTLY
NON
CHRISTIAN
EXPLORE
WHERE
TECHNOLOGY
MAY
BE
GOING
FOR
EXAMPLE
THERE
ARE
SOME
CHAIN
LETTERS
GOING
AROUND
WHICH
CLAIM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
WRITTEN
BY
A
CHRISTIAN
MISSIONARY
BUT
WHICH
PRESENT
A
MISLEADING
IMAGE
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
RELIGION
THIS
IS
REGARDLESS
OF
TECHNOLOGY
BE
CAREFUL
TO
SEPARATE
THE
ISSUES
OF
RELATED
TO
SPEED
AND
DISPERSION
OF
TECHNOLOGY
HOW
FAR
THE
LETTER
WENT
AND
HOW
QUICKLY
IT
GOT
THERE
AND
THE
MESSAGE
BEING
PASSED
IN
THE
TECHNOLOGY
SOMETHING
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
TOTALLY
WRONG
HOW
CAN
WE
HELP
TO
MAKE
BEST
USE
OF
COMPUTER
TECHNOLOGY
WHEN
LECTURING
IN
THIS
AREA
I
CHALLENGE
MY
NONCHRISTANATHEISTIC
CLASS
ABOUT
THE
IMPACT
TECHNOLOGY
HAS
ON
LIFE
QUALITY
OF
LIFE
AND
THE
RIGHTS
THAT
THEY
CONSIDER
IMPORTANT
DEPENDING
ON
HOW
YOU
WORK
OUT
YOUR
FAITH
WILL
DETERMINE
YOUR
RESPONSE
TO
THE
USE
OF
TECHNOLOGY
FOR
EXAMPLE
FRIENDS
OF
MINE
ARE
CONSIDERING
IVF
DUE
TO
A
LIFE
THREATENING
SITUATION
THE
WIFE
IS
GOING
THROUGH
WHEN
IT
IS
OVER
THEY
WILL
HAVE
THE
BABY
GOD
WILLING
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
TECHNOLOGY
IS
AVAILABLE
AND
MY
FRIENDS
HAVE
TO
DECIDE
WHAT
TO
DO
IN
ALL
CASES
THOUGH
YOU
MUST
DECIDE
IF
THE
TECHNOLOGY
IS
AGAINST
GODS
