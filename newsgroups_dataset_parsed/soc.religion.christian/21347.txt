PETER
WHITE
RELATES
A
STORY
ABOUT
A
PERSON
WHO
GIVES
A
MESSAGE
IN
TONGUES
WHICH
CONSISTS
ENTIRELY
OF
THE
WORDS
PU
KA
HE
WAS
ASKED
TO
REFRAIN
FROM
DOING
THAT
WELL
BROTHER
PUKA
CONTROLLED
HIMSELF
FOR
A
WHILE
BUT
A
FEW
WEEKS
LATER
THE
CHURCH
HAD
INVITED
A
MISSIONARY
IN
TO
SPEAK
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
MEETING
WHERE
TONGUES
AND
INTERPRETATION
WERE
APPROPRIATE
WHO
SHOULD
ARISE
TO
SPEAK
BUT
BROTHER
PUKA
AND
OFF
HE
WENT
AS
BEFORE
ALL
THE
WORDS
WERE
PUKA
THE
PASTOR
WAS
ABOUT
TO
APOLOGIZE
FOR
THIS
EMBARRASSMENT
WHEN
THE
MISSIONARY
AROSE
TO
SPEAK
SAYING
THAT
HE
WAS
SORRY
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
INTERPRETATION
BUT
THAT
HE
COULD
GIVE
THE
TRANSLATION
IN
A
TRIBE
WHERE
HE
HAD
WORKED
THEY
ONLY
HAD
ONE
WORD
IN
THE
LANGUAGE
PUKA
MEANING
WAS
DERIVED
FROM
THE
INFLECTION
AND
OTHER
VOICE
QUALITIES
BROTHER
PUKA
HAD
GIVEN
A
PERFECTLY
INFLECTED
AND
REASONABLE
MESSAGE
NICE
STORY
BUT
IT
SETS
OFF
MY
URBAN
LEGEND
OR
IS
IT
CHARISMATIC
LEGEND
ALARMS
CAN
THE
LINGUISTS
ON
THE
NET
IDENTIFY
THE
LANGUAGE
FROM
THE
DESCRIPTION
OR
CAN
THEY
EVEN
ATTEST
THAT
SUCH
A
LANGUAGE
EXISTS
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
ODD
ENOUGH
AT
LEAST
BY
THE
STANDARDS
OF
EUROPEAN
LANGUAGES
THAT
IF
IT
EXISTS
IT
SHOULD
BE
REASONABLY
WELL
KNOWN
TO
LINGUISTS
AS
AN
EXTREME
CASE
OF
SOMETHING
OR
OTHER
OR
HAVE
I
