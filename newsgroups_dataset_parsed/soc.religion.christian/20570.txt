JOHN
EMERY
WRITES
THE
ONE
SINGLE
HISTORIC
EVENT
THAT
HAS
HAD
THE
BIGGEST
IMPACT
ON
THE
WORLD
OVER
THE
CENTURIES
IS
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
JESUS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
HOTLY
CONTESTED
TOPICS
DID
JESUS
CHRIST
REALLY
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
SINCE
THE
EYEWITNESSES
ARE
NO
LONGER
LIVING
WE
HAVE
ONLY
THEIR
WRITTEN
ACCOUNTS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
SIGNIFICANCE
INVOLVED
HERE
EITHER
THE
RESURRECTION
IS
THE
GREATEST
EVENT
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
MAN
OR
THE
GREATEST
DECEPTION
PLAYED
ON
MAN
MASSIVE
AMOUNTS

JOHN
WHILE
I
WILL
NOT
TAKE
THE
TIME
TO
REBUT
YOU
POINT
BY
POINT
I
WILL
SUGGEST
THREE
CURRENT
WORKS
WHICH
I
THINK
WILL
BE
HELPFUL
IN
YOUR
QUEST
TO
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
JOHN
DOMINIC
CROSSAN
PROFESSOR
OF
RELIGION
AT
DE
PAUL
UNIV
THE
CROSS
THAT
SPOKE
HARPER
AND
ROW
PUB
ALSO
HIS
LATEST
WORK
THE
HISTORICAL
JESUS
THE
LIFE
OF
A
MEDITERRANEAN
JEWISH
PEASANT
HARPER
AND
ROW
PUB
ALSO
TWO
WORKS
OF
BURTON
MACK
PROFESSOR
OF
NEW
TESTAMENT
AT
THE
CLAREMONT
GRADUATE
SCHOOL
A
MYTH
OF
INNOCENCE
FORTRESS
PRESS
AND
HIS
LATEST
BOOK
THE
LOST
GOSPEL
THE
BOOK
OF
Q
AND
CHRISTIAN
ORIGINS
HARPER
AND
ROW
YOU
MIGHT
START
WITH
MACKS
BOOK
ON
Q
AND
THEN
EXAMINE
THE
OTHERS
AFTERWARD
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THAT
ONCE
YOU
DO
THAT
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
YOUR
EVIDENCE
IS
NOT
AS
STURDY
AS
YOUD
LIKE
MOST
OF
THE
TIRED
ARGUEMENTS
YOU
STATED
ASSUME
EYEWITNESS
ACCOUNTS
SUCH
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
BUT
ANYWAY
LOOK
AT
MACK
AND
CROSSAN
AND
THEN
GET
BACK
TO
US
