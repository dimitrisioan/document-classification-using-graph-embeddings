WRITES
ONE
THING
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IS
WHY
BEING
SACRED
SHOULD
MAKE
THE
TEMPLE
RITUALS
SECRET
ON
OF
THE
ATTRIBUTES
OF
BEING
SACRED
IN
THIS
CASE
IS
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
BE
SPOKEN
OF
IN
A
COMMON
MANNER
OR
TRAMPLED
UNDER
FEET
SUCH
AS
THE
LORDS
NAME
IS
TODAY
THE
CEREMONIES
ARE
PERFORMED
IN
THE
TEMPLE
BECAUSE
THE
TEMPLE
HAS
BEEN
SET
ASIDE
AS
BEING
AS
SACREDHOLYUNCOMMON
PLACE
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CEREMONIES
CAN
ONLY
BE
INTERPRETED
CORRECTLY
WHEN
THEY
ARE
VIEWED
WITH
THE
RIGHT
SPIRIT
WHICH
IN
THIS
CASE
IS
IN
THE
TEMPLE
SO
FROM
OUR
POINT
OF
VIEW
WHEN
THEY
ARE
BROUGHT
OUT
INTO
THE
PUBLIC
THEY
ARE
BEING
TRAMPLED
UNDER
FEET
BECAUSE
OF
MISINTERPRETATIONS
AND
MOCKING
AND
IT
IS
THEREFORE
OFFENSIVE
TO
US
PLEASE
DO
NOT
ASSUME
THAT
BECAUSE
OF
MY
USE
OF
THE
WORDS
WE
AND
OUR
THAT
IM
AN
OFFICIAL
SPOKESMAN
FOR
THE
LDS
CHURCH
I
AM
MERELY
STATING
WHAT
I
BELIEVE
IS
THE
GENERAL
FEELING
AMONG
US
OTHERS
FEEL
FREE
TO
DISAGREE
