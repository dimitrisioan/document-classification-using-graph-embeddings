to
one

his
lectures
when
i
asked
why
she
said
ram
das
was
the
greatest
spiritual
leader
of
our
time
several
years
ago
my
wife
got
involved
with
a
religious
cult
and
we
went
through
months
of
hell
that
almost
ended
our
marriage
before
she
quit
lets
just
say
im
concerned
about
this
ram
das
and
her
interest
especially
so
with
the
recent
religious
cult
events
from
texas

need
information

im
dealing
with

any
information
about

organizations
shown
above
i
would
be
very
interested
in
your
correspondence
please
reply
via
email
to
me
at
scotthpsddesddhpcom
thank
you
scott
roleson
the
dictionary
of
cults
that
i
use
classifies
this
as
new
age
with
a
basically
hindu
orientation
the
headquarters
is
or
was
when
this
was
written
at
that
lama
foundation
which
they
identify
as
a
new
age
commune
in
san
cristobel
new
mexico
for
information
you
might
read
alperts
books
which
they
list
as
be
here
now
an
autobiography
the
only
dance
there
is
and
grist
for
the
mill
it
is
dealt
with
briefly
in
a
citation
given
as
larson
new
book
pp
i
assume
this
is
bob
larson
larsons
new
book
of
cults
id
warn
you
however
that
the
whole
approach
to
the
new
age
is
controversial
sources
such
as
the
reference
book
i
used
as
well
as
bob
larson
believe
in
a
satanic
new
age
conspiracy
which
some
regard
as
hysterical
however
at
the
very
least
it
seems
clear
that
this
is
not
a
christian
group
