RE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
ESP
SIRACH
BARNEY
RESSON
WRITES
ON
THESE
COUNTS
THE
APOCRAPHA
FALLS
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
TO
QUOTE
UNGERS
BIBLE
DICTIONARY
ON
THE
APOCRAPHA
THEY
ABOUND
IN
HISTORICAL
AND
GEOGRAPHICAL
INACCURACIES
AND
ANACHRONISMS
SO
DO
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
BIBLE
WHEN
TAKEN
LITERALLY
IE
THE
PSALMS
SAYING
THE
EARTH
DOES
NOT
MOVE
OR
THE
IMPLICATION
THE
EARTH
IS
FLAT
WITH
FOUR
CORNERS
ETC
THE
BIBLE
WAS
WRITTEN
TO
TEACH
SALVATION
NOT
HISTORY
OR
SCIENCE
THEY
TEACH
DOCTRINES
WHICH
ARE
FALSE
AND
FOSTER
PRACTICES
WHICH
ARE
AT
VARIANCE
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
WHAT
ONES
PARYERS
FOR
THE
DEAD
OR
THE
INTERCESSION
OF
SAINTS
WHICH
ARE
TAUGHT
IN
MACCABEES
SIRACH
AND
TOBIT
THEY
RESORT
TO
LITERARY
TYPES
AND
DISPLAY
AN
ARTIFICIALITY
OF
SUBJECT
MATTER
AND
STYLING
OUT
OF
KEEPING
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
BY
YOUR
OWN
SUBJECTIVE
JUDGEMENT
THIS
FALLING
SHORT
IS
YOUR
JUDGEMENT
AND
YOU
ARE
NOT
INFALLIBLE
RATHER
THE
CHURCH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
SEE
TIMOTHY
THEY
LACK
THE
DISTINCTIVE
ELEMENTS
WHICH
GIVE
GENUINE
SCRIPTURE
THEIR
DIVINE
CHARACTER
SUCH
AS
PROPHETIC
POWER
AND
POETIC
AND
RELIGIOUS
FEELING
MORE
SUBJECTIVE
FEELINGS
THIS
IS
NOT
A
PROOF
OF
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
ONE
PERSONS
FEELINGS
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
ARGUMENT
LIES
IN
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
HEBREW
CANON
INCLUDED
THE
APOCRAPHA
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
IT
WASNT
UNTIL
THE
SIXTEENTH
CENTURY
THAT
LUTHER
AND
CO
THREW
THEM
OUT
THE
JEWISH
COUNCIL
YOU
MENTIONED
PREVIOUSLY
DIDNT
ACCEPT
THEM
SO
THE
REFORMATION
PROTESTANTS
HAD
GOOD
HISTORICAL
PRECEDENCE
FOR
THEIR
ACTIONS
JEROME
ONLY
TRANSLATED
THE
APOCRAPHA
UNDER
PROTEST
AND
IT
WAS
LITERALLY
OVER
HIS
DEAD
BODY
THAT
IT
WAS
INCLUDED
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
CANON
AS
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
TIME
AND
AGAIN
THE
HEBREW
CANON
WAS
FIXED
IN
JAMNIA
PALESTINE
IN
AD
YEARS
AFTER
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
ONE
HOLY
CATHOLIC
AND
APOSTOLIC
CHURCH
FURTHERMORE
THE
OPINONS
OF
JEROME
DO
NOT
COUNT
HE
WAS
NEITHER
THE
CHURCH
OR
THE
POPE
OR
AN
ECUMENICAL
COUNCIL
OR
A
COUNCIL
IN
GENERAL
OR
AN
INSTURMENT
OF
THE
MAGISTERIUM
OF
THE
CHURCH
HE
WAS
A
PRIVATE
INDIVIDUAL
LEARNED
ADMITTEDLY
BUT
SUBJECT
TO
ERRO
OF
OPINION
AND
IN
EXLCUDING
THE
DEUTEROCANON
HE
ERRED
AS
POPE
DAMSUS
AND
THE
COUNCIL
OF
CARTHAGE
AND
THE
TRADITION
OF
THE
FATHERS
CLEARLY
SHOWS
AS
I
POINTED
OUT
IN
MY
PREVIOUS
POST
HOW
DO
YOU
THEN
VIEW
THE
WORDS
I
WARN
EVERYONE
WHO
HEARS
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
PROPHECY
OF
THIS
BOOK
IF
ANYONE
ADDS
ANYTHING
TO
THEM
GOD
WILL
ADD
TO
HIM
THE
PLAGUES
DESCRIBED
IN
THIS
BOOK
AND
IF
ANYONE
TAKES
AWAY
FROM
THIS
BOOK
THE
PROPHECY
GOD
WILL
TAKE
AWAY
FROM
HIM
HIS
SHARE
IN
THE
TREE
OF
LIFE
AND
IN
THE
HOLY
CITY
REV
I
SUGGEST
YOU
TAKE
HEED
OF
THE
LAST
PART
OF
THE
STATEMENT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
TAKE
IT
IN
THE
SENSE
YOU
ARE
TAKING
IT
THAT
TAKING
AWAY
FROM
THE
BOOK
WILL
CAUSE
YOU
TO
LOSE
HEAVEN
IT
IS
ALSO
NOTEWORTHY
TO
CONSIDER
JESUS
ATTITUDE
HE
HAD
NO
ARGUMENT
WITH
THE
PHARISEES
OVER
ANY
OF
THE
OT
CANON
JOHN
AND
EXPLAINED
TO
HIS
FOLLOWERS
ON
THE
ROAD
TO
EMMAUS
THAT
IN
THE
LAW
PROPHETS
AND
PSALMS
WHICH
REFERRED
TO
HIM
THE
OT
DIVISION
OF
SCRIPTURE
LUKE
AS
WELL
AS
IN
LUKE
TAKING
GENESIS
TO
CHRONICLES
THE
JEWISH
ORDER
WE
WOULD
SAY
GENESIS
TO
MALACHI
AS
SCRIPTURE
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
CANON
IS
UNIMPORTANT
IT
IS
THE
CONTENT
THAT
MATTERS
NONE
OF
JESUS
STATMENTS
EXLCUDE
THE
DEUTEROCANON
WHICH
WERE
INTERSPERSED
THROUGHOUT
THE
CANON
AND
REMEBER
THERE
ARE
SOME
COMPLETELY
UNDISPUTED
BOOKS
EZRA
NEHEMIAH
ESTHER
ECCLESIATSES
SONG
OF
SONGS
JOB
ETC
THAT
ARE
NOT
QUOTED
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
WHICH
IS
NOT
TAKEN
AS
PREJUDICIAL
TO
THEIR
BEING
INSPIRED
ANDY
