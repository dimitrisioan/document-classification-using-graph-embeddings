when
are
two
people
married
in
gods
eyes

would
like
to
get
your
opinions
on
this
when
exactly
does
an
engaged
couple
become
married
in
gods
eyes
im
waiting
for
an
rc
to
speak
up
nobody
has
so
i
will
those
with
bibles
on
hand
can
give
the
exact
chapter
verse
at
the
time
jesus
told
peter
that
he
was
the
rock
he
said
whatever
you
hold
true
on
earth
is
held
true
in
heaven
and
whatever
you
dont
hold
true
wont
be
true
in
heaven
therefore
with
respect
to
marriage
the
ceremony
has
to
be
done
by
an
rc
priest
no
big
parties
required

priest

are
granted
upon
approval
by

bishop
or
the
pope
not

pope
delegates
this
function
