RE
CHRIST
REFERENCES
IN
OT
ADAM
I
JUST
FINISHED
A
STUDY
ON
THIS
NOT
ONLY
LOOKING
AT
THE
PROPHECIES
THEMSELVES
BUT
WHERE
THEY
WERE
FULFILLED
WHILE
GOING
ONLY
THROUGH
THE
OT
I
FOUND
REFERENCES
AFTER
STARTING
TO
SHOW
THEIR
FULFILLMENT
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
I
HAD
MISSED
SOME
SO
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
I
CANNOT
POST
THEM
HERE
HOWEVER
THE
STUDY
I
DID
I
INTEND
TO
PUBLISH
I
AM
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
ORGANIZING
AND
SHOWING
THE
FULFILLMENTS
THEN
I
WILL
BE
READY
TO
WRITE
AND
SEND
IT
TO
A
PUBLISHER
WITH
ANY
LUCK
ANDOR
FREE
TIME
I
SHOULD
HAVE
IT
FINALLY
DONE
SOMETIME
AROUND
SEPTEMBER
I
HOPE
