RE
ANCIENT
BOOKS
I
SENT
IN
SOMETHING
ON
THIS
BEFORE
BUT
I
BELIEVE
IT
GOT
LOST
IN
THE
WEEKEND
ACCIDENT
THE
MODERATOR
DESCRIBED
THIS
IS
AN
IMPROVED
VERSION
ANYWAY
SO
NO
LOSS
THE
FIRST
TIME
HL
THE
STANDARD
WORK
ON
DETECTING
FORGERIES
OF
ANCIENT
DOCUMENTS
IS
PROBABLY
THE
WRITING
OF
FRIEDRICH
BLASS
HERMENEUTRIK
UND
KRITIK
EINLEITENDE
UND
HILFSDISZIPLINEN
VOL
OF
HANDBUCH
DER
KLASSISCHEN

NOERDLINGEN
BECK
PORTIONS
OF
THIS
ARE
DESCRIBED
IN
NIBLEY
THE
PROPHETIC
BOOK
OP
MORMON
PP
SLC
DESERET
BOOK
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
ATTEMPT
READING
THIS
BE
FOREWARNED
NIBLEY
DESCRIBES
BLASS
AS
A
TYPICAL
GERMAN
SCHOLAR
WHO
CLAIMS
LITTLE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
HIS
SUBJECT
THEN
PROCEEDS
TO
EXHAUST
BOTH
THE
SUBJECT
AND
THE
READER
NIBLEYS
EXTRACT
FROM
BLASSS
WORK
IS
IN
THE
FORM
OF
RULES
FOR
FORGERS
IT
MAKES
INTERESTING
READING
I
CONFESS
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
READ
BLASSS
WORK
ONLY
NIBLEYS
EXTRACT
THEREOF
MY
GERMAN
FALLS
FAR
SHORT
OF
WHAT
WOULD
BE
REQUIRED
AND
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
NO
ENGLISH
TRANSLATION
AVAILABLE
HOWEVER
I
BELIEVE
THE
TECHNIQUES
HE
DESCRIBES
ARE
KNOWN
WIDELY
ENOUGH
THAT
ANY
COMPETENT
CLASSICAL
SCHOLAR
COULD
EXAMINE
A
PURPORTEDLY
ANCIENT
DOCUMENT
AND
AT
LEAST
DETERMINE
IF
IT
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
WHAT
ONE
WOULD
EXPECT
OF
A
GENUINE
DOCUMENT
OF
THAT
TIME
FRAME
WE
WILL
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
PROVE
WHO
WROTE
IT
BUT
AT
LEAST
WE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
DETERMINE
WITH
REASONABLE
CONFIDENCE
IF
IT
IS
FROM
THAT
TIME
AND
CULTURE
OR
IS
A
LATER
FORGERY
ACTUALLY
THERE
ARE
TYPES
OF
PURPORTEDLY
ANCIENT
DOCUMENTS
ALLEGED
ACTUAL
HOLOGRAPHS
OR
EARLY
COPIES
THEREOF
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
DEAD
SEA
SCROLLS
THESE
CAN
BE
TESTED
BY
VARIOUS
SCIENTIFIC
MEANS
TO
DETERMINE
THE
AGE
OF
THE
PAPER
INKS
AND
OBJECTS
FOUND
WITH
THEM
THIS
CAN
PROVIDE
A
PRETTY
CLEAR
DATING
OF
THE
ACTUAL
PHYSICAL
OBJECTS
DOCUMENTS
CLAIMING
TO
BE
COPIES
OF
ANCIENT
WORKS
ALTHOUGH
THE
COPY
ITSELF
MAY
BE
MUCH
MORE
RECENT
FOR
EXAMPLE
WE
MIGHT
FIND
A
DOCUMENT
WHICH
MONKS
IN
A
MONASTARY
CLAIM
IS
A
COPY
OF
SOMETHING
FROM
CENTURIES
AGO
PERHAPS
EVEN
HAVING
BEEN
THROUGH
SEVERAL
GENERATIONS
OF
COPISTS
THIS
IS
MORE
OF
A
PROBLEM
BUT
CAN
STILL
BE
TESTED
ALTHOUGH
THE
TEST
IS
NOT
LIKELY
TO
BE
SIMPLE
WE
CANNOT
EXPECT
A
TEST
OF
THE
AGE
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
OBJECTS
TO
TELL
US
MUCH
SO
WE
MUST
CONFINE
OUR
TESTING
TO
THE
TEXT
ITSELF
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
NONE
OF
THESE
TESTS
CAN
TELL
US
IF
THE
DOCUMENT
IS
REALLY
WHAT
IT
CLAIMS
TO
BE
THEY
CAN
ONLY
DATE
THE
DOCUMENT
AND
IDENTIFY
ITS
CULTURE
OF
ORIGIN
FOR
EXAMPLE
IVE
HEARD
OF
A
LETTER
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
WRITTEN
BY
JESUS
HIMSELF
TO
A
KING
IN
WHAT
IS
NOW
IRAQ
IF
THIS
DOCUMENT
WERE
TO
ACTUALLY
TURN
UP
SCHOLARS
COULD
DATE
THE
PAPER
AND
INK
ASSUMING
THEY
HAVE
THE
HOLOGRAPH
THEY
COULD
CHECK
THE
LANGUAGE
CONTENT
AND
WRITING
STYLE
TO
SEE
IF
THEY
ARE
CONSISTENT
WITH
WHAT
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
OF
A
PALESTINIAN
JEW
OF
THAT
TIME
HOWEVER
EVEN
IF
ALL
TEST
RESULTS
WERE
POSITIVE
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
DETERMINE
IF
JESUS
HIMSELF
ACTUALLY
WROTE
IT
WE
WOULD
KNOW
WHAT
TIME
AND
CULTURE
IT
CAME
FROM
BUT
BARRING
A
KNOWN
SAMPLE
OF
JESUS
HANDWRITING
OR
OTHER
CLUES
FOR
COMPARISON
SCHOLARSHIP
MUST
STOP
THERE
THERE
IS
SELDOM
ANY
WAY
TO
DETERMINE
WHO
THE
ACTUAL
AUTHOR
WAS
AS
I
SAY
IM
NO
EXPERT
ON
BLASS
WORK
I
DO
REMEMBER
SOME
OF
THE
TESTS
WHICH
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
ALLEGED
COPIES
OF
ANCIENT
WORKS
SPECIFICALLY
WE
MIGHT
ASK
IS
THE
DOCUMENT
INTERNALLY
CONSISTENT
DOES
IT
CONTRADICT
ITSELF
IF
THE
WORK
IT
IS
SHORT
IT
WOULD
BE
RELATIVELY
EASY
TO
MAINTAIN
INTERNAL
CONSISTENCY
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
A
FORGERY
THE
LONGER
THE
FORGERY
THE
MORE
DIFFICULT
IT
IS
TO
MAINTAIN
CONSISTENCY
FOR
THIS
REASON
MOST
SUCCESSFUL
FORGERS
STICK
TO
SHORT
DOCUMENTS
IS
IT
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
HISTORY
AND
GEOGRAPHY
OF
THE
TIME
AGAIN
A
SHORT
NONSPECIFIC
WORK
MIGHT
NOT
BE
TESTABLE
BUT
IF
THE
WRITING
IS
OF
ANY
SIGNIFICANT
LENGTH
NO
LATTERDAY
FORGER
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
ESCAPE
DETECTION
HERE
WE
LOOK
FOR
THE
MINOR
INCONSPICUOUS
THINGS
WHICH
SOMEONE
FROM
THAT
CULTURE
WOULD
GET
RIGHT
WITHOUT
EVEN
THINKING
ABOUT
IT
BUT
WHICH
A
LATER
FORGER
WOULD
FIND
TOO
NUMEROUS
AND
TRIVIAL
TO
CHECK
THE
DEVIL
IS
IN
THE
DETAILS
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
LITERARY
STYLE
OF
THE
WORK
FIGURES
OF
SPEECH
ETC
ANY
ANCIENT
WRITER
WOULD
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
SPEAK
IN
WAYS
THAT
SEEM
STRANGE
TO
US
ARE
THERE
ANY
SUCH
ODD
PHRASES
IN
THIS
BOOK
IF
SO
DO
THEY
FIT
IN
WITH
THE
CULTURE
OF
COURSE
THERE
ARE
COMPLICATIONS
IF
THE
DOCUMENT
HAS
BEEN
TRANSLATED
OR
POSSIBLY
EVEN
IF
SOMEBODY
JUST
UPDATED
LANGUAGE
WHEN
HE
COPIED
IT
A
FEW
CASES
OF
LANGUAGE
NOT
FROM
THE
CULTURE
CLAIMED
MAY
BE
ALLOWED
IN
RECENT
COPIES
THEY
CAUSE
PROBLEMS
AND
REDUCE
CERTAINTY
TO
BE
SURE
BUT
DONT
NECESSARILY
PROVE
FORGERY
THESE
TESTS
CAN
BE
QUITE
EFFECTIVE
GIVEN
ENOUGH
MATERIAL
TO
WORK
WITH
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
EASY
THEY
REQUIRE
THE
SKILLS
OF
THE
HISTORIAN
THE
LINGUIST
THE
ANTHROPOLOGIST
ETC
THE
QUESTIONS
TO
ASK
ARE
IS
EVERY
ASPECT
OF
THIS
DOCUMENT
CONSISTENT
WITH
WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
CULTURE
OF
CLAIMED
ORIGIN
IF
THERE
ARE
THINGS
WHICH
DONT
FIT
HOW
SIGNIFICANT
ARE
THEY
ARE
PROBLEM
AREAS
DUE
TO
OUR
LACK
OF
KNOWLEDGE
LATER
CHANGES
BY
COPISTS
OR
ARE
THEY
REALLY
SIGNIFICANT
THERE
WILL
OFTEN
BE
SOME
AMBIGUITY
SINCE
WE
NEVER
KNOW
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
THE
CULTURE
THE
END
RESULT
OF
ANY
SUCH
TESTING
IS
OCCASIONALLY
CERTAIN
PARTICULARLY
IN
THE
CASE
OF
HOLOGRAPHS
OR
OTHER
ANCIENT
COPIES
HOWEVER
OFTEN
IT
MAY
JUST
BE
A
PROBABILITY
OR
AN
INDICATION
THAT
THE
DOCUMENT
OR
MAYBE
PARTS
OF
IT
IS
PROBABLY
AUTHENTIC
OR
SOMETIMES
MAYBE
OTHER
PARTS
ARE
LATER
ADDITIONS
THIS
IS
OFTEN
UNSETTLING
TO
A
GENERATION
RAISED
ON
TV
WHERE
ALL
PROBLEMS
ARE
SOLVED
IN
TO
MINUTES
WITH
TIME
OUT
FOR
COMMERCIALS
IT
IS
HOWEVER
THE
REAL
WORLD
AND
WHAT
SCHOLARSHIP
HAS
TO
OFFER
