BABYLON
HAL
HEYDT
WRITES
THAT
WAS
ONLY
THE
FALL
OF
THE
WESTERN
EMPIRE
THE
EASTERN
EMPIRE
CONTINUED
FOR
ANOTHER
YEARSAND
A
KEY
ELEMENT
IN
ITS
FALL
WAS
THE
CHRISTIAN
SACK
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
NOTE
THAT
I
SAID
THE
FALL
OF
ROME
NOT
OF
THE
EMPIRE
THE
ROMAN
EMPIRE
LASTED
UNTIL
WITH
ITS
TRANSFERED
CAPITAL
IN
CONSTANTINOPLE
THE
MAIN
REASON
FOR
ITS
FALL
WAS
NOT
SO
MUCH
THE
SACK
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
BY
THE
MEN
OF
THE
CRUSADE
WHO
WERE
NOT
CHRISTIANS
THEY
HAD
BEEN
EXCOMMUNICATED
DOWN
TO
THE
LAST
MAN
AFTER
ATTACKING
THE
CHRISTIAN
CITY
OF
ZARA
IN
CROATIA
BUT
RATHER
THE
DISASTOROUS
DEFEAT
IN
THE
BATTLE
OF
MAZINKERT
AFTER
THE
TURKS
BREACHED
THE
FRONTIER
IT
WAS
ONLY
A
MATTER
OF
TIME
BEFORE
THE
EMPIRE
FELL
THE
INABILITY
OF
THE
EMPIRE
TO
HOLD
ONTO
THE
RIM
OF
ANATOLIA
WITH
THE
OTTOMANS
AND
RUM
SELJUKS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
SHOULD
BE
QUITE
OBVIOUS
TO
ANY
STUDENT
OF
HISTORY
THE
SACK
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
ONLY
HASTENED
THE
INEVITABLE
ALONG
FOR
IF
THE
GREEKS
HAD
WANTED
TO
SAVE
THEIR
EMPIRE
WHY
WOULD
THEY
NOT
COOPERATE
WITH
THE
CRUSADERS
WHEN
THEY
CAME
TO
DO
BATTLE
WITH
THE
SARACENS
IN
THE
CRUSADES
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
OBSTINACY
OVER
COOPERATING
WITH
PEOPLE
THEY
CONSIDERED
HERETICS
EVEN
THOUGH
THOSE
HERETICS
WERE
FIGHTING
FOR
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
EMPIRE
AND
CHRISTENDOM
IN
DOING
BATTLE
WITH
THE
TURKISH
HORDES
IN
ANATOLIA
EDESSA
LEBANON
PALASTINE
AND
SYRIA
THE
SOME
HORDES
WHO
WERE
TO
LATER
SACK
CONSTANTINOPLE
AND
OVERRUN
