RE
WHAT
WAS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
MAXWELL
C
MUIR
WRITES
JUST
A
QUICK
QUESTION
IF
MARY
WAS
IMMACULATELY
CONCIEVED
SO
SHE
COULD
BE
A
PURE
VESSEL
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
SHE
WAS
WITHOUT
SIN
AND
THEREFORE
THE
PERFECT
MEANING
SINLESS
FEMALE
HUMAN
BEING
IS
THIS
WHY
SHE
IS
HELD
SO
HIGHLY
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
DESPITE
ITS
BASICALLY
PATRIARCHICAL
STRUCTURE
SHE
WAS
IMMACULATELY
CONCEIVED
AND
SO
NEVER
SUBJECT
TO
ORIGINAL
SIN
BUT
ALSO
NEVER
COMMITTED
A
PERSONAL
SIN
IN
HER
WHOLE
LIFE
THIS
WAS
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SPECIAL
DEGREE
OF
GRACE
GRANTED
TO
HER
BY
GOD
SHE
IS
REGARDED
SO
HIGHLY
BECAUSE
OF
HER
SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP
TO
GOD
AND
EVERYTHING
THAT
FLOWS
FROM
THAT
RELATIONSHIP
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
SEES
HER
AS
THE
NEW
EVE
THE
FATHERS
IN
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
USE
THIS
PARTICULAR
FIGURE
A
LOT
EVE
IS
THE
MOTHER
OF
ALL
THE
LIVING
IN
A
GENETIC
SENSE
MARY
IS
THE
MOTHER
OF
ALL
THE
LIVING
IN
THE
ORDER
OF
GRACE
AS
SIN
CAME
THROUGH
EVE
SO
GRACE
JESUS
CHRIST
CAME
THROUGH
MARY
