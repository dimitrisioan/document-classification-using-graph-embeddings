RE
EASTER
WHATS
IN
A
NAME
WAS
RE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DOUBLE
STAN
MICHAEL
COVINGTON
WRITES
AND
THE
SAME
GOES
FOR
OTHER
CULTURAL
PRACTICES
THE
FESTIVAL
OF
EASTER
MAY
POSSIBLY
HAVE
SOME
HISTORICAL
ASSOCIATION
WITH
SOME
PAGAN
FESTIVAL
BUT
TODAY
THERE
ARE
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
NO
CHRISTIANS
WHO
INTEND
TO
HONOR
ANY
KIND
OF
PAGAN
GODDESS
BY
CELEBRATING
EASTER
THAT
ARGUMENT
WOULD
BE
MORE
COMPELLING
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
FOR
THE
ISHTAR
EGGS
AND
ISHTAR
BUNNIES
WHY
MIX
PAGAN
FERTILITY
SYMBOLS
FROM
THE
WORSHIP
OF
THE
PAGAN
GODDESS
OF
FERTILITY
WITH
BIBLICAL
BELIEF
WHAT
WOULD
REALLY
BE
LOST
IF
ALL
OF
YOU
WERE
TO
JUST
DROP
THE
WORD
EASTER
AND
REPLACE
ALL
SUCH
OCCURANCES
WITH
RESURRECTION
SUNDAY
WOULD
YOU
NOT
SHOW
UP
FOR
SERVICES
IF
THEY
WERE
CALLED
RESURRECTION
SUNDAY
SERVICES
RATHER
THAN
EASTER
SERVICES
