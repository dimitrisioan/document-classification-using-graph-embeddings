SCOTT
HOLT
WRITES
HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNERIVE
HEARD
THAT
QUITE
A
BIT
RECENTLY
OFTEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
THE
CONTEXT
REALLY
ISNT
THAT
IMPORTANT
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
THAT
STATEMENT
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
THINK
NOT
HATE
BEGETS
MORE
HATE
NEVER
LOVE
CONSIDER
SOME
SIN
ILL
LEAVE
IT
UNNAMED
SINCE
I
DONT
WANT
THIS
TO
DIGRESS
INTO
AN
ARGUMENT
AS
TO
WHETHER
OR
NOT
SOMETHING
IS
A
SIN
NOW
LETS
APPLY
OUR
HATE
THE
SIN
PHILOSOPHY
AND
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
WE
TRULY
HATE
THE
SIN
THEN
THE
MORE
WE
SEE
IT
THE
STRONGER
OUR
HATRED
OF
IT
WILL
BECOME
EVENTUALLY
THIS
HATE
BECOMES
SO
STRONG
THAT
WE
BECOME
DISGUSTED
WITH
THE
SINNER
AND
EVENTUALLY
COME
TO
HATE
THE
SINNER
IN
ADDITION
OUR
HATRED
OF
THE
SIN
OFTEN
CAUSES
US
TO
SAY
AND
DO
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
TAKEN
PERSONALLY
BY
THE
SINNER
WHO
OFTEN
DOES
NOT
EVEN
BELIEVE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
IS
A
SIN
AFTER
ENOUGH
OF
THIS
THE
SINNER
BEGINS
TO
HATE
US
THEY
CERTAINLY
DONT
LOVE
US
FOR
OUR
CONSTANT
CRITICISM
OF
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
HATE
BUILDS
UP
AND
DRIVES
PEOPLE
AWAY
FROM
GODTHIS
CERTAINLY
CANNOT
BE
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
BUILD
LOVE
I
DONT
AGREE
BUT
I
CAN
ONLY
SPEAK
FOR
MYSELF
I
HAVE
A
GOOD
FRIEND
WHOSE
LIFESTYLE
IS
VERY
SINFUL
DO
I
HATE
THE
THINGS
SHE
DOES
TO
HERSELF
AND
OTHERS
YES
DO
I
HATE
HER
ABSOLUTELY
NOT
IN
FACT
SHE
TELLS
ME
REPEATEDLY
THAT
I
AM
THE
BEST
FRIEND
SHE
HAS
IN
THE
WORLD
I
CARE
ABOUT
HER
VERY
MUCH
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
I
HATE
HOW
SHE
LIVES
HER
LIFE
ITS
VERY
EASY
TO
FALL
INTO
THE
PROGRESSION
YOU
DESCRIBE
ABOVE
IVE
FELT
IT
WITH
MY
FRIEND
MORE
THAN
ONCE
THERE
IS
A
VERY
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
YOUVE
OVERLOOKED
ABOVE
AND
MAKES
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
LOVE
THE
SIN
BUT
HATE
THE
SINNER
BEFORE
I
LOOK
AT
SOMEONE
ELSES
LIFE
AND
SIN
I
LOOK
TO
MYSELF
AND
AM
AS
DISGUSTED
BY
WHAT
I
SEE
IN
ME
AS
I
SEE
IN
OTHERS
PROBABLY
MORE
SELFRIGHTEOUSNESS
IS
CONTRADICTORY
TO
CHRISTIANITY
AND
IS
WHAT
MAKES
THE
PROGRESSION
YOU
DESCRIBE
HAPPEN
IF
A
CHRISTIAN
CAN
TRUTHFULLY
QUOTE
PAUL
AND
SAY
WRETCHED
MAN
THAT
I
AM
ROMANS
NASB
THAT
CHRISTIAN
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
LOVE
THE
SINNER
AND
HATE
THE
SIN
IF
WE
HAVE
THE
ATTITUDE
OF
THE
PHARISEE
WHO
SAID
I
THANK
THEE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
LIKE
OTHER
MEN
LUKE
NASB
WE
WILL
HATE
BOTH
SCOTT
AT
BRANDEIS
BUT
GOD
DEMONSTRATES
HIS
THE
LORD
BLESS
YOU
AND
KEEP
YOU
OWN
LOVE
FOR
US
IN
THAT
THE
LORD
MAKE
HIS
FACE
SHINE
ON
YOU
WHILE
WE
WERE
YET
SINNERS
AND
BE
GRACIOUS
TO
YOU
CHRIST
DIED
FOR
US
THE
LORD
LIFT
UP
HIS
COUNTENANCE
ON
YOU
AND
GIVE
YOU
PEACE
