BRUCE

WRITES
INDEED
LDS
DOCTRINE
GOES
ONE
STEP
FURTHER
AND
IN
SOME
CASES
HOLDS
PARENTS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THEIR
CHILDRENS
SINS
IF
THEY
HAVE
FAILED
TO
BRING
THEM
UP
PROPERLY
CF
DC
NOTE
THAT
THIS
PASSAGE
APPLIES
IT
ONLY
TO
MEMBERS
OF
THE
LDS
CHURCH
I
INCLUDE
THE
KEY
VERSE
DC
BECAUSE
OTHERS
MAY
NOT
HAVE
THE
REFERENCE
AND
AGAIN
INASMUCH
AS
PARENTS
HAVE
CHILDREN
IN
ZION
OR
IN
ANY
OF
HER
STAKES
WHICH
ARE
ORGANIZED
THAT
TEACH
THEM
NOT
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
REPENTANCE
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
THE
SON
OF
THE
LIVING
GOD
AND
OF
BAPTISM
AND
THE
GIFT
OF
THE
HOLY
GHOST
BY
THE
LAYING
ON
OF
THE
HANDS
WHEN
EIGHT
YEARS
OLD
THE
SIN
BE
UPON
THE
HEADS
OF
THE
PARENTS
WHAT
IS
THE
SIN
OF
THE
PARENTS
HI
BRUCE
HOW
DO
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
PRACTICE
WITH
EZEKIEL
EZEKIEL
THE
SOUL
WHO
SINS
IS
THE
ONE
WHO
WILL
DIE
THE
SON
WILL
NOT
SHARE
THE
GUILT
OF
THE
FATHER
NOR
WILL
THE
FATHER
SHARE
THE
GUILT
OF
THE
SON
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS
MAN
WILL
BE
CREDITED
TO
HIM
AND
THE
WICKEDNESS
OF
THE
WICKED
WILL
BE
CHARGED
AGAINST
HIM
IS
EZEKIEL
NOT
TRANSLATED
CORRECTLY
IN
YOUR
EYES
PERHAPS
EZEKIEL
TEACHES
A
CORRECT
PRINCIPLE
HOWEVER
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
FATHERS
AND
SONS
HAVE
EQUAL
KNOWLEDGE
TO
PREPARE
FOR
THE
JUDGMENT
PARENTS
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
TO
TEACH
THEIR
CHILDREN
THE
GOSPEL
AND
OTHER
LIFE
SKILLS
SHOULD
THEY
FAIL
TO
MAKE
A
SUFFICIENT
ATTEMPT
TO
TEACH
THEIR
CHILDREN
THE
PARENT
WOULD
BE
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
NOT
FOR
THEIR
CHILDRENS
SINS
BUT
FOR
NOT
TEACHING
THEM
PROPERLY
WHENEVER
THE
LORD
INSTALLS
SOMEONE
TO
A
POSITION
OF
AUTHORITY
IN
EITHER
THE
FAMILY
OR
THE
CHURCH
HE
EXPECTS
THAT
PERSON
TO
TEACH
THOSE
IN
HIS
CHARGE
IN
EZEKIEL
SOMEONE
CALLED
TO
CARE
FOR
OTHERS
IS
LIKENED
TO
A
WATCHMAN
UNTO
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
IF
THOU
DOST
NOT
SPEAK
TO
WARN
THE
WICKED
FROM
HIS
WAY
THAT
MAN
SHALL
DIE
IN
HIS
INIQUITY
BUT
HIS
BLOOD
WILL
I
REQUIRE
AT
THINE
HAND
NEVERTHELESS
IF
THOU
WARN
THE
WICKED
OF
HIS
WAY
TO
TURN
FROM
IT
IF
HE
DO
NOT
TURN
FROM
HIS
WAY
HE
SHALL
DIE
IN
HIS
INIQUITY
BUT
THOU
HAST
DELIVERED
THY
SOUL
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
DC
PREFACES
THIS
COMMANDMENT
WITH
PARENTS
HAVE
CHILDREN
IN
ZION
I
BELIEVE
ALL
PARENTS
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
TEACHING
THEIR
CHILDREN
WHATEVER
GOOD
PRINCIPLES
THEY
UNDERSTAND
HOWEVER
LDS
PARENTS
ACCEPT
GREATER
RESPONSBILITY
AND
COULD
BE
JUDGED
MORE
STRICTLY
A
IDLER
