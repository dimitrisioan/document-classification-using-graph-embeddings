hello
i
have
seen
two
common
threads
running
through
postings
by
atheists
on
the
newsgroup
and
i
think
that
they
can
be
used
to
explain
each
other
unfortunately
i
dont
have
direct
quotes
handy
atheists
believe
that
when
they
die
they
die
forever
more
correctly
when
people
die
they
cease
to
exist
a
god
who
would
condemn
those
who
fail
to
believe
in
him
to
eternal
death
is
unfair
i
dont
see
what
the
problem
is
to
christians
hell
is
by
definition
eternal
deathexactly
what
atheists
are
expecting
when
they
die
the
idea
ive
gotten
is
that
to
christians
hell
is
like
heaven
afterlife
ie
you
dont
cease
to
exist
but
are
subjected
to
eternal
torture
well
thats
the
orthodox
idea
anyway
eternal
death
if
you
prefer
that
atheists
dont
believe
in
any
sort
of
afterlife
literal
interpreters
of
the
bible
will
have
a
problem
with
this
view
since
the
bible
talks
about
the
fires
of
hell
and
such
personally
i
dont
think
that
people
in
hell
will
be
thrust
into
flame
any
more
than
i
expect
to
jesus
with
a
doubleedged
sword
issuing
from
his
mouthi
treat
both
these
state
ments
as
metaphorical
i
think
its
safe
to
say
that
hell
was
never
intended
metaphorical
certainly
not
the
equivalent
of
ceasing
to
exist
some
christian
concepts
are
indeed
metaphors
but
your
idea
of
hell
is
a
century
interpretation
it
is
of
course
nice
to
see
that
even
christianity
might
evolve
to
fit
the
worldview
of
modern
age
but
i
fear
the
church
will
not
accept
it
understandably
per
haps
because
if
you
accept
that
hell
is
a
metaphor
then
youre
one
step
closer
to
turning
god
into
a
metaphor
as
