parting
question
would
you
have
become
a
christian
if
you
had
not
been
indoctrinated
by
your
parents
you
probably
never
learned
about
any
other
religion
to
make
a
comparative
study
and
therefore
i
claim
you
are
brain
washed
you
write
as
if
noone
ever
became
a
christian
except
people
from
christian
families
this
is
not
true
as
quite
a
few
people
on
this
group
can
attest
including
