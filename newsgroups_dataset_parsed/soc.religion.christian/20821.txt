WRITES
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
MUST
THERE
BE
A
WHY
TO
THIS
I
ASK
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
YOU
ALSO
ASSUME
ABOUT
GOD
NAMELY
THAT
HE
JUST
EXISTS
WITH
NO
WHY
TO
HIS
EXISTENCE
SO
THE
QUESTION
IS
REVERSED
WHY
CANT
WE
ASSUME
THE
UNIVERSE
JUST
EXISTS
AS
YOU
ASSUME
GOD
TO
JUST
EXIST
WHY
MUST
THERE
BE
A
WHY
TO
THE
UNIVERSE
WHETHER
THERE
IS
A
WHY
OR
NOT
WE
HAVE
TO
FIND
IT
THIS
IS
PASCALS
WAGER
IF
THERE
IS
NO
WHY
AND
WE
SPEND
OUR
LIVES
SEARCHING
THEN
WE
HAVE
MERELY
WASTED
OUR
LIVES
WHICH
WERE
MEANINGLESS
ANYWAY
IF
THERE
IS
A
WHY
AND
WE
DONT
SEARCH
FOR
IT
THEN
WE
HAVE
WASTED
OUR
POTENTIALLY
MEANINGFUL
LIVES
SUPPOSE
THE
UNIVERSE
IS
BILLION
YEARS
OLD
AND
SUPPOSE
IT
LASTS
ANOTHER
BILLION
YEARS
SUPPOSE
I
LIVE
TO
BE
THAT
IS
NOTHING
THAT
IS
SO
SMALL
THAT
IT
IS
SCARY
SO
BY
SEARCHING
FOR
THE
WHY
ALONG
WITH
MY
FRIENDS
HERE
ON
EARTH
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
WE
ARENT
SO
SCARED
WHAT
IF
YOU
WOKE
UP
AT
A
PARTY
WITH
NO
MEMORY
AND
EVERYONE
WAS
DISCUSSING
WHO
THE
HOST
MIGHT
BE
THERE
MIGHT
NOT
BE
A
HOST
YOU
SAY
I
SAY
LETS
GO
FIND
HIM
THE
PARTYS
GOING
TO
BE
OVER
SOMETIME
MAYBE
HELL
LET
US
STAY
BECAUSE
WE
RECOGNIZE
OUR
OWN
MORTALITY
WE
HAVE
TO
FIND
THE
WHY
WELL
THEN
BUDDHISM
CONFUCIANISM
TAOISM
HINDUISM
JUDAISM
ZOERASTERISM
SHINTOISM
AND
ISLAM
SHOULD
FIT
THIS
BIT
OF
LOGIC
QUITE
NICELY
ALL
HAVE
DEPTH
ALL
HAVE
ENDURING
VALUES
THUS
ALL
MUST
BE
TRUE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
POINT
BUT
MORE
OF
A
GOOD
POINT
FOR
STUDYING
RELIGION
THAN
IGNORING
IT
SOME
CHRISTIANS
DISAGREE
WITH
ME
BUT
IT
IS
WORTHWHILE
TO
STUDY
DIFFERENT
RELIGIONS
AND
PHILOSOPHIES
AND
GLEAN
THE
TRUTH
FROM
THEM
TO
QUOTE
OF
COURSE
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
TEST
EVERYTHING
AND
KEEP
WHAT
IS
TRUE
