AND
INNOCENCE
HERES
A
NICE
STORY
TO
HELP
EXPLAIN
THE
VIRTUES
OF
PURITY
INNOCENCE
AND
MODESTY
AND
THEIR
IMPORTANCE
THE
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
VIRTUES
THIS
STORY
IS
AN
EXCERPT
TAKEN
FROM
THE
BASKET
OF
FLOWERS
BY
JOHANN
CHRISTOPH
VON
SCHMID
IN
A
CERTAIN
LITTLE
MARKET
TOWN
OVER
A
HUNDRED
YEARS
AGO
THERE
LIVED
AN
UPRIGHT
AND
INTELLIGENT
MAN
NAMED
JACOB
REDE
HE
WAS
MARRIED
TO
A
MOST
VIRTUOUS
YOUNG
WOMAN
AND
THEY
LIVED
HAPPILY
IN
A
HUMBLE
HOME
WHICH
WAS
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
A
LARGE
BEAUTIFUL
VAL
LEY
AFTER
LIVING
MANY
HAPPY
YEARS
TOGETHER
JACOBS
WIFE
DIED
LEAVING
HIM
ALONE
WITH
ONLY
ONE
FRIENDHIS
DAUGHTER
MARY
EVEN
AS
A
CHILD
MARY
WAS
UNCOMMONLY
PRETTY
BUT
AS
SHE
GREW
IN
YEARS
HER
PIETY
HER
INNOCENCE
HER
MODESTY
AND
HER
UNFEIGNED
KINDNE
SS
TOWARDS
ALL
SHE
CAME
IN
CONTACT
WITH
GAVE
TO
HER
BEAUTY
A
RARE
AND
PECULIAR
CHARM
HER
FACE
WAS
LIGHTED
UP
WITH
A
LOOK
OF
SUCH
INDESCRIBABLE
GOODNESS
THAT
IT
SEEMED
ALMOST
AS
THOUGH
ONE
LOOKED
UPON
AN
ANGEL
MARYS
GREATEST
DELIGHT
WAS
THE
BEAUTIFUL
GARDEN
AND
HER
FAVOUR
ITE
FLOWERS
WERE
THE
VIOLET
THE
LILY
AND
THE
ROSE
JACOB
LOVED
TO
POINT
TO
THEM
AS
EMBLEMS
OF
THE
VIRTUES
MOST
BECOMING
TO
HER
GENDER
WHEN
SHE
ONCE
EARLY
IN
MARCH
BROUGHT
THE
FIRST
VIOLET
TO
HIM
AND
JOYFULLY
CALLED
UPON
HIM
TO
ADMIRE
IT
HE
SAID
LET
THE
MODEST
VIOLET
MY
DEAR
MARY
BE
TO
YOU
AN
IMAGE
OF
HUMIL
ITY
AND
OF
THE
BENEVOLENCE
THAT
DOES
GOOD
IN
SECRET
IT
CLOTHES
ITSELF
IN
THE
TENDER
COLOURS
OF
MODESTY
IT
PREFERS
TO
BLOOM
IN
RETIRED
GROTS
IT
FILLS
THE
AIR
WITH
ITS
FRAGRANCE
WHILE
REMAIN
ING
HIDDEN
BENEATH
THE
LEAVES
MAY
YOU
ALSO
MY
DEAR
MARY
BE
LIKE
THE
RETIRING
VIOLET
AVOIDING
VAIN
DISPLAY
NOT
SEEKING
TO
ATTRACT
THE
PUBLIC
EYE
BUT
PREFERRING
EVER
TO
DO
GOOD
IN
QUIETUDE
AND
PEACE
ONE
MORNING
WHEN
THE
ROSES
AND
LILIES
WERE
IN
FULL
BLOOM
AND
THE
GARDEN
APPEARED
IN
ITS
RICHEST
ARRAY
JACOB
SAID
TO
HIS
DAUGHTER
AS
HE
POINTED
OUT
A
BEAUTIFUL
LILY
WHICH
WAS
BEAMING
IN
THE
MORNING
SUN
LET
THE
LILY
MY
DEAR
CHILD
BE
TO
YOU
THE
EMBLEM
OF
PURITY
LOOK
HOW
BEAUTIFUL
HOW
PURE
AND
FAIR
IT
IS
THE
WHI
TEST
LINEN
IS
AS
NOTHING
COMPARED
WITH
THE
PURITY
OF
ITS
PETALS
THEY
ARE
LIKE
THE
SNOW
HAPPY
THE
MAIDEN
WHOSE
HEART
IS
AS
PURE
AND
AS
FREE
FROM
STAIN
BUT
THE
PUREST
OF
ALL
COLOURS
IS
ALSO
THE
HARDEST
TO
PRESERVE
PURE
EASILY
IS
THE
PETAL
OF
THE
LILY
SOILED
TOUCH
IT
BUT
CARELESSLY
OR
ROUGHLY
AND
A
STAIN
IS
LEFT
BEHIND
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
A
WORD
OR
A
THOUGHT
MAY
STAIN
THE
PURITY
OF
INNOCENCE
THEN
POINTING
TO
A
ROSE
HE
SAID
LET
THE
ROSE
MY
DEAR
MARY
BE
TO
YOU
AN
EMBLEM
OF
MODESTY
MORE
BEAUTIFUL
THAN
THE
COLOUR
OF
THE
ROSE
IS
THE
BLUSH
THAT
RISES
TO
THE
CHEEK
OF
A
MODEST
GIRL
IT
IS
A
SIGN
THAT
SHE
IS
STILL
PURE
OF
HEART
AND
INNOCENT
IN
THOUGHT
HAPPY
IS
THE
MAIDEN
WHOM
THE
SUGGESTION
OF
A
THOUGHT
THAT
IS
INDELICATE
WILL
CAUSE
TO
BLUSH
AS
SHE
IS
THUS
PUT
ON
HER
GUARD
AGAINST
THE
APPROACH
OF
DANGER
THE
CHEEKS
WHICH
READILY
BLUSH
WILL
REMAIN
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
WITH
THEIR
ROSEATE
HUE
WHILE
THOSE
WHICH
FAIL
TO
BLUSH
AT
THE
LEAST
INDELICACY
OF
THOUGHT
WILL
SOON
BECOME
PALE
AND
WAN
AND
GO
BEFORE
THEIR
TIME
TO
THE
GRAVE
AMONG
THE
MANY
FRUIT
TREES
THAT
ADORNED
THE
GARDEN
THERE
WAS
ONE
THAT
WAS
PRIZED
ABOVE
ALL
THE
OTHERS
IT
WAS
AN
APPLE
TREE
NOT
MUCH
LARGER
THAN
A
ROSE
BUSH
AND
STOOD
BY
ITSELF
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
GARDEN
MARYS
FATHER
HAD
PLANTED
IT
THE
DAY
THAT
SHE
WAS
BORN
AND
EVERY
YEAR
IT
BORE
A
NUMBER
OF
BEAUTIFUL
APPLES
ONCE
IT
BLOSSOMED
EARLIER
THAN
USUAL
AND
WITH
UNUSUAL
LUXURIANCE
THE
TREE
WAS
ONE
MASS
OF
BLOSSOM
MARY
WAS
SO
DELIGHTED
WITH
IT
THAT
SHE
WENT
EVERY
MORNING
AS
SOON
AS
SHE
WAS
DRESSED
TO
LOOK
AT
IT
ONCE
WHEN
IT
WAS
IN
FULL
BLOOM
SHE
CALLED
TO
HER
FATHER
AND
SAID
LOOK
FATHER
HOW
BEAUTIFUL
WAS
THERE
EVER
SUCH
A
LOVELY
MINGLING
OF
RED
AND
WHITE
THE
WHOLE
TREE
LOOKS
LIKE
ONE
HUGE
BUNCH
OF
FLOWERS
THE
NEXT
MORNING
SHE
HASTENED
INTO
THE
GARDEN
TO
FEAST
HER
EYES
ONCE
MORE
UPON
THE
TREE
BUT
WHAT
WAS
HER
GRIEF
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
FROST
HAD
NIPPED
IT
AND
DESTROYED
ALL
ITS
FLOWERS
THEY
WERE
ALL
BECOME
BROWN
AND
YELLOW
AND
WHEN
THE
SUN
CAME
FORTH
IN
ITS
STRENGTH
THEY
WITHERED
AND
FELL
TO
THE
GROUND
MARY
WEPT
BITTER
TEARS
AT
THE
SIGHT
THEN
SAID
THE
FATHER
THUS
DOES
SINFUL
PLEASURE
DESTROY
THE
BLOOM
OF
YOUTH
OH
MY
CHILD
NEVER
CEASE
TO
REMEMBER
HOW
DREADFUL
IT
IS
TO
BE
SEDUCED
FROM
THE
PATH
OF
RIGHT
BEHOLD
IN
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
APPLE
TREE
AN
IMAGE
OF
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
WANDER
FROM
THE
WAY
IF
THE
HOPES
YOUR
CONDUCT
HITHERTO
HAS
RAISED
IN
MY
HEART
SHOULD
VANISH
NOT
MERELY
FOR
A
DAY
OR
YEAR
BUT
FOR
LIFE
AH
THEN
HOW
MUCH
MORE
BITTER
WOULD
BE
THE
TEARS
WHICH
I
WOULD
SHED
OVER
YOUR
LAPSE
FROM
VIRTUE
THAN
THOSE
WHICH
NOW
COURSE
DOWN
YOUR
CHEEKS
LIFE
WOULD
HAVE
NO
JOYS
FOR
ME
WITH
TEARS
IN
MY
EYES
I
SHOULD
GO
DOWN
SORROWFULLY
TO
MY
GRAVE
AS
HE
SPOKE
THE
TEARS
STOOD
IN
HIS
EYES
MARY
WAS
DEEPLY
MOVED
AND
THE
WORDS
HE
UTTERED
MADE
SO
PROFOUND
AN
IMPRESSION
UPON
HER
MIND
THAT
SHE
NEVER
FORGOT
THEM
UNDER
THE
EYES
OF
A
FATHER
SO
LOVING
AND
WISE
AND
AMID
THE
FLOWERS
OF
HER
GARDEN
MARY
GREW
DAILY
IN
STATURE
AND
INTELLI
GENCE
BLOOMING
AS
A
ROSE
PURE
AS
A
LILY
AND
RETIRING
AS
A
VIOLET
AND
AS
FULL
OF
PROMISE
AS
A
TREE
LADEN
WITH
BLOSSOM
HAPPY
WAS
THE
OLD
MAN
AT
ALL
TIMES
TO
BEHOLD
HOW
PLENTEOUSLY
THE
FRUITS
OF
HIS
GARDEN
REWARDED
HIS
DILIGENT
TOIL
BUT
WITH
HOW
MUCH
MORE
HAPPINESS
AND
CONTENT
DID
HE
MARK
THE
GRACIOUS
EFFECT
PRODUCED
UPON
THE
HEART
AND
MIND
OF
HIS
BELOVED
DAUGHTER
BY
HIS
PIOUS
TEACHING
AND
EXAMPLE
JACOB
PLUCKED
SEVERAL
ROSES
AND
LILIES
TIED
THEM
TOGETHER
IN
A
BUNCH
AND
GAVE
THEM
TO
MARY
WITH
THE
WORDS
THE
LILY
AND
THE
ROSE
SISTER
FLOWERS
AS
THEY
ARE
BELONG
THE
ONE
TO
THE
OTHER
BOTH
INCOMPARABLE
IN
THEIR
BEAUTY
THEY
ARE
REN
DERED
STILL
MORE
LOVELY
BY
BEING
TOGETHER
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
MY
DEAR
CHILD
ARE
INNOCENCE
AND
MODESTY
TWIN
SISTERS
OF
VIRTUE
AND
CANNOT
BE
SEPARATED
THE
GREATEST
AND
MOST
POWERFUL
GUARDIAN
OF
PURITY
IS
THE
THOUGHT
OF
THE
PRESENCE
OF
GOD
INTERNET
SIMONGIAEBCCMONASHEDUAU
VIVA
CRISTO
REY

THE
KING
