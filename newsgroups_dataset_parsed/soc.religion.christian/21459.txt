besides
i
would
rather
spend
an
eternity
in
hell
than
be
beside
god
in
heaven
knowing
even
one
man
would
spend
his
eternal
life
being
scorched
for
his
wrongdoings
this
display
of
bravado
is
no
bluff
ive
no
fear
any
god
or
his
punishment
that
was
my
point
if
i
play
poker
with
monopoly
money
i
can
bet
anything
i
want
but
i
shant
go
to
heaven
it
would
be
against
my
sense
of
humanity
and
compassion
for
my
fellow
man
this
is
exactly
why
christianity
is
missionary
in
nature
not
just
out
of
a
need
to
irritate
the
god
of
both
testaments
are
one
and
the
same
and
in
neither
is
there
evidence
god
is
strictly
love
to
the
people
who
wrote
the
bible
and
to
whom
the
bible
is
written
there
is
evidence
of
love
but
that
is
a
cultural
bias
this
is
a
poor
answer
which
you
neednt
rebut
i
will
now
pull
the
old
bait
and
switch
i
think
you
should
use
the
bible
to
judge
man
not
god
by
that
i
mean
if
your
moral
intuition
doesnt
like
what
is
described
in
the
bible
realize
that
such
things
are
going
on
now
i
will
avoid
the
semantic
arguments
about
the
cause
of
evil
and
ask
what
are
you
doing
to
fight
it
not
you
specifically
but
everyone
including
myself
if
i
dont
like
the
genocide
in
the
bible
what
about
the
genocide
that
goes
on
right
now
to
move
beyond
the
question
of
a
hell
realize
that
many
people
right
now
are
suffering
if
you
think
hell
isnt
fair
and
are
willing
to
sacrifice
everything
just
to
deny
its
existence
what
about
how
life
isnt
fair
right
now
there
is
a
young
mother
with
three
little
kids
who
doesnt
know
how
she
will
get
through
the
day
right
now
there
is
a
sixth
grader
who
is
a
junkie
right
now
there
is
an
old
man
with
no
friends
and
no
money
to
fix
his
tv
instead
of
why
doesnt
god
help
them
ask
why
dont
we
help
them
i
think
you
are
correct
to
challenge
any
christian
who
doesnt
live
his
life
with
the
compassion
you
seem
to
possess
you
want
evidence
of
god
find
someone
who
is
making
a
difference
someone
you
admire
someone
who
has
been
through
some
tough
times
and
has
come
out
with
his
head
up
ask
the
person
how
he
does
it
ask
the
vietnam
vet
who
was
battle
medic
how
he
kept
his
mind
ask
the
woman
who
was
pregnant
at
kept
the
baby
and
now
is
a
successful
business
woman
ask
the
doctor
who
has
operated
on
a
pound
baby
they
wont
all
be
christians
or
even
what
you
might
call
religious
but
there
will
be
something
in
common
god
is
not
defined
in
the
bible
god
is
defined
by
what
is
in
those
peoples
hearts
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
cant
give
intellectual
assent
to
any
description
youve
heard
theyre
all
wrong
anyway
the
compassion
you
already
feel
in
your
heart
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
follow
that
instead
then
come
back
and
read
the
bible
and
youll
see
that
same
thing
described
there
if
nothing
else
makes
sense
hang
on
to
that
idea
that
god
is
love
i
would
say
something
similar
but
in
reverse
order
love
is
god
good
i
guess
we
only
have
to
work
on
your
grammar
