DEUTEROCANONICALS
ESP
SIRACH
DAVE
DAVIS
WRITES
II
THE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
ARE
NOT
IN
THE
CANON
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
QUOTED
BY
THE
NT
AUTHORS
THAT
IS
NOT
QUITE
ACCURATE
OTHERWISE
WE
WOULD
HAVE
THE
BOOK
OF
ENOCH
IN
THE
CANON
AS
DAVE
NOTED
ONE
CAN
SAY
THAT
THE
APOCRYPHA
ARE
NOT
QUOTED
BY
CHRIST
DAVE
ALSO
WRITES
III
THE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
ARE
NOT
IN
THE
CANON
BECAUSE
THEY
TEACH
DOCTRINES
CONTRARY
TO
THE
UNCONTROVERTED
PARTS
OF
THE
CANON
THEN
I
ANSWER
THESE
IS
A
LOGICALLY
INVALID
A
PRIORI
BESIDES
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
OT
TEXTS
WHICH
IN
MANY
PARTS
ARE
SUPERCEDED
BY
THE
NT
IN
THE
XTIAN
VIEW
WOULD
NOT
THIS
SAME
PRINCIPLE
EXCLUDE
ECCLESIASTES
THIS
PRINCIPLE
CANNOT
BE
CONSISTENTLY
APPLIED
I
HAVE
TO
REJECT
YOUR
ARGUMENT
HERE
THE
SPIRIT
SPEAKS
WITH
ONE
VOICE
AND
HE
DOES
NOT
CONTRADICT
HIMSELF
THE
ULTIMATE
TEST
OF
CANONICITY
IS
WHETHER
THE
WORDS
ARE
INSPIRED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
IE
GODBREATHED
IT
IS
A
TEST
WHICH
IS
MORE
GUIDED
BY
FAITH
THAN
BY
REASON
OR
LOGIC
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
DECIDED
THAT
THE
APOCRYPHA
DID
NOT
MEET
THIS
TESTEVEN
THOUGH
SOME
BOOKS
SUCH
AS
THE
WISDOM
OF
BEN
SIRACH
HAVE
THEIR
USES
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
LUTHERAN
HYMN
NOW
THANK
WE
ALL
OUR
GOD
QUOTES
A
PASSAGE
FROM
THIS
BOOK
THE
DEUTEROCANONICAL
BOOKS
WERE
ADDED
MUCH
LATER
IN
THE
CHURCHS
HISTORY
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
SAME
SPIRITUAL
QUALITY
AS
THE
REST
OF
SCRIPTURE
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THE
CHURCH
THAT
ADDED
THESE
BOOKS
WAS
GUIDED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
IN
SO
DOING
AND
THAT
IS
WHERE
THIS
SORT
OF
DISCUSSION
ULTIMATELY
ENDS

NOW
THANK
WE
ALL
OUR
GOD
WITH
HEART
AND
HANDS
AND
VOICES
WHO
WONDROUS
THINGS
HATH
DONE
IN
WHOM
HIS
WORLD
REJOICES
WHO
FROM
OUR
MOTHERS
ARMS
HATH
BLESSED
US
ON
OUR
WAY
WITH
COUNTLESS
GIFTS
OF
LOVE
AND
STILL
IS
OUR
TODAY
