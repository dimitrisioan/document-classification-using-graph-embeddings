INTERFAITH
WEDDINGS
HELLO
EVERYONE
LAST
WEEK
I
POSTED
A
SIMILAR
QUESTION
TO
ALTWEDDING
NOW
I
COME
IN
SEARCH
OF
A
DEEPERLEVEL
ANSWER
MY
FIANCE
IS
LUTHERAN
AND
I
AM
CATHOLIC
WE
PLAN
ON
GETTING
MARRIED
IN
HER
CHURCH
BECAUSE
SHE
IS
LIVING
THERE
NOW
AND
I
PLAN
ON
MOVING
THERE
IN
A
MONTH
OR
SO
I
CALLED
MY
CATHOLIC
PRIEST
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
I
NEEDED
TO
DO
IN
ORDER
FOR
THE
MARRIAGE
TO
BE
RECOGNIZED
BY
MY
CHURCH
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THAT
I
HAVE
FOUND
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
HARD
AND
FAST
RULE
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
HOW
THE
CATHOLIC
LAW
FOR
INTERFAITH
WEDDINGS
IS
INTERPRETED
BUT
IM
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
WE
CAN
GET
MARRIED
WITHOUT
TOO
MUCH
PROBLEM
THE
TRICK
LIES
IN
THE
LETTER
OF
DISPENSATION
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
WHY
I
AM
HERE
WHAT
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IS
WHAT
ARE
THE
MAIN
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
LUTHERAN
AND
CATHOLIC
RELIGIONS
MY
PRIEST
MUMBLED
SOMETHING
ABOUT
HOW
THE
EUCHARIST
WAS
UNDERSTOOD
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
IF
TWO
RELIGIONS
COMBINE
SOON
IT
WOULD
BE
THESE
TWO
ANY
HELP
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
THANKS

MUCH

FIRST
WE
MUST
BAND
TOGETHER
AS
FRIENDS
THEN
MEARCILESSLY
CRUSH
OUR
ENEMIES
INTO
PASTE
WEVE
HAD
ENOUGH
CATHOLICPROTESTANT
ARGUMENTS
RECENTLY
THAT
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
ANY
RENEWALS
I
SUGGEST
RESPONSES
VIA
EMAIL
UNLESS
THEY
ARE
CLEARLY
NONCONTROVERSIAL
I
WOULD
BE
HAPPY
TO
SEE
POSITIVE
SUMMARIES
OF
BOTH
IMPORTANT
CATHOLIC
AND
LUTHERAN
BELIEFS
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
THEYD
BE
USEFUL
FOR
THE
FAQ
COLLECTION
BUT
IM
NOT
UP
FOR
YET
ANOTHER
BATTLE
