anyone
who
thinks
being
gay
and
christianity
are
not
compatible
should
check
out
dignity
integrity
more
light
presbyterian
churches
affirmation
mcc
churches
etc
meet
some
gay
christians
find
out
who
they
are
pray
with
them
discuss
scripture
with
them
and
only
then
form
your
opinion
if
you
were
to
start
your
own
religion
this
would
be
fine
but
there
is
no
scriptural
basis
for
your
statement
how
about
acts
or
i
john
which
says
to
try
the
spirits
to
see
if
they
be
of
god
in
fact
it
really
gets
to
the
heart
of
the
problem
you
think
you
know
more
than
scripture
your
faith
is
driven
by
feel
goodism
and
not
by
the
word
of
god
how
do
you
know
when
have
you
tried
to
learn
anything
about
me
