PROOF
OF
RESURECTION
I
HAVE
A
FEW
MINOR
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
ARTICLE
POSTED
AS
PROOF
OF
CHRISTS
RESURRECTION
FIRST
THE
SCRIPTURAL
QUOTATIONS
THIS
SORT
OF
REASONING
IS
SUCH
THAT
IF
YOU
BELEIVE
YOU
ARE
JUSTIFIED
IF
NOT
THEN
YOUR
BELEIF
IS
IN
VAIN
SO
YOU
MIGHT
AS
WELL
BELEIVE
MOST
OF
THESE
QUOTATIONS
ARE
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
BELEIVE
PEOPLE
WHO
WOULD
TRY
TO
JUSTIFY
THEIR
OWN
POSITIONS
SECOND
THE
LOGICAL
PROOF
QUOTED
TEXT
FROM
FAMILY
MAGAZINE
SYSOPS
SUBJECT
WITNESS
PROOF
OF
CHRISTS
RESURRECTION
DATE
APR
GMT
MUCH
DELETED
IN
NEARLY
CENTURIES
NO
BODY
HAS
EVER
BEEN
PRODUCED
TO
REFUTE
JESUS
ASSERTION
THAT
HE
WOULD
INDEED
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
PERPETRATE
SUCH
A
HOAX
SUCCESSFULLY
UPON
THE
ENTIRE
WORLD
FOR
NEARLY
CENTURIES
IS
ASTRONOMICALLY
NEGATIVE
END
QUOTED
TEXT
THE
PERIOD
OF
TIME
THAT
HAS
ELAPSED
FROM
THE
EVENT
GROWING
LARGER
DOES
NOT
INCREASE
THE
ODDS
THAT
A
HOAX
WOULD
BE
DISCOVERED
IN
FACT
THE
LONGER
A
HOAX
IS
PERPETUATED
THE
STRONGER
IT
BECOMES
FINALLY
THERE
IS
NO
PROOF
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
CHRIST
EXCEPT
IN
OUR
SPIRITS
COMMUNION
WITH
HIS
AND
THE
FATHERS
IT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
BELIEF
WITHOUT
LOGICAL
PROOF
INCEDENTLY
ONE
OF
THE
LARGEST
STUMBLING
BLOCKS
FOR
RATIONAL
WESTERN
MAN
MYSELF
INCLUDED
I
HOPE
THAT
THIS
IS
TAKEN
IN
THE
SPIRIT
IT
WAS
INTENDED
AND
NOT
AS
A
REJECTION
OF
THE
RESURRECTIONS
OCCURANCE
I
BELEIVE
BUT
I
WANTED
TO
POINT
OUT
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
LOGICAL
PROOFS
