RE
SOME
QUESTIONS
FROM
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
STEVEN
R
HOSKINS
WRITES
I
REALIZE
I
AM
VERY
IGNORANT
ABOUT
MUCH
OF
THE
BIBLE
AND
QUITE
POSSIBLY
ABOUT
WHAT
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
HOLD
AS
TRUE
THIS
I
AM
TRYING
TO
RECTIFY
BY
READING
THE
BIBLE
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
HELPFUL
TO
ALSO
READ
A
GOOD
INTERPRETATIONCOMMENTARY
ON
THE
BIBLE
OR
OTHER
RELEVANT
ASPECTS
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
ONE
OF
MY
QUESTIONS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
IS
CAN
ANYONE
RECOMMEND
A
GOOD
READING
LIST
OF
THEOLOGICAL
WORKS
INTENDED
FOR
A
LAY
PERSON
I
WONT
EVEN
RECOMMEND
BOOKS
FROM
MY
CONGREGATION
WHAT
YOU
ASK
SOUNDS
ATTRACTIVE
BUT
IT
IS
DANGEROUS
AS
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
BE
CONTAMINATED
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLES
INTERPRETATION
STEEP
YOUR
SELF
IN
SCRIPTURE
AND
DISCUSS
WITH
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
READ
IF
YOUR
MUST
BUT
REMEMBER
THAT
WHAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
WRITE
IS
THEIR
INTERPRETATION
GOD
HAS
PROMISED
TO
GIVE
YOU
LIGHT
SO
ASK
FOR
IT
I
HAVE
ANOTHER
QUESTION
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
I
AM
NOT
YET
AFFILIATED
WITH
ANY
ONE
CONGREGATION
ASIDE
FROM
MATTERS
OF
TASTE
WHAT
CRITERIA
SHOULD
ONE
USE
IN
CHOOSING
A
CHURCH
I
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
VARIOUS
PROTESTANT
DENOMINATIONS
DONT
WAIT
TOO
LONG
BEFORE
ATTACHING
YOURSELF
TO
CHURCH
JUST
REMEMBER
TO
ALWAYS
COMPARE
WHAT
THEY
TEACH
YOU
WITH
SCRIPTURE
LIKE
THE
BEREANS
DID
DARIUS
