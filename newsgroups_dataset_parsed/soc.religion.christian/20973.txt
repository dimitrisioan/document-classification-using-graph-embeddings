RE
DOES
JUSTJUSTIFIABLE
WAR
EXIST
SOME
THOUGHTS
A
ON
THE
NONPACIFIST
SIDE
KILLING
TO
DEFEND
THE
INNOCENT
MAY
BE
IF
ANYTHING
MORE
JUSTIFIABLE
THAN
KILLING
IN
SELFDEFENSE
I
CAN
TURN
MY
OWN
OTHER
CHEEK
BUT
I
HAVE
NO
RIGHT
TO
TURN
SOMEONE
ELSES
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
IF
JESUS
HAD
MEANT
TO
TEACH
PACIFISM
HE
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
HIS
POSITION
MORE
EXPLICIT
HE
DIDNT
TELL
THE
CENTURION
TO
LEAVE
THE
ARMY
FOR
INSTANCE
AND
THE
NT
IS
FULL
OF
MILITARY
METAPHORS
B
ON
THE
PACIFIST
SIDE
APPARENTLY
MANY
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
REFUSED
TO
FIGHT
IN
THE
ROMAN
ARMY
OR
STATED
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
REFUSE
IF
GIVEN
A
CHOICE
BUT
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
OBJECTING
TO
WAR
PER
SE
OR
OBJECTING
TO
ROMAN
POLICIES
IN
MODERN
WARFARE
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DIRECT
ATTACKS
ONLY
AT
COMBATANTS
BOMBING
BOTH
CONVENTIONAL
AND
NUCLEAR
KILLS
LOTS
OF
CIVILIANS
ITS
HARD
TO
TELL
WHETHER
ANY
PARTICULAR
WAR
IS
JUSTIFIED
AT
THE
TIME
OFTEN
IT
TAKES
DECADES
