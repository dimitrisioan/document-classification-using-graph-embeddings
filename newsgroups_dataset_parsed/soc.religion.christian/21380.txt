CANT
SOMEONE
DESCRIBE
SOMEONES
TRINITY
IN
SIMPLE
DECLARATIVE
SENTENCES
WITH
WORDS
THAT
HAVE
COMMON
MEANING
THE
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
APPEARS
TO
BE
NO
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SUBMIT
THE
FOLLOWING
WHICH
HELPED
ME
ENORMOUSLY
IF
IT
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
POSTED
I
APOLOGIZE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
DURING
THE
MIDDLE
AGES
IT
WAS
CUSTOMARY
FOR
PASTORS
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
TRINITY
TO
THEIR
PARISHONERS
BY
ANALOGY
TO
WATER
WATER
IS
WATER
BUT
CAN
EXIST
IN
THREE
FORMSLIQUID
ICE
AND
VAPOR
THUS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
ONE
ESSENCE
TO
EXIST
IN
THREE
FORMS
AND
RECENTLY
THE
PASTOR
OF
MY
CHURCH
DREW
AN
ANALOGY
WHICH
I
ALSO
FOUND
USEFULA
WOMAN
IS
OFTEN
PERCIEVED
BY
OTHERS
IN
THREE
WAYS
DEPENDING
ON
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
TO
HERA
MOTHER
A
WIFE
AND
AN
EMPLOYEE
IN
A
BUSINESS
THUS
IT
SEEMS
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
THE
ESSENCE
OF
GOD
CAN
SUBSIST
IN
THE
FATHER
SON
AND
HOLY
SPIRIT
OR
DEPENDING
ON
ONES
PARTICULAR
NEED
FOR
HIM
