HOMOSEXUALS
SEVERAL
REPLIES
TO
MY
POST
HAVE
SAID
THAT
I
SHOULD
GET
TO
KNOW
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALS
BEFORE
JUDGING
THEM
I
MAINTAIN
THAT
I
WAS
NOT
JUDGING
THEM
BY
SAYING
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
WRONG
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
RESPONCES
TO
MY
POST
AND
MAKE
A
GENERAL
STEROTYPICAL
EVALUATION
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
RESPONDED
TO
THE
SIDE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
BEING
COMPATIBLE
ADMITEDLY
NOT
ALL
ARE
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
I
KNOW
THAT
MANY
ARE
FROM
THEIR
EMAIL
RESPONCES
I
DONT
NORMALLY
MAKE
STEROTYPICAL
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
GROUPS
OF
PEOPLE
BUT
SINCE
I
HAVE
BEEN
ASKED
TO
BY
MANY
OF
THE
OPPOSING
VEIW
POINT
I
WILL
SO
FAR
PEOPLE
HAVE
MADE
WILD
ASSUMPTIONS
PUT
ME
DOWN
BECAUSE
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
RESOURCES
OF
OTHERS
AND
EVEN
REVERTED
TO
NAME
CALLING
IF
YOU
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
AN
ACURATE
REPRESENTATION
THEN
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
ARE
HOMOSEXUAL
CHRISTIANS
SHOW
ME
THE
DIFFRENCE
IN
CHRISTS
