PALO
WRITES
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
PRECLUDES
THE
IDEA
OF
REPEATED
LIVES
ON
EARTH
DOESNT
IT
SAY
SOMEWHERE
IT
IS
APPOINTED
TO
MAN
ONCE
TO
DIE
AND
THEN
JUDGEMENT
I
DONT
HAVE
A
CONCORDANCE
HERE
BUT
I
HAVE
SOME
DIM
MEMORY
THAT
THIS
APPEARS
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
GIVEN
A
FAIRLY
SPECIFIC
CONTEXT
FOR
WHAT
JUDGEMENT
IS
ID
SAY
THAT
MORE
OR
LESS
DECIDES
THE
ISSUE
HEB
CLH
THAT
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
THIS
VERSE
IS
READ
THERE
ARE
AT
LEAST
TWO
MEANINGS
OF
THE
WORD
ONCE
ONLY
ONE
TIME
AND
AT
SOME
OTHER
TIME
IE
ONCE
UPON
A
TIME
NOTE
THAT
IN
THE
PREVIOUS
VERSE
THE
WORD
ONCE
IS
USED
WITH
THE
SECOND
MEANING
AND
ALSO
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
VERSE
ONCE
IS
AGAIN
USED
WITH
THE
SECOND
MEANING
THE
GREEK
I
AM
SURE
USES
DIFFERENT
WORDS
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
TWO
MEANINGS
FOR
THE
ENGLISH
WORD
ONCE
I
AM
NOT
A
GREEK
SCHOLAR
BUT
IM
SURE
SOMEONE
HERE
CAN
VERIFY
WHICH
GREEK
WORD
IS
USED
HERE
FOR
THIS
MEANING
IF
THE
SECOND
MEANING
IS
BEING
USED
THAT
VERSE
CAN
BE
INTERPRETED
AS
FOR
IT
WAS
ONCE
GIVEN
FOR
MEN
TO
DIE
BEGINNING
WITH
ADAM
BUT
AFTER
THIS
GIFT
OF
ATONEMENT
OFFERED
BY
JESUS
CHRIST
THE
JUDGEMENT
IS
MADE
AVAILABLE
FOR
NOW
THERE
IS
NO
LONGER
DEATH
BUT
LIFE
WITH
CHRIST
