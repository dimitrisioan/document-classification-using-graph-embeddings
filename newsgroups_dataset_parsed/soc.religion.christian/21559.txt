BRYAN
WHITSELL
SENT
IN
A
LIST
OF
VERSES
WHICH
HE
FELT
CONDEMN
HOMOSEXUALITY
MLSPANIXCOM
MICHAEL
SIEMON
WROTE
IN
RESPONSE
THAT
SOME
OF
THESE
VERSES
ARE
USED
AGAINST
US
ONLY
THROUGH
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
INTERPRETATIONS
AND
THAT
OTHERS
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUES
IN
RESPONSE
I
WROTE
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
ABOVE
VERSES
DO
NOT
CLEARLY
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUES
HOWEVER
A
COUPLE
OF
THEM
SEEM
AS
THOUGH
THEY
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
INTERPRETATIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
SEEN
AS
CONDEMNING
HOMOSEXUALITY
DO
NOT
BE
DECEIVED
NEITHER
FORNICATORS
NOR
IDOLATORS
NOR
ADULTERERS
NOR
EFFEMINATE
NOR
HOMOSEXUALS
NOR
THIEVES
NOR
THE
COVETOUS
NOR
DRUNKARDS
NOR
REVILERS
NOR
SWINDLERS
SHALL
INHERIT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
SUCH
WERE
SOME
OF
YOU
I
COR
WOULD
SOMEONE
CARE
TO
COMMENT
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ABOVE
SEEMS
TO
SAY
FORNICATORS
WILL
NOT
INHERIT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
HOW
DOES
THIS
APPLY
TO
HOMOSEXUALS
I
UNDERSTAND
FORNICATION
TO
BE
SEX
OUTSIDE
OF
MARRIAGE
IS
THIS
AN
ACCURATE
DEFINITION
IS
THERE
ANY
SUCH
THING
AS
SAMESEX
MARRIAGE
IN
THE
BIBLE
MY
UNDERSTANDING
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THAT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
BLESSES
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
ONLY
BETWEEN
A
HUSBAND
AND
HIS
WIFE
I
AM
HOWEVER
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
SCRIPTURAL
EVIDENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
REMAINDER
OF
MY
POST
DELETED
THE
MODERATOR
THEN
MADE
SOME
COMMENTS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ADDRESS
THERES
SOME
AMBIGUITY
ABOUT
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORDS
IN
THE
PASSAGE
YOU
QUOTE
BOTH
LIBERAL
AND
CONSERVATIVE
SOURCES
SEEM
TO
AGREE
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
IS
NOT
THE
GENERAL
TERM
FOR
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
IS
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
A
MEANING
LIKE
HOMOSEXUAL
PROSTITUTE
THAT
DOESNT
MEANT
THAT
I
THINK
ALL
THE
BIBLICAL
EVIDENCE
VANISHES
BUT
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
SUCH
THAT
YOU
CANT
JUST
QUOTE
ONE
VERSE
AND
SOLVE
THINGS
IF
YOU
ARE
REFERRING
TO
THE
TERMS
EFFEMINATE
AND
HOMOSEXUALS
IN
THE
ABOVE
PASSAGE
I
AGREE
THAT
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
TRANSLATION
HAS
BEEN
CHALLENGED
HOWEVER
I
WAS
SIMPLY
COMMENTING
ON
THE
CHARGE
THAT
IT
IS
AN
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
INTERPRETATION
TO
READ
THIS
AS
A
CONDEMNATION
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
SUCH
A
CHARGE
SEEMS
TO
IMPLY
THAT
NO
REASONABLE
PERSON
WOULD
EVER
CONCLUDE
FROM
THE
VERSE
THAT
PAUL
INTENDED
TO
CONDEMN
HOMOSEXUALITY
HOWEVER
I
THINK
I
CAN
SEE
HOW
A
REASONABLE
PERSON
MIGHT
VERY
WELL
TAKE
THIS
VIEW
OF
THE
VERSE
THEREFORE
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IT
IS
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
TO
READ
IT
IN
THIS
WAY
I
THINK
YOUR
ARGUMENT
FROM
FORNICATION
IS
CIRCULAR
WHY
IS
HOMOSEXUALITY
WRONG
BECAUSE
ITS
FORNICATION
WHY
IS
IT
FORNICATION
BECAUSE
THEYRE
NOT
MARRIED
WHY
ARENT
THEY
MARRIED
BECAUSE
THE
CHURCH
REFUSES
TO
DO
A
MARRIAGE
CEREMONY
WHY
DOES
THE
CHURCH
REFUSE
TO
DO
A
MARRIAGE
CEREMONY
BECAUSE
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
WRONG
IN
ORDER
TO
BREAK
THE
CIRCLE
THERES
GOT
TO
BE
SOME
OTHER
REASON
TO
THINK
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
WRONG
CLH
ACTUALLY
I
WASNT
THINKING
OF
THE
CHURCH
AT
ALL
AFTER
ALL
A
COUPLE
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
BE
MARRIED
BY
A
MINISTER
A
SECULAR
JUSTICE
OF
THE
PEACE
COULD
DO
THE
JOB
AND
THE
TWO
PEOPLE
WOULD
BE
MARRIED
MY
POINT
WAS
THAT
IT
IS
EASY
TO
FIND
A
BIBLICAL
BASIS
FOR
HETEROSEXUAL
MARRIAGE
BUT
WHERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
WOULD
ONE
GET
A
CHRISTIAN
MARRIAGE
BETWEEN
TWO
PEOPLE
OF
THE
SAME
SEX
AND
IF
YOU
DO
SEE
A
BIBLICAL
BASIS
FOR
SAMESEX
MARRIAGES
HOW
WILLING
WOULD
GAY
CHRISTIANS
BE
TO
SAVE
THEMSELVES
FOR
SUCH
A
MARRIAGE
AND
TO
NEVER
HAVE
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
WITH
ANYONE
OUTSIDE
OF
THAT
MARRIAGE
RELATIONSHIP
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
IMPLY
THAT
GAY
CHRISTIANS
WOULD
NOT
BE
WILLING
TO
BE
SO
MONOGAMOUS
I
AM
GENUINELY
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
OPINIONS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
I
HAVE
HEARD
COMMENTS
FROM
GAYS
IN
THE
PAST
THAT
LEAD
ME
TO
BELIEVE
THEY
REGARD
PROMISCUITY
AS
ONE
OF
THE
MAIN
POINTS
OF
BEING
HOMOSEXUAL
YET
I
TEND
TO
DOUBT
THAT
GAYS
WHO
WANT
TO
BE
CHRISTIAN
WOULD
ADVOCATE
SUCH
A
POSITION
SO
WHAT
IS
THE
GAY
VIEW
MARK
YES
I
AGREE
THAT
A
REASONABLE
PERSON
MIGHT
CONCLUDE
THAT
PAUL
IS
CONDEMNING
HOMOSEXUALITY
I
WAS
RESPONDING
TO
CERTAIN
DETAILS
OF
YOUR
POSTING
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
I
AGREE
WITH
MICHAEL
IN
ALL
RESPECTS
