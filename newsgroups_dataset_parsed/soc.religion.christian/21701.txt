RE
HYSLOP
AND
THETWOBABYLONS
IN
ARTICLE
MANGOECSUMDEDU
CHARLEY
WINGATE
WRITES
SEEING
AS
HOW
THETWOBABYLONS
HAS
BEEN
BROUGHT
UP
AGAIN
IT
IS
TIME
FOR
ME
TO
RESPOND
ONCE
AGAIN
AND
SAY
THAT
THIS
BOOK
IS
JUNK
IT
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAT
AN
ANTICATHOLIC
TRACT
OF
THE
SORT
PUBLISHED
EVER
SINCE
THE
THERE
WERE
PROTESTANTS
ITS
SCHOLARSHIP
IS
PHONY
AND
ITS
ASSERTIONS
SPURIOUS
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
THIS
BOOK
THOUGH
I
HAVE
HAD
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
QUOTE
IT
IN
SUPPORT
OF
SOME
TENDENTIOUS
ASSERTIONS
THEY
WERE
MAKING
SO
I
HAVE
BECOME
CURIOUS
ABOUT
IT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
MALIGN
THIS
HISLOP
FELLOW
WHOEVER
HE
MAY
BE
AS
I
HAVE
ONLY
HEARD
THE
ARGUMENTS
AT
SECOND
HAND
BUT
BOTH
OF
THE
ARGUMENTS
SEEMED
TO
TURN
ON
FALSE
ETYMOLOGY
THAT
SEEMED
TO
BE
DERIVED
FROM
HISLOP
I
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
IN
KNOWING
MORE
ABOUT
THESE
THINGS
THE
FIRST
ONE
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
WORD
CHURCH
WAS
DERIVED
FROM
THE
GREEK
CYCLOS
AND
THAT
IT
WAS
THEREFORE
RELATED
TO
THE
WORSHIP
OF
CIRCE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
HISLOP
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
THIS
ASSERTION
BUT
IT
DOES
SEEM
TO
BE
BASED
ON
FALSE
ETYMOLOGY
THE
SECOND
CLAIMED
AN
ETYMOLOGICAL
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
ISHTAR
AND
EASTER
WHICH
SEEMED
TO
BE
EVEN
MORE
FANCIFUL
AND
FARFETCHED
THAN
SOME
OF
THE
WILDER
NOTIONS
OF
THE
BRITISH
ISRAELITES
REGARDING
THE
LATTER
AS
FAR
AS
I
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
FIND
OUT
EASTER
IS
DERIVED
FROM
THE
OLD
ENGLISH
NAME
FOR
APRIL
EOSTURMONATH
THE
VENERABLE
BEDE
MENTIONED
THAT
THIS
WAS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
GODDESS
CALLED
EOSTRE
BUT
APART
FROM
THAT
REFERENCE
I
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
FIND
OUT
ANYTHING
MORE
ABOUT
HER
IT
ALSO
SEEMS
THAT
THE
TERM
EASTER
IS
ONLY
USED
BY
THE
ENGLISH
AND
THOSE
THEY
EVANGELIZED
THE
GERMANS
FOR
EXAMPLE
ALSO
USE
THE
TERM
OSTERN
BUT
GERMANY
WAS
EVANGELIZED
BY
ENGLISH
MISSIONARIES
SO
I
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
IN
ANY
EVIDENCE
OF
EASTER
BEING
USED
FOR
PASCHA
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
KIND
OF
CONNECTION
WITH
THE
ANCIENT
ANGLO
SAXONS
AND
THEIR
OFFSHOOTS
SUCH
EVIDENCE
MIGHT
SUPPORT
THE
CLAIMS
OF
THOSE
WHO
APPEAR
TO
DERIVE
THE
THEORY
