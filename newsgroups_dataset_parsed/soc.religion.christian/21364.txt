QUESTION
ABOUT
MORMON
TEMPLE
RITUALS
DELETED
FOR
BREVITY
JUST
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
INTERJECT
THIS
AND
I
BELIEVE
YOU
DAN
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
DONT
MEAN
TO
OFFEND
FOR
US
LDS
TEMPLE
GOERS
THE
TEMPLE
CEREMONIES
ARE
VERY
SACRED
SO
MUCH
SO
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
GOES
THERE
PROMISES
NEVER
TO
DIVULGE
THEM
SO
HOW
MUCH
CAN
YOU
TRUST
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
TELLING
YOU
ABOUT
THE
CERERMONY
ONE
THING
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IS
WHY
BEING
SACRED
SHOULD
MAKE
THE
TEMPLE
RITUALS
SECRET
THERE
ARE
LOTS
OF
SACRED
THINGS
IN
CHRISTIANITY
INCLUDING
THE
SACRED
SCRIPTURES
THEMSELVES
BUT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
SECRET
ABOUT
THESE
THINGS
IS
IT
APPROPRIATE
FOR
THE
LORD
NOT
TO
REVEAL
CERTAIN
THINGS
BEFORE
THE
WORLD
IE
PUBLISH
THEM
WIDELY
THESE
THINGS
SACRED
TO
HIMSELF
HE
MAY
PLACE
ANY
PRE
OR
POSTCONDITIONS
HE
FEELS
ARE
NECESSARY
MOREOVER
THERE
ARE
PRECEDENTS
IN
SCRIPTURE
WHERE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
SACRED
THINGS
IS
WITHHELD
AFTER
THE
TRANSFIGURATION
JESUS
INSTRUCTED
PETER
JAMES
AND
JOHN
TO
TELL
THE
VISION
TO
NO
MAN
UNTIL
THE
SON
OF
MAN
BE
RISEN
AGAIN
FROM
THE
DEAD
MATT
IF
WE
WERE
LIVING
AT
THE
TIME
OF
SAVIOR
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
PUBLIC
RECORD
OF
THIS
EVENT
A
FAITHFUL
FRIEND
OF
PAUL
EXPERIENCES
A
VISION
OF
PARADISE
WHEN
HE
HEARD
UNSPEAKABLE
WORDS
WHICH
IT
IS
NOT
LAWFUL
FOR
A
MAN
TO
UTTER
COR
THIS
PERSON
HEARD
SOMETHING
WHICH
PAUL
CAN
NOT
WRITE
TO
THE
CORINTHIANS
AND
US
THERE
IS
AN
INCIDENT
RECORDED
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
MORMON
WHERE
WORDS
UTTERED
BY
BABES
WERE
FORBIDDEN
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
NOT
ANY
MAN
WRITE
THEM
NEPHI
THE
ENTIRE
TEXT
FOLLOWS
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WITHOUT
ACCESS
TO
THE
BOM
NEPHI
BEHOLD
IT
CAME
TO
PASS
ON
THE
MORROW
THAT
THE
MULTITUDE
GATHERED
THEMSELVES
TOGETHER
AND
THEY
BOTH
SAW
AND
HEARD
THESE
CHILDREN
YEA
EVEN
BABES
DID
OPEN
THEIR
MOUTHS
AND
UTTER
MARVELOUS
THINGS
AND
THE
THINGS
WHICH
THEY
DID
UTTER
WERE
FORBIDDEN
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
NOT
ANY
MAN
WRITE
THEM
SOME
LDS
SCHOLARS
SPECULATE
THAT
THESE
WORDS
WHICH
COULD
NOT
BE
WRITTEN
ARE
THE
SACRED
PORTIONS
FROM
TEMPLE
WE
ARE
TO
WITHHOLD
FROM
THE
WORLD
BUT
IT
COULD
BE
SOMETHING
ELSE
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
WHY
MORMONS
WOULD
LIMIT
TEMPLE
ACCESS
TO
ONLY
FAITHFUL
MORMONS
BUT
I
HAVE
NEVER
UNDERSTOOD
THE
EMPHASIS
ON
SHROUDING
TEMPLE
RITUAL
IN
MYSTERY
THERE
IS
MUCH
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
ABOUT
THE
TEMPLE
ORDINANCES
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
REGARDING
BAPTISMS
AND
OTHER
VICARIOUS
ORDINANCES
FOR
THE
DEAD
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
CERTAIN
CONCEPTS
REGARDING
THE
ENDOWMENT
THE
RITUAL
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
ELEMENTS
I
CAN
NOT
DISCUSS
WITH
ANYONE
INCLUDING
OTHER
SAINTS
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
TEMPLE
AS
A
PORTION
OF
THE
ENDOWMENT
WE
RECEIVE
THE
TOKENS
AND
SIGNS
THAT
WILL
PERMIT
US
ACCESS
TO
HEAVEN
I
MUST
KEEP
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
SACRED
AND
RESPECT
THE
CONDITIONS
UNDER
WHICH
IT
IS
REVEALED
TO
ME
A
IDLER
