re
question
about
virgin
mary
i
think
youre
talking
about
the
assumption
of
the
blessed
virgin
mary
it
says
that
the
immaculate
mother
of
god
the
ever
virgin
mary
having
completed
the
course
of
her
earthly
life
was
assumed
body
and
soul
into
heavenly
glory
this
was
defined
by
a
papal
statement
in
though
it
had
certainly
been
believed
by
some
before
that
like
the
immaculate
conception
this
is
primarily
a
roman
catholic
doctrine
and
like
it
it
has
no
direct
biblical
support
note
that
catholics
do
not
believe
in
sola
scriptura
that
is
they
do
not
believe
that
the
bible
is
the
only
source
of
christian
knowledge
thus
the
fact
that
a
doctrine
has
little
biblical
support
is
not
necessarily
significant
to
them
they
believe
that
truth
can
be
passed
on
through
traditions
of
the
church
and
also
that
it
can
be
revealed
to
the
church
im
not
interested
in
yet
another
catholicprotestant
argument
but
if
any
catholics
can
tell
us
the
basis
for
these
beliefs
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
clh
in
the
bible
there
are
a
lot
of
instances
where
god
speaks
to
people
where
a
person
just
came
to
know
some
piece
of
information
where
a
person
walks
off
into
the
desert
for
days
etc
with
all
of
gods
power
he
certainly
can
do
whatever
he
wants
when
he
wants
it
the
bible
ends
with
the
book
of
revelations
but
does
gods
reign
end
there
no
so
who
can
say
for
sure
that
gods
messages
are
either
no
longer
happening
or
still
happening
i
can
now
hear
the
clamor
for
proof
with
the
cold
response
ive
gotten
from
the
past
from
this
group
its
very
hard
to
get
the
point
across
ill
only
go
over
the
physical
stuff
so
that
skeptics
can
look
at
documents
stored
somewhere
ive
cited
the
uncorrupted
bodies
of
saints
before
theyre
still
there
the
apparitions
at
fatima
portugal
culminated
in
a
miracle
specifically
granted
to
show
gods
existence
that
was
the
spinningdescending
of
the
sun
it
was
seen
in
several
countries
that
event
is
approved
by
the
pope
currently
images
of
mary
in
japan
korea
yugoslavia
philippines
africa
are
showing
tears
natural
or
blood
these
are
still
under
investigation
by
the
church
but
realize
that
investigations
take
decades
to
finish
and
if
the
message
is
christ
will
come
in
ten
days
thats
a
bit
too
late
isnt
it
other
events
under
investigation
are
inner
locutions
coming
to
know
stigmata
the
person
exhibits
christs
wounds
and
they
dont
heal
and
doctors
dont
know
why
nonbelievers
are
welcome
to
pore
through
documents
im
sure
this
stuff
is
not
like
koresh
or
oral
roberts
give
me
or
god
will
call
me
home
its
free
find
out
why
theyre
happening
as
we
ourselves
are
studying
why
if
anybody
can
figure
this
out
tell
us
you
can
be
of
any
religion
if
you
have
the
resources
go
to
one
of
the
countries
i
mentioned
these
are
not
members
only
events
god
and
mary
invites
everybody
so
in
conclusion
finally
we
rcs
believe
in
the
modern
day
manifestations
of
god
and
mary
we
are
scared
to
death
sometimes
although
were
told
not
to
there
are
more
proofs
and
events
and
that
is
why
not
everything
is
in
the
bible
although
in
a
lot
of
the
apparitions
we
are
told
to
read
the
bible
as
far
as
the
protestant
vs
catholics
issue
is
concerned
in
the
end
gods
churches
will
unite
im
not
sure
how
i
have
some
idea
but
the
point
is
we
shouldnt
worry
about
the
versus
part
just
do
gods
work
thats
all
that
matters
unity
will
come
btw
im
just
a
plain
person
im
not
the
popes
spokesperson
but
i
am
rc

my
opinions
