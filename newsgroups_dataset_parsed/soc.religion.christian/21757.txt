RE
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
OF
PREDESTINATION
STEPHEN
A
CREPS
WRITES
THE
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
OF
PREDESTINATION
DOES
NOT
EXCLUDE
FREE
WILL
IN
ANY
WAY
SINCE
GOD
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
HE
THEREFORE
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
THAT
IS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
TO
US
WE
HAVE
FREE
WILL
AND
ARE
ABLE
TO
CHANGE
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
US
HOWEVER
SINCE
GOD
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
HE
KNOWS
ALL
THE
CHOICES
WE
WILL
MAKE
IN
ADVANCE
GOD
IS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
TIME
TOO
OFTEN
ARGUMENTS
PIT
PREDESTINATION
AGAINST
FREE
WILL
WE
BELIEVE
IN
BOTH
THAT
LAST
SENTENCE
OF
STEVES
IS
AN
IMPORTANT
ONE
TO
REMEMBER
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
THINGS
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
RELIGION
THAT
CANNOT
BE
COMPLETELY
COMPREHENDED
BY
A
HUMAN
BEING
WERE
THIS
NOT
THE
CASE
IT
WOULD
BE
GOOD
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
RELIGION
WAS
MANMADE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
PREDESTINATION
YOU
HAVE
TO
RECONCILE
TWO
THINGS
THAT
WOULD
AT
FIRST
APPEAR
TO
BE
IRRECONCILABLE
THE
SOVEREIGNTY
OF
GODS
WILL
OVER
ALL
THINGS
AND
MANS
FREE
WILL
IN
DECIDING
HIS
OWN
FATE
CATHOLICS
BELIEVE
IN
BOTH
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
ANYONE
HAS
COME
UP
WITH
A
PAT
RECONCILIATION
I
HAVE
OFTEN
THOUGHT
THAT
GOEDELS
FAMOUS
THEOREM
HAS
APPLICABILITY
TO
CATHOLIC
DOGMA
AT
LEAST
IN
AN
ANALOGOUS
SENSE
THERE
ARE
THINGS
THAT
ARE
TRUE
THAT
CANNOT
BE
PROVED
GODS
INTELLECT
IS
FAR
ABOVE
OURS
THERE
ARE
MANY
TRUTHS
THAT
WE
WILL
NEVER
BE
ABLE
TO
UNDERSTAND
