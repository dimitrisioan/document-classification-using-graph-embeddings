RE
PROOF
OF
RESURECTION
JSLEDDSSDCSASUPENNEDU
JAMES
SLEDD
WRITES
FINALLY
THERE
IS
NO
PROOF
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
CHRIST
EXCEPT
IN
OUR
SPIRITS
COMMUNION
WITH
HIS
AND
THE
FATHERS
IT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
BELIEF
WITHOUT
LOGICAL
PROOF
INCEDENTLY
ONE
OF
THE
LARGEST
STUMBLING
BLOCKS
FOR
RATIONAL
WESTERN
MAN
MYSELF
INCLUDED
I
HOPE
THAT
THIS
IS
TAKEN
IN
THE
SPIRIT
IT
WAS
INTENDED
AND
NOT
AS
A
REJECTION
OF
THE
RESURRECTIONS
OCCURANCE
I
BELEIVE
BUT
I
WANTED
TO
POINT
OUT
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
LOGICAL
PROOFS
TERMS
ARE
BEING
USED
IN
A
LOADED
WAY
HERE
LOGICAL
PROOF
IS
AN
EXTREMELY
MESSY
THING
TO
APPLY
TO
REAL
LIFE
IF
YOU
THINK
OTHERWISE
TRY
TO
CONSTRUCT
A
PROOF
THAT
YESTERDAY
HAPPENED
OBVIOUSLY
IT
DID
ANYONE
OLD
ENOUGH
TO
BE
READING
THIS
WAS
THERE
FOR
IT
AND
REMEMBERS
THAT
IT
HAPPENED
BUT
PROOF
A
PROOF
STARTS
WITH
AXIOMS
AND
GOES
SOMEWHERE
YOU
NEED
AXIOMS
TO
TALK
ABOUT
LOGICAL
PROOF
YOU
CAN
SAY
THAT
YOU
REMEMBER
YESTERDAY
AND
THAT
YOU
TAKE
AS
AXIOM
THAT
ANYTHING
YOU
CLEARLY
REMEMBER
HAPPENED
I
COULD
COUNTERCLAIM
THAT
YOU
HALLUCINATED
THE
WHOLE
THING
TO
TALK
ABOUT
PROOFS
OF
HISTORICAL
EVENTS
YOU
HAVE
TO
RELAX
THE
TERMS
A
BIT
YOU
CAN
SHOW
EVIDENCES
NOT
PROOFS
EVIDENCES
OF
THE
RESURRECTED
JESUS
EXIST
PROOFS
DO
NOT
I
THINK
CHRISTIANITY
GOES
DOWN
IN
FLAMES
IF
THE
RESURRECTION
IS
EVER
DISPROVED
I
ALSO
THINK
THAT
THIS
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
AS
THE
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
RESURRECTION
IS
QUITE
GOOD
AS
THESE
THINGS
GO
IT
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
FAIR
TO
CLAIM
THAT
YOU
CAN
ONLY
TAKE
THE
RESURRECTION
ON
FAITH
THERE
ARE
REASONS
TO
BELIEVE
IT
THAT
APPEAL
TO
THE
MIND
TOO
