WRITES
IF
YOU
HAVENT
ACCEPTED
JESUS
ARE
YOUR
SAVIOR
YOURE
TAKING
AN
AWFUL
CHANCE
AS
I
SAY
TO
THE
JEHOVAH
WITNESSES
WHO
NO
LONGER
FREQUENT
MY
DOOR
IF
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
AND
I
AM
WRONG
THEN
I
WILL
HAVE
LIVED
A
GOOD
LIFE
AND
WILL
DIE
AND
CEASE
TO
EXIST
BUT
IF
I
AM
RIGHT
AND
YOU
ARE
WRONG
THEN
YOU
WILL
DIE
AND
SUFFER
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
MAKE
FUN
AT
THIS
POINT
BUT
ITS
LIKE
DIRTY
HARRY
SAID
YOUVE
GOT
TO
ASK
YOURSELF
DO
I
FEEL
LUCKY
WELL
DO
YOU
A
MANS
GOT
TO
KNOW
HIS
LIMITATIONS
DONT
BE
ONE
OF
THE
WHOSOEVER
WONTS
THIS
IS
A
RIDICULOUS
ARGUMENT
FOR
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
SO
THEN
YOU
MIGHT
CONSIDER
SWITCHING
FROM
CHRISTIANITY
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
IF
YOU
WERE
OFFERED
AN
EVEN
MORE
FRIGHTENING
DESCRIPTION
OF
ANOTHER
HELL
HOW
MANY
CHRISTIANS
DO
THINK
THERE
ARE
WHO
VIEW
IT
STRICTLY
AS
AN
INSURANCE
POLICY
NOT
MANY
I
KNOW
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
A
MESSAGE
OF
LOVE
AND
COMPASSION
FOR
OTHERS
A
FAITH
BASED
ON
FEAR
OF
HELL
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
DYSFUNCTIONAL
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
LIKE
A
CHILD
WHO
CRINGES
IN
FEAR
OF
A
PARENTS
PHYSICAL
VIOLENCE
MANY
RELIGIONS
HAVE
CONCRETE
VIEWS
OF
HEAVEN
AND
HELL
WITH
VARIOUS
THREATS
AND
PERSUASIONS
REGARDING
WHO
WILL
GO
WHERE
COMPETITION
OVER
WHO
CAN
ENVISON
THE
WORST
HELL
CAN
HARDLY
NURTURE
THE
IDEA
OF
LOVING
YOUR
NEIGHBOR

YOURSELF
