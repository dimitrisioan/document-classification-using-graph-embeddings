RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ARTICLE
MARK
BAKER
WRITES
VERY
GOOD
AND
REASONABLE
STATEMENTS
ON
AUTHORITY
DELETED
THE
ATHEIST
POSITION
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
AUTHORITIES
THIS
IS
A
REASONABLE
ASSERTION
IN
ITSELF
BUT
IT
LEADS
TO
A
PRACTICAL
DIFFICULTY
IF
YOU
REJECT
ALL
AUTHORITY
OUT
OF
HAND
YOU
REJECT
ALL
POSSIBILITY
OF
EVERY
RECEIVING
INFORMATION
THUS
THE
ATHEIST
POSITION
CAN
NEVER
POSSIBLY
CHANGE
IT
IS
NONFALSIFIABLE
AND
THEREFORE
UNSCINTIFIC
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
THE
ATHIESTS
POSITION
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
PROOF
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
AS
MUCH
AS
SOME
PEOPLE
ACCEPT
THEIR
CHURCH
THEIR
PRIESTS
OR
STRAIGHT
FROM
THEIR
OWN
SCRIPTURES
AS
THE
PROOF
THIS
DOES
NOT
SATISFY
ATHEISTS
ATHEISTS
DO
BELIEVE
IN
RECOGNISABLE
AUTHORITIES
IF
THEY
WERE
AS
DOGMATIC
AS
YOU
CLAIM
THEY
ARE
THEY
WOULD
BE
TRYING
TO
PROVE
EVERY
TIME
THEY
GOT
UP
WHAT
THEY
DISPUTE
IS
THAT
CHURCHES
PRIESTS
SCRIPTURES
ETC
REPRESENT
TRUE
AUTHORITIES
AND
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
TO
DEMAND
SCINTIFIC
OR
RATIONAL
PROOF
OF
GODS
EXISTENCE
IS
TO
DENY
GODS
EXISTENCE
SINCE
NEITHER
SCIENCE
NOR
REASON
CAN
IN
THEIR
VERY
NATURE
PROVE
ANYTHING
ARE
YOU
ASKING
US
TO
BELIEVE
BLINDLY
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
DENY
THAT
PART
OF
US
THAT
MAKES
US
ASK
THE
QUESTION
DOES
GOD
EXIST
IE
SELFAWARENESS
AND
REASON
IF
WE
DO
NOT
USE
OUR
ABILITY
TO
REASON
WE
BECOME
AS
IGNORANT
AS
THE
OTHER
ANIMALS
ON
THIS
EARTH
DOES
GOD
WANT
US
TO
BE
LIKE
THAT
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
THAT
SCIENCE
AND
REASON
CANNOT
PROVE
ANYTHING
HOWEVER
IF
WE
DO
NOT
USE
THEM
WE
CAN
ONLY
THEN
BELIEVE
ON
FAITH
ALONE
AND
SINCE
WE
CAN
ONLY
USE
FAITH
WHY
IS
ONE
PICTURE
OF
GOD
EG
HINDUISM
ANY
LESS
VALID
THAN
ANOTHER
EG
CHRISTIANITY
MARK
BAKER
THE
TASK
IS
NOT
TO
CUT
DOWN
JUNGLES
BUT
TO
IRRIGATE
DESERTS
