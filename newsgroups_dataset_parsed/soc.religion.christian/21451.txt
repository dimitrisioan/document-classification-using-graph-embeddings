MONOPHYSITES

WALKER
IN
ARTICLE
OUR
MODERATOR
COMMENTS
CHALCEDON
WAS
A
COMPROMISE
BETWEEN
TWO
GROUPS
THE
ALEXANDRIANS
AND
ANTIOCHENES
IT
ADOPTED
LANGUAGE
THAT
WAS
INTENDED
TO
BE
ACCEPTABLE
TO
MODERATES
IN
BOTH
CAMPS
WHILE
RULING
OUT
THE
EXTREMES
I
AGREE
THAT
THERE
WERE
EXTREMES
THAT
WERE
HERETICAL
HOWEVER
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
COMPLEX
POLITICS
OF
THE
TIME
IT
APPEARS
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
GOT
REJECTED
WHO
DIDNT
INTEND
HERESY
BUT
SIMPLY
USED
LANGUAGE
THAT
WAS
NOT
UNDERSTOOD
OR
EVEN
WAS
MISPRESENTED
AND
SOME
SEEM
NOT
TO
HAVE
JOINTED
IN
THE
COMPROMISE
FOR
REASONS
OTHER
THAN
DOCTRINE
THERE
ARE
GROUPS
DESCENDED
FROM
BOTH
OF
THE
SUPPOSEDLY
HERETICAL
CAMPS
THIS
POSTING
DISCUSSED
THE
DESCENDANTS
OF
THE
ALEXANDRIANS
THERE
ARE
ALSO
A
REMAINING
NESTORIANS
LIKE
SOME
OF
THE
CURRENT
SOCALLED
MONOPHYSITES
THERE
IS
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CURRENT
SOCALLED
NESTORIANS
ARE
NOT
HERETICAL
EITHER
THEY
SHELTERED
NESTORIUS
FROM
WHAT
THEY
SAW
AS
UNFAIR
TREATMENT
BUT
CLAIM
THEY
DID
NOT
ADOPT
HIS
HERESIES
AND
IN
FACT
SEEM
TO
FOLLOW
MORE
MODERATE
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THE
ANTIOCHENE
TRADITION
CLH
THERE
IS
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
STATUS
OF
WHAT
YOU
REFER
TO
AS
ALEXANDRIANS
ACTUALLY
THIS
INCLUDES
ALL
ORIENTAL
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
AND
NOT
ONLY
COPTS
AND
THAT
OF
NESTORIANS
THE
ORIENTAL
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
NEVER
EVEN
SHELTER
EUTYCHES
THE
ADVOCATOR
OF
MONOPHYSITISM
BUT
ON
THE
CONTRARY
IT
CONDEMNED
AND
STILL
DOES
CONDEMN
HIM
AND
HIS
HERESY
THAT
IS
WHY
THE
EASTREN
CHALCEDONIAN
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
HELD
TALKS
WITH
THE
ORIENTAL
NONCHALCEDONIAN
THAT
STARTED
YEARS
AGO
AND
STILL
CONTINUEING
TILL
TODAY
BUT
THEY
HAVE
CONVERGED
ON
MANY
ISSUES
THE
MOST
IMPORATANT
OF
WHICH
IS
CHRISTOLOGY
I
HAVE
MORE
DETAILS
OF
THE
INTERORTHODOX
DIALOGUE
IN
CASE
ANYONE
IS
INTERESTED
SO
I
DO
NOT
SEE
HOW
THE
ALEXANDRIANS
AND
THE
NESTORIANS
ARE
IN
A
SIMILAR
POSITION
PEACE
