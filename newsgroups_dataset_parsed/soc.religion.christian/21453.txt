A
FEW
DAYS
BACK
THE
BELOWINCLUDED
MESSAGE
WAS
POSTED
STATING
I
BELIEVE
WITH
EVERYTHING
IN
MY
HEART
THAT
ON
MAY
THE
CITY
OF
PORTLAND
OREGON
IN
THE
COUNTRY
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
OF
AMERICA
WILL
BE
HIT
WITH
A
CATASTROPHIC
AND
DISASTROUS
EARTHQUAKE
BY
NOW
WE
KNOW
THAT
THIS
DID
NOT
COME
TO
PASS
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
PARTICULARLY
GLORIFYING
TO
GOD
TO
SAY
THINGS
LIKE
WELL
I
THINK
THE
LORD
IS
TELLING
ME
SUCH
STATEMENTS
SEEM
TO
ME
TO
BE
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
GET
A
SPIRITUAL
THRILL
SHOULD
THE
GUESS
HAPPEN
TO
COME
TRUE
WITHOUT
RISKING
THE
GUILT
OF
FALSE
PROPHECY
SHOULD
IT
FAIL
TO
COME
TO
PASS
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
GENUINE
PROPHECY
WAS
EVER
LIKE
THIS
COMMENTS
I
AGREE
PEOPLE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
MISLED
TO
BELIEVE
THUS
SAYETH
THE
LORD
BY
INNUENDO
OR
OPINION
OR
SPECULATION
SPEAK
DIRECTLY
IF
THE
LORD
HAS
GIVEN
YOU
SOMETHING
TO
SAY
SAY
IT
BUT
BEFORE
I
DECLARE
THUS
SAYETH
THE
LORD
ID
BETTER
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
WITHOUT
A
SHADOW
OF
A
DOUBT
THAT
I
AM
IN
THE
CORRECT
SPIRITUAL
CONDITION
AND
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE
LORD
TO
RECEIVE
SUCH
A
PROPHECY
AND
BE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
AGAIN
WITHOUT
THE
TINIEST
SHADOW
OF
A
DOUBT
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
POSSIBILITY
OF
MY
BEING
MISLED
BY
MY
OWN
IMAGINATIONS
OR
BY
MY
HOPE
OF
GAINING
RECOGNITION
OR
OF
BEING
MISLED
BY
THE
WILES
OF
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
FOLLOWERS
MISTAKES
IN
THIS
AREA
ARE
COSTLY
AND
DANGEROUS
FOR
ME
MY
GREATEST
FEARS
IN
THIS
AREA
WOULD
BE
THE
FOLLOWING
THE
PEOPLE
WOULD
BE
MISLED
PEOPLE
WOULD
LOSE
RESPECT
FOR
CHRISTIANITY
TRUE
PROPHECY
WOULD
BE
CLOUDED
BY
ALL
THE
FALSE
PROPHECIES
GOD
TO
CALL
ME
TO
BE
A
PROPHET
AND
I
WERE
TO
MISREPRESENT
GODS
WORD
MY
CALLING
WOULD
BE
LOST
FOREVER
GODS
WORD
WOULD
COMMAND
THE
PEOPLE
NEVER
TO
LISTEN
TO
OR
FEAR
MY
WORDS
AS
I
WOULD
BE
A
FALSE
PROPHET
MY
BRIDGES
WOULD
BE
BURNT
FOREVER
PERHAPS
I
COULD
REPENT
AND
BE
SAVED
BUT
I
COULD
NEVER
AGAIN
BE
A
PROPHET
OF
GOD
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THIS
IT
IS
CRITICAL
THAT
WE
SPEAK
WHEN
THE
LORD
SAYS
SPEAK
AND
THAT
WE
BE
SILENT
WHEN
THE
LORD
SAYS
TO
BE
SILENT
LEST
WE
DEPRIVE
THE
WORLD
OF
GODS
WORD
AND
HIDE
IT
UNDER
A
BUSHEL
EITHER
BY
OUR
INAPPROPRIATE
COWARDLY
SILENCE
OR
BY
OUR
FALSE
STATEMENTS
AND
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
IT
IS
CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT
THAT
WE
REMAIN
CLOSE
TO
THE
LORD
IN
HIS
WORD
AND
IN
PRAYER
AND
FILLED
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
SO
THAT
WE
KNOW
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THIS
DAY
AND
AGE
SINNERS
SPOUT
OFF
THEIR
MOUTHS
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
JUDGING
ONE
ANOTHER
CLAIMING
RIGHTS
THAT
ARE
NOT
THEIRS
DENYING
RIGHTS
THAT
DO
INDEED
BELONG
TO
OTHERS
DEMANDING
EQUAL
RESPECT
FOR
ALL
THE
GODS
OF
THIS
WORLD
AND
UTTERING
EVERY
FORM
OF
FALSENESS
THAT
PROMISES
TO
MAKE
ONE
FEEL
GOOD
ITS
TIME
THAT
WE
CHRISTIANS
GIVE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
HONESTY
THAT
STANDS
OUT
IN
CONTRAST
AGAINST
THIS
BACKDROP
OF
FALSEHOOD
WHEN
WE
SAY
THUS
SAYETH
THE
LORD
IT
HAPPENS
WHEN
WE
PRAY
PRAYER
IS
ANSWERED
BECAUSE
WE
PRAYED
RIGHT
WHEN
WE
SAY
WERE
CHRISTIANS
WE
REALLY
MEAN
IT
DAN
I
DEPLORE
THE
HORRIBLE
CRIME
OF
CHILD
MURDER
WE
WANT
PREVENTION
NOT
MERELY
PUNISHMENT
WE
MUST
REACH
THE
ROOT
OF
THE
EVIL
IT
IS
PRACTICED
BY
THOSE
WHOSE
INMOST
SOULS
REVOLT
FROM
THE
DREADFUL
DEED
NO
MATER
WHAT
THE
MOTIVE
LOVE
OF
EASE
OR
A
DESIRE
TO
SAVE
FROM
SUFFERING
THE
UNBORN
INNOCENT
THE
WOMAN
IS
AWFULLY
GUILTY
WHO
COMMITS
THE
DEED
BUT
OH
THRICE
GUILTY
IS
HE
WHO
DROVE
HER
TO
THE
DESPERATION
WHICH
IMPELLED
HER
TO
THE
CRIME
