WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
GERRY
PALO
WRITES
NOTE
THAT
IN
THIS
PERHAPS
THE
OLDEST
OF
THE
CREEDS
THERE
IS
NO
MENTION
OF
THE
DANGER
OF
HELL
FOR
NONBELIEVERS
LIKEWISE
THERE
IS
NO
MENTION
OF
THE
SALVATION
OF
THE
BELIEVERS
SOUL
AND
ITS
DESTINY
IN
HEAVEN
AFTER
DEATH
THERE
IS
ONLY
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
BODY
AND
IT
DOES
NOT
SAY
WHEN
OR
HOW
YOU
DONT
GO
FAR
ENOUGH
BACK
IF
WE
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
AND
THAT
HE
DID
CREATE
THE
HEAVENS
AND
THE
EARTH
AND
HE
DID
CREATE
ADAM
AND
EVE
AND
THAT
THEY
WALKED
IN
THE
GARDEN
AND
HISTORY
FLOWED
FROM
THERE
IF
WE
CAN
AGREE
WITH
THAT
THEN
WOULD
YOU
AGREE
THAT
THE
FURTHER
BACK
YOU
GO
THE
CLOSER
YOU
GET
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
A
STRONGER
MEMORY
OF
WHO
GOD
WAS
AND
WHAT
HE
SAID
AND
COMMANDED
BETWEEN
ADAM
AND
EVE
AND
GOLGOTHA
THE
WHOLE
PROCESS
OF
THE
FALL
OF
MAN
OCCURRED
THIS
INVOLVED
A
GRADUAL
DIMMING
OF
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
THIS
IS
DISCERNABLE
IN
THE
WORLD
OUTLOOKS
OF
DIFFERENT
PEOPLES
THROUGH
HISTORY
THE
GREEK
FOR
EXAMPLE
COULD
SAY
BETTER
A
BEGGAR
IN
THE
LAND
OF
THE
LIVING
THAN
A
KING
IN
THE
LAND
OF
THE
DEAD
ILIAD
I
THINK
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
HUMAN
BEINGS
WHO
DIED
BEFORE
CHRIST
IS
AN
EVER
PRESENT
ONE
WITH
CHRISTIANS
I
AM
NOT
READY
TO
CONSCIGN
ADAM
OR
ABRAHAM
OR
EVEN
CAIN
TO
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
YET
THEY
ALL
DIED
IN
THEIR
SINS
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
SENSE
THE
SAME
CAN
BE
SAID
OF
THE
WHOLE
OF
GENTILE
HUMANITY
AND
ALSO
OF
THE
UNREPENTANT
MALEFACTOR
ON
THE
CROSS
NEXT
TO
HIM
I
DO
NOT
LIMIT
THE
POWER
OF
CHRIST
TO
SAVE
EVEN
HIM
THROUGH
WHOM
SATAN
WOULD
MOCK
HIS
DEED
OF
SALVATION
AT
THE
VERY
MOMENT
OF
ITS
FULFILLMENT
IN
MY
STUDIES
OF
THE
ANCIENT
MYSTERY
RELIEGIONS
I
HAVE
RUN
ACROSS
MANY
POEMS
OR
RITUALS
OR
WHAT
NOTS
WITH
THE
INTERPRETATION
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ARE
OF
GOD
WILL
BE
WITH
HIM
VIA
THE
PROMISED
SEED
BUT
THOSE
WHO
REBEL
WILL
SUFFER
ETERNAL
LIFE
IN
DIEING
IT
WAS
A
STANDARD
BELIEF
BACK
THEN
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
EXPERIENCE
ETERNITY
IN
A
PASSING
MOMENT
THE
RELATIONSHIP
OF
ETERNITY
TO
DURATION
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
ONE
OF
INDEFINITELY
EXTENDED
CONDITIONS
OF
GREENWICH
MEAN
TIME
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
IMAGINE
AN
ETERNITY
OF
AGONY
OR
BLISS
OR
EVEN
MANY
OF
THEM
IN
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
DURING
THE
TIME
BETWEEN
EARTHLY
DEATH
AND
A
NEW
BIRTH
IT
WAS
ALSO
A
STANDARD
BELIEF
AMONG
MANY
PEOPLES
THAT
EVEN
THE
RIGHTEOUS
WERE
LOST
THIS
AGAIN
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
LOSS
OF
THE
PARADISAL
CONSCIOUSNESS
THAT
FLED
FROM
US
AFTER
THE
FALL
WITH
OUR
EVER
INCREASING
INVOLVEMENT
WITH
THE
SENSE
WORLD
IT
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
TO
SHARE
IN
THE
RESULTS
OF
YOUR
STUDIES
OF
ANCIENT
PEOPLES
IDEAS
OF
LIFE
AFTER
DEATH
TODAY
WE
THINK
WE
KNOW
SO
MUCH
AND
THAT
IF
WE
COULD
GO
BACK
IN
TIME
WE
COULD
SURE
TEACH
THOSE
PEOPLE
A
THING
OR
TWO
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
AS
THIS
AGE
HAS
GROWN
OLDER
THAT
IT
IS
WE
WHO
OPPERATE
FROM
A
MIST
NOT
THOSE
OF
THE
OLDER
AGES
MANKIND
FELL
INTO
MIST
AND
DARKNESS
AND
AT
THE
TURNING
POINT
OF
TIME
A
NEW
LIGHT
ENTERED
INTO
THE
WORLD
THE
LIGHT
STILL
GROWS
AND
WE
ARE
DEVELOPING
THE
EYES
WITH
WHICH
TO
SEE
BY
IT
MUCH
NEW
REVELATION
AND
GROWTH
IN
UNDER
STANDING
LIES
BEFORE
US
OUR
NEW
VISION
AND
UNDERSTANDING
IS
STILL
VERY
FEEBLE
BUT
IT
CONTAINS
SOMETHING
NEW
THAT
WILL
GROW
IN
TIME
TO
EMBRACE
THAT
WHICH
IS
OLD
AND
MUCH
MORE
AS
WELL
AT
THIS
POINT
I
SHOULD
ACKNOWLEDGE
OPENLY
MY
DEBT
TO
THE
WORK
OF
RUDOLF
STEINER
FOUNDER
OF
ANTHROPOSOPHY
FOR
MANY
INSIGHTS
THAT
HAVE
LED
ME
TO
MY
VIEWS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
I
HAVE
SAID
IT
BEFORE
ID
LOVE
TO
POST
ON
THIS
BUT
THE
VULCAN
HAMMER
WOULD
FALL
THE
HISTORY
TO
PURGATORY
CAN
BE
SHOWN
FROM
THE
DRUIDS
IN
ENGLAND
TO
THE
GREEKS
WHO
PILAGED
IT
FROM
THE
EGYPTIANS
WHO
ULTIMATELY
GOT
IT
FROM
THE
BABYLONIAN
MYSTERIES
AND
YES
THE
EASTERN
RELIGIONS
ALSO
SHOW
MANY
SIMILARITIES
I
MEAN
ITS
BLACK
AND
WHITE
THE
WRITINGS
AND
THE
ARCHEOLOGICAL
FINDS
PLAINLY
SHOW
ITS
ORIGIN
AND
THE
WHYS
AND
WHEREFORES
OF
THIS
DOCTINE
THE
WAY
YOU
REFER
TO
IT
AS
DOCTRINE
PUTS
A
MODERN
INTELLECTUAL
COLORING
ON
IT
I
THINK
IT
WAS
MUCH
LESS
ABSTRACT
AND
MUCH
MORE
REAL
AND
SPIRITUALLY
CONCRETE
A
TEACHING
THAT
STRUCK
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
HOME
THAN
OUR
DOCTRINES
OR
TEACHINGS
TODAY
CAN
BE
RECEIVED
I
AM
NOT
SO
READY
TO
ATTRIBUTE
WIDESPREAD
NOTIONS
IN
ANTIQUITY
TO
SIMPLE
DISPERSION
FROM
AN
ORIGINAL
SOURCE
EVEN
IF
THEY
WERE
PASSED
ON
THE
QUESTION
IS
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
DID
THEY
REFLECT
REAL
PERCEPTION
AND
EXPERIENCE
THE
SIMILARITY
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
GREAT
VARIETY
OF
EXPRESSION
OF
THE
DIFFERENT
PEOPLES
IDEAS
OF
THE
TIME
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
DEATH
TESTIFIES
TO
THE
PRESENCE
OF
AN
UNDERLYING
REALITY
IN
ANY
CASE
WE
STUDY
GEOMETRY
NOT
BY
READING
OLD
MANUSCRIPTS
OF
EUCLID
BUT
BY
CONTEMPLATING
THE
PRINCIPLES
THEMSELVES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THERE
IS
ONE
NOTION
FIRMLY
EMBEDDED
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
ORIGINATED
MOST
DEFINITELY
IN
A
PAGAN
SOURCE
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
HUMAN
BEING
CONSISTS
ESSENTIALLY
OF
SOUL
ONLY
AND
THAT
THE
SOUL
IS
CREATED
AT
BIRTH
WAS
CONSCIOUSLY
ADOPTED
FROM
ARISTOTLE
WHOSE
IDEAS
DOMINATED
CHRISTIAN
THOUGHT
FOR
FIFTEEN
HUNDRED
YEARS
AND
STILL
DOES
TODAY
HE
WAS
AT
ONCE
THE
FATHER
OF
MODERN
THOUGHT
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
LIVED
DURING
THAT
DARKENED
TIME
WHEN
THE
PERCEPTION
OF
OUR
ETERNAL
SPIRITUAL
BEING
HAD
GROWN
DIM
MAYBE
AT
SOMETIME
IN
THE
FUTURE
INDEED
I
SHOULD
ALSO
CLARIFY
THAT
I
DO
NOT
DENY
THAT
ETERNAL
IRREVOCABLE
DAMNATION
IS
A
REAL
POSSIBILITY
BUT
THE
NARROW
RANGE
IN
WHICH
WE
CONCEIVE
OF
THE
DECISIVE
MOMENT
IE
AFTER
THE
END
OF
A
SINGLE
EARTHLY
LIFE
IS
NOT
IN
MY
MIND
SUFFICIENT
TO
EMBRACE
THE
REALITY
AND
I
THINK
THAT
IS
WHY
THE
EARLY
CREEDS
WERE
COUCHED
IN
TERMS
THAT
DID
NOT
TRY
TO
SPELL
IT
OUT
