moral
question
jen

asked
is
it
okay
to
create
a
child
if
you
arent
able
to
be
a
good
parent
i
am
reminded
of
a
speech
by
one
of
the
characters
i
cant
remember
which
in
the
movie
parenthood
i
am
way
to
liberal
with
my
quotation
marks
tonight
in
this
socalled
by
me
speech
the
character
is
expressing
what
a
lousy
father
he
had
and
he
made
an
interesting
point
he
said
something
to
the
effect
of
you
have
to
have
a
license
to
drive
a
car
you
have
to
have
a
license
to
own
a
dog
you
even
have
to
have
a
license
to
fish
but
theyll
anyone
have
a
kid
keep
in
mind
that
i
am
in
no
way
trying
to
pass
this
off
as
a
quote
it
is
probably
grossly
distorted
but
i
think
you
get
the
point
