FORMERLY
RE
QUESTION
ABOUT
VIRGIN
MARY
MARK
ASHLEYS
ACCOUNT
OF
PRIVATE
REVELATION
DOES
NOT
AS
SOME
MIGHT
THINK
CONTRADICT
MY
POSTING
IN
WHICH
I
SAID
THAT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
BELIEVES
THAT
PUBLIC
REVELATION
ON
WHICH
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
IS
BASED
ENDED
WITH
THE
DEATH
OF
ST
JOHN
THE
LAST
APOSTLE
IN
THAT
POSTING
I
MADE
SURE
I
USED
THE
WORD
PUBLIC
PUBLIC
REVELATION
CONTAINS
GODS
TRUTH
INTENDED
FOR
EVERYONE
TO
BELIEVE
THE
REVELATION
CONTAINED
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
SUBSET
OF
PUBLIC
REVELATION
PRIVATE
REVELATION
IS
REVELATION
THAT
GOD
GIVES
TO
AN
INDIVIDUAL
HE
MAY
SPEAK
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
INDIVIDUAL
HE
MAY
SEND
AN
ANGEL
OR
HE
MAY
SEND
THE
VIRGIN
MARY
OR
SOME
LESSER
SAINT
THE
ONLY
PERSON
WHO
IS
REQUIRED
TO
BELIEVE
A
PRIVATE
REVELATION
IS
THE
PERSON
TO
WHOM
IT
IS
REVEALED
DEVOTIONAL
PRACTICES
MAY
BE
BASED
ON
REPORTED
PRIVATE
REVELATIONS
BUT
DOCTRINES
CAN
NOT
WHEN
AN
ALLEGED
PRIVATE
REVELATION
ATTRACTS
SUFFICIENT
ATTENTION
THE
CHURCH
MAY
INVESTIGATE
IT
IF
THE
INVESTIGATION
INDICATES
A
LIKELIHOOD
THAT
THE
ALLEGED
PRIVATE
REVELATION
IS
IN
FACT
FROM
GOD
IT
WILL
BE
APPROVED
THAT
MEANS
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
PREACHED
IN
THE
CHURCH
HOWEVER
IT
IS
STILL
TRUE
THAT
NO
ONE
IS
REQUIRED
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
CAME
FROM
GOD
A
CATHOLIC
IS
FREE
TO
DENY
THE
AUTHENTICITY
OF
EVEN
THE
MOST
WELL
ATTESTED
AND
STRONGLY
APPROVED
PRIVATE
REVELATIONS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
AT
FATIMA
AND
LOURDES
I
SUSPECT
THAT
FEW
IF
ANY
CATHOLICS
DO
REJECT
FATIMA
AND
LOURDES
BUT
IF
ANY
DO
THEIR
REJECTION
OF
THEM
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THEY
ARE
NOT
ORTHODOX
CATHOLICS
IN
GOOD
STANDING
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
AT
HAND
A
LIST
OF
THE
CRITERIA
THE
CHURCH
USES
IN
EVALUATING
AN
ALLEGED
PRIVATE
REVELATIONITS
NOT
SOMETHING
I
NEED
EVERY
DAYBUT
I
KNOW
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
PRIMARY
REQUIREMENTS
IS
THAT
NOTHING
IN
THE
ALLEGED
PRIVATE
REVELATION
CAN
CONTRADICT
