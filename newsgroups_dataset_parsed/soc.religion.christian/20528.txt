RE
CHRISTIANS
AND
AIDS
PAUL
CONDITT
WRITES
YES
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
REALIZE
THAT
ALL
ACTIONS
HAVE
CONSEQUENCES
AND
THAT
RULES
WERE
MADE
FOR
OUR
OWN
GOOD
BUT
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
A
DISEASE
IS
A
PUNISHMENT
FOR
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
SIN
I
THINK
IS
TAKING
THINGS
MUCH
TOO
FAR
TEXT
DELETED
YES
SIN
CAN
HAVE
TERRIBLE
CONSEQUENCES
BUT
WE
NEED
TO
BE
REAL
CAREFUL
WHEN
SAYING
THAT
THE
CONSEQUENCES
ARE
A
PUNISHMENT
FOR
SIN
I
WISH
THAT
YOU
HAD
FOLLOWED
THIS
THREAD
BEFORE
JUMPING
TO
CONCLUSIONS
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANYBODY
WRITE
THAT
AIDS
WAS
A
PUNISHMENT
FOR
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
SIN
THIS
INCLUDES
MARK
ASHLEY
WHO
YOU
WERE
RESPONDING
TO
HERE
I
MYSELF
WROTE
THAT
WHEN
YOU
DONT
DO
THINGS
GODS
WAY
THAT
CURSES
WILL
COME
ON
YOU
AND
OTHERS
ALTHOUGH
ONE
DEFINITION
OF
CURSE
IS
RETRIBUTION
I
ONLY
MEANT
HARM
OR
MISFORTUNE
WHEN
I
USED
THE
WORD
BECAUSE
GOD
LOVES
US
HE
HAS
TOLD
US
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
LIVE
IN
HIS
BIBLE
GOD
DOESNT
CAUSE
CURSES
HE
WARNS
US
OF
THEM
KEVIN
DAVIS
WROTE
A
WHILE
AGO
LAST
WEEK
I
WAS
GUILTY
OF
ANGER
JEALOUSY
AND
WHOLE
MESS
OF
OTHER
STUFF
YET
I
AM
FORGIVEN
AND
NOT
CONDEMNED
TO
SUFFER
WITH
AIDS
TO
EVEN
SUGGEST
THAT
AIDS
IS
DESERVED
IS
LUDICROUS
THE
BIBLE
MAKES
IT
CLEAR
THAT
WE
ALL
EQUALLY
DESERVE
DEATH
WHICH
IS
MUCH
WORSE
THAN
AIDS
WE
HAVE
ALL
HURT
GOD
WITH
OUR
SIN
PAUL
CONDITT
REVEALS
HIS
FEELINGS
IN
CASE
YOU
COULDNT
TELL
I
GET
EXTREMELY
ANGRY
AND
UPSET
WHEN
I
SEE
THINGS
LIKE
THIS
INSTEAD
OF
RATIONALIZING
OUR
OWN
FEARS
AND
PHOBIAS
WE
NEED
TO
BE
REACHING
OUT
TO
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
AND
OTHER
SOCIALLY
UNACCEPTABLE
DISEASES
WHETHER
THEY
GOT
THE
DISEASE
THROUGH
THEIR
OWN
ACTIONS
OR
NOT
IS
IRRELEVANT
THEY
STILL
NEED
JESUS
THE
FIRST
ISSUE
YOU
BRING
UP
IS
YOUR
ANGER
IT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
WRONG
TO
BE
ANGRY
GAL
FOR
ANY
REASON
ESPECIALLY
EXTREMELY
ANGRY
WHICH
IS
ON
PAR
WITH
HATRED
JESUS
HAS
EVERY
REASON
TO
BE
ANGRY
AT
US
FOR
PUTTING
HIM
ON
THE
CROSS
WITH
OUR
SIN
YET
HIS
PRAYER
WAS
FORGIVE
THEM
FATHER
THEY
KNOW
NOT
WHAT
THEY
DO
KNOWING
HOW
FORGIVING
JESUS
HAS
BEEN
WITH
ME
CALLS
ME
TO
BE
MORE
FORGIVING
WITH
EVERYONE
OUT
OF
LOVE
FOR
HIM
PLEASE
DONT
GIVE
IN
TO
ANGER
IT
WILL
ONLY
CAUSE
FOOLISH
QUARRELS
AND
MORE
BAD
FEELINGS
ITS
OKAY
IF
YOU
READ
SOMETHING
THAT
BOTHERS
YOU
BUT
YOU
NEED
TO
ADDRESS
IT
IN
A
LOVING
WAY
IF
RIGHT
NOW
I
FELT
LIKE
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
WAS
SAYING
THAT
GOD
PUNISHES
GAY
OR
SEXUALLY
IMMORAL
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
BECAUSE
THEY
DESERVE
PUNISHMENT
THAT
OTHERS
DONT
THEN
I
WOULD
FRAME
A
RESPONSE
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
IT
MAKES
ME
FEEL
VERY
SAD
FOR
SOMEONE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
AIDS
WHICH
IS
SIMPLY
A
HARMFUL
DISEASE
NOT
SO
UNLIKE
ANY
OTHER
IS
GODS
PUNISHMENT
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
COMMITTED
CERTAIN
SINS
GOD
LOVES
ALL
OF
HIS
CHILDREN
EQUALLY
AND
REJOICES
WHEN
A
SINGLE
ONE
COMES
BACK
TO
HIM
WE
WILL
ALL
BE
JUDGED
AFTER
WE
DIE
BUT
UNTIL
THEN
WE
ALL
HAVE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
ACCEPT
GODS
GRACE
BY
EARNESTLY
SEEKING
AFTER
HIM
WITH
ALL
OF
OUR
HEARTS
BELIEVING
THE
GOSPELS
TESTIMONY
REPENTING
OF
OUR
SIN
CONFESSING
THAT
JESUS
IS
LORD
AT
BAPTISM
AND
LIVING
A
NEW
LIFE
FOR
HIM
LET
US
NOT
JUDGE
SOMEONE
TO
BE
ETERNALLY
CONDEMNED
GODS
ARM
IS
NOT
TO
SHORT
TO
SAVE
HE
WILL
DO
ANYTHING
HE
CAN
TO
MOVE
A
HARDENED
HEART
OR
A
MISLED
PERSON
HE
WORKS
FOR
THE
GOOD
OF
ALL
MEN
EVEN
THROUGH
THE
WORST
OF
SITUATIONS
HE
HAS
SET
THE
TIMES
AND
PLACES
FOR
ALL
MEN
THAT
THEY
MAY
PERHAPS
REACH
OUT
AND
FIND
HIM
THE
SECOND
ISSUE
YOU
BRING
UP
IS
SEEING
PEOPLE
RATIONALIZE
THEIR
FEARS
OF
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
FORTUNATELY
WHAT
YOU
DESCRIBE
AS
SEEING
IS
ACTUALLY
MISPERCEIVING
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
MISSING
THE
POINTS
MADE
IN
THE
EARLIER
POSTS
AND
REACTING
IN
ANGER
TO
ATTITUDES
THAT
HAVENT
BEEN
EXPRESSED
I
KNOW
THAT
ITS
SOMETIMES
HARD
TO
DISCOUNT
YOUR
PERCEPTIONS
BUT
PLEASE
TRY
TO
BE
OPENMINDED
YOU
ARE
QUITE
CORRECT
IN
SAYING
THAT
WE
SHOULD
REACH
OUT
TO
ALL
PEOPLE
BECAUSE
THEY
ALL
NEED
JESUS
THIS
IS
WHAT
MY
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
AND
I
DO
ON
A
DAILY
BASIS
IF
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEND
ME
THE
NAME
OF
THE
CITY
AND
STATE
YOU
LIVE
IN
I
WILL
FIND
AND
GET
YOU
IN
TOUCH
WITH
SOME
BROTHERS
WHO
HAVE
AIDS
OR
KNOW
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
AND
LIVE
NEARBY
YOU
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
SEE
THE
LOVING
ATTITUDES
FOR
YOURSELF
THE
THIRD
ISSUE
YOU
BRING
UP
IS
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
HOW
SOME
INDIVIDUAL
CONTRACTED
AIDS
HOW
SOMEONE
GETS
AIDS
IS
ONLY
RELEVANT
TO
THEIR
SALVATION
IN
THAT
THERE
MAY
BE
REPETENCE
INVOLVED
THE
IMPORTANT
POINT
TO
BE
MADE
HOWEVER
IS
THAT
NOT
LISTENING
TO
GODS
COMMANDS
OR
ADVICE
OR
WARNINGS
IE
SINNING
CAUSES
HARM
OR
MISFORTUNE
TO
YOURSELF
AND
OTHERS
FOR
THIS
REASON
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
PREVENT
THE
MISFORTUNE
OF
AIDS
WHICH
CAN
BE
TRANSMITTED
IN
SINFUL
WAYS
IS
TO
LISTEN
TO
GODS
ADVICE
AND
HAVE
SEX
ONLY
WITH
YOUR
WIFE
OR
HUSBAND
I
HOPE
THAT
YOU
ARE
FEELING
BETTER
NOW
PAUL
LOVE
