JAMES

MORE
RECENTLY
WRIGHTS
UNDERSTANDING
HAS
ITSELF
BEEN
QUESTIONED
FROM
A
DIFFERENT
DIRECTION
IN
A
BRIEF
STUDY
WILLIAM
PETERSEN
FOUND
LINGUISTIC
CONFUSION
IN
USING
THE
ENGLISH
WORD
HOMOSEXUALS
AS
THE
MEANING
OF
HE
FAULTED
WRIGHT

ENGLISH
BIBLE
TRANSLAIONS
FOR
RENDERING
IT
BY

IN
I
COR
AND
I
TIM
IN
A

PETERSEN
HAS
COALESCED
BAILEY
BOSWELL
AND
SCROGGS
INTO
A
SINGLE
ASSERTION
THAT
REITERATES
IN
EFFECT
THE
POSITION
OF
BAILEY
HE
FINDS
HOMOSEXUALS
UNACCEPTABLE
AS
A
TRANSLATION
BECAUSE
IT
IS
ANACHRONISTIC
A
MAJOR
DISJUNCTION
EXISTS
BETWEEN
CONTEMPORARY
THOUGHT
AND
TERMINOLOGY
AND
THE
THOUGHT
AND
TERMINOLGY
IN
PAULS
TIME
WHAT
IS
THIS
DISJUNCTION
HE
BASES
IT
ON
HISTORICAL
AND
LINGUISTIC
FACTS
ACCORDINGLY
ANCIENT
GREEK
AND
ROMAN
SOCIETY
TREATED
MALE
SEXUALITY
AS
POLYVALENT
AND
CHARACTERIZED
A
PERSON
SEXUALLY
ONLY
BY
HIS
SEXUAL
ACTS
VIRTUALLY
ALL
FORMS
OF
BEHAVIOR
EXCEPT
TRANSVESTISM
WERE
ACCEPTABLE
CHRISTIANITY
SIMPLY
ADDED
THE
CATEGORIES
OF
NATURAL
AND
UNNATURAL
IN
DESCRIBING
THESE
ACTIONS
ANCIENT
SOCIETY
KNOW
NOTHING
OF
THE
CATEGORIES
OF
HOMOSEXUALS
AND
HETEROSEXUALS
AND
ASSUMED
THAT
IN
THE
WORDS
OF
DOVER
QUOTED
APPROVINGLY
BY
PETERSEN
EVERYONE
RESPONDS
AT
DIFFERENT
TIMES
TO
BOTH
HOMOSEXUAL
AND
TO
HETEROSEXUAL
STIMULI
IN
CONTRAST
TO
THIS
MODERN
USAGE
VIRTUALLY
LIMITS
THE

HOMOSEXUAL
TO
DESIRE
AND

KM
BENKERT
WHO
IN
COINED
THE
GERMAN

EQUIVALENT

HAVING
NOTHING

ACTS
PETERSEN
THEN
PROCEEDS
TO
CITE
THE
SUPPLEMENT
TO
THE
OXFORD
ENGLISH
DICTIONARY
WHICH
DEFINES
HOMOSEXUAL
ONLY
AS
A
PROPENSITY
OR
DESIRE
WITH
NO
MENTION
OF

PETERSENS
POINT
IS
THAT
BY
USING
HOMOSEXUALS
FOR
ARSENOKOITAI
ONE
WRONGFULLY
READS
A
MODERN
CONCEPT
BACK
INTO
EARLY
HISTORY
WHERE
NO
EQUIVALENT
CONCEPT
EXISTED
CONSEQUENTLY
THE
TRANSLATION
IS
INACCURATE
BECAUSE
IT
INCLUDES
CELIBATE
HOMOPHILES
INCORRECTLY
EXLUDES
HETEROSEXUALS
WHO
ENGAGE
IN
HOMOSEXUAL
ACTS
ANDINCORRECTLY
INCLUDES
FEMALE
HOMOSEXUALS
PRIOR

THERE
WAS
NO
COGNITIVE
STRUCTURE
EITHER
INOUR
SOCIETY
OR
IN

WITHIN
WHICH
THE
MODERN
BIFURCATION
OF
HUMANITY
INTO
HOMOSEXUALS
AND
HETERSOSEXUALS
MADE
SENCE
THE
FOREGOING
CLARIFIES
WHY
PETERSEN
FEELS
THAT
THE
TRANSLATIO
HOMOSEXUAL
IS
MISTAKEN
YET
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
PETERSEN
IS
THE
ONE
MISTAKEN
ON
BOTH
HISTORICAL
AND
LINGUISTIC
OR
PHILOLOGICAL
GROUNDS
THE
NEXT
PHASES
OF
THIS
PAPER
WILL
CRITICALLY
EXAMINE
PETERSENS
POSITION
THE
JUSTIFICATION
FOR

ARSENOKOITAI
BY

HISTORICAL
GROUNDS
A
REFUTATION
OF
THE
FOREGOING
OPPOSITION
TO
THE
TRASLATION
OF
ARSENOKOITAI
BY
HOMOSEXUALS
BEGINS
WITH
THE
HISTORICAL
AND
CULTURAL
EVIDENCE
SINCE
VIRTUALLY
EVERYONE
ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT
THE
WORD
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
BEFORE
PAULS
USAGE
NO
HISTORICAL

EARLIER

ARE

YET
MUCH
WRITING
REVEALS
THAT
ANCIENT

THE
GOAL
IS
TO

WHEITHER

CONCEIVED
OF

IN

HOWEVER
THIS

HARDLY

THEN

EACH
OF

THEN

A

SINCE
EVERY

THE

OF

BEEN

IN

AND
EACH
IS

SEARCHING
FOR
THE

THAT

ALL
THE
MEN
WHO
ARE

OF
THAT
COMPOSITE

THAT

OUR

OF

SHAMELESS
CREATURES
BUT
FALSELY
FOR
THEIR

IS
DUE
NOT
TO
SHAMELESSNESS
BUT
TO
DARING
MANLINESS
AND
VIRILITY
SINCE
THEY
ARE
QUICK
TO

SURE
EVIDENCE
OF
THIS
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
ON
REACHING

THESE
ALONE
PROVE

SO
WHEN
THEY

THEY

AND
HAVE
NO

UNDER

THEY
ARE
QUITE

A

OF

IS
AT

THE

WONDROUSLY

ARE

EACH

FOR

THESE
ARE
THEY

THROUGHOUT
