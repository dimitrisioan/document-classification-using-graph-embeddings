james
b
deyoung
w
petersen
more
recently
wrights
understanding
has
itself
been
questioned
from
a
different
direction
in
a
brief
study
william
petersen
found
linguistic
confusion
in
using
the
english
word
homosexuals
as
the
meaning
of
he
faulted
wright
and
english
bible
translaions
for
rendering
it
by
homosexuals
in
i
cor
and
i
tim
in
a
sense
petersen
has
coalesced
bailey
boswell
and
scroggs
into
a
single
assertion
that
reiterates
in
effect
the
position
of
bailey
he
finds
homosexuals
unacceptable
as
a
translation
because
it
is
anachronistic
a
major
disjunction
exists
between
contemporary
thought
and
terminology
and
the
thought
and
terminolgy
in
pauls
time
what
is
this
disjunction
he
bases
it
on
historical
and
linguistic
facts
accordingly
ancient
greek
and
roman
society
treated
male
sexuality
as
polyvalent
and
characterized
a
person
sexually
only
by
his
sexual
acts
virtually
all
forms
of
behavior
except
transvestism
were
acceptable
christianity
simply
added
the
categories
of
natural
and
unnatural
in
describing
these
actions
ancient
society
know
nothing
of
the
categories
of
homosexuals
and
heterosexuals
and
assumed
that
in
the
words
of
dover
quoted
approvingly
by
petersen
everyone
responds
at
different
times
to
both
homosexual
and
to
heterosexual
stimuli
in
contrast
to
this
modern
usage
virtually
limits
the
term
homosexual
to
desire
and
propensity
km
benkert
who
in
coined
the
german
term
equivalent
to
homosexual
used
it
as
referring
to
orientation
impluse
or
affectional
preference
and
having
nothing
to
do
with
sexual
acts
petersen
then
proceeds
to
cite
the
supplement
to
the
oxford
english
dictionary
which
defines
homosexual
only
as
a
propensity
or
desire
with
no
mention
of
acts
petersens
point
is
that
by
using
homosexuals
for
arsenokoitai
one
wrongfully
reads
a
modern
concept
back
into
early
history
where
no
equivalent
concept
existed
consequently
the
translation
is
inaccurate
because
it
includes
celibate
homophiles
incorrectly
exludes
heterosexuals
who
engage
in
homosexual
acts
andincorrectly
includes
female
homosexuals
prior
to
there
was
no
cognitive
structure
either
inour
society
or
in
antiquity
within
which
the
modern
bifurcation
of
humanity
into
homosexuals
and
hetersosexuals
made
sence
the
foregoing
clarifies
why
petersen
feels
that
the
translatio
homosexual
is
mistaken
yet
is
it
possible
that
petersen
is
the
one
mistaken
on
both
historical
and
linguistic
or
philological
grounds
the
next
phases
of
this
paper
will
critically
examine
petersens
position
the
justification
for
translating
arsenokoitai
by
homosexuals
historical
grounds
a
refutation
of
the
foregoing
opposition
to
the
traslation
of
arsenokoitai
by
homosexuals
begins
with
the
historical
and
cultural
evidence
since
virtually
everyone
acknowledges
that
the
word
does
not
appear
before
pauls
usage
no
historical
settings
earlier
than
his
are
available
yet
much
writing
reveals
that
ancient
understanding
of
homosexuality
prior
to
and
contemporary
with
paul
the
goal
is
to
discover
wheither
the
ancient
s
conceived
of
homosexuality
particularly
homosexual
orientation
in
a
way
similar
to
presentday
concepts
peterson
bailey
boswell
and
scroggs
claim
that
the
homosexual
condition
desire
propensity
or
inversion
whatever
it
is
called
cannot
be
part
of
the
definition
of
the
term
they
assert
this
either
because
the
term
is
limited
to
acts
of
particular
kind
boswell
active
male
prostitutes
scroggs
pederasty
or
because
the
homosexual
condition
was
unknown
in
ancient
times
bailey
petersen
the
following
discussion
will
show
why
neither
of
these
positions
is
legitimate
attention
will
be
devoted
to
the
latter
postion
first
with
the
former
one
being
addressed
below
under
linguistic
grounds
in
regard
to
the
latter
position
one
may
rightfully
ask
did
not
the
homosexual
condition
exist
before
is
it
only
a
modern
phenomenon
yet
if
it
is
universal
as
alleged
today
it
must
have
existed
always
including
ancient
times
even
though
there
is
lack
of
sophistication
in
discussing
it
indeed
evidence
show
that
the
ancients
prechristian
and
christian
not
only
knew
about
the
total
spectrum
of
sexual
behavior
including
all
forms
of
samesex
activity
transvestism
included
but
also
knoew
about
samesex
orientation
or
condition
petersen
admits
n
that
plato
in
symposium
may
be
a
sole
possible
exception
to
ancient
ingnorance
of
this
condition
he
discounts
this
however
believing
that
even
here
acts
appear
to
be
the
deciding
factor
however
this
is
a
very
significant
exception
hardly
worthy
of
being
called
an
exception
because
of
the
following
additional
evidence
for
a
homosexual
condition
the
symposium
of
plato
gives
some
of
the
strongest
evidence
for
knowledge
about
the
homosexual
condition
plato
posits
a
third
sex
comprised
of
a
mailefemale
androgynon
manwoman
hence
original
nature
palai
physis
consisted
of
three
kinds
of
human
beings
zeus
sliced
these
human
beings
in
half
to
weaken
them
so
that
they
would
not
be
a
threat
to
the
gods
consequently
each
person
seeks
his
or
her
other
half
either
one
of
the
opposite
sex
or
one
of
the
same
sex
plato
then
quotes
aristophances
each
of
us
then
is
but
a
tally
of
a
man
since
every
one
shows
like
a
flatfish
the
traces
of
having
been
sliced
in
two
and
each
is
ever
searching
for
the
tally
that
will
fit
him
all
the
men
who
are
sections
of
that
composite
sex
that
at
first
was
called
manwoman
are
womancourters
our
adulterers
are
mostly
descended
from
that
sex
whence
likewise
are
derived
our
mancourting
women
and
adulteresses
all
the
women
who
are
sections
of
the
woman
have
no
great
fancy
for
men
they
are
incllined
rather
to
women
and
of
this
stock
are
the
sheminions
men
who
are
sections
of
the
male
pursue
the
masculine
and
so
long
as
their
boyhood
lasts
they
show
themselves
to
be
sliced
of
the
male
by
making
griends
with
men
and
delighting
to
lie
with
them
and
to
be
clasped
in
mens
embrasces
these
are
the
finest
boys
and
striplings
for
they
have
the
most
manly
nature
some
say
they
are
shameless
creatures
but
falsely
for
their
behavior
is
due
not
to
shamelessness
but
to
daring
manliness
and
virility
since
they
are
quick
to
welcome
their
like
sure
evidence
of
this
is
the
fact
that
on
reaching
maturity
these
alone
prove
in
a
public
career
to
be
men
so
when
they
come
to
mans
estate
they
are
boylovers
and
have
no
natural
interest
in
wiving
and
getting
children
but
only
do
these
things
under
stress
of
custom
they
are
quite
contented
to
live
together
unwedded
all
their
days
a
man
of
this
sort
is
at
any
rate
born
to
be
a
lover
of
boys
or
the
willing
mate
of
a
man
eagerly
greeting
his
own
kind
well
when
one
of
them
whether
he
be
a
boylover
or
a
lover
of
any
other
sort
happens
on
his
own
particular
half
the
two
of
them
are
wondrously
thrilled
with
affection
and
intimacy
and
love
and
are
hardly
to
be
induced
to
leave
each
others
side
for
a
single
moment
these
are
they
who
continue
together
throughout
life
though
they
could
not
even
say
what
they
would
have
of
one
another
should
these
two
persons
be
offered
the
opportunity
to
be
fused
together
for
as
long
as
they
live
or
even
in
hades
aristophanes

that
each
would
unreservedly
deem
that
he
had

the

is
also
present
further
mention
of

to
permanecy
mutality
gay
pride
pederasty
homophobia
motive
desire
passion
and
the
nature
of
love
and
its
works
is
recognizable
clearly
the
ancients
thought
of
love
homosexual
or
other
apart
from
actions
the
speakers
in
the
symposium
argue
that
motive
in
homosexuality
is
crucial
money
office
influence
etc
bring
reproach
they
mention
the
need
to
love
the
soul
not
the
body
there
are
tow
kinds
of
love
in
the
body
and
each
has
its
desire
and
passion
the
speakers
discuss
the
principles
or
matters
of
love
the
desires
of
love
and
being
males
by
nature
noteworthy
is
the
speech
of
socrates
who
devotes
much
attention
to
explaining
how
desire
is
related
to
love
and
its
objects
desire
is
felt
for
what
is
not
provided
or
present
for
something
they
have
not
or
are
not
or
lack
this
is
the
object
of
desire
and
love
socrates
clearly
distinguishes
between
what
sort
of
being
is
love
and
the
works
of
love
this
ancient
philosopher
could
think
of
both
realms
seaual
acts
as
well
as
disposition
of
being
or
nature
his
wors
have
significance
for
more
than
pederasty
in
summary
virtually
every
element
in
the
modern
discussion
of
love
and
homosexuality
is
anticipated
in
the
symposium
of
plato
petersen
is
in
error
when
he
claims
that
the
ancients
could
only
think
of
homosexual
acts
not
inclination
or
orientation
widespread
evidence
to
the
contray
supports
the
latter
biblical
support
for
homosexuality
inclination
in
the
contexts
where
homosexual
acts
are
discribed
adds
to
the
case
for
the
ancient
distinction
in
rom
such
phrases
as
reasoning
heart
becoming
foolish
desires
of
the
heart
and
reprobate
mind
prove
pauls
concern
for
disposition
and
inclination
along
with
the
doing
or
working
of
evil
also
see

also

lord
jesus
taught
cf

the

condition
is
as
important
as
the
outer

one
gives
rise
to
the
other
cf
mt

errs
regarding
other
particulars
too

was
accepted
by
the
ancients
it
was
practiced
among
canaaniteds
syrian
people
of
asia
minor
as
well
as
greeks
according
to
sr
driver
only
a
few
moralist
and
jewish
writers
are
on
record
as
condemning
it
for
example
seneca
moral
epistles
condemns
homosexual
exploitation
that
forces
an
adult
slave
to
dress
be
beardless
and
behave
as
a
woman
philo
also
goes
to
some
length
to
describe
the
homosexuals
of
his
day
and
their
dressing
as
women
the

his

where
he

deut
petersen
is
also
wrong
in
attributing
to
christianity
the
creating
of
the
new
labels
of
natural
and
unnatural
for
sexual
behavior
these
did
not
