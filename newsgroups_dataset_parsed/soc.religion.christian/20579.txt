RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
A

ARTICLE
DLEONARANDYBGSUEDU
PIXIE
SAYS
DO
THE
WORDS
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
MEAN
ANYTHING
TO
YOU
I
DEFY
ANY
THEIST
TO
REPLY
WELL
DESPITE
WHAT
MY
MOTHER
TOLD
ME
ABOUT
ACCEPTING
DARES
HERE
GOES
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
TAKEN
LITERALLY
IT
IS
NONSENSE
THAT
WHICH
IS
AUTHORATATIVE
IS
AUTHORATATIVE
AND
TO
SAY
I
QUESTION
TO
WORD
OF
THIS
AUTHORITY
IS
RIDICULOUS
IF
IT
IS
OPEN
TO
QUESTION
IT
ISNT
AN
AUTHORITY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IT
IS
PERFECTLY
REASONABLE
TO
QUESTION
WHETHER
SOMETHING
IS
AN
AUTHORITY
THE
CATCH
PHRASE
HERE
SHOULD
BE
AUTHENTICATE
AUTHORITY
ONCE
YOU
HAVE
AUTHENTICATED
YOUR
AUTHORITY
YOU
MUST
BELIEVE
WHAT
IT
SAYS
OR
YOU
ARE
NOT
TREATING
IT
AS
AN
AUTHORITY
THE
DIFFICULTY
IS
THAT
AUTHENTICATING
AN
AUTHORITY
IS
NOT
EASY
YOU
CAN
PERHAPS
DISCREDIT
A
CLAIM
TO
AUTHORITY
BY
SHOWING
LOGICAL
INCONSISTENCY
IN
WHAT
IT
TEACHES
OR
BY
SHOWING
THAT
IT
DOES
NOT
OBEY
ITS
OWN
RULES
OF
DISCOURSE
BUT
THE
FACT
THAT
I
CANNOT
DISCREDIT
SOMETHING
DOES
NOT
IN
INSELF
ACCREDIT
IT
NOR
DOES
THE
FACT
THAT
I
CAN
CONVINCE
MYSELF
AND
OTHER
THAT
I
HAVE
DISCREDITED
SOMETHING
NECESSARILLY
MEAN
THAT
IT
IS
FALSE
I
CANNOT
ACCREDIT
AN
AUTHORITY
BY
INDEPENDANTLY
VERIFYING
ITS
TEACHINGS
BECAUSE
IF
I
CAN
INDEPENDANTLY
VERIFY
ITS
TEACHINGS
I
DONT
NEED
AN
AUTHORITY
I
NEED
AN
AUTHORITY
ONLY
WHEN
THERE
IS
INFORMATION
I
NEED
WHICH
I
CANNOT
GET
FOR
MYSELF
THUS
IF
I
AM
TO
AUTHENTICATE
AN
AUTHORITY
I
MUST
DO
IT
BY
SOME
MEANS
OTHER
THAN
BY
EXAMINING
ITS
TEACHINGS
IN
PRACTICAL
MATTERS
WE
ACCEPT
ALL
KINDS
OF
AUTHORITIES
BECAUSE
WE
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
REDISCOVER
FUNDAMENTAL
KNOWLEDGE
FOR
OURSELVES
EVERY
SCIENTIST
WORING
TODAY
ASSUMES
ON
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
SCINTIFIC
COMMUNITY
ALL
SORTS
OF
KNOWLEDGE
WHICH
IS
NECESSARY
TO
HIS
WORK
BUT
WHICH
HE
HAS
NOT
TIME
TO
VERIFY
FOR
HIMSELF
IN
SPIRITUAL
MATTERS
WE
ACCEPT
AUTHORITY
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
NO
DIRECT
SOURCE
OFINFORMATION
WE
SELECT
OUR
AUTHORITIES
BASED
ON
VARIOUS
CRITERIA
I
AM
A
CATHOLIC
IN
PART
BECAUSE
THE
HISTORICAL
CLAIMS
OF
THE
RC
CHURCH
SEEM
THE
STRONGEST
WITHOUT
AUTHORITIES
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
SUBJECT
MATTER
FOR
BELIEF
UNLESS
WE
SIMPLY
MADE
SOMETHING
UP
FOR
OURSELVES
AS
MANY
DO
THE
ATHEIST
POSITION
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
AUTHORITIES
THIS
IS
A
REASONABLE
ASSERTION
IN
ITSELF
BUT
IT
LEADS
TO
A
PRACTICAL
DIFFICULTY
IF
YOU
REJECT
ALL
AUTHORITY
OUT
OF
HAND
YOU
REJECT
ALL
POSSIBILITY
OF
EVERY
RECEIVING
INFORMATION
THUS
THE
ATHEIST
POSITION
CAN
NEVER
POSSIBLY
CHANGE
IT
IS
NONFALSIFIABLE
AND
THEREFORE
UNSCINTIFIC
TO
DEMAND
SCINTIFIC
OR
RATIONAL
PROOF
OF
GODS
EXISTENCE
IS
TO
DENY
GODS
EXISTENCE
SINCE
NEITHER
SCIENCE
NOR
REASON
CAN
IN
THEIR
VERY
NATURE
PROVE
ANYTHING
MARK
BAKER
THE
TASK
IS
NOT
TO
CUT
DOWN
JUNGLES
BUT
TO
IRRIGATE
DESERTS
