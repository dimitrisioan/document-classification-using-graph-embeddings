RE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
ESP
SIRACH
MICHAEL
SIEMON
WRITES
FURTHERMORE
IT
IS
INACCURATE
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
REFORMERS
THREW
OUT
THESE
BOOKS
BASICALLY
THEY
JUST
PLACED
THEM
IN
A
SECONDARY
STATUS
AS
JEROME
HAD
ALREADY
DONE
BUT
WITH
THE
ADDITIONAL
WARNING
THAT
DOCTRINE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
BASED
ON
CITATIONS
FROM
THESE
ALONE
PROTESTANTS
LOVE
TO
PLAY
UP
JEROME
FOR
ALL
HE
IS
WORTH
THEY
SHOULD
REMEBER
THAT
AFTER
THE
DECREE
OF
POPE
ST
DAMSUS
I
JEROME
DID
NOT
HESITATE
IN
ACCPETING
THE
DEUTERONCANON
AND
QUOTED
THEM
AS
SCRIPTURE
IN
HIS
LATER
WRITINGS
AND
AS
I
HAVE
ALREADY
POINTED
OUT
IN
A
PREVIOUS
LETTER
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
HAS
ACCEPTED
THE
DEUTEROCANON
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
AND
THE
PROTESTANTS
IN
THE
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN
REVIVED
THE
OLD
THEORY
OF
SOME
CONDEMNED
BY
POPE
COUNCIL
AND
CHURCH
THAT
THE
DEUTEROCANON
WERE
NOT
INSPIRED
AGAIN
WHY
MUST
THE
CHURCH
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
ADOPT
THE
CANON
OF
THE
UNBELIEVING
JEWS
DRAWN
UP
IN
JAMNIA
IN
AD
IN
COUNTERING
THE
CHRISTIAN
USE
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
ANDY
BYLER
