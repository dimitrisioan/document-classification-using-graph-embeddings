THE
NICENE
CREED
WAS
RE
MAJOR
VIEWS
OF
THE
TRINITY
MICHAEL
BUSHNELL
WRITES
THE
SOCALLED
CREED
OF
ATHANASIUS
HOWEVER
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
A
WESTERN
CREED
AND
HAS
ALWAYS
HAD
THE
FILIOQUE
THE
ORTHODOX
HAVE
SAID
THAT
THEY
ACCEPT
ALL
THAT
IT
SAYS
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
THE
FILIOQUE
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
IN
USE
WHICH
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
POINTED
OUT
THOUGH
I
WAS
WRONG
ABOUT
YOUR
USE
OF
THE
CREED
THE
CATHOLIC
ENCYLCOPEDIA
IN
WHICH
I
READ
ABOUT
IT
SAID
THE
ORTHODOX
DO
USE
THE
CREED
MINUS
THE
FILIOQUE
APPARENTLY
THAT
HAS
CHANGED
THE
ATHANASIAN
CREED
HAS
ALWAYS
HAD
THE
FILIOQUE
THE
NICENE
CONSTANTINOPOLITAN
DID
NOT
OF
COURSE
THE
ORTHODOX
DID
NOT
DELETE
THE
FILIOQUE
FROM
THE
NICENE
CREED
IT
WASNT
THERE
TO
BEGIN
WITH
BUT
THEY
CERTAINLY
DID
FROM
THE
ATHANASIAN
CREED
WHICH
DID
HAVE
IT
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
I
MIGHT
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
WHOLE
PROBLEM
STARTED
OVER
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
WAYS
OF
EXPLAINING
THE
GENERATION
OF
THE
BLESSED
TRINITY
THE
EAST
EMPHASIZING
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
PROCEEDING
FROM
THE
FATHER
THROUGH
THE
SON
AND
THE
WEST
USING
PROCEEDING
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
SON
IN
FACT
SOME
SUCH
AS
TERTULLIAN
USED
BOTH
FORMULATIONS
SEE
BELOW
FOLLOWING
THEREFORE
THE
FORM
OF
THESE
EXAMPLES
I
PROFESS
THAT
I
DO
CALL
GOD
AND
HIS
WORD
THE
FATHER
AND
AND
HIS
SON
TWO
FOR
THE
ROOT
AND
THE
STEM
ARE
TWO
THINGS
BUT
CONJOINED
THE
FOUNTAIN
AND
THE
RIVER
ARE
TWO
KINDS
BUT
INDIVISIBLE
THE
SUN
AND
THE
RAY
ARE
TWO
FORMS
BUT
COHERENT
ONES
ANYTHING
WHICH
PROCEEDS
FROM
ANOTHER
MUST
NECESSARILY
BE
A
SECOND
TO
THAT
FROM
WHICH
IT
PROCEEDS
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
ON
THAT
ACCOUNT
SEPARATED
FROM
IT
WHERE
THERE
IS
SECOND
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
TWO
AND
WHERE
THER
IS
THIRD
THERE
ARE
THREE
THE
SPIRIT
THEN
IS
THIRD
FROM
GOD
AND
THE
SON
JUST
AS
THE
THIRD
FROM
THE
ROOT
IS
THE
FRUIT
OF
THE
STEM
AND
THIRD
FROM
THE
FOUNTAIN
IS
THE
STREAM
FROM
THE
RIVER
AND
THRID
FROM
THE
SUN
IS
THE
APEX
OF
THE
RAY
TERTULLIAN
AGAINST
PRAXEAS
ABOUT
AD
AND
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
SPIRIT
PROCEEDS
NOT
OTHERWISE
THAN
FROM
THE
FATHER
THROUGH
THE
SON
TERTULLIAN
AGAINST
PRAXEAS
ABOUT
AD
AND
AS
ST
THOMAS
SHOWED
IN
HIS
SUMMA
THEOLOGICA
PART
QUESTION
ARTICLES
AND
THERE
IS
NO
CONTRADICTION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
METHODS
OF
GENERATION
AND
IN
FACT
THE
TWO
METHODS
OF
RECKONING
THE
PROCESSION
EMPHASIZE
WHAT
ST
AUGUSTINE
AMONG
OTHERS
TAUGHT
THAT
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
PROCEEDS
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
SON
BUT
HE
PROCEEDS
FROM
THE
FATHER
IN
A
MORE
PREEMINENT
WAY
FOR
WHATEVER
THE
SON
HAS
HE
HAS
FROM
THE
FATHER
CERTAINLY
HE
HAS
IT
FROM
THE
FATHER
THAT
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
PROCEEDS
FROM
HIM
FOR
THE
FATHER
ALONE
IS
NOT
FROM
ANOTHER
FOR
WHICH
REASON
HE
ALONE
IS
CALLED
UNBEGOTTEN
NOT
INDEED
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
BUT
IN
THE
PRACTICE
OF
THEOLOGIANS
AND
OF
THOSE
WHO
EMPLOY
SUCH
TERMS
AS
THEY
ARE
ABLE
IN
A
MATTER
SO
GREAT
THE
SON
HOWEVER
IS
BORN
OF
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
PROCEEDS
PRINCIPALLY
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
SINCE
THE
FATHER
GIVES
TO
THE
SON
ALL
THAT
HE
HAS
WITHOUT
ANY
INTERVAL
OF
TIME
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
PROCEEDS
JOINTLY
FROM
BOTH
FATHER
AND
SON
HE
WOULD
BE
CALLED
SON
OF
THE
FATHER
AND
OF
THE
SON
IF
WHICH
IS
ABHORENT
TO
EVERYONE
OF
SOUND
MIND
THEY
HAD
BOTH
BEGOTTEN
HIM
THE
SPIRIT
WAS
NOT
BEGOTTEN
BY
EACH
HOWEVER
BUT
PROCEEDS
FROM
EACH
AND
BOTH
ST
AUGUSTINE
OF
HIPPO
THE
TRINITY
TO
AD
SO
IN
A
SENSE
ALL
OF
THE
FORMULATIONS
ARE
CORRECT
TO
THE
WEST
AT
LEAST
BECAUSE
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
PROCEEDS
FROM
BOTH
FATHER
AND
SON
BUT
IN
PROCEEDING
FROM
THE
SON
THE
ORGIN
OF
THAT
PROCESSION
IS
THE
PROCESSION
FROM
THE
FATHER
SO
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IS
PROCEEDING
FROM
THE
FATHER
THROUGH
THE
SON
BUT
AS
ALL
THAT
THE
SON
HAS
IS
FROM
THE
FATHER
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
CAN
BE
SAID
TO
PROCEED
FROM
THE
FATHER
WITHOUT
ANY
MENTION
OF
THE
SON
BEING
NECESSARY
IN
ANY
CASE
I
AM
HAPPY
TO
KNOW
THAT
I
FOLLOW
IN
THE
BELIEFS
OF
POPE
ST
LEO
I
ST
FULGENCE
OF
RUSPE
ST
CYRIL
OF
ALEXANDRIA
POPE
ST
DAMSUS
I
ST
AUGUSTINE
OF
HIPPO
ST
EPIPHANIUS
OF
SALAMIS
ST
AMBROSE
OF
MILAN
ST
HILARY
OF
POITIERS
TERTULLIAN
AND
OTHERS
AMONG
THE
FATHERS
WHO
ALL
HAVE
VERY
QUOTABLE
QUOTES
SUPPORTING
THE
CATHOLIC
POSITION
WHICH
I
ENUNCIATED
ABOVE
AS
FOR
THE
ISSUE
OF
THE
ADOPTION
OF
ANOTHER
CREED
BEING
FORBIDDEN
I
WILL
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
HOLY
FATHERS
OF
EPHESUS
AND
CHALCEDON
BOTH
SPOKE
OF
THE
CREED
OF
NICEA
IN
THEIR
STATEMENT
FORBIDDING
ANYONE
TO
PRODUCE
WRITE
OR
COMPOSE
A
CONFESSION
OF
FAITH
OTHER
THAN
THE
ONE
DEFINED
BY
THE
FATHERS
OF
NICEA
THAT
CREED
IS
A
DIFFERENT
CREED
THAN
THAT
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
WHICH
IS
COMMONLY
CALLED
THE
NICENE
CREED
NOT
OF
COURSE
IN
THAT
THEY
WERE
CONDEMNING
THE
ADOPTION
OF
THE
CONSTANTINOPOLITAN
CREED
WHICH
IS
BUT
AN
ENLARGEMENT
UPON
THE
CREED
OF
NICEA
BUT
THAT
THEY
WERE
CONDEMNING
THE
IMPIOUS
OPINIONS
OF
NESTORIOUS
WHO
HAD
ADOPTED
A
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
CREED
FROM
THE
ONE
USED
BY
THE
CHURCH
WHICH
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
DENIED
THE
PROCESSION
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
FORM
THE
SON
THUS
THE
ADDITIONS
OF
THE
CONSTANTINOPOLITAN
CREED
WERE
NOT
THOUGHT
TO
BE
IN
VIOLATION
OF
THIS
AND
AS
THE
COUNCIL
CHALCEDON
ALSO
AFFIRMED
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
PROCESSION
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
FROM
THE
SON
WHICH
NESTORIUS
DENIED
THEY
COULD
HARDLY
HAVE
BEEN
AGAINST
EXPLAINING
IN
A
FULLER
WAY
THE
CREED
FOR
THEY
THEMSELVES
APPROVED
OF
PREVIOUS
ADDITIONS
TO
IT
AND
IF
THE
FURTHER
EXPLANATIONS
OF
THE
CREED
MADE
IN
CONSTANTINOPLE
WERE
NOT
DENIGRATING
OF
THE
WORK
DONE
BY
THE
HOLY
FATHERS
OF
NICEA
OR
IN
ANY
WAY
HERETICAL
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
THE
COUNCIL
OF
TOLEDO
WAS
FULLY
ABLE
TO
ADD
WHAT
WAS
NOT
DISPUTED
BY
THE
FAITHFUL
TO
THE
CREED
SO
AS
TO
COMBAT
THE
IMPIETIES
OF
THE
ARIANS
IN
SPAIN
BECAUSE
THE
FILIOQUE
WAS
NOT
IN
DISPUTE
IN
THE
CHURCH
UNTIL
MANY
YEARS
LATER
UNDER
PHOTIUS
AND
OTHERS
AND
THAT
THE
FILIOQUE
WAS
NOT
DISPUTED
I
PROVIDE
MORE
QUOTES
BELOW
SINCE
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
WHEN
HE
IS
IN
US
EFFECTS
OUR
BEING
CONFORMED
TO
GOD
AND
HE
ACTUALLY
PROCEEDS
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
SON
IT
IS
ABUNDANTLY
CLEAR
THAT
HE
IS
OF
THE
DIVINE
ESSENCE
IN
IT
IN
ESSENCE
AND
PROCEEDING
FROM
IT
ST
CYRIL
OF
ALEXANDRIA
THE
TREASURY
OF
THE
HOLY
AND
CONSUBSTANTIAL
TRINITY
THESIS
AD
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IS
NOT
OF
THE
FATHER
ONLY
OR
OF
THE
SON
ONLY
BUT
HE
IS
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
SON
FOR
IT
IS
WRITTEN
IF
ANYONE
LOVES
THE
WORLD
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
FATHER
IS
NOT
IN
HIM
AND
AGAIN
IT
IS
WRITTEN
IF
ANYONE
HOWEVER
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
SPIRIT
OF
CHRIST
HE
IS
NONE
OF
HIS
WHEN
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
SON
ARE
NAMED
IN
THIS
WAY
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IS
UNDERSTOOD
OF
WHOM
THE
SON
HIMSELF
SAYS
IN
THE
GOSPEL
THAT
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
PROCEEDS
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
THAT
HE
SHALL
RECEIVE
OF
MINE
AND
SHALL
ANNOUNCE
IT
TO
YOU
POPE
ST
DAMASUS
I
THE
DECREE
OF
DAMASUS
AD
THE
ONLYBEGOTTEN
HOLY
SPIRIT
HAS
NEITHER
THE
NAME
OF
THE
SON
NOR
THE
APPELATION
OF
FATHER
BUT
IS
CALLED
HOLY
SPIRIT
AND
IS
NOT
FOREIGN
TO
THE
FATHER
FOR
THE
ONLYBEGOTTEN
HIMSELF
CALLS
HIM
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
FATHER
AND
SAYS
OF
HIM
THE
HE
PROCEEDS
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
WILL
RECEIVE
OF
MINE
SO
THAT
HE
IS
RECKONED
AS
NOT
BEING
FOREIGN
TO
THE
SON
BUT
IS
OF
THEIR
SAME
SUBSTANCE
OF
THE
SAME
GODHEAD
HE
IS
SPIRIT
DIVINE
OF
GOD
AND
HE
IS
GOD
FOR
HE
IS
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
SPIRIT
OF
THE
FATHER
AND
SPIRIT
OF
THE
SON
NOT
BY
SOME
KIND
OF
SYNTHESIS
LIKE
SOUL
AND
BODY
IN
US
BUT
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
FATHER
AND
SON
OF
THE
FATHER
AND
OF
THE
SON
A
THIRD
BY
APPELATION
THE
FATHER
ALWAYS
EXISTED
AND
THE
SON
ALWAYS
EXISTED
AND
THE
SPIRIT
BREATHES
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
SON
AND
NEITHER
IS
THE
SON
CREATED
NOR
IS
THE
SPIRIT
CREATED
ST
EPIPHANIUS
OF
SALAMIS
WHICH
IS
ON
CYPRUS
THE
MAN
WELLANCHORED
AND
AD
CONCERNING
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
I
OUGHT
NOT
TO
REMAIN
SILENT
NOR
YET
IS
IT
NECESSARY
TO
SPEAK
STILL
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
KNOW
HIM
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
ME
TO
BE
SILENT
HOWEVER
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
SPEAK
OF
HIM
WHO
MUST
BE
ACKNOWLEDGED
WHO
IS
FROM
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
SON
HIS
SOURCES
ST
HILARY
OF
POITIERS
THE
TRINTIY
TO
AD
THUS
AS
I
HAVE
POINTED
OUT
BEFORE
GAUL
SPAIN
ITALY
AFRICA
EGYPT
PALASTINE
AND
THE
LANDS
OF
THE
GREEKS
ALL
OF
CHRISTNEDOM
AT
THAT
TIME
ALL
HAVE
FATHERS
WHO
CAN
BE
CITED
TO
SHOW
THAT
THEY
CONFESS
THE
DOCTRINE
EXPRESSED
BY
THE
FILIOQUE
I
SUGGEST
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
THAT
THEY
COME
UP
WITH
SOME
OF
THE
FATHERS
BESIDES
ST
JOHN
OF
DAMASCUS
WHO
ALL
WILL
ADMIT
DENIED
THE
FILIOQUE
TO
SUPPORT
THEIR
VIEWS
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
BRING
UP
THE
PROCEEDS
FROM
THE
FATHER
LINE
OF
THE
CREED
OR
THE
GOSPEL
OF
JOHN
FOR
THAT
SAYS
WHAT
WE
BELIEVE
ALSO
BUT
IT
DOES
NOT
SAY
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
DOES
NOT
PROCEED
FROM
THE
SON
ONLY
THAT
HE
DOES
PROCEED
FROM
THE
FATHER
