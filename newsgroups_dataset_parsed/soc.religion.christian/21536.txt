re
dreams
and
out
of
body
incidents
david
e
goggin
writes
im
fairly
new
to
these
groups
tho
some
have
heard
from
me
before
welcome
id
like
to
get
your
comments
on
a
question
that
has
been
on
my
mind
a
lot
what
moralsethics
apply
to
dreams
and
outofbody
incidents
in
normal
dreams
you
cant
control
anything
so
obviously
you
arent
morally
responsible
for
your
actions
hm
i
get
a
little
queasy
around
the
phrase
arent
morally
responsible
perhaps
because
ive
heard
it
misused
so
many
times
i
remember
in
college
some
folk
trying
to
argue
that
a
person
who
was
drunk
was
not
morally
responsible
for
his
actions
in
general
most
folk
cant
control
their
dreams
but
perhaps
what
you
do
all
day
and
think
about
has
some
impact
on
them
hm
and
im
not
sure
what
actions
are
in
a
dream
but
i
will
note
that
jesus
does
seem
adamant
about
the
fact
that
our
thoughtlife
is
at
least
as
important
as
our
actions
go
lightly
with
this
argument
we
are
all
morally
responsible
for
who
we
are
and
dreams
might
well
be
an
important
part
of
that
now
there
seem
to
be
alternatives
dreams
and
oobes
are
totally
mental
phenomena
in
this
case
no
morality
applies
beyond
what
might
be
called
mental
hygiene
that
is
not
trying
to
think
about
anything
evil
or
indulgining
in
overly
sexy
or
violent
thoughts
i
dont
know
a
thing
about
out
of
body
experiences
ive
had
dreams
some
fairly
vivid
ones
is
an
oobe
just
a
very
vivid
dream
i
would
argue
that
extreme
interest
in
this
sort
of
phenomena
is
a
tad
risky
it
is
probably
much
better
to
think
about
who
jesus
is
and
who
we
are
in
relation
to
that
than
to
cultivate
a
strong
interest
in
dreams
unless
you
feel
plagued
by
dreams
that
are
painful
and
out
of
control
then
pray
about
it
andor
get
help
dreams
and
oobes
have
a
reality
of
their
own
ie
are
another
plane
evidence
for
this
is
that
often
dreams
and
oobes
are
sometimes
done
in
common
by
more
than
one
person
what
on
earth
is
your
definition
of
often
i
know
exactly
one
case
of
two
people
who
had
substantially
the
same
dream
at
the
same
time
and
as
they
were
brothers
who
had
spent
the
day
doing
the
same
things
i
could
see
why
their
dreams
might
be
similiar
anyway
the
only
other
plane
i
know
of
is
the
spiritual
realm
i
dont
think
anyones
dreams
perhaps
outside
the
occasional
prophets
represent
actual
actions
on
an
alternate
plane
if
they
were
real
actions
or
conscious
thoughts
then
yes
they
would
have
direct
moral
significance
like
but
here
we
assume
that
garbled
text
because
the
dream
occurs
in
a
different
environment
then
different
moral
laws
apply
is
my
guess
of
what
you
said
i
dont
see
the
slightest
hint
in
christian
writings
that
ones
environment
changes
the
way
a
person
determines
what
is
moral
for
a
christian
wont
it
always
come
down
to
what
jesus
would
have
us
do
so
there
it
is
is
one
of
these
cases
the
truth
or
does
anyone
know
of
another
alternative
respond
by
post
or
email
truth
i
dont
claim
to
be
an
expert
in
dreams
ill
note
that
the
bible
doesnt
talk
much
about
dreams
outside
of
the
realm
of
god
using
them
to
speak
to
us
with
the
caveat
that
such
messages
are
not
always
very
clear
as
it
warns
somewhere
in
the
ot
given
that
i
would
not
give
them
a
lot
of
attention
unless
you
feel
your
dreams
are
trying
to
tell
you
something
i
would
discount
talk
of
alternate
planes
though
the
only
places
such
concepts
are
commonly
bandied
about
are
for
the
most
part
hostile
to
christianity
though
ive
run
into
the
occasional
exception
if
you
are
or
want
to
be
a
christian
you
want
to
be
very
careful
about
ideas
like
this
