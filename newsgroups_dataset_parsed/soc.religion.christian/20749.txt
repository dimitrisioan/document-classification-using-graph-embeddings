RE
CAN
SIN
BLOCK
OUR
PRAYERS
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
I
HAVE
HEARD
AN
INTERESTING
NOTION
THAT
SIN
CAN
BLOCK
OUR
PRAYERS
TO
GOD
IE
GOD
WILL
NOT
HEAR
OUR
PRAYERS
IF
WE
HAVE
NOT
CONFESSED
OUR
SINS
NOW
I
AM
TOTALLY
SUPPORTIVE
OF
CONFESSING
OUR
SINS
BEFORE
GOD
BUT
I
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
GOD
WILL
SHUT
US
OUT
JUST
BECAUSE
WE
DID
NOT
CONFESS
THIS
IS
KIND
OF
LIKE
THE
IDEA
THAT
SUFFERING
IS
CAUSED
BY
SIN
WHICH
AS
ANY
JOB
READER
WILL
REALIZE
IS
TOO
SIMPILISTIC
REST
DELETED
CAN
THE
FATHER
POSSIBLY
NOT
HEAR
THE
WORDS
OF
HIS
CHILDREN
OF
COURSE
HE
HEARS
ALL
YOUR
PRAYERS
WHETHER
YOU
ARE
A
SINNER
OR
A
SAINT
NO
QUESTIONS
THE
REAL
QUESTION
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ASKING
IS
DOES
SIN
BLOCK
OUR
HEARING
HIS
ANSWER
AND
THE
ANSWER
TO
THAT
QUESTION
IS
A
RESOUNDING
YES
TO
PARAPHRASE
THE
GOSPEL
MANY
ARE
CALLED
BUT
FEW
CHOOSE
TO
LISTEN
AND
SO
IT
IS
WITH
PRAYER
IN
CHRIST
