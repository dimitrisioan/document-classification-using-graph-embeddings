WRITES
TO
ALL
ON
THE
ATHANASIAN
CREED
DO
YOU
HAVE
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
IT
IS
USED
BY
THE
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
IT
IS
PURELY
WESTERN
LIKE
THE
APOSTLES
CREED
THE
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
USE
THE
SYMBOL
OF
FAITH
COMMONLY
CALLED
THE
NICENE
CREED
I
HAVE
SEEN
IT
USED
IN
AN
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
ONCE
ALTHOUGH
I
CANT
RECALL
WHY
I
FOUND
IT
ODD
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
ALSO
I
OBJECT
TO
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
THE
ORTHODOX
DELETE
THE
FILIOQUE
FROM
THE
ORIGINAL
FORM
OF
THE
CREED
THE
CREED
ORIGINALLY
DID
NOT
CONTAIN
THAT
PHRASE
AND
IT
IS
NOT
PRESENT
IN
THE
GREEK
ORIGINAL
WHICH
HANGS
BY
MY
DESK
NOT
INTENDING
TO
START
A
FLAME
WAR
WE
DIDNT
NEED
TO
DELETE
WHAT
WASNT
