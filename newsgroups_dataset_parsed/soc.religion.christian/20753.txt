RE
SOME
QUESTIONS
FROM
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
STEVEN
R
HOSKINS
WROTE
HI
I
AM
NEW
TO
THIS
NEWSGROUP
AND
ALSO
FAIRLY
NEW
TO
CHRISTIANITY
I
REALIZE
I
AM
VERY
IGNORANT
ABOUT
MUCH
OF
THE
BIBLE
AND
QUITE
POSSIBLY
ABOUT
WHAT
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
HOLD
AS
TRUE
THIS
I
AM
TRYING
TO
RECTIFY
BY
READING
THE
BIBLE
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
HELPFUL
TO
ALSO
READ
A
GOOD
INTERPRETATIONCOMMENTARY
ON
THE
BIBLE
OR
OTHER
RELEVANT
ASPECTS
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
ONE
OF
MY
QUESTIONS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
IS
CAN
ANYONE
RECOMMEND
A
GOOD
READING
LIST
OF
THEOLOGICAL
WORKS
INTENDED
FOR
A
LAY
PERSON
ID
RECOMMEND
MCDOWELLS
EVIDENCE
THAT
DEMANDS
A
VERDICT
BOOKS
I
THINK
AND
MANFRED
BRAUCHS
HARD
SAYINGS
OF
PAUL
HE
ALSO
MAY
HAVE
DONE
HARD
SAYINGS
OF
JESUS
MY
FOCUS
WOULD
BE
FOR
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
TO
STRUGGLE
WITH
HIS
FAITH
AND
BE
ENCOURAGED
BY
THE
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
ESPECIALLY
ONE
WHO
COMES
FROM
A
BACKGROUND
WHICH
EMPHASIZES
KNOWABLE
FAITH
