MICHAEL
D
WALKER
WRITES
THAT
LAST
PARAGRAPH
JUST
ABOUT
KILLED
ME
THE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
ACCEPTED
AS
INSPIRED
SCRIPTURE
BY
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
WHICH
HAS
EXISTED
MUCH
LONGER
THAN
ANY
PROTESTANT
CHURCH
OUT
THERE
IT
WAS
MARTIN
LUTHER
WHO
BEGAN
HACKING
UP
THE
BIBLE
AND
DECIDING
TO
REMOVE
CERTAIN
BOOKSNOT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
DECIDED
TO
ADD
SOME
MUCH
LATERTHAT
IS
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CATHOLIC
AND
PROTESTANT
BIBLES
THIS
IS
MISLEADING
AT
BEST
THE
QUESTION
REALLY
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
THE
STATUS
OF
THE
GREEK
SEPTUAGINT
VERSUS
HEBREW
SCRIPTURE
AND
THE
ISSUE
PREDATES
THE
REFORMATION
BY
QUITE
A
BIT
JEROME
WAS
NEGATIVE
ABOUT
THE
DEUTERONCANONICALS
AND
IN
FACT
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
TRANSALTED
THEM
HE
PUT
THEM
AFTER
THE
HEBREW
CANON
REORDERED
FROM
THE
GREEK
ORDERING
TO
THE
HEBREW
ONE
HIS
TRANSLATIONS
OF
THEM
WERE
QUICKANDDIRTY
ALSO
HE
REPORTS
HAVING
DONE
ONE
OF
THEM
IN
ONE
DAY
AND
ANOTHER
OVERNIGHT
JUST
DICTATING
HIS
TRANSLATION
TO
AN
AMANUENSIS
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
IT
IS
THE
VULGATE
AND
ALL
OF
ITS
MASSIVE
IMPORTANCE
IN
WESTERN
CHRISTIANITY
ALONG
WITH
THE
VENERATION
OF
JEROME
WHICH
TOOK
THE
FIRST
STEPS
IN
REDUCING
THESE
BOOKS
FROM
THE
STATUS
THEY
HAD
AND
HAVE
AMONG
THE
GREEKS
FURTHERMORE
IT
IS
INACCURATE
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
REFORMERS
THREW
OUT
THESE
BOOKS
BASICALLY
THEY
JUST
PLACED
THEM
IN
A
SECONDARY
STATUS
AS
JEROME
HAD
ALREADY
DONE
BUT
WITH
THE
ADDITIONAL
WARNING
THAT
DOCTRINE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
BASED
ON
CITATIONS
FROM
THESE
ALONE
I
THINK
THAT
THE
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
HEBREW
ORIGINALS
IS
SOUND
THOUGH
IT
SEEMS
SOMEWHAT
ARBITRARY
TO
DISALLOW
ON
THE
FACE
OF
IT
A
TRANSLATION
AS
PART
OF
A
COLLECTION
WHOSE
PRINCIPLES
OF
SELECTION
IN
HEBREW
OR
GREEK
ARE
CONFUSED
OR
UNKNOWN
AND
LIKELY
FRAUGHT
WITH
ACCIDENT
IT
ALSO
SEEMS
TO
PLAY
INTO
A
TENDENTIOUS
NOTION
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
LANGUAGES
BEING
SOMEHOW
MORE
INSPIRED
AS
IF
MAGICAL
AND
CONVEYING
A
MESSAGE
UNTRANSLATABLE
THAN
A
TRANSLATION
AS
IF
WE
COULD
NOT
HEAR
GODS
WORD
TO
THE
JEWS
IN
GREEK
OR
GERMAN
OR
ENGLISH
THIS
TENDENCY
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
GOT
A
BIG
BOOST
IN
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
PROTESTANTISM
EVEN
TO
THE
POINT
OF
CURRENT
INERRANCY
BIZARRENESS
DESPITE
THE
MORE
BASIC
UNDERLYING
TENDENCY
OF
THE
REFORMERS
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
TEXTS
SHOULD
AND
COULD
BE
TRANSLATED
IF
WE
CAN
PROFIT
FROM
AN
ENGLISH
RENDERING
OF
HEBREW
AND
GREEK
THERE
IS
SURELY
LITTLE
REASON
TO
KEEP
SIRACH
AT
LEAST
OUT
OF
OUR
BIBLES
AND
OF
COURSE
ANGLICANS
DONT
DO
SO
FOR
TEXTS
ORIGINALLY
IN
GREEK
IT
WOULD
SEEM
MORE
TO
BE
ANTIGREEK
PREJUDICE
NOTABLY
BY
THE
TIME
THE
HEBREW
CANON
IS
FULLY
ATTESTED
INCLUDING
ANTICHRISTIAN
PREJUDICE
WHICH
LED
TO
THE
JEWISH
ABANDONMENT
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
WHICH
IS
OPERATIVE
BTW
READERS
MAY
ENJOY
SOME
LECTURES
OF
BRUCE
METZGER
ON
THE
ISSUES
OF
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
BIBLE

SOME
OF
WHAT
I
SAID

JEROME
