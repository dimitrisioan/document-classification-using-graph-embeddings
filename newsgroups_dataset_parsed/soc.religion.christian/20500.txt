MANY
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
IN
ABSTINENCE
BUT
IN
A
MOMENT
WILL
BE
OVERCOME
BY
DESIRE
WE
ALL
COMPROMISE
AND
RATIONALIZE
POOR
CHOICES
SIN
LAST
WEEK
I
WAS
GUILTY
OF
ANGER
JEALOUSY
AND
WHOLE
MESS
OF
OTHER
STUFF
YET
I
AM
FORGIVEN
AND
NOT
CONDEMNED
TO
SUFFER
WITH
AIDS
TO
EVEN
SUGGEST
THAT
AIDS
IS
DESERVED
IS
LUDICROUS
SOME
RULES
ARE
MADE
BECAUSE
AT
SOME
POINT
MAN
IS
TOO
STUPID
TO
KNOW
BETTER
YET
EVENTUALLY
MAN
LEARNS
BUT
ONLY
AFTER
GETTING
A
LESSON
FROM
EXPERIENCE
YES
ITS
IMPORTANT
TO
REALIZE
THAT
ALL
ACTIONS
HAVE
CONSEQUENCES
AND
THAT
RULES
WERE
MADE
FOR
OUR
OWN
GOOD
BUT
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
A
DISEASE
IS
A
PUNISHMENT
FOR
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
SIN
I
THINK
IS
TAKING
THINGS
MUCH
TOO
FAR
IF
WE
GOT
SOME
KIND
OF
MOUTH
DISEASE
FOR
LYING
WOULD
ANY
OF
US
HAVE
MOUTHS
LEFT
WHAT
IF
WE
DEVELOPED
BLINDNESS
EVERY
TIME
WE
LUSTED
AFTER
SOMEONE
OR
SOMETHING
I
DARE
SAY
ALL
OF
US
WOULD
BE
WALKING
INTO
WALLS
I
WONDER
IF
AIDS
WOULD
BE
A
PROBLEM
NOW
IF
PEOPLE
DIDNT
GET
INVOLVED
IN
DEVIANT
SEXUAL
BEHAVIOUR
CERTAINLY
PEOPLE
WHO
RECEIVED
TAINTED
BLOOD
ARE
NOT
TO
BLAME
BUT
IT
JUST
GOES
TO
SHOW
THAT
ALL
MANKIND
IS
AFFECTED
BY
THE
ACTIONS
OF
A
FEW
YES
SIN
CAN
HAVE
TERRIBLE
CONSEQUENCES
BUT
WE
NEED
TO
BE
REAL
CAREFUL
WHEN
SAYING
THAT
THE
CONSEQUENCES
ARE
A
PUNISHMENT
FOR
SIN
THE
JEWS
OF
JESUSS
TIME
BELIEVED
THAT
ALL
SICKNESS
WAS
THE
RESULT
OF
A
SIN
THEN
JESUS
HEALED
A
BLIND
MAN
AND
SAID
THAT
MAN
WAS
BLIND
TO
SHOW
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
SIN
IF
AIDS
OR
ANY
OTHER
STD
IS
A
PUNISHMENT
FOR
SEXUAL
SIN
WHAT
DO
WE
DO
WITH
DISEASES
LIKE
CANCER
OR
MULTIPLE
SCLEROSIS
WHICH
ARE
JUST
AS
DEBILITATING
AND
TERRIBLE
AS
AIDS
YET
ARE
NOT
USUALLY
LINKED
TO
A
SPECIFIC
BEHAVIOR
OR
LIFESTYLE
IN
ADDITION
IMHO
FORGIVENESS
IS
NOT
THE
END
OF
THINGS
THERE
IS
STILL
THE
MATTER
OF
ATONEMENT
IS
IT
AIDS
I
DONT
KNOW
ATONEMENT
IS
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
BUT
I
THINK
YOUVE
MISSED
THE
MARK
ABOUT
AS
FAR
AS
YOU
CAN
BY
SUGGESTING
THAT
AIDS
IS
AN
ATONEMENT
FOR
SIN
THE
ATONEMENT
FOR
SIN
IS
JESUS
CHRIST
PERIOD
THIS
IS
THE
CENTRAL
MESSAGE
OF
THE
GOSPEL
A
PERFECT
SACRIFICE
WAS
REQUIRED
FOR
OUR
SINS
AND
WAS
MADE
IN
THE
LAMB
OF
GOD
HIS
SACRIFICE
ATONED
FOR
ALL
OF
OUR
SINS
PAST
PRESENT
AND
FUTURE
GOD
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
PENNANCE
FOR
OUR
SINS
NOR
DOES
HE
REQUIRE
US
TO
COME
UP
WITH
OUR
OWN
ATONEMENT
HE
HAS
GRACIOUSLY
ALREADY
DONE
THAT
FOR
US
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
AIDS
OR
SOME
OTHER
CONSEQUENCE
IS
AN
ATONEMENT
FOR
SINS
IS
LITERALLY
SPITTING
ON
THE
SACRIFICE
THAT
JESUS
MADE
IN
CASE
YOU
COULDNT
TELL
I
GET
EXTREMELY
ANGRY
AND
UPSET
WHEN
I
SEE
THINGS
LIKE
THIS
INSTEAD
OF
RATIONALIZING
OUR
OWN
FEARS
AND
PHOBIAS
WE
NEED
TO
BE
REACHING
OUT
TO
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
AND
OTHER
SOCIALLY
UNACCEPTABLE
DISEASES
WHETHER
THEY
GOT
THE
DISEASE
THROUGH
THEIR
OWN
ACTIONS
OR
NOT
IS
IRRELEVANT
THEY
STILL
NEED
JESUS
CHRIST
NO
MORE
AND
NO
LESS
THAN
WE
DO
IVE
SAID
THIS
BEFORE
BUT
I
THINK
ITS
A
GOOD
ANALOGY
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
ARE
MODERNDAY
LEPERS
JESUS
HEALED
MANY
LEPERS
HE
CAN
ALSO
HEAL
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
MAYBE
NOT
ON
THIS
EARTH
BUT
IN
AN
ULTIMATE
SENSE
MY
NEXTDOOR
NEIGHBOR
HAS
AIDS
SHE
HAS
RECENTLY
COME
TO
HAVE
A
MUCH
DEEPER
AND
MORE
COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
HER
THEOLOGY
ISNT
WHAT
I
WOULD
WANT
IT
TO
BE
BUT
GODS
GRACE
COVERS
HER
THE
AMAZING
THING
IS
THAT
SHE
IS
GAINING
WEIGHT
SHES
HAD
THE
DISEASE
FOR
OVER
YEARS
AND
HER
HEALTH
IS
EXCELLENT
APART
FROM
OCCASSIONAL
SKIN
RASHES
AND
SUCH
SHE
ATTRIBUTES
HER
IMPROVEMENT
IN
HER
HEALTH
TO
GODS
INTERVENTION
IN
HER
LIFE
WHO
ARE
WE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
HER
DISEASE
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
PUNISHMENT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
GOD
IS
BEING
GLORIFIED
THROUGH
HER
DISEASE
PAUL

SINGER
HAS
A
GOOD
SONG
TITLE
THAT
I
THINK
APPLIES
TO
ALL
OF
US
BUT
FOR
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
THERE
GO
I
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
MAY
WE
ALL
EXPERIENCE
AND
ACCEPT
GODS
GRACE
