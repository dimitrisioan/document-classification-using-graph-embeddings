RE
A
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
BEE
BOTHERING
ME
MALCUSCO
WRITES
MY
PROBLEM
WITH
SCIENCE
IS
THAT
OFTEN
IT
ALLOWS
US
TO
ASSUME
WE
KNOW
WHAT
IS
BEST
FOR
OURSELVES
GOD
ENDOWED
US
WITH
THE
ABILITY
TO
PRODUCE
LIFE
THROUGH
SEXUAL
RELATIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
MAKE
THAT
AVAILIBLE
TO
EVERYONE
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
IF
SCIENCE
CAN
OVERRIDE
GODS
DECISION
THROUGH
ALTERATIONS
THAT
GOD
WILLS
FOR
US
TO
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
DECIDE
WHO
SHOULD
AND
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
CHILDREN
SHOULD
MEN
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
BABIES
IF
THAT
IS
MADE
POSSIBLE
IN
A
WORD
YES
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
PHYSICAL
KNOWLEDGE
HAS
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
IMPACT
ON
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
IN
THE
PAST
GOD
GAVE
US
THE
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
LIFE
THROUGH
SEXUAL
RELATIONS
NOW
HE
IS
GIVING
US
THE
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
LIFE
THROUGH
IN
VITRO
FERTILIZATION
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
IS
MERELY
COSMETIC
AND
EVEN
IF
WE
GAIN
THE
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
UNIVERSES
WE
WONT
BEGIN
TO
APPROACH
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
THE
POWER
WE
ARE
BEING
GIVEN
IS
A
TEST
AND
I
AM
SURE
THAT
IN
MANY
CASES
WE
WILL
USE
OUR
NEW
ABILITIES
UNWISELY
BUT
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
USING
SEXUALITY
UNWISELY
FOR
MILLENIA
AND
I
HAVENT
HEARD
AN
OUTCRY
TO
ABOLISH
IT
YET
NO
MATTER
HOW
FAR
WE
EXTEND
OUR
DOMINION
OVER
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
WE
ARENT
IMPINGING
ON
GODS
POWER
ITS
ONLY
WHEN
WE
ATTEMPT
TO
GAIN
CONTROL
OF
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
THOSE
THINGS
THAT
CANT
BE
APPROACHED
THROUGH
SCIENCE
AND
LOGIC
THAT
WE
BEGIN
TO
INTERFERE
WITH
GOD
