THE
EMPTY
TOMB
THE
EMPTY
TOMB
CAN
WE
TRUST
IT
BY
THE
LATE
WILBUR
M
SMITH
DD
WHEN
JESUS
WAS
ON
EARTH
HE
MADE
AN
AMAZING
PREDICTION
ABOUT
HIMSELF
AND
FREQUENTLY
REPEATED
IT
LET
ME
QUOTE
IT
FOR
YOU
BEHOLD
WE
GO
UP
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
THE
SON
OF
MAN
SHALL
BE
BETRAYED
UNTO
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
UNTO
THE
SCRIBES
AND
THEY
SHALL
CONDEMN
HIM
TO
DEATH
AND
SHALL
DELIVER
HIM
TO
THE
GENTILES
TO
MOCK
AND
TO
SCOURGE
AND
TO
CRUCIFY
HIM
AND
THE
THIRD
DAY
HE
SHALL
RISE
AGAIN
MATTHEW
WHOLLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
NORMAL
EXPERIENCE
OF
MEN
JESUS
WHO
HAD
NEVER
DONE
ANYTHING
WORTHY
OF
DEATH
EVEN
DESERVING
REPROVAL
KNEW
HE
WOULD
DIE
BEFORE
HE
WAS
YEARS
OF
AGE
HE
KNEW
THE
VERY
CITY
WHERE
HE
WOULD
DIE
HE
KNEW
THAT
THE
RELIGIOUS
LEADERS
OF
HIS
OWN
RACE
WOULD
CONDEMN
HIM
TO
DEATH
HE
KNEW
THAT
ONE
OF
HIS
OWN
WOULD
BETRAY
HIM
HE
KNEW
THAT
BEFORE
HIS
ACTUAL
DEATH
TOOK
PLACE
HE
WOULD
BE
MOCKED
AND
SCOURGED
HE
KNEW
EXACTLY
HOW
HE
WOULD
DIEBY
CRUCIFIXION
ALL
THIS
IS
IN
ITSELF
REMARKABLE
BUT
MORE
AMAZING
THAN
THE
MINUTE
PARTICULARS
OF
HIS
FOREKNOWLEDGE
WAS
WHAT
HE
PREDICTED
WOULD
FOLLOW
SHORTLY
AFTER
HE
WAS
BURIEDTHAT
HE
WOULD
RISE
AGAIN
HE
EVEN
DESIGNATED
THE
TIMEON
THE
THIRD
DAY
BUT
SINCE
IT
IS
ON
THIS
CENTRAL
FACTTHE
DEATH
AND
RESURREC
TION
OF
JESUS
CHRISTTHAT
THE
WHOLE
TRUTH
OR
UNTRUTH
OF
CHRIS
TIANITY
TURNS
LET
US
EXAMINE
IT
MORE
CLOSELY
THE
BODY
OF
JESUS
WAS
EMBALMED
IN
LONG
SHEETS
OF
CLOTH
BETWEEN
THE
LAYERS
OF
WHICH
A
GREAT
ABUNDANCE
OF
SPICES
AND
OINTMENTS
WAS
DISTRIBUTED
THE
BODY
WAS
PLACED
IN
A
TOMB
WHICH
HAD
NEVER
BEFORE
BEEN
USED
AND
A
GREAT
STONE
WAS
ROLLED
AGAINST
THE
ENTRANCE
THE
JEWISH
AUTHORITIES
FULLY
AWARE
THAT
JESUS
HAD
PREDICTED
HE
WOULD
RISE
AGAIN
HAD
THE
STONE
OFFICIALLY
SEALED
AND
ON
SATURDAY
PLACED
A
GUARD
BEFORE
THE
TOMB
TO
PREVENT
THE
DISCIPLES
FROM
CARRYING
AWAY
THE
BODY
EARLY
SUNDAY
MORNING
SOME
OF
THE
WOMEN
WHO
WERE
FAITHFUL
FOLLOWERS
OF
CHRIST
WENT
OUT
TO
THE
TOMB
TO
FURTHER
ANOINT
THE
BODY
TO
THEIR
UTTER
ASTONISHMENT
THEY
FOUND
THE
STONE
ROLLED
AWAY
THE
BODY
GONE
THEY
RUSHED
BACK
TO
TELL
THE
DISCIPLES
SHORTLY
TWO
OF
JESUS
FRIENDS
PETER
AND
JOHN
UTTERLY
SKEPTICAL
ABOUT
THE
WHOLE
AFFAIR
CAME
AND
FOUND
THE
TOMB
EMPTY
JUST
AS
THE
WOMEN
HAD
SAID
EVEN
THE
GUARDS
CAME
HURRYING
INTO
THE
CITY
TO
TELL
THE
SANHEDRIN
THAT
HAD
HIRED
THEM
TO
GUARD
THE
TOMB
THAT
THE
BODY
WAS
GONE
MATTHEW
HOW
DID
THIS
TOMB
BECOME
EMPTY
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
FAMOUS
NEW
TESTAMENT
SCHOLARS
IN
AMERICA
PROFESSOR
OF
NEW
TESTAMENT
LITERATURE
IN
A
LARGE
THEOLOGICAL
SEMINARYWROTE
TO
THE
AUTHOR
IN
ANSWER
TO
MY
QUESTION
OF
HOW
THE
TOMB
BECAME
EMPTY
AND
WROTE
IT
IN
A
LETTER
NOT
MARKED
BY
BITTERNESS
OR
SARCASM
THAT
HE
COULD
NO
MORE
EXPLAIN
HOW
THE
TOMB
BECAME
EMPTY
THAN
HE
COULD
EXPLAIN
HOW
SANTA
CLAUS
COMES
DOWN
THE
CHIMNEY
AT
CHRISTMAS
TIME
BUT
HE
DIDNT
REALIZE
THAT
SANTA
CLAUSE
NEVER
DID
COME
DOWN
ANY
CHIMNEY
AT
CHRISTMAS
TIME
BECAUSE
THERE
NEVER
WAS
A
SANTA
CLAUS
AND
THERE
IS
A
JESUS
HE
DIED
HE
WAS
BURIED
IN
THE
TOMB
OF
JOSEPH
OF
ARIMATHEA
AND
ON
SUNDAY
THE
BODY
WAS
GONE
THOSE
ARE
FACTS
OF
HISTORY
NO
ONE
CAN
ESCAPE
THE
RESPONSI
BILITY
OF
COMING
TO
SOME
CONCLUSION
ABOUT
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENED
BY
MENTIONING
A
MYTH
WE
ALL
ABANDONED
BEFORE
WE
WERE
EIGHT
YEARS
OLD
ANOTHER
PROFESSOR
DR
KIRSOPP
LAKE
OF
HARVARD
UNIVERSITY
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
EMPTY
TOMB
BY
SAYING
WHAT
NO
OTHER
SCHOLAR
IN
THE
FIELD
OF
NEW
TESTAMENT
CRITICISM
HAS
VENTURED
TO
ADOPT
THAT
THE
WOMEN
WENT
TO
THE
WRONG
TOMB
THE
FACTS
ARE
THESE
FIRST
SO
FAR
AS
WE
KNOW
THERE
WAS
NO
OTHER
TOMB
NEARBY
TO
WHICH
BY
MISTAKE
THEY
COULD
HAVE
GONE
SECOND
IT
IS
CONTRARY
TO
ALL
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCE
FOR
THREE
OR
MORE
PEOPLE
TO
FORGET
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THEY
HAVE
BURIED
THEIR
DEAREST
LOVED
ONE
WITHIN
LESS
THAN
THREE
DAYS
EVEN
IF
THE
WOMEN
DID
MISS
THE
TOMB
WHEN
PETER
AND
JOHN
CAME
DID
THEY
TOO
GO
TO
THE
WRONG
TOMB
THIRD
WERE
THE
SOLDIERS
GUARDING
THE
WRONG
TOMB
THERE
IS
OF
COURSE
A
RECORD
OF
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
ESCAPE
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
EMPTY
TOMB
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
ITSELF
NOW
WHEN
THEY
WERE
GOING
BEHOLD
SOME
OF
THE
WATCH
CAME
INTO
THE
CITY
AND
SHOWED
UNTO
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
ALL
THE
THINGS
THAT
WERE
DONE
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
ASSEMBLED
WITH
THE
LEADERS
AND
HAD
TAKEN
COUNSEL
THEY
GAVE
LARGE
MONEY
UNTO
THE
SOLDIERS
SAYING
SAY
YE
HIS
DISCIPLES
CAME
BY
NIGHT
AND
STOLE
HIM
AWAY
WHILE
WE
SLEPT
AND
IF
THIS
COME
TO
THE
GOVERNORS
EARS
WE
WILL
PERSUADE
HIM
AND
SECURE
YOU
SO
THEY
TOOK
THE
MONEY
AND
DID
AS
THEY
WERE
TAUGHT
AND
THIS
SAYING
IS
COM
MONLY
REPORTED
AMONG
THE
JEWS
UNTIL
THIS
DAY
MATTHEW
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
ILLUSTRATION
OF
MANY
LATER
ATTEMPTS
TO
ESCAPE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
TOMB
WAS
EMPTY
YOU
WILL
NOTICE
AT
ONCE
THAT
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
THE
ELDERS
NEVER
QUESTIONED
BUT
THAT
THE
TOMB
WAS
EMPTY
THEY
NEVER
EVEN
WENT
OUT
TO
SEE
IF
WHAT
THE
GUARDS
HAD
REPORTED
WAS
TRUETHEY
KNEW
IT
WAS
TRUE
ANOTHER
FACT
ABOUT
THIS
STORY
MAKES
IT
RIDICULOUS
TO
MAINTAIN
THAT
THE
TOMB
WAS
EMPTYTHE
SOLDIERS
WERE
TOLD
TO
SAY
THAT
JESUS
DISCIPLES
CAME
AND
STOLE
THE
BODY
AWAY
WHILE
THEY
THE
SOLDIERS
WERE
ASLEEP
HOW
COULD
THEY
KNOW
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
WHILE
THEY
WERE
ASLEEP
OBVIOUSLY
SUCH
TESTIMONY
WOULD
BE
VALUELESS
IN
ANY
COURT
EVEN
ASIDE
FROM
THE
SHALLOWNESS
AND
SORDIDNESS
THAT
MAKE
US
REJECT
THE
EXPLANATION
THE
VERY
CHARACTER
AND
THE
LATER
HISTORY
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
COMPEL
US
TO
BELIEVE
THEY
DID
NOT
STEAL
AND
SECRETLY
CARRY
AWAY
THE
BODY
OF
JESUS
FIRST
AS
PROFESSOR
HEFFERN
POINTS
OUT
THE
LEADERS
OF
JUDAISM
IN
JERUSALEM
WHO
HAD
PUT
THE
LORD
JESUS
TO
DEATH
HAD
NOTHING
TO
OFFER
TO
CONTRADICT
THESE
DISCIPLES
AS
THEY
CONTINUED
TO
PREACH
JESUS
AND
HIS
RESURRECTIONBECAUSE
ALL
JERUSALEM
KNEW
THE
TOMB
WAS
EMPTY
IF
THERE
HAD
BEEN
TRICKERY
HERE
SOONER
OR
LATER
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SUSPECTED
THEN
PROVED
SECOND
SURELY
ONE
OF
THE
DISCIPLES
EVEN
MOST
OF
THEM
WOULD
HAVE
CONFESSED
THE
FRAUD
UNDER
THE
TERRIFIC
PERSECUTION
THEY
UNDERWENT
IT
MAY
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
LIVE
A
LIE
BUT
MEN
SELDOM
DIE
FOR
A
LIEAND
MOST
OF
THESE
MEN
DID
THE
RESULT
ULTIMATELY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THAT
THE
MESSAGE
THAT
CHRIST
HAD
RISEN
WOULD
HAVE
SUFFERED
THE
FATE
OF
ALL
SUCH
UNFOUNDED
STORIESIT
WOULD
HAVE
LOST
IT
POWER
INSTEAD
THIS
TRUTH
SWEPT
THE
WORLD
CLOSED
PAGAN
TEMPLES
WON
MILLIONS
OF
DISCIPLES
BROUGHT
HOPE
TO
A
DESPAIRING
HUMANITY
WAS
THE
VERY
FOUNDATION
TRUTH
OF
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
AND
IS
TODAY
AS
BELIEVABLE
AND
AS
FRESHLY
GLORIOUS
AS
EVER
BUT
NOT
ONLY
DID
JESUS
COME
ALIVE
AGAIN
HE
DID
NOT
DISAPPEAR
TO
LEAVE
THE
DISCIPLES
SPECULATING
THROUGH
ALL
THE
SUBSEQUENT
DAYS
AS
TO
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
TO
HIM
INSTEAD
HE
APPEARED
TO
THEMLITERALLY
VISIBLY
FREQUENTLY
HE
APPEARED
TO
THE

OF

UPPER
ROOM
AT

A
WEEK
LATER

WAS

JUST
BEFORE

IN

THESE
HISTOR
ICALLY
RECORDED
APPEARANCES
ALL
KINDS
OF
THEORIES
HAVE
BEEN
PROPOSED
ATTEMPTING
TO
DENY
THEIR
LITERALNESS
BUT
THESE
THEORIES
ARE
UNREASONABLE
WITHOUT
SUPPORTING

NONE
HAS
EVER
WON
THE
UNANIMOUS
APPROVAL
OF
THOSE
WHO
REFUSE
TO

IS
TRUE
WE
ARE

IN
AN
AGE
WHEN

OF

AND

AND
MANY
OF
OUR
PHILOSOPHERS
ARE

LET
US
NOT

WHAT
OF
IT
WHAT
HAS
IT
TO

WITH

WHAT
HAS
IT
TO

JUST
THIS
IT
SEALS
WITH
CERTITUDE
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
CHRIST
JESUS
TAUGHT
MANY
GREAT
TRUTHSESPECIALLY
MANY
ABOUT
HIMSELF
HE
CLAIMED
TO
HAVE
COME
DOWN
FROM
GOD
HE
SAID
HE
WAS
THE
WAY
TO
GOD
HE
SAID
HE
WAS
THE
SON
OF
GOD
WHO
ALONE
KNEW
GOD
PERFECTLY
HE
SAID
THAT
WHOEVER
BELIEVED
ON
HIM
HAD
ETERNAL
LIFE
AND
NO
ONE
ELSE
HAD
IT
HE
SAID
THAT
WHATEVER
WE
ASK
GOD
IN
HIS
NAME
HE
WOULD
GRANT
IT
TO
US
THUS
WHEN
HE
DID
RISE
FROM
THE
GRAVE
ON
THE
THIRD
DAY
HE
REVEALED
THAT
IN
THESE
AMAZING
UNPARALLELED
PREDICTIONS
HE
SPOKE
THE
TRUTH
DO
YOU
KNOW
ANY
REASON
ANY
GOOD
REASON
WHY
WE
SHOULD
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
HIS
WORDS
ARE
ALL
TRUE
THE
POINT
IS
DOES
NOT
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
CONVINCE
US
THAT
HE
IS
NONE
OTHER
THAN
THE
ONE
HE
CLAIMED
TO
BETHE
SON
OF
GOD
AND
THEN
OF
COURSE
THE
FACT
THAT
CHRIST
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
TESTIFIES
THAT
HE
HAS
BROKEN
THE
POWER
OF
DEATH
AND
THAT
HE
WILL
SOME
DAY
RAISE
US
ALSO
UP
FROM
THE
GRAVE
AS
HE
PROMISED
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
THIS
PERSON
JESUS
CHRIST
THE
SON
OF
GOD
IN
ALL
THIS
HE
SHOULD
BE
THE
CORNERSTONE
OF
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
YOUR

FOR
HE
SAID
A
LIFE
BUILT
ON
HIM
WOULD
KNOW
FORGIVENESS
OF

HIS
COMPAN
IONSHIP
AND
HELP
A
JOY
THAT
NO

CAN

TAKE
AWAY
AND
A
HOPE
THAT
SHINETH

UNTO
A

WHO
HAVE
TRIED
IT
DOWN
THROUGH
