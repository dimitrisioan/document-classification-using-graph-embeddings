RE
MORMON
TEMPLES
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
KNEW
ANY
CHANGES
TO
THE
TEMPLE
CEREMONY
WITHIN
THE
LAST
FIFTY
YEARS
ALSO
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
THEY
WERE
MADE
REVELATION
ASSIMILATION
TO
MAINSTREAM
CHRISTIANITY
ETC
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
GOD
MAKERS
WAS
PUBLISHED
QUITE
A
WHILE
AGO
COULD
RITUALS
HAVE
BEEN
CHANGED
SINCE
THEN
I
AM
ALSO
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
FREEMASONRY
ON
EARLY
MORMONISM
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
SMITH
FAMILY
AND
IN
THE
NAUVOO
SETTLEMENT
INFO
ON
ANY
NEW
STUDIES
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
