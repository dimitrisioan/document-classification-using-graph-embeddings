HATE
THE
SIN
HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNERIVE
HEARD
THAT
QUITE
A
BIT
RECENTLY
OFTEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
THE
CONTEXT
REALLY
ISNT
THAT
IMPORTANT
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
THAT
STATEMENT
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
THINK
NOT
HATE
BEGETS
MORE
HATE
NEVER
LOVE
CONSIDER
SOME
SIN
ILL
LEAVE
IT
UNNAMED
SINCE
I
DONT
WANT
THIS
TO
DIGRESS
INTO
AN
ARGUMENT
AS
TO
WHETHER
OR
NOT
SOMETHING
IS
A
SIN
NOW
LETS
APPLY
OUR
HATE
THE
SIN
PHILOSOPHY
AND
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
WE
TRULY
HATE
THE
SIN
THEN
THE
MORE
WE
SEE
IT
THE
STRONGER
OUR
HATRED
OF
IT
WILL
BECOME
EVENTUALLY
THIS
HATE
BECOMES
SO
STRONG
THAT
WE
BECOME
DISGUSTED
WITH
THE
SINNER
AND
EVENTUALLY
COME
TO
HATE
THE
SINNER
IN
ADDITION
OUR
HATRED
OF
THE
SIN
OFTEN
CAUSES
US
TO
SAY
AND
DO
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
TAKEN
PERSONALLY
BY
THE
SINNER
WHO
OFTEN
DOES
NOT
EVEN
BELIEVE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
IS
A
SIN
AFTER
ENOUGH
OF
THIS
THE
SINNER
BEGINS
TO
HATE
US
THEY
CERTAINLY
DONT
LOVE
US
FOR
OUR
CONSTANT
CRITICISM
OF
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
HATE
BUILDS
UP
AND
DRIVES
PEOPLE
AWAY
FROM
GODTHIS
CERTAINLY
CANNOT
BE
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
BUILD
LOVE
IN
THE
SUMMARY
OF
THE
LAW
CHRIST
COMMANDS
US
TO
LOVE
GOD
AND
TO
LOVE
OUR
NEIGHBORS
HE
DOESNT
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HATE
IN
FACT
IF
ANYTHING
HE
COMMANDS
US
TO
SAVE
OUR
CRITICISMS
FOR
OURSELVES
SO
HOW
ARE
CHRISTIANS
SUPPOSED
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
SIN
OF
OTHERS
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
SIN
EITHER
IN
OTHERS
OR
OURSELVESTHROUGH
PRAYER
WE
NEED
TO
ASK
GOD
TO
HELP
US
WITH
OUR
OWN
SIN
AND
TO
HELP
THOSE
WE
LOVE
WITH
THEIRS
ONLY
LOVE
CAN
CONQUER
SINHATRED
HAS
NO
PLACE
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
LOVE
SOMEONE
IS
TO
PRAY
FOR
THEM
