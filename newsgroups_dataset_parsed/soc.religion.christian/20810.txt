RE
WAS
JESUS
BLACK
JESUS
WAS
BORN
A
JEW
WE
HAVE
BIBLICAL
ACCOUNTS
OF
BOTH
HIS
MOTHERS
ANCESTRY
AND
HIS
FATHERS
BOTH
TRACING
BACK
TO
DAVID
IT
SEEMS
REASONABLE
TO
ASSUME
THEREFORE
THAT
JESUS
WAS
SEMITIC
AS
AN
INTERESTING
ASIDE
JESUS
BEING
SEMITIC
MAKES
HIM
NEITHER
WHITE
NOR
BLACK
AND
IN
SOME
SENSE
UNDERSCORES
THE
POINT
MADE
EARLIER
THAT
HIS
COLOR
WAS
NOT
IMPORTANT
IT
WAS
HIS
MESSAGE
HIS
GRACE
AND
HIS
DIVINITY
THAT
WE
SHOULD
CONCENTRATE
ON
FINALLY
I
WOULD
DIRECT
ANYONE
INTERESTED
IN
AFRICAN
INVOLVEMENT
IN
THE
CHURCH
TO
THE
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
CONVERSION
OF
THE
ETHIOPIAN
EUNUCH
IN
ACTS
CHAPTER
I
THINK
ITS
CHAPTER
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
EARLIEST
CONVERSIONS
AND
THE
EUNUCH
TREASURER
TO
THE
QUEEN
OF
THE
ETHIOPIANS
WAS
DEFINITELY
AFRICAN
BECAUSE
ETHIOPIA
AT
THAT
TIME
INDICATED
A
REGION
JUST
SOUTH
OF
EGYPT
MANY
ALSO
SPECULATE
THAT
THIS
MAN
WAS
NOT
ONLY
THE
FIRST
AFRICAN
CHRISTIAN
BUT
THE
FIRST
BLACK
CHRISTIAN
AS
WELL
GOD
BLESS
