JAYNE
KULIKAUSKAS
WRITES
PEOPLE
WHO
REJECT
GOD
DONT
WANT
TO
BE
WTH
HIM
IN
HEAVEN
WE
SPEND
OUR
LIVES
CHOOSING
TO
BE
EITHER
FOR
HIM
OR
AGAINST
HIM
GOD
DOES
NOT
FORCE
HIMSELF
ON
US
I
MUST
SAY
THAT
I
AM
SHOCKED
MY
IMPRESSION
HAS
BEEN
THAT
JAYNE
KULIKASKAS
USUALLY
WRITES
THIS
MUCH
LESS
OFFENSIVE
AND
LUDICROUS
THAN
THIS
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
THE
OFFENSIVENESS
IS
INTENTIONAL
BUT
IT
IS
CLEAR
AND
IT
IS
SOMETHING
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
CONSIDER
JAYNE
STANDS

PRETTY

A
WHOLE
BOOK
PROMOTING
THE
IDEA
CONTAINED
IN
HER
FIRST
SENTENCE
QUOTED
ABOVE
IT
IS

THE
FINAL

EXCELLENT
BOOK
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
HEAVEN
AND
HELL
HIGHLY
RECOMMENDED
ITS
AN
ALLEGORY
OF
SOULS
WHO
ARE
INVITED
INDEED
BESEECHED
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
BUT
REJECT
THE
OFFER
BECAUSE
BEING
WITH
GOD
IN
HEAVEN
MEANS
GIVING
UP
THEIR
FALSE
PRIDE
