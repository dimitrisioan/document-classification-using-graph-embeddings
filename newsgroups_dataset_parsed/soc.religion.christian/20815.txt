FAQ
AND
DARIUS
RESPONSE
DELETED
DARIUS
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
HOW
MUCH
MORE
NEEDS
TO
BE
SAID
OTHER
THAN
THE
FAQ
I
THINK
PAULS
COMMENTS
ON
ESTEEMING
ONE
DAY
OVER
ANOTHER
ROM
IS
PROBABLY
ALL
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
SAID
I
ACCEPT
THAT
DARIUS
IS
DOING
WHAT
HE
DOES
IN
HONOR
OF
THE
LORD
I
JUST
WISH
HE
MIGHT
EQUALLY
ACCEPT
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ESTEEM
ALL
DAYS
ALIKE
ARE
SIMILARLY
DOING
THEIR
BEST
TO
HONOR
THE
LORD
I
AM
MYSELF
AN
SDA
AND
I
AM
IN
TOTAL
AGREEMENT
WITH
WHAT
DARIUS
HAS
TO
SAY
I
ALSO
WORSHIP
ON
SATURDAY
TO
HONOR
THE
LORD
YOUR
MENTION
OF
ESTEEMING
ALL
DAYS
ALIKE
IMO
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
THE
FAST
DAYS
OBSERVED
BY
THE
JEWS
BUT
NO
MATTER
HOW
YOU
INTERPRET
THAT
PASSAGE
I
DO
ACCEPT
YOUR
WORSHIP
ON
SUNDAY
AS
BEING
DONE
IN
HONOR
OF
THE
LORD
IN
CONTRAST
WITH
WHAT
MANY
OF
MY
FELLOW
SDA
BELIEVERS
MAY
BELIEVE
TO
ME
THOUGH
THE
BIBLE
OVERWHELMINGLY
POINTS
TO
SATURDAY
AS
THE
DAY
TO
BE
KEPT
IN
HONOR
OF
CREATION
AND
OF
GODS
DELIVERANCE
OF
THE
ISRAELITES
FROM
EGYPTIAN
BONDAGE
TO
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
ATTEMPT
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
MY
OBSERVANCE
OF
SATURDAY
IS
BEING
LEGALISTIC
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
NOT
THE
CASE
RATHER
KEEPING
SATURDAY
ALLOWS
ME
A
FULL
DAY
TO
REST
AND
CONTEMPLATE
GODS
GOODNESS
AND
GRACE
HOWEVER
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
CLEAR
THAT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THERES
UNAMBIGUOUS
PROOF
THAT
REGULAR
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
WAS
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
AS
I
INDICATED
THERE
ARE
RESPONSES
ON
BOTH
OF
THE
PASSAGES
CITED
SIMILARLY
WITH
COR
IT
SAYS
THAT
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
THEY
SHOULD
SET
ASIDE
MONEY
FOR
PAULS
COLLECTION
NOW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
GATHERED
SPECIALLY
TO
DO
THIS
OR
THAT
THEY
DID
IT
IN
THEIR
HOMES
I
CANT
DISPROVE
IT
BUT
THE
OBVIOUS
TIME
FOR
A
CONGREGATION
TO
TAKE
AN
OFFERING
WOULD
BE
WHEN
THEY
NORMALLY
GATHER
FOR
WORSHIP
AND
IF
THEY
WERE
EXPECTED
TO
DO
IT
IN
THEIR
HOMES
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
REASON
TO
MENTION
A
SPECIFIC
DAY
THE
IDEA
WAS
INTRODUCED
TO
ME
ONCE
THAT
THE
REASON
PAUL
WANTED
THE
CORINTHIANS
TO
LAY
ASIDE
MONEY
FOR
THE
COLLECTION
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
WAS
BECAUSE
THAT
WAS
WHEN
THEY
RECEIVED
THEIR
WEEKLY
WAGES
PAUL
WANTED
THEM
TO
LAY
ASIDE
MONEY
FOR
THE
COLLECTION
AS
FIRST
PRIORITY
BEFORE
SPENDING
THEIR
MONEY
ON
OTHER
THINGS
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
PROOF
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
FOR
THIS
THOUGH
ALTHOUGH
IT
WOULD
EXPLAIN
WHY
THEY
WOULD
LAY
ASIDE
MONEY
IN
THEIR
HOMES
INSTEAD
OF
A
MEETING
SO
I
THINK
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
READING
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
EVERY
WEEK
SIMPLY
MEANS
EVERY
TIME
THEY
GATHER
FOR
WORSHIP
I
THINK
THE
REASON
WE
HAVE
ONLY
IMPLICATIONS
AND
NOT
CLEAR
STATEMENTS
IS
THAT
THE
NT
AUTHORS
ASSUMED
THAT
THEIR
READERS
KNEW
WHEN
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
WAS
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
ASSUME
THAT
THE
CHRISTIANS
IN
THE
NT
REGULARLY
WORSHIPPED
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
I
ASSUME
THAT
THE
CHRISTIANS
IN
THE
NT
REGULARLY
WORSHIPPED
ON
THE
SEVENTH
DAY
BUT
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
WE
ONLY
HAVE
IMPLICATIONS
BECAUSE
THE
AUTHORS
DID
ASSUME
THE
READER
KNEW
WHEN
WORHIP
WAS
MARK
