WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
PARDON
ME
A
HUMBLE
ATHEIST
BUT
EXACTLY
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
HOLDING
A
REVEALED
TRUTH
WITH
BLIND
FAITH
AS
ITS
BASIS
IE
REGARDLESS
OF
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
YOU
MAY
FIND
TO
THE
CONTRARY
AS
AN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
FULLY
EXPECTING
PEOPLE
TO
BELIEVE
YOU
AND
ARROGANCE
THEY
SOUND
LIKE
ONE
AND
THE
SAME
TO
ME
PIXIE
PS
IF
YOU
DO
SINCERELY
BELIEVE
THAT
A
GOD
EXISTS
WHY
DO
YOU
FOLLOW
IT
BLINDLY
WHY
DO
WE
FOLLOW
GOD
SO
BLINDLY
HAVE
YOU
EVER
ASKED
A
PHYSICALLY
BLIND
PERSON
WHY
HE
OR
SHE
FOLLOWS
A
SEEING
EYE
DOG
THE
ANSWER
IS
QUITE
SIMPLETHE
DOG
CAN
SEE
AND
THE
BLIND
PERSON
CANNOT
I
ACKNOWLEDGE
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
THAT
I
AM
BLIND
I
SEE
BUT
I
SEE
ILLUSIONS
AS
WELL
AS
REALITY
WATCHED
TV
LATELY
I
HEAR
BUT
I
HEAR
LIES
AS
WELL
AS
TRUTH
LISTEN
TO
YOUR
RADIO
OR
READ
A
NEWSPAPER
REMEMBER
ALL
THAT
TASTES
WELL
IS
NOT
HEALTHY
SO
I
RELY
ONE
THE
ONE
WHO
CAN
SEE
HEAR
AND
TASTE
EVERYTHING
AND
KNOWS
WHAT
IS
REAL
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
THAT
IS
GOD
OF
COURSE
YOU
MAY
ASK
IF
I
CANNOT
TRUST
MY
OWN
SENSES
HOW
DO
I
KNOW
WHETHER
WHAT
I
SEE
AND
HEAR
ABOUT
GOD
IS
TRUTH
OR
A
LIE
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
NEED
FAITH
TO
BE
SAVED
WE
MUST
FORCE
OURSELVES
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
KNOWS
THE
TRUTH
AND
LOVES
US
ENOUGH
TO
SHARE
IT
WITH
US
EVEN
WHEN
IT
DEFIES
WHAT
WE
THINK
WE
KNOW
WHY
WOULD
HE
HAVE
CREATED
US
IF
HE
DID
NOT
LOVE
US
ENOUGH
TO
HELP
US
THROUGH
THIS
WORLD
I
ALSO
DO
TRUST
MY
EXPERIENCES
TO
SOME
EXTENT
WHEN
I
DO
THINGS
THAT
DEFY
THE
SEEMING
LOGIC
OF
MY
EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE
IT
IS
WHAT
MY
FATHER
COMMANDS
ME
TO
DO
AND
I
SEE
THE
RESULTS
IN
THE
LONG
TERM
I
FIND
THAT
HE
HAS
LED
ME
IN
THE
PROPER
DIRECTION
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
DID
NOT
FEEL
RIGHT
AT
THE
TIME
THIS
IS
WHERE
OUR
WORKS
AS
CHRISTIANS
ARE
IMPORTANT
AS
EXERCISES
OF
THE
BODY
MAKE
THE
BODY
STRONG
EXCERCISES
OF
FAITH
MAKE
THE
FAITH
STRONG
AS
FOR
YOU
NO
ONE
CAN
CONVERT
YOU
YOU
MUST
CHOOSE
TO
FOLLOW
GOD
OF
YOUR
OWN
WILL
IF
YOU
ARE
EVER
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
ALL
WE
AS
CHRISTIANS
WISH
TO
DO
IS
SHARE
WITH
YOU
THE
LOVE
WE
HAVE
RECEIVED
FROM
GOD
IF
YOU
REJECT
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
ACCEPT
YOUR
DECISION
ALTHOUGH
WE
ALWAYS
KEEP
THE
OFFER
OPEN
TO
YOU
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TO
FIND
OUT
WHY
WE
BELIEVE
WHAT
WE
BELIEVE
I
CAN
ONLY
SUGGEST
YOU
TRY
PRAYING
FOR
FAITH
READING
THE
BIBLE
AND
ASKING
CHRISTIANS
ABOUT
THEIR
EXPERIENCES
PERSONALLY
THEN
YOU
MAY
GROW
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHY
WE
BELIEVE
WHAT
WE
DO
IN
DEFIANCE
OF
THE
LOGIC
OF
THIS
WORLD
MAY
THE
LORD
BRING
PEACE
TO
YOU
MALCUSCO
