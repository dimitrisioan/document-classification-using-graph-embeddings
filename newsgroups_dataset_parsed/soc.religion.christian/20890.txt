RE
SSPX
SCHISM
BOB
VAN
CLEEF
WRITES
IF
THE
PAPACY
IS
INFALLIBLE
AND
THIS
IS
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
THEN
THE
POPE
CANNOT
BE
WRONG
IF
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THIS
IS
NOT
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
BUT
A
MATTER
OF
CHURCH
LAW
THEN
WE
SHOULD
STILL
OBEY
AS
THE
POPE
IS
THE
LEGAL
HEAD
OF
THE
CHURCH
IN
OTHER
WORDS
GIVEN
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
INFALLIBILITY
WE
HAVE
NO
CHOICE
BUT
TO
OBEY
THIS
IS
A
PRIMARY
PROBLEM
IN
THE
CHURCH
TODAY
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
IS
MORE
OR
LESS
HERESY
YOU
MIGHT
CALL
IT
INFALLIBILISM
ITS
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
POPE
IS
ALWAYS
RIGHT
IN
EVERYTHING
HE
SAYS
OR
DOES
THIS
IS
VIRTUALLY
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
ESPECIALLY
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
THE
POPE
IS
ONLY
INFALLIBLE
UNDER
CERTAIN
VERY
SPECIFIC
AND
WELLDEFINED
CONDITIONS
WHEN
THESE
CONDITIONS
ARE
NOT
MET
HE
CAN
MAKE
MISTAKES
HE
CAN
MAKE
BIG
MISTAKES
A
COUPLE
HISTORICAL
EXAMPLES
COME
TO
MIND
BISHOP
ROBERT
GROSSETESTE
WAS
PERHAPS
THE
GREATEST
PRODUCT
OF
THE
ENGLISH
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
AT
ONE
POINT
DURING
HIS
CAREER
THE
REIGNING
POPE
DECIDED
TO
INSTALL
ONE
OF
HIS
NEPHEWS
IN
AN
ENGLISH
SEE
BISHOP
GROSSETESTE
SAID
THAT
THIS
WOULD
HAPPEN
OVER
HIS
DEAD
BODY
THOUGH
MAYBE
NOT
IN
SO
MANY
WORDS
YOU
HAVE
TO
TREAT
POPES
WITH
RESPECT
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
ARE
WRONG
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
THIS
NEPHEW
WOULD
JUST
COLLECT
THE
INCOME
OF
THE
SEE
AND
PROBABLY
NEVER
SET
FOOT
THERE
THIS
WOULD
DEPRIVE
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
SEE
OF
A
SHEPHERD
BISHOP
GROSSETESTE
WAS
QUITE
RIGHT
IN
WHAT
HE
DID
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
IS
THAT
OF
POPE
JOHN
XXII
A
POPE
OF
THE
MIDDLE
AGES
HE
DECIDED
THAT
SOULS
THAT
WERE
SAVED
DID
NOT
ENJOY
THE
BEATIFIC
VISION
UNTIL
THE
LAST
JUDGEMENT
HE
DECIDED
THAT
THIS
SHOULD
BE
A
DEFINED
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
CHURCH
THOUGH
HE
DIDNT
QUITE
GET
AROUND
TO
DEFINING
IT
NOW
THERES
NO
WAY
THIS
IS
COMPATIBLE
WITH
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
THE
POPES
DOCTRINE
WAS
CRITICISED
BY
MANY
IN
THE
CHURCH
HE
WENT
SO
FAR
AS
TO
PUT
A
NUMBER
OF
HIS
OPPONENTS
IN
JAIL
EVEN
IN
THE
END
HE
HAD
TO
ADMIT
HIS
MISTAKE
SHORTLY
BEFORE
HE
DIED
HE
RECANTED
HIS
SUCCESSOR
MADE
THE
EXACT
OPPOSITE
IDEA
A
DOGMA
OF
THE
CHURCH
IF
YOU
CONSULT
ANY
OF
THE
GREAT
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGIANS
WHO
TREAT
OF
SUCH
SUBJECTS
SUCH
AS
ST
ROBERT
BELLARMINE
A
DOCTOR
OF
THE
CHURCH
YOU
WILL
FIND
DETAILED
DISCUSSIONS
OF
WHETHER
THE
POPE
CAN
PERSONALLY
FALL
INTO
HERESY
OR
SCHISM
THE
TEACHING
OF
ALL
SUCH
THEOLOGIANS
IS
THAT
THE
COMMANDS
OF
A
POPE
MUST
BE
RESISTED
IF
THEY
ARE
TO
THE
DETRIMENT
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
A
POPES
AUTHORITY
IS
GIVEN
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
BUILDING
UP
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
COMMANDS
IN
CONFLICT
WITH
THIS
PURPOSE
HAVE
NO
LEGAL
OR
MORAL
FORCE
