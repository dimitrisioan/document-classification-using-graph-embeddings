recently
on
this
list
in
the
last
few
days
ive
heard
the
passage
from
revelation
whoever
adds
to
the
sacred
words
of
this
bookwhoever
removes
words
from
this
book
i
feel
this
is
ridiculous
for
two
reasons
good
reasons
deleted
ai
if
one
takes
the
translation
of
this
book
in
rev
or
somewhere
around
there
to
mean
all
of
scripture
then
all
of
us
are
likely
holding
something
that
is
in
violation
of
this
command
its
even
worse
than
that
ye
shall
not
add
unto
the
word
which
i
command
you
neither
shall
ye
diminish
from
it
deut
shall
we
rip
out
every
page
from
our
bibles
beginning
from
joshua
through
revelation
