DOES
JUSTJUSTIFIABLE
WAR
EXIST
HI
THERE
NETTERS
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
I
WOULD
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
TO
SEE
SOME
DISCUSSION
ON
IS
THERE
SUCH
A
THING
AS
A
JUSTIFIBLE
WAR
WHAT
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
SEE
IT
SOME
BASIS
FROM
SCRIPTURE
FOR
EITHER
ALL
WAR
IS
WRONG
OR
SOME
WAR
IS
JUSTIFIABLE
TO
GET
THINGS
STARTED
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
OUTLINE
WHY
I
AM
ASKING
THE
QUESTION
IN
MY
HIGH
SCHOOL
DAYS
I
HAD
BEEN
QUITE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
THE
NEW
ZEALAND
CADET
FORCES
THIS
IS
A
BIT
LIKE
ROTC
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
OF
IT
BUT
WITH
A
LOT
MORE
EMPHASIS
ON
FUN
THAN
MILITARY
CAREER
TRAINING
THROUGH
THIS
I
BECAME
EXTREMELY
ENAMOURED
OF
FLYING
HAVE
BECOME
INVOLVED
IN
THE
SPORT
OF
GLIDING
AND
HAVE
A
GREAT
INTEREST
IN
MILITARY
AVIATION
HARDWARE
AS
THE
VERY
BEST
A
REAL
FLYER
COULD
ASK
FOR
MY
FAVOURITE
COMPUTER
GAMES
ARE
THE
ACCURATE
SIMULATIONS
OF
MILITARY
AIRCRAFT
BOTH
PAST
AND
PRESENT
I
BECAME
A
CHRISTIAN
ABOUT
YEARS
AGO
AND
AT
THE
TIME
REJECTED
ALL
MILITARY
ACTIVITY
AS
IMMORAL
FOR
ME
ALL
WAR
WAS
IN
COMPLETE
OPPOSITION
TO
GODS
COMMANDMENTS
TO
LOVE
ONE
ANOTHER
ESPECIALLY
ONES
ENEMIES
DURING
THE
WAR
IN
IRAQ
I
FOUND
MYSELF
WITH
GREAT
EXCITEMENT
LISTENING
TO
THE
REPORTS
OF
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
THE
THE
ATTACKS
USING
THE
AVIATION
TECHNOLOGY
I
SO
ADMIRE
THE
STEALH
BOMBER
THE
AND
STRIKE
AIRCRAFT
ETC
AFTER
THE
WAR
CONCLUDED
I
BEGAN
TO
REALLY
ENJOY
SIMULATIONS
BASED
AROUND
THIS
CONFLICT
GREAT
TO
GO
AND
BOMB
SADDAMS
BIOWEAPONS
PLANTS
IN
AN
ON
MY
COMPUTER
OR
SHOOT
DOWN
SOME
OF
HIS
MIGS
IN
AN
THE
SIMULATION
OF
THE
DEATH
OF
PEOPLE
WAS
A
WONDERFUL
GAME
I
IMAGINE
THE
REAL
PILOTS
VIEW
THE
REAL
THING
IN
MUCH
THE
SAME
WAY
ONE
ONLY
HAS
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
LANGUAGE
USED
TO
SEE
THAT
THE
PERSONAL
IMPACT
OF
WAR
IS
IGNORED
A
BUILDING
CONTAINING
PEOPLE
OR
AN
AIRCRAFT
FLOWN
BY
A
PILOT
IS
SIMPLY
A
TARGET
DEAD
CIVILIANS
ARE
COLLATERAL
DAMAGE
THESE
EUPHANISMS
ARE
A
WAY
OF
REMOVING
THE
REALITY
OF
WAR
FROM
THE
PEOPLE
WHOSE
SUPPORT
ARE
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
CONTINUED
WAGING
OF
WAR
ONE
ONLY
HAS
TO
LOOK
AT
VIETNAM
TO
SEE
HOW
IMPORTANT
PUBLIC
OPINION
IS
NOW
WE
SEE
TROOPS
SPONSORED
BY
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
ENTERING
SOMALIA
AND
THE
PROSPECT
OF
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
IN
THE
MUSLIMCROATSERB
CONFLICT
IN
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
MY
REVULSION
IN
PARTICULAR
TO
THE
SIEGE
OF
SARAJEVO
AND
IN
THE
LAST
FEW
DAYS
OF
SORRY
BOUT
SPELLING
SEBRENITSA
HAS
CAUSED
ME
TO
RETHINK
WHERE
I
STAND
ON
JUSTIFIABLE
WAR
I
WILL
LIST
SEVERAL
WARS
IN
THE
LAST
YEARS
I
CAN
LOOK
AT
EACH
AND
SAY
YES
THIS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
JUSTIFIBLE
THIS
MAY
NOT
THESE
ARE
SIMPLY
MY
GUT
REACTIONS
TO
EACH
IN
MANY
CASES
WITH
THE
BENEFIT
OF
THE
IMPARTIALITY
HISTORY
BRINGS
LET
ME
GO
THROUGH
A
FEW
AND
STATE
SOME
OF
MY
REASONS
FOR
MY
REACTION
I
AM
NOT
A
HISTORIAN
SO
EXCUSE
ANY
HISTORICAL
BLUNDERS
I
AM
WORKING
FROM
POPULAR
HISTORY
AS
IT
IS
KNOWN
IN
NEW

THE

BE
STOPPED

PROBABLY
JUSTIFIABLE
KOREAN
WAR
POLITICAL
EXPANSIONISM
BY

BASICALLY
COMMUNISM

PROBABLY
NOT
JUSTIFIABLE
VIETNAM
AS
ABOVE
WORSENED
BY

THESE
ARE
MY
