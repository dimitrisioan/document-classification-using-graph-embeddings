RE
EASTER
WHATS
IN
A
NAME
WAS
RE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DOUBLE
STAN
DANIEL
SEGARD
DSEGARDNYXCSDUEDU
WROTE
A
LOT
OF
STUFF
DELETED
FOR
THAT
MATTER
STAY
BIBLICAL
AND
CALL
IT
OMAR
RASHEET
THE
FEAST
OF
FIRST
FRUITS
TORAH
COMMANDS
THAT
THIS
BE
OBSERVED
ON
THE
DAY
FOLLOWING
THE
SABBATH
OF
PASSOVER
WEEK
SUNDAY
BY
ANY
OTHER
NAME
IN
MODERN
PARLANCE
WHY
IS
THERE
SO
MUCH
OBJECTION
TO
OBSERVING
THE
RESURRECTION
ON
THE
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
ON
WHICH
IT
ACTUALLY
OCCURED
WHY
JUMP
IT
ALL
OVER
THE
CALENDAR
THE
WAY
EASTER
DOES
WHY
NOT
JUST
GO
WITH
THE
SUNDAY
FOLLOWING
PASSOVER
THE
WAY
THE
BIBLE
HAS
IT
WHY
SEEK
AFTER
UNBIBLICAL
METHODS
IN
FACT
THAT
IS
THE
REASON
EASTER
JUMPS
ALL
OVER
THE
CALENDAR
PASSSOVER
ITSELF
IS
A
LUNAR
HOLIDAY
NOT
A
SOLAR
ONE
AND
THUS
FALLS
OVER
A
WIDE
POSSIBLE
SPAN
OF
TIMES
THE
FEW
TIMES
THAT
EASTER
DOES
NOT
FALL
DURING
OR
AFTER
PASSOVER
ARE
BECAUSE
EASTER
IS
FURTHER
LINKED
TO
THE
VERNAL
EQUINOX
THE
BEGINNING
OF
SPRING
MORE
DELETIONS
SO
WHAT
DOES
THIS
QUESTION
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
EASTER
THE
WHORE
GODDESS
I
AM
ALL
FOR
CELEBRATING
THE
RESURRECTION
JUST
KEEP
THAT
WHORE
OUT
OF
THE
DISCUSSION
YOUR
OBSESSION
WITH
THE
TERM
WHORE
CLOUDS
YOUR
ARGUMENT
WHORE
IS
A
VALUE
JUDGEMENT
NOT
A
DESCRIPTIVE
TERM
MORE
DELETIONS
OVERALL
THIS
ARGUMENT
IS
AN
ILLUSTRATION
OF
THE
ETYMOLOGICAL
FALLACY
SEE
JP
LOUW
SEMANTICS
OF
NT
GREEK
THAT
IS
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
TRUE
MEANING
OF
A
WORD
LIES
IN
ITS
ORIGINS
AND
LINGUISTIC
FORM
IN
FACT
OUR
OWN
EXPERIENCE
DEMONSTRATES
THAT
THE
MEANING
OF
A
WORD
IS
BOUND
UP
WITH
HOW
IT
IS
USED
NOT
WHERE
IT
CAME
FROM
VERY
FEW
MODERN
PEOPLE
WOULD
MAKE
ANY
CONNECTION
WHATSOEVER
BETWEEN
EASTER
AND
ISHTAR
IF
DANIEL
SEAGARD
DOES
THEN
FOR
HIM
IT
HAS
THAT
MEANING
BUT
THAT
IS
A
HIGHLY
IDIOSYNCRATIC
MEANING
AND
NOT
ONE
THAT
NEEDS
MUCH
REFUTATION
