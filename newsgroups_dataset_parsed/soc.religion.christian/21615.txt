TO
COME
OUT
WITH
AN
ARTICLE
STARTING
WITH
RAISED
IN

BY
MEXICAN
PARENTS
MASON
WAS
BEATEN
MY
FACE
WOULD
BE
RED
WITH
ANGER
OVER
THE
INJUSTICE
DONE
TO
MY
MEXICAN
FAMILY
MEMBERS
AND
THE
MEXICAN
COMMUNITY
AS
A
WHOLE
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
OPEN
BIGGOTRY
LIKE
THIS
IS
PRACTICED
AND
ENCOURAGED
BY
THE
SAN
JOSE
MERCURY
NEWS
WHEN
IT
IS
POINTED
AT
THE
CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITY
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
A
CONNECTION
HERE
THAT
IS
NOT
THERE
IN
THE
MEXICAN
VARIANT
YOU
BRING
UP
THAT
IS
MANY
NOT
ALL
EXTREME
FUNDAMENTALIST
CHRISTIANS
USE
THE
EXCUSE
OF
TEACHING
THEIR
CHILDREN
BIBLICAL
MORALITY
TO
JUSTIFY
THIS
SORT
OF
MISTREATMENT
I
DO
NOT
SEE
MANY
MEXICANS
USING
THEIR
MEXICAN
HERITAGE
AS
AN
EXCUSE
FOR
ABUSE
IT
IS
INDEED
THIS
JUDGEMENTAL
CONTROLLING
LEGALISM
OF
MANY
FUNDAMENTALIST
CHRISTIANS
THAT
HAS
LED
ME
TO
REJECT
THAT
BRANCH
OF
OUR
FAITH
AS
NOT
TRUE
TO
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
THE
GOSPEL
OF
LOVE
I
HAVE
SEEN
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
TOO
OFTEN
EVEN
AMOUNG
MY
OWN
RELATIVES
TO
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
NO
RELATIONSHIP
JUDGEMENTALISM
OFTEN
LEADS
TO
OVERLY
STRICT
AND
THUS
ABUSIVE
DISCIPLINE
OF
CHILDREN
THIS
IS
NOT
RESTRICTED
TO
JUST
CHRISTIAN
FUNDAMENTALISM
IT
IS
FOUND
IN
MANY
EXTREME
SECTS
OF
OTHER
LEGALISTIC
RELIGIONS
CAN
A
GOOD
CHRISTIAN
CONTINUE
TO
PURCHASE
NEWSPAPERS
AND
BUY
ADVERTISING
IN
THIS
KIND
OF
A
NEWSPAPER
THIS
IS
REALLY
BAD
JOURNALISM
I
TOO
AM
A
CHRISTIAN
BUT
I
DO
NOT
CONDONE
THE
USE
OF
THE
BIBLE
TO
JUSTIFY
THIS
SORT
OF
ABUSE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
ONLY
BY
EXPOSING
THE
HORRORS
OF
THE
MISAPPLICATION
OF
THE
BIBLICAL
CONCEPT
OF
DISCIPLINE
THAT
SUCH
ABUSES
CAN
BE
STOPPED
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
IS
ALSO
A
CHRISTIAN
DOES
NOT
MEAN
WE
MUST
IDENTIFY
EITH
THEM
THIS
SORT
OF
SIN
NEEDS
TO
BE
MADE
