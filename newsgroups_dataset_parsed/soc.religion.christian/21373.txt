RE
SATAN
KICKED
OUT
OF
HEAVEN
BIBLICAL
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
HELLO
ALL
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
SATAN
I
WAS
TAUGHT
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
THAT
SATAN
WAS
REALLY
AN
ANGEL
OF
GOD
AND
WAS
KICKED
OUT
OF
HEAVEN
BECAUSE
HE
CHALLENGED
GODS
AUTHORITY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
I
CANNOT
FIND
THIS
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
IT
IN
THE
BIBLE
IF
NOT
WHERE
DID
IT
ORIGINATE
SATAN
WAS
ONE
OF
GODS
HIGHEST
RANKING
ANGELS
LIKE
URIEL
RAPHAEL
MICHAEL
AND
GABRIEL
IN
FACT
HIS
NAME
WAS
SATANEL
HE
DID
CHALLENGE
GODS
AUTHORITY
AND
GOT
KICKED
OUT
OF
HEAVEN
A
LOT
OF
THE
MYTHOLOGY
OF
SATAN
HE
LOST
THE
EL
SUFFIX
WHEN
HE
FELL
COMES
FROM
THE
BOOK
OF
ENOCH
AND
IS
NOT
FOUND
IN
THE
BIBLE
READ
THE
BOOK
OF
ENOCH
AVAILABLE
THRU
BOOKSTORES
OR
GET
THE
BOOK
CALLED
ANGELS
AN
ENDANGERED
SPECIES
I
THINK
STEVEN
C
SALARIS
WEREA
LOT
MORE
DANGEROUS
THAN
LIVE
CREW
AND
THEIR
STUPID
USE
OF
FOUL
LANGUAGE
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
IDEAS
WE
HAVE
A
PHILOSOPHY
GEOFF
TATE
