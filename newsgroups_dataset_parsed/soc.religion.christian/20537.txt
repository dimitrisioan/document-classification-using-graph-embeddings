RE
REVELATIONS
HE
DOESNT
CONTRADICT
HIMSELF
THE
CHURCH
IS
TO
LAST
FOR
ALL
TIME
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
USE
THE
CHURCH
TO
BOLSTER
THEMSELVES
THIS
IS
EVIDENT
IN
MANY
LETTERS
FOR
INSTANCE
PAUL
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
SUPERAPOSTLES
TO
THE
CORINTHIANS
CORINTHIANS
HE
MENTIONS
HOW
PEOPLE
WILL
BE
LED
AWAY
BY
MIRACLES
SIGNS
AND
WONDERS
THESSALONIANS
HE
TELLS
TIMOTHY
THAT
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
SOME
WILL
ABANDON
THE
FAITH
AND
TEACH
LIES
TIMOTHY
AND
THAT
SOME
WILL
SEARCH
FOR
TEACHERS
TO
SUIT
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
HEAR
TIMOTHY
SUCH
PASSAGES
GO
THROUGHOUT
THE
LETTERS
AND
JESUS
DOES
WARN
ABOUT
THEM
MATTHEW
BUT
LOOK
AT
THE
PROMISE
IN
THIS
LAST
PART
VERSE
AND
THIS
GOSPEL
OF
THE
KINGDOM
WILL
BE
PREACHED
IN
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
AS
A
TESTIMONY
TO
ALL
NATIONS
AND
THEN
THE
END
WILL
COME
EVEN
TODAY
THERE
ARE
FALSE
TEACHINGS
I
CAN
NAME
TWO
WHICH
I
AM
WELL
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
NONNEED
OF
BAPTISM
AND
THE
PRAYING
OF
JESUS
INTO
YOUR
LIFE
FOR
SALVATION
BOTH
ARE
TAUGHT
BOTH
ARE
DEAD
WRONG
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
TAKEN
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
FROM
SOME
VERSES
INTERPRETED
FROM
OTHERS
AND
JUST
PLAIN
MADE
UP
THE
ONLY
WAY
JESUS
TAUGHT
IS
GIVEN
IN
LUKE
AND
LUKE
HE
THEN
COMMANDS
BAPTISM
IN
MATTHEW
THE
CHURCH
JESUS
FOUNDED
THOUGH
IS
ALIVE
AND
WELL
ITS
NOT
BEING
PERSECUTED
AS
MUCH
AS
BACK
THEN
THE
LAWS
WONT
ALLOW
IT
YET
BUT
IT
IS
BEING
PERSECUTED
