re
revelations
babylon
woo
so
far
weve
had
the
following
interpretations
of
the
figure
of
the
whore
of
babylon
in
rev
a
the
united
states
of
america
b
mho
db
which
was
as
a
figure
of
the
fallen
spiritual
powers
who
corrupt
and
oppress
human
society
c
historical
jerusalem
d
historical
rome
dare
i
suggest
that
the
passage
might
be
many
layered
in
meaning
how
about
the
prophecy
reveals
gods
judgement
on
the
corrupt
idolatrous
state
oppressing
his
chosen
people
d
that
gods
judgement
extends
especially
to
his
once
chosen
city
c
because
despite
that
citys
special
call
it
still
rejected
gods
grace
at
the
decisive
time
rev
also
isnt
equally
suggestive
of
rome
as
jerusalem
that
the
usofa
is
guilty
of
many
of
the
crimes
of
romebabylon
a
and
is
equally
subject
to
gods
judgement
that
the
good
booktm
actually
encompasses
all
these
viewpoints
by
revealing
the
corrupting
spiritual
powers
warring
against
mankind
through
the
very
society
that
weve
created
b
clever
huh
flame
here
no
need
to
argue
at
all
i
think
marys
view
has
a
lot
of
sense
because
there
seems
to
be
a
deliberate
contrast
between
rev
and
rev
the
mortal
jerusalem
chosen
by
god
but
never
historically
fulfilling
its
vocation
and
the
new
jerusalem
perfected
outside
of
history
purely
by
gods
grace
eg
details
like
rev
who
sits
on
many
waters
cf
rev
the
single
stream
in
the
new
jersualem
the
river
of
life
flowing
from
the
throne
of
god
and
of
the
lamb
rex
didnt
understand
your
post
whats
the
relevance
of
babylonian
mystery
religions
to
all
this
please
elaborate
your
ideas
about
ot
the
book
of
rev
why
do
you
freak
at
the
idea
of
a
primarily
spiritual
interpretation
of
rev
id
mail
but
i
cant
get
thru
unknown
or
illegal
user
reflexfnalfnalgov
something
youre
not
telling
us
