RE
REVELATIONS
BABYLON
WOO
SO
FAR
WEVE
HAD
THE
FOLLOWING
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
FIGURE
OF
THE
WHORE
OF
BABYLON
IN
REV
A
THE
UNITED
STATES
OF
AMERICA
B
MHO
DB
WHICH
WAS
AS
A
FIGURE
OF
THE
FALLEN
SPIRITUAL
POWERS
WHO
CORRUPT
AND
OPPRESS
HUMAN
SOCIETY
C
HISTORICAL
JERUSALEM
D
HISTORICAL
ROME
DARE
I
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
PASSAGE
MIGHT
BE
MANY
LAYERED
IN
MEANING
HOW
ABOUT
THE
PROPHECY
REVEALS
GODS
JUDGEMENT
ON
THE
CORRUPT
IDOLATROUS
STATE
OPPRESSING
HIS
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
D
THAT
GODS
JUDGEMENT
EXTENDS
ESPECIALLY
TO
HIS
ONCE
CHOSEN
CITY
C
BECAUSE
DESPITE
THAT
CITYS
SPECIAL
CALL
IT
STILL
REJECTED
GODS
GRACE
AT
THE
DECISIVE
TIME
REV
ALSO
ISNT
EQUALLY
SUGGESTIVE
OF
ROME
AS
JERUSALEM
THAT
THE
USOFA
IS
GUILTY
OF
MANY
OF
THE
CRIMES
OF
ROMEBABYLON
A
AND
IS
EQUALLY
SUBJECT
TO
GODS
JUDGEMENT
THAT
THE
GOOD
BOOKTM
ACTUALLY
ENCOMPASSES
ALL
THESE
VIEWPOINTS
BY
REVEALING
THE
CORRUPTING
SPIRITUAL
POWERS
WARRING
AGAINST
MANKIND
THROUGH
THE
VERY
SOCIETY
THAT
WEVE
CREATED
B
CLEVER
HUH
FLAME
HERE
NO
NEED
TO
ARGUE
AT
ALL
I
THINK
MARYS
VIEW
HAS
A
LOT
OF
SENSE
BECAUSE
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
DELIBERATE
CONTRAST
BETWEEN
REV
AND
REV
THE
MORTAL
JERUSALEM
CHOSEN
BY
GOD
BUT
NEVER
HISTORICALLY
FULFILLING
ITS
VOCATION
AND
THE
NEW
JERUSALEM
PERFECTED
OUTSIDE
OF
HISTORY
PURELY
BY
GODS
GRACE
