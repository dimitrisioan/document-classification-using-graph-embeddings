WRITES
WE
CHOSE
TO
BELIEVE
WHETEVER
WE
WANT
BUT
WE
ARE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
DEFINE
OUR
OWN
CHRISTIANITY
WE
SEE
IN
PARTS
IF
YOU
SEE
SOMETHING
THAT
I
DO
NOT
SEE
OR
VICE
VERSA
IT
DOES
NOT
GIVE
ME
THE
RIGHT
TO
PLAY
JOKES
ON
YOUR
BELIEF
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
IF
CHRISTIANITY
IS
BEING
DAMAGED
BY
IT
IF
PEOPLE
WHO
SPEAK
IN
TONGUES
MAKE
CLAIMS
THAT
THEY
ARE
MIRACULOUSLY
SPEAKING
A
FOREIGN
LANGUAGE
THROUGH
THE
POWER
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
WHEN
IT
CAN
EASILY
BE
SHOWN
THAT
THEY
ARE
SIMPLY
MAKING
NOISES
IT
DAMAGES
ALL
CHRISTIANS
SINCE
MANY
WHO
ARE
NOT
CHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
THE
VARIOUS
SECTS
THE
MORE
MODEST
CLAIM
FOR
TONGUES
THAT
IT
IS
SIMPLY
UNCONTROLLED
PRAISE
IN
WHICH
WORDS
FAIL
YOU
IS
SURELY
THE
ONE
THAT
SHOULD
BE
USED
BY
THOSE
WHO
MAKE
USE
OF
THIS
PRACTICE
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
POINT
THAT
CHARISMATIC
PRACTICES
LIKE
THIS
CAN
LEAD
TO
FORMS
OF
WORSHIP
WHICH
ARE
MORE
ABOUT
THE
WORSHIPPER
SHOWING
OFF
THAN
GENUINE
PRAISE
FOR
GOD
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
JESUS
WARNED
