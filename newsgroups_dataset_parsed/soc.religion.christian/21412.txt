RE
ETHNICITY
IN
WORSHIP
JERRYL
PAYNE
WRITES
TO
SUBLIMATE
A
CULTURE
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
WHAT
YOU
PERCEIVE
AS
UNITY
SEEMS
ANTITHETICAL
TO
THE
VERY
MESSAGE
OF
INCLUSION
THAT
YOU
PREACH
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
THAT
I
DONT
PREACH
IGNORING
OUR
CULTURES
THE
BODY
AS
A
WHOLE
MUST
BE
UNIFIED
THE
QUESTION
IS
SHALL
WE
BE
A
MELTING
POT
BOILING
OURSELVES
DOWN
TO
ONE
LEGITIMATE
EXPRESSION
OR
SHALL
WE
BE
MORE
LIKE
A
STEW
MAINTAINING
THE
TEXTURAL
INTEGRITY
OF
THE
EXPRESSED
DIVERSITY
WHILE
UPHOLDING
THE
UNITY
OF
THOUGHT
IT
RELEASED
ALL
CHURCHES
FROM
THE
USE
OF
THE
LATIN
MASS
UNITY
TO
ALLOW
THEM
TO
SPEAK
TO
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
COMMON
LANGUAGE
DIVERSITY
IN
REVELATION
WE
SEE
THAT
IN
THE
FIRST
CENTURY
CHURCH
THERE
WAS
ONE
CONGREGATION
IN
EACH
MAJOR
CITY
SO
THERE
WAS
ONE
UNIFIED
CHURCH
NOW
IN
EACH
CITY
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
OF
DIFFERENT
CULTURES
NATURALLY
THEY
FORMED
SOMETHING
OF
A
STEW
WITH
DIFFERENT
MEMBERS
HAVING
DIFFERENT
HERITAGES
NEVERTHELESS
THEY
WERE
ONE
BODY
THEY
MET
TOGETHER
SOMETIMES
AS
SMALLER
GROUPS
IN
THEIR
HOMES
AND
SOMETIMES
IN
BIGGER
GROUPS
IN
PLACES
SUCH
AS
THE
TEMPLE
COURTS
NOW
IN
A
PARTICULAR
CITY
THEN
AND
NOW
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
THERE
IS
A
COMMON
LANGUAGE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THAT
REGION
FOR
INSTANCE
IN
ROME
LATIN
WAS
SPOKEN
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
TODAY
ENGLISH
IS
SPOKEN
SO
IT
WOULD
MAKE
SENSE
THAT
CONGREGATIONS
IN
DIFFERENT
CITIES
WOULD
SPEAK
THE
COMMON
LANGUAGE
AND
NOT
NECESSARILY
LATIN
NATURALLY
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
THE
LEAD
EVANGELIST
TO
PREACH
IN
THE
COMMON
LANGUAGE
IN
THE
FIRST
CENTURY
CHURCH
THERE
WERE
PROBABLY
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
THE
CONGREGATION
WHO
COULD
SPEAK
A
GIVEN
TONGUE
TO
TRANSLATE
THE
MESSAGE
FOR
PEOPLE
OF
FOREIGN
ETHNIC
GROUPS
TODAY
HOWEVER
YOU
DONT
SEE
PEOPLE
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
TO
TRANSLATE
SERMONS
EVEN
IN
SOCALLED
PENTACOSTAL
CHURCHES
WE
DO
HAVE
A
MODERN
DAY
EQUIVALENT
THOUGH
BILINGUAL
SPEAKERS
NOW
IN
THE
UNIFIED
CHURCH
OF
WHICH
I
AM
A
MEMBER
SOMETIMES
CALLED
THE
INTERNATIONAL
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
WHEN
WE
ALL
MEET
TOGETHER
ON
SUNDAYS
THERE
ARE
HEADPHONES
ON
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
SPEAK
ENGLISH
FROM
WHICH
THEY
HEAR
AN
ONGOING
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
SERMON
IN
THEIR
NATIVE
TONGUE
NEAT
IDEA
HUH
NOW
WE
MEET
IN
DIFFERENT
SIZE
GROUPS
IN
A
RANDOM
SORT
OF
WAY
ON
SUNDAYS
SO
SOMETIMES
THERE
WILL
BE
A
MEETING
OF
ONLY
HAITIANS
OR
OF
SPANISH
SPEAKING
PEOPLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHO
WILL
HEAR
AN
EVANGELIST
PREACH
IN
THEIR
NATIVE
LANGUAGE
IN
ADDITION
WE
MEET
IN
SMALL
GROUPS
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
DURING
THE
WEEK
FOR
BIBLE
DISCUSSION
GROUPS
AND
DEVOTIONALS
SO
SOMEONE
WHO
SPEAKS
A
DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE
WILL
ALMOST
ALWAYS
BE
WITH
PEOPLE
WHO
ALSO
SPEAK
HIS
LANGUAGE
ASSUMING
THE
CONGREGATION
IS
LARGE
ENOUGH
FOR
THOSE
MEETINGS
AS
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
SPEAK
THE
COMMON
LANGUAGE
THEY
CAN
KEEP
IN
TOUCH
WITH
THEIR
CULTURE
IF
THEY
WANT
BUT
THEY
WILL
ALSO
HAVE
EQUALLY
DEEP
FRIENDSHIPS
AMONG
THEIR
CHURCH
RELATIONSHIPS
WITH
PEOPLE
OF
MANY
VARIOUS
NATIONALITIES
HAS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
CHURCH
BEEN
THWARTED
BY
THIS
ACTION
THE
ACTION
OF
LETTING
CATHOLICS
WORSHIP
IN
A
NATIVE
LANGUAGE
INSTEAD
OF
LATIN
INDEED
NOT
SEE
MY
SECOND
PARAGRAPH
IN
RESPONSE
TO
THE
SECOND
CLIPPING
OF
YOUR
ARTICLE
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
MEAN
THE
ACTION
OF
FORMING
DENOMINATIONS
BASED
ON
A
CULTURE
THEN
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
CHURCH
HAS
BEEN
INDEED
THWARTED
ILL
ASSUME
THE
SECOND
POSSIBLILITY
WHEN
ANSWERING
YOUR
NEXT
CLIPPING
RATHER
I
BELIEVE
IT
HAS
BEEN
ENHANCED
FOR
PAUL
EXHORTS
US
TO
BECOME
AS
ONE
OF
THEM
THAT
WE
MIGHT
REACH
THEM
THUS
IF
A
PERSON
OR
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
FEEL
MORE
COMFORTABLE
AMONG
THEIR
OWN
SHALL
WE
NOT
GIVE
THEM
A
PLACE
WHERE
THEY
CAN
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
WITH
THEIR
HERITAGE
AND
STILL
LOVE
GOD
MY
GUESS
AARON
YOU
HAVE
MET
SOME
NEEDS
OF
PEOPLE
CERTAINLY
BY
HELPING
THEM
TO
BE
PROUD
OF
THEIR
CULTURAL
HERITAGES
WHEN
MOST
DENOMINATIONS
DIDNT
YET
YOU
HAVE
LARGELY
ISOLATED
YOURSELVES
FROM
HAVING
QUALITY
CHRISTIAN
FRIENDSHIPS
OUTSIDE
YOUR
NATIONALITY
AND
YOUR
DENOMINATION
WE
SHALL
CERTAINLY
GIVE
PEOPLE
A
PLACE
TO
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
WITH
THEIR
HERITAGE
HOWEVER
WE
WILL
DO
THIS
IN
A
WAY
THAT
DOES
NOT
DESTROY
CHURCH
UNITY
BUT
RATHER
ENCOURAGES
FRIENDSHIPS
AMONG
ALL
DISCIPLES
THIS
IS
THE
APPROACH
OF
SOME
OF
THE
GROUPS
THAT
YOU
CITE
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
THESE
GROUPS
HAVE
WONDERFUL
INTENTIONS
BUT
THEY
ARE
GOING
ABOUT
THINGS
IN
THE
WRONG
WAY
AND
NAMES
LIKE
THE
AFRICAN
METHODIST
EPISCOPAL
CHURCH
STILL
MAKE
ME
CRINGE
ALTHOUGH
NOT
AS
MUCH
AS
BEFORE
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THERE
WAS
MORE
RACISM
IN
THE
PAST
THAT
CAUSED
SUCH
GROUPS
TO
BE
FORMED
BUT
NOW
WE
SHOULD
TRY
TO
UNITE
I
KNOW
THAT
ITS
HARD
FOR
MANY
PEOPLE
ON
THIS
NEWSGROUP
TO
IMAGINE
THERE
BEING
ONLY
ONE
BODY
OF
PEOPLE
ON
EARTH
BUT
IT
IS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
AND
I
AM
WORKING
TO
MAKE
IT
HAPPEN
HOWEVER
WHAT
MIGHT
BE
A
SMALLER
STEP
TOWARDS
UNITY
WOULD
BE
TAKING
THE
WORD
AFRICAN
OUT
OF
YOUR
DENOMINATIONS
NAME
THEN
PERHAPS
SOMEDAY
A
LONG
TIME
OFF
YOU
CAN
ALSO
REMOVE
THE
METHODIST
EPISCOPAL
PART
ALSO
AND
SIMPLY
BE
PART
OF
THE
CHURCH
WITH
REGARD
TO
INCLUSIVITY
I
NOTE
THT
YOUR
SIG
EMITS
FROM
MIT
AS
YOU
KNOW
THE
TUTE
IS
RELIGIOUSLY
AND
CULTURALLY
DIVERSIFIED
AND
NOT
EVERYONE
WHO
COMES
THERE
IS
IMMEDIATELY
COMFORTABLE
WITH
ENGLISH
MUCH
LESS
AMERICAN
CULTURE
WHAT
SHALL
BE
THE
CONDUCT
OF
THE
CAMPUS
CHURCHES
THEN
SHALL
THERE
BE
ONE
CHURCH
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
UNITY
OR
SHALL
THE
ORGANIZATIONS
LIKE
KCF
BE
USEFUL
IN
HELPING
STUDENTS
NEW
TO
AMERICA
MAKE
THE
TRANSITION
IN
CULTURE
LANGUAGE
AND
THOUGHT
THERE
SHALL
BE
ONE
CHURCH
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
UNITY
AND
IT
SHALL
BE
USEFUL
IN
HELPING
STUDENTS
NEW
TO
AMERICA
MAKE
THE
TRANSITION
IN
CULTURE
LANGUAGE
AND
THOUGHT
WE
SHOULDNT
MAKE
A
NEW
DENOMINATION
TO
TRY
TO
SOLVE
PROBLEMS
THE
WHOLE
DENOMINATIONAL
MINDSET
ONLY
CAUSES
MORE
PROBLEMS
SADLY
IN
THE
AME
CHURCH
WE
RETAIN
AFRICAN
CUTLURE
AT
THE
ROOT
OF
OUR
EXPRESSION
BUT
WE
ARE
BY
NO
MEANS
EXCLUSIVE
SINCE
YOU
LIVE
IN
CAMBRIDGE
I
INVITE
YOU
TO
VISIT
THE
LOCAL
ASSEMBLY
THERE
THANK
YOU
FOR
THE
INVITATION
THAT
SHOWS
ME
THAT
YOU
INDEED
HAVE
THE
HEART
TO
SPREAD
THE
GOSPEL
OF
JESUS
AS
WELL
AS
TAKE
PART
IN
YOUR
CULTURAL
HERITAGE
THANK
YOU
ALSO
FOR
RESPONDING
TO
MY
POST
I
KNOW
ALL
TOO
WELL
HOW
THEY
CAN
BE
VERY
TIMECONSUMING
THE
WHOLE
IDEA
OF
CELEBRATING
YOUR
CULTURE
IS
PAVED
WITH
GOOD
INTENTIONS
BUT
I
STILL
FEEL
THAT
YOU
MUST
RESTORE
AND
PRESERVE
UNITY
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
MY
OWN
CHURCH
THE
BOSTON
CHURCH
HAS
THE
ACAPELLA
SINGING
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
IN
YOUR
POST
YET
DOESNT
LIMIT
EXPRESSION
OF
MY
MEXICAN
CULTURE
EVEN
THOUGH
I
AM
IN
THE
MIT
CAMPUS
MINISTRY
AND
NOT
THE
SPANISH
SPEAKING
ZONE
I
HAVE
MADE
A
COMMITMENT
TO
GOD
THAT
I
WILL
GO
TO
THE
SUNDAY
SERVICES
OF
MY
CHURCH
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
THAT
MY
BROTHERS
AND
SISTERS
HERE
ARE
FULLY
DEVOTED
IN
LOVE
FOR
GOD
AS
HIS
DISCIPLES
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
TONGUES
AS
YOU
MAY
HAVE
ALREADY
PICKED
UP
ON
BECAUSE
OF
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
BIBLICAL
CHRISTIANITY
HOWEVER
I
AM
CERTAINLY
WILLING
TO
VISIT
YOUR
CONGREGATION
PROVIDED
THAT
IT
DOESNT
INTERFERE
WITH
MY
NORMAL
WORSHIP
SINCE
YOU
ALSO
LIVE
IN
CAMBRIDGE
I
ALSO
EXTEND
AN
INVITATION
TO
YOU
TO
VISIT
OUR
SERVICES
AS
OFTEN
AS
YOU
LIKE

CAN
MEET
THE
MIT
STUDENTS
AT
THE

AT

OR
SIMPLY
CALL
ME
AFTER
WEDNESDAY
NIGHT
TO
FIND
OUT
WHERE
THE
SERVICE
WILL
BE
HELD
ON
A
PARTICULAR
DAY
MY
NUMBER
IS
BUT
WILL
BE
IN
A
FEW
WEEKS
FROM
NOW
AND
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
SUMMER
OUR
SERVICE
NORMALLY
LAST
FROM
TO
NOON
BUT
OCCASIONALLY
ARE
LATER
OR
EARLIER
TIMES
PER
YEAR
LET
US
ALWAYS
STRIVE
TO
REACH
ALL
WITH
THE
GOSPEL
BY
ANY
MEANS
NECESSARY
AS
WE
MOVE
FROM
MILK
TO
MEAT
THE
PETTY
THINGS
OF
THE
WORLD
THAT
TEMPORALLY
SEPARATE
US
WILL
DISSOLVE
AWAY
AND
WE
SHALL
STAND
WITH
OUR
NAKED
REALIZATIONS
THAT
GOD
HAS
SHED
HIS
GRACE
ON
ALL
OF
US
HIS
DELIGHTFUL
CREATION
DEFINITELY
LETS
ALSO
STRIVE
TO
GROW
IN
OBEDIENCE

THE
LORD
