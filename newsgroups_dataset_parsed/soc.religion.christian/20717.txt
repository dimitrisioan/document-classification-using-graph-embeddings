WAS
JESUS
BLACK
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
POST
TO
THIS
PARTICULAR
NEWSGROUP
ARE
EITHER
TOO
COWARDLY
TOO
ARROGANT
OR
TOO
APATHETIC
TO
DISCUSS
THIS
ISSUE
SINCE
I
HAVE
YET
TO
SEE
ANY
DISCUSSION
GRACE
MY
COMPUTER
SCREEN
WHILE
IT
HOLDS
PARTICULAR
INTEREST
TO
THE
AFRICANAMERICAN
COMMUNITY
EVERYONE
HAS
SOMETHING
TO
GAIN
FROM
DISCUSSING
IT
AS
ANY
KNOWLEDGABLE
PERSON
SHOULD
KNOW
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
BEEN
USED
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
TO
TIGHTEN
THE
SPIRITUAL
EMOTIONAL
MENTAL
HOLD
SLAVERY
PLACED
ON
THE
MINDS
SOULS
HEARTS
OF
AFRICANAMERICANS
THIS
WAS
MOST
EFFECTIVELY
DONE
BY
THE
DISPLAY
OF
WHITE
ICONS
OF
JESUS
IN
SLAVE
CHURCHES
TO
ENCOURAGE
THE
GODLY
SUPERIORITY
OF
SLAVEOWNERS
IT
WASNT
ENOUGH
THAT
THE
SLAVEOWNER
WAS
YOUR
PROVIDER
BUT
HE
WAS
ALSO
YOUR
GOD
TO
BE
LOOKED
UPON
WITH
UNCONDITIONAL
LOVE
LOYALTY
AND
TO
BE
WORSHIPPED
WITH
GREAT
PRIDE
BUT
HOW
CULTURALLY
BIBLICALLY
ACCURATE
ARE
THESE
ICONS
PICTURES
STATUES
OF
A
BLACK
JESUS
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND
IN
EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES
AS
THAT
OF
A
BLACK
MADONNA
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
BIBLICAL
PHYSICAL
DESCRIPTIONS
OF
JESUS
HIS
HAIR
BEING
COMPARED
TO
THAT
OF
WOOL
HIS
FEET
TO
THAT
OF
BRASS
AND
THINK
ABOUT
THE
AREA
OF
THE
WORLD
WHERE
ALL
BIBLICAL
ACTIONS
TOOK
PLACE
I
WELCOME
ALL
INTELLIGENT
COMMENTARY
ON
THIS
IMPORTANT
TOPIC
FLAMERS
NEED
NOT
REPLY
SHERLETTE
PS
I
EXPECT
AT
LEAST
THIS
TYPE
OF
RESPONSE
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
COLOR
HIS
SKIN
WAS
HIS
ACTIONS
WHAT
HE
DID
FOR
MANKIND
ARE
WHAT
COUNTS
THIS
IS
TRUE
I
AM
NOT
QUESTIONING
THIS
BUT
HE
WALKED
THE
EARTH
FOR
DECADES
AS
A
HUMAN
THIS
PART
OF
HIS
EXISTENCE
INTRIGUES
ME
AND
AS
FOR
SAYING
THAT
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
TO
A
MEMBER
OF
A
PHYSICALLY
EMANCIPATED
PEOPLE
WHO
IS
STILL
STRUGGLING
FOR
MENTAL
EMANCIPATION
BELIEVE
ME
IT
MATTERS
THE
GENERAL
ATTACK
ON
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THIS
GROUP
SEEMS
UNJUSTIFIED
THERE
HAS
BEEN
DISCUSSION
OF
THIS
ISSUE
IN
THE
PAST
WE
CANT
DISCUSS
EVERYTHING
AT
ONCE
SO
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
SPECIFIC
THING
HASNT
BEEN
DISCUSSED
RECENTLY
SHOULDNT
BE
TAKEN
AS
A
SIGN
OF
GENERAL
COWARDICE
ARROGANCE
OR
APATHY
IN
PAST
DISCUSSIONS
NO
ONE
HAS
BEEN
OUTRAGED
BY
SUGGESTIONS
THAT
JESUS
COULD
BE
BLACK
AND
IT
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
BY
A
FEW
SCHOLARS
BUT
THE
CONCENSUS
IS
THAT
HE
WAS
MOST
LIKELY
SEMITIC
AS
YOU
PROBABLY
KNOW
THERE
IS
A
TRADITION
THAT
PORTRAYALS
OF
JESUS
IN
ART
TENDS
TO
SHOW
HIM
AS
ONE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THUS
YOU
WOULDNT
BE
SURPRISED
TO
FIND
AFRICAN
ART
SHOWING
HIM
AS
BLACK
AND
ORIENTAL
ART
SHOWING
HIM
AS
ORIENTAL
THERE
ARE
GOOD
REASONS
RELATING
TO
CHRISTIAN
DEVOTION
TO
THINK
OF
HIM
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
ITS
ALSO
GOOD
NOW
AND
THEN
TO
HAVE
THAT
IMAGE
CHALLENGED
AND
TO
THINK
OF
JESUS
AS
BEING
A
MEMBER
OF
XXX
WHERE
XXX
IS
THE
GROUP
