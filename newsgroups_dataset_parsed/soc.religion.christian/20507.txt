RE
PROPHETIC
WARNING
TO
NEW
YORK
CITY

EVENSON
THOMAS
RANDALL
WRITES
YES
I
SUPPOSE
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
PEOPLE
MAKE
MISTAKES
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
IN
THOSE
LONG
AGO
OT
DAYS
IF
YOU
WERENT
CORRECT
IN
YOUR
PROPHECIES
PEOPLE
GOT
VERY
MAD
AND
YOU
WERE
NO
LONGER
BELIEVED
EVEN
PUT
TO
DEATH
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
OT
PROPHECY
AND
NT
PROPHECY
IN
THE
NT
IT
IS
EXPECTED
THAT
WHEN
BELIEVERS
GATHER
PEOPLE
WILL
PROPHESY
THE
PROPHECY
MUST
BE
JUDGED
COR
THERE
IS
NOTHING
ABOUT
KILLING
SOMEONE
WHO
MAKES
A
MISTAKE
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
MAKE
MISTAKES
IS
TRUE
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
MAKE
MISTAKES
WHILE
FILLED
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
IS
NOT
TRUE
WERE
THAT
TRUE
THE
ENTIRE
BIBLE
HAVING
BEEN
WRITTEN
BY
MEN
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
WOULD
BE
SUBJECT
ALSO
TO
THOSE
ERRORS
FOR
WHAT
IS
PROPHECY
BUT
LIKE
THOSE
REVELATIONS
GIVEN
IN
SCRIPTURE
SCRIPTURE
IS
SCRIPTURE
THERE
IS
NO
GIFT
OF
SCRIPTURE
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
YOU
BUT
I
KNOW
THAT
I
HAVE
MADE
MISTAKES
WHILE
FILLED
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
IF
YOU
DONT
GIVE
GRACE
TO
ALLOW
PEOPLE
TO
MAKE
MISTAKES
THEY
WILL
NEVER
GROW
IN
THE
USE
OF
THE
SPIRITUAL
GIFTS
WHEN
WE
MINISTER
IN
MY
SMALL
GROUP
I
ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE
TO
SPEAK
OUT
ANY
IMPRESSIONS
OR
IMAGES
THEY
THINK
MIGHT
BE
FROM
THE
LORD
ONLY
BY
TRYING
WILL
THEY
KNOW
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
RIGHT
OR
WRONG
AND
IN
EITHER
CASE
THEYLL
HAVE
A
BETTER
HANDLE
ON
IT
THE
NEXT
TIME
DIDNT
YOU
FALL
WHEN
YOU
WERE
LEARNING
TO
RIDE
A
BICYCLE
BUT
YOU
KEPT
ON
TRYING
AND
YOU
LEARNED
BOTH
FROM
YOUR
FAILURES
AND
YOUR
SUCCESSES
SPIRITUAL
GIFTS
ARE
NO
DIFFERENT
YOU
GET
BETTER
WITH
EXPERIENCE
WHICH
BRINGS
ME
AROUND
TO
ASKING
AN
OPEN
QUESTION
IS
THE
BIBLE
A
CLOSED
BOOK
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
IT
OKAY
FOR
US
TO
GO
AROUND
SAYING
GOD
TOLD
ME
THIS
AND
JESUS
TOLD
ME
THAT
WOULDNT
THAT
IMPLY
THAT
GOD
IS
STILL
POURING
OUT
NEW
REVELATION
TO
US
I
KNOW
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WILL
FEEL
THAT
IS
OKAY
AND
SOME
WILL
NOT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
CLOSED
CANON
WOULD
CERTAINLY
CAST
A
SHADOW
ON
CONTEMPORARY
PROPHETS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
AN
OPEN
CANON
SEEMS
TO
BE
INDICATED
SOMETIMES
THE
CANON
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
COMPLETE
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
GOD
NO
LONGER
SPEAKS
I
HAVE
HEARD
HIS
VOICE
NOT
AUDIBLY
THOUGH
SOME
HAVE
BUT
CLEARLY
NONETHELESS
IS
WHAT
I
HEARD
EQUIVALENT
TO
SCRIPTURE
NO
I
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
CONTEMPORARY
PROPHETS
CLAIM
THAT
WHAT
THEY
RECEIVE
FROM
THE
LORD
IS
ON
THE
SAME
LEVEL
AS
SCRIPTURE
ON
THE
CONTRARY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
MATURE
OBEY
THE
SCRIPTURES
BY
SUBMITTING
THEIR
PROPHECIES
TO
FELLOW
BELIEVERS
FOR
JUDGEMENT
AND
THE
MOST
RELIABLE
YARDSTICK
FOR
JUDGING
PROPHECIES
IS
CERTAINLY
THE
SCRIPTURES
THEMSELVES
THE
CANON
IS
CLOSED
BUT
GOD
IS
NOT
SILENT
ALSO
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
IS
THAT
SOME
SO
CALLED
PROPHECIES
ARE
NOTHING
NEW
BUT
RATHER
AN
INSPIRED
TRANSLATION
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
IT
RIGHT
TO
CALL
THAT
PROPHECY
MISLEADING
WOULDNT
THAT
BE
MORE
HAVING
TO
DO
WITH
KNOWLEDGE
I
KNOW
THE
GIFT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
EXCITING
TO
TALK
ABOUT
BUT
SHOULDNT
WE
CALL
A
HORSE
A
HORSE
DOES
IT
MATTER
WHAT
IT
IS
CALLED
THE
QUESTION
IS
NOT
HOW
TO
LABEL
IT
BUT
HOW
TO
RECEIVE
IT
WORDS
OF
KNOWLEDGE
INCIDENTALLY
ARE
SIMILAR
TO
PROPHECY
AND
SOMETIMES
THE
TWO
OVERLAP
BUT
GENERALLY
IT
IS
SUPERNATURAL
KNOWLEDGE
OF
SOME
FACT
THAT
COULD
NOT
BE
KNOWN
OTHERWISE
