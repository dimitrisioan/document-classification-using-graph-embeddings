re
marys
assumption
when
elizabeth
greeted
mary
elizabeth
said
something
to
the
effect
that
mary
out
of
all
women
was
blessed
if
so
it
appears
that
this
exactly
places
mary
beyond
the
sanctification
of
normal
humanity
i
remember
a
couple
of
times
when
my
exgirlfriend
said
that
she
thought
she
was
blessed
because
of
her
son
whom
she
loved
dearly
in
fact
ive
heard
people
refer
to
someone
as
being
blessed
quite
a
few
times
its
a
common
figure
of
speech
considering
that
elizabeth
was
just
another
human
i
think
this
passage
offers
nothing
towards
justifying
the
blessedness
of
mary
