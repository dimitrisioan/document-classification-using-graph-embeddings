RE
QUESTION
ABOUT
VIRGIN
MARY
D
ANDREW
BYLER
WROTE
HOWEVER
GREATLY
WE
EXTOLL
MARY
IT
IS
QUITE
OBVIOUS
THAT
SHE
IS
IN
NO
WAY
GOD
OR
EVEN
PART
OF
GOD
OR
EQUAL
TO
GOD
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
OUR
BLESSED
MOTHER
MEANT
THAT
BECAUSE
OF
HER
CLOSE
IDENTIFICATION
WITH
THE
REDEMPTIVE
WORK
OF
CHRIST
SHE
WAS
ASSUMED
NOTE
THAT
SHE
DID
NOT
ASCEND
BODY
AND
SOUL
INTO
HEAVEN
AND
IS
THUS
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
ALONG
WITH
ELIJAH
ENOCH
MOSES
MAYBE
WHO
ARE
ALREADY
PERFECTED
IN
HEAVEN
OBVIOUSLY
THE
VIRGIN
MARY
IS
FAR
SUPERIOR
IN
GLORIFICATION
TO
ANY
OF
THE
PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED
PERSONAGES
AS
I
SAID
IT
IS
A
PROVOCATIVE
THOUGHT
FROM
ANSWER
TO
JOB
THE
LOGICAL
CONSISTENCY
OF
THE
PAPAL
DECLARATION
CANNOT
BE
SURPASSED
AND
IT
LEAVES
PROTESTANTISM
WITH
THE
ODIUM
OF
BEING
NOTHING
BUT
A
MANS
RELIGION
WHICH
ALLOWS
NO
METAPHYSICAL
REPRESENTATION
OF
WOMAN
PROTESTANTISM
HAS
OBVIOUSLY
NOT
GIVEN
SUFFICIENT
ATTENTION
TO
THE
SIGNS
OF
THE
TIMES
WHICH
POINT
TO
THE
EQUALITY
OF
WOMEN
BUT
THIS
EQUALITY
REQUIRES
TO
BE
METAPHYSICALLY
ANCHORED
IN
THE
FIGURE
OF
A
DIVINE
WOMAN
THE
BRIDE
OF
CHRIST
JUST
AS
THE
PERSON
OF
CHRIST
CANNOT
BE
REPLACED
BY
AN
ORGANIZATION
SO
THE
BRIDE
CANNOT
BE
RE
PLACED
BY
THE
CHURCH
THE
FEMININE
LIKE
THE
MASCULINE
DEMANDS
AN
EQUALLY
PERSONAL
REPRESENTATION
THE
DOGMATIZING
OF
THE
ASSUMPTION
DOES
NOT
HOWEVER
ACCORDING
TO
THE
DOGMATIC
VIEW
MEAN
THAT
MARY
HAS
ATTAINED
THE
STATUS
OF
A
GODDESS
ALTHOUGH
AS
MISTRESS
OF
HEAVENAND
MEDIATRIX
SHE
IS
FUNCTIONALLY
ON
A
PAR
WITH
CHRIST
THE
KING
AND
MEDIATOR
AT
ANY
RATE
HER
POSITION
SATISFIES
THE
NEED
OF
THE
ARCHETYPE
PAR
JUNG
SHOULD
STICK
TO
PSYCHOLOGY
RATHER
THAN
GETTING
INTO
THEOLOGY
JUNG
MADE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
HE
WAS
TALKING
ABOUT
PSYCHOLOGY
NOT
THEOLOGY
HIS
COMMENTS
HAD
TO
DO
WITH
THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
IMAGE
OF
GOD
AND
ITS
FUNCTION
IN
THE
HUMAN
PSYCHE
NOT
ABOUT
THE
ACTUAL
EXISTENCE
OR
NATURE
OF
GOD
