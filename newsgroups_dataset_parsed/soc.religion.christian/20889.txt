following
christ
from
captialist
who
have
polluted
the
enviorment
in
strict
obedience
to
the
gensis
command
to
subdue
the
earth
to
nazis
who
have
justly
punished
the
jews
for
the
killing
christ
it
is
funny
how
this
one
little
quote
from
genesis
is
treated
by
certain
antichristians
as
if
christians
have
been
given
a
firm
command
to
destroy
the
earth
you
could
prove
almost
anything
by
taking
little
quotes
out
of
context
from
the
bible
its
a
big
book
you
know
i
doubt
you
could
find
a
single
case
of
a
antiecological
action
taking
place
specifically
because
teh
perpetrator
was
motivated
by
a
christian
belief
as
for
the
nazis
they
were
motivated
by
german
nationalism
not
by
christianity
in
fact
they
despised
christianity
as
a
weak
pacifist
religion
and
were
much
more
keen
on
pagan
glorification
of
strength
and
warfare
they
killed
the
jews
because
they
were
not
germans
not
because
they
were
christkillers
they
were
just
as
keen
on
killing
the
other
nongerman
ethnic
minority
the
romanies
or
gypsies
