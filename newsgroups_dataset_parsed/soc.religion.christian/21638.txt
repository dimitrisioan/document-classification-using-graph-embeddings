RE
JACOB
AND
ESAU
JEKCUNIHGOV
WRITES
I
WROTE
THAT
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
IN
ROMANS
SPEAKS
OF
GOD
AS
CHOOSING
JACOB
OVER
ESAU
AND
ADDS
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
AS
A
RESULT
OF
ANYTHING
THAT
EITHER
CHILD
HAD
DONE
SINCE
THEY
HAD
NOT
BEEN
BORN
YET
ITS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
ROMANS
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
JACOB
HAVE
I
LOVED
BUT
ESAU
HAVE
I
HATED
REFERS
NOT
TO
THE
TWO
INDIVIDUALS
BUT
RATHER
TO
THEIR
OFFSPRING
THE
TRIBE
OF
JACOB
AND
THE
TRIBE
OF
ESAU
SEE
OBADIAH
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
FACT
IF
YOU
SCAN
THROUGH
THE
OT
YOU
WILL
FIND
SIMILAR
REFERENCES
TO
THE
TWO
TRIBES
AARON
CARDENAS
