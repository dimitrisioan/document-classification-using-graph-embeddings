WRITES
ARE
ALL
TRUTHS
ALSO
ABSOLUTES
IS
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
TRUTHS
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTES
THE
ANSWER
TO
BOTH
QUESTIONS
IS
YES
AN
ABSOLUTE
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
CONSTANT
ACROSS
TIME
CULTURE
SITUATIONS
ETC
TRUE
IN
EVERY
INSTANCE
POSSIBLE
DO
YOU
AGREE
WITH
THIS
DEFINITION
YES
I
DO
AGREE
WITH
YOUR
DEFINITION
EXAMPLE
OF
WOMEN
COVERING
THEIR
HEADS
AND
NOT
SPEAKING
HOLD
IT
I
SAID
THAT
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
TRUE
HOWEVER
DISCERNING
EXACTLY
WHAT
JESUS
PAUL
AND
COMPANY
WERE
TRYING
TO
SAY
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
SO
EASY
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
PAUL
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
ALL
WOMEN
SHOULD
BEHAVE
THAT
WAY
RATHER
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
AT
THE
TIME
THE
WOMEN
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
TO
WOULD
BEST
AVOID
VOLUBILITY
AND
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
THIS
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
MAINTAINING
A
PROPER
WITNESS
TOWARD
OTHERS
REMEMBER
THAT
ANY
NUMBER
OF
RELATIVISTIC
STATEMENTS
CAN
BE
DERIVED
FROM
ABSOLUTES
FOR
INSTANCE
IT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
STRIVE
FOR
PEACE
HOWEVER
THIS
DOES
NOT
RULE
OUT
TRYING
TO
MAINTAIN
WORLD
PEACE
BY
RESORTING
TO
VIOLENCE
ON
OCCASION
YES
MY
OPINION
I
AGREE
THAT
THERE
IS
TRUTH
IN
SCRIPTURE
THERE
ARE
PRINCIPLES
TO
BE
LEARNED
FROM
IT
CLAIMING
THAT
THAT
TRUTH
IS
ABSOLUTE
THOUGH
SEEMS
TO
IMPLY
A
LITERAL
READING
OF
THE
BIBLE
IF
IT
WERE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
CONSTANT
ACROSS
TIME
CULTURE
ETC
THEN
NO
INTERPRETATION
WOULD
BE
NECESSARY
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THE
LESSONS
GLEANED
FROM
VARIOUS
PASSAGES
ARE
DIFFERENT
FROM
PERSON
TO
PERSON
TO
ME
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
ONE
PERSON
IS
RIGHT
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
WRONG
I
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
TRANSCENDS
OUR
SIMPLE
MINDS
AND
THAT
SCRIPTURE
MAY
VERY
WELL
HAVE
BEEN
CRAFTED
WITH
EXACTLY
THIS
INTENT
GOD
KNOWS
ME
AND
KNOWS
THAT
MY
NEEDS
ARE
DIFFERENT
FROM
YOURS
OR
ANYONE
ELSES
BY
CLAIMING
THAT
SCRIPTURE
IS
ABSOLUTE
THEN
AT
LEAST
ONE
PERSON
IN
EVERY
DISPUTED
INTERPRETATION
MUST
BE
WRONG
I
JUST
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
IS
THAT
RIGID
EVANGELICALS
ARE
CLEARLY
NOT
TAKING
THIS
PARTICULAR
PART
OF
SCRIPTURE
TO
BE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AND
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
OTHER
EXAMPLES
CAN
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
SURE
THE
BIBLE
PREACHES
ABSOLUTE
TRUTHS
HOWEVER
EXACTLY
WHAT
THOSE
TRUTHS
ARE
IS
SOMETIMES
A
MATTER
OF
CONFUSION
AS
I
SAID
THE
BIBLE
DOES
PREACH
ABSOLUTE
TRUTHS
SOMETIMES
THOSE
FUNDAMENTAL
PRINCIPLES
ARE
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
AT
LEAST
TO
EVANGELICALS
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
ARROGANCE
COMES
IN
TO
PLAY
SINCE
THESE
PRINCIPLES
ARE
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
TO
EVANGELICALS
MAYBE
THE
REST
OF
US
SHOULD
JUST
TAKE
THEIR
WORD
FOR
IT
MAYBE
IT
ISNT
AT
ALL
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
THEIR
FUNDAMENTAL
PRINCIPLES
ARE
EITHER
FUNDAMENTAL
OR
PRINCIPLES
I
THINK
WEVE
ESTABLISHED
THAT
FIGURING
OUT
BIBLICAL
TRUTH
IS
A
MATTER
OF
HUMAN
INTERPRETATION
AND
THEREFORE
ERRORPRONE
YET
YOU
CAN
STILL
CLAIM
THAT
SOME
OF
THEM
MAY
BE
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
MAYBE
TO
A
CERTAIN
SEGMENT
OF
CHRISTIANITY
BUT
TO
ALL
ITS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
HOW
YOU
CAN
CLAIM
SOMETHING
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
YOUR
OWN
INTERPRETATION
IS
ABSOLUTE
GOD
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTHS
TO
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
HIS
WORD
IT
IS
UTTERLY
UNAVOIDABLE
HOWEVER
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WHILL
COME
UP
WITH
ALTERNATE
INTERPRETATIONS
PRACTICALLY
ANYTHING
CAN
BE
MISINTERPRETED
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MATTERS
OF
RIGHT
AND
WRONG
CARE
TO
DENY
THAT
NOT
AT
ALL
I
THINK
IT
SUPPORTS
MY
POSITION
MUCH
MORE
EFFECTIVELY
THAN
YOURS
SO
I
THINK
THAT
YOUR
POSITION
IS
THE
BIBLE
IS
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
BUT
AS
WE
ARE
PRONE
TO
ERROR
IN
OUR
INTERPRETATION
WE
CANNOT
RELIABLY
DETERMINE
IF
WE
HAVE
FIGURED
OUT
WHAT
THAT
TRUTH
IS
DID
I
GET
THAT
RIGHT
WHATS
THE
POINT
OF
SPENDING
ALL
THIS
TIME
CLAIMING
AND
DEFENDING
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
WHEN
WE
CAN
NEVER
KNOW
WHAT
THOSE
TRUTHS
ARE
AND
WE
CAN
NEVER
OR
AT
LEAST
SHOULDNT
ACT
UPON
THEM
WHAT
PRACTICAL
DIFFERENCE
CAN
THIS
MAKE
