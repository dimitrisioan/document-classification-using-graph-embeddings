referring
to
mary
she
was
immaculately
conceived
and
so
never
subject
to
original
sin
but
also
never
committed
a
personal
sin
in
her
whole
life
this
was
possible
because
of
the
special
degree
of
grace
granted
to
her
by
god
i
have
quite
a
problem
with
the
idea
that
mary
never
committed
a
sin
was
mary
fully
human
if
it
is
possible
for
god
to
miraculously
make
a
person
free
of
original
sin
and
free
of
committing
sin
their
whole
life
then
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
incarnation
of
jesus
why
cant
god
just
repeat
the
miracle
done
for
mary
to
make
all
the
rest
of
us
sinless
without
the
need
for
repentance
and
salvation
and
all
that
i
dont
particularly
object
to
the
idea
of
the
assumption
or
the
perpetual
virginity
both
of
which
i
regard
as
catholic
dogma
about
which
i
will
agree
to
disagree
with
my
catholic
brothers
and
sisters
in
christ
and
i
even
believe
in
the
virgin
birth
of
jesus
but
this
concept
of
marys
sinlessness
seems
to
me
to
be
at
odds
with
the
rest
of
christian
doctrine
as
i
understand
it
