MICHAEL
SIEMON
WRITES
ROMANS
I
CORINTHIANS
I
TIMOTHY
JUDE
II
PETER
GEN
LEV
TO
NAME
A
FEW
OF
THE
VERSES
THAT
PERTAIN
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
HOMOSEXUAL
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
INDEED
CHECKED
OUT
THESE
VERSES
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
USED
AGAINST
US
ONLY
THROUGH
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
INTERPRETATIONS
OTHERS
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUES
YOU
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
MORE
IN
NEED
OF
A
CAREFUL
AND
SPIRITLED
COURSE
IN
EXEGESIS
THAN
MOST
OF
THE
GAY
CHRISTIANS
I
KNOW
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
STOP
PROOFTEXTING
ABOUT
THINGS
YOU
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
MICHAEL
WELL
MICHAEL
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
CLH
HAS
LEFT
THEM
IN
THE
FAQ
MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
POST
THE
HOW
TO
GET
THERE
MAP
AGAIN
BUT
I
POSTED
TWO
OR
THREE
LENGTHY
EXEGETICAL
PAPER
ON
THESE
VERSES
THEY
LOOKED
AT
THE
OT
NT
AND
INTERTESTIMENTAL
USAGES
OF
TERMS
IN
REFERENCE
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
YOU
READ
THOSE
BEFORE
YOU
TALK
ABOUT
A
NEED
IN
EXEGETICAL
STUDIES
IF
THOSE
ARENT
ENOUGH
I
COULD
ALSO
PROVIDE
THE
SOURCE
AND
NT
MEANING
OF
APSEVOKOITAI
DR
JAMES
DEYOUNG
PUBLISHED
IT
IN
THE
MASTERS
SEMINARY
JOURNAL
IN
FALL
OF
TO
READ
ANY
OF
THESE
PAPERS
SHOWS
THAT
THE
SHOE
IS
ON
THE
OTHER
FOOT
AS
FAR
AS
A
NEED
FOR
HONEST
EXEGESIS
AGAIN
PLEASE
REFER
TO
THE
FAQ
FILE
OR
IF
YOU
ARE
UNABLE
TO
ACESS
IT
DROP
ME
A
LINE
AND
I
WILL
ENCLOSE
THEM
TO
YOU
REXLEXFNALFNALGOV
THEYRE
IN
A
SEPARATE
FILE
WHICH
I
GAVE
A
POINTER
TO
IN
MY
