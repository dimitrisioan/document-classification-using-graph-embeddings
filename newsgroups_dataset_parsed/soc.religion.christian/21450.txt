GOD
MORALITY
AND
MASSACRES
WITHOUT
QUOTING
AT
LENGTH
FROM
THE
PRECEEDING
POST
ID
JUST
LIKE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
FIND
IT
A
MUCH
MORE
APPROPRIATE
WAY
OF
DEALING
WITH
ISSUES
LIKE
THE
HOLOCAUST
AND
BOSNIA
THAT
ASSERTING
THAT
GOD
IS
PUNISHING
THEM
THE
ACTIVITY
OF
GOD
IS
ALWAYS
REDEMPTIVE
WHICH
MEANS
RESTORING
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
LOST
BROKEN
OR
DISTORTED
SO
GOD
DOES
NOT
WILL
THE
BROKENNESS
LOSTNESS
DISTORTION
GENOCIDE
POVERTY
ETC
BUT
IS
NONETHELESS
CAPABLE
WILLING
AND
ACTIVE
TO
RESTORE
HEAL
MEND
AND
REDEEEM
