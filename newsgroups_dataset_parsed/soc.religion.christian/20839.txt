RE
SSPX
SCHISM
LARRY
L
OVERACKER
WRITES
RESPONDING
TO
SIMON
I
MAY
BE
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
SOME
BRIEF
SELECTIONS
POSTED
TO
THE
NET
MY
UNDERSTANDING
IS
THAT
SSPX
DOES
NOT
CONSIDER
ITSELF
IN
SCHISM
OR
LEGITIMATELY
EXCOMMUNICATED
BUT
THATS
REALLY
BESIDE
THE
POINT
WHAT
DOES
THE
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
SAY
EXCOMMUNICATION
CAN
BE
REAL
APART
FROM
FORMAL
EXCOMMUNICATION
AS
PROVIDED
FOR
IN
CANON
LAW
HERES
SOME
OF
THE
THEOLOGY
INVOLVED
FOR
THE
INTERESTED
THERE
IS
CONFUSION
OVER
THIS
ISSUE
OF
THE
SSPXS
SCHISM
OFTEN
THE
BASIC
PROBLEM
IS
LACK
OF
AN
ABILITY
TO
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
TRUE
OBEDIENCE
FALSE
OBEDIENCE
DISOBEDIENCE
SCHISM
TAKE
THE
VARIOUS
CLASSIFICATIONS
OF
OBEDIENCE
FIRST
THERE
ARE
IMPORTANT
ELEMENTS
INVOLVED
HERE
FOR
MY
PURPOSES
A
COMMAND
THE
RESPONSE
MADE
TO
THE
COMMAND
AS
FAR
AS
THE
COMMAND
GOES
COMMANDS
CAN
BE
LEGITIMATE
SUCH
AS
THE
POPE
ORDERING
CATHOLICS
TO
NOT
EAT
MEAT
ON
FRIDAYS
OR
THEY
CAN
BE
ILLEGITIMATE
SUCH
AS
THE
POPE
ORDERING
CATHOLICS
TO
WORSHIP
THE
GOD
DAGON
WHEN
EVERY
OTHER
FULL
MOON
COMES
AROUND
AS
FAR
AS
THE
RESPONSE
TO
A
COMMAND
GOES
IT
CAN
BE
TO
REFUSE
TO
DO
WHAT
IS
COMMANDED
OR
TO
COMPLY
MAKING
A
TABLE
THERE
ARE
THUS
POSSIBILITES
COMMAND
RESPONSE
NAME
LEGITIMATE
COMPLY
TRUE
OBEDIENCE
ILLEGITIMATE
REFUSE
TRUE
OBEDIENCE
LEGITIMATE
REFUSE
DISOBEDIENCE
ILLEGITIMATE
COMPLY
FALSE
OBEDIENCE
SO
NOW
YOU
SEE
WHERE
MY
CLASSIFICATIONS
OF
OBEDIENCE
COME
FROM
OBEDIENCE
IS
NOT
SOLELY
A
MATTER
OF
COMPLIANCEREFUSAL
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
COMMANDS
MUST
ALSO
BE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
CONSIDER
SOMEONES
COMPLIANCE
OR
REFUSAL
AND
THEN
SAY
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
OBEDIENT
OR
DISOBEDIENT
YOU
ALSO
HAVE
TO
TAKE
INTO
CONSIDERATION
WHETHER
THE
COMMANDS
ARE
GOOD
OR
BAD
IN
MY
EXAMPLE
IF
THE
POPE
COMMANDS
ALL
CATHOLICS
TO
WORSHIP
THE
GOD
DAGON
AND
THEY
ALL
REFUSE
THEY
ARENT
BEING
DISOBEDIENT
AT
ALL
AS
FAR
AS
THE
SOCIETY
OF
SAINT
PIUS
X
GOES
THEY
ARE
CERTAINLY
REFUSING
TO
COMPLY
WITH
CERTAIN
THINGS
THE
POPE
DESIRES
BUT
THAT
ALONE
IS
INSUFFICIENT
TO
ALLOW
ONE
TO
LABEL
THEM
DISOBEDIENT
YOU
ALSO
HAVE
TO
CONSIDER
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
PAPAL
DESIRES
AND
THERES
THE
RUB
SSPX
SAYS
THE
POPES
SINCE
VATICAN
II
HAVE
BEEN
COMMANDING
CERTAIN
VERY
BAD
THINGS
FOR
THE
CHURCH
THE
POPES
HAVE
OF
COURSE
DISAGREED
SO
WHERE
ARE
WE
ARE
WE
IN
ANOTHER
ARIAN
HERESY
COMPLETE
WITH
WEAK
POPES
OR
ARE
THE
SSPX
PRIESTS
MODERN
MARTIN
LUTHERS
WELL
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
ANSWER
THAT
IS
TO
EXAMINE
WHO
IS
SAYING
WHAT
AND
WHAT
THE
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
OF
THE
CHURCH
IS
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
THAT
VERY
FEW
CATHOLICS
HAVE
MUCH
OF
AN
IDEA
OF
WHAT
IS
REALLY
GOING
ON
AND
WHAT
THE
ISSUES
ARE
THE
RELIGION
OF
AMERICAN
CATHOLICS
IS
ESPECIALLY
DEFECTIVE
IN
INTELLECTUAL
DEPTH
YOU
WILL
NEVER
READ
ABOUT
THE
ISSUES
BEING
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
PRESS
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ONE
ITALIAN
CATHOLIC
MAGAZINE
I
GET
DAYS
HAS
HAD
INTERVIEWS
WITH
THE
SUPERIOR
GENERAL
OF
THE
SOCIETY
OF
SAINT
PIUS
X
MANY
CATHOLICS
WILL
DECIDE
TO
SIDE
WITH
THE
POPE
THERE
IS
SOME
SOUNDNESS
IN
THIS
BECAUSE
THE
PAPACY
IS
INFALLIBLE
SO
EVENTUALLY
SOME
POPE
WILL
STRAIGHTEN
ALL
THIS
OUT
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THERE
IS
ALSO
UNSOUNDNESS
IN
THIS
IN
THAT
IN
THE
SHORT
TERM
THE
POPES
MAY
INDEED
BE
WRONG
AND
SUCH
CATHOLICS
ARE
DOING
NOTHING
TO
HELP
THE
SITUATION
BY
OBEYING
THEM
WHERE
THEYRE
WRONG
IN
FACT
IF
THE
SITUATION
IS
GRAVE
ENOUGH
THEY
SIN
IN
OBEYING
HIM
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
THEYRE
WASTING
A
GREAT
OPPORTUNITY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
FAILING
TO
LOVE
CHRIST
IN
A
HEROIC
WAY
AT
THE
VERY
TIME
THAT
HE
NEEDS
THIS
BADLY
SCHISM
LETS
MOVE
ON
TO
SCHISM
WHAT
IS
IT
SCHISM
IS
A
SUPERSET
OF
DISOBEDIENCE
REFUSAL
TO
OBEY
A
LEGITIMATE
COMMAND
ALL
SCHISMATICS
ARE
DISOBEDIENT
BUT
ITS
A
SUPERSET
SO
IT
DOESNT
WORK
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
NOT
ALL
DISOBEYERS
ARE
SCHISMATICS
THE
MERE
FACT
THAT
THE
SSPX
PRIESTS
DONT
COMPLY
WITH
THE
HOLY
FATHERS
DESIRES
DOESNT
MAKE
THEM
SCHISMATICS
SO
WHAT
IS
IT
THAT
MUST
BE
ADDED
TO
DISOBEDIENCE
TO
CONSTITUTE
A
SCHISM
MAYBE
THIS
SOMETHING
ELSE
MAKES
THE
SSPX
PRIESTS
SCHISMATICS
YOU
MUST
ADD
THIS
THE
REJECTION
OF
THE
RIGHT
TO
COMMAND
LOOK
IN
ANY
DECENT
REFERENCE
ON
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGY
AND
THATS
WHAT
YOULL
FIND
THE
DISTINGUISHING
CRITERION
OF
SCHISM
IS
REJECTION
OF
THE
RIGHT
TO
COMMAND
HERES
WHAT
THE
CATHOLIC
ENCYCLOPEDIA
SAYS
FOR
EXAMPLE
NOT
EVERY
DISOBEDIENCE
IS
A
SCHISM
IN
ORDER
TO
POSSESS
THIS
CHARACTER
IT
MUST
INCLUDE
BESIDES
THE
TRANGRESSION
OF
THE
COMMANDS
OF
SUPERIORS
DENIAL
OF
THEIR
DIVINE
RIGHT
TO
COMMAND
FROM
THE
CE
ARTICLE
SCHISM
IS
THE
SOCIETY
OF
SAINT
PIUS
X
THEN
SCHISMATIC
THE
ANSWER
IS
A
CLEAR
NO
THEY
SAY
THAT
THE
POPE
IS
THEIR
BOSS
THEY
PRAY
FOR
HIM
EVERY
DAY
AND
THATS
ALL
THAT
MATTERS
AS
FAR
AS
SCHISM
GOES
WHAT
ALL
THIS
BOILS
DOWN
TO
IS
THIS
IF
WE
LEAVE
ASIDE
THE
CONSIDERATION
OF
THE
EXACT
NATURE
OF
THEIR
OBJECTIONS
THEIR
POSITION
IS
A
LEGITIMATE
ONE
AS
FAR
AS
THE
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGY
OF
OBEDIENCE
AND
SCHISM
GOES
THEY
ARE
RESISTING
CERTAIN
PAPAL
POLICIES
BECAUSE
THEY
THINK
THAT
THEY
ARE
CLEARLY
CONTRARY
TO
THE
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
OF
THE
PAPACY
AND
THE
BEST
INTERESTS
OF
THE
CHURCH
IN
FACT
SOMEONE
WHO
FINDS
HIMSELF
IN
THIS
SITUATION
HAS
A
DUTY
TO
RESIST
NOW
WHAT
IS
THE
STANCE
OF
ROME
ON
ALL
THIS
WELL
IF
YOU
READ
THE
HOLY
FATHERS
MOTU
PROPRIO
ECCLESIA
DEI
YOU
CAN
FIND
OUT
ITS
THE
DEFINITIVE
DOCUMENT
ON
THE
SUBJECT
A
MOTU
PROPRIO
IS
A
SPECIFICALLY
PAPAL
ACT
ITS
NOT
THE
PRODUCT
OF
A
ROMAN
CONGREGATION
A
LETTER
THAT
THE
POPE
HAS
POSSIBLY
NEVER
EVEN
READ
ITS
FROM
THE
POPE
HIMSELF
HIS
BOSS
IS
GOD
THERES
NO
ONE
ELSE
TO
COMPLAIN
TO
IN
THIS
DOCUMENT
THE
HOLY
FATHER
SAYS
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
THE
EPISCOPAL
CONSECRATIONS
PERFORMED
BY
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRE
CONSTITUTED
A
SCHISMATIC
ACT
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRES
PROBLEM
WAS
A
MISUNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
TRADTION
BOTH
ARE
CONFUSING
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
THE
LOGIC
OF
THE
POPES
POINTS
AS
FAR
AS
THE
EPISCOPAL
CONSECRATIONS
GO
I
READ
AN
INTERESTING
ARTICLE
IN
A
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
ITALIAN
MAGAZINE
SI
SI
NO
NO
IT
ALL
GETS
BACK
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
JURISDICTION
IF
EPISCOPAL
CONSECRATIONS
IMPLY
REJECTION
OF
THE
POPES
JURISDICTION
THEN
THEY
WOULD
TRULY
CONSTITUTE
A
SCHISMATIC
ACT
JUSTIFYING
EXCOMMUNICATION
UNDER
THE
CURRENT
CODE
OF
CANON
LAW
BUT
MY
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
IS
THIS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
TRADITIONAL
THEOLOGY
OF
HOLY
ORDERS
EPISCOPAL
CONSECRATION
DOES
NOT
CONFER
JURISDICTION
IT
ONLY
CONFERS
THE
POWER
OF
ORDER
THE
ABILITY
TO
CONFECT
THE
SACRAMENTS
JURISDICTION
MUST
BE
CONFERRED
BY
SOMEONE
ELSE
WITH
THE
POWER
TO
CONFER
IT
SUCH
AS
THE
POPE
THE
SOCIETY
BISHOPS
KNOWING
THE
TRADITIONAL
THEOLOGY
QUITE
WELL
TAKE
GREAT
PAINS
TO
AVOID
ANY
PRETENCE
OF
JURISDICTION
OVER
ANYONE
THEY
SIMPLY
CONFER
THOSE
SACRAMENTS
THAT
REQUIRE
A
BISHOP
THE
SI
SI
NO
NO
ARTICLE
WAS
INTERESTING
IN
THAT
IT
POSITED
THAT
THE
REASON
THAT
THE
POPE
SAID
WHAT
HE
DID
IS
THAT
HE
HAS
A
NOVEL
POSTVATICAN
II
IDEA
OF
HOLY
ORDERS
ACCORDING
TO
THIS
IDEA
EPISCOPAL
CONSECRATION
DOES
CONFER
JURISDICTION
I
LENT
THE
ARTICLE
TO
A
FRIEND
UNFORTUNATELY
SO
CANT
TELL
YOU
MORE
I
BELIEVE
THEY
QUOTED
THE
NEW
CODE
OF
CANON
LAW
IN
SUPPORT
OF
THIS
IDEA
THE
POPES
THINKING
ON
THIS
POINT
REMAINS
A
GREAT
PUZZLE
TO
ME
THERES
NO
WAY
THERE
IS
A
SCHISM
ACCORDING
TO
TRADITIONAL
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGY
SO
WHY
DOES
THE
POPE
THINK
THIS
AS
FAR
AS
THE
POINTS
REGARDING
THE
NATURE
OF
TRADITION
GOES
HERES
THE
PASSAGE
IN
QUESTION
THE
ROOT
OF
THIS
SCHISMATIC
ACT
CAN
BE
DISCERNED
IN
AN
INCOMPLETE
AND
CONTRADICTORY
NOTION
OF
TRADTION
INCOMPLETE
BECAUSE
IT
DOES
NOT
TAKE
SUFFICIENTLY
INTO
THE
ACCOUNT
THE
LIVING
CHARACTER
OF
TRADITION
WHICH
AS
THE
SECOND
VATICAN
COUNCIL
CLEARLY
TAUGHT
COMES
FROM
THE
APOSTLES
AND
PROGRESSES
IN
THE
CHURCH
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THERE
IS
A
GROWTH
IN
INSIGHT
INTO
THE
REALITIES
AND
WORDS
THAT
ARE
BEING
PASSED
ON
THIS
COMES
ABOUT
IN
VARIOUS
WAYS
IT
COMES
THROUGH
THE
CONTEMPLATION
AND
STUDY
OF
BELIEVERS
WHO
PONDER
THESE
THINGS
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
IT
COMES
FROM
THE
INTIMATE
SENSE
OF
SPIRITUAL
REALITIES
WHICH
THEY
EXPERIENCE
AND
IT
COMES
FROM
THE
PREACHING
OF
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
RECEIVED
ALONG
WITH
THEIR
RIGHT
OF
SUCCESSION
IN
THE
ESPISCOPATE
THE
SURE
CHARISM
OF
TRUTH
BUT
ESPECIALLY
CONTRADICTORY
IS
A
NOTION
OF
TRADITION
WHICH
OPPOSES
THE
UNIVERSAL
MAGISTERIUM
OF
THE
CHURCH
POSSESSED
BY
THE
BISHOP
OF
ROME
AND
THE
BODY
OF
BISHOPS
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
REMAIN
FAITHFUL
TO
THE
TRADITION
WHILE
BREAKING
THE
ECCLESIAL
BOND
WITH
HIM
TO
WHOM
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
THE
APOSTLE
PETER
CHRIST
HIMSELF
ENTRUSTED
THE
MINISTRY
OF
UNITY
IN
HIS
CHURCH
PAPAL
MOTU
PROPRIO
ECCLESIA
DEI
JULY
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
HOLY
FATHER
IS
MAKING
TWO
POINTS
HERE
THAT
CAN
BE
SIMPLIFIED
TO
THE
FOLLOWING
VATICAN
COUNCIL
II
HAS
HAPPENED
I
AM
THE
POPE
THE
ARGUMENT
BEING
THAT
EITHER
CASE
IS
SUFFICIENT
TO
PROVE
THAT
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRE
MUST
BE
WRONG
BECAUSE
HE
DISAGREES
WITH
THEM
THIS
IS
WEAK
TO
SAY
THE
LEAST
IT
WOULD
HAVE
HELPED
CLARIFY
THINGS
MORE
IF
THE
POPE
HAD
ADDRESSED
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRES
CONCERNS
IN
DETAIL
WHAT
IS
JOHN
PAUL
IIS
STAND
ON
THE
SOCIAL
KINGSHIP
OF
CHRIST
AS
TAUGHT
BY
GREGORY
XVI
PIUS
IX
LEO
XIII
PIUS
XI
AND
PIUS
XII
FOR
EXAMPLE
ARE
WE
SUPPOSED
TO
IGNORE
WHAT
ALL
THESE
POPES
SAID
ON
THE
SUBJECT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
FUTURE
WILL
HOLD
BUT
THE
POWERS
THAT
BE
IN
THE
SSPX
ARE
STILL
TALKING
WITH
ROME
AND
TRYING
TO
STRAIGHTEN
THINGS
OUT
MANY
PEOPLE
WOULD
PREFER
TO
CALL
A
JUSTIFIED
REFUSAL
TO
OBEY
JUSTIFIED
DISOBEDIENCE
OR
EVEN
OBEYING
GOD
RATHER
THAN
MAN
CALLING
A
REFUSAL
TO
OBEY
OBEDIENCE
PUTS
US
INTO
A
SORT
OF
ALICE
IN
WONDERLAND
WORLD
WHERE
WORDS
MEAN
WHATEVER
WE
WANT
THEM
TO
MEAN
SIMILARLY
SCHISM
INDICATES
A
FORMAL
BREAK
IN
THE
CHURCH
IF
THE
POPE
SAYS
THAT
A
SCHISM
EXISTS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
BY
DEFINITION
IT
EXISTS
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
THE
POPE
IS
ON
THE
WRONG
SIDE
OF
THE
BREAK
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
GOOD
REASON
FOR
THE
BREAK
TO
EXIST
AND
THAT
IT
WILL
SHORTLY
BE
HEALED
BUT
HOW
CAN
ONE
DENY
THAT
IT
DOES
IN
FACT
EXIST
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
ARE
IN
GRAVE
DANGER
OF
DESTROYING
THE
THING
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
REFORM
THE
POWER
OF
THE
PAPACY
WHAT
GOOD
WILL
IT
DO
YOU
IF
YOU
BECOME
RECONCILED
TO
THE
THE
POPE
IN
THE
FUTURE
BUT
IN
THE
PROCESS
YOU
HAVE
DESTROYED
HIS
ABILITY
TO
USE
THE
TOOLS
OF
CHURCH
DISCIPLINE
ITS
ONE
THING
TO
HOLD
THAT
THE
POPE
HAS
MISUSED
HIS
POWERS
AND
EXCOMMUNICATED
SOMEONE
WRONGLY
ITS
SOMETHING
ELSE
TO
SAY
THAT
HIS
EXCOMMUNICATION
DID
NOT
TAKE
EFFECT
AND
THE
SCHISM
IS
ALL
IN
HIS
IMAGINATION
THAT
MEANS
THAT
ACTS
OF
CHURCH
DISCIPLINE
ARE
NOT
LEGAL
TOOLS
BUT
ACTS
WHOSE
VALIDITY
IS
OPEN
TO
DEBATE
GENERALLY
IT
HAS
BEEN
LIBERAL
CATHOLICS
WHO
HAVE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
POPE
WHILE
THEY
HAVE
OFTEN
OBJECTED
TO
CHURCH
SANCTIONS
GENERALLY
THEY
HAVE
ADMITTED
THAT
THE
SANCTIONS
EXIST
YOU
ARE
NOW
OPENING
THE
DOOR
TO
PEOPLE
SIMPLY
IGNORING
PAPAL
DECISIONS
CLAIMING
TO
BE
TRULY
OBEYING
BY
DISOBEYING
AND
TO
BE
IN
COMMUNION
WHILE
EXCOMMUNICATED
THIS
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
PRECISELY
THE
DENIAL
OF
DIVINE
RIGHT
TO
COMMAND
THAT
YOU
SAY
DEFINES
SCHISM
CLH
