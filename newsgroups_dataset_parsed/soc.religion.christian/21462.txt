VIRGIN
MARY

D
ANDREW
KILLE
WRITES
JUST
AN
OBSERVATION
ALTHOUGH
THE
BODILY
ASSUMPTION
HAS
NO
BASIS
IN
THE
BIBLE
CARL
JUNG
DECLARED
IT
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
PRONOUNCEMENTS
OF
THE
CHURCH
IN
RECENT
YEARS
IN
THAT
IT
IMPLIED
THE
INCLUSION
OF
THE
FEMININE
INTO
THE
GODHEAD
JUNG
MAY
HAVE
SAID
THAT
BUT
HE
WAS
IN
NO
WAY
SPEAKING
FOR
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
THE
DOGMA
OF
THE
ASSUMPTION
IN
NO
WAY
MEANS
MARY
IS
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
GOD
OR
PART
OF
THE
GODHEAD
THEREFORE
IT
IMPLIES
NO
SUCH
THING
ABOUT
THE
FEMININE
IN
GENERAL
ALSO
JUNGS
STATEMENT
MAKES
IT
SOUND
AS
THOUGH
THE
DOGMA
WAS
ANNOUNCED
OUT
OF
THE
BLUE
THIS
ALSO
IS
INCORRECT
AS
DOGMA
IS
ONLY
THE
FORMULATION
OF
WHAT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
PART
OF
TRADITION
THIS
DOGMA
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
BELIEVED
BUT
WAS
NOT
FORMALLY
DEFINED
UNTIL
THE
ASSUMPTION
WAS
DECLARED
AS
AN
EX
CATHEDRA
