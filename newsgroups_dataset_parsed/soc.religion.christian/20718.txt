YOU
ARE
ASKING
ME
TO
PROVIDE
OBJECTIVE
PROOF
FOR
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
I
NEVER
CLAIMED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
THIS
IN
FACT
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
SO
I
CONSIDER
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
TO
BE
A
PREMISE
OR
ASSUMPTION
THAT
UNDERLIES
MY
PHILOSOPHY
OF
LIFE
IT
COMES
DOWN
TO
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
IF
I
WERENT
A
CHRISTIAN
I
WOULD
BE
AN
AGNOSTIC
BUT
I
HAVE
SUFFICIENT
SUBJECTIVE
EVIDENCE
TO
JUSTIFY
AND
SUSTAIN
MY
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
AGAIN
THIS
IS
A
MATTER
OF
PREMISES
AND
ASSUMPTIONS
I
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
IS
MORE
TO
LIFE
THE
UNIVERSE
AND
EVERYTHING
THAN
MATERIALISM
IE
THAT
SPIRITUALITY
EXISTS
THIS
ASSUMPTION
ANSWERS
THE
QUESTION
ABOUT
WHY
I
HAVE
APPARENT
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
I
FIND
THIS
ASSUMPTION
CONSISTENT
WITH
MY
SUBSEQUENT
OBSERVAT
IONS
I
THEN
FIND
THAT
GOD
FILLS
THESE
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
BUT
I
CANNOT
OBJECTIVELY
PROVE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
APPARENT
FILLING
OF
IMAGINED
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
AND
REAL
FILLING
OF
REAL
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
NOR
CAN
I
PROVE
TO
ANOTHER
PERSON
THAT
THEY
HAVE
SPIRITUAL
