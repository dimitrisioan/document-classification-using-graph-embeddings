RE
CHRISTIANITY
AND
REPEATED
LIVES
IN
ARTICLE
SMAYOWORLDSTDCOM
SC
OTT
A
MAYO
WRITES
GERRY
PALO
WRITES
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
PRECLUDES
THE
IDEA
OF
REPEATED
LIVES
ON
EARTH
DOESNT
IT
SAY
SOMEWHERE
IT
IS
APPOINTED
TO
MAN
ONCE
TO
DIE
AND
THEN
JUDGEMENT
I
DONT
HAVE
A
CONCORDANCE
HERE
BUT
I
HAVE
SOME
DIM
MEMORY
THAT
THIS
APPEARS
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
GIVEN
A
FAIRLY
SPECIFIC
CONTEXT
FOR
WHAT
JUDGEMENT
IS
ID
SAY
THAT
MORE
OR
LESS
DECIDES
THE
ISSUE
HEB
CLH
INDEED
THE
IMMEDIATE
CONTEXT
NASB
IS
OTHERWISE
HE
WOULD
HAVE
NEEDED
TO
SUFFER
OFTEN
SINCE
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
WORLD
BUT
NOW
ONCE
AT
THE
CONSUMMATION
HE
HAS
BEEN
MANIFESTED
TO
PUT
AWAY
SIN
BY
THE
SACRIFICE
OF
HIMSELF
AND
INASMUCH
AS
IT
IS
APPOINTED
FOR
MEN
TO
DIE
ONCE
AND
AFTER
THIS
COMES
JUDGEMENT
SO
CHRIST
ALSO
HAVING
BEEN
OFFERED
ONCE
TO
BEAR
THE
SINS
OF
MANY
SHALL
APPEAR
A
SECOND
TIME
NOT
TO
BEAR
SIN
TRO
THOSE
WHO
EAGERLY
AWAIT
HIM
THE
FIRST
POINT
IS
THAT
THIS
VERSE
IS
PART
OF
AN
EVEN
LARGER
CONTEXT
THE
SUBJECT
OF
WHICH
IS
NOT
THE
DESTINY
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
HUMAN
SOUL
BUT
RATHER
THE
SINGULAR
NATURE
OF
CHRISTS
SACRIFICE
ONCE
AND
THE
FULFILLMENT
OF
THE
LAW
FOR
ALL
OF
FALLEN
MANKIND
RUDOLF
FRIELING
ELABORATES
THIS
IN
DETAIL
IN
HIS
CHRISTIANITY
AND
REINCARNATION
THE
THRUST
OF
THE
PASSAGE
IN
ITS
CONTEXT
IS
TO
LIKEN
THE
ONE
TIME
INCARNATION
AND
SACRIFICE
OF
CHRIST
FOR
ALL
MANKIND
TO
THE
INDIVIDUAL
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING
AFTER
DEATH
THE
ONCE
IS
REPEATED
AND
EMPHASIZED
AND
IT
HIGHLIGHTS
THE
SINGULARITY
OF
CHRISTS
DEED
ONE
THING
FOR
CERTAIN
IT
DOES
IS
TO
REFUTE
THE
CLAIMS
OF
SOME
THAT
CHRIST
INCARNATES
MORE
THAN
ONCE
BUT
THE
COMPARISON
TO
THE
HUMAN
EXPERIENCE
DIE
ONCE
THEN
JUDGEMENT
NOTE
NOT
THE
JUDGEMENT
BUT
JUST
JUDGEMENT
THE
WORD
FOR
JUDGEMENT
IS
KRISIS
HEBREWS
IS
THE
ONE
PASSAGE
MOST
OFTEN
QUOTED
IN
DEFENSE
OF
THE
DOCTRINE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
DENIES
REINCARNATION
AT
THIS
POINT
I
WOULD
JUST
EMPHASIZE
AGAIN
THAT
THE
PASSAGES
THAT
ARGUABLY
SPEAK
AGAINST
IT
ARE
FEW
AND
THAT
INVARIABLY
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
SOMETHING
ELES
AND
THE
APPARENT
DENIAL
OF
REINCARNATION
IS
EITHER
INFERRED
OR
AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
HEBREWS
TAKEN
LITERALLY
AND
DEPOSITED
INTO
AN
IMPLIED
CONTEXT
NAMELY
A
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
DESTINY
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING
AFTER
DEATH
WHAT
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
SERIOUSLY
IS
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
ESSENTIALLY
SILENT
ABOUT
THE
FATE
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
HUMAN
BEING
BETWEEN
DEATH
AND
THE
LAST
DAY
IF
YOU
TAKE
THE
FEW
PASSAGES
THAT
COULD
POSSIBLY
BE
INTERPRETED
TO
MEAN
A
SINGLE
EARTH
LIFE
THEY
ARE
ARGUABLE
AND
THERE
ARE
OTHER
PASSAGES
THAT
POINT
ARGUABLY
IN
THE
OTHER
DIREC
TION
SUCH
AS
MATTHEW
AND
JOHN
WE
CAN
CONTINUE
TO
DEBATE
THE
INDIVIDUAL
SCRAPS
OF
SCRIPTURE
THAT
MIGHT
HAVE
A
BEARINIG
ON
THIS
AND
INDEED
WE
SHOULD
DISCUSS
THEM
BUT
WHAT
I
WANTED
TO
INTRODUCE
INTO
THE
DISCUSSION
WAS
AN
APPROACH
TO
THE
IDEA
OF
REPEATED
EARTH
LIVES
THAT
UNLIKE
HINDU
BUDDHIST
AND
NEW
AGE
TEACHINGS
TAKES
FULL
COGNIZANCE
OF
THE
DIVINITY
SINGULAR
INCARNATION
DEATH
BURIAL
RESURRECTION
AND
SECOND
COMING
OF
CHRIST
AS
THE
SAVIOR
OF
MANKIND
THE
ACCOUNTABILITY
OF
EACH
INDIVIDUAL
FOR
HIS
DEEDS
AND
THE
REALITY
OF
THE
FALL
AND
OF
SIN
AND
ITS
CONSEQUENCES
THE
REDEMPTION
OF
MAN
FROM
SIN
THROUGH
CHRIST
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
BODY
AND
THE
LAST
JUDGEMENT
TAKEN
IN
THIS
LARGER
SENSE
MANY
SERIOUS
QUESTIONS
TAKE
ON
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVE
EG
THE
DESTINY
OF
THOSE
WHO
DIED
IN
THEIR
SINS
BEFORE
CHRIST
CAME
THE
RELATIONSHIP
OF
FAITH
AND
GRACE
TO
WORKS
THE
MEANING
OF
DEATHBED
CONVERSION
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
SACRAMENTS
AND
MANY
OTHER
THINGS
NOT
THAT
I
PROPOSE
TO
ANSWER
ALL
THOSE
QUESTIONS
BY
A
SIMPLE
DOCTRINE
OF
CONVENIENCE
BUT
ONLY
THAT
THE
DISCUSSION
TAKES
ON
A
DIFFERENT
DIMENSION
AND
IN
MY
OPINION
ONE
THAT
IS
TRULY
WORTHY
OF
BOTH
MAN
THE
EARTH
AND
THEIR
CREATOR
AND
REDEEMER
THERE
ARE
MANY
DEEP
QUESTIONS
THAT
CONTINUE
TO
BE
DEEP
SUCH
AS
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
SECOND
DEATH
AND
HOW
THE
WHOLE
OF
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
WOULD
APPLY
TO
THIS
LARGER
PERSPECTIVE
OF
HUMAN
EXISTENCE
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
DEEPLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
THINGS
OF
WHICH
THE
BIBLE
DOES
NOT
SPEAK
ARE
NOT
THINGS
WE
SHOULD
BE
CONCERNED
WITH
BUT
CHRIST
ALSO
INDICATED
THAT
THERE
WERE
OTHER
THINGS
THAT
WE
WOULD
COME
TO
KNOW
IN
THE
FUTURE
INCLUDING
THINGS
THAT
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
THEREFORE
OTHERS
COULD
NOT
BEAR
YET
THIS
IDEA
THAT
THE
HUMAN
CAPACITY
FOR
GROWTH
IN
KNOWLEDGE
NOT
ONLY
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
IN
ONE
LIFETIME
BUT
OF
THE
WHOLE
OF
HUMANITY
ALSO
TAKES
ON
GREAT
MEANING
WHEN
WE
REALIZE
THAT
OUR
GROWTH
IN
THE
SPIRIT
IS
A
LONG
TERM
PROCESS
THE
BIBLE
WAS
NOT
MEANT
TO
CODIFY
ALL
SPIRITUAL
KNOWLEDGE
IN
ONE
PLACE
FOREVER
BUT
TO
PROCLAIM
THE
GOSPEL
OF
THE
INCARNATION
AND
REDEEMING
DEED
OF
CHRIST
TAKING
THE
GOSPEL
IN
THE
GREATER
CONTEXT
FROM
GENESIS
TO
REVELATION
NOW
SALVATION
HEALING
BECOMES
NOT
THE
END
OF
MANS
SOJOURN
BUT
ITS
BEGINNING
AND
THE
LAST
JUDGEMENT
AND
THE
NEW
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
THAT
FOLLOW
IT
BECOME
ITS
FULFULLMENT
