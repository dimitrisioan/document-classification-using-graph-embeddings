RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
ID
LIKE
TO
SHARE
MY
THOUGHTS
ON
THIS
TOPIC
OF
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
AND
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
ANY
RESPONSES
IN
MY
ENCOUNTERS
WITH
CHRISTIANS
I
FIND
MYSELF
DISMAYED
BY
THEIR
BELIEF
THAT
THEIR
FAITH
IS
TOTAL
TRUTH
ACCORDING
TO
THEM
THEIR
BELIEFS
COME
FROM
THE
BIBLE
AND
THE
BIBLE
IS
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
GOD
IS
TRUTH
THUS
THEY
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
THIS
STANCE
MAKES
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
DISCUSS
OTHER
FAITHS
WITH
THEM
AND
MY
OWN
HESITATIONS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
BECAUSE
THEY
SEE
NO
OTHER
WAY
THEIR
WAY
IS
THE
TRUTH
BUT
I
SEE
THEIR
FAITH
ARISING
FROM
A
WILLFUL
CHOICE
TO
BELIEVE
A
PARTICULAR
WAY
THAT
CHOICE
IS
PART
FAITH
AND
PART
REASON
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
A
CHOICE
MY
DISCUSSIONS
WITH
SOME
CHRISTIANS
REMIND
ME
OF
SCHOOLYARD
DISCUSSIONS
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
GRADE
SCHOOL
A
KID
WOULD
SAY
ALL
POLICEMEN
ARE
JERKS
ID
ASK
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
BECAUSE
MY
DADDY
TOLD
ME
SO
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
YOURE
DADDY
IS
RIGHT
HE
SAYS
HES
ALWAYS
RIGHT
WELL
THE
ARGUMENT
USUALLY
STOPS
RIGHT
THERE
IN
THE
END
ARENT
WE
ALL
JUST
KIDS
GROPING
FOR
THE
TRUTH
IF
SO
DO
WE
HAVE
THE
AUTHORITY
TO
DECLARE
ALL
OTHER
BELIEFS
BESIDES
OUR
OWN
AS
FALSE
THIS
IS
ONLY
MY
THIRD
TIME
BROWSING
THROUGH
THIS
NEWSGROUP
I
APOLOGIZE
IF
IM
COVERING
TIRED
OLD
GROUND
SOME
OF
THE
DISCUSSIONS
ON
THIS
TOPIC
HAVE
PIQUED
MY
INTEREST
AND
I
WELCOME
ANY

IM
SORT
OF
MYSTIFIED
ABOUT
HOW
A
CHRISTIAN
MIGHT
RESPOND
TO
THIS
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
CRITICISMS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
SAY
THERES
NOT
ENOUGH
EVIDENCE
TO
BELIEVE
IT
OR
THAT
THERES
JUST
AS
GOOD
EVIDENCE
FOR
OTHER
RELIGIONS
I
DONT
AGREE
BUT
CLEARLY
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
FIND
THE
EVIDENCE
CONVINCING
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
YOUR
POINT
RATHER
YOU
SEEM
UPSET
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO
BELIEVE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
TRUE
ALSO
BELIEVE
THAT
THINGS
WHICH
CONTRADICT
IT
ARE
FALSE
THIS
SUGGESTS
A
MODEL
OF
SPIRITUAL
THINGS
THATS
RATHER
DIFFERENT
THAN
THE
CHRISTIAN
ONE
IT
SOUNDS
MORE
LIKE
AN
EXISTENTIALIST
VIEW
WHERE
PEOPLE
CHOOSE
WHAT
VALUE
TO
FOLLOW
BUT
THERES
NO
ACTUAL
INDEPENDENT
SPIRITUAL
REALITY
AND
SO
NO
WAY
TO
SAY
THAT
A
SPECIFIC
CHOICE
IS
IN
SOME
UNIQUE
SENSE
RIGHT
THIS
SORT
OF
MODEL
WITH
MODIFICATIONS
OF
ONE
SORT
OR
ANOTHER
MAY
BE
APPROPRIATE
FOR
SOME
RELIGIONS
BUT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
IN
ITS
ESSENSE
A
HISTORICAL
RELIGION
THAT
IS
ITS
BASED
ON
THE
CONCEPT
THAT
THERE
ARE
ACTUAL
SPIRITUAL
ENTITIES
OUT
THERE
THAT
ONE
OF
THEM
HAS
INTERVENED
IN
HISTORY
IN
SPECIFIC
WAYS
AND
THAT
WE
SEE
EVIDENCE
OF
THAT
IN
HISTORY
IN
THE
MUNDANE
WORLD
WE
ARE
NOT
FREE
TO
CHOOSE
HOW
THINGS
WORK
WHEN
WE
DROP
SOMETHING
IT
FALLS
ASIDE
FROM
WELLDEFINED
SITUATIONS
WHERE
IT
DOESNT
THE
CHRISTIAN
CONCEPT
IS
THAT
SPIRITUAL
MATTERS
THERE
IS
ALSO
AN
ACTUAL
EXTERNAL
REALITY
I
HOPE
WERE
ALL
HONEST
ENOUGH
NOT
TO
CLAIM
THAT
WE
HAVE
PERFECT
UNDERSTANDING
BUT
WHILE
WE
MAY
NOT
THINK
WE
KNOW
EVERYTHING
WE
ARE
CONFIDENT
THAT
WE
KNOW
SOME
THINGS
AND
THAT
IMPLIES
THAT
WE
THINK
THINGS
THAT
CONTRADICT
THEM
ARE
FALSE
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
ELSE
WE
COULD
PROCEED
THIS
NEEDNT
RESULT
IN
ARROGANCE
IM
CERTAINLY
INTERESTED
IN
TALKING
WITH
PEOPLE
OF
OTHER
RELIGIONS
THEY
MAY
HAVE
THINGS
TO
TEACH
ME
AND
EVEN
IF
THEY
DONT
I
RESPECT
THEM
AS
FELLOW
HUMAN
BEINGS
BUT
ITS
GOT
TO
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
RESPECT
PEOPLE
AND
ALSO
THINK
THAT
ON
SOME
MATTERS
THEY
ARE
WRONG
MAYBE
EVEN
DISASTEROUSLY
WRONG
