RE
DREAMS
AND
OUT
OF
BODY
INCIDENTS
EVER
SINCE
I
WAS
A
KID
AND
LEARNED
TO
TELL
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
A
DREAM
I
HAVE
USED
MY
DREAMS
FOR
FANTASIES
OR
WORKING
OUT
PROBLEMS
IN
MY
DREAMS
I
HAVE
DONE
EVERYTHING
FROM
YELL
AT
MY
MOM
TO
MACHINEGUNNING
ZOMBIES
NOT
TO
MENTION
MYRIAD
SEXUAL
FANTASIES
I
HAVE
DELIBERATELY
DONE
THINGS
THAT
I
WOULD
NEVER
DO
IN
REAL
LIFE
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
NEED
TO
CONTROL
ONES
THOUGHTS
BUT
I
ALWAYS
FELT
THAT
DREAMS
WERE
FORMAT
FREE
NO
MORALS
NO
ETHICS
NO
PHYSICAL
LAWS
THOUGH
SOMETIMES
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
WAKE
MYSELF
UP
TO
GO
TO
THE
BATHROOM
IS
THIS
AN
INCORRECT
ATTITUDE
RATHER
THAN
WEAKENING
MY
INHIBITIONS
I
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
I
GOT
CERTAIN
THINGS
OUT
OF
MY
SYSTEM
BY
EXPERIENCING
THEM
IN
DREAMS
BY
ANALYZING
A
DREAM
I
CAN
DETERMINE
IF
I
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
A
CERTAIN
SITUATION
IE
IN
A
DREAM
SOMETHING
WILL
BE
EXAGERATED
THAT
I
CAN
THEN
CONTEMPLATE
AND
SEE
IF
IT
REALLY
BOTHERS
ME
OR
NOT
I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
DONT
DO
THE
SAME
IT
SEEMS
SILLY
TO
ATTACH
MORAL
SIGNIFICANCE
TO
DREAMS
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
FROM
OUT
OF
BODY
EXPERIENCES
WHICH
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
CONTRADICTIONS
