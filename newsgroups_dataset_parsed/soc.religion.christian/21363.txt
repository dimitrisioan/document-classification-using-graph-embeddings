WRITES
ONE
THING
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IS
WHY
BEING
SACRED
SHOULD
MAKE
THE
TEMPLE
RITUALS
SECRET
THE
SO
SACRED
ITS
SECRET
EXPLANATION
IS
A
BIT
MISLEADING
WHILE
THERE
IS
A
PROFOUND
REVERENCE
FOR
THE
TEMPLE
ENDOWMENT
THERE
IS
NO
INJUNCTION
AGAINST
DISCUSSING
THE
CEREMONY
ITSELF
IN
PUBLIC
BUT
SINCE
PUBLIC
DISCUSSION
IS
OFTEN
IRREVERENT
MOST
MORMONS
WOULD
RATHER
KEEP
SILENT
THAN
HAVE
A
CHERISHED
PRACTICE
MALIGNED
BUT
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
ELEMENTS
OF
THE
CEREMONY
WHICH
PARTICIPANTS
EXPLICITLY
COVENANT
NOT
TO
REVEAL
EXCEPT
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
THE
CEREMONY
ITSELF
GRANTED
THE
GNOSTIC
CHRISTIANS
HAD
THEIR
SECRET
RITUALS
BUT
THESE
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
TAKEN
ENTIRELY
FROM
PAGAN
PRECHRISTIAN
MYSTERY
RELIGIONS
THERE
ARE
OTHER
INTERPRETATIONS
TO
CHRISTIAN
HISTORY
IN
THIS
MATTER
ONE
MUST
RECALL
THAT
MOST
OF
WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
GNOSTICS
WAS
WRITTEN
BY
THEIR
ENEMIES
EUSEBIUS
CLAIMS
THAT
JESUS
IMPARTED
SECRET
INFORMATION
TO
PETER
JAMES
AND
JOHN
AFTER
HIS
RESURRECTION
AND
THAT
THOSE
APOSTLES
TRANSMITTED
THAT
INFORMATION
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
TWELVE
EUSEBIUS
HISTORIA
ECCLESIASTICA
II
IRENAEUS
CLAIMS
THIS
INFORMATION
WAS
PASSED
ON
TO
THE
PRIESTS
AND
BISHOPS
AGAINST
HERESIES
IV
BUT
EUSEBIUS
DISAGREES
HE
CLAIMS
THE
SECRET
CEREMONIES
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
PERISHED
WITH
THE
APOSTLES
INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH
EUSEBIUS
REFERS
TO
THE
GROUPS
WHICH
WE
TODAY
CALL
GNOSTICS
AS
PROMULGATORS
OF
A
FALSE
GNOSIS
EUSEBIUS
OP
CIT
III
HIS
GRIPE
WAS
NOT
THAT
THAY
PROFESSED
A
GNOSIS
BUT
THAT
THEY
HAD
THE
WRONG
ONE
WRITINGS
DEALING
WITH
JESUS
POSTRESURRECTION
TEACHINGS
EMPHASIZE
SECRECY
NOT
SO
MUCH
A
CONCEALMENT
AS
A
POLICY
OF
NOT
TEACHING
CERTAIN
THINGS
INDISCRIMINATELY
IN
ONE
STORY
SIMON
MAGUS
OPENS
A
DIALOG
WITH
PETER
ON
THE
NATURE
OF
GOD
PETERS
RESPONSE
IS
YOU
SEEM
TO
ME
NOT
TO
KNOW
WHAT
A
FATHER
AND
A
GOD
IS
BUT
I
COULD
TELL
YOU
BOTH
WHENCE
SOULS
ARE
AND
WHEN
AND
HOW
THEY
WERE
MADE
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
PERMITTED
TO
ME
NOW
TO
DISCLOSE
THESE
THINGS
TO
YOU
CLEMENTINE
RECOGNITIONS
II
IF
ANY
ONE
THEME
UNDERLIES
THE
RECOGNITIONS
IT
IS
THE
IDEA
THAT
CERTAIN
DOCTRINES
ARE
NOT
TO
BE
IDLY
TAUGHT
BUT
CAN
BE
HAD
AFTER
A
CERTAIN
LEVEL
OF
SPIRITUAL
MATURITY
IS
REACHED
NOW
ONE
CAN
APPROACH
THIS
AND
OTHER
SUCH
EVIDENCE
IN
MANY
WAYS
I
DONT
INTEND
THAT
EVERYONE
INTERPRET
CHRISTIAN
HISTORY
AS
I
DO
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
EVIDENCE
EXISTS
FAVORABLY
INTERPRETED
OF
COURSE
OF
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
RITES
ANALOGOUS
TO
THOSE
PRACTICED
BY
MORMONS
TODAY
NEITHER
NEW
TESTAMENT
CHRISTIANITY
NOR
BIBLICAL
JUDAISM
MADE
A
SECRET
OF
THEIR
PRACTICES
BUT
IF
JUDAISM
AND
CHRISTIANITY
HAD
SUCH
CEREMONIES
WOULD
YOU
EXPECT
TO
READ
ABOUT
THEM
IN
PUBLIC
DOCUMENTS
ONE
CAN
SEARCH
THE
BOOK
OF
MORMON
AND
OTHER
MORMON
SCRIPTURE
AND
FIND
ALMOST
NO
INFORMATION
ON
TEMPLE
WORSHIP
YES
YOU
COULD
ESTABLISH
THAT
MORMONS
WORSHIP
IN
TEMPLES
BUT
YOU
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
HARD
PRESSED
TO
CHARACTERIZE
THAT
WORSHIP
ON
THAT
BASIS
CAN
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
EXPLAINS
ALL
PRACTICES
WHICH
MIGHT
HAVE
TAKEN
PLACE
AND
THAT
ABSENCE
OF
SUCH
DESCRIPTIONS
PROVES
THEY
DID
NOT
EXIST
MORMON
SCHOLAR
DR
HUGH
NIBLEY
OFFERS
US
A
LIST
OF
SCRIPTURES
FROM
WHICH
I
HAVE
TAKEN
A
FEW
IT
IS
GIVEN
UNTO
YOU
TO
KNOW
THE
MYSTERIES
OF
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
BUT
TO
THEM
IT
IS
NOT
GIVEN
MATT
ALL
MEN
CANNOT
RECEIVE
THIS
SAYING
SAVE
THEY
TO
WHOM
IT
IS
GIVEN
MATT
I
HAVE
YET
MANY
THINGS
TO
SAY
UNTO
YOU
BUT
YE
CANNOT
BEAR
THEM
NOW
JOHN
THE
TIME
COMETH
WHEN
I
SHALL
NO
MORE
SPEAK
UNTO
YOU
IN
PROVERBS
BUT
I
SHALL
SHEW
YOU
PLAINLY
OF
THE
FATHER
JOHN
UNSPEAKABLE
WORDS
WHICH
IT
IS
NOT
LAWFUL
FOR
A
MAN
TO
UTTER
COR
MANY
THINGS
I
WOULD
NOT
WRITE
WITH
PAPER
AND
INK
BUT
I
COME
UNTO
YOU
AND
SPEAK
FACE
TO
FACE
JN
NIBLEY
SINCE
CUMORAH
PP
AGAIN
THESE
CAN
ALSO
BE
INTERPRETED
MANY
DIFFERENT
WAYS
I
BELIEVE
THEY
SERVE
TO
SHOW
THAT
NOT
ALL
DOCTRINES
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
TAUGHT
WERE
ACTUALLY
TAUGHT
OPENLY
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
JOSEPH
SMITH
TOOK
THE
ENTIRE
PRACTICE
IE
BOTH
THE
RITUAL
AND
THE
SECRECY
SURROUNDING
THE
RITUAL
FROM
THE
FREEMASONS
ANYBODY
IN
THE
KNOW
HAVE
ANY
AUTHORITATIVE
INFORMATION
ON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THIS
CLAIM
IS
TRUE
HISTORICALLY
JOSEPH
SMITH
HAD
BEEN
ADIMINISTERING
THE
TEMPLE
ENDOWMENT
CEREMONY
FOR
NEARLY
A
YEAR
BEFORE
JOINING
THE
FREEMASONS
THERE
IS
DIARY
EVIDENCE
WHICH
SUPPORTS
A
CLAIM
THAT
THE
RITE
DID
NOT
CHANGE
AFTER
SMITH
BECAME
A
MASON
IT
CAN
BE
ARGUED
THAT
SMITH
HAD
AMPLE
EXPOSURE
TO
MASONIC
PROCEEDINGS
THROUGH
THE
BURLESQUE
OF
HIS
TIME
AND
THROUGH
HIS
BROTHER
HYRUM
A
MASON
THOUGH
NO
SPECIFIC
CONNECTION
HAS
YET
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
MY
CONVERSATIONS
WITH
MASONS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
TEMPLE
RITE
TRANSCRIPTIONS
WHICH
HAVE
APPEARED
ON
THE
NET
HAVE
LED
ME
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CONNECTION
FROM
MASONRY
TO
MORMONISM
IS
FAIRLY
TENUOUS
AS
OUR
MODERATOR
NOTES
MOST
OF
WHAT
WAS
SIMILAR
WAS
REMOVED
IN
THE
RECENT
REVISIONS
TO
THE
TEMPLE
CEREMONY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
CRITICS
WHO
CHARGE
THAT
MORMON
RITES
WERE
LIFTED
FROM
FREEMASONRY
DO
NOT
HAVE
ADEQUATE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
RITES
