INFO
NEEDED
OK
LET
ME
SEE
IF
I
CAN
GET
ALL
THIS
OUT
CONCISELY
I
AM
ON
AN
INFORMATION
GATHERING
VENTURE
REGARDING
THE
VARIOUS
EXPRESSIONS
OF
CHRISTIANITYCHURCHES
THERE
ARE
MY
HUSBAND
AND
I
COME
FROM
VERY
DIFFERENT
BUT
COMPLETELY
CHRISTIAN
BACKGROUNDS
I
WAS
A
LUTHERAN
WHEN
I
MET
HIM
AND
HE
WAS
A
BORN
AND
RAISED
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
MEMBER
AT
FIRST
I
AGREED
WITH
A
LOT
OF
WHAT
THE
C
OF
C
WAS
ABOUT
I
WANTED
TO
MOVE
FROM
THE
LITURGICAL
BASED
LUTHERAN
CHURCH
TO
SOMETHING
A
LITTLE
MORE
BIBLICAL
BASED
HOWEVER
OVER
THE
LAST
YEAR
IVE
BEEN
REGRETTING
CHANGING
TO
THE
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
FOR
ONE
THING
I
AM
NOT
A
FUNDAMENTALIST
AND
BELIEVE
THAT
A
FEW
THINGS
IN
THE
BIBLE
ARE
SOCIOCULTURAL
IN
NATURE
AND
DONT
RELATE
TO
THE
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
ONE
OF
MY
SOREST
SPOTS
IS
THE
ROLE
OF
WOMEN
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THROUGH
MARY
AND
OTHER
WOMEN
CHRIS
VALIDATED
WOMEN
AS
WORTHY
DISCIPLES
BUT
IN
THE
C
OF
C
THE
WRITINGS
OF
PAUL
ARE
TAKEN
WITHOUT
EXCEPTION
AND
I
AM
TOLD
THAT
I
AM
NOT
AN
EQUAL
PARTNER
IN
MY
MARRIAGE
BUT
THE
LESSER
MEMBER
I
AM
TO
SUBMIT
TO
MY
HUSBAND
IN
ALL
THINGS
IF
I
HEAR
THAT
VERSE
ONE
MORE
TIME
AND
I
AM
NOT
TO
TAKE
AN
ACTIVE
ROLE
IN
ANYTHING
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
CONSTRUED
AS
PUTTING
ME
IN
AUTHORITY
OVER
MEN
IE
LEADING
PRAYERS
CONDUCTING
BIBLE
STUDIES
ETC
THE
LAST
STRAW
WAS
WHEN
THE
ELDERS
AT
OUR
CHURCH
CAME
DOWN
ON
ONE
OF
OUR
COLLEGE
GROUPS
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
ALLWOMEN
AND
THEY
WANTED
A
MAN
TO
LEAD
THE
STUDY
ALSO
MY
HUSBAND
AND
I
REALLY
RESENT
THE
WAY
EVERYONE
AT
OUR
CHURCH
FEELS
THAT
IF
YOU
ARENT
A
CONSERVATIVE
REPUBLICAN
YOU
ARENT
A
REAL
CHRISTIAN
I
GOT
TOLD
THAT
NOBODY
WHO
VOTED
FOR
CLINTON
SHOULD
CALL
THEMSELVES
A
CHRISTIAN
HENCE
WE
ARE
SUBJECTED
DURING
THE
SERVICE
TO
LONG
PRAYERS
CALLING
FOR
THINGS
WE
FLATLY
DONT
AGREE
WITH
WE
ARE
ALSO
DONT
AGREE
WITH
THE
C
OF
CS
DREAD
OF
ANY
NEW
MOVEMENT
BEING
LED
BY
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
SO
WE
HAVE
BEEN
CHURCH
HUNTING
WITH
NO
SUCCESS
I
WANT
A
REASONABLY
BIBLICAL
BASED
CHURCH
WHERE
WOMEN
ARE
VIEWED
AS
WHOLE
PEOPLE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THEIR
CALLING
C
OF
C
REALLY
LOOKED
DOWN
ON
CAREER
WOMEN
CHRISTOPHER
IS
LOOKING
FOR
A
CHURCH
WITH
DEEPLY
ROOTED
RELIGIOUS
CONVICTIONS
WITH
ADULT
BAPTISM
AND
A
CHURCH
WHERE
THE
MEMBERS
STILL
BRING
THEIR
BIBLES
TO
SERVICE
WE
ARE
SO
CONFUSED
HERE
AND
WERE
DRIFTING
AROUND
TRYING
TO
FIND
A
PLACE
WHERE
WE
BOTH
FEEL
LOVED
AND
CAN
EXPRESS
OUR
FAITH
HONESTLY
AND
WITHOUT
RESERVATION
IF
ANYONE
CAN
POINT
US
IN
A
DIRECTION
WED
BE
THRILLED
IM
AFRAID
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
VERY
HARD
FOR
ME
TO
GO
BACK
TO
C
OF
C
AND
EVEN
HARDER
FOR
ME
TO
STAY
CHURCHLESS
FOR
LONG
ANY
RESPONSES
WOULD
BE
WELCOME
THE
DIEL
FAMILY
I
WOULD
THINK
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
BAPTIST
SPECTRUM
YOU
MIGHT
FIND
WHAT
YOURE
LOOKING
FOR
HOWEVER
THE
ISSUE
IS
PROBABLY
MORE
ONE
OF
THE
FLAVOR
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
LOCAL
CHURCHES
IN
YOUR
AREA
THAN
THE
DENOMINATION
BAPTISTS
COVER
QUITE
A
SPECTRUM
ADULT
BAPTISM
SORT
OF
NARROWS
YOUR
CHOICES
ON
THE
MORE
LIBERAL
END
OF
THE
SPECTRUM
HISTORICALLY
THATS
BEEN
ASSOCIATED
WITH
MOVEMENTS
THAT
HAVE
THE
CHARACTER
YOURE
TRYING
TO
AVOID
CLH
