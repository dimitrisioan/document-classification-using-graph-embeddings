RE
QUESTION
ABOUT
VIRGIN
MARY
D
ANDREW
KILLE
WRITES
JUST
AN
OBSERVATION
ALTHOUGH
THE
BODILY
ASSUMPTION
HAS
NO
BASIS
IN
THE
BIBLE
CARL
JUNG
DECLARED
IT
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
PRONOUNCEMENTS
OF
THE
CHURCH
IN
RECENT
YEARS
IN
THAT
IT
IMPLIED
THE
INCLUSION
OF
THE
FEMININE
INTO
THE
GODHEAD
WHICH
MEANS
HE
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
IDEA
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
ASSUMPTION
IS
HOWEVER
GREATLY
WE
EXTOLL
MARY
IT
IS
QUITE
OBVIOUS
THAT
SHE
IS
IN
NO
WAY
GOD
OR
EVEN
PART
OF
GOD
OR
EQUAL
TO
GOD
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
OUR
BLESSED
MOTHER
MEANT
THAT
BECAUSE
OF
HER
CLOSE
IDENTIFICATION
WITH
THE
REDEMPTIVE
WORK
OF
CHRIST
SHE
WAS
ASSUMED
NOTE
THAT
SHE
DID
NOT
ASCEND
BODY
AND
SOUL
INTO
HEAVEN
AND
IS
THUS
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
ALONG
WITH
ELIJAH
ENOCH
MOSES
MAYBE
WHO
ARE
ALREADY
PERFECTED
IN
HEAVEN
OBVIOUSLY
THE
VIRGIN
MARY
IS
FAR
SUPERIOR
IN
GLORIFICATION
TO
ANY
OF
THE
PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED
PERSONAGES
JUNG
SHOULD
STICK
TO
PSYCHOLOGY
RATHER
THAN
GETTING
INTO
THEOLOGY
