does

anyone
who
is

isnt
really
a

at
all
it
sounds
like
it
to
me
if
thats
the
only
reason
id
be
inclined
to
doubt
whether
or
not
what
they
profess
is
christianity
the
relationship
of
faith
is
based
upon
trust
fear
and
trust
are
generally
incompatible
if
my
only
motivation
is
fear
is
there
room
for
trust
if
so
theres
room
for
faith
if
fear
precludes
trust
then
there
cant
be
faith
