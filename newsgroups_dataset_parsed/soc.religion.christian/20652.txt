RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
CAROL

CARALVCARALVAUTOTROLCOM
WROTE
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
SORRY
I
DONT
HAVE
A
BIBLE
AT
WORK
AND
CANT
PROVIDE
A
REFERENCE
WOMEN
ARE
INSTRUCTED
TO
BE
SILENT
AND
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
IN
CHURCH
NOW
THIS
IS
SCRIPTURE
BY
YOUR
DEFINITION
THIS
IS
TRUTH
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTE
DO
WOMEN
IN
YOUR
CHURCH
SPEAK
DO
THEY
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
IF
ALL
SCRIPTURE
IS
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WOMEN
SPEAKING
IN
AND
COMING
TO
CHURCH
WITH
BARE
HEADS
SHOULD
BE
INTOLERABLE
TO
EVANGELICALS
YET
CLEARLY
WOMEN
DO
SPEAK
IN
EVANGELICAL
CHURCHES
AND
COME
WITH
BARE
HEADS
AT
LEAST
THIS
WAS
THE
CASE
IN
THE
EVANGELICAL
CHURCHES
I
GREW
UP
IN
EVANGELICALS
ARE
CLEARLY
NOT
TAKING
THIS
PARTICULAR
PART
OF
SCRIPTURE
TO
BE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AND
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
OTHER
EXAMPLES
CAN
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
THE
PROBLEM
YOU
SEE
HERE
IS
THAT
SOME
CHRISTIANS
CLAIM
THINGS
ABOUT
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
THEY
DONT
ACTUALLY
BELIEVE
OR
PRACTICE
IVE
KNOWN
ALL
SORTS
OF
CHRISTIANS
RANGING
FROM
THE
TRENDIEST
OF
LIBERALS
TO
THE
FIREBREATHING
FUNDAMENTALISTS
AND
ALTHOUGH
MANY
ON
THE
CONSERVATIVE
SIDE
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
DO
CLAIM
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
A
PERHAPS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
ANYONE
WHO
TREATS
IT
AS
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
A
VALUABLE
PART
OF
A
LIVING
TRADITION
WHILE
I
AM
NOT
A
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
CLOSE
TO
THE
OFFICIAL
POSITION
OF
THE
RC
CHURCH
PERHAPS
AN
RC
WOULD
LIKE
TO
COMMENT
THE
PARTICULAR
PRACTICE
YOU
REFER
TO
WILL
USUALLY
BE
EXPLAINED
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
SOCIAL
CONTEXT
OF
THE
TIME
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CONSERVATIVES
SEEM
TO
HAVE
TO
BREAK
OUT
THE
TOPHATANDCANE
AND
GIVE
YOU
SOME
BIG
SONGANDDANCE
ROUTINE
ABOUT
WHY
THIS
OTHER
PASSAGES
AS
WELL
ARENT
DIRECTLY
APPLICABLE
TODAY
WOULD
SHOW
THEM
THAT
WHAT
THEY
CLAIM
ABOUT
THE
BIBLE
AND
WHAT
THEY
ACTUALLY
PRACTICE
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
BUT
MOSTLY
IT
DOENST
WHILE
THIS
THREAD
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
ABOUT
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
REALLY
HYPOCRASY
IN
THIS
CASE
MAKING
CLAIMS
ABOUT
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
THE
CLAIMANTS
DONT
ACTUALLY
PUT
INTO
PRACTICE
BUT
IF
WE
STEP
BACK
FROM
THE
NAMECALLING
AND
LOOK
AT
WHAT
PEOPLE
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
SAY
WE
SEE
THAT
THEY
ARE
TRYING
TO
EXPRESS
VERY
CONCISELY
THE
UNIQUE
PLACE
THE
BIBLE
HOLDS
WITHIN
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
SO
WHEN
PEOPLE
USE
SUCH
WORDS
OR
PHRASES
AS
WORD
OF
GOD
INERRANT
INFALLIBALE
THE
MANUFACTURERS
HANDBOOK
THE
ONLY
RULE
OF
FAITH
AND
PRACTICE
IN
THE
CHURCH
TODAY
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
BIBLE
WE
SHOULD
TRY
TO
HEAR
WHAT
THEY
ARE
SAYING
AND
NOT
JUST
LOOK
AT
THE
MERE
WORDS
THEY
USE
SOME
OF
THE
ABOVE
DESCRIPTIONS
ARE
DEMOSTRATABLY
FALSE
AND
OTHERS
ARE
SELFCONTRADICTORY
BUT
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
PEOPLE
ARE
GENERALLY
PRETTY
GOOD
AT
PICKING
OUT
THE
INTENTION
OF
THE
SPEAKER
EVEN
WHEN
THE
SPEAKERS
WORDS
ARE
AT
VARIANCE
WITH
THEIR
INTENTIONS
A
BIBLICAL
EXAMPLE
IS
FROM
THE
GARDEN
OF
EDEN
WHERE
GOD
ASKS
WHERE
ARE
YOU
AND
ADAM
EXPLAINS
THAT
HE
WAS
NAKED
AND
AFRAID
AND
HID
HIMSELF
IF
ADAM
HAD
ANSWERED
GODS
WORDS
HE
WOULD
HAVE
SAID
SOMETHING
LIKE
IM
HERE
IN
THIS
TREE
THE
PROBLEM
SEEMS
TO
ARISE
WHEN
CHRISTIANS
INSIST
THAT
THESE
WORDS
ARE
INDEED
ACCURATE
REFLECTIONS
OF
THEIR
BELEIF
MOST
PEOPLE
HAVE
NOT
MADE
A
DETERMINED
EFFORT
TO
WORK
OUT
THEIR
OWN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
BIBLE
WITHIN
THEIR
OWN
FAITH
AND
SO
RELY
ON
THE
PHRASES
AND
EXPLANATIONS
THAT
OTHERS
USE
I
