WHATS
IN
A
NAME
THE
SEQUEL
IVE
BEEN
THINKING
ABOUT
THE
IDEA
THAT
WAS
RAISED
BY
MICHAEL
COVINGTON
I
THINK
THAT
WORDS
MEAN
WHAT
WE
THINK
THEY
MEAN
REGARDLESS
OF
ETYMOLOGY
IVE
BEEN
REFLECTING
ON
WHAT
CERTAIN
WORDS
MEANT
IN
MY
CHILDHOOD
AND
TRACING
HOW
THIS
SHAPED
SOME
OF
MY
ATTITUDES
I
GREW
UP
IN
A
HOME
WHERE
CHRIST
WAS
A
BAD
WORD
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
VERY
ANGRY
SAID
IT
THE
WORD
CHRISTIAN
MEANT
SOMEONE
WHO
WAS
NOT
A
JEW
IT
CARRIED
CONNOTATIONS
OF
OTHERNESS
OF
THREAT
OF
ENEMY
IT
TOOK
SOME
TIME
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
CHRIST
AND
CHRISTIAN
WHEN
I
ACCEPTED
JESUS
I
EXPECTED
TO
BE
DISOWNED
TO
BECOME
A
CHRISTIAN
MEANT
TO
JOIN
THE
ENEMY
I
KNEW
OTHERS
WOULD
CONSIDER
ME
A
TRAITOR
AT
SOME
LEVEL
I
AGREED
BUT
WAS
STILL
PREPARED
TO
PAY
THIS
PRICE
LIKE
ESAU
I
SOLD
MY
BIRTHRIGHT
HOWEVER
I
MADE
A
BETTER
BARGAIN
HE
ONLY
GOT
SOME
STEW
BUT
I
GOT
THE
INCOMPARABLE
RICHES
OF
KNOWING
CHRIST
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT
MY
PARENTS
DID
NOT
DISOWN
ME
I
FOUND
OUT
LATER
THAT
THEY
WERE
HOPING
IT
WAS
A
PHASE
THAT
I
WOULD
GROW
OUT
OF
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
HAD
DECIDED
IT
WASNT
A
PHASE
THEY
WERE
SORT
OF
USED
TO
IT
THEY
DIDNT
DISOWN
ME
BUT
THEY
DIDNT
COMPLETELY
ACCEPT
THE
SITUATION
EITHER
FOR
EXAMPLE
THEY
DIDNT
COME
TO
MY
WEDDING
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
IN
A
CHURCH
WHEN
I
VISITED
MY
GRANDMOTHER
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
A
FEW
DAYS
BEFORE
HER
DEATH
SHE
SAID
TO
ME
AS
FAR
AS
IM
CONCERNED
YOU
STILL
ARE
A
JEW
WHAT
SHE
MEANT
WAS
THAT
SHE
LOVED
ME
AND
FORGAVE
ME
BUT
I
AM
NOT
A
JEW
I
AM
A
CHRISTIAN
ILL
CONCEDE
ONE
THAT
LIKES
CHICKEN
SOUP
WITH
MATZOH
BALLS
I
DO
NOT
KEEP
KOSHER
I
DO
NOT
CELEBRATE
THE
SABBATH
ON
SATURDAY
MY
SONS
ARE
NOT
CIRCUMCISED
BUT
THESE
THINGS
ARE
TRUE
OF
SOME
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
CONSIDER
THEMSELVES
JEWS
IT
IS
NOT
THESE
RULES
THAT
MAKE
PEOPLE
JEWS
IT
IS
THE
HERITAGE
FROM
THE
PAST
I
GAVE
UP
THE
PAST
THIS
IS
WHY
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
RELATE
TO
MESSIANIC
JEWS
THEIR
EXPERIENCE
IS
UNLIKE
MINE
THEY
STILL
CONSIDER
THEMSELVES
JEWS
WHILE
FOLLOWING
JESUS
SOME
WOULD
EVEN
SAY
THAT
I
MUST
DO
SO
TOO
I
AM
AT
A
STAGE
OF
MY
LIFE
NOW
WHERE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HAVE
A
HERITAGE
IT
WAS
NOT
SOMETHING
I
VALUED
VERY
MUCH
WHEN
I
GAVE
IT
BUT
I
DID
HAVE
A
SENSE
THAT
I
WAS
GIVING
IT
FOR
GOD
IT
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
A
SMALL
SACRIFICE
IT
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
AN
UNNECESSARY
SACRIFICE
BUT
I
GAVE
IT
AND
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
ASK
FOR
IT
BACK
AND
WHILE
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
HERITAGE
I
WAS
BORN
WITH
I
DO
HAVE
ANOTHER
I
AM
AN
OUTCAST
FROM
THE
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
BUT
I
AM
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
CHURCH
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
I
LIKE
ABOUT
BEING
A
CATHOLIC
CHRISTIAN
IS
THAT
IT
IS
RICH
IN
TRADITION
IT
GIVES
ME
A
FEELING
OF
ONCE
AGAIN
BEING
ROOTED
IN
THE
PAST
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
WHY
I
DONT
LIKE
IT
WHEN
PEOPLE
MESS
AROUND
WITH
CHRISTIAN
TRADITIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
CHANGING
THE
NAME
OF
EASTER
THESE
TRADITIONS
FILL
AN
IMPORTANT
EMOTIONAL
NEED
OF
MINE
I
SUPPOSE
THE
POINT
OF
ALL
THIS
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
SHOULDNT
ASSUME
THAT
ALL
BELIEVERS
OF
JEWISH
BACKGROUND
ARE
THE
SAME
FOR
SOME
JEWISH
CHRISTIAN
IS
A
GOOD
NAME
FOR
OTHERS
IT
IS
AN
