RE
MARYS
ASSUMPTION
I
HATE
TO
SOUND
FLIPPANT
HAVING
SHOT
OFF
MY
MOUTH
BADLY
ON
THE
NET
BEFORE
BUT
IM
AFRAID
THAT
MUCH
OF
THIS
MATERIAL
ONLY
ADDS
TO
MY
FEELING
THAT
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
WOULD
BE
BETTER
PHRASED
OUR
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
MARY
IN
ALL
THE
TIME
IVE
BEEN
READING
ABOUT
MARY
ON
THIS
GROUP
I
CAN
NOT
RECALL
READING
MUCH
ABOUT
MARY
THAT
DID
NOT
SOUND
LIKE
WISHFUL
VENERATION
WITH
SCANT
IF
ANY
SCRIPTURAL
FOUNDATION
I
FIND
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
A
VERY
REAL
PORTRAIT
OF
CHRISTS
PARENTS
AS
COMPELLINGLY
HUMAN
PERSONS
TO
BE
HONORED
AND
ADMIRED
FOR
THEIR
HUMILITY
AND
SUBMISSION
TO
GODS
WORKING
BEYOND
DOUBT
BUT
THE
ALMALGA
MATION
OF
THEORIES
AND
DOGMA
THAT
HAS
ACCRETED
AROUND
THEM
GIVES
ME
AN
IMAGE
OF
ALIEN
AND
INHUMAN
CREATURES
UNTOUCHED
BY
SIN
OR
HUMAN
DESIRE
ONLY
CHRIST
HIMSELF
WAS
SO
TRULY
SANCTIFIED
AND
EVEN
HE
KNEW
TEMPTATION
ALBEIT
WITHOUT
SUBMITTING
TO
IT
I
ALSO
DONT
SEE
THE
NECESSITY
OF
SAYING
THE
HOLY
PARENTS
WERE
SOME
HOW
SANCTIFIED
BEYOND
NORMAL
HUMANITY
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
OUR
OWN
INABILITY
TO
GRASP
THE
IMMENSITY
OF
GODS
GRACE
IN
BEING
INCARNATED
THROUGH
AN
OR
DINARY
HUMAN
BEING
I
WONT
START
YELLING
ABOUT
HOW
PEOPLE
ARE
WORSHIPPING
MARY
ETC
SINCE
FOLKS
HAVE
TOLD
ME
OTHERWISE
ABOUT
THAT
BUT
I
DO
THINK
WE
LOSE
PART
OF
THE
WONDER
OF
GODS
INCARNATION
IN
CHRIST
WHEN
WE
MAKE
HIS
PARENTS
OUT
TO
BE
SINLESS
SEXLESS
DEATHLESS
OTHERWORLDLY
