I
THINK
ITS
REALLY
SAD
THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
PUT
THEIR
FAITH
IN
A
MERE
MAN
EVEN
IF
HE
DID
CLAIM
TO
BE
THE
SON
OF
GOD
ANDOR
A
PROPHET
IT
IS
JUST
AS
CHRIST
SAID
ABOUT
HIS
RETURN
SOME
WILL
SAY
HE
IS
IN
THE
DESERT
OR
SOME
WILL
SAY
HE
IS
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
BUT
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THEM
FOR
AS
LIGHTNING
FLASHES
EAST
TO
WEST
SO
SHALL
THE
COMING
OF
THE
SON
OF
MAN
BE
MY
PARAPHRASE
I
THINK
THE
VERSE
IS
SOMEWHERE
IN
