D
ANDREW
KILLE
WRITES
IT
WAS
THE
MANIFESTATION
OF
THE
SPIRIT
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
THAT
CONVINCED
PETER
ACTS
THAT
HIS
PREJUDICE
AGAINST
THEM
BASED
ON
SCRIPTURE
I
MIGHT
ADD
WAS
NOT
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
GODS
INTENTIONS
I
WOULD
JUST
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
PARTICULAR
COMMAND
NOT
TO
EAT
OR
FELLOWSHIP
WITH
GENTILES
IS
NOT
FOUND
IN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
THIS
WAS
PART
OF
THE
HEDGE
BUILT
AROUND
THE
LAW
IT
WAS
A
PART
OF
PETERS
TRADITION
AND
NOT
THE
SCRIPTURE
