re
the
arrogance
of
christians
ive
just
read
carols
response
and
i
just
had
to
get
into
this
ive
got
some
verses
which
are
not
subject
to
interpretation
because
they
say
what
they
say
they
are
peter
timothy
and
galatians
also
based
on
the
fact
that
jesus
is
the
word
incarnate
and
he
judges
people
if
they
follow
him
see
acts
and
john
and
that
those
who
reject
jesus
teachings
are
judged
by
the
very
words
he
spoke
see
john
then
jesus
words
are
true
and
do
not
need
interpretation
nor
would
it
be
just
of
god
to
judge
based
on
his
word
if
it
had
to
be
interpreted
