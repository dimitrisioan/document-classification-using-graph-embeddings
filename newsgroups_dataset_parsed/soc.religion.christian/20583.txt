ACCEPTING
JEESUS
IN
YOUR
HEART
ERIC
MOLAS
WRITES
FIRSTLY
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
I
AM
NOT
POSTING
HERE
AS
AN
IMMATURE
FLAME
START
BUT
RATHER
TO
EXPRESS
AN
OPINION
TO
MY
INTENDED
AUDIENCE
DELETED
WE
ARE
JUST
ANIMALS
WE
NEED
SLEEP
FOOD
AND
WE
REPRODUCE
AND
WE
DIE
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
I
AM
NOT
AN
ATHEIST
IT
SEEMS
TRAGIC
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
CHOOSE
A
MEANINGLESS
EXISTENCE
HOW
TERRIBLE
TO
GO
ON
LIVING
ONLY
BECAUSE
ONE
FEARS
DEATH
MORE
THAN
LIFE
I
FEEL
SO
SORRY
FOR
ERIC
AND
YET
ANY
ATTEMPTS
TO
SHARE
MY
JOY
IN
LIFE
WITH
HIM
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
FURTHER
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
INFECTIOUS
NATURE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
I
AM
FREE
TO
BE
A
HUMAN
PERSON
I
THINK
LOVE
CHOOSE
AND
CREATE
I
WILL
LIVE
FOREVER
WITH
GOD
CHRIST
IS
NOT
A
KIND
OF
DRUG
DRUGS
ARE
A
REPLACEMENT
FOR
CHRIST
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
AN
EMPTY
SPOT
IN
THE
GODSHAPED
HOLE
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
MUST
DO
SOMETHING
TO
EASE
THE
PAIN
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
SUBSTANCEABUSE
RECOVERY
PROGRAMS
INVOLVE
MEETING
PEOPLES
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
THANK
YOU
ERIC
FOR
YOUR
POST
IT
HAS
HELPED
ME
TO
APPRECIATE
HOW
MUCH
GOD
HAS
BLESSED
ME
I
HOPE
THAT
YOU
WILL
SOMEDAY
HAVE
A
MORE
JOYFILLED
AND
ABUNDANT
LIFE
