HELP
JON
OGDEN
WROTE
IT
IS
A
DEAD
AND
USELESS
FAITH
WHICH
HAS
NO
ACTION
BEHIND
IT
ACTIONS
PROVE
OUR
FAITH
AND
SHOW
THE
GENUINENESS
OF
IT
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
OF
THIS
IS
ABRAHAM
REFERRED
TO
IN
THE
JAMES
PASSAGE
HEBREWS
SAYS
THAT
ABRAHAM
WAS
JUSTIFIED
BY
FAITH
BUT
HIS
FAITH
WAS
DEMONSTRATED
THROUGH
HIS
WORKS
IE
HE
OBEYED
WHAT
GOD
TOLD
HIM
TO
DO
READING
ABRAHAMS
BIOGRAPHY
IN
GENESIS
IS
VERY
INSTRUCTIVE
HE
WAS
A
MAN
BESET
BY
LACK
OF
FAITH
A
LOT
OF
THE
TIME
EG
LYING
ABOUT
SARAH
BEING
HIS
WIFE
ON
OCCASIONS
TRYING
TO
FULFIL
GODS
PROMISE
ON
GODS
BEHALF
BY
COPULATING
WITH
HAGAR
YET
IT
SEEMS
THAT
GOD
DIDNT
EVALUATE
HIM
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
INDIVIDUAL
INCIDENTS
ABRAHAM
IS
LISTED
AS
ONE
OF
THE
HEROES
OF
FAITH
IN
HEBREWS
IE
WHEN
IT
REALLY
CAME
TO
THE
CRUNCH
GOD
DECLARED
ABRAHAM
AS
A
MAN
OF
FAITH
HE
BELIEVED
GODS
PROMISES
THIS
GIVES
US
CONFIDENCE
ALTHOUGH
REAL
FAITH
DEMONSTRATES
ITSELF
THROUGH
WORKS
GOD
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
JUDGE
US
ACCORDING
TO
OUR
SUCCESSFAILURE
IN
PERFORMING
WORKS
NOT
BY
WORKS
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHICH
WE
HAVE
DONE
BUT
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
MERCY
HE
SAVED
US
THROUGH
THE
WASHING
OF
REGENERATION
AND
RENEWING
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
TITUS
AMAZING
GRACE
