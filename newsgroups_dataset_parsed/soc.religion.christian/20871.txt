WRITES
PARDON
ME
IF
THIS
IS
THE
WRONG
NEWSGROUP
I
WOULD
DESCRIBE
MYSELF
AS
AN
AGNOSTIC
IN
SO
FAR
AS
IM
SURE
THERE
IS
NO
SINGLE
UNIVERSAL
SUPREME
BEING
BUT
IF
THERE
IS
ONE
AND
IT
IS
JUST
WE
WILL
SURELY
BE
JUDGED
ON
WHETHER
WE
LIVED
GOOD
LIVES
STRIVING
TO
ACHIEVE
THAT
GOODNESS
THAT
IS
WITHIN
THE
POWER
OF
EACH
OF
US
NOW
THE
COMPLICATION
IS
THAT
ONE
OF
MY
BEST
FRIENDS
HAS
BECOME
VERY
FUNDAMENTALIST
THAT
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
A
NONISSUE
WITH
ME
BUT
HE
FEELS
IT
IS
HIS
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
PROSELYTIZE
ME
WHICH
I
GUESS
IT
IS
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FAITH
THIS
IS
A
GREAT
STRAIN
TO
OUR
FRIENDSHIP
SORRY
TO
DISAPPOINT
YOU
BUT
IM
AFRAID
YOUR
FRIENDSHIP
IS
IN
DANGER
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULD
EXAMINE
IN
YOURSELF
WHY
AS
SUCH
A
GOOD
FRIEND
YOU
ARE
UNWILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THIS
IMORTANT
PART
OF
YOUR
FRIENDS
LIFE
WHY
DO
YOU
CALL
INTO
QUESTION
HIS
FAITH
YOUR
FRIEND
HAS
CHANGED
HE
HAS
FOUND
SOMETHING
THAT
FILLS
A
NEED
IN
HIS
LIFE
YOU
NEED
TO
DECIDE
IF
YOU
ARE
STILL
HIS
FRIEND
WHETHER
YOU
CAN
ACCOMMODATE
HIS
NEW
LIFE
IT
SOUNDS
AS
IF
YOU
ARE
CRITICIZING
HIM
FOR
A
FUNDAMENTAL
BELIEF
IN
THE
BIBLE
YET
YOU
ARE
QUICK
TO
REVEAL
THAT
YOUR
FUNDAMENTAL
BELIEF
THAT
IT
IS
SUPERSTITION
PERHAPS
IF
HE
KNEW
YOU
AT
LEAST
TOOK
HIM
SERIOUSLY
THAT
YOU
AT
LEAST
TOOK
AN
INTEREST
IN
THE
LIGHT
HE
HAS
FOUND
THAT
YOU
AT
LEAST
TRIED
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
HAS
BECOME
A
SPECIAL
PART
OF
HIS
LIFE
YOU
COULD
TOGETHER
DECIDE
TO
BECOME
FUNDAMENTALISTS
RESPECT
EACH
OTHERS
DIFFERENCES
AND
REMAIN
FRIENDS
OR
PART
WAYS
MAYBE
EVEN
IF
YOU
STUCK
IT
OUT
WITH
HIM
YOU
COULD
HELP
HIM
TO
UNCONVERT
OF
COURSE
IF
YOU
GO
IN
WITH
THAT
ATTITUDE
HE
WILL
SURELY
SEE
THROUGH
YOUR
INTENTIONS
AND
BEGIN
TO
RESENT
YOU
I
HAPPEN
TO
BE
A
PERSON
VERY
TOLERANT
OF
FUNDAMENTALISTS
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
IDEA
OF
A
SIMPLE
BLACK
AND
WHITE
APPROACH
TO
LIFE
IS
APPEALING
I
DONT
HAPPEN
TO
SHARE
THE
BELIEFS
OF
FUNDAMENTALISTS
BUT
I
AM
NOT
OFFENDED
BY
THEIR
PROSYLETIZING
I
HAD
A
FEW
GOOD
CONVERSATIONS
WITH
SOME
WITNESSES
WHO
CAME
TO
MY
DOOR
I
DIDNT
SWITCH
MY
BELIEFS
BUT
FOR
THOSE
AT
HOME
WHO
MAYBE
NEED
A
FRIENDLY
FACE
TO
INVITE
THEM
SOMEWHERE
THE
WITNESSES
PROVIDE
A
WONDERFUL
SERVICE
YOU
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
CONDITIONED
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
RELIGION
IS
UNIMPORTANT
AND
WITNESSING
IS
OBNOXIOUS
BUT
WHY
ARE
YOU
AFRAID
YOU
MIGHT
BE
CONVERTED
AND
BECOME
ONE
OF
THEM
THAT
YOU
WILL
BE
SWEPT
UP
IN
FUNDAMENTALISM
THAT
YOU
WILL
BECOME
A
WEIRDO
FRIENDSHIPS
A
TWOWAY
STREET
YOU
MUST
RESPECT
YOUR
FRIEND
ALL
OF
HIM
INCLUDING
HIS
BELIEFS
IF
YOU
WANT
THE
FRIENDSHIP
TO
CONTINUE
