CAN
ANYBODY
TELL
ME
THE
BASIC
REASONS
FOR
HOLDING
A
BELIEF
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
JESUS
AND
VICE
VERSA
THE
FOUNDATIONS
FOR
THE
TRINITY
BJORN
ID
LOVE
TO
KNOW
HOW
JESUS
ONLY
PROPONENTS
WOULD
ANSWER
QUESTIONS
LIKE
WHO
IS
THIS
FATHER
JESUS
KEEPS
REFERRING
TO
WHY
DOES
HE
CALL
HIMSELF
THE
SON
WHY
DOES
HE
PRAY
TO
THE
FATHER
AND
NOT
TO
HIMSELF
WHY
DOES
HE
EMPHASIZE
THAT
HE
DOES
HIS
FATHERS
WILL
AND
NOT
HIS
OWN
IF
HE
WAS
DOING
HIS
OWN
WILL
WHAT
KIND
OF
EXAMPLE
IS
THAT
SHOULD
WE
FOLLOW
IT
WHEN
HE
SAYS
HE
HAS
TO
RETURN
TO
THE
FATHER
WHO
IS
HE
GOING
TO
WHEN
HE
SAYS
HE
DOES
THIS
IN
ORDER
THAT
THE
COMFORTER
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
MIGHT
COME
WHO
MIGHT
THAT
BE
IF
HE
CLAIMS
THAT
THE
COMING
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IS
SUCH
A
BLESSING
THAT
ITS
WORTH
HIS
LEAVING
US
AND
RETURNING
TO
THE
FATHER
WHAT
CAN
THAT
MEAN
IF
THERE
IS
NO
HOLY
SPIRIT
WHY
DOESNT
THE
BEST
KNOWN
CHRISTIAN
PRAYER
BEGIN
OUR
SAVIOUR
WHO
ART
IN
HEAVEN
RATHER
THAN
OUR
FATHER
DO
THEY
HAVE
ANSWERS
TO
THESE
QUESTIONS
THAT
ARE
EVEN
PLAUSIBLE
FURTHER
ENTERTAINING

THERE
MAY
BE
SOME
MISUNDERSTANDING
OVER
TERMS
HERE
I
BELIEVE
JESUS
ONLY
ORIGINALLY
WAS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
BAPTISM
THESE
ARE
FOLKS
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
BAPTISM
SHOULD
BE
DONE
WITH
A
FORMULA
MENTIONING
ONLY
JESUS
RATHER
THAN
FATHER
SON
AND
HOLY
SPIRIT
THIS
MAY
HAVE
DOCTRINAL
IMPLICATIONS
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
IT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THESE
FOLKS
DENY
THE
EXISTENCE
OR
DIVINITY
OF
THE
FATHER
IM
NOT
THE
RIGHT
ONE
TO
DESCRIBE
THIS
THEOLOGY
AND
IN
FACT
I
THINK
THERE
MAY
BE
SEVERAL
INCLUDING
WHAT
WOULD
CLASSICALLY
BE
CALLED
MONOPHYSITE
OR
ARIAN
TWO
RATHER
DIFFERENT
VIEWS
AS
WELL
AS
SOME
WHO
HAVE
BELIEFS
THAT
ARE
PROBABLY
CONSISTENT
WITH
TRINITARIAN
STANDARDS
BUT
WHO
WONT
USE
TRINITARIAN
LANGUAGE
BECAUSE
THEY
MISUNDERSTAND
IT
OR
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IT
IS
NOT
BIBLICAL
