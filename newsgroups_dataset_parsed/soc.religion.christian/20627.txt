the
discussion
begins
why
does
the
universe
exist
at
all
must
there
be
a
why
to
this
i
ask
because
of
what
you
also
assume
about
god
namely
that
he
just
exists
with
no
why
to
his
existence
so
the
question
is
reversed
why
cant
we
assume
the
universe
just
exists
as
you
assume
god
to
just
exist
why
must
there
be
a
why
to
the
universe
one
of
the
laws
of
nature
specifying
cause
and
effect
seems
to
dictate
at
least
to
this
laymans
mind
there
must
be
a
causal
event
no
reasonable
alternative
exists
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
very
laws
of
nature
demand
a
why
that
isnt
true
of
something
outside
of
nature
ie
supernatural
it
may
be
that
one
day
man
not
only
can
create
life
but
can
also
create
man
now
i
dont
see
this
happening
in
my
lifetime
nor
do
i
assert
it
is
probable
but
the
possibility
is
there
given
scientists
are
working
hard
at
decoding
out
genetic
code
to
perhaps
help
cure
disease
of
a
genetic
variation
again
though
must
there
be
why
or
a
divine
prupose
to
mans
existence
i
believe
the
genetic
code
will
be
entirely
deciphered
in
our
lifetimes
but
we
will
not
see
man
convert
entirely
inert
material
into
self
sustaining
reproducing
life
ever
ive
never
been
much
of
a
prophet
though
i
cant
even
picture
new
york
in
my
mind
i
dont
believe
any
technology
would
be
able
to
produce
that
necessary
spark
of
life
despite
having
all
of
the
parts
available
just
my
opinion
when
you
say
that
man
is
only
an
animal
i
have
to
think
that
you
are
presenting
an
unprovable
statement
a
dogma
if
you
will
and
one
the
requires
a
kind
of
faith
too
by
taking
such
a
hard
line
in
your
atheism
you
may
have
stumbled
into
a
religion
of
your
own
as
far
as
we
can
tell
man
falls
into
the
mammal
catagory
now
that
preposition
sort
of
precludes
an
absolute
doesnt
it
without
an
absolute
conclusion
what
are
we
left
with
i
believe
the
word
faith
works
nicely
if
there
were
something
more
to
the
man
say
a
soul
then
we
have
yet
to
find
evidence
of
such
but
as
it
is
now
man
is
a
mammal
babies
are
born
live
mother
gives
milk
were
warmblooded
etc
as
other
mammals
are
and
is
similar
in
genetic
construction
to
some
of
them
in
particular
primates
for
more
on
this
check
out
talkorigins
but
before
you
write
off
all
christianity
as
phony
and
shallow
i
hope
youll
do
a
little
research
into
its
history
and
varieties
perhaps
by
reading
paul
johnsons
a
history
of
christianity
from
your
remarks
it
seems
that
you
have
been
exposed
to
certain
types
of
christian
religion
and
not
others
even
an
atheist
should
have
enough
faith
in
man
to
know
that
a
movement
of
years
has
to
have
some
depth
and
be
animated
by
some
enduring
values
well
then
buddhism
confucianism
taoism
hinduism
judaism
zoerasterism
shintoism
and
islam
should
fit
this
bit
of
logic
quite
nicely
all
have
depth
all
have
enduring
values
thus
all
must
be
true
well
then
with
an
equal
scale
and
under
an
equal
standard
investigate
them
all
and
discover
where
god
is
or
whether
he
is
for
the
denial
of
god
is
ultimately
a
statement
of
faith
nonfalsifiable
as
his
existence
may
be
for
isnt
this
the
purpose
of
religion
to
discover
and
in
discovery
to
know
god
you
dont
mind
if
a
few
of
us
send
up
a
prayer
on
your
behalf
during
your
research
do
you
after
all
if
we
of
christ
are
deluding
ourselves
you
really
have
nothing
to
worry
about
eh
until
the
king
