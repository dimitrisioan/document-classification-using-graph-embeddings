RE
PROOF
OF
RESURECTION
IN
ARTICLE
REEDRCGSVAXCLAREMONTEDU
WRITES
WE
ALSO
CANNOT
FAIL
TO
NOTE
THE
INTENSE
SUFFERING
A
DEVASTATION
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
WRECKED
ON
OUR
WORLD
BECAUSE
OF
CHRISTIANS
WHO
WERE
CERTAIN
THEY
WERE
FOLLOWING
CHRIST
FROM
CAPTIALIST
WHO
HAVE
POLLUTED
THE
ENVIORMENT
IN
STRICT
OBEDIENCE
TO
THE
GENSIS
COMMAND
TO
SUBDUE
THE
EARTH
TO
NAZIS
WHO
HAVE
JUSTLY
PUNISHED
THE
JEWS
FOR
THE
KILLING
CHRIST
AS
WELL
AS
THE
OTHER
PROGROMS
THE
INNOCENT
WOMEN
WHO
WERE
BURNED
ALIVE
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
YOU
SHALL
NOT
ALLOW
A
WITCH
TO
LIVE
THE
MOSLEMS
WHO
WERE
KILLED
IN
THE
CRUSADES
THE
GODFEARING
MEN
DESTROYED
BY
THE
INQUISTION
THE
RELIGIOUS
WARS
IN
SPAIN
FRANCE
ENGLAND
ETC
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
UNDOUBTEDLY
CAUSED
THE
MOST
SUFFERING
AND
NEEDLESS
LOSS
OF
LIFE
BY
INDIVIDUALS
WHOSE
CERTAINITY
THAT
THEY
WERE
FOLLOWING
THE
INSTRUCTIONS
THEREIN
WAS
UNQUESTIONABLE
THERE
IS
MUCH
TO
GRIEVE
RANDY
VERY
INTERESTING
BUT
I
ALSO
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
PRESENTED
A
MISLEADING
ARGUMENT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOT
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
MASSACRES
AND
HORRIFIC
INJUSTICES
THAT
YOU
RELATE
RATHER
THEY
ARE
THE
FAULT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
MISUNDERSTAND
JESUS
CHRISTS
MESSAGE
AND
MODIFY
IT
TO
SUIT
THEIR
OWN
BELIEFS
AND
AIMS
RATHER
THAN
ALTER
THEIR
AMBITIONS
TO
BE
MORE
IN
LINE
WITH
THOSE
PRESENTED
AS
DESIRABLE
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
WITH
EVERY
TRUTHFUL
AND
GOOD
MESSAGE
THAT
CARRIES
AUTHORITY
OR
IMPLIED
AUTHORITY
COMES
THE
INEVITABLE
FACT
THAT
SOME
MANY
PEOPLE
WILL
UNDERSTAND
IT
IN
A
DISTORTED
WAY
WITH
INEVITABLE
CONSEQUENCES
THE
BIBLES
MESSAGE
IS
THAT
WE
ARE
TO
LOVE
ALL
PEOPLE
AND
THAT
ALL
PEOPLE
ARE
REDEEMABLE
IT
PREACHES
A
MESSAGE
OF
REPENTANCE
AND
OF
GIVING
UNFORTUNATELY
ALL
PEOPLE
HAVE
DECEITFUL
HEARTS
AND
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
TURNING
THIS
MESSAGE
AROUND
AND
CONTORTING
IT
IN
SOMETIMES
UNBELIEVABLE
WAYS
THIS
IS
ALSO
A
FUNDAMENTAL
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
ONE
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
IS
THAT
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
THE
EYES
OF
WESTERN
HISTORY
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
WILL
FIND
MANY
MANY
CASES
OF
MASSACRES
THAT
WERE
INSTIGATED
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
NEVER
CLAIMED
THEY
WERE
CHRISTIAN
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THIS
TO
JUSTIFY
THE
MASSACRES
THAT
WERE
BUT
I
AM
MERELY
POINTING
YOU
TO
A
TENDENCY
WHICH
IS
PRESENT
IN
HUMANS
ALREADY
CONSIDER
THE
WORLD
WITHOUT
CHRISTIANITY
I
DOUBT
THAT
WE
WOULD
HAVE
THE
SAME
FREEDOMS
IN
THE
COUNTRIES
IN
WHICH
WE
LIVE
IF
IT
WASNT
FOR
THE
PEACEFUL
DOCTRINES
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
PERHAPS
WE
WOULD
EVEN
BE
CONFRONTED
BY
A
VERY
HARSH
RELIGION
I
WONT
NAME
ANY
HERE
THOUGH
ONE
COMES
TO
MIND
WHICH
WOULD
NOT
EVEN
ALLOW
US
THE
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
TO
DEBATE
SUCH
SUBJECTS
POINT
THE
BLAME
AT
INHERENT
HUMAN
TENDENCIES
OF
THIRST
FOR
POWER
GREED
AND
HATRED
PLEASE
DONT
POINT
THE
BLAME
AT
A
MESSAGE
WHICH
PREACHES
FUNDAMENTAL
GIVING
AND
DENIAL
IN
LOVE
FOR
OTHERS
YOURS
IN
CHRIST
ANDREW
MCVEIGH
PS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
A
LINE
OF
QUESTIONING
LIKE
YOU
PRESENTED
IS
STRANGELY
ENOUGH
COMPATIBLE
WITH
BECOMING
A
CHRISTIAN
CERTAINLY
CHRISTIANITY
ENCOURAGES
ONE
TO
QUESTION
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
ESPECIALLY
CHRISTIANS
I
PRAISE
GOD
FOR
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
CAN
DOUBT
OUR
BELIEFS
AND
STILL
COME
BACK
TO
GOD
AND
BE
FORGIVEN
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
