SCOTT
MUNNS
WRITES
EVENTUALLY
WE
GOT
AROUND
TO
HOW
WE
SHOULD
PRAY
IN
JESUS
NAME
THEN
AN
EXCELLENT
QUESTION
CAME
UP
ONE
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
A
REAL
ANSWER
TO
THE
QUESTION
WAS
IF
WE
NEED
TO
PRAY
IN
JESUS
NAME
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PEOPLE
BEFORE
JESUS
THEY
PRAYED
TO
GOD
AND
HE
LISTENED
THEN
IN
SPITE
OF
THEIR
SINS
WHY
CANT
IT
BE
THE
SAME
WAY
NOW
AND
IN
THAT
DAY
YOU
WILL
ASK
ME
NO
QUESTION
TRULY
TRULY
I
SAY
TO
YOU
IF
YOU
SHALL
ASK
THE
FATHER
FOR
ANYTHING
HE
WILL
GIVE
IT
TO
YOU
IN
MY
NAME
UNTIL
NOW
YOU
HAVE
ASKED
FOR
NOTHING
IN
MY
NAME
ASK
AND
YOU
WILL
RECEIVE
THAT
YOUR
JOY
MAY
BE
MADE
FULL
JOHN
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
NECESSARILY
HAVE
TO
SAY
IN
CHRISTS
NAME
AMEN
FOR
OUR
PRAYERS
TO
BE
HEARD
BUT
IT
GLORIFIES
THE
SON
WHEN
WE
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
OUR
PRAYER
IS
MADE
POSSIBLE
BY
HIM
I
BELIEVE
THAT
JUST
AS
THOSE
WHO
WERE
SAVED
IN
THE
OT
COULD
ONLY
BE
SAVED
BECAUSE
JESUS
WOULD
ONE
DAY
RECONCILE
GOD
TO
MAN
HE
IS
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEIR
PRAYERS
WOULD
BE
HEARD
BY
GOD
FOR
ALL
OF
US
HAVE
BECOME
LIKE
ONE
WHO
IS
UNCLEAN
AND
ALL
OUR
RIGHTEOUS
DEEDS
ARE
LIKE
A
FILTHY
GARMENT
AND
ALL
OF
US
WITHER
LIKE
A
LEAF
AND
OUR
INIQUITIES
LIKE
THE
WIND
TAKE
US
AWAY
ISAIAH
NAS
OUR
PRAYERS
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
OUR
DEEDS
ARE
TOO
UNHOLY
TO
GO
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
FATHER
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
TAINTED
BY
OUR
SIN
ONLY
BY
WASHING
THESE
PRAYERS
WITH
CHRISTS
BLOOD
ARE
THEY
WORTHY
TO
BE
LIFTED
TO
TO
THE
FATHER
FIRST
I
THANK
MY
GOD
THROUGH
CHRIST
JESUS
ROMANS
NAS
SOME
SCHOLARS
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
PAUL
RECOGNIZING
THAT
EVEN
HIS
THANKS
ARE
TOO
UNHOLY
FOR
THE
FATHER
BASICALLY
PRAYER
IS
A
GIFT
OF
GRACE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
ONLY
THROUGH
JESUS
DO
OUR
PRAYERS
HAVE
ANY
POWER
THUS
PRAYING
IN
HIS
NAME
GLORIFIES
AND
PRAISES
JESUS
FOR
THIS
BEAUTIFUL
AND
POWERFUL
GIFT
