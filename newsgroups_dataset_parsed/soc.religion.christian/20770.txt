RE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
IN
ARTICLE
CLH
WRITES
RE
ARE
YOU
CHRISTIAN
OR
PAULINE
BOTH
SURE
WHY
NOT
BUT
ARE
YOU
USING
PAUL
TO
CORRECT
THE
WORDS
OF
JESUS
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
IN
MY
MIND
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
SIN
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
AT
LEAST
NOT
IN
THIS
CASE
JESUS
DID
NOT
DEAL
EXPLICITLY
WITH
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
THE
LAW
WAS
BINDING
ON
GENTILES
SO
ANYONE
WHO
DISSOLVES
EVEN
ONE
OF
THE
SMALLEST
COMMANDS
AND
TEACHES
OTHERS
THE
SAME
WAY
WILL
BE
KNOWN
AS
THE
LOWEST
IN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
THE
SKIES
WHEREAS
ANYONE
WHO
KEEPS
THE
COMMANDS
AND
TEACHES
THEM
TOO
WILL
BE
KNOWN
AS
SOMEONE
GREAT
IN
THE
KINGDOM
OF
THE
SKIES
GAUS
ARE
YOU
AN
ANYONE
OR
ARE
YOU
A
NO
ONE
WHY
NOT
ASSUME
THAT
SINCE
JESUS
DIDNT
SAY
THAT
HIS
WORDS
APPLY
ONLY
TO
JEWS
THAT
THEY
APPLY
TO
ALL
HUMAN
BEINGS
IRREGARDLESS
OF
RACE
OR
SEX
WHY
NOT
ASSUME
THAT
EVEN
THOUGH
JESUS
DID
NOT
MENTION
YOUR
NAME
STILL
JESUS
WAS
TALKING
DIRECTLY
TO
YOU
THATS
WHY
I
HAVE
TO
CITE
EVIDENCE
SUCH
AS
THE
WAY
JESUS
DEALT
WITH
THE
CENTURION
AS
TO
GENERAL
JEWISH
VIEWS
ON
THIS
I
AM
DEPENDENT
LARGELY
ON
STUDIES
OF
PAULINE
THEOLOGY
ONE
BY
HJ
SCHOEPS
AND
ONE
WHOSE
AUTHOR
I
CANT
COME
UP
WITH
AT
THE
MOMENT
BOTH
AUTHORS
ARE
JEWS
ALSO
VARIOUS
CHRISTIAN
AND
NONCHRISTIAN
JEWS
HAVE
DISCUSSED
THE
ISSUE
HERE
AND
IN
OTHER
NEWSGROUPS
MAT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
LAW
IS
STILL
VALID
IT
DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
IT
APPLIES
TO
GENTILES
DOES
IT
SAY
THAT
IT
APPLIES
TO
YOU
ARE
YOU
ANYONE
OR
NO
ONE
AND
YES
I
SAY
THAT
THE
SPECIFIC
REQUIREMENT
FOR
WORSHIP
ON
THE
SABBATH
IN
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
IS
A
CEREMONIAL
DETAIL
WHEN
YOURE
LOOKING
AT
THE
OBLIGATIONS
OF
GENTILES
REMEMBER
THE
SABBATH
DAY
AND
KEEP
IT
HOLY
SIX
DAYS
YOU
SHALL
LABOR
AND
DO
ALL
YOUR
WORK
BUT
THE
SEVENTH
DAY
IS
A
SABBATH
OF
THE
LORD
YOUR
GOD
YOU
SHALL
NOT
DO
ANY
WORK
YOU
YOUR
SON
OR
DAUGHTER
YOUR
MALE
OR
FEMALE
SLAVE
OR
YOUR
CATTLE
OR
THE
STRANGER
WHO
IS
WITHIN
YOUR
SETTLEMENTS
FOR
IN
SIX
DAYS
THE
LORD
MADE
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
AND
SEA
AND
ALL
THAT
IS
IN
THEM
AND
HE
RESTED
ON
THE
SEVENTH
DAY
THEREFORE
THE
LORD
BLESSED
THE
SABBATH
DAY
AND
HOLLOWED
IT
NOTE
THERE
IS
NO
SPECIFIC
REQUIREMENT
FOR
WORSHIP
HERE
HOWEVER
I
FOR
ONE
WOULD
NOT
BE
SO
BOLD
AS
TO
CALL
THESE
VERSES
A
CEREMONIAL
DETAIL
SIMILARLY
CIRCUMCISION
DONT
MANY
CHRISTIANS
STILL
PRACTICE
CIRCUMCISION
IM
NOT
SURE
QUITE
WHAT
ELSE
I
CAN
SAY
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
AGAIN
ITS
UNFORTUNATE
THE
JESUS
DIDNT
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
DIRECTLY
ITS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
JESUS
DIDNT
USE
YOUR
NAME
DIRECTLY
OR
MAYBE
JESUS
DID
ARE
YOU
SOMEBODY
OR
NOBODY
HOWEVER
WE
DO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
CENT
JEWISH
APPROACH
WAS
HOW
JESUS
DEALT
WITH
AT
LEAST
ONE
GENTILE
AND
HOW
JESUS
DISCIPLES
DEALT
WITH
THE
ISSUE
WHEN
IT
BECAME
MORE
ACUTE
IM
REFERRING
TO
ACTS
MORE
THAN
PAUL
GIVEN
THAT
THESE
ARE
ALL
IN
AGREEMENT
I
DONT
SEE
THAT
THERES
A
BIG
PROBLEM
IF
YOU
DONT
SEE
A
PROBLEM
THEN
PERHAPS
THERE
IS
NONE
AS
PAUL
CLOSES
ROMANS
GAUS
IN
SHORT
PURSUE
THE
ENDS
OF
PEACE
AND
OF
BUILDING
EACH
OTHER
UP
DONT
LET
DIETARY
CONSIDERATIONS
UNDO
THE
WORK
OF
GOD
EVERYTHING
MAY
BE
CLEAN
BUT
ITS
EVIL
FOR
THE
PERSON
WHO
EATS
IT
IN
AN
OFFENSIVE
SPIRIT
BETTER
NOT
TO
EAT
THE
MEAT
OR
DRINK
THE
WINE
OR
WHATEVER
ELSE
YOUR
BROTHER
IS
OFFENDED
BY
AS
FOR
THE
FAITH
THAT
YOU
HAVE
KEEP
THAT
BETWEEN
YOURSELF
AND
GOD
THE
PERSON
IS
IN
LUCK
WHO
DOESNT
CONDEMN
HIMSELF
FOR
WHAT
HE
SAMPLES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
PERSON
WITH
DOUBTS
ABOUT
SOMETHING
WHO
EATS
IT
ANYWAY
IS
GUILTY
BECAUSE
HE
ISNT
ACTING
ON
HIS
FAITH
AND
ANY
FAILURE
TO
ACT
ON
FAITH
IS
A
SIN
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
CHRISTIANS
EXCEPT
SPECIFIC
JEWISH
CHRISTIAN
GROUPS
AND
MAYBE
SOME
OF
THE
SABBATARIANS
BOTH
OF
WHICH
ARE
VERY
SMALL
GROUPS
DO
NOT
PRACTICE
CIRCUMCISION
ON
RELIGIOUS
GROUNDS
IN
SOME
COUNTRIES
IT
HAS
BEEN
DONE
FOR
SUPPOSED
HEALTH
REASONS
BUT
IVE
NOT
HEARD
IT
ARGUED
THAT
IT
IS
BEING
DONE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BIBLICAL
COMMANDMENT
