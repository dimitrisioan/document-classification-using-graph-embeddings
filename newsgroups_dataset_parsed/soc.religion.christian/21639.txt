TEN
COMMANDMENTS
OR
TEN
DISCOURSES
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
DISCUSSING
THE
SABBATH
WITH
SOME
FOLKS
I
CAME
ACROSS
SOMETHING
THAT
WAS
COMPLETELY
NEW
TO
ME
AND
I
THOUGHT
ID
OFFER
IT
FOR
COMMENT
TO
KEEP
THIS
AS
BRIEF
AS
POSSIBLE
LET
ME
STATE
MY
OBSERVATION
AS
A
DECLARATIVE
STATEMENT
AND
THEN
WHOEVER
WANTS
TO
CAN
COMMENT
ON
IT
BASICALLY
WHAT
I
THINK
IVE
OBSERVED
IS
THAT
THE
PHRASE
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
AS
USED
BY
MOSES
IS
NOT
A
REFERENCE
TO
EX
BUT
RATHER
A
REFERENCE
TO
TEN
DISTINCT
DISCOURSES
FROM
EX
THROUGH
EX
THAT
IS
THE
PHRASE
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
SHOULD
MORE
ACCURATELY
BE
TRANSLATED
THE
TEN
DISCOURSES
OF
WHICH
THE
PASSAGE
WE
CALL
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
IS
REALLY
ONLY
THE
FIRST
IM
NOT
COMPLETELY
CONVINCED
THAT
THE
ABOVE
IS
TRUE
BUT
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
DISCUSSION
LET
ME
ARGUE
IT
AS
THOUGH
I
WAS
SURE
ARGUMENTS
SUPPORTING
THE
ABOVE
IDEA
THERE
ARENT
REALLY
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
IN
EX
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
COMMANDMENTS
YOU
HAVE
TO
GET
TWO
OF
THEM
OUT
OF
VERSES
AND
THE
VERSES
THEMSELVES
DO
NOT
SUPPORT
SUCH
A
DIVISION
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
ALL
ABOUT
NOT
WORSHIPPING
OTHER
GODS
THAT
IS
VERSE
COMMANDS
TO
HAVE
NO
OTHER
GODS
AND
VERSE
COMMANDS
TO
NOT
WORSHIP
THE
IDOLS
MENTIONED
IN
VERSE
YOU
CANT
VIOLATE
VERSES
WITHOUT
VIOLATING
VERSE
INDICATING
THAT
THE
WHOLE
PASSAGE
IS
ONE
COMMAND
AND
LEAVING
US
WITH
ONLY
NINE
COMMANDMENTS
I
COULD
GO
ON
AT
LENGTH
ABOUT
THIS
BUT
FOR
NOW
ILL
JUST
STOP
WITH
THIS
SUMMARY
THERE
ARE
TEN
SPEECHES
BETWEEN
EX
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
TRADITIONAL
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
AND
EX
WHERE
GOD
ACTUALLY
GIVES
MOSES
THE
TWO
TABLETS
WITH
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTSDISCOURSES
WRITTEN
ON
THEM
I
BREAK
THESE
TEN
DOWN
AS
FOLLOWS
AND
IN
MOST
CASES
EACH
OF
THESE
PASSAGES
BEGINS
WITH
SOME
VARIATION
OF
THE
PHRASE
AND
THE
LORD
SPOKE
TO
MOSES
SAYING
THE
EXCEPTION
IS
EX
WHICH
BEGINS
NOW
THESE
ARE
THE
ORDINANCES
WHICH
YOU
ARE
TO
SET
BEFORE
THEM
THE
WORD
TRANSLATED
COMMANDMENTS
IN
THE
PHRASE
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
ISNT
REALLY
THE
WORD
FOR
COMMANDMENT
ITS
THE
WORD
FOR
A
SPEECH
OR
AN
UTTERANCE
ITS
A
WORD
OFTEN
USED
FOR
LONGER
DISCOURSES
RATHER
THAN
INDIVIDUAL
STATEMENTS
FOR
INSTANCE
WHEN
COMBINED
WITH
THE
WORD
YOM
DAY
THIS
WORD
IS
TRANSLATED
CHRONICLES
IN
SUCH
PHRASES
AS
NOW
THE
REST
OF
THE
ACTS
OF
SOANDSO
ARE
THEY
NOT
WRITTEN
IN
THE
CHRONICLES
OF
X
THE
WORD
FOR
COMMANDMENT
IS
FREELY
USED
THROUGHOUT
THE
BOOKS
OF
MOSES
AND
PERHAPS
IT
IS
SIGNIFICANT
THAT
WHEN
MOSES
SPOKE
OF
THE
TEN
XS
HE
APPEARS
TO
HAVE
AVOIDED
THE
WORD
FOR
COMMANDMENT
AND
CHOSEN
INSTEAD
A
WORD
ASSOCIATED
WITH
DISCOURSES
LONGER
THAN
JUST
A
SINGLE
COMMAND
GOD
TELLS
MOSES
THAT
HE
IS
GOING
TO
GIVE
HIM
THE
STONE
TABLETS
WITH
THE
LAW
AND
THE
COMMANDMENTS
EX
YET
HE
DOES
NOT
GIVE
MOSES
THE
TABLETS
UNTIL
HE
HAS
FINISHED
ALL
TEN
DISCOURSES
ON
MOUNT
SINAI
IF
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
WERE
ONLY
EX
IT
IS
NOT
IMMEDIATELY
CLEAR
WHY
GOD
WOULD
WAIT
SEVERAL
DAYS
AND
NINE
MORE
DISCOURSES
BEFORE
GIVING
THESE
TABLETS
TO
MOSES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
WE
HAVE
THE
TEN
DISCOURSES
WRITTEN
ON
THE
TABLETS
THEN
IT
MAKES
PERFECT
SENSE
THAT
GOD
WOULD
NOT
GIVE
MOSES
THE
TABLETS
UNTIL
HE
HAD
FINISHED
DELIVERING
ALL
TEN
DISCOURSES
WHEN
MOSES
DID
GET
THE
TABLETS
HE
FOUND
THAT
BOTH
TABLETS
WERE
WRITTEN
ON
BOTH
SIDES
EX
IF
THESE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
WERE
ONLY
THE
FIRST
VERSES
OF
EX
GOD
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
HAVE
WRITTEN
IN
LARGE
LETTERS
NOT
THAT
HE
COULDNT
HAVE
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
DOES
SEEM
MORE
LIKELY
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
IS
A
REFERENCE
TO
TWO
TABLETS
CONTAINING
TEN
DISCOURSES
WRITTEN
IN
NORMAL
SIZED
LETTERS
IN
II
COR
PAUL
SEEMS
TO
SPECIFICALLY
SINGLE
OUT
THE
COMMANDMENTS
WRITTEN
ON
STONE
AS
BEING
THE
MINISTRY
OF
DEATH
THAT
WHICH
IS
FADING
AWAY
AND
THE
MINISTRY
OF
CONDEMNATION
WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
EXCEPTION
OF
THE
COMMANDMENT
ABOUT
THE
SABBATH
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
WHY
PAUL
WOULD
REFER
TO
THE
COMMANDS
IN
EX
AS
BEING
TEMPORARY
FADING
AWAYTYPE
COMMANDMENTS
THIS
IS
LESS
OF
A
PROBLEM
IF
THE
STONE
TABLETS
SHOULD
HAPPEN
TO
HAVE
INCLUDED
ALL
OF
THE
COMMANDMENTS
FROM
EX
THROUGH
EX
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
THIS
IDEA
THE
MAIN
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
THIS
IDEA
ASIDE
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
CONTRADICTS
A
LONGSTANDING
TRADITION
IS
THAT
IN
DT
MOSES
SAYS
AFTER
QUOTING
THE
COMMANDS
IN
EX
THESE
WORDS
THE
LORD
SPOKEAND
HE
ADDED
NO
MORE
AND
HE
WROTE
THEM
ON
TWO
TABLETS
OF
STONE
AND
GAVE
THEM
TO
ME
THIS
APPEARS
TO
IDENTIFY
THE
WORDS
JUST
QUOTED
AS
BEING
THE
ONLY
CONTENTS
OF
THE
TWO
STONE
TABLETS
THAT
WAS
MY
FIRST
IMPRESSION
ANYWAY
HOWEVER
AFTER
SOME
THOUGHT
I
NOTED
THAT
A
GREAT
DEAL
HINGES
ON
HOW
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THE
PHRASE
THESE
WORDS
IF
MOSES
MEANT
THESE
WORDS
WHICH
I
HAVE
JUST
RELATED
TO
YOU
WERE
SPOKEN
BY
GOD
ETC
THEN
THAT
WOULD
MEAN
THAT
ONLY
THE
TRADITIONAL
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
WERE
ON
THE
STONE
TABLETS
IF
HOWEVER
MOSES
WAS
MAKING
A
PARENTHETICAL
COMMENTTHESE
WORDS
WHICH
I
AM
NOW
TELLING
YOU
WERE
SPOKEN
BY
GOD
ETCTHEN
THATS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
I
DID
NOTE
THAT
IN
THE
DT
ACCOUNT
MOSES
TELLS
OF
BEING
GIVEN
THE
STONE
TABLETS
BEFORE
TELLING
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ASKING
MOSES
TO
REPRESENT
THEM
BEFORE
GOD
WHEREAS
IN
THE
EXODUS
ACCOUNT
THE
PEOPLE
ASKED
THIS
OF
MOSES
BETWEEN
THE
FIRST
AND
SECOND
DISCOURSES
SEVERAL
DAYS
BEFORE
GOD
GAVE
MOSES
THE
STONE
TABLETS
THIS
REINFORCES
THE
IDEA
THAT
MOSES
REMARKS
IN
DT
WERE
INTENDED
AS
A
PARENTHETICAL
REMARK
RATHER
THAN
A
STRICTLY
CHRONOLOGICAL
ACCOUNT
OF
WHEN
GOD
WROTE
WHAT
AND
AT
WHAT
POINT
HE
STOPPED
ADDING
TO
WHAT
WAS
ON
THE
TABLETS
SUMMARY
ALL
THINGS
CONSIDERED
I
FIND
IT
SOMEWHAT
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
THE
NINE
COMMANDS
IN
EX
ARE
REALLY
ONLY
THE
FIRST
OF
WHAT
MOSES
REGARDED
AS
THE
TEN
DISCOURSES
OF
GOD
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
EVER
ESPOUSED
THIS
IDEA
BEFORE
ITS
BRANDNEW
TO
ME
SO
WHILE
I
LEAN
TOWARDS
ACCEPTING
IT
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
INTERESTED
IN
HEARING
ANY
COMMENTS
AND
CRITICISMS
ANYONE
MAY
CARE
TO
OFFER
MARK
