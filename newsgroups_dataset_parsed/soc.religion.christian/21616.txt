RE
MAJOR
VIEWS
OF
THE
TRINITY
IN
ARTICLE
YOU
WRITE
I
FEAR
ORTHODOX
THEOLOGIANS
HAVE
BEEN
OVERLY
IN
LOVE
WITH
PARADOX
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
WELLMEANING
PEOPLE
THINK
THEYVE
JUST
FLATOUT
CONFUSED
THERES
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THINGS
BEING
BOTH
AND
EG
IF
THE
ARE
DIFFERENT
PARTS
OF
THE
BUT
THEYRE
IN
SOME
WAY
DIFFERENT
ASPECTS
MODES
OR
WHATEVER
OF
ONE
GOD
IF
YOU
ACCEPT
ECONOMIC
TRINITARIANISM
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
ANY
SUBSTANTIVE
DIFFERENCE
WITH
THE
STANDARD
VIEW
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
YOU
JUST
DONT
FIND
THE
NEOPLATONIC
EXPLANATION
ILLUMINATING
CLH
I
WOULD
PUT
IT
STRONGER
THAN
THAT
I
CONSIDER
IT
NONSENSE
SIMPLY
PUT
I
DO
NOT
SEE
ANY
WAY
THAT
A
PLATONIC
ESSENCE
COULD
HAVE
ANY
REAL
EXISTANCE
ESSENCE
IN
THE
PLATONIC
SENSE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ANY
REFERENT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
IT
IS
JUST
AN
IMAGINARY
CONCEPT
INVENTED
TO
PROVIDE
AN
EXPLANATION
FOR
THINGS
BETTER
EXPLAINED
IN
OTHER
WAYS
SO
TO
ATTRIBUTE
AN
ESSENCE
TO
GOD
IS
TO
ATTRIBUTE
TO
HIM
SOMETHING
THAT
DOES
NOT
EXIST
THUS
THE
ORTHODOX
PLATONIC
FORMULATION
SEEMS
TO
LEAVE
THE
UNITY
OF
GOD
IN
LIMBO
SINCE
IT
IS
BASED
ON
A
NONEXISTANT
ESSENCE
THUS
FAILING
TO
AVOID
THE
VERY
PROBLEM
IT
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
ADDRESS
THUS
TO
ME
THE
UNITY
OF
GOD
MUST
BE
PRIMARY
AND
THE
TRIALITY
MUST
BE
SECONDARY
MUST
BE
MODAL
OR
ASPECTUAL
RELATING
TO
ROLES
OR
TO
MODES
OF
INTERACTION
SINCE
OTHERWISE
THERE
IS
NO
MEANING
TO
SAYING
GOD
IS
ONE
SARIMATERADATACOM
FORMERLY
TDATIRVSARIMA
OR
STANLEYFRIESENELSEGUNDOCANCRCOM
I
THINK
ONE
CAN
READ
AUGUSTINE
AS
SAYING
SOMETHING
CONSISTENT
WITH
YOUR
COMMENTS
HIS
DE
TRINITATE
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
VERY
INFLUENTIAL
IN
THE
WEST
DEFINES
THE
DISTINCTION
AMONG
THE
PERSONS
RELATIONALLY
YOURE
PROBABLY
AT
ONE
EXTREME
OF
ORTHODOX
VIEWS
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
YOUR
VIEWS
ARE
NECESSARY
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
THE
TRINITY
