RE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
I
WROTE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
DLECOINTGARNETACNSFSUEDU
DARIUSLECOINTE
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
HOW
MUCH
MORE
NEEDS
TO
BE
SAID
OTHER
THAN
THE
FAQ
I
THINK
PAULS
COMMENTS
ON
ESTEEMING
ONE
DAY
OVER
ANOTHER
ROM
IS
PROBABLY
ALL
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
SAID
WAS
PAUL
A
GOD
TOO
IS
AN
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
WORDS
OF
PAUL
OF
HIGHER
PRIORITY
THAN
THE
DIRECT
WORD
OF
JESUS
IN
PAUL
BEGINS
ROMANS
WITH
IF
SOMEONE
IS
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
DO
YOU
COUNT
YOURSELF
AS
ONE
WHO
IS
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
I
ACCEPT
THAT
DARIUS
IS
DOING
WHAT
HE
DOES
IN
HONOR
OF
THE
LORD
I
JUST
WISH
HE
MIGHT
EQUALLY
ACCEPT
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ESTEEM
ALL
DAYS
ALIKE
ARE
SIMILARLY
DOING
THEIR
BEST
TO
HONOR
THE
LORD
YES
BUT
WHAT
DOES
THE
BIBLE
HAVE
TO
SAY
WHAT
DID
JESUS
SAY
PAUL
CLOSES
ROMANS
WITH
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
PERSON
WITH
DOUBTS
ABOUT
SOMETHING
WHO
EATS
IT
ANYWAY
IS
GUILTY
BECAUSE
HE
ISNT
ACTING
ON
HIS
FAITH
AND
ANY
FAILURE
TO
ACT
ON
FAITH
IS
A
SIN
GAUS
HAVE
YOU
READ
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
WHICH
ARE
A
PORTION
OF
THE
LAW
HAVE
YOU
READ
JESUS
WORD
IN
IS
THERE
ANY
DOUBT
IN
YOUR
MIND
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
AND
WHAT
IS
SIN
GREEK
HAMARTIA
MISSING
THE
MARK
HOWEVER
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
CLEAR
THAT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THERES
UNAMBIGUOUS
PROOF
THAT
REGULAR
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
WAS
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
AS
I
INDICATED
THERE
ARE
RESPONSES
ON
BOTH
OF
THE
PASSAGES
CITED
WHEREAS
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
AND
JESUS
WORDS
IN
ARE
FAIRLY
CLEAR
ARE
THEY
NOT
THE
DIFFICULTY
WITH
BOTH
OF
THESE
PASSAGES
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
ACTUALLY
ABOUT
SOMETHING
ELSE
THEY
BOTH
LOOK
LIKE
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
NNREGULAR
CHRISTIAN
MEETINGS
BUT
NEITHER
EXPLICITLY
SAYS
AND
THEY
GATHERED
EVERY
SUNDAY
FOR
WORSHIP
WE
GET
VARIOUS
PIECES
OF
INFORMATION
BUT
NOTHING
AIMED
AT
ANSWERING
THIS
QUESTION
DOESNT
ANSWER
YOUR
QUESTION
WHAT
DAY
CHRISTIANS
MET
IN
THEIR
HOUSES
ACTS
DESPITE
DARIUS
CONFUSION
IS
DESCRIBED
BY
ACTS
AS
OCCURING
ON
SUNDAY
IT
DOESNT
SAY
THEY
GATHERED
TO
SEE
PAUL
OFF
BUT
THAT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
GATHERED
FOR
BREAKING
BREAD
BREAKING
BREAD
ROUGHLY
SYNONYMOUS
WITH
EATING
SO
I
THINK
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
READING
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
EVERY
WEEK
SIMPLY
MEANS
EVERY
TIME
THEY
GATHER
FOR
WORSHIP
HOW
DO
YOU
UNITE
THIS
CONCEPT
OF
YOURS
WITH
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
AND
JESUSS
WORD
IN
I
THINK
THE
REASON
WE
HAVE
ONLY
IMPLICATIONS
AND
NOT
CLEAR
STATEMENTS
IS
THAT
THE
NT
AUTHORS
ASSUMED
THAT
THEIR
READERS
KNEW
WHEN
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
WAS
CLH
OR
THEY
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
AND
JESUS
WORD
IN
ACTUALLY
STOOD
FOR
SOMETHING
PERHAPS
THEY
WERE
STRONG
IN
THE
FAITH
NO
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
PAUL
CAN
OVERRULE
GOD
HOWEVER
PAUL
WAS
WRITING
FOR
A
LARGELY
GENTILE
AUDIENCE
THE
LAW
WAS
REGARDED
BY
JEWS
AT
THE
TIME
AND
NOW
AS
BINDING
ON
JEWS
BUT
NOT
ON
GENTILES
THERE
ARE
RULES
THAT
WERE
BINDING
ON
ALL
HUMAN
BEINGS
THE
SOCALLED
NOACHIC
LAWS
BUT
THEY
ARE
QUITE
MINIMAL
THE
ISSUE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
HAD
TO
FACE
AFTER
JESUS
DEATH
WAS
WHAT
TO
DO
ABOUT
GENTILES
WHO
WANTED
TO
FOLLOW
CHRIST
THE
DECISION
NOT
TO
IMPOSE
THE
LAW
ON
THEM
DIDNT
SAY
THAT
THE
LAW
WAS
ABOLISHED
IT
SIMPLY
ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT
FACT
THAT
IT
DIDNT
APPLY
TO
GENTILES
THUS
THERE
IS
NO
CONTRADICTION
WITH
MAT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
BOTH
PAUL
AND
OTHER
JEWISH
CHRISTIANS
DID
CONTINUE
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
JEWISH
WORSHIP
ON
THE
SABBATH
THUS
THEY
CONTINUED
TO
OBEY
THE
LAW
THE
ISSUE
WAS
AND
IS
WITH
GENTILE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
ARE
NOT
COVERED
BY
THE
LAW
OR
AT
LEAST
NOT
BY
THE
CEREMONIAL
ASPECTS
OF
IT
JESUS
DEALT
MOSTLY
WITH
JEWS
I
THINK
WE
CAN
REASONABLY
ASSUME
THAT
MAT
WAS
DIRECTED
TO
A
JEWISH
AUDIENCE
HE
DID
INTERACT
WITH
GENTILES
A
FEW
TIMES
EG
THE
CENTURION
WHOSE
SLAVE
WAS
HEALED
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
OTHERS
THE
TERMS
USED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
CENTURION
SEE
LUKE
SUGGEST
THAT
HE
WAS
A
GODFEARER
IE
A
GENTILE
WHO
FOLLOWED
GOD
BUT
HAD
NOT
ADOPTED
THE
WHOLE
JEWISH
LAW
HE
WAS
COMMENDED
BY
JEWISH
ELDERS
AS
A
WORTHY
PERSON
AND
JESUS
ACCEPTED
HIM
AS
SUCH
THIS
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
INDICATE
THAT
JESUS
ACCEPTED
THE
PREVAILING
VIEW
THAT
GENTILES
NEED
NOT
ACCEPT
THE
LAW
HOWEVER
THERES
MORE
INVOLVED
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
COMPARE
JESUS
AND
PAUL
ON
THE
LAW
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
A
FULL
PICTURE
OF
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
LAW
WE
HAVE
TO
COME
TO
GRIPS
WITH
PAULS
APPARENT
REJECTION
OF
THE
LAW
AND
HOW
THAT
RELATES
TO
JESUS
COMMENDATION
OF
THE
LAW
AT
LEAST
AS
I
READ
PAUL
HE
SAYS
THAT
THE
LAW
SERVES
A
PURPOSE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
IN
A
CERTAIN
SENSE
SUPERCEDED
AGAIN
THIS
ISSUE
ISNT
ONE
OF
THE
ABOLITION
OF
THE
LAW
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
HIS
DISCUSSION
PAUL
NOTES
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
UNDERSTOOD
THIS
WAY
AND
ASSURES
US
THAT
THATS
NOT
WHAT
HE
INTENDS
TO
SAY
RATHER
HE
SEES
THE
LAW
AS
PRIMARILY
BEING
PRESENT
TO
CONVICT
PEOPLE
OF
THEIR
SINFULNESS
BUT
ULTIMATELY
ITS
AN
IMPOSSIBLE
STANDARD
AND
ONE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
SUPERCEDED
BY
CHRIST
PAULS
COMMENTS
ARE
NOT
THE
WORLDS
CLEAREST
HERE
AND
NOT
EVERYONE
AGREES
WITH
MY
READING
BUT
THE
INTERESTING
THING
TO
NOTICE
IS
THAT
EVEN
THIS
RADICAL
POSITION
DOES
NOT
ENTAIL
AN
ABOLITION
OF
THE
LAW
IT
STILL
REMAINS
AS
AN
UNCOMPROMISING
STANDARD
FROM
WHICH
NOT
AN
IOTA
OR
DOT
MAY
BE
REMOVED
FOR
ITS
PURPOSE
OF
CONVICTING
OF
SIN
ITS
IMPORTANT
THAT
IT
NOT
BE
RELAXED
HOWEVER
FOR
CHRISTIANS
ITS
NOT
THE
END
ULTIMATELY
WE
LIVE
IN
FAITH
NOT
LAW
WHILE
THE
THEORETICAL
CATEGORIES
THEY
USE
ARE
RATHER
DIFFERENT
IN
THE
END
I
THINK
JESUS
AND
PAUL
COME
TO
A
RATHER
SIMILAR
CONCLUSION
THE
QUOTED
PASSAGE
FROM
MAT
SHOULD
BE
TAKEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
REST
OF
THE
SERMON
ON
THE
MOUNT
WHERE
JESUS
SHOWS
US
HOW
HE
INTERPRETS
THE
LAW
THE
NOT
AN
IOTA
OR
DOT
WOULD
SUGGEST
A
RATHER
LITERAL
READING
BUT
IN
FACT
THATS
NOT
JESUS
APPROACH
JESUS
INTERPRETATIONS
EMPHASIZE
THE
INTENT
OF
THE
LAW
AND
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THE
CEREMONIAL
DETAILS
INDEED
HE
IS
WELL
KNOWN
FOR
TAKING
A
RATHER
FREE
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
THE
SABBATH
AND
KOSHER
LAWS
SOME
SCHOLARS
CLAIM
THAT
MAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
TAKEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
CENT
JEWISH
DISCUSSIONS
JESUS
ACCUSES
HIS
OPPONENTS
OF
CARING
ABOUT
GIVING
A
TENTH
OF
EVEN
THE
MOST
MINOR
HERBS
BUT
NEGLECTING
THE
THINGS
THAT
REALLY
MATTER
JUSTICE
MERCY
AND
FAITH
AND
CARING
ABOUT
HOW
CUPS
AND
PLATES
ARE
CLEANED
BUT
NOT
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
INSIDE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
USE
THEM
ARE
FULL
OF
EXTORTION
AND
RAPACITY
MAT
THIS
AND
THE
DISCUSSION
LATER
IN
MAT
SUGGEST
THAT
JESUS
HAS
A
VERY
SPECIFIC
VIEW
OF
THE
LAW
IN
MIND
AND
THAT
WHEN
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
MAINTAINING
THE
LAW
IN
ITS
FULL
STRENGTH
HE
IS
THINKING
OF
THESE
ASPECTS
OF
IT
PAULS
CONCLUSION
IS
SIMILAR
WHILE
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LAW
BEING
SUPERCEDED
ALL
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
HE
GIVES
INVOLVE
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
SUCH
AS
CIRCUMCISION
AND
THE
SABBATH
HE
IS
QUITE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
MAINTAINING
MORAL
STANDARDS
THE
NET
RESULT
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
WHEN
PAUL
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LAW
BEING
SUPERCEDED
AND
JESUS
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LAW
BEING
MAINTAINED
I
BELIEVE
THEY
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
DIFFERENT
ASPECTS
OF
THE
LAW
PAUL
IS
EMBROILED
IN
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
CIRCUMCISION
AS
IS
NATURAL
IN
LETTERS
RESPONDING
TO
SPECIFIC
SITUATIONS
HES
LOOKING
AT
THE
ASPECT
OF
THE
LAW
THAT
IS
CURRENTLY
CAUSING
TROUBLE
THE
LAW
AS
SPECIFICALLY
JEWISH
CEREMONIES
HE
CERTAINLY
DOES
NOT
INTEND
TO
ABOLISH
DIVINE
STANDARDS
OF
CONDUCT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WHEN
JESUS
COMMENDS
THE
LAW
HE
SEEMS
TO
BE
TALKING
THE
LAW
IN
ITS
BROADEST
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
MORALS
AND
HUMAN
RELATIONSHIPS
AND
DEEMPHASIZING
THOSE
ASPECTS
THAT
WERE
LATER
TO
GIVE
PAUL
SO
MUCH
TROUBLE
ITS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
PEOPLE
USE
THE
SAME
TERMS
IN
DIFFERENT
WAYS
BUT
WE
SHOULD
BE
FAMILIAR
WITH
THAT
FROM
CURRENT
CONFLICTS
LOOK
AT
THE
WAY
TERMS
LIKE
FAMILY
VALUES
TAKE
ON
SPECIAL
MEANING
FROM
THE
CURRENT
CONTEXT
IMAGINE
SOME
POOR
HISTORIAN
OF
THE
FUTURE
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
FAMILY
VALUES
SHOULD
BE
USED
AS
A
CODE
WORD
FOR
OPPOSITION
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
ONE
SPECIFIC
PERIOD
IN
THE
US
I
THINK
LAW
HAD
TAKEN
ON
A
SIMILAR
ROLE
IN
THE
ARGUMENTS
PAUL
WAS
INVOLVED
IN
PAUL
WAS
CLEARLY
NOT
REJECTING
ALL
OF
THE
JEWISH
VALUES
THAT
GO
ALONG
WITH
THE
TERM
LAW
ANY
MORE
THAN
PEOPLE
WHO
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
FAMILY
VALUES
MOVEMENT
ARE
REALLY
OPPOSED
TO
FAMILY
VALUES
