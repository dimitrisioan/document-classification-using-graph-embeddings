did
he
really
rise

and
the
two
simplest
refutations
are
these
what
impact
the
only
record
of
impact
comes
from
the
new
testament
i
have
no
guarantee
that
its
books
are
in
the
least
accurate
and
that
the
recorded
impact
actually
happened
i
find
it
interesting
that
no
other
contemporary
source
records
an
eclipse
an
earthquake
a
temple
curtain
being
torn
etc
the
earliest
written
claim
we
have
of
jesus
resurrection
is
from
the
pauline
epistles
none
of
which
were
written
sooner
than
years
after
the
supposed
event
first
off
id
say
that
the
impact
if
right
before
your
eyes
that
we
are
even
discussing
this
is
a
major
impact
in
and
of
itself
further
the
early
church
bears
testimony
to
the
impact
it
seems
probable
that
no
one
displayed
the
body
of
jesus
because
no
one
knew
where
it
was
i
personally
believe
that
the
most
likely
explanation
was
that
the
body
was
stolen
by
disciples
or
by
graverobbers
dont
bother
with
the
point
about
the
guards
it
only
appears
in
one
gospel
and
seems
like
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
early
christians
might
make
up
in
order
to
counter
the
graverobbing
charge
the
new
testament
does
record
that
jews
believed
the
body
had
been
stolen
if
there
were
really
guards
they
could
not
have
effectively
made
this
claim
as
they
did
of
course
they
knew
where
it
was
dont
forget
that
jesus
was
seen
by
both
the
jews
and
the
romans
as
a
troublemaker
pilate
was
no
fool
and
didnt
need
the
additional
headaches
of
some
fishermen
stealing
jesus
body
to
make
it
appear
he
had
arisen
since
jesus
was
buried
in
the
grave
of
a
man
well
know
to
the
sanhedrin
to
say
that
they
didnt
know
where
he
was
buried
begs
the
question
now
you
say
that
you
think
that
the
disciples
stole
the
body
but
think
on
this
a
moment
would
you
die
to
maintain
something
you
knew
to
be
a
deliberate
lie
if
not
then
why
do
you
think
the
disciples
would
now
im
not
talking
about
dying
for
something
you
firmly
believe
to
be
the
truth
but
unbeknown
to
you
it
is
a
lie
many
have
done
this
no
im
talking
about
dying
by
beheading
stoning
crucifixion
etc
for
something
you
know
to
be
a
lie
thus
you
position
with
regards
to
the
disciples
stealing
the
body
seems
rather
lightweight
to
me
as
for
graverobbers
why
risk
the
severe
penalties
for
grave
robbing
over
the
body
of
jesus
he
wasnt
buried
with
great
riches
so
again
this
is
an
argument
that
can
be
discounted
that
leaves
you
back
on
square
one
what
happened
to
the
body
ihl

the
opinions
expressed
are
not
necessarily
those
of
the

at

the

office

technology
or
the
experimental

or
again
let
me
comment
that
the
most
plausible
nonchristian
scenario
and
the
one
typically
suggested
by
sceptics
who
are
knowledgeable
about
the
nt
is
that
the
resurrection
was
a
subjective
event
and
the
empty
tomb
stories
are
a
result
of
accounts
growing
in
the
telling
