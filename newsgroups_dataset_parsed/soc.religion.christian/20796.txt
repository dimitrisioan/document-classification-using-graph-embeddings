re
harrassed
at
work
could
use
some
prayers
id
just
like
to
repeat
and
emphasize
that
because
someone
else
is
trying
to
make
you
feel
horrible
and
worthless
does
not
mean
that
you
should
feel
that
way
although
thats
easier
to
say
than
believe
sometimes
remember
god
made
you
and
loves
you
so
he
must
think
youre
something
special
excuse
the
trite
language
here
also
the
bully
may
just
be
someone
who
is
mean
for
no
reason
not
out
of
intentional
mental
torture
has
anyone
else
been
harassed
maybe
theyre
just
not
talking
about
it
i
would
have
emailed
but
my
reactions
werent
fast
enough
and
the
post
im
responding
to
didnt
include
your
address
just
take
courage
and
remember
that
all
of
us
on
the
net
are
rooting
for
you
take
care
vera
hand
over
hand
noyemidwayuchicagoedu
doesnt
seem
so
much
vera
noyes
hand
over
hand
is
the
strength
of
the
common
touch
drop
me
a
line
if
youre
in
the
mood
rush
hand
over
fist
