JOHN
E
MURRAY
WRITES
EXAMPLE
LAST
SUNDAY
PALM
SUNDAY
WE
WENT
TO
THE
LOCAL
CHURCH
USUALLY
ON
PALM
SUNDAY
THE
CONGREGATION
PARTICIPATES
IN
READING
THE
PASSION
TAKING
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
MOB
THE
THEOLOGY
BEHIND
THIS
SEEMS
PROFOUNDWHEN
WE
SAY
CRUCIFY
HIM
WE
MEAN
IT
WE
DID
IT
AND
IF
HE
CAME
BACK
TODAY
WED
DO
IT
AGAIN
IT
ALWAYS
GIVES
ME
CHILLS
BUT
LAST
WEEK
WE
WERE
INVITED
TO
SIT
DURING
THE
GOSPEL
PASSION
AND
LISTEN
BESIDES
THE
ORWELLIAN
INVITATION
ON
PALM
SUNDAY
AT
OUR
PARISH
WE
WERE
INVITED
TO
TAKE
THE
ROLE
OF
JESUS
IN
THE
PASSION
I
DECLINED
TO
PARTICIPATE
LAST
YEAR
AT
THE
LITURGY
MEETING
I
POINTED
OUT
HOW
WE
CRUCIFY
CHRIST
BY
OUR
SINS
SO
THEREFORE
IT
IS
APPROPRIATE
THAT
WE
RETAIN
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
CROWD
BUT
TO
NO
AVAIL
MUSICIANS
READERS
AND
SO
ON
NEW
THINGS
ARE
INTRODUCED
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
LITURGY
AND
SINCE
NO
ONE
KNOWS
WHATS
HAPPENING
THE
NEW
THINGS
HAVE
TO
BE
EXPLAINED
AND
PRETTY
SOON
INSTEAD
OF
DOING
A
LOT
OF
THE
MASS
WERE
JUST
SITTING
THERE
LISTENING
OR
SPACING
OUT
IN
MY
CASE
TO
HOW
THE
MASS
IS
ABOUT
TO
BE
DONE
IN
MY
MIND
I
LAY
THE
BLAME
ON
LITURGY
COMMITTEES
MADE
UP
OF
LAY
EXPERTS
BUT
THAT
MAY
NOT
BE
JUST
I
DO
THINK
THAT
A
LITURGY
COMMITTEE
HAS
A
BIAS
TOWARD
DOING
SOMETHING
RATHER
THAN
NOTHINGTHATS
JUST
A
FACT
OF
BUREAUCRATIC
LIFEEVEN
THOUGH
A
SIMPLER
LITURGY
MAY
IN
FACT
MAKE
IT
EASIER
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
BE
AWARE
OF
THE
LORDS
PRESENCE
AS
A
MEMBER
OF
A
LITURGY
COMMITTEE
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
CERTAIN
PEOPLE
DOMINATING
WHO
WANT
TO
TRY
OUT
ALL
KINDS
OF
INNOVATIONS
THE
PRIESTS
DONT
SEEM
EVEN
TO
WANT
TO
MAKE
ANY
DECISIONS
OF
THEIR
OWN
IN
MANY
CASES
I
GUESS
ITS
EASIER
TO
TRY
SOMETHING
NEW
THAN
IT
IS
TO
REFUSE
TO
ALLOW
IT
AT
OUR
PARISH
ON
HOLY
THURSDAY
INSTEAD
OF
THE
PRIESTS
WASHING
FEET
WHO
WANTS
TO
GET
AROUND
PEOPLES
FEET
ACCORDING
TO
ONE
OF
OUR
PRIESTS
THE
CONGREGATION
WAS
INVITED
TO
COME
UP
AND
HELP
WASH
ONE
ANOTHERS
HANDS
THE
SYMBOLISM
OF
THIS
ACTION
DISTRESSED
ME
AND
AGAIN
I
REFUSED
TO
PARTICIPATE
I
THOUGHT
THAT
IF
WE
WERE
TO
HAVE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
RUBRICS
FOR
THIS
LITURGICAL
ACTION
IE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
AMEN
FOR
RECEIVING
COMMUNION
THAT
THEY
COULD
BE
I
AM
NOT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
BLOOD
OF
THIS
MAN
ALSO
FOR
PART
OF
THE
EUCHARISTIC
PRAYER
BLESSED
ARE
YOU
GOD
OF
ALL
CREATION
WAS
SUBSTITUTED
SOME
TEXT
READ
BY
A
LAY
COUPLE
THE
PRIEST
CERTAINLY
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
GIVEN
THIS
PART
OF
THE
MASS
OVER
TO
OTHERS
AND
I
WAS
SO
DISTURBED
THAT
I
DECLINED
TO
RECEIVE
COMMUNION
THAT
NIGHT
WE
ARENT
REQUIRED
TO
ANYWAY
I
INSTEAD
OFFERED
UP
PRAYERS
FOR
OUR
PRIESTS
AND
PARISH
SO
WEVE
BEEN
WONDERINGARE
WE
THE
ODDBALLS
OR
IS
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
MASS
GOING
DOWN
I
DONT
MEAN
THAT
FACETIOUSLY
WE
GO
TO
MASS
EVERY
THURSDAY
OR
FRIDAY
AND
ARE
REMINDED
OF
THE
POWER
OF
A
VERY
SIMPLE
LITURGY
TO
MAKE
US
AWARE
OF
GODS
PRESENCE
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
THE
OBLIGATORY
SUNDAY
MASSESMAYBE
I
SHOULD
JUST
OFFER
IT
UP
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
NOTICED
DECLINING
CONGREGATIONAL
PARTICIPATION
IN
CATHOLIC
MASSES
LATELY
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
MASS
HAS
NOT
CHANGED
AGAIN
IF
IT
WERE
TO
BE
CELEBRATED
ACCORDING
TO
THE
RUBRICS
SET
DOWN
BY
THE
CHURCH
IT
WOULD
STILL
BE
LITURGICALLY
BEAUTIFUL
THE
PROBLEM
COMES
ABOUT
FROM
PEOPLE
TRYING
TO
BE
CREATIVE
WHO
ARE
NOT
I
THINK
THE
ANSWER
TO
YOUR
QUESTION
ON
PARTICIPATION
COULD
BE
THAT
GIVEN
BY
FATHER
PETER
STRAVINSKAS
IN
ANSWER
TO
THE
QUESTION
POSED
BY
THE
TITLE
OF
THOMAS
DAYS
WHY
CATHOLICS
CANT
SING
THEY
DONT
WANT
TO
BECAUSE
OF
ALL
THIS
NONSENSE
BY
THE
WAY
FOR
ANY
NONCATHOLICS
READING
THIS
THE
PROBLEM
DOES
NOT
REFLECT
BAD
LITURGY
BY
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
BUT
BY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
DISOBEDIENT
TO
THE
CHURCH
IN
CHANGING
IT
ON
THEIR
OWN
AUTHORITY
