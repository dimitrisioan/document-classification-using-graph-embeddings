CHRISTIANS
NEED
FOR
CHRISTIANITY
WAS
IN
ARTICLE
MUSSACKAUSTINIBMCOM
WRITES
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
WHETHER
THERE
IS
A
WHY
OR
NOT
WE
HAVE
TO
FIND
IT
THIS
IS
PASCALS
WAGER
IF
THERE
IS
NO
WHY
AND
WE
SPEND
OUR
LIVES
SEARCHING
THEN
WE
HAVE
MERELY
WASTED
OUR
LIVES
WHICH
WERE
MEANINGLESS
ANYWAY
IF
THERE
IS
A
WHY
AND
WE
SUPPOSE
THE
UNIVERSE
IS
BILLION
YEARS
OLD
AND
SUPPOSE
IT
LASTS
ANOTHER
BILLION
YEARS
SUPPOSE
I
LIVE
TO
BE
THAT
IS
NOTHING
THAT
IS
SO
SMALL
THAT
IT
IS
SCARY
SO
BY
SEARCHING
FOR
THE
WHY
ALONG
WITH
MY
FRIENDS
HERE
ON
EARTH
IF
NOTHING
ELSE
WE
ARENT
SO
SCARED
I
FIND
THIS
VIEW
OF
CHRISTIANITY
TO
BE
QUITE
DISHEARTENING
AND
SAD
THE
IDEA
THAT
LIFE
ONLY
HAS
MEANING
OR
IMPORTANCE
IF
THERE
IS
A
CREATOR
DOES
NOT
SEEM
LIKE
MUCH
OF
A
BASIS
FOR
BELIEF
AND
THE
LOGIC
IS
ALSO
APPALLING
GOD
MUST
EXIST
BECAUSE
I
WANT
HIM
TO
I
HAVE
HEARD
THIS
LINE
OF
REASONING
BEFORE
AND
WONDER
HOW
PREVALENT
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
IN
MODERN
SOCIETY
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
CONVINCED
LIFE
IS
HOPELESS
OR
SO
THE
POLLSTERS
AND
NEWSCASTS
STATE
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
WHERE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
BECOME
RELIGIOUS
IF
YOU
WANT
MEANING
WHY
NOT
JUST
JOIN
A
CULT
SUCH
AS
IN
WACO
THE
LEADERS
WILL
GIVE
YOU
THE
SECURITY
BLANKET
YOU
DESIRE
