RE
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
D
ANDREW
BYLER
WRITES
MARK
SCHNITZIUS
WRITES
LITERAL
INTERPRETERS
OF
THE
BIBLE
WILL
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
VIEW
SINCE
THE
BIBLE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
FIRES
OF
HELL
AND
SUCH
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
IVE
ALWAYS
FOUND
CONFUSING
IF
ALL
YOUR
NERVE
ENDINGS
DIE
WITH
YOUR
PHYSICAL
BODY
WHY
WOULD
FLAME
HURT
YOU
HOW
CAN
ONE
WAIL
AND
GNASH
TEETH
WITH
NO
LUNGS
AND
NO
TEETH
ONE
CAN
FEEL
PHYSICAL
PAIN
BY
HAVING
A
BODY
WHICH
IF
YOU
KNOW
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
BODY
IS
WHAT
PEOPLE
WILL
HAVE
AFTER
THE
GREAT
JUDGEMENT
WE
LOOK
FOR
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
AND
THE
LIFE
OF
THE
WORLD
TO
COME
NICENECONSTANTINOPOLITAN
CREED
YOU
WILL
HAVE
BOTH
BODY
AND
SOUL
IN
HELL
EVENTUALLY
NOW
THIS
IS
GETTING
INTERESTING
I
WAS
RAISED
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
BEFORE
BECOMING
AN
ATHEIST
SO
I
HAVE
STATED
THIS
CREED
YOU
QUOTE
NEARLY
EVERY
SUNDAY
UNTIL
I
WAS
ABOUT
FOR
SOME
REASON
I
ALWAYS
TOOK
THE
RESURRECTION
IN
THIS
STATEMENT
TO
MEAN
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
SOUL
BUT
I
GUESS
RESURRECTION
DOES
STRICTLY
MEAN
THE
RAISING
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
BODY
I
HAVE
SOME
QUESTIONS
ON
THIS
POINT
I
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
THE
DESCENT
INTO
HELL
WAS
PRETTY
MUCH
IMMEDIATE
AND
THAT
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
BURNING
IN
HELL
RIGHT
NOW
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
IMPLYING
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
OCCUR
UNTIL
AFTER
THE
GREAT
JUDGEMENT
WHICH
I
READ
AS
MEANING
THE
PROVERBIAL
JUDGMENT
DAY
I
WAS
ALWAYS
A
LITTLE
CONFUSED
ON
THIS
POINT
EVEN
WHEN
I
WAS
WITH
THE
CHURCH
MAYBE
SOMEONE
CAN
CLEAR
IT
UP
FOR
ME
WHERE
WILL
MY
SOUL
WHICH
BY
THE
WAY
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
EXIST
UNTIL
THAT
TIME
WILL
THE
NEW
BODY
I
WILL
HAVE
BE
CREATED
OUT
OF
THE
SAME
ATOMS
THAT
MY
BODY
NOW
IS
MADE
OF
OR
WILL
IT
BE
BUILT
FROM
SCRATCH
MY
PHYSICAL
BODY
NOW
IS
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
AGING
ETC
SO
I
GUESS
MY
NEW
BODY
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
IMMORTAL
SO
IT
CAN
BE
TORTURED
FOR
ALL
ETERNITY
SINCE
I
WILL
HAVE
A
PHYSICAL
BODY
I
ASSUME
IT
WILL
NEED
A
PHYSICAL
PLACE
TO
EXIST
IN
WHERE
IS
THIS
HELL
IN
THE
CENTER
OF
THE
EARTH
DO
YOU
THINK
WE
COULD
FIND
IT
IF
WE
DIG

SCHNITZIEOLACSUCFEDU
UNIV
OF
CENTRAL
FLORIDA
THERE
IS
NOT
COMPLETE
AGREEMENT
ON
THE
DETAILS
OF
THE
AFTERLIFE
I
THINK
THE
MOST
COMMON
VIEW
IS
THAT
FINAL
DISPOSITION
DOES
NOT
OCCUR
UNTIL
A
FINAL
JUDGEMENT
WHICH
IS
STILL
IN
THE
FUTURE
IN
THE
MEANTIME
SOME
BELIEVE
THAT
PEOPLE
SLEEP
UNTIL
THE
FINAL
RESURRECTION
OR
BECAUSE
GOD
IS
ABOVE
TIME
PASS
DIRECTLY
FROM
DEATH
TO
THE
FUTURE
TIME
WHEN
THE
RESURRECTION
OCCURS
WHILE
OTHERS
BELIEVE
THAT
SOULS
HAVE
A
DISEMBODIED
PRERESURRECTION
EXISTENCE
UNTIL
THEN
THERE
ARE
PROBABLY
OTHER
ALTERNATIVES
THAT
IM
OMITTING
THE
NEW
BODY
IS
GENERALLY
CONCEIVED
OF
BEING
IMPLEMENTED
IN
A
DIFFERENT
TECHNOLOGY
THAN
THE
CURRENT
ONE
ONE
WHICH
IS
NOT
MORTAL
PAUL
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
MORTAL
BEING
RAISED
TO
IMMORTALITY
AND
JESUS
RESURRECTED
BODY
WHICH
IS
THE
FIRST
EXAMPLE
CLEARLY
WAS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
LIMITATIONS
AS
OURS
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THERE
ARE
ENOUGH
SIMILARITIES
THAT
PEOPLE
WILL
RECOGNIZE
EACH
OTHER
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
MOST
PEOPLE
CLAIM
TO
KNOW
THE
DETAILS
I
DONT
THINK
ID
SAY
ITS
THE
SAME
ATOMS
ID
ASSUME
THERE
WOULD
BE
SOME
ANALOG
OF
A
PHYSICAL
PLACE
BUT
I
WOULDNT
EXPECT
TO
FIND
IT
UNDER
THE
EARTH
OR
UP
IN
THE
SKY
ID
SUSPECT
THAT
ITS
IN
ANOTHER
DIMENSION
OUTSIDE
THIS
PHYSICAL
WORLD
OR
WHATEVER
BUT
AGAIN
WE
HAVE
LITTLE
IN
THE
WAY
OF
DETAILS
