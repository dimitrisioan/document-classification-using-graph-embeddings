re
phone
number
of
wycliffe
translators
uk
im
concerned
about
a
recent
posting
about
wbtsil
i
thought
theyd
pretty
much
been
denounced
as
a
rightwing
organization
involved
in
ideological
manipulation
and
cultural
interference
including
vietnam
and
south
america
a
commission
from
mexican
academia
denounced
them
in
as
a
covert
political
and
ideological
institution
used
by
the
us
govt
as
an
instrument
of
control
regulation
penetration
espionage
and
repression
my
concern
is
that
this
group
may
be
seen
as
acceptable
and
even
praiseworthy
by
readers
of
socreligionchristian
its
important
that
christians
dont
immediately
accept
every
christian
organization
as
automatically
above
reproach
