the
real
problem
was
that
christians
were
pacifist
and
preached
there
was
only
one
god
when
the
state
operates
by
a
system
of
divinitation
of
the

monotheism
becomes
a
capital
offense
the
jews
were
able
to
get
exemption
from
this
and
were
also
not
evangelistic
i
disagree
with
your
claim
that
jews
were
not
evangelistic
except
in
the
narrow
sense
of
the
word
jewish
proselytism
was
widespread
there
are
numerous
accounts
of
jewish
proselytism
both
in
the
new
testament
and
in
roman
and
greek
documents
of
the
day
