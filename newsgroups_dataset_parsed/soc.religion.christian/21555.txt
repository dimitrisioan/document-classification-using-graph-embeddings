AN
QUOTED
ARGUMENT
FOR
THEISM
ON
SUN
MAY
DAMON
WROTE
A
CHRISTIAN
FRIEND
OF
MINE
ONCE
REASONED
THAT
IF
WE
WERE
NEVER
CREATED
WE
COULD
NOT
EXISTS
THEREFORE
WE
WERE
CREATED
AND
THEREFORE
THERE
EXISTS
A
CREATOR
I
HESITATE
TO
COMMENT
ON
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THIS
BECAUSE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
YOUR
FRIEND
MEANT
BY
IT
IF
HE
MEANT
THAT
WHATEVER
EXISTS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
CREATED
THEN
HE
IS
OPEN
TO
THE
OBVIOUS
RETORT
THAT
GOD
EXISTS
AND
SO
GOD
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
CREATED
PERHAPS
YOUR
FRIEND
MEANT
THAT
WE
EXIST
NOW
BUT
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
TIME
WHEN
WE
DID
NOT
EXIST
AND
THEREFORE
SOMETHING
OTHER
THAN
OURSELVES
MUST
HAVE
BROUGHT
US
INTO
EXISTENCE
THIS
SEEMS
PLAUSIBLE
BUT
AN
ATHEIST
MIGHT
REPLY
SO
MY
PARENTS
ENGENDERED
ME
SO
WHAT
HERE
YOUR
FRIEND
WOULD
HAVE
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
AN
INFINITE
REGRESS
OF
CAUSES
IS
NOT
A
SATISFACTORY
EXPLANATION
HE
WOULD
HAVE
SOME
SUPPORT
FROM
PHILOSOPHERS
WHO
ARE
NOT
ORDINARILY
CONSIDERED
RELIGIOUS
AYN
RAND
AND
SOME
OTHERS
WHO
ARE
IN
THE
TRADITION
OF
ARISTOTLE
HAVING
ARGUED
FOR
A
FIRST
CAUSE
HE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BRIDGE
THE
GAP
BETWEEN
SAID
ENTITY
AND
THE
GOD
OF
ABRAHAM
IF
HE
MERELY
ASSERTS
THAT
THE
THINGS
WE
OBSERVE
ARE
ULTIMATELY
DEPENDENT
ON
THINGS
RADICALLY
UNLIKE
THEM
FEW
PHYSICISTS
WOULD
DISAGREE
