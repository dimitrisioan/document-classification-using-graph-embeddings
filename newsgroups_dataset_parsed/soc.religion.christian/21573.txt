anyone
who
thinks
being
gay
and
christianity
are
not
compatible
should
check
out
dignity
integrity
more
light
presbyterian
churches
affirmation
mcc
churches
etc
meet
some
gay
christians
find
out
who
they
are
pray
with
them
discuss
scripture
with
them
and
only
then
form
your
opinion
i
would
absolutly
love
to
have
the
time
and
energy
to
do
so
the
problem
is
to
be
totally
fair
i
would
have
to
go
throught
this
type
of
search
on
every
issue
i
belive
in
i
dont
have
the
time
resources
or
ability
to
do
what
you
ask
maybe
you
should
pray
that
god
gives
me
the
opportunity
instead
of
simply
discrediting
me
because
i
have
not
been
able
to
talk
to
every
gay
christian
in
christs
love
