i
also
dont
see
the
necessity
of
saying
the
holy
parents
were
some
how
sanctified
beyond
normal
humanity
it
sounds
like
our
own
inability
to
grasp
the
immensity
of
gods
grace
in
being
incarnated

thank
you
very
much
paul
i
have
always
been
impressed
by
the
very
humanness
of
mary
that
god
chose
a
woman
like
me
to
bring
into
this
world
the
incarnation
of
himself
proves
to
me
that
this
god
is
my
god
he
reaches
down
from
his
perfection
to
touch
me
ah
the
wonder
of
it
all
