RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
NOTHING
UNCLEAN
SHALL
ENTER
HEAVEN
REV
THEREFORE
BABIES
ARE
BORN
IN
SUCH
A
STATE
THAT
SHOULD
THEY
DIE
THEY
ARE
CUF
OFF
FROM
GOD
AND
PUT
IN
HELL
WHICH
IS
EXACTLY
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ST
AUGUSTINE
AND
ST
THOMAS
OF
COURES
HAVING
ONLY
ORIGINAL
SINS
ON
THIER
SOULS
THEY
SUFFER
THE
LIGHTEST
PUNISHMENT
THE
LOSS
OF
THE
VISION
OAND
PRESENCE
OF
GOD
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
THE
UNDENIABLE
FACT
THAT
THEY
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
COME
TO
A
FORGIVENSS
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
NOR
CAN
THEY
INHERIT
ETERNAL
LIFE
THAT
AS
ST
AUGUSTINE
SAID
IS
WHAT
THE
PELAGIAN
HERETICS
TAUGHT
WHICH
IS
WHY
HE
SAID
LATER
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
DO
NOT
TEACH
THAT
UNBAPTIZED
INFANTS
CAN
COME
TO
A
FORGIVENSS
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
SAY
THAT
GOD
IS
A
FAIR
GOD
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
HOW
CAN
THIS
POSSIBLY
BE
FAIR
TO
THE
INFANTS
