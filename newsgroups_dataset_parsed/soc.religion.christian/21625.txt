re
mormon
temples
from

hammerslag
how
do
you
mormons
reconcile
the
idea
of
eternal
marriage
with
christs
statement
that
in
the
resurrection
people
will
neither
marry
nor
be
given
in
marriage
luke
chapt
footnotes
in
some
bibles
reference
this
verse
to
the
book
of
tobit
tobit
is
in
the
septuagint
goodspeed
published
it
in
a
book
called
the
apocrypha
most
any
bookstore
will
have
this
at
any
rate
the
jews
of
christs
day
had
this
book
it
is
a
story
mostly
centered
around
the
son
of
tobit
who
was
named
tobias
there
was
a
young
lady
sarah
who
had
entered
the
bridal
chamber
with
seven
brothers
in
succession
the
brothers
all
died
in
the
chamber
before
consumating
the
marriage
tobias
was
entitled
to
have
sarah
for
his
wife
because
tobias
was
her
only
relative
and
she
was
destined
for
tobias
from
the
beginning
tobias
took
her
to
wife
and
was
able
to
consumate
the
marriage
the
seven
husbands
would
not
have
her
as
a
partner
in
heaven
that
does
not
eliminate
tobias
her
eighth
husband
tobit
is
a
fun
and
interesting
story
to
read
its
kind
of
a
mythical
romance
its
a
little
shorter
than
esther
the
lds
also
have
scriptures
that
parallel
and
amplify
luke
most
notably
doctrines
and
covenants
therefore
if
a
man
marry
him
a
wife
in
the
world
and
he
marry
her
not
by
me
nor
by
my
word
and
he
covenant
with
her
so
long
as
he
is
in
the
world
and
she
with
him
their
covenant
and
marriage
are
not
of
force
when
they
are
dead
and
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
therefore
they
are
not
bound
by
any
law
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
therefore
when
they
are
out
of
the
world
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
appointed
angels
in
heaven
which
angels
are
ministering
servants
to
minister
for
those
who
are
worthy
of
a
far
more
and
an
exceeding
and
an
eternal
weight
of
glory
