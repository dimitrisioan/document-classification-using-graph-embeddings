re
how
i
got
saved
my
first
and
most
important
point
is
that
regardless
of
how
your
recovery
happened
im
glad

did

i
found
it
ore
than
coincidental
that
less
than
weeks
after
i
put
my
faith
where
my
mouth
was
one
more
in
the
long
line
of
doctors
and
not
even
an
orthopeodic
specialist
diagnosed
my
problems
with
no
difficulty
set
me
on
the
path
to
an
effective
cure
and
i
was
walking
and
running
again
without
the
pain
that
had
stopped
me
from
that
for
years
the
diagnosis
was
something
he
felt
the
other
doctors
must
have
overlooked
because
it
was
perfectly
obvious
from
my
test
results
now
the
point
that
ill
try
to
make
is
that
coincidences
like
this
occur
with
a
very
high
frequency
how
many
of
us
have
been
thinking
of
someone
and
had
that
person
call
much
of
the
whole
psychic
phenomenon
is
easily
explicable
by
this
one
forgets
the
misses
consider
your
astrological
forcast
in
the
newspaper
how
many
times
have
you
said
thats
me
vs
thats
not
me
youll
remember
the
hits
but
the
misses
will
be
much
more
frequent
on
in

maybe
this
doesnt
hit
you
as
miraculous
but
to
me
it
really
is
imagine
an
active
year
old
being
told
she
may
not
be
able
to
walk
mcuh

is
now
a
happy
year
old
who
can
dance
and
run
knowing
that
the
problem
was
there
all
along
and
was
revealed
just
after
she
did
what
she
knew
was
right
as
the
song
says
and
what
if
instead
if
being
healed
your
affliction
got
much
worse
and
you
ended
up
paralyzed
would
you
have
attributed
that
to
god
as
well
or
would
that
have
been
the
work
of
satan
if
you
believe
that
would
have
been
so
why
only
good
from
god
and
only
evil
from
satan
couldnt
the
agony
have
come
from
god
think
