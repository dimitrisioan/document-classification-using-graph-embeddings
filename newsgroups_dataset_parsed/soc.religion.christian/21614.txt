MOSES
WROTE
THIS
PRAYER
AT
A
WEARY
TIME
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
ISRAEL
A
GENERATION
BEFORE
THE
TIME
OF
ITS
WRITING
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
HAD
STOOD
AT
KADESH
GATEWAY
TO
CANAAN
AND
MADE
THE
FATEFUL
CHOICE
TO
GO
THEIR
OWN
WAY
RATHER
THAN
GODS
WAY
THEY
REFUSED
AN
ADVENTURE
OF
FAITH
IN
GOD
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
GIVEN
THEM
CANAAN
THE
HOMELAND
OF
PROMISE
GOD
HONORED
THEIR
DECISION
AND
SAID
THEY
WOULD
WANDER
IN
THE
DESERT
ONLY
A
FEW
MILES
FROM
THE
LAND
OF
PROMISE
UNTIL
THEY
WERE
ALL
BURIED
IN
THE
SAND
THE
YOUNG
DECISION
MAKERS
OF
THAT
FATEFUL
DAY
WERE
BETWEEN
TWENTY
AND
THIRTY
YEARS
OLD
AND
DESTINED
TO
BE
DEAD
WITHIN
FORTY
YEARS
BLEACHED
BONES
IN
THE
DESERT
BY
THE
TIME
THEY
WERE
SEVENTY
EIGHTY
AT
THE
MOST
THE
LIVES
OF
THESE
WANDERERS
HAD
BEEN
UNENDING
SADNESS
MOSES
DESCRIBED
IT
AS
ENDING
EACH
YEAR
WITH
A
SIGH
V
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
KNEW
GIVE
OR
TAKE
A
FEW
MONTHS
WHEN
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
DIE
UNDERSCORED
THE
MEANINGLESSNESS
OF
THEIR
EXISTENCE
WHATEVER
HEIGHTS
OF
SUCCESS
THEY
REACHED
THEY
WOULD
BE
A
HEAP
OF
BLEACHED
BONES
WITHIN
FORTY
YEARS
THE
ONLY
ONES
TO
LIVE
OUTSIDE
OF
THAT
DEPRESSION
OF
HOPELESS
DISBELIEF
WERE
JOSHUA
AND
CALEB
WHO
HAD
STOOD
AGAINST
THE
NATION
AT
KADESH
AND
HAD
GOD
S
PROMISE
OF
ONE
DAY
ENTERING
THE
LAND
THE
FORTYYEAR
PERIOD
WAS
FINALLY
DRAWING
TO
AN
END
THE
NEW
GENERATION
THOSE
WHO
WERE
CHILDREN
AT
KADESH
WERE
NOW
GROWN
AND
EAGER
TO
TAKE
THE
INHERITANCE
THEIR
PARENTS
HAD
REFUSED
TO
ENJOY
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THIS
MOSES
PRAYSIT
IS
TIME
FOR
A
NEW
DAY
TO
BEGIN
AND
THE
DAYS
OF
MISERY
TO
BE
OVER
ALL
THESE
YEARS
AS
MOSES
HAD
WALKED
WITH
THESE
MOANING
AND
COMPLAINING
PEOPLE
THROUGH
THE
WILDERNESS
OF
THEIR
EXILE
HE
HAD
CARRIED
A
DOUBLE
BURDEN
HIS
WAS
NOT
ONLY
THE
SADNESS
OF
LIVING
IN
LESS
THAN
WHAT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
BUT
HE
ALSO
KNEW
WHY
THEY
HAD
CHOSEN
AS
THEY
HAD
AT
KADESH
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
THEY
WERE
IGNORANT
OF
THE
CHARACTER
OF
THEIR
GOD
IF
ASKED
WHO
IS
YOUR
GOD
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DESCRIBED
HIM
AS
THE
GOD
WHO
IS
POWER
WHEN
AARON
HAD
CREATED
THEIR
CONCEPT
OF
GOD
IN
AN
IDOL
HE
CHOSE
A
CALF
OR
YOUNG
BULLA
SYMBOL
OF
POWER
OF
VIRILITY
IN
THEIR
MINDS
GOD
WAS
THE
YOUNG
BULL
WHO
HAD
IMPALED
PHARAOH
ON
HIS
HORNS
AND
GORED
EGYPTS
GODS
AS
HE
LED
ISRAEL
TO
SINAI
BUT
WHEN
MAN
WORSHIPS
A
GOD
OF
POWER
HIS
MIRACLES
GROW
THIN
AND
EVEN
BORING
AFTER
MIRACLE
FOOD
ON
THE
DESERT
FLOOR
AND
WATER
GUSHING
MIRACULOUSLY
FROM
THE
SOLID
ROCK
THROUGH
THE
DESERT
WASTELAND
THE
GOD
OF
ALMIGHTINESS
BECOMES
HOHUM
WHAT
S
NEXT
ON
THE
MIRACLE
MENU
AND
A
GOD
OF
POWER
CAN
BE
AS
UNPREDICTABLE
AS
A
YOUNG
BULL
CALF
HE
MIGHT
BE
ALL
THEY
NEED
BUT
THENWHO
KNOWS
IF
HE
HAS
ALL
POWER
HE
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
DO
WHATEVER
HE
WANTS
WHENEVER
HE
WANTS
THE
ONLY
PERSON
THESE
PEOPLE
HAD
KNOWN
WHO
HAD
ABSOLUTE
POWER
WAS
PHARAOH
AND
MENS
LIVES
HAD
HUNG
ON
THE
WHIM
OF
HIS
MOODS
WHICH
COULD
CHANGE
WITH
THE
WIND
THEY
BELIEVED
GOD
COULD
WORK
HIS
WONDERS
ON
THEIR
BEHALF
BUT
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
HIM
AND
SO
COULD
NOT
TRUST
HIM
ISRAEL
HAD
A
GOD
BASED
ON
WHAT
HE
DID
HIS
ACTS
MOSES
KNEW
THE
HEART
OF
GOD
THE
MOTIVATION
BEHIND
THE
ACTS
FROM
THE
DAY
OF
HIS
ENCOUNTER
AT
THE
BURNING
BUSH
MOSES
HAD
BEEN
FASCINATED
BY
GOD
AT
SINAI
HE
ASKED
TO
BE
SHOWN
HIS
GLORYTO
KNOW
WHO
HE
REALLY
WAS
HE
HAD
SEEN
WHAT
GOD
HAD
DONE
HE
WANTED
TO
KNOW
WHO
GOD
WAS
THIS
REQUEST
WAS
GRANTED
AND
MOSES
WAS
GIVEN
A
GLIMPSE
OF
GODS
GLORIOUS
PERSON
HE
HAD
COME
TO
KNOW
THE
HEART
OF
GOD
AS
COMPASSION
AND
LOVINGKINDNESS
EXODUS
THE
WORD
LOVINGKINDNESS
IS
NOT
TO
BE
UNDERSTOOD
AS
A
HUMAN
KIND
OF
LOVE
IT
SPEAKS
OF
THE
KIND
OF
RELATIONSHIP
ARISING
OUT
OF
THE
MAKING
OF
A
COVENANT
IT
CAN
ONLY
BE
UNDERSTOOD
AS
THE
LOVE
THAT
SAYS
I
WILL
NEVER
LEAVE
YOU
NOR
FORSAKE
YOU
LOVINGKINDNESS
IS
AS
TENACIOUS
AS
A
BRITISH
BULLDOG
WHEN
THE
WORLD
WALKS
OUT
THIS
LOVE
DIGS
IN
ITS
HEELS
AND
REFUSES
TO
LEAVEAND
IT
IS
NOT
HUMAN
ROMANTIC
LOVE
BASED
ON
FEELINGS
AND
ROOTED
IN
EMOTIONS
IT
IS
A
LOVE
OF
COVENANT
COMMITMENT
AND
THEREFORE
OPERATES
QUITE
APART
FROM
FEELINGS
GODS
LOVE
IS
NOT
AN
EMOTION
THAT
WAVERS
DAY
BY
DAY
IT
IS
THE
TOTAL
COMMITMENT
OF
HIS
BEING
TO
SEEK
OUR
HIGHEST
AND
BEST
AND
TO
BRING
US
TO
OUR
FULLEST
POTENTIAL
AS
HUMANS
GOD
DOES
NOT
SEE
SOMETHING
GOOD
AND
BEAUTIFUL
IN
US
WHICH
AROUSES
HIS
FEELINGS
OF
LOVE
TOWARD
USWE
DO
NOT
WOO
HIM
AND
CAUSE
HIM
TO
FALL
IN
LOVE
WITH
US
IF
THAT
WERE
THE
CASE
THE
FIRST
UGLY
SINFUL
THING
WE
DID
WOULD
CAUSE
HIM
TO
REJECT
US
HE
IS
LOVE
AND
HE
LOVES
US
BECAUSE
OF
WHO
HE
IS
NOT
BECAUSE
OF
WHO
WE
ARE
HE
DOES
NOT
LOVE
WHAT
WE
DO
BUT
HE
IS
COMMITTED
TO
US
PURSUING
US
DOWN
EVERY
BLIND
ALLEY
AND
BYPATH
OF
FOOLISHNESS
HE
WILL
NOT
LET
US
GO
HIS
IS
A
LOVE
THAT
IS
NOT
LOOKING
FOR
WHAT
IT
CAN
GET
OUT
OF
US
BUT
A
COMMITTED
LOVE
THAT
SEARCHES
FOR
OPPORTUNITIES
TO
GIVE
TO
US
IT
IS
SAYING
TO
THE
RECIPIENT
FOR
AS
LONG
AS
WE
SHALL
LIVE
I
AM
FOR
YOU
THE
GOD
WHO
HAS
REVEALED
HIMSELF
TO
MAN
THROUGH
SCRIPTURE
AND
FINALLY
IN
JESUSIN
HIS
COMING
AND
IN
HIS
DEATH
AND
RESURRECTIONIS
THE
GOD
WHO
IS
LOVINGKINDNESS
THUS
HE
LOVES
US
AND
GIVES
HIMSELF
TO
USHE
WILL
NEVER
LEAVE
US
NOR
FORSAKE
US
TRAGICALLY
MANY
BELIEVERS
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
HIM
AS
LOVE
THEY
SEE
HIM
AS
POWER
NO
ONE
WILL
COME
TO
FAITH
BY
JUST
SEEING
MIRACLES
MIRACLES
POINT
TO
WHO
HE
IS
AND
THAT
IS
WHEN
FAITH
SPRINGS
IN
THE
HEART
ISRAEL
DID
NOT
SEE
GOD
AS
LOVINGKINDNESS
THEY
SAW
HIS
ACTS
OF
POWER
MOSES
KNEW
HIS
WAYS
THE
KIND
OF
GOD
HE
WAS
AND
THE
LOVE
THAT
HE
HAD
FOR
THESE
PEOPLE
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
TOTAL
LACK
OF
UNDERSTANDING
OF
HIS
LOVE
THEY
COULD
NOT
TRUST
HIM
TO
BE
THEIR
STRENGTH
IN
TAKING
THE
LAND
FAITH
IS
BORN
OUT
OF
KNOWING
THE
LOVE
HE
HAS
FOR
US
IT
IS
THE
RESTING
RESPONSE
TO
THE
ONE
WHO
GIVES
HIMSELF
TO
US
HE
IS
NOT
THE
FORCE
AND
TO
CALL
HIM
THE
ALMIGHTY
IS
TO
MISS
HIS
HEART
HE
IS
LOVE
WHO
IS
THE
ALMIGHTY
AND
THE
INFINITE
FORCE
IF
MAN
IS
TO
MAKE
FORCE
OR
RAW
POWER
WORK
FOR
HIM
HE
MUST
DEPEND
ON
KNOWING
THE
FORRNULA
AND
HAVE
FAITH
IN
IT
BUT
THE
POWER
THAT
ISSUES
FROM
LOVE
DEMANDS
FAITH
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
LOVE
HIMSELF
THE
FORTY
YEARS
OF
MEANINGLESS
WANDERING
WAS
A
MONUMENT
TO
A
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
NEVER
COME
TO
KNOW
THE
GOD
OF
LOVE
AT
THIS
POINT
WITH
THE
NEW
GENERATION
AND
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ENJOYING
ALL
THAT
GOD
PROMISED
MOSES
PRAYS
VERSE
THE
LANGUAGE
MOSES
USES
IS
REMINISCENT
OF
A
BABY
HAVING
SLEPT
SECURE
IN
ITS
MOTHERS
LOVE
NOW
WAKING
TO
LOOK
UP
INTO
THE
DELIGHT
OF
HER
EYES
IT
IS
WAKING
TO
THE
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
BEING
LOVED
WATCHED
OVER
CARED
FOR
PROTECTED
FED
AND
CLEANED
DAY
AND
NIGHT
BY
THE
MOTHER
SUPPOSE
WE
WERE
TO
ASK
WHAT
HAS
THE
BABY
DONE
TO
DESERVE
THIS
OR
HAVE
ARRANGEMENTS
BEEN
MADE
FOR
THE
CHILD
TO
REPAY
THE
PARENTS
FOR
THIS
INCONVENIENCE
OUR
QUESTIONS
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
UNNATURAL
EVEN
IMMORAL
THE
CHILD
WAS
CONCEIVED
IN
LOVE
ANTICIPATED
AND
PREPARED
FOR
WITH
LOVES
EXCITEMENT
A
LOVE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
TO
THE
GATES
OF
DEATH
TO
BRING
IT
INTO
BEING
THE
PARENTS
LOVE
IS
UNCONDITIONAL
SPONTANEOUSIT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
LOOKS
OF
THE
CHILD
OR
ITS
PERFORMANCE
SO
GOD
IS
LOVE
HE
LOVES
US
UNCONDITIONALLY
SPONTANEOUSLY
WE
WERE
CONCEIVED
IN
HIS
IMAGINATION
AND
FASHIONED
AFTER
HIS
IMAGE
TO
BE
BROUGHT
TO
WHERE
WE
ARE
AT
THIS
MOMENT
BY
THE
BLOOD
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
IT
IS
SLANDEROUS
AND
IMMORAL
TO
EVEN
ASK
WHAT
WE
MUST
DO
TO
EARN
AND
DESERVE
THAT
LOVE
THE
CHILD
DISCOVERS
ITS
PERSONHOOD
AND
IDENTITY
THROUGH
THE
EYES
AND
TOUCH
THROUGH
THE
CUDDLES
OF
ITS
PARENTS
LOVE
IT
IS
A
SCIENTIFIC
FACT
THAT
A
BABY
WHO
IS
NOT
TOUCHED
AND
HELD
WILL
PROBABLY
DIE
OR
IF
IT
SURVIVES
WILL
HAVE
SEVERE
EMOTIONAL
PROBLEMS
AND
A
PERSON
WHO
HAS
BEEN
HELD
AND
LOVED
WILL
STILL
NEVER
KNOW
THE
TRUE
MEANING
OF
LIFE
WITHOUT
THE
EMBRACE
AND
KNOWLEDGE
OF
LOVE
FROM
GOD
MOSES
PRAYS
THAT
THE
NEW
GENERATION
WILL
LEARN
TO
WAKE
EVERY
MORNING
RESTING
WITH
TOTAL
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
AND
WILL
RECEIVE
ALL
HIS
PROMISES
AND
BLESSINGS
WITH
JOY
AND
GLADNESS
SIGNIFICANTLY
MOSES
PRAYS
THAT
THEY
WILL
BE
SATISFIED
WITH
HIS
LOVE
SATISFIED
IN
THE
HEBREW
LANGUAGE
IS
A
RICH
PICTURE
WORD
DESCRIBING
BEING
FILLED
WITH
AN
ABUNDANCE
OF
GOURMET
FOOD
IT
IS
ALSO
USED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
EARTH
AFTER
THE
RAIN
HAS
SOAKED
IT
AND
ALL
THE
VEGETATION
HAS
RECEIVED
ENOUGH
WATER
MOSES
PRAYS
THAT
THEY
WILL
AWAKEN
EVERY
MORNING
TO
BE
DRENCHED
IN
THE
LIFEGIVING
LOVE
OF
GOD
THAT
SENSE
OF
SATISFACTION
IS
THE
LIFELONG
QUEST
OF
EVERY
MAN
AND
WOMAN
WHEN
WE
ARE
SATISFIED
IN
OUR
DEEPEST
SELVES
MANY
OF
OUR
EMOTIONALAND
EVEN
OUR
PHYSICALPROBLEMS
DISAPPEAR
MAN
SEEKS
THAT
SENSE
OF
SATISFACTION
WHICH
COMES
FROM
FEELING
THAT
HE
IS
FULFILLED
AS
A
HUMAN
BEINGHIS
HOURS
HAVE
MEANING
WHICH
MAKE
SENSE
OUT
OF
THE
ORDINARY
AND
MUNDANE
APART
FROM
GOD
MAN
SEEKS
THIS
SATISFACTION
THROUGH
INTELLECTUAL
PURSUIT
THROUGH
THE
EXCITING
OF
THE
EMOTIONS
AND
THROUGH
THE
FEEDING
OF
HIS
BODYHE
WILL
EVEN
SEEK
IT
IN
RELIGIOUS
EXERCISE
BUT
MAN
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
DISSATISFIED
UNTIL
HE
IS
RESPONDING
TO
THE
LOVE
OF
THE
LIVING
GOD
ONLY
IN
KNOWING
GODS
LOVE
WILL
THE
REST
OF
LIFE
MAKE
SENSE
AS
THE
FORTY
YEARS
DREW
TO
A
CLOSE
AND
THE
LAND
OF
PROMISE
AGAIN
BECAME
THE
INHERITANCE
TO
BE
TAKEN
MOSES
PRAYED
THIS
PSALM
I
FIND
IT
FASCINATING
THAT
HE
SHOULD
PRAY
AND
ASK
GOD
FOR
A
DAILY
REVELATION
OF
HIS
LOVE
CONSIDERING
THE
AWE
WITH
WHICH
THE
PEOPLE
HELD
MOSES
ONE
WOULD
THINK
HE
COULD
HAVE
LECTURED
THEM
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
LOVINGKINDNESS
AND
BY
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THEY
GAINED
THEY
WOULD
LIVE
IN
IT
BUT
MOSES
KNEW
BETTER
GOD
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
CAN
MAKE
KNOWN
TO
US
HIS
LOVE
WE
WONT
FIND
IT
IN
A
RELIGIOUS
LECTURE
OR
A
FORMULA
WHICH
WE
CAN
LEARN
AND
USE
TO
MANIPULATE
HIM
NOR
IS
IT
IN
A
BEAUTIFUL
POEM
TO
TITILLATE
OUR
EMOTIONS
AND
GIVE
US
GOD
FEELINGS
IT
IS
GOD
HIMSELF
THE
LOVER
WHO
MUST
OPEN
OUR
EYES
AND
SATISFY
US
WITH
HIS
LOVE
THIS
PRAYER
IS
MAN
IN
HELPLESSNESS
ASKING
GOD
TO
MAKE
THE
LOVE
HE
IS
REAL
IN
OUR
HEARTS
MOSES
PRAYER
WAS
PARTIALLY
ANSWERED
IN
THE
NEXT
GENERATION
AND
SEEN
IN
THE
EXPLOITS
OF
FAITH
WHICH
WORKED
BY
LOVE
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
JUDGES
BUT
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
ANSWERED
IN
ITS
FULLEST
DIMENSIONS
UNTIL
THE
COMING
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
WHO
POURS
OUT
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
IN
OUR
HEARTS
ROMANS
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
WE
READ
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
FALLING
UPON
THE
BELIEVERS
THIS
IS
AN
ANCIENT
EXPRESSION
THAT
IN
MODERN
ENGLISH
MEANS
TO
GIVE
A
BEAR
HUG
IT
IS
USED
IN
LUKE
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
FATHER
RUNNING
TO
THE
PRODIGAL
AND
FALLING
ON
HIS
NECK
AND
KISSING
HIM
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IS
GOD
HUGGING
YOU
IN
YOUR
DEEPEST
SELF
AND
SMOTHERING
YOU
WITH
DIVINE
KISSES
AT
THE
DEEPEST
LEVEL
OF
YOUR
BEING
THIS
IS
NOT
A
ONETIME
EXPERIENCE
TO
BE
FILED
IN
OUR
SPIRITUAL
RESUMES
MOSES
PRAYED
THAT
MORNING
BY
MORNING
WE
WOULD
AWAKEN
TO
THE
REALIZATION
THAT
WE
ARE
LOVED
THE
WORLD
AND
MUCH
OF
OUR
RELIGIOUS
TRAINING
HAS
TAUGHT
US
TO
PERFORM
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
ACCEPTED
WE
HAVE
SPENT
FAR
TOO
LONG
LIVING
IN
A
STATE
OF
DOING
IN
ORDER
TO
FIND
SATISFACTION
FOR
OURSELVESTO
FIND
ACCEPTANCE
AND
LOVE
FROM
OTHERS
AND
FROM
GOD
WE
NOW
COME
HUMBLED
TO
RECEIVE
LOVE
WE
CANNOT
EARNTO
BE
STILL
AND
LET
HIM
TELL
US
WE
ARE
LOVED
TO
LET
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
DESCEND
INTO
US
POURING
OUT
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
WE
COME
IN
STILLNESS
TO
THINK
ON
AND
REPEAT
HIS
WORDS
OF
LOVE
TO
OUR
MINDS
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
JADED
WITH
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
PERFORM
TO
BE
ACCEPTED
WE
BEGIN
TO
REALIZE
THAT
HE
LOVES
US
AS
WE
ARE
AND
GIVES
MEANING
AND
PURPOSE
TO
ALL
OF
LIFE
I
CHALLENGE
EVERYONE
READING
THIS
TO
BEGIN
EACH
DAY
FROM
THE
MOMENT
YOU
OPEN
YOUR
EYES
BY
CELEBRATING
THE
GOD
OF
LOVE
AND
PRAYING
THIS
PRAYER
YOU
MAY
NOT
FEEL
ANYTHING
BUT
SOMETHING
ALWAYS
HAPPENS
I
WAS
XRAYED
THE
OTHER
DAY
I
DID
NOT
SEE
OR
FEEL
ANYTHING
BUT
I
NOTED
THAT
THE
TECHNICIANS
KEPT
BEHIND
PROTECTIVE
WALLS
THEY
KNOW
YOU
CANNOT
BE
EXPOSED
TO
THOSE
RAYS
WITHOUT
BEING
AFFECTED
SO
IT
IS
AS
WE
CONSCIOUSLY
BEGIN
OUR
DAY
KNOWING
THAT
WE
ARE
LOVED
SUCH
EXPERIENTIAL
KNOWLEDGE
WILL
PRODUCE
ACCORDING
TO
MOSES
JOY
AND
GLADNESS
ALL
OUR
DAYS
JOY
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
A
LIFE
THAT
IS
FUNCTIONING
AS
GOD
INTENDED
US
TO
FUNCTION
WHEN
HE
MADE
US
YOU
MIGHT
SAY
THAT
JOY
IS
THE
HUM
OF
AN
ENGINE
THAT
IS
AT
PEAK
PERFORMANCE
MAN
S
HIGHEST
PERFORMANCE
IS
TO
REST
IN
THE
LOVE
GOD
HAS
FOR
HIM
THE
HUM
WILL
BE
JOY
AND
THE
RESULT
WILL
BE
ENDLESS
CREATIVITY
ARISING
FROM
THE
SENSE
OF
MEANING
HE
NOW
HAS
IN
LIFE
STOP
WANDERING
IN
THE
WILDERNESS
BE
SATISFIED
WITH
HIS
LOVE
AND
IN
JOY
DAY
BY
DAY
RECEIVE
ALL
HIS
PROMISED
BLESSINGS
