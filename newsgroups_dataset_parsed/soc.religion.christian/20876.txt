PASTORAL
AUTHORITY
THERE
IS
SOME
CONTROVERSY
IN
MY
DENOMINATION
AS
TO
WHAT
AUTHORITY
IS
VESTED
IN
THE
PASTOR
I
AM
STILL
FORMING
MY
OPINION
I
AM
SOLICING
OPINIONS
AND
REFERENCES
FOR
WHAT
THAT
IS
HOW
MUCH
AND
HOW
IT
SHOULD
BE
USED
AS
A
GENERAL
REFERENCE
I
WOULD
NOT
EXCLUDE
RESPONSES
FROM
DIFFERENT
DENOMINATIONS
BASED
ON
BIBLICAL
TEACHINGS
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
UNDERSTAND
OUR
CHURCH
IS
INDEPENDENT
PROTESTANT
AND
LIKELY
TO
BE
MUCH
DIFFERENT
FROM
THOSE
THAT
FOLLOW
ECCLESIASTICAL
AUTHORITY
IN
THE
CHURCH
WE
MAY
NEED
TO
DISCUSS
THE
ROLES
OF
DEACONS
AND
ELDERS
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
REPLIES
ANSWER
NOT
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
THOU
ALSO
BE
LIKE
UNTO
HIM
ANSWER
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
HE
BE
WISE
IN
HIS
OWN
CONCEIT
PROVERBS
