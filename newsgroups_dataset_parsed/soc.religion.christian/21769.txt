RE
PORTLAND
EARTHQUAKE
BILL
REA
WROTE
HIS
THEOLOGY
CLASHED
WITH
THE
THEOLOGY
OF
THE
LOCAL
PROPHETS
IT
WAS
OUT
OF
A
VERY
DEEP
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
MOSAIC
COVENANT
AND
AN
ACTUTE
AWARENESS
OF
INTERNATIONAL
EVENTS
THAT
JEREMIAH
SPOKE
HIS
PROPHESIES
THE
JUDGEMENT
PROPHESIES
WERE
DEEPLY
LOADED
WITH
THEOLOGICAL
MEANING
IN
MY
OPINION
BOTH
THE
PORTLAND
EARTHQUAKE
PROPHESY
AND
THE
DAVID
WILKERSON
NEW
YORK
WILL
BURN
PROPHESY
ARE
FROTH
AND
BUBBLE
COMPARED
TO
THE
MAJESTIC
THEOLOGICAL
DEPTHS
OF
THE
JEREMIAH
PROPHESIES
PERHAPS
ONE
OTHER
THING
I
SHOULD
HAVE
ADDED
IS
THAT
JEREMIAHS
PROPHESIES
ABOUT
THE
COMING
DESTRUCTION
OF
JERUSALEM
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
UNDERSTOOD
BY
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THAT
TIME
TO
BE
A
FULL
FRONTAL
ASSAULT
ON
THEIR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE
LORD
TODAY
THE
IF
THE
GENERAL
POPULACE
HEARS
PROPHESIES
LIKE
THE
PORTLAND
EARTHQUAKE
OR
NEW
YORK
WILL
BURN
ONES
THEY
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
SEE
IT
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
OR
LACK
OF
IT
WITH
THE
LORD
THEY
ARE
FAR
MORE
LIKELY
TO
THINK
THAT
THEY
ARE
JUST
THE
RESULT
OF
THE
FEVERED
IMAGINATIONS
OF
A
RELIGIOUS
NUTTER
THAT
IS
ONE
REASON
WHY
I
AM
ALWAYS
DEEPY
SUSPICIOUS
OF
BALD
JUDGEMENT
PROPHESIES
WITHOUT
ANY
EXPLANATION
OF
THE
REASONS
FOR
THE
JUDGEMENT
THIS
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
BE
LONG
WINDED
TO
SEE
A
RELATIVELY
MODERN
EXAMPLE
LOOK
AT
ABRAHAM
LINCOLNS
SECOND
INAUGURAL
SPEECH
THE
RELEVANT
SECTION
IS
BELOW
IT
IS
THIS
TYPE
OF
SPIRITUAL
INSIGHT
WHICH
WAS
MISSING
IN
BOTH
PROPHESIES
POSTED
HERE
EXCERPT
FROM
ABRAHAM
LINCOLNS
INAUGURAL
SPEECH
BOTH
READ
THE
SAME
BIBLE
AND
PRAY
TO
THE
SAME
GOD
AND
EACH
INVOKES
HIS
AID
AGAINST
THE
OTHER
IT
MAY
SEEM
STRANGE
THAT
ANY
MEN
SHOULD
DARE
TO
ASK
A
JUST
GODS
ASSISTANCE
IN
WRINGING
THEIR
BREAD
FROM
THE
SWEAT
OF
OTHER
MENS
FACES
BUT
LET
US
JUDGE
NOT
THAT
WE
BE
NOT
JUDGED
THE
PRAYERS
OF
BOTH
COULD
NOT
HE
ANSWERED
THAT
OF
NEITHER
HAS
BEEN
ANSWERED
FULLY
THE
ALMIGHTY
HAS
HIS
OWN
PURPOSES
WOE
UNTO
THE
WORLD
BECAUSE
OF
OFFENCES
FOR
IT
MUST
NEEDS
BE
THAT
OFFENCES
COME
BUT
WOE
TO
THAT
MAN
BY
WHOM
THE
OFFENCE
COMETH
IF
WE
SHALL
SUPPOSE
THAT
AMERICAN
SLAVERY
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
OFFENCES
WHICH
IN
THE
PROVDENCE
OF
GOD
MUST
NEEDS
COME
BUT
WHICH
HAVING
CONTINUED
THROUGH
HIS
APPOINTED
TIME
HE
NOW
WILLS
TO
REMOVE
AND
THAT
HE
GIVES
TO
BOTH
NORTH
AND
SOUTH
THIS
TERRIBLE
WAR
AS
THE
WOE
DUE
TO
THOSE
BY
WHOM
THE
OFFENCE
CAME
SHALL
WE
DISCERN
THEREIN
AN
DEPARTURE
FROM
THOSE
DIVINE
ATTRIBUTE
WHICH
THE
BELIEVERS
IN
A
LIVING
GOD
ALWAYS
ASCRIBE
TO
HIM
FONDLY
DO
WE
HOPE
FERVENTLY
DO
WE
PRAY
THAT
THIS
MIGHTY
SCOURGE
OF
WAR
MAY
SPEEDILY
PASS
AWAY
YET
IF
GOD
WILLS
THAT
IT
CONTINUE
UNTIL
ALL
THE
WEALTH
PILED
BY
THE
BONDMANS
TWO
HUNDRED
AND
FIFTY
YEARS
OF
UNREQUITED
TOIL
SHALL
BE
SUNK
AND
UNTIL
EVERY
DROP
OF
BLOOD
DRAWN
WITH
THE
LASH
SHALL
BE
PAID
BY
ANOTHER
DRAWN
WITH
THE
SWORD
AS
WAS
SAID
THREE
THOUSAND
YEARS
AGO
SO
STILL
IT
MUST
BE
SAID
THE
JUDGMENTS
OF
THE
LORD
ARE
TRUE
AND
RIGHTEOUS
ALTOGETHER
WITH
MALICE
TOWARD
NONE
WITH
CHARITY
FOR
ALL
WITH
FIRMNESS
IN
THE
RIGHT
AS
GOD
GIVES
US
TO
SEE
THE
RIGHT
LET
US
STRIVE
ON
TO
FINISH
THE
WORK
WE
ARE
IN
TO
BIND
UP
THE
NATIONS
WOUNDS
TO
CARE
FOR
HIM
WHO
SHALL
HAVE
BORNE
THE
BATTLE
AND
FOR
HIS
WIDOW
AND
HIS
ORPHAN
TO
DO
ALL
WHICH
MAY
ACHIEVE
AND
CHERISH
A
JUST
AND
A
LASTING
PEACE

OURSELVES
