MONOPHYSITES

IF
YOU
ARE
USING
THE
STANDARD
FORMULA
OF
FULLY
GOD
AND
FULLY
HUMAN
THAT
IM
NOT
SURE
WHY
YOU
OBJECT
TO
SAYING
THAT
JESUS
WAS
HUMAN
I
THINK
THE
USUAL
ANALYSIS
WOULD
BE
THAT
SIN
IS
NOT
PART
OF
THE
BASIC
DEFINITION
OF
HUMANITY
ITS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THE
FALL
JESUS
IS
HUMAN
BUT
NOT
A
FALLEN
HUMAN
CLH
THE
PROPER
TERM
FOR
WHAT
MIKE
EXPRESSES
IS
MONOPHYSITISM
THIS
WAS
A
HERESY
THAT
WAS
CONDEMNED
IN
THE
COUNCIL
OF
CHALCEDON
IN
AD
IT
GREW
UP
IN
REACTION
TO
NESTORIANISM
WHICH
HELD
THAT
THE
SON
AND
JESUS
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
BE
UNITED
IN
THE
SAME
BODY
TEMPORARILY
MONOPHYSITISM
IS
HELD
BY
THE
COPTS
OF
EGYPT
AND
ETHIPOIA
AND
BY
THE
JACOBITES
OF
SYRIA
AND
THE
ARMENIAN
ORTHODOX
IT
BELIEVES
THAT
JESUS
CHRIST
WAS
GOD
WHICH
IS
CORRECT
THAT
HE
WAS
MAN
WHICH
IS
CORRECT
THAT
HE
WAS
ONE
PERSON
WHICH
IS
CORRECT
BUT
THAT
HE
HAD
ONLY
ONE
NATURE
AND
ONE
WILL
AND
OEN
ENERGY
WHICH
IS
HERETICAL
THE
ORTHODOX
POSITION
IS
THAT
HE
HAD
TWO
NATURES
AND
TWO
WILLS
AND
TWO
ENERGIES
BOTH
DIVINE
AND
HUMAN
THOUGH
THE
WILLS
WERE
IN
PERFECT
HARMONY
THAT
IS
WHAT
MIKE
IS
TRYING
TO
GET
ACROSS
THAT
WHILE
JESUS
CAME
IN
HUMAN
FORM
MIKE
SAYS
HE
DID
NOT
HAVE
A
HUMAN
NATURE
OR
A
HUMAN
WILL
IN
REALITY
HE
HAD
BOTH
THOUGH
NEITHER
MADE
HIM
SUBJECT
TO
ORIGINAL
SIN
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
MONOTHELITES
WERE
A
REACTION
TO
THIS
CONFLICT
AND
ATTEMPTED
TO
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
BY
ADMITTING
TWO
NATURES
BUT
NOT
TWO
WILLS
OR
TWO
ENERGIES
IT
ALSO
WAS
CONDEMNED
AT
A
LATE
COUNCIL
IN
CONSTANTINOPLE
I
BELIEVE
ANDY
BYLER
THESE
ISSUES
GET
MIGHTY
SUBTLE
WHEN
YOU
SEE
PEOPLE
SAYING
DIFFERENT
THINGS
ITS
OFTEN
HARD
TO
TELL
WHETHER
THEY
REALLY
MEAN
SERIOUSLY
DIFFERENT
THINGS
OR
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
USING
DIFFERENT
TERMINOLOGY
I
DONT
THINK
THERES
ANY
QUESTION
THAT
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
NESTORIUS
AND
I
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
THE
SAYING
CHRIST
HAD
A
HUMAN
FORM
WITHOUT
A
REAL
HUMAN
NATURE
OR
WILL
IS
HERETICAL
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
A
BIT
WARY
ABOUT
THE
COPTS
ARMENIANS
ETC
RECENT
DISCUSSIONS
SUGGEST
THAT
THEIR
MONOPHYSITE
POSITION
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
FAR
FROM
ORTHODOXY
AS
MANY
HAD
THOUGHT
NESTORIUS
WAS
AN
EXTREME
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
MAJOR
SCHOOLS
OF
THOUGHT
MORE
MODERATE
REPRESENTATIVES
WERE
REGARDED
AS
ORTHODOX
EG
THEODORE
OF
MOPSUESTIA
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
THE
MODERN
MONOPHYSITE
GROUPS
INHERIT
THE
ENTIRE
TRADITION
NOT
JUST
NESTORIUS
VERSION
AND
THAT
SOME
OF
THEM
MAY
HAVE
A
SUFFICIENT
BALANCED
POSITION
TO
BE
REGARDED
AS
ORTHODOX
CLH
