RE
NATIONAL
REPENTANCE
MICHAEL
COVINGTON
WRITES
I
HEARD
ON
THE
RADIO
TODAY
ABOUT
A
CHRISTIAN
STUDENT
CONFERENCE
WHERE
CHRISTIANS
WERE
CALLED
TO
REPENT
OF
AMERICAS
NATIONAL
SINS
SUCH
AS
SEXUAL
PROMISCUITY
TO
WHICH
I
REPLY
WHOA
THERE
HOW
CAN
I
REPENT
OF
SOMEONE
ELSES
SIN
I
CANT
AND
WHEN
I
CLAIM
TO
REPENT
OF
SOMEONE
ELSES
SIN
AM
I
NOT
IN
FACT
JUDGING
HIM
JESUS
EQUIPPED
US
TO
JUDGE
ACTIVITIES
BUT
WARNED
US
NOT
TO
JUDGE
PEOPLE
JUDGE
NOT
THAT
YE
BE
NOT
JUDGED
C
S
LEWIS
MADE
THE
SAME
POINT
IN
AN
ESSAY
AFTER
WORLD
WAR
II
WHEN
SOME
CHRISTIAN
LEADERS
IN
BRITAIN
WERE
URGING
NATIONAL
REPENTANCE
FOR
THE
HORRORS
SINS
OF
WORLD
WAR
II
I
SEE
YOUR
POINT
BUT
I
CANNOT
MORE
STRONGLY
DISAGREE
TO
REPENT
MEANS
TO
TURN
AROUND
WE
AS
A
NATION
HAVE
BEHAVED
INCREDIBLY
ARROGANTLY
TOWARD
GOD
CONDONING
ENCOURAGING
AND
EVEN
FORCING
FOLKS
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
ACTIVITY
DIRECTLY
OPPOSED
TO
THE
WRITTEN
WORD
OF
GOD
WE
HAVE
ARROGANTLY
SET
OUR
NATION
FAR
ABOVE
THE
GOD
WHO
CREATED
IT
AND
ALLOWED
US
THE
LUXURY
OF
LIVING
IN
THIS
LAND
WE
HAVE
SET
A
BAD
EXAMPLE
FOR
OTHER
NATIONS
WEVE
SLAUGHTERED
UNBORN
CHILDREN
BY
THE
MILLIONS
WE
HAVE
STRICKEN
THE
NAME
OF
GOD
FROM
THE
CLASSROOM
WEVE
CHEATED
GOD
OUT
OF
THE
HONOR
DUE
HIM
AT
EVERY
TURN
AND
WE
OWE
GOD
AN
APOLOGY
EVERY
BIT
AS
PUBLIC
AS
OUR
SINS
HAVE
BEEN
WHEN
JESUS
SAID
JUDGE
NOT
THAT
YE
BE
NOT
JUDGED
HE
WAS
NOT
ADDRESSING
THOSE
LIKE
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
WHO
HAD
REPENTED
AND
WERE
CALLING
OTHERS
TO
REPENT
HE
WAS
ADDRESSING
THOSE
WHO
REMAINED
IN
SIN
WHILE
HEAPING
DOWN
CONDEMNATION
ON
OTHERS
FOR
THEIR
SINS
HIS
MESSAGE
TO
US
ALL
WAS
TO
REMOVE
THE
LOG
FROM
OUR
OWN
EYE
BEFORE
REMOVING
THE
SPECK
FROM
OUR
BROTHERS
BUT
HE
ALSO
SAID
TO
REBUKE
AND
TO
REPROVE
DONT
FORGET
THAT
THIS
IS
A
COMMAND
TOO
OUR
PROBLEM
TODAY
IS
THAT
WE
TEND
TO
JUDGE
AND
CONDEMN
AS
THOUGH
WE
WERE
REBUKING
AND
WE
TEND
TO
NEGLECT
BRINGING
FOLKS
BACK
TO
THE
LORD
WITH
THE
EXCUSE
THAT
WE
DONT
WANT
TO
JUDGE
ANYONE
IN
TRUTH
WHAT
WE
NEED
TO
DO
IS
TO
JUDGE
LESS
AND
CALL
OTHERS
TO
REPENT
MORE
AND
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
IN
OUR
OWN
MOTIVES
CALL
SIN
WHAT
IT
IS
AND
DO
SO
OPENLY
LET
ITS
CHARGE
FALL
CORRECTLY
WHERE
IT
SHOULD
BUT
INSTEAD
OF
RUNNING
SOMEONE
INTO
HELL
OVER
IT
PULL
THEM
OUT
OF
THEIR
HELLWARD
PATH
AND
ONTO
THE
HEAVENWARD
PATH
I
DEPLORE
THE
HORRIBLE
CRIME
OF
CHILD
MURDER
WE
WANT
PREVENTION
NOT
MERELY
PUNISHMENT
WE
MUST
REACH
THE
ROOT
OF
THE
EVIL
IT
IS
PRACTICED
BY
THOSE
WHOSE
INMOST
SOULS
REVOLT
FROM
THE
DREADFUL
DEED
NO
MATER
WHAT
THE
MOTIVE
LOVE
OF
EASE
OR
A
DESIRE
TO
SAVE
FROM
SUFFERING
THE
UNBORN
INNOCENT
THE
WOMAN
IS
AWFULLY
GUILTY
WHO
COMMITS
THE
DEED
BUT
OH
THRICE
GUILTY
IS
HE
WHO
DROVE
HER
TO
THE
DESPERATION
WHICH
IMPELLED
HER
TO
THE
CRIME
