WRITES
THIS
PARAGRAPH
BROUGHT
TO
MIND
A
QUESTION
HOW
DO
YOU
MORMONS
RECONCILE
THE
IDEA
OF
ETERNAL
MARRIAGE
WITH
CHRISTS
STATEMENT
THAT
IN
THE
RESSURECTION
PEOPLE
WILL
NEITHER
MARRY
NOR
BE
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE
LUKE
CHAPT
DELETIONS
I
THINK
WHAT
JESUS
IS
SAYING
HERE
AND
IT
IS
CLEAREST
IN
MATTHEWS
AND
MARKS
ACCOUNTS
IS
THAT
MARRIAGES
WILL
NOT
BE
PERFORMED
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
THIS
GOES
ALONG
WITH
OUR
BELIEF
THAT
IF
A
PERSON
IS
TO
MARRY
AT
ALL
IT
MUST
BE
DONE
ON
THIS
EARTH
DELETIONS
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
VIEW
IS
THAT
THE
TOPIC
UNDER
DISCUSSION
IN
THIS
PASSAGE
IS
MARRIAGES
THAT
WERE
PERFORMED
ON
EARTH
JESUS
WORDS
SEEM
TO
ME
TO
INDICATE
THAT
HE
REGARDS
HIS
RESPONSE
AS
THE
ANSWER
TO
THEIR
QUESTION
ABOUT
WHICH
EARTHLY
MARRIAGE
WOULD
BE
VALID
AFTER
THE
RESURRECTION
THIS
BEING
THE
CASE
THE
MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD
INTERPRETATION
IN
MY
OPINION
IS
THAT
MARRIAGE
DOES
NOT
EXIST
IN
THE
NEXT
LIFE
BECAUSE
THOSE
WHO
ARE
RAISED
ARE
OF
A
DIFFERENT
NATURE
THAN
WHAT
WE
ARE
NOW
OTHER
WISE
WHY
WOULD
JESUS
OFFER
BUT
ARE
LIKE
THE
ANGELS
IN
HEAVEN
AS
A
CONTRAST
TO
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
RESURRECTED
MARRYING
AND
BEING
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANGELLIKE
NATURES
NOW
BUT
SOMEDAY
WE
SHALL
AND
WHEN
WE
DO
OUR
EARTHLY
MARRIAGES
WILL
BE
IRRELEVANT
OR
AT
LEAST
THATS
WHAT
I
THINK
JESUS
IS
SAYING
ABOUT
THE
POSTRESURRECTION
VALIDITY
OF
MARRIAGES
PERFORMED
ON
EARTH
YOUR
MILEAGE
MAY
VARY
MARK
