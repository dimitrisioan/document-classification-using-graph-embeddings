A
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
BEE
BOTHERING
ME
MALCUSCO
WRITES
ESPECIALLY
AS
WE
APPROACH
A
TIME
WHEN
SCIENTISTS
ARE
TRYING
TO
MATCH
GODS
ABILITY
TO
CREATE
LIFE
WE
SHOULD
USE
THE
UTMOST
CAUTION
I
QUESTION
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THIS
STATEMENT
NAMELY
THAT
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
PHYSICAL
ACTS
WHICH
ARE
LIMITED
TO
GOD
AND
THAT
ATTEMPTING
TO
REPLICATE
THESE
ACTS
IS
BLASPHEMY
AGAINST
GOD
GOD
CAUSED
A
BUSH

CONSUMEDIF
I
DO
THE

THING
AM
I
USURPING
GODS
ROLE
RELIGIOUS
PEOPLE
ARE
THREATENED
BY
SCIENCE
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
BEEN
SYSTEMATICALLY
REMOVING
THE
PHYSICAL
PROOFS
OF
GODS
EXISTENCE
AS
TIME
GOES
ON
WE
HAVE
TO
RELY
MORE
AND
MORE
ON
FAITH
AND
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
TO
RELATE
TO
GOD
BECUASE
SCIENCE
IS
REMOVING
OUR
PROPS
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
A
BAD
