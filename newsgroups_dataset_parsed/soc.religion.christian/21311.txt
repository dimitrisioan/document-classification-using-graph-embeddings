MATTHEW
HUNTBACH
WRITES
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
CLAIMS
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
AUTHENTICATED
CASES
OF
PEOPLE
MAKING
PROLONGED
SPEECHES
IN
REAL
LANGUAGES
THEY
DONT
KNOW
FROM
MY
OBSERVATIONS
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
IN
PRACTICE
HAS
NOTHING
AT
ALL
DO
WITH
THIS
I
HAVE
A
SIMPLE
TEST
I
TAKE
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
SPEAK
ONLY
ONE
LANGUAGE
EG
CHINESE
RUSSIAN
GERMAN
ENGLISH
THEN
I
LET
THE
GIFTED
ONE
START
SPEAKING
IN
TOUNGUES
THE
AUDIENCE
SHOULD
UNDERSTAND
THE
GIFTED
ONE
CLEARLY
IN
THEIR
NATIVE
LANGUAGE
HOWEVER
THE
GIFTED
ONE
CAN
ONLY
HEAR
HIMSELF
SPEAKING
IN
HIS
OWN
LANGUAGE
WORKS
EVERYTIME
PERHAPS
I
WOULD
BELIEVE
THE
GIFTED
ONES
MORE
IF
THEY
WERE
GLORIFYING
GOD
RATHER
THAN
THEMSELVES
THEN
PERHAPS
WED
WITNESS
A
REAL
MIRACLE
MARK
ASHLEY
DISCLAIMER
MY
OPINIONS
NOT
