WHEN
ARE
TWO
PEOPLE
MARRIED

ASHLEY
WRITES
THOSE
WITH
BIBLES
ON
HAND
CAN
GIVE
THE
EXACT
CHAPTER
VERSE
AT
THE
TIME
JESUS
TOLD
PETER
THAT
HE
WAS
THE
ROCK
HE
SAID
WHATEVER
YOU
HOLD
TRUE
ON
EARTH
IS
HELD
TRUE
IN
HEAVEN
AND
WHATEVER
YOU
DONT
HOLD
TRUE
WONT
BE
TRUE
IN
HEAVEN
THEREFORE
WITH
RESPECT
TO
MARRIAGE
THE
CEREMONY
HAS
TO
BE
DONE
BY
AN
RC
PRIEST
NO
BIG
PARTIES
REQUIRED
JUST
THE
PRIEST
THE
COUPLE
AND
WITNESSES
DIVORCE
IS
NOT
ALLOWED
BUT
ANULLMENTS
ARE
GRANTED
UPON
APPROVAL
BY
EITHER
THE
BISHOP
OR
THE
POPE
NOT
SURE
IF
THE
POPE
DELEGATES
THIS
FUNCTION
MAYBE
IM
A
LITTLE
TIRED
BUT
I
CANT
SEEM
TO
FOLLOW
THE
LOGIC
HERE
IF
WHATEVER
IS
HELD
TRUE
ON
EARTH
IS
HELD
TRUE
IN
HEAVEN
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
A
PRIEST
RC
ONLY
APPARENTLY
IS
REQUIRED
IN
FACT
IF
I
READ
THE
NEXT
VERSE
CORRECTLY
MATTHEW
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
FOR
A
MARRIAGE
TO
TAKE
PLACE
ONLY
TWO
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
AGREE
ON
EARTH
TOUCHING
ONE
THING
AND
IT
SHALL
BE
DONE

DISCLAIMER

OPINIONS
NOT

THE
LOST
LOS
ANGELINO
UNFORTUNATELY
I
HAVENT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
FIND
ANY
COMPLETELY
PRECISE
STATEMENTS
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
NEEDED
AS
USUAL
THE
CURRENT
EDITION
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
ENCYCLOPEDIA
IS
FRUSTRATINGLY
VAGUE
I
DO
KNOW
THAT
THE
PRIEST
IS
VIEWED
AS
A
WITNESS
AND
THUS
IN
SOME
SENSE
WOULD
NOT
BE
REQUIRED
HOWEVER
PART
OF
THE
PURPOSE
OF
FORMAL
MARRIAGE
IS
TO
AVOID
ANY
AMBIGUITY
ABOUT
WHO
HAS
AND
HAS
NOT
TAKEN
ON
THE
COMMITMENT
THE
COMMUNITY
PROVIDES
SUPPORT
TO
MARRIAGE
AND
IN
CASES
OF
PROBLEMS
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
HELPING
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
CARRY
OUT
AS
MUCH
OF
THEIR
COMMITMENT
AS
POSSIBLE
THUS
MARRIAGE
MUST
BE
A
PUBLIC
COMMITMENT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
PRIEST
IS
REQUIRED
FOR
A
REGULAR
MARRIAGE
WHERE
IM
NOT
CLEAR
IS
EXACTLY
WHERE
THE
BOUNDARIES
ARE
IN
EXCEPTIONAL
CASES
VALID
BUT
IRREGULAR
NE
TEMERE
SAYS
THAT
NO
MARRIAGE
INVOLVING
A
CATHOLIC
IS
VALID
WITHOUT
A
PRIEST
ACCORDING
TO
THE
OXFORD
DICTIONARY
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
THEY
IMPLY
THAT
THE
NEW
CANON
LAW
RETAINS
THIS
BUT
ID
RATHER
SEE
A
MORE
RECENT
AND
AUTHORITATIVE
SOURCE
NOTE
THAT
WHILE
A
CATHOLIC
PRIEST
IS
REQUIRED
FOR
CATHOLICS
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
DOES
RECOGNIZE
MARRIAGE
BETWEEN
BAPTIZED
NONCATHOLICS
AS
VALID
WITHOUT
A
PRIEST
