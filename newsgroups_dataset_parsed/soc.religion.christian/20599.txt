RE
ACCEPTING
JEESUS
IN
YOUR
HEART
DISCLAIMER
THROUGHOUT
THIS
POST
THERE
ARE
STATEMENTS
AND
QUESTIONS
WHICH
COULD
EASILY
BE
INTERPRETED
AS
BEING
SARCASTIC
THEY
ARE
NOT
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
THIS
REPLY
IN
THE
MOST
EVENHANDED
MANNER
THAT
I
CAN
WITH
NO
EMOTIONS
BOILING
TO
THE
SURFACE
AS
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
PLEASE
ACCEPT
THIS
AS
A
SERIOUS
ATTEMPT
TO
FOSTER
DIALOG
AND
REST
ASSURRED
THAT
I
MAKE
EVERY
ATTEMPT
TO
MAKE
FUN
OF
NO
ONE
EXCEPT
MYSELF
ERIC
MOLAS
WRITES
FIRSTLY
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
I
AM
NOT
POSTING
HERE
AS
AN
IMMATURE
FLAME
START
BUT
RATHER
TO
EXPRESS
AN
OPINION
TO
MY
INTENDED
AUDIENCE
THE
HUMAN
BEING
IS
AN
ANIMAL
WHO
HAS
DUE
TO
HISHER
ADVANCED
MENTAL
FACILITIES
DEVELOPED
RELIGIOUS
AS
A
SATISFIABLE
SOLUTION
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
UNEXPLAINABLE
HMMM
THERE
ARE
OTHER
ANIMALS
ON
THIS
PLANET
WITH
ADVANCED
MENTAL
FACILITIES
WHICH
HAVE
NOT
DEVELOPED
RELIGION
AS
A
SATISFACTORY
EXPLAINATION
FOR
THE
UNEXPLAINED
WHY
IS
THIS
SO
FURTHER
IT
APPEARS
THAT
ONLY
HUMANS
HAVE
A
NEED
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
UNEXPLAINED
WHY
IS
THIS
SO
THE
OTHER
ANIMALS
ON
THIS
PLANET
INCLUDING
THOSE
WITH
ADVANCED
MENTAL
FACILITIES
SEEM
PERFECTLY
CONTENT
IN
THEIR
IGNORANCE
ID
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
YOUR
PRESUPPOSITIONS
SCREAM
OUT
AT
ME
FROM
YOUR
UNSUPPORTED
STATEMENT
THEY
ARE
HUMANS
ARE
ANIMAL
ONLY
RELIGION
EXISTS
AS
A
CRUTCH
SO
THAT
THE
UNEXPLAINED
NEED
NOT
BE
RESEARCHED
RELIGION
WAS
MADE
UP
BY
HUMANS
TO
ADDRESS
A
PERCEIVED
NEED
THE
BIOLOGICAL
ASPECT
OF
HUMANS
IS
DEIFIED
THAT
IS
ALL
ASPECTS
OF
HUMAN
LIFE
CAN
BE
CATEGORIZED
IN
A
HIERARCHICAL
STRUCTURE
WITH
BIOLOGY
AT
THE
APEX
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
I
DISAGREE
WITH
YOUR
STRONG
OPINION
AND
THE
UNDERLYING
PRESUPPOSITIONS
CHRISTIANITY
IS
AN
INFECTIOUS
CULT
THE
REASONS
IT
FLOURISHES
ARE
BECAUSE
IT
GIVES
PEOPLE
WITHOUT
HOPE
OR
DRIVEN
PURPOSE
IN
LIFE
A
SAFETY
BLANKED
TO
HIDE
BEHIND
OH
WOWALL
I
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
FOLLOW
THIS
CHRISTIAN
MORAL
STANDARD
AND
I
GET
ETERNAL
HAPPINESS
FOR
ALL
OF
YOU
FOUND
JEEZUS
HOW
MANY
OF
YOU
WERE
ON
THE
BRINK
I
DISAGREE
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
AN
INFECTIOUS
CULT
IT
HAS
CERTAINLY
SHOWN
ITSELF
TO
BE
PERSISTENT
AS
A
BELIEF
SYSTEM
IN
SPITE
OF
VARIOUS
PERSECUTIONS
THROUGHOUT
THE
PAST
TWO
MILLENIA
THAT
IT
CONTINUES
TO
PERSEVERE
DOES
NOT
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
IT
IS
INFECTIOUS
IN
A
DERROGATORY
SENSE
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
IT
PROVIDES
A
WORKABLE
SYSTEM
FOR
ITS
ADHERENTS
AND
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
I
DISAGREE
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
A
SAFETY
BLANKET
WHICH
SUPPLANTS
HOPE
AND
PURPOSE
RATHER
IT
POINTS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
TO
THE
ONE
SOURCE
OF
HOPE
AND
PURPOSE
THERE
IS
NOTHING
HIDDEN
ABOUT
A
CHRISTIANS
SOURCE
FOR
HOPE
AND
PURPOSE
OF
WHAT
USEFULNESS
TO
YOU
IS
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
INTERNALLY
MOTIVATED
HOPE
AND
PURPOSE
AND
EXTERNALLY
GIVEN
HOPE
AND
PURPOSE
IS
THE
APPARENT
LOSS
OF
CONTROL
OVER
ONES
OWN
LIFE
THE
PROBLEM
OR
IS
IT
SOMETHING
ELSE
FINALLY
ONE
DOES
NOT
APPROPRIATE
ETERNAL
HAPPINESS
BY
FOLLOWING
CHRISTIAN
MORAL
STANDARDS
INDEED
THE
SOLE
REASON
FOR
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IS
BECAUSE
STANDARDS
ARE
INADEQUATE
TO
SAVE
PEOPLE
FROM
THEIR
IMPERFECTIONS
MORAL
STANDARDS
ARE
MERELY
GUIDES
TO
THE
CHRISTIAN
THE
REAL
POWER
TO
MORAL
LIVING
IS
GIVEN
TO
THE
CHRISTIAN
IN
THE
PERSON
OF
GODS
SPIRIT
HEAVEN
IS
ONE
OF
TWO
FINAL
STATES
THAT
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
POSTULATES
HOWEVER
CHRISTIANS
ARE
GENERALLY
NOT
MOTIVATED
TO
LIVE
ACCORDING
TO
CHRISTIAN
MORAL
STANDARDS
BY
THIS
PROMISED
FUTURE
REWARD
RATHER
THEY
ARE
MOTIVATED
BY
THE
PERCEIVED
BENEFITS
TO
THEM
IN
THE
HEREANDNOW
BUT
I
DIGRESS
THE
OTHER
REASON
CHRISTIANITY
FLOURISHES
IS
ITS
INFECTIOUS
NATURE
A
BEST
FRIEND
OF
MINE
BREIFLY
ENTERED
A
CHRISTIAN
GROUP
AND
WITHIN
MONTHS
THEY
SET
MINISTRY
GUIDELINES
FOR
HIM
WHICH
BASICALY
SAID
THIS
PRIORITY
SPREAD
THE
WORD
MANY
CHRISTIAN
ORGANIZATIONS
ARE
CONCERNED
WITH
EVANGELISM
AS
A
PRIORITY
AND
RIGHTLY
SO
FOR
IT
WAS
JESUS
HIMSELF
WHO
GAVE
THIS
AS
A
PRIORITY
FOR
HIS
FOLLOWERS
HOWEVER
IT
IS
NOT
THE
PENULTIMATE
PRIORITY
AS
EVANGELISM
IS
NORMALLY
UNDERSTOOD
IE
PREACH
THE
WORD
CONVERT
AT
NEARLY
ANY
COST
REPEAT
WITH
NEW
CONVERT
AD
INFINITUM
RATHER
SUCH
EVANGELISM
IS
GENERALLY
BEST
DONE
THROUGH
RESPECTING
THE
OPINIONS
OF
OTHERS
WHILE
DEMONSTRATING
THE
VERY
REAL
BENEFITS
OF
A
CHRISTIAN
LIFESTYLE
THIS
DEMONSTRATION
SHOULD
BE
SO
POWERFUL
THAT
IT
COMPELS
THE
NONCHRISTIAN
TO
SEEK
OUT
THE
CHRISTIAN
TO
ASK
WHY
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
SUCH
A
DEMONSTRATION
IS
NOT
EASILY
ACCOM
PLISHED
IT
TAKES
A
RADICAL
COMMITTMENT
TO
THE
PERSON
OF
JESUS
IT
DOES
NOT
HAPPEN
QUICKLY
SO
PERSEVERANCE
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
IS
REQUIRED
AND
IT
CANNOT
OCCUR
WHERE
NO
PERSONAL
BONDS
OF
FRIENDSHIP
EXIST
IT
IS
INEFFECTIVE
WITH
STRANGERS
WHO
CANNOT
EVALUATE
THE
DEMONSTRATION
OVER
TIME
AND
IT
IS
EASY
TO
ALIENATE
OR
HARM
OTHERS
IF
THE
SOLE
PURPOSE
OF
BEING
A
FRIEND
IS
TO
GAIN
A
CONVERSION
AS
A
LONGTIME
CHRISTIAN
NEARLY
YEARS
I
VIEW
WITH
SOME
SKEP
TICISM
ALL
EVANGELISM
PROGRAMS
WHICH
INCORPORATE
A
HURRYUP
ATTITUDE
PRESSURED
CONVERSIONS
MAY
ULTIMATELY
BE
WORSE
THAN
NO
CONVERSION
AT
ALL
BECAUSE
THE
PRESSURED
CONVERT
REALIZES
SHE
WAS
COERCED
AND
DISAVOWS
CHRISTIANITY
WHEN
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
OPEN
TO
IT
IN
THE
FUTURE
HAD
THEY
NOT
BEEN
TAKEN
ADVANTAGE
OF
NOW
THE
BIBLE
STATES
THAT
IT
IS
THE
VERY
SPIRIT
OF
GOD
WHICH
BRINGS
CONVICTION
OF
WRONGDOING
TO
PEOPLE
I
AM
CONTENT
TO
DO
MY
PART
WITNESS
AND
LET
THE
SPIRIT
DO
THE
REST
WE
ARE
JUST
ANIMALS
WE
NEED
SLEEP
FOOD
AND
WE
REPRODUCE
AND
WE
DIE
WE
ARE
FAR
MORE
THAN
ANIMALS
WE
SLEEP
EAT
REPRODUCE
AND
DIE
JUST
AS
OTHER
ANIMALS
DO
TRUE
BUT
WE
ARE
ALSO
CAPABLE
OF
MORE
THAN
THIS
IF
YOUR
PERSONAL
VISION
OF
HUMANITY
OR
OF
YOURSELF
IS
SO
LIMITED
I
CAN
ONLY
HOPE
AND
PRAY
THAT
YOU
WILL
SOMEDAY
FIND
A
MORE
EXPANSIVE
VIEW
FOR
REFLECTION
WHAT
ANIMALS
HAVE
THE
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
PERFORMING
ARTS
THAT
HUMANS
DO
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
HUMANS
CAN
LEARN
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
OTHER
HUMANS
OR
ANIMALS
BUT
THAT
OTHER
ANIMALS
CANNOT
DO
SO
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
HUMANS
CAN
ORGANIZE
THEMSELVES
IN
VARIOUS
SOCIAL
STRUCTURES
WHEREAS
OTHER
ANIMALS
HAVE
ONLY
ONE
STRUCTURE
RELIGION
ESPECIALLY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
DRUG
BLATANT
ASSERTION
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOT
PHYSICALLY
ADDICTIVE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOT
PSYCHOLOGICALLY
ADDICTIVE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOT
A
THING
WHICH
ONE
SNORTSINGESTSSHOOTSUP
IT
IS
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
A
LIVING
BEING
YOU
MIGHT
AS
VALIDLY
CHARACTERIZE
ANY
CLOSE
KNIT
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THIS
APPELATION
SOME
PEOPLE
USE
DRUGS
AS
AN
ESCAPE
FROM
REALITY
CHRISTIANS
INJECT
THEMSELVES
WITH
JEEZUS
AND
LIVE
WITH
THAT
HIGH
THERE
ARE
JESUS
FREAKS
WHO
LET
THE
EMOTIONAL
ASPECTS
OF
WORSHIP
AND
CHRISTIAN
LIVING
GAIN
AND
RETAIN
THE
UPPER
HAND
EVEN
SO
THIS
DOES
NOT
BY
ITSELF
INVALIDATE
THE
FOUNDATION
FROM
WHICH
THESE
THINGS
FLOW
IT
PITIES
ME
HOW
MANY
MILLIONS
OF
LIVES
HAVE
BEEN
LOST
IN
RELIGIOUS
WARS
OF
WHICH
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
HAD
NO
SMALL
PART
GUILTY
BY
ASSOCIATION
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
WHICH
FORCES
ITSELF
UPON
ANOTHER
IS
NOT
CHRISTIANITY
AT
ALL
WHEN
CHRISTIANS
SEE
A
NONBELIEVER
THEY
SAY
THAT
PERSON
IS
BLIND
TO
THE
TRUTH
BUT
THEY
CANNOT
REALIZE
THAT
IT
IS
THEY
WHO
LIVE
WITH
THIS
MASK
OF
FAKENESS
EACH
DAY
JESUS
WAS
JUST
PROPHET
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
HAVE
A
LARGE
INFLUENCE
BECAUSE
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
ROMANS
WERE
CIRCA
DISPERSING
THE
JEWISH
POPULATION
AND
COMMUNITIES
NEEDED
SOME
SORT
OF
COHESIVE
ELEMENT
TO
KEEP
THEM
STRONG
IN
THAT
TIME
OF
DIRE
NEED
YOU
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
AN
AMAZING
CERTAINTY
ABOUT
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENED
YEARS
AGO
HOW
DID
YOU
COME
BY
IT
I
CANNOT
ACCEPT
YOUR
CONCLUSION
THAT
JESUS
INFLUENCE
WAS
A
SOLE
RESULT
OF
THE
ROMAN
SACK
OF
JERUSALEM
IN
HE
WAS
YEARS
GONE
BY
THIS
TIME
IT
STRAINS
THE
BOUNDS
OF
CREDULITY
TO
ASSERT
THAT
NOTHING
ABOUT
JESUS
LIFE
WAS
NOTEWORTHY
UNTIL
THE
SACK
I
MUST
GO
THESE
ARE
BUT
A
FEW
OF
MY
THOUGHTS
ON
CHRISTIANITY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
HAVING
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
JESUS
CHRIST
HIMSELF
WHAT
DO
YOU
KNOW
OF
HIM
WE
READ
THE
WORLD
WRONG
PHIL

AND
SAY
THAT
IT
