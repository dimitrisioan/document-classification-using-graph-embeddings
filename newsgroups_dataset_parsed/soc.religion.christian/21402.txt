PEIRYUAN
YEH
ASKS
I
WONDER
IF
THE
OT
IS
NOT
EXACTLY
LIKE
JEWISH
HISTORY
ARE
THEY
THE
SAME
OR
PART
OF
THEM
ARE
THE
SAME
HOW
ABOUT
TORAH
ARE
THE
FIRST
FIVE
BOOKS
OF
OT
AS
THE
SAME
AS
TORAH
YES
YES
AND
YES
JEWISH
HISTORY
AS
RECORDED
IN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
AND
AS
SHOWN
BY
ARCHAEOLOGY
ARE
THE
SAME
KINGS
REVIVALS
TEMPLES
AND
ALL
THE
TORAH
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
IS
THE
FIVE
BOOKS
OF
MOSES
THEN
COME
THE
PROPHETS
ALL
THE
PROPHETS
PLUS
JOSHUA
JUDGES
SAMUEL
KINGS
AND
THE
WRITINGS
PSALMS
PROVERBS
LAMENTATIONS
RUTH
ESTHER
EZRA
NEHEMIAH
ECCLESIATES
SONG
OF
SONGS
CHRONICLES
JOB
AND
THE
VERACITY
OF
ISAIAH
WHICH
YOU
QUOTED
TO
YOUR
MOSLEM
FRIEND
IS
QUITE
WELL
KNOWN
A
COMPLETE
MANUSCRIPT
EXISTS
THAT
DATES
BACK
TO
PAST
BC
AND
IS
KEPT
IN
A
MUSEUM
IN
ISRAEL
IT
WAS
FOUND
AMONG
THE
DEAD
SEA
SCROLLS
WHICH
GREATLY
ENHANCED
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
VERACITY
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
AS
THEY
DATE
BACK
TO
AROUND
THE
TIME
OF
CHRIST
WHEREAS
BEFORE
THE
OLDEST
COMPLETE
MANUSCRIPT
IN
HEBREW
WAS
FROM
AROUND
AD
YOUR
MOSLEM
FRIEND
IS
SORELY
MISTAKEN
BUT
UNDERSTANDABLY
SO
IF
JESUS
WAS
CRUCIFIED
AND
ATONED
FOR
OUR
SINS
HE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
GOD
FOR
ONLY
THE
DEATH
OF
GOD
COULD
ATONE
FOR
THE
SINS
OF
ALL
HUMANITY
AND
AS
ISAIAH
PREDICTS
THE
MESSIAH
WILL
BE
CALLED
THE
MIGHTY
GOD
AND
IF
HE
WAS
GOD
THEN
HE
MUST
HAVE
ROSE
FOR
AS
ST
PAUL
WROTE
IT
WAS
NOT
POSSIBLE
THAT
DEATH
COULD
HOLD
HIM
AND
IF
JESUS
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
YOUR
MOSLEM
FRIEND
WOULD
HAVE
LITTLE
REASON
TO
BE
A
MOSLEM
WHICH
IS
WHY
HE
DENIES
THE
AUTHENTICITY
OF
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
