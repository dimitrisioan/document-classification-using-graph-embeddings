please
define
cell
church
i
missed
it
somewhere
in
the
past
when
this
was
brought
up
before
in
a
cell
church
the
fundamental
building
block
is
the
cell
group
a
small
group
of
no
more
than
believers
the
small
groups
are
responsible
for
the
ministry
of
the
church
evangelism
and
discipleship
the
emphasis
is
on
relationships
not
on
programs
and
both
the
evangelism
and
the
discipling
are
relationshipbased
this
will
probably
raise
more
questions
than
it
answered
but
thats
it
in
a
nutshell
