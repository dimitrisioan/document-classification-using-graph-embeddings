MARYS
ASSUMPTION
A
FEW
POINTS
ABOUT
MARYS
BEING
TAKEN
INTO
HEAVEN
AT
THE
END
OF
HER
LIFE
ON
EARTH
ONE
PIECE
OF
EVIDENCE
FOR
MARYS
ASSUMPTION
INTO
HEAVEN
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
NO
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
EVER
CLAIMED
TO
BE
THE
SIGHT
WHERE
SHE
WAS
BURIED
SOME
CHRISTIAN
CHURCHES
CLAIMED
TO
BE
LOCATED
AT
THE
FINAL
RESTING
PLACES
OF
PETER
MARK
AND
OTHER
SAINTS
BUT
NO
ONE
EVER
CLAIMED
TO
POSSESS
THE
BODY
OF
MARY
THE
GREATEST
OF
THE
SAINTS
WHY
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
KNEW
THAT
SHE
HAD
BEEN
TAKEN
UP
INTO
HEAVEN
ALTHOUGH
THERE
IS
NO
DEFINITIVE
SCRIPTURAL
PROOF
FOR
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
SOME
PASSAGES
SEEM
SUGGESTIVE
LIKE
THE
PASSAGE
IN
REVELATION
THAT
DESCRIBES
A
WOMAN
GIVING
BIRTH
TO
A
SON
AND
LATER
BEING
CROWNED
IN
THE
HEAVENS
OF
COURSE
THE
WOMAN
IN
THIS
PASSAGE
HAS
OTHER
INTERPRETATIONS
SHE
CAN
ALSO
BE
TAKEN
A
SYMBOL
FOR
THE
CHURCH
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
MAKES
SENSE
BECAUSE
OF
HER
RELATIONSHIP
TO
CHRIST
JESUS
PERFECT
GOD
AND
PERFECT
MAN
FULFILLED
THE
REQUIREMENTS
OF
THE
LAW
PERFECTLY
UNDER
THE
LAW
GOD
GAVE
TO
US
WE
ARE
TO
HONOR
OUR
MOTHER
AND
FATHER
AND
CHRISTS
ACT
OF
TAKING
HIS
MOTHER
INTO
HEAVEN
IS
PART
OF
HIS
FULFILLMENT
OF
THAT
LAW
ALSO
HE
TOOK
HIS
FLESH
FROM
HER
SO
IT
SEEMS
APPROPRIATE
THAT
HE
DECIDE
NOT
TO
ALLOW
HER
FLESH
TO
ROT
IN
THE
GRAVE
ONE
LAST
POINT
AN
EXCATHOLIC
ATTEMPTED
TO
EXPLAIN
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
BY
ASSERTING
IT
IS
CONNECTED
TO
A
BELIEF
THAT
MARY
DID
NOT
DIE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
CORRECT
SUMMARY
OF
WHAT
CATHOLICS
BELIEVE
THE
DOGMA
OF
THE
ASSUMPTION
WAS
CAREFULLY
PHRASED
TO
AVOID
SAYING
WHETHER
MARY
DID
OR
DID
NOT
DIE
IN
FACT
THE
CONSENSUS
AMONG
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGIANS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
MARY
IN
FACT
DID
DIE
THIS
WOULD
MAKE
SENSE
CHRIST
DIED
AND
HIS
MOTHER
WHO
WAITED
AT
THE
FOOT
OF
THE
CROSS
WOULD
WANT
TO
SHARE
IN
HIS
DEATH
BRIAN
FINNERTY
