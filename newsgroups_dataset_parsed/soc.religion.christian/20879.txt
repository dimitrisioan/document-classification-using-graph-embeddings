I
THINK
ITS
REALLY
SAD
THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
PUT
THEIR
FAITH
IN
A
MERE
MAN
EVEN
IF
HE
DID
CLAIM
TO
BE
THE
SON
OF
GOD
ANDOR
A
PROPHET
ILL
POSE
A
QUESTION
HERE
THATS
GOT
ME
THINKING
WHAT
DISTINGUISHES
TRUE
RELIGION
FROM
CULTS
IM
SPEAKING
GENERALLY
HERE
NOT
SPECIFIALLY
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
JERRY
FALWELL
WAS
ON
GOOD
MORNING
AMERICA
ON
TUESDAY
OSTENSIBLY
TO
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
BASICALLY
HE
SAID
THAT
TRUE
RELIGION
FOLLOWS
A
MESSAGE
WHEREAS
A
CULT
FOLLOWS
A
PERSON
BUT
THEN
CHRISTIANITY
IS
A
CULT
BECAUSE
THE
MESSAGE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IS
THE
PERSON
OF
JESUS
SO
WHAT
DISTINGUISHES
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
BRANCH
DAVIDIAN
CULT
FROM
THE
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH
DOCTRINAL
DIFFERENCES
DONT
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
IMHO
SO
DONT
USE
THEM
AS
AN
ANSWER
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
ONE
OF
THE
BIG
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
DAVIDIANS
AND
CHRISTIANS
IS
IN
WHO
THEY
FOLLOW
I
HAVE
SOMETIMES
TRIED
TO
PUT
MYSELF
IN
THE
FEET
OF
ONE
OF
JESUSS
DISCIPLES
BASICALLY
THEY
GAVE
UP
A
LOT
CAREER
POSSIBLY
FAMILY
AND
WELL
A
WHOLE
BUNCH
TO
FOLLOW
JESUS
SO
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
IT
IS
QUITE
PLAIN
JESUS
WAS
GOOD
AND
DAVID
KORESH
WAS
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
I
THINK
IS
THAT
WE
TRY
TO
LEGISLATE
WHAT
IS
GOOD
AND
WHAT
IS
BAD
IN
TERMS
OF
PRINCIPLES
FOR
INSTANCE
THERE
ARE
THOUSANDS
OF
LAWS
IN
THE
US
GOVERNING
WHAT
IS
LEGAL
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
OFTEN
IT
IS
HARD
TO
BRING
PEOPLE
TO
JUSTICE
BECAUSE
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
FIND
A
LEGAL
WAY
TO
DO
IT
IF
ONLY
WE
COULD
TRUST
JUDGES
TO
BE
JUST
THEN
WE
COULD
TELL
THEM
TO
ADMINISTER
JUSTICE
FAIRLY
AND
JUSTICE
WOULD
BE
FOLLOWED
BUT
SINCE
JUDGES
DONT
ALWAYS
GET
IT
RIGHT
WE
HAVE
A
COMPLICATED
SYSTEM
INVOLVING
PRECEDENT
AND
BUNCHES
OF
OTHER
STUFF
WHICH
ATTEMPT
TO
MAKE
THE
IMPERFECT
THE
JUSTICE
OF
MAN
INTO
SOMETHING
PERFECT
BUT
WHAT
I
HEAR
ABOUT
THE
JUSTICE
SYSTEM
IN
THE
US
TELLS
ME
THAT
QUITE
THE
OPPOSITE
IS
TRUE
THERE
IS
ALSO
A
PROBLEM
THAT
WE
TEND
TO
JUDGE
THE
PRESENTATION
MORE
THAN
THE
MATERIAL
BEING
PRESENTED
SO
WE
MIGHT
CONSIDER
A
RANTING
CHRISTIAN
TO
BE
BAD
BUT
AN
ELOQUENT
PERSON
FROM
ANOTHER
RELIGION
TO
BE
GOOD
THIS
GOES
ALONG
WITH
THE
AMERICAN
DESIRE
TO
PROTECT
THE
CONSTITUTION
AT
ALL
COSTS
EVEN
IF
IT
ALLOWS
PEOPLE
TO
DO
BAD
THINGS
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
THE
MESSAGE
THAT
IS
IMPORTANT
IF
A
MAN
IS
PRESENTING
A
FALSE
MESSAGE
EVEN
IF
HE
IS
EVER
EVER
SO
MILD
MANNERED
THEN
THAT
MAN
IS
PERFORMING
A
TREMENDOUS
DISSERVICE
I
KNOW
THAT
I
AM
RAMBLING
HERE
I
GUESS
THAT
WHAT
I
AM
TRYING
TO
SAY
IS
THAT
WE
SHOULDNT
BE
LOOKING
FOR
PRINCIPLES
THAT
TELL
US
WHY
THE
DAVIDIANS
GOT
IT
WRONG
IT
IS
NOT
WRONG
TO
FOLLOW
AND
WORSHIP
A
PERSON
BUT
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
CHOOSE
THE
RIGHT
PERSON
IT
IS
SIMPLE
CHOOSE
JESUS
AND
YOU
GOT
IT
RIGHT
CHOOSE
ANYONE
ELSE
AND
YOU
GOT
IT
WRONG
WHY
BECAUSE
JESUS
IS
THE
BEGOTTEN
SON
OF
GOD
AND
NOBODY
ELSE
IS
JESUS
WAS
WITHOUT
SIN
AND
NOBODY
ELSE
WAS
