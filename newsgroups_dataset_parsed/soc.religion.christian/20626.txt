WRITES
IN

CARALVCARALVAUTOTROLCOM
CAROL
ALVIN
WRITES
ARE
ALL
TRUTHS
ALSO
ABSOLUTES
IS
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
TRUTHS
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTES
THE
ANSWER
TO
BOTH
QUESTIONS
IS
YES
PERHAPS
WE
HAVE
DIFFERENT
DEFINITIONS
OF
ABSOLUTE
THEN
TO
ME
AN
ABSOLUTE
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
CONSTANT
ACROSS
TIME
CULTURE
SITUATIONS
ETC
TRUE
IN
EVERY
INSTANCE
POSSIBLE
DO
YOU
AGREE
WITH
THIS
DEFINITION
I
THINK
YOU
DO
SIMILARLY
ALL
TRUTH
IS
ABSOLUTE
INDEED
A
NONABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IS
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
WHEN
IS
SOMETHING
ABSOLUTE
WHEN
IT
IS
ALWAYS
TRUE
OBVIOUSLY
IF
A
TRUTH
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
TRUE
THEN
WE
HAVE
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
I
AGREE
WITH
CAROL
HERE
DETERMINING
ABSOLUTES
IS
PRACTICALLY
SPEAKING
A
WASTE
OF
TIME
AND
WE
EASILY
FORGET
THAT
RELATIVE
TRUTH
IS
IN
FACT
RELATIVE
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
RECENTLY
WAS
ASKING
SOME
CHILDREN
THE
QUESTION
WHAT
TEMPERATURE
DOES
WATER
BOIL
AT
I
GOT
THE
ANSWER
DEGREES
CONSISTENTLY
I
ASKED
IF
THEY
KNEW
WHAT
SCALE
AND
WAS
TOLD
ITS
JUST
DEGREES
ANY
SCALE
THATS
WHAT
ALL
THERMOMETERS
SAY
WELL
THATS
SINCERE
AND
MAY
BE
TRUE
IN
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
SPEAKER
BUT
IT
IS
SIMPLY
WRONG
IT
IS
NOT
AN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
SIMILARLY
SCRIPTURE
IS
FULL
OF
TRUTH
WHICH
WE
SHOULD
NURTURE
AND
CHERISH
BUT
TRYING
TO
DETERMINE
WHICH
PARTS
ARE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AND
WHICH
PARTS
ARE
THE
MANIFESTATIONS
OF
THAT
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
TIME
AND
CULTURE
IN
WHICH
THE
TEXT
WAS
PENNED
IS
MISSING
THE
POINT
THEN
RELIGION
EASILY
BECOMES
AN
INTELLECTUAL
HEADTRIP
DEVOID
OF
THE
LIVING
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
INDWELLING
TRINITY
AND
BECOMES
DEAD
SCHOLASTICISM
IMO
EXAMPLE
OF
HEADCOVERING
IN
CHURCH
DELETED
THIS
WAS
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
THERE
MAY
BE
AN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
BEHIND
THE
WRITING
BUT
THE
SIMPLEST
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
PASSAGE
IS
THAT
THE
INSTRUCTIONS
APPLY
TO
THE
CORINTHIANS
AND
NOT
NECESSARILY
ELSEWHERE
THE
INSTRUCTIONS
MAY
REFLECT
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
FIRST
CENTURY
CULTURE
AND
THE
PARTICULAR
CLIMATE
AT
CORINTH
WHICH
WAS
HAVING
A
LOT
OF
TROUBLE
WITH
ORDER
IS
IT
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
TO
ME
NO
AND
I
SEE
NO
COMPELLING
OR
EVEN
REASONABLE
REASON
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
EVANGELICALS
ARE
CLEARLY
NOT
TAKING
THIS
PARTICULAR
PART
OF
SCRIPTURE
TO
BE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AND
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
OTHER
EXAMPLES
CAN
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
EVEN
THE
MOST
DIEHARD
LITERALISTS
DO
NOT
TAKE
ALL
OF
THE
BIBLE
LITERALLY
IVE
YET
TO
MEET
ANYONE
WHO
TAKES
THE
VERSE
BLESSED
IS
HE
WHO
TAKES
YOUR
BABIES
AND
SMASHES
THEIR
HEADS
AGAINST
THE
ROCKS
LITERALLY
THE
BIBLE
WAS
NOT
PRINTED
OR
HANDED
TO
US
BY
GOD
WITH
COLOR
CODINGS
TO
TELL
US
WHAT
PARTS
SHOULD
BE
INTERPRETED
WHICH
WAY
MANY
PEOPLE
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
WORLD
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
IS
TERRIBLY
SELFCONTRADICTORY
LET
ME
PUT
IT
TO
YOU
THIS
WAY
IF
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
SHOULDNT
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
STATEMENT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
IS
NOT
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE
OBVIOUSLY
WE
HAVE
A
CONTRADICTION
HERE
I
DONT
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
THOUGH
AND
DETERMINING
ABSOLUTES
IS
DIFFICULT
I
AGREE
VERY
FEW
AND
EVEN
IF
WE
KNEW
THEM
PERSONALLY
WE
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
EXPRESS
THAT
IN
A
WAY
THAT
STILL
CONVEYS
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
TO
ANOTHER
THE
PRESENCE
OF
ABSENCE
OF
ABSOLUTES
MAY
NOT
MAKE
ANY
DIFFERENCE
SINCE
I
KNOW
I
CAN
NEVER
FULLY
APPREHEND
AN
ABSOLUTE
IF
IT
WALKS
UP
AND
GREETS
ME
THERE
IS
HARDLY
CONSENSUS
EVEN
IN
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANITY
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
REST
OF
CHRISTIANITY
REGARDING
BIBLICAL
INTERPRETATION
SO
PEOPLE
SOMETIMES
DISAGREE
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
TRUE
THIS
DOES
NOT
NEGATE
THE
FACT
HOWEVER
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
UNIVERSE
I
CANT
PROVE
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ABSOLUTES
I
CAN
ONLY
RELY
UPON
MY
EXPERIENCE
I
ALSO
TRUST
GODS
REVELATION
THAT
WE
CANNOT
FULLY
COMPREHEND
THE
INFINITE
THEREFORE
WE
CANT
COMPREHEND
THE
ABSOLUTES
SO
I
DONT
NEED
THEM
I
CAN
NEVER
KNOW
THE
ESSENCE
OF
GOD
ONLY
THE
ENERGIES
BY
AND
THROUGH
WHICH
GOD
IS
MANIFESTED
TO
GODS
CREATION
SO
THE
REALITY
CAN
BE
THAT
THERE
ARE
ABSOLUTES
BUT
IT
IS
OF
NO
PRACTICAL
IMPORTANCE
ITS
LIKE
CLAIMING
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
SCRIPTURAL
AUTOGRAPHS
WERE
PERFECT
BUT
COPIES
MAY
NOT
BE
SWELL
WHO
CARES
IT
DOESNT
AFFECT
ME
IN
ANY
PRACTICAL
USEFUL
WAY
I
MIGHT
AS
WELL
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
HAS
MADE
A
LOT
OF
ELECTRIC
BLUE
CHICKENS
AND
THAT
THEY
LIVE
ON
MARS
MAYBE
GOD
DID
SO
WHAT
IS
THAT
GOING
TO
HAVE
ANY
EFFECT
ON
HOW
I
DEAL
WITH
MY
NEIGHBOR
OR
GOD
WHETHER
OR
NOT
I
GO
TO
THIS
OR
THAT
CAFETERIA
FOR
LUNCH
NO
THIS
ATTITUDE
LEADS
MANY
NONCHRISTIANS
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ALL
CHRISTIANS
ARE
ARROGANT
IDIOTS
INCAPABLE
OF
CRITICAL
REASONING
CHRISTIANITY
IS
TRUE
WONDERFUL
AND
SENSIBLE
IT
APPEALS
TO
REASON
SINCE
REASON
IS
AN
INNER
REFLECTION
OF
THE
LOGOS
OF
GOD
EXPLANATIONS
THAT
VIOLATE
THAT
SIMPLY
APPEAR
TO
BE
INSECURE
AUTHORITARIAN
RESPONSES
TO
A
COMPLEX
WORLD
NOTE
IM
NOT
CLAIMING
THERE
IS
NO
PLACE
FOR
AUTHORITY
THATD
BE
SILLY
THERE
IS
A
WORLD
OF
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
AUTHORITATIVE
AND
AUTHORITARIAN
AUTHORITATIVE
IS
EN
EXPRESSION
OF
AUTHORITY
THAT
RESPECTS
OTHERS
AUTHORITARIAN
IS
EN
EXPRESSION
OF
AUTHORITY
THAT
FAILS
TO
DO
THAT
AND
IS
GENERALLY
AGRESSIVE
GOOD
PARENTS
LIKE
GOD
ARE
AUTHORITATIVE
MANY
CHRISTIANS
ARE
SIMPLY
AUTHORITARIAN
AND
NOT
SURPRISINGLY
FEW
ADULTS
RESPOND
TO
THIS
