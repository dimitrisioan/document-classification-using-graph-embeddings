SOPHOMORE
ROMANS
THE
SOPHOMORE
SAYS
WHAT
IS
TRUTH
AND
TURNS
TO
BASK
IN
THE
ADMIRATION
OF
HIS
PEERS
HOW
MODERN
HOW
DARING
HOW
LIBERATING
HOW
MODERN
HOW
DARING
HOW

BEING
AMERICAN
DOESNT
KNOW
THAT
HIS

MODERN
SKEPTICAL
CYNICAL
WAS
ASKED
BEFORE
BY
A
MODERN
SKEPTICAL
CYNICAL
URBANE
COSMOPOLITAN
POLITICIAN
APPOINTED
NOT
ELECTED
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
LIVE
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
AGO
LIKE
MANY
POLITICIANS
HE
CARED
LESS
ABOUT
IDEALS
THAN
RESULTS
LESS
ABOUT
ENDS
THAN
MEANS
LESS
ABOUT
ANYTHING
THAN
KEEPING
HIS
JOB
AND
HIS
HEAD
WE
MIGHT
CALL
HIM
A
BIT
BRUTAL
THOUGH
FIRM
WOULD
BE
KINDER
AND
NO
DOUBT
STALIN
WHO
LET
NOBODY
GO
LAUGHED
AT
HIS
LAXNESS
HE
DIDNT
LIKE
HIS
JOB
PERHAPS
HE
NO
LONGER
HOPED
FOR
BETTER
NOR
FEARED
WORSE
EXCEPT
REGARDING
HIS
HEAD

KILLED
THEIR
MADMAN
HED
START
A
RIOT

SAVED
THE
KING
OF
THE
JEWS
HED
PISS
OFF

DO
WITH
THE
RIGHTEOUS
LOUT
SHE
DIDNT
TELL
HIM
ANYTHING

TO
SEE
HEROD

JUST
HAPPENED
TO
BE
IN
TOWN
HEROD
APPRECIATED
THE
COURTESY
BUT
WASNT
WORRIED
AND
SENT
THE
SHARPTONGUED
FOOL
WHO
SUDDENLY
DIDNT
HAVE
MUCH
TO
SAY
FUNNY
HOW

BACK
IN
THE
ATTIRE
PROPER

HAD
HIS
FUN
A
LITTLE
JOKE
SHORT
TO
THE

TRILINGUAL
AND
ALL
THIS
WENT
AS
IT
ALWAYS
DOES
WHEN
SOMEONE
GETS
CAUGHT
IN
THE
GEARS
OF
GOVERNMENT
AND
THERES
A
SCIENTIFIC
EXPLANATION
NO
DOUBT
FOR
THE
SUPERSTITIOUS
RUMORS
PERSISTING
TO
THIS
DAY
THAT
IT
DIDNT
ALL
END
WITH
A
TOMB
AND
A
ROMAN
SQUADRON
ON

OUR
SOPHOMORE
DOESNT
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
HE
DOESNT
RECOGNIZE
HIS
