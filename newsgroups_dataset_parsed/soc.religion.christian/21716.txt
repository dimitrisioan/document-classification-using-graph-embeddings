RE
ON
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
IN
ARTICLE
RANDAL
LEE
NICHOLAS
MANDOCK
WRITES
SAFETY
TO
THE
DEGREE
THAT
MEANS
OTHER
THAN
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
AND
MILITARY
OPERATIONS
ARE
SUFFICIENT
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
THEN
THESE
NONVIOLENT
PROVISIONS
ARE
TO
BE
PREFERRED
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
MORE
IN
PROPORTION
AND
IN
KEEPING
WITH
THE
FINAL
GOAL
OF
PROTECTION
OF
PEACE
AND
HUMAN
DIGNITY
THANKS
FOR
POSTING
THE
EXACT
WORDING
WHICH
I
HAD
NOT
SEEN
PREVIOUSLY
THE
PART
I
QUOTE
ABOVE
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
INDICATE
DISAPPROVAL
OF
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
IT
IS
TO
BE
USED
ONLY
WHEN
OTHER
MEANS
ARE
NOT
SUFFICIENT
I
WOULD
SAY
THIS
IS
A
STRONGER
RESTRICTION
THAN
SAYING
THAT
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
IS
USEABLE
WHEN
JUSTIFIABLE
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
SAY
THERE
ARE
CASES
WHERE
A
CRIME
JUSTIFIES
DEATH
PERHAPS
THIS
IS
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
INTERPRETATION
BUT
MY
REVERENCE
FOR
LIFE
WOULD
SAY
THAT
I
WOULD
OPPOSE
THE
ACTUAL
INFLICTION
OF
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
A
NEW
TESTAMENT
INTERPRETATION
IT
IS
A
MATTER
FOR
DEBATE
WHETHER
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
WORKS
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
IN
A
WAY
THAT
NONVIOLENT
PROVISIONS
DO
NOT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IT
DOES
AND
I
WOULD
CERTAINLY
OBSERVE
THAT
IN
THE
USA
WHERE
YOU
HAVE
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
THERE
IS
A
FAR
HIGHER
MURDER
RATE
THAN
HERE
IN
THE
UK
WHERE
WE
DO
NOT
