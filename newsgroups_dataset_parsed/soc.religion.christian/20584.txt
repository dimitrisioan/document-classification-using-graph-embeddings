RE
EVERY
LENT
HE
SUFFERS
TO
SAVE
US
THE
STORY
I
RELATED
IS
ONE
OF
THE
SEVEN
APPARITIONS
APPROVED
BY
OUR
CHURCH
AS
WORTHY
OF
BELIEF
IT
HAPPENED
IN
LA
SALLE
FRANCE
THE
MORAL
LESSON
OF
THE
STORY
IS
THE
LAMB
OF
GOD
HAS
BEEN
SACRIFICED
AND
HIS
BLOOD
HAS
BEEN
USED
TO
CLEANSE
US
OF
OUR
SINS
EVERY
MOMENT
AS
GOD
PERCEIVES
WORTHY
OF
BEING
DONE
IN
HEAVEN
MARY
WEEPS
FOR
THE
LAMB
AND
FOR
THE
REST
OF
HER
OFFSPRINGS
THIS
WILL
CONTINUE
WHILE
WE
DISOBEY
GOD
OR
SIN
AGAINST
HIM
MARY
AS
A
MESSENGER
HAS
BEEN
GIVEN
THE
TASK
TO
MAKE
US
BE
AWARE
OF
THE
EVIL
SERPENT
COMMUNISM
WARS
FAMINE
UNFAITHFUL
DISOBEDIENCE
TO
GOD
ETC
RUNNING
AFTER
THE
REST
OF
HER
OFFSPRINGS
THE
CHILDREN
WHO
WENT
ASTRAY
BY
DISOBEDIENCE
LED
BY
THE
DRAGON
IS
BROUGHT
BACK
BY
HER
PEACE
AND
LOVING
MESSAGES
REPARATIONS
FOR
SINS
TO
OBEY
GODS
COMMANDMENTS
AND
BE
MORE
WORTHY
TO
BE
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
LAMB
AS
SHE
WAS
CONCEIVED
WITHOUT
SIN
TO
BE
WORTHY
OF
BEARING
THE
SON
OF
GOD
IN
HER
WOMB
MARY
HAS
BEEN
PREPARING
US
THE
CHURCH
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
FOR
HIS
SECOND
COMING
MAKING
SURE
WE
ARE
PROTECTED
FROM
THE
DRAGON
ALSO
SHE
HAS
BEEN
PREPARING
THE
NEW
EDEN
BY
REVERSING
THE
DEED
OF
THE
ANCIENT
EVE
THE
NEW
EDEN
WILL
BE
THE
SANCTUARY
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS
AS
JUDGED
BY
CHRIST
IN
HIS
NEXT
COMING
I
RELATE
THE
STORY
AGAIN
I
BELIEVE
THIS
AND
MARY
IN
ONE
OF
HER
APPARITIONS
IN
OR
CENTURY
SHE
APPEARED
TO
THESE
TWO
CHILDREN
WHO
TENDS
GOATS
AND
COWS
I
FORGOT
THE
EXACT
PLACE
SHE
WAS
WEEPING
AND
TELLING
THE
CHILDREN
THAT
SHE
IS
AFRAID
SHES
GOING
TO
LOSE
HER
SONS
ARM
SHE
IS
MOURNING
TOO
FOR
THESE
TOWNFOLKS
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
THEIR
FAULT
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
DROUGHT
IN
THEIR
HARVEST
NOT
MUCH
GOOD
FOOD
AGAIN
THIS
YEAR
AS
IT
WAS
LAST
YEAR
MARY
TELLS
THE
CHILDREN
MOST
OF
THE
TOWNFOLKS
IN
THIS
PLACE
WORKED
WHOLE
WEEK
EVEN
ON
SUNDAYS
WHEN
THEY
SHOULD
BE
IN
CHURCH
HONORING
GOD
THESE
TOWNFOLKS
SWEARS
AND
USES
HER
SONS
NAME
IN
BAD
WORDS
THAT
IS
WHY
HER
SONS
ARM
IS
SO
HEAVY
IN
PAIN
THEN
SHE
ASKED
THEM
IF
THEY
PRAY
THE
CHILDREN
SAID
HARDLY
SHE
ASKED
THEM
TO
PRAY
EVERY
MORNING
AND
NIGHT
WHEN
THE
CHILDREN
WENT
BACK
FROM
WORK
THEY
HAD
TO
TELL
SOMEBODY
ABOUT
THIS
WHEN
THE
NEWS
WAS
SPRED
AND
AFTER
THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
INCIDENT
THE
TOWNFOLKS
WERE
CONVERTED
AND
FAITH
AND
OBEDIENCE
TO
GOD
WERE
RESTORED
IN
THEIR
COMMUNITY
ONCE
AGAIN
THE
LAMB
SUCCEEDS
MARIDA
SPREADING
GODS
WORDS
THROUGH
ACTIONS
MOTHER
TERESA
