WHY
RELIGION
AND
WHICH
RELIGION
MY
FAMILY
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
PARTICULARLY
RELIGIOUS
SINGING
CHRISTMAS
CAROLS
IS
ABOUT
THE
LIMIT
FOR
THEM
THUS
IVE
NEVER
REALLY
BELIEVED
IN
GOD
AND
HEAVEN
ALTHOUGH
I
DONT
ACTUALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
DONT
EXIST
EITHER
IM
SORT
OF
UNDECIDED
PROBABLY
LIKE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
I
GUESS
LATELY
IVE
BEEN
THINKING
ABOUT
IT
ALL
A
LOT
MORE
AND
I
WONDERED
HOW
RELIGIOUS
PEOPLE
CAN
BE
SO
CONVINCED
THAT
THERE
IS
A
GOD
I
FEEL
AS
THOUGH
I
WANT
TO
BELIEVE
BUT
IM
NOT
USED
TO
BELIEVING
THINGS
WITHOUT
PROOF
JUST
AS
I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
DEFINITELY
ISNT
A
GOD
SO
I
CANT
DEFINITELY
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
IS
I
WONDERED
IF
MOST
OF
YOU
WERE
BROUGHT
UP
BY
RELIGIOUS
FAMILIES
AND
NEVER
BELIEVED
ANY
DIFFERENT
CAN
ANYONE
HELP
ME
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
YOUR
BELIEF
AND
FAITH
IN
GOD
CAN
BE
SO
STRONG
ANOTHER
QUESTION
THAT
FREQUENTLY
CROSSES
MY
MIND
IS
WHICH
RELIGION
IS
CORRECT
HOW
DO
YOU
CHOOSE
A
RELIGION
AND
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
EXISTS
AND
THE
GODS
OF
OTHER
RELIGIONS
DONT
HOW
DO
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
PEOPLE
WHO
FOLLOW
OTHER
RELIGIONS
HOW
ABOUT
ATHEISTS
AND
PEOPLE
LIKE
ME
AGNOSTICS
I
SUPPOSE
DO
YOU
RESPECT
THEIR
RELIGION
AND
ACCEPT
THEIR
BELIEFS
AS
JUST
AS
VALID
AS
YOUR
OWN
ISNT
THERE
CONTRADICTION
BETWEEN
THE
RELIGIONS
HOW
CAN
YOUR
RELIGION
BE
MORE
VALID
THAN
ANY
OTHERS
DO
YOU
HAVE
LESS
RESPECT
FOR
SOMEONE
IF
THEYRE
NOT
RELIGIOUS
OR
IF
THEY
FOLLOW
A
DIFFERENT
RELIGION
THAN
YOU
WOULD
IF
THEY
WERE
CHRISTIAN
ALSO
HOW
MUCH
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
ARE
CORRECT
ARE
ALL
EVENTS
IN
THE
BIBLE
REALLY
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
HAPPENED
OR
ARE
THEY
JUST
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
STORIES
WITH
MORALS
SHOWING
A
TRUE
CHRISTIAN
HOW
TO
BEHAVE
I
GENERALLY
FOLLOW
MOST
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
IDEAS
WHICH
I
SUPPOSE
ARE
FAIRLY
UNIVERSAL
THROUGHOUT
ALL
RELIGIONS
NOT
KILLING
STEALING
ETC
AND
LOVING
MY
NEIGHBOUR
FOR
WANT
OF
A
BETTER
EXPRESSION
THE
ONLY
PART
I
FIND
HARD
IS
THE
ACTUAL
BELIEF
IN
GOD
FINALLY
WHAT
IS
GODS
ATTITUDE
TO
PEOPLE
LIKE
ME
WHO
DONT
QUITE
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
BUT
ARE
GENERALLY
FAIRLY
GOOD
PEOPLE
SURELY
NOT
BELIEVING
DOESNT
MAKE
ME
A
WORSE
PERSON
IF
NOT
I
FIND
MYSELF
WONDERING
WHY
I
SO
STRONGLY
WANT
TO
REALLY
BELIEVE
AND
TO
FIND
A
RELIGION
SORRY
IF
I
WAFFLED
ON
A
BIT
I
WAS
JUST
WRITING
IDEAS
AS
THEY
CAME
INTO
MY
HEAD
IM
SURE
I
PROBABLY
REPEATED
MYSELF
A
BIT
TOO
THANKS
FOR
THE
HELP
PAUL
SIMMONS
THERES
BEEN
ENOUGH
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
EVIDENCE
FOR
CHRISTIANITY
RECENTLY
