A
WEEKLY
DIALOGUE
WITH
A
LOCAL
PASTOR
ON
THE
NEWS
OF
THE
DAY
BY

GENE
WILKES
STARTEXT
COMPUSERVE
INTERNET
THIS
WEEKS
THOUGHTS
LAST
WEEK
THE
SUPREME
COURT
REFUSED
WITHOUT
COMMENT
TO
HEAR
AN
APPEAL
BY
RENSSELAER
IN
SCHOOL
OFFICIALS
DESIRING
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
BIBLES
IN
THEIR
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
A
LOWER
COURT
HAD
BANNED
THE
LOCAL
GIDEONS
AN
INTERNATIONAL
BIBLE
DISTRIBUTION
GROUP
FROM
PASSING
OUT
BIBLES
TO
FIFTHGRADERS
THE
ACLUS
BARRY
LYNN
WAS
QUOTED
AS
SAYING
THAT
THE
COURTS
ACTION
PROTECTED
THE
RELIGIOUS
NEUTRALITY
OF
OUR
PUBLIC
SCHOOLS
HE
ALSO
SAID
THAT
SCHOOLS
MUST
SERVE
STUDENTS
OF
ALL
FAITHS
AND
NONE
SCHOOLS
WERE
NOT
TO
BE
A
BAZAAR
WHERE
RIVAL
RELIGIOUS
GROUPS
COMPETE
FOR
CONVERTS
ACCORDING
TO
LYNN
SEVERAL
GIDEONS
MEN
WHO
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
PUTTING
BIBLES
IN
HOSPITALS
AND
HOTELS
ARE
MEMBERS
OF
OUR
CHURCH
THEY
TELL
OF
SIMILAR
STORIES
WHERE
THEY
ARE
ONLY
ALLOWED
TO
DISTRIBUTE
BIBLES
ON
SIDEWALKS
AROUND
THE
SCHOOLS
BUT
CANNOT
GO
INSIDE
THE
SCHOOLS
THEY
TELL
OF
MILD
HARASSMENT
BY
PARENTS
WHO
DO
NOT
WANT
THEIR
CHILDREN
RECEIVING
A
BIBLE
FROM
A
STRANGER
THEY
ARE
WILLING
TO
CONTINUE
THEIR
WORK
AT
A
DISTANCE
BUT
FIND
THE
SCHOOLS
POSITION
SOMEWHAT
DISHEARTENING
I
UNDERSTAND
RATIONALLY
AND
LOGICALLY
THE
COURTS
POSITION
AND
I
CAN
SEE
THE
SENSE
OF
FAIRNESS
FOR
ALL
GROUPS
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WHEN
DOES
NEUTRALITY
BECOME
NIHILISM
WHEN
DOES
PLURALITY
TURN
INTO
NO
POSITION
AT
ALL
I
SEE
A
COUPLE
OF
IRONIES
HERE
ONE
IS
THAT
WE
CAN
PASS
OUT
CONDOMS
BUT
NOT
BIBLES
IN
OUR
SCHOOLS
THINK
ON
THAT
ONE
FOR
A
MOMENT
THE
OTHER
IS
THAT
WHILE
WE
ARE
SEEKING
RELIGIOUS
NEUTRALITY
IN
OUR
SCHOOLS
COUNTRIES
LIKE
RUSSIAWHO
BY
THE
WAY
PRACTICED
RELIGIOUS
NEUTRALITY
FOR
THE
PAST
SEVENTY
YEARSARE
MAKING
THE
BIBLE
PART
OF
THEIR
PUBLIC
SCHOOL
CURRICULUM
WHEN
I
WAS
IN
ST
PETERSBURG
IN
MARCH
THE
CHURCH
WE
WORKED
WITH
HAD
TRAINED
OVER
PUBLIC
SCHOOL
TEACHERS
TO
TEACH
THE
BIBLE
AND
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAD
REQUESTED
HUNDREDS
MORE
I
RECENTLY
HEARD
A
MEDICAL
DOCTOR
WHO
IS
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
GIDEON
CHAPTER
IN
MOSCOW
TELL
HOW
THEY
ARE
EAGERLY
INVITED
TO
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
MOSCOW
TO
DISTRIBUTE
BIBLES
TO
THE
STUDENTS
AND
ARE
GIVEN
CLASS
TIME
TO
EXPLAIN
ITS
CONTENTS
I
REMEMBER
SEEING
A
PHOTOGRAPH
OF
THIS
DOCTOR
HOLDING
A
BIBLE
AND
SPEAKING
TO
THE
UNIVERSITY
STUDENTS
STANDING
UNDER
A
STATUE
OF
LENIN
NOW
THATS
IRONIC
I
ADMIT
TWO
THINGS
WE
ARE
A
PLURALISTIC
SOCIETY
AND
ALL
FAITHS
HAVE
EQUAL
FOOTING
THIS
IS
WHAT
OUR
COUNTRY
WAS
FOUNDED
ON
TO
ALLOW
EVERY
GROUP
ON
SCHOOL
GROUNDS
COULD
CREATE
A
BAZAARLIKE
ATMOSPHERE
EACH
CITY
MUST
WORK
TO
BE
INCLUSIVE
OF
ALL
RELIGIONS
AND
PROVIDE
A
HEARING
FOR
THEM
KNOW
I
SAID
TWOTHE
VITALITY
OF
RELIGIOUS
FAITH
IS
NOT
DEPENDENT
UPON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
PUBLIC
ARENA
ACKNOWLEDGES
IT
AS
VALID
HOWEVERAND
YOU
KNEW
THIS
WAS
COMINGI
BELIEVE
DISALLOWING
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
THE
BIBLE
BY
LAWABIDING
CARING
ADULTS
IN
OUR
SCHOOLS
ONLY
SIGNALS
ONCE
AGAIN
OUR
CULTURES
MOVEMENT
AWAY
FROM
A
SINGULAR
BASE
FROM
WHICH
WE
AS
INDIVIDUALS
AND
AS
A
NATION
CAN
MAKE
MORAL
AND
ETHICAL
DECISIONS

I
AGREE
WITH

I

I
STILL

I
KNOW
THOSE
FAMILIES
YOU
SPEAK
OF

NOT

BUT
THE

DOES
NOT
