RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ARTICLE
VIRGILIO
DEAN

JR
WROTE
WE
AFFIRM
THE
ABSOLUTES
OF
SCRIPTURE
NOT
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
ARROGANT
MORALISTS
BUT
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
WHO
IS
TRUTH
WHO
HAS
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTH
IN
HIS
WORD
AND
THEREFORE
WE
HOLD
AS
PRECIOUS
THE
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
OF
THOSE
ABSOLUTES
PARDON
ME
A
HUMBLE
ATHEIST
BUT
EXACTLY
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
HOLDING
A
REVEALED
TRUTH
WITH
BLIND
FAITH
AS
ITS
BASIS
IE
REGARDLESS
OF
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
YOU
MAY
FIND
TO
THE
CONTRARY
AS
AN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
FULLY
EXPECTING
PEOPLE
TO
BELIEVE
YOU
AND
ARROGANCE
THEY
SOUND
LIKE
ONE
AND
THE
SAME
TO
ME
AND
NEARLY
EVERY
TIME
I
MEET
A
CHRISTIAN
OR
FOR
THAT
MATTER
ANY
OTHER
THEIST
WHO
TRIES
TO
CONVERT
ME
I
FIND
THIS
PROVEN
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
I
SEE
NO
WISDOM
WHATSOEVER
IN
YOUR
WORDS
UNFAITHFULLY
YOURS
PIXIE
PS
IF
YOU
DO
SINCERELY
BELIEVE
THAT
A
GOD
EXISTS
WHY
DO
YOU
FOLLOW
IT
BLINDLY
DO
THE
WORDS
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
MEAN
ANYTHING
TO
YOU
I
DEFY
ANY
THEIST
TO
REPLY
