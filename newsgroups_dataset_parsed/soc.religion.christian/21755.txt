i
also
dont
see
the
necessity
of
saying
the
holy
parents
were
some
how
sanctified
beyond
normal
humanity
it
sounds
like
our
own
inability
to
grasp
the
immensity
of
gods
grace
in
being
incarnated
through
an
or
dinary
human
being
when
elizabeth
greeted
mary
elizabeth
said
something
to
the
effect
that
mary
out
of
all
women
was
blessed
if
so
it
appears
that
this
exactly
places
mary
beyond
whoa
dude
i
dont
see
the
jump
you
made
she
was
blessed
ill
give
you
that
much
what
do
you
mean
she
was
placed
beyond
the
sanctification
of
normal
humanity
