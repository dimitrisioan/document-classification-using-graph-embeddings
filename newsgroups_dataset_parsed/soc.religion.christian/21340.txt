WHY
DO
PEOPLE
BECOME
ATHEISTS

THAT
A

THEYVE
BELIEVED
IN
IS

WORDS
TOO
SMALL
IF
A
PERSONS
UNDERSTANDING
OF
GOD
IS
NOT
ALLOWED
TO

WHO
WAS
A
COMFORTING
IMAGE
IN
CHILDHOOD
BECOMES
A

A
THERAPIST
FRIEND
OF
MINE
SOMETIMES
SUGGESTS
TO
HER
CLIENTS
THAT
THEY
FIRE
GOD
WHAT
SHE
MEANS
BY
THAT
IS
LETTING
GO
OF
AN
INADEQUATE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
GOD
TO
MAKE
ROOM
FOR
A
FULLER
ONE
BUT
SHE
FOLLOWS
UP
BY
ENCOURAGING
THEM
TO
HIRE
A
NEW
ONE
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
A
LOT
OF
FOLKS
GO
THROUGH
THE
FIRING
PROCESS
BUT
ARE
NOT
ADEQUATELY
SUPPORTED
IN
THE
