I
THINK
WROTE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
THE
SUGGESTION
THAT
GENOCIDE
MAY
SOMETIMES
BE
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
ANY
GOD
WHO
WORKS
THAT
WAY
IS
INDESCRIBABLY
EVIL
AND
UNWORTHY

WORSHIP

NOBUYA

REPLIED
AS
IN
SUBSTANCE
DID
OTHERS
WHERE
IS
YOUR
SOURCE
OF
MORAL
STANDARDS
BY
WHICH
YOU
JUDGE
GODS
BEHAVIOR
IT
IS
OFTEN
ARGUED
THAT
WE
HAVE
NO
STANDING
BY
WHICH
TO
JUDGE
GODS
ACTIONS
WHO
IS
THE
CLAY
TO
TALK
BACK
TO
THE
POTTER
BUT
WE
FIND
A
CONTRARY
VIEW
IN
SCRIPTURE
WHEN
GOD
PROPOSES
TO
DESTROY
THE
CITY
OF
SODOM
GENESIS
ABRAHAM
SAYS
SUPPOSE
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
GOOD
MEN
IN
THE
CITY
WILL
YOU
DESTROY
THE
RIGHTEOUS
ALONG
WITH
THE
WICKED
FAR
BE
IT
FROM
YOU
LORD
TO
DO
SUCH
A
THING
SHALL
NOT
THE
JUDGE
OF
ALL
THE
EARTH
DO
RIGHT
I
AM
TOLD
THAT
THE
HEBREW
IS
ACTUALLY
A
BIT
STRONGER
THAN
THIS
AND
CAN
PERHAPS
BE
BETTER
RENDERED
DYNAMIC
EQUIVALENCE
AS
SHAME
ON
YOU
LORD
IF
YOU
DO
SUCH
A
THING
THERE
ARE
THOSE
WHO
SAY
THAT
THE
DEFINITION
OF
GOOD
IS
WHATEVER
GOD
HAPPENS
TO
WANT
BUT
IF
THAT
IS
SO
THEN
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
GOD
IS
GOOD
HAS
NO
MEANING
IT
SIMPLY
SAYS
THAT
GOD
DOES
WHAT
HE
WANTS
THAT
BEING
THE
CASE
NO
ONE
CAN
EITHER
LOVE
OR
OBEY
GOD
BECAUSE
HE
IS
GOOD
THE
ONLY
MOTIVE
LEFT
FOR
OBEYING
HIM
IS
THAT
HE
IS
POWERFUL
JUST
AS
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
OBEY
A
DICTATOR
EVEN
WHEN
HE
TELLS
YOU
TO
ROUND
UP
ALL
JEWS
AND
EXTERMINATE
THEM
BECAUSE
IF
YOU
DEFY
HIM
YOU
MIGHT
END
UP
IN
THE
GAS
CHAMBER
YOURSELF
SO
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
OBEY
GOD
BECAUSE
HE
HAS
THE
POWER
TO
PUNISH
YOU
IF
YOU
DONT
THIS
ETHICAL
THEORY
I
TAKE
TO
BE
IN
RADICAL
CONTRADICTION
TO
GENESIS
AND
TO
CHRISTIANITY
IN
GENERAL
ANY
THEORY
THAT
MAKES
OUR
MORAL
JUDGEMENTS
WORTHLESS
MAKES
ANY
FURTHER
DISCUSSION
OF
MORALITY
OR
OF
THE
GOODNESS
OF
GOD
MEANINGLESS
HOWEVER
IT
DOES
NOT
FOLLOW
THAT
OUR
MORAL
JUDGEMENTS
ARE
ALWAYS
INFALLIBLE
IN
PARTICULAR
CASES
STILL
LESS
OUR
JUDGEMENTS
IN
PARTICULAR
CASES
ABOUT
THE
COURSE
OF
ACTION
MOST
LIKELY
TO
ACHIEVE
A
GOOD
RESULT
WHEN
I
READ
THE
SCRIPTURAL
ACCOUNTS
OF
THE
ACTIONS
OF
GOD
IN
HISTORY
THOSE
ACTIONS
OFTEN
SEEM
TO
ME
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
WHAT
I
MIGHT
EXPECT
OF
A
GOD
WHO
LOVES
US
AND
DESIRES
WHAT
IS
BEST
FOR
US
MOREOVER
LEAVING
THE
SCRIPTURES
ASIDE
AND
CONSIDERING
THE
NATURAL
WORLD
I
FIND
THAT
NATURE
IS
OFTEN
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
WHAT
I
MIGHT
EXPECT
IF
IT
WERE
THE
WORK
OF
A
BENEVOLENT
DEITY
ORIGEN
SAID
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
AUTHOR
OF
NATURE
IS
ALSO
THE
AUTHOR
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
MUST
EXPECT
TO
FIND
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
DIFFICULTIES
THAT
THEY
FIND
IN
NATURE
NOW
THAT
SOME
SUCH
DIFFICULTIES
SHOULD
EXIST
IS
NOT
IN
ITSELF
AN
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
THE
EXISTENCE
POWER
WISDOM
AND
GOODNESS
OF
GOD
ON
THE
CONTRARY
THEIR
ABSENCE
WOULD
BE
SUCH
AN
ARGUMENT
SUPPOSE
THAT
I
AM
WATCHING
BOBBY
FISHER
PLAY
CHESS
AND
SUPPOSE
THAT
EVERY
TIME
HE
MAKES
A
MOVE
I
FIND
MYSELF
NODDING
AND
SAYING
GOOD
MOVE
JUST
WHAT
I
WAS
EXPECTING
HIM
TO
DO
SAME
MOVE
I
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
IF
I
WERE
PLAYING
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
SIGN
THAT
FISHER
IS
NO
BETTER
A
CHESS
PLAYER
THAN
MYSELF
GIVEN
THAT
HE
IS
BETTER
I
EXPECT
THAT
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
HIS
MOVES
WILL
HAVE
ME
THINKING
NOW
WHAT
DO
SUPPOSE
INDUCED
HIM
TO
DO
THAT
OR
EVEN
BOY
THAT
WAS
A
REAL
SLIP
HES
JUST
THROWN
THE
GAME
AWAY
SIMILARLY
IF
GOD
UNDERSTANDS
THE
WORKINGS
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
BETTER
THAN
I
DO
IT
IS
TO
BE
EXPECTED
THAT
SOMETIMES
IT
WILL
LOOK
TO
ME
AS
IF
HE
HAS
MADE
A
MISTAKE
ONE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
FISHER
AT
THE
CHESSBOARD
AND
GOD
AT
THE
CONTROLS
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
IS
THAT
I
CAN
SEE
THE
END
OF
THE
CHESS
GAME
IF
FISHER
WINS
I
REVISE
MY
EARLIER
INFERENCE
THAT
IT
WAS
CARELESSNESS
THAT
MADE
HIM
LOSE
HIS
QUEEN
MOVES
EARLIER
HOWEVER
IF
HE
LOSES
AND
PARTICULARLY
IF
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
TIME
WHEN
HE
HAD
AN
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
A
CHECKMATE
IN
TWO
MOVES
AND
DID
NOT
TAKE
IT
THEN
I
KNOW
THAT
HE
IS
NOT
AS
GOOD
A
PLAYER
AS
I
HAD
THOUGHT
WITH
GOD
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
SHALL
NOT
IN
THIS
LIFE
SEE
THE
TOTAL
RESULT
OF
SOME
OF
HIS
ACTIONS
THEREFORE
MY
GROUNDS
FOR
JUDGING
THAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
BAD
MOVE
ON
HIS
PART
MUST
ALWAYS
BE
FAR
SHAKIER
THAN
MY
GROUNDS
FOR
MAKING
A
SIMILAR
JUDGEMENT
ABOUT
FISHER
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
GENESIS
WE
READ
THAT
JOSEPHS
TEN
OLDER
BROTHERS
WHO
WITH
GOOD
REASON
FOUND
HIM
INSUFFERABLE
CONSPIRED
TO
SELL
HIM
INTO
SLAVERY
IN
EGYPT
THERE
HE
EVENTUALLY
BECAME
VICEROY
AND
WHEN
THERE
WAS
A
FAMINE
IN
CANAAN
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
PROVIDE
FOR
HIS
FAMILY
WHEN
HIS
BROTHERS
NERVOUSLY
APOLOGIZED
HE
TOLD
THEM
DO
NOT
WORRY
YOU
MEANT
TO
DO
ME
EVIL
BUT
GOD
TURNED
IT
INTO
GOOD
I
ONCE
HEARD
A
RABBI
SPEAK
ON
THIS
TEXT
HE
SAID
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
JEWS
IS
LARGELY
A
HISTORY
OF
EVENTS
THAT
LOOK
LIKE
CATASTROPHES
THAT
THREATEN
THE
CONTINUED
SURVIVAL
OF
THE
RELIGION
OR
THE
PEOPLE
OR
BOTH
BUT
AMAZINGLY
THOSE
EVENTS
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
THE
SAVING
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
OF
JUDAISM
THE
SALE
OF
JOSEPH
BY
HIS
BROTHERS
LOOKED
LIKE
THE
BREAKUP
OF
THE
FAMILY
BUT
IN
FACT
IT
ENDED
WITH
A
RECONCILIATION
OF
THE
QUARREL
BETWEEN
THEM
THE
FAMINE
THAT
DROVE
THE
FAMILY
OUT
OF
CANAAN
LOOKED
LIKE
A
MISFORTUNE
FOR
THEM
BUT
IN
FACT
IF
THEY
HAD
STAYED
IN
CANAAN
THEY
WOULD
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
HAVE
INTERMARRIED
WITH
THE
CANAANITES
AND
BEEN
ASSIMILATED
INTO
THEIR
CULTURE
THEIR
OPPRESSION
BY
THE
EGYPTIANS
A
FEW
GENERATIONS
AFTER
THEIR
ARRIVAL
IN
EGYPT
AGAIN
LOOKED
LIKE
A
DISASTER
BUT
GOD
USED
IT
TO
BRING
THEM
OUT
OF
EGYPT
AND
INTO
THE
PROMISED
LAND
HERE
THE
PEOPLE
BUILT
A
TEMPLE
AND
REGULARLY
OFFERED
SACRIFICES
BUT
THE
BABYLONIANS
CAPTURED
JERUSALEM
AND
JUDEA
DESTROYED
TEMPLE
AND
CITY
AND
COUNTRYSIDE
AND
DEPORTED
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
TO
BABYLON
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
THAT
WOULD
BE
THE
END
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AND
THE
RELIGION
BUT
IT
WAS
NOT
LIVING
IN
CANAAN
THE
PEOPLE
HAD
BEEN
UNDER
CONSTANT
DANGER
OF
ASSIMILATION
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN
THEY
HAD
TURNED
FROM
THE
WORSHIP
OF
THE
LORD
TO
THE
WORSHIP
OF
THE
CANAANITE
FERTILITY
CULTS
WITH
THEIR
RITUAL
PROSTITUTION
AND
RITUAL
HUMAN
SACRIFICE
THE
BABYLONIAN
CAPTIVITY
PUT
A
STOP
TO
THAT
NEVER
AGAIN
DID
THE
JEWS
SHOW
ANY
INTEREST
IN
POLYTHEISM
OR
IDOLATRY
NEITHER
THE
WORSHIP
OF
THE
CANAANITES
MOR
THAT
OF
THE
BABYLONIANS
EVER
AGAIN
HAD
A
FOOTHOLD
AMONG
THEM
NOR
IS
THAT
ALL
JUDAISM
HAD
BEEN
IN
DANGER
OF
BECOMING
SIMPLY
A
SYSTEM
OF
SACRIFICES
AND
TEMPLE
OBSERVANCES
THE
ONLY
PRESCRIBED
ACTS
OF
WORSHIP
CONSISTED
OF
COMING
TO
JERUSALEM
EVERY
SO
OFTEN
AND
OFFERING
A
SACRIFICE
DURING
THE
CAPTIVITY
WITH
THE
TEMPLE
GONE
THE
JEWS
INVENTED
THE
SYNAGOGUE
A
PLACE
OF
MEETING
FOR
READING
AND
STUDY
AND
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
THEY
CAME
TO
REALIZE
CLEARLY
WHAT
THEY
WERE
IN
DANGER
OF
FORGETTING
WHILE
THEY
CONTINUED
TO
LIVE
IN
JUDEA
THAT
GOD
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
A
LOCAL
OR
TRIBAL
DEITY
NOT
JUST
THE
CONTROLLER
OF
THE
LAND
OF
CANAAN
OR
THE
PATRON
OF
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
BUT
THE
CREATOR
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
THE
RULER
AND
JUDGE
OF
ALL
HUMANS
EVERYWHERE
TIME
PASSED
AND
THE
BABYLONIAN
EMPIRE
WAS
REPLACED
BY
THAT
OF
THE
PERSIANS
AND
THEN
THAT
OF
THE
GREEKS
OR
RATHER
THE
MACEDONIANS
THE
RULER
ANTIOCHUS
EPIPHANES
WAS
DETERMINED
TO
STAMP
OUT
JUDAISM
AND
TO
THIS
END
HE
MADE
THE
READING
AND
THE
STUDY
OF
THE
TORAH
PUNISHABLE
BY
DEATH
AGAIN
ONE
MIGHT
THINK
THAT
THIS
WOULD
BE
THE
END
OF
JUDAISM
BUT
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
MET
FOR
WORSHIP
AND
INSTEAD
OF
READING
THE
TORAH
PORTION
APPOINTED
FOR
THE
DAY
THEY
WOULD
READ
SOME
PASSAGE
FROM
THE
PROPHETS
THAT
HAD
A
SIMILAR
THEME
AND
THEN
DISCUSS
THAT
BEFORE
THIS
TIME
THE
TORAH
THE
SOCALLED
FIVE
BOOKS
OF
MOSES
GENESIS
EXODUS
LEVITICUS
NUMBERS
AND
DEUTERONOMY
WERE
THE
ONLY
BOOKS
READ
AND
STUDIED
IN
THE
SYNAGOGUE
IF
IT
HAD
NOT
BEEN
FOR
ANTIOCHUS
THE
BOOKS
OF
THE
PROPHETS
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
BEEN
FORGOTTEN
ALTOGETHER
HIS
HATRED
FOR
JUDAISM
SAVED
THEM
OTHER
EXAMPLES
HERE
OMITTED
FOR
BREVITYS
SAKE
SOME
OF
YOU
MAY
REMEMBER
THAT
JULIE
ANDREWS
FIRST
BECAME
FAMOUS
AS
ELIZA
DOOLITTLE
IN
THE
STAGE
PRODUCTION
OF
MY
FAIR
LADY
WHEN
WARNER
BROTHERS
UNDERTOOK
TO
MAKE
A
MOVIE
OF
IT
EVERYONE
EXPECTED
THAT
JULIE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
SO
MAGNIFICENT
ON
STAGE
WOULD
PLAY
THE
SAME
ROLE
IN
THE
MOVIE
INSTEAD
THE
STUDIO
DECIDED
TO
GO
WITH
AN
ESTABLISHED
SCREEN
STAR
AND
CAST
AUDREY
HEPBURN
JULIE
ANDREWS
WAS
NATURALLY
CRUSHED
BUT
SHE
LATER
REALIZED
THAT
IF
SHE
HAD
PLAYED
THE
SCREEN
ROLE
SHE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TYPECAST
FOR
LIFE
AS
AN
ELIZE
DOOLITTLE
TYPE
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
DISASTER
FOR
HER
AS
IT
WAS
WALT
DISNEY
OFFERED
HER
THE
ROLE
OF
MARY
POPPINS
AND
SHE
WON
AN
OSCAR
FOR
IT
AT
THE
PRESENTATION
SHE
STOOD
THERE
SMILING
AND
LOOKING
AT
WALT
DISNEY
SHE
SAID
AND
NOW
MY
SPECIAL
THANKS
TO
THE
MAN
WHO
MADE
ALL
THIS
POSSIBLE
JACK
WARNER
IT
WAS
THE
MOST
MEMORABLE
LINE
OF
THE
EVENING
IN
A
SIMILAR
SPIRIT
WE
JEWS
MIGHT
THANK
THE
MEN
WHO
IN
THE
PROVIDENCE
OF
GOD
HAVE
PRESERVED
JUDAISM
AND
KEPT
IT
ALIVE
TO
THIS
DAY
BEGINNING
WITH
JOSEPHS
BROTHERS
AND
CONTINUING
WITH
TWO
PHARAOHS
WITH
NEBUCHADNEZZAR
WITH
ANTIOCHUS
EPIPHANES
AFTER
THE
FORMAL
MEETING
HAD
BROKEN
UP
ONE
WOMAN
CAME
UP
TO
HIM
PRIVATELY
AND
SAID
YOU
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
HOLOCAUST
WERENT
YOU
HE
ANSWERED
IF
THAT
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
THAT
CAME
TO
YOUR
MIND
THEN
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
I
WAS
TALKING
ABOUT
IT
TO
YOU
BUT
I
WOULD
NOT
TALK
ABOUT
IT
TO
EVERYONE
FOR
NOT
EVERYONE
CAN
BEAR
IT
I
ASSUME
THAT
HE
MEANT
THAT
WITHOUT
THE
HOLOCAUST
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NO
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
SOMEONE
HEARING
THE
RABBIS
LECTURE
MIGHT
LEAP
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
GOD
IS
DEPENDENT
ON
THE
WICKEDNESS
OF
MEN
TO
ACCOMPLISH
HIS
PURPOSES
OR
AT
LEAST
THAT
THE
RABBI
THOUGHT
SO
HE
MIGHT
THEN
GO
ON
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
WICKEDNESS
IS
IN
FACT
GODS
DOING
THAT
HE
STIRRED
UP
JOSEPHS
BROTHERS
TO
A
MURDEROUS
HATE
AGAINST
HIM
AND
THAT
WHEN
THE
ISRAELITES
WERE
IN
EGYPT
GOD
HARDENED
PHARAOHS
HEART
SO
THAT
HE
OPPRESSED
THE
PEOPLE
AND
WOULD
NOT
LET
THEM
GO
AND
THIS
RAISES
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
HOW
AN
ACTION
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
WICKED
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
BE
CONSIDERED
SOMETHING
THAT
GOD
HAS
BROUGHT
ABOUT
I
SUGGEST
ANOTHER
WAY
OF
LOOKING
AT
IT
CONSIDER
A
SCULPTOR
WHO
HAS
A
LOG
OF
WOOD
FROM
WHICH
HE
PROPOSES
TO
CARVE
A
STATUE
BUT
THE
LOG
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
A
SMOOTH
EVEN
GRAIN
THROUGHOUT
HAS
A
LARGE
KNOT
THAT
SPOILS
THE
APPEARANCE
OF
THE
SURFACE
THE
SCULPTOR
CONSIDERS
THE
WOOD
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
THEN
CARVES
A
STATUE
THAT
FEATURES
THE
KNOT
THAT
MAKES
THAT
PARTICULAR
INTERRUPTION
IN
THE
GRAIN
AND
COLOR
OF
THE
WOOD
CORRESPOND
TO
SOME
FEATURE
OF
THE
STATUE
SO
THAT
OBSERVERS
WILL
SAY
HOW
FORTUNATE
THE
SCULPTOR
WAS
IN
FINDING
A
PIECE
OF
WOOD
WITH
A
KNOT
LIKE
THAT
IN
JUST
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
ITS
PRESENCE
IS
THE
CROWNING
TOUCH
THE
THING
THAT
MAKES
THE
STATUE
A
GREAT
WORK
OF
ART
IN
REALITY
THE
KNOT
FAR
FROM
BEING
WHAT
THE
SCULPTOR
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
WAS
A
CHALLENGE
TO
HIS
SKILL
IF
THE
WOOD
HAD
NOT
CONTAINED
THAT
FLAW
HE
WOULD
STILL
HAVE
MADE
A
GREAT
WORK
OF
ART
BUT
A
DIFFERENT
ONE
SO
IF
JOSEPHS
BROTHERS
HAD
NOT
SOLD
HIM
GOD
WOULD
STILL
HAVE
BROUGHT
ABOUT
HIS
PURPOSES
FOR
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
BUT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
SO
IN
ANOTHER
MANNER
IF
JUDAS
HAD
NOT
BETRAYED
JESUS
IF
CAIAPHAS
AND
HIS
FELLOW
LEADERS
HAD
NOT
REJECTED
JESUS
BUT
HAD
RATHER
ACKNOWLEDGED
HIM
AS
THE
ANNOINTED
OF
GOD
IF
PILATE
HAD
FOLLOWED
HIS
CONSCIENCE
RATHER
THAN
HIS
FEARS
AND
HAD
SET
JESUS
FREE
IT
MIGHT
APPEAR
THAT
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NO
CRUCIFIXION
AND
THEREFORE
NO
REDEMPTION
AND
THEREFORE
NO
SALVATION
NOT
SO
GOD
DID
NOT
NEED
JUDAS
SIN
TO
REDEEM
US
IF
JUDAS
HAD
DONE
RIGHT
THEN
GOD
IN
CHRIST
WOULD
STILL
HAVE
RECONCILED
THE
WORLD
TO
HIMSELF
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
JUST
AS
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
MICHELANGELO
WOULD
HAVE
PAINTED
THE
SISTINE
CHAPEL
IF
ITS
INTERIOR
HAD
INSTEAD
BEEN
SHAPED
LIKE
GRAND
CENTRAL
STATION
AND
JUST
AS
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
BOBBY
FISHER
WOULD
HAVE
WON
HIS
FOURTH
GAME
AGIANST
SPASSKY
IF
SPASSKY
HAD
REFUSED
THE
EXCHANGE
OF
BISHOPS
AND
HAD
ATTACKED
FISHERS
KNIGHT
INSTEAD
DONT
BOTHER
TO
LOOK
UP
THE
GAME
IN
QUESTIONI
AM
MAKING
UP
THIS
EXAMPLE
BUT
THE
POINT
IS
NONE
THE
LESS
VALID
THUS
WE
MAY
SAY
BOTH
THAT
GOD
USED
SAY
THE
COWARDICE
OF
PILATE
TO
ACCOMPLISH
HIS
PURPOSES
AND
THAT
THE
SAID
COWARDICE
WAS
NOT
GODS
DOING
AND
THAT
PILATE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
THWARTED
GODS
PLANS
BY
BEHAVING
JUSTLY
AND
COURAGEOUSLY
WHAT
THEN
ARE
WE
TO
MAKE
OF
THE
PLACE
WHERE
GOD
SAYS
TO
MOSES
I
WILL
HARDEN
PHARAOHS
HEART
SO
THAT
HE
WILL
NOT
LET
THE
PEOPLE
GO
SOME
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
TAKEN
THIS
TO
MEAN
THAT
PHARAOH
WAS
A
PUPPET
WITH
GOD
PULLING
THE
STRINGS
AND
THAT
HIS
STUBBORNNESS
AND
CRUELTY
WERE
NOT
HIS
OWN
WORK
BUT
THE
WORK
OF
GOD
IN
HIM
I
SUPPOSE
RATHER
THAT
WHAT
GOD
WAS
TELLING
MOSES
WAS
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
IF
YOU
SEE
THAT
PHARAOH
IS
NOT
WILLING
TO
LET
THE
PEOPLE
GO
DO
NOT
BE
DISCOURAGED
OR
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
SITUATION
IS
OUT
OF
MY
CONTROL
MY
PURPOSES
WILL
NOT
BE
THWARTED
IF
PHARAOH
CHOOSES
TO
HEAR
YOU
AND
LET
THE
PEOPLE
GO
WELL
AND
GOOD
IF
HE
DOES
NOT
I
WILL
FIT
HIS
RESISTANCE
INTO
MY
PLANS
AND
FIT
IT
SO
PERFECTLY
THAT
FUTURE
HISTORIANS
AND
THEOLOGIANS
WILL
SUPPOSE
THAT
I
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THROWN
FOR
A
LOSS
IF
PHARAOH
HAD
OBEYED
ME
TO
RETURN
TO
THE
QUESTION
THAT
STARTED
THIS
ALL
OFF
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
SERBS
IN
SLAUGHTERING
THE
MOSLEMS
OF
BOSNIA
ARE
INSTRUMENTS
OF
GODS
WILL
FIRST
POINT
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
IS
WRONG
JUST
AS
WHAT
JOSEPHS
BROTHERS
DID
WAS
WRONG
JUST
AS
WHAT
JUDAS
DID
WAS
WRONG
THEY
INTEND
IT
FOR
EVIL
IF
GOD
SOMEHOW
BRINGS
GOOD
OUT
OF
IT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
THEM
ANY
LESS
SUBJECT
TO
JUST
CONDEMNATION
AND
PUNISHMENT
SECOND
POINT
OF
COURSE
GOD
WILL
BRING
GOOD
OUT
OF
IT
BUT
NOT
THE
SAME
GOOD
THAT
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BROUGHT
IF
THE
