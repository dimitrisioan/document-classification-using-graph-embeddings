JOHN

WRITES
IT
SEEMS
I
SPEND
A
SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT
OF
MY
TIME
CORRECTING
ERRORS
ABOUT
THE
RELIABILITY
TESTS
FOR
CONDOMS
AND
ABSTINENCE
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
I
SAW
THAT
FAMOUS
STUDY
THAT
SHOWED
A
FAILURE
RATE
FOR
CONDOMS
THE
SAME
STUDY
SHOWED
A
FAILURE
RATE
FOR
ABSTINENCE
THAT
IS
ADULT
COUPLES
WHO
RELIED
ON
ABSTINENCE
TO
PREVENT
PREGNANCY
GOT
PREGNANT
IN
ALARMING
NUMBERSTHEY
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
WILLPOWER
TO
ABSTAIN
AND
WERE
THINKING
THAT
THIS
WILL
WORK
WITH
HIGH
SCHOOL
KIDS
I
AM
TOLD
THAT
PLANNED
PARENTHOODSIECUSSTYLE
VALUESFREE
METHODS
THAT
TEACH
CONTRACEPTIVE
TECHNOLOGY
AND
ADVISE
KIDS
HOW
TO
MAKE
CHOICES
ACTUALLY
INCREASE
PREGNANCY
RATES
I
POSTED
A
LONG
ARTICLE
ON
THIS
A
WHILE
BACK
AND
WILL
BE
HAPPY
TO
EMAIL
A
COPY
TO
ANY
WHO
ARE
INTERESTED
THE

INCLUDED
SOURCES
TO
CONTACT
FOR
INFORMATION
ON
RESEARCH
VERIFYING
THESE
STATEMENTS
AND
AN
OUTSTANDING
SOURCE
FOR
INFO
ON
ACQUIRING
ABSTINENCERELATED
CURRICULA
EVEN
IN
SINGLECOPY
QUANTITIES
FOR
HOME
USE
THE
SAME
RESEARCH
PRODUCED
THE
RESULTS
THAT
ABSTINENCERELATED
CURRICULA
WERE
FOUND
TO
DECREASE
PREGNANCY
RATES
IN
TEENS
I
ASSUME
THAT
IT
IS
REASONABLE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THE
AIDS
RATE
WILL
FLUCTUATE
WITH
THE
PREGNANCY
RATE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
NOT
IN
CONTRACEPTIVE
TECHNOLOGY
BUT
IN
THE
VALUES
TAUGHT
TO
THE
CHILDREN
THE
PPSIECUS
CURRICULA
TAUGHT
THE
KIDS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
LEGITIMATE
CHOICES
WHILE
THE
ABSTINENCE
RELATED
CURRICULA
TAUGHT
THEM
THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
HAVE
LEGITIMATE
CHOICES
OTHER
THAN
ABSTINENCE
IT
IS
THE
VALUES
SYSTEM
THAT
IS
THE
STRONGEST
DETERMINENT
OF
THE
BEHAVIOR
BEHAVIOR
OF
THESE
KIDS
DESPITE
THE
BETTER
TRACK
RECORD
OF
ABSTINENCERELATED
CURRICULA
THEY
ARE
SUPPRESSED
IN
FAVOR
OF
CURRICULA
THAT
PRODUCE
AN
EFFECT
CONTRARY
TO
THAT
DESIRED
QUESTION
FOR
FURTHER
DISCUSSION
AS
THEY
SAY
IN
THE
TEXTBOOKS
WHY
DONT
WE
TEACH
SAFE
DRUG
USE
TO
KIDS
INSTEAD
OF
DRUG
ABSTINENCE
ISNT
IT
BECAUSE
WE
KNOW
THAT
A
CLASS
IN
HOW
TO
USE
DRUGS
SAFELY
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
TO
USE
DRUGS
WOULD
INCREASE
DRUG
USE
WHY
ISNT
DRUG
ABSTINENCE
EDUCATION
BARRED
FROM
SCHOOLS
BECAUSE
IT
TEACHES
RELIGION
ARENT
WE
ABANDONING
THOSE
CHILDREN
WHO
WILL
USE
DRUGS
ANYWAY
AND
NEED
INSTRUCTION
IN
THEIR
SAFE
USE
