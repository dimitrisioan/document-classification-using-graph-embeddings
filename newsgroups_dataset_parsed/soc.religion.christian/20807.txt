id
be
fascinated
to
see
such
evidence
please
send
me
your
article
on
the
negative
side
however
i
suspect
that
any
such
simplistic
link
abstinenceeducation
decreased
pregnancy
contraceptiveeducation
increased
pregnancy
is
false
the
us
which
id
guess
has
one
of
the
largest
proportion
of
nonliberal
sex
education
in
the
western
world
also
has
one
of
the
highest
teenage
pregnancy
rates
please
correct
me
if
my
guess
is
wrong
ive
sent
the
article
in
terms
of
the
group
discussion
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
nonliberal
education
head
in
the
sand
is
not
the
same
as
abstinence
education
we
had
nonliberal
education
regarding
drugs
when
i
was
a
kid
in
the
which
didnt
do
us
a
lot
of
good
but
abstinence
education
regarding
drugs
has
proven
effective
i
