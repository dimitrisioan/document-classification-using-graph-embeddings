ERIC
MOLAS
WRITES
I
WAS
RAISED
IN
A
RELIGIOUS
ATMOSPHERE
AND
ATTENDED
YEARS
OF
RELIGIOUS
EDUCATIONAL
INSTITUTIONS
I
KNOW
THE
BIBLE
WELL
SO
WELL
I
CAN
RECOGNIZE
MANY
PASSAGES
FROM
MEMORY
STUFF
DELETED
FOR
BREVITY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
AN
INFECTIOUS
CULT
THE
REASONS
IT
FLOURISHES
ARE
BECAUSE
IT
GIVES
PEOPLE
WITHOUT
HOPE
OR
DRIVEN
PURPOSE
IN
LIFE
A
SAFETY
BLANKED
TO
HIDE
BEHIND
OH
WOWALL
I
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
FOLLOW
THIS
CHRISTIAN
MORAL
STANDARD
AND
I
GET
ETERNAL
HAPPINESS
FOR
ALL
OF
YOU
FOUND
JEEZUS
HOW
MANY
OF
YOU
WERE
ON
THE
BRINK
YOUR
VERY
STARTING
POINT
IS
WRONG
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOT
BASED
ON
FOLLOWING
A
MORAL
STANDARD
FOR
IT
IS
BY
GRACE
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
SAVED
THROUGH
FAITH
NOT
BY
WORKS
SO
THAT
NO
MAN
MAY
BOAST
EPH
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
KNOW
THE
BIBLE
WELL
AND
CAN
RECOGNIZE
DO
YOU
MEAN
RECITE
MANY
PASSAGES
FROM
MEMORY
THAT
COULD
VERY
WELL
BE
SO
HOWEVER
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
MORE
PASSAGES
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
TITUS
AND
JAMES
ARE
AMONG
THEM
OBEDIENCE
TO
THE
MORAL
LAW
IS
IMPORANT
HOWEVER
IT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THE
RESULT
OF
TURNING
YOUR
LIFE
OVER
TO
CHRIST
AND
BECOMING
A
CHRISTIAN
IT
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
THE
STARTING
