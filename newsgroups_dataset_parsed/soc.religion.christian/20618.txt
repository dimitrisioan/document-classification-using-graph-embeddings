ERIC
MOLAS
WRITES
FIRSTLY
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
I
AM
NOT
POSTING
HERE
AS
AN
IMMATURE
FLAME
START
BUT
RATHER
TO
EXPRESS
AN
OPINION
TO
MY
INTENDED
AUDIENCE
DELETED
WE
ARE
JUST
ANIMALS
WE
NEED
SLEEP
FOOD
AND
WE
REPRODUCE
AND
WE
DIE
I
DONT
MEANT
TO
DEFEND
ERIC
MOLAS
I
FIND
IT
SOMEWHAT
ANNOYING
WHEN
SOMEONE
POPS
UP
ON
ALTATHEISM
TO
TELL
US
ALL
ABOUT
HIS
USUALLY
ATHEISTIC
BELIEFS
SO
I
CAN
CERTAINLY
SEE
HOW
CHRISTIANS
MIGHT
BE
ANNOYED
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
A
FEW
THINGS
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
I
AM
NOT
AN
ATHEIST
IT
SEEMS
TRAGIC
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
CHOOSE
A
MEANINGLESS
EXISTENCE
NO
MEANING
FROM
GOD
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
NO
MEANING
FROM
MY
ATHEISTIC
POINT
OF
VIEW
IF
YOU
WANT
MEANING
IN
YOUR
LIFE
YOU
GET
TO
GO
AND
GET
SOME
OR
MAKE
SOME
NO
FREE
GIFTS
OF
MEANING
I
NEVER
QUITE
UNDERSTOOD
HOW
ANY
GOD
CAN
JUST
GIVE
YOUR
LIFE
MEANING
ACTUALLY
IF
HE
SAYS
YOU
EXISTS
TO
DO
OR
BE
X
THAT
GIVES
YOU
A
PURPOSE
IF
YOU
CARE
TO
ACCEPT
IT
BUT
IS
THAT
THE
SAME
THING
BUT
I
DIGRESS
HOW
TERRIBLE
TO
GO
ON
LIVING
ONLY
BECAUSE
ONE
FEARS
DEATH
MORE
THAN
LIFE
THIS
WOULD
TRUELY
BE
A
MISERABLY
EXISTANCE
WHICH
I
DOUBT
ERIC
ENDURES
LIFE
CAN
BE
ENJOYABLE
SO
YOU
CAN
LIVE
IT
BECAUSE
YOU
LIKE
IT
OR
PURPOSEFULL
SO
YOU
CAN
LIVE
IT
TO
GET
SOMETHING
DONE
ONE
SHOULD
ENDEAVOUR
TO
MAKE
IT
SO
IF
IT
IS
NOT
OTHERWISE
IT
WOULD
BE
AS
YOU
SAY
TERRIBLE
I
FEEL
SO
SORRY
FOR
ERIC
AND
YET
ANY
ATTEMPTS
TO
SHARE
MY
JOY
IN
LIFE
WITH
HIM
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
AS
FURTHER
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
INFECTIOUS
NATURE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
PROBABLY
TRUE
REMEBER
HE
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
SEES
THAT
PARTICULAR
JOY
AS
AN
ILLUSION
AND
DOES
NOT
WANT
IT
SO
MAYBE
IT
ISNT
SO
BAD
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
I
AM
FREE
TO
BE
A
HUMAN
PERSON
I
THINK
LOVE
CHOOSE
AND
CREATE
AS
AN
ATHEIST
I
AM
FREE
TO
BE
A
HUMAN
PERSON
I
THINK
LOVE
CHOOSE
AND
CREATE
I
WILL
LIVE
FOREVER
WITH
GOD
AH
NOW
HERE
WE
BEGIN
TO
DIVERGE
I
WILL
NOT
LIVE
FOREVER
WITH
ANYONE
I
DONT
THINK
YOU
WILL
EITHER
BUT
YOU
ARE
WELCOME
TO
YOUR
OPINION
ON
THE
MATTER
CHRIST
IS
NOT
A
KIND
OF
DRUG
I
TEND
TO
AGREE
WITH
YOU
ITS
MY
OPINION
THAT
UNLIKE
DRUGS
RELIGIONS
ARE
NORMAL
PARTS
OF
HUMAN
SOCIETIES
I
THINK
THEY
HAVE
OUTLIVED
THEIR
USEFULLNESS
BUT
THEY
ARE
EVIDENTLY
QUITE
ORDINARY
NORMAL
THINGS
THAT
HAVENT
PROVED
LETHAL
TO
HUMANITY
YET
DRUGS
ARE
A
REPLACEMENT
FOR
CHRIST
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
AN
EMPTY
SPOT
IN
THE
GODSHAPED
HOLE
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
MUST
DO
SOMETHING
TO
EASE
THE
PAIN
I
HAVE
HEARD
THIS
CLAIM
QUITE
A
FEW
TIMES
DOES
ANYBODY
HERE
KNOW
WHO
FIRST
CAME
UP
WITH
THE
GODSHAPED
HOLE
BUSINESS
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
MOST
EFFECTIVE
SUBSTANCEABUSE
RECOVERY
PROGRAMS
INVOLVE
MEETING
PEOPLES
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
PROVIDE
SOME
EVIDENCE
NEXT
TIME
YOU
MAKE
A
CLAIM
LIKE
THIS
THANK
YOU
ERIC
FOR
YOUR
POST
IT
HAS
HELPED
ME
TO
APPRECIATE
HOW
MUCH
GOD
HAS
BLESSED
ME
I
HOPE
THAT
YOU
WILL
SOMEDAY
HAVE
A
MORE
JOYFILLED
AND
ABUNDANT
LIFE
I
DONT
KNOW
ERIC
BUT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
IT
IS
WISE
TO
ASSUME
HE
HAS
A
LESS
JOYFILLED
AND
ABUNDANT
LIFE
BECAUSE
HE
HOLDS
CERTAIN
BELIEFS
DAN
JOHNSON
AND
GOD
SAID
JEEZE
THIS
IS
DULL
AND
IT
WAS
DULL
GENESIS
THESE
OPINIONS
PROBABLY
SHOW
WHAT
I
KNOW
