this
may
be
a
really
dumb
one
but
ill
ask
it
anyways
christians
know
that
they
can
never
live
up
to
the
requirements
of
god
right
i
may
be
wrong
but
that
is
my
understanding
but
they
still
try
to
do
it
doesnt
it
seem
like
we
are
spending
all
of
our
lives
trying
to
reach
a
goal
we
can
never
achieve
i
know
that
we
are
saved
by
faith
and
not
by
works
but
does
that
mean
that
once
we
are
saved
we
dont
have
to
do
anything
i
think
james
tells
us
that
faith
without
works
is
dead
paraphrase
how
does
this
work
so
long
as
we
think
that
good
things
are
what
we
have
to
do
rather
than
what
we
come
to
want
to
do
we
miss
the
point
the
more
we
love
god
the
more
we
come
to
love
what
and
whom
he
loves
when
i
find
that
what
i
am
doing
is
not
good
it
is
not
a
sign
to
try
even
harder
romans
it
is
a
sign
to
seek
god
when
i
am
aware
of
jesus
presence
i
usually
want
what
he
wants
it
is
his
strenth
his
love
that
empowers
my
weakness

i
apologize
to
the
moderator
but
the
first
quote
was
deleted
and
i
would
like
to
respond
to
both
as
for
the
goal
we
can
never
achieve
the
reward
comes
from
the
trying
paul
makes
a
clear
claim
that
we
are
to
continue
straining
for
the
prize
over
in
philippians
only
by
not
living
out
the
commands
do
we
stagnate
and
become
lukewarm
to
be
spit
out
by
jesus
as
it
says
in
john
this
is
love
for
god
to
obey
his
comands
that
obedience
is
our
straining
to
achieve
for
god
of
course
this
requires
work
on
our
part
as
for
the
quote
in
james
satan
doesnt
care
what
we
believe
what
matters
is
the
results
of
our
belief
works
if
one
truly
has
faith
in
what
one
believes
one
will
either
act
on
that
faith
or
be
lying
to
oneself
about
believing
in
the
first
place
stan
as
for
your
first
line
you
have
a
very
good
point
obedience
by
obligation
grudgery
is
not
what
god
desires
instead
look
at
how
many
times
the
bible
talks
about
being
joyous
in
all
situations
and
when
doing
gods
work
being
begrudged
by
the
work
has
no
value
also
we
should
do
the
work
necessary
whenever
we
can
not
just
when
we
feel
jesus
presence
feelings
can
deceive
us
however
as
paul
states
to
timothy
in
timothy
preach
the
word
be
prepared
in
season
and
out
of
season
correct
rebuke
and
encouragewith
great
patience
and
careful
instruction
also
remember
that
paul
tells
timothy
in
timothy
watch
your
life
and
doctrine
closely
persevere
in
them
because
if
you
do
you
will
save
both
yourself
and
your
hearers
so
in
order
to
do
the
work
necessary
we
need
to
be
sure
that
we
are
correct
first
remember
jesus
warning
in
matthew
not
to
be
hypocritical
about
what
we
do
the
best
way
to
accomplish
this
is
to
be
a
disciple
completely
in
both
thought
and
deed
