ANDREW
KILLE
WRITES
DAVE
DAVIS
WROTE
LOTS
DELETED
WITH
WHICH
I
GENERALLY
AGREE
THERE
IS
NO
INHERENTLY
DEFENSIBLE
ARGUMENT
FOR
THE
INCLUSION
OR
EXCLUSION
OF
THE
DEUTEROCANONICAL
BOOKS
I
THINK
EVERYONE
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
PRINCIPLES
THAT
CANNOT
BE
CONSISTENTLY
APPLIED
ARE
NOT
VERY
USEFUL
AS
PRINCIPLES
SO
IF
WE
ARE
TO
EXCLUDE
THEM
NOT
ACCORD
THEM
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
SCRIPTURE
WE
WOULD
APPEAR
TO
REQUIRE
OTHER
REASONS
WHAT
MIGHT
THESE
REASONS
BE
LETS
TALK
ABOUT
PRINCIPLES
IF
WE
ACCEPT
THAT
GOD
SETS
THE
STANDARDS
FOR
WHAT
OUGHT
TO
BE
INCLUDED
IN
SCRIPTURE
THEN
WE
CAN
ASK
IS
IT
AUTHORITATIVE
IS
IT
PROPHETIC
IS
IT
AUTHENTIC
IS
IT
DYNAMIC
IS
IT
RECEIVED
COLLECTED
READ
AND
USED
ON
THESE
COUNTS
THE
APOCRAPHA
FALLS
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
TO
QUOTE
UNGERS
BIBLE
DICTIONARY
ON
THE
APOCRAPHA
THEY
ABOUND
IN
HISTORICAL
AND
GEOGRAPHICAL
INACCURACIES
AND
ANACHRONISMS
THEY
TEACH
DOCTRINES
WHICH
ARE
FALSE
AND
FOSTER
PRACTICES
WHICH
ARE
AT
VARIANCE
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
THEY
RESORT
TO
LITERARY
TYPES
AND
DISPLAY
AN
ARTIFICIALITY
OF
SUBJECT
MATTER
AND
STYLING
OUT
OF
KEEPING
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
THEY
LACK
THE
DISTINCTIVE
ELEMENTS
WHICH
GIVE
GENUINE
SCRIPTURE
THEIR
DIVINE
CHARACTER
SUCH
AS
PROPHETIC
POWER
AND
POETIC
AND
RELIGIOUS
FEELING
MY
INTERIM
CONCLUSION
IS
THAT
PROTESTANT
EXCLUSION
OF
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THESE
WRITINGS
IS
ONE
OF
THOSE
TRADITIONS
OF
MEN
ONE
HEARS
OF
SO
OFTEN
THEY
WERE
EXCLUDED
DURING
THE
REFORMATION
AND
THAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
REASON
MANY
PEOPLE
CONTINUE
TO
EXCLUDE
THEM
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
ARGUMENT
LIES
IN
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
HEBREW
CANON
INCLUDED
THE
APOCRAPHA
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
IT
WASNT
UNTIL
THE
SIXTEENTH
CENTURY
THAT
LUTHER
AND
CO
THREW
THEM
OUT
THE
JEWISH
COUNCIL
YOU
MENTIONED
PREVIOUSLY
DIDNT
ACCEPT
THEM
SO
THE
REFORMATION
PROTESTANTS
HAD
GOOD
HISTORICAL
PRECEDENCE
FOR
THEIR
ACTIONS
JEROME
ONLY
TRANSLATED
THE
APOCRAPHA
UNDER
PROTEST
AND
IT
WAS
LITERALLY
OVER
HIS
DEAD
BODY
THAT
IT
WAS
INCLUDED
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
CANON
THE
SIMPLE
FACT
IS
THAT
PROTESTANT
EXCLUSION
ROMAN
INCLUSION
ORTHODOX
INCLUSION
OF
STILL
OTHER
BOOKS
OR
ANY
OTHER
DEFINITION
OF
A
CLOSED
CANON
IS
THE
DECISION
OF
A
COMMUNITY
OF
FAITH
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
STANDARD
COLLECTION
OF
SCRIPTURE
SHALL
BE
FOR
THAT
COMMUNITY
THEY
ALL
ARE
TRADITIONS
OF
MEN
WHETHER
ONE
CONSIDERS
THAT
TO
BE
A
PROBLEM
OR
NOT
DEPENDS
ON
WHICH
COMMUNITY
HAPPENS
TO
BE
YOURS
AND
HOW
YOU
ACCEPT
DEFINE
AUTHORITY
WITHIN
IT
I
PERSONALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
CLOSED
CANON
WHETHER
CATHOLIC
PROTESTANT
OR
ORTHODOX
IS
ONE
THAT
DEVELOPED
RATHER
LATE
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
WHICH
HAS
NOT
SERVED
THE
CHURCH
WELL
HOW
DO
YOU
THEN
VIEW
THE
WORDS
I
WARN
EVERYONE
WHO
HEARS
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
PROPHECY
OF
THIS
BOOK
IF
ANYONE
ADDS
ANYTHING
TO
THEM
GOD
WILL
ADD
TO
HIM
THE
PLAGUES
DESCRIBED
IN
THIS
BOOK
AND
IF
ANYONE
TAKES
AWAY
FROM
THIS
BOOK
THE
PROPHECY
GOD
WILL
TAKE
AWAY
FROM
HIM
HIS
SHARE
IN
THE
TREE
OF
LIFE
AND
IN
THE
HOLY
CITY
REV
SURELY
THIS
SETS
THE
STANDARD
AND
NOT
JUST
MANMADE
TRADITIONS
IT
IS
ALSO
NOTEWORTHY
TO
CONSIDER
JESUS
ATTITUDE
HE
HAD
NO
ARGUMENT
WITH
THE
PHARISEES
OVER
ANY
OF
THE
OT
CANON
JOHN
AND
EXPLAINED
TO
HIS
FOLLOWERS
ON
THE
ROAD
TO
EMMAUS
THAT
IN
THE
LAW
PROPHETS
AND
PSALMS
WHICH
REFERRED
TO
HIM
THE
OT
DIVISION
OF
SCRIPTURE
LUKE
AS
WELL
AS
IN
LUKE
TAKING
GENESIS
TO
CHRONICLES
THE
JEWISH
ORDER
WE
WOULD
SAY
GENESIS
TO
MALACHI
AS
SCRIPTURE

CHRISTIAN

FOR

CLEAR
AND
FAITHFUL
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
ORIGINS
AND
ISSUES
OF
THE
CANON
I
AM
NOT
FAMILIAR

BOOK

OTHER
ARGUMENTS
