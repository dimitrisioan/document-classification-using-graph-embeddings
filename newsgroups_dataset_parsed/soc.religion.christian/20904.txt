WRITES
PROBABLY
A

OLD
HORSE
BUT
MAYBE
WITH
A
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
TWIST
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
GOOD
ENGLISHLANGUAGE
TEXTS
FOR
LEARNING
ANCIENT
HEBREW
AND
HOW
THESE
COMPARE
WITH
GERMAN
EDUCATIONAL
TEXTS
QUALITYWISE
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
AN
IDEA
I
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
IF
I
SHOULD
BUY
ONE
HERE
FOR
LATER
STUDY
OR
WAIT
UNTIL
I
GET
BACK
TO
THE
US
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
FOR
ADVANCED
WORK
YOU
WILL
BE
MUCH
BETTER
OFF
WITH
GERMAN
REFERENCE
WORKS
LEXICONS
CONCORDANCES
ESPECIALLY
FOR
A
FIRSTTIME
ENCOUNTER
MY
PERSONAL
PREFERENCE
WOULD
BE
TO
DEAL
WITH
A
TEXTBOOK
WRITTEN
IN
MY
NATIVE
LANGUAGE
BUT
IF
YOU
KNOW
GERMAN
AND
ARE
IN
GERMANY
PICK
UP
ALL
THE
REFERENCE
BOOKS
YOU
THINK
YOU
CAN
HANDLE
I
ONLY
KNOW
THESE
WORKS
BY
REPUTATION
SINCE
MY
GERMAN
IS
MOST
RUSTY
BUT
ID

AT

WHATS
IT
LIKE
AT
DIVINITY
SCHOOLS
OR
SEMINARIES
IN
THE
STATES
IS
THERE
A
LOT
OF

INSTRUCTION
DONE
I
REALLY
DONT
HAVE
A
BASIS
FOR
COMPARISON
THE
AMOUNT
OF
LANGUAGE
INSTRUCTION
AVAILABLE
AT

SEMINARIES
VARIES
WIDELY
MOSTLY
DEPENDING
ON
THE
DENOMINATIONAL
HERITAGE
OF
THE
SCHOOL
PRESBYTERIAN
AND
REFORMED
SEMINARIES
PROBABLY
PLACE
A
LOT
MORE
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
BIBLICAL
LANGUAGES
THAN
OTHERS
OF
COURSE
ANY
DIVINITY
SCHOOL
THAT
HAS
A
DOCTORAL
PROGRAM
IN
BIBLICAL
STUDIES
IS
GOING
TO
HAVE
EXTENSIVE
LANGUAGE
RESOURCES
BUT
THERE
ARE
QUITE
A
FEW
MASTERSDEGREEGRANTING
SEMINARIES
HERE
AT
WHICH
THE
ATTITUDE
SEEMS
TO
BE
MORE
WELL
IF
YOURE
REALLY
INTERESTED
WELL
GIVE
YOU
A
SEMESTERLONG
COURSE
BUT
WE
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THE
PATTERN
HERE
AT
THE
LOUISVILLE
PRESBYTERIAN

IS
FOR

TO
TAKE
INTENSIVE
