QUALITY
OF
CATHOLIC
LITURGY
I
APPRECIATED
THE
FOLLOWUPS
AND
REPLIES
TO
MY
EARLIER
QUERY
ONE
REPLY
WHICH
I
HAVE
LOST
SUGGESTED
SEVERAL
PARISHES
IN
NEW
YORK
THAT
HAVE
GOOD
MASSES
ONE
OF
WHICH
WAS
CORPUS
CHRISTI
IN
DOWNTOWN
MANHATTAN
BY
COINCIDENCE
LAST
WEEKS
AMERICA
THE
NATIONAL
JESUIT
MAGAZINE
CARRIED
AN
INTERVIEW
WITH
FR
MYLES
BOURKE
CORPUS
CHRISTIS
PASTOR
EMERITUS
FR
BOURKE
ALSO
DIRECTED
THE
NT
TRANSLATION
IN
THE
NEW
AMERICAN
BIBLE
HE
NOTED
CERTAIN
PRACTICES
HAVE
BEEN
INTRODUCED
INTO
THE
MASS
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
THAT
AN
ATMOSPHERE
OF
BANALITY
AND
SOMETIMES
OF
HILARITY
HAS
TRIVIALIZED
THE
LITURGY
I
NOTE
THAT
AT
MY
PARENTS
PARISH
ON
EASTER
HELIUM
FILLED
BALLOONS
WERE
DISTRIBUTED
AT
THE
OFFERTORY
APPARENTLY
TO
AID
IN
UNDERSTANDING
THE
WORD
RISEN
THIS
WAS
NOT
A
KIDDIE
MASS
EITHER
BUT
THE
WELLATTENDED
MASS
I
WANTED
TO
NOTE
THE
GENEROUS
SPIRIT
BEHIND
THE
REPLIES
THIS
NEWSGROUP
AS
A
WHOLE
OFFERS
GENERALLY
MODERATE
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
ITS
MODERATED
CONVERSATION
ON
TOPICS
THAT
OFTEN
LEAD
PEOPLE
TO
EXTREME
BEHAVIOR
INCLUDING
MYSELF
SOMETIMES
PEOPLE
DO
GO
OVER
THE
TOP
BUT
THE
REMARKABLE
THING
IS
HOW
THAT
IS
THE
EXCEPTION
I
THINK
BENEFITS
OF
THE
DOUBT
ARE
GENERALLY
GRANTED
IT
SEEMS
