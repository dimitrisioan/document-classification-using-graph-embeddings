RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
IF
BABIES
ARE
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
BAPTISED
THEN
WHY
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
EVER
SAY
SO
IT
NEVER
COMES
RIGHT
AND
SAYS
ONLY
PEOPLE
THAT
KNOW
RIGHT
FROM
WRONG
OR
WHO
ARE
TAUGHT
CAN
BE
BAPTISED
THIS
IS
NOT
A
VERY
SOUND
ARGUMENT
FOR
BAPTISING
BABIES
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
IF
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
SAY
SPECIFICALLY
THAT
YOU
DONT
NEED
TO
DO
SOMETHING
THEN
THAT
MUST
MEAN
THAT
YOU
DO
NEED
TO
DO
IT
I
KNOW
THERES
A
SPECIFIC
TERM
FOR
THIS
FORM
OF
LOGIC
BUT
IT
ESCAPES
ME
RIGHT
NOW
HOWEVER
IF
IT
WERE
SOUND
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
APPLY
IT
THIS
WAY
IF
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
SPECIFICALLY
SAY
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
THEN
IT
MUST
BE
OK
WHICH
COINCIDENTALLY
LEADS
PERFECTLY
INTO
A
QUESTION
IVE
OFTEN
PONDERED
IF
SLAVERY
IS
IMMORAL
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
CAN
I
ASSUME
THAT
EVERYONE
ELSE
IN
THIS
GROUP
DOES
TOO
WHY
DOESNT
JESUS
OR
ANY
OF
THE
APOSTLES
SPEAK
OUT
AGAINST
IT
OWNING
SLAVES
WAS
COMMON
PRACTICE
BACK
THEN
PAUL
SPEAKS
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
THAT
IS
IMMORAL
HE
APPARENTLY
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THINGS
LIKE
NOT
BEING
A
DRUNKARD
WHY
DOESNT
ANYONE
MENTION
SLAVERY
IF
GODS
MORALS
ARE
ETERNAL
AND
DONT
CHANGE
LIKE
THE
MORALS
OF
SOCIETY
THEN
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
JUST
AS
IMMORAL
THEN
AS
IT
IS
TODAY
