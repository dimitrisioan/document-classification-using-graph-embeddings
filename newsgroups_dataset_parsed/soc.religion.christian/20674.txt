RELIGION
ESPECIALLY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
DRUG
SOME
PEOPLE
USE
DRUGS
AS
AN
ESCAPE
FROM
REALITY
CHRISTIANS
INJECT
THEMSELVES
WITH
JEEZUS
AND
LIVE
WITH
THAT
HIGH
YOUR
LOGIC
IS
FALTY
IF
CHRISTIANITY
IS
A
DRUG
AND
ONCE
WE
DIE
WE
DIE
THEN
WHY
WOULD
YOU
BE
RELUCTANT
TO
EMBRASE
THIS
DRUG
SO
THAT
WHILE
YOU
ARE
ALIVE
YOU
ENJOY
YOURSELF
PARDON
THE
HARSHNESS
THAT
FOLLOWS
ONCE
I
TOLD
A
CRADLE
CHRISTIAN
PLEASE
DO
NOT
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF

INSTEAD

COMPREHENDED
THIS

YOU
ARE
ONLY
DOING

LET
US
NOT
USE
JESUS
OUR
RELIGION
THE
BIBLE
ANYTHING
OR
ANYBODY
AS
A
MEANS
OF
ESCAPE
OR
GETTING
ECSTATIC
OR
HIGH
WE
ARE
GODS
CHILDREN
AND
WE
MUST
HAVE
A
TRUE
AND
AUTHENTIC
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
OUR
FATHER
WITH
OBEDIENCE
FAITH
HOPE
AND
LOVE
AND
WORKS
THE
LAST
AS
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
BEWARE
OF
OUR
MATERIALISTIC
WORLDLY
AND
SELFISH
MOTIVES
ATHEISTS
HAVE
THIS
GROUND
AGAINST
US
AND
I
BELIEVE
THEY
ARE
RIGHT
ABOUT

THEMSELVES
CHRISTIANS
