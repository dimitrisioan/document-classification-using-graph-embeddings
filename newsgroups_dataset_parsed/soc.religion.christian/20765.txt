DESIREE
BRADLEY
WRITES
I
MUST
HAVE
MISSED
THE
POSTINGS
ABOUT
WACO
DAVID
KORESH
AND
THE
SECOND
COMING
HOW
DOES
ONE
TELL
IF
A
SECOND
COMING
IS
THE
REAL
THING
UNLESS
THE
PERSON
CLAIMING
TO
BE
IT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
INSANE
FIRST
BY
HIS
FRUITS
THE
MESSIAH
COMES
TO
BUILD
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
ON
THE
EARTH
HE
ALSO
COMES
TO
FIRST
REVEAL
THE
ROOT
CAUSE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
FALLEN
NATURE
AND
THEN
PROVIDE
A
MEANS
TO
CUT
THE
CONNECTION
TO
THAT
ORIGINAL
SIN
HE
ALSO
WANTS
TO
CREATE
WORLD
PEACE
BASED
ON
GODISM
THE
MESSIAHS
TEACHINGS
WILL
BUILD
ON
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
BIBLE
BUT
PROVIDE
PROFOUND
NEW
INSIGHTS
INTO
THE
NATURE
OF
GOD
THE
FALL
OF
MAN
THE
PURPOSE
OF
CREATION
AND
GODS
PROVIDENCE
OF
RESTORATION
IT
WILL
ALSO
PROVIDE
A
FOUNDATION
FOR
THE
UNITY
OF
ALL
THE
WORLDS
RELIGIONS
MANY
CHRISTIANS
EXPECT
JESUS
TO
COME
ON
LITERAL
CLOUDS
SO
THEY
MAY
MISS
HIM
WHEN
HE
RETURNS
JUST
AS
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
MISSED
JESUS
YEARS
AGO
THEY
ARE
STILL
WAITING
FOR
HIS
FIRST
COMING
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
OF
THAT
AGE
EXPECTED
ELIJAH
TO
COME
FIRST
JESUS
SAID
THAT
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
WAS
ELIJAH
BUT
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
DENIED
THAT
HE
WAS
ELIJAH
HOW
DID
THIS
REFLECT
ON
JESUS
LATER
IN
PRISON
JOHN
EVEN
QUESTIONED
WHO
JESUS
WAS
IS
HE
THE
ONE
WHO
IS
TO
COME
OR
DO
WE
LOOK
FOR
ANOTHER
SEE
BOOK
OF
MATTHEW
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
DAVID
KORESH
IS
THE
SECOND
COMING
OF
CHRIST
HOW
COULD
SOMEBODY
WHO
BREAKS
HIS
WORD
BE
THE
SECOND
COMING
KORESH
DID
PROMISE
THAT
HE
WOULD
COME
OUT
OF
HIS
COMPOUND
IF
ONLY
HE
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
GIVE
A
RADIO
BROADCAST
HE
DIDNT
STILL
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
HE
DID
FOOL
SOME
PEOPLE
DAVID
KORESH
DIDNT
EVEN
COME
CLOSE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
LIKE
THIS
MAKE
IT
DIFFICULT
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
BELIEVE
AND
TRUST
IN
THE
REAL
MESSIAH
WHEN
HE
DOES
SHOW
UP
AND
FROM
MY
MEAGRE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
BIBLE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
BEEN
HARD
ON
THE
JEWS
OF
CHRISTS
DAY
FOR
BEING
CAUTIOUS
ABOUT
ACCEPTING
SOMEBODY
THAT
THEIR
RELIGIOUS
AUTHORITIES
DIDNT
ACCEPT
AS
THE
MESSIAH
SO
I
WAS
SURPRISED
THAT
NOBODY
HAD
DISCUSSED
THE
DIFFICULTY
OF
WANTING
TO
BE
EARLY
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
SECOND
COMING
WHILE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
NOT
WANTING
TO
BE
CREDULOUSLY
BELIEVING
JUST
ANYBODY
WHO
CLAIMS
TO
BE
GOD
VERY
GOOD
POINT
AND
PERHAPS
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
POINT
OF
ALL
FOR
CHRISTIANS
HOW
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
SECOND
COMING
THE
MESSIAH
SHOULD
NOT
CLAIM
TO
BE
GOD
WHAT
SETS
A
MESSIAH
APART
IS
THAT
HE
IS
BORN
WITHOUT
ORIGINAL
SIN
HE
IS
NOT
BORN
PERFECT
BUT
ACHIEVES
PERFECTION
AFTER
A
PERIOD
OF
GROWTH
ADAM
AND
EVE
WERE
BORN
SINLESS
BUT
THEY
FELL
AND
THIS
TRAGEDY
MEANT
THAT
IT
WOULD
TAKE
GOD
THOUSANDS
OF
YEARS
TO
CREATE
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
ON
THE
EARTH
AS
GOD
ORIGINALLY
INTENDED
GODS
RESTORATION
PROVIDENCE
IS
STILL
NOT
COMPLETE
THE
MESSIAH
IS
THE
TRUE
SON
OF
GOD
ONE
WITH
GOD
GODS
REPRESENTATIVE
ON
THE
EARTH
BUT
NOT
GOD
HIMSELF
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
GOD
MARK
AND
THEN
IF
ANY
ONE
SAYS
TO
YOU
LOOK
HERE
IS
THE
CHRIST
OR
LOOK
THERE
HE
IS
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IT
MARK
AND
THEN
THEY
WILL
SEE
THE
SON
OF
MAN
COMING
IN
CLOUDS
WITH
GREAT
POWER
AND
GLORY
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
JESUS
ANSWER
IS
THAT
UNLIKE
HIS
FIRST
COMING
WHICH
WAS
VEILED
THE
SECOND
COMING
WILL
BE
QUITE
UNMISTAKEABLE
BY
THE
WAY
FROM
KORESHS
PUBLIC
STATEMENT
ITS
NOT
SO
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
HE
IS
CLAIMING
TO
BE
CHRIST
WHO
ELSE
IN
THIS
WORLD
IS
CLAIMING
TO
BE
THE
MESSIAH
MAYBE
HES
ALREADY
HERE
