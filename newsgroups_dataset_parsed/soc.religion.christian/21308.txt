QUESTION
ABOUT
VIRGIN
MARY
AFARISTRLOZAU

WRITES
HELLLO
NETTERS
I
WAS
TOLD
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THAT
GOD
TOOK
THE
BODY
OF
THE
VIRGIN
MARY
AS
SHE
WAS
BEING
CARRIED
FOR
BURIAL
IS
THIS
TRUE
IF
SO
WERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
DOES
IT
SAY
THAT
REGARDS
AFARIS
I
THINK
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
THE
BLESSED
VIRGIN
MARY
IT
SAYS
THAT
THE
IMMACULATE
MOTHER
OF
GOD
THE
EVER
VIRGIN
MARY
HAVING
COMPLETED
THE
COURSE
OF
HER
EARTHLY
LIFE
WAS
ASSUMED
BODY
AND
SOUL
INTO
HEAVENLY
GLORY
THIS
WAS
DEFINED
BY
A
PAPAL
STATEMENT
IN
THOUGH
IT
HAD
CERTAINLY
BEEN
BELIEVED
BY
SOME
BEFORE
THAT
LIKE
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
THIS
IS
PRIMARILY
A
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
AND
LIKE
IT
IT
HAS
NO
DIRECT
BIBLICAL
SUPPORT
NOTE
THAT
CATHOLICS
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
THAT
IS
THEY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
THE
ONLY
SOURCE
OF
CHRISTIAN
KNOWLEDGE
THUS
THE
FACT
THAT
A
DOCTRINE
HAS
LITTLE
BIBLICAL
SUPPORT
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
SIGNIFICANT
TO
THEM
THEY
BELIEVE
THAT
TRUTH
CAN
BE
PASSED
ON
THROUGH
TRADITIONS
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
ALSO
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
REVEALED
TO
THE
CHURCH
IM
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
YET
ANOTHER
CATHOLICPROTESTANT
ARGUMENT
BUT
IF
ANY
CATHOLICS
CAN
TELL
US
THE
BASIS
FOR
THESE
BELIEFS
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
APPROPRIATE
CLH
AGAIN
I
FIND
MYSELF
WANTING
TO
RESPOND
TO
A
POSTING
AND
HAVING
NEITHER
THE
TIME
NOR
THE
PROPER
MATERIALS
WITH
ME
YOU
WOULD
THINK
I
WOULD
LEARN
MY
LESSON
BY
NOWBUT
IM
TRYING
TO
FINISH
WRITING
MY
THESIS
AND
DONT
HAVE
TONS
OF
TIME
ANYWAY
THE
BASIS
FOR
OUR
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCHS
BELIEF
IN
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
BODY
AND
SOUL
INTO
HEAVEN
IS
THAT
TO
PUT
IT
SIMPLY
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ALL
THE
EARLY
GENERATION
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVED
IT
IN
FACT
THROUGHOUT
THEIR
MINISTRY
THE
APOSTLES
KEPT
IN
CLOSE
CONTACT
WITH
MARY
AND
OF
THE
WERE
PRESENT
WHEN
SHE
DIED
ONLY
THOMAS
WAS
MISSINGWHEN
HE
ARRIVED
SEVERAL
DAYS
LATER
HE
ASKED
TO
BE
SHOWN
HER
BODY
AND
MOVED
WITH
PITY
PETER
AND
SEVERAL
OF
THE
OTHER
APOSTLES
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
HER
TOMB
WHEN
THEY
ARRIVED
THE
SEAL
WAS
STILL
UNBROKEN
THEY
BROKE
THE
SEAL
ENTERED
AND
THE
BODY
WAS
MISSING
THERE
WAS
NO
SIGN
THAT
ANYONE
HAD
ENTERED
FORCIBLY
OR
OTHERWISE
AND
EVERYTHING
ELSE
WAS
LAID
OUT
EXACTLY
AS
IT
HAD
BEEN
LEFT
THE
APOSTLES
PRESENT
ALL
BELIEVED
THAT
MARY
WAS
ASSUMED
INTO
HEAVENAND
THE
APOSTLES
TAUGHT
THIS
IN
THEIR
PREACHING
OF
COURSE
THIS
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
IN
ANY
OF
THE
TEXTS
CURRENTLY
CONSIDERED
PART
OF
THE
BIBLE
BUT
IT
DOES
APPEAR
IN
OTHER
WRITINGS
LEFT
BEHIND
BY
SEVERAL
OF
THEM
BASICALY
AS
AN
APOSTOLIC
CHURCH
IE
FOUNDED
BY
THE
APOSTLES
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
THE
APOSTLES
WHETHER
WRITTEN
DOWN
IN
THE
BIBLE
OR
WRITTEN
DOWN
IN
OTHER
SOURCES
IS
TRUE
PROVIDING
THAT
THE
AUTHENTICITY
OF
THOSE
OTHER
SOURCES
CAN
BE
CONFIRMED
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
THE
AUTHENTICITY
IS
QUITE
CLEAR
HOPE
THIS
HELPSI
WOULD
WELCOME
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
MORE
INFORMATION
TO
ADD
TO
