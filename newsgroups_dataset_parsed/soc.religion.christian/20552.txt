DOES
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
SEE
THE
CURRENT
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
ENVIRONMENT
BEING
TURNED
UNINTENTIONALLY
OF
COURSE
INTO
PANTHEISM
IVE
DEBATED
THIS
QUITE
A
BIT
AND
WHILE
I
THINK
A
LEGITIMATE
CONCERN
FOR
THE
PLANET
IS
A
GREAT
THING
I
CAN
EASILY
SEE
IT
BEING
PERVERTED
INTO
SOMETHING
DANGEROUS
MANY
PAGANS
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
ENVIRONMENTALISMTHIS
IS
ONLY
NATURAL
SINCE
RESPECT
FOR
THE
EARTH
IS
A
FUNDAMENTAL
TENET
OF
ALL
PAGAN
DENOMINATIONS
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
ENVIRONMENTALISM
IS
WRONG
ANY
MORE
THAN
SUPPORTING
PEACE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
IS
WRONG
BECAUSE
JEWS
AND
MUSLIMS
ALSO
WORK
FOR
IT
NONETHELESS
PAGANISM
IS
CERTAINLY
ON
THE
RISE
AND
WE
AS
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
ADDRESS
THIS
AND
LOOK
AT
WHAT
DRAWS
PEOPLE
FROM
PAGANISM
TO
CHRISTIANITY
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
PAGAN
RELIGIONS
ARE
ADDRESSING
NEEDS
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
SHOULD
BE
AND
ISNT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
PAGANISM
HAS
HIT
UPON
SOME
MAJOR
TRUTHS
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
FORGOTTEN
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
PAGANISM
IS
RIGHT
BUT
IT
DOES
MEAN
THAT
WE
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
LEARN
FROM
THE
PAGAN
MOVEMENT
FIRST
PAGANISM
RESPECTS
THE
FEMININE
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
A
LONG
HISTORY
OF
OPPRESSING
WOMEN
AND
MANY
IF
NOT
MOST
MALE
CHRISTIANS
ARE
STILL
UNABLE
TO
LIVE
IN
A
NONSEXIST
MANNER
THE
IDEA
THAT
GOD
IS
SEXLESS
OR
THAT
CHRIST
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
WOMEN
AND
STILL
ACCOMPLISHED
HIS
MISSION
IS
MET
WITH
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
RESISTANCE
THIS
INSISTANCE
ON
A
MALEDOMINATED
THEOLOGY
AND
THE
MALEDOMINATED
SOCIETY
THAT
GOES
WITH
IT
DRIVES
AWAY
MANY
YOUNG
WOMEN
WHO
HAVE
HAD
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
SEXIST
ATTITUDES
IN
THEIR
CHURCHES
SECOND
PAGANISM
RESPECTS
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
THIS
IS
AN
IDEA
WITH
GREAT
RAMIFICATIONS
ONE
OF
THESE
IS
ENVIRONMENTALISMRESPECT
FOR
OUR
SURROUNDINGS
AND
OUR
WORLD
ANOTHER
IS
INTEGRATION
OF
SEXUALITY
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
A
LONG
TRADITION
OF
CALLING
ALL
SEXUAL
FEEELINGS
SINFUL
AND
URGING
PEOPLE
TO
SUPPRESS
AND
DENY
THEIR
SEXUALITY
THIS
IS
TOO
MUCHSEX
IS
CLEARLY
A
PART
OF
HUMAN
EXPERIENCE
AND
ATTEMPTING
TO
REMOVE
IT
IS
SIMPLY
NOT
A
FEASIBLE
OPTION
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
ONLY
BEGUN
TO
DEVELOP
A
WORKABLE
SEXUAL
ETHIC
AND
PAGANISM
IS
AN
ATTRACTIVE
OPTION
IM
NOT
ADVOCATING
THAT
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINES
NO
SEX
BEFORE
MARRIAGE
ETC
SHOULD
BE
CHANGEDJUST
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WORK
TOWARD
A
MORE
MODERATE
ETHIC
OF
SEXUALITY
DENIAL
OF
SEXUALITY
PLACES
AS
MUCH
EMPHASIS
ON
SEX
AS
UNMODERATED
SEXUALITY
AND
NEITHER
ONE
DOES
MUCH
TO
BRING
