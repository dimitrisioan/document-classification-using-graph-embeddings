A
ROSE
AROSE
WRITES
GOD
TO
CALL
ME
TO
BE
A
PROPHET
AND
I
WERE
TO
MISREPRESENT
GODS
WORD
MY
CALLING
WOULD
BE
LOST
FOREVER
GODS
WORD
WOULD
COMMAND
THE
PEOPLE
NEVER
TO
LISTEN
TO
OR
FEAR
MY
WORDS
AS
I
WOULD
BE
A
FALSE
PROPHET
MY
BRIDGES
WOULD
BE
BURNT
FOREVER
PERHAPS
I
COULD
REPENT
AND
BE
SAVED
BUT
I
COULD
NEVER
AGAIN
BE
A
PROPHET
OF
GOD
THOUGH
THERE
IS
A
COMMAND
IN
THE
LAW
NOT
TO
HEED
TO
ONE
WHO
PROPHECIES
FALSELY
IT
IS
STILL
POSSIBLE
FOR
THE
ONE
WHO
HAS
PROPHECIED
FALSELY
TO
PROPHECY
TRUELY
AGAIN
TAKE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
STORY
IN
KINGS
ABOUT
THE
MAN
OF
GOD
FROM
JUDAH
WHO
CAME
TO
ISRAEL
AND
PROPHECIED
AGAINST
A
KING
THE
LORD
HAD
COMMANDED
HIM
TO
NOT
EAT
OR
DRINK
TILL
HE
RETURNED
HOME
ANOTHER
PROPHET
WANTED
THIS
MAN
OF
GOD
TO
STAY
IN
HIS
HOUSE
SO
HE
PROPHECIED
FALSELY
THAT
THE
LORD
WANTED
THE
MAN
OF
GOD
TO
STAY
IN
HIS
HOUSE
WHILE
THEY
ATE
AND
DRANK
IN
HIS
HOUSE
THE
LORD
GAVE
THE
PROPHET
WHO
LIED
A
WORD
THAT
THE
MAN
OF
GOD
WOULD
DIE
FROM
BREAKING
THE

OF
THE
