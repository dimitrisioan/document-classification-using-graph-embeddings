ps
if
you
do
sincerely
believe
that
a
god
exists
why
do
you
follow
it
blindly
do
the
words
question
authority
mean
anything
to
you
i
defy
any
theist
to
reply
ok
i
dont
follow
god
blindly
once
long
ago
i
questioned
authority
to
such
a
rabid
point
that
i
found
questionauthorityrejectauthority
unquestioningly
i
question
authority
all
the
time
but
to
forever
question
is
fruitlesseventually
we
have
to
consider
whether
there
are
answers
to
the
questions
whether
the
authority
say
the
bible
in
this
case
has
validity
basically
to
question
authority
does
not
necessarily
mean
reject
authority
