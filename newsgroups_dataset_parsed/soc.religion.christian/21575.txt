ANYONE
WHO
THINKS
BEING
GAY
AND
CHRISTIANITY
ARE
NOT
COMPATIBLE
SHOULD
CHECK
OUT
DIGNITY
INTEGRITY
MORE
LIGHT
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCHES
AFFIRMATION
MCC
CHURCHES
ETC
MEET
SOME
GAY
CHRISTIANS
FIND
OUT
WHO
THEY
ARE
PRAY
WITH
THEM
DISCUSS
SCRIPTURE
WITH
THEM
AND
ONLY
THEN
FORM
YOUR
OPINION
ALSO
CHECK
OUT
THE
EPISCOPAL
CHURCH
ALTHOUGH
BY
NO
MEANS
ALL
EPISCOPALIANS
ARE
SYMPATHETIC
TO
HOMOSEXUAL
MEN
AND
WOMEN
THERE
CERTAINLY
IS
A
FAIRLY
LARGE
PERCENTAGE
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
WHO
ARE
I
AM
GOOD
FRIENDS
WITH
AN
EPISCOPALIAN
MINISTER
WHO
IS
ORDAINED
AND
LIVING
IN
A
MONOGAMOUS
HOMOSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIP
THIS
IN
NO
WAY
DIMINISHES
HIS
ABILITY
TO
MINISTER
IN
FACT
HE
HAS
A
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
MINISTRY
WITH
THE
GAY
AND
LESBIAN
ASSOCIATION
OF
HIS
COMMUNITY
AS
WELL
AS
A
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
AIDS
MINISTRY
MY
UNCLE
IS
GAY
AND
WHEN
I
FOUND
THIS
OUT
I
HAD
A
GOOD
LONG
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
HAS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THIS
AND
WHAT
I
FEEL
GOD
THINKS
ABOUT
THIS
OBVIOUSLY
MY
CONCLUSIONS
MAY
BE
WRONG
NONETHELESS
THEY
ARE
MY
OWN
AND
THEY
FEEL
RIGHT
TO
ME
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ONE
IMPORTANT
THING
THAT
THOSE
WHO
WROTE
THE
OLD
AND
NEW
TESTAMENT
PASSAGES
CITED
ABOVE
DID
NOT
KNOW
WAS
THAT
THERE
IS
SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
AT
LEAST
PARTLY
INHERENT
RATHER
THAN
COMPLETELY
LEARNED
THIS
MEANS
THAT
TO
A
CERTAIN
EXTENT
OR
TO
A
GREAT
EXTENT
HOMOSEXUALS
CANNOT
CHOOSE
HOW
TO
FEEL
ABOUT
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHICH
IS
WHY
REPORTS
OF
CURING
HOMOSEXUALS
ALWAYS
CHILL
ME
AND
MAKE
ME
FEEL
ILL
PLEASE
NOT
THAT
ALTHOUGH
I
CANT
CITE
SOURCES
WHERE
YOU
CAN
FIND
THIS
INFORMATION
THERE
IS
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
RECORDED
AMONG
MONKEYS
AND
OTHER
ANIMALS
WHICH
IS
IN
ITSELF
SUGGESTIVE
THAT
IT
IS
INHERENT
RATHER
THAN
LEARNED
OR
AT
LEAST
THAT
THE
WORD
UNNATURAL
SHOULDNT
REALLY
APPLY
PLEASE
REMEMBER
THAT
WHATEVER
YOU
BELIEVE
GAYS
AND
LESBIANS
SHOUL
NOT
BE
EXCLUDED
FROM
YOUR
LOVE
AND
ACCEPTANCE
CHRIST
LOVED
US
ALL
AND
WE
ALL
SIN
AND
HE
HIMSELF
NEVER
SAID
ANYTHING
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALS
RATHER
IT
IS
PAUL
WHO
ALSO
CAME
OUT
WITH
SUCH
WONDERFUL
WISDOM
AS
WOMEN
SHOULDNT
SPEAK
IN
CHURCH
AND
WOMEN
SHOULD
KEEP
THEIR
HEADS
COVERED
IN
CHURCH
NOT
EXACT
QUOTATIONS
AS
I
DONT
HAVE
MY
BIBLE
HANDY
WHO
SAYS
THESE
THINGS
I
HAVE
A
TENDENCY
TO
TAKE
SOME
OF
THE
THINGS
PAUL
SAYS
WITH
A
GRAIN
OF
SALT
