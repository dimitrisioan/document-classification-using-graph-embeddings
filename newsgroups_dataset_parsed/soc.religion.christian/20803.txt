theists
and
objectivity
can
a
theist
be
truly
objective
can
he
be
impartial
when
questioning
the
truth
of
his
scriptures
or
will
he
assume
the
superstition
of
his
parents
when
questioning
ive
often
found
it
to
be
the
case
that
the
theist
will
stick
to
some
kind
of
superstition
when
wondering
about
god
and
his
scriptures
ive
seen
it
in
the
christian
the
jew
the
muslim
and
the
other
theists
alike
all
assume
that
their
mothers
and
fathers
were
right
in
the
aspect
that
a
god
exists
and
with
that
belief
search
for
their
god
occasionally
the
theist
may
switch
religions
or
aspects
of
the
same
religion
but
overall
the
majority
keep
to
the
belief
that
some
creator
was
behind
the
universes
existence
ive
known
muslims
who
were
once
christians
and
vice
versa
ive
known
christians
who
were
once
jewish
and
vice
versa
and
ive
even
known
christians
who
become
hindu
yet
throughout
their
transition
from
one
faith
to
another
theyve
kept
this
belief
in
some
form
of
higher
being
why
it
usually
all
has
to
do
with
how
the
child
is
brought
up
from
the
time
he
is
born
the
theist
is
brought
up
with
the
notion
of
the
truth
of
some
kind
of
scripture
the
bible
the
torah
the
quran
etc
he
is
told
of
this
wondrous
god
who
wrote
or
inspired
the
scripture
of
the
prophets
talked
about
in
the
scripture
of
the
miracles
performed
etc
he
is
also
told
that
to
question
this
as
children
are
apt
to
do
is
a
sin
a
crime
against
god
and
to
lose
belief
in
the
scrip
tures
truth
is
to
damn
ones
soul
to
hell
thus
by
the
time
he
is
able
to
read
the
scripture
for
himself
the
belief
in
its
truth
is
so
ingrained
in
his
mind
it
all
seems
a
matter
of
course
but
it
doesnt
stop
there
once
the
child
is
able
to
read
for
himself
there
is
an
endeavor
to
inculcate
the
child
the
right
readings
of
scripture
to
concentrate
more
on
the
pleasant
readings
to
gloss
over
the
worse
ones
and
to
explain
away
the
unexplainable
with
mystery
circular
arguments
selfevdent
facts
and
truths
unreasoning
belief
and
fear
of
hell
is
the
meat
of
religion
the
child
must
eat
of
every
day
to
doubt
of
course
means
wrath
of
some
sort
and
the
child
must
learn
to
put
away
his
brain
when
the
matter
concerns
god
all
of
this
has
some
considerable
effect
on
the
child
so
that
when
he
becomes
an
adult
the
superstitions
hes
been
taught
are
nearly
impossible
to
remove
all
of
this
leads
me
to
ask
whether
the
theist
can
truly
be
objective
when
questioning
god
hell
heaven
the
angels
souls
and
all
of
the
rest
can
he
for
a
moment
put
aside
this
notion
that
god
does
exist
and
look
at
everything
from
a
unbiased
point
of
view
obviously
most
theists
can
somewhat
especially
when
presented
with
mythical
gods
homeric
roman
egyptian
etc
but
can
they
put
aside
the
assumption
of
gods
existence
and
question
it
impartially
stephen
atheist
libertarian
proindividuality
proresponsibility
jr
and
all
that
jazz
this
is
ad
hominem
attack
of
the
most
basic
kind
none
of
their
statements
matter
they
believe
the
way
they
do
because
they
were
brought
up
that
way
of
course
there
are
atheists
who
have
become
theists
and
theists
who
have
become
atheists
rather
more
of
the
latter
which
is
not
surprising
given
the
statistics
its
hard
to
see
how
one
could
possibly
answer
a
posting
of
this
sort
since
any
answer
could
immediately
be
assumed
to
be
just
part
of
the
brainwashing
that
is
how
can
anyone
possibly
show
that
they
arent
biased
