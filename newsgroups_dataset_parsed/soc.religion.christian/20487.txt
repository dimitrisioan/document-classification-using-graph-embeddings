MATT
GO
THEREFORE
TO
THE
MAIN
HIGHWAYS
AND
AS
MANY
AS
YOU
FIND
THERE
INVITE
TO
THE
WEDDING
FEAST
HMMMMMM
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOUR
THEOLOGY
AND
CHRISTS
ARE
AT
ODDS
WHICH
ONE
AM
I
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THIS
PARABLE
JESUS
TELLS
THE
PARABLE
OF
THE
WEDDING
FEAST
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
LIKE
UNTO
A
CERTAIN
KING
WHICH
MADE
A
MARRIAGE
FOR
HIS
SON
SO
THE
WEDDING
CLOTHES
WERE
CUSTOMARY
AND
GIVEN
TO
THOSE
WHO
CHOSE
TO
ATTEND
THIS
MAN
REFUSED
TO
WEAR
THE
CLOTHES
THE
WEDDING
CLOTHES
ARE
EQUALIVANT
TO
THE
CLOTHES
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
WHEN
JESUS
DIED
FOR
OUR
SINS
THOSE
CLOTHES
WERE
THEN
PROVIDED
LIKE
THAT
MAN
IT
IS
OUR
DECISION
TO
PUT
THE
CLOTHES
ON
