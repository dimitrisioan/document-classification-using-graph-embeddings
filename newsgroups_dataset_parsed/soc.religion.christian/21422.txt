I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
FINDING
OUT
WHY
PEOPLE
BECOME
ATHEISTS
AFTER
HAVING
BELIEVED
IN
SOME
GODGOD
IN
CONVERSING
WITH
THEM
ON
OTHER
GROUPS
IVE
OFTEN
SENSED
ANGER
OR
HOSTILITY
THOUGH
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
IMPLY
THAT
ALL
ATHEISTS
ARE
ANGRY
OR
HOSTILE
IT
DOES
SEEM
TO
BE
ONE
MOTIVATION
FOR
GIVING
UP
FAITH
THUS
SOME
ATHEISM
MIGHT
RESULT
FROM
BROKENNESS
ID
LIKE
TO
FIELD
THIS
ONE
IF
I
MAY
ALTHOUGH
I
AM
A
BELIEVER
IN
AND
FOLLOWER
OF
CHRIST
MY
EXPERIENCES
WITH
RELIGION
HAVENT
BEEN
ALL
THAT
POSITIVE
IN
FACT
THERE
WAS
ONE
POINT
IN
MY
LIFE
WHEN
FOR
ABOUT
THREE
DAYS
I
SIMPLY
COULDNT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
GOD
ANYWAY
WHEN
I
LOOK
BACK
UPON
THE
TROUBLES
IVE
HAD
THEY
SEEM
TO
FALL
INTO
TWO
CATEGORIES
IMPULSES
TO
UNBELIEF
THAT
RESULTED
FROM
LOGICAL
CONTRADICTIONS
AND
IMPULSES
TO
UNBELIEF
THAT
RESULTED
FROM
FRUSTRATION
WITH
GOD
THE
FIRST
CATEGORY
DOESNT
OCCUR
TO
ME
MUCH
ANYMORE
AS
I
HAVE
WORKED
THROUGH
MOST
OF
THE
ARGUMENTS
FOR
THE
NONEXISTENCE
OF
GOD
BUT
WAY
BACK
WHEN
THESE
WOULD
CAUSE
ME
SOME
PROBLEMS
AND
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
STRUGGLE
WITH
MY
FAITH
TO
CONTINUE
TO
BELIEVE
I
CAN
SEE
WHERE
OTHERS
LESS
STUBBORN
THAN
I
AND
I
DO
MEAN
STUBBORN
STUBBORNESS
HAS
OFTEN
BEEN
THE
ONLY
THING
STANDING
BETWEEN
ME
AN
ATHEISM
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
WOULD
FAIL
THE
SECOND
CATEGORY
ARISES
OUT
OF
SOME
LONGTERM
PERSONAL
DIFFICULTIES
AND
THE
STRUGGLE
TO
LIVE
MY
LIFE
AS
GOD
WOULD
HAVE
ME
LIVE
IT
WITHOUT
LIVING
MY
LIFE
AS
OTHERS
WOULD
TELL
ME
HOW
GOD
WOULD
HAVE
ME
LIVE
IT
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
OF
THIS
IS
MY
STRUGGLE
WITH
THE
MORE
RADICAL
CHRISTIANS
I
MEET
I
AM
NOT
NOR
HAVE
I
EVER
BEEN
ON
FIRE
FOR
CHIRST
AND
I
DONT
THINK
I
EVER
WANT
TO
BE
NEVERTHELESS
I
AM
NOT
LUKEWARM
ABOUT
MY
FAITH
SO
I
DONT
REALLY
FIT
IN
WITH
THE
MAINSTREAM
EITHER
QUITE
NATURALLY
I
FEEL
A
LOT
OF
ANXIETY
ABOUT
MY
DISLOCATION
WITHIN
CHRISTIAN
SOCIETY
AND
IT
CAN
LEAD
TO
A
LOT
OF
INTERNAL
TENSION
WHEN
I
WANT
TO
DO
WHAT
I
KNOW
IS
RIGHT
BUT
WHEN
ANOTHER
PART
OF
ME
BELIEVES
THAT
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
DO
IS
WRONG
BECAUSE
ALL
THE
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
THINK
SO
TO
QUITE
NATURALLY
THIS
TENSION
HAS
A
DESTRUCTIVE
EFFECT
ON
MY
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
AND
DURING
ALL
OF
THIS
INTERNAL
STRIFE
THERES
ATHEISM
SITTING
THERE
LIKE
THE
PROMISED
LAND
NO
RULES
NO
RESPONSIBILITIES
NO
NEED
TO
LIVE
UP
TO
ANYONES
EXPECTATIONS
BUT
MY
OWN
COMPLETE
FREEDOM
OF
COURSE
ITS
ALL
AN
ILLUSION
BUT
NEVERTHELESS
ITS
A
VERY
APPEALING
ILLUSION
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THE
SOCALLED
PEOPLE
OF
GOD
ARE
BEHAVING
LIKE
TOTAL
TWITS
I
CAN
EASILY
UNDERSTAND
WHY
SOMEONE
WOULD
GO
THAT
ROUTE
AND
WOULD
BE
HOSTILE
TO
EVER
COMING
BACK
IMHO
MANY
OF
THE
FORMERCHRISTIANSTURNEDATHEISTSWHOARENOWACTIVELY
HOSTILETOCHRISTIANITY
ARE
SO
BECAUSE
THEIR
EXPERIENCE
WITH
CHRIST
AND
GOD
WASNT
A
VERY
PEACEFUL

COURTESY
OF
SOME
OF
CHRISTS
MORE
OVERZEALOUS
FOLLOWERS
A
FINAL
REASON
WHY
PEOPLE
BECOME
ATHEISTS
IS
BECAUSE
CHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
VERY
GOOD
REPUTATION
RIGHT
NOW
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
ATTRACTED
PEOPLE
TO
CHRISTIANITY
IN
THE
ANCIENT
DAYS
WAS
THE
LOVE
THAT
CHRISTIANS
OBVIOUSLY
HAD
FOR
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
THE
WORLD
AROUND
THEM
UNLIKE
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
CHRISTIAN
COMMUNITIES
ACTIVELY
CARED
FOR
THEIR
POOR
AND
THE
CHRISTIAN
RICH
DID
NOT
TROD
ON
THE
BACKS
OF
THEIR
POORER
BROTHERS
BUT
BENT
DOWN
TO
HELP
THEM
CHRISTIANS
WERE
KNOWN
FOR
LIVING
EXEMPLARY
LIVES
EVEN
IF
THEY
WERE
THOUGHT
TO
BE
TRAITORS
TO
THE
STATE
BECAUSE
THEY
WOULDNT
SACRIFICE
TO
THE
EMPORER
NOWADAYS
COURTESY
OF
THE
MEDIA
AND
SOME
CHRISTIAN
LEADERS
WHO
LOST
CHRIST
ON
THEIR
WAY
TO
POWER
PEOPLE
SEE
CHRISTIANS
AS
SEXUALLYREPRESSED
HIPPOCRITICAL
BUSIBODIES
WHO
WANT
TO
REMAKE
SOCIETY
INTO
A
FACIST
VERSION
OF
THEIR
OWN
MORAL
VIEW
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
MORE
REASONS
WHY
PEOPLE
BECOME
ATHEISTS
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
GO
INTO
THEM
RIGHT
