TIMOTHY
J
LUOMA
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
SUPPOSE
YOU
WERE
PART
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
CONSIPRACY
WHICH
WAS
GOING
TO
TELL
PEOPLE
THAT
CHRIST
HAD
RISEN
NEVER
MIND
THE
STONING
THE
BEING
BURNED
ALIVE
THE
POSSIBLE
CRUCIFIXION
LETS
JUST
TALK
ABOUT
A
SCOURGING
THE
WHIP
THAT
WOULD
BE
USED
WOULD
HAVE
BROKEN
POTTERY
METAL
BONE
AND
ANYTHING
ELSE
THAT
THEY
COULD
FIND
ATTACHED
TO
IT
YOU
WOULD
BE
STOOD
FACING
A
WALL
WITH
NOTHING
TO
PROTECT
YOU
SCREAM
OUT
IN
AGONY
THAT
YOUR
RAW
BACK
WAS
BEING
TORN
AT
AGAIN
YOU
WOULD
SAY
TO
YOURSELF
ALL
THIS
FOR
A
LIE
AND
YOU
HAD
MORE
COMING
AT
THE
THIRD
HIT
YOU
WOULD
SCREAM
OUT
THAT
IT
WAS
ALL
A
LIE
BEG
FOR
THEM
TO
STOP
AND
TELL
THEM
THAT
YOU
WOULD
SWEAR
ON
YOUR
LIFE
THAT
IT
HAD
ALL
BEEN
A
LIE
IF
THEY
WOULD
ONLY
STOP
NO
ONE
WAS
EVER
FLOGGED
BEATEN
BURNED
FED
TO
THE
LIONS
OR
KILLED
IN
ANY
OTHER
WAY
BECAUSE
OF
A
BELIEF
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
SORRY
TO
DISAPPOINT
YOU
THE
IDEA
OF
RESURRECTION
IS
ONE
WHICH
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
A
HOST
OF
DIFFERENT
FORMS
IN
THE
RELIGIONS
OF
ANTIQUITY
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
NOT
THE
RESURRECTION
WHICH
WAS
A
MEDIORCE
ISSUE
FOR
A
TINY
FRAGMENT
OF
THE
JEWISH
POPULATION
THE
SADUCEES
BUT
WAS
A
NON
ISSUES
FOR
EVERYONE
ELSE
THE
REAL
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WERE
PACIFIST
AND
PREACHED
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
GOD
WHEN
THE
STATE
OPERATES
BY
A
SYSTEM
OF
DIVINITATION
OF
THE
EMPEROR
MONOTHEISM
BECOMES
A
CAPITAL
OFFENSE
THE
JEWS
WERE
ABLE
TO
GET
EXEMPTION
FROM
THIS
AND
WERE
ALSO
NOT
EVANGELISTIC
CHRISTIANS
WERE
FAR
MORE
VOCAL
AND
GENTILE
AND
HENCE
DANGEROUS
AND
WERE
THEREFORE
TARGETS
OF
PERSECUTION
ALSO
SINCE
CHRISTIANS
WERE
A
RELATIVELY
POWERLESS
GROUP
THEY
MADE
GOOD
SCAPEGOATS
AS
IS
SEEN
BY
NEROS
BLAMING
THEM
FOR
THE
BURNING
OF
ROME
LETS
NOT
CLOUD
THE
ISSUES
WITH
THE
RESURRECTION
RANDY
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WERE
NOT
PERSECUTED
SPECIFICALLY
BECAUSE
THEY
BELIEVED
IN
RESURRECTION
HOWEVER
THE
BELIEFS
THAT
DID
CAUSE
TROUBLE
WERE
DEPENDENT
ON
BELIEF
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
JESUS
OF
COURSE
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
IT
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
ALTERNATIVES
OTHER
THAN
A
GREAT
CONSPIRACY
THE
MOST
COMMON
THEORY
AMONG
NONCHRISTIANS
SCHOLARS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
THE
RESURRECTION
WAS
A
SUBJECTIVE
EVENT
IN
EFFECT
A
DELUSION
