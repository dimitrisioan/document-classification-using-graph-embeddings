PETER
I
WROTE
THAT
I
THOUGHT
THAT
PETER
MEANT
NO
PROPHECY
OF
SCRIPTURE
OR
AS
ONE
READER
SUGGESTS
NO
WRITTEN
PROPHECY
IS
MERELY
THE
PRIVATE
OPINION
OF
THE
WRITER
TONY
ZAMORA
REPLIES
SAT
MAY
THAT
THIS
IN
TURN
IMPLIES
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
THE
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
READER
EITHER
I
AM
NOT
SURE
THAT
I
UNDERSTAND
THIS
IN
ONE
SENSE
NO
STATEMENT
BY
ANOTHER
IS
SUBJECT
TO
MY
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
IF
RELIABLE
HISTORIANS
TELL
ME
THAT
THE
ATHENIANS
LOST
THE
PELOPENNESIAN
WAR
I
CANNOT
SIMPLY
INTERPRET
THIS
AWAY
BECAUSE
I
WANTED
THE
ATHENIANS
TO
WIN
FACTS
ARE
FACTS
AND
DO
NOT
GO
AWAY
BECAUSE
I
WANT
THEM
TO
BE
OTHERWISE
IN
ANOTHER
SENSE
EVERY
STATEMENT
IS
SUBJECT
TO
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
IN
THAT
I
HAVE
TO
DEPEND
ON
MY
BRAINS
AND
EXPEREIENCE
TO
DECIDE
WHAT
IT
MEANS
AND
WHETHER
IT
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
WELL
ATTESTED
TO
MERIT
MY
ASSENT
EVEN
IF
THE
STATEMENT
OCCURS
IN
AN
INSPIRED
WRITING
I
STILL
HAVE
TO
DECIDE
USING
MY
OWN
BEST
JUDGEMENT
WHETHER
IT
IS
IN
FACT
INSPIRED
THIS
IS
NOT
ARROGANCE
IT
IS
JUST
AN
INESCAPABLE
FACT
