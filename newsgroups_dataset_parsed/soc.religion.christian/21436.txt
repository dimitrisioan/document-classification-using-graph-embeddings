ANY
ONE
WHO
THINKS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
CHRISTIANITY
ARE
COMPATIBLE
SHOULD
CHECK
OUT
ROMANS
I
CORINTHIANS
I
TIMOTHY
JUDE
II
PETER
GEN
LEV
TO
NAME
A
FEW
OF
THE
VERSES
THAT
PERTAIN
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
HOMOSEXUAL
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
INDEED
CHECKED
OUT
THESE
VERSES
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
USED
AGAINST
US
ONLY
THROUGH
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
INTERPRETATIONS
OTHERS
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUES
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
ABOVE
VERSES
DO
NOT
CLEARLY
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUES
HOWEVER
A
COUPLE
OF
THEM
SEEM
AS
THOUGH
THEY
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
INTERPRETATIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
SEEN
AS
CONDEMNING
HOMOSEXUALITY
DO
NOT
BE
DECEIVED
NEITHER
FORNICATORS
NOR
IDOLATORS
NOR
ADULTERERS
NOR
EFFEMINATE
NOR
HOMOSEXUALS
NOR
THIEVES
NOR
THE
COVETOUS
NOR
DRUNKARDS
NOR
REVILERS
NOR
SWINDLERS
SHALL
INHERIT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
AND
SUCH
WERE
SOME
OF
YOU
I
COR
WOULD
SOMEONE
CARE
TO
COMMENT
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ABOVE
SEEMS
TO
SAY
FORNICATORS
WILL
NOT
INHERIT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
HOW
DOES
THIS
APPLY
TO
HOMOSEXUALS
I
UNDERSTAND
FORNICATION
TO
BE
SEX
OUTSIDE
OF
MARRIAGE
IS
THIS
AN
ACCURATE
DEFINITION
IS
THERE
ANY
SUCH
THING
AS
SAMESEX
MARRIAGE
IN
THE
BIBLE
MY
UNDERSTANDING
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THAT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
BLESSES
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
ONLY
BETWEEN
A
HUSBAND
AND
HIS
WIFE
I
AM
HOWEVER
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
SCRIPTURAL
EVIDENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
YOU
SHALL
NOT
LIE
WITH
A
MALE
AS
ONE
LIES
WITH
A
FEMALE
IT
IS
AN
ABOMINATION
ALSO
YOU
SHALL
NOT
HAVE
INTERCOURSE
WITH
ANY
ANIMAL
TO
BE
DEFILED
WITH
IT
NOR
SHALL
ANY
WOMAN
STAND
BEFORE
AN
ANIMAL
TO
MATE
WITH
IT
IT
IS
A
PERVERSION
LEV
I
NOTICE
THAT
THE
VERSE
FORBIDDING
BESTIALITY
IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWS
THE
VERSE
PROHIBITING
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
I
KNOW
OF
NO
NEW
TESTAMENT
PASSAGES
THAT
CLEARLY
CONDEMN
OR
EVEN
MENTION
INTERCOURSE
WITH
ANIMALS
DO
THOSE
WHO
ARGUE
FOR
THE
LEGITIMACY
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
CONDEMNS
BESTIALITY
AS
A
PERVERSION
AND
IF
SO
WHY
THAT
IS
WHAT
VERSES
WOULD
YOU
CITE
TO
PROVE
THAT
BESTIALITY
WAS
PERVERTED
AND
SINFUL
COULD
THE
VERSES
YOU
CITE
BE
REFUTED
BY
INTERPRETING
THEM
DIFFERENTLY
CAN
ONE
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
ZOOPHILE
BY
THE
WAY
I
MYSELF
AM
SUBJECT
TO
SEXUAL
DESIRES
THAT
I
DID
NOT
CHOOSE
TO
HAVE
AND
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WOULD
REGARD
AS
PERVERTED
AND
SINFUL
SO
PLEASE
UNDERSTAND
THAT
I
AM
NOT
ASKING
THESE
QUESTIONS
OUT
OF
AN
ANTIPATHY
TOWARDS
MY
FELLOW
PEOPLE
OF
ALTERNATIVE
ORIENTATIONS
I
DO
BELIEVE
HOWEVER
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
READ
THE
BIBLE
WITH
AN
ATTITUDE
OF
WHAT
IS
THE
BIBLE
TRYING
TO
SAY
AND
NOT
WHAT
DO
I
WANT
THE
BIBLE
TO
SAY
I
CHOOSE
NOT
TO
GIVE
IN
TO
MY
PERVERTED
SEXUAL
DESIRES
BECAUSE
I
BELIEVE
THE
BIBLE
TRIES
TO
TELL
ME
WHETHER
I
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
THAT
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
SIN
IT
IS
FRUSTRATING
AT
TIMES
AND
I
HAVE
HAD
DAYS
WHERE
IT
REALLY
GOT
ME
DOWN
BUT
I
DONT
BLAME
GOD
FOR
THIS
I
BLAME
THE
SIN
ITSELF
MARK
THERES
SOME
AMBIGUITY
ABOUT
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORDS
IN
THE
PASSAGE
YOU
QUOTE
BOTH
LIBERAL
AND
CONSERVATIVE
SOURCES
SEEM
TO
AGREE
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
IS
NOT
THE
GENERAL
TERM
FOR
HOMOSEXUALS
BUT
IS
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
A
MEANING
LIKE
HOMOSEXUAL
PROSTITUTE
THAT
DOESNT
MEANT
THAT
I
THINK
ALL
THE
BIBLICAL
EVIDENCE
VANISHES
BUT
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
SUCH
THAT
YOU
CANT
JUST
QUOTE
ONE
VERSE
AND
SOLVE
THINGS
I
THINK
YOUR
ARGUMENT
FROM
FORNICATION
IS
CIRCULAR
WHY
IS
HOMOSEXUALITY
WRONG
BECAUSE
ITS
FORNICATION
WHY
IS
IT
FORNICATION
BECAUSE
THEYRE
NOT
MARRIED
WHY
ARENT
THEY
MARRIED
BECAUSE
THE
CHURCH
REFUSES
TO
DO
A
MARRIAGE
CEREMONY
WHY
DOES
THE
CHURCH
REFUSE
TO
DO
A
MARRIAGE
CEREMONY
BECAUSE
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
WRONG
IN
ORDER
TO
BREAK
THE
CIRCLE
THERES
GOT
TO
BE
SOME
OTHER
REASON
TO
THINK
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
WRONG
