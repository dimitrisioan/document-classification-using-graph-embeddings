re
opinions
asked
about
rejection
heres
how
i
talk
to
nonchristians
who
are
complaining
about
hell
me
do
you
believe
youre
going
to
heaven
him
i
dont
believe
in
heaven
me
so
are
you
going
there
him
if
there
was
a
heaven
i
would
me
but
since
there
isnt
a
heaven
youre
not
going
there
are
you
him
no
the
point
is
that
heaven
is
based
on
faithif
you
dont
believe
in
heaven
theres
no
way
youre
going
to
be
in
it
of
course
the
next
step
is
i
dont
believe
in
hell
either
so
why
will
i
be
there
it
seems
to
me
that
hell
is
eternal
death
and
seperation
from
god
most
atheists
do
believe
that
when
they
die
they
will
die
forever
and
never
see
godso
they
do
in
fact
believe
that
theyre
going
to
hell
hell
doesnt
have
to
be
worse
than
earth
to
be
hellbecause
its
eternal
and
its
a
lot
worse
than
heaven
thats
the
only
comparison
that
matters
