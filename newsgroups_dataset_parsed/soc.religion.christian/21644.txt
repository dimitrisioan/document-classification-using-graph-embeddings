HELL
ON
APRIL
STEPHEN
MCINTYRE
WRITES
I
WOULD
RATHER
SPEND
AN
ETERNITY
IN
HELL
THAN
BE
BESIDE
GOD
IN
HEAVEN
KNOWING
THAT
EVEN
ONE
MAN
WOULD
SPEND
HIS
ETERNAL
LIFE
BEING
SCORCHED
FOR
HIS
WRONGDOINGS
STEPHEN
I
SUSPECT
THAT
WHEN
YOU
AND
I
USE
THE
WORD
HELL
WE
HAVE
DIFFERENT
CONCEPTS
IN
MIND
WHEN
YOU
ENCOUNTER
REFERENCES
TO
HEAVEN
IN
TERMS
OF
CROWNS
AND
HARPS
AND
GOLDEN
STREETS
I
TRUST
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
SUPPOSE
OR
SUSPECT
CHRISTIANS
OF
SUPPOSING
THAT
THE
GOLDEN
STREETS
ARE
TO
BE
TAKEN
LITERALLY
STILL
LESS
THAT
THEY
ARE
WHAT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
HEAVEN
IS
ALL
ABOUT
WHY
THEN
SHOULD
YOU
SUPPOSE
THAT
ABOUT
THE
FIRES
OF
HELL
HAVE
YOU
READ
THE
NOVEL
ATLAS
SHRUGGED
DO
YOU
REMEMBER
THE
LAST
DESCRIPTION
OF
JAMES
TAGGART
SITTING
ON
THE
FLOOR
BESIDE
THE
FERRIS
PERSUADER
THIS
COMES
CLOSE
TO
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
WHAT
IS
MEANT
BY
HELL
IN
MY
CIRCLES
IF
THE
IMAGE
OF
FIRE
IS
OFTEN
USED
IN
THIS
CONNECTION
THERE
ARE
TWO
REASONS
THAT
OCCUR
TO
ME
THE
FIRST
REASON
IS
THAT
IT
CONVEYS
THE
IDEA
OF
HELL
AS
SOMETHING
THAT
ANY
RATIONAL
BEING
WOULD
EARNESTLY
WISH
TO
AVOID
AS
ANY
RATIONAL
BEING
WOULD
WISH
TO
AVOID
THE
FATE
OF
JAMES
TAGGART
BUT
THE
LATTER
IMAGE
IS
MEANINGFUL
ONLY
TO
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
READ
ATLAS
SHRUGGED
A
SMALLER
AUDIENCE
THAN
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
PLAYED
WITH
MATCHES
THE
SECOND
REASON
IS
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
HEBREW
WORD
GEHENNA
ONE
OF
THE
WORDS
TRANSLATED
HELL
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
IT
REFERS
TO
THE
VALLEY
OF
HINNON
OUTSIDE
JERUSALEM
IN
EARLY
DAYS
IT
WAS
A
PLACE
WHERE
THE
CANAANITES
OFFERED
HUMAN
SACRIFICES
BURNED
ALIVE
TO
MOLECH
LATER
IT
WAS
MADE
A
GARBAGE
OR
REFUSE
DUMP
WHERE
FIRES
BURNED
CONTINUALLY
CONSUMING
THE
TRASH
OF
THE
CITY
OF
JERUSALEM
TO
BE
CAST
INTO
GEHENNA
OR
TO
BURN
IN
GEHENNA
THUS
BECAME
A
METAPHOR
FOR
TO
BE
REJECTED
OR
DISCARDED
AS
WORTHLESS
LEST
YOU
THINK
THAT
IDENTIFYING
HELL
WITH
THE
FATE
OF
JAMES
TAGGART
IS
MY
OWN
PRIVATE
FANCY
I
COMMEND
TO
YOU
THE
BOOK
THE
GREAT
DIVORCE
BY
C
S
LEWIS
IT
DISCUSSES
HEAVEN
NO
HARPS
AND
HELL
NO
FLAMES
IT
IS
SHORTER
THAN
ATLAS
SHRUGGED
AND
AVAILABLE
AT
MOST
BOOKSTORES
AND
LIBRARIES
YOURS
JAMES
