AFTERLIFE
HERE
IS
ANOTHER
WAY
OF
LOOKING
AT
IT
WHEN
WE
DIE
WE
ARE
RELEASED
FROM
THE
ARC
OF
TIME
AND
ABLE
TO
COMPREHEND
OUR
LIVES
IN
TOTO
TO
VISIT
EACH
MOMENT
IN
TIME
SEQUENTIALLY
OR
ALL
AT
ONCE
BUT
NOT
ABLE
TO
ALTER
THE
ACTIONS
THOUGHTS
OR
FEELINGS
WE
HADHAVEWILL
HAVE
IN
THIS
LIFE
FROM
THAT
PERSPECTIVE
I
POSIT
THAT
ALL
WILL
HAVE
DIRECT
KNOWLEDGE
OF
GOD
AND
BE
ABLE
TO
RECOGNIZE
AT
EACH
MOMENT
OF
TIME
WETHER
WE
WERE
DOING
WHAT
WE
OUGHT
THAT
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
HAVING
LIVED
A
LIFE
FAR
FROM
GOD
WILL
BE
AN
ETERNAL
TORMENT
THAT
HAVING
LIVED
A
LIFE
OF
GRACE
WILL
BE
AN
ETERNAL
JOY
THAT
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
BODY
COMES
NOT
FROM
ANY
PHYSICAL
RECONSTITUTION
OF
OUR
PRESENT
FORMS
BUT
KNOWLEDGE
OF
OUR
PRESENT
FORMS
BY
OUR
FULLY
COGNIZANT
SOULS
AS
AN
ASIDE
IF
WE
WERE
TO
BE
RESTRICTED
FOR
ALL
TIME
TO
OUR
PRESENT
FORM
WOULD
YOU
OPT
FOR
IMMORTALITY
