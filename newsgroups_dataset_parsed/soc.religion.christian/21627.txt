RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
THEREFORE
UNTIL
SOMEONE
IS
CAPABLE
OF
COMPREHENDING
GODS
LAWS
THEY
ARE
NOT
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
LIVING
THEM
THEY
ARE
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
LIFE
AND
ARE
NOT
REMOVED
UNTIL
THEY
CAN
MAKE
A
CONSCIOUS
DECISION
TO
DISOBEY
GOD
A
IDLER
IF
BABIES
ARE
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
BAPTISED
THEN
WHY
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
EVER
SAY
SO
IT
NEVER
COMES
RIGHT
AND
SAYS
ONLY
PEOPLE
THAT
KNOW
RIGHT
FROM
WRONG
OR
WHO
ARE
TAUGHT
CAN
BE
BAPTISED
WHAT
CHRIST
DID
SAY
WAS
I
SOLEMLY
ASSURE
YOU
NO
ONE
CAN
ENTER
GODS
KINGDOM
WITHOUT
BEING
BORN
OF
WATER
AND
SPIRIT
DO
NOT
BE
SURPRISED
THAT
I
TELL
YOU
YOU
MUST
ALL
BE
BEGOTTEN
FROM
ABOVE
COULD
THIS
BE
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
IS
BORN
WITH
ORIGINAL
SIN
IN
SOME
EARLIER
DISCUSSIONS
ON
THIS
THREAD
I
MAY
HAVE
GIVEN
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
EVEN
THOUGH
CHILDREN
DIDNT
REQUIRE
BAPTISM
IT
WOULDNT
HURT
IF
THEY
WERE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
WHEN
YOU
BAPTIZE
CHILDREN
BEFORE
THEY
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
COMPREHENDING
IT
YOU
DENY
THEM
THEIR
OPPORTUNITY
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THEIR
DESIRE
TO
SERVE
GOD
HAVE
ANY
OF
YOU
CONSIDERED
THAT
CHILDREN
ARE
NOT
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
SIN
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
REPENTANCE
PETER
SAID
TO
A
GROUP
OF
MEN
AND
BRETHREN
REPENT
AND
BE
BAPTIZED
EVERY
ONE
OF
YOU
ACTS
NOTICE
THAT
HE
SPECIFIED
THAT
IF
THEY
REPENT
THEN
THEY
MAY
BE
BAPTIZED
IN
FOLLOWING
PETERS
INSTRUCTIONS
PEOPLE
MUST
FIRST
DEMONSTRATE
REPENTANCE
A
FORSAKING
OF
THEIR
SINS
AND
A
DESIRE
TO
OBEY
GODS
COMMANDS
BEFORE
THEY
ARE
ELIGIBLE
TO
BE
BAPTIZED
SINCE
YOUNG
CHILDREN
ARE
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
REPENTING
THEY
ARE
NOT
ELIGIBLE
FOR
BAPTISM
AND
SINCE
GOD
IS
BOTH
JUST
AND
MERCIFUL
SIN
IS
NOT
IMPUTED
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
ROMANS
YOUNG
CHILDREN
ARE
NOT
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
WHAT
THEY
CANT
COMPREHEND
A
IDLER
