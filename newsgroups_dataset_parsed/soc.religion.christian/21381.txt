RE
HOMOSEXUALITY
ISSUES
IN
CHRISTIANI
ANY
ONE
WHO
THINKS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
CHRISTIANITY
ARE
COMPATIBLE
SHOULD
CK
OUT
ROMANS
I
CORINTHIANS
I
TIMOTHY
JUDE
II
PETER
GEN
LEV
TO
NAME
A
FEW
OF
THE
VERSES
THAT
PERTAIN
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
CHRISTS
LOVE
BRYAN
WHITSELL
I
WAS
WAITING
FOR
THIS
I
THINK
YOUR
QUESTION
SHOULD
BE
REPHRASED
THE
MANY
VERSES
OF
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
CONDEM
HOMOSEXUALITY
BY
OUR
BELIEFS
HAVE
BEEN
SHOVED
DOWN
THE
THROATS
OF
HOMOSEXUALS
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BY
WELLMEANING
CHRISTIANS
THE
QUESTION
IS
HOW
DO
THEY
INTERPRET
THESE
VERSES
ANY
DISCUSSION
OF
ANY
ISSUE
THIS
OR
ANY
OTHER
ISSUE
REQUIRES
A
PROOF
OF
YOUR
CASE
AS
WELL
AS
A
DISPROOF
OF
THE
OPPOSING
VIEW
WE
ARE
ALREADY
FAMILIAR
WITH
THOSE
VERSES
AND
MANY
HAVE
PROVEN
TO
THEMSELVES
THAT
THESE
CONDEM
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOUR
WE
MUST
NOW
ESTABLISH
REASONS
FOR
NOT
BELIEVING
THIS
TO
BE
TRUE
BASED
ON
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
THESE
SCRIPTURES
GIVEN
BY
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
COME
TO
GRIPS
WITH
THEM
TODD
