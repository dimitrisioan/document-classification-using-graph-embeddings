ANY
FORMER
ATHEISTS
CONVERTED
BY
ARGUMENT
THIS
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
QUESTION
AND
ILL
BE
ANXIOUS
TO
SEE
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
SUCH
CASES
I
DOUBT
IT
IN
THE
MEDIEVAL
PERIOD
ESP
WHEN
AQUINAS
FLOURISHED
ARGUMENT
WAS
A
USEFUL
TOOL
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
KNEW
THE
RULES
TODAY
WHEN
YOU
CANT
COUNT
ON
PEOPLE
KNOWING
EVEN
THE
BASICS
OF
LOGIC
OR
SEEING
THROUGH
RHETORIC
A
GOOD
ARGUMENT
IS
OFTEN
INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM
A
POOR
ONE
THE
LAST
SENTENCE
IS
IRONIC
SINCE
SO
MANY
READERS
OF
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
SEEM
TO
NOT
BE
EMBARRASSED
BY
APOLOGISTS
SUCH
AS
JOSH
MCDOWELL
AND
CS
LEWIS
I
HAVENT
FOLLOWED
WHATEVER
DISCUSSION
THERE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
ON
THESE
PEOPLE
BUT
I
FEEL
THAT
C
S
LEWIS
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
APOLOGIST
AND
I
SEE
NO
REASON
FOR
EMBARRASSMENT
IF
YOU
THINK
THAT
ERRORS
AND
FLAWED
ARGUMENTS
ARE
A
REASON
FOR
DISMISSING
A
THINKER
YOU
MUST
DISMISS
NEARLY
EVERY
THINKER
FROM
DESCARTES
TO
KANT
ANY
PHILOSOPHY
COURSE
WILL
INTRODUCE
YOU
TO
THEIR
WEAKNESSES
THE
ABOVE
ALSO
EXPRESSES
A
RATHER
ODD
SENSE
OF
HISTORY
WHAT
MAKES
YOU
THINK
THE
MASSES
IN
AQUINAS
DAY
WHO
WERE
MOSTLY
ILLITERATE
KNEW
ANY
MORE
ABOUT
RHETORIC
AND
LOGIC
THAN
MOST
PEOPLE
TODAY
IF
WRITINGS
FROM
THE
PERIOD
SEEM
ELEVATED
CONSIDER
THAT
ONLY
THE
CREAM
OF
THE
CROP
SO
TO
SPEAK
COULD
READ
AND
WRITE
IF
EVERYONE
IN
THE
MEDIEVAL
PERIOD
KNEW
THE
RULES
IT
WAS
A
MATTER
OF
UNCRITICALLY
ACCEPTING
WHAT
THEY
WERE
TOLD
I
SAID
NOTHING
ABOUT
THE
MASSES
HOWEVER
COMPARING
THE
MASSES
IN
OUR
DAY
AND
IN
AQUINAS
DAY
REALLY
IS
ODD
READ
ORTEGA
Y
GASSET
ON
THIS
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
FAMILIAR
EXPERIENCE
OF
ARGUING
ALL
NIGHT
AND
WINNING
ON
LOGIC
AND
EVIDENCE
ONLY
TO
DISCOVER
YOUR
OPPONENT
TO
BE
UNAWARE
EVEN
INTUITIVELY
OF
THINGS
LIKE
ENTAILMENT
LET
ALONE
PRAGMATICS
I
AM
ASSUMING
