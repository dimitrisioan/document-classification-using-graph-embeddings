ASSURANCE
OF
HELL
I
DREAMED
THAT
THE
GREAT
JUDGMENT
MORNING
HAD
DAWNED
AND
THE
TRUMPET
HAD
BLOWN
I
DREAMED
THAT
THE
SINNERS
HAD
GATHERED
FOR
JUDGMENT
BEFORE
THE
WHITE
THRONE
OH
WHAT
WEEPING
AND
WAILING
AS
THE
LOST
WERE
TOLD
OF
THEIR
FATE
THEY
CRIED
FOR
THE
ROCK
AND
THE
MOUNTAINS
THEY
PRAYED
BUT
THEIR
PRAYERS
WERE
TOO
LATE
THE
SOUL
THAT
HAD
PUT
OFF
SALVATION
NOT
TONIGHT
ILL
GET
SAVED
BY
AND
BY
NO
TIME
NOW
TO
THINK
OF
RELIGION
ALAS
HE
HAD
FOUND
TIME
TO
DIE
AND
I
SAW
A
GREAT
WHITE
THRONE
NOW
SOME
HAVE
PROTEST
BY
SAYING
THAT
THE
FEAR
OF
HELL
IS
NOT
GOOD
FOR
MOTIVATION
YET
JESUS
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
PAUL
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
PAUL
SAID
KNOWING
THEREFORE
THE
TERROR
OF
THE
LORD
WE
PERSUADE
MEN
TODAY
TOO
MUCH
OF
OUR
EVANGELISM
IS
NOTHING
BUT
SOFT
SOAP
AND
SOME
OF
IT
IS
NOTHING
BUT
EVANGELICAL
SALESMANSHIP
WE
DONT
TELL
PEOPLE
ANYMORE
THAT
THERES
SUCH
A
THING
AS
SIN
OR
THAT
THERES
SUCH
A
PLACE
AS
HELL
AS
JAYNE
HAS
SAID
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
WE
HAVE
TO
COME
ON
SO
STRONG
SO
AS
TO
HIT
PEOPLE
OVER
THE
HEAD
WITH
A
BASEBALL
BAT
YET
THE
FACT
REMAINS
THERE
IS
A
PLACE
CALLED
HELL
A
PLACE
SO
FEARFUL
THAT
GOD
DIED
TO
SAVE
US
FROM
HAVING
TO
EXPERIENCE
IT
WHATEVER
YOU
OR
I
AS
CHRISTIANS
DO
WE
SHOULD
DO
WHATEVER
WE
CAN
TO
WIN
PEOPLE
TO
THE
LORD
IF
FOR
NO
OTHER
REASON
TO
KEEP
THEM
FROM
GOING
TO
OUTER
DARKNESS
JESUS
IN
MT
TELLS
US
THAT
HE
DIDNT
PREPARE
HELL
FOR
PEOPLE
HE
PREPARED
IT
FOR
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
NO
WHERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
DO
I
READ
ANYWHERE
THAT
GOD
PREDESTINED
ANYBODY
TO
GO
TO
HELL
DL
MOODY
USE
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
ELECT
ARE
THE
WHOSOEVER
WILL
AND
THE
NONELECT
ARE
THE
WHOSOEVER
WONTS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THATS
THEOLOGICALLY
SOUND
I
COULDNT
DEFEND
BUT
ITS
PRACTICAL
JESUS
SAID
TO
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
YE
WOULD
NOT
NOW
SOME
OF
YOU
MAY
NOT
BE
STUDENTS
OF
THE
BIBLE
HECK
SOME
OF
YOU
MAY
NOT
BE
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
YOU
EVER
SAID
TO
SOMEBODY
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
HELL
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
RELIGION
OF
JESUS
BUT
DID
YOU
KNOW
THAT
JESUS
TALKED
MORE
ABOUT
HELL
THAN
HE
DID
ABOUT
HEAVEN
OH
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
RELIGION
OF
THE
SERMON
ON
THE
MOUNT
YOU
FIND
HELL
TAUGHT
BY
JESUS
IN
THE
SERMON
ON
THE
MOUNT
YOULL
READ
THAT
JESUS
TALKED
ABOUT
THE
TREE
BEING
CAST
INTO
THE
FIRE
SEVERAL
TIMES
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
HELL
AND
ABOUT
JUDGMENT
IN
FACT
OVER
AND
OVER
IN
THE
SYNOPTICS
MATTHEW
MARK
AND
LUKE
JESUS
TALKS
ABOUT
HELL
NOT
ISAIAH
NOT
MOSES
NOT
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
THOUGH
HE
DID
BUT
JESUS
THE
SON
OF
GOD
THE
GREAT
BELOVED
ONE
PREACHED
ABOUT
HELL
BECAUSE
HE
LOVED
PEOPLE
AND
DIDNT
WANT
TO
SEE
THEM
GO
THERE
NOW
IF
THERE
IS
NO
HELL
THEN
JESUS
PREACHED
IN
VAIN
IT
WAS
OUR
LORD
JESUS
NOT
SOME
ANGRY
BAPTIST
PREACHER
THAT
SAID
WHERE
THE
WORM
NEVER
DIES
AND
WHERE
THE
FIRE
NEVER
GOES
OUT
JESUS
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
JESUS
WHO
CALLED
HELL
A
FURNACE
OF
FIRE
IT
WAS
JESUS
THAT
USED
THE
WORD
CONDEMNATION
AND
THIS
IS
THE
CONDEMNATION
THAT
MEN
LOVE
DARKNESS
RATHER
THAN
LIGHT
BECAUSE
THEIR
DEEDS
ARE
EVIL
JESUS
SAID
THAT
HOW
CAN
WE
GET
IT
ACROSS
TO
YOU
THAT
A
LOVING
DYING
JESUS
PREACHED
ABOUT
HELL
NOT
ONLY
THAT
BUT
HE
WENT
THROUGH
HELL
THATS
WHAT
CALGARY
WAS
ALL
ABOUT
WHEN
MY
LORD
WAS
ON
THE
CROSS
DARKNESS
FELL
HE
CALLED
HELL
OUTER
DARKNESS
DO
YOU
HAVE
THIS
IDEA
THAT
HELL
IS
A
PLACE
WHERE
THE
GAMBLERS
ARE
GAMBLING
OVER
HERE
THE
DRUNKS
ARE
GETTING
DRUNK
OVER
THERE
AND
THE
PROSTITUTES
ARE
PROSTITUTING
THEIR
BODIES
OVER
THERE
THATS
NOT
WHAT
HELL
IS
HELLS
NOT
A
PARTY
THERES
NO
FELLOWSHIP
THERE
HE
CALLED
IT
OUTER
DARKNESS
OUTER
AWAY
FROM
GOD
DARKNESS
GOD
IS
LIGHT
NO
WHEN
HE
WAS
ON
THE
CROSS
HE
WAS
MADE
SIN
FOR
YOU
AND
FOR
ME
GOD
TREATED
JESUS
THE
WAY
SINNERS
HAVE
TO
BE
TREATED
THATS
IS
A
SOBERING
THOUGHT
AS
MY
SON
WOULD
SAY
AN
AWESOME
THOUGHT
MY
GOD
MY
GOD
WHY
HAST
THOU
FORSAKEN
ME
HELL
IS
ISOLATION
THERES
NO
FELLOWSHIP
IN
HELL
THERES
NO
FRIENDSHIP
IN
HELL
THERES
NO
LOVING
EMBRACE
IN
HELL
THERES
NO
HAND
SHAKE
IN
HELL
THERES
NO
WORD
OF
ENCOURAGEMENT
IN
HELL
I
THIRST
IT
GOES
MUCH
DEEPER
THAN
PHYSICAL
THIRST
HELL
IS
ETERNAL
CRAVING
WITH
NO
SATISFACTION
THE
MAN
WHOSE
LIFE
WAS
LIVED
FOR
DRUGS
WILL
CRAVE
IT
ETERNALLY
THE
MAN
WHOSE
LIFE
WAS
LIVED
FOR
THE
LUST
OF
A
WOMANS
BODY
WILL
CRAVE
IT
ETERNALLY
AND
NOT
BE
SATISFIED
ONE
THEOLOGIAN
HAS
PUT
IT
THIS
WAY
AND
I
THINK
IT
DESERVES
MERIT
WHAT
IS
HELL
HELL
IS
JUST
THE
KIND
OF
ENVIRONMENT
THAT
MATCHES
THE
INTERNAL
CONDITION
OF
THE
LOST
IN
A
RECENT
POST
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
REMEMBER
THE
FOUNDER
OF
THE
WORD
OF
LIFE
MINISTRIES
IVE
REMEMBERED
HIS
NAME
JACK
WERTZEN
AND
FOUND
THAT
THE
ILLUSTRATION
THAT
I
GAVE
WASNT
HIS
HIS
ILLUSTRATION
WAS
THAT
HE
WAS
TALKING
TO
HIS
BARBER
AND
HIS
BARBERS
WIFE
AND
DAUGHTER
HAD
JUST
RECENTLY
BEEN
SAVED
AND
HE
WAS
COMMENTING
ABOUT
IT
TO
JACK
THEY
SING
THESE
SONGS
AND
READ
BIBLE
VERSES
AND
THEIR
PRAISING
THIS
AND
THAT
I
CANT
STAND
IT
JACK
DO
YOU
THINK
GOD
WOULD
SEND
ME
TO
HELL
JACK
ANSWERED
BY
SAYING
YES
I
THINK
HE
WOULD
OF
COURSE
THE
BARBER
SAID
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
THAT
WELL
IF
YOU
CANT
STAND
LIVING
AT
HOME
WITH
YOUR
WIFE
AND
DAUGHTER
WHO
SING
HYMNS
AND
PRAISES
TO
GOD
NOW
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
IN
HEAVEN
WHERE
THEYLL
DO
IT
FOR
ETERNITY
YOUD
BE
MISERABLE
BECAUSE
GOD
LOVES
YOU
HED
PUT
YOU
WHERE
IT
WOULD
MATCH
WHAT
YOU
REALLY
ARE
IT
MAKES
A
MAN
THINK
THE
CRUCIFIXION
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
A
FACT
THAT
NECESSITATES
THE
ETERNAL
EXISTENCE
OF
HELL
BECAUSE
ON
THE
CROSS
HE
PERFORMED
AN
ETERNAL
ACT
DONT
ASK
ME
HOW
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
HE
IS
GOD
AND
HE
IS
THE
INFINITEETERNAL
AND
WHEN
HE
DIED
HE
DIED
AN
INFINITEETERNAL
DEATH
IT
IS
BY
THAT
ETERNAL
ACT
THAT
HE
PURCHASED
ETERNAL
LIFE
FOR
THE
WHOSOEVER
WILLS
HE
SUFFERED
ETERNAL
JUDGMENT
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DETOUR
AROUND
HELL
BY
SAYING
EVERYBODY
IS
GOING
TO
BE
SAVED
EVENTUALLY
UNIVERSALISM
MY
BIBLE
SAYS
NO
HELL
SEPARATE
THEM
THE
SHEEP
FROM
THE
GOATS
AFTER
YOU
DIE
THERES
A
PROBATIONARY
PERIOD
IN
WHICH
GOD
PREPARES
YOU
FOR
HEAVEN
NO
MY
BIBLE
SAYS
THAT
IT
IS
APPOINTED
UNTO
MEN
ONCE
TO
DIE
AND
THEN
COMES
JUDGMENT
SOME
OF
THE
CULTIST
BELIEVE
IN
ANNIHILATION
AFTER
YOU
DIE
SSSSWISH
JUST
LIKE
A
MOSQUITO
YOURE
SQUISHED
OUT
NO
IN
REV
WE
ARE
TOLD
THAT
THEIR
IS
ETERNAL
EXISTENCE
IN
HELL
JUST
AS
THERE
IS
IN
HEAVEN
I
DONT
ENJOY
MAKING
THESE
KIND
OF
STATEMENTS
AND
MAYBE
YOU
DONT
ENJOY
LISTENING
TO
THEM
BUT
WE
HAVE
TO
PREACH
THE
ENTIRE
WORD
OF
GOD
THERE
IS
A
PLACE
CALLED
HELL
IF
I
COULD
GIVE
ONE
VERSE
OF
SCRIPTURE
THAT
COULD
GIVE
ANY
HOPE
THAT
PEOPLE
ARENT
GOING
THERE
ID
GIVE
IT
TO
YOU
BUT
I
HAVENT
FOUND
IT
THAT
FACT
THAT
THERE
IS
A
PLACE
CALLED
HELL
THE
FACT
THAT
OUR
GOD
IS
A
GOD
OF
HOLINESS
AND
MUST
JUDGE
SIN
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
HAS
MADE
US
THE
KIND
OF
CREATURES
WE
ARE
AND
THEREFORE
WERE
RESPONSIBLE
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
HAS
PLACED
US
IN
A
UNIVERSE
THAT
HAS
PURPOSE
AND
DESIGN
BEHIND
IT
THE
FACT
THAT
SIN
IS
SUCH
AN
AWFUL
THING
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
GOD
HIMSELF
WENT
THROUGH
HELL
TO
SAVE
US
FROM
HELL
LEADS
US
TO
TWO
APPLICATIONS
AS
IVE
ALREADY
MENTIONED
IF
YOU
ARE
A
CHRISTIAN
YOU
MUST
WORN
OTHERS
ITS
NOT
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
STOP
AND
FIX
THEIR
FLAT
TIRE
AND
NOT
TELL
THEM
THAT
JUST
AROUND
THE
BEND
THE
BRIDGE
IS
OUT
KNOWING
THEREFORE
THE
TERROR
OF
LORD
WE
PERSUADE
MEN
IF
YOU
HAVENT
ACCEPTED
JESUS
ARE
YOUR
SAVIOR
YOURE
TAKING
AN
AWFUL
CHANCE
AS
I
SAY
TO
THE
JEHOVAH
WITNESSES
WHO
NO
LONGER
FREQUENT
MY
DOOR
IF
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
AND
I
AM
WRONG
THEN
I
WILL
HAVE
LIVED
A
GOOD
LIFE
AND
WILL
DIE
AND
CEASE
TO
EXIST
BUT
IF
I
AM
RIGHT
AND
YOU
ARE
WRONG
THEN
YOU
WILL
DIE
AND
SUFFER
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
MAKE
FUN
AT
THIS
POINT
BUT
ITS
LIKE
DIRTY
HARRY
SAID
YOUVE
GOT
TO
ASK
YOURSELF
DO
I
FEEL
LUCKY
WELL
DO
YOU
A
MANS
GOT
TO
KNOW
HIS
LIMITATIONS
DONT
BE
ONE
OF
THE
WHOSOEVER
WONTS
BECAUSE
WHILE
I
WAS
YET
A
SINNER
HE
DIED
FOR
ME
THERES
NO
GREATER
LOVE
THAN
THIS
THAT
A
MAN
LAY
DOWN
HIS
LIFE
FOR
ANOTHER
REX
