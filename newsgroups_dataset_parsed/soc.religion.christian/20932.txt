being
right
about
messiahs

writes
and
from
my
meagre
knowledge
of
the
bible
it
seems
that
christians
have
been
hard
on
the
jews
of
christs
day
for
being
cautious
about
accepting
somebody
that
their
religious
authorities
didnt
accept
as
the
messiah
this
is
a
good
point
christ
was
hardly
the
only
person
who
claimed
to
be
the
messiahin
fact
a
number
of
messiahs
were
active
in
the
area
from
the
time
of
the
roman
conquest
to
after
the
fall
of
masada
many
of
the
statements
made
by
the
apostlesespecially
their
repeated
attempts
to
give
jesus
a
sword
give
him
military
power
point
to
the
fact
that
they
didnt
realize
the
true
nature
of
his
reign
until
after
the
fact
many
of
the
statements
in
the
bible
can
be
seen
as
being
oriented
toward
explaining
this
new
definition
of
messiah
to
the
jews
who
were
being
preached
