REFERRING
TO
MARY
SHE
WAS
IMMACULATELY
CONCEIVED
AND
SO
NEVER
SUBJECT
TO
ORIGINAL
SIN
BUT
ALSO
NEVER
COMMITTED
A
PERSONAL
SIN
IN
HER
WHOLE
LIFE
THIS
WAS
POSSIBLE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SPECIAL
DEGREE
OF
GRACE
GRANTED
TO
HER
BY
GOD
I
HAVE
QUITE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
IDEA
THAT
MARY
NEVER
COMMITTED
A
SIN
WAS
MARY
FULLY
HUMAN
IF
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
GOD
TO
MIRACULOUSLY
MAKE
A
PERSON
FREE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
AND
FREE
OF
COMMITTING
SIN
THEIR
WHOLE
LIFE
THEN
WHAT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
INCARNATION
OF
JESUS
WHY
CANT
GOD
JUST
REPEAT
THE
MIRACLE
DONE
FOR
MARY
TO
MAKE
ALL
THE
REST
OF
US
SINLESS
WITHOUT
THE
NEED
FOR
REPENTANCE
AND
SALVATION
AND
ALL
THAT
CONCEPT
OF
MARYS
SINLESSNESS
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
BE
AT
ODDS
WITH
THE
REST
OF
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
ITS
ALWAYS
A
TWOWAY
STREET
GOD
GAVE
HER
THE
GRACE
TO
AVOID
SIN
THUS
WHEN
SHE
WAS
VISITED
BY
GABRIEL
SHE
GAVE
HER
FIAT
HER
TOTAL
ACCEPTANCE
OF
GODS
WILL
THIS
FIAT
SUMMARIZES
WHY
CATHOLICS
REGARD
HER
AS
THE
HIGHEST
OF
ALL
HUMANS
THAT
GOD
CHOSE
HER
AND
THAT
SHE
ACCEPTED
KNOWING
THIS
IN
ADVANCE
WE
EXTRAPOLATE
THAT
SHE
WAS
NEITHER
STAINED
BY
NOR
SUBJECT
TO
ORIGINAL
SIN
GOD
DID
CREATE
US
ALL
MIRACULOUSLY
FREE
TO
CHOOSE
OR
NOT
CHOOSE
TO
SIN
SUFFICIENT
FOR
THE
DAY
IS
THE
EVIL
THEREOF
AND
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
TO
COMMAND
IT
THIS
AMOUNT
OF
GRACE
WAS
PRECISELY
DETERMINED
BY
GOD
TO
BE
THE
AMOUNT
REQUIRED
TO
DO
WHAT
GOD
ASKED
OF
HER
THE
GRACE
GIVEN
TO
EACH
OF
US
IS
ALSO
ENOUGH
BUT
WE
DO
NOT
ALWAYS
CHOOSE
TO
ACCEPT
IT
WE
ALSO
BELIEVE
JESUS
WAS
FULLY
HUMAN
AND
NEVER
SINNED
GOD
COULD
HAVE
CREATED
A
MUCH
BETTER
PERSON
THAN
MYSELF
ONE
WHO
ALWAYS
CHOSE
THE
RIGHT
THING
YET
HE
CREATED
ME
INSTEAD
DESPITE
MY
FLAWS
HE
PROVES
HE
LOVES
ME
AS
I
AM
CONTINUALLY
DRAWING
ME
TOWARDS
PERFECTION
FOR
WHATEVER
PURPOSE
HE
HAS
FOR
ME
HE
HAS
CONFIDENCE
THAT
I
WILL
ACCOMPLISH
IT
IF
I
ASK
GOD
TO
REPEAT
HIS
MIRACULOUS
CREATION
OF
THE
MOTHER
OF
HIS
SON
WHERE
WILL
THAT
LEAVE
ME
