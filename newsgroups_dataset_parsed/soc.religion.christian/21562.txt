you
might
visit
some
congregations
of
christians
who
happen
to
be
homosexuals
that
are
spiritfilled
believers
not
mccrs
before
you
go
lumping
us
all
together
with
troy
perry
gee
i
think
there
are
some
real
criminals
robbers
muderers
drug
addicts
who
appear
to
be
fun
loving
caring
people
too
so
whats
your
point
is
it
ok
just
because
the
people
are
nice
the
point
is
not
about
being
nice
nice
is
not
a
christian
virtue
the
point
is
that
the
gifts
and
fruits
of
the
spirit
by
their
fruits
you
shall
know
them
mt
are
manifested
by
and
among
prayerful
spiritfilled
gay
christians
it
was
the
manifestation
of
the
spirit
among
the
gentiles
that
convinced
peter
acts
that
his
prejudice
against
them
based
on
scripture
i
might
add
was
not
in
accordance
with
gods
intentions
i
think
the
old
saying
hate
the
sin
and
not
the
sinner
is
appropriate
here
many
who
belive
homosexuality
is
wrong
probably
dont
hate
the
people
i
dont
i
dont
hate
my
kids
when
they
do
wrong
either
but
i
tell
them
what
is
right
and
if
they
lie
or
dont
admit
they
are
wrong
or
just
dont
make
an
effort
to
improve
or
repent
they
get
punished
i
think
this
is
quite
appropriate
you
may
want
to
be
careful
about
how
you
think
satan
is
working
here
maybe
he
is
trying
to
destroy
our
sense
of
right
and
wrong
through
feel
goodism
maybe
he
is
trying
to
convince
you
that
you
know
more
than
god
kind
of
like
the
adam
and
eve
story
read
it
and
compare
it
to
todays
mentality
you
may
be
suprised
of
course
the
whole
issue
is
one
of
discernment
it
may
be
that
satan
is
trying
to
convince
us
that
we
know
more
than
god
or
it
may
be
that
god
is
trying
as
god
did
with
peter
to
teach
us
something
we
dont
know
that
god
shows
no
partiality
but
in
every
nation
anyone
who
fears
him
and
does
what
is
right
is
acceptable
to
him
acts
