ETYMOLOGY
OF
EASTER
FOR
SRC
IN
MOST
LANGUAGES
THE
FEAST
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
OUR
LORD
IS
KNOWN
AS
THE
PASCH
OR
PASQUE
OR
SOME
VARIATION
THEREOF
A
WORD
WHICH
COMES
FROM
THE
HEBREW
PESACH
MEANING
PASSOVER
IN
ENGLISH
GERMAN
AND
A
FEW
RELATED
LANGUAGES
HOWEVER
IT
IS
KNOWN
AS
EASTER
OR
SOME
VARIATION
THEREOF
AND
QUESTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
ASKED
ABOUT
THE
ORIGIN
OF
THIS
TERM
ONE
EXPLANATION
IS
THAT
GIVEN
BY
THE
VENERABLE
BEDE
IN
HIS
DE
RATIONE
TEMPORUM
WHERE
HE
DERIVES
THE
WORD
FROM
THE
NAME
OF
AN
ANGLOSAXON
GODDESS
OF
SPRING
CALLED
EASTRE
BEDE
IS
A
GREAT
SCHOLAR
AND
IT
IS
NATURAL
TO
TAKE
HIS
WORD
FOR
IT
BUT
HE
LIVED
AND
AUGUSTINE
BEGAN
PREACHING
IN
KENT
IN
THE
USE
OF
THE
WORD
EASTER
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
FEAST
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
WELL
ESTABLISHED
BEFORE
THE
BIRTH
OF
BEDE
AND
PROBABLY
BEFORE
THE
BIRTH
OF
ANYONE
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
DISCUSSED
THE
SUBJECT
WITH
IT
SEEMS
LIKELY
THAT
HIS
DERIVATION
IS
JUST
A
GUESS
BASED
ON
HIS
AWARENESS
THAT
THERE
HAD
BEEN
AN
ANGLOSAXON
GODDESS
OF
SPRING
BEARING
THAT
NAME
AND
THE
RESEMBLANCE
OF
THE
WORDS
THUS
IF
THE
SAID
RESEMBLANCE
SURELY
IT
IS
NOT
SURPRISING
THAT
A
PERSONIFICATION
OF
SPRING
SHOULD
HAVE
A
NAME
SIMILAR
TO
THE
WORD
FOR
DAWN
IS
NOT
IN
ISTELF
CONVINCING
THE
TESTIMONY
OR
RATHER
THE
CONJECTURE
BY
BEDE
DOES
NOT
MAKE
IT
MORE
SO
ASSUMING
THAT
BEDE
WAS
RIGHT
THAT
WOULD
NOT
JUSTIFY
SAYING
THAT
THE
CHRISTIAN
CELEBRATION
WHICH
AFTER
ALL
HAD
BEEN
GOING
ON
FOR
SOME
CENTURIES
BEFORE
THE
NAME
EASTER
WAS
APPLIED
TO
IT
HAS
PAGAN
ROOTS
IT
WOULD
SIMPLY
MEAN
THAT
THE
ANGLOSAXONS
UPON
BECOMING
CHRISTIANS
AND
BEGINNING
TO
CELEBRATE
THE
RESURRECTION
BY
A
FESTIVAL
EVERY
SPRING
CALLED
IT
BY
THE
NAME
THAT
TO
THEM
MEANT
SIMPLY
SPRING
FESTIVAL
HOWEVER
BEDES
IS
NOT
THE
ONLY
THEORY
THAT
HAS
BEEN
PROPOSED
J
KNOBLECH
IN
DIE
SPRACH
ZEITSCHRIFT
FUER
SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT
VIENNA
OFFERS
THE
FOLLOWING
DERIVATION
AMONG
LATINSPEAKING
CHRISTIANS
THE
WEEK
BEGINNING
WITH
THE
FEAST
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
WAS
KNOWN
AS
HEBDOMADA
ALBA
WHITE
WEEK
SINCE
THE
NEWLYBAPTIZED
CHRISTIANS
WERE
ACCUSTOMED
TO
WEAR
THEIR
WHITE
BAPTISMAL
ROBES
THROUGHOUT
THAT
WEEK
SOMETIMES
THE
WEEK
WAS
REFERRED
TO
SIMPLY
AS
ALBAE
TRANSLATERS
RENDERING
THIS
INTO
GERMAN
MISTOOK
IT
FOR
THE
PLURAL
OF
ALBA
MEANING
DAWN
THEY
ACCORDINGLY
RENDERED
IT
AS
EOSTARUM
WHICH
IS
OLD
HIGH
GERMAN
FOR
DAWN
THIS
GAVE
RISE
TO
THE
FORM
EASTER
IN
ENGLISH

NO
IM
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
RESTARTING
DISCUSSIONS
OF
THE
PROPRIETY
OF
CELEBRATING
EASTER

IT
CONTAINS
