REASON
AND
HOMOPHOBIA
THIS
HAS
TROUBLED
ME
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
AND
NEEDS
TO
BE
DEALT
WITH
FROM
A
LONG
ARTICLE
AVAILABLE
THROUGH
AN
INDIVIDUAL
ON
THIS
NEWSGROUP
ABOUT
SCRIPTURE
BEING
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALITY
WHEN
WE
ARE
LESS
HOMOPHOBIC
WE
WILL
SEE
THAT
WHAT
WE
KNOW
AS
GAY
AND
LESBIAN
PEOPLE
ENGAGING
IN
LOVING
VOLUNTARY
EROTIC
RELATIONS
WITH
EACH
OTHER
ARENT
EVEN
MENTIONED
IN
THE
BIBLE
TK
THIS
FRIGHTENS
ME
NOT
IN
THE
HOMOPHOBIC
SENSE
BUT
INTELLECTUALLY
ESPECIALLY
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
WRITTEN
BY
SOMEONE
FROM
A
HOMOSEXUAL
CHURCH
SO
IF
MY
INTERPRETATION
IS
DIFFERENT
THAN
THEIRS
I
AM
HOMOPHOBIC
THIS
CANT
BE
RIGHT
DISAGREEMENT
IN
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
BIBLE
ANDOR
REJECTION
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
ACTS
IS
NOT
TANTAMOUNT
OF
HOMOPHOBIA
