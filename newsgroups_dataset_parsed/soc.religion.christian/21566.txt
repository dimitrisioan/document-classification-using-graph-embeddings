RE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
ESP
SIRACH
WHAT
WE
CALL
TODAY
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
WAS
BEING
WRITTEN
UP
TO
APPROX
IMATELY
BCE
ACCORDING
TO
MOST
MODERN
SCHOLARS
ASIDE
FROM
THE
BOOK
OF
DANIEL
THE
WHOLE
OT
PREDATES
ALEXANDER
THE
GREAT
THESE
BOOKS
WERE
WRITTEN
PREDOMINANTLY
IN
HEBREW
THERE
WERE
ALSO
OTHER
BOOKS
BEING
WRITTEN
AT
ABOUT
THIS
TIME
AND
LATER
BY
GREEKSPEAKING
OR
HELLENISTIC
JEWS
THESE
BOOKS
ARE
THOSE
WHICH
ARE
RECKONED
BY
MANY
DENOMINATIONS
AS
APOCRYPHA
BEFORE
THE
CLOSING
OF
THE
WRITINGS
THE
THIRD
PART
OF
WHAT
IS
TODAY
CALLED
THE
CANON
ALL
OF
THE
BOOKS
WERE
IN
USE
BY
JEWS
OF
THE
DAY
HOWEVER
THERE
WERE
THOSE
WHO
RECKONED
BASED
ON
ZECH
THAT
PROPHECY
HAD
CEASED
THIS
FACTION
MAINTAINED
THAT
THERE
WERE
NO
TRUE
PROPHETS
IN
THEIR
DAY
THEY
ALSO
MAINTAINED
THAT
LITERATURE
OF
A
PROPHETIC
CHARACTER
COULD
NOT
BE
GENUINE
TEACHINGS
FROM
GOD
BY
THE
TIME
OF
CE
ANOTHER
FACTION
HAD
ENTERED
THE
MESS
CHRISTIANS
HAD
COME
IN
CLAIMING
THAT
THEIR
WRITINGS
WERE
ALSO
SUITABLE
TO
BE
READ
IN
SYNAGOGUES
AND
USED
FOR
WORSHIP
THEREFORE
THE
PALESTINIAN
JEWISH
LEADERS
GOT
TOGETHER
AND
STATED
THAT
THE
BOOKS
WRITTEN
FROM
THE
TIME
OF
BEN
SIRA
SIRACH
ONWARD
WERE
NOT
SACRED
WRITINGS
THEY
JUSTIFIED
THIS
FROM
ZECH
IN
PARTICULAR
THEY
SAID
THE
WRITINGS
OF
THE
CHRISTIANS
CALLED
HERETICS
WERE
NOT
INSPIRED
AT
ABOUT
CE
THEY
CODIFIED
THINGS
FURTHER
BY
CLOSING
THE
CANON
IN
SOMEWHAT
OF
AN
OFFICIAL
SENSE
AT
THE
COUNCIL
OF
JAMNIA
A
FEW
BOOKS
ECCLESI
ASTES
SONG
OF
SONGS
ESTHER
MADE
IT
IN
AFTER
THAT
DATE
BUT
THESE
WERE
THOSE
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
WRITTEN
PRIOR
TO
THE
OFFICIAL
CUT
OFF
POINT
THE
TIME
OF
BEN
SIRA
FOR
INCLUSION
THAT
THEY
HAD
ESTABLISHED
IN
ORDER
TO
KEEP
OUT
THE
CHRISTIAN
AND
HELLENISTIC
WRITINGS
JEROME
EXCLUDED
THE
APOCRYPHA
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
NOT
IN
USE
BY
JEWS
OF
HIS
DAY
AND
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
EXCEPT
FOR
SIRACH
NOT
FOUND
IN
HEBREW
IN
HIS
TIME
HIS
CRITERION
FOR
SEPARATING
THEM
FROM
THE
OTHER
PRECHRISTIAN
WRITINGS
WAS
NOT
BASED
ON
INSPIRATION
THERE
IS
PLENTY
MORE
TO
SAY
BUT
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
TIME
THE
PASSAGE
