LOSING
YOUR
TEMPER
IS
NOT
A
CHRISTIAN
TRAIT
COMING
FROM
A
LONG
LINE
OF
HOT
TEMPERED
PEOPLE
I
KNOW
TEMPER
WHEN
I
SEE
IT
ONE
OF
THE
TELL
TALE
SIGNSFRUITS
THAT
GIVE
NONCHRISTIANS
AWAY
IS
WHEN
THEIR
NET
REPLIES
ARE
ACRID
ANGRY
AND
SARCASTIC
WE
IN
THE
NET
VILLAGE
DO
HAVE
A
LAUGH
OR
TWO
WHEN
PROFESSED
BORN
AGAIN
CHRISTIANS
VERBALLY
ATTACK
PEOPLE
WHO
MIGHT
OTHERWISE
HAVE
BEEN
WON
TO
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HAD
ORIGINALLY
JOINED
THE
DISCUSSIONS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
SPIRITUALLY
HUNGRY
INSTEAD
OF
ANSWERING
QUESTIONS
WITH
SWEETNESS
AND
SINCERITY
THESE
CHRISITAN
NETWARRIORS
FLAME
THE
QUERIES
YOU
DONT
NEED
ANY
ENEMIES
YOU
ALREADY
DO
YOURSELVES
THE
GREATEST
HARM
AGAIN
I
SAY
FOOLISH
FOOLISH
FOOLISH
