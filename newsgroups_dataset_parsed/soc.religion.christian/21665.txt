RE
ON
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
RANDAL
LEE
NICHOLAS
MANDOCK
WRITES
REGARDING
THE
NEW
DRAFT
OF
THE
UNIVERSAL
CATECHISM
IN
PROCURING
THE
COMMON
GOOD
OF
SOCIETY
THE
NEED
COULD
ARISE
THAT
THE
AGGRESSOR
BE
PLACED
IN
THE
POSITION
WHERE
HE
CANNOT
CAUSE
HARM
BY
VIRTUE
OF
THIS
THE
RIGHT
AND
OBLIGATION
OF
PUBLIC
AUTHORITIES
TO
PUNISH
WITH
PROPORTIONATE
PENALTIES
INCLUDING
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
IS
ACKNOWLEDGED
TO
THE
DEGREE
THAT
MEANS
OTHER
THAN
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
AND
MILITARY
OPERATIONS
ARE
SUFFICIENT
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
THEN
THESE
NONVIOLENT
PROVISIONS
ARE
TO
BE
PREFERRED
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
MORE
IN
PROPORTION
AND
IN
KEEPING
WITH
THE
FINAL
GOAL
OF
PROTECTION
OF
PEACE
AND
HUMAN
DIGNITY
EXACTLY
READ
THAT
ONE
SENTENCE
IN
THERETO
THE
DEGREE
THAT
MEANS
OTHER
THAN
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
AND
MILITARY
OPERATIONS
ARE
SUFFICIENT
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
THEN
THESE
NONVIOLENT
PROVISIONS
ARE
TO
BE
PREFERRED
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
US
TO
MURDER
CRIMINALS
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
THE
CHURCH
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
FEELS
THE
SAME
WAY
THUS
THE
REASON
THAT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
HAS
OPPOSED
EVERY
EXECUTION
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
IN
RECENT
MEMORY
AS
IS
CLEARLY
SHOWN
BY
THIS
EXCERPT
THE
CHURCHS
TEACHING
ON
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
REMAINS
TODAY
AS
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
IN
THE
PAST
IN
TOTAL
ACCORD
WITH
MY
SENTIMENT
THAT
I
DO
NOT
DISAGREE
WITH
THE
USE
OF
DEADLY
FORCE
IN
THOSE
CASES
FOR
WHICH
THIS
OPTION
IS
JUSTIFIABLE
SO
WHAT
IS
JUSTIFIABLE
AS
YOU
STATED
VERY
EXPLICITLY
FROM
THE
NEW
CATECHISM
THE
ONLY
JUSTIFIABLE
CASE
IS
WHEN
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
SINCE
THAT
DOES
NOT
APPLY
AT
ALL
TO
THIS
COUNTRY
THE
LOGICAL
CONCLUSION
BASED
ON
YOUR
OWN
PREMISES
IS
THAT
ONE
MUST
BE
OPPOSED
TO
ANY
FORM
OF
CAPITAL
PUNISHMENT
IN
AMERICA
JUST
MY
OPINIONS
