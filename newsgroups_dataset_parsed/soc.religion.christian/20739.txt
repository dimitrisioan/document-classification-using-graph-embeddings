TIMOTHY
J
BRENT
WRITES
I
HAVE
STATED
BEFORE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
MYSELF
AN
ATHEIST
BUT
SO
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
ONE
CREATOR
I
ASSUME
DEFINITELY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
COMBINED
WITH
A
POST
TO
ANOTHER
GROUP
TO
THE
EFFECT
OF
YOU
WILL
ALL
GO
TO
HELL
HAS
ME
INTERESTED
IN
THE
CONSENSUS
AS
TO
HOW
A
GOD
MIGHT
JUDGE
MEN
AS
A
CATHOLIC
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
A
JEW
BUDDHIST
ETC
MIGHT
GO
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
OBVIOUSLY
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THIS
EVEN
MORE
SEE
ATHEISTS
AND
PAGANS
I
ASSUME
I
WOULD
BE
LUMPED
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
TO
BE
HELLBOUND
I
KNOW
YOU
BELIEVE
ONLY
GOD
CAN
JUDGE
AND
I
DO
NOT
ASK
YOU
TO
JUST
FOR
YOUR
OPINIONS
OK
GOD
HAS
THE
DISCLAIMER
RESERVES
THE
RIGHT
TO
JUDGE
INDIVIDUAL
CASES
IF
WE
BELIEVE
HIM
TO
BE
LOVING
THEN
WE
ALSO
BELIEVE
HIM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SERVE
JUSTICE
TO
ALL
DONT
WORRY
IF
A
JEW
OR
ATHIEST
IS
GOING
TO
HEAVEN
OR
HELL
FOR
THAT
IS
GOD
TO
JUDGE
ALTHOUGH
TRULY
IF
YOU
WERE
CONCERNED
YOU
COULD
ONLY
WORRY
ABPUT
THOSE
WHO
REFUSE
TO
BELIEVESATISFY
GODS
DECREES
AS
MUCH
AS
KEEPING
YOURSELF
STRAIGHT
IF
YOU
SEE
SOMETHING
GOING
ON
THAT
IS
WRONG
DISCUSS
IT
AND
EXPLORE
IT
BEFORE
MAKING
SUMMARY
JUDGEMENT
PEOPLE
HAVE
ENOUGH
FREE
WILL
TO
CHOOSE
FOR
THEMSELVES
SO
DONT
FORCE
CHOICES
ON
THEM
JUST
INFORM
THEM
OF
WHAT
THEYRE
CHOICES
ARE
GOD
WILL
TAKE
CARE
OF
THE
REST
IN
HIS
JUSTICE
