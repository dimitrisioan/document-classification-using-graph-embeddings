RE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
ALL
OF
THE
ARGUMENTS
CONCERNING
THE
SABBATH
OUGHT
TO
MAKE
THE
POINT
PRETTY
CLEAR
ANYONE
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
OR
ORTHODOX
ORANGLICAN
OR
MONOPHYSITE
CHURCHES
OURGHT
TO
WORSHIP
ON
SATURDAY
IF
THEY
ARE
REALLY
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
OTHERWISE
THEY
ARE
FOLLOWING
A
LAW
PUT
INTO
EFFECT
BY
THE
CHURCH
AND
ONLY
THE
ABOVE
CHRUCHES
REALLY
RECOGNIZE
ANY
POWER
OF
THE
CHRUCH
TO
DO
SO
ANDY
BYLER
YOU
WILL
NOTE
THAT
NOTHING
IN
THE
FAQ
SAID
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
CHURCH
ESTABLISHING
OR
CHANGING
A
LAW
THE
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
THE
SABBATH
IS
THAT
IT
IS
PART
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
AND
LIKE
THE
REST
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
IS
NOT
BINDING
ON
CHRISTIANS
THIS
ARGUMENT
IS
BASED
ON
PAULS
LETTERS
ACTS
AND
IN
A
MORE
GENERAL
SENSE
JESUS
TEACHINGS
FURTHER
MOST
PEOPLE
ARGUE
THAT
SCRIPTURE
SHOWS
WORSHIP
OCCURING
ON
SUNDAY
AND
PAUL
ENDORSING
IT
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THESE
POINTS
ARE
DISPUTED
AND
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
GO
AROUND
THE
DISPUTE
ONE
MORE
TIME
THE
POINT
IM
MAKING
HERE
IS
NOT
THAT
THESE
ARGUMENTS
ARE
RIGHT
BUT
THAT
THE
BACKING
THEY
CLAIM
IS
SCRIPTURE
ACCEPTING
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
DOES
NOT
COMMIT
US
TO
OBEYING
THE
ENTIRE
JEWISH
LAW
ACTS
AND
PAULS
LETTERS
ARE
QUITE
CLEAR
ON
THAT
I
THINK
EVEN
THE
SDAS
ACCEPT
IT
THE
DISAGREEMENT
IS
ON
WHERE
THE
BIBLE
WOULD
HAVE
US
PLACE
THE
LINE
BY
THE
WAY
PROTESTANTS
DO
GIVE
AUTHORITY
TO
THE
CHURCH
IN
MATTERS
THAT
ARE
NOT
DICTATED
BY
GOD
THATS
WHY
CHURCHES
ARE
FREE
TO
DETERMINE
THEIR
OWN
LITURGIES
CHURCH
POLITY
ETC
IF
YOU
ACCEPT
THAT
THE
SABBATH
IS
NOT
BINDING
ON
CHRISTIANS
THEN
THE
DAY
OF
WORSHIP
FALLS
INTO
THE
CATEGORY
OF
ITEMS
ON
WHICH
INDIVIDUAL
CHRISTIANS
OR
SINCE
WORSHIP
IS
BY
ITS
NATURE
A
GROUP
ACTIVITY
CHURCHES
ARE
FREE
TO
DECIDE
CLH
