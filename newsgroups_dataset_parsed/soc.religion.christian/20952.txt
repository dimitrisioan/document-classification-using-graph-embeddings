PAUL
HARVEY
WRITES
PRIORITY
THAN
THE
DIRECT
WORD
OF
JESUS
IN
PAUL
BEGINS
ROMANS
WITH
IF
SOMEONE
IS
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
DO
YOU
COUNT
YOURSELF
AS
ONE
WHO
IS
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
DO
YOU
COUNT
YOURSELF
AS
ONE
WHO
IS
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
YOU
READ
JESUS
WORD
IN
IS
THERE
ANY
DOUBT
IN
YOUR
MIND
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
AND
WHAT
IS
SIN
GREEK
HAMARTIA
MISSING
THE
MARK
IS
THERE
ANY
DOUBT
IN
YOUR
MIND
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
AND
WHAT
IS
MISSING
THE
MARK
HOWEVER
ID
LIKE
TO
BE
CLEAR
THAT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THERES
UNAMBIGUOUS
PROOF
THAT
REGULAR
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
WAS
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
AS
I
INDICATED
THERE
ARE
RESPONSES
ON
BOTH
OF
THE
PASSAGES
CITED
WHEREAS
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
AND
JESUS
WORDS
IN
ARE
FAIRLY
CLEAR
ARE
THEY
NOT
ARE
THEY
CLEAR
OR
DO
YOU
HAVE
DOUBTS
NO
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
PAUL
CAN
OVERRULE
GOD
AN
IMPORTANT
FIRST
STEP
THE
REALIZATION
THAT
PAUL
WAS
HUMAN
HOWEVER
PAUL
WAS
WRITING
FOR
A
LARGELY
GENTILE
AUDIENCE
YES
AND
HE
WAS
WRITING
AND
SPEAKING
FOR
AN
AUDIENCE
THAT
WAS
AT
BEST
VERY
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
MOST
COULD
NOT
READ
MOST
WERE
UNFAMILIAR
WITH
THE
HEBREW
SCRIPTURES
IN
EVEN
THE
SEPTUAGINT
FORM
PAUL
ADAPTED
THE
MESSAGE
OF
THE
BIBLE
TO
A
LARGELY
UNEDUCATED
MARKET
GRANTED
THIS
MARKET
STILL
EXISTS
TODAY
BUT
DO
YOU
COUNT
YOURSELF
AS
PART
OF
IT
TO
BE
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
IS
NOT
MISSING
THE
MARK
HAMARTIA
IF
YOU
DO
THE
BEST
THAT
YOUR
EDUCATION
ALLOWS
ARE
YOU
DOING
THE
BEST
THE
LAW
WAS
REGARDED
BY
JEWS
AT
THE
TIME
AND
NOW
AS
BINDING
ON
JEWS
BUT
NOT
ON
GENTILES
THERE
ARE
RULES
THAT
WERE
BINDING
ON
ALL
HUMAN
BEINGS
THE
SOCALLED
NOACHIC
LAWS
BUT
THEY
ARE
QUITE
MINIMAL
LET
ME
MAKE
CLEAR
THAT
THE
LAW
IS
NONE
OTHER
THAN
THE
PENTATEUCH
OF
GENESIS
EXODUS
LEVITICUS
NUMBERS
DEUTERONOMY
WHAT
DID
JESUS
SAY
ABOUT
THE
LAW
IN
WHERE
DID
JESUS
SAY
THAT
THE
LAW
ONLY
APPLIES
TO
JEWS
AND
THAT
GENTILES
ARE
ABOVE
THE
LAW
THE
ISSUE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
HAD
TO
FACE
AFTER
JESUS
DEATH
WAS
WHAT
TO
DO
ABOUT
GENTILES
WHO
WANTED
TO
FOLLOW
CHRIST
THE
DECISION
NOT
TO
IMPOSE
THE
LAW
ON
THEM
DIDNT
SAY
THAT
THE
LAW
WAS
ABOLISHED
IT
SIMPLY
ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT
FACT
THAT
IT
DIDNT
APPLY
TO
GENTILES
WHO
ACKNOWLEDGED
THIS
FACT
ON
WHAT
BASIS
ARE
WE
EXTRABIBLICAL
AT
THIS
POINT
WHY
NOT
ALSO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THE
BHAGAVADGITA
IS
THE
ONLY
RELEVANT
TEXT
FOR
GENTILES
AFTER
ALL
WE
SEE
IN
THE
BIBLE
THAT
IT
WAS
MAGUS
FROM
THE
EAST
WHO
OBSERVED
THE
STARSIGNS
OF
JESUS
WHY
BOTHER
WITH
ANY
TEXTS
AT
ALL
WHY
NOT
JUST
FOLLOW
WHATEVER
THE
CHURCH
HAS
TO
SAY
THUS
THERE
IS
NO
CONTRADICTION
WITH
MAT
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
YOU
CAN
SAY
THIS
WITH
A
STRAIGHT
FACE
ARE
YOU
A
FOLLOWER
OF
CHRIST
OR
DO
YOU
FOLLOW
SOMEONE
ELSE
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THE
WORDS
OF
JESUS
ONLY
APPLY
TO
JEWS
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
BOTH
PAUL
AND
OTHER
JEWISH
CHRISTIANS
DID
CONTINUE
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
JEWISH
WORSHIP
ON
THE
SABBATH
THUS
THEY
CONTINUED
TO
OBEY
THE
LAW
HOW
JEWISH
WAS
PAUL
AFTER
HE
CHANGED
HIS
NAME
FROM
SAUL
THE
ISSUE
WAS
AND
IS
WITH
GENTILE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
ARE
NOT
COVERED
BY
THE
LAW
OR
AT
LEAST
NOT
BY
THE
CEREMONIAL
ASPECTS
OF
IT
WHO
SAYS
GENTILE
CHRISTIANS
ARE
NOT
COVERED
BY
THE
FIRST
FIVE
BOOKS
WHO
SAYS
THAT
GENTILE
CHRISTIANS
ARE
ABOVE
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
JESUS
DEALT
MOSTLY
WITH
JEWS
I
THINK
WE
CAN
REASONABLY
ASSUME
THAT
MAT
WAS
DIRECTED
TO
A
JEWISH
AUDIENCE
YOURE
IMPLYING
THAT
JESUS
WORDS
ARE
VALID
ONLY
FOR
JEWS
IS
THIS
REALLY
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
TO
SAY
YOU
DO
REALIZE
THAT
YOU
ARE
GUTTING
RATHER
LARGE
PORTIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
WHEN
YOU
READ
JESUS
WORDS
DID
YOU
EVER
CONSIDER
THAT
MAYBE
JUST
MAYBE
JESUS
IS
TALKING
TO
YOU
NO
MATTER
WHAT
YOUR
RACE
OR
SEX
IF
THE
HEBREW
SCRIPTURES
AND
THE
GOSPEL
ACCOUNTS
OF
JESUS
ARE
ONLY
DIRECTED
TO
JEWS
WHY
WERE
THEY
TRANSLATED
INTO
ENGLISH
HE
DID
INTERACT
WITH
GENTILES
A
FEW
TIMES
EG
THE
CENTURION
WHOSE
SLAVE
WAS
HEALED
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
OTHERS
THE
TERMS
USED
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
CENTURION
SEE
LUKE
SUGGEST
THAT
HE
WAS
A
GODFEARER
IE
A
GENTILE
WHO
FOLLOWED
GOD
BUT
HAD
NOT
ADOPTED
THE
WHOLE
JEWISH
LAW
AS
PAUL
WOULD
CALL
HIM
ONE
WHO
WAS
WEAK
IN
THE
FAITH
HE
WAS
COMMENDED
BY
JEWISH
ELDERS
AS
A
WORTHY
PERSON
AND
JESUS
ACCEPTED
HIM
AS
SUCH
THIS
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
INDICATE
THAT
JESUS
ACCEPTED
THE
PREVAILING
VIEW
THAT
GENTILES
NEED
NOT
ACCEPT
THE
LAW
WHICH
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THE
RECORDED
WORD
OF
JESUS
OR
INDICATIONS
THAT
YOU
CAN
DEDUCE
FROM
THE
BIBLE
WAS
JESUS
GOD
ONLY
OF
THE
JEWS
OR
GOD
OF
ALL
HUMANKIND
OF
ALL
RACE
AND
SEX
HOWEVER
THERES
MORE
INVOLVED
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
COMPARE
JESUS
AND
PAUL
ON
THE
LAW
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
A
FULL
PICTURE
OF
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
LAW
WE
HAVE
TO
COME
TO
GRIPS
WITH
PAULS
APPARENT
REJECTION
OF
THE
LAW
AND
HOW
THAT
RELATES
TO
JESUS
COMMENDATION
OF
THE
LAW
AT
LEAST
AS
I
READ
PAUL
HE
SAYS
THAT
THE
LAW
SERVES
A
PURPOSE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
IN
A
CERTAIN
SENSE
SUPERCEDED
THIS
IS
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
PAUL
COMPARE
THIS
TO
THE
WORD
OF
JESUS
ARE
YOU
CHRISTIAN
OR
PAULINE
AGAIN
THIS
ISSUE
ISNT
ONE
OF
THE
ABOLITION
OF
THE
LAW
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
HIS
DISCUSSION
PAUL
NOTES
THAT
HE
MIGHT
BE
UNDERSTOOD
THIS
WAY
AND
ASSURES
US
THAT
THATS
NOT
WHAT
HE
INTENDS
TO
SAY
RATHER
HE
SEES
THE
LAW
AS
PRIMARILY
BEING
PRESENT
TO
CONVICT
PEOPLE
OF
THEIR
SINFULNESS
BUT
ULTIMATELY
ITS
AN
IMPOSSIBLE
STANDARD
AND
ONE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
SUPERCEDED
BY
CHRIST
AGAIN
THIS
IS
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
PAUL
DID
JESUS
SAY
THAT
THE
LAW
WAS
AN
IMPOSSIBLE
STANDARD
DID
JESUS
SAY
THAT
HE
SUPERCEDED
THE
LAW
ARE
YOU
CHRISTIAN
OR
PAULINE
PAULS
COMMENTS
ARE
NOT
THE
WORLDS
CLEAREST
HERE
AND
NOT
EVERYONE
AGREES
WITH
MY
READING
YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
IT
IS
YOUR
READING
OF
PAUL
WHAT
DID
JESUS
SAY
CAN
YOU
DENY
THAT
IS
QUITE
CLEAR
IN
ITS
MEANING
ARE
YOU
CHRISTIAN
OR
PAULINE
BUT
THE
INTERESTING
THING
TO
NOTICE
IS
THAT
EVEN
THIS
RADICAL
POSITION
DOES
NOT
ENTAIL
AN
ABOLITION
OF
THE
LAW
IT
STILL
REMAINS
AS
AN
UNCOMPROMISING
STANDARD
FROM
WHICH
NOT
AN
IOTA
OR
DOT
MAY
BE
REMOVED
FOR
ITS
PURPOSE
OF
CONVICTING
OF
SIN
ITS
IMPORTANT
THAT
IT
NOT
BE
RELAXED
WHEN
DID
JESUS
SAY
THAT
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
LAW
WAS
CONVICTION
OF
SIN
HOWEVER
FOR
CHRISTIANS
ITS
NOT
THE
END
ULTIMATELY
WE
LIVE
IN
FAITH
NOT
LAW
PLEASE
REREAD
ARE
YOU
CHRISTIAN
OR
PAULINE
JESUS
INTERPRETATIONS
EMPHASIZE
THE
INTENT
OF
THE
LAW
AND
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THE
CEREMONIAL
DETAILS
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
ARE
CEREMONIAL
DETAILS
PAULS
CONCLUSION
IS
SIMILAR
WHILE
HE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LAW
BEING
SUPERCEDED
ALL
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
HE
GIVES
INVOLVE
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
SUCH
AS
CIRCUMCISION
AND
THE
SABBATH
HE
IS
QUITE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
MAINTAINING
MORAL
STANDARDS
YOU
CALL
OBSERVANCE
OF
THE
SABBATH
THE
DAY
ON
WHICH
THE
LORD
RESTED
CEREMONIAL
HAS
CIRCUMCISION
BEEN
SUPERCEDED
FOR
CHRISTIANS
ARE
YOU
CHRISTIAN
OR
PAULINE
BOTH
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
IN
MY
MIND
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
SIN
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
AT
LEAST
NOT
IN
THIS
CASE
JESUS
DID
NOT
DEAL
EXPLICITLY
WITH
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
THE
LAW
WAS
BINDING
ON
GENTILES
THATS
WHY
I
HAVE
TO
CITE
EVIDENCE
SUCH
AS
THE
WAY
JESUS
DEALT
WITH
THE
CENTURION
AS
TO
GENERAL
JEWISH
VIEWS
ON
THIS
I
AM
DEPENDENT
LARGELY
ON
STUDIES
OF
PAULINE
THEOLOGY
ONE
BY
HJ
SCHOEPS
AND
ONE
WHOSE
AUTHOR
I
CANT
COME
UP
WITH
AT
THE
MOMENT
BOTH
AUTHORS
ARE
JEWS
ALSO
VARIOUS
CHRISTIAN
AND
NONCHRISTIAN
JEWS
HAVE
DISCUSSED
THE
ISSUE
HERE
AND
IN
OTHER
NEWSGROUPS
MAT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
LAW
IS
STILL
VALID
IT
DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
IT
APPLIES
TO
GENTILES
AND
YES
I
SAY
THAT
THE
SPECIFIC
REQUIREMENT
FOR
WORSHIP
ON
THE
SABBATH
IN
THE
TEN
COMMANDMENTS
IS
A
CEREMONIAL
DETAIL
WHEN
YOURE
LOOKING
AT
THE
OBLIGATIONS
OF
GENTILES
SIMILARLY
CIRCUMCISION
IM
NOT
SURE
QUITE
WHAT
ELSE
I
CAN
SAY
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
AGAIN
ITS
UNFORTUNATE
THE
JESUS
DIDNT
ANSWER
THE
QUESTION
DIRECTLY
HOWEVER
WE
DO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
CENT
JEWISH
APPROACH
WAS
HOW
JESUS
DEALT
WITH
AT
LEAST
ONE
GENTILE
AND
HOW
JESUS
DISCIPLES
DEALT
WITH
THE
ISSUE
WHEN
IT
BECAME
MORE
ACUTE
IM
REFERRING
TO
ACTS
MORE
THAN
PAUL
GIVEN
THAT
THESE
ARE
ALL
IN
AGREEMENT
I
DONT
SEE
THAT
THERES
A
BIG
PROBLEM
CLH
