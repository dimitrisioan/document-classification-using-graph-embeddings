RE
ATHEISTS
VIEWS
ON
CHRISTIANITY
WAS
RE
ACCEPTING
JEESUS
IN
YOUR
HEART
FIRST
I
THANK
COLLECTIVELY
ALL
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
GIVEN
GOOD
ANSWERS
TO
MY
QUESTIONS
IN
MY
FOLLOWUP
TO
JASON
SMITHS
POSTING
I
WILL
ADDRESS
SOME
ISSUES
THAT
HAVE
CAUSED
MISUNDERSTANDING
JASON
SMITH
JASONSATLASTELECOM
WROTE
IN
ARTICLE
KEMPMPPHOENIXOULUFI
PETRI
PIHKO
WRITES
I
ALSO
CONCEDE
THAT
I
WAS
DOUBLY
REMISS
AS
I
ASSERTED
NO
REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVE
EXISTS
AN
ENTIRELY
SUBJECTIVE
STATEMENT
ON
MY
PART
AND
ONE
THAT
COULD
BE
INVALIDATED
GIVEN
TIME
AND
FURTHER
DISCOVERY
BY
THE
SCIENTIST
I
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
A
PROVING
A
THEORY
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
SPECIFY
THAT
THIS
IS
HOW
IT
HAPPENED
BUT
PROPOSES
A
LIKELY
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
PHENOMENA
IN
QUESTION
AM
I
MISTAKEN
WITH
THIS
UNDERSTANDING
YES
TO
SOME
DEGREE
THERE
WAS
AN
EXCELLENT
DISCUSSION
IN
SCISKEPTIC
ON
THE
NATURE
OF
SCIENTIFIC
WORK
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
HOPE
IT
DID
NOT
ESCAPE
YOUR
NOTICE
THE
CORRECT
WORD
IS
LIKELY
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
BE
SURE
OUR
MODELS
AND
THEORIES
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CORRECT
THEORIES
ARE
BACKED
UP
BY
EVIDENCE
BUT
NOT
PROVED
NO
THEORY
CAN
BE
TRUE
IN
A
MATHEMATICAL
SENSE
HOWEVER
THEORIES
ARE
NOT
MERE
DESCRIPTIONS
OR
RATIONALISATIONS
OF
PHENOMENA
IT
IS
EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT
TO
TEST
WHETHER
THEORIES
CAN
PREDICT
SOMETHING
NEW
OR
NOT
YET
OBSERVED
ALL
SUCCESSFUL
THEORIES
SCIENCE
HAS
COME
UP
WITH
HAVE
PASSED
THIS
TEST
INCLUDING
THE
BIG
BANG
THEORY
OF
COSMIC
EVOLUTION
THE
THEORY
OF
NATURAL
SELECTION
ETC
IT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THEY
MUST
BE
CORRECT
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
MERE
BEST
FITS
FOR
THE
DATA
BUT
IF
YOU
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
MUST
BE
AN
ANSWER
TO
HOW
DID
THE
UNIVERSE
OUR
SPACETIME
EMERGE
FROM
NOTHING
SCIENCE
HAS
SOME
GOOD
CANDIDATES
FOR
AN
ANSWER
ALL
OF
WHICH
REQUIRE
SOMETHING
WE
CHRISTIANS
READILY
ADMIT
TO
FAITH
WELL
YES
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THEM
THIS
IS
NOT
WHAT
SCIENCE
REQUIRES
TAKE
A
GOOD
LOOK
AT
THE
THEORY
AND
THE
EVIDENCE
SEE
IF
THE
THEORY
HAS
MADE
ANY
SUCCESSFUL
PREDICTIONS
AND
USE
YOUR
REASON
DISBELIEVERS
ARE
NOT
PUNISHED
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
CANDIDATES
BELIES
THAT
NONE
ARE
CONCLUSIVE
WITH
OUT
CONCLUSIVE
EVIDENCE
WE
ARE
LEFT
WITH
FAITH
THIS
IS
WHAT
PUZZLES
ME
WHY
DO
WE
NEED
TO
HAVE
FAITH
IN
ANYTHING
MY
FELLOW
ATHEISTS
WOULD
CALL
ME
A
WEAK
ATHEIST
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
UNABLE
TO
BELIEVE
IE
FAILS
TO
ENTERTAIN
ANY
BELIEF
IN
GOD
YES
I
KNOW
THAT
ONE
CANT
BELIEVE
WITHOUT
GODS
HELP
LUTHER
MAKES
THIS
QUITE
CLEAR
IN
HIS
LETTER
TO
ERASMUS
IM
AFRAID
THIS
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
MY
SITUATION
A
COUPLE
OF
PARAGRAPHS
DELETED
SUMMARY
WE
ASK
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
I
THINK
THIS
QUESTION
SHOULD
ACTUALLY
BE
SPLIT
INTO
TWO
PARTS
NAMELY
WHY
IS
THERE
EXISTENCE
WHY
ANYTHING
EXISTS
AND
HOW
DID
THE
UNIVERSE
EMERGE
FROM
NOTHING
DELETIONS
THE
QUESTION
WHY
ANYTHING
EXISTS
CAN
BE
COUNTERED
BY
DEMANDING
ANSWER
TO
A
QUESTION
WHY
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
NOTHINGNESS
OR
IN
NONEXISTENCE
ACTUALLY
BOTH
QUESTIONS
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
DEVOID
OF
MEANING
THINGS
THAT
EXIST
DO
AND
THINGS
THAT
DONT
EXIST
DONT
EXIST
TAUTOLOGY
AT
ITS
BEST
CAREFULLY
EXAMINE
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
AND
THEN
THE
COUNTERQUESTION
THE
FIRST
ASKS
WHY
WHILE
THE
SECOND
IS
A
REQUEST
FOR
DEFINITION
NO
IT
IS
NOT
ALTHOUGH
IT
DOES
LOOK
LIKE
ONE
THIS
IS
A
TRUE
DICHOTOMY
EITHER
SOMETHING
EXISTS
OR
NOTHING
EXISTS
IF
NOTHING
EXISTS
NOBODY
WOULD
ASK
WHY
IF
SOMETHING
EXISTS
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
ASK
WHY
BUT
ACTUALLY
NO
EXISTING
BEING
COULD
GIVE
AN
ANSWER
IMAGINE
FOR
A
MOMENT
THAT
THE
NOBODIES
IN
NONEXISTENCE
COULD
ALSO
ASK
WHY
NOTHING
EXISTS
THIS
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
MY
COUNTERQUESTION
WHY
NOTHING
EXISTS
IN
NOTHINGNESS
NOW
WHY
ANYTHING
EXISTS
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
WHY
SOMETHING
EXISTS
IN
SOMETHINGNESS
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
MEANT
WITH
MY
TAUTOLOGY
MY
APOLOGIES
FOR
THE
POOR
WORDING
IN
MY
PREVIOUS
POST
I
MIGHT
ADD
THE
WORLDVIEW
OF
THINGS
THAT
EXIST
DO
AND
THINGS
THAT
DONTDONT
IS
AS
GROUNDED
IN
THE
REALM
OF
THE
NONFALSIFIABLE
AS
DOES
THE
THEISTS
BELIEF
IN
GOD
IT
IS
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THERE
IS
NOT
A
REASON
FOR
BEING
SOMETHING
AS
ULTIMATELY
UNSUPPORTABLE
AS
THE
POSITION
OF
THERE
BEING
A
REASON
ITS
VERY
FOUNDATION
EXISTS
IN
THE
SAME
SOIL
AS
THAT
OF
ONE
WHO
CLAIMS
THERE
IS
A
REASON
I
DO
INDEED
THINK
THERE
PROBABLY
IS
NO
REASON
FOR
BEING
OR
EXISTENCE
IN
GENERAL
FOR
REASONS
I
STATED
ABOVE
HOWEVER
THEY
WILL
STILL
LEAVE
OPEN
THE
QUESTION
WHY
THIS
AND
NOT
THAT
AND
THIS
IS
WHERE
THEISTIC
EXPLANATIONS
COME
IN
SCIENCE
CANNOT
GIVE
REASONS
FOR
ANY
PARTICULAR
HUMAN
BEINGS
EXISTENCE
WE
COME
TO
THIS
EITHER
I
AM
THEREFORE
I
AM
OR
I
AM
FOR
A
REASON
THIS
IS
A
DEEP
PHILOSOPHICAL
QUESTION
IS
DETERMINISM
TRUE
OR
NOT
ALSO
IS
GOD
DETERMINISTIC
OR
NOT
I
TEND
TO
THINK
THIS
QUESTION
HAS
NO
MEANING
IN
HIS
CASE
IF
I
AM
FOR
A
REASON
IVE
YET
FAILED
TO
SEE
WHAT
IT
WOULD
BE
FROM
OUR
PERSPECTIVE
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
I
EXIST
FOR
TRULY
RANDOM
REASONS
I
JUST
ROLLED
TWO
DICE
WHY
DID
I
GET
AND
HOW
CAN
I
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
ANY
BETTER
REASON
FOR
MY
EXISTENCE
IF
THE
FORMER
IS
A
SATISFACTORY
ANSWER
THEN
YOU
ARE
DONE
FOR
YOU
ARE
SATISFIED
AND
NEED
NOT
A
DOCTOR
IF
THE
LATTER
YOUR
SEARCH
IS
JUST
BEGINNING
YES
I
AM
SATISFIED
WITH
THIS
REASON
UNTIL
I
FIND
SOMETHING
BETTER
MY
YEARS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
WERE
OF
NO
HELP
IN
THIS
RESPECT
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
BUT
I
AM
PATIENT
ANOTHER
ANSWER
IS
THAT
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
SOUNDS
MUCH
BETTER
BUT
I
AM
TEMPTED
TO
ASK
DOES
GOD
HIMSELF
EXIST
THEN
IF
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
OWN
EXISTENCE
IT
CAN
ONLY
MEAN
THAT
HE
HAS
IN
TERMS
OF
HUMAN
TIME
ALWAYS
EXISTED
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
DOES
NOT
PRECLUDE
HIS
EXISTENCE
IT
ONLY
SEEKS
TO
IDENTIFY
HIS
QUALITIES
IMPLYING
HE
EXISTS
TO
HAVE
QUALITIES
BTW
NO
IT
DOESNT
BUT
I
THINK
AN
EXISTING
GOD
CANNOT
KNOW
WHY
HE
EXISTS
FOR
AN
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
IS
NOT
KNOWABLE
OF
COURSE
THIS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ANY
OBSTACLE
TO
BELIEF
IN
HIS
EXISTENCE
I
ALSO
HAVE
DISCOVERED
SCIENCE
IS
AN
INADEQUATE
TOOL
TO
ANSWER
WHY
IT
APPEARS
THAT
M
PIHKO
AGREES
AS
WE
SHALL
SEE
BUT
BECAUSE
A
TOOL
IS
INADEQUATE
TO
ANSWER
A
QUESTION
DOES
NOT
PRECLUDE
THE
QUESTION
ASSERTING
THAT
WHY
IS
AN
INVALID
QUESTION
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
AN
ANSWER
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
KNOW
UNKNOWABLE
THINGS
HOWEVER
THE
QUESTION
WHY
DO
I
EXIST
IN
PARTICULAR
IS
NOT
AN
INVALID
QUESTION
THIS
IS
NOT
WHAT
I
SAID
BUT
FROM
OUR
PERSPECTIVE
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TELL
AND
I
CANT
JUST
BELIEVE
IN
ANY
GIVEN
EXPLANATION
INSTEAD
OF
ANOTHER
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
I
FOUND
I
WAS
DELUDING
MYSELF
MY
APOLOGIES
I
WAS
USING
WHY
AS
WHY
DID
THIS
COME
TO
BE
WHY
DID
PREEXISTENCE
BECOME
EXISTENCE
WHY
DID
PRESPACETIME
BECOME
SPACETIME
I
THINK
PREEXISTENCE
IS
AN
OXYMORON
THERE
IS
NO
TIME
OUTSIDE
OF
THIS
SPACETIME
EXCEPT
IN
SOME
OTHER
UNIVERSE
AND
FROM
THAT
PERSPECTIVE
OUR
UNIVERSE
NEVER
WAS
IT
EXISTS
ONLY
FOR
THOSE
WHO
ARE
INSIDE
IT
BUT
WE
COME
TO
THE
ADMISSION
THAT
SCIENCE
FAILS
TO
ANSWER
WHY
BECAUSE
IT
CANT
BE
ANSWERED
IN
THE
REALM
OF
MODERN
SCIENCE
DOES
THAT
MAKE
THE
QUESTION
INVALID
NO
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THE
QUESTION
HAS
TO
BE
DISCUSSED
SEPARATELY
I
THINK
PHILOSOPHY
IS
OF
GREAT
HELP
HERE
WHAT
CAN
BE
KNOWN
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
KNOWABLE
M
PIHKO
DOES
PRESENT
A
GOOD
POINT
THOUGH
WE
MAY
NEED
TO
ASK
WHAT
DO
I
AS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
CHRISTIAN
BASE
MY
FAITH
ON
WILL
IT
BE
SHAKEN
BY
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
SHATTERS
OUR
SACRED
COWS
OR
WILL
WE
SEEK
TO
UNDERSTAND
IF
A
NEW
DISCOVERY
TRULY
DISAGREES
WITH
WHAT
GOD
SAID
AND
CONTINUES
TO
SAY
IN
HIS
WORD
THIS
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
QUESTION
IN
TRYING
TO
ANSWER
THIS
AND
NUMEROUS
OTHER
QUESTIONS
THAT
BOTHERED
ME
I
FINALLY
FOUND
NOTHING
TO
BASE
MY
FAITH
ON
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
BE
HONEST
IF
WE
ALL
ASKED
OURSELVES
WHY
DO
I
BELIEVE
OR
WHY
I
DONT
BELIEVE
