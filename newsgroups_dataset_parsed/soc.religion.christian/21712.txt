DARIN
JOHNSON
WRITES
OK
WHATS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
GAY
CHRISTIANS
SEX
OR
CHRISTIANITY
IM
AFRAID
I
SEE
THAT
QUESTION
AS
VERY
TENDENTIOUS
TRY
REPHRASING
IT
WHATS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
CHRISTIANS
LOVE
OF
GOD
OR
LOVE
OF
OTHER
HUMAN
BEINGS
TO
WHICH
OF
COURSE
THE
ONLY
CONCEIVABLE
ANSWER
IS
THAT
THE
ONE
IS
LIKE
THE
OTHER
I
AM
DEEPLY
SUSPICIOUS
OF
ANY
FLAVOR
OF
CHRISTIANITY
WHICH
WOULD
ELEVATE
ONE
CLAUSE
OF
THE
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
TO
A
PRIORITY
OVER
THE
OTHER
SUCH
AS
TO
CLAIM
A
CONFLICT
TRUE
WE
ARE
TOLD
TO
LET
THE
DEAD
BURY
THE
DEAD
TO
HATE
FAMILY
RATHER
THAN
LET
IT
KEEP
US
FROM
FOLLOWING
CHRIST
BUT
THE
DICHOTOMY
HERE
IS
NOT
ONE
BETWEEN
LOVE
OF
OUR
FELLOWS
AND
LOVE
OF
GOD
BUT
OF
ALLOWING
SOCIAL
CONSTRUCTS
TO
BLIND
US
TO
THE
PRESENSE
OF
GOD
IT
IS
PARTICULARLY
SATANIC
TO
TWIST
LOVE
OF
GOD
IN
SUCH
A
MANNER
AS
TO
BECOME
AN
EXCUSE
TO
TREAT
OTHERS
AS
ON
A
DIFFERENT
LEVEL
THAN
THE
ONE
WHO
IS
SO
CAUGHT
UP
IN
LOVE
OF
GOD
THE
TROUBLE
COMES
IN
THE
RELATION
OF
HUMAN
LOVE
AND
HUMAN
SEX
YES
IT
HAS
SOMETIMES
BEEN
THE
CASE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
HAS
TAUGHT
THAT
ALL
SEX
WAS
NASTY
EVIL
SINFUL
STUFF
BUT
WHEN
MAN
AND
WIFE
LEAVE
THEIR
PARENTAL
HOMES
TO
BECOME
HELPMATES
LIVING
IN
ONE
FLESH
IT
IS
THE
SEX
THAT
IS
THE
VEHICLE
OF
BECOMING
ONE
FLESH
IF
YOU
DOUBT
ME
READ
ST
PAUL
ON
WHAT
IS
WRONG
WITH
FREQUENTING
PROSTITUTES
LESS
PROVOCATIVELY
WHAT
I
MEAN
IS
JUST
THIS
SEXUAL
BONDING
IS
A
DEEPLY
FOUNDED
ASPECT
OF
OUR
SOCIAL
INTERACTION
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
IS
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
INSTITUTION
OF
MARRIAGE
SO
THAT
UNLIKE
WITH
MANY
MAMMALS
HUMAN
MALES
REMAIN
WITH
AND
FOSTER
THE
CHILDREN
THEY
BEGET
AND
SUPPORT
THEIR
CHILDRENS
MOTHERS
THIS
IS
THE
SCHEMA
BEHIND
GENESIS
AND
BEHIND
JESUS
CITATION
OF
THAT
PASSAGE
I
OBSERVE
BY
THE
WAY
THAT
NOT
ALL
HUMAN
MALES
IN
FACT
DO
AS
I
HAVE
JUST
DESCRIBED
BUT
ANOTHER
THING
THAT
CHARACTERIZES
HUMAN
SOCIETIES
IS
OUR
RAISING
OF
NONBEGOTTEN
CHILDREN
NOT
ONLY
ORPHANS
AND
ADOPTEES
AND
THE
LIKE
BUT
PRODUCTS
OF
THE
QUITE
COMMON
INFIDELITIES
OF
HUMANS
TO
THEIR
SPOUSES
WE
ARE
IN
THIS
NOT
UNIQUE
IN
THE
ANIMAL
WORLD
BUT
THE
FULL
EXTENT
OF
SOCIAL
CONSEQUENCES
AND
IMPLICATIONS
IS
MOST
INTRICATE
FOR
US
YES
OF
COURSE
IT
SOMETIMES
GOES
WRONG
LIKE
ALL
ELSE
WE
DO
IT
IS
INFECTED
WITH
SIN
AND
YOU
FIND
MARRIED
COUPLES
WHERE
THERE
IS
NO
BOND
AND
PEOPLE
SO
DELIRIOUSLY
ADDICTED
TO
THE
INITIAL
STAGES
OF
SEXUAL
BOND
FORMATION
THE
INFATUATION
FALLING
IN
LOVE
PHASE
THAT
THEY
BREAK
ANY
FORMING
BOND
IN
ORDER
TO
KEEP
STEPPING
OVER
THE
THRESHOLD
OF
THE
DEEP
UNITY
GOD
HAS
PREPARED
FOR
US
AND
STEPPING
BACK
OUT
AGAIN
RIGHT
AWAY
SATAN
MAY
INDEED
USE
SEX
AS
A
VERY
HANDY
TOOL
TO
CORRUPT
HUMAN
LOVE
BUT
IN
THE
EDENIC
CREATION
THAT
IS
NOT
ITS
NATURE
AND
WITH
GODS
GRACE
UNDER
THE
POWER
OF
CHRIST
TO
MAKE
ALL
THINGS
NEW
IT
NEED
NOT
BE
A
PROBLEM
FOR
CHRISTIANS
THOUGH
WE
MUST
BE
VIGILANT
EVEN
IN
CHRIST
AS
THE
DEVIL
IS
WATCHFUL
PROWLING
AROUND
LIKE
A
ROARING
LION
SEEKING
SOMEONE
TO
DEVOUR
SO
RETURNING
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
WHAT
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
STRAIGHT
CHRISTIANS
SEX
OR
CHRISTIANITY
PAUL
CLEARLY
TENDED
TO
THINK
THAT
SEX
WAS
AT
BEST
A
DISTRACTION
FROM
CHRISTIANITY
THOUGH
TO
BE
CHARITABLE
TO
HIM
HIS
CONTEXT
WAS
IN
EXPECTATION
OF
IMMEDIATE
PAROUSIA
SO
THAT
THE
HARD
TASKS
OF
A
MARRIED
UNION
THE
LIFELONG
BUILDING
AND
ADAPTATION
TO
EACH
OTHER
SEEMED
SOMEHOW
TO
UNDERCUT
THE
PROPER
PREPARATION
FOR
AN
IMMEDIATE
ESCHATON
SINCE
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
THE
HOUR
OF
RETURN
WE
SHOULD
ACT
BOTH
WITH
INSTANT
READINESS
FOR
THAT
AND
WITH
A
COMMITIMENT
TO
OUR
MATES
THAT
PROPOSES
A
LONG
LIFETIME
TOGETHER
AND
TELLING
PEOPLE
NOT
TO
BOND
IN
SUCH
A
PERSPECTIVE
STRIKES
ME
AS
CRIPPLING
US
IN
THE
SECOND
CLAUSE
OF
THE
THE
COMMANDMENT
TO
LOVE
I
WOULD
CLAIM
THAT
ONLY
A
VERY
FEW
SAINTS
HAVE
THE
CAPACITY
TO
DEEPLY
LOVE
WITHOUT
SEXUAL
TINGES
OR
COMPLICATION
MIND
YOU
THEIR
FELLOW
HUMAN
BEINGS
UNLESS
THEY
HAVE
HAD
A
DEEPLY
SPIRITUAL
LIFE
IN
MARRIED
UNION
GROWING
TOGETHER
AS
ONE
FLESH
AND
THAT
MEANS
IN
THE
TYPE
CASE
WITH
A
PERSISTENT
AND
CONTINUED
SEXUAL
RELATIONSHIP
WE
ARE
HUMAN
AND
LITTLE
GOOD
COMES
OF
TRYING
TO
MORTIFY
THE
FLESH
TO
THE
POINT
OF
PRETENDING
TO
BE
OTHERWISE
PRETENDING
NOT
TO
BE
SEXUAL
BEINGS
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
HOPE
WOULD
THEY
BE
WILLING
TO
FORGO
SEX
COMPLETELY
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
BEING
A
STUMBLING
BLOCK
TO
OTHERS
IT
DEPENDS
ENTIRELY
ON
CONTEXT
IF
THAT
CONTEXT
IS
MAJOR
HYPOCRISY
ON
THE
PART
OF
THOSE
WHO
FIND
US
STUMBLING
BLOCKS
I
AM
MUCH
LESS
OF
A
MIND
TO
EFFACE
MYSELF
SO
THAT
THEY
CAN
PONTIFICATE
ABOUT
MY
SINS
THERE
ARE
SOME
PEOPLE
FOR
WHOM
A
LIFE
OF
CELIBACY
IS
A
SPRITUAL
GIFT
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
A
VICTORY
AGAINST
A
TOTHEM
TROUBLING
SEXUAL
URGE
THAT
SEEMS
TO
THEM
TO
LEAD
ONLY
TO
SIN
NOTHING
I
SAY
SHOULD
EVER
BE
READ
AS
DEMEANING
SUCH
A
GIFT
NOR
THE
EVEN
RARER
GIFT
OF
LOVE
FOR
ALL
OUR
CONSPECIFICS
AND
INDEED
FOR
ALL
GODS
CREATION
THAT
CAN
DEVELOP
TO
THE
FULL
WITHOUT
THE
TUTORING
OF
A
SPOUSALHELPMATE
MARRIAGE
FOUNDED
IN
SEX
BUT
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
SPIRITUAL
GIFTS
AND
PENANCE
TELLING
PEOPLE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
HAVE
A
PARTICULAR
GIFT
OR
ELSE
WHAT
IS
FRAUGHT
WITH
MANIPULATION
AND
DISREGARD
OF
THE
DIFFERENCES
OF
OUR
SPIRITUAL
ENDOWMENTS
FROM
GOD
TO
ONE
PERSON
IS
GIVEN
THE
GIFT
OF
SPEAKING
IN
TOUNGUES
TO
ANOTHER
INTEPRETATION
OF
TOUNGUES
TO
YET
ANOTHER
PROPHECY
AND
TO
STILL
ANOTHER
TEACHING
THE
NOTION
THAT
SOME
PARTICULAR
GIFT
IS
REQUIRED
OF
ALL
IS
ONE
OF
THE
EARLIEST
HERESIES
MICHAEL

I
SAY
YOU
ARE
GODS
SONS
OF
THE
MLSPANIXCOM
MOST
HIGH
ALL
OF
