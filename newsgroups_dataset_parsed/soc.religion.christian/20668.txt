RELIGIOUS
WARS
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
THE
SORT
OF
THING
YOU
GUYS
LIKE
TO
DISCUSS
I
GUESS
IT
FALLS
INTO
THE
AREA
OF
APOLOGETICS
THIS
IS
A
QUESTION
THAT
SEEMS
TO
POP
UP
NOW
AND
AGAIN
IN
CONVERSATIONS
WITH
NONCHRISTIANS
IT
USUALLY
APPEARS
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
SORT
OF
UNQUALIFIED
STATEMENT
WELL
YOU
KNOW
THAT
RELIGION
HAS
CAUSED
MORE
WARS
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
IT
BOTHERS
ME
THAT
I
CANNOT
SEEM
TO
FIND
A
SATISFACTORY
RESPONSE
TO
THIS
AFTER
ALL
IF
OUR
RELIGION
IS
ALL
ABOUT
PEACE
AND
LOVE
WHY
HAVE
THERE
BEEN
SO
MANY
RELIGIOUS
WARS
PERSONALLY
I
AM
OF
THE
VIEW
THAT
RELIGION
HAS
OFTEN
BEEN
USED
AS
AN
EXCUSE
TO
INSTIGATE
WARS
OFTEN
TO
DISGUISE
NATIONAL
AMBITIONS
BUT
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HEAR
WHAT
ANYONE
ELSE
HAS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THIS
SUBJECT
THANKS

ADVANCE

THAT
THE

PERHAPS
WE
SHOULD
NOT
ASK
WHETHER
A
RELIGION

PHILOSOPHY
HAS
BEEN
INVOLVED
IN

WARS
SINCE
THEY
ALL
HAVE

WHETHER
IT
HAS
STOPPED
