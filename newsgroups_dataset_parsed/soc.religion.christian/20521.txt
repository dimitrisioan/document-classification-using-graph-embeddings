i
have
to
say
that
i
some
qualms
about
giving
you
this
explanation
because
it
raises
additional
problems
if
god
is
the
source
of
all
existence
then
a
complete
separation
from
him
would
make
existence
itself
impossible
so
does
god
maintain
just
enough
connection
with
those
who
are
rejected
to
keep
them
in
existence
so
he
can
punish
them
in
a
short
poem
god
in
his
mercy
made
the
fixed
pains
of
hell
c
s
lewis
expresses
an
idea
that
im
sure
was
current
among
others
but
i
havent
be
able
to
find
its
source
that
even
hell
is
an
expression
of
mercy
because
god
limits
the
amount
of
separation
from
him
and
hence
the
amount
of
agony
that
one
can
achieve
