RE
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
ATTERLEPVELAACSOAKLANDEDU
WRITES
HELLO
I
HAVE
SEEN
TWO
COMMON
THREADS
RUNNING
THROUGH
POSTINGS
BY
ATHEISTS
ON
THE
NEWSGROUP
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THEY
CAN
BE
USED
TO
EXPLAIN
EACH
OTHER
UNFORTUNATELY
I
DONT
HAVE
DIRECT
QUOTES
HANDY
ATHEISTS
BELIEVE
THAT
WHEN
THEY
DIE
THEY
DIE
FOREVER
TRUE
TO
A
POINT
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
ASK
A
BUDDHIST
ATHEIST
A
GOD
WHO
WOULD
CONDEMN
THOSE
WHO
FAIL
TO
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
TO
ETERNAL
DEATH
IS
UNFAIR
I
DONT
SEE
WHAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TO
CHRISTIANS
HELL
IS
BY
DEFINITION
ETERNAL
DEATHEXACTLY
WHAT
ATHEISTS
ARE
EXPECTING
WHEN
THEY
DIE
THERES
NO
REASON
HELL
HAS
TO
BE
ESPECIALLY
AWFULTO
MOST
PEOPLE
ETERNAL
DEATH
IS
BAD
ENOUGH
ACTUALLY
YES
AND
NO
HELL
IS
ETERNAL
DEATH
ACTUALLY
THE
WAY
IVE
HAD
IT
RELATED
TO
ME
ITS
MORE
OF
AN
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
WHERE
SINNERS
WILL
FEEL
THE
LICKING
FLAMES
OF
HELL
IF
I
SUPPOSEDLY
CAN
FEEL
THESE
FLAMES
I
WOULD
ASSUME
IM
STILL
ALIVE
BUT
SUFFERING
AND
AWAY
FROM
GOD
LITERAL
INTERPRETERS
OF
THE
BIBLE
WILL
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
VIEW
SINCE
THE
BIBLE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
FIRES
OF
HELL
AND
SUCH
PERSONALLY
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
PEOPLE
IN
HELL
WILL
BE
THRUST
INTO
FLAME
ANY
MORE
THAN
I
EXPECT
TO
JESUS
WITH
A
DOUBLEEDGED
SWORD
ISSUING
FROM
HIS
MOUTHI
TREAT
BOTH
THESE
STATE
MENTS
AS
METAPHORICAL
I
BELIEVE
JEHOVAHS
WITNESSES
HAVE
A
SIMILAR
VIEW
WHERE
THE
BODY
SLEEPS
FOR
EVER
I
DONT
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
BEING
CONDEMNED
TO
HELL
EITHER
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
IF
GOD
WANTS
TO
PUNISH
ME
FOR
BEING
HONEST
IN
MY
SKEPTICISM
THAT
IS
FOR
SAYING
HE
DOESNT
EXIST
HE
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
BE
CHANGING
HIS
NATURE
BESIDES
I
WOULD
RATHER
SPEND
AN
ETERNITY
IN
HELL
THAN
BE
BESIDE
GOD
IN
HEAVEN
KNOWING
EVEN
ONE
MAN
WOULD
SPEND
HIS
ETERNAL
LIFE
BEING
SCORCHED
FOR
HIS
WRONGDOINGS
