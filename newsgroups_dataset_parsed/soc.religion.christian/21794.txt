TRAVELING
FATIMA
WAS
RE
CONSECRATION
AND
ANNIVERSARY
HELLO
I
JUST
LIKE
TO
SHARE
THIS
ROSARY
AND
OTHER
PRAYER
PROPAGATION
PRACTICE
WE
DO
IN
MY
COUNTRY
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
IT
IS
GOING
ON
ALSO
HERE
IN
THE
US
OR
ANY
OTHER
COUNTRY
IN
ALL
THESE
YRS
IVE
BEEN
HERE
IN
ILLINOIS
USA
I
HAVE
NOT
ENCOUNTERED
IT
MAY
I
JUST
CALL
IT
TRAVELING
FATIMA
SINCE
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
AN
EXACT
TRANSLATION
OF
WHAT
WE
CALL
IT
IN
MY
NATIVE
LANGUAGE
FOR
CERTAIN
REGIONS
IN
A
DISTRICT
IN
A
TOWN
OR
CITY
AN
IMAGE
STATUE
OF
OUR
LADY
OF
FATIMA
IS
MOVED
FROM
ONE
HOME
ORIGINATING
FROM
OWNER
TO
ANOTHER
THIS
WILL
STAY
WITH
THAT
FAMILY
FOR
ONE
WEEK
AND
THIS
FAMILY
IS
REQUIRED
TO
PRAY
THE
ROSARY
AND
OTHER
PRAYERS
PRAYER
SHEETS
ACCOMPANY
THE
IMAGE
TO
OUR
LADY
OF
FATIMA
THE
MOVE
WILL
BE
LIKE
A
SIMPLE
PROCESSION
OF
FOLKS
PICKING
UP
THE
IMAGE
FROM
ITS
CURRENT
HOME
AFTER
DEPARTING
PRAYERS
AND
PROCEEDS
TO
MOVE
IT
TO
THE
NEXT
HOME
WHICH
HAS
THE
PRIOR
NOTIFICATION
ABOUT
THE
MOVE
THERE
WILL
BE
THE
RECEIVING
PRAYERS
AT
THE
NEXT
HOME
TO
WELCOME
OUR
LADY
OF
FATIMA
IMAGE
THERE
IT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
BE
THAT
ONLY
MEMBERS
OF
THE
FAMILY
IN
THAT
HOME
WHO
MUST
PRAY
TO
THE
IMAGE
THEY
MAY
INVITE
OTHERS
OR
OTHERSFRIENDS
CAN
INVITE
THEMSELVES
IN
TO
PARTICIPATE
DURING
PRAYER
TIME
IN
THAT
NEW
HOME
EVERYDAY
FOR
ONE
WEEK
THIS
IMAGE
IS
MOVED
FROM
ONE
FAMILY
TO
THE
NEXT
WITHIN
THE
BOUNDED
REGION
OF
THAT
DISTRICT
UNTIL
IT
GOES
BACK
TO
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
IMAGE
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
GOING
ON
AROUND
THERE
PHILIPPINES
RIGHT
NOW
OR
SOMEBODY
CORRECT
ME
WHEN
EXACTLY
SINCE
I
FORGOT
AND
EVERY
YEAR
THIS
IS
PART
OF
OUR
DEVOTION
TO
OUR
LADY
OF
FATIMA
IT
HAS
BEEN
EASY
TO
FACILITATE
THIS
BACK
HOME
BECAUSE
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
YOUR
NEXT
DOOR
NEIGHBOR
IS
A
CATHOLIC
AND
THE
IMAGE
THEN
IS
JUST
MOVED
NEXT
DOOR
I
AM
THINKING
OF
STARTING
SOMETHING
LIKE
IT
IN
THE
VILLAGE
WHERE
MY
SISTER
AND
HER
FAMILY
LIVES
MOST
OF
OUR
FRIENDS
AND
NEIGHBORS
THERE
ARE
CATHOLICS
AND
PRACTICING
ONES
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
STATECOMMUNITY
LAWS
THAT
THIS
PRACTICE
WILL
VIOLATE
WHATSOEVER
BEFORE
I
GO
FOR
IT
THANK
YOU
FOR
ANY
COMMENTS
OR

MATTER
