JHPBSARTOBUDDLAKENJUS
JOSEPH
H
BUEHLER
WRITES
CATHOLICS
VIEW
THE
EFFECTS
OF
BAPTISM
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENTLY
AND
THATS
ONE
PRIMARY
REASON
WHY
THEY
BAPTIZE
BABIES
THEY
BELIEVE
THAT
BAPTISM
PRODUCES
A
CHANGE
IN
THE
SOUL
OF
THE
BABY
QUITE
INDEPENDENTLY
OF
ANY
VOLITIONAL
ACT
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
BABY
THIS
CHANGE
IN
THE
BABYS
SOUL
GIVES
THE
INFANT
CERTAIN
CAPABILITIES
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
WITHOUT
BAPTISM
SINCE
THE
INFANT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
USE
OF
HIS
INTELLECT
AND
WILL
YET
THESE
NEW
FACULTIES
ARE
DORMANT
BUT
AS
THE
CHILD
GETS
OLDER
THE
GIFTS
OF
BAPTISM
COME
MORE
AND
MORE
INTO
PLAY
I
GUESS
I
WOULD
REACT
RATHER
STRONGLY
TO
THIS
LINE
OF
THINKING
CARRIED
OUT
WHEN
YOU
THINK
YOUR
ARMY
IS
STRONGER
THAN
MINE
YOU
WOULD
RIGHTEOUSLY
TAKE
MY
CHILDREN
AND
BAPTIZE
THEM
DOING
WHAT
YOU
KNOW
IS
REALLY
BEST
FOR
THEM
YOU
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
PUT
THIS
KIND
OF
ACTION
NOR
THE
CRUSADES
INTO
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
JESUSGOD
I
THINK
HE
ADVOCATED
A
DIFFERENT
APPROACH
THAT
WAS
BY
DESIGN
MADE
TO
BE
APPEALING
TO
THOSE
CALLED
BY
HIM
NOT
CHOSEN
BY
A
CHURCH
PRACTICE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
YOU
HAVE
THE
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
SWITCHED
THE
CHANGE
COMES
AND
THEN
YOU
GET
BAPTIZED
ANSWER
NOT
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
THOU
ALSO
BE
LIKE
UNTO
HIM
ANSWER
A
FOOL
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FOLLY
LEST
HE
BE
WISE
IN
HIS
OWN
CONCEIT
PROVERBS
