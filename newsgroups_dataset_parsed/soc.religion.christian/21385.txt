should
christians
fight
justifiable
war
i
posted
this
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
and
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
appeared
on
the
newsgroup
and
i
havent
had
a
reply
from
the
moderator
we
were
having
intermittent
problems
with
our
mail
at
the
time
please
excuse
me
if
you
have
seen
this
before
should
christians
fight
last
week
alastair
posted
some
questions
about
fighting
and
whether
there
are
such
things
as
justifiable
wars
i
have
started
looking
into
these
things
and
have
jotted
down
my
findings
as
i
go
i
havent
answered
all
his
questions
yet
and
i
know
what
i
have
here
is
on
a
slightly
different
tack
but
possibly
ill
be
able
to
get
into
it
more
deeply
later
and
post
some
more
info
soon
our
duty
to
our
neighbour
do
good
to
all
men
gal
love
our
neighbour
as
ourselves
matt
act
the
part
of
the
good
samaritan
luke
toward
any
who
may
be
in
trouble
we
will
therefore
render
every
possible
assistance
to
an
injured
man
and
therefore
should
not
be
part
of
any
organisation
which
causes
people
harm
even
medical
corps
of
the
army
etc
christians
are
by
faith
citizens
of
the
commonwealth
of
israel
ephesians
and
also
recognise
that
god
rules
in
the
kingdoms
of
men
and
therefore
we
should
not
be
taking
part
in
any
of
the
struggles
of
those
nations
which
we
are
not
part
of
due
to
our
faith
we
are
to
be
strangers
and
pilgrims
amongst
the
nations
so
we
are
just
passing
through
and
not
part
of
any
nation
or
any
national
aspirations
this
can
also
be
applied
to
politics
etc
but
thats
another
story
we
are
not
supposed
to
strive
or
resist
evil
even
suffer
yourselves
to
be
defrauded
it
is
therefore
incosistent
for
us
to
strive
to
assist
in
preserving
a
state
which
christ
will
destroy
when
he
returns
to
set
up
gods
kingdom
our
duty
to
the
state
render
therefore
unto
caesar
the
things
which
be
caesars
and
unto
god
the
things
which
be
gods
luke
let
every
soul
be
subject
unto
the
higher
powers
for
there
is
no
power
but
of
god
the
powers
that
be
are
ordained
of
god
whosoever
resisteth
the
power
resisteth
the
ordinance
of
god
rom
submit
yourselves
to
every
ordinance
of
man
for
the
lords
sake
whether
it
be
to
king
as
supreme
for
so
is
the
will
of
god
that
with
well
doing
ye
may
put
to
silence
the
ignorance
of
foolish
men
pet
these
scriptures
make
it
clear
that
submission
to
the
powers
that
be
is
a
divine
command
but
it
is
equally
clear
from
acts
that
when
any
ordinance
of
man
runs
counter
to
gods
law
we
must
refuse
submission
to
it
the
reason
for
this
is
that
we
are
gods
bond
servants
and
his
service
is
our
lifes
task
an
example
of
the
type
of
thing
is
in
col
where
bondservants
were
to
work
heartily
as
unto
the
lord
so
also
we
should
work
as
if
our
boss
was
god
ie
pressed
down
shaken
together
and
running
over
oops
a
bit
of
a
side
track
there
in
the
contests
between
the
nations
we
are
on
gods
side
a
side
that
is
not
fighting
in
the
battle
but
is
testifying
to
the
truth
when
we
believe
in
god
and
embrace
his
promises
we
become
fellow
citizens
with
the
saints
and
of
the
household
of
god
and
are
no
longer
interested
in
associations
of
the
world
think
of
this
in
relation
to
unions
etc
as
well
paul
tells
us
to
lay
aside
every
weight
that
we
may
run
the
race
that
is
set
before
us
and
if
we
are
wise
we
will
discard
any
association
which
would
retard
our
progress
thou
therefore
endure
hardness
as
a
good
soldier
of
jesus
christ
no
man
that
warreth
entangleth
himself
with
the
affairs
of
this
life
that
he
may
please
him
who
hath
chosen
him
to
be
a
soldier
tim
one
of
these
entanglements
he
warns
about
is
be
ye
not
unequally
yoked
together
with
unbelievers
one
of
the
obvious
applications
of
this
is
marriage
with
unbelievers
but
it
also
covers
things
like
business
partnerships
and
any
other
position
where
we
may
form
a
close
association
with
any
person
or
persons
not
believing
the
truth
about
god
in
this
case
the
army
the
principle
comes
from
deut
remember
that
as
well
as
them
being
different
animals
of
different
strengths
one
was
clean
and
one
unclean
under
the
law
these
ideas
are
strongly
stressed
in
cor
i
suggest
you
read
this
the
yoking
also
has
another
aspect
that
of
servitude
and
jesus
says
take
my
yoke
upon
you
so
we
are
then
yoked
with
christ
and
cannot
be
yoked
with
unbelievers
we
have
already
seen
that
we
are
bondservants
of
christ
and
paul
says
become
not
ye
the
bondservants
of
men
cor
rv
an
example
from
the
old
testament
the
question
is
asked
in
chr
shouldest
thou
help
the
ungodly
the
situation
here
is
a
good
example
of
what
happens
when
you
are
yoked
together
with
unbelievers
jehoshaphat
was
lucky
to
escape
with
his
life
here
are
the
facts
he
had
made
an
affinity
with
ahab
who
had
sold
himself
to
work
wickedness
before
the
lord
kings
when
asked
by
ahab
to
form
a
military
alliance
he
had
agreed
and
said
i
am
as
thou
art
my
people
as
thy
people
kings
an
unequal
yoking
he
sttod
firm
in
refusing
the
advice
of
the
false
prophets
and
insisted
on
hearing
the
prophet
of
the
lord
trying
to
do
the
right
thing
he
found
that
he
was
yoked
and
therefore
couldnt
break
away
from
the
evil
association
he
had
made
god
says
to
us
come
out
from
among
them
and
be
ye
separate
and
touch
not
the
unclean
thing
and
i
will
receive
you
and
ye
shall
be
my
sons
and
daughters
cor
this
is
more
or
less
what
i
have
found
out
so
far
im
still
looking
into
it
as
i
dont
think
ive
answered
all
the
questions
raised
by
alastair
yet
heres
a
summary
and
a
few
things
to
think
about
the
christian
in
under
command
obedience
to
this
command
is
an
essential
factor
in
his
relationship
with
christ
john
total
dedication
to
this
course
of
action
is
required
romans
disobedience
compromises
the
close
relationship
between
christ
and
his
followers
pet
we
are
to
be
separated
to
god
rom
this
involves
a
masterservant
relationship
rom
no
man
can
serve
two
masters
matt
all
that
is
in
the
kosmos
is
lust
and
pride
quite
opposed
to
gos
john
christs
kingdom
is
not
of
this
world
ie
not
worldly
in
nature
if
it
was
his
servants
would
fight
to
deliver
him
if
christ
is
our
master
and
he
was
not
delivered
by
his
servants
because
his
kingdom
was
not
of
this
world
then
his
servants
cannot
possibly
fight
for
another
master
strangers
and
pilgrims
have
no
rights
and
we
cannot
swear
allegiance
to
anyone
but
god
the
servant
of
the
lord
must
not
war
but
be
gentle
to
all
tim
this
does
not
just
apply
to
war
but
also
to
avoiding
strife
throughout
our
lives
there
is
a
war
to
be
waged
not
with
mans
weapons
cor
but
with
gods
armour
ill
probably
post
some
more
when
ive
had
time
to
look
into
things
a
bit
further
