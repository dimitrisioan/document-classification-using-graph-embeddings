OFF
OF
SHARONS
RESP
BUT

ALSO
LIKE
TO
ADD
SOME
MORE
VERSES
TO
THAT

PERHAPS
ANSWER
THE
SECOND
Q
VERSES
CORINTHIANS
COLOSSIANS
AS
FOR
KNOWING
WHEN
THATS
A
BIT
TRICKY
PEOPLE
NORMALLY
HAVE
CONSCIENCES
WHICH
WARN
THEM
ABOUT
IT
HOWEVER
AS
IN
MY

A
CONSCIENCE
CAN
BE
HARDENED

DECEITFULNESS
HEBREWS

THAT
THE
PERSON
HAS
NO
IDEA

DOESNT
CARE
ABOUT
IT

SINNING

THERE
ARE
THOSE
SINS

WE
DO
WHEN
WE
DONT

EXAMINING

BEST
QUESTION
TO
ASK
IN
EVERY
CIRCUMSTANCE
TO
JUDGE

A
COPOUT
