re
sin
sorry
for
taking
this
off
of
sharons
resp
but
id
also
like
to
add
some
more
verses
to
that
and
perhaps
answer
the
second
q
verses
corinthians
colossians
as
for
knowing
when
thats
a
bit
tricky
people
normally
have
consciences
which
warn
them
about
it
however
as
in
my
case
a
conscience
can
be
hardened
by
sins
deceitfulness
hebrews
so
that
the
person
has
no
idea
or
doesnt
care
about
it
that
they
are
sinning
of
course
there
are
those
sins
which
we
do
when
we
dont
know
that
theyre
sinful
to
begin
with
those
take
searching
and
examining
of
scripture
to
find
out
that
they
are
sinful
and
then
repent
and
change
the
best
question
to
ask
in
every
circumstance
to
judge
sinful
possibilities
is
would
jesus
wholeheartedly
do
this
at
this
point
in
time
i
know
it
sounds
like
a
copout
but
it
truly
is
a
stifling
question
