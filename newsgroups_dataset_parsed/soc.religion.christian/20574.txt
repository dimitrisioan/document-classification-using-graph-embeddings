WRITES
NOT
HONORING
OUR
WIVES
CAN
CAUSE
OUR
PRAYERS
TO
BE
HINDERED
YOU
HUSBANDS
LIKEWISE
LIVE
WITH
YOUR
WIVES
IN
AN
UNDERSTANDING
WAY
AS
WITH
A
WEAKER
VESSEL
SINCE
SHE
IS
A
WOMAN
AND
GRANT
HER
HONOR
AS
A
FELLOW
HEIR
OF
THE
GRACE
OF
LIFE
SO
THAT
YOUR
PRAYERS
MAY
NOT
BE
HINDERED

PETER
ONE
INTERPRETATION
IVE
HEARD
OF
THIS
VERSE
IS
THAT
IT
REFERS
TO
THE
SIN
OF
PHYSICALLY
ABUSING
ONES
WIFE
THE
HUSBAND
IS
USUALLY
PHYSICALLY
STRONGER
THAN
HIS
WIFE
BUT
IS
NOT
PERMITTED
TO
USE
THIS
TO
DOMINATE
HER
HE
MUST
HONOR
HER
AS
HIS
SISTER
IN
CHRIST
THIS
WOULD
THEREFORE
BE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
SPECIFIC
SIN
THAT
BLOCKS
PRAYER
THIS
VERSE
ALSO
MAKES
ME
THINK
OF
THE
KIND
OF
HUSBAND
WHO
DECIDES
WHAT
IS
GODS
WILL
FOR
HIS
FAMILY
WITHOUT
CONSULTING
HIS
WIFE
GOD
REVEALS
HIS
WILL
TO
BOTH
THE
HUSBAND
AND
THE
WIFE
THERE
NEEDS
TO
BE
SOME
DEGREE
OF
MUTUALITY
IN
DECISION
MAKING
EVEN
THOSE
WHOSE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
BIBLE
LEADS
TO
A
BELIEF
IN
AN
AUTHORITARIAN
HEADSHIP
OF
THE
HUSBAND
NEED
TO
INCORPORATE
THIS
IN
ORDER
TO
HAVE
A
FUNCTIONAL
FAMILY
ONE
WAY
TO
LOOK
AT
IT
IS
THAT
GOD
SPEAKS
TO
THE
WIFE
THROUGH
THE
HUSBAND
AND
TO
THE
HUSBAND
THROUGH
THE
WIFE
