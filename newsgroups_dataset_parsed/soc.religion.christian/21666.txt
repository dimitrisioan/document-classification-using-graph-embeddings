I
CAN
SEE
THAT
SOME
OF
THE
ABOVE
VERSES
DO
NOT
CLEARLY
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUES
HOWEVER
A
COUPLE
OF
THEM
SEEM
AS
THOUGH
THEY
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
INCREDIBLY
PERVERSE
INTERPRETATIONS
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
SEEN
AS
CONDEMNING
HOMOSEXUALITY
WOULD
SOMEONE
CARE
TO
COMMENT
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ABOVE
SEEMS
TO
SAY
FORNICATORS
WILL
NOT
INHERIT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
HOW
DOES
THIS
APPLY
TO
HOMOSEXUALS
I
UNDERSTAND
FORNICATION
TO
BE
SEX
OUTSIDE
OF
MARRIAGE
IS
THIS
AN
ACCURATE
DEFINITION
IS
THERE
ANY
SUCH
THING
AS
SAMESEX
MARRIAGE
IN
THE
BIBLE
MY
UNDERSTANDING
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THAT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
BLESSES
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
ONLY
BETWEEN
A
HUSBAND
AND
HIS
WIFE
I
AM
HOWEVER
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
TO
SCRIPTURAL
EVIDENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
IF
WE
TAKE
THINGS
THIS
LITERALLY
THEN
WE
MUST
ALSO
FORBID
WOMEN
FROM
SPEAKING
IN
CHURCH
PAUL
WHILE
LED
BY
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
WAS
HUMAN
AND
COULD
ERR
I
FIND
IT
INTERESTING
THAT
CHRIST
NEVER
DISCUSSED
THE
ISSUE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
CERTAINLY
IT
EXISTED
BACK
THEN
AND
IF
IT
WAS
A
SERIOUS
TRANSGRESSION
CHRIST
WOULD
HAVE
CONDEMNED
IT
I
FIND
IT
DISTURBING
THAT
THE
MODERN
CHURCH
SPENDS
ITS
ENERGY
TRYING
TO
STAMP
OUT
SOMETHING
THAT
CHRIST
DIDNT
CONSIDER
WORTH
A
SINGLE
WORD
OF
CONDEMNATION
CHRIST
REPEATEDLY
WARNS
US
AGAINST
JUDGEMENT
DONT
WE
RISK
JUDGEMENT
IN
EQUAL
MEASURE
WHEN
WE
CONDEMN
PEOPLE
WHO
GOD
HIMSELF
DID
NOT
JUDGE
WHEN
HE
WALKED
ON
THE
EARTH
THE
LOVE
OF
CHRIST
IS
CONTAGIOUS
I
SHOULD
NOT
THAT
MANY
OF
OUR
READERS
DO
IN
FACT
ADVOCATE
FORBIDING
WOMEN
FROM
SPEAKING
IN
CHURCH
THIS
IS
AN
ISSUE
WE
HAVE
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
PAST
AND
IM
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
REDOING
