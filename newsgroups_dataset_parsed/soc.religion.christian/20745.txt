RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
WHY
DO
WE
FOLLOW
GOD
SO
BLINDLY
HAVE
YOU
EVER
ASKED
A
PHYSICALLY
BLIND
PERSON
WHY
HE
OR
SHE
FOLLOWS
A
SEEING
EYE
DOG
THE
ANSWER
IS
QUITE
SIMPLETHE
DOG
CAN
SEE
AND
THE
BLIND
PERSON
CANNOT
OF
COURSE
YOU
MAY
ASK
IF
I
CANNOT
TRUST
MY
OWN
SENSES
HOW
DO
I
KNOW
WHETHER
WHAT
I
SEE
AND
HEAR
ABOUT
GOD
IS
TRUTH
OR
A
LIE
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
NEED
FAITH
TO
BE
SAVED
WE
MUST
FORCE
OURSELVES
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
KNOWS
THE
TRUTH
AND
LOVES
US
ENOUGH
TO
SHARE
IT
WITH
US
EVEN
WHEN
IT
DEFIES
WHAT
WE
THINK
WE
KNOW
WHY
WOULD
HE
HAVE
CREATED
US
IF
HE
DID
NOT
LOVE
US
ENOUGH
TO
HELP
US
THROUGH
THIS
WORLD
SEEMS
TO
ME
IF
YOU
LEARNED
TO
DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN
ILLUSION
AND
REALITY
ON
YOUR
OWN
YOU
WOULDNT
NEED
TO
RELY
ON
DOCTRINES
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
UPDATED
MY
EXPERIENCE
OF
CHRISTIANITY
YEARS
IS
THAT
MOST
CHRISTIANS
SEEK
ANSWERS
FROM
CLERGYMEN
WHO
HAVE
LITTLE
OR
NO
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
OF
SPIRITUAL
MATTERS
AND
THAT
MOST
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
CAN
BE
ANSWERED
BY
SIMPLE
INTROSPECTION
MOST
PEOPLE
SUSPECT
THAT
THEY
CANNOT
TRUST
THEIR
SENSES
BUT
FEW
TAKE
THE
NEXT
STEP
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THAT
THEY
CAN
TRUST
THEMSELVES
NOT
TO
GET
TOO
ESOTERIC
BUT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MOST
RELIGIONS
CHRISTIANITY
INCLUDED
ARE
FOUNDED
BY
PARTICULARLY
INTUITIVE
PEOPLE
WHO
UNDERSTAND
THIS
STUFF
DELETED
AS
FOR
YOU
NO
ONE
CAN
CONVERT
YOU
YOU
MUST
CHOOSE
TO
FOLLOW
GOD
OF
YOUR
OWN
WILL
IF
YOU
ARE
EVER
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
ALL
WE
AS
CHRISTIANS
WISH
TO
DO
IS
SHARE
WITH
YOU
THE
LOVE
WE
HAVE
RECEIVED
FROM
GOD
IF
YOU
REJECT
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
ACCEPT
YOUR
DECISION
ALTHOUGH
WE
ALWAYS
KEEP
THE
OFFER
OPEN
TO
YOU
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TO
FIND
OUT
WHY
WE
BELIEVE
WHAT
WE
BELIEVE
I
CAN
ONLY
SUGGEST
YOU
TRY
PRAYING
FOR
FAITH
READING
THE
BIBLE
AND
ASKING
CHRISTIANS
ABOUT
THEIR
EXPERIENCES
PERSONALLY
AND
WHAT
IF
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
PIXIE
IS
NEVER
CONVERTED
DOES
IT
MAKE
SENSE
THAT
SHE
OR
I
OR
THE
MAJORITY
OF
HUMANITY
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WOULD
GO
TO
HELL
FOR
ETERNITY
AS
MANY
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
IT
MAKES
MORE
SENSE
TO
ME
THAT
RATHER
THAN
BE
CONVERTED
TO
A
CENTURIESOLD
DOCTRINE
THAT
HOLDS
NO
LIFE
FOR
HER
THAT
SHE
SIMPLY
CONTINUE
TO
DECIDE
FOR
HERSELF
WHAT
IS
BEST
YOU
MAY
BE
RIGHT
ABOUT
CHRISTIANS
RELYING
ON
CLERGY
BUT
I
HAVE
SOME
REASON
TO
HOPE
YOURE
NOT
PROTESTANTS
EMPHASIZE
CONVERSION
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
AND
USE
OF
THE
BIBLE
THIS
IS
INTENDED
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
RELIGIOUS
EXPERIENCE
OF
THEIR
OWN
AND
THAT
THEY
HAVE
SOME
BASIS
ON
WHICH
TO
JUDGE
CLAIMS
OF
CLERGY
AND
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
I
CANT
SPEAK
FOR
CATHOLICS
AND
ORTHODOX
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THEY
ALSO
ATTEMPT
TO
AVOID
HAVING
MEMBERS
WHO
SIMPLY
REPEAT
WHAT
THEY
ARE
TOLD
I
ADMIT
THAT
THIS
ISNT
ALWAYS
SUCCESSFUL
WE
CERTAINLY
SEE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
JOIN
OUR
CHURCH
BECAUSE
AT
THAT
AGE
PARENTS
EXPECT
IT
BUT
MOST
OF
OUR
MEMBERS
DO
SEEM
QUITE
ABLE
AND
WILLING
TO
MAKE
JUDGEMENTS
FOR
THEMSELVES
AND
HAVE
A
COMMITMENT
THAT
COMES
OUT
OF
THEIR
OWN
EXPERIENCE
UNFORTUNATELY
ITS
THE
NATURE
OF
USENET
THAT
DOCTRINAL
DISAGREEMENTS
GET
EMPHASIZED
SO
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
WE
SPEND
MOST
OF
OUR
TIME
DEALING
WITH
DOCTRINE
THATS
CERTAINLY
NOT
MY
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
WAY
CHRISTIANS
REALLY
LIVE
CLH
