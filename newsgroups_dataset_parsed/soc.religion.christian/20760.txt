ASKED
US
WHETHER
WE
SHOULD
THINK
OF
THE
SERBS
AS
DOING
GODS
WORK
IN
BOSNIA
IVE
REFRAINED
FROM
POSTING
IN
HOPE
THAT
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
MORE
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
OT
THAN
I
WOULD
ANSWER
BUT
AT
THIS
POINT
I
FEEL
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
SOMETHING
MANY
THINGS
ABOUT
THIS
POSTING
BOTHER
ME
I
KNOW
OF
NOT
THE
SLIGHTEST
SUGGESTION
IN
THE
NT
THAT
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
USE
FORCE
TO
PROPAGATE
THE
GOSPEL
AND
THE
IDEA
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
DEATH
OF
MOSLEMS
VIOLATES
THE
HEART
OF
THE
GOSPEL
CHRIST
DIED
TO
BREAK
DOWN
THESE
DISTINCTIONS
IN
HIM
THERE
IS
NEITHER
JEW
NOR
GREEK
THERE
IS
NEITHER
SLAVE
NOR
FREE
THERE
IS
NEITHER
MALE
NOR
FEMALE
IF
MOSLEMS
DO
NOT
KNOW
HIM
WE
MAY
PREACH
TO
THEM
BUT
WE
DONT
KILL
THEM
FURTHERMORE
THE
ATTACK
IS
BETWEEN
STATES
NOT
RELIGIONS
THERE
ARE
CHRISTIANS
BEING
ATTACKED
AS
WELL
ONE
OF
THE
TOWNS
UNDER
ATTACK
IS
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
PLACES
WHERE
CHRISTIANS
AND
MOSLEMS
ARE
LIVING
TOGETHER
PEACEFULLY
THE
PRECEDENTS
BEING
SUGGESTED
ARE
FROM
THE
OT
THERE
ARE
IN
FACT
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
BEING
ALLUDED
TO
THE
FIRST
IS
FROM
THE
ENTRY
INTO
CANAAN
FOR
THAT
TO
BE
A
PARALLEL
WE
WOULD
NEED
FOR
GOD
TO
HAVE
PROMISED
THIS
LAND
THROUGH
A
PROPHET
AND
WE
WOULD
NEED
THE
WAR
TO
BE
A
HOLY
WAR
THERE
WERE
TIGHT
CONSTRAINTS
ON
BEHAVIOR
IN
THOSE
ATTACKS
ANY
VIOLATIONS
WERE
LIKELY
TO
CAUSE
THE
ISRAELITES
TO
BE
DEFEATED
RAPE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
TOLERATED
WHILE
THE
ACCOUNTS
IN
JOSHUA
EMPHASIZE
TOWNS
THAT
WERE
TOTALLY
DESTROYED
NOTE
THAT
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
TOWN
TO
MAKE
PEACE
WITH
THE
ISRAELITES
AND
THAT
ONCE
THAT
WAS
DONE
EVEN
WHEN
DECEPTION
WAS
INVOLVED
THEY
WERE
EXPECTED
TO
HONOR
IT
IN
CONTRAST
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
MANY
VIOLATIONS
OF
AGREEMENT
IN
THIS
INCIDENT
I
SEE
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
GOD
HAS
GRANTED
BOSNIA
TO
THE
SERBS
AS
A
PROMISED
LAND
AND
IF
HE
HAD
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
WOULD
HAVE
DISQUALIFIED
THIS
FROM
BEING
A
HOLY
WAR
THE
OTHER
OT
PARALLEL
IS
FROM
LATER
WHEN
ISRAEL
WAS
DEFEATED
BY
ASSYRIA
AND
BABYLONIA
THE
PROPHETS
SAW
THIS
AS
A
JUDGEMENT
ON
ISRAEL
FOR
HER
SINS
SOMEONE
ASKS
WHETHER
WE
SHOULDNT
SEE
THIS
AS
A
JUDGEMENT
ON
THE
BOSNIANS
FOR
THEIR
SINS
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
REPLAY
OF
THE
OLD
CLAIM
THAT
WE
SHOULDNT
HAVE
DOCTORS
OR
HOSPITALS
BECAUSE
ILLNESS
IS
GODS
JUDGEMENT
YES
EVEN
BAD
THINGS
MAY
BE
USED
BY
GOD
FOR
GOOD
THAT
INCLUDES
ACTIONS
OF
BAD
PEOPLE
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
JUSTIFY
THEM
IF
YOU
READ
THE
PROPHETS
YOU
FIND
THEM
VERY
CLEAR
THAT
IN
ATTACKING
ISRAEL
THE
ASSYRIANS
AND
BABYLONIANS
WERE
ACTING
AS
UNINTENTIONAL
AGENTS
OF
GOD
THEIR
INTENT
WAS
TO
ATTACK
GODS
PEOPLE
AND
THEY
WOULD
BE
JUDGED
FOR
IT
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
WERE
ACTUALLY
CARRYING
OUT
GODS
PLAN
DIDNT
EXCUSE
THEIR
ACTION
FURTHERMORE
WE
SHOULDNT
CONCLUDE
FROM
THIS
THAT
ALL
ATTACKS
ARE
JUDGEMENTS
FROM
GOD
GOD
EXPLICITLY
INTERPRETED
THAT
CASE
THROUGH
HIS
PROPHETS
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
HE
DID
NOT
SEND
ANY
PROPHETS
TO
BOSNIA
WHILE
I
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
SEE
ANY
GOOD
IN
THE
CURRENT
FIGHTING
I
AM
SURE
GOD
WILL
EVENTUALLY
MAKE
GOOD
COME
OUT
OF
BAD
BUT
THAT
DOESNT
JUSTIFY
IT
AND
IT
WONT
SAVE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
DOING
IT
FROM
JUDGEMENT
I
AM
PARTICULARLY
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THIS
ISSUE
BECAUSE
OF
CURRENT
TENSIONS
BETWEEN
THE
WEST
AND
MOSLEMORIENTED
NATIONS
WHAT
WE
DO
NOT
NEED
IS
FOR
MOSLEMS
TO
CONCLUDE
THAT
CHRISTIANS
THINK
ITS
OK
TO
KILL
MOSLEMS
THE
IMPLICATIONS
FOR
THE
MIDEAST
AND
EVEN
RELATIONS
WITH
AMERICAN
MOSLEMS
COULD
BE
QUITE
SERIOUS
