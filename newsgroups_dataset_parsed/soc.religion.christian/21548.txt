HMMMIN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
STORY
ABOUT
THE
TOWER
OF
BABEL
WE
SEE
HOW
GOD
PUNISHED
BY
GIVING
US
DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE
CAN
WE
ASSUME
THEN
THAT
IF
ANGELS
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
LANGUAGE
AT
ALL
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THE
SAME
ONE
AMONGST
OTHER
ANGELS
AFTER
ALL
THEY
WERE
NOT
PUNISHED
IN
ANY
MANNER
IF
THE
LANGUAGES
WE
SEPAK
ARE
THE
RESULT
OF
BABEL
THEN
IT
STANDS
TO
REASON
THAT
ANGELS
WOULD
SPEAK
A
DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE
FROM
US
YOU
DO
HAVE
A
VALID
POINT
ABOUT
MULTIPLE
ANGELIC
LANGUAGES
BUT
ANGELIC
BEINGS
MAYBE
OF
DIFFERENT
SPECIES
SO
TO
SPEAK
MAYBE
DIFFERENT
SPECIES
COMMUNICATE
DIFFERENTLY
I
DONT
KNOW
EITHER
TRUTH
BE
KNOWN
SO
LITTLE
IS
KNOWN
OF
ANGELS
TO
EVEN
GUESS
ALL
WE
REALLY
KNOW
IS
THAT
ANGELS
ALWAYS
SPEAK
IN
THE
NATIV
TONGUE
OF
THE
PERSON
THEYRE
TALKING
TO
SO
PERHAPS
THEY
DONT
HAVE
ANY
LANGUAGE
OF
THEIR
OWN
TROUBLE
IS
WHILE
SUCH
STORIES
ABOUND
ANY
AND
ALL
ATTEMPTS
AT
VERIFICATION
AND
WE
ARE
TO
TEST
THE
SPIRIT
EITHER
SHOW
THAT
THE
WITNESS
HAD
NO
REAL
IDEA
OF
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OR
THAT
OUTRIGHT
FABRICATION
WAS
INVOLVED
THE
BROTHER
PUKA
STORY
IN
A
PREVIOUS
POST
SEEMS
LIKE
A
FRIEND
OF
A
FRIEND
THING
AND
LINGUISTICALLY
A
TWO
SYLLABLE
WORD
HARDLY
QUALIFIES
AS
LANGUAGE
INFLECTION
OR
NO
I
HAVE
HEARD
AN
EYEWITNESS
ACCOUNT
MYSELF
SUCH
THINGS
ARE
HARD
TO
PROVE
THEY
DONT
LEND
THEMSELVES
TO
A
LABORATORY
THING
VERY
WELL
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
IS
A
VERY
HOLY
THING
TO
TAKE
GIFTS
INTO
A
LABORATORY
ANYWAY
WELL
WE
ARE
TOLD
TO
TEST
THE
SPIRITS
WHILE
YOU
COULD
DO
THIS
SCRIPTURALLY
TO
SEE
IF
SOMEONES
CLAIMS
ARE
BACKED
BY
THE
BIBLE
I
SEE
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
MAKING
SURE
THAT
THAT
GUY
LAZARUS
REALLY
WAS
DEAD
AND
NOW
HES
ALIVE
MUCH
AS
MANY
FAITH
HEALERS
HAVE
TROUBLE
PROVING
THEIR
VICTORIES
SINCE
MOST
AILMENTS
CURED
ARE
JUST
PLAIN
UNPROVABLE
AND
MODERN
DAY
RESSURRECTIONS
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
VALIDATED
SO
IS
IT
TRUE
THAT
NO
MODERN
DAY
XENOGLOSSOLALIA
HAS
BEEN
PROVED
BY
CLERGY
OR
LAY
THATS
AN
UNPROVABLE
STATEMENT
HOW
CAN
YOU
PROVE
IF
SOMETHINGS
BEEN
PROVED
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
KNOW
THAT
YOUVE
SEEN
ALL
THE
EVIDENCE
ONCE
I
SAW
AN
ORTHODONTISTS
RECORDS
COMPLETE
WITH
PHOTOGRAPHS
SHOWING
HOW
ONE
OF
HIS
PATIENTS
SEVERE
UNDERBITE
WAS
CURED
BY
CONSTANT
PRAYER
ITS
A
COMMON
FALLACY
YOU
COMMIT
THE
NONFALSIFIABILITY
TRICK
HOW
CAN
I
PROVE
IT
WHEN
NOT
ALL
THE
EVIDENCE
MAY
BE
SEEN
ANSWER
I
CANT
THE
FALLACY
IS
IN
ASSUMING
THAT
IT
IS
UP
TO
ME
TO
PROVE
ANYTHING
WHEN
I
SAY
IT
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
PROVEN
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
ONES
MAKING
THE
CLAIMS
NOT
THE
SKEPTICS
WHO
ARE
DOING
THE
PROVING
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
REST
WITH
THE
CLAIMANT
UNFORTUNATELY
PONTIFICATION
WARNING
OUR
LEGAL
SYSTEM
SEEMS
TO
BE
HEADED
IN
THE
DANGEROUS
REALM
OF
MAKING
PEOPLE
PROVE
THEIR
INNOCENCE
END
PONTIFICATION
BUT
TRUTHFULLY
CORINTHIANS
WAS
SO
POORLY
WRITTEN
OR
MAYBE
JUST
SO
POORLY
TRANSLATED
INTO
ENGLISH
THAT
MUCH
REMAINS
UNKNOWN
ABOUT
JUST
WHAT
PAUL
REALLY
INTENDED
DESPITE
CLAIMS
OF
HARD
PROOF
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
SOME
WILL
SEE
HIS
WRITINGS
IN
COR
AS
SAYING
DONT
DO
THIS
DONT
DO
THIS
AND
USING
SARCASM
METAPHOR
ETC
WHILE
YET
OTHERS
TAKE
WHAT
HE
SAYS
LITERALLY
SARCASMS
AND
METAPHORS
NOTWITHSTANDING
ME
WHEN
I
READ
COR
ABOUT
PRAYINGSPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
REGARDING
BUILDING
ONESELFTHE
CHURCH
I
SEE
HIM
USING
COMPARECONTRAST
SAYING
DO
THIS
BECAUSE
IT
BUILD
THE
CHURCH
WHILE
DOING
THIS
BUILDS
ONSELF
IMPLYING
DONT
DO
THAT
ITS
A
COMMON
USAGE
OF
WRITING
THAT
WE
ALL
EMPLOY
AND
IT
IS
EASILY
SEEN
HOW
IT
COULD
BE
INTERPRETED
THIS
WAY
WHY
SOME
DO
AND
SOME
DONT
IS
A
MYSTERY
