RE
MORE
ON
PETER
IN
ARTICLE
JEKCUNIHGOV
WRITES
IN
ONE
SENSE
NO
STATEMENT
BY
ANOTHER
IS
SUBJECT
TO
MY
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
IF
RELIABLE
HISTORIANS
TELL
ME
THAT
THE
ATHENIANS
LOST
THE
PELOPENNESIAN
WAR
I
CANNOT
SIMPLY
INTERPRET
THIS
AWAY
BECAUSE
I
WANTED
THE
ATHENIANS
TO
WIN
FACTS
ARE
FACTS
AND
DO
NOT
GO
AWAY
BECAUSE
I
WANT
THEM
TO
BE
OTHERWISE
IN
ANOTHER
SENSE
EVERY
STATEMENT
IS
SUBJECT
TO
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
IN
THAT
I
HAVE
TO
DEPEND
ON
MY
BRAINS
AND
EXPEREIENCE
TO
DECIDE
WHAT
IT
MEANS
AND
WHETHER
IT
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
WELL
ATTESTED
TO
MERIT
MY
ASSENT
EVEN
IF
THE
STATEMENT
OCCURS
IN
AN
INSPIRED
WRITING
I
STILL
HAVE
TO
DECIDE
USING
MY
OWN
BEST
JUDGEMENT
WHETHER
IT
IS
IN
FACT
INSPIRED
THIS
IS
NOT
ARROGANCE
IT
IS
JUST
AN
INESCAPABLE
FACT
YES
THERE
ARE
THESE
TWO
SENSES
OF
INTERPRETATION
AND
CERTAINLY
OUR
DECISION
TO
ACCEPT
SCRIPTURE
AS
INSPIRED
ULTIMATELY
RESTS
ON
OUR
OWN
PRIVATE
OPINION
HOWEVER
WHEN
READING
SCRIPTURE
WE
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
SCRIPTURES
WERE
GIVEN
BY
GOD
FOR
OUR
INSTRUCTION
AND
THAT
THE
INTERPRETATION
THAT
MATTERS
IS
THE
ONE
GOD
INTENDED
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
I
DECIDE
THAT
THE
FACT
THAT
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
IS
ELIJAH
TEACHES
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
REINCARNATION
I
AM
WRONG
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
INTENDED
INTERPRETATION
THE
PROPHETS
DIDNT
MAKE
UP
THIS
TEACHING
IT
CAME
FROM
GOD
AND
WE
MUST
ACCEPT
IT
AS
SUCH
THIS
NECESSARILY
MEANS
THAT
OUR
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATIONS
MUST
TAKE
A
BACK
SEAT
TO
THE
MEANING
GOD
INTENDED
TO
CONVEY
CERTAINLY
WE
MUST
RELY
ON
OUR
BEST
EFFORTS
TO
DETERMINE
WHAT
THIS
MEANING
IS
BUT
THIS
VERY
FACT
SHOULD
MAKE
US
RECOGNIZE
THAT
OUR
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATIONS
CANNOT
BE
AUTOMATICALLY
ACCEPTED
AS
THE
INFALLIBLE
INTERPRETATION
OF
GOD
WE
NEED
TO
TEST
THE
SPIRITS
TO
SEE
IF
THEY
ARE
FROM
GOD
WHEN
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
SPEAKS
HE
SAYS
THE
SAME
THING
TO
ALL
HE
WONT
TELL
ME
THAT
A
PASSAGE
MEANS
ONE
THING
AND
TELL
YOU
IT
MEANS
ANOTHER
IF
THE
TWO
OF
US
COME
TO
CONFLICTING
CONCLUSIONS
WE
CANT
BOTH
BE
COMPLETELY
RIGHT
WE
KNOW
OUR
INTERPRETATIONS
ARE
RELIABLE
ONLY
WHEN
THE
CHURCH
AS
A
WHOLE
AGREES
ON
WHAT
SCRIPTURE
MEANS
THIS
IS
HOW
WE
KNOW
THE
DOCTRINES
OF
THE
TRINITY
THE
DUAL
NATURE
OF
CHRIST
ETC
INFALLIBLY
THESE
MATTERS
ARE
NOT
UP
FOR
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
PETER
GOES
ON
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THE
DECEPTIVENESS
OF
THE
FALSE
TEACHERS
THEY
PREFERRED
THEIR
OWN
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
TO
THE
GODGIVEN
TEACHING
OF
THE
APOSTLES
IT
IS
THROUGH
SUCH
PRIVATE
INTERPRETATION
THAT
THE
TRADITIONS
OF
MEN
SO
SOUNDLY
DENOUNCED
IN
SCRIPTURE
ARE
STARTED
TONY
