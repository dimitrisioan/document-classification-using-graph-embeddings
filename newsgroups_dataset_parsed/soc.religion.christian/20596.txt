CHRISTIANS

WRITES
ARE
ALL
TRUTHS
ALSO
ABSOLUTES
IS
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
TRUTHS
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTES
IF
THE
ANSWER
TO
EITHER
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
IS
NO
THEN
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
HOW
YOU
DETERMINE
WHICH
PARTS
OF
SCRIPTURE
ARE
TRUTHS
AND
WHICH
TRUTHS
ARE
ABSOLUTES
THE
ANSWER
TO
BOTH
QUESTIONS
IS
YES
PERHAPS
WE
HAVE
DIFFERENT
DEFINITIONS
OF
ABSOLUTE
THEN
TO
ME
AN
ABSOLUTE
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
CONSTANT
ACROSS
TIME
CULTURE
SITUATIONS
ETC
TRUE
IN
EVERY
INSTANCE
POSSIBLE
DO
YOU
AGREE
WITH
THIS
DEFINITION
I
THINK
YOU
DO
SIMILARLY
ALL
TRUTH
IS
ABSOLUTE
INDEED
A
NONABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IS
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
WHEN
IS
SOMETHING
ABSOLUTE
WHEN
IT
IS
ALWAYS
TRUE
OBVIOUSLY
IF
A
TRUTH
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
TRUE
THEN
WE
HAVE
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
A
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
SORRY
I
DONT
HAVE
A
BIBLE
AT
WORK
AND
CANT
PROVIDE
A
REFERENCE
WOMEN
ARE
INSTRUCTED
TO
BE
SILENT
AND
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
IN
CHURCH
NOW
THIS
IS
SCRIPTURE
BY
YOUR
DEFINITION
THIS
IS
TRUTH
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTE
DO
WOMEN
IN
YOUR
CHURCH
SPEAK
DO
THEY
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
IF
ALL
SCRIPTURE
IS
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
WOMEN
SPEAKING
IN
AND
COMING
TO
CHURCH
WITH
BARE
HEADS
SHOULD
BE
INTOLERABLE
TO
EVANGELICALS
YET
CLEARLY
WOMEN
DO
SPEAK
IN
EVANGELICAL
CHURCHES
AND
COME
WITH
BARE
HEADS
AT
LEAST
THIS
WAS
THE
CASE
IN
THE
EVANGELICAL
CHURCHES
I
GREW
UP
IN
EVANGELICALS
ARE
CLEARLY
NOT
TAKING
THIS
PARTICULAR
PART
OF
SCRIPTURE
TO
BE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AND
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
OTHER
EXAMPLES
CAN
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
MANY
PEOPLE
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
WORLD
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
IS
TERRIBLY
SELFCONTRADICTORY
LET
ME
PUT
IT
TO
YOU
THIS
WAY
IF
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
SHOULDNT
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
STATEMENT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
IS
NOT
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE
OBVIOUSLY
WE
HAVE
A
CONTRADICTION
HERE
I
DONT
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
THOUGH
AND
DETERMINING
ABSOLUTES
IS
DIFFICULT
THIS
IS
JUST
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
WHY
CHRISTIANS
DEFY
THE
WORLD
BY
CLAIMING
THAT
THERE
ARE
INDEED
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
UNIVERSE
THERE
IS
HARDLY
CONSENSUS
EVEN
IN
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANITY
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
REST
OF
CHRISTIANITY
REGARDING
BIBLICAL
INTERPRETATION
SO
PEOPLE
SOMETIMES
DISAGREE
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
TRUE
THIS
DOES
NOT
NEGATE
THE
FACT
HOWEVER
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
UNIVERSE
BUT
YOU
ARE
CLAIMING
THAT
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
ABSOLUTE
HOW
CAN
YOU
DETERMINE
ABSOLUTES
DERIVED
FROM
SCRIPTURE
WHEN
YOU
CANT
AGREE
HOW
TO
INTERPRET
THE
SCRIPTURE
ITS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
HOW
YOU
CAN
CLAIM
SOMETHING
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
YOUR
OWN
INTERPRETATION
IS
ABSOLUTE
DO
YOU
DENY
THAT
YOUR
OWN
BACKGROUND
EDUCATION
PREJUDICES
ETC
COME
INTO
PLAY
WHEN
YOU
READ
THE
BIBLE
AND
DETERMINE
HOW
TO
INTERPRET
A
PASSSAGE
DO
YOU
DENY
THAT
YOU
IN
FACT
INTERPRET
