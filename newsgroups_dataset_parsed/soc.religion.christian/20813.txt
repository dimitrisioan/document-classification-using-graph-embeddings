RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
TO
WHAT
FOLLOWS
OUR
MODERATOR
HAS
ALREADY
ANSWERED
THE
CHARGE
OF
ARROGANCE
MORE
ABLY
THAT
I
COULD
HAVE
DONE
SO
SO
I
WILL
CONFINE
MYSELF
TO
ANSWERING
THE
CHARGE
OF
ILLOGIC
IN
A
PREVIOUS
ARTICLE
EUGENEBIGELOWEBAYSUNCOM
GENO
SAYS
IF
I
DONT
THINK
MY
BELIEF
IS
RIGHT
AND
EVERYONE
ELSES
BELIEF
IS
WRONG
THEN
I
DONT
HAVE
A
BELIEF
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
WHAT
BELIEF
MEANS
UNFORTUNATLY
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
HOW
CHRISTIANS
ARE
TAUGHT
TO
THINK
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THEIR
RELIGION
THIS
IS
HOW
EVERYONE
IN
THE
WESTERN
INTELLECTUAL
TRADITION
IS
OR
WAS
TAUGHT
TO
THINK
IT
IS
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
PREMIS
A
IS
NOT
NOTA
IF
A
THING
IS
TRUE
THEN
ITS
CONVERSE
IS
NECESSARILLY
FALSE
WITHOUT
THIS
BASIC
ASUMPTION
THEOLOGY
AND
SCIENCE
AS
WE
KNOW
THEM
ARE
ALIKE
IMPOSSIBLE
WE
SHOULD
DISTINGUISH
THE
STRONG
AND
WEAK
MEANINGS
OF
THE
WORD
BELIEVE
HOWEVER
THE
WEAK
SENSE
MEANS
I
AM
NOT
SURE
I
BELIEVE
TOM
WENT
TO
THE
LIBRARY
BUT
HE
COULD
HAVE
GONE
TO
THE
TRACK
THE
STRONG
SENSE
MEANS
I
AM
SO
CERTAIN
THAT
I
USE
IT
AS
A
BASIS
OF
THOUGHT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
NATURE
OPERATES
ACCORDING
TO
CERTAIN
FUNDAMENTAL
LAWS
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
NATURE
APPEARS
CAPRICIOUS
AND
UNPREDICTABLE
CHRISTIAN
BELIEF
IS
OF
THE
STRONG
KIND
THOUGH
CHRISTIANS
MAY
WELL
HOLD
BELIEFS
OF
THE
WEAK
KIND
ON
ANY
NUMBER
OF
THEOLOGICAL
AND
ECCLESIOLOGICAL
TOPICS
SOME
TAKE
IT
TO
THE
EXTREME
AND
SAY
THAT
THEIR
RELIGION
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
AND
IF
YOU
DONT
ACCEPT
THEIR
TEACHINGS
THEN
YOU
WONT
BE
SAVED
NOTE
THAT
THESE
ARE
TWO
SEPARATE
IDEAS
MOST
HOLD
THE
FIRST
VIEW
BUT
THE
MAJORITY
DO
NOT
HOLD
THE
SECOND
IS
IS
AGAIN
A
MATTER
OF
PURE
LOGIC
THAT
IF
CHRISTANITY
IS
TRUE
THEN
HINDUISM
FOR
EXAMPLE
MUST
NECESSARILLY
BE
FALSE
INSOFAR
AS
IT
CONTRADICTS
OR
IS
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTAIANITY
AND
AS
A
MATTER
OF
LOGIC
VICE
VERSA
IT
TAKES
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
ARROGANCE
TO
CLAIM
TO
KNOW
WHAT
GOD
THINKSWANTS
IT
IS
ARROGANT
TO
CLAIM
TO
KNOW
WHAT
ANYONE
THINKS
OR
WANTS
UNLESS
THEY
HAVE
TOLD
YOU
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
GOD
HAS
TOLD
US
WHAT
HE
THINKS
AND
WANTS
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
ITS
BASED
UPON
YOUR
INTERPRETATION
OF
A
BOOK
MOST
CHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
BASE
THEIR
BELIEF
ON
THE
BIBLE
BUT
ON
THE
LIVING
TRADITION
OF
THE
CHURCH
ESTABLISHED
BY
CHRIST
AND
GUIDED
CONSTANTLY
BY
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THE
BIBLE
IS
SIMPLY
THE
WRITTEN
CORE
OF
THAT
TRADITION
THE
LOGIC
IN
THE
ABOVE
STATEMENT
IS
FAULTY
IN
THAT
IT
ASSUMES
TWO
PEOPLE
WITH
DIFFERING
BELIEFS
CANT
BOTH
BE
CORRECT
IF
DEPENDS
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
DIFFERING
IF
I
BELIEVE
TOM
IS
SIX
FEET
TALL
AND
YOU
BELIEVE
HE
WEIGHS
POUNDS
OUR
BELIEFS
DIFFER
BUT
WE
MAY
BOTH
BE
RIGHT
IF
I
BELIEVE
TOM
IS
SIX
FEET
TALL
AND
YOU
BELEIVE
THAT
HE
IS
FOUR
FOOT
NINE
ONE
OF
US
AT
LEAST
MUST
BE
WRONG
ITS
ALL
ABOUT
PERCEPTION
NO
TWO
PEOPLE
ARE
EXACTLY
ALIKE
NO
TWO
PEOPLE
PERCEIVE
EVERYTHING
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
IS
ONE
TRUTH
CALL
IT
GODS
TRUTH
A
UNIVERSAL
TRUTH
OR
CALL
IT
WHAT
YOU
WILL
I
DONT
BELIEVE
GOD
PRESENTS
THIS
TRUTH
I
THINK
IT
IS
JUST
THERE
AND
ITS
UP
TO
YOU
TO
LOOK
FOR
AND
SEE
IT
THROUGH
PRAYER
MEDITATION
INSPIR
ATION
DREAMS
OR
WHATEVER
JUST
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
MAY
PERCEIVE
THIS
TRUTH
DIFFERENTLY
IT
DOESNT
MEAN
ONE
IS
WRONG
AND
THE
OTHER
IS
RIGHT
THUS
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
SINGLE
TRUTH
BUT
THAT
NO
HUMAN
BEING
CAN
FIND
IT
YOU
ASSERT
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
CAN
FIND
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IS
MISTAKEN
IN
SHORT
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
DOES
NOT
SHARE
YOUR
BELIEF
ON
THIS
POINT
IS
WRONG
QED
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
TAKE
THE
QUESTION
IS
THE
GLASS
HALF
EMPTY
OR
HALF
FULL
YOU
CAN
HAVE
TWO
DIFFERENT
ANSWERS
WHICH
ARE
CONTRADICTORY
AND
YET
BOTH
ARE
CORRECT
SO
FOR
YOUR
BELIEF
TO
BE
TRUE
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
EVERYONE
ELSES
BELIEF
TO
BE
WRONG
HERE
I
BEGIN
TO
SUSPECT
THAT
YOUR
REAL
DIFFICULTY
IS
NOT
WITH
THE
KNOWABILITY
OF
TRUTH
BUT
SIMPLY
WITH
LANGUAGE
SAYING
THAT
THE
GLASS
IS
HALF
EMPTY
IS
NOT
A
CONTRADICTION
OF
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
IT
IS
HALF
FULL
IT
IS
THE
SAME
FACT
EXPRESSED
IN
DIFFERENT
WORDS
THE
WHOLE
POINT
OF
THIS
PHRASE
IS
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
DIFFERENT
WAYS
THE
PESSIMIST
AND
THE
OPTIMIST
EXPRESS
THE
SAME
FACT
IT
IS
OF
COURSE
QUITE
TRUE
THAT
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
MAY
EXPRESS
THE
SAME
BELIEF
IN
DIFFERENT
WORDS
IT
IS
ALSO
TRUE
THAT
THEY
MAY
FAIL
TO
UNDERSTAND
EACH
OTHERS
WORDS
AS
EXPRESSIONS
OF
THE
SAME
BELIEF
AND
MAY
ARGUE
BITTERLY
AND
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
ARE
MILES
APART
GREAT
SCISMS
HAVE
OCCURRED
IN
JUST
THIS
WAY
AND
MUCH
ECUMENICAL
WORK
HAS
BEEN
DONE
SIMPLY
IN
RESOLVING
DIFFERENCES
IN
LANGUAGE
WHICH
CONCEAL
AGREEMENT
IN
BELIEF
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
IN
ANY
SENSE
THAT
ALL
BELIEFS
ARE
EQUALLY
VALID
SINCE
SOME
OF
THE
BELIEFS
PEOPLE
HOLD
CONTRADICT
SOME
OTHER
BELIEFS
THAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
HOLD
AFTER
ALL
OBFUSCATIONS
OF
LANGUAGE
AND
CULTURE
IN
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
THOSE
BELIEFS
HAVE
BEEN
STRIPPED
AWAY
SOME
OF
THE
BELIEFS
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
HOLD
MUST
NECESSARILLY
BE
FALSE
AND
IT
IS
NEITHER
ARROGANT
NOR
ILLOGICAL
TO
SAY
SO
IF
I
BELIEVE
X
AND
YOU
BELIEVE
Y
WE
MAY
BOTH
BE
CORRECT
BUT
IF
Y
IS
EQUIVALENT
TO
NOTX
THEN
ONE
OF
US
IS
WRONG
AND
AS
LONG
AS
WE
HOLD
OUR
RESPECTIVE
BELIEFS
WE
MUST
EACH
REGARD
THE
OTHER
AS
IN
ERROR
MARK
BAKER
THE
TASK
IS
NOT
TO
CUT
DOWN
JUNGLES
BUT
TO
IRRIGATE
DESERTS
