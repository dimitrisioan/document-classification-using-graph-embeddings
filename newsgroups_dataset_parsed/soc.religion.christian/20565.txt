CATHOLIC
LITURGY
THE
PROBLEMS
WITH
CATHOLIC
LITURGY
ARE
LIKELY
TO
CONTINUE
FOR
SOME
TIME
THE
PROBLEM
IS
IN
A
NUTSHELL
THIS
THE
LITURGY
IS
A
SYMBOLIC
ACTION
IN
OTHER
WORDS
CATHOLICS
DO
OR
SHOULD
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
SIGNS
DURING
THE
MASS
WATER
BLESSINGS
VESTMENTS
ALTAR
RELICS
ETC
ARE
REAL
THAT
IS
THE
SPRINKLING
OF
WATER
BESTOWS
REAL
ALMOST
TANGIBLE
HOLINESS
THE
VESTMENTS
ARE
A
REAL
INDICATION
OF
REAL
SACRED
TIME
THE
POINT
OF
A
SYMBOL
IS
THAT
IT
IS
UNDERSTOOD
BY
ALL
TO
BE
CONNECTED
TO
AN
UNDERLYING
REAL
REFERENT
THIS
KIND
OF
THINKING
PRECLUDES
ANALYSIS
HOLY
WATER
IS
NOT
HOLY
BECAUSE
OF
ANYTHING
IT
SIMPLY
IS
HOLY
BUT
MODERN
WESTERNERS
FIND
IT
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
ESPECIALLY
IF
WELL
EDUCATED
TO
THINK
OF
THE
MASS
AS
A
SYMBOL
WE
ARE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
SEE
IT
AS
A
SIGN
IE
AN
ACTION
THAT
REPRESENTS
GRACE
BUT
WHICH
COULD
BE
REPLACED
WITH
OTHER
SIGNS
IN
CONCRETE
TERMS
THIS
MEANS
THE
MASS
HAS
BECOME
A
COMMERCIAL
FOR
GODS
GRACE
RATHER
THAN
THE
REAL
THING
YOU
CAN
MESS
AROUND
WITH
A
COMMERCIAL
IN
A
WAY
YOU
WOULDNT
DARE
WITH
THE
REAL
THING
ASK
COCACOLA
CO
THESE
ATTITUDES
HAVE
BEEN
ENCOURAGED
BY
LITURGY
WORKSHOPS
ETC
WHICH
INSTEAD
OF
FOCUSING
ON
HOW
TO
DO
DO
LITURGY
HAVE
FOCUSED
ON
HOW
TO
CREATE
A
MEANING
IN
LITURGY
YOU
CAN
ONLY
CREATE
SIGNS
SYMBOLS
HAVE
TO
COME
FROM
GOD
OR
THE
HEART
OR
SOMEWHERE
DEEPER
THAN
ANALYSIS
THE
MOST
DRAMATIC
EXAMPLE
OF
THIS
SHIFT
IN
UNDERSTANDING
HAS
BEEN
IN
THE
TREATMENT
OF
THE
SACRED
SPECIES
THE
CONSECRATED
HOST
AND
WINE
NOW
WITH
PITA
BREAD
ETC
IT
IS
COMMON
TO
COME
AWAY
FROM
THE
ALTAR
WITH
HANDS
COVERED
IN
PARTICLES
IF
THE
HOST
IS
A
SIGN
OF
GRACE
THIS
ISNT
AND
ISSUE
BUT
CATHOLICS
IN
THE
PAST
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DISTRAUGHT
AT
THIS
REAL
DESACRATION
OF
THE
REAL
SYMBOL
OF
JESUS
BODY
MODERN
CATHOLIC
LITURGY
IS
CAUGHT
IN
THIS
EPISTEMOLOGICAL
SHIFT
WE
TRY
TO
PERFROM
THE
OLD
RITES
BUT
THEN
WE
HAVE
SOME
LITURGOMANIAC
PRIEST
GET
UP
AND
EXPLAIN
WHAT
WE
ARE
DOING
SO
WE
STOP
DOING
IT
AND
START
PRETENDING
TO
DO
IT
THIS
IS
NOT
A
SOUL
FILLING
EXPERIENCE
IT
DOESNT
HELP
BTW
THAT
WE
HAVE
GOT
STUCK
WITHA
HUGE
AMOUNT
OF
TWO
AND
THREE
CHORD
ERSATZFOLK
MUSIC
AGAIN
A
RESULT
OF
MISANALYSIS
COMPLICATED
TUNES
ARE
IN
FACT
EASIER
TO
REMEMBER
THAN
SIMPLE
ONES
THIS
WAS
THE
GENIUS
OF
WESLEY
AND
THE
ANGLICAN
HYMN
WRITERS
TAIZE
IS
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
BETTER
WHAT
ARE
WE
TO
DO
WELL
I
SUGGEST
REJECTING
THE
PARISH
SYSTEM
IF
IT
DOESNT
WORK
FOR
YOU
SEARCH
OUT
A
CHURCH
WHERE
THE
LITURGY
IS
WELL
PREPARED
NOT
WELLEXPLAINED
THEY
EXIST
IN
EVERY
CITY
THIS
IS
NOT
BTW
A
MATTER
OF
PARTICULAR
STYLE
THE
MUSIC
MIGHT
BE
OLD
OR
NEW
IT
IS
THE
ATTITUDE
OF
THE
CHURCH
THAT
COUNTS
ALSO
NOTE
THAT
A
CONSERVATIVE
LITURGY
HARKING
BACK
TO
PREVATICAN
II
DAYS
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
THE
CHURCH
WILL
BE
SOCIALLY
CONSERVATIVE
IN
NYC
I
CAN
RECOMMEND
