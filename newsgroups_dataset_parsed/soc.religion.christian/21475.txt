RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
JOSEPH
H
BUEHLER
WRITES
THIS
ALL
OBVIOUSLY
APPLIES
EQUALLY
WELL
TO
INFANTS
OR
ADULTS
SINCE
BOTH
HAVE
SOULS
INFANTS
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
THEREFORE
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
THEY
TOO
NEED
THIS
FORM
OF
LIFE
IN
THEM
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
BAPTISM
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
ASKING
JESUS
TO
COME
INTO
YOUR
HEART
AND
ACCEPTING
HIM
AS
YOUR
SAVIOR
BUT
IS
JUST
A
RITUAL
THAT
WE
MUST
GO
THROUGH
TO
ENABLE
US
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
