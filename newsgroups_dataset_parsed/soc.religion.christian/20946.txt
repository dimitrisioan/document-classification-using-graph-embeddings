RE
CERTAINTY
AND
ARROGANCE
IN
ARTICLE
KILROYGBOROROWANEDU
DR
NANCYS
SWEETIE
WRITES
SOMEONE
CALLED
REXLEX
HAS
CLAIMED
THAT
THERE
IS
A
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
BOTHER
TO
EXPLAIN
WHAT
IT
WAS
PREFERRING
INSTEAD
TO
PARAPHRASE
SARTRE
RAMBLE
ABOUT
WITTGENSTEIN
AND
SAY
THAT
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
MY
ARGUMENT
LEADS
TO
RELATIVISM
I
WILL
ANSWER
THIS
AS
I
FIND
TIME
REXLEX
SUGGESTED
THAT
PEOPLE
READ
HE
IS
THERE
AND
HE
IS
NOT
SILENT
BY
FRANCIS
SCHAEFFER
I
DIDNT
THINK
VERY
HIGHLY
OF
IT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
MR
SCHAEFFER
IS
GROSSLY
OVERRATED
BY
MANY
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS
SOMEBODY
ELSE
MIGHT
LIKE
IT
THOUGH
SO
DONT
LET
MY
OPINION
STOP
YOU
FROM
READING
IT
IF
SOMEONE
IS
INTERESTED
IN
MY
OPINION
ID
SUGGEST
ON
CERTAINTY
BY
LUDWIG
WITTGENSTEIN
DARREN
F
PROVINE
KILROYGBOROROWANEDU
IF
ANY
SUBSTANTIAL
NUMBER
OF
TALKRELIGIONMISC
READERS
READ
SOME
WITTGENSTEIN
OF
THE
POSTINGS
WOULD
DISAPPEAR
IF
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
SOME
WITTGENSTEIN
WOULD
DISAPPEAR
MICHAEL
L
SIEMON
NOTICE
WHAT
I
SAID
ABOUT
THIS
BOOK
I
CALLED
IT
EASY
READING
THE
REASON
I
DROPPED
PHILOSPHY
AS
MY
MAJOR
WAS
BECAUSE
I
RAN
INTO
TOO
MANY
PHARISAICAL
SIMONS
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
MANY
WALKING
ENCYCLOPEDIAS
I
RAN
ACROSS
IN
PHILOSPHY
CLASSES
THE
PROBLEM
ISNT
IN
KNOWING
SOOOOO
MUCH
MORE
THAN
YOUR
AVERAGE
LAY
PERSON
THE
PROBLEM
COMES
WHEN
YOU
BECOME
PUFFED
UP
ABOUT
IT
SCHAEFFER
IS
JUST
FINE
FOR
THE
AVERAGE
LAY
PERSON
THAT
WAS
WHO
HE
WAS
WRITTING
TO
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
CRITICISED
JOHN
THAT
HIS
GOSPEL
WAS
TO
SIMPLE
IVE
TALKED
WITH
SCHAEFFER
ONE
ON
ONE
IVE
BEEN
IN
LECTURES
WITH
THE
MAN
WHEN
HE
WAS
BEING
DRILLED
BY
PHILOSPHY
STUDENTS
AND
PROFS
FROM
SECULAR
AS
WELL
AS
CHRISTIAN
UNIVERSITIES
ND
ALONE
WOULD
FILL
BOTH
THOSE
CATAGORIES
HIS
ANSWERS
WERE
ENOUGH
THAT
THE
PROFS
THEMSELVES
OFTEN
WERE
TAKEN
BACK
AND
CAUSED
TO
RETHINK
WHAT
THEIR
QUESTION
WAS
I
SAW
THIS
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
AT
DIFFERENT
OPEN
FORUMS
SO
YES
SCHAEFFERS
BOOKS
ARE
BY
IN
LARGE
WELL
SIMPLISTIC
IT
CERTAINLY
ISNT
GRAD
LEVEL
READING
BUT
WE
MUST
GET
OFF
OUR
HIGH
HORSES
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
RECOMMENDED
READING
DO
YOU
SERIOUSLY
THINK
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
GET
THROUGH
THE
FIRST
CHAPTER
OF
WITTGENSTEIN
I
MAY
HAVE
MORE
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THIS
SECULAR
SCIENTIST
AT
ANOTHER
TIME
ALSO
ONE
MUST
FINALLY
GET
BEYOND
THE
DOUBT
CAUSED
BY
INSISTENT
INQUISITIVENESS
ONE
CANNOT
LIVE
HIS
LIFE
CONSTANTLY
FROM
A
CARTISIAN
DOUBT
BASE
LOOK
THE
CHRISTIAN
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
SUPPORTS
GENUINE
RATIONALITY
BUT
WE
MUST
ADD
A
QUALIFICATION
TO
GIVE
THIS
BALANCE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
SECOND
TO
NONE
IN
KEEPING
REASON
IN
ITS
PLACE
WE
NEVER
KNOW
THE
VALUE
OF
A
THING
UNTIL
WE
KNOW
ITS
LIMITS
PUT
UNLIMITED
VALUE
ON
SOMETHING
AND
IN
THE
END
YOU
WILL
EXHAUST
IT
OF
ALL
VALUE
THIS
IS
WHY
XIANITY
IS
THOROUGHLY
RATIONAL
BUT
NOT
THE
LEAST
BIT
RATIONALISTIC
IT
ALSO
EXPLAINS
THE
CURIOUS
FACT
THAT
IT
IS
RATIONALISM
AND
NOT
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
WHICH
LEADS
TO
IRRATIONALITY
IF
WE
FORGET
THE
LIMITS
OF
A
THING
WE
FLY
IN
THE
FACE
OF
REALITY
AND
CONDEM
OURSELVES
TO
LEARN
THE
SIMPLE
IRONIC
LESSON
OF
LIFE
MORE
WITHOUT
LIMITS
IS
LESS
LESS
WITH
LIMITS
IS
MORE
OR
AS
I
HAVE
SO
OFTEN
STATED
IT
FREEDOM
WITHOUT
FORM
SOON
BECOMES
FORM
WO
FREEDOM
LETS
PUT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
THE
RATIONALITY
OF
FAITH
IS
IMPLACABLY
OPPOSED
TO
ABSURDITY
BUT
HAS
NO
QUARREL
WITH
MYSTERY
THINK
ABOUT
THAT
IT
CAN
TELL
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
IF
YOU
WILL
LET
IT
CHRISTIANITYS
CONTENTION
WITH
RATIONALISM
IS
NOT
THAT
IT
HAS
TOO
MUCH
REASON
IN
IT
BUT
THAT
IT
HAS
VERY
LITTLE
ELSE
WHEN
A
CHRISTIAN
COMES
TO
FAITH
HIS
UNDERSTANDING
AND
HIS
TRUST
GO
HAND
IN
HAND
BUT
AS
HE
CONTINUES
IN
FAITH
HIS
TRUST
MAY
SOMETIMES
BE
CALLED
TO
GO
ON
BY
ITSELF
WITHOUT
HIS
UNDERSTANDING
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
SUSPENDED
JUDGMENT
APPLIES
AT
SUCH
TIME
IF
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
IS
TO
BE
ITSELF
AND
LET
GOD
BE
GOD
IT
MUST
SUSPEND
JUDGMENT
AND
SAY
FATHER
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
YOU
BUT
I
TRUST
YOU
NOW
DONT
READ
ALL
YOUR
OBJECTIONS
OF
ME
INTO
THAT
STATEMENT
I
WASNT
SAYING
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
YOU
AT
ALL
BUT
I
TRUST
YOU
ANYWAY
IT
MEANS
THAT
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
YOU
IN
THIS
SITUATION
BUT
I
DO
UNDERSTAND
WHY
I
TRUST
YOU
ANYWAY
THEREFORE
I
CAN
TRUST
THAT
YOU
UNDERSTAND
EVEN
THOUGH
I
DO
NOT
THE
FORMER
IS
A
MYSTERY
UNRELIEVED
BY
RATIONALITY
AND
INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM
ABSURDITY
THE
LATTER
IS
A
STATEMENT
OF
RATIONALITY
OF
FAITH
WALKING
HAND
IN
HAND
WITH
THE
MYSTERY
OF
FAITH
SO
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
SUSPENDED
JUDGMENT
IS
NOT
IRRATIONAL
IT
IS
NOT
A
LEAP
OF
FAITH
BUT
A
WALK
OF
FAITH
AS
BELIEVERS
WE
CANNOT
ALWAYS
KNOW
WHY
BUT
WE
CANALWAYS
KNOW
WHY
WE
TRUST
GOD
WHO
KNOWS
WHY
AND
THIS
MAKES
ALL
THE
DIFFERENCE
NOW
THERE
IS
ONE
OBVIOUS
SNAG
TO
ALL
THIS
AND
THIS
IS
WHERE
I
HAVE
PARTED
COMPANY
WITH
PHILOSOPHY
WHAT
IS
EMINENTLY
REASONABLE
IN
THEORY
IS
A
RATHER
BIT
MORE
DIFFICULT
IN
PRACTICE
IN
PRACTICE
THE
PRESSURE
OF
MYSTERY
ACTS
ON
FAITH
LIKE
THE
INSISTENT
WHYING
OF
A
YEAR
OLD
IT
ISNT
JUST
THAT
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHAT
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
BUT
THAT
WE
FEEL
WE
MUST
KNOW
WHAT
WE
CANNOT
KNOW
THE
ONE
PRODUCES
FRUSTRATION
BECAUSE
CURIOSITY
IS
DENIED
THE
OTHER
LEADS
TO
GENUINE
ANGUISH
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
THE
POORER
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
IS
IN
COMING
TO
FAITH
THE
MORE
NECESSARY
IT
WILL
BE
TO
UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING
AFTER
COMING
TO
FAITH
IF
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHY
WE
TRUST
GOD
THEN
WE
WILL
ALWAYS
NEED
TO
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
GOD
IS
DOING
IN
ORDER
TO
TRUST
HIM
FAILING
TO
GRASP
THAT
WE
MAY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
TRUST
HIM
FOR
ANYTHING
WE
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
MAY
COUNT
DECISEVELY
AGAINST
WHAT
WE
ARE
ABLE
TO
TRUST
IF
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WE
DO
KNOW
WHY
WE
TRUST
GOD
WE
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
TRUST
HIM
IN
SITUATIONS
WHERE
WE
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
HE
IS
DOING
TOO
MANY
XIAN
LEADERS
TEACH
AS
IF
THE
CHRISTIAN
HAD
A
WINDOW
IN
THE
BACK
OF
HIS
HEAD
WHICH
ALLOWS
FOR
UNDERSTANDING
AT
EVERY
FOOT
FALL
FOR
WHAT
GOD
IS
DOING
MAY
BE
AMBIGUOUS
BUT
IT
WILL
NOT
BE
INHERENTLY
CONTRADICTORY
IT
MAY
BE
MYSTERY
TO
US
BUT
MYSTERY
IS
ONLY
INSCRUTABLE
WHAT
WOULD
BE
INSUFFERABLE
IS
ABSURDITY
AND
THAT
MY
FRIEND
WAS
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
NIETZCHE
BOTH
IN
THEORY
AND
IN
PRACTICE
