WRITES
TO
ALL
DC
ALSO
WHAT
IS
ORTHODOX
PRACTICE
REGARDING

I
READ
DC
A
THROWAWAY
REMARK
SOMEPLACE
THAT
THE
ORTHODOX
RECEIVE
LESS

FREQUENTLY
THAN

DO
BUT
WAS
IS
THEIR
CURRENT
PRACTICE
DC
HAVE
THEIR
BEEN
ANY
VARIATIONS
HISTORICALLY
I
THINK
ORTHODOX
PRACTICE
VARIES
FROM
PLACE

PLACE
FROM
PARISH
TO
PARISH
AND
FROM
JURISDICTION
TO
JURISDICTION
IN
SOME
PARISHES
HERE
IN
SOUTH
AFRICA
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
RECEIVE
COMMUNION
ARE
INFANTS
IE
CHILDREN
UNDER
IN
OUR
PARISH
IT
IS
EXPECTED
THAT
ONE
WILL
HAVE
BEEN
TO
VESPERS
AND
CONFESSIONAL
PRAYERS
THE
EVENING
BEFORE
AND
THAT
ONE
WILL
HAVE
BEEN
FASTING
AS
WE
HAVE
TO
TRAVEL
TO
THE

WE
DON
T
RECEIVE
COMMUNION
