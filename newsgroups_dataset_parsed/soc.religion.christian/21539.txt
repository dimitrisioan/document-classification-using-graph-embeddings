DAVID
E
GOGGIN
WRITES
ID
LIKE
TO
GET
YOUR
COMMENTS
ON
A
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
BEEN
ON
MY
MIND
A
LOT
WHAT
MORALSETHICS
APPLY
TO
DREAMS
AND
OUTOFBODY
INCIDENTS
IN
NORMAL
DREAMS
YOU
CANT
CONTROL
ANYTHING
SO
OBVIOUSLY
YOU
ARENT
MORALLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
YOUR
ACTIONS
BUT
IF
YOU
CAN
CONTRIVE
TO
CONTROL
THE
ACTION
IN
DREAMS
OR
DO
AN
OOBE
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
A
MORALITY
APPLIES
I
THINK
THAT
IF
SOMEONE
OFTEN
HAS
IMMORAL
DREAMS
LIKE
LUSTFUL
DREAMS
OR
DREAMS
WHERE
YOU
COMMIT
ACTS
OF
VIOLENCE
ETC
ETC
IT
MAY
BE
A
SIGN
THAT
HE
HAS
SOMETHING
SINFUL
IN
HIS
HEART
IT
MAY
BE
THE
HOLY
SPIRITS
WAY
OF
ALLOWING
THE
SINFULNESS
THAT
IS
IN
US
TO
COME
TO
LIGHT
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
PRAY
ABOUT
IT
AND
HAVE
IT
REMOVED
GENERALLY
IF
ONE
HAS
A
PURE
HEART
AND
SETS
HIS
MIND
ON
THINGS
THAT
ARE
HOLY
HE
WILL
BE
HOLY
EVEN
WHEN
HE
DREAMS
DREAMS
ALSO
CAN
BE
FROM
THE
LORD
JOSEPH
AND
NEBUCADNEZZAR
ARE
TWO
EXAMPLES
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHO
RECEIVED
DREAMS
FROM
THE
LORD
REGARDING
OUT
OF
BODY
EXPERIENCES
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
WE
HAVE
TO
BE
CAREFUL
WITH
WHAT
IS
CALLED
AN
OOBE
CAN
BE
SPIRITUAL
IN
NATURE
ESPECIALLY
IF
WHAT
ONE
SAW
IS
THE
SAME
AS
AN
EXPERIENCE
WITNESSED
BY
SOMEONE
ELSE
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
CERTAINLY
AVOID
ANY
OCCULT
ACTIVITY
THAT
WOULD
GENERATE
AN
OUT
OF
BODY
EXPERIENCE
SOME
THINGS
THAT
MIGHT
BE
CALLED
AN
OOBE
MIGHT
ACTUALLY
BE
FROM
THE
LORD
PAUL
WROTE
OF
WHAT
MIGHT
OF
BEEN
AN
OOBE
IN
II
CORINTHIANS
HE
WROTE
OF
A
SPIRITUAL
EXPERIENCE
OF
BEING
CAUGHT
UP
INTO
THE
THIRD
HEAVEN
IS
AN
OOBE
TRUELY
AN
OOBE
DOES
ONE
REALLY
LEAVE
HIS
BODY
OR
IS
HE
JUST
SEEING
AN
IMAGE
BEING
SHOWN
TO
HIM
BY
A
SPIRIT
BE
IT
A
DEMON
OR
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
I
DONT
THINK
IT
MATTERS
THAT
MUCH
PAUL
COULD
NOT
TELL
BE
THAT
AS
IT
MAY
WE
SHOULD
BE
CAREFUL
NOT
TO
OPEN
OURSELVES
UP
TO
SATAN
TO
EXPERIENCE
OOBES
WE
SHOULD
NOT
MEDITATE
AND
PRETEND
WE
ARE
IN
A
PLACE
UNTIL
OUR
SPIRITS
APPARENTLY
FLOAT
THERE
THIS
IS
DANGEROUS
IF
GOD
WANTS
TO
GICE
US
WHAT
SEEMS
LIKE
AN
OOBE
THEN
HE
CAN
DO
THAT
OF
HIS
OWN
SOVEREIGN
WILL
IN
THE
BIBLE
MOST
OFTEN
IT
SEEMS
THAT
PROPHETS
ARE
JUST
TAKEN
UP
BY
GODS
SOVEREIGN
WILL
AND
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
SEEKING
AN
OOBE
JOHN
WAS
IN
THE
SPIRIT
PRAYING
ON
THE
LORDS
DAY
WHEN
HE
WAS
CAUGHT
UP
IN
THE
VISIONS
HE
RECEIVED
EZEKIAL
WAS
TALKING
WITH
SOME
JEWISH
LEADERS
WHEN
HE
WAS
CAUGHT
UP
INTO
THE
VISIONS
OF
GOD
ONE
TIME
IF
GOD
WANTS
TO
TAKE
ONE
OF
US
UP
INTO
A
VISION
HE
CAN
DO
IT
PEOPLE
SHOULD
BE
CAREFUL
NOT
TO
OPEN
THEMSELVES
UP
TO
EVIL
SPIRITS
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
A
FEW
THRILLS
