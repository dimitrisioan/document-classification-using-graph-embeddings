we
can
also
analyze
to
whom
the
lord
is
addressing
marvel
alan
not
that
i
said
unto
thee
ye
must
be
born
again
john
alan
here
jesus
is
clearly
directing
his
remarks
to
nicodemus
a
alan
ruler
of
the
jews
not
a
child
yes
but
jesus
also
made
a
very
general
and
doctrinal
statement
in
the
same
conversation
flesh
gives
birth
to
flesh
but
the
spirit
gives
birth
to
spirit
john
clearly
infants
are
not
born
of
the
spirit
thus
without
baptism
they
are
unspiritual
they
are
not
born
with
the
image
of
god
but
in
adams
fallen
image
cf
gen
they
have
no
righteousness
of
their
own
just
as
adults
have
no
righteousness
of
their
own
there
is
only
the
imputed
righteousness
of
christ
which
believers
receive
through
faith
alan
we
can
ask
ourselves
why
the
lord
would
even
introduce
the
alan
concept
of
spiritual
rebirth
through
baptism
if
newborn
babies
alan
werent
free
from
sin
your
point
is
a
little
obscure
here
but
i
think
you
are
saying
that
christ
used
the
innocence
of
newborn
babes
as
a
metaphor
for
spiritual
rebirth
but
this
is
not
what
he
did
if
you
look
at
the
text
he
did
not
speak
of
spiritual
rebirth
but
of
spiritual
birth
we
are
born
of
the
spirit
once
not
twice
or
several
times
we
are
also
born
of
the
flesh
once
the
lord
makes
it
clear
that
these
are
separate
and
different
events
it
is
true
that
other
scriptures
refer
to
spiritual
birth
as
rebirth
because
it
is
a
second
birth
for
example
titus
but
it
is
not
a
second
spiritual
birth
the
only
thing
the
two
births
have
in
common
is
the
concept
of
birth
which
is
used
as
a
symbol
of
new
life
not
of
innocence
when
an
infant
is
born
or
conceived
a
new
life
is
begunbut
it
is
neither
innocent
nor
righteous
similarly
when
that
same
individual
is
baptized
or
perhaps
when
they
believe
prior
to
baptism
they
begin
a
new
life
in
christ
romans
colossians
titus
ephesians
then
the
believer
has
gods
assurance
of
the
forgiveness
of
their
sins
and
of
christs
imputed
righteousness
