i
am
not
against
capital
punishment
i
feel
this
way
because
god
is
not
only
a
god
of
love
but
a
god
of
justice
as
we
christians
are
the
instruments
of
his
will
here
on
earth
we
are
expected
to
be
true
to
the
mandate
given
us
by
the
lord
to
judge
the
actions
of
our
fellow
man
my
favorite
scriptural
reference
in
this
regard
is
romans
let
every
person
be
subordinate
to
the
higher
authorities
for
there
is
no
authority
except
from
god
and
those
that
exist
have
been
established
by
god
therefore
whoever
resists
authority
opposes
what
god
has
appointed
and
those
who
oppose
it
will
bring
judgment
upon
themselves
my
views
reflect
the
teaching
of
the
roman
catholic
church
i
would
say
only
to
the
extent
that
the
roman
catholic
church
neither
approves
nor
disapproves
of
capital
punishment
as
confirmed
in
the
recent
catechism
though
there
are
many
rcs
who
were
rather
surprised
and
upset
that
capital
punishment
was
not
explicitly
condemned
for
myself
as
a
catholic
i
see
my
own
opposition
to
capital
punishment
as
much
the
same
as
my
opposition
to
abortion
a
reverence
for
life
here
in
the
uk
the
antiabortion
case
is
often
let
down
by
the
explicit
link
which
those
on
the
political
left
make
with
antiabortionists
and
proexecutionists
there
is
a
tendency
to
condemn
people
who
hold
both
views
as
hypocrites
i
feel
that
if
there
were
many
more
antiabortionists
who
were
also
vocal
in
their
opposition
to
capital
punishment
on
a
prolife
line
it
would
end
this
kneejerk
association
of
antiabortion
as
a
rightwing
thing
and
get
many
to
think
seriously
about
the
issue
there
are
plenty
who
are
proabortion
equally
for
a
kneejerk
leftwing
reason
i
do
not
think
your
biblical
quote
can
automatically
be
taken
as
support
for
capital
punishment
i
take
it
that
as
a
roman
catholic
you
are
opposed
to
abortion
and
would
still
onsider
it
wrong
and
something
to
be
objected
to
even
if
legalised

authority
