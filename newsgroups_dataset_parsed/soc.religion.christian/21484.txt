any

are

should

out

to
name
a
few
of
the
verses
that
pertain
to
homosexuality
in
christs
love

whitsell
like
we
have
never
heard
of
or
read
these
verses
before
how
about
you
read
them
in
context
taking
into
consideration
the
times
and
places
in
which
they
were
written
the
local
customs
and
pagan
rituals
what
the
surrounding
verses
are
talking
about
and
how
they
interact
with
the
rest
of
the
bible
there
are
many
issues
in
the
bible
that
are
argued
and
can
be
argued
successfullly
from
both
sides
of
an
issue
some
examples
that
come
to
mind
are
gifts
of
the
spirit
when
the
rapture
will
occurpre
or
post
tribulation
how
people
should
be
baptized
to
name
a
few
i
have
found
nothing
in
scripture
that
condemns
me
or
anyone
else
for
having
a
monogamous
relationship
with
the
person
whom
i
love
even
if
we
are
the
same
sex
im
sorry
if
i
am
coming
across
as
heated
its
just
that
the
lord
has
been
so
dear
to
me
the
last
several
years
and
im
tired
of
hearing
this
same
old
thing
from
people
who
believe
what
their
told
rather
than
finding
out
for
themselves
check
it
out
for
yourself
invite
the
holy
spirit
to
guide
you
if
i
werent
confident
of
this
i
wouldnt
invite
you
to
do
this
god
bless
