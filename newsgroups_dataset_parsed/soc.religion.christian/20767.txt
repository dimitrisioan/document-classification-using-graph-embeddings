LAWRENCE
C
FOARD
WRITES
AND
MANY
OTHERS
MAILED
ME
HERE
IS
A
REPLY
TO
ONE
OF
THE
LETTERS
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
ATHEIST
DO
NOT
LIKE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
HELL
THERES
NOTHING
LIKE
A
PREACHER
TO
PUT
FEAR
INTO
AN
IGNORANT
MAN
IF
GOD
HADNT
CREATED
HELL
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THERED
BE
NO
NO
NEED
TO
DIE
AND
SAVE
US
ISNT
IT
ALSO
A
BIT
PARADOXICAL
TO
SAY
GOD
DIED
WHEN
IN
FACT
NO
SUCH
THING
IS
REMOTELY
POSSIBLE
CAN
THE
INFINITE
DIE
YOUR
USING
CENTURY
CONCEPTS
TO
INTERPRETE
CENTURY
WRITERS
OF
COURSE
IN
YOUR
TERMONOLOGY
GOD
COULD
NOT
CEASE
TO
EXIST
HOWEVER
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
DEATH
EVER
MEANS
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
IF
YOU
WILL
STUDY
THE
WORD
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
IT
SIGNIFIES
SEPARATION
DEATH
IS
SEPARATION
NOT
CEASTATION
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
AGONY
OF
THE
CROSS
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
ETERNITY
ONE
MEMBER
OF
THE
GODHEAD
WAS
SEPARATED
FROM
THE
OTHER
TWO
I
ONCE
MET
A
YOUNG
LADY
THAT
WAS
AS
BEAUTIFUL
AS
ANY
MODEL
THAT
EVER
LIVED
SHE
WAS
AS
PERSONABLE
AS
ANY
SAINT
EVER
IMAGINED
SHE
WAS
TO
BECOME
MY
GIRLFRIEND
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
HOWEVER
HAVING
BEEN
DRAFTED
WE
WERE
SEPARATED
BY
DISTANCE
TO
ME
THAT
WAS
A
FORM
OF
DEATH
LATER
SHE
DECIDED
THAT
SHE
COULDNT
WAIT
FOR
ME
TO
COME
HOME
AND
BID
ME
ADUE
THAT
TO
ME
WAS
DEATH
IT
WAS
SEPARATION
FROM
THAT
WHICH
HAD
MADE
ME
WHOLE
DEATH
IS
SEPARATION
AND
ETERNAL
DEATH
IS
ETERNAL
SEPARATION
FROM
HIS
FELLOWSHIP
NOT
BECAUSE
HE
CHOSE
TO
SEND
YOU
INTO
OUTER
DARKNESS
BUT
BECAUSE
YOU
CHOSE
TO
GO
THERE
DID
YOU
KNOW
THAT
JESUS
TALKED
MORE
ABOUT
HELL
THAN
HE
DID
ABOUT
HEAVEN
THANK
YOU
FOR
THIS
INFO
WHAT
RESPECT
I
HAD
FOR
THE
MAN
NOW
HAS
BEEN
DIMINISHED
TENFOLD
I
PROMISE
NEVER
AGAIN
TO
SAY
HOW
WISE
OR
LOVING
THIS
MAN
WAS
WHEN
I
REBELLED
AGAINST
MY
EARTHLY
FATHER
HE
SPANKED
ME
I
FOUND
NO
WISDOM
IN
THAT
UNTIL
I
HAD
GROWN
OLDER
AND
ESPECIALLY
UNTIL
I
HAD
MY
OWN
CHILDREN
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
GUIDE
ME
AWAY
FROM
HURT
THAT
WOULD
ENTER
MY
LIFE
IF
I
CONTINUED
ON
MY
SUICIDAL
COURSE
HE
DID
IT
IN
LOVE
THOUGH
I
INTERPRETED
IT
AS
HARSH
AND
UNLOVING
IF
GOD
WARNS
OF
IMPENDING
DANGER
THAT
IS
LOVE
IF
CHOOSE
TO
LET
US
DO
AS
WE
PLEASE
AND
THEN
AT
THE
END
TELL
US
THE
RULES
THAT
WOULD
BE
HARSH
YOU
HAVE
A
CONSCIENCE
NO
MATTER
HOW
CALUSED
OR
FALLEN
IT
IS
THAT
WITNESSES
TO
YOU
THAT
A
THING
IS
WRONG
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
CAUSE
FOR
FEAR
BEING
JESUS
WAS
ALLEGEDLY
GOD
I
DOUBT
HE
COULD
HONESTLY
FEEL
THE
PINPRICKS
MAN
DEALT
HIM
THIS
MAY
GIVE
LIGHT
TO
THE
ERROR
OF
YOUR
UNDERSTANDING
ONE
MUST
HAVE
CORRECT
KNOWLEDGE
IN
ORDER
TO
HAVE
CORRECT
FAITH
FAITH
AND
KNOWLEDGE
ARE
INSEPARABLE
JESUS
MOST
CERTAINLY
FELT
THE
PINPRICKS
OF
LIFE
AS
THE
SCRIPTURE
SAY
HEB
FOR
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
HIGH
PRIEST
WHO
CANNOT
SYMPATHIZE
WITH
OUR
WEAKNESSES
BUT
ONE
WHO
HAS
BEEN
TEMPTED
IN
ALL
THINGS
AS
WE
ARE
YET
WITHOUT
SIN
THE
KENOSIS
PASSAGE
OF
PHIL
STATES
THAT
HE
GAVE
UP
HIS
GODHEAD
ATTRIBUTES
WHEN
HE
TOOK
UPON
HIMSELF
HUMANITY
IT
HAS
BEEN
A
FAVORITE
MEDITATION
OF
MINE
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THIS
IT
WAS
TO
BE
MY
PHD
THESIS
THE
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
CHRIST
I
HAVE
TALKED
AT
LENGTH
WITH
A
GREAT
MANY
PEOPLE
ABOUT
THIS
INTERESTING
STUDY
INCLUDING
CLH
IT
IS
MY
CONCLUSSION
THAT
AS
JESUS
THE
MEMBER
OF
THE
TRINITY
ACTUALLY
SUFFERED
AS
WE
DO
HE
BECAME
PART
OF
THE
HUMAN
RACE
AND
EXPERIENCED
IT
AS
WE
DO
HE
GREW
IN
KNOWLEDGE
HE
CHOSE
NOT
TO
GRASP
HIS
OMNISCIENCE
BUT
CHOSE
TO
BE
TAUGHT
IT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
HE
WAS
LED
OF
THE
SPIRIT
TO
SUCH
AN
EXTENT
THAT
SOMETIMES
IT
IS
HARD
TO
DISTINQUISH
BETWEEN
JESUS
THE
MAN
AND
JESUS
AS
GOD
BUT
IN
JN
WHERE
THE
ADULTEROUS
WOMEN
WAS
THROWN
BEFORE
HIM
THE
TENSES
ARE
QUITE
CLEAR
IN
THAT
THE
WHOLE
SITUATION
TOOK
HIM
BY
SURPRISE
THAT
IS
HE
WAS
NOT
AWARE
THAT
THIS
EVENT
WAS
TO
TAKE
PLACE
IN
TIME
HE
WAS
LIVING
SEQUENTIAL
HISTORY
AS
YOU
OR
I
MAYBE
SOME
OTHER
TIME
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
THIS
BUT
IT
IS
A
VERY
LENGTHY
DISCUSSION
AND
ONE
THAT
CAUSES
THE
CURCUIT
BREAKERS
OF
THE
BRAIN
TO
POP
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
NOT
THANKS
AGAIN
FOR
THE
INFO
JUST
SO
YOU
KNOW
SOME
FRIENDS
AND
I
ARE
STARTING
A
FREETHINKERS
ORGANIZATION
AND
IM
GOING
TO
USE
SOME
OF
THE
INFO
YOU
PROVIDED
FOR
AN
ORGANIZATION
INTRO
DUCTION
I
WAS
ONCE
A
MEMBER
OF
THAT
CLUB
THE
FREE
THINKER
IS
A
GLORIOUS
IDEAL
BY
CONTRAST
OF
COURSE
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BELIEVER
IS
THE
UNFORUNATE
REPOSITORY
OF
EVERYTHING
THAT
IS
DOGMATIC
INHIBITED
REACTIONARY
AND
REPRESSIVE
I
FIND
SUCH
A
STANCE
TO
BE
AS
AMUSING
AS
IT
IS
ABSURD
IF
THE
LIBERAL
HUMANIST
WISHES
TO
CRITICIZE
A
CHRISTIAN
OR
A
BUDDHIST
OR
A
MARXIST
THAT
IS
HIS
RIGHT
BUT
WHAT
HE
MUST
NOT
PRETEND
IS
THAT
HE
WAS
LED
TO
THIS
SOLELY
BY
HIS
RATIONAL
DOUBT
WHEN
IN
FACT
HE
WAS
LED
TO
IT
BY
HIS
FAITH
HE
MUST
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
WHILE
IT
IS
RATIONAL
DOUBT
FOR
HIM
AS
A
FREE
THINKER
TO
CRITICIZE
THE
CHRISTIAN
IT
MIGHT
EQUALLY
BE
A
RATIONAL
DOUBT
FOR
THE
CHRISTIAN
TO
CRITICIZE
HIM
AS
A
HUMANIST
IF
THERE
IS
NO
FAITH
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
DOUT
THERE
IS
NO
FAITH
WHICH
CANNOT
CHOOSE
TO
CAST
DOUBT
ON
SOME
OTHER
FAITH
PASCAL
POINTED
OUT
THAT
SCEPTICAL
ARGUMENTS
ALLOW
THE
POSITIVE
TO
BE
POSITIVE
FEW
SPEAK
DUBIOUSLY
OF
SCEPTICISM
THE
FACT
THAT
SKEPTICS
ARE
NOT
SKEPTICAL
ABOUT
SKEPTICISM
IS
FURTHER
EVIDENCE
THAT
TO
DOUBT
ANYTHING
WE
MUST
BELIEVE
IN
SOMETHING
ELSE
THE
PERSON
WHO
IS
SKEPTICAL
TOWARD
ONE
FAITH
OR
EVEN
MOST
FAITHS
WILL
BE
THE
DEVOTED
ADHERENT
OF
ANOTHER
IN
FACT
IT
IS
A
MEASURE
OF
HIS
POVERTY
BOTH
THAT
HE
IS
UNAWARE
OF
IT
AND
THAT
HE
CAN
DEFINE
HIMSELF
ONLY
IN
NEGATIVE
TERMS
HENCE
THE
TERM
ATHEIST
SOME
PEOPLE
CLAIM
OTHERWISE
AND
ARGUE
VOCIFEROUSLY
FOR
COMPLETE
SKEPTICISM
IN
MY
CAMPUS
MINISTRY
I
RAN
ACROSS
THIS
MORE
TIMES
THAN
I
CARE
TO
REMEMBER
HOWEVER
THEY
DISPROVED
THEIR
OWN
ARGUMENT
WITH
EVERY
THOUGHT
EVERY
WORD
EVERY
POINT
OF
LOGIC
THAT
THEY
USED
EVERY
MOMENT
OF
SHARED
COMMUNICATION
SPEAKS
AGAINST
THEIR
TOTAL
SKEPTICISM
THEIR
VERY
INSISTENCE
OF
TRYING
TO
MAKE
SENSE
IS
ELOQUENT
TESTIMONY
TO
ASSUMPTIONS
THAT
ARE
POWERFUL
THOUGH
SILENT
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
COMPLETE
SKEPTICISM
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
AND
LIMITED
SKEPTICISM
IS
ARBITRARY
NEXT
TIME
YOURE
IN
A
ROOM
OF
SKEPTICS
YELL
OUT
LOOK
YOUR
FLY
IS
UNDONE
EACH
PERSON
CHOOSES
WHAT
HE
IS
SKEPTICAL
ABOUT
AND
WHAT
HE
BELIEVES
WITHOUT
SKEPTICISM
TO
STRESS
THIS
IS
TO
BELABOR
THE
OBVIOUS
BUT
IT
UNDERLINES
THE
POINT
THAT
NO
ONE
CAN
KNOW
EXHAUSTIVELY
HOW
HE
KNOWS
WHAT
HE
KNOWS
PURE
OBJECTIVISM
IS
A
MYTH
AND
COMPLETE
SKEPTICISM
AN
IMPOSSIBLITY
THE
ANSWER
TO
THIS
IMPASSE
LIES
IN
A
WAY
OF
KNOWING
ONE
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
PRESUPPOSITIONS
BUT
IF
KNOWLEDGE
PROCEEDS
ON
WHAT
MUST
BE
PRESUPPOSED
BEFORE
IT
IS
PROVED
THE
COVER
IS
BLOWN
ON
THE
PRETENTIONS
OF
CRITICAL
DOUBT
AND
CRITICAL
DOUBT
DEPENDS
ON
THE
IDEA
THAT
HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE
IS
TOTALLY
OBJECTIVE
AND
NEUTRAL
IN
OTHER
WORDS
ANOTHER
MYTH
PRESUPPOSITIONS
MY
FRIEND
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DOUBT
ANYTHING
UNLESS
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
WE
DO
NOT
DOUBT
OUR
OWN
ASSUMPTIONSPRESUPPOSTIONS
EVEN
THESE
CAN
BE
CRITICEZED
ONLY
UPON
THE
BASIS
OF
OTHER
ASSUMPTIONS
PRESUPPOSTITONS
ARE
OUR
SILENT
PARTNERS
IN
THOUGHT
BUT
THEIR
SILENCE
MUST
NOT
BE
MISTAKEN
FOR
ABSENCE
I
TELL
YOU
WHAT
IF
GOD
CONDEMNS
ME
FOR
BEING
HONEST
HE
IS
UNWORTHY
OF
MY
WORSHIP
BETTER
TO
BURN
IN
HELL
THAN
TO
SERVE
A
TYRANT
IN
HEAVEN
OF
COURSE
THAT
IS
HARDLY
AN
ORIGINAL
STATEMENT
MILTON
COINED
IT
BUT
IT
HAD
BEEN
IN
USE
FOR
MILLENIA
IT
WAS
EVEN
USED
IN
THE
FIRST
HIGHLANDER
MOVIE
BUT
AGAIN
YOUR
PRESUPTION
IS
BASED
ON
A
FAULTY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
CHARACTER
OF
GOD
YOU
ARE
OPERATING
OFF
OF
A
PRESUPPOSITIONAL
PREMISE
OF
HUMANISTIC
THEOLOGY
NOT
WHAT
HE
HAS
REVEALED
OF
HIMSELF
THROUGH
HISTORY
THROUGH
HIS
PROPHETS
THROUGH
HIS
WORD
AND
LASTLY
BUT
MOST
OF
ALL
THRU
HIS
SON
IF
YOU
ARE
TO
REJECT
GODS
ANNOINTED
SAVIOR
THEN
REJECT
HIM
FROM
A
CORRECT
UNDERSTANDING
OF
HIMSELF
