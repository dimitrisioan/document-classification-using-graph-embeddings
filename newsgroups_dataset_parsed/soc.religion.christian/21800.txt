RE
IS
THIS
ETHICAL
JUST
A
QUICK
COMMENT
AS
A
BAPTIST
CLERGYPERSON
I
FIND
THE
IDEA
OF
SUCH
A
BAPTISM
IF
THE
NEWS
REPORT
IS
IN
FACT
ACCURATE
AND
THEY
SELDOM
ARE
REGARDING
RELIGION
OFFENSIVE
THE
PASTOR
HERE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
A
MOST
UNBAPTIST
VIEW
OF
BAPTISM
ONE
THAT
SEEMS
TO
DEMAND
THE
CEREMONY
EVEN
WHEN
COMPREHENSION
AND
CHOICE
ARE
ABSENT
WE
DO
BAPTIZE
CONVERTS
BUT
NO
ONE
WHO
HAS
BEEN
DECEIVED
INTO
HEARING
THE
WORD
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
A
CONVERT
IF
IN
FACT
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
MIGHT
WORK
IN
SUCH
A
SITUATION
THERE
IS
NO
HARM
DONE
IN
WAITING
A
DAY
OR
TWO
BAPTIST
BELIEVE
IN
REGENERATE
MEMBERSHIP
DID
THIS
CHURCH
INCLUDE
THESE
HALFBAKED
AT
BEST
CONVERTS
INTO
THEIR
CHURCH
FELLOWSHIP
OR
DO
THEY
SOMEHOW
FEEL
THERE
IS
SOME
VALIDITY
IN
DUNKING
THEM
AND
TURNING
THEM
LOOSE
THIS
KIND
OF
EVANGELISM
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
BAPTIST
AND
PROBABLY
NOT
VERY
CHRISTIAN
EITHER
