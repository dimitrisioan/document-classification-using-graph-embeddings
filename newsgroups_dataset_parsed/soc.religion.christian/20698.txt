HI
EVERYONE
IM
A
COMMITED
CHRISTIAN
THAT
IS
BATTLING
WITH
A
PROBLEM
I
KNOW
THAT
ROMANS
TALKS
ABOUT
HOW
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
OUR
FAITH
NOT
OUR
DEEDS
YET
HEBREWS
AND
JAMES
SAY
THAT
FAITH
WITHOUT
DEEDS
IS
USELESS
SAYING
YOU
FOOLS
DO
YOU
STILL
THINK
THAT
JUST
BELIEVING
IS
ENOUGH
NOW
IF
SOMEONE
IS
FULLY
BELIEVING
BUT
THERE
LIFE
IS
TOTALLY
LEAD
BY
THEMSELVES
AND
NOT
BY
GOD
ACCORDING
TO
ROMANS
THAT
PERSON
IS
STILL
SAVED
BY
THERE
FAITH
BUT
THEN
THERE
IS
THE
BIT
WHICH
SAYS
THAT
GOD
PREFERES
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
COLD
TO
HIM
IE
DOESNT
KNOW
HIM
CONDEMNED
SO
A
LUKEWARM
CHRISTIAN
SOMEONE
WHO
KNOWS
AND
BELIEVES
IN
GOD
BUT
DOESNT
MAKE
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
LIVE
BY
THE
BIBLE
NOW
I
AM
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
YOU
A
SAVED
THROUGH
FAITH
ALONE
NOT
WHAT
YOU
DO
AS
TAUGHT
IN
ROMANS
BUT
HOW
CAN
I
SQUARE
UP
IN
MY
MIND
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
JAMES
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
THE
LUKEWARM
CHRISTIAN
BEING
SPATOUT
