AN
AGNOSTICS
QUESTION
PARDON
ME
IF
THIS
IS
THE
WRONG
NEWSGROUP
I
WOULD
DESCRIBE
MYSELF
AS
AN
AGNOSTIC
IN
SO
FAR
AS
IM
SURE
THERE
IS
NO
SINGLE
UNIVERSAL
SUPREME
BEING
BUT
IF
THERE
IS
ONE
AND
IT
IS
JUST
WE
WILL
SURELY
BE
JUDGED
ON
WHETHER
WE
LIVED
GOOD
LIVES
STRIVING
TO
ACHIEVE
THAT
GOODNESS
THAT
IS
WITHIN
THE
POWER
OF
EACH
OF
US
NOW
THE
COMPLICATION
IS
THAT
ONE
OF
MY
BEST
FRIENDS
HAS
BECOME
VERY
FUNDAMENTALIST
THAT
WOULD
NORMALLY
BE
A
NONISSUE
WITH
ME
BUT
HE
FEELS
IT
IS
HIS
RESPONSIBILITY
TO
PROSELYTIZE
ME
WHICH
I
GUESS
IT
IS
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
FAITH
THIS
IS
A
GREAT
STRAIN
TO
OUR
FRIENDSHIP
I
WOULD
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
IF
THE
SUBJECT
DIDNT
COME
UP
BUT
WHEN
IT
DOES
THE
DISCUSSION
QUICKLY
BEGINS
TO
OFFEND
BOTH
OF
US
HE
IS
OFFENDED
BECAUSE
I
CALL
INTO
QUESTION
HIS
BEDROCK
BELIEFS
I
AM
OFFENDED
BY
WHAT
I
FEEL
IS
A
SUBSCRIPTION
TO
SUPERSTITION
RATIONALIZED
BY
SUCH
CIRCULAR
ARGUMENTS
AS
THE
BIBLE
IS
GODS
WORD
BECAUSE
HE
TELLS
US
IN
THE
BIBLE
THAT
IT
IS
SO
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
HOW
CAN
I
CONVINCE
HIM
THAT
THIS
IS
A
SUBJECT
BETTER
LEFT
UNDISCUSSED
SO
WE
CAN
PRESERVE
WHAT
IS
IN
ALL
AREAS
OTHER
THAN
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
A
GREAT
FRIENDSHIP
HOW
DO
I
CONVINCE
HIM
THAT
I
AM
BEYOND
SAVING
SO
HE
WONT
TRY
THANKS
FOR
ANY
ADVICE
