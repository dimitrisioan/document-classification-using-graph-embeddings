asks
about
a
book
called
the
lost
years
of
jesus
by
elizabeth
clare
prophet
marriage
if
i
remember
aright
base
almost
all
their
teachings
on
messages
they
have
allegedly
received
by
telepathy
from
tibet
i
should
be
surprised
if
the
book
you
mention
has
any
scholarly
basis
actually
there
was
very
little
to
the
book
first
of
all
looking
at
the
titles
of
her
other
books
i
would
personally
consider
her
to
be
engaged
in
a
bizarre
form
of
christianlike
mysticism
heavily
influenced
by
eastern
philosphies
great
titles
like
however
other
than
the
chapter
one
into
theres
nothing
original
biased
or
even
new
this
book
it
is
basically
a
collection
of
previously
published
works
by
those
who
claim
that
there
exist
buddhist
and
hindu
stories
that
christ
visited
india
and
china
he
was
known
as
issa
during
the
period
from
late
teens
to
age
conclusion
the
book
actually
lets
you
come
to
your
own
view
by
presenting
a
summary
of
various
published
works
and
letters
all
of
which
you
could
verify
independently
it
includes
refutations
to
such
works
as
well
therefore
even
if
you
think
she
is
theologically
warped
this
book
is
a
nice
reference
summary
for
the
interested
