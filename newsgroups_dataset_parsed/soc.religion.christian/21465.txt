RE
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
TO
SUMMARIZE
WHILE
QUESTIONING
THE
SAGACITY
OF
SOMEONE
WHO
SAID
THEY
WOULD
RATHER
SPEND
AN
ETERNITY
IN
HELL
THAN
BE
BESIDE
GOD
IN
HEAVEN
KNOWING
EVEN
ONE
MAN
WOULD
SPEND
HIS
ETERNAL
LIFE
BEING
SCORCHED
FOR
HIS
WRONGDOINGS
I
DESCRIBED
HOW
HORRIBLE
HELL
IS
AND
COMPARED
THE
ABOVE
STATEMENT
WITH
JESUS
SUFFERING
ON
THE
CROSS
IN
ORDER
TO
PREVENT
PEOPLE
GOING
TO
HELL
WHICH
KENNETH
ENGEL
CHALLENGES
DID
THIS
HAPPEN
TO
JESUS
I
DONT
THINK
SO
NOT
FROM
WHAT
I
HEARD
HE
LIVED
ONE
DAY
OF
SUFFERING
AND
DIED
IF
THE
WAGES
OF
SIN
IS
THE
ABOVE
PARAGRAPH
THEN
JESUS
DIDNT
PAY
FOR
OUR
SINS
DID
HE
I
WILL
WIMP
OUT
AND
ADMIT
THAT
I
NEVER
LIKED
THE
METAPHOR
OF
JESUS
PAYING
FOR
OUR
SINS
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
MANY
CHRISTIANS
ACCEPT
AS
LITERAL
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
GOD
UNDERSTANDS
THE
SUFFERING
WE
GO
THROUGH
NOT
JUST
INTELLECTUALLY
LIKE
WHEN
WE
WATCH
THE
SOMALIANS
ON
TV
BUT
REALLY
UNDERSTANDS
HE
CAN
FEEL
OUR
PAIN
THIS
FACT
IS
MANIFESTED
BY
JESUS
LIFE
WE
CAN
ARGUE
THAT
SOMEONE
IN
HISTORY
MIGHT
HAVE
SUFFERED
MORE
THAN
JESUS
WE
CAN
THINK
OF
MORE
HORRIBLE
TORTURE
THAN
CRUCIFIXION
WE
CAN
THINK
OF
CASES
OF
BETRAYAL
AND
FRUITLESS
EFFORT
LEADING
TO
WORSE
DESPAIR
BUT
THE
MAIN
POINT
IS
THAT
JESUS
IS
IN
THE
TRENCHES
WITH
US
HE
IS
IN
EVERYONE
WHATEVER
I
DO
TO
THE
LEAST
OF
HUMANITY
I
DO
TO
HIM
AND
WHATEVER
I
DO
FOR
THE
LEAST
OF
HUMANITY
I
DO
FOR
HIM
NOW
TO
RECONCILE
THIS
WITH
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
HELL
IS
BEYOND
MY
CAPABILITIES
BUT
THAT
WASNT
MY
GOAL
ID
BE
SURPRISED
TO
SEE
THE
MODERATOR
LET
THIS
ONE
THROUGH
THANKFULLY
OUR
MODERATOR
IS
SURPRISING
BUT
I
SERIOUSLY
WANT
A
REASONABLE
EXPLANATION
FOR
THIS
AS
I
REREAD
THIS
I
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
THIS
IS
MORE
OF
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
MY
FAITH
THAN
AN
EXPLANATION
BUT
PERHAPS
THATS
ALL
I
CAN
DO
HOPEFULLY
THATS
ALL
I
HAVE
TO
DO
