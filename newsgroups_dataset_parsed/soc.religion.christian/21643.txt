homosexuality
recently
an
email
to
me
mentioned
technically
the
messengers
arent
even
human
so
it
cant
be
a
case
of
homosexuality
even
of
rape
the
jude
reference
to
sodom
is
also
meaningful
only
in
the
context
of
the
sodomites
lust
for
the
other
flesh
of
angels
again
application
to
homosexual
behavior
in
general
or
to
the
position
of
gay
christians
is
largeely
specious
are
angels
flesh
no
i
feel
that
this
is
saying
that
it
was
because
of
their
lust
after
other
men
who
are
flesh
or
of
this
world
what
are
other
opinons
on
this
i
havent
heard
much
about
this
verse
at
all
in
christs
love
