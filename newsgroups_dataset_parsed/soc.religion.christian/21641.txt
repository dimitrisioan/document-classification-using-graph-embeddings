RECONCILE
THE
IDEA
OF
ETERNAL
MARRIAGE

THAT

THE
RESSURECTION
PEOPLE
WILL
NEITHER
MARRY
NOR
BE
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE

THATS
THE
WHOLE
POINT
DAVID
AS
SPIRITS
SEPARATED
FROM
THEIR
BODIES
AND
LIVING
IN
THE
SPIRIT

THEY
CANNOT

THEY

BE
BAPTIZED
SINCE
THERE
IS

PHYSICAL

TO
BE
BAPTIZED
WE
PERFORM
THESE
ORDINANCES

THEIR
BEHALF
