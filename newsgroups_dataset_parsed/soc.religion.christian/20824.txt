RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ARTICLE
STEVE
HAYES
WRITES
SAY
FOR
EXAMPLE
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
LIVING
ON
A
VOLCANIC
ISLAND
AND
A
GROUP
OF
GEOLOGISTS
DETERMINE
THAT
A
VOLCANO
IS
IMMINENT
THEY
WARN
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
ISLAND
THAT
THEY
ARE
IN
DANGER
AND
SHOULD
LEAVE
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
ON
THE
ISLAND
IS
GIVEN
THE
TASK
OF
WARNING
OTHERS
OF
THE
DANGER
THEY
BELIEVE
THE
DANGER
IS
REAL
BUT
OTHERS
MAY
NOT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
THE
FIRST
GROUP
ARE
NECESSARILY
ARROGANT
IN
WARNING
OTHERS
OF
THE
DANGER
DOES
IT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
ARE
SAYING
THAT
THEIR
BELIEFS
ARE
CORRECT
AND
ALL
OTHERS
ARE
FALSE
BUT
WHAT
IF
THE
GEOLOGISTS
ARE
WRONG
AND
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
WARNING
OF
A
NONEXISTENT
DANGER
ANALOGIES
CAN
ONLY
PUSH
AN
ARGUMENT
SO
FAR
ON
BOTH
SIDES
BOTH
MELINDAS
AND
YOURS
ASSUME
THE
PREMISES
USED
TO
SET
UP
YOUR
RESPECTIVE
ANALOGIES
ARE
TRUE
AND
THUS
THE
CORRECT
CONCLUSION
WILL
ARISE
THE
IMPORTANT
POINT
TO
NOTE
IS
THE
DIFFERENT
DIRECTIONS
BOTH
SIDES
COME
FROM
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
THEY
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
AND
THUS
BELIEVE
THEY
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
AND
DUTY
TO
TELL
THE
TRUTH
TO
ALL
CHRISTIANS
CAN
GET
OFFENDED
IF
OTHERS
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
WHAT
IS
SELFEVIDENTLY
TO
THEM
THE
TRUTH
NONCHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
THE
TRUTH
AND
GET
OFFENDED
AT
THEM
BECAUSE
THEY
CHRISTIANS
CLAIM
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
BTW
THIS
ARGUMENT
GOES
FOR
ANYONE
I
AM
NOT
JUST
BAGGING
CHRISTIANS
NEITHER
SIDE
CAN
BE
REALLY
RECONCILED
UNLESS
ONE
OF
THE
PARTIES
CHANGES
THEIR
MIND
AS
MELINDA
POINTED
OUT
THERE
IS
NO
POINT
IN
ARGUING
ALONG
THESE
LINES
BECAUSE
BOTH
APPROACH
FROM
A
DIFFERENT
PREMISE
A
MORE
USEFUL
LINE
OF
DISCUSSION
IS
WHY
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
IN
PARTICULAR
FAITHS
PERSONALLY
I
DONT
MIND
WHAT
ANYONE
BELIEVES
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
ALLOW
ME
MINE
AND
WE
CAN
ALL
LIVE
PEACEFULLY
