RE
CHRISTIANITY
AND
REPEATED
LIVES
IN
ARTICLE
JEKCUNIHGOV
WRITES
GERRY
PALO
WRITES
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
PRECLUDES
THE
IDEA
OF
REPEATED
LIVES
ON
EARTH
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
ROMANS
POINTS
OUT
THAT
GOD
CHOSE
JACOB
RATHER
THAN
ESAU
TO
BE
THE
ANCESTOR
OF
THE
COVENANT
PEOPLE
AND
ULTIMATELY
OF
THE
MESSIAH
AND
THAT
HE
MADE
THIS
CHOICE
WHILE
THE
TWO
BOYS
WERE
STILL
IN
THEIR
MOTHERS
WOMB
AND
THEREFORE
COULD
NOT
POSSIBLY
HAVE
DONE
ANYTHING
GOOD
OR
EVIL
TO
DESERVE
THEIR
APPOINTED
DESTINIES
IF
WE
ADMIT
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THEY
HAD
LIVED
PREVIOUS
LIVES
AND
THAT
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
ASIATIC
IDEA
OF
KARMA
THEIR
PRESENT
LIVES
ARE
A
REWARD
OR
PUNISHMENT
FOR
PAST
BEHAVIOUR
THIS
MAKES
NONSENSE
OF
PAULS
WHOLE
POINT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
REPEATED
EARTH
LIVES
AND
DESTINY
KARMA
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
EVERYTHING
THAT
HAPPENS
IS
PREDETERMINED
BY
PAST
DEEDS
THERE
IS
AN
ORIENTAL
VIEW
OF
IT
THAT
TENDS
IN
THAT
DIRECTION
BUT
I
DID
NOT
SUBSCRIBE
TO
THAT
VIEW
GOD
MAY
CHOOSE
ONE
INDIVIDUAL
OVER
ANOTHER
AS
THE
FIT
INSTRUMENT
FOR
HIS
PLANS
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
PRECLUDE
THAT
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THAT
INDIVIDUAL
INTO
WHAT
HE
IS
IN
THIS
EARTHLY
LIFE
IS
NOT
THE
RESULT
OF
A
LONGER
COURSE
OF
DEVELOPMENT
I
DO
NOT
AND
RUDOLF
STEINER
DID
NOT
SUBSCRIBE
TO
THE
ORIENTAL
VIEW
OF
AN
INEXORABLE
MECHANISTIC
KARMA
DETERMINING
EVERYTHING
THAT
BEFALLS
ONE
THIS
IS
A
KIND
OF
SHRIVELED
CARICATURE
OF
A
MUCH
GREATER
LAW
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
WHICH
THE
DEED
OF
CHRIST
ON
GOLGOTHA
AND
THE
ULTIMATE
SALVATION
AND
FREEDOM
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING
AS
A
WORKING
OF
CHRIST
CAN
BE
SEEN
AS
THE
MASTER
THEME
AND
INDEED
A
NEW
IMPULSE
THAT
WAS
COMPLETELY
FREE
OF
KARMA
CHRIST
INCARNATED
ONLY
ONCE
IN
THE
FLESH
AND
IN
THAT
HE
HAD
NO
DEBT
OF
KARMA
OR
SIN
THE
ORIENTAL
CONCEPTS
OF
REINCARNATION
AND
KARMA
WHICH
ARE
EVEN
MORE
TRIVIALIZED
AND
MECHANIZED
IN
SOME
NEW
AGE
TEACHINGS
INCORRECTLY
ASSUME
JESUS
CHRIST
TO
HAVE
BEEN
THE
REINCARNATION
OF
A
MASTER
AVATAR
ETC
THEIR
TEACHING
OF
REINCARNATION
AND
KARMA
ALSO
HAS
NO
CONCEPT
THE
CONTINUING
INDIVIDUALITY
FROM
ONE
LIFE
TO
THE
NEXT
EG
BUDDHISM
MORE
IMPORTANT
THEY
HAVE
NO
CONCEPT
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
BODY
THE
ULTIMATE
CONTINUITY
OF
THE
WHOLE
HUMAN
BEING
TO
ULTIMATE
RESURRECTION
AND
JUDGEMENT
ON
THE
LAST
DAY
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
BIBLICAL
PASSAGE
THAT
ALSO
HAS
A
BEARING
IT
IS
THE
TENTH
CHAPTER
OF
JOHN
DEVOTED
ALMOST
ENTIRELY
TO
THE
MAN
BORN
BLIND
CLEARLY
HERE
JESUS
TELLS
THE
DISCIPLES
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
HIS
PAST
KARMA
OR
THAT
OF
HIS
PARENTS
THAT
LED
TO
HIS
BLINDNESS
BUT
RATHER
THAT
A
NEW
IMPULSE
IS
TO
BE
REVEALED
THROUGH
HIM
BUT
NOTE
THAT
HE
DOES
NOT
REFUTE
THE
DISCIPLES
QUESTION
IN
FACT
THEY
ASK
IT
AS
A
MATTER
OF
COURSE
THE
QUESTION
BEING
STATED
AS
IF
IT
WERE
SELF
EVIDENT
THAT
ONLY
ONE
OF
TWO
POSSIBILITIES
EXISTED
IT
WAS
EITHER
THE
SINS
OF
THE
MAN
HIMSELF
OBVIOUSLY
NOT
IN
THIS
INCARNATION
OR
THE
SINS
OF
HIS
PARENTS
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
EVEN
ASKED
ABOUT
THE
FIRST
POSSIBILITY
AT
ALL
INDICATES
AN
AWARENESS
OF
THE
IDEA
ON
THEIR
PART
AND
THE
FORM
OF
CHRISTS
ANSWER
INDICATES
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
DISAGREE
WITH
IT
THERE
IS
ALSO
MATTHEW
WHERE
JESUS
SAYS
STRAIGHT
OUT
ABOUT
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
IF
YOU
CARE
TO
ACCEPT
IT
HE
HIMSELF
IS
ELIAS
WHO
WAS
TO
COME
THIS
ALSO
EMPHASIZES
THAT
THE
GOSPELS
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
POSITIVE
TEACHING
EITHER
WAY
ABOUT
REINCARNATION
OR
IN
FACT
ABOUT
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
THE
HUMAN
BEING
AT
ALL
BETWEEN
DEATH
AND
THE
LAST
DAY
EVEN
JESUS
DID
NOT
PUSH
THIS
TEACHING
ON
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
NOT
READY
TO
EMBRACE
IT
IF
YOU
CARE
TO
ACCEPT
IT
SO
I
TOOK
CARE
TO
POINT
OUT
NOT
THAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
REINCARNATION
BUT
THAT
IT
DOES
NOT
DENY
IT
EITHER
AND
THAT
MUCH
IN
BOTH
SCRIPTURE
AND
FUNDAMENTAL
CHRISTIAN
DOCTRINE
BECOMES
UNDERSTANDABLE
IF
REINCARNATION
IS
UNDERSTOOD
IN
THE
RIGHT
WAY
I
POINTEDLY
USED
REPEATED
EARTH
LIVES
TO
DISTINGUISH
A
LITTLE
FROM
THE
ORIENTAL
DOCTRINES
USUALLY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
WORD
REINCARNATION
THE
PHRASE
IS
RUDOLF
STEINERS
WIEDERHOLTE
ERDENLEBEN
HE
NOTED
TOO
THAT
THE
IDEA
NEEDED
TO
ARISE
AS
A
NEW
INSIGHT
IN
THE
WEST
COMPLETELY
FREE
FROM
EASTERN
TRADITION
IT
DID
IN
THE
EIGHTEENTH
AND
NINETEENTH
CENTURIES
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
EXPRESSION
OF
IT
BEING
LESSINGS
THE
EDUCATION
OF
THE
HUMAN
RACE
TO
RETURN
TO
YOUR
ORIGINAL
POINT
PAULS
STATEMENT
ABOUT
JACOB
AND
ESAU
DOES
NOT
CONTRADICT
THE
IDEA
OF
REPEATED
EARTH
LIVES
AND
KARMA
AND
BOTH
OF
THESE
PRINCIPLES
RECEIVE
THEIR
FULFILLMENT
IN
THE
INCARNATION
DEATH
AND
RESURRECTION
ASCENSION
AND
RETURN
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
IN
MY
VIEW
