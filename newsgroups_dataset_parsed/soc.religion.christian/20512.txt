RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
VIRGILIO
DEAN
B
VELASCO
JR
WRITES
I
JUST
THOUGHT
ID
SHARE
SOME
WORDS
THAT
I
RECEIVED
IN
A
LETTER
FROM
MOODY
BIBLE
INSTITUTE
A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
AGO
THE
WORDS
ARE
BY
JAMES
M
STOWELL
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
MBI
THE
OTHER
DAY
I
WAS
AT
THE
DRY
CLEANER
AND
THE
RADIO
WAS
PLAYING
IT
CAUGHT
MY
ATTENTION
BECAUSE
A
TALK
SHOW
GUEST
WAS
CRITICIZING
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS
SAYING
WE
BELIEVE
IN
ABSOLUTES
AND
THINK
WE
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ABSOLUTES
ARE
HE
MISSED
THE
POINT
NO
IMO
MR
STOWELL
MISSED
THE
POINT
WE
AFFIRM
THE
ABSOLUTES
OF
SCRIPTURE
NOT
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
ARROGANT
MORALISTS
BUT
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
WHO
IS
TRUTH
WHO
HAS
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTH
IN
HIS
WORD
AND
THEREFORE
WE
HOLD
AS
PRECIOUS
THE
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
OF
THOSE
ABSOLUTES
MR
STOWELL
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
JUMPED
RATHER
STRANGELY
FROM
TRUTH
TO
ABSOLUTES
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
THAT
NECESSARILY
FOLLOWS
ARE
ALL
TRUTHS
ALSO
ABSOLUTES
IS
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
TRUTHS
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTES
IF
THE
ANSWER
TO
EITHER
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
IS
NO
THEN
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
HOW
YOU
DETERMINE
WHICH
PARTS
OF
SCRIPTURE
ARE
TRUTHS
AND
WHICH
TRUTHS
ARE
ABSOLUTES
AND
WHO
IS
QUALIFIED
TO
MAKE
THESE
DETERMINATIONS
THERE
IS
HARDLY
CONSENSUS
EVEN
IN
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANITY
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
REST
OF
CHRISTIANITY
REGARDING
BIBLICAL
INTERPRETATION
I
FIND
MR
STOWELLS
STATEMENT
TERRIBLY
SIMPLEMINDED
