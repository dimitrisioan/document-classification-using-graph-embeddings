RE
IF
THERE
WERE
NO
HELL
LARRY
L
OVERACKER
WRITES
Q
IF
YOU
KNEW
BEYOND
ALL
DOUBT
THAT
HELL
DID
NOT
EXIST
AND
THAT
UNBELIEVERS
SIMPLY
REMAINED
DEAD
WOULD
YOU
REMAIN
A
CHRISTIAN
MY
CONTENTION
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
WITH
NO
I
WOULD
NOT
THEN
REMAIN
A
CHRISTIAN
THEN
YOU
REALLY
ARE
NOT
ONE
NOW
I
FOLLOW
CHRIST
BECAUSE
ITS
A
GREAT
WAY
TO
LIVE
LIFE
AND
I
COULD
CARE
LESS
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENS
AFTER
I
DIE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
A
RESURRECTION
BUT
THAT
WONT
HAVE
ANY
EFFECT
ON
HOW
I
LIVE
THIS
LIFE
OUCH
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
QUESTION
TO
ME
NOT
EXISTING
IS
WORSE
THAN
EXISTING
NO
MATTER
WHAT
SO
I
WILL
MODIFY
THIS
QUESTION
TO
BE
WOULD
I
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
IF
IT
MADE
NO
ETERNAL
DIFFERENCE
IN
MY
REWARD
OR
PUNISHMENT
I
HOPE
THIS
IS
IN
THE
SAME
SPIRIT
YOU
WANT
I
PERSONALLY
AM
VERY
GOAL
ORIENTED
IT
IS
HARD
FOR
ME
TO
DO
THINGS
THAT
DO
NOT
ACHIEVE
SOME
GOAL
HOWEVER
TO
RELATE
THIS
TO
SPORTS
ONLY
AFTER
I
LEARNED
TO
NOT
CARE
ABOUT
THE
SCORE
DID
I
BECOME
A
GOOD
BASKETBALL
PLAYER
I
HAD
TO
LEARN
TO
GO
ALL
OUT
NO
MATTER
THE
SITUATION
PERHAPS
THIS
LESSON
IS
RELEVENT
AFTER
ALL
ONLY
IF
I
CAN
GIVE
UP
MY
LIFE
CAN
I
KEEP
IT
ONLY
IF
I
AM
HUMBLE
CAN
I
ACHIEVE
GLORY
ONLY
IF
I
CONCENTRATE
ON
LIVING
MY
LIFE
NOW
THE
BEST
I
CAN
WILL
I
BE
AFFORDED
LIFE
ETERNAL
I
THINK
YOU
HAVE
ILLUMINATED
THE
TRUE
MEANING
OF
SAVED
BY
FAITH
BUT
WHAT
IS
MY
ANSWER
RIGHT
NOW
I
WOULD
REMAIN
A
CHRISTIAN
HOWEVER
WAS
THAT
ALWAYS
MY
ANSWER
THATS
THE
PROBLEM
HEAVEN
AND
HELL
ARE
GOOD
MOTIVATORS
AT
CERTAIN
STAGES
OF
MATURITY
AND
I
ADMIT
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
TIMES
WHEN
PERHAPS
I
BITE
MY
TONGUE
AND
PUT
UP
WITH
SOMETHING
IN
THE
HOPE
OF
A
BETTER
DAY
IE
I
MENTALLY
TRADE
PRESENT
HAPPINESS
FOR
FUTURE
HAPPINESS
I
HOPE
THE
CYNICS
AND
SKEPTICS
DO
NOT
READ
MORE
INTO
THAT
THAN
APPROPRIATE
BUT
I
AM
TRYING
TO
BE
HONEST
SCOTT
A
MAYO
WRITES
OF
COURSE
BUT
IT
IS
A
POINTLESS
QUESTION
BECAUSE
YOU
CANNOT
KNOW
BEYOND
ALL
DOUBT
THAT
HELL
DOES
NOT
EXIST
ANYMORE
THAN
YOU
CAN
KNOW
IT
DOES
SHORT
OF
TAKING
JESUSS
WORD
FOR
IT
WHAT
IF
QUESTIONS
ARE
FUN
AND
ENTERTAINING
BUT
PROBABLY
FRUITLESS
I
THINK
THESE
KINDS
OF
QUESTIONS
ARE
EXTREMELY
FRUITFUL
I
GUESS
IT
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
ONE
VIEWS
KNOWLEDGE
AND
LEARNING
BY
STRIPPING
IDEAS
TO
SIMPLE
STRAIGHTFORWARD
OPPOSING
CONCEPTS
WE
CAN
DETERMINE
LEVELS
OF
IMPORTANCE
BY
ANALYZING
THE
THEORETICALLY
ABSURD
WE
CAN
GAIN
A
BETTER
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
ACTUALLY
ABSURD
