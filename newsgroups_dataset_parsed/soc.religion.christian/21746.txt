LARRY
L
OVERACKER
WRITES
EARLY
IN
CHURCH
HISTORY
THE
CATECHUMENS
WERE
DISMISSED
PRIOR
TO
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
EUCHARIST
IT
WAS
SECRET
GIVING
RISE
TO
THE
RUMORS
THAT
CHRISTIANS
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
IDEA
THAT
CATECHUMENS
BE
DISMISSED
BEFORE
THE
EUCHARIST
THEY
WERE
NOT
CONSIDERED
QUALIFIED
TO
PARTICIPATE
WERE
CANNIBALS
AND
ALL
SORTS
OF
PERVERSE
CLAIMS
THE
ACTIONS
WERE
CONSIDERED
TOO
HOLY
TO
BE
OBSERVED
BY
NONCHRISTIANS
AS
WELL
AS
POTENTIALLY
DANGEROUS
FOR
THE
INDIVIDUAL
CHRISTIAN
WHO
MIGHT
BE
IDENTIFIED
DOES
THE
DISMISSAL
IN
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
MEAN
THAT
THE
EUCHARIST
WAS
A
SECRET
I
MEAN
WAS
IT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
STAY
FROM
NOW
ON
ONLY
THE
MEMBERSHIP
CAN
PARTICIPATE
YOU
REALLY
DONT
HAVE
TO
HANG
AROUND
YES
I
KNOW
YOURE
OBLIGED
TO
KEEP
UP
ATTENDANCE
TO
QUALIFY
BUT
NOW
IS
AN
EXCEPTION
OKAY
OR
WAS
IT
YOU
MAY
NOT
STAY
WHAT
HAPPENS
NEXT
IS
SECRET
WHEN
WE
HAVE
HAD
REASON
TO
CONDUCT
BUSINESS
MEETINGS
AFTER
CHURCH
WEVE
MADE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
ONLY
MEMBERS
CAN
VOTE
BUT
WEVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
HAPPY
FOR
NONMEMBERS
TO
STAY
AND
OBSERVE
DO
YOU
HAVE
EVIDENCE
FOR
INTENTIONAL
SECRECY
OTHER
THAN
RUMOURS
WHICH
WILL
ALWAYS
HAPPEN
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
AN
UNDERCLASS
DOING
THINGS
NOT
APPROVED
OF
BY
THOSE
IN
POWER
