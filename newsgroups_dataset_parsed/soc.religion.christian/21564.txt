OVERACKER
WRITES
I
NOT
DAVE
DAVIS
WROTE
THE
DEUTEROCANONICAL
BOOKS
WERE
ADDED
MUCH
LATER
IN
THE
CHURCHS
HISTORY
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
SAME
SPIRITUAL
QUALITY
AS
THE
REST
OF
SCRIPTURE
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THE
CHURCH
THAT
ADDED
THESE
BOOKS
WAS
GUIDED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
IN
SO
DOING
AND
THAT
IS
WHERE
THIS
SORT
OF
DISCUSSION
ULTIMATELY
ENDS
SORRY
I
PUT
MY
FOOT
IN
MY
MOUTH
CONCERNING
THE
CHURCHS
HISTORY
IT
IS
CORRECT
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
COUNCIL
OF
HIPPO
LISTED
THE
DEUTEROCANONICAL
BOOKS
AMONG
THOSE
ACCEPTED
FOR
USE
IN
THE
CHURCH
AND
THAT
THIS
WAS
RATIFIED
BY
THE
COUNCIL
OF
CARTHAGE
AND
BY
POPE
INNOENT
I
AND
GELASIUS
I
AD
YET
EERDMANS
HISTORY
OF
THE
CHURCH
SAYS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
FOURTH
CENTURY
VIEWS
STILL
DIFFERED
IN
REGARD
TO
THE
EXTENT
OF
THE
CANON
OR
THE
NUMBER
OF
THE
BOOKS
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
ACKNOWLEDGED
AS
DIVINE
AND
AUTHORITATIVE
THE
JEWISH
CANON
OR
THE
HEBREW
BIBLE
WAS
UNIVERSALLY
RECEIVED
WHILE
THE
APOCRYPHA
ADDED
TO
THE
GREEK
VERSION
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
WERE
ONLY
IN
A
GENERAL
WAY
ACCOUNTED
AS
BOOKS
SUITABLE
FOR
CHURCH
READING
AND
THUS
AS
A
MIDDLE
CLASS
BETWEEN
CANONICAL
AND
STRICTLY
APOCRYPHAL
PSEUDONYMOUS
WRITINGS
AND
JUSTLY
FOR
THOSE
BOOKS
WHILE
THEY
HAVE
GREAT
HISTORICAL
VALUE
AND
FILL
THE
GAP
BETWEEN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
AND
THE
NEW
ALL
ORIGINATED
AFTER
THE
CESSATION
OF
PROPHECY
AND
THE
CANNOT
BE
THEREFORE
REGARDED
AS
INSPIRED
NOR
ARE
THEY
EVER
CITED
BY
CHRIST
OR
THE
APOSTELES
IN
THE
WESTERN
CHURCH
THE
CANON
OF
BOTH
TESTAMENTS
WAS
CLOSED
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
FOURTH
CENTURY
THROUGH
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
JEROME
WHO
WAVERED
HOWEVER
BETWEEN
CRITICAL
DOUBTS
AND
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
TRADITION
AND
MORE
ESPECIALLY
OF
AUGUSTINE
WHO
FIRMLY
FOLLOWED
THE
ALEXANDRIAN
CANON
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
AND
THE
PREPONDERANT
TRADITION
IN
REFERENCE
TO
THE
CATHOLIC
EPISTLES
AND
THE
REVELATION
THOUGH
HE
HIMSELF
IN
SOME
PLACES
INCLINES
TO
CONSIDER
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
APOCRYPHA
AS
DEUTERO
CANONICAL
BEARING
A
SUBORDINATE
AUTHORITY
THIS
HISTORY
GOES
ON
TO
SAY
THAT
AUGUSTINE
ATTENDED
BOTH
THE
COUNCIL
OF
HIPPO
AND
OF
CARTHAGE
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
HOWEVER
THE
FOLLOWING
FOOTNOTE
TO
THE
FOURTH
SESSION
OF
THE
COUNCIL
OF
TRENT
THE
FOOTNOTE
LISTS
VARIOUS
SYNODS
WHICH
ENDORSED
LISTS
OF
CANONICAL
BOOKS
BUT
THEN
SAYS
THE
TRIDENTINE
LIST
OR
DECREE
WAS
THE
FIRST
INFALLIBLE
AND
EFFECTUALLY
PROMULGATED
DECLARATION
ON
THE
CANON
OF
THE
HOLY
SCRIPTURES
WHICH
LEADS
ONE
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
RC
CANON
WAS
NOT
OFFICIAL
UNTIL
TRENT
THUS
MY
PREVIOUS
ERRONEOUS
STATEMENT
WAS
NOT
ENTIRELY
GROUNDLESS
IT
IS
ALSO
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
COUNCIL
OF
TRENT
WENT
ON
TO
UPHOLD
THE
OLD
LATIN
VULGATE
EDITION
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
AS
AUTHENTIC
WHICH
I
WOULD
SUPPOSE
TODAYS
CATHOLIC
SCHOLARS
WISH
THE
COUNCIL
HAD
NEVER
SAID
ALSO
THE
COUNCIL
MADE
NO
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
DEUTEROCANONICAL
AND
CANONICAL
BOOKSIN
