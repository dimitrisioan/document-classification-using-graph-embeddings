PRAYING
FOR
JUSTICE
BY
PETER
HAMMOND
TO
THOSE
INVOLVED
IN
MINISTERING
TO
CHRISTIANS
SUFFERING
PERSECUTION
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
ARE
A
TREMENDOUS
SOURCE
OF
COMFORT
AND
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
ARE
FIGHTING
FOR
THE
RIGHT
TO
LIFE
OF
THE
PREBORN
OR
BATTLING
SOCIAL
EVILS
SUCH
AS
PORNOGRAPHY
OR
CRIME
ARE
BEGINNING
TO
APPRECIATE
WHAT
AN
IMPORTANT
WEAPON
GOD
HAS
ENTRUSTED
TO
US
IN
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
EARLY
IN
MY
CHRISTIAN
WALK
I
ENCOUNTERED
THE
PRAYERS
FOR
JUDGEMENT
IN
THE
PSALMS
AND
WAS
QUITE
AT
LOSS
TO
KNOW
HOW
TO
RESPOND
TO
THEM
PRAYERS
SUCH
AS
BREAK
THE
ARM
OF
THE
WICKED
AND
EVIL
MEN
CALL
HIM
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
HIS
WICKEDNESS
PSALM
DID
NOT
SEEM
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
GOSPEL
OF
LOVE
WHICH
I
HAD
ACCEPTED
YET
PSALM
WAS
CLEARLY
MOTIVATED
BY
LOVE
FOR
GOD
THE
LORD
IS
KING
FOR
EVER
AND
EVER
THE
NATION
WILL
PERISH
FROM
HIS
LAND
AND
WHY
DOES
THE
WICKED
MAN
REVILE
GOD
AND
BY
LOVE
FOR
THE
INNOCENT
WHO
SUFFER
YOU
HEAR
O
LORD
THE
DESIRE
OF
THE
AFFLICTED
YOU
ENCOURAGE
THEM
AND
YOU
LISTEN
TO
THEIR
CRY
DEFENDING
THE
FATHERLESS
AND
OPPRESSED
IN
ORDER
THAT
MAN
WHO
IS
OF
THE
EARTH
MAY
TERRIFY
NO
MORE
NEVERTHELESS
I
GREW
INCREASINGLY
UNCOMFORTABLE
READING
SUCH
GRAPHIC
PRAYERS
FOR
GOD
TO
JUDGE
THE
WICKED
AS
POUR
OUT
YOUR
WRATH
ON
THEM
LET
YOUR
FIERCE
ANGER
OVERTAKE
THEM
O
LORD
THE
GOD
AVENGES
O
GOD
WHO
AVENGES
SHINE
FORTH
RISE
UP
O
JUDGE
OF
THE
EARTH
PAY
BACK
TO
THE
PROUD
WHAT
THEY
DESERVE
BREAK
THE
TEETH
IN
THEIR
MOUTHS
O
GOD
LET
THEM
VANISH
LIKE
WATER
LET
THEIR
ARROWS
BE
BLUNTED
THE
RIGHTEOUS
WILL
BE
GLAD
WHEN
THEY
ARE
AVENGED
WHEN
THEY
BATHE
THEIR
FEET
IN
THE
BLOOD
OF
THE
WICKED
THEN
MEN
WILL
WAY
SURELY
THE
RIGHTEOUS
STILL
ARE
REWARDED
SURELY
THERE
IS
A
GOD
WHO
JUDGES
THE
EARTH
CERTAINLY
I
WANTED
GOD
TO
BE
HONOURED
AND
YES
I
WAS
DEEPLY
DESTRESSED
BY
THE
PREVALENCE
OF
EVIL
BUT
COULD
I
ACTUALLY
PRAY
FOR
GOD
TO
POUR
OUT
HIS
WRATH
ON
THE
WICKED
THE
SCRIPTURE
MAKE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
THESE
PRAYERS
ARE
NOT
TO
BE
PRAYED
FOR
OWN
SELFISH
MOTIVES
NOR
AGAINST
OUR
PERSONAL
ENEMIES
RATHER
THEY
ARE
TO
BE
PRAYED
IN
CHRIST
FOR
HIS
GLORY
AND
AGAINST
HIS
ENEMIES
THE
PSALMIST
DESCRIBES
THE
TARGETS
OF
THESE
IMPRECATION
AS
THOSE
WHO
DEVISE
INJUSTICE
IN
THEIR
HEART
AND
WHOSE
HANDS
METE
OUT
VIOLENCE
THOSE
WHO
BOAST
OF
EVIL
AND
ARE
A
DISGRACE
IN
THE
EYES
OF
GOD
YOUR
TONGUE
PLOTS
DESTRUCTION
IT
IS
LIKE
A
SHARPENED
RAZOR
AND
YOU
WHO
PRACTISE
DECEIT
YOU
LOVE
EVIL
RATHER
THAN
GOOD
FALSEHOOD
RATHER
THAN
SPEAKING
THE
TRUTH
THEY
CRUSH
YOUR
PEOPLE
THEY
SLAY
THE
WIDOW
AND
THE
ALIEN
THEY
MURDER
THE
FATHERLESS
WITH
CUNNING
THEY
CONSPIRE
AGAINST
YOUR
PEOPLE
THEY
PLOT
AGAINST
THOSE
YOU
CHERISH
YOU
HATE
ALL
WHO
DO
WRONG
YOU
DESTROY
THOSE
WHO
TELL
LIES
BLOODTHIRSTY
AND
DECEITFUL
MEN
THE
LORD
ABHORS
TO
THOSE
UNREPENTANT
ENEMIES
OF
GOD
THE
PSALMIST
DECLARES
SURELY
GOD
WILL
BRING
YOU
DOWN
TO
EVERLASTING
RUIN
SURELY
GOD
WILL
CRUSH
THE
HEADS
OF
HIS
ENEMIES
OF
THOSE
WHO
GO
ON
IN
THEIR
SINS
AND
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THESE
PRAYERS
FOR
JUSTICE
IS
DECLARED
THEN
IT
WILL
BE
KNOWN
TO
THE
ENDS
OF
THE
EARTH
THAT
GOD
RULES
TO
PROCLAIM
THE
POWERS
OF
GOD
ALL
KINGS
WILL
BOW
DOWN
TO
HIM
AND
ALL
NATIONS
WILL
SERVE
HIM
WHO
KNOWS
THE
POWER
OF
YOUR
ANGER
FOR
YOUR
WRATH
IS
AS
GREAT
AS
THE
FEAR
THAT
IS
DUE
YOU
YET
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
OF
THE
PSALMS
INCLUDE
IMPRECATIONS
PRAYERS
INVOKING
GODS
RIGHTEOUS
JUDGEMENT
UPON
THE
WICKED
SUCH
PRAYERS
ARE
RARE
IN
THE
AVERAGE
WESTERN
CHURCH
HOWEVER
AMONGST
THE
PERSECUTED
CHURCHES
THESE
PRAYERS
ARE
MUCH
MORE
COMMON
PRAYING
AGAINST
THE
PERSECUTORS
AMIDST
THE
BURNT
OUT
CHURCHES
AND
DEVASTATION
OF
MARXIST
ANGOLA
I
FOUND
THE
SURVIVORS
OF
COMMUNIST
PERSECUTION
INCLUDING
THE
CRIPPLED
AND
MAIMED
AND
WIDOWS
AND
ORPHANS
PRAYING
FOR
GOD
TO
STRIKE
DOWN
THE
WICKED
AND
REMOVE
THE
PERSECUTORS
OF
THE
CHURCH
I
WAS
SHOCKED
YET
IT
WAS
BIBLICAL
EVEN
THE
MARTYRS
IN
HEAVEN
PRAY
HOW
LONG
SOVEREIGN
LORD
HOLY
AND
TRUE
UNTIL
YOU
JUDGE
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE

AND
AVENGE
OUR
BLOOD

HE
BOASTED
THAT
WITHIN
YEARS
THERE
WONT
BE
A
BIBLE
OR
A
CHURCH
LEFT
IN
ANGOLA
I
WILL
HAVE
ERADICATED
CHRISTIANITY
YET
DESPITE
THE
VICIOUS
WAVE
OF
CHURCH
BURNING
AND
MASSACRES
IT
IS
NOT
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
WAS
ERADICATED
IN
ANGOLA
BUT
AGESTINO
NETO

DIED
IN
MYSTERIOUS
CIRCUMSTANCES
ON

THE

WAS
INFORMED
THAT
HE
HAD

DIED
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS
ON
ANOTHER

DEMOLISHED
BY

WAS
GIVEN
TO

WERE
DISCOVERED
AND
PUBLISHED
NOT
ONLY
HAD
GOD
JUDGED
A
BLASPHEMER
AND
A

HAD
ALSO
SAVED
A

FROM
PERSECUTION
IN
THE
MONTHS
LEADING
UP
TO
THE
FIRST
MULTIPARTY
ELECTIONS
IN

WAS
DONE
ON

TEN
THOUSAND
ON
APRIL
THE
SECRETARY
GENERAL
OF
THE
SOUTH
AFRICAN
COMMUNIST
PARTY
CHRIS
HANI
WAS
SHOT
DEAD
FROM
THE
UNPRECEDENTED
INTERNATIONAL
WAVE
OF
CONDOLENCES
AND
ADULATION
REPORTED
ONE
COULD
BE
FORGIVEN
FOR
ASSUMING
THAT
THIS
MAN
WAS
A
SAINT
AND
A
MARTYR
CERTAINLY
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
DEATH
AND
RESURRECTION
OF
CHRIST
JESUS
WHICH
DOMINATED
THE
THOUGHTS
AND
HEADLINES
OF
SOUTH
AFRICA
THIS
EASTER
BUT
THE
ASSASSINATION
OF
CHRIS
HANI
THE
STUNNING
HYPOCRISY
OF
THE
SITUATION
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
WERE
MURDERED
IN
SOUTH
AFRICA
IN
YET
MORE
COLLECTIVE
CONCERN
AND
ANGUISH
WERE
REPORTED
OVER
THE
DEATH
OF
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
SA

PARTY
THAN
FOR
ALL
THE
THOUSANDS
OF
OTHER
VICTIMS
INDEED
THE
SA
GOVERNMENT
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY
AND
THE
MASS
MEDIA
HAVE
APPARENTLY
HAD
GREATER
SORROW
REPORTED
OVER
THIS
ONE
DEATH
THAN
FOR
ALL
THE
SOUTH
AFRICANS
MURDERED
SINCE
FEBRUARY
WHEN
THE
ANC
SACP
AND
PAC
WERE
UNBANNED

FROM

HAD
APPROVED
AND
ORDERED

AND
ASSASSINATIONS
OF
MANY
UNARMED

AS
JESUS
WARNED
ALL
WHO

BY
THE
SWORD
WILL
DIE
BY

SWORD
MATT
AFTER
PERSONALLY
CONFRONTING
HANI
ABOUT
HIS
TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES
AT
A
PRESS
CONFERENCE
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
WHERE
HE
PUBLICLY
DECLARED
HIS
SUPPORT
FOR
FIDEL
CASTRO
COL
GADDAFI
YASSER
ARAFAT
AND
SADDAM
HUSSEIN
AND
DEFENDED
THE
PLACING
OF
CAR
BOMBS
AND
LIMPET
MINES
IN
PUBLIC
PLACES
DURING
THE
STRUGGLE
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
I
WAS
A
CHRISTIAN
AND
WHILE
I
DIDNT
HATE
HIM
I
DID
HATE
COMMUNISM
AND
I
WAS
PRAYING
FOR
HIM
THAT
GOD
WOULD
EITHER
BRING
HIM
TO
REPENTANCE
AND
SALVATION
IN
CHRIST
OR
THAT
GOD
WOULD
REMOVE
HIM
HE
RESPONDED
BY
SWEARING
AND
DECLARING
THAT
HE
WAS
AN
ATHEIST
SEVERAL
OTHER
PEOPLE
ALSO
PRAYED
THAT
GOD
WOULD
EITHER
BRING
HANI
TO
REPENTANCE
OR
REMOVE
HIM
SIMILARLY
SEVERAL
CHURCHES
IN
AMERICA
HAVE
BEGUN
TO
PRAY
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
AGAINST
UNREPENTANT
ABORTIONISTS
IN
ONE
TOWN
ABORTIONISTS
WERE
STRUCK
DOWN
WITH
HEART
ATTACKS
STROKES
CAR
ACCIDENTS
AND
CANCER
WITHIN
MONTHS
OF
THESE
PUBLIC
PRAYERS
FOR
GOD
TO
STOP
THESE
KILLERS
OF
PREBORN
BABIES
SOME
PRAISED
GOD
FOR
HIS
RIGHTEOUS
ACTS
OF
JUDGEMENT
AND
QUOTED
WHEN
JUSTICE
IS
DONE
IT
BRINGS
JOY
TO
THE
RIGHTEOUS
AND
TERROR
TO
EVILDOERS
PROVERBS
OTHERS
WERE
SHOCKED
THAT
ANY
CHRISTIAN
COULD
EXPRESS
SATISFACTION
AT
THE
MISFORTUNE
OF
ANY
EVEN
OF
THE
BLATANTLY
WICKED
YET
THE
APOSTLES
PRAYED
IMPRECATORY
PRAYERS
ACTS
GALATIANS
TIM
AND
SO
DID
OUR
LORD
MATT
WHAT
THEN
SHOULD
OUR
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
BE
SHOULD
WE
BE
PRAYING
THE
PSALMS
TO
TACKLE
THESE
THORNY
ISSUES
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
PRESENT
A
SHORT
SUMMARY
OF
AN
EXCELLENT
BOOK
WAR
PSALMS
OF
THE
PRINCE
OF
PEACE
LESSONS
FROM
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
BY
JAMES
E
ADAMS
PUBLISHED
BY
THE
PRESBYTERIAN
AND
REFORMED
PUBLISHING
COMPANY
OUR
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
HIS
APOSTLES
USED
THE
PSALMS
CONSTANTLY
IN
TEACHING
MEN
TO
KNOW
GOD
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
NT
QUOTES
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
OT
OVER
TIMES
OF
ALL
OT
QUOTES
IN
THE
NT
ARE
FROM
THE
PSALMS
CHRIST
HIMSELF
ALLUDED
TO
THE
PSALMS
OVER
TIMES
THE
PSALMS
ARE
THE
PRAYER
BOOK
OF
THE
BIBLE
ARE
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
THE
ORACLES
OF
GOD
SOME
CHRISTIAN
COMMENTATORS
THEOLOGIANS
REJECT
THESE
PSALMS
AS
DEVILISH
DIABOLICAL
UNSUITED
TO
THE
CHURCH
AND
NOT
GOD
S
PRONOUNCEMENTS
OF
HIS
WRATH
ON
THE
WICKED
BUT
THE
PRAYERS
OF
A
MAN
FOR
VENGEANCE
ON
HIS
ENEMIES
JUST
THE
OPPOSITE
OF
JESUS
TEACHING
THAT
WE
SHOULD
LOVE
OUR
ENEMIES
YET
TIM
DECLARES
ALL
SCRIPTURE
IS
GOD
BREATHED
AND
IS
USEFUL
FOR
TEACHING
REBUKING
CORRECTING
AND
TRAINING
IN
RIGHTEOUSNESS
SO
THAT
THE
MAN
OF
GOD
MAY
BE
THOROUGHLY
EQUIPPED
FOR
EVERY
GOOD
WORK
SEE
ALSO
PETER
THE
FACT
THAT
SOMETHING
IN
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
IS
BEYOND
OUR
COMPREHENSION
IS
NOT
GROUNDS
TO
DENYING
OR
EVEN
QUESTIONING
ITS
INSPIRATION
TO
MAKE
OURSELVES
THE
JUDGE
OF
WHAT
IS
GOOD
OR
EVIL
IS
TO
IMPUDENTLY
TAKE
THE
PLACE
OF
GOD
DO
WE
IMAGINE
OURSELVES
TO
BE
HOLIER
THAN
GOD
WRONG
IDEAS
OF
GOD
HAVE
LED
MANY
TO
BECOME
EVANGELIC
PLASTIC
SURGEONS
WHO
HAVE
MADE
IT
THEIR
JOB
TO
CLEAN
UP
GODS
WORD
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
OWN
IDEAS
OF
WHAT
IS
PROPER
THEY
HAVE
FORGOTTEN
THAT
IT
IS
GOD
ALONE
WHO
MUST
DETERMINE
WHAT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
AND
WHAT
IS
SUITABLE
FOR
HIS
CHURCH
THE
ESSENCE
OF
WHAT
MANY
HAVE
DONE
IS
TO
QUESTION
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
GODS
WORD
LIKE
EVES
ORIGINAL
SIN
OF
LISTENING
TO
SATANS
QUESTION
YES
HATH
GOD
SAID
THE
PSALMS
ARE
PART
OF
GODS
REVELATION
OF
HIMSELF
AND
HIS
ATTRIBUTES
AND
THEY
ARE
REAFFIRMED
BY
THE
NT
AS
THE
AUTHORITATIVE
WORD
OF
GOD
THOSE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
WHICH
THESE
EVANGELICAL
PLASTIC
SURGEONS
REJECT
AS
UNSUITED
AND
UNWORTHY
FOR
THE
CHURCH
ARE
THE
VERY
PSALMS
CHRIST
USED
TO
TESTIFY
ABOUT
HIMSELF
EG
MARK
MATT
AND
WHICH
THE
APOSTLES
USED
AS
AUTHORITATIVE
SCRIPTURE
EG
ACTS
ACTS
HEB
SEE
ALSO
SAMUEL
CH
SPURGEON
SAID
CONCERNING
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
ESPECIALLY
PS
TRULY
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
HARD
PLACES
OF
SCRIPTURE
A
PASSAGE
WHICH
THE
SOUL
TREMBLES
TO
READ
YET
IT
IS
NOT
OURS
TO
SIT
IN
JUDGEMENT
UPON

OUR
EAR
TO
WHAT
THE
LORD
WOULD
SPEAK
TO
US
THEREIN
THE
REJECTION
OF
ANY

IS
A

OF
THE

OF
THAT

GOD
HIMSELF
WHO
IS
PRAYING
THESE
PSALMS
CHRIST
QUOTED
THE
PSALMS
NOT
MERELY
AS
PROPHESY
HE
ACTUALLY
SPOKE
THE
PSALMS
AS
HIS
OWN
WORDS
THE
PSALMS
OCCUPIED
AN
ENORMOUS
PLACE
IN
THE
LIFE
OF
OUR
LORD
HE
USED
IT
AS
HIS
PRAYER
BOOK
AND
SONG
BOOK
FROM
THE
SYNAGOGUE
TO
THE
FESTIVALS
AND
AT
THE
LAST
SUPPER
ON
THE
CROSS
CHRIST
QUOTED
FROM
THE
PSALMS
NOT
AS
SOME
ANCIENT
AUTHORITY
THAT
HE
ADAPTED
FOR
HIS
OWN
USE
BUT
AS
HIS
VERY
OWN
WORDS
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
LORDS
ANOINTED
WHICH
AS
DAVIDS
SON
HE
TRULY
WAS
FATHER
INTO
YOUR

I
COMMIT
MY

PS
MY

MY

WHY
HAVE
YOU
FORSAKEN
ME
PS
IN

CHRIST
FORETELLS
WHAT
HE
WILL
SAY
AS
THE
JUDGE
ON
THE
DAY
OF
JUDGEMENT
AND
HE
QUOTES
THE
PSALMS
IN
DOING
SO
MATT
THEN
I
WILL
TELL
THEM
PLAINLY
I
NEVER
KNEW
YOU
AWAY
FROM
ME
YOU
EVILDOERS
PS
IN
HEB
THE
APOSTLE
ATTRIBUTES
PS
DIRECTLY
TO
CHRIST
ALTHOUGH
NOWHERE
IN
THE
GOSPELS
IS
CHRIST
RECORDED
AS
HAVING
SAID
THESE
WORDS
SIMILARLY
HEBREWS
ATTRIBUTES
PS
DIRECTLY
TO
CHRIST
DESPITE
THERE
BEING
NO
RECORD
OF
HIS
HAVING
SPOKEN
THESE
WORDS
WHILE
ON

CLEARLY
THE
APOSTLES
BELIEVED
CHRIST
IS
SPEAKING
IN
THE
PSALMS
CHRIST
CAME
TO
ESTABLISH
HIS
KINGDOM
AND
TO
EXTEND
HIS
MERCY
IN
ALL
THE
EARTH
BUT
LET
US
NEVER
FORGET
THAT
JESUS
WILL
COME
AGAIN
TO
EXECUTE
JUDGEMENT
ON
THE
WICKED
DAVID
AS
THE
ANOINTED
KING
OF
THE
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
OF
GOD
WAS
A
PROTOTYPE
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
ACTS
BEING
THEREFORE
A
PROPHET
HE
FORESAW
AND
SPOKE
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
CHRIST
DAVID
WAS
A
WITNESS
TO
CHRIST
IN
HIS
OFFICE
IN
HIS
LITE
AND
IN
HIS
WORDS
THE
SAME
WORDS
WHICH
DAVID
SPOKE
THE
FUTURE
MESSIAH
SPOKE
THROUGH
HIM
THE
PRAYERS
OF
DAVID
WERE
PRAYED
ALSO
BY
CHRIST
OR
BETTER
CHRIST
HIMSELF
PRAYED
THESE
PSALMS
THROUGH
HIS
FORERUNNER
DAVID
THE
IMPRECATORY
PSALMS
ARE
EXPRESSIONS
OF
THE
INFINITE
JUSTICE
OF
GOD
OF
HIS
INDIGNATION
AGAINST
WRONG
DOING
AND
HIS
COMPASSION
FOR
THE
WRONGED
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PSALMS
OF
REPENTANCE
CHRIST
IS
ALSO
THE
LAMB
OF
GOD
THE
SUBSTITUTIONARY
SACRIFICE
FOR
OUR
SINS
CHRIST
IN
THE
DAY
OF
HIS
CRUCIFIXION
WAS
CHARGED
WITH
THE
SIN
OF

HE
APPROPRIATED
TO
HIMSELF
THOSE
DEBTS
FOR
WHICH
HE
HAD
MADE
HIMSELF
RESPONSIBLE
OUR
LORD
WAS
THE
SUBSTITUTION
FOR
THE

HE
TOOK
THE

PLACE
ISAIAH
GOD
MADE
HIM
WHO
HAD
NO

TO
BE
SIN
FOR

THAT
IN

SENT
SEVENTYTWO

TOLD

TO
PROCLAIM
THE
COMING
OF

LK
THAT
IS

ANNOUNCE
THAT

THEY
APPROACH
ASSURING
THEM
THAT
IF
ANYONE
REJECTED
IT
THE

WOULD

WE
MUST
CONSIDER
WHAT
HE
SAID

SHOULD
DO
IF
THEIR

WERE
REJECTED

IS
IF
THE

PERSISTED
IN
REBELLION

WHEN
YOU
ENTER
A

ARE
NOT
WELCOMED
GO
INTO

EVEN
THE

BEARABLE
ON
THAT

ON
WHICH
GOD
SENT

FOR
ITS

THAN
FOR

ON
ANYONE
HIS
PERSISTENT
REBELLION
AGAINST

AUTHORITY
EXPRESSED
IN

THE

WE
NEED
TO
CLEARLY

FORCEFULLY
PROCLAIM
THE

ONLY
THEN
WILL
THE

AWAKE
FROM

ONCE

ENTER
THE

A
