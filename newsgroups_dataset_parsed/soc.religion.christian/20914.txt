DELETION

PAULS
AND
AARONS
DISCOURSE
ON
ANGER
REF
GALATIANS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
IT
IS
SO
OBVIOUS
WE
ARE
NOT
SPEAKING
OF
ACTS
OF
THE
FLESH
WE
ARE
JUST
SPEAKING
OF
EMOTIONS
EMOTIONS
ARE
NOT
OF
THEMSELVES
MORAL
OR
IMMORAL
GOOD
OR
BAD
EMOTIONS
JUST
ARE
THE
FIRST
STEP
IS
NOT
TO
LABEL
HIS
EMOTION
AS
GOOD
OR
BAD
OR
TO
NUMB
OURSELVES
SO
THAT
WE
HIDE
OUR
TRUE
FEELINGS
IT
IS
TO
ACCEPT
OURSELVES
AS
WE
ARE
AS
GOD
ACCEPTS
US
OH
BUT
THEY
DEFINITELY
CAN
BE
PLEASE
LOOK
AT
COLOSSIANS
AND
EPHESIANS
EMOTIONS
CAN
BE
CONTROLLED
AND
GOD
PUTS
VERY
STRONG
EMPHASIS
ON
SELFCONTROL
OTHERWISE
WHY
WOULD
HE
HAVE
PAUL
WRITE
TO
TIMOTHY
SO
MUCH
ABOUT
MAKING
SURE
TO
TEACH
SELFCONTROL
INSERT

OF
REMAINDER
OF
PARAGRAPH
RETHINK
IT
AARON
DONT
BE
QUICK
TO
JUDGE
HE
HAS
FORGIVEN
THOSE
WITH
AIDS
HE
HAS
DEALT
WITH
AND
TAKEN
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
HIS
FEELINGS
AND
MADE
APPROPRIATE
CHOICES
FOR
ACTION
ON
SUCH
FEELINGS
HE
HAS
NOT
GIVEN
IN
TO
HIS
ANGER
PLEASE
RETHINK
AND
REREAD
FOR
YOURSELF
JOE
AGAIN
THE
ISSUE
IS
SELFCONTROL
ESPECIALLY
OVER
FEELINGS
AND
ACTIONS
FOR
OUR
ACTIONS
STEM
FROM
OUR
FEELINGS
IN
MANY
INSTANCES
AS
FOR
GOD
GIVING
IN
TO
HIS
ANGER
THAT
COMES
VERY
SOON
