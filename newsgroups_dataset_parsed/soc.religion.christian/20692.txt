OF

THEY
KNEW
WHERE
IT
WAS
DONT
FORGET
THAT
JESUS
WAS
SEEN
BY
BOTH
THE
JEWS
AND
THE
ROMANS
AS
A
TROUBLEMAKER
PILATE
WAS
NO
FOOL
AND
DIDNT
NEED
THE
ADDITIONAL
HEADACHES
OF
SOME
FISHERMEN
STEALING
JESUS
BODY
TO
MAKE
IT
APPEAR
HE
HAD
ARISEN
SINCE
JESUS
WAS
BURIED
IN
THE
GRAVE
OF
A
MAN
WELL
KNOW
TO
THE
SANHEDRIN
TO
SAY
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
WHERE
HE
WAS

BEGS
THE
QUESTION
HERE
AGAIN
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
MOST
OF
THE
INDIVIDUALS
POSTING
HERE
YOU
TAKE
THE
BIBLICAL
ACCOUNT
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
SOME
SORT
OF
HISTORICAL
RECOUNTING
IN
THE
MODERN
SENSE
I
WOULD
REFER
YOU
TO
JOHN
DOMINIC
CROSSANS
BOOK
THE
CROSS
THAT
SPOKE

HARPER
AND

THE
EARLIEST
TEXTS
WHICH
WE
HAVE
MAKE
NO
REFERENCE
TO
AN
EMPTY
TOMB
NOR
IS
AN
EMPTY
TOMB
NECESSARY
FOR
A
CLAIM
OF
RESURRECTION
MODERN
EVANGELICALSFUNDAMENTALISTS
HAVE
COMPLETELY
MISSED
WHAT
THE
POINT
OF
RESURRECTION
IS
HERE

WORK
OF

HERE

NO
NEED
OF
AN

ADDITIONALLY
IN

HERE
AGAIN
THERE
IS
NO
MENTION
OF
AN
EMPTY
TOMB
HE
WAS
RAISED
NOTE
THE
PASSIVE
HE
APPEARED
NO
ASCENSION
EITHER
RESURRECTION
COULD
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
WITHOUT
EVER
DISTURBING
THE
BONES
IN
THE
GRAVE
THE
WHOLE
IDEA
OF
AN
EMPTY
TOMB
ISNT
BROACHED
IN
ANY
OF
OUR
TEXTS
UNTIL
WELL
AFTER
THE
FALL
OF
JERUSALEM
BY
THAT
TIME
THE
IDEA
OF
COMING
UP
WITH
A
BODY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
LUDICRIOUS
MOREOVER
MACK
HAS
ARGUED
CONVICINGLY
I
THINK
THAT
THE
EMPTY
TOMB
STORY
FIRST
APPEARS
IN
MARK
WE
HAVE
NO
TEXTS
BEFORE
THIS
WHICH
MENTION
THE
TOMB
NOW
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
THINK
THAT
THE
DISCIPLES
STOLE
THE
BODY
BUT
THINK
ON
THIS
A
MOMENT
WOULD
YOU
DIE
TO
MAINTAIN
SOMETHING
YOU
KNEW
TO
BE
A
DELIBERATE
LIE
IF
NOT
THEN
WHY
DO
YOU
THINK
THE
DISCIPLES
WOULD
NOW
IM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
DYING
FOR
SOMETHING
YOU
FIRMLY
BELIEVE
TO
BE
THE
TRUTH
BUT
UNBEKNOWN
TO
YOU
IT
IS
A
LIE
MANY
HAVE
DONE
THIS
NO
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
DYING
BY
BEHEADING
STONING
CRUCIFIXION
ETC
FOR
SOMETHING
YOU
KNOW
TO
BE
A
LIE
THUS
YOU
POSITION
WITH
REGARDS
TO
THE
DISCIPLES
STEALING
THE
BODY
SEEMS
RATHER
LIGHTWEIGHT
TO
ME
AS
FOR
GRAVEROBBERS
WHY
RISK
THE
SEVERE
PENALTIES
FOR
GRAVE
ROBBING
OVER
THE
BODY
OF
JESUS
HE
WASNT
BURIED
WITH
GREAT
RICHES
SO
AGAIN
THIS
IS
AN
ARGUMENT
THAT
CAN
BE
DISCOUNTED
THAT
LEAVES
YOU
BACK
ON
SQUARE
ONE
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
THE
BODY
AGAIN
LET
ME
COMMENT
THAT
THE
MOST
PLAUSIBLE
NONCHRISTIAN
SCENARIO
AND
THE
ONE
TYPICALLY
SUGGESTED
BY
SCEPTICS
WHO
ARE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
ABOUT
THE
NT
IS
THAT
THE
RESURRECTION
WAS
A
SUBJECTIVE
EVENT
AND
THE
EMPTY
TOMB
STORIES
ARE
A
RESULT
OF
ACCOUNTS
GROWING
IN
THE
TELLING
CLH
YOU
ARE
QUITE
RIGHT
HERE
EVEN
THE
IDEA
OF
A
SUBJECTIVE
MYSTICAL
EVENT
AS
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
NARRATIVES
IS
CURRENTLY
BECOMING
