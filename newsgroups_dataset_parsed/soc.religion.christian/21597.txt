HOMOSEXUALITY

HEDRICKGENEVARUTGERSEDU
WRITES
THIS
CAME
FROM
HERES
HIS
RESPONSE
KINSEY
SEE
BELOW
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
FIGURE
PERCENT
THERE
WAS
AN
ARTICLE
IN
USA
TODAY
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
SHOWING
THE
RESULTS
OF
A
STUDY
THAT
ACTUALLY
ONLY
ABOUT
WERE
HOMOSEXUAL
I
SAW
ANOTHER
FIGURE
THAT
LISTED
AS
THE
FIGURE
OF
COURSE
EVEN
IF
IT
WERE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
LITTLE
BEARING
ON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
IS
A
SINFUL
BEHAVIOR
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
COMMITED
OTHER
ACTS
OF
FORNICATION
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
LIED
OR
SINNED
IN
OTHER
WAYS
BUT
IN
ALL
FAIRNESS
THE
SHAMELESS
NATURE
OF
THEIR
ACTS
IS
A
REFLECTION
OF
THE
GENERAL
SPIRITUAL
STATE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AND
NOT
A
SPECIFIC
FEATURE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
WHY
ISNT
IT
A
SPECIFIC
FEATURE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
PAUL
DESCRIBES
MEN
WITH
MEN
WORKING
THAT
WHICH
IS
UNSEEMLY
TO
DESCRIBE
THE
ACTS
SURE
THERE
SPIRTUAL
NATURE
WAS
DEPRAVED
ALSO
AND
LIKE
THE
OTHER
SINS
THE
IDOLATRY
THE
OTHER
SEXUAL
IMMORAITY
AND
THE
OTHER
SINS
SPRANG
FROM
THEIR
DEPRAVED
SPIRITUAL
STATE
WHICH
WAS
A
RESULT
OF
MANS
NOT
GLORIFYING
GOD
AS
GOD
AND
BEING
THANKFUL
STILL
THEIR
ACTS
WERE
SHAMELESS
HOMOSEXUALITY
OR
EVEN
CONSIDERED
IT
ACCEPTABLE
IN
SOME
CASES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
NONE
OF
THESE
PASSAGES
CONTAINS
EXPLICIT
TEACHINGS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
ROM
IS
REALLY
ABOUT
IDOLATRY
IT
REFERS
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
PASSING
IS
EVERYTHING
SINFUL
SPECIFICALLY
ELABORATED
ON
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
SCRIPTURE
DOES
NOT
CONDEMN
BEING
A
DRUG
DEALER
BEING
RULED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
RATHER
THAN
THE
LETTER
NOT
ONLY
FREES
FROM
LEGALISM
IT
ALSO
PROTECTS
US
FROM
SINS
THAT
ARE
AGAINST
THE
SPIRIT
THE
WORD
IS
A
TWO
EDGED
SWORD
THAT
CUTS
BOTH
WAYS
I
THINK
WE
MUST
BE
CAREFUL
BEFORE
WE
TOTALLY
THROW
OUT
LEVITICUS
IF
THE
LAW
IS
REFLECTION
OF
GODS
CHARACTER
AND
TRUE
HOLY
NATURE
THEN
THOSE
WHO
SAY
THAT
GOD
ENDORSES
HOMOSEXUALITY
RUN
INTO
A
PROBLEM
IF
HOMOSEXUALITY
WERE
NATURAL
WHATEVER
THAT
MEANS
WHOLESOME
ENDORSED
BY
GOD
AND
THOSE
WHO
OPPOSE
SEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
ARE
NARROWMINDED
BIGGOTS
AS
SOME
WOULD
HAVE
US
BELIEVE
WHY
IS
THERE
A
CONDEMNATION
OF
IT
IN
LEVITICUS
THIS
CONDEMNATION
IS
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
ALL
THE
OTHER
SEX
SIN
CONDEMNATIONS
AND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
THE
TEXT
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
LAW
WAS
LIMITED
TO
TEMPLE
PROSTITUTION
AND
NO
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
WAS
THE
CASE
FURTHERMORE
MALE
HOMOSEXUAL
SEX
WAS
A
DEATHPENALTY
CRIME
IS
EVERY
SIN
ELABORATED
ON
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
I
CORINTHIANS
PAUL
SAID
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
CORINTHIANS
HAD
BROKEN
A
LAW
NOT
EVEN
HEARD
OF
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
HAVE
HIS
FATHERS
WIFE
THERE
IS
A
PROHIBITION
AGAINST
HAVING
YOUR
FATHERS
WIFE
IN
LEVITICUS
NO
OTHER
NEW
TESTAMENT
VERSE
CLEARLY
CONDEMNS
IT
BESIDES
THIS
ONE
NOTICE
THAT
PAUL
DID
NOT
SAY
THAT
THE
SIN
WAS
IN
COMMITING
ADULTERY
ETC
HE
SPOKE
AGAINST
HAVING
ONES
FATHERS
WIFE
NOTICE
ALSO
THAT
THIS
SEXUAL
CONDEMNATION
IN
LEVITICUS
IS
NOT
MENTIONED
IN
THE
SPECIFIC
CONTEXT
OF
PAGANISM
EITHER
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
PAGAN
COUSTOM
MENTIONED
IN
I
CORINTHIANS
EITHER
AS
A
MATTER
OF
FACT
TAKING
ONES
FATHERS
WIFE
WASNT
EVEN
DONE
AMONG
THE
GENTILES
IT
WAS
JUST
A
PLAIN
BLANTANT
SIN
WHETHER
WORSHIPPING
IDOLS
WAS
INVOLVED
OR
NOT
ONE
COMMONLY
MADE
CLAIM
IS
THAT
PAUL
HAD
SIMPLY
NEVER
FACED
THE
KINDS
OF
QUESTIONS
WE
ARE
TRYING
TO
DEAL
WITH
HE
ENCOUNTERED
HOMOSEXUALITY
ONLY
IN
CONTEXTS
WHERE
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
PROBABLY
AGREE
THAT
IT
WAS
WRONG
HE
HAD
NEVER
FACED
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
WHO
TRY
TO
ACT
STRAIGHT
AND
FAIL
AND
HE
HAD
NEVER
FACED
CHRISTIANS
WHO
ARE
TRYING
TO
DEFINE
A
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
WHICH
FITS
WITH
GENERAL
CHRISTIAN
IDEALS
OF
FIDELITY
AND
OF
SEEING
SEXUALITY
AS
A
MIRROR
OF
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
GOD
AND
MAN
IT
IS
UNFAIR
TO
TAKE
PAULS
JUDGEMENT
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
AMONG
IDOLATERS
AND
USE
IT
TO
MAKE
JUDGEMENTS
ON
THESE
QUESTIONS
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
THAT
SOME
OF
US
DO
NOT
ACCEPT
THAT
COMMON
ARGUMENT
IS
BECAUSE
PAUL
PROBABLY
DID
FACE
THIS
AND
OTHER
PROBLEMS
SIN
CAN
BE
TOUGH
TO
OVER
COME
ESPECIALLY
WITHOUT
SUPERNATURAL
POWER
IS
HOMOSEXUAL
SIN
ANY
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
OVERCOME
THAT
HETEROSEXUAL
SIN
LIKE
LUSTING
AFTER
A
MARRIED
WOMAN
OR
SLEEPING
AROUND
WITH
PEOPLE
OF
THE
OPPOSITE
SEX
I
DOUBT
IT
AND
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
THAT
IS
NO
EXCUSE
GOD
IS
GREATER
THAN
ALL
OF
IT
ANOTHER
REASON
WE
REJECT
IT
IS
BECAUSE
IT
IGNORES
THE
SUPERNATURAL
POWER
OF
GOD
TO
INTERVENE
IN
THIS
KIND
OF
SITUATION
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
SET
FREE
FROM
SIN
BY
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
SURE
THERE
MAY
BE
ANY
GROUPS
THAT
HAVE
TRIED
TO
CHANGE
HOMOSEXUALS
AND
FAILED
THAT
IS
A
REFLECTION
ON
THE
PEOPLE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PROGRAM
AND
NOT
GODS
WILLINGNESS
AND
ABILITY
TO
CHANGE
A
SINNER
ANY
PROGRAM
THAT
USES
FORMULAS
MAY
FAIL
WHAT
PEOPLE
NEED
IS
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
TO
CHANGE
THEM
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
HOMOSEXUAL
SIN
OR
ANY
OTHER
SIN
I
CLAIM
THAT
THE
QUESTION
OF
HOW
TO
COUNSEL
HOMOSEXUAL
CHRISTIANS
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
A
THEOLOGICAL
ISSUE
BUT
ALSO
A
PASTORAL
ONE
PAULS
TENDENCY
AS
WE
CAN
SEE
IN
ISSUES
SUCH
AS
EATING
MEAT
AND
CELEBRATING
HOLIDAYS
IS
TO
BE
UNCOMPROMISING
ON
PRINCIPLE
BUT
IN
PASTORAL
ISSUES
TO
LOOK
VERY
CAREFULLY
AT
THE
GOOD
OF
THE
PEOPLE
INVOLVED
AND
TO
AVOID
INSISTING
ON
PERFECTION
WHEN
IT
WOULD
BE
PERSONALLY
DAMAGING
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHILE
PAUL
CLEARLY
BELIEVED
THAT
IT
WAS
ACCEPTABLE
TO
EAT
MEAT
HE
WANTED
US
TO
AVOID
PUSHING
PEOPLE
INTO
DOING
AN
ACTION
ABOUT
WHICH
THEY
HAD
PERSONAL
QUALMS
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
YOU
COME
TO
THAT
CONCLUSION
PAULS
DEALINGS
WITH
PASTORIAL
ISSUES
ENCOURAGED
PEOPLE
TO
GIVE
UP
THEIR
LIBERTIES
IN
ORDER
TO
SPARE
OTHERS
NOT
TO
ALLOW
PEOPLE
TO
CONTINUE
IN
SIN
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
JUST
TOO
DIFFICULT
TAKE
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
EATING
MEAT
OFFERED
TO
IDOLS
PAUL
FELT
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
WRONG
IN
AN
ABSTRACT
SENSE
WITH
EATING
THE
MEAT
YET
HE
ADVISED
BELIEVERS
TO
SACRIFICE
THEIR
LIBERTY
TO
EAT
MEAT
IN
ORDER
TO
SPARE
OTHERS
BUT
PAUL
NEVER
ALLOWED
PEOPLE
TO
SIN
BECAUSE
LIVING
HOLY
WAS
JUST
TO
TOUGH
PAUL
WROTE
TO
MAKE
NO
PROVISION
FOR
THE
FLESH
TO
FULFILL
THE
LUSTS
THEREOF
ROMANS
THEN
HE
GOES
IN
TO
A
DISCOURSE
ON
HOW
WE
SHOULD
SACRIFICE
OUR
OWN
LIBERTY
IN
ORDER
TO
SPARE
THE
CONSCIENCES
OF
OTHERS
SUPPOSE
IT
WERE
NOT
A
SIN
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
PRACTICE
HOMOSEXUAL
ACTS
SINCE
OTHERS
CONSIDER
IT
TO
BE
A
SIN
THEN
USING
PAULS
APPROACH
ON
PASTORIAL
ISSUES
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
OTHERWISE
BE
HOMOSEXUALS
SHOULD
SACRIFICE
THEIR
LIBERTY
AND
BE
CELBATE
OR
MONOGAMOUSLY
MARRIED
TO
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
OPPOSITE
SEX
PAUL
NEVER
OFFERS
A
LESSER
SIN
HOMOSEXUAL
MARRIAGE
TO
PREVENT
PEOPLE
FROM
ENGAGING
IN
WHAT
MAY
BE
CONSIDERED
A
MORE
DAMAGING
SIN
FOR
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
PAUL
OBVIOUSLY
WOULD
HAVE
PREFERRED
TO
SEE
PEOPLE
AT
LEAST
IN
SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES
REMAIN
UNMARRIED
YET
IF
THEY
WERE
UNABLE
TO
DO
SO
HE
CERTAINLY
WOULD
RATHER
SEE
THEM
MARRIED
THAN
IN
A
STATE
WHERE
THEY
MIGHT
BE
TEMPTED
TO
FORNICATION
YET
MARRIAGE
ITSELF
IS
NOT
A
SIN
MARRIAGE
IS
HOLY
IN
ALL
AND
SOMETHING
THAT
GOD
ORDAINS
AND
PAUL
RECOGNIZES
THIS
NOTE
THAT
IN
THE
CREATION
STORY
WORK
ENTERS
HUMAN
LIFE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SIN
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
CHRISTIANS
CAN
STOP
WORKING
WHEN
WE
ARE
SAVED
ACTUALLY
ADAM
WAS
PUT
IN
THE
GARDEN
TO
TEND
TO
IT
BEFORE
HE
FELL
AFTER
HE
FELL
HE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
TOIL
OVER
THE
GROUND
THE
DANGERS
OF
TRYING
TO
CURE
IT
ARE
THAT
THE
ATTEMPT
MOST
OFTEN
FAILS
AND
WHEN
IT
DOES
YOU
END
UP
WITH
DAMAGE
RANGING
FROM
PSYCHOLOGICAL
DAMAGE
TO
SUICIDE
AS
WELL
AS
BROKEN
MARRIAGES
WHEN
ATTEMPTS
AT
LIVING
AS
A
HETEROSEXUAL
FAIL
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
ARE
DEPENDENT
TOTALLY
ON
GOD
WHAT
A
VUNERABLE
AND
GLORIOUS
POSITION
TO
BE
IT
WE
ALL
MUST
BE
TRANSFORMED
BY
THE
RENEWING
OF
OUR
MINDS
AND
THAT
IS
THE
ONLY
WAY
HOMOSEXUALS
CAN
WALK
IN
FREEDOM
JUST
LIKE
ANYONE
ELSE
BUT
I
CAN
WELL
IMAGINE
PAUL
PREFERRING
TO
SEE
PEOPLE
IN
LONGTERM
COMMITTED
CHRISTIAN
RELATIONSHIPS
THAN
PROMISCUITY
AS
WITH
WORK
WHICH
GENESIS
SUGGESTS
WASNT
PART
OF
GODS
ORIGINAL
IDEAL
EITHER
I
THINK
SUCH
RELATIONSHIPS
CAN
STILL
BE
A
VEHICLE
FOR
PEOPLE
SHARING
GODS
LOVE
WITH
EACH
OTHER
IM
SURE
YOU
CAN
SEE
HOW
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
OPPOSING
VIEW
SEE
THIS
CONCLUSION
ITS
LIKE
SAYING
HOW
SHOULD
I
KILL
MYSELF
WITH
GUN
OR
ARESENIC
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PERSON
WHO
JUST
IS
OVERCOME
WITH
A
DESIRE
TO
SLEEP
WITH
GOATS
WOULD
IT
BE
BETTER
FOR
HIM
TO
SLEEP
WITH
ONE
GOAT
OR
ALL
OF
THEM
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PERSON
WHO
WANTS
TO
SLEEP
WITH
HIS
AUNTS
WOULD
IT
BE
BETTER
FOR
HIM
TO
SLEEP
WITH
ONE
AUNT
OR
ALL
OF
THEM
IN
ALL
THESE
CASES
THE
MORE
PEOPLE
OR
ANIMALS
ONE
SLEEPS
WITH
THE
HIGHER
THE
CHANCE
THAT
THEY
WILL
GET
A
DISEASE
BUT
THIS
ONLY
DEALS
WITH
PHYSICAL
ASPECTS
OF
THE
QUESTION
WHICHEVER
SIN
IS
COMMITED
IT
ALL
LEADS
TO
SPIRITUAL
DEATH
CENT
ACTIONS
ARE
THE
SAME
WHEN
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALS
SAY
THAT
THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE
DIFFERENT
THAN
THE
GREEK
HOMOSEXUALITY
THAT
PAUL
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
FAMILIAR
WITH
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
ARGUMENT
THAT
IS
BEING
MADE
ABOUT
JUDICIAL
OATHS
AND
TAX
COLLECTORS
THE
ISSUE
THAT
IS
MOST
OFTEN
ADDRESSED
IN
SCRIPTURE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
ACTUAL
ACT
SECOND
ISNT
IT
HISTORICAL
SNOBBERY
TO
SAY
THAT
ONLY
HOMOSEXUALS
OF
THIS
CENTURY
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
HAVING
LOVING
RELATIONSHIPS
THERE
ARE
ANCIENT
WRITINGS
GLORIFYING
HOMOSEXUAL
LOVE
BTW
I
AM
ONE
WHO
BELIEVES
IN
REFRAINING
FROM
MAKING
OATHES
ALSO
WHERE
DO
YOU
GET
THAT
TAX
COLLECTORS
ARE
SINNERS
THATS
CERTAINLY
NOT
EXPLICIT
JESUS
DIDNT
TELL
ZACHIAS
TO
QUIT
HIS
JOB
LINK
HUDSON
IM
RELUCTANT
TO
COMMENT
IN
THIS
IN
DETAIL
OUR
BASIC
CONCEPTS
OF
THE
INTENTION
OF
JESUS
AND
PAUL
ARE
GREATLY
DIFFERENT
AS
I
INDICATED
IN
THE
ARTICLE
WHATEVER
THE
AMBIGUITIES
OF
VARIOUS
WORDS
AND
I
STILL
THINK
THEY
ARE
SIGNIFICANT
IT
DOES
SEEM
CLEAR
THAT
PAUL
CONSIDERED
THE
HOMOSEXUALITY
HE
SAW
AROUND
HIM
WRONG
WHAT
YOU
DO
WITH
THIS
FACT
DEPENDS
UPON
YOUR
BASIC
APPROACH
TO
THE
BIBLE
IM
AFRAID
THAT
COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN
LEGALIST
AND
ANTILEGALIST
CHRISTIANS
IS
EVEN
HARDER
THAN
BETWEEN
PROTESTANTS
AND
CATHOLICS
IN
THE
CENT
SINCE
YOU
DISAGREE
WITH
MY
STARTING
POINT
OBVIOUSLY
YOURE
GOING
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
INTERMEDIATE
DISCUSSION
AND
CONCLUSIONS
SOMETIMES
DISCUSSION
IS
STILL
USEFUL
IVE
SEEN
SOME
VERY
INTERESTING
WORK
ON
PAUL
DONE
BY
JEWS
OBVIOUSLY
THEY
DONT
AGREE
WITH
HIM
BUT
THEY
SOMETIMES
HAVE
HELPFUL
INSIGHT
INTO
WHAT
HE
MEANT
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
MUCH
SIGN
FOR
HOPE
HERE
IN
TALKRELIGIONMISC
THERES
AN
AXIOM
THAT
BY
THE
TIME
HITLERS
NAME
IS
INVOKED
ALL
HOPE
FOR
SENSIBLE
DISCUSSION
IS
GONE
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
WHEN
SLEEPING
WITH
GOATS
IS
INVOKED
I
DONT
THINK
THERES
ENOUGH
BASIS
FOR
UNDERSTANDING
TO
BE
WORTH
PURSUING
