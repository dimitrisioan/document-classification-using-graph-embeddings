WHITSELL
WRITES
I
SEE
NO
OTHER
WAY
OF
INTERPRETING
THEM
OTHER
THAN
HOMOSEXUYALITY
BEING
WRONG
PLEASE
TELL
ME
HOW
THESE
VERSES
CAN
BE
INTERPRETED
IN
ANY
OTHER
WAY
I
READ
THEM
AND
THE
SURROUNDING
TEXT
BUT
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
WAS
ASKING
IF
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
COMMUNITY
IS
THAT
THE
PROPER
TERM
HAS
DECIDED
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOT
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOUR
BUT
RATHER
CONDONES
IT
THEN
HOW
DO
THEY
INTERPRET
THESE
VERSES
I
GUESS
WHAT
I
AM
REALLY
LOOKING
FOR
IS
A
HOMOSEXUAL
RESPONSE
