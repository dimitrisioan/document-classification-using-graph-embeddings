SOME
QUESTIONS
FROM
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
REPLYTO
PWHITEEMPROSCOM
IN

STEVEN
R
HOSKINS
WRITES
I
HAVE
ANOTHER
QUESTION
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
I
AM
NOT
YET
AFFILIATED
WITH
ANY
ONE
CONGREGATION
ASIDE
FROM
MATTERS
OF
TASTE
WHAT
CRITERIA
SHOULD
ONE
USE
IN
CHOOSING
A
CHURCH
I
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
VARIOUS
PROTESTANT
DENOMINATIONS
HERE
IN
AMERICA
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
THINK
OF
CHOOSING
A
CHURCH
MUCH
LIKE
THEY
THINK
OF
CHOOSING
A
CAR
OR
A
COUNTRY
CLUB
WHAT
I
MEAN
IS
THAT
OUR
CULTURE
IS
SUCH
THAT
WE
TEND
TOWARDS
SATISFYING
OUR
OWN
WANTS
RATHER
THAN
CONSIDERING
THINGS
WITH
OTHERS
IN
MIND
AND
NOT
MAKING
PRAYER
AN
INITIAL
AND
PRIMARY
PART
OF
THE
DECISION
PROCESS
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
TREAT
CHURCH
AS
THEY
WOULD
A
CLUB
AND
WHEN
SOMETHING
IS
LESS
THAN
TO
THEIR
LIKING
OFF
THEY
GO
TO
ANOTHER
ONE
I
THINK
THAT
SCRIPTURE
PRESENTS
THE
IDEA
THAT
GOD
TAKES
A
DIFFERENT
PERSPECTIVE
ON
THE
CHURCH
CHOOSING
PROCESS
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
FROM
THAT
GOD
DOESNT
SUBSCRIBE
TO
THE
IDEA
OF
US
CHOOSING
A
CHURCH
AT
ALL
BUT
THAT
HE
PLACES
US
IN
THE
BODY
AS
HE
WANTS
US
SO
I
THINK
A
BETTER
QUESTION
IS
NOT
HOW
DO
I
CHOOSE
A
CHURCH
BUT
HOW
DO
I
FIGURE
OUT
WHERE
GOD
IS
TRYING
TO
PLACE
ME
IF
A
PERSON
WAS
INSTRUMENTAL
IN
LEADING
YOU
TO
CHRIST
THE
CHURCH
THEY
GO
TO
IS
A
LOGICAL
FIRST
CHOICE
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
BORN
INTO
THE
FAMILY
OF
GOD
PEOPLE
SHOULD
HOP
AROUND
FROM
CHURCH
TO
CHURCH
AS
OFTEN
AS
THEY
HOP
FROM
NATURAL
FAMILY
TO
FAMILY
IF
YOU
MET
THE
LORD
ON
YOUR
OWN
SO
TO
SPEAK
THERE
MAY
NOT
BE
AN
EASILY
IDENTIFIABLE
CHURCH
TO
TRY
FOR
STARTERS
HERE
YOU
ARE
MORE
LIKE
AN
ORPHAN
PRAYERFULLY
GO
AND
LEAVE
YOURSELF
ON
A
FEW
DOORSTEPS
AND
SEE
IF
ANYPLACE
FEELS
LIKE
HOME
I
WOULDNT
EXPECT
THAT
GOD
WANT
TO
PLACE
YOU
IN
A
CHURCH
WHERE
YOU
HAVE
DIFFICULTY
FITTING
IN
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
BUT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THERE
ARE
NO
PERFECT
CHURCHES
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
ATTITUDE
OF
LOOKING
FOR
PROBLEMS
YOU
WILL
BOTH
FIND
THEM
AND
MAKE
THEM
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
ATTITUDE
OF
LOVE
AND
COMMITTMENT
YOU
WILL
SPREAD
THAT
WHEREVER
YOU
GO
IN
GENERAL
I
THINK
THAT
GOD
WILL
TRY
TO
PLACE
YOU
IN
A
CHURCH
THAT
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
LORD
IN
THE
WAY
THAT
YOU
HAVE
COME
TO
KNOW
HIM
AND
IS
EXPANDING
ON
THAT
BASE
PETER
WHITE
DISCLAIMER
NONE
OF
WHAT
IS
WRITTEN
NECESSARILY
REFLECTS
A
VIEW
OF
MY
COMPANY
PHIL
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
CHRIST
AND
THE
POWER
OF
HIS
RESURRECTION
AND
THE
FELLOWSHIP
OF
SHARING
IN
NIV
HIS
SUFFERINGS
BECOMING
LIKE
HIM
IN
HIS
DEATH
