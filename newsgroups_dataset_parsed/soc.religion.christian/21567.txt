I
AM
UNABLE
TO
POST
TO
THE
BITNET
GROUPS
HERE
IS
A
CAPSULE
HISTORY
OF
THE
SHEPHERDINGDISCIPLESHIP
MOVEMENT
IN
THE
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
IE
CROSSROADSBOSTON
I
COULD
TRACE
THE
MOVEMENT
BACK
AS
FAR
AS
AND
INDEED
SOME
OF
ITS
ROOTS
GO
BACK
THAT
FAR
BUT
THESE
WERE
REALLY
INFLUENCES
ON
THE
MOVEMENT
AND
NOT
THE
ACTUAL
MOVEMENT
PER
SE
I
WILL
START
IN
IN
THAT
DAY
THERE
WERE
WHITE
CHURCHES
AND
COLORED
CHURCHES
IN
NEARLY
EVERY
AREA
DUE
TO
SEGREGATION
MODERN
PENTECOSTALISM
WAS
DEVELOPING
AS
A
PREDOMINANTLY
COLORED
PHENOMENON
HERE
THERE
WAS
GREAT
FANATICISM
EMPHASIS
ON
EMOTIONAL
EXPERIENCES
AND
BELIEF
IN
A
PERSONAL
GUIDANCE
AND
INDWELLING
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
MANY
WHITE
PROTESTANT
CHURCHES
WERE
GROWING
INTO
WHAT
BECAME
KNOWN
AS
CONSERVATIVE
FUNDAMENTALISM
BY
THE
THE
EVANGELICAL
MOVEMENT
WAS
IN
FULL
SWING
AND
MANY
GROUPS
WERE
BECOMING
PART
OF
IT
WHEN
THE
CIVIL
RIGHTS
MOVEMENT
GREW
STRONGER
IN
THE
AND
MANY
WHITE
CHURCH
GROUPS
BEGAN
TO
BE
INFLUENCED
BY
THE
BLACK
CHURCHES
AND
BY
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
THERE
THIS
SPREAD
STARTED
IN
THE
MOST
LIBERAL
OF
GROUPS
AND
SPREAD
TO
THE
MORE
CONSERVATIVE
ONES
BY
THE
LATE
IN
EVEN
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
WAS
DISPLAYING
EVIDENCE
OF
INFLUENCE
BY
THE
OTHER
GROUPSSTILL
EVIDENT
TODAY
THE
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
ARE
AND
WERE
A
VERY
CONSERVATIVE
PROTESTANT
GROUP
WHEN
THE
INFLUENCE
FROM
OUTSIDE
BEGAN
TO
REACH
THE
COFC
IN
IT
WAS
GENERALLY
NOT
APPRECIATED
CONSERVATIVE
GROUPS
ARE
VERY
STRONGLY
RESISTANT
TO
CHANGE
AND
THE
NEW
MOVEMENT
WAS
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
COFC
STATUS
QUO
THE
MAGAZINES
PUT
OUT
AT
THAT
TIME
BY
COFC
FOLKS
TELL
THE
STORY
AS
IT
UNFOLDS
NEW
IDEAS
CAME
INTO
THE
COFC
THERE
WAS
A
BIG
PUSH
TO
REACH
OUT
TO
COLLEGE
STUDENTS
YOUNG
ADULTS
AND
TEENS
SOME
CALLED
THIS
THE
CAMPUS
EVANGEL
ISM
MOVEMENT
EMOTIONS
GENERALLY
NOT
HIGHLY
REGARDED
IN
THE
COFC
AT
LARGE
PLAYED
A
MORE
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
THE
NEW
MOVEMENT
IN
SOME
PLACES
PEOPLE
BEGAN
TO
SPEAK
IN
TONGUES
AS
THEIR
PENTECOSTAL
PREDECESSORS
DID
THIS
WAS
MET
WITH
EXTREME
CRITICISM
FROM
WITHIN
THE
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
IN
SOME
PLACES
PEOPLE
WERE
FIRED
FROM
THEIR
JOBS
FOR
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
OR
FOR
ADVOCATING
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
MOVEMENT
ANOTHER
NAME
FOR
THE
NEW
BRANCH
THE
TERM
UNDERGROUND
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
ALSO
CAME
INTO
USE
BECAUSE
THESE
PEOPLE
HAD
TO
HIDE
THEIR
DIFFERENCES
OR
THEY
MIGHT
BE
OSTRICISED
THERE
WERE
SEVERAL
CONGREGATIONS
HOWEVER
WHOSE
LEADERSHIPS
WERE
RECEPTIVE
TO
THE
NEW
IDEAS
AT
LEAST
IN
PART
THE
TONGUESSPEAKING
NEVER
REALLY
CAUGHT
ON
ONE
OF
THESE
WAS
THE
STREET
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
IN
GAINESVILLE
FL
CAMPUS
MINISTRY
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
REGARDED
AS
IMPORTANT
AT
STREET
AND
THE
NEW
IDEAS
SEEMED
TO
BE
VERY
HELPFUL
TOOLS
FOR
EVANGELISM
THEY
ALSO
SEEMED
TO
PUT
VITALITY
INTO
THE
CHURCH
WHICH
MANY
FELT
HAD
BEEN
LACKING
IN
OCTOBER
OF
THE
STREET
CONGREGATION
HIRED
CHUCK
LUCAS
TO
BE
ITS
CAMPUS
MINISTER
BY
HE
WOULD
MOVE
TO
BEING
THE
CONGREGATIONS
LEAD
MINISTER
IN
THE
LATE
THE
CONGREGATION
WORKED
WITH
MANY
OTHER
GROUPS
THEY
HELD
BIBLE
DISCUSSIONS
AT
DAYTONA
BEACH
DURING
SPRING
BREAK
THEY
ORGANIZED
TALKS
IN
THE
FRATERNITIES
ON
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
FLORIDA
CAMPUS
THEY
ALSO
WORKED
WITH
UF
SPORTS
PEOPLE
IN
THE
CONGREGATION
ORDERED
A
LARGER
BUILDING
TO
BE
CONSTRUCTED
WHEN
IT
WAS
FINISHED
THE
GROUP
MOVED
AND
CHANGED
ITS
NAME
NOW
NO
LONGER
APPROPRIATE
IT
BECAME
THE
CROSSROADS
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
FROM
THEN
ON
A
NAME
THAT
WOULD
BECOME
LEGENDARY
BY
THIS
TIME
CROSSROADS
WAS
BASICALLY
THE
ONLY
COFC
WHOSE
PROGRAMS
WERE
FULLY
ALIGNED
TO
THE
NEW
MOVEMENT
WHILE
THEY
DIDNT
START
IT
THEY
CONTINUED
IT
AND
WERE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
WHERE
IT
WOUND
UP
GOING
BY
NONE
OF
THE
OTHER
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
IN
THE
AREA
FELT
THAT
THEY
COULD
COOPERATE
WITH
CROSSROADS
DUE
TO
WHAT
THEY
RECOGNIZED
AS
DOCTRINAL
PROBLEMS
AT
CROSSROADS
CROSSROADS
HAD
BEGUN
TO
HEAVILY
EMPHASIZE
AND
LATER
REQUIRE
ATTENDANCE
AT
ALL
CHURCH
FUNCTIONS
IT
WAS
SEEN
AS
A
GOOD
THING
FOR
EACH
MEMBER
TO
HAVE
AT
LEAST
ONE
CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP
A
PERSON
WITH
WHOM
YOU
WOULD
SHARE
ALL
OF
YOUR
PROBLEMS
PRAY
AND
GET
HELP
FROM
THE
CONCEPT
WAS
CALLED
PRAYER
PARTNERS
WHICH
LATER
BECAME
DISCIPLESHIP
PARTNERS
AND
ALSO
LATER
BECAME
MANDATORY
THE
LEADERSHIP
WAS
ASSIGNING
PRAYER
PARTNERS
TO
PEOPLE
FOR
A
WHILE
THE
BOOK
CALLED
THE
MASTER
PLAN
OF
EVANGELISM
WAS
A
STRONG
INFLUENCE
ON
CHUCK
LUCAS
HE
AND
THE
GROUP
BELIEVED
THAT
IT
WAS
EVERY
PERSONS
DUTY
AND
LIFE
PURPOSE
TO
CARRY
OUT
THE
GREAT
COMMISSION
CROSSROADS
WAS
GROWING
IN
NUMBER
AND
NUMBERS
BECAME
VERY
IMPORTANT
SOME
WOULD
SAY
ALLIMPORTANT
A
PERSON
WHO
WAS
EVANGELISTIC
WAS
SPIRITUAL
EVANGELISM
MEANT
INVITING
PEOPLE
TO
CROSSROADS
EVENTS
IF
YOU
DID
THIS
A
LOT
AND
SOME
OF
THEM
CONVERTED
THEN
YOU
WERE
SPIRITUAL
THERE
WERE
SERMONS
ABOUT
HOW
IF
YOU
BOUGHT
GROCERIES
THE
CASHIER
AND
BAG
BOY
OUGHT
TO
RECEIVE
INVITATIONS
TO
SERVICES
EVERYONE
AT
YOUR
JOB
OUGHT
TO
RECEIVE
INVITATIONS
SINCE
THESE
PEOPLE
NEEDED
JESUS
YOU
SHOULD
BE
AGGRESSIVEDONT
TAKE
NO
FOR
AN
ANSWER
IF
YOU
DID
NOT
EVANGELIZE
ENOUGH
YOU
CAME
TO
BE
CALLED
LAZY
OR
UNSPIRITUAL
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
DECADE
THE
PRAYER
PARTNER
SYSTEM
WAS
INTEGRATED
INTO
A
STRUCTURE
THE
ELDERS
AND
MINISTERS
WERE
ON
TOP
LIKE
A
BIG
PYRAMID
THEN
THE
GROUP
LEADERS
BIBLE
STUDY
LEADERS
AND
MEMBERS
EVERYONE
WHO
CAME
IN
HAD
SOMEONE
PLACED
OVER
THEM
IT
IS
AT
THIS
TIME
THAT
THE
BAD
PRESS
ABOUT
CROSSROADS
BEGAN
TO
CIRCULATE
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
RAPE
ON
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
FLORIDA
CAMPUS
WAS
TREMENDOUS
BUT
CROSSROADS
WAS
CONSIDERED
A
BIGGER
AND
MORE
IMMEDIATE
PROBLEM
THERE
WERE
MANY
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
THE
CONGREGATION
AND
ITS
PUSHY
EVANGELISTIC
TACTICS
CROSSROADS
WAS
CONSIDERING
THE
OTHER
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
TO
BE
DEAD
CHURCHES
WHICH
AGGRAVATED
THEM
IT
WAS
AGGRESSIVELY
RECRUITING
OUT
OF
THE
OTHER
CHURCH
GROUPS
DENOMINATIONS
WHICH
AGGRAVATED
THEM
BY
THIS
TIME
CROSSROADS
HAD
GROWN
NUMERICALLY
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
NOT
ONLY
DID
THEY
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
SOON
NEED
A
NEW
BUILDING
BUT
ALSO
THEY
WERE
SENDING
OUT
PLANTING
CREATE
A
NEW
CHURCH
AND
RECONSTRUCTING
REORGANIZE
AN
EXISTING
CHURCH
TEAMS
TO
OTHER
CITIES
BY
THIS
TIME
THE
CROSSROADS
MOVEMENT
WAS
UNDERWAY
A
GROUP
WAS
SENT
TO
THE
LEXINGTON
CHURCH
OF
CHRIST
IN
BOSTON
MA
THE
TEAM
WAS
HEADED
UP
BY
KIP
MCKEAN
WHO
HAD
BEEN
CONVERTED
OUT
OF
A
FRATERNITY
BY
CROSSROADS
IN
GAINESVILLE
KIP
HELD
A
STILL
STRONGER
VIEW
OF
CHURCH
AUTHORITY
WHICH
HE
BELIEVED
WAS
HEAVILY
VESTED
IN
THE
EVANGELISTS
AND
NOT
SO
MUCH
IN
THE
ELDERS
HE
HAD
BEEN
FIRED
IN
FROM
THE
CONGREGATION
THAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
WORKING
AT
WHEN
THE
ELDERS
THERE
FOUND
NUMEROUS
THINGS
WRONG
WITH
HIS
THEOLOGY
INCLUDING
THE
PRACTICE
OF
WHAT
CAME
TO
BE
CALLED
ONEOVER
ONE
CHRISTIANITY
CALLED
THIS
BY
CRITICS
IN
THE
FIRST

HALF
OF
THE
PEOPLE

THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
BE
A
PART
OF
THE
NEW
CONGREGATION
THEY
LEFT
BUT
OTHERS
BEGAN
COMING
INTO
THE
NEW
BOSTON
CHURCH
OF

AH
BUT
IM
AHEAD
OF
MYSELF
AT
CROSSROADS
THE
HEAVYHANDED
SYSTEM
HAD
BEGUN
TO
TAKE
ITS
TOLL
ON
THE
MEMBERS
MANY
HAVE
SAID
THAT
THEY
FELT
THAT
THEY
WERE
WORKING
HARD
BUT
THEY
WERE
NOT
ACHIEVING
THE
RESULTS
THAT
WERE
SO
IMPORTANT
THE
NUMBERS
WERE
DROPPING
FROM
CROSSROADS
MEMBERSHIP
DECLINED
STEADILY
THE
LEADERSHIP
BEGAN
TO
TIGHTEN
THE
REIGNS
ON
THE
CONGREGATION
WHO
WAS
SEEN
AS
BEING
LARGELY
UNPRODUCTIVE
AND
UNFRUITFUL
THE
FRUIT
PASSAGES
IN
THE
NT
WERE
INTERPRETED
AS
REFERRING
TO
NEW
CONVERTS
IF
YOU
WERE
NOT
BEARING
FRUIT
SAID
JOHN
YOU
WOULD
BE
CAST
INTO
THE
FIRE
BOSTON
STILL
TEACHES
THIS
IF
YOU
LOVE
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
YOULL
SAVE
HIS
SOUL
INVITE
HIM
TO
CHURCH
AND
CONVERT
HIM
IF
YOURE
NOT
DOING
THAT
YOU
DONT
LOVE
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
AND
IF
YOU
DONT

YOURE
IN
DANGER
OF
BACKSLIDING

VEIN
IN
CHUCK
LUCAS
WAS
FIRED
FROM
HIS
JOB
AS
MINISTER
DUE
TO
RECURRING
SINS
IN
HIS
LIFE
THESE
STRUGGLES
WERE
NEVER
REVEALED
TO
THE
CONGREGATION
AT
LARGE
ALTHOUGH
MANY
PEOPLE
OUTSIDE
THE
CONGREGATION
HAD
HEARD
ABOUT
THEM
FOR
BY
NOW
THERE
WAS
VERY
LITTLE
CONTACT
ON
A
FRIENDSHIP
LEVEL
BETWEEN
MOST
CROSSROADS
MEMBERS
AND
THOSE
OUTSIDE
IF
YOU
HAVE
CONTACT
YOUR
FOCUS
SHOULD
BE
ON
CONVERTING

BRING
THEM
TO

CHUCKS
REPLACEMENT
WAS

WHO
WAS
FULLY
SUPPORTIVE
OF
THE

GREW
IN

THEY
BEGAN
TO

FOR

TO

TO
BE
TRAINED
AND
RETURNED
TO
CROSS

READY
TO
EMPHASIZE
THE
TOTAL
COMMITMENT
TO
THE
CHURCH
THAT
BOSTON
AND

MCKEAN
WERE
NOW
EMPHASIZING
EVENTUALLY
IN
FALL
OF
THE
ELDERS
AT
CROSSROADS
NOW
IN
NUMBERDICK
WHITEHEAD
AND
BILL
HOGLE
MADE
A
DECISION
BOSTON
WAS
DEMANDING
THAT
ALL
OF
THE
OTHER
CHURCHES
IN
THE
MOVEMENT
COME
UNDER
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
CHURCH
IN
BOSTON
THE
ELDERS
REFUSED
CITING
THEIR
BELIEF
THAT
EACH
CHURCH
SHOULD
BE
AUTONOMOUS
SOMETHING
TRUE
IN
ALL
NONBOSTON
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
PERHAPS
THERE
WAS
ALSO
SOME
DEGREE
OF
OFFENSE
DONE
HERE
SINCE
CROSSROADS
WAS
NO
LONGER
THE
EXAMPLE
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
MOVEMENT
THE
GROUP
NOW
NUMBERED
ABOUT
WHILE
BOSTON
WAS
NOW
LARGER
IN
MEMBERSHIP
THE
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
GENERALLY
TEACH
THAT
BAPTISM
IS
A
NECESSARY
ELEMENT
OF
SALVATION
AT
CROSSROADS
THEY
TAUGHT
WHAT
WAS
CALLED
LORDSHIP
BAPTISM
YOU
HAD
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
COMMITMENT
INVOLVED
BEFORE
YOU
COULD
BE
BAPTIZED
YOU
HAD
TO
COUNT
THE
COST
AT
BOSTON
THEY
TOOK
THIS
A
STEP
FURTHER
IF
AT
SOME
TIME
YOU
BECAME
UNPRODUCTIVE
THEN
YOUR
SPIRITUALITY
WAS
SUSPECT
PEOPLE
WOULD
BEGIN
TO
ASK
YOU
IF
YOU
REALLY
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
YOU
WERE
GETTING
INTO
ANYONE
WHO
SAID
NO
HAD
THEIR
BAPTISM
DEEMED
INVALID
THEY
HADNT
COUNTED
THE
COST
PROPERLY
THEY
STILL
HAD
TO
BE
BAPTIZED
OTHERS
CALLED
THIS
REBAPTISM
AND
CROSSROADS
DIDNT
APPROVE
OF
THIS
PRACTICE
WHEN
CROSSROADS
ANNOUNCED
THAT
IT
WOULD
NOT
FOLLOW
BOSTON
MANY
OF
ITS
MEMBERS
LEFT
CROSSROADS
AND
WENT
TO
MOVEMENTRELATED
MINISTRIES
WHICH
WERE
NOW
CALLED
DISCIPLING
MINISTRIES
YOU
WERE
EITHER
DISCIPLING
EVANGELIZING
OR
YOU
WERE
DEAD
THEY
ALSO
USED
THE
NICKNAME
MOVEMENT
OF
GOD
FOR
A
WHILE
BY
SUMMER
OF
CROSSROADS
WAS
WITHDRAWN
FROM
THE
MOVEMENT
AND
NOW
STOOD
ALONE
THEY
HAD
FEW
TO
NO
ALLIES
IN
THE
MAINSTREAM
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
AND
NOW
NONE
IN
THE
MOVEMENT
BOSTON
HOWEVER
CONTINUED
TO
CHART
ITS
COURSE
IN
THE
DIRECTION
THAT
THEY
HAD
BEEN
FOLLOWING
THEY
SENT
RECONSTRUCTION
TEAMS
TO
MANY
CITIES
WHICH
USUALLY
MEANT
THAT
THEY
SPLIT
THE
CHURCH
THERE
THEY
STOPPED
ACKNOWLEDGING
OTHER
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
AS
CHRISTIANS
AND
BEGAN
TO
CALL
THEMSELVES
THE
REMNANT
THE
REMNANT
OF
THE
JEWS
IN
THE
OT
ARE
THOSE
WHO
ARE
SAVED
BY
GOD
IT
WAS
FELT
THAT
THE
REMNANT
TODAY
REPRESENTS
ALL
THE
CHRISTIANS
SOMETIMES
THEY
WOULD
SIMPLY
CALL
THEIR
MOVEMENT
THE
CHURCH
THEY
USUALLY
TOOK
THE
NAME
OF
THE
CITY
FOR
THEIR
NAME
IMPLYING
TO
THE
OTHER
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
THAT
BOSTON
DID
NOT
RECOGNIZE
THEIR
EXISTENCE
MANY
CAMPUSES
HAVE
NOW
FORMALLY
FORBIDDEN
BOSTON
MINISTRIES
FROM
RECRUITING
THERE
DUE
TO
THE
NUMBER
OF
COMPLAINTS
IN
SOME
CASES
IT
HAS
BEEN
DOCUMENTED
THAT
BOSTON
MINISTRIES
HAVE
LIED
TO
UNIVERSITY
OFFICIALS
IN
ORDER
TO
CONTINUE
TO
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THE
CAMPUS
ANY
RESISTANCE
THAT
THEY
EXPERIENCE
IS
TERMED
PERSE
CUTION
WHICH
ALL
TRUE
CHRISTIANS
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
EXPERIENCE
ARE
YOU
REALLY
A
CHRISTIAN
IF
YOURE
NOT
BEING
PERSECUTED
THE
NUMBERS
AT
BOSTON
PEAKED
AT
IN
SINCE
THEN
THEY
HAVE
FOUGHT
TO
REMAIN
STEADY
I
HAVE
HEARD
A
TAPE
OF
KIP
MCKEAN
SHOUTING
AT
THE
LEADERS
FOR
FAILING
TO
FULFILL
THE
GREAT
COMMISSION
THEIR
LIFES
PURPOSE
AS
GOD
COMMANDED
THEM
THEIR
CHRISTIANITY
IS
HIGHLY
CENTERED
ON
COMMANDS
AND
OBEDIENCE
CROSSROADS
ONCE
WAS
CALLED
A
CULT
BOSTON
IS
NOW
RECOGNIZED
BY
THE
CULT
AWARENESS
NETWORK
AND
OTHER
NATIONAL
AND
INTERNATIONAL
GROUPS
AS
A
CULT
UNDER
A
FORMAL
DEFINITION
BECAUSE
OF
THE
TECHNIQUES
WHICH
THEY
EMPLOY
THE
TERM
CULT
IS
USUALLY
DIFFERENTIATED
FROM
SECT
BY
THE
PRACTICE
OF
THOSE
TECHNIQUES
THE
TECHNIQUES
WHICH
THEY
EMPLOY
ARE
RECOGNIZED
BY
MANY
AS
BEING
TECHNIQUES
OF
DESTRUCTIVE
PURSUASION
ALSO
USED
BY
OTHER
SHEPHERDING
DISCIPLESHIP
GROUPS
ROBERT
JAY
LIFTON
MARGARET
THALER
SINGER
AND
MANY
OTHERS
HAVE
WRITTEN
ABOUT
THE
TOPIC
THESE
TECHNIQUES
INCLUDE
GUILT
MOTIVATION
EMOTIONAL
MANIPULATION
LOADED
LANGUAGE
THE
AURA
OF
SACRED
SCIENCE
A
SORT
OF
MYSTIC
ELEMENT
SEEN
IN
EVERYDAY
EVENTS
AND
OTHERS
I
HAVE
NO
PARTICULAR
AXE
TO
GRIND
AGAINST
THE
MOVEMENT
I
HAVE
NUMER
OUS
FRIENDS
WHO
ARE
STILL
PART
OF
THE
MOVEMENT
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
A
FALLING
OUT
WITH
ANYONE
IN
THE
MOVEMENT
I
DISAGREE
WITH
MANY
THINGS
WHICH
THEY
TEACH
I
RECOGNIZE
THE
PSYCHOLOGICAL
DAMAGE
DONE
BY
BEING
INVOLVED
IN
SUCH
A
SYSTEM
I
HOLD
NO
LOYALTY
TO
THE
MAINSTREAM
CHURCHES
OF
CHRIST
AND
DO
NOT
DEFEND
THEIR
MISTAKES
EITHER
I
WANT
TO
POINT
OUT
THOUGH
THAT
UNLIKE
IN
MANY
OTHER
SYSTEMS
WHICH
ARE
IN
OTHER
WAYS
SIMILAR
THE
LEADERSHIP
OF
THE
BOSTON
MOVEMENT
ARE
AS
MUCH
VICTIMS
OF
THE
SYSTEM
AS
THE
MEMBERS
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
LEADER
WHO
ENJOYS
MANIPULATING
HIS
PEOPLE
THE
LEADERS
BELIEVE
WHAT
THEY
TEACH
AND
THEY
FEEL
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
THE
ACTIVITES
AND
SPIRITUAL
WELFARE
OF
THE
MEMBERS
WHEN
MEMBERS
DO
NOT
EVANGELIZE
TO
THEIR
EXPECTATIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
LEADERS
FEEL
PERSONALLY
RESPONSIBLE
AS
WELL
THE
LEADERS
ARE
NOT
OUT
FOR
MONEY
OR
POWER
THEY
WANT
TO
EVANGELIZE
THE
WORLD
IN
THEIR
LIFETIME
I
HAVE
SAID
TOO
MUCH
BUT
THERE
IS
MUCH
MORE
TO
SAY
THERE
ARE
MANY
EXAMPLES
I
COULD
GIVE
AND
QUOTES
FROM
OTHER
SOURCES
INCLUDING
BOSTON
BULLETINS
THAT
I
COULD
