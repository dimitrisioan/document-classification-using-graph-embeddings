hello
all
we
are
doing
a
bible
study
at
my
college
on
revelations
we
have
been
doing
pretty
good
as
far
as
getting
some
sort
of
reasonable
interpretation
we
are
now
on
chapters
and
which
talk
about
the
woman
on
the
beast
and
the
fall
of
babylon
i
believe
the
beast
is
the
antichrist
some
may
differ
but
it
seems
obvious
and
the
woman
represents
babylon
which
stands
for
rome
or
the
roman
catholic
church
what
are
some
views
on
this
interpretation
is
the
falling
babylon
in
chapter
the
same
babylon
in
as
in
chapter
the
catholic
church
hate
to
step
on
toes
thanks
an
interesting
interpretation
of
revelation
and
has
been
given
by
evangelist
david
wilkerson
i
am
not
saying
that
i
totally
agree
with
his
interpretation
but
it
is
certainly
believable
and
good
food
for
thought
he
interprets
the
babylon
of
revelation
as
being
none
other
than
the
good
old
u
s
of
a
thats
right
america
he
supports
his
claim
in
several
ways
the
babylon
of
revelation
is
the
world
leader
in
trade
and
commerce
and
the
whole
world
wept
when
babylon
fell
the
american
dollar
despite
the
japanese
success
of
the
century
is
still
the
most
sought
after
currency
in
the
world
if
the
us
were
destroyed
wouldnt
the
whole
world
mourn
the
bible
also
talks
about
babylon
being
a
home
of
harlots
sin
and
adultery
i
am
paraphrasing
of
course
babylons
sin
affected
or
should
i
say
infected
the
whole
world
it
doesnt
take
much
looking
to
see
that
the
us
is
in
a
state
of
moral
decay
hasnt
the
american
culture
and
hollywood
spread
the
do
it
if
it
feels
good
mentality
all
over
the
world
i
think
though
that
what
mr
wilkerson
uses
as
his
strongest
argument
is
the
fact
that
revelation
calls
babylon
babylon
the
great
and
portrays
it
as
the
most
powerful
nation
on
earth
no
matter
how
dissatisfied
you
are
with
the
state
of
our
country
i
dont
think
you
would
have
too
much
trouble
agreeing
that
the
us
is
still
the
most
powerful
nation
on
earth
again
this
interpretation
is
not
necessarily
my
own
but
i
do
find
it
worthy
of
consideration
