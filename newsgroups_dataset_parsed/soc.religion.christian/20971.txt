WRITES
YOU
CANNOT
SHOW
FROM
SCRIPTURE
THAT
THE
WEEKLY
SABBATH
IS
PART
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAWS
BEFORE
YOU
POST
A
TEXT
IN
REPLY
INVESTIGATE
ITS
CONTEXT
FIRST
OF
ALL
CEREMONIAL
LAW
IS
AN
EXTRASCRIPTURAL
TERM
IT
IS
SOMETIMES
USED
AS
A
FRAMEWORK
TO
VIEW
SCRIPTURE
BUT
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
COLLOSIONS
WITHOUT
GOING
INTO
IT
WITH
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
SABBATH
CANNOT
BE
A
CEREMONIAL
LAW
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
IT
DOES
REFER
TO
THE
SABBATH
PAUL
WRITES
IN
COLLOSIONS
HOW
THAT
CHRIST
NAILED
THE
LAWS
THAT
WERE
AGAINST
US
TO
HIS
CROSS
AND
THEREFORE
WE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
JUDGED
IN
WHAT
WHAT
FOOD
WE
EAT
WHAT
WE
DRINK
THE
KEEPING
OF
NEW
MOONS
AND
HOLY
DAYS
OR
THE
KEEPING
OF
THE
SABBATH
THE
WORD
FOR
SABBATH
IN
THIS
VERSE
IS
SABBATON
AND
IS
USED
THROUGHOUT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
TO
REFER
TO
THE
DAY
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
SCRIPTURE
FROM
WHICH
WE
GET
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAW
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
THE
SABBATH
IS
LISTED
AMONG
THE
CEREMONIAL
LAWS
IF
ONE
GOES
INTO
THIS
WITH
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
ASSUMPTION
THE
SABBATH
CANNOT
BE
A
CEREMONIAL
LAW
THEN
HE
WILL
HAVE
TO
FIND
SOME
WAY
AROUND
IT
LIKE
SAYING
THAT
THIS
CAN
ONLY
REFER
TO
THE
OTHER
SABBATH
HOLY
DAYS
BESIDES
THE
DAY
BECAUSE
THE
SABBATH
CANNOT
BE
A
CEREMONIAL
LAW
BUT
PAUL
IS
VERY
CAREFUL
IN
HIS
LETTERS
TO
ADD
SOME
KIND
OF
PARENTHETCAL
STATEMENT
IF
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
THAT
CAN
BE
SEEN
AS
A
LISCENCE
TO
SIN
IN
HIS
WRITINGS
ALSO
WHY
IS
THE
SABBATH
ABSENT
FROM
THE
EPISTLES
EXCEPT
FOR
HEBREWS
WHICH
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
REST
THAT
COMES
THROUGH
FAITH
SURELY
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
BIG
PROBLEM
FOR
FIRST
CENTURY
CHRISTIANS
LIVING
IN
A
SOCIETY
THAT
DID
NOT
REST
ON
THE
DAY
ESPECIALLY
SLAVES
MANY
NEW
CONVERST
WERE
SLAVES
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DIFFICULT
FOR
SLAVES
TO
REST
ON
THE
SABBATH
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
MANDATORY
WHY
IS
THERE
NO
MENTION
OF
THIS
IN
THE
EPISTLES
