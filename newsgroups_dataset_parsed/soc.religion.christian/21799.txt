THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
STEPHEN
A
CREPS
WRITES
TO
ALL
SAC
ALSO
WE
KNOW
THAT
SAC
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THAT
EVERYONE
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
WHERE
EXACTLY
DOES
IT
SAY
THAT
SAC
EVERYONE
INCLUDES
INFANTS
UNLESS
THERE
IS
OTHER
SCRIPTURE
TO
THE
SAC
CONTRARY
IE
AN
EXCEPTION
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
EXCEPTION
LISTED
IN
THE
SAC
BIBLE
WE
MUST
ASSUME
TO
BE
ON
THE
SAFE
SIDE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
MEANS
WHAT
SAC
IT
SAYS
THAT
EVERYONE
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
I
THINK
WE
DO
SEE
AN
EXCEPTION
IN
THE
CASE
OF
CORNELIUS
AND
HIS
HOUSEHOLD
MENTIONED
IN
ACTS
OF
COURSE
THEY
WERE
BAPTISED
BUT
ONLY
AFTER
GOD
SHOWED
THAT
HE
ACCEPTED
THEM
BY
GIVING
THEM
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THIS
MEANS
THEY
WERE
ALREADY
ACCEPTABLE
TO
GOD
BEFORE
THEIR
BAPTISM
AND
HAD
THEY
SUDDENLY
DIED
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
TO
HEAVEN
IN
CASE
THAT
SEEMS
FARFETCHED
AN
ANCESTOR
OF
MINE
WAS
A
MISSIONARY
WHO
WORKED
AMONG
THE
HEREROS
IN
NAMIBIA
SOME
OF
THE
TRIBESMEN
WERE
JEALOUS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AND
THEY
POISONED
THE
FIRST
CONVERT
BEFORE
HE
COULD
BE
BAPTISED
SURELY
HE
STILL
WENT
TO
HEAVEN
IM
INCLINED
TO
AGREE
WITH
A
COMMENT
RECORDED
AT
THE
TIME
IT
IS
NOT
THE
NEGLECT
OF
BAPTISM
BUT
ITS
CONTEMPT
THAT
