TRANSLATIONS
IN
ARTICLE
ANDI
BEYER
WRITES
WHICH
VERSION
OF
THE
BIBLE
DO
YOU
CONSIDER
TO
BE
THE
MOST
ACCURATE
TRANSLATION
WELL
KNOWING
GREEK
AND
HEBREW
IM
PROBABLY
NOT
AS
PICKY
ABOUT
TRANSLATIONS
AS
I
WOULD
BE
IF
ENGLISH
TRANSLATIONS
WERE
MY
ONLY
SOURCE
OF
INFORMATION
BUT
ANY
VERSE
THAT
COMES
OUT
SUBSTANTIALLY
DIFFERENT
IN
DIFFERENT
TRANS
LATIONS
IS
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
UNCLEAR
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
IT
IS
VERY
BAD
PRACTICE
TO
SHOP
FOR
A
TRANSLATION
THAT
FITS
YOUR
OWN
DOCTRINAL
POSITIONS
PERSONALLY
I
STILL
LIKE
THE
RSV
NRSV
AND
NASV
ARE
ALSO
VERY
GOOD
I
HAVE
A
STRONG
PREFERENCE
FOR
EDITIONS
THAT
DO
NOT
INDENT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
EACH
VERSE
AS
IF
VERSES
WERE
PARAGRAPHS
THE
VERSE
NUMBERING
IS
A
RELATIVELY
MODERN
ADDITION
AND
SHOULD
NOT
BE
GIVEN
