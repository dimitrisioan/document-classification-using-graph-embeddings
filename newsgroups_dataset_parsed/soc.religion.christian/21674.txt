SCOTTPRISMGATECHEDU
SCOTT
HOLT
WRITES
HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNERIVE
HEARD
THAT
QUITE
A
BIT
RECENTLY
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
THAT
STATEMENT
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
THINK
NOT
HATE
BEGETS
MORE
HATE
NEVER
LOVE
IN
THE
SUMMARY
OF
THE
LAW
CHRIST
COMMANDS
US
TO
LOVE
GOD
AND
TO
LOVE
OUR
NEIGHBORS
HE
DOESNT
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HATE
IN
FACT
IF
ANYTHING
HE
COMMANDS
US
TO
SAVE
OUR
CRITICISMS
FOR
OURSELVES
SCOTT
I
TOO
DISLIKE
THE
PHRASE
HATE
THE
SIN
LOVE
THE
SINNER
MAYBE
THE
DEFINITE
ARTICLE
IS
ALSO
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
SINCE
IT
SEEMS
TO
GIVE
US
LICENSE
TO
FIXATE
ON
OUR
BROTHERS
PECULIAR
PECADILLO
WHICH
WE
HAVE
MANAGED
TO
ESCAPE
BY
A
COMMON
GRACE
OF
HEREDITY
ECONOMIC
SITUATION
OR
CULTURE
OUR
OUTRAGE
AT
EVIL
IS
TOO
OFTEN
JUST
A
CHEAP
SHOT
THAT
SAID
I
DONT
THINK
SCOTT
HAS
ADEQUATELY
EXPLORED
THE
FLIP
SIDE
OF
THIS
COIN
NAMELY
THE
LOVE
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
IN
THE
BEATITUDES
JESUS
BLESSED
THOSE
WHO
HUNGERED
AND
THIRSTED
FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
IT
IS
NEVER
ENOUGH
JUST
TO
BEHAVE
WELL
ONE
SHOULD
ALWAYS
ACTIVELY
DESIRE
AND
WORK
FOR
THE
CAUSE
OF
GOOD
IN
THAT
SENSE
IT
SHOULD
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
REMAIN
DISPASSIONATE
ABOUT
EVIL
AND
ITS
VICTIMS
EVEN
WHEN
THESE
ARE
ITS
ACCOMPLICES
AS
WELL
MAYBE
MOURN
SIN
LOVE
SINNERS
CATCHES
THE
IDEA
SLIGHTLY
BETTER
THAN
HATE
BUT
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
SINCE
GRIEF
USUALLY
IMPLIES
A
PASSIVE
POWERLESS
POSITION
A
BALANCED
CHRISTIAN
RESPONSE
NEEDS
GRIEF
LOVE
AND
CAREFULLY
MEASURED
CONSTRUCTIVE
ANGER
JESUS
HAS
ALL
THREE
THE
EUROPEAN
PIETISTS
DURING
WWII
WHOSE
RESPONSE
TO
NAZI
ATROCITIES
WAS
DEVOID
OF
ANGER
DO
NOT
FARE
WELL
AS
ROLE
MODELS
HOWEVER
MUCH
LOVE
OR
GRIEF
THEY
EXEMPLIFIED
MY
SISTER
IS
AN
ACTRESS
IN
NEW
YORK
AND
A
CHRISTIAN
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
JACK
HER
LONGTIME
PROFESSIONAL
FRIEND
AND
BENEFACTOR
DIED
OF
AIDS
IMPOVERISHED
BY
MEDICAL
BILLS
ESTRANGED
FROM
HIS
FAMILY
AND
ABANDONED
BY
MOST
OF
HIS
SURVIVING
FRIENDS
ONLY
MY
SISTER
AND
BROTHERINLAW
WERE
THERE
WITH
HIM
AT
THE
VERY
END
IN
HER
GRIEF
OVER
JACKS
DEATH
MY
SISTER
FOUND
QUITE
A
FEW
TARGETS
FOR
ANGER
CALLOUS
BUREAUCRACIES
THE
RIGID
SELFPROTECTIVE
MORALISM
OF
JACKS
FAMILY
THE
INERTIA
IN
CHRISTIANS
RESPONSE
TO
AIDS
AND
YES
EVEN
JACKS
OWN
LAPSE
IN
MORALITY
THAT
EVENTUALLY
COST
HIM
HIS
LIFE
JACK
HIMSELF
SHARED
THAT
LAST
ANGER
BROUGHT
UP
WITH
STRONG
CHRISTIAN
VALUES
HE
WAS
CONTRITE
OVER
HIS
BRIEF
DALLIANCE
WITH
PROMISCUOUS
SEX
LONG
BEFORE
HIS
AIDS
APPEARED
I
IMPLY
NO
MORAL
JUDGEMENT
HERE
ABOUT
JACKS
INNATE
SEXUAL
ORIENTATION
NB
MAYBE
THE
HARDEST
JOB
IS
MAKING
OUR
ANGER
