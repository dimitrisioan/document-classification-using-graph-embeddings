HOMOSEXUALITY
ISSUES

CHRISTIANITY

WRITES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
ONE
IMPORTANT
THING
THAT
THOSE
WHO
WROTE
THE
OLD
AND
NEW
TESTAMENT
PASSAGES
CITED
ABOVE
DID
NOT
KNOW
WAS
THAT
THERE
IS
SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE
TO
SUPPORT
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
AT
LEAST
PARTLY
INHERENT
RATHER
THAN
COMPLETELY
LEARNED
NOTE
THAT
SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE
IN
THIS
AREA
DOES
NOT
PROVE
ANY
CONCLUSIONS
THERE
HAS
BEEN
EVIDENCE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
A
CERTAIN
PART
OF
HOMOSEXUALS
BRAINS
ARE
DIFFERENT
FROM
HETEROSEXUALS
BUT
THAT
PROVES
VERY
LITTLE
ALSO
NOTICE
THAT
THE
APOSTLES
DID
NOT
HAVE
WITH
THEM
THE
SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE
LINKING
CERTAIN
GENES
WITH
ALCOHOLISM
OR
STEALING
WITH
CERTAIN
GENETIC
PROBLEMS
EVEN
IF
THEY
DID
HAVE
SCIENTIFIC
EVIDENCE
I
DOUBT
IT
WOULD
HAVE
STOPPED
THEM
FROM
COMMUNICATING
THE
TEACHING
FROM
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THAT
THESE
THINGS
ARE
SINFUL
THIS
REMINDS
ME
OF
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
A
PROFESSOR
OF
MINE
HE
SAID
SOMETHING
VERY
TRUE
CHRISTIANITY
TEACHES
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
GIVE
IN
TO
OUR
EVERY
INCLINATION
MOST
PEOPLE
DO
GIVE
IN
TO
THEIR
LEANINGS
IN
CHRISTIANITY
WE
HAVE
THE
CONCEPT
OF
STRUGGLING
WITH
THE
FLESH
AND
BRINGING
IT
INTO
SUBMISSION
ONE
PERSON
MAY
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
HIS
TEMPER
AND
HAVING
A
MURDEROUS
HEART
ANOTHER
MAY
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
HOMOSEXUALITY
ANOTHER
MAY
BE
INCLINED
TO
GREED
BUT
GOD
OFFERS
US
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
BE
MORE
THAN
CONQUERERS
SOURCES
WHERE
YOU
CAN
FIND
THIS
INFORMATION
THERE
IS
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
RECORDED
AMONG
MONKEYS
AND
OTHER
ANIMALS
WHICH
IS
IN
ITSELF
SUGGESTIVE
THAT
IT
IS
INHERENT
RATHER
THAN
LEARNED
OR
AT
LEAST
THAT
THE
WORD
UNNATURAL
SHOULDNT
REALLY
APPLY
THE
PREYING
MANTIS
BITES
THE
HEAD
OFF
OF
HER
MATE
AFTER
SHE
MATES
WITH
HIM
IS
IT
NATURAL
FOR
A
WOMAN
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THING
TO
HER
HUSBAND
THE
BIBLE
IS
CONCERNED
WITH
HUMAN
MORALITY
AND
ONLY
TOUCHES
ON
ANIMAL
MORALITY
AS
IT
RELATES
TO
HUMANS
LINK
