WROTE
JEFF
FENHOLT
CLAIMS
TO
HAVE
ONCE
BEEN
A
ROADIE
FOR
BLACK
SABBATH
HE
WAS
NEVER
EVER
A
MUSICIAN
IN
THE
BAND
HE
WAS
IN
ST
LOUIS
SEVERAL
MONTHS
BACK
THE
POSTER
I
SAW
AT
THE
CHRISTIAN
BOOKSTORE
I
FREQUENT
REALLY
TURNED
ME
OFF
IT
WAS
ADDRESSED
TO
ALL
HOMOSEXUALS
PROSTITUTES
DRUG
ADDICTS
ALCOHOLICS
AND
HEADBANGERS
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WELL
IF
I
SHOWED
UP
WITH
MY
LONG
HAIR
AND
BLACK
LEATHER
JACKET
I
WOULD
HAVE
FELT
A
LITTLE
PREJUDGED
I
HAVE
SEEN
JEFF
FENHOLT
SPEAK
AND
I
DIDNT
FIND
HIM
JUDGEMENTAL
I
THINK
THAT
THE
WORDING
FOR
THAT
ADD
WAS
CERTAINLY
INAPPROPRIATE
BUT
I
THINK
THEY
WERE
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
HEADBANGERS
WOULD
LIKE
THE
PROGRAM
BUT
I
WOULD
NOT
PUT
HEADBANGERS
IN
THE
SAME
CLASS
AS
ALCHOLICS
ETC
IT
IS
CONDESCENDING
AND
I
BELIEVE
THAT
JEFF
WAS
WEARING
BLACK
WHEN
I
SAW
HIM
BY
THE
WAY
FENHOLT
PLAYED
JESUS
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
SUPERSTAR
PERSONALLY
IM
A
HEADBANGER
AT
TIMES
TOO
BUT
I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
WITH
WHAT
MOST
OF
THE
SECULAR
METAL
GROUPS
PROMOTE
FREE
SEX
AND
DRUGS
MY
OPINION
THAT
MANY
PROMOTE
THESE
ARENT
MY
THING
I
HAVE
FOUND
SEVERAL
GOOD
CHRISTIAN
METAL
GROUPS
THAT
I
LIKE
JON
JON
OGDEN
MOTOROLA
CELLULAR
ADVANCED
PRODUCTS
DIVISION
VOICE
DATA
THEY
DREW
A
CIRCLE
AND
SHUT
HIM
OUT
HERETIC
REBEL
A
THING
TO
FLOUT
BUT
LOVE
AND
I
HAD
THE
WIT
TO
WIN
WE
DREW
A
CIRCLE
AND
TOOK
HIM
IN
