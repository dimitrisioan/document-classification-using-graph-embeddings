claims
to
have
once
been
a
roadie
for
black
sabbath
he
was
never
ever
a
musician
in
the
band
he
was
in
st
louis
several
months
back
the
poster
i
saw
at
the
christian
bookstore
i
frequent
really
turned
me
off
it
was
addressed
to
all
homosexuals
prostitutes
drug
addicts
alcoholics
and
headbangers
or
something
like
that
well
if
i
showed
up
with
my
long
hair
and
black
leather
jacket
i
would
have
felt
a
little
prejudged
i
have
seen
jeff
fenholt
speak
and
i
didnt
find
him
judgemental
i
think
that
the
wording
for
that
add
was
certainly
inappropriate
but
i
think
they
were
trying
to
say
that
headbangers
would
like
the
program
but
i
would
not
put
headbangers
in
the
same
class
as
alcholics
etc
it
is
condescending
and
i
believe
that
jeff
was
wearing
black
when
i
saw
him
by
the
way
fenholt
played
jesus
in
jesus
christ
superstar
personally
im
a
headbanger
at
times
too
but
i
have
a
hard
time
with
what
most
of
the
secular
metal
groups
promote
free
sex
and
drugs
my
opinion
that
many
promote
these
arent
my
thing
i
have
found
several
good
christian
metal
groups
that
i
like
jon
jon
ogden
motorola
cellular
advanced
products
division
voice
data
they
drew
a
circle
and
shut
him
out
heretic
rebel
a
thing
to
flout
but
love
and
i
had
the
wit
to
win
we
drew
a
circle
and
took
him
in
