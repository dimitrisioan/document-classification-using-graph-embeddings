TIMOTHY

BRENT
WRITES
I
HAVE
STATED
BEFORE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
MYSELF
AN
ATHEIST
BUT
DEFINITELY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
COMBINED
WITH
A
POST
TO
ANOTHER
GROUP
TO
THE
EFFECT
OF
YOU
WILL
ALL
GO
TO
HELL
HAS
ME
INTERESTED
IN
THE
CONSENSUS
AS
TO
HOW
A
GOD
MIGHT
JUDGE
MEN
AS
A
CATHOLIC
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
A
JEW
BUDDHIST
ETC
MIGHT
GO
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
OBVIOUSLY
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THIS
EVEN
MORE
SEE
ATHEISTS
AND
PAGANS
I
ASSUME
I
WOULD
BE
LUMPED
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
TO
BE
HELLBOUND
I
KNOW
YOU
BELIEVE
ONLY
GOD
CAN
JUDGE
AND
I
DO
NOT
ASK
YOU
TO
JUST
FOR
YOUR
OPINIONS
DEAR
TIM
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
WERE
A
CATHOLIC
BUT
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
MEANS
THE
GOD
OF
THE
BIBLE
AND
PUBLICLY
STATE
THIS
YOU
ARE
IN
ALL
PROBABILITY
NOT
A
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
PUBLIC
HERETICS
EVEN
THOSE
WHO
ERR
IN
GOOD
FAITH
MATERIAL
HERETICS
DO
NOT
BELONG
TO
THE
BODY
OF
THE
CHURCH
FUNDAMENTALS
OF
CATHOLIC
DOGMA
LUDWIG
OTT
P
ALL
IS
NOT
LOST
HOWEVER
AS
YOU
STILL
MIGHT
BELONG
SPIRITUALLY
TO
THE
CHURCH
BY
YOUR
DESIRE
TO
BELONG
TO
IT
AS
YOU
SAID
ONLY
GOD
CAN
JUDGE
THE
CONDITION
OF
A
MANS
SOUL
ABOUT
JUDGMENT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ST
PAUL
COR
URGES
CHRISTIANS
TO
JUDGE
THEIR
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
FOLLOWING
THE
APOSTLES
TEACHING
I
JUDGE
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
RECONSIDER
RETURNING
TO
THE
CHRISTIAN
FOLD
AND
EMBRACE
THE
GOD
OF
ABRAHAM
ISAAC
AND
JACOB
HE
IS
THE
GOD
WHO
LIVES
CONCERNING
WHAT
YOU
WERE
TOLD
ABOUT
NONBELIEVERS
WHEN
YOU
WERE
A
CATHOLIC
THAT
IS
TRUE
AS
I
HAVE
POSTED
BEFORE
VATICAN
II
LUMEN
GENTIUM
II
N
TEACHES
THOSE
WHO
THROUGH
NO
FAULT
OF
THEIR
OWN
DO
NOT
KNOW
THE
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
OR
HIS
CHRUCH
BUT
WHO
NEVERTHELESS
SEEK
GOD
WITH
A
SINCERE
HEART
AND
MOVED
BY
GRACE
TRY
IN
THEIR
ACTIONS
TO
DO
HIS
WILL
AS
THEY
KNOW
IT
THROUGH
THE
DICTATES
OF
THEIR
CONSCIENCE
THOSE
TOO
MAY
ACHIEVE
ETERNAL
SALVATION
RESPONDING
TO
YOUR
SOLICITATION
FOR
OPINIONS
ON
THE
THINKING
PROCESSES
OF
GOD
THE
BEST
I
CAN
DO
IS
REFER
YOU
TO
SCRIPTURE
SCRIPTURE
IS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
SOURCES
FOR
LEARNING
WHAT
CAN
BE
KNOWN
ABOUT
GOD
STICK
WITH
THE
BEST
BOUNDARY
THE
CATECHIST
NO
TENEIS
QUE
PENSAR
QUE
YO
HAYA
VENIDO
A
TRAER
LA
PAZ
A

NO
HE
VENIDO
A
