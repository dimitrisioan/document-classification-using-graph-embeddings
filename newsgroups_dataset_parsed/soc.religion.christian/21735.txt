RE
MARYS
ASSUMPTION
DAVIDBERNARDCENTRALSUNCOM
DAVE
BERNARD
WRITES
WHEN
ELIZABETH
GREETED
MARY
ELIZABETH
SAID
SOMETHING
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
MARY
OUT
OF
ALL
WOMEN
WAS
BLESSED
IF
SO
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THIS
EXACTLY
PLACES
MARY
BEYOND
THE
SANCTIFICATION
OF
NORMAL
HUMANITY
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
THIS
LOGICALLY
FOLLOWS
TRUE
ENOUGH
MARY
RECEIVED
A
BLESSING
BEYOND
ANY
GRANTED
IN
ALL
THE
HISTORY
OF
HUMANITY
BY
BEING
PRIVILEGED
TO
BE
THE
MOTHER
OF
THE
SAVIOR
IT
SAYS
NOTHING
ABOUT
MARY
NEEDING
TO
BE
A
BLESSED
PERSON
FIRST
IN
ORDER
THAT
SHE
MIGHT
THEREBY
BE
WORTHY
TO
BEAR
THE
SON
OF
GOD
AGAIN
I
THINK
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
AS
HUMANS
WE
CANT
COMPREHEND
HOW
THE
SINLESS
INCARNATION
COULD
SPRING
FROM
SINFUL
HUMAN
FLESH
AND
GODS
SPIRIT
RATHER
THAN
SIMPLY
ACCEPT
THE
GRACIOUS
MIRACLE
OF
GOD
WE
MUST
NEEDS
TRY
TO
DOPE
OUT
A
MECHANISM
OR
RATIONALE
AS
TO
HOW
THIS
COULD
BE
MARYS
OWN
WORDS
MY
SPIRIT
REJOICES
IN
GOD
MY
SAVIOR
FOR
HE
HAS
REGARDED
THE
LOW
ESTATE
OF
HIS
HANDMAIDEN
SOUND
LIKE
THE
WORDS
OF
A
HUMAN
AWARE
OF
HER
OWN
HUMANITY
IN
NEED
OF
A
SAVIOR
SIMILAR
TO
WHAT
DAVID
PROCLAIMED
IN
HIS
PSALMSNOT
THE
WORDS
OF
A
HOLY
BEING
WITH
NO
FURTHER
NEED
FOR
GODS
GRACE
I
REALLY
APOLOGIZE
FOR
HARPING
ON
THIS
I
DONT
SUPPOSE
ITS
IMPORTANT
ITS
JUST
THAT
I
SEE
MARY
AND
JOSEPH
AND
THE
BABY
REDUCED
TO
PLACID
SERENE
FIGURINES
I
FEEL
WE
LOSE
THE
WONDER
IN
THE
FACT
THAT
GOD
CHOSE
TO
COME
DOWN
TO
YOU
AND
I
TO
BE
BORN
OF
PEOPLE
LIKE
YOU
AND
I
TO
SHARE
OUR
EXISTENCE
AND
REDEEM
US
FROM
ITS
FALLENNESS
BY
HIS
HOLY
INCARNATION
