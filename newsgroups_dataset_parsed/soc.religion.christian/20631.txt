re
what
did
lazarus
smell
like

my
guess
is
that
the
lazarus
come
out
was
also
for
the
sake
of
the
crowd
i
read
somewhere
i
think
in
morton
smiths
jesus
the
magician
that
old
lazarus
wasnt
dead
but
going
in
the
tomb
was
part
of
an
initiation
rite
for
a
magicult
of
which
jesus
was
also
a
part
it
appears
that
a
stay
was
normal
i
wonder
i
havent
read
that
book
but
another
one
by
smith
in
which
similar
claims
were
made
about
jesus
while
im
sure
smith
knows
more
about
early
chrisitanity
than
i
do
i
found
his
arguments
similar
to
those
of
books
like
holy
blood
holy
grail
building
conjectures
on
top
of
other
conjectures
there
was
no
direct
evidence
if
youd
like
to
summarize
the
argument
for
us
id
be
happy
to
see
it
but
in
doing
so
id
like
you
to
pay
careful
attention
to
the
nature
of
the
evidence
