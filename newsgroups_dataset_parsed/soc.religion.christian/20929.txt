WROTE
THE
DISCUSSION
BEGINS
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
ONE
OF
THE
LAWS
OF
NATURE
SPECIFYING
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
SEEMS
TO
DICTATE
AT
LEAST
TO
THIS
LAYMANS
MIND
THERE
MUST
BE
A
CAUSAL
EVENT
NO
REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVE
EXISTS
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
CAUSALITY
IS
ACTUALLY
A
PROPERTY
OF
SPACETIME
CAUSES
PRECEDE
THEIR
EFFECTS
BUT
IF
YOU
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
MUST
BE
AN
ANSWER
TO
HOW
DID
THE
UNIVERSE
OUR
SPACETIME
EMERGE
FROM
NOTHING
SCIENCE
HAS
SOME
GOOD
CANDIDATES
FOR
AN
ANSWER
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
WONDERED
WHY
CHRISTIANS
USE
THE
THERE
ARE
QUESTIONS
SCIENCE
OR
ATHEISM
CANNOT
ANSWER
ARGUMENT
I
HOPE
THIS
IS
THE
APPROPRIATE
GROUP
TO
ASK
THIS
QUESTION
THE
MOST
POPULAR
QUESTION
IS
THE
QUESTION
OF
ORIGINS
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
OR
ANYTHING
FOR
THAT
MATTER
I
THINK
THIS
QUESTION
SHOULD
ACTUALLY
BE
SPLIT
INTO
TWO
PARTS
NAMELY
WHY
IS
THERE
EXISTENCE
WHY
ANYTHING
EXISTS
AND
HOW
DID
THE
UNIVERSE
EMERGE
FROM
NOTHING
IT
IS
CLEAR
SCIENCE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
HOWEVER
IS
IT
A
MEANINGFUL
QUESTION
AFTER
ALL
I
WOULD
SAY
IT
ISNT
CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
A
DIEHARD
SKEPTIC
BEING
BE
IT
HUMAN
OR
WHATEVER
ATTEMPTS
TO
DOUBT
ONES
VERY
EXISTENCE
SINCE
IT
IS
SO
EASY
TO
DOUBT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
I
CANNOT
BE
SURE
THE
WORLD
EXISTS
IT
MAY
BE
MY
MIND
FOOLING
ME
CAN
I
EVER
BE
SURE
I
EXIST
HOWEVER
IT
IS
ONLY
POSSIBLE
TO
EXIST
OR
NOT
TO
EXIST
SOMEONE
INSERT
AN
APPROPRIATE
SHAKESPEARE
QUOTE
HERE
A
BEING
THAT
DOES
NOT
EXIST
CANNOT
DOUBT
ONES
EXISTENCE
A
BEING
THAT
DOES
EXIST
CAN
DOUBT
ONES
EXISTENCE
BUT
THIS
WOULD
BE
POINTLESS
THE
BEING
WOULD
EXIST
ANYWAY
LET
US
RETURN
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
WHY
A
BEING
THAT
DOES
NOT
EXIST
DOES
NOT
NEED
ANY
REASONS
FOR
ITS
NONEXISTENCE
THIS
BEING
IS
NOT
SURE
WHETHER
ANYTHING
ELSE
EXISTS
BUT
HIS
MIND
BUT
LET
US
ASSUME
THAT
THE
WORLD
EXISTS
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
MIND
THE
OBJECTIVITY
POSTULATE
THE
QUESTION
WHY
ANYTHING
EXISTS
CAN
BE
COUNTERED
BY
DEMANDING
ANSWER
TO
A
QUESTION
WHY
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
NOTHINGNESS
OR
IN
NONEXISTENCE
ACTUALLY
BOTH
QUESTIONS
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
DEVOID
OF
MEANING
THINGS
THAT
EXIST
DO
AND
THINGS
THAT
DONT
EXIST
DONT
EXIST
TAUTOLOGY
AT
ITS
BEST
I
SERIOUSLY
DOUBT
GOD
COULD
HAVE
AN
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
SOME
CHRISTIANS
I
HAVE
TALKED
TO
HAVE
SAID
THAT
ACTUALLY
GOD
IS
HIMSELF
THE
EXISTENCE
HOWEVER
I
SEE
SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
THIS
ANSWER
FIRST
IT
INEVITABLY
LEADS
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
GOD
IS
ACTUALLY
ALL
EXISTENCE
GOOD
AND
EVIL
DEVILS
AND
ANGELS
US
AND
THEM
THIS
IS
PANTHEISM
NOT
CHRISTIANITY
ANOTHER
ANSWER
IS
THAT
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
SOUNDS
MUCH
BETTER
BUT
I
AM
TEMPTED
TO
ASK
DOES
GOD
HIMSELF
EXIST
THEN
IF
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
OWN
EXISTENCE
IT
CAN
ONLY
MEAN
THAT
HE
HAS
IN
TERMS
OF
HUMAN
TIME
ALWAYS
EXISTED
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
ARGUMENT
SOUNDS
LIKE
GOD
DOES
NOT
EXIST
BUT
METAEXISTS
AND
FROM
HIS
METAEXISTENT
PERSPECTIVE
HE
CREATED
EXISTENCE
I
THINK
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
A
NONSOLUTION
A
MERE
TWIST
OF
WORDS
THE
BEST
ANSWER
I
HAVE
HEARD
IS
THAT
HUMAN
REASONING
IS
INCAPABLE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
SUCH
QUESTIONS
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
MYSELF
I
DO
NOT
ACCEPT
SUCH
ANSWERS
SINCE
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
OTHER
METHODS
THE
SECOND
QUESTION
HOW
DID
THE
UNIVERSE
EMERGE
FROM
NOTHING
BELONGS
TO
THE
DOMAIN
OF
SCIENCE
AND
I
FOR
ONE
DO
NOT
DOUBT
THE
QUESTION
CAN
BE
ANSWERED
BY
ITS
METHODS
MANY
COSMOLOGISTS
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THAT
IT
IS
ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE
FOR
UNIVERSES
TO
EMERGE
FROM
VACUUM
THIS
POSSIBILITY
HAS
BEEN
SUGGESTED
IN
A
RECENT
HAWKING
BIOGRAPHY
SEE
ALSO
LIZHI
SHUXIAN
CREATION
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
WORLD
SCIENTIFIC
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THE
SCI
GROUPS
ARE
MORE
APPROPRIATE
FOR
DISCUSSIONS
LIKE
THIS
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
THE
VERY
LAWS
OF
NATURE
DEMAND
A
WHY
THAT
ISNT
TRUE
OF
SOMETHING
OUTSIDE
OF
NATURE
IE
SUPERNATURAL
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
SCIENCE
IS
A
COLLECTION
OF
MODELS
TELLING
US
HOW
NOT
WHY
SOMETHING
HAPPENS
I
CANNOT
SEE
ANY
GOOD
REASON
WHY
THE
WHY
QUESTIONS
WOULD
BE
BOUND
ONLY
TO
NATURAL
THINGS
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
SUPERNATURAL
DOMAIN
EXISTS
IF
SUPERNATURAL
BEINGS
EXIST
IT
IS
AS
APPROPRIATE
TO
ASK
WHY
THEY
DO
SO
AS
IT
IS
TO
ASK
WHY
WE
EXIST
I
BELIEVE
THE
GENETIC
CODE
WILL
BE
ENTIRELY
DECIPHERED
IN
OUR
LIFETIMES
BUT
WE
WILL
NOT
SEE
MAN
CONVERT
ENTIRELY
INERT
MATERIAL
INTO
SELF
SUSTAINING
REPRODUCING
LIFE
EVER
IVE
NEVER
BEEN
MUCH
OF
A
PROPHET
THOUGH
I
CANT
EVEN
PICTURE
NEW
YORK
IN
MY
MIND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ANY
TECHNOLOGY
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PRODUCE
THAT
NECESSARY
SPARK
OF
LIFE
DESPITE
HAVING
ALL
OF
THE
PARTS
AVAILABLE
JUST
MY
OPINION
THIS
OPINION
IS
ALSO
CALLED
VITALISM
NAMELY
THAT
LIVING
SYSTEMS
ARE
SOMEHOW
FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
INANIMATE
SYSTEMS
DO
CHRISTIANS
IN
GENERAL
ADOPT
THIS
POSITION
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
WHEN
SCIENTISTS
ANNOUNCE
THEY
HAVE
CREATED
PRIMITIVE
LIFE
SAY
SMALL
BACTERIA
IN
A
LAB
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
YOUR
PROPHECY
ARTIFICIAL
LIFE
HAS
BEEN
CREATED
ALTHOUGH
NOT
YET
IN
A
CHEMICAL
FORM
COMPUTER
SIMULATIONS
OF
EVOLUTION
CONTAIN
SYSTEMS
THAT
ARE
AS
MUCH
ALIVE
AS
ANY
BACTERIUM
ALTHOUGH
THEIR
CODE
IS
ELECTRONIC
AS
WELL
AS
THEIR
METABOLISM
SEE
A
RECENT
BOOK

THE
QUEST
FOR
A
NEW
CREATION
JONATHAN
CAPE
LONDON
ARTIFICIAL
CHEMICAL
LIFE
IS
JUST
AROUND
THE
CORNER
AFTER
ALL
NO
SPARK
OF
LIFE
HAS
BEEN
FOUND
TO
BE
NECESSARY
LIVING
SYSTEMS
DO
NOT
VIOLATE
ANY
PHYSICAL
LAWS
AS
WE
KNOW
THEM
YOU
DONT
MIND
IF
A
FEW
OF
US
SEND
UP
A
PRAYER
ON
YOUR
BEHALF
DURING
YOUR
RESEARCH
DO
YOU
AFTER
ALL
IF
WE
OF
CHRIST
ARE
DELUDING
OURSELVES
YOU
REALLY
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
EH
EXACTLY
THIS
IS
WHY
I
THINK
ATHEISTS
SHOULD
NOT
POST
ANY
EVANGELICAL
ATHEIST
ARGUMENTS
TO
SOCRELIGION
GROUPS
SINCE
PEOPLE
WHO
SEEK
TO
FIND
PEACE
IN
RELIGIONS
MUST
BE
ALLOWED
TO
GATHER
TOGETHER
I
WOULD
NORMALLY
HAVE
ASKED
THESE
QUESTIONS
IN
ALTATHEISM
OR
TALKRELIGIONMISC
BUT
IT
SEEMS
MANY
CHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
READ

GROUPS
