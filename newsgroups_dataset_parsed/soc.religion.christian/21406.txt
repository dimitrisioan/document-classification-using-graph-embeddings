RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
BUT
HAVENT
ALL
SINNED
AND
COME
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
ROMANS
THOSE
THAT
CITE
THIS
SCRIPTURE
TO
CLAIM
THAT
EVEN
BABES
REQUIRE
BAPTISM
NEGLECT
THAT
SIN
IS
NOT
IMPUTED
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
ROMANS
THEREFORE
UNTIL
SOMEONE
IS
CAPABLE
OF
COMPREHENDING
GODS
LAWS
THEY
ARE
NOT
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
LIVING
THEM
THEY
ARE
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
LIFE
AND
ARE
NOT
REMOVED
UNTIL
THEY
CAN
MAKE
A
CONSCIOUS
DECISION
TO
DISOBEY
GOD
A
IDLER
IF
BABIES
ARE
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
BAPTISED
THEN
WHY
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
EVER
SAY
SO
IT
NEVER
COMES
RIGHT
AND
SAYS
ONLY
PEOPLE
THAT
KNOW
RIGHT
FROM
WRONG
OR
WHO
ARE
TAUGHT
CAN
BE
BAPTISED
WHAT
CHRIST
DID
SAY
WAS
I
SOLEMLY
ASSURE
YOU
NO
ONE
CAN
ENTER
GODS
KINGDOM
WITHOUT
BEING
BORN
OF
WATER
AND
SPIRIT
DO
NOT
BE
SURPRISED
THAT
I
TELL
YOU
YOU
MUST
ALL
BE
BEGOTTEN
FROM
ABOVE
COULD
THIS
BE
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
IS
BORN
WITH
ORIGINAL
SIN
