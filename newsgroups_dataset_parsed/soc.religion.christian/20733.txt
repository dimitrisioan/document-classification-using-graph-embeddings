JASON
SMITH
WRITES
ONE
OF
THE
LAWS
OF
NATURE
SPECIFYING
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
SEEMS
TO
DICTATE
AT
LEAST
TO
THIS
LAYMANS
MIND
THERE
MUST
BE
A
CAUSAL
EVENT
NO
REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVE
EXISTS
THE
BIGBANG
MODEL
SUPPOSES
A
TEMPORAL
SINGULARITY
AT
THE
POINT
OF
ORIGIN
THERE
WAS
NO
TIME
FOR
A
PRIOR
CAUSE
TO
OCCUR
IN
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
INVENT
FABLES
FOR
THE
SURROUNDING
CONTEXT
FINE
BUT
ONE
FABLE
IS
ONLY
AS
GOOD
AS
ANY
OTHER
WHY
SHOULD
I
PREFER
TO
BELIEVE
IN
A
GOD
THAT
JUST
EXISTS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
A
SINGULARITY
THAT
JUST
HAPPENED
OR
GIANT
PUCE
SUBSPACE
IGUANAS
THAT
FLING
UNIVERSES
OFF
THEIR
TONGUES
LIKE
GOBS
OF

AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
THE
VERY
LAWS
OF
NATURE
DEMAND
A
WHY
THAT
ISNT
TRUE
OF
SOMETHING
OUTSIDE
OF
NATURE
IE
SUPERNATURAL
I
BELIEVE
THE
GENETIC
CODE
WILL
BE
ENTIRELY
DECIPHERED
IN
OUR
LIFETIMES
BUT
WE
WILL
NOT
SEE
MAN
CONVERT
ENTIRELY
INERT
MATERIAL
INTO
SELF
SUSTAINING
REPRODUCING
LIFE
EVER
IVE
NEVER
BEEN
MUCH
OF
A
PROPHET
THOUGH
I
CANT
EVEN
PICTURE
NEW
YORK
IN
MY
MIND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ANY
TECHNOLOGY
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PRODUCE
THAT
NECESSARY
SPARK
OF
LIFE
DESPITE
HAVING
ALL
OF
THE
PARTS
AVAILABLE
JUST
MY
OPINION
JUST
YOUR
OPINION
AND
UNFORTUNATELY
WRONG
SELF
ASSEMBLING
MOLECULES
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
PRODUCED
ENTIRELY
FROM
INERT
MATTER
AND
HAVE
SPONTANEOUSLY
MUTATED
INTO
A
MORE
RAPIDLY
ASSEMBLING
FORM
ON
EXPOSURE
TO
ULTRAVIOLET

BOTH
ABIOGENESIS
AND
THE
BEGINNINGS
OF

BIOLOGICAL
VITALISM
IS
DEAD
AND
HAS
BEEN
DEAD
FOR
MANY
MANY
YEARS
GIVE
IT
UP
LIFE
IS
NOT
A
SPARK
LIFE
IS
THE
SELFORGANIZATION
OF
SYSTEMS
POISED
BETWEEN
CHAOS
AND

UNTIL
THE
KING
RETURNS
JASON
YOUR
