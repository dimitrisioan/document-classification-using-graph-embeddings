JILL
ANNE
DALEY
WRITES
WHAT
EXACTLY
IS
A
DEFINITION
OF
SIN
AND
WHAT
ARE
SOME
EXAMPLES
HOW
DOES
A
PERSON
KNOW
WHEN
THEY
ARE
COMMITTING
SIN
ANYTHING
THAT
DOES
NOT
BRING
ME
CLOSER
TO
GOD
IS
A
SIN
IF
YOU
THINK
THIS
IS
TOO
STRICT
JUST
CONSIDER
HOW
AMBIGUOUS
IT
IS
THIS
IMPLIES
THAT
STAYING
THE
SAME
IS
A
SIN
A
CHRISTIAN
SHOULD
NEVER
BE
SATISFIED
IT
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THAT
HAVING
FUN
IS
A
SIN
IT
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THAT
SLEEPING
IS
A
SIN
IT
DOES
IMPLY
THAT
I
SIN
EVERY
DAY
A
PERHAPS
SIMPLER
DEFINITION
ANYTHING
THAT
IS
COUNTER
TO
THE
TWO
GREAT
COMMANDMENTS
LOVE
GOD
LOVE
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
IS
A
SIN
ANYTHING
I
DO
THAT
IS
NOT
FROM
LOVE
IS
A
SIN
THE
SAME
ACTION
CAN
BE
A
SIN
SOMETIMES
AND
NOT
A
SIN
SOMETIMES
I
COULD
YELL
AT
MY
KIDS
AS
DISCIPLINE
ALL
THE
TIME
LOVING
THEM
CONSIDERING
ONLY
TO
TEACH
THEM
PROPER
BEHAVIOR
OR
I
COULD
YELL
AT
MY
KIDS
OUT
OF
ANGER
OR
SELFISHNESS
I
COULD
POST
AN
EXCELLENT
ARTICLE
BECAUSE
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
SHARING
MY
OPINIONS
AND
GETTING
FEEDBACK
AND
LEARNING
OR
I
COULD
POST
AN
ARTICLE
BECAUSE
I
WANT
EVERYONE
TO
REALIZE
HOW
WISE
I
AM
