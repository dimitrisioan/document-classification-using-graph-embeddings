greetings
probably
a
tired
old
horse
but
maybe
with
a
slightly
different
twist
i
wanted
to
know
if
there
are
any
good
englishlanguage
texts
for
learning
ancient
hebrew
and
how
these
compare
with
german
educational
texts
qualitywise
if
anybody
has
an
idea
i
cant
figure
out
if
i
should
buy
one
here
for
later
study
or
wait
until
i
get
back
to
the
us
something
i
find
interesting
about
studying
theology
in
germany
is
the
fact
that
the
students
get
their
ancient
languagelearning
out
of
the
way
early
im
not
a
theology
student
but
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
such
folks
in
their
careers
they
take
the
first
two
years
or
so
to
just
do
greek
and
latin
and
hebrew
possibly
aramaic
toowho
knows
whats
it
like
at
divinity
schools
or
seminaries
in
the
states
is
there
a
lot
of
language
instruction
done
i
really
dont
have
a
basis
for
comparison
regards
phil
philip
sells
is
anything
too
hard
for
the
lord
gen
for
better
of
worse
we
dont
have
the
tradition
of
classical
education
in
the
us
so
generally
if
a
seminary
believes
students
should
know
greek
they
have
to
teach
it
its
common
for
seminaries
to
require
at
least
a
semester
each
of
hebrew
and
greek
though
of
course
more
is
required
for
serious
scholarship
