BUT
MAYBE
WITH
A
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
TWIST
I
WANTED
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
GOOD
ENGLISHLANGUAGE
TEXTS
FOR
LEARNING
ANCIENT
HEBREW
AND
HOW
THESE
COMPARE
WITH
GERMAN
EDUCATIONAL
TEXTS
QUALITYWISE
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
AN
IDEA
I
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
IF
I
SHOULD
BUY
ONE
HERE
FOR
LATER
STUDY
OR
WAIT
UNTIL
I
GET
BACK
TO
THE
US
SOMETHING
I
FIND
INTERESTING
ABOUT
STUDYING
THEOLOGY
IN
GERMANY
IS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
STUDENTS
GET
THEIR
ANCIENT
LANGUAGELEARNING
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
EARLY
IM
NOT
A
THEOLOGY
STUDENT
BUT
I
SPEND
A
LOT
OF
TIME
WITH
SUCH
FOLKS
IN
THEIR
CAREERS
THEY
TAKE
THE
FIRST
TWO
YEARS

SO

THERE

TOO
HARD
FOR

GEN
FOR
BETTER
OF
WORSE
WE
DONT
HAVE
THE
TRADITION
OF

EDUCATION
IN

SO
GENERALLY
IF
A
SEMINARY
BELIEVES
STUDENTS
SHOULD
KNOW
GREEK
THEY
HAVE
TO
TEACH
IT
ITS
COMMON
FOR
SEMINARIES
TO
REQUIRE
AT

A
SEMESTER
EACH
OF
HEBREW
AND
GREEK
THOUGH
OF

MORE
IS
REQUIRED
