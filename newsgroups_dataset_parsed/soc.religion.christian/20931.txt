this
is
not
true
the
athiests
position
is
that
there
is
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
god
as
much
as
some
people
accept
their
church
their
priests
or
straight
from
their
own
scriptures
as
the
proof
this
does
not
satisfy
atheists
you
havent
fully
explained
the
atheist
position
many
theists
believe
that
there
is
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
god
but
choose
to
believe
in
him
anyway
i
havent
yet
found
an
argument
for
atheism
that
cant
quickly
be
broken
down
to
unprovable
assumptions
this
isnt
a
problem
with
me
everybody
needs
to
have
a
faith
but
if
you
believe
that
you
can
provide
a
purely
logical
argument
for
the
nonexistence
of
god
id
really
like
to
see
it
are
you
asking
us
to
believe
blindly
you
are
trying
to
deny
that
part
of
us
that
makes
us
ask
the
question
does
god
exist
ie
selfawareness
and
reason
if
we
do
not
use
our
ability
to
reason
we
become
as
ignorant
as
the
other
animals
on
this
earth
does
god
want
us
to
be
like
that
you
are
right
that
science
and
reason
cannot
prove
anything
however
if
we
do
not
use
them
we
can
only
then
believe
on
faith
alone
and
since
we
can
only
use
faith
why
is
one
picture
of
god
eg
hinduism
any
less
valid
than
another
eg
christianity
ahhbut
when
you
use
science
and
reason
you
have
faith
in
certain
beliefs
of
the
scientific
methodfor
example
the
physical
laws
of
the
universe
are
stable
our
observations
of
reality
are
a
valid
basis
for
a
determination
of
truth
objective
reality
exists
logical
argument
is
a
valid
way
to
answer
all
questions
can
you
prove
any
of
these
