in
to
the
details

this
let
me
go

and
tell
you
that
though
it

sound
it
this
is
not
one
of
those
boy
meets
girl
problemat
least
not
totally
like
that
to
meanyway
ok
i
am
a
year
old
sophmore
at
ncsu
about
years
ago
my
family
and
i
were
vacationing
at
the
coast
in
a
cottage
we
rented
across
the
street
was
ths
girl
who
would
whistle
at
me
whenever
she
saw
me
her
name
in
erin
well
we
became
friends
that
week
at
the
beach
and
have
been
writing
each
other
for
about
yearsthere
was
a
period
of
about
years
we
lost
contactbut
that
was
a
while
ago
by
the
wayerin
lives
in
kansas
and
me
in
nc
ok
last
year
in
one
of
her
letters
she
says
that
she
is
coming
back
to
nc
to
see
some
of
her
family
who
are
gonna
be
there
so
i
drove
about
hours
to
see
her
this
is
where
it
beginsi
spent
the
whole
day
with
erinone
of
the
best
days
of
my
life
even
though
we
had
been
writing
each
other
we
still
had
to
get
used
to
being
in
personshe
has
got
to
be
the
most
incredible
woman
i
ever
met
shes
one
year
older
than
me
btw
i
mean
no
person
in
the
world
could
ask
for
a
better
person
not
only
was
she
incredibly
beautiful
not
to
mention
way
out
of
my
leaguealthough
im
not
unattractive
mind
you
but
she
had
a
great
personality
and
a
great
sence
of
humor
her
family
is
one
of
those
families
who
goes
to
church
but
that
is
about
the
extent
of
their
christianityyou
know
the
kind
of
people
but
she
knows
i
am
a
christian
well
you
get
the
idea
of
what
i
think
of
her
if
there
is
ever
such
a
thing
as
love
at
first
sighti
found
it
that
was
last
yeari
kid
you
not
when
i
say
that
i
have
thought
about
her
every
day
since
then
in
out
letters
erin
and
i
always
kid
each
other
about
not
finding
dateswhich
is
true
for
me
but
i
know
it
cant
be
for
her
she
has
had
some
problems
at
home
her
folks
split
up
and
she
ended
up
leaving
schoolnow
we
are
at
the
present
let
me
give
you
part
of
the
letter
i
got
from
her
last
week
okay
now
im
going
to
try
to
explain
my
life
to
you
im
not
going
to
ku
anymore
because
something
just
isnt
right
college
just
wasnt
clicking
with
me
here
greek
life
is
really
big
here
and
that
just
isnt
my
way
i
wasnt
taking
any
classes
that
truly
interested
me
i
really
have
no
idea
of
what
i
want
to
do
with
my
life
i
was
interested
in
something
medical
physical
therpy
i
love
working
with
kids
but
it
just
didnt
work
for
me
at
this
university
and
my
parents
could
tell
so
im
working
full
time
at
the
bass
store
bass
shoes
that
is
and
now
i
have
a
parttime
job
at
a
local
daycare
i
work
in
the
infant
room
mwf
ive
really
enjoyed
it
so
far
it
spices
up
my
week
a
little
bit
and
its
great
experience
as
of
now
im
not
planning
on
going
back
to
school
in
the
very
near
future
the
main
reason
being
my
indecision
on
what
i
want
to
study
but
i
definatley
plan
on
going
back
within
the
next
couple
of
years
where
i
have
no
ideaexcept
for
one
thing
it
wont
be
to
kansas
right
noew
im
discussing
a
promotion
with
my
boss
and
district
manager
it
looks
like
ill
train
at
the
store
i
work
at
now
for
about
months
as
assistant
manager
and
when
thats
done
ill
basically
be
given
a
list
of
stores
newly
or
soon
to
be
built
to
chose
where
i
would
like
to
manage
ive
pretty
much
decided
on
either
one
of
the
carolinas
hopeully
close
to
the
beach
wouldnt
it
be
fun
to
actually
see
each
other
more
than
once
every
few
years
what
do
you
think
abou
that
i
would
like
to
know
your
opinion
this
job
would
pretty
much
be
temporary
but
it
is
very
good
pay
and
any
thye
of
management
experience
would
look
good
on
an
application
or
resume
the
company
is
solid
and
treats
it
employees
very
well
good
benefits
bonuses
medical
plans
plus
after
year
of
fulltime
service
they
will
reimburse
tuition
i
do
have
school
money
waitng
for
me
but
this
will
help
especially
since
i
will
probably
end
up
paying
out
of
state
tuition
wherever
i
go
chris
i
really
would
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
my
decision
i
respect
your
opinion
ive
been
completely
lost
for
what
to
do
for
soooo
long
that
when
the
opportunity
came
along
it
sounded
really
good
i
do
like
my
job
although
im
about
sure
that
i
want
to
do
more
with
my
life
than
reatil
managementbut
it
is
something
i
dont
think
earning
about
a
year
for
a
year
old
female
is
too
bad
anyway
onto
your
career
decisions
ill
solve
your
problem
right
now
marry
me
you
can
do
your
pilot
thing
i
like
to
be
by
myself
sometimes
seriously
or
not
as
seriously
do
what
will
make
you
the
happiest
worry
about
the
home
life
later
ok
well
im
sure
you
see
what
has
got
me
so
uptight
what
do
you
think
she
meant
about
the
marraige
thing
i
dream
at
night
about
marrying
her
and
then
she
mentions
it
in
her
letter
i
dont
know
what
to
think
since
she
wants
to
move
to
the
carolinas
should
i
search
out
a
bass
store
near
here
and
aske
her
to
come
to
carolina
i
always
pick
on
those
people
who
graduate
from
high
school
and
get
marriedbut
what
does
she
mean
ive
had
a
lot
of
stress
lately
with
exams
and
also
the
fact
that
i
dont
date
beacause
no
time
not
that
much
that
most
college
women
are
wrapped
up
in
the
social
scene
with
the
greeks
whic
as
a
christian
i
cant
supportand
here
she
says
she
doesnt
like
the
greek
thing
either
maybe
im
so
stunned
because
there
is
actually
a
girl
that
i
am
so
attracted
to
paying
some
real
attention
to
me
i
mean
what
if
she
did
move
to
ncwhat
would
i
do
im
only
and
she
only
a
sophmore
struggling
through
classes
i
have
prayed
about
this
over
the
past
year
from
time
to
time
saying
god
if
she
is
the
right
one
let
the
situation
open
up
could
this
be
my
sign
i
would
do
anything
to
get
her
to
nchere
is
some
moree
that
makes
it
worse
should
i
call
her
im
terrible
over
the
phone
i
dont
even
like
to
talk
to
my
friends
here
for
longer
than
minutes
i
mean
what
would
a
girl
as
perfect
as
her
want
with
a
very
average
guy
like
me
im
really
confusedi
would
really
appreciate
any
help
i
can
get
thanx
chris
i
have
a
feeling
that
it
might
be
more
appropriate
to
talk
with
chris
directly
via
email
clh
