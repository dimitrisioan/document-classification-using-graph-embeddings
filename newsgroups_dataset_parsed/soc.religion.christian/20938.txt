RE
SABBATH
ADMISSIONS
I
FIND
IT
INTERESTING
THAT
CLS
NEVER
ANSWERED
ANY
OF
THE
QUESTIONS
POSED
THEN
HE
GOES
ON
THE
MAKE
STATEMENTS
WHICH
MAKE
ME
SHUDDER
HE
HAS
ESTABLISHED
A
TWOTIERED
GOD
ONE
SET
OF
RULES
FOR
THE
JEWS
HIS
PEOPLE
AND
ANOTHER
SET
FOR
THE
SAVED
GENTILES
HIS
PEOPLE
WHY
WOULD
GOD
DISCRIMINATE
DOES
THE
JEW
WHO
ACCEPTS
JESUS
NOW
HAVE
TO
LIVE
UNDER
THE
GENTILE
RULES
GOD
HAS
ONE
SET
OF
RULES
FOR
ALL
HIS
PEOPLE
PAUL
WAS
NEVER
AGAINST
THE
LAW
IN
FACT
HE
SAYS
REPEATEDLY
THAT
FAITH
ESTABLISHES
RATHER
THAT
ANNULS
THE
LAW
PAULS
POINT
IS
GERMANE
TO
BOTH
JEWS
AND
GREEKS
THE
LAW
CAN
NEVER
BE
USED
AS
AN
INSTRUMENT
OF
SALVATION
AND
PLEASE
DO
NOT
COMBINE
THE
CEREMONIAL
AND
MORAL
LAWS
IN
ONE
IN
MATT
CHRIST
PLAINLY
SAYS
WHAT
HE
CAME
TO
DO
AND
YOU
SAY
HE
WAS
ONLY
SAYING
THAT
FOR
THE
JEWSS
BENEFIT
YOUR
CHRIST
MUST
BE
A
POLITICIAN
SPEAKING
FROM
BOTH
SIDES
OF
HIS
MOUTH
AS
PAUL
SAID
I
HAVE
NOT
SO
LEARNED
CHRIST
FORGET
ALL
THE
THEOLOGY
JUST
DO
WHAT
JESUS
SAYS
YOUR
EXCUSES
WILL
NOT
HOLD
UP
IN
A
COURT
OF
LAW
ON
EARTH
FAR
LESS
IN
GODS
JUDGEMENT
