RE
HOMOSEXUALITY
ISSUES
IN
CHRISTIANI
HE
IS
HOPING
TO
PASS
A
RESOLUTION
THAT
MORE
OR
LESS
STATES
THAT
WE
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
CHURCH
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
ON
THE
ISSUE
ADMITTING
THAT
BOTH
SIDES
HAVE
HONESTLY
STUDIED
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
HAD
THE
SPIRIT
LEAD
THEM
TO
DIFFERENT
CONCLUSIONS
IT
WORKED
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
THE
ABORTION
ISSUE
THREATENED
TO
DO
MORE
OR
LESS
THE
SAME
THING
AND
HE
IS
HOPEFUL
THAT
THE
GA
CAN
FOSTER
A
LOVING
AND
CARING
ATTITUDE
ABOUT
PEOPLE
WHO
DISAGREE
WITH
THEIR
OWN
VIEW
CLIFF
SLAUGHTERBECK
PEOPLE
WOULD
NOT
BE
WILLING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
WAS
NOT
WILLING
TO
LIVE
WITH
THIS
KIND
OF
COMPROMISE
WITH
ORDINATION
OF
WOMEN
THE
ONE
THING
THAT
WILL
DEFINITELY
PREVENT
A
PERSON
FROM
BECOMING
A
PRESBYTERIAN
MINISTER
IS
IF
THEY
INDICATE
THAT
THEY
DONT
ACCEPT
ORDINATION
OF
WOMEN
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
WE
CANT
HAVE
HALF
THE
CHURCH
NOT
ACCEPTING
THE
LEADERS
OF
THE
OTHER
HALF
MAYBE
PEOPLE
WILL
CLH
IT
MIGHT
BE
INTERESTING
FOR
FOLK
TO
KNOW
THAT
THE
CHURCH
OF
SCOTLAND
ALSO
A
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH
MANAGED
TO
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
OVER
WOMENS
ORDINATION
FOR
YEARS
THE
REASONING
WAS
THAT
CONGREGATIONS
ARE
FREE
TO
CALL
WHOEVER
THEY
WISH
AND
THAT
MINISTERS
AND
SESSIONS
CHOOSE
ELDERS
IF
A
CONGREGATION
DID
NOT
WISH
TO
HAVE
A
WOMAN
THEY
WERE
NOT
OBLIGED
TO
AND
IF
A
SESSION
DID
NOT
WISH
TO
THEY
COULD
NOT
BE
FORCED
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
WHO
ISSUE
OF
FREEDOM
TO
CALL
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
CONGREGATION
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
HERE
THIS
YEAR
IS
THE
ANNIVARSARY
OF
THE
DISRUPTION
WHERE
THE
CHURCH
SPLIT
ON
THAT
VERY
ISSUE
THEY
DIDNT
GET
BACK
TOGETHER
FOR
ALMOST
YEARS
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AGO
ON
THE
ANNIVERSARY
OF
THE
ALLOWING
OF
WOMENS
ORDINATION
THE
POSITION
WAS
CHANGED
SO
THAT
IN
THEORY
ALL
MINISTERS
AND
ELDERS
MUST
RECOGNISE
THAT
WOMEN
CAN
BE
ORDAINED
IN
THEORY
A
MINISTER
WHO
REFUSED
TO
ORDAIN
A
WOMAN
TO
HIS
SESSION
OR
REFUSED
TO
WORK
WITH
A
WOMAN
MINISTER
IN
PRESBYTERY
COULD
BE
DISCIPLINED
IN
PRACTICE
THIS
HAS
NOT
HAPPENED
AND
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
HAPPEN
MY
PERSONAL
VIEW
IS
THAT
THE
NEW
LEGISLATION
WAS
A
MISTAKE
AND
THAT
THE
PERMISSIVE
BUT
NOT
PRESCRIPTIVE
LEGISLATION
WORKED
VERY
WELL
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
START
GOING
ROUND
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
DEBATE
AT
NEXT
YEARS
ASSEMBLY
AT
THIS
YEARS
A
MOTION
WAS
PUT
TO
BAN
THE
BLESSING
OF
SAMESEX
COUPLES
AFTER
AN
EDINBURGH
MINISTER
DID
SO
OUR
PANEL
ON
DOCTRINE
IS
CURRENTLY
LOOKING
AT
MARRIAGE
AND
WILL
REPORT
NEXT
YEAR
THE
MATTER
WILL
BE
CONSIDERED
AND
DEBATED
THEN
HOPE
THIS
IS
INTERESTING
ALISON
