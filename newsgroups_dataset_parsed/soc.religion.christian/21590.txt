HE
CAN
ESPECIALLY
HOMOSEXUALITY
LETS
REACH
THE
HOMOSEXUALS
FOR
CHRIST
LETS
NOT
TRY
TO
CHANGE
THEM
JUST
NEED
TO
BRING
THEM
TO
CHRIST
IF
HE
DOESNT
WANT
THEM
TO
BE
GAY
HE
CAN
CHANGE
THAT
DONT
HATE
THE
PEOPLE
I
DONT
I
DONT
HATE
MY
KIDS
WHEN
THEY
DO
WRONG
EITHER
BUT
I
TELL
THEM
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
AND
IF
THEY
LIE
OR
DONT
ADMIT
THEY
ARE
WRONG
OR
JUST
DONT
MAKE
AN
EFFORT
TO
IMPROVE
OR
REPENT
THEY
GET
PUNISHED
I
THINK
THIS
IS
QUITE
APPROPRIATE
NOTE
THE
DIFFERENCE
HERE
ONE
IS
SAYING
IF
CHRIST
DISAGREES
WITH
A
CHRISTIAN
BEING
GAY
CHRIST
CAN
CHANGE
THAT
THE
OTHER
IS
SAYING
IF
I
THINK
BEING
GAY
IS
WRONG
THAT
A
CHRISTIAN
CANNOT
BE
GAY
I
NEED
TO
TELL
THEM
TO
CHANGE
AS
LOIS
SAID
AND
AS
BEFORE
