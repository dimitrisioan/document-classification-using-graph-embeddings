OFM
REPLIES
TO
A
QUESTION
ON
THE
MULTIPLICITY
OF
TRANSLATIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
NO
CHRISTIANS
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
PROCESS
OF
COPYING
MANUSCRIPTS
OR
THE
PROCESS
OF
TRANSLATING
IS
FREE
OF
ERROR
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
ISNT
TRUE
ON
ANOTHER
NEWS
GROUP
EARLIER
THIS
YEAR
SOMEONE
POSTED
THAT
THE
KING
JAMES
BIBLE
WAS
THE
DIVINELY
INSPIRED
VERSION
OF
THE
BIBLE
IN
ENGLISH
AND
WAS
THEREFORE
INERRANT
ALL
OTHER
ENGLISH
TRANSLATIONS
WERE
FROM
SATAN
TRYING
TO
DECEIVE
THE
BODY
OF
CHRIST
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THE
PASTOR
OF
A
CHURCH
I
WAS
ATTENDING
SHOWED
ME
A
POSTER
ADVERTISING
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
A
CERTAIN
MAN
TO
ADDRESS
CONGREGATIONS
VERY
PROMINANTLY
ON
THE
POSTER
WAS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
MAN
USED
ONLY
THE
KJV
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
KJV
IS
THE
ENGLISH
BIBLE
IS
MORE
PREVALENT
THAN
MANY
MIGHT
THINK
SCOTT
AT
BRANDEIS
BUT
GOD
DEMONSTRATES
HIS
THE
LORD
BLESS
YOU
AND
KEEP
YOU
OWN
LOVE
FOR
US
IN
THAT
THE
LORD
MAKE
HIS
FACE
SHINE
ON
YOU
WHILE
WE
WERE
YET
SINNERS
AND
BE
GRACIOUS
TO
YOU
CHRIST
DIED
FOR
US
THE
LORD
LIFT
UP
HIS
COUNTENANCE
ON
YOU
AND
GIVE
YOU
PEACE
