WRITES
WHEN
I
DO
PROGRAMS
I
SPEND
ABOUT
HALF
THE
TIME
TALKING
ABOUT
ABSITINENCE
I
FIND
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
OBJECT
TO
SEX
EDUCATION
ACTUALLY
OBJECT
TO
THE
TEACHING
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
ABSTINENCNE
AND
THAT
IMO
IS
JUST
AS
IRRESPONSIBLE
AS
ONLY
TALKING
ABOUT
COMDOM
USE
IM
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
MOST
SEX
ED
INSTRUCTORS
ANDOR
POLICY
MAKERS
ACTUALLY
OBJECT
TO
MAKING
ANY
MORE
THAN
A
PASSING
REFERENCE
TO
ABSTINENCE
WISHING
TO
SPEND
TIME
ONLY
ON
THE
REALISTIC
CHOICES
IN
THE
SEX
ED
PORTION
OF
THE
HIGH
SCHOOL
HEALTH
COURSE
I
TOOK
IN
IT
WAS
IMPRESSED
THAT
THE
ONLY
POSITIVE
WAY
TO
NOT
GET
PREGNANT
WAS
TO
NOT
HAVE
SEX
OTHER
METHODS
OF
CONTRACEPTION
WERE
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
FRAMEWORK
OF
A
CHART
WHICH
SHOWED
BOTH
THE
EXPECTED
FAILURE
RATE
THEORETICAL
ASSUMES
NO
MISTAKES
AND
THE
ACTUAL
FAILURE
RATE
BASED
ON
RESEARCH
TOP
OF
THE
CHART
WAS
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
METHOD
EXPECTED
ACTUAL
FAILURE
RATE
FAILURE
RATE
ABSTINENCE
AND
NFP
NATURAL
FAMILY
PLANNING
WAS
ON
THE
BOTTOM
THE
TEACHER
EVEN
SAID
IVE
HAD
SOME
STUDENTS
TELL
ME
THAT
THEY
CANT
USE
ANYTHING
FOR
BIRTH
CONTROL
BECAUSE
THEYRE
CATHOLIC
WELL
IF
YOURE
NOT
MARRIED
AND
YOURE
A
PRACTICING
CATHOLIC
THE
TOP
OF
THE
LIST
IS
YOUR
SLOT
NOT
THE
BOTTOM
EVEN
IF
YOURE
NOT
RELIGIOUS
THE
TOP
OF
THE
LIST
IS
SAFEST
YES
THIS
WAS
A
PUBLIC
SCHOOL

AFTER
