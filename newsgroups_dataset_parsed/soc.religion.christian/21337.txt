RE
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
BIBLE
SODIUMASCSLBCOMASCSLBCOM
MICHAEL
A
MONTGOMERY
WRITES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
GOD
HAS
PRESERVED
THE
BIBLE
PERFECTLY
IN
THAT
IT
PERFECTLY
CONVEYS
ALL
OF
THE
TRUTH
THAT
HE
INTENDED
THIS
HE
HAS
DONE
OH
YEA
WHICH
VERSION
OF
THE
BIBLE
IS
THE
PERFECTLY
PRESERVED
ONE
AND
WHY
ARE
THERE
SO
MANY
TRANSLATIONS
THAT
ARE
NOT
PERFECTLY
PRESERVED
IS
GOD
TRYING
TO
CONFUSE
US
MINOR
CHANGES
IN
WORDING
OR
EVEN
ACCIDENTAL
OMISSION
OF
PASSAGES
IN
SOME
MANUSCRIPTS
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
THE
TRUTH
BEING
CONVEYED
NOR
WOULD
IT
LEAD
A
SERIOUS
STUDENT
INTO
DOCTRINAL
ERROR
NOTE
ALSO
THAT
GOD
PROVIDED
MANY
BUT
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
HAPPEND
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
BRANCHES
OF
DENOMINATIONS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AND
DEVIATIONS
OF
DOCTRINE
PORTRUDING
FROM
VARYING
TRANSLATIONS
OF
BIBLICAL
TEXTS
BY
SERIOUS
STUDENTS
THAT
ARE
MUCH
TOO
NUMEROUS
TO
BEGIN
TO
COUNT
IF
THERE
IS
A
PERFECT
BIBLE
THEN
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
POSSIBLE
MISINTERPRETATION
AND
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
NEED
FOR
ANYONE
HERE
TO
BE
DEBATING
IT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
MAYBE
THE
BIBLE
IS
PERFECT
BUT
NO
ONE
ON
THIS
PLANET
IS
PERFECT
ENOUGH
TO
READ
IT
CORRECTLY
BUT
THEN
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
POINT
IN
GOD
GIVING
US
SOMETHING
WE
CANNOT
USE
CORRECTLY
IN
SHORT
IF
YOU
ATTACK
THE
CREDIBILITY
AND
RELIABILITY
OF
THE
BIBLE
YOU
ARE
ON
WEAK
GROUND
FURTHERMORE
THE
ONLY
REASON
THAT
I
CAN
SEE
FOR
WANTING
TO
DO
SO
IS
TO
REMOVE
THE
BIBLE
AS
THE
FINAL
AUTHORITY
AND
INSTEAD
PUT
THAT
RESPONSIBILITY
ON
MEN
TO
SIFT
THE
BIBLE
TO
STRAIN
OUT
THE
NUGGETS
OF
TRUTH
THAT
IT
CONTAINS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
BELIEVE
AND
IGNORE
THE
REST
THE
BIBLE
IS
TRUTH
IT
DOES
NOT
JUST
CONTAIN
TRUTH
IMHO
IF
YOU
TRUST
YOUR
SALVATION
ON
THE
RELIABILITY
OF
A
SINGLE
BOOK
YOU
ARE
ON
WEAK
GROUND
REMEMBER
IN
THE
BEGINNING
WAS
THE
WORD
AND
THE
WORD
WAS
WITH
GOD
AND
THE
WORD
WAS
GOD
THIS
WORD
EXISTED
BEFORE
THE
BIBLE
WAS
WRITTEN
NOTE
WORD
GOD
THIS
WORD
THAT
JOHN
IS
TRYING
TO
DESCRIBE
CANNOT
BE
FULLY
DESCRIBED
IN
ANY
WRITTEN
LANGUAGE
ALL
LANGUAGES
BEING
IMPERFECT
REALIZATION
COMES
ONLY
FROM
CONTEMPLATION
OF
THE
WORD
AND
IS
OUTSIDE
THE
BOUNDARIES
OF
LANGUAGE
I
USE
THE
BIBLE
AS
A
GUIDE
A
STEPPING
STONE
BUT
IN
NO
WAY
IS
IT
MY
FINAL
AUTHORITY
GOD
ALONE
IS
THE
FINAL
AUTHORITY
