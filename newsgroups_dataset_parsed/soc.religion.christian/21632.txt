RE
BAPTISM
REQUIRES
FAITH
AARON
BRYCE
CARDENAS
WRITES
ROMANS
BUT
NOT
ALL
THE
ISRAELITES
ACCEPTED
THE
GOOD
NEWS
FOR
ISAIAH
SAYS
LORD
WHO
HAS
BELIEVED
OUR
MESSAGE
CONSEQUENTLY
FAITH
COMES
FROM
HEARING
THE
MESSAGE
AND
THE
MESSAGE
IS
HEARD
THROUGH
THE
WORD
OF
CHRIST
SO
THEN
WE
RECEIVE
GODS
GIFT
OF
FAITH
TO
US
AS
WE
HEAR
THE
MESSAGE
OF
THE
GOSPEL
FAITH
IS
A
POSSIBLE
RESPONSE
TO
HEARING
GODS
WORD
PREACHED
KIDS
ARE
NOT
YET
SPIRITUALLY
INTELLECTUALLY
OR
EMOTIONALLY
MATURE
ENOUGH
TO
RESPOND
TO
GODS
WORD
HENCE
THEY
CANNOT
HAVE
FAITH
AND
THEREFORE
CANNOT
BE
RAISED
IN
BAPTISM
TO
A
NEW
LIFE
CATHOLICS
VIEW
THE
EFFECTS
OF
BAPTISM
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENTLY
AND
THATS
ONE
PRIMARY
REASON
WHY
THEY
BAPTIZE
BABIES
THEY
BELIEVE
THAT
BAPTISM
PRODUCES
A
CHANGE
IN
THE
SOUL
OF
THE
BABY
QUITE
INDEPENDENTLY
OF
ANY
VOLITIONAL
ACT
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
BABY
THIS
CHANGE
IN
THE
BABYS
SOUL
GIVES
THE
INFANT
CERTAIN
CAPABILITIES
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
WITHOUT
BAPTISM
SINCE
THE
INFANT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
USE
OF
HIS
INTELLECT
AND
WILL
YET
THESE
NEW
FACULTIES
ARE
DORMANT
BUT
AS
THE
CHILD
GETS
OLDER
THE
GIFTS
OF
BAPTISM
COME
MORE
AND
MORE
INTO
PLAY
EZEKIEL
THE
SOUL
WHO
SINS
WILL
DIE
THE
SON
WILL
NOT
SHARE
THE
GUILT
OF
THE
FATHER
NOR
WILL
THE
FATHER
SHARE
THE
GUILT
OF
THE
SON
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS
MAN
WILL
BE
CREDITED
TO
HIM
AND
THE
WICKEDNESS
OF
THE
WICKED
WILL
BE
CHARGED
AGAINST
HIM
IF
YOU
READ
ALL
OF
EZEKIEL
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
GOD
DOESNT
HOLD
US
GUILTY
FOR
ANYONE
ELSES
SINS
SO
WE
CAN
HAVE
NO
ORIGINAL
GUILT
FROM
ADAM
ADAM
WAS
GIVEN
A
NUMBER
OF
GIFTS
BY
GOD
THE
CHIEF
AMONG
THEM
WAS
WHAT
CATHOLICS
CALL
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
THE
WORD
USED
FOR
THIS
IS
CHARITY
BY
HIS
SIN
ADAM
LOST
THIS
GRACE
HE
DIDNT
LOSE
IT
JUST
FOR
HIMSELF
HOWEVER
HE
LOST
IT
FOR
THE
WHOLE
HUMAN
RACE
BECAUSE
ONCE
HE
LOST
IT
HE
COULDNT
PASS
IT
ON
TO
HIS
DESCENDENTS
THATS
WHY
CATHOLICS
BAPTIZE
BABIES
THROUGH
HIS
ORIGINAL
SIN
ADAM
LOST
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
FOR
ALL
HIS
DESCENDENTS
CHRIST
INSTITUTED
BAPTISM
TO
GIVE
IT
BACK
TO
EVERYONE
BABIES
ARE
NOT
BEING
PUNISHED
FOR
ANYTHING
THEY
PERSONALLY
DID
THEY
ARE
SIMPLY
LACKING
IN
SOMETHING
THEY
NEED
IN
ORDER
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
