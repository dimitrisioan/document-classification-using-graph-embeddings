A

THE
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
OF
PREDESTINATION
DOES
NOT
EXCLUDE
FREE
WILL
IN
ANY
WAY
SINCE
GOD
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
HE
THEREFORE
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
THAT
IS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
TO
US
WE
HAVE
FREE
WILL
AND
ARE
ABLE
TO
CHANGE
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
US
HOWEVER
SINCE
GOD
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
HE
KNOWS
ALL
THE
CHOICES
WE
WILL
MAKE
IN
ADVANCE
GOD
IS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
TIME
TOO
OFTEN
ARGUMENTS
PIT
PREDESTINATION
AGAINST
FREE
WILL
WE
BELIEVE
IN
BOTH
JUST
A
LITTLE
ISSUE
