i
am
interested
in
finding
out
why
people
become
atheists
after
having
believed
in
some
godgod
in
conversing
with
them
on
other
groups
ive
often
sensed
anger
or
hostility
though
i
dont
mean
to
imply
that
all
atheists
are
angry
or
hostile
it
does
seem
to
be
one
motivation
for
giving
up
faith
thus
some
atheism
might
result
from
brokenness
this
is
condescending
at
best
and
a
slightly
disquised
ad
hominem
attack
this
attitude
on
the
part
of
many
theists
especially
the
vocal
ones
is
one
reason
for
the
hostility
you
sense
how
do
you
like
it
when
atheists
say
that
people
turn
to
religion
out
of
immature
emotionalism
i
wouldnt
and
dont
i
thought
i
did
a
pretty
good
job
of
qualifying
my
statement
but
apparently
some
people
misinterpreted
my
intentions
i
apologize
for
my
part
in
communicating
any
confusion
my
intent
was
more
to
stir
up
discussion
rather
than
judge
it
seems
to
have
worked
rest
of
post
noted
by
the
way
i
did
not
originally
post
this
to
altatheism
if
it
got
there
i
dont
know
how
it
did
