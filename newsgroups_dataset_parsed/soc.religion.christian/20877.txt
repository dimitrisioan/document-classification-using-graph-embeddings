AM
I
GOING
TO
HELL
I
HAVE
STATED
BEFORE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
MYSELF
AN
ATHEIST
BUT
DEFINITELY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
COMBINED
WITH
A
POST
TO
ANOTHER
GROUP
TO
THE
EFFECT
OF
YOU
WILL
ALL
GO
TO
HELL
HAS
ME
INTERESTED
IN
THE
CONSENSUS
AS
TO
HOW
A
GOD
MIGHT
JUDGE
MEN
AS
A
CATHOLIC
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
A
JEW
BUDDHIST
ETC
MIGHT
GO
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
OBVIOUSLY
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THIS
EVEN
MORE
SEE
ATHEISTS
AND
PAGANS
I
ASSUME
I
WOULD
BE
LUMPED
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
TO
BE
HELLBOUND
I
KNOW
YOU
BELIEVE
ONLY
GOD
CAN
JUDGE
AND
I
DO
NOT
ASK
YOU
TO
JUST
FOR
YOUR
OPINIONS
THANKS
TIM
