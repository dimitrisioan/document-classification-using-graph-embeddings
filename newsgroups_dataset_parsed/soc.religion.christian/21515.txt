ARE
ALL
FROM

IN

THERE
IS
A
PASSAGE
THAT
PRESUPPOSES
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
AN
EVIL
NOTE
THAT
THE
PASSAGE
ISNT
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALITY

IDOLATRY
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
VISITED
ON
PEOPLE
AS
A
PUNISHMENT
OR
AT
LEAST
RESULT
OF
IDOLATRY
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
ARGUMENTS
OVER
THIS
PASSAGE
IT
DOES
NOT
USE
THE
WORD
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
IT
IS
REFERRING
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE

LIKE
SAYING
THAT
MURDER
IS
ONLY
WRONG
FOR
THOSE

AND
STEALING
IS
ONLY
WRONG
FOR
THOSE
