RE
ATHEISTS
VIEWS
ON
CHRISTIANITY
WAS
RE
ACCEPTING
JEESUS
IN
YOUR
HEART
NORRISATHENAMITEDU
WRITES
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
A
VALID
OBJECTION
TO
RELIGIONASEXPLANATIONOF
NATURE
FORTUNATELY
FOR
THE
CONVENIENCE
OF
US
BELIEVERS
THERE
IS
A
CLASS
OF
QUESTIONS
THAT
CAN
NEVER
BE
REDUCED
AWAY
BY
NATURAL
SCIENCE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
MUST
THERE
BE
A
WHY
TO
THIS
I
ASK
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
YOU
ALSO
ASSUME
ABOUT
GOD
NAMELY
THAT
HE
JUST
EXISTS
WITH
NO
WHY
TO
HIS
EXISTENCE
SO
THE
QUESTION
IS
REVERSED
WHY
CANT
WE
ASSUME
THE
UNIVERSE
JUST
EXISTS
AS
YOU
ASSUME
GOD
TO
JUST
EXIST
WHY
MUST
THERE
BE
A
WHY
TO
THE
UNIVERSE
AFTER
ALL
THE
TIMESPACE
WORLD
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
EXIST
WHY
DOES
ANYTHING
EXIST
AND
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
PERSONS
EG
MAN
TO
COME
INTO
BEING
OUT
OF
A
PURELY
IMPERSONAL
COSMOS
THESE
QUESTIONS
WHICH
LOOK
AT
THE
REAL
MYSTERIES
OF
LIFE
THE
CREATION
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
OF
PERSONS
PROVIDE
A
PERMANENT
INDICATOR
THAT
THE
MEANING
OF
LIFE
IN
THE
MATERIAL
WORLD
CAN
ONLY
BE
FOUND
OUTSIDE
THAT
WORLD
IN
ITS
SOURCE
IT
MAY
BE
THAT
ONE
DAY
MAN
NOT
ONLY
CAN
CREATE
LIFE
BUT
CAN
ALSO
CREATE
MAN
NOW
I
DONT
SEE
THIS
HAPPENING
IN
MY
LIFETIME
NOR
DO
I
ASSERT
IT
IS
PROBABLE
BUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
IS
THERE
GIVEN
SCIENTISTS
ARE
WORKING
HARD
AT
DECODING
OUT
GENETIC
CODE
TO
PERHAPS
HELP
CURE
DISEASE
OF
A
GENETIC
VARIATION
AGAIN
THOUGH
MUST
THERE
BE
WHY
OR
A
DIVINE
PRUPOSE
TO
MANS
EXISTENCE
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
MAN
IS
ONLY
AN
ANIMAL
I
HAVE
TO
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
PRESENTING
AN
UNPROVABLE
STATEMENT
A
DOGMA
IF
YOU
WILL
AND
ONE
THE
REQUIRES
A
KIND
OF
FAITH
TOO
BY
TAKING
SUCH
A
HARD
LINE
IN
YOUR
ATHEISM
YOU
MAY
HAVE
STUMBLED
INTO
A
RELIGION
OF
YOUR
OWN
AS
FAR
AS
WE
CAN
TELL
MAN
FALLS
INTO
THE
MAMMAL
CATAGORY
NOW
IF
THERE
WERE
SOMETHING
MORE
TO
THE
MAN
SAY
A
SOUL
THEN
WE
HAVE
YET
TO
FIND
EVIDENCE
OF
SUCH
BUT
AS
IT
IS
NOW
MAN
IS
A
MAMMAL
BABIES
ARE
BORN
LIVE
MOTHER
GIVES
MILK
WERE
WARMBLOODED
ETC
AS
OTHER
MAMMALS
ARE
AND
IS
SIMILAR
IN
GENETIC
CONSTRUCTION
TO
SOME
OF
THEM
IN
PARTICULAR
PRIMATES
FOR
MORE
ON
THIS
CHECK
OUT
TALKORIGINS
BUT
BEFORE
YOU
WRITE
OFF
ALL
CHRISTIANITY
AS
PHONY
AND
SHALLOW
I
HOPE
YOULL
DO
A
LITTLE
RESEARCH
INTO
ITS
HISTORY
AND
VARIETIES
PERHAPS
BY
READING
PAUL
JOHNSONS
A
HISTORY
OF
CHRISTIANITY
FROM
YOUR
REMARKS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
EXPOSED
TO
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
CHRISTIAN
RELIGION
AND
NOT
OTHERS
EVEN
AN
ATHEIST
SHOULD
HAVE
ENOUGH
FAITH
IN
MAN
TO
KNOW
THAT
A
MOVEMENT
OF
YEARS
HAS
TO
HAVE
SOME
DEPTH
AND
BE
ANIMATED
BY
SOME
ENDURING
VALUES
WELL
THEN
BUDDHISM
CONFUCIANISM
TAOISM
HINDUISM
JUDAISM
ZOERASTERISM
SHINTOISM
AND
ISLAM
SHOULD
FIT
THIS
BIT
OF
LOGIC
QUITE
NICELY
ALL
HAVE
DEPTH
ALL
HAVE
ENDURING
VALUES
THUS
ALL
MUST
BE
TRUE
