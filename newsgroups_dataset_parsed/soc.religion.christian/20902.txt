RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
A
PREVIOUS
ARTICLE
SAYS
IN
ARTICLE
MARK
BAKER
WRITES
TO
DEMAND
SCINTIFIC
OR
RATIONAL
PROOF
OF
GODS
EXISTENCE
IS
TO
DENY
GODS
EXISTENCE
SINCE
NEITHER
SCIENCE
NOR
REASON
CAN
IN
THEIR
VERY
NATURE
PROVE
ANYTHING
ARE
YOU
ASKING
US
TO
BELIEVE
BLINDLY
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
DENY
THAT
PART
OF
US
THAT
MAKES
US
ASK
THE
QUESTION
DOES
GOD
EXIST
IE
SELFAWARENESS
AND
REASON
IF
WE
DO
NOT
USE
OUR
ABILITY
TO
REASON
WE
BECOME
AS
IGNORANT
AS
THE
OTHER
ANIMALS
ON
THIS
EARTH
DOES
GOD
WANT
US
TO
BE
LIKE
THAT
I
AM
ASKING
YOU
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THINGS
NOT
VISIBLE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
BELIEVEING
BLINDLY
OR
NOT
IM
NOT
SURE
HOW
BLINDNESS
COMES
INTO
IT
I
DO
NOT
DENY
REASON
INDEED
I
INSIST
UPON
IT
BUT
REASON
ONLY
DRAWS
CONCLUSIONS
FROM
EVIDENCE
IF
YOU
DECIDE
IN
ADVANCE
THAT
YOUR
REASON
WILL
ACT
ONLY
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
FIVE
PHYSICAL
SENSES
THEN
YOU
CUT
REASON
OFF
FROM
ANY
POSSIBILITY
OF
REACHING
A
CONCLUSION
OUTSIDE
THE
PHYSICAL
SPHERE
BEYOND
THE
RATHER
PROVOCATIVE
IF
INCONCLUSIVE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
PHYSICAL
SPHERE
IS
NOT
SELF
EXPLANATORY
CHRISTIANS
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
HAVE
RECEIVED
A
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
EVIDENCE
WHICH
THEY
CALL
FAITH
AND
WHICH
IS
A
GIFT
OF
GOD
THAT
IS
THIS
EVIDENCE
IS
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
A
THING
WHICH
CHOOSES
TO
REVEAL
OR
HIDE
ITSELF
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
SENSES
CANNOT
TELL
YOU
IS
SUCH
A
TING
EXISTS
REASONING
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
SENSES
WONT
HELP
EITHER
BUT
CHRISTIANS
DO
REASON
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
FAITH
AND
DO
CLAIM
THAT
THIS
EVIDENCE
IS
WHOLLY
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
OTHER
SENSES
AND
INDEED
THAT
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THESE
OTHER
SENSES
IS
PART
OF
GODS
REVELATION
OF
HIMSELF
TO
US
IT
IS
NOT
NECESSARILLY
THE
CASE
HOWEVER
THAT
KNOWLEDGE
OF
A
GOD
MUST
COME
THROUGH
THIS
ROUTE
THERE
MAY
BE
OTHER
SENSES
THAN
THE
PHYSICAL
ONES
PROVIDING
EVIDENCE
OF
NONPHYSICAL
REALITIES
THERE
MAY
OF
COURSE
BE
PHYSICAL
REALITIES
OF
A
TYPE
FOR
WHICH
WE
HAVE
NO
CORRESPONDING
SENSES
FOR
ALL
WE
KNOW
THESE
SENSES
IF
THEY
EXIST
MAY
PROVIDE
VALID
EVIDENCE
FOR
REASON
TO
WORK
ON
AND
AS
WITH
ALL
SENSES
THESE
SENSES
MAY
BE
IMPAIRED
IN
SOME
PEOPLE
THAT
IS
THEY
MAY
BE
SPIRITUALLY
BLIND
IN
THIS
SENSE
BELIEF
IN
GOD
BECOMES
AN
ACT
OF
SIGHT
AND
IT
IS
DISBELIEF
WHICH
IS
BLIND
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
THAT
SCIENCE
AND
REASON
CANNOT
PROVE
ANYTHING
HOWEVER
IF
WE
DO
NOT
USE
THEM
WE
CAN
ONLY
THEN
BELIEVE
ON
FAITH
ALONE
AND
SINCE
WE
CAN
ONLY
USE
FAITH
WHY
IS
ONE
PICTURE
OF
GOD
EG
HINDUISM
ANY
LESS
VALID
THAN
ANOTHER
EG
CHRISTIANITY
FAITH
AS
I
HAVE
SAID
IS
NOT
OPPOSED
TO
REASON
IT
IS
SIMPLY
A
NEW
SOURCE
OF
EVIDENCE
ON
WHICH
REASON
MAY
OPERATE
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
HUMAN
BEINGS
HAVE
MANY
SYSTEMS
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
SENSES
AND
SIMILARLY
THERE
ARE
MANY
SYSTEMS
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
EVIDENCE
PROVIDED
BY
FAITH
RELIGIOUS
BELIEVERS
IN
GENERAL
AND
CHRISTIANS
IN
PARTICULAR
USE
REASON
TO
HELP
SIFT
THROUGH
THE
EVIDENCE
TO
COME
TO
A
CLEARER
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
PROVIDED
BY
FAITH
SCIENCE
CLAIMS
WITH
GOOD
REASON
TO
BE
THE
MOST
VALID
SYSTEM
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
AND
CHRISTIANITY
CLAIMS
ALSO
WITH
GOOD
REASON
TO
BE
THE
MOST
VALID
SYSTEM
POSSESSED
OF
THE
BEST
EVIDENCE
FOR
EXPLAINING
GODS
REVELATIONS
OF
HIMSELF
TO
MAN
IF
YOU
DOUBT
THAT
CHRISTIANS
USE
REASON
READ
THIS
NEWSGROUP
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
YOU
WILL
SEE
RATIONAL
DEBATE
APLENTY
MARK
BAKER
THE
TASK
IS
NOT
TO
CUT
DOWN
JUNGLES
BUT
TO
IRRIGATE
DESERTS
