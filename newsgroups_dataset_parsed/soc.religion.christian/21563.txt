LETS
TALK
ABOUT
PRINCIPLES
IF
WE
ACCEPT
THAT
GOD
SETS
THE
STANDARDS
FOR
WHAT
OUGHT
TO
BE
INCLUDED
IN
SCRIPTURE
THEN
WE
CAN
ASK
IS
IT
AUTHORITATIVE
AUTHORITATIVE
IS
NOT
A
QUALITY
OF
THE
WRITING
ITSELF
IT
IS
A
STATEMENT
BY
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
FAITH
WHETHER
IT
WILL
ACCEPT
THE
WRITING
AS
NORMATIVE
IS
IT
PROPHETIC
HOW
IS
PROPHECY
TO
BE
DEFINED
IF
IT
IS
SPEAKING
FORTH
OF
GODS
MESSAGE
MUCH
OF
THE
APOCRYPHA
MUST
SURELY
QUALIFY
IS
IT
AUTHENTIC
AGAIN
BY
WHAT
STANDARD
IS
AUTHENTICITY
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
AUTHORS
THE
HISTORICAL
ACCURACY
IS
IT
DYNAMIC
WHAT
IS
THIS
SUPPOSED
TO
MEAN
MANY
OF
THE
APOCRYPHAL
BOOKS
ARE
HIGHLY
DYNAMIC
THOUGHT
PROVOKING
FAITHFUL
EVEN
EXCITING
IS
IT
RECEIVED
COLLECTED
READ
AND
USED
BY
WHOM
OF
COURSE
THE
APOCRYPHAL
BOOKS
WERE
RECEIVED
BY
SOME
COLLECTED
OR
ELSE
WE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
THEM
READ
AND
USED
AND
THEY
STILL
ARE
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
AND
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
ON
THESE
COUNTS
THE
APOCRAPHA
FALLS
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
THIS
IS
DEMONSTRABLY
FALSE
TO
QUOTE
UNGERS
BIBLE
DICTIONARY
ON
THE
APOCRAPHA
THEY
ABOUND
IN
HISTORICAL
AND
GEOGRAPHICAL
INACCURACIES
AND
ANACHRONISMS
SO
DO
OTHER
BOOKS
OF
THE
BIBLE
THEY
TEACH
DOCTRINES
WHICH
ARE
FALSE
AND
FOSTER
PRACTICES
WHICH
ARE
AT
VARIANCE
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
FALSE
BY
WHOSE
INTERPRETATION
THOSE
CHURCHES
THAT
ACCEPT
THEM
FIND
NO
CONTRADICTION
WITH
THE
REST
OF
SCRIPTURE
THEY
RESORT
TO
LITERARY
TYPES
AND
DISPLAY
AN
ARTIFICIALITY
OF
SUBJECT
MATTER
AND
STYLING
OUT
OF
KEEPING
WITH
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
THIS
IS
A
PURELY
SUBJECTIVE
EVALUATION
THE
APOCRYPHAL
BOOKS
DEMONSTRATE
THE
SAME
CATEGORIES
AND
FORMS
OF
WRITING
FOUND
IN
THE
OTHER
SCRIPTURES
IN
FACT
ONE
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
THE
APOCRYPHAL
ADDITIONS
TO
THE
BOOK
OF
ESTHER
ACT
RATHER
TO
BRING
THE
UNSCRIPTURELIKE
BOOK
OF
ESTHER
MORE
INTO
LINE
WITH
OTHER
BOOKS
THEY
LACK
THE
DISTINCTIVE
ELEMENTS
WHICH
GIVE
GENUINE
SCRIPTURE
THEIR
DIVINE
CHARACTER
SUCH
AS
PROPHETIC
POWER
AND
POETIC
AND
RELIGIOUS
FEELING
HAVE
YOU
EVER
READ
THE
WISDOM
OF
BEN
SIRA
OR
THE
WISDOM
OF
SOLOMON
THEY
EXHIBIT
EVERY
BIT
AS
MUCH
POETIC
AND
RELIGIOUS
FEELING
AS
PSALMS
OR
PROVERBS
DELETIONS
HOW
DO
YOU
THEN
VIEW
THE
WORDS
I
WARN
EVERYONE
WHO
HEARS
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
PROPHECY
OF
THIS
BOOK
IF
ANYONE
ADDS
ANYTHING
TO
THEM
GOD
WILL
ADD
TO
HIM
THE
PLAGUES
DESCRIBED
IN
THIS
BOOK
AND
IF
ANYONE
TAKES
AWAY
FROM
THIS
BOOK
THE
PROPHECY
GOD
WILL
TAKE
AWAY
FROM
HIM
HIS
SHARE
IN
THE
TREE
OF
LIFE
AND
IN
THE
HOLY
CITY
REV
SURELY
THIS
SETS
THE
STANDARD
AND
NOT
JUST
MANMADE
TRADITIONS
THESE
WORDS
CLEARLY
WERE
MEANT
TO
REFER
TO
THE
BOOK
OF
REVELATION
ALONE
NOT
TO
THE
WHOLE
BODY
OF
SCRIPTURE
REVELATION
ITSELF
WAS
ACCEPTED
VERY
LATE
INTO
THE
CANON
THE
CHURCH
SIMPLY
DID
NOT
SEE
IT
AS
HAVING
A
PRIMARY
ROLE
OF
ANY
KIND
IN
IDENTIFYING
AND
LIMITING
SCRIPTURE
IT
IS
ALSO
NOTEWORTHY
TO
CONSIDER
JESUS
ATTITUDE
HE
HAD
NO
ARGUMENT
WITH
THE
PHARISEES
OVER
ANY
OF
THE
OT
CANON
JOHN
AND
EXPLAINED
TO
HIS
FOLLOWERS
ON
THE
ROAD
TO
EMMAUS
THAT
IN
THE
LAW
PROPHETS
AND
PSALMS
WHICH
REFERRED
TO
HIM
THE
OT
DIVISION
OF
SCRIPTURE
LUKE
AS
WELL
AS
IN
LUKE
TAKING
GENESIS
TO
CHRONICLES
THE
JEWISH
ORDER
WE
WOULD
SAY
GENESIS
TO
MALACHI
AS
SCRIPTURE
JESUS
DOES
NOT
REFER
TO
THE
CANON
FOR
THE
SIMPLE
REASON
THAT
IN
HIS
DAY
THE
CANON
HAD
NOT
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
AS
A
CLOSED
COLLECTION
THE
BOOKS
OF
THE
APOCRYPHA
WERE
PART
OF
THE
SEPTUAGINT
WHICH
WAS
THE
BIBLE
OF
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
THE
HEBREW
CANON
WAS
NOT
CLOSED
UNTIL
CE
THE
TORAH
PENTATEUCH
LAW
WAS
ESTABLISHED
IN
JESUS
DAY
AS
WERE
THE
PROPHETS
WITH
THE
EXCLUSION
OF
DANIEL
THE
WRITINGS
HOWEVER
WERE
STILL
IN
FLUX
JESUS
DOES
NOT
REFER
TO
THE
WRITINGS
ONLY
TO
THE
PSALMS
WHICH
WERE
PART
OF
THEM
THE
BOOKS
OF
THE
APOCRYPHA
WERE
ALL
PART
OF
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
WAS
EVENTUALLY
SIFTED
AND
SEPARATED
TO
ARGUE
THAT
JESUS
IS
REFERRING
TO
THE
JEWISH
CANONICAL
ORDER
IN
LUKE
IS
WEAK
AT
BEST
HE
IS
NOT
QUOTING
SCRIPTURE
BUT
TELLING
A
CHRONOLOGICAL
STORY
AND
AS
MENTIONED
ABOVE
THE
HEBREW
CANON
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
PRESENT
ORDER
DID
NOT
EXIST
AS
SUCH
IN
JESUS
DAY
