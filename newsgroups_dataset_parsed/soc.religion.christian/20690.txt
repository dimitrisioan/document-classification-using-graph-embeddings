QUESTION
JESUS
ALONE
ONENESS
DEAR
FELLOW
NETTERS
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
A
TERM
LIKE
ONENESS
PENTECOSTALS
OR
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
HAS
OCCURRED
IN
POSTS
TO
THIS
GROUP
I
ALSO
KNOW
THAT
THERE
IS
A
MOVEMENT
CALLED
SOMETHING
LIKE
JESUS
ALONE
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
TRINITY
AND
HAVE
NO
PLANS
TO
CHANGE
THAT
BUT
REENTLY
I
WAS
MADE
AWARE
THAT
THERE
IS
AT
LEAST
ONE
PERSON
WITHIN
OUR
CHURCH
WHO
HOLDS
THE
VIEW
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
TRINITY
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
WE
WILL
DISCUSS
THIS
ITEM
AND
I
FEEL
THAT
I
SHALL
ASK
YOU
MY
FRIENDS
ON
THIS
GROUP
FOR
BACKGROUND
INFORMATION
CAN
ANYBODY
TELL
ME
THE
BASIC
REASONS
FOR
HOLDING
A
BELIEF
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
JESUS
AND
VICE
VERSA
THE
FOUNDATIONS
FOR
THE
TRINITY
I
SHALL
APPRECIATE
BOTH
QUOTES
FROM
THE
BIBLE
AND
HISTORICAL
DEVELOPMENT
THANK
YOU
ALL
IN
HIM
