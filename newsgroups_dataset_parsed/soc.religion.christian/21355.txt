JESUS
WASNT
REALLY
DESCENDED
FROM
DAVID
AS
THE
MESSIAH
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
JOSEPH
WAS
BUT
CHRISTIANS
SAY
THAT
JOSEPH
WASNT
RELATED
TO
JESUS
TRUTHFULLY
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
GENEOLOGY
OF
CHRIST
IN
LUKE
AND
THE
ONE
IN
MATTHEW
YOU
WILL
NOTICE
THAT
THEY
TRACE
DIFFERENT
LINES
BACK
TO
DAVID
I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
ONE
TRACES
MARYS
LINE
BACK
TO
DAVID
AND
THE
OTHER
TRACES
JOSEPHS
LINE
BACK
TO
DAVID
BOTH
OF
THEM
GO
BEYOND
DAVID
IN
HISTORY
ACORDING
TO
SOME
OF
MY
JEWISH
FRIENDS
JEWISHNESS
IS
PASSED
TO
A
CHILD
BY
THE
MOTHER
AND
THE
LEGAL
RIGHTS
OF
JEWISHNESS
ARE
PASSED
THROUGH
THE
FATHER
IF
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
ONE
OF
THESE
GENEOLOGIES
IS
MARYS
THEN
CHRISTS
BLOODLINE
IS
FROM
DAVID
THROUGH
HIS
MOTHER
THIS
ALSO
MEANS
THAT
CHRIST
HAD
ALL
OF
THE
LEGAL
RIGHTS
OF
A
DECENDANT
OF
DAVID
AS
ACCORDING
TO
AT
LEAST
ROMAN
LAW
AND
POSSIBLY
MOSAIC
LAW
AS
WELL
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
JOSEPH
WAS
CHRISTS
LEGAL
FATHER
THE
ARGUMENT
FOR
LUKES
GENEALOGY
BEING
THAT
OF
MARY
IS
VERY
WEAK
ACCORDING
TO
LUKE
AND
WHEN
HE
BEGAN
HIS
MINISTRY
JESUS
HIMSELF
WAS
ABOUT
THIRTY
YEARS
OF
AGE
BEING
SUPPOSEDLY
THE
SON
OF
JOSEPH
THE
SON
OF
ELI
ASIDE
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
MARY
IS
NOT
MENTIONED
THERE
ARE
TWO
POSSIBLE
INTERPRETATIONS
EITHER
JOSEPH
WAS
HER
FATHER
OR
HE
WAS
HER
BROTHER
CLEARLY
THIS
IS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
A
THIRD
WOULD
BE
THAT
JOSEPH
THE
SON
OF
ELI
WAS
HER
FATHER
AND
JUST
HAPPENED
TO
HAVE
THE
NAME
AS
THE
MAN
TO
WHOM
SHE
WAS
BETROTHED
BUT
THAT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
GRASPING
AT
STRAWS
THE
MOST
STRAIGHTFORWARD
INTERPRETATION
IS
THAT
LUKE
HAD
NO
INTENTION
OF
TRACING
MARYS
GENEALOGY
IN
WHICH
CASE
HE
WOULD
HAVE
NAMED
HER
BUT
THAT
HE
TRACES
HER
HUSBANDS
FROM
DAVIDS
SON
NATHAN
THE
MATTHEW
DESCENDANT
LIST
MOST
DEFINITELY
TRACES
DOWN
FROM
DAVIDS
SON
SOLOMON
TO
JOSEPH
MATTHEW
READS
AND
TO
JACOB
WAS
BORN
JOSEPH
THE
HUSBAND
OF
MARY
BY
WHOM
WAS
BORN
JESUS
WHO
IS
CALLED
CHRIST
THERE
ARE
TWO
APPARENT
PROBLEMS
THE
FIRST
IS
HOW
TO
RECONCILE
THE
TWO
PATERNAL
GENEALOGIES
WHICH
DIVERGE
WITH
THE
SONS
OF
DAVID
SOLOMON
AND
NATHAN
THE
SECOND
IS
WHY
IS
ANY
GENEALOGY
OF
JOSEPH
RELAVENT
AT
ALL
IF
JOSEPH
HAD
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
IF
JOSEPH
WAS
NOT
JESUSS
PHYSICAL
FATHER
THEN
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
IS
QUITE
CORRECT
THAT
CLAIMS
FOR
JESUSS
MESSIANIC
HERITAGE
ARE
NOT
BASED
ON
TRUTH
BUT
ONLY
ON
APPEARANCES
WHATEVER
JESUSS
DIVINE
NATURE
WAS
THE
SECOND
PROBLEM
IS
EASY
IN
MY
MIND
WE
ASSUME
THAT
JOSEPH
WAS
NOT
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CONCEPTION
OF
JESUS
IN
ANY
WAY
HOWEVER
A
HOLY
SPIRIT
CAPABLE
OF
WORKING
A
PHYSICAL
CONCEPTION
IN
MARY
IS
ALSO
CAPABLE
OF
EMPLOYING
THE
PHYSICAL
AGENCY
OF
JOSEPHS
SEED
IN
THIS
WORK
IN
OUR
MATERIALISTIC
TIMES
WE
INTERPRET
VIGINITY
AND
ITS
LOSS
SOLELY
IN
TERMS
OF
A
PHYSICAL
ACT
WHEREAS
IT
IS
REALLY
A
MATTER
OF
PURITY
ON
A
MUCH
HIGHER
LEVEL
AS
WELL
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
IS
THAT
NEITHER
MARY
NOR
JOSEPH
WAS
CONSCIOUS
OF
ANY
UNION
BETWEEN
THEM
THEY
HAD
NOT
KNOWNEACH
OTHER
THUS
THE
FIRST
GOSPELS
DEDICATION
OF
HALF
ITS
OPENING
CHAPTER
TO
THE
GENEALOGY
OF
JOSEPH
IS
QUITE
RELEVANT
TO
JESUS
THE
VIRGIN
BIRTH
NOT
WITHSTANDING
TO
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
THERE
IS
AN
ANSWER
THAT
CREATES
TO
BEGIN
WITH
MORE
PROBLEMS
THAN
IT
RESOLVES
IT
IS
THAT
THE
TWO
EVANGELISTS
ARE
RELATING
THE
BIRTHS
OF
TWO
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
CHILDREN
OF
TWO
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
SETS
OF
PARENTS
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
PARENTS
AND
THE
CHILD
AND
THE
BIRTHPLACE
IN
BETHLEHEM
THERE
IS
NO
POINT
IN
COMMON
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
STORIES
MATTHEW
AND
LUKE
CONVERGE
IN
THEIR
ACCOUNTS
ONLY
THIRTY
YEARS
LATER
WITH
THE
BAPTISM
OF
JESUS
IN
JORDAN
RUDOLF
STEINER
OFFERED
HIS
EXPLANATION
OF
HOW
THESE
ACCOUNTS
BEGIN
WITH
TWO
CHILDREN
AND
THEN
CONVERGE
WITH
THEIR
ACCOUNTS
OF
THE
ONE
JESUS
OF
NAZARETH
HE
DID
NOT
DERIVE
HIS
RESOLUTION
FROM
BIBLICAL
STUDY
OR
SPECULATION
OR
FROM
OTHER
EXTERNAL
DOCUMENTS
AND
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
HOW
THIS
COULD
BE
MIGHT
BRING
US
BEYOND
THE
LIMITS
OF
APPROPRIATENESS
FOR
THIS
NEWSGROUP
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
DETAILS
ARE
DESCRIBED
IN
STEINERS
THE
SPIRITUAL
GUIDANCE
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING
AND
OF
HUMANITY
THE
GOSPEL
OF
ST
LUKE
AND
THE
GOSPEL
OF
ST
MATTHEW
WHETHER
OR
NOT
RUDOLF
STEINERS
METHODS
AND
EXPLANATION
ARE
ACCEPTED
AS
VALID
AT
LEAST
THIS
INTERPRETATION
RESOLVES
THE
APPARENT
CONTRADICTIONS
OF
THE
TWO
GENEALOGIES
WHILE
LEAVING
THE
TEXT
INTACT
AS
FOR
THE
PASSING
OF
ONES
JEWISHNESS
THROUGH
THE
MOTHER
THIS
WAS
NEVER
AN
ISSUE
WITH
JESUS
NO
ONE
EVER
QUESTIONED
HIS
OR
MARYS
JEWISHNESS
THE
ISSUE
OF
THE
GENEALOGIES
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
HIS
PATERNAL
LINE
OF
DESCENT
