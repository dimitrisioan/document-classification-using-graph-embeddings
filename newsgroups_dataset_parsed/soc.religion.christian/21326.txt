RE
WHAT
WAS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
IN
ARTICLE

WRITES
YOUR
ROOMMATE
IS
CORRECT
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
REFERS
TO
THE
CONCEPTION
OF
MARY
IN
HER
MOTHERS
WOMB
OKAY
NOW
THAT
WEVE
DEFINED
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
DOCTRINE
WOULD
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
FOR
THOSE
MORE
KNOWLEDGEABLE
IN
THE
AREA
TO
GIVE
THE
BIBLICALLY
OR
OTHER
SUPPORT
FOR
IT
IVE
ATTEMPTED
TO
COME
TO
TERMS
WITH
IT
PREVIOUSLY
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
UNDERSTAND
IT
FOR
LEARNING
PURPOSES
AND
HAVENT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
GRASP
THE
REASONING
IT
WAS
A
GIFT
FROM
GOD
I
THINK
BASICALLY
THE
REASONING
WAS
THAT
THE
TRADITION
IN
THE
CHURCH
HELD
THAT
MARY
WAS
ALSO
WITHOUT
SIN
AS
WAS
JESUS
AS
THE
TENETS
OF
FAITH
DEVELOPED
PARTICULARLY
WITH
AUGUSTINE
SIN
WAS
MORE
AND
MORE
EQUATED
WITH
SEX
AND
THUS
MARY
WAS
ASSUMED
TO
BE
A
VIRGIN
FOR
LIFE
SINCE
SHE
NEVER
SINNED
AND
SINCE
SHE
WAS
THE
SPOUSE
OF
GOD
ETC
SINCE
WE
ALSO
HAD
THIS
NOTION
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
IE
THAT
MAN
IS
BORN
WITH
A
PREDISPOSITION
TO
SIN
AND
SINCE
MARY
DID
NOT
HAVE
THIS
PREDISPOSITION
BECAUSE
SHE
DID
NOT
EVER
SIN
SHE
DIDNT
HAVE
ORIGINAL
SIN
WHEN
SCIENCE
DISCOVERED
THE
PROCESS
OF
CONCEPTION
THE
NEXT
STEP
WAS
TO
ASSUME
THAT
MARY
WAS
CONCEIVED
WITHOUT
ORIGINAL
SIN
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
MARY
AT
THAT
TIME
APPEARED
TO
A
GIRL
NAMED
BERNADETTE
AT
LOURDES
SHE
REFERED
TO
HERSELF
AS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
SINCE
A
NINE
YEAR
OLD
WOULD
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
ABOUT
THE
DOCTRINE
THE
APPARITION
WAS
DEEMED
TO
BE
TRUE
AND
IT
SEALED
THE
CASE
FOR
THE
DOCTRINE
RCS
HOLD
THAT
ALL
REVELATION
COMES
FROM
TWO
EQUALLY
IMPORTANT
SOURCES
THAT
BEING
SACRED
SCRIPTURE
AND
HOLY
TRADITION
IN
THIS
CASE
MOSTLY
TRADITION
