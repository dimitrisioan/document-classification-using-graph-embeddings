JEFF
FENHOLT
PART
OF
BLACK

HES
A
MAJOR

IN

HIS
LIFE
AROUND
AND
HE
AND
HIS
WIFE
GO
ON
TOURS
SINGING
WITNESSING
AND
SPREADING
THE
GOSPEL
FOR

I
MAY
BE
WRONG
ABOUT
BLACK
SABBATH
BUT
I
KNOW
HE
WAS
IN
A
SIMILAR
BAND
IF
IT
WASNT
THAT
PARTICULAR
GROUP
JEFF
FENHOLT
CLAIMS
TO
HAVE
ONCE
BEEN
A
ROADIE
FOR
BLACK

POSTER
I
SAW
AT
THE
CHRISTIAN
BOOKSTORE
I
FREQUENT
REALLY
TURNED
ME
OFF
IT
WAS
ADDRESSED
TO
ALL
HOMOSEXUALS
PROSTITUTES
DRUG
ADDICTS
ALCOHOLICS
AND
HEADBANGERS
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WELL
IF
I
SHOWED
UP
WITH
MY
LONG
HAIR
AND
BLACK
LEATHER
JACKET
I
WOULD
HAVE
FELT
A
LITTLE
PREJUDGED
AS
A
ORTHODOX
CHRISTIAN
AND
A
HEADBANGER
I
WAS
SLIGHTLY
INSULTED
AT
BEING
LUMPED
TOGETHER
WITH
DRUG
ADDICTS
AND
ALCOHOLICS
OH
YES
I
SUPPOSE
SINCE
I
DRINK
A
GOOD
GERMAN
BEER
NOW
AND
THEN
THAT
MAKES
ME
AN
ALCOHOLIC
NOT
STEVEN
C
SALARIS
WEREA
LOT
MORE
DANGEROUS
THAN
LIVE
CREW
AND
THEIR
STUPID
USE
OF
FOUL
LANGUAGE
BECAUSE
WE
HAVE
IDEAS
WE
HAVE
A
PHILOSOPHY
