it
seems
that
during
the
middle
ages
it
was
customary
for
pastors
to
explain
the
trinity
to
their
parishoners
by
analogy
to
water
water
is
water
but
can
exist
in
three
formsliquid
ice
and
vapor
thus
it
is
possible
for
one
essence
to
exist
in
three
forms
this
sounds
to
me
like
a
sort
of
generic
modalism
in
the
the
three
phases
of
water
are
but
different
modes
of
behavior
of
the
same
physical
stuff
it
certainly
does
not
seem
to
me
to
describe
the
orthodox
position
of
course
i
suppose
that
the
medieval
view
of
water
may
have
been
different
but
now
we
know
that
the
phases
of
water
are
just
different
behaviors
of
the
same
physical
stuff
different
modes
not
different
identities
but
perhaps
the
medieval
people
did
not
know
that
and
recently
the
pastor
of
my
church
drew
an
analogy
which
i
also
found
usefula
woman
is
often
percieved
by
others
in
three
ways
depending
on
their
relationship
to
hera
mother
a
wife
and
an
employee
in
a
business
this
is
clearly
modalistic
monarchianism
since
these
three
aspects
depend
solely
on
point
of
view
and
are
do
not
really
represent
actual
variety
within
the
person
do
you
now
begin
to
see
why
