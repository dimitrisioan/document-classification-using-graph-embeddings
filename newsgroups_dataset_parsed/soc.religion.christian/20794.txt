RE
WHEN
ARE
TWO
PEOPLE
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
FOR
YOU
ALL
RELATED
TO
THIS
JESUS
CONDEMNS
DIVORCE
SEVERAL
TIMES
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
AND
I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
WITH
THIS
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
DOES
GRANT
ANNULMENTS
WITH
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
THE
MARRIAGE
NEVER
REALLY
EXISTED
IN
GODS
EYES
PLEASE
IF
I
AM
MISTINTERPRETING
CORRECT
ME
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
WITNESSED
MARRIAGES
WHERE
TWO
PEOPLE
WERE
VERY
MUCH
IN
LOVE
BUT
RECOGNIZED
THAT
THEY
WERE
DESTROYING
THEMSELVES
AND
EACH
OTHER
BY
STAYING
IN
A
MARRIAGE
AND
THAT
THE
PROBLEMS
WERE
DUE
TO
PERSONAL
CHILDHOOD
ISSUES
THAT
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
RESOLVED
I
ASK
YOU
IS
DIVORCE
JUSTIFIED
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
THEY
KNEW
WHO
THEY
WERE
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
THEY
WERE
DEEPLY
IN
LOVE
BUT
IN
THE
END
IT
DID
NOT
WORK
OUT
I
MUST
ADMIT
THAT
I
DONT
SEE
JESUS
FORCING
THEM
TO
LIVE
TOGETHER
OR
EVEN
CONDEMNING
THAT
THEY
GO
AND
SEEK
HAPPINESS
WITH
SOMEONE
ELSE
LATER
ON
OPINIONS
VERA
I
AM
YOUR
CLOCK
I
BIND
UNTO
MYSELF
TODAY
VERA
NOYES
I
AM
YOUR
RELIGION
THE
STRONG
NAME
OF
THE
NOYEMIDWAYUCHICAGOEDU
I
OWN
YOU
TRINITY
NO
DISCLAIMER
WHAT
LARD
ST
PATRICKS
BREASTPLATE
IS
THERE
TO
DISCLAIM
THIS
IS
A
COMMONLY
DISCUSSED
QUESTION
THOUGH
ITS
BEEN
LONG
ENOUGH
THAT
ILL
ALLOW
IT
TO
BE
ASKED
AS
YOU
MIGHT
EXPECT
THERE
IS
A
RANGE
OF
ANSWERS
CATHOLICS
AND
SOME
OTHERS
WILL
SAY
THAT
DIVORCE
IS
NEVER
JUSTIFIED
BY
THE
WAY
IN
SITUATIONS
WHERE
SOMEONE
IS
BEING
ABUSED
OR
FOR
OTHER
SERIOUS
CAUSE
SEPARATION
IS
ALLOWED
BY
ALL
TRADITIONS
THAT
I
KNOW
NO
ONE
SHOULD
BE
FORCED
TO
STAY
IN
A
SITUATION
WHERE
THEY
ARE
IN
DANGER
OTHERS
SEE
IT
AS
A
LAST
RESORT
IN
SITUATIONS
THAT
HAVE
FALLEN
APART
BADLY
ENOUGH
THAT
THE
BEST
WE
CAN
HOPE
FOR
IS
TO
CHOOSE
THE
LESSER
OF
EVILS
IN
SOME
SENSE
THE
DIFFICULT
LEGAL
QUESTION
TURNS
OUT
NOT
TO
BE
DIVORCE
BUT
REMARRIAGE
THATS
BECAUSE
OF
JESUS
STATEMENT
IN
MARK
AND
PAR
AS
WITH
SO
MANY
OTHER
THINGS
THIS
TURNS
ON
YOUR
APPROACH
TO
THE
BIBLE
CONSERVATIVE
PROTESTANTS
TEND
TO
SEE
STATEMENTS
LIKE
THIS
AS
HAVING
NO
EXCEPTIONS
MORE
LIBERAL
ONES
ARE
WILLING
TO
MAKE
ALLOWANCES
FOR
SITUATIONS
WHERE
A
LITERAL
INTERPRETATION
WOULD
LEAD
TO
PAINFUL
RESULTS
IT
IS
NOTED
THAT
AT
THE
TIME
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
MAN
TO
DIVORCE
HIS
WIFE
ALMOST
ON
A
WHIM
THUS
A
COMMON
EXPLANATION
IN
THE
MORE
LIBERAL
APPROACH
IS
THAT
JESUS
WAS
TRYING
TO
PROTECT
PEOPLE
FROM
THIS
SORT
OF
THING
NOT
TO
ESTABLISH
AN
ABSOLUTE
RULE
TO
WHICH
THERE
COULD
NEVER
BE
EXCEPTIONS
CATHOLICS
AS
IS
TYPICAL
WITH
CATHOLIC
ETHICS
TAKE
A
THEORETICAL
HARD
LINE
BUT
ALLOW
FOR
EXCEPTIONS
IN
PRACTICE
THROUGH
THE
PROCESS
OF
ANULLMENT
IN
THE
LAST
DISCUSSION
MOST
OF
OUR
NONCATHOLIC
READERS
SEEMED
TO
ACCEPT
WITH
SOME
RELUCTANCE
THAT
IN
SOME
CASES
THERE
MIGHT
BE
NO
GOOD
ALTERNATIVE
BUT
THERE
WAS
A
FEELING
THAT
THE
CHURCH
SHOULD
OFTEN
BE
DOING
A
BETTER
JOB
OF
HELPING
PEOPLE
PREPARE
FOR
MARRIAGE
AND
DEAL
WITH
PROBLEMS
THAT
COME
UP
DURING
IT
AND
THAT
IN
A
PROPERLY
RUN
CHURCH
DIVORCE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
NECESSARY
