THE
DISCUSSION
BEGINS
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
ONE
OF
THE
LAWS
OF
NATURE
SPECIFYING
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
SEEMS
TO
DICTATE
AT
LEAST
TO
THIS
LAYMANS
MIND
THERE
MUST
BE
A
CAUSAL
EVENT
NO
REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVE
EXISTS
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
CAUSALITY
IS
ACTUALLY
A
PROPERTY
OF
SPACETIME
CAUSES
PRECEDE
THEIR
EFFECTS
AND
I
MUST
CONCEDE
HERE
CAUSE
BEFORE
EFFECT
IMPLIES
TIME
TIME
IS
PART
OF
SPACETIME
HENSE
THE
ARGUMENT
WOULD
BE
VALID
I
COULD
RETURN
AND
SAY
THAT
THIS
DOES
NOT
INFER
THE
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
RELATIONSHIP
BEING
UNIQUE
TO
THIS
SPACETIME
BUT
I
WONT
BECAUSE
THE
POINT
IS
MOOT
DOESNT
ADDRESS
WHY
WHICH
PETRI
PIKHO
ADDRESSES
BELOW
I
ALSO
CONCEDE
THAT
I
WAS
DOUBLY
REMISS
AS
I
ASSERTED
NO
REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVE
EXISTS
AN
ENTIRELY
SUBJECTIVE
STATEMENT
ON
MY
PART
AND
ONE
THAT
COULD
BE
INVALIDATED
GIVEN
TIME
AND
FURTHER
DISCOVERY
BY
THE
SCIENTIST
I
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
A
PROVING
A
THEORY
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
SPECIFY
THAT
THIS
IS
HOW
IT
HAPPENED
BUT
PROPOSES
A
LIKELY
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
PHENOMENA
IN
QUESTION
AM
I
MISTAKEN
WITH
THIS
UNDERSTANDING
BUT
IF
YOU
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
MUST
BE
AN
ANSWER
TO
HOW
DID
THE
UNIVERSE
OUR
SPACETIME
EMERGE
FROM
NOTHING
SCIENCE
HAS
SOME
GOOD
CANDIDATES
FOR
AN
ANSWER
ALL
OF
WHICH
REQUIRE
SOMETHING
WE
CHRISTIANS
READILY
ADMIT
TO
FAITH
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
CANDIDATES
BELIES
THAT
NONE
ARE
CONCLUSIVE
WITH
OUT
CONCLUSIVE
EVIDENCE
WE
ARE
LEFT
WITH
FAITH
IT
COULD
EVEN
BE
ARGUED
THAT
ONE
OF
THESE
HYPOTHESES
MAY
ONE
DAY
BE
PROVEN
AS
BEST
AS
A
NONREPEATABLE
EVENT
CAN
BE
PROVEN
BUT
I
ASK
WHAT
HOLDS
SOMEONE
TODAY
TO
THE
BELIEF
THAT
ANY
OR
ALL
OF
THEM
ARE
CORRECT
EXCEPT
BY
FAITH
A
COUPLE
OF
PARAGRAPHS
DELETED
SUMMARY
WE
ASK
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
I
THINK
THIS
QUESTION
SHOULD
ACTUALLY
BE
SPLIT
INTO
TWO
PARTS
NAMELY
WHY
IS
THERE
EXISTENCE
WHY
ANYTHING
EXISTS
AND
HOW
DID
THE
UNIVERSE
EMERGE
FROM
NOTHING
IT
IS
CLEAR
SCIENCE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THE
FIRST
QUESTION
HOWEVER
IS
IT
A
MEANINGFUL
QUESTION
AFTER
ALL
I
WOULD
SAY
IT
ISNT
CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
APPARENTLY
IT
IS
FOR
MANY
PERSONS
HENCE
WE
HAVE
RELIGIONS
THE
QUESTION
WHY
ANYTHING
EXISTS
CAN
BE
COUNTERED
BY
DEMANDING
ANSWER
TO
A
QUESTION
WHY
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
NOTHINGNESS
OR
IN
NONEXISTENCE
ACTUALLY
BOTH
QUESTIONS
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
DEVOID
OF
MEANING
THINGS
THAT
EXIST
DO
AND
THINGS
THAT
DONT
EXIST
DONT
EXIST
TAUTOLOGY
AT
ITS
BEST
CAREFULLY
EXAMINE
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
AND
THEN
THE
COUNTERQUESTION
THE
FIRST
ASKS
WHY
WHILE
THE
SECOND
IS
A
REQUEST
FOR
DEFINITION
IT
DOESNT
ADDRESS
WHY
SOMETHING
DOES
OR
DOES
NOT
EXIST
BUT
ASKS
TO
DEFINE
THE
LACK
OF
EXISTENCE
THE
SECOND
QUESTION
IS
UNANSWERABLE
INDEED
FOR
HOW
DO
WE
IDENTIFY
SOMETHING
AS
NOTHING
ARENT
THEY
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
TERMS
HOW
DO
WE
IDENTIFY
A
STATE
OF
NONEXISTENCE
AGAIN
THIS
IS
NEARING
THE
LIMITS
OF
THIS
SIMPLE
LAYMANS
ABILITY
TO
COMPREHEND
AND
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
AN
EXPLANATION
I
MIGHT
ADD
THE
WORLDVIEW
OF
THINGS
THAT
EXIST
DO
AND
THINGS
THAT
DONTDONT
IS
AS
GROUNDED
IN
THE
REALM
OF
THE
NONFALSIFIABLE
AS
DOES
THE
THEISTS
BELIEF
IN
GOD
IT
IS
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THERE
IS
NOT
A
REASON
FOR
BEING
SOMETHING
AS
ULTIMATELY
UNSUPPORTABLE
AS
THE
POSITION
OF
THERE
BEING
A
REASON
ITS
VERY
FOUNDATION
EXISTS
IN
THE
SAME
SOIL
AS
THAT
OF
ONE
WHO
CLAIMS
THERE
IS
A
REASON
WE
COME
TO
THIS
EITHER
I
AM
THEREFORE
I
AM
OR
I
AM
FOR
A
REASON
IF
THE
FORMER
IS
A
SATISFACTORY
ANSWER
THEN
YOU
ARE
DONE
FOR
YOU
ARE
SATISFIED
AND
NEED
NOT
A
DOCTOR
IF
THE
LATTER
YOUR
SEARCH
IS
JUST
BEGINNING
I
SERIOUSLY
DOUBT
GOD
COULD
HAVE
AN
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
TIME
WILL
TELL
SOME
CHRISTIANS
I
HAVE
TALKED
TO
HAVE
SAID
THAT
ACTUALLY
GOD
IS
HIMSELF
THE
EXISTENCE
HOWEVER
I
SEE
SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
THIS
ANSWER
FIRST
IT
INEVITABLY
LEADS
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
GOD
IS
ACTUALLY
ALL
EXISTENCE
GOOD
AND
EVIL
DEVILS
AND
ANGELS
US
AND
THEM
THIS
IS
PANTHEISM
NOT
CHRISTIANITY
AGREED
IT
WOULD
LEAD
ME
TO
QUESTION
THEIR
DEFINITION
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AS
WELL
ANOTHER
ANSWER
IS
THAT
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
SOUNDS
MUCH
BETTER
BUT
I
AM
TEMPTED
TO
ASK
DOES
GOD
HIMSELF
EXIST
THEN
IF
GOD
IS
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
OWN
EXISTENCE
IT
CAN
ONLY
MEAN
THAT
HE
HAS
IN
TERMS
OF
HUMAN
TIME
ALWAYS
EXISTED
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
SOURCE
OF
ALL
EXISTENCE
THIS
DOES
NOT
PRECLUDE
HIS
EXISTENCE
IT
ONLY
SEEKS
TO
IDENTIFY
HIS
QUALITIES
IMPLYING
HE
EXISTS
TO
HAVE
QUALITIES
BTW
THE
BEST
ANSWER
I
HAVE
HEARD
IS
THAT
HUMAN
REASONING
IS
INCAPABLE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
SUCH
QUESTIONS
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
MYSELF
I
DO
NOT
ACCEPT
SUCH
ANSWERS
SINCE
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
OTHER
METHODS
LIKE
THE
THEIST
WE
COME
TO
A
STATEMENT
OF
FAITH
FOR
THIS
POSITION
ASSUMES
THAT
THE
EVIDENCE
AT
HAND
IS
CONCLUSIVE
NOTE
I
AM
NOT
ARGUING
AGAINST
SCIENTIFIC
ENDEAVOR
FOR
SCIENCE
IS
USEFUL
FOR
UNDERSTANDING
THE
UNIVERSE
IN
WHICH
WE
EXIST
BUT
I
DIFFER
FROM
THE
ATHEIST
IN
A
MATTER
OF
PERSPECTIVE
I
SEEK
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
EXISTS
TO
UNDERSTAND
AND
APPRECIATE
THE
ART
OF
THE
CREATOR
I
ALSO
HAVE
DISCOVERED
SCIENCE
IS
AN
INADEQUATE
TOOL
TO
ANSWER
WHY
IT
APPEARS
THAT
M
PIHKO
AGREES
AS
WE
SHALL
SEE
BUT
BECAUSE
A
TOOL
IS
INADEQUATE
TO
ANSWER
A
QUESTION
DOES
NOT
PRECLUDE
THE
QUESTION
ASSERTING
THAT
WHY
IS
AN
INVALID
QUESTION
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
AN
ANSWER
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
THE
VERY
LAWS
OF
NATURE
DEMAND
A
WHY
THAT
ISNT
TRUE
OF
SOMETHING
OUTSIDE
OF
NATURE
IE
SUPERNATURAL
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
SCIENCE
IS
A
COLLECTION
OF
MODELS
TELLING
US
HOW
NOT
WHY
SOMETHING
HAPPENS
I
CANNOT
SEE
ANY
GOOD
REASON
WHY
THE
WHY
QUESTIONS
WOULD
BE
BOUND
ONLY
TO
NATURAL
THINGS
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
SUPERNATURAL
DOMAIN
EXISTS
IF
SUPERNATURAL
BEINGS
EXIST
IT
IS
AS
APPROPRIATE
TO
ASK
WHY
THEY
DO
SO
AS
IT
IS
TO
ASK
WHY
WE
EXIST
MY
APOLOGIES
I
WAS
USING
WHY
AS
WHY
DID
THIS
COME
TO
BE
WHY
DID
PREEXISTENCE
BECOME
EXISTENCE
WHY
DID
PRESPACETIME
BECOME
SPACETIME
BUT
WE
COME
TO
THE
ADMISSION
THAT
SCIENCE
FAILS
TO
ANSWER
WHY
BECAUSE
IT
CANT
BE
ANSWERED
IN
THE
REALM
OF
MODERN
SCIENCE
DOES
THAT
MAKE
THE
QUESTION
INVALID
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ANY
TECHNOLOGY
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PRODUCE
THAT
NECESSARY
SPARK
OF
LIFE
DESPITE
HAVING
ALL
OF
THE
PARTS
AVAILABLE
JUST
MY
OPINION
THIS
OPINION
IS
ALSO
CALLED
VITALISM
NAMELY
THAT
LIVING
SYSTEMS
ARE
SOMEHOW
FUNDAMENTALLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
INANIMATE
SYSTEMS
DO
CHRISTIANS
IN
GENERAL
ADOPT
THIS
POSITION
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
WHEN
SCIENTISTS
ANNOUNCE
THEY
HAVE
CREATED
PRIMITIVE
LIFE
SAY
SMALL
BACTERIA
IN
A
LAB
I
SUPPOSE
WE
WOULD
DO
THE
SAME
THING
AS
WHEN
GALILEO
OR
CAPERNICUS
WAS
VINDICATED
BEFORE
SOMEONE
STARTS
JUMPING
UP
AND
DOWN
SCREAMING
INQUISITION
NOTE
I
SAID
VINDICATED
I
CERTAINLY
HOPE
WEVE
GOTTEN
BEYOND
THE
SHOOTING
THE
MESSENGER
STAGE
M
PIHKO
DOES
PRESENT
A
GOOD
POINT
THOUGH
WE
MAY
NEED
TO
ASK
WHAT
DO
I
AS
AN
INDIVIDUAL
CHRISTIAN
BASE
MY
FAITH
ON
WILL
IT
BE
SHAKEN
BY
THE
PRODUCTION
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
SHATTERS
OUR
SACRED
COWS
OR
WILL
WE
SEEK
TO
UNDERSTAND
IF
A
NEW
DISCOVERY
TRULY
DISAGREES
WITH
WHAT
GOD
SAID
AND
CONTINUES
TO
SAY
IN
HIS
WORD
WHY
DO
I
ASK
WHY
