AROUND
NEWSGROUPS
CHRISTIANS
ARE
FREE
TO
READ

POST
ENTRIES
ON
THE
ATHEIST
NEWSGROUPS

MUSLIMS
ARE
FREE
TO
SO
SO
IN
OTHER

AS

ITS
UP
TO
EACH
INDIVIDUAL
TO
DEFINE
THEIR

CONCERNING

THAT
I
AM
RIGHT
AND
YOU
ARE
WRONG
THIS
IS
TRUE
OF
BOTH
THEISTS
AND
ATHEISTS
HOPEFULLY
A
MORE
CONSTRUCTIVE
DIALOGUE
BETWEEN
