RE
QUESTIONING
AUTHORITY
DESPITE
MY
TRENDY
LIBERAL
FEMINIST
TENDENCIES
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
I
BASICALLY
AGREE
WITH
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
I
WILL
REBUT
DR
NANCYS
SWEETIE
WRITES
CHRIS
MUSSACK
WRITES
FOR
ALL
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO
INSIST
I
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
WHY
AUTHORITIES
SOMETIMES
TELL
PEOPLE
TO
DO
EVIL
THINGS
PEOPLE
WHO
JUST
FOLLOW
ORDERS
HAVE
TORTURED
AND
KILLED
OTHERS
IN
VERY
LARGE
NUMBERS
AND
PROTEST
THEIR
INNOCENCE
AFTERWARDS
THE
BASIC
QUESTION
HERE
IS
HOW
DO
I
KNOW
WHAT
I
AM
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
THIS
IS
TRUE
IN
EVERY
SITUATION
THAT
COMES
UP
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
THINK
ABOUT
IT
AT
ALL
AND
MERELY
FOLLOW
THEIR
IMPULSES
I
CLAIM
THAT
IS
JUST
AS
DANGEROUS
AS
FOLLOWING
AUTHORITY
I
COULD
SITE
SEXUALLY
TRANSMITTED
DISEASES
DRUG
ABUSE
ALL
MANNER
OF
CRIMINAL
ACTIVITY
THE
SAVINGS
AND
LOAN
SCANDAL
CAR
ACCIDENTS
EGGS
THROWN
AT
MY
HOUSE
ALL
ARE
EXAMPLES
OF
PEOPLE
NOT
FOLLOWING
AUTHORITY
I
COULD
EASILY
ARGUE
THAT
IN
THE
EVIL
EXAMPLES
YOU
GAVE
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
A
LEADER
NOT
FOLLOWING
HIS
AUTHORITY
AND
DOING
WHAT
HE
WANTED
OF
COURSE
WHERE
IS
THE
TOP
OF
THE
CHAIN
THEREIN
LIES
OUR
SEARCH
WHEN
YOUR
AUTHORITY
STARTS
TELLING
YOU
TO
DO
THINGS
YOU
SHOULD
ASK
QUESTIONS
EXCEPT
FOR
SITUATIONS
OF
PRESSING
NEED
I
SAID
SHUT
THE
HATCH
BECAUSE
THE
SUBMARINE
IS
FILLING
WITH
WATER
ANY
REASONABLE
AUTHORITY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
GIVE
AT
LEAST
SOME
JUSTIFICATION
THAT
YOU
CAN
UNDERSTAND
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
AS
SIMPLE
AS
YOU
ARE
CLAIMING
PRESSING
NEED
IS
AMBIGUOUS
SHOULD
I
RECYCLE
OR
NOT
REALIZE
THAT
I
HAVE
FOUR
KIDS
WHO
DESPITE
BEING
VERY
PRECOCIOUS
OF
COURSE
ARE
VERY
TIRING
WITH
THEIR
CONSTANT
LACK
OF
UNDERSTANDING
THE
TREMENDOUS
KNOWLEDGE
I
WISH
TO
IMPART
TO
THEM
JUST
BE
SURE
TO
LISTEN
WHEN
AUTHORITY
ANSWERS
AHH
AN
IRONIC
ENDING
THE
IRONY
I
WAS
IMPLYING
IN
MY
INITIAL
PITHY
RETORT
TO
THE
BUMPER
STICKER
CLICHE
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
WAS
THAT
I
WAS
QUESTIONING
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
PERSON
TELLING
ME
TO
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
IT
SEEMS
THERE
IS
A
CERTAIN
SEGMENT
OF
SOCIETY
THAT
FINDS
MEANING
ONLY
IN
BEING
DIFFERENT
ONLY
IN
REBELLING
FORSAKING
EVERYTHING
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
FREEDOM
I
QUESTION
THEIR
INTEGRITY
AND
FORTITUDE
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
FREEDOM
THAT
COMES
FROM
DOING
A
TASK
CORRECTLY
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
ARE
AT
DIFFERENT
LEVELS
OF
DEVELOPMENT
IN
DIFFERENT
AREAS
PART
OF
THE
CHALLENGE
OF
LIFE
IS
TO
FIND
THE
RIGHT
AUTHORITIES
TO
FOLLOW
WE
CANT
KNOW
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
OFTEN
WHEN
LEARNING
A
NEW
SKILL
OR
SUBJECT
I
WILL
FOLLOW
THE
TEACHER
PERHAPS
BLINDLY
ONLY
WHEN
I
HAVE
LEARNED
ENOUGH
TO
ASK
APPROPRIATE
QUESTIONS
SHOULD
I
QUESTION
HIM
ONLY
WHEN
I
HAVE
DEVELOPED
MY
SKILLS
ENOUGH
SHOULD
I
CHALLENGE
HIM
ONCE
AGAIN
HOW
DO
I
KNOW
WHEN
I
GET
TO
THOSE
STAGES
IF
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
TOLD
TO
QUESTION
AUTHORITY
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULDNT
CHRIS
MUSSACK
A
GOOD
COMEDIAN
SHOULD
NEVER
HAVE
TO
EXPLAIN
HIS
JOKES
