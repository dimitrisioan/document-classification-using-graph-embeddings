RE
WHEN
ARE
TWO
PEOPLE
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
IN
A
PREVIOUS
ARTICLE
ROBERT
ANDERSON
SAYS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
YOUR
OPINIONS
ON
THIS
WHEN
EXACTLY
DOES
AN
ENGAGED
COUPLE
BECOME
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
SOME
SAY
THAT
IF
THE
TWO
HAVE
PUBLICALLY
ANNOUNCED
THEIR
PLANS
TO
MARRY
HAVE
MADE
THEIR
VOWS
TO
GOD
AND
ARE
UNSWERVINGLY
COMMITTED
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
I
REALIZE
THIS
IS
A
SUBJECTIVE
QUALIFIER
THEY
ARE
MARRIEDJOINED
IN
GODS
SIGHT
I
HAVE
DISCUSSED
THIS
WITH
MY
GIRLFRIEND
OFTEN
I
CONSIDER
MYSELF
MARRIED
THOUGH
LEGALLY
I
AM
NOT
NEITHER
OF
US
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
OTHER
PEOPLE
SEXUALLY
ALTHOUGH
WE
HAVE
BEEN
WITH
EACH
OTHER
WE
DID
NOT
HAVE
SEXUAL
RELATIONS
UNTIL
WE
DECIDED
TO
MARRY
EVENTUALLY
FOR
FINANCIAL
AND
DISTANCE
REASONS
WE
WILL
NOT
BE
LEGALLY
MARRIED
FOR
ANOTHER
YEAR
AND
A
HALF
UNTIL
THEN
I
CONSIDER
MYSELF
MARRIED
FOR
LIFE
IN
GODS
EYES
I
HAVE
FAITH
THAT
WE
HAVE
A
STRONG
RELATIONSHIP
AND
HAVE
HAD
FOR
OVER
YEARS
AND
WILL
BE
FULL
OF
JOY
WHEN
WE
MARRY
IN
A
CHURCH
FIRST
HOWEVER
WE
MUST
FIND
A
CHURCH
WE
WILL
BE
LIVING
IN
A
NEW
AREA
WHEN
WE
MARRY
AND
WILL
NEED
TO
FIND
A
NEW
CHURCH
COMMUNITY
ANYWAY
I
FEEL
THAT
IF
TWO
PEOPLE
COMMIT
TO
MARRIAGE
BEFORE
GOD
THEY
ARE
MARRIED
AND
ARE
BOUND
BY
THAT
COMMITMENT
