re
major
views
of
the
trinity
in
article
you
write
yes
my
comments
were
long
enough
that
i
dont
want
to
repeat
them
here
but
ill
send
them
via
email
back
to
the
author
certainly
it
was
not
intended
to
be
a
description
of
three
similar
deities
though
i
certainly
see
why
it
would
look
that
way
thanks
for
the
letter
your
comments
helped
some
as
to
the
last
comment
i
certainly
realize
that
it
was
not
intended
to
sound
that
way
i
am
still
trying
to
understand
how
a
spiritual
being
colud
truly
be
one
and
three
at
the
same
time
all
of
the
descriptions
of
this
are
either
platonic
or
sound
like
special
pleading
sort
of
they
appear
to
be
three
seperate
beings
in
all
ways
but
really
they
are
one
trust
me
neither
of
these
is
acceptible
to
me
the
fact
is
so
far
the
only
descriptions
of
the
trinity
that
makes
any
sense
to
me
are
the
modalistic
ones
such
as
modalistic
monarchianism
or
economic
trinitarianism
i
can
accept
that
the
three
aspects
are
intrinsic
to
the
nature
of
god
so
i
perhaps
lean
more
towards
the
latter
i
am
trying
here
to
see
if
anybody
can
come
up
with
another
description
that
is
both
orthodox
and
believable
sarimateradatacom
formerly
tdatirvsarima
or
stanleyfriesenelsegundocancrcom
i
fear
orthodox
theologians
have
been
overly
in
love
with
paradox
to
the
extent
that
wellmeaning
people
think
theyve
just
flatout
confused
theres
no
problem
with
things
being
both
and
eg
if
the
are
different
parts
of
the
father
son
and
holy
spirit
arent
exactly
parts
of
god
because
parts
are
things
distinguished
by
physical
separation
all
three
persons
are
omnipresent
so
they
are
obviously
arent
physically
separate
but
theyre
in
some
way
different
aspects
modes
or
whatever
of
one
god
if
you
accept
economic
trinitarianism
its
possible
that
you
dont
have
any
substantive
difference
with
the
standard
view
is
it
possible
that
you
just
dont
find
the
neoplatonic
explanation
illuminating
