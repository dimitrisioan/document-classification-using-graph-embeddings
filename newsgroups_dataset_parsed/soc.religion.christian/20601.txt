RE
QUESTIONS
FROM
A
NEWBIE
THE
CONCEPT
OF
GOD
AS
A
TEACHER
IS
INDEED
INTERESTING
DOES
HE
GRADE
ON
A
CURVE
DOES
HE
CHEAT
THAT
IS
INTERESTING
NOT
TO
MENTION
THOUGHT
PROVOKING
MY
OWN
CONCEPT
IS
THAT
HE
IS
A
FATHER
AND
WE
ARE
HIS
CHILDREN
IN
THAT
HE
LOVES
US
WITH
A
LOVE
THAT
WE
CAN
NEVER
UNDERSTAND
UNTIL
WE
ARE
WITH
HIM
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THAT
HE
LOOKS
ON
THE
HEART
AS
THE
FINAL
MEASURE
FROM
THAT
PERSPECTIVE
IN
A
GRADING
CONTEXT
THE
HEART
IS
THE
FINAL
TEST
SPECIFICALLY
MOST
CHRISTIANS
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
HEAVEN
AND
ONE
HELL
FROM
THAT
PERSPECTIVE
IT
IS
HEAVEN
OR
HELL
YOU
EITHER
GO
TO
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
THE
GRADING
ON
A
PASSFAIL
BASIS
IS
DONE
BY
GOD
THE
FATHER
WITH
INTERVENTION
BY
JESUS
THE
SON
NOT
BY
OTHERS
FOR
ONLY
GOD
SEES
THE
HEART
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
OF
THE
HEART
WHO
CAN
KNOW
IT
I
WOULD
SAY
THERE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
AND
ALWAYS
BE
AN
UNCHANGING
METHOD
THAT
IS
WHAT
MAKES
A
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
CHRIST
SO
SECURE
IN
AN
UNCERTAIN
AND
EVER
CHANGING
LANDSCAPE
HE
IS
ALWAYS
THE
SAME
YESTERDAY
TODAY
AND
TOMORROW
CONCERNING
WHETHER
OR
NOT
OUR
CHILDHOODS
ARE
CONSIDERD
AS
PART
OF
THE
TEST
MY
OWN
CONVICTION
IS
NO
WERE
THAT
THE
CASE
I
CERTAINLY
WOULDNT
BE
GOING
TO
HEAVEN
THE
BIBLE
SPEAKS
VERY
PLAINLY
ABOUT
THE
LOVE
AND
CARE
JESUS
HAD
FOR
AND
ABOUT
CHILDREN
THE
REALITY
IS
THAT
WE
ARE
ALL
CHILDREN
SOME
OF
US
JUST
HAVE
BIGGER
BODIES
AND
GREY
HAIR
BUT
THE
FATHER
OUR
FATHER
IS
ALWAYS
THERE
LIKE
MOST
FATHERS
HE
WANTS
ONLY
THE
BEST
FOR
HIS
OWN
THERE
MAYBE
DECIPLINE
BUT
THERE
IS
MORE
LOVE
ITS
SOMETIMES
LOOKS
LIKE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
A
TEST
TO
SEE
WHO
MAKES
IT
AND
WHO
DOESNT
THOSE
WHO
DO
PASSHEAVEN
AND
THOSE
WHO
DONT
GO
TO
THE
OTHER
PLACE
BUT
IT
IS
REALLY
MUCH
MORE
THAN
THAT
THERE
ARE
FEW
EXPERTS
MOST
OF
US
ARE
JUST
TRAVELERS
LOOKING
FOR
THE
LIGHT
AND
THE
WAY
HOME
PRAYING
THAT
WE
CAN
BRING
OTHERS
WITH
US
