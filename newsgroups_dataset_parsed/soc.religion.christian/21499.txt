CHRISTIANITY
AND
REPEATED
LIVES
THERE
IS
A
PARAGRAPH
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
WHICH
IN
MY
OPINION
CLEARLY
MAKES
A
POSITIVE
INFERENCE
TO
REINCARNATION
I
DONT
REMEMBER
WHICH
ONE
IT
IS
OFF
OF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
BUT
IT
BASICALLY
GOES
LIKE
THIS
JESUS
IS
TALKING
WITH
THE
APOSTLES
AND
THEY
ASK
HIM
WHY
THE
PHARISEES
SAY
THAT
BEFORE
THE
MESSIAH
CAN
COME
ELIJAH
MUST
FIRST
COME
JESUS
REPLIES
THAT
ELIJAH
HAS
COME
BUT
THEY
DID
NOT
RECOGNIZE
HIM
IT
THEN
SAYS
THAT
THE
APOSTLES
PERCEIVED
THAT
HE
WAS
REFERING
TO
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
THIS
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
CLEARLY
IMPLY
REINCARNATION
THIS
WAS
A
POPULAR
BELIEF
IN
THE
JUDAISM
OF
JESUS
TIME
THAT
ELIJAH
WOULD
RETURN
AGAIN
AS
HE
HAD
BEEN
TAKEN
IN
TO
HEAVEN
IN
A
CHARIOT
AND
DID
NOT
ACTUALLY
DIE
HOWEVER
JESUS
WAS
REFERRING
TO
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
NOT
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
ELIJAH
WAS
REINCARNATED
AS
JOHN
REMEMBER
ELIJAH
DIDNT
DIE
BUT
THAT
JOHN
WAS
A
SIMILAR
PROPHET
TO
ELIJAH
JOHN
WAS
A
FIERY
PREACHER
HE
WORE
SACKCLOTH
AND
WANDERED
ROUGH
THROUGH
ISRAEL
PREACHING
THE
COMING
KINGDOM
THE
VERSES
THAT
DESCRIBE
HIM
IN
MARKS
GOSPEL
CAN
BE
LINKED
TO
OT
REFERENCES
ABOUT
ELIJAH
HENCE
JOHN
WAS
SIMILAR
TO
ELIJAH
AND
JESUS
WAS
DRAWING
THE
PARALLELS
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
JUST
AS
HE
DREW
PARALLELS
WITH
THE
SUFFERING
SERVANT
IN
ISAIAH
AND
OTHER
MESSIANIC
FIGURES
AND
HIMSELF
A
BRIEF
REPLY
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
LOOK
UP
ALL
THE
RELEVANT
STUFF
SUFFICE
TO
SAY
THERE
IS
A
VERY
STRONG
EXPLANATION
