RE
SERBIAN
GENOCIDE
WORK
OF
GOD
NOTE
I
AM
NOT
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
I
AM
JUST
ANSWERING
BECAUSE
I
THINK
THIS
IS
IMPORTANT

ARTICLE

WRITES
EVIL
RESULT
OF
HUMAN
SINFULNESS
RATHER
THAN
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
IN
A
CERTAIN
SENSE
YES
BUT
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
GOD
ALLOWS
EVIL
TO
HAPPEN
WHEN
OBVIOUSLY
HE
BEING
GOD
HE
COULD
HAVE
NOT
HAD
IT
HAPPEN
DOES
IN
A
CERTAIN
SENSE
MEAN
THAT
HE
WILLS
IT
TO
HAPPEN
GOD
DOES
NOT
CONDONE
EVIL
BUT
INSTEAD
USES
IT
FOR
GOOD
AS
YOU
SAY
HOWEVER
WHAT
GOD
DESIRES
MUST
BE
SEPERATED
FROM
WHAT
ACTUALLY
HAPPENS
FOR
EXAMPLE
GOD
DESIRES
THAT
ALL
SHOULD
BE
SAVED
TIMOTHY
HOWEVER
IT
IS
QUITE
OBVIOUS
THAT
NOWHERE
NEAR
ALL
ARE
SAVED
WAS
GODS
WILL
THWARTED
NO
BECAUSE
HIS
WILL
CANNOT
BE
ESCAPED
FOR
EVEN
WHEN
IT
APPEARS
THAT
IT
IS
YOUR
WILL
DOING
SOMETHING
IT
IS
ACTUALLY
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
WHICH
BY
HIS
GRACE
HAS
DISPOSED
US
TO
DO
AS
HE
WISHES
SO
WE
COME
TO
THE
AGE
OLD
QUESTION
WHY
DOES
EVIL
OCCUR
TO
WHICH
WE
MUST
ANSWER
THAT
GOD
ALLOWS
EVIL
TO
OCCUR
THOUGH
HE
DOES
NOT
CONDONE
IT
SO
THAT
HIS
ULTIMATE
PLAN
MAY
BE
BROUGHT
TO
SUCESS
PERSONALLY
I
SUGGEST
READING
THE
PARTS
OF
THE
SUMMA
THEOLOGICA
OF
ST
THOMAS
THAT
DEAL
WITH
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
GOD
TO
GET
A
GOOD
GRASP
ON
THIS
WHOLE
IDEA
WHOO
IM
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
WITH
MY
LANGUAGE
HERE
I
THINK
GOD
IS
VOLUNTARILY
GIVING
UP
HIS
OMNISCIENCE
IN
THIS
WORLD
SO
THAT
WE
CAN
DECIDE
ON
OUR
OWN
WHERE
WE
GO
FREE
WILL
IN
THIS
SENSE
GOD
ALLOWS
EVIL
TO
OCCUR
AND
IN
THIS
SENSE
CAN
BE
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
AS
MY
CHAPLAIN
SAYS
HOWEVER
HIS
WILL
IS
OF
COURSE
THAT
ALL
BE
SAVED
HES
NOT
GOING
TO
SAVE
US
BY
HIMSELF
WE
HAVE
TO
TAKE
A
STEP
IN
HIS
DIRECTION
BEFORE
HE
WILL
SAVE
US
READ
THAT
LAST
SENTENCE
CAREFULLY
IM
NOT
SAYING
WE
SAVE
OURSELVES
IM
SAYING
WE
HAVE
TO
ACCEPT
OUR
SALVATION
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
PREDESTINATION
IT
WOULD
APPEAR
FROM
WHAT
YOU
SAY
FURTHER
DOWN
THAT
YOU
DO
STUFF
DELETED
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
ANYONE
DESERVES
PUNISHMENT
MORE
THAN
SOMEONE
ELSE
I
AM
SIMPLY
POINTING
OUT
THAT
GOD
COULD
BE
USING
THE
SERBIANS
AND
CROATIANS
AS
INSTRUMENTS
OF
HIS
PUNISHMENT
AS
HE
DID
WITH
THE
ISRAELITES
AGAINST
THE
CANNANITES
OK
I
HAVE
TROUBLE
WITH
THAT
BUT
I
GUESS
THATS
ONE
OF
THOSE
THINGS
THAT
CANT
BE
RESOLVED
BY
ARGUMENT
I
ACCEPT
YOUR
INTERPRETATION
MORE
DELETED
THE
ISSUE
IS
NOT
QUESTIONING
WHY
GOD
HAS
MADE
THE
WORLD
IN
THE
WAY
GOD
SO
CHOOSES
IT
IS
WHETHER
I
AM
DISCERNING
THE
WORLD
IN
THE
WAY
GOD
INTENDS
IT
THE
DEBATE
IS
ABOUT
WHETHER
WE
SHOULD
NOT
OPPOSE
THE
SERBIANS
IN
THEIR
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
BECAUSE
THEY
MIGHT
BE
DOING
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
AND
I
SAID
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
PARTICIPANTS
IN
SUCH
WARS
AND
SLAUGHTERS
THAT
DOES
NOT
MITIGATE
THE
FACT
THAT
GOD
ALLOWS
THIS
EVIL
TO
CONTINUE
FOR
HE
IS
PATIENT
AND
WILLING
THAT
NONE
SHOULD
PERISH
SO
HE
WAITS
FOR
THOSE
WHOM
HE
HAS
FOREKNOWN
TO
TURN
TO
HIM
FROM
THEIR
EVIL
THIS
IS
WHAT
INDICATES
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
MAY
BELIEVE
IN
PREDESTINATION
AM
I
CORRECT
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
PREDESTINATION
I
BELIEVE
WE
ALL
CHOOSE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
WE
WILL
ACCEPT
GODS
GIFT
OF
SALVATION
TO
US
AGAIN
FUNDAMENTAL
DIFFERENCE
WHICH
CANT
REALLY
BE
RESOLVED
YET
MORE
DELETED
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
THE
EVIL
BEFALLING
THE
BOSNIANS
IS
JUSTIFIED
BY
THEIR
GUILT
I
AM
SAYING
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
GOD
IS
PUNISHING
THEM
IN
THIS
WAY
IN
NO
WAY
IS
THIS
EVIL
JUSTIFIED
BU
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
GOD
CANNOT
USE
EVIL
TO
FURTHER
HIS
PURPOSES
I
AM
NOT
ACCUSING
THE
BOSNIANS
THOUGH
THEY
MAY
VERY
WELL
BE
GUILTY
OF
GREAT
SINS
BUT
THAT
IS
UP
TO
GOD
TO
JUDGE
WE
ARE
ALL
DEFENDANTS
WHEN
THE
TIME
COMES
FOR
OUR
JUDGEMENT
BY
GOD
LET
US
ALL
SINCERELY
HOPE
AND
PRAY
THAT
WE
WILL
HAVE
JESUS
CHRIST
AS
OUR
ADVOCATE
AT
THAT
JUDGEMENT
YES
IT
IS
UP
TO
GOD
TO
JUDGE
BUT
HE
WILL
ONLY
METE
OUT
THAT
PUNISHMENT
AT
THE
LAST
JUDGEMENT
AS
FOR
NOW
EVIL
CAN
BE
DONE
BY
HUMAN
BEINGS
THAT
IS
NOT
GODS
WILL
AND
THE
BEST
WE
CAN
DO
IS
SEE
TAHT
SOME
GOOD
COMES
OUT
OF
IT
SOMEHOW
THE
THING
THAT
MOST
WORRIES
ME
ABOUT
THE
IT
IS
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
THIS
WILL
CONVINCE
PEOPLE
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NOT
STOP
THE
RAPE
AND
KILLING
WHEN
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
MOST
CHRISTLIKE
TO
DO
JUST
THAT
IF
JESUS
STOPPED
THE
STONING
OF
AN
ADULTEROUS
WOMAN
PERHAPS
THIS
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
PARALLEL
BUT
IM
GOING
TO
GO
WITH
IT
ANYWAY
WHY
SHOULD
WE
NOT
STOP
THE
MURDER
AND
VIOLATION
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
