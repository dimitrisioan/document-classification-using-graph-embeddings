CHARLEY
WINGATE
WRITES
SEEING
AS
HOW
THETWOBABYLONS
HAS
BEEN
BROUGHT
UP
AGAIN
ITS
SCHOLARSHIP
IS
PHONY
AND
ITS
ASSERTIONS
SPURIOUS
C
WINGATE
MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
DIG
A
LITTLE
FURTHER
CHARLES
HISLOPS
SCHOLARSHIP
WAS
ACCEPTED
BY
THE
BRISTISH
ORIENTAL
INSTITUTE
WHICH
AT
THE
TIME
WAS
THE
PREMERE
INSTITUTE
FOR
ORIENTAL
STUDIES
AS
IVE
STATED
OVER
AND
OVER
IVE
CHECKED
OUT
ABOUT
OF
HIS
REFERENCES
MOST
ARE
NOW
OUT
OF
PRINT
OR
IN
PRIVATE
LIBRARIES
AND
THE
LIKES
OF
WILKERSON
AND
LAYARD
HOLD
THEIR
OWN
MERIT
THEY
TOO
CAME
TO
THE
SAME
CONCLUSIONS
AND
IF
YOU
WILL
TROUBLE
YOURSELF
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
THEIR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
MYSTERIES
HAVE
YET
TO
BE
SURPASSED
BOTH
WERE
HIGHLY
HONORED
BY
THE
BRITISH
ORIENTAL
MUSEUM
WILKERSON
IS
KNOWN
AS
ONE
OF
THE
LEADING
ARCHEOLOGIST
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
EGYPTIOLOGY
AND
LAYARD
IS
STILL
BEING
REFERED
TWO
AFTER
YRS
OF
ARCHEOLOGY
IN
THE
MESOPOTAMIAN
REGIONS
HE
WAS
RECENTLY
REFERED
TO
IN
A
TIME
ARTICLE
ON
BABYLONIAN
ARCHEOLOGY
PHONY
SCHOLARSHIP
IS
WHEN
YOU
REVIEW
THEIR
REFERENCES
AND
FIND
THAT
THEY
HAVE
MISQUOTED
OR
MISREPRESENTED
THE
CONCLUSIONS
HISLOP
DID
NOT
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
DO
NOT
TICKLE
THE
EARS
THAT
MUCH
IS
SELF
EVIDENT
BUT
TO
ASSERT
THAT
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
ARE
SPURIOUS
IS
WITHOUT
MERIT
HE
GAVE
REFERENCES
TO
ALL
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
AND
AS
I
HAVE
STATED
FOR
THE
LAST
YEARS
I
HAVE
USED
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
IN
DEBATES
AT
RC
SEMINARIES
AND
BROTHERHOODS
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PRIESTS
AND
BISHOPS
THAT
I
HAVE
TALKED
TO
ONE
ON
ONE
NO
COUNTER
TO
HISLOPS
SCHOLARSHIP
WAS
MADE
THE
ONLY
REBUTTALS
WERE
AGAINST
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
BECAUSE
THEY
DO
TOTALLY
UNDERMINED
THE
CLAIMS
OF
THE
RCC
HE
WAS
SHOWING
THAT
THE
INTITUTION
OF
THE
RCC
WAS
BASED
ON
THE
MYSTERIES
WHICH
OTHERS
HAVE
SHOWN
EVEN
TO
THIS
DAY
IN
VARIOUS
ARTICLES
AND
TOPICS
THE
TONGUES
MOVEMENT
IN
CORINTH
WAS
A
DIRECT
RESULT
OF
THE
MYSTERIES
ENTERING
INTO
THE
CHURCH
IF
IT
WAS
SO
IN
CORINTH
WHY
COULD
THEY
NOT
HAVE
AN
INFLUENCE
IN
ROME
THE
CITY
OF
SEVEN
HILLS
ALSO
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
TO
LISTEN
TO
HIS
CONCLUSIONS
YOU
CAN
DRAW
YOUR
OWN
CONCLUSIONS
BY
LOOKING
AT
THE
CUSTOMS
ARTIFACTS
THE
CERIMONIAL
DRESS
THE
DOCRINE
OF
PURGATORY
ETC
FROM
THE
VANTAGE
OF
THE
MYSTERIES
YOU
DONT
EVEN
HAVE
TO
BE
A
BELIEVER
TO
SEE
THE
PARALLELS
JUST
ONE
EXAMPLE
THE
MITRE
WHERE
DID
IT
COME
FROM
WHY
IS
IT
SHAPED
THE
WAY
IT
IS
WHAT
ARE
THE
TWO
TAILS
THAT
HANG
DOWN
THE
BACK
REPRESENT
WAS
THIS
AN
ANCIENT
HEAD
DRESS
FROM
AN
EARLIER
CULTURE
AND
WHY
WAS
IT
IN
ROME
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
BEGINNINGS
OF
THE
CHURCH
OF
THE
STATE
OF
ROME
DOES
IT
HAVE
PAGAN
HISTORY
BEHIND
IT
AND
IF
SO
WHY
DID
THE
RCC
CHOSE
REGARDLESS
ANY
LAY
PERSON
OF
MIDDLE
EASTERN
RELIGION
CAN
ANSWER
THESE
QUESTIONS
EVEN
THE
SCRIPTURES
THEMSELVES
REFER
TO
IT
ALL
HISLOP
DID
WAS
COLLECT
THE
INFORMATION
FROM
ALL
THE
VARIOUS
SOURCES
AND
PUT
THEM
IN
ONE
BINDING
THERE
IS
NO
LACK
OF
SCHOLORSHIP
IN
THAT
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHY
YOU
DISCREDIT
THIS
MAN
BY
YOUR
ACCUSATION
YET
PRESENT
NO
EVIDENCE
SUPPORTING
IT
