WHAT
WAS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
IN

I
HAVE
QUITE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
IDEA
THAT
MARY
NEVER
COMMITTED
A
SIN
WAS
MARY
FULLY
HUMAN
IF
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
GOD
TO
MIRACULOUSLY
MAKE
A
PERSON
FREE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
AND
FREE
OF
COMMITTING
SIN
THEIR
WHOLE
LIFE
THEN
WHAT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
INCARNATION
OF
JESUS
WHY
CANT
GOD
JUST
REPEAT
THE
MIRACLE
DONE
FOR
MARY
TO
MAKE
ALL
THE
REST
OF
US
SINLESS
WITHOUT
THE
NEED
FOR
REPENTANCE
AND
SALVATION
AND
ALL
THAT
YES
MARY
IS
FULLY
HUMAN
HOWEVER
THAT
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THAT
SHE
WAS
JUST
AS
SUBJECT
TO
SIN
AS
WE
ARE
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
SAYS
THAT
MANS
NATURE
IS
GOOD
GEN
BUT
IS
DAMAGED
BY
ORIGINAL
SIN
ROM
IN
THAT
CASE
BEING
UNDAMAGED
BY
ORIGINAL
SIN
MARY
IS
MORE
FULLY
HUMAN
THAN
ANY
OF
THE
REST
OF
US
YOU
ASK
WHY
GOD
CANNOT
REPEAT
THE
MIRACLE
OF
MARYS
PRESERVATION
FROM
ORIGINAL
SIN
A
BETTER
WAY
TO
PHRASE
IT
WOULD
BE
WHY
DID
HE
NOT
DO
IT
THAT
WAY
BUT
YOU
MISUNDERSTAND
HOW
MARYS
SALVATION
WAS
OBTAINED
LIKE
OURS
THE
BLESSED
VIRGIN
MARYS
SALVATION
WAS
OBTAINED
THROUGH
THE
MERITS
OF
THE
SACRIFICE
OF
CHRIST
ON
THE
CROSS
HOWEVER
AS
GOD
IS
NOT
BOUND
BY
TIME
WHICH
IS
HIS
CREATION
GOD
IS
FREE
TO
APPLY
HIS
SACRIFICE
TO
ANYONE
AT
ANY
TIME
EVEN
IF
THAT
PERSON
LIVED
BEFORE
CHRIST
CAME
TO
EARTH
FROM
OUR
TIMEBOUND
PERSPECTIVE
THEREFORE
CHRISTS
DEATH
AND
RESURRECTION
STILL
SERVED
A
NECESSARY
PURPOSE
AND
WERE
NECESSARY
EVEN
FOR
MARYS
SALVATION
