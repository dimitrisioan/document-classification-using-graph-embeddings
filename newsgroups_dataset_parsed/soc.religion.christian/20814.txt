WRITES
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
POST
TO
THIS
PARTICULAR
NEWSGROUP
ARE
EITHER
TOO
COWARDLY
MORE
ACCUSATIONS
ABOUT
A
WORLDWIDE
CONSPIRACY
AGAINST
BLACKS
SINCE
JESUS
WAS
BORN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
THEN
I
EXPECT
HIS
HUMAN
FEATURES
TO
BE
SIMILAR
TO
MIDDLE
EASTERNERS
AT
THAT
POINT
IN
TIME
AND
SINCE
THE
CAMERA
WASNT
INVENTED
YET
WE
CAN
ONLY
GUESS
WHAT
HE
LOOKED
LIKE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WITH
ALL
THE
DINOSAUR
BONES
WERE
DIGGING
UP
WE
STILL
DONT
KNOW
IF
THEY
WERE
YELLOWPOLKADOTTED
OR
PURPLISHORANGE
LIKEWISE
I
DONT
THINK
ANYBODY
HAS
A
PICTURE
OF
JESUS
IS
THERE
SO
OUR
CURRENT
IMAGE
OF
JESUS
IS
OUR
BEST
GUESS
OKAY
SO
LETS
ASSUME
THAT
JESUS
IS
BLACK
WOULD
THAT
MAKE
YOU
FOLLOW
HIS
TECHINGS
CAUSE
IF
YOU
FOLLOW
HIS
TEACHINGS
SKIN
COLOR
BECOMES
A
MOOT
POINT
ANYWAY
WHAT
COUNTS
MORE
IN
YOUR
LIFE
YOUR
FAITH
IN
JESUS
OR
HIS
SKIN
COLOR
AS
A
HUMAN
IN
THE
INTEREST
OF
HISTORICAL
ACCURACY
HOWEVER
SINCE
JESUS
WAS
FROM
ISRAEL
WOULDNT
HIS
SKIN
COLOR
BE
LIKE
ANY
OTHER
JEW
IE
FAIRSKINNED
ALTHOUGH
PROBABLY
HEAVILY
TANNED
FROM
THE
DESERT
SUN
