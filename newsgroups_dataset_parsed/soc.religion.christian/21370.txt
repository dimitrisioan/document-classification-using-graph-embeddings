MATTHEW
HUNTBACH
WRITES
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
CLAIMS
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
AUTHENTICATED
CASES
OF
PEOPLE
MAKING
PROLONGED
SPEECHES
IN
REAL
LANGUAGES
THEY
DONT
KNOW
FROM
MY
OBSERVATIONS
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
IN
PRACTICE
HAS
NOTHING
AT
ALL
DO
WITH
THIS
I
HAVE
A
SIMPLE
TEST
I
TAKE
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
SPEAK
ONLY
ONE
LANGUAGE
EG
CHINESE
RUSSIAN
GERMAN
ENGLISH
THEN
I
LET
THE
GIFTED
ONE
START
SPEAKING
IN
TOUNGUES
THE
AUDIENCE
SHOULD
UNDERSTAND
THE
GIFTED
ONE
CLEARLY
IN
THEIR
NATIVE
LANGUAGE
HOWEVER
THE
GIFTED
ONE
CAN
ONLY
HEAR
HIMSELF
SPEAKING
IN
HIS
OWN
LANGUAGE
THERE
SEEM
TO
BE
MANY
POINTS
TO
THE
SPEAKING
IN
TONGUES
THING
WHICH
ARE
PROBLEMATIC
ITS
USE
AS
PRAYER
LANGUAGE
SEEMS
ESPECIALLY
TROUBLING
TO
ME
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
WHEN
YOU
PRAY
IN
TONGUES
THE
SPIRIT
IS
DOING
THE
TALKING
AND
WHEN
YOU
PRAY
YOU
PRAY
TO
GOD
AND
THE
SPIRIT
IS
GOD
SO
THE
SPIRIT
IS
TALKING
TO
HIMSELF
WHICH
IS
WHY
I
ONLY
GO
BY
THE
PENTECOST
USE
WHERE
ITS
AN
ACTUAL
LANGUAGE
MOREOVER
THE
PHRASE
THOUGH
I
SPEAK
WITH
THE
TONGUES
OF
MEN
AND
ANGELS
USED
BY
PAUL
IN
I
COR
IS
MISLEADING
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
SOME
WOULD
THEN
ASSUME
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
ANGELIC
TONGUE
AND
IF
WHEN
THEY
SPEAK
IT
IS
NO
KNOWN
LANGUAGE
THEN
IT
IS
AN
ANGELIC
TONGUE
HMMMIN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
STORY
ABOUT
THE
TOWER
OF
BABEL
WE
SEE
HOW
GOD
PUNISHED
BY
GIVING
US
DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE
CAN
WE
ASSUME
THEN
THAT
IF
ANGELS
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
LANGUAGE
AT
ALL
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THE
SAME
ONE
AMONGST
OTHER
ANGELS
AFTER
ALL
THEY
WERE
NOT
PUNISHED
IN
ANY
MANNER
SO
WHY
DO
THESE
SUPPOSED
ANGELIC
TONGUES
ALL
SOUND
DIFFERENT
FROM
ONE
ANOTHER
ITS
DISTURBING
TO
THINK
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
FIND
WAYS
TO
JUSTIFY
JABBERING
BUT
ILL
BUY
THE
IDEA
THAT
SOMEONE
COULD
TALK
IN
A
LANGUAGE
NEVER
LEARNED
TROUBLE
IS
WHILE
SUCH
STORIES
ABOUND
ANY
AND
ALL
ATTEMPTS
AT
VERIFICATION
AND
WE
ARE
TO
TEST
THE
SPIRIT
EITHER
SHOW
THAT
THE
WITNESS
HAD
NO
REAL
IDEA
OF
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OR
THAT
OUTRIGHT
FABRICATION
WAS
INVOLVED
THE
BROTHER
PUKA
STORY
IN
A
PREVIOUS
POST
SEEMS
LIKE
A
FRIEND
OF
A
FRIEND
THING
AND
LINGUISTICALLY
A
TWO
SYLLABLE
WORD
HARDLY
QUALIFIES
AS
LANGUAGE
INFLECTION
OR
NO
MUCH
AS
MANY
FAITH
HEALERS
HAVE
TROUBLE
PROVING
THEIR
VICTORIES
SINCE
MOST
AILMENTS
CURED
ARE
JUST
PLAIN
UNPROVABLE
AND
MODERN
DAY
RESSURRECTIONS
HAVE
NEVER
BEEN
VALIDATED
SO
IS
IT
TRUE
THAT
NO
MODERN
DAY
XENOGLOSSOLALIA
HAS
BEEN
PROVED
BY
CLERGY
OR
LAY
