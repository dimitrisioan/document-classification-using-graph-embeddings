on
the
question
does
god
hear
the
prayers
of
sinners
we
need
to
distinguish
if
we
say
that
he
never
hears
the
prayers
of
any
who
have
sinned
we
make
pointless
all
prayers
by
anyone
born
less
than
centuries
ago
but
if
we
consider
the
prayers
of
the
impenitent
sinner
of
someone
who
says
lord
i
want
you
to
do
this
for
me
but
dont
expect
me
to
change
my
way
of
life
that
is
a
different
matter
i
have
no
doubt
that
god
hears
everybodys
prayers
however
he
does
things
his
way
ie
things
will
happen
only
if
it
is
his
will
now
if
the
question
really
is
does
god
grant
everybodys
wishes
then
youll
get
a
brutal
shot
of
reality
similar
to
when
you
didnt
get
that
toy
you
wanted
for
christmas
you
just
cannot
expect
to
get
everything
you
want
in
this
world
