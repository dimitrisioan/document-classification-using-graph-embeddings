WRITES
PAUL
REPEATEDLY
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
THORN
IN
HIS
SIDE
SOME
THINK
IT
REFERS
TO
LUST
OTHERS
PRIDE
BUT
WHO
KNOWS
WHATEVER
THE
THORN
WAS
APPARENTLY
IT
WAS
NOT
COMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
YET
DOES
THAT
MAKE
HIS
EPISTLES
ANY
LESS
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
PAULS
THORN
IN
THE
FLESH
WAS
A
SIN
IN
HIS
LIFE
THAT
MAKES
LITTLE
SENSE
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
PAUL
WRITINGS
TAKEN
IN
TOTALITY
HE
WRITES
OF
HOW
HE
PRESSES
FOR
THE
MARK
AND
KEEPS
HIS
BODY
SUBMITTED
NO
DOUBT
PAUL
HAD
TO
STRUGGLE
WITH
THE
FLESH
JUST
LIKE
EVERY
CHRISTIAN
PAUL
DOES
ASSOCIATE
HIS
THORN
WITH
A
SATANIC
MESSENGER
AND
WITH
PHYSICAL
INFIRMITIES
AND
TRIBULATION
BUT
NOT
WITH
A
SIN
IN
HIS
LIFE
