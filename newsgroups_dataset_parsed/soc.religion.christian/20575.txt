OF

WRITES
FIRSTLY
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
I
AM
NOT
POSTING
HERE
AS
AN
IMMATURE
FLAME
START
BUT
RATHER
TO
EXPRESS
AN
OPINION
TO
MY
INTENDED
AUDIENCE
STRONG
OPINIONS
START
HERE
THE
HUMAN
BEING
IS
AN
ANIMAL
WHO
HAS
DUE
TO
HISHER
ADVANCED
MENTAL
FACILITIES
DEVELOPED
RELIGION
AS
A
SATISFIABLE
SOLUTION
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
UNEXPLAINABLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
ANCIENT
GREEKS
BELIEVED
THAT
APOLLO
DROVE
HIS
CHARIOT
ACROSS
THE
SKY
EACH
DAY
WAS
REAL
DUE
TO
THE
ADVANCEMENT
OF
OUR
TECHNOLOGY
WE
KNOW
THIS
TO
BE
FALSE
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
A
VALID
OBJECTION
TO
RELIGIONASEXPLANATIONOF
NATURE
FORTUNATELY
FOR
THE
CONVENIENCE
OF
US
BELIEVERS
THERE
IS
A
CLASS
OF
QUESTIONS
THAT
CAN
NEVER
BE
REDUCED
AWAY
BY
NATURAL
SCIENCE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
DOES
THE
UNIVERSE
EXIST
AT
ALL
AFTER
ALL
THE
TIMESPACE
WORLD
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
EXIST
WHY
DOES
ANYTHING
EXIST
AND
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
PERSONS
EG
MAN
TO
COME
INTO
BEING
OUT
OF
A
PURELY
IMPERSONAL
COSMOS
THESE
QUESTIONS
WHICH
LOOK
AT
THE
REAL
MYSTERIES
OF
LIFE
THE
CREATION
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
OF
PERSONS
PROVIDE
A
PERMANENT
INDICATOR
THAT
THE
MEANING
OF
LIFE
IN
THE
MATERIAL
WORLD
CAN
ONLY
BE
FOUND
OUTSIDE
THAT
WORLD
IN
ITS
SOURCE
WE
ARE
JUST
ANIMALS
WE
NEED
SLEEP
FOOD
AND
WE
REPRODUCE
AND
WE
DIE
RELIGION
ESPECIALLY
CHRISTIANITY
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
DRUG
SOME
PEOPLE
USE
DRUGS
AS
AN
ESCAPE
FROM
REALITY
CHRISTIANS
INJECT
THEMSELVES
WITH
JEEZUS
AND
LIVE
WITH
THAT
HIGH
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
MAN
IS
ONLY
AN
ANIMAL
I
HAVE
TO
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
PRESENTING
AN
UNPROVABLE
STATEMENT
A
DOGMA
IF
YOU
WILL
AND
ONE
THE
REQUIRES
A
KIND
OF
FAITH
TOO
BY
TAKING
SUCH
A
HARD
LINE
IN
YOUR
ATHEISM
YOU
MAY
HAVE
STUMBLED
INTO
A
RELIGION
OF
YOUR
OWN
BUT
BEFORE
YOU
WRITE
OFF
ALL
CHRISTIANITY
AS
PHONY
AND
SHALLOW
I
HOPE
YOULL
DO
A
LITTLE
RESEARCH
INTO
ITS
HISTORY
AND
VARIETIES
PERHAPS
BY
READING
PAUL
JOHNSONS
A
HISTORY
OF
CHRISTIANITY
FROM
YOUR
REMARKS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
EXPOSED
TO
CERTAIN
TYPES
OF
CHRISTIAN
RELIGION
AND
NOT
OTHERS
EVEN
AN
ATHEIST
SHOULD
HAVE
ENOUGH
FAITH
IN
MAN
TO
KNOW
THAT
A
MOVEMENT
OF
YEARS
HAS
TO
HAVE
SOME
DEPTH
AND
BE
ANIMATED
BY
SOME
ENDURING
VALUES
WITH
BEST
