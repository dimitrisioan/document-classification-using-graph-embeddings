RAISED

AND

BY

FUNDAMENTALIST
CHRISTIAN
PARENTS
MASON
WAS
BEATEN
AS
A
CHILD
HE
ONCE
WAS
WERE
THE
SAN
JOSE
MERCURY
NEWS
TO
COME
OUT
WITH
AN
ARTICLE
STARTING
WITH
RAISED
IN
OAKLAND
BY
MEXICAN
PARENTS
MASON
WAS
BEATEN
MY
FACE
WOULD
BE
RED
WITH
ANGER
OVER
THE
INJUSTICE
DONE
TO
MY
MEXICAN
FAMILY
MEMBERS
AND
ALTHOUGH
IM
NEITHER
FUNDAMENTALIST
NOR
EVANGELICAL
I
HAVE
OFTEN
NOTICED
THIS
TREND
IN
THE
MEDIA
IN
SHORT
IT
IS
PERMISSABLE
TO
BASH
FUNDAMENTALISTS
NO
NEED
TO
SUBSTITUE
A
NATIONALITY
SUCH
AS
MEXICAN
TRY
SIMPLY
TO
SUBSTITUTE
A
DIFFERENT
RELIGION
RAISED
BY
MUSLIM
PARENTS
OR
RAISED
BY
JEWISH
PARENTS
THE
PAPER
SIMPLY
WOULD
NOT
DO
THIS
I
HAVE
NOTICED
THAT
NEWSPAPERS
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
A
FUNDAMENTALIST
IS
AT
THE
LEAST
THEY
CONFUSE
NEW
EVANGELICALS
AND
FUNDAMENTALISTS
IN
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
THE
LIBERALS
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
A
FUNDAMENTALIST
IS
CRYING
OUT
LEGALIST
AT
ANYONE
WHO
BELIEVES
AND
OBEYS
GODS
WORD
A
FUNDAMENTALIST
WOULD
TRAIN
THEIR
CHILDREN
IN
THE
WAY
GOD
PROSCRIBES
NOT
IN
THE
WAY
THAT
MAN
PROSCRIBES
THIS
WOULD
NOT
INCLUDE
LIFE
THREATENING
BEATINGS
BUT
WOULD
INCLUDE
CORPORAL
PUNISHMENT
TO
THE
LIBERALS
I
CRY
OUT
INFIDEL
AT
ANYONE
WHO
DOES
NOT
BELIEVE
GODS
WORD
SIGNATURE
FOLLOWS
YOUR
STATUTES
ARE
WONDERFUL
THEREFORE
I
OBEY
THEM
PSALM
DAVID
L
HANSON
ANY
OPINIONS
EXPRESSED
ARE
MY
OWN
AS
MOST
PEOPLE
HERE
KNOW
I
BELIEVE
FUNDAMENTALIST
IS
SUFFICIENTLY
ILLDEFINED
THAT
I
ADVISE
USING
SOME
MORE
SPECIFIC
TERM
I
THINK
MANY
PEOPLE
USE
IT
TO
COVER
PEOPLE
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
INERRANCY
AND
A
NUMBER
OF
RELATED
CONCEPTS
EG
DENIAL
OF
EVOLUTION
WHILE
THE
ORIGINAL
FUNDAMENTALS
MOVEMENT
WAS
SOMEWHAT
MORE
SPECIFIC
I
WOULD
THINK
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
ACCEPT
INERRANCY
WOULD
ACTUALLY
SUPPORT
THE
WHOLE
ORIGINAL
AGENDA
IT
INCLUDED
A
LIST
OF
KEY
TRADITIONAL
DOCTRINES
EG
THE
VIRGIN
BIRTH
THE
TERM
IS
NOW
BEING
USED
BY
THE
PRESS
TO
DESCRIBE
AGGRESSIVE
CONSERVATIVE
RELIGIONS
IN
GENERAL
MOST
TYPICALLY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
LEGISLATE
RELIGION
LEGALISM
IS
YET
ANOTHER
ILLDEFINED
TERM
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
SOME
REASON
FOR
ITS
USE
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
IN
FACT
THE
COMMON
THEOLOGICAL
DEFINITION
IS
THE
BELIEVE
THAT
SALVATION
IS
THROUGH
THE
LAW
I
HOPE
NO
ONE
HERE
BELIEVES
THAT
OUR
CONSERVATIVE
CONTRIBUTORS
HOLD
THIS
VIEW
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
A
BASIC
DIFFERENCE
IN
APPROACH
OVER
WHAT
WE
EXPECT
TO
GET
OUT
OF
THE
BIBLE
THE
CONSERVATIVE
APPROACH
EXPECTS
TO
FIND
SPECIFIC
BEHAVIORAL
RULES
GENERALLY
THE
POSTERS
ADVOCATING
THIS
APPROACH
TALK
ABOUT
THE
RELEVANT
PASSAGES
FROM
PAULS
LETTER
AS
GODS
LAW
THE
LIBERAL
APPROACH
EXPECTS
TO
FIND
GENERAL
PRINCIPLES
BUT
IT
REGARDS
SPECIFIC
BEHAVIORAL
RULES
SUBJECT
TO
CHANGE
DEPENDING
UPON
THE
CULTURE
AND
OTHER
THINGS
ITS
EASY
TO
SEE
WHY
A
LIBERAL
WOULD
REGARD
THE
CONSERVATIVE
APPROACH
AS
LEGALISM
ITS
HARD
TO
KNOW
QUITE
WHAT
OTHER
TERM
TO
USE
THE
ISSUE
IN
THIS
CASE
IS
NOT
INERRANCY
BECAUSE
NO
ONE
IS
SAYING
THAT
PAUL
MADE
A
FACTUAL
ERROR
RATHER
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
HIS
STATEMENTS
ARE
TO
BE
TAKEN
AS
LAW
CALLING
THE
POSITIVE
ANSWER
LEGALISM
SEEMS
OBVIOUS
ENOUGH
TERMINOLOGY
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ANY
GOOD
ALTERNATIVE
