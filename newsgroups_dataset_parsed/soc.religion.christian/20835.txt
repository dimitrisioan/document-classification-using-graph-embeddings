book
review
wanted
im
interested
if
anyone
out
here
can
point
me
towards
a
review
of
the
following
book
in
any
scholarly
christian
journal
whether
it
be
conservative
or
liberal
protestant
or
catholic
thelostyearsofjesus
documentary
evidence
for
jesus
year
journey
to
the
east
by
elizabeth
clare
prophet
supposedly
this
is
a
theory
that
was
refuted
in
the
past
and
she
has
reexamined
it
i
thought
this
was
just
another
novel
book
but
i
saw
it
listed
as
a
text
for
a
class
in
religious
studies
here
also
the
endorsements
seem
to
come
from
some
credible
sources
so
im
wondering
if
scholars
have
reviewed
it
or
anyone
on
the
net
for
that
matter
