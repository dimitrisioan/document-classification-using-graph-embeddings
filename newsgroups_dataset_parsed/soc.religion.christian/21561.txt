we

how

punished

can
we
assume
then
that
if
angels
have
their
own
language
at
all
that
they
have
the

one
amongst
other
angels
after
all
they
were
not
punished
in
any
manner
maybe
before
babeleveryone
including
angels
spoke
the

at

god
punished
us
by
giving
us
languages
different
from
the
original
one
so
if
thats
the

angels
now
would
be
speaking
in
the
tongue
mankind
spoke
before
babel
