RE
MORMON
BELIEFS
ABOUT
BASTARDS
WRITES
COULD
ANYONE
ENLIGHTEN
ME
ON
HOW
THE
MORMON
CHURCH
VIEWS
CHILDREN
BORN
OUT
OF
WEDLOCK
IN
PARTICULAR
IM
INTERESTED
TO
KNOW
IF
ANY
STIGMA
IS
ATTACHED
TO
THE
CHILDREN
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
PARENTS
ALL
CHILDREN
ARE
BORN
PURE
IE
WITHOUT
SIN
HOWEVER
MOST
SAINTS
WOULD
VIEW
A
PREGNANCY
OUTSIDE
OF
MARRIAGE
AS
AN
OCCASION
OF
MOURNING
SOME
CHURCH
MEMBERS
WOULD
BE
MUCH
MORE
JUDGMENTAL
BUT
THAT
IS
THEIR
PROBLEM
IN
SITUATIONS
WHERE
WELFARE
ASSISTANCE
IS
PROVIDED
THROUGH
OUR
CHURCH
BISHOPS
USUALLY
REQUIRE
THAT
THE
FAMILY
BE
MAKING
SOME
EFFORT
TO
LIVE
THE
GOSPEL
STANDARDS
AND
PROVIDE
FOR
THEMSELVES
HOWEVER
THERE
ARE
OCCASIONS
WHEN
ASSISTANCE
IS
PROVIDED
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CHILDREN
IN
THE
HOME
AS
A
FORMER
BISHOP
OF
MINE
SAID
CHILDREN
ARE
ALWAYS
WORTHY
BEFORE
GOD
IM
ESPECIALLY
KEEN
TO
LEARN
IF
THERE
IS
OR
IS
NOT
ANY
PROHIBITION
IN
THE
MORMON
FAITH
ON
BASTARDS
ENTERING
HEAVEN
OR
HAVING
THEIR
NAMES
ENTERED
IN
THE
BIG
GENEALOGICAL
BOOK
THE
MORMONS
KEEP
IN
SALT
LAKE
CITY
I
AM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
THE
TERM
BASTARDS
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
LATTERDAY
SAINTS
BELIEVE
THAT
THROUGH
THE
TEMPLE
ORDINANCES
THE
FAMILY
UNIT
MAY
BE
PRESERVED
IN
ETERNITY
IF
YOU
USE
GENEALOGICAL
MATERIAL
OR
SOFTWARE
PRODUCED
BY
THE
CHURCH
YOU
MAY
NOTICE
A
SECTION
FOR
TEMPLE
ORDINANCES
WITHIN
THAT
SECTION
THERE
SHOULD
BE
A
SPOT
FOR
SIGNIFYING
BIC
WHICH
STANDS
FOR
BORN
IN
THE
COVENANT
THE
CHILDREN
BORN
TO
COUPLE
SEALED
MARRIED
WITHIN
THE
TEMPLE
ARE
BORN
IN
THE
COVENANT
AND
ARE
ELIGIBLE
TO
BE
PART
OF
THAT
ETERNAL
FAMILY
UNIT
CHILDREN
BORN
TO
OTHER
COUPLES
WHETHER
IN
A
CIVIL
MARRIAGE
OR
NOT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
SEALED
TO
THEIR
PARENTS
AFTER
THEIR
MARRIAGE
IS
SOLEMNIZED
FOR
ETERNITY
SUPPOSING
A
CHILD
WERE
BORN
TO
A
WOMAN
OUT
OF
WEDLOCK
HE
OR
SHE
COULD
BE
SEALED
TO
HIS
OR
HER
PARENTS
AT
A
LATER
DATE
OR
ADOPTED
INTO
ANY
ETERNAL
FAMILY
UNIT
WHICH
MAY
INCLUDE
ONE
OF
THE
BIRTH
PARENTS
IF
THIS
IS
AN
ISSUE
ON
WHICH
THE
OFFICIAL
POSITION
HAS
CHANGED
OVER
TIME
IM
INTERESTED
IN
LEARNING
BOTH
OLD
AND
NEW
BELIEFS
EMAIL
OR
POSTING
IS
FINE
ALL
INFORMATION
OR
POINTERS
ARE
APPRECIATED
I
CANT
SAY
IF
THIS
PRINCIPLE
OF
ADOPTION
WAS
REVEALED
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AS
THE
SEALING
ORDINANCES
BUT
IT
HAS
BEEN
ACCEPTED
FOR
THE
YEARS
I
HAVE
BEEN
IN
THE
CHURCH
I
WOULD
TEND
TO
DISCOUNT
ANY
ADMONITIONS
FROM
THE
CHURCH
AUTHORITIES
AGAINST
HAVING
CHILDREN
OUT
OF
WEDLOCK
BECAUSE
EVEN
THOUGH
THERE
ARE
PROVISIONS
WITHIN
THE
LORDS
PLAN
TO
RECOVER
WHAT
WE
HAVE
DONE
WRONG
THE
CHURCH
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
GIVE
ANYONE
THE
IMPRESSION
WE
CAN
SIN
AND
REPENT
AT
OUR
LEISURE
A
IDLER
