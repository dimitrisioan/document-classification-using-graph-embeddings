re
quality
of
catholic
liturgy

i
would
like
the
opinion
of
netters
on
a
subject
that
has
been
bothering
my
wife
and
me
lately
liturgy
in
particular
catholic
liturgy
in
the
last
few
years
it
seems
that
there
are
more
and
more
ad
hoc
events
during
mass
its
driving
me
crazy
the
most
gracefilled
aspect
of
a
liturgical
tradition
is
that
what
happens
is
something
we
all
do
together
because
we
all
know
how
to
do
it
led
by
the
priest
of
course
which
makes
it
a
kind
of
dialogue
we
present
to
god
but
the
best
masses
ive
been
to
were
participatory
prayers
having
lived
through
the
kicking
and
screaming
in
the
and
as
the
catholics
were
invited
to
participate
in
the
liturgy
instead
of
counting
their
rosary
beads
during
mass
i
find
this
comment
interesting
there
is
a
massively
longer
tradition
for
proclaiming
the
passion
accounts
without
active
participation
if
you
know
the
latin
one
really
beautiful
way
to
hear
the
passion
is
its
being
chanted
by
three
deacons
the
narrator
chants
in
the
middle
baritone
range
jesus
chants
in
the
bass
and
others
directly
quoted
are
handled
by
a
high
tenor
this
is
actually
the
basis
for
the
common
proclamation
of
the
passion
that
john
would
prefer
but
there
is
always
a
judgement
call
based
on
pastoral
considerations
each
pastor
makes
his
own
decisions
it
isnt
a
churchwide
conspiracy
against
participation
the
palm
sunday
liturgy
with
its
initial
blessing
and
distribution
of
the
palms
and
procession
is
already
getting
long
before
you
get
to
the
passion
some
pastors
feel
that
they
should
not
make
the
people
stand
through
that
long
narrative
also
the
orchestrated
proclamation
with
multiple
readers
and
public
participation
in
the
crowd
quotations
runs
longer
than
the
singlereader
proclamation
in
churches
with
multiple
masses
for
the
sunday
it
might
be
necessary
to
go
with
the
briefer
options
just
to
get
em
in
and
get
em
out
each
parish
is
different
catholics
are
no
longer
canonically
tied
to
their
geographic
parishes
it
is
possible
that
another
catholic
parish
in
the
columbus
area
based
on
the
ohio
state
address
has
a
liturgy
closer
to
your
preferences
or
talk
to
some
of
your
fellow
parishioners
and
see
how
common
your
preferences
are
pastors
generally
are
willing
to
listen
to
nonconfrontational
requests
though
you
probably
should
bring
along
a
paramedic
in
case
he
reacts
too
strongly
to
the
shock
of
people
asked
for
a
longer
sunday
mass
perhaps
the
problem
is
that
recent
liturgical
development
hasnt
follow
the
continuous
evolution
model
the
accumulation
of
small
changes
no
single
one
of
which
is
too
hard
to
take
but
rather
the
punctuated
equilibrium
model
things
stay
the
same
and
we
get
accustomed
to
them
then
the
marked
mutation
hits
my
apologies
if
i
am
misremembering
the
names
of
the
evolutionary
theories
