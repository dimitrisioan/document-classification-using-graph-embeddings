NO
IMO
MR
STOWELL
MISSED
THE
POINT
WE
AFFIRM
THE
ABSOLUTES
OF
SCRIPTURE
NOT
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
ARROGANT
MORALISTS
BUT
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
WHO
IS
TRUTH
WHO
HAS
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTH
IN
HIS
WORD
AND
THEREFORE
WE
HOLD
AS
PRECIOUS
THE
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
OF
THOSE
ABSOLUTES
MR
STOWELL
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
JUMPED
RATHER
STRANGELY
FROM
TRUTH
TO
ABSOLUTES
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
THAT
NECESSARILY
FOLLOWS
ARE
ALL
TRUTHS
ALSO
ABSOLUTES
IS
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
TRUTHS
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTES
IF
THE
ANSWER
TO
EITHER
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
IS
NO
THEN
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
HOW
YOU
DETERMINE
WHICH
PARTS
OF
SCRIPTURE
ARE
TRUTHS
AND
WHICH
TRUTHS
ARE
ABSOLUTES
THE
ANSWER
TO
BOTH
QUESTIONS
IS
YES
ALL
SCRIPTURE
IS
TRUE
BEING
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
THE
EVIDENCE
FOR
THIS
CLAIM
HAS
BEEN
DISCUSSED
AD
NAUSEUM
IN
THIS
GROUP
SIMILARLY
ALL
TRUTH
IS
ABSOLUTE
INDEED
A
NONABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IS
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
WHEN
IS
SOMETHING
ABSOLUTE
WHEN
IT
IS
ALWAYS
TRUE
OBVIOUSLY
IF
A
TRUTH
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
TRUE
THEN
WE
HAVE
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
MANY
PEOPLE
CLAIM
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
WORLD
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
IS
TERRIBLY
SELFCONTRADICTORY
LET
ME
PUT
IT
TO
YOU
THIS
WAY
IF
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
SHOULDNT
WE
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
STATEMENT
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
IS
NOT
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE
OBVIOUSLY
WE
HAVE
A
CONTRADICTION
HERE
THIS
IS
JUST
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
WHY
CHRISTIANS
DEFY
THE
WORLD
BY
CLAIMING
THAT
THERE
ARE
INDEED
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
UNIVERSE
THERE
IS
HARDLY
CONSENSUS
EVEN
IN
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANITY
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
REST
OF
CHRISTIANITY
REGARDING
BIBLICAL
INTERPRETATION
SO
PEOPLE
SOMETIMES
DISAGREE
ABOUT
WHAT
IS
TRUE
THIS
DOES
NOT
NEGATE
THE
FACT
HOWEVER
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL
ABSOLUTES
IN
THE
UNIVERSE
MOREOVER
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANITY
AT
LEAST
STILL
PROFESSES
TO
BELIEVE
IN
CERTAIN
TRUTHS
MAN
IS
SINFUL
MAN
NEEDS
SALVATION
AND
JESUS
IS
THE
PROPITIATION
FOR
MANKINDS
SINS
TO
NAME
A
FEW
ANY
GROUP
THAT
DOES
NOT
PROFESS
TO
BELIEVE
THESE
STATEMENTS
CANNOT
BE
ACCURATELY
