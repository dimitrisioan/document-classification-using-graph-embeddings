RE
AM
I
GOING
TO
HELL
IN
TIM
ASKS
I
HAVE
STATED
BEFORE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
MYSELF
AN
ATHEIST
BUT
DEFINITELY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
COMBINED
WITH
A
POST
TO
ANOTHER
GROUP
TO
THE
EFFECT
OF
YOU
WILL
ALL
GO
TO
HELL
HAS
ME
INTERESTED
IN
THE
CONSENSUS
AS
TO
HOW
A
GOD
MIGHT
JUDGE
MEN
AS
A
CATHOLIC
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
A
JEW
BUDDHIST
ETC
MIGHT
GO
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
OBVIOUSLY
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THIS
EVEN
MORE
SEE
ATHEISTS
AND
PAGANS
I
ASSUME
I
WOULD
BE
LUMPED
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
TO
BE
HELLBOUND
I
KNOW
YOU
BELIEVE
ONLY
GOD
CAN
JUDGE
AND
I
DO
NOT
ASK
YOU
TO
JUST
FOR
YOUR
OPINIONS
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
TOO
SIMPLISTIC
FOR
SOME
BUT
JOHN
SAUS
FOR
GOD
SO
LOVED
THE
WORLD
THAT
HE
GAVE
HIS
ONLY
SON
THAT
WHOEVER
BELIEVES
IN
HIM
SHOULD
NOT
PERISH
BUT
HAVE
ETERNAL
LIFE
GENESIS
AND
HE
ABRAM
BELIEVED
THE
LORD
AND
HE
RECKONED
IT
TO
HIM
AS
RIGHTEOUSNESS
I
DONT
FIND
ANYWHERE
THAT
GOD
RESTRICTS
HEAVEN
TO
PARTICULAR
ETHNIC
GROUPS
OR
RELIGIOUS
DENOMINATIONS
OR
ANY
OTHER
CATEGORY
THAT
WE
HUMANS
LIKE
TO
DROP
PEOPLE
INTO
BUT
HE
DOES
REQUIRE
THAT
WE
BELIEVE
AND
TRUST
HIM
IN
HEBREWS
IT
SAYS
THAT
GOD
SPOKE
OF
OLD
BY
THE
PROPHETS
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
BUT
IN
THESE
LAST
DAYS
HE
HAS
SPOKEN
TO
US
BY
HIS
SON
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
WE
LEARN
OF
HIM
THROUGH
THE
PAGES
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
THE
BIBLE
TELLS
US
WHAT
WE
NEED
TO
BELIEVE
FOR
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
I
LEAVE
THEM
IN
GODS
CAPABLE
CARE
HE
WILL
MAKE
HIMSELF
KNOWN
AS
HE
DESIRES
IT
BEHOOVES
EACH
ONE
OF
US
TO
ACT
UPON
THE
KNOWLEDGE
WE
HAVE
IF
YOU
REJECT
THE
CLAIMS
OF
JESUS
AND
STILL
GO
TO
HEAVEN
THEN
THE
JOKES
ON
ME
IF
YOU
REJECT
HIM
AND
GO
TO
HELL
THATS
NO
JOKE
BUT
IT
WILL
BE
FINAL
GERRY
THE
OPINIONS
EXPRESSED
ARE
NOT
NECESSARILY
THOSE
OF
MY
EMPLOYER
