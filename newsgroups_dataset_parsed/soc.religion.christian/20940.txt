in
a
short
poem
god
in
his
mercy
made
the
fixed
pains
of
hell
c
s
lewis
expresses
an
idea
that
im
sure
was
current
among
others
but
i
havent
be
able
to
find
its
source
that
even
hell
is
an
expression
of
mercy
because
god
limits
the
amount
of
separation
from
him
and
hence
the
amount
of
agony
that
one
can
achieve
i
have
also
heard
it
called
an
expression
of
mercy
because
heaven
would
be
far
more
agonizing
for
those
who
had
rejected
god
