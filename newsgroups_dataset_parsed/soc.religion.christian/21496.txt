SOMEONE

MY
FAQ
ESSAY
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
SINCE
IT
HASNT
BEEN
POSTED
FOR
SOME
TIME
AND
IVE
MODIFIED
IT
SOMEWHAT
SINCE
THE
LAST
TIME
IM
TAKING
THIS
OPPORTUNITY
TO
POST
IT
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
ENTRY
IN
THE
FAQ
CONTAINING
COMMENTS
BY
SOME
OTHER
CONTRIBUTORS
THEY
CAN
BE
RETRIEVED
FROM

AS
PUBSOCRELIGIONCHRISTIANOTHERSHOMOSEXUALITY
IT
CONTAINS
FAR
MORE
DETAIL
ON
THE
EXEGETICAL
ISSUES
THAN
I
GIVE
HERE
THOUGH
PRIMARILY
FROM
A
CONSERVATIVE
POINT
OF
VIEW
THIS
POSTING
SUMMARIZES
SEVERAL
ISSUES
INVOLVING
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
CHRISTIANS
THIS
IS
A
FREQUENTLY
ASKED
QUESTION
SO
I
DO
NOT
POST
THE
QUESTION
EACH
TIME
IT
OCCURS
RATHER
THIS
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
SUMMARIZE
THE
POSTINGS
WE
GET
WHEN
WE
HAVE
A
DISCUSSION
IT
SUMMARIZES
ARGUMENTS
FOR
ALLOWING
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
SINCE
MOST
PEOPLE
ASKING
THE
QUESTION
ALREADY
KNOW
THE
ARGUMENTS
AGAINST
IT
THE
MOST
COMMON
BUT
NOT
THE
ONLY
QUESTION
DEALT
WITH
HEREIN
IS
HOW
CAN
A
CHRISTIAN
JUSTIFY
BEING
A
HOMOSEXUAL
GIVEN
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
ABOUT
IT
FIRST
ON
THE
DEFINITION
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
MANY
GROUPS
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
IE
A
SEXUAL
ATTRACTION
TO
MEMBERS
OF
THE
SAME
SEX
THIS
IS
DISTINGUISHED
FROM
ACTUAL
HOMOSEXUAL
SEXUAL
ACTIVITY
HOMOSEXUALS
WHO
ABSTAIN
FROM
SEX
ARE
CONSIDERED
BY
MOST
GROUPS
TO
BE
ACCEPTABLE
HOWEVER
IN
A
LOT
OF
DISCUSSION
THE
TERM
HOMOSEXUAL
MEANS
SOMEONE
ACTUALLY
ENGAGING
IN
HOMOSEXUAL
SEX
THIS
IS
GENERALLY
NOT
ACCEPTED
OUTSIDE
THE
MOST
LIBERAL
GROUPS
IN
THIS
PAPER
IM
GOING
TO
USE
HOMOSEXUAL
AS
MEANING
A
PERSON
ENGAGING
IN
SEXUAL
ACTS
WITH
ANOTHER
OF
THE
SAME
SEX
I
HAVENT
HEARD
OF
ANY
BIBLICAL
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
A
PERSON
WITH
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
WHO
REMAINS
CELEBATE
I
THINK
MOST
PEOPLE
NOW
ADMIT
THAT
THERE
IS
A
PREDISPOSITION
TO
BE
HOMOSEXUAL
THIS
IS
OFTEN
CALLED
A
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
IT
IS
NOT
KNOWN
WHETHER
IT
IS
GENETIC
OR
ENVIRONMENTAL
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
SUGGESTING
EACH
THE
BEST
EVIDENCE
IVE
SEEN
IS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
NOT
A
SINGLE
PHENOMENON
BUT
HAS
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
CAUSES
ONE
OF
THEM
IS
PROBABLY
GENETIC
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
GROUPS
THAT
TRY
TO
HELP
PEOPLE
MOVE
FROM
BEING
HOMOSEXUAL
TO
HETEROSEXUAL
THE
BESTKNOWN
IS
EXODUS
INTERNATIONAL
THE
REPORTS
IVE
SEEN
AND
I
HAVENT
READ
THE
DETAILED
LITERATURE
JUST
THE
SUMMARY
IN
THE
MINORITY
OPINION
TO
THE
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCHS
INFAMOUS
REPORT
ON
HUMAN
SEXUALITY
SUGGEST
THAT
THESE
PROGRAMS
HAVE
VERY
LOW
SUCCESS
RATES
AND
THAT
THERE
ARE
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
HOW
REAL
EVEN
THE
SUCCESSES
ARE
BUT
THERE
CERTAINLY
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
SAY
THEY
HAVE
CONVERTED
HOWEVER
THIS
ISSUE
IS
NOT
AS
IMPORTANT
AS
IT
SOUNDS
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
WRONG
BELIEVE
IT
IS
INTRINSICALLY
WRONG
DEFINED
AS
SUCH
BY
GOD
THE
FACT
THAT
ITS
HARD
TO
GET
OUT
OF
BEING
A
HOMOSEXUAL
IS
NO
MORE
RELEVANT
THAN
THE
FACT
THAT
ITS
HARD
TO
ESCAPE
FROM
BEING
A
DRUG
ADDICT
IF
ITS
WRONG
ITS
WRONG
IT
MAY
AFFECT
HOW
WE
DEAL
WITH
PEOPLE
THOUGH
IF
ITS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
CHANGE
THIS
MAY
TEND
TO
MAKE
US
MORE
WILLING
TO
FORGIVE
IT
ONE
MORE
GENERAL
BACKGROUND
ISSUE
ITS
COMMON
TO
QUOTE
A
FIGURE

OF
THE
POPULATION
IS

HOWEVER
THE

AND
I

A

OTHER
GROUPS
MAY
AS

THE
EPISCOPAL
CHURCH
SEEMS
TO
ACCEPT
IT
SOME
AREAS
BUT
NOT
OTHERS
IN

THAT
HAVE

YOULL
FIND

HOW

THIS
IS
ANOTHER

I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
DOUBT
THAT
THERE
ARE
HOMOSEXUAL

THE

IN

HAS
BEEN
JOHN
BOSWELL
CHRISTIANITY
SOCIAL
TOLERANCE
AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
U
CHICAGO
PRESS
THE
ARGUMENT
AGAINST
IS
PRETTY
CLEAR
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
EXPLICIT
LAWS
IN
THE
OT
EG
LEVITICUS
AND
IN
ROM
PAUL
SEEMS
PRETTY
NEGATIVE
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
BEYOND
THESE
REFERENCES
THERE
ARE
SOME
DEBATES
SOME
PASSAGES
OFTEN
CITED
ON
THE
SUBJECT
PROBABLY
ARE
NOT
RELEVANT
EG
THE
SIN
WHICH
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
SODOM
PROPOSED
TO
CARRY
OUT
WAS
HOMOSEXUAL
RAPE
NOT
HOMOSEXUAL
ACTIVITY
BETWEEN
CONSENTING
ADULTS
THERES
EVEN
SOME
QUESTION
WHETHER
IT
WAS
HOMOSEXUAL
SINCE
THE
ENTITIES
INVOLVED
WERE
ANGELS
IT
WAS
PARTICULARLY
HORRIFYING
BECAUSE
IT
INVOLVED
GUESTS
AND
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
TOWARDS
GUESTS
IN
THAT
CULTURE
WAS
VERY
STRONG
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
THE
REASON
LOT
OFFERED
HIS
DAUGHTER
IT
WAS
BETTER
TO
GIVE
UP
HIS
DAUGHTER
THAN
TO
ALLOW
HIS
GUESTS
TO
BE
ATTACKED
IF
YOU
LOOK
THROUGH
A
CONCORDANCE
FOR
REFERENCES
TO
SODOM
ELSEWHERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
YOULL
SEE
THAT
FEW
SEEM
TO
IMPLY
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
WAS
THEIR
SIN
THERES
A
JEWISH
INTERPRETIVE
TRADITION
THAT
THE
MAJOR
SIN
WAS
ABUSE
OF
GUESTS
AT
ANY
RATE
THERES
NO
DEBATE
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
RAPE
IS
WRONG
I
DO
NOT
DISCUSS
LEVITICUS
BECAUSE
THE
LAW
THERE
IS
PART
OF
A
SET
OF
LAWS
THAT
MOST
CHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
BINDING
SO
UNLESS
NT
JUSTIFICATION
CAN
BE
FOUND
LEV
ALONE
WOULD
NOT
SETTLE
THE
ISSUE
THE
NT
REFERENCES
ARE
ALL
IN
PAULS
LETTERS
A
NUMBER
OF
THE
REFERENCES
FROM
PAUL
ARE
LISTS
OF
SINS
IN
WHICH
THE
WORDS
ARE
FAIRLY
VAGUE
BOSWELL
ARGUES
THAT
THE
WORDS
OCCURING
IN
THESE
LISTS
DO
NOT
MEAN
HOMOSEXUAL
HERES
WHAT
HE
SAYS
THE
TWO
GREEK
WORDS
THAT
APPEAR
IN
THE
LISTS
IE
I
COR
AND
I
TIM
ARE
MALAKOS
AND
ARSENOKOITAI
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
CLEAR
WHAT
THE
WORDS
ACTUALLY
MEAN
MALAKOS
WITH
A
BASIC
MEANING
OF
SOFT
HAS
A
VARIETY
OF
METAPHORICAL
MEANINGS
IN
ETHICAL
WRITING
BOSWELL
SUGGESTS
WANTON
AS
A
LIKELY
EQUIVALENT
HE
ALSO
REPORTS
THAT
THE
UNANIMOUS
INTERPRETATION
OF
THE
CHURCH
INCLUDING
GREEKSPEAKING
CHRISTIANS
WAS
THAT
IN
THIS
PASSAGE
IT
REFERRED
TO
MASTURBATION
A
MEANING
THAT
HAS
VANISHED
ONLY
IN
THE
CENT
AS
THAT
PRACTICE
HAS
COME
TO
BE
LESS
FROWNEDUPON
HE
CITES
REFERENCES
AS
LATE
AS
THE
EDITION
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
ENCYCLOPEDIA
THAT
IDENTIFY
IT
AS
MASTURBATION
HE
TRANSLATES
ARSENOKOTAI
AS
MALE
PROSTITUTE
GIVING
EVIDENCE
THAT
NONE
OF
THE
CHURCH
FATHERS
UNDERSTOOD
THE
TERM
AS
REFERRING
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
GENERAL
A
MORE
TECHNICAL
MEANING
SUGGESTED
BY
THE
EARLY
LATIN
TRANSLATIONS
WOULD
BE
ACTIVE
MODE
HOMOSEXUAL
MALE
PROSTITUTE
BUT
IN
HIS
VIEW
PAUL
DID
NOT
INTEND
IT
SO
TECHNICALLY
FOR
A
MORE
CONSERVATIVE
VIEW
I
CONSULTED
GORDON
FEES
COMMENTARY
ON
I
COR
HE
CITES
EVIDENCE
THAT
MALAKOS
OFTEN
MEANT
EFFEMINATE
HOWEVER
BOSWELL
WARNS
US
THAT
IN
GREEK
CULTURE
EFFEMINATE
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
SYNONYMOUS
WITH
HOMOSEXUAL
THOUGH
IT
MAY
BE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
SOME
KINDS
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
GIVEN
WHAT
BOSWELL
AND
FEE
SAY
TAKEN
TOGETHER
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
TERM
IS
SIMPLY
NOT
VERY
DEFINITE
AND
THAT
WHILE
IT
APPLIES
TO
HOMOSEXUALS
IN
SOME
CASES
IT
ISNT
A
GENERAL
TERM
FOR
HOMOSEXUALITY
WHILE
FEE
ARGUES
AGAINST
BOSWELL
WITH
ARSENOKOTAI
AS
WELL
HE
ENDS
UP
SUGGESTING
A
TRANSLATION
THAT
SEEMS
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
THE
BIG
PROBLEM
WITH
IT
IS
THAT
THE
WORD
IS
ALMOST
NEVER
USED
PAULS
WRITING
IS
THE
FIRST
OCCURENCE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
WORD
IS
CLEARLY
COMPOSED
OF
MALE
AND
FK
UNFORTUNATELY
DOESNT
QUITE
TELL
US
THE
MEANING
SINCE
IT
DOESNT
TELL
US
WHETHER
THE
MALE
IS
THE
SUBJECT
OR
OBJECT
OF
THE
ACTION
EXAMPLES
OF
COMPOUND
WORDS
FORMED
EITHER
WAY
CAN
BE
GIVEN
IN
THEORY
IT
COULD
REFER
TO
RAPISTS
ETC
ITS
DANGEROUS
TO
BASE
MEANING
PURELY
ON
ETYMOLOGY
OR
YOULL
CONCLUDE
THAT
GOODBYE
IS
A
RELIGIOUS
EXPRESSION
BECAUSE
ITS
BASED
ON
GOD
BY
WITH
YE
HOWEVER
SINCE
BOSWELL
FEE
AND
NIV
SEEM
TO
AGREE
ON
HOMOSEXUAL
MALE
PROSTITUTE
THAT
SEEMS
AS
GOOD
A
GUESS
AS
ANY
NOTE
THAT
THIS
TRANSLATION
MISSES
THE
STRONG
VULGARITY
OF
THE
TERM
HOWEVER
SOMETHING
WHICH
FEE
AND
BOSWELL
AGREE
ON
BUT
DO
NOT
ATTEMPT
TO
REPRODUCE
IN
THEIR
TRANSLATION
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
STRONGEST
NT
REFERENCE
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
ROMANS
BOSWELL
POINTS
OUT
THAT
ROM
SPEAKS
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
SOMETHING
THAT
HAPPENED
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
NATURALLY
HETEROSEXUAL
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THEIR
CORRUPTION
DUE
TO
WORSHIPPING
FALSE
GODS
ONE
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
AN
EXAMPLE
THAT
IF
A
HOMOSEXUAL
WORSHIPPED
FALSE
GODS
HE
WOULD
ALSO
FALL
INTO
DEGRADATION
AND
PERHAPS
BECOME
HETEROSEXUAL
HOWEVER
I
FIND
THIS
ARGUMENT
SOMEWHAT
FORCED
AND
IN
FACT
OUR
HOMOSEXUAL
READERS
HAVE
NOT
SERIOUSLY
PROPOSED
THAT
THIS
IS
WHAT
PAUL
MEANT
HOWEVER
I
AM
NOT
CONVINCED
THAT
ROM
IS
SUFFICIENT
TO
CREATE
A
LAW
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALITY
FOR
CHRISTIANS
WHAT
PAUL
IS
DESCRIBING
IN
ROM
IS
NOT
HOMOSEXUALITY
AMONG
CHRISTIANS
ITS
HOMOSEXUALITY
THAT
APPEARED
AMONG
IDOLATERS
AS
ONE
PART
OF
A
WHOLE
PACKAGE
OF
WICKEDNESS
DESPITE
THE
IMPRESSION
LEFT
BY
HIS
IMPASSIONED
RHETORIC
IM
SURE
PAUL
DOES
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
PAGANS
COMPLETELY
ABANDONED
HETEROSEXUAL
SEX
GIVEN
HIS
DESCRIPTION
OF
THEIR
SITUATION
I
RATHER
ASSUME
THAT
THEIR
HETEROSEXUAL
SEX
WOULD
ALSO
BE
DEBASED
AND
SHAMELESS
SO
YES
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
PASSAGE
INDICATES
A
NEGATIVE
VIEW
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
IN
ALL
FAIRNESS
THE
SHAMELESS
NATURE
OF
THEIR
ACTS
IS
A
REFLECTION
OF
THE
GENERAL
SPIRITUAL
STATE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AND
NOT
A
SPECIFIC
FEATURE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
MY
OVERALL
VIEW
OF
THE
SITUATION
IS
THE
FOLLOWING
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
ENOUGH
EVIDENCE
TO
BE
CONFIDENT
THAT
PAUL
DISAPPROVED
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
ROM
SEEMS
CLEAR
WHILE
I
COR
AND
I
TIM
ARE
NOT
UNAMBIGUOUS
AND
GENERAL
CONDEMNATIONS
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
THEY
DO
NOT
SEEM
LIKE
WORDING
THAT
WOULD
COME
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
APPROVED
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
OR
EVEN
CONSIDERED
IT
ACCEPTABLE
IN
SOME
CASES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
NONE
OF
THESE
PASSAGES
CONTAINS
EXPLICIT
TEACHINGS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
ROM
IS
REALLY
ABOUT
IDOLATRY
IT
REFERS
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
PASSING
THE
RESULT
OF
THIS
SITUATION
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
INTERPRET
THESE
PASSAGES
IN
LIGHT
OF
THEIR
GENERAL
APPROACH
TO
SCRIPTURE
FOR
THOSE
WHO
LOOK
TO
SCRIPTURE
FOR
LAWS
ABOUT
ISSUES
SUCH
AS
THIS
IT
NOT
SURPRISING
THAT
THEY
WOULD
CONSIDER
THESE
PASSAGES
TO
BE
NT
ENDORSEMENT
OF
THE
OT
PROHIBITION
FOR
THOSE
WHOSE
APPROACH
TO
THE
BIBLE
IS
MORE
LIBERAL
IT
IS
NOT
SURPRISING
THAT
THEY
REGARD
PAULS
NEGATIVE
VIEW
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
SOMETHING
THAT
HE
TOOK
FROM
HIS
JEWISH
UPBRINGING
WITHOUT
ANY
SERIOUS
REEXAMINATION
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
GOSPEL
AS
READERS
OF
THIS
GROUP
KNOW
BY
NOW
THE
ASSUMPTIONS
BEHIND
THESE
APPROACHES
ARE
SO
RADICALLY
DIFFERENT
THAT
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
FOAM
AT
THE
MOUTH
WHEN
THEY
SEE
THE
OPPOSING
VIEW
DESCRIBED
THERES
NOT
A
LOT
I
CAN
DO
AS
MODERATOR
ABOUT
SUCH
A
SITUATION
A
NUMBER
OF
DISCUSSIONS
IN
THE
PAST
CENTERED
AROUND
THE
SORT
OF
DETAILED
EXEGESIS
OF
TEXTS
THAT
IS
DESCRIBED
ABOVE
HOWEVER
IN
FACT
IM
NOT
CONVINCED
THAT
DEFENDERS
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
ACTUALLY
BASE
THEIR
OWN
BELIEFS
ON
SUCH
ANALYSES
THE
REAL
ISSUE
SEEMS
TO
REST
ON
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
PAULS
JUDGEMENT
SHOULD
APPLY
TO
MODERN
HOMOSEXUALITY
ONE
COMMONLY
MADE
CLAIM
IS
THAT
PAUL
HAD
SIMPLY
NEVER
FACED
THE
KINDS
OF
QUESTIONS
WE
ARE
TRYING
TO
DEAL
WITH
HE
ENCOUNTERED
HOMOSEXUALITY
ONLY
IN
CONTEXTS
WHERE
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
PROBABLY
AGREE
THAT
IT
WAS
WRONG
HE
HAD
NEVER
FACED
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
WHO
TRY
TO
ACT
STRAIGHT
AND
FAIL
AND
HE
HAD
NEVER
FACED
CHRISTIANS
WHO
ARE
TRYING
TO
DEFINE
A
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
WHICH
FITS
WITH
GENERAL
CHRISTIAN
IDEALS
OF
FIDELITY
AND
OF
SEEING
SEXUALITY
AS
A
MIRROR
OF
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
GOD
AND
MAN
IT
IS
UNFAIR
TO
TAKE
PAULS
JUDGEMENT
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
AMONG
IDOLATERS
AND
USE
IT
TO
MAKE
JUDGEMENTS
ON
THESE
QUESTIONS
ANOTHER
IS
THE
FOLLOWING
IN
PAULS
TIME
HOMOSEXUALITY
WAS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
NUMBER
OF
THINGS
THAT
CHRISTIANS
WOULD
NOT
FIND
ACCEPTABLE
IT
WAS
PART
OF
TEMPLE
PROSTITUTION
AMONG
PRIVATE
CITIZENS
IT
OFTEN
OCCURED
BETWEEN
ADULTS
AND
CHILDREN
OR
FREE
PEOPLE
AND
SLAVES
IM
NOT
IN
A
POSITION
TO
SAY
THAT
IT
ALWAYS
DID
BUT
THERE
ARE
SOME
REASONS
TO
THINK
SO
THE
ANCIENTS
DISTINGUISHED
BETWEEN
THE
ACTIVE
AND
PASSIVE
PARTNER
IT
WAS
CONSIDERED
DISGRACEFUL
FOR
A
FREE
ADULT
TO
ACT
AS
THE
PASSIVE
PARTNER
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
THAT
AN
ACTIVE
MODE
HOMOSEXUAL
PROSTITUTE
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
DISGRACEFUL
HIS
CUSTOMERS
WOULD
ALL
BE
PEOPLE
WHO
ENJOYED
THE
PASSIVE
ROLE
THIS
SUPPORTS
THE
IDEA
THAT
IT
WOULD
TEND
NOT
TO
BE
ENGAGED
IN
BETWEEN
TWO
FREE
ADULT
MALES
AT
LEAST
NOT
WITHOUT
SOME
DEGREE
OF
SCANDAL
CLEARLY
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALS
WOULD
NOT
CONDONE
SEX
WITH
CHILDREN
SLAVES
OR
OTHERS
WHO
ARE
NOT
IN
A
POSITION
TO
BE
FULLY
RESPONSIBLE

HOWEVER
FEES
COMMENTARY
ON
I
COR
CITES
SOME
EXAMPLES
FROM
ANCIENT
LITERATURE
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS
THAT
DO
SEEM
TO
INVOLVE
FREE
ADULTS
IN
A
REASONABLY
SYMMETRICAL
WAY
THUS
THE
CONSIDERATIONS
IN
THIS
PARAGRAPH
SHOULDNT
BE
PUSHED
TOO
FAR
HOMOSEXUALITY
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
DISCREDITED
FOR
JEWS
BY
SOME
OF
THESE
ASSOCIATIONS
BUT
THERE
SURELY
MUST
BE
BEEN
CASES
THAT
WERE
NOT
PROSTITUTES
AND
DID
NOT
INVOLVE
SLAVES
OR
CHILDREN
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
ARGUED
THAT
AIDS
IS
A
JUDGEMENT
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALITY
ID
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
AIDS
IS
TRANSMITTED
BY
PROMISCUOUS
SEX
BOTH
HOMOSEXUAL
AND
HETEROSEXUAL
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
A
HOMOSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIP
THAT
MEETS
CHRISTIAN
CRITERIA
FOR
MARRIAGE
IS
NOT
AT
RISK
FOR
AIDS
NOTE
THAT
THERE
IS
GOOD
REASON
FROM
PAULS
GENERAL
APPROACH
TO
DOUBT
THAT
HE
WOULD
CONCEDE
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
A
FULLY
EQUAL
ALTERNATIVE
APART
FROM
ANY
SPECIFIC
STATEMENTS
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
I
BELIEVE
HIS
USE
OF
THE
GENESIS
STORY
WOULD
LEAD
HIM
TO
REGARD
HETEROSEXUAL
MARRIAGE
AS
WHAT
GOD
ORDAINED
HOWEVER
THE
WAY
PAUL
DEALS
WITH
PASTORAL
QUESTIONS
PROVIDES
A
WARNING
AGAINST
BEING
TOO
QUICK
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
ISSUE
LEGALLY
I
CLAIM
THAT
THE
QUESTION
OF
HOW
TO
COUNSEL
HOMOSEXUAL
CHRISTIANS
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
A
THEOLOGICAL
ISSUE
BUT
ALSO
A
PASTORAL
ONE
PAULS
TENDENCY
AS
WE
CAN
SEE
IN
ISSUES
SUCH
AS
EATING
MEAT
AND
CELEBRATING
HOLIDAYS
IS
TO
BE
UNCOMPROMISING
ON
PRINCIPLE
BUT
IN
PASTORAL
ISSUES
TO
LOOK
VERY
CAREFULLY
AT
THE
GOOD
OF
THE
PEOPLE
INVOLVED
AND
TO
AVOID
INSISTING
ON
PERFECTION
WHEN
IT
WOULD
BE
PERSONALLY
DAMAGING
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHILE
PAUL
CLEARLY
BELIEVED
THAT
IT
WAS
ACCEPTABLE
TO
EAT
MEAT
HE
WANTED
US
TO
AVOID
PUSHING
PEOPLE
INTO
DOING
AN
ACTION
ABOUT
WHICH
THEY
HAD
PERSONAL
QUALMS
FOR
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
PAUL
OBVIOUSLY
WOULD
HAVE
PREFERRED
TO
SEE
PEOPLE
AT
LEAST
IN
SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES
REMAIN
UNMARRIED
YET
IF
THEY
WERE
UNABLE
TO
DO
SO
HE
CERTAINLY
WOULD
RATHER
SEE
THEM
MARRIED
THAN
IN
A
STATE
WHERE
THEY
MIGHT
BE
TEMPTED
TO
FORNICATION
I
BELIEVE
ONE
COULD
TAKE
A
VIEW
LIKE
THIS
EVEN
WHILE
ACCEPTING
THE
VIEWS
PAUL
EXPRESSED
IN
ROM
ONE
MAY
BELIEVE
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
NOT
WHAT
GOD
INTENDED
THAT
IT
OCCURED
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SIN
BUT
STILL
CONCLUDE
THAT
AT
TIMES
WE
HAVE
TO
LIVE
WITH
IT
NOTE
THAT
IN
THE
CREATION
STORY
WORK
ENTERS
HUMAN
LIFE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
SIN
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
CHRISTIANS
CAN
STOP
WORKING
WHEN
WE
ARE
SAVED
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
IN
ITSELF
SINFUL
OR
WHETHER
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
ITS
A
MISFORTUNE
THAT
IS
IN
A
BROAD
SENSE
DUE
TO
HUMAN
SINFULNESS
IF
YOURE
WILLING
TO
CONSIDER
THE
LATTER
APPROACH
THEN
IT
BECOMES
A
PASTORAL
JUDGEMENT
WHETHER
THERE
IS
MORE
DAMAGE
CAUSED
BY
FINDING
A
WAY
TO
LIVE
WITH
IT
OR
TRYING
TO
CURE
IT
THE
DANGERS
OF
TRYING
TO
CURE
IT
ARE
THAT
THE
ATTEMPT
MOST
OFTEN
FAILS
AND
WHEN
IT
DOES
YOU
END
UP
WITH
DAMAGE
RANGING
FROM
PSYCHOLOGICAL
DAMAGE
TO
SUICIDE
AS
WELL
AS
BROKEN
MARRIAGES
WHEN
ATTEMPTS
AT
LIVING
AS
A
HETEROSEXUAL
FAIL
THIS
IS
GOING
TO
DEPEND
UPON
ONES
ASSESSMENT
OF
THE
INHERENT
NATURE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
IT
IS
A
VERY
SERIOUS
WRONG
THEN
YOU
MAY
BE
WILLING
TO
RUN
HIGH
RISKS
OF
SERIOUS
DAMAGE
TO
GET
RID
OF
IT
CLEARLY
WE
DO
NOT
GENERALLY
SUGGEST
THAT
PEOPLE
LIVE
WITH
A
TENDENCY
TO
STEAL
OR
WITH
DRUG
ADDICTION
EVEN
THOUGH
ATTEMPTS
TO
CURE
THESE
CONDITIONS
ARE
ALSO
VERY
DIFFICULT
HOWEVER
THESE
CONDITIONS
ARE
INTRINSICALLY
DAMAGING
IN
A
WAY
THAT
IS
NOT
SO
OBVIOUS
FOR
HOMOSEXUALITY
MANY
PROBLEMS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
HOMOSEXUALITY
ARE
ACTUALLY
PROBLEMS
OF
PROMISCUITY
NOT
HOMOSEXUALITY
THIS
INCLUDES
AIDS
I
TAKE
FOR
GRANTED
THAT
THE
ONLY
SORT
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS
A
CHRISTIAN
WOULD
CONSIDER
ALLOWING
WOULD
BE
EQUIVALENT
TO
CHRISTIAN
HETEROSEXUAL
RELATIONSHIPS
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
DISCUSSING
THIS
OVER
THE
LAST
DECADE
OR
SO
WEVE
HEARD
A
LOT
OF
PERSONAL
TESTIMONY
FROM
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
WHO
ARE
IN
THIS
SITUATION
IVE
ALSO
SEEN
SUMMARIES
OF
VARIOUS
RESEARCH
AND
THE
RESULTS
OF
VARIOUS
EFFORTS
FOR
CONVERSION
ASIDE
FROM
THE
PRESBYTERIAN
REPORT
MENTIONED
ABOVE
THERES
AN
FAQ
THAT
SUMMARIZES
OUR
READERS
REPORTS
ON
THIS
QUESTION
THE
EVIDENCE
IS
THAT
LONGTERM
SUCCESS
IN
CHANGING
ORIENTATION
IS
RARE
ENOUGH
TO
BE
ON
A
PAR
WITH
HEALING
MIRACLES
THE
DANGER
IN
ADVISING
CHRISTIANS
TO
DEPEND
UPON
SUCH
A
CHANGE
IS
CLEAR
WHEN
CONVERSION
DOESNT
HAPPEN
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
OFTEN
LEFT
IN
DESPAIR
FEELING
EXCLUDED
FROM
A
CHURCH
THAT
HAS
NOTHING
MORE
TO
SAY
BUT
A
REQUIREMENT
OF
LIFELONG
CELIBACY
PAUL
RECOGNIZED
THOUGH
IN
A
DIFFERENT
CONTEXT
THAT
SUCH
A
DEMAND
IS
NOT
PRACTICAL
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
AND
I
THINK
THE
HISTORY
OF
CLERICAL
CELIBACY
HAS
STRONGLY
REINFORCED
THAT
JUDGEMENT
THE
PRACTICAL
RESULT
IS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALS
END
UP
IN
THE
GAY
SEX
CLUBS
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
SORDID
SIDE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
MAYBE
HOMOSEXUALITY
ISNT
GODS
ORIGINAL
IDEAL
BUT
I
CAN
WELL
IMAGINE
PAUL
PREFERRING
TO
SEE
PEOPLE
IN
LONGTERM
COMMITTED
CHRISTIAN
RELATIONSHIPS
THAN
PROMISCUITY
AS
WITH
WORK
WHICH
GENESIS
SUGGESTS
WASNT
PART
OF
GODS
ORIGINAL
IDEAL
EITHER
I
THINK
SUCH
RELATIONSHIPS
CAN
STILL
BE
A
VEHICLE
FOR
PEOPLE
SHARING
GODS
LOVE
WITH
EACH
OTHER
THERES
AN
ISSUE
OF
BIBLICAL
INTERPRETATION
UNDERLYING
THIS
DISCUSSION
THE
ISSUE
IS
THAT
OF
CULTURAL
RELATIVISM
THAT
IS
WHEN
PAUL
SAYS
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
SHOULD
THIS
BE
TAKEN
AS
AN
ETERNAL
STATEMENT
OR
ARE
THINGS
WRONG
BECAUSE
OF
SPECIFIC
SITUATIONS
IN
THE
CULTURE
OF
THE
TIME
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
GENERALLY
INSIST
ON
TAKING
PROHIBITIONS
AS
ABSOLUTE
SINCE
OTHERWISE
THE
BIBLE
BECOMES
SUBJECTIVE
WHAT
IS
TO
STOP
US
FROM
CONSIDERING
EVERYTHING
IN
IT
AS
RELATIVE
WHEN
LOOKING
AT
THIS
ISSUE
ITS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
NO
ONE
COMPLETELY
REJECTS
THE
CONCEPT
OF
CULTURAL
RELATIVISM
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
JUDGEMENTS
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
THAT
EVEN
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
CONSIDER
TO
BE
RELATIVE
THE
FOLLOWING
JUDGEMENTS
ARE
AT
LEAST
AS
CLEAR
IN
THE
BIBLE
AS
ANYTHING
SAID
ON
HOMOSEXUALITY
PROHIBITION
AGAINST
CHARGING
INTEREST
THIS
OCCURS
TIMES
IN
THE
OT
ITS
NOT
IN
THE
NT
BUT
I
MENTION
IT
HERE
BECAUSE
UNTIL
RELATIVELY
RECENTLY
THE
CHURCH
DID
CONSIDER
IT
BINDING
ON
CHRISTIANS
PROHIBITION
AGAINST
SWEARING
OATHS
ENDORSEMENT
OF
SLAVERY
AS
AN
INSTITUTION
JUDGEMENT
OF
TAX
COLLECTORS
AS
SINNER
WE
DO
NOT
REGARD
THESE
ITEMS
AS
BINDING
IN
MOST
CASES
I
BELIEVE
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
ESSENTIALLY
ONE
OF
CULTURAL
RELATIVISM
BRIEFLY
PROHIBITION
OF
INTEREST
IS
APPROPRIATE
TO
A
SPECIFIC
AGRARIAN
SOCIETY
THAT
THE
BIBLE
WAS
TRYING
TO
BUILD
BUT
NOT
TO
OUR
MARKET
ECONOMY
FEW
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
AMERICAN
JUDICIAL
OATHS
HAVE
THE
SAME
CHARACTERISTICS
AS
THE
KIND
OF
OATHS
JESUS
WAS
CONCERNED
ABOUT
MOST
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
PAUL
WAS
SIMPLY
TELLING
PEOPLE
HOW
TO
LIVE
WITHIN
SLAVERY
BUT
NOT
ENDORSING
IT
AS
AN
INSTITUTION
FOR
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
IRS
IS
MORALLY
EQUIVALENT
TO
ROMAN
TAX
FARMING
THE
POINT
IM
TRYING
TO
MAKE
IS
THAT
BEFORE
APPLYING
BIBLICAL
PROHIBITIONS
TO
THE
CENT
WE
NEED
TO
LOOK
AT
WHETHER
THE
CENT
ACTIONS
ARE
THE
SAME
WHEN
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALS
SAY
THAT
THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE
DIFFERENT
THAN
THE
GREEK
HOMOSEXUALITY
THAT
PAUL
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
FAMILIAR
WITH
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
ARGUMENT
THAT
IS
BEING
MADE
ABOUT
JUDICIAL
OATHS
AND
TAX
COLLECTORS
UNTIL
FAIRLY
RECENTLY
CHRISTIANS
PROHIBITED
TAKING
OF
INTEREST
AND
MANY
CHRISTIANS
REGARDED
SLAVERY
AS
DIVINELY
ENDORSED
INDEED
SLAVERY
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MORE
COMMON
METAPHORS
FOR
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
GOD
AND
HUMAN
BEINGS
CHRISTIANS
ARE
OFTEN
CALLED
SERVANTS
OR
SLAVES
OF
GOD
I
AM
NOT
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
EVERYTHING
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
CULTURALLY
RELATIVE
RATHER
IM
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
SOME
THINGS
ARE
AND
THEREFORE
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
THAT
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
APPEARS
IN
THE
BIBLE
THAT
ENDS
THE
DISCUSSION
WE
NEED
TO
LOOK
AT
WHETHER
THE
ACTION
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
NOW
HAS
THE
SAME
MORAL
IMPLICATIONS
AS
THE
ONE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
WAS
TALKING
ABOUT
IF
CHRISTIANS
WANT
TO
ARGUE
THAT
THERE
ARE
REASONS
TO
THINK
THAT
THE
PROHIBITIONS
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALITY
ARE
STILL
BINDING
IM
WILLING
TO
LISTEN
THOSE
WHO
CLAIM
THAT
THE
QUESTION
DOESNT
NEED
TO
BE
LOOKED
AT
ARE
KIDDING
THEMSELVES
UNLESS
THEY
ARE
PART
OF
THE
SMALL
MINORITY
WHO
REALLY
OBEY
ALL
THE
RULES
LISTED
ABOVE
ONE
THING
THAT
WORRIES
ME
IS
THE
GREAT
EMOTIONS
THAT
THIS
ISSUE
CREATES
WHEN
YOU
CONSIDER
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
THE
BIBLICAL
EVIDENCE
SOME
LAWS
IN
LEVITICUS
A
PASSAGE
IN
ROM
WHOSE
SUBJECT
MATTER
IS
REALLY
IDOLATRY
RATHER
THAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
LISTS
WHOSE
WORDS
ARE
AMBIGUOUS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
CONCERN
THIS
IS
RAISING
AMONG
CHRISTIANS
SEEMS
RATHER
OUT
OF
PROPORTION
THIS
SHOULD
SUGGEST
TO
PEOPLE
THAT
THERE
ARE
REASONS
OTHER
THAN
SIMPLY
BIBLICAL
INVOLVED
THIS
IS
TRUE
ON
BOTH
SIDES
CLEARLY
HOMOSEXUAL
CHRISTIANS
ARE
AS
STRONGLY
MOTIVATED
TO
FIND
WAYS
OF
DISCREDITING
THE
BIBLICAL
ARGUMENTS
AS
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANS
ARE
TO
FIND
BIBLICAL
ARGUMENTS
BUT
I
CANT
HELP
FEELING
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
BEING
USED
BY
BOTH
SIDES
AS
A
WAY
OF
JUSTIFYING
ATTITUDES
WHICH
COME
FROM
OTHER
SOURCES
THIS
IS
A
DANGEROUS
SITUATION
FOR
CHRISTIANS
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
ISSUE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
NOTE
SOME
PROBLEMS
I
HAVE
WITH
THE
PROHOMOSEXUAL
POSITION
AS
IT
IS
COMMONLY
PRESENTED
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
COMMON
ARGUMENTS
IS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
BIOLOGICALLY
DETERMINED
IE
GOD
MADE
ME
HOMOSEXUAL
AND
I
HAVE
NO
CHOICE
I
THINK
GOD
MADE
ME
HOMOSEXUAL
IS
A
FINE
VIEW
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
ALREADY
BELIEVE
ON
OTHER
GROUNDS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
ACCEPTABLE
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
IT
AS
AN
ARGUMENT
FOR
ACCEPTABILITY
MANY
PEOPLE
THINK
THAT
ALCHOLISM
IS
LARGELY
BIOLOGICAL
AND
DRUG
ADDICTION
MAY
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
AS
WELL
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
ITS
OK
MOST
OF
US
HAVE
PARTICULAR
THINGS
WE
TEND
TO
DO
WRONG
SOME
PEOPLE
GET
ANGRY
EASILY
OTHERS
TEND
TO
BE
ARROGANT
OTHERS
TEND
TO
BE
ATTRACED
TO
WOMEN
WHO
ARE
MARRIED
TO
SOMEONE
ELSE
HOMOSEXUALITY
IF
WE
VIEW
IT
AS
WRONG
WOULDNT
BE
DIFFERENT
THAN
ANY
OF
THESE
OTHER
THINGS
IF
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
FOLLOW
GOD
WE
ALL
END
UP
AT
ONE
TIME
OR
ANOTHER
HAVING
TO
WORK
TO
OVERCOME
BAD
HABITS
AND
PARTICULAR
TEMPTATIONS
THAT
CAUSE
US
PROBLEMS
NONE
OF
US
CAN
SIT
BACK
AND
SAY
THAT
BECAUSE
GOD
MADE
US
THE
WAY
WE
ARE
WE
CAN
JUST
RELAX
AS
JESUS
SAID
WE
ALL
HAVE
TO
TAKE
UP
OUR
CROSS
DAILY
THIS
CONCEPT
OF
DYING
TO
SELF
WHICH
ALSO
APPEARS
THROUGHOUT
PAULS
LETTERS
SEEMS
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
THERE
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
THINGS
ABOUT
OURSELVES
THAT
WE
WE
ARE
CALLED
ON
NOT
TO
ACCEPT
PAULS
LETTERS
AND
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
THROUGHOUT
HISTORY
SHOW
US
THAT
SIN
IS
INGRAINED
IN
US
AND
THE
BATTLE
AGAINST
IT
IS
LIFELONG
AND
DIFFICULT
THE
FACT
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
FIGHT
DOESNT
NECESSARILY
SAY
ITS
OK
MAYBE
THIS
ISNT
THE
PLACE
WHERE
WE
HAVE
TO
DIE
TO
SELF
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THOSE
WHO
THINK
IT
ISNT
ARE
FIGHTING
THE
BATTLE
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
AND
NOT
REJECTING
THE
CONCEPT
THAT
ALL
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
THE
DEEPLY
ENGRAINED
HABITS
OF
SIN
