ANY
ONE
WHO
THINKS
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
CHRISTIANITY
ARE
COMPATIBLE
SHOULD
CHECK
OUT
ROMANS
I
CORINTHIANS
I
TIMOTHY
JUDE
II
PETER
GEN
LEV
TO
NAME
A
FEW
OF
THE
VERSES
THAT
PERTAIN
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
WOULDNT
THAT
GO
FOR
ANY
SIN
MY
FATHER
TOLD
ME
WHEN
HE
WAS
GROWING
UP
CATHOLICS
WERE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
ASSOCIATE
WITH
ANYONE
WHO
WAS
DIVORCED
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
VERSES
PROHIBITTING
DIVORCE
SOMEHOW
DIVORCE
BECAME
ACCEPTABLE
EVEN
IN
CATHOLICISM
ANULLMENTS
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
NO
LONGER
A
SIN
TO
ASSOCIATE
WITH
A
DIVORCED
PERSON
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
EACH
PERSON
HAS
THEIR
OWN
TEMPTATIONS
TO
DEAL
WITH
PAUL
REPEATEDLY
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
THORN
IN
HIS
SIDE
SOME
THINK
IT
REFERS
TO
LUST
OTHERS
PRIDE
BUT
WHO
KNOWS
WHATEVER
THE
THORN
WAS
APPARENTLY
IT
WAS
NOT
COMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
YET
DOES
THAT
MAKE
HIS
EPISTLES
ANY
LESS
THE
BIBLE
WARNS
US
AGAINST
JUDGING
GREED
ANXIETY
IMPURE
THOUGHTS
BEARING
GRUDGES
ETC
ETC
I
SUPPOSE
WE
SHOULD
SEEK
OUT
ALL
THE
SOCALLED
CHRISTIANS
WHO
HAVE
ENTERTAINED
IMPURE
THOUGHTS
AND
OUST
THEM
ALL
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
GIVEN
IN
TO
GREED
GET
EM
OUTTA
HERE
JESUS
POINTED
OUT
THAT
HE
WAS
THE
PHYSICIAN
FOR
THE
SINNERS
ANY
ATTEMPTS
TO
MAKE
HOMOSEXUALS
FEEL
UNWELCOME
BECAUSE
OF
OUR
DISCOMFORT
WITH
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
IS
OUR
HATRED
SO
DEEP
THAT
RATHER
THAN
SEE
SOMEONE
TRY
TO
BECOME
CLOSER
TO
JESUS
WE
NEED
TO
KEEP
THEM
AWAY
DOES
JESUS
NEED
US
TO
SCREEN
OUT
THOSE
GUILTY
OF
A
PARTICULAR
SIN
DO
WE
REALLY
MISTRUST
JESUS
WHEN
HE
SAYS
HE
CAN
FORGIVE
ANY
SIN
THINK
ABOUT
IT
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
JESUS
ENCOUNTERED
WERE
SINNERS
AND
THE
PHARISEES
THE
SINNERS
HE
EMBRACED
AND
FORGAVE
THE
PHARISEES
HYPOCRITCAL
UNMERCIFUL
SELFRIGHTEOUS
POINTED
OUT
OTHERS
SINS
AND
DID
NOT
SEEK
AND
THUS
DID
NOT
GAIN
FORGIVENESS
OF
THEIR
OWN
SINS
WHAT
I
TAKE
FROM
THIS
AND
OTHER
VERSES
IS
THAT
IF
WE
DO
NOT
ADMIT
OUR
SINS
THOSE
SINS
WILL
NOT
BE
FORGIVEN
AND
SINCE
THOSE
GUILTY
OF
EVEN
ONE
SIN
ARE
GUILTY
OF
THE
WHOLE
LAW
THOSE
NOT
REPENTING
THE
JUDGING
OF
OTHERS
ARE
GUILTY
AS
GUILTY
AS
IF
THEY
COMMITTED
THE
SAME
SIN
THEY
JUDGED
OTHERS
OF
THE
POOR
IN
SPIRIT
MEEK
HUMBLE
MERCIFUL
PURE
OF
HEART
PEACEMAKERS
THOSE
WHO
THIRST
FOR
JUSTICE
THOSE
WHO
SUFFER
FOR
HIS
SAKE
ARE
BLESSED
