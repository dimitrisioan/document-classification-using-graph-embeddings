RE
MARYS
ASSUMPTION
MPAULUNLEDU
MARXHAUSEN
PAUL
WRITES
I
HATE
TO
SOUND
FLIPPANT
HAVING
SHOT
OFF
MY
MOUTH
BADLY
ON
THE
NET
BEFORE
BUT
IM
AFRAID
THAT
MUCH
OF
THIS
MATERIAL
ONLY
ADDS
TO
MY
FEELING
THAT
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
WOULD
BE
BETTER
PHRASED
OUR
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
MARY
IN
ALL
THE
TIME
IVE
BEEN
READING
ABOUT
MARY
ON
THIS
GROUP
I
CAN
NOT
RECALL
READING
MUCH
ABOUT
MARY
THAT
DID
NOT
SOUND
LIKE
WISHFUL
VENERATION
WITH
SCANT
IF
ANY
SCRIPTURAL
FOUNDATION
I
FIND
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
A
VERY
REAL
PORTRAIT
OF
CHRISTS
PARENTS
AS
COMPELLINGLY
HUMAN
PERSONS
TO
BE
HONORED
AND
ADMIRED
FOR
THEIR
HUMILITY
AND
SUBMISSION
TO
GODS
WORKING
BEYOND
DOUBT
BUT
THE
ALMALGA
MATION
OF
THEORIES
AND
DOGMA
THAT
HAS
ACCRETED
AROUND
THEM
GIVES
ME
AN
IMAGE
OF
ALIEN
AND
INHUMAN
CREATURES
UNTOUCHED
BY
SIN
OR
HUMAN
DESIRE
ONLY
CHRIST
HIMSELF
WAS
SO
TRULY
SANCTIFIED
AND
EVEN
HE
KNEW
TEMPTATION
ALBEIT
WITHOUT
SUBMITTING
TO
IT
I
ALSO
DONT
SEE
THE
NECESSITY
OF
SAYING
THE
HOLY
PARENTS
WERE
SOME
HOW
SANCTIFIED
BEYOND
NORMAL
HUMANITY
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
OUR
OWN
INABILITY
TO
GRASP
THE
IMMENSITY
OF
GODS
GRACE
IN
BEING
INCARNATED
THROUGH
AN
OR
DINARY
HUMAN
BEING
I
WONT
START
YELLING
ABOUT
HOW
PEOPLE
ARE
WORSHIPPING
MARY
ETC
SINCE
FOLKS
HAVE
TOLD
ME
OTHERWISE
ABOUT
THAT
BUT
I
DO
THINK
WE
LOSE
PART
OF
THE
WONDER
OF
GODS
INCARNATION
IN
CHRIST
WHEN
WE
MAKE
HIS
PARENTS
OUT
TO
BE
SINLESS
SEXLESS
DEATHLESS
OTHERWORLDLY
BEINGS
PAUL
MARXHAUSEN
PAUL
YOU
DID
A
WONDERFUL
JOB
OF
NOT
DOING
ANYTHING
HUMANY
POSSIBLE
TO
OFFEND
US
CATHOLICS
HOPEFULLY
I
CAN
BE
JUST
AS
CAREFUL
IN
MY
WORDING
AS
YOU
WERE
I
ALSO
DONT
WANT
TO
EXTEND
THIS
TOPIC
INTO
AN
ENTIRE
MAJOR
ISSUE
OF
DEBATE
ANYMORE
THAN
IT
ALREADY
IS
BUT
JUST
A
NOTE
OR
TWO
PLEASE
DONT
TALK
ABOUT
JESUS
PARENTSTHE
DOCTRINAL
POSITIONS
OF
THE
CHURCH
AN
UNEQUIVOCALLY
DIFFERENT
REGARDING
MARY
AND
JOSEPH
I
PERSONALLY
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
ANYTHING
BEING
ATTRIBUTED
TO
ST
JOSEPH
OTHER
THAN
HIS
SAINTHOOD
THAT
IS
NO
REFERENCE
EVER
TO
HIM
BEING
SINLESS
ASSUMED
INTO
HEAVEN
IMMACULATELY
CONCEIVED
ETCALL
THESE
IDEAS
APPLY
ONLY
TO
MARY
I
WOULD
AGREE
THERE
IS
VERY
LITTLE
SCRIPTURAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
OUR
DOCTRINES
ABOUT
MARY
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THAT
PRESENTS
A
SIGNIFICANT
PROBLEM
TO
THOSE
WHO
ACCEPT
THE
BIBLE
AS
THE
ONLY
SOURCE
OF
DOCTRINE
IF
HOWEVER
ONE
TURNS
TO
THE
SACRED
TRADITIONS
OF
THE
UNDIVIDED
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
THERE
IS
NO
PROBLEM
FINDING
PLENTLY
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
IT
WAS
BASICALLY
A
UNANIMOUS
BELIEF
AMONG
THE
APOSTLES
AND
ALL
THE
EARLY
GENERATION
THAT
MARY
WAS
ASSUMED
INTO
HEAVEN
BODY
AND
SOUL
ETC
ETC
IT
WASNT
UNTIL
THE
REFORMATION
THAT
THESE
DOCTRINES
WERE
CALLED
INTO
QUESTION
AS
FAR
AS
I
AM
CONCERNED
AGAIN
MY
PERSONALY
FEELINGS
IF
ITS
A
CHOICE
BETWEEN
THE
APOSTLES
OR
LUTHER
ILL
CHOOSE
THE
APOSTLES
EVERY
TIME
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
IS
RECORDED
WITHIN
THE
WRITINGS
THAT
THE
TRADITIONS
OF
MEN
HAVE
DETERMINED
TO
BE
THE
BIBLE
LIKE
A
SAID
JUST
A
COUPLE
OF
NOTES
AS
IS
OFTEN
SAID
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
MUST
AGREE
TO
POLITELY
DISAGREE
MAY
GODS
PEACE
AND
BLESSINGS
BE
WITH
YOU
ALWAYS
IN
YOUR
SEARCH
TO
DISCOVER
HIS
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
