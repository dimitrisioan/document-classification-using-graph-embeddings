jesus
only
and
oneness
tend
to
refer
to
groups
that
do
deny
the
trinity
they
explain
matthew
by
saying
that
jesus
is
the
name
of
the
father
jesus
is
the
name
of
the
son
and
jesus
is
the
name
of
the
name
of
the
holy
spirit
father
son
holy
spirit
referring
to
different
roles
all
filled
by
jesus
imho
this
are
going
from
bad
to
worse
was
bad
enough
i
do
not
like
a
god
who
prays
to
himself
i
refuse
to
believe
jesus
prayed
to
himself
lets
get
real
if
the
scriptures
say
he
prayed
to
the
father
then
the
father
is
someone
different
than
the
son
i
have
no
problems
with
multiple
gods
to
me
the
whole
context
of
the
scriptures
says
be
perfect
even
as
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
that
we
can
be
coheirs
with
christ
that
we
will
be
like
him
coheirs
share
all
things
equallyincluding
knowledge
power
dominion
etc
when
i
am
like
him
christ
i
will
be
the
same
as
he
isand
he
is
a
god
if
god
cannot
do
this
the
his
is
not
all
powerfuland
he
is
not
god
if
he
will
not
he
is
a
liarand
he
is
not
god
but
if
he
does
he
is
the
greatest
of
all
the
gods
i
dont
know
of
anyone
who
says
that
jesus
prayed
to
himself
the
whole
point
of
the
trinity
is
that
theres
enough
of
a
distinction
within
god
that
relationship
is
possible
this
implies
some
sort
of
communication
i
assume
that
in
their
native
form
the
father
and
son
are
directly
enough
connected
that
prayer
in
our
sense
isnt
involved
but
jesus
is
the
incarnation
of
the
son
ie
the
logos
made
flesh
when
hes
in
a
human
form
his
human
actions
are
limited
to
human
capabilities
so
communication
with
the
father
takes
the
form
of
prayer
i
dont
see
that
theres
anything
problematical
about
that
it
seems
to
be
implicit
in
the
whole
idea
of
incarnation
