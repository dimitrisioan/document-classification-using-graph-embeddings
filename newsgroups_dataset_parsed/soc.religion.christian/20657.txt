THERE
IS
A
WAY
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
NOT
BY
HUMAN
REASON
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
NOT
BY

AND
YET
IT
IS
BOTH
TO
PARAPHRASE
SARTRE
THE
PARTICULAR
IS
ABSURD
UNLESS
IT
HAS
AN
INFINITE
REFERENCE
POINT
IT
IS
ONLY
BECAUSE
OF
GODS
OWN
REVELATION
THAT
WE
CAN
BE
ABSOLUTE
ABOUT
A
THING
YOUR
LOGIC
COMES
TO
FRUITION

LUDWIG

OF

LUDWIGS
FAME
IS
OFTEN
EXPLAINED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
SPAWNED
NOT
ONE
BUT
TWO
SIGNIFICANT
MOVEMENTS
IN
CONTEMPORARY
PHILOSOPHY

REVOLVE
AROUND
TRACTATUS
LOGICOPHILOSPHICUS
AND
PHILOSOPHICAL
INVESTIGATION
MANY
OF
WITTS
COMMENTS
AND
IMPLICIT
CONCLUSIONS
SUGGEST
WAYS
OF
GOING
BEYOND
THE
EXPLICIT
CRITIQUE
OF
LANGUAGE
HE
OFFERS
ACCORDING
TO
SOME
OF
THE
IMPLICIT
SUGGESTIONS
OF
WITTS
THOUGHT
ORDINARY
LANGUAGE
IS
AN
INVALUABLE
RESOURCE
OFFERING
A
NECESSARY
FRAMEWORK
FOR
THE
CONDUCT
OF
DAILY
LIFE
HOWEVER
THOUGH
ITS
FORMAL
FEATURES
REMAIN
THE
SAME
ITS
CONTENT
DOES
NOT
AND
IT
IS
ALWAYS
CAPABLE
OF
BEING
TRANSCENDED
AS
OUR
EXPERIENCE
CHANGES
AND
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
IS
DEEPENED
GIVING
US
A
CLEARER
PICTURE
OF
WHAT
WE
ARE
AND
WHAT
WE
WISH
TO
SAY
ON
WITTS
OWN
ACCOUNT
THERE
IS
A
DYNAMIC
FLUIDITY
OF
LANGUAGE
IT
IS
FOR
THIS
REASON
THAT
ANY
CRITIQUE
OF
LANGUAGE
MUST
MOVE
FROM
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
LIMITS
OF
LANGUAGE
TO
TALKING
ABOUT
ITS
BOUNDARIES
WHERE
A
BOUNDARY
IS
UNDERSTOOD
NOT
AS
A
WALL
BUT
A
THRESHOLD
VONWRIGHTSS
COMMENT
THAT
WITTS
SENTENCES
HAVE
A
CONTENT
THAT
OFTEN
LIES
DEEP
BENEATH
THE
SURFACE
OF
LANGUAGE
ON
THE
SURFACE
WITT
TALKS
OF
THE
INSUPERABLE
POSITION
OF
ORDINARY
LANGUAGE
AND
THE
NECESSITY
OF
BRINGING
OURSELVES
TO
ACCEPT
IT
WITHOUT
QUESTION
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
WE
ARE
FACED
WITH
WITTS
OWN
CREATIVE
USES
OF
LANGUAGE
AND
HIS
CONCERN
FOR
BRINGING
ABOUT
CHANGES
IN
OUR
TRADITIONAL
MODES
OF
UNDERSTANDING
PHILOSOPHY
THEN
THROUGH
MORE
PERSPICACIOUS
SPEECH
SEEKS
TO
EFFECT
THIS
UNITY
RATHER
THAN
ASSUMING
THAT
IT
IS
ALREADY
FUNCTIONING
YES
THE
MOST
BRILLIANT
OF
SCIENTISTS
ARE
UNABLE
TO
OFFER
A
FOUNDATION
FOR
HUMAN
SPEECH
SO
LONG
AS
THEY
REJECT
CHRISTIANITY
IN
HIS
TRACTATUS
WE
HAVE
THE
WELL
NIGH
PERFECT
EXHIBITION
OF
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
IMPASSE
OF
THE
SCIENTIFIC
IDEAL
OF
EXHAUSTIVE
LOGICAL
ANALYSIS
OF
REALITY
BY
MAN
PERFECT
LANGUAGE
DOES
NOT
EXIST
FOR
FALLEN
MAN
THEREFORE
WE
MUST
GET
ON
ABOUT
OUR
BUISNESS
OF
RELATING
TRUTH
VIA
ORDINARY
LANGUAGE
THIS
IS
WHY
JOHNS
GOSPEL
IS
SO
DEAR
TO
MOST
CHRISTIANS
IT
IS
SO
SIMPLE
IN
IT
CONVEYANCE
OF
THE
REVEALATION
OF
GOD
YET
SO
FULL
OF
UNLIEING
DEPTH
OF
UNDERSTANDING
HE
VIEWED
CHRIST
FROM
THE
OT
CONCEPT
OF
AS
A
MAN
THINKETH
SO
HE
IS
JOHN
LOOKED
AT
THE
OUTWARD
AS
ONLY
AN
INDICATOR
OF
WHAT
WAS
INSIDE
THAT
IS
THE
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
CHRIST
AND
SO
MUST
WE
WORDS
ARE
ONLY
VEHICALS
OF
TRUTH
HE
IS
TRUTH
THE
SCRIPTURES
ARE
PLAIN
IN
THEIR
EXPOUNDING
THAT
THERE
IS
A
TRUTH
AND
THAT
IT
IS
KNOWABLE
THERE
ARE
ABSOLUTES
AND
THEY
TOO
ARE
KNOWABLE
HOWEVER
THEY
ARE
ONLY
KNOWABLE
WHEN
HE
REVEALS
THEM
TO
THE
INDIVIDUAL
THERE
IS
AND
WE
SHOULDNT
SHY
FROM
THIS
A
MYSTICISM
TO
CHRISTIANITY
PAUL
IN
ROM
SAYS
THERE
ARE
MEN
IN
THE
WORLD
THERE
IS
THE
ONE
WHO
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
SPIRIT
AND
THEREFORE
CAN
NOT
KNOW
THE
THINGS
OF
THE
SPIRIT
THE
SPIRIT
OF
TRUTH
AND
THERE
IS
THE
ONE
WHO
HAS
THE
SPIRIT
AND
HAS
THE
CAPACITY
TO
KNOW
OF
THE
TRUTH
BUT
THERE
IS
THE
THIRD
THE
ONE
WHO
NOT
ONLY
HAS
THE
SPIRIT
BUT
THAT
THE
SPIRIT
HAS
HIM
WHO
CAN
KNOW
THE
DEEP
THINGS
OF
GOD
AND
REVEAL
THEM
TO
US
OTHER
THAN
THE
SPIRIT
AND
IT
IS
ONLY
THE
DEEP
THINGS
OF
GOD
THAT
ARE
ABSOLUTE
AND
TRUE
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
THING
AS
TRUE
TRUTH
AND
IT
IS
REAL
IT
CAN
BE
EXPERIENCED
AND
IT
IS
VERIFIABLE
I
DISAGREE
WITH
DR
NANCYS
SWEETIES
CONCLUSION
BECAUSE
IF
IT
IS
TAKEN
TO
FRUITION
IT
LEADS
TO
RELATIVISM
WHICH
LEADS
TO
DISPAIR
I
WOULD
KNOW
THE
WORDS
WHICH
HE
WOULD
ANSWER
ME
AND
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
HE
WOULD
SAY

ME
