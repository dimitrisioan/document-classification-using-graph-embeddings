re
prodigal
son
the
parable
of
the
prodigal
son
is
not
about
who
is
and
who
isnt
an
immoral
person
it
is
about
grace
and
the
love
of
god
most
people
would
agree
with
that
concerning
the
younger
son
the
elder
son
is
simply
a
negative
example
of
the
some
thing
he
thinks
that
he
must
earn
his
fathers
love
that
he
has
earned
it
that
he
is
entitled
to
it
his
father
tells
him
that
he
is
on
the
wrong
track
he
has
always
been
lovedfor
the
same
reason
his
brother
has
always
been
he
is
his
fathers
son
we
are
too
performance
oriented
to
consistently
get
the
point
we
are
willing
to
be
saved
by
grace
but
once
we
are
christians
we
want
to
go
back
to
earning
and
deserving
are
you
so
foolish
after
beginning
with
the
spirit
are
you
now
trying
to
attain
your
goal
by
human
effort
