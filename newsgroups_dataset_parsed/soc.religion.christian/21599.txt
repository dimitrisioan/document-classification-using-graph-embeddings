RE
SERBIAN
GENOCIDE
WORK
OF
GOD
VERA
SHANTI
NOYES
WRITES
REALLY
YOU
MAY
BE
RIGHT
BUT
ID
LIKE
PROOF
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
AND
WE
HOWEVER
SHALL
BE
INNOCENT
OF
THIS
SIN
AND
WILL
PRAY
WITH
EARNEST
ENTREATY
AND
SUPPLICATION
THAT
THE
CREATOR
OF
ALL
MAY
KEEP
UNHARMED
THE
NUMBERS
OF
HIS
ELECT
ST
CLEMENT
BISHOP
OF
ROME
LETTER
TO
THE
CORINTHIANS
C
AD
IGNATIUS
ALSO
CALLED
THEOPHORUS
TO
THE
CHURCH
AT
EPHESUS
IN
ASIA
WHICH
IS
WORTHY
OF
ALL
FELICITATION
BLESSED
AS
IT
IS
WITH
GREATNESS
BY
THE
FULLNESS
OF
GOD
THE
FATHER
PREDESTINED
FROM
ALL
ETERNITY
FOR
A
GLORY
THAT
IS
LASTING
AND
UNCHANGING
UNITED
AND
CHOSEN
IN
TRUE
SUFFERING
BY
THE
WILL
OF
THE
FATHER
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
OUR
GOD
ST
IGNATIUS
BISHOP
OF
ANTIOCH
LETTER
TO
THE
EPHESIANS
ADDRESS
C
AD
WE
SAY
THEREFORE
THAT
IN
SUBSTANCE
IN
CONCEPT
IN
ORGIN
AND
IN
EMINECE
THE
ANCIENT
AND
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
IS
ALONE
GATHERING
AS
IT
DOES
INTO
THE
UNITY
OF
THE
ONE
FAITH
WHICH
RESULTS
FROM
THE
FAMILIAR
COVENANTS
THOSE
ALREADY
CHOSEN
THOSE
PREDESTINED
BY
GOD
WHO
KNEW
BEFORE
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
WORLD
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BE
JUST
ST
CLEMENT
PATRIARCH
AND
ARCHBISHOP
OF
ALEXANDRIA
MISCELLANIES
C
AD
OF
COURSE
THE
DOCTRINE
WAS
EXPLAINED
MORE
FULLY
LATER
ON
BY
STS
AUGUSTINE
AQUINAS
ETC
BUT
THE
SEEDS
WERE
THER
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
THIS
IS
REALLY
CONFUSING
TO
ME
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
I
STILL
BELIEVE
THAT
CHRIST
JESUS
DIED
FOR
ALL
OF
US
PREKNOWLEDGE
OF
OBSTINACY
SEEMS
LIKE
AN
AWFULLY
CONVOLUTED
WAY
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
VERSES
BUT
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
READING
IT
WRONG
I
SAY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
NOT
SAVED
ARE
NOT
SAVED
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THEIR
OWN
SINS
IT
IS
NOT
BECAUSE
GOD
DID
NOT
GIVE
THEM
SUFFICIENT
GRACE
FOR
HE
DOES
DO
SO
IN
HIS
DESIRE
THAT
ALL
MEN
MIGHT
BE
SAVED
HOWEVER
AS
ONLY
SOME
ARE
SAVED
AND
THOSE
WHO
ARE
SAVED
ARE
SAVED
BY
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
NOT
BY
WORKS
LEST
ANY
MAN
SHOULD
BOAST
THE
OTHERS
ARE
DAMNED
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
OBSTINACY
IN
REFUSING
TO
HEED
THE
CALL
OF
GOD
THEY
ARE
DAMNED
BY
THEIR
OWN
FREE
WILL
AND
CHOSING
A
CHOICE
FORSEEN
BY
GOD
IN
HIS
CAUSING
THEM
TO
BE
NOT
PREDESTINED
BUT
REPROBATED
INSTEAD
SO
GOD
USES
GRACE
LIKE
MARGARINE
HE
ONLY
SPREADS
IT
WHERE
ITS
NEEDED
AND
NOT
WHERE
IT
ISNT
AND
SO
THERE
ARE
THE
SAVED
AND
THE
NOTSAVED
AND
NOTHING
IN
BETWEEN
HMMMM
CERTAINLY
GOD
DOES
NOT
DISTRIBUTE
GRACE
EVENLY
IF
HE
DID
NO
ONE
COULD
HAVE
THEIR
HEART
HARDENED
OR
RATHER
HARDEN
THEIR
HEART
THUS
CAUSING
GOD
TO
WITHDRAW
HIS
GRACE
BUT
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
THE
WORLD
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
THOSE
WHO
GOD
KNOWS
TO
BE
SAVED
AND
THOSE
GOD
KNOWS
TO
BE
ON
THE
ROAD
TO
PERDITION
THE
KEY
IS
THAT
GOD
KNOWS
IT
AND
WE
DO
NOT
THUS
NO
ONE
CAN
BOAST
IN
COMPLETE
ASSURANCE
THAT
THEY
ARE
ONE
OF
THE
ELECT
AND
PREDESTINED
BUT
NO
ONE
WHO
IS
A
CHRISTIAN
IN
GOOD
STANDIN
SHOULD
DOUBT
THEIR
SALVATION
EITHER
THAT
SHOWS
A
LACK
OF
TRUST
IN
GOD
BE
PUNISHED
AFTER
WE
DIE
YOURE
SAYING
WHAT
WE
GET
AFTER
WE
DIE
HAS
A
DIRECT
BEARING
ON
HOW
WE
LIVE
NOW
STRANGE
YOU
MUST
ADMIT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
ANYWAY
WHY
WOULD
YOU
WANT
SOMETHING
IN
THE
HEAR
AND
KNOW
WHEN
YOU
CAN
RECIEVE
FOLD
IN
HEAVEN
BETTER
TO
LAY
UP
YOUR
TREASURE
IN
HEAVEN
IS
WHAT
JESUS
SAID
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
CONDEMN
THE
RICH
BUT
SIMPLY
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ARE
RICH
ARE
FREQUENTLY
VERY
EVIL
OR
IMMORAL
SO
GOD
MUST
GIVE
THEM
THEIR
BLESSING
KNOW
AS
THEY
HAVE
CHOSEN
REMEBER
JESUS
PROMISED
TRIBULATION
IN
THIS
WORLD
AND
HATRED
OF
OTHERS
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
CHRISTIANS
HE
DID
NOT
PROMISE
HEAVEN
ON
EARTH
HE
PROMISED
HEAVEN
SO
SIN
IS
EITHER
PUNISHED
NOW
OR
LATER
AND
NOT
BOTH
WHAT
IF
ITS
SORT
OF
HALFPUNISHED
ARE
THERE
ANY
GREY
AREAS
IN
THIS
DOCTRINE
NOT
REALLY
UNLESS
YOU
DO
PENANCE
HERE
ON
EARTH
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
DO
IT
IN
PURGATORY
AS
PAUL
POINTED
OUT
CORINTHIANS
THOSE
WITH
POORER
WORKS
THOUGH
STILL
DONE
WITH
GOOD
INTENTIONS
WILL
ONLY
BE
SAVED
THROUGH
FIRE
THE
DAMNED
WILL
OF
COURSE
GO
INTO
FIRE
IMMEADIATELY
FOR
WHATEVER
GOOD
THEY
DID
WAS
NOT
FOR
GOD
BUT
FOR
SELF
DEAD
WORKS
OF
COURSE
THE
CHURCH
GIVES
INDULGENCES
HAS
CONFESSION
AND
ANNOINTING
OF
THE
SICK
TO
REMOVE
SIN
AND
THE
THE
VESTIGES
OF
SIN
SO
THERE
IS
REALLY
LITTLE
EXCUSE
FOR
ENDING
UP
IN
PURGATORY
IT
IS
A
LAST
HOPE
FOR
THE
SOMEWHAT
LAZY
AND
CARELESS
AS
I
SAID
ABOVE
IN
REFERRING
TO
PAUL
AND
NO
COMMENTS
WERE
TAKEN
AS
FLAMES
YOU
ARE
ONE
OF
THE
MORE
POLITE
PEOPLE
I
HAVE
TALKED
TO
OVER
THE
NET
ANDY
BYLER
PS
AS
FOR
BALKAN
MILITARY
ADVENTURES
THE
OLD
SAW
ABOUT
THAT
AREA
IS
THAT
IT
PRODUCES
MORE
HISTORY
THEN
CAN
BE
CONSUMED
LOCALLY
ALEXANDER
THE
GREAT
WWI
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
THE
BYZANTINE
EMPIRE
BY
WHICH
I
REFER
TO
STIRFE
AND
FOREIGN
ADVENTURES
OF
THEM
IN
GENERAL
THE
BALKANS
WARS
OF
THE
LATINGREEK
WARS
OF
THE
ETC
NOT
A
GOOD
PLACE
TO
HOP
INTO
