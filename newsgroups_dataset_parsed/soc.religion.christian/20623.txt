RE
A
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
BEE
BOTHERING
ME
IN
ARTICLE
ATTERLEPVELAACSOAKLANDEDU
CARDINAL
XIMENEZ
WRITES
RELIGIOUS
PEOPLE
ARE
THREATENED
BY
SCIENCE
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
BEEN
SYSTEMATICALLY
REMOVING
THE
PHYSICAL
PROOFS
OF
GODS
EXISTENCE
AS
TIME
GOES
ON
WE
HAVE
TO
RELY
MORE
AND
MORE
ON
FAITH
AND
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
TO
RELATE
TO
GOD
BECUASE
SCIENCE
IS
REMOVING
OUR
PROPS
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
A
BAD
THING
FIRST
OF
ALL
I
RESENT
YOUR
ASSUMPTION
THAT
YOU
KNOW
WHY
I
AM
THREATENED
BY
SCIENCE
OR
EVEN
THAT
I
AM
THREATENED
AT
ALL
ALTHOUGH
I
ADMIT
THE
LATTER
THE
REASON
I
AM
THREATENED
BY
SCIENCE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
MY
NEED
FOR
PROOF
OF
MY
LORDS
EXISTENCE
GOD
REVEALS
HIMSELF
IN
MANY
WAYS
INCLUDING
TO
SOME
DEGREE
SCIENCE
MY
PROBLEM
WITH
SCIENCE
IS
THAT
OFTEN
IT
ALLOWS
US
TO
ASSUME
WE
KNOW
WHAT
IS
BEST
FOR
OURSELVES
GOD
ENDOWED
US
WITH
THE
ABILITY
TO
PRODUCE
LIFE
THROUGH
SEXUAL
RELATIONS
FOR
EXAMPLE
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
MAKE
THAT
AVAILIBLE
TO
EVERYONE
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
IF
SCIENCE
CAN
OVERRIDE
GODS
DECISION
THROUGH
ALTERATIONS
THAT
GOD
WILLS
FOR
US
TO
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
DECIDE
WHO
SHOULD
AND
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
CHILDREN
SHOULD
MEN
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
BABIES
IF
THAT
IS
MADE
POSSIBLE
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALWAYS
HAD
THE
ABILITY
TO
END
LIVES
UNNATURALLY
AND
SOON
MAY
HAVE
THE
ABILITY
TO
BRING
LIVES
INTO
THE
WORLD
UNNATURALLY
THE
CLOSEST
THING
TO
ARTIFICIALLY
CREATED
LIFE
IS
ARTIFICIALLY
CREATED
DEATH
AND
AS
GOD
HAS
RESERVED
JUDGEMENT
ABOUT
WHEN
PEOPLE
SHOULD
DIE
TO
HIMSELF
I
BELIEVE
WE
SHOULD
RELY
ON
GODS
WISDOM
ABOUT
HOW
PEOPLE
SHOULD
BE
BROUGHT
IN
TO
THE
WORLD
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
I
REJECT
ALL
FORMS
OF
MEDICAL
TREATMENT
HOWEVER
TREATMENT
THAT
ALLEVIATES
PAIN
OR
PREVENTS
PAIN
FROM
OCCURING
IS
PERFECTLY
ACCEPTABLE
I
BELIEVE
AS
IT
WAS
ACCEPTABLE
FOR
JESUS
TO
CURE
THE
SICK
HOWEVER
TREATMENT
THAT
MERELY
PROLONGS
LIFE
FOR
NO
REASON
OR
MAKES
UNNECESSARY
ALTERATIONS
TO
THE
BODY
FOR
MERE
AESTHETIC
PURPOSES
GO
TOO
FAR
ARE
WE
NOT
HAPPY
WITH
THE
BEAUTY
GOD
GAVE
US
I
CANNOT
DRAW
A
SOLID
LINE
REGARDING
WHERE
I
WOULD
APPROVE
OF
SCIENTIFIC
STUDY
AND
WHERE
I
WOULD
NOT
BUT
I
WILL
SAY
THIS
BEFORE
ONE
EXPERIMENTS
WITH
THE
UNIVERSE
TO
FIND
OUT
ALL
ITS
SECRETS
ONE
SHOULD
ASK
WHY
THEY
WANT
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
BEFORE
ONE
ALTERS
THE
BODY
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
GIVEN
THEY
SHOULD
ASK
THEMSELES
WHY
THEIR
BODY
IS
NOT
SATISFACTORY
TOO
THEM
AS
IT
IS
I
CANNOT
MAKE
ANY
GENERAL
RULES
THAT
WILL
COVER
ALL
THE
CASES
BUT
I
WILL
SAY
THAT
EACH
PERSON
SHOULD
PRAY
FOR
GUIDANCE
WHEN
TRYING
TO
UNRAVEL
THE
MYSTERIES
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
AND
SHOULD
CEASE
THEIR
UNRAVELLING
IF
THEY
HAVE
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THEIR
SEARCH
IS
DISPLEASING
TO
GOD
MALCUSCO
