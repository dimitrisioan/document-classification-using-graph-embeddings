RE
IF
THERE
WERE
NO
HELL
IN
WRITES
HERES
A
QUESTION
THAT
SOME
FRIENDS
AND
I
WERE
DEBATING
LAST
NIGHT
Q
IF
YOU
KNEW
BEYOND
ALL
DOUBT
THAT
HELL
DID
NOT
EXIST
AND
THAT
UNBELIEVERS
SIMPLY
REMAINED
DEAD
WOULD
YOU
REMAIN
A
CHRISTIAN
REASONING
PERTINENT
TO
BELIEVING
XIANS
DELETED
FOR
SPACE
IT
STRIKES
ME
FOR
NO
APPARENT
REASON
THAT
THIS
IS
REVERSIBLE
IE
IF
I
HAD
PROOF
THAT
THERE
EXISTED
A
HELL
IN
WHICH
I
WOULD
BE
ETERNALLY
PUNISHED
FOR
NOT
BELIEVING
IN
LIFE
WOULD
THAT
MAKE
ME
A
XIAN
PARDON
MY
LANGUAGE
BLOODYHELLNO
OF
COURSE
BEING
MERELY
A
REVERSAL
OF
YOUR
THINKING
THIS
DOESNT
ADD
ANYTHING
NEW
TO
THE
DEBATE
BUT
SEVERAL
FRIENDS
DISAGREED
ARGUING
THE
FEAR
OF
HELL
WAS
NECESSARY
TO
MOTIVATE
PEOPLE
TO
CHRISTIANITY
TO
ME
THAT
FATALLY
UNDERCUTS
THE
MESSAGE
THAT
GOD
IS
LOVE
A
POINT
VERY
WELL
TAKEN
IMNSHO
SUCCESSFUL
TERRORISM
IS
CALLED
REVOLUTION
AND
IS
ADMIRED
BY
HISTORY
UNSUCCESSFUL
TERRORISM
IS
JUST
LOWLY
COWARDLY
TERRORISM
PHIL
TRODWELL
ON
ALTATHEISM
