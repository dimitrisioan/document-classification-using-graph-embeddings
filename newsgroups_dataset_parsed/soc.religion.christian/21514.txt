DEFINITION
OF
CHRISTIANITY
I
HAVE
ENROLLED
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AT
A
COLLEGE
HERE
IN
ST
LOUIS
THE
TEACHER
OF
THE
CLASS
IS
WHAT
I
CONSIDER
TO
BE
CLOSEDMINDED
AND
BIGOTTED
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
WHAT
THE
DEFINITION
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IS
HIS
DEFINITION
IS
TIED
DIRECTLY
TO
THAT
OF
THE
TRINITY
AND
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCHS
DEFINITION
OF
IT
AND
BELIEF
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
TO
CALL
ONES
SELF
A
CHRISTIAN
WHILE
HIS
SAYING
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
IT
SO
I
NEVERTHELESS
FEEL
INSULTED
OR
AM
I
JUST
NEUROTIC
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
RESPOND
TO
HIM
WITH
SOME
SENSE
OF
LITERACY
WHILE
MAINTAINING
AN
AMIABLE
STUDENTTEACHER
RELATIONSHIP
SO
IS
THERE
COMMON
DEFINITION
OF
WHAT
CHRISTIANITY
IS
AS
THE
PREVIOUS
DISCUSSION
OF
THE
TRINITY
DID
NOT
LEND
ITSELF
TO
AN
EXCHANGE
OF
FLAMES
I
AM
HOPEFUL
THAT
THIS
WILL
ALSO
NOT
PRODUCE
MAJOR
FLAMES
REGARDS
LARRY
AUTRY
SILICON
GRAPHICS
ST
LOUIS
AUTRYSGICOM
OFTEN
WE
GET
INTO
DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT
WHO
IS
CHRISTIAN
UNFORTUNATELY
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
POSSIBLE
DEFINITIONS
STARTING
FROM
THE
BROADEST
COMMONLY
USED
DEFINITIONS
ARE
A
HISTORICAL
DEFINITION
PEOPLE
WHO
ACCEPT
CHRIST
AS
LORD
AND
SAVIOR
A
BROAD
DOCTRINAL
DEFINITION
NARROW
DOCTRINAL
DEFINITIONS
BY
A
HISTORICAL
DEFINITION
I
MEAN
THE
SORT
OF
DEFINITION
A
SECULAR
HISTORIAN
WOULD
LIKELY
USE
THIS
WOULD
INCLUDE
ANY
GROUP
THAT
DEVELOPED
OUT
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
CHURCH
AND
CONTINUES
WITHIN
THE
SAME
BROAD
CULTURE
EG
SOME
UNITARIANS
WOULD
FAIL
JUST
ABOUT
ANY
DOCTRINAL
TEST
YOU
COULD
COME
UP
WITH
YET
ITS
CLEAR
THAT
THAT
GROUP
DEVELOPED
FROM
CHRISTIANITY
AND
PEOPLE
FROM
VERY
DIFFERENT
BACKGROUNDS
EG
HINDUS
WOULD
LIKELY
SEE
THEM
AS
PART
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THIS
IS
NOT
A
DEFINITION
MOST
CHRISTIANS
LIKE
BUT
ITS
RELEVANT
IN
SOME
POLITICAL
AND
ETHNIC
CONTEXTS
ACCEPTING
CHRIST
AS
LORD
AND
SAVIOR
IS
A
TEST
USED
BY
MANY
CHRISTIAN
GROUPS
FOR
MEMBERSHIP
EG
THE
SOUTHERN
BAPTISTS
AND
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH
USA
I
WOULD
QUALIFY
IT
BY
SAYING
THAT
WHAT
MOST
PEOPLE
HAVE
IN
MIND
IS
AN
EXCLUSIVE
COMMITMENT
TO
CHRIST
SO
THAT
SOMEONE
WHO
ACCEPTED
CHRIST
AS
ONE
OF
MANY
GODS
WOULD
NOT
FIT
ITS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
FORMULATE
A
CRITERION
THAT
IS
RELIGIOUS
BUT
IS
NOT
BASED
ON
TECHNICAL
DOCTRINE
BY
THIS
DEFINITION
GROUPS
SUCH
AS
ARIANS
WOULD
BE
VIEWED
AS
HERETICAL
CHRISTIANS
BUT
STILL
CHRISTIANS
IN
THE
MODERN
CONTEXT
THIS
WOULD
INCLUDE
MORMONS
JWS
AND
ONENESS
PENTECOSTALS
THEY
WOULD
BE
VIEWED
AS
HERETICAL
CHRISTIANS
BUT
STILL
CHRISTIAN
IN
PRACTICE
I
BELIEVE
JUST
ABOUT
EVERYONE
WHO
FALLS
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
WOULD
ACCEPT
THE
APOSTLES
CREED
THE
NEXT
LEVEL
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
GIVE
A
BROAD
DOCTRINAL
DEFINITION
WHICH
INCLUDES
ALL
OF
THE
MAJOR
STRANDS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
BUT
EXCLUDES
GROUPS
THAT
ARE
FELT
TO
BE
OUTSIDE
HISTORIC
CHRISTIANITY
THIS
IS
OF
COURSE
A
SLIPPERY
ENTERPRISE
SINCE
CATHOLICS
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
PROTESTANTS
ARE
OUTSIDE
HISTORIC
CHRISTIANITY
ETC
BUT
I
THINK
THE
MOST
COMMONLY
ACCEPTED
DEFINITION
WOULD
BE
BASED
ON
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
NICENE
CREED
AND
THE
FORMULA
OF
CHALCEDON
THE
ATTEMPT
IS
TO
CHARACTERIZE
DOCTRINES
THAT
ALL
MAJOR
STRANDS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AGREE
ARE
KEY
OBVIOUSLY
THIS
IS
TO
SOME
EXTENT
A
MATTER
OF
JUDGEMENT
A
MORMON
WILL
REGARD
THE
LDS
CHURCH
AS
A
MAJOR
STRAND
AND
THUS
WILL
NOT
WANT
TO
INCLUDE
ANYTHING
THAT
CONTRADICTS
THEIR
BELIEFS
BUT
I
THINK
THIS
DEFINITION
WOULD
HAVE
FAIRLY
BROAD
ACCEPTANCE
FINALLY
SOME
PEOPLE
USE
DEFINITIONS
THAT
I
WOULD
SAY
ARE
LIMITED
TO
A
SPECIFIC
CHRISTIAN
TRADITION
EG
SOME
EVANGELICALS
ONLY
CONSIDER
SOMEONE
CHRISTIAN
IF
HE
HAS
HAD
AN
EVANGELICALSTYLE
CONVERSION
EXPERIENCE
AND
SOME
IVE
EVEN
HEARD
OF
GROUPS
THAT
LIMIT
IT
TO
THEIR
SPECIFIC
CHURCH
I
THINK
YOU
CAN
FIND
CONTEXTS
WHERE
EACH
OF
THESE
DEFINITIONS
IS
USED
A
LOT
IS
GOING
TO
DEPEND
UPON
THE
PURPOSE
YOURE
USING
IT
FOR
IF
YOURE
USING
IT
DESCRIPTIVELY
EG
IN
HISTORY
OR
ANTHROPOLOGY
YOULL
PROBABLY
USE
DEFINITION
OR
IF
YOURE
USING
IT
NORMATIVELY
IE
TO
SAY
WHAT
YOU
BELIEVE
THE
CHRISTIAN
MESSAGE
IS
YOULL
PROBABLY
USE
A
DEFINITION
LIKE
OR
EVEN
CLH
