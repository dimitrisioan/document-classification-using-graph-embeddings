i
dont
have
a
problem
with
being
condemned
to
hell
either
the
way
i
see
it
if
god
wants
to
punish
me
for
being
honest
in
my
skepticism
that
is
for
saying
he
doesnt
exist
he
certainly
wouldnt
be
changing
his
nature
besides
i
would
rather
spend
an
eternity
in
hell
than
be
beside
god
in
heaven
knowing
even
one
man
would
spend
his
eternal
life
being
scorched
for
his
wrongdoings
i
see
some
irony
here
jesus
was
willing
to
go
through
torture
to
free
you
from
the
definite
promise
of
hell
based
on
adameves
fall
from
grace
but
rather
than
allow
him
to
stand
in
your
place
you
would
give
up
your
redemption
to
stand
with
those
who
do
not
accept
his
grace
god
would
rather
have
none
in
hell
which
seems
to
put
the
burden
of
choice
on
us
of
course
this
is
all
fictional
anyway
since
you
reject
him
also
my
former
sociology
professor
once
told
us
at
the
beginning
of
our
term
you
all
start
out
with
an
awhat
you
do
with
that
during
the
course
of
this
term
is
up
to
you
in
the
beginningadam
and
eve
were
given
