RE
HOMOSEXUALITY
ISSUES
IN
CHRISTIANITY
ANY
ATTEMPTS
TO
MAKE
HOMOSEXUALS
FEEL
UNWELCOME
BECAUSE
OF
OUR
DISCOMFORT
WITH
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
IS
OUR
HATRED
SO
DEEP
THAT
RATHER
THAN
SEE
SOMEONE
TRY
TO
BECOME
CLOSER
TO
JESUS
WE
NEED
TO
KEEP
THEM
AWAY
THIS
IS
TOO
OFTEN
TRUE
MANY
PEOPLE
TRY
TO
PLACE
THIS
AS
A
HIGHER
SIN
HOWEVER
DOES
JESUS
NEED
US
TO
SCREEN
OUT
THOSE
GUILTY
OF
A
PARTICULAR
SIN
DO
WE
REALLY
MISTRUST
JESUS
WHEN
HE
SAYS
HE
CAN
FORGIVE
ANY
SIN
A
BIG
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
MANY
OF
THE
HOMOSEXUALS
AND
PEOPLE
ADVOCATING
ACCEPTANCE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
IN
CHURCHES
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
ACTIVE
HOMOSEXUALITY
A
SIN
I
DONT
OFTEN
SEE
THE
ATTITUDE
OF
FORGIVE
ME
AND
I
WILL
TRY
TO
CHANGE
INSTEAD
I
SEE
THERES
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
MY
LIFE
AND
I
CAN
BE
A
GOOD
CHRISTIAN
SO
IT
MUST
BE
YOU
WHO
HAVE
AN
ILLNESS
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
ACCEPT
ME
CHRISTIANS
CAN
AND
WILL
ACCEPT
HOMOSEXUALS
JUST
AS
THEY
WILL
ACCEPT
ANY
SINNER
SURE
IT
MAY
BE
NATURAL
TO
SOME
PEOPLE
TO
BE
HOMOSEXUAL
BUT
IT
IS
ALSO
PERFECTLY
NATURAL
FOR
EVERYONE
TO
SIN
I
WAS
BORN
WITH
A
DESIRE
TO
SIN
BUT
I
WORK
TO
PREVENT
MYSELF
FROM
SINNING
ITS
MUCH
LESS
COMMON
NOW
BUT
I
STILL
HAVE
URGES
TO
LASH
OUT
IN
ANGER
THERE
ALSO
MAY
NOT
BE
A
SUDDEN
DISAPPEARANCE
OF
SINFUL
DESIRES
OR
EVER
SO
IT
IS
SAD
TO
SEE
PEOPLE
LEAVE
THE
CHURCH
WHEN
THEY
ARE
DISCOURAGED
THAT
THEY
ARE
STILL
HOMOSEXUAL
AFTER
SEVERAL
YEARS
