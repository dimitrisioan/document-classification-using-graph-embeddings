WRITES
THE
ONLY
REASON
FOR
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
IS
REVENGE
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
TRY
TO
REFUTE
A
POSITION
TRY
TO
REFUTE
THE
WHOLE
POSITION
OR
ACKNOSLEDGE
THAT
YOU
ARE
ONLY
SPEAKING
TO
SMALL
PIECE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
BROAD
SWEEPING
THE
ONLY
REASON
ETC
ON
AS
TOUGH
NUT
TO
CRACK
AS
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
REALLLY
DOESNT
HELP
MUCH
EVERY
YEAR
THE
FBI
RELEASES
CRIME
STATS
SHOWING
AN
OVERWHELMING
AMOUNT
OF

IS
COMMITTED
BY

PENALTY
NOT
FOR

YOUR
POINT
IS
WELL
TAKEN

ACKNOWLEDGE
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
WHO

SORRY
ABOUT
THAT
OF

I
STILL
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
THOSE
WHO
FAVOR
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
DO
SO
FOR
REASON
OF
SEEKING
VENGEANCE
IM
CURIOUS
IF
YOU
FAVOR
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
TO
KEEP
KILLERS
FROM
KILLING
AGAIN
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
WE
SHOULD
DO
WITH
PEOPLE
WHO
COMMIT
OTHER
CRIMES
SUCH
AS
RAPE
OR
ROBBERY
ISNT
IT
THE
MUSLIMS

YOUR
HAND
OFF

YOURE
CAUGHT
