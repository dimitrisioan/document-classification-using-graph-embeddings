BY

THIS
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
QUESTION
AND
ILL
BE
ANXIOUS
TO
SEE
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
SUCH
CASES
I
DOUBT
IT
IN
THE
MEDIEVAL
PERIOD
ESP
WHEN

FLOURISHED
ARGUMENT
WAS
A
USEFUL
TOOL
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
KNEW
THE
RULES
TODAY
WHEN
YOU
CANT
COUNT
ON
PEOPLE
KNOWING
EVEN
THE
BASICS
OF
LOGIC
OR
SEEING
THROUGH
RHETORIC
A
GOOD
ARGUMENT
IS
OFTEN
INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM
A
POOR
ONE
THE
LAST
SENTENCE
IS
IRONIC
SINCE
SO
MANY
READERS
OF
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
SEEM
TO
NOT
BE
EMBARRASSED
BY

KNEW

TODAY
IF
WRITINGS
FROM
THE

SEEM
ELEVATED
CONSIDER
THAT
ONLY
THE
CREAM
OF
THE
CROP
SO
TO
SPEAK
COULD
READ
AND
WRITE
IF
EVERYONE
IN
THE
MEDIEVAL
PERIOD
KNEW
THE
RULES
IT
WAS
A
MATTER
OF
UNCRITICALLY
ACCEPTING
WHAT
THEY
WERE
TOLD
BILL
MAYNE
THIS
MAY
BE
UNFAIR
TO
LEWIS
THE
MOST
PROMINENT
FALLACY
ATTRIBUTED
TO
HIM
IS
THE
LIAR
LUNATIC

AS
