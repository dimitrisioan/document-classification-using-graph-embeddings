MY
PROBLEM
WITH
SCIENCE
IS
THAT
OFTEN
IT
ALLOWS
US
TO
ASSUME
WE
KNOW
WHAT
IS
BEST
FOR
OURSELVES
GOD
ENDOWED
US
WITH
THE
ABILITY
TO
PRODUCE
LIFE
THROUGH
SEXUAL
RELATIONS
YOU
ASSUME
THIS
BECAUSE
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
A
DESIGNING
CREATOR
AND
YOU
OBSERVE
OUR
ABILITY
TO
PROCREATE
FOR
EXAMPLE
BUT
HE
DID
NOT
MAKE
THAT
AVAILIBLE
TO
EVERYONE
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
IF
SCIENCE
CAN
OVERRIDE
GODS
DECISION
THROUGH
ALTERATIONS
THAT
GOD
WILLS
FOR
US
TO
HAVE
THE
POWER
TO
DECIDE
WHO
SHOULD
AND
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
CHILDREN
BUT
THEN
YOU
OBSERVE
OUR
ABILITY
TO
MODIFY
FERTILITY
THROUGH
INTELLIGENCE
EXPERIMENT
AND
DRAW
NO
SIMILAR
CONCLUSIONS
ABOUT
GOD
DESIGNING
US
FOR
SCIENTIFIC
INQUIRY
THE
USE
OF
THE
TECHNOLOGY
THAT
IT
PRODUCES
HOW
IS
IT
THAT
ONE
ABILITY
IS
OBVIOUSLY
FROM
GOD
AND
THE
OTHER
NOT
I
CANNOT
DRAW
A
SOLID
LINE
REGARDING
WHERE
I
WOULD
APPROVE
OF
SCIENTIFIC
STUDY
AND
WHERE
I
WOULD
NOT
BUT
I
WILL
SAY
THIS
BEFORE
ONE
EXPERIMENTS
WITH
THE
UNIVERSE
TO
FIND
OUT
ALL
ITS
SECRETS
ONE
SHOULD
ASK
WHY
THEY
WANT
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
AND
HOLD
THE
TRUTH
AS
THE
MOST
BASIC
OF
ALL
ETHICAL
VALUES
BECAUSE
CORRECT
MORAL
JUDGEMENT
RELIES
ON
KNOWING
THE
TRUTH
NOT
VICE
VERSA
MORALITIES
THAT
ASSERT
THAT
ASSENT
TO
A
BELIEF
IS
A
MORAL
CHOICE
AND
NOT
COMPELLED
BY
EVIDENCE
INEVITABLY
CUT
OFF
THE
LIMB
THEY
SIT
UPON
FALSIFICATION
OF
EVIDENCE
CONSCIOUS
AND
UNCONSCIOUS
FOLLOWS
CORRUPTING
BOTH
THE
INTELLECT
AND
THE
HEART
I
WILL
SAY
THAT
EACH
PERSON
SHOULD
PRAY
FOR
GUIDANCE
WHEN
TRYING
TO
UNRAVEL
THE
MYSTERIES
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
AND
SHOULD
CEASE
THEIR
UNRAVELLING
IF
THEY
HAVE
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THEIR
SEARCH
IS
DISPLEASING
TO
GOD
MALCUSCO
IF
THERE
IS
A
GOD
HE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
FEAR
FROM
TRUTH
AS
TO
IMAGINARY
GODS
AND
THERE
FOLLOWERS
BE
AFRAID
BE
VERY
AFRAID
MAX
