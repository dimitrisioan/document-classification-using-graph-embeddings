I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
FINDING
OUT
WHY
PEOPLE
BECOME
ATHEISTS
AFTER
HAVING
BELIEVED
IN
SOME
GODGOD
IN
CONVERSING
WITH
THEM
ON
OTHER
GROUPS
IVE
OFTEN
SENSED
ANGER
OR
HOSTILITY
THOUGH
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
IMPLY
THAT
ALL
ATHEISTS
ARE
ANGRY
OR
HOSTILE
IT
DOES
SEEM
TO
BE
ONE
MOTIVATION
FOR
GIVING
UP
FAITH
THUS
SOME
ATHEISM
MIGHT
RESULT
FROM
BROKENNESS
IM
ATHEIST
JUST
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
SUPREME
BEING
THERE
IS
THE
WORLD
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
AND
ITS
WONDERFUL
AND
INCREDIBLE
AND
THERE
IS
LOVE
BETWEEN
PEOPLE
AND
THESE
THINGS
ARE
EVERYTHING
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
A
GOD
THAT
MADE
THIS
ALL
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
AMAZING
AND
BEAUTIFUL
TEAMING
WITH
LIFE
WORLD
I
LIVE
IN
