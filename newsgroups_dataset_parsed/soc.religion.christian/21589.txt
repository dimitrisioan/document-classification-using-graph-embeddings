MICHAEL
COVINGTON
WRITES
I
HAVE
A
STRONG
PREFERENCE
FOR
EDITIONS
THAT
DO
NOT
INDENT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
EACH
VERSE
AS
IF
VERSES
WERE
PARAGRAPHS
THE
VERSE
NUMBERING
IS
A
RELATIVELY
MODERN
ADDITION
AND
SHOULD
NOT
BE
GIVEN
UNDUE
PROMINENCE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
OF
AN
ENGLISH
LANGUAGE
EDITION
THAT
DOES
NOT
SHOW
THE
VERSE
OR
EVEN
CHAPTER
NUMBERS
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
SUCH
AN
EDITION
WOULD
BE
VERY
USEFUL
ALTHOUGH
HARD
TO
NAVIGATE
AROUND
I
HAVE
A
SCOTS
NT
THAT
DOESNT
SHOW
VERSE
NUMBERS
AND
IT
IS
GREAT
TO
READ
PARTICULARLY
LONGER
NARRATIVE
PASSAGES
BUT
MY
SCOTS
ISNT
QUITE
UP
TO
DOING
PROPER
STUDY
FROM
THIS
EDITION
I
TEND
TO
USE
IT
TO
GET
A
FEEL
FOR
A
STORY
PARTICULARLY
IN
THE
GOSPELS
AND
THEN
USE
AN
ENGLISH
EDITION
TO
LOOK
FOR
DETAILS
ALISON
THE
ORIGINAL
NEB
PUT
VERSE
NUMBERS
ONLY
IN
THE
MARGIN
THE
JERUSALEM
BIBLE
DOES
THE
SAME
THOUGH
THEY
PUT
A
DOT
TO
MARK
THE
BOUNDARIES
BETWEEN
VERSES
