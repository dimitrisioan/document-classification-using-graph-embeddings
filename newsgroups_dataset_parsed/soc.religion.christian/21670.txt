HATE
THE
SIN
DATE
MAY
GMT
HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNERIVE
HEARD
THAT
QUITE
A
BIT
RECENTLY
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
THAT
STATEMENT
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
THINK
NOT
HATE
BEGETS
MORE
HATE
NEVER
LOVE
IF
YOU
ARE
QUESTIONING
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HATING
SIN
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
ASK
YOU
TO
CONSIDER
THE
FOLLOWING
SCRIPTURE
ROMANS
LET
LOVE
BE
WITHOUT
HYPOCRISY
HATE
WHAT
IS
EVIL
CLING
TO
WHAT
IS
GOOD
WHAT
IS
IT
THAT
PAUL
THROUGH
THE
INSPIRATION
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
IS
CALLING
US
TO
HATE
WOULD
GOD
CALL
US
TO
DO
SOMETHING
THAT
WOULD
EVENTUALLY
LEAD
TO
HATING
OUR
FELLOW
MAN
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
HE
COMMANDS
US
TO
DO
THE
OPPOSITE
TO
LOVE
YOUR
FELLOW
MAN
CONSIDER
SOME
SIN
NOW
LETS
APPLY
OUR
HATE
THE
SIN
PHILOSOPHY
AND
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
WE
TRULY
HATE
THE
SIN
THEN
THE
MORE
WE
SEE
IT
THE
STRONGER
OUR
HATRED
OF
IT
WILL
BECOME
EVENTUALLY
THIS
HATE
BECOMES
SO
STRONG
THAT
WE
BECOME
DISGUSTED
WITH
THE
SINNER
AND
EVENTUALLY
COME
TO
HATE
THE
SINNER
THAT
HAS
NOT
BEEN
MY
EXPERIENCE
IVE
NOT
FOUND
MYSELF
HATING
ANYBODY
AS
A
RESULT
OF
HATING
THE
SIN
THAT
MAY
BE
IN
THEIR
LIFE
AS
A
SINNER
MYSELF
I
FIND
MYSELF
HAVING
MORE
COMPASSION
FOR
THE
PERSON
JESUS
TOO
SINCE
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THAT
HE
WAS
TEMPTED
IN
EVERY
WAY
THAT
WE
ARE
IS
ABLE
TO
HAVE
COMPASSION
ON
US
WHEN
WE
OUR
TEMPTED
AND
FALL
JESUS
IS
OUR
VERY
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
TO
HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNER
IN
THE
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
WOMAN
CAUGHT
IN
ADULTERY
JOHN
JESUS
HAD
COMPASSION
ON
THE
WOMAN
BUT
HE
ALSO
CALLED
HER
TO
LEAVE
HER
LIFE
OF
SIN
THIS
IS
WHAT
IT
MEANS
TO
LOVE
SINNERS
BUT
HATE
THEIR
SIN
IT
MEANS
LOVING
THEM
UNCONDITIONALLY
WHILE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
CALLING
THEM
TO
LEAVE
THEIR
SIN
IN
ADDITION
OUR
HATRED
OF
THE
SIN
OFTEN
CAUSES
US
TO
SAY
AND
DO
THINGS
WHICH
ARE
TAKEN
PERSONALLY
BY
THE
SINNER
WHO
OFTEN
DOES
NOT
EVEN
BELIEVE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
IS
A
SIN
THE
BLAME
FOR
THIS
CAN
NOT
ALWAYS
BE
LAID
AT
THE
FEET
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
I
HAVE
SEEN
AND
BEEN
GUILTY
OF
TAKING
OFFENSE
BY
SOMEONE
MERELY
POINTING
OUT
MY
SIN
AND
CALLING
ME
TO
REPENT
OF
IT
IT
WAS
NOT
UNLOVING
FOR
THE
CHRISTIAN
TO
CALL
ME
OUT
OF
SIN
IN
FACT
I
BELIEVE
IT
WAS
THE
MOST
LOVING
THING
THAT
THAT
PERSON
COULD
HAVE
DONE
HE
LOVED
ME
ENOUGH
TO
WANT
TO
SPARE
ME
THE
CONSEQUENCE
OF
REMAINING
IN
MY
SIN
AFTER
ENOUGH
OF
THIS
THE
SINNER
BEGINS
TO
HATE
US
THEY
CERTAINLY
DONT
LOVE
US
FOR
OUR
CONSTANT
CRITICISM
OF
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
HATE
BUILDS
UP
AND
DRIVES
PEOPLE
AWAY
FROM
GODTHIS
CERTAINLY
CANNOT
BE
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
BUILD
LOVE
AGAIN
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
YOU
CAN
LAY
THE
BLAME
FOR
THIS
AT
THE
FEET
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
IF
WE
HAVE
LOVED
THEM
AS
JESUS
LOVED
SINNERS
EXEMPLIFIED
IN
JOHN
AND
THE
SINNER
HATES
US
FOR
IT
THEN
WE
HAVE
DONE
THE
BEST
WE
CAN
WE
WILL
HAVE
EXTENDED
TO
THEM
THE
MOST
PERFECT
EXPRESSION
OF
LOVE
AND
THEY
WILL
HAVE
REJECTED
IT
NOW
IT
WE
HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
FORGET
TO
LOVE
THE
SINNER
THEN
INDEED
WE
WILL
OURSELVES
BE
IN
SIN
IN
THE
SUMMARY
OF
THE
LAW
CHRIST
COMMANDS
US
TO
LOVE
GOD
AND
TO
LOVE
OUR
NEIGHBORS
HE
DOESNT
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HATE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ENCOURAGE
YOU
TO
DO
A
WORD
STUDY
ON
HATE
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
I
REALLY
THINK
THAT
YOU
WILL
BE
SURPRISED
IN
FACT
IF
ANYTHING
HE
COMMANDS
US
TO
SAVE
OUR
CRITICISMS
FOR
OURSELVES
CRITICISM
IS
VERY
DIFFERENT
FROM
CALLING
A
SINNER
TO
REPENT
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
IN
CHRIST
