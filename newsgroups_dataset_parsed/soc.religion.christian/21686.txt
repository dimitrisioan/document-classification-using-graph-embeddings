JAMES
AND
SIRACH
ON
THURSDAY
MAY
DAVE
DAVIS
WRITES
IM
LEANING
SIRACH
IS
MORE
DIRECTLY
REFERENCED
BY
JAMES
THAN
JOB
OR
RUTH
IS
IN
ANY
NT
VERSE
IVE
SEEN
IT
WOULD
HELP
IF
YOU
MENTIONED
CHAPTER
AND
VERSE
FROM
SIRACH
AND
FROM
JAMES
JOB
HE
TAKETH
THE
WISE
IN
THEIR
CRAFTINESS
SEEMS
TO
BE
QUOTED
IN
CORINTHIANS
JAMES
YOU
HAVE
HEARD
OF
THE
PATIENCE
OF
JOB
WHILE
NOT
A
QUOTE
IMPLIES
THAT
JAMES
AND
HIS
LISTENERS
ARE
FAMILIAR
WITH
A
STORY
OF
A
MAN
NAMED
JOB
WHO
EXHIBITED
EXEMPLARY
PATIENCE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
STORY
THEY
KNOW
IS
NOT
THAT
FOUND
IN
THE
HEBREW
BIBLE
BUT
RATHER
ANOTHER
SIMILAR
AND
RELATED
STORY
ONE
HAS
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
WITH
DIRECT
QUOTES
AGAIN
MATTHEW
BOAZ
BEGAT
OBED
OF
RUTH
TELLS
US
THAT
MATTHEW
KNEW
A
STORY
ABOUT
A
WOMAN
NAMED
RUTH
WHO
MARRIED
A
MAN
CALLED
BOAZ
AND
BECAME
THE
ANCESTOR
OF
DAVID
SINCE
RUTH
IS
NOT
MENTIONED
IN
THE
OT
OUTSIDE
THE
BOOK
OF
RUTH
IT
SEEMS
LIKELY
THAT
MATTHEW
WAS
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
BOOK
AND
RESPECTED
IT
AND
THOUGHT
RUTH
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
WOMEN
MENTIONED
IN
THE
GENEALOGY
REFERENCES
LIKE
THIS
DO
NOT
PROVE
THAT
THE
NT
WRITER
CONSIDERED
HIS
OT
SOURCE
INSPIRED
OR
INERRANT
OR
CANONICAL
BUT
NEITHER
DO
DIRECT
QUOTES
YOURS
