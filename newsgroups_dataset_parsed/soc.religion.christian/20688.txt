i
think
you
are
vastly
oversimplifying
things
we
know
that
early
christians
suffered
totures
because
of
their
witness
to
christ
for
example
act
it
appears
that
the
jewish
rulers
of
that
time
had
a
particular
aversion
to
even
hearing
jesuss
name
finally
the
first
apostles
death
james
of
zebedee
was
certainly
not
by
romes
hand
any
more
than
the
first
martyr
stephen
the
problem
was
that
if
one
believed
in
the
resurrection
then
one
must
believe
in
jesus
as
truly
being
the
son
of
god
and
what
he
stood
for
and
preached
during
his
ministry
on
earth
that
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
for
some
people
especially
those
that
had
plotted
to
kill
him
the
basic
problem
with
your
argument
is
your
total
and
complete
reliance
on
the
biblical
text
lukes
account
is
highly
suspect
i
would
refer
you
to
the
hermeneia
commentary
on
acts
moreover
lukes
account
is
written
at
least
years
after
the
fact
in
the
meantime
everyone
he
mentions
has
died
and
attempts
to
find
actual
written
sources
behind
the
text
have
come
up
with
only
the
we
section
of
the
later
portion
of
acts
as
firmly
established
moreover
pauls
account
of
some
of
the
events
in
acts
as
recorded
in
galatians
fail
to
establish
the
acts
accounts
what
we
need
therefore
is
a
reliable
text
critically
appreciated
which
documents
the
death
of
christians
for
belief
in
the
resurrection
i
would
suggest
you
look
at
some
greek
and
roman
historians
i
think
you
will
be
disapointed
