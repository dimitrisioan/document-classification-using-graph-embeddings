MY
STUFF
ABOUT
DEALING
WITH
DEFFERENCES
DELETED
THIS
IS
NOT
AT
ALL
COMPARABLE
CHRISTIANITY
IS
THE
MAIN
STREAM
IN
WESTERN
CULTURE
YOU
ARE
TRIVIALIZING
THE
EXPERIENCES
OF
OTHERS
I
AM
SORRY
I
DID
NOT
MEAN
TO
I
THINK
I
UNDERSTAND
HOW
YOUR
EXPERIENCES
WERE
MUCH
WORSE
THAN
THE
SMALL
BIT
OF
RIDICULE
I
HAVE
HAD
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
I
GUESS
I
DIDNT
REALLY
UNDERSTAND
BEFORE
NOW
I
DO
I
REMEMBER
WHAT
IT
WAS
LIKE
BEING
DIFFERENT
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
WE
WERE
TOLD
ALL
THE
TIME
THAT
WE
WERE
DIFFERENT
AND
IN
FACT
THAT
ONLY
MEMBERS
OF
THE
OUR
CHURCH
WERE
REALLY
CHRISTIANS
THOUGH
OTHERS
WHO
BELIEVED
IN
GOD
WERENT
AS
BAD
AS
ATHEISTS
SO
WE
WERE
A
SMALL
MINORITY
THAT
WAS
NOTHING
COMPARED
TO
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
WOW
PRETTY
CONSERVATIVE
CHURCH
PLEASE
EXCUSE
ME
IF
THIS
SEEMS
LIKE
A
RIDICULOUS
UNDERSTATEMENT
TO
YOU
THE
ONLY
THING
COMPARABLE
WOULD
BE
A
YOUNG
CHILD
BEING
CHRISTIAN
BEING
SURROUNDED
BY
STAUNCH
ATHEISTS
INCLUDING
PARENTS
WHO
ACTIVELY
PERSECUTE
ANY
RELIGIOUS
TENDANCIES
BOTH
ACTUAL
PUNISHMENTS
AND
EVEN
WORSE
EMOTIONAL
BLACKMAIL
THEY
WOULD
ALSO
HAVE
TO
HAVE
THE
WHOLE
MAINSTREAM
SOCIETY
ON
THEIR
SIDE
MAYBE
THESE
CONDITIONS
COULD
HAVE
OCCURED
IN
THE
OLD
SOVIET
UNION
NOT
IN
A
COUNTRY
WITH
UNDER
GOD
IN
ITS
PLEDGE
OF
ALLEGIANCE
ON
A
SIDE
NOTE
THAT
UNDER
GOD
WASNT
IN
THERE
UNTIL
RECENTLY
I
BELIEVE
MY
FATHER
WHO
IS
IN
HIS
SIXTIES
REMEMBERS
SAYING
THE
PLEDGE
OF
ALLEGIANCE
WITHOUT
THAT
IN
THERE
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
HISTORY
BEHIND
THAT
THOUGH
EMOTIONAL
BLACKMAIL
OUCH
THANK
GOODNESS
ILL
BE
NEUTRAL
IN
MY
THANKS
HERE
I
WAS
RAISED
IN
A
COMPLETELY
TOLERANT
HOUSEHOLD
SO
THAT
I
COULD
MAKE
MY
OWN
DECISIONS
I
DOUBT
IT
EVEN
THEN
BECAUSE
CHILDREN
HAVE
TO
BE
TAUGHT
TO
BE
CHRISTIANS
AND
HENCE
MUST
HAVE
SUPPORT
SOMEWHERE
SO
ATHEISM
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
BE
TAUGHT
BUT
CHRISTIANITY
DOES
I
GUESS
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
ALTHOUGH
I
CAN
SEE
A
CHILD
BELIEVING
IN
SOME
SORT
OF
GOD
WITHOUT
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
HIS
HER
OWN
IMAGINATION
AS
A
BASIS
SORRY
I
GUESS
THIS
IS
SORT
OF
MINOR
MY
QUERY
ABOUT
PARALLEL
BETWEEN
LACK
OF
CHOICE
FOR
HOMOSEXUALS
AND
LACK
OF
CHOICE
FOR
HIM
AS
AN
ATHEIST
DELETED
YES
MY
ATHEISM
WAS
BORN
OF
NECESSITY
FOR
AN
INTELLECTUALLY
HONEST
PERSON
BELIEF
IS
MOSTLY
A
RESPONSE
TO
EVIDENCE
HMM
I
WONDER
WHY
I
AM
A
CHRISTIAN
THEN
THIS
ISNT
A
FLAME
THIS
IS
A
REAL
WONDER
DOES
ANYONE
ELSE
HAVE
OPINIONS
TO
OFFER
ON
WHY
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
SOMETHING
THAT
HASNT
NECESSARILY
BEEN
PROVEN
TO
YOU
WILL
OR
WISHES
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
I
COULD
CHOOSE
TO
LIE
OR
TO
BE
SILENT
ABOUT
MY
TRUE
BELIEFS
I
COULD
NO
MORE
CHOOSE
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
GOD
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THAN
I
COULD
DECIDE
THAT
THE
ORDINARY
SKY
LOOKS
RED
TO
ME
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOU
ARE
AN
ATHEIST
BY
NATURE
THEN
OR
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
AT
LEAST
PART
OF
IT
IS
DUE
TO
THE
APPARENTLY
REPRESSIVE
NATURE
OF
THE
CHRISTIANITY
OF
YOUR
CHILDHOOD
IF
THIS
IS
GETTING
TOO
PERSONAL
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULD
IGNORE
IT
OR
WE
CAN
TAKE
IT
TO
EMAIL
STILL
I
SHOULD
BE
CLEAR
THAT
IM
NOT
EQUATING
WHAT
I
WENT
THROUGH
WITH
WHAT
GAYS
GO
THROUGH
HOWEVER
IT
IS
A
MISTAKE
TO
ASSUME
THAT
EVERYONE
WHO
GOES
THROUGH
PAINFUL
EXPERIENCES
ARE
BROKEN
BY
THEM
HAPPILY
SOME
ARE
MADE
STRONGER
ONCE
WE
GET
PAST
IT
THIS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
A
GENERAL
REMARK
YOU
DO
NOT
SOUND
BROKEN
TO
ME
BUT
INDEED
STRONGER
I
MUST
SAY
THAT
I
WASNT
HURT
BY
MY
EXPERIENCES
IN
CHURCH
ANY
MORE
THAN
SOME
OF
MY
FRIENDS
WHO
DIDNT
BECOME
ATHEISTS
I
WAS
JUST
HURT
DIFFERENTLY
IM
NOT
SURE
I
UNDERSTAND
THIS
SENTENCE
COULD
YOU
EXPLAIN
NOT
WITHOUT
GOING
TO
DETAILS
AND
VIOLATING
THE
CONFIDENCES
OF
SOME
OF
MY
CHILDHOOD
FRIENDS
SUFFICE
IT
SAY
TO
THAT
RELIGION
DOES
NOT
GUARANTEE
THAT
A
PERSON
WILL
BE
HAPPY
AND
STRONG
EMOTIONALLY
AND
A
REPRESSIVE
UPBRINGING
CAN
LEAVE
ITS
SCARS
EVEN
OR
ESPECIALLY
ON
THOSE
WHO
DONT
GET
FREE
OF
IT
I
DOUBT
THAT
ANY
SANE
AND
SINCERE
PERSON
DOUBTS
THAT
AND
I
FEEL
NO
NEED
TO
DEFEND
IT
YES
I
AGREE
WITH
THAT
IVE
SEEN
SOME
OF
THE
DAMAGE
REPRESSIVE
RELIGION
CAN
DO
AND
AS
A
RESULT
I
INTEND
TO
RAISE
MY
OWN
CHILDREN
AS
MUCH
AS
I
CAN
TO
LOOK
AROUND
BEFORE
ACCEPTING
ONE
RELIGIOUS
STAND
ATHEISM
IS
INCLUDED
IN
THIS
AND
TO
QUESTION
EVERYTHING
THIS
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
BY
THE
WAY
I
AM
MUCH
HAPPIER
AND
STRONGER
BEING
OUT
OF
THE
CLOSET
IN
THE
END
IT
HAS
BEEN
AS
SOMEONE
ELOQUENTLY
PUT
IT
IN
PRIVATE
EMAIL
AN
EXPERIENCE
OF
LIBERATION
RATHER
THAN
DISILLUSION
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
