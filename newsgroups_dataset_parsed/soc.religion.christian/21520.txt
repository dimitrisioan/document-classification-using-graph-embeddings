RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
EUGENEBIGELOWEBAYSUNCOM
GENO
WRITES
JOSEPH
H
BUEHLER
WRITES
THIS
ALL
OBVIOUSLY
APPLIES
EQUALLY
WELL
TO
INFANTS
OR
ADULTS
SINCE
BOTH
HAVE
SOULS
INFANTS
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
THEREFORE
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
THEY
TOO
NEED
THIS
FORM
OF
LIFE
IN
THEM
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
BAPTISM
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
ASKING
JESUS
TO
COME
INTO
YOUR
HEART
AND
ACCEPTING
HIM
AS
YOUR
SAVIOR
BUT
IS
JUST
A
RITUAL
THAT
WE
MUST
GO
THROUGH
TO
ENABLE
US
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
MY
FEELING
ON
BAPTISM
IS
THIS
PARENTS
BAPTIZE
THEIR
BABY
SO
THAT
THE
BABY
HAS
THE
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
OF
BAPTISM
AND
THUS
REMOVAL
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
ON
ITS
SOUL
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
AN
UNEXPECTED
DEATH
THAT
IS
THE
PARENTS
SPEAK
ON
BEHALF
OF
THE
CHILD
WHICH
IS
TOO
YOUNG
TO
SPEAK
ON
ITS
OWN
THIS
SHOULD
NOT
SURPRISE
ANYONE
DONT
PARENTS
ALWAYS
DO
WHAT
THEY
BELIEVE
IS
THE
BEST
FOR
THEIR
BABY
WHY
WOULD
THAT
APPLY
TO
THE
BABYS
PHYSICAL
NEEDS
ONLY
BUT
NOT
HISHER
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
TO
HAVE
GODS
GRACE
THE
PURPOSE
OF
CONFIRMATION
IS
FOR
THE
BABY
NOW
YOUNG
ADULT
TO
DECIDE
TO
REAFFIRM
FOR
HIMSELFHERSELF
THE
PROMISES
THAT
HISHER
PARENTS
MADE
AT
BAPTISM
THAT
IS
WHERE
ACCEPTING
JESUS
INTO
YOUR
HEART
COMES
IN
IN
BAPTISM
THE
PARENTS
ASK
JESUS
TO
COME
INTO
THEIR
BABYS
HEART
AT
CONFIRMATION
THE
CHILD
REPEATS
THAT
REQUEST
INDEPENDENTLY
BY
THE
WAY
THESE
ARE
MY
PERSONAL
FEELINGS
THOUGH
I
BELIEVE
THEY
ARE
PRETTY
CLOSE
TO
WHAT
THE
DOCTRINAL
POSITION
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
ON
THIS
ISSUE
CAN
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
BACK
ME
UP
OR
CORRECT
ME
