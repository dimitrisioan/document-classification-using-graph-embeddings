THE
WITNESS
OF
THE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
MARK
AND
HE
BEGAN
TO
TEACH
THEM
THAT
THE
SON
OF
MAN
MUST
SUFFER
MANY
THINGS
AND
BE
REJECTED
BY
THE
ELDERS
AND
THE
CHIEF
PRIESTS
AND
THE
SCRIBES
AND
BE
KILLED
AND
AFTER
THREE
DAYS
RISE
AGAIN
MARK
FOR
HE
WAS
TEACHING
HIS
DISCIPLES
AND
TELLING
THEM
THE
SON
OF
MAN
IS
TO
BE
DELIVERED
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
MEN
AND

RISE
THREE
DAYS
LATER
MARK
AND
THEY
WILL
MOCK
HIM
AND
SPIT
UPON
HIM
AND
SCOURGE
HIM
AND
KILL
HIM
AND
THREE
DAYS
LATER
HE
WILL
RISE
AGAIN
MARK
BUT
REGARDING
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
DEAD
RISE
AGAIN
HAVE
YOU
NOT
READ
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
MOSES
IN
THE
PASSAGE
ABOUT
THE
BURNING
BUSH
HOW
GOD
SPOKE
TO
HIM
SAYING
I
AM
THE
GOD
OF
ABRAHAM
AND
THE
GOD
OF
ISAAC
AND
THE
GOD
OF
JACOB
LUKE
AND
AFTER
THEY
HAVE
SCOURGED
HIM
THEY
WILL
KILL
HIM
AND
THE
THIRD
DAY
HE
WILL
RISE
AGAIN
LUKE
AND
HE
SAID
TO
THEM
THUS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
THAT
THE
CHRIST
SHOULD
SUFFER
AND
RISE
AGAIN
FROM
THE
DEAD
THE
THIRD
DAY
JOHN
JESUS
SAID
TO
HER
I
AM
THE
RESURRECTION
AND
THE
LIFE
HE
WHO
BELIEVES
IN
ME
SHALL
LIVE
EVEN
IF
HE
DIES
JOHN
FOR
AS
YET
THEY
DID
NOT
UNDERSTAND
THE
SCRIPTURE
THAT
HE
MUST
RISE
AGAIN
FROM
THE
DEAD
ACTS
EXPLAINING
AND
GIVING
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
CHRIST
HAD
TO
SUFFER
AND
RISE
AGAIN
FROM
THE
DEAD
AND
SAYING
THIS
JESUS
WHOM
I
AM
PROCLAIMING
TO
YOU
IS
THE
CHRIST
THE
WITNESS
OF
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
CORINTHIANS
NOW
I
MAKE
KNOWN
TO
YOU
BRETHREN
THE
GOSPEL
WHICH
I
PREACHED
TO
YOU
WHICH
ALSO
YOU
RECEIVED
IN
WHICH
ALSO
YOU
STAND
BY
WHICH
ALSO
YOU
ARE
SAVED
IF
YOU
HOLD
FAST
THE
WORD
WHICH
I
PREACHED
TO
YOU
UNLESS
YOU
BELIEVED
IN
VAIN
FOR
I
DELIVERED
TO
YOU
AS
OF
FIRST
IMPORTANCE
WHAT
I
ALSO
RECEIVED
THAT
CHRIST
DIED
FOR
OUR
SINS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
THAT
HE
WAS
BURIED
AND
THAT
HE
WAS
RAISED
ON
THE
THIRD
DAY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
THAT
HE
APPEARED
TO
CEPHAS
THEN
TO
THE
TWELVE
AFTER
THAT
HE
APPEARED
TO
MORE
THAN
FIVE
HUNDRED
BRETHREN
AT
ONE
TIME
MOST
OF
WHOM
REMAIN
UNTIL
NOW
BUT
SOME
HAVE
FALLEN
ASLEEP
THEN
HE
APPEARED
TO
JAMES
THEN
TO
ALL
THE
APOSTLES
AND
LAST
OF
ALL
AS
IT
WERE
TO
ONE
UNTIMELY
BORN
HE
APPEARED
TO
ME
ALSO
FOR
I
AM
THE
LEAST
OF
THE
APOSTLES
WHO
AM
NOT
FIT
TO
BE
CALLED
AN
APOSTLE
BECAUSE
I
PERSECUTED
THE
CHURCH
OF
GOD
BUT
BY
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
I
AM
WHAT
I
AM
AND
HIS
GRACE
TOWARD
ME
DID
NOT
PROVE
VAIN
BUT
I
LABORED
EVEN
MORE
THAN
ALL
OF
THEM
YET
NOT
I
BUT
THE
GRACE
OF
GOD
WITH
ME
WHETHER
THEN
IT
WAS
I
OR
THEY
SO
WE
PREACH
AND
SO
YOU
BELIEVED
NOW
IF
CHRIST
IS
PREACHED
THAT
HE
HAS
BEEN
RAISED
FROM
THE
DEAD
HOW
DO
SOME
AMONG
YOU
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
BUT
IF
THERE
IS
NO
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
NOT
EVEN
CHRIST
HAS
BEEN
RAISED
AND
IF
CHRIST
HAS
NOT
BEEN
RAISED
THEN
OUR
PREACHING
IS
VAIN
YOUR
FAITH
ALSO
IS
VAIN
MOREOVER
WE
ARE
EVEN
FOUND
TO
BE
FALSE
WITNESSES
OF
GOD
BECAUSE
WE
WITNESSED
AGAINST
GOD
THAT
HE
RAISED
CHRIST
WHOM
HE
DID
NOT
RAISE
IF
IN
FACT
THE
DEAD
ARE
NOT
RAISED
FOR
IF
THE
DEAD
ARE
NOT
RAISED
NOT
EVEN
CHRIST
HAS
BEEN
RAISED
AND
IF
CHRIST
HAS
NOT
BEEN
RAISED
YOUR
FAITH
IS
WORTHLESS
YOU
ARE
STILL
IN
YOUR
SINS
THEN
THOSE
ALSO
WHO
HAVE
FALLEN
ASLEEP
IN
CHRIST
HAVE
PERISHED
IF
WE
HAVE
HOPED
IN
CHRIST
IN
THIS
LIFE
ONLY
WE
ARE
OF
ALL
MEN
MOST
TO
BE
PITIED
BUT
NOW
CHRIST
HAS
BEEN
RAISED
FROM
THE
DEAD
THE
FIRST
FRUITS
OF
THOSE
WHO
ARE
ASLEEP
FOR
SINCE
BY
A
MAN
CAME
DEATH
BY
A
MAN
ALSO
CAME
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THE
DEAD
FOR
AS
IN
ADAM
ALL
DIE
SO
ALSO
IN
CHRIST
ALL
SHALL
BE
MADE
ALIVE
BUT
EACH
IN
HIS
OWN
ORDER
CHRIST
THE
FIRST
FRUITS
AFTER
THAT
THOSE
WHO
ARE
CHRISTS
AT
HIS
COMING
THEN
COMES
THE
END
WHEN
HE
DELIVERS
UP
THE
KINGDOM
TO
THE
GOD
AND
FATHER
WHEN
HE
HAS
ABOLISHED
ALL
RULE
AND
ALL
AUTHORITY
AND
POWER
FOR
HE
MUST
REIGN
UNTIL
HE
HAS
PUT
ALL
HIS
ENEMIES
UNDER
HIS
FEET
THE
LAST
ENEMY
THAT
WILL
BE
ABOLISHED
IS
DEATH
LOGICAL
PROOFS
OF
JESUS
CHRISTS
RESURRECTION
JESUSS
ENEMIES
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
STOLEN
HIS
BODY
BECAUSE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
PERPETRATED
THE
RESURRECTIONTHE
VERY
OPPOSITE
OF
WHAT
THEY
DESIRED
JESUS
DISCIPLES
COULD
NOT
HAVE
STOLEN
HIS
BODY
BECAUSE
PONTIUS
PILATE
ESTABLISHED
GUARDS
TO
STAND
WATCH
OVER
THE
TOMB
LEST
HIS
BODY
BE
STOLEN
SADLY
AND
IRONICALLY
MANY
OF
JESUS
DISCIPLES
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
UNTIL
JESUS
HAD
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
IN
NEARLY
CENTURIES
NO
BODY
HAS
EVER
BEEN
PRODUCED
TO
REFUTE
JESUS
ASSERTION
THAT
HE
WOULD
INDEED
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
PERPETRATE
SUCH
A
HOAX
SUCCESSFULLY
UPON
THE
ENTIRE
WORLD
FOR
NEARLY
CENTURIES
IS
ASTRONOMICALLY
NEGATIVE
