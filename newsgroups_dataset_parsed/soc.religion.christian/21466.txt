VIEWS
OF
THE
TRINITY
CANT
SOMEONE
DESCRIBE
SOMEONES
TRINITY
IN
SIMPLE
DECLARATIVE
SENTENCES
WITH
WORDS
THAT
HAVE
COMMON
MEANING
WHEN
I
NEED
A
KICKBUTT
GOD
OR
WHEN
I
NEED
ASSURANCE
OF
THE
REALITY
OF
TRUTH
I
PRAY
TO
GOD
THE
FATHER
WHEN
I
NEED
A
FRIEND
SOMEONE
TO
PUT
HIS
ARM
AROUND
ME
AND
CRY
WITH
ME
I
PRAY
TO
JESUS
WHEN
I
NEED
STRENGTH
OR
WISDOM
TO
GET
THROUGH
A
DIFFICULT
SITUATION
I
PRAY
FOR
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
I
REALIZE
THAT
THE
ABOVE
WILL
PROBABLY
MAKE
SOME
PEOPLE
CRINGE
BUT
WHAT
CAN
I
SAY
I
THINK
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
TRINITY
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
RECONCILE
JESUS
BEING
GOD
AND
BEING
DISTINCT
FROM
GOD
AS
DESCRIBED
IN
THE
BIBLE
I
WONDER
IF
JESUS
HAD
BEEN
A
HINDU
HOW
DIFFERENT
THE
WORDING
WOULD
BE
