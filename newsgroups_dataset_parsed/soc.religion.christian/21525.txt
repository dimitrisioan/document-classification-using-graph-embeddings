ANDREW
STATED
THAT
KECHARITOMENE
MEANS
NOT
JUST
FULL
OF
GRACE
BUT
HAVING
A
PLENITUDE
OR
PERFECTION
OF

THE
WORD
IS
USED
ELSEWHERE
IN

IN

TRANSLATION
I
CANNOT
FIND
ANY
INDICATION
IN
MY
DICTIONARY
THAT
THE
VERB
IMPLIES
ANYTHING
AS
STRONG
AS
ANDREW
SUGGESTS
NOR
DOES
THE
EPHESIANS
PASSAGE
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
VERB
MEANS
TO
PRESERVE
FROM
ANY
TAINT
OF
ORIGINAL
OR
ACTUAL
SIN
FROM
THE
FIRST
MOMENT
OF
EXISTENCE
I
SHOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
A
COMMENT
ON
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
VERB
PREFERABLY
NOT
FROM

WRITER
WHO
IS
DISCUSSING
