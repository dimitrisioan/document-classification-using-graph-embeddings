RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
IN
ARTICLE
EUGENEBIGELOWEBAYSUNCOM
WRITES
THIS
ALL
OBVIOUSLY
APPLIES
EQUALLY
WELL
TO
INFANTS
OR
ADULTS
SINCE
BOTH
HAVE
SOULS
INFANTS
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
THEREFORE
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
THEY
TOO
NEED
THIS
FORM
OF
LIFE
IN
THEM
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
BAPTISM
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
ASKING
JESUS
TO
COME
INTO
YOUR
HEART
AND
ACCEPTING
HIM
AS
YOUR
SAVIOR
BUT
IS
JUST
A
RITUAL
THAT
WE
MUST
GO
THROUGH
TO
ENABLE
US
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
I
DONT
THINK
JOE
WAS
SAYING
ANY
SUCH
THING
HOWEVER
YOUR
QUESTION
ON
ASKING
JESUS
TO
COME
INTO
YOUR
HEART
SEEMS
TO
IMPLY
THAT
INFANTS
ARE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
CHRIST
IN
THEIRS
WHY
MUST
BAPTISM
ALWAYS
BE
VIEWED
BY
SOME
PEOPLE
AS
A
SORT
OF
PRODIGAL
SON
TYPE
OF
THING
IE
A
SUDDEN
CHANGE
OF
HEART
GOING
FROM
NOT
ACCEPTING
CHRIST
TO
SUDDENLY
ACCEPTING
CHRIST
WHY
CANT
PEOPLE
START
OUT
WITH
CHRIST
FROM
SHORTLY
AFTER
BIRTH
AND
BUILD
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
FROM
THERE
AFTER
ALL
DOES
A
MAN
SUDDENLY
MEET
A
WOMAN
AND
THEN
MARRY
HER
THAT
SAME
DAY
FROM
MY
EXPERIENCES
IVE
LEARNED
THAT
ALL
RELATIONSHIPS
MUST
BE
BUILT
INCLUDING
ONES
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
ALSO
JOE
IS
SPEAKING
FROM
THE
STANDPOINT
THAT
BAPTISM
IS
NOT
JUST
A
RITUAL
BUT
THAT
THROUGH
IT
GOD
BESTOWS
SACRAMENTAL
GRACE
UPON
THE
RECIPIENT
CERTAINLY
FOR
THOSE
WITH
THE
MENTAL
FACULTIES
TO
KNOW
CHRIST
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
HOWEVER
THE
SACRAMENT
ITSELF
BESTOWS
GRACE
ON
THE
RECIPIENT
AND
MAKES
A
PERMANENT
MARK
OF
ADOPTION
INTO
GODS
FAMILY
ON
THE
SOUL
