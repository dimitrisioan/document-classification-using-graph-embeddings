MUSLIM
TITHE
SEXISM
IN
GENESIS
ACCORDING
TO
MDBSMSUKYEDU
MUSLIMS
TITHE
OF
THEIR
INCOME
PERHAPS
THERE
ARE
SOME
OFFSHOOTS
OF
ISLAM
THAT
IMPOSE
THIS
ON
THEIR
FOLLOWERS
BUT
THE
STANDARD
TITHE
IS
OF
ONES
NET
WORTH
ONCE
A
YEAR
THE
SAME
WRITER
ALSO
OBJECTS
TO
THE
BIBLE
FOR
TEACHING
THAT
WOMAN
WAS
CREATED
AFTER
MAN
TO
BE
HIS
HELPER
ETC
THIS
IS
PRESUMABLY
A
REFERENCE
TO
GENESIS
SUPPOSE
THAT
THAT
CHAPTER
HAD
BEEN
WRITTEN
WITH
THE
SEXES
REVERSED
WE
HAVE
GOD
CREATING
WOMAN
AND
THEN
SAYING
IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
THAT
WOMAN
SHOULD
BE
ALONE
I
WILL
MAKE
A
HELP
MEET
FOR
HER
FEMINISTS
WOULD
BE
OUTRAGED
THE
CLEAR
IMPLICATION
WOULD
BE
THAT
GOD
HAD
STARTED
AT
THE
BOTTOM
AND
WORKED
UP
MAKING
FIRST
THE
PLANTS
THEN
THE
FISH
AND
BIRDS
THEN
THE
BEASTS
THEN
WOMAN
AND
FINALLY
HIS
MASTERPIECE
THE
MALE
CHAUVINIST
PIG
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
WOMAN
IS
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
FUNCTIONING
BY
HERSELF
THAT
SHE
NEEDS
A
MAN
TO
OPEN
DOORS
FOR
HER
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
SEEN
AS
A
PARTICULARLY
GRATUITOUS
INSULT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CREATION
OF
WOMAN
FROM
THE
DUST
OF
THE
GROUND
WAS
GIVEN
ONLY
BRIEFLY
AND
IN
GENERAL
WHILE
THE
CREATION
OF
THE
MAN
WAS
GIVEN
IN
SIX
TIMES
THE
NUMBER
OF
WORDS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
CITED
AS
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
AUTHORS
ESTIMATE
OF
THE
RELATIVE
IMPORTANCE
OF
THE
SEXES
THE
VERDICT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
UNEQUIVOCAL
NO
SELFRESPECTING
WOMAN
CAN
ACCEPT
THIS
BOOK
AS
A
MORAL
GUIDE
OR
AS
ANYTHING
BUT
SEXIST
TRASH
I
SUGGEST
THAT
MOSES
FEARING
THIS
REACTION
ALTERED
HIS
ORIGINAL
DRAFT
AND
DESCRIBED
THE
CREATION
WITH
ADAM
FIRST
AND
THEN
EVE
SO
AS
TO
APPEASE
MIRIAM
AND
OTHER
RADICAL
FEMINISTS
OF
THE
DAY
FOR
SOME
REASON
HOWEVER
IT
DID
NOT
WORK
