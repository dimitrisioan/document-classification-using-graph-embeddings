RE
WHAT
WAS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
BIBLICAL
BASIS
FOR
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
I
WILL
PUT
ENMITY
BETWEEN
YOU
THE
SERPENT
AND
THE
WOMAN
AND
BETWEEN
YOUR
SEED
AND
HER
SEED
SHE
CAN
ALSO
BE
READ
HE
SHALL
CRUSH
YOUR
HEAD
AND
YOU
SHALL
BRUISE
HER
OR
HIS
HEEL
GENESIS
HE
WHO
COMMITS
SIN
IS
OF
THE
DEVIL
JOHN
HAIL
FULL
OF
GRACE
GREEK
KECHARITOMENE
THE
LORD
IS
WITH
THEE
LUKE
FROM
THE
ABOVE
WE
PROVE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
FIRST
GOD
HAS
GIVEN
THE
PROTOEVANGEL
IN
GENESIS
WHICH
IS
THE
FIRST
PROMISE
OF
A
SAVIOR
WHO
WILL
REDEEM
MANKIND
FROM
THE
WILES
OF
SATAN
SATAN
WAS
A
MURDERER
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
AND
HAS
NOT
STOOD
IN
THE
TRUTH
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
NO
TRUTH
IN
HIM
JOHN
NOW
THE
PROTOEVANGEL
PROMISES
SEVERAL
THINGS
ENMITY
BETWEEN
SATAN
AND
THE
WOMAN
AND
ENMITY
BETWEEN
SATAN
AND
HER
SEED
NOW
THE
WOMAN
IS
BOTH
EVE
WHO
IS
THE
IMMEDIATE
POINT
OF
REFERENCE
AND
MARY
THE
SECOND
EVE
HER
SEED
IS
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
HE
IS
ALSO
AT
ENMITY
WITH
SATAN
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
AS
MARY
IS
SAID
TO
BE
AT
ENMITY
WITH
SATAN
THUS
KNOWING
AS
WE
DO
THAT
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
SINLESS
HEBREWS
WE
CAN
CONCLUDE
THAT
MARY
IS
ALSO
SINLESS
BECAUSE
IF
SHE
WASNT
SHE
WOULD
NOT
BE
AT
ENMITY
WITH
THE
DEVIL
AS
JOHN
TELLS
US
AND
THE
RELATION
OF
HER
SINLESSNESS
TO
CHRISTS
SINLESSNESS
WOULD
BE
CALLED
INTO
QUESTION
AS
WOULD
GODS
VERACITY
FOR
GOD
PROMISED
AN
ENMITY
BETWEEN
MARY
AND
THE
SERPENT
AND
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
FOR
GOD
TO
LIE
OR
BE
DECIEVED
SECOND
WE
HAVE
THE
ANGELIC
GREETING
WHERE
MARY
IS
CALLED
BY
THE
ARCHANGLE
GABRIEL
FULL
OF
GRACE
AS
I
POINTED
OUT
ABOVE
THIS
IS
FROM
THE
GREEK
WORD
KECHARITOMENE
WHICH
MEANS
NOT
JUST
FULL
OF
GRACE
BUT
A
PLENITUDE
OR
PERFECTION
OF
GRACE
THE
SENSE
OF
IT
IS
BEST
GRASPED
BY
THE
FOOTNOTE
TO
THE
JERUSALEM
BIBLE
HAIL
YOU
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
AND
REAMIN
FILLED
WITH
GRACE
BUT
THAT
IS
A
LITTLE
TO
LONG
TO
SAY
SO
IT
IS
REDUCED
TO
FULL
OF
GRACE
AND
AS
IT
SAYS
YOU
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
MARY
HAD
ALWAYS
BEEN
FILLED
WITH
GRACE
FROM
THE
MOMENT
OF
HER
CONCEPTION
WHICH
WAS
ALSO
THE
MOMENT
OF
HER
SALVATION
UNTIL
HER
DEATH
SOME
YEARS
LATER
IT
MUST
BE
ADMITTED
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
GOD
COULD
HAVE
DONE
WHAT
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
IMMACLUTE
CONCEPTION
SAYS
HE
DID
DO
AND
IF
GOD
COULD
KEEP
HIMSELF
FREE
FROM
ANY
CONTACT
WITH
SIN
THROUGH
HIS
MOTHER
HE
WOULD
HAVE
AND
THE
BIBLE
RECORDS
THIS
FACT
TO
WHICH
THE
FATHERS
OF
THE
CHURCH
SUCH
AS
ST
JOHN
DAMASCUS
ST
AUGUSTINE
OF
HIPPO
ST
AMBROSE
AND
OTHERS
ARE
IN
COMPLETE
AGREEMENT
WITH
AS
IS
ALL
OF
CHRISTIAN
TRADITION
AND
AS
IS
THE
INFALLIBLE
DECLARATION
OF
THE
POPE
ON
THE
MATTER
IN
INEFFIBILUS
