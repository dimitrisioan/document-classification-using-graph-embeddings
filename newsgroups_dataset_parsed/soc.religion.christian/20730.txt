RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ARTICLE
MARK
BAKER
WRITES
I
AM
ASKING
YOU
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THINGS
NOT
VISIBLE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
BELIEVEING
BLINDLY
OR
NOT
IM
NOT
SURE
HOW
BLINDNESS
COMES
INTO
IT
I
DO
NOT
DENY
REASON
INDEED
I
INSIST
UPON
IT
BUT
REASON
ONLY
DRAWS
CONCLUSIONS
FROM
EVIDENCE
IF
YOU
DECIDE
IN
ADVANCE
THAT
YOUR
REASON
WILL
ACT
ONLY
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
FIVE
PHYSICAL
SENSES
THEN
YOU
CUT
REASON
OFF
FROM
ANY
POSSIBILITY
OF
REACHING
A
CONCLUSION
OUTSIDE
THE
PHYSICAL
SPHERE
BEYOND
THE
RATHER
PROVOCATIVE
IF
INCONCLUSIVE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
PHYSICAL
SPHERE
IS
NOT
SELF
EXPLANATORY
SO
YOUR
ARE
SAYING
TO
RELY
ON
OUR
FEELINGS
AND
EXPERIENCES
SINCE
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
OTHER
SOURCE
OF
INFORMATION
LEFT
TO
US
HOW
CAN
YOU
THEN
CONVINCE
SOMEBODY
THAT
YOUR
FEELINGS
AND
EXPERIENCES
ARE
THE
CORRECT
ONES
THEN
IF
YOU
CANT
SHOW
SOMEBODY
VISIBLE
AND
MEASURABLE
EFFECTS
IF
MY
EXPERIENCES
SAY
THAT
THERE
EXISTS
NO
GOD
AND
YOURS
SAYS
THERE
DOES
WHERE
DOES
THAT
LEAVE
US
SINCE
WE
ARE
ONLY
GOING
ON
EXPERIENCES
THEN
BOTH
OF
US
ARE
CORRECT
WITHIN
OUR
OWN
PERSONAL
REALITIES
FURTHERMORE
THE
TROUBLE
WITH
FEELINGS
AND
EXPERIENCES
IS
THAT
THEY
CAN
LEAD
YOU
ASTRAY
AS
THE
TRAGIC
OUTCOME
OF
WACO
ILLUSTRATES
I
AM
SURE
THAT
MANY
OF
KORESHS
FOLLOWERS
REALLY
BELIEVED
IN
HIM
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
AND
I
WILL
AGREE
THAT
THEY
WERE
BEING
MISLED
FINALLY
HOW
ON
EARTH
DO
YOU
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
PHYSICAL
SPHERE
IS
NOT
SELFEXPLANATORY
WHEN
YOU
ONLY
RELY
ON
THE
FIVE
SENSES
CHRISTIANS
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
HAVE
RECEIVED
A
DIFFERENT
KIND
OF
EVIDENCE
WHICH
THEY
CALL
FAITH
AND
WHICH
IS
A
GIFT
OF
GOD
THAT
IS
THIS
EVIDENCE
IS
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
A
THING
WHICH
CHOOSES
TO
REVEAL
OR
HIDE
ITSELF
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
SENSES
CANNOT
TELL
YOU
IS
SUCH
A
TING
EXISTS
REASONING
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
SENSES
WONT
HELP
EITHER
BUT
CHRISTIANS
DO
REASON
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
FAITH
AND
DO
CLAIM
THAT
THIS
EVIDENCE
IS
WHOLLY
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
OTHER
SENSES
AND
INDEED
THAT
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THESE
OTHER
SENSES
IS
PART
OF
GODS
REVELATION
OF
HIMSELF
TO
US
YOU
MUST
BE
USING
A
DEFINITION
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
TO
ME
EVIDENCE
IS
SOMETHING
YOU
CAN
SHOW
OTHERS
UNAMBIGUOUSLY
THAT
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
IS
TRUE
HOWEVER
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
BELIEF
IN
A
DIETY
IS
A
MATTER
OF
FAITH
IT
IS
NOT
SOMETHING
YOU
CAN
SHARE
AROUND
OTHERS
MUST
EXPERIENCE
IT
INDEPENDANTLY
UNFORTUNATELY
AS
I
HAVE
EXPLAINED
ABOVE
THIS
PUTS
BELIEF
DOWN
TO
A
MATTER
OF
EXPERIENCE
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
CHRISTIANS
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
MONOPOLY
ON
REASON
EVIDENCE
AND
FAITH
AS
FAR
AS
ANY
OF
THESE
THINGS
CAN
GO
IN
A
PREVIOUS
ARTICLE
SAYS
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
THAT
SCIENCE
AND
REASON
CANNOT
PROVE
ANYTHING
HOWEVER
IF
WE
DO
NOT
USE
THEM
WE
CAN
ONLY
THEN
BELIEVE
ON
FAITH
ALONE
AND
SINCE
WE
CAN
ONLY
USE
FAITH
WHY
IS
ONE
PICTURE
OF
GOD
EG
HINDUISM
ANY
LESS
VALID
THAN
ANOTHER
EG
CHRISTIANITY
FAITH
AS
I
HAVE
SAID
IS
NOT
OPPOSED
TO
REASON
IT
IS
SIMPLY
A
NEW
SOURCE
OF
EVIDENCE
ON
WHICH
REASON
MAY
OPERATE
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
HUMAN
BEINGS
HAVE
MANY
SYSTEMS
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
SENSES
AND
SIMILARLY
THERE
ARE
MANY
SYSTEMS
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
EVIDENCE
PROVIDED
BY
FAITH
RELIGIOUS
BELIEVERS
IN
GENERAL
AND
CHRISTIANS
IN
PARTICULAR
USE
REASON
TO
HELP
SIFT
THROUGH
THE
EVIDENCE
TO
COME
TO
A
CLEARER
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
EVIDENCE
PROVIDED
BY
FAITH
SCIENCE
CLAIMS
WITH
GOOD
REASON
TO
BE
THE
MOST
VALID
SYSTEM
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
PHYSICAL
UNIVERSE
AND
CHRISTIANITY
CLAIMS
ALSO
WITH
GOOD
REASON
TO
BE
THE
MOST
VALID
SYSTEM
POSSESSED
OF
THE
BEST
EVIDENCE
FOR
EXPLAINING
GODS
REVELATIONS
OF
HIMSELF
TO
MAN
AT
THE
RISK
OF
REPEATING
MY
ARGUMENT
AS
I
HAVE
EXPLAINED
PREVIOUSLY
THE
TROUBLE
IS
THAT
MOSLEMS
BUDDHISTS
JEWS
ETC
WILL
ALL
SAY
THAT
THEY
CLAIM
WITH
GOOD
REASON
TO
BE
A
VALID
SYSTEM
POSSESSED
OF
THE
BEST
EVIDENCE
FOR
EXPLAINING
GODS
REVELATIONS
TO
MAN
FOR
BUDDHISTS
IT
SHOULD
READ
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
NONEXISTENCE
OF
GOD
SO
NOT
ONLY
MUST
YOU
PROVE
YOUR
OWN
CASE
YOU
HAVE
TO
DISPROVE
THEIRS
ALTMESSIANIC
IS
A
GOOD
PLACE
TO
SEE
PEOPLE
STRONG
IN
THE
BELIEF
OF
THEIR
OWN
FAITHS
AND
WITH
THEIR
OWN
GOOD
REASONS
IF
YOU
DOUBT
THAT
CHRISTIANS
USE
REASON
READ
THIS
NEWSGROUP
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
YOU
WILL
SEE
RATIONAL
DEBATE
APLENTY
I
KNOW
THAT
ALL
PEOPLE
CAN
USE
REASON
I
NEVER
CLAIMED
THAT
THEY
DONT
I
JUST
WISH
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THEIR
ARGUMENTS
ARE
WELLFOUNDED
IT
GOES
WITHOUT
SAYING
THAT
IF
I
MAKE
A
BLUNDER
THAT
I
EXPECT
PEOPLE
TO
CORRECT
ME
ONCE
WE
HAVE
ALL
GONE
THROUGH
THIS
PROCESS
OF
REMOVING
THE
NONESSENTIAL
AND
CONTRADICTORY
BITS
WE
SHOULD
HOPEFULLY
HAVE
MADE
SOME
PROGRESS
TOWARDS
THE
TRUTH
MARK
BAKER
THE
TASK
IS
NOT
TO
CUT
DOWN
JUNGLES
BUT
TO
IRRIGATE
DESERTS
