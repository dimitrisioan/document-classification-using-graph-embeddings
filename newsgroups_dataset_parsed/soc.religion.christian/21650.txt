the
crowd
before
pilate
in
a
post
of
april
considering
disasters
as
instances
of
the
judgements
of
god
in
history
andy
byler
spoke
of
the
desire
of
the
jerusalem
mob
who
crucified
the
lord
that
his
blood
be
upon
us

replied
may
i
will
not
comment
here
for
fear
of
being
heavily
flamed
i
invite
them
both
and
other
interested
parties
as
well
to
read
my
comments
on
this
verse
of
scripture
to
obtain
them
send
the
message
get
choosing
barabbas
to
listservasuacadbitnet
or
to
listservasuvminreasuedu
putting
it
briefly
i
think
that
the
significance
of
the
demands
of
the
jerusalem
crowd
has
usually
been
greatly
misunderstood
both
by
christian
and
by
antichristian
readers
yours
james
kiefer
you
should
send
email
to
that
address
with
the
contents
of
the
message
being
a
single
line
containing
the
get
command
the
subject
line
is
apparently
ignored
at
least
