RE
EASTER
WHATS
IN
A
NAME
WAS
RE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DOUBLE
STAN
SEANNABNRCA
SEANNA
SM
WATSON
ASKS
WHAT
IS
THE
OBJECTION
TO
CELEBRATION
OF
EASTER
THE
OBJECTION
NATURALLY
IS
IN
THE
WAY
IN
WHICH
YOU
PHRASE
IT
EASTER
OR
EASHTAR
OR
ISHTAR
OR
ISHTARTI
OR
OTHER
SPELLINGS
IS
THE
PAGAN
WHORE
GODDESS
OF
FERTILITY
THEREFORE
YOUR
QUESTION
TO
ME
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
OBJECTION
TO
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
PAGAN
WHORE
GODDESS
WHEN
PHRASED
THAT
WAY
I
SUSPECT
OR
AT
LEAST
I
WOULD
HOPE
THAT
IT
BECOMES
IMMEADIATELY
APPARENT
WHAT
MY
OBJECTION
TO
CELEBRATING
HER
WOULD
BE
IT
IS
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
JESUS
NO
YOU
ARE
THINKING
PERHAPS
OF
RESSURECTION
SUNDAY
I
THINK
THOUGH
IM
NOT
TOO
CRAZY
ABOUT
THE
WORD
SUNDAY
BUT
I
CERTAINLY
LIKE
THIS
PHRASING
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
ENVOKING
THE
NAME
OF
THE
WHORE
GODDESS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
STAY
BIBLICAL
AND
CALL
IT
OMAR
RASHEET
THE
FEAST
OF
FIRST
FRUITS
TORAH
COMMANDS
THAT
THIS
BE
OBSERVED
ON
THE
DAY
FOLLOWING
THE
SABBATH
OF
PASSOVER
WEEK
SUNDAY
BY
ANY
OTHER
NAME
IN
MODERN
PARLANCE
WHY
IS
THERE
SO
MUCH
OBJECTION
TO
OBSERVING
THE
RESURRECTION
ON
THE
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
ON
WHICH
IT
ACTUALLY
OCCURED
WHY
JUMP
IT
ALL
OVER
THE
CALENDAR
THE
WAY
EASTER
DOES
WHY
NOT
JUST
GO
WITH
THE
SUNDAY
FOLLOWING
PASSOVER
THE
WAY
THE
BIBLE
HAS
IT
WHY
SEEK
AFTER
UNBIBLICAL
METHODS
I
DONT
RECALL
A
COMMAND
IN
SCRIPTURE
FOR
US
TO
CELEBRATE
THE
RESURRECTION
BUT
IT
IS
THE
SOLE
AND
ONLY
REASON
THAT
WE
ARE
CHRISTIANSHOW
COULD
WE
NOT
CELEBRATE
IT
SO
WHAT
DOES
THIS
QUESTION
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
EASTER
THE
WHORE
GODDESS
I
AM
ALL
FOR
CELEBRATING
THE
RESURRECTION
JUST
KEEP
THAT
WHORE
OUT
OF
THE
DISCUSSION
IF
IT
IS
ONLY
THE
NAME
WHICH
IS
A
PROBLEM
I
SUGGEST
THAT
IF
WE
ARE
TOO
CONCERNED
ABOUT
ETYMOLOGY
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
WORDS
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
DROP
AS
AN
ASIDE
SOME
TERMINALLY
PC
PEOPLE
HERE
IN
OTTAWA
WANT
DICTIONARIES
TO
BE
ALTERED
SO
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
NEGATIVE
DEFINITIONS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
WORD
BLACK
SO
AS
NOT
TO
OFFEND
PEOPLE
OF
COLOUR
YES
I
HAVE
HEARD
OF
YOUR
NEWSPAPERS
SPEAKING
OF
THE
NEED
TO
REPAVE
STREETS
WITH
AFROCANADIANTOP
GRIN
I
STILL
THINK
BLACKTOP
SOUNDS
BETTER
THOUGH
AS
A
SHORT
PERSON
I
HOPE
THEY
WILL
ALSO
REMOVE
THE
DEFINITION
CURT
OR
SURLY
ASSOCIATED
WITH
MY
PHYSICAL
DESCRIPTION
FINE
BY
ME
AND
WHILE
WE
ARE
AT
IT
THE
LEFTHANDED
PEOPLE
ARE
BOTH
SINISTER
AND
GAUCHE
SO
WE
PROBABLY
WILL
HAVE
SOME
OBJECTIONS
FROM
THAT
QUARTER
AS
WELL
IN
QUEBEC
FRENCH
THE
WORD
FOR
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
IS
PAQUESTHIS
IS
ETYMOLOGICALLY
RELATED
TO
PESACH
PASSOVER
AND
THE
PASCAL
LAMB
SO
IS
THE
FRENCH
CANADIAN
MOSTLY
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CELEBRATION
BETTER
BECAUSE
IT
USES
THE
RIGHT
NAME
YES
THAT
SOUNDS
MUCH
BETTER
TO
ME
IS
THERE
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
WOULD
THINKS
THAT
PHRASING
SOUNDS
WORSE
SO
FROM
THIS
I
INFER
THAT
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENT
RULES
FOR
CHRISTIANS
OF
JEWISH
DESCENT
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
THERE
IS
NEITHER
JEW
NOR
GREEK
SLAVE
NOR
FREE
MALE
NOR
FEMALE
FOR
ALL
ARE
ONE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
READ
THE
LETTER
TO
PHILEMON
NOW
TELL
ME
WAS
PHILEMONS
SLAVE
RETURNED
TO
HIM
WERE
THERE
DIFFERENT
RULES
UPON
THE
SLAVE
THAN
UPON
PHILEMON
HOW
ABOUT
MALE
AND
FEMALE
ARE
THERE
DIFFERENT
RULES
THAT
APPLY
TO
THEM
AS
WELL
OR
IF
THERE
IS
NO
MORE
MALE
AND
FEMALE
CAN
ADAM
AND
STEVE
GET
MARRIED
TO
EACH
OTHER
IN
YOUR
CONGREGATION
YES
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENCES
IN
FORM
AND
FUNCTION
BUT
THE
WAY
WE
COME
TO
SALVATION
IN
MESSIAH
REMAINS
THE
SAME
NO
MATTER
WHAT
OUR
POSITION
IN
LIFE
I
AM
IN
GENERAL
NOT
IN
FAVOR
OF
CONTINUING
THIS
DISCUSSION
AS
IT
SEEMS
REPETITIVE
BUT
THIS
PARTICULAR
POINT
IS
ONE
THAT
I
BELIEVE
IS
NEW
THE
OBJECTION
IS
NOT
TO
HAVING
A
HOLIDAY
BUT
TO
ITS
NAME
ID
LIKE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
PEOPLE
THINK
VERY
CAREFULLY
ABOUT
THIS
ARGUMENT
WORDS
OFTEN
CHANGE
THEIR
MEANING
OVER
TIME
THE
DAYS
OF
THE
WEEK
ARE
OF
COURSE
ORIGINALLY
BASED
ON
PAGAN
GODS
SOME
CHRISTIANS
PREFER
TO
REFER
TO
FIRST
DAY
SECOND
DAY
ETC
HOWEVER
THE
MAJORITY
OF
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
PERSUADED
THE
QUESTION
SEEMS
TO
BE
WHETHER
IT
MAKES
ANY
DIFFERENCE
WHAT
THE
DICTIONARY
SHOWS
AS
THE
DERIVATION
OF
A
WORD
IF
WHAT
PEOPLE
MEAN
BY
IT
AND
THINK
WHEN
THEY
USE
IT
IS
DIFFERENT
INDEED
ID
LIKE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
POSTINGS
LIKE
THIS
COULD
THEMSELVES
BE
DANGEROUS
SUPPOSE
PEOPLE
IN
GENERAL
USE
EASTER
TO
MEAN
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
CHRISTS
RESURRECTION
POSTINGS
TRYING
TO
CONVINCE
THEM
THAT
THEY
REALLY
MEAN
A
CELEBRATION
IN
HONOR
OF
SOME
GODESS
RUN
THE
RISK
OF
CREATING
EXACTLY
THE
SITUATION
THAT
THEY
CLAIM
TO
OPPOSE
THEY
ARE
DOING
THEIR
BEST
TO
CREATE
A
LINKAGE
IN
PEOPLES
MINDS
BETWEEN
THEIR
CELEBRATION
AND
THE
PAGAN
GODDESS
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
THAT
THIS
IS
A
HEALTHY
THING
