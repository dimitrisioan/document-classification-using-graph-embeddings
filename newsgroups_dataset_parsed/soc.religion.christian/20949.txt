we
know
that
in
everything
god
works
for
good
with
those
who
love
him
who
are
called
according
to
his
purpose
murphys
law
if
anything
can
go
wrong
it
will
we
are
all
quite
familiar
with
the
amplifications
and
commentary
on
murphys
law
but
how
do
we
harmonize
that
with
romans
for
that
matter
how
appropriate
is
humor
contradicted
by
scripture
both
christians
and
nonchristians
laugh
at
this
quote
because
it
exaggerates
something
we
all
feel
but
know
is
not
true
us
christians
just
know
that
a
little
better
in
god
we
trust
