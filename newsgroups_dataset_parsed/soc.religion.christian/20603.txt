there
any
former
atheists
here
who
were
led
to
christianity
by
argument
this
is
an
excellent
question
and
ill
be
anxious
to
see
if
there
are
any
such
cases
i
doubt
it

the
medieval
period
esp
when
aquinas
flourished
argument
was
a
useful
tool
because
everyone
knew
the
rules
today
when
you
cant
count
on
people
knowing
even

basics
of
logic
or
seeing
through
rhetoric
a
good
argument
is
often
indistinguishable
