atheists
and
hell
hello
i
have
seen
two
common
threads
running
through
postings
by
atheists
on
the
newsgroup
and
i
think
that
they
can
be
used
to
explain
each
other
unfortunately
i
dont
have
direct
quotes
handy
atheists
believe
that
when
they
die
they
die
forever
a
god
who
would
condemn
those
who
fail
to
believe
in
him
to
eternal
death
is
unfair
i
dont
see
what
the
problem
is
to
christians
hell
is
by
definition
eternal
deathexactly
what
atheists
are
expecting
when
they
die
theres
no
reason
hell
has
to
be
especially
awfulto
most
people
eternal
death
is
bad
enough
literal
interpreters
of
the
bible
will
have
a
problem
with
this
view
since
the
bible
talks
about
the
fires
of
hell
and
such
personally
i
dont
think
that
people
in
hell
will
be
thrust
into
flame
any
more
than
i
expect
to
jesus
with
a
doubleedged
sword
issuing
from
his
mouthi
treat
both
these
statements
as
metaphorical
alan
