RE
WHEN
ARE
TWO
PEOPLE
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
ROBERT
ANDERSON
WROTE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
YOUR
OPINIONS
ON
THIS
WHEN
EXACTLY
DOES
AN
ENGAGED
COUPLE
BECOME
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
SOME
SAY
THAT
IF
THE
TWO
HAVE
PUBLICALLY
ANNOUNCED
THEIR
PLANS
TO
MARRY
HAVE
MADE
THEIR
VOWS
TO
GOD
AND
ARE
UNSWERVINGLY
COMMITTED
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
I
REALIZE
THIS
IS
A
SUBJECTIVE
QUALIFIER
THEY
ARE
MARRIEDJOINED
IN
GODS
SIGHT
THE
WAY
I
READ
SCRIPTURE
A
COUPLE
BECOMES
MARRIED
WHEN
THEY
ARE
PHYSICALLY
MARRIED
IE
WHEN
THEY
FIRST
HAVE
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
EG
THE
END
OF
GENESIS
QUOTED
FROM
MEMORY
FOR
THIS
REASON
A
MAN
SHALL
LEAVE
HIS
PARENTS
AND
BE
JOINED
TO
HIS
WIFE
AND
THEY
WILL
BECOME
ONE
FLESH
JESUS
ALSO
QUOTES
THIS
SCRIPTURE
REFERRING
TO
MARRIAGE
IF
YOU
READ
THROUGH
GENESIS
IN
PARTICULAR
YOU
WILL
OFTEN
COME
ACROSS
THE
PHRASEOLOGY
MAN
LAY
WITH
WOMAN
AND
SHE
BECAME
HIS
WIFE
THIS
IMPLIES
THAT
SHE
BECAME
HIS
WIFE
WHEN
THEY
LAY
TOGETHER
IE
AT
THE
POINT
OF
INTERCOURSE
COMPARE
THIS
WITH
JEWISH
TRADITION
JOSEPH
WHEN
HE
HEARD
THAT
MARY
WAS
PREGNANT
HAD
IT
IN
MIND
TO
DIVORCE
HER
QUIETLY
BUT
MARY
AND
JOSEPH
WERE
BETROTHED
NOT
MARRIED
IE
THEY
WERE
IN
A
BINDING
RELATIONSHIP
WHICH
REQUIRED
A
DIVORCE
TO
GET
OUT
OF
BUT
MARRIAGE
WOULD
NOT
OCCUR
UNTIL
MARY
AND
JOSEPH
WENT
TO
BED
TOGETHER
COMPARE
WITH
CHRIST
AND
THE
CHURCH
EPHESIANS
REVELATION
THE
CHURCH
IS
DESCRIBED
AS
THE
BRIDE
OF
CHRIST
BUT
THE
MARRIAGE
OF
THE
LAMB
TAKES
PLACE
WHEN
JESUS
RETURNS
IE
WE
ARE
IN
A
BINDING
LOVERELATIONSHIP
WITH
JESUS
BUT
WE
ARE
STILL
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
THE
TIME
WHEN
THE
MARRIAGE
WILL
TAKE
PLACE
I
SEE
THIS
AS
THE
SPIRITUAL
EQUIVALENT
OF
SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
BECAUSE
IT
REPRESENTS
THE
MOST
INTIMATE
FELLOWSHIP
POSSIBLE
BETWEEN
MAN
AND
GOD
IN
SUMMARY
ENGAGEMENT
SHOULD
BE
HONOURED
AS
A
BINDING
RELATIONSHIP
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
MARRIAGE
A
CIVIL
CEREMONY
IS
NOT
MARRIAGE
EITHER
MARRIAGE
OCCURS
AT
THE
POINT
WHEN
THE
BETROTHED
COUPLE
GO
TO
BED
TOGETHER
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
DEMEAN
THE
CIVIL
OR
CHURCH
CEREMONY
OURS
WAS
GREAT
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
BE
TOO
PEDANTIC
HISTORICALLY
I
THINK
I
AM
CORRECT
IN
STATING
THAT
THE
CIVIL
CEREMONY
IE
A
MARRIAGE
RECOGNISED
BY
THE
STATE
HAS
ONLY
BEEN
AROUND
IN
THE
WEST
SINCE
NAPOLEON
WHO
INTRODUCED
IT
TO
KEEP
TABS
ON
THE
PEOPLE
ALTHOUGH
IM
READY
TO
BE
CORRECTED
ON
THAT
POINT
THIS
VIEW
OBVIOUSLY
RAISES
SOME
QUESTIONS
WHAT
ABOUT
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
HAD
SEX
WITH
ONE
OR
MORE
PARTNERS
WITHOUT
CONSIDERING
MARRIAGE
ARE
THOSE
PEOPLE
ALSO
MARRIED
IF
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
MARRIAGE
OCCURS
AT
THE
POINT
OF
INTERCOURSE
IS
IT
NECESSARY
TO
BE
MARRIED
IN
THE
EYES
OF
THE
STATE
I
WOULD
SAY
YES
BECAUSE
THIS
HONOURS
THE
LAWS
OF
OUR
NATIONS
IN
THE
WEST
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
NOT
ILLEGAL
TO
SLEEP
TOGETHER
THOUGH
UNMARRIED
IN
MOST
WESTERN
COUNTRIES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
GOD
HONOURING
TO
PROCLAIM
OUR
MARRIAGE
TO
THE
STATE
AND
TO
OUR
FRIENDS
BEFORE
ACTUALLY
CONSUMMATING
OUR
MARRIAGE
ITS
TO
DO
WITH
OUR
BEING
SALT
AND
LIGHT
AND
ALSO
TO
DO
WITH
HOW
PEOPLE
WILL
PERCEIVE
US
IE
IT
IS
CULTURALLY
INSENSITIVE
TO
DECLARE
YOURSELF
MARRIED
WITHOUT
GOING
THROUGH
A
CIVIL
CEREMONY

DAVIS

HAST
THOU
SLAIN
THE
JABBERWOCK

ARMS
