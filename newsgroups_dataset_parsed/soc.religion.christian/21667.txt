SCOTTPRISMGATECHEDU
SCOTT
HOLT
WRITES
HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNERIVE
HEARD
THAT
QUITE
A
BIT
RECENTLY
OFTEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
THE
CONTEXT
REALLY
ISNT
THAT
IMPORTANT
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
THAT
STATEMENT
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
THINK
NOT
HATE
BEGETS
MORE
HATE
NEVER
LOVE
CONSIDER
SOME
SIN
ILL
LEAVE
IT
UNNAMED
SINCE
I
DONT
WANT
THIS
TO
DIGRESS
INTO
AN
ARGUMENT
AS
TO
WHETHER
OR
NOT
SOMETHING
IS
A
SIN
NOW
LETS
APPLY
OUR
HATE
THE
SIN
PHILOSOPHY
AND
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
WE
TRULY
HATE
THE
SIN
THEN
THE
MORE
WE
SEE
IT
THE
STRONGER
OUR
HATRED
OF
IT
WILL
BECOME
EVENTUALLY
THIS
HATE
BECOMES
SO
STRONG
THAT
WE
BECOME
DISGUSTED
WITH
THE
SINNER
AND
EVENTUALLY
COME
TO
HATE
THE
SINNER
IN
ADDITION
OUR
HATRED
OF
THE
SIN
OFTEN
CAUSES
US
TO
SAY
AND
THAT
IS
AN
ASSUMPTION
ON
YOUR
PART
WHERE
IS
YOUR
PROOF
THAT
ONE
ALWAYS
WILL
DEGENERATE
INTO
HATING
THE
SINNER
BECAUSE
HE
HATES
THE
SIN
I
AM
REMINDED
OF
THE
CIVIL
RIGHTS
MOVEMENT
IN
AMERICA
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
MANY
INDIVIDUALS
HATED
THE
PROPONENTS
OF
RACISM
IT
IS
ALSO
TRUE
THAT
MANY
INDIVIDUALS
HATED
SEGREGATION
AND
DISCRIMINATION
WITH
THEIR
WHOLE
HEART
AND
NEVER
DEGENERATED
INTO
HATING
THE
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
PRACTICED
IT
DR
KINGS
MESSAGE
WAS
THIS
LOVE
THE
INDIVIDUAL
THE
LOVING
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
WOULD
TRANSFORM
HIM
INTO
A
FRIEND
HOWEVER
THIS
DID
NOT
TAKE
AWAY
HIS
HATRED
FOR
SEGREGATION
HIS
HATRED
FOR
INJUSTICE
IN
THE
SUMMARY
OF
THE
LAW
CHRIST
COMMANDS
US
TO
LOVE
GOD
AND
TO
LOVE
OUR
NEIGHBORS
HE
DOESNT
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HATE
IN
FACT
IF
ANYTHING
HE
COMMANDS
US
TO
SAVE
OUR
CRITICISMS
FOR
OURSELVES
SO
HOW
ARE
CHRISTIANS
SUPPOSED
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
SIN
OF
OTHERS
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
SIN
EITHER
IN
OTHERS
OR
OURSELVESTHROUGH
PRAYER
WE
NEED
TO
ASK
GOD
TO
HELP
US
WITH
OUR
OWN
SIN
AND
TO
HELP
THOSE
WE
LOVE
WITH
THEIRS
ONLY
LOVE
CAN
CONQUER
SINHATRED
HAS
NO
PLACE
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
LOVE
SOMEONE
IS
TO
PRAY
FOR
THEM
I
WOULD
ASK
DID
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
PRACTICE
LOVE
WHEN
HE
CRITICIZED
THE
JEWISH
LEADERS
OF
HIS
DAY
DID
JESUS
PRACTICE
LOVE
WHEN
HE
THREW
THE
MONEYCHANGERS
OUT
OF
THE
TEMPLE
WE
MUST
HAVE
AT
LEAST
A
DISTASE
FOR
SIN
WE
MUST
IN
ORDER
TO
FIGHT
IT
IN
OURSELVES
ALSO
WE
MUST
BE
READY
FOR
THE
CALL
FROM
GOD
TO
CALL
SIN
BY
ITS
RIGHT
NAME
JESUS
LOVED
EVERYONE
BUT
HE
CALLED
SIN
BY
ITS
RIGHT
NAME
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
LOVE
FOR
OTHERS
IS
TO
GUIDE
EVERY
STEP
OF
OUR
WALK
BUT
IT
IS
ALSO
TRUE
THAT
SOMETIMES
THE
LOVE
FOR
GOD
CALLS
US
TO
STAND
UP
FOR
TRUTH
COMPETITION
IS
THE
LAW
OF
THE
JUNGLE
COOPERATION
IS
THE
LAW
OF
CIVILIZATION
