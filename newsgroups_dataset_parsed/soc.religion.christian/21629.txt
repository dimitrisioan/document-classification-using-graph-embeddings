HATE
THE
SIN
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNERIVE
HEARD
THAT
QUITE
A
BIT
RECENTLY
OFTEN
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
AND
HOMOSEXUALITY
BUT
THE
CONTEXT
REALLY
ISNT
THAT
IMPORTANT
MY
QUESTION

CONSISTENT
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
I
WOULD
THINK

GRATEFUL
FOR

PHRASE
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
REMIND
ME
OF
THE
SCRIPTURAL
SOURCE
FOR
IT
ROM
DOESNT
COUNT
KIDS
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
THIS
LITTLE
PIECE
OF
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
IS
