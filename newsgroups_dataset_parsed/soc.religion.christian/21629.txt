heard
that
quite
a
bit
recently
often
in
the
context
of
discussions
about
christianity
and
homosexuality

that
statement
is
consistent

on
this
oftquoted
phrase
could
someone
please
remind
me
of
the
scriptural
source
for
it
rom

count
kids
the
manner
in
which
this
little
piece
of
conventional
wisdom
is
applied
has
in

been
