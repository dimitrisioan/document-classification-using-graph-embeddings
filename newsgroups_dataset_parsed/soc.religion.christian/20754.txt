i
would
like
to
get
your
opinions
on
this
when
exactly
does
an
engaged
couple
become
married
in
gods
eyes
not
if
they
are
unwilling
to
go
through
a
public
marriage
ceremony
nor
if
they
say
they
are
willing
but
have
not
actually
done
so
lets
distinguish
real
logistical
problems
like
being
stranded
on
a
desert
island
from
excuses
such
as
waiting
for
soandsos
brother
to
come
back
from
being
in
the
army
so
he
can
be
in
the
ceremony
