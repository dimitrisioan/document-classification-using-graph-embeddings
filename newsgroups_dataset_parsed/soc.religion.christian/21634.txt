RE
DEFINITION
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IN
ARTICLE
CLH
WRITES
OFTEN
WE
GET
INTO
DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT
WHO
IS
CHRISTIAN
UNFORTUNATELY
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
POSSIBLE
DEFINITIONS
STARTING
FROM
THE
BROADEST
COMMONLY
USED
DEFINITIONS
ARE
THE
NEXT
LEVEL
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
GIVE
A
BROAD
DOCTRINAL
DEFINITION
WHICH
INCLUDES
ALL
OF
THE
MAJOR
STRANDS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
BUT
EXCLUDES
GROUPS
THAT
ARE
FELT
TO
BE
OUTSIDE
HISTORIC
CHRISTIANITY
THIS
IS
OF
COURSE
A
SLIPPERY
ENTERPRISE
SINCE
CATHOLICS
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
PROTESTANTS
ARE
OUTSIDE
HISTORIC
CHRISTIANITY
ETC
BUT
I
THINK
THE
MOST
COMMONLY
ACCEPTED
DEFINITION
WOULD
BE
BASED
ON
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
NICENE
CREED
AND
THE
FORMULA
OF
CHALCEDON
ARE
YOU
SURE
YOU
WANT
TO
INCLUDE
CHALCEDON
HERE
I
PRESUME
THAT
YOU
MEAN
THE
DESCRIPTION
OF
JESUS
AS
FULLY
HUMAN
AND
FULLY
DEVINE
ALMOST
EVERYONE
WOULD
CONSIDER
THE
MAJORITY
OF
COPTS
AND
ARMENIANS
AND
THE
JACOBITES
AS
CHRISTIANS
YET
FOR
CENTURIES
IT
HAS
BEEN
MAINTAINED
THAT
THEY
DISAGREE
WITH
THE
FORMULA
OF
CHALCEDON
THOSE
THAT
WOULDNT
CONSIDER
THEM
CHRISTIANS
ARE
MOST
LIKELY
TO
OBJECT
THAT
THESE
COMMUNITIES
DONT
REQUIRE
A
PERSONAL
COMMITMENT
TO
JESUS
WHICH
IS
ONLY
TANGENTIALLY
RELATED
TO
THE
FORMULA
OF
CHALCEDON
THANKS
JOHN
KOLASSA
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
HERE
THE
COPTS
FOR
ALL
PRACTICAL
PURPOSES
ACCEPT
CHALCEDON
THEY
TALK
ABOUT
ONE
NATURE
RATHER
THAN
TWO
BUT
THE
ISSUE
SEEMS
TO
BE
ONE
OF
TERMINOLOGY
RATHER
THAN
SUBSTANCE
