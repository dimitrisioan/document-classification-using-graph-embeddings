WHEN
IS
A
COUPLE
MARRIED
I
USED
TO
BE
A
MARRIAGE
COMMISSIONER
FOR
THE
ALASKA
COURT
SYSTEM
SORT
OF
A
JUSTICE
OF
THE
PEACE
I
HAD
GREAT
DIFFICULTY
WITH
THAT
DUTY
I
USED
TO
PRAY
EARNESTLY
IN
THE
COURTHOUSE
BATHROOM
BEFORE
THE
CEREMONIES
MOSTLY
ASKING
THAT
THE
COUPLES
WOULD
COME
TO
APPRECIATE
AND
FULFILL
THE
TRUE
HOLINESS
AND
DIVINE
PURPOSE
IN
MARRIAGECOUPLES
WHO
OBVIOUSLY
DIDNT
REALIZE
THAT
MARRIAGE
IS
GODS
INSTITUTION
NOT
THE
STATES
GRADUALLY
HOWEVER
I
CAME
TO
CONCLUDE
THAT
BECAUSE
I
WAS
ACTING
IN
A
STRICTLY
SECULAR
PUBLIC
CAPACITY
ESTABLISHED
AS
SUCH
BY
BOTH
THE
STATE
AND
THE
EXPECTATIONS
OF
THE
COUPLES
INVOLVED
I
WAS
REALLY
CONDUCTING
A
PURELY
SECULAR
LEGAL
CIVIL
EVENT
WITH
NO
GREATER
MORAL
OR
RELIGIOUS
IMPLICATIONS
THAN
IF
I
HAD
BEEN
CONDUCTING
A
CIVIL
TRIAL
THE
COUPLE
WHO
TOLD
ME
MIDCEREMONY
TO
PLEASE
HURRY
IT
UP
MAY
HAVE
HELPED
ME
TO
THIS
CONCLUSION
I
THOUGHT
I
HAD
NEATLY
RATIONALIZED
A
CLEAR
AND
SHARP
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
MARRIAGE
BEFORE
GOD
AND
MARRIAGE
BEFORE
THE
STATE
UNTIL
I
HAD
TO
DEAL
WITH
MY
OWN
DIVORCE
KEEPING
MATTHEW
IN
MIND
I
FELT
THAT
THE
STATE
HAD
NO
BUSINESS
DISSOLVING
MY
MARRIAGE
ESTABLISHED
BEFORE
GOD
BUT
OF
COURSE
IT
ASSUMED
JURISDICTION
NONETHELESS
I
WOULD
ASK
THOSE
OF
YOU
PROPOSING
ANSWERS
TO
THIS
QUESTION
TO
CONSIDER
THIS
ISSUES
LOGICAL
EXTENSION
IF
INTERCOURSE
OR
THE
MENTAL
INTENT
OF
THE
PARTIES
OR
THE
CEREMONY
OF
THE
CHURCH
OR
ANY
COMBINATION
THEREOF
ESTABLISHES
MARRIAGE
THEN
AT
WHAT
MOMENT
IS
IT
DISSOLVED
