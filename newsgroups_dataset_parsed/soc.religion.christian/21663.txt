CHRISTIANITY
AND
HOLY
THINGS
EZEK
GOD
SEEMS
TO
BE
UPSET
WITH
THE
PRIESTS
WHO
HAVE
MADE
NO
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
HOLY
AND
THE
PROFANE
THIS
BROUGHT
TO
MY
MIND
A
SERMON
I
HEARD
RECENTLY
IN
WHICH
THE
SPEAKER
SAID
GODS
SECOND
NAME
DOES
NOT
BEGIN
WITH
A
D
REFERRING
I
BELIEVE
TO
USE
OF
GODS
HOLY
NAME
AND
TITLES
AS
SWEAR
WORDS
I
WAS
ALSO
REMINDED
OF
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
MOSES
AT
THE
BURNING
BUSH
WHEN
GOD
TOLD
HIM
TAKE
OFF
YOUR
SANDALS
FOR
THE
PLACE
WHERE
YOU
ARE
STANDING
IS
HOLY
GROUND
THESE
AND
OTHER
TEXTS
SEEM
TO
IMPLY
THAT
GODS
PEOPLE
MUST
TREAT
HOLY
THINGS
DIFFERENTLY
FROM
OTHER
COMMON
THINGS
OR
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
HOLY
AND
COMMON
THINGS
THE
OBVIOUS
QUESTIONS
ARE
WHAT
MAKES
SOMETHING
HOLY
AND
HOW
ARE
CHRISTIANS
PRIMARILY
SUPPOSED
TO
MAKE
THIS
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
HOLY
AND
COMMON
THINGS
EG
GODS
NAME
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THE
HOLY
BIBLE
ETC
DARIUS
