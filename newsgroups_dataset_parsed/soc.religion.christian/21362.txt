ALTARIQ
WRITES
WHOS
LAW
IS
IT
THAT
A
WEDDING
HAS
TO
HAPPEN
IN
A
CHURCH
THE
ONLY
REQIREMENT
IS
THAT
YOU
AND
THE
BRIDE
AGREEE
TO
MARRY
EACH
OTHER
HOW
ALSO
CAN
YOU
SAY
CHRISTIAN
WEDDING
WHEN
THE
PROCES
OF
MARRIAGE
IS
NT
REALLY
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHY
MUS
T
A
PERSON
GET
A
CIVIL
MARRIAGE
ALSO
THE
ONLY
STANDARDS
I
LOOK
TO
ARE
THOSE
IMPOSED
UPON
ME
BY
GOD
NOT
OF
SOCIETY
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
LIVE
WITH
SOMEONE
YOU
CAN
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
HAVE
A
CIVIL
MARRIAGE
DONT
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
HAVE
A
WEDDING
IN
A
CHURCH
DONT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
CALL
THAT
A
MARRIAGE
GO
RIGHT
AHEAD
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
AROUND
YOU
DONT
FOLLOW
YOUR

IF
THE
ORIGINAL
MESSAGE
CLAIMS
THAT
MARRIAGE
IS
NOT
DISCUSSED
IN
THE
BIBLE
I
HAVE
TO
DISAGREE
VARIOUS
ASPECTS
OF
MARRIAGE
ARE
DISCUSSED
IN
SOME
OF
PAULS
LETTERS
EPHESIANS
SEES
MARRIAGE
AS
A
SYMBOL
OF
GODS
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE
CHURCH
IF
IT
MEANS
SPECIFICALLY
THAT
THE
MARRIAGE
CEREMONY
ISNT
DESCRIBED
THEN
THAT
SEEMS
TO
BE
TRUE
BUT
I
THINK
WHAT
MOST
PEOPLE
MEAN
BY
CHRISTIAN
MARRIAGE
IS
NOT
SO
MUCH
THAT
IT
TAKES
PLACE
IN
A
CHURCH
AS
THAT
THE
PARTIES
UNDERTAKE
THE
VARIOUS
COMMITMENTS
TO
EACH
OTHER
THAT
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
MARRIAGE
IN
THE
BIBLE
