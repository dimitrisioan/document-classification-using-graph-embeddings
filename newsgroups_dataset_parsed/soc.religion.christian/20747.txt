RE
SOME
QUESTIONS
FROM
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
OFM
RESPONDS
TO
A
QUERY
ABOUT
REFERENCE
WORKS
ASIDE
FROM
A
COMMENTARY
YOU
MIGHT
ALSO
WANT
TO
CONSIDER
AN
INTRODUCTION
THESE
ARE
BOOKS
INTENDED
FOR
USE
IN
UNDERGRADUATE
BIBLE
COURSES
THEY
GIVE
HISTORICAL
BACKGROUND
DISCUSSION
OF
LITERARY
STYLES
ETC
AND
GENERALLY
THEY
HAVE
GOOD
BIBLIGRAPHIES
FOR
FURTHER
READING
I
TYPICALLY
RECOMMEND
KEE
FROEHLICH
AND
YOUNGS
NT
INTRODUCTION
TWO
OTHER
INTROS
TO
CONSIDER
THE
INTRODUCTION
BY
KUMMEL
IS
A
TRANSLATION
OF
A
STRANDARD
NT
TEXT
THE
REFERENCES
ARE
SLIGHTLY
DATED
AND
THE
STYLE
IS
SOMEWHAT
DENSE
BUT
THE
BOOK
CONTAINS
A
WEALTH
OF
INFORMATION
PERRIN
AND
DULINGS
INTRO
IS
ALSO
VERY
GOOD
ITS
SOMEWHAT
MORE
MODERN
THAN
KUMMELS
BUT
NOT
QUITE
SO
DENSELY
PACKED
ALSO
THE
AUTHORS
TEND
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
BOOKS
OF
THE
NT
IN
THE
HISTORICAL
ORDER
OF
COMPOSITION
THIS
GIVES
A
VERY
USEFUL
PERSPECTIVE
ON
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
NT
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SOME
GOOD
ONEVOLUME
COMMENTARIES
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
RECOMMENDATION
THESE
DAYS
WOULD
BE
HARPERS
BIBLE
COMMENTARY
A
SLIGHT
DISSENT
I
THINK
THE
HARPERS
IS
OK
BUT
NOT
GREAT
ONE
PARTICULAR
PROBLEM
I
HAVE
IS
THAT
IT
TENDS
TO
BE
PRETTY
SKIMPY
ON
BIBLIOGRAPHIC
MATERIAL
MY
FEELING
IS
THAT
IT
IS
OK
FOR
QUICK
LOOKUPS
BUT
NOT
REAL
USEFUL
FOR
STUDY
IN
DEPTH
EG
I
KEEP
A
COPY
IN
MY
OFFICE
AT
WORK
I
THINK
THERE
MAY
BE
A
COUPLE
OF
BOOKS
WITH
THIS
TITLE
SO
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
BOOK
WITH
THIS
EXACT
TITLE
JAMES
L
MAYS
GENERAL
EDITOR
HARPER
AND
ROW
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
I
RECALL
A
OLDER
SERIES
UNDER
THE
NAME
HARPER
COMMENTARIES
ALSO
THERES
A
SEPARATE
HARPERS
BIBLE
DICTIONARY
MOST
OF
MY
COMMENTS
ON
THE
HC
ALSO
APPLY
TO
THE
HBD
MY
FAVORITE
ONEVOLUME
COMMENTARY
IS
THE
NEW
JEROME
BIBLICAL
COMMENTARY
THE
NJBC
IS
RATHER
CATHOLIC
IN
FOCUS
AND
SOMEWHAT
BIASED
TOWARDS
THE
NT
THE
READER
CAN
DECIDE
FOR
HER
OR
HIMSELF
WHETHER
THESE
ARE
PLUSES
OR
MINUSES
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
SCHOLARSHIP
IS
BY
AND
LARGE
EXCELLENT
NOTE
THE
NJBC
IS
A
COMPLETELY
REWORKED
UPDATED
VERSION
OF
THE
JEROME
BIBLICAL
COMMENTARY
COPIES
OF
WHICH
CAN
STILL
BE
FOUND
ON
SALE
