clarification
easter
in
response
to
a
lot
of
email
ive
gotten
i
need
to
clarify
my
position
i
am
not
in
favor
of
paganism
i
am
not
in
favor
of
the
easter
bunny
or
other
nonchristian
aspects
of
easter
as
presently
celebrated
incidentally
easter
eggs
are
not
nonchristian
they
are
a
way
of
ending
the
lenten
fast
my
point
was
to
distinguish
between
intentionally
worshipping
a
pagan
deity
and
doing
something
which
may
once
have
had
pagan
associations
but
nowadays
is
not
understood
or
intended
as
such
many
people
who
are
doing
are
being
accused
of
it
would
be
illogical
to
claim
that
one
is
really
worshipping
a
pagan
deity
without
knowing
it
worship
is
a
matter
of
intention
one
cannot
worship
without
knowing
that
one
is
doing
