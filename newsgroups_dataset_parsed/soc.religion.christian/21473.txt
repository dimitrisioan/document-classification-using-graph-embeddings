CLIFF
SLAUGHTERBECK
WRITES
ALONG
THE
WAY
SHE
WAS
MARRIED
HAPPILY
TO
A
WONDERFUL
AND
SUPPORTIVE
HUSBAND
AND
GAVE
BIRTH
TO
TWO
SONS
STILL
EVERYTHING
WAS
NOT
PERFECT
FOR
JANE
SINCE
SHE
COULD
NEVER
OPEN
UP
THE
DEEPEST
PART
OF
HER
SOUL
TO
HER
HUSBAND
ONE
OF
THE
INTERESTING
THINGS
THAT
JANE
SAID
IN
THIS
WHOLE
DISCUSSION
WAS
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
NOT
ABOUT
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
THE
BEDROOM
SHE
FOUND
THAT
SHE
WAS
MUCH
MORE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
A
DEEP
COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
A
WOMAN
THAN
A
MAN
SEX
IN
HER
MIND
IS
ONLY
A
PART
OF
THE
WHOLE
RELATIONSHIP
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
SHE
HAS
A
PROBLEM
SHE
HAS
A
PROBLEM
OPENING
UP
TO
HER
HUSBAND
SO
SHE
IS
LESBIAN
WHAT
IN
A
MARRIGE
A
COUPLE
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
OPEN
UP
TO
EACH
OTHER
BECAUSE
SHE
DIDNT
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
OPENING
UP
TO
HER
HUSBAND
SHE
GETS
A
DIVORCE
AND
COMES
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
SHE
IS
LESBIAN
BEFORE
ANYONE
GETS
MARIED
THEY
SHOULD
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
FEEL
COMFORTABLE
OPEN
UP
THE
DEEPEST
PART
OF
HER
SOUL
TO
HER
HUSBAND
SEX
IN
HER
MIND
IS
ONLY
A
PART
OF
THE
WHOLE
RELATIONSHIP
DID
SHE
THINK
IT
WAS
DIFFRENT
WITH
A
MAN
THAT
MIGHT
BE
HER
PROBLEM
IN
CHRISTS
LOVE
