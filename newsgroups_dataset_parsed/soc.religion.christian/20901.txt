WRITES
IN

SUPPOSE
YOU
WERE
PART
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
CONSIPRACY
WHICH
WAS
GOING
TO
TELL
PEOPLE
THAT
CHRIST
HAD
RISEN
NEVER
MIND
THE
STONING
THE
BEING
BURNED
ALIVE
THE
POSSIBLE
CRUCIFIXION
LETS
JUST
TALK
ABOUT
A
SCOURGING
THE
WHIP
THAT
WOULD
BE
USED
WOULD
HAVE
BROKEN
POTTERY
METAL
NO
ONE
WAS
EVER
FLOGGED
BEATEN
BURNED
FED
TO
THE
LIONS
OR
KILLED
IN
ANY
OTHER
WAY
BECAUSE
OF
A
BELIEF
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
SORRY
TO
DISAPPOINT
YOU
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
VASTLY
OVERSIMPLIFYING
THINGS
WE
KNOW
THAT
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
SUFFERED
TOTURES
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
WITNESS
TO
CHRIST
FOR
EXAMPLE
ACT
HIS
SPEECH
PERSUADED
THEM
THEY
CALLED
THE
APOSTLES
IN
AND
HAD
THEM
FLOGGED
THEN
THEY
ORDERED
THEM
NOT
TO
SPEAK
IN
THE
NAME
OF
JESUS
AND
LET
THEM
GO
ACT
THE
APOSTLES
LEFT
THE
SANHEDRIN
REJOICING
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
BEEN
COUNTED
WORTHY
OF
SUFFERING
DISGRACE
FOR
THE
NAME
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THE
JEWISH
RULERS
OF
THAT
TIME
HAD
A
PARTICULAR
AVERSION
TO
EVEN
HEARING
JESUSS
NAME
ACT
WE
GAVE
YOU
STRICT
ORDERS
NOT
TO
TEACH
IN
THIS
NAME
HE
SAID
YET
YOU
HAVE
FILLED
JERUSALEM
WITH
YOUR
TEACHING
AND
ARE
DETERMINED
TO
MAKE
US
GUILTY
OF
THIS
MANS
BLOOD
FINALLY
THE
FIRST
APOSTLES
DEATH
JAMES
OF
ZEBEDEE
WAS
CERTAINLY
NOT
BY
ROMES
HAND
ANY
MORE
THAN
THE
FIRST
MARTYR
STEPHEN
THE
IDEA
OF
RESURRECTION
IS
ONE
WHICH
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
A
HOST
OF
DIFFERENT
FORMS
IN
THE
RELIGIONS
OF
ANTIQUITY
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
NOT
THE
RESURRECTION
WHICH
WAS
A
MEDIORCE
ISSUE
FOR
A
TINY
FRAGMENT
OF
THE
JEWISH
POPULATION
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
IF
ONE
BELIEVED
IN
THE
RESURRECTION
THEN
ONE
MUST
BELIEVE
IN
JESUS
AS
TRULY
BEING
THE
SON
OF
GOD
AND
WHAT
HE
STOOD
FOR
AND
PREACHED
DURING
HIS
MINISTRY
ON
EARTH
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
FOR
SOME
PEOPLE
ESPECIALLY
THOSE
THAT
HAD
PLOTTED
TO
KILL
HIM
