RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
EUGENE
BIGELOW
WRITES
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
SAY
THAT
GOD
IS
A
FAIR
GOD
SIC
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
HOW
CAN
THIS
POSSIBLY
BE
FAIR
TO
THE
INFANTS
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
FAIR
GOD
IS
JUST
GIVING
TO
EVERYONE
WHAT
THEY
DESERVE
AS
ALL
INFANTS
ARE
IN
SIN
FROM
THE
TIME
OF
CONCEPTION
CF
ROMANS
PSALM
THEY
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
MERIT
HEAVEN
AND
AS
PURGATORY
IS
FOR
THE
PURGING
OF
TEMPORAL
PUNISHMENT
AND
VENIAL
SINS
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
THAT
ORIGIANL
SIN
CAN
BE
FORGIVEN
HENCE
THE
UNBAPTIZED
INFANTS
ARE
CUT
OFF
FROM
THE
GOD
AGAINST
WHOM
THEY
WITH
THE
WHOLE
OF
THE
HUMAN
RACE
EXCEPT
MARY
HAVE
SINNED
WHICH
IS
WHY
JESUS
SAID
TRULY
TRULY
I
SAY
TO
YOU
NO
ONE
CAN
ENTER
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
UNLESS
HE
IS
BORN
OF
WATER
AND
SPIRIT
WHICH
IS
THE
TRUE
MEANING
OF
BORN
AGAIN
JOHN
THUS
AS
INFANTS
ARE
IN
SIN
IT
IS
VERY
FAIR
FOR
THEM
TO
BE
CUT
OFF
FROM
GOD
AND
EXLCUDED
FROM
HEAVEN
AS
ST
AUGUSTINE
SAID
I
DID
NOT
INVENT
ORIGINAL
SIN
WHICH
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
HOLDS
FROM
ANCIENT
TIME
BUT
YOU
WHO
DENY
IT
WITHOUT
A
DOUBT
ARE
A
FOLLOWER
OF
A
NEW
HERESY
