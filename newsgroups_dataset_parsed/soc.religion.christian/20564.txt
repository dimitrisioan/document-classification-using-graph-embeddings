THIS
IS
A
REPLACEMENT
FOR
AN
EARLIER
MORE
CLUMSILY
WORDED
SUBMISSION
ON
THE
SAME
TOPIC
WHICH
I
SUBMITTED
A
FEW
MINUTES
AGO
I
THINK
WE
NEED
TO
DISTINGUISH
ETYMOLOGY
FROM
MEANING
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
THE
WORD
EASTER
ORIGINATED
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
IT
DOES
NOT
NOW
MEAN
ANYTHING
TO
CHRISTIANS
OTHER
THAN
THE
FEAST
DAY
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
THE
MEANING
OF
A
WORD
IS
ONLY
WHAT
PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND
IT
TO
MEAN
AND
THE
SAME
GOES
FOR
OTHER
CULTURAL
PRACTICES
THE
FESTIVAL
OF
EASTER
MAY
POSSIBLY
HAVE
SOME
HISTORICAL
ASSOCIATION
WITH
SOME
PAGAN
FESTIVAL
BUT
TODAY
THERE
ARE
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
NO
CHRISTIANS
WHO
INTEND
TO
HONOR
ANY
KIND
OF
PAGAN
GODDESS
BY
CELEBRATING
EASTER
IT
IS
NONSENSE
TO
SAY
THIS
WORD
OR
THIS
PRACTICE
REALLY
MEANS
SO
ANDSO
EVEN
THOUGH
NOBODY
REALIZES
IT
WORDS
AND
PRACTICES
DONT
MEAN
THINGS
PEOPLE
DO
THIS
IS
BASIC
SEMANTICS
IM
A
LINGUIST
THEY
PAY
ME
TO
THINK
ABOUT
THINGS

FURTHER
EASTER
IS
SPECIFIC
TO
ENGLISH
IN
MANY
OTHER
LANGUAGES
THE
WORD
USED
IS
BASED
ON
PASSOVER
OR
RESURRECTION
IS
IT
OK
TO
CELEBRATE
IT
IN
COUNTRIES
USING
THOSE
LANGUAGES
BUT
NOT
