RE
ANGER
PAUL
CONDITT
WRITES
IN
CASE
YOU
COULDNT
TELL
I
GET
EXTREMELY
ANGRY
AND
UPSET
WHEN
I
SEE
THINGS
LIKE
THIS
INSTEAD
OF
RATIONALIZING
OUR
OWN
FEARS
AND
PHOBIAS
WE
NEED
TO
BE
REACHING
OUT
TO
PEOPLE
WITH
AIDS
AND
OTHER
SOCIALLY
UNACCEPTABLE
DISEASES
WHETHER
THEY
GOT
THE
DISEASE
THROUGH
THEIR
OWN
ACTIONS
OR
NOT
IS
IRRELEVANT
THEY
STILL
NEED
JESUS
AARON
BRYCE
CARDENAS
WRITES
THE
FIRST
ISSUE
YOU
BRING
UP
IS
YOUR
ANGER
IT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
WRONG
TO
BE
ANGRY
GAL
FOR
ANY
REASON
ESPECIALLY
EXTREMELY
ANGRY
WHICH
IS
ON
PAR
WITH
HATRED
JESUS
HAS
EVERY
REASON
TO
BE
ANGRY
AT
US
FOR
PUTTING
HIM
ON
THE
CROSS
WITH
OUR
SIN
YET
HIS
PRAYER
WAS
FORGIVE
THEM
FATHER
THEY
KNOW
NOT
WHAT
THEY
DO
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
IT
IS
SO
OBVIOUS
WE
ARE
NOT
SPEAKING
OF
ACTS
OF
THE
FLESH
WE
ARE
JUST
SPEAKING
OF
EMOTIONS
EMOTIONS
ARE
NOT
OF
THEMSELVES
MORAL
OR
IMMORAL
GOOD
OR
BAD
EMOTIONS
JUST
ARE
THE
FIRST
STEP
IS
NOT
TO
LABEL
HIS
EMOTION
AS
GOOD
OR
BAD
OR
TO
NUMB
OURSELVES
SO
THAT
WE
HIDE
OUR
TRUE
FEELINGS
IT
IS
TO
ACCEPT
OURSELVES
AS
WE
ARE
AS
GOD
ACCEPTS
US
IT
SEEMS
THAT
PAULS
ANGER
HE
HAS
ACCEPTED
AND
CHANNELED
IT
TO
A
PLEA
TO
ALL
OF
US
TO
REFRAIN
FROM
PASSING
JUDGEMENT
ON
THOSE
AFFLICTED
WITH
A
DISEASE
AND
TO
REACH
OUT
TO
OTHERS
GIVE
IN
CALLING
HIS
ARGUMENTS
FOOLISH
BELITTLING
THEM
TO
ONLY
QUARRELS
AVOIDING
ACTION
BECAUSE
OF
FEAR
TO
GIVE
OTHERS
A
BAD
FEELING
HES
NOT
FORGIVING
RETHINK
IT
AARON
DONT
BE
QUICK
TO
JUDGE
HE
HAS
FORGIVEN
THOSE
WITH
AIDS
HE
HAS
DEALT
WITH
AND
TAKEN
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
HIS
FEELINGS
AND
MADE
APPROPRIATE
CHOICES
FOR
ACTION
ON
SUCH
FEELINGS
HE
HAS
NOT
GIVEN
IN
TO
HIS
ANGER
