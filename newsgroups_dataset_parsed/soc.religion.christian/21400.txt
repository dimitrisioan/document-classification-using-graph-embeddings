DAVID
WAGNER
WRITES
THE
DEUTEROCANONICAL
BOOKS
WERE
ADDED
MUCH
LATER
IN
THE
CHURCHS
HISTORY
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
SAME
SPIRITUAL
QUALITY
AS
THE
REST
OF
SCRIPTURE
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THE
CHURCH
THAT
ADDED
THESE
BOOKS
WAS
GUIDED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
IN
SO
DOING
AND
THAT
IS
WHERE
THIS
SORT
OF
DISCUSSION
ULTIMATELY
ENDS

WHAT
THAT
LAST
PARAGRAPH
JUST
ABOUT
KILLED
ME
THE
DEUTEROCANONICALS
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
ACCEPTED
AS
INSPIRED
SCRIPTURE
BY
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
WHICH
HAS
EXISTED
MUCH
LONGER
THAN
ANY
PROTESTANT
CHURCH
OUT
THERE
IT
WAS
MARTIN
LUTHER
WHO
BEGAN
HACKING
UP
THE
BIBLE
AND
DECIDING
TO
REMOVE
CERTAIN
BOOKSNOT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
DECIDED
TO
ADD
SOME
MUCH
LATERTHAT
IS
THE
REASON
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CATHOLIC
AND
PROTESTANT
BIBLES
SORRY
FOR
THE
TONEBUT
THAT
COMMENT
REALLY
IRKED
