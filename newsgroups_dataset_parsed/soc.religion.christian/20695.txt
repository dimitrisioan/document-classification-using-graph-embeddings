RE
ASSURANCE
OF
HELL
IN
ARTICLE

WRITES
I
DREAMED
THAT
THE
GREAT
JUDGMENT
MORNING
HAD
DAWNED
AND
THE
TRUMPET
HAD
BLOWN
I
DREAMED
THAT
THE
SINNERS
HAD
GATHERED
FOR
JUDGMENT
BEFORE
THE
WHITE
THRONE
OH
WHAT
WEEPING
AND
WAILING
AS
THE
LOST
WERE
TOLD
OF
THEIR
FATE
THEY
CRIED
FOR
THE
ROCK
AND
THE
MOUNTAINS
THEY
PRAYED
BUT
THEIR
PRAYERS
WERE
TOO
LATE
THE
SOUL
THAT
HAD
PUT
OFF
SALVATION
NOT
TONIGHT
ILL
GET
SAVED
BY
AND
BY
NO
TIME
NOW
TO
THINK
OF
RELIGION
ALAS
HE
HAD
FOUND
TIME
TO
DIE
AND
I
SAW
A
GREAT
WHITE
THRONE
IF
I
BELIEVED
IN
THE
GOD
OF
THE
BIBLE
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
FEARFUL
OF
MAKING
THIS
STATEMENT
DOESNT
IT
SAY
THOSE
WHO
JUDGE
WILL
BE
JUDGED
BY
THE
SAME
MEASURE
NOW
SOME
HAVE
PROTEST
BY
SAYING
THAT
THE
FEAR
OF
HELL
IS
NOT
GOOD
FOR
MOTIVATION
YET
JESUS
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
PAUL
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
PAUL
SAID
KNOWING
THEREFORE
THE
TERROR
OF
THE
LORD
WE
PERSUADE
MEN
A
GOD
WHO
MUST
MOTIVATE
THROUGH
FEAR
IS
NOT
A
GOD
WORTHY
OF
WORSHIP
IF
THE
GOD
JESUS
SPOKE
OF
DID
INDEED
EXIST
HE
WOULD
NOT
NEED
HELL
TO
CONVINCE
PEOPLE
TO
WORSHIP
HIM
TODAY
TOO
MUCH
OF
OUR
EVANGELISM
IS
NOTHING
BUT
SOFT
SOAP
AND
SOME
OF
IT
IS
NOTHING
BUT
EVANGELICAL
SALESMANSHIP
WE
DONT
TELL
PEOPLE
ANYMORE
THAT
THERES
SUCH
A
THING
AS
SIN
OR
THAT
THERES
SUCH
A
PLACE
AS
HELL
IT
WAS
THE
MYTH
OF
HELL
THAT
MADE
ME
FINALLY
REALIZE
THAT
THE
WHOLE
THING
WAS
UNTRUE
IF
IT
HADNT
BEEN
FOR
HELL
I
WOULD
STILL
BE
A
BELIEVER
TODAY
THE
MYTH
OF
HELL
MADE
ME
REALIZE
THAT
IF
THERE
WAS
A
GOD
THAT
HE
WAS
NOT
THE
ALL
KNOWING
AND
ALL
GOOD
GOD
HE
CLAIMED
TO
BE
WHY
SHOULD
I
TAKE
SUCH
A
BEING
AT
HIS
WORD
EVEN
IF
THERE
WAS
EVIDENCE
FOR
HIS
EXISTANCE
