BRUCE
STEPHENS
SUGGESTS
DIFFERENT
LEVELS
OF
ACCEPTANCE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
REGARD
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
AS
A
SIN
OR
EVIL
WHATEVER
REGARD
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOUR
AS
A
SIN
BUT
ACCEPT
ORIENTATION
THOUGH
PRESUMABLY
ORIENTATION
IS
UNFORTUNATE
AND
DISLIKE
PEOPLE
WHO
INDULGE
AS
BUT
LOVE
THE
SINNER
ACCEPT
HOMOSEXUALITY
ALTOGETHER
I
WOULD
ADD
OUR
CHURCHES
SHOULD
ACCEPT
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
BUT
HOLD
ALL
PEOPLE
TO
CERTAIN
STANDARDS
OF
SEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
PROMISCUITY
ABUSE
OF
POWER
RELATIONSHIPS
HARRASSMENT
COMPULSIVITY
ARE
EQUALLY
OUT
OF
PLACE
IN
THE
LIVES
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
AS
OF
HETEROSEXUAL
PEOPLE
OF
COURSE
THIS
WOULD
BRING
UP
THE
DREAD
SHIBBOLETH
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
MARRIAGE
AND
WE
COULDNT
HAVE
THAT
BILLH
