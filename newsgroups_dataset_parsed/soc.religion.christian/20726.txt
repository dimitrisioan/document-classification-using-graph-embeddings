RE
WHEN
ARE
TWO
PEOPLE
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
TO
RECAPITULATE
A
BIT
THE
ESSENCE
OF
MARRIAGE
IS
TWO
PEOPLES
COMMITMENT
TO
EACH
OTHER
IF
TWO
PEOPLE
CLAIM
TO
BE
MARRIED
IN
THEIR
HEARTS
BUT
ARE
NOT
WILLING
TO
HAVE
THE
MARRIAGE
RECOGNIZED
BY
CHURCH
AND
STATE
THATS
PRIMA
FACIE
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
COMMITMENT
ISNT
REALLY
THERE
THERE
ARE
OBVIOUS
SITUATIONS
IN
WHICH
CHRISTIAN
MARRIAGE
IS
POSSIBLE
WITHOUT
A
CIVIL
OR
CHURCH
WEDDING
IF
YOURE
STRANDED
ON
A
DESERT
ISLAND
OR
IF
YOUR
STATE
FORBIDS
THE
MARRIAGE
FOR
AN
UNJUST
REASON
EG
LAWS
AGAINST
INTERRACIAL
MARRIAGE
THE
LEGAL
CONCEPT
OF
COMMONLAW
MARRIAGE
IS
MEANT
TO
ENSURE
THAT
THE
STATE
WILL
RECOGNIZE
MARRIAGES
THAT
DID
NOT
START
OUT
WITH
THE
USUAL
CEREMONY
AND
RECORDKEEPING
PASTORALLY
IM
CONCERNED
THAT
PEOPLE
SHOULD
NOT
USE
BEING
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
AS
AN
EXCUSE
FOR
LIVING
TOGETHER
WITHOUT
A
FORMAL
WEDDING
ONE
HAS
A
DUTY
TO
HAVE
ONES
MARRIAGE
PROPERLY
RECORDED
AND
WITNESSED
BUT
THERE
ARE
ALSO
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
THROUGH
A
WEDDING
CEREMONY
WITHOUT
MAKING
A
GENUINE
COMMITMENT
AND
THEREFORE
ARE
NOT
MARRIED
IN
GODS
EYES
RIGHT

I
THINK
THE
LAST
STATEMENT
IS
DANGEROUS
I
BELIEVE
AS
LONG
AS
SOMEONE
HAS
FORMALLY
UNDERTAKEN
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
MARRIAGE
THEY
HAVE
A
MORAL
OBLIGATION
EVEN
IF
THEIR
INTENTION
WAS
NOT
RIGHT
OTHER
PEOPLE
ARE
INVOLVED
IN
THE
MARRIAGE
COVENANT
IF
THEY
BELIEVED
IN
GOOD
FAITH
THAT
A
MARRIAGE
OCCURRED
THEN
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
OBLIGATIONS
CREATED
TO
THEM
OF
COURSE
THERE
ARE
SITUATIONS
WHERE
INTENT
CAN
CAUSE
A
MARRIAGE
NOT
TO
EXIST
THE
CLASSIC
EXAMPLE
IS
WHEN
ITS
DONE
AS
PART
OF
A
PLAY
BUT
THESE
ARE
EXCEPTIONS
AND
SHOULD
BE
CLEAR
TO
ALL
PARTIES
