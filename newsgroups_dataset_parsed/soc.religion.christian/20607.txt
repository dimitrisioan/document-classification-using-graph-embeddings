EASTER
NOT
DERIVED
FROM
ISHTAR
SEVERAL
RECENT
POSTS
HAVE
IDENTIFIED
THE
ENGLISH
WORD
EASTER
WITH
THE
BABYLONIAN
GODDESS
ISHTAR
EASTER
IS
A
PAGAN
WORD
ALL
RIGHT
BUT
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
ISHTAR
IF
EASTER
AND
ISHTAR
WERE
RELATED
THEIR
HISTORY
WOULD
SHOW
IT
BUT
IN
OLD
ENGLISH
EASTER
WAS
EOSTRE
COGNATE
WITH
ENGLISH
EAST
AND
GERMAN
OST
THE
RECONSTRUCTED
PROTOGERMANIC
FORM
IS
AUSTRON
NOT
UNTIL
AFTER
DID
EASTER
HAVE
A
HIGH
FRONT
VOWEL
LIKE
ISHTAR
CLEARLY
THE
TWO
WORDS
HAVE
QUITE
SEPARATE
ORIGINS
THERE
MAY
BE
NEOPAGANS
WHO
WORSHIP
ISHTAR
AT
EASTER
BUT
IF
SO
THEY
ARE
MAKING
EITHER
A
MISTAKE
OF
ETYMOLOGY
OR
A
DELIBERATE
