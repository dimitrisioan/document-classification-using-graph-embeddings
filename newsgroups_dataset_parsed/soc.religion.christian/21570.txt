NOT
SHARE
THE
GUILT
OF
THE

THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
THE

TRY
TO
AVOID
FOUL

BASTARD
IS
CERTAINLY
FOUL
LANGUAGE
WHEN
SHOUTED
AT
SOMEONE
AS
AN
INSULT
BUT
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
WAS
BEING
USED
IN
ITS
ORIGINAL
TECHNICAL
SENSE
SIMILARLY
HELL
IS
AN
OBSCENITY
IN
SOME
CONTEXTS
BUT
NOT
WHEN
REFERRING
TO
THE
AFTERLIFE
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
TO
ME
THAT
BASTARD
IS
FOUL
LANGUAGE
WHEN
ITS
BEING
USED
IN
ITS
PROPER
MEANING
