JOSEPH
H
BUEHLER
WRITES
DESCRIPTIONS
OF
TRUE
AND
FALSE
OBEDIENCE
OBEDIENCE
IS
NOT
SOLELY
A
MATTER
OF
COMPLIANCEREFUSAL
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
COMMANDS
MUST
ALSO
BE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IT
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
TO
CONSIDER
SOMEONES
COMPLIANCE
OR
REFUSAL
AND
THEN
SAY
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
OBEDIENT
OR
DISOBEDIENT
YOU
ALSO
HAVE
TO
TAKE
INTO
CONSIDERATION
WHETHER
THE
COMMANDS
ARE
GOOD
OR
BAD
YOU
ASK
WHERE
WE
ARE
I
WOULD
ECHO
THAT
QUESTION
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
BE
CONTENTIOUS
BUT
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
POPE
HAS
UNIVERSAL
JURISDICTION
AND
AUTHORITY
WHAT
AUTHORITY
DO
YOU
RELY
UPON
FOR
YOUR
DECISIONS
WHAT
PREVENTS
ME
FROM
CHOOSING
ANY
DOCTRINE
I
LIKE
AND
SAYING
THAT
PAPAL
DISAGREEMENT
IS
AN
ERROR
THAT
WILL
BE
RESOLVED
IN
TIME
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
TRUE
SINCE
COUNCILS
OF
BISHOPS
HAVE
BASICALLY
STOOD
BY
THE
POPE
IT
APPEARS
THAT
MUCH
OF
WHAT
LIES
AT
THE
HEART
OF
THIS
MATTER
IS
DISAGREEMENTS
OVER
WHAT
IS
TRADITION
AND
TRADITION
AND
ALSO
OVER
AUTHORITY
AND
DISCIPLINE
MY
QUESTION
TO
THE
SUPPORTERS
OF
SSPX
IS
THIS
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
THAT
YOUR
POSITIONS
WITH
RESPECT
TO
CHURCH
REFORMS
COULD
CHANGE
AND
BE
CONFORMED
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
POPE
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
POPES
POSITION
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
AND
THAT
THE
LEADERS
OF
SSPX
DONT
JOINTLY
MAKE
SUCH
CHOICE
IF
NOT
THIS
APPEARS
TO
BE
CLAIMING
INFALLIBLE
TEACHING
AUTHORITY
IF
I
ADOPT
THE
VIEW
THAT
IM
NOT
WRONG
I
CANT
BE
WRONG
AND
THERES
NO
WAY
ILL
CHANGE
MY
MIND
YOU
MUST
CHANGE
YOURS
THAT
IVE
EITHER
LEFT
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
OR
IT
HAS
LEFT
ME
THE
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
DOES
NOT
RECOGNIZE
PAPAL
AUTHORITYJURISDICTION
VIEWING
AUTHORITY
AS
PRESENT
IN
EACH
BISHOP
AND
IN
ECUMENICAL
COUNCILS
WE
REGARD
THE
SUBSEQUENT
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
DOCTRINES
REGARDING
PAPAL
AUTHORITY
AND
JURISDICTION
TO
BE
A
SEPARATION
OF
THE
BISHOP
OF
ROME
FROM
THE
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
WITHOUT
GOING
INTO
THE
MERITS
OF
THE
GREAT
SCHISM
AT
LEAST
THE
ORTHODOX
AGREE
THAT
A
SPLIT
OCCURRED
AND
DONT
PALY
WHAT
APPEAR
TO
BE
SEMANTIC
GAMES
LIKE
HES
THE
POPE
BUT
WE
DONT
RECOGNIZE
THAT
WHAT
HE
DOES
IS
EFFECTIVE
WORDS
ASIDE
IT
APPEARS
TO
BE
A
DE
FACTO
SPLIT
SO
WHERE
ARE
WE
ARE
WE
IN
ANOTHER
ARIAN
HERESY
COMPLETE
WITH
WEAK
POPES
OR
ARE
THE
SSPX
PRIESTS
MODERN
MARTIN
LUTHERS
WELL
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
ANSWER
THAT
IS
TO
EXAMINE
WHO
IS
SAYING
WHAT
AND
WHAT
THE
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
OF
THE
CHURCH
IS
WE
SOULD
ARGUE
FROM
NOW
UNTIL
THE
SECOND
COMING
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
REAL
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
OF
THE
CHURCH
IS
IF
THIS
WERE
A
SIMPLE
MATTER
EAST
AND
WEST
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SEPARATED
FOR
OVER
YEARS
MANY
CATHOLICS
WILL
DECIDE
TO
SIDE
WITH
THE
POPE
THERE
IS
SOME
SOUNDNESS
IN
THIS
BECAUSE
THE
PAPACY
IS
INFALLIBLE
SO
EVENTUALLY
SOME
POPE
WILL
STRAIGHTEN
ALL
THIS
OUT
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
TEACHING
MAGISTERIEUM
OF
THE
CHURCH
DID
NOT
ALLOW
ERROR
IN
TEACHINGS
REGARDING
FAITH
AND
MORALS
EVEN
IN
THE
SHORT
TERM
I
MAY
BE
WRONG
HERE
IM
NOT
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
EFFECT
OF
A
POPE
MAKING
AN
EX
CATHEDRA
STATEMENT
REGARDING
THE
SSPX
SITUATION
WOULD
IT
BE
HONORED
IF
NOT
HOW
DO
YOU
GET
AROUND
THE
FORMAL
DOCTRINE
OF
INFALLIBILITY
AGAIN
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
BE
CONTENTIONS
IM
TRYING
TO
UNDERSTAND
SINCE
IM
ORTHODOX
IVE
GOT
NO
REAL
VESTED
INTEREST
IN
THE
OUTCOME
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
SCHISM
IS
A
SUPERSET
OF
DISOBEDIENCE
REFUSAL
TO
OBEY
A
LEGITIMATE
COMMAND
ALL
SCHISMATICS
ARE
DISOBEDIENT
BUT
ITS
A
SUPERSET
SO
IT
DOESNT
WORK
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
NOT
ALL
DISOBEYERS
ARE
SCHISMATICS
THE
MERE
FACT
THAT
THE
SSPX
PRIESTS
DONT
COMPLY
WITH
THE
HOLY
FATHERS
DESIRES
DOESNT
MAKE
THEM
SCHISMATICS
IT
DOES
IF
THE
COMMAND
WAS
LEGITIMATE
SSPX
DOES
NOT
VIEW
THE
POPES
COMMANDS
AS
LEGITIMATE
WHY
THIS
IS
A
VERY
SLIPPERY
SLOPE
BUT
MY
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
IS
THIS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
TRADITIONAL
THEOLOGY
OF
HOLY
ORDERS
EPISCOPAL
CONSECRATION
DOES
NOT
CONFER
JURISDICTION
IT
ONLY
CONFERS
THE
POWER
OF
ORDER
THE
ABILITY
TO
CONFECT
THE
SACRAMENTS
TRUE
ENOUGH
JURISDICTION
MUST
BE
CONFERRED
BY
SOMEONE
ELSE
WITH
THE
POWER
TO
CONFER
IT
SUCH
AS
THE
POPE
THE
SOCIETY
BISHOPS
KNOWING
THE
TRADITIONAL
THEOLOGY
QUITE
WELL
TAKE
GREAT
PAINS
TO
AVOID
ANY
PRETENCE
OF
JURISDICTION
OVER
ANYONE
THEY
SIMPLY
CONFER
THOSE
SACRAMENTS
THAT
REQUIRE
A
BISHOP
ONE
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
THEY
ARE
ESTABLISHING
A
NONGEOGRAPHIC
JURISDICTION
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THATS
EVEN
A
CONCEPT
OR
PROBLEM

CATHOLIC
