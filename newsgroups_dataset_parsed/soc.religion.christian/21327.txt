legal
definition
of
religion
its
my
understanding
that
the
us
supreme
court
has
never
given
a
legal
definition
of
religion
this
despite
the
many
cases
involving
religion
that
have
come
before
the
court
can
anyone
verify
or
falsify
this
has
any
state
or
other
government
tried
to
give
a
legal
definition
of
religion
