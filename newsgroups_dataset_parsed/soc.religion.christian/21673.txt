verse
divisions
im
wondering
if
anyone
knows
the
answer
to
a
rather
trivial
question
which
ive
been
thinking
about
what
was
the
process
used
to
divide
the
bible
into
verses
i
believe
jerome
divided
the
new
testament
but
ive
never
seen
any
discussion
of
how
he
did
this
it
seems
rather
arbitrary
as
opposed
to
for
example
making
each
sentence
a
verse
