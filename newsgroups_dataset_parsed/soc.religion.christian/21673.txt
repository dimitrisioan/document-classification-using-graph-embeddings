VERSE
DIVISIONS
IM
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
THE
ANSWER
TO
A
RATHER
TRIVIAL
QUESTION
WHICH
IVE
BEEN
THINKING
ABOUT
WHAT
WAS
THE
PROCESS
USED
TO
DIVIDE
THE
BIBLE
INTO
VERSES
I
BELIEVE
JEROME
DIVIDED
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
BUT
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANY
DISCUSSION
OF
HOW
HE
DID
THIS
IT
SEEMS
RATHER
ARBITRARY
AS
OPPOSED
TO
FOR
EXAMPLE
MAKING
EACH
SENTENCE
A
VERSE
