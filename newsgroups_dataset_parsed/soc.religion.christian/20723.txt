WRITES
HI
EVERYONE
IM
A
COMMITED
CHRISTIAN
THAT
IS
BATTLING
WITH
A
PROBLEM
I
KNOW
THAT
ROMANS
TALKS
ABOUT
HOW
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
OUR
FAITH
NOT
OUR
DEEDS
YET
HEBREWS
AND
JAMES
SAY
THAT
FAITH
WITHOUT
DEEDS
IS
USELESS
SAYING
YOU
FOOLS
DO
YOU
STILL
THINK
THAT
JUST
BELIEVING
IS
ENOUGH
SOME
DELETED
NOW
I
AM
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
YOU
A
SAVED
THROUGH
FAITH
ALONE
NOT
WHAT
YOU
DO
AS
TAUGHT
IN
ROMANS
BUT
HOW
CAN
I
SQUARE
UP
IN
MY
MIND
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
JAMES
IN
CONJUNCTION
WITH
THE
LUKEWARM
CHRISTIAN
BEING
SPATOUT
CAN
ANYONE
HELP
ME
THIS
REALLY
BOTHERS
ME
DEAR
WILL
IVE
NEVER
REPLIED
ON
THIS
THING
BEFORE
SO
I
HOPE
IT
GETS
THRU
OK
I
HAD
A
FEW
THOUGHTS
FAITH
ON
ITS
OWN
IF
NOT
ACCOMPANIED
BY
ACTION
IS
DEAD
JAMES
FAITH
IS
BOTH
BELIEF
AND
ACTION
IF
I
SAY
THAT
I
AM
A
GREAT
SWIMMER
BUT
I
NEVER
GO
SWIMMING
AM
I
REALLY
A
SWIMMER
AND
WILL
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
THAT
I
AM
LIKEWISE
IF
I
SAY
IM
A
CHRISTIAN
BUT
I
NEVER
TALK
TO
GOD
AM
I
REALLY
A
CHRISTIAN
MY
FAITH
IS
DEMONSTRATED
BY
MY
ACTION
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
TALK
TO
GOD
PROVES
WE
HAVE
FAITH
SATAN
BELIEVES
IN
GOD
BUT
DOES
NOT
FOLLOW
HIM
IN
A
SIMILAR
VEIN
I
HAVE
RECENTLY
BEEN
CHALLENGED
BY
SAYS
WE
KNOW
THAT
WE
HAVE
COME
TO
KNOW
HIM
IF
WE
OBEY
HIS
COMMANDS
I
FIND
THIS
VERSE
QUITE
ENCOURAGING
AS
IT
COULD
IMPLY
THAT
IF
WE
HAVE
COME
TO
KNOW
HIM
THEN
WELL
OBEY
HIS
COMMANDS
COS
HE
LIVES
WITHIN
US
AND
WE
CANNOT
HELP
BUT
OBEY
WHAT
HE
SAYS
I
TEND
TO
FEEL
THAT
AS
WE
DAILY
SUBMIT
OURSELF
TO
GOD
HE
WILL
KEEP
CHANGING
US
INTO
THE
LIKENESS
OF
JESUS
AND
HIS
FRUIT
AND
WORKS
WILL
BE
AUTOMATICALLY
PRODUCED
IN
OUR
LIVES
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
