THIS
IS
A
RFD
ON
A
PROPOSAL
FOR
A
NEWSGROUP
WHICH
WOULD
PROMOTE
A
SHARING
ON
THE
JOHANNINE
HOURS
AS
PROPOSED
EACH
MONTH
BY
THE
MONKS
OF
THE
ECUMENICAL
COMMUNITY
OF
TAIZE
PRONOUNCED
TEZAY
IN
FRANCE
NAME
OF
PROPOSED
NEWSGROUP
SOCRELIGIONTAIZE
UNMODERATED
PURPOSE
OF
THE
GROUP
THE
TAIZE
COMMUNITY
IS
AN
INTERNATIONAL
ECUMENICAL
COMMUNITY
OF
MONKS
BASED
IN
FRANCE
MANY
YOUNG
ADULTS
COME
THERE
TO
SEARCH
FOR
MEANING
IN
THEIR
LIFE
AND
TO
DEEPEN
THEIR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THEIR
FAITH
THROUGH
A
SHARING
WITH
OTHERS
THIS
NEWSGROUP
WILL
ALLOW
SUCH
A
SHARING
THROUGH
A
MONTHLY
JOHANNINE
HOUR
WHICH
WILL
BE
POSTED
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
EACH
MONTH
A
JOHANNINE
HOUR
INVOLVES
A
SHORT
COMMENTARY
ON
A
GIVEN
BIBLE
PASSAGE
FOLLOWED
BY
SOME
QUESTIONS
FOR
REFLECTION
ANY
THOUGHTS
THAT
MAY
ARISE
IN
CONSEQUENCE
AND
THAT
YOU
WISH
TO
SHARE
WITH
OTHERS
CAN
BE
POSTED
HERE
WE
ARE
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
THEOLOGICAL
DEBATE
AND
EVEN
LESS
IN
POLEMICS
NO
EXPERTISE
IS
REQUIRED
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
HELP
ONE
ANOTHER
TO
DEEPEN
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
SCRIPTURE
AS
IT
IS
RELATED
TO
OUR
OWN
LIFEJOURNEY
THE
IDEA
OF
JOHANNINE
HOURS
WAS
BORN
IN
TAIZE
AS
A
SIMPLE
RESPONSE
TO
ALL
THOSE
WHO
WERE
TRYING
TO
ASSIMILATE
THE
BIBLES
MESSAGE
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THEIR
DAILY
LIFE
BECAUSE
OF
WORK
OR
STUDIES
IT
IS
OFTEN
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
SPEND
LONG
HOURS
IN
SILENCE
AND
REFLECTION
BUT
EVERYONE
CAN
TAKE
AN
HOUR
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
TO
ENTER
A
CHURCH
SIT
QUIETLY
AT
HOME
OR
GO
OUT
FOR
A
WALK
IN
THE
WOODS
THERE
IN
SILENCE
WE
CAN
MEDITATE
ON
A
PASSAGE
OF
SCRIPTURE
TO
LISTEN
TO
THE
VOICE
OF
CHRIST
DURING
THE
TIME
OF
SILENCE
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
CONCENTRATE
ON
WHAT
WE
UNDERSTAND
AND
NOT
WASTE
TIME
WORRYING
IF
IN
SOME
BIBLICAL
EXPRESSIONS
WE
FIND
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
HEAR
THE
VOICE
OF
CHRIST
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
COMMUNICATE
TO
OTHERS
WHAT
WE
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
OF
CHRIST
NOT
BURDENING
THEM
WITH
OUR
OWN
HESITATIONS
BUT
RATHER
TELLING
THEM
WHAT
HAS
BROUGHT
US
JOY
WHAT
HAS
LED
US
TO
RUN
THE
RISK
OF
TRUSTING
MORE
DEEPLY
PERHAPS
THOSE
WHO
READ
AND
THINK
ABOUT
THE
JOHANNINE
HOURS
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
COULD
SHARE
THEIR
REFLECTIONS
AND
DISCOVERIES
WITH
OTHERS
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
IS
THE
COMPLEMENTARITY
BETWEEN
TWO
ASPECTS
THE
PERSONAL
ASPECT
OF
SILENT
PERSONAL
REFLECTION
AND
THE
COMMUNAL
ASPECT
OF
SHARING
WHICH
THROUGH
USENET
MAKES
US
A
PART
OF
A
WORLDWIDE
NETWORK

OF
THE
TAIZE
