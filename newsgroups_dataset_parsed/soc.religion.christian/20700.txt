CONCERNING

THE
IDEA
WAS
INTRODUCED
TO
ME
ONCE
THAT
THE
REASON
PAUL
WANTED
THE
CORINTHIANS
TO
LAY
ASIDE
MONEY
FOR
THE
COLLECTION
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
WAS
THAT
THIS
WAS
WHEN
THEY
RECEIVED
THEIR
WEEKLY
WAGES
BUT
THE
ANCIENT
ROMANS
DID
NOT
OBSERVE
A
SEVENDAY
WEEK
UNLESS
A
MAN
WAS
WORKING
FOR
A
JEWISH
EMPLOYER
HE
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
HAVE
BEEN
PAID
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
A
SEVENDAY
WEEK
NOR
WOULD
A
JEWISH
EMPLOYER
HAVE
KEPT
HIS
WAGES
OVER
THE
WEEKEND
