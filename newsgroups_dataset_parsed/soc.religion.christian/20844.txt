re
rebuilding
the
temple
was
re
anybody
out
there

writes
now
it
appears
that
nothing
stands
in
the
way
of
rebuilding
and
resuming
sacrifices
as
the
scriptures
indicate
will
happen
in
the
last
days
although
the
israeli
government
will
give
the
permission
to
start
i
think
it
is
the
hand
of
god
holding
the
project
until
he
is
ready
to
let
it
happen
brothers
and
sisters
the
time
is
at
hand
our
redemption
is
drawing
near
look
up
how
is
a
scriptural
levitical
priesthood
resumed
are
there
any
jews
who
can
legitimately
prove
their
levite
bloodline
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
jewish
family
names
cohen
kahn
etc
are
considered
to
be
legitimate
indicators
of
descent
from
aaron
the
family
names
levi
levene
etc
are
considered
to
be
legitimate
indicators
of
descent
from
levi
the
main
legal
issue
is
the
purification
of
the
priesthood
which
is
supposed
to
involve
finding
the
ashes
of
of
the
red
heifer
last
used
for
this
purpose
years
ago
