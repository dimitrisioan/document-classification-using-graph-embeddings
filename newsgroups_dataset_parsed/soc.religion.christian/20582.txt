QUALITY
OF
CATHOLIC
LITURGY

JOHN
E
MURRAY
WRITES
I
WOULD
LIKE
THE
OPINION
OF
NETTERS
ON
A
SUBJECT
THAT
HAS
BEEN
BOTHERING
MY
WIFE
AND
ME
LATELY
LITURGY
IN
PARTICULAR
CATHOLIC
LITURGY
IN
THE
LAST
FE
YEARS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THERE
ARE
MORE
AND
MORE
AD
HOC
EVENTS
DURING
MASS
ITS
DRIVING
ME
CRAZY
THE
MOST
GRACEFILLED
ASPECT
OF
A
LITURGICAL
TRADITION
IS
THAT
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
SOMETHING
WE
ALL
DO
TOGETHER
BECAUSE
WE
ALL
KNOW
HOW
DO
IT
LED
BY
THE
PRIEST
OF
COURSE
WHICH
MAKES
IT
A
KIND
OF
DIALOGUE
WE
PRESENT
TO
GOD
BUT
THE
BEST
MASSES
IVE
BEEN
TO
WERE
PARTICIPATORY
PRAYERS
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
THERE
ARE
ADVANTAGES
TO
HAVING
THE
LITURGY
STAY
THE
SAME
JOHN
HAS
DESCRIBED
SOME
OF
THESE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
SOME
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
START
TUNING
OUT
THE
SAME
OLD
WORDS
AND
PAY
ATTENTION
BETTER
WHEN
THINGS
GET
CHANGED
AROUND
I
THINK
INNOVATIVE
PRIESTS
AND
LITURGY
COMMITTEES
ARE
TRYING
TO
GET
OUR
ATTENTION
AND
MAKE
THINGS
MORE
MEANINGFUL
FOR
US
IT
DRIVES
ME
CRAZY
TOO
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
HAVE
DIFFERING
PREFERENCES
AND
NEEDS
IN
LITURGY
MY
LOCAL
PARISH
IS
INNOVATIVE
I
PREFER
TO
GO
TO
MASS
AT
THE
NEXT
PARISH
OVER
SOMETIMES
WE
DONT
HAVE
THE
OPTION
OF
ATTENDING
A
MASS
IN
THE
STYLE
WHICH
BEST
SUITS
US
JOHN
PUT
A
SMILEY
ON
IT
BUT
TO
JUST
OFFER
IT
UP
PROBABLY
IS
THE
SOLUTION
A
RELATED
ISSUE
THAT
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
JOHN
DOES
NOT
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
IS
THAT
SPOUSES
MAY
HAVE
DIFFERENT
LITURGICAL
TASTES
MY
HUSBAND
DOES
LIKE
INNOVATIVE
LITURY
IT
IS
A
CHALLENGE
TO
MEET
BOTH
OF
OUR
SPIRITUAL
NEEDS
WITHOUT
JUST
GOING
OUR
SEPARATE
WAYS
WHEN
YOU
INCLUDE
THE
FACTOR
OF
ALSO
TRYING
TO
SATISFY
OUR
CHILDRENS
NEEDS
THINGS
GET
PRETTY
COMPLICATED
ONE
THING
TO
REMEMBER
IS
THAT
EVEN
THE
MOST
UNCONGENIAL
MASS
IS
STILL
MASS
