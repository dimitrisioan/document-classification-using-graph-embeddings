JAYNE
KULIKAUSKAS
WRITES
I
AM
UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH
THE
TRACT
IN
GENERAL
BECAUSE
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
INNAPPROPRIATE
EMPHASIS
ON
HELL
GOD
DESERVES
OUR
LOVE
AND
WORSHIP
BECAUSE
OF
WHO
HE
IS
I
DO
NOT
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
FRIGHTENING
PEOPLE
INTO
ACCEPTING
CHRIST
AND
YET
JAYNE
AS
WE
READ
THE
GOSPELS
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
TOPICS
THAT
JESUS
HIMSELF
SPOKE
ON
HELL
FIGURES
IN
A
LARGE
OF
THE
TIME
CERTAINLY
MORE
THAN
HEAVEN
ITSELF
PAUL
AS
WE
LEARN
IN
I
THESS
TAUGHT
NEW
BELIEVERS
AND
NEW
CHURCHES
ESCHATOLOGY
AND
DID
NOT
HESITATE
TO
TEACH
HELL
AND
DAMNATION
REV
CHAPTER
IS
VERY
SPECIFIC
AND
CANNOT
BE
ALLEGORIZED
I
THINK
THE
WORD
THRONE
IS
USED
TIMES
IN
REV
AND
THAT
THE
UNBELIEVING
COME
TO
RECEIVE
THE
ASSIGNMENT
OF
THE
SEVERITY
OF
JUDGEMENT
FOR
IN
JOHN
WE
READ
THAT
THEY
ARE
ALREADY
JUDGED
ROM
SPEAKS
THAT
EVERY
MOUTH
WILL
BE
SHUT
THERE
IS
NO
RECOURSE
EXCUSE
OR
DEFENSE
I
SEE
EVANGELISM
AS
COMBINING
A
WAY
OF
LIVING
THAT
SHOWS
GODS
LOVE
WITH
PUTTING
INTO
WORDS
AND
EXPLAINING
THAT
LOVE
PREACHING
THE
GOSPEL
WITHOUT
LIVING
THE
GOSPEL
IS
NO
BETTER
THAN
BEING
A
NOISY
GONG
OR
A
CLANGING
CYMBAL
YES
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
LIFE
IS
OFTEN
LIKE
A
PENDULUM
WHERE
IT
SWINGS
TO
EXTREMES
BEFORE
STOPPING
AT
MODERATION
I
THINK
WE
HAVE
SEEN
THE
EXTREME
OF
THE
HELL
FIRE
BRIMSTONE
PREACHER
BUT
ALSO
WE
HAVE
SEEN
THE
OTHER
EXTREME
WHERE
HELL
NOT
TALKED
ABOUT
AT
ALL
FOR
FEAR
OF
OFFENDING
SOMEONES
SENSIBILITIES
I
FORGET
WHO
FOUNDED
THE
WORD
OF
LIFE
MINISTRIES
BUT
I
REMEMBER
HIM
TELLING
A
STORY
HE
WAS
IN
A
SMALL
TOWN
HARDWARE
STORE
AND
SOME
HOW
A
MAN
GOT
TO
THE
POINT
OF
TELLING
HIM
THAT
HE
DIDNT
BELIEVE
IN
SATAN
OR
HELL
HE
BELIEVED
EVERYBODY
WAS
GOING
TO
HEAVEN
IT
WAS
AT
THIS
POINT
THAT
THE
MAN
WAS
ASKED
TO
PRAY
TO
GOD
THAT
HE
WOULD
SEND
HIS
CHILDREN
TO
HELL
OF
COURSE
THE
MAN
WOULDNT
DO
IT
BUT
THE
POINT
WAS
MADE
MANY
PEOPLE
SAY
THEY
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
HELL
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
WILLING
TO
REALLY
PLACE
THEIR
FAITH
IN
THAT
IT
DOESNT
EXIST
IF
THIS
MAN
HAD
HE
WOULD
OF
PRAYED
THE
PRAYER
BECAUSE
HELL
DIDNT
EXIST
AND
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NO
FEAR
IN
HAVING
HIS
PRAYER
ANSWERED
AND
YET
THEY
WALK
AS
IF
THEY
BELIEVE
THEY
WILL
NEVER
BE
SENT
THERE
ID
USE
A
DIFFERENT
ILLUSTRATION
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
TO
INCLUDE
MYSELF
IN
IT
WHEN
I
WATCH
SAY
A
BASKETBALL
GO
BULLS
GAME
AND
I
SEE
A
BLATANT
FOUL
THAT
ISNT
CALLED
OI
VEY
WHATS
WITH
THAT
REF
THAT
HE
DIDNT
MAKE
THAT
CALL
ITS
UNFAIR
AND
JUST
SO
IN
LIFE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
DEMANDS
PAYMENT
AS
THE
SURGEON
TAKES
KNIFE
IN
HAND
TO
CUT
THE
CANCER
AWAY
SO
GOD
CUTS
OFF
THAT
WHICH
IS
STILL
OF
THE
OLD
CREATION
WE
MUST
PREACH
THE
GOSPEL
IN
ALL
ITS
RICHNESS
WHICH
INCLUDES
THE
FACT
THAT
IF
YOU
REJECT
THE
WAY
AND
THE
TRUTH
AND
THE
LIFE
THEN
BROAD
IS
THE
WAY
TO
DISTRUCTION
HERES
A
QUESTION
HOW
MANY
OF
YOU
ARE
CHRISTIANS
BECAUSE
YOU
ARE
AFRAID
OF
GOING
TO
HELL
HOW
MANY
ARE
RESPONDING
TO
GODS
LOVE
I
THINK
I
WOULD
FALL
IN
THERE
SOMEWHERE
ACTUALLY
IT
WAS
BOTH
AFTER
ALL
REPENTANCE
ISNT
ONLY
A
TURNING
TOWARDS
BUT
ALSO
A
TURNING
AWAY
FROM
NO
AGAIN
IF
JESUS
USED
IT
IN
HIS
MINISTRY
THEN
I
CAN
SURELY
SEE
THAT
WE
SHOULD
DO
IT
ALSO
IN
LOVE
OF
COURSE
BUT
IN
TRUTH
MOST
ASSUREDLY
I
HAVE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
WRITING
SOMETHING
ON
THIS
TOPIC
BUT
NOT
NOW
AND
HERE
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
GOOD
REASONS
FOR
ITS
EXISTENCE
AND
ITS
ETERNALITY
GOD
IS
LIGHT
YES
HE
IS
LOVE
BUT
HIS
LOVE
HAS
THE
BOUNDARY
OF
HOLINESS
DIGNITY
OF
MAN
EITHER
A
MAN
IS
A
ROBOT
OR
HE
IS
A
RESPONSIBLE
CREATURE
IF
RESPONSIBLE
THEN
HE
IS
ALSO
ACCOUNTABLE
THE
AWFULNESS
OF
SIN
TODAY
WE
HAVE
A
POOR
POOR
CONCEPT
OF
SIN
GOD
CHRIST
HE
WAS
WILLING
TO
DIE
AND
GO
THERE
HIMSELF
TO
OFFER
AN
AVENUE
TO
THE
WHOSOEVER
WILL
