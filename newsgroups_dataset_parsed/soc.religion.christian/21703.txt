RICK
GRANBERRY
WRITES
SEE
BELOW
I
WONT
QUOTE
ANY
OF
IT
BUT
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
ERRORS
IN
THE
ARTICLE
NOT
THINGS
THAT
ARE
JUST
DIFFERENCES
OF
OPINION
BUT
THE
WRITER
JUST
PLAIN
HAS
HIS
FACTS
CONFUSED
FOR
EXAMPLE
KIP
MCKEAN
WAS
ASKED
TO
COME
TO
THE
LEXINGTON
CHURCH
BY
THE
LEADERS
THERE
HE
BROUGHT
NO
TEAM
HE
ACTUALLY
HAD
BEEN
IN
CHARLESTON
IL
UP
TO
THAT
POINT
HE
HAD
MANY
FRIENDS
EVEN
LEADERS
IN
GAINESVILLE
TELLING
HIM
NOT
TO
GO
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
NORTHEAST
WERENT
OPEN
AND
HED
BE
WASTING
HIS
TIME
AND
TALENTS
REALLY
THIS
FACT
WAS
A
KIND
OF
INSIDE
JOKE
AT
ONE
POINT
AFTER
THE
CHURCH
IN
BOSTON
TOOK
OFF
SO
WELL
NOT
OPEN
INDEED
I
COULD
TAKE
IT
ON
POINT
BY
POINT
BUT
I
AM
NOT
IN
A
POSITION
TO
KNOW
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
ABOUT
SOME
THINGS
IN
THE
ARTICLE
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
IT
CONTAINS
MISINFORMATION
MARK
