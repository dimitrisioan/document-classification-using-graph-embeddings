RE
SSPX
SCHISM
HERE
IS
SOME
MATERIAL
BY
MICHAEL
DAVIES
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
SCHISM
IN
GENERAL
AND
ARCHISHOP
LEFEBVRE
IN
PARTICULAR
HE
WROTE
IT
AROUND
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THE
TWOPART
ARTICLE
WAS
ON
THE
SCANDALOUS
ACTIVITIES
OF
ARCHBISHOP
WEAKLAND
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
BUT
I
CUT
ALL
THAT
AND
I
PARED
DOWN
THE
REST
TO
WHAT
WAS
RELEVANT
JOE
BUEHLER
SCHISM
AND
DISOBEDIENCE
ACCORDING
TO
ST
THOMAS
AQUINAS
SCHISM
CONSISTS
PRIMARILY
IN
A
REFUSAL
OF
SUBMISSION
TO
THE
POPE
OR
COMMUNION
WITH
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
CHURCH
UNITED
TO
HIM
ON
FIRST
SIGHT
IT
WOULD
APPEAR
THAT
WHATEVER
THE
SUBJECTIVE
MOTIVATION
OF
THE
ARCHBISHOP
AS
DISCUSSED
ABOVE
HE
MUST
BE
IN
A
STATE
OF
OBJECTIVE
SCHISM
AS
HE
HAS
REFUSED
TO
SUBMIT
TO
THE
POPE
ON
A
VERY
GRAVE
MATTER
INVOLVING
HIS
SUPREME
POWER
OF
JURISDICTION
HOWEVER
STANDARD
CATHOLIC
TEXTBOOKS
OF
THEOLOGY
MAKE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
WHILE
ALL
SCHISMS
INVOLVE
DISOBEDIENCE
NOT
ALL
ACTS
OF
DISOBEDIENCE
ARE
SCHISMATIC
IF
THIS
WERE
SO
AS
WAS
NOTED
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THIS
ARTICLE
IT
WOULD
MEAN
THAT
THE
NUMBER
OF
AMERICAN
BISHOPS
WHO
ARE
NOT
SCHISMATIC
WOULD
NOT
REACH
DOUBLE
FIGURES
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
DISOBEDIENCE
AND
SCHISM
IS
MADE
VERY
CLEAR
IN
THE
ARTICLE
ON
SCHISM
IN
THE
VERY
AUTHORITATIVE
DICTIONNAIRE
DE
THEOLOGIE
CATHOLIQUE
THE
ARTICLE
IS
BY
FATHER
YVES
CONGAR
WHO
IS
CERTAINLY
NO
FRIEND
OF
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRE
HE
EXPLAINS
THAT
SCHISM
AND
DISOBEDIENCE
ARE
SO
SIMILAR
THAT
THEY
ARE
OFTEN
CONFUSED
FATHER
CONGAR
WRITES
THAT
SCHISM
INVOLVES
A
REFUSAL
TO
ACCEPT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
LEGITIMATE
AUTHORITY
IN
THE
CHURCH
FOR
EXAMPLE
LUTHERS
REJECTION
OF
THE
PAPACY
FATHER
CONGAR
EXPLAINS
THAT
THE
REFUSAL
TO
ACCEPT
A
DECISION
OF
LEGITIMATE
AUTHORITY
IN
A
PARTICULAR
INSTANCE
DOES
NOT
CONSTITUTE
SCHISM
BUT
DISOBEDIENCE
THE
CATHOLIC
ENCYCLOPEDIA
EXPLAINS
THAT
FOR
A
CATHOLIC
TO
BE
TRULY
SCHISMATIC
HE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
INTEND
TO
SEVER
HIMSELF
FROM
THE
CHURCH
AS
FAR
AS
IN
HIM
LIES
IT
ADDS
THAT
NOT
EVERY
DISOBEDIENCE
IS
SCHISM
IN
ORDER
TO
POSSESS
THIS
CHARACTER
IT
MUST
INCLUDE
BESIDES
THE
TRANSGRESSION
OF
THE
COMMAND
OF
THE
SUPERIORS
A
DENIAL
OF
THEIR
DIVINE
RIGHT
TO
COMMANDNOT
ONLY
DOES
MGR
LEFEBVRE
NOT
DENY
THE
DIVINE
RIGHT
OF
THE
POPE
TO
COMMAND
BUT
HE
AFFIRMS
REPEATEDLY
HIS
RECOGNITION
OF
THE
POPES
AUTHORITY
AND
HIS
INTENTION
OF
NEVER
BREAKING
AWAY
FROM
ROME
THE
ARCHBISHOP
MADE
HIS
ATTITUDE
CLEAR
IN
THE
JULYAUGUST
ISSUE
OF
DAYS
WE
PRAY
FOR
THE
POPE
EVERY
DAY
NOTHING
HAS
CHANGED
WITH
THE
CONSECRATIONS
LAST
JUNE
WE
ARE
NOT
SEDEVACANTISTS
WE
RECOGNIZE
IN
JOHN
PAUL
II
THE
LEGITIMATE
POPE
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
WE
DONT
EVEN
SAY
THAT
HE
IS
A
HERETICAL
POPE
WE
ONLY
SAY
THAT
HIS
MODERNIST
ACTIONS
FAVOR
HERESY
INTRINSICALLY
SCHISMATIC
THE
PRINCIPAL
ARGUMENT
USED
BY
THOSE
CLAIMING
THAT
MGR
LEFEBVRE
IS
IN
SCHISM
IS
THAT
THE
CONSECRATION
OF
A
BISHOP
WITHOUT
A
PAPAL
MANDATE
IS
AN
INTRINSICALLY
SCHISMATIC
ACT
A
BISHOP
WHO
CARRIES
OUT
SUCH
A
CONSECRATION
IT
IS
CLAIMED
BECOMES
IPSO
FACTO
A
SCHISMATIC
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
IF
SUCH
A
CONSECRATION
IS
AN
INTRINSICALLY
SCHISMATIC
ACT
IT
WOULD
ALWAYS
HAVE
INVOLVED
THE
PENALTY
OF
EXCOMMUNICATION
IN
THE
CODE
OF
CANON
LAW
THE
OFFENCE
WAS
PUNISHED
ONLY
BY
SUSPENSION
SEE
CANON
OF
THE
CODE
POPE
PIUS
XII
HAD
RAISED
THE
PENALTY
TO
EXCOMMUNICATION
AS
A
RESPONSE
TO
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
SCHISMATIC
CHURCH
IN
CHINA
THE
CONSECRATION
OF
THESE
ILLICIT
CHINESE
BISHOPS
DIFFERED
RADICALLY
FROM
THE
CONSECRATIONS
CARRIED
OUT
BY
MGR
LEFEBVRE
AS
THE
PROFESSED
INTENTION
WAS
TO
REPUDIATE
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
POPE
THAT
IS
TO
DENY
THAT
HE
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
GOVERN
THE
CHURCH
AND
THE
ILLICITLY
CONSECRATED
CHINESE
BISHOPS
WERE
GIVEN
A
MANDATE
TO
EXERCISE
AN
APOSTOLIC
MISSION
NEITHER
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRE
NOR
ANY
OF
THE
BISHOPS
HE
HAS
CONSECRATED
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
HAVE
POWERS
OF
JURISDICTION
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
CONSECRATED
SOLELY
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ENSURING
THE
SURVIVAL
OF
THE
SOCIETY
BY
CARRYING
OUT
ORDINATIONS
AND
ALSO
TO
PERFORM
CONFIRMATIONS
I
DO
NOT
WISH
TO
MINIMIZE
IN
ANY
WAY
THE
GRAVITY
OF
THE
STEP
TAKE
BY
MGR
LEFEBVRE
THE
CONSECRATION
OF
BISHOPS
WITHOUT
A
PAPAL
MANDATE
IS
FAR
MORE
SERIOUS
MATTER
THAN
THE
ORDINATION
OF
PRIESTS
AS
IT
INVOLVES
A
REFUSAL
IN
PRACTICE
OF
THE
PRIMACY
OR
JURISDICTION
BELONGING
BY
DIVINE
RIGHT
TO
THE
ROMAN
PONTIFF
BUT
THE
ARCHBISHOP
COULD
ARGUE
THAT
THE
CRISIS
AFFLICTING
THE
CHURCH
COULD
NOT
BE
MORE
GRAVE
AND
THAT
GRAVE
MEASURES
WERE
NEEDED
IN
RESPONSE
IT
APPEARS
TO
BE
TAKEN
FOR
GRANTED
BY
MOST
OF
THE
ARCHBISHOPS
CRITICS
THAT
HE
WAS
EXCOMMUNICATED
FOR
THE
OFFENSE
OF
SCHISM
AND
THE
VATICAN
HAS
CERTAINLY
BEEN
GUILTY
OF
FOSTERING
THIS
IMPRESSION
THERE
IS
NOT
SO
MUCH
AS
A
MODICUM
OF
TRUTH
IN
THIS
ALLEGATION
THE
NEW
CODE
OF
CANON
LAW
INCLUDES
A
SECTION
BEGINNING
WITH
CANON
ENTITLED
PENALTIES
FOR
SPECIFIC
OFFENSES
DE

IN

AGAINST

OF

DE
DELICTIS
CONTRA

ET
ECCLESIAE
UNITATEM
CANON
DEALS
WITH
THE
OFFENSE
OF
SCHISM
WHICH
IS
EVIDENTLY
TOGETHER
WITH
APOSTASY
AND
HERESY
ONE
OF
THE
THREE
FUNDAMENTAL
OFFENSES
AGAINST
THE
UNITY
OF
THE
CHURCH
BUT
THE
ARCHBISHOP
WAS
NOT
EXCOMMUNICATED
UNDER
THE
TERMS
OF
THIS
CANON
OR
INDEED
UNDER
ANY
CANON
INVOLVING
AN
OFFENSE
AGAINST
RELIGION
OR
THE
UNITY
OF
THE
CHURCH
THE
CANON
CITED
IN
HIS
EXCOMMUNICATION
COMES
FROM
THE
THIRD
SECTION
OF
PENALTIES
FOR
SPECIFIC
OFFENSES
WHICH
IS
ENTITLED
USURPATION

FUNCTIONS
AND
OFFENSES
IN
THEIR
EXERCISE
DE

THE
CANON
IN

IS
CANON
WHICH
READS
A
BISHOP
WHO
CONSECRATES
SOMEONE
BISHOP
AND
THE
PERSON
WHO
RECEIVES
SUCH
A
CONSECRATION
FROM
A
BISHOP
WITHOUT
A
PONTIFICAL
MANDATE
INCUR
AN
AUTOMATIC
LATAE
SENTENTIAE
EXCOMMUNICATION
RESERVED
TO
THE
HOLY
SEE
THE
SCANDALOUS
ATTEMPTS
TO
SMEAR
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRE
WITH
THE
OFFENSE
OF
SCHISM
ARE
THEN
CONTRARY
TO
BOTH
TRUTH
AND
CHARITY
A
COMPARABLE
SMEAR
UNDER
CIVIL
AS
OPPOSED
TO
ECCLESIASTICAL
LAW
WOULD
CERTAINLY
JUSTIFY
LEGAL
ACTION
FOR
LIBEL
INVOLVING
MASSIVE
DAMAGES
AN
ACCURATE
PARALLEL
WOULD
BE
TO
STATE
THAT
A
MAN
CONVICTED
OF
MANSLAUGHTER
HAD
BEEN
CONVICTED
OF
FIRST
DEGREE
MURDER
I
MUST
STRESS
THAT
WHAT
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
HERE
IS
NOT
THE
DUBIOUS
OPINION
OF
LAYMEN
UNVERSED
IN
THE
INTRICACIES
OF
CANON
LAW
CANON
LAWYERS
WITHOUT
THE
LEAST
SHRED
OF
SYMPATHY
FOR
MGR
LEFEBVRE
HAVE
REPUDIATED
THE
CHARGE
OF
SCHISM
MADE
AGAINST
HIM
AS
TOTALLY
UNTENABLE
FATHER
PATRICK
YALDRINI
DEAN
OF
THE
FACULTY
OF
CANON
LAW
OF
THE
INSTITUT
CATHOLIQUE
IN
PARIS
NOTED
IN
THE
JULY
ISSUE
OF
VALEURS
ACTUELLES
THAT
AS
I
HAVE
JUST
EXPLAINED
MGR
LEFEBVRE
WAS
NOT
EXCOMMUNICATED
FOR
SCHISM
BUT
FOR
THE
USURPATION
OF
AN
ECCLESIASTICAL
FUNCTION
HE
ADDED
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
CONSECRATION
OF
A
BISHOP
WHICH
CONSTITUTES
SCHISM
BUT
THE
CONFERRAL
OF
AN
APOSTOLIC
MISSION
UPON
THE
ILLICITLY
CONSECRATED
BISHOP
IT
IS
THIS
USURPATION
OF
THE
POWERS
OF
THE
SOVEREIGN
PONTIFF
WHICH
PROVES
THE
INTENTION
OF
ESTABLISHING
A
PARALLEL
CHURCH
CARDINAL
ROSALIO
LARA
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
PONTIFICAL
COMMISSION
FOR
THE
AUTHENTIC
INTERPRETATION
OF
CANON
LAW
COMMENTED
ON
THE
CONSECRATIONS
IN
THE
JULY
ISSUE
OF
LA
REPUBBLICA
IT
WOULD
BE
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
A
MORE
AUTHORITATIVE
OPINION
THE
CARDINAL
WROTE
THE
ACT
OF
CONSECRATING
A
BISHOP
WITHOUT
A
PAPAL
MANDATE
IS
NOT
IN
ITSELF
A
SCHISMATIC
ACT
IN
FACT
THE
CODE
THAT
DEALS
WITH
OFFENSES
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
SECTIONS
ONE
DEALS
WITH
OFFENSES
AGAINST
RELIGION
AND
THE
UNITY
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
THESE
ARE
APOSTASY
SCHISM
AND
HERESY
CONSECRATING
A
BISHOP
WITH
A
PONTIFICAL
MANDATE
IS
ON
THE
CONTRARY
AN
OFFENSE
AGAINST
THE
EXERCISE
OF
A
SPECIFIC
MINISTRY
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
CONSECRATIONS
CARRIED
OUT
BY
THE
VIETNAMESE
ARCHBISHOP
NGO
DINH
THUC
IN
AND
ALTHOUGH
THE
ARCHBISHOP
WAS
EXCOMMUNICATED
HE
WAS
NOT
CONSIDERED
TO
HAVE
COMMITTED
A
SCHISMATIC
ACT
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
NO
INTENTION
OF
A
BREACH
WITH
THE
CHURCH
IT
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
UNJUST
BUT
LUDICROUS
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
IN
CONSECRATING
BISHOPS
WITHOUT
A
PAPAL
MANDATE
ARCHBISHOP
LEFEBVRE
HAD
THE
LEAST
INTENT
OF
ESTABLISHING
A
SCHISMATIC
CHURCH
HE
IS
NOT
A
SCHISMATIC
AND
WILL
NEVER
BE
A
SCHISMATIC
THE
ARCHBISHOP
CONSIDERS
CORRECTLY
THAT
THE
THE
CHURCH
IS
UNDERGOING
ITS
WORST
CRISIS
SINCE
THE
ARIAN
HERESY
AND
THAT
FOR
THE
GOOD
OF
THE
CHURCH
IT
WAS
NECESSARY
FOR
HIM
TO
CONSECRATE
THE
FOUR
BISHOPS
TO
ENSURE
THE
FUTURE
OF
HIS
SOCIETY
CANON
LAW
PROVIDES
FOR
JUST
SUCH
A
SITUATION
AND
EVEN
IF
ONE
BELIEVES
THAT
THE
FUTURE
OF
THE
SOCIETY
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
GUARANTEED
WITHOUT
THESE
CONSECRATIONS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ARCHBISHOP
BELIEVED
SINCERELY
THAT
IT
COULD
NOT
MEANS
AS
CANON
LAW
STATES
CLEARLY
THAT
HE
HAS
NOT
INCURRED
EXCOMMUNICATION
FURTHERMORE
WHILE
THE
VATICAN
ALLOWS
SUCH
PRELATES
AS
ARCHBISHOP
WEAKLAND
TO
UNDERMINE
THE
FAITH
WITH
IMPUNITY
IT
CANNOT
EXPECT
CATHOLICS
TO
PAY
THE
LEAST
ATTENTION
TO
ITS
SANCTIONS
AGAINST
A
GREAT
AND
ORTHODOX
ARCHBISHOP
WHOSE
ENTIRE
LIFE
HAS
BEEN
DEVOTED
TO
THE
SERVICE
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
THE
SALVATION
OF
SOULS
DR
ERIC
M
DE
SAVENTHEM
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
INTERNATIONAL
UNA
VOCE
ASSOCIATION
IS
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
INFORMED
LAYMEN
IN
THE
CHURCH
AND
HE
KNOWS
THE
ARCHBISHOP
INTIMATELY
DR
DE
SAVENTHEM
LIKE
MYSELF
HAS
NO
GREATER
DESIRE
THAN
TO
SEE
A
RECONCILIATION
BETWEEN
MGR
LEFEBVRE
AND
THE
HOLY
SEE
DURING
THE
ARCHBISHOPS
LIFETIME
A
QUOTATION
FROM
A
STATEMENT
BY
DR

WHICH
WAS
PUBLISHED
IN
THE

CAREFUL

IN
RETROSPECT
THE
ROAD
LEADING
TO
THE
CONSECRATIONS
OF
JUNE
APPEARS
MORE
PAVED
WITH
GRAVE
ROMAN
AND
UNFORTUNATELY
ALSO
PAPAL
OMISSIONS
THAN
WITH
LEFEBVRIST
OBSTINANCIES
AND
FROM
THE
EYES
OF
AN
INFORMED
PUBLIC
THIS
CANNOT
BE
HIDDEN
BY
ATTEMPTING
TO
PRESENT
THE
ARCHBISHOPS
ACT
OF
GRAVE
DISOBEDIENCE
AS
AN
OFFENSE
AGAINST
THE
FAITH
IT
IS
SAIDTODAYTHAT
MGR
LEFEBVRE
HAS
AN
ERRONEOUS
CONCEPT
OF
TRADITION
IF
THIS
WERE
SO
CARDINAL
RATZINGER
COULD
NOT
ON
BEHALF
OF
THE
POPE
HAVE
ADDRESSED
TO
THE
ARCHBISHOP
THE
FOLLOWING
WORDS
IN
HIS
LETTER
OF

YOUR
ARDENT

TRADITION
