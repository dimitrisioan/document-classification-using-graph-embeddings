doesnt
the

say
that
god
is
a

sic
if
this

how

what
do
you
mean
fair
god
is
just
giving
to
everyone
what
they
deserve
as
all
infants
are
in
sin
from
the
time
of
conception
cf
romans
psalm
they
cannot
possibly
merit
heaven
and
as
purgatory
is
for
the
purging
of
temporal
punishment
and
venial
sins
it
is
impossible
that
origianl
sin
can
be
forgiven
why
is
it
fair
to
punish
you
me
and
the
rest
of
humanity
because
of
what
adam
and
eve
did
suppose
your
parents
committed
some
crime
before
you
were
born
and
one
day
the
cops
come
to
your
door
and
throw
you
in
jail
for
it
would
you
really
think
that
is
fair
i
know
i
wouldnt
well
suppose
your
mother
was
a
crack
addict
and
crack
userabuser
while
she
was
pregnant
suppose
your
husband
gave
you
some
sdt
this
recently
happened
to
a
close
friend
of
my
wife
and
mine
often
the
consequences
of
our
sin
are
at
least
partially
inflicted
on
innocent
people
several
times
in
the
ot
this
is
pointed
out
even
saying
that
descendants
would
suffer
consequences
for
a
persons
sin
for
several
generations
even
today
we
see
multigenerational
to
coin
a
phrase
effects
from
alcoholism
child
abuse
and
spousal
abuse
just
to
name
three
so
gods
definition
of
fair
and
ours
differ
some
points
of
perspective
though
the
predisposition
towards
sinning
is
now
inbred
see
websters
first
definition
of
inbred
thanks
to
adam
it
is
arrogant
and
foolish
for
any
of
us
to
think
we
would
have
done
any
different
if
we
were
in
their
shoes
i
know
myself
pretty
well
and
im
just
not
that
good
take
gods
word
for
it
neither
are
you
there
is
no
one
righteous
more
important
when
a
person
decides
to
be
a
disciple
of
jesus
god
promises
supernatural
help
in
overcoming
our
physical
selfs
sinful
tendency
we
can
of
course
choose
to
ignore
this
help
rom
god
made
mankind
upright
but
men
have
gone
in
search
of
many
schemes
