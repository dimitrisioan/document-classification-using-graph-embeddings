WHAT
DO
WE
FEEL
I
SEE
A
PARALLEL
BETWEEN
WHAT
I
WILL
STUPIDLY
CALL
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
ISSUE
AND
THE
ATHEIST
ISSUE
PLEASE
TAKE
NO
OFFENSE
AT
THESE
COMPARISONS
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
FEELS
THINGS
THAT
I
ADMIT
I
DO
NOT
FEEL
HE
LEARNS
THAT
THESE
FEELINGS
ARE
CLASSIFIED
AS
HOMOSEXUAL
FEELINGS
AND
LEARNS
OF
A
MODEL
OF
SEXUALITY
THAT
SEEMS
TO
APPLY
TO
HIS
FEELINGS
WHICH
HE
THEN
CAN
FIT
WITH
HIS
EXPERIENCES
THAT
IS
THIS
MODEL
GIVES
HIM
A
SENSE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
HIS
SITUATION
MODELS
THAT
DO
NOT
MATCH
UP
WITH
WHAT
HE
KNOWS
HE
FEELS
WILL
BE
DISCARDED
HOWEVER
ONE
WONDERS
IF
ONCE
ACCEPTING
THE
IDEA
OF
HIS
BEING
GAY
AND
DECIDING
WHAT
EXACTLY
THAT
MEANS
HE
WILL
ANALYZE
ALL
HIS
FEELINGS
AND
EXPERIENCES
BASED
ON
THE
DEFINITION
HE
HAS
ALREADY
ACCEPTED
WHICH
OF
COURSE
VALIDATES
HIS
MODEL
IF
THAT
WAS
HARD
TO
UNDERSTAND
NOW
LISTEN
TO
MY
PARALLEL
THE
CHRISTIAN
FEELS
THINGS
THAT
AN
ATHEIST
CLAIMS
HE
DOES
NOT
FEEL
THE
CHRISTIAN
ACCEPTS
THE
CHRISTIAN
THEOLOGY
AS
THE
TRUE
DESCRIPTION
OF
WHAT
HIS
FEELINGS
MEAN
ONCE
ACCEPTING
THIS
MODEL
HE
INTERPRETS
HIS
EXPERIENCES
WITH
REGARDS
TO
THIS
MODEL
WHICH
OF
COURSE
VALIDATES
HIS
CHRISTIANITY
AS
A
REMINDER
I
AM
A
CHRISTIAN
A
CATHOLIC
I
DONT
HATE
HOMOSEXUALS
OR
ATHEISTS
BUT
AM
JUST
TRYING
TO
UNDERSTAND
THEM
I
ONLY
COMPARE
THEM
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
BOTH
SO
FOREIGN
TO
ME
AM
I
AS
BLIND
TO
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
AS
THE
ATHEIST
SEEMS
BLIND
TO
ME
OR
AM
I
AS
PREJUDICED
AGAINST
ATHEISTIC
DENIAL
OF
RELIGIOUS
EXPERIENCE
AS
THE
HOMOSEXUAL
IS
PREJUDICED
AGAINST
ATTEMPTS
BY
SOCIETY
TO
DENY
HIS
SEXUALITY
OR
AM
I
JUST
OUT
TO
LUNCH
AGAIN
