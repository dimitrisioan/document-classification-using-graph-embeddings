wrote
recently
an
email
to
me
mentioned
technically
the
messengers
arent
even
human
so
it
cant
be
a
case
of
homosexuality
even
of
rape
the
jude
reference
to
sodom
is
also
meaningful
only
in
the
context
of
the
sodomites
lust
for
the
other
flesh
of
angels
again
application
to
homosexual
behavior
in
general
or
to
the
position
of
gay
christians
is
largeely
specious
are
angels
flesh
no
i
feel
that
this
is
saying
that
it
was
because
of
their
lust
after
other
men
who
are
flesh
or
of
this
world
what
are
other
opinons
on
this
i
havent
heard
much
about
this
verse
at
all
bo
reike
in
the
anchor
bible
volume
on
james
peter
and
jude
points
out
that
all
the
examples
given
in
this
section
of
jude
are
distinguishing
the
elect
from
apostates
not
just
the
wicked
in
general
hence
those
who
were
delivered
from
egypt
but
did
not
follow
moses
and
by
extension
god
the
apostate
angels
and
sodom
and
gomorrah
quoting
reike
fornication
may
here
as
often
in
the
new
testament
refer
to
idolatry
while
flesh
as
in
i
pet
denotes
human
society
and
its
violent
attempts
at
self
exaltation
sodom
and
gommorrah
represent
the
leaders
of
apostasy
and
the
surrounding
cities
correspond
to
their
followers
p
there
is
no
inherent
reason
to
read
this
verse
as
literally
referring
to
actual
sexual
lust
for
alien
flesh
nor
is
it
inherently
necessary
to
understand
it
as
referring
to
homosexuality
outside
of
the
circular
reasoning
that
has
already
concluded
that
the
sin
of
sodom
is
the
sin
of
homosexuality
the
only
place
that
the
sin
of
sodom
is
specified
and
not
merely
inferred
is
in
ezekiel
this
was
the
guilt
of
your
sister
sodom
she
and
her
daughters
had
pride
excess
of
food
and
prosperous
ease
bit
did
not
aid
the
poor
and
needy
they
were
haughty
and
did
abominable
things
before
me
therefore
i
removed
them
when
i
saw
it
for
the
same
reason
overliteralizing
the
text
your
correspondents
suggestion
that
the
reason
the
passage
doesnt
deal
with
homosexuality
is
because
the
guests
were
angels
and
not
men
is
just
silly
there
are
much
more
solid
reasons
for
pointing
out
the
irrelevance
of
the
sodom
passages
for
dealing
with
homosexuality
