MUCH
DELETED
POINT
TODAY
MIGHT
BE
THE
MASONS
JUST
A
NOTE
THAT
THEY
TOO
WORSHIPPED
OSIRIS
IN
EGYPT
MUCH
DELETED
IT
BUGS
ME
WHEN
I
SEE
THIS
KIND
OF
NONSENSE
FIRST
THERE
IS
NO
REASONABLE
EVIDENCE
LINKING
MASONRY
TO
ANCIENT
EGYPT
OR
EVEN
THAT
IT
EXISTED
PRIOR
TO
THE
LATE
CENTURY
AND
THERES
NOTHING
DEFINITIVE
BEFORE
THE
MY
WIFES
UNCLE
WAS
A
LEVEL
MASON
HE
LET
ME
LOOK
AT
SOME
OF
THE
BOOKS
WHICH
AFTER
HIS
DEATH
HIS
BROTHERS
CAME
OVER
AND
TOOK
FROM
HIS
GREIVING
WIDOW
BEFORE
HIS
BODY
HAD
EVEN
COOLED
DONT
TELL
ME
YOU
DONT
WORSHIP
OSIRIS
YOU
MUST
NOT
BE
PAST
YOUR
LEVEL
YOU
SHOULD
READ
WILKINSONS
EGYPTIANS
AND
HOW
HE
SHOWS
THIS
EGYPTIAN
RELIGION
PARALLELING
HIS
OWN
BRITISH
MASONRY
THERE
IS
A
MAN
HERE
AT
THIS
LABORATORY
WHO
IS
A
DEGREE
BLACK
MASON
IVE
TALKED
WITH
HIM
THOUGH
MUCH
HE
LIKES
TO
HIDE
MYSTERY
SPECIAL
HANDSHAKES
AND
ALL
WHEN
HE
FIRST
STARTED
TRYING
TO
EVANGELIZE
ME
HE
TOLD
ME
ALL
KINDS
ON
SPECIAL
THIS
AND
SPECIAL
THAT
HERE
IS
TRUELY
A
MYSTERY
RELIGION
THERE
IS
THE
PUBLIC
SIDE
WITH
MOTORCYLE
MANIA
AND
CHILDRENS
HOSPITALS
AND
THEN
THERE
IS
THE
PRIVIATE
SIDE
THAT
ONLY
THE
HIGHEST
DEGREE
MASON
EVERY
LEARNS
OF
SECOND
WORSHIP
OF
OSIRIS
IS
NOT
NOR
HAS
IT
EVER
BEEN
A
PART
OF
MASONIC
PRACTICE
WE
ARE
STRICTLY
NONDENOMINATIONAL
I
HAVENT
READ
IT
BUT
THE
LITERATURE
THAT
IS
OFFERED
BY
THE
SILVER
HAIRED
APOLOGIST
CANT
REMEMBER
HIS
NAME
ON
TV
DIDNT
EXACTLY
COME
TO
THIS
SAME
CONCLUSION
KHONS
THE
SON
OF
THE
GREAT
GODDESSMOTHER
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
GERNAERALLY
REPRESENTED
AS
A
FULLGROWN
GOD
THE
BABYLONIAN
DIVINITY
WAS
ALSO
REPRESENTED
VERY
FREQUENTLY
IN
EGUPT
IN
THE
VERY
SAME
WAYAS
IN
THE
LAND
OF
HIS
NATIVITY
IE
AS
A
CHILD
IN
HIS
MOTHERS
AREMS
THIS
WAS
THE
WAY
IN
WHICH
OSIRIS
THE
SON
THE
HUSBAND
OF
HIS
MOTHER
WAS
OFTEN
EXHIBITED
AND
WHAT
WE
LEARN
OF
THIS
GOD
EQUALLY
AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
KHONSO
SHOWS
THAT
IN
HIS
ORIGINAL
HE
WAS
NONE
OTHER
THAN
NIMROD
IT
IS
ADMITTED
THAT
THE
SECRET
SYSTEM
OF
FREE
MASONRY
WAS
ORIGINALLY
FOUNDED
ON
THE
MYSTERIES
OF
THE
EGYPTIAN
ISIS
THE
GODDESSMOTHER
OR
WIFE
OF
OSIRIS
BUT
WHAT
COULD
HAVE
LED
TO
THE
UNION
OF
A
MASONIC
BODY
WITH
THESE
MYSTERIES
HAD
THEY
NOT
HAD
PARTICULAR
REFERENCE
TO
ARCHITECTURE
AND
HAD
THE
GOD
WHO
WAS
WORSHIPPED
IN
THEM
NOT
BEEN
CELEBRATED
FOR
HIS
SUCCESS
IN
PERFECTING
THE
ARTS
OF
FORTIFICATION
AND
BUILDING
NOW
IF
SUCH
WERE
THE
CASE
CONSIDERING
THE
RELATION
IN
WHICH
AS
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
SEEN
EGYPT
STOOD
TO
BABYLON
WHO
WOULD
NATURALLY
BE
LIIKED
UP
TO
THERE
AS
THE
GREAT
PATRON
OF
THE
MASONIC
ART
THE
STRONG
PRESUMPTION
IS
THAT
NIMROD
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
THE
MAN
HE
WAS
THE
FIRST
THAT
GAINED
FAIM
IN
THIS
WAY
AS
THE
CHILD
OF
THE
BABYLONIAN
GODDESSMOTHER
HE
WAS
WORSHIPPED
IN
THE
CHARACTER
OF
ALA
MAHOZIM
THE
GOD
OF
FORTIFICATION
OSIRIS
THE
CHILD
OF
THE
EGYPTIAN
MODONNA
WAS
EQUALLY
CELEBRATED
AS
THE
STRONG
CHIEF
OF
THE
BUILDINGS
THIS
STRONG
CHIEF
OF
THE
BUILDINGS
WAS
ORIGNINALLY
WORSHIPPED
IN
EGYPT
WITH
EVERY
PHYSICALL
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
NIMROD
I
HAVE
ALREADY
NOTICED
THE
FACT
THAT
NIMROD
AS
THE
SON
OF
CUSH
WAS
A
NEGRO
NOW
THERE
WAS
A
TRADITION
IN
EGYPT
RECORDED
BY
PLUTARCH
THAT
OSIRIS
WAS
BLACK
HISLOP
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
COLD
SLAP
TO
MY
FACE
WHEN
MY
WIFES
UNCLE
BROUGHT
OUT
HIS
CERIMONIAL
DRESS
AND
IT
WAS
LEOPARD
SKIN
I
MEAN
REAL
LEOPARD
SKIN
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
ONLY
THE
HIGHEST
OF
DEGREES
WORE
THE
LEOPARD
SKIN
THE
REASON
THAT
HE
STARTED
TELLING
ME
ALL
THIS
WAS
THAT
HE
HAD
JUST
BEEN
GIVEN
A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
TO
LIVE
AND
MY
WIFE
HAD
LED
HIM
TO
A
SAVING
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
AND
HE
IMMEDIATELY
REPENTED
FROM
MYSTERIES
OF
THE
LODGE
NIMRROD
FROM
NIMR
A
LEOPARD
AND
RADA
OR
RAD
TO
SUBDUE
IT
IS
A
UNIVERSAL
PRINCIPLE
IN
ALL
IDOLATRIES
THAT
THE
HIGH
PRIEST
WEARS
THE
INSIGNIA
OF
THE
GOD
HE
SERVES
ANY
REPRESENTATION
OF
OSIRIS
USUALLY
SHOW
THE
WEARING
OF
SOME
LEOPARD
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THAT
THE
DRUIDS
OF
BRITIAN
ALSO
SHOW
OR
SHOULD
I
SAY
HIDE
THIS
REPRESENTATION
THEY
HOWEVER
WORSHIPPED
THE
SPOTTED
COW
ILL
STAND
BY
MY
STATEMENTS
MASONRY
IS
OF
THE
MYSTERY
RELIGIONS
THAT
ALL
FIND
THEIR
SOURCE
IN
BABYLON
THE
GREAT
HARLOT
SORRY
PETER
I
DO
NOT
MEAN
TO
BE
A
COLD
SLAP
TO
THE
FACE
BUT
THERE
IS
TO
MUCH
EVIDENCE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
THAT
MASONRY
DOESNT
FIND
ITS
ORIGINS
IN
EGYPT
OF
THE
MASONS
I
HAVE
PERSONALLY
TALKED
TO
ALL
REFERED
TO
EGYPT
AS
THEIR
ORIGIN
WHY
ARE
YOU
NOW
SEPARATING
YOURSELF
FROM
THIS
WHICH
NOT
MANY
YEARS
AGO
WAS
FREELY
ADMITTED
