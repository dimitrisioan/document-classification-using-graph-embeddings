WRITES
DID
YOU
KNOW
THAT
JESUS
TALKED
MORE
ABOUT
HELL
THAN
HE
DID
ABOUT
HEAVEN
THANK
YOU
FOR
THIS
INFO
WHAT
RESPECT
I
HAD
FOR
THE
MAN
NOW
HAS
BEEN
DIMINISHED
TENFOLD
I
PROMISE
NEVER
AGAIN
TO
SAY
HOW
WISE
OR
LOVING
THIS
MAN
WAS
I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
UNDERSTANDING
THIS
ATTITUDE
IF
THE
GOSPELS
ARE
THE
LEAST
BIT
ACCURATE
THEN
THERE
CAN
BE
LITTLE
DOUBT
THAT
JESUS
BELIVED
HELL
WAS
A
REALITY
AS
A
TEACHER
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
WISE
AND
LOVING
THING
TO
DO
IF
PEOPLE
IN
YOUR
AUDIENCE
WERE
HEADED
THERE
TO
WARN
THEM
IT
WOULD
HOWEVER
BE
RATHER
CRUEL
ANDOR
SADISTIC
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
SUCH
A
PLACE
EXISTS
AND
THEN
REMAIN
QUIET
ABOUT
IT
THE
ONLY
SCENARIO
I
CAN
ENVISION
IN
WHICH
DIMISHED
RESPECT
WOULD
BE
JUSTIFIED
IS
IF
JESUS
KNEW
THERE
WAS
NO
SUCH
PLACE
AS
HELL
AND
SPOKE
ABOUT
IT
ANYWAY
JUST
TO
SCARE
PEOPLE
UNLESS
YOU
WOULD
ACCUSE
JESUS
OF
THIS
I
WOULD
ENCOURAGE
YOU
TO
RECONSIDER
WHAT
A
LOVING
RESPONSE
IS
WHEN
YOU
PERCEIVE
SOMEONE
TO
BE
IN
DANGER
DAVE
