LETS
TALK
ABOUT
PRINCIPLES
IF
WE
ACCEPT
THAT
GOD
SETS
THE
STANDARDS
FOR
WHAT
OUGHT
TO
BE
INCLUDED
IN
SCRIPTURE
THEN
WE
CAN
ASK
IS
IT
AUTHORITATIVE
AUTHORITATIVE
IS
NOT
A
QUALITY
OF
THE
WRITING
ITSELF
IT
IS
A
STATEMENT
BY
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
FAITH
WHETHER
IT
WILL
ACCEPT
THE
WRITING
AS
NORMATIVE
ARGUABLY
IT
IS
BOTH
SINCE
AUTHORITY
IS
A
MATTER
OF
BOTH
COMMUNICATOR
AND
RECEPIANT
WE
CAN
SAY
THAT
FOR
EXAMPLE
JESUS
IS
LORD
WHETHER
THE
WORLD
AT
LARGE
ACCEPTS
THE
AUTHORITY
OR
NOT
THUS
THE
BIBLE
CAN
BE
CONSIDERED
FOR
ITS
AUTHORITATIVE
CONTENT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
IS
ACCEPTED
THIS
ISSUE
IS
AT
THE
HEART
OF
PILATES
PRAGMATIC
QUESTION
WHAT
IS
TRUTH
TO
JESUS
WHEN
OUR
LORD
WAS
BROUGHT
BEFORE
HIM
JESUS
REPLY
WAS
TO
APPEAL
TO
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
HIS
FATHER
YOU
ALSO
MIGHT
LIKE
TO
CONSIDER
THE
CLAIMED
AUTHORITY
REPRESENTED
BY
THE
STATEMENTS
THUS
SAYS
THE
LORD
IN
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
CLAIM
TO
PUT
ACROSS
THE
EXACT
WORDS
OF
GOD
YOU
FALL
INTO
THE
DANGER
OF
RELATIVISM
WITH
YOUR
REJECTION
OF
INHERANT
AUTHORITY
AND
CLAIM
THAT
IT
LIES
ONLY
IN
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
FAITH
DOES
SOMETHING
BECOME
TRUTH
BECAUSE
IT
IS
ACCEPTED
THE
MAIN
THRUST
OF
MY
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
A
GODWARD
DIRECTION
AS
WELL
AS
A
MANWARD
WHICH
IS
WHERE
THE
REFERENCE
TO
REV
CAME
IN
IS
IT
PROPHETIC
HOW
IS
PROPHECY
TO
BE
DEFINED
IF
IT
IS
SPEAKING
FORTH
OF
GODS
MESSAGE
MUCH
OF
THE
APOCRYPHA
MUST
SURELY
QUALIFY
IF
WE
NARROWED
IT
DOWN
TO
THE
PREDICTIVE
ELEMENTS
WHICH
WILL
CUT
OUT
SOME
OF
THE
ACCEPTED
OT
BOOKS
AS
WELL
WE
NONETHELESS
HAVE
CRITERIA
FOR
DETERMINING
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THE
BOOK
JESUS
STANDARDS
WERE
THAT
SCRIPTURE
CANNOT
BE
BROKEN
CAN
YOU
NAME
A
SINGLE
PROPHECY
THAT
FITS
THE
BILL
IN
THE
APOCRAPHA
IE
DEFINITELY
FULFILLED
AFTER
IT
HAS
BEEN
WRITTEN
IS
IT
AUTHENTIC
AGAIN
BY
WHAT
STANDARD
IS
AUTHENTICITY
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
AUTHORS
THE
HISTORICAL
ACCURACY
DOES
IT
HAVE
A
SUBJECTIVE
RING
OF
TRUTH
ABOUT
IT
AND
DOES
OTHER
EVIDENCE
THAT
HAS
COME
TO
LIGHT
CONTRADICT
OR
CONFIRM
THE
AUTHENTICITY
ARCHAEOLOGICAL
OTHER
TEXTUAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
EXAMPLE
IS
IT
DYNAMIC
WHAT
IS
THIS
SUPPOSED
TO
MEAN
MANY
OF
THE
APOCRYPHAL
BOOKS
ARE
HIGHLY
DYNAMIC
THOUGHT
PROVOKING
FAITHFUL
EVEN
EXCITING
WHAT
THIS
IS
GETTING
AT
IS
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
TEXT
AND
READER
IT
IS
TO
DO
WITH
THE
QUALITY
OF
WRITING
WHICH
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
ABILITY
TO
FIRE
THE
MIND
AFFECT
OUR
THOUGHT
LIFE
AND
CAUSE
US
TO
ACT
IN
A
CERTAIN
WAY
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
OF
THIS
IN
JESUS
QUOTE
MAN
DOES
NOT
LIVE
BY
BREAD
ALONE
BUT
BY
EVERY
WORD
THAT
PROCEEDS
FROM
THE
MOUTH
OF
THE
LORD
MATT
IS
IT
RECEIVED
COLLECTED
READ
AND
USED
BY
WHOM
OF
COURSE
THE
APOCRYPHAL
BOOKS
WERE
RECEIVED
BY
SOME
COLLECTED
OR
ELSE
WE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
THEM
READ
AND
USED
AND
THEY
STILL
ARE
IN
THE
CATHOLIC
AND
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
DOES
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
GIVE
THE
SAME
AUTHORITY
TO
THE
APOCRAPHA
AS
TO
THE
ACCEPTED
BOOKS
CERTAINLY
IT
IS
NOT
AS
WIDELY
USED
AS
THE
OT
AND
NT
ON
THESE
COUNTS
THE
APOCRAPHA
FALLS
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
THIS
IS
DEMONSTRABLY
FALSE
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
I
HAVE
SAID
ABOVE
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
REVISE
YOUR
CONCLUSION
IN
ADDITION
THINK
ABOUT
OTHER
SACRED
WRITINGS
EG
THE
KORAN
THE
BOOK
OF
MORMON
AND
HOW
AND
WHY
YOU
WOULD
CATEGORISE
THEM
USING
THE
ABOVE
PRINCIPLES
ONE
WORD
OF
CAUTION
YOU
MAY
FIND
SOME
REFLECTED
GLORY
IN
SOME
OF
THESE
BOOKS
IN
THAT
THE
INSPIRED
QUALITY
MAY
BE
DERIVED
FROM
THE
BIBLE
REMEMBER
THAT
LUCIFER
IS
QUITE
CAPABLE
OF
APPEARING
AS
AN
ANGEL
OF
LIGHT
AND
QUOTING
SCRIPTURE
TO
QUOTE
UNGERS
BIBLE
DICTIONARY
ON
THE
APOCRAPHA
THEY
ABOUND
IN
HISTORICAL
AND
GEOGRAPHICAL
INACCURACIES
AND
ANACHRONISMS
SO
DO
OTHER
BOOKS
OF
THE
BIBLE
WHAT
WERE
YOU
THINKING
OF
DELETIONS
HOW
DO
YOU
THEN
VIEW
THE
WORDS
I
WARN
EVERYONE
WHO
HEARS
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
PROPHECY
OF
THIS
BOOK
IF
ANYONE
ADDS
ANYTHING
TO
THEM
GOD
WILL
ADD
TO
HIM
THE
PLAGUES
DESCRIBED
IN
THIS
BOOK
AND
IF
ANYONE
TAKES
AWAY
FROM
THIS
BOOK
THE
PROPHECY
GOD
WILL
TAKE
AWAY
FROM
HIM
HIS
SHARE
IN
THE
TREE
OF
LIFE
AND
IN
THE
HOLY
CITY
REV
SURELY
THIS
SETS
THE
STANDARD
AND
NOT
JUST
MANMADE
TRADITIONS
THESE
WORDS
CLEARLY
WERE
MEANT
TO
REFER
TO
THE
BOOK
OF
REVELATION
ALONE
NOT
TO
THE
WHOLE
BODY
OF
SCRIPTURE
REVELATION
ITSELF
WAS
ACCEPTED
VERY
LATE
INTO
THE
CANON
THE
CHURCH
SIMPLY
DID
NOT
SEE
IT
AS
HAVING
A
PRIMARY
ROLE
OF
ANY
KIND
IN
IDENTIFYING
AND
LIMITING
SCRIPTURE
WEVE
LOST
THE
POINT
AND
THE
CONTEXT
HERE
I
AM
NOT
ARGUING
THAT
THE
STATEMENT
IN
REV
CAN
BE
APPLIED
INDESCRIMINATELY
JUST
THAT
THE
WHOLE
ACCEPTANCEREJECTION
IDEA
DOES
NOT
JUST
FOLLOW
ON
FROM
MANMADE
TRADITIONS
BUT
THERE
IS
I
BELIEVE
AN
ACT
OF
GOD
INVOLVED
IN
THE
SELECTION
AND
CRITERIA
OF
WHAT
IS
CLASSIFIED
AS
SCRIPTURE
AND
COMES
UNDER
THE
DEFINITION
OF
REVDAKNETCOMCOM
BARNEY
RESSON
MANY
SHALL
RUN
TO
AND
FRO
KNOWLEDGE
SHALL
INCREASE
