RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
NEWSCBNEWSKATTCOM
WRITES
ARROGANCE
IS
ARROGANCE
IT
IS
NOT
THE
RESULT
OF
RELIGION
IT
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
PEOPLE
KNOWING
OR
FIRMLY
BELIEVING
IN
AN
IDEA
AND
ONES
DESIRE
TO
SHOW
OTHERS
OF
ONES
RIGHTNESS
I
ASSUME
THAT
GOD
DECIDED
TO
BE
JUDGE
FOR
OUR
SAKE
AS
MUCH
AS
HIS
OWN
IF
WE
ALLOW
HIM
WHO
IS
KIND
AND
MERCIFUL
BE
THE
JUDGE
WELL
PROBABLY
BE
BETTER
OFF
THAN
IF
OTHERS
JUDGED
US
OR
WE
JUDGED
OURSELVES
COR
BUT
IF
WE
JUDGED
OURSELVES
WE
WOULD
NOT
COME
UNDER
JUDGMENT
WHEN
WE
ARE
JUDGED
BY
THE
LORD
WE
ARE
BEING
DISCIPLED
SO
THAT
WE
WILL
NOT
BE
CONDEMNED
WITH
THE
WORLD
COR
EVEN
THOUGH
I
AM
NOT
PHYSICALLY
PRESENT
I
AM
WITH
YOU
IN
SPIRIT
AND
I
HAVE
ALREADY
PASSED
JUDGMENT
ON
THE
ONE
WHO
DID
THIS
JUST
AS
IF
I
WERE
PRESENT
COR
THE
SPIRITUAL
MAN
MAKES
JUDGMENTS
ABOUT
ALL
THINGS
BUT
HE
HIMSELF
IS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
ANY
MANS
JUDGEMENT
FOR
WHO
HAS
KNOWN
THE
MIND
OF
THE
LORD
THAT
HE
MAY
INSTRUCT
HIM
BUT
WE
HAVE
THE
MIND
OF
CHRIST
JUDE
ENOCH
THE
SEVENTH
FROM
ADAM
PROPHESIED
ABOUT
THESE
MEN
SEE
THE
LORD
IS
COMING
WITH
THOUSANDS
UPON
THOUSANDS
OF
HIS
HOLY
ONES
TO
JUDGE
EVERYONE
AND
TO
CONVICT
ALL
THE
UNGODLY
OF
ALL
THE
UNGODLY
ACTS
THEY
HAVE
DONE
IN
THE
UNGODLY
WAY
AND
OF
ALL
THE
HARSH
WORDS
UNGODLY
SINNERS
HAVE
SPOKEN
AGAINST
HIM
ARROGANCE
IS
A
SIN
ALTHOUGH
A
DESIRE
TO
SHOW
OTHERS
OF
ONES
RIGHTNESS
MAY
BE
A
SIGN
OF
ARROGANCE
IN
SOME
CASES
IT
MAY
BE
ONLY
A
SIGN
THAT
THEY
ARE
FOLLOWING
THE
BIBLE
IN
OTHERS
JUDE
BE
MERCIFUL
TO
THOSE
WHO
DOUBT
SNATCH
OTHERS
FROM
THE
FIRE
AND
SAVE
THEM
TO
OTHERS
SHOW
MERCY
MIXED
WITH
FEAR
HATING
EVEN
THE
CLOTHING
STAINED
BY
CORRUPTED
FLESH
IF
I
FIND
SOMEONE
ARROGANT
I
TYPICALLY
DONT
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THEM
I
HOPE
YOU
DONT
FIND
ME
ARROGANT
THEN
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
BAD
PRACTICE
IGNORING
WHAT
CERTAIN
PEOPLE
SAY
BECAUSE
YOU
PERCEIVE
THEM
AS
ARROGANT
JAMES
MY
DEAR
BROTHERS
TAKE
NOTE
OF
THIS
EVERYONE
SHOULD
BE
QUICK
TO
LISTEN
SLOW
TO
SPEAK
AND
SLOW
TO
BECOME
ANGRY
