RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS

WRITES
ID
LIKE
TO
SHARE
MY
THOUGHTS
ON
THIS
TOPIC
OF
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
AND
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
ANY
RESPONSES
IN
MY
ENCOUNTERS
WITH
CHRISTIANS
I
FIND
MYSELF
DISMAYED
BY
THEIR
BELIEF
THAT
THEIR
FAITH
IS
TOTAL
TRUTH
ACCORDING
TO
THEM
THEIR
BELIEFS
COME
FROM
THE
BIBLE
AND
THE
BIBLE
IS
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
AND
GOD
IS
TRUTH
THUS
THEY
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
THIS
STANCE
MAKES
IT
DIFFICULT
TO
DISCUSS
OTHER
FAITHS
WITH
THEM
AND
MY
OWN
HESITATIONS
ABOUT
CHRISTIANITY
BECAUSE
THEY
SEE
NO
OTHER
WAY
THEIR
WAY
IS
THE
TRUTH
BUT
I
SEE
THEIR
FAITH
ARISING
FROM
A
WILLFUL
CHOICE
TO
BELIEVE
A
PARTICULAR
WAY
THAT
CHOICE
IS
PART
FAITH
AND
PART
REASON
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
A
CHOICE
IM
SORT
OF
MYSTIFIED
ABOUT
HOW
A
CHRISTIAN
MIGHT
RESPOND
TO
THIS
ILL
START
WITH
A
PARABLE
A
CHRISTIAN
WOMAN
HIRES
A
CARPENTER
TO
BUILD
HER
A
BIRDHOUSE
WHEN
HE
COMES
OVER
THEY
BEGIN
TALKING
ABOUT
RELIGION
SO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
UNDERSTAND
GOD
HE
ASKS
YES
I
DO
SHE
REPLIES
THEN
HAVE
HIM
BUILD
YOU
THE
BIRDHOUSE
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
MELINDA
IS
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
THE
BASIS
OF
CHRISTIAN
BELIEF
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
A
TENDENCY
AMONG
CHRISTIANS
TO
SAY
I
HAVE
ALL
THE
ANSWERS
BECAUSE
GOD
GAVE
THEM
TO
ME
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
NOT
THE
CASE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
INERRANT
HOWEVER
OUR
HUMAN
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
THE
BIBLE
ARE
NECESSARILY
IN
ERROR
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
HUMAN
AND
IMPERFECT
WE
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
WE
ALL
MAKE
MISTAKES
IN
FAITH
AND
THAT
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
HUMAN
WE
HAVE
AN
IMPERFECT
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
MIND
AND
WILL
OF
GOD
TO
CLAIM
AS
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
DO
THAT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
BIBLE
ALLOWS
US
TO
DETERMINE
THE
ANSWERS
TO
ALL
QUESTIONS
IS
TO
CLAIM
THAT
WE
HUMANS
CAN
FULLY
UNDERSTAND
GODS
WILL
THIS
IS
HUBRIS
