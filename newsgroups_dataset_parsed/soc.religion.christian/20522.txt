RE
DID
HE
REALLY
RISE
THE
TWO
HISTORIC
FACTS
THAT
I
THINK
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
ARE

IF
JESUS
DIDNT
RISE
FROM
THE

EQUALLY
IMPRESSIVE
IN

TO
CREATE
THE
OBSERVED
AMOUNT
OF
IMPACT
NOBODY
EVER
DISPLAYED
THE
DEAD
BODY
OF
JESUS
EVEN
THOUGH
BOTH
THE
JEWISH
AND
THE
ROMAN
AUTHORITIES
WOULD
HAVE
GAINED
A
LOT
BY
DOING
SO
IT
WOULD
HAVE
DISCREDITED
THE
CHRISTIANS
