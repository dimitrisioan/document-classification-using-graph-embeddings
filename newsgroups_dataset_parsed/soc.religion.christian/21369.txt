RE
CHRISTIANITY
AND
REPEATED
LIVES
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
PRECLUDES
THE
IDEA
OF
REPEATED
LIVES
ON
EARTH
THERE
IS
A
PARAGRAPH
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
WHICH
IN
MY
OPINION
CLEARLY
MAKES
A
POSITIVE
INFERENCE
TO
REINCARNATION
I
DONT
REMEMBER
WHICH
ONE
IT
IS
OFF
OF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
BUT
IT
BASICALLY
GOES
LIKE
THIS
JESUS
IS
TALKING
WITH
THE
APOSTLES
AND
THEY
ASK
HIM
WHY
THE
PHARISEES
SAY
THAT
BEFORE
THE
MESSIAH
CAN
COME
ELIJAH
MUST
FIRST
COME
JESUS
REPLIES
THAT
ELIJAH
HAS
COME
BUT
THEY
DID
NOT
RECOGNIZE
HIM
IT
THEN
SAYS
THAT
THE
APOSTLES
PERCEIVED
THAT
HE
WAS
REFERING
TO
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
THIS
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
CLEARLY
IMPLY
REINCARNATION
CAN
ANYONE
OFFER
A
REASONABLE
ALTERNATIVE
INTERPRETATION
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
INTERESTED
TO
HEAR
IT
