ISLAM
SATANIC
DEAR
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
I
HAD
A
DINNER
LAST
NIGHT
WITH
A
BIBLE
STUDY
GROUP
WHICH
I
AM
IN
WE
HAD
A
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CHRISTIANITY
AND
ISLAM
AND
I
WAS
SHOCKED
TO
HEAR
THAT
OUR
BIBLE
STUDY
TEACHER
SAID
THAT
MOHAMMAD
WAS
INDEED
A
PROPHET
BUT
OF
SATAN
I
SAID
WHAT
I
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
SOME
MOSLEM
FRIENDS
WHO
ARE
SO
KIND
AND
NICE
EVEN
SOMETIMES
I
FEEL
I
WISH
I
COULD
BE
LIKE
THEM
IN
MY
POINT
OF
VIEW
THEY
DONT
SIN
AS
MUCH
AS
I
DO
HOW
COME
IF
THEY
WERE
UNDER
SATAN
THEY
COULD
HAVE
SUCH
PERSONALITIES
TO
TELL
YOU
THE
TRUTH
I
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
ISLAM
BUT
I
KNOW
THAT
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
THE
DAY
OF
JUDGEMENT
NOW
IM
ASKING
YOU
WHAT
YOUR
OPINIONS
ABOUT
ISLAM
AND
ITS
TEACHING
IMPORTANT
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
DISCUSS
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
SAVED
OR
NOT
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
DISCUSS
ABOUT
POLITIC
RELATED
TO
ISLAM
PS
I
POST
THIS
IN
BITLISTSERVCHRISTIA
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
AND
BITLISTSERVCATHOLIC
IN

OUR
LORD

JESUS
LOVES
YOU

LET
ME
START
BY
SAYING
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
RIGHT
NEWSGROUP
FOR
A
DISCUSSION
OF
ISLAM
SINCE
THERES
A
GROUP
FOR
THAT
BUT
I
SUSPECT
THE
POINT
YOUR
TEACHER
WAS
MAKING
WAS
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
ABOUT
ISLAM
INDEED
ITS
GOING
TO
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
SEE
WHAT
HE
WAS
GETTING
AT
WITHIN
YOUR
GROUNDRULES
SINCE
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
NONCHRISTIANS
ARE
SAVED
IS
AT
THE
HEART
OF
IT
THE
CLASSIC
CHRISTIAN
VIEW
WHICH
I
THINK
MOST
PEOPLE
BELIEVED
UNTIL
THE
LAST
CENTURY
OR
SO
WAS
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
AND
OF
COURSE
JUDAISM
WAS
THE
ONLY
RELIGION
FOUNDED
BY
GOD
AND
THAT
ALL
OTHER
RELIGIONS
WORSHIPPED
FALSE
GODS
AND
CAME
FROM
SATAN
THIS
IS
MORE
OR
LESS
A
COROLLARY
OF
ANOTHER
TRADITIONAL
VIEW
THAT
NO
ONE
BUT
CHRISTIANS
AND
POSSIBLY
JEWS
WILL
BE
SAVED
THIS
NEED
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THERES
NO
TRUTH
IN
ANY
OTHER
RELIGION
NOR
THAT
ALL
OF
THEIR
MEMBERS
ARE
INTENTIONALLY
SATANIC
AFTER
ALL
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
AN
EFFECTIVE
SNARE
SATANIC
ALTERNATIVES
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
ATTRACTIVE
THUS
THEY
MIGHT
CONTAIN
ALL
KINDS
OF
TRUTH
WISDOM
AND
SPIRITUAL
INSIGHTS
THEY
WOULD
BE
MISSING
ONLY
ONE
THING
KNOWLEDGE
OF
SALVATION
THROUGH
CHRIST
IF
THIS
IS
THE
BACKGROUND
OF
YOUR
TEACHERS
REMARKS
AND
I
SUSPECT
IT
IS
THAT
MEANS
THAT
A
DISCUSSION
OF
ISLAM
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
RELEVANT
THE
POINT
IS
NOT
THAT
THERES
ANYTHING
INTRINSICALLY
WRONG
WITH
IT
IT
MAY
TEACH
A
FINE
CODE
OF
BEHAVIOR
AND
ITS
PRACTITIONERS
MAY
ALL
BE
WONDERFUL
PEOPLE
BUT
IF
SALVATION
REQUIRES
BEING
A
FOLLOWER
OF
CHRIST
IT
COULD
STILL
BE
A
SATANIC
INVENTION
THIS
IS
A
REASONABLE
DEDUCTION
FROM
THE
CLASSIC
PROTESTANT
POSITION
CHRISTIANITY
SAYS
THAT
SALVATION
ISNT
A
MATTER
OF
BEING
KIND
AND
NICE
THOSE
ARE
GOOD
THINGS
AND
WE
SHOULD
ENCOURAGE
THEM
BUT
NO
ONE
IS
ABLE
TO
DO
THEM
ENOUGH
TO
BE
SAVED
SALVATION
REQUIRES
CHRIST
PLEASE
FORGIVE
ME
FOR
DOING
THIS
IN
PROTESTANT
TERMS
THERES
A
CATHOLIC
EQUIVALENT
TO
THIS
THAT
HAS
SIMILAR
IMPLICATIONS
BUT
IN
DIFFERENT
TERMS
A
RELIGION
MAY
BE
QUITE
ATTRACTIVE
IN
ALL
VISIBLE
WAYS
BUT
IF
IT
DOESNT
HAVE
CHRIST
ITS
LIKE
A
DIET
THAT
CONSISTS
OF
FOOD
THAT
LOOKS
WONDERFUL
TASTES
GREAT
BUT
IS
MISSING
SOME
ESSENTIAL
FOOD
ELEMENT
SO
THAT
YOU
END
UP
DYING
LET
ME
BE
CLEAR
THAT
I
AM
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
ADVOCATING
THIS
POSITION
WHAT
IM
TRYING
TO
DO
IS
AS
USUAL
TO
CLARIFY
ISSUES
INDEED
IT
IS
NOW
RELATIVELY
UNCOMMON
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ALL
OTHER
RELIGIONS
ARE
SATANIC
MOST
CHRISTIANS
REGARD
SUCH
BELIEFS
AS
AN
UNFORTUNATE
VESTIGE
OF
THE
PAST
THIS
IS
PART
OF
A
GENERAL
MOVE
WITHIN
CHRISTIANITY
IN
THE
LAST
CENTURY
OR
SO
TO
A
NONJUDGEMENTAL
GOD
CHRISTIANS
NOW
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
WOULD
ALLOW
ANYBODY
OTHER
THAN
A
REALLY
ROTTEN
PERSON
TO
END
UP
IN
HELL
AND
THEY
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
ENVISION
THAT
REAL
MALIGNANT
SPIRITUAL
FORCES
ARE
AT
WORK
IN
THE
WORLD
DOING
THINGS
LIKE
CREATING
SUPERFICIALLY
ATTRACTIVE
ALTERNATIVES
TO
CHRISTIANITY
WHETHER
THERE
IS
ACTUALLY
A
SOUND
BASIS
FOR
THE
SHIFT
IS
A
DECISION
THAT
PEOPLE
NEED
TO
MAKE
FOR
THEMSELVES
