certainty
of
canonizations
on
friday
may
marty
helgesen
wrote
public
revelation
which
is
the
basis
of
catholic
doctrine
ended
with
the
death
of
st
john
the
last
apostle
nothing
new
can
be
added
every
so
often
the
pope
declares
that
some
departed
christian
is
now
in
heaven
and
may
be
invoked
in
the
public
rites
of
the
church
it
is
my
understanding
that
roman
catholics
believe
that
such
declarations
by
the
pope
are
infallible
i
see
three
possibilities
the
church
has
received
a
public
revelation
since
the
death
of
for
example
joan
of
arc
the
church
was
given
a
list
before
the
death
of
st
john
which
had
joans
name
on
it
there
is
no
public
revelation
about
joan
and
roman
catholics
are
free
to
doubt
that
she
died
in
a
state
of
grace
or
even
that
she
is
a
historical
character
