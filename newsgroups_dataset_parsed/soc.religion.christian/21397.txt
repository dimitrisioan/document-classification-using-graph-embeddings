RE
QUESTION
FROM
AN
AGNOSTIC
HI
DAMON
NO
MATTER
WHAT
SYSTEM
OR
EXPLANATION
OF
CREATION
YOU
WISH
TO
ACCEPT
YOU
ALWAYS
HAVE
TO
START
WITH
ONE
OF
TWO
PREMISES
CREATION
FROM
NOTHING
OR
CREATION
FROM
SOMETHING
THERE
ARE
NO
OTHER
ALTERNATIVES
AND
IF
WE
ACCEPT
ONE
OR
THE
OTHER
OF
THOSE
TWO
PREMISES
THEN
AGAIN
THERE
ARE
TWO
ALTERNATIVES
EITHER
CREATION
WAS
RANDOM
OR
WAS
ACCORDING
TO
SOME
PLAN
IF
IT
WAS
RANDOM
I
AM
UNABLE
TO
ACCEPT
THAT
THE
COMPLEX
NATURE
OF
OUR
WORLD
WITH
INTERRELATED
INTERDEPENDENT
ORGANISMS
AND
CREATURES
COULD
EXIST
AS
THEY
DO
THEREFORE
I
AM
LEFT
WITH
CREATION
UNDER
THE
CONTROL
OF
AN
INTELLIGENCE
CAPABLE
OF
DEVISING
SUCH
A
SCHEME
I
CALL
THAT
INTELLIGENCE
GOD
I
ALSO
PREFER
THE
CREATIO
EX
NIHILO
RATHER
THAN
FROM
CHAOS
AS
IT
IS
CLEANER
THERE
IS
OBVIOUSLY
NO
WAY
TO
PROVE
EITHER
OR
NEITHER
WE
ARE
AND
WE
MUST
HAVE
COME
FROM
SOMEWHERE
CHOOSE
WHATEVER
EXPLANATION
YOU
FEEL
MOST
COMFORTABLE
WITH
DAMON
YOU
ARE
THE
ONE
WHO
HAS
TO
LIVE
WITH
YOUR
CHOICE
