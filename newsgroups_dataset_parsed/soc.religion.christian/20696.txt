RE
DID
HE
REALLY
RISE
ANOTHER
ISSUE
OF
IMPORTANCE
WAS
THE
CRUCIFICATION
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
OR
A
TRAGIC
MISTAKE
I
BELIEVE
IT
WAS
A
TRAGIC
MISTAKE
GODS
WILL
CAN
NEVER
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
THROUGH
THE
DISBELIEF
OF
MAN
JESUS
CAME
TO
THIS
WORLD
TO
BUILD
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
ON
THE
EARTH
HE
DESPERATELY
WANTED
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
TO
ACCEPT
HIM
AS
THE
MESSIAH
IF
THE
CRUCIFICATION
WAS
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
HOW
COULD
JESUS
PRAY
THAT
THIS
CUP
PASS
FROM
HIM
WAS
THIS
OUT
OF
WEAKNESS
NEVER
MANY
MEN
AND
WOMEN
HAVE
GIVEN
THEIR
LIVES
FOR
THEIR
COUNTRY
OR
OTHER
NOBLE
CAUSES
IS
JESUS
LESS
THAN
THESE
NO
HE
IS
NOT
HE
KNEW
THE
CRUCIFICATION
WAS
NOT
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
GODS
WILL
WAS
THAT
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
ACCEPT
JESUS
AS
THE
MESSIAH
AND
THAT
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
BE
ESTABLISHED
ON
THE
EARTH
WITH
JESUS
AS
ITS
HEAD
JUST
LIKE
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
EXPECTED
IF
THIS
HAD
HAPPENED
YEARS
AGO
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
WHAT
KIND
OF
WORLD
WE
WOULD
LIVE
IN
TODAY
IT
WOULD
BE
A
VERY
DIFFERENT
WORLD
AND
THAT
IS
EACTLY
WHAT
GOD
WANTED
MEN
AND
WOMEN
OF
THAT
AGE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
SAVED
BY
FOLLOWING
THE
LIVING
MESSIAH
WHILE
HE
WAS
ON
THE
EARTH
JESUS
COULD
HAVE
ESTABLISHED
A
SINLESS
LINEAGE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
CONTINUED
HIS
REIGN
AFTER
HIS
ASCENSION
TO
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
TO
LIVE
WITH
GOD
NOW
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
ON
THE
EARTH
WILL
HAVE
TO
WAIT
FOR
CHRISTS
RETURN
BUT
WHEN
HE
RETURNS
WILL
HE
BE
RECOGNIZED
AND
WILL
HE
FIND
FAITH
ON
THIS
EARTH
ISNT
IT
ABOUT
TIME
FOR
HIS
RETURN
ITS
BEEN
ALMOST
YEARS
MIKE

SCOTT
OSER
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
MICHAEL
COVINGTON
WRITES
THE
TWO
HISTORIC
FACTS
THAT
I
THINK
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
ARE
THESE
IF
JESUS
DIDNT
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
THEN
HE
MUST
HAVE
DONE
SOMETHING
ELSE
EQUALLY
IMPRESSIVE
IN
ORDER
TO
CREATE
THE
OBSERVED
AMOUNT
OF
IMPACT
NOBODY
EVER
DISPLAYED
THE
DEAD
BODY
OF
JESUS
EVEN
THOUGH
BOTH
THE
JEWISH
AND
THE
ROMAN
AUTHORITIES
WOULD
HAVE
GAINED
A
LOT
BY
DOING
SO
IT
WOULD
HAVE
DISCREDITED
THE
CHRISTIANS
AND
THE
TWO
SIMPLEST
REFUTATIONS
ARE
THESE
WHAT
IMPACT
THE
ONLY
RECORD
OF
IMPACT
COMES
FROM
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
I
HAVE
NO
GUARANTEE
THAT
ITS
BOOKS
ARE
IN
THE
LEAST
ACCURATE
AND
THAT
THE
RECORDED
IMPACT
ACTUALLY
HAPPENED
I
FIND
IT
INTERESTING
THAT
NO
OTHER
CONTEMPORARY
SOURCE
RECORDS
AN
ECLIPSE
AN
EARTHQUAKE
A
TEMPLE
CURTAIN
BEING
TORN
ETC
THE
EARLIEST
WRITTEN
CLAIM
WE
HAVE
OF
JESUS
RESURRECTION
IS
FROM
THE
PAULINE
EPISTLES
NONE
OF
WHICH
WERE
WRITTEN
SOONER
THAN
YEARS
AFTER
THE
SUPPOSED
EVENT
IT
SEEMS
PROBABLE
THAT
NO
ONE
DISPLAYED
THE
BODY
OF
JESUS
BECAUSE
NO
ONE
KNEW
WHERE
IT
WAS
I
PERSONALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
MOST
LIKELY
EXPLANATION
WAS
THAT
THE
BODY
WAS
STOLEN
BY
DISCIPLES
OR
BY
GRAVEROBBERS
DONT
BOTHER
WITH
THE
POINT
ABOUT
THE
GUARDS
IT
ONLY
APPEARS
IN
ONE
GOSPEL
AND
SEEMS
LIKE
EXACTLY
THE
SORT
OF
THING
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
MIGHT
MAKE
UP
IN
ORDER
TO
COUNTER
THE
GRAVEROBBING
CHARGE
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DOES
RECORD
THAT
JEWS
BELIEVED
THE
BODY
HAD
BEEN
STOLEN
IF
THERE
WERE
REALLY
GUARDS
THEY
COULD
NOT
HAVE
EFFECTIVELY
MADE
THIS
CLAIM
AS
THEY
DID
