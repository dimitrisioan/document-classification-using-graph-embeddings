DANIEL
SEGARD
WRITES
THAT
ARGUMENT
WOULD
BE
MORE
COMPELLING
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
FOR
THE
ISHTAR
EGGS
AND
ISHTAR
BUNNIES
WHY
MIX
PAGAN
FERTILITY
SYMBOLS
FROM
THE
WORSHIP
OF
THE
PAGAN
GODDESS
OF
FERTILITY
WITH
BIBLICAL
BELIEF
WHAT
WOULD
REALLY
BE
LOST
IF
ALL
OF
YOU
WERE
TO
JUST
DROP
THE
WORD
EASTER
AND
REPLACE
ALL
SUCH
OCCURANCES
WITH
RESURRECTION
SUNDAY
WOULD
YOU
NOT
SHOW
UP
FOR
SERVICES
IF
THEY
WERE
CALLED
RESURRECTION
SUNDAY
SERVICES
RATHER
THAN
EASTER
SERVICES
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
VIEW
THIS
THE
TRUE
CELEBRATION
IS
EASTER
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
OUR
LORD
THIS
HAS
BEEN
TRUE
FROM
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
WORLD
PAGAN
PRACTICES
ARE
THEN
EITHER
FORESHADOWINGS
OF
THE
TRUE
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
IN
WHICH
DIM
LIGHT
WAS
SHONE
FORTH
SO
THAT
PEOPLE
WOULD
RECOGNIZE
THE
FULL
TRUTH
WHEN
IT
WAS
MANIFESTED
OR
SATANIC
COUNTERFEITS
INTENDED
TO
DECEIVE
US
SO
THAT
WE
WOULD
NOT
RECOGNIZE
THE
TRUTH
WHEN
IT
WAS
MANIFESTED
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THE
SECOND
ARGUMENT
BECAUSE
I
BELIEVE
IN
THE
POWER
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
THE
FULFILLMENT
OF
THE
INCARNATION
AND
OUR
HOPE
EARLIER
OR
PARALLEL
IDEAS
IN
OTHER
RELIGIONS
CLEARLY
ARE
DIM
IMAGES
OF
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
AS
PAUL
STATES
WE
SEE
THROUGH
A
GLASS
DARKLY
SO
DO
OTHERS
IT
SERVES
NO
PURPOSE
ARGUING
ABOUT
WHO
HAS
THE
DARKER
OR
LIGHTER
GLASS
THE
FORESHADOWINGS
ARE
NOT
PERFECT
SO
WHAT
OUR
UNDERSTNDING
OF
GOD
IS
TODAY
IMPERFECT
FOR
WE
ARE
NOT
YET
PERFECTED
THEOSIS
IS
NOT
A
GIFT
SUCH
THAT
WHAM
WERE
PERFECT
