MARY
BLESSED
AMONG
WOMEN
DAVE
BERNARD
WRITES
WHEN
ELIZABETH
GREETED
MARY
WITH
THE
WORDS
BLESSED
ART
THOU
AMONG
WOMEN
LUKE
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THIS
PLACES
MARY
BEYOND
THE
SANCTIFICATION
OF
NORMAL
HUMANITY
BUT
DEBORAH
SAYS
JUDGES
BLESSED
AMONG
WOMEN
SHALL
BE
JAEL
THE
WIFE
OF
HEBER
THE
KENITE
BLESSED
ABOVE
ALL
WOMEN
IN
THE
TENTS
IT
CAN
DOUBTLESS
BE
TAKEN
THAT
JAELS
SLAYING
OF
SISERA
WAS
A
TYPE
OF
MARYS
VICTORY
OVER
SIN
BUT
EVEN
IF
WE
TAKE
DEBORAHS
WORDS
AS
APPLYING
PROPHETICALLY
OR
SYMBOLICALLY
TO
MARY
THEY
MUST
STILL
BE
APPLICABLE
LITERALLY
TO
JAEL
WE
MAY
WELL
TAKE
THEM
TO
MEAN
THAT
GOD
USED
HER
AS
A
PART
OF
HIS
PLAN
FOR
THE
DELIVERANCE
OF
HIS
PEOPLE
AND
THAT
SHE
HAS
THIS
IN
COMMON
WITH
MARY
BUT
WE
HAVE
NO
REASON
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THEY
MEAN
THAT
SHE
WAS
SINLESS
AND
THUS
NO
REASON
TO
TAKE
THE
LIKE
EXPRESSION
APPLIED
TO
MARY
AS
PROOF
THAT
SHE
WAS
SINLESS
