SLEEPING
WITH
ONES
AUNT
THE
LAST
TIME
WE
DISCUSSED
HOMOSEXUALITY
I
ASKED
WHETHER
ANYONE
COULD
IDENTIFY
ANY
OTHER
ACT
BESIDES
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
PROHIBITED
BUT
WHICH
MIGHT
IN
SOME
CIRCUMSTANCES
BRING
NO
APPARENT
HARM
TO
ANYONE
PUT
ANOTHER
WAY
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
IS
THE
ONLY
ACT
THAT
CHRISTIANS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BELIEVE
IS
IMMORAL
SOLELY
ON
THE
BASIS
THAT
GOD
SAYS
IT
IS
WITH
NO
INSIGHT
BEING
OFFERED
AS
TO
WHY
IT
IS
IMMORAL
NO
ONE
COULD
ANSWER
MY
QUESTION
IN
EITHER
FORM
FROM
THE
BIBLE
I
DID
GET
AN
INTERESTING
RESPONSE
BASED
ON
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
THEOLOGY
HOWEVER
I
THINK
NOW
THAT
I
CAN
AT
LEAST
ANSWER
MY
FIRST
QUESTION
LINK
HUDSON
POINTED
ME
TO
IT
IN
HIS
RECENT
COMMENTS
ABOUT
SLEEPING
WITH
ONES
AUNT
INCEST
IS
HELD
TO
BE
IMMORAL
IN
EVERY
SOCIETY
THAT
IS
THERE
ARE
SOME
DEGREES
OF
RELATIONSHIP
WHERE
MARRIAGE
AND
THUS
INTERCOUSE
IS
PROHIBITED
THE
BIBLE
IS
NO
EXCEPTION
THE
TROUBLE
IS
THAT
IT
MAY
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
WHY
A
PARTICULAR
RELATIONSHIP
QUALIFIES
AS
INCESTUOUS
SOCIETIES
DIFFER
AS
TO
HOW
THEY
DEFINE
INCEST
GENETIC
REASONS
ARE
SOMETIMES
OFFERED
BUT
ALL
THE
BIBLICAL
CASES
CANNOT
BE
DEALT
WITH
THAT
WAY
WHY
CANT
A
MAN
SLEEP
WITH
HIS
STEP
MOTHERASSUMING
THAT
HIS
FATHER
IS
DEAD
AND
THAT
HE
HAS
MARRIED
HER
HOW
DOES
THIS
CASE
DIFFER
FROM
THE
DUTY
TO
MARRY
ONES
BROTHERS
CHILDLESS
WIFE
ARE
THESE
TWO
CASES
PARALLEL
DOES
THE
BIBLE
PROHIBIT
SOME
INCESTUOUS
MARRIAGES
AND
HOMOSEXUAL
MARRIAGES
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
PERHAPS
THAT
GOD
KNOWS
THEY
ARE
NOT
GOOD
FOR
US
AND
YET
WE
ARE
INCAPABLE
OF
UNDERSTANDING
WHY
PS
PLEASE
DONT
BOTHER
WRITING
ME
TO
TELL
ME
THAT
I
AM
A
HOMOPHOBE
AS
SOME
DID
LAST
TIME
MY
MIND
IS
NOT
MADE
UP
ON
THESE
QUESTIONS
YOU
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
I
AM
HOMOPHOBIC
OR
NOT
YOU
DONT
KNOW
ME
TO
CALL
ME
OR
ANYONE
ELSE
A
HOMOPHOBE
WITHOUT
KNOWING
THE
PERSON
MAY
BE
AS
MUCH
AN
EXPRESSION
OF
BIGOTRY
AS
SOME
HOMOPHOBIC
