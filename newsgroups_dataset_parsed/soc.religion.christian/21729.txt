when
elizabeth
greeted
mary
elizabeth
said
something
to
the
effect
that
mary
out
of
all
women
was
blessed
if
so
it
appears
that
this
exactly
places
mary
beyond
the
sanctification
of
normal
humanity
the
phrase
is
eulogemene
su

blessed
are
you
among
women
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
is
an
exceptional
or
unique
status
only
that
as
a
woman
mary
was
blessed
adding
the
word
all
is
not
a
fair
reading
of
the
text
there
are
some
good
reasons
for
the
churchs
veneration
of
mary
but
they
cannot
depend
on
this
verse
