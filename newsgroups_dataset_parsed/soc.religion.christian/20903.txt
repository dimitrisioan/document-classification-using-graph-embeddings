RE
TUFF
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
SOMEONE
WRITING
ANONYMOUSLY
ASKS
WOULD
YOU
HAVE
BECOME
A
CHRISTIAN
IF
YOU
HAD
NOT
BEEN
INDOCTRINATED
BY
YOUR
PARENTS
YOU
PROBABLY
NEVER
LEARNED
ABOUT
ANY
OTHER
RELIGION
TO
MAKE
A
COMPARATIVE
STUDY
AND
THEREFORE
I
CLAIM
YOU
ARE
BRAIN
WASHED
I
DID
BECOME
A
CHRISTIAN
WITHOUT
HAVING
BEEN
INDOCTRINATED
BY
MY
PARENTS
AND
HAVING
STUDIED
BUDDHISM
FAIRLY
CAREFULLY
AND
OTHER
RELIGIONS
TO
A
LESSER
DEGREE
I
MADE
A
DECISION
TO
ACCEPT
THE
TRUTHCLAIMS
OF
CHRISTIANITY
AFTER
HAVING
GIVEN
IT
A
LOT
OF
THOUGHT
I
HAVE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
PROCESS
WAS
NOT
PURELY
A
COLD
RATIONAL
ONE
THERE
WAS
A
POWERFUL
EXPERIENTIAL
ELEMENT
AS
WELL
ALSO
MY
CALVINIST
SHOULD
REST
ASSURED
THAT
I
DONT
LAY
ANY
OF
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THE
OUTCOME
MY
CONVERSION
ON
ANYONE
BUT
GOD
IT
TOOK
ME
YEARS
AND
YEARS
FOR
THIS
ALL
TO
HAPPEN
BECAUSE
I
HAD
MANY
OF
THE
OBJECTIONS
THAT
THIS
POSTER
PUTS
FORWARD
I
GREW
UP
IN
THE
SHADOW
OF
GENERIC
AUTHORITARIAN
CONSERVATIVE
DENOMINATION
AND
I
KNEW
THAT
THAT
WASNT
A
WAY
OF
LIFE
THAT
I
COULD
ADOPT
BUT
I
GRADUALLY
LEARNED
NOT
TO
TAR
ALL
OF
CHRISTIANITY
WITH
THE
SAME
BRUSH
AND
REALIZED
QUITE
SUDDENLY
ONE
COLD
WINTER
NIGHT
THAT
I
ACCEPTED
WHAT
I
HAD
HERETOFORE
REJECTED
I
AM
QUITE
CERTAIN
THAT
I
WAS
NOT
BRAINWASHED
