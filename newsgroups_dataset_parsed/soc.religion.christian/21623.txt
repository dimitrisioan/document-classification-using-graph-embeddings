RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
WRITES
BUT
HAVENT
ALL
SINNED
AND
COME
SHORT
OF
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
ROMANS
THOSE
THAT
CITE
THIS
SCRIPTURE
TO
CLAIM
THAT
EVEN
BABES
REQUIRE
BAPTISM
NEGLECT
THAT
SIN
IS
NOT
IMPUTED
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
ROMANS
THEREFORE
UNTIL
SOMEONE
IS
CAPABLE
OF
COMPREHENDING
GODS
LAWS
THEY
ARE
NOT
ACCOUNTABLE
FOR
LIVING
THEM
THEY
ARE
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
LIFE
AND
ARE
NOT
REMOVED
UNTIL
THEY
CAN
MAKE
A
CONSCIOUS
DECISION
TO
DISOBEY
GOD
A
IDLER
IF
BABIES
ARE
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
BAPTISED
THEN
WHY
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
EVER
SAY
SO
IT
NEVER
COMES
RIGHT
AND
SAYS
ONLY
PEOPLE
THAT
KNOW
RIGHT
FROM
WRONG
OR
WHO
ARE
TAUGHT
CAN
BE
BAPTISED
WHAT
CHRIST
DID
SAY
WAS
I
SOLEMLY
ASSURE
YOU
NO
ONE
CAN
ENTER
GODS
KINGDOM
WITHOUT
BEING
BORN
OF
WATER
AND
SPIRIT
DO
NOT
BE
SURPRISED
THAT
I
TELL
YOU
YOU
MUST
ALL
BE
BEGOTTEN
FROM
ABOVE
COULD
THIS
BE
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
IS
BORN
WITH
ORIGINAL
SIN
I
PRESUME
YOU
ARE
QUOTING
JOHN
MY
KING
JAMES
BIBLE
SAYS
EXCEPT
A
MAN
BE
BORN
OF
WATER
AND
OF
THE
SPIRIT
HE
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
JOHN
HERE
MAN
ADULT
HOWEVER
THIS
COULD
BE
A
QUIBBLE
BETWEEN
TRANSLATIONS
WE
CAN
ALSO
ANALYZE
TO
WHOM
THE
LORD
IS
ADDRESSING
MARVEL
NOT
THAT
I
SAID
UNTO
THEE
YE
MUST
BE
BORN
AGAIN
JOHN
HERE
JESUS
IS
CLEARLY
DIRECTING
HIS
REMARKS
TO
NICODEMUS
A
RULER
OF
THE
JEWS
NOT
A
CHILD
WE
CAN
ASK
OURSELVES
WHY
THE
LORD
WOULD
EVEN
INTRODUCE
THE
CONCEPT
OF
SPIRITUAL
REBIRTH
THROUGH
BAPTISM
IF
NEWBORN
BABIES
WERENT
FREE
FROM
SIN
A
IDLER
YUP
IN
JOHN
MAN
IS
NOT
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
A
BETTER
TRANSLATION
IS
NO
ONE
CAN
ENTER
AS
IN
NRSV
OF
COURSE
IN
JESUS
IS
ADDRESSING
THE
PERSON
WHO
CAME
TO
HIM
THERE
ARE
OTHER
PLACES
IN
THE
NT
WHERE
HE
DEALS
WITH
CHILDREN
THEYVE
BEEN
MENTIONED
IN
OTHER
POSTINGS
