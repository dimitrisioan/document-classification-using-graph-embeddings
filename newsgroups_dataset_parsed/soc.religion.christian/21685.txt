RE
MORMON
TEMPLES
DHAMMERSPACIFIC
DAVID
HAMMERSLAG
WRITES
THIS
PARAGRAPH
BROUGHT
TO
MIND
A
QUESTION
HOW
DO
YOU
MORMONS
RECONCILE
THE
IDEA
OF
ETERNAL
MARRIAGE
WITH
CHRISTS
STATEMENT
THAT
IN
THE
RESSURECTION
PEOPLE
WILL
NEITHER
MARRY
NOR
BE
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE
LUKE
CHAPT
HERE
IS
THE
SHORT
ANSWER
BECAUSE
ONLY
CERTAIN
MARRIAGES
ARE
RECORDED
IN
HEAVEN
NOW
FOR
THE
LONG
ANSWER
IN
DOCTRINE
AND
COVENANTS
SECTION
THE
CHAPTER
DISCUSSING
ETERNAL
MARRIAGE
AND
YES
PLURAL
MARRIAGE
THE
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
SEALINGS
UNDER
THE
PRIESTHOOD
AND
OTHER
MARRIAGES
IS
REVEALED
WHEN
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THIS
WORLD
MARRY
OR
ARE
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE
WHEN
THEY
RECEIVE
THE
RESURRECTION
FROM
THE
DEAD
NEITHER
MARRY
NOR
ARE
GIVEN
IN
MARRIAGE
LUKE
JESUS
WAS
SIMPLY
TEACHING
THAT
MARRIAGES
UNTIL
DEATH
DO
YOU
PART
ARE
NOT
IN
FORCE
AFTER
DEATH
HOWEVER
THE
DOCTRINE
AND
COVENANTS
CONTINUES
DESCRIBING
ETERNAL
MARRIAGE
DC
AND
AGAIN
VERILY
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
IF
A
MAN
MARRY
A
WIFE
BY
MY
WORD
WHICH
IS
MY
LAW
AND
BY
THE
NEW
AND
EVERLASTING
COVENANT
AND
IT
IS
SEALED
UNTO
THEM
BY
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
OF
PROMISE
BY
HIM
WHO
IS
ANOINTED
THIS
POWER
AND
THE
KEYS
OF
THIS
PRIESTHOOD
SHORTENED
FOR
BREVITY
AI
AND
SHALL
BE
OF
FULL
FORCE
WHEN
THEY
ARE
OUT
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
THEY
SHALL
PASS
BY
THE
ANGELS
AND
THE
GODS
WHICH
ARE
SET
THERE
TO
THEIR
EXHALTATION
AND
GLORY
IN
ALL
THINGS
AS
HATH
BEEN
SEALED
UPON
THEIR
HEADS
WHICH
GLORY
SHALL
BE
A
FULNESS
AND
A
CONTINUATION
OF
THE
SEEDS
FOREVER
AND
EVER
THE
LORD
TOLD
PETER
WHATSOEVER
THOU
SHALT
BIND
ON
EARTH
SHALL
BE
BOUND
IN
HEAVEN
MATT
DO
YOU
DOUBT
THAT
PETER
WAS
GIVEN
THE
POWER
TO
PERFORM
SEALINGS
PETER
THOUGHT
SO
BECAUSE
HE
TAUGHT
THAT
HUSBANDS
AND
WIVES
WERE
HEIRS
TOGETHER
OF
THE
GRACE
OF
LIFE
PETER
IN
ORDER
TO
OBTAIN
THE
HIGHEST
DEGREE
OF
CELESTIAL
GLORY
A
MAN
MUST
ENTER
INTO
THIS
ORDER
OF
THE
PRIESTHOOD
DC
WHEN
A
MAN
AND
WIFE
ARE
SEALED
THEY
TRULY
BECOME
ONE
FLESH
BECAUSE
THEIR
ETERNAL
INCREASE
DESTINIES
ARE
ENJOINED
COMPLETELY
OUR
FATHER
HAS
AN
ETERNAL
COMPANION
AND
MAYBE
MORE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PLURAL
MARRIAGE
CONDITIONS
OF
THE
LAW
WHO
PARTICIPATED
IN
OUR
CREATION
AND
IS
EQUALLY
CONCERNED
WITH
OUR
PROGRESS
HERE
THERE
IS
NO
SCRIPTURAL
BASIS
FOR
THIS
DOCTRINE
IF
FACT
THE
ONLY
MENTION
OF
OUR
MOTHER
IS
IN
ONE
VERSE
OF
A
HYMN
WRITTEN
EARLY
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
CHURCH
O
MY
FATHER
I
HAD
LEARNED
TO
CALL
THEE
FATHER
THROUGH
THY
SPIRIT
FROM
ON
HIGH
BUT
UNTIL
THE
KEY
OF
KNOWLEDGE
WAS
RESTORED
I
KNEW
NOT
WHY
IN
THE
HEAVNS
ARE
PARENTS
SINGLE
NO
THE
THOUGHT
MAKES
REASON
STARE
TRUTH
IS
REASON
TRUTH
ETERNAL
TELLS
ME
IVE
A
MOTHER
THERE
WHY
DONT
WE
HEAR
MORE
ABOUT
OUR
MOTHER
BECAUSE
OUR
FATHER
PRESIDES
UNDER
PRIESTHOOD
AUTHORITY
WHICH
IS
NOT
A
CALLING
FOR
HER
BECAUSE
WE
DONT
ALL
NECESSARILY
HAVE
THE
SAME
MOTHER
IT
WOULD
BE
CONFUSING
FOR
WORSHIP
BECAUSE
OUR
FATHER
WISHES
TO
WITHHOLD
HER
NAME
AND
TITLES
BECAUSE
OF
HOW
SOME
PEOPLE
DEGRADE
SACRED
THINGS
A
IDLER
