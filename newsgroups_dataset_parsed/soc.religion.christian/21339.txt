RE
SATANIC
TOUNGES
IN
ARTICLE
MARK
ASHLEY
WRITES
I
HAVE
A
SIMPLE
TEST
I
TAKE
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
SPEAK
ONLY
ONE
LANGUAGE
EG
CHINESE
RUSSIAN
GERMAN
ENGLISH
THEN
I
LET
THE
GIFTED
ONE
START
SPEAKING
IN
TOUNGUES
THE
AUDIENCE
SHOULD
UNDERSTAND
THE
GIFTED
ONE
CLEARLY
IN
THEIR
NATIVE
LANGUAGE
HOWEVER
THE
GIFTED
ONE
CAN
ONLY
HEAR
HIMSELF
SPEAKING
IN
HIS
OWN
LANGUAGE
THAT
WOULD
BE
NEAT
BUT
NOWHERE
IN
THE
BIBLE
DOES
IT
SAY
THAT
ONE
WHO
HAS
THE
GIFT
OF
TOUNGES
CAN
DO
THIS
IF
THE
GIFT
OF
TOUNGES
WERE
THE
ABILITY
TO
BE
UNDERSTOOD
BY
EVERYONE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
LANGUAGES
THEY
KNOW
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
NEED
FOR
THE
GIFT
OF
INTERPRETATION
AND
I
CORINTHIANS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
HAD
TO
HAVE
BEEN
WRITTEN
PERHAPS
I
WOULD
BELIEVE
THE
GIFTED
ONES
MORE
IF
THEY
WERE
GLORIFYING
GOD
RATHER
THAN
THEMSELVES
THEN
PERHAPS
WED
WITNESS
A
REAL
MIRACLE
THATS
A
PRETTY
HARSH
ASSUMPTION
TO
MAKE
ABOUT
A
SEVERAL
MILLION
CHRISTIANS
WORLD
WIDE
SURE
THERE
ARE
SOME
WHO
WANT
GLORY
FOR
THEMSELVES
WHO
SPEAK
IN
TOUNGES
JUST
AS
THERE
ARE
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
HAVE
THIS
GIFT
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
LIKE
THIS
IN
THE
CORINTHIAN
CHURCH
ALSO
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
TRUE
GIFT
OR
THAT
ALL
WHO
SPEAK
IN
TOUNGES
DO
IT
FOR
THEIR
OWN
GLORY
IN
THE
SIGHT
OF
MEN
I
WOULD
VENTURE
TO
SAY
THAT
A
LARGE
PERCENTAGE
OF
THOSE
WHO
DO
SPEAK
IN
TOUNGES
DO
SO
MORE
OFTEN
IN
PRIVATE
PRAYER
THAN
IN
PUBLIC
LINK
HUDSON
THERE
WERE
APPARENTLY
THOSE
IN
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
WHO
CLAIMED
THAT
AT
PENTECOST
THE
MIRACLE
WAS
THAT
THE
CROWD
WERE
ALL
GIVEN
THE
ABILITY
TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
APOSTLES
SPEAKING
IN
GREEK
CLH
