RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
IN
ARTICLE
EUGENEBIGELOWEBAYSUNCOM
WRITES
IF
BABIES
ARE
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
BAPTISED
THEN
WHY
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
EVER
SAY
SO
IT
NEVER
COMES
RIGHT
AND
SAYS
ONLY
PEOPLE
THAT
KNOW
RIGHT
FROM
WRONG
OR
WHO
ARE
TAUGHT
CAN
BE
BAPTISED
THIS
IS
NOT
A
VERY
SOUND
ARGUMENT
FOR
BAPTISING
BABIES
IT
ASSUMES
THAT
IF
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
SAY
SPECIFICALLY
THAT
YOU
DONT
NEED
TO
DO
SOMETHING
THEN
THAT
MUST
MEAN
THAT
YOU
DO
NEED
TO
DO
IT
I
KNOW
THERES
A
SPECIFIC
TERM
FOR
THIS
FORM
OF
LOGIC
BUT
IT
ESCAPES
ME
RIGHT
NOW
HOWEVER
IF
IT
WERE
SOUND
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
APPLY
IT
THIS
WAY
IF
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
SPECIFICALLY
SAY
THAT
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
THEN
IT
MUST
BE
OK
WHICH
COINCIDENTALLY
LEADS
PERFECTLY
INTO
A
QUESTION
IVE
OFTEN
PONDERED
THIS
IS
NO
LESS
LOGICAL
THAN
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
IF
SOMETHING
IS
NOT
IN
THE
BIBLE
THEN
IT
MUST
NOT
BE
DONE
BUT
I
DONT
REALLY
THINK
THATS
WHAT
HES
SAYING
ANYWAY
SEE
BELOW
IF
SLAVERY
IS
IMMORAL
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
CAN
I
ASSUME
THAT
EVERYONE
ELSE
IN
THIS
GROUP
DOES
TOO
WHY
DOESNT
JESUS
OR
ANY
OF
THE
APOSTLES
SPEAK
OUT
AGAINST
IT
OWNING
SLAVES
WAS
COMMON
PRACTICE
BACK
THEN
PAUL
SPEAKS
ABOUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
THAT
IS
IMMORAL
HE
APPARENTLY
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THINGS
LIKE
NOT
BEING
A
DRUNKARD
WHY
DOESNT
ANYONE
MENTION
SLAVERY
IF
GODS
MORALS
ARE
ETERNAL
AND
DONT
CHANGE
LIKE
THE
MORALS
OF
SOCIETY
THEN
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
JUST
AS
IMMORAL
THEN
AS
IT
IS
TODAY
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
LETTER
TO
PHILEMON
IN
IT
PAUL
AT
LEAST
HINTS
THAT
A
CERTAIN
SLAVE
BE
RELEASED
ALSO
SLAVERY
IN
THOSE
TIMES
WAS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
TYPE
OF
SLAVERY
WE
HAD
IN
THE
US
I
THINK
A
BETTER
COMPARISON
WOULD
BE
TO
INDENTURED
SERVITUDE
I
DONT
REALLY
WANT
TO
GET
INTO
A
DISCUSSION
ON
SLAVERY
ANYWAY
ALTHOUGH
IT
DOES
DEMONSTRATE
YOUR
POINT
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
RELEVENT
BECAUSE
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
DID
NOT
SAY
THAT
ABSENCE
OF
SPECIFIC
CONDEMENATION
PROVES
SOMETHING
IS
NOT
IMMORAL
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTERS
ASSERTION
HE
IS
NOT
IN
FACT
MAKING
THE
LOGICAL
ERROR
OF
WHICH
YOU
ACCUSE
HIM
HE
STATED
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
BIBLE
DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
BABIES
CANNOT
BE
BAPTIZED
ALSO
WE
KNOW
THAT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THAT
EVERYONE
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
EVERYONE
INCLUDES
INFANTS
UNLESS
THERE
IS
OTHER
SCRIPTURE
TO
THE
CONTRARY
IE
AN
EXCEPTION
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
EXCEPTION
LISTED
IN
THE
BIBLE
WE
MUST
ASSUME
TO
BE
ON
THE
SAFE
SIDE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
MEANS
WHAT
IT
SAYS
THAT
EVERYONE
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
AND
SO
WE
BAPTIZE
INFANTS
TO
SUMMARIZE
YOU
ACCUSED
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
OF
SAYING
IF
SOMETHING
IS
NOT
FORBIDDEN
BY
THE
BIBLE
THEN
THAT
PROVES
IT
IS
OK
IE
IF
SOMETHING
CANNOT
BE
DISPROVEN
IT
IS
TRUE
HE
RATHER
SEEMED
TO
BE
ASSERTING
THAT
SINCE
THE
BIBLE
DOES
NOT
FORBID
YOU
CANNOT
PROVE
USING
THE
BIBLE
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
OK
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
PROVING
WHETHER
OR
NOT
SOMETHING
CAN
BE
PROVEN
OR
DISPROVEN
THERE
ARE
THEORIES
ON
PROVABILITY
IN
THE
FIELD
OF
LOGIC
BY
THE
WAY
AND
ACTUALLY
PROVING
OR
DISPROVING
IT
THE
OTHER
LOGICAL
ERROR
WE
MUST
AVOID
FALLING
INTO
IS
THE
CONVERSE
THAT
IF
SOMETHING
CANNOT
BE
PROVEN
THEN
IT
IS
FALSE
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
ERROR
OF
MANY
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
BELIEVERS
I
THINK
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
CAN
BE
PROVEN
HERE
IS
THAT
ONE
CANNOT
USE
SCRIPTURE
ALONE
TO
PROVE
SOMETHING
EITHER
WAY
ABOUT
INFANT
BAPTISM
ALTHOUGH
THE
EVIDENCE
SEEMS
TO
ME

FAVOR
