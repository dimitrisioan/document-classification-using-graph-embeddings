re
when
are
two
people
married
in
gods
eyes
i
think
it
was
lewis
who
said
that
in
a
wedding
its
the
principals
that
marry
each
other
the
church
and
the
state
are
present
merely
as
witnesses
rob
steele
in
coming
to
understand
anything
mit
lincoln
laboratory
we
are
rejecting
the
facts
as
they
wood
st
are
for
us
in
favour
of
the
facts
lexington
ma
as
they
are
cs
lewis
this
is
not
just
lewis
its
a
summary
of
standard
catholic
theology
however
this
doesnt
mean
that
the
presence
of
those
witnesses
is
optional
except
in
odd
situations
like
the
standard
desert
island
