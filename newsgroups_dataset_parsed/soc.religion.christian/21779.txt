RE
ST
MARIA
GORETTI
AFTER
READING
THIS
STORY
ABOUT
ST
MARIA
GORETTI
POSTED
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
AM
A
BIT
CONFUSED
WHILE
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
HER
DAILY
LIFE
IS
ONE
OF
PROBITY
AND
SANCTITY
I
AM
AFRAID
I
DONT
QUITE
UNDERSTAND
THE
FINAL
EPISODE
OF
HER
LIFE
I
AM
READING
IT
CORRECTLY
SHE
AND
THE
CHURCH
APPARENTLY
FELT
THAT
BEING
RAPED
WAS
A
SIN
ON
HER
PART
ONE
SO
PERFIDIOUS
THAT
SHE
WOULD
RATHER
DIE
THAN
COMMIT
IT
IF
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
IM
AFRAID
THAT
I
DISAGREE
RATHER
STRONGLY
CAN
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
EXPLAIN
THIS
ONE
TO
ME
YOURS
IN
CHRIST
