LET
ME
SUGGEST
THIS
MAYBE
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
ETERNAL
DARIUS
HELL
THEORY
SHOULD
PROVIDE
ALL
THE
BIBLICAL
EVIDENCE
THEY
CAN
DARIUS
FIND
FOR
IT
STAY
AWAY
FROM
HUMAN
THEORIES
AND
ONLY
TAKE
DARIUS
INTO
ACCOUNT
REFERENCES
IN
THE
BIBLE
LIKE
MOST
TOPICS
WEVE
BEEN
THROUGH
THIS
ONE
BEFORE
BUT
HERE
IS
A
GOOD
START
MATTHEW
THEN
THEY
WILL
GO
AWAY
TO
ETERNAL
PUNISHMENT
BUT
THE
RIGHTEOUS
TO
ETERNAL
LIFE
I
MAY
POST
MORE
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
WHEN
I
HAVE
MORE
TIME
IN
ANY
CASE
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
FATE
OF
THE
DAMNED
IS
MOST
UNPLEASANT
AND
TO
BE
AVOIDED

ID
LIKE
TO
SUGGEST
THAT
DISCUSSIONS
BASED
ON
SINGLE
QUOTATIONS
ARE
A
BAD
WAY
TO
PROCEED
THERE
ARE
PASSAGES
CONSISTENT
WITH
EITHER
THEORY
THE
SENSIBLE
WAY
TO
PROCEED
IS
TO
LOOK
AT
THEM
ALL
AND
SEE
IF
WE
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
A
VIEW
THAT
ENCOMPASSES
ALL
OF
THEM
