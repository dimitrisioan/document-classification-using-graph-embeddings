RE
ATHIESTS
AND
HELL
IN
ARTICLE
GERRY
PALO
WRITESBETWEEN
ADAM
AND
EVE
AND
GOLGOTHA
THE
WHOLE
PROCESS
OF
THE
FALL
OF
MAN
OCCURRED
THIS
INVOLVED
A
GRADUAL
DIMMING
OF
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
THE
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
THIS
WAS
PRECISELY
MY
POINT
FROM
A
THEOLOGICAL
BENT
THOSE
WHO
LIVED
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THE
FLOOD
SUCH
AS
NOAH
HAM
HIS
SON
CUSH
AND
HIS
SON
NIMROD
HAD
A
MUCH
STRONGER
APPRECIATION
OF
DIVINE
WRATH
THEY
ALSO
HAD
A
STRONGER
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
TRUE
GOD
IN
FACT
THIS
IMMEDIACY
WAS
A
CAUSE
OF
HARDSHIP
FOR
SOME
SO
MUCH
SO
THAT
ATLAS
WHO
IS
SEEN
WITH
HEAVENS
RESTING
ON
HIS
SHOULDERS
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
MERELY
THE
PHYSICAL
HEAVENS
THAT
HE
IS
LIFTING
IT
IS
TO
PUT
GOD
AND
THE
STRICT
SPIRITUALITY
OF
HIS
LAW
AT
A
DISTANCE
AND
THUS
HE
BECAME
THE
ELEVATOR
OF
THE
HEAVENS
THIS
GOD
MADE
MEN
ABLE
TO
FEEL
AS
IF
HEAVEN
WERE
AFAR
OFF
AND
AS
IF
EITHER
THE
GOD
OF
HEAVEN
COULD
NOT
SEE
THROUGH
THE
DARK
CLOUD
OR
DID
NOT
REGARD
WITH
DISPLEASURE
THE
BREAKERS
OF
HIS
LAWS
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
SEE
THAT
IT
WAS
THAT
WAS
TITLED
EMANCIPATOR
OR
DELIVERER
OR
PHORONEUS
IT
WAS
NIMROD
WHO
INVADED
THE
PATRIARCHAL
SYSTEM
AND
ABRIDGED
THE
LIBERTIES
OF
MANKIND
YET
WAS
WORSHIP
FOR
HAVING
GIVEN
MANY
BENEFITS
HE
WAS
A
DELIVERER
ALL
RIGHT
BUT
NOT
AS
WE
THINK
OF
CHRIST
AS
A
DELIVERER
ONE
DELIVERED
FROM
A
CONSCIOUS
FEELING
OF
GODS
WRATH
THE
OTHER
ACTUALLY
PERFORMED
A
DELIVERY
FROM
GODS
WRATH
AND
IT
IS
UP
TO
US
TO
ACCEPT
IT
AS
TRUE
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
HUMAN
BEINGS
WHO
DIED
BEFORE
CHRIST
IS
AN
EVER
PRESENT
ONE
WITH
CHRISTIANS
I
AM
NOT
READY
TO
CONSIGN
ADAM
OR
ABRAHAM
OR
EVEN
CAIN
TO
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
I
DONT
SEE
THE
PROBLEM
FROM
THE
TIME
OF
ADAM
THOSE
WHO
LOOKED
FORWARD
TO
THE
COMING
ANOINTED
ONE
AND
PUT
THEIR
FAITH
IN
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
WAS
GOD
WHO
WAS
TO
DO
THE
PROVISION
WERE
ACCOUNTED
AS
RIGHTEOUS
BUT
UP
TO
THE
CRUCIFIXION
THEIR
SINS
WERE
ONLY
COVERED
NOT
TAKEN
AWAY
THEREFORE
THE
DISPENSATION
OF
THE
CHURCH
VIEWS
THE
ACCOUNTABILITY
OF
SIN
THE
SAME
BUT
SEE
IT
AS
A
COMPLETED
ACTION
ROMS
MAKES
IT
CLEAR
THAT
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
SALVATION
VIA
FAITH
AND
NOTHING
ELSE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
EXPERIENCE
ETERNITY
IN
A
PASSING
MOMENT
THE
RELATIONSHIP
OF
ETERNITY
TO
DURATION
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
ONE
OF
INDEFINITELY
EXTENDED
CONDITIONS
OF
GREENWICH
MEAN
TIME
I
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
YOURE
TRYING
TO
CONVEY
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
ID
LAY
HOLD
OF
IT
BECAUSE
THE
SCRIPTURES
DO
EQUATE
THE
ETERNALITY
OF
THE
SECOND
DEATH
WITH
THE
ETERNALITY
OF
SAY
THE
CHURCH
RULING
WITH
CHRIST
JN
TELLS
US
WHAT
ETERNAL
LIFE
IS
EXACTLY
AS
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
THAT
IT
IS
MUCH
MORE
THAN
NONCESSATION
OF
CONSCIOUSNESS
IT
WAS
ALSO
A
STANDARD
BELIEF
AMONG
MANY
PEOPLES
THAT
EVEN
THE
RIGHTEOUS
WERE
LOST
IT
DEPENDS
UPON
YOUR
DEF
OF
LOST
THE
ELECT
WERE
LOST
ONLY
IN
TIME
AS
OUTSIDE
OF
TIME
THEY
HAD
BEEN
CHOSEN
FROM
THE
FOUNDATION
OF
THE
WORLD
EXISTENTIALLY
WE
WERE
ALL
BORN
LOST
BUT
THE
RIGHTEOUS
WERE
IN
CHRIST
AND
THEREFORE
NEVER
ASSUREDLY
LOST
IT
WOULD
BE
INTERESTING
TO
SHARE
IN
THE
RESULTS
OF
YOUR
STUDIES
OF
ANCIENT
PEOPLES
IDEAS
OF
LIFE
AFTER
DEATH
MAYBE
THIS
SUMMER
I
COULD
FIND
TIME
TO
PUT
TOGETHER
A
PAPER
ON
IT
I
SIMPLY
HAVE
TO
BUY
MORE
BOOKS
FOR
MYSELF
AND
THESE
OLDER
BOOKS
ARE
VERY
EXPENSIVE
EITHER
THAT
OR
COUNTLESS
TRIPS
TO
THE
ORIENTAL
MUSEUM
MANKIND
FELL
INTO
MIST
AND
DARKNESS
AND
AT
THE
TURNING
POINT
OF
TIME
A
NEW
LIGHT
ENTERED
INTO
THE
WORLD
THE
LIGHT
STILL
GROWS
AND
WE
ARE
DEVELOPING
THE
EYES
WITH
WHICH
TO
SEE
BY
IT
MUCH
NEW
REVELATION
AND
GROWTH
IN
UNDER
STANDING
LIES
BEFORE
US
OUR
NEW
VISION
AND
UNDERSTANDING
IS
STILL
VERY
FEEBLE
BUT
IT
CONTAINS
SOMETHING
NEW
THAT
WILL
GROW
IN
TIME
TO
EMBRACE
THAT
WHICH
IS
OLD
AND
MUCH
MORE
AS
WELL
COULDNT
AGREE
WITH
YOU
MORE
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
SAY
ESCHATOLOGY
IS
CLEARLY
CLEARER
THAN
THAT
OF
SAY
ISAIAH
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
I
WAS
REFERRING
TO
AT
THIS
POINT
I
SHOULD
ACKNOWLEDGE
OPENLY
MY
DEBT
TO
THE
WORK
OF
RUDOLF
STEINER
FOUNDER
OF
ANTHROPOSOPHY
FOR
MANY
INSIGHTS
THAT
HAVE
LED
ME
TO
MY
VIEWS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
THE
WAY
YOU
REFER
TO
IT
AS
DOCTRINE
PUTS
A
MODERN
INTELLECTUAL
COLORING
ON
IT
I
THINK
IT
WAS
MUCH
LESS
ABSTRACT
AND
MUCH
MORE
REAL
AND
SPIRITUALLY
CONCRETE
A
TEACHING
THAT
STRUCK
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
HOME
THAN
OUR
DOCTRINES
OR
TEACHINGS
TODAY
CAN
BE
RECEIVED
NO
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
AS
YOU
HAVE
SAID
THIS
WAS
MY
POINT
I
AM
NOT
SO
READY
TO
ATTRIBUTE
WIDESPREAD
NOTIONS
IN
ANTIQUITY
TO
SIMPLE
DISPERSION
FROM
AN
ORIGINAL
SOURCE
EVEN
IF
THEY
WERE
PASSED
ON
THE
QUESTION
IS
TO
WHAT
EXTENT
DID
THEY
REFLECT
REAL
PERCEPTION
AND
EXPERIENCE
AH
THIS
IS
IT
THIS
IS
THE
BIG
QUESTION
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
SAY
AGAIN
I
THINK
THAT
THE
BEST
LIE
IS
ONE
THAT
HAS
AN
APPRECIABLE
AMOUNT
OF
TRUTH
TO
IT
LOOK
AT
SATANS
TWIST
OF
GODS
WORD
WHEN
HE
COERCED
EVE
THAT
IS
A
VERY
INTERESTING
STUDY
THE
SIMILARITY
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
GREAT
VARIETY
OF
EXPRESSION
OF
THE
DIFFERENT
PEOPLES
IDEAS
OF
THE
TIME
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
DEATH
TESTIFIES
TO
THE
PRESENCE
OF
AN
UNDERLYING
REALITY
YES
THAT
IS
MY
POINT
BUT
IT
IS
A
TWO
EDGED
SWORD
FOR
SOME
DO
NOT
WANT
THE
UNDERLYING
REALITY
TO
BE
REVEALED
THEY
WERE
NOT
KNOWN
AS
MYSTERY
RELIGIONS
FOR
NO
REASON
THERE
WAS
THE
PUBLIC
SIDE
OF
THEM
AND
THERE
WAS
THE
PRIVATE
SIDE
THAT
WAS
SO
PROTECTED
THAT
THE
INITIATES
TO
AN
OATH
OF
DEATH
IF
THEY
REVEALED
THAT
PRIVATE
SIDE
THAT
IS
WHY
IT
IS
SO
HARD
TO
BRING
THEIR
TEACHINGS
TO
LIGHT
THE
MYSTERY
OF
INIQUITY
THAT
WE
FIND
IN
THE
BIBLE
CORRELATES
TO
THIS
I
THINK
THE
PRIMARY
OBJECT
OF
THE
MYSTERIES
WAS
TO
INTRODUCE
PRIVATELY
LITTLE
BY
LITTLE
UNDER
THE
SEAL
OF
SECRECY
AND
SANCTION
OF
OATH
WHAT
IT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SAFE
TO
OPENLY
PROFESS
WAS
THE
TRUE
RELIGION
CASE
IN
POINT
TODAY
MIGHT
BE
THE
MASONS
JUST
A
NOTE
THAT
THEY
TOO
WORSHIPPED
OSIRIS
IN
EGYPT
WHO
CAN
BE
TRACED
TO
NIMROD
THE
HUSBAND
SON
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THERE
IS
ONE
NOTION
FIRMLY
EMBEDDED
IN
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
ORIGINATED
MOST
DEFINITELY
IN
A
PAGAN
SOURCE
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
HUMAN
BEING
CONSISTS
ESSENTIALLY
OF
SOUL
ONLY
AND
THAT
THE
SOUL
IS
CREATED
AT
BIRTH
WAS
CONSCIOUSLY
ADOPTED
FROM
ARISTOTLE
WHOSE
IDEAS
DOMINATED
CHRISTIAN
THOUGHT
FOR
FIFTEEN
HUNDRED
YEARS
AND
STILL
DOES
TODAY
NO
I
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
GERRY
I
KNOW
WHAT
YOURE
ALLUDING
TO
IN
THAT
THE
CHURCH
PRIMARILY
THE
RCC
DID
ENDORSE
ARISTOTELIAN
PHILOSOPHY
INTO
THEIR
WORLDVIEW
BUT
I
WOULD
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
THAT
IT
ORIGINATED
IN
GREECE
IF
YOU
ARE
A
STUDENT
OF
HISTORY
YOU
WILL
COME
TO
SEE
THAT
MUCH
OF
WHAT
GREECE
CAME
TO
EXPOUND
TO
THE
WORLD
AS
THEIR
ORIGINAL
WAS
JUST
AN
ADULTERATION
OF
THAT
WHICH
THEY
HAD
TAKEN
FROM
CONQUERED
COUNTRIES
THE
SOUL
IS
CLEARLY
MENTIONED
AND
DISCUSSED
AT
LENGTH
IN
THE
EGYPTIAN
RELIGIONS
AS
WAS
THE
UNITY
OF
GOD
AND
ALSO
THE
TRINITY
OF
GOD
SEE
IF
YOU
CAN
FIND
WILKINSONS
EGYPTIANS
HE
REALLY
DOES
A
NUMBER
ON
WHAT
THE
GREEKS
DID
TO
WHAT
THEY
PILFERED
FROM
THE
EGYPTIANS
HE
WAS
AT
ONCE
THE
FATHER
OF
MODERN
THOUGHT
AND
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
LIVED
DURING
THAT
DARKENED
TIME
WHEN
THE
PERCEPTION
OF
OUR
ETERNAL
SPIRITUAL
BEING
HAD
GROWN
DIM
IM
NOT
KNOCKING
ARISTOTLE
OR
PLATO
OR
ANY
OTHER
GREEK
THINKER
ITS
JUST
THAT
THERE
IS
NOTHING
NEW
UNDER
THE
SUN
INDEED
I
SHOULD
ALSO
CLARIFY
THAT
I
DO
NOT
DENY
THAT
ETERNAL
IRREVOCABLE
DAMNATION
IS
A
REAL
POSSIBILITY
BUT
THE
NARROW
RANGE
IN
WHICH
WE
CONCEIVE
OF
THE
DECISIVE
MOMENT
IE
AFTER
THE
END
OF
A
SINGLE
EARTHLY
LIFE
IS
NOT
IN
MY
MIND
SUFFICIENT
TO
EMBRACE
THE
REALITY
AND
I
THINK
THAT
IS
WHY
THE
EARLY
CREEDS
WERE
COUCHED
IN
TERMS
THAT
DID
NOT
TRY
TO
SPELL
IT
OUT
EACH
AGE
HAS
ITS
OWN
FOCUS
OF
THEOLOGY
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
STRUGGLED
WITH
THE
TRINITARIAN
FORMULATION
THE
REFORMATION
DEALT
WITH
AUTHORITY
TODAY
ESCHATOLOGY
HAS
HAD
MUCH
STUDY
THE
EARLY
CREEDS
DO
NOT
SPELL
THESE
THINGS
OUT
IN
DETAIL
BECAUSE
THEY
WERENT
THE
TOPIC
OF
CONCERN
THERE
WAS
INSUFFICIENT
WISDOM
ACCUMULATED
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
EXEGETICAL
TOOLS
THAT
WE
HAVE
TODAY
ALSO
EACH
AGE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
AN
AIR
OF
REVELATION
TO
IT
ONE
AGE
HAS
A
WELL
TENDED
AND
CULTIVATED
GARDEN
IN
WHICH
A
PARTICULAR
DOCTRINE
IS
GIVEN
GROWTH
IT
WOULD
BE
NATURAL
FOR
THE
END
OF
TIMES
TO
HAVE
THE
GARDEN
APPROPRIATE
FOR
THE
GROWTH
OF
ESCHATOLOGY
WOULDNT
IT
TANGENTS
NEVER
ENDING
TANGENTS
