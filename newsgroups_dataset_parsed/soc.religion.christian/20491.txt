RE
PROPHETIC
WARNING
TO
NEW
YORK
CITY
REGARDING
DAVID
WILKERSONS
PROPHECIES
WHILE
IM
NOT
REAL
SURE
OF
HIS
CREDIBILITY
I
DO
REMEMBER
A
BOOK
HE
WROTE
CALLED
A
VISION
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
HE
MADE
A
PREDICTION
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO
BOUGHT
GOLD
WOULD
BE
HURT
FINANCIALLY
AT
THE
TIME
GOLD
WAS
UP
TO
ABOUT
NOW
IT
IS
LESS
THAN
HALF
THAT
THIS
PREDICTION
STUCK
IN
MY
MIND
BECAUSE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WHERE
I
WORKED
WERE
BUYING
GOLD
THE
PROBLEM
IS
WE
TEND
TO
REMEMBER
PREDICTIONS
THAT
COME
TRUE
AND
FORGET
ONES
THAT
DIDNT
A
LA
JEAN
DIXON
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
THERE
ANY
OF
HIS
PREDICTIONS
PERHAPS
FROM
THE
BOOK
I
MENTIONED
THAT
CAN
PRETTY
DEFINITELY
BE
SAID
TO
HAVE
NOT
COME
TRUE

PEACE

WAR
BEING
HELL
MAKES
SENSE

SECOND
COMING
