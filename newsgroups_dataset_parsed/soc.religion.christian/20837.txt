BIBLE
UNSUITABLE
FOR
NEW
CHRISTIANS
A
NEW
CHRISTIAN
WROTE
THAT
HE
WAS
NEW
TO
THE
FAITH
AND
LEARNING
ABOUT
IT
BY
READING
THE
BIBLE
OF
COURSE
I
AM
NOT
AT
ALL
SURE
THIS
IS
THE
BEST
PATH
TO
FOLLOW
WHILE
THE
BIBLE
IS
FOR
CHRISTIANS
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
THE
REVELATION
OF
GOD
IS
JESUS
CHRIST
AND
THE
CHIEF
LEGACY
OF
THIS
REVALATION
IS
THE
CHURCH
I
AM
NOT
RECOMMENDING
ANY
ONE
DENOMMINATION
BUT
I
DO
RECOMMEND
FINDING
A
COMFORTABLE
CHRISTIAN
CONGREGATION
IN
WHICH
TO
DEVELOP
YOUR
FAITH
RATHER
THAN
JUST
READING
THE
BIBLE
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THE
BIBLE
SHOULD
NOT
BE
READ
ALTHOUGH
I
WOULD
STICK
TO
THE
GOSPELS
EPISTLES
AND
PSALMS
AND
AVOID
THE
BOOK
OF
REVELATION
ALTOGETHER
UNTIL
YOU
ARE
WITH
FRIENDS
YOU
ARE
COMFORTABLE
WITH
I
AM
SURE
THAT
MISTAKENLY
FERVENT
PROJECTS
TO
READ
THE
ENTIRE
BIBLE
HAVE
FREQUENTLY
BOGGED
DOWN
WITH
A
REMARKABLE
LACK
OF
FERVOUR
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
LEVITICUS
OR
FOR
THE
REALLY
STURDY
SOMEWHERE
IN
CHRONICLES
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
THE
BIBLE
IS
THEIR
TO
ILLUSTRATE
THE
FAITH
OF
CHRISTIANS
BUT
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
THE
TOTALITY
OF
THAT
FAITH
VITAL
BELIEFS
OF
VIRTUALLY
ALL
CHRISTIANS
ARE
SIMPLY
NOT
MENTIONED
THE
TRINITY
THE
DUALITY
OF
NATURES
IN
CHRIST
TYPES
OF
CHURCH
ORGANIZATION
ALL
THESE
BELIEFS
AND
PRACTICES
HAVE
DEVELOPED
FROM
THE
LIVED
EXPERIENCE
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
PEOPLE
AN
EXPERIENCE
LIVED
ONE
HOPES
IN
THE
SPIRIT
AS
SUCH
THE
BIBLE
I
THINK
IS
BETTER
STUDIES
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
A
CONGREGATION
AND
THE
CONTEXT
OF
OTHER
READING
FOLLOWING
UP
ON
A
SUGGESTION
OF
AN
OLD
CONFESSOR
OF
MINE
I
WOULD
EVEN
SUGGEST
THAT
A
GOOD
NOVEL
IS
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
REFLECT
ON
THE
CHRISTIAN
LIFE
MOST
NOVELS
OF
ANY
PROFUNDITY
ARE
ACTUALLY
DISCUSSING
THE
NATURE
OF
GOOD
AND
EVIL
IN
THE
HUMAN
HEART
MY
OWN
INDUCTION
INTO
THE
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
WAS
BROUGHT
ABOUT
AFTER
GRACE
THROUGH
READING
GRAHAM
GREENE
THE
POWER
AND
THE
GLORY
AND
THE
POETRY
OF
GERARD
MANLEY
HOPKINS
I
WOULD
ALSO
RECOMMEND
GRAHAM
GREENES
MONSIGNOR
QUIXOTE
AND
ANY
NOVEL
BY
IRIS
MURDOCH
THE
LAST
IS
NOT
EVEN
A
CHRISTIAN
BUT
SUCH
IS
HER
INSISTENCE
ON
THE
NEED
FOR
THE
GOOD
LIFE
THAT
FRANKLY
I
OFTEN
AM
MORE
UPLIFTED
AND
GOD
DIRECTED
AFTER
READING
HER
THAN
AFTER
READING
MANY
PARTS
OF
THE
BIBLE
AND
THAT
AFTER
ALL
IS
WHAT
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
IS
ALL
ABOUT
LETTING
YOUR
SOUL
AND
YOUR
LIFE
BE
IN
SOME
WAY
DIRECTED
TOWARDS
THE
INFINITE
REPRESENTED
TO
US
BY
THE
PERSON
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
