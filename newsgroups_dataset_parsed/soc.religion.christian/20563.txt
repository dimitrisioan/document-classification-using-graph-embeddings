writes
now
as
to
the
suggestion
that
all
prophecy
tends
to
be
somewhat
cyclical
can
you
elaborate
im
not
exactly
sure
what
you
mean
how
does
the
suggestion
relate
to
isaiahs
prophecy
of
the
birth
of
christ
by
a
virgin
i
dont
see
any
cycles
in
that
prophecy
maybe
cyclical
is
not
the
best
word
another
example
would
be
the
scripture
quoted
of
judas
and
his
bishoprick
let
another
take
another
example
is
something
that
isaiah
said
of
his
disciples
which
is
also
applied
to
christ
in
hebrews
the
children
thou
hast
given
me
how
does
the
preterist
view
account
for
this
phenomenon
ah
doublefulfillment
first
of
all
i
would
say
that
im
not
sure
all
the
prophecies
had
doublefulfillment
eg
the
isaiah
prophecy
i
would
say
that
just
because
this
happens
on
some
occasions
does
not
mean
it
will
occur
always
especially
with
regard
to
nt
prophecies
the
apostles
who
quoted
the
ot
and
applied
those
passages
to
jesus
were
acting
as
divine
messengers
and
giving
the
inerrant
word
of
god
to
the
church
no
one
has
that
authority
today
no
one
has
the
apostolic
authority
to
say
that
suchandsuch
a
prophecy
has
doublefulfillment
if
the
imagry
of
revelation
fits
with
events
of
the
century
it
is
folly
for
us
to
try
and
make
it
apply
to
events
centuries
later
