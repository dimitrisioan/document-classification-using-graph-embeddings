THE

THE
FOLLOWING
IS
A
JUXTAPOSITION
OF
PART
OF
AN

ATTRIBUTED
TO
ST

OF
MILAN
AND
THE

OF
THE
TRADITIONAL

OF

THE
CONCLUSION
FROM
THIS

IS
THAT
THE
CENTRAL

OF
THE
TRADITIONAL
ROMAN
CANON
WAS
ALREADY
FAIRLY
WELL
IN

THAT

IS
LOCALISED
IN

DATED
ABOUT

IT
IS
THE
MOST
ANCIENT
WITNESS
WE
POSSESS
AS
TO
THE
PRINCIPAL
PARTS
OF
THE
ROMAN
CANON
WHICH
ONLY
APPEAR
IN
THE
SACRAMENTARIES
SOME
TIME
AFTER
THE
SEVENTH

THE
QUESTION
AS
TO
WHETHER
THE
ROMAN
CANON
IS
NOT
OLDER
EVEN
THAN
THAT
OF
DE
SACRAMENTIS
IS
DISCUSSED
BY
LITURGIOLOGISTS
MGR
BATIFFOL
IS
OF
THIS
OPINION
BUT
WE
ON
THE
CONTRARY
THINK
THAT
THE
FORMER
BEARS
TRACES
OF
CLOSER
COMPOSITION
OF
A
MORE
CAREFULLY
GUARDED
ORTHODOXY
AND
THAT
CONSEQUENTLY
IT
IS
A
TEXT
CORRECTED
FROM
DE
SACRAMENTIS
WE
SHALL
SEE
IN
STUDYING
THE
LIST
OF
NAMES
IN
THE
MEMENTO
OF
THE
LIVING
AND
THAT
OF
THE
DEAD
THAT
MGR
BATIFFOL
ARGUES
WITH
GOOD
REASON
THAT
HE
CAN
DATE
THESE
FRAGMENTS
FROM
THE
PONTIFICATE
OF
SYMMACHUS
WE
THUS
HAVE
THE
STATE
