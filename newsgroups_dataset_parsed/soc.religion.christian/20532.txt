SM

WRITES
SINCE
THEDAYUPONWHICHMOSTCHRISTIANSCELEBRATETHERESURRECTIONOFJESUS
IS
APPROACHING
I
THOUGHT
I
WOULD
COMMENT
ON
THIS
IN
ARTICLE
DSEGARDNYXCSDUEDU
DANIEL
SEGARD
WRITES
WHAT
IS
THE
OBJECTION
TO
CELEBRATION
OF
EASTER
IT
IS
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
JESUS
I
DONT
RECALL
A
COMMAND
IN
SCRIPTURE
FOR
US
TO
CELEBRATE
THE
RESURRECTION
BUT
IT
IS
THE
SOLE
AND
ONLY
REASON
THAT
WE
ARE
CHRISTIANSHOW
COULD
WE
NOT
CELEBRATE
IT
IF
IT
IS
ONLY
THE
NAME
NOT
QUITE
CORRECT
BIBLICAL
TEACHING
EXPECTS
US
TO
CELEBRATE
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
CHRIST
NOT
ONCE
A
YEAR
BUT
EVERY
TIME
SOMEONE
IS
BAPTIZED
COL
WITH
HIM
IN
BAPTISM
WHEREIN
ALSO
YE
ARE
RISEN
WITH
HIM
THROUGH
THE
FAITH
OF
THE
OPERATION
OF
GOD
WHO
HATH
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD
ROM
WE
ARE
BURIED
WITH
HIM
IN
BAPTISM
INTO
DEATH
THAT
LIKE
AS
CHRIST
WAS
RAISED
UP
FROM
THE
DEAD
BY
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
FATHER
EVEN
SO
WE
ALSO
SHOULD
WALK
IN
NEWNESS
OF
LIFE
THOSE
REALLY
WANT
TO
CELEBRATE
THE
RESURRECTION
SHOULD
BY
FAITH
WALK
IN
NEWNESS
OF
LIFE
AFTER
BAPTISM
IT
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
TO
CELEBRATE
A
PAGAN
GODDESS
IN
THE
PROCESS
SO
AS
WE
SEE
FROM
SCRIPTURE
THOSE
WHO
ARE
OF
ISRAEL
WILL
OBSERVE
THE
DAY
FOREVER
THE
GENTILES
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
MESSIAH
OF
ISRAEL
ARE
WELCOME
TO
OBSERVE
THE
DAY
AS
WELL
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
REQUIRED
OF
THEM
SINCE
THE
ARE
ADOPTED
INTO
THE
COMMONWEALTH
OF
ISRAEL
THE
GENTILES
WHO
ARE
GRAFTED
INTO
THE
COMMONWEALTH
OF
ISRAEL
ARE
ONLY
REQUIRED
TO
OBSERVE
THE
BASIC
COMMANDS
GIVEN
TO
THOSE
WHO
CAME
BEFORE
ABRAM
SEE
ALSO
ACTS
NO
FURTHER
REQUIREMENTS
ARE
PLACED
UPON
THEM
ONCE
THEY
COME
TO
FAITH
IN
MESSIAH
SO
FROM
THIS
I
INFER
THAT
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENT
RULES
FOR
CHRISTIANS
OF
JEWISH
DESCENT
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
THERE
IS
NEITHER
JEW
NOR
GREEK
SLAVE
NOR
FREE
MALE
NOR
FEMALE
FOR
ALL
ARE
ONE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
JEWISH
CHRISTIANSMESSIANICS
MAY
FIND
CERTAIN
FORMS
OF
WORSHIP
AND
CERTAIN
DISCIPLINES
MEANINGFUL
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
CULTURAL
BACKGROUND
BUT
I
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
UNDERSTANDING
THE
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
APPLYING
RULES
OR
COMMANDMENTS
TO
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
JUSTIFIED
BY
GRACE
THROUGH
FAITH
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
PAUL
ANSWERED
YOUR
QUESTION
IN
ROMANS
IN
V
HE
STATED
THAT
THE
ADOPTION
THE
GLORY
THE
COVENANTS
THE
GIVING
OF
THE
LAW
THE
SERVICE
OF
GOD
AND
THE
PROMISES
WERE
GIVEN
TO
THE
ISRAELITES
IT
IS
A
PACKAGE
DEAL
HE
GOES
ON
TO
IDENTIFY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
TRUE
ISRAELITES
VS
MAKES
IT
PLAIN
THAT
THE
TRUE
ISRAELITES
ARE
NOT
THOSE
WHO
ARE
BORN
THAT
WAY
BUT
THOSE
WHO
ACCEPT
THE
PROMISE
OF
GOD
PAUL
CONTINUED
TO
EMPHASIZE
THAT
HE
WAS
AN
ISRAELITE
IN
COR
THEN
IN
GAL
HE
SAYS
THAT
ALL
THOSE
WHO
BELONG
TO
CHRIST
ARE
ABRAHAMS
SEED
AND
HEIRS
TO
ALL
THE
PROMISES
GIVEN
TO
THE
ISRAELITES
THE
PROMISES
COME
WITH
THE
LAW
IT
IS
ALL
OR
NOTHING
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
YOU
ONLY
WANT
TO
DISCARD
ONE
PART
OF
THE
LAW
CERTAINLY
YOU
WOULD
WANT
YOUR
HUSBAND
TO
BE
FAITHFUL
TO
YOU
OR
DO
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
ADULTERY
IS
NO
LONGER
FORBIDDEN
SAME
LAW
BTW
PLEASE
GIVE
A
REFERENCE
FOR
YOUR
STATEMENT
THAT
THE
GENTILES
ARE
ONLY
REQUIRED
TO
OBSERVE
THE
BASIS
COMMANDMANTS
COULD
YOU
LIST
THOSE
PLEASE
ACTS
DEALS
WITH
CIRCUMCISION
AND
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
WHICH
WAS
ADDED

OF
