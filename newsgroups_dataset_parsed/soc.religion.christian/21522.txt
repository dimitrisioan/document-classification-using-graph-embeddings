NEW
THOUGHT
ON
DEUTEROCANONICALS
OFTEN
TIMES
MOST
RECENTLY
ON
THIS
LIST
IN
THE
LAST
FEW
DAYS
IVE
HEARD
THE
PASSAGE
FROM
REVELATION
WHOEVER
ADDS
TO
THE
SACRED
WORDS
OF
THIS
BOOKWHOEVER
REMOVES
WORDS
FROM
THIS
BOOK
USED
AS
AN
ARGUEMENT
AGAINST
THE
DEUTERCANONICAL
BOOKS
I
FEEL
THIS
IS
RIDICULOUS
FOR
TWO
REASONS
THEY
WERENT
ADDED
LATER
BY
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
THEY
WERE
ALWAYS
PART
OF
WHAT
WAS
CONSIDERED
INSPIRED
SCRIPTURE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
DEALT
WITH
IN
PREVIOUS
POSTINGSNO
REASON
TO
REPEAT
THE
INFO
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
THAN
NOT
THAT
WHEN
ST
JOHN
OR
WHOMEVER
WROTE
THE
BOOK
OF
REVELATION
WHAT
WAS
THEN
CONSIDERED
SCRIPTURE
WAS
NOT
THE
SAME
THING
YOU
AND
I
ARE
HOLDING
IN
OUR
HANDS
IF
ONE
TAKES
THE
TRANSLATION
OF
THIS
BOOK
IN
REV
OR
SOMEWHERE
AROUND
THERE
TO
MEAN
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
THEN
ALL
OF
US
ARE
LIKELY
HOLDING
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
IN
VIOLATION
OF
THIS
COMMAND
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
EXACTLY
DATE
THE
SCRIPTURES
EVEN
THE
NT
ONES
THEY
DIDNT
LIKE
TO
DATE
THEIR
LETTERS
I
GUESS
I
REALLY
WISH
I
HAD
MY
BIBLE
WITH
ME
RIGHT
NOW
TO
GET
THE
FACTS
STRAIGHT
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
SEVERAL
OF
THE
NT
LETTERS
CHIEF
AMONG
THEM
PETER
HAVE
THEIR
MOST
LIKELY
DATE
OF
COMPOSITION
IN
THE
EARLY
SECOND
CENTURY
AD
REVELATION
WAS
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
WRITTEN
DURIN
THE
REIGN
OF
DOMITION
SP
AD
THUS
IT
COULD
BE
ARGUES
THAT
WE
ARE
ALL
IN
SIN
IF
WE
ACCEPT
PETER
AS
SCRIPTURE
SINCE
IT
WAS
ADDED
TO
THE
BOOK
AFTER
THE
COMPOSITION
OF
REVELATION
WHEN
WE
ARE
TOLD
TO
ADD
NOTHING
MORE
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
GET
THE
EXACT
DATES
GET
A
COPY
OF
THE
NEW
AMERICAN
BIBLE
ILL
TRY
TO
FOLLOW
THIS
UP
TOMORROW
