A

TWIST
TO

SCROGGS
BELIEVES
THAT
ARSENOKOITAI
IS
A
HELLENISTIC
JEWISH
COINAGE
PERHAPS
INFLUENCED
BY
AWARENESS
OF
RABBINIC
TERMINOLOGY
THE

REPRESENTS
THE
HEBREW
MISKAB
ZABAR
LYING
WITH

YET
HE
BELIEVES
THAT
PAUL
DID
NOT
ORIGINATE
THE
TERM
BUT
BORROWED
IT
FROM
CIRCLES
OF
HELLENISTIC
JEWS
ACQUAINTED
WITH
RABBINIC
DISCUSSIONS
IT
WAS
INVENTED
TO
AVOID
CONTACT
WITH
THE
USUAL
GREEK
TERMINOLOGY
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
SCROGGS
OBSERVES
IT
EXPLAINS
WHY
THE
WORD
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
IN
GRECOROMAN
DISCUSSIONS
OF

AND
WHY
LATER
PATRISTIC
WRITERS
AVOIDED

TAKES
THE

OF
THE

THUS
DIFFERING
FROM
BOSWELLS
LEARNED

YET
SCROGGS
UNDERSTANDS
THE
GENERAL
MEANING
OF

WHO
LIES
WITH

A
VERY
NARROW

ARSENOKOITAI
