arsenokoitai
scroggs
cont
dr
james
deyoung
r
scroggs
robin
scroggs
has
built
upon
the
discussion
of
his
predecessors
and
suggested
a
new
twist
to
the
word
scroggs
believes
that
arsenokoitai
is
a
hellenistic
jewish
coinage
perhaps
influenced
by
awareness
of
rabbinic
terminology
the
term
is
derived
from
lev
where
the
lxx
juxtaposes
the
two
words
arsenos
male
and
koiten
bed
and
represents
the
hebrew
miskab
zabar
lying
with
a
male
yet
he
believes
that
paul
did
not
originate
the
term
but
borrowed
it
from
circles
of
hellenistic
jews
acquainted
with
rabbinic
discussions
it
was
invented
to
avoid
contact
with
the
usual
greek
terminology
if
this
is
true
scroggs
observes
it
explains
why
the
word
does
not
appear
in
grecoroman
discussions
of
pederasty
and
why
later
patristic
writers
avoided
it
it
was
meaningless
to
nativespeaking
greeks
scroggs
takes
the
second
part
as
the
active
word
and
the
first
word
as
the
object
of
the
second
part
thus
differing
from
boswells
learned
discussion
yet
scroggs
understands
the
general
meaning
of
one
who
lies
with
a
male
to
have
a
very
narrow
reference
with
the
preceding
malokoi
i
cor
which
scroggs
interprets
as
the
effeminate
callboy
arsenokoitai
is
the
active
partner
who
keeps
the
malakos
of
the
mistress
or
who
hires
him
on
occasion
to
satisfy
his
sexual
desires
hence
arsenokoitai
does
not
refer
to
homosexuality
in
general
to
female
homosexuality
or
to
the
generic
model
of
pederasty
it
certainly
cannot
refer
to
the
modern
gay
model
he
affirms
this
is
scroggs
interpretation
of
the
term
in
i
tim
also
the
combination
of
pornoi
fornicators
arsenokoitai
and
andrapodistai
slave
dealers
refers
to
male
prostitutes
males
who
lie
with
them
and
slave
dealers
who
procure
them
it
again
refers
to
that
specific
form
of
pederasty
which
consisted
of
the
enslaving
of
boys
as
youths
for
sexual
purposes
and
the
use
of
these
boys
by
adult
males
even
serious
minded
pagan
authors
condemned
this
form
of
pederasty
he
then
uses
these
instances
of
arsenokoitai
in
i
cor
and
i
tim
to
interpret
the
apparently
general
condemnation
of
both
female
and
male
homosexuality
in
rom
consequently
paul
must
have
had
could
only
have
had
pederasty
in
mind
we
cannot
know
what
paul
would
have
said
about
the
contemporary
model
of
adultadult
mutuality
in
same
sex
relation
ships
in
relating
these
terms
to
the
context
and
to
contemporary
ethical
concerns
scroggs
emphasizes
the
point
that
the
specific
items
in
the
list
of
vices
in
i
cor
have
no
deliberate
intended
meaning
in
paul
the
form
and
function
of
the
catalogue
of
vices
are
traditional
and
stereotyped
any
relationship
between
an
individual
item
in
the
list
and
the
context
was
usually
nonexistent
he
concludes
that
paul
does
not
care
about
any
specific
item
in
the
lists
both
on
the
basis
of
the
meaning
of
the
terms
and
of
the
literary
phenomenon
of
a
catalogue
of
vices
scroggs
argues
that
the
scriptures
are
irrelevant
and
provide
no
help
in
the
heated
debate
today
the
model
in
todays
christian
homosexual
community
is
so
different
from
the
model
attacked
by
the
nt
that
biblical
judgments
against
homosexuality
are
not
relevant
to
todays
debate
they
should
no
longer
be
used
in
denominational
discussions
about
homosexuality
should
in
no
way
be
a
weapon
to
justify
refusal
of
ordination
reactions
to
the
new
interpretations
of
arsenokoitai
d
wright
in
more
recent
years
the
positions
of
bailey
boswell
and
scroggs
have
come
under
closer
scrutiny
perhaps
the
most
critical
evaluation
of
boswells
view
is
that
by
david
wright
in
his
thorough
article
wright
points
out
several
shortcomings
of
boswells
treatment
of
arsenokoitai
he
faults
boswell
for
failing
to
cite
or
citing
inaccurately
all
the
references
to
lev
and
in
the
church
fathers
such
as
eusebius
the
apostolic
constitutions
clement
of
alexandria
tertullian
and
origen
boswell
has
not
considered
seriously
enough
the
possibility
that
the
term
derives
either
its
form
or
its
meaning
from
the
leviticus
passages
this
is
significant
for
if
the
term
is
so
derived
it
clearly
refutes
boswells
claim
that
the
first
half
of
the
word
arseno
denotes
not
the
object
but
the
gender
of
the
second
half
koitai
the
lxx
must
mean
a
male
who
sleeps
with
a
male
making
arseno
the
object
wright
also
faults
boswells
claims
regarding
linguistic
features
of
the
term
including
suggested
parallels
though
boswell
claims
that
compounds
with
arseno
employ
it
objectively
and
those
with
arreno
employ
it
as
an
adjective
wright
believes
that
the
difference
between
the
two
is
merely
one
of
dialectical
diversity
no
semantic
import
attaches
to
the
difference
between
the
two
forms
wright
believes
that
in
most
compounds
in
which
the
second
half
is
a
verb
or
has
a
verbal
force
the
first
half
denotes
its
object
and
where
the
second
part
is
substantival
the
first
half
denotes
its
gender
it
is
with
boswells
treatment
of
the
early
church
fathers
that
wright
takes
special
issue
because
the
former
has
failed
to
cite
all
the
sources
for
example
aristides
apology
c
ad
probably
uses
arrenomaneis
androbaten
and
arsenokoitias
all
with
the
same
basic
meaning
of
male
homosexuality
contrary
to
boswells
discussion
boswell
fails
to
cite
hippolytus
refut
omn
haer
and
improperly
cites
eusebius
and
the
syriac
writer
bardensanes
the
latter
uses
syriac
terms
that
are
identical
to
the
syriac
of
i
cor
and
i
tim
next
wright
shows
how
the
early
church
fathers
use
arsenokoitai
in
parallel
with
paidophthoria
referring
to
male
homosexuality
with
teenagers
the
dominant
form
of
male
homosexuality
among
the
greeks
sometimes
this
parallelism
occurs
in
the
threefold
listings
of
moicheia
adultery
porneia
fornication
and
paidophthoria
with
arsenokoitai
replacing
paidophthoris
clement
of
alexandria
in
protr
cites
the
second
table
of
the
ten
commandments
as
you
shall
not
kill
ou
moicheuseis
you
shall
not
commit
adultery
ou
paidophthoreseis
you
shall
not
practice
homosexuality
with
boys
you
shall
not
steal
n
another
occurrence
of
arsenokoitein
commit
homosexuality
exists
in
the
sibylline
oracles
it
may
be
wright
observes
that
the
word
was
coined
by
a
jewish
prechristian
writer
in
a
hellenistic
setting
represented
by
orsib
book
wright
also
discusses
uses
of
arsenokoitai
in
rhetorius
c
who
drew
upon
the
first
century
ad
writer
teucer
in
macarius
c
and
in
john
the
faster
d
the
last
in
particular
bears
the
idea
of
homosexual
intercourse
contrary
to
boswell
wright
next
replies
to
boswells
contention
that
the
term
would
not
be
absent
from
so
much
literature
about
homosexuality
if
that
is
what
it
denoted
wright
points
out
that
it
should
not
be
expected
in
writers
prior
to
the
first
century
ad
since
it
did
not
exist
before
then
that
the
greeks
used
dozens
of
words
and
phrases
to
refer
to
homosexuality
that
some
sources
eg
didache
show
no
acquaintance
with
pauls
letters
or
deliberately
avoid
citing
scripture
and
that
boswell
neglects
citing
several
church
fathers
boswells
treatment
of
chrysostom
in
particular
draws
wrights
attention
boswell
conspicuously
misrepresents
the
witness
of
chrysostom
omitting
references
and
asserting
what
is
patently
untrue
chrysostom
gives
a
long
uncompromising
and
clear
indictment
of
homosexuality
in
his
homily
on
rom
boswell
has
exaggerated
chrysostoms
infrequent
use
of
the
term
wright
observes
that
boswell
has
signally
failed
to
demonstrate
any
us
of
arsenokoites
etc
in
which
it
patently
does
not
denote
male
homosexual
activity
it
is
infrequent
because
of
its
relatively
technical
nature
and
the
availability
of
such
a
term
as
paidophthoria
that
more
clearly
specified
the
prevailing
form
of
male
homosexuality
in
the
grecoroman
world
wright
also
surveys
the
latin
syriac
and
coptic
translations
of
i
tim
and
i
cor
all
three
render
arsenokoitai
with
words
that
reflect
the
meaning
homosexual
ie
they
understand
arseno
as
the
object
of
the
second
half
of
the
word
none
of
these
primary
versions
supports
boswells
limited
conclusion
based
on
them
wright
concludes
his
discussion
with
a
few
observations
about
the
catalogues
of
vices
as
a
literary
form
he
believes
that
such
lists
developed
in
late
judaism
as
hellenistic
jews
wrote
in
clear
condemnation
of
homosexuality
in
the
greek
world
this
paralleled
the
increased
concern
on
the
part
of
moral
philosophers
over
homosexual
indulgence
the
term
came
into
being
under
the
influence
of
the
lxx
so
that
writers
spoke
generally
of
male
activity
with
males
rather
than
specifically
categorized
male
sexual
engagement
with
paides
if
arsenokoitai
and
paidophthoria
were
interchangeable
it
is
because
the
former
encompassed
the
latter
in
summary
wright
seeks
to
show
that
arsenokoitai
is
a
broad
term
meaning
homosexuality
and
arises
with
judaism
the
views
of
boswell
scroggs
and
others
who
limit
the
term
to
active
male
prostitutes
or
pederasty
are
without
significant
support
from
linguistic
and
historical
studies
next
the
questioning
of
wrights
position

william
peterson
after
that
we
get

stuff

include

plato
if
there
is
any
doubt
as
to
the
modern
understanding
of
homosexuality

understood

paul
this
will
certainly
clear
things
up
