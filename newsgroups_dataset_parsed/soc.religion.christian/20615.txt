WRITES
IN

CARALVCARALVAUTOTROLCOM
CAROL
ALVIN
WRITES
ARE
ALL
TRUTHS
ALSO
ABSOLUTES
IS
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
TRUTHS
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTES
IF
THE
ANSWER
TO
EITHER
OF
THESE
QUESTIONS
IS
NO
THEN
PERHAPS
YOU
CAN
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
HOW
YOU
DETERMINE
WHICH
PARTS
OF
SCRIPTURE
ARE
TRUTHS
AND
WHICH
TRUTHS
ARE
ABSOLUTES
THE
ANSWER
TO
BOTH
QUESTIONS
IS
YES
PERHAPS
WE
HAVE
DIFFERENT
DEFINITIONS
OF
ABSOLUTE
THEN
TO
ME
AN
ABSOLUTE
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
CONSTANT
ACROSS
TIME
CULTURE
SITUATIONS
ETC
TRUE
IN
EVERY
INSTANCE
POSSIBLE
DO
YOU
AGREE
WITH
THIS
DEFINITION
I
THINK
YOU
DO
SIMILARLY
ALL
TRUTH
IS
ABSOLUTE
INDEED
A
NONABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IS
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
WHEN
IS
SOMETHING
ABSOLUTE
WHEN
IT
IS
ALWAYS
TRUE
OBVIOUSLY
IF
A
TRUTH
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
TRUE
THEN
WE
HAVE
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
TERMS
YES
I
DO
AGREE
WITH
YOUR
DEFINITION
MY
USE
OF
THE
TERM
ALWAYS
IS
RATHER
DECEPTIVE
I
ADMIT
A
SIMPLE
EXAMPLE
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
SORRY
I
DONT
HAVE
A
BIBLE
AT
WORK
AND
CANT
PROVIDE
A
REFERENCE
WOMEN
ARE
INSTRUCTED
TO
BE
SILENT
AND
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
IN
CHURCH
NOW
THIS
IS
SCRIPTURE
BY
YOUR
DEFINITION
THIS
IS
TRUTH
AND
THEREFORE
ABSOLUTE
HOLD
IT
I
SAID
THAT
ALL
OF
SCRIPTURE
IS
TRUE
HOWEVER
DISCERNING
EXACTLY
WHAT
JESUS
PAUL
AND
COMPANY
WERE
TRYING
TO
SAY
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
SO
EASY
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
PAUL
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
ALL
WOMEN
SHOULD
BEHAVE
THAT
WAY
RATHER
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
THAT
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
AT
THE
TIME
THE
WOMEN
HE
WAS
SPEAKING
TO
WOULD
BEST
AVOID
VOLUBILITY
AND
COVER
THEIR
HEADS
THIS
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
MAINTAINING
A
PROPER
WITNESS
TOWARD
OTHERS
REMEMBER
THAT
ANY
NUMBER
OF
RELATIVISTIC
STATEMENTS
CAN
BE
DERIVED
FROM
ABSOLUTES
FOR
INSTANCE
IT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
STRIVE
FOR
PEACE
HOWEVER
THIS
DOES
NOT
RULE
OUT
TRYING
TO
MAINTAIN
WORLD
PEACE
BY
RESORTING
TO
VIOLENCE
ON
OCCASION
YES
MY
OPINION
EVANGELICALS
ARE
CLEARLY
NOT
TAKING
THIS
PARTICULAR
PART
OF
SCRIPTURE
TO
BE
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AND
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
OTHER
EXAMPLES
CAN
YOU
RECONCILE
THIS
SURE
THE
BIBLE
PREACHES
ABSOLUTE
TRUTHS
HOWEVER
EXACTLY
WHAT
THOSE
TRUTHS
ARE
IS
SOMETIMES
A
MATTER
OF
CONFUSION
AS
I
SAID
THE
BIBLE
DOES
PREACH
ABSOLUTE
TRUTHS
SOMETIMES
THOSE
FUNDAMENTAL
PRINCIPLES
ARE
CRYSTAL
CLEAR
AT
LEAST
TO
EVANGELICALS
SOMETIMES
THEY
ARE
NOT
SO
CLEAR
TO
EVERYONE
EG
SHOULD
BAPTISM
BE
BY
FULL
IMMERSION
OR
NOT
ETC
THAT
IS
LARGELY
BECAUSE
SOMETIMES
IT
IS
NOT
EXPLICITLY
SPELLED
OUT
WHETHER
THE
WRITERS
ARE
SPEAKING
TO
A
PARTICULAR
CULTURE
OR
TO
CHRISTIANITY
AS
A
WHOLE
THIS
IS
WHERE
SCHOLARSHIP
AND
THE
STUDY
OF
BIBLICAL
CONTEXTS
COMES
IN
ITS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
HOW
YOU
CAN
CLAIM
SOMETHING
WHICH
IS
BASED
ON
YOUR
OWN
INTERPRETATION
IS
ABSOLUTE
GOD
REVEALED
HIS
TRUTHS
TO
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
HIS
WORD
IT
IS
UTTERLY
UNAVOIDABLE
HOWEVER
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WHILL
COME
UP
WITH
ALTERNATE
INTERPRETATIONS
PRACTICALLY
ANYTHING
CAN
BE
MISINTERPRETED
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MATTERS
OF
RIGHT
AND
WRONG
CARE
