course
the
whole
issue
is
one
of
discernment
it
may
be
that
satan
is
trying
to
convince
us
that
we
know
more
than
god
or
it
may
be
that
god
is
trying
as
god
did
with
peter
to
teach
us
something
we
dont
know
that
god
shows
no
partiality
but
in
every
nation
anyone
who
fears
him
and
does
what
is
right
is
acceptable
to
him

fine
but
one
of
the
points
of
this
entire
discussion
is
that
we
conservative
reformed
christians
this
could
start
an
argument
but
isnt
this
idea
that
homosexuality
is
ok
fairly
new
this
century
is
there
any
support
for
this
being
a
viable
viewpoint
before
this
century
i
dont
know
dont
believe
that
homosexuality
is
acceptable
to
him
so
your
scripture
quotation
doesnt
work
for
us
