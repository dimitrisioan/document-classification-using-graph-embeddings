CONVERSIONS
ON
IN
ENVIRONMENTALISM
AND
PAGANISM
USER
MICHAEL
WRITES
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
CHRISTIANS
DEVOTE
A
BIT
LESS
EFFORT
TO
BASHING
PAGANISM
AND
MORE
TO
FIGURING
OUT
HOW
TO
PRESENT
THE
GOSPEL
TO
PAGANS
CHRIST
IS
THE
ANSWER
THE
PAGANS
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
THE
RIGHT
QUESTIONS
UNLIKE
MATERIALISTS
WHO
DENY
THE
NEED
FOR
ANY
SPIRITUALITY
AND
WHAT
OF
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
ALREADY
HAVE
ANSWERS
TO
THEIR
QUESTIONS
WITHOUT
TURNING
TO
CHRISTIANITY
OR
IN
MY
CASE
ANY
RELIGION
WHAY
RIGHT
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
PRESUME
TO
LECTURE
ME
ABOUT
WHAT
I
SHOULD
BELIEVE
