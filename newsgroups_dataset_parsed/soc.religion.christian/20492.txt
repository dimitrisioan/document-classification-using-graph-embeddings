RE
PRAYER
IN
JESUS
NAME
MUNNSCAEWISCEDU
SCOTT
MUNNS
WRITES
I
AM
DOING
A
DORMITORY
BIBLE
DISCUSSION
WITH
MY
CHRISTIAN
ROOMMATE
AND
OF
THE
NONCHRISTIAN
GUYS
ON
MY
FLOOR
THEY
ARE
VERY
CLOSE
TO
ACCEPTING
CHRIST
SO
WE
HAVE
STARTED
TO
DISCIPLE
THEM
TREAT
THEM
LIKE
BABY
BELIEVERS
AND
GO
INTO
MORE
INDEPTH
SUBJECTS
THAN
THE
PARABLES
ETC
OUR
FIRST
DISCUSSION
WAS
ON
PRAYER
EVENTUALLY
WE
GOT
AROUND
TO
HOW
WE
SHOULD
PRAY
IN
JESUS
NAME
THEN
AN
EXCELLENT
QUESTION
CAME
UP
ONE
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
A
REAL
ANSWER
TO
THE
QUESTION
WAS
IF
WE
NEED
TO
PRAY
IN
JESUS
NAME
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PEOPLE
BEFORE
JESUS
THEY
PRAYED
TO
GOD
AND
HE
LISTENED
THEN
IN
SPITE
OF
THEIR
SINS
WHY
CANT
IT
BE
THE
SAME
WAY
NOW
ILL
TAKE
A
TRY
AT
THIS
FROM
THE
DISCUSSIONS
I
HAVE
BEEN
IN
AND
FROM
HOW
I
HAVE
INTERPRETED
THE
BIBLE
I
FEEL
THAT
ONE
CAN
PRAY
EITHER
WAY
BUT
REMEMBER
THIS
BEFORE
JESUS
THE
PEOPLE
TALKED
TO
GOD
NO
OTHER
WAY
AND
HE
TALKED
BACK
AUDIBLE
AND
DREAMS
ETC
TODAY
WE
HAVE
THE
BIBLE
TO
KNOW
GODS
WILL
AND
WE
HAVE
HIS
SON
YOU
DIED
FOR
US
HE
WAS
GIVEN
AS
OUR
SAVIOR
AND
WHILE
WE
STILL
DO
THINGS
ACCORDING
TO
GODS
WILL
WE
PRAY
THROUGH
HIS
SON
IN
THE
BIBLE
IT
SAYS
THAT
IF
WE
ARE
NOT
KNOWN
TO
JESUS
WE
ARE
NOT
KNOWN
TO
GOD
SORRY
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
VERSES
WITH
ME
SO
IF
WE
ARE
TO
BE
GRANTED
ETERNAL
LIFE
WE
MUST
PRESENT
OURSELVES
TO
JESUS
FIRST
WHO
WILL
THEN
PRESENT
US
TO
GOD
