WILLIAM
HARGREAVES
WRITES
IM
A
COMMITED
CHRISTIAN
THAT
IS
BATTLING
WITH
A
PROBLEM
I
KNOW
THAT
ROMANS
TALKS
ABOUT
HOW
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
OUR
FAITH
NOT
OUR
DEEDS
YET
HEBREWS
AND
JAMES
SAY
THAT
FAITH
WITHOUT
DEEDS
IS
USELESS
SAYING
YOU
FOOLS
DO
YOU
STILL
THINK
THAT
JUST
BELIEVING
IS
ENOUGH
ACTUALLY
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
IS
ANY
CONFLICT
IF
WE
REALLY
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
THESE
PASSAGES
SAY
FIRST
WHAT
IS
FAITH
IF
YOU
STUDY
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
GREEK
AND
HEBREW
WORDS
SO
TRANSLATED
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THE
WORD
MEANS
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
MERE
BELIEF
FAITH
MEANS
BOTH
TRUST
AND
ACTION
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
PUT
YOUR
BELIEF
INTO
ACTION
IT
SIMPLY
CANNOT
QUALIFY
AS
FAITH
I
THINK
THIS
IS
WHAT
JAMES
MEANS
WHEN
HE
SAYS
THAT
FAITH
WITHOUT
WORKS
IS
DEAD
AND
I
WILL
SHOW
YOU
MY
FAITH
BY
MY
WORKS
REMEMBER
JAMES
WAS
WRITING
TO
THE
TWELVE
TRIBES
WHICH
ARE
SCATTERED
ABROAD
THIS
PROBABLY
MEANS
HE
WAS
WRITING
TO
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
HEAR
THE
GOSPEL
MUCH
LATER
AND
WOULDNT
UNDERSTAND
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
GREEK
INDEED
I
SUSPECT
JAMES
WAS
WRITING
TO
US
TODAY
AMONG
OTHERS
HE
INTENDED
TO
REACH
PAUL
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WROTE
MOSTLY
TO
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
ROMAN
EMPIRE
WHO
GENERALLY
UNDERSTOOD
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
GREEK
ANOTHER
KEY
TO
WHY
THERE
IS
NO
CONFLICT
IS
TO
LOOK
AT
PAULS
STATEMENTS
IN
THEIR
CONTEXT
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
WHEN
PAUL
CONTRASTS
FAITH
AND
WORKS
IT
IS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
COMPARING
THE
GOSPEL
WITH
THE
LAW
MEANING
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
THIS
WAS
THE
GREAT
BURDEN
OF
PAULS
LIFE
AS
THE
APOSTLE
TO
THE
GENTILES
HE
WOULD
GO
CONVERT
A
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
THEN
THE
JUDIZERS
WOULD
COME
ALONG
AND
TRY
TO
CONVINCE
THEM
THAT
THEY
ALSO
HAD
TO
OBEY
THE
LAW
OF
MOSES
CF
ACTS
CHAPTER
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
PAUL
CONDEMNS
THE
IDEA
OF
BEING
SAVED
BY
THE
WORKS
OF
THE
LAW
SAYING
THAT
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
THE
BLOOD
OF
JESUS
AND
OUR
FAITH
IN
HIM
I
BELIEVE
THAT
A
BETTER
TRANSLATION
FOR
TODAY
WOULD
BE
THAT
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
FAITHFULNESS
I
THINK
FAITHFULNESS
TODAY
HAS
A
MEANING
CLOSER
TO
WHAT
THE
ORIGINAL
WRITERS
INTENDED
NOW
IF
SOMEONE
IS
FULLY
BELIEVING
BUT
THERE
LIFE
IS
TOTALLY
LEAD
BY
THEMSELVES
AND
NOT
BY
GOD
ACCORDING
TO
ROMANS
THAT
PERSON
IS
STILL
SAVED
BY
THERE
FAITH
I
THINK
YOU
MISUNDERSTAND
ROMANS
WHAT
PAUL
IS
REALLY
SAYING
IS
THAT
GOD
PREFERS
A
FAITHFUL
GENTILE
WHO
DOES
NOT
KEEP
KOSHER
TO
A
KOSHER
JEW
WHO
FAILS
TO
STAY
FAITHFUL
IN
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
MATTERS
OF
FOLLOWING
THE
LORD
AND
HAVING
CHARITY
TOWARD
HIS
FELLOWS
BUT
THEN
THERE
IS
THE
BIT
WHICH
SAYS
THAT
GOD
PREFERES
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
COLD
TO
HIM
IE
DOESNT
KNOW
HIM
CONDEMNED
SO
A
LUKEWARM
CHRISTIAN
SOMEONE
WHO
KNOWS
AND
BELIEVES
IN
GOD
BUT
DOESNT
MAKE
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
LIVE
BY
THE
BIBLE
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
FAITH
DESCRIBED
ABOVE
YOU
CANNOT
HAVE
REAL
FAITH
AND
BE
LUKEWARM
IF
YOU
KNOW
GOD
BUT
ARE
LUKEWARM
UNFAITHFUL
YOU
ARE
WORSE
OFF
THAN
THE
PERSON
WHO
NEVER
HEARD
OF
HIM
REMEMBER
JESUS
IN
THE
PARABLE
OF
THE
PEARL
OF
GREAT
PRICE
MAT
AND
AGAIN
IN
THE
ONE
ON
THE
TREASURE
HIDDEN
IN
THE
FIELD
MAT
INDICATES
THAT
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GOD
IS
ALL
WE
HAVE
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
IN
GENERAL
INCLUDING
THE
FACT
THAT
PISTIS
HAS
SOME
OF
THE
FORCE
OF
FAITHFUL
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
TAKE
THAT
TOO
FAR
YOU
CAN
END
UP
WITH
SOMETHING
THAT
PAUL
DEFINITELY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
INTENDED
BEING
FAITHFUL
MEANS
FOLLOWING
GOD
IN
ALL
THINGS
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
BEING
FAITHFUL
IS
VERY
CLOSE
TO
SAYING
THAT
WE
ARE
SAVED
BY
COMMITING
NO
SINS
I
ASSUME
THATS
NOT
WHAT
YOU
MEANT
I
HAVE
ALMOST
GIVEN
UP
ON
FINDING
A
SPECIFIC
VERBAL
FORMULA
THAT
COMPLETELY
CAPTURES
THIS
HOWEVER
I
THINK
PAUL
IS
DESCRIBING
WHAT
ID
CALL
A
BASIC
ORIENTATION
INCLUDING
ASPECTS
SUCH
AS
TRUST
AND
COMMITMENT
JESUS
SPEAKS
OF
IT
AS
REBIRTH
WHICH
IMPLIES
A
BASIC
CHANGE
WE
MAY
STILL
DO
THINGS
THAT
ARE
SINFUL
AND
MAY
FAIL
TO
SHOW
THE
NEW
LIFE
IN
CHRIST
IN
MANY
SITUATIONS
WHERE
WE
SHOULD
BUT
IN
ANY
CHRISTIAN
THERE
HAD
BETTER
BE
THE
BASIC
CHANGE
IN
ORIENTATION
THAT
JESUS
CALLS
BEING
BORN
AGAIN
