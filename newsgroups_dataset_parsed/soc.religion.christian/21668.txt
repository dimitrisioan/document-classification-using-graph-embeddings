re
satan
kicked
out
of
heaven
biblical
someone
asked
about
biblical
support
for
the
image
of
satan
as
a
fallen
angel
rev
and
enoch
have
been
cited
clh
there
is
also
a
verse
in
luke
that
says
hejesus
saw
satan
fall
from
heaven
its
something
like
that
i
dont
have
my
bible
in
front
of
me
or
i
would
quote
it
directly
but
its
a
pretty
obvious
reference
to
satans
expulsion
justin
i
believe
the
reference
is
to
luke
the
context
of
the
passage
makes
it
possible
that
jesus
is
referring
to
satan
being
defeated
by
jesus
mission
rather
than
a
previous
fall
from
heaven
