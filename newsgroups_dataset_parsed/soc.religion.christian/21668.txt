RE
SATAN
KICKED
OUT
OF
HEAVEN
BIBLICAL
SOMEONE
ASKED
ABOUT
BIBLICAL
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
IMAGE
OF
SATAN
AS
A
FALLEN
ANGEL
REV
AND
ENOCH
HAVE
BEEN
CITED
CLH
THERE
IS
ALSO
A
VERSE
IN
LUKE
THAT
SAYS
HEJESUS
SAW
SATAN
FALL
FROM
HEAVEN
ITS
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
MY
BIBLE
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
OR
I
WOULD
QUOTE
IT
DIRECTLY
BUT
ITS
A
PRETTY
OBVIOUS
REFERENCE
TO
SATANS
EXPULSION
JUSTIN
I
BELIEVE
THE
REFERENCE
IS
TO
LUKE
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
PASSAGE
MAKES
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
JESUS
IS
REFERRING
TO
SATAN
BEING
DEFEATED
BY
JESUS
MISSION
RATHER
THAN
A
PREVIOUS
FALL
FROM
HEAVEN
