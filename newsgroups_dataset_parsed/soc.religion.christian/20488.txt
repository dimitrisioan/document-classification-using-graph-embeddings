HAVE
COME
ACROSS
WHAT
I
CONSIDER
TO
BE
AN
EXCELLENT
TRACT
IT
IS
A

LENGTHY
FOR
A
POSTING

I
THOUGHT
ID
SHARE
IT
WITH
ALL
OF
YOU
ANYWAY
FEEL
FREE
TO
PASS
IT
ALONG

Q
WHAT
KIND
OF
QUESTION
IS
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
CAN
READ
SEES
SIGNS
TRACTS
BOOKS
AND
BUMPER
STICKERS
THAT
SAY
GOD
LOVES
YOU
ISNT
THAT
TRUE
A
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
GOD
OFFERS
HIS
LOVE
TO
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
AS
WE
READ
IN
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
QUOTED
VERSES
IN
THE
BIBLE
FOR
GOD
SO
LOVED
THE
WORLD
THAT
HE
GAVE
HIS
ONLY
BEGOTTEN
SON
THAT
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVETH
IN
HIM
SHOULD
NOT
PERISH
BUT
HAVE
EVERLASTING
LIFE
JOHN
HOWEVER
GODS
LOVE
IS
QUALIFIED
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THE
WAY
OF
THE
WICKED
IS
AN
ABOMINATION
UNTO
THE
LORD
BUT
HE
LOVETH
HIM
THAT
FOLLOWETH
AFTER
RIGHTEOUSNESS
PROVERBS
FOR
THE
LORD
KNOWETH
THE

OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS

THE

Q
BUT
I
AM
NOT
WICKED
I
AM
A

SURELY
THE
GOOD
I
HAVE
DONE
IN
MY
LIFE

OUTWEIGHS
WHATEVER
BAD
I
HAVE

HOW
CAN
THESE
VERSES
APPLY
TO
ME
A
BY

STANDARD
OF
RIGHTEOUSNESS
EVEN
THE
MOST
MORAL
PERSON
IS
LOOKED
UPON
BY
GOD
AS
A
DESPERATE
SINNER
ON
HIS
WAY
TO
HELL
THE

TEACHES
THAT
NO
ONE
IS
GOOD
ENOUGH
IN
HIMSELF
TO
GO
TO
HEAVEN
ON
THE
CONTRARY
WE
ARE
ALL
SINNERS
AND
WE
ARE
ALL
GUILTY
BEFORE
GOD
AS
IT
IS
WRITTEN
THERE
IS
NONE
RIGHTEOUS
NO
NOT

THERE
IS
NONE
THAT
UNDERSTANDETH
THERE
IS

THE

Q
IF
I
AM
SUCH
A
WICKED
PERSON
IN

SIGHT
WHAT
WILL
GOD
DO
TO

THE

TEACHES
THAT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
WORLD
ALL
THE
WICKED
WILL
COME
UNDER
ETERNAL
PUNISHMENT
IN
A
PLACE
CALLED
HELL
FOR
A
FIRE

SHALL
BURN
UNTO
THE
LOWEST
HELL

SHALL
CONSUME
THE
EARTH
WITH

SET
ON

I
WILL
HEAP
MISCHIEFS

I
WILL

MINE
ARROWS
UPON

THEY
SHALL
BE
BURNT
WITH
HUNGER
AND
DEVOURED
WITH
BURNING

WITH
BITTER
DESTRUCTION

WILL
ALSO
SEND
THE
TEETH
OF
BEASTS
UPON

WITH
THE
POISON
OF

OF
THE
DUST
DEUTERONOMY
Q
OH
COME
ON
NOW
HELL
IS
NOT
REAL
IS
IT
SURELY
THINGS
ARE
NOT
THAT
BAD
A
INDEED
HELL
IS
VERY
REAL
AND
THINGS
ARE
THAT
BAD
FOR
THE
INDIVID
UAL
WHO
DOES
NOT
KNOW
THE
LORD
JESUS
CHRIST
AS
SAVIOR
THE
BIBLE
MAKES
MANY
REFERENCES
TO
HELL
INDICATING
THAT
IT
IS
BOTH
ETERNAL
AND
CONSISTS
OF
PERPETUAL
SUFFERING
AND
WHOSOEVER
WAS
NOT
FOUND
WRITTEN
IN
THE
BOOK
OF
LIFE
WAS
CAST
INTO
THE
LAKE
OF
FIRE
REVELATION
SO
SHALL
IT
BE
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
WORLD
THE
ANGELS
SHALL
COME
FORTH
AND
SEVER
THE
WICKED
FROM
AMONG
THE
JUST
AND
SHALL
CAST
THEM
INTO
THE
FURNACE
OF
FIRE
THERE
SHALL
BE
WAILING
AND
GNASHING
OF

MATTHEW
WHEN
THE
LORD
JESUS
SHALL
BE
REVEALED
FROM

WITH
HIS
MIGHTY
ANGELS

VENGEANCE
ON

WITH
EVERLASTING
DESTRUCTION
FROM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
FROM
THE
GLORY
OF
HIS
POWER
THESSALONIANS
Q
THAT
IS
TERRIBLE
WHY
WOULD
GOD
CREATE
A
HELL
A
HELL
IS
TERRIBLE
AND
IT
EXISTS
BECAUSE
GOD
CREATED
MAN
TO
BE
ACCOUNTABLE
TO
GOD
FOR
HIS
ACTIONS
GODS
PERFECT
JUSTICE
DEMANDS
PAYMENT
FOR
SIN
FOR
THE
WAGES
OF
SIN
IS
DEATH
ROMANS
FOR
WE
MUST
ALL
APPEAR
BEFORE
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
OF
CHRIST
THAT
EVERY
ONE
MAY
RECEIVE
THE
THINGS
DONE
IN
HIS
BODY
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
HE
HATH
DONE
WHETHER
IT
BE
GOOD
OR
BAD
CORINTHIANS
BUT
I
SAY
UNTO
YOU
THAT
EVERY
IDLE
WORD
THAT
MEN
SHALL
SPEAK
THEY
SHALL
GIVE
ACCOUNT
THEREOF
IN
THE
DAY
OF
JUDGMENT
MATTHEW
Q
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
WORLD
EVERYONE
WILL
BE
BROUGHT
TO
LIFE
AGAIN
TO
BE
JUDGED
AND
THEN
TO
BE
SENT
TO
HELL
A
INDEED
IT
DOES
THAT
IS
UNLESS
WE
CAN
FIND
SOMEONE
TO
BE
OUR
SUBSTITUTE
IN
BEARING
THE
PUNISHMENT
OF
ETERNAL
DAMNATION
FOR
OUR
SINS
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
GOD
HIMSELF
WHO
CAME
TO
EARTH
AS
JESUS
CHRIST
TO
BEAR
THE
WRATH
OF
GOD
FOR
ALL
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
ALL
WE
LIKE
SHEEP
HAVE
GONE
ASTRAY
WE
HAVE
TURNED
EVERY
ONE
TO
HIS
OWN
WAY
AND
THE
LORD
HATH
LAID
ON
HIM
THE
INIQUITY
OF
US
ALL
ISAIAH
BUT
HE
WAS
WOUNDED
FOR
OUR
TRANSGRESSIONS
HE
WAS
BRUISED
FOR
OUR
INIQUITIES
THE
CHASTISEMENT
OF
OUR
PEACE
WAS
UPON
HIM
AND
WITH
HIS
STRIPES
WE
ARE
HEALED
ISAIAH
FOR
I
DELIVERED
UNTO
YOU
FIRST
OF
ALL
THAT
WHICH
I
ALSO
RECEIVED
HOW
THAT
CHRIST
DIED
FOR
OUR
SINS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
THAT
HE
WAS
BURIED
AND
THAT
HE
ROSE
AGAIN
THE
THIRD
DAY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SCRIPTURES
CORINTHIANS
FOR
HE
HATH
MADE
HIM
TO
BE
SIN
FOR
US
WHO
KNEW
NO
SIN
THAT
WE
MIGHT
BE
MADE
THE
RIGHTEOUSNESS
OF
GOD
IN
HIM
CORINTHIANS
Q
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
IF
I
TRUST
IN
CHRIST
AS
MY
SUBSTITUTE
WHO
WAS
ALREADY
PUNISHED
FOR
MY
SINS
THEN
I
WILL
NOT
HAVE
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
HELL
ANYMORE
A
YES
THIS
IS
SO
IF
I
HAVE
BELIEVED
IN
CHRIST
AS
MY
SAVIOR
THEN
IT
IS
AS
IF
I
HAVE
ALREADY
STOOD
BEFORE
THE
JUDGMENT
THRONE
OF
GOD
CHRIST
AS
MY
SUBSTITUTE
HAS
ALREADY
PAID
FOR
MY
SINS
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
ON
THE
SON
HATH
EVERLASTING
LIFE
AND
HE
THAT
BELIEVETH
NOT
THE
SON
SHALL
NOT
SEE
LIFE
BUT
THE
WRATH
OF
GOD
ABIDETH
ON
HIM
JOHN
Q
BUT
WHAT
DOES
IT
MEAN
TO
BELIEVE
ON
HIM
IF
I
AGREE
WITH
ALL
THAT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
ABOUT
CHRIST
AS
SAVIOR
THEN
AM
I
SAVED
FROM
GOING
TO
HELL
A
BELIEVING
ON
CHRIST
MEANS
A
WHOLE
LOT
MORE
THAN
AGREEING
IN
OUR
MINDS
WITH
THE
TRUTHS
OF
THE
BIBLE
IT
MEANS
THAT
WE
HANG
OUR
WHOLE
LIVES
ON
HIM
IT
MEANS
THAT
WE
ENTRUST
EVERY
PART
OF
OUR
LIVES
TO
THE
TRUTHS
OF
THE
BIBLE
IT
MEANS
THAT
WE
TURN
AWAY
FROM
OUR
SINS
AND
SERVE
CHRIST
AS
OUR
LORD
NO
MAN
CAN
SERVE
TWO
MASTERS
FOR
EITHER
HE
WILL
HATE
THE
ONE
AND
LOVE
THE
OTHER
OR
ELSE
HE
WILL
HOLD
TO
THE
ONE
AND
DESPISE
THE
OTHER
YE
CANNOT
SERVE
GOD
AND
MAMMON
MATTHEW
REPENT
YE
THEREFORE
AND
BE
CONVERTED
THAT
YOUR
SINS
MAY
BE
BLOTTED
OUT
WHEN
THE
TIMES
OF
REFRESHING
SHALL
COME
FROM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
LORD
ACTS
Q
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
TO
ESCAPE
HELL
EXCEPT
THROUGH
JESUS
WHAT
ABOUT
ALL
THE
OTHER
RELIGIONS
WILL
THEIR
FOLLOWERS
ALSO
GO
TO
HELL
A
YES
INDEED
THEY
CANNOT
ESCAPE
THE
FACT
THAT
GOD
HOLDS
US
ACCOUNT
ABLE
FOR
OUR
SINS
GOD
DEMANDS
THAT
WE
PAY
FOR
OUR
SINS
OTHER
RELIGIONS
CANNOT
PROVIDE
A
SUBSTITUTE
TO
BEAR
THE
SINS
OF
THEIR
FOLLOWERS
CHRIST
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
IS
ABLE
TO
BEAR
OUR
GUILT
AND
SAVE
US
NEITHER
IS
THERE
SALVATION
IN
ANY
OTHER
FOR
THERE
IS
NONE
OTHER
NAME
UNDER

GIVEN
AMONG

WHEREBY
WE
MUST
BE

I
AM
THE

NO
MAN
COMETH
UNTO
THE

BUT
BY
ME
JOHN
IF
WE
CONFESS
OUR
SINS
HE
IS
FAITHFUL
AND
JUST
TO
FORGIVE
US
OUR
SINS
AND
TO
CLEANSE
US
FROM
ALL
UNRIGHTEOUSNESS
JOHN
Q
NOW
I
AM
DESPERATE
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
GO
TO
HELL
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
A
YOU
MUST
REMEMBER
THAT
GOD
IS
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
CAN
HELP
YOU
YOU
MUST
THROW
YOURSELF
ALTOGETHER
ON
THE
MERCIES
OF
GOD
AS
YOU
SEE
YOUR
HOPELESS
CONDITION
AS
A
SINNER
CRY
OUT
TO
GOD
TO
SAVE
YOU
AND
THE
PUBLICAN
STANDING
AFAR
OFF
WOULD
NOT
LIFT
UP
SO
MUCH
AS
HIS
EYES
UNTO
HEAVEN
BUT
SMOTE
UPON
HIS
BREAST
SAYING
GOD
BE
MERCIFUL
TO
ME
A
SINNER
LUKE
SIRS
WHAT
MUST
I
DO
TO
BE
SAVED
AND
THEY
SAID
BELIEVE
ON
THE
LORD
JESUS

AND
THOU
SHALT
BE
SAVED
ACTS
Q
BUT
HOW
CAN
I
BELIEVE
ON
CHRIST
IF
I
KNOW
SO
LITTLE
ABOUT
HIM
A
WONDERFULLY
GOD
NOT
ONLY
SAVES
US
THROUGH
THE
LORD
JESUS
BUT
HE
ALSO
GIVES
US
THE
FAITH
TO
BELIEVE
ON
HIM
YOU
CAN
PRAY
TO
GOD
THAT
HE
WILL
GIVE
YOU
FAITH
IN
JESUS
CHRIST
AS
YOUR
SAVIOR
FOR
BY
GRACE
ARE
YE
SAVED
THROUGH
FAITH
AND
THAT
NOT
OF
YOURSELVES
IT
IS
THE
GIFT
OF
GOD
EPHESIANS
GOD
WORKS
PARTICULARLY
THROUGH
THE
BIBLE
TO
GIVE
US
THAT
FAITH
SO
IF
YOU
REALLY
MEAN
BUSINESS
WITH
GOD
ABOUT
YOUR
SALVATION
YOU
SHOULD
USE
EVERY
OPPORTUNITY
TO
HEAR
AND
STUDY
THE
BIBLE
WHICH
IS
THE
ONLY
WORD
OF
GOD
IN
THIS
BROCHURE
ALL
VERSES
FROM
THE
BIBLE
ARE
WITHIN
INDENTED
PARAGRAPHS
GIVE
HEED
TO
THEM
WITH
ALL
YOUR

SO
THEN
FAITH
COMETH
BY
HEARING
AND
HEARING
BY
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
ROMANS
Q
BUT
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
I
HAVE
TO
SURRENDER
EVERYTHING
TO
GOD
A
YES
GOD
WANTS
US
TO
COME
TO
HIM
IN
TOTAL
HUMILITY
ACKNOWLEDGING
OUR
SINFULNESS
AND
OUR
HELPLESSNESS
TRUSTING
TOTALLY
IN
HIM
THE
SACRIFICES
OF
GOD
ARE
A
BROKEN
SPIRIT
A
BROKEN
AND
A
CONTRITE
HEART
O
GOD
THOU
WILT
NOT
DESPISE
PSALM
BECAUSE
WE
ARE
SINNERS
WE
LOVE
OUR
SINS
THEREFORE
WE
MUST
BEGIN
TO
PRAY
TO
GOD
FOR
AN
INTENSE
HATRED
OF
OUR
SINS
AND
IF
WE
SINCERELY
DESIRE
SALVATION
WE
WILL
ALSO
BEGIN
TO
TURN
FROM
OUR
SINS
AS
GOD
STRENGTHENS
US
WE
KNOW
THAT
OUR
SINS
ARE
SENDING
US
TO
HELL
UNTO
YOU
FIRST
GOD
HAVING
RAISED
UP
HIS
SON
JESUS
SENT
HIM
TO
BLESS
YOU
IN
TURNING
AWAY
EVERY
ONE
OF
YOU
FROM
HIS
INIQUITIES
ACTS
Q
DOESNT
THE
BIBLE
TEACH
THAT
I
MUST
ATTEND
CHURCH
REGULARLY
AND
BE
BAPTIZED
WILL
THESE
SAVE
ME
A
IF
POSSIBLE
WE
SHOULD
DO
THESE
THINGS
BUT
THEY
WILL
NOT
SAVE
US
NO
WORK
OF
ANY
KIND
CAN
SECURE
OUR
SALVATION
SALVATION
IS
GODS
SOVEREIGN
GIFT
OF
GRACE
GIVEN
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
MERCY
AND
GOOD
PLEAS
URE
SALVATION
IS
NOT
OF

LEST
ANY

WHAT
ELSE
WILL
HAPPEN
AT
THE
END
OF
THE

A
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
TRUSTED
IN

THEIR

WILL
BE
TRANSFORMED
INTO

WILL
BE

CONCERNING
THE

THIEF
IN
THE
NIGHT
FOR
THE
UNSAVED
IT
WILL
NOT
COME
AS
A
THIEF
FOR

THERE
IS
MUCH
EVIDENCE
IN

MAY
BE
VERY
VERY
CLOSE
ALL

A
NUMBER

HAVE
BEEN
MADE
TO
ITS
LAYOUT
TO
FACILITATE
COMPUTER
PRINTING
AND

THE
ONLY
CHANGE
TO
THE
TEXT
ITSELF
IS
THE
PARAGRAPH
WHICH
DESCRIBES
THE
WAY
IN
WHICH
BIBLICAL
PASSAGES
APPEAR

IN
THE
ORIGINAL
TRACT
THEY

IN
ITALIC

THEY

HERE
AS
INDENTED
PARAGRAPHS
I
HAVE
READ
MR
CAMPINGS
BOOK
COMPARED
IT
WITH
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
ACTUAL
LY
SAYS
FIND
IT
TO
BE
THE
MOST
CREDIBLE
RESEARCH
WITH
RESPECT
TO
WHAT
THE
FUTURE
HOLDS
THAT
I
HAVE
EVER
COME
ACROSS
AND
AGREE
WITH
HIM
THAT
THERE
IS
JUST
TOO
MUCH
DATA
TO
IGNORE
WHILE
NONE
OF
US
IS
GUARANTEED
ONE
MORE
SECOND
OF
LIFE
AND
WHILE
WE
THEREFORE
SHOULD
TAKE
THESE
MATTERS
VERY
SERIOUSLY
REGARDLESS
OF
WHEN
CHRIST
WILL
ACTUALLY
RETURN
IT
WOULD
APPEAR
THAT
OUR
NATURAL
TENDENCY
TO
POSTPONE
CARING
ABOUT
OUR
ETERNAL
DESTINY
UNTIL
WE
FEEL
THAT
OUR
DEATH
IS
IMMINENT
IS
EVEN
MORE
SENSELESS
NOW
BECAUSE
IN
ALL
LIKELIHOOD
THE
LAW
OF
AVERAGES
WITH
RESPECT
TO
LIFE
EXPECTANCY
NO
LONGER
APPLIES
