RE
PUBLICPRIVATE
REVELATION
FORMERLY
RE
QUESTION
ABOUT
VIRGIN
MARY
MARTY
HELGESEN
WRITES
WHEN
AN
ALLEGED
PRIVATE
REVELATION
ATTRACTS
SUFFICIENT
ATTENTION
THE
CHURCH
MAY
INVESTIGATE
IT
IF
THE
INVESTIGATION
INDICATES
A
LIKELIHOOD
THAT
THE
ALLEGED
PRIVATE
REVELATION
IS
IN
FACT
FROM
GOD
IT
WILL
BE
APPROVED
THAT
MEANS
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
PREACHED
IN
THE
CHURCH
HOWEVER
IT
IS
STILL
TRUE
THAT
NO
ONE
IS
REQUIRED
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
CAME
FROM
GOD
A
CATHOLIC
IS
FREE
TO
DENY
THE
AUTHENTICITY
OF
EVEN
THE
MOST
WELL
ATTESTED
AND
STRONGLY
APPROVED
PRIVATE
REVELATIONS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
AT
FATIMA
AND
LOURDES
I
SUSPECT
THAT
FEW
IF
ANY
CATHOLICS
DO
REJECT
FATIMA
AND
LOURDES
BUT
IF
ANY
DO
THEIR
REJECTION
OF
THEM
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THEY
ARE
NOT
ORTHODOX
CATHOLICS
IN
GOOD
STANDING
IT
MAY
BE
A
BIT
MUCH
TO
SAY
THAT
A
CATHOLIC
IS
FREE
TO
DENY
WHAT
HAPPENED
AT
FATIMA
THATS
A
BIT
STRONG
IT
IS
SORT
OF
LIKE
SAYING
THAT
A
CATHOLIC
IS
FREE
TO
DENY
THAT
HONG
KONG
EXISTS
WHAT
A
CATHOLIC
IS
FREE
TO
DO
IS
TO
DENY
THE
TRUTH
OF
FATIMA
WITHOUT
BEING
CALLED
A
HERETIC
YOU
CAN
BE
LABELED
OTHER
THINGS
FOR
SUCH
AN
OFFENSE
BUT
NOT
A
HERETIC
THEOLOGIANS
MAKE
A
BASIC
DISTINCTION
AS
FAR
AS
THE
DEGREE
OF
ASSENT
ONE
MUST
GIVE
TO
EVENTS
LIKE
FATIMA
AND
LOURDES
THINGS
REVEALED
BY
GOD
THROUGH
JESUS
CHRIST
OR
HIS
APOSTLES
MUST
BE
GIVEN
THE
ASSENT
DUE
TO
A
REVELATION
OF
GOD
TOTAL
AND
UNSWERVING
FATIMA
AND
LOURDES
DEMAND
OUR
ASSENT
AS
MUCH
AS
ANY
OTHER
WELLATTESTED
EVENT
IN
HUMAN
HISTORY
PERHAPS
A
BIT
MORE
GIVEN
THE
APPROVAL
OF
THE
CHURCH
APPROVAL
OF
AN
APPARITION
BY
THE
CHURCH
PRINCIPALLY
MEANS
THAT
WHATEVER
HAPPENED
WAS
IN
HARMONY
WITH
THE
CATHOLIC
FAITH
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
OF
PRIVATE
REVELATIONS
AS
OUR
LORDS
WAY
OF
TELLING
US
WHAT
TO
DO
AT
PARTICULAR
PERIODS
IN
HISTORY
HE
GAVE
US
ALL
THE
DOCTRINES
ETC
YEARS
AGO
BUT
WE
CAN
ALWAYS
USE
SOME
HELP
IN
KNOWING
HOW
EXACTLY
TO
APPLY
WHAT
HE
GAVE
US
CATHOLIC
DEVOTION
TO
THE
SACRED
HEART
WAS
A
RESULT
OF
A
SERIES
OF
APPARITIONS
TO
ST
MARGARET
MARY
ALACOQUE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
PROBLEM
AT
THE
TIME
WAS
EXTREME
MORAL
RIGORISM
THAT
WAS
TURNING
OUR
LORD
INTO
SOMEONE
WITHOUT
A
HEART
THE
FATIMA
APPARITIONS
WERE
A
WARNING
OF
AN
IMPENDING
CRISIS
IN
THE
CHURCH
WE
ARE
LIVING
IT
AND
WHAT
TO
DO
TO
SAVE
THE
MOST
SOULS
POSSIBLE
IN
SUCH
A
SITUATION
