RE
THE
DOCTRINE
OF
ORIGINAL
SIN
REGARDING
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
SIN
CATHOLICS
BELIEVE
THAT
WHAT
ADAM
PRIMARILY
LOST
BY
HIS
SIN
FOR
HIMSELF
AND
THE
HUMAN
RACE
WAS
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
THIS
IS
BASICALLY
A
SHARE
IN
THE
DIVINE
LIFE
TAKE
A
ROCK
AND
MAKE
IT
ABLE
TO
TALK
WHAT
GOD
DOES
TO
A
HUMAN
BEING
THROUGH
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
IS
SIMILAR
IT
MAKES
SUCH
A
ONE
ABLE
TO
LIVE
ON
A
PLANE
THAT
IS
ABOVE
THE
POWERS
OF
ANY
POSSIBLE
CREATURE
THIS
IS
THE
EVERLASTING
LIFE
THAT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
SPEAKS
OF
WHAT
CHRIST
DID
WHEN
HE
CAME
WAS
TO
RESTORE
THIS
LIFE
OF
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
TO
THE
HUMAN
RACE
HE
INSTITUTED
THE
SACRAMENTS
AS
THE
MEANS
BY
WHICH
THIS
LIFE
IS
GIVEN
TO
PEOPLE
AND
ITS
INCREASE
FOSTERED
THE
ABSENCE
OF
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
AT
DEATH
MEANS
AUTOMATIC
EXCLUSION
FROM
HEAVEN
THE
NATURE
OF
HEAVEN
IS
SUCH
THAT
ITS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
A
HUMAN
BEING
TO
HAVE
ANY
PART
IN
IT
WITHOUT
THE
GIFT
OF
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
TO
USE
MY
EXAMPLE
IT
WOULD
BE
LIKE
TAKING
THAT
ROCK
AND
ATTEMPTING
TO
HOLD
A
CONVERSATION
WITH
IT
ROCKS
CANNOT
TALK
NEITHER
CAN
HUMAN
BEINGS
LIVE
IN
HEAVEN
WITHOUT
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
THIS
ALL
OBVIOUSLY
APPLIES
EQUALLY
WELL
TO
INFANTS
OR
ADULTS
SINCE
BOTH
HAVE
SOULS
INFANTS
MUST
BE
BAPTIZED
THEREFORE
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
THEY
TOO
NEED
THIS
FORM
OF
LIFE
IN
THEM
OR
THEY
CANNOT
ENTER
INTO
HEAVEN
TURNING
IT
AROUND
INFANT
BAPTISM
IS
GOOD
SUPPORTING
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
CATHOLIC
BELIEF
IN
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
UNLESS
BAPTISM
CAUSES
SOME
CHANGE
IN
AN
INFANTS
SOUL
THERE
IS
NO
PARTICULAR
REASON
TO
INSIST
ON
THE
PRACTICE
YET
INFANT
BAPTISM
WAS
PROBABLY
PRACTICED
BY
THE
APOSTLES
THEMSELVES
AND
WAS
CERTAINLY
PART
OF
THE
CHURCH
SHORTLY
THEREAFTER
THERE
IS
EVIDENCE
FOR
INFANT
BAPTISM
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
ITSELF
COR
ACTS
ALSO
ACTS
IT
IS
KNOWN
FOR
SURE
THAT
AT
LEAST
ONE
DISCIPLE
OF
THE
APOSTLE
JOHN
WAS
BAPTIZED
AS
AN
INFANT
ST
POLYCARP
BECAUSE
OF
A
REMARK
HE
MAKES
IN
THE
ACTS
OF
HIS
MARTYRDOM
ST
JUSTIN
MARTYR
MENTIONS
MEN
AND
WOMEN
BAPTIZED
AS
INFANTS
THERE
IS
DIRECT
EVIDENCE
IN
ST
IRENAEUSS
AGAINST
HERESIES
AND
IN
TERTULLIANS
ON
BAPTISM
ALL
THESE
SO
FAR
MENTIONED
ARE
IN
THE
FIRST
YEARS
AFTER
OUR
LORDS
DEATH
AFTER
THAT
THERE
STARTS
TO
BE
TONS
OF
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
PRACTICE
