SAMESEX
MARRIAGES
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOME
TALK
RECENTLY
OF
LATIN
RITES
FROM
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
USED
TO
BLESS
SAMESEX
UNIONSIF
ANYONE
HAS
ANY
IDEA
WHERE
COPIES
OF
THESE
RITES
EXIST
IN
WHOLE
OR
IN
PART
PLEASE
NOTIFY
ME
BY
EMAIL
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
SIMILAR
CEREMONIES
WRITTEN
IN
SLAVONIC
EXIST
AS
WELL
LET
ME
KNOW
WHERE
I
CAN
FIND
THESE
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
WHETHER
THE
LATIN
RITE
IS
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
OR
A
TRANSLATION
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
PREFER
TO
HAVE
AN
ENGLISH
VERSION
OF
THE
SLAVON
IC
RITE
IF
IT
EXISTS
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
DOUG
