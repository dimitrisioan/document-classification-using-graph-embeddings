RE
HOMOSEXUALITY
ISSUES
IN
CHRISTIANI
OFM
WRITES
THIS
IS
AN
ISSUE
THROUGHOUT
THE
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
ONE
OF
THE
MAJOR
CHURCHES
IN
CINCINNATI
HAS
BEEN
ORDAINING
HOMOSEXUAL
ELDERS
AND
HAS
IGNORED
PRESBYTERY
INSTRUCTIONS
NOT
TO
DO
SO
AND
THE
CHURCH
IN
ROCHESTER
WHERE
THE
JUDICIAL
COMMISSION
SAID
THEY
COULDNT
INSTALL
A
HOMOSEXUAL
PASTOR
HAS
MADE
HER
AN
EVANGELIST
THESE
SITUATIONS
AS
WELL
AS
THE
ONE
YOU
DESCRIBE
DO
NOT
APPEAR
TO
BE
STABLE
THIS
WILL
CERTAINLY
BE
A
MAJOR
TOPIC
FOR
THE
GENERAL
ASSEMBLY
NEXT
MONTH
IF
THE
CHURCH
CANT
COME
UP
WITH
A
SOLUTION
THAT
WILL
LET
PEOPLE
LIVE
WITH
EACH
OTHER
I
THINK
WERE
END
UP
WITH
A
SPLIT
CLEARLY
NEITHER
SIDE
WANTS
THAT
BUT
I
THINK
WELL
GET
PUSHED
INTO
IT
BY
ACTIONS
OF
BOTH
SIDES
CLH
THE
MODERATOR
OF
THE
GENERAL
ASSEMBLY
THE
REV
JOHN
FIFE
VISITED
OUR
CHURCH
ABOUT
A
WEEK
AGO
JUST
DAYS
AFTER
REV
SPAHRITS
BEEN
A
BUSY
WEEK
FOR
OUR
SMALL
CHURCH
HE
WAS
ASKED
SPECIFICALLY
ABOUT
THE
ISSUE
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
WHAT
HE
THINKS
WILL
HAPPEN
AT
THE
GA
MEETING
NEXT
MONTH
EVIDENTLY
THERE
ARE
KNOWN
RESOLUTIONS
PENDING
THAT
RANGE
THE
GAMUT
FROM
OUTLAWING
HOMOSEXUALITY
ALTOGETHER
TO
LEGALIZING
IT
COMPLETELY
HE
WILL
READILY
ADMIT
THAT
THIS
IS
PROBABALY
THE
MOST
DIFFICULT
ISSUE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
HAS
HAD
TO
DEAL
WITH
SINCE
THE
PRESBYTERIAN
CHURCH
SPLIT
IN
TWO
OVER
THE
ISSUE
OF
SLAVERY
MORE
THAN
YEARS
AGO
WITHOUT
QUESTION
THE
ISSUE
MAY
SPLIT
THE
CHURCH
AGAIN
AFTER
WEVE
BEEN
REUNITED
FOR
ALL
OF
A
DOZEN
YEARS
OR
SO
HE
IS
HOPEFUL
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
AND
IS
PUSHING
THE
SAME
ATTITUDE
THAT
HELPED
THE
CHURCH
DEAL
WITH
THE
ABORTION
ISSUE
LAST
YEAR
AS
A
SOLUTION
HE
IS
HOPING
TO
PASS
A
RESOLUTION
THAT
MORE
OR
LESS
STATES
THAT
WE
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
CHURCH
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
ON
THE
ISSUE
ADMITTING
THAT
BOTH
SIDES
HAVE
HONESTLY
STUDIED
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
HAD
THE
SPIRIT
LEAD
THEM
TO
DIFFERENT
CONCLUSIONS
IT
WORKED
LAST
YEAR
WHEN
THE
ABORTION
ISSUE
THREATENED
TO
DO
MORE
OR
LESS
THE
SAME
THING
AND
HE
IS
HOPEFUL
THAT
THE
GA
CAN
FOSTER
A
LOVING
AND
CARING
ATTITUDE
ABOUT
PEOPLE
WHO
DISAGREE
WITH
THEIR
OWN
VIEW
CLIFF
SLAUGHTERBECK
DEPT
OF
PHYSICS
ITS
TIME
FOR
THE
SERMON
ON
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
WASHINGTON
GRAND
TORINO
SEATTLE
WA
ITS
GOING
TO
BE
HARD
TO
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
IF
WE
ALLOW
DISAGREEMENT
THEN
SOME
PRESBYTERIES
AND
CHURCHES
ARE
GOING
TO
ORDAIN
PEOPLE
THAT
OTHERS
WILL
NOT
RECOGNIZE
THATS
A
DIFFICULT
SITUATION
IN
A
CONNECTIONAL
CHURCH
I
COULD
LIVE
WITH
IT
BUT
I
THINK
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WOULD
NOT
BE
WILLING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
WAS
NOT
WILLING
TO
LIVE
WITH
THIS
KIND
OF
COMPROMISE
WITH
ORDINATION
OF
WOMEN
THE
ONE
THING
THAT
WILL
DEFINITELY
PREVENT
A
PERSON
FROM
BECOMING
A
PRESBYTERIAN
MINISTER
IS
IF
THEY
INDICATE
THAT
THEY
DONT
ACCEPT
ORDINATION
OF
WOMEN
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
WE
CANT
HAVE
HALF
THE
CHURCH
NOT
ACCEPTING
THE
LEADERS
OF
THE
OTHER
HALF
MAYBE
PEOPLE
WILL
DECIDE
TO
LIVE
WITH
IT
IN
THIS
CASE
WHEN
THEY
DIDNT
IN
THE
OTHER
BUT
I
WONDER
I
ADMIT
THAT
MY
OWN
PRESBYTERY
SUBMITTED
AN
OVERTURE
TO
THE
GA
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
EXACTLY
THIS
EFFECT
AND
WE
CONSIDERED
THE
AMBIGUITY
BETTER
THAN
THE
CURRENT
SITUATION
