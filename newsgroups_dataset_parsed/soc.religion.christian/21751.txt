THE
CATHOLIC
DOCTRINE
OF
PREDESTINATION
DOES
NOT
EXCLUDE
FREE
WILL
IN
ANY
WAY
SINCE
GOD
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
HE
THEREFORE
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
THAT
IS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
TO
US
WE
HAVE
FREE
WILL
AND
ARE
ABLE
TO
CHANGE
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
US
HOWEVER
SINCE
GOD
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
HE
KNOWS
ALL
THE
CHOICES
WE
WILL
MAKE
IN
ADVANCE
GOD
IS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
TIME
TOO
OFTEN
ARGUMENTS
PIT
PREDESTINATION
AGAINST
FREE
WILL
WE
BELIEVE
IN
BOTH
CURIOUSLY
ENOUGH
THIS
SUBJECT
HAS
OCCUPIED
A
GOOD
BIT
OF
MY
PRAYER
LIFE
RECENTLY
GODS
EXPERIENCE
OF
TIME
IS
SO
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
FROM
OUR
OWN
SINCE
HE
IS
BOTH
WITHIN
AND
WITHOUT
IT
USING
WORDS
LIKE
FOREKNOWLEDGE
AND
PREDESTINATION
ARE
SEMANTICALLY
INCORRECT
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
DESCRIBING
GODS
PERCEPTION
OF
OUR
ACTION
BECAUSE
FOR
GOD
THE
BEGINNING
LIVING
AND
ENDING
OF
OUR
LIVES
ARE
ALL
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
FOR
GOD
THERE
IS
NO
BEFORE
WHEN
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
SO
HE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
FOREKNOWLEDGE
OF
OUR
LIVES
OR
A
TIME
WHEN
HE
COULD
HAVE
PREDESTINED
OUR
ACTIONS
IN
FACT
SINCE
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THINGS
IS
SO
TIED
TO
OUR
LINEAR
EXPERIENCE
OF
TIME
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
US
TO
UNDERSTAND
COMPLETELY
HOW
OUR
FREE
WILL
INTERACTS
WITH
GODS
CONTROL
OF
THE
UNIVERSE
