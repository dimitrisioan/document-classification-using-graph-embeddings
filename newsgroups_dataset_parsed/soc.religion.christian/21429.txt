MORMON
TEMPLES
IN

JWINDLEYCHEAPCSUTAHEDU
JAY
WINDLEY
WRITES
THERE
ARE
OTHER
INTERPRETATIONS
TO
CHRISTIAN
HISTORY
IN
THIS
MATTER
ONE
MUST
RECALL
THAT
MOST
OF
WHAT
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
GNOSTICS
WAS
WRITTEN
BY
THEIR
ENEMIES
EUSEBIUS
CLAIMS
THAT
JESUS
IMPARTED
SECRET
INFORMATION
TO
PETER
JAMES
AND
JOHN
AFTER
HIS
RESURRECTION
AND
THAT
THOSE
APOSTLES
TRANSMITTED
THAT
INFORMATION
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
TWELVE
EUSEBIUS
HISTORIA
ECCLESIASTICA
II
THIS
IS
CURIOUS
I
READ
IN
EH
THE
LORD
IMPARTED
THE
GIFT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
TO
JAMES
THE
JUST
TO
JOHN
AND
PETER
AFTER
HIS
RESURRECTION
THESE
DELIVERED
IT
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE
APOSTLES
AND
THEY
TO
THE
SEVENTY
OF
WHOM
BARNABAS
WAS
ONE
EUSEBIUS
ECCLESIASTICAL
HISTORY
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
LORD
IMPARTED
THE
GIFT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
NOT
THAT
THE
LORD
IMPARTED
SECRET
INFORMATION
APOSTLES
INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH
EUSEBIUS
REFERS
TO
THE
GROUPS
WHICH
WE
TODAY
CALL
GNOSTICS
AS
PROMULGATORS
OF
A
FALSE
GNOSIS
EUSEBIUS
OP
CIT
III
HIS
GRIPE
WAS
NOT
THAT
THAY
PROFESSED
A
GNOSIS
BUT
THAT
THEY
HAD
THE
WRONG
ONE
IM
AFRAID
THAT
I
CANNOT
FIND
THIS
PORTRAYAL
IN
EH
I
DONT
SEE
ANYWHERE
IN
WHERE
EUSEBIUS
MENTIONS
THAT
CERTAIN
GNOSTICS
HAD
THE
WRONG
GNOSIS
THE
CLOSEST
IS
WHEN
EUSEBIUS
SUMMARIZES
HEGESIPPUS
STATEMENTS
WHILST
IF
THERE
WERE
ANY
AT
ALL
THAT
ATTEMPTED
TO
PERVERT
THE
SOUND
DOCTRINE
OF
THE
SAVING
GOSPEL
THEY
WERE
YET
SKULKING
IN
DARK
RETREATS
NOW
ONE
CAN
APPROACH
THIS
AND
OTHER
SUCH
EVIDENCE
IN
MANY
WAYS
I
DONT
INTEND
THAT
EVERYONE
INTERPRET
CHRISTIAN
HISTORY
AS
I
DO
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
EVIDENCE
EXISTS
FAVORABLY
INTERPRETED
OF
COURSE
OF
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
RITES
ANALOGOUS
TO
THOSE
PRACTICED
BY
MORMONS
TODAY
FAVORABLY
INTERPRETED
JUST
IN
LOOKING
AT
TWO
OF
THE
FOUR
REFERENCES
THAT
YOU
GAVE
I
HAVE
THE
EH
HANDY
IRENAEUS
AND
THE
CLEMETINE
RECOGNITIONS
I
WILL
HAVE
TO
LOOK
FOR
I
SEE
NO
ROOM
FOR
SUCH
INTERPRETATIONS
AND
ANY
SUCH
INTERPRETATION
STILL
FALLS
SHORT
OF
AN
EQUIVALENCE
TO
THE
TEMPLE
CEREMONIES
THE
LINKS
FOR
JAYS
USING
EH
FOR
SUPPORT
ARE
IMPARTING
THE
GIFT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
IMPARTED
SECRET
INFORMATION
BEING
GIVEN
SECRET
SIGNS
AND
TOKENS
TO
GAIN
ENTRANCE
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
THERE
IS
NOT
ENOUGH
EQUIVALENCE
BETWEEN
THE
THE
IDEAS
FOR
US
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
CALL
THIS
FAVORABLE
INTERPRETATION
IT
APPEARS
TO
BE
CLOSER
TO
FABRICATION
