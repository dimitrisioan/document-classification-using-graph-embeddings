RE
SATAN
KICKED
OUT
OF
HEAVEN
BIBLICAL
WRITES
HELLO
ALL
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
SATAN
I
WAS
TAUGHT
A
LONG
TIME
AGO
THAT
SATAN
WAS
REALLY
AN
ANGEL
OF
GOD
AND
WAS
KICKED
OUT
OF
HEAVEN
BECAUSE
HE
CHALLENGED
GODS
AUTHORITY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
I
CANNOT
FIND
THIS
IN
THE
BIBLE
IS
IT
IN
THE
BIBLE
IF
NOT
WHERE
DID
IT
ORIGINATE
WONDERING
EDDIE
THE
QUICK
ANSWER
REVELATION
AND
THERE
WAS
WAR
IN
HEAVEN
MICHAEL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
FOUGHT
AGAINST
THE
DRAGON
AND
HIS
ANGELS
WHO
FOUGHT
BACK
BUT
HE
THE
DRAGON
WAS
NOT
STRONG
ENOUGH
AND
THEY
LOST
THEIR
PLACE
IN
HEAVEN
THE
GREAT
DRAGON
WAS
HURLED
DOWNTHAT
ANCIENT
SERPENT
CALLED
THE
DEVIL
AND
SATAN
WHO
LEADS
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
ASTRAY
HE
WAS
HURLED
DOWN
TO
THE
EARTH
AND
HIS
ANGELS
WITH
HIM
THE
EARLIER
PART
OF
CHAPTER
DEALS
VERY
SYMBOLICALLY
WITH
WHY
SATAN
ROSE
UP
IN
BATTLE
AGAINST
MICHAEL
AND
THE
GOOD
ANGELS
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
HOPE
THIS
CLEARS
IT
UP
