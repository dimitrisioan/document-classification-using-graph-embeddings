RE
WHAT
WAS
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
NOTE
I
AM
CROSSPOSTING
ACTUALLY
EMAILING
THIS
TO

QUOTATIONS
OMITTED
THIS
IS
IN
RESPONSE
TO
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
I
EXPLAINED
IT
BUT
LEFT
JUSTIFICATION
UP
TO
OUR
CATHOLIC
READERS
CLH
THERE
IS
NO
DIRECT
REFERENCE
IN
THE
HOLY
SCRIPTURE
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
MENTION
OF
MARYS
BLESSEDNESSFULL
OF
GRACE
IN
THE
ANNUNCIATION
BY
ANGEL
GABRIEL
IN
LUKE
AND
IN
THE
MONTH
THE
ANGEL
GABRIEL
WAS
SENT
FROM
GOD
UNTO
A
CITY
OF
GALILEE
NAMED
NAZARETH
TO
A
VIRGIN
ESPOUSED
TO
A
MAN
WHOSE
NAME
WAS
JOSEPH
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
DAVID
AND
THE
VIRGINS
NAME
WAS
MARY
AND
THE
ANGEL
CAME
UNTO
HER
AND
SAID
HAIL
THOU
THAT
ART
HIGHLY
FAVOURED
THE
LORD
IS
WITH
THEE
BLESSED
ART
THOU
AMONG
WOMEN
NOW
NOW
HOLD
THAT
LINE
OF
THOUGHT
THE
LORD
IS
WITH
MARY
BLESSED
ART
THOU
AMONG
WOMEN
WHILE
YOU
READ
ON
IN
THE
BOOK
FIRST
LADY
OF
THE
WORLD
A
POPULAR
HISTORY
OF
DEVOTION
TO
MARY
BY
PETER
LAPPIN
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
MATTER
IS
REALLY
FAR
MORE
COMPLICATED
THAN
THE
ASSUMPTION
THIS
AROSE
IN
AD
IT
IS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
FEAST
OF
MARYS
CONCEPTION
UNDER
THE
TITLE
THE
CONCEPTION
OF
SAINT
ANNE
ORIGINALLY
COMMEMORATED
THE
PHYSICAL
MIRACLE
OF
A
WOMAN
BEYOND
THE
AGE
OF
CHILD
BEARING
CONCEIVING
A
DAUGHTER
JUST
AS
ELIZABETH
HAD
CONCEIVED
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
A
TRANSFER
IN
EMPHASIS
FROM
THE
PHYSICAL
MIRACLE
WROUGHT
IN
ANNE
TO
THE
MIRACLE
OF
GRACE
WROUGHT
BY
GOD
IN
THE
SOUL
OF
MARY
WAS
LOGICAL
MARY
IS
THE
INCORRUPTIBLE
TIMBER
OUT
OF
WHICH
WAS
HEWN
THE
TABERNACLE
OF
CHRISTS
SINLESS
BODY
SHE
IS
GODS
EDEN
IN
WHOM
THERE
IS
NO
TREE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
NO
SERPENT
THAT
HARMS
HER
PERFECT
BEAUTY
AND
SPOTLESSNESS
FIND
THEIR
EXEMPLAR
IN
CHRIST
HER
PURITY
IN
THAT
OF
THE
FATHER
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
COUNCIL
OF
EPHESUS
SHE
WAS
HAILED
AS
INNOCENT
WITHOUT
BLEMISH
IMMACULATE
INVIOLATE
SPOTLESS
HOLY
IN
SOUL
AND
BODY
WHO
WAS
BLESSED
AS
A
LILY
FROM
AMONG
THORNS
UNLEARNED
IN
THE
EVIL
WAYS
OF
EVE
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
THIRTEENTH
CENTURY
AN
IRISH
FRANCISCAN
JOHN
DUNS
SCOTUS
MAINTAINED
THAT
IT
WAS
A
GREATER
THING
FOR
HIM
TO
PRESERVE
HIS
THE
SON
MOTHER
FROM
ALL
SIN
THAN
TO
USE
HIS
POWER
TO
CLEASE
HER
FROM
IT
LATER
NOW
LETS
GO
TO
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
BAPTISM
AND
ORIGINAL
SIN
FROM
POCKET
CATHOLIC
CATHECHISM
BY
JOHN
A
HARDON
BAPTISM
CONCUPISCENCE
REMAINS
AFTER
BAPTISM
CONCUPISCENCE
OR
THE
TENDENCY
TO
SIN
REMAINS
IN
THE
BAPTIZED
BUT
SINCE
IT
IS
LEFT
TO
PROVIDE
TRIAL
IT
HAS
NO
POWER
TO
INJURE
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
CONSENT
AND
WHO
BY
THE
GRACE
OF
CHRIST
JESUS
MANFULLY
RESIST
CANON
ORIGINAL
GIFTS
OF
ADAM
AND
EVE
BEFORE
THEIR
FALL
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
FOREGOING
WE
SEE
THAT
OUR
FIRST
PARENTS
WERE
ORIGINALLY
GIFTED
THREE
TIMES
OVER
THEY
HAD
THE
NATURAL
GIFTS
OF
HUMAN
BEINGS
ESPECIALLY
THE
POWER
TO
THINK
AND
TO
CHOOSE
FREELY
THE
HAD
THE
PRETERNATURAL
GIFTS
OF
BODILY
IMMORTALITY
AND
OF
INTEGRITY
OR
THE
INTERNAL
POWER
TO
CONTROL
DESIRES
THEY
HAD
THE
SUPERNATURAL
GIFTS
OF
SANCTIFYING
GRACE
THE
VIRTUES
OF
FAITH
HOPE
AND
CHARITY
AND
THE
CORRESPONDING
TITLE
TO
ENTER
HEAVEN
BY
THEIR
DISOBEDIENCE
THEY
LOST
THE
SUPERNATURAL
AND
PRETERNATURAL
GIFTS
ENTIRELY
AND
WERE
WEAKENED
WITHOUT
LOSING
THEIR
NATURAL
CAPACITY
TO
REASON
AND
TO
CHOOSE
FREELY
BAPTISM
RESTORES
THE
SUPERNATURAL
LIFE
LOST
BY
ADAMS
SIN
IT
DOES
NOT
RESTORE
THE
PRETERNATURAL
GIFTS
BUT
GIFTS
AS
A
TITLE
TO
A
GLORIFIED
RESTORATION
OF
OUR
BODIES
ON
THE
LAST
DAY
GOING
BACK
TO
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
INTERPRETATION
IS
IN
ANY
OTHER
BOOKS
BUT
IT
MAY
BE
ANOTHER
CONTRIBUTION
TO
THE
PUZZLE
GIVEN
THE
MIRACLE
OF
ST
ANNE
BEARING
A
CHILD
AT
A
NONCHILDBEARING
AGE
AND
CHRIST
WAS
NOT
YET
BORN
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
BAPTISM
YET
ON
MARYS
BIRTH
BUT
STILL
THE
ANGEL
GABRIELS
GREETINGS
WAS
HAIL
MARY
FULL
OF
GRACE
THE
LORD
IS
WITH
YOU
BLESSED
ART
THOU
AMONGST
WOMEN
EVEN
MARY
WAS
CONFUSED
ABOUT
THIS
GREETING
MARY
COULD
VERY
WELL
HAVE
POSSESSED
ALL
OF
THE
TREEFOLD
ORIGINAL
GIFTS
ABOVE
GIVEN
TO
OUR
FIRST
PARENTS
ADAM
AND
EVE
BEFORE
THEIR
SIN
HAIL
MARY
EXAMPLE
OF
PRAISE
GIVEN
BY
THE
ANGEL
GABRIEL
FULL
OF
GRACE
NATURAL
PRETERNATURAL
SUPERNATURAL
THE
LORD
IS
WITH
YOU
AT
THOSE
TIMES
GOD
WOULD
DEFINITELY
WANT
TO
BE
WITH
THOSE
HE
HAS
MADE
BLESSED
BLESSED
ART
THOU
AMONGST
WOMEN
THAT
SAYS
IT
ALL
AT
THE
CONCEPTION
GOD
MADE
MARY
FULL
OF
GRACE
AND
BLESSED
AS
THE
TABERNACLE
FOR
THE
COMING
BODY
OF
CHRIST
AND
SO
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
OF
MARY
IS
TRUE
AND
MARY
STILL
HAS
MAINTAINED
HER
IMMACULATE
HEART
MARIDA
PS
I
DO
HOPE
THAT
OTHERS
WILL
CONTINUE
MORE
LIGHT
AND
FACTS
ON
THIS
MATTER
THANKS
