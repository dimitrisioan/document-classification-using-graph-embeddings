drugs
are

those
who
have

in

hole
in
their
hearts
must
do
something
to
ease
the
pain
i
have
heard
this
claim
quite
a
few
times
does
anybody
here
know
who
first
came
up
with
the
godshaped
hole
business
this
is
why
the
most
effective
substanceabuse
recovery
programs
involve
meeting
peoples
spiritual
needs
you
might
want
to
provide
some
evidence
next
time
you
make
a
claim
like
this
in
programs
like
alcoholics
anonymous
one
of
the
steps
involves
acknowleding
a
higher
power
aa
and
other
abuse
recovery
programs
are
acknowledged
as
being
among
the
most
effective
unfortunately
as
evidence
for
god
this
can
be
dismissed
by
stating
that
the
same
defect
of
personality
makes
substance
abusers
as
makes
people
religious
and
the
debunker
could
perhaps
acknowledge
that
being
religious
is
a
better
crutch
than
being
a
drug
addict
but
still
maintain
that
both
are
escapism
and
i
suspect
that
there
are
some
atheists
who
would
find
the
substance
abuse
preferable
to
christianity
i
think
that
an
essential
problem
with
communication
between
christ
ians
and
atheists
is
that
as
christians
we
necessarily
see
ourselves
as
incomplete
and
needing
god
the
godshaped
hole
while
atheists
necessarily
see
themselves
as
selfsufficient
if
the
atheists
are
right
christians
are
guilty
of
being
morally
weak
and
too
cowardly
to
stand
up
for
themselves
if
the
christians
are
right
the
atheists
are
guilty
of
considerable
arrogance
i
use
the
term
atheist
to
refer
to
a
person
who
has
a
definite
conviction
that
there
is
no
god
as
opposed
to
one
who
does
not
know
andor
does
not
care
