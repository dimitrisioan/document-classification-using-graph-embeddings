AYOUB
WRITES
AS
A
FINAL
NOTE
THE
ORIENTAL
ORTHODOX
AND
EASTREN
ORTHODOX
DID
SIGN
A
COMMON
STATEMENT
OF
CHRISTOLOGY
IN
WHICH
THE
HERESEY
OF
MONOPHYSITISM
WAS
CONDEMNED
SO
THE
COPTIC
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
DOES
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
MONOPHYSITISM
SORRY
WHAT
DOES
THE
COPTIC
CHURCH
BELIEVE
ABOUT
THE
WILL
AND
ENERGY
OF
CHRIST
WERE
THERE
ONE
OR
WERE
THERE
TWO
IE
HUMAN
AND
DIVINE
WILLS
AND
ENERGIES
IN
HIM
ALSO
WHAT
IS
THE
OBJECTION
OT
THE
COPTS
WITH
THE
POPE
OF
ROME
IE
WHY
IS
THERE
A
COPTIC
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
DO
YOU
REJECT
THE
SUPREME
JURISDICTION
OF
THE
SUCESSOR
OF
ST
PETER
WHO
BLESSED
ST
JOHN
MARK
BISHOP
OF
ALEXANDRIA
WAS
TRANSLATOR
FOR
AND
HIS
PREDECESSORS
OR
HIS
INFALLIBILITY
OR
WHAT
OTHER
THINGS
PERHAPS
FOR
YOUR
FIRST
SET
OF
QUESTIONS
REGARDING
THE
ENERGY
AND
WILL
OF
CHRIST
I
QUOTE
TO
YOU
THE
RELEVANT
PART
OF
THE
STATEMENT
SIGNED
BY
BOTH
EASTERN
CHALCEDONIAN
AND
ORIENTAL
NONCHALCEDONIAN
ORTHODOX
SCHOLARS
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
BOTH
FAMILIES
BOTH
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
BOTH
FAMILIES
AGREED
IN
CONDEMNING
THE
EUTYCHIAN
HERESY
BOTH
FAMILIES
CONFESS
THAT
THE
LOGOS
THE
SECOND
PERSON
OF
THE
HOLY
TRINITY
ONLY
BEGOTTEN
OF
THE
FATHER
BEFORE
THE
AGES
AND
CONSUBSTANTIAL
WITH
HIM
WAS
INCARNATE
AND
WAS
BORN
FROM
THE
VIRGIN
MARY
THEOTOKOS
FULLY
CONSUBSTANTIAL
WITH
US
PERFECT
MAN
WITH
SOUL
BODY
AND
MIND
NU
O
UPSILON
ZETA
HE
WAS
CRUCIFIED
DIED
WAS
BURIED
AND
ROSE
FROM
THE
DEAD
ON
THE
THIRD
DAY
ASCENDED
TO
THE
HEAVENLY
FATHER
WHERE
HE
SITS
ON
THE
RIGHT
HAND
OF
THE
FATHER
AS
LORD
OF
ALL
CREATION
AT
PENTECOST
BY
THE
COMING
OF
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
HE
MANIFESTED
THE
CHURCH
AS
HIS
BODY
WE
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
HIS
COMING
AGAIN
IN
THE
FULLNESS
OF
HIS
GLORY
ACCORDING
TO
THE
SCRIPTURES
BOTH
FAMILIES
CONDEMN
THE
NESTORIAN
HERESY
AND
THE
CRYPTONESTORIANISM
OF
THEODORET
OF
CYRUS
THEY
AGREE
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
MERELY
TO
SAY
THAT
CHRIST
IS
CONSUBSTANTIAL
BOTH
WITH
HIS
FATHER
AND
WITH
US
BY
NATURE
GOD
AND
BY
NATURE
MAN
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
AFFIRM
ALSO
THAT
THE
LOGOS
WHO
IS
BY
NATURE
GOD
BECAME
BY
NATURE
MAN
BY
HIS
INCARNATION
IN
THE
FULLNESS
OF
TIME
BOTH
FAMILIES
AGREE
THAT
THE
HYPOSTASIS
OF
THE
LOGOS
BECAME
COMPOSITE
BY
UNITING
TO
HIS
DIVINE
UNCREATED
NATURE
WITH
ITS
NATURAL
WILL
AND
ENERGY
WHICH
HE
HAS
IN
COMMON
WITH
THE
FATHER
AND
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
CREATED
HUMAN
NATURE
WHICH
HE
ASSUMED
AT
THE
INCARNATION
AND
MADE
HIS
OWN
WITH
ITS
NATURAL
WILL
AND
ENERGY
BOTH
FAMILIES
AGREE
THAT
THE
NATURES
WITH
THEIR
PROPER
ENERGIES
AND
WILLS
ARE
UNITED
HYPOSTATICALLY
AND
NATURALLY
WITHOUT
CONFUSION
WITHOUT
CHANGE
WITHOUT
DIVISION
AND
WITHOUT
SEPARATION
AND
THAT
THEY
ARE
DISTINGUISHED
IN
THOUGHT
ALONE
BOTH
FAMILIES
AGREE
THAT
HE
WHO
WILLS
AND
ACTS
IS
ALWAYS
THE
ONE
HYPOSTASIS
OF
THE
LOGOS
INCARNATE
I
GUESS
THAT
ADRESSES
YOUR
QUESTION
ADEQUATELY
AS
FOR
YOUR
SECOND
SET
OF
QUESTIONS
I
AM
AFRAID
THEY
ARE
IRRELEVANT
TO
THE
DISCUSSION
AT
LEAST
FROM
MY
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
MONOPHYSITISM
I
DO
NOT
SEE
HOW
THEY
RELATE
TO
THE
TOPIC
WE
ARE
DISCUSSING
OTHER
THAN
TO
START
AN
ENDLESS
ORTHODOXRC
DEBATE
WHICH
I
DO
NOT
PLAN
TO
ENGAGE
INTO
AS
A
BRIEF
ANSWER
TO
YOUR
QUESTIONS
THE
POSITION
OF
THE
COPTIC
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
REGARDING
THE
ROMAN
PONTIFF
HIS
JURISDICTION
HIS
INFALABILITY
ETC
IS
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
AS
ALL
THE
OTHER
ORTHODOX
CHURCHES
