DESIREE
BRADLEY
WRITES
I
MUST
HAVE
MISSED
THE
POSTINGS
ABOUT
WACO
DAVID
KORESH
AND
THE
SECOND
COMING
HOW
DOES
ONE
TELL
IF
A
SECOND
COMING
IS
THE
REAL
THING
UNLESS
THE
PERSON
CLAIMING
TO
BE
IT
IS
OBVIOUSLY
INSANE
ONE
RULE
OF
THUMB
IS
THAT
IF
A
PERSON
IS
MAKING
THE
CLAIM
THEY
ARE
WRONG
I
WAS
JUST
READING
JOHN
THIS
MORNING
I
THINK
THAT
IS
THE
RIGHT
CHAPTER
ANYWAY
IT
IS
CLOSE
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
A
BIBLE
AT
WORK
TO
CHECK
WITH
AND
IN
IT
JESUS
IS
TALKING
TO
HIS
DISCIPLES
ABOUT
HIS
IMPENDING
DEATH
AND
HE
SAYS
THAT
HE
WILL
BE
GOING
AWAY
AND
THEN
LATER
HE
WILL
BE
WITH
THEM
HE
SAID
SOMETHING
ALONG
THE
LINES
OF
I
WILL
BE
IN
YOU
AND
YOU
WILL
BE
IN
ME
AGAIN
I
CANNOT
PROVIDE
THE
EXACT
QUOTE
OR
CITATION
ANYWAY
MY
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THIS
IS
THAT
THE
SECOND
COMING
WILL
NOT
BE
AN
OUTWARD
EVENT
IT
IS
AN
INWARD
EVENT
CHRIST
WILL
COME
TO
LIVE
IN
OUR
HEARTS
AND
WE
WILL
LIVE
IN
HIM
IF
YOU
LOOK
FOR
A
PERSON
YOU
WILL
BE
DECEIVED
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
JEWS
HAD
BEEN
LOOKING
FOR
A
MESSIAH
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
POLITICAL
OR
MILITARY
LEADER
AND
SO
DIDNT
RECOGNIZE
JESUS
WHEN
HE
CAME
JESUS
TRIED
TO
SHOW
THAT
HIS
KINGDOM
WAS
NOT
OF
THIS
EARTH
A
LOT
OF
WHAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
WRITTEN
ABOUT
THE
SECOND
COMING
SEEMS
TO
BASED
ON
AN
EXPECTATION
OF
CHRIST
COMING
BACK
AND
FINALLY
TAKING
OVER
THE
WORLD
AND
RUNNING
IT
THE
WAY
IT
SHOULD
BE
IT
SOUNDS
A
LOT
LIKE
WHAT
THE
JEWS
WERE
LOOKING
FOR
THE
FIRST
COMING
WASNT
LIKE
THAT
AND
I
SEE
NO
REASON
FOR
THE
SECOND
COMING
TO
BE
LIKE
THAT
EITHER
OH
AND
BY
THE
WAY
I
DONT
EXPECT
IT
TO
HAPPEN
ONCE
THERE
IS
NO
ONE
SECOND
COMING
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
LITTLE
ONES
EVERY
TIME
CHRIST
COMES
INTO
SOMEONES
HEART
CHRIST
HAS
COME
AGAIN
