RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ARTICLE
YOU
WROTE
THE
GENIUS
OF
SCIENCE
IS
THAT
IT
DISCOVERED
THAT
ENORMOUS
PROGRESS
IN
KNOWLEDGE
COULD
BE
MADE
BY
ISOLATING
THE
STUDY
OF
PHYSICAL
INTERACTIONS
FOR
THE
MORE
GENERAL
AREAS
OF
STUDY
AND
PROCEEDING
NOT
BY
LOGICAL
ARGUMENT
BUT
BY
EXPERIMENT
THE
SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
IS
HYPOTHESIZE
ATTEMPT
TO
DISPROVE
THE
HYPOTHESIS
IF
YOU
FAIL
PUBLISH
IF
OTHERS
FAIL
TO
DISPROVE
YOUR
HYPOTHESIS
ACCEPT
IT
AS
A
WORKING
THEORY
AND
MOVE
ON
THIS
METHOD
IS
SUITABLE
ONLY
FOR
THE
STUDY
OF
OBJECTS
WITHOUT
WILL
OBJECTS
WHICH
DO
NOT
TAKE
AN
INTEREST
IN
THE
EXPERIMENT
SCIENCE
DOES
NOT
PROGRESS
VIA
EXPERIMENTATION
BUT
BY
PHILOSOPHISING
ONE
AIM
OF
EXPERIMENTS
IS
TO
INVESTIGATE
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THE
HYPTHESES
RESULTING
FROM
THE
MODELS
PRODUCED
BY
THIS
THINKING
PROCESS
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
SCIENCE
IS
THE
ASSUMPTION
MANY
ADVOCATES
OF
SCIENCE
MAKE
THAT
THE
SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
IS
THE
ONLY
METHOD
OF
SERIOUS
STUDY
THE
ONLY
ONE
LEADING
TO
KNOWLEDGE
RATHER
THAN
BELIEF
SCIENCE
HAS
ONE
ADVANTAGE
OF
ALL
OTHER
APPROACHES
TO
EXPLAINING
THE
WORLD
IT
IS
OBJECTIVE
ITS
FURTHER
ARROGANCE
IS
THE
ASSUMPTION
WHICH
ARISES
THAT
SINCE
SCIENCE
IS
THE
ONLY
VALID
METHOD
OF
THOUGHT
EVERYTHING
WHICH
EXISTS
MUST
BE
THE
SORT
OF
THING
WHICH
THE
SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
CAN
STUDY
AND
THAT
IF
THE
SCIENTIFIC
METHOD
CANNOT
STUDY
IT
IT
EITHER
DOES
NOT
EXIST
OR
CANNOT
IN
ANY
WAY
BE
KNOWN
ANYTHING
WHICH
AFFECTS
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
CAN
BE
STUDIED
FOR
EXAMPLE
SINCE
WE
ARE
PART
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
ANYTHING
INCLUDING
SPIRITS
WHICH
AFFECTS
OUR
BEHAVIOUR
CAN
BE
OBSERVED
SCIENCE
DOES
NOT
MAKE
ANY
CLAIMS
ABOUT
THE
EXISTENCE
OR
NONEXISTENCE
OF
OBJECTS
WHICH
DO
NOT
AFFECT
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
SINCE
THESE
ASUMPTIONS
ABOUT
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
WORLD
CANNOT
THEMSELVES
BE
MADE
THE
SUBJECT
OF
EXPERIMENT
IT
IS
BAD
SCIENCE
TO
BELIEVE
THEM
AS
WELL
AS
ARROGANCE
ILLOGIC
AND
JUST
PLAIN
SLOPPY
THINKING
THE
PURPOSE
OF
SCIENCE
IS
TO
PRODUCE
A
MODEL
OF
THE
PHYSICAL
WORLD
THE
MODEL
MUST
BE
ABLE
TO
EXPLAIN
ALL
PAST
OBSERVATIONS
AND
PREDICT
THE
OUTCOME
OF
FUTURE
OBSERVATIONS
ONE
OF
THE
AIMS
OF
EXPERIMENTS
IS
TO
CARRY
OUT
WELL
DEFINED
OBSERVATIONS
WHICH
ARE
OBJECTIVE
IDEALLY
SCIENTIST
WILL
EXCEPT
THE
MODEL
WHICH
BEST
DESCRIBES
THE
WORLD
AND
THE
MODEL
WHICH
REALISES
ON
THE
MINIMAL
NUMBER
OF
ASSUMPTIONS
AT
THE
MOMENT
MODELS
WHICH
DO
NOT
RELY
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
SOME
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
EXISTING
ARE
EQUALLY
POWERFUL
TO
ONES
WHICH
ASSUME
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
A
SPIRITUAL
WORLD
AS
THE
NONSPIRITUAL
MODELS
HAS
FEWER
ASSUMPTIONS
IT
SHOULD
BE
THE
CURRENTLY
ACCEPTED
MODELS
THE
SCIENTIFIC
PROCESS
NEVER
ASSUMES
THAT
ITS
PRESENT
MODELS
ARE
THE
CORRECT
ONES
WHEREAS
MANY
RELIGIONS
CLAIM
TO
REPRESENT
THE
TRUTH
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
MANY
THEISTS
IS
THAT
THEY
CLAIM
TO
REPRESENT
THE
TRUTH
THIS
CANNOT
BE
SAID
OF
SCIENTISTS
