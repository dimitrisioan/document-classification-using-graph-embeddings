RE
ARSENOKOITAI
NT
MEANING
OF
CONVICTION
OF
SIN
A
METAEXEGETICAL
OR
METHODOLOGICAL
ESSAY
IN
ARTICLE
REXLEXFNALFNALGOV
WRITES
I
CANT
POST
IT
ALL
AT
ONCE
SO
IT
WILL
COME
PIECE
MEAL
AND
NOT
DAILY
I
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
READING
IT
WHEN
I
GOT
TO
THE
LIBRARY
LAST
WEEK
IT
WAS
WITH
THE
OBJECT
IN
VIEW
TO
LOOK
AT
SOME
ARTICLES
THAT
HAVE
APPEARED
OVER
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
SINCE
MY
PREVIOUS
LOOK
AT
THE
LITERATURE
UN
FORTUNATELY
THEY
HAD
MOVED
THE
JOURNAL
BACKISSUES
SO
I
DIDNT
GET
A
LOOK
AT
THE
ARTICLES
I
WAS
HOPING
TO
FIND
I
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
RESERVE
MY
OWN
JUDGMENT
ON
ARSENOKOITAI
UNTIL
I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
LATEST
SCHOLARLY
WORK
AND
I
CAN
HOPE
THAT
REXLEXS
POSTING
MAY
GIVE
SOME
MEAT
TO
CHEW
ON
HOWEVER
WHAT
I
CAN
DO
NOW
IS
TO
POINT
OUT
THE
METHODOLOGICAL
ISSUES
WHAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
SHOWN
FOR
ANYTHING
TO
BE
CONCLUDED
IN
THIS
MATTER
IF
THE
ARTICLE
REXLEX
POSTS
ADDRESSES
THESE
ISSUES
SO
MUCH
THE
BETTER
IF
NOT
YOU
WILL
PERHAPS
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
HARD
JAMES
B
DEYOUNG
WRITES
IN
ABSTRACTU
THIS
STUDY
ARGUES
THAT
PAUL
COINED
THE
TERM
ARSENOKOITAI
DERIVING
IT
FROM
THE
LXX
OF
LEV
CF
AND
USING
IT
FOR
HOMOSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
AND
BEHAVIOR
IT
IS
ONLY
A
MINOR
POINT
BUT
LET
ME
MAKE
IT
ANYWAY
DE
YOUNG
HAS
ALREADY
CONTRADICTED
HIS
OWN
PRIOR
ASSERTION
IN
THIS
ABSTRACT
THAT
THE
ANCIENT
ANALYSIS
OF
THESE
ISSUES
WAS
CONCERNED
WITH
ACTIONS
AND
NOT
WITH
ORIENTATION
I
DOUBT
THIS
WILL
HAVE
MUCH
BEARING
ON
THE
ARTICLE
AS
SUCH
BUT
THOUGHT
I
SHOULD
POINT
IT
OUT
FROM
THE
START
THE
HYPOTHESIS
DE
YOUNG
IS
ADVANCING
IS
THAT
PAUL
A
COINED
THE
WORD
AND
B
HIS
INTENDED
MEANING
FOR
IT
WAS
IN
REFERENCE
TO
THE
LEVITICAL
LAW
THE
QUESTIONS
I
WISH
TO
RAISE
ARE
HOW
WOULD
ONE
GO
ABOUT
CONFIRMING
THE
TRUTH
OF
THIS
HYPOTHESIS
AND
WHAT
FOLLOWS
IF
ONE
ACCEPTS
OR
STIPULATES
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
THE
DISCUSSION
THAT
IT
IS
CORRECT
NOTE
THAT
B
IS
INDEPENDENT
OF
A
I
CONSIDER
B
FAR
MORE
PLAUSIBLE
THAN
A
WHICH
SEEMS
MERELY
TO
BE
A
COUNSEL
OF
DESPAIR
OVER
FINDING
NOTHING
IN
THE
LITERATURE
CONTEMPORARY
WITH
PAUL
TO
CLARIFY
THIS
WORD
SO
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
PAUL
DOES
NOT
IN
GENERAL
INVENT
WORDS
ANYWHERE
ELSE
IN
HIS
LETTERS
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
AN
OTHERWISEESTABLISHED
PATTERN
OF
COINAGES
IT
IS
NOT
SOUND
METHODOLOGY
TO
ASSUME
IT
PARTICULARLY
IF
HE
GIVES
NO
HINT
IN
THE
IMMEDI
ATE
TEXT
TO
FIX
THE
COINAGES
MEANING
FOR
HIS
AUDIENCE
AS
YET
THE
EXTRACT
PRESENTS
NO
EVIDENCE
AT
ALL
WHAT
DO
WE
NEED
TO
CONFIRM
OR
REJECT
THE
HYPOTHESIS
WHICH
I
SHOULD
SAY
AT
THE
OUTSET
I
FIND
SOMEWHAT
PLAUSIBLE
I
CERTAINLY
KNOW
OF
NOTHING
WHICH
MAKES
IT
AN
IMPOSSIBLE
WAY
OF
CONSTRUING
THIS
PROBLEM
PASSAGE
IM
GOING
TO
SET
ASIDE
FOR
THE
MOMENT
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
PAUL
MIGHT
HAVE
COINED
THIS
USAGE
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
MORE
TRACTABLE
QUESTION
OF
WHAT
IT
MEANS
FOR
THIS
THERE
ARE
IN
PRINCIPLE
TWO
KINDS
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
CAN
BE
ADDUCED
INTERNAL
AND
EXTERNAL
THAT
IS
WE
CAN
LOOK
AT
THE
TEXT
OF
PAULS
LETTER
FOR
CLARIFICATION
OR
LOOK
OUTSIDE
THAT
TO
PRIOR
OR
CONTEMPORARY
WRITINGS
THAT
PAUL
MIGHT
HAVE
RELIED
ON
OR
TO
DERIVATIVE
WRITINGS
THAT
HAVE
SOME
CLAIM
OF
ACCESS
TO
PAULS
MEANING
THE
SINGLE
WORST
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
WORD
IN
CORINTHIANS
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
INTERNAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
PAULS
MEANING
HE
USES
THE
WORD
TOTALLY
WITHOUT
AN
EXPLANATION
OR
HINT
AS
TO
HIS
MEANING
SAVE
THAT
ITS
INCLUSION
IN
A
LIST
OF
NEGATIVES
IMPLIES
THAT
IT
HAS
FOR
HIM
SOME
NEGATIVE
MEANING
WE
ARE
LEFT
AS
THE
ONLY
INTERNAL
CLUE
WITH
THE
ETYMOLOGY
OR
FORMATION
OF
THE
WORD
WHICH
IS
INDEED
THE
REASON
THAT
DE
YOUNG
AND
OTHERS
BEFORE
HIM
HAVE
ASSOCIATED
IT
WITH
THE
LEVITICUS
PROHIBITION
OF
MEN
VERBING
WITH
OTHER
MEN
WHERE
VERB
IS
SOME
STANDARD
EUPHEMISM
FOR
HAVING
SEX
LIE
IN
LEVITICUS
BED
IN
GREEK
ONE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
BEDDERS
KOITAI
IS
NOT
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
USED
THAT
WAY
IN
GREEK
THEREFORE
I
OFFER
ONE
SERIOUS
TEST
WHICH
DE
YOUNGS
HYPOTHESIS
MUST
PASS
OR
BE
REJECTED
O
FIND
A
BODY
OF
GREEK
TEXTS
CONTEMPORARY
WITH
PAUL
OR
NOT
MUCH
PRIOR
TO
HIS
DAY
SUCH
THAT
THE
XKOITAI
FORMATION
IMPLIES
MEN
WHO
HAVE
SEX
WITH
X
OBVIOUSLY
THE
BEST
CASE
IS
TO
FIND
SUCH
USAGES
OF
ARSENOKOITAI
ITSELF
SUCH
TEXTS
WOULD
BE
CONFIRMATION
THAT
THE
WORD
CAN
BE
READ
THAT
WAY
IT
IS
WORTH
EMPHASIZING
THAT
COMPOUND
WORDS
ARE
NOT
IN
GENERAL
UNDER
STANDABLE
BY
PROJECTING
WHAT
THE
READER
MAY
IMAGINE
BY
THE
JUXTAPOSITION
OF
THE
ROOTS
EXISTENCE
OF
SUCH
PARALLELS
DOESNT
PROVE
THE
HYPOTHESIS
CORRECT
BUT
IT
GOES
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARDS
MAKING
SUCH
A
USAGE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
ORIGINAL
WITH
PAUL
IN
THE
SPECIFIC
CASE
OF
X
ARSEN
POSSIBLE
OF
COMPREHENSION
BY
HIS
READERS
MY
TEST
MOVES
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
EXTERNAL
EVIDENCE
IF
PAUL
DOES
NOT
IN
HIS
TEXT
EXPLAIN
HIS
WORD
AND
HE
DOES
NOT
THEN
HE
HAS
TO
EXPECT
HIS
READERS
TO
ALREADY
KNOW
THE
WORD
WHICH
STANDS
AGAINST
ITS
BEING
A
COINAGE
OR
TO
EXPECT
THAT
IT
MIMICS
WORD
FORMATIONS
THAT
THEY
DO
KNOW
SUCH
THAT
THEY
CAN
GUESS
HIS
MEANING
WITHOUT
TOO
MUCH
FLOUNDERING
EXTERNAL
EVIDENCE
THAT
IS
TEXTS
OTHER
THAN
PAULS
OWN
AND
LEXICOGRAPHIC
OR
SOCIALHISTORICAL
CONSIDERATIONS
THAT
MIGHT
BE
ADDUCED
THEN
COME
INTO
THE
PICTURE
IF
THERE
ARE
OTHER
USES
OF
THE
WORD
NOT
DEPENDENT
ON
PAUL
WHICH
HAVE
SUFFICIENT
INTERNAL
CONTEXTUAL
EVIDENCE
OR
SOME
GLOSS
BY
A
CONTEMPORARY
SCRIBE
TO
SHOW
A
DEROGATORY
REFERENCE
TO
MALE
HOMOSEXU
ALITY
OR
SIMILAR
KOITAI
FORMATIONS
USED
IN
SIMILAR
WAYS
THEN
ONE
HAS
GROUNDS
FOR
O
DENYING
THAT
PAUL
COINED
THE
WORD
AND
O
ASSUMING
THAT
HIS
READERS
MIGHT
UNDERSTAND
HIS
MEANING
DO
YOU
SEE
THE
PROBLEM
IF
PAUL
COINED
THE
WORD
THEN
HE
REQUIRES
HIS
READERS
TO
SHARE
ENOUGH
CONTEXT
WITH
HIM
TO
COMPREHEND
HIS
COINAGE
AND
ITS
INTENT
IN
THIS
CASE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
STIPULATING
DE
YOUNGS
GUESS
UNDERSTAND
HIM
TO
BE
REFERRING
TO
THE
LEVITICAL
UNIVERSAL
PROHIBITION
OF
MALEMALE
SEX
THIS
MIND
YOU
IN
A
CONTEXT
WHERE
PAUL
HAS
EMPHASIZED
AT
LEAST
TO
OTHER
CONGREGATIONS
AND
SO
ONE
ASSUMES
TO
THE
CORINTHIANS
HOW
ELSE
TO
EXPLAIN
COR
AND
THE
CORINTHIANS
HAVING
TO
BE
PULLED
BACK
FROM
OVERINTERPRETING
THEIR
FREEDOM
THE
NON
APPLICABILITY
OF
TORAH
LAW
TO
HIS
GENTILE
CONVERTS
AMONG
THE
CONSIDERATIONS
THAT
MAKE
IT
IMPLAUSIBLE
FOR
PAUL
TO
HAVE
COINED
THE
WORD
ITS
FIRST
ELEMENT
IS
ARCHAIC
ARSEN
IS
AN
OLD
ATTIC
OR
IONIC
FORM
OF
WHAT
IN
EVEN
CLASSICAL
LET
ALONE
KOINE
TIMES
WOULD
BE
ASSIMILATED
AS
ARREN
TO
ME
THIS
IMPLIES
THAT
WE
ARE
EVEN
MORE
THAN
USUALLY
NEEDFUL
OF
EXTERNAL
EVIDENCE
TO
PIN
DOWN
MEANING
AND
USAGE
WHAT
IS
PAUL
DOING
INVENTING
A
WORD
IN
OBSOLETE
ATTIC
FORMATION
AND
IF
HE
DIDNT
COIN
THE
WORD
BUT
PICKED
IT
UP
LIKE
THE
OTHERS
IN
HIS
LIST
AS
COMMON
TERMS
OF
DEROGATION
THEN
HIS
MEANING
WILL
BE
FOR
HIS
READERS
CONSTRAINED
BY
THAT
COMMON
MEANING
SINCE
HE
GIVES
NO
OTHER
I
CANNOT
EMPHASIZE
ENOUGH
THAT
PAUL
DOES
NOT
TELL
US
WHAT
HE
MEANS
BY
THIS
WORD
WE
AND
HIS
ORIGINAL
READERS
ARE
GUESSING
THEY
AT
LEAST
HAD
A
CONTEMPORARY
CONTEXT
AND
MAYBE
PAUL
HAD
USED
THIS
VERY
WORD
AND
EXPLAINED
IT
IN
GREAT
DETAIL
TO
THEM
IN
PERSON
BUT
WE
HAVE
NO
TRACE
OF
EVIDENCE
OF
THAT
AND
TO
SUPPOSE
IT
IS
MERE
FANTASY
SO
WE
ARE
DESPERATELY
IN
NEED
OF
EXTERNAL
EVIDENCE
ABOUT
THIS
WORD
AND
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
EXCEPTIONALLY
MEAGRE
THAT
IS
PRECISELY
THE
PROBLEM
I
CAN
THINK
OF
SEVERAL
MORE
OR
LESS
EQUALLY
PLAUSIBLE
HYPOTHESES
ABOUT
THE
WORD
A
IT
WAS
A
STANDARD
GUTTER
TERM
OF
ABUSE
FOR
SOME
OR
ALL
MAYBE
VERY
SPECIFIC
MAYBE
VERY
GENERAL
HOMOSEXUAL
MALE
ACTIVITIES
B
IT
WAS
A
TERM
OF
ABUSE
USED
BY
JEWS
ABOUT
THE
AWFUL
HOMOSEXUAL
GREEKS
WHICH
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
CONSCIOUSLY
ASSOCIATED
ON
THEIR
PART
WITH
THE
LEVITICUS
PASSAGE
C
PAUL
INVENTED
THE
TERM
AND
AGAIN
THERE
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
AN
ASSOCIATION
WITH
LEVITICUS
IN
HIS
DOING
SO
HE
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
INTEND
THE
WORD
TO
HAVE
AN
EXPLICIT
AND
UNIVERSAL
APPLICATION
WITH
ABSOLUTE
AND
CLEAR
BOUNDARIES
SINCE
NONE
OF
HIS
OTHER
WORDS
IN
THAT
LIST
HAVE
SUCH
CHARACTER
THIS
LAST
SEEMS
TO
ME
ABOUT
THE
LEAST
PLAUSIBLE
OF
THE
HYPOTHESES
IM
ADVANCING
OF
THESE
ID
SAY
OFF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
THAT
A
IS
MOST
PLAUSIBLE
BUT
I
STILL
HAVE
RESERVATIONS
ABOUT
THAT
TOO
IF
THE
WORD
NEVER
APPEARS
BEFORE
PAUL
AND
IN
LATER
USES
HAS
SOME
EVIDENCE
OF
DEPENDING
ON
PAUL
THEN
ONE
CAN
OPT
FOR
PAULS
COINING
IT
IF
IT
DOES
APPEAR
BEFORE
HIM
HE
MIGHT
STILL
HAVE
COINED
IT
BEING
UNAWARE
OF
PRIOR
USE
IN
WHICH
CASE
HIS
COINAGE
IS
INHERENTLY
CONFUSING
BUT
ONE
SHOULD
NORMALLY
DEMOTE
C
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
ANY
EARLIER
USES
ESPECIALLY
IF
THEY
CAN
BE
SHOWN
TO
HAVE
BEEN
AT
ALL
COMMON
IN
THE
PLACES
PAUL
TRAVELED
IN
EITHER
OF
THE
A
OR
B
CASES
ONE
HAS
TO
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
PAULS
RELATION
TO
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
USAGE
HE
PICKED
THE
WORD
UP
FROM
AND
WHETHER
IT
BE
FROM
THE
GREEK
OR
JEWISH
COMMUNITIES
PAULS
RELATIONS
ARE
HARDLY
STRAIGHT
FORWARD
THERE
IS
SO
FAR
AS
I
HAVE
YET
SEEN
LITTLE
OR
NO
EXTERNAL
EVIDENCE
TO
AID
US
IN
SELECTING
ONE
OF
THESE
OR
SOME
OTHER
HYPOTHESIS
YOUR
GUESS
IS
AS
GOOD
AS
MINE
OR
MAYBE
WORSE
OR
MAYBE
BETTER
DEPENDING
ON
A
LOT
OF
THINGS
BUT
IT
REMAINS
SO
FAR
GUESSWORK
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
YOU
BUT
I
FOR
ONE
WILL
NOT
EQUATE
HUMAN
GUESSWORK
WITH
THE
WILL
OF
GOD
BY
ALL
MEANS
BE
CONVINCED
IN
YOUR
OWN
CONSCIENCE
ABOUT
WHAT
PAUL
IS
GETTING
AT
AS
HE
SAYS
ELSEWHERE
ON
WHAT
WAS
IN
HIS
DAY
A
MAJOR
CONTROVERSY
OF
SOMEWHAT
THIS
SAME
CHARACTER
ROMANS
HOLD
ON
TO
YOUR
OWN
BELIEF
AS
BETWEEN
YOURSELF
AND
GOD
AND
CONSIDER
THE
MAN
FORTUNATE
WHO
CAN
MAKE
HIS
DECISION
WITHOUT
GOING
AGAINST
HIS
CONSCIENCE
BUT
ANYBODY
WHO
EATS
IN
A
STATE
OF
DOUBT
IS
CONDEMNED
BECAUSE
HE
IS
NOT
IN
GOOD
FAITH
AND
EVERY
ACT
DONE
IN
BAD
FAITH
IS
A
SIN
FOR
MY
PART
I
CANNOT
SEE
ANY
WAY
TO
RESOLVE
PAULS
MEANING
IN
THE
USE
OF
ARSENOKOITAI
WITHOUT
DIRECTLY
APPLICABLE
EXTERNAL
EVIDENCE
AND
BY
THE
NATURE
OF
SUCH
EXTERNAL
EVIDENCE
IT
WILL
NEVER
REACH
TO
CERTAINTY
OF
CONSTRAINING
PAULS
OWN
INTENT
PAUL
LIKE
HUMPTY
DUMPTY
AND
ME
AND
ALL
THE
REST
OF
US
WILL
USE
WORDS
IN
WAYS
THAT
ARE
PERSONAL
CHOICES
AND
SOMETIMES
LEAVE
HIS
READERS
PUZZLED
IF
THAT
PUZZLEMENT
LEADS
YOU
TO
GOD
IT
MAY
BE
BLESSED
IF
IT
SHOULD
LEAD
AWAY
AS
SOME
OF
PAULS
WORDS
HAVE
LED
SOME
PEOPLE
THEN
PAULS
INTENSE
COMMUNICATIVE
EFFORT
TO
CONTRIVE
HIS
MEANING
IN
OUR
SOULS
MAY
HAVE
SOME
REGRETABLE
CONSEQUENCES
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
FOUND
PAUL
TO
BE
A
FANTASTICALLY
RELIABLE
GUIDE
IF
I
READ
HIM
IN
THE
LARGE
IF
I
CAN
SEE
HIM
LAY
OUT
HIS
POSITION
IN
DETAIL
AND
HAMMER
IT
HOME
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
I
AM
MUCH
LESS
CERTAIN
ABOUT
HIS
MEANING
IN
HIS
MANY
BRIEF
AND
CRYPTIC
PASSAGES
SUCH
AS
THIS
ONE
IN
MY
USUAL
DISCURSIVE
WAY
I
HAVE
GONE
ON
AT
GREAT
LENGTH
ABOUT
THE
FIRST
OF
MY
INTENDED
METAEXEGETICAL
POINTS
WHAT
WOULD
BE
NEEDED
TO
CONFIRM
THAT
PAUL
A
COINED
OR
B
IN
ANY
CASE
MEANT
THE
WORD
TO
MEAN
THE
SAME
AS
THE
LEVITICUS
PROHIBITION
MY
SECOND
POINT
IS
TO
STIPULATE
THIS
HYPO
THESIS
AND
FOLLOW
UP
WHAT
IT
IMPLIES
FOR
BOTH
HIS
INITIAL
READERS
AND
FOR
LATER
CHRISTIANS
GIVEN
MY
VERBOSITY
THIS
WILL
BE
