RE
AM
I
GOING

TIMOTHY
J
BRENT
WRITES
I
HAVE
STATED
BEFORE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
MYSELF
AN
ATHEIST
BUT
DEFINITELY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
CHRISTIAN
GOD
THE
RECENT
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
ATHEISTS
AND
HELL
COMBINED
WITH
A
POST
TO
ANOTHER
GROUP
TO
THE
EFFECT
OF
YOU
WILL
ALL
GO
TO
HELL
HAS
ME
INTERESTED
IN
THE
CONSENSUS
AS
TO
HOW
A
GOD
MIGHT
JUDGE
MEN
AS
A
CATHOLIC
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
A
JEW
BUDDHIST
ETC
MIGHT
GO
TO
HEAVEN
BUT
OBVIOUSLY
SOME
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THIS
EVEN
MORE
SEE
ATHEISTS
AND
PAGANS
I
ASSUME
I
WOULD
BE
LUMPED
INTO
THIS
CATEGORY
TO
BE
HELLBOUND
I
KNOW
YOU
BELIEVE
ONLY
GOD
CAN
JUDGE
AND
I
DO
NOT
ASK
YOU
TO
JUST
FOR
YOUR
OPINIONS
EXCELLENT
QUESTION
TIMOTHY
I
HPOE
THE
ANSWERS
YOU
GET
WILL
BE
SATISFACTORY
AS
WE
CAN
NOT
UNDERSTAND
THE
MIND
OF
GOD
BUT
TO
ATTEMPT
TO
ANSWER
YOU
CLEARLY
GOD
OF
THE
BIBLE
HAS
GIVEN
US
HUMANS
RELATIVLY
LITTLE
ABOUT
HOW
HE
INTENDS
TO
JUDGE
MANKIND
THE
FIRST
TEST
IS
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
BELEIVED
THAT
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
THE
SON
OF
GOD
AND
THAT
HIS
DEATH
AND
RESURRECTION
WAS
SUFFICENT
TO
SERVE
JUSTICE
FOR
ALL
THE
ACTS
WE
COMMIT
THAT
ARE
WRONG
IN
THE
EYES
OF
GOD
THE
BIBLE
CALLS
THIS
SIN
FOR
THOSE
WHO
DIE
BEFORE
THE
END
OF
THE
WORLDHAVE
ALREADY
DIED
IT
IS
MORE
COMPLICATED
TO
EXPLAIN
WITHOUT
LAPSING
IN
TO
CLICHE
GOD
MUST
JUDGE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
BAASIS
OF
THEIR
WORKS
IN
THIS
WORLD
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
NO
PLUS
AND
MINUS
SYSTEM
FOR
GOD
HE
HAS
DECLARED
THAT
HE
CAN
NOT
TOLERATE
SPIRITUAL
IMPERFECTION
THUS
HE
CAN
ONLY
BASED
YOUR
WORTHINESS
TO
LIVE
WITH
HIM
ON
THE
WRONG
IN
YOUR
LIFE
GOOD
PEOPLE
YES
EVEN
CHRISTIANS
ARE
GOING
TO
CONSTANTLY
SIN
BEFORE
GOD
THE
CHRISTIAN
HOEVER
THANKS
GOD
THAT
CHRIST
HAS
GIVEN
HIS
LIFE
FOR
HIS
SINS
PENALTY
THE
PROSCRIBED
PUNISHMENT
FOR
SIN
IS
DEATH
JUST
AS
THE
PROSCRIBED
PUNISHMENT
FOR
ROBBERY
IS
TIME
IN
JAIL
GOD
THEN
CANNOT
ASK
FOR
ANYTHING
BUT
PUNISHEMENT
FOR
THOSE
SINS
HE
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
CONDEM
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
IN
JOHN
THAT
GOD
DID
NOT
SEND
HIS
SON
IN
TO
THE
WORD
TO
CONDEM
IT
BUT
THAT
THROUGH
HIM
IT
MIGHT
BE
SAVED
WHEN
I
REALIZE
THAT
I
HAVE
SINNED
AND
I
DO
WITH
PAINFUL
REGULARITY
I
MUST
APPROACH
GOD
AND
ASK
HIM
TO
NOT
HOLD
THEW
SIN
AGAINST
ME
I
HAVE
THAT
RIGHT
AND
PRIVLIGE
ONLY
BECAUSE
OF
CHRIST
AS
FOR
JEWS
THEY
ARE
PROMISED
THAT
THEY
MUST
BELIEVE
ON
THE
MESSIAH
WHO
WOULD
COME
AND
DIS
COME
IN
JESUS
OF
NAZERETH
MUSLIMS
I
FEAR
HAVE
BEEN
GIVEN
A
LIE
FROM
THE
FATER
OF
LIES
SATAN
THEY
NEED
CHRIST
AS
DO
US
ALL
FOR
THOSE
WHO
DONT
HAVE
THAT
RIGHT
IN
THE
VIEW
OF
THE
BIBLE
THEY
STAND
OLONE
IN
THEIR
DEFENSE
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
HELL
I
CAN
NOT
ANSWER
THAT
FOR
YOU
I
CAN
ONLY
SAY
THAT
PERHAPS
IT
IS
EAISER
TO
ASK
AND
ANSWER
HOW
CAN
I
NOT
GO
TO
HELL
THAT
STEP
IS
MUCH
MORE
REWARDING
