a
few
of
the
verses
that
pertain
to
homosexuality
homosexual
christians
have
indeed
checked
out
these
verses
some
of
them
are
used
against
us
only
through
incredibly
perverse
interpretations
others
simply
do
not
address
the
issues
you
would
seem
to
be
more
in
need
of
a
careful
and
spiritled
course
in
exegesis

prooftexting
about

nothing
about
