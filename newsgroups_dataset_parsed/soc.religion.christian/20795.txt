RE
KNOWING
GODS
WILL
HI
I
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
BIBLE
COULD
YOU
TELL
ME
THE
RELATIONS
OF
CHRISTIANS
WITH
NONCHRISTIANS
IN
BIBLE
HOW
SHOULD
BE
THE
RELATIONS
OF
CHRISTIAN
NATIONS
WITH
EACH
OTHER
AND
THE
RELATIONS
OF
CHRISTIAN
NATIONS
WITH
OTHER
NATIONS
WHO
ARE
NOT
CHRISTIANS
THE
OTHER
QUESTION
IS
ABOUT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
RELIGION
IN
BIBLE
DOES
THE
RELIGION
OF
GOD
INCLUDE
AND
NECESSITATE
ANY
LAW
TO
BE
EXTRACTED
FROM
BIBLE
OR
IS
THE
RELIGION
ONLY
A
BELIEF
AND
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
GOVERNMENT
SIDES
IF
FOR
EXAMPLE
ANY
GOVERNMENT
OR
A
NATION
IS
ONE
OF
THE
WRONGDOINGS
ACCORDING
TO
BIBLE
HOW
SHOULD
THEY
BE
TREATED
IS
THERE
ANY
STATEMENT
IN
BIBLE
SAYING
THAT
BIBLE
IS
A
GUIDE
FOR
EVERY
ASPECTS
OF
LIFE
THANK
YOU
BEYTULLAH
