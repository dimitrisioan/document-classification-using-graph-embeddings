therefore
babies
are
born
in
such
a
state
that
should
they
die
they
are
cuf
off
from
god
and
put
in
hell
oh
that
must
explain
matthew
in
that
hour
came
the
disciples
unto
jesus
saying
who
then
is
greatest
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
he
called
to
him
a
little
child
and
set
him
in
the
midst
of
them
and
said
verily
i
say
unto
you
except
ye
turn
and
become
as
little
children
ye
shall
in
no
wise
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
even
so
it
is
not
the
will
of
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
that
one
of
these
little
ones
should
perish
nice
thing
about
the
bible
you
dont
have
to
invent
a
bunch
of
convoluted
rationalizations
to
understand
it
unlike
your
arguments
for
original
sin
face
it
original
sin
was
thought
up
long
after
the
bible
had
been
written
and
has
no
basis
from
the
scriptures
