WHEN
ARE
TWO
PEOPLE
MARRIED
LISTOWNER
I
HAVE
SENT
THIS
TO
MR
ANDERSON
PRIVATELY
POST
IT
ONLY
IF
YOU
THINK
IT
OF
GENERAL
INTEREST
HERE
IS
A
COPY
OF
SOMETHING
I
WROTE
FOR
ANOTHER
LIST
YOU
MAY
FIND
IT
RELEVANT
A
LISTMEMBER
ASKS
WHAT
MAKES
COMMONLAW
MARRIAGES
WRONG
A
COMMONLAW
MARRIAGE
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
WRONG
IN
ITSELF
THERE
IS
NOTHING
IN
THE
BIBLE
OLD
OR
NEW
TESTAMENT
ABOUT
GETTING
MARRIED
BY
A
PREACHER
OR
BY
A
PRIEST
JEWISH
OR
CHRISTIAN
AND
IN
FACT
JEWISH
PRIESTS
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
ANY
CONNECTION
WITH
WEDDINGS
THERE
IS
A
COMMON
NOTION
THAT
THE
MARRIAGE
IS
PERFORMED
BY
THE
CLERGYMAN
IN
FACT
THE
TRADITIONAL
CHRISTIAN
VIEW
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
WEST
IS
THAT
THE
BRIDE
AND
GROOM
ARE
THE
MINISTERS
OF
THE
MARRIAGE
AND
THAT
THE
CLERGYMAN
IS
THERE
ONLY
AS
A
WITNESS
HOWEVER
THE
ESSENTIAL
INGREDIENT
OF
A
MARRIAGE
IS
MUTUAL
COMMITMENT
TWO
PERSONS
ARE
CONSIDERED
TO
BE
MARRIED
IF
AND
ONLY
IF
THEY
HAVE
BOUND
THEMSELVES
BY
MUTUAL
PROMISES
TO
LIVE
TOGETHER
AS
HUSBAND
AND
WIFE
FORSAKING
ALL
OTHERS
TILL
DEATH
DO
THEM
PART
THE
REASON
WHY
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
REASON
TO
BE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
WHO
IS
MARRIED
TO
WHOM
HAVE
ALWAYS
INSISTED
ON
SOME
KIND
OF
PUBLIC
CEREMONY
IS
IN
ORDER
THAT
SOCIETY
AND
THE
COUPLE
THEMSELVES
MAY
BE
CLEAR
ABOUT
WHETHER
A
COMMITMENT
HAS
BEEN
MADE
SUPPOSE
THAT
WE
DO
AWAY
WITH
THE
PUBLIC
CEREMONY
THE
STANDARD
VOWS
ETC
INSTEAD
WE
HAVE
A
MAN
AND
A
WOMAN
SETTLING
DOWN
TO
LIVE
TOGETHER
AFTER
A
YEAR
OR
SO
THE
MAN
SAYS
TO
THE
WOMAN
HEY
HONEY
IT
WAS
GREAT
WHILE
IT
LASTED
BUT
I
THINK
ITS
TIME
TO
MOVE
ON
SHE
SAYS
WHAT
ARE
YOU
TALKING
ABOUT
HE
SAYS
I
AM
LEAVING
YOU
AND
LOOKING
FOR
SOMEONE
PRETTIER
AND
YOUNGER
SHE
SAYS
BUT
YOU
CANT
WE
ARE
MARRIED
HE
SAYS
WHAT
ARE
YOU
TALKING
ABOUT
WE
NEVER
GOT
MARRIED
SHE
SAYS
I
REMEMBER
DISTINCTLY
WHAT
YOU
SAID
TO
ME
THE
NIGHT
WE
FIRST
MADE
LOVE
YOU
SAID
MY
LOVE
FOR
YOU
IS
AS
DEEP
AS
THE
OCEAN
AS
ETERNAL
AS
THE
STARS
AS
LONG
AS
I
LIVE
I
AM
YOURS
UTTERLY
AND
COMPLETELY
WHEN
I
LIE
ON
MY
DEATHBED
MY
LAST
FEEBLE
BREATH
WILL
UTTER
YOUR
NAME
MY
HE
SAYS
OH
THAT
THAT
WAS
JUST
RHETORIC
JUST
POETRY
WHEN
A
MAN
IS
IN
A
ROMANTIC
MOOD
HE
IS
BOUND
TO
SAY
ALL
KINDS
OF
SILLY
THINGS
LIKE
THAT
YOU
MUSTNT
TAKE
THEM
LITERALLY
AND
THAT
IS
WHY
YOU
HAVE
AN
INSISTENCE
ON
A
FORMAL
CEREMONY
THAT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
PUBLIC
RECORD
THE
CHURCH
INSISTS
ON
IT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
HER
DUTY
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
TO
GIVE
MORAL
ADVICE
AND
YOU
CANNOT
GIVE
A
MAN
MORAL
ADVICE
ABOUT
HIS
RELATIONS
WITH
A
WOMAN
IF
YOU
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHO
IS
MARRIED
TO
WHOM
IF
ANYBODY
AND
VICE
VERSA
THE
STATE
INSISTS
ON
IT
SINCE
THE
STATE
HAS
A
CONCERN
WITH
PROPERTY
RIGHTS
WITH
CHILD
CARE
AND
SUPPORT
AND
THEREFORE
NEEDS
TO
KNOW
WHO
HAS
MADE
WHAT
COMMITMENTS
TO
WHOM
PROSPECTIVE
FATHERSINLAW
INSIST
ON
IT
BECAUSE
THEY
DONT
WANT
THEIR
DAUGHTERS
SEDUCED
AND
ABANDONED
PROSPECTIVE
SPOUSES
INSIST
ON
IT
BECAUSE
THEY
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THEY
KNOW
WHETHER
WHAT
THEY
ARE
HEARING
IS
A
REAL
COMMITMENT
OR
JUST
POETRY
AND
PERSONS
MAKING
VOWS
THEMSELVES
INSIST
ON
MAKING
THEM
FORMALLY
AND
PUBLICLY
IN
ORDER
THAT
THEY
MAY
BE
CLEAR
IN
THEIR
OWN
MINDS
ABOUT
WHAT
IT
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
AND
MAY
KNOW
THEMSELVES
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
JUST
RHETORIC
THIS
IS
THE
REAL
THING
HENCE
THE
INSISTENCE
ON
A
FORMAL
PUBLIC
EXPLICIT
AVOWAL
OF
THE
MARRIAGE
COMMITMENT
THE
CHURCH
GOES
FURTHER
AND
INSISTS
THAT
WHEN
CHRISTIANS
MARRY
A
CLERGYMAN
SHALL
BE
PRESENT
AT
THE
WEDDING
AND
RECORD
THE
VOWS
ON
BEHALF
OF
THE
CHURCH
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
HAVE
A
VALID
WEDDING
WITHOUT
A
CLERGYMAN
BUT
IN
ORDER
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THE
COUPLE
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
THE
CHRISTIAN
TEACHING
ABOUT
MARRIAGE
IS
AND
THAT
THEY
ARE
IN
FACT
PROMISING
TO
BE
MARRIED
IN
A
CHRISTIAN
SENSE
THE
CHURCH
ALSO
PREFERS
A
STANDARD
MARRIAGE
VOW
AND
IS
WARY
OF
LETTING
COUPLES
WRITE
THEIR
OWN
VOWS
FOR
MUCH
THE
SAME
REASON
THAT
LAWYERS
PREFER
STANDARD
TERMINOLOGY
WHEN
THEY
DRAW
UP
A
WILL
OR
A
CONTRACT
CERTAIN
LANGUAGE
HAS
BEEN
REPEATEDLY
USED
IN
WILLS
AND
ONE
CAN
BE
SURE
HOW
THE
COURTS
WILL
INTERPRET
IT
TRY
TO
SAY
THE
SAME
THING
IN
YOUR
OWN
WORDS
AND
YOU
MAY
FIND
THAT
THE
PROBATE
JUDGES
INTERPRETATION
OF
THEM
IS
NOT
AT
ALL
WHAT
YOU
INTENDED
SIMILARLY
THE
CHURCH
PREFERS
TO
AVOID
ENDLESS
DEBATES
ABOUT
WHETHER
YOU
ARE
MY
MAIN
SQUEEZE
AND
I
AM
HERE
FOR
THE
LONG
HAUL
DO
IN
FACT
COVER
THE
SAME
TERRITORY
AS
FORSAKING
ALL
OTHERS
AND
TILL
DEATH
DO
US
PART
THIS
TOPIC
HAS
COME
UP
ON
THE
LIST
BEFORE
IS
THERE
ANY
TOPIC
THAT
HASNT
ONE
LISTMEMBER
WAS
ASKING
IF
A
COUPLE
LOVE
EACH
OTHER
AND
ARE
LIVING
TOGETHER
ISNT
THAT
MARRIAGE
IN
THE
EYES
OF
GOD
EVENTUALLY
SOMEONE
ASKED
IN
THAT
CASE
WHAT
IS
THEIR
STATUS
IF
THEY
BREAK
UP
IS
THAT
THE
MORAL
EQUIVALENT
OF
GETTING
A
DIVORCE
ARE
THEY
IN
A
RELATIONSHIP
THAT
GOD
FORBIDS
EITHER
OF
THEM
TO
WALK
OUT
ON
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTIONER
SAID
GOOD
GRIEF
I
NEVER
THOUGHT
OF
THAT
IN
FACT
THERE
ARE
REASONABLE
GROUNDS
FOR
SUSPECTING
THAT
SOMEONE
WHO
SAYS
WE
DONT
NEED
A
PIECE
OF
PAPER
OR
A
CEREMONY
IN
FRONT
OF
A
JUDGE
OR
A
PREACHER
IN
ORDER
TO
SHOW
THAT
WE
LOVE
EACH
OTHER
IS
TRYING
TO
HAVE
IT
BOTH
WAYS
TO
HAVE
THE
ADVANTAGES
OF
MARRIAGE
PLUS
THE
OPTION
OF
CHANGING
HIS
MIND
WITH
A
MINIMUM
OF
BOTHER
AT
THIS
POINT
SOMEONE
MAY
SAY
NONE
OF
THIS
APPLIES
TO
ME
AND
MY
MATE
WE
ARE
QUITE
CLEAR
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
HAVE
ASSUMED
A
LIFELONG
COMMITMENT
FOR
BETTER
OR
WORSE
FORSAKING
ALL
OTHERS
TILL
DEATH
US
DO
PART
SO
IN
OUR
CASE
NO
CEREMONY
IS
NEEDED
TO
THIS
MY
REPLY
WOULD
BE
THE
REASON
FOR
REQUIRING
A
DRIVERS
LICENSE
IS
TO
KEEP
DANGEROUS
DRIVERS
OFF
THE
ROAD
WHAT
IS
WRONG
IN
ITSELF
IS
NOT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
UNLICENSED
DRIVERS
BUT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
DANGEROUS
DRIVERS
HOWEVER
TESTING
AND
LICENSING
DRIVERS
IS
AN
OBVIOUS
AND
REASONABLE
MEANS
OF
PURSUING
THE
GOAL
OF
REDUCING
THE
NUMBER
OF
DANGEROUS
DRIVERS
ON
THE
ROAD
THEREFORE
THE
STATE
RIGHTLY
MAKES
AND
ENFORCES
SUCH
LAWS
AND
YOU
THE
CITIZEN
HAVE
A
POSITIVE
MORAL
OBLIGATION
TO
REFRAIN
FROM
DRIVING
WITHOUT
A
LICENSE
NO
MATTER
HOW
MUCH
OF
A
HOTSHOT
BEHIND
THE
WHEEL
YOU
THINK
YOU
ARE
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
WE
HAVE
A
LISTMEMBER
WHO
KNOWS
A
COUPLE
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
LIVING
TOGETHER
FOR
AROUND
YEARS
HE
ASKS
AT
WHAT
POINT
DID
THEY
STOP
FORNICATING
AND
START
BEING
MARRIED
I
ANSWER
AT
THE
POINT
IF
ANY
WHERE
THEY
BOTH
DEFINITELY
AND
EXPLICITLY
ACCEPTED
AN
OBLIGATION
TO
BE
FAITHFUL
TO
EACH
OTHER
FOR
BETTER
OR
WORSE
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
BOTH
LIVED
IF
THEY
HAVE
ACCEPTED
SUCH
AN
OBLIGATION
WHAT
ARE
THEIR
REASONS
FOR
NOT
BEING
WILLING
TO
DECLARE
IT
IN
FRONT
OF
SAY
A
JUSTICE
OF
THE
PEACE
YOURS
