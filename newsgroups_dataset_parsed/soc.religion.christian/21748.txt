CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
PART
OF
THIS
IS
A
CONTINUATION
OF
AN
EARLIER
POST
MLSPANIXCOM
MICHAEL
SIEMON
WRITES
FOR
THOSE
CHRISTIANS
WHO
DO
THINK
THAT
SOME
PARTS
OF
LEVITICUS
CAN
BE
LAW
FOR
CHRISTIANS
WHILE
OTHERS
ARE
NOT
EVEN
TO
BE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
IT
IS
INCUMBENT
ON
YOU
IN
EVERY
CASE
HANDLED
ON
ITS
OWN
MERITS
TO
DETERMINE
WHY
YOU
PICK
ONE
AND
IGNORE
ANOTHER
I
FRANKLY
THINK
THE
WHOLE
EFFORT
MISGUIDED
REREAD
PAUL
NO
DOUBT
I
AM
FREE
TO
DO
ANYTHING
BUT
CHRISTIANS
HAVE
A
CRITERION
TO
USE
FOR
MAKING
OUR
JUDGMENTS
ON
THIS
THE
GREAT
COMMANDMENT
OF
LOVE
FOR
GOD
AND
NEIGHBOR
IF
YOU
CANNOT
GO
THROUGH
LEVITICUS
AND
DECIDE
EACH
COMMAND
THERE
ON
THAT
BASIS
THEN
YOUR
OWN
ARBITRARY
SELECTION
FROM
IT
IS
SIMPLY
IDIOSYNCRACY
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
IT
IS
REMARKABLY
OFFENSIVE
TO
SAY
I
NOTICE
THAT
THE
VERSE
FORBIDDING
BESTIALITY
IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWS
THE
VERSE
PROHIBITING
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
I
AM
SORRY
YOU
FOUND
THIS
OFFENSIVE
IT
WAS
NOT
MY
INTENT
TO
OFFEND
I
WAS
LEADING
UP
TO
ANOTHER
POINT
WHICH
I
DISCUSS
IN
MORE
DETAIL
BELOW
WELL
LATIDA
SO
WHAT
THIS
IS
ALMOST
AS
SLIMEY
AN
ARGUMENT
AS
THE
ONE
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
RAPE
I
KNOW
OF
NO
ONE
WHO
ARGUES
SERIOUSLY
THOUGH
ONE
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
JOKERS
IN
DEFENSE
OF
BESTIALITY
IT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
IRRELEVANT
AND
INCOMPARABLE
TO
THE
ISSUES
GAY
CHRISTIANS
DO
RAISE
WHICH
CONCERN
SEXUAL
ACTIVITY
WITHIN
COMMITTED
CONSENSUAL
HUMAN
ADULT
REALTIONSHIPS
SO
THAT
YOUR
BRINGING
IT
UP
IS
NO
MORE
RELEVANT
THAN
THE
LAWS
OF
KASHRUT
IF
YOU
CANNOT
ADDRESS
THE
ACTUAL
ISSUES
YOU
ARE
BEING
BLOODY
DISHONEST
IN
TRAILING
THIS
RED
HERRING
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
WORLD
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
ADDRESS
BESTIALITY
THAT
IS
YOUR
BUSINESS
NOT
MINE
AND
ATTEMPTING
TO
TORPEDO
A
SERIOUS
ISSUE
BY
USING
WHAT
IS
IN
OUR
CULTURE
A
RIDICULOUS
JOKE
SHOWS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
NO
INTEREST
IN
HEARING
US
AS
HUMAN
BEINGS
YOU
WANT
TO
DISMISS
US
AND
USE
THE
SLEAZIEST
MEANS
YOU
CAN
THINK
OF
TO
DO
SO
I
CAN
SEE
YOU
HAVE
A
REVULSION
FOR
BESTIALITY
THAT
FAR
EXCEEDS
MY
DISTASTE
FOR
HOMOSEXUALITY
CERTAINLY
IF
I
SPOKE
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALITY
THE
WAY
YOU
SPEAK
OF
BESTIALITY
NOBODY
WOULD
HAVE
ANY
TROUBLE
LABELLING
ME
A
HOMOPHOBE
LET
ME
ASK
THIS
GENTLY
WHY
ARE
YOU
SO
JUDGEMENTAL
OF
OTHER
PEOPLES
SEXUAL
PREFERENCES
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
NO
DOUBT
I
AM
FREE
TO
DO
ANYTHING
I
THINK
YOU
HAVE
A
SERIOUS
DOUBLE
STANDARD
HERE
WHEN
YOU
DESCRIBE
A
COMPARISON
BETWEEN
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
BESTIALITY
AS
SLIMEY
AND
SLEAZY
YOU
ARE
MAKING
AN
IMPLICIT
JUDGEMENT
THAT
BESTIALITY
IS
PERVERTED
SINFUL
DISGUSTING
UNNATURALIN
SHORT
ALL
THE
THINGS
THAT
SOCIETY
ONCE
THOUGHT
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALITY
NOT
ALL
PEOPLE
SHARE
YOUR
VIEW
YOU
CLAIM
NOT
TO
KNOW
ANY
SINCERE
ZOOPHILES
BUT
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
DO
NOT
EXIST
THEY
EVEN
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
NEWSGROUP
ALTSEXBESTIALITY
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
ACCUSE
THEM
ALL
OF
BEING
MERE
JOKERS
I
NOTICE
YOU
DELETED
THE
MAIN
POINT
OF
MY
COMMENT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ONLY
BIBLICAL
CONDEMNATIONS
OF
BESTIALITY
OCCUR
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
THE
LEVITICAL
PROHIBITIONS
AGAINST
HOMOSEXUALITY
WHILE
THERE
ARE
SOME
NEW
TESTAMENT
PASSAGES
THAT
CAN
ARGUABLY
BE
TAKEN
AS
CONDEMNING
HOMOSEXUALITY
THERE
ARE
NONE
THAT
CONDEMN
BESTIALITY
ONE
OF
YOUR
MAIN
POINTS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
ACCEPTABLE
DUE
TO
THE
LACK
OF
ANY
CLEAR
NEW
TESTAMENT
STATEMENTS
AGAINST
IT
IF
THIS
IS
A
VALID
ARGUMENT
THEN
SHOULD
NOT
CHRISTIAN
ZOOPHILIA
BE
MADE
THAT
MUCH
MORE
ACCEPTABLE
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
MAKES
NO
REFERENCE
CLEAR
OR
UNCLEAR
TO
THE
SUBJECT
AT
ALL
I
AM
QUITE
SERIOUS
HERE
IF
I
AM
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
BIBLICALLY
ACCEPTABLE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
THEN
I
AM
GOING
TO
BE
FAIR
AND
APPLY
THE
SAME
STANDARDS
TO
EVERYONE
ELSES
DECLARED
SEXUAL
PREFERENCES
AS
WELL
IF
THE
ARGUMENTS
YOU
MAKE
FOR
HOMOSEXUALITY
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
OTHER
SEXUAL
PREFERENCES
AS
WELL
IM
GOING
TO
APPLY
THEM
AND
SEE
WHAT
COMES
UP
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
TORPEDO
A
SERIOUS
ISSUE
BY
USING
WHAT
YOU
LABEL
A
RIDICULOUS
JOKE
I
POSTED
A
QUESTION
ABOUT
HOW
WE
SHOULD
INTERPRET
BIBLICAL
GUIDELINES
FOR
CHRISTIAN
SEXUALITY
AND
I
DONT
THINK
SUCH
A
QUESTION
IS
IRRELEVANT
IN
A
GROUP
CALLED
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
THE
BIBLE
DISCUSSES
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
BESTIALITY
TOGETHER
IN
THE
SAME
CONTEXT
AND
THEREFORE
I
FEEL
I
HAVE
A
GOOD
PRECEDENT
FOR
DOING
THE
SAME
JESUS
AND
PAUL
BOTH
EXPOUND
VERY
EXPLICTLY
AND
IN
CONSIDERABLE
LENGTH
THE
CENTRAL
LINCHPIN
OF
CHRISTIAN
MORAL
THOUGHT
WE
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
LOVE
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
ALL
ELSE
DEPENDS
ON
THAT
GAY
AND
LESBIAN
CHRIST
IANS
CHALLENGE
YOU
TO
ADDRESS
THE
ISSUE
ON
THOSE
TERMS
AND
ALL
WE
GET
IN
RETURN
ARE
CHEAP
DEBATE
TRICKS
ATTEMPTING
TO
SIDETRACK
THE
ISSUES
I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
IT
MAKES
ANY
DIFFERENCE
BUT
FOR
THE
RECORD
THIS
IS
NOT
A
SIDE
ISSUE
FOR
ME
I
BELIEVE
LOVING
ONE
ANOTHER
INCLUDES
NOT
ENCOURAGING
PEOPLE
TO
DEFILE
THEMSELVES
THEREFORE
IT
IS
OF
HIGH
IMPORTANCE
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
GOD
REGARDS
CERTAIN
SEXUAL
ACTS
AS
DEFILING
I
CAN
READ
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
THAT
GOD
HAS
JOINED
TOGETHER
HETEROSEXUAL
COUPLES
AND
THAT
THE
MARRIAGE
BED
IS
UNDEFILED
I
CAN
READ
IN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
THAT
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
AND
BESTIALITY
DEFILE
A
PERSON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THAT
PERSON
IS
UNDER
THE
LAW
IF
GAY
CHRISTIANS
CAN
VALIDLY
PUT
ASIDE
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
STANDARDS
OF
DEFILEMENT
THEN
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
SO
THAT
I
CAN
FAIRLY
APPLY
IT
TO
ALL
THE
SEXUAL
PRACTICES
THAT
DEFILED
A
PERSON
IN
THE
OLD
DAYS
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
RIGHT
TO
TAKE
JUST
BITS
AND
PIECES
OF
THE
LAW
AND
TRY
AND
APPLY
THEM
TO
CHRISTIANS
TODAY
EG
BESTIALITY
STILL
DEFILES
YOU
BUT
HOMOSEXUALITY
DOESNT
THAT
WAS
PRETTY
MUCH
WHAT
YOU
SAID
EARLIER
RIGHT
YOU
USED
DIFFERENT
EXAMPLES
BUT
I
THINK
YOU
SAID
ESSENTIALLY
THE
SAME
THING
ABOUT
IT
BEING
WRONG
TO
APPLY
ONLY
CERTAIN
PARTS
OF
THE
LAW
TO
CHRISTIANS
CHRISTIANS
NO
DOUBT
VERY
SINCERE
ONES
KEEP
SHOWING
UP
HERE
AND
IN
EVERY
CORNER
OF
USENET
AND
THE
WORLD
AND
ALL
THEY
EVER
DO
IS
SPOUT
THESE
SAME
OLD
VERSES
WHICH
THEY
OBVIOUSLY
HAVE
NEVER
THOUGHT
ABOUT
MAYBE
NEVER
EVEN
READ
IN
TOTAL
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
ISSUES
RAISED
SLANDERING
US
WITH
THE
VILEST
CHARGES
OF
CHILD
ABUSE
OR
WHATEVER
THEIR
PERFERVID
MINDS
CAN
MANAGE
TO
CONJURE
UP
TOSSING
OUT
RED
HERRINGS
WITH
THEY
SUPPOSE
GREAT
EMOTIONAL
FORCE
TO
CAUSE
READERS
TO
DISMISS
OUR
WITNESS
WITHOUT
EVEN
TAKING
THE
TROUBLE
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
IT
IS
IT
WAS
NOT
MY
INTENT
TO
STIR
UP
SUCH
AN
EMOTIONAL
REACTION
I
PERSONALLY
DONT
GET
ALL
THAT
UPSET
DISCUSSING
ALTERNATIVES
TO
THE
MONOGAMOUS
HETEROSEXUAL
ORIENTATION
IM
AFRAID
I
NAIVELY
ASSUMED
THAT
OTHERS
WOULD
HAVE
A
SIMILAR
ATTITUDE
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
I
HAVE
NEVER
INTENDED
TO
EQUATE
HOMOSEXUALITY
WITH
CHILD
ABUSE
I
HAVE
MERELY
NOTED
THAT
FOR
ALL
THE
LACK
OF
CLEAR
NT
CONDEMNATION
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
THERE
IS
AN
EVEN
GREATER
LACK
OF
NT
CONDEMNATION
OR
EVEN
MENTION
OF
BESTIALITY
A
PRACTICE
WHICH
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
EG
ON
ALTSEXBESTIALITY
CONSIDER
TO
BE
THEIR
TRUE
SEXUAL
ORIENTATION
SUCH
BEHAVIOR
SHOULD
SHAME
ANYONE
WHO
CLAIMS
TO
HAVE
SEEN
TRUTH
IN
CHRIST
WHY
FOR
GODS
PRECIOUS
SAKE
DO
YOU
PEOPLE
QUOTE
IRRELEVANT
VERSES
TO
CONDEMN
PEOPLE
YOU
DONT
KNOW
AND
WONT
EVEN
TAKE
THE
TROUBLE
TO
LISTEN
TO
BEFORE
YOU
START
YOUR
CONDEMNATIONS
IS
THAT
LOVING
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
GOD
FORBID
IS
THAT
HOW
YOU
OBEY
THE
REPEATED
COMMANDS
TO
NOT
JUDGE
OR
CONDEMN
OTHERS
CHRIST
AND
PAUL
SPEND
ORDERS
OF
MAGNITUDE
MORE
TIME
IN
INSISTING
ON
THIS
THAN
THE
HALFDOZEN
OBSCURE
WORDS
IN
PAUL
THAT
YOU
ARE
SO
BLOODY
READY
TO
TAKE
AS
LICENSE
TO
DO
WHAT
GOD
TELLS
YOU
NOT
TO
DO
WHY
FOR
GODS
SAKE
QUOTE
FROM
JOHN
OMITTED
FOR
BREVITY
THIS
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
QUESTION
AND
I
PRAY
THAT
YOU
WILL
NOT
TREAT
IT
AS
A
MERE
RHETORICAL
QUESTION
BUT
WILL
GENUINELY
SEEK
TO
DISCOVER
AND
UNDERSTAND
THE
ANSWER
I
RECOMMEND
YOU
BEGIN
WITH
A
LITTLE
INTROSPECTION
INTO
WHY
YOU
YOURSELF
HAVE
MUCH
THE
SAME
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
ZOOPHILIA
WHY
DO
YOU
FIND
BESTIALITY
SO
REPUGNANT
THAT
YOU
REGARD
IT
AS
SLANDEROUS
TO
EVEN
MENTION
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
OTHER
ALTERNATIVE
SEXUAL
ORIENTATIONS
WHY
DO
YOU
NOT
APPLY
ALL
THE
SAME
VERSES
ABOUT
LOVE
AND
TOLERANCE
TO
ZOOPHILES
THE
WAY
YOU
APPLY
THEM
TO
HOMOSEXUALS
IS
IT
BECAUSE
YOU
AUTOMATICALLY
EXPERIENCE
A
SUBJECTIVE
FEELING
OF
REVULSION
AT
THE
THOUGHT
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
THE
SAME
EXPERIENCE
AT
THE
THOUGHT
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
IS
IT
BECAUSE
YOU
REGARD
THE
PRACTICE
AS
SOCIALLY
UNACCEPTABLE
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
REGARD
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
SOCIALLY
UNACCEPTABLE
DO
YOU
FEEL
THAT
IT
VIOLATES
THE
TRADITIONAL
JUDEOCHRISTIAN
STANDARD
OF
SEXUAL
MORALITY
MANY
PEOPLE
FEEL
THAT
HOMOSEXUALITY
DOES
DO
YOU
FEEL
THE
BIBLE
CONDEMNS
IT
MANY
PEOPLE
THINK
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
MORE
TO
CONDEMN
HOMOSEXUALITY
THAN
IT
DOES
TO
CONDEMN
BESTIALITY
WHY
THEN
DO
YOU
THINK
COMPARING
BESTIALITY
WITH
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
INSULTING
TO
HOMOSEXUALITY
IF
YOU
CAN
HONESTLY
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
YOU
WILL
HAVE
COME
A
LONG
WAY
TOWARDS
UNDERSTANDING
WHY
MANY
PEOPLE
FEEL
THE
SAME
WAY
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALITY
AS
YOU
FEEL
ABOUT
BESTIALITY
ALSO
PLEASE
NOTE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
IN
ANY
SENSE
CONDEMNING
PEOPLE
I
AM
MERELY
POINTING
OUT
THAT
WHEN
I
READ
THE
BIBLE
I
SEE
CERTAIN
SEXUAL
PRACTICES
THAT
THE
BIBLE
APPEARS
TO
CONDEMN
EG
SEX
OUTSIDE
OF
MARRIAGE
WHEN
I
SAY
I
THINK
ADULTERY
AND
PREMARITAL
SEX
ARE
SINFUL
DO
YOU
TAKE
THAT
AS
ME
FAILING
TO
LOVE
MY
NEIGHBOR
WHEN
YOU
TREAT
BESTIALITY
AS
SOMETHING
DISGUSTING
AND
UNMENTIONABLE
ARE
YOU
DISOBEYING
REPEATED
ORDERS
NOT
TO
JUDGE
OR
CONDEMN
OTHERS
WHEN
YOU
SAY
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
ARE
GUILTY
OF
SINNING
BY
CONDEMNING
YOU
AND
JUDGING
YOU
ARE
YOU
BY
THAT
ACCUSATION
MAKING
YOURSELF
GUILTY
OF
THE
SAME
OFFENSE
OR
ARE
YOU
AND
I
BOTH
SIMPLY
TAKING
NOTE
ABOUT
PRACTICES
THE
BIBLE
BRANDS
AS
SINFUL
AND
LEAVING
THE
JUDGEMENT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
UP
TO
GOD
FOR
LONG
AGES
WE
MANY
OF
US
HAVE
BEEN
CONFUSED
BY
EVIL
COUNSEL
FROM
EVIL
MEN
AND
TOLD
THAT
IF
WE
CAME
TO
THE
LIGHT
WE
WOULD
BE
SHAMED
AND
REJECTED
SOME
OF
US
DESPAIRED
AND
TOOK
TO
COURSES
THAT
PROBABLY
DO
SHOW
A
SINFUL
SHUNNING
OF
GODS
LIGHT
BLESSED
ARE
THOSE
WHOSE
SPIRITS
HAVE
BEEN
CRUSHED
BY
THE
SELFRIGHTEOUS
THEY
SHALL
BE
JUSTIFIED
HOWEVER
WE
HAVE
SEEN
THE
TRUTH
AND
THE
TRUTH
IS
THE
LIGHT
OF
HUMANITY
AND
WE
NOW
KNOW
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
WE
WHO
FEAR
THE
LIGHT
BUT
OUR
ENEMIES
WHO
FEAR
THE
LIGHT
OF
OUR
WITNESS
AND
WILL
DO
EVERYTHING
THEY
CAN
TO
SHADOW
IT
WITH
THE
DARKNESS
OF
FALSE
WITNESS
AGAINST
US
MICHAEL
L
SIEMON
I
SAY
YOU
ARE
GODS
SONS
OF
THE
MLSPANIXCOM
MOST
HIGH
ALL
OF
YOU
NEVERTHELESS
OR
YOU
SHALL
DIE
LIKE
MEN
AND
FALL
MLSULYSSESATTCOM
LIKE
ANY
PRINCE
PSALM
IM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
THE
ABOVE
TWO
PARAGRAPHS
IF
YOU
MEAN
THAT
JESUS
IS
THE
TRUTH
AND
THAT
HE
ACCEPTS
SINNERS
AND
DOES
NOT
REJECT
THEM
THEN
I
AGREE
IF
WE
WERE
NOT
SINNERS
THEN
WE
WOULD
NOT
NEED
A
SAVIOR
OUR
SALVATION
IN
CHRIST
HOWEVER
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
SIN
IS
NOW
IRRELEVANT
FOR
US
AND
WE
CAN
NOW
DO
WHATEVER
WE
WANT
NOR
DOES
CHRISTS
GRACE
MEAN
THAT
THOSE
WHO
REFER
TO
SIN
AS
SIN
ARE
BEING
JUDGEMENTAL
OR
INTOLERANT
I
AM
SPEAKING
IN
GENERAL
TERMS
HERE
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUALITY
IF
THE
BIBLE
CALLS
SOMETHING
SIN
THEN
IT
IS
NOT
UNREASONABLE
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
CALL
IT
SIN
TOO
AS
APPLIED
TO
CHRISTIAN
HOMOSEXUALITY
I
THINK
THE
ONLY
DEFINITIVE
AUTHORITY
ON
CHRISTIAN
SEXUALITY
IS
THE
BIBLE
IF
YOU
MAKE
A
LIST
OF
EVERYTHING
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
EVERY
VERSE
ON
THE
LIST
IS
NEGATIVE
AND
CONDEMNING
AT
WORST
AND
UNCLEAR
AT
BEST
THE
MOST
PROGAY
STATEMENT
YOU
COULD
MAKE
ABOUT
THE
LIST
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
DISPUTE
ABOUT
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
VERSES
WHICH
MANY
PEOPLE
INTERPRET
AS
CONDEMNING
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
THAT
IS
FROM
A
GAY
PERSPECTIVE
THE
MOST
POSITIVE
THING
YOU
CAN
SAY
ABOUT
THE
BIBLES
TREATMENT
OF
HOMOSEXUALITY
IS
THAT
SOME
VERSES
FAIL
TO
CLEARLY
CONDEMN
IT
THATS
IT
JESUS
DECLARED
ALL
FOODS
CLEAN
THE
COUNCIL
AT
JERUSALEM
DECLARED
THAT
GENTILES
WERE
NOT
REQUIRED
TO
KEEP
THE
RITUAL
LAW
BUT
NOBODY
EVER
RECLASSIFIED
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
FROM
BEING
AN
ABOMINATION
DESERVING
OF
DEATH
TO
BEING
AN
ACCEPTED
CHRISTIAN
PRACTICE
YOU
HAVE
VERSES
DESCRIBING
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
AS
AN
ABOMINATION
THAT
DEFILES
BOTH
JEWS
UNDER
THE
LAW
AND
GENTILES
NOT
UNDER
THE
LAW
AND
YOU
HAVE
SOME
VERSES
WHICH
ARE
AT
BEST
NOT
CLEAR
BUT
WHICH
SOME
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
ARE
CLEAR
IN
THEIR
CONDEMNATION
OF
HOMOSEXUAL
BEHAVIOR
AND
THATS
THE
SUM
TOTAL
OF
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
ABOUT
SAMESEX
INTERCOURSE
I
CAN
APPRECIATE
FROM
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
YOUR
DESIRE
TO
HAVE
EVERYTHING
SIMPLE
CUTANDDRIED
BLACKANDWHITE
WHATIWANT
ISOK
AND
THOSEWHOOPPOSEMEAREWICKED
HOWEVER
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THE
BIBLE
MAKES
YOUR
CASE
AS
DEFINITIVELY
AS
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
IT
TO
IN
FACT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IT
SAYS
ANYTHING
POSITIVE
ABOUT
YOUR
CASE
AT
ALL
YES
I
KNOW
THE
VERSES
ABOUT
LOVING
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
NOT
JUDGING
ONE
ANOTHER
BUT
THATS
NOT
REALLY
THE
ISSUE
IS
IT
YOU
KNOW
AND
ADMIT
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL
THINGS
THAT
ARE
SINFUL
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
DO
SINCE
YOU
SAY
IT
IS
WRONG
FOR
CHRISTIANS
TO
CONDEMN
YOU
THEREFORE
THE
ISSUE
IS
WHETHER
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
IS
A
SIN
EVEN
IF
YOU
DO
CHALLENGE
THE
CLARITY
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
VERSES
YOU
ARE
STILL
LEFT
WITH
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ONLY
THING
THE
BIBLE
DOES
SAY
CLEARLY
ABOUT
HOMOSEXUAL
INTERCOURSE
IS
THAT
IT
IS
AN
ABOMINATION
THAT
DEFILES
BOTH
THOSE
WHO
ARE
UNDER
THE
LAW
AND
THOSE
WHO
ARE
NOT
MARK
ACTUALLY
I
DONT
THINK
THE
REACTION
TO
THE
COMPARISION
WITH
BESTIALITY
IS
BASED
ON
BESTIALOPHOBIA
I
THINK
WHAT
HE
REGARDS
AS
SLIMEY
IS
THE
RHETORICAL
APPROACH
OF
CONNECTING
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
BESTIALITY
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
ACCEPT
HOMOSEXUALITY
TAKE
A
RADICAL
APPROACH
TO
THE
LAW
THEY
REGARD
ALL
OF
LEV
AS
NOT
BINDING
ON
CHRISTIANS
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
THERES
NO
WAY
IN
THE
TEXT
TO
SEPARATE
BESTIALITY
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
WEARING
MIXED
FABRICS
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
SUCH
PEOPLE
HAVE
NO
LIMITS
ON
THEIR
CONDUCT
NOR
DOES
IT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
ACCEPT
BESTIALITY
IT
SIMPLY
MEANS
THAT
THEIR
SEXUAL
ETHICS
DOES
NOT
COME
FROM
THE
LAW
AND
PARTICULARLY
NOT
FROM
LEV
