MINDS
OF
CHRIST
NABIL
WROTE
BOTH
FAMILIES
AGREE
THAT
HE
WHO
WILLS
AND
ACTS
IS
ALWAYS
THE
ONE
HYPOSTASIS
OF
THE
LOGOS
INCARNATE
MARHABA
NABIL
IF
WE
POSIT
TWO
MINDS
IN
CHRIST
THE
MIND
OF
THE
LOGOS
AND
THE
MIND
OF
THE
HUMAN
JESUS
THEN
WE
MUST
ADMIT
TWO
WILLS
A
MIND
IS
NOT
A
MIND
WITHOUT
A
WILL
I
KNOW
THIS
HAS
BEEN
DEALT
WITH
IN
PAST
CHURCH
PRNOUNCEMENTS
BUT
THERE
IS
A
PHILOSOPHICAL
PROBLEM
HERE
THAT
SHOULD
EXAMINED
T
V
MORRIS
ARGUED
THAT
THE
INCARNATION
CAN
BE
SEEN
LIKE
THIS
MIND
OF
LOGOS
HERE
THE
MIND
OF
JESUS
IS
CIRCUMSRIBED
BY
GOD
THE
HUMAN
SON
GOD
THE
SON
HAS
COMPLETE
ACCESS
TO
THE
HUMAN
MIND
MIND
BUT
THE
HUMAN
MIND
ONLY
HAS
ACCESS
TO
THE
MIND
OF
GOD
THE
SON
WHEN
THE
SON
ALLOWS
ACCESS
THIS
EXPLAINS
WHY
JESUS
SAID
EVEN
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
THE
TIME
OF
THE
KINGDOM
THE
HUMAN
WILL
ACTED
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
DIVINE
WILL
ACCORDING
TO
FREE
HUMAN
DECISION
BUT
IF
THE
HUMAN
WILL
WOULD
HAVE
DECIDED
DIFFERENTLY
THAN
WHAT
WAS
INTENDED
THE
DIVINE
WILL
WOULD
HAVE
INTERCEDED
BUT
THIS
WAS
NEVER
THE
CASE
HE
EMPLOYS
SOME
VERY
INTERESTING
ANALOGIES
TO
SUPPORT
THE
ONE
PERSONTWO
MIND
THEORY
THE
IDEAS
OF
A
COMPLETELY
HEALTHY
VERSION
OF
SPLIT
PERSONALITY
FROM
THE
FIELD
OF
PSYCHOLOGY
AND
THE
INTRIGUING
IDEAS
OF
BEING
IN
A
DREAM
SEEING
YOURSELF
ACTING
KNOWING
THAT
IS
YOU
BUT
ALSO
BEING
OMNISCIENT
THE
ONE
HYPOSTASIS
WOULD
BE
THE
UNITY
OF
THE
TWO
MINDS
AGREED
BUT
I
AM
STILL
WAITING
FOR
MORRIS
AND
OTHERS
TO
RESPOND
TO
THE
LINGERING
PROBLEM
OF
TWO
MINDS
MAKING
TWO
PERSONS
CHRISTIAN
ANALYTIC
PHILOSOPHERS

BREAKING
NEW
GROUND
IN
EXPLICATING
THE
RATIONALITY
OF
