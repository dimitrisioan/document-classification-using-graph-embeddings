WROTE
THE
NEXT
SUNDAY
THE
SERMON
WAS
ABOUT
JOSHUA
WHERE
THE
ISRAELITES
TAKE
JERICHO
AND
THEN
PROCEED
TO
MASSACRE
EVERYBODY
THERE
EXCEPT
FOR
RAHAB
WHO
HAD
SHELTERED
THE
SPIES
WITH
THOSE
REPORTS
ABOUT
BOSNIA
IN
MY
MIND
I
FELT
UNCOMFORTABLE
ABOUT
THE
MINISTER
SAYING
THAT
THE
MASSACRE
THE
ONE
IN
JOSHUA
WAS
RIGHT
BUT
WHAT
REALLY
BOTHERED
ME
WAS
THAT
IF
I
WAS
GOING
TO
TRY
TAKING
CHRISTIANITY
SERIOUSLY
I
SHOULDNT
BE
SO
TROUBLED
ABOUT
THE
REPORTS
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
IN
BOSNIA
CERTAINLY
MY
SYMPATHIES
SHOULDNT
BE
WITH
THE
MOSLIMS
CONSIDERING
THAT
THE
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
ARE
DESCENDANTS
OF
CHRISTIANS
WHO
UNDER
TURKISH
RULE
CONVERTED
TO
ISLAM
COULD
THE
SERBS
BE
DOING
GODS
WORK
PERHAPS
IT
WOULD
BE
USEFUL
TO
ASK
WHETHER
THOSE
DOING
THE
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
COULD
BE
SAID
TO
BE
LOVING
THOSE
THEY
ARE
KILLING
IN
THE
VERY
ACT
OF
KILLING
DOES
IT
REFLECT
THE
ATTITUDE
OF
GOD
WHO
SENDS
RAIN
TO
BOTH
THE
JUST
AND
THE
UNJUST
IF
NOT
THEN
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
BE
UNCOMFORTABLE
WITH
IT
JESUS
GAVE
HIS
FOLLOWERS
THE
LAW
OF
LOVE
TO
FOLLOW
AND
IT
IS
BY
EXHIBITING
THIS
THAT
DISCIPLES
WILL
BE
KNOWN
DOCTRINAL
OR
POLITICAL
CORRECTNESS
IS
NOT
THE
STANDARD
SO
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
BE
MOVED
AGAINST
THE
SERBS
BECAUSE
THEIR
ANCESTORS
CONVERTED
FROM
CHRISTIANITY
TO
ISLAM
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
AS
A
CHRISTIAN
YOU
SHOULD
BE
TROUBLED
BY
THE
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
PEACE
