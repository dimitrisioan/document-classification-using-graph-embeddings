QUESTION
ABOUT
HELL

DALE
WYTTENBACH
WRITES
WHAT
IS
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
IDEA
OF
HELL
BEING
A
PLACE
OF
ETERNAL
SUFFERING
IF
IT
IS
BIBLICAL
PLEASE
REFERENCE
HERES
MY
TRAIN
OF
THOUGHT
IF
GOD
IS
USING
THE
EARTH
TO
MANUFACTURE
HEAVENLY
BEINGS
THEN
IT
IS
LOGICAL
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
A
CERTAIN
YIELD
AND
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
WASTE
THE
YIELD
GOES
TO
HEAVEN
AND
THE
WASTE
IS
BURNED
DESTROYED
IN
HELL
WHY
IS
IT
NECESSARY
TO
PUNISH
THE
WASTE
RATHER
THAN
JUST
DESTROY
IT
LUKE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
RICH
MAN
AND
LAZARUS
MATTHEW
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
ETERNAL
FIRE
PREPARED
FOR
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
REVELATIONS
AND
REFERENCE
THIS
FIRE
AS
THE
PLACE
WHERE
UNBELIEVERS
ARE
THROWN
MATTHEW
TALKS
ABOUT
BEING
THROWN
INTO
THE
ETERNAL
FIRE
AND
THE
FIRE
OF
HELL
IT
SEEMS
QUITE
CLEAR
THAT
THERE
IS
THIS
PLACE
WHERE
A
FIRE
BURNS
FOREVER
FROM
THE
REVELATIONS
PASSAGES
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
WILL
BE
TORMENTED
THERE
FOREVER
FROM
THE
MATTHEW
PASSAGE
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
ABUNDANTLY
CLEAR
WHETHER
THE
PUNISHMENT
OF
UNBELIEVERS
IS
EVERLASTING
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
FINAL
OR
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
CONTINUAL
FROM
DALES
QUESTION
I
COME
AWAY
WITH
THE
SUGGESTION
THAT
HELL
IF
IT
WERE
SHORT
MIGHT
BE
AN
ACCEPTABLE
ALTERNATIVE
TO
LIVING
FOREVER
WITH
THE
SOURCE
OF
LIFE
PEACE
AND
JOY
IE
THE
UNBELIEVER
CEASES
TO
EXIST
WHEREAS
IF
PUNISHMENT
GOES
ON
CONTINUALLY
THEN
ONE
SHOULD
HAVE
A
GREATER
MOTIVATION
TO
AVOID
IT
IT
DEFINATELY
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
HELL
IS
SOMETHING
WE
WANT
TO
AVOID
REGARDLESS
OF
ITS
EXACT
NATURE
THERE
SEEM
TO
BE
TWO
MAIN
QUESTIONS
IN
DALES
THOUGHT
WHAT
IS
GODS
MAIN
PLAN
ON
EARTH
WHY
IS
CONTINUAL
PUNISHMENT
A
NECESSARY
PART
OF
HELL
AS
OPPOSED
TO
SIMPLY
DESTROYING
COMPLETELY
THOSE
WHO
REFUSE
GOD
I
BELIEVE
THAT
GODS
MAIN
PLAN
IS
TO
HAVE
A
GENUINE
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
PEOPLE
THE
NATURE
OF
HELL
AND
THE
REASONS
FOR
ITS
NATURE
SEEM
A
LOT
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
ASCERTAIN
IT
DOES
SEEM
CLEAR
THAT
HELL
IS
SOMETHING
TO
AVOID
AT
A
MINIMUM
HELL
IS
THE
STATE
ONE
IS
IN
WHEN
ONE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
GOD
IN
THE
BIBLE
I
AM
NOT
AWARE
OF
ANY
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
THE
SPECIFICS
OF
HELL
BEYOND
THE
GENERAL
OF
HOT
UNPLEASANT
AND
TORMENT
FOR
INSTANCE
IT
IS
NOT
DISCUSSED
HOW
IF
AT
ALL
THE
RICH
MAN
CAN
CONTINUALLY
STAY
IN
THE
FIRE
AND
STILL
FEEL
DISCOMFORT
OR
PAIN
OR
WHETHER
THERE
IS
SOME
POINT
AT
WHICH
THE
PAIN
SENSING
ABILITY
IS
BURNED
UP
IF
YOU
CAN
FORGIVE
THE
GRAPHICALNESS
IF
YOU
THROW
A
PHYSICAL
BODY
INTO
A
FIRE
ASSUMING
THE
PERSON
STARTS
OUT
ALIVE
AT
SOME
FAIRLY
QUICK
POINT
THE
NERVES
ARE
DESTROYED
AND
PAIN
IS
NO
LONGER
SENSED
IT
IS
NOT
STATED
WHAT
OCCURS
WHEN
AT
THE
JUDGEMENT
THE
UNBELIEVERS
WHO
ARE
ALREADY
PHYSICALLY
DEAD
ARE
CAST
INTO
HELL
IE
THEY
NO
LONGER
HAVE
A
PHYSICAL
BODY
SO
THEY
CANT
FEEL
PHYSICAL
PAIN
WHAT
COULD
BE
SENSED
CONTINUALLY
IS
THAT
THOSE
IN
HELL
ARE
TO
BE
FOREVER
WITHOUT
GOD
THE
LAZARUSRICH
MAN
PARABLE
IS
TOLD
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
HAVING
THE
LISTENER
THINK
IN
PHYSICAL
TERMS
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
THE
POINT
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WONT
LISTEN
TO
GOD
EVEN
AFTER
HE
RISES
FROM
THE
DEAD
THE
POINT
OF
THE
PARABLE
IS
TO
REACH
THE
HARDHEARTED
HERE
WHO
ARE
NOT
LISTENING
TO
THE
FACT
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
NOR
THE
GOSPEL
ABOUT
JESUS
CHRIST
IT
SEEMS
REASONABLE
TO
ALSO
DRAW
FROM
THE
PARABLE
THAT
HELL
IS
NOT
EVEN
REMOTELY
PLEASANT
PETER
WHITE
DISCLAIMER
NONE
OF
WHAT
IS
WRITTEN
NECESSARILY
REFLECTS
A
VIEW
OF
MY
COMPANY
PHIL
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
CHRIST
AND
THE
POWER
OF
HIS
RESURRECTION
AND
THE
FELLOWSHIP
OF
SHARING
IN
NIV
HIS
SUFFERINGS
BECOMING
LIKE
HIM
IN
HIS
DEATH
