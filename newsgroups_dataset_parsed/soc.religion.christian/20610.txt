ASKS
WHAT
IS
THE
OBJECTION
TO
CELEBRATION
OF
EASTER
THE
OBJECTION
NATURALLY
IS
IN
THE
WAY
IN
WHICH
YOU
PHRASE
IT
EASTER
OR
EASHTAR
OR
ISHTAR
OR
ISHTARTI
OR
OTHER
SPELLINGS
IS
THE
PAGAN
WHORE
GODDESS
OF
FERTILITY
IT
IS
CELEBRATION
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
JESUS
NO
YOU
ARE
THINKING
PERHAPS
OF
RESSURECTION
SUNDAY
I
THINK
TSKTSK
TOO
MUCH
ARGUMENT
ON
NONISSUES
IM
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
AND
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
PEOPLE
CELEBRATE
EASTER
AND
CHRISTMAS
FOR
ITSELF
RATHER
THAN
HOW
IT
RELATES
TO
JESUS
I
DONT
REALLY
CARE
ABOUT
SOME
DIETY
IF
PEOPLE
HAVE
SOME
OTHER
DEFINITION
OF
EASTER
THEN
THATS
THEIR
BUSINESS
DONT
LET
IT
INTERFERE
WITH
MY
EASTER
RESURRECTION
SUNDAY
WHERE
DID
THAT
COME
FROM
IF
PEOPLE
CELEBRATE
EASTER
FOR
THE
CADBURRY
BUNNY
THATS
THEIR
BUSINESS
SO
FROM
THIS
I
INFER
THAT
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENT
RULES
FOR
CHRISTIANS
OF
JEWISH
DESCENT
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
THERE
IS
NEITHER
JEW
NOR
GREEK
SLAVE
NOR
FREE
MALE
NOR
FEMALE
FOR
ALL
ARE
ONE
IN
CHRIST
JESUS
IVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
CURIOUS
ABOUT
THIS
IS
JESUS
IMPORTANT
TO
JEWS
AT
ALL
I
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
THOUGHT
OF
ONLY
AS
A
PROPHET
IF
THATS
TRUE
WHAT
DO
THEY
CELEBRATE
EASTER
FOR
