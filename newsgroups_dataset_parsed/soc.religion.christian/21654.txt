re
new
thought
on
deuterocanonicals
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
when
st
john
or
whomever
wrote
the
book
of
revelation
what
was
then
considered
scripture
was
not
the
same
thing
you
and
i
are
holding
in
our
hands
revelation
was
almost
certainly
written
durin
the
reign
of
domition
sp
ad
thus
it
could
be
argues
that
we
are
all
in
sin
if
we
accept
peter
as
scripture
since
it
was
added
to
the
book
after
the
composition
of
revelation
when
we
are
told
to
add
nothing
more
okay
i
went
back
and
looked
sure
enough
my
hunch
was
right
peter
was
most
likely
written
between
ad
revelation
was
almost
certainly
written
between
ad
odds
are
the
gospel
of
john
was
written
around
ad
best
dates
for
luke
and
acts
are
around
ad
maybe
later
again
this
is
from
footnoted
information
in
the
new
american
bible
the
best
translation
ive
come
across
in
regards
to
giving
complete
historical
information
about
each
book
mike
of
course
the
folks
who
youre
arguing
with
almost
certainly
do
not
accept
peter
as
being
pseudonymous
in
that
case
theyd
have
to
date
it
far
earlier
than
this
clh
