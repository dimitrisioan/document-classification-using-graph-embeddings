RE
CHRISTIANITY
AND
REPEATED
LIVES
IN
ARTICLE
WAYQUBACUK
WRITES
SINGLE
ANGLE
BRACKETS
JESUS
IS
TALKING
WITH
THE
APOSTLES
AND
THEY
ASK
HIM
WHY
THE
PHARISEES
SAY
THAT
BEFORE
THE
MESSIAH
CAN
COME
ELIJAH
MUST
FIRST
COME
JESUS
REPLIES
THAT
ELIJAH
HAS
COME
BUT
THEY
DID
NOT
RECOGNIZE
HIM
IT
THEN
SAYS
THAT
THE
APOSTLES
PERCEIVED
THAT
HE
WAS
REFERI
NG
TO
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
THIS
SEEMS
TO
ME
TO
CLEARLY
IMPLY
REINCARNATION
THIS
WAS
A
POPULAR
BELIEF
IN
THE
JUDAISM
OF
JESUS
TIME
THAT
ELIJAH
WOULD
RETURN
AGAIN
AS
HE
HAD
BEEN
TAKEN
IN
TO
HEAVEN
IN
A
CHARIOT
AND
DID
NOT
ACTUALLY
DIE
HOWEVER
JESUS
WAS
REFERRING
TO
JOHN
THE
BAPTIST
NOT
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
ELIJAH
WAS
REINCARNATED
AS
JOHN
REMEMBER
ELIJAH
DIDNT
DIE
BUT
THAT
JOHN
WAS
A
SIMILAR
PROPHET
TO
ELIJAH
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
OF
SIMILARITY
IN
JESUS
INDICATION
ABOUT
JOHN
THE
PASSAGE
IN
MATTHEW
IS
VERY
DIRECT
WHERE
LUKE
REPORTS
THE
ANGEL
GABRIEL
PROPHESYING
THAT
JOHN
WILL
GO
BEFORE
CHRIST
IN
THE
POWER
AND
SPIRIT
OF
ELIAS
IN
MATTHEW
JESUS
HIMSELF
SAYS
OF
JOHN
AND
IF
YOU
CARE
TO
ACCEPT
IT
HE
HIMSELF
IS
ELIJAH
WHO
WAS
TO
COME
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THAT
JESUS
PREPENDED
THE
WORDS
IF
YOU
CARE
TO
ACCEPT
IT
AS
IF
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THIS
TRUTH
NAMELY
OF
REIN
CARNATION
I
WILL
NOT
FORCE
ON
YOU
BUT
FOR
THOSE
WHO
CAN
ACCEPT
IT
HERE
IT
IS
A
JEWISH
POSTER
TO
OTHER
NEWSGROUPS
ON
JEWISH
ESOTERICISM
AND
OTHER
TOPICS
HAS
OUTLINED
THE
ESOTERIC
CABBALISTIC
JEWISH
TEACHING
OF
OF
REINCARNATION
AND
KARMA
A
TEACHING
THAT
IS
LITTLE
KNOWN
AMONG
JEWS
TODAY
BUT
WHICH
IS
APPARENTLY
WIDESPREAD
ENOUGH
IN
ISRAEL
THAT
HANNAH
HURNARD
HINDS
FEET
ON
HIGH
PLACES
WAS
TOLD
ABOUT
IT
BY
A
RABBI
SHE
WAS
TRYING
TO
CONVERT
BACK
IN
THE
AS
A
MISSIONARY
IN
PALESTINE
THUS
THERE
MAY
WELL
HAVE
BEEN
A
SMALL
NUMBER
OF
JEWS
WHO
KNEW
ABOUT
THIS
WHEREAS
THE
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
DID
NOT
THE
STATEMENT
OF
JESUS
ABOUT
JOHN
THE
GREATEST
HUMAN
PERSONALITY
IN
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
IS
GUARDED
BUT
NEVERTHELESS
QUITE
DIRECT
AGAIN
THE
SUBJECT
OF
REINCARNATION
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
IS
NOT
A
SUBJECT
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
NOR
IS
THE
FATE
IN
GENERAL
OF
THE
HUMAN
BEING
BETWEEN
DEATH
AND
THE
LAST
JUDGEMENT
BUT
THERE
ARE
OCCASIONAL
INDICATIONS
THAT
POINT
TO
IT
AS
FOR
THE
POPULAR
BELIEF
THAT
ELIJAH
WOULD
COME
AGAIN
IT
WAS
MORE
THAN
A
POPULAR
BELIEF
AS
JESUS
CONFIRMS
IT
IN
MORE
THAN
ONE
PLACE
AND
HE
NEVER
CORRECTED
THOSE
WHO
WERE
EXPECTING
ELIJAH
FOR
EXAMPLE
THOSE
WHO
THOUGHT
THAT
JESUS
HIMSELF
BE
HE
GERRY
PALO
