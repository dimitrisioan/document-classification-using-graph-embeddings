C
S
LEWIS
IS
OK
WAS
ANCIENT
BOOKS
IN
ARTICLE
BILL
MAYNE
WROTE
THE
LAST
SENTENCE
IS
IRONIC
SINCE
SO
MANY
READERS
OF
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIAN
SEEM
TO
NOT
BE
EMBARRASSED
BY
APOLOGISTS
SUCH
AS
JOSH
MCDOWELL
AND
CS
LEWIS
THE
ABOVE
ALSO
EXPRESSES
A
RATHER
ODD
SENSE
OF
HISTORY
WHAT
MAKES
YOU
THINK
THE
MASSES
IN
AQUINAS
DAY
WHO
WERE
MOSTLY
ILLITERATE
KNEW
ANY
MORE
ABOUT
RHETORIC
AND
LOGIC
THAN
MOST
PEOPLE
TODAY
IF
WRITINGS
FROM
THE
PERIOD
SEEM
ELEVATED
CONSIDER
THAT
ONLY
THE
CREAM
OF
THE
CROP
SO
TO
SPEAK
COULD
READ
AND
WRITE
IF
EVERYONE
IN
THE
MEDIEVAL
PERIOD
KNEW
THE
RULES
IT
WAS
A
MATTER
OF
UNCRITICALLY
ACCEPTING
WHAT
THEY
WERE
TOLD
BILL
MAYNE
THIS
MAY
BE
UNFAIR
TO
LEWIS
THE
MOST
PROMINENT
FALLACY
ATTRIBUTED
TO
HIM
IS
THE
LIAR
LUNATIC
AND
LORD
AS
QUOTED
BY
MANY
CHRISTIANS
THIS
IS
A
LOGICAL
FALLACY
IN
ITS
ORIGINAL
CONTEXT
IT
WAS
NOT
CLH
EXACTLY
C
S
LEWIS
HAS
TAKEN
A
COUPLE
OF
PRETTY
SEVERE
HITS
IN
THIS
GROUP
LATELY
FIRST
SOMEBODY
WAS
ACCUSING
HIM
OF
BEING
SELFRIGHTEOUS
AND
UNCONVINCING
NOW
WE
ARE
TOLD
THAT
WE
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
BE
EMBARRASSED
BY
HIM
AS
WELL
AS
BY
JOSH
MCDOWELL
ABOUT
WHOM
I
HAVE
NO
COMMENT
HAVING
NEVER
READ
HIS
WORK
ANYONE
WHO
THINKS
THAT
C
S
LEWIS
WAS
SELFRIGHTEOUS
OUGHT
TO
READ
HIS
INTRODUCTION
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
PAIN
WHICH
IS
HIS
THEODICY
IN
IT
HE
EXPLAINS
THAT
HE
WANTED
TO
PUBLISH
THE
BOOK
ANONYMOUSLY
WHY
ALTHOUGH
HE
BELIEVED
IN
THE
ARGUMENT
HE
WAS
PRESENTING
HE
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
SEEM
TO
PRESUME
TO
TELL
OTHERS
HOW
BRAVE
THEY
SHOULD
BE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
THEIR
OWN
SUFFERING
HE
DID
NOT
WANT
PEOPLE
TO
THINK
THAT
HE
WAS
PRESENTING
HIMSELF
AS
SOME
KIND
OF
MODEL
OF
FORTITUDE
OR
THAT
HE
WAS
ANYTHING
OTHER
THAN
WHAT
HE
CONSIDERED
HIMSELF
TO
BE
A
GREAT
COWARD
OFM
HAS
ADEQUATELY
HANDLED
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
WE
OUGHT
TO
BE
EMBARRASSED
BY
LEWIS
LIARLUNATICLORD
ARGUMENT
WHICH
BY
THE
WAY
IS
PART
OF
A
MUCH
BIGGER
DISCOURSE
I
WOULD
JUST
LIKE
TO
ADD
THAT
FAR
FROM
BEING
EMBARRASSED
BY
LEWIS
I
AM
IN
A
STATE
OF
CONTINUAL
AMAZEMENT
AT
THE
SOUNDNESS
AND
CLARITY
OF
THE
ARGUMENTS
HE
PRESENTS
PHIL
HEY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
PHONE
COMPANY
HERE
THE
PHONE
COMPANY
DOESNT
HAVE
OPINIONS
ON
THIS
KIND
OF
STUFF
THIS
IS
ALL
ME
