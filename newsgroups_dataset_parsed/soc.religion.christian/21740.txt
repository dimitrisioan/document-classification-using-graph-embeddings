PETER
WHITE
WRITES
LUKE
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
RICH
MAN
AND
LAZARUS
MATTHEW
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
ETERNAL
FIRE
PREPARED
FOR
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
REVELATIONS
AND
REFERENCE
THIS
FIRE
AS
THE
PLACE
WHERE
UNBELIEVERS
ARE
THROWN
MATTHEW
TALKS
ABOUT
BEING
THROWN
INTO
THE
ETERNAL
FIRE
AND
THE
FIRE
OF
HELL
IT
SEEMS
QUITE
CLEAR
THAT
THERE
IS
THIS
PLACE
WHERE
A
FIRE
BURNS
FOREVER
FROM
THE
REVELATIONS
PASSAGES
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
WILL
BE
TORMENTED
THERE
FOREVER
FROM
THE
MATTHEW
PASSAGE
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
ABUNDANTLY
CLEAR
WHETHER
THE
PUNISHMENT
OF
UNBELIEVERS
IS
EVERLASTING
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
FINAL
OR
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
CONTINUAL
YOUVE
MISSED
ON
VERY
IMPORTANT
PASSAGE
THESS
FOR
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
ONLY
JUST
FOR
GOD
TO
REPAY
WITH
AFFLICTION
THOSE
WHO
AFFLICT
YOU
AND
TO
GIVE
RELIEF
TO
YOU
WHO
ARE
AFFLICTED
AND
TO
US
AS
WELL
WHEN
THE
LORD
JESUS
SHALL
BE
REVEALED
FROM
HEAVEN
WITH
HIS
MIGHTY
ANGELS
IN
FLAMING
FIRE
DEALING
OUT
RETRIBUTION
TO
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
KNOW
GOD
AND
TO
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
OBEY
THE
GOSPEL
OF
OUR
LORD
JESUS
AND
THESE
WILL
PAY
THE
PENALTY
OF
ETERNAL
DESTRUCTION
AWAY
FROM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
LORD
AND
FROM
THE
GLORY
OF
HIS
POWER
WHEN
HE
COMES
TO
BE
GLORIFIED
IN
HIS
SAINTS
ON
THAT
DAY
AND
TO
BE
MARVELED
AT
AMONG
ALL
WHO
HAVE
BELIEVED
FOR
OUR
TESTIMONY
TO
YOU
WAS
BELIEVED
THINGS
TO
NOTE
FROM
THIS
PASSAGE
UNBELIEVERS
ARE
BOTH
THOSE
WHO
OPENLY
REJECT
THE
GOSPEL
AND
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
KNOW
GOD
THE
ETERNAL
DESTRUCTION
IS
THE
SAME
AS
THE
ETERNAL
HOPE
IN
THIS
DISTRUCTIONS
PRIMARILY
EMPHASIZE
THAT
IT
IS
SEPARATION
FROM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
GOD
THE
CONTEXT
IS
SPEAKING
OF
THE
ADVENT
WHILE
IS
SPEAKING
OF
THE
RAPTURE
DONT
CONFUSE
THE
TWO
IN
THE
BIBLE
I
AM
NOT
AWARE
OF
ANY
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
THE
SPECIFICS
OF
HELL
BEYOND
THE
GENERAL
OF
HOT
UNPLEASANT
AND
TORMENT
YET
WE
HAVE
A
FAR
GREATER
DISCRIPTION
OF
HELL
THAT
WE
DO
HEAVEN
FOR
INSTANCE
IT
IS
NOT
DISCUSSED
HOW
IF
AT
ALL
THE
RICH
MAN
CAN
CONTINUALLY
STAY
IN
THE
FIRE
AND
STILL
FEEL
DISCOMFORT
OR
PAIN
OR
WHETHER
THERE
IS
SOME
POINT
AT
WHICH
THE
PAIN
SENSING
ABILITY
IS
BURNED
UP
IF
YOU
CAN
FORGIVE
THE
GRAPHICALNESS
IF
YOU
THROW
A
PHYSICAL
BODY
INTO
A
FIRE
ASSUMING
THE
PERSON
STARTS
OUT
ALIVE
AT
SOME
FAIRLY
QUICK
POINT
THE
NERVES
ARE
DESTROYED
AND
PAIN
IS
NO
LONGER
SENSED
IF
THIS
WAS
LIKE
EARTHLY
FIRE
THAT
REQUIRES
A
GAS
PRODUCING
SUBSTANCE
TO
IGNITE
HOWEVER
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
DIFFERENT
TYPE
OF
FIRE
AS
EXPRESSED
IN
THE
BURNING
BUSH
THAT
WAS
NOT
CONSUMED
ALSO
THE
DANIEL
ACCT
SHOWS
THAT
THE
LAWS
OF
NATURE
CAN
BE
INTERUPTED
EVEN
WITH
EARTHLY
FIRE
IT
IS
NOT
STATED
WHAT
OCCURS
WHEN
AT
THE
JUDGEMENT
THE
UNBELIEVERS
WHO
ARE
ALREADY
PHYSICALLY
DEAD
ARE
CAST
INTO
HELL
MAYBE
YOU
DONT
UNDERSTAND
THERE
WILL
BE
THOSE
WHO
ARE
ALIVE
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
MILLENIUM
WHO
WILL
WALK
STRAIGHT
INTO
THE
GWTJ
EVEN
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
DIED
IN
THEIR
SIN
WILL
BE
RESURRECTED
IE
REUNITED
WITH
THEIR
PHYSICAL
BODY
TO
RECEIVE
CONDEMNATION
IE
THEY
NO
LONGER
HAVE
A
PHYSICAL
BODY
SO
THEY
CANT
FEEL
PHYSICAL
PAIN
THIS
IS
CONTRARY
TO
THE
TEACHING
OF
SCRIPTURE
WHAT
COULD
BE
SENSED
CONTINUALLY
IS
THAT
THOSE
IN
HELL
ARE
TO
BE
FOREVER
WITHOUT
GOD
THE
LAZARUSRICH
MAN
PARABLE
IS
TOLD
WITH
THE
IDEA
OF
HAVING
THE
LISTENER
THINK
IN
PHYSICAL
TERMS
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
THE
POINT
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
WONT
LISTEN
TO
GOD
EVEN
AFTER
HE
RISES
FROM
THE
DEAD
THIS
IS
CONJECTURE
AT
BEST
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
IT
TO
SUPPORT
THE
NO
PHYSICAL
BODY
THESIS
THE
POINT
OF
THE
PARABLE
IS
TO
REACH
THE
HARDHEARTED
HERE
WHO
ARE
NOT
LISTENING
TO
THE
FACT
OF
THE
RESURRECTION
NOR
THE
GOSPEL
ABOUT
JESUS
CHRIST
IT
SEEMS
REASONABLE
TO
ALSO
DRAW
FROM
THE
PARABLE
THAT
HELL
IS
NOT
EVEN
REMOTELY
PLEASANT
THE
TRUE
AWLFULNESS
OF
HELL
IS
THAT
IT
IS
ETERNAL
SEPARATION
FROM
GOD
AFTER
HAVING
SEEN
THE
GLORY
OF
HIS
PRESENCE
AT
THE
GWTJ
BUT
WHETHER
IT
WAS
OPEN
REBELLION
AGAINST
THE
REVEALED
GOSPEL
OF
CHRIST
OR
IF
IT
IS
NOT
HAVING
KNOWN
GOD
NOT
SAUGHT
HIM
AS
HE
IS
THEN
AS
PAUL
SAYS
THEY
ARE
WITHOUT
EXCUSS
AND
THAT
EVERY
MOUTH
WILL
BE
STOPPED
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
DEFENSE
AT
THE
JUDGMENT
SEAT
OF
GOD
THEREFORE
WE
UNDERSTAND
IT
IS
APPOINTED
UNTO
MAN
ONCE
TO
DIE
AND
THEN
COMES
JUDGMENT
LITERALLY
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
IS
HORRIFIC
DOESNT
MAKE
IT
LESS
OF
A
REALITY
IT
SHOULD
COMPEL
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
HAVE
THE
RICHES
OF
CHRIST
TO
SHARE
IT
WITH
OTHERS
