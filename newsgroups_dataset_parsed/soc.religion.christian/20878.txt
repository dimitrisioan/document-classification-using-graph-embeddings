RE
CERTAINTY
AND
ARROGANCE
MY
LAST
ARTICLE
INCLUDED
THIS
QUOTE
IF
ANY
SUBSTANTIAL
NUMBER
OF
TALKRELIGIONMISC
READERS
READ
SOME
WITTGENSTEIN
OF
THE
POSTINGS
WOULD
DISAPPEAR
IF
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
SOME
WITTGENSTEIN
WOULD
DISAPPEAR
MICHAEL
L
SIEMON
SOMEONE
CALLED
BOUNDARY
WROTE
THIS
QUOTE
SEEMS
A
LITTLE
ARROGANT
DONT
YOU
THINK
THERE
IS
A
CONVENTION
CALLED
A
SMILEY
WHICH
LOOKS
LIKE
THIS
IT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
LOOK
LIKE
A
SIDEWAYS
SMILEYFACE
AND
INDICATES
THAT
THE
PRECEDING
COMMENT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
FUNNY
AND
ILL
NOTE
THAT
I
HAVE
PARTICIPATED
ON
TALKRELIGIONMISC
FOR
OVER
FIVE
YEARS
ID
SAY
MR
SIEMON
WAS
NOT
TOO
FAR
OFF
IN
THE
MEAT
OF
HIS
REPLY
MR
BOUNDARY
SERVES
UP
AN
EXCELLENT
EXAMPLE
OF
WHAT
I
MEANT
BY
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OUT
OF
THE
LOOP
I
WROTE
THAT
HUMAN
BRAINS
ARE
INFESTED
WITH
SIN
AND
CAN
BE
TRUSTED
ONLY
IN
LIMITED
CIRCUMSTANCES
IN
REPLY
MR
BOUNDARY
WROTE
I
WOULD
BEG
TO
DIFFER
WITH
YOU
HERE
THE
PROPERLYFORMED
CONSCIENCE
CAN
BE
TRUSTED
VIRTUALLY
ALL
THE
TIME
WHICH
JUST
MOVES
THE
PROBLEM
BACK
ONE
LEVEL
HOW
DO
YOU
TELL
IF
YOUR
CONSCIENCE
IS
PROPERLY
FORMED
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
TELL
IS
TO
PRESUPPOSE
THAT
YOU
ARE
CAPABLE
OF
JUDGING
THE
FORMEDNESS
OF
YOUR
OWN
CONSCIENCE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
YOU
CAN
ONLY
BE
SURE
THAT
YOUR
CONSCIENCE
IS
PROPERLY
FORMED
IF
YOU
ASSUME
THAT
YOUR
EVALUATION
CAN
BE
TRUSTED
ASSUMING
YOUR
CONCLUSIONS
SAVES
YOU
A
LOT
OF
TIME
ILL
GRANT
BUT
ITS
NOT
A
VALID
WAY
OF
REASONING
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
INFALLIBLE
YOUR
JUDGEMENTS
ABOUT
YOUR
OWN
THINKING
CANNOT
BE
CERTAIN
THEREFORE
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
CERTAIN
YOUR
CONSCIENCE
IS
PROPERLY
FORMED
WHATEVER
THAT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
MEAN
MR
BOUNDARY
THEN
GIVES
ANOTHER
PARADIGM
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
NOW
YOU
HAVE
HIT
ON
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
CHURCH
IT
IS
BY
NECESSITY
THE
INFALLIBLE
INTERPRETER
OF
DIVINE
REVELATION
WITHOUT
THE
CHURCH
CHRISTIANITY
WOULD
BE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
BUNCH
OF
LITTLE
DIVISIVE
SECTS
THE
CHURCH
IS
BY
NECESSITY
THE
INFALLIBLE
INTERPRETER
OF
DIVINE
REVELATION
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
PRESUMABLY
YOU
BELIEVE
THIS
BECAUSE
OF
SOME
ARGUMENT
OR
ANOTHER
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THE
ARGUMENT
CONTAINS
NO
MISTAKES
YOU
WRITE
THEREFORE
ALTHOUGH
OUR
MINDS
ARE
FINITE
AND
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ERROR
OUR
COMPETENCE
IN
ARRIVING
AT
INDUCTIVE
INSIGHTS
GIVES
CONFIDENCE
IN
OUR
ABILITY
TO
DISTINGUISH
WHAT
IS
TRUE
FROM
WHAT
IS
NOT
TRUE
EVEN
IN
AREAS
NOT
SUBJECT
TO
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
METHOD
BUT
THERE
IS
A
HUGE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CONFIDENCE
IN
OUR
ABILITY
TO
DISTINGUISH
WHAT
IS
TRUE
FROM
WHAT
IS
NOT
TRUE
AND
INFALLIBLE
I
AM
CONFIDENT
ABOUT
A
LOT
OF
THINGS
BUT
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
IS
A
VERY
LONG
WAY
FROM
CONFIDENT
THIS
DISCUSSION
IS
ABOUT
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CLAIMING
TO
BE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
REALLY
GO
CHECK
THE
SUBJECT
LINE
SAYING
YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT
THAN
SAYING
YOU
ARE
CONFIDENT
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
ARE
CONFIDENT
THAT
INVITES
PEOPLE
TO
ASK
WHY
EXCEPT
IN
VERY
LIMITED
CIRCUMSTANCES
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
CERTAIN
IT
INVITES
PEOPLE
TO
DISMISS
YOU
AS
SOMEONE
WHO
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ANY
IDEA
OF
HIS
OWN
FALLIBILITY
I
HAVE
YET
TO
MEET
ANYONE
WHO
BELIEVED
IN
A
KNOWABLYINFALLIBLE
SOURCE
OF
TRUTH
WHO
WOULD
ADMIT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ERRORS
IN
HIS
REASONING
ALL
OF
THEM
EVERY
LAST
ONE
HAS
CLAIMED
THAT
HE
WAS
HIMSELF
INFALLIBLE
THE
RESULT
HAS
BEEN
TO
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
THEY
HAD
NO
IDEA
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
DARREN
F
PROVINE
KILROYGBOROROWANEDU
THIS
PARTICULAR
DISCUSSION
MAY
NOT
BE
ENTIRELY
RELEVANT
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
CRITICISM
I
GET
THE
FEELING
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
REGARDED
AS
ARROGANT
THE
VERY
IDEA
THAT
THERE
ARE
RIGHT
AND
WRONG
ANSWERS
IN
RELIGION
AND
THAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
CAN
HAVE
ETERNAL
CONSEQUENCES
WHEN
I
SAY
THAT
I
THINK
THERE
IS
A
HELL
AND
THAT
HE
IS
AT
LEAST
IN
SIGNIFICANT
DANGER
OF
ENDING
UP
THERE
I
WILL
ADMIT
THAT
AS
YOU
SAY
THE
REASONING
PROCESSES
I
USED
TO
REACH
THIS
ARE
FALLIBLE
THUS
AT
LEAST
IN
PRINCIPLE
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
BUT
THESE
BASIC
FACTS
ARE
CLEARLY
ENOUGH
TAUGHT
IN
THE
BIBLE
THAT
I
THINK
ITS
UNLIKELY
THAT
IM
MISINTERPRETING
IT
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
THIS
LEVEL
OF
CONFIDENCE
IVE
TRIED
TO
FRAME
MY
STATEMENT
SUFFICIENTLY
CAREFULLY
AS
TO
SIDESTEP
A
NUMBER
OF
THE
MORE
CONTROVERSIAL
ISSUES
I
HAVENT
FOR
EXAMPLE
SAID
THAT
ALL
NONCHRISTIANS
WILL
DEFINITELY
END
UP
IN
HELL
AND
I
HAVENT
ATTEMPTED
TO
DESCRIBE
HELL
IN
ANY
DETAIL
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THAT
MY
VIEW
IS
GOING
TO
BE
REGARDED
AS
ARROGANT
AND
INTOLERANT
EVEN
THOUGH
I
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
IM
FALLIBLE
AND
SO
THERES
SOME
CHANCE
IM
WRONG
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
GENUINELY
ARROGANT
CHRISTIANS
AND
OFTEN
CRITICISM
OF
US
IS
JUSTIFIED
BUT
IN
AT
LEAST
SOME
CASES
I
THINK
THE
CRITICISMS
CONSTITUTE
BLAMING
THE
MESSENGER
IF
THE
UNIVERSE
IS
SET
UP
SO
THAT
THERE
ARE
ETERNAL
CONSEQUENCES
FOR
CERTAIN
DECISIONS
ITS
NOT
MY
FAULT
IM
JUST
TELLING
IT
THE
WAY
I
THINK
IT
IS
YOU
MAY
THINK
GOD
IS
IMMORAL
FOR
SETTING
THINGS
UP
THAT
WAY
ITS
ONE
OF
THE
CRITIQUES
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THAT
I
FIND
IT
MOST
DIFFICULT
TO
RESPOND
TO
BUT
ITS
NOT
ARROGANCE
FOR
ME
TO
TELL
WHAT
I
THINK
IS
THE
TRUTH
