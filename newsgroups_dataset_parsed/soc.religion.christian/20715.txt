RE
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
CHRISTIANS
DEAN
AND
I
WRITE
LOTS
AND
LOTS
ABOUT
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AND
ARROGANCE
VIRGILIO
DEAN
B
VELASCO
JR
WRITES
I
STRONGLY
SUSPECT
THAT
WE
ARE
REACHING
AN
IMPASSE
HERE
WHICH
IS
WHY
I
DEIGN
FROM
COMMENTING
MUCH
FURTHER
I
AGREE
THAT
WELL
PROBABLY
NEVER
AGREE
AND
IM
STARTING
TO
FEEL
FRUSTRATED
AND
IM
TIRED
OF
HAVING
MY
CONVERSATIONS
WITH
MY
HUSBAND
DOMINATED
BY
THIS
TOPIC
JUST
KIDDING
I
DO
HAVE
TO
SAY
THOUGH
THAT
PARTICIPATING
IN
THIS
DISCUSSION
HAS
BEEN
A
GOOD
LEARNING
EXPERIENCE
FOR
ME
MY
VIEWS
ON
THIS
TOPIC
HAVE
EVOLVED
AND
CLARIFIED
THROUGH
THIS
AND
I
SUSPECT
THAT
WE
MAY
NOT
DISAGREE
AS
MUCH
AS
WE
THINK
I
ADMIT
THAT
IM
STRONGLY
PREJUDICED
AGAINST
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANITY
AND
I
MAY
NOT
ALWAYS
BE
RATIONAL
IN
MY
REACTIONS
TO
IT
I
GREW
UP
IN
EC
AND
WENT
TO
AN
EC
COLLEGE
IT
WAS
DEFINITELY
THE
WRONG
PLACE
FOR
ME
AND
I
REACT
STRONGLY
TO
ANY
IMPLICATION
THAT
EC
OR
CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIANITY
HAS
ANY
SORT
OF
STRONGHOLD
ON
TRUE
CHRISTIANITY
I
SHUDDER
WHEN
I
REMEMBER
THE
CONDESCENDING
ATTITUDE
I
HAD
ABOUT
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
WHO
DIDNT
ADHERE
TO
THE
EC
MODEL
I
HAVE
COME
TO
SEE
THAT
MY
REAL
OBJECTION
TO
THIS
WHOLE
NOTION
OF
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
IS
THE
ACTIONS
I
HAVE
SEEN
IT
LEAD
TO
I
HAVE
HAD
SOME
VERY
BAD
EXPERIENCES
WITH
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS
CLAIMING
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
AND
JUDGING
ME
OR
OTHERS
BASED
ON
THEIR
BELIEF
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THE
ANSWERS
KNOWING
THE
TRUTH
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
LEAVE
A
WHOLE
LOT
OF
ROOM
FOR
OTHERS
OPINIONS
I
CAN
ACCEPT
YOUR
BELIEF
IN
ABSOLUTE
TRUTH
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
DONT
TRY
TO
USE
THAT
BELIEF
TO
TRY
TO
FORCE
OTHERS
TO
COMPLY
WITH
IT
AND
YOU
ARE
VERY
CAREFUL
THAT
YOU
DONT
HURT
OTHERS
WITH
IT
LOVE
YOUR
NEIGHBOR
SEEMS
TO
GO
TOTALLY
OUT
THE
WINDOW
WHEN
ONE
KNOWS
THE
TRUTH
AND
BELIEVES
THAT
EVERYONE
SHOULD
BE
LIVING
BY
THAT
TRUTH
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVE
CONVICTIONS
ABOUT
THE
TRUTH
EVERY
BIT
AS
STRONG
AND
SINCERE
AS
YOURS
BASED
ON
CAREFUL
SEARCHING
PRAYER
AND
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
GOD
DONT
DISMISS
THEM
BECAUSE
GOD
DIDNT
LEAD
THEM
TO
THE
SAME
CONCLUSIONS
AS
YOURS
THIS
IS
NOT
DIRECTED
PERSONALLY
AT
YOU
