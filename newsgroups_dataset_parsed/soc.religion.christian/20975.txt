re
being
right
about
messiahs
the
following
is
my
comment
on
an
article
by
desiree
bradley
clh
by
the
way
from
koreshs
public
statement
its
not
so
clear
to
me
that
he
is
claiming
to
be
christ
koresh
did
originally
claim
to
be
the
christ
but
then
backed
off
and
said
he
was
a
prophet
the
latest
news
at
cdt
from
waco
is
that
the
feds
broke
through
a
wall
of
the
compound
with
a
tank
no
news
besides
that
at
this
time
