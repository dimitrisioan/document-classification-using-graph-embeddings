WRITES

MAXWELL
C
MUIR

WRITES
OF
FAITH
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
KNOW
I
FEEL
THAT
FAITH
IS
INTELLECTUALLY
DISHONEST
ID
APPRECIATE
SOME
SUPPORT
FOR
THIS
STATEMENT
IM
NOT
SURE
IT
REALLY
MAKES
SENSE
TO
ME
I
DEFINE
FAITH
AS
BELIEF
IN
THE
ABSCENSESP
OF
EVIDENCE
I
ALSO
INCLUDE
IN
EVIDENCE
PAST
EXPERIENCES
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
NO
PAST
EXPERIENCE
IN
A
GOD
ACTUALLY
HAVING
AN
EFFECT
ON
MY
LIFE
AND
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
EVIDENCE
FOR
ANY
GOD
BEYOND
WHAT
CAN
BE
EXPLAINED
WITHOUT
THE
NECCESSITY
OF
A
GOD
OR
WHICH
IS
MORE
CONVINCING
THAN
THE
MANY
FICTIONAL
WORKS
I
HAVE
READ
AND
OTHER
REASONS
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
ANY
GODS
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
SOME
PEOPLE
RECONCILE
THIS
LACK
OF
EVIDENCE
BY
USING
FAITH
IT
IS
FAITH
IN
THAT
SENSE
THE
ONLY
WAY
I
CURRENTLY
UNDERSTAND
THE
WORD
FAITH
THAT
I
FIND
INTELLECTUALLY
DISHONEST
THE
AMBIGUITY
OF
RELIGIOUS
BELIEFS
AN
UNWILLINGNESS
TO
TAKE
PASCALS
WAGER
IVE
HEARD
THIS
FREQUENTLY
WHAT
EXACTLY
IS
PASCALS
WAGER
PASCALS
WAGER
GOES
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
PREMISE
EITHER
THERE
IS
OR
THERE
ISNT
A
GOD
PREMISE
IF
GOD
EXISTS
HE
WANTS
US
TO
BELIEVE
AND
WILL
DAMN
US
FOR
NOT
BELIEVING
PREMISE
IF
GOD
DOES
NOT
EXIST
THEN
BELIEF
IN
GOD
DOESNT
MATTER
BECAUSE
DEATH
IS
DEATH
ANYWAY
CONCLUSION
BELIEF
IN
GOD
IS
SUPERIOR
TO
NONBELIEF
BECAUSE
NONBELIEF
DAMNS
US
TO
ETERNAL
PUNISHMENT
IF
WE
ARE
WRONG
WHILE
BELIEF
IN
GOD
ONLY
WASTES
A
LITTLE
TIME
IN
LIFE
IF
WE
ARE
WRONG
SOUND
PRETTY
STRAIGHTFORWARD
AND
IS
LOGICALLY
SOUND
THE
PROBLEM
IS
PREMISE
PRESUPPOSES
ODDS
BETWEEN
BELIEF
AND
NONBELIEF
THIS
IS
FLAT
OUT
WRONG
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SHEER
NUMBER
OF
RELIGIONS
OUT
THERE
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THE
RELIGIONS
ARE
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
I
HAVE
HEARD
THEISTS
REFERRED
TO
AS
ATHEISTS
BECAUSE
THEY
BELIEVE
IN
THEIR
GOD
OR
GODS
TO
BE
THE
ONE
GOD
OR
SET
OF
GODS
THE
CONSEQUENCE
OF
THIS
IS
WHAT
IF
I
PICK
THE
WRONG
GOD
SUDDENLY
THE
ODDS
DONT
LOOK
SO
GOOD
BECAUSE
PICKING
THE
WRONG
GOD
OR
WRONG
DOCTRINES
OF
A
GOD
STILL
LEAVES
YOU
WITH
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
BEING
WRONG
AND
BEING
DAMNED
TO
ANOTHER
GODS
VERSION
OF
HELL
DO
I
SOUND
BROKEN
TO
YOU
I
DONT
KNOW
YOU
POINT
OUT
THAT
YOUR
MOTHERS
TREATMENT
UPSET
YOU
AND
SEE
INCONSISTENCIES
IN
VARIOUS
RELIGIONS
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THAT
CONSTITUTES
BROKENNESS
OR
NOT
IT
CERTAINLY
CONSITITUTES
DISILLUSIONMENT
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
DISILLUSIONMENT
ENTERS
INTO
IT
YOU
SEE
I
PRESENTED
MY
MOTHERS
TREATMENT
OF
ME
TO
SHOW
THE
CAUSE
OF
MY
QUESTIONING
MY
ATHEISM
A
QUESTIONING
WHICH
CONTINUES
TO
THIS
DAY
I
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
AN
ATHEIST
FOR
FIVE
YEARS
BEFORE
HAVING
ANY
CONTACT
WITH
MY
MOTHERS
VERSION
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IF
ANYTHING
I
HAD
BECOME
SOMEWHAT
DISILLUSIONED
WITH
ATHEISM
UH
OH
I
THOUGHT
WHAT
IF
THERE
IS
A
GOD
YES
IN
A
WAY
I
HAVE
ALSO
BECOME
DISILLUSIONED
BY
MANY
RELIGIONS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
I
HAD
THOUGHT
AT
ONE
TIME
THAT
THEY
HAD
ALL
THE
ANSWERS
IF
I
ONLY
FOUND
THE
RIGHT
ONE
IM
STILL
LOOKING
BUT
EACH
TIME
I
LOOK
IN
A
DIFFERENT
PLACE
I
BECOME
A
LITTLE
STRONGER
IN
MY
ATTITUDE
BELIEF
IF
YOU
WILL
NO
FAITH
THOUGH
ITS
BASED
ON
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
PAST
EXPERIENCE
THAT
ILL
NEVER
FIND
A
RELIGION
WHICH
HAS
ALL
THE
ANSWERS
SORTA
LIKE
LOOKING
FOR
EASTER
EGGS
THE
MORE
TIME
IT
TAKES
YOU
TO
FIND
THE
NEXT
ONE
THE
MORE
CONVINCED
YOU
BECOME
THAT
YOU
MAY
ALREADY
HAVE
FOUND
ALL
THE
EGGS
YOURE
GOING
TO
FIND
SOMEONE
ELSE
MENTIONED
THAT
CRITISISM
ISNT
GOING
TO
MAKE
ME
THINK
ANY
MORE
HIGHLY
OF
CHRISTIANS
I
HAVE
A
CONTRARY
POSITION
CONSTRUCTIVE
CRITISISM
WILL
LIKELY
IMPROVE
MY
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
CHRISTIANS
ABUSIVE
CRITISISM
WILL
TURN
ME
OFF
NO
ACCUSATIONS
TO
YOU
MR
SAPIENZA
I
MERELY
SLIPPED
THAT
INTO
