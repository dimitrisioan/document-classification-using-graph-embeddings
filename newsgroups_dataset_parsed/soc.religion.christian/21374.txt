WHY
ARE
ATHEISTS
ATHEISTS
BELIEVES
IT
COULD
BE
THE
RESULT
OF
BROKENNESS
THIS
IS
CONDESCENDING
AT
BEST
AND
A
SLIGHTLY
DISQUISED
AD
HOMINEM
ATTACK
THIS
ATTITUDE
ON
THE
PART
OF
MANY
THEISTS
ESPECIALLY
THE
VOCAL
ONES
IS
ONE
REASON
FOR
THE
HOSTILITY
YOU
SENSE
HOW
DO
YOU
LIKE
IT
WHEN
ATHEISTS
SAY
THAT
PEOPLE
TURN
TO
RELIGION
OUT
OF
IMMATURE
EMOTIONALISM
I
AGREE
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
FIND
OUT
ANYTHING
FROM
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
SHARE
YOUR
BELIEFS
DO
NOT
ATTACK
THEM
OR
CONDESCEND
TO
THEM
AND
HOPE
TO
GET
A
NEUTRAL
PICTURE
OF
THEM
COME
TO
THEM
WITH
AN
OPEN
MIND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
ATHEISTS
ARE
GENERALLY
ANY
MORE
BROKEN
THAN
ANYBODY
ELSE
ANY
CAUSE
AND
EFFECT
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
THE
OTHER
WAY
THERE
IS
AN
EMOTIONAL
PRICE
TO
PAY
FOR
BEING
DIFFERENT
HEARING
ONES
BELIEFS
OR
LACK
THEREOF
CONDEMNED
AND
ONES
MOTIVES
AND
CHARACTER
ATTACKED
WELL
YOU
DO
BELIEVE
IN
SOMETHING
AS
I
SEE
IT
EVEN
IF
IT
IS
A
SORT
OF
ANTIBELIEF
NO
NEGATIVE
CONNOTATION
MEANT
I
MEAN
SIMPLY
THAT
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
GOD
DOES
NOT
EXIST
CHRISTIANS
CAN
ALSO
FEEL
THAT
SENSE
OF
DIFFERENCE
HOWEVER
WHEN
THEY
ARE
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THOSE
WEIRD
TELEVANGELISTS
WHO
ALWAYS
TALK
ABOUT
SATAN
IF
YOULL
EXCUSE
THE
CLICHED
SOUND
OF
THIS
EVERYONE
HAS
TO
DEAL
WITH
HIS
HER
DIFFERENCES
FROM
OTHER
PEOPLE
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
HOW
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
COULD
BE
HARD
FOR
YOU
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
IS
SOMETIMES
HARD
FOR
ME
I
BECAME
AN
ATHEIST
WHEN
I
GOT
OLD
ENOUGH
TO
REASON
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
JUST
NO
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THE
RELIGION
I
HAD
BEEN
TAUGHT
THIS
WAS
VERY
PAINFUL
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PRESSURE
I
WAS
PLACED
UNDER
BY
MY
FAMILY
AND
FRIENDS
I
WANTED
TO
FIT
IN
BELIEVE
AND
BE
ACCEPTED
I
TRIED
BUT
FINALLY
THE
COGNITIVE
DISSONANCE
WAS
JUST
TOO
GREAT
YOU
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
REPRESS
HOW
YOU
FEEL
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
DISCUSS
IT
WITHOUT
FEAR
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
ADMIRABLE
THINGS
TO
LEARN
FROM
ANY
BELIEF
WHICH
CAN
ENRICH
YOUR
OWN
BY
ASKING
MYSELF
THE
QUESTIONS
THAT
ATHEISTS
MAY
ASK
ME
I
CAN
LEARN
THE
ANSWERS
AND
BECOME
STRONGER
IN
MY
FAITH
IF
MY
FAITH
CANT
SUPPORT
KNOWING
THE
ANSWERS
TO
THOSE
QUESTIONS
IT
IS
WEAK
AND
UNTRUE
I
HAVE
SYMPATHY
FOR
GAYS
GROWING
UP
IN
REPRESSIVE
ENVIRONMENTS
AND
HAVING
TO
HIDE
AND
SOMETIMES
AT
FIRST
TRY
TO
DENY
A
PART
OF
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
IVE
BEEN
THERE
ONLY
IN
MY
CASE
IT
WAS
MY
RATIONALITY
INSTEAD
OF
SEXUALITY
WHICH
I
WAS
FORCED
TO
TRY
TO
REPRESS
IN
SOME
WAY
THE
PRESSURES
WERE
DIFFERENT
OF
COURSE
BECAUSE
YOU
CHOSE
YOUR
BELIEFS
OR
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
YOUR
CHOICE
BUT
BORN
OF
NECESSITY
PLEASE
NO
FLAMES
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
GAY
PEOPLE
CHOOSE
THEIR
LIFESTYLE
THATS
ELSEWHERE
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
I
MUST
SAY
THAT
I
WASNT
HURT
BY
MY
EXPERIENCES
IN
CHURCH
ANY
MORE
THAN
SOME
OF
MY
FRIENDS
WHO
DIDNT
BECOME
ATHEISTS
I
WAS
JUST
HURT
DIFFERENTLY
IM
NOT
SURE
I
UNDERSTAND
THIS
SENTENCE
COULD
YOU
EXPLAIN
MODERATOR
POINTS
OUT
THAT
MANY
MOST
ATHEISTS
ARENT
HOSTILE
THEY
JUST
CEASE
BELIEVIING
IN
XIANTIY
RELIGION
TRUE
CONSIDER
ALSO
THAT
PEOPLE
LIKE
PAT
ROBERTSON
AND
MANY
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
EXTREMISTS
IN
SOCRELIGIONCHRISTIANITY
NATURALLY
EVOKE
HOSTILITY
BY
THEIR
ATTACKS
ON
ANYONE
WHO
DISAGREES
AND
THEIR
ATTEMPTS
TO
FORCE
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
OTHERS
YOU
ARE
KNOWN
BY
THE
COMPANY
YOU
KEEP
CHRISTIANS
TRYING
TO
PREACH
IN
ALTATHEISM
SHOULD
NOT
BE
SURPRISED
BY
HOSTILITY
OUCH
YES
PART
OF
BEING
A
CHRISTIAN
IS
ACCEPTING
EVERYONE
WITH
AN
OPEN
HEART
INCLUDING
PEOPLE
OF
OUR
OWN
CAMP
WITH
WHOM
WE
COMPLETELY
DISAGREE
BY
THE
SAME
TOKEN
I
BELIEVE
THAT
ACCUSATION
AND
SUSPICION
ARE
NOT
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
REACH
OUT
TO
THOSE
NOT
OF
OUR
FAITH
NOR
IS
IT
EFFECTIVE
TO
TRY
TO
BROWBEAT
PEOPLE
INTO
ACCEPTING
OUR
RELIGION
I
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
IDEA
OF
MISSION
BE
WHAT
I
AM
A
CHRISTIAN
WHO
IS
HAPPY
IN
HER
FAITH
AND
IF
OTHERS
SEE
THAT
AND
WANT
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
EITHER
THE
HAPPINESS
OR
THE
RELIGION
ILL
SHARE
WHAT
I
KNOW
WITHOUT
PRESSURE
AND
LET
THEM
MAKE
THEIR
OWN
DECISIONS
AT
SOME
POINT
YOU
JUST
HAVE
