the
basic
problem
with
your
argument
is
your
total
and
complete
reliance
on
the
biblical
text
lukes
account
is
highly
suspect
i
would
refer
you
to
the
hermeneia
commentary
on
acts
moreover
lukes
account
is
written
at
least
years
after
the
fact
in
the
meantime
everyone
he
mentions
has
died
and
attempts
to
find
actual
written
sources
behind
the
text
have
come
up
with
only
the
we
section
of
the
later
portion
of
acts
as
firmly
established
moreover
pauls
account
of
some
of
the
events
in
acts
as
recorded
in
galatians
fail
to
establish
the
acts
accounts
even
if
there
was
no
independent
proof
that
lukes
account
was
valid
i
find
it
strange
that
you
would
take
the
negation
of
it
as
truth
without
any
direct
historical
evidence
at
least
that
youve
mentioned
to
back
it
up
the
assertion
was
made
unequivocally
that
no
christian
ever
sufferred
for
their
faith
by
believing
in
the
resurrection
lukes
account
suggests
otherwise
and
in
the
absence
of
direct
eyewitnesses
who
can
claim
that
luke
is
mistaken
then
i
suggest
that
this
unequivocal
assertion
is
suspect

i
think
the
original
claim
may
have
been
somewhat
more
limited
than
this
it
was
an
answer
to
the
claim
that
the
witnesses
couldnt
be
lying
because
they
were
willign
to
suffer
for
their
beliefs
thus
its
not
necessary
to
show
that
no
christian
ever
suffered
for
believing
in
the
resurrection
rather
the
issue
is
whether
those
who
witnessed
it
did
i
do
agree
that
the
posting
youre
responding
to
shows
that
there
can
be
liberal
as
well
as
conservative
dogmatism
