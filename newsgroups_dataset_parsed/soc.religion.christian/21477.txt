JAY

WRITES
MATERIAL
DELETED
SOME
OBJECT
TO
THE
IDEA
THAT
CHRISTIANITY
SHOULD
INVOLVE
SECRETS
OF
ANY
KIND
MORMON
SCHOLARS
HAVE
PROVIDED
HISTORICAL
EVIDENCE
OF
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
PRACTICES
WHICH
PARALLEL
MORMON
TEMPLE
CEREMONIES
OBVIOUSLY
ONE
CAN
CHOOSE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
TO
SUBSCRIBE
TO
SUCH
A
HISTORICAL
INTERPRETATION
BUT
MORMON
PRACTICE
IS
NOT
WITHOUT
PRECEDENT
IN
CHRISTIANITY
DELETIONS
I
DONT
NECESSARILY
OBJECT
TO
THE
SECRECY
BUT
I
DO
QUESTION
IT
SINCE
I
SEE
NO
BIBLICAL
REASON
WHY
ANY
ASPECT
OF
CHRISTIAN
WORSHIP
SHOULD
INVOLVE
SECRECY
BUT
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
YOUR
CLAIM
THAT
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
PRACTICES
PARALLEL
MORMON
TEMPLE
CEREMONIES
COULD
YOU
GIVE
AN
EXAMPLE
ALSO
WHY
DO
THEY
ONLY
PARALLEL
MORMON
CEREMONIES
WHY
DONT
MORMON
CEREMONIES
RESTORE
THE
ORIGINAL
CHRISTIAN
PRACTICES
WASNT
THAT
