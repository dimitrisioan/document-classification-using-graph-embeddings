ST
ALOYSIUS
GONZAGA
HERES
A
STORY
OF
A
SAINT
THAT
PEOPLE
MIGHT
LIKE
TO
READ
I
GOT
IT
FROM
A
THE
MORNING
STAR
AND
AM
POSTING
IT
WITH
THE
PERMISSION
OF
THE
EDITOR
SAINT
ALOYSIUS
GONZAGA
THE
PATRON
OF
YOUTH
THE
MARQUIS
GONZAGA
HAD
HIGH
ASPIRATIONS
FOR
HIS
SON
THE
PRINCE
GONZAGE
HE
WANTED
HIM
TO
BECOME
A
FAMOUS
BRAVE
AND
HONOURED
SOLDIER
AFTER
ALL
HE
MUST
CARRY
ON
THE
GREAT
FAMILY
NAME
OF
GONZAGA
OF
COURSE
HE
WAS
TO
BECOME
FAR
MORE
FAMOUS
BRAVE
AND
HONOURED
THAN
HIS
FATHER
COULD
EVER
HAVE
IMAGINED
THOUGH
NOT
IN
THE
MANNER
EXPECTED
SAINT
ALOYSIUS
MOTHER
WAS
A
WOMAN
WHO
RECEIVED
IMMENSE
JOY
FROM
PRAYING
TO
GOD
AND
MEDITATING
ON
THE
DIVINE
MYSTERIES
AND
THE
LIFE
OF
OUR
LORD
SHE
HAD
LITTLE
TIME
FOR
THE
PLEASURES
OF
THIS
LIFE
AS
SAINT
ALOYSIUS
GREW
HE
BEGAN
TO
RESEMBLE
HIS
MOTHER
MORE
THAN
HIS
FATHER
SAINT
ALOYSIUS
HAD
LEARNED
NUMEROUS
EXPRESSIONS
FROM
HIS
FATHERS
SOLDIERS
BUT
THE
MOMENT
HE
DISCOVERED
THAT
THEY
WERE
VULGAR
HE
FAINTED
FROM
SHOCK
THIS
SHOWS
HIS
IMMENSE
HATRED
OF
SIN
WHAT
AN
EXAMPLE
FOR
US
OF
THE
CONTEMPT
WE
MUST
HAVE
FOR
SIN
ABOUT
THE
TIME
OF
HIS
FIRST
HOLY
COMMUNION
WHICH
HE
RECEIVED
FROM
THE
ARCHBISHOP
OF
MILAN
CHARLES
BORROMEO
WHOM
HIMSELF
BECAME
A
GREAT
SAINT
HE
CONSECRATED
HIS
PURITY
TO
GOD
AND
ASKED
THE
BLESSED
VIRGIN
TO
PROTECT
HIS
INNOCENCE
FOR
LIFE
HE
WANTED
TO
SHARE
OUR
LORDS
SUFFERING
TO
SHOW
HIS
RECIPROCAL
LOVE
HE
STARTED
BY
DENYING
HIS
PASSIONS
HE
AVOIDED
EATING
THE
FINEST
FOODS
WEARING
THE
BEST
CLOTHES
AND
WOULD
PUT
PIECES
OF
WOOD
IN
HIS
BED
IN
ORDER
TO
MORTIFY
HIMSELF
FOR
THE
LOVE
OF
GOD
WHILE
HE
WAS
IN
HIS
EARLY
TEENS
HIS
FATHER
SENT
HIM
AND
HIS
YOUNGER
BROTHER
TO
THE
COURT
OF
THE
SPANISH
KING
PHILLIP
OBEDIENTLY
HE
SET
OUT
TO
MAKE
THE
BEST
OF
IT
HE
MIXED
IN
WELL
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
ROYAL
COURT
FOR
HE
WAS
HANDSOME
POLITE
INTELLIGENT
AND
ALWAYS
HAD
SOMETHING
INTERESTING
TO
SAY
NOT
LONG
BEFORE
THIS
TIME
THE
GREAT
SOLDIERSAINT
SAINT
IGNA
TIUS
OF
LOYOLA
HAD
FOUNDED
THE
SOCIETY
OF
JESUS
THE
JESUITS
TOWARDS
WHICH
SAINT
ALOYSIUS
BEGAN
TO
HAVE
A
YEARNING
WHEN
HE
FINALLY
TOLD
HIS
FATHER
THE
MARQUIS
FLEW
INTO
A
RAGE
AND
FORBADE
HIS
SON
TO
BECOME
A
PRIEST
AFTER
A
SHORT
TIME
HIS
FATHER
SENT
HIM
TO
THE
GREAT
CITIES
IN
ORDER
THAT
HE
BE
TEMPTED
AWAY
FROM
THE
PRIESTHOOD
BUT
EVEN
THROUGH
THESE
TRIALS
SAINT
ALOYSIUS
GREW
IN
HIS
DESIRE
FOR
THE
RELIGIOUS
LIFE
AND
WAS
STRENGTHENED
IN
THE
VIRTUE
OF
PURITY
THE
MARQUIS
PLANS
WERE
OBVIOUSLY
FAILING
SO
HE
CONFRONTED
HIS
SON
WILL
YOU
OR
WILL
YOU
NOT
OBEY
ME
AND
FORGET
THIS
FOOLISH
NESS
I
WILL
NOT
FATHER
WAS
THE
INEVITABLE
REPLY
THEN
LEAVE
FROM
MY
SIGHT
AND
DONT
RETURN
UNTIL
YOU
CHANGE
YOUR
MIND
WITH
TEARS
CLOUDING
HIS
EYES
THE
SAINT
LEFT
THE
ROOM
TO
PRAY
TELL
ME
LORD
WHAT
AM
I
TO
DO
TELL
ME
TELL
ME
HE
KNELT
DOWN
TO
FLAGELLATE
HIMSELF
AS
HE
HAD
DONE
SEVERAL
TIMES
BEFORE
BUT
THIS
TIME
HE
WAS
SEEN
THE
ONLOOKER
RUSHED
TO
THE
MARQUIS
THIS
AT
LAST
BROUGHT
THE
PROUD
MAN
TO
HIS
SENSES
THE
LORD
WANTS
HIM
THE
LORD
CAN
HAVE
HIM
HE
GAVE
HIS
CONSENT
FOR
HIS
SON
TO
BECOME
A
JESUIT
AFTER
SOME
YEARS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SIXTEENTH
CENTURY
A
TERRI
BLE
EPIDEMIC
BROKE

IN
ROME
ALL
THE

THEIR
OWN
SAINT
ALOY
SIUS
DID
ALL
HE
COULD
IN
THE
HOSPITALS
PARTICULARLY
TO
PREPARE
THE
DYING
FOR
A
HOLY

SAINT

CONTRACTED
THE
PLAGUE
FROM
CARRYING
AND
NURSING
THE

THREE
MONTHS

LAY
WITH
A
BURNING
FEVER
AND
