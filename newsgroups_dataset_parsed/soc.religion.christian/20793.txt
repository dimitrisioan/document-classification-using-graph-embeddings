RE
CHRISTIANS
THAT
ARE
NOT
CHURCH
MEMBERS
HERE
ARE
SOME
NOTES
ABOUT
WHAT
THE
CHURCH
IS
TO
BE
LIKE
AND
SOME
HELPFUL
IDEAS
ABOUT
HOW
TO
CHOOSE
A
CHURCH
COLOSSIANS
A
JESUS
IS
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
BODY
THE
CHURCH
B
YOU
CANNOT
SAY
YES
TO
JESUS
BUT
NO
TO
THE
CHURCH
EPHESIANS
A
THE
CHURCH
IS
THE
FAMILY
OF
GOD
B
THE
CHURCH
IS
BASED
ON
THE
WORD
OF
GOD
ONLY

SEE
REVELATION
CORINTHIANS
A
BAPTISM
IS
WHEN
WE
BECOME
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
CHURCH
AS
FOR
THE
QUESTION
OF
DENOMINATIONS
A
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
ONE
CHURCH
FROM
EPHESIANS
ROMANS
CORINTHIANS
B
CORINTHIANS
SAYS
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NO
DIVISIONS
IN
THE
CHURCH
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NO
FOLLOWING
OF
PERSONALITIES
IN
THE
CHURCH
AND
IN
TIME
THEIR
WRITINGS
C
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
CHURCHES
TODAY
BECAUSE
OF
A
PROBLEM
TIMOTHY
SAYS
THAT
PEOPLE
WILL
TURN
AWAY
FROM
THE
TRUTH
AND
TRY
TO
FIND
A
CHURCH
THAT
TEACHES
A
DOCTRINE
THAT
SUITS
THEIR
LIFESTYLE
HEBREWS
A
DO
NOT
MISS
CHURCH
B
PURPOSE
IS
TO
ENCOURAGE
EACH
OTHER
SO
WE
WILL
REMAIN
FAITHFUL
INVOLVED
ON
A
RELATIONSHIP
LEVEL
IN
THE
CHURCH
C
MUST
COME
TO
ALL
SERVICES
ANOTHER
VERSE
WHICH
IS
HELPFUL
IS
HEBREWS
THE
CHURCH
SHOULD
BE
ENCOURAGING
DAILY
AS
IT
IS
THEIR
DUTY
TO
DO
OF
COURSE
MORE
STANDARDS
APPLY
TIMOTHY
PEOPLE
IN
THE
CHURCH
SHOULD
BE
WATCHING
THEIR
LIVES
AND
DOCTRINES
TO
MAKE
SURE
THEY
BOTH
LIVE
UP
TO
THE
WORD
ENTIRELY
IE
DISCIPLES
ACTS
THE
PASTOR
DOES
NOT
COME
CLOSE
TO
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
NATURAL
CONCLUSION
SINCE
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
TALKED
WITH
JESUS
DIRECTLY
FACE
TO
FACE
SO
IF
THE
BEREANS
WHO
WERE
CONSIDERED
NOBLE
DIDNT
TAKE
PAUL
AT
HIS
WORD
BUT
CHECKED
OUT
WHAT
HE
SAID
WITH
SCRIPTURE
TO
VERIFY
HIS
STATEMENTS
THEN
CHURCH
MEMBERS
ARE
TO
DO
THE
SAME
AND
VERIFY
THE
PASTORS
STATEMENTS
IF
THEY
ARE
NOT
VERIFIABLE
OR
VALID
IN
LIGHT
OF
OTHER
VERSES
THEN
THAT
GROUP
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
AS
A
CHURCH
WOULDVE
MADE
A
WONDERFUL
SUGGESTION
TO
THE
WACO
GROUP
ESPECIALLY
IN
LIGHT
OF
MATTHEW
