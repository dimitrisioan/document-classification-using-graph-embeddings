WRITES
INSERT
DELETION
OF
UNNECESSARY
QUOTE
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
WE
HAVE
THIS
NOTION
THAT
GOD
TAKES
SOME
SORT
OF
PLEASURE
FROM
PUNISHING
PEOPLE
THE
PURPOSE
OF
HELL
IS
TO
DESTROY
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
FIRST
OF
ALL
GOD
DOES
NOT
TAKE
ANY
SORT
OF
PLEASURE
FROM
PUNISHING
PEOPLE
HE
WILL
HAVE
MERCY
ON
WHOM
HE
WILL
HAVE
MERCY
AND
COMPASSION
ON
WHOM
HE
WILL
HAVE
COMPASSION
EX
HOWEVER
IF
HE
ENJOYED
PUNISHING
PEOPLE
AND
SENDING
THEM
TO
HELL
THEN
WHY
WOULD
HE
SEND
JESUS
TO
SEEK
AND
SAVE
THAT
WHICH
WAS
LOST
LUKE
TO
THE
EARLIER
POSTER
WHO
TRIED
TO
SUPPORT
THE
ETERNAL
HELL
THEORY
WITH
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
FALLEN
ANGELS
WERE
NOT
DESTROYED
REMEMBER
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THAT
GOD
HAS
RESERVED
THEM
UNTIL
THE
DAY
OF
JUDGEMENT
THEIR
JUDGEMENT
IS
SOON
TO
COME
LET
ME
SUGGEST
THIS
MAYBE
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
ETERNAL
HELL
THEORY
SHOULD
PROVIDE
ALL
THE
BIBLICAL
EVIDENCE
THEY
CAN
FIND
FOR
IT
STAY
AWAY
FROM
HUMAN
THEORIES
AND
ONLY
TAKE
INTO
ACCOUNT
REFERENCES
IN
THE
BIBLE
YOU
ASKED
FOR
IT
PETER
TALKS
ABOUT
HOW
THOSE
WHO
ARE
UNGODLY
ARE
PUNISHED
MATTHEW
IS
ALSO
VERY
CLEAR
THAT
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
RIGHTEOUS
IN
GODS
EYES
WILL
BE
SENT
TO
HELL
FOR
ETERNITY
THESSALONIANS
STATES
THAT
THOSE
WHO
CAUSE
TROUBLE
FOR
THE
DISCIPLES
WILL
BE
PUNISHED
WITH
EVERLASTING
DESTRUCTION
AND
SHUT
OUT
FROM
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
LORD
THESSALONIANS
TALKS
ABOUT
THOSE
WHO
REFUSE
TO
LOVE
THE
TRUTH
BEING
CONDEMNED
REVELATION
TALKS
ABOUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THOSE
WHO
OVERCOMES
AND
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
LISTED
IN
VERSE
WILL
BE
IN
THE
FIERY
LAKE
OF
BURNING
SULFUR
REVELATION
GIVES
THE
INDICATION
THAT
THOSE
WHO
FOLLOW
THE
BEAST
WILL
BE
TORMENTED
WITH
BURNING
SULFUR
AND
THERE
BEING
NO
REST
DAY
OR
NIGHT
FOR
THEM
BECAUSE
OF
IT
PSALM
THE
WICKED
RETURN
TO
THE
GRAVE
ALL
THE
NATIONS
THAT
FORGET
GOD
I
THINK
THOSE
SHOULD
BE
SUFFICIENT
TO
PROVE
THE
POINT
DARIUS
JOE
FISHER
IN
THE
FOLLOWING
IM
MOSTLY
PLAYING
DEVILS
ADVOCATE
IM
NOT
ADVOCATING
EITHER
POSITION
MY
CONCERN
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND
THAT
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
SEE
THESE
PASSAGES
IN
DIFFERENT
WAYS
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
SEE
ETERNAL
DESTRUCTION
AS
JUST
THAT
DESTRUCTION
REV
OFTEN
USES
THE
TERM
SECOND
DEATH
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THAT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
FINAL
EXTINCTION
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
NT
SPEAKS
BOTH
OF
ETERNAL
PUNISHMENT
AND
OF
SECOND
DEATH
IE
IT
USES
TERMS
THAT
CAN
BE
UNDERSTOOD
EITHER
WAY
MY
CONCERN
HERE
IS
NOT
TO
CONVINCE
YOU
OF
ONE
VIEW
OR
THE
OTHER
BUT
TO
HELP
PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THERES
A
WIDE
ENOUGH
VARIETY
OF
IMAGES
THAT
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
UNDERSTAND
THEM
EITHER
WAY
AS
TOM
ALBRECHT
COMMENTED
THE
PRIMARY
POINT
IS
TO
DO
OUR
BEST
TO
KEEP
PEOPLE
OUT
OF
THE
ETERNAL
FIRE
WHATEVER
THE
DETAILS
TO
MAKE
THINGS
MORE
INTERESTING
LUKE
IMPLIES
THAT
THE
DAMNED
DONT
GET
RESURRECTED
AT
ALL
PRESUMABLY
THEY
JUST
STAY
DEAD
YES
IM
AWARE
THAT
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
UNDERSTAND
THIS
PASSAGE
IN
A
NONLITERAL
WAY
PETER
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
ANGELS
AND
TALKS
ABOUT
HOLDING
THEM
IN
HELL
UNTIL
THE
FINAL
JUDGEMENT
THIS
ISNT
ETERNAL
PUNISHEMENT
MATTHEW
TALKS
ABOUT
SENDING
THE
CURSED
INTO
ETERNAL
FIRE
PREPARED
FOR
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
FIRE
IS
ETERNAL
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
PEOPLE
WILL
LAST
IN
ITS
FLAMES
FOREVER
PARTICULARLY
INTERESTING
IS
THE
COMMENT
ABOUT
THE
FIRE
HAVING
BEEN
PREPARED
FOR
THE
DEVIL
AND
HIS
ANGELS
REV
AND
TALK
ABOUT
THE
ETERNAL
FIRE
AS
WELL
THEY
SAY
THAT
THE
BEAST
AND
THE
FALSE
PROPHET
WILL
BE
TORMENTED
FOREVER
IN
IT
WHEN
TALKING
ABOUT
PEOPLE
BEING
THROWN
INTO
IT
IT
IS
REFERRED
TO
AS
THE
SECOND
DEATH
THIS
SOUNDS
MORE
LIKE
EXTINCTION
THAN
ETERNAL
TORMENT
IS
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
FIRE
HAS
DIFFERENT
EFFECTS
ON
SUPERNATURAL
ENTITIES
SUCH
AS
THE
DEVIL
AND
HUMANS
THESSALONIANS
SIMILARLY
WHAT
IS
EVERLASTING
DESTRUCTION
THIS
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
ETERNAL
TORMENT
THIS
ONE
CAN
CLEARLY
BE
UNDERSTOOD
EITHER
WAY
BUT
I
THINK
ITS
AT
LEAST
POSSIBLE
TO
THINK
THAT
EVERLASTING
IS
BEING
USED
TO
CONTRAST
THE
KIND
OF
DESTRUCTION
THAT
CAN
OCCUR
IN
THIS
LIFE
WITH
THE
FINAL
DESTRUCTION
THAT
OCCURS
IN
ETERNITY
THESSALONIANS
AGAIN
TALKS
ABOUT
DESTRUCTION
REVELATION
SEE
COMMENT
ABOVE
REVELATION
IS
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
OF
THE
QUOTES
EVEN
THERE
IT
DOESNT
EXPLICITLY
SAY
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
SUFFER
FOREVER
IT
SAYS
THAT
THE
SMOKE
AND
PRESUMABLY
THE
FIRE
IS
ETERNAL
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
RESPITE
FROM
IT
BUT
IT
DOESNT
SAY
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
TORMENTED
FOREVER
PSALM
I
DONT
SEE
THAT
IT
SAYS
ANYTHING
RELEVANT
TO
THIS
ISSUE
