WEIRDNESS
OF
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
I
AM
A
GOOD
CATHOLIC
BOY
A
CONVERT
NO
LESS
ATTRACTED
BY
THE
RATIONAL
TRADITION
AQUINAS
ET
AL
AND
THE
EMOTIONAL
AUTHENTICITY
IN
COMP
WITH
THE
FADDISHNESS
OF
ANGLICANISM
TO
ROMAN
CATHOLICISM
I
NEVER
HAD
MUCH
TIME
FOR
THE
POPE
OR
ANY
OTHER
HEIRARCHS
BUT
I
DID
AND
DO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
SACREMENTAL
SYSTEM
I
ALWAYS
FELT
QUITE
HAPPY
TO
LOOK
DOWN
MY
NOSE
AT
THOSE
SUCH
AS
JOHN
EMERY
A
FEW
POSTS
BACK
WHO
HAD
TO
ENGAGE
IN
CIRCUITOUS
TEXTUAL
ARGUMENTS
TO
PROVE
THEIR
FAITH
ENTIRELY
OBLIVIOUS
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
A
DOZEN
OTHER
FAITHS
CAN
DO
THE
SAME
WITH
MIRACLES
TOO
AND
THAT
SINCE
THEIR
ARGUMENTS
DEPEND
ON
THE
BELIEF
IN
THE
BIBLE
AS
GODS
SOLE
REVELATION
IT
WAS
NOT
VERY
GOOD
LOGIC
TO
ARGUE
THAT
THE
BIBLE
PROVED
GOD
NO
I
WAS
HAPPY
TO
ACCEPT
THE
CHURCH
AS
GODS
REVELATION
IT
WAS
THE
CHURCH
AFTER
ALL
THAT
EXISTED
BEFORE
THE
BIBLE
THE
CHURCH
THAT
CHOOSE
UNDER
GRACE
OF
COURSE
THE
CANON
OF
SCRIPTURE
PROTESTANT
LUDICROSITY
I
THOUGHT
WAS
SHOWN
BY
PROTESTANTS
BREATHTAKING
ACCEPTANCE
OF
LUTHERS
RIGHT
TO
REJECT
A
DOZEN
OR
SO
BOOKS
HE
DISLIKED
BUT
RECENTLY
I
READ
PETER
BROWNS
BODY
AND
SOCIETY
IT
IS
VERY
WELL
RESEARCHED
AND
WELL
WRITTEN
BUT
IS
RAISES
SOME
VERY
UPSETTING
QUESTIONS
THE
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
WERE
WEIRD
EVEN
MORE
SO
THAN
TODAYS
CARZY
FUNDIES
THEY
HAD
ODD
VIEWS
ON
SEX
ODDER
VIEWS
ON
THE
BODY
TOTALLY
LUDICROUS
VIEWS
ABOUT
DEMONS
AND
DISTINCTLY
UNCHARITABLE
VIEWS
ABOUT
OTHER
HUMAN
BEINGS
NOW
THE
QUESTION
IS
THIS
WERE
THE
FIRST
CHRISTIANS
JUST
AS
WEIRD
BUT
WEVE
GOT
USED
TO
THEM
OR
DID
THE
PRISTINE
FALL
OF
THE
CHURCH
HAPPEN
WITHIN
ONE
GENERATION
IT
CERTAINLY
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
THE
TRIUMPH
OF
THE
CHURCH
UNDER
CONSTANTINE
IF
SO
WHA
DOES
THIS
SAY
ABOUT
GODS
PROMISE
TO
ALWAYS
SUPPORT
THE
CHURCH
ITS
NO
USE
THROWING
THE
USUAL
PROTESTANT
PIETIES
ABOUT
THE
CHURCH
NOT
BEING
AN
ORGANIZATION
AT
ME
ITS
A
COMMUNITY
OR
IT
IS
NOTHING
AND
IT
WAS
THE
EARLY
COMMUNITIES
THAT
WERE
WEIRD
THE
INSTITIONAL
CHURCH
WAS
A
MODEL
OF
SANITY
BY
COMPARISON
I
WOULD
BE
INTERESTED
IN
SERIOUS
CATHOLIC
AND
ORTHODOX
RESPONSES
TO
THIS
ENTIRELY
SERIOUS
ISSUE
IM
NOT
SURE
IT
IS
AN
ISSUE
FOR
PROTESTANTS
WITH
THEIR
SOUL
ALONE
WITH
JESUS
APPROACH
BUT
FOR
WE
WHO
SEE
THE
ECCLESIA
AS
A
KOINOIA
OVER
TIME
AND
SPACE
THE
WEIRD
EARLY
CHRISTIANS
ARE
A
PROBLEM
THIS
IS
AN
EXAGGERATION
OF
THE
PROTESTANT
VIEW
MANY
PROTESTANTS
HAVE
A
STRONG
APPRECIATION
FOR
THE
ROLE
OF
THE
CHURCH
THE
SOUL
ALONE
WITH
GOD
IS
CERTAINLY
IMPORTANT
FOR
PROTESTANTS
BUT
ITS
BY
NO
MEANS
THE
WHOLE
STORY
I
HAVE
READ
THE
SORT
OF
HISTORY
YOU
TALK
ABOUT
AS
YOU
POINT
OUT
PROTESTANTS
DONT
HAVE
QUITE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
YOU
DO
BECAUSE
WE
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CHURCH
HAD
A
FALL
AT
SOME
POINT
HOWEVER
PROTESTANT
MYTHOLOGY
TYPICALLY
PLACES
THE
FALL
AROUND
THE
TIME
OF
CONSTANTINE
OR
MORE
LIKELY
REGARD
IT
AS
HAPPENING
IN
A
SORT
OF
CUMULATIVE
FASHION
STARTING
FROM
CONSTANTINE
BUT
GETTING
WORSE
AS
THE
POPE
ACCUMULATED
POWER
DURING
THE
MEDIEVAL
PERIOD
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
HAVING
IT
EARLIER
ARE
SOMEWHAT
WORRISOME
EVEN
TO
US
MOST
PROTESTANTS
ACCEPT
THE
THEOLOGICAL
RESULTS
OF
THE
EARLY
ECUMENICAL
COUNCILS
INCLUDING
SUCH
ITEMS
AS
THE
TRINITY
AND
INCARNATION
INDEED
IN
THE
WORKS
OF
REFORMERS
SUCH
AS
LUTHER
AND
CALVIN
YOULL
FIND
CHURCH
FATHERS
SUCH
AS
AUGUSTINE
QUOTED
ALL
THE
TIME
I
THINK
YOULL
FIND
MANY
PROTESTANTS
RESISTANT
TO
THE
IDEA
THAT
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
AS
A
WHOLE
WAS
WIERD
THERE
IS
AN
ADDITIONAL
PROBLEM
FOR
PROTESTANTS
THAT
I
DONT
MUCH
WANT
TO
TALK
ABOUT
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
SINCE
ITS
BEEN
LOOKED
AT
RECENTLY
THATS
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
ONE
CAN
REALLY
THINK
OF
AUGUSTINE
AND
OTHER
FATHERS
AS
BEING
PROTOPROTESTANTS
THEIR
VIEWS
ON
MARY
THE
AUTHORITY
OF
THE
POPE
ETC
ARE
NOT
ENTIRELY
CONGENIAL
TO
PROTESTANT
THOUGHT
ONE
THING
THAT
SOMEWHAT
WORRIES
ME
IS
A
QUESTION
OF
METHODOLOGY
THERE
ARE
CERTAINLY
PLENTY
OF
WIERD
PEOPLE
IN
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
WHAT
CONCERNS
ME
IS
THAT
THEY
MAY
BE
OVERREPRESENTED
IN
WHAT
WE
SEE
WE
SEE
EVERY
CHRISTIAN
WHO
COURTED
MARTYRDOM
BUT
I
THINK
THERES
GOOD
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
MOST
ORDINARY
CHRISTIANS
WERE
MORE
PRUDENT
THAN
THAT
WE
SEE
THE
HEROIC
VIRGINS
BUT
I
THINK
THERES
GOOD
REASON
TO
THINK
THAT
MANY
CHRISTIANS
WERE
HAPPILY
MARRIED
I
CANT
HELP
SUSPECTING
THAT
THE
EARLY
CHURCH
HAD
THE
SAME
RANGE
OF
WIERDOS
AND
SANE
PEOPLE
THAT
WE
DO
NOW
I
THINK
THERES
ALSO
A
CERTAIN
LEVEL
OF
REVISIONISM
ACTIVE
IN
HISTORY
AT
THE
MOMENT
I
DONT
MEAN
THAT
THEYRE
MANUFACTURING
THINGS
OUT
OF
WHOLE
CLOTH
BUT
DONT
YOU
THINK
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
TENDENCY
TO
EMPHASIZE
THE
NOVEL
