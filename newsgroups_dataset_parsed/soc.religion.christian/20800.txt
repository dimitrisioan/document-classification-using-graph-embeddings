RE
WAS
JESUS
BLACK
THIS
SUBJECT
SEEMS
TO
BE
INCREDIBLY
INFLAMMATORY
THOSE
WHO
SUBSCRIBE
TO
BIBLICAL
ARCHAEOLOGY
REVIEW
WILL
REMEMBER
A
SPECTACULAR
LETTER
BATTLE
SET
OFF
WHEN
SOMEONE
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
A
FRANKLIN
MINT
AD
BAR
IS
A
GREAT
MAGAZINE
BUT
THE
CONTRAST
BETWEEN
THE
RATHER
SCHOLARLY
ARTICLES
AND
THE
INCREDIBLY
SLEAZY
ADS
IS
EXTREME
IN
THIS
AD
THEY
WERE
HAWKING
A
DOLL
WITH
A
HEAD
BASED
ON
THE
FAMOUS
BUST
OF
NEFERTITI
GIVING
THE
FACE
A
TYPICAL
DOLLPINK
COMPLEXION
THE
LETTER
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
THIS
AS
A
MISREPRESENTATION
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
NEFERTITI
WAS
A
BEAUTIFUL
BLACK
QUEEN
THIS
SET
OFF
AN
EXCHANGE
OF
HOTHEADED
LETTERS
THAN
RAN
FOR
SEVERAL
ISSUES
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
THEY
HAD
AN
ARTICLE
FROM
AN
EGYPTOLOGIST
TITLED
WAS
CLEOPATRA
BLACK
THE
ANSWER
TO
THE
TITLE
IS
NO
SHE
WAS
GREEK
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
HEAR
A
HYSTERICAL
NOTE
IN
MUCH
OF
THE
COMPLAINING
I
PERSONALLY
HAVE
SEEN
ONLY
ONE
BLONDHAIRED
JESUS
IN
THE
NATIONAL
SHRINE
IN
WASH
DC
AND
I
FOUND
IT
VERY
JARRING
WESTERN
REPRESENTATIONS
VARY
ENOURMOUSLY
BUT
IN
GENERAL
THE
IMAGE
OF
IS
OF
A
YOUNGISH
MALE
WITH
DARK
HAIR
AND
BEARD
OF
A
SORT
THAT
CAN
BE
FOUND
MODULO
THE
NOSE
ALL
UP
AND
DOWN
THE
MEDITERRANEAN
ALSO
IF
WHAT
I
REMEMBER
IS
CORRECT
THE
BLACK
MADONNA
DOESNT
REPRESENT
A
PERSON
WITH
NEGROID
FEATURES
IT
IS
BLACK
BECAUSE
OF
AN
ACCIDENT
JOE
BUEHLER
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
ALL
THOSE
MARBLE
STATUES
ONE
IS
PRONE
TO
FORGET
THAT
GREEKS
ARE
RATHER
LIKELY
TO
HAVE
BLACK
HAIR
WHEN
ONE
CROSSES
THE
BOSPORUS
THE
SITUATION
BREAKS
DOWN
COMPLETELY
ARE
TURKS
WHITE
HOW
ABOUT
PERSIANS
OR
VARIOUS
GROUPS
IN
THE
INDIAN
SUBCONTINENT
WAS
GANDHI
WHITE
HOW
ABOUT
THE
ARABS
OR
PICTURE
NASSAR
AND
SADAT
STANDING
SIDE
BY
SIDE
AND
THEN
THERE
ARE
THE
ETHIOPIANS
THOSE
OF
A
WHITE
RACIST
BENT
ARE
NOT
LIKELY
TO
SAY
THAT
ANY
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
WHITE
IE
OF
THE
RACISTS
RACE
IF
I
MAY
RISK
A
POTENTIALLY
INFLAMMATORY
REMARK
ONE
UNDERCURRENT
OF
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
IDENTIFICATION
OF
MODERN
JEWS
AS
MEMBERS
OF
THE
OPPRESSOR
RACE
CONSIDERING
THE
EXTREME
DICOTOMY
BETWEEN
MEDIEVAL
RELIGION
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
AND
MEDIEVAL
ANTISEMITISM
ON
THE
OTHER
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THIS
JESUS
WAS
WHITE
THESIS
EVER
PLAYED
THE
ROLES
THAT
SOME
HOLD
IT
DID
REPRESENTATIONS
OF
JESUS
AS
BLACK
OR
KOREAN
OR
WHATEVER
ARE
FINE
IT
SEEMS
AWFULLY
SELFSERVING
TO
INSIST
THAT
JESUS
BELONGS
TO
ONES
OWN
RACIAL
GROUP
C
WINGATE
THE
PEACE
OF
GOD
IT
IS
NO
PEACE
BUT
STRIFE
CLOSED
IN
THE
SOD
MANGOECSUMDEDU
YET
BROTHERS
PRAY
FOR
BUT
ONE
THING
TOVEMANGOE
THE
MARVLOUS
PEACE
OF
GOD
