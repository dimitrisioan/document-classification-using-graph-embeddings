RE
CERTAINTY
AND
ARROGANCE
A

SWEETHEART
HUMAN
BRAINS
ARE
INFESTED
WITH
SIN
AND
THEY
CAN
ONLY
BE
TRUSTED
IN
VERY
LIMITED
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
WOULD
BEG
TO
DIFFER
WITH
YOU
HERE
THE
PROPERLYFORMED
CONSCIENCE
CAN
BE
TRUSTED
VIRTUALLY
ALL
THE
TIME
I
AM
NOT
SO
SURE
THOUGH
ABOUT
SOMETHING
SO
MATERIALISTIC
AS
THE
HUMAN
BRAIN
DOES
THAT
MASS
OF
TISSUE
POSSESS
ANYTHING
TRUSTWORTHY
YOUR
OBSERVATION
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
VALID
IF
WE
WERE
DISCUSSING
THE
MIND
OF
AN
ANIMAL
BUT
THE
HUMAN
BEING
IS
ONLY
HALF
ANIMAL
AS
IT
WERE
AND
HALF
SPIRITUAL
AT
THE
MOMENT
HE
STOPS
SPEAKING
AND
PEOPLE
START
INTERPRETING
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ERROR
APPEARS
DID
HE
MEAN
THAT
LITERALLY
OR
NOT
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
RECORD
THAT
HE
ELABORATED
ON
THE
WORDS
WAS
HE
THINKING
OF
TRAN
OR
CON
SUBSTATIATION
HE
DIDNT
SAY
WE
INTERPRET
THIS
PASSAGE
USING
OUR
BRAINS
WE
THINK
AND
REASON
AND
DRAW
CONCLUSIONS
BUT
WE
KNOW
THAT
OUR
BRAINS
ARE
NOT
PERFECT
OUR
THINKING
OFTEN
LEADS
US
WRONG
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
MOST
OF
US
HAVE
DIRECT
EXPERIENCE
OF
NOW
YOU
HAVE
HIT
ON
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THE
CHURCH
IT
IS
BY
NECESSITY
THE
INFALLIBLE
INTERPRETER
OF
DIVINE
REVELATION
WITHOUT
THE
CHURCH
CHRISTIANITY
WOULD
BE
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
BUNCH
OF
LITTLE
DIVISIVE
SECTS
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
INFALLIBLE
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
THINGS
YOU
CAN
BE
CERTAIN
OF
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
DOCTRINES
RELY
ON
FALLIBLE
HUMAN
THINKING
THEY
CANNOT
BE
CERTAIN
THIS
ARGUMENT
OF
YOURS
REGARDING
THE
CERTAINTY
OF
AN
OBSERVATION
OR
A
CONCLUSION
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
SUBSTANTIATED
BY
EXPERIENCE
IT
REMINDS
ME
OF
THE
THEORETICAL
PHYSICIST
WHO
SAID
THAT
YOU
CAN
NEVER
BE
CERTAIN
OF
A
MEASURMENT
BECAUSE
THE
SENSOR
INTERFERES
WITH
THE
FIELD
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
MEASURE
NOW
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
PHYSICIST
WILL
REPLY
THAT
ALTHOUGH
THE
MEASUREMENT
CAN
NEVER
BE
MADE
WITH
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
HE
IS
ABLE
TO
DETERMINE
THE
CERTAINTY
WITH
WHICH
THE
MEASUREMENT
CAN
BE
MADE
AND
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
IS
OFTEN
SUFFICIENT
TO
RENDER
THE
MEASUREMENT
USEFUL
ENOUGH
TO
ALLOW
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
TRUE
CONDITION
OF
THE
FIELD
UNDER
OBSERVATION
THEREFORE
ALTHOUGH
OUR
MINDS
ARE
FINITE
AND
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
ERROR
OUR
COMPETENCE
IN
ARRIVING
AT
INDUCTIVE
INSIGHTS
GIVES
CONFIDENCE
IN
OUR
ABILITY
TO
DISTINGUISH
WHAT
IS
TRUE
FROM
WHAT
IS
NOT
TRUE
EVEN
IN
AREAS
NOT
SUBJECT
