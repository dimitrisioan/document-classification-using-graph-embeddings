LIKE
TO
GET
YOUR
COMMENTS
ON
A
QUESTION
THAT
HAS
BEEN
ON
MY
MIND
A
LOT
WHAT
MORALSETHICS
APPLY
TO
DREAMS
AND
OUTOFBODY
INCIDENTS
IN
NORMAL
DREAMS
YOU
CANT
CONTROL
ANYTHING
SO
OBVIOUSLY
YOU
ARENT
MORALLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
YOUR
ACTIONS
BUT
IF
YOU
CAN
CONTRIVE
TO
CONTROL
THE
ACTION
IN
DREAMS
OR
DO
AN
OOBE
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
A
MORALITY
APPLIES
WELL
I
AM
ONE
OF
THOSE
APPARENTLY
ODD
PEOPLE
WHO
CAN
SOMETIMES
CONTROL
THEIR
DREAMS
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
MIGHT
DECIDE
BEFORE
GOING
TO
SLEEP
THAT
I
WANT
TO
REPEAT
A
FAVOURITE
DREAM
OR
DREAM
ABOUT
A
SPECIFIC
PLACE
OR
IF
I
AM
HAVING
AN
UNPLEASANT
DREAM
I
CAN
OFTEN
NOT
ALWAYS
REDIRECT
EVENTS
TO
SOMETHING
MORE
PLEASANT
I
GUESS
I
THINK
THAT
THE
SAME
STANDARDS
APPLY
IN
THESE
DIRECTED
DREAMS
AS
APPLY
IN
WAKING
FANTASIES
OR
REAL
LIFE
REF
JESUS
TEACHING
ABOUT
LOOKING
AT
A
WOMAN
LUSTFULLY
BEING
THE
SAME
A
COMMITTING
ADULTARY
WHEN
MY
NORMAL
DREAMS
DISPLAY
THEMES
THAT
I
WOULD
NOT
CONCIOUSLY
CHOSE
TO
DREAM
ABOUT
I
TAKE
THAT
AS
A
SIGN
THAT
ALL
IS
NOT
WELL
WITH
MY
INNER
LIFE
MAYBE
I
HAVE
UNDERLYING
TENSTIONSFEARS
THAT
NEED
TO
BE
RESOLVED
OR
MAYBE
ITS
STRAIGHTFORWARD
SIN
IN
EITHER
CASE
THE
CAUSE
NEEDS
TO
BE
RESOLVED
IN
FACT
EITHER
CASE
IS
PRETTY
RARE
I
DONT
OFTEN
REMEMBER
DREAMS
THAT
I
DONT
CHOSE
TO
HAVE
WHEN
I
DO
THEY
ALMOST
ALWAYS
TELL
ME
SOMETHING
IMPORTANT
I
ALSO
ALMOST
NEVER
DREAM
IN
PICTURES
AND
ESPECIALLY
NOT
IN
COLOUR
IN
FACT
IVE
HAD
PRECISELY
ONE
FULL
COLOUR
PICTURE
DREAM
THAT
I
CAN
REMEMBER
AND
IT
WAS
DEFINATELY
SPIRITUALLY
IMPORTANT
I
TEND
TO
DREAM
IN
SOUND
WITH
THE
ODD
BLURRED
IMAGE
IN
BLACK
AND
WHITE
INTERESTING
TOPIC
ILL
BE
FASCINATED
TO
READ
OTHER
RESPONSES
ALISON
PS
JUST
TO
MAKE
IT
CLEAR
I
DONT
DO
AND
HAVE
NEVER
TRIED
OOBES
I
TEND
TO
THINK
THEY
ARE
OFF
LIMITS
FOR
CHRISTIANS
