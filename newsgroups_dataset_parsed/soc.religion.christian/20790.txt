RE
SERBIAN
GENOCIDE
WORK
OF
GOD
D
ANDREW
KILLE
WRITES
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
GOD
SUPPORTS
GENOCIDE
PERHAPS
THE
GERMANS
WERE
PUNISHING
JEWS
ON
GODS
BEHALF
ANY
GOD
WHO
WORKS
THAT
WAY
IS
INDESCRIBABLY
EVIL
AND
UNWORTHY
OF
MY
WORSHIP
OR
FAITH
THE
BIBLE
DOES
TELL
US
THAT
GOVERNMENTS
ARE
ORDAINED
BY
GOD
ROMANS
AND
FURTHERMORE
GOD
FOREKNOWS
EVERYTHING
THAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IT
IS
JUST
TO
DIFFICULT
FOR
HUMANS
TO
GRAPS
WITH
OUR
LIMITED
MINDS
THE
INEVITABLITY
OF
THE
SUCESS
OF
GODS
PLAN
AND
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
HARD
TO
GRASP
WHEN
WE
SEE
GOVERNEMNTS
DOING
EVIL
HOWEVER
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
DOING
EVIL
AND
WE
SHOULD
NOT
COOPERATE
WITH
THEM
WHEN
THEY
DO
SUCH
IT
MUST
BE
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
WHAT
GOD
WANTED
SO
AS
TO
LEAD
TO
THE
FINAL
SUCESS
OF
HIS
PLAN
TO
SAVE
AS
MANY
SOULS
FROM
HELL
AS
IS
POSSIBLE
IN
SHORT
THE
SLAUGHTER
IN
BOSNIA
THOUGH
DEPLORABLE
IN
THE
EYES
OF
GOD
MAYBE
THEN
AGAIN
THEY
MIGHT
BE
GETTING
THEIR
JUST
DESERTS
NOW
RATHER
THAN
LATER
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
EXAMPLES
OF
GOD
KILLING
PEOPLE
FOR
THEIR
SINS
ONAN
IN
THE
OLD
TESTMAMENT
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
ANNIAS
AND
SPAHIRA
IN
THE
NEW
IS
WHAT
HE
WILLED
TO
HAPPEN
SO
THAT
HIS
PLAN
MIGHT
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
BUT
DONT
FORGET
IT
IS
NOT
UNBIBLICAL
FOR
GOD
TO
USE
ONE
NATION
TO
EXECUTE
HIS
JUST
JUDGEMENT
UPON
ANOTHER
THE
ROMANS
WERE
USED
TO
FULFILL
THE
CHORUS
OF
LET
HIS
BLOOD
BE
UPON
OUR
HANDS
OF
THE
CROWD
IN
JERSUALEM
AND
CHALDEA
WAS
CHASTISED
BY
BABYLON
WHICH
GOT
ISRAEL
WHICH
WAS
INTURN
GOTTEN
BY
PERSIA
ETC
GOD
DOES
USE
NATIONS
TO
PUNISH
OTHER
NATIONS
AS
THE
BIBLE
VERY
CLEARLY
SHOWS
IN
THE
OLD
TESTAMENT
DONT
YOU
REMEMBER
THE
WORDS
OF
GOD
RECORDED
IN
DANIEL
MENE
MENE
TEKEL
PERES
BABYLON
HAD
BEEN
WEIGHED
IN
THE
BALANCE
SCALES
OF
GODS
JUSTICE
FOUND
SEVERLY
WANTING
AND
WAS
THUS
GIVEN
OVER
TO
THE
PERSIANS
AS
THEIR
DUE
PUNISHMENT
FOR
THEIR
REBELLION
ANOTHER
EXAMMPLE
IS
THE
EXTIRMINATION
OF
THE
CANNANITES
ORDERED
BY
GOD
AS
THE
TASK
OF
ISRAEL
THE
CANNANITES
HAD
BEEN
GIVEN
THEIR
CHANCE
FOUND
SEVERLY
WANTING
AND
THE
GREAT
JUDGE
CARRIED
OUT
HIS
JUST
SENTENCE
ACCRODINGLY
I
COULD
GO
ON
WITH
MORE
EXAMPLES
BUT
I
SEE
LITTLE
NEED
TO
DO
SO
AS
MY
POINT
IS
QUITE
CLEAR
TWO
THINGS
NEED
TO
BE
REMEMBERED
AT
ALL
TIMES
IT
IS
NOT
UP
TO
US
TO
QUESTION
WHY
GOD
HAS
ORDERED
THE
WORLD
AS
HE
HAS
IN
HIS
DIVINE
WISDOM
HE
MADE
THE
WORLD
AS
WAS
BEST
IN
HIS
EYES
AND
LIKE
PAUL
SAYS
IN
ROMANS
THE
CLAY
IS
NOT
ONE
TO
TLAK
BACK
TO
THE
POTTER
THE
MESSAGE
OF
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
AS
FOLLOWS
REPENT
NOW
FOR
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
IS
AT
HAND
JESUS
CHRIST
DID
NOT
ALLOW
ANY
TIME
FOR
DILLYDALLYING
LET
THE
DEAD
BURY
THE
DEAD
COME
FOLLOW
ME
THERE
IS
NOT
AN
INFINITE
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
RATHER
CHRIST
IS
PASSING
BY
RIGHT
NOW
CALLING
PEOPLE
TO
FOLLOW
HIM
AND
BECOME
FISHERS
OF
MEN
HE
DOES
NOT
SAY
WELL
ALRIGHT
YOU
CAN
CALL
ME
BACK
IN
A
WEEK
AND
SEE
IF
MY
KINGDOM
FITS
IN
WITH
YOUR
PLANS
HE
SAID
FOLLOW
ME
HIS
MESSAGE
IS
NOT
IM
JUST
A
SWEETYPIE
WHO
WOULD
NEVER
HURT
A
FLY
YOUVE
GOT
ALL
THE
TIME
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
DIVINE
JUDGEMENT
THATS
ONLY
A
FAIRY
TALE
OUR
GREAT
GOD
AND
SAVIOR
JESUS
CHRIST
TITUS
IS
ALSO
THE
JUST
AND
RIGHTEOUS
JUDGE
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
IT
IS
NOT
UP
TO
THE
DEFENDANTS
IN
THE
TRIAL
TO
BE
QUESTIONING
HIS
ENTIRELY
JUST
SENTENCES
OF
EITHER
CHASTISEMENT
OR
MERCY
D
ANDREW
BYLER
DOES
NOT
HE
WHO
WAYS
THE
HEART
PERCEIVE
SIN
AND
WILL
HE
NOT
JUDGE
MEN
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
WORKS
PROVERBS
