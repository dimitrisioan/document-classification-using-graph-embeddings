AARON
BRYCE
CARDENAS
WRITES
COLOSSIANS
IN
HIM
YOU
WERE
ALSO
CIRCUMCISED
IN
THE
PUTTING
OFF
OF
THE
SINFUL
NATURE
NOT
WITH
A
CIRCUMCISION
DONE
BY
CHRIST
HAVING
BEEN
BURIED
WITH
HIM
IN
BAPTISM
AND
RAISED
WITH
HIM
THROUGH
YOUR
FAITH
IN
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
WHO
RAISED
HIM
FROM
THE
DEAD
IN
BAPTISM
WE
ARE
RAISED
TO
A
NEW
LIFE
IN
CHRIST
ROMANS
THROUGH
A
PERSONAL
FAITH
IN
THE
POWER
OF
GOD
OUR
PARENTS
FAITH
CANNOT
DO
THIS
DO
INFANTS
HAVE
FAITH
LETS
LOOK
AT
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
HAS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
IT
I
DONT
THINK
THE
ISSUE
OF
WHETHER
INFANTS
HAVE
FAITH
IS
RELEVANT
OR
NOT
CERTAINLY
THEY
CAN
AS
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
JOHN
IN
UTERO
PROVES
I
FIND
THE
TRANSLATION
OF
COL
ABOVE
ODD
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
CIRCUMCISION
OF
CHRIST
WHICH
THE
KJV
AND
RSV
PUT
IN
TERMS
OF
CHRISTS
CRICUMCISION
WHICH
WE
IN
UNION
WITH
HIM
PARTICIPATE
IN
PUTTING
OFF
THE
BODY
OF
SINS
OF
THE
FLESH
ALSO
PERHAPS
COR
IS
DIVIDING
THE
ACT
OF
BURIAL
WITH
HIM
IN
BAPTISM
WHICH
CAN
BE
INDEPENDANT
OF
FAITH
FROM
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
RISING
WITH
CHRIST
BY
FAITH
WHO
SAYS
BOTH
ARE
BY
FAITH
THIS
INTERPRETATION
HAS
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
EXPLAINING
THOSE
WHO
ARE
FAITHLESSLY
BAPTIZED
FOR
WHOM
THEIR
BAPTISIM
IS
NOT
BENEFIT
BUT
SERVES
TO
PUT
THEM
INTO
THE
KINGDOM
NONETHELESS
LIKE
THE
ISRAELITES
ALL
OF
THEM
CHILDREN
INCLUDED
WHO
WERE
BAPTIZED
IN
THE
CLOUD
AND
IN
THE
SEA
IT
WAS
OF
NO
ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE
THEY
DID
NOT
ADD
TO
THEIR
BAPTISM
FAITH
AND
OBEDIENCE
BAPTISM
DOES
NOT
IMPART
FAITH
NOR
IS
IT
DONE
STRICTLY
SPEAKING
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
FAITH
OF
THE
PARENT
BUT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
COVCENANT
PROMISE
OF
GOD
IT
IMPARTS
GRACE
THE
GRACE
OF
THE
KINGDOM
WHICH
CAN
BE
A
PUNISHEMENT
IN
DISGUISE
IF
THERE
IS
LATER
APOSTACY
ROMANS
BUT
NOT
ALL
THE
ISRAELITES
ACCEPTED
THE
GOOD
NEWS
FOR
ISAIAH
SAYS
LORD
WHO
HAS
BELIEVED
OUR
MESSAGE
CONSEQUENTLY
FAITH
COMES
FROM
HEARING
THE
MESSAGE
AND
THE
MESSAGE
IS
HEARD
THROUGH
THE
WORD
OF
CHRIST
SO
THEN
WE
RECEIVE
GODS
GIFT
OF
FAITH
TO
US
AS
WE
HEAR
THE
MESSAGE
OF
THE
GOSPEL
FAITH
IS
A
POSSIBLE
RESPONSE
TO
HEARING
GODS
WORD
PREACHED
KIDS
ARE
NOT
YET
SPIRITUALLY
INTELLECTUALLY
OR
EMOTIONALLY
MATURE
ENOUGH
TO
RESPOND
TO
GODS
WORD
HENCE
THEY
CANNOT
HAVE
FAITH
AND
THEREFORE
CANNOT
BE
RAISED
IN
BAPTISM
TO
A
NEW
LIFE
DO
YOU
TEACH
A
CHILD
TO
PRAY
THE
LORDS
PRAYER
DO
YOU
EXPECT
THEM
TO
NOT
STEAL
THEY
CAN
HAVE
FAITH
APPROPRIATE
TO
THEIR
CONDITION
AND
IN
THE
NEW
COVENANT
WE
SHALL
NO
LONGER
SAY
KNOW
THE
LORD
FOR
THEY
SHALL
ALL
KNOW
HIM
FROM
THE
LEAST
UNTO
THE
GREATEST
HEB
IF
YOU
READ
ALL
OF
EZEKIEL
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
GOD
DOESNT
HOLD
US
GUILTY
FOR
ANYONE
ELSES
SINS
SO
WE
CAN
HAVE
NO
ORIGINAL
GUILT
FROM
ADAM
BUT
ALSO
ACCORDING
TO
EZEKIEL
GOD
WILL
NOT
HOLD
INNOCENT
ANYONE
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
ANYONE
ELSES
INNOCENSE
THUS
JESUS
COULD
NOT
BE
OUR
FEDERAL
HEAD
ANY
MORE
THAN
ADAM
IF
THATS
WHAT
EZEKIEL
IS
TALKING
ABOUT
SHALL
YOU
MAKE
EZEKIEL
CONTRADICT
THE
SECOND
COMMANDEMNT
AS
WELL
EZEKIEL
RID
YOURSELVES
OF
ALL
THE
OFFENSES
YOU
HAVE
COMMITTTED
AND
GET
A
NEW
HEART
AND
A
NEW
SPIRIT
WHY
WILL
YOU
DIE
O
HOUSE
OF
ISRAEL
FOR
I
TAKE
NO
PLEASURE
IN
THE
DEATH
OF
ANYONE
DECLARES
THE
SOVEREIGN
LORD
REPENT
AND
LIVE
THE
WAY
TO
PLEASE
GOD
IS
TO
REPENT
AND
GET
A
NEW
HEART
AND
SPIRIT
KIDS
CANNOT
DO
THIS
ACTS
SAYS
THAT
WHEN
WE
REPENT
AND
ARE
BAPTIZED
WE
WILL
THEN
RECEIVE
A
NEW
SPIRIT
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THEN
WE
SHALL
LIVE
EZEKIEL
INDICATES
THAT
THIS
NEW
HEART
WILL
BE
GIVEN
BY
GOD
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
THE
SPRINKLING
OF
WATER
IN
BAPTISM
IT
IS
THE
ACTION
OF
GOD
PUTING
THEM
INTO
HIS
NEW
ORDER
AND
NOT
A
QUESTION
OFPERSONAL
FAITH
AS
SUCH
ROMANS
THEREFORE
JUST
AS
SIN
ENTERED
THE
WORLD
THROUGH
ONE
MAN
AND
DEATH
THROUGH
SIN
AND
IN
THIS
WAY
DEATH
CAME
TO
ALL
MEN
BECAUSE
ALL
SINNED
SIN
AND
DEATH
ENTERED
THE
WORLD
WHEN
THE
FIRST
MAN
SINNED
DEATH
CAME
TO
EACH
MAN
BECAUSE
EACH
MAN
SINNED
NOTE
THAT
ITS
GOOD
TO
READ
THROUGH
ALL
OF
ROMANS
SOME
OF
THE
VERSES
ARE
EASIER
TO
MISUNDERSTAND
THAN
OTHERS
BUT
IF
WE
READ
THEM
IN
CONTEXT
WE
WILL
SEE
THAT
THEY
ARE
ALL
SAYING
BASICALLY
THE
SAME
THING
LETS
LOOK
AT
ONE
SUCH
BUT
THE
DEATH
THAT
CAME
TO
ALL
BECAUSE
OF
SIN
IS
NOT
JUST
THEIR
PERSONAL
DEATH
BUT
THE
DEAD
STATE
ORIGINBAL
SIN
WE
ARE
IN
A
COVENANT
OF
DEATH
BECAUSE
ADAM
OUR
FEDERAL
HEAD
GAVE
OVER
HIS
DOMINION
TO
THE
DEVIL
AND
DEATH
PSALM
SURELY
I
WAS
SINFUL
AT
BIRTH
SINFUL
FROM
THE
TIME
MY
MOTHER
CONCEIVED
ME
THIS
WHOLE
PSALM
IS
A
WONDERFUL
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
WE
SHOULD
HUMBLE
OURSELVES
BEFORE
GOD
IN
REPENTANCE
FOR
SINNING
DAVID
HIMSELF
WAS
A
MAN
AFTER
GODS
OWN
HEART
AND
WROTE
THE
PSALM
AFTER
COMMITTING
ADULTRY
WITH
BATHSHEBA
AND
MURDERING
HER
HUSBAND
ALL
THAT
DAVID
IS
SAYING
HERE
IS
THAT
HE
CANT
REMEMBER
A
TIME
WHEN
HE
WASNT
SINFUL
HE
IS
HUMBLING
HIMSELF
BEFORE
GOD
BY
CONFESSING
HIS
SINFULNESS
HIS
SAYING
THAT
HE
WAS
SINFUL
AT
BIRTH
IS
A
HYPERBOLE
THE
BIBLE
BEING
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
ISNT
LIMITED
TO
A
LITERAL
INTERPETATION
BUT
ALSO
USES
FIGURES
OF
SPEECH
AS
DID
JESUS
JOHN
FOR
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
OF
HYPERBOLE
SEE
LUKE
WHILE
THIS
PSALM
IS
FIGURATIVE
IN
ITS
LANGUAGE
IT
IS
NOT
HYPERBOLIC
AND
THE
ONE
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
IMPLY
THE
OTHER
THERE
IS
NOT
OTHER
HYPERBOLIC
LANGUAGE
IN
THIS
PSALM
WHAT
V
IS
LIKELY
REFERING
TO
IS
WHAT
IS
SYMBOLIZED
BY
THE
OT
CLEANLINESS
LAWS
WHICH
MAKE
INTERCOURSE
AND
CHILDBRITH
BOTH
ACTS
WHICH
CAUS
UNCLEANNES
AND
SEPERATION
FROM
GOD
THE
WHOLE
PSALM
IS
IN
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
OT
RITUAL
HYSSOP
CLEANSING
BURNT
OFFERING
ETC
DAVIDS
SIN
WITH
BATHSHEBA
INCLUDED
THIS
ELEMENT
AS
HE
DID
NOT
RITUALLY
CLEANSE
HIMSELF
WHEN
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
BUT
WHAT
WAS
SYMBOLIZED
BY
THE
OT
RITUAL
WAS
THE
TRUTH
THAT
SIN
WAS
PASSED
GENERATIONALLY
THATS
WHY
THE
ORGAN
OF
GENERATION
HAD
TO
BE
CUT
THATS
WHY
BRITH
WAS
UNCLEAN
UNCLEANNESS
WAS
DEATH
AND
ALL
BABIES
WERE
BORN
DEAD
AND
NEEDED
TO
BE
WASHED
TO
NEWNESS
OF
LIFE
WHICH
WE
HAVE
IN
BAPTISM
TODAY
