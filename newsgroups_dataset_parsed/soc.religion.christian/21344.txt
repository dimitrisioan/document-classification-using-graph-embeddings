RE
QUESTION
ABOUT
VIRGIN
MARY
DAVE
DAVIS
WRITES
MUCH
DELETION
HE
IS
TRYING
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
IMMACULATE
CONCEPTION
AND
THE
ASSUMPTION
OF
MARY
ORIGINAL
SIN
IS
THE
ONLY
REASON
FALLEN
HUMANITY
DIES
ADAM
AND
EVE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
DIED
HAD
THEY
NOT
FALLEN
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
THAN
WHY
IN
THE
GENESIS
STORY
IS
GOD
CONCERNED
THAT
ADAM
AND
EVE
MIGHT
ALSO
EAT
FROM
THE
TREE
OF
LIFE
AND
LIVE
FOREVER
AND
BE
LIKE
GODS
EATING
OF
THE
TREE
OF
LIFE
WOULD
NOT
TAKE
AWAY
THE
EFFECTS
OF
EATING
OF
THE
TREE
OF
KNOWLEDGE
IS
THERE
ANY
REASON
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THEY
HAD
ALREADY
EATEN
OF
THE
TREE
OF
LIFE
AND
SO
HAD
ALREADY
ATTAINED
TO
ETERNAL
LIFE
IF
SO
WHAT
BASIS
IS
THERE
FOR
SAYING
THAT
THIS
WAS
TAKEN
AWAY
FROM
THEM
TO
ME
THE
WAGES
OF
SIN
ARE
A
SPIRITUAL
DEATH
NOT
NECESSARILY
A
PHYSICAL
DEATH
I
CAN
ATTEST
TO
THE
TRUTH
OF
THIS
INTERPRETATION
FROM
MY
OWN
EXPERIENCE
I
SUSPECT
THAT
MANY
OTHERS
COULD
ATTEST
TO
THIS
AS
WELL
