RE
CERTAINTY
AND
ARROGANCE
DARREN
DR
NANCYS
SWEETIE
KILROYGBOROROWANEDU
WRITES
DARREN
IN
AN
EARLIER
ARTICLE
I
EXPLAINED
THAT
WHAT
MANY
PEOPLE
FIND
DARREN
ARROGANT
ABOUT
CHRISTIANS
IS
THAT
SOME
CHRISTIANS
PROFESS
DARREN
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
ABOUT
THEIR
BELIEFS
AND
DOCTRINES
AND
DARREN
IN
SHORT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
NO
MATTER
HOW
GOOD
YOUR
SOURCES
DARREN
ARE
IF
ANY
PART
OF
YOUR
DOCTRINES
OR
BELIEFS
REST
ON
YOUR
OWN
DARREN
THINKING
AND
REASONING
THEN
THOSE
DOCTRINES
ARE
SUSPECT
THE
POINT
THAT
DARREN
RAISES
IS
A
VERY
LUTHERAN
VIEWPOINT
WHILE
REASON
IS
A
GIFT
FROM
GOD
IT
IS
ALSO
INFECTED
BY
SIN
YET
WE
DO
NOT
REJECT
REASON
ENTIRELYAND
NEITHER
I
THINK
DOES
DARREN
WE
NEED
REASON
AS
DARREN
HIMSELF
HAS
POINTED
OUT
TO
COMPREHEND
GODS
REVELATION
OF
HIMSELF
IN
THE
BIBLE
BUT
REASON
ALONE
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
TO
COMPREHEND
AND
BELIEVE
THE
WORD
WE
NEED
FIRST
AND
FOREMOST
FAITH
FOR
THE
SINFUL
MIND
IS
HOSTILE
TO
GOD
IT
DOES
NOT
SUBMIT
TO
GODS
LAW
NOR
CAN
IT
DO
SO
ROMANS
LUTHER
ACCEPTED
SCRIPTURE
AS
THE
SOLE
MEANS
OF
REVELATION
SOLA
SCRIPTURA
BUT
ACCEPTED
THE
NECESSITY
OF
THE
USE
OF
REASON
WITH
FAITH
IN
COMPREHENDING
THAT
REVELATION
YET
LUTHER
ALSO
SAID
REGARDING
BAPTISM
BUT
MAD
REASON
RUSHES
FORTH
AND
BECAUSE
BAPTISM
IS
NOT
DAZZLING
LIKE
THE
WORKS
WHICH
WE
DO
REGARDS
IT
AS
WORTHLESS
LARGE
CATECHISM
FOURTH
PART
BAPTISM
TO
MAKE
MATTERS
MORE
COMPLICATED
LUTHER
WAS
THE
SORT
OF
THEOLOGIAN
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
WOULD
DESCRIBE
AS
AN
ABSOLUTIST
IVE
SEEN
HIM
DESCRIBED
AS
A
TAKE
NO
PRISONERS
THEOLOGIAN
WE
MIGHT
CONCLUDE
GIVEN
THESE
OBSERVATIONS
THAT
LUTHER
WAS
INCONSISTENT
OR
MAD
AND
SURELY
AT
LEAST
SOME
HAVE
COME
TO
THAT
CONCLUSION
BUT
IT
MIGHT
BE
USEFUL
TO
RECALL
THAT
JESUS
WAS
ALSO
CALLED
MAD
AND
PETER
FELT
COMPELLED
TO
DEFEND
HIMSELF
AND
THE
APOSTLES
AGAINST
A
CHARGE
OF
DRUNKENNESS
ON
PENTECOST
SO
WE
AS
CHRISTIANS
OUGHT
TO
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
REJECTING
LUTHER
OR
OTHERS
AS
MAD
RATHER
WE
SHOULD
IMITATE
THE
BEREANS
WHO
EXAMINED
THE
SCRIPTURES
EVERY
DAY
TO
SEE
IF
WHAT
PAUL
SAID
WAS
TRUE
ACTS
THE
BASIS
FOR
THE
CONFIDENCE
WITH
WHICH
LUTHER
PETER
PAUL
AND
MANY
OTHERS
PREACHED
THE
GOSPEL
WAS
NOT
JUST
REASON
BUT
FAITH
AND
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
THIS
IS
NOT
FAITH
DIVORCED
FROM
REASON
BUT
A
FAITH
THAT
GUIDES
INFORMS
AND
USES
REASON
THE
SPIRIT
ENABLES
US
TO
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
AND
TO
PROCLAIM
IT
BOLDLY
GOD
DOES
NOT
WANT
US
TO
PREACH
THE
MESSAGE
THAT
I
THINK
THAT
JESUS
MIGHT
HAVE
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
BUT
RATHER
I
KNOW
THAT
MY
REDEEMER
LIVES
JOB
THE
CHRISTIAN
DOES
NOT
SIDE
WITH
PILATE
IN
SAYING
WHAT
IS
TRUTH
BUT
RATHER
FOLLOWS
CHRIST
WHO
SAID
IN
FACT
FOR
THIS
REASON
I
WAS
BORN
AND
FOR
THIS
I
CAME
INTO
THE
WORLD
TO
TESTIFY
TO
THE
TRUTH
EVERYONE
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
TRUTH
LISTENS
TO
ME
JOHN
WE
CAN
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
BECAUSE
GOD
HAS
PROMISED
US
THAT
WE
CAN
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
JESUS
SAID
IF
YOU
HOLD
TO
MY
TEACHINGS
YOU
ARE
REALLY
MY
DISCIPLES
THEN
YOU
WILL
KNOW
THE
TRUTH
AND
THE
TRUTH
WILL
SET
YOU
FREE
JOHN
THE
PROVERBS
URGE
US
BUY
THE
TRUTH
AND
DO
NOT
SELL
IT
PR
THE
PSALMIST
PRAYED
DO
NOT
SNATCH
TO
WORD
OF
TRUTH
FROM
MY
MOUTH
PS
EVIDENTLY
HE
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
WORD
OF
TRUTH
WAS
IN
FACT
IN
HIS
MOUTH
YET
WE
DO
INDEED
APPEAR
ARROGANT
IF
OUR
CLAIM
TO
THE
TRUTH
IS
MOTIVATED
BY
SELFGLORIFICATION
BUT
IF
WE
PRESENT
THE
TRUTH
AS
THE
TEACHINGS
OF
SCRIPTURE
REVEALED
BY
THE
SPIRIT
AND
NOT
OUR
OWN
INVENTION
AND
IF
WE
STAND
READY
TO
BE
PROVED
WRONG
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
SCRIPTURE
AS
LUTHER
DID
THEN
WE
ARE
NOT
ARROGANT
BUT
HUMBLE
WE
SHOULD
HUMBLY
TRUST
IN
GODS
PROMISE
OF
TRUTH
JUST
AS
WE
TRUST
IN
HIS
PROMISE
OF
FORGIVENESS
REXLEX
IT
IS
ONLY
BECAUSE
OF
GODS
OWN
REVELATION
THAT
WE
CAN
BE
REXLEX
ABSOLUTE
ABOUT
A
THING
DARREN
BUT
HOW
FAR
DOES
THAT
GET
YOU
ONCE
GODS
REVELATION
STOPS
DARREN
AND
YOUR
OWN
REASONING
BEGINS
POSSIBILITY
FOR
ERROR
APPEARS
I
AGREE
THAT
WE
MUST
MAKE
A
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
THE
CLEAR
TEACHINGS
OF
SCRIPTURE
AND
THE
PRODUCTS
OF
OUR
OWN
REASONEVEN
WHEN
SUCH
REASONING
IS
BASED
ON
SCRIPTURE
HOWEVER
I
THINK
I
WOULD
DRAW
THE
LINE
OF
DISTINCTION
MORE
REASONABLY
AND
LESS
ACADEMICALLY
THAN
YOU
WOULD
DARREN
FOR
EXAMPLE
LETS
SUPPOSE
THAT
OUR
MODERN
BIBLE
TRANSLATIONS
DARREN
INCLUDE
A
PERFECT
RENDERING
OF
JESUS
WORDS
AT
THE
LAST
SUPPER
DARREN
AND
THAT
JESUS
SAID
EXACTLY
THIS
IS
MY
BODY
DARREN
WELL
PRESUME
THAT
WHAT
HE
SAID
WAS
TOTALLY
WITHOUT
ERROR
AND
DARREN
ABSOLUTELY
TRUE
WHAT
CAN
WE
BE
CERTAIN
OF
NOT
MUCH
DARREN
AT
THE
MOMENT
HE
STOPS
SPEAKING
AND
PEOPLE
START
DARREN
INTERPRETING
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
ERROR
APPEARS
DID
HE
MEAN
DARREN
THAT
LITERALLY
OR
NOT
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
RECORD
THAT
HE
DARREN
ELABORATED
ON
THE
WORDS
WAS
HE
THINKING
OF
TRAN
OR
CON
DARREN
SUBSTANTIATION
HE
DIDNT
SAY
DARREN
IS
ALMOST
AT
THE
POINT
OF
MAKING
A
VERY
LUTHERAN
STATEMENT
ABOUT
THE
LORDS
SUPPER
THE
LUTHERAN
APPROACH
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
IF
JESUS
SAID
THIS
IS
MY
BODY
THEN
THAT
IS
WHAT
WE
SHOULD
BELIEVE
OTHER
INTERPRETATIONS
ARE
REJECTED
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
TAUGHT
IN
SCRIPTURE
RECALL
THAT
JESUS
WORDS
DO
NOT
STAND
ALONE
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
WE
ALSO
HAVE
PAULS
WORDS
IN
CORINTHIANS
WHICH
HE
PASSED
ON
TO
US
WHAT
HE
RECEIVED
FROM
THE
LORD
IN
PARTICULAR
HE
SAID
FOR
WHENEVER
YOU
EAT
THIS
BREAD
AND
DRINK
THIS
CUP
YOU
PROCLAIM
THE
LORDS
DEATH
UNTIL
HE
COMES
BY
THESE
WORDS
WE
SHOULD
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BREAD
THAT
WE
EAT
IN
THE
LORDS
SUPPER
REALLY
IS
BREAD
AS
WELL
AS
THE
LORDS
BODYAS
OUR
SENSES
IN
FACT
TELL
US
DOES
THIS
PROVE
THAT
TRANSUBSTANTIATION
IS
FALSE
I
SUPPOSE
SOMEONE
COULD
SAY
THAT
PAUL
SPOKE
METAPHORICALLY
OF
THE
LORDS
BODY
AS
BREAD
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
WAY
THE
BODY
APPEARS
WHEN
WE
EAT
IT
BUT
THIS
THOUGHT
IS
FOUND
NOWHERE
IN
SCRIPTURE
SO
WE
REJECT
IT
THUS
THE
PRIMARY
REASON
FOR
REJECTING
TRANSUBSTANTIATION
IS
NOT
THAT
WE
CAN
PROVE
IT
FALSE
BUT
THAT
IT
IS
SIMPLY
NOT
FOUND
IN
SCRIPTURE
SIDE
REMARK
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THE
LUTHERAN
DOCTRINE
ON
REAL
PRESENCE
IS
CONSUBSTANTIATION
BUT
IT
HAS
BEEN
NONLUTHERANS
WHO
HAVE
TOLD
ME
THIS
WE
TEND
NOT
TO
USE
THE
WORD
I
ALMOST
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
USED
MORE
BY
PROFESSORS
OF
COMPARATIVE
RELIGION
WHO
NEED
LABELS
TO
COMPARE
CATHOLIC
LUTHERAN
AND
REFORMED
TEACHINGS
ON
THE
LORDS
SUPPER
BUT
ALMOST
EVERY
CHURCH
WANTS
TO
CALL
THEIR
OWN
TEACHING
REAL
PRESENCE
BECAUSE
THAT
WAS
THE
TRADITIONAL
TEACHING
OF
THE
CHURCH
END
SIDE
REMARK
DARREN
WHEN
CHRISTIANS
SPEAK
AS
IF
THEY
BELIEVE
THEIR
OWN
REASONING
DARREN
CAN
NEVER
LEAD
THEM
ASTRAY
WHEN
WE
IMPLICITLY
CLAIM
THAT
WE
DARREN
ARE
INFALLIBLE
THE
NON
CHRISTIANS
AROUND
US
RARELY
BELIEVE
DARREN
THAT
IMPLICIT
CLAIM
WITNESSING
IS
HARDLY
GOING
TO
WORK
WHEN
DARREN
THE
PERSON
YOU
ARE
TALKING
TO
BELIEVES
THAT
YOU
ARE
EITHER
TOO
DARREN
FOOLISH
TO
RECOGNISE
YOUR
OWN
LIMITS
OR
INTENTIONALLY
TRYING
DARREN
TO
COVER
THEM
UP
THIS
IS
PRECISELY
WHY
CHRISTIANS
SHOULD
NOT
RELY
ON
RATIONALIZATIONS
IN
THEIR
WITNESSING
IT
IS
FAR
BETTER
TO
TAKE
THE
APPROACH
ID
LIKE
TO
SHOW
YOU
WHAT
SCRIPTURE
SAYS
YOU
DECIDE
FOR
YOURSELF
WHETHER
TO
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
DARREN
REXLEX
SUGGESTED
THAT
PEOPLE
READ
HE
IS
THERE
AND
HE
IS
NOT
DARREN
SILENT
BY
FRANCIS
SCHAEFFER
I
DIDNT
THINK
VERY
HIGHLY
OF
DARREN
IT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
MR
SCHAEFFER
IS
GROSSLY
OVERRATED
BY
MANY
DARREN
EVANGELICAL
CHRISTIANS
SOMEBODY
ELSE
MIGHT
LIKE
IT
THOUGH
DARREN
SO
DONT
LET
MY
OPINION
STOP

FROM

IT
