RE
HELP
NEEDED
CALLBACKS
ACTIONS
AND
EVENTS
I
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
METHODS
TO
CONNECT
APPLICATION
CODE
TO
WIDGETS
CALLBACKS
AND
ACTIONS
THE
PROBLEM
I
FACE
NOW
IS
THAT
I
HAVE
A
QUITE
LONG
PIECE
OF
APPLICATION
CODE
THAT
PERFORMS
A
LOT
OF
DRAWING
INTO
A
WINDOW
I
WANT
TO
CONNECT
THIS
TO
A
WIDGET
NO
PROBLEM
SO
FAR
I
COULD
USE
A
CALLBACK
FUNCTION
OR
AN
ACTION
TO
DO
THIS
PROCESSING
ANY
EVENTS
AFTERWARDS
BUT
BECAUSE
THE
DRAWING
TAKES
SOME
WHILE
I
WANT
THE
APPLICATION
CODE
SEQUENCE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BE
INTERRUPTED
BY
EVENTS
THEN
I
WANT
TO
HANDLE
THE
EVENTS
AND
RESUME
WITH
PROCESSING
THE
APPLICATION
CODE
AT
THE
POINT
IT
WAS
INTERRUPTED
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
ISNT
POSSIBLE
BUT
HOW
CAN
I
GIVE
THE
USER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
HIS
INPUTS
ARE
IMMEDIATELY
PROCESSED
USE
A
WORKPROC
SEE
YOU
SHOULD
SPLIT
YOUR
DRAWING
ROUTNIE
UP
INTO
SMALL
CHUNKS
THIS
IS
THE
HARD
PART
THEN
IN
THE
CALLBACK
THAT
STARTS
THE
DRAWING
YOU
CALL
XTAPPADDWORKPROC
TO
CALL
YOUR
WORKPROC
THE
FIRST
TIME
YOUR
WORKPROC
SHOULD
BE
A
FUNCTION
THAT
RETURNS
A
BOOLEAN
TRUE
WHEN
YOU
ARE
FINISHED
AND
FALSE
WHEN
YOU
WANT
TO
KEEP
PROCESSING
IF
YOU
RETURN
FALSE
THE
WORKPROC
IS
AUTOMATICALLY
REINSTALLED
NOTE
THAT
THIS
METHOD
IS
BETTER
THAT
USING
A
TIMEOUT
LOOP
SINCE
EVENTS
GET
PROCESSED
IN
A
MORE
PRECEDENCEORIENTED
MANNER
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
THE
SAME
ADA
BINDINGS
I
AM
HOWEVER
YOU
ARE
HOSED
AND
SHOULD
