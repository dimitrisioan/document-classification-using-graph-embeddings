OVERRIDING
WINDOW
MANAGER
FOCUS
PROCESSING
I
AM
WORKING
ON
AN
XWINDOW
BASED
APPLICATION
THAT
NEEDS
TO
OVERRIDE
SOME
OF
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
FOCUS
PROCESSING
I
AM
USING
AND
MOTIF
CURRENTLY
ALTHOUGH
I
WILL
ALSO
BE
WORKING
WITH
OPEN
LOOK
IN
THE
FUTURE
WHAT
I
NEED
TO
DO
IS
UNDER
CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
PREVENT
THE
USER
FROM
SWITCHING
FROM
ONE
WINDOW
OF
THE
APPLICATION
TO
ANOTHER
WINDOW
LETS
SAY
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
WINDOW
A
IS
ON
TOP
OF
WINDOW
B
IN
THE
WINDOW
HIERARCHY
NORMALLY
IF
THE
USER
CLICKS
THE
MOUSE
IN
WINDOW
B
IT
WILL
BE
BROUGHT
TO
THE
TOP
OF
THE
WINDOW
HIERARCHY
AND
PLACED
ON
TOP
OF
WINDOW
A
UNDER
CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
IF
THE
USER
CLICKS
THE
MOUSE
IN
WINDOW
B
I
NEED
TO
BEEP
AND
PREVENT
WINDOW
B
FROM
BEING
RAISED
ON
TOP
OF
WINDOW
A
FROM
THE
RESEARCH
AND
TESTING
IVE
DONE
SO
FAR
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THIS
WINDOW
ORDERING
IS
HANDLED
BY
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
IN
THIS
CASE
MOTIF
I
HAVENT
FOUND
ANY
WAY
TO
OVERRIDE
THIS
DEFAULT
PROCESSING
THROUGH
STANDARD
X
WINDOW
FUNCTIONS
I
CAN
TELL
WHEN
THIS
SWITCHING
OCCURS
THROUGH
FOCUS
CHANGE
AND
MAPPING
NOTIFY
EVENTS
BUT
I
CANT
FIND
ANY
WAY
TO
TELL
MOTIF
NOT
TO
MAKE
THE
SWITCH
THE
TEMPORARY
SOLUTION
IVE
CURRENTLY
COME
UP
WITH
IS
VERY
KLUDGY
BUT
IT
PARTIALLY
WORKS
WHEN
I
DETECT
SUCH
A
WINDOW
SWITCH
IN
THOSE
CASES
WHEN
THE
SWITCH
IS
NOT
ALLOWED
I
MANUALLY
FORCE
THE
FORMERLY
TOP
WINDOW
BACK
ON
TOP
WITH
AN
XRAISEWINDOW
CALL
AND
BEEP
WITH
THE
XBELL
FUNCTION
THIS
PROVIDES
THE
NECESSARY
FUNCTIONALITY
BUT
LOOKS
UGLY
WHEN
THE
WINDOWS
SWITCH
PLACES
TWICE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
I
CAN
TELL
MOTIF
OR
PREFERABLY
ANY
WINDOW
MANAGER
WHEN
I
DONT
WANT
THE
WINDOW
ORDER
SWITCH
TO
ACTUALLY
TAKE
PLACE
RESPOND
