from
hpux
augmented
by
the
athena
and
mu
libraries
from
an
distribution
from
iworksecnuiowaedu
it
compiles
nicely

for
one
file
the
preprocessor
macro
definition
table
size
needed
to
be
increased
but
when
executed
nothing
happens
at
all
except
for
evergrowing
memory
requirements
eventually
climaxing
in
a
core
dump
the
binary
of
the
identical
program
compiled
on
with
has
no
problems
other
programs
like
xtpanel
compile
link
and
run
just
fine
with
the
same
libraries

this
sound
familiar
or

i
going
to
have
to
figure
this
one
out
on
my
own
please
