WRITES
IVE
RUN
INTO
A
BIT
OF
A
SNAG
WHILE
TRYING
TO
GET
MAC
X
UP
AND
RUNNING
AND
WOULD
APPRECIATE
STUFF
DELETED
ARE
NOT
ON
MY
LOCAL
NET
HERE
BUT
THE
ABOVE
PROBLEM
HOLDS
TRUE
FOR
NONLOCAL
SUNS
AS
WELL
I
TRIED
TO
SEND
THIS
AS
PRIVATE
MAIL
BUT
MAIL
TO
BENJOSSAHQNASAGOV
WAS
REJECTED
SO
HERE
IT
IS
SAME
HERE
HERE
IS
AN
EXTRACT
FROM
THE
README
FILE
THAT
COMES
WITH
MACX
USERS
OF
REMOTE
COMMANDS
WITH
SUN
MACHINES
MAY
FIND
THAT
THEIR
REMOTE
COMMANDS
APPEAR
TO
DO
NOTHING
AND
THERE
IS
NO
OUTPUT
FROM
THE
SUN
MACHINE
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
A
FEATURE
OF
THE
SUN
REXECD
NETWORK
DAEMON
WHICH
QUIETLY
DISCONNECTS
FROM
REQUESTING
MACHINES
THAT
ARE
NOT
KNOWN
TO
THE
SUNS
NETWORK
ADDRESS
ETCHOSTS
OR
NIS
HOSTS
DATABASE
TO
SUCCESSFULLY
USE
REMOTE
COMMANDS
WITH
A
SUNOSBASED
MACHINE
THERE
MUST
BE
AN
ENTRY
IN
THE
NETWORK
ADDRESS
DATABASE
FOR
THE
MACINTOSH
WHICH
IS
RUNNING
MACX
I
RECEIVED
SIMILAR
INFORMATIONADVICE
ABOUT
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
BENJAMIN
HAS
AND
I
STILL
HAVE
NIS
HAS
ALL
THE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
THE
MACS
I
EVEN
PUT
EXPLICIT
ENTRIES
IN
ETCHOSTS
TO
NO
AVAIL
MONITORING
WITH
SNOOP
ON
MY
CLASSIC
THE
INITIAL
REXEC
PACKET
IS
SENT
TO
THE
THE
SUN
WHICH
SENDS
SOMETHING
TO
THE
CORRECT
MAC
BUT
NOTHING
APPEARS
AT
THE
MAC
REXECD
IS
NUMBER
ONE
SUSPECT
BUT
ITS
MORE
SUBLE
THAN
THE
README
SUGGESTS
AND
I
HAVENT
YET
LOOKED
INTO
IT
FURTHER
