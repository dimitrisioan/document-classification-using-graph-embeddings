RE
QUESTION
REGARDING
OVERLAYING
OF
GRAPHICS
LETS
SAY
I
HAVE
TWO
RECTANGLES
ON
THE
CANVASSEE
ABOVE
ONE
INTERSECTING
THE
OTHER
NOW
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DELETE
ONE
OF
THE
RECTANGLES
THE
WAY
I
DO
IT
IS
TO
CREATE
ANOTHER
GC
WHEREIN
I
USE
THE
GXXOR
LOGICAL
FUNCTION
AND
SIMPLY
REDRAW
THE
RECTANGLE
USING
THE
NEWLY
CREATED
GRAPHICS
CONTEXT
THUS
DELETING
IT
FOR
ALL
APPARENT
PURPOSES
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
IS
THAT
AT
THE
POINTS
OF
INTERSECTION
THE
PIXEL
LOCATIONS
BELONGING
TO
THE
OTHER
RECTANGLE
ALSO
BECOME
WHITE
WHICH
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
YOU
COULD
SET
UP
A
BITMAP
WITH
A
MASK
IN
IT
CLEAR
THE
BITMAP
DRAW
THE
RECTANGLE
TO
BE
DELETED
WITH
GXOR
DRAW
THE
ONE
THAT
IS
TO
STAY
WITH
GXCLEAR
THEN
GXXOR
THE
ENTIRE
PIXMAP
WITH
THE
SCREEN
NOTE
THAT
THIS
IS
A
PRETTY
EFFECTIVE
WAY
OF
ANIMATION
IF
YOU
EVER
NEED
TO
DO
THAT
REPLACE
THE
GXCLEAR
WITH
A
GXXOR
