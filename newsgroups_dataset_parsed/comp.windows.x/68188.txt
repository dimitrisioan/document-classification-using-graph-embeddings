keycode
wrong
for
xkeyreleasedevent
i
am
writing
a
xbased
dosemu
which
requires
xkeyreleasedevent
i
found
the
keycode
of
xkeyreleasedevent
is
wrong
if
i
run
the
program
on
a
linux
with
display
set
to
the
local
linux
and
to
the
sun
host
the
two
keycodes
from
the
two
xservers
are
different
of
course
the
keycode
of
xkeypressedevent
is
ok
can
anybody
verify
this
did
i
