OK
IM
BEING
DRIVEN
BATTY
TRYING
TO
CREATE
POPUPMENUS
IE
PRESS
AND
A
MENU
APPEARS
I
WOULD
REALLY
LIKE
TO
USE
THE
STANDARD
ATHENA
CLASSES
TO
ACHIEVE
THIS
GOAL
BUT
FOR
MY
BEST
ATTEMPTS
I
CANNOT
GET
THE
MENUS
TO
COME
UP
WITHOUT
USING
A
MENUBUTTON
AS
THE
PARENT
OF
THE

TREE
I
KNOW
THIS
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
TO
WITH
AN

AND
A
LITTLE
TWIDDLING

SOMETHING
IS
ESCAPING

KNOCKED

WHAT
YOU
WANT
USING

EVEN
IF
YOU
ARE
NOT

THE

IS
SO
SIMPLE
IT
SHOULD
BE
PRETTY
OBVIOUS
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
THE
CRUCIAL

IS
