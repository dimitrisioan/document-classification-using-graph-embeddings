re
button
popup
menus
with
athena
widgets
ok
im
being
driven
batty
trying
to
create
popupmenus
ie
press
and
a
menu
appears
i
would
really
like
to
use
the
standard
athena
classes
to
achieve
this
goal
but
for
my
best
attempts
i
cannot
get
the
menus
to
come
up
without
using
a
menubutton
as
the
parent
of
the
widget
tree
i
know
this
should
be
possible
to
to
with
an
xtpopupspringloaded
and
a
little
twiddling
but
something
is
escaping
me
read
the
documentation
for
the
simplemenu
positioning
the
simplemenu
the
reference
is
to
the
documentation
i
had
not
done
this
before
but
in
less
than
mins
i
knocked
up
the
following
wcl
application
that
does
what
you
want
using
a
command
widget
even
if
you
are
not
familiar
with
wcl
the
example
is
so
simple
it
should
be
pretty
obvious
what
is
going
on
the
crucial
thing
is
the
use
of
the
xawpositionsimplemenu
and
menupopup
actions
