pulldown
menu
periodically
hangs
application
on
openwindows
has
anyone
found
a
fix
for
the
following
problem
client
software
sunos
server
hardware
sun
ipc
server
software
sunos
open
windows
w
patch
a
motif
application
will
periodically
hang
when
run
against
the
openwindows
server
xnews
the
pulldown
is
displayed
but
then
no
button
actions
have
any
effect
sometimes
pressing
return
will
unstick
the
application
but
not
usually
it
looks
like
the
pulldown
is
grabbing
the
focus
and
never
letting
go
other
windows
on
the
display
continue
to
get
updated
so
the
server
isnt
hanging
if
i
log
in
from
another
terminal
and
kill
the
motif
application
then
everything
gets
back
to
normal
the
same
application
when
run
against
other
x
servers
including
mit
xsun
decwindows
tektronix
x
terminal
has
no
problems
this
is
obviously
a
openwindows
problem
but
i
need
a
workaround
since
most
of
our
customers
are
openwindows
users
i
have
tried
the
following
things
installing
the
latest
version
of
the
openwindows
server
patch
using
mwm
version
instead
of
olwm
applying
the
patch
specified
in
the
motif
faq
question
this
had
the
effect
of
disabling
the
pointandclick
method
of
menu
interaction
as
opposed
to
the
clickanddrag
method
and
screwing
up
the
menu
mnemonics
keys
it
did
seem
to
help
but
i
was
still
able
to
get
the
application
to
hang
repeat
by
this
is
an
intermittent
problem
so
youll
have
to
try
several
times
click
and
release
on
a
menu
heading
pulldown
menu
will
pop
up
click
and
release
on
a
menu
item
repeat
until
application
hangs
any
help
would
be
appreciated
thanks
in
advance
