xcutsel
or
xcb
question
i
want
to
do
something
like
this
date
xcb
s
xcutsel
to
get
the
output
of
the
date
command
put
into
the
xprimary
selection
unfortunately
xcutsel
is
an
interactive
little
bugger
and
there
isnt
a
command
argument
to
tell
it
to
just
do
it
and
not
put
up
its
little
window
so
is
there
some
other
command
that
i
can
use
like
this
or
is
there
an
analog
to
xcb
that
will
put
stuff
in
xprimary
instead
of
cut
