MIKE
BELL
WRITES
APOLOGIES
FOR
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
READ
THIS
BEFORE
BUT
NOONE
HAS
SOLVED
THIS
ONE
YET
SO
IM
POSTING
AGAIN
SORRY
IM
HAVING
PROBLEMS
CREATING
A
CURSOR
BIGGER
THAN
IM
USING
MOTIF
RUNNING
HPUX
ALL
THE
FUNCTIONS
RETURN
VALID
RESULTS
BUT
NO
CURSOR
APPEARS
WHEN
THE
BITMAP
IS
BIGGER
THAN
THE
AFOREMENTIONED
SIZE
I
TRIED
USING
THE
FOLLOWING
CODE
UNSIGNED
INT
WH
XQUERYBESTCURSORXTDISPLAYPROGRAMAREA
XTWINDOWPROGRAMAREA
W
H
TO
RETURN
THE
NEAREST
SIZE
TO
WHAT
I
REQUIRE
HOWEVER
IT
RETURNS
AND
AS
THE
WIDTH
AND
HEIGHT
RESPECTIVELY
WHAT
AM
I
DOING
WRONG
AND
IF
NOT
HOW
CAN
I
GET
ROUND
THE
PROBLEM
DOES
THE
WORKSTATION
YOURE
USING
HAVE
HARDWARE
CURSOR
SUPPORT
OR
DOES
THE
SERVER
GENERATE
A
SOFTWARE
CURSOR
YOU
CAN
GENERALLY
TELL
THE
DIFFERENCE
JUST
BY
USING
IT
IF
THE
CURSOR
BLINKS
A
LOT
WHEN
THERES
SCREEN
ACTIVITY
ITS
PROBABLY
A
SOFTWARE
CURSOR
IF
IT
HAS
A
HARDWARE
CURSOR
I
THINK
YOURE
PROBABLY
BATTLING
A
BUG
IN
HPS
X
SERVER
IM
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
ANY
HARDWARE
CURSOR
CHIPS
THAT
DISPLAY
CURSORS
GREATER
THAN
ITS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
SERVER
IS
JUST
ECHOING
YOUR
PREFERRED
CURSOR
SIZE
WITHOUT
ACTUALLY
CHECKING
IT
I
VAGUELY
RECALL
THAT
VERY
OLD
MIT
SERVER
REVISIONS
DID
JUST
THAT
IN
REALITY
YOURE
PROBABLY
STUCK
WITH
A
MAXIMUM
SIZE
CURSOR
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
THE
SERVER
RETURNS
