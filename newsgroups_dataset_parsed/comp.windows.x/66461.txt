HOW
TO
DISABLE
REVERSE
VIDEO
ON
XTERMMAN
WELL
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
THE
RIGHT
NEWSGROUP
TO
ASK
BUT
LET
ME
TRY
ANYWAY
I
AM
RUNNING
XTERM
AND
LIKE
ALL
UNIX
USERS
I
RUN
MAN
SOMETHING
RECENTLY
I
SWITCHED
TO
SOLARIS
AND
THEIR
MAN
PAGES
ARE
LITTERED
WITH
I
DIRECTIVES
THAT
ARE
SOMEHOW
TRANSLATED
INTO
REVERSE
VIDEO
WHEN
DISPLAYED
BY
MAN
UNDER
XTERM
THE
RESULTING
OUTPUT
ADMITTEDLY
A
PERSONAL
TASTE
IS
VERY
ANNOYING
TO
LOOK
AT
BACK
WHEN
I
WAS
USING
SUNOS
I
REMEMBER
THEIR
MAN
PAGES
HAVE
SOME
KEYWORDS
DISPLAYED
WITH
UNDERLINING
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
HOW
DO
I
CHANGE
THE
XTERMS
BEHAVIOUR
UNDER
I
DIRECTIVES
FOR
NROFF
MAN
PAGES
TO
PERHAPS
UNDERLINING
OR
AT
LEAST
DISABLING
IT
B
DIRECTIVES
ARE
FINE
I
LIKE
THEM
AND
OF
COURSE
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GO
IN
AND
EDIT
THE
MAN
PAGES
INPUTS
SOMEHOW
XTERM
ALLOWS
ONE
TO
SPECIFY
BOTH
A
NORMAL
FONT
AND
A
BOLD
FONT
BUT
NOT
AN
ITALIC
FONT
ANY
POINTERS
SUGGESTIONS
ARE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
THANKS
JOHN
PS
RUNNING
XTERM
RV
WONT
WORK
I
TRIED
