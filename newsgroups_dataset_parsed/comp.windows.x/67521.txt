greetings
i
am
developing
an
application
that
allows
a
user
to
interactively
createeditview
a
visual
model
ie
topology
of
their
network
and
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
knew
of
any
builder
tools
that
exist
to
simplify
this
task
in
the
past
i
have
used
visual
edges
uimx
product
to
develop
other
guis
so
i
am
familiar
with
uimss
in
general
the
topology
will
support
objects
and
connecting
links
once
the
topology
is
created
i
want
to
provide
the
user
with
capabilities
to
support
grouping
zooming
etc
i
am
looking
for
some
form
of
a
higher
abstraction
other
than
x
drawing
routines
to
accomplish
this
specifically
the
zooming
and
grouping
aspects
may
prove
difficult
and
certainly
time
consuming
if
i
have
to
roll
my
own
suggestions

you
dont
mention
your
platform
but
digital
has
a
custom
widget
neted
which
does
exactly
what
you
want
to
do
cost
is
nominal
or
so
call
your
local
office
the
widget
is
supported
on
a
variety
of
platforms
and
i
heard
rumblings
of
porting
to
sun
etc
so
it
may
be
worth
the
check
