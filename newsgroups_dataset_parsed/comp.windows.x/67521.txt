GREETINGS
I
AM
DEVELOPING
AN
APPLICATION
THAT
ALLOWS
A
USER
TO
INTERACTIVELY
CREATEEDITVIEW
A
VISUAL
MODEL
IE
TOPOLOGY
OF
THEIR
NETWORK
AND
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
KNEW
OF
ANY
BUILDER
TOOLS
THAT
EXIST
TO
SIMPLIFY
THIS
TASK
IN
THE
PAST
I
HAVE
USED
VISUAL
EDGES
UIMX
PRODUCT
TO
DEVELOP
OTHER
GUIS
SO
I
AM
FAMILIAR
WITH
UIMSS
IN
GENERAL
THE
TOPOLOGY
WILL
SUPPORT
OBJECTS
AND
CONNECTING
LINKS
ONCE
THE
TOPOLOGY
IS
CREATED
I
WANT
TO
PROVIDE
THE
USER
WITH
CAPABILITIES
TO
SUPPORT
GROUPING
ZOOMING
ETC
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
SOME
FORM
OF
A
HIGHER
ABSTRACTION
OTHER
THAN
X
DRAWING
ROUTINES
TO
ACCOMPLISH
THIS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
ZOOMING
AND
GROUPING
ASPECTS
MAY
PROVE
DIFFICULT
AND
CERTAINLY
TIME
CONSUMING
IF
I
HAVE
TO
ROLL
MY
OWN
SUGGESTIONS
GREG

YOU
DONT
MENTION
YOUR
PLATFORM
BUT
DIGITAL
HAS
A
CUSTOM
WIDGET
NETED
WHICH
DOES
EXACTLY
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
COST
IS
NOMINAL
OR
SO
CALL
YOUR
LOCAL
OFFICE
THE
WIDGET
IS
SUPPORTED
ON
A
VARIETY
OF
PLATFORMS
AND
I
HEARD
RUMBLINGS
OF
PORTING
TO
SUN
ETC
SO
IT
MAY
BE
WORTH
THE
CHECK
