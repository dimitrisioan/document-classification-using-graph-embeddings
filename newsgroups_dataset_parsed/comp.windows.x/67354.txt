are
generated
on
application
exit
im
writing
an
application
running
under
x
using
motif
and
i
need
to
do
some
stuff
when
the
application
quits
now
when
i
shut
down
my
x
windows
session
it
doesnt
seem
to
send
a
sigterm
or
whatever
signal
to
my
application
im
trapping
various
signals

therefore
i
thought
i
could
use
an
x
signal
to
check
for
my
top

window
being
destroyed
however
i
seem
to
get
destroynotify
events
whenever
i
move
windows
is
there
any
way
for
me
to
check
that
the
window
is
actually
being
destroyed
some
field
to
check
or
some
combination
of
events
