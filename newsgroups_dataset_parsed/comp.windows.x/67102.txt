RE
XDM
DECNET
DOES
XDM
WORK
WITH
DECNET
I
HAVE
AN
ULTRIX
MACHINE
RUNNING
BOTH
TCPIP
AND
DECNET
I
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
XTERMINALS
HANGING
OFF
THE
ULTRIX
HOST
ALSO
RUNNING
TCPIP
AND
DECNET
PRESENTLY
I
AM
USING
XDM
FOR
THE
LOGIN
PROCEDURE
ON
THE
XTERMINALS
USING
TCPIP
SINCE
XDM
IS
BASICALLY
JUST
AN
XWINDOWS
CLIENT
SHOULDNT
I
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
XDM
ON
THE
DECNET
PROTOCOL
TOWER
AS
WELL
XDM
IS
NOT
JUST
AN
X
WINDOW
CLIENT
XDM
HAS
ITS
OWN
PROTOCOL
XDMCP
THAT
OPERATES
OF
UCP
ON
PORT
IT
DOES
PROVIDE
A
LOGIN
WINDOW
WHICH
IS
AN
X
WINDOW
CLIENT
AS
TO
USING
DECNET
PROTOCOL
LOOKING
THROUGH
THE
SOURCE
FOR
XDM
FROM
THAT
I
HAVE
HERE
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
BARE
BONES
CODE
IS
THERE
BUT
NOT
COMPLETELY
THERE
MY
FIRST
INCLINATION
IS
THAT
XDM
IS
NOT
YOUR
TYPICAL
X
CLIENT
IT
IS
MAKING
TCPIP
SPECIFIC
SOCKET
CALLS
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
ANSWER
WOULD
BE
NO
YOU
CAN
NOT
RUN
XDM
OVER
DECNET
IS
THIS
RIGHT
OR
NOT
ANY
FEEDBACK
IS
APPRECIATED
THANKS
FROM
MY
LOOK
AT
THE
SOURCE
IT
SEEMS
YOU
CANNOT
RUN
IT
OVER
DECNET
