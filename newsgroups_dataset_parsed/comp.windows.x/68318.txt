YOU
ARE
STUCK
IN
A
DISTRIBUTED
SYSTEM
FEEDBACK
LOOP
WHAT
IF
YOU
ARE
ON
AN
XTERMINAL
OR
RUNNING
XTERM
OVER
THE
NET
TO
ANOTHER
MACHINE
THAT
IS
WHEN
THE
LOAD
PROBLEMS
OCCUR
IF
YOU
HAD
A
MACHINE
WITH
XTERMINALS
ATTACHED
AND
THEY
ALL
HAD
BLINKING
CURSORS
IN
XTERMS
THIS
COULD
REPRESENT
A
CONSIDERABLE
ETHERNET
BANDWIDTH
WASTE
ETHERNET
CERTAINLY
HAS
ENOUGH
BANDWIDTH
FOR
A
FEW
BLINKING
CURSORS
MY
LISP
MACHINE
BLINKS
THE
CURSOR
TWICE
A

AND
UPDATES
THE
TIME
IN
THE

LINE
EVERY
SECOND
THIS
USES
UNDER
BYTESSECOND
OR
ABOUT
OF
THE
BANDWIDTH
OF
ETHERNET
A
HUNDRED
OF
THEM
ON
A
SINGLE
ETHERNET
MIGHT
BE
A
PROBLEM
BUT
A
COUPLE
DOZEN
SHOULD
BE
FINE
BANDWIDTH
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
BE
THE
PROBLEM
EXCEPT
OVER
A
WET
STRING
NETWORK
ONE
OF
MAJOR
FLAWS
OF
X
IS
THE
HORRENDOUS
NUMBER
OF
TRANSACTIONS
AND
HENCE
PROCESS
SWITCHES
THAT
IT
FORCES
UPON
A
HOST
ACTUAL
MEASUREMENTS
HOURLY
AVERAGE
ARE
PER
SECOND
PER
LOGGED
IN
USER
WHICH
CAN
LEAD
TO
OR
MORE
PROCESS
SWITCHES
DEPENDING
ON
WHETHER
EACH
EVENT
IS
FILTERED
BY
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
AS
WELL
AS
THE
APPLICATIONS
AND
HOW
MANY
PROCESSES
ARE
NEEDED
FOR
EACH
CHARACTER
WHILE
A
BLINKING
CURSOR
NEEDS
ONLY
THE
APPLICATION
AND
THE
NETWORKING
PROCESS
AND
DOES
NOT
ADD
ANY
TRANSACTIONS
IT
WILL
ADD
SOMETHING
LIKE
PROCESS
SWITCHES
PER
SECOND
PER
USER
THIS
IS
A
SIGNIFICANT
INCREASE
IN
OVERHEAD
ESPECIALLY
AS
THE
APPLICATION
MAY
HAVE
QUITE
A
LARGE
WORKING
SET
IF
YOU
WANT
A
RAPIDLY
BLINKING
CURSOR
THERE
COULD
BE
AS
MANY
AS
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
GO
THERE
I
WOULDNT
