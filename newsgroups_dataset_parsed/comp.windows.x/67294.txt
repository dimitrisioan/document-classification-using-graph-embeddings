RE
NEED
SHADING
PROGRAM
EXAMPLE
IN
X
I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
POST
WAS
SEARCHING
FOR
EXISTING
IMPLEMENTATIONS
OF
FI
GOUROUDSHADING
OF
TRIANGLES
THIS
IS
FAIRLY
COMPLEX
TO
DO
WITH
PLAIN
X
SIMPLER
SHADING
MODELS
ARE
IMPLEMENTED
ALREADY
FI
IN
ASK
ARCHIE
WHERE
TO
GET
THE
LATEST
VERSION
FOR
GOUROUD
A
FAST
IMPLEMENTATION
WILL
BE
POSSIBLE
UTILIZING
SOME
EXTENSION
ONLY
EITHER
MITSHM
TO
DO
THE
SHADE
IN
AN
IMAGE
AND
FAST
UPDATE
THE
WINDOW
WITH
IT
OR
PEXOPENGL
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
SHADE
THEMSELVES
THE
PORTABLE
VANILLA
X
WAY
WOULD
BE
TO
SHADE
IN
A
NORMAL
XIMAGE
AND
USE
XPUTIMAGE
WHAT
WOULD
BE
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
DO
STATIC
THINGS
AS
FI
FRACTAL
LANDSCAPES
OR
SUCH
STUFF
TO
SPEAK
ABOUT
POVRAY
THE
X
PREVIEWER
THAT
COMES
WITH
THE
ORIGINAL
SOURCE
PACKAGE
IS
NOT
THAT
GOOD
ESPECIALLY
IN
SPEED
PROTOCOLFRIENDLYNESS
AND
ICCCM
COMPLIANCE
HAVE
A
LOOK
ON
MY
OWN
PREVIEW
CODE
IT
IS
ON
THE
README
STATES
THE
POINTS
WHERE
IT
IS
BETTER
THAN
XWINDOWC
FROM
POVRAY
THE
VERSION
I
HAVE
IS
USING
THE
CODE
INSTEAD
OF
THE
DEFAULT
X
WINDOWS
CODE
I
HAVE
IT
CURRENTLY
RUNNING
ON
A
DEC
ALPHA
RUNNING
OPENVMS
AXP
AND
SO
FAR
HAVE
BEEN
PRETTY
IMPRESSED
THE
ONLY
SIDEEFFECT
OF
IS
THAT
IT
REQUIRES
XSTDCMAP
BEST
BE
RUN
BEFORE
IT
WILL
WORK
ANNOYNING

NOT
