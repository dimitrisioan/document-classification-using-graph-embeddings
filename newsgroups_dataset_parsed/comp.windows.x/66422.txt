a

was
developed
by
conrad
kimball
ceksdcboeingcom

why
cant
gcc
compile
on
my
sparc
i
used
gcc
to
compile
the
whole
distribution
but
i
get
several
segmentation
faults
when
running
x
note
first
that
gcc
on
risc
machines
does
not
necessarily
result
in
any
performance
increase
it
certainly
is
not
as
noticeable
as
it
is
on
the
or
vax
platforms
here
is
the
problem
gcc
and
cc
use
incompatible
methods
of
passing
structures
as
arguments
and
returning
them
as
function
values
so
when
gcccompiled
parts
of
x
are
linked
with
sunsupplied
functions
that
pass
or
return
structs
runtime
errors
occur
affected
programs
include
rgb
and
the
server
this
is
from
the
gcc
manual
on
the
sparc
gnu
cc
uses
an
incompatible
calling
convention
for
structures
it
passes
them
by
including
their
contents
in
the
argument
list
whereas
the
standard
compiler
passes
them
effectively
by
reference
this
really
ought
to
be
fixed
but
such
calling
conventions
are
not
yet
supported
in
gnu
cc
so
it
isnt
straightforward
to
fix
it
the
convention
for
structure
returning
is
also
incompatible
and
fpccstructreturn
does
not
help
you
can
duck
the
problem
either
by
using
cc
throughout
or
by
using
it
for
just
the
routines
which
cause
incompatibilities
the
problem
cannot
be
solved
with
compilation
flags
files
which
need
to
be
compiled
using
cc
include
rgbrgbc
in

several

these

to

shape
which
was
introduced
in
the
mit

and
allows
nonrectangular

like
the
other
sample
server

the
shape

will
only
run
on
a
server
which
supports
it
servers
as
well
as
many
vendorsupplied
servers
do
not
support
the
shape
extension
in
which
case
they
will
display
rectangular
windows
anyway
in
order
to
use
the
shape
extension
you
must
link
to
the
library
libxexta
in

this
library
and
the
associated
includes
will
be

if

do
not
despair
many
freeware
programs

use

extension
can
also
be
compiled
without

what
you
are
seeing
is
a

to
get
sun
shared
libraries
working
apparently
you
cant
share
a
function
that
is
both
called
and
compared
as
xtinherit
is
this
was
handled
by
putting
xtinherit
in
the
same

as
a
function
that
is
always
used
thereby
guaranteeing
that
it
would
be
loaded
that
is
in
initializec
where
xttoolkitinitialize
and
xtinitialize
reside
these
routines
would
normally
be
called
you
are
probably
seeing
this
error
because
your
program
is
not
a
normal
xtbased
program
and
does
not
call
xttoolkitinitialize

osfmotifs
uil
had
this
problem
it
called
xtmalloc
and
other
xt

the
solution
is
to
add
the
call
to
your
program
the
function
does
not
have
to
be
executed
just
linked
in
alternatively
your
program
doesnt
need
any
xt
functions
and
is
correct
in
not
calling
xttoolkitinitialize
it
may
be
an
xlib
or
xview
program
in
this
case
you
can
remove
lxt
from

must
ask
the
window
manager
for
the
input
focus
to
do
this
you
must
set
up
what
are
called
hints
for
the
window
manager
if
your

is

you
can
use
something
like
the
following
xwmhints
wmhints
wmhintsflags
inputhint
wmhintsinput
true
xsetwmhintsdpy
window
wmhints
if
your
application
is
based
on
the
xt
intrinsics
you
can
set
the
xtninput
resource
to
be
true
as
you
probably
want
to
in
any
case
if
you
dont
have
source
you
can
start
up
the
application
with
the
resource
inputtrue
certain
window
managers
notably
dxwm
and
olwm
are
very
picky
about
having
this
done
if
you
are
using
suns
openwindows
olwm
you
can
also
add
this
resource
to
your
defaults
file
to
use
clients
that
arent

how
do
i
figure
out
what
window
manager
is
running
you
cant
reliably
tell
whatever
mechanism
you
could
use
could
be
spoofed
in
any
case
for
most
cases
you
shouldnt
care
which
window
manager
is
running
so
long
as
you
do
things
in
an
icccmconformant
manner
there
are
some
cases
in
which
particular
window
managers
are
known
to
do
things
wrong
checking
for
particular
hints
placed
on
the
window
by
the
window
manager
so
that
you
can
sidestep
the
problem
may
be
appropriate
in
these
cases
alternatively
it
may
be
appropriate
to
determine
which
window
manager
is
running
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
specific
added
features
such
as
olwms
pushpin
menus
in
order
to
give
your
program
added
functionality
beware
of
usurping
the
window
managers
functions
by
providing
that
functionality
even
when
it
is
missing
this
surely
leads
to
future
compatibility
problems
subject
is
there
a
skeleton
x
program
available
there
is
no
general
framework
such
as
the
transskel
program
for
the
macintosh
which
handles
lots
of
the
odds
and
ends
and
overhead
of
development
under
a
window
system
and
which
can
be
used
as
a
platform
for
additional
development
in

the
problem
is
typically
solved
by
using
an
interactive
application
builder
tool
or
by
using
cutpaste

you
might
look

this

thing
include
contribclientsxskel
a

puts

why
does
xtgetvalues
not
work
for
me
sic
the
xtgetvalues
interface
for
retrieving
resources
from
a
widget
is
sensitive
to
the
type
of
variable
your
code
may
be
doing
something
like
this
arg
int
i
int
sensitive
oops
wrong
data
type
xtsetarg
argsi
xtnsensitive
sensitive
i
xtgetvalueswidget
args
i
but
xtnsensitive
is
a
boolean
which
on
most
machines
is
a
single
byte
declaring
the
variable
sensitive
as
boolean
works
properly
this
problem
comes
up
often
when
using
particular
toolkits
that
redefine
the
xt
types
dimension
and
position
code
that
assumes
they
are
int
will
have
similar
problems
if
those
types
are
actually
short
in
general
you
are
safe
if
you
use
the
actual
type
of
the
resource
as
it
appears
in
the
widgets
man
page
subject
why
dont
xtconfigurewidgetxtresizewidgetxtmovewidget
work
youre
probably
trying
to
use
these
functions
from
application
code
they
should
be
used
only
internally
to
widgets
these
functions
are
for
a
parent
widget
to
change
the
geometry
of
its
children
other
promising
functions
xtmakegeometryrequest
and
xtmakeresizerequest
are
also
for
use
only
by
widgets
in
this
case
by
a
child
to
request
a
change
from
its
parent
the
only
way
for
your
application
to
request
a
geometry
change
for
a
widget
is
to
issue
an
xtsetvalues
call
setting
some
of
the
geometry
resources
although
this
will
result
in
the
widgetinternal
functions
being
called
your
application
code
must
use
the
standard
xtsetvalues
interface
or
risk
the
widgets
data
becoming
corrupted
the
xlib
calls
xmovewindow
and
xresizewindow
should
similarly
be
avoided
they
shouldnt
be
used
to
change
xtnx
xtny
xtnwidth
or
xtnheight
subject
why
isnt
there
an
xtreparentwidget
call
like
xreparentwindow
although
there
are
various
details
of
the
current
implementation
of
the
xt
internals
which
make
reparenting
difficult
the
major
reason
that
no
such
call
exists
is
that
it
remains
undefined
what
the
set
of
resources
for
the
new
widget
should
be
resources
are
typically
set
based
on
the
location
in
the
instance
hierarchy
what
resources
should
change
if
the
instance
moves
what
should
happen
to
the
widgets
children
and
by
the
time
such
semantics
are
defined
there
would
probably
be
little
advantage
over
destroying
the
old
widget
and
creating
a
new
widget
in
the
correct
location
with
the
desired
resources
as
setting
the
resources
correctly
is
the
majority
of
work
in
creating
a
new
widget
note
that
reparenting
is
possible
in
the
oi
toolkit
