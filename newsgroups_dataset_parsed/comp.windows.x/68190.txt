HEY
FOLKS
IM
ATTEMPTING
TO
USE
IMAKE
TO
MANAGE
MAKEFILES
FOR
A
DEVELOPMENT
EFFORT
AND
WAS
CURIOUS
TO
FIND
OUT
IF
ANYBODY
ELSE
IS
EXPERIENCING
PROBLEMS
WITH
ANY
TARGET
THAT
HAS
SUBDIRS
GENERATED
BY
IMAKE
ON
SOLARIS
PLATFORMS
FOR
EXAMPLE
MAKE
MAKEFILES
CHOKES
IN
THE
VERY
FIRST
SUBDIRECTORY
IE
TARGET
SUBDIRMAKEFILES
NOT
FOUND
YOU
DONT
GIVE
THE
PRECISE
ERROR
MESSAGE
BUT
I
ASSUME
THAT
THE
MAKING
OF
THE
TARGET
FAILS
BECAUSE
MAKE
CANT
FIND
THE
RULES
WEVE
SEEN
THIS
HAPPEN
WITH
SUNOS
MAKE
AS
WELL
AND
AAT
THIS
POINT
IM
NOT
SURE
WHY
IT
HAPPENS
IT
SEEMS
TO
HAPPEN
WITH
LARGE
MAKEFILES
THE
ENTRIES
NEAR
THE
END
GET
LOST
SMALL
CHANGES
IN
THE
MAKEFILE
WILL
REMEDY
THIS
PROBLEM
AS
IT
DOES
IN
YOUR
EXAMPLE
IN
THE
MIT
DISTRIBUTION
THIS
CAN
HAPPEN
WITH
THE
TARGET
MAKEFILES
IN
ONE
OF
THE
DOC
DIRECTORIES
AT
FIRST
I
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
A
BUG
WITH
MAKE
ON
MY
SUN
BUT
I
BUILT
AND
USED
GNUMAKE
WITH
THE
SAME
RESULTS
ATTACHED
YOULL
FIND
THE
FIRST
MAKEFILES
TARGET
RULE
FROM
THE
GENERATED
MAKEFILE
THIS
IS
REALLY
WEIRD
ARE
YOUR
REALLY
SURE
THAT
YOU
WERE
USING
GNU
MAKE
CASPER
