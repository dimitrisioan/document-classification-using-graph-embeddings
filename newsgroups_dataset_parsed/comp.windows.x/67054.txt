as
per
your
question
why
not
have
the
button
handler
add
the
object
and
then
call
the
windowredraw
or
whatever
directly
although
depending
this
design
will
work
but
i
dont
think
it
can
take
easily
take
advantage
of
expose
event
redraw
optimization
that
is
the
whole
window
will
be
redrawn
not
just
the
area
with
the
new
item
ps
im
replying
here
because

didnt
agree
