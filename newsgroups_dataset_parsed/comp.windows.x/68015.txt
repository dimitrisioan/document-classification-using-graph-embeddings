BUT
YOUR

SUCK

RUNNING
AN

ON
A
CLONE
FROM
EXPERIENCE
YOU
WOULD
BE
MUCH
BETTER
OFF
WITH
AN
XTERMINAL
IF
THIS
IS
A
NEW
INSTALL
THE
PERFORMANCE
WILL
BE
AT
LEAST
FOUR
TIMES
BETTER
IN
ADDITION
IT
WOULD
BE
MUCH
EASIER
TO
INSTALL
AND
USE
ON

OF
THAT
THEY
WILL
COST

I
THINK
YOUR
PERFORMANCE
WILL
DEPEND
UPON
THE
X
SERVER
IM
RUNNING
LINUX
AND
ON
A
WITH
OF
RAM
SWAP
AND
IT
RUNS
JUST
FINE
ITS
A
LOT
BETTER
THAN
SOME
OF
THE
CRAPPY
OLD
XTERMINALS
IN
THE
LABS
AT
SCHOOL
ANYWAY
YOU
COULD
PROBABLY
OUTFIT
A
WITH
A
MINIMAL
LINUXX
SETUP
FOR
AND
BE
BETTER
OFF
THAN
WITH
AN
XTERMINAL
