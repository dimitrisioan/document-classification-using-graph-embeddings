i
need
to
write
an
application
which
does
annotation
notes
on
existing
documents
the
annotation
could
be
done
several
times
by
different
people
the
idea
is
something
like
having
several
acetate
transparencies
stacked
on
top
of
each
other
so
that
the
user
can
see
through
all
of
them
ive
seen
something
like
this
being
done
by
the
oclock
client
could
someone
please
tell
me
how
to
do
it
in
xt
thank
you
very
much
the
oclock
widget
was
written
using
the
shape
extension
you
can
do
the
same
in
your
widgets
few
current
widgets
support
shape
so
youll
have
to
subclass
them
to
add
that
functionality
