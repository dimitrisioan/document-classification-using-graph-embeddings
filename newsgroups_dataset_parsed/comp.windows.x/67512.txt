brian
we
where
following
version
of
xv
and
i
have
been
very
surprise
to
discover
that
the
new
version
is
a
shareware
what
a
pitty
what
i
found
on
the
inthernet
was
the
freeware
i
make
myself
a
freeware
and
i
spent
long
time
on
it
but
i
dont
plain
to
make
paid
to
use
it
i
think
if
evrybody
spent
some
time
to
make
freeware
evrybody
will
be
paid
by
the
use
of
other
freeware
here
