WRITES
TWO
YEARS
AGO
I
WROTE
A
SUNVIEW
APPLICATION
FOR
FAST
ANIMATION
OF
RASTER
FILES
WITH
SUNVIEW
BECOMING
RAPIDLY
OBSELETE
IVE
FINALLY
DECIDED
TO
REWRITE
EVERYTHING
FROM
SCRATCH
IN
XVIEW
I
PUT
TOGETHER
A
QUICK
TEST
AND
IVE
FOUND
THAT
XPUTIMAGE
IS
CONSIDERABLY
SLOWER
FACTOR
OF
ON
AVERAGE
THAN
THE
SUNVIEW
COMMAND
PWROP
WHICH
MOVES
IMAGE
DATA
FROM
MEMORY
PIXRECTS
TO
A
CANVAS
THIS
WAS
ON
A
SPARC
IPX
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
X
PROTOCOL
COMMUNICATION
IS
SLOWING
THINGS
DOWN
OR
XPUTIMAGE
IS
INEFFICIENTOR
BOTH
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
THE
PROTOCOL
HAS
TO
MOVE
THE
WHOLE
IMAGE
FROM
PROCESS
MEMORY
TO
SERVER
MEMORY
THIS
IS
THE
HOG
THE
CONVERSIONS
IN
THE
XPUTIMAGE
ARE
FAST
IS
THE
FASTEST
WAY
IN
TO
DUMP
PLANE
IMAGE
DATA
TO
A
WINDOW
CAN
I
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CLIENT
IS
RUNNING
ON
THE
SAME
MACHINE
AS
THE
SERVER
OR
AM
I
STUCK
WITH
YES
BY
UTILIZING
THE
MITSHM
EXTENSION
THAT
PROVIDES
AN
XPUTIMAGE
DERIVATE
THAT
USES
SHARED
MEMORY
FINE
FAST
XPUTIMAGE
IN
WHICH
CASE
I
MIGHT
AS
WELL
GIVE
UP
NOW
NO
YOU
CAN
STILL
XPUTIMAGE
ALL
OF
THE
FRAMES
ONTO
PIXMAPS
THUS
MOVING
THEM
TO
SERVER
MEMORY
AND
THEN
REPLAY
THEM
FASTEST
USING
XCOPYAREA
BUT
BE
AWARE
THIS
IS
A
MAJOR
SERVER
MEMORY
BUMMER
