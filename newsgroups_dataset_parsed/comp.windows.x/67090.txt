cursors
according
to
the
osfmotif
style
guide
one
should
use
cursor
shapes
to
give
the
user
a
visual
clue
of
what
is
happening
or
what
is
expected
of
him
so
a
hourglass
cursor
should
be
shown
when
the
application
is
busy
or
a
caution
cursor
should
be
shown
over
an
area
when
input
is
expected
in
another
defining
cursors
for
widgets
has
to
be
done
at
rather
low
level
so
defining
a
cursor
for
all
widgets
in
an
application
but
not
for
a
certain
subpart
of
it
is
a
rather
complicated
matter
when
cursors
have
been
defined
for
some
windows
eg
a
crosswire
cursor
for
a
drawingarea
things
get
even
more
complicated
my
intuition
says
that
things
should
be
easier
but
is
this
so
if
anyone
has
a
solid
and
complete
solution
to
my
problem
please
let
me
know
the
topics
on
busy
cursors
in
the
several
faqs
are
not
helpful
since
they
only
work
for
applications
where
all
windows
have
the
cursor
window
attribute
set
to
none
