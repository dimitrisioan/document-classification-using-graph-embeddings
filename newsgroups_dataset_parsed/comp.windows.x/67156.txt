SELECTIONS
I
JUST
HAD
AN
IDEA
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
ITS
BEEN
DONE
AND
IM
JUST
REMEMBERING
IT
UNCONSIOUSLY
BUT
I
THOUGHT
THAT
IN
DIALOG
BOXES
AND
WHATEVER
IN
WINDOWING
SYSTEMS
THERE
SHOULD
BE
A
WAY
TO
INTUITIVLY
SET
SOME
THINGS
CHECKED
OR
UNCHECKED
OR
FILLED
IN
A
CERTAIN
WAY
MY
IDEA
TAPE
YOU
KNOW
LIKE
PUTTING
A
PIECE
OF
TAPE
OVER
A
LIGHT
SWITCH
JUST
AN
IDEA
IF
YOU
LIKE
IT
USE
IT
