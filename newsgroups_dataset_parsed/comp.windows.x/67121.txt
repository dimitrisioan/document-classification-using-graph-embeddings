hey
guys
i
work
on
many
stations
and
would
like
this
name
and
current
logname
to
be
in
a
title
of
xterm
when
its
open
and
a
machine
name
only
when
its
closed
in
other
words
i
want
host
and
logname
to
appear
as
a
title
of
opened
xterm
and
host
when
xterm
is
closed
how
can
i
do
it
almost
all
window
managers
twm
mwm
olwm
and
their
derivates
support
escape
sequences
for
it
for
your
purpose
put
following
into
your
login
if
youre
using
csh
or
tcsh
for
sh
you
have
to
modify
it
if
term
xterm
then
echo
endif
this
is
not
a
feature
of
the
window
manager
but
of
xterm
this
sequences
are
not
ansi
compatible
are
they
does
anyone
know
if
there
are
compatible
sequences
for
this
and
what
they
are
i
would
think
they
are
dcs
device
control
sequence
introduced
but
may
be
a
csi
sequence
exists
too
this
must
work
on
a
dxterm
vt
and
ansi
compatible
it
may
not
work
on
xterms
it
works
on
xterms
at
least
i
have
no
problem
with
it
back
to
the
original
question
i
usually
start
new
xterms
by
selecting
the
proper
menu
entry
in
my
desktop
menu
here
is
a
sample
command
xterm
sl
n
title
e
rlogin
the
n
and
title
options
give
the
text
for
window
and
icon
as
i
use
the
tcsh
a
wonderful
extension
of
the
csh
i
can
do
the
following
i
have
an
alias
precmd
echo
n
in
my
tcshrc
this
is
a
special
alias
for
tvtwm
it
is
executed
each
time
before
printing
the
prompt
so
i
have
the
current
host
name
and
the
current
directory
path
in
the
title
bar
of
my
xterms

you
gotten
an
answer
