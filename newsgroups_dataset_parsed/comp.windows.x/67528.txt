STANDARD
OUR
GROUP
IS
INTERESTED
IN
USING
A
PIXMAP
FORMAT
FOR
MULTICOLORED
ICONSBUTTONS
ETC
THAT
IS
EASILY
CONVERTED
TO
AND
FROM
OTHER
FORMAT
FROM
RESOURCE
FILES
USING
PBMPLUS
WE
CAN
EASILY
MOVE
TOFROM
XPM
TO
OUR
OTHER
ENVIRONMENTS
OF
MSWINDOWS
AND
PM
WE
WERE
WONDERING
IF
XPM
OR
SOME
OTHER
FORMAT
IS
UNDER
CONSIDERATION
TO
BE
USED
AS
A
STANDARD
BY
THE
X
CONSORTIUM
FOR
AS
WE
WOULD
PREFER
TO
USE
WHATEVER
WILL
BE
BEST
SUPPORTED
BY
X
ALONG
THE
SAME
SUBJECT
LINE
IS
THE
REASON
THE
STANDARD
X
PIXMAP
IS
NOT
USED
BECAUSE
IT
DOESNT
HAVE
AN
ASSOCIATED
COLORMAP
AND
OTHER
ATTRIBUTES
OR
IS
IT
MORE
INVOLVED
JUST
WONDERING
