WRITES
I
JUST
IMPLEMENTED
THIS
AND
IT
SEEMS
I
CAN
JUST
ABOUT
ACHIEVE
THE
DISPLAY
RATES
FRAMES
SEC
ON
IPX
THAT
I
GET
WITH
SUNVIEW
THOUGH
ITS
A
BIT
CHOPPY
AT
TIMES
ALSO
LOADING
THE
DATA
MAKING
AN
XIMAGE
THEN
XPUTING
IT
INTO
A
PIXMAP
IS
A
BIT
CUMBERSOME
SO
THE
ANIMATION
IS
SLOWER
TO
LOAD
THAN
WITH
SUNVIEW
IS
THERE
A
BETTER
WAY
TO
LOAD
IN
THE
DATA

WRITES
IF
YOU
NEED
SPEED
AND
YOUR
CLIENT
CAN
RUN
ON
THE
SAME
HOST
AS
THE
X
SERVER
YOU
SHOULD
USE
THE
SHARED
MEMORY
EXTENSION
TO
THE
SAMPLE
X
SERVER
MITSHM
XDPYINFO
WILL
TELL
YOU
IF
YOUR
SERVER
HAS
THIS
EXTENSION
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
AVAILABLE
WITH
THE
SAMPLE
MIT
X
SERVER
RUNNING
UNDER
SUNOS
A
WORD
OF
WARNING
MAKE
SURE
YOUR
KERNEL
IS
CONFIGURED
TO
SUPPORT
SHARED
MEMORY
AND
ANOTHER
WORD
OF
WARNING
OPENWINDOWS
IS
SLOWER
THAN
THE
MIT
SERVER
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
AN
IMAGING
TOOL
USING
XVIEW
FOR
THE
GUI
BY
THE
WAY
WHICH
YIELDS
OVER
FRAMES
PER
SECOND
FOR
BIT
IMAGES
RUNNING
ON
A
SPARC
IPC
HALF
THE
CPU
GRUNT
OF
AN
IPX
THIS
HAS
PROVED
QUITE
SUFFICIENT
FOR
ANIMATIONS

NICK
KISSEBERTH
LOOKS
INTERESTING
BUT
I
NEED
SOMEONE
TO
POINT
ME
TO
SOME
DOCUMENTATION
IS
THIS
METHOD
LIKELY
TO
GIVE
BETTER
RESULTS
THAN
SERVER
RESIDENT
PIXMAPS
ID
ALSO
BE
INTERESTED
IN
LOOKING
AT
THE
XVIEW
CODE
MENTIONED
ABOVE
THANKS
FOR
THE
HELP
SO
FAR
IF
I
GET
SOMETHING
DECENT
PUT
TOGETHER
ILL
DEFINITELY
POST
IT
TO
THE
NET
THE
MIT
TAPES
COME
WITH
DOCUMENTATION
WRITTEN
BY
KEITH
PACKARD
ON
THE
SHARED
MEMORY
EXTENSION
TO
X
LOOK
IN
MITDOCEXTENSIONSMITSHMMS
I
FOUND
THIS
INVALUBLE
UNFORTUNATELY
THERE
IS
A
BIT
OF
WORK
TO
SET
UP
THE
SHARED
MEMORY
SEGMENTS
MAKING
AN
XIMAGE
FROM
IT
ETC
ALSO
THERE
IS
AN
EXTENSION
QUERY
TO
DETERMINE
IF
THE
SERVER
SUPPORTS
IT
BUT
YOU
STILL
NEED
TO
TEST
IF
THE
SERVER
IS
RUNNING
ON
THE
SAME
HOST
AND
IF
SHARED
MEMORY
IS
ENABLED
IN
THE
KERNEL
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
LAYERS
OF
CONVIENCE
ROUTINES
WHICH
MAKE
ALL
THIS
TRANSPARENT
AS
FOR
THE
XVIEW
CODE
WELL
I
DOUBT
THAT
WOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
INTERESTING
THE
INTERESTING
STUFF
IS
DONE
IN
A

LIBRARY
PEOPLE
INTERESTED
IN
THIS

CAN
