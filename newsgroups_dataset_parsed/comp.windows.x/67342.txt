DOING

PRETTY

DESPITE
THE
REPEATED
MISUSE
OF

THIS
PROBABLY
TELLS
YOU
SOMETHING
ABOUT
HOW
MUCH
TO
TRUST
THE
TRADE
RAGS
IF
THEY
CANT
EVEN
GET
THE
NAME
OF
THE

SYSTEM
RIGHT
WHY
SHOULD
ONE
TRUST
ANYTHING
ELSE
THEY
HAVE
TO
SAY
I
USED
TO
THINK
THIS
WAY
AND
NOT
JUST
ABOUT
X
FOR
EXAMPLE
INCORRECT
ENGLISH
CONSTRUCTS
SUCH
AS
ITS

ID
ANNOY
ME
HOWEVER
THERE
COMES
A
TIME
WHEN
POPULAR
USAGE
STARTS
TO
DICTATE
THE
WAY
THINGS
REALLY
ARE
IN
THE
WORLD
INDEED
THE
FACT
THAT
X
WON
OUT
OVER
NEWS
WAS
REALLY
DOWN
TO
POPULAR
OPINION
I
KNOW
WE
ALL
THINK
ITS
TECHNICALLY
SUPERIOR
AS
WELL
ON
A
RELATED
TOPIC
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
COLOR
IS
MORE

LESS
CORRECT
THAN
COLOUR
BEING
IRISH
AND
HENCE
USING

ENGLISH
AS
OPPOSED
TO
AMERICAN
ENGLISH
I
ALWAYS
USE
THE
LATTER
EXCEPT
OF

FOR
API
TERMS
SUCH
AS
XALLOCCOLOR
AND
COLORMAP
IN
A
WORLD
THAT
USES
THE
TERM
WINDOWS
TO
REFER
TO
MICROSOFT
WINDOWS
PERHAPS
THE
TIME
HAS
COME
TO
ACCEPT
X
WINDOWS
AS
A
VALID
TERM
FOR
X
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
IS
A
MORE
CONCISE
AND
UNCLUTTERED
TERM
THAN
SAY
THE
X
WINDOW
SYSTEM
AND
LETS
FACE
IT
ALMOST
EVERYONE
USES
IT
ULTIMATELY
WE
ALL
NEED
PRODUCT
SALES
TO
MORE
THAN
JUST
XLITERATE
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
RESPECT
PRODUCT
RECOGNITION
IS
IMPORTANT
AND
A
SHORT
SNAPPY
DESCRIPTIVE
TITLE
X
IS
POSITIVELY
OBSCURE
WILL
HELP
WHEN
DEALING
WITH
THE
AVERAGE
PUNTER
ITS
SAD
I
THOUGHT
I
WAS
A
SOFTWARE
ENGINEER
INDEED
IT
IS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
X
DID
NOT
BECOME
POPULARLY
KNOWN
AS
WINDOWS
AND
LET
MS
WORRY
ABOUT
WHETHER
IT
SHOULD
BE
CALLED
MICROSOFT
WINDOWS
OR
THE
MICROSOFT
WINDOW
SYSTEM
OR
HOW
ABOUT
JUST
PLAIN
MICROSOFT
TO
SUMMARISE
OR
SHOULD
THAT
BE
SUMMARIZE
THE
POINT
OF
THIS
MESSAGE
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
FAR
MORE
PRESSING
ISSUES
FACING
THE
X
COMMUNITY
THAN
WORRYING
ABOUT
SUBTLE
DISTINCTIONS
IN
THE
NAMING
OF
THE
WINDOW
SYSTEM
OR
SHOULD
THAT
BE
WINDOWING
SYSTEM
WHATEVER
GETS
RECOGNISED
IS
FINE
BY
ME
I
AGREE
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
BE
CAREFUL
IN
INTERPRETING
WHAT
TRADE
PAPERS
SAY
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
BE
RELUCTANT
TO
COME
TO
THIS
CONCLUSION
PURELY
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
HOW
THEY
