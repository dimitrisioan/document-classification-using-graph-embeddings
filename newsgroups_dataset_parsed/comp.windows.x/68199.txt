mswindows
xwindows
conversion
hi
all
ive
heard
of
a
commercial
package
named
zink
that
could
convert
mswindows
sourcecode
to
xwindows
sourcecode
c
the
only
problem
is
the
package
isnt
available
in
holland
at
least
i
cant
find
it
anywhere
is
there
another
package
preferrably
free
or
shareware
that
can
do
the
same
thing
and
if
so
where
can
i
find
or
buy
it
thanks
in
