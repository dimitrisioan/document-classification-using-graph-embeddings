you
are
stuck
in
a
distributed
system
feedback
loop
what
if
you
are
on
an
xterminal
or
running
xterm
over
the
net
to
another
machine
that
is
when
the
load
problems
occur
if
you
had
a
machine
with
xterminals
attached
and
they
all
had
blinking
cursors
in
xterms
this
could
represent
a
considerable
ethernet
bandwidth
waste
ethernet
certainly
has
enough
bandwidth
for
a
few
blinking
cursors
my
lisp
machine
blinks
the
cursor
twice
a
second
and
updates
the
time
in
the
status
line
every
second
this
uses
under
bytessecond
or
about
of
the
bandwidth
of
ethernet
a
hundred
of
them
on
a
single
ethernet
might
be
a
problem
but
a
couple
dozen
should
be
fine
granted
its
nothing
to
loose
sleep
over
but
this
is
ethernets
tragic
flaw
the
more
activity
especially
lots
of
tiny
activity
the
more
collisions
happen
and
the
performance
gets
exponentially
worse
i
am
just
now
opposing
any
kind
of
waste
of
bandwidth
under
ethernet
although
in
a
polling
system
it
would
not
be
so
bad
