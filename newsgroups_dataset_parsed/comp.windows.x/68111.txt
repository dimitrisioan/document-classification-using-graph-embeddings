YES
THAT
IS
A
BUG
IN
THE
PORT
OF

YOU
SOMETIMES
GET
THIS
WHEN
YOU

I
HAVE
REPORTED
THIS
TO

BUT
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
IT
MADE
IT
INTO
HIS
SET
OF

BASICALLY
IN
MITCLIENTSXTERMMAINC
THERE
IS
A
TEST
AT
LINE
WHICH
CHECKS
ERRNO
AFTER
ATTEMPTING
TO
OPEN
DEVTTY
ADD
THE
ERRNO
EINVAL
CASE
TO
IT
AND
YOU
SHOULD
BE
FINE
ITS
ACTUALLY
A
BUG
IN
THE
SOLARIS

WE
COULD
ADD
A
WORKAROUND

I
DIDNT
HAVE
