RE
GUI
STUDY
CUTSIE
LITTLE
MACINTRASHLIKE
ICONS
THAT
ARE
AN
INSTANT
RECIPE
FOR
MOUSITIS
IMHO
SYSTEM
IS
UNDOUBTEDLY
THE
WORST
GUI
I
HAVE
USED
OUT
OF
THAT
RISCOS
MSWOMBLES
AND
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
IT
DOES
NOT
PROVIDE
ENOUGH
KEYBOARD
SHORTCUTS
WINDOWS
I
MUST
CONFESS
I
QUITE
LIKE
COVER
YOUR
EARS
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
ACTUALLY
USE
IT
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
EVER
TOUCH
THE
MOUSE
STUFF
DELETE
THE
USER
RATHER
THAN
MAKING
THINGS
EASIER
AND
THERE
SHOULD
ALWAYS
BE
THE
OPTION
TO
DO
IT
YOUR
WAY
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
WHICH
IS
WHY
I
LIKE
THE
UNIXX
COMBINATION
SO
MUCH
ITS
SO
CUSTOMIZABLE
HEAR
HEAR
I
AGREE
COMPLETELY
ONE
THING
I
CANT
STAND
ABOUT
THE
MAC
INTERFACE
IS
ITS
SHEAR
DETERMINATION
TO
FORCE
YOU
TO
USE
THE
MOUSEWHAT
IF
YOUR
MOUSE
BREAKSYOUR
WHOLE
SYSTEM
IS
DOWN
I
LIKE
THE
MOUSEIT
IS
HANDY
ON
SOME
OCCASSIONS
SUCH
AS
CUT
AND
PAST
AND
MOVING
ICONS
AROUND
ETC
BUT
FOR
MOST
WORK
THE
KEYBOARD
AND
HOT
KEYS
ARE
TIMES
FASTER
THAN
USING
THE
MOUSE
SURE
IT
IS
A
PLUS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
SOMETHING
SIMPLE
IF
YOU
ARE
AN
INEXPERIENCED
USER
BUT
HOW
LONG
IS
IT
BEFORE
YOUR
ARE
EXPERIENCED
A
MONTH
TWO
SPEAKING
OF
PCS
AT
THE
MOMENT
I
DONT
THINK
IT
IS
TOO
MUCH
TO
ASK
THAT
WINDOW
PROGRAMMERS
PROVIDE
NOT
ONLY
A
MENUMOUSE
INTERFACE
BUT
ALSO
LOOK
FORWARD
TO
THOSE
WHO
WOULD
LIKE
TO
MOVE
ON
TO
HOT
KEYS
AND
COMMAND
LINE
INTERFACES
WHICH
USUALLY
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
DO
MORE
IN
LESS
TIME
IF
YOU
ARE
EXPERIENCED
ALL
OF
THE
ABOVE
EQUALLY
APPLIES
TO
WINDOWING
SYSTEMS
ON
UNIX
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
UNIX
IS
AT
LEAST
MORE
POWERFUL
THAN
DOS
