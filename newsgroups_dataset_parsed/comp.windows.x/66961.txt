I
AM
REPOSTING
THIS
BECAUSE
I
AM
NOT
SURE
MY
FIRST
POST
EVER
MADE
IT
OUT
I
HAVE
BUILT
AND
INSTALLED
ON
MY
SPARCSTATION
MY
AIM
IS
TO
RUN
THE
MIT
X
SERVER
BUT
RETAIN
THE
OPENLOOK
WINDOW
MANAGER
I
AM
SURE
THIS
IS
NOT
UNCOMMON
BUT
I
JUST
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
I
CHANGE
ANDOR
DELETE
EVERYTHING
THAT
I
NEED
TO
FOR
INSTANCE
I
CAN
START
XDM
IN
RCLOCAL
BUT
HOW
DO
I
GET
RID
OF
XNEWS
THE
OPENLOOK
WINDOW
MANAGER
SOURCE
IS
AVAILABLE
ON
THE
MIT
CONTRIB
TAPES
OR
FROM
EXPORTLCSMITEDU
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
BUILDING
THIS
TOO
RATHER
THAN
USING
THE
VERSION
FROM
OPENWINDOWS
IT
IS
OLWM
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
SKIPPING
OLWM
AND
GETTING
OLVWM
INSTEAD
THIS
VERSION
OF
THE
OLWM
WINDOW
MANAGER
IMPLEMENTS
A
VIRTUAL
DESKTOP
THAT
I
FIND
REALLY
HANDY
EVEN
ON
LARGE
MONITORS
THIS
VERSION
IS
ALSO
AVAILABLE
AT
THE
README
FILE
ALSO
SUGGEST
GETTING
THE
FILES
IN
IN
MY
CASE
I
BUILT
THE
X
SERVER
FIRST
XVIEW
SECOND
THEN
OLVWM
ALL
OF
THESE
WERE
INSTALLED
INTO
ONCE
I
VERIFIED
THE
SERVER
WORKED
CORRECTLY
I
HAPPILY
ISSUED
RM
RF
USROPENWIN
USING
GCC
TO
BUILD
ALL
OF
THE
ABOVE
RESULTED
IN
A
WINDOWING
SYSTEM
THAT
IS
FOR
ALL
INTENTS
AND
PURPOSES
IDENTICAL
TO
OPENWINDOWS
AND
THAT
IS
INCREDIBLY
FASTER
THERE
IS
A
BIT
OF
TWEAKING
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
DO
IF
YOU
WANT
THINGS
TO
WORK
EXACTLY
LIKE
OPENWINDOWS
BUT
NOT
MUCH
