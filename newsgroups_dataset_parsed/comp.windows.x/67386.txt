what
sort
of
traffic
is
generated
with
the
xcalls
i
am
curious
to
find
out
the
required
bandwidth
that
a
link
must
have
if
one
machine
running
dvx
is
supporting
multiple
users
clients
and
we
require
adequate
response
time
anyone
have
any
ideas
i
expect
the
limiting
factor
will
be
your
server
machine
not
the
network
itself
to
give
you
a
realworld
example
here
at
quarterdeck
we
have
roughly
people
using
dvx
to
talk
to
a
bunch
of
unix
boxes
novell
file
servers
and
each
other
its
not
too
much
of
a
load
on
our
ethernet
with
maybe
concentrators
so
you
have
people
on
each
segment
if
you
had
a
badly
loaded
net
or
the
apps
you
wanted
to
run
were
very
network
intensive
you
could
run
into
some
slowdowns
but
the
biggest
problem
would
be
the
machine
itself
say
you
have
a
with
plenty
of
ram
and
a
fast
hard
disk
and
network
card
if
you
have
people
running
programs
off
it
youre
going
to
see
some
slowdowns
because
youre
now
on
effectively
a
mhz
of
course
dvx
will
attempt
to
see
if
tasks
are
idle
and
make
sure
they
give
up
their
time
slice
but
if
you
have
working
programs
running
youll
know
it
well
i
can
buy
a
bigger
and
more
powerful
server
machine
because
of
the
significant
drop
in
price
year
after
year
the
link
i
want
to
use
though
isdn
is
costly
and
the
bandwidth
limited
thats
why
my
interest
lies
in
seeing
if
such
a
link
can
be
used
and
see
what
traffic
goes
through
it
having
said
that
if
you
can
tweak
the
programs
being
run
by
adding
in
calls
to
give
up
time
slices
when
idle
and
that
sort
of
thing
you
could
probably
run
people
on
a
given
machine
before
you
started
seeing
slowdowns
again
this
time
from
network
bandwidth
hmmm
has
anyone
at
your
centre
monitored
the
traffic
at
all
are
you
running
any
standard
mswindows
programs
like
word
what
sort
of
packets
go
blazing
through
what
size
link
do
you
have
or
what
is
the
average
traffic
flow
going
through
your
network
or
do
you
have
few
high
peaks
and
then
many
low
points
it
all
really
depends
on
what
the
programs
are
doing
ie
youre
going
to
see
a
slowdown
from
xbandwidth
a
lot
sooner
if
your
apps
are
all
doing
network
things
also
what
do
you
mean
by
network
things
i
vision
using
ms
windows
and
other
windows
applications
over
the
network
were
the
processes
are
running
on
the
server
and
all
i
am
getting
are
the
displays
i
am
wondering
how
good
is
the
x
and
subsequently
dvx
protocol
in
transferring
these
images
with
xcalls
and
displaying
them
on
a
clients
machine
