x
server
only
on
sun
i
have
been
using
a
hds
xterminal
and
really
like
it
what
is
really
powerful
is
that
it
can
run
the
x
server
without
running
a
window
manager
one
can
then
run
a
special
client
x
program
called
a
window
manager
either
run
motif
or
openlook
from
its
own
firmware
limiting
the
network
traffic
but
having
no
home
or
run
motif
or
openlook
from
some
home
place
like
a
sparc
or
vms
this
is
powerful
especially
since
i
can
exit
one
window
manager
without
killing
windows
and
then
start
up
another
manager
some
of
my
vms
tools
need
special
metamouse
combos
that
work
in
one
manager
and
not
the
other
well
the
question
is
on
a
sparcstation
running
openlook
does
anyone
know
how
to
break
apart
olwm
from
the
olwmslave
program
basically
i
want
to
run
only
the
server
and
go
somewhere
else
to
run
the
window
manager
please
respond
my
email
as
well
as
posting
because
of
the
large
volumes
in
windowx
thanks
