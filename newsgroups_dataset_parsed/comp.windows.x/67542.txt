SERVER
ONLY
ON
SUN
I
HAVE
BEEN
USING
A
HDS
XTERMINAL
AND
REALLY
LIKE
IT
WHAT
IS
REALLY
POWERFUL
IS
THAT
IT
CAN
RUN
THE
X
SERVER
WITHOUT
RUNNING
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
ONE
CAN
THEN
RUN
A
SPECIAL
CLIENT
X
PROGRAM
CALLED
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
EITHER
RUN
MOTIF
OR
OPENLOOK
FROM
ITS
OWN
FIRMWARE
LIMITING
THE
NETWORK
TRAFFIC
BUT
HAVING
NO
HOME
OR
RUN
MOTIF
OR
OPENLOOK
FROM
SOME
HOME
PLACE
LIKE
A
SPARC
OR
VMS
THIS
IS
POWERFUL
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
I
CAN
EXIT
ONE
WINDOW
MANAGER
WITHOUT
KILLING
WINDOWS
AND
THEN
START
UP
ANOTHER
MANAGER
