KEYBOARD
FOCUSSING

HAVE
TWO
MOTIF
WIDGETS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
CONTROL
ONE
OF
THEM
VIA
THE
KEYBOARD

THE
OTHER
WITH
THE
MOUSE
I
SET
THE
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
ON
THE
FIRST
WIDGET
BUT
AS
SOON
AS
I
CLICK
THE
MOUSE
ON
THE
SECOND
ONE
I
LOSE
THE
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
ON
THE
FIRST
ONE
COULD
SOME
KIND
SOUL
SHOW
ME
HOW
TO
DO
THIS
