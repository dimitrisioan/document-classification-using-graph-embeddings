ANNOUNCING
TCPVIEW
A
MOTIFBASED
TCPIP
PROTOCOL
ANALYZER
TCPVIEW
IS
THE
RESULT
OF
SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
WE
HAD
AT
UW
WE
HAVE
SEVERAL
NETWORK
GENERAL
SNIFFERS
WHICH
ARE
HEAVILY
USED
TO
HELP
DEBUG
PROBLEMS
ON
SEVERAL
HUNDRED
SUBNETS
THESE
ARE
GOOD
TOOLS
BUT
THEY
ARE
HEAVY
HARD
TO
FIND
WHEN
YOU
NEED
ONE
LIMITED

EXPANDIBILITY
DIFFICULT

WE
ALSO
SOMETIMES
USE
TCPDUMP
BUT
WE
FOUND
IT
TOO
DIFFICULT
FOR
MOST
PEOPLE
DID
NOT
HAVE
ENOUGH
INFORMATION
FOR
MANY
PROTOCOLS
COULD
NOT
BE
USED
INTERACTIVELY
COULD
NOT
HANDLE
TCP
STREAMS
AND
COULD
NOT
READ
SNIFFER
FILES
HOWEVER
TCPDUMP
DID
DO
A
REASONABLE
JOB
OF
DECODING
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PROTOCOLS
AND
COULD
BE
EASILY
MODIFIED
TCPVIEW
IS
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
RESOLVE
THESE
PROBLEMS
BY
ADDING
A
MOTIF
INTERFACE
TO
TCPDUMP
AND
EXPANDING
ITS
FEATURES
TCPVIEW
HAS
BEEN
TESTED
ON
A
DECSTATION
AND
SUN
UNDER
ULTRIX
AND
SUNOS
RESPECTIVELY
IT
SHOULD
WORK
ON
THE
SAME
SYSTEMS
AS
TCPDUMP
IT
COMPILES
WITH
CC
AND
GCC
ON
THE
DEC
