HI

DOES
ANYBODY

IS
SOMETHING
LIKE
MACINTOSH
HYPERCARD

ANY
UNIX
PLATFORM

SEVERAL

PER
SEAT
AND

HARDWARE
GAIN
MOMENTUM
MIGHT
BE
A
GOOD
CHOICE
IT
ISNT
COMPATIBLE
WITH
HYPERCARD
BUT
HAS
A
SIMILAR
ARCHITECTURE
AND
WAY
MORE
FUNCTIONALITY
I
DONT
HAVE
CONTACT

WERE
RECENTLY
PURCHASED
BY
SYBASE
WHO
SHOULDNT
BE
TOO
HARD
TO
FIND
IF
YOURE
RUNNING
NEWS
ON
SPARC
CHECK
OUT
HYPERLOOK
HYPERLOOKTURINGCOM
IT
USES
POSTSCRIPT
AS
A
SCRIPTING
LANGUAGE
WHICH
IS
GOOD
IF
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
LOTS
OF
DISPLAY
ORIENTED
SCRIPTING
BUT
NOT
SO
GOOD
FOR
NONPROGRAMMERS

LAST

ALPHATESTING
DIRECT
IMPORTING
OF
HYPERCARD
STACKS

THE
