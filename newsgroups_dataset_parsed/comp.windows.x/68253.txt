bernward
averwald
back
in
the
days
of
i
did
analyse
the
xterm
code
the
cursor
was
implemented
by
drawing
a
rectangle
around
the
character
i
doesnt
seem
to
be
changed
til
now
but
if
you
have
the
sources
you
could
add
a
blinking
cursor
via
xtappaddtimeout
or
similar
the
server
overhead
for
this
is
mildly
ridiculous
though
see
also
desqviewx
which
does
this
in
its
dos
windows
do
you
really
want
xterm
to
wake
up
every
half
second
and
whack
the
server
into
doing
a
bitblt
so
what
im
running
emu
on
a
mhz
box
i
cannot
make
out
any
difference
in
performance
whether
the
cursor
is
set
to
blinking
or
not
if
you
think
about
it
a
bit
a
cycle
of
ms
is
a
hell
a
lot
of
time
for
even
the
slowest
pc
since
you
would
of
course
only
enable
the
blinking
text
cursor
when
your
xterm
has
the
input
focus
this
application
is
active
anyway
to
repeat
it
a
blinking
text
cursor
costs
almost
nothing
in
performance
it
just
needs
some
thought
when
designing
the
xterm
software
you
are
stuck
in
a
distributed
system
feedback
loop
what
if
you
are
on
an
xterminal
or
running
xterm
over
the
net
to
another
machine
that
is
when
the
load
problems
occur
if
you
had
a
machine
with
xterminals
attached
and
they
all
had
blinking
cursors
in
xterms
this
could
represent
a
considerable
ethernet
bandwidth
waste
im
not
picking
on
you
just
people
keep
forgetting
that
there
is
a
lot
of
life
out
there
besides
distributed
or
singleuser
workstations
