TRY
THIS
AFTER
XCREATEWINDOW
XSIZEHINTSFLAGS
USPOSITION
USSIZE
OR
PPOSITION
PSIZE
XSETWMNORMALHINTS
DISPLAY
WINDOW
XSIZEHINTS
THESE
HINTS
TELL
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
THAT
THE
POSITION
AND
SIZE
OF
THE
WINDOW
ARE
SPECIFIED
BY
THE
USERS
AND
THAT
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
SHOULD
ACCEPT
THESE
VALUES
IF
YOU
USE
XSIZEHINTSFLAGS
PPOSITION
PSIZE
THIS
TELLS
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
THAT
THE
VALUES
ARE
PREFERED
VALUES
OF
THE
PROGRAM
NOT
THE
USER
I
DONT
KNOW
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
THAT
DOESNT
PLACE
THE
WINDOW
LIKE
YOU
PREFER
IF
YOU
SPECIFY
THE
POSITION
AND
SIZE
LIKE
ABOVE
SORRY
BUT
OLWM
AND
TVTWM
DONT
DO
IT
THEY
PLACE
THE
TITLE
AT
THAT
POSITION
AND
THE
WINDOW
AT
A
POSITION
BELOW
IT
THE
REASON
THEY
PLACE
THEIR
OUTSIDE
CORNER
AT
THE
LOCATION
YOU
REQUESTED
IS
BECAUSE
THATS
WHAT
THE
ICCCM
SAYS
THEY
SHOULD
DO
THIS
BECOMES
A
PROBLEM
WHEN
YOU
WANT
A
PROGRAM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SAVE
ITS
CURRENT
CONFIGURATION
AND
RESTORE
IS
LATER
CURRENTLY
MY
SOLUTION
IS
XCREATEWINDOW
XSETWMPROPERTIES
XMAPWINDOW
XFLUSH
XMOVEWINDOW
THIS
CODE
WILL
ALMOST
CERTAINLY
BREAK
CALLING
XMAPWINDOW
AND
THEN
XFLUSH
DOES
NOT
GUARANTEE
THAT
THE
WINDOW
IS
VISIBLE
AND
MANAGED
BY
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
EVEN
IF
THIS
DID
WORK
THERE
ISNT
A
RELIABLE
WAY
TO
FIND
OUT
HOW
MUCH
DECORATION
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
PLACED
AROUND
YOUR
WINDOW
SO
YOU
DONT
KNOW
HOW
FAR
TO
MOVE
IT
AND
WHAT
IF
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
REFUSES
TO
MOVE
YOUR
WINDOW
