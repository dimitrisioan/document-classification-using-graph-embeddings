DAVID
YOUNG
WRITES
I
HAVE
AN
APPLICATIONSHELL
WHICH
USES
A
COLORMAP
CREATED
WITH
XCREATECOLORMAP
AND
USES
ALL
OF
THE
COLORS
AVAILABLE
FOR
MY
DISPLAYWHEN
I
POPUP
A
DIALOGSHELL
TO
PROMPT
THE
USER
FOR
SOME
INPUT
I
WANT
THE
XMNDIALOGSTYLE
TO
BE
SET
TO
XMDIALOGPRIMARYAPPLICATIONMODAL
THE
RESULT
IS
THAT
IF
MY
CURSOR
IS
OVER
THE
DIALOGSHELL
I
GET
MY
COLORMAP
BUT
IF
THE
CURSOR
IS
OVER
THE
APPLICATIONSHELL
OR
ANY
WINDOW
OTHER
THAN
THE
DIALOGSHELL
I
GET
THE
DEFAULT
COLORMAP
BUT
ID
LIKE
IT
SO
THAT
IF
MY
CURSOR
IS
OVER
ANY
WINDOW
OF
MY
APPLICATION
I
GET
MY
COLORMAP
I
THINK
THIS
IS
CORRECT
BEHAVIOR
REMEMBER
THE
DEFAULT
COLORMAPFOCUSPOLICY
IS
KEYBOARD
MEANING
THE
CMAP
FOCUS
FOLLOWS
THE
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
SINCE
THE
DIALOG
IS
MODAL
MWM
WONT
ALLOW
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
ONTO
YOUR
MAIN
SHELL
AND
SO
IT
WONT
ALLOW
CMAP
FOCUS
EITHER
SINCE
IT
SOUNDS
AS
THOUGH
YOU
HAVE
KEYBOARDFOCUSPOLICYPOINTER
I
SUGGEST
YOU
SET
COLORMAPFOCUSPOLICYPOINTER
ALSO
THAT
WAY
THE
CMAP
FOCUS
WONT
SLAVISHLY
FOLLOW
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
BUT
WILL
BEAT
ITS
OWN
PATH
IF
YOU
HAVE
KEYBOARDFOCUSPOLICY
EXPLICIT
YOU
CAN
SET
CMAP
FOCUS
EXPLICIT
ALSO
BUT
YOU
THEN
NEED
A
BINDING
TO
FFOCUSCOLOR
PROBABLY
ON
