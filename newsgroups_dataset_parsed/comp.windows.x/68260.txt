we
have
a
problem
with
makedepend
it
doesnt
know
how
to
correctly
process
if
clause
in
c
preprocessor
statements
it
evaluates
everything
to
true
no

what
the
conditionals
are
has
anybody
come
up
with
some
solutionfix
to
makdepend
other
than
writeyourownparser
and
willing
to
share
it
with
us
rewrite
makedepend
to
use
cc
m
or
gcc
m
or
gcc
mm
which
is
the
one
i
prefer
since
system
headers
dont
change
that
often
for
generating
the
actual
dependencies
youll
still
need
to
write
the
parts
that
edit
the
actual
makefile
i
think
theres
a
program
in
the
berkeley
distributions
called
mkdep
that
will
do
essentially
