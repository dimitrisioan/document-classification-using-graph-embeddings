i
know
it
sounds
stupid
but
ik
does
anyone
know
how
to
control
individual
mouse
buttons
ik
i
am
writing
an
application
which
currently
makes
use
of
ik
buttonpressmask
however
this
is
invoked
by
the
pressing
ik
of
any
mouse
button
i
want
to
be
able
to
restrict
this
ik
to
one
of
the
buttons
i
tried
but
ik
just
get
undefined
errors
i
know
it
can
be
done
and
i
ik
am
pretty
sure
theres
an
easy
answer
to
it
but
i
just
dont
know
ik
what
it
is
ik
time
is
of
the
essence
there
is
no
event
mask
for
a
particular
mouse
button
press
however
in
your
event
handler
you
can
use
the
event
structure
passed
in
and
query
it
to
find
which
button
was
pressed
ie
void
someeventhandlerwidget
w
xtpointer
data
xevent
event
catch
the
button
usually
left
button
if
eventxbuttonbutton
do
some
action
else
do
nothing
and
exit
from
function
