STANDARD
COLORMAPS
IM
WORKING
ON
AN
APPLICATION
AND
HAVE
CONCERNS
REGARDING
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
THE
DOCUMENTATION
SAYS
USUALLY
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
CREATES
THESE
COLORMAPS
I
WONDER
WHAT
WINDOW
MANAGER
THE
WRITER
HAD
IN
MIND
NEITHER
TWM
OR
MWM
SEEM
TO
CREATE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
OF
COURSE
ONE
CAN
USE
XSTDCMAP
TO
CREATE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
HOWEVER
XSTDCMAP
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
TRY
VERY
HARD
TO
AVOID
CONFLICTS
WITH
THE
DEFAULT
COLORMAP
WHEN
I
USE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
CREATED
BY
XSTDCMAP
THE
REST
OF
MY
DISPLAY
GOES
BLACK
SO
IT
SEEMS
AS
IF
USE
OF
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
CAUSES
THE
VERY
PROBLEM
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
ARE
INTENDED
TO
AVOID
PERHAPS
IF
EVERY
APPLICATION
USED
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
THINGS
WOULD
BE
WONDERFUL
BUT
NOT
MANY
APPLICATIONS
SEEM
TO
USE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
FINALLY
THE
OPERATION
OF
THE
FUNCTIONS
XMUGETCOLORMAPALLOCATION
XMUSTANDARDCOLORMAP
AND
XMUCREATECOLORMAP
SEEM
INCONSISTENT
