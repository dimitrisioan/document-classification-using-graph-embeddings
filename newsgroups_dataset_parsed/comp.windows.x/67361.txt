standard
colormaps
im
working
on
an
application
and
have
concerns
regarding
standard
colormaps
the
documentation
says
usually
a
window
manager
creates
these
colormaps
i
wonder
what
window
manager
the
writer
had
in
mind
neither
twm
or
mwm
seem
to
create
standard
colormaps
of
course
one
can
use
xstdcmap
to
create
standard
colormaps
however
xstdcmap
doesnt
seem
to
try
very
hard
to
avoid
conflicts
with
the
default
colormap
when
i
use
standard
colormaps
created
by
xstdcmap
the
rest
of
my
display
goes
black
so
it
seems
as
if
use
of
standard
colormaps
causes
the
very
problem
standard
colormaps
are
intended
to
avoid
perhaps
if
every
application
used
standard
colormaps
things
would
be
wonderful
but
not
many
applications
seem
to
use
standard
colormaps
finally
the
operation
of
the
functions
xmugetcolormapallocation
xmustandardcolormap
and
xmucreatecolormap
seem
inconsistent
with
the
section
of
the
xlib
documentation
according
to
the
section
of
the
xlib
documentation
p
for
grayscale
colormaps
only
the
colormap
redmax
redmult
and
basepixel
members
are
defined
the
other
members
are
ignored
to
compute
a
grayscale
pixel
value
use
the
following
expression
gray
redmult
basepixel
xmugetcolormapallocation
defined
in
mitlibxmucmapallocc
is
used
by
xmulookupstandardcolormap
defined
in
mitlibxmulookupcmapc
to
select
redmax
greenmax
and
bluemax
values
for
the
call
to
xmustandardcolormap
when
the
rgbgraymap
property
is
specified
xmugetcolormapallocation
sets
redmax
to
of
the
total
number
of
cells
in
the
gray
scale
sets
greenmax
to
of
the
total
number
and
sets
bluemax
ot
of
the
total
number
referring
to
section
one
would
expect
xmugetcolormapallocation
to
set
redmax
to
the
total
number
of
cells
in
the
gray
scale
when
the
rgbgraymap
property
is
specified
xmustandardcolormap
defined
in
mitlibxmustdcmapc
sets
redmult
greenmult
and
bluemult
all
equal
to
referring
to
section
one
would
expect
greenmult
and
bluemult
to
be
ignored
when
redmult
greenmult
and
bluemult
all
equal
xmucreatecolormap
defined
in
mitlibxmucrcmapc
constructs
a
gray
map
the
sum
of
redmax
greenmax
and
bluemax
gives
the
maximum
gray
value
referring
to
section
on
would
expect
redmax
to
give
the
maximum
gray
value
