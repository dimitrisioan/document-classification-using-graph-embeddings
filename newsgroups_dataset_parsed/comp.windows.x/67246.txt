WRITES
THE
APPLICATION
CREATES
WINDOW
WITH
A
BUTTON
QUIT
AND
PRESS
ME
THE
BUTTON
PRESS
ME
POPS
UP
A
DIALOG
BOX
THE
STRANGE
FEATURE
OF
THIS
PROGRAM
IS
THAT
IT
ALWAYS
POPS
UP
THE
DIALOG
BOX
MUCH
FASTER
THE
FIRST
TIME
IF
I
TRY
TO
POP
IT
UP
A
TIME
TIME
IT
IS
MUCH
SLOWER
THE
SHELL
IS
WAITING
FOR
THE
WINDOWMANAGER
TO
RESPOND
TO
ITS
POSITIONING
REQUEST
THE
WINDOWMANAGER
IS
NOT
RESPONDING
BECAUSE
IT
THINKS
THE
WINDOW
IS
ALREADY
IN
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
EXACTLY
WHY
THE
TWO
COMPONENTS
GET
INTO
THIS
SULK
IS
UNCLEAR
TO
ME
ALL
INFORMATION
GREATLY
RECEIVED
THANKS
FOR
THIS
CLUE
AND
THANKS
TO
DEREK
HO
ALSO
FOR
A
POINTER
IN
THE
SAME
DIRECTION
ONE
SOLUTION
DUE
TO
DEREK
HO
WHEN
THE
POPUP
IS
POPPED
UP
WE
SETVALUE
ITS
LOCATION
WHICH
ON
REPEAT
POPUPS
WILL
BE
UNCHANGED
FROM
THE
PREVIOUS
POPUP
THE
SLOW
RESPONSE
CAN
BE
AVOIDED
BY
CALLING
GETVALUE
FIRST
AND
ONLY
USING
SETVALUE
IF
THE
REQUIRED
LOCATION
IS
DIFFERENT
THE
PROBLEM
CAN
ALSO
BE
AVOIDED
BY
MAKING
A
TINY
ALTERATION
IN
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
POPUP
SO
THAT
THE
SETVALUE
REALLY
DOES
CHANGE
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
POPUP
WE
TRIED
THIS
JUST
FOR
A
DOUBLE
CHECK
ON
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
THE
SOLUTIONS
WE
HAVE
TRIED
SUCCESSFULLY
ARE
NOW
AS
FOLLOWS
USE
TWM
OR
MWM
RATHER
THAN
OLWM
USE
OLWM
WITH
RESOURCE
WMTIMEOUT
ONLY
RESET
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
POPUP
WINDOW
IF
IT
IS
TRUELY
CHANGED
THIS
IS
OBVIOUSLY
WORKING
AROUND
SOME
BUG
SOMEWHERE
