problems
i
dont
seem
to
be
able
to
get
window
positions
reliably
through
the
xview
xvget
function
x
int
xvgetmyframe
xvx
y
int
xvgetmyframe
xvy
for
example
if
i
set
xvx
xvy
to
the
frame
comes
up
in
the
correct
position
with
the
top
left
corner
the
size
handle
at
xvget
returns
as
well
but
later
on
xvget
returns
without
any
intervening
xvsetmyframe
xv
my
frame
is
fitted
around
a
canvas
and
it
turns
out
by
measuring
on
the
screen
that
is
the
position
of
the
first
pixel
in
my
canvas
relative
to
the
frames
origin
what
gives
any
help
most
appreciated
derek
ps
on
a
related
subject
is
there
any
way
of
querying
the
window
manager
as
to
the
thickness
of
borders
it
puts
around
frames
etc
