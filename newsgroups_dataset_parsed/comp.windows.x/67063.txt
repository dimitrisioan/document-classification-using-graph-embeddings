gcc
and
building
the
hp
widget
set
on
linux
i
am
currently
attempting
to
get
a
copy
of
the
hp
widget
set
compiled
under
linux
sls
release
with
kernel
and
am
running
into
some
problems
actually
it
seems
that
this
is
more
of
a
gcc
question
because
i
got
it
to
compile
without
trouble
using
cc
on
an
basically
there
are
a
number
of
functions
with
prototypes
set
up
in
lets
say
compositeph
for
instance
the
composite
widgets
insertchild
procedure
is
set
up
with
the
type
typedef
void
xtwidgetproc
widget
but
in
several
places
in
the
hp
source
code
they
reference
the
insertchild
procedure
and
pass
it
multiple
arguments
instead
of
just
one
as
the
prototype
suggests
for
example
superclasscompositeclassinsertchildw
args
pnumargs
now
gcc
chokes
on
this
giving
an
error
message
that
too
many
arguments
are
passed
to
the
function
so
does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
as
to
how
to
turn
off
this
checking
in
gcc
or
how
i
can
go
about
changing
the
code
to
accomodate
this
call
without
changing
or
has
anyone
successfully
built
the
hp
widget
set
and
have
any
suggestions
many
thanks
in
advance
for
any
help
