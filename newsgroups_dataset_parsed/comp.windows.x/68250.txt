OW
IS
THE
SAME
BUT
THE
DEFINITION
OF
BROKEN
IS
RELATIVE
PAGEVIEW
REQUIRES
DSC
COMPLIANT
POSTSCRIPT
FILES
IN
ORDER
TO
STOP
AT
PAGE
BREAKS
I
DONT
CONSIDER
THAT
BROKEN
I
SAY
THAT
ANY
PROGRAM
THAT
PUTS
OUT
A
POSTSCRIPT
FILE
THAT
ISNT
DSC
COMPLIANT
IS
BROKEN
WELL
THAT
MAY
BE
TRUE
HOWEVER
THE
MAN
PAGE
FOR
PAGEVIEW
FOR
OW
DOES
NOT
MENTION
ABOUT
DSC
COMPLIANCE
IN
ANY
EVENT
THE
POINT
HERE
IS
THAT
IF
YOU
TRY
TO
DISPLAY
SOME
PS
FILES
USING
PAGEVIEW
YOU
WILL
FIND
OUT
THAT
ITS
NOT
A
PRACTICAL
TOOL
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
THE
MAN
PAGE
FOR
PAGEVIEW
DOES
NOT
SAY
THAT
THE
FILES
NEED
TO
BE
DSC
COMPLIANT
THAT
IS
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
LEFT
HAND
NOT
KNOWING
WHAT
THE
RIGHT
HAND
IS
DOING
AT
SUN
I
WAS
INFORMED
BY
A
SUN
EMPLOYEE
THAT
THE
PAGEVIEW
PROGRAM
DOES
REQUIRE
DSC
COMPLIANT
POSTSCRIPT
THERE
WAS
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
IT
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
CHANGED
SO
THAT
IF
THE
FILE
WASNT
DSC
COMPLIANT
THAT
IT
WOULD
STOP
AT
EACH
SHOWPAGE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
METHOD
WOULD
PRECLUDE
BEING
ABLE
TO
GO
BACKWARDS
AND
FORWARDS
THROUGH
THE
FILE
IE
YOU
COULD
ONLY
GO
FORWARD
TO
THE
NEXT
SHOWPAGE
THIS
ISNT
IN
PAGEVIEW
BUT
MAYBE
IT
IS
IN
THE
SOLARIS
VERSION
OF
OW
OW
IN
ANY
EVENT
I
FIND
PAGEVIEW
EXTREMELY
USEFUL
SINCE
ALL
OF
THE
POSTSCRIPT
THAT
I
PRODUCE
IS
DSC
COMPLIANT
I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
PROBLEMS
