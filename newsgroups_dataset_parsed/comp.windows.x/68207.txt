xclients
wont
work
under
repost
when
i
changed
from
to
on
my
intel
box
i
discovered
that
some
of
my
xclients
such
as
xload
etc
would
no
longer
work
they
bomb
out
with
the
message
error
cant
open
display
is
this
because
they
cant
find
the
correct
shared
libraries
they
need
to
be
recompiled
or
have
i
not
used
the
correct
options
both
systems
use
thanks
