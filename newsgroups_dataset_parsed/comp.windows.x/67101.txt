some
one
asked
me
recently
why
they
when
they
used
xquerybestcursor
to
see
if
they
could
create
of
a
given
size
it
seemed
to
imply
they
could
but
the
server
did
not
create
cursors
of
that
size
investigation
showed
that
some
x
servers
will
happily
return
any
size
up
to
the
size
of
the
root
window
while
others
return
some
fixed
limit
of
more
reasonable
size
the
interesting
thing
to
me
is
that
the
same
server
binary
acts
differently
on
different
hardware
a
with
a
will
claim
cursors
up
to
root
window
size
are
ok
while
a
with
a
will
stop
at
so
far
ive
also
seen
this
behavior
on
ncd
and
phasex
x
terminals
and
have
been
told
it
also
occurs
on
hps
actually
the
ncd
is
even
more
liberal
sizes
much
larger
then
the
root
winodw
are
gladly
returned
as
ok
is
xquerybestcursor
semibroken
or
is
this
behavior
correct
id
really
like
to
see
a
cursor
