XQUERYBESTCURSOR
SEMIBROKEN
SOME
ONE
ASKED
ME
RECENTLY
WHY
THEY
WHEN
THEY
USED
XQUERYBESTCURSOR
TO
SEE
IF
THEY
COULD
CREATE
OF
A
GIVEN
SIZE
IT
SEEMED
TO
IMPLY
THEY
COULD
BUT
THE
SERVER
DID
NOT
CREATE
CURSORS
OF
THAT
SIZE
INVESTIGATION
SHOWED
THAT
SOME
X
SERVERS
WILL
HAPPILY
RETURN
ANY
SIZE
UP
TO
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
ROOT
WINDOW
WHILE
OTHERS
RETURN
SOME
FIXED
LIMIT
OF
MORE
REASONABLE
SIZE
THE
INTERESTING
THING
TO
ME
IS
THAT
THE
SAME
SERVER
BINARY
ACTS
DIFFERENTLY
ON
DIFFERENT
HARDWARE
A
WITH
A
WILL
CLAIM
CURSORS
UP
TO
ROOT
WINDOW

OK

A
WITH
A
WILL
STOP

SO
FAR
