XV
IS
SHAREWARE
FOR
PERSONAL
USE
ONLY
YOU
MAY
USE
XV
FOR
YOUR
OWN
WHAT
DOES
THIS
MEAN
ANYWAY
CAN
I
SIT
IN
A
COMPANY
AND
LOOK
AT
PICTURES
OFF
THE
NET
IN
MY
SPARE
TIME
AMUSEMENT
AND
IF
YOU
FIND
IT
NIFTY
USEFUL
GENERALLY
COOL
OR
OF
SOME
VALUE
TO
YOU
YOUR
NONDEDUCTABLE

DID
THE

GET
PERMISSION

DID
THE

ALSO
GET
PERMISSION
FROM
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
XV
TO
SELL
THEIR

AS
WELL
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
NOW
NOBODY
IS
GOING
TO
WANT
TO
HELP
THE
AUTHOR
MAINTAIN
THE
CODE
ANYMORE
NOW
THAT
XV
HAS
BECOME
A
COMMERCIAL
PRODUCT
AND
SUPPORT
FOR
XV
WILL
BEGIN
TO
SLIDE
DOWNHILL
IF
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
THEN
THATS
A
BUMMER
I
REALLY
LIKED
