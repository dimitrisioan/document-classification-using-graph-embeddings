vs
configure
event
handling
repost
i
have
two
questions
well
probably
more
about
how
expose
configure
events
are
handled
i
have
an
appl
which
uses
window
to
draw
in
since
i
give
the
user
the
capability
of
scaling
and
zooming
as
well
as
allowing
the
window
to
be
resized
i
made
a
translation
table
for
the
expose
configure
events
the
expose
event
calls
my
redraw
method
while
the
configure
event
calls
my
rescale
method
the
rescale
method
invokes
a
fake
expose
event
actually
just
calls
the
redraw
w
an
appropriate
expose
struct
to
draw
the
data
quest
when
the
appl
is
compiledlinked
w
running
in
either
or
env
i
get
multiple
redraws
when
the
window
gets
uncovered
or
the
size
is
changed
i
assume
im
getting
cascading
events
is
that
right
any
suggestions
as
to
how
to
handletrap
events
in
a
better
way
quest
when
the
appl
is
compiledlinked
w
i
get
no
expose
events
whatsoever
do
events
andor
translation
tables
act
differently
in
thanks
in
advance
