DYNAMIC

CONFIGURATION
IN
TWM
I
CONSIDER
TWMSTYLE
SQUEEZED
TITLES
INDISPENSABLE
IN
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
I
LIKE
TO
HAVE
TWO
TALL
XTERM
WINDOWS
VISIBLE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
WITH
NO
OVERLAP
AND
SINCE
TWO
WINDOWS
ARENT
ENOUGH
I
HAVE
OTHER
XTERM
WINDOWS
UNDERNEATH
THEM
WITH
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
POSITIONING
IN
CASE
YOURE
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
SQUEEZED
TITLES
HERES

THIS
IS

BUT
BODY
OF
THE
YOU
CAN
STILL
SEE
CS
TITLE
WINDOW
WINDOW
A
WHICH
IS
SQUEEZED
RIGHT
FIGURE
SQUEEZED
TITLES
ALLOW
ME
TO
HAVE
ABOUT
SUCH
WINDOWS
IN
EACH
STACK
WITH
EASY
ACCESS
AND
PER
STACK
IS
USUALLY
MORE
THAN
I
REALLY
NEED
SINCE
I
ALSO
INSIST
ON
HAVING
A
VIRTUAL
WM
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
TITLE
LOCATION
IS
STATIC
THAT
IS
IT
IS
CONFIGURED
IN
TWMRC
AND
IN
ORDER
TO
CHANGE
IT
YOU
HAVE
TO
EDIT
THAT
FILE
AND
RESTART
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DOING
SO
IS
CUMBERSOME
AND
TIMECONSUMING
THEREFORE
I
HAVE
IMPLEMENTED
FSQUEEZE
LEFT
CENTER
RIGHT
FUNCTIONS
IN
MY
OWN
COPY
OF
VTWM
THE
IDEA
BEING
THAT
WITH
ONE
CLICK
OF
A

YOU
CAN
CHANGE
THIS
TITLE
A
THIS
IS
THE

OF
THE

OKAY
SO
FAR
SO
GOOD
NOW
HOW
THE
HECK
DO
I
GET
THEM
TO
PUT
THIS
INTO
THE
NEXT
OFFICIAL
TWM
AND
THE
NEXT
TVTWM
AND
THE
NEXT
VTWM
AND
THE

CTWM
AND
THE
NEXT

THAT
I
NEVER
HEARD
OF
ONE
WAY
WOULD
BE
TO
POST
IN
COMPWINDOWSX
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THIS
ENHANCEMENT
TOGETHER
WITH
AN
EXPLANATION
OF
WHY
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
THING
AND
HOPE
THAT
SOMEONE
READS
IT
IN
CASE
IT
ISNT
ALREADY
CLEAR
WHY
I
THINK
ITS
A
VERY
GOOD
THING
LOOK
BACK
UP
AT

WHEN
YOU

THIS

IS

THE

OF

POSTING
EXPLAINS
HOW
TO
IMPLEMENT
IT
BASED
ON
MY
COPY
OF
VTVWMSHAR
ITS
JUST
A
SKETCH
BECAUSE
POSTING
THE
FULL
DIFFS
WOULD
BE
TOO
LONG
THE
KEY
TO
THIS
ENHANCEMENT
IS
TO

ABOUT
A

I
POSTED

I
THINK
IT
DIDNT
GET
OUT
SINCE
THEN
BLAST
HAS
APPEARED
IN

VOLUME
ISSUE
YOU
COULD
USE
BLAST
TO
ACHIEVE
A
SIMILAR
EFFECT
BY
CHISELING

BETTER
TO

THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
