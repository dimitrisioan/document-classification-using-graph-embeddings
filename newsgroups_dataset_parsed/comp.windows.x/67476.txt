re
table
widget
causing
trouble
with
xtquerygeometry
i
just
got
a
bug
report
and
a
fix
for
this
exact
problem
from
fisheriscpbellcorecom
greg
fisher
the
most
serious
problem
i
have
identified
has
not
been
incorporated
this
problem
occurs
when
the
table
widgets
geometrymanager
is
invoked
by
a
child
this
will
work
correctly
if
the
table
widgets
parent
complies
with
the
xt
protocols
however
if
they
do
not
as
is
the
case
for
some
motif
widgets
and
they
ignore
xtcwqueryonly
then
the
sizing
will
be
incorrect
in
order
to
see
this
problem
the
following
events
must
happen
a
child
of
the
table
widget
must
request
a
new
size
the
table
widget
must
query
its
parent
for
a
new
size
having
set
xtcwqueryonly
the
parent
must
ignore
the
xtcwqueryonly
bit
and
resize
the
table
widget
as
part
of
the
resize
xmptableforgetproposedlayout
is
called
this
will
set
twtablecurrentcols
and
twtablecurrentrows
to
zero
the
table
will
continue
setting
up
the
new
size
working
under
the
assumption
that
it
is
working
with
a
proposed
and
not
actual
layout
at
the
end
it
will
call
xmptablesaveproposedlayout
this
will
save
twtablecols
and
twtablerows
and
restore
their
values
from
twtablecurrentcols
and
twtablecurrentrows
however
these
have
already
been
set
to
zero
since
the
table
widget
has
already
been
resized
it
will
not
need
a
second
resize
next
another
widget
managed
by
some
ancestor
of
the
table
is
resized
this
results
in
the
parent
of
the
table
requesting
the
tables
preferred
size
since
twtablecols
and
twtablerows
are
zero
this
will
return
as
the
preferred
size
the
parent
is
very
likely
to
grant
this
request
resulting
in
a
loss
of
the
whole
table
from
the
display
he
isolated
the
problem
a
proposed
a
workaround
which
seems
precisely
correct
here
is
the
new
implementation
of
xmptablenewproposedlayout
which
will
be
released
with
the
next
update
in
weeks
