i
know
for
a
fact
that
the
eisa
version
of
the
orchid
prodesigner
iis
works
however
an
eisa
svga
card
is
likely
a
waste
of
money
when
comes
out
with
support
for
accelerated
chipsets
isa
eisa
and
vlb
will
all
be
supported
the
more
important
question
is
what
chipsets
are
supported
the
bus
is
basically
irrelevent
as
a
compatibility
issue
