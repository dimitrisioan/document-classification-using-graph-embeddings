re
xv
has
escaped
it
is
interesting
to
look
at
the
changes
of
mind
that
john
has
had
very
interested
indeed
this
is
against
this
kind
of
changes
that
the
gnu
copyleft
is
protecting
us
anyway
at
simulog
we
will
abandon
xv
we
were
using
it
mostly
for
slide
shows
because
of
its
loop
feature
that
display
does
not
have
display
from
the
wonderful
imagemagick
package
d
but
i
think
i
will
implement
it
myself
even
a
shellscript
should
do
the
job
and
forget
xv
cheers
christophe
mullersimulogfr
are
you
the
police
no
maam
were
musicians
