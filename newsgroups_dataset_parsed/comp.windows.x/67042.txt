has
anybody
implements
an
rpc
server
in
the
hp
xwindows
in
sun
xview
there
is
a
notifyenablerpcsvc
call
that
automatically
executes
the
rpc
processes
when
it
detects
an
incoming
request
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
similar
function
in
hp
xmotif
that
perform
the
same
function
ive
been
using
the
xrpc
package
for
about
a
year
now
i
believe
i
got
it
from
export
glad
to
hear
that
its
working
for
you
i
couldnt
find
it
on
export
however
simon
leinen
has
added
an
imakefile
and
an
athena
version
and
made
it
available
for
ftp
in
the
file
note
the
z
suffix
youll
need
gnu
gzip
also
on
in
pubgnu
to
uncompress
it
if
this
doesnt
work
send
me
a
note
and
id
be
happy
to
mail
you
a
copy
but
you
probably
wont
get
it
until
the
start
of
may
im
on
holidays
as
of
tomorrow
