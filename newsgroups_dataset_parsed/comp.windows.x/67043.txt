IM
RUNNING
ON
AN

IVE
CREATED
A

AND
AM
USING
ALMOST
ALL

I
WANT
TO
DRAW
THE

IN
A

A
WIDGET

IM

IF
DOESNT
MATTER
IF
THE

I
DRAW
INTERACTIVELY
STAY
AROUND

THE

INTERACTIVELY
I
BEGIN
WITH

IF
THE

ARE
OVER

NOTHING
SHOWS

ITS
VERY
STRANGE
BUT
THE

FUNCTION
SEEMS
RIGHT
SINCE
IF
I
DO
A
RUBBERBANDING
BOX
IT
ERASES
AND
REDRAWS
ITSELF
CORRECTLY
IE
NOT
DISTURBING
THE
UNDERLYING

ANY
SUGGESTIONS
WHAT
IM
DOING
WRONG
I
BELIEVE
FOR
THIS
TO
WORK
ON
A

DISPLAY
YOU
MUST
SET
THE
FOREGROUND
OF
THE
GC
TO
BE
