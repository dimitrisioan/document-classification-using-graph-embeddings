program
to
display
gif
files
it
seems
silly
but
while
ive
located
things
like
tgif
that
can
edit
gif
files
and
various
tools
to
convert
tofrom
gif
format
i
havent
been
able
to
locate
a
program
that
just
opens
a
window
and
displays
a
gif
file
in
it
ive
looked
thru
various
faq
files
also
to
no
avail
is
there
one
lurking
about
in
some
archive
nothing
sophisticated
just
show
the
pretty
picture
alternatively
if
i
could
locate
the
specs
for
gif
i
dont
suppose
it
would
be
too
hard
to
write
it
myself
but
i
have
no
idea
where
to
even
start
looking
for
the
spec
well
actually
i
do
have
an
idea
this
newsgroup
if
the
auto
industry
were
like
the
computer
industry
a
car
would
now
cost
would
get
miles
to
the
gallon
and
at
random
times
would
explode
killing
all
its
passengers
