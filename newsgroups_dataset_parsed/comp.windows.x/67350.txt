however
there
is
hello
motif
world
over
the
past
half
year
there
have
been
a
lot
of
relatively
minor
changes
to
the
motif
bindings
imake
support
has
been
improved
a
few
defaults
have
been
changed
and
a
lot
of
other
small
things
have
been
added
this
is
basically
a
release
which
drops
the
gamma
status
next
release
will
incorporate
some
improvements
by
stefan
schwarz
and
possibly
will
support

is
the
original
announcement
history
the
university
of
lowell
supported
by
a
grant
of
the
open
software
foundation
has
developed
a
wrapperlibrary
that
encapsulates
motif
widgets
in
c
classes
all
resources
of
these
widgets
can
now
be
set
through
memberfunctions
while
objects
can
be
used
in
callbackfunctions
the
library
was
made
available
for
free
or
nominal
cost
for
anonymous
ftp
at
however
the
library
contained
a
large
number
of
bugs
and
oversights
and
only
worked
under
due
to
lack
of
subsequent
fundings
the
bindings
are
no
longer
actively
supported
by
the
university
of
lowell
i
ronald
van
loon
at
a
certain
point
last
year
have
taken
the
lowell
bindings
fixing
the
bugs
i
came
across
adding
missing
memberfunctions
and
enhancing
functionality
and
made
the
bugfixed
library
available
for
the
general
public
for
anonymous
ftp
made
possible
by
rick
murphy
at
dec
new
release
i
am
now
pleased
to
announce
a
new
and
updated
release
of
the
motif
bindings
this
release
offers
full
and
support
support
for
xbae
widgetset
two
additional
widgets
written
by
myself
that
can
be
used
to
indicate
progress
in
an
application
imake
support
nb
this
release
relies
heavily
on
the
existence
of
imake
and
its
config
files
on
your
site
i
have
tried
to
provide
the
bindings
with
a
standard
makefile
tweakable
for
those
unfortunates
without
imake
i
have
not
severely
tested
the
standard
makefile
though
contact
me
if
you
have
problems
the
reason
for
calling
this
a
gamma
release
lies
in
the
fact
that
i
do
not
have
a
multitude
of
platforms
to
test
the
imakefiles
on
lots
of
testfiles
even
somewhat
useful
programs
