HOW
DO
I
MODIFY
KEY
MAP
HELLO
FOLKS
IM
SEEING
THESE
ERRORS
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
MODIFY
MY
KEY
MAP
MWM
INVALID
ACCELERATOR
SPECFICATION
LINE
X
IVE
ADDED
A
LINE
IN
THE
START
UP
FILE
BEFORE
THE
LINE
THAT
STARTS
MWM
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THE
FOLLOWING
XMODMAP
KEYMAPFILE
MWM
I
THINK
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
A
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
FUNCTION
KEYS
THROUGH
WHICH
ALREADY
HAVE
ASSIGNED
FUNCTIONS
EG
MOVE
MINIMIZE
ETC
THE
ODD
THING
IS
THAT
I
DONT
SEE
THESE
ERRORS
IF
I
RUN
XMODMAP
KEYMAPFILE
FROM
AN
XTERM
CAN
ANYONE
SUGGEST
A
WAY
TO
MODIFY
THE
KEY
MAP
SPECIFICALLY
THROUGH
AND
NOT
HAVE
MWM
MOTIF
WINDOW
MANAGER
COMPLAIN
I
REALIZE
THIS
IS
A
BIT
STUPID
BUT
WE
ONLY
HAVE
TIME
TO
IMPLEMENT
NOT
TIME
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
IMPLEMENT
