how
do
i
modify
key
map
hello
folks
im
seeing
these
errors
when
i
try
to
modify
my
key
map
mwm
invalid
accelerator
specfication
line
x
ive
added
a
line
in
the
start
up
file
before
the
line
that
starts
mwm
it
looks
like
the
following
xmodmap
keymapfile
mwm
i
think
that
the
problem
has
to
do
with
a
conflict
between
function
keys
through
which
already
have
assigned
functions
eg
move
minimize
etc
the
odd
thing
is
that
i
dont
see
these
errors
if
i
run
xmodmap
keymapfile
from
an
xterm
can
anyone
suggest
a
way
to
modify
the
key
map
specifically
through
and
not
have
mwm
motif
window
manager
complain
i
realize
this
is
a
bit
stupid
but
we
only
have
time
to
implement
not
time
to
learn
how
to
implement
