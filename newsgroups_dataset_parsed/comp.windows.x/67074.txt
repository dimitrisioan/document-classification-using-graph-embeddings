re
mix
gl
with
x
xlibxtmwm
yes
its
possible
in
fact
theres
some
gl
widget
code
in
usrlppgl
somewhere
its
named
glibc
my
ibms
down
right
now
though
so
i
cant
find
the
exact
location
warning
this
code
feels
quite
bogus
it
does
things
like
calling
noport
before
winopen
and
then
extracting
an
x
window
id
from
it
anyway
it
worked
just
fine
under
aix
i
spent
last
weekend
trying
to
port
it
to
gl
under
doesnt
seem
to
like
it
and
its
turning
into
a
hard
job
check
out
your
info
pages
it
has
some
pretty
good
documentation
on
whan
you
can
and
cant
do
when
mixing
gl
and
x
and
how
to
go
about
doing
so
