VANISHING
FONT
PROBLEM
A
COLLEAGUE
HAS
A
BIZARRE
FONT
PROBLEM
ON
HIS
NEW
MIPS
WORKSTATION
WHEN
HE
FIRST
LOGS
ON
VIA
XDM
HE
HAS
A
SINGLE
XTERM
WINDOW
APPEAR
WITH
THE
MWM
WINDOW
MANAGER
RUNNING
IN
THIS
CONFIGURATION
X
WINDOWS
APPLICATIONS
PARTICULARLY
XDVI
WORK
FINE
HOWEVER
IF
HE
OPENS
UP
A
SECOND
XTERM
APPLICATION
SUDDENLY
XDVI
CANNOT
START
IN
EITHER
WINDOW
GIVING
THE
ERROR
UNABLE
TO
LOAD
ISO
FONT
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
XTERM
WINDOWS
IS
THAT
THE
INITIAL
ONE
REFERENCES
A
DIFFERENT
NAME
IN
THE
XSESSION
FILE
WITH
PRETTIER
COLOURS
AND
OTHER
SLIGHT
CHANGES
FURTHER
INVESTIGATION
SHOWS
THAT
ONLY
OPENING
A
DEFAULT
XTERM
CAUSES
THIS
BEHAVIOUR
AND
MORE
SIGNIFICANT
ALL
X
APPLICATIONS
CAN
NO
LONGER
LOAD
ANY
FONTS
IF
THEY
ARE
INVOKED
FROM
THE
COMMAND
LINE
IN
EITHER
WINDOW
IF
I
START
THE
XTERM
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
FONT
USING
THE
FN
OPTION
NO
PROBLEMS
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
THE
DEFAULT
XTERM
IS
LOADING
A
FONT
WHICH
SOMEHOW
CAUSES
THE
SERVER
TO
LOSE
ALL
OF
ITS
FONTS
NOTE
XLSFONTS
IN
EITHER
WINDOW
SHOWS
ALL
OF
THE
FONTS
AVAILABLE
SO
THERE
DOESNT
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
PROBLEM
IN
THE
FONT
DIRECTORIESHASHTABLES
OTHER
THAN
REWRITING
THE
XTERM
APPDEFAULTS
FILE
TO
USE
A
DIFFERENT
FONT
AND
HOPE
FOR
THE
BEST
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEAS
MORE
INFO
THIS
IS
THE
MOST
RECENT
MIPS
WORKSTATION
I
BELIEVE
WITH
THE
MOST
CURRENT
OPERATING
SYSTEM
AND
RUNNING
IT
IS
NOT
MWMS
FAULT
AS
THE
SAME
PROBLEMS
OCCUR
UNDER
TWM
ETC
