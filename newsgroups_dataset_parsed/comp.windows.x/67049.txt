HI
IM
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
TO
MAKE
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
PLACE
THE
WINDOW
WHERE
THE
CREATE
WINDOW
COMMAND
TELLS
IT
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
IT
MAY
THINK
IS
RIGHT
MY
APPLICATION
HAS
REASON
TO
KNOW
BETTER
I
DONT
WANT
TO
SET
THE
OVERRIDEREDIRECT
BECAUSE
I
DO
WANT
ALL
THE
EMBELLISHMENTS
THAT
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
GIVES
I
JUST
WANT
THE
WM
TO
ACCEPT
MY
CHOICE
OF
LOCATION
WINDOW
XCREATEWINDOW
XSETTRANSIENTFORHINTDISPLAY

XMAPWINDOW
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
CHEATING
AND
SOME
WINDOW
MANAGERS

STILL

USUALLY
WORKS
