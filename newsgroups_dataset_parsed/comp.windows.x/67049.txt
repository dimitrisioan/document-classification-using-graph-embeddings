hi
im
trying
to
figure
out
how
to
make
a
window
manager
place
the
window
where
the
create
window
command
tells
it
regardless
of
what
it
may
think
is
right
my
application
has
reason
to
know
better
i
dont
want
to
set
the
overrideredirect
because
i
do
want
all
the
embellishments
that
the
window
manager
gives
i
just
want
the
wm
to
accept
my
choice
of
location
window
xcreatewindow
xsettransientforhintdisplay
window
window
xmapwindow
this
is
probably
cheating
and
some
window
managers
might
still
refuse
to
give
it
a
border
and
all
that
other
stuff
but
it
usually
works
