I
AM
WORKING
ON
A
PROJECT
TO
PROVIDE
AN
EMERGENCY
MANAGEMENT
INFORMATION
SYSTEM
IN
KEEPING
WITH
MORE
CLASSIC
COMMAND
AND
CONTROL
TYPE
SYSTEMS
WE
ARE
CONSIDERING
DEVELOPING
A
DUAL
SCREEN
MONITOR
SYSTEM
IN
ORDER
TO
PROVIDE
A
STATUS
BOARD
ON
ITS
OWN
MONITOR
I
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
X
LEVEL
QUESTIONS
REGARDING
THIS
WE
ARE
DEVLOPING
ON
UNIX

BE
PREDOMINANTLY

PROBABLY
WITH

TO
AS
WELL
I
AM
ASSUMING
THE
STANDARD
DUAL
MONITOR
SYSTEMS
ARE
CONFIGURED
SUCH
THAT
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
ONE
X
DISPLAY
AND
MULTIPLE
SCREENS
AND
NOT
MULTIPLE
X
DISPLAYS
GIVEN
THIS
IS
CHANGING
INPUT
FOCUS
FROM
ONE
SCREEN
TO
THE
OTHER
AS
SIMPLE
AS
TRACKING
YOUR
MOUSE
FROM
ONE
SCREEN
TO
THE
OTHER
THERES
NOTHING
SPECIAL
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
DONE
TO
SHIFT
FOCUS
BETWEEN
SCREENS
DO
I
HAVE
TO
RUN

WHO

IS

MANAGER
THE
ONLY
WAY
I
CAN
GRAB
A
WINDOW
FRAME
AND
MOVE
A
WINDOW
FROM
ONE
SCREEN
TO
THE
NEXT
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
FOR
THE
APPLICATION
TO
TRANSPARENTLY
SEE
MULTIPLE
SCREENS
AS
ONE
LOGICAL
XY
PLANE
OR
DOES
THE
HARDWARE
ONLY
PROVIDE
FOR
EACH
SCREEN
TO
START
AT
ANY
THOUGHTS
ON
THE
DIFFICULTIES
INVOLVED
WITH
DESIGNING
A
SYSTEM
CAPABLE
OF
USING
EITHER
MULTIPLE
SCREENS
OR
A
SINGLE
SCREEN
PERHAPS
RUNNING
A
VIRTUAL
WINDOW
MANAGER
TO
SIMULATE
MULTIPLE
SCREENS
INSTEAD
I
AM
ASSUMING
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
A
MAJOR
ISSUE
THAT
I
CAN
RELY
ON
PROVIDING
CONFIG
FILES
WHICH
WILL
SPECIFY
FOR
EACH
CONFIGURATION
THE
SCREEN
PLACEMENT
OF
EACH

IN
THE

ANY
