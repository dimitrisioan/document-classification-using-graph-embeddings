NICHOLAS
YOUNG
WRITES
I
NEED
PROBABLY
TO
WRITE
ONE
OR
MORE
NEW
MOTIF
WIDGETS
ON
THE
HPUX
PLATFORM
DO
I
NEED
THE
MOTIF
PRIVATE
HEADER
FILES
AND
SOURCE
OR
CAN
I
MAKE
DO
WITH
THE
PUBLIC
HEADERS
THAT
ARE
PROVIDED
MOTIF
INCLUDES
XT
IN
THIS
CONTEXT
YES
YOULL
FIND
IT
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
WITHOUT
THE
SOURCE
AT
THIS
POINT
IT
DOES
DEPEND
ON
HOW
AMBITIOUS
YOU
ARE
AND
HOW
CONCERNED
YOU
ARE
ABOUT
COMPLIANCE
WITH
THE
GENERAL
INTERFACE
AND
ITEMS
LIKE
TRAVERSAL
ONE
WIDGET
IS
A
MULTICOLUMN
LIST
WHICH
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALREADY
WRITTEN
I
AM
SURE
AND
WOULD
THEREFORE
BE
PROBABLY
BE
A
SUBCLASS
OF
LIST
RATHER
THAN
SOMETHING
SIMPLE
LIKE
AN
XT
CLASS
IS
THIS
MORE
DIFFICULT
IN
PRINCIPLE
NOT
LINES
OF
CODE
IM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOURE
ASKING
YOU
COULD
CREATE
SOMETHING
WHICH
IS
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
A
TRUE
MULTICOLUMN
LIST
BY
PLACING
SEVERAL
LISTS
WITHIN
A
GEOMETRY
MANAGER
AND
PUTTING
THAT
MANAGER
WITHIN
AN
AUTOMATIC
SCROLLED
WINDOW
THIS
WOULDNT
BE
GOOD
FOR
VERY
LARGE
LISTS
BUT
YOU
MIGHT
CONSIDER
THIS
AS
AN
ALTERNATIVE
ALTERNATIVELY
IF
ANYONE
HAS
A
MULTICOLUMN
LIST
WIDGET
THEY
COULD
SELL
ME
THIS
MIGHT
SAVE
ME
FROM
HAVING
TO
WRITE
ONE
DOES
IT
BY
ANY
CHANCE
EXIST
IN
MOTIF
ALREADY
I
DO
NOT
YET
HAVE
THE
SPEC
MOTIF
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
MULTICOLUMN
LIST
IN
IT
HAVE
YOU
LOOKED
AT
COMMERCIAL
SETS
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SOME
PD
WIDGET
SETS
ONE
OF
THESE

HAVE
