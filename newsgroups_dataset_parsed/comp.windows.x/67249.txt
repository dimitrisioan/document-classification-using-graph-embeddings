looking
for
x
window
server
frequencyofoperations
data
hello
im
currently
designing
the
architecture
of
a
chip
which
is
intended
to
help
speed
up
common
operations
on
a
windowing
system
such
as
x
a
friend
and
i
are
designing
the
chip
as
the
final
course
project
for
an
advanced
computer
architecture
course
taught
by
dr
fred
brooks
at
uncchapel
hill
while
we
feel
that
weve
got
a
pretty
solid
design
currently
wed
really
like
to
get
ahold
of
some
frequency
data
from
an
xwindows
server
so
that
we
can
make
the
most
effective
use
of
our
bit
budget
unfortunately
ive
been
unable
to
find
anything
of
this
sort
in
the
various
x
faqs
or
x
manuals
that
ive
seen
does
anyone
have
some
type
of
frequency
data
like
how
many
copyrectangle
operations
vs
drawlines
and
things
of
that
sort
or
barring
that
a
program
that
records
requests
to
the
server
into
a
logfile
that
i
can
munge
on
myself
any
and
all
help
would
be
very
appreciated
many
thanks
