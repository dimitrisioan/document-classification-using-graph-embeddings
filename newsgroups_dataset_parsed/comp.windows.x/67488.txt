most
graphics
systems
i
have
seen
have
drawing
routines
that
also
specify
a
color
for
drawing
like

or
with

i
have
to
do
something
like
xsetforegroundcurrentcolor
xdrawpointdwxy
why
split
this
into
two
functions
why
did
x
designers
decide
to
not
associate
the

with
the
object
being
drawn
and
instead
associate
