DO
ANYONE
KNOW
ABOUT
ANY
SHADING
PROGRAM
BASED
ON
XLIB
IN
THE
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
I
NEED
AN
EXAMPLE
ABOUT
HOW
TO
ALLOCATE
CORRECT
COLORMAPS
FOR
THE
PROGRAM
APPRECIATE
THE
HELP
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
MIGHT
HELP
BUT
IVE
JUST
STARTED
PLAYING
WITH
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
POVRAY
PERSISTANCE
OF
VISION
RAYTRACER
THAT
ALSO
DISPLAYS
ITS
OUTPUT
VIA
X
WINDOWS
IT
DOES
A
FAIRLY
GOOD
JOB
OF
ALLOCATING
THE
COLORMAP
ON
MY
PSUEDOCOLOR

I
GOT
THE

FROM
FROM
A
SITE
IN

THE
PERSON
I
RETRIEVED

FROM
WAS
DAVID
BUCK
DBUCKCCSCARLETONCA
I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
POST
WAS
SEARCHING
FOR
EXISTING
IMPLEMENTATIONS
OF
FI
GOUROUDSHADING
OF
TRIANGLES
THIS
IS
FAIRLY
COMPLEX
TO
DO
WITH
PLAIN
X
SIMPLER
SHADING
MODELS
ARE
IMPLEMENTED
ALREADY
FI
IN
ASK
ARCHIE
WHERE
TO
GET
THE
LATEST
VERSION
FOR
GOUROUD
A
FAST
IMPLEMENTATION
WILL
BE
POSSIBLE
UTILIZING
SOME
EXTENSION
ONLY
EITHER
MITSHM
TO
DO
THE
SHADE
IN
AN
IMAGE
AND
FAST
UPDATE
THE
WINDOW
WITH
IT
OR
PEXOPENGL
WHICH
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
SHADE
THEMSELVES
THE
PORTABLE
VANILLA
X
WAY
WOULD
BE
TO
SHADE
IN
A
NORMAL
XIMAGE
AND
USE
XPUTIMAGE
WHAT
WOULD
BE
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
DO
STATIC
THINGS
AS
FI
FRACTAL
LANDSCAPES
OR
SUCH
STUFF
TO
SPEAK
ABOUT
POVRAY
THE
X
PREVIEWER
THAT
COMES
WITH
THE
ORIGINAL

PACKAGE
IS
NOT
THAT
GOOD
ESPECIALLY
IN

PROTOCOLFRIENDLYNESS
