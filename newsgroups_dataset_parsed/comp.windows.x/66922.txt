the

and
appears
to

something
valid
just
not
the
right
number
it
always
seems
to
return
the
same
number
regardless
of
the
window
number
stored
in
the
property
returnplace
is
probably
incorrect
it
should
be
a
pointer
not
an
integer
xgetwindowproperty
allocates
memory
copies
the
data
there
and
returns
a
pointer
to
the
memory
you
should
free
the

when
youre
done
