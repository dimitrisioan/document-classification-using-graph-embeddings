QUESTION
I
AM
ALMOST
DONE
PORTING
TO
A
NEW
PIECE
OF
DISPLAY
HARDWARE
BUT
HAVE
RUN
INTO
A
SNAG
I
THINK
MAY
BE
SOMEWHAT
COMMONPLACE
SO
IM
SENDING
A
NETFEELER
I
HAVE
A
DISPLAY
THAT
IS
A
NONINTERLACED
MEMORY
MAPPED
DISPLAY
THE
SERVERS
VIEW
OF
THE
WORLD
OBTAINED
VIA
XWD
XWUD
SEEMS
TO
BE
EXACTLY
WHAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
HOWEVER
THE
DISPLAYED
VERSION
OF
THE
FRAMEBUFFER
GIVES
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
SERVER
IS
USING
SCANLINES
THAT
ARE
TOO
LONG
AFTER
A
BIT
OF
EXPERIMENTATION
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
THE
SERVER
WAS
PADDING
THE
LINE
OUT
TO
A
WORD
BOUNDRY
BUT
THE
SCANLINE
SIZE
IN
THE
BUFFER
IS
BYTES
WHICH
ISNT
EXACTLY
DIVISIBLE
BY
FOUR

THE
RIGHT
SOLUTION
HOW

THE

DONT
PAD
THE
SCAN
LINES
AT
ALL
CAUSE
THIS
SERVER
IS
ONLY
BEING
BUILT
TO
RUN
ON
THIS
PARTICULAR
DISPLAY
OR
TO
PAD
ONLY
TO

IM
