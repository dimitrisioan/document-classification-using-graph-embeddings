i
have
a
problem
which
many
of
you
might
have
run
into
we
use
lots
of
ascii
terminals
and
use
them
to
the
max
meaning
lots
of
attributes
line
this
means
needing
all
attributes
to
work
including
bold
and
line
drawing
the
only
fonts
which
seem
to
meet
these
criteria
are
a
pairs
of
fonts
in
which
one
is
bold
and
the
other
normal
while
both
have
linedraw
fixed
spacing
and
several
sizes
the
only
standard
fonts
which
work
are
the
fonts
like
and
under
misc
they
work
great
except
i
need
a
font
one
size
larger
now
works
well
but
there
is
no
bold
counterpart
you
dont
need
a
bold
counterpart
from
man
xterm
fb
font
this
option
specifies
a
font
to
be
used
when
dis
playing
bold
text
this
font
must
be
the
same
height
and
width
as
the
normal
font
if
only
one
of
the
normal
or
bold
fonts
is
specified
it
will
be
used
as
the
normal
font
and
the
bold
font
will
be
produced
by
overstriking
this
font
the
default
is
to
do
overstriking
of
the
normal
font
i
have
tried
that
with
one
font
if
your
xterm
terminfostermcaps
are
set
up
to
not
remap
bold
which
they
are
be
default
to
reverse
then
nothing
happens
when
bold
is
displayed
it
would
appear
at
least
in
than
you
cannot
display
bold
in
an
xterm
without
specifying
two
fonts
a
normal
and
a
bold
i
wish
someone
would
prove
that
incorrect
