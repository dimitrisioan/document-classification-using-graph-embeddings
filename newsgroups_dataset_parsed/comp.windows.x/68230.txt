RE
BLINKING
CURSOR
IN
XTERM
BACK
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
I
DID
ANALYSE
THE
XTERM
CODE
THE
CURSOR
WAS
IMPLEMENTED
BY
DRAWING
A
RECTANGLE
AROUND
THE
CHARACTER
I
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
CHANGED
TIL
NOW
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
THE
SOURCES
YOU
COULD
ADD
A
BLINKING
CURSOR
VIA
XTAPPADDTIMEOUT
OR
SIMILAR
THE
SERVER
OVERHEAD
FOR
THIS
IS
MILDLY
RIDICULOUS
THOUGH
SEE
ALSO
DESQVIEWX
WHICH
DOES
THIS
IN
ITS
DOS
WINDOWS
DO
YOU
REALLY
WANT
XTERM
TO
WAKE
UP
EVERY
HALF
SECOND
AND
WHACK
THE
SERVER
INTO
DOING
A
BITBLT
MOST
DOS
X
SERVERS
ARE
TERRIBLY
SLOW
TO
USE
IN
MY
EXPERIENCE
AND
NO
I
GUESS
PERFORMANCE
WOULD
BE
PRETTY
BAD
I
BELIEVE
THE
DISCUSSION
IS
VALID
FOR
AN
X
SERVER
ON
A
DECENT
WORKSTATION
THE
ENO
THE
TROUBLE
WITH
NEW
AGE
JANET
MUSIC
IS
THAT
THERES
NO
ENOUKACCITYCS
EVIL
IN
IT
BRIAN
