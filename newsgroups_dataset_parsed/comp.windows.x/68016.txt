I
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WHICH
MANY
OF
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
RUN
INTO
WE
USE
LOTS
OF
ASCII
TERMINALS
AND
USE
THEM
TO
THE
MAX
MEANING
LOTS
OF
ATTRIBUTES
LINE
DRAW
ETC
NOW
WHAT
I
NEED
TO
DO
IS
COME
UP
WITH
A
WORKING
XTERM
WHICH
WILL
EMULATE
OUR
ADVANCED
ASCII
TERMINALS
AS
CLOSELY
AS
POSSIBLE
THIS
MEANS
NEEDING
ALL
ATTRIBUTES
TO
WORK
INCLUDING
BOLD
AND
LINE
DRAWING
THE
ONLY
FONTS
WHICH
SEEM
TO
MEET
THESE
CRITERIA
ARE
A
PAIRS
OF
FONTS
IN
WHICH
ONE
IS
BOLD
AND
THE
OTHER
NORMAL
WHILE
BOTH
HAVE
LINEDRAW
FIXED
SPACING
AND
SEVERAL
SIZES
THE
ONLY
STANDARD
FONTS
WHICH
WORK
ARE
THE
FONTS
LIKE
AND
UNDER
MISC
THEY
WORK
GREAT
EXCEPT
I
NEED
A
FONT
ONE
SIZE
LARGER
NOW
WORKS
WELL
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
BOLD
COUNTERPART
TO
MAKE
MATTERS
WORSE
I
NEED
THE
FONTS
IN
SOME
FORM
I
CAN
USE
FOR
TEKTRONIX
XTERMINALS
IT
SEEMS
THEY
LIKE
PCF
FORMAT
ALTHOUGH
I
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
CONVERT
A
BDF
FORMAT
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS

THIS
WOULD
BE
TEDIOUS
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
THE
TIME
YOU
COULD
GET
THE
BDF
FILE
I
CAN
EMAIL
IT
TO
YOU
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
IT
OR
DONT
HAVE
EASY
ACCESS
TO
THE
X
SOURCE
AND
COULD
MAKE
YOUR
OWN
BOLD
FONT
FROM
THIS
SINCE
EACH
GLYPH
IS
JUST
A
BITMAP
YOU
COULD
WRITE
A
PROGRAM
TO
CONVERT
EACH
GLYPH
TO
A
BITMAPREADABLE
FILE
USE
BITMAP
TO
MAKE
EACH
GLYPH
BOLD
AND
CONVERT
THE
RESULTS
BACK
TO
BDF
FORMAT
THEN
USE
BDFTOPCF
TO
CREATE
THE
PCF
FILE
THEN
STICK
THE
PCF
IN
OR
WHEREVER
AND
INCLUDE
IT
IN
FONTSDIR
AND
VOILA
