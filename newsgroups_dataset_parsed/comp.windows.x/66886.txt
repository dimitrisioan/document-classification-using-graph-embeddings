my
impression
is
that
most
people
use
motif
because
their
os
vendor
supplies
it
with
x
sunos
users
excluded
and
because
it
is
similar
in
look
and
feel
to
mswindows
and
pm
personally
i
also
prefer
the
look
and
feel
of
motif
no
flames
please
just
an
opinion
seeing
as
motif
has
been
adopted
by
sun
ibm
hp
cant
remeber
the
other
members
in
the
recent
announcement
im
sure
youll
see
it
on
virtually
every
workstation
ie
sun
ibm
hp
and
dec
must
make
up
the
vast
majority
of
all
hardware
i
am
also
concerned
by
this
prevalence
of
motif
particularly
from
the
point
of
view
of
writing
and
obtaining
free
software
as
the
linux
and
communities
grow
however
i
think
that
motif
will
lose
some
of
its
grip
at
least
in
the
noncommercial
marketplace
ports
of
motif
to
both
and
linux
are
available
for
a
fee
of
about
this
is
cost
recovery
for
the
person
who
bought
the
rights
to
redistribute
the
activity
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
groups
pertaining
to
motif
has
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
this
will
also
cause
a
divergence
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
software
ie
you
will
only
get
free
software
using
athena
or
openlook
widget
sets
and
only
get
commercial
software
using
the
motif
widget
sets
i
cant
see
why
if
just
about
every
workstation
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platforms
i
cant
see
this
causing
major
problems
side
note
all
the
x
based
code
i
am
writing
and
will
distribute
freely
when
completed
is
based
on
motif
because
from
a
programmatic
and
also
look
and
feel
point
of
view
i
like
it
the
best
no
flames
on
this
one
