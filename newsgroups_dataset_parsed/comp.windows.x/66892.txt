motif
mailing
list
is
there
any
interest
hello
motif
world
a
few
days
ago
i
posted
my
announcement
for
an
update
of
motif
i
got
several
requests
to
send
the
bindings
per
email
and
i
know
of
several
people
who
have
been
using
motif
and
there
are
probably
a
number
of
people
i
am
not
aware
of
who
are
also
using
motif
my
question
is
how
many
people
out
there
would
be
interested
to
join
a
mailinglist
where
people
can
ask
questions
about
motif
swap
stories
and
give
new
ideas
about
new
directions
and
improvements
for
the
bindings
this
would
benefit
the
usercommunity
as
well
as
give
me
more
insight
in
what
people
would
like
to
see
added
to
motif
motif
is
still
very
much
a
voluntary
project
and
this
way
i
can
make
a
list
of
priorities
in
what
order
things
should
be
added
or
changed
if
youre
interested
in
joining
such
a
mailinglist
please
take
the
time
to
reply
to
this
message
and
tell
me
so
when
there
is
sufficient
interest
say
about
people
or
more
a
mailinglist
will
be
set
up
at
my
site
and
i
will
post
the
announcement
of
the
newlycreated
list
to
this
and
other
newsgroups
