WRITES
ANIMATION
IS
MOST
FREQUENTLY
DONE
BY
COPYING
THE
THE
CLIENT
RESIDENT
XIMAGES
INTO
SERVER
RESIDENT
PIXMAPS
USING
XPUTIMAGE
ONCE
THIS
IS
DONE
THE
ORIGINAL
XIMAGES
CAN
BE
DELETED
AND
THE
ANIMATION
LOOP
CAN
BE
PERFORMED
USING
XCOPYAREA
FROM
THE
PIXMAPS
TO
THE
WINDOWS
DRAWABLE
HOPE
THIS
IS
HELPFULL
JOHN
I
JUST
IMPLEMENTED
THIS
AND
IT
SEEMS
I
CAN
JUST
ABOUT
ACHIEVE
THE
DISPLAY
RATES
FRAMES
SEC
ON
IPX
THAT
I
GET
WITH
SUNVIEW
THOUGH
ITS
A
BIT
CHOPPY
AT
TIMES
ALSO
LOADING
THE
DATA
MAKING
AN
XIMAGE
THEN
XPUTING
IT
INTO
A
PIXMAP
IS
A
BIT
CUMBERSOME
SO
THE
ANIMATION
IS
SLOWER
TO
LOAD
THAN
WITH
SUNVIEW
IS
THERE
A
BETTER
WAY
TO
LOAD
IN
THE
DATA

IF
YOU
NEED
SPEED
AND
YOUR
CLIENT
CAN
RUN
ON
THE
SAME
HOST
AS
THE
X
SERVER
YOU
SHOULD
USE
THE
SHARED
MEMORY
EXTENSION
TO
THE
SAMPLE
X
SERVER
MITSHM
XDPYINFO
WILL
TELL
YOU
IF
YOUR
SERVER
HAS
THIS
EXTENSION
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
AVAILABLE
WITH
THE
SAMPLE
MIT
X
SERVER
RUNNING
UNDER
SUNOS
A
WORD
OF
WARNING
MAKE
SURE
YOUR
KERNEL
IS
CONFIGURED
TO
SUPPORT
SHARED
MEMORY
AND
ANOTHER
WORD
OF
WARNING
OPENWINDOWS
IS
SLOWER
THAN
THE
MIT
SERVER
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
AN
IMAGING
TOOL
USING
XVIEW
FOR
THE
GUI
BY
THE
WAY
WHICH
YIELDS
OVER
FRAMES
PER
SECOND
FOR
BIT
IMAGES
RUNNING
ON
A
SPARC
IPC
HALF
THE
CPU
GRUNT
OF
AN
IPX
THIS
HAS
PROVED
QUITE
SUFFICIENT
FOR
ANIMATIONS
REGARDS

LOOKS
INTERESTING
BUT
I
NEED
SOMEONE
TO
POINT
ME
TO
SOME
DOCUMENTATION
IS
THIS
METHOD
LIKELY
TO
GIVE
BETTER
RESULTS
THAN
SERVER

ID
ALSO
BE
INTERESTED
IN
LOOKING
AT

MENTIONED

THANKS
FOR
THE
HELP

IF
I
GET
SOMETHING
DECENT
PUT

DEFINITELY
