monthly
question
about
xcopyarea
and
expose

excerpts

monthly
question
about
xcop
buzz
moschettibearcom
a
button
widget
when
pressed
will
cause
a
new
item
to
be
drawn
in
the
window
this
action
clearly
should
not
call
xcopyarea
or
equiv
directly
instead
it
should
register
the
existence
of
the
new
item
in
a
memory
structure
and
let
the
same
expose
event
handler
that
handles
regular
expose
events
eg
window
managerdriven
exposures
take
care
of
rendering
the
new
image
hmmm
clearly
depends
on
your
programming
model
it
is
not
at
all
forbidden
to
draw
outside
the
context
of
an
expose
event
certainly
any
internal
data
structures
should
be
maintained
such
that
the
visual
appearance
would
be
maintained
properly
whenever
an
expose
event
happens
to
be
generated
this
doesnt
preclude
drawing
immediately
after
updating
the
datastructures
though
