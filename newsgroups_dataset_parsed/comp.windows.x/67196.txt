IGNITE

WRITES
I
POSTED
THIS
A
WHILE
AGO
AND
DIDNT
RECEIVE
ONE
REPLY
AND
NOW
WE
HAVE
ANOTHER
BUG
REPORT
ON
THE
SAME
SUBJECT
CAN
ANYBODY
HELP
ME
OUT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
MOTIF
USES
XGRABKEY
TO
IMPLEMENT
MENU
ACCELERATORS
AND
THESE
GRABS
ARE
SPECIFIC
ABOUT
WHICH
MODIFIERS
APPLY
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
SPECIFICATION
FOR
XGRABKEY
DOESNT
ALLOW
ANYMODIFIER
TO
BE
COMBINED
WITH
OTHER
MODIFIERS
WHICH
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
WOULD
BE
DESIRED
IN
THIS
CASE
CTRL
ANYKEYQ
IN
ORA
VOL
IN
THE
SECTION
ON
ACCELERATORS
IT
SAYS
FOR
INFORMATION
ON
HOW
TO
SPECIFY
TRANSLATION
TABLES
SEE
VOL
THIS
IS
SO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
TO
PUT
FOR
THE
XMNACCELERATOR
RESOURCE
IF
YOU
GO
TO
VOL
IT
SAYS
LIKEWISE
IF
A
MODIFIER
IS
SPECIFIED
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
PROHIBIT
OTHER
MODIFIERS
FROM
BEING
PRESENT
AS
WELL
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
TRANSLATION
SHIFTKEYQ
QUIT
WILL
TAKE
EFFECT
EVEN
IF
THE
CTRL
KEY
IS
HELD
DOWN
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AS
THE
SHIFT
KEY
AND
THE
Q
KEY
THIS
IS
TRUE
FOR
ACCELERATORS
AND
MNEMONICS
WHICH
ARE
IMPLEMENTED
USING
EVENT
HANDLERS
INSTEAD
OF
GRABS
ITS
NOT
TRUE
FOR
MENU
ACCELERATORS
IF
YOURE
A
MOTIF
IMPLEMENTOR
ID
SUGGEST
LOBBYING
TO
GET
THE
XLIB
SEMANTICS
CHANGED
TO
SUPPORT
THE
FEATURE
I
DESCRIBED
ABOVE
OTHERWISE
CHANGE
THE
DOCUMENTATION
FOR
MENU
ACCELERATORS
TO
PROPERLY
SET
THE
USERS
EXPECTATIONS
BECAUSE
MENU
ACCELERATORS
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
THING
AS
TRANSLATIONS
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
SUPPLY
ACCELERATOR
FOR
A
MENU
ENTRY
IF
YOU
MEAN
MENU
ACCELERATOR
NO
ITS
NOT
POSSIBLE
THATS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
DEFINITION
OF
THE
XMNACCELERATOR
RESOURCE
IN
THE
XMLABEL
MANUAL
PAGE
KEEP
IN
MIND
WHEN
ANSWERING
THIS
QUESTION
THAT
WHEN
USING
MOTIF
YOU
CANT
USE
XTINSTALLACCELERATORS
I
CANT
THINK
OF
A
REASON
WHY
NOT
HOW
CAN
YOU
ENSURE
THAT
ACCELERATORS
WORK
THE
SAME
INDEPENDENT
OF
CASE
WHAT
I
WANT
IS
CTRLO
AND
CTRLO
TO
BOTH
BE
ACCELERATORS
ON
ONE
MENU
ENTRY
I
FIND
THIS
THREAD
ON
MOTIF
ACCELERATORS
ABSOULTLY
AMAZING
IF
I
WERE
WRITING
AN
INTERFACE
TO
KEYBOARD
ACCELERATORS
I
WOULD
HAVE
ONE
RESOURCE
CALLED
ACCELERATORS
THAT
TOOK
A
TRANSLATION
TABLE
PERIOD
I
WOULD
ALSO
IMPLEMENT
IT
SO
THAT
PROGRAMMER
NEVER
HAS
TO
DO
ANY
WORK
TO
GET
THE
ACCELERATORS
INSTALLED
AS
SOON
AS
THE
ENDUSER
SPECIFIED
ONE
IT
WOULD
BE
ACTIVE
AND
AUTOMATICALLY
INSTALLED
TO
GET
MULTIPLE
ACCELERATORS
ON
A
SINGLE
MENU
ITEM
ID
DO
SOMETHING
LIKE
MENUITEMACCELERATORS
OVERRIDE
N
CTRLKEYM
FIRE
N
SHIFTKEYL
FIRE
N
THE
ACCELERATORS
WOULD
WORK
EXACTLY
LIKE
TRANSLATIONS
AND
YOU
WOULD
AUTOMATICALLY
SEE
A
CTRL
M
SHOW
UP
IN
YOUR
MENUITEM
OBJECT
WHY
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
THE
MOTIF
STUFF
SO
COMPLICATED
WITH
SO
MANY
DIFFERENT
SPECIAL
CASES
DEPENDING
ON
WHAT
TYPE
OF
WIDGET
YOURE
DEALING
WITH
THERE
HAS
TO
BE
SOME
REASON
SORRY
FOR
THE
POLITICAL
TONE
OF
THIS
MESSAGE
