i
am
trying
to
use
xcopyplane
to
copy
a
single
plane
from
a
pixmap
to
a
pixmap
everytime
i
try
this
i
see
absolutely
nothing
displayed
i
know
there
is
data
in
the
pixmap
becuase
i
have
checked
by
doing
an
xcopyarea
to
the
screen
the
code
fragment
looks
reasonable
but
is
your
logic
valid
just
because
something
appears
in
an
bit
deep
pixmap
doesnt
mean
every
bit
plane
contains
data
did
you
try
each
plane
