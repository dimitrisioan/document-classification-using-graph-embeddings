due
it
seems
to
suns
crapulous
organisation
of
the
x
libraries
and
includes
most
standard
gnu
and
other
software
wont
compile
out
of
the
box
well
tar
file
right
now
im
trying
to
make
ghostview
it
complains
it
cant
find
so
i
just
linked
ln
s
the
files
from
and
now
the
ghoddam
thing
still
complains
it
cant
find
them
i
still
havent
been
able
to
compile
xdvi
not
no
way
has
anyone
ever
managed
to
get
anything
normal
to
compile
on
a
sun
sunos
and
openwindows
whats
the
trick
im
missing
ive
even
tried
hard
copying
all
the
relevant
files
into
the
right
places
and
every
time
theres
some
bit
missing
or
it
refuses
to
find
it
sounds
like
you
didnt
load
the
support
for
those
libraries
when
was
loaded
the
xaw
support
was
missing
from
but
added
in
harvard
ucbvaxuwvaxastroatcftmsbrown
or
rutgers
internet
brownwiextrelcom
or
ftmsbrownastroatcuucpcswiscedu
or
the
library
might
be
there
but
not
