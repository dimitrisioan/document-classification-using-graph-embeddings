LOOKING

HI
ALL
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
TIME
IVE
POSTED
TO
THE
NET
SO
I
HOPE
THIS
IS
GOING
TO
THE
RIGHT
PEOPLE
IM
LOOKING
FOR
SOFTWARE
PACKAGES
THAT
RUN
ON
AN
IBM
PC
CLONE
THAT
ALLOWS
ME
TO
DISPLAY
OPENLOOK
AND
MOTIF
WINDOWS
ON
THE
PC
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
USE
THE
PC
AS
A
CHEAP
X
WINDOWS
TERMINAL
FOR
USE
BY
PROCESS
ENGINEERS
AT
WORK
IF
YOU
ALREADY
OWN
ALL
THE
CLONE
EQUIPMENT
THEN
THERE
ARE
LOTS
OF
SUCH
PROGRAMS
SEE
A
CURRENT
COPY
OF
UNIX
WORLD
MAGAZINE
BUT
YOUR
PERFORMANCE
WILL
SUCK
LEMONS
RUNNING
AN
XSERVER
ON
A
CLONE
FROM
EXPERIENCE
YOU
WOULD
BE
MUCH
BETTER
OFF
WITH
AN
XTERMINAL
IF
THIS
IS
A
NEW
INSTALL
THE
PERFORMANCE
WILL
BE
AT
LEAST
FOUR
TIMES
BETTER
IN
ADDITION
IT
WOULD
BE
MUCH
EASIER
TO
INSTALL
AND
USE
ON
TOP
OF
THAT
THEY
WILL
COST
ABOUT
THE
SAME
PRICE
A
CLONE
WITH
RAM
ETHERNET
CARD
VERY
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
GRAPHICS
CARD
GOOD
MONITOR
SERVER
SOFTWARE
TCPIP
FOR
CLONE
SOFTWARE
MOUSE
KEYBOARD
ETC
ETC
ETC
YOU
SPEND
A
WHOLE
LOT
OF
I
CAN
GET
TEKTRONIX
TERMINALS
FOR
UNDER
AND
THE
PERFORMANCE
IS
OVER
XSTONES
