the
other
scary
thing
is
that
i
ship
libxclso
with
the
functions
in
it
how
many
other
libxclso
type
libraries
will
be
shipped
by
other
vendors
should
i
trademark
the
name
libxcla
what
if
some
clown
uses
that
name
and
only
puts
of
the
troublesome
functions
in
it
does
usl
support
ldrunpath
a
la
solaris
or
an
equivalent
if
so
you
can
put
the
library
in
a
package
specific
lib
directory
compile
the
app
with
ldrunpath
defined
and
all
should
work
besides
id
say
name
it
libpackagexcla
if
possible
