then
to
draw
i
do
xdrawline
mydisplay
xtwindow
gc
xflush
mydisplay
and
when
im
all
done
to
return
things
to
normal
i
do
xsetfunction
mydisplay
gc
gxcopy
what
id
like
to
happen
is
for
the
lines
i
draw
to
be
the
inverse
of
whatever
im
drawing
over
instead
what
happens
is
i
get
white
lines
if
the
lines
are
over
a
white
background
nothing
shows
up
if
the
lines
are
over
a
black
area
nothing
shows
up
its
very
strange
but
the
gxxor
function
seems
right
since
if
i
do
a
rubberbanding
box
it
erases
and
redraws
itself
correctly
ie
not
disturbing
the
underlying
image
any
suggestions
what
im
doing
wrong
david
try
change
the
gxxor
to
gxequiv
i
have
to
do
this
for
programs
that
are
to
run
on
ncd
terminals
on
sun
terminals
i
have
to
change
it
back
to
gxxor
there
is
a
small
section
in
the
oreilly
xlib
books
that
describes
the
right
thing
to
do
the
key
is
to
set
the
planemask
in
the
gc
to
the
or
of
the
foreground
and
background
pixel
values
