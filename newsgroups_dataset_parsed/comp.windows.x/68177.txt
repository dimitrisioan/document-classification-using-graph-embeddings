im
quite
familiar
with
a
variety
of
window
title
setting
methods
my
question
is
is
there
any
way
via
resources
etc
to
stop
an
applications
ability
to
rename
its
own
name
iconname
properties
sorry
thats
a
feature
the
icccm
specifies
how
the
app
should
set
its
title
so
the
wm
is
obliged
to
do
it
if
this
bothers
you
complain
to
the
app
writer
who
cares
if
its
not
nice
to
the
application
i
want
control
write
your
own
wm
that
doesnt
support
the
icccm
or
write
an
program
that
you
give
a
window
id
and
a
title
the
your
program
can
set
the
windows
title
for
the
app
and
then
if
the
app
changes
it
your
program
switches
it
back
again
