HEARING
OTHER
PEOPLES
STORIES
ON
THIS
I
HAVE
BEEN
BUILDING
WITH
GCC
SINCE
AND
THE
ONLY
TIME
I
HAD
TROUBLE
WAS
WHEN
THE
POSITION
INDEPENDANT
CODE
OPTION
BROKE
SO
I
COULDNT
USE
GCC
TO
BUILD
SUN
SHARED
LIBRARIES
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
TO
DO
IS
TO
FOLLOW
THE
TIPS
GIVEN
IN
THE
GCC
RELEASE
GCC
GENERATES
CODE
THAT
REQUIRES
AND
YOU
SHOULD
TAKE
THAT
INTO
ACCOUNT
WHEN
DECIDING
WHICH
COMPILER
TO
USE
FOR
THE
LIBRARIES
