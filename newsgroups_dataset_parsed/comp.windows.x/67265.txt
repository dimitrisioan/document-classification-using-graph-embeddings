CHANGING
COLORS
ON
A
LABEL
HELP
I
HAVE
A
TOGGLEBUTTON
WIDGET
YES
WIDGET
AND
I
HAVE
A
ROUTINE
WHICH
CHANGES
THE
COLOR
OF
THE
FOREGROUND
AND
BACKGROUND
OF
THE
LABEL
WELL
THE
BACKGROUND
CHANGES
ALRIGHT
BUT
THE
LABEL
TEXT
DOES
NOT
REDRAW
ITSELF
I
AM
GUESSING
THAT
I
HAVE
TO
FORCE
IT
TO
REDRAW
WITH
AN
XEXPOSEEVENT
SENT
TO
IT
VIA
XSENDEVENT
IS
THIS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
GET
THE
TEXT
UP
AGAIN
I
CANT
SEEEM
TO
GET
XSENDEVENT
TO
WORK
RIGHT
IF
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
APPROACH
MIGHT
ANYONE
HAVE
AN
EXAMPLE
LYING
AROUND
TO
SHOW
ME
HOW
TO
DO
THIS
IVE
RTFM
ALL
EVENING
AND
DID
NOT
FIND
A
DECENT
EXAMPLE
PS
I
KEEP
GETTING
SEGMENTATION
FAULTS
IN
XSENDEVENT
THO
ALL
THE
VALUES
ARE
AS
EXPECTED
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
