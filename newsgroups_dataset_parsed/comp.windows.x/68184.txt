detectingsaving
geometry
changes
hi
im
trying
to
get
my
program
to
monitor
resizeposition
events
so
that
when
the
program
exits
i
can
save
the
last
known
geometry
in
some
sort
of
preferences
file
i
am
adding
an
event
handler
for
structurenotify
to
the
toplevelshell
xtaddeventhandlertoplevelstructurenotifymaskfalseconfigurecbmydata
this
works
fine
and
my
callback
is
called
whenever
the
window
is
resized
or
repositioned
using
the
window
manager
mwm
however
when
im
just
resizing
the
window
using
any
resize
handle
on
the
window
manager
resize
decoration
the
x
and
y
are
set
to
zero
in
the
xevent
passed
to
the
event
handler
callback
im
accessing
the
xconfigure
structure
like
the
manual
says
xevxconfigurex
xevxconfigurey
the
width
and
height
memebers
are
correct
when
i
reposition
the
window
using
the
window
manager
the
xevents
xconfigure
structure
contains
all
the
correct
x
y
width
height
member
settings
anybody
know
why
when
just
resizing
the
x
and
y
are
being
set
to
zero
any
other
way
to
handle
detecting
and
saving
geometry
changes
ive
tried
using
xtgetvalues
on
the
toplevel
widget
when
exiting
my
application
before
destroying
any
widgets
and
all
i
get
is
garbage
values
for
the
x
y
width
height
resources
thanks
