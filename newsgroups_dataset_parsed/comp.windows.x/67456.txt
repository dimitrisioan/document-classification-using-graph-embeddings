hi
personally
i
like
nextstep
very
much
even
more
when
i
realise
how
much
a
burden
ordinary
x
or
windows
programming
is
i
also
like
objectivec
better
than
i
like
c
but
sometimes
the
restrictions
are
there
for
instance
it
sometimes
has
to
be
mswindows
or
x
now
im
looking
for
pointers
to
tools
on
those
environments
that
come
close
to
nextstep
the
appkit
etc
also
environs
that
support
rapid
prototyping
like
with
ib
without
producing
spaghetticode
as
soon
as
you
want
to
do
real
work
maybe
stepstone
with
some
windows
version
of
a
kit
of
ui
objects
interviews
what
it
is
exactly
i
dont
know
i
kind
of
lost
touch
with
that
world
when
i
started
with
nextstep
thanks
