HI
IM
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
TO
MAKE
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
PLACE
THE
WINDOW
WHERE
THE
CREATE
WINDOW
COMMAND
TELLS
IT
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
IT
MAY
THINK
IS
RIGHT
MY
APPLICATION
HAS
REASON
TO
KNOW
BETTER
I
DONT
WANT
TO
SET
THE
OVERRIDEREDIRECT
BECAUSE
I
DO
WANT
ALL
THE
EMBELLISHMENTS
THAT
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
GIVES
I
JUST
WANT
THE
WM
TO
ACCEPT
MY
CHOICE
OF
LOCATION
WHAT
IT
MAY
THINK
IS
RIGHT
MAY
BE
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
USER
WANTS
ASSUMING
THAT
YOUR
APPLICATION
HAS
REASON
TO
KNOW
BETTER
IS
IMHO
ANTISOCIAL
IF
I
START
YOUR
APPLICATION
WITH
A
GEOMETRY
OPTION
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
IGNORE
THAT
AS
WELL
THERES
REALLY
NO
WAY
TO
FORCE
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
TO
DO
MUCH
OF
ANYTHING
IF
ITS
MANAGING
YOUR
WINDOW
YOU
CAN
ASK
YOU
CAN
HINT
BUT
THERES
NO
GUARANTEE
THAT
YOURE
GOING
TO
GET
WHAT
YOU
WANT
