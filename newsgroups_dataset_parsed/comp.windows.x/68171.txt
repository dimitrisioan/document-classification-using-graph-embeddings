help
with
porting
screensaver
function
this
is
a
question
aimed
at
those
who
have
done
some
server
code
hacking
i
am
attempting
to
add
a
working
savescreen
function
to
a
new
server
i
have
been
able
to
get
the
screen
to
blank
out
properly
and
through
debugging
i
can
see
that
my
savescreen
function
is
being
called
with
which
for
some
arcane
reason
means
to
blank
the
screen
my
problem
is
that
this
function
is
never
being
called
again
with
even
after
i
have
moved
the
mouse
andor
typed
some
keys
my
question
is
what
am
i
likely
to
be
missing
that
would
cause
this
problem
i
copied
the
basic
design
of
my
function
from
the
existing
versions
static
bool
nextsavescreenscron
screenptr
scr
bool
on
this
was
copied
from
the
omron
server
code
is
it
the
right
way
if
on

nextsetlasteventtime
if

nxsetscreenbrightness
myeventhandle
blank
the
screen
else
unblank
the
screen
nxsetscreenbrightness
myeventhandle
nextsavescreenbrightness
return
true
i
can
see
in
the
serveros
code
where
the
screensaver
is
called
to
turn
on
the
saver
but
i
cannot
find
where
it
wakes
up
the
server
and
unblanks
the
screen
any
tipshelp
would
be
appreciated
thanks
