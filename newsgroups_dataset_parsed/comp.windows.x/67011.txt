xview
slider
hi
netters
im
using
sliders
in
my
xview
apps
usually
with
editable
numeric
field
but
i
seem
to
have
no
control
over
the
length
of
this
field
in
some
apps
it
appears
long
enough
to
keep
several
characters
in
some
it
cannot
keep
even
the
maximum
value
set
by
panelmaxvalue
as
i
understand
panelvaluedisplaylength
which
controls
number
of
characters
to
be
displayed
in
text
items
doesnt
work
in
the
case
of
slider
despite
the
fact
that
panelh
contains
the
following
bit
panelmultilinetextitem
panelnumerictextitem
panelslideritem
and
paneltextitem
attributes
panelnotifylevel
panelattrattrenum
panelvaluedisplaylength
panelattrattrint
which
gives
a
hint
that
this
attribute
can
be
used
for
sliders
but
setting
this
attribute
gives
nothing
and
xvgetting
this
attribute
gives
warning
bad
attribute
and
return
value
can
someone
share
his
experience
in
managing
sliders
in
xview
with
me
and
clear
this
problem
any
help
is
very
much
appreciated
