BUZZ

WRITES
POSTING
OF
THE
QUESTION
THAT
JUST
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
GET
ANSWERED
HOW
CAN
WE
RESIST
A
QUESTIONS
THAT
SAYS
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
THE
PROBLEM
OF
COURSE
IS
THAT
NO
EXPOSE
EVENT
IS
GENERATED
IF
THE
WINDOW
IS
ALREADY
VISIBLE
AND
MAPPED
WHAT
WE
NEED
TO
DO
IS
SOMEHOW
TICKLE
THE
WINDOW
SO
THAT
THE
EXPOSE
HANDLER
IS
HIT
WITH
ARGUMENTS
THAT
WILL
ENABLE
IT
TO
RENDER
JUST
THE
PART
OF
THE
WINDOW
THAT
CONTAINS
THE
NEW
ITEM
WHAT
IS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
TICKLE
A
WINDOW
TO
PRODUCE
THIS
BEHAVIOR
IF
YOUR
EXPOSE
EVENT
HANDLER
IS
TRULY
INTELLIGENT
ABOUT
EXPOSED
RECTANGLE
INFORMATION
THEN
YOU
CAN
USE
XCLEARAREA
TO
GENERATE
AN
EXPOSE
EVENT
ASSUMING
THAT
YOUR
BACKGROUND
PIXEL
IS
NOT
NONE
FOR
THE
ENCLOSING
RECTANGLE
OF
YOUR
NEW
ITEM
THIS
IS
STILL
NOT
GREAT
SINCE
ANY
OTHER
ITEMS
CONTAINED
WITHIN
THAT
RECTANGLE
WILL
STILL
BE
UNNECESSARILY
REDRAWN
IF
YOUR
EXPOSE
EVENT
HANDLER
SIMPLY
REDRAWS
EVERYTHING
YOULL
BE
DOING
MUCH
MORE
WORK
THAN
JUST
DRAWING
THE
NEW
ITEM
ON
TOP
OF
THE
EXISTING
