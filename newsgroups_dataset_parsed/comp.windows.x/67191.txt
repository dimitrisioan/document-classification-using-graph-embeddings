q
colormaps
with
dialog
shells
i
have
an
applicationshell
which
uses
a
colormap
created
with
xcreatecolormap
and
uses
all
of
the
colors
available
for
my
display
when
i
move
the
cursor
over
the
window
i
get
the
technicolor
effect
which
is
fine
basically
my
program
works
my
problemquestion
is
when
i
popup
a
dialogshell
to
prompt
the
user
for
some
input
i
want
the
xmndialogstyle
to
be
set
to
xmdialogprimaryapplicationmodal
the
result
is
that
if
my
cursor
is
over
the
dialogshell
i
get
my
colormap
but
if
the
cursor
is
over
the
applicationshell
or
any
window
other
than
the
dialogshell
i
get
the
default
colormap
but
id
like
it
so
that
if
my
cursor
is
over
any
window
of
my
application
i
get
my
colormap
any
suggestions
thanks
david
