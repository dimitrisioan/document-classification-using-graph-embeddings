icon
animation
hi
folks
as
part
of
my
selfintroduction
to
x
ive
been
trying
to
do
some
simple
icon
animation
sort
of
like
icondoit
from
mswindows
changing
your
own
applications
icon
is
fairly
simple
if
you
have
a
widget
id
you
can
just
xtsetvalues
on
xtniconifypixmap
or
whatever
and
youre
done
alternately
you
can
set
window
manager
hints
these
methods
dont
seem
to
work
with
icons
which
your
application
doesnt
specifically
own
in
my
situation
i
have
to
change
the
icon
of
random
windows
sitting
there
in
my
icon
box
so
my
question
is
given
a
windowid
how
do
you
change
the
icon
pixure
a
working
example
would
be
very
much
appreciated
if
it
makes
any
difference
im
using
motif
on
vms
thanks
scott
