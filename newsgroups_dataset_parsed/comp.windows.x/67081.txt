mouse
is
moved
across
screen
horizontally
the
sprite
goes
off
of
the
edge
of
the
screen
and
reappears
at
the
other
edge
it
appears
that
the
server
thinks
we
are
running
in
multiscreen
mode
the
cursor
seems
to
wrap
from
one
side
of
the
screen
to
the
other
as
far
as
we
can
tell
we
are
not
running
the
server
in
multiscreen
mode
