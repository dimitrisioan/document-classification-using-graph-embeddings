i
can
also
live
with
a
utility
that
converts
postscript
to
plain
text
perferably
retaining
page
counts
so
that
i
know
how
many
pages
the
original
document
contains
well
i
know
of
one
hack
to
sort
of
do
this
conversion
first
get
ghostscript
and
check
out
the
file
that
comes
with
it
it
prints
out
some
information
about
where
each
text
string
goes
on
the
page
and
maintains
page
counts
ive
written
a
little
c
program
to
massage
the
output
of
gs
dnodisplay
somewhat
so
that
you
can
get
all
the
ascii
strings
in
the
document
no
guarantees
that
it
wont
break
up
wordssentences
though
ive
used
it
with
varying
degrees
of
success
anyways
try
this
out
it
may
do
what
you
want
