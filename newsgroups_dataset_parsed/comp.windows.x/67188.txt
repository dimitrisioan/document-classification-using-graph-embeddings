writing
a
motif
widget
can
anyone
give
me
some
information
please
i
need
probably
to
write
one
or
more
new
motif
widgets
on
the
hpux
platform
do
i
need
the
motif
private
header
files
and
source
or
can
i
make
do
with
the
public
headers
that
are
provided
motif
includes
xt
in
this
context
one
widget
is
a
multicolumn
list
which
lots
of
people
have
already
written
i
am
sure
and
would
therefore
be
probably
be
a
subclass
of
list
rather
than
something
simple
like
an
xt
class
is
this
more
difficult
in
principle
not
lines
of
code
alternatively
if
anyone
has
a
multicolumn
list
widget
they
could
sell
me
this
might
save
me
from
having
to
write
one
does
it
by
any
chance
exist
in
motif
already
i
do
not
yet
have
the
spec
