re
static
color
will
clients
like
it
even
truecolor
machines
are
in
most
cases
running
an
emulated
bit
pseudocolor
visual
only
to
get
standard
x
clients
motif
apps
and
thelike
to
run
i
strongly
suppose
you
to
emulate
at
least
bit
truecolor
should
be
no
problem
only
some
translation
rounding
should
not
make
big
misfits
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
rounding
x
allows
the
user
to
do
bit
arithmetic
on
pixel
values
ie
xor
foreground
and
backgroun
pixel
values
together
to
calculate
a
foreground
color
that
when
used
with
a
function
of
gxxor
fill
change
foreground
to
background
and
viceversa
if
your
rounding
does
not
preserve
these
types
of
calculations
then
clients
that
use
them
will
break
