THE
SHELL
IS
WAITING
FOR
THE
WINDOWMANAGER
TO
RESPOND
TO
ITS
POSITIONING
REQUEST
THE
WINDOWMANAGER
IS
NOT
RESPONDING
BECAUSE
IT
THINKS
THE
WINDOW
IS
ALREADY
IN
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
EXACTLY
WHY
THE
TWO
COMPONENTS
GET
INTO
THIS
SULK
IS
UNCLEAR
TO
ME
ALL
INFORMATION
GREATLY
RECEIVED
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
CAUSED
BY
A
BAD
INTERACTION
BETWEEN
THE
WAY
OLWM
REPARENTS
WINDOWS
A
MISFEATURE
OF
THE
X
PROTOCOL
AND
A
BUG
IN
THE
XT
INTRINSICS
THE
INTRINSICS
BUG
IS
THAT
IT
IGNORES
THE
XY
POSITION
GIVEN
IN
REPARENTNOTIFY
EVENTS
OLWM
IS
STRUCTURED
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
WHEN
A
WINDOW
IS
POPPED
DOWN
THE
LAST
EVENT
THE
CLIENT
RECEIVES
IS
A
REPARENTNOTIFY
EVENT
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
INTRINSICS
NOTION
OF
THE
SHELLS
LOCATION
IS
OUT
OF
DATE
IF
A
SETVALUES
IS
DONE
USING
THE
SAME
XY
POSITION
THE
INTRINSICS
THINKS
IT
NEEDS
TO
MOVE
THE
SHELL
SO
IT
ISSUES
A
CONFIGUREWINDOW
REQUEST
TO
MOVE
IT
THERE
HOWEVER
A
MISFEATURE
OF
THE
X
PROTOCOL
IS
THAT
A
CONFIGUREWINDOW
REQUEST
THAT
HAS
NO
EFFECT
WILL
GENERATE
NO
CONFIGURENOTIFY
EVENT
THE
INTRINSICS
THUS
WAITS
FOR
AN
EVENT
THAT
WILL
NEVER
ARRIVE
AND
TIMES
OUT
AFTER
WMTIMEOUT
HAS
EXPIRED
ACTUALLY
THINGS
ARE
SOMEWHAT
MORE
COMPLEX
BECAUSE
THE
REQUEST
IS
REDIRECTED
TO
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
BUT
THE
NET
RESULT
IS
THE
SAME
THE
SOLUTION
IS
FOR
THE
INTRINSICS
TO
NOTE
THE
XY
POSITIONING
INFORMATION
IN
REPARENTNOTIFY
EVENTS
THIS
HAS
BEEN
IMPLEMENTED
AND
IS
AVAILABLE
IN
PUBLIC
FIX
THIS
IS
XBUG
