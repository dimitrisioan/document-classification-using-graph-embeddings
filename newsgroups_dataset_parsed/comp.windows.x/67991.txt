PAINTING
WITH
INCREASING
RESOLUTION
SOME
PEOPLE
WORKING
A
FEW
CUBES
OVER
HAVE
COME
UP
WITH
THIS
NEED
AND
IT
SEEMS
THAT
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
JUST
MIGHT
HAVE
DONE
IT
ALREADY
AND
CAN
POINT
ME
TO
SOME
TOOLS
THAT
WOULD
HELP
WHAT
THEYD
LIKE
TO
DO
IS
GIVEN
A
WINDOW
THAT
IS
TAKING
A
LONG
TIME
TO
DRAW
BECAUSE
EITHER
THE
DATA
IS
ARRIVING
OVER
A
SLOW
LINK
OR
THE
DISPLAY
IS
ACROSS
A
SLOW
LINK
THEY
WOULD
LIKE
TO
FIRST
PAINT
A
LOWRESOLUTION
VERSION
OF
THE
PICTURE
AND
THEN
REPAINT
IT
IN
HIGHER
RESOLUTION
THUS
THE
PICTURE
MIGHT
FIRST
BE
GENERATED
IN
RESOLUTION
WITH
EACH
SQUARE
OF
PIXELS
BEING
FILLED
IN
WITH
A
SINGLE
COLOR
NEXT
EACH
SQUARE
WOULD
BE
REPLACED
BY
SQUARES
FINALLY
THE
VERSION
WOULD
BE
PAINTED
SINCE
ONE
OF
THE
SCENARIOS
IS
WITH
THE
WINDOW
BEING
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
A
SLOW
LINK
THE
LOWRES
VERSION
OBVIOUSLY
WOULDNT
BE
TRANSMITTED
AS
A
BITMAP
THAT
WOULDNT
HELP
AT
ALL
INSTEAD
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
A
PROCESS
ON
THE
FAR
END
THAT
RECEIVES
THE
LOWRES
PICTURE
AS
A
SMALL
BITMAP
AND
BLOWS
UP
EACH
PIXEL
INTO
A
SQUARE
SORTA
LIKE
THE
MAGNIFIER
PROGRAMS
DO
THIS
BRINGS
UP
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
THE
X
SERVER
CAN
HELP
THAT
IS
WHEN
A
WINDOW
IS
OPENED
IS
THERE
A
WAY
TO
ASK
THAT
A
FILTER
PROGRAM
BE
RUN
TO
PROCESS
THE
PIXELS
OR
IS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
USE
SOMETHING
LIKE
RSH
TO
START
UP
A
REMOTE
PROCESS
PERMISSION
DENIED
AND
HAVE
IT
OPEN
A
LOCAL
WINDOW
IT
SEEMS
THE
MOST
LIKELY
SCENARIO
IS
A
LIBRARY
ROUTINE
THAT
STARTS
UP
SUCH
A
PROGRAM
REMOTELY
AND
THEN
ACCEPTS
BITMAPS
COMPRESSING
EACH
ONE
BY
SOME
AMOUNT
AND
SENDING
THEM
TO
THE
REMOTE
PROGRAM
TO
EXPAND
BUT
IF
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
X
ITSELF
CAN
DO
TO
HELP
ITS
BE
NICE
TO
HEAR
ABOUT
IT
I
LOOKED
IN
SEVERAL
FMS
BUT
IF
ITS
THERE
I
OBVIOUSLY
DONT
KNOW
THE
KEYWORDS
IF
SOMEONE
HAS
A
NIFTY
TOOL
AVAILABLE
THAT
PACKAGES
IT
ALL
WE
MIGHT
WANT
TO
GET
A
COPY
OH
YES
THIS
IS
TO
RUN
ON
SOME
SUNS
PART
OF
THE
IDEA
IS
TO
BUILD
DEMOS
THAT
CAN
SHOW
SUCH
THINGS
AS
IF
THIS
WERE
RUN
ACROSS
SAY
A
LINK
THIS
IS
HOW
FAST
THE
PICTURES
WOULD
APPEAR
THEN
THE
CUSTOMER
WOULD
GET
A
FEEL
FOR
THE
SPEED
THAT
THEY
NEED
TO
PAY
FOR
IF
THE
AUTO
INDUSTRY
WERE
LIKE
THE
COMPUTER
INDUSTRY
A
CAR
WOULD
NOW
COST
WOULD
GET
MILES
TO
THE
GALLON
AND
AT
RANDOM
TIMES
WOULD
EXPLODE
KILLING
ALL
ITS
PASSENGERS
