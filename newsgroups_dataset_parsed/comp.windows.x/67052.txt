FOR
A
FRIEND
OKAY
I
LOOKED
THROUGH
THE
FAQS
AND
DIDNT
SEE
THIS
BUT
I
KNOW
ITS
COME
UP
BEFORE
XALLOCCOLOR
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
THE
FOLLOWING
IN
ORDER
TRY
TO
FIND
AN
EXACT
MATCH
READONLY
COLOR
CELL
WITHIN
HARDWARE
LIMITS
TRY
TO
ALLOCATE
A
READONLY
COLORCELL
AND
SET
IT
TO
MATCH
AND
WHEN
ALL
ELSE
FAILS
RETURN
THE
COLORCELL
WITH
THE
BEST
MATCH
FROM
THE
READONLY
COLORS
ALREADY
ALLOCATED
IN
THE
COLORMAP
THIS
SOUNDS
GOOD
IN
THEORY
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
WORK
THIS
WAY
THOUGH
IF
THERE
IS
NO
EXACT
MATCH
ALREADY
IN
THE
COLORMAP
AND
NO
UNALLOCATED
CELLS
THEN
XALLOCCOLOR
FAILS
EVEN
WHEN
IT
HAS
ALREADY
ALLOCATED
SEVERAL
OTHER
CELLS
ALREADY
AND
THERE
ARE
DOZENS
OF
READONLY
CELLS
ALREADY
IN
THE
COLORMAP
IS
THIS
A
BUG
A
FEATURE
A
MISUNDERSTANDING
ON
MY
PART
