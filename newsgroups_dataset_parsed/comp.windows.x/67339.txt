FREDERICK
ROEBER
WRITES
IM
WRITING
AN
X
SERVER
FOR
SOME
VIDEOGENERATION
EQUIPMENT
THE
HARDWARE
IS
TRUECOLOR
IN
YUV
SPACE
IN
X
TERMS
IT
HAS
A
STATIC
COLOR
VISUAL
I
WOULD
REALLY
LIKE
TO
HAVE
THE
SERVER
JUST
PRESENT
THIS
STATIC
VISUAL
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
WILL
BE
ACCEPTABLE
TO
MOST
X
CLIENTS
THE
THREE
PROBLEMS
I
SEE
ARE
THE
COLORMAP
THOUGH
HUGE
IS
STATIC
ALL
PIXELS
WOULD
BE
BYTES
WIDE
BECAUSE
THE
HARDWARE
ACTUALLY
LIVES
IN
YUV
SPACE
THE
TRANSLATION
RGBYUV
WILL
INTRODUCE
SOME
ROUNDING
ERROR
WE
TRIED
TO
SHIP
AN
X
SERVER
ONCE
THAT
ONLY
SUPPORTED
A
TRUECOLOR
VISUAL
THE
MAIN
PROBLEMS
WE
ENCOUNTERED
WERE
CLIENTS
WRITTEN
WITH
LOGIC
LIKE
THE
FOLLOWING
IF
DEFAULTDEPTH
ASSUME
DEFAULT
DEPTH
IS
THESE
CLIENTS
NEED
AN
DEEP
VISUAL
IN
THE
ROOT
WINDOW
TO
RUN
CORRECTLY
OTHER
CLIENTS
DIDNT
EVEN
BOTHER
TO
DO
THAT
MUCH
AND
JUST
OUTRIGHT
ASSUMED
THEY
HAD
A
DYNAMIC
VISUAL
CLASS
WITH
A
DYNAMIC
COLORMAP
XSTORECOLORS
DOESNT
WORK
ON
CMAPS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
STATIC
OR
TRUECOLOR
VISUAL
CLASSES
BUT
MANY
CLIENTS
DONT
BOTHER
TO
CHECK
THEY
JUST
START
THROWING
XSTORECOLOR
CALLS
AT
YOU
THOUGH
BOTH
ARE
CLEARLY
CLIENT
ERROR
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
WITH
SO
MANY
CLIENTS
THAT
ITS
EASIER
FOR
YOU
TO
EXPOSE
PSEUDOCOLOR
AS
A
DEFAULT
ROOT
WINDOW
VISUAL
THAN
IT
EVER
WOULD
BE
FOR
ALL
THESE
CLIENT
WRITERS
TO
CHANGE
THEIR
CLIENTS
TO
DO
THE
RIGHT
THING
