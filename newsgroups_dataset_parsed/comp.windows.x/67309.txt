STATIC
COLOR
WILL
CLIENTS
LIKE
IT
IM
WRITING
AN
X
SERVER
FOR
SOME
VIDEOGENERATION
EQUIPMENT
THE
HARDWARE
IS
TRUECOLOR
IN
YUV
SPACE
IN
X
TERMS
IT
HAS
A
STATIC
COLOR
VISUAL
I
WOULD
REALLY
LIKE
TO
HAVE
THE
SERVER
JUST
PRESENT
THIS
STATIC
VISUAL
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
WILL
BE
ACCEPTABLE
TO
MOST
X
CLIENTS
THE
THREE
PROBLEMS
I
SEE
ARE
THE
COLORMAP
THOUGH
HUGE
IS
STATIC
ALL
PIXELS
WOULD
BE
BYTES
WIDE
BECAUSE
THE
HARDWARE
ACTUALLY
LIVES
IN
YUV
SPACE
THE
TRANSLATION
RGBYUV
WILL
INTRODUCE
SOME
ROUNDING
ERROR
BEING
MORE
OF
A
SERVER
GUY
THAN
A
CLIENT
GUY
I
ASK
WILL
THESE
LIMITATIONS
THWART
MANY
X
CLIENTS
OR
WILL
MOST
OF
THE
X
STUFF
FLOATING
AROUND
BLITHELY
ACCEPT
WHAT
THEYRE
GIVEN
I
COULD
WRITE
THE
SERVER
TO
ALSO
PRESENT
A
PSEUDOCOLOR
VISUAL
OF
EG
BITS
BUT
ID
RATHER
AVOID
THIS
IF
NOT
NECESSARY
I
KNOW
THERE
ARE
NO
ABSOLUTES
BUT
ID
APPRECIATE
HEARING
PEOPLES
OPINIONS
AND
SUGGESTIONS
