MAKEDEPEND
PROBLEM
HI
NETTERS
WE
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
MAKEDEPEND
IT
DOESNT
KNOW
HOW
TO
CORRECTLY
PROCESS
IF
CLAUSE
IN
C
PREPROCESSOR
STATEMENTS
IT
EVALUATES
EVERYTHING
TO
TRUE
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THE
CONDITIONALS
ARE
FOR
EXAMPLE
MAKEDEPEND
CHOKES
ON
ONE
OF
INCLUDE
FILES
AS
DISTRIBUTED

ENDIF
STDC
HERE
MAKEDEPEND
EVALUATES
BOTH
IF

CORRESPONDING
ELSE
STATEMENTS
TO
TRUE
AND
TRIES
TO
OPEN
THE
FILE
STRINGSH
WHICH
DOESNT
EXIST
UNDER
WE
ALSO
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
IF
STATEMENTS
IN
SOME
OF
OUR
LEGACY
CODE
WE
GOT

BUILT
MAKEDEPEND
OFF
THE

IT
DIDNT

THE

IN

IT

IF

THE
BERKELEY
C
PREPROCESSOR
THEN
MAKEDEPEND
WILL
BE
COMPILED
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
ALL
IF
DIRECTIVES
WILL
EVALUATE
TO
TRUE
REGARDLESS
OF
THEIR
ACTUAL
VALUE
THIS
MAY
CAUSE
THE
WRONG
INCLUDE
DIRECTIVES
TO
BE
EVALUATED
MAKEDEPEND
