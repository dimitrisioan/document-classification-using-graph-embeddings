makedepend
problem
hi
netters
we
have
a
problem
with
makedepend
it
doesnt
know
how
to
correctly
process
if
clause
in
c
preprocessor
statements
it
evaluates
everything
to
true
no
matter
what
the
conditionals
are
for
example
makedepend
chokes
on
one
of
include
files
as
distributed
by
sun
namely
xosh
if
definedstdc
include
stringh
define
index
strchr
define
rindex
strrchr
else
bsd
stdc
include
stringsh
endif
stdc
here
makedepend
evaluates
both
if
and
corresponding
else
statements
to
true
and
tries
to
open
the
file
stringsh
which
doesnt
exist
under
we
also
have
a
lot
of
if
statements
in
some
of
our
legacy
code
we
got
and
built
makedepend
off
the
net
it
didnt
fix
the
problem
in
all
fairness
it
should
be
noted
that
makdepend
manpage
suns
distribution
mentions
this
problem
bugs
if
you
do
not
have
the
source
for
cpp
the
berkeley
c
preprocessor
then
makedepend
will
be
compiled
in
such
a
way
that
all
if
directives
will
evaluate
to
true
regardless
of
their
actual
value
this
may
cause
the
wrong
include
directives
to
be
evaluated
makedepend
should
simply
have
its
own
parser
written
for
if
expressions
has
anybody
come
up
with
some
solutionfix
to
makdepend
other
than
writeyourownparser
and
willing
to
share
it
with
us
since
we
often
experience
delays
in
our
newsfeed
please
reply
directly
to
my
email
address
ill
post
a
summary
thanks
in
advance
