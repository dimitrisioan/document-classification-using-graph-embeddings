I
USE
DESQVIEWX
AND
I
THINK
IT
IS
GREAT
WHERE
IT
REALLY
SHINES
IMHO
IS
TO
LET
UNIX
USERS
LOG
INTO
A
PC
AND
RUN
DOS
AND
WINDOWS
APPLICATIONS
WITH
THE
DISPLAY
GOING
TO
THEIR
SCREENS
YOULL
NEED

IN
MY
OPINION
IF

YOULL
WANT
TO
HAVE
A
WITH

ALSO
THE

IN
DESQVIEWX
REALLY
SEEMS

CARD
PERSONALLY
I
FOUND
THAT
THINGS
RAN
BETTER
WITH
A
SCSI
DRIVE
IN
THE
PC
THAN
WITH
ESDI
DRIVES
BUT
THAT
IS
MY
EXPERIENCE
ONLY
GOOD
LUCK
AND
BEST
WISHES
PHIL
WHAT
SORT
OF
TRAFFIC
IS
GENERATED
WITH
THE

I
AM
CURIOUS
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
REQUIRED
BANDWIDTH
THAT
A
LINK
MUST
HAVE
IF
ONE
MACHINE
RUNNING
DVX
IS
SUPPORTING
MULTIPLE

AND
WE
REQUIRE
ADEQUATE

ANYONE
