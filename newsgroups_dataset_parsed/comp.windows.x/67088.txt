help
setting
colormaps
on
multitoplevel
app
dear
sgi
and
netter
glx
mixedmodel
experts
i
am
writing
a
mixed
model
application
that
creates
a
couple
different
color
maps
for
different
windows
and
ive
been
having
trouble
getting
the
window
manager
to
reliably
honor
my
requests
in
some
environments
entry
level
indigo
w
all
windows
are
getting
properly
connected
to
their
designated
color
maps
but
on
others
an
iris
also
a
different
entry
level
indigo
the
color
mapping
is
unreliable
and
changes
behavior
when
i
compile
at
different
times
the
most
common
problem
is
that
all
nontoplevel
windows
fail
to
be
displayed
according
to
their
colormap
my
application
starts
out
by
creating
three
toplevel
windows
in
some
cases
all
but
the
first
of
these
also
fail
to
be
displayed
by
their
colormap
this
is
spectacularly
aggravating
i
would
dearly
appreciate
an
explanation
of
the
standard
right
correct
way
to
give
a
window
a
colormap
such
that
the
window
manager
will
honor
and
obey
it
any
advice
about
problems
that
could
cause
my
failure
to
get
my
desired
colormaps
by
now
i
have
exhausted
my
own
attempts
on
this
having
tried
everything
reasonable
or
imaginable
below
is
example
code
giving
the
schematic
for
how
i
have
been
trying
to
do
this
please
please
please
somebody
tell
me
what
i
am
doing
wronghow
to
do
it
right

does
anyone
know
if
setting

is
by

is
