re
wanted
info
on
dedicated
x
server
kernel
for
series
if
anyone
has
any
information
about
the
existence
or
location
of
a
dedicated
x
server
kernel
for
the
please
send
email
i
am
trying
to
put
some
neglected
to
good
use
but
they
dont
have
enough
memory
for
sunos
thanks
in
advance
for
any
help
there
is
a
free
program
called
xkernel
which
does
just
that
it
is
by
seth
robertson
sethctrcolumbiaedu
it
takes
a
sun
and
boots
a
limited
kernel
which
allows
you
to
run
x
we
converted
machines
over
this
semester
and
the
speedup
is
enormously
appreciable
i
find
them
faster
than
an
ncd
blackwhite
xterminal
that
we
are
playing
with
and
a
bigger
screen
to
boot
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
department
just
bought
some
old
at
an
auction
to
convert
xkernel
is
available
for
anonymous
ftp
from
ftpctrcolumbiaedu
in
xkernelxkernelshar
xkernel
is
a
symlink
to
the
latest
version
of
xkernel
note
that
the
compiled
version
which
is
available
is
for
the
sun
but
compiling
to
work
for
a
sun
should
be
quite
easy
i
am
not
connected
with
xkernel
except
as
a
satisfied
installer
and
user
i
may
be
able
to
answer
questions
feel
free
