i
have
an
application
that
wants
to
walk
the
server
window
hierarchy
looking
for
a
window
with
a
specific
property
i
think
what
happens
is
that
xquerytree
gives
me
an
array
of
n
children
but
by
the
time
i
get
to
the
nth
child
window
it
has
been
destroyed
then
i
get
a
badwindow
error
and
my
application
exits
how
can
i
make
this
robust
ive
thought
of
the
following
set
up
an
x
error
handler
that
longjmps
back
to
where
i
made
the
offending
call
is
this
safe
do
i
have
to
longjmp
or
can
i
just
return
badwindow
is
an
x
protocol
error
if
you
write
a
custom
error
handler
which
does
not
do
the
error
handler
will
return
and
let
your
program
carry
on
so
using
a
xseterrorhandler
is
the
way
to
go
but
never
mind
the
longjmp
register
for
destroynotify
on
all
the
windows
returned
from
xquerytree
too
hard
