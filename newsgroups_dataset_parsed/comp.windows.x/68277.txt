JOSH

WRITES
I
HAVE
AN
APPLICATION
THAT
WANTS
TO
WALK
THE
SERVER
WINDOW
HIERARCHY
LOOKING
FOR
A
WINDOW
WITH
A
SPECIFIC
PROPERTY
I
THINK
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
XQUERYTREE
GIVES
ME
AN
ARRAY
OF
N
CHILDREN
BUT
BY
THE
TIME
I
GET
TO
THE
NTH
CHILD
WINDOW
IT
HAS
BEEN
DESTROYED
THEN
I
GET
A
BADWINDOW
ERROR
AND
MY
APPLICATION
EXITS
HOW
CAN
I
MAKE
THIS
ROBUST
IVE
THOUGHT
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
SET
UP
AN
X
ERROR
HANDLER
THAT
LONGJMPS
BACK
TO
WHERE
I
MADE
THE
OFFENDING
CALL
IS
THIS
SAFE
DO
I
HAVE
TO
LONGJMP
OR
CAN
I
JUST
RETURN
BADWINDOW
IS
AN
X
PROTOCOL
ERROR
IF
YOU
WRITE
A
CUSTOM
ERROR
HANDLER
WHICH
DOES
NOT
DO
THE
ERROR
HANDLER
WILL
RETURN
AND
LET
YOUR
PROGRAM
CARRY
ON
SO
USING
A
XSETERRORHANDLER
IS
THE
WAY
TO
GO
BUT
NEVER
MIND
THE
LONGJMP
REGISTER
FOR
DESTROYNOTIFY
ON
ALL
THE
WINDOWS
RETURNED
FROM
XQUERYTREE
TOO
HARD
