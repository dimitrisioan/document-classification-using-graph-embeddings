ftpunixdosunix
im
an
new
to
this
having
found
some
files
public
to
look
into
i
ftped
them
to
a
system
i
have
access
to
i
then
used
kermit
to
transmit
them
via
modem
to
my
host
computer
a
pcbased
file
system
i
access
internet
through
modem
access
to
a
university
mainframe
from
the
pc
file
server
i
pull
the
files
to
a
disk
and
then
pull
them
from
disk
to
a
sgi
indigo
the
sgi
is
not
networked
yet
when
i
try
to
uncompress
and
untar
the
files
they
either
come
out
as
garbage
or
i
get
an
error
in
the
tar
process
about
directories
being
invalid
what
im
wondering
about
is
the
transfer
of
unix
files
compressed
binaryascii
about
multiple
platforms
my
guess
is
that
it
is
the
copy
to
a
dos
disk
that
is
screwing
things
up
any
help
is
appreciated
