my
question
is
this
is
there
a
means
of
determining
what
the
state
of
capslock
andor
numlock
is
alright
ignore
this
i
have
delved
a
bit
deeper
xkeyevent
and
found
what
i
was
looking
for
evstate
has
a
bunch
of
masks
to
check
against
lockmask
is
the
one
for
capslock
unfortunately
it
appears
that
the
numlock
mask
varies
from
server
to
server
how
does
one
tell
what
mask
is
numlock
and
which
are
for
meta
eg
sgis
vendor
server
has
being
numlock
whereas
solaris
openwindows
has
for
numlock
is
there
an
unambiguous
means
of
determining
numlocks
mask
at
runtime
for
any
given
server
sorry
for
the
wasted
bandwidth
and
my
appalling
ignorance
youll
have
to
check
the
keysyms
on
each
of
the
keys
for
each
modifier
the
one
with
numlock
in
its
mapping
is
the
modifier
you
want
a
bit
ugly
perhaps
but
i
think
its
currently
the
only
way
to
do
this
and
it
does
have
some
precedent
as
keysyms
are
used
to
differentiate
capslock
from
shiftlock
for
the
lock
modifier
i
dont
know
of
an
accepted
strategy
for
handling
ambiguous
assignments
either
ie
what
if
numlock
is
mapped
for
more
then
one
modifier
i
suppose
first
found
is
as
good
as
any
x
doesnt
handle
locking
modifiers
that
well
hope
that
helps
