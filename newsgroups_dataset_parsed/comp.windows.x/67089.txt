HELLO
NETLANDERS
I
AM
A
NOVICE
X
USER
WITH
A
QUESTION
FOR
ANY
XGOD
MY
COMPUTER
CONFIGURATION
WITH
THE
X
PROBLEM
IS
AS
FOLLOWS
RUNNING
ESIX
WANGTEK
ATSTYLE
INTERFACE
M
TAPE
DRIVE
I
HAVE
LOADED
THE
BASIC
OS
WHICH
INCLUDES
NSU
AND
INET
UTILITIES
TCPIP
I
FTPED
THE
BINARIES
AND
INSTALLED
PROPERLY
I
CAN
EXECUTE
STARTX
AND
RUN
XWINDOWS
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
HOWEVER
IF
I
TRY
TO
ACCESS
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
WHILE
IN
X
THE
MACHINE
LOCKS
UP
INSTANTLY
IF
I
AM
OUT
OF
X
AND
ACCESS
THE
TAPE
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
WORKS
FINE
SOON
AS
I
TRY
TO
STARTX
AGAIN
THE
SCREEN
CHANGES
MODES
BUT
THE
GREY
BACKGROUND
PATTERN
DOES
NOT
COME
UP
AND
NO
XTERM
IS
FORKED
I
HAVE
TO
LOGIN
FROM
ANOTHER
TERMINAL
AND
EXECUTE
A
SHUTDOWN
TO
RESET
THE
SYSTEM
IVE
CONTACTED
ESIX
ABOUT
THIS
PROBLEM
THEY
CLAIM
THEIR
XWINDOW
SERVER
WHICH
I
HAVE
WORKS
WITH
THE
WANGTEK
TAPE
DRIVE
THEY
ALSO
CLAIM
I
ONLY
NEED
THE
NSU
NETWORK
SYSTEM
UTILITIES
TO
RUN
X
I
DONT
NEED
INET
TCPIP
MY
EXPERIENCE
HAS
BEEN
THAT
I
NEED
BOTH
TO
GET
TO
WORK
IM
NOT
TOO
CONCERNED
ABOUT
HAVING
TO
LOAD
BOTH
NSU
AND
INET
PACKAGES
TO
GET
X
TO
WORK
UNLESS
THE
INET
PACKAGE
IS
CAUSING
MY
PROBLEM
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
BOTH
X
AND
MY
TAPE
DRIVE
TO
COEXIST
ON
THE
SAME
SYSTEM
IF
YOU
CAN
SHED
ANY
LIGHT
ON
THE
PROBLEM
IT
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
ONE
COLLEAGUE
IMPLIED
THIS
MIGHT
BE
A
HARDWARE
CONFLICT
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
WHAT
DIRECTION
SHOULD
I
LOOK
TO
RESOLVE
THE
CONFLICT
