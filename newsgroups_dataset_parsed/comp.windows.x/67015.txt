FOR
X
IS
THERE
AYTHING
AVAILABLE
FOR
X
SIMILAR
TO
QUICKEYS
FOR
THE
MACINTOSH
SOMETHING
THAT
WILL
ALLOW
ME
TO
STORE
AND
PLAYBACK
SEQUENCES
OF
KEYSTROKES
MENU
SELECTIONS
AND
MOUSE
ACTIONS
DIRECTING
THEM
TOWARDS
ANOTHER
APPLICATION
IF
SO
COULD
SOMEONE
SEND
ME
INFORMATION
ON
ITS
AVAILABILITY
AND
IF
NOT
HOW
HARD
DO
WE
THINK
IT
MIGHT
BE
TO
SEND
INPUT
TO
OTHER
X
APPLICATIONS
AND
HOPEFULLY
DEAL
WITH
THEIR
RESPONSES
APPROPRIATELY
IF
AN
APPLICATION
IS
GOING
TO
TAKE
A
FEW
SECONDS
TO
PROCESS
I
PROBABLY
HAVE
TO
WAIT
FOR
IT
TO
COMPLETE
BEFORE
SENDING
ANOTHER
COMMAND
THANKS
