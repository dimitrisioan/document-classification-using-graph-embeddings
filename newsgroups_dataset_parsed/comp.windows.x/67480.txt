WHAT
SORT
OF
TRAFFIC
IS
GENERATED
WITH
THE
XCALLS
I
AM
CURIOUS
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
REQUIRED
BANDWIDTH
THAT
A
LINK
MUST
HAVE
IF
ONE
MACHINE
RUNNING
DVX
IS
SUPPORTING
MULTIPLE
USERS
CLIENTS
AND
WE
REQUIRE
ADEQUATE
RESPONSE
TIME
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEAS
I
EXPECT
THE
LIMITING
FACTOR
WILL
BE
YOUR
SERVER
MACHINE
NOT
THE
NETWORK
ITSELF
TO
GIVE
YOU
A
REALWORLD
EXAMPLE
HERE
AT
QUARTERDECK
WE
HAVE
ROUGHLY
PEOPLE
USING
DVX
TO
TALK
TO
A
BUNCH
OF
UNIX
BOXES
NOVELL
FILE
SERVERS
AND
EACH
OTHER
ITS
NOT
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
LOAD
ON
OUR
ETHERNET
WITH
MAYBE
CONCENTRATORS
SO
YOU
HAVE
PEOPLE
ON
EACH
SEGMENT
IF
YOU
HAD
A
BADLY
LOADED
NET
OR
THE
APPS
YOU
WANTED
TO
RUN
WERE
VERY
NETWORK
INTENSIVE
YOU
COULD
RUN
INTO
SOME
SLOWDOWNS
BUT
THE
BIGGEST
PROBLEM
WOULD
BE
THE
MACHINE
ITSELF
SAY
YOU
HAVE
A
WITH
PLENTY
OF
RAM
AND
A
FAST
HARD
DISK
AND
NETWORK
CARD
IF
YOU
HAVE
PEOPLE
RUNNING
PROGRAMS
OFF
IT
YOURE
GOING
TO
SEE
SOME
SLOWDOWNS
BECAUSE
YOURE
NOW
ON
EFFECTIVELY
A
MHZ
OF
COURSE
DVX
WILL
ATTEMPT
TO
SEE
IF
TASKS
ARE
IDLE
AND
MAKE
SURE
THEY
GIVE
UP
THEIR
TIME
SLICE
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
WORKING
PROGRAMS
RUNNING
YOULL
KNOW
IT
WELL
I
CAN
BUY
A
BIGGER
AND
MORE
POWERFUL
SERVER
MACHINE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SIGNIFICANT
DROP
IN
PRICE
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR
THE
LINK
I
WANT
TO
USE
THOUGH
ISDN
IS
COSTLY
AND
THE
BANDWIDTH
LIMITED
THATS
WHY
MY
INTEREST
LIES
IN
SEEING
IF
SUCH
A
LINK
CAN
BE
USED
AND
SEE
WHAT
TRAFFIC
GOES
THROUGH
IT
SINCE
I
DONT
THINK
TOM
ALWAYS
GETS
TIME
TO
READ
THIS
GROUP
ILL
TAKE
THE
LIBERTY
OF
RESPONDING
TO
SOME
OF
THIS
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TOM
TO
REPLY
YOU
SHOULD
SEND
MAIL
TO
SUPPORTQDECKCOM
A
LINE
IS
CERTAINLY
GOING
TO
RESTRICT
YOU
FAR
MORE
THAN
THE
ETHERNET
THAT
WE
TYPICALLY
RUN
HOW
RESTRICTIVE
IT
WILL
BE
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
YOU
RUN
AND
HOW
YOU
RUN
IT
I
WOULD
THINK
THAT
A
COUPLE
OF
INSTANCES
OF
SOME
REALLY
NASTY
PROGRAM
LIKE
SMOKING
CLOVER
WOULD
MAKE
THE
LINK
USELESS
FOR
ANYONE
ELSE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
PROBABLY
XCLOCKS
QUIETLY
UPDATING
EVERY
SECONDS
OR
SO
WOULDNT
IMPACT
IT
TOO
MUCH
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
YOU
WILL
BE
SOMEWHERE
IN
BETWEEN
THESE
TWO
EXTREMES
GOING
BY
THE
WAY
I
PERSONALLY
USE
X
ON
A
DAILY
BASIS
I
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
HAVE
TO
SHARE
THAT
LINK
WITH
MORE
THAN
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVING
SAID
THAT
IF
YOU
CAN
TWEAK
THE
PROGRAMS
BEING
RUN
BY
ADDING
IN
CALLS
TO
GIVE
UP
TIME
SLICES
WHEN
IDLE
AND
THAT
SORT
OF
THING
YOU
COULD
PROBABLY
RUN
PEOPLE
ON
A
GIVEN
MACHINE
BEFORE
YOU
STARTED
SEEING
SLOWDOWNS
AGAIN
THIS
TIME
FROM
NETWORK
BANDWIDTH
HMMM
HAS
ANYONE
AT
YOUR
CENTRE
MONITORED
THE
TRAFFIC
AT
ALL
ARE
YOU
RUNNING
ANY
STANDARD
MSWINDOWS
PROGRAMS
LIKE
WORD
WHAT
SORT
OF
PACKETS
GO
BLAZING
THROUGH
WHAT
SIZE
LINK
DO
YOU
HAVE
OR
WHAT
IS
THE
AVERAGE
TRAFFIC
FLOW
GOING
THROUGH
YOUR
NETWORK
OR
DO
YOU
HAVE
FEW
HIGH
PEAKS
AND
THEN
MANY
LOW
POINTS
OUR
CORPORATE
WAN
IS
AS
UNIQUE
AS
ANY
OTHER
THE
USAGE
PATTERNS
ARE
NOT
VERY
GOOD
PREDICTORS
OF
HOW
YOURS
WILL
BEHAVE
THE
ONLY
ONE
OF
OUR
LOW
BANDWIDTH
LINKS
THAT
NORMALLY
GET
USED
IN
THIS
WAY
IS
A
LINK
TO
IRELAND
THAT
THEY
OFTEN
USE
TO
RUN
A
DOS
TEXT
BASED
CLIENT
END
OF
A
CLIENTSERVER
DATABASE
REMOTELY
FROM
THE
DVX
MACHINE
BEHIND
ME
SINCE
THE
SERVER
END
IS
OR
WAS
ALWAYS
AT
THIS
END
CALIFORNIA
IT
IS
FASTER
TO
REMOTELY
RUN
THE
CLIENT
VIA
DESQVIEW
X
AND
HAVE
A
SHORT
HOP
TO
THE
SERVER
THAN
RUNNING
THE
CLIENT
LOCALLY
AND
HAVING
A
LONG
HOP
TO
THE
SERVER
AS
I
WARNED
YOU
THIS
TELLS
US
VERY
LITTLE
ABOUT
HOW
YOU
USAGE
PATTERN
WILL
FILL
A
ISDN
LINK
RUNNING
WORD
FOR
WINDOWS
REMOTELY
IS
GOING
TO
ITSELF
BE
VERY
USAGE
DEPENDENT
LETS
BREAK
IT
INTO
PIECES
AND
LOOK
AT
IT
TRACKING
THE
MOUSE
POINTER
IS
EASY
AND
EFFICIENT
TO
TRANSLATE
FROM
WINDOWS
CALLS
INTO
X
POPPING
UP
A
MENU
IS
A
LITTLE
MORE
INVOLVED
AND
WILL
GENERATE
SOME
TRAFFIC
RESTORING
THE
SCREEN
THAT
WAS
COVERED
BY
THAT
MENU
MAY
BE
EASY
AND
MAY
NOT
BE
DOES
THE
SERVER
THAT
ITS
DISPLAYING
ON
HAVE
BACKING
STORE
IF
SO
AND
THE
SERVER
HAD
ENOUGH
MEMORY
THE
DISPLAY
CAN
BE
UPDATED
LOCALLY
AND
WILL
GENERATE
LITTLE
NETWORK
TRAFFIC
IF
NO
BACKING
STORE
THEN
WHAT
WAS
BEING
COVERED
UP
IF
IT
WAS
A
SOLID
COLORED
RECTANGLE
OF
SPACE
WE
CAN
TELL
YOUR
XSERVER
TO
DRAW
THAT
QUITE
EASILY
IF
IT
WAS
A
FULL
COLOR
BACKDROP
OF
REN
STIMPY
WE
MAY
HAVE
TO
SEND
IT
BACK
TO
THE
X
SERVER
BIT
BY
BIT
DVX
WILL
DO
ITS
LEVEL
BEST
TO
ONLY
REDRAW
THAT
SMALL
AREA
BUT
IN
SOME
UNUSUAL
CASES
THE
ENTIRE
SCREEN
MAY
NEED
TO
BE
REPAINTED
ASSUNING
A
SCREEN
WITH
BITS
PER
PIXEL
THATS
BITS
THAT
HAS
TO
BE
SENT
WORST
POSSIBLE
CASE
YOURE
LOOKING
AT
ABOUT
SECONDS
IN
REALITY
IT
WOULD
NEVER
BE
THIS
BAD
SINCE
THE
SCREEN
WILL
ALWAYS
HAVE
PARTS
THAT
WILL
BE
TRANLATABLE
INTO
HIGHER
LEVEL
X
CALLS
IT
ALL
REALLY
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
THE
PROGRAMS
ARE
DOING
IE
YOURE
GOING
TO
SEE
A
SLOWDOWN
FROM
XBANDWIDTH
A
LOT
SOONER
IF
YOUR
APPS
ARE
ALL
DOING
NETWORK
THINGS
ALSO
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
NETWORK
THINGS
I
VISION
USING
MS
WINDOWS
AND
OTHER
WINDOWS
APPLICATIONS
OVER
THE
NETWORK
WERE
THE
PROCESSES
ARE
RUNNING
ON
THE
SERVER
AND
ALL
I
AM
GETTING
ARE
THE
DISPLAYS
I
AM
WONDERING
HOW
GOOD
IS
THE
X
AND
SUBSEQUENTLY
DVX
PROTOCOL
IN
TRANSFERRING
THESE
IMAGES
WITH
XCALLS
AND
DISPLAYING
THEM
ON
A
CLIENTS
MACHINE
X
WAS
DESIGNED
FROM
THE
GROUND
UP
TO
BE
EFFICIENT
ACROSS
A
NETWORK
ITS
PRETTY
GOOD
FOR
THIS
X
PROGRAMS
ARE
BEST
DOS
TEXT
PROGRAMS
ARE
ALMOST
AS
GOOD
SINCE
WE
CONERT
THEM
TO
X
EASILY
SOMETHING
LIKE
WINX
IS
A
HYBRID
WE
INTERCEPT
THE
CALLS
WINDOWS
MAKES
TO
ITS
GRAPHICS
DRIVER
MOUSE
DRIVER
KEYBOARD
DRIVER
AND
CONVERT
THEM
TO
X
THE
CALLS
WINDOWS
IS
MAKING
ARE
IN
NO
WAY
DESIGNED
TO
BE
EFFICIENT
ON
A
PACKET
SWITCHED
NETWORK
WE
GO
TO
A
LOT
OF
TROUBLE
TO
CONVERT
THEM
TO
THE
HIGHES
LEVEL
XLIB
CALLS
WE
CAN
BUT
WE
ARE
SOMEWHAT
LIMITED
