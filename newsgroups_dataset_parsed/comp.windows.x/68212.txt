summary
how
to
make
a
windows
input
be
all
caps
thanks
to
bruce
barnett
who
recommended
xvttool
and
bernward
averwald
and
liam
quin
who
recommended
modifying
xdefaults
to
get
the
desired
behavior
for
a
class
of
xterms
in
xvttool
simply
create
a
key
file
that
looks
like
a
a
b
b
c
c
and
specify
said
key
file
on
the
command
line
this
will
translate
any
input
into
any
other
in
my
case
locase
to
upcase
works
great
and
you
get
a
customizable
buttonpad
on
the
right
or
left
side
to
use
an
xterm
solution
add
to
your
xdefaults
override
keya
stringan
or
override
n
keya
insertstringa
n
keyb
insertstringb
n
and
invoke
as
xterm
name
capxterm
