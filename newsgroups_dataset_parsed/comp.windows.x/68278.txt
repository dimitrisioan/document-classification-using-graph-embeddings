problems
with
characters
above
hi
all
ive
read
the
faq
ive
fiddled
around
but
i
am
still
having
problems
getting
my
poor
old
to
let
me
inputdisplay
characters
above
i
have
the
following
in
my
xdefaults
xtermfont
so
i
believe
that
i
have
the
correct
font
selected
to
use
in
xterm
i
have
not
set
my
lcctype
environment
variable
because
whatever
i
put
it
it
tells
me
that
that
locale
is
not
supported
apparently
we
have
no
additional
locales
defined
or
at
least
liblocale
doesnt
exist
i
can
get
some
of
the
characters
above
to
print
out
but
they
are
not
where
id
expect
them
for
example
altv
does
not
produce
a
u
umlaut
this
leads
me
to
believe
that
the
fault
lies
with
the
stty
settings
which
are
as
follows
speed
baud
line
susp

ive
struggled
with
this

for
a

and
any

anyone
could
offer
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks
