a
suggestion
by
john
is
so
then
its
up
to
the
individual
to
make
the
choice
whether
or
not
to
honour
it
and
part
with
money
personally
if
i
was
in
his
position
i
would
do
exactly
the
same
thing
john
has
obviously
put
in
lot
of
time
and
effort
into
xv
and
why
shouldnt
he
receive
some
money
for
it
it
is
interesting
to
look
at
the
changes
of
mind
that
john
has
had

do
whatever
you
want
with
this
program

it
would
be
nice
if
my

that
it
may
be
freely
modified

used
