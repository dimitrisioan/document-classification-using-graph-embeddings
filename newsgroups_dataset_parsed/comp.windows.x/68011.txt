STARTED
TO
USE
XWINDOWS
WHICH
IS
TO
SAY
RECENTLY
IVE
ACCUMULATED
A
FEW
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
XAPPLICATIONS
THREE
EXAMPLES
FOLLOW
IT
WAS
RECENTLY
MENTIONED
ON
COMPOSLINUX
THAT
THERE
EXISTS
A
POST
SCRIPT
VIEWER
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
THIS
AND
ANY
XEDITOR
THAT
IS
AN
IMPROVEMENT
ON
XEDIT
WHICH
I
FIND
ANNOYING
TRY
TO
GET
AXE
ITS
A
WONDERFUL
X
BASED
EDITOR
AND
MUCH
SIMPLER
TO
USE
THAN
EMACS
WHAT
IS
A
OVERKILL
OF
COURSE
EMACS
IS
NO
EDITOR
BUT
A
RELIGION
AT
ONE
POINT
I
WAS
THE
PROUD
OWNER
OF
AN
AMIGA
AND
HAVE
SINCE
UPGRADED
TO
A
WORKBENCH
THE

CLICK
INTERFACE
USED
INFO
FILES
TO
STORE
THE
DATA
FOR
ICONS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
APPLICATIONS
ON
A
GIVEN
VOLUME
I
HAVE
NOTICED
NO
SUCH
ARCHITECTURE
ANYWHERE
UNDER
LINUX
HOW
DOES
XWINDOWS
ASSOCIATE
ICONS
WITH
APPLICATIONS
CAN
ONE
EDIT
ICONS
OR
GENERATE
NEW
ONES
FOR
APPLICATIONS
SOMEHOW
IF
IT
MAKES
A
DIFFERENCE
IM
RUNNING
TWM
DONT
CALL
GOING
FROM
AN
AMIGA
TO
A
IBM
UPGRADE
THE
AMIGA
WORKBENCH
DID
THE
JOB
OF
A
DESKTOP
MANAGER
AND
THERE
IS
NO
REALLY
AMAZING
GOOD
X
DESKTOP
MANAGER
IN
THE
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
IM
CURRENTLY
WRITING
ONE
BUT
ITS
IN
VERY
EARLY
STAGE
XDTM
MAY
BE
A
MEDIUM
GOOD
REPLACEMENT
X
ASSOCIATES
ICONS
WITH
NOTHING
A
NUMBER
OF
X
WINDOW
MANAGERS
ASSOCIATE
ICONS
WITH
WINDOWS
IN
A
WAY
TO
EASE
WINDOW
MANAGEMENT
BUT
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
ICONS
OF
A
DESKTOP

NOTICED
SOME

DISCOVERED
A
WAY
TO
DISPLAY

OR
SOME
KIND
OF

EITHER
REPLACING
OR
