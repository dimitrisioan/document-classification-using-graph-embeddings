ever
since
i
started
to
use
xwindows
which
is
to
say
recently
ive
accumulated
a
few
questions
about
xapplications
three
examples
follow
it
was
recently
mentioned
on
composlinux
that
there
exists
a
post
script
viewer
i
am
interested
in
this
and
any
xeditor
that
is
an
improvement
on
xedit
which
i
find
annoying
try
to
get
axe
its
a
wonderful
x
based
editor
and
much
simpler
to
use
than
emacs
what
is
a
overkill
of
course
emacs
is
no
editor
but
a
religion
at
one
point
i
was
the
proud
owner
of
an
amiga
and
have
since
upgraded
to
a
workbench
the
pointand
click
interface
used
info
files
to
store
the
data
for
icons
associated
with
applications
on
a
given
volume
i
have
noticed
no
such
architecture
anywhere
under
linux
how
does
xwindows
associate
icons
with
applications
can
one
edit
icons
or
generate
new
ones
for
applications
somehow
if
it
makes
a
difference
im
running
twm
dont
call
going
from
an
amiga
to
a
ibm
upgrade
the
amiga
workbench
did
the
job
of
a
desktop
manager
and
there
is
no
really
amazing
good
x
desktop
manager
in
the
public
domain
im
currently
writing
one
but
its
in
very
early
stage
xdtm
may
be
a
medium
good
replacement
x
associates
icons
with
nothing
a
number
of
x
window
managers
associate
icons
with
windows
in
a
way
to
ease
window
management
but
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
icons
of
a
desktop
manager
application
the
tool
bitmap
is
there
for
simple
icon
drawing
ive
noticed
some
people
have
somehow
discovered
a
way
to
display
gif
or
some
kind
of
picture
files
in
the
background
either
replacing
or
overlapping
some
the
usual
grey
background
employed
by
xwindows
i
heard
this
was
done
using
some
application
but
i
dont
recall
what
it
was
