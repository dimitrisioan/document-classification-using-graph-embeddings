i
would
like
to
know
how
i
can
set
the
depth
of
the
frame
to
be
bits
i
tried
using
the
following
xlib
code
am
i
using
a
completely
wrong
approach
here
is
it
possible
to
set
the
depth
yes
and
colormap
for
a
window
created
by
xview
what
am
i
doing
wrong
look
up
xvdepth
also
you
might
want
to
try
using
xview
colormap
segments
instead
of
xlib
for
your
colormap
stuff
they
will
probably
be
easier
for
you
to
use
and
since
you
are
using
a
truecolor
visual
you
wont
be
losing
anything
compared
to
straight
xlib
