WRITES
I
AM
REPOSTING
THIS
BECAUSE
I
AM
NOT
SURE
MY
FIRST
POST
EVER
MADE
IT
OUT
I
HAVE
BUILT
AND
INSTALLED
ON
MY
SPARCSTATION
MY
AIM
IS
TO
RUN
THE
MIT
X
SERVER
BUT
RETAIN
THE
OPENLOOK
WINDOW
MANAGER
I
AM
SURE
THIS
IS
NOT
UNCOMMON
BUT
I
JUST
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
I
CHANGE
ANDOR
DELETE
EVERYTHING
THAT
I
NEED
TO
FOR
INSTANCE
I
CAN
START
XDM
IN
RCLOCAL
BUT
HOW
DO
I
GET
RID
OF
XNEWS
THE
OPENLOOK
WINDOW
MANAGER
SOURCE
IS
AVAILABLE
ON
THE
MIT
CONTRIB
TAPES
OR
FROM
EXPORTLCSMITEDU
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
BUILDING
THIS
TOO
RATHER
THAN
USING
THE
VERSION
FROM
OPENWINDOWS
IT
IS
OLWM
REGARDS
