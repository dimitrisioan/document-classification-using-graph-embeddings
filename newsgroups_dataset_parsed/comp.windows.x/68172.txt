YES
DONT
CONFUSE
THE
MOUSE
CURSOR
WITH
THE
TEXT
CURSOR
IN
THE
XTERMS
THE
LATTER
IS
ONLY
CONTROLLED
BY
THE
APPLICATION
BACK
IN
THE
DAYS
OF
I
DID
ANALYSE
THE
XTERM
CODE
THE
CURSOR
WAS
IMPLEMENTED
BY
DRAWING
A
RECTANGLE
AROUND
THE
CHARACTER
I
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
CHANGED
TIL
NOW
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
THE
SOURCES
YOU
COULD
ADD
A
BLINKING
CURSOR
VIA
XTAPPADDTIMEOUT
OR
SIMILAR
XTAPPADDTIMEOUT
DOESNT
WORK
IN
XTERM
BECAUSE
DESPITE
APPEARANCES
TO
THE
CONTRARY
XTERM
IS
NOT
REALLY
AN
XT
BASED
APPLICATION
OTHER
SOURCES
LIKE
TIMEOUTS
AND
INPUTS
ARE
NEVER
CHECKED
IN
XTERMS
MAIN
LOOP
SO
DONT
BE
SURPRISED
WHEN
YOU
TRY
THIS
AND
IT
DOESNT
WORK
