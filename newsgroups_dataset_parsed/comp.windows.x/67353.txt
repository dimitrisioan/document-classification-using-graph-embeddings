INPUT
FOCUS
TO
A
WINDOW
OTHER
THAN
WHERE
THE
POINTER
IS
I
HAVE
NOTICED
IN
FRAMEMAKER
ON
BOTH
THE
SGI
AND
SUN
PLATFORMS
THAT
CERTAIN
DIALOGS
SUCH
AS
COLUMN
LAYOUT
FOR
EXAMPLE
RESPOND
TO
KEYBOARD
TRAVERSAL
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
POINTER
IS
NOT
IN
THE
DIALOG
WINDOW
AND
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
POLICY
IS
POINTER
HOW
IS
THIS
DONE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
EMULATE
THIS
BEHAVIOR
IN
MY
APPLICATION
IT
SEEMS
A
REASONABLE
BEHAVIOR
SINCE
WHEN
A
DIALOG
IS
POPPED
UP
FROM
A
KEYBOARD
ACTION
THE
DIALOG
IS
NOT
GUARANTEED
TO
BE
UNDER
THE
POINTER
AND
THE
USER
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
REACH
FOR
THE
MOUSE
JUST
TO
MOVE
THE
FOCUS
ALTERNATIVELY
IM
OPEN
TO
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
AS
TO
WHAT
IS
THE
RIGHT
WAY
TO
INSURE
THAT
POPUPS
GET
THE
FOCUS
WHEN
THEY
APPEAR
PARTICULARLY
WHEN
THEY
ARE
INVOKED
FROM
THE
KEYBOARD
AND
ONES
KEYBOARD
FOCUS
POLICY
IS
