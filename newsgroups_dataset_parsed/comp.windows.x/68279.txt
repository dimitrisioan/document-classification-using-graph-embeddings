summary
i

this
may
i
am
looking
for
info
on
products
that
can
take
windows
source
on
a
unix
box
such
as
sparc
and
produce
a
motif
executable
another
requirement
is
that
mfc
should
be
supported
i
already
know
of
windu
by
bristol
technologies
hunter
sdk
mainwin
by
mainsoft
are
there
any
others
i
will
post
a
summary
if
its
wanted
i
got
a
few
requests
asking
for
a
summary
so
ill
attempt
one
here
heres
the
ones
i
know
of
windu
bristol
technologies
hunter
sdk
hunter
systems
mainwin
mainsoft
libwxm
visual
solutions
hunter
the
company
is
going
through
some
big
changes
i
expect
to
eventually
see
the
hunter
sdk
pop
up
with
a
new
name
at
the
moment
it
is
difficult
to
get
phone
calls
returned
and
otherwise
obtain
info
hopefully
they
will
post
something
about
themselves
once
things
settle
down
visual
solutions
libwxm
is
a
product
that
i
just
heard
about
they
dont
yet
support
mdi
or
mfc
libwxm
was
used
to
port
vissim
a
mathematical
modeling
package
does
native
motif
widgets
like
windu
from
bristol
contact
carrie
lemieux
at
for
more
info
shes
very
helpful
mainsoft
this
translates
windows
source
to
a
unix
executable
that
can
switch
off
between
a
windows
or
quasimotif
look
and
feel
at
runtime
they
skip
the
xt
and
xm
motif
x
toolkit
levels
and
go
straight
to
xlib
they
dont
yet
support
mfc
theyre
at
bristol
this
company
that
seems
to
be
on
the
right
track
windu
uses
xlibxtxm
to
give
a
real
motif
app
they
seem
to
be
doing
the
most
work
in
trying
to
support
things
like
dde
common
dialogs
and
more
on
the
horizon
my
contact
there
is
knowledgeable
responds
to
my
email
and
wrote
an
example
program
for
me
showing
how
to
obtain
x
widgets
from
windows
handles
theyre
at
or
you
can
