I
KNOW
THAT
THE
MWM
HAS
AN
RESOURCE
TO
SPECIFY
IF
POSITIONS
ARE
TO
BE
USED
FOR
THE
BORDER
OF
A
WINDOW
OR
FOR
THE
USER
WINDOW
MAYBE
OTHER
WINDOW
MANAGERS
HAVE
SIMILAR
OPTIONS
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
USER
WINDOW
POSITION
AND
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATION
WINDOW
POSITION
IS
TO
SUBTRACT
THEIR
POSITIONS
YOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
USE
XQUERYTREE
AND
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATIONS
WINDOW
IS
THE
PARENT
OF
YOUR
WINDOW
UNFORTUNATELY
YOU
CAN
ONLY
FIGURE
OUT
THE
DECORATION
WIDTH
AND
HEIGHT
AFTER
THE
WINDOW
HAS
BEEN
MAPPED
THIS
WAY
ANOTHER
WAY
WOULD
BE
TO
USE
GETGEOMETRY
TO
FIND
OUT
WHERE
YOU
ARE
RELATIVE
TO
THE
FRAME
AND
TRANSLATECOORDINATES
TO
FIND
OUT
WHERE
YOUR
WINDOWS
UPPERLEFT
CORNER
REALLY
IS
AS
IVE
SAID
BEFORE
THERES
NO
RELIABLE
WAY
TO
FIND
OUT
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATION
IF
YOUR
WINDOW
HAS
BEEN
REPARENTED
YOU
CANT
ASSUME
THAT
THE
WINDOW
YOURE
PARENTED
TO
IS
THE
WINDOW
THAT
HOLDS
ALL
OF
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATION
THERE
MAY
BE
SEVERAL
LAYERS
OF
WINDOWS
DOING
MULTIPLE
XQUERYTREES
UNTIL
YOU
GET
TO
THE
ROOT
WILL
WORK
IN
MOST
CASES
BUT
THERES
NO
GUARANTEE
THAT
THE
OUTSIDE
DECORATION
WINDOW
IS
PARENTED
TO
THE
ROOT
