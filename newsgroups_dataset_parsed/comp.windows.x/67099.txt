HI
IM
NEW
TO
THIS
GROUP
SO
PLEASE
BEAR
WITH
ME
TWO
YEARS
AGO
I
WROTE
A
SUNVIEW
APPLICATION
FOR
FAST
ANIMATION
OF
RASTER
FILES
WITH
SUNVIEW
BECOMING
RAPIDLY
OBSELETE
IVE
FINALLY
DECIDED
TO
REWRITE
EVERYTHING
FROM
SCRATCH
IN
XVIEW
I
PUT
TOGETHER
A
QUICK
TEST
AND
IVE
FOUND
THAT
XPUTIMAGE
IS
CONSIDERABLY
SLOWER
FACTOR
OF
ON
AVERAGE
THAN
THE
SUNVIEW
COMMAND
PWROP
WHICH
MOVES
IMAGE
DATA
FROM
MEMORY
PIXRECTS
TO
A
CANVAS
THIS
WAS
ON
A
SPARC
IPX
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
X
PROTOCOL
COMMUNICATION
IS
SLOWING
THINGS
DOWN
OR
XPUTIMAGE
IS
INEFFICIENTOR
BOTH
USING
XPUTIMAGE
YOUR
SOURCE
IS
MAINTAINED
BY
THE
CLIENT
AND
THE
DESTINATION
IS
MAINTAINED
BY
THE
SERVER
THUS
YOU
INCUR
THE
OVERHEAD
OF
TRANSPORTING
THROUGH
WHATEVER
CLIENTSERVER
COMMUNICATIONS
MECHANISM
YOU
ARE
USING
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
YOU
TO
MAINTAIN
YOUR
SOURCE
IMAGES
IN
PIXMAPS
THESE
ARE
MAINTAINED
BY
THE
SERVER
SO
COPYING
THEM
INTO
A
WINDOW
IS
MUCH
CHEAPER
ALSO
MAKE
SURE
YOU
ARE
NOT
SENDING
ANY
UNNECESSARY
XSYNCS
OR
RUNNING
IN
XSYNCHONIZE
MODE
IF
YOU
NEED
SPEED
AND
YOUR
CLIENT
CAN
RUN
ON
THE
SAME
HOST
AS
THE
X
SERVER
YOU
SHOULD
USE
THE
SHARED
MEMORY
EXTENSION
TO
THE
SAMPLE
X
SERVER
MITSHM
XDPYINFO
WILL
TELL
YOU
IF
YOUR
SERVER
HAS
THIS
EXTENSION
THIS
IS
CERTAINLY
AVAILABLE
WITH
THE
SAMPLE
MIT
X
SERVER
RUNNING
UNDER
SUNOS
A
WORD
OF
WARNING
MAKE
SURE
YOUR
KERNEL
IS
CONFIGURED
TO
SUPPORT
SHARED
MEMORY
AND
ANOTHER
WORD
OF
WARNING
OPENWINDOWS
IS
SLOWER
THAN
THE
MIT
SERVER
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
AN
IMAGING
TOOL
USING
XVIEW
FOR
THE
GUI
BY
THE
WAY
WHICH
YIELDS
OVER
FRAMES
PER
SECOND
FOR
BIT
IMAGES
RUNNING
ON
A
SPARC
IPC
HALF
THE
CPU
GRUNT
OF
AN
IPX
THIS
HAS
PROVED
QUITE
SUFFICIENT
FOR
ANIMATIONS
REGARDS
