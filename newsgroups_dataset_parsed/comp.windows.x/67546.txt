device
independence
i
recently
corrected
the
resolution
on
my
sparcstation
by
changing
from
local
dpi
to
local
dpi
i
determined
that
my
monitor
was
dpi
by
measuring
the
active
screen
area
and
dividing
by
resolution
however
this
has
caused
my
application
fonts
to
behave
strangely
after
some
research
i
believe
this
is
caused
by
my
applications
requesting
fonts
by
family
weight
slant
and
pointsize
i
believe
that
x
is
grabbing
the
first
font
on
the
path
with
these
characteristics
and
displaying
it
since
i
have
only
and
fonts
on
my
path
the
results
are
inaccurate
i
do
have
some
speedo
fonts
but
not
for
the
family
i
am
using
helvetica
i
think
this
is
incorrect
the
fonts
should
always
be
provided
in
the
resolution
of
the
display
this
never
seems
to
happen
unless
you
explicitly
request
fonts
by
xres
and
yres
this
is
true
of
both
the
scaleable
and
bitmapped
fonts
for
instance
the
command
xfd
fn
will
invoke
a
font
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
speedo
font
the
command
xfd
fn
will
invoke
a
font
or
a
font
depending
on
my
font
path
despite
the
fact
that
x
knows
my
display
is
dpi
and
that
it
can
generate
an
font
for
me
unless
i
my
applications
specifies
a
resolution
x
appears
to
pick
a
stupid
default
is
this
a
bug
is
it
a
feature
if
so
why
is
there
anything
i
can
do
to
get
around
this
problem
people
have
suggested
that
i
lie
about
my
resolution
and
specify
a
single
font
path
or
not
both
this
would
at
least
make
my
app
consistent
but
i
like
being
able
to
look
at
rulers
that
appear
in
my
paint
application
and
say
yup
thats

anyone
have
a
set
of
bitmapped

i
can
