the
mit
tapes
come
with
documentation
written
by
keith
packard
on
the
shared
memory
extension
to
x
look
in
mitdocextensionsmitshmms
i
found
this
invaluble
unfortunately
there
is
a
bit
of
work
to
set
up
the
shared
memory
segments
making
an
ximage
from
it
etc
also
there
is
an
extension
query
to
determine
if
the
server
supports
it
but
you
still
need
to
test
if
the
server
is
running
on
the
same
host
and
if
shared
memory
is
enabled
in
the
kernel
i
have
written
layers
of
convience
routines
which
make
all
this
transparent
as
for
the
xview
code
well
i
doubt
that
would
be
considered
interesting
the
interesting
stuff
is
done
in
a
c
object
library
people
interested
in
this
code
can
email
me

thanks
for
docs
info
it
turns
out
that
if
i
leave
out
colormap
updates
between
frames
and
use
tvtwm
my
tests
with
frames
on
an
ipx
using
the
serverresident
pixmap
method
give
an
astonishing
frames
per
second
and
very
smooth
i
think
ive
found
the
best
solution
thanks
to
the
generous
help
on
this
group
however
i
may
have
colormap
questions
later
