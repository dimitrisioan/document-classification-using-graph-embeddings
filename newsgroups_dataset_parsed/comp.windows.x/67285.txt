is
there
anyway
to
use
x
windows
over
an
async
line
clearly
you
could
use
x
it
is
x
window
no
it
isnt
it
is
the
x
window
system
or
or
x
or
any
of
a
number
of
other
designations
accepted
by
the
x
consortium
in
fact
doing
man
x
on
pretty
much
any
machine
will
tell
you
the
x
consortium
requests
that
the
following
names
be
used
when
referring
to
this
software
x
x
window
system
x
version
x
window
system
version
there
is
no
such
thing
as
x
windows
or
x
window
despite
the
repeated
misuse
of
the
forms
by
the
trade
rags
this
probably
tells
you
something
about
how
much
to
trust
the
trade
rags
if
they
cant
even
get
the
name
of
the
window
system
right
why
should
one
trust
anything
else
they
have
to
say
with
regard
to
dialup
implementations
there
are
several
you
can
buy
serial
terminals
from
a
couple
of
companies
including
both
graphon
and
ncd
in
fact
im
composing
this
from
an
ncd
running
over
serial
lines
across
kbaud
connection
ncd
also
sells
a
softwareonly
package
that
provides
xremote
which
is
ncds
implementation
of
serial
for
pcs
there
may
be
other
such
software
packages
available
is
supposed
to
include
a
standardized
compression
scheme
for
running
over
lowspeed
connections
its
called
low
bandwidth
x
lbx
and
is
based
on
improved
versions
of
the
techniques
used
in
ncds
xremote
it
seems
likely
that
once
lbx
is
released
as
a
consortium
standard
there
will
be
several
vendors
willing
to
supply
implementations
for
various
