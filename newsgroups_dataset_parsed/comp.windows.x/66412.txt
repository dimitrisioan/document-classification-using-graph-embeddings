theres
a
bug
in
sunos
which
is
alluded
to
in
the
faq
although
there
its
talking
about
as
being
affected
you
need
to
force
libxmu
to
be
linked
statically
rather
than
dynamically
which
works
around
the
linker
error
the
simplest
thing
to
do
is
edit
each
of
the
makefiles
where
theres
a
failure
and
change
the
line
which
reads
xmulib
lxmusrc
lxmu
to
xmulib
lxmusrc
bstatic
lxmu
bdynamic
no
this
is
only
relevant
for
openwindows
as
shipped
with
sunos
it
is
not
relevant
for
mit
mit
should
compile
without
problems
