i
get
the
impression
andrew
is
from
the
fsf
but
i
dont
know
what
it
looks
like
either
the
andrew
user
interface
system
is
supported
maintained
enhanced
and
distributed
by
the
andrew
consortium
carnegie
mellon
the
distribution
terms
are
those
of
the
x
consortium
not
the
gnu
public
license
thus
anyone
can
commercially
exploit
the
andrew
code
without
restriction
to
encourage
membership
however
we
defer
universal
release
of
the
latest
versions
until
consortium
members
have
had
an
opportunity
to
explore
the
new
capabilities
to
se
what
auis
looks
like
you
can
try
a
remote
demo
you
need
an
x
server
is
best
on
a
machine
linked
to
the
internet
give
the
command
finger
helpatkitccmuedu
for
instructions
note
the
demo
version
does
not
use
the
motiflookandfeel
scrollbar
but
one
is
available
you
can
use
it
on
the
demo
by
changing
an
option
in
the
preferences
file
and
starting
a
new
editor
the
andrew
toolkit
component
of
auis
is
ideal
if
you
want
to
build
applications
using
compound
documents
andrews
major
feature
is
its
architecture
for
recursive
embedding
of
objects
equation
in
table
in
figure
in
text
for
example
this
architecture
extends
to
areas
not
usually
found
in
toolkits
including
file
stream
formats
cutpaste
and
printing
andrew
also
provides
some
of
the
most
commonly
requested
applications
word
processor
spreadsheet
drawing
editor
and
font
editor
the
latter
two
are
in
version
which
will
be
generally
released
on
the
tape
in
december
