problems
i
am
having
problems
with
a
motif
application
that
when
run
on
another
machine
with
different
x
paths
etc
cant
find
the
xkeysymdb
file
this
causes
a
large
warning
output

while

etc
as
the
file
is
in
a
different
location
but
xt
seems
to
only
look
for
it
in
the
place
where
it
is
on
the
machine
the
app
was
compiled
on
is
there
any
way
to
read
the
xkeysymdb
manually
with
an
xxt
call
so
that
additions
to
the
xkeysymdb
can
be
distributed
with
the
application
i
have
used
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
but
i
need
a
fix
so
that
these
translations
in
the
application
can
be
recognised
