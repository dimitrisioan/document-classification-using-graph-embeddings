i
am
using
xdm
on
with
and
on
and
sparcs
running
sunos
prior
to
using
xdm
i
used
to
set
path
and
other
environment
variables
like
manpath
helppath
arch
etc
in
my
login
file
with
xdm
the
login
file
doesnt
get
executed
and
therefore
neither
the
olwm
rootwindow
nor
my
applications
know
about
these
variables
you
should
try
having
a
xsession
script
in
home
to
do
these
things
xdm
will
start
up
your
process
using
the
system
version
usually
which
should
check
whether
you
have
your
won
and
change
to
that
if
you
do
take
a
copy
of
the
system
one
and
edit
it
note
that
