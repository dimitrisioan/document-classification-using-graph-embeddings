i
have
a
piece
of
x
code
that
compiles
fine
on
pmaxmach
as
well
as
but
whenever
it
compiles
on
it
gives
me
undefined
ld
errors
sin
cos
pow
floor
getwmshellwidgetclass
getapplicationshellwidgetclass
the
following
libraries
that
i
linked
it
to
are
lxaw
lxmu
lxt
lxext
the
makefile
is
generated
off
an
imake
template
can
anyone
give
me
pointers
as
to
what
im
missing
out
to
compile
on
a
well
the
first
are
easy
you
need
the
math
library
try
adding
lm
after
dont
know
if
thats
the
whole
problem
but
its
a
start
i
think
you
should
try
linking
to
usrliblibxmua
instead
of
lxmu
at
least
that
solved
the
problem
for
me
