re
appdefaults
files
hello
when
starting
bx
if
you
recieve
an
error
message
saying
cannot
load
appdefaults
file
check
your
xapplresdir
environment
variable
and
then
put
the
file
builderxcessory
this
is
the
appdefaults
file
for
bx
in
the
directory
specified
by
the
xuserfilesearchpath
environment
variable
if
you
dont
have
an
xuserfilesearchpath
environment
variable
then
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
be
the
directory
where
the
builderxcessory
file
is
you
can
do
this
using
the
setenv
command
under
csh
note
that
the
name
ends
in
ad
so
you
will
have
to
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
bxnad
to
get
the
appdefaults
to
load
correctly
to
make
sure
the
the
appdefaults
file
can
be
read
by
all
the
users
make
sure
that
a
copy
of
or
a
link
to
the
appdefaults
file
exists
in
or
usropenwinlibappdefaults
depending
on
how
your
system
is
set
up
once
you
have
taken
care
of
this
set
the
systemdirectory
resource
to
be
the
directory
in
which
you
have
installed
bx
for
example
lets
say
ive
installed
bx
in
t
then
my
system
directory
resource
should
be
set
like
this
systemdirectory
tbuilderxcessory
