getting

wondering

developers
whats
the
deal
i
thought
xhibition
was
for
xwindows
jesse
w
asher
yes
xhibition
is
for
the
x
window
system
the
x
window
system
conference
remains
the
largest
and
most
complete
conference
devoted
to
x
nineteen
full
and
half
day
tutorials
and
thirtysix
technical
sessions
over
three
days
provide
huge
amounts
of
information
for
x
application
developers
add
vendor
exhibits
and
a
product
presentation
track
to
provide
information
on
what
folks
can
purchase

complete

xhibition
is
growing
fortunately
for
us
and
we
have
added
some
additional
conferences
surveys
that
we
have
given
have
indicated
additional
topics
of
interest
these
include
object
oriented
technologies
such
as
the
object
management
groups
orb
and
corba
c
as
it
applies
to
x
client
server
technologies
such
as
dce
threads
databases
object
oriented
and
relational
and
not
surprisingly
when
you
look
at
the
audience
windows
nt
with
the
bulk
of
the
xhibition
audience
and
the
unix
community
developing
applications
for
inhouse
or
custom
use
a
new
operating
system
from
a
player
as
large
as
microsoft
needs
to
be
evaluated
with
ms
windows
on
so
many
desktops
and
the
price
of
computing
power
dropping
its
successor
needs
to
be
evaluated
as
corporations
begin
to
look
at
nt
so
must
their
developers
and
suppliers
the
mission
of
the
xhibition
technical
conferences
is
to
provide
information
to
the
application
developer
and
to
the
technology
planner
the
nt
conference
at
xhibition
is
designed
to
do
just
that
we
worked
with
microsoft
to
provide
the
only
conference
this
year
specifically
designed
to
show
x
and
unix
developers
the
capabilities
of
windows
and
nt
if
you
arent
sure
that
nt
has
what
you
need
for
your
application
development
or
systems
deployment
this
is
the
place
to
find
out
ask
the
folks
from
microsoft
get
them
to
show
you
what
you
need
conference
attendees
will
receive
nt
software
development
kits
to
bang
on
evaluate
and
generally
to
see
for
yourself
i
hope
this
doesnt
sound
like
an
nt
commercial
it
should
sound
like
an
xhibition
commercial
i
just
want
to
reiterate
that
the
xhibition
audience
is
growing
and
xhibition
is
growing
along
with
it
the
industry
is
a
confusing
place
at
the
moment
with
unix
cose
nt
dce
corba
and
all
of
the
other
acronyms
sprouting
up
xhibition
can
help
sort
out
the
confusion
