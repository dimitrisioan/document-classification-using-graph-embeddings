no
it
isnt
it
is
the
x
window
system
or
or
x
or
any
of
a
number
of
other
designations
accepted
by
the
x
consortium
there
is
no
such
thing
as
x
windows
or
x
window
despite
the
repeated
misuse
of
the
forms
by
the
trade
rags
i
used
to
think
this
way
and
not
just
about
x
for
example
incorrect
english
constructs
such
as
its
raining
or
its
window
id
annoy
me
however
there
comes
a
time
when
popular
usage
starts
to
dictate
the
way
things
really
are
in
the
world
well
yes
and
no
i
dont
particularly
want
this
discussion
to
spark
a
lengthy
debate
but
i
do
think
its
worth
pointing
out
that
popular
usage
is
not
always
sufficient
excuse
in
this
case
for
example
i
think
an
appropriate
parallel
may
be
found
in
the
pronunciation
of
proper
names
if
people
commonly
misspelled
or
mispronounced
your
name
would
you
feel
compelled
to
change
it
probably
not
the
same
is
true
of
x
the
x
window
system
x
and
related
monickers
are
proper
names
in
the
same
sense
that
any
product
name
is
a
proper
name
in
fact
some
of
them
are
trademarked
names
the
fact
that
many
people
get
them
wrong
is
largely
beside
the
point
as
for
the
trade
publications
that
promulgate
things
like
x
window
or
xwindows
or
any
of
the
other
nonsensical
variants
one
often
sees
consider
the
fact
that
these
publications
are
supposedly
written
by
journalists
would
you
trust
the
facts
of
a
journalist
who
couldnt
be
bothered
to
get
the
name
of
hisher
source
right
would
you
trust
a
product
review
by
someone
who
got
the
name
of
the
product
wrong
popular
usage
is
as
it
may
be
but
i
for
one
am
all
for
holding
people
who
claim
to
be
journalists
to
a
higher
standard
of
correctness
indeed
the
fact
that
x
won
out
over
news
was
really
down
to
popular
opinion
i
know
we
all
think
its
technically
superior
as
well
technically
superior
to
news
well
in
some
alternate
universe
perhaps
