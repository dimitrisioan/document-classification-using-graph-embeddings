A
STRANGE
PROBLEM
WITH
TEXT
HELLO
I
AM
TESTING
A
PORT
OF
TO
COHERENT
A
UNIX
CLONE
OS
FOR
INTEL
ARCHITECTURE
MACHINES
I
AM
SEEING
A
STRANGE
PROBLEM
WITH
TEXT
IN
CLIENTS
LIKE
XVT
A
SIMPLE
TERMINAL
EMULATOR
PROGRAM
THE
PROBLEM
MANIFESTS
IT
SELF
WHEN
THE
SHELL
ECHOES
TYPED
CHARACTERS
BACK
TO
THE
SERVER
FOR
DISPLAY
ONE
AT
A
TIME
THE
CHARACTERS
APPEAR
TO
BE
TOO
CLOSELY
SPACED
WITH
THE
RESULT
BEING
THAT
THE
CHARACTER
ECHOED
DESTROYS
THE
RIGHTMOST
EDGE
OF
THE
FIRST
CHARACTER
THEN
THE
CHARACTER
DESTROYS
THE
RIGHTMOST
EDGE
OF
THE
SECOND
CHARACTER
AND
SO
ON
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THERE
IS
AN
INVISIBLE
BOUNDARY
AROUND
A
CHARACTER
WHICH
OBSCURES
A
PORTION
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
CHARACTER
THERE
IS
NO
PROBLEM
BETWEEN
THE
CHARACTERS
WHEN
THE
SHELL
RETURNS
A
COMPLETE
LINE
OF
TEXT
ONLY
WHEN
THE
OUTPUT
IS
A
SERIES
OF
INDIVIDUAL
CHARACTERS
IF
ANYONE
HAS
ANY
IDEAS
WHAT
THE
PROBLEM
MIGHT
BE
OR
WHERE
I
SHOULD
LOOK
TO
FIND
IT
IT
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
REGARDS
AND
THANKS
