RE
FINDING
OUT
STATE
OF
STATE
KEYS
EG
CAPSLOCK
AND
NUMLOCK
IN
RPSARBORTEXTCOM
RALPH
SEGUIN
WRITES
MY
QUESTION
IS
THIS
IS
THERE
A
MEANS
OF
DETERMINING
WHAT
THE
STATE
OF
CAPSLOCK
ANDOR
NUMLOCK
IS
I
DONT
KNOW
ANY
WAY
EXCEPT
TO
SEE
WHAT
MODIFIERS
ARE
ON
IN
TH
KEYPRESS
EVENT
OF
COURSE
IF
THERE
IS
SOME
REASON
WHY
YOU
NEED
TO
ALWAYS
KNOW
THE
STATE
OF
MODIFIERS
EVEN
IF
YOUR
WINDOWS
DONT
HAVE
THE
KEYBORADS
FOCUS
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
ASK
FOR
KEYPRESS
EVENTS
FROM
THE
ROOT
WINDOW
THEN
YOU
GET
ALL
THE
KEYPRESSES
AND
YOU
ALWAYS
KNOW
WHAT
HAVE
BEEN
PRESSED
AN
EVEN
MORE
POINTED
QUESTION
IS
THERE
AN
EASY
MEANS
OF
MAKING
AN
X
KEYBOARD
ACT
LIKE
A
PC
KEYBOARD
IE
CAPSLOCK
IS
ACTIVE
AND
THE
USER
PRESSES
SHIFTA
ID
LIKE
TO
GET
A
LOWERCASE
A
INSTEAD
OF
A
I
THINK
THIS
IS
JUST
A
QUESTION
OF
HOW
TO
IMPLEMENT
XLOOKUPSTRING
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
WRITE
ANOTHER
FUNCTION
THAT
INTERPRETS
THE
KEYPRESSES
AS
YOU
LIKE
YOU
CAN
LOOK
AT
THE
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
XLOOKUPSTRING
FROM
THE
XLIB
SOURCES
AND
THEN
MODIFY
IT
A
LITTLE
BIT
