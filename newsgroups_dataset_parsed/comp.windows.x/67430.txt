CLICK
TO
FOCUS
VS
POINT
TO
FOCUS
I
AM
HAVING
THE
PROBLEM
OF
ENSURING
POINTTOFOCUS
WHEN
THE
MOUSE
CURSOR
ENTERS
A
WINDOW
IN
MY
APPLICATION
IM
USING
INTERVIEWS
BUT
THAT
MAY
NOT
MATTER
THIS
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
GENERIC
PROBLEM
IN
X
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
USE
OPENWINDOWS
ON
A
WITH
POINTTOFOCUS
SET
AND
THAT
GENERALLY
WORKS
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
DEPENDING
ON
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
IN
SOME
WINDOW
WHEN
I
MOVE
THE
CURSOR
FROM
ONE
SHELL
TOOL
WINDOW
TO
ANOTHER
OR
SO
IT
SEEMS
MY
QUESTION
THEN
IS
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
WITHIN
X
TO
GUARANTEE
POINTTO
FOCUS
WITHIN
MY
APPLICATION
THANKS
FOR
ANY
RESPONSE
