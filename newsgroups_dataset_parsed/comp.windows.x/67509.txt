JOSEPH

WRITES
MOST
GRAPHICS
SYSTEMS
I
HAVE
SEEN
HAVE
DRAWING
ROUTINES
THAT
ALSO
SPECIFY
A
COLOR
FOR
DRAWING
LIKE
DRAWPOINTXYCOLOR
OR
OR
WITH
X
I
HAVE
TO
DO
SOMETHING
LIKE
XSETFOREGROUNDCURRENTCOLOR
XDRAWPOINTDWXY
WHY
SPLIT
THIS
INTO
TWO
FUNCTIONS
WHY
DID
X
DESIGNERS
DECIDE
TO
NOT
ASSOCIATE
THE
COLOR
WITH
THE
OBJECT
BEING
DRAWN
AND
INSTEAD
ASSOCIATE
IT
WITH
THE
DISPLAY
IT
IS
BEING
DRAWN
ON
FOR
FLEXIBILITY
ANYWAY
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
NOT
REALLY
TRUE
THE
COLOR
INFORMATION
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
A
GRAPHICSCONTEXT
NOT
WITH
A
DISPLAY
AND
THE
GC
IS
A
PARAMETER
TO
THE
DRAWING
ROUTINES
SO
IF
YOU
NEED
TO
FAST
SWITCH
BETWEEN
GREEN
DOTTED
LINES
AND
BLUE
ONES
OF
WIDTH
YOU
CAN
MAKE
GCS
FOR
THOSE
CASES
AND
THEN
SIMPLY
DO
FOR
THIS
EFFECT
THIS
IS
EVENTUALLY
MORE
COMPLICATED
TO
DO
FOR
THE
PROGRAMMER
BUT
ALSO
MUCH
MORE
EFFICIENT
AND
FLEXIBLE
YOU
WOULD
NOT
INCLUDE
ALL
THE
OTHER
PARAMETERS
LIKE
LINE
PATTERN
WITH
CAP
AND
JOINSTYLE
DRAWMODE
AND
SO
ON
IN
EVERY
DRAWING
CALL
SO
WHY
DO
IT
FOR
COLOR
BTW
STAY
AWAY
FROM
XDRAWPOINT
IF
YOU
DONT
REALLY
NEED
IT
TO
DRAW
RANDOM
POINTS
FOR
IMAGE
TRANSFERS
THERE
ARE
IMAGE
