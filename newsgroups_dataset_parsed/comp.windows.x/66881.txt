TENE
WRITES
I
AM
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THE
CURRENT
C
TOOLKIT
DIRECTIONS
MORE
SIMPLY
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHICH
C
TOOLKIT
TO
BET
ON
FOR
USE
IN
A
NEW
LONG
TERM
PROJECT
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
I
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
MOTIF
WWL
INTERVIEWS
GINA
AND
A
FEW
VARIATIONS
ON
THE
ABOVE
IVE
ALSO
DONE
A
CURSORY
EXAMINATION
OF
ROGUE
WAVES
VIEWH
I
LIKE
VIEWHS
ABSTRACTIONS
BEST
OF
ALL
OF
THE
TOOLKITS
I
MENTIONED
BUT
THE
RESULTING
CODE
LOOKS
LITTLE
LIKE
MOTIF
AND
I
HAVE
LITTLE
CONFIDENCE
THAT
THIS
SOFTWARE
WILL
CATCH
ON
OR
OTHERWISE
RESULT
IN
SIGNIFICANT
LONGEVITY
FOR
MY
CODE
GINA
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
WRITE
CODE
WHICH
LOOKS
A
GREAT
DEAL
LIKE
MOTIF
AND
ALSO
MAKES
INTERESTING
USE
OF
INHERITANCE
BUT
THE
RESULTING
CODE
IS
ALMOST
TOO
MOTIFLIKE
AND
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
LESS
VERBOSE
THAN
EQUIVALENT
C
CODE
INTERVIEWS
LOOKS
PROMISING
BUT
I
HAVENT
FOUND
A
FREE
VERSION
WITH
MOTIF
SUPPORT
AND
IM
NOT
CONFIDENT
HOW
WIDELY
INTERVIEWS
WITH
MOTIF
SUPPORT
WILL
BE
ADOPTED
AND
WHAT
IF
ANY
SPECIFIC
MOTIF
SUPPORT
WILL
BE
AVAILABLE
OVER
TIME
THE
OTHER
LIBRARIES
PRODUCE
CODE
WHICH
IS
LESS
MOTIFLIKE
BUT
WHICH
DOES
NOT
MAKE
SUFFICIENT
USE
OF
THE
FEATURES
OF
C
TO
SIMPLIFY
MY
CODING
TASK
AT
THIS
POINT
MY
INCLINATION
IS
TO
WRITE
MY
MOTIF
MANIPULATION
ROUTINES
IN
C
AND
INVOKE
THOSE
ROUTINES
FROM
MY
C
CODE
USING
SIMPLE
ABSTRACTIONS
SUITED
TO
MY
SPECIFIC
TASK
LATER
IF
OSF
OR
SOME
CREDIBLE
STANDARDSSETTING
BODY
COMES
UP
WITH
A
C
INTERFACE
TO
MOTIF
I
WILL
CHANGE
TO
THAT
IT
DOES
ME
NO
GOO
TO
WRITE
IN
C
IF
MY
CHOICE
OF
INTERFACES
LEAVES
ME
WITH
CODE
WHICH
LEAVES
ME
TIED
TO
AN
ABSTRACTION
WHICH
IS
NOT
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
INDUSTRY
DIRECTIONS
ITS
BETTER
TO
TAKE
A
STANDARD
IF
INFERIOR
SOLUTION
FOR
NOW
THAN
TO
GO
WITH
A
SLGIHTLY
SUPERIOR
APPROACH
WHICH
WILL
LEAVE
ME
WITH
BOTH
USELESS
CODE
AND
USELESS
SKILLS
A
FEW
YEARS
FROM
NOW
VIEWSH
IS
THE
ONLY
LIBRARY
ID
CONSIDER
RIGHT
NOW
BUT
IN
OUR
ENVIRONMENT
WED
END
UP
SPENDING
NEARLY
TO
USE
IT
AND
I
CANT
JUSTIFY
IT
WHEN
ITS
LIKELY
TO
CAUSE
SHORTTERM
PRODUCTIVITY
DECREASES
AS
WE
LEARN
THE
NEW
ABSTRACTION
AND
IS
UNLIKELY
TO
BE
A
SUFFICIENTLY
LONGLIVED
SOLUTION
FOR
US
TO
