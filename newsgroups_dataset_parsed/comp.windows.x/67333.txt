WRITES
IM
WRITING
AN
X
SERVER
FOR
SOME
VIDEOGENERATION
EQUIPMENT
THE
HARDWARE
IS
TRUECOLOR
IN
YUV
SPACE
IN
X
TERMS
IT
HAS
A
STATIC
COLOR
VISUAL
I
WOULD
REALLY
LIKE
TO
HAVE
THE
SERVER
JUST
PRESENT
THIS
STATIC
VISUAL
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
WILL
BE
ACCEPTABLE
TO
MOST
X
CLIENTS
THE
THREE
PROBLEMS
I
SEE
ARE
THE
COLORMAP
THOUGH
HUGE
IS
STATIC
ALL
PIXELS
WOULD
BE
BYTES
WIDE
BECAUSE
THE
HARDWARE
ACTUALLY
LIVES
IN
YUV
SPACE
THE
TRANSLATION
RGBYUV
WILL
INTRODUCE
SOME
ROUNDING
ERROR
BEING
MORE
OF
A
SERVER
GUY
THAN
A
CLIENT
GUY
I
ASK
WILL
THESE
LIMITATIONS
THWART
MANY
X
CLIENTS
OR
WILL
MOST
OF
THE
X
STUFF
FLOATING
AROUND
BLITHELY
ACCEPT
WHAT
THEYRE
GIVEN
I
COULD
WRITE
THE
SERVER
TO
ALSO
PRESENT
A
PSEUDOCOLOR
VISUAL
OF
EG
BITS
BUT
ID
RATHER
AVOID
THIS
IF
NOT
NECESSARY
EVEN
TRUECOLOR
MACHINES
ARE
IN
MOST
CASES
RUNNING
AN
EMULATED

PSEUDOCOLOR
VISUAL
ONLY
TO
GET

MOTIF
APPS
AND
THELIKE
TO

I
STRONGLY
SUPPOSE
YOU
TO
EMULATE
AT
LEAST
BIT
TRUECOLOR
SHOULD
BE
NO
PROBLEM
ONLY
SOME
TRANSLATION
ROUNDING
SHOULD
NOT
MAKE
BIG
MISFITS
BIT
PSEUDOCOLOR
MORE
OF
A

YOU
HAVE
TO
EMULATE
