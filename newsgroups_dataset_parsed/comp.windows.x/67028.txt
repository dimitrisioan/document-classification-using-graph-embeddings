I
HAVE
A
PECULIAR
COLOR
PROBLEM
WITH
MACX
APPLES
MACINTOSH
X
SERVER
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
OTHERS
HAVE
SEEN
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
ITS
HAPPENED
WITH
THE
CURRENT
VERSION
AND
WITH
VERSION
WHEN
SOME
TYPES
OF
CLIENT
WINDOWS
ARE
DISPLAYED
PARTS
OF
THE
WINDOWS
ARE
IN
THE
WRONG
COLOR
IF
THE
WINDOW
IS
MOVED
SLIGHTLY
FORCING
THE
SERVER
TO
REPAINT
IT
IT
IS
REPAINTED
IN
THE
CORRECT
COLORS
IT
DOESNT
HAPPEN
FOR
XTERM
WINDOWS
BUT
HAS
HAPPENED
FOR
GRAPHIC
WINDOWS
AND
WITH
SOME
MOTIF
CLIENTS
I
EXPECT
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
HERE
IS
THAT
YOUR
COLORMAP
IS
FULL
AND
WHEN
THE
NEW
APPLICATION
STARTS
UP
IT
CANNOT
ADD
THE
COLORS
THAT
IT
NEEDS
TO
THE
COLORMAP
IT
THEREFORE
HAS
TO
PICK
AND
CHOOSE
FROM
THE
EXISTING
COLORS
THIS
MAKES
IT
LOOK
UGLY
UNTIL
ITS
WINDOW
GETS
PRIORITY
THEN
MACX
CHANGES
THE
COLORMAP
SO
THAT
THE
SELECTED
APP
IS
GETTING
THE
EXACT
COLORS
IT
WANTED
BUT
NOW
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
ARE
HAVING
TO
MAKE
DO
WITH
ITS
COLORMAP
THIS
IS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
ALL
COLOR
X
SERVERS
OR
AT
LEAST
ALL
COLOR
XSERVERS
I
HAVE
SEEN
WHEN
THE
DEMANDS
OF
THE
APPLICATIONS
EXCEED
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
COLORMAP
MY
SOLUTION
IS
USUALLY
TO
AVOID
COLORMAPGREEDY
APPS
AND
DISPLAY
APPLICATIONS
WHERE
COLOR
IS
JUST
ICING
ON
THE
CAKE
IN
MONOCHROME
MODE
RATHER
THAN
IN
COLOR

THIS
IS
AN
