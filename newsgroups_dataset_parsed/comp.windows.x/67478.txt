I
USED

SET

LIKE
MANPATH
HELPPATH
ARCH
ETC
IN
MY
LOGIN
FILE
WITH
XDM
THE

NEITHER
THE
OLWM
ROOTWINDOW
NOR
MY
APPLICATIONS
KNOW
ABOUT
THESE

I
USED
THE
RESOURCE

SUCCESFULLY
PASS
THE
PATH
VARIABLE
BUT
I
AM
HAVING
PROBLEMS
PASSING
ANYTHING
ELSE
I
TRIED
EXECING

DIDNT
HELP
I
ALSO
TRIED
USING

WOULD
APPRECIATE
