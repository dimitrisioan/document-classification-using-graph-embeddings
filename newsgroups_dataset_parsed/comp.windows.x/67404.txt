BACKGROUND
PROCESSING
IN
X
APPLICATIONS
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
A
SERVER
PROGRAM
WHICH
MAKES
SOCKET
CONNECTIONS
TO
MANY
NODES
AND
COLLECTS
DATA
FROM
THAT
NODES
PERIODICALLY
I
NEED
TO
DISPLAY
THIS
DATA
ON
MY
X
APPLICATION
I
TRIED
TO
INVOKE
THIS
SERVER
USING
XTADDAPPTIMEOUT
WHICH
WORKS
OK
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
SOME
TIME
THERE
IS
DELAY
IN
COLLECTING
DATA
SO
I
DOESNT
RETURNS
TO
EVENTLOOP
DURING
THAT
TIME
AND
MY
APPLICATION
REMAINS
BUSY
AND
IT
DOESNT
RESPOND
TO
USERS
INPUT
I
BUTTON
PRESS
EVENTS
ARE
QUEUED
AND
EXECTED
AFTER
SERVER
FINISHED
ITS
TASK
NOW
I
AM
GOING
TO
TRY
APPADDINPUT
CALL
SO
THAT
IT
READS
PIPE
ONLY
WHEN
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
TO
READ
IN
PIPE
I
AM
THINKING
OF
CREATING
ONE
PIPE
IN
WHICH
SERVER
WILL
WRITE
AND
CLIENT
WHICH
IS
MY
X
APPLICATION
WILL
READ
NOW
I
HAVE
SOME
DOUBTS
WHICH
YOU
MAY
BE
ABLE
TO
CLARIFY
WHEN
I
FORK
A
PROCESS
IT
WILL
CREATE
TO
COPY
OF
MY
PROCESS
RIGHT
NOW
WHAT
DOES
THIS
TWO
COPIES
MEAN
TWO
SHELLS
WHERE
SHOULD
I
FORK
MY
APPLICATION
WHAT
ARE
THE
RESPONSIBILITIES
OF
THIS
PROCESSES
HOW
SHOULD
I
CALL
THIS
PROCESSES
CAN
I
FORK
MORE
THAN
ONE
PROCESSES
SO
THAT
I
CAN
READ
FROM
MORE
THAN
ONE
SERVERS
INPUT
