how
do
i
make

print
my
application
the
xwd
client
in
the
distributions
can
be
used
to
select
a
window
or
the
background
it
produces
an
xwdformat
file
of
the
image
of
that
window
the
file
can
be
postprocessed
into
something
useful
or
printed
with
the
xpr
client
and
your
local
printing
mechanism
you
can
use
this
command
csh
sleep
xwd
root

and
then
spend
seconds
or
so
setting
up
your

the

that
xwd
also
has
an

there
are
also
unofficial

some

also

the

some

have
local

some
vendors
implementations
of
lpr
eg
sony
include
direct

how
can
i
change
the
titlebar
of
my
xterm
window
the
solution
involves
sending
an
escape
sequence
to
xterm
which
will
cause
it
to
update
the
property
which
the
window
manager
relies
upon
for
the
string
which
appears
in
the
window
titlebar
a
solution
is
as
easy
as
typing
this
in
an
xterm
running
a
shell
echo
where
esc
is
the
escape
key
text
is
the
string
you
wish
to
have
displayed
and
g
is
a
controlg
the
bel
character
here
is
a
more
complicated
csh
alias
which
changes
the
titlebar
to
the
current
working
directory
when
you
change
directories
alias
newcd
cd
echo
n
the
digit
in
these
strings
indicates
to
xterm
that
it
should
change
only
the
title
of
the
window
to
change
both
the
title
and
the
name
used
in
the
icon
use
the
digit
instead
and
use
to
change
only
the
icon
name
note
another
way
to
do
this
which
prevents
an
incorrect
display
of
the
local
directory
if
a
modified
cd
is
used
in
a
subshell
is
to
wrap
the
escape
sequences
into

prompt

note
on

may
be

why
are
my
xterm
menus
so
small
you
are
probably
setting
the
geometry
small
accidentally
if
you
give
a
resource
specification
like
this
xtermgeometry
then
you
are
asking
for
all
widgets
under
xterm
to
have
their
geometry
set
to
for
the
main
window
this
is
ok
as
it
uses
characters
for
its
size
but
its
popup
menus
dont
they
are
in
pixels
and
show
up
small
to
set
only
the
terminal
widget
to
have
the
specified
geometry
name
it
explicitly
subject
how
can
i
print
the
current
selection
you
could
paste
it
into
an
xterm
after
executing
the
lpr
command
however
a
program
by
richard
hesketh
specifically
for
manipulating
the
selection
will
help
eg
xselection
primary
lpr
finds
the
primary
selection
and
prints
it
this
command
can
be
placed
in
a
windowmanager
menu
or
in
shellscripts
xselection
also
permits
the
setting
of
the
selection
and
other
properties
a
version
is
on
export
also
available
is
riaccsuwocapubxgetselectiontarz
which
can
be
adapted
to
do
this

how
does
xt
use
environment
variables
in
loading
resources
you
can
use
several
environment
variables
to
control
how
resources
are
loaded
for
your
xtbased
programs
xfilesearchpath
xuserfilesearchpath
and
xapplresdir
these
environment
variables
control
where
xt
looks
for
applicationdefaults
files
as
an
application
is
initializing
xt
loads
at
most
one
appdefaults
file
from
the
path
defined
in
xfilesearchpath
and
another
from
the
path
defined
in
xuserfilesearchpath
set
xfilesearchpath
if
software
is
installed
on
your
system
in
such
a
way
that
appdefaults
files
appear
in
several
different
directory
hierarchies
suppose
for
example
that
you
are
running
suns
open
windows
and
you
also
have
some
x
applications
installed
in
you
could
set
a
value
like
this
for
xfilesearchpath
and
it
would
cause
xt
to
look
up
appdefaults
files
in
both
and
usropenwinlib
or
wherever
your
openwinhome
is
located
setenv
xfilesearchpath
the
value
of
this
environment
variable
is
a
colonseparated
list
of
pathnames
the
pathnames
contain
replacement
characters
as
follows
see
xtresolvepathname
n
the
value
of
the
filename
parameter
or
the
applications
class
name
t
the
value
of
the
file
type
in
this
case
the
literal
string
appdefaults
c
customization
resource
only
s
suffix
none
for
appdefaults
l
language
locale
and
codeset
eg
jajpeuc
l
language
part
of
l
eg
ja
t
the
territory
part
of
the
displays
language
string
c
the
codeset
part
of
the
displays
language
string
lets
take
apart
the
example
suppose
the
applications
class
name
is
myterm
also
suppose
open
windows
is
installed
in
usropenwin
notice
the
example
omits
localespecific
lookup
means
openwinhomelibtn
means
usropenwinlibappdefaultsmyterm
as
the
application
initializes
xt
tries
to
open
both
of
the
above
appdefaults
files
in
the
order
shown
as
soon
as
it
finds
one
it
reads
it
and
uses
it
and
stops
looking
for
others
the
effect
of
this
path
is
to
search
first
in
then
in
usropenwin
lets
consider
another
example
this
time
lets
set
xuserfilesearchpath
so
it
looks
for
the
file
mytermad
in
the
current
working
directory
then
for
myterm
in
the
directory
appdefaults
setenv
xuserfilesearchpath
nadhomeappdefaultsn
the
first
path
in
the
list
expands
to
mytermad
the
second
expands
to
homeappdefaultsmyterm
this
is
a
convenient
setting
for
debugging
because
it
follows
the
imake
convention
of
naming
the
appdefaults
file
mytermad
in
the
applications
source
directory
so
you
can
run
the
application
from
the
directory
in
which
you
are
working
and
still
have
the
resources
loaded
properly
note
when
looking
for
appdefault
files
with
xuserfilesearchpath
for
some
bizarre
reason
neither
the
type
nor
file
suffix
is
defined
so
t
and
s
are
useless
with
theres
another
twist
you
may
specify
a
customization
resource
value
for
example
you
might
run
the
myterm
application
like
this
myterm
xrm
customization
color
if
one
of
your
pathname
specifications
had
the
value
then
the
expanded
pathname
would
be
because
the
c
substitution
character
takes
on
the
value
of
the
customization
resource
the
default
xfilesearchpath
compiled
into
xt
is
note
some
sites
replace
with
a
projectroot
in
this
batch
of
default
settings
the
default
xuserfilesearchpath
also
compiled
into
xt
is
rootlnc
rootlnc
rootnc
rootln
rootln
rootn
root
is
either
the
value
of
xapplresdir
or
the
users
home
directory
if
xapplresdir
is
not
set
if
you
set
xuserfilesearchpath
to
some
value
other
than
the
default
xt
ignores
xapplresdir
altogether
notice
that
the
quick
and
dirty
way
of
making
your
application
find
your
appdefaults
file
in
your
current
working
directory
is
to
set
xapplresdir
to
a
single
dot
in
all
this
machinery
worked
differently
for
compatibilty
many
people
set
their
xapplresdir
value
to
a
dot
followed
by
a
slash

how
to
i
have
the
xdm
put
a
picture
behind
the
login
window
the
answer
lies
in
changing
xdms
xrdb
resource
in
the
xdmconfig
file
to
run
a
program
to
change
the
background
before
loading
the
resources
for
example
your
file
may
add
the
line
false
to
permit
unrestricted
access
to
the
display
before
login
beware
and
also
displaymanagerxrdb
where
that
file
does
something
for
all
connections
along
the
lines
of
binsh
comes
in
with
arguments
display
load
display
bitmap
substitute
xloadimage
or
xv
for
xsetroot
to
taste
note
that
this
is

hack
that
can
be
used

my

when

runs
your

it

source
your

you
can
set
the
path
explicitly
as
you
normally
could
for

you
can
place
all

in
a
separate

source
it
from
both
the

file
and
your

file

if
you
set
your

in
your

the
normal
place
you
can
make
your

have

by

your

unpacks

installed

your

equivalent

be

to

if
the

use

rehash
so
that
the

actually
found
it
is
this
last
step
that
youre
probably
leaving
out
you
can
also
use

resource

a

not
a

which
is
a
pixmap
of

because
of
this
writing
a
generic
string
to

converter
is
impossible
since
there
is
no
accepted
convention
for

for
pixmaps
therefore
neither
the
x
toolkit
or
the
athena

set
define
a

to

converter
because
there
is
no
converter
you
cannot
specify
this
