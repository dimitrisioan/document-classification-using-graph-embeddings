lost
in
tekhvc
color
space
please
respond
via
email
has
anybody
actually
seen
the
tek
color
space
stuff
working
im
not
having
any
luck
with
either
the
xtici
editor
from
exportlcsmitedu
or
with
oreillys
ftpable
example
xcms
from
ftpuunet
the
oreilly
example
fails
for
almost
every
set
of
inputs
because
xcmstekhvcquerymaxv
returns
a
smaller
value
than
xcmstekhvcqueryminv
does
which
makes
no
sense
to
me
the
xtici
editor
fails
in
xcmsstorecolors
apparently
because
the
mathematical
manipulations
of
the
color
specs
results
in
invalid
values
so
you
cant
actually
edit
any
colors
we
have
patch
level
pseudocolor
visual
ive
poked
around
in
the
xcms
code
in
xlib
but
without
some
understanding
of
the
theory
i
have
no
idea
whats
going
wrong
can
somebody
confirm
if
either
of
the
abovementioned
programs
work
on
their
systems
or
let
me
know
if
they
fail
for
you
too
please
include
what
hardwaresoftwarepatch
levels
you
have
any
hints
please
respond
with
email
as
i
dont
regularly
read
this
group
thanks
