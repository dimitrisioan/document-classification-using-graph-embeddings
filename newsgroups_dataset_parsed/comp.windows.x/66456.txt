im
writing
xwall
a
simple
x
version
of
wall
and
i
want
it
to
put
a
message
up
on
each
of
a
default
list
of
displays
the
problem
is
that
xopendisplay
hangs
if
one
of
the
displays
is
currently
controlled
by
xdm
login
screen
xdm
does
xgrabserver
when
its
running
in
secure
mode
so
do
some
screenlocks
theres
really
no
simple
way
to
tell
this
is
the
case
you
can
take
xdm
out
of
secure
mode
probably
not
too
cool
you
can
wrap
your
call
to
xopendisplay
in
some
code
which
solicts
a
future
sigalrm
and
longjmps
past
the
xopendisplay
from
the
signal
handler
an
example
of
this
can
be
seen
in
the
xdm
sources
note
that
longjmping
out
of
xopendisplay
probably
causes
a
memory
leak
any
program
functioning
this
way
probably
needs
to
exit
regularly
