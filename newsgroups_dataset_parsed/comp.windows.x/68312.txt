hi
could
someone
explain
to
me
what
exactly
the
xlib
functions
xcreateregion
xpolygonregion
xpointinregion
do
or
to
suggest
a
ftp
site
where
i
can
find
programs
using
these
functions
ps
the
man
pages
does
not
explain
much
thank
you

i
use
those
routines
in
a
widget
which
only
redraws
exposed
areas
heres
a
small
piece
of
code
that
uses
those
routines
static
void
redisplaypw
ev
region
xtpmanagerwidget
pw
xexposeevent
ev
region
region
ppexposureregion
is
an
xregion
xtpmanagerpart
pp
pwplotter
ppexposureregion
xcreateregion
region
is
passed
via
an
expose
event
ifregion
null
if
evsendevent
synthetic
event
sent
by
widget
it
wants
a
full
redraw

xunionregion
region

ppexposureregion
stuff

we
need
to
clip
on
expose
region
for
redrawing
the
grid
xsetregionxtdisplayofobjectpw
ppplotareagcppexposureregion
stuff
deleted
check
to
see
if
child
is
exposed
if
xrectinregion
pwplotterexposureregion
childcorex
childcorey
childcorewidth
childcoreheight
so
i
build
up
a
region
of
exposures
so
that
when
i
service
my
container
widget
redraw
of
rectobj
children
i
only
redraw
what
need
to
be
redrawn
it
works
for
me
hope
this
helps
you
