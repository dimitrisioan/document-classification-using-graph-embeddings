RE
MOTIF
VS
ATHENA
ETC
IN
ARTICLE

DAVID
J
HUGHES
WRITES
I
AM
ALSO
CONCERNED
BY
THIS
PREVALENCE
OF
MOTIF
PARTICULARLY
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
WRITING
AND
OBTAINING
FREE
SOFTWARE
AS
THE
LINUX
AND
COMMUNITIES
GROW
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THAT
MOTIF
WILL
LOSE
SOME
OF
ITS
GRIP
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
NONCOMMERCIAL
MARKETPLACE
PORTS
OF
MOTIF
TO
BOTH
AND
LINUX
ARE
AVAILABLE
FOR
A
FEE
OF
ABOUT
THIS
IS
COST
RECOVERY
FOR
THE
PERSON
WHO
BOUGHT
THE
RIGHTS
TO
REDISTRIBUTE
THE
ACTIVITY
IN
BOTH
THE
BSD
AND
LINUX
NEWS
GROUPS
PERTAINING
TO
MOTIF
HAS
BEEN
HIGH
I
JUST
WONDER
IF
THIS
WILL
ALSO
CAUSE
A
DIVERGENCE
BETWEEN
COMMERCIAL
AND
NONCOMMERCIAL
SOFTWARE
IE
YOU
WILL
ONLY
GET
FREE
SOFTWARE
USING
ATHENA
OR
OPENLOOK
WIDGET
SETS
AND
ONLY
GET
COMMERCIAL
SOFTWARE
USING
THE
MOTIF
WIDGET
SETS
I
CANT
SEE
WHY
IF
JUST
ABOUT
EVERY
WORKSTATION
WILL
COME
WITH
MOTIF
BY
DEFAULT
AND
YOU
CAN
BUY
IT
FOR
UNDER
FOR
THE
FREE
UNIX
PLATFORMS
I
CANT
SEE
THIS
CAUSING
MAJOR
PROBLEMS
I
THINK
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
THE
ACTIVE
LINUX
AND
COMMUNITIES
ARE
POPULATED
BY
ENTHUSIASTS
WHO
WOULD
OBJECT
TO
PAYING
ANY
MONEY
FOR
SOFTWARE
OTHERWISE
THEY
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
GONE
FOR
A
COMMERCIAL
UNIX
AN
IMPORTANT
FACTOR
IN
THE
LINUX
COMMUNITY
IS
THAT
SOURCE
CODE
IS
ALWAYS
AVAILABLE
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
SIMILAR
IN
THE
COMMUNITY
HOWEVER
IM
NOT
REALLY
INVOLVED
THERE
MANY
PEOPLE
USING
LINUX
LIKE
TO
STAY
AT
THE
CUTTING
BLEEDING
EDGE
IE
WHEN
KERNEL
PATCHES
C
LIBRARY
OR
COMPILER
PATCHES
COME
OUT
PEOPLE
LIKE
TO
REBUILD
THEIR
ENTIRE
SYSTEMS
THE
PRIME
REQUIREMENT
FOR
ALL
LINUX
SOFTWARE
IS
THAT
IT
IS
AVAILABLE
UNDER
A
GNU
STYLE
PUBLIC
LICENSE
HENCE
LINUX
SOFTWARE
USES
EITHER
THE
ATHENA
WIDGETS
OR
XVIEW
INDIVIDUALS
MAY
WRITE
SOFTWARE
REQUIRING
MOTIF
BUT
I
DOUBT
IT
IS
WIDELY
ADOPTED
