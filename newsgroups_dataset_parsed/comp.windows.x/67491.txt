it
is
interesting
to
look
at
the
changes
of
mind
that

had
very
interested
indeed
this
is
against
this

the
gnu
copyleft
is
protecting
us
anyway
at
simulog
we
will
abandon
xv
we
were
using
it
mostly
for
slide
shows
because
of
its
loop
feature
that
display
does
not
have
display
from
the
wonderful
imagemagick
package
d

i
think
i
will
implement
it
myself
even
a
shellscript
should
do
the
job
and
forget
xv
