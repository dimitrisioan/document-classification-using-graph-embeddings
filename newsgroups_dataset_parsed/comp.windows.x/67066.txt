xdmxsession
woes
ive
just
managed
to
get
xdm
running
from
an
ncr
an
box
running
to
my
ncd
xdisplay
its
pretty
much
working
but
im
encountering
a
weird
error
im
attempting
to
start
an
xterm
from
my
xsession
file
but
nothing
happens
redirecting
stderr
to
a
file
using
exec
in
xsession
reveals
the
error
message
xterm
error
errno
not
owner
now
if
i
start
xterm
from
the
window
manager
or
from
the
command
line
it
works
fine
and
starting
other
clients
like
the
window
manager
mwm
and
a
clock
from
my
xsession
also
works
anyone
encountered
this

it

to
be
smart
