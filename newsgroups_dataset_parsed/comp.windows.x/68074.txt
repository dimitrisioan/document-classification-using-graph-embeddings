HAVE
A
QUESTION
WHICH
IS
NOT
DIRECTLY
RELATED
TO
X
SCREEN
SAVER
WHAT
X
SCREEN
SAVER
DOES
IS
TO
BLANK
THE
SCREEN
IF
IT
HAS
BEEN
IDLE
FOR
SOME
TIME
I
DONT
WANT
MY
SCREEN
TO
GO
BLANK
BUT
TO
GET
LOCKED
OR
CALL
XLOCK
PROGRAM
IS
THERE
A
PARALLEL
CALL
TO
XSETSCREENSAVER
WHICH
LOCKS
MY
SCREEN
OR
CALL
MY
LOCK
PROGRAM
AFTER
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
IDLE

OR
