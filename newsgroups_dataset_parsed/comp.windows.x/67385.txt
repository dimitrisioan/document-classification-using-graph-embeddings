callback
parameter
problem
after
upgrade
weve
just
recently
upgraded
our
to
and
are
now
running
into
problems
with
some
of
our
applications
that
use
motif
it
appears
that
pointer
to
the
widget
being
passed
to
the
callback
function
ie
the
w
of
w
client
call
is
nil
the
client
and
call
pointers
are
okay
in
some
instances
but
bogus
in
other
instances
we
are
running
sunos
on
a
sun
after
compiling
and
all
patches
with
the
motifbc
flag
set
we
recompiled
motif
and
then
we
recompiled
the
application
did
we
skip
a
step
or
leave
something
out
is
there
a
flag
that
we
should
have
used
should
we
have
left
motif
alone
any
answers
or
suggestions
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks
