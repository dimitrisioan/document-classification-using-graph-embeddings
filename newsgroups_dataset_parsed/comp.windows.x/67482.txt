XDM
XKERNEL
AND
OLWM
GREETINGS
WE
HAVE
A
NETWORK
OF
SUN
WORKSTATIONS
RUNNING
SUNOS
AND
OPENWINDOWS
OF
THESE
ARE
SUN
THAT
WE
HAVE
MODIFIED
TO
RUN
SETH
ROBERTSONS
XKERNEL
IMAGE
EFFECTIVELY
TURNING
THEM
INTO
XTERMINALS
WE
USE
XDM
TO
MANAGE
THE
DISPLAYS
WHEN
WE
HAD
XKERNEL
MACHINES
THINGS
WORKED
FINE
BUT
WHEN
WE
INSTALLED
MORE
LAST
WEEKEND
WE
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
FOUND
A
WEAKNESS
WITH
CLIENTS
TO
SPARC
THE
SPARC
WINDOW
MANAGER
IS
EVENTUALLY
GETTING
MUNGED
LET
ME
TRY
TO
BE
PRECISE
THE
USER
SITTING
AT
THE
MACHINE
THAT
DOES
ALL
THE
ACTUAL
PROCESSING
FOR
THESE
XTERMINALS
IS
HAVING
CONTROL
OF
HIS
KEYBOARD
AND
SCREEN
YANKED
AWAY
WHEN
THIS
WAS
THE
DEPARTMENT
CHAIR
IT
WAS
KIND
OF
CUTE
WE
POKED
AT
XDM
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
AND
ARE
SATISFIED
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
AT
FAULT
OUR
CURRENT
THEORY
IS
THAT
OLWM
THE
SUN
VERSION
WAS
NOT
MEANT
FOR
RUNNING
MULTIPLE
COPIES
ON
ONE
MACHINE
WHICH
IS
WHAT
HAPPENS
THE
CONSOLE
USER
RUNS
OLWM
AND
EVERY
XTERMINAL
LOGGED
IN
HAS
OLWM
RUNNING
ON
THE
XTERMINAL
SERVER
HAS
ANYONE
HAD
ANY
PRIOR
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THIS
SORT
OF
BEHAVIOR
CAN
ANYONE
SHOOT
OBVIOUS
HOLES
IN
THIS
THEORY
HOW
ABOUT
OBVIOUS
GIMMES
AND
OF
COURSE
ANY
IDEAS
ON
HOW
TO
SOLVE
IT
ANY
IDEAS
ARE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
