RE
FORCING
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
TO
ACCEPT
SPECIFIC
COORDINATES
FOR
A
WINDOW
IN
ARTICLE
RICHARD
VERHOEVEN
WRITES
SORRY
BUT
OLWM
AND
TVTWM
DONT
DO
IT
THEY
PLACE
THE
TITLE
AT
THAT
POSITION
AND
THE
WINDOW
AT
A
POSITION
BELOW
IT
THIS
BECOMES
A
PROBLEM
WHEN
YOU
WANT
A
PROGRAM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
SAVE
ITS
CURRENT
CONFIGURATION
AND
RESTORE
IS
LATER
CURRENTLY
MY
SOLUTION
IS
XCREATEWINDOW
XSETWMPROPERTIES
XMAPWINDOW
XFLUSH
XMOVEWINDOW
IT
WORKS
WITH
OLWM
BUT
IS
LESS
THAN
ELEGANT
ALL
THIS
LEAVES
ME
WONDERING
IF
IM
OVERLOOKING
SOMETHING
OBVIOUS
RICHARD
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
MWM
HAS
AN
RESOURCE
TO
SPECIFY
IF
POSITIONS
ARE
TO
BE
USED
FOR
THE
BORDER
OF
A
WINDOW
OR
FOR
THE
USER
WINDOW
MAYBE
OTHER
WINDOW
MANAGERS
HAVE
SIMILAR
OPTIONS
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
USER
WINDOW
POSITION
AND
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATION
WINDOW
POSITION
IS
TO
SUBTRACT
THEIR
POSITIONS
YOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
USE
XQUERYTREE
AND
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATIONS
WINDOW
IS
THE
PARENT
OF
YOUR
WINDOW
UNFORTUNATELY
YOU
CAN
ONLY
FIGURE
OUT
THE
DECORATION
WIDTH
AND
HEIGHT
AFTER
THE
WINDOW
HAS
BEEN
MAPPED
THIS
WAY
GREETING
