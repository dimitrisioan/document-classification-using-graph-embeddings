this
is
a
simple
x
graphics
question
assume
you
have
a
valid
window
w
an
icon
pixmap
and
the
background
mask
also
a
pixmap
for
that
icon
you
wish
to
place
the
icon
at
xy
in
w
without
the
background
question
what
combination
of
xcopyarea
and
gc
functions
are
necessary
i
think
the
idea
is
to
merge
only
those
pixels
of
pixmap
into
w
as
indicated
by
the
corresponding
mask
pixel
value
specifically
the
problem
involves
a
pixmap
and
mask
generated
by
the
xpm
libs
any
clues
would
be
most
appreciated
xpm
provides
you
with
symbolic
color
names
which
can
be
specified
at
load
time
so
for
doing
what
you
want
i
would
suggest
you
to
define
a
background
symbol
in
your
pixmap
file
which
youll
set
to
whatever
color
is
used
by
the
widget
or
the
window
on
which
you
want
to
put
your
pixmap
this
would
surely
be
the
simplest
and
fastest
way
to
do
what
you
want
no
as
soon
as
you
blit
two
of
this
icons
once
on
top
of
the
other
with
a
little
dislocation
you
see
the
rectangular
blit
crashes
too
much
of
the
icon
first
blitted
because
it
draws
a
full
rectangle
the
way
to
do
it
is
masking
create
a
bitmap
with
all
pixels
to
be
merged
are
and
all
not
to
be
merged
are
then
set
the
clipmask
of
the
gc
to
this
bitmap
set
the
clipxorigin
and
clipyorigin
of
the
gc
to
the
xy
coordinates
where
you
blit
the
icon
to
the
destination
drawable
use
gxcopy
and
xcopyarea
the
icon
pixmap
to
the
destination
drawable
using
this
gc
