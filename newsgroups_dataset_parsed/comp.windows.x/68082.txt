XM
IS
A
USER
INTERFACE
FRAMEWORK
FOR
THE
C
LANGUAGE
BUILT
UPON
AND
THE
XTOOLKIT
IT
IS
DESIGNED
TO
BE
A
SIMPLE
AND
INTUITIVE
PROGRAMMING
INTERFACE
TO
ACCESS
THE
FUNCTIONALITY
OF
COMMONLY
USED
WIDGETS
XM
WAS
INITIALLY
CREATED
FOR
THE
MOTIF
WIDGET
SET
NOW
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
ATHENA
WIDGETS
WAS
ADDED
APPLICATIONS
CREATED
WITH
XM
RUN
IN
BOTH
ENVIRONMENTS
WITHOUT
CHANGES
ALTHOUGH
MANY
NICE
FEATURES
ARE
ONLY
AVAILABLE
WHEN
USING
MOTIF
IN
SOME
SITUATIONS
XM
EXTENDS
THE
UNDERLYING
TOOLKIT
IE
PROVIDING
A
COMBOBOX
BORROWED
FROM

NEVER
TRIES

REPLACE
IT
DATA

LEFT

AND
ONLY
DUPLICATED
IN

XM
HAS
NOTHING
COMMON
WITH
MOTIF
BESIDES
THE
GENERAL
IDEA
TO
ENCAPSULATE
MOTIF
WIDGETS
IN
C
OBJECTS
AND
THE
IN

MANY
IDEAS
FOR
THE
XM

WHICH
PROVIDES
AN
EASY

USE
FRAMEWORK
FOR

APPLICATIONS
IN
THE
VERY
FIRST
TIME
OF

I
USED
THE

TO
CREATE
SIMILAR

CAN

A
VERY
SIMPLIFIED
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
SOME

FROM
THE
COMMONINTERACT
SYSTEM
RESEARCH

OF
OUR
INSTITUTE
IN
AN
APPROACH
TO
DEFINE
A

IF
YOU
ARE
INTERRESTED
LOOK
INTO
THE
JUNE
ISSUE
OF
THE
JOOP
SIGS
PUBLICATIONS
JOURNAL
OF
OBJECT
ORIENTED
PROGRAMMING
THERE
SHOULD
BE
OUR
PAPER
ABOUT
COMMONINTERACT
BUT
BE
AWARE
THAT
IT
IS
OUR
STATE
OF
THE
ART
FROM
COMMONINTERACTII
IS
STILL
UNDOCUMENTED
AND
IS
INCLUDED
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
USED
TO
IMPLEMENT
THE
DIALOG
EDITOR
IT
CURRENTLY
SUPPORTS
ONLY
DRAWING
PRIMITIVES
LINES
RECTANGLES
CIRCLES
BUT
WE
PLAN
TO
EXTEND
IT
TO
SUPPORT
BITMAPS
AND
SOME
CONTROLS
ALSO
KNOWN
PROBLEM
THE
XM
DRAWING
CLASS
HAS
NO
REDRAWING
STRATEGY
ALWAYS
REDRAWS
THE
WHOLE
WINDOW
EVEN
AFTER
MINIMAL
CHANGES
LIKE
SELECTING
AN
OBJECT
THIS
LOOKS
VERY
UGLY
ON
SLOW
DISPLAYS
AND
SHOULD
BE
FIXED
ABOUT
THIS
FIRST
RELEASE
XM
IS
STILL
INCOMPLETE
AND
HAS
A
LOT
OF
BUGS
BUT
WE
ARE
USING
IT
HERE
FOR
SMALLER
APPLICATIONS
WHICH
ARE
RUNNING
WITHOUT
PROBLEMS
SO
I
THINK
I
CAN
CALL
IT
A
BETA
RELEASE
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
TO
DEVELOP
APPLICATIONS
FOR
ANY
NONCRITICAL
PURPOSES
COMMONINTERACT
MAY
BE
CALLED
A
PRE
ALPHA
RELEASE
ITS
DEVELOPMENT
WILL
BE
CONTINUED
THIS
YEAR
BECAUSE
WE
PLAN
TO
USE
IT
FOR
ANOTHER
RESEARCH
PROJECT
HERE
BESIDES
INCOMPLETENESS
AND
THE
REDRAWING
PROBLEM
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
