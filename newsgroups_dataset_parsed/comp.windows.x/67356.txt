I
HAVE
SEEN
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
USING
A
SPARCSTATION
SOLARIS
OW
IN
MY
CASE
IT
HAPPENS
FAR
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
PERIODICALLY
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THERES
A
CORRESPONDING
PATCH
FOR
SOLARIS
BUT
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
THE
FOLLOWING
BUG
WHICH
IS
SUPPOSEDLY
FIXED
IN
THE
SOLARIS
OLWM
JUMBO
PATCH
WINDOW
SYSTEM
CAN
HANG
IN
AN
ERRANT
POINTER
GRAB
ACTUALLY
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
OW
PROBLEM
MAY
BE
DIFFERENT
SINCE
THE
README
FILE
SAYS
THAT
THIS
PATCH
IS
JUST
A
SUNOS
VERSION
OF
THE
OW
OLWM
BUT
MAYBE
THAT
LINE
CAME
FROM
AN
EARLIER
VERSION
OF
THE
PATCH
AND
THEY
FORGOT
TO
TAKE
IT
OUT

THE
