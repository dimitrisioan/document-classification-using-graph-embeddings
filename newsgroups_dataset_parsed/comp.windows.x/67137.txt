events
store
and
reply
of
mouse
and
keyboard
events
to
produce
regression
tests
or
automatic
demos
we
would
like
to
store
all
mouse
and
keyboard
events
produced
by
a
user
it
should
be
possible
to
filter
the
mouse
and
keyboard
events
from
the
servers
queue
an
to
store
them
in
a
file
this
sequence
of
events
stored
in
a
file
should
be
given
to
the
servers
queue
as
if
a
user
is
working
exists
a
tool
that
is
capable
to
save
and
reply
all
mouse
and
keyboard
events
where
where
one
can
catch
these
events
to
store
them
in
our
case
the
servers
queue
is
on
a
x
terminal
hp
where
can
we
catch
all
events
coming
from
a
given
server
if
this
is
not
possible
can
we
catch
all
events
given
to
a
certain
client
and
how
where
one
can
send
a
stored
sequence
of
events
to
simulate
a
user
is
there
a
central
dispatcher
on
the
clients
machine
who
manages
all
incoming
events
from
a
given
server
and
how
can
we
reach
it
thanks
in
advance
