but
your
performance
will
suck
lemons
running
an
xserver
on
a
clone
i
have
a
clone
almost
with
no
name
generating
xstones
on
a
system
i
can
get
tektronix
terminals
for
under
and
the
performance
is
over
xstones
you
will
not
come
even
close
to
the
performance
of
an
series
plus
you
excuse
me
but
with
a
cache
isa
card
running
you
can
get
xstones
at
which
i
doubt
this
is
hardly
apples
to
apples
try
running
the
benchmark
over
a
network
to
the
clone
and
and
if
youre
still
getting
xstones
then
youve
got
a
good
machine
x
terminals
arent
just
a
server
you
know

i
would
further
add
that
a
is
going
to
cost
way
more
than
probably
color
makes
it
not
applesapples
too
xterminals
provide
better
priceperformance
than
pcs
you
can
make
a
pc
much
cheaper
and
perform
much
worse
and
you
can
make
pcs
perform
great
and
cost
more
you
pay
extra
for
the
additional
functinality
and
expandability
of
a
pc
for
home
user
that
extra
functionality
is
worth
the
added
cost
