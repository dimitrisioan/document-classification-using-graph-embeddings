WRITES
BUT
YOUR
PERFORMANCE
WILL
SUCK
LEMONS
RUNNING
AN
XSERVER
ON
A
CLONE
I
HAVE
A
CLONE
ALMOST
WITH
NO
NAME
GENERATING
XSTONES
ON
A
SYSTEM
I
CAN
GET
TEKTRONIX
TERMINALS
FOR
UNDER
AND
THE
PERFORMANCE
IS
OVER
XSTONES
YOU
WILL
NOT
COME
EVEN
CLOSE
TO
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
AN
SERIES
PLUS
YOU
EXCUSE
ME
BUT
WITH
A
CACHE
ISA
CARD
RUNNING
YOU
CAN
GET
XSTONES
AT
WHICH
I
DOUBT
THIS
IS
HARDLY
APPLES
TO
APPLES
TRY
RUNNING
THE
BENCHMARK
OVER
A
NETWORK
TO
THE
CLONE
AND
AND
IF
YOURE
STILL
GETTING
XSTONES
THEN
YOUVE
GOT
A
GOOD
MACHINE
X
TERMINALS
ARENT
JUST
A
SERVER
YOU
KNOW
GRAEME
GILL
I
WOULD
FURTHER
ADD
THAT
A
IS
GOING
TO
COST
WAY
MORE
THAN
PROBABLY
COLOR
MAKES
IT
NOT
APPLESAPPLES
TOO
XTERMINALS
PROVIDE
BETTER
PRICEPERFORMANCE
THAN
PCS
YOU
CAN
MAKE
A
PC
MUCH
CHEAPER
AND
PERFORM
MUCH
WORSE
AND
YOU
CAN
MAKE
PCS
PERFORM
GREAT
AND
COST
MORE
YOU
PAY
EXTRA
FOR
THE
ADDITIONAL
FUNCTINALITY
AND
EXPANDABILITY
OF
A
PC
FOR
HOME
USER
THAT
EXTRA
FUNCTIONALITY
IS
WORTH
THE
ADDED
COST
