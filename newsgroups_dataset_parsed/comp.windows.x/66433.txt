lastmodified
subject
where
can
i
get
patches
to
the
release
of
new
public
patches
by
the
mit
x
consortium
is
announced
in
the
compwindowsxannounce
newsgroup
patches
themselves
are
available
via
ftp
from
export
and
from
other
sites
from
which
is
available
they
are
now
also
distributed
through
the
newsgroup
compsourcesx
some
source
resellers
may
be
including
patches
in
their
source
distributions
of
people
without
ftp
access
can
use
the
xstuff
mail
server
it
now
has
patches
for
send
to
xstuffexpolcsmitedu
the
subject
line
send
fixes
where
is
the
name
of
the
patch
and
is
usually
just
the
number
of
the
patch
here
are
a
few
complications
fix
is
in
four
parts
you
need
to
request
and
separately
the
file
sungxuu
which
was
part
of
an
earlier
patch
was
rereleased
with
patch
note
the
file
doesnt
work
with
solaris
fix
is
in
two
parts
and
fix
is
in
three
parts
and
fix
is
in
two
parts
and
fix
replaces
the
for
the
x
test
suite
which
previously
was
optional
fix
also
needs
pexlibtarz
which
you
can
obtain
from
xstuff
by
asking
for
fix
is
in
parts
through
subject
what
is
the
xstuff
mailarchive
the
xstuff
server
is
a
mailresponse
program
that
means
that
you
mail
it
a
request
and
it
mails
back
the
response
any
of
the
four
possible
commands
must
be
the
first
word
on
a
line
the
xstuff
server
reads
your
entire
message
before
it
does
anything
so
you
can
have
several
different
commands
in
a
single
message
unless
you
ask
for
help
the
xstuff
server
treats
the
subject
header
line
just
like
any
other
line
of
the
message
the
archives
are
organized
into
a
series
of
directories
and
subdirectories
each
directory
has
an
index
and
each
subdirectory
has
an
index
the
toplevel
index
gives
you
an
overview
of
what
is
in
the
subdirectories
and
the
index
for
each
subdirectory
tells
you
what
is
in
it
the
command
help
or
send
help
causes
the
server
to
send
you
a
more
detailed
version
of
this
help
file
if
your
message
contains
a
line
whose
first
word
is
index
then
the
server
will
send
you
the
toplevel
index
of
the
contents
of
the
archive
if
there
are
other
words
on
that
line
that
match
the
name
of
subdirectories
then
the
indexes
for
those
subdirectories
are
sent
instead
of
the
toplevel
index
for
example
you
can
say
send
index
fixes
or
index
fixes
a
message
that
requests
an
index
cannot
request
data
if
your
message
contains
a
line
whose
first
word
is
send
then
the
xstuff
server
will
send
you
the
items
named
on
the
rest
of
the
line
to
name
an
item
you
give
its
directory
and
its
name
for
example
send
fixes
you
may
issue
multiple
send
requests
the
xstuff
server
contains
many
safeguards
to
ensure
that
it
is
not
monopolized
by
people
asking
for
large
amounts
of
data
the
mailer
is
set
up
so
that
it
will
send
no
more
than
a
fixed
amount
of
data
each
day
if
the
work
queue
contains
more
requests
than
the
days
quota
then
the
unsent
files
will
not
be
processed
until
the
next
day
whenever
the
mailer
is
run
to
send
its
days
quota
it
sends
the
requests
out
shortestfirst
some
mailers
produce
mail
headers
that
are
unusable
for
extracting
return
addresses
if
you
use
such
a
mailer
you
wont
get
any
response
if
you
happen
to
know
an
explicit
path
you
can
include
a
line
like
path
foobarbitnetmitvmamitedu
or
path
barfoofrotz
in
the
body
of
your
message
and
the
daemon
will
use
it
the
xstuff
server
itself
can
be
