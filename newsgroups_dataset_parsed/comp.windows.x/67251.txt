X
TOOLKITS
I
AM
CONSIDERING
MAKING
A
REASONABLY
LARGE
APPLICATION
FOR
FREE
DISTRIBUTION
PROBABLY
COPYLEFTED
I
AM
GOING
TO
USE
X
NOW
IM
BEWILDERED
BY
THE
HUGE
NUMBER
OF
STANDARDS
THAT
OPEN
SYSTEMS
HAS
CREATED
IVE
LIVED
IN
A
FAIRLY
TOOKITSHELTERED
ENVIRONMENT
MOST
OF
THE
TOOLS
HERE
WERE
PRODUCED
WITH
THE
ATHENA
WIDGET
SET
OR
X
INTRINSICS
OR
XW
IN
MY
HUMBLE
OPINION
THEY
LOOK
LIKE
CRAP
I
DONT
KNOW
HOWEVER
IF
THIS
IS
A
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
THE
TOOKITS
OR
JUST
POOR
AESTETIC
TASTE
IN
THE
PROGRAMMERS
I
WOULD
LIKE
MY
APP
TO
LOOK
A
LITTLE
MORE
SCULPTURED
LIKE
MWM
I
UNDERSTAND
HOWEVER
THAT
MWM
ISNT
FREE
LIKE
THE
OTHER
TOOKITS
I
AM
GETTING
LINUX
SO
I
WILL
HAVE
INTERVIEWS
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
IT
WILL
LOOK
I
GET
THE
IMPRESSION
ANDREW
IS
FROM
THE
FSF
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
EITHER
IF
YOU
CAN
HELP
EXPLAIN
THIS
TOOLKIT
MESS
TO
ME
I
WOULD
BE
MUCH
OBLIGED
WHICH
ARE
FREE
WHICH
ARE
THE
BEST
WHICH
ARE
PORTABLE
WHICH
LOOKS
NICE
WHICH
IS
NOT
A
RESOURCE
HOG
ALSO
IF
YOU
HAPPEN
TO
KNOW
WHICH
ARE
AVAILABLE
ON
LINUX
ANDOR
SUN
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
BIG
HELP
TOO
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
