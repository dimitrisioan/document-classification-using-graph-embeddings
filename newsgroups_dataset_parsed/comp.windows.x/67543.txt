three
qs
is
it
reliable
i
use
it
all
day
every
day
maintaining
our
ftp
site
and
answering
mail
via
supportqdeckcom
and
i
can
honestly
say
that
in
the
last
few
months
ive
never
had
my
machine
go
down
due
to
any
sort
of
tcpip
network
manager
instability
of
course
ive
crashed
my
machine
quite
a
few
times
on
purpose
during
beta
testing
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
the
tcpip
portion
is
quite
stable
however
keep
in
mind
that
dvx
and
the
network
managers
are
only
going
to
be
as
stable
as
the
software
they
sit
on
top
of
so
if
your
underlying
network
kernel
is
flakey
you
cant
expect
dvx
to
be
terribly
stable
how
does
it
send
the
information
from
a
ms
windows
app
over
the
protocol
does
it
just
draw
everything
as
graphics
into
one
window
or
does
it
use
multiple
windows
and
essentially
work
more
cleverly
it
just
goes
as
a
window
that
has
graphics
drawn
into
it
to
vastly
oversimplify
what
goes
on
we
just
take
the
windows
graphics
api
calls
and
translate
them
directly
to
xprotocol
unfortunately
windows
was
not
really
written
to
be
networkaware
so
sometimes
we
see
a
speed
penalty
when
an
app
does
something
stupid
like
sending
a
big
white
bitmap
to
erase
something
rather
than
just
drawing
a
white
box
fortunately
that
sort
of
thing
is
rare
if
i
want
to
run
ms
word
for
example
remotely
do
i
have
to
run
a
separate
copy
of
ms
windows
remotely
and
then
start
ms
word
from
that
or
can
ms
word
be
started
remotely
on
its
own
you
need
to
run
ms
windows
which
word
then
runs
inside
you
could
run
multiple
windows
programs
within
the
one
winx
window
and
windows
has
ways
to
automagically
start
winapps
when
you
start
windows
so
in
practice
its
not
really
a
major
problem
i
have
my
system
set
up
so
that
i
can
run
winx
which
automatically
starts
word
fullscreen
for
windows
so
i
never
see
any
part
of
windows
but
