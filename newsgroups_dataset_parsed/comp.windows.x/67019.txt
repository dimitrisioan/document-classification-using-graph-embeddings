drawing
lines
inversexor
im
trying
to
write
some
code
that
lets
me
draw
lines
and
do
rubberband
boxes
in
motifx
im
running
on
an
display
for
which
ive
created
a
colormap
and
am
using
almost
all
of
the
colors
i
want
to
draw
the
lines
in
a
drawing
area
widget
a
widget
in
which
im
displaying
a
bitmap
using
xputimage
if
doesnt
matter
if
the
lines
i
draw
interactively
stay
around
when
the
window
is
refreshed
currently
to
draw
interactively
i
begin
with
drawindex
is
an
colortable
index
i
reserve
for
the
foreground
mydefaultbgcolor
is
the
color
index
for
the
background
of
my
image

xsetforeground
mydisplay
gc
drawindex
then
to
draw
i
do
xdrawline
mydisplay
xtwindow
gc
xflush
mydisplay
and
when
im
all
done
to
return
things
to
normal
i
do
xsetfunction
mydisplay
gc
gxcopy
what
id
like
to
happen
is
for
the
lines
i
draw
to
be
the
inverse
of
whatever
im
drawing
over
instead
what
happens
is
i
get
white
lines
if
the
lines
are
over
a
white
background
nothing
shows
up
if
the
lines
are
over
a
black
area
nothing
shows
up
its
very
strange
but
the
gxxor
function
seems
right
since
if
i
do
a
rubberbanding
box
it
erases
and
redraws
itself
correctly
ie
not
disturbing
the
underlying
image
any
suggestions
what
im
doing
wrong
