xmdrawingarea
for
drawing
with
xlib
but
i
would
like
to
take
advantage
of
the
graphics
library
gl
available
on
our
ibm
sgis
gl
i
believe
is
it
possible
to
mix
x
and
gl
in
one
application
program
can
i
use
gl
subroutines
in
an
xmdrawingarea
or
in
an
x
window
opened
by
me
with
xopenwindow
you
cant
make
gl
calls
in
an
xmdrawingarea
widget
for
sure
there
is
a
widget
already
defined
for
gl
it
is
the
glxmdraw
motif
or
glxdraw
athena
widget
it
is
similar
to
a
xmdrawingarea
except
that
it
allows
you
to
use
gl
calls
to
render
into
the
window
look
at
glxlink
glxunlink
glxgetconfig
and
glxwinset
in
the
man
pages
the
glxmdraw
widget
works
pretty
well
opengl
will
be
an
improvement
i
can
vouch
for
that
the
gl
widget
works
pretty
well
i
have
been
using
it
for
sometime
now
im
not
sure
though
whether
you
can
use
xlib
calls
to
draw
into
the
gl
widget
i
havent
tried
it
yet
nor
have
i
read
the
accompanying
documentation
completely
try
posting
to
compsyssgi
for
more
information
better
stillyou
will
find
most
of
the
answers
in
the
sgi
manuals
there
is
a
little
transition
guide
which
explains
the
mixedmodel
programming
paradigmmixing
x
and
gl
does
pex
graphigs
have
the
same
functionality
of
gl
i
think
gl
is
a
little
easier
to
use
and
a
little
more
powerful
but
thats
just
an
opinion
mileage
may
vary
well
pex
is
designed
as
an
extension
to
x
and
will
be
more
seamless
but
then
it
is
buggy
to
start
with
opinions
again
