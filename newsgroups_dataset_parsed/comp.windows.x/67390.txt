connecting
a
digitiser
to
x
repost
hi
there
i
posted
this
to
compwindowsxintrinsics
but
got
no
response
so
im
posting
here
im
wanting
to
connect
a
digitiser
made
for
pcs
into
my
workstation
an
hp
it
is
my
understanding
the
x
windows
can
understand
a
variety
of
input
devices
including
digitiser
tablets
however
this
digitiser
makes
use
of
the
serial
port
so
there
would
seem
to
be
a
need
to
have
a
special
device
driver
the
hp
manual
pages
say
that
the
hp
x
server
will
accept
x
input
from
devices
listed
in
the
file
display
number
i
shouldnt
think
i
would
be
able
to
simply
insert
as
an
input
device
in
this
file
and
expect
a
digitiser
to
work
but
maybe
im
wrong
am
i
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
does
anybody
out
there
have
a
digitiser
connected
to
their
workstation
for
use
as
a
pointer
for
x
rather
than
just
as
input
to
a
specific
x
application
if
so
what
were
the
steps
required
for
installation
did
you
need
a
special
device
driver
did
the
manufacturer
supply
it
are
there
generic
public
domain
device
drivers
around
i
understand
that
digitisers
generally
use
only
a
couple
of
standard
formats
any
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
cheers
