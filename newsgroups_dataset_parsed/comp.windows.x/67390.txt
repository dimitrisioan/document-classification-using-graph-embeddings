CONNECTING
A
DIGITISER
TO
X
REPOST
HI
THERE
I
POSTED
THIS
TO
COMPWINDOWSXINTRINSICS
BUT
GOT
NO
RESPONSE
SO
IM
POSTING
HERE
IM
WANTING
TO
CONNECT
A
DIGITISER
MADE
FOR
PCS
INTO
MY
WORKSTATION
AN
HP
IT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THE
X
WINDOWS
CAN
UNDERSTAND
A
VARIETY
OF
INPUT
DEVICES
INCLUDING
DIGITISER
TABLETS
HOWEVER
THIS
DIGITISER
MAKES
USE
OF
THE
SERIAL
PORT
SO
THERE
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
A
NEED
TO
HAVE
A
SPECIAL
DEVICE
DRIVER
THE
HP
MANUAL
PAGES
SAY
THAT
THE
HP
X
SERVER
WILL
ACCEPT
X
INPUT
FROM
DEVICES
LISTED
IN
THE
FILE
DISPLAY
NUMBER
I
SHOULDNT
THINK
I
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
SIMPLY
INSERT
AS
AN
INPUT
DEVICE
IN
THIS
FILE
AND
EXPECT
A
DIGITISER
TO
WORK
BUT
MAYBE
IM
WRONG
AM
I
WHAT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IS
DOES
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
HAVE
A
DIGITISER
CONNECTED
TO
THEIR
WORKSTATION
FOR
USE
AS
A
POINTER
FOR
X
RATHER
THAN
JUST
AS
INPUT
TO
A
SPECIFIC
X
APPLICATION
IF
SO
WHAT
WERE
THE
STEPS
REQUIRED
FOR
INSTALLATION
DID
YOU
NEED
A
SPECIAL
DEVICE
DRIVER
DID
THE
MANUFACTURER
SUPPLY
IT
ARE
THERE
GENERIC
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
DEVICE
DRIVERS
AROUND
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
DIGITISERS
GENERALLY
USE
ONLY
A
COUPLE
OF
STANDARD
FORMATS
ANY
HELP
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
