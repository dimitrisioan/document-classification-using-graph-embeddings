i
am
having
a
big
problem
trying
to
build
mit
with
xlc
the
one
bundled
with
aix
its
almost
the
linker
is
not
working
properly
with
shared
libraries
ive
built
with
no
problem
before
but
now
its
all
headaches
for
example
the
xset
client
complains
that
libxmu
doesnt
have
a
bunch
of
xt
routines
and
shro
is
missing
or
something
like
that
the
build
of
libxmu
does
link
in
libxt
so
i
am
really
perplexed
what
is
going
on
following
up
on
this
the
specific
error
i
get
is
could
not
load
