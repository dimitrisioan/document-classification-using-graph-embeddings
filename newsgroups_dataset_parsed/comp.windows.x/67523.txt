xarchie
icon
problems
hi
ive
just
installed
the
new
xarchie
and
it
all
works
fine
except
on
our
grayscale
xterm
the
custom
icons
compiled
into
the
program
dont
work
at
all
but
on
the
bw
terminal
it
works
fine
i
can
set
the
icon
to
an
xbm
file
with
twmrc
but
that
doesnt
give
the
neato
change
when
busy
action
other
programs
with
similar
actions
eg
xmail
xbiff
work
fine
the
xinterface
author
george
ferguson
suggests
it
might
be
a
problem
with
the
x
intrinsics
but
isnt
willing
to
hack
around
to
fix
it
himself
but
i
know
zero
about
x
programming
so
i
dont
think
i
can
find
it
does
anyone
out
there
know
an
obvious
fix
for
the
problem
