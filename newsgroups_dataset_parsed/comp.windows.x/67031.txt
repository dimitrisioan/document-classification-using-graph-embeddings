RE
MONTHLY
QUESTION
ABOUT
XCOPYAREA
AND
EXPOSE
EVENTS
POSTING
OF
THE
QUESTION
THAT
JUST
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
GET
ANSWERED
SUPPOSE
YOU
HAVE
AN
IDLE
APP
WITH
A
REALIZED
AND
MAPPED
WINDOW
THAT
CONTAINS
XLIB
GRAPHICS
A
BUTTON
WIDGET
WHEN
PRESSED
WILL
CAUSE
A
NEW
ITEM
TO
BE
DRAWN
IN
THE
WINDOW
THIS
ACTION
CLEARLY
SHOULD
NOT
CALL
XCOPYAREA
OR
EQUIV
DIRECTLY
INSTEAD
IT
SHOULD
REGISTER
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
NEW
ITEM
IN
A
MEMORY
STRUCTURE
AND
LET
THE
SAME
EXPOSE
EVENT
HANDLER
THAT
HANDLES
REGULAR
EXPOSE
EVENTS
EG
WINDOW
MANAGERDRIVEN
EXPOSURES
TAKE
CARE
OF
RENDERING
THE
NEW
IMAGE
USING
AN
EXPOSE
EVENT
HANDLER
IS
A
PROPER
WAY
TO
DO
THIS
BECAUSE
AT
THE
TIME
THE
HANDLER
IS
CALLED
THE
XLIB
WINDOW
IS
GUARANTEED
TO
BE
MAPPED
THE
PROBLEM
OF
COURSE
IS
THAT
NO
EXPOSE
EVENT
IS
GENERATED
IF
THE
WINDOW
IS
ALREADY
VISIBLE
AND
MAPPED
WHAT
WE
NEED
TO
DO
IS
SOMEHOW
TICKLE
THE
WINDOW
SO
THAT
THE
EXPOSE
HANDLER
IS
HIT
WITH
ARGUMENTS
THAT
WILL
ENABLE
IT
TO
RENDER
JUST
THE
PART
OF
THE
WINDOW
THAT
CONTAINS
THE
NEW
ITEM
WHAT
IS
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
TICKLE
A
WINDOW
TO
PRODUCE
THIS
BEHAVIOR
IF
I
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
PROBLEM
CORRECTLY
YOU
WANT
TO
HAVE
A
WAY
TO
SEND
EXPOSURES
TO
YOUR
MANAGER
WIDGET
WHEN
YOUR
APPSPECIFIC
CODE
DRAWS
XLIB
GRAPHICS
ON
THE
WINDOW
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
SEND
AN
EXPOSURE
USING
XSENDEVENT
AND
SPECIFYING
A
REGION
IF
YOU
KNOW
THE
REGION
YOU
NEED
TO
SEND
THE
EXPOSURE
GENERALLY
YOU
HAVE
THE
BOUNDING
RECTANGLE
OF
THE
OBJECTS
YOU
CAN
USE
XCREATEREGION
TO
CREATE
A
REGION
XUNIONRECTWITHREGION
TO
ADD
THE
NEW
OBJECT
POLYGONS
TO
THE
REGION
AND
THEN
EITHER
USE
THE
REGION
TO
CLIP
YOUR
GC
FOR
THE
REDRAW
OR
USE
XRECTINREGION
TO
TEST
WHICH
OF
YOUR
OTHER
OBJECTS
NEED
TO
BE
REDRAWN
KEEPING
IN
MIND
THAT
THE
STACKING
ORDER
OF
OVERLAPPING
OBJECTS
AFFECTS
HOW
THEY
LOOK
