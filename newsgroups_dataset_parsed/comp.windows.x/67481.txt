RUN
ON
STANDARD
MONOCHROME
X
WITH
A
SMALL
SCREEN
SIZE
NO
MOTIFOPENLOOK
ETC
IT
MUST
COMPILE
UNDER
LINUX
WITH
GCCG
MOST
GENERIC
UNIX
SOFTWARE
WORKS
OK
IT
MUST
PRODUCE
POSTSCRIPT
FILES
THAT
I
CAN
INCLUDE
INTO
LATEX
DOCUMENTS
WITH
DVIPS
OR
JUST
TELL
ME
ANOTHER
FREE
PROGRAM
THAT
CONVERTS
ONE
OF
THE
SUPPORTED
FORMATS
TO
PS
IT
MUST
PRODUCE
DRAWINGS
THAT
ARE
LARGER
THAN

SIZE
SCROLLABLE
I

A
TRANSISTOR

THREE
LINES
AN
ARROW
AND
A
CIRCLE
ANY
AID
NUMERIC
COORDINATES
SCREEN
GRID
TO
ALIGN
PARTS
OF
THE
DRAWING
LESS
ESSENTIAL
BUT
IN
FACT
VERY
HANDY
PRESERVATION
OF
CONNECTION
IF
I
MOVE
ONE
PART
OF
THE
DRAWING
THE
LINES
THAT
CONNECT
THAT
PART
TO
THE
REST
OF
THE

STAY
CONNECTED
IDEALLY

ARBITRARY
SCALING
OF
