interactive
performance
for
image
display
about
frames
per
second
seems
to
be
the
lower
limit
for
interactive
operations

just
bringing
up
an
image
for
viewing
less
than
second
seems
to
be
a
good
number
of
course
the
measure
of
response
time
should
be
based
on
the
applications
you
are
planning
to
run
