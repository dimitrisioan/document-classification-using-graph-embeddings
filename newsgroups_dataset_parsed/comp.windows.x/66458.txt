am
in
the
process
of
making
the
decision
whether
i
should
write
c
wrappers
for
motif
myself
or
use
motif
or
interviews
though
i
have
downloaded
the
tar
files
i
fail
to
see
any
documentation
i
have
two
questions
if
you
have
used
these
or
similar
csy
toolkits
what
has
been
your
experience
where
do
i
find
reference

them

and
