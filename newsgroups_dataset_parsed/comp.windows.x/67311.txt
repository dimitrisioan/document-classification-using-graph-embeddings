limited

hpux
version
either
with

without
the
pex
extension
the
sort
of
things
i
want
are
simple
drawing
resizing
and
moving
of
objects
such
as
lines
rectangles
and
text
bounding
rectangle
operations
are
sufficient
for
object
selection
ideally
it
should
also
allow
the
creation
and
placement
of
more
complex
objects
such
as
widgets
eg
text
entry
fields
or
labels
but
this

not
mandatory

anyone

such
an
animal

you
do
please

product
alternatively
