RE
ENCYCLOPEDIADIRECTORY
OF
WIDGETS
THE
ONLY
DIRECTORY
I
KNOW
OF
THAT
LISTS
COMMERCIAL
AND
NONCOMMERCIAL
WIDGETS
IS
THE
ICS
WIDGET
DATA
BOOK
ICS
SELLS
THE
WIDGETS
FOR
VARIOUS
PRICES
THERE
ARE
ALSO
SOME
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
WIDGETS
IN
THE
DELIVERY
THE
ICS
WIDGET
DATABOOK
IS
A
SUBSCRIPTION
KIND
OF
THING
WHERE
YOU
PAY
SOME
NOMINAL
FEE
GET
A
CD
WITH
THE
WIDGETS
AND
THEN
YOU
CAN
USE
THE
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
WIDGETS
FREELY
AND
SELECTIVELY
ACTIVATE
WIDGETS
WHICH
YOU
WANT
TO
PURCHASE
THE
RIGHT
TO
USE
FROM
THEM
THE
NICE
THING
ABOUT
THIS
IS
THAT
YOU
CAN
PURCHASE
WHOLE
SETS
OF
WIDGETS
SUCH
AS
THOSE
USED
IN
DATAVIEWS
I
DONT
KNOW
THERE
PRICING
SCHEMES
BUT
IT
IS
OFTEN
BETTER
TO
BUY
THAN
TO
REDEVELOP
THE
MORE
COMPLEX
WIDGETS
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
ONLY
ONE
CUSTOMER
TO
DISTRIBUTE
TO
THIS
IS
THE
EXTENT
THAT
I
KNOW
ABOUT
THEM
EXCEPT
THAT
I
GOT
THEIR
DATABOOK
CATALOG
AND
IT
LOOKED
IMPRESSIVE
LOTS
O
WIDGETS
THERE
I
DONT
WORK
FOR
ICS
OR
HAVE
ANY
WIDGETS
BEING
SOLD
BY
THEM
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
