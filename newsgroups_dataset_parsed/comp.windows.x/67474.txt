GUI
TOOLS
WE
ARE
MAKING
A
TRANSITION
FROM
NEXTSTEP
TO
XWINDOWS
I
AM
TRYING
TO
FIND
THE
BEST
GUI
TOOL
FOR
OUR
NEEDS
I
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
SEVERAL
TOOLS
BUT
THEY
ALL
SEEM
BASICALLY
THE
SAME
EACH
SALESMAN
WILL
BEG
TO
DIFFER
I
REALIZE
THAT
THERE
ARE
DIFFERENCES
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
AN
INFINATE
AMOUNT
OF
TIME
TO
DISCOVER
WHAT
THEY
ARE
THE
TOOLS
I
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
SO
FAR
ARE
UIMX
XDESIGNER
TELEUSE
TCLTKINTERVIEWS
AND
SUIT
SO
FAR
IVE
DRAWN
THE
FOLLOWING
CONCLUSIONS
THE
BUILDER
FOR
INTERVIEWS
IS
NOT
VERY
MATURE
BAD
DOCS
TELEUSE
IS
VERY
EXPENSIVE
AND
USES
A
PROPRIETARY
TOOLKIT
UIMX
XDESIGNER
SEEM
ABOUT
THE
SAME
EVEN
THOUGH
XDESIGNER
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
INTERPRETER
ILL
BY
CENTERLINE
IF
I
NEED
ONE
TCLTK
IS
A
LITTLE
BUGGY
I
KNOW
VERY
LITTLE
ABOUT
THE
ICS
BUILDER
JUST
HAVE
THE
SALES
INFO
DUE
TO
A
CORPORATE
AGREEMENT
XDESIGNER
IS
MUCH
CHEEPER
THAN
ANY
OTHER
COMERCIAL
PRODUCT
FOR
THE
TIME
IM
SPENDING
I
COULD
HAVE
BOUGHT
ALL
OF
THEM
WELL
DIFFERENT
MONEY
WE
WILL
HAVE
TO
LIVE
WITH
ANY
SHORTCOMINGS
AND
MAKE
IT
WORK
THIS
TYPE
OF
TOOL
SEEMS
GREAT
BUT
NOONE
SEEMS
TO
TALK
ABOUT
THEM
ON
THE
NET
IS
THERE
ANOTHER
NEWS
GROUP
FOR
THIS
SUIT
COST
TOO
MUCH
FOR
COMERCIAL
DEVELOPMENT
IM
HOPING
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
HAS
A
STRONG
OPINION
ON
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THESE
PRODUCTS
