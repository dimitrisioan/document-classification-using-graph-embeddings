how
to
access
color
on
we
have
a
sun
and
we
have
just
acquired
a
frame
buffer
card
the
is
supposed
to
support
both
a
color
visual
and
a
monochrome
visual
the
default
visual
for
the
xnews
server
is
the
monochrome
and
we
are
unable
to
change
it
to
the
visual
we
have
tried
using
xgetvisualinfo
to
get
a
visual
of
depth
but
had
no
success
xdpyinfo
gives
no
information
about
a
deep
visual
only
monochrome
there
are
two
possible
solutions
if
someone
has
patches
for
xsun
server
could
they
forward
them
to
us
otherwise
could
someone
instruct
us
how
to
access
the
color
in
openwindows
