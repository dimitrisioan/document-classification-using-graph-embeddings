am

making
a
reasonably
large

im
the
following
packages
meet
your
criteria
in
that
they
are
pd
and
present
an
aesthetically
pleasant
graphical
interface
to
the
users
if
you
can
use
there
is
openlook
there
is
interviews
which
looks
a
little
like
motif
there
is
gopath
a
very
nice
c
toolkit
for
athena
widgets
and
motif
which
is
simpler
and
better
than
interviews
and
you
will
enjoy
technical
support
from
bull
via
email
it
has
a
nice
draw
program
it
uses
motif
which
can
be
used
to
create
graphical
frontend
to
programs
the
data
format
is
called
streams
which
you
can
feed
to
your
programs
i
ported
gopath
on
an
internet
machine
which
is
gone
but
if
you
use
with
minimal
effort
gopath
can
be
ported
to
last
but
not
least
gopath
interfaces
to
toolkits
via
a
driver
module
they
have
an
mswindows
driver
module
for
instance
also
many
have
written
extensions
to
tktcl
thus
allowing
powerful
applications
for
instance
tclnm
has
snmp
extensions
for
tktcl
with
ease
i
can
now
combine
