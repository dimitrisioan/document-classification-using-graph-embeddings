efficient
pc
clients
were
looking
at
various
clients
for
pcs
and
were
looking
for
some
information
about
the
relative
efficiency
of
different
products
are
any
notably
efficient
fast
are
any
notably
inefficient
i
assume
that
a
graphics
accelerator
makes
them
significantly
faster
right
now
im
looking
at
ico
running
on
for
windows
sitting
on
the
distinct
tcpip
platform
and
its
not
surprisingly
much
slower
than
ico
running
on
the
console
what
are
the
key
ways
of
improving
performance
for
pc
presumably
windows
clients
also
what
about
async
solutions
yes
i
appreciate
that
it
will
be
much
slower
even
with
im
in
the
process
of
installing
ppp
with
header
compression
how
does
that
compare
to
cslip
ive
seen
a
product
called
xremote
by
ncd
that
promises
to
be
pretty
efficient
but
are
there
comparable
products
out
there
if
were
looking
for
efficiency
for
async
pc
clients
what
should
we
be
looking
at
in
addition
to
standard
ppp
w
compression
and
xremote
any
information
would
be
greatly
appreciated
im
still
taking
in
all
the
information
in
the
faq
but
any
tips
about
the
relative
efficiency
of
various
product
offerings
would
be
great
i
get
the
impression
that
discussions
about
speed
are
largely
application
specific
but
that
not
withstanding
any
comments
would
be
appreciated
thanks
