LOOKS
INTERESTING
BUT
I
NEED
SOMEONE
TO
POINT
ME
TO
SOME
DOCUMENTATION
IS
THIS
METHOD
LIKELY
TO
GIVE
BETTER
RESULTS
THAN
SERVER
RESIDENT
PIXMAPS
ID
ALSO
BE
INTERESTED
IN
LOOKING
AT
THE
XVIEW
CODE
MENTIONED
ABOVE
THERE
IS
NO
EASY
ANSWER
TO
THIS
QUESTION
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHETHER
THE
DISPLAY
DEVICE
CAN
HOLD
PIXMAPS
IN
OFFSCREEN
MEMORY
AND
IF
SO
HOW
EFFICIENTLY
THE
SERVER
MANAGES
THESE
RESOURCES
HAVING
TO
DEAL
WITH
LIMITED
OFFSCREEN
MEMORY
IS
THE
BANE
OF
THE
SERVER
IMPLEMENTORS
EXISTENCE
I
HAVE
WORKED
WITH
GRAPHICS
DEVICES
WHERE
THE
OFFSCREEN
MEMORY
TO
MAIN
DISPLAY
COPY
RATE
ECLIPSES
THAT
OF
THE
MAIN
MEMORY
TO
DISPLAY
COPY
RATE
AND
WITH
THOSE
WHERE
THE
MAIN
MEMORY
TO
DISPLAY
IS
FASTER
THAN
OFFSCREEN
TO
DISPLAY
REQUIRES
ONLY
A
WRITE
TO
THE
FRAMEBUFFER
RATHER
THAN
A
READ
OF
THE
FB
FOLLOWED
BY
A
WRITE
IF
YOUR
SERVER
USES
THE
CFB
CODE
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
IT
TO
RENDER
INTO
PIXMAPS
IN
CPU
MAIN
MEMORY
THE
RATES
YOU
CAN
GET
THROUGH
MITSHM
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
EQUAL
MAYBE
A
TAD
SLOWER
DEPENDING
ON
YOUR
OSS
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
SHARED
MEMORY
TO
COPYAREA
FROM
PIXMAP
TO
WINDOW
WHICH
IS
ALSO
THEN
JUST
A
COPY
FROM
CPU
MAIN
MEMORY
TO
GRAPHICS
DEVICE
ONE
ADVANAGE
OF
MITSHM
IS
THAT
IF
YOUR
IMAGES
ARE
LARGE
YOU
DONT
END
UP
GROWING
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
SERVER
PROCESS
TO
HOLD
THEM
ONE
DISADVANTAGE
OF
THE
MITSHM
IS
THAT
IN
ITS
SAMPLE
IMPLEMENTATION
THERE
IS
NO
PROVISION
FOR
ELEGANTLY
CLEANING
UP
THE
SHARED
MEMORY
SEGMENTS
IF
THE
CLIENT
DIES
A
SUDDEN
VIOLENT
DEATH
EG
KILL
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
