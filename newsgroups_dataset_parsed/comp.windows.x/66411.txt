RE
GADGETS
VS
WIDGETS
MOTIF
MANAGERS
TAKE
A
VERY
SIMPLISTIC
APPROACH
TO
THE
WAY
THEY
HANDLE
EVENTS
FOR
GADGETS
THEY
TRACK
FOR
ALL
EVENTSSUCH
AS
MOTION
NOTIFY
WETHER
OR
NOT
THE
GADGET
EXPRESSES
INTEREST
IN
THE
EVENTS
AS
A
RESULT
GADGETS
TYPICALLY
GENERATE
A
GREAT
DEAL
MORE
NETWORK
TRAFFIC
THOSE
WITH
X
TERMINALS
MIGHT
FIND
A
NOTICABLE
NETWORK
PERFORMANCE
DROP
AS
A
RESULT
REALLY
WHATS
THE
POINT
USING
GADGETS
THEN
IT
IS
A
CASE
OF
MEMORY
VS
NETWORK
PERFORMANCE
TRADEOFF
GADGETS
SAVE
BOTH
CLIENT
AND
SERVER
MEMORY
BUT
MEMORY
IS
EASILY
EXPANDABLE
WHILE
NETWORK
PERFORMANCE
IS
NOT
SO
IF
I
WERE
DESIGNING
MOTIF
I
WOULD
AT
LEAST
MAKE
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
AVOID
USING
GADGETS
AT
PRESENT
YOU
REALLY
DONT
HAVE
A
CHOICE
BECAUSE
MOTIF
FORCES
YOU
TO
USE
GADGETS
IN
MENUS
AND
IN
VARIOUS
OTHER
PLACES
ADRIAN
NYE
OREILLY
AND
ASSOCIATES
INC
IVE
BEEN
USING
THE
XMGRAPH
WIDGET
THATS
BEEN
FLOATING
AROUND
AND
I
NOTICED
THE
PERFORMANCE
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
BETTER
USING
GADGETS
PERHAPS
EVEN
FASTER
I
HAD
HEARD
IN
AN
OLD
PROGRAMMING
COURSE
THAT
GADGETS
WERE
NO
LONGER
ANY
BENEFIT
TO
PERFORMANCE
AND
THAT
ITS
JUST
AS
WELL
TO
USE
WIDGETS
EVERYWHERE
SO
WHY
WOULD
PUSHBUTTON
GADGETS
BE
A
LOT
QUICKER
THAN
PUSHBUTTONS
IN
THE
GRAPH
SHOULD
I
START
PUTTING
GADGETS
BACK
INTO
MY
LONG
PULLDOWN
