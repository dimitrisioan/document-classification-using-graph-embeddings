tooltalklike
message
server

at
it
since
the
sunsupplied
textedit
binary
doesnt
seem
to
speak
tooltalk
however
the
sources
in
the
contrib
area
seem
to
be
for
an
older
version
of
textedit
than
the
version
shipped
with
openwindows
for
example
the
own
textedit
includes
drag
and
drop
support
and
a
dropsite
in
the
main
control
area
while
the
source
in
contribxview
knows
nothing
about
drag
and
drop
the
texteditc
included
in
the
xview
sources
says
its
version
dated
while
doing
a
what
textedit
on
the
own
binary
says
texteditc
