SOME
DELETED
IF
YOU
LOOK
CLOSELY
AT
MOTIF
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
IT
IS
JUST
MSWINDOWS
WITH
MORE
EYEPLEASING
COLOR
AND
TEXTURE
THE
ONLY
REAL
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
AN
MS
APPLICATION
WINDOW
CAN
CONTAIN
OTHER
TOPLEVEL
CHILDREN
WHILE
A
MOTIF
APPLICATION
WINDOW
LAUNCHES
ITS
CHILDREN
OUT
ONTO
THE
DESKTOP
AAB
TO
THOSE
OF
YOU
FAMILIAR
WITH
BOTH
GUIS
IS
THIS
CORRECT
MY
EXPERIENCE
AAB
WITH
X
MAKES
ME
THINK
THAT
THIS
MSW
BEHAVIOR
IS
EASILY
DUPLICATED
AAB
WITH
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
MSW
ANOTHER
IMPORTANT
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
MSW
DOESNT
HAVE
ANY
WINDOW
THAT
HANDLE
SOPHISTICATED
GEOMETRY
MANAGEMENT
LIKE
XMFORM
ALSO
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IN
WINDOWS
YOURE
LIMITED
TO
OF
RESOURCES
WINDOWS
MENUS
ICONS
ETC
IMHO
THIS
WHOLE
DISCUSSION
NAMED
MOTIF
LOOKS
LIKE
MSWINDOGS
IS
TOTALLY
STUPID
THE
ONLY
THING
REMOTELY
INFLUENCED
HERE
CAN
BE
THE
MOTIF
WINDOW
MANAGER
THAT
FEATURES
AN
ARRANGEMENT
OF
BUTTONS
AND
MENUS
SOMEWHAT
SIMILIAR
TO
THIS
OF
THE
MSW
WINDOWMANAGING
AGENT
HOWEVER
ITS
NAME
IS
BUT
MWM
IS
ONLY
A
SMALL
PART
OF
MOTIF
IN
FACT
MWM
AND
MOTIF
CAN
WORK
WITHOUT
EACH
OTHER
AND
IF
ONE
DOESNT
LIKE
MWMS
OUTFIT
FOR
SOME
REASON
HE
SWITCHES
TO
ANOTHER
WINDOWMANAGER
ALL
THIS
DOESNT
INFLUENCE
MOTIF
WHICH
IS
A
TOOLKIT
OF
WIDGETS
TO
WRITE
APPLICATIONS
AND
THIS
TOOLKIT
IS
IMHO
UNCOMPARABLE
TO
MSW
BECAUSE
IT
IS
MUCH
MORE
WELLORGANIZED
AND
FEATURES
ALOT
OF
GOODIES
MORE
THAN
THE
MSW
INTERFACE
YOU
CANNOT
SAY
A
PORSCHE
LOOKS
LIKE
A
VW
KÄFER
ONLY
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
THE
WHEEL
AND
THE
GEAR
AT
THE
SAME
POSITION
MOTIF
AND
MSW
ARE
COMPLETE
DIFFERENT
WORLDS
ONLY
ONE
ELEMENT
OF
THE
MOTIF
WORLD
HAS
SOME
GEAR
AND
WHEEL
AT
THE
SAME
POSITION
AS
MSW
