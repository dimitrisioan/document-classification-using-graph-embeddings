ive
seen
a
lot
of
different
terms
which
seem
to
mean
the
same
thing
who
can
give
an
exact
definition
what
these
terms
mean
multiscreen
multiheaded
multidisplay
xserver
zaphod
mode
as
applied
to
servers
the
first
three
are
fuzzy
terms
multiheaded
tends
to
be
used
for
any
system
with
multiple
monitors
sometimes
even
multiple
screens
even
if
theyre
multiplexed
onto
the
same
monitor
eg
a
sun
with
a
display
multiscreen
and
multidisplay
would
if
taken
strictly
mean
different
things
but
since
the
strict
meaning
of
multidisplay
would
refer
to
a
system
with
multiple
keyboards
and
pointers
when
its
used
it
probably
refers
to
the
same
thing
multiscreen
would
a
system
that
provides
multiple
screens
zaphod
is
a
term
applied
to
the
way
the
mit
server
switches
the
pointer
from
one
screen
to
another
by
sliding
it
off
the
side
of
the
screen
is
there
a
limit
how
many
screensdisplays
a
single
server
can
handle
in
an
articel
a
read
something
about
an
upper
limit
of
there
is
a
protocol
limitation
that
restricts
a
given
display
to
at
most
screens
i
know
of
no
server
that
handles
multiple
displays
on
a
single
invocation
unless
possibly
my
kludges
to
the
server
can
be
looked
upon
as
such
on
a
tcpbased
system
there
is
necessarily
a
limit
of
displays
per
machine
but
this
is
not
a
limitation
inherent
to
x
what
you
read
was
most
likely
talking
about
a
limit
in
some
particular
implementation
probably
the
mit
one
if
it
claimed
there
was
a
limit
of
inherent
to
