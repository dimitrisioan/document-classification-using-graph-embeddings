A

WHAT

THE

SOMETIMES
EVEN

EVEN
IF
THEYRE

ONTO
THE

EG
A
SUN
WITH
A

MULTISCREEN
AND
MULTIDISPLAY
WOULD
IF
TAKEN
STRICTLY
MEAN
DIFFERENT
THINGS
BUT
SINCE
THE
STRICT
MEANING
OF
MULTIDISPLAY
WOULD
REFER
TO
A
SYSTEM
WITH
MULTIPLE
KEYBOARDS
AND
POINTERS
WHEN
ITS
USED
IT
PROBABLY
REFERS
TO
THE

THING
MULTISCREEN
WOULD
A
SYSTEM
THAT
PROVIDES
MULTIPLE

ZAPHOD
IS
A

I

THAT

UNLESS
POSSIBLY

CAN
BE
LOOKED
UPON
AS
SUCH

THERE
IS
