DETECTING
READONLY
COLORCELLS
AGAIN
POSETED
FOR
A
FRIEND
OKAY
I
GOT
SUCH
GREAT
RESPONSE
FROM
MY
LAST
QUESTION
THANKS
EVERYONE
LETS
TRY
AGAIN
HOW
CAN
I
TELL
IF
A
COLORCELL
IS
READONLY
I
WANT
TO
USE
ANY
READONLY
CELLS
THAT
ARE
ALREADY
IN
MY
COLORMAP
ONCE
I
START
RUNNING
OUT
OF
ALLOCATABLE
CELLS
USING
SOME
ARBITRARY
NEAREST
COLOR
MATCHING
SCHEME
TO
GET
THOSE
CELLS
THAT
COME
CLOSEST
TO
A
REQUESTED
COLOR
ONCE
I
DETERMINE
IF
A
CELL
IS
READONLY
I
ASSUME
I
CAN
THEN
JUST
REQUEST
AN
XALLOCCOLOR
WITH
THE
EXACT
SAME
COLOR
SPECIFICATIONS
AND
IT
WILL
THEN
BE
FLAGGED
AS
USED
BY
MY
APPLICATION
SO
THAT
IT
DOESNT
LATER
GET
FREED
BY
SOMEONE
ELSE
AND
ALLOCATED
AGAIN
AS
READWRITE
TO
ANOTHER
APPLICATION
SO
FAR
THE
ONLY
WAY
IVE
FIGURED
OUT
TO
DO
THIS
IS
TO
WRITE
MY
OWN
ERROR
HANDLER
AND
JUST
GO
AHEAD
AND
REQUEST
THE
CELLS
COLORS
ONCE
MY
COLORMAP
IS
ALL
FULL
UP
IT
SHOULD
ERROR
OUT
IF
THE
CELL
IS
NONSHAREABLE
BUT
LIFE
WOULD
BE
MUCH
EASIER
IF
I
COULD
JUST
DETECT
THE
READONLYSHAREABLE
STUFF
DIRECTLY
ANY
IDEAS
