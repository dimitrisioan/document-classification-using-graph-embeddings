WRITES
DEAR
XPERTS
HERES
MY
PROBLEM
I
AM
DESIGNING
SEVERAL
RELATED
X
APPLICATIONS
EACH
ONE
IS
A
SEPARATE
EXECUTABLE
AND
ID
LIKE
TO
BUILD
A
SINGLE
CONTROL
WINDOW
THAT
WOULD
ALLOW
THE
USER
TO
ACCESS
EACH
APPLICATION
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
TO
LOCATE
THE
CORRECT
ICON
THE
CONTROL
WINDOW
WOULD
CONTAIN
A
BUTTON
FOR
EACH
APPLICATION
AND
BY
PRESSING
IT
THE
APPLICATIONS
MAIN
WINDOW
WOULD
APPEAR
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
USE
THE
APPLICATIONS
BUTTON
AS
A
COLOR
STATUS
INDICATOR
HAS
ANYONE
DONE
THIS
OR
HAVE
ANY
GOOD
IDEAS
BECAUSE
THESE
ARE
ALL
SEPARATE
EXECUTABLES
THIS
SEEMS
LIKE
A
COMMUNICATIONS
NIGHTMARE
TO
ME
BUT
MAYBE
IM
WRONG
ID
APPRECIATE
ANY
IDEAS
IM
USING
AND
MOTIF
THANKS
DBOHDALJAGUARESSHARRISCOM
I
CAN
THINK
OF
TWO
DIFFERENT
METHODS
THAT
YOU
COULD
TRY
USE
FORK
AND
EXECV
USE
THE
SYSTEM
CALLED
IN
YOUR
PROGRAM
IM
ASSUMING
THAT
YOURE
RUNNING
UNDER
THE
UNIX
