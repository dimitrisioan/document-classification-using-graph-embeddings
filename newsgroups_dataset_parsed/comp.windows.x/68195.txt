re
cmotif
gcc
silly
messages
thanks
to
everyone
who
mailed
help
unfortunately
the
end
problem
was
a
really
stupid
oversight
on
my
behalf
the
code
was
perfect
but
it
might
help
to
add
controlc
to
my
makefile
anyway
the
mangled
name
was
telling
me
it
couldnt
locate
the
control
constructor
i
just
want
to
reaffirm
what
a
valuable
book
this
one
is
im
enjoying
evry
page
