XWD
SEGMENTATION
FAULT
I
WAS
PLANNING
TO
USE
THE
FOLLOWING
PIPE
TO
MOVE
SOME
DISPLAY
DATA
TO
A
SYSTEM
THAT
HAS
A
COLOR
HARDCOPY
UNIT
XWD
XWUD
DISPLAY
I
HAD
TESTED
IT
WITH
SOME
SIMPLE
WINDOWS
LIKE
THE
OPENWINDOWS
FILE
MANAGER
AND
IT
WORKED
FINE
BUT
WHEN
I
TRIED
IT
WITH
A
MORE
COMPLEX
LARGER
IMAGE
THE
XWD
PART
BLEW
UP
WITH
A
SEGMENTATION
FAULT
I
TRIED
IT
WITHOUT
THE
PIPE
BY
REDIRECTING
XWDS
OUTPUT
TO
A
FILE
AND
THEN
USED
THE
FILE
AS
INPUT
TO
XWUD
AND
GOT
THE
SAME
ERROR
FROM
XWUD
IF
I
HAD
TO
GUESS
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
ITS
RUNNING
OUT
OF
MEMORY
BUT
THIS
HAPPENED
ON
A
SPARC
WITH
MEGS
MEG
SWAP
SPACE
AND
ONLY
ONE
USER
WITH
MINIMAL
ACTIVITY
THE
FILE
WAS
ABOUT
MB
THIS
VERION
OF
XWDXWUD
WAS
SUPPLIED
WITH
THE
SUN
OPENWINDOWS
DISTRIBUTION
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
CORRESPONDS
TO
ANY
IDEAS
