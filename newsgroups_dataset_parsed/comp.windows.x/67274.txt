xwd
segmentation
fault
i
was
planning
to
use
the
following
pipe
to
move
some
display
data
to
a
system
that
has
a
color
hardcopy
unit
xwd
xwud
display
i
had
tested
it
with
some
simple
windows
like
the
openwindows
file
manager
and
it
worked
fine
but
when
i
tried
it
with
a
more
complex
larger
image
the
xwd
part
blew
up
with
a
segmentation
fault
i
tried
it
without
the
pipe
by
redirecting
xwds
output
to
a
file
and
then
used
the
file
as
input
to
xwud
and
got
the
same
error
from
xwud
if
i
had
to
guess
it
seems
like
its
running
out
of
memory
but
this
happened
on
a
sparc
with
megs
meg
swap
space
and
only
one
user
with
minimal
activity
the
file
was
about
mb
this
verion
of
xwdxwud
was
supplied
with
the
sun
openwindows
distribution
which
i
believe
corresponds
to
any
ideas
thanks
in
advance
