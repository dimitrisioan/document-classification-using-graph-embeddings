XDM
DECNET
DOES
XDM
WORK
WITH
DECNET
I
HAVE
AN
ULTRIX
MACHINE
RUNNING
BOTH
TCPIP
AND
DECNET
I
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
XTERMINALS
HANGING
OFF
THE
ULTRIX
HOST
ALSO
RUNNING
TCPIP
AND
DECNET
PRESENTLY
I
AM
USING
XDM
FOR
THE
LOGIN
PROCEDURE
ON
THE
XTERMINALS
USING
TCPIP
SINCE
XDM
IS
BASICALLY
JUST
AN
XWINDOWS
CLIENT
SHOULDNT
I
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
XDM
ON
THE
DECNET
PROTOCOL
TOWER
AS
WELL
MY
FIRST
INCLINATION
IS
THAT
XDM
IS
NOT
YOUR
TYPICAL
X
CLIENT
IT
IS
MAKING
TCPIP
SPECIFIC
SOCKET
CALLS
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
ANSWER
WOULD
BE
NO
YOU
CAN
NOT
RUN
XDM
OVER
DECNET
IS
THIS
RIGHT
OR
NOT
ANY
FEEDBACK
IS
APPRECIATED
THANKS
