JEFFREY
C
GEALOW
WRITES
IM
WORKING
ON
AN
APPLICATION
AND
HAVE
CONCERNS
REGARDING
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
THE
DOCUMENTATION
SAYS
USUALLY
A
WINDOW
MANAGER
CREATES
THESE
COLORMAPS
I
WONDER
WHAT
WINDOW
MANAGER
THE
WRITER
HAD
IN
MIND
NEITHER
TWM
OR
MWM
SEEM
TO
CREATE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
WERE
SPECD
WITH
THE
INTENTION
THAT
WINDOW
MANAGERS
WOULD
MAKE
THEM
AVAILABLE
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
THAT
EVERY
WINDOW
MANAGER
AUTHOR
IN
THE
WORLD
IMMEDIATELY
DROPPED
EVERYTHING
THEY
WERE
DOING
AND
IMPLEMENTED
THIS
AT
TOP
PRIORITY
THE
ESGE
SERVER
WE
SHIP
MAKES
THE
XARGBBESTMAP
AVAILABLE
AT
STARTUP
IT
DOESNT
WAIT
FOR
WINDOW
MANAGERS
TO
DO
IT
OF
COURSE
ONE
CAN
USE
XSTDCMAP
TO
CREATE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
HOWEVER
XSTDCMAP
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
TRY
VERY
HARD
TO
AVOID
CONFLICTS
WITH
THE
DEFAULT
COLORMAP
WHEN
I
USE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
CREATED
BY
XSTDCMAP
THE
REST
OF
MY
DISPLAY
GOES
BLACK
SO
IT
SEEMS
AS
IF
USE
OF
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
CAUSES
THE
VERY
PROBLEM
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
ARE
INTENDED
TO
AVOID
PERHAPS
IF
EVERY
APPLICATION
USED
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
THINGS
WOULD
BE
WONDERFUL
BUT
NOT
MANY
APPLICATIONS
SEEM
TO
USE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
DOES
YOUR
HARDWARE
HAVE
ONLY
ONE
CLUT
SINCE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
TYPICALLY
DEVOUR
ALL
ENTRIES
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
IT
CAN
AVOID
DISPLACING
THE
ENTIRE
DEFAULT
COLORMAP
IF
YOUR
HARDWARE
HAS
ONLY
ONE
CLUT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
ARE
INTENDED
TO
ABOID
POSSIBLE
COLORMAP
FLASHING
BETWEEN
CLIENTS
USING
THE
DEFAULT
COILORMAP
RATHER
COLORMAP
FLASHING
WILL
BE
AVOIDED
BETWEEN
TWO
CLIENTS
THAT
USE
THE
SAME
STANDARD
COLORMAP
AN
EXAMPLE
WOULD
BE
TWO
CLIENTS
THAT
NEED
A
FULL
COLOR
RANGE
WOULD
BOTH
USE
XARGBBESTMAP
OR
WHATEVER
ITS
CALLED
UNDER
IF
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
AVOID
COLORMAP
FLASHING
WITH
THE
DEFAULT
COLORMAP
YOUR
BEST
BET
IS
TO
TRY
TO
LOAD
ALL
THE
COLORS
YOU
USE
INTO
THAT
COLORMAP
IF
YOU
CANT
DO
THAT
THEN
YOULL
GET
FLASHING
ON
A
ONE
HW
CLUT
FRAMEBUFFER
NOW
IF
YOUR
WINDOW
MANAGER
USED
THE
SAME
STANDARD
COLORMAP
AS
YOUR
CLIENT
THIS
FLASHING
COULD
ALSO
BE
AVOIDED
PERHAPS
SOME
WINDOW
MANAGERS
HAVE
COMMAND
LINE
OPTIONS
FOR
SELECTING
STANDARD
COLORMAPS
