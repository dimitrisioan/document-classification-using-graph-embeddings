OPINIONS
ON
GALAXY
WE
ARE
CURRENTLY
EVALUATING
GUI
BUILDERS
INITIALLY
FOR
MOTIF
BUT
WITH
A
WISH
TO
BE
FLEXIBLE
PORTABLE
WE
HAVE
BEEN
THROUGH
THE
POPULAR
NAMES
UIMX
TELEUSE
XVT
ETC
AND
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
IMPRESSED
WITH
WHAT
WE
HAVE
SEEN
OF
GALAXY
FROM
VISIX
I
HAVE
SPOKEN
TO
CURRENT
USERS
FROM
A
LIST
SUPPLIED
BY
VISIX
HAPPY
USERS
AS
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
AND
SEEN
FAVOURABLE
COMMENTS
ON
THE
NET
HOWEVER
SINCE
IT
IS
FAIRLY
EXPENSIVE
TO
GET
AN
EVALUATION
LICENSE
FROM
VISIX
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
QUERY
THE
NET
FOR
ANY
NEGATIVE
EXPERIENCES
WITH
GALAXY
DID
ANYBODY
EVALUATE
THEM
AND
PREFER
ANOTHER
TOOL
OR
USE
GALAXY
AND
REGRET
IT
OR
FIND
ANY
MISFEATURES
