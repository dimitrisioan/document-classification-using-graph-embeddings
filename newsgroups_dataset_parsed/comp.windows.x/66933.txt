opinions
on
galaxy
we
are
currently
evaluating
gui
builders
initially
for
motif
but
with
a
wish
to
be
flexible
portable
we
have
been
through
the
popular
names
uimx
teleuse
xvt
etc
and
have
been
very
impressed
with
what
we
have
seen
of
galaxy
from
visix
i
have
spoken
to
current
users
from
a
list
supplied
by
visix
happy
users
as
you
would
expect
and
seen
favourable
comments
on
the
net
however
since
it
is
fairly
expensive
to
get
an
evaluation
license
from
visix
i
would
like
to
query
the
net
for
any
negative
experiences
with
galaxy
did
anybody
evaluate
them
and
prefer
another
tool
or
use
galaxy
and
regret
it
or
find
any
misfeatures
