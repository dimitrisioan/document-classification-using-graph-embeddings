how
do
i
change
the
text
cursor
in
xterm
i
have
just
finished
building
on
a
running
interactive
unix
and
i
am
having
a
problem
with
xterm
on
any
font
larger
that
it
messes
up
characters
that
are
types
the
cursor
seems
to
be
too
large
or
splits
into
a
reverse
video
outline
block
which
changes
when
the
pointer
is
moved
into
the
window
i
am
trying
to
use
monospaced
fonts
not
p
fonts
is
there
any
way
of
changing
the
appearence
of
the
block
cursor
