HOW
TO
MAKE
SIMPLEST
POSSIBLE
COMPOSITE
WIDGET
NOT
BEING
AN
XT
PROGRAMMER
BY
ANY
STRETCH
OF
THE
IMAGINATION
THIS
IS
DRIVING
ME
CRAZY
AND
ITS
PROBABLY
REALLY
SIMPLE
TO
DO
I
NEED
TO
MAKE
A
COMPOSITE
WIDGET
THAT
DOES
NOTHING
AT
ALL
BUT
IS
MERELY
A
PLACEHOLDER
IN
A
WIDGET
INSTANCE
HEIRARCHY
ALLOWING
ME
AN
ADDITIONAL
RESOURCE
NAME
LEVEL
TO
ILLUSTRATE
I
HAVE
AN
APPLICATION
WITH
THE
FOLLOWING
WIDGET
HEIRARCHY
SHELL
WIDGET
APPLICATION
WIDGHET
I
WANT
THE
FOLLOWING
SHELL
WIDGET
INTERMEDIATE
WIDGET
APPLICATION
WIDGET
WHERE
THE
INTERMEDIATE
WIDGET
HAS
A
NAME
BUT
GETS
ALL
ITS
OTHER
PROPERTIES
AND
PROPAGATES
DOWN
NEW
VALUES
FROM
THE
SHELL
WIDGET
I
ASSUME
THERES
A
SIMPLE
WAY
TO
DO
THIS
BUT
I
CANT
FIND
AN
EXAMPLE
AND
THE
DOCUMENTATION
I
HAVE
IS
RATHER
VAGUE
ABOUT
IMPLEMENTING
COMPOSITE
WIDGETS
PLEASE
RESPOND
VIA
EMAIL
ANY
HELP
WILL
BE
VERY
MUCH
APPRECIATED
