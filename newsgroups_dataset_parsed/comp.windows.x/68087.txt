HELP
I
AM
JUST
BEGINNING
TO
TRY
USING
THE
ATHENA
TOOLKIT
AND
AM
HAVING
SOME
PROBLEMS
GETTING
STARTED
I
THINK
THAT
SOME
FILES
ARE
MISSING
ON
THE
SYSTEM
BUT
THERE
IS
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THEY
ARE
JUST
IN
A
DIFFERENT
DIRECTORY
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
LINK
MY
PROGRAM
IT
CANT
FIND
XTINITAILIZE
XTREALIZEWIDGET
XTMAINLOOP
XTCREATEMANAGEDWIDGET
OR
COMMANDWIDGETCLASS
IVE
INCLUDED
INTRINSICH
AND
COMMANDH
I
ALSO
HAD
A
PROBLEM
ON
COMPILE
WITH
XTNCALLBACK
BUT
REPLACED
THAT
WITH
A
NULL
IN
ORDER
TO
COMPILE
AND
SEE
IF
THERE
WERE
ANY
OTHER
PROBLEMS
I
HAVENT
USED
A
TOOLKIT
BEFORE
AND
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
AN
EXAMPLE
I
GOT
FROM
THE
MANUEL
CAN
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
WHERE
I
MIGHT
LOOK
FOR
THESE
CALLS
THAT
IS
IN
WHAT
FILE
NOT
WHAT
DIRECTORY
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
UNDER
BECAUSE
THE
SYSTEM
MANAGER
DOESNT
BELIEVE
IN
STANDARD
DIRECTORIES
AND
GENERALLY
DOES
THINGS
HIS
OWN
WAY
I
AM
USING
UNIX
THANK
YOU
FOR
YOUR
ASSISTANCE
