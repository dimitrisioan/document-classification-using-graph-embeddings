KEYBOARD
MAPPING
AND
WINDOW
PLACEMENT
QUESTIONS
THESE
ARE
TWO
COMMON
SUBJECTS
SO
I
HOPE
SOMEONE
HAS
HAD
TO
DEAL
WITH
THESE
SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS
IF
MY
APPLICATION
DEPENDS
ON
MODIFIERS
WHAT
IS
THE
BEST
LOOKUP
METHOD
MY
CHOICES
ARE
TO
CALL
XGETMODIFIERMAPPING
FOR
EACH
KEY
PRESS
WITH
A
MODIFIER
OR
MAKE
THE
CALL
ONCE
AT
THE
INIT
OF
THE
APP
AND
STORE
THE
MODIFIERS
IN
A
LOOKUP
TABLE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DO
IT
THE
SECOND
WAY
BUT
I
CANT
SEEM
TO
GET
THE
NOTIFY
WHEN
THE
USER
USES
XMODMAP
TO
REMAP
THE
MODIFIERS
I
KNOW
THAT
WHEN
AN
APP
CALLS
XSETMODIFIERMAPPING
A
MAPPINGNOTIFY
EVENT
IS
GENERATED
NONMASKABLE
WHICH
I
CAN
PICK
UP
AND
MODIFY
MY
INTERNAL
TABLE
BUT
I
DONT
SEEM
TO
GET
ANY
NOTIFY
EVENTS
WHEN
THE
USER
USES
XMODMAP

I
USE

THIS
ALL
STEMS
FROM
PROBLEMS
WITH
USERS
OF
THE
SUN
KEYBOARD
AND
THE

PLUS
VARIOUS
ALTMETAETC
MODIFIER
REQUIREMENTS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
PLACE
A
POPUP
SO
THAT
IT
WILL
BE
TO
THE
IMMEDIATE
RIGHT
OF
MY
MAIN
WINDOW
I
WANT
IT
AT
THE
SAME
Y
COORD
AND
THEIR
RIGHTLEFT
SIDES
TOUCHING
WHAT
I
NEED
TO
ASK
FOR
IS
THE
XY
COORD
OF
THE
WINDOW
MANAGERS
BORDER
FOR
THE
MAIN
WINDOW
THIS
SHOULD
RING
A
BELL
WITH
ANYONE
WHO
HAS
CALLED
XTMOVEWIDGET
IMMEDIATELY
CHECKING
THE
XY
AFTER
THE
MOVE
AND
SEEING
THAT
IT
IS
RIGHT
AND
IN
THEIR
NEXT
CALLBACK
ASKING
FOR
THE
