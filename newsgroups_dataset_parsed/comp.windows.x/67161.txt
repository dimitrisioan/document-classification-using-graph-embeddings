QUESTION
REGARDING
OVERLAYING
OF
GRAPHICS
HELLO
I
WONDER
IF
SOME
ONE
CAN
SUGGEST
AN
ANSWER
TO
THE
FOLLOWING
QUESTION
I
AM
A
TOTAL
X
NOVICE
AND
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
YOU
MAY
HAVE
I
AM
TRYING
TO
CREATE
A
SIMPLE
DRAWING
TOOL
LETS
SAY
I
HAVE
TWO
RECTANGLES
ON
THE
CANVASSEE
ABOVE
ONE
INTERSECTING
THE
OTHER
NOW
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
DELETE
ONE
OF
THE
RECTANGLES
THE
WAY
I
DO
IT
IS
TO
CREATE
ANOTHER
GC
WHEREIN
I
USE
THE
GXXOR
LOGICAL
FUNCTION
AND
SIMPLY
REDRAW
THE
RECTANGLE
USING
THE
NEWLY
CREATED
GRAPHICS
CONTEXT
THUS
DELETING
IT
FOR
ALL
APPARENT
PURPOSES
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
APPROACH
IS
THAT
AT
THE
POINTS
OF
INTERSECTION
THE
PIXEL
LOCATIONS
BELONGING
TO
THE
OTHER
RECTANGLE
ALSO
BECOME
WHITE
WHICH
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
SHOULD
BE
AVOIDED
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
I
CAN
AVOID
THIS
PROBLEM
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
REDRAW
THE
OTHER
RECTANGLE
TOO
I
ALSO
WOULD
NOT
LIKE
TO
GENERATE
AN
EXPOSE
EVENT
FOR
THE
AFFECTED
AREA
AS
THIS
DEGRADES
PERFORMANCE
VERY
BADLY
THANK
YOU
GOPAL
