HI
IM
NEW
TO

GROUP
SO
PLEASE
BEAR
WITH
ME
TWO
YEARS
AGO
I
WROTE
A
SUNVIEW
APPLICATION
FOR
FAST
ANIMATION
OF
RASTER
FILES
WITH
SUNVIEW
BECOMING
RAPIDLY
OBSELETE
IVE
FINALLY
DECIDED
TO
REWRITE
EVERYTHING
FROM
SCRATCH
IN
XVIEW
I
PUT
TOGETHER
A
QUICK
TEST
AND
IVE
FOUND
THAT
XPUTIMAGE
IS
CONSIDERABLY
SLOWER
FACTOR
OF
ON
AVERAGE
THAN
THE
SUNVIEW
COMMAND
PWROP
WHICH
MOVES
IMAGE
DATA
FROM
MEMORY
PIXRECTS
TO
A
CANVAS
THIS
WAS
ON
A
SPARC
IPX
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
X
PROTOCOL
COMMUNICATION
IS
SLOWING
THINGS
DOWN
OR
XPUTIMAGE
IS
INEFFICIENTOR
BOTH
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
FASTEST
WAY
IN
TO
DUMP
PLANE
IMAGE
DATA
TO
A
WINDOW
CAN
I
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CLIENT
IS
RUNNING
ON
THE
SAME
MACHINE
AS
THE
SERVER
OR
AM
I
STUCK
WITH
XPUTIMAGE
IN
WHICH
CASE
I
MIGHT
AS
WELL
GIVE

NOW
