FASTER
THE
FIRST
TIME
IF

WERE
ABLE
TO
PREVENT
THIS
BEHAVIOUR

TWO
METHODS

RATHER
THAN
OLWM
KEEPING
OLWM
BUT
PUTTING
WMTIMEOUT
IN
THE

DIFFICUTY
WAS
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
POSITIONING

THANKS
SHIRLEY
I
RAN
IN
TO
THIS
PROBLEM
I
WHILE
AGO
AND
FROM
WHAT
I
REMEMBER
YOU
SHOULD
USE
XTTRANSLATECOORDINATES
ETC
AFTER
REALIZING
THE
MAIN
WIDGET
TO
CALCULATE
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
POPUP
THEN
USE
SOMETHING
LIKE
XTVASETVALUES
ON
THE
POPUP
WIDGETS
BEFORE
EVER
USING
THEM
CALLING
SETVALUES
REPEATEDLY
EG
EVERY
TIME
SOMETHING
POPS
UP
SEEMS
TO
BE
WHAT
SLOWS
YOU
DOWN
I
NEVER
DELVED
DEEP
ENOUGH
TO
FIGURE
OUT
EXACTLY
WHY
