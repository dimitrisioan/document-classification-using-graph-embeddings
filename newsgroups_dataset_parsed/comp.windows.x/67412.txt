cannot
create
plane
window
hello
xers
i
have
a
problem
i
am
not
able
to
create
a
window
with
bit
planes
the
following
code
illustrates
the
problem
include
stdioh

i
tried
this
with
an
sgi
with
plane
truecolor
server
and
with
an
hp
plane
directcolor
server
with
the
obviously
neccessary
change
both
running
on
the
client
side
i
have
tried
with
xlib
on
hp
and
decstation
and
with
xlib
on
decstation
all
the
combinations
gave
badmatch
error
on
the
createwindow
request
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
manual
the
only
attribute
which
may
give
a
badmatch
is
the
colormap
if
it
belongs
to
a
wrong
visual
but
the
visual
was
correctly
matched
as
i
did
not
get
the
error
message
what
am
i
doing
wrong
for
information
i
can
tell
that
xwud
aborts
with
the
same
error
