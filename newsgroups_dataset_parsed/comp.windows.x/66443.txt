problem
with
tek
xterminal
we
have
recently
purchased
a
tektronix
xterminal
and
im
having
a
problem
with
it
we
have
a
graphics
widget
that
we
wrote
to
display
waveforms
and
it
doesnt
work
on
the
xterminal
the
buttons
etc
all
show
up
and
it
seems
to
take
the
right
amount
of
time
to
draw
but
nothing
is
visible
in
the
graphics
window
i
have
no
clue
as
to
where
to
start
looking
the
program
works
fine
on
all
our
suns
and
color
and
bw
could
anyone
suggest
a
line
of
attack
for
this
problem
