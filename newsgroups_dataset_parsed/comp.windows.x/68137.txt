i
tried
to
start
a
discussion
in
compwindowsx
at
the
start
of
the
year
about
some
sort
of
standard
color
table
that
icons
should
follow
say
to
colors
including
colors
for
a
small
grey
scale
but
no
one
responded
at
all
the
problem
is
that
if
the
colors
for
icons
are
just
used
willynilly
you
will
soon
find
that
the
workstations
color
table
devotes
itself
solely
the
window
manager
icons
and
other
adminstrative
tasks
instead
of
applications
that
actually
require
the
colors
for
proper
working
color
needful
applications
such
as
picture
and
graphic
displayers
animation
real
time
video
raytracers
etc
the
following
is
a
suggested
color
table
for
icons
and
general
use
icons
window
managers
and
general
applications
should
follow
this
table
or
something
like
it
unless
the
application
is
color
needful
for
each
primary
color
redgreenblue
three
colors
eg
values
and
this
results
in
colors
representing
most
of
the
standard
colors
for
use
in
icons
two
extra
shades
of
grey
eg
vales
black
and
whitered
other
colors
probably
of
some
primary
color
to
provide
shading
a
and
look
to
buttons
and
titlebars
in
the
window
manager
this
table
represents
colors
and
represents
a
large
range
of
posibilities
for
the
