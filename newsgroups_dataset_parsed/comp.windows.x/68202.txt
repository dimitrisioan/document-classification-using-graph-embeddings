HELP
NEEDED
CALLBACKS
ACTIONS
AND
EVENTS
I
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
METHODS
TO
CONNECT
APPLICATION
CODE
TO
WIDGETS
CALLBACKS
AND
ACTIONS
THE
PROBLEM
I
FACE
NOW
IS
THAT
I
HAVE
A
QUITE
LONG
PIECE
OF
APPLICATION
CODE
THAT
PERFORMS
A
LOT
OF
DRAWING
INTO
A
WINDOW
I
WANT
TO
CONNECT
THIS
TO
A
WIDGET
NO
PROBLEM
SO
FAR
I
COULD
USE
A
CALLBACK
FUNCTION
OR
AN
ACTION
TO
DO
THIS
PROCESSING
ANY
EVENTS
AFTERWARDS
BUT
BECAUSE
THE
DRAWING
TAKES
SOME
WHILE
I
WANT
THE
APPLICATION
CODE
SEQUENCE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BE
INTERRUPTED
BY
EVENTS
THEN
I
WANT
TO
HANDLE
THE
EVENTS
AND
RESUME
WITH
PROCESSING
THE
APPLICATION
CODE
AT
THE
POINT
IT
WAS
INTERRUPTED
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THIS
ISNT
POSSIBLE
BUT
HOW
CAN
I
GIVE
THE
USER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
HIS
INPUTS
ARE
IMMEDIATELY
PROCESSED
HAS
ANYBODY
AN
IDEA
PLEASE
ANSWER
VIA
EMAIL
THANKS

ADVANCE
