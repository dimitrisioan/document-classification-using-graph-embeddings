WE
ARE
ADDING
A
MOTIF
WRAPPER
TO
A
FAMILY
OF
DATA
DISPLAY
PROGRAMS
THESE
PROGRAMS
ARE
EACH
WRITTEN
AS
A
MAIN
LOOP
WITH
THESE
STEPS
USE
SEMOP
TO
CHECK
A
SEMAPHORE
AND
IF
TRUE
ACCESS
NEW
DATA
OTHERWISE
BLOCK
NEW
DATA
COMES
QUITE
OFTEN
USE
MSGOP
TO
CHECK
FOR
MESSAGES
AND
IF
TRUE
READ
THEM
OTHERWISE
CONTINUE
MESSAGES
ARE
USER
COMMANDS
AND
NOT
OFTEN
UPDATE
THE
DISPLAY
ACCORDING
TO
LATEST
DATA
AND

WE
TYPICALLY
HAVE
SEVERAL
OF
THESE
RUNNING
IN

PLUS
A

PRODUCER
SERVING
SOME

EVERYONE
BLOCKING
MAKES
SURE
THE

CH
DISCUSSES
ADDING
A
FILEWATCHER
AND
ALSO
HOW
TO
ADD
WORKPROCS
THAT
ARE
RUN
DURING
IDLE
TIME
WE
CAN
OPENUP
OUR
EXISTING
MAIN
LOOP
AND
CALL
IT
AS
A
WORKPROC
THE
PROBLEM
IS
OUR
BLOCKING
UNTIL
NEW
DATA
IS
NO
LONGER
APPROPRIATE
NEITHER
IS
LETTING
THE
PROGRAM
FREERUN
BECAUSE
OTHERS
ARE
HURT
THE
UNIX
SELECT
CALL
LETS
YOU
BLOCK
UNTIL
ANY

WE
WANT
THAT
