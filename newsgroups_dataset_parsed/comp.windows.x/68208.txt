BENJAMIN
JONES
WRITES
IVE
RUN
INTO
A
BIT
OF
A
SNAG
WHILE
TRYING
TO
GET
MAC
X
UP
AND
RUNNING
AND
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
RESPONSES
FROM
ANYONE
WHO
MAY
HAVE
SEEN
THIS
PROBLEM
ON
MY
LOCAL
NETWORK
I
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
MACS
SUNS
AND
SGI
MACHINES
I
HAVE
INSTALLED
MACXMACTCP
ON
ALL
OF
THE
MACINTOSHES
AND
CAN
RUN
XCLIENTS
ON
THE
SGI
MACHINES
ALL
THE
LIVELONG
DAY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
RUN
AN
XCLIENT
ON
ANY
SUN
I
SETUP
THE
COMMAND
IN
MACX
THEN
EXECUTE
IT
NOTHING
HAPPENS
I
DONT
EVEN
GET
ANY
COMMAND
OUTPUT
NOW
I
THOUGHT
IT
MIGHT
BE
A
ROUTING
ISSUE
BUT
I
CAN
RUN
REMOTE
XCLIENTS
ON
THE
SUNS
FROM
MY
SGI
MACHINES
AS
WELL
AS
VICEVERSA
I
CAN
ALSO
RUN
REMOTE
XCLIENTS
ON
SGI
MACHINES
THAT
ARE
NOT
ON
MY
LOCAL
NET
HERE
BUT
THE
ABOVE
PROBLEM
HOLDS
TRUE
FOR
NONLOCAL
SUNS
AS
WELL
I
TRIED
TO
SEND
THIS
AS
PRIVATE
MAIL
BUT
MAIL
TO
BENJOSSAHQNASAGOV
WAS
REJECTED
SO
HERE
IT
IS
HERE
IS
AN
EXTRACT
FROM
THE
README
FILE
THAT
COMES
WITH
MACX
USERS
OF
REMOTE
COMMANDS
WITH
SUN
MACHINES
MAY
FIND
THAT
THEIR
REMOTE
COMMANDS
APPEAR
TO
DO
NOTHING
AND
THERE
IS
NO
OUTPUT
FROM
THE
SUN
MACHINE
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
A
FEATURE
OF
THE
SUN
REXECD
NETWORK
DAEMON
WHICH
QUIETLY
DISCONNECTS
FROM
REQUESTING
MACHINES
THAT
ARE
NOT
KNOWN
TO
THE
SUNS
NETWORK
ADDRESS
ETCHOSTS
OR
NIS
HOSTS
DATABASE
TO
SUCCESSFULLY
USE
REMOTE
COMMANDS
WITH
A
SUNOSBASED
MACHINE
THERE
MUST
BE
AN
ENTRY
IN
THE
NETWORK
ADDRESS
DATABASE
FOR
THE
MACINTOSH

IS
