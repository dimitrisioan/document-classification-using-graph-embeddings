JAMES
F
ALLMAN

WRITES
IM
DOING
A
STUDY
ON
WHAT
THE
FOLLOWING
TYPE
OF
USERS
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HAVE
ON
A
UNIX
MANAGER
BASICALLY
IM
LOOKING
FOR
THE
UNIX
COMMANDS
AND
FEATURES
ON
MOTIF
WINDOW
INTERFACE
WHICH
WILL
HELP
THE
DIFFERENT
TYPE
OF
USERS
MAKE
USE
OF
UNIX
PERSONALLY
I
CANT
STAND
MOTIF
I
ALSO
CANT
STAND
GUI
COMMAND
LINE
INTERFACES
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
ACCESS
TO
THE
COMMANDS
I
KNOW
COMMAND
LINE
AND
LOVE
I
THINK
YOULL
FIND
THAT
EXPERIENCE
SIC
USERS
COMMAND
LINE
DER
MOUSE
A
YEAR
AND
A
HALF
AGO
I
FELT
THE
SAME
WAY
THE
I
STARTED
USING
GOOYIES
GIVE
ME
THE
COMMAND
LINE
WHEN
SOMETHING
OUT
OF
THE
ORDINARY
NEEDS
DONE
AND
THE
GOOY
WHEN
I
AM
DOING
NORMAL
OR
REPATIVE
WORK
NOTE
THAT
MOST
OPERATIONS
ARE
REPETATIVE
HACKERS
LOVE
CLS
BECAUSE
WHAT
I
LIKE
ABOUT
GUIS
THE
ABILITY
TO
VIEW
AND
MANIPULATE
A
GROUP
OF
OBJECTS
FILES
TEXT
DIRECTORIES
ETC
AND
AND
MANIPULATE
THEM
IN
SOME
WAY
SUCH
AS
DELETE
COPY
PASTE
RENAME
THE
ABILITY
TO
HAVE
SEVERAL
APPLICATIONS
SCREENS
VISIBLE
AND
ACCESSABLE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
BEING
ABLE
TO
DO
A
STANDARD
SET
OF
FUNCTIONS
EASILY
AND
QUICKLY
ON
AN
UNFAMILIAR
OPERATING
SYSTEM
I
AM
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
COMMAND
LINES
OF
SEVERAL
OPERATING
SYSTEMS
BUT
OCCASIONALLY
I
WILL
HAVE
TO
SOME
WORK
ON
A
SYSTEM
THAT
I
ALMOST
NEVER
USE
IF
IT
HAS
A
GUI
I
CAN
USUALLY
ACCOMPLISH
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
DO
FAIRLY
EASILY
THE
COMMAND
LINE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
OFTEN
IS
A
LONG
AND
PAINFUL
EXPERIENCE
WHAT
I
HATE
ABOUT
GUIS
HAVING
TO
SWITCH
BETWEEN
THE
MOUSE
AND
THE
KEYBOARD
I
GUESS
I
HAVE
A
STRONG
ONEHANDED
PREFERENCE
I
LIKE
TO
USE
A
COMPUTER
WITH
ONE
HAND
AND
USE
THE
OTHER
FOR
HOLDING
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
PIECE
OF
PAPER
OF
A
MUG
OF
TEA
I
HAVE
CONFIGURED
MY
FAVORITE
EDITOR
SO
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
EDITING
FUNCTIONS
CAN
BE
DONE
WITH
ONE
HAND
SUCH
AS
NAVIGATING
CUTTING
PASTING
SEARCHING
OPENING
AND
SAVING
FILES
ETC
THE
MAIN
THING
I
NEED
TO
USE
BOTH
HANDS
FOR
IS
ENTERING
TEXT
I
GUESS
I
NEED
TO
GET
ONE
OF
THOSE
MICE
WITH
LIKE
BUTTONS
OR
SOMETHING
AND
THEN
I
WILL
HAVE
THE
BEST
OF
BOTH
WORLDS
BRENT
