INTERACTIVE
PERFORMANCE
WE
RECENTLY
GOT
AN
NCD
XTERMINAL
TO
EVALUATE
THIS
IS
RUNNING
XREMOTE
OVER
A
SERIAL
LINE
I
WANTED
TO
GET
SOME
MEASUREMENT
OF
RESPONSE
TIME
SO
I
WROTE
A
SMALL
XLIB
PROGRAM
WHICH
SIMPLY
CREATES
A
WINDOW
MAPS
IT
AND
SENDS
THE
FIRST
EXPOSE
EVENT
TO
ITSELF
THE
PROGRAM
TIMES
THE
DELAY
FROM
SENDING
THE
EVENT
TO
RECEIVING
IT
I
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
THE
SIMPLEST
WAY
TO
TEST
CLIENTXSERVER
ROUNDTRIP
DELAYS
ITS
A
SIMILAR
CONCEPT
TO
THE
PROGRAM
IS
THIS
A
VALID
TEST
TO
PERFORM
IVE
ALSO
TRIED
THE
XBENCH
PROGRAM
AVAILABLE
FROM
FTPUUNET
WHICH
BOMBARDS
THE
SERVER
WITH
GRAPHICS
OPERATIONS
BUT
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
GET
A
QUANTATIVE
MEASURE
OF
WHAT
IS
ACCEPTABLE
INTERACTIVE
RESPONSE
TIME
HAS
ANYONE
GOT
ANY
IDEAS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
