x
interactive
performance
we
recently
got
an
ncd
xterminal
to
evaluate
this
is
running
xremote
over
a
serial
line
i
wanted
to
get
some
measurement
of
response
time
so
i
wrote
a
small
xlib
program
which
simply
creates
a
window
maps
it
and
sends
the
first
expose
event
to
itself
the
program
times
the
delay
from
sending
the
event
to
receiving
it
i
thought
this
was
the
simplest
way
to
test
clientxserver
roundtrip
delays
its
a
similar
concept
to
the
program
is
this
a
valid
test
to
perform
ive
also
tried
the
xbench
program
available
from
ftpuunet
which
bombards
the
server
with
graphics
operations
but
i
just
wanted
to
get
a
quantative
measure
of
what
is
acceptable
interactive
response
time
has
anyone
got
any
ideas
on
this
subject
