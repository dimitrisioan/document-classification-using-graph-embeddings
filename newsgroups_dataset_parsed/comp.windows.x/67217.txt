PROBLEMS
ON
AIX
I
AM
TRYING
TO
BUILD
AND
USE
IMAKE
ON
AN
IBM
RUNNING
AIX
I
AM
HAVING
THE
FOLLOWING
PROBLEMS
MANY
OF
MY
IMAKEFILES
HAVE
CONTRUCTS
LIKE
THIS
IS
A
MAKEFILE
AT
THE
START
OF
LINES
TO
PASS
MAKEFILE
COMMENTS
THRU
THE
C
PREPROCESSOR
AND
INTO
THE
MAKEFILE
MOST
OF
THE
C
PREPROCESSORS
THAT
I
HAVE
USED
WILL
NOT
TREAT
SUCH
A
AS
APPEARING
AT
THE
START
OF
THE
LINE
THUS
THE
C
PREPROCESSOR
DOES
NOT
TREAT
THE
HASH
SYMBOL
AS
THE
START
OF
A
DIRECTIVE
HOWEVER
THE
IBM
CPP
STRIPS
THE
COMMENT
AND
TREATS
THE
HASH
SYMBOL
AS
THE
START
OF
A
DIRECTIVE
THE
CPP
FAILS
WHEN
IT
DETERMINES
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
A
KNOWN
DIRECTIVE
I
HAVE
TEMPORARILY
HACKED
MY
IMAKE
TO
HANDLE
THIS
SITUATION
BUT
WOULD
LIKE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
BETTER
FIX
SEVERAL
IMAKEFILES
USE
AS
A
PARAMETER
TO
A
MACRO
WHEN
A
PARTICULAR
USE
OF
THE
MACRO
DOES
NOT
NEED
A
VALUE
FOR
THE
PARAMETER
THE
AIX
CPP
GIVES
WARNINGS
ABOUT
THESE
SITUATIONS
BUT
CONTINUES
TO
WORK
OK
IF
YOU
ARE
FAMILIAR
WITH
THESE
PROBLEMS
AND
HAVE
SOLUTIONS
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
ON
YOUR
SOLUTIONS
PERHAPS
THIS
IS
SOLVED
IN
A
LATER
VERSION
OF
IMAKE
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
REVIEWED
ALSO
DO
YOU
KNOW
OF
OTHER
CPPS
THAT
BEHAVE
SIMILARLY
SINCE
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
EASY
ACCESS
TO
NEWS
A
RESPONSE
TO
WHITEBILLYPOGISPRCCOM
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
