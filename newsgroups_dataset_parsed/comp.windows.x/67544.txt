HI
I
AM
USING
XDM
ON
WITH
AND
ON
AND
SPARCS
RUNNING
SUNOS
PRIOR
TO
USING
XDM
I
USED
TO
SET
PATH
AND
OTHER
ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES
LIKE
MANPATH
HELPPATH
ARCH
ETC
IN
MY
LOGIN
FILE
WITH
XDM
THE
LOGIN
FILE
DOESNT
GET
EXECUTED
AND
THEREFORE
NEITHER
THE
OLWM
ROOTWINDOW
NOR
MY
APPLICATIONS
KNOW
ABOUT
THESE
VARIABLES
I
ALWAYS
USE
THE
FOLLOWING
IN
MY
TCSHRC
F
LOGIN
THEN
SOURCE
HOMELOGIN
ENDIF
AND
IN
LOGIN
SETENV
LOGIN
SO
I
DONT
NEED
TO
SET
ALL
ENVIRONMENT
VARIABLES
IN
MY
CSHRC
BUT
THEY
GET
SET
IF
I
LOGIN
VIA
XDM
OR
XON
XRSH
RX
AND
SO
ON
