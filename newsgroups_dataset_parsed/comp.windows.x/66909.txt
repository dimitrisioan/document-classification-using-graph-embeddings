the
plplot
package
is
freely
distributable
but
not
in
the
public
domain
the
plplot
source
code
except
header
files

may
not
be
used

package
without

of
the
authors
you
are
allowed
and
encouraged
to
include
the
plplot
object
library
and
header
files
in
a
commercial

provided
that
it
is
explicitly
and
prominently
stated
that
the
plplot
library
is
freely
available
and
the
full
copyrights
on
the
plplot
package
be
displayed
somewhere
in
the
documentation
for
the
package
we
welcome
suggestions
on
how
to
improve
this
code
especially
in
the
form
of
usercontributed
enhancements
or
bug
fixes
if
plplot
is
used
in
any
published
papers
please
include
an
acknowledgment
or
citation
of
our
work
which
will
help
us
to
continue
improving
plplot
also
please
remember
that
as
plplot
is
not
a
commercial
product
we
cannot
be
expected
to
offer
the
kind
of
support
that
a
commercial
product
may
there
is
great
interest
in
extending
plplot
and
fixing
bugs
but
the
principal
authors
can
only
afford
to
work
on
it
part
time
improvements
will
necessarily
focus
on
those
which
help
us
get
our
work
done
