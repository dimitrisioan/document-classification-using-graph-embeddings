I
POSTED
THIS
A
WHILE
AGO
AND
DIDNT
RECIEVE
ONE
REPLY
AND
NOW
WE
HAVE
ANOTHER
BUG
REPORT
ON
THE
SAME
SUBJECT
CAN
ANYBODY
HELP
ME
OUT
HOW
CAN
YOU
ENSURE
THAT
ACCELERATORS
WORK
THE
SAME
INDEPENDENT
OF
CASE
WHAT
I
WANT
IS
CTRLO
AND
CTRLO
TO
BOTH
BE
ACCELERATORS
ON
ONE
MENU
ENTRY
IN
ORA
VOL
IN
THE
SECTION
ON
ACCELERATORS
IT
SAYS
FOR
INFORMATION
ON
HOW
TO
SPECIFY
TRANSLATION
TABLES
SEE
VOL
THIS
IS
SO
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
TO
PUT
FOR
THE
XMNACCELERATOR
RESOURCE
IF
YOU
GO
TO
VOL
IT
SAYS
LIKEWISE
IF
A
MODIFIER
IS
SPECIFIED
THERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
PROHIBIT
OTHER
MODIFIERS
FROM
BEING
PRESENT
AS
WELL
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
TRANSLATION
SHIFTKEYQ
QUIT
WILL
TAKE
EFFECT
EVEN
IF
THE
CTRL
KEY
IS
HELD
DOWN
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AS
THE
SHIFT
KEY
AND
THE
Q
KEY
THIS
IMPLIES
TO
ME
THAT
SETTING
XMNACCELERATOR
TO
CTRLKEYO
SHOULD
DO
WHAT
I
WANT
BUT
IT
DOESNT
IT
DOESNT
WORK
IF
THE
USER
PRESSES
THE
CONTROL
KEY
THE
SHIFT
