YOU

TO
BE
A
LITTLE
CONFUSED
THE
SOCIALISTIC
HACKERS
WHO
YELL
ABOUT
PROPRIETARY
SOFTWARE
ARE
HARDLY
ENAMORED
OF
MOTIF
WHICH
IS
JUST
AS
OBJECTIONABLE
TO
THAT
MINDSET
AS
NEWS
IS
IF
I
MIGHT
WEAR
MY
SOCIALISTIC
HACKER
HAT
FOR
A
MOMENT
I
TAR
NEWS
AND
MOTIF
WITH
THE
SAME
BRUSH
AND
THAT
BRUSH
IS
NOT

I
WAS

THE
TWO
I
WAS
RESPONDING
TO
THE
SWEET
BLITHE
STATEMENT
IN
FROM
RICKDIGIBDDIGIBDCOM
RICK
RICHARDSON
RICK
THIS
IS
ONE
AREA
WHERE
MICROSOFT
NT
HAS
A
BIG
ADVANTAGE
SINCE
RICK
THEY
CONTROL
THE
WHOLE
SHOW
THERE
ARE
NO
ISSUES
LIKE
THIS
WHERE
RICK
LICENSEES
CREATE
INCOMPATIBLE
DEFACTO
STANDARDS
THIS
HAPPY
STATEMENT
SHOWS
A
MINDSET
THAT
INVENTORS
AND
COMPANIES
HAVE
WHEN
THEY
ARE
PLEASED
WITH
SOMETHING
THAT
WORKS
AND
THEY
BELIEVE
THAT
OTHERS
WILL
ALSO
BE
HAPPY
TO
USE
IT
I
REMEMBER
WHEN
SUNVIEW
WAS
HOT
STUFF
AND
AM
NOT
BY
THAT
STATEMENT
ENDORSING
SUN
AND
ITS
PRODUCTS
THIS
IS
JUST
MY
EXPERIENCE
AND
WHEN
OPENWINDOWS
BECAME
HOT
STUFF
THAT
WAS
WHEN
I
STARTED
HEARING
AS
MENTIONED
BEFORE
THE
SOCIALISTIC
MASSES
THAT
WERE
BENT
ON
DESTROYING
ANYTHING
THAT
WAS
DEEMED
PROPRIETARY
INCLUDING
OPENWINDOWS
I
MENTIONED
MOTIF
IN
THE
SAME
BREATH
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
WHAT
SUN
HAS
DECIDED
TO
TURN
ITS
ATTENTION
TO
NOT
BECAUSE
I
HATE
IT
MR
RICHARDSONS
POSITION
I
BELIEVE
IS
A
HEALTHY
ONE
AND
I
AM
SURE
THAT
THE
SEETHING
HACKERS
WILL
SOON
TRY
TO
FLAME
AND
DESTROY
NT
IF
IT
EVER
SHOWS
UP
WANTING
INSTEAD
EVERYTHING
TO
BE
FREE
AND
THEN
COMPLAINING
WHEN
THERE
IS
NO
ORGANIZED
STRUCTURE
AND
THERE
ARE
NO
DE
FACTO
STANDARDS
IT
WAS
JUST
A
VENT
FOR
FRUSTRATION
BROUGHT
ON
