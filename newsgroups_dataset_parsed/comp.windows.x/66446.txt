WHAT
HAS
THIS
GOT
TO
DO
WITH
COMPWINDOWSX
I
AGREE
THAT
THIS
IS
A
SIDE
TRACK
BUT
IT
IS
FUNNY
THAT
I
SKIP
SO
MANY
OTHER
ARTICLES
THREADS
BUT
I
COULDNT
RESIST
READING
THIS
ONE
MY
BELIEFS
OPINIONS
AND
EXPRESSIONS
ARE
STRICTLY
MY
OWN
AND
DO
NOT
REPRESENT
OR
REFLECT
ANY
OFFICIAL
OR
UNOFFICIAL
POLICIES
OR
ATTITUDES
OF
ANY
OTHER
PERSON
OR
ORGANIZATION
BUT
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
FORD
MOTOR
COMPANY
HAS
HAD
A
RECRUITING
BIAS
TOWARD
ENGINEERS
AND
AWAY
FROM
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
GRADUATES
THE
REASONING
IS
SUPPOSEDLY
TO
BETTER
MEET
LONG
RANGE
PERSONNEL
REQUIREMENTS
THIS
IS
EVIDENCED
BY
THE
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
CS
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
EMPLOYED
VIA
CONTRACTS
AND
ARE
NOT
BROUGHT
ON
BOARD
EXCEPT
IN
SPECIAL
CIRCUMSTANCES
THIS
IS
A
GENERALIZATION
WHICH
OBVIOUSLY
DOESNT
ALWAYS
HOLD
TRUE
BUT
THERE
ARE
STATISTICS
FURTHERMORE
MOST
SOFTWARE
ENGINEERING
AT
FORD
GETS
DONE
BY
ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERS
I
KNOW
OF
UNIVERITIES
THAT
HAVE
MERGED
THE
COMPUTER
SCIENCE
DEPARTMENT
AND
THE
ELECTRICAL
ENGINEERING
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
GET
A
COMPUTER
DEGREE
WHICH
QUALIFIES
YOU
FOR
MUCH
MORE
THAN
PROGRAMMING
BUT
SINCE
MY
BELIEFS
AND
OPINIONS
ARE
MERELY
FIGMENTS
OF
MY
DISTORTED
IMAGINATION
I
SUPPOSE
I
SHOULD
KEEP
IT
TO
MYSELF
