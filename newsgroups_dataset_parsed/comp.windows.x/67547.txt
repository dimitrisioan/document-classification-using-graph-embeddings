ERROR
CAN
ANYONE
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHY
THE
COLORMAP
ELEMENT
OF
SETWINATTRIB
MUST
BE
A
LEGITIMATE
TRUECOLOR
COLORMAP
SO
USE
XCREATECOLORMAP
WITH
THE
PROPER
VISUAL
AND
USE
IT
IN
SETWINATTRIB
AND
DONT
FORGET
THE
MASK
AND
THE
INEVITABLE
CAVEAT
I
USUALLY
USE
WIDGETS
SETTING
THE
VISUAL
AND
COLORMAP
RESOURCES
RATHER
THAN
DIRECT
X
ROUTINES
SO
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
BUT
I
THINK
THIS
IS
THE
GENERAL
DIFFICULTY
