this
results
in
a
badmatch
error
can
anyone
please
tell
me
why
the
colormap
element
of
setwinattrib
must
be
a
legitimate
truecolor
colormap
so
use
xcreatecolormap
with
the
proper
visual
and
use
it
in
setwinattrib
and
dont
forget
the
mask
and
the
inevitable
caveat
i
usually
use
widgets
setting
the
visual
and
colormap
resources
rather
than
direct
x
routines
so
i
could
be
wrong
but
i
think
this
is
the
general
difficulty
