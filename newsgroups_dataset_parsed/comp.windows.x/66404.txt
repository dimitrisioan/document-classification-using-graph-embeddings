CONVERTING
COLOR
GIF
TO
X
PIXMAP
I
HAVE
LOOKED
THROUGH
THE
FAQ
SECTIONS
AND
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
A
ANSWER
FOR
THIS
I
HAVE
AN
XMOTIF
APPLICATION
THAT
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
I
HAVE
A
COUPLE
OF
GIF
FILES
OR
PICT
THAT
I
HAVE
SCANNED
IN
WITH
A
COLOR
SCANNER
NOW
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
CONVERT
THE
GIF
FILES
INTO
A
FORMAT
THAT
COULD
BE
READ
INTO
MY
APPLICATION
AND
DISPLAYED
ON
THE
BACKGROUND
OF
ITS
MAIN
WINDOW
PREFERABLY
WITH
PIXMAPS
OR
PERHAPS
AS
AN
XIMAGE
I
HAVE
FOUND
FUNCTIONS
IN
THE
PBMPLUS
PROGRAM
SUITE
TO
CONVERT
GIF
TO
XBM
BUT
THAT
IS
MONOCHROME
AND
I
REALLY
DO
NEED
COLOR
I
HAVE
LOOKED
AT
XV
WHICH
READS
IN
GIF
AND
WRITES
OUT
SEVERAL
FORMATS
BUT
HAVE
NOT
FOUND
A
WAY
TO
WRITE
OUT
A
FILE
WHICH
CAN
BE
READ
IN
AS
A
PIXMAP
IS
THERE
AN
EASY
WAY
TO
DO
THIS
