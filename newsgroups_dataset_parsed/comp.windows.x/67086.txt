the
same
setup
usunix
layout
keyboard
i

the
sunkbd
patch
though
i
i
want
to
setup
the
backgroud
root
window
of
the
tvtwm
display
to
display
the
escherknot
etc
grey
is
a
very
boring
colour
to
work
on
make
sure
youre
using
ssetroot
which
comes
with
tvtwm
when
tvtwm
starts
up
it
nukes
the
existing
root
window
use
an
ssetroot
after
tvtwm
starts
up
you
could
spawn
off
a
sleep
ssetroot
you
can
also
use
virtualdesktopbackgroundpixmap
filename
or
just
virtualdesktopbackground
if
you
just
want
another
color
besides
grey
ii
when
i
open
an
xterm
on
the
sparc
not
all
of
the
keys
are
recognised
and
some
keys
on
the
keyboard
are
not
sending
the
correct
characters
did
you
install
the
sunkbd
patch
its
in
the
contrib
directory

though
i
cant
seem
to

an
xterm
to
get
passed
