WRITES
I
HAVE
A
SUN
THAT
HAS
A
MONO
FRAMEBUFFER
BUILT
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
THE
SAME
SYSTEM
ALSO
HAS
A
CGFOUR
AND
DAUGHTERBOARD
I
HAVE
BEEN
USING
THIS
SYSTEM
WITH
A
COLOR
MONITOR
HAVING
A
COLOR
FRONT
SCREEN
FROM
THE
CGFOUR
AND
A
MONO
BACK
SCREEN
FROM
THE
BOTH
ON
THE
SAME
TUBE
I
RECENTLEY
PICKED
UP
A
X
SUN
MONO
MONITOR
AND
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
MAKE
A
TWO
HEADED
SYSTEM
WITH
THE
AND
THE
I
DO
NOT
CARE

THE
BACK

PAGE
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
HAS
ANYBODY
SUCESSFULY
DONE
THIS
BEFORE
IF
ITS
ANY
CONSOLATION
I
HAVE
TWO
SYSTEMS
THOUGH
THE
COLOR

MONO
MONITORS
FOR
EACH
ARE
RATED
THEIR
CONFIGURATION
IS
THE
SAME
AS
YOURS
SO
IT
SHOULD
BE
A
PLUGNPLAY
SITUATION
EXCEPT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
YOUR
HIRES
MONO
MONITOR
WILL
FUNCTION
THIS
WAY
HOWEVER
YOU
MAY
SIMPLY
BE
ABLE
TO
PULL
THE
MOTHERBOARD
AND
SET
THE
HIRES
JUMPER
LOCATED
IN
THE
SAME
JUMPER
ARRAY
AS
THE
JUMPERS
FOR
THE
RAMSIMM
SELECTS
AND
ETHERNET
CONNECTION
AND
BE
HAPPILY
ON
YOUR
WAY
WHEN
YOU
PULL
THE
MOTHERBOARD
THE
JUMPERS
ARE
IN
THE
LEFTREAR
