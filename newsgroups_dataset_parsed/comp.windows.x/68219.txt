THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
WE
NEED
SOLUTIONS
FOR
APPLICATIONS
NOW
AND
ALTHOUGH
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HAVE
MOST
OF
THE
THINGS
MENTIONED
HERE
SOMEBODY
HAS
TO
WRITE
IT
WHAT
ID
LIKE
TO
SEE
IS
THIS
SCENARIO
EACH
WIDGET
VIEW
WHATEVER
DESCRIBES
ITS
COLORS
VIA
A
PALETTE
PALETTES
CAN
BE
SHARED
AND
THEY
ONLY
CONTAIN
DESCRIPTIVE
INFORMATION
THEY
ARE
NOT
DIRECTLY
TIED
TO
THE
OBJECT
THAT
USES
THEM
PALETTES
ARE
HELD
IN
THE
SERVER
A
PALETTE
CAN
ACCOMADATE
UP
TO
THE
NUMBER
OF
HARDWARE
COLOR
CELLS
OF
COLOR
DESCRIPTORS
WHEN
THE
INPUT
FOCUS
IS
IN
A
PARTICULAR
WIDGET
THAT
WIDGET
HAS
ACCESS
TO
ALL
OF
THE
COLORS
THAT
ARE
DESCRIBED
IN
ITS
ASSOCIATED
PALETTE
ALL
OTHER
WIDGETS
TRANSIENTLY
GET
THE
CLOSEST
APPROXIMATION
THAT
CAN
BE
GENERATED
BY
A
UNION
OF
THE
COLORS
FROM
THE
CURRENT
PALETTE
AND
ANY
FREE
COLORS
THAT
ARE
LEFT
OVER
A
WIDGET
SPECIFIES
A
COLOR
FOR
IMAGING
BY
PROVIDING
AN
INDEX
PIXEL
INTO
ITS
ASSOCIATED
PALETTE
THE
BOLD
PART
ABOVE
IS
HARD
AND
WOULD
NEED
TO
BE
DONE
IN
THE
SERVER
