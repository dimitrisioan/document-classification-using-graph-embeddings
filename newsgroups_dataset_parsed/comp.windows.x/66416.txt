re
teleuse
uimx
and
c
does
anyone
have
any
good
ideas
on
how
to
integrate
c
code
elegantly
with
teleuse
uimx
interface
architect
generated
code
source
would
be
great
but
any
suggestions
are
welcome
its
my
understanding
that
the
next
release
of
uimx
due
out
last
february
has
full
support
for
c
i
use
xdesigner
which
does
not
have
the
interpreter
or
ui
meta
languages
of
these
other
tools
but
does
fully
support
c
code
generation
reusable
templates
via
c
classes
which
are
generated
a
variety
of
other
handy
features
for
using
c
and
layout
functions
in
different
ways
and
generates
motif
code
including
drag
n
drop
internationalization
etc
fits
in
quite
nicely
with
doug
youngs
paradigm
for
cmotif
available
in
the
us
from
vi
corp
in
europe
from
