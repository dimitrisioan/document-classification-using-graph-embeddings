has
anyone
found
a
fix
for
the
following
problem
client

sunos
server
hardware
sun
ipc
server
software
sunos
open
windows
w
patch
a
motif
application
will
periodically
hang
when
run
against
the
openwindows
server
xnews
the
pulldown
is
displayed
but
then
no
button
actions
have
any
effect
sometimes
pressing
return
will
unstick
the
application
but
not
usually
it
looks
like
the
pulldown
is
grabbing
the
focus
and
never
letting
go
other
windows
on
the
display
continue
to
get
updated
so
the
server
isnt
hanging
if
i
log
in
from
another
terminal
and
kill
the
motif
application
then
everything
gets
back
to
normal
the
same
application
when
run
against
other
x
servers
including
mit
xsun
decwindows
tektronix
x
terminal
has
no
problems
this
is
obviously
a
openwindows
problem
but
i
need
a
workaround
since
most
of
our
customers
are
openwindows
users
i
have
seen
the
same
problem
using
a
sparcstation
solaris
ow
in
my
case
it
happens
far
more
often
than
periodically
help
