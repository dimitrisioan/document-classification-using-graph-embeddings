JAY
GRAHAM
SAID
I
AM
DEVELOPING
AN
X
XTXM
APPLICATION
THAT
WILL
INCLUDE
A
GRAPHICS
WINDOW
OF
SOME
SORT
WITH
MOVING
SYMBOLS
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
A
PURE
X
APPLICATION
COULD
BE
IMPLEMENTED
WITH
MOTIF
WIDGETS
ONE
OF
WHICH
WOULD
BE
AN
XMDRAWINGAREA
FOR
DRAWING
WITH
XLIB
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
GRAPHICS
LIBRARY
GL
AVAILABLE
ON
OUR
IBM
SGIS
GL
I
BELIEVE
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
MIX
X
AND
GL
IN
ONE
APPLICATION
PROGRAM
CAN
I
USE
GL
SUBROUTINES
IN
AN
XMDRAWINGAREA

IN
AN

WINDOW
OPENED
BY
ME
WITH
XOPENWINDOW
IN
SGIS

OTHERS
AS
WELL
POSSIBLY
THEY
INCLUDE
SOURCE
CODE
FOR
A
GL
WIDGET
THAT
FITS
ON
TOP
OF
MOTIF
AND
ONE
THATS
XT
BASED
AS
WELL
YOU
MAY
WISH
TO
ASK
