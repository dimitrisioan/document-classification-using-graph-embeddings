RE
IDEAS
ON
XTERM
PASTE
IRRITATION
IN
WOLFCSSTANFORDEDU
WRITES
MOVING
THE
MOUSE
OUT
OF
THE
XTERM
WINDOW
BEFORE
CLICKING
UP
WILL
NOT
ABORT
THE
PASTE
IN
FACT
ONCE
THAT
MIDDLE
BUTTON
IS
PRESSED
DOWN
THE
PASTE
IS
INEVITABLE
SO
THE
OBVIOUS
QUESTIONS
IS
THERE
SOME
WAY
AROUND
THIS
AND
DO
OTHERS
FEEL
THAT
MOVING
THE
MOUSE
OUT
OF
AN
XTERM
WINDOW
BEFORE
RELEASE
SHOULD
ABORT
THE
PASTE
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
COMMON
ENOUGH
PROBLEM
THAT
SOMEONE
WOULD
HAVE
CHANGED
XTERM
BY
NOW
BUT
MAYBE
ITS
JUST
ME
MICHAEL
IT
IS
NOT
JUST
YOU
I
HAVE
BEEN
AGGRAVATED
MANY
TIMES
BY
THE
MOUSE
MAKING
HAY
OF
MY
MALADROITNESS
AND
WOULD
BE
EVER
GRATEFUL
TO
EVERYONE
WHO
WOULD
MAKE
KEYBOARD
ALTERNATIVES
FOR
ALL
MOUSE
ACTIONS
