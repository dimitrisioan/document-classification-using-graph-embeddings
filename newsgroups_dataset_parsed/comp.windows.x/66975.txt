RE

MULTI

FROM
ARTICLE
BY

E
NETO
RAINER
HOCHREITER
WRITES
IVE
SEEN
A
LOT
OF
DIFFERENT
TERMS
WHICH
SEEM
TO
MEAN
THE
SAME
THING
WHO
CAN
GIVE
AN
EXACT
DEFINITION
WHAT
THESE
TERMS
MEAN
MULTISCREEN
MULTIHEADED
MULTIDISPLAY
XSERVER
ZAPHOD
MODE
IS
THERE
A
LIMIT
HOW
MANY
SCREENSDISPLAYS
A
SINGLE
SERVER
CAN
HANDLE
IN
AN
ARTICEL
A
READ
SOMETHING
ABOUT
AN
UPPER
LIMIT
OF
HOW
IS
THE
CAPABILITY
CALLED
IF
I
WANT
TO
MOVE
THE
CURSOR
FROM
ONE
SCREENDISPLAY
TO
ANOTHER
AS
TO
HOW
MANY
CLIENTS
MAY
BE
DISPLAY
ON
A
SERVER
I
BELIEVE
THE
LIMIT
WOULD
BE
HOW
MUCH
MEMORY
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
YOUR
SERVER
OR
ALLOCATED
BY
THE
SERVER
THIS
ALL
SOUNDS
SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE
MY
COMPANY
MIGHT
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
THIS
BACKGROUND
FIRST
MEGATEK
HAS
A
SERIES
OF
FRAMEBUFFERS
DESIGNED
AS
X
ACCELERATORS
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THESE
ARE
DESIGNED
FOR
SUN
SBUS
AND
SUN
AND
OTHER
VENDORS
VME
SYSTEMS
THAT
SAID
MEGATEK
PRODUCTS
SUPPORT
MULTISCREEN
ANDOR
MULTIDISPLAY
ON
A
SIGLE
WORKSTATION
MOST
OF
OUR
CARDS
HAVE
A
KEYBOARDMOUSE
PORT
WHICH
CAN
BE
USED
TO
PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL
DISPLAYS
FOR
EXAMPLE
SAY
YOU
HADE
A
SPARCSTATION
WITH
AN
SBUS
EXPANSION
CHASSIS
YOU
COULD
PUT
IN
SIX
FRAMBUFFERS
ALLOWING
A
TOTAL
OF
SIX
SCREENS
IN
THE
SYSTEM
YOU
COULD
THEN
ATTACH
FROM
TO
KEYBOARDMICE
ALLOWING
YOU
TO
MIX
AND
MATCH
ANY
COMBINATION
OF
SCREENS
AND
DISPLAYS
YOU
COULD
HAVE
DISPLAY
DISPLAYS
DISPLAYS
OR
DISPLAY
AND
DISPLAY
BASICALLY
ANY
COMBINATION
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
WE
AT
MEGATEK
TRY
TO
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
ABOUT
THE
USE
OF
THE
WORDS
MULTISCREEN
AND
MULTIDISPLAY
THEY
ARE
QUITE
DIFFERENT
IN
MEANING
AND
AT
LEAST
IN
X
HAVE
EXACT
DEFINITIONS
THE
REASON
I
RAMBLE
LIKE
THIS
IS
THE
MENTION
OF
AN
UPPER
LIMIT
IF
SCREENS
IN
A
DISPLAY
AS
IT
SO
HAPPENS
THERES
A
DEFINE
IN
THE
SERVER
THAT
DETERMINES
THE
MOST
SCREENS
SUPPORTED
SERVERINCLUDEMISCH
MAXSCREENS
AS
RELEASED
MY
MIT
THIS
IS
AS
RELEASED
BY
MEGATEK
THIS
IS
AS
SUCH
THE
MOST
SCREENS
SUPPORTED
BY
A
SINGLE
MEGATEK
DISPLAY
IE
X
SERVER
IS
IF
SOMEONE
CONSTRUED
THIS
TO
BE
A
LIMITATION
OF
X
IM
SORRY
BUT
CLEARLY
AS
POINTED
OUT
SO
WELL
BY
MR
NETO
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
WE
JUST
DID
IT
HERE
BECAUSE
NOBODY
HAS
EVER
ASKED
US
FOR
MORE
OF
COURSE
I
COULD
SAY
BUY
ALL
YOU
WANT
WELL
