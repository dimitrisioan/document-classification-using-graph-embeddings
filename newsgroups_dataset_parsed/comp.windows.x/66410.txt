i
might
have
a
need
in
the
future
to
display
rotated
text
i
noticed
the
xvertext
package
on
the
net
it
looks
very
good
but
it
has
one
slight
problem
the
api
to
it
assumes
you
have
a
font
name
not
an
already
loaded
font
it
shouldnt
be
too
difficult
to
split
up
the
function
into
two
interface
routines
one
with
a
font
name
and
one
with
an
xfontstruct
but
i
thought
i
would
ask
the
author
alan
richardson
first
in
case
he
was
planning
this
already
unfortunately
his
email
address
bounced
does
alan
r
or
the
current
maintainer
of
xvertext
see
this
the
email
address
you
mentioned
above
is
for
use
with
the
uk
as
you
know
the
brits
do
everything
backwards
so
the
real
address
from
the
states
is
give
it
a
try
harvard
ucbvaxuwvaxastroatcftmsbrown
or
rutgers
internet
brownwiextrelcom
or
