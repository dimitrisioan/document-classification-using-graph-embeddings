why
did
x
designers
decide
to
not
associate
the
color
with
the
object
being
drawn
and
instead
associate
it
with
the
display
it
is
being
drawn
on
in
the
drawing
attributes
were
bundled
into
drawing
requests
that
is
the
servers
drawing
model
was
stateless
this
caused
problems
with
performance
and
network
traffic
so
the
redesign
included
the
graphic
context
to
codify
the
drawing
state
most
application
designers
who
want
to
draw
things
in
several
different
colors
create
a
gc
for
each
color
during
initialization
then
pass
the
gc
id
in
each
drawing
request
