seems
rather
interesting
but
i
fail
to
understand

reason
it
is
not
contained
in
at
most
newsgroups
i
am
subscribed
to
comptextinterleaf

i
could
care
less

am
sure
that
members
of
this
group
interested
in
the
topic
can
followup
by
looking
at
other
newsgroups
could
you
please
remove
the
comptextinterleaf
from
your
distribution
just
as
a
nettish
sort
of
courtesy
best
