i
have
written
an
app
which
brings
up
an
xwindow
and
i
want
at
the
click
of
the
mouse
to
dump
the
window
into
a
postscript
file
i
use
xwd
and
to
do
it
from
within
a
program
i
use
xwd
id
xxxxx
where
xxxxx
is
the
window
id
obtained
from
xtwindowwidget
he
asked
for
sources
the
portable
bitmap
tools
from
jef
poskanzer
jefwellsfcaus
include
filters
to
do
that
and
much
more
btw
the
tools
come
as
sources
the
sillyness
of
most
vendors
lets
you
stuck
with
binaries
anyway
have
a
look
onto
xgrabxgrabsc
it
does
the
imho
best
job
for
this
including
compression
