ideal
operating
system
was
death
blow
to
unix
gday
windows
nt
is
a
step
forward
but
not
by
much
i
guess
for
dos
users
who
think
multitasking
is
really
neat
add
puke
here
and
are
overjoyed
to
be
able
to
use
more
than
of
memory
its
a
major
improvement
for
windows
users
its
more
like
an
upgrade
with
facilities
most
unix
users
take
for
granted
most
of
windows
users
only
use
pcs
for
text
processing
or
running
applications
anyway
so
the
operating
system
features
are
not
even
a
real
issue
my
ideal
operating
system
binary
compatible
across
all
plaforms
it
should
recognize
binaries
and
configure
on
the
fly
so
i
dont
have
to
have
binmac
bindos
bindec
binsun
binhp
etc
multicpu
so
i
can
use
the
cpus
on
my
pc
and
ws
and
mac
and
transputers
and
dsps
i
dont
know
a
single
site
which
has
gone
for
a
single
vendor
i
am
not
going
to
tradein
per
transputer
or
ultrafast
fft
on
dsp
chips
note
nt
runs
on
symmetric
multicpu
systems
builtin
portable
guigraphics
tools
you
can
call
drawbutton
or
drawline
and
it
does
the
same
thing
no
matter
what
platform
or
display
it
should
also
translate
graphics
commands
onthefly
so
i
can
use
pc
graphics
sw
on
my
workstation
and
x
software
on
my
pc
i
think
guis
are
not
just
nice
to
have
but
essential
configurable
frontend
so
you
can
make
it
look
like
unix
or
dos
or
nt
or
and
run
shell
scripts
or
commandbat
files
object
oriented
so
i
can
program
easily
under
it
and
not
have
to
reinvent
the
wheel
if
the
networking
is
not
up
to
scratch
or
my
application
needs
to
access
sourceobject
code
on
the
fly
in
other
words
it
should
have
some
ai
capability
that
and
a
tight
clean
kernel
so
you
can
actually
understand
it
anyone
know
of
something
like
