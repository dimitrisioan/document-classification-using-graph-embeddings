xview
sun
xgl
performance
problem
ive
written
an
application
for
sparcstation
gx
under
openwindows
the
application
uses
xview
stuff
to
create
my
window
and
the
sun
xgl
graphics
library
for
rendering
into
the
canvas
the
application
does
realtime
animation
but
it
does
not
update
the
the
display
fast
enough
im
using
notifysetitimer
xview
call
to
periodically
kick
off
my
update
routine
and
its
not
happening
fast
enough
i
want
it
to
update
times
second
its
only
doing
about
also
it
appears
to
be
compute
bound
because
if
i
run
anything
else
while
my
appplication
is
up
the
update
rate
slows
down
even
more
any
ideas
thanks
