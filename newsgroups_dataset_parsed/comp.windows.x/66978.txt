re
compiling
help
heres
what
i
think
have
figured
out
all
i
need
to
do
is
install
the
disitribution
without
the
xserver
like
the
sonycf
file
defines
and
all
the
new
libraries
utils
etc
will
be
installed
and
my
old
server
from
will
still
work
this
will
allow
me
to
run
xview
and
have
up
and
running
does
the
server
interface
remain
the
same
with
all
changes
made
only
to
the
libs
another
question
is
it
likely
that
since
sun
is
dropping
ow
support
that
the
desktop
utils
like
the
file
manager
will
be
made
public
it
would
be
nice
if
companies
would
make
old
code
public
for
the
benefit
of
those
of
us
with
smaller
budgets

i

not
raise
taxes
on
the
middle
class
