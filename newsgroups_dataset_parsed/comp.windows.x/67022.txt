I
AM
DEVELOPING
AN
X
XTXM
APPLICATION
THAT
WILL
INCLUDE
A
GRAPHICS
WINDOW
OF
SOME
SORT
WITH
MOVING
SYMBOLS
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
A
PURE
X
APPLICATION
COULD
BE
IMPLEMENTED
WITH
MOTIF
WIDGETS
ONE
OF
WHICH
WOULD
BE
AN
XMDRAWINGAREA
FOR
DRAWING
WITH
XLIB
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
GRAPHICS
LIBRARY
GL
AVAILABLE
ON
OUR
IBM
SGIS
GL
I
BELIEVE
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
MIX
X
AND
GL
IN
ONE
APPLICATION
PROGRAM
CAN
I
USE
GL
SUBROUTINES
IN
AN
XMDRAWINGAREA
OR
IN
AN
X
WINDOW
OPENED
BY
ME
WITH
XOPENWINDOW
I
HAVE
NEVER
USED
GL
BEFORE
BUT
THE
DOC
ON
GL
WINOPEN
SAYS
THAT
THE
FIRST
TIME
WINOPEN
IS
CALLED
IT
OPENS
A
CONNECTION
TO
THE
SERVER
ALSO
MOST
OF
THE
GL
CALLS
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
A
DISPLAY
OR
GC
UNLIKE
MOST
X
CALLS
FROM
THIS
INITIAL
INFORMATION
IT
APPEARS
THAT
X
AND
GL
CANNOT
BE
MIXED
EASILY
IS
THIS
TRUE
DOES
