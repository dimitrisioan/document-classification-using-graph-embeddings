gui
study
do
users
want
to
build
solutions
let
me
point
out
that
both
guibased
wordprocessors
and
textbased
formatters
both
have
a
language
one
happens
to
be
mouse
and
actionbased
and
the
other
symbolbased
true
but
thats
beside
the
point
this
is
a
fact
about
an
abstract
model
of
what
the
gui
users
are
doing
not
about
what
they
actually
are
doing
this
abstract
model
is
only
apparent
from
the
perpective
of
a
programmer
of
the
system
nb
some
users
may
see
it
too
but
only
when
they
put
aside
the
work
at
hand
and
start
thinking
like
a
programmer
im
not
saying
that
the
programmers
perspective
is
evil
or
stunted
after
all
thats
what
i
do
too
i
am
saying
that
ui
designers
must
carefully
distinguish
between
the
userprogrammer
conceptual
models
and
they
must
ultimately
serve
the
user
of
the
system
not
the
builder
of
the
system
i
dont
recall
the
actual
stats
but
something
like
in
people
can
be
categorized
as
a
symbol
manipulator
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
more
about
the
meaning
and
basis
for
this
claim
at
any
rate
i
dont
think
this
is
evidence
that
of
users
think
like
programmers
bankers
financial
analysts
structural
engineers
these
are
all
people
whose
work
you
could
characterize
as
primarily
symbol
manipulation
but
what
they
do
is
not
programming
and
programming
is
not
required
to
do
what
they
do
to
restate
my
previous
point
yes
users
want
to
build
their
own
solutions
no
they
do
not
want
to
do
programming
to
accomplish
this
