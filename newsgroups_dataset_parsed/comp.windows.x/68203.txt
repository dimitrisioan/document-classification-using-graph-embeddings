MICHAEL
ELBEL
SAID
ME
AS
IS
EMU
WONT
WORK
ON
BSD
DERIVED
SYSTEMS
EG
SUNS
WITH
ME
ANYTHING
ELSE
THAN
A
CSH
THERE
IS
A
FIX
TO
THIS
WHICH
IS
VERY
ME
SHORT
REMOVE
ONE
LINE
OF
CODE
ILL
PUT
THIS
ON
EXPORT
TODAY
ITS
MORE
THAN
THAT
ACTUALLY
IN
THE
VERSION
ON
EXPORT
ONE
CANNOT
JUST
SPECIFY
A
POSIX
TTY
BEHAVIOUR
THE
POSIX
CONFIG
FILES
ARE
INCOMPLETE
WITHOUT
THOSE
OF
SOME
SPECIFIC
PLATFORMS
LIKE
SUNS
AND
DECS
I
LOOKED
TWICE
AT
PORTING
EMU
TO
LINUX
BUT
STOPPED
SHORT
BECUSE
OF
THE
TTY
PART
IS
THERE
A
CLEANER
VERSION
OF
EMU
THAT
SUPPORTS
POSIX
TTY
EXPLICITLY
HMM
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
YOU
DEFINE
CLEAN
JORDAN
IMPLEMENTED
THE
SYSTEM
DEPENDENT
STUFF
IN
A
WAY
THAT
YOU
HAVE
BASIC
IMPLEMENTATIONS
FOR
CALL
IT
OPERATING
SYSTEM
TYPES
THEN
YOU
GO
AHEAD
AND
WRITE
A
INCLUDE
FILE
FOR
YOUR
SPECIFIC
MACHINE
OR
OPERATING
SYSTEM
USING
THE
BASIC
IMPLEMENTATIONS
SINCE
BOTH
JORDAN
AND
I
HAVENT
ENCOUNTERED
A
OS
FLAVOR
YET
THAT
IS
FULLY
POSIX
WE
HAVENT
GOTTEN
AROUND
TO
REALLY
IMPLEMENT
AND
TEST
A
TOPLEVEL
INCLUDE
FILE
SPECIFICALLY
FOR
JUST
POSIX
THE
POSIX
ROUTINES
ARE
USED
IN
THE
SUN
SPECIFIC
FILE
TTYSUNI
FOR
EXAMPLE
BUT
HERE
WE
ALSO
USE
SOME
BSD
STUFF
ALL
IN
ALL
IT
STILL
IS
PROBABLY
BETTER
TO
IMPLEMENT
A
INCLUDE
FILE
FOR
EACH
AND
EVERY
OPERATING
SYSTEM
THAN
IFDEFING
IN
EXISTING
ONES
THE
TYPE
OF
MESS
THAT
CAN
RESULT
FROM
THAT
CAN
CLEARLY
BE
SEEN
IN
THE
XTERM
SOURCES
EVEN
IF
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
CODE
GETS
COPIED
ALMOST
UNCHANGED
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
THIS
ONLY
USES
UP
SOME
DISK
SPACE
SINCE
ONLY
THE
DRIVERS
ACTUALLY
INCLUDED
FROM
THE
TOPLEVEL
INCLUDE
FILE
WILL
BE
COMPILED
INTO
EMU
IT
SHOULDNT
BE
HARD
TO
COME
UP
WITH
A
TTYLINUXI
FILE
THAT
FULLY
RELIES
ON
THE
POSIX
STUFF
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
I
DONT
HAVE
A
LINUX
SYSTEM
AVAILABLE
TO
ME
SO
I
CANT
DO
THE
PORT
MYSELF
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
YOU
READ
THE
README
IN
TERMSYSDEP
AND
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
PROBLEMS
OR
QUESTIONS
CONTACT
ME
AND
WE
COULD
TRY
TO
SORT
THIS
OUT
UNFORTUNATELY
WE
HAVE
TO
RELY
ON
HELP
FROM
THE
NET
ON
THIS
PART
OF
EMU
SINCE
WE
JUST
DONT
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
THAT
MANY
DIFFERENT
SYSTEMS
