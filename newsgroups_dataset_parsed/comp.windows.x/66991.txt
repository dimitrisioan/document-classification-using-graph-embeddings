re
xwindows
always
opaque
writes
i
wonder
if
it
is
possible
for
a
parent
window
to
paint
over
the
area
of
its
childs
if
it
is
not
then
how
could
it
be
possible
to
implement
a
rubberband
across
multiple
xwindows
to
select
the
objects
that
are
displayed
one
in
each
window
use
a
gc
with
the
subwindowmode
attribute
set
to
includeinferiors
the
default
is
clipbychildren
however
beware
if
any
of
the
children
are
of
a
different
depth
to
the
parent
the
semantics
of
this
are
undefined
by
the
protocol
