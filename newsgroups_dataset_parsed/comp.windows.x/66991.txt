I
WONDER
IF
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
PARENT
WINDOW
TO
PAINT
OVER
THE
AREA
OF
ITS
CHILDS
IF
IT
IS
NOT
THEN
HOW
COULD
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
IMPLEMENT
A
RUBBERBAND
ACROSS
MULTIPLE
XWINDOWS
TO
SELECT
THE
OBJECTS
THAT
ARE
DISPLAYED
ONE
IN
EACH
WINDOW
USE
A
GC
WITH
THE
SUBWINDOWMODE
ATTRIBUTE
SET
TO
INCLUDEINFERIORS
THE
DEFAULT
IS
CLIPBYCHILDREN
HOWEVER
BEWARE
IF
ANY
OF
THE
CHILDREN
ARE
OF
A
DIFFERENT
DEPTH
TO
THE
PARENT
THE
SEMANTICS
OF
THIS
