RE
MIX
GL
WITH
X

IN
ARTICLE
JAY
GRAHAM
WRITES
I
AM
DEVELOPING
AN
X
XTXM
APPLICATION
THAT
WILL
INCLUDE
A
GRAPHICS
WINDOW
OF
SOME
SORT
WITH
MOVING
SYMBOLS
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
A
PURE
X
APPLICATION
COULD
BE
IMPLEMENTED
WITH
MOTIF
WIDGETS
ONE
OF
WHICH
WOULD
BE
AN
XMDRAWINGAREA
FOR
DRAWING
WITH
XLIB
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
GRAPHICS
LIBRARY
GL
AVAILABLE
ON
OUR
IBM
SGIS
GL
I
BELIEVE
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
MIX
X
AND
GL
IN
ONE
APPLICATION
PROGRAM
CAN
I
USE
GL
SUBROUTINES
IN
AN
XMDRAWINGAREA
OR
IN
AN
X
WINDOW
OPENED
BY
ME
WITH
XOPENWINDOW
THERE
IS
A
WIDGET
ALREADY
DEFINED
FOR
GL
IT
IS
THE
GLXMDRAW
MOTIF
OR
GLXDRAW
ATHENA
WIDGET
IT
IS
SIMILAR
TO
A
XMDRAWINGAREA
EXCEPT
THAT
IT
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
USE
GL
CALLS
TO
RENDER
INTO
THE
WINDOW
LOOK
AT
GLXLINK
GLXUNLINK
GLXGETCONFIG
AND
GLXWINSET
IN
THE
MAN
PAGES
I
HAVE
NEVER
USED
GL
BEFORE
BUT
THE
DOC
ON
GL
WINOPEN
SAYS
THAT
THE
FIRST
TIME
WINOPEN
IS
CALLED
IT
OPENS
A
CONNECTION
TO
THE
SERVER
ALSO
MOST
OF
THE
GL
CALLS
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
A
DISPLAY
OR
GC
UNLIKE
MOST
X
CALLS
FROM
THIS
INITIAL
INFORMATION
IT
APPEARS
THAT
X
AND
GL
CANNOT
BE
MIXED
EASILY
IS
THIS
TRUE
THE
GLXMDRAW
WIDGET
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
OPENGL
WILL
BE
AN
IMPROVEMENT
DOES
PEX
GRAPHIGS
HAVE
THE
SAME
FUNCTIONALITY
OF
GL
I
THINK
GL
IS
A
LITTLE
EASIER
TO
USE
AND
A
LITTLE
MORE
POWERFUL
BUT
THATS
JUST
AN
OPINION
MILEAGE
MAY
VARY
LARRY
D
PYEATT
THE
VIEWS
EXPRESSED
HERE
ARE
NOT
INTERNET
PYEATTTEXACOCOM
THOSE
OF
MY
EMPLOYER
OR
OF
ANYONE
VOICE
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
EXCEPTION
OF
MYSELF
