I
KNOW
THAT
THE
MWM
HAS
AN
RESOURCE
TO
SPECIFY
IF
POSITIONS
ARE
TO
BE
USED
FOR
THE
BORDER
OF
A
WINDOW
OR
FOR
THE
USER
WINDOW
MAYBE
OTHER
WINDOW
MANAGERS
HAVE
SIMILAR
OPTIONS
ANOTHER
WAY
TO
FIGURE
OUT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
USER
WINDOW
POSITION
AND
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATION
WINDOW
POSITION
IS
TO
SUBTRACT
THEIR
POSITIONS
YOU
JUST
HAVE
TO
USE
XQUERYTREE
AND
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
WINDOW
MANAGER
DECORATIONS
WINDOW
IS
THE
PARENT
OF
YOUR
WINDOW
UNFORTUNATELY
YOU
CAN
ONLY
FIGURE
OUT
THE
DECORATION
WIDTH
AND
HEIGHT
AFTER
THE
WINDOW
HAS
BEEN
MAPPED
THIS
WAY
ANOTHER
WAY
WOULD
BE
TO
USE
GETGEOMETRY
TO
FIND
OUT
WHERE
YOU
ARE
RELATIVE
TO
THE
FRAME
AND
TRANSLATECOORDINATES
TO
FIND
OUT
WHERE
YOUR
WINDOWS

CORNER
REALLY
IS
