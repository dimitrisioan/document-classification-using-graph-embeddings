OH
BOY
HAVE
I
WANTED
THIS
TOO
HOWEVER
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
CURSOR
WILL
BE
UNDER
THE
SERVERS
CONTROL
COULD
BE
WRONG
ON
AN
XTERMINAL
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
THE
SERVER
WAS
NOT
THE
ONE
CONTROLLING
THE
CURSOR
THEN
TRYING
TO
GET
THE
XTERM
APPLICATION
TO
DO
THE
BLINKING
WOULD
CAUSE
NEEDLESS
AND
YUCKY
NETWORK
OVERHEAD
CONSISTANTLY
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
WRITE
CURSOR
BLINKING
CODE
JUST
IMPLEMENT
THE
SIMPLE
CASE
A
STRAIGHT
OR
SO
ONOFF
CYCLE
HOWEVER
THE
CURSOR
WILL
WORK
MUCH
BETTER
IF
CURSOR
BLINKING
IS
SUPPRESSED
IE
THE
CURSOR
IS
MADE
VISIBLE
ANY
TIME
THE
CURSOR
MOVES
AND
FOR
TO
SEC
THEREAFTER
IF
YOU
DONT
DO
THIS
THE
CURSOR
WILL
BE
HARD
TO
TRACK
WHEN
IN
MOTION
YOU
ALLWAYS
COULD
PORT
AND
USE
EMU
FROM
EXPORTLCSMITEDUCONTRIBEMUTARZ
WEVE
IMPLEMENTED
A
BLINKING

FOR
THE
VERY
REASONS
PEOPLE
MENTIONED
YOU
CAN
EVEN
CONFIGURE

TURN

SET

AND
SO
ON
YOU
EVEN
GET

TEXT
OK
ENOUGH
ADVERTISING
I
HAVENT
LOOKED
AT
THE
XTERM
CODE
IN
THIS
RESPECT
BUT
FROM
THE
MEMORIES
I
HAVE
WHEN
WE
HAD
TO
DECIDE
WHETHER
TO
START
WITH
XTERM
AND
MAKE
IT
DO
WHAT
WE
WANTED
MOSTLY
THE
BLINKING
TEXT
ID
SAY
IT
WONT
BE
EASY
SINCE
XTERM
IS
A
HAIRY
MESS
UNDERSTANDABLE
IF
YOU
FOLLOW
ITS
ROOTS
BACK
TO
THE
ACTUAL
TASK
TO
GET
THE
CURSOR
TO
BLINK
ISNT
THAT
DIFFICULT
IF
YOU
PROVIDE
THE
RIGHT
HOOKS
AS
ANTONIO
MENTIONED
YOULL
HAVE
TO
SHOW
THE
CURSOR
DIRECTLY
AFTER
IT
HAS
MOVED
OR
PEOPLE
WILL
BECOME
CONFUSED
SINCE
ITS
A
GOOD
IDEA
TO
TAKE
THE
CURSOR
OFF
THE
SCREEN
WHEN
YOU
DO
ANYTHING
ON
SCREEN
ANYWAYS
THIS
ISNT
VERY
COMPLICATED
YOULL
JUST
HAVE
TO
START
THE
BLINK
PROCESS
WITH
THE
CURSOR
SHOWING
DIRECTLY
AFTER
ITS
MAPPED
AS
FOR
THE
PORTABILITY
OF
EMU
AND
ITS
NEWEST
VERSION
THE
ONE
ON
EXPORT
IS
STILL
THE
SAME
AS
ON
THE
CONTRIB
TAPE
WE
WANTED
TO
GET
OUT
A
NEW
RELEASE
FOR
OVER
SIX
MONTHS
NOW
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
WERE
DROWNING
IN
WORK
BUT
SINCE
THE
CHANGES
ARENT
AFFECTIONG
EMUS
BEHAVIOR
MUCH
ID
SAY
WHOEVER
WANTS
TO
TRY
EMU
SHOULDNT
WAIT
FOR
A
NEW
VERSION
AS
IS
EMU
WONT
WORK
ON
BSD
DERIVED
SYSTEMS
EG
SUNS
WITH
ANYTHING
ELSE
THAN
A

THERE
IS
A
FIX
TO
THIS
WHICH
IS
VERY
