WRITES
ACTUALLY
I
MUST
ALSO
ASK
THE
FAQS
MOST
POPULAR
REASON
WHY
GRAPHICS
DONT
SHOW
UP
DO
YOU
WAIT
FOR
AN
EXPOSE
EVENT
BEFORE
DRAWING
YOUR
RECTANGLE
SUPPOSE
YOU
HAVE
AN
IDLE
APP
WITH
A
REALIZED
AND
MAPPED
WINDOW
THAT
CONTAINS
XLIB
GRAPHICS
A
BUTTON
WIDGET
WHEN
PRESSED
WILL
CAUSE
A
NEW
ITEM
TO
BE
DRAWN
IN
THE
WINDOW
THIS
ACTION
CLEARLY
SHOULD
NOT
CALL
XCOPYAREA
OR
EQUIV
DIRECTLY
INSTEAD
IT
SHOULD
REGISTER
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
NEW
ITEM
IN
A
MEMORY
STRUCTURE
AND
LET
THE
EXPOSE
EVENT
HANDLER
TAKE
CARE
OF
RENDERING
THE
IMAGE
BECAUSE
AT
THAT
TIME
IT
IS
GUARANTEED
THAT
THE
WINDOW
IS
MAPPED
THE
PROBLEM
OF
COURSE
IS
THAT
NO
EXPOSE
EVENT
IS
GENERATED
IF
THE
WINDOW
IS
VISIBLE
AND
MAPPED
DO
YOU
KNOW
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
TICKLE
A
WINDOW
SO
THAT
THE
EXPOSE
EVENT
HANDLER
WILL
BE
INVOKED
TO
DRAW
THIS
NEW
ITEM
WHAT
DOES
THIS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
MY
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
I
PREVIOUSLY
STATED
THAT
I
DID
AN
XCOPYAREA
OF
THE
PIXMAP
TO
THE
SCREEN
JUST
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
MY
IMAGE
HAD
DATA
AND
IT
DID
THIS
IS
NOT
A
PROBLEM
WITH
EXPOSE
EVENTS
IT
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
XCOPYPLANE
NOT
WORKING
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
A
CODE
FRAGMENT
THEY
COULD
SEND
DEMONSTRATING
THAT
XCOPYPLANE
WORKS
THIS
WOULD
BE
VERY
HELPFUL
THANKS
WHAT
IT
HAS
TO
DO
WITH
YOUR
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
IS
THIS
MANY
TIMES
BEGINNING
X
USERS
HECK
EXPERIENCED
X
USERS
TOO
WRITE
SMALL
TEST
PROGRAMS
MANY
TIMES
THEY
FORGET
TO
DRAW
ONLY
IN
RESPONSE
TO
EXPOSE
EVENTS
AND
THUS
SEE
UNPREDITABLE
RESULTS
WHEREBY
SOMETIMES
THE
APPLICATIONS
GRAPHICS
SHOW
UP
AND
SOMETIMES
THEY
DONT
WERE
JUST
TRYING
TO
ELIMINATE
ALL
THE
EASY
EXPLANATIONS
FOR
WHY
YOURE
NOT
SEEING
YOUR
GRAPHICS
THAT
BEING
SAID
WHY
DONT
YOU
TRY
COPYING
DIFFERENT
PLANES
TO
YOUR
WINDOW
OTHER
THAN
TRY
TO
SEE
IT
YOU
GET
ANY
OUTPUT
SINCE
YOURE
DIPSLAYING
ONLY
A
SINGLE
PLANE
OF
YOUR
DATA
ITS
POSSIBLE
THAT
ALL
THE
PIXEL
VALUES
IN
YOUR
PIXMAP
HAVE
THE
SAME
VALUE
FOR
THAT
COLOR
