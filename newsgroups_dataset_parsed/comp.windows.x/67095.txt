xterm
problem
with
input
focus
shuffle
up
the
situation
running
a
fortran
executable
that
creats
an
xterm
an
option
in
the
menu
contained
in
the
xterm
runs
a
fortran
subroutine
that
creats
a
tektronicsmode
xterm
for
displaying
some
graphics
typing
a
ret
while
the
tektronicsmode
xterm
future
reference
to
this
will
be
tekterm
is
active
makes
the
xterm
read
future
keystrokes
but
does
not
shift
input
focus
to
the
xterm
im
basing
that
statement
on
the
fact
that
the
border
of
the
tekterm
stays
the
highlighted
color
and
that
the
tekterm
stays
on
top
of
xterm
if
what
im
describing
isnt
input
focus
let
me
know
the
xterm
can
be
brought
to
the
top
by
clicking
the
mouse
button
on
it
subsequent
selections
from
the
xterm
of
the
menu
item
that
displays
graphics
highlihts
the
border
and
displays
the
updated
graphics
but
does
not
move
the
tekterm
to
the
top
if
the
tekterm
has
been
iconized
to
conserve
screen
space
it
stays
an
icon
the
desired
behavior
one
of
two
options
whichever
of
the
windows
that
is
active
is
always
on
top
of
the
inactive
one
whenever
the
tekterm
is
inactivated
it
should
revert
to
a
icon
but
when
it
is
activated
it
should
become
a
window
on
a
higher
level
than
the
xterm
what
i
think
i
need
a
means
of
specifying
that
a
xterm
or
tekterm
will
be
at
the
highest
level
and
a
way
to
iconifyexpand
a
xterm
and
tekterm
these
commands
would
id
guess
need
to
be
in
the
fortran
or
in
the
command
that
starts
up
the
xterm
and
tekterm
other
information
all
this
is
taking
place
on
a
a
dec
dumb
xwindows
terminal
connected
to
a
vax
running
vms
and
motif
thanks
for
your
time
if
youve
got
any
words
of
wisdom
other
than
give
up
please
