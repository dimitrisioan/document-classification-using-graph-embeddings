remote
execution
of
x
programs
i
posted
this
a
few
weeks
back
but
all
i
got
back
was
an
error
message
pnews
devnull
permission
denied
yep
devnull
had
a
mode
of
arrghhh
with
renewed
interest
in
setting
the
display
variable
etc
i
thought
i
would
post
my
contribution
this
perl
script
is
my
solution
it
trys
to
be
intelligent
about
what
its
doing
so
that
you
should
be
able
to
type
rx
hostdomainetc
and
get
a
xterm
running
on
hostdomainetc
with
all
the
difficult
stuff
taken
care
of
in
theory
this
program
can
do
everything
you
ever
wanted
to
do
when
you
wanted
to
run
a
remote
command
in
the
background
it
doesnt
even
need
to
be
an
x
program
try
a
rx
bigmachine
make
for
instance
for
a
backgrounded
make
on
the
remote
bigmachine
for
more
details
and
a
full
list
of
features
read
the
readme
file
about

this
is
a
shell
archive

anything
before
this
line
then
unpack
it
by
saving
it
into
a
file
and
typing
sh
file
to
overwrite
existing
files
type
sh

c
you
can
also
feed
this
as

turn

x
x
looks

it
turned

a
perl
script
at
some
point
big
improvement
x
x
this
code
tries
to
be
intelligent
in
the
way
it
works
this
means
there
x
are
tons
of
implicit
assumptions
about
the
environment
it
is
run
in
x
these
assumptions
are
all
valid
on
the
machines
i
use
and
in
my
x
environment
at
the
same
time
i
try
to
make
as
few
assumptions
as
possible
x
about
the
remote
machine
heres
a
list
of
all
the
more
tricky
ones
x
that
the
remote
machine
has
csh
linux
x
that
rshell
binksh
remote
shell
binksh
make
same
x
if
remote
shell
sh
that
path
is
compatible
use
csh
etc
x
i
pass
a
cookie
to
the
remote
machine
if
need
be
but
does
it
x
know
what
to
do
with
a
cookie
eat
it
x
there
must
be
others
x
x
why
am
i
using
csh
to
run
the
remote
commands
simply
because
it
doesnt
x
interact
badly
with
rsh
and
hang
waiting
for
a
file
descriptor
to
x
be
closed
id
rather
use
zsh
or
bash
or
even
perl
but
they
are
not
x
as
universal
as
csh
x

change
these

a

you

yeah
we

much
