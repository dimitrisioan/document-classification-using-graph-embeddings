there

im
trying
to
compile
and
motif
on
a
hp
running
markus
hpux
but
it
seems
to
be
not
very
succesful
because
markus
i
have
only
hpcf
configfiles
for
hpux
markus
i
tried
standard
cc
and
x
was
compiled
with
a
lot
of
warnings
markus
the
motif
applications
are
compiled
quite
well
but
they
wont
run
markus
i
receive
the
xkeysymdb
error
which
is
reported
in
faq
but
markus
i
cannot
fix
it
the
xkeysymdbfile
is
at
the
right
location
and
it
markus
works
fine
under
sunos
markus
probably
i
have
started
the
compilation
prozess
only
with
a
wrong
markus
configfile
markus
please
help
me
markus
markus
thanx
in
advance

markus
if
you
installed
x
lib
xt
by
redefining
projectroot
you
will
find
that
during
the
install
it
recompiles
one
of
the
files
in
x
lib
that
does
the
search
for
xkeysmdb
and
embeds
the
search
path
for
the
file
based
on
whatever
projectroot
was
defined
to
confirm
this
what
happened
because
im
guessing
go
to
mitlibx
and
do
strings
xstrkeysymo
egrep
xkeysymdb
