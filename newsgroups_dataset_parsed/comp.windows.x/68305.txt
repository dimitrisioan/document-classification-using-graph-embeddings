HELP
HI
I
AM
RUNNING
ON
AN
IBM
AIX
AND
ON
A
SUNOS
SINCE
I
RUN
X
ON
BOTH
COLOUR
AND
BLACKWHITE
DISPLAYS
I
NEED
DIFFERENT
VALUES
FOR
THE
SAME
RESOURCE
SO
I
WANT
TO
USE
IFDEF
COLOR

MY
APPLICATION
DEFAULTS
FILES
HOWEVER
CPP
IS
ONLY
INVOKED
BY
XRDB
AND
NOT
WHEN

LOADED
ON
DEMAND
IS
THERE
A
PROPER
SOLUTION
TO
THIS
SO
FAR
THE
ONLY
PROPER
SOLUTION

TO
THINK
OF
IS
TO
CREATE
DIFFERENT
FILES
IN
MY
APPDEFAULTS
SAY
XTERM
AND
XTERMCOLOR
AND
SET
MY
XFILESEARCHPATH
TO
EITHER
HOMETN
OR
HOMETNCOLOR

NOT
ALWAYS
SEEM
TO
WORK
EG

A
REMOTE

COMMAND
WITHOUT
READING
THE
CSHRC
DOES
NOT
SET
XFILESEARCHPATH
FURTHERMORE

IN
XTERMCOLOR
