resources
and
cpp
help
hi
i
am
running
on
an
ibm
aix
and
on
a
sunos
since
i
run
x
on
both
colour
and
blackwhite
displays
i
need
different
values
for
the
same
resource
so
i
want
to
use
ifdef
color
in
my
application
defaults
files
however
cpp
is
only
invoked
by
xrdb
and
not
when
the
resources
are
loaded
on
demand
is
there
a
proper
solution
to
this
so
far
the
only
proper
solution
ive
come
to
think
of
is
to
create
different
files
in
my
appdefaults
say
xterm
and
xtermcolor
and
set
my
xfilesearchpath
to
either
hometn
or
hometncolor
but
that
does
not
always
seem
to
work
eg
executing
a
remote
shell
command
without
reading
the
cshrc
does
not
set
xfilesearchpath
furthermore
i
thought
of
using
include
xterm
in
xtermcolor
however
for
resources
in
xterm
that
i
want
to
override
in
xtermcolor
things
are
different
on
both
machines
on
a
sun
the
first
found
resource
is
used
ie
the
one
from
xterm
the
bw
one
while
on
an
the
last
found
value
is
used
ie
the
one
from
xtermcolor
what
can
i
do
about
it
i
have
one
last
question
for
the
specification
of
xfilesearchpath
i
can
use
t
n
c
and
s
t
stands
for
appdefaults
n
for
the
resource
class
but
what
do
c
and
s
stand
for
thanks
in
advance

replying
