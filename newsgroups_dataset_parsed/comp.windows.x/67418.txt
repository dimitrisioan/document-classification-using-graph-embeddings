i
have
a
problem
i
am
not
able
to
create
a
window
with
bit
planes
gave
badmatch
error
on
the
createwindow
request
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
the
manual
the
only
attribute
which
may
give
a
badmatch
is
the
colormap
if
it
belongs
to
a
wrong
visual
but
the
visual
was
correctly
matched
i
got
several
answers
the
most
complete
was
from
errol
crary
errolctvtvtekcom
i
have
just
looked
at
the
server
listings
mitserverdixwindowc
and
there
are
several
ways
in
which
you
can
get
a
badmatch
error
even
though
my
oreilly
book
only
says
borderwidth
is
nonzero
for
inputonly
if
class
inputonly
bw
depth
find
out
if
the
depth
and
visual
are
acceptable
for
this
screen
if
vmask
cwborderpixmap
cwborderpixel
class
inputonly
depth
pparentdrawabledepth
if
vmask
cwcolormap
class
inputonly
visual
ancwoptvisual
ancwoptcolormap
none
so
case
is
inputonly
which
is
not
your
case
it
seems
to
be
the
oreilly
case
case
should
not
be
the
case
since
you
got
the
visual
for
the
screen
case
looks
suspicious
you
are
giving
no
cwborder
in
the
attribute
mask
and
since
the
visual
is
not
the
parent
depth
i
would
suspect
you
need
to
supply
a
border
pixel
from
the
new
colormap
you
are
going
to
use
for
this
window
case
does
not
seem
to
be
the
problem
since
you
do
supply
the
cwcolormap
in
the
attributes
thanks
for
your
help
