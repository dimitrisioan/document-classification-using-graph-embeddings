XLOCK
I
FOUND
AN
ODDITY
WITH
OUR
SGI
INDIGO
MIPS
CHIP
WHEN
XLOCK
NOLOCK
IS
RUNNING
AND
I
AM
WORKING
REMOTELY
OR
IN
BATCH
AT
MODE
THE
RUNTIME
OF
MY
PROGRAMS
AS
TIMED
BY
USING
CLOCK
IN
THE
CODE
ITSELF
IS
SLOWER
THAN
IF
XLOCK
IS
NOT
RUNNING
NO
OTHER
PROCESSES
SEEM
TO
AFFECT
MY
RUNTIMES
YET
THIS
IS
VERY
CONSISTENT
ANY
EXPLANATIONS
REAL
OR
IMAGINED
