I
POSTED
THIS
ABOUT
TOW
WEEKS
AGO
BUT
NEVER
SAW
IT
MAKE
IT
THEN
AGAIN
IVE
HAD
SOME
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
MAIL
SYSTEM
APOLOGIES
IF
THIS
APPEARS
FOR
THE
SECOND
TIME
USUALLY
WHEN
I
START
UP
AN
APPLICATION
I
FIRST
GET
THE
WINDOW
OUTLINE
ON
MY
DISPLAY
I
THEN
HAVE
TO
CLICK
ON
THE
MOUSE
BUTTON
TO
ACTUALLY
PLACE
THE
WINDOW
ON
THE
SCREEN
YET
WHEN
I
SPECIFY
THE
GEOMETRY
OPTION
THE
WINDOW
APPEARS
RIGHT
AWAY
THE
PROPERTIES
SPECIFIED
BY
THE
GEOMETRY
ARGUMENT
THE
QUESTION
NOW
IS
HOW
CAN
I
OVERRIDE
THE
INTERMEDIARY
STEP
OF
THE
USER
HAVING
TO
SPECIFY
WINDOW
POSITION
WITH
A
MOUSECLICK
IVE
TRIED
EXPLICITLY
SETTING
WINDOW
SIZE
AND
POSITION
BUT
THAT
DID
ALTER
THE
NORMAL
PROGRAM
BEHAVIOUR
THANKS
FOR
ANY
HINTS
