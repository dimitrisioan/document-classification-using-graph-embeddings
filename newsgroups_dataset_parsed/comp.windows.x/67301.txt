HAVE
AN

HANDLER
WORKING
FOR
A
BUTTONPRESSMASK
LIKE
XTADDEVENTHANDLER
PLOTDATADISPLAY
BUTTONPRESSMASK
FALSE
SHOWMOUSEPOSITION
PLOTDATA
BUT
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
HAVE
TWO
TYPES
OF
ACTIONS
ONE
TO
OCCUR
WITH
THE
LEFT
MOUSE
THE
OTHER
THE
RIGHT

PERHAPS
ONE
WITH

LEFTBUTTONPRESSMASK
FALSE
SHOWLEFTMOUSEPOSITION
PLOTDATA
XTADDEVENTHANDLER
PLOTDATADISPLAY
