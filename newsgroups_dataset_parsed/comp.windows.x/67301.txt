how
to
mask
the
left
button
i

posting
this
for
a
friend
whose
news
service
is

pr
i
have
an
event
handler
working
for
a
buttonpressmask
like
xtaddeventhandler
plotdatadisplay
buttonpressmask
false
showmouseposition
plotdata
but
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
have
two
types
of
actions
one
to
occur
with
the
left
mouse
the
other
the
right
and
perhaps
one
with
the
middle
so
my
event
handler
would
look
more
like
xtaddeventhandler
plotdatadisplay
leftbuttonpressmask
false
showleftmouseposition
plotdata
xtaddeventhandler
plotdatadisplay
rightbuttonpressmask
false
showrightmouseposition
plotdata
however
i
dont
know
how
to
make
my
leftbuttonpressmask
there
didnt
seem
to
be
one
in
the
event
mask
lists
i
had
on
hand
although
looked
promising
my
references
also
mentioned
using
to
or
two
mask
events
can
you
use
to
and
two
masks
would
i
want
to
in
this
case
any
help
would
be
appreciated
thanks
