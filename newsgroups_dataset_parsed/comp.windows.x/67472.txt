i
use
xt
all
oreilly
has
to
say
is
is
automatically
handled
by
xt
if
i
use
xlib
ala
xnextevent
i
get
nothing
this
all
stems
from
problems
with
users
of
the
sun
keyboard
and
the
numlock
plus
various
altmetaetc
modifier
requirements
thats
not
all
it
says
the
coverage
of
modifiers
is
in
chapter
of
volume
four
or
chap
in
older
athena
editions
where
there
is
about
pages
on
how
to
specify
translations
to
capture
various
combinations
of
keys
or
buttons
the
xlib
route
uses
xlookupstring
and
there
is
a
lot
of
coverage
of
how
that
works
in
volume
one
chapter
you
should
read
this
to
understand
how
all
the
mappings
work
before
trying
to
do
anything
complicated
