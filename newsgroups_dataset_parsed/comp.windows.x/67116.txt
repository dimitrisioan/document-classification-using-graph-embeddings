re
forcing
a
window
manager
to
accept
specific
coordinates
for
a
window
try
this
after
xcreatewindow
include
display
display
window
window
xsizehints
xsizehints
xallocsizehints
xsizehintsflags
usposition
ussize
or
pposition
psize
xsizehintsx
xsizehintsy
xsizehintswidth
xsizehintsheight
xsetwmnormalhints
display
window
xsizehints
xfree
xsizehints
these
hints
tell
the
window
manager
that
the
position
and
size
of
the
window
are
specified
by
the
users
and
that
the
window
manager
should
accept
these
values
if
you
use
xsizehintsflags
pposition
psize
this
tells
the
window
manager
that
the
values
are
prefered
values
of
the
program
not
the
user
i
dont
know
a
window
manager
that
doesnt
place
the
window
like
you
prefer
if
you
specify
the
position
and
size
like
above
