A
PROBLEM
OCCURS
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
CREATE
A
WINDOW
WITH
A
VISUAL
THAT
IS
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
VISUAL
OF
THE
PARENT
WHICH
USES
THE
DEFAULT
VISUAL
WHICH
IS
IN

REFERENCE
GUIDE
FROM
O
REILLY
ONE
CAN
READ
IN
THE
SECTION
ABOUT
XCTEATEWINDOW
SOMETHING
LIKE
IN
THE
CURRENT
IMPLEMENTATION
OF
WHEN
USING
A
VISUAL
OTHER
THAN
THE
PARENTS
BE
SURE
TO
CREATE
OR
FIND
A
SUITABLE
COLOURMAP
WHICH
IS
TO
BE
USED
IN
THE
WINDOW
ATTRIBUTES
WHEN
CREATING
OR
ELSE
A
BADMATCH
OCCURS
THIS
WARNING
STRANGELY
ENOUGH
IS
ONLY
MENTIONED
IN
THE
NEWER
EDITIONS
OF
THE
GUIDES
IT
APPLIES
WITH
EQUAL
FORCE
TO
EARLIER
VERSIONS
PRESUMABLY
ONLY
RECENTLY
DID
THE
AUTHORS
DECIDE
IT
WAS
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
MENTION
THE
NECESSITY
IT
REFERS
TO
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
THERE
BUT
ITS
BEEN
IMPLICIT
IN
THE
WAY
CREATEWINDOW
REQUESTS
DEFAULT
SOME
ATTRIBUTES
OF
THE
NEW
WINDOW
HOWEVER
EVEN
IF
I
PASS
ALONG
A
SUITABLE
COLOURMAP
I
STILL
GET
A
BADMATCH

THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THE
WARNING
YOU
READ
IS
INCOMPLETE
YOU
HAVE
TO
PROVIDE
NOT
ONLY
A
COLORMAP
BUT
ALSO
A
BORDER
THE
DEFAULT
BORDER
IS
COPYFROMPARENT
WHICH
IS
NOT
VALID
WHEN
THE
WINDOWS

DOESNT
MATCH
ITS
PARENTS
SPECIFY
A
BORDERPIXMAP
OF
THE
CORRECT
DEPTH
OR
A
BORDERPIXEL
AND
THE
PROBLEM
SHOULD
GO
AWAY
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
PROBLEM
I
CANT
FIND
ANYTHING
TO
INDICATE
THAT
COPYFROMPARENT
MAKES
ANY
SENSE
AS
THE
BORDERWIDTH
PARAMETER
TO
XCREATEWINDOW
YOUR
XLIB
IMPLEMENTATION
PROBABLY
DEFINES
COPYFROMPARENT
AS
ZERO
TO
SIMPLIFY
THE
CONVERSION
TO
WIRE

SO
YOU
ARE
UNWITTINGLY
ASKING
FOR
A
BORDER
WIDTH
OF
ZERO
DUE
TO
THE
XLIB
IMPLEMENTATION
NOT
PROVIDING
STRICTER
TYPECHECKING
