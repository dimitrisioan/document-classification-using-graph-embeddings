HI
I
WONDER
IF
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
FOR
A
PARENT
WINDOW
TO
PAINT
OVER
THE
AREA
OF
ITS
CHILDS
IF
IT
IS
NOT
THEN
HOW
COULD
IT
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
IMPLEMENT
A
RUBBERBAND
ACROSS
MULTIPLE
XWINDOWS
TO
SELECT
THE
OBJECTS
THAT
ARE
DISPLAYED
ONE
IN
EACH
WINDOW
HAUKE
IF
YOU
SPECIFY
THE
ROOTWINDOW
WHEN
YOU
ARE
CREATING
YOUR
GC
YOU
MAY
USE
XLIB
TO
DRAW
OVER
MULTIPLE

I
HAVE
