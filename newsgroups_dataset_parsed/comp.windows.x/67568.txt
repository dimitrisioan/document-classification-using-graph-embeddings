the
author
of
xv
hes
on
vacation
till
may
or
i
dont
remember
maybe
we
all
should
slow
down
and
wait
to
hear
his
side
wrt
copyrights
fees
etc
while
i
have
respect
for
johns
ability
and
integrity
i
really
regret
his
leaving
just
after
a
major
release
or
more
accurately
making
the
release
just
before
leaving
several
of
us
are
having
problems
with
and
in
particular
i
have
issues
with
all
the
fixes
that
have
so
far
been
made
to
the
imakefiles
and
xvh
without
john
to
adjudicate
and
everybody
posting
fixes
that
work
for
them
chaos
is
inevitable
lets
hope
it
is
temporary
