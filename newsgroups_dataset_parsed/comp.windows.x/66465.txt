widgets
vs
gadgets
ive
been
using
the
xmgraph
widget
thats
been
floating
around
and
i
noticed
the
performance
is
significantly
better
using
gadgets
perhaps
even
faster
i
had
heard
in
an
old
programming
course
that
gadgets
were
no
longer
any
benefit
to
performance
and
that
its
just
as
well
to
use
widgets
everywhere
interesting
id
like
to
know
why
but
try
it
again
on
a
single
ethernet
with
x
terminals
on
it
and
i
think
youll
find
it
much
slower
adrian
nye
oreilly
and
associates
