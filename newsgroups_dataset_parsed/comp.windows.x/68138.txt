METHODS

THIS
ALSO
INCLUDES
THE

THE

SET

THIS

IS
ALSO
USED
BY

MY

USES
A
VARIATION
HOWEVER
I
WRAP
IT
AS
PART
OF

INCLUDED
IN
THIS

IS
THE
USE
OF

XRSH
TO
DO
THIS
JOB
FOR
YOU
THESE

USALLY
THE
NEWER
ONES
THAT
IS
ALLOW
YOU
TO
PASS
A
SECIFIED
LIST
OF
ENVIRONMENT

WHICH
INCLUDES
THE

ANDOR
A
COPY
OF
THE
AUTHORIZATION
CODE

THE

PROGRAM
AVAILABLE
IF
ENABLED
ON

WILL
ALSO
PASS
ENVIRONMENT

AS
WELL
AS
THE

YOU
WILL
HOWEVER
BE
REQUIRED
TO
STORE
THE
AUTHORITY
IN
SUCH
A

FOR

UNLESS
YOU

THE
RECOMMENDED
METHOD
AS
GIVEN
IN

SHOWN

IS
SAFE
FROM

WRAP
IT

THIS
METHOD
USES
THE
FACT
THAT
MOST
REMOTE
COMMAND
EXECUTORS
DO
PASS
THE

TO
THE

IT
IS
THEN
A
MATTER
OF
AN

SCRIPT
IN
YOUR

TO
EXTRACT
THE

FROM
THE

APPROPIATLY
A

BEFORE
THE

IS
PERFORMED
TO

YOU

METHOD
THAT

OF

MUST
NOT
BE
SHARED

KNOWN
BY

NOR
SHOULD
IT
BE

A

IS
TO
