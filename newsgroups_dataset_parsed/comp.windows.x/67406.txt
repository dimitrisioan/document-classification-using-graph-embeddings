hi
netters
ive
just
built
pl
under
solaris
ive
used
the
multiscreen
patch
as
well
as
the
patch
and
everything
builds
great
except
for
that
error
message
xsun
gives
me
upon
startup
it
says
cannot
set
default
font
path
stuff
deleted
and
cannot
set
default
font
fixed
if
i
supply
the
fp
option
it
doesnt
complain
about
the
font
path
but
still
complains
about
the
font
i
have
symlinks
from
usrlib
to
the
place
where
my
distribution
lives
try
to
run
xsun
under
the
best
way
to
do
this
is
by
logging
in
over
the
network
and
typing
truss
t
open
xsun

this
will
give
you
and
idea
of
where
xsun
things
the
fonts
should
be
if
you
have
defined
a
project
root
and
done
a
make
install
everything
should
have
gone
right
by
default
even
without
symbolic
links
