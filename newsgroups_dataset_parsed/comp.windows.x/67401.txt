GERMAN
KEYBOARD
ALTGR
HI
PPL
I
AM
RUNNING
UNDER
LINUX
AND
AM
TRYING
TO
GET
THE
GERMAN
KEYBOARD
WORKING
I
HAVE
ALREADY
RECOMPILED
MY
KERNEL
AND
THE
GERMAN
KEYBOARD
IN
THE
TEXTMODE
WORKS
JUST
FINE
I
HAVE
FOUND
OUT
THAT
THERE
IS
A
PRECONFIGURED
GERMAN
KEYMAP
FOR
X
CALLED
XMODMAPGR
IN
SO
I
RAN
XMODMAP
MY
FIRST
IMPRESSION
WAS
VERY
GOOD
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
Z
AND
Y
STRAIGHT
THERES
STILL
A
LITTLE
PROBLEM
I
CANT
SOLVE
HOWEVER
I
CANNOT
GET
AT
THE
BACKSLASH
BAR
BRACKETS
AND
CURLY
BRACKETS
THE
ALTGR
KEY
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
WORK
I
TRIED
XEV
TO
FIND
OUT
WHETHER
IT
PRODUCES
AN
EVENT
AT
ALL
AND
IT
DOES
LOOKING
UP
ITS
KEYCODE
IN
THE
XMODMAP
I
FOUND
THE
ENTRY
MODESWITCH
WHICH
DOESNT
RING
ANY
BELL
THE
ENTRIES
FOR
THE
KEYS
I
CANNOT
USE
SEEM
TO
BE
CORRECT
EXAMPLE
KEYCODE
XX
SSHARP
QUESTN
BACKSLASH
THE
FIRST
ENTRIES
I
CAN
EVEN
GET
AT
THE
FIRST
ONE
IS
THE
UNMODIFIED
KEY
AND
THE
SECOND
IS
THE
KEY
WITH
SHIFT
BUT
WHAT
IS
THE
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
THE
KEY
WITH
ALTGR
BUT
IT
ISNT
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
RUN
INTO
SIMILAR
PROBLEMS
AND
KNOWS
HOW
TO
SOLVE
THEM
HELP
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
CU
ALARIC
