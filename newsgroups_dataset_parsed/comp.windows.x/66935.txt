i
use
emacs
and
i
want
to
customize
my
keyboard
better
when
i
set
up
stuff
in
my
emacs
with
a
keymap
and
definekeys
i
can
only
access
certain
of
the
keys
on
my
xterminals
keyboard
i
cant
get
eg
home
end
pgup
pgdn
they
all
seem
to
have
either
the
same
or
no
keycode
i
have
a
feeling
this
cant
be
fixed
in
emacs
itself
but
that
i
need
to
do
some
xmodmap
stuff
can
someone
help
me
it
is
actually
worse
than
you
think
i
have
the
same
problem
and
have
given
up
emacs
has
an
internal
table
somewhere
which
defines
what
keys
it
will
accept
and
this
table
is
systemdependent
i
use
a
sun
from
my
hp
and
cannot
get
shift
pageup
to
work
xmodmap
is
not
sufficient
or
at
least
i
havent
worked
out
how
to
make
it
work
however
i
can
get
ordinary
pageup
and
shift
cursorright
to
work
and
i
do
some
customised
things
with
them
note
that
the
emacs
on
my
hp
has
no
problem
and
i
am
using
exactly
the
same
xmodmap
and
emacs
configuration
