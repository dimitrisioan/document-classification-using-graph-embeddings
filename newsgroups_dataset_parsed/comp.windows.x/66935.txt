WRITES
I
USE
EMACS
AND
I
WANT
TO
CUSTOMIZE
MY
KEYBOARD
BETTER
WHEN
I
SET
UP
STUFF
IN
MY
EMACS
WITH
A
KEYMAP
AND
DEFINEKEYS
I
CAN
ONLY
ACCESS
CERTAIN
OF
THE
KEYS
ON
MY
XTERMINALS
KEYBOARD
I
CANT
GET
EG
HOME
END
PGUP
PGDN
THEY
ALL
SEEM
TO
HAVE
EITHER
THE
SAME
OR
NO
KEYCODE
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THIS
CANT
BE
FIXED
IN
EMACS
ITSELF
BUT
THAT
I
NEED
TO
DO
SOME
XMODMAP
STUFF
CAN
SOMEONE
HELP
ME
IT
IS
ACTUALLY
WORSE
THAN
YOU
THINK
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
AND
HAVE
GIVEN
UP
EMACS
HAS
AN
INTERNAL
TABLE
SOMEWHERE
WHICH
DEFINES
WHAT
KEYS
IT
WILL
ACCEPT
AND
THIS
TABLE
IS
SYSTEMDEPENDENT
I
USE
A
SUN
FROM
MY
HP
AND
CANNOT
GET
SHIFT
PAGEUP
TO
WORK
XMODMAP
IS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
OR
AT
LEAST
I
HAVENT
WORKED
OUT
HOW
TO
MAKE
IT
WORK
HOWEVER
I
CAN
GET
ORDINARY
PAGEUP
AND
SHIFT
CURSORRIGHT
TO
WORK
AND
I
DO
SOME
CUSTOMISED
THINGS
WITH
THEM
NOTE
THAT
THE
EMACS
ON
MY
HP
HAS
NO
PROBLEM
AND
I
AM
USING
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
XMODMAP
AND
EMACS
CONFIGURATION
