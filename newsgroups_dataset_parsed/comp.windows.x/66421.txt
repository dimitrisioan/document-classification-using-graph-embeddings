in
my
opinion
a
programming
degree
is
still
worth
having
yes
but
a
cs
degree
is
not
a
programming
degree
does
anybody
know
of
a
computing
course
where
programming
is
taught
computer
science
is
a
branch
of
maths
or
the
course
i
did
was
ive
also
done
a
software
engineering
course
much
more
practical
and
likely
to
be
the
sort
of
thing
an
employer
really
wants
rather
than
what
they
think
they
want
but
also
did
not
teach
programming
the
ability
to
program
was
an
entry
requirement
at
robert
gordon
university
programming
was
the
main
most
timeconsuming
start
of
the
course
the
first
two
years
consisted
of
five
subjects
software
engineering
pascalcunix
computer
engineering
assembler
computer
theory
lispprolog
mathematicsstatistics
and
communication
skills
how
to
pass
interviewsintelligence
tests
and
group
discussions
eg
how
to
survive
a
helicopter
crash
in
the
north
sea
the
third
year
industrial
placement
was
spent
working
for
a
computer
company
for
a
year
the
company
could
be
anywhere
in
europe
there
was
a
special
travel
allowance
scheme
to
cover
the
visiting
costs
of
professors
the
fourth
year
included
operating
software
engineering
assembler
real
time
laboratory
assembler
and
computing
theory
lisp
there
were
also
group
projects
in
and
years
where
students
worked
in
teams
to
select
their
own
project
or
decide
to
work
for
an
outside
company
the
only
disadvantage
being
that
specifications
would
change
suddenly
in
the
first
four
years
there
was
a
weighting
between
courseworks
and
exams
for
most
subjects
however
in
the
honours
year
this
was
reduced
to
a
split
between
an
individual
project
and
final
exams
no
coursework
assessment
are
all
computer
science
courses
like
this
btw
we
started
off
with
students
in
our
first
year
and
were
left
with
by
honours
year
also
every
course
is
tutored
separately
not
easy
trying
to
sleep
when
you
are
in
student
class
