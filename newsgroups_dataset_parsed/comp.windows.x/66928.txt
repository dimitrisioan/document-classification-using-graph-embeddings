ports
of
motif
to
both
and
linux
are
available
for
a
fee
of
about
this
is
cost
recovery
for
the
person
who
bought
the
rights
to
redistribute
the
activity
in
both
the
bsd
and
linux
news
groups
pertaining
to
motif
has
been
high
i
just
wonder
if
this
will
also
cause
a
divergence
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
software
ie
you
will
only
get
free
software
using
athena
or
openlook
widget
sets
and
only
get
commercial
software
using
the
motif
widget
sets
i
cant
see
why
if
just
about
every
workstation
will
come
with
motif
by
default
and
you
can
buy
it
for
under
for
the
free
unix
platforms
i
cant
see
this
causing
major
problems
let
me
add
another
of
my
concerns
yes
i
can
buy
a
port
of
motif
for
cheap
but
i
cannot
get
the
source
for
cheap
hence
i
am
limited
to
using
whatever
x
libraries
the
motif
port
was
compiled
against
at
least
with
older
versions
of
motif
i
have
been
told
that
motif
can
be
used
with
any
x
but
i
have
not
seen
it
myself
currently
i
have
running
on
eight
different
unix
platforms
of
which
only
three
came
with
motif
on
those
three
i
am
unable
to
use
the
libraries
to
build
motif
clients
because
i
get
link
errors
between
the
vendorsupplied
port
of
motif
and
my
i
anticipate
having
this
same
problem
when
becomes
available
the
result
is
that
i
cannot
build
motif
clients
that
rely
on
since
i
do
not
have
motif
compiled
under
true
i
could
buy
another
port
of
motif
but
that
sort
of
ruins
the
whole
idea
of
free
doesnt
it
