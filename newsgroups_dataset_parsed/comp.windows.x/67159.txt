can
some
one
please
explain
to
me
why
the
following
piece
of
code
causes
twm
or
tvtwm
to
dump
core
in
particular
i
am
interested
in
knowing
whether
this
behavior
is
caused
by
a
bug
in
my
reasoning
or
if
it
is
a
bug
in
twm
if
anything
a
client
does
causes
twm
to
dump
core
its
a
bug
in
twm
window
managers
should
never
ever
crash
would
if
only
it
were
true
if
only
mit
would
fix
the
twm
installwindowcolormaps
crash
bug
once
and
for
all
then
i
could
say
that
ive
almost
unable
to
crash
either
twm
or
tvtwm
which
would
be
a
remarkable
feat
and
most
desirable
to
boot
i
mean
this
bug
has
only
been
reported
oh
a
zillion
times
by
now
now
servers
on
the
other

to
