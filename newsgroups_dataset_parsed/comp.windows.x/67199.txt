WIDGET
TRANSLATION
PROBLEM
I
AM
WRITING
A
CUSTOM
WIDGET
TO
SUPPORT
THE
DISPLAY
OF
GRAPHICS
AND
IMAGERY
THE
USER
OF
THE
WIDGET
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
SPECIFY
WHEN
CREATING
IT
WHETHER
IT
IS
TO
OPERATE
IN
X
OR
GL
MODE
I
HAVE
SET
UP
TRANSLATIONS
AND
ACTIONS
TO
HANDLE
MOUSE
BUTTON
PRESSES
THEY
WORK
FINE
WHEN
THE
WIDGET
IS
IN
X
MODE
IN
GL
MODE
THEY
ONLY
WORK
WHEN
THE
WIDGET
MY
GLX
WIDGET
IS
A
CHILD
OF
A
MANAGER
PUT
ANOTHER
WAY
THE
TRANSLATIONS
DO
NOT
WORK
WHEN
THE
WIDGET
IS
CONFIGURED
IN
GL
MODE
AND
IS
A
CHILD
OF
A
SHELL
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHY
THIS
IS
HAPPENING
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
