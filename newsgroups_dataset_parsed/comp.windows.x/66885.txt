compiling
clients
on
a
sun
ipx
im
trying
to
set
up
an
ipx
for
another
group
i
copied
all
the
x
stuff
that
i
compiled
on
my
which
runs
sunos
using
gcc
and
most
things
run
just
fine
however
i
did
find
a
couple
of
bugs
and
when
i
try
to
recompile
those
clients
on
the
ipx
which
runs
i
get
ld
undefined
symbol
xshapequeryextension
xshapecombinemask
i
know
that
i
can
include
libxext
and
get
rid
of
those
messages
but
i
cant
figure
out
why
i
get
them
on
the
ipx
and
not
on
the
any
ideas
