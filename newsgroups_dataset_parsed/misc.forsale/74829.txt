its
an
experiment
place
a
not
so
subliminal
slightly
cagey
message
in
front
of
a
viewer
and
see
how
long
it
takes
to
create
a
response
and
what
was
the
response
it
was
the
same
thing
with
the
blow
me
message
only
it
had
a
quicker
response
timeand
some
unexpected
responses
along
with
the
expectedly
negative
ones
anyone
see
how
long
that
took
yours
