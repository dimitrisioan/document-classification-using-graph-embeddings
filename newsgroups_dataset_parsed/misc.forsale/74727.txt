WRITES
HAVE
YOU
HEAD
OF
SMALL
CLAIMS
YOU
MAY
HAVE
TO
PUT
MONEY
UP
FRONT
FOR
THE
FILING
FEES
AND
THEN
POSSIBLY
HAVING
THE
LOCAL
SHERIFF
OF
HISHER
CITY
TO
DELIVER
THE
BAD
NEWS
IN
THE
END
THE
OTHER
PARTY
WILL
END
UP
PAYING
FOR
HISHER
MISTAKE
WITH
INTEREST
FROM
THE
TIME
OF
THE
FILING
TO
THE
PAY
DATE
OF
THE
DEFENDENT
I
THINK
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
SMALL
CLAIMS
COURT
IS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
TO
THE
LOCATION
OF
THE
PERSON
YOURE
TAKING
ACTION
AGAINST
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THE
TIME
AND
MONEY
INVOLVED
IN
TRAVELLING
OUT
THERE
UNLESS
THIS
PERSON
IS
CLOSE
TO
YOU
WOULDNT
BE
WORTH
IT
FOR
A
SMALL
CLAIM
IT
REALLY
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
MUCH
MONEY
YOURE
OUT
IF
I
AM
WRONG
ABOUT
ANY
OF
THIS
SOMEONE
PLEASE
CORRECT
ME
