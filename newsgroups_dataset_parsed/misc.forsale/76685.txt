tapes
and
serial
cables
its
basement
cleaning
time
this
stuff
has
got
to
go
i
have
two
boxes
of
track
tapes
around
tapesbox
they
are
free
to
anyone
who
wants
to
come
by
and
pick
them
up
theyve
seen
very
little
use
if
anyone
wants
these
bad
enough
to
ship
theyre
yours
for
the
cost
of
shipping
the
cod
charge
and
a
nusiance
fee
i
have
a
lot
of
serial
cables
i
have
all
kinds
ribbon
shielded
long
short
mm
mf
whatever
you
want
most
appear
to
work
well
with
pc
serial
ports
but
i
will
not
gaurantee
that
tell
me
what
you
want
and
ill
do
the
best
i
can
to
match
ea
or
shipping
included
no
cods
under
you
want
to
pay
a
cod
charge
for
a
cable
go
buy
the
cable
at
your
local
computer
store
instead
itll
be
cheaper
i
believe
these
cables
were
removed
from
service
at
a
computer
center
they
appear
to
be
in
good
condition
and
the
ones
i
have
used
have
worked
well
i
also
have
a
kva
exide
ups
with
batteries
that
needs
minor
repair
probably
a
logic
board
it
weighs
about
pounds
and
is
inches
high
i
think
they
used
to
run
a
prime
system
off
of
it
best
offer
over
but
you
need
to
come
pick
it
up
use
this
to
run
your
house
from
your
solar
panels
i
will
consider
reasonable
offers
on
any
of
this
stuff
