these
games
require
a
sony

player
the
nice
thing
about
this
player
is
that
you
can
also
watch
normal
laserdisc
movies
on
it
as
well
i
have
one
which
i
will
sell
for
by
itself
with
a
purchase
of
one
complete
system
or
if
you
buy
both
systems
i
currently
run
this
into
my
entertainment
center
i
have
it
housed
in
a
pc
computer
case
with
with
its
own
fan
and
power
supply
i
run
the
audio
into
my
stereo
system
and
the
laserdisc
runs
directly
into
the
tv
i
have
made
a
mount
for
the
joysticks
and
the
buttons
first
person
who
buys
both
games
will
get
it
all
otherwise
you
have
to
do
it
yourself
if
you
would
prefer
to
have
it
all
housed
in
a
normal
arcade
cabinet
this
can
be
done
as
well
the
graphics
will
go
nicely
along
the
sides
and
front
of
the
cabinet
everything
works
perfectly
the
laserdisc
player
has
an
port
which
you
can
use
to
develop
your
own
multimedia
type
applications
