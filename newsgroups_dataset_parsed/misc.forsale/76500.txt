LOOKING
FOR
MIKE
DAMICO
I
RECENTLY
PURCHASED
AN
IBM
MONOCHROME
VGA
MONITOR
FROM
MIKE
DAMICO
THE
MONITOR
ARRIVED
BUT
IT
WAS
MISSING
ITS
POWER
CABLE
MIKES
ADDRESS
IS
APPARENTLY
NOT
A
PROPER
ADDRESS
BECAUSE
MAIL
CANT
REACH
IT
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
HOW
TO
CONTACT
MIKE
AND
COULD
HELP
ME
FIND
HIM
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
IT
I
AM
SURE
HE
JUST
SET
ASIDE
THE
POWER
CORD
AS
HE
WAS
PACKING
THE
MONITOR
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
LOT
MORE
USEFUL
TO
ME
IF
I
HAD
THE
CORD
AS
WELL
TRACI
