ITS
A
CHEAP
TRICK

JUNK
MAIL
FLOW
IS
ANY
INDICATION
I
HAVE
A

OF
THIS
CATALOG
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
AS
I
WRITE
THIS
IT
DOES
HAVE
TONS
OF
QOOL
STUFF
IN
IT
MY
IMPRESSION
IS
THAT
THEY
TRY
NOT
TO
SEND
IT
OUT
TO
BROWSERS
IT
APPEARS
THAT
IF
YOUR
NOT
A
BUYER
OR
AN
ENGINEER
THEY
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
WASTE
A
CATALOG
ON
YOU
WHEN
YOU
GET
A

THERES
A
VIP

YOU
HAVE
TO
GIVE
THEM
TO
ENSURE
YOUR
CONTINUED
SUBSCRIPTION

IN
ANY
WAY
IN
FACT
I
HAVE
NEVER
ORDERED

SO
I
CANT
