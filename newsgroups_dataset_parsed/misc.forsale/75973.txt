if
you
would
like
a
free
copy
reply
with
your
u
s
postal
mailing
address
i
am
very
interested
in
your
catalog
but
email
to
you
bounces
dont
bother
it
never
comes
its
a
cheap
trick
for
building
a
mailing
list
to
sell
if
my
junk
mail
flow
is
any
indication
i
have
a
copy
of
this
catalog
in
front
of
me
as
i
write
this
it
does
have
tons
of
qool
stuff
in
it
my
impression
is
that
they
try
not
to
send
it
out
to
browsers
it
appears
that
if
your
not
a
buyer
or
an
engineer
they
do
not
want
to
waste
a
catalog
on
you
when
you
get
a
catalog
theres
a
vip
code
you
have
to
give
them
to
ensure
your
continued
subscription
anyway
if
you
want
to
get
in
touch
with
them
the
company
is
personal
computing
tools
division
street
campbell
ca
they
also
have
fax
s
and
toll
free
s
for
ordering
and
tech
support
please
note
that
i
am
not
associated
with
them
in
any
way
in
fact
i
have
never
ordered
from
them
so
i
cant
comment
on
their
products
or
service
but
the
catalog
is
real
and
i
am
sitting
here
salivating
over
it
