WRITES
I
HAD
THE
FRONT
PANEL
OF
MY
CAR
STEREO
STOLEN
THIS
WEEKEND
I
NEED
TO
BUY
THE
FRONT
PANEL
OF
A
SONY
CAR
STEREO
I
WAS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THOSE
REMOVEABLEFRONTPANELS
WERE
TO
MAKE
THE
RADIO
USELESS
AND
THUS
DISCOURAGE
THEFT
THAT
IS
IF
THE
COVER
WERE
REMOVED
BY
THE
OWNER
AND
TAKEN
ALONG
WHENEVER
THE
CAR
WAS
LEFT
IF
THOSE
COVERS
WERE
SOLD
FOR
ANYTHING
REMARKABLY
LESS
THAN
THE
RADIO
ORIGINALLY
COSTS
OR
EVEN
SOLD
AT
ALL
THEN
THE
ABOVE
DISCOURAGEMENT
WOULDNT
BE
SO
GREAT
I
PERSONALLY
WOULD
BE
UNHAPPY
IF
I
BOUGHT
A
RADIO
LIKE
THAT
THINKING
THAT
REMOVING
THE
COVER
GREATLY
DEPRECIATED
THE
RADIOS
VALUE
AND
THE
COVERS
WERE
SOLD
BY
THE
COMPANY
OR
OTHER
LEGITIMATE
SOURCE
CHEAPLY
THE
FRONT
COVERS
SHOULD
BE
AVAILABLE
FROM
SONY
CHECK
WITH
A
LOCAL
CAR
STEREO
SHOP
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
DEFINITELY
HAVE
TO
PROVIDE
THE
UNITS
SERIAL
NUMBER
AND
HOPEFULLY
YOU
HAD
REGISTERED
THE
WARRANTY
CARD
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
COST
BUT
REPLACEMENTS
HAVE
TO
BE
AVAILABLE
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
DAMAGE
THE
FACE
COVER
SO
IT
STANDS
TO
REASON
THAT
IT
CAN
BE
REPLACED
AS
TO
DETERRING
THEFT
WHEN
I
WORKED
FOR
A
STEREO
SHOP
WE
REFERRED
THE
CUSTOMER
TO
A
SONY
NUMBER
WE
WOULD
NOT
SELL
THE
FACE
NOR
DID
WE
HAVE
THEM
AVAILABLE
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
CAME
IN
ASKING
FOR
THE
FACE
COVER
OR
A
PULLOUT
SLEAVE
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WOULD
LOOK
VERY
DISHEARTENED
TO
FIND
THAT
THEY
ACQUIRED
A
DECK
THEY
COULDNT
USE
IF
THEFT
OCCURS
WITH
THESE
DECKS
NOTIFY
SONY
SERIAL
NUMBERS
DO
CATCH
THEIVES
JUST
A
THOUGHT
