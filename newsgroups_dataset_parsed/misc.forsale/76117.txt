model
i
bought
the
radar
detector
a
couple
years
ago
for
obvious
reasons
and
i
have
never
been
ticketed
for
the
past
years
and
now
i
dont
drive
to
work
anymore
so
i
would
rather
sell
it
u
whristler
radar
detector
working
x
k
bands
if
you
would
like
to
buy
any
of
the
above
items
please
mail
me
at
jackacsbuedu

price
is

if
you
think
the
prices
i
listed
above
is
unrealistic
please
mail
me
back
and
i
would
take
your
advice
into
consideration
and
make
the
proper
adjustments
the
reason
i
am
selling
this
stuff
is
because
i
have
decided
that
i
had
enough
with
this
hobby
of
pc
computing
and
i
want
to
move
on
other
interests
one
last
thing
if
you
know
any
nonprofit
organization
whom
might
be
interested
in
my
equipments
please
let
me
know
because
if
no
one
wants
to
buy
them
i
might
as
well
donate
them
and
get
a
tax
break
thanks
