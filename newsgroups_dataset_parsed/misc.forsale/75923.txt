matches
case
all
original
manuals
and
documentation
video
drivers
etc
are
included
you
are
probably
wondering
why
i
must
sell
the
case
with
the
motherboard
it
is
simply
because
the
case
is
custommade
for
this
particular
board
and
you
would
be
hardpressed
to
fit
another
mb
in
it
however
the
case
and
this
motherboard
were
made
to
go
together
and
fit
perfectly
as
you
can
see
since
this
board
includes
drive
controllers
and
a
video
controller
you
can
save
some
money
by
buying
this
unit
and
not
a
mb
where
you
would
need
to
get
io
cards
video
card
and
drive
controllers
its
just
a
lot
more
convenient
on
the
whole
i
would
like
to
ask
about
for
this
whole
package
i
think
this
is
a
fair
price
given
the
facts
that
it
includes
a
video
card
and
drive
controllersio
ports
all
you
need
to
do
is
add
drives
a
monitor
ram
and
a
keyboard
also
keep
in
mind
that
it
isnt
a
generic
board
but
from
compuadd
i
also
will
entertain
all
serious
offers
please
email
at
jmuacpubdukeedu
thanks
