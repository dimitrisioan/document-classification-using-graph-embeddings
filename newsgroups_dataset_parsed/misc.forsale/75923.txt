YOU

PROBABLY
WONDERING
WHY
I
MUST
SELL
THE

IT
IS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE

PARTICULAR

YOU
WOULD
BE
HARDPRESSED
TO
FIT
ANOTHER
MB
IN
IT
HOWEVER
THE

MADE

GO

ITS
JUST
A
LOT
MORE
CONVENIENT
ON

WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
ABOUT
FOR
THIS
WHOLE
PACKAGE
I
THINK
THIS

A
FAIR
PRICE
GIVEN
THE
FACTS
THAT
IT
INCLUDES
A
VIDEO
CARD
AND
DRIVE
CONTROLLERSIO
PORTS
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
IS
ADD
DRIVES
A
MONITOR
RAM
AND
A
KEYBOARD
ALSO
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
IT
ISNT
A
GENERIC
BOARD
BUT

ALSO

ENTERTAIN
ALL
SERIOUS
OFFERS
