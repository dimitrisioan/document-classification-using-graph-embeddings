RE
CAR
STEREO
STOLEN
I
HAD
THE
FRONT
PANEL
OF
MY
CAR
STEREO
STOLEN
THIS
WEEKEND
I
NEED
TO
BUY
THE
FRONT
PANEL
OF
A
SONY
CAR
STEREO
IF
BY
ANY
CHANCE
ANYONE
HAS
HAD
THE
BODY
OF
A
SONY
STOLEN
AND
HAS
AN
OTHERWISE
USELESS
FRONT
PANEL
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
BUY
IT
FROM
YOU
IF
YOU
KNOW
ANYONE
WHO
HAD
A
REMOVEABLEFRONTPANEL
CAR
STEREO
STOLEN
FROM
THEM
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
FORWARD
THIS
MESSAGE
TO
THEM
THANKS
KRIS
I
WAS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
PURPOSE
OF
THOSE
REMOVEABLEFRONTPANELS
WERE
TO
MAKE
THE
RADIO
USELESS
AND
THUS
DISCOURAGE
THEFT
THAT
IS
IF
THE
COVER
WERE
REMOVED
BY
THE
OWNER
AND
TAKEN
ALONG
WHENEVER
THE
CAR
WAS
LEFT
IF
THOSE
COVERS
WERE
SOLD
FOR
ANYTHING
REMARKABLY
LESS
THAN
THE
RADIO
ORIGINALLY
COSTS
OR
EVEN
SOLD
AT
ALL
THEN
THE
ABOVE
DISCOURAGEMENT
WOULDNT
BE
SO
GREAT
I
PERSONALLY
WOULD
BE
UNHAPPY
IF
I
BOUGHT
A
RADIO
LIKE
THAT
THINKING
THAT
REMOVING
THE
COVER
GREATLY
DEPRECIATED
THE
RADIOS
VALUE
AND
THE
COVERS
WERE
SOLD
BY
THE
COMPANY
OR
OTHER
LEGITIMATE
SOURCE
CHEAPLY
YOU
CUT
HERE
YOUD
RUIN
YOUR
KENNETH

RAY
EXPERT

WHO
KNOWS
MORE
AND
MORE
CRC
OCIS
ABOUT
LESS

LESS
AND
FINALLY
RICE
UNIVERSITY
KNOWS
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
NOTHING
