ON
THE
THIS
HAS
BEEN
THE
MAIN
MIDI
CONTROLLER
IN
MY
STUDIO
FOR
QUITE
A
WHILE
NOW
IT
HAS
PERFORMED
ABLY
IN
THAT
ROLE
AND
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
A
HEAVILY
USED
SOUND
SOURCE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
DESIGNED
WITH
THIS
ROLE
IN
MIND
AND
IT
WORKS
VERY
WELL
WITH
MY
SOFTWARE
SEQUENCER
WINCAKE
IN
ITS
MULTITIMBRAL
MODE
FROM
A
SYNTHESIS
POINT
OF
VIEW
THIS
MACHINE
IS
A
HYBRID
IT
USES
LOOPED
SHORT

THERE
ARE
OF
THEM
AS

THEN
THESE
WAVES
ARE
PROCESSED
WITH
A
SOPHISTICATED
DCFDCA
ARRANGEMENT
THE
IS
CAPABLE
OF
GREAT
THINGS
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
ANALOG
LOWPASS
FILTER
SIMPLY
PUT
IT
MAKES
FABULOUS
ANALOG
SYNTH
SOUNDS
BUT
UNLIKE
MOST
GOOD
ANALOG
SYNTHS
IT
HAS
A
VERY
THOROUGH
MIDI
IMPLEMENTATION
SO
THAT
IT
WORKS
VERY
WELL
WITH
A
MIDI
SEQUENCER
WHAT
I
REALLY
LIKE
MOST
ABOUT
THIS
THING
IS
THAT
IT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
MAKING
A
VERY
WIDE
RANGE
OF
SOUNDS
THIS
IS
ABOUT
YEARS
OLD
MFG
DATE
IT
DOES
HAVE
AN
SEQUENCER
BUT
LIKE
MOST
ONBOARD
SEQUENCERS
IT
IS
A
PAIN
TO
USE
SO
I
HAVE
AVOIDED
IT
REASON
FOR
SALE
I
AM
SELLING
MY

I
RECENTLY
JOINED
FORCES
WITH
ANOTHER
INDIVIDUAL
HERE
IN

AND
WE
HAVE
MORE
KEYBOARDS
THAN
SPACE
TO

I
RECOMMEND

SOMEONE
WHO
IS
GETTING
