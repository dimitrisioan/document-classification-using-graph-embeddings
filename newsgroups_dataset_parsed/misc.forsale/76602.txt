SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
CONNER
MODEL
I
BOUGHT
THIS
FROM
A
GUY
AT
A
SWAP
MEET
TO
USE
WITH
MY
MACINTOSH
UNFORTUNATELY
I
CANT
SEEM
TO
GET
IT
TO
WORK
WITH
THE
SCSI
CONTROLLER
IN
MY
COMPUTER
THE
GUY
TESTED
IT
WITH
HIS
PC
AND
PRINTED
OUT
A
COPY
OF
THE
NORTON
DISK
DOCTOR
REPORT
WHICH
SAYS
IT
HAS
NO
BAD
SECTORS
ILL
SEND
YOU
A
COPY
I
WAS
DUMB
ENOUGH
NOT
TO
GET
HIS
PHONE
NUMBER
SO
I
CANT
RETURN
IT
TO
HIM
THE
DRIVE
HAS
MANY
JUMPERS
ON
IT
WHICH
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
SET
SO
MAYBE
THATS
THE
PROBLEM
I
WAS
QUITE
DISAPPOINTED
THAT
IT
DIDNT
WORK
SO
IM
TRYING
TO
MINIMIZE
MY
LOSSES
MEG
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
CONNER
MODEL
SAME
SITUATION
AS
ABOVE
I
BOUGHT
BOTH
OF
THESE
DRIVES
FROM
THE
SAME
GUY
DESPITE
THE
DIFFERENT
MODEL
NUMBERS
THEY
ARE
THE
SAME
EXACT
DRIVE
SAME
REPORT
FROM

I
HAVE
ONE
FOR
EACH

BE
INCLUDED
MEG
SONY
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
SONY
MODEL
THE
DRIVE
MECHANISM
IS
COMPLETELY
TRASHED
THIS
HARD
DRIVE
WAS
IN
MY
COMPUTER
MAC
SE
AND
HAD
A
STICTION
PROBLEM
WELL
REPEATED
BANGING
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
COMPUTER
RESULTED
IN
A
HEAD
CRASH
YES
METAL
SCRAPING
METAL
WHICH
WAS
NOT
TOO
PLEASANT
TO
LISTEN
TO
STILL
THE
SCSI
CONTROLLER
CARD
IS
IN
GOOD
WORKING
ORDER
AND
CAN
BE
USED
FOR
PARTS
OR
A
PROJECT
MEG
SEAGATE
HH
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
MODEL
I
ORIGINALLY
BOUGHT
THIS
DRIVE
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
A
SMALL
STICTION
PROBLEM
AND
I
THOUGH
THAT
I
COULD
FIX
IT
WELL
I
DETERMINED
THAT
THE
DRIVE
MECHANISM
WAS
FINE
AND
THAT
IT
WAS
A
CONTROLLER
PROBLEM
MOTOR
CONTROLLER
WASNT
SENDING
PROPER
SIGNALS
WELL
AFTER
TAKING
THE
CONTROLLER
OFF
THE
DRIVE
LOOKING
AT
IT
AND
PUTTING
IT
BACK
TOGETHER
I
REALIZED
THAT
I
ACCIDENTALLY
SEVERED
ONE
OF
THE
SMALL
FLAT
CABLES
THAT
CONNECT
THE
DRIVE
TO
THE
CONTROLLER
I
TRIED
TO
SOLDER
IT
BUT
IM
NOT
THAT
GOOD
AT
SOLDERING
SO
I
COULDNT
DO
IT
WORKED
PERFECTLY
BEFORE
I
MESSED
UP
I
USED
IT
AS
A
TEMPORARY
DRIVE
WHEN
THE
SONY
ABOVE
CRASHED
ON
ME
ALSO
LOADED
THE
DRIVE
WITH
ABOUT
TWENTY
MAC
APPLICATIONS
WORTH
WELL
OVER
CLARIS
CAD
MS
WORD
THINK
C
EXCEL
AND
MANY
OTHERS
I
THINK
ALL
IT
NEEDS
IS
A
RESOLDERING
OF
THAT
CABLE
YOU
ALSO
GET
ALL
THE
SOFTWARE
ON
THE
DRIVE
IF
YOU
CAN
ACCEPT
BEING
A
PIRATE
I
ONLY
ASK
THAT
YOU
DELETE
MY
DATA
FILES
FROM
THE
DRIVE
I
WAS
REALLY
ANGRY
WHEN
I
BROKE
THAT
CONNECTION
AND
THEN
COULDNT
FIX
IT
I
JUST
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
PLAY
WITH
IT
ANY
MORE
ATT
ISDN
MODEM
THIS
IS
FOR
USE
ON
DIGITAL
PHONE
SYSTEMS
IF
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
THIS
IS
OR
WOULD
LIKE
TECHNICAL
INFORMATION
ON
IT
LET
ME
KNOW
I
HAVE
SOME
TECH
DOCUMENTS
ON
IT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
THE
SAME
THING
AS
AN
ATT
DIGITAL
PHONE
BUT
WITHOUT
THE

PART
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
IN
WORKING
ORDER
PASSES
SELF
TEST
PERFECTLY
OK
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
THIS
IS
WORTH
LET
ME
KNOW
IF
YOURE
INTERESTED
MOTOROLA

I
HAVENT
TESTED
THIS
ONE
OUT
YET
BUT
IF
ANYONE
IS
INTERESTED
I
WILL
GET
IT
TESTED
OUT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
IT
WORKS
I
HAD
TROUBLE
USING
IT
WITH
MY
ACCELERATOR
BOARD
BUT
THEN
I
SPOKE
TO
THE
MANUFACTURER
OF
THE
BOARD
AND
FOUND
OUT
IT
COULDNT
BE
USED
WITHOUT
ANOTHER

SO
I
CANT

I
THINK
IT
WORKS
NOT

BUT
I
SUPPOSE
SOMEONE
WHO
