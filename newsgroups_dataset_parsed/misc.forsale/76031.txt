WHAT
HE
WANTS
AGAIN
IVE
USED
THE
AND
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
I
CAN
CERTAINLY
UNDERSTAND
WHY
IT
IS
AS
POPULAR
AS
IT
IS
IVE
BEEN
USING
ONE
FOR
A
LITTLE
WHILE
AND
ALTHOUGH
I
HAD
SOME
PROBLEMS
WITH
IT
RECENTLY
I
SHOULD
ALSO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THE
PARTICULAR
ONE
I
WAS
USING
HAD
BEEN
ON
THE
ROAD
FOR
TWO
YEARS
AND
HAD
TRULY
BEEN
USED
DURING
THAT
TIME
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
EXACT
DAT
MACHINE
THAT
WAS
LUGGED
AROUND

US
AND
CANADA
TO
RECORD
THE
JAZZ
BUTCHER

THEIR
RECENT
LIVE
ALBUM
BRYAN
DAVIS
SAYS
I
KNOW
AT
LEAST
HALF
A
DOZEN
PROFESSIONAL
MUSICIANS
AND
RECORD
LABELS
IN
SF
WHO
USE
THAT
MODEL
AND
HAVE
BEEN
FOR
A
WHILE
WITH
NO
REPORTED
PROBLEM
MY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
EVERYONE
I
KNOW
ALREADY
HAS
ONE
NUFF
SAID
THE
REASON
IM
NOT
GETTING

IS
THAT
I
FOUND
SOMEONE
ELSE
