PLEASE
LET
YOUR
DIRECT

MARKETING
REP
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
THANKS
IT
IS
MY
IMPRESSION
THAT
NET
ETIQUETTE
DOES
NOT
ALLOW
COMPANIES
TO
USE
THE
NET
TO
DIRECTLY
ADVERTISE
THEIR
PRODUCTS
THE
NET
IS
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
A
DUMPING
GROUND
FOR
FREE
ADS
BUT
RESERVING
IT
FOR
TRIPE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
A
SIGNIFICANT
IMPROVEMENT
IN
ADDITION
TO
IMPROPER
ETIQUETTE
THIS
PRODUCT
IS
A
MAILING
LIST
USED
FOR
GENERATING
JUNK
MAIL
SO
EITHER
THEY
TARGET
IT
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
PAY
FOR
IT
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THEY
MANAGE
TO
SEND
IT
TO
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
THE
STUFF
IN
WHICH
CASE
IT
IS
JUNK
ONLY
FOR
THE
REST
AND
THE
TRANSACTION
COSTS
ARE
BORNE
APPROPRIATELY
IN
THIS
CASE
OR
THEY
GO
BANKRUPT
SEEMS
FAIR
TO
ME
AM
I
CORRECT
IN
ASSUMING
THIS
IS
IMPROPER
AND
IF
SO
WHAT
CAN
BE
DONE
TO
PENALIZE
SUCH
AN
IMPROPER
USE
YOU
COULD
HOLD
YOUR
BREATH
YOU
COULD
KILL
OFFENDING
MESSAGES
AS
THEY
COME
ONTO
YOUR
MACHINE
AND
REFUSE
TO
SEND
THEM
ANY
FURTHER
BUT
NOT
UNTIL
YOU
