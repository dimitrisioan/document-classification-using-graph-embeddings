BY
HORRORSOFTACCOLADE
BY
THE
SAME
FOLKS
WHO
BROUGHT
YOU
ELVIRA
I
II
I
PLAYED
ELVIRA
I
II
AND
THINK
THAT
HORRORSOFT
HAS
FINALLY
MADE
A
VERY
PLAYABLE
GAME
WITH
WAXWORKS
THE
LOOK
AND
FEEL
IS
ROUGHLY
THE
SAME
AS
IN
THE
ELVIRA
GAMES
THOUGH
THE
REAL
TIME
FIGHTING
IS
A
LITTLE
EASIER
TO
SURVIVE
THE
FIRST
TWO
GAMES
ESPECIALLY
ELVIRA
II
JAWS
OF
CERBERUS
MADE
IT
VERY
TOUGH
TO
STAY
ALIVE
AND
HITPOINT
RESTORING
WAS
VERY
DIFFICULT
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
WAXWORKS
IS
A
WALK
IN
THE
PARK
BUT
IT
IS
QUITE
FAIR
IN
THAT
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
SOME
WEAPON
TO
BE
FOUND
THAT
IS
QUITE
EFFECTIVE
OR
HINT
GIVEN
AS
TO
THE
PROPER
FIGHTING
STRATEGY
IN
ONE
OF
THE
FOUR
WAX
WORKS
TO
BE
EXPLORED
THERE
IS
NO
FIGHTING
AT
ALL
WELL
ALMOST
NONE
THOUGH
ALL
FOUR
CONTAIN
MODERATELY
CHALLANGING
PUZZLES
THE
REALLY
INTERESTING
THING
ABOUT
THIS
GAME
IS
THAT
IT
IS
REALLY
BROKEN
UP
INTO
FOUR
SEPERATE
RPGS
ONE
FOR
EACH
OF
THE
FOUR
EXHIBITS
YOU
MUST
ENTER
IN
STARTING
EACH
ONE
YOUR
CHARACTER
IS
TRANSPORTED
WITH
NO
OBJECTS
TO
USE
AND
EXPERIENCE
LEVEL
ONE
EXHIBITS
TRAPS
YOU
INSIDE
A
MULTILEVEL
ANCIENT
EGYPTIAN
PYRAMID
WHICH
YOU
MUST
ESCAPE
BY
FIGHTING
MAPPING
AND
PUZZLE
SOLVING
ANOTHER
EXHIBIT
TRAPS
YOU
IN
A
MINE
THAT
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
OVER
BY
CREEPING
PLANT
VINES
AND
PODS
WHILE
THE
LOCAL
HUMANS
HAVE
BEEN
TRANSFORMED
INTO
PLANT
ZOMBIES
THIS
IS
A
SINGLE
LEVEL
MAZE
THAT
REQUIRES
YOU
TO
RESCUE
SOME
HUMANS
KILL
THE
HEAD
PLANT
ALIEN
AND
FIGUERE
OUT
HOW
TO
KILL
THE
VERY
TUFF
PLANT
ZOMBIES
THAT
ARE
ALWAYS
SHOWING
UP
THIS
IS
PERHAPS
THE
MOST
HORRIFYING
EXHIBIT
ANOTHER
EXHIBIT
PUTS
YOU
INTO
JACK
THE
RIPPER
ENGLAND
WHERE
YOU
APPEAR
BY
THE
CORPSE
OF
A
FRESH
RIPPER
VICTIM
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
POLICE
THINK
YOU
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
YOU
MUST
AVOID
POLICE
AND
ANGRY
MOBS
TO
UNRAVEL
THE
MYSTERY
OF
THE
RIPPER
AND
MEET
HIM
FACE
TO
FACE
BUT
FIRST
GET
A
DISQUISE
THE
LAST
EXHIBIT
PUS
YOU
IN
A
GRAVEYARD
WHERE
MOST
OF
THE
CHALLENGE
IS
IN
LEARNING
TO
STOP
THE
ALMOST
INDESTRUCTIBLE
ZOMBIES
OVER
ALL
THE
VGA
GRAPHICS
AND
MUSIC
ARE
VERY
EFFECTIVE
IN
SETTING
A
CREEPY
TONE
FOR
THE
GAME
AS
WAS
THE
CASE
FOR
THE
ELVIRA
GAMES
THOUGH
GAMEPLAY
IS
MUCH
IMPROVED
AND
MAKES
FOR
A
MUCH
MORE
ENJOYABLE
GAME
