hello
neogeo
owners
and
nonowners
who
couldnt
resist
the
title
i
was
wondering
if
any
of
you
out
there
want
to
trade
or
sell
games
i
mean
buying
them
from
the
stores
can
get
kinda
expensive
is
a
little
too
much
to
be
spending
on
each
game
but
ahh
the
quality
now
i
can
get
them
for
about
but
thats
still
a
lot
right
now
i
have
crossed
swords
magician
lord
baseball
stars
fatal
fury
i
am
interested
in
buying
more
titles
if
any
of
you

any
interesting
trade
ideas
