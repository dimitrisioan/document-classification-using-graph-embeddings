APOLOGY
PRINTING
DEAR
FELLOW
USENET
USERS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GIVE
A
FORMAL
APOLOGY
FOR
POSTING
AN
ADVERTISEMENT
ABOUT
MY
PRINTING
BUSINESS
I
DID
NOT
INTEND
THIS
TO
BE
AN
ADVERTISEMENT
BUT
RATHER
AN
OFFER
FOR
PEOPLE
ON
THE
USENET
MANY
OF
WHOM
USE
PRINTING
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
I
WAS
NOT
AWARE
THAT
THIS
IS
NOT
LEGAL
ON
THE
USENET
I
AM
ONLY
TRYING
TO
PUT
MYSELF
THROUGH
COLLEGE
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
REQUESTED
INFORMATION
I
WILL
WRITE
TO
YOU
PRIVATELY
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
ARE
HAVING
FUN
FLOODING
MY
MAILBOX
I
THINK
YOU
CAN
GROW
UP
TO
OFFER
ADVICE
IS
ONE
THING
BUT
TO
USE
PROFANITY
TOWARD
ME
IS
ANOTHER
THANK
YOU
MARC
