is
anybody
awake
out
there
when
someone
posted
a
message
telling
people
to
stop
posting
computer
ads
to
the
miscforsale
group
he
got
about
thirty
response
here
not
to
mention
the
rash
of
email
im
sure
he
received
yet
another
person
posts
a
message
with
the
subject
line
blow
me
and
an
even
worse
text
and
only
or
people
have
the
guts
to
say
anything
the
majority
not
to
mention
the
thread
about
selling
someones
wife
i
am
a
guy
therefore
not
overly
bummed
by
it
but
a
little
common

would
dictate
that
this
is
offensive
to
many
women
and
not
really
necessary
