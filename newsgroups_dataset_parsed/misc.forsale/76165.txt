NOT
ALL
DEALS
ARE
BAD
FELLOW
NETTERS
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
LET
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
HONEST
AND
GOOD
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
EVEN
OUTSIDE
OF
IOWA
IM
SORRY
IF
ANYONE
THINKS
THAT
I
AM
WASTING
SPACE
BUT
I
THOUGHT
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
SOME
RELIEF
FROM
THE
SOANDSO
IS
A
THIEF
POSTS
NOT
THAT
I
THINK
WE
SHOULDNT
HEAR
ABOUT
THE
BAD
DEALS
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
HEAR
SOME
GOOD
NEWS
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
AFTER
SEEING
HIS
POST
ON
ONE
OF
THE
FOR
SALE
GROUPS
I
MAILED
MR
MARK
MILLER
A
REQUEST
FOR
HIS
COPY
OF
WORDPERFECT
FOR
DOS
HE
SUGGESTED
A
PRICE
OF
IN
HIS
AD
BUT
WHEN
I
PHONED
HIM
HE
QUOTED
PLUS
SHIPPING
THAT
SOUNDED
MORE
THAN
FAIR
TO
ME
SO
I
TOLD
HIM
THAT
I
WOULD
SEND
HIM
A
CHECK
THE
NEXT
DAY
IMAGINE
MY
SURPRISE
WHEN
I
LOGGED
INTO
MY
ACCOUNT
THE
FOLLOWING
DAY
AND
FOUND
A
MESSAGE
FROM
HIM
SAYING
THAT
IT
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
SOLD
AFTER
I
HAD
JUST
MAILED
THE
MONEY
ORDER
AFTER
ANOTHER
EMAIL
MESSAGE
TO
HIM
HE
APOLOGIZED
AND
ASSURED
ME
THAT
IT
WAS
A
MISTAKE
I
WAS
THE
ONE
WHO
HE
WAS
HOLDING
IT
FOR
HE
SENT
THE
PACKAGE
AS
SOON
AS
HE
GOT
THE
MONEY
ALONG
WITH
A
LETTER
STATING
A
TRANSFER
OF
LICENSE
THIS
WASNT
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
WORDPERFECT
SO
I
ASKED
HIM
TO
FILL
OUT
ONE
OF
THEIR
FORMS
NO
PROBLEM
WE
THOUGHT
IT
TOOK
THREE
TIMES
TO
GET
IT
TO
THE
RIGHT
ADDRESS
MY
FAULT
ANYWAY
HE
MAILED
ME
THE
FORM
FOR
MY
SIGNATURE
AND
INCLUDED
A
WORKBOOK
THAT
I
HAD
NO
IDEA
WAS
INCLUDED
IN
THE
DEAL
AGAIN
HE
APOLOGIZED
FOR
NOT
SENDING
IT
BEFORE
I
NOW
HAVE
THE
WORLDS
BEST
WORD
PROCESSOR
AND
A
RENEWED
HOPE
IN
THE
WORLD
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
GOOD
ONES
LEFT
I
RECOEND
THAT
IF
YOU
EVER
SEE
THAT
MARK
IS
SELLING
ANYTHING
THATAT
YOU
MAY
WANT
GIVE
HIM
A
CALL
IF
I
HAD
THE
CHOICE
I
WOULD
PURCHASE
ALL
OF
MY
SOFTWARE
FROM
HIM
BRAVO

MILLER
