CPU

FOR

CYRIX
AMD
NOT
INTEL
CLONES
BEWARE
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
NEITHER
THE
AMD
OR
CYRIX
ARE
CLONES
OF
THE
INTEL
THEY
ARE
USING
THE
NAME
BECAUSE
THEY
RUN
AS
FAST
AS
A
INTEL
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
INSTUCTION
SET
NOR
DO
THEY
FIT
INTO
THE
SAME
SOCKET
MOST
ARE
VERY
FAST
WITHOUT
COPROCESSORS
AMD
RECENT
WON
THE
APPEAL
AGAINST
INTEL
TO
USE
THEIR
MICROCODE
SO
THEY
SHOULD
BE
PUTTING
OUT
REAL
CHIPS
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
