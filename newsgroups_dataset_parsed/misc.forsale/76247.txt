digital
voice
processor
for
sale
hi
all
i
have
a
korg
for
sale
for
shipping
for
those
whove
not
had
the
pleasure
it
is
a
midi
controlled
no
keyboard
of
its
own
rackmountable
digital
voice
processor
what
can
it
do
with
your
voice
it
can
pitchshift
it
change
the
notes
you
sing
it
can
add
harmonies
to
your
singing
up
to
parts
at
one
time
it
can
change
your
voice
into
a
synthesizers
voice
but
leave
what
you
say
alone
and
intelligible
this
works
well
for
a
computerized
sounding
singer
or
robot
voice
for
those
of
you
who
just
thought
about
that
yes
you
can
do
the
voices
from
robocop
and
the
old
elo
leadins
with
it
and
yes
im
a
little
redfaced
to
say
that
i
tried
those
specifically
for
an
input
it
takes
both
xlr
mic
and
cables
for
output
you
can
have
a
combination
of
the
originalinputonly
and
your
choice
of
mix
between
the
original
signal
and
the
effect
can
be
effect
only
if
desired
it
has
preset
setups
which
you
can
edit
and
save
for
your
own
preferences
it
has
a
couple
of
light
scratches
but
does
not
look
bad
and
works
flawlessly
even
when
we
dont
use
it
in
my
music
its
been
good
for
afterhours
fun
in
the
studio
the
manual
is
included
i
never
got
around
to
getting
rackears
for
it
but
it
has
only
gotten
studio
use
from
me
no
roading
so
its
not
beaten

would
want
to
oooo

responsibility
for
them
anyway
