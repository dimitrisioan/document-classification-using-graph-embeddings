jfk
autograph
for
sale
serious
inquiries
only
after
hearing
about
the
mcgovern
house
story
on
paul
harvey
i
never
had
any
idea
how
much
it
was
worth
the
autograph
is
on
a
senate
pass
card
and
is
signed
john
kennedy
i
dont
remember
if
it
was
signed
senator
john
kennedy
or
whether
or
not
it
was
dated
because
i
havent
looked
at
it
in
quite
a
while
currently
it
is
in
a
safety
deposit
box
i
would
rather
sell
to
a
private
collector
rather
then
go
through
an
auction
house
such
as
christys
since
that
would
tend
to
take
away
from
the
profit
if
you
or
any
collector
you
may
know
has
an
interest
in
this
please
send
me
an
email
expressing
your
interest
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
to
make
a
scanned
gif
of
it
available
to
prospective
buyers
