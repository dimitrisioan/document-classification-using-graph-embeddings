OPTONICA
TUNER
AND
INTEGRATED
AMP
FORSALE
I
HAVE
AN
OLD
OPTONICA
TUNER
AND
INTEGRATED
AMP
THAT
I
NO
LONGER
USE
THE
INTEGRATED
AMP
SECTION
DOES
NOT
WORK
RIGHT
NOW
BUT
SHOULD
NOT
COST
MUCH
TO
FIX
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
IS
JUST
A
CHIP
I
HAVE
USED
IT
AS
A
PREAMP
AND
IT
WORKS
GREAT
THIS
IS
A
VERY
NICE
LOOKING
AND
WELL
BUILT
SET
THEY
BOTH
ARE
LOW
PROFILE
BUT
THE
AMP
IS
RATHER
HEAVY
THE
TUNER
IS
IN
FINE
WORKING
CONDITION
AND
IS
A
MATCH
TO
THE
AMP
THE
AMP
IS
RATED
AT
THESE
PEICES
WENT
FOR
ABOUT
NEW
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
OBO
FOR
THE
PAIR
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
KNOWLEDGE
ANOUGH
TO
FIX
THE
AMP
I
HAVE
HAD
AN
ESTIMATE
DONE
THAT
IT
SHOULD
COST
LESS
THAN
IN
PARTS
PLEASE
EMAIL
ME
IF
YOU
ARE
INTERESTED
I
WILL
BE
MOVING
BACK
HOME
FOR
THE
SUMMER
AND
WILL
SELL
IT
BACK
THERE
IF
I
DO
NOT
DO
SO
HERE
