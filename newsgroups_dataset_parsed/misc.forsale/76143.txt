IN
CASE
A
DEAL
IS
A
LEMON
HI
TO
ALL
SINCE
ALL
OF
YOU
COULD
ALSO
BE
A
SELLER
AS
WELL
AS
A
BUYER
ID
LIKE
TO
BRING
THIS
ISSUE
FOR
DISCUSSION
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
BEST
SOLUTION
IN
CASE
A
DEAL
BECAME
A
LEMON
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
MOST
PEOPLE
SELLING
THINGS
OVER
THE
NET
DO
NOT
GRANT
A
WARRANTYI
AM
IN
SUCH
A
SITUATION
THAT
THE
SELLER
DID
NOT
STATE
WHETHER
A
WARRANTY
WOULD
BE
GRANTED
OR
NOT
AND
THE
ITEM
I
RECEIVED
IS
OUT
OF
ORDER
THE
SELLER
INSISTED
THAT
IT
WAS
IN
GOOD
CONDITION
WHEN
HE
SENT
IT
AND
SO
WOULD
JUST
RETURN
HALF
OFTHE
AMOUNT
THAT
I
PAID
IF
I
SEND
THE
ITEM
BACK
TO
HIM
AND
AFTER
HE
IS
SURED
IT
IS
BAD
IS
THIS
REASONABLE
BASICALLY
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BELIEVE
THE
SELLER
TELLS
THE
TRUTH
ALSO
I
AM
POSITIVELY
TO
SAY
THAT
IVE
NOT
DONE
ANYTHING
WRONG
WHICH
MIGHT
CAUSE
THE
FAILURE
OF
THE
THING
MY
ASSUMPTION
HERE
IS
EVERYONE
IS
HONEST
SO
RULE
OUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
EITHER
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
PARTIES
OR
BOTH
ARE
LIARS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
YOUR
OPINION
EITHER
IN
HERE
OR
DIRECTLY
RESPOND
TO
MY
EMAIL
ADDRESS
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
RISK
THAT
YOU
COULD
LOSE
MONEY
BUT
HOW
CAN
WE
MAKE
IT
ENJOYABLE
TO
MOST
PEOPLE
AND
NOT
WASTING
THE
BANDWIDTH
CHEIN
