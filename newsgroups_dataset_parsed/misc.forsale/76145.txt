FOR
PEANUTS
LATER
WRITES
MOTOROLA
EXPO
VHF
WOULD
LIKE
OR
BEST
OFFER
IM
SURE
THAT
THE
MOTOROLA
IS
WORTH
IT
BUT
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
HAS
ALWAYS
MYSTIFIED
ME
IS
THE
PRICE
OF
VERY
GOOD
NEW
DUALBAND
FULLY
SYNTHASIZED
HT
YES
YES
I
KNOW
MOTOROLA
HTS
ARE
BULLETPROOF
UNBREAKABLE
PLUTONIUMBASED
INDESTRUCTABLE
YOU
CAN
DRIVE
A
TANK
OVER
THEM
AND
THEYLL
STILL
WORK
BUT
JUST
HOW
OFTEN
DOES
THAT
COME
UP
WHY
ARE
HAMS
WILLING
AND
THEY
ARE
TO
SPEND
THE
PRICE
OF
A
SYNTHASZIED
DUALBANDER
FOR
A
XTAL
RIG
NOTE
THIS
IS
NOT
A
FLAME
AS
I
SAID
IM
SURE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
DEAL
FOR
THIS
RIG
IM
JUST
AMAZED
THAT
IT
IS
A
GOOD
DEAL
I
WOULD
HAVE
GUESSED
THAT
A
CHANNEL
XTAL
RIG
COULD
NEVER
BE
WORTH
AS
MUCH
AS
A
DUAL
BANDER
TO
A
HAM
NO
MATTER
HOW
DURABLE
JUST
SHOWS
YOU
HOW
WRONG
I
CAN
BE
MIKE
THESE
ARE
MY
OPINIONS
ONLY
