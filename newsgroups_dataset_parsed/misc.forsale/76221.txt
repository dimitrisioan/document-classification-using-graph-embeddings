the

of
personal
computing
tools
for
engineers
and
scien
tists
lists
hardware
cards
and
application
software
packages
for
class
machines
focus
is
on
engineering
and
scien
tific
applications
of
pcs
such
as
data
acquisitioncontrol
design
automation
and
data
analysis
and
presentation
if
you
would
like
a
free
copy
reply
with
your
u
s
postal
mailing
address
dont
bother
it
never
comes
its
a
cheap
trick
for
building
a
mailing
list
to
sell
if
my
junk
mail
flow
is
any
indication
i
have
a
copy
of
this
catalog
in
front
of
me
as
i
write
this
it
does
have
tons
of
qool
stuff
in
it
thats
one
any
others
my
impression
is
that
they
try
not
to
send
it
out
to
browsers
then
they
should
have
used
a
different
advert
it
appears
that
if
your
not
a
buyer
or
an
engineer
they
do
not
want
to
waste
a
catalog
on
you
im
both
ive
made
some
worth
of
pc
products
purchasing
decisions
for
one
company
im
affiliated
with
in
the
past
months
alone
in
a
delicious
bit
of
irony
an
interesting
fraction
went
to
suppliers
that
i
suspect
got
my
mailing
address
from
these
people
more
is
in
the
pipeline
right
now
if
they
wanted
to
discuss
these
sorts
of
things
upfront
is
the
way
to
do
it
when
you
get
a
catalog
theres
a
vip
code
you
and
who
issues
that
vip
code
that
policy
implementation
in
the
running
for
this
weeks
silly
twit
award
btw
it
turns
out
that
i
have
several
vip
codes
heres
the
one
im
using
for
these
sorts
of
things
if
you
want
one
send
me
mail
and
ill
put
you
in
touch
with
the
folks
who
do
the
application
interview
if
you
qualify
