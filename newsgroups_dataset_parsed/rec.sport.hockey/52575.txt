YESTERDAY

THEY
HAD
A
FEATURE
ON
THIS
GUY
THAT
DOES
A
LOT
MOST
OF
THE
MASKS
FOR
NHL
GOALIES
THEY
TALKED
ABOUT
HOW
THEY
ARE
MADE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
MADE
OF
AND
THE
DESIGNS
THAT
ARE
PUT
ON
THEM
ETC
ACTUALLY
THIS
PART
WAS
REALLY
INTERESTING
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
THE
MASK
IS
CUSTOMFIT
TO
THE
GOALIES
FACE
THE
GOALIE
PUTS
HISHER
FACE
THROUGH
A
PIECE
OF

IS
PUT
ON
THE
GOALTENDERS
FACE
THEN
A
PLASTER
IS
SPREAD
ON
THEIR
CHEEKS
FOREHEAD
AND
CHIN
WHICH
TAKES
ABOUT
MINUTES
TO
DRY
SUFFICIENTLY
WHEN
IT
DRIES
IT
IS
EFFECTIVELY
A
MOLD
OF
THE
GOALIES
FACE
THIS
IS
USED
AS
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
MASK
THE
REST
INVOLVES
PADDING
THE
INSIDE
HARDENING
THE
EXTERIOR
FITTING
THE
CAGE
ETC
ETC
JOHN

HE
EXHIBITED
A
COUPLE
MASKS
HE
IS
CURRENTLY
WORKING
ON
NAMELY
A
NEW

IS
A
BASIC
REWORKING
OF
HIS
CURRENT
MASK
WITH
THE
BEAR
ON
IT
AND
NEW
MASK
FOR
BOB
ESSENSA
WHICH
WAS
REALLY
COOL
THE
JETS
LOGO

THE
FOREHEAD

AN
AWESOME
LOOKING
BLACK
PANTHER
