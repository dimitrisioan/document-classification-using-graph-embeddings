RE
CBC
CANADIAN
FOR
ESPN
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
HOORAY
I
HEAR
ON
TSN
THAT
THE
JETS
HAVE
WON
A
GAME
SELANNE
GETTING
A
HATTRICK
OF
COURSE
HERE
IN
GODS
COUNTRY
READ
ONTARIO
I
COULDNT
SEE
THAT
GAME
NOR
ANY
OTHER
IN
THE
VANWPG
SERIES
SO
FAR
BECAUSE
OUR
BELOVED
CBC
FIGURES
NO
ONE
OUT
HERE
CARES
ABOUT
THIS
SERIES
WHICH
HAS
LOOKED
PRETTY
COMPETITVE
SO
FAR
ON
MONDAY
AND
WEDNESDAY
NIGHTS
CBC
COULD
HAVE
SHOWN
THE
TORONTO
DETROIT
GAME
DONE
THE
NEWS
THEN
PICKED
UP
WINNIPEGVANCOUVER
THEY
DIDNT
TONIGHT
YOU
GUESSED
IT
TORONTODETROIT
THE
NEWS
NOT
THE
END
OF
THE
JETS
GAME
THEN
CALGARYLA
SO
IF
ITS
HOCKEY
NIGHT
IN
CANADA
WHY
CANT
THIS
ONTARIAN
SEE
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
SERIES
WITH
TWO
CANADIAN
TEAMS
IS
THIS
TOO
MUCH
TO
ASK
PAUL
BADERTSCHER
ID
LIKE
TO
ECHO
THESE
SENTIMENTS
THIS
IS
THE
WORST
COVERAGE
I
CAN
EVER
REMEMBER
SEEING
ON
CBC
AS
SOON
AS
THE
GAME
ENDS
I
CAN
COUNT
TO
AND
BY
THAT
TIME
THEYVE
SIGNED
OFF
THE
AIR
NO
POST
GAME
INTERVIEWS
NO
UPDATING
OF
LATE
SCORES
NOTHIN
TSN
IS
REALLY
PUTTING
CBC
TO
SHAME
I
ONLY
HOPE
THE
LATER
ROUND
COVERAGE
IMPROVES
I
MEAN
WHO
REALLY
WANTS
TO
SEE
CBC
PRIMETIME
