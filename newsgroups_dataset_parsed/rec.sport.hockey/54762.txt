STUFF
DELETED
FOR
EXAMPLE
LOOK
AT
PAT
QUINN
OF
THE
CANUCKS
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
HE
IS
THE
BEST
GM
MERELY
A
BETTER
ONE
THAN
MURRAY
AND
ONE
I
AM
VERY
FAMILIAR
WITH
HE
TRADED
GARTH
BUTCHER
A
GOOD
PLAYER
AND
DAN
QUINN
NOT
IN
THE
NHL
ANYMORE
TO
ST
LOUIS
FOR
CLIFF
RONNING
GEOFF
COURTNALL
SERGIO
MOMMESSO
AND
ROBERT
DIRK
TOO
GOOD
TO
BE
TRUE
RIGHT
I
THINK
THIS
GOES
ALONG
WITH
A
COMMENT
YOU
MADE
IN
AN
EARLIER
POST
NAMELY
QUINN
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
A
MAJOR
LEAGUE
BONEHEAD
FOR
A
GM
IN
ST
LOUIS
THIS
TRADE
WAS
AN
ABSOLUTELY
STUPID
TRADE
FOR
ST
LOUIS
AND
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
ONLY
STUPID
TRADE
THAT
THIS
GUY
MADE
WE
CAN
GIVE
QUINN
CREDIT
FOR
BEING
AN
OPPORTUNIST
HERE
STUFF
ABOUT
OTHER
TRADES
DELETED
PLUS
HIS
TEAM
HAS
IMPROVED
A
MUCH
GREATER
AMOUNT
THAN
DETROIT
SINCE
HE
TOOK
OVER
WITH
THEM
HOW
DO
YOU
FIGURE
BOTH
VANCOUVER
AND
DETROIT
DID
THE
SAME
THING
LAST
YEAR
THEY
BOTH
WON
THEIR
DIVISION
THEY
HAD
CLOSE
TO
THE
SAME
NUMBER
OF
POINTS
THEY
BOTH
WENT
DOWN
IN
THE
FIRST
ROUND
OF
THE
PLAYOFFS
BEFORE
FINALLY
ESCAPING
IN
GAMES
AND
THEY
BOTH
GOT
KNOCKED
OUT
IN
THE
SECOND
ROUND
BY
TEAMS
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
BEAT
WITH
LESS
TALENT
SPECIFICALLY
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
THIRD
PLACE
TEAMS
HOW
DOES
THIS
MAKE
VANCOUVER
MORE
IMPROVED
FURTHER
IF
IM
NOT
MISTAKEN
THE
WINGS
HAD
MORE
POINTS
THAN
VANCOUVER
AT
THE
END
OF
THIS
SEASON
