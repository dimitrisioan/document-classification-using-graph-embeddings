AMONGST
PENGUINS
FANS
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
INNER
CALM
THAT
IVE
NEVER
EXPERIENCED
BEFORE
THIS
YEAR
WITH
THE
PENS
THE
PLAYERS
AND
THE
FANS
HAVE
SO
MUCH
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
TEAM
THIS
YEAR
WERE
SAVORING
EVERY
GAME
AND
SAVING
OUR
ENERGY
FOR
THE
STANLEY

THATS
NOT
INNER
CALM
ITS
BOREDOM
AND
ITS
BEING
SPOILED
THE
ARENAS

QUIET
AS
A
CHURCH
ON
MANY
NIGHTS
THIS
YEAR
TOO
MANY
OF

THE
PENS

YEARS
AGO
AND
THE
RANGERS
LAST
YEAR
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
GOOD
THING
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
GOOD
FOR
YOU
