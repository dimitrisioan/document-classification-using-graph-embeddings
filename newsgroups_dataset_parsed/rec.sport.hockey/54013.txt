amongst
penguins
fans
there
seems
to
be
an
inner
calm
that
ive
never
experienced
before
this
year
with
the
pens
the
players
and
the
fans
have
so
much
confidence
in
the
team
this
year
were
savoring
every
game
and
saving
our
energy
for
the
stanley
cup
thats
not
inner
calm
its
boredom
and
its
being
spoiled
the
arenas
been
as
quiet
as
a
church
on
many
nights
this
year
too
many
of
us
just
take
winning
for
granted
its
been
seemingly
forever
since
the
team
lost
and
weve
forgotten
what
its
like
to
feel
real
excitement
and
surprise
at
victory
while
im
glad
to
have
the
pens
doing
so
well
in
some
ways
it
was
a
better
high
back
when
the
pens
beat
the
bruins
two
years
ago
and
the
rangers
last
year
too
much
of
a
good
thing
is
not
always
good
for
you
