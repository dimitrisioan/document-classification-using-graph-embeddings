canadiens
another
stanley
cup
with
the
kind
of
team
montreal
has
now
they
can
take
the
cup
easily
the
only
problem
they
have
right
now
is
that
everyone
is
trying
to
steal
the
show
and
play
alone
they
need
some
massive
teamwork
they
are
also
in
a
little
of
a
slump
because
longtime
hockey
montreal
canadiens
announcer
claude
mouton
died
last
tuesday
and
it
was
rough
on
everybody
because
he
has
worked
with
the
organization
for
years
but
i
know
that
is
no
excuse
but
if
the
habs
manage
to
get
some
good
teamwork
and
get
into
the
spirit
they
should
have
no
problem
winning
in
may
