i
was
thinking
about
who
on
each
of
the
teams
were
the
mvps
biggest
surprises
and
biggest
disappointments
this
year
now
these
are
just
my
observations
and
are
admittedly
lacking
because
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
all
the
teams
the
same
amount
anyway
team
mvp
surprise
disappointment
edmonton
oilers
manson
buchberger
mellanby
well
since
the
oilers
didnt
win
a
heck
of
a
lot
of
games
im
not
sure
they
deserve
and
mvp
cant
win
without
him
however
id
suggest
kelly
buchberger
instead
of
dave
manson
who
has
had
a
brutal
year
his
pick
for
the
allstar
game
notwithstanding
as
for
biggest
surprise
id
say
that
buchberger
had
higher
expectations
this
year
due
to
his
breakthrough
year
for
him
last
year
so
he
didnt
really
raise
his
game
my
suggestion
would
be
shjon
podein
one
of
the
callups
from
cape
breton
during
the
year
he
was
quite
far
down
on
the
depth
chart
in
the
oilers
stable
of
prospects
but
made
a
big
impact
on
the
team
he
has
goals
in
his
games
and
is
only
those
are
decent
numbers
for
a
thirdline
player
who
was
seemingly
doomed
to
minorleague
oblivion
the
oilers
coaching
staff
likens
his
style
to
john
tonelli
i
think
hell
be
on
the
fulltime
roster
next
year
as
for
biggest
disappointment
you
could
name
any
of
the
players
the
oilers
dumped
for
lousy
production
this
year
nicholls
gilchrist
tikkanen
or
even
shayne
corson
but
mellanby
isnt
far
off
