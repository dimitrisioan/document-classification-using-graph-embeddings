ESPN

RANDOLINPOLISCIUMNEDU
ROBERT
ANDOLINA
WRITES
THE
THING
THAT
CONFUSES
ME
MOST
ABOUT
ESPN
IS
THAT
THEY
DECIDED
TO
SHOW
THE
PENGUINS
AND
DEVILS
AGAIN
ON
THURSDAY
NIGHT
BEING
THAT
BOTH
OF
THE
FIRST
TWO
GAMES
WERE
DOMINATED
BY
PITT
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THEY
WOULD
SHOW
A
DIFFERENT
GAME
THIS
IS
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
SHOW
OTHER
GAMES
JUST
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
FAIR
EXPOSURE
ESPN
MUST
HAVE
SOME
VERY
POOR
MARKETING
PEOPLE
THEY
ARE
ONLY
CONCERNED
WITH
FEATURING
PLAYERS
IE
MARIO
THAN
FEATURING
GOOD
COMPETITIVE
HOCKEY
ALSO
SOME
OF
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
ESPN
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
SHOW
CAMPBELL
CONFERENCE
GAMES
REGULARLY
IN
THE
FIRST
TWO
ROUNDS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
ARE
ONLY
GOING
TO
SHOW
CAMPBELL
GAMES
IN
THE
FIRST
TWO
ROUNDS
AS
THOSE
SERIES
WEAR
ON
GAMES
OR
PERHAPS
GAMES
IVE
HEARD
THAT
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
THEIR
MARKET
IS
EAST
COAST
AND
HENCE
WOULD
PREFER
THE
WALES
STUFF
ALSO
DONT
EXPECT
CANADIAN
TEAMS
ON
ESPN
IN
SUMMARY
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
SEE
A
NETWORK
THAT
PROVIDES
GOOD
HOCKEY
COVERAGE
WATCH
CBC
FROM
CANADA
THEY
MAY
BE
BIASED
TOWARD
CANADIAN
TEAMS
BUT
THEY
DONT
TREAT
THE
VIEWERS
LIKE
IDIOTS
THEY
PROVIDE
NICE
UPDATES
AND
DON
CHERRY
WILL
ALWAYS
PROVIDE
A
FEW
LAUGHS
