wirtz
is
a
weenie
so
whats
the
deal
with
bill
wirtz
apparently
the
blackhawks
st
louis
game
was
a
standing
room
only
sell
out
as
usual
but
the
hawks
reported
the
attendace
as
gee
i
wonder
if
wirtz
is
planning
to
use
this
as
justification
for
continuing
to
keep
home
games
off
of
tv
what
a
schmuck
in
other
tv
news
the
penguins
announced
yesterday
that
they
will
have
fewer
broadcast
tv
games
and
will
have
games
on
some
sort
of
subscription
payperview
system
yuck
