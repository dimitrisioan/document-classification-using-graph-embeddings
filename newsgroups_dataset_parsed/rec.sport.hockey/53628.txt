THE
SUBJECT
LINE
SAYS
IT
ALL
IS
IT
TERRIBLY
DIFFICULT
TO
GET
TICKETS
TO
PENGUINS
GAMES
ESPECIALLY
NOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
WOULD
IT
BE
EASY
TO
FIND
SCALPERS
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
IGLOO
SELLING
TICKETS
THERE
ARE
ALWAYS
SCALPERS
WITH
TICKETS
OUTSIDE
THE
ARENA
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
PAY
A
FEW
BUCKS
EXTRA
BUT
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
FIND
THEM
LOOK
ON
THE
STREET
UNDER
THE
MESSAGE
BOARD
OR
OUT
ON
THE
STREET
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
HYATT
OR
EVEN
AROUND
GATE
THE
LATER
YOU
BUY
THEM
THE
LESS
MONEY
YOULL
PAY
AND
DURING
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
YOU
COULD
USUALLY
FIND
SOME
FOR
NEAR
FACE
VALUE
OR
BELOW
IF
YOU
WAIT
UNTIL
GAME
TIME
MIGHT
BE
BETTER
TO
PICK
THEM
UP
EARLIER
NOW
THOUGH
RICK
