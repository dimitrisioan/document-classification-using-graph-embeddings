RE
WINGS
NEWS
AND
PLAYOFF
THOUGHTS
AS
FAR
AS
CHEVELDAE
IS
CONCERNED
HE
IS
A
DECENT
GOALIE
THE
MOST
LOGICAL
TRADE
IN
THE
OFFSEASON
TO
ME
WOULD
BE
BETWEEN
DETROIT
AND
NY
RANGERS
IM
SURE
IF
BEEZER
WOULD
BE
TRADED
HE
WOULD
ENJOY
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GO
BACK
TO
HIS
ROOTS
IN
DETROIT
HE
WOULD
BE
A
VALUABLE
ASSET
TO
THE
WINGS
AND
PERHAPS
THE
RANGERS
COULD
GET
A
ZOMBO
IN
RETURN
BEEZER
GOT
A
FEW
GOOD
YEARS
IN
HIM
AND
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GET
A
FRESH
START
WOULD
ENERGIZE
HIS
PLAY
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ZOMBO
WAS
TRADED
TO
ST
LOUIS
LAST
YEAR
FOR
GOALIE
VINCENT
RIENDEAU
I
THINK
THAT
WHILE
CHEVY
IS
NOT
AMONG
THE
ELITE
CLASS
OF
GOALIES
HE
IS
ADEQUATE
GIVEN
THE
OFFENSIVE
FIREPOWER
OF
THE
WINGS
