MOVE
THE
CAPS

HE
OWNS
THE
CAP
CENTRE
I
KNOW
THEY
DONT
SELL
OUT
ALL
OF
THEIR
GAMES
BUT
THEY
DRAW
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THE
BULLETS
IF
YOU
HAD
THE
SITUATION
THAT
ABE
HAD
WOULD
YOU
MOVE
IF
YOU
WERE
GUARANTEED
THAT
ANYONE
WHO
WENT
TO
THE
GAMES
WOULD
HAVE
TO
PARK
AT
THE
STADIUM
BECAUSE
THERE
HAS
BEEN
NOTHING
WITHIN
A
HALF
MILE
UNTIL
THE
RECENT
CONSTRUCTION
IN
THE
AREA
CAN
THEY
WIN
A
GAME
IN
OT
