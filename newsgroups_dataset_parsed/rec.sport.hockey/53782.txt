SHARKS
REVIEW
PART
DEFENSEMEN
I
FINALLY
GOT
IT
BACK
WITH
GREAT
THANKS
TO
MARK
SPIEGEL
FOR
SAVING
AND
SENDING
IT
ROB
ZETTLER
SEASON
ACQUIRED
FROM
MINNESOTA
IN
DISPERSAL
DRAFT
GRADE
CC
ZETTLER
GAVE
THE
SHARKS
EVERY
BIT
HES
GOT
THIS
YEAR
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
STILL
WASNT
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
HIM
ANY
MORE
THAN
A
MARGINAL
NHLER
IF
THAT
HE
WORKS
HARD
FOR
SURE
BUT
IS
NO
BETTER
THAN
AVERAGE
ON
DEFENSE
AND
IS
PRONE
TO
COSTLY
PENALTIES
AND
DEFENSIVE
LAPSES
AT
TIMES
WHILE
BEING
BASICALLY
AN
OFFENSIVE
ZERO
GOAL
AND
ASSISTS
IN
GAMES
HE
WOULD
BE
HARDPRESSED
TO
MAKE
THE
TEAM
NEXT
YEAR
DAVID
WILLIAMS
SEASON
ACQUIRED
FREE
AGENT
FROM
NEW
JERSEY
GRADE
CC
IMO
WILLIAMS
WAS
THE
MOST
VALUABLE
DEFENSEMAN
FOR
THE
SHARKS
IN
PLAYING
A
COMBINATION
OF
GOOD
OFFENSE
GOALS
AND
ASSISTS
IN
GAMES
AND
GOOD
DEFENSE
BUT
HE
PLAYING
THE
FIRST
PART
OF
THIS
SEASON
IN
KANSAS
CITY
WAS
GOOD
NEITHER
OFFENSIVELY
NOR
DEFENSIVELY
THIS
YEAR
IT
THEN
APPEARS
THAT
WAS
A
FLUKE
ALTHOUGH
HE
IMPROVED
TOWARDS
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
HE
WAS
PRONE
TO
BEING
OUT
OF
POSITION
DEFENSIVELY
AND
DID
NOT
DEMONSTRATE
THE
PLAYMAKING
SKILLS
THAT
MADE
HIM
THE
TEAMS
LEADING
SCORER
AMONG
DEFENSEMEN
LAST
YEAR
HE
WOULD
ALSO
BE
HARDPRESSED
TO
MAKE
THE
TEAM
NEXT
YEAR
JAYSON
MORE
SEASON
ACQUIRED
FROM
MONTREAL
IN
EXPANSION
DRAFT
GRADE
B
AFTER
BEING
TOUTED
AS
THE
TEAMS
TOP
DEFENSIVE
PROSPECTS
IN
TRAINING
CAMP
BEFORE
MORE
HAD
A
RATHER
DISAPPOINTING
AS
HE
WAS
NOT
PARTICULARLY
GOOD
DEFENSIVELY
AND
HAD
JUST
POINTS
IN
GAMES
HE
THEN
PROCEEDED
TO
IMPROVE
HIS
GAME
MASSIVELY
THIS
SEASON
BECOMING
THE
TEAMS
MOST
RELIABLE
DEFENSEMAN
WHOM
THE
TEAM
CAN
COUNT
ON
NIGHT
IN
AND
NIGHT
OUT
TO
PLAY
STEADY
DEFENSE
AND
PROVIDING
OCCASIONAL
BUT
ONLY
OCCASIONAL
OFFENSIVE
FLASH
OFFENSIVELY
HE
WAS
EVEN
MORE
DISAPPOINTING
THAN
LAST
YEAR
POINTS
IN
GAMES
BUT
HIS
DEFENSE
IMPROVED
TREMENDOUSLY
HE
IS
PROBABLY
BEST
AS
THE
DEFENSIVE
PART
OF
A
DEFENSE
COMBINATION
WITH
AN
OFFENSIVE
DEFENSEMAN
NEIL
WILKINSON
SEASON
ACQUIRED
FROM
MINNESOTA
IN
DISPERSAL
DRAFT
GRADE
B
WILKINSON
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
TEAMS
TOP
DEFENSIVE
DEFENSEMAN
IN
HOWEVER
PARTIALLY
BECAUSE
OF
INJURIES
HE
WAS
NOT
THE
SAME
THIS
YEAR
AS
HE
MISSED
GAMES
TOTAL
DUE
TO
NAGGING
KNEE
AND
BACK
INJURIES
AND
SEEMED
TO
BE
SLOWED
EVEN
WHEN
PLAYING
HE
THEN
HAD
OFTEN
TO
BE
SAVED
BY
HIS
DEFENSIVE
PARTNERS
THAT
IS
IF
THEY
ARE
THERE
AT
ALL
BUT
HE
ALSO
HAD
SOME
SOLID
GAMES
AND
IF
HE
CAN
BE
COMPLETE
HEALTHY
HE
CAN
STILL
BE
A
FORCE
SANDIS
OZOLINSH
SEASON
ACQUIRED
ROUND
PICK
IN
ENTRY
DRAFT
GRADE
I
A
AT
THE
TIME
OF
HIS
INJURY
DECEMBER
AGAINST
THE
PHILADELPHIA
FLYERS
OZOLINSH
WAS
WELL
ON
TRACK
TO
BE
IMO
THE
TEAMS
MVP
A
SERIOUS
KNEE
INJURY
IN
THAT
GAME
THOUGH
FORCED
HIM
TO
MISS
THE
REST
OF
THE
SEASON
GAMES
BUT
HE
STILL
FINISHED
AS
THE
TEAMS
TOP
SCORER
AMONG
DEFENSEMEN
POINTS
WHICH
OF
COURSE
TELLS
MORE
ABOUT
THE
LACK
OF
OFFENSE
THE
SHARKS
HAD
FROM
THEIR
DEFENSEMEN
BUT
IT
ALSO
TELLS
OF
OZOLINSHS
ABILITIES
AT
THE
TIME
HE
WAS
PLAYING
VERY
GOOD
DEFENSE
ALONG
WITH
EXCELLENT
OFFENSE
HE
WAS
STILL
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
SOCALLED
ROOKIE
MISTAKES
BUT
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
DEFENSEMAN
WHO
MADE
THE
LEAST
OF
THEM
ON
THE
TEAM
ROOKIE
OR
VETERAN
IF
HE
CAN
COME
BACK
FROM
HIS
INJURIES
HE
IS
READY
TO
BE
A
STAR
DOUG
ZMOLEK
SEASON
ACQUIRED
FROM
MINNESOTA
IN
DISPERSAL
DRAFT
GRADE
B
ZMOLEK
HAD
BASICALLY
A
SOLID
AND
DURABLE
YEAR
BEING
ONE
OF
THE
ONLY
TWO
SHARKS
TO
PLAY
IN
ALL
GAMES
OF
THE
SEASON
HE
WAS
SOLID
ON
DEFENSE
BUT
AFTER
BEING
BILLED
AS
AN
OFFENSIVE
DEFENSEMAN
HE
DIDNT
SHOW
IT
POINTS
HE
WAS
ALSO
PRONE
TO
PENALTIES
AND
HIS
PENALTY
MINUTES
WAS
SECOND
ON
THE
TEAM
HOWEVER
THAT
WAS
ALSO
AN
INDICATION
THAT
HE
WAS
FEARLY
WHEN
FACING
TOUGH
PHYSICAL
OPPONENTS
AND
HE
WAS
AT
HIS
BEST
WHEN
PLAYING
PHYSICALLY
BUT
TO
BECOME
A
FIXTURE
IN
THIS
LEAGUE
HE
NEEDS
TO
IMPROVE
BOTH
OFFENSIVELY
AND
DEFENSIVELY
AND
CUT
DOWN
ON
THE
NUMBER
OF
POWERPLAYS
HE
GIVES
TO
OPPONENTS
