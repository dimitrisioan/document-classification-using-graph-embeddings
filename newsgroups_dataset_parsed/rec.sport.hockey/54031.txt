GHOST
FROM
SWEENEYS
PAST
WOW
THIS
GUY
SEEMS
TO
BE
OUT
TO
PROVE
SOMETHING
TO
HIS
OLD
TEAM
BOSTON
WHICH
SWEENEY
YOU
ASKWELL
OF
COURSE
BOB
SWEENEY
THE
ONE
THAT
BOSTON
LET
BUFFALO
GET
A
HOLD
OF
THEY
STILL
HAVE
SWEENEYS
WHICH
MAKES
THINGS
SLIGHTLY
CONFUSING
GAME
WINNER
IN
OT
IN
GAME
AND
ANOTHER
BIG
GOAL
SECONDS
AFTER
FUHR
MADE
POINT
BLANK
SAVES
THIS
IS
WHY
GRANT
HAS
RINGS
TO
PUT
BUFFALO
AHEAD
IN
THE
YES
NEELY
COUNTERED
A
MINUTE
LATER
BUT
HADNT
THIS
COURSE
OF
BUFFALO
GOING
AHEAD
AFTER
BEING
TIED
AND
SHUTTING
DOWN
ANOTHER
FEW
GREAT
SCORING
OPPORTUNITIES
I
THINK
BOSTON
WOULD
HAVE
NOTCHED
THEIR
FIRST
WIN
OF
THE
SERIES
WELL
THE
SABRES
HAVENT
MADE
IT
TO
THE
END
OF
THIS
SERIES
YET
BUT
I
CERTAINLY
FEEL
THEYVE
GOT
BOSTON
RIGHT
WERE
THEY
WANT
THEMACTUALLY
THEYVE
GOT
THEM
IN
A
POSITION
THAT
NEITHER
BUFFALO
NOR
BOSTON
FELT
THAT
WOULD
COME
ABOUT
ONE
MORE
ASTRONOMICAL
GAME
BY
FUHR
A
FEW
MORE
HEROICS
BY
THE
REST
OF
THE
TEAM
THIS
IS
A
TEAM
SPORT
AFTERALL
AND
I
THINK
BORQUE
NEELY
JOUNEAU
SP
AND
COMPANY
ARE
GONNA
BE
SWINGING
A
NEW
STICK
WEATHER
IS
PERFECT
FOR
GOLF
SEASON
REAL
SOON
IM
NOT
GONNA
WAIGER
ANYTHING
ON
THIS
BECAUSE
IVE
SEEN
SOME
REALLY
STRANGE
THINGS
HAPPEN
IN
BOTH
PRO
AND
COLLEGE
HOCKEY
TALKING
ABOUT
GOLFWAS
THAT
A
HOCKEY
SWING
GOLF
SWING
OR
BASEBALL
SWING
THAT
HAWERCHUCK
USED
IN
THE
LAST
SHOT
OF
THE
GAME
THAT
KHMYLEV
DEFLECTED
IN
FOR
THE
BIG
ONE
THE
WHOLE
OT
ALL
MINUTE
OF
IT
WAS
A
TESIMENT
TO
BUFFALOS
ABILITY
TO
REALLY
BE
PERSISTENT
AND
GRIND
IT
OUT
IN
THE
END
SOMETHING
THEY
WERENT
NECESSARILY
IN
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
THE
SABRES
PUSHED
HARD
AND
FORCED
BORQUE
TO
BLATENTLY
TAKE
DOWN
BODGER
IN
THE
OPENING
SECONDS
I
DONT
NORMALLY
LIKE
PENALTIES
BEING
CALLED
IN
SUCH
ULTRACRITICAL
POINTS
BUT
THIS
WAS
BLATENT
FINALLY
THE
SABRES
WON
A
FACEOFF
THEY
WERENT
THAT
HOT
IN
THIS
DEPT
THE
REST
OF
THE
GAME
WHEN
LAFONTAINE
SCOOPED
AT
THE
PUCK
TIMES
WHEN
HAWERCHUCK
TOOK
HIS
SHOT
QUITE
A
BOOMER
BUT
BLUE
STOPPED
THIS
ONE
HE
TOOK
A
FEW
STEPS
OVER
TO
GET
HIS
OWN
REBOUND
AND
SLAPPED
AT
IT
AGAIN
WITHOUT
SETTING
IT
UP
I
DIDNT
REALIZE
IT
WENT
IN
UNTIL
THE
ANNOUNCER
STARTED
SCREAMING
THEY
SCORE
THEY
SCORE
THE
BEST
WAS
SEEING
LAFONTAINE
JUMPING
UP
AND
DOWN
SKATING
A
LITTLE
BIT
JUMPING
SOME
MORE
AND
THEN
SKATING
OVER
TO
BRAD
