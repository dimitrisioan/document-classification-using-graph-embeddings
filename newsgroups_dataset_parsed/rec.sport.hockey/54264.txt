ROBERT
ANDOLINA
WRITES
THE
THING
THAT
CONFUSES
ME
MOST
ABOUT
ESPN
IS
THAT
THEY
DECIDED
TO
SHOW
THE
PENGUINS
AND
DEVILS
AGAIN
ON
THURSDAY
NIGHT
BEING
THAT
BOTH
OF
THE
FIRST
TWO
GAMES
WERE
DOMINATED
BY
PITT
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THEY
WOULD
SHOW
A
DIFFERENT
GAME
THIS
IS
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
SHOW
OTHER
GAMES
JUST
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
FAIR
EXPOSURE
ALSO
SOME
OF
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
ESPN
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
SHOW
CAMPBELL
CONFERENCE
GAMES
REGULARLY
IN
THE
FIRST
TWO
ROUNDS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
ARE
ONLY
GOING
TO
SHOW
CAMPBELL
GAMES
IN
THE
FIRST
TWO
ROUNDS
AS
THOSE
SERIES
WEAR
ON
GAMES
OR
PERHAPS
GAMES
ALSO
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
INFO
ON
ABC
COVERAGE
FOR
THIS
SUNDAY
ESPN
HAD
AN
ADVERTISE
FOR
PENSDEVILS
GAME
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
HELL
THEY
ARE
TRYING
TO
DO
ESPECIALLY
AGAINST
NFL
DRAFT
WELL
I
GUESS
THERE
GOES
THE
NHL
RATINGS
FOR
SUNDAYS
GAME
