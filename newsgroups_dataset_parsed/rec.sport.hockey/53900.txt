GERMAN
AUDIENCE
IS
LUNATIC
IN

GOLFPHOENIXOULUFI
JOUKO
KYLMAOJA
WROTE
I
WATCHED
THE
GAME
GERMANYCZECHS
IN
WC
TODAYAND
I
WAS
ASTONISHED
ABOUT
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THE
GERMAN
AUDIENCE
THE
GERMAN
TEAM
GOT
A
FEW
PENALTIES
IN
THE
LAST
PERIOD
AND
THE
CROWD
WENT
GRAZY
THEY
THREW
COINS
EXTRA
PUCKS
AND
OTHER
TRASH
INTO
THE
RINKIS
THAT
STUPID
OR
WHAT
I
GUESS
THE
CANADIAN
REFEREE
ONE
OF
THE
ISOSTARBROS
GAVE
THE
GERMAN
TEAM
A
PENALTY
FOR
THAT
BUT
IT
DIDNT
HELP
MUCH
I
GUESS
THE
GERMANS
JUST
ARE
PROUD
OVER
THEIR
NAZIKILLEMALLEVERYONE
BUTUSGERMANSSUCKS
ATTITUDETHEY
JUST
SEEM
TO
HAVE
THAT
KIND
OF
ATTITUDE
IN
EVERY
POSSIBLE
SPORT
REMEMBER
THE
EUROPEAN
CHAMPS
IN
STOCKHOLM
IN
SOCCER
IT
REALLY
PISSES
ME
OFF
I
DO
NOT
MEAN
THAT
EVERY
SINGLE
GERMAN
HAS
THIS
ATTITUDE
THAT
SUCKS
BUT
MOST
OF
THEM
SEEM
TO
DO
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
ANGER
ABOUT
THE
GERMAN
AUDIENCE
I
MEAN
IT
WAS
THE
FINNISH
TEAM
THEY
PLAYED
AND
THEY
WERE
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
RIDICULOUS
PENALTIES
THE
CANADIEN
REF
CALLED
IN
THE
LAST
PERIOD
THE
GERMANS
GOT
A
MATCH
PENALTY
AND
A
MINUTES
MISCONDUCT
FOR
PRACTICALLY
NOTHING
AND
SECONDS
AFTER
THAT
THE
GERMAN
GOALIE
GOT
TWO
MINUTES
FOR
DELAY
OF
GAME
FOR
A
SHOT
THAT
WAS
DEFLECTED
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
CROWD
THE
RESULTING
SKATING
ADVANTAGE
LEAD
TO
THE
DECIDING
GOAL
AT
A
POINT
WHEN
THE
GERMANS
WERE
STARTING
TO
COME
UP
STRONG
I
AM
ALSO
SICK
OF
THE
NATIONALISM
THAT
IS
GOING
ON
IN
GERMAN
SPORTS
EVENTS
IF
YOU
WATCH
FOR
EXAMPLE
A
TENNIS
DAVIS
CUP
MATCH
THE
PLAYERS
ARE
OFTEN
NOT
ABLE
TO
PLAY
FOR
MINUTES
BECAUSE
THE
CROWD
IS
SO
OBNOXIOUS
BUT
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
THAT
THIS
KIND
OF
NATIONALISM
IS
AS
STRONG
OR
EVEN
STRONGER
IN
MOST
OTHER
COUNTRIES
YOU
SHOULD
GO
TO
THE
US
AND
WATCH
THE
WAY
THEY
PRESENT
THE
OLYMPICS
ON
TELEVISION
OR
THE
SOCCER
CROWDS
IN
ENGLAND
OR
THE
FINNISH
SPECTATORS
AT
NORDIC
SKIING
EVENTS
I
MEAN
IT
MAKES
ME
SICK
TO
SEE
ALL
THIS
NATIONALISM
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD
AND
I
WOULD
RATHER
SEE
THE
BEST
TEAMPLAYER
WIN
AND
GET
CHEARED
AT
I
DO
NOT
MIND
IF
MY
FAVORITE
TEAM
LOOSES
TO
SOMEBODY
THAT
IS
BETTER
OR
PLAYS
MORE
ATTRACTIVE
AND
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
THAT
IN
MOST
SPORTS
THE
GERMAN
NATIONAL
SITE
IS
NOT
MY
FAVORITE
TEAM
TO
WATCH
THE
GERMAN
SOCCER
TEAM
IS
BORING
TO
WATCH
FOR
EXAMPLE
BUT
READING
THE
ABOVE
POSTING
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
ON
THE
SAME
LEVEL
AS
THESE
CROWDS
YOU
ARE
CRITICIZING
IT
IS
EASY
TO
TALK
OF
NEARLY
ALL
GERMANS
AS
NAZIS
AND
NATIONALISTS
THATS
THE
KIND
OF
PROPAGANDA
THAT
ALL
ULTRACONSERVATIVE
PEOPLE
USE
AGAINST
GERMANY
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
GREAT
DANGER
OF
REARISING
NATIONALISM
IN
GERMANY
BUT
FROM
MY
EXPERIENCE
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
AT
LEAST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
I
KNOW
ALSO
REGARD
THIS
AS
A
BIG
THREAT
AND
ARE
TRYING
TO
DEMONSTRATE
THIS
ATTITUDE
NOW
WHY
CANT
WE
JUST
LOOK
AT
PEOPLE
AS
HUMAN
BEEINGS
AND
NOT
TRY
TO
PUT
THEM
INTO
DRAWERS
CORRESPONDING
TO
THEIR
NATIONALITY
EG
ALL
RUSSIANS
ARE
COMMUNISTS
ALL
AMERICANS
ARE
CAPITALISTS
ALL
GERMANS
ARE
NAZIS
ALL
FINS
ARE
HANGING
AROUND
BEEING
DRUNK
ON
FERRIES
IN
MY
OPINION
YOUR
COMMENT
SHOWS
THE
NARROWNESS
OF
YOUR
MIND
AND
THAT
YOU
DONT
SEEM
TO
BE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
NAZIS
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THOMAS
THERES
NO
TIME
TO
HATE
BARELY
TIME
TO
WAIT
