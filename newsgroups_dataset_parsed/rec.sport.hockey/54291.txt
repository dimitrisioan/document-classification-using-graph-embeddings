bites
do
the
isles
have
another
defenseman
to
insert
into
the
lineup
besides
pilon
once
again
last
nights
stupid
penalty
put
the
isles
in
a
hole
for
the
remainder
of
regulation
and
minutes
into
overtime
even
though
the
isles
nearly
survived
pilons
blunder
in
regulation
it
was
the
most
inopportune
time
for
a
major
penalty
instead
of
confronting
cote
as
he
came
across
the
blueline
pilon
backed
up
and
swiped
at
cotes
nose
with
his
stick
al
arbour
cant
be
serious
to
think
pilon
is
the
guy
to
have
out
there
with
the
game
on
the
line
i
heard
scott
lachance
is
out
till
later
in
the
series
but
there
must
be
someone
else
bring
back
the
bammer
