JAGR
HAS
A
HIGHER
BUT
FRANCIS
HAS
HAD
MORE
POINTS
AND
TAKE
IT
FROM
AN
INFORMED
OBSERVER
RONNIE
FRANCIS
HAS
HAD
A
MUCH
BETTER
SEASON
THAN
JAROMIR
JAGR
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
TAKE
ANYTHING
AWAY
FROM
JARO
WHO
HAD
A
DECENT
YEAR
ALTHOUGH
IT
DIDNT
LIVE
UP
TO
THE
EXPECTATIONS
OF
SOME
BOWMAN
TENDED
TO
OVERPLAY
FRANCIS
AT
TIMES
BECAUSE
HE
IS
A
BOWMANSTYLE
PLAYER
HE
PLAYS
HARD
AT
ALL
TIMES
DOESNT
DISREGARD
HIS
DEFENSIVE
RESPONSIBILITIES
AND
IS
A
GOOD
LEADER
BOWMAN
REWARDED
HIM
BE
INCREASING
HIS
ICE
TIME
JAGR
CAN
BE
VERY
ARROGANT
AND
JUVENILE
AND
DISPLAY
A
ME
FIRST
ATTITUDE
THIS
RUBBED
BOWMAN
THE
WRONG
WAY
AND
CAUSED
HIM
TO
LOSE
SOME
ICE
TIME
THROUGHOUT
THE
YEAR
FRANCIS
CONSISTENTLY
RECIEVED
MORE
ICE
TIME
THAN
JAGR
ALTHOUHG
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
STATS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
I
AM
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
JAGR
HAD
MORE
POINTS
PER
MINUTE
PLAYED
THAT
FRANCIS
WHEN
YOU
ADD
TO
THAT
JAGRS
BETTER
RATING
I
THINK
IT
BECOMES
EVIDENT
THAT
JAGR
HAD
A
BETTER
SEASON
NOT
THAT
FRANCIS
HAD
A
BAD
ONE
ACTUALLY
WHAT
I
THINK
HAS
BECOME
MORE
EVIDENT
IS
THAT
YOU
ARE
DETERMINED
TO
FLAUNT
YOUR
IGNORANCE
AT
ALL
COST
JAGR
DID
NOT
HAVE
A
BETTER
SEASON
THAN
FRANCIS
TO
SUGGEST
OTHERWISE
IS
AN
INSULT
TO
THOSE
WITH
A
MODICUM
OF
HOCKEY
KNOWLEDGE
SAVE
YOUR
ALMOST
MANIACAL
DEVOTION
TO
THE
ALMIGHTY
PLUSMINUS
IT
IS
THE
MOST
MISLEADING
HOCKEY
STAT
AVAILABLE
UNTIL
THE
NHL
PUBLISHES
A
MORE
USEFUL
QUANTIFIABLE
STATISTIC
INCLUDING
ICE
TIME
PER
GAME
AND
SOME
MEASURE
OF
ITS
QUALITY
IE
IS
THE
PLAYER
PUT
OUT
IN
KEY
SITUATIONS
LIKE
PROTECTING
A
LEAD
LATE
IN
THE
GAME
IS
HE
MATCHED
UP
AGAINST
THE
OTHER
TEAMS
TOP
ONE
OR
TWO
LINES
SHORTHANDED
ETC
I
WOULD
MUCH
RATHER
SEE
THE
DISAPPEAR
ALTOGETHER
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
ITS
DUBIOUS
MERITS
TRUMPETED
BY
THOSE
WITH
LITTLE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
ITS
IMPLICATIONS
THANK
YOU
FOR
POSTING
THIS
AS
THE
PERSON
WHO
FIRST
BROUGHT
UP
THE
FACT
THAT
JAGR
HAS
A
MUCH
HIGHER
THAN
FRANCIS
I
CAN
ASSURE
YOU
THAT
I
BROUGHT
IT
UP
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
ABSURDITY
OF
COMPARISONS
EVEN
ON
THE
SAME
TEAM
I
NEVER
EVER
THOUGHT
THAT
ANYONE
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
JAGRS
HIGHER
ACTUALLY
REFLECTED
BETTER
TWOWAY
PLAY
IN
MY
OPINION
FRANCISS
LOW
IS
PURELY
A
RESULT
OF
HIM
BEING
ASKED
TO
PLAY
AGAINST
OPPONENTS
TOP
SCORERS
AT
ALL
TIMES
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
CAN
CHIP
IN
POINTS
WHILE
NEUTRALIZING
THE
OTHER
TEAMS
TOP
CENTER
IS
A
TESTAMENT
TO
HOW
VALUABLE
HE
IS
EVEN
IF
HIS
SUFFERS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
JAGR
FOR
HOW
BIG
FAST
AND
SKILLED
HE
IS
CANT
EVEN
GET
POINTS
NO
MATTER
HOW
INFLATED
HIS
IS
BY
THE
WAY
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
LIKE
JAGR
HE
MAY
BE
A
LAZY
FLOATER
BUT
HE
TURNS
IT
ON
AT
EXACTLY
THE
RIGHT
TIMES
LIKE
OVERTIME
OF
PLAYOFF
GAMES
