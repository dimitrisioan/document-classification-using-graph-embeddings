youll
have
a
hard
time
selling
any
sport
to
a
community
that
cant
play
it
on
account
of
availability
or
financial
reasons
hockey
is
pretty
much
a
sport
for
the
white
and
well
off
what
is
this
crap
im
only
interested
in
intelligent
discussion
if
you
cant
answer
my
question
just
say
so
can
anyone
else
answer
the
ques
its
not
really
crap
you
know
only
half
crap
from
what
i
understand
its
very
expensive
to
play
hockey
south
of
the
border
actually
its
not
that
cheap
up
hear
either
though
once
you
have
all
the
equipement
its
not
more
than
a
year
actually
i
haven
played
in
about
years
so
i
could
be
off
a
bit
in
the
states
where
ice
time
is
considerably
more
expensive
it
can
cost
over
a
thousand
a
year
compare
this
to
baseball
and
youll
see
that
hockey
is
a
sport
for
the
welltodo
and
this
brings
up
the
fact
that
the
welltodo
in
the
us
are
majority
white
btw
what
was
the
original
question
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
hispanic
communtiy
and
playing
hockey
