WRITES
WITH
THE
KIND
OF
TEAM
MONTREAL
HAS
NOW
THEY
CAN
TAKE
THE
CUP
EASILY
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
THEY
HAVE
RIGHT
NOW
IS
THAT
EVERYONE
IS
TRYING
TO
STEAL
THE
SHOW
AND
PLAY
ALONE
THEY
NEED
SOME
MASSIVE
TEAMWORK
THIS
IS
KNOWN
AS
THE
SAVARD
SYNDROME
AND
WE
ARE
TALKING
DENIS
NOT
SERGE
NO
TEAM
WILL
EVER
WIN
SQUAT
WITH
THE
LIKES
OF
DENIS
SAVARD
IN
THEIR
LINEUP
THEY
COULD
TELL
SAVARD
TO
STAY
HOME
AND
WATCH
THE
GAMES
ON
TV
IF
LIFE
WERE
SO
SIMPLE
SAVARD
HAS
NOT
PLAYED
IN
THREE
OF
THE
LAST
FOUR
GAMES
AND
THEY
ARE
STILL
PLAYING
LIKE
CRAP
MONTREALS
PROBLEMS
RUN
DEEPER
THAN
SAVARD
AND
MOUTON
UNFORTUNATELY
I
HOPE
THEY
CAN
GET
THEIR
ACT
TOGETHER
BEFORE
THE
PLAYOFFS
THE
LINEUP
IN
THEIR
GAME
COMING
UP
AGAINST
PITTSBURGH
IS
SAID
TO
BE
THE
ONE
THEYRE
LIKELY
TO
USE
FOR
THE
PLAYOFFS
LETS
HOPE
THEY
CAN
FORGET
ABOUT
THE
NICE
WEATHER
WERE
HAVING
AND
PLAY
HOCKEY
