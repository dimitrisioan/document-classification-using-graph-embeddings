espn
really
sucks
big
time
so
all
us
hockeyautomobile
racing
fans
all
know
exactly
where
we
stand
espn
delays
the
martinsville
race
by
a
day
for
the
nfl
draft
espn
shows
baseball
instead
of
the
overtime
of
a
nhl
playoff
game
gimme
a
break
guys
does
anyone
know
why
this
race
is
tape
delay
especially
until
monday
is
this
the
weekend
for
the
nfl
draft
if
so
postponing
the
race
for
a
day
is
a
real
slap
in
the
face
for
racing
fans
im
afraid
youre
right
as
usual
as
i
recall
theyve
been
doing
this
ever
since
they
started
covering
the
draft
live
i
wish
they
could
work
out
some
kind
of
a
deal
with
somebody
else
such
as
tnn
to
get
the
race
on
live
but
i
guess
espn
isnt
much
into
sharing
it
also
clarifies
where
auto
racing
stands
on
their
priority
list
as
if
we
didnt
already
know
charlie
shub
cdashcscoloradoedu
or
on
leave
at
the
university
of
iowa
