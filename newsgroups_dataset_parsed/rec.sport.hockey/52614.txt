SUMMARY
IF

PLAYED
LIKE
THIS
EVERY
NIGHT
THEYD
BE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
THIS
YEAR
THE
FLYERS
HIT
EVERYTHING
THAT

THEY
CREATED
SCORING
CHANCE
AFTER
SCORING
CHANCE
THEY
SNUFFED
OUT
EVERYTHING
THAT
THE
LEAFS
TRIED
TO
DO
JASON
BOWEN
MADE
A
GOOD
PLAY
ON
HIS
FIRST
NHL
SHIFT
THAT
ALMOST
CREATED
A
GOAL
HE
HAD
THE
PUCK
IN
THE
TOP
OF
THE
LEFT
OFFENSIVE
CIRCLE
ALL
ALONE
BUT
INSTEAD
OF
TAKING
THE
SHOT
HE
FOUND
BRINDAMOUR
CRASHING
THE
NET
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
A
PERFECT
PASS
AND
A
GOOD
SHOT
ACROSS
DAREN
PUPPAS
BODY
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
GOAL
BUT
PUPPA
MADE
A
GREAT
SAVE
READING
THE
PLAY
GARRY
GALLEY
GAVE
THE
MAPLE
LEAFS
RANKED
POWER
PLAY
THE
FIRST
CHANCE
WHEN
HE
HOOKED
DOUG
GILMOUR
AT
THE
FLYERS
LOWLY
RANKED
PENALTY
KILLING
UNIT
WAS
ALMOST
FLAWLESS
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
AND
SET
THE
TONE
ON
THIS
KILL
THE
MAPLE
LEAFS
GOT
ALMOST
NOTHING
BUT
LONG
UNSCREENED
SHOTS
AND
THE
DEFENSE
SWEPT
AWAY
EVERY
REBOUND
AFTER
THE
POWER
PLAY
THE
FLYERS
GOT
A
GOAL
ON
AN
UGLY
PLAY
ROD
BRINDAMOUR
GAVE
THE
PUCK
TO
GREG
HAWGOOD
AT
THE
RIGHT
POINT
AND
HE
SENT
A
DRIVE
AT
THE
NET
PUPPA
MADE
THE
SAVE
AND
KICKED
THE
REBOUND
RIGHT
INTO
THE
FEET
OF
JOSEF
BERANEK
AND
BOB
ROUSE
WHO
WERE
WRESTLING
IN
THE
SLOT
BERANEK
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
HIS
STICK
ON
THE
PUCK
AND
PUSH
IT
OUT
TO
DINEEN
WHO
WAS
SKATING
INTO
THE
SLOT
FROM
THE
RIGHT
CIRCLE
AND
HE
LIFTED
A
BACKHANDER
OVER
PUPPA
FOR
A
FLYERS
LEAD
AT
THE
FLYERS
KEPT
THE
PRESSURE
ON
AND
PUPPA
WAS
THE
ONLY
LEAF
KEEPING
THE
FLYERS
FROM
BUILDING
ON
THEIR
LEAD
FOR
A
WHILE
EVENTUALLY
THINGS
SETTLED
DOWN
AND
DEFENSE
PREVAILED
EACH
TEAM
GOT
AN
OCCASIONAL
SCORING
CHANCE
BUT
THE
GOALIES
WERE
STRONG
BOWEN
STARTED
GIVING
SOME
LINDROSLIKE
CHECKS
IN
HIS
OWN
CORNERS
THEN
LINDROS
WHO
WAS
LOOKING
TO
AVENGE
A
HIT
FOLIGNO
GAVE
HIM
THOUGHT
HE
HAD
A
CHANCE
TO
EVEN
THE
SCORE
HE
HAD
FOLIGNO
LINED
UP
AT
CENTER
ICE
LEANED
INTO
HIM
AND
RODE
HIM
INTO
THE
CENTER
ICE
BOARDS
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
FOLIGNO
WAS
A
LITTLE
FAR
FROM
THE
BOARDS
AND
MIKE
MISTER
MCGEOUGH
FELT
THAT
IT
WARRANTED
A
BOARDING
CALL
AT
THE
LEAFS
COULDNT
GET
ANYTHING
GOING
ON
THE
POWER
PLAY
AS
THE
FLYERS
WERE
VERY
AGGRESSIVE
FOR
A
CHANGE
ON
THE
KILL
WITH
TIME
RUNNING
OUT
IN
THE
PERIOD
RECCHI
CARRIED
THROUGH
THE
NEUTRAL
ZONE
AND
HANDED
TO
LINDROS
AS
THEY
APPROACHED
THE
LEAFS
BLUE
LINE
THEY
WERE
IN
A
CROWD
WITH
WENDELL
CLARK
AND
JAMIE
MACOUN
LINDROS
TRIED
A
BACKHAND
PASS
TO
RECCHI
THROUGH
THE
FEET
OF
MACOUN
THAT
CONNECTED
TO
RECCHI
BUT
THEN
CLARK
CHECKED
RECCHI
OFF
THE
PUCK
MACOUN
THEN
TRIED
TO
CLEAR
BUT
IT
WAS
WEAK
AND
WENT
RIGHT
TO
MCGILL
WHO
HAD
MANNED
THE
POINT
HE
DROVE
IT
FROM
JUST
INSIDE
THE
BLUE
LINE
MACOUN
GOT
HIS
STICK
ON
IT
AND
DEFLECTED
IT
PAST
HIS
OWN
GOALIE
AT
SHOTS
WERE
FLYERS
IN
THE
PERIOD
THE
FLYERS
FINALLY
GOT
THEIR
FIRST
CHANCE
ON
THE
POWER
PLAY
WHEN
DAVE
ANDREYCHUK
TRIPPED
UP
ROD
BRINDAMOUR
IN
HIS
OFFENSIVE
ZONE
DURING
THE
POWER
PLAY
THE
FLYERS
GOT
CHEATED
A
LITTLE
WHEN
THE
PUCK
POPPED
UP
INTO
THE
AIR
AND
ERIC
GLOVED
IT
DOWN
BUT
MCGEOUGH
THOUGHT
IT
HIT
HIS
STICK
ABOVE
HIS
HEAD
WE
COULD
SEE
FROM
OUR
SEATS
AT
THE
OTHER
END
OF
THE
ICE
THAT
IT
ONLY
HIT
HIS
GLOVE
AND
THE
REPLAY
CONFIRMED
BUT
THE
FACEOFF
WENT
TO
THE
OTHER
END
AS
TIME
WAS
RUNNING
OUT
IN
THE
ADVANTAGE
LINDROS
FOUND
GALLEY
WITH
A
PASS
ACROSS
THE
GOAL
MOUTH
BUT
PUPPA
MADE
THE
SAVE
THE
REBOUND
KICKED
BACK
TO
THE
RIGHT
CORNER
WHERE
RECCHI
PICKED
IT
UP
PASSED
IT
OUT
TO
ERIC
CRASHING
THROUGH
THE

EVERYBODY
WITH
HIS
SLOOOOWBALL
HE
HAD
THE
PUCK
AT
THE
POINT
AND
JUST
TRICKLED
A
PASS
DOWN
THE
SLOT
HE
MADE
ALL
THE
FLYERS
LOOK
SILLY
AS
NOBODY
COULD
GET
A
STICK
ON
IT
AND
IT
GOT
TO
GILMOUR
AT
THE

THE

PICKED
THINGS
UP
OFFENSIVELY
AFTER
THE

OVER
BUT
DIDNT
GET
ANYTHING

SHOTS
WERE
FLYERS
THE
FLYERS
WERE
CONTENT
WITH
THE
GOAL
LEAD
IN
THE
THIRD
PERIOD
AND
THEY
DECIDED
THAT
IF
TOMMY
WANTED
A
SHUTOUT
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
WORK
FOR
IT
A
LITTLE
THE
FLYERS
GOT
MOST
OF
THE

CHANCES
IN
THE
FIRST
OR
SO
MINUTES
OF
THE

A
MAJOR
PENALTY
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
GAME
FOR
THE
FLYERS
THE
HAD
NO
INTEREST
IN
STTING
ON
THE
LEAD
HAWGOOD
GALLEY
AND
BRINDAMOUR
PLAYED
CATCH
UNTIL
HAWGOOD
FOUND
DINEEN
ALL
ALONE
IN
THE
LEFT
CIRCLE
HE
CONTROLLED
THE
PUCK
AND
BLASTED
IT
PAST
PUPPA
AT
THAT
WAS
ALL
THE
FIREWORKS
TOMMY
SODERSTROM
WOULD
NOT
FACE
ANOTHER
SHOT
PUPPA
DID
BUT
KEPT
THE
FLYERS
OFF
THE
BOARD
FLYERS
SHOTS
WERE
FLYERS
IN
THE
PROBABLY
THE
STRONGEST
GAME
IVE
SEEN
FROM
THE
FLYERS
SINCE
THE
ALL
STAR
BREAK
SHUTOUT
NUMBER
FOR
SODERSTROM
ALL
SINCE
TIED
FOR
MOST
IN
THE
NHL
BUT
HES
PLAYED
FEWER
GAMES
THAN
BELFOUR
OR
THE
GOALIE
I
CANT
REMEMBER
THAT
HES
TIED
WITH
NEXT
UP
ITS
THE
WINNIPEG
SELANNES
TUESDAY
NIGHT
IN
WINNIPEG
THE
FLYERS
CANNOT
BE
ELIMINATED
IF
THEY
WIN
BUT
A
LOSS
COUPLED
WITH
AN
ISLANDER
WIN
THAT
NIGHT
IN
WASHINGTON
WOULD
BE
THE
OFFICIAL
END
FLYERS
UP
TO
POINTS
ON
THE
SEASON
IN
GAMES
LAST
YEAR
THEY
HAD
POINTS
IN
GAMES
UNDER
SO
THEY
NEED
AT
LEAST
POINTS
IN
THEIR
LAST
GAMES
TO
IMPROVE
ON
THAT
ONLY
BY
PERCENTAGE
POINTS
UNDER
IN
IS
BETTER
THAN
UNDER
IN
TRAGIC
NUMBER
HOLDS
AT
POINTS
WITH
GAMES
LEFT
THE
TRAGIC
NUMBER
FOR
IS
POINTS
I
WATCHED
THE
RANGERS
BLOW
A
THIRD
PERIOD
LEAD
AT
HOME
TO
LOSE
BEFORE
I
FINISHED
THIS
UP
WHY
POINTS
INSTEAD
OF
WELL
THE
FLYERS
WILL
WIN
THE
TIEBREAKER
IF
THEY
CATCH
THEM
WHEREAS
THE
ISLANDERS
WIN
TIE
BREAKERS
AGAINST
THE
FLYERS
AND
SO
NEED
ONLY
A
TIE
THE
RANGERS
COULD
CRUMBLE
DOWN
THE
STRETCH
AS
THEY
PLAY
THE
DEVILS
THE
PENS
TWICE
THE
FLYERS
AND
FINISH
UP
WITH
GAMES
AGAINST
THE

I
