ALL
THINGS

WRONG
THE

JUST
PUT
ON
AN
EXIBITION
OF
HUSTLE
TEAM
PLAY
AND
CONSISTENT
POUNDING
AND
TOOK
IT
BACK
TO
CALGARY
WITH
THE
SERIES
TIED
AT

EACH
THE
FINAL
SCORE
WAS
WITH
THE
THIRD
GOAL
AN
EMPTYNETTER
AT
OF
THE
THIRD
CONACHER
THIS
IS
NOT
AN
OFFICIAL
GAME
REPORT
JUST
MY
OBSERVATIONS
FROM
THE
STANDS
MELROSE
MADE
A
WISE
DECISION
AND
PUT
STAUBER
BACK
IN
GOAL
ROBB
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
PROVE
AND
HE
DID
IN
STOPPING
OF
WHILE
FACING
A
FIERCE
CALGARY
ATTACK
THERE
WERE
NUMEROUS
HIGHLIGHT
FILM
SAVES
KINGS
THIRD
AND
FOURTH
LINES
ROSE
TO
THE
OCCASION
PLAYING
ROUGH
WHILE
AVOIDING
BAD
PENALTIES
WARREN
RYCHEL
SCORED
THE
GAMEWINNER
EARLY
IN
THE
SECOND
PERIOD
ROOKIE
DEFENSEMAN
ALEXI
ZHITNIK
SCORED
THE
FIRST
FROM
THE
BLUE
LINE
LATE
IN
THE
FIRST
DAVE
TAYLOR
IS
AWESOME
HE
SUFFERED
A
BROKEN
NOSE
PARTWAY
THROUGH
THE
SECOND
PARIOD
CHECKED
FROM
BEHIND
INTO
THE
BOARDS
BY
ROBERTS
WHO
GOT
AND
A
GAME
HE
CAME
BACK
LATE
IN
THE
THIRD
AND
WAS
ON
THE
ICE
WHEN
CONACHER
SCORED
THE
EMPTY
NETTER
ACTUALLY
IT
WAS
IN
THE
THIRD
PERIOD
HIS
RETURN
DID
BRING
A
SPARK
TO
THE
CROWD
AND
TO
THE
PLAYERS
WHO
PLAYED
AWESOME
DEFENSE
IN
THE
THIRD
THE
KINGS
GOTO
GUYS
STILL
ARE
NOT
PRODUCING
NO
GOALS
FROM
KURRI
GRANATO
SANDSTROM
OR
ROBITAILLE
WHO
HAVE
A
TOTAL
OF
POINTS
BETWEEN
THEM
YOU
FORGOT
ABOUT
GRETZKY
IF
ANY
OF
THESE
GUYS
START
SCORING
THE
KINGS
WILL
BE
UNSTOPPABLE
IF
THEY
CONTINUE
THE
GREAT
DEFENSIVE
WORK
AS
WELL
MCCREARY
SUCKS
HE
CALLED
MCSORELY
FOR
HIGH
STICKING
SOMEONE
WHO
WAS
ALREADY
ON
THE
ICE
AND
SANDSTROM
FOR
HIGH
STICKING
WHEN
HE
HIMSELF
WAS
ALREADY
ON
THE
ICE
HE
MISSED
MANY
FLAGRANT
STICK
PENALTIES
INCLUDING
ONE
FROM
FLAME
GOALIE
JEFF
REESE
WHO
FOLLOWED
GRANATO
OUT
TO
ALMOST
THE
BLUE
LINE
WHERE
HE
CROSSCHECKED
HIM
HE
CALLED
THE
GAME
VERY
INCONSISTENTLY
WITH
A
SERIES
OF
TICKYTACK
PENALTIES
IN
THE
FIRST
AND
ALMOST
NONE
IN
THE
THIRD
CANT
THE
NHL
SUPPLY
DECENT
OFFICIATING
I
WAS
SITTING
DIRECTLY
ACROSS
THE
ICE
FROM
RON
AND
NANCY
REAGAN
WHEN
THE
EMPTY
NETTER
WAS
SCORED
NANCY
LEAPT
OUT
OF
HER
SEAT
WITH
BOTH
FISTS
HIGH
IN
THE
AIR
WAY
TO
GO
NANCY
THIS
SERIES
IS
STILL
TOO
CLOSE
TO
CALL
TUESDAYS
GAME
MAY
BE
THE
DECIDING
ONE
I
EXPECT
KING
MIGHT
PUT
VERNON
BACK
IN
EVEN
THOUGH
REESE
HAD
TWO
GOOD
GAMES
IN
LA
REESE
HAS
HISTORICALLY
BEEN
GOOD
IN
LA
THIS
WAS
ONLY
THE
SECOND
TIME
HE
LOST
THERE
THIS
MOVE
WOULD
BE
GOOD
FOR
THE
KINGS
SINCE
VERNON
IS
SUCH
A
SIEVE
I
AM
SURE
THAT
STAUBER
WILL
GET
THE
CALL
FOR
THE
KINGS
STAUBER
WILL
BE
IN
NET
ON
TUESDAY
HOPEFULLY
HE
WILL
PROVIDE
ANOTHER
STELLAR
PERFORMANCE
AND
EARN
THE
NAME
ROBB
STOPPER
STAUBER
THE
FIRSWT
TWO
LINES
OF
THE
KINGS
HAVE
TO
WAKE
UP
WHILE
IT
IS
GREAT
TO
SEE
YOU
CANNOT
DEPEND
ON
PAT
CONACHER
AND
WARREN
RYCHEL
FOR
ALL
OF
YOUR
OFFENSE
I
EXPECT
SANDSTROM
GRANATO
AND
GRETZKY
MIGHT
BE
PUT
BACK
TOGETHER
ON
A
LINE
LIKE
THEY
WERE
EARLY
IN
THE
SEASON
THIS
WOULD
LEAVE
KURRI
CARSON
AND
LUC
AS
THE
SECOND
ON
PAPER
THESE
TWO
LINES
LOOK
POWERFUL
LETS
SEE
IF
THEY
CAN
MAKE
IT
REAL
I
BELIEVE
THIS
IS
HOW
THEY
AREI
KNOW
IT
IS
GRETZKY
AND
SANDSTROM
BUT
HE
HAS
BEEN
PUTTING
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
ON
LEFT
ALSO
THE
CARSON
ROBATAILLE
KURRI
LINE
ONCE
IGNITED
WILL
LIGHT
THE
FIRE
OF
THE
OTHER
LINES
HOPEFULLY
GO
KINGS
DVB
IT
IS
EVIDENT
THAT
THE
SCORING
DROUGHT
IS
GETTING
TO
LUC
AFTER
HIS
SLIGHT
BREAKAWAY
IN
THE
THIRD
I
THINK
HE
WAS
STEAMED
ON
THE
BENCH
THIS
EMOTION
MIGHT
HELP
HIM
BREAK
HIS
STREAK
ALSO
I
HAVE
NOTICED
BLAKE
HAS
HAD
A
FEW
REALLY
GOOD
CHANCES
TO
SCORE
BUT
HAS
FANNED
OR
SHOT
WIDE
IS
THE
INJURY
STILL
AFFECTING
HIM
