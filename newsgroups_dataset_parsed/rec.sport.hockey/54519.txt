scores
does
anyone
know
if
hes
playing
mike
hes
been
out
but
he
isnt
injured
he
played
well
when
he
was
put
into
the
lineup
at
the
end
of
the
season
murray
has
to
sit
somebody
out
though
if
the
red
wings
hadnt
played
as
well
as
they
did
in
the
first
game
he
may
have
been
in
the
second
why
should
murray
juggle
players
when
the
wings
are
dominating
toronto
like
they
are
