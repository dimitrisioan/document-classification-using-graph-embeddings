the
fat

is
about
to
hit
the
first
noteokayhow
about
deficits
the
bs
chances
for
a
comeback
are
now
less
based
on
playoff
format
actually
thats
based
on
the
nhls
history
of
games
the
statstical
odds
of
winning
one
straight
game
two
straight
games
three
straight
games
straight
games
the
odds
of
the
penguins
winning
straight
games
in
the
playoffs
was
of
course
this
doesnt
include
weighted
average
but
the
pens
beating
the
devils
straight
a
weaker
team
along
with
beating
the
rangers
straight
a
much
stronger
team
has
made
the
act
balanced
out
thats
about
right
for
boston
the
odds
of
winning
are
probably
closer
to
with
weighted
average
since
buffalos
record
isnt
as
good
and
boston
has
a
stronger
team
enough
about
my
qba
probabilities
though
its
just
goes
to
prove
anything
is
possible
if
you
integrate
that
to
debbie
gibson
who
do
you
think
gets
the
start
in
game
three
i
hope
it
is
going
to
be
blue
if
the
team
can
rally
around
him
maybe
moog
can
too
moog
gets
about
s
out
of
for
his
performance
from
me
i
give
blue
starts
fuhr
has
been
too
tough
buffalo
caught
a
hot
goaltender
just
in
timei
mean
after
all
buffalo
is
wins
losses
in
their
last
harry
sindens
appearance
outside
of
bs
dressing
room
after
game
was
a
pathetic
site
he
said
something
really
retarded
to
cover
sutters
behindthis
game
is
not
about
winning
or
losing
harrycheck
the
its
very
frustrating
to
lose
and
youve
gotta
say
something
actually
its
not
about
winning
or
losing
it
is
how
you
play
the
game
but
when
the
competition
is
magnified
to
this
level
of
the
people
only
care
about
who
wins
or
loses
schedule
your
team
is
in
the
playoffs
and
about
to
go
on
a
long
summer
vacation
on
sunday
morning
i
think
buffalo
will
win
in
its
not
like
boston
is
getting
blown
away
they
lost
ot
games
with
a
different
bounce
they
could
easily
be
up
harry
and
his
buttkisser
milbury
will
never
admit
that
they
screwed
up
in
a
major
way
when
they
brought
in
one
of
the
dumbest
people
in
the
businessbrian
sutter
sutters
playoff
record
as
the
head
coach
in

speaks
for
itself
the
blues
really
have
a
chance
to
advance
to
the
second
round
this
year
good
point
here
chicagos
in
deep
trouble
tonight
the
hawks
have
a
bad
past
history
of
winning
the

and
losing
