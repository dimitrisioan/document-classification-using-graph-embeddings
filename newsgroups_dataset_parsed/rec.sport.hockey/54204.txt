says
it
was
nice
to
see
espn
show
game
between
the
wings
and
leafs
since
the
cubs
and
astros
got
rained
out
instead
of
showing
another
baseball
game
they
decided
on
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
a
classy
move
by
espn
it
was
a
classy
move
but
it
looks
like
espn
is
going
to
devote
most
of
the
coverage
to
the
pens
on
tuesday
night
they
continued
to
broadcast
the
pendevil
game
even
though
pittsburgh
had
the
game
well
in
control
granted
they
did
show
some
bonus
coverage
of
the
caps
and
isles
but
they
cut
away
from
the
close
game
which
went
into
double
ot
to
update
us
on
the
fifth
goal
of
the
rout
thursday
was
a
good
game
even
if
it
was
the
second
straight
game
between
the
pens
and
devils
imho
they
should
program
some
variety
into
the
telecastsyes
i
know
the
game
shown
on
saturday
is
between
the
bs
and
sabres
probably
throwing
a
bone
to
us
bruin
fans
and
what
about
the
cambell
conference
id
like
to
see
a
game
in
the
norris
or
smythe
why
not
have
back
to
back
nights
of
national
hockey
night
just
a
thought
