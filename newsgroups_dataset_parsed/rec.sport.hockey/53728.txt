i
do
not
have
cable
and
on
the
nights
the
caps
dont
play
i
would
like
to
tune
in
other
games
does
anyone
have
a
list
of
the
radio
stations
which
broadcast
the
games
for
the
nhl
teams
thanks
in
advance
i
can
give
you
a
couple
in
detroit
wjr
will
be
broadcasting
at
least
the
first
couple
of
games
of
the
wingstoronto
series
and
since
they
broadcast
at
watts
you
may
be
able
to
pick
it
up
after
dark
where
you
are
at
the
pittsburgh
penguins
games
used
to
be
broadcast
on
kdka
but
i
dont
know
whether
they
will
be
preempted
by
baseball
and
moved
to
another
station
or
not
you
can
try
those
if
the
local
baseball
teams
arent
playing
at
the
same
time
anyway
randy
kdka
has
first
rights
to
pirates
games

split
probably
in
conflicts
for
penguins
games
which
are
preempted
