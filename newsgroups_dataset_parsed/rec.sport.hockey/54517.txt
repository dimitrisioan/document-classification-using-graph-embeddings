ALI
LEMER
WRITES
IM
NOT
EVEN
GOING
TO
BOTHER
TO
REPLY
TO
YOUR
RANTING
POST
THE
LETTER
IS
ADDRESSED
TO
GARY
BETTMAN
NOT
YOU
HE
CAN
REPLY
AS
HE
WISHES
NOT
SO
YOUR
POST
IS
ADDRESSED
TO
ALL
I
QUOTE
AS
SHE
SAID
THE
LETTER
IS
ADDRESSED
TO
BETTMAN
THE
POST
WHICH
THOUGH
HAVING
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
CONTENT
IS
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
ENTITY
WAS
ADDRESSED
TO
ALL
WHEN
SHE
PUTS
THE
LETTER
IN
THE
MAIL
I
DOUBT
IT
WILL
SAY
TO
ALL
I
FIGURE
SHE
WANTED
TO
LET
PEOPLE
HERE
SEE
WHAT
WAS
IN
IT
SINCE
IT
IS
A
TOPIC
THAT
INTERESTS
A
LOT
OF
FOLKS
HERE
THATS
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
PURPOSE
THAN
SENDING
THE
LETTER
TO
BETTMAN
UNFORTUNATELY
AND
I
GUESS
I
LET
YOU
KNOW
DIDNT
I
YOU
DO
NOT
REPRESENT
A
LARGE
BODY
OF
HOCKEY
FANS
BY
ANY
STANDARD
YOU
CARE
TO
USE
TO
DEFINE
LARGE
PEOPLE
CONSTITUTES
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
TINY
GROUP
OF
FANATICS
AND
IS
IN
NO
WAY
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
A
LARGE
BODY
OF
HOCKEY
FANS
ON
THE
INTERNET
LET
ALONE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
LARGEST
COMPUTER
NETWORKS
IN
THE
WORLD
THE
LARGEST
COMPUTER
NETWORKS
IN
THE
WORLD
PHRASE
IS
A
DEFINITION
OF
THE
INTERNET
NOT
A
GROUP
AS
A
WHOLE
THAT
SHE
CLAIMS
TO
REPRESENT
AS
FOR
THE
BUSINESS
OF
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
IS
LARGE
IT
IS
LARGE
COMPARED
TO
SAY
THE
NUMBER
OF
FOLKS
ON
RSH
WHO
ARE
SENDING
A
LETTER
TO
THANK
HIM
FOR
CHANGING
THE
NAMES
AT
LEAST
TO
THIS
POINT
AND
JUST
FOR
MY
OWN
CURIOSITY
I
THOUGHT
ID
LOOK
UP
THE
OFFICIAL
DEFINITION
OF
LARGE
IN
THE
DICTIONARY
IT
READS
LARGE
HAVING
MORE
THAN
USUAL
POWER
CAPACITY
OR
SCOPE
EXCEEDING
MOST
OTHER
THINGS
OF
LIKE
KIND
IN
QUANTITY
OR
SIZE
NOW
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
MANY
LETTERS
BETTMAN
MAY
HAVE
GOTTEN
ON
THE
ISSUE
OR
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
MAY
HAVE
SIGNED
THEM
PEOPLE
MAY
BE
UP
THERE
THEREBY
VALIDATING
DEFINITION
I
WOULD
ALSO
WAGER
THAT
THE
GEOGRAPHICAL
RANGE
OF
SIGNATURES
IS
QUITE
LARGE
WHICH
WOULD
GIVE
IT
A
LARGE
SCOPE
HE
MIGHT
BE
IMPRESSED
BY
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
LIST
OF
NAMES
WHY
WOULD
HE
BE
IMPRESSED
WITH
THIS
UNLESS
IT
WERE
LARGE
I
AM
OF
COURSE
ASSUMING
THAT
YOU
ACTUALLY
AGREE
WITH
WHAT
YOU
ARE
WRITING
AND
ARE
NOT
SIMPLY
TRYING
TO
BE
A
PAIN
ABOUT
THE
WHOLE
ISSUE
TO
HEAR
YOURSELF
SPEAK
I
PERSONALLY
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
OR
NOT
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
LETTER
I
HAVE
VERY
MIXED
EMOTIONS
ABOUT
IT
I
LIKE
THE
NAMES
AS
THEY
ARE
AND
DONT
THINK
THEY
MAKE
IT
THAT
DIFFICULT
TO
LEARN
THE
GAME
BUT
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
SHRED
OF
VALIDITY
TO
THE
CHANGE
