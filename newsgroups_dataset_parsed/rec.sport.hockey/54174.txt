camera
work
on
televised
games
from
is
it
just
me
or
is
the
camera
work
on
some
of
these
games
really
sad
i
cant
remember
how
many
times
during
the
penguinsdevils
game
they
showed
some
guy
without
the
puck
being
checked
in
the
corner
while
the
puck
was
being
fired
on
goal
in
fact
i
think
they
even
missed
one
goal
completely
because
they
were
showing
two
guys
holding
each
other
in
the
corner
now
the
last
time
i
watched
a
football
game
they
didnt
show
the
lineman
going
at
it
while
the
running
back
turned
the
corner
for
a
touchdown
is
it
just
me
