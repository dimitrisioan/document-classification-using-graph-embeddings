RE
BOWMAN
NEEDS
CREDIT
HOWEVER
BOWMAN
IS
REALLY
NOT
A
MODERN
COACH
AND
PATRICKS
SOLUTION
OF
HAVING
HIM
ONLY
RUN
THE
TEAM
ON
GAME
DAYS
AND
DELEGATE
MOST
OF
THE
DAYTODAY
RESPONSIBITY
TO
THE
ASSISTANTS
IS
A
SHREWD
MANAGERIAL
DECISION
ON
PATRICKS
PART
I
WOULD
ARGUE
GERALD
THAT
BOWMAN
IS
THE
FIRST
MODERN
COACH
BOWMANS
CANADIENS
WERE
THE
FIRST
NHL
TEAM
TO
HAVE
A
WEIGHTROOM
IN
THE
HE
IS
THE
FIRST
COACH
I
HAVE
SEEN
THAT
MANIPULATES
THE
PRESS
INTO
SPREADING
FALSE
GAME
PLAN
RUMOURS
DURING
IMPORTANT
GAMES
LISTEN
TO
THE
PREGAME
INTERVIEW
WILL
BOWMAN
AND
COMPARE
THAT
TO
WHAT
IS
ON
THE
ICE
I
AGREE
BOWMAN
IS
A
MASTER
OF
THE
LINEUPS
REMEMBER
LAST
YEAR
IN
THE
SC
WHEN
HE
BENCHED
JAGR
ONLY
TO
SET
HIM
FREE
IN
OT
WHEN
JAGR
BANGED
IN
THE
WINNING
GOAL
I
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
TRADEMARK
BOWMAN
AND
ALSO
A
SIGN
OF
A
MODERN
COACH
I
AM
LEFT
ASKING
WHAT
IS
A
MODERN
COACH
IF
NOT
BOWMAN
JAKE
