amongst
penguins
fans
there
seems
to
be
an
inner
calm
that
ive
never
experienced
before
this
year
with
the
pens
the
players
and
the
fans
have
so
much
confidence
in
the
team
this
year
were
savoring
every
game
and
saving
our
energy
for
the
stanley
cup
thats
a
good
way
to
put
it
its
a
quiet
confidence
i
dont
feel
like
i
have
to
defend
this
team
anymore
the
devils
are
a
puzzle
to
me
they
have
long
been
one
of
the
few
teams
i
always
dreaded
playing
their
d
isnt
quite
what
it
used
to
be
but
they
still
usually
play
us
pretty
tough
i
just
cant
figure
it
out
at
least
last
night
they
mounted
an
attack
watching
some
of
the
devils
players
being
interviewed
i
could
see
in
their
faces
and
eyes
that
they
really
dont
have
any
confidence
they
are
left
speechless
when
asked
what
more
they
can
to
do
to
beat
the
pens
they
act
as
though
they
know
its
a
hopeless
task
bernie
nichols
was
interviewed
after
game
on
the
late
news
he
was
shaking
his
head
in
disbelief
over
barrasso
saying
that
tommy
is
like
another
defenseman
out
there
and
how
difficult
it
is
playing
against
him
then
he
got
this
faraway
look
on
his
face
his
voice
started
trailing
off
and
he
said
it
just
isnt
rightit
just
isnt
fair
and
he
tried
to
muster
a
smile
im
really
impressed
with
bowmans
coaching
tactics
hes
had
an
answer
for
every
move
that
brooks
has
thrown
at
the
pens
as
far
as
coaching
goes
a
pensislanders
matchup
should
be
pretty
good
one
guy
i
feel
sorry
for
in
all
of
this
so
far
is
chris
terreri
im
sure
tom
barrasso
knows
how
he
feels
for
so
long
tommy
would
look
up
and
not
have
a
teammate
in
sight
terreris
teammates
really
left
him
out
in
the
cold
in
the
first
two
games
