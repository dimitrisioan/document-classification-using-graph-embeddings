SWITZERLAND
AT
WHAT
DID
HAPPEN
TO
THE
SWISS
TEAM
LAST
YEAR
THEY
REACHED
THE
SEMIFINAL
AND
NOW
AFTER
MATCHES
NO
POINTS
AND
EVEN
NO
GOALS
AFTER
THE
AGAINST
ITALY
IT
SEEMS
THEY
LOST
ANY
HOPE
AND
WERE
OVERRUN
BY
THE
RUSSIAN
TEAM
NOW
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
WORK
HARD
NOT
TO
BE
RELEGATED
TO
THE
BLEVEL
DOES
ANYBODY
KNOW
IF
THIS
WC
IS
THE
QUALIFICATION
TOURNEMENT
FOR
THE
OLYMPIC
GAMES
IN
LILLEHAMMER
OR
ARE
SOME
TEAMS
ALREADY
QUALIFIED
FOR
THEM
HOPP
