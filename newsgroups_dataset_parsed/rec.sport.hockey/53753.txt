HAVE
THE
GAMES
ESPN
WILL
BE
AIRING
THIS
WEEK
HOPEFULLY
THE
DETROITTORONTO
GAME
TONGIHT
I
THOUGH
ABC
DID
A
DECENT
JOB
BY
GETTING
SOME
FKING
NO
HOCKEY
GAMES
TELEVISED
NATIONALLY
TONIGHT
WHAT
THE
HELL
IS
THIS
WHY
THE
HELL
IS
ESPN
SHOWING
SOME
STUPID
BASEBALL
GAME
WHEN
BASEBALL
IS
NOT
EVEN
THREE
WEEKS
INTO
THE
SEASON
AND
HOCKEY
IS
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
NO
WAIT
I
KNOW
THE
ANSWER
BUT
STILL
IT
REALLY
PISSES
ME
OFF
TO
NO
END
THEY
BETTER
START
PUTTING
SOME
MORE
FCKING
GAMES
ON
OR
THEY
WILL
NEVER
MAKE
ANY
MONEY
OFF
OF
THE
DEAL
THAT
BROUGHT
HOCKEY
BACK
TO
ESPN
AARGH

YOU
OBVIOUSLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
TV
SCHEDULING
WORKS
ESPN
HAD
PRIOR
CONTRACTS
TO
BASEBALL
TO
SHOW
MONDAY
NIGHT
GAMES
AND
HAD
CONTRACTED
ALL
THE
OTHER
BS
SHOWS
WELL
IN
ADVANCE
THE
NHL
TV
DEAL
WAS
VERY
LATE
IN
THE
SCHEDULING
PROCESS
YOU
NORMALLY
HAVE
TO
DO
THIS
ONEPLUS
YEAR
OUT
THE
NHL
PACKAGE
WAS
FINISHED
TWO
WEEKS
BEFORE
THE
SEASON
STARTED
ESPN
HAS
SHOWN
TREMENDOUS
COMMITMENT
TO
THE
NHL
BY
SQUEEZING
IN
EXTRA
TELECASTS
WHEN
IT
COULD
LIKE
THE
LAST
MINNESOTA
GAME
AND
PUTTING
STANLEY
CUP
GAMES
AS
BACKUP
TO
THEIR
BASEBALL
TELECASTS
WHICH
BY
FAVORABLE
CIRCUMSTANCES
THEY
COULD
PULL
OFF
LAST
NIGHT
BUT
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
THAT
ESPN
CANNOT
BREAK
CONTRACTS
AT
WILL
THEY
MUST
HONOR
THE
PREVIOUS
DEALS
THEY
MADE
DOES
HAVE
SOMETHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
RISK
A
LAWSUIT
FOR
BREACH
OF
CONTRACT
WITH
BASEBALL
SO
RELAX
IM
HAPPY
I
DONT
GET
SPORTSCHANNEL
ANYWAY
