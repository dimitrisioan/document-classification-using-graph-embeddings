equip
recommendations
hey
man
having
spent
the
past
season
learning
to
skate
and
having
played
a
couple
of
sessions
of
mock
hockey
im
ready
to
invest
in
hockey
equipment
particularly
since
i
will
be
taking
summer
hockey
lessons
however
i
am
completely
and
profoundly
ignorant
when
it
comes
to
hockey
equipment
ive
checked
out
local
stores
and
looked
at
catalogs
but
i
was
hoping
to
solicit
opinionssuggestions
before
actually
plunking
down
any
money
having
played
football
in
high
school
and
college
i
at
least
have
that
equipment
as
a
basis
for
comparison
but
for
example
what
are
the
advantagesdisadvantages
to
different
kinds
of
shoulder
pads
and
pantsgirdles
are
there
any
notoriously
bad
or
unsafe
brands
or
styles
etc
so
any
suggestions
or
comments
would
be
greatly
appreciated
