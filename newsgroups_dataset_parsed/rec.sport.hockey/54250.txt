WRITES
WHEN
IS
THE
DRAFT
THIS
YEAR
AND
WILL
THERE
BE
ANY
COVERAGE
I
KNOW
THE
UPCOMMING
NFL
DRAFT
IS
ON
ESPN
ANYONE
GOT
THE
DETAILS
PAUL
KARIYA
PICK
NO
PERHAPS
HE
WONT
LAST
LONG
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
EXACT
COVERAGE
IN
THE
STATES
IN
CANADA
IT
IS
COVERED
BY
TSN
SO
MAYBE
ESPN
WILL
GRAB
THEIR
COVERAGE
I
DONT
KNOW
AS
FOR
THE
PICKS
OTTAWA
PICKS
WHICH
MEANS
IT
IS
ALMOST
THAT
ALEXANDER
DAIGLE
WILL
GO
HELL
EITHER
STAY
OR
BE
TRADED
IN
MONTREAL
OR
QUEBEC
IMO
I
WOULD
TAKE
KARIYA
HE
SHOULD
ALOT
OF
LEADERSHIP
IN
THE
NCAA
AND
SO
FAR
IN
THE
WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS
DAIGLE
DIDNT
SHOW
THIS
FOR
HIS
JUNIOR
TEAM
SAN
JOSE
WILL
THEN
GET
KARIYA
TAMPA
BAY
WILL
EITHER
GO
FOR
A
RUSSIAN
KOZLOV
I
THINK
THATS
IT
OR
A
DEFENSEMAN
ROB
NIEDEMEYER
PROBABLY
SPELT
THE
LAST
NAME
WRONG
THE
SHARKS
APPEAR
TO
BE
LEANING
TOWARD
PICKING
ROB
NIEDERMAYER
A
CENTER
HIS
BROTHER
SCOTT
IS
A
DEFENSEMAN
PICKED
BY
NJ
A
COUPLE
YEARS
AGO
THEY
BROUGHT
HIM
IN
FOR
A
PHYSICALTRYOUT
A
WEEK
OR
SO
AGO
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
READ
NIEDERMAYER
IS
THE
BEST
SKATER
IN
THE
DRAFT
PLAYS
BOTH
OFFENSE
AND
DEFENSE
AND
ISNT
AFRAID
OF
PHYSICAL
PLAY
DEFENSIVELY
THE
SHARKS
ARE
LOOKING
PRETTY
GOOD
IN
TERMS
OF
DEFENSE
PROSPECTS
RATHJE
SYKORA
RAGNARSSON
AND
OUR
CENTERS
KISIO
ET
AL
ARE
GETTING
OLD
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
SMALL
PLAYERS
THE
SHARKS
HAVE
I
JUSTS
CANT
SEE
THEM
PICKING
YET
ANOTHER
SMALL
PLAYER
LIKE
KARIYA
HED
JUST
GET
BASHED
BY
THE
OPPPOSITION
AND
GET
A
SEPARATED
SHOULDER
MARK
