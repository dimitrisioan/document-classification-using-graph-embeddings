don
got
his
nickname
grapes
but
im
not
sure
don
use
to
coach
the
boston
bruins
i
dont
know
exactly
when
that
was
could
someone
fill
me
in
on
this
info
i
think
that
the
name
grapes
came
because
as
coach
for
the
bruins
or
in
the
minors
he
used
to
chew
on
grapes
to
keep
from
getting
dehydrated
during
the
games
his
dog
blue
may
have
been
named
cause
he
liked
labatts
beer
anyone
know
about
that
according
to
quotations
from
chairman
cherry
don
was
playing
in
springfield
he
and
another
player
had
to
pay
some
fines
the
other
player
had
his
paid
off
but
not
don
didnt
want
to
don
called
the
other
player
a
teachers
pet
and
the
other
player
replied

accurate
that
is
but
