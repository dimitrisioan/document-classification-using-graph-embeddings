YESTERDAY
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
WATCH
FOUR
GAMESTHE
NJPITT
AT
ON
ABC
LACAL
AT
CBC
BUFFBOS
AT
TSN
AND
FOX
AND
MONQUE
AT
CBC
I
THINK
THAT
IF
EACH
SERIES
GOES
ITS
MAX
I
COULD
BE
WATCHING
HOCKEY
PLAYOFFS
FOR
ODD
CONSECUTIVE
NIGHTS
I
HAVENT
COUNTED
SO
THATS
A
PURE
GUESS
THE
WORST
THING
IS
THAT
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
DID
LAST
YEAR
I
HAD
THE
RANGERS
ON
MSG
AND
THE
TWO
DIFFERENT
GAMES
ON
SCNY
AND
SCA
ON
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
YES
ID
RATHER
HAVE
SC
COVER
IT
JUST
FOR
THE
AMOUNT
OF
COVERAGE
BTW
THOSE
ABC
COMMENTATERS
WERE
GREAT
I
WAS
QUITE
IMPRESSED
THEY
SEEMED
TO
KNOW
THAT
THEIR
AUDIENCE
WASNT
LIKELY
TO
BE
WELLSCHOOLED
IN
HOCKEY
LORE
AND
THEY
DID
AN
EXCELLENT
JOB
THEY
WERE
QUITE
IMPARTIAL
ALSO
IMO
I
THINK
THORNE
EARNS
HIS
MONEY
THE
BEST
PART
IS
THAT
HE
IS
THE
SAME
WAY
WHEN
HE
IS
EARNING
HIS
FROM
SPORTSCHANNEL
AS
THE
DEVILS
ANNOUNCER
IE
UNBIASED
HE
GOES
ORGASMIC
FOR
GOALS
DESPITE
WHICH
TEAM
SCORES
AND
EVEN
MORE
EXCITED
IF
POSSIBLE
FOR
GREAT
SAVES
HE
DID
A
GOOD
JOB
OF
EXPLAINING
CERTAIN
THINGS
TO
NONHOCKEY
TYPES
WITHOUT
OFFENDING
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
FOLLOW
THE
SPORT
UNLIKE

DONT
ANY
OF
YOU
PITTSBURGH
FANS
TELL
ME
HOW
MIKE
LANGE
IS
BETTER
MAYBE
IF
HE
WERE
A
LITTLE
SPONTANEOUS
RATHER
THAN
READING
REHEARSED
LINES
OF
BS
HAVING
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
HOCKEY
HE
WOULD
BE
BETTER
