GREG
BALLENTINE
WRITES
THE
SELKE
CANDIDATE
FORWARDS
MAIN
PURPOSE
ON
A
SHIFT
IS
TO
PREVENT
GOALS
FROM
BEING
SCORED
NOT
TO
SCORE
THEM
WHEN
LEMIEUX
OR
GILMOUR
PLAY
THEIR
NUMBER
ONE
PURPOSE
IS
TO
SCORE
DEFENCE
IS
SECONDARY
ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING
THE
LINE
THAT
PLAYS
AGAINST
THEM
IS
PROBABLY
A
DEFENSIVE
ONE
THAT
IS
WHY
THEY
ARE
NOT
SELKE
CANDIDATES
GAINEY
IS
THE
BEST
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
EVER
I
STAND
BY
THAT
ASSESSMENT
HE
WAS
A
VERY
GOOD
PLAYER
WHO
BELONGS
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
DID
YOU
EVER
WATCH
HIM
PLAY
HE
NEVER
MADE
A
TECHNICAL
ERROR
I
WATCHED
HIM
OVER
HIS
ENTIRE
CAREER
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
PLAYER
AND
THAT
INCLUDES
RUSSELL
COURTNALL
AND
DAVIE
KEON
SCREW
UP
AS
MANY
BREAKAWAYS
AS
BOB
GAINEY
AND
I
WILL
NEVER
FORGET
THE
TIME
DENIS
POTVIN
CAUGHT
GAINEY
WITH
HIS
HEAD
DOWN
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
SOLD
A
BILL
OF
GOODS
ON
BOB
GAINEY
GAINEY
WAS
A
PLUGGER
AND
WHEN
THE
PRESS
RUNS
OUT
OF
THINGS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THE
STARS
ON

THEY
START
TO
