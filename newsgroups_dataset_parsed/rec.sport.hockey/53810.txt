is
reporting
tonight
that
the
detroit
red
wings
beat
the
toronto
maple
leafs
can
someone
who
is
not
part
of
the
media
conspiracy
against
the
leafs
tell
me
how
the
game
really
went
i
am
expecting
a
win
for
the
leafs
shutout
for
potvin
hat
trick
for
andreychuk
and
a
goal
and
assists
for
gilmour
if
the
leafs
really
lost
how
many
penalties
did
whichever
biased
ref
was
at
the
game
have
to
call
against
the
leafs
to
let
the
red
wings
win
ah
yes
california

the
san

report
that
joe
montana
is
rumoured
to
be
the
leading
candidate
to

fired
san
jose
sharks
coach
george
kingston
apparently
montana
is
not
only
coveted
for
his
winning
attitude

be
expected
to
quarterback
the
powerplay
