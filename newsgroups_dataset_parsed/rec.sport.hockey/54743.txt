RE
BLUES
SWEEP
HAWKS
WHILE
I
WILL
FIRST
CONGRATULATE
THE
BLUES
FOR
THEIR
VICTORY
I
THINK
IT
MUST
BE
REALIZED
THAT
THE
PRIMARY
REASON
THE
BLUES
WERE
ABLE
TO
WIN
WAS
CURTIS
JOSEPH
WHEN
A
GOALKEEPER
GETS
HOT
THERE
IS
LITTLE
AN
OPPOSING
TEAM
CAN
DO
JOSEPH
SHOULD
BE
GIVEN
THE
ENTIRE
CITY
OF
ST
LOUIS
BECAUSE
OTHERWISE
THERE
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
A
GAME
SCHEDULED
AS
FOR
THE
GAME
ON
SUNDAY
THE
BLUES
CAUGHT
A
FEW
BREAKS
WITHOUT
A
DOUBT
ONE
WAS
THE
REFEREE
CONSTANTLY
WATCHING
THE
BLACKHAWKS
LOOKING
FOR
REASONS
TO
GIVE
THEM
PENALTIES
SECOND
THE
BLUES
FIRST
GOAL
RESULTED
BECAUSE
THE
PUCK
HIT
THE
LINESMAN
AS
THE
BLACKHAWKS
ATTEMPTED
TO
CLEAR
NO
LINESMAN
NO
SHOT
FOR
BRETTI
CAN
REDIRECT
ANYTHINGHULL
TO
REDIRECT
ON
ANOTHER
OF
ST
LOUIS
GOALS
BELFOUR
WAS
TRIPPED
FROM
BEHIND
AS
HE
WENT
TO
MAKE
THE
SAVE
BY
SOMEONE
WHO
DIDNT
BELONG
IN
THE
CREASE
WHICH
MEANS
IT
WAS
A
ST
LOUIS
PLAYER
FINALLY
THE
OVERTIME
GOAL
WAS
CAUSED
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
KEPT
BELFOUR
FROM
GETTING
BACK
TO
THE
CREASE
NO
GOALIE
NO
WAY
TO
STOP
THE
SHOT
I
CONGRATULATE
ST
LOUIS
FOR
BEATING
THE
HAWKS
IT
WILL
BE
A
SHAME
TO
SEE
BRYAN
MURRAY
FINALLY
ADVANCE
TO
THE
CAMPBELL
CONFERENCE
FINALS
BECAUSE
JOSEPH
WONT
BE
ABLE
TO
STOP
THE
POWERFUL
RED
WING
