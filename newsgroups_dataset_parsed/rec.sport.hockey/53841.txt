RE
THUMBS
UP
TO
ESPN

AGREE
IT
WAS
GREAT
FOR
THE
ESPN
PEOPLE
TO
SHOW
THE
DETROIT
GAME
MY
ROOMMATE
JUST
ABOUT
SHT
WHEN
THEY
THREW
THE
OCTOPUS
ON
THE
ICE
THANKS
FOR
EXPLAINING
THE
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
THAT

THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
I
HAD
WAS
WHEN
THEY
BLOTTED
OUT
THE
LOCAL
COMMENTATORS
WITH
THE
BASEBALL
ADS
AND
MUSIC
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THE
WINGS
PLAYER
HIT
THE
RUT
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
BOARDS
INJURING
HIS
SHOULDER
AND
THEY
BLOTTED
OUT
THE
INJURY
REPORT
OTHER
THEN
THAT
HATS
OFF
TO
ESPN
NOW
IF
THEYLL
ONLY
MAKE
A
HABIT
OF
THIS
