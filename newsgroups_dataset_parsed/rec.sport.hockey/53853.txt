THANKS
FOR
THE
GOALS
BY
STEVE
SMITH
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
MORE
PEOPLE
DONT
BLAME
GRANT
FUHR
FOR
THE
GOAL
THAT
SMITH
PUT
IN
HIS
OWN
NET
ITS
COMMON
TO
PLAY
THE
PUCK
BACK
TO
YOUR
OWN
GOALIE
WHEN
DEEP
IN
YOUR
OWN
END
AND
UNDER
LITTLE
OR
NO
PRESSURE
FROM
THE
OFFENSIVE
TEAM
IF
FUHR
HAD
BEEN
IN
POSITION
THE
PUCK
WOULD
HAVE
NEVER
CROSSED
THE
LINE
MIKE
MCDOWELL
I
HAVE
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
ON
THIS
ONE
IT
IS
ANYTHING
BUT
COMMON
IN
THE
OR
YEARS
I
HAVE
BEEN
WATCHING
HOCKEY
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
THIS
HAPPEN
EVER
I
AM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
LEAGUE
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
WATCHING
ANYONE
ELSE
AGREE
WITH
THIS
YES
COLIN
I
HAVE
TO
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
IVE
PUT
THE
PUCK
IN
MY
OWN
NET
THE
SAME
WAY
SMITH
DID
ONLY
ONCE
MIND
YOU
AND
IT
WAS
DEFINITELY
MY
FAULT
IT
IS
NOT
A
COMMON
PLAY
TO
PLAY
THE
PUCK
THE
WAY
THAT
SMITH
DID
LUCKILY
FOR
ME
WHEN
I
DID
IT
IT
WAS
ONLY
A
SCRIMMAGE
CRAIG
