JPCPHILABSPHILIPSCOM
JOHN
P
CURCIO
WRITES
THE
WORST
THING
IS
THAT
THIS
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
I
DID
LAST
YEAR
I
HAD
THE
RANGERS
ON
MSG
AND
THE
TWO
DIFFERENT
GAMES
ON
SCNY
AND
SCA
ON
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
YES
ID
RATHER
HAVE
SC
COVER
IT
JUST
FOR
THE
AMOUNT
OF
COVERAGE
SO
THIS
YEAR
YOU
HAD
A
GAME
ON
SCNY
A
GAME
ON
SCA
A
GAME
ON
ESPN
AND
IF
THE
RANGERS
HADNT
CRASHED
AND
BURNED
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
A
GAME
ON
MSG
WHAT
ARE
YOU
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
I
SEEM
TO
RECALL
LAST
YEAR
EVERYONE
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
SC
COVERAGE
I
EVEN
REMEMBER
ORIOLES
GAMES
BEING
SHOWN
IN
THE
DC
AREA
INSTEAD
OF
HOCKEY
AND
WHAT
ABOUT
WHEN
SC
FAILED
TO
SHOW
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
OTHER
GAMES
BECAUSE
ITS
FEATURE
GAME
WAS
OVER
SOUND
FAMILIAR
THIS
YEAR
IM
GETTING
TWICE
THE
COVERAGE
I
CAN
SEE
ALL
THE
CAPS
GAMES
PLUS
THE
GAMES
ESPN
SHOWS
I
THINK
ITS
GREAT
THAT
HOCKEY
IS
BACK
ON
ESPN
IMHO
THEYRE
DOING
A
GREAT
JOB
ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING
THE
BASEBALL
CONTRACT
THEY
HAVE
TO
WORK
AROUND
