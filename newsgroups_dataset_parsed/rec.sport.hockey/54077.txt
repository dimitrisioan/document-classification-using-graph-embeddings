the
islandercapitals

tear
down
and
throw
on
my
jersey
hunter
scores

go
ape
shit
cause
this
is
the
first
caps
game
ive
been
able
to
watch
all
season

what
does
espn
do
they
go
back
to
the

that
nj
hasnt
a
chance
in
hell
of

next

the
periodwhat

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggggggggg
oh

the
score

now
penguins
switch
games
you
holy
shit
theyre
changing
games
its
about
goddamned
time
lets
see
if
theyll
stay
later
i
think
this
proves
by
point
the
caps
game
goes
into
overtime
but
due
to
contractual
obligations
they
have
to
switch
to
the
fucking
baseball
sorry
for
my
language
but
im
pissed
what
the
hell
were
they
going
to
do
if
their
scheduled
game
went
into
overtime
espn
get
your
head
out
of
your
ass
now
i
know
there
are
a
lot
first
of
all
i
think
when
espn
covers
the
game
they
do
a
wonderful
job
but
last
night
i
felt
the
same
way
i
really
hate
watching
devilspens
game
everyone
knows
that
devils
are
going
to
get
their
ass
kicked
why
even
bother
showing
them
i
was
so
bored
and
these
espn
people
dont
seem
to
have
any
brain
after
the
sundays
and
last
night
games
they
are
still
going
to
show
devilspens
on
thu
and
sun
what
the
hell
are
they
thinking
about
i
think
if
they
keep
it
up
like
this
nhl
will
never
get
a
major
network
contract
id
rather
see
capsisls
game
which
is
more
exciting
now
i
just
hope
all
baseball
games
are
rained
out
on
espn
so
atleast
we
can
get
diffrent
hockey
games
experience
is
what
makes
a
person
make
new
mistakes
instead
of
old
one
