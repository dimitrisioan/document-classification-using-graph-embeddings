RE
DIV
AND
CONF
NAMES
IN
JWODZIADLITEUUCP
JOHN
WODZIAK
WRITES
SORRY
ROGER
BUT
MR
BASKETBAL
SHOULD
WHAT
HE
REALLY
MEANS
HERE
IE
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
SAID
THAT
HE
HOPES
FANS
IN
THE
AMERICAN
SOUTHEAST
CAN
FOLLOW
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
DIVISIONS
THE
ODDS
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
OTHER
THAN
THOSE
WHO
ARE
DISPLACED
NOTHERNERS
WHO
ARE
PROBABLY
ALREADY
FANS
IS
ON
THE
ORDER
OF
THE
PROVERBIAL
SNOWBALLS
IN
HELL
I
AM
NOT
AT
ALL
CLEAR
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
SAY
HERE
IF
YOU
ASKED
SOMONE
WHO
HAD
NEVER
HEARD
OF
HOCKEY
BEFORE
IF
LA
PLAYED
IN
THE
SMYTHE
DIVISION
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
THE
RESPONSE
WOULD
BE
WHAT
IF
YOU
ASKED
THIS
PERSON
IF
LA
PLAYED
IN
THE
WEST
DIVISION
THE
NAMING
OF
DIVISIONS
AFTER
LONGDEAD
ENTREPRENEURS
IS
UNNECESSARY
OBFUSCATION
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
THE
NAMES
ARE
BEING
CHANGED
FOR
ANOTHER
REASON
THE
NAMES
PATRICK
SMYTHE
NORRIS
ADAMS
AND
CAMPBELL
ARE
ALL
THE
NAMES
OF
SOCALLED
BUILDERS
OF
THE
GAME
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
THINKING
THAT
PUT
STEIN
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
THIS
IS
ABSOLUTE
NONSENSE
THE
REAL
BUILDERS
OF
THE
GAME
ARE
RICHARD
MORENZ
HOWE
CONACHER
ORR
ETC
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
NAME
THE
DIVISIONS
AFTER
PEOPLE
AT
LEAST
NAME
THE
DIVISIONS
AFTER
PEOPLE
WHO
DESERVE
IT
YES
THESE
PEOPLE
DESERVE
RECOGNIGTION
AS
HOCKEY
GREATS
BUT
THE
OLD
DIVISION
NAMES
TOOK
INTO
ACCOUNT
MESSERS
PATRICK
NORRIS
SMYTHE
AND
THE
PRINCE
WHO
HAD
ALOT
MORE
TO
DO
WITH
THE
ORIGINS
OF
THE
LEAGUE
THAN
PEOPLE
WHO
CAME
INTO
AN
ALREADY
ESTABLISHED
SITUATION
IT
IS
MUCH
EASIER
TO
BE
AN
ELEMENT
OF
CHANGE
HARDLY
THE
ESTABLISHED
SITUATION
EXISTED
PRIOR
TO
SMYTHE
ET
AL
THE
STANLEY
CUP
WAS
A
CHALLENGE
TROPHY
UP
FOR
GRABS
TO
WHATEVER
TEAM
COULD
SUCCESSFULLY
MOUNT
THE
CHALLENGE
WHAT
OUR
DEAR
FOUNDERS
DID
WAS
FORMALIZE
THE
CHALLENGE
THEY
CREATED
A
CLOSED
LEAGUE
AN
OLIGOP
OLISTIC
PROFESSIONAL
SYSTEM
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
MAKING
MONEY
WHETH
ER
OR
NOT
THAT
SYSTEM
HAS
CONTRIBUTED
TO
BETTER
HOCKEY
IS
CERTAINLY
DEBATABLE
WE
ARE
HOWEVER
STUCK
WITH
THEIR
INVENTION
AND
THAT
DE
BATE
IS
ACADEMIC
THE
POINT
TO
BE
MADE
HOWEVER
IS
THAT
PEOPLE
PLAYED
HOCKEY
AND
PEOPLE
ENJOYED
WATCHING
HOCKEY
LONG
BEFORE
SMYTHE
AND
HIS
PALS
SHOWED
UP
OR
A
STANDOUT
IN
AN
EXISTING
SITUATION
THAN
IT
IS
TO
BE
SOMEONE
WHO
CREATES
A
NEW
SITUATION
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
HONOR
PLAYERS
LIKE
BOBBY
ORR
THAN
IM
SURE
YOU
CAN
FIND
A
REASON
TO
NAME
A
TORPHY
AFTER
HIM
SUCH
AS
BEST
OFFENSIVE
DEFENSEMAN
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
BEST
DEFENCEMAN
PERIOD
WAS
THERE
EVER
A
BETTER
DEFENCEMAN
WAS
THERE
EVER
A
BETTER
PLAYER
AND
IF
YOU
THINK
THAT
BRUCE
NORRIS
CONTRIBUTION
WAS
SOMEHOW
MORE
SIGNIFICANT
THAN
BOBBY
ORRS
THEN
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
EDUCATION
WHY
DONT
YOU
TAKE
A
POLL
AND
FIND
OUT
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
KNOW
WHO
NORRIS
WAS
BUT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
DO
YOU
NO
I
CANT
FOR
THE
REASONS
I
GAVE
ABOVE
IM
IN
THE
SAME
BOAT
AS
JASON
AND
I
GREW
UP
WITH
THE
CURRENT
DIVISONAL
NAMES
AND
LEARNED
THEM
WHEN
I
WAS
ABOUT
YEARS
OLD
AND
WHO
PLAYED
IN
WHAT
DIVISION
IF
A
YEAR
OLD
AMERICAN
CAN
LEARN
THIS
WHY
WOULD
IT
BE
HARD
FOR
AN
OCCASIONAL
FAN
TO
PICK
UP
ON
WHO
PLAYS
IN
WHAT
DIVISION
SO
YOU
DONT
FEEL
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
TO
MAKE
THE
EFFORT
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
VANCOUVER
PLAYS
IN
THE
WEST
DIVISION
OR
PACIFIC
OR
WHATEVER
OTHER
INTUITIVELY
UNDERSTANDABLE
MONIKER
IS
CHOSEN
OH
NOW
I
SEE
YOUR
POINT
YOUR
INTENTION
HAS
BEEN
TO
ALERT
US
TO
THE
EROSION
OF
PURITY
ILL
BET
YOU
LIKE
HOCKEY
BECAUSE
ITS
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
PLAYED
BY
WHITES
OF
EUROPEAN
EXTRACTION
PROBABLY
NOT
IN
MY
CASE
IM
SURE
OF
THIS
WHAT
YOU
SAID
WOULD
BE
LIKE
ME
SAYING
THAT
ALL
MAPLE
LEAFS
FANS
ARE
AS
BIASED
CLOSED
MINDED
IGNORANT
AND
OF
COURSE
YOU
NEATLY
DELETED
JASONS
JINGOISTIC
RANT
ABOUT
THE
GAME
LOSING
ITS
CANADIANIZATION
QUOTING
ME
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
DOES
MORE
TO
ERODE
YOUR
CREDIBILITY
THAN
IT
DOES
MINE
MY
POSITION
IS
CLEARLY
PROGRESSIVE
AND
IS
ANYTHING
BUT
BIASED
CLOSED
MINDED
IG
NORANT
ARROGANT
I
WILL
GRANT
YOU
ARROGANT
AND
MORONIC
AS
YOU
JUST
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
A
DOESNT
LIKE
WHAT
MR
BASKETBALL
IS
DOING
B
VOICES
THEIR
OPINION
AND
C
LIKES
THE
SENERIO
OF
YOU
GOING
TO
ANTARTICA
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
YOU
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
INSULT
THEM
NICE
TRY
JOHN
BUT
FOR
A
FLAME
TO
BE
TRULY
EFFECTIVE
YOU
HAVE
TO
DISPLAY
AT
LEAST
ENOUGH
INTELLIGENCE
TO
EARN
YOUR
TARGETS
RESPECT
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
