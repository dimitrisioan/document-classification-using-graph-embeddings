I
THINK

YOU
ARE
INCORRECT
ROGER
PATRICK
SMYTHE
AND
ADAMS
ALL
PLAYED
OR
COACHED
IN
THE
LEAGUE
BEFORE
BECOMING
FRONT
OFFICE
TYPES
HENCE
THEY
DID
HELP
BUILD
THE
LEAGUE
ALTHOUGH
THEY
WERE
NOT
GREAT
PLAYERS
THEMSELVES
PUNCH
IMLACHS
CONTRIBUTIONS
AS
A
COACH
AND
GM
WERE
FAR
GREATER
THAN
THOSE
OF
THE
ABOVE
COMBINED
SHOULD
WE
NAME
A
DIVISION
OR
TROPHY
AFTER
HIM
SMYTHE
AND
NORRIS
AND
THE
BUNCH
WERE
HONOURED
PURELY
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
POWERFUL
OWNERS
AS
OWNERS
THEY
CERTAINLY
DID
HELP
TO
BUILD
THE
LEAGUE
BUT
WHETHER
THEY
DEVELOPED
THE
GAME
IS
ANOTHER
QUESTION
ALTOGETHER
ARE
WE
GOING
TO
HONOUR
THOSE
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
LEAGUES
EVOLUTION
OR
ARE
WE
GOING
TO
HONOUR
THOSE
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
SPORT
ITSELF
I
AGREE
THAT
A
NAME
IS
A
NAME
IS
A
NAME
AND
IF
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
TROUBLE
WITH
NAMES
THAT
ARE
NOT
EASILY
PROCESSED
BY
THE
FANS
THEN
CHANGING
THEM
TO
NAMES
THAT
ARE
MORE
EASILY
PROCESSED
SEEMS
LIKE
A
REASONABLE
IDEA
IF
WE
CAN
GET
PEOPLE
IN
THE
ARENA
DOOR
BY
BEING
UNCOMPLICATED
THEN
LETS
DO
SO
ONCE
WE
HAVE
THEM
THEY
WILL
REALIZE
WHAT
A
GREAT
GAME
HOCKEY
IS
AND
WE
CAN
THEN
TEACH
THEM
SOMETHING
ABOTU
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
GAME
I
CANT
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
NAMES
CAN
BE
PUT
RATHER
SUCCINCTLY
ALL
OF
THE
AFOREMEN
TIONED
USED
THE
GAME
OF
HOCKEY
TO
MAKE
MONEY
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
A
POCKLINGTON
DIVISION
A
BALLARD
DIVISION
OR
HOW
ABOUT
A
GREEN
DIVISION
NO
I
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
SEE
A
BALLARD
DIVISION
BUT
TO
SAY
THAT
THESE
OWNERS
ARE
ASSHOLES
HENCE
ALL
NHL
MANAGEMENT
PEOPLE
ARE
ASSHOLES
WOULD
BE
FALLACIOUS
CONN
SMYTHE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WAS
A
CLASSY
INDIVIDUAL
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
HEARD
WHAT
HAVE
YOU
HEARD
THE
MAJOR
WAS
THE
DEFINITIVE
LITTLE
ASSHOLE
HE
ORIGINATED
THE
PHRASE
IF
YOU
CANT
BEAT
EM
IN
THE
ALLEY
YOU
CANT
BEAT
EM
ON
THE
ICE
THAT
WAS
HIS
IDEA
OF
HOCKEY
DO
YOU
THINK
BY
CHANCE
THAT
DON
CHERRY
IS
A
CLASSY
INDIVIDUAL
ALSO
ISNT
THE
POINT
OF
PROFESSIONAL
HOCKEY
TO
MAKE
MONEY
FOR
ALL
THOSE
INVOLVED
WHICH
WOULD
INCLUDE
THE
PLAYERS
WHAT
I
THINK
YOU
MIGHT
BE
SAYING
IS
THAT
THE
PLAYERS
HAVE
NOT
MADE
AS
MUCH
MONEY
AS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THEIR
DUE
AND
IT
IS
THE
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
WHAT
MAKE
THE
GAME
GREAT
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
PUT
THEM
ON
THE
ICE
SO
NAMING
DIVISION
AFTER
MANAGEMENT
PEOPLE
RATHER
THAN
PLAYERS
IS
ADDING
INSULT
IN
THE
FORM
OF
LESSER
RECOGNITION
TO
INJURY
LESS
MONEY
THAN
WAS
DESERVED
THE
MONEY
ISSUE
IS
IRRELEVANT
TO
THE
POINT
THAT
WE
WOULD
AGREE
ON
AND
THAT
IS
IT
IS
THE
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
WHAT
MAKE
THE
GAME
GREAT
AND
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
PUT
THEM
ON
THE
ICE
EXACTLY
TRUE
NAMING
DIVISIONS
AND
TROPHIES
AFTER
SMYTHE
AND
THE
BUNCH
IS
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
NEPOTISM
THAT
PUT
STEIN
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
WAS
NONSENSE
CORDIALLY

ALWAYS
