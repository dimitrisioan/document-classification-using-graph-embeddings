re
wirtz
is
a
weenie
from
dean
in
other
tv
news
the
penguins
announced
yesterday
that
they
will
have
fewer
broadcast
tv
games
and
will
have
games
on
some
sort
of
subscription
payperview
system
yuck
this
is
incorrect
this
year
the
pens
had
games
on
free
tv
and
games
on
ppv
next
year
they
will
have
games
on
free
tv
and
on
a
subscription
basis
you
actually
get
more
free
game
than
last
year
and
there
will
be
no
more
radioonly
games
yes
youre
right
after
going
home
and
reading
the
paper
i
got
the
full
details
thats
what
i
get
for
making
a
post
based
on
wduqs
news
i
should
know
by
now
they
get
just
about
every
sports
related
item
wrong
