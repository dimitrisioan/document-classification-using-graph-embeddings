SKATE
I
KNOW
IT
HAPPENED

BUFFALO
BUT
I
CANT
TELL
YOU
AGAINST
WHOM
KRUPP
WAS
DEFENDING
AN
OPPOSING
ATTACKER
CHARGING

FELL
TOWARD
MALARCHUK
AND
TUTTLES
SKATE
CAME
PERILOUSLY
CLOSE
TO
CUTTING
BUT
ACTUALLY
JUST
MISSED
THE
JUGULAR
MALARCHUK
IMMEDIATELY
FELL

THE
ICE
HANDS
AT
HIS

COACH
RICK
DUDLEY
HED
BEEN
SUFFERING
FROM
IT
FOR
OVER
A
DECADE
HE
JUST
WASNT
DIAGNOSED
FOR
IT
UNTIL

DAYS

OCD
SUFFERERS
STOP
DISTINGUISHING
THE
LINE
BETWEEN
REALITY
AND
IMAGINATION
OR
FAIL
TO
ACCEPT
THAT
SOMETHING
THEYVE
CHECKED
IS
OK
NOW
FOR
EXAMPLE
AN
OCD
SUFFERRER
CAN
WASH
HIS
HANDS
OVER
AND
OVER
AND
STILL
THINK
THEYRE
DIRTY
HE
MIGHT
CHECK
THE
OVEN
TEN
TIMES
TO
BE
SURE
ITS
TURNED
OFF
HE
MIGHT
SEE
A
MOVIE
ABOUT
SOMETHING
AND
AUTOMATICALLY
ASSUME
THE
SITUATION
IS
THE
SAME
FOR
HIS
OWN
LIFE
MALARCHUK
HAS
DRAMATICALLY
DECREASED
THE
MEDICINE
HE
TAKES
BUT
STILL
NEEDS
IT
HE
WENT
OFF
IT
THIS
PAST
WINTER
AND
HAD
A
BAD
OCD
EPISODE
AND
I
THINK
WAS
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
FOR
A
COUPLE
DAYS
HE
FELT
IT
SLOWED
HIS
REFLEXES
SO
HE
TRIED
TO
GO
WITHOUT
IN
ANY
EVENT
HE
IS
ALIVE
AND
WELL
AND
LIVING
IN
SAN
DIEGO
WHILE
PLAYING
WITH
THE
