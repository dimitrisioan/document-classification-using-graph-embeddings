while
watching
the
penguinsdevils
game
last
night
i
saw
the
slash
that
barrasso
took
on
the
neck
this
brought
to
mind
the
goaltender
who
had
his
jugular
vein
cut
by
a
skate
i
think
he
was
a
sabre
but
im
not
positive
does
anyone
rememberknow
his
name
what
has
happened
to
him
since
what
about
the
player
whose
skate
cut
the
goalie
name
info
has
this
ever
happened
before
in
a
hockey
game
it
was
clint
malarchuks
neck
cut
by
uwe
krupps
skate
i
know
it
happened
in
buffalo
but
i
cant
tell
you
against
whom
krupp
was
defending
an
opposing
attacker
charging
the
net
it
was
not
krupps
skate
krupp
was
defending
against
steve
tuttle
of
the
blues
they
both
sort
of
tripped
and
fell
toward
malarchuk
and
tuttles
skate
came
perilously
close
to
cutting
but
actually
just
missed
the
jugular
malarchuk
immediately
fell
to
the
ice
hands
at
his
neck
blood
on
the
ice
malarchuk
became
the
fourth
goalie
behind
hasek
puppa
and
draper
after
suffering
from
obsessivecompulsive
disorder
hes
been
playing
in
san
diego
for
former
sabre
coach
rick
dudley
hed
been
suffering
from
it
for
over
a
decade
he
just
wasnt
diagnosed
for
it
until
he
didnt
sleep
for
ten
days
and
decided
to
have
some
alcohol
to
help
him
sleep
unfortunately
hed
just
been
put
on
ulcer
medicine
a
few
days
earlier
its
amazing
he
lasted
as
long
as
he
did
ocd
sufferers
stop
distinguishing
the
line
between
reality
and
imagination
or
fail
to
accept
that
something
theyve
checked
is
ok
now
for
example
an
ocd
sufferrer
can
wash
his
hands
over
and
over
and
still
think
theyre
dirty
he
might
check
the
oven
ten
times
to
be
sure
its
turned
off
he
might
see
a
movie
about
something
and
automatically
assume
the
situation
is
the
same
for
his
own
life
malarchuk
has
dramatically
decreased
the
medicine
he
takes
but
still
needs
it
he
went
off
it
this
past
winter
and
had
a
bad
ocd
episode
and
i
think
was
in
the
hospital
for
a
couple
days
he
felt
it
slowed
his
reflexes
so
he
tried
to
go
without
in
any
event
he
is
alive
and
well
and
living
in
san
diego
while
playing
with
the
gulls
ihl
krupp
is
now
playing
for
the
islanders
after
the
lafontaineturgeon
trade
and
tuttle
is
no
longer
with
the
blues
but
i
dont
know
where
he
is
possibly
in
the
ihl
but
youd
best
ask
a
blues
fan
valerie
hammerl
john
sr
would
lift
pat
over
the
boards
grab
hammerlacsubuffaloedu
his
hand
and
start
running
around
the
outside
faster
and
faster
i
wanted
to
learn
how
to
get
that
feeling
and
the
only
way
was
to
learn
how
to
skate
