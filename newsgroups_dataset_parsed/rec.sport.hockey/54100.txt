ATLANTAS
ABC
AFFILIATE
SUCKS
I
KNEW
DESPITE
THE
LACK
OF
A
FULL
GAME
TELECAST
LAST
WEEK
IT
WAS
STILL
TOO
MUCH
HOCKEY
FOR
ATLANTA
ATLANTAS
ABC
HAS
DECLINED
TO
PICK
UP
ANY
PLAYOFF
GAMES
TILL
AND
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
SHOW
THE
GAMES
ON
AND
THEY
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
SKIP
THE
FIRST
HALF
HOUR
OF
THE
TELECAST
I
KNOW
THIS
IS
STILL
A
BETTER
SITUATION
COMPARED
TO
REST
OF
GEORGIA
ALABAMA
ETC
BUT
IT
IS
STILL
PRETTY
ANNOYING
AT
LEAST
IN
PITTSBURGH
WE
HAD
A
NETWORK
PREEMPTIONCHANNEL
WHICH
SHOWED
ALL
NETWOORK
SHOWS
PREMPTED
BY
THE
LOCAL
AFFILIATE
I
ASKED
THEM
WHAT
THEIR
PROBLEM
WAS
I
TOLD
THEM
THAT
A
LOCAL
RATING
WAS
NOT
THAT
BAD
CONSIDERING
IT
WAS
THE
FIRST
NHL
GAME
SHOWN
AFTER
A
LONG
TIME
WITHOUT
MUCH
PROMOTION
BESIDES
THEIR
SYNDICATED
PROGRAMMING
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
IS
USUALLY
LOW
RATED
SO
WHAT
DID
THEY
HAVE
TO
LOSE
BY
SHOWING
NHL
PLAYOFFS
SHE
TOLD
ME
THAT
THEY
HAD
CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS
I
ASKED
HER
IF
GOLF
WAS
SHOWN
OIN
ABC
WOULD
CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS
COME
IN
THE
WAY
AND
HOW
COME
CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS
DIDNT
COME
IN
THE
WAY
OF
LAST
WEEKS
TELECAST
SHE
THEN
COULDNT
GIVE
ME
A
COHERENT
ANSWER
ALSO
I
ADDED
THAT
ATLANTA
HAD
ONE
OF
THE
HIGHEST
NEUTRAL
SITE
GAME
ATTENDANCES
AND
THAT
THE
DEMOGRAPHICS
WERE
GOOD
I
THINK
ABC
AND
OTHER
NETWORKS
SHOULD
BEGIN
TO
TIE
THEIR
HIGH
RATED
PROGRAMS
LIKE
ROSEANNE
IN
WITH
THIER
SPORTS
PROGRAMMING
I
HOPE
THAT
EVERYONE
IN
ATLANTA
WHO
READS
THIS
BBOARD
CALLS
WSB
AND
COMPLAIN
BITTERLYT
ABOUT
THIS
TELL
THEM
YOU
WILL
STOP
WATCHING
THEIR
NEWS
TELECASTS
SINCE
THEY
SEEM
TO
BE
VERY
UNPROFESSIONAL
IN
HANDLING
THIS
SITUATION
THE
LADY
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
SETTLE
ON
A
SINGLE
REASON
SOMETIMES
THE
REASON
IS
LOW
RATINGS
THEN
ANOTHER
TIME
SHE
SAYS
CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS
