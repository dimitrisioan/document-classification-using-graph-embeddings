BRYAN
MURRAY
HAS
DONE
VERY
LITTLE
AS
GMYZERMAN
FEDOROV
CHEVELDAE
CHAISSON
THE
WHOLE
RUSSIAN
STRATEGY
WAS
A
PRODUCT
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
GMMURRAY
HAS
MADE
A
COUPLE
OF
DECENT
TRADESTHATS
ABOUT
IT
THAT
WOULD
HARDLY
RANK
HIM
AS
THE
BEST
GM
WASNT
PRIMEAU
MURRAYS
FIRST
DECISION
AS
GM
GERALD
THERE
ARE
MANY
TEAMS
IN
THE
NHL
WHO
HAVE
TAKEN
A
LIKING
TO
RUSSIAN
PLAYERS
THE
WHOLE
RUSSIAN
STRATEGY
IS
NOT
SPECIFIC
TO
DETROIT
OR
TO
DEVELLANO
WHO
WAS
GM
BEFORE
MURRAY
WHAT
THE
PREVIOUS
GM
ALSO
DID
WAS
TO
TRADE
AWAY
SEVERAL
PLAYERS
WHO
HAVE
GONE
ON
TO
DO
WELL
WITH
OTHER
TEAMS
MOST
NOTABLY
IN
MY
MEMORY
MURRAY
CRAVEN
WHO
HAD
A
FEW
VERY
GOOD
YEARS
WITH
PHILLY
AFTER
LEAVING
HERE
ALSO
ITS
NOT
THE
VOLUME
OF
TRADES
THAT
WILL
NECESSARILY
IMPROVE
A
TEAM
BUT
THE
QUALITY
OF
THEM
TRADING
ADAM
OATES
FOR
BERNIE
FEDERKO
WAS
JUST
PLAIN
STUPID
EVEN
IF
FEDERKO
USED
TO
BE
A
GREAT
PLAYER
AT
ONE
TIME
MOST
OF
MURRAYS
TRADES
HAVE
WORKED
SIGNIFICANTLY
TO
THE
WINGS
ADVANTAGE
WITH
THOSE
THAT
DIDNT
BEING
SOURED
MAINLY
BY
INJURY
TO
THE
PLAYERS
INVOLVED
SUCH
AS
TROY
CROWDER
WHO
SUFFERED
BACK
PROBLEMS
FROM
WHICH
HE
NEVER
REALLY
RECOVERED
PUT
SCOTTY
BOWMAN
PAT
BURNS
OR
ANY
OF
THE
OTHER
BETTER
COACHES
IN
THE
LEAGUE
BEHIND
THE
BENCH
OF
THIS
DETROIT
TEAM
AND
THEY
COULD
BEAT
ANYBODY
