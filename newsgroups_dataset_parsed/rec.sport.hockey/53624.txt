be
just
a
little
bit
disappointed

i
buzzed
my
friend
because
i
forgot
who
had
scored
mullens
goal
i
said
who
scored
lemieux
two
tocchet
tippett
jagr
the
funny
part
was
i
said
the
jagr
part
nonchalantly
as
he
was
in
the
process
of
scoring
while
i
was
asking
this
question
all
in
all
abcs
coverage
wasnt
bad
on
a
scale
of
i
give
it
about
an
how
were
the
games
in
the
chist
louisla
area
its
nice
that
the
devils
are
starting
out
their
playoffs
on
network
television
too
bad
that
their
playoff
game
has
been
preempted
on
wabcam
for
an
earlyseason
yankees
baseball
game
thats
stupid
id
complain
to
the
television
network
if
i
were
to
even
see
a
pirates
game
on
instead
of
a
penguins
game
at
this
time
of
the
year
i
and
many
other
pittsburghers
would
surely
raise
hell
its
a
win
by
the
texas
rangers
and
theyre
delaying
the
tapedelay
by
another
halfhour
for
the
ballgame
highlights
texas
is
off
to
a
good
start
they
may
pull
it
out
this
year
