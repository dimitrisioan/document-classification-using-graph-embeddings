RACING
FANS
ALL
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHERE
WE
STAND
ESPN
DELAYS
THE
MARTINSVILLE
RACE
BY
A
DAY
FOR
THE
NFL
DRAFT
ESPN
SHOWS
BASEBALL
INSTEAD
OF
THE
OVERTIME
OF
A
NHL
PLAYOFF
GAME
GIMME
A
BREAK
GUYS
WHAT
REALLY
IRRITATED
ME
WAS
THAT
THEY
KEPT
SWITCHING
BACK
AND
FORTH
BETWEEN
BASEBALL
AND
HOCKEY
AFTER
THEY
STATED
THAT
THEY
COULDNT
SHOW
THE
OVERTIME
PERIOD
I
TURNED
BACK
TO
ESPN
AROUND
AND
IT
WAS
HOCKEY
GREAT
I
PULLED
UP
A
CHAIR
AND
WATCHED
THEN
THE
FIRST
OVERTIME
PERIOD
ENDED
AND
THEY
WENT
BACK
TO
BASEBALL
BEFORE
COMING
BACK
TO
HOCKEY
SOMETHING
LIKE
MINUTES
LATER
ARE
THEY
TRYING
TO
ALIENATE
BOTH
HOCKEY
AND
BASEBALL
VIEWERS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AS
FOR
MARTINSVILLE
I
WONDER
WHY
THEY
EVEN
BOTHERED
TO
SIGN
UP
FOR
IT
WHEN
THEY
IT
WAS
NO
SECRET
THAT
IT
COINCIDED
WITH
THE
DRAFT
WHY
NOT
LET
TNN
BROADCAST
IT
