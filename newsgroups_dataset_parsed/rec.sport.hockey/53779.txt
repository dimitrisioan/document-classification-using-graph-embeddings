RE
ABC
COVERAGE
IN
ARTICLE
ANNA
MATYAS
WRITES
I
WAS
SKEPTICAL
BEFORE
THE
GAME
BUT
WAS
PLEASANTLY
SURPRISED
AT
THE
COVERAGE
I
WAS
PARTICULARLY
IMPRESSED
BY
THE
CLOSE
RANGE
CAMERA
COVERAGE
OF
WORK
IN
THE
CORNERS
AND
BEHIND
THE
PLAY
WITHOUT
LOSING
A
BEAT
GETTING
BACK
TO
THE
PUCK
THORNE
IS
GOOD
AND
IVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
A
FAN
OF
CLEMENT
BUT
I
MISS
MIKE
EMRICK
MY
BOYFRIEND
WHO
IS
NOT
A
HOCKEY
FAN
EVEN
LOOKED
UP
AT
ONE
POINT
AND
SAID
THESE
GUYS
ARE
PRETTY
GOOD
ANNOUNCERS
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
GUY
WHO
SAID
THAT
RICK
TOCCHET

LIKE
CHARLES
BRONSON
MOM
I
HAVE
ONE
COMPLAINT
FOR
THE
CAMERAMEN
DOING
THE
JERSEYPITT
SERIES
SHOW
THE
SHOTS
NOT
THE
HITS
ON
MORE
THAN
ONE
OCCASSION
THE
CAMERA
ZOOMED
IN
ON
A
CHECK
ALONG
THE
BOARDS
WHILE
THE
PUCK
WAS
IN
THE
SLOT
THEY
PANNED
BACK
TO
SHOW
THE
REBOUND
MAYBE
