WRITES
OKAY
YOU
HOCKEY
PLAYING
FANSFINATICS
OUT
THERE
IM
LOOKING
OVER
THE
WIDE
RANGE
OF
ALUMINUM
STICKS
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IVE
BEEN
PLAYING
WITH
PIECES
OF
LUMBAR
THAT
SEEM
TO
WEIGH
ALOT
AND
BREAK
AFTER
A
FEW
USES
SO
IM
THINKING
OF
CHANGING
TO
AN
ALUMINUM
SHAFT
SO
WHEN
I
BREAK
THE
BLADE
ALL
I
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
CHANGE
IT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
SUCH
A
WIDE
REANGE
OF
MODELS
AND
SELECTIONS
OUT
THERE
THAT
IM
NOT
CERTAIN
WHICH
TO
CONSIDER
CAN
ANY
OF
YOU
POST
SOME
OF
YOUR
SUGGESTIONS
AND
EXPERIENCES
WITH
THE
ALUMINUM
STICKS
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
MODELS
WHAT
DO
YOU
LIKEDISLIKE
ABOUT
THEM
AND
WHICH
BRANDS
ARE
BEST
IVE
HAD
AND
STILL
HAVE
A
FEW
ALUMINUM
STICKS
I
GOT
MY
FIRST
WHEN
I
WAS
A
CHRISTIAN
AND
BROKE
THE
SHAFT
HALFWAY
THROUGH
THE
SEASON
TWO
YEARS
LATER
I
BOUGHT
ANOTHER
A
CANADIAN
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
NEXT
SEASON
AND
I
STILL
HAVE
IT
I
ALSO
HAVE
AN
EASTON
THAT
A
FRIEND
WAS
GETTING
RID
OFF
AFTER
GIVING
UP
THE
GAME
I
FIND
THAT
EASTON
BLADES
ARE
EASIER
TO
GET
BUT
ALL
BRANDS
OF
BLADES
ARE
PRETTY
WELL
INTERCHANGEABLE
WATCH
OUT
FOR
DRIED
UP
BITS
OF
FIREWOOD
THAT
SOME
STORES
PASS
OFF
AS
BLADES
IN
MY
EXPERIENCES
THE
BLADES
OF
AN
ALUMINUM
BREAK
MORE
OFTEN
THAN
REGULAR
STICKS
BUT
IVE
ONLY
EVER
BROKEN
ONE
ALUMINUM
SHAFT
I
LIKE
ALUMINUM
STICKS
THE
BLADES
ARE
QUICKLY
CHANGED
EVEN
ON
THE
BENCH
IF
YOU
HAVE
TO
ON
THE
DOWNSIDE
THE
SHAFT
WONT
BREAK
IF
YOU
DECIDE
TO
IMPALE
YOURSELF
ON
IT
CIAO
MARK

THIS
IS
BETWEEN
ME
AND
THE
