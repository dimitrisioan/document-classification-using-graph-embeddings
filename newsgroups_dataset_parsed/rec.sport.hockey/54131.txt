BUFFALO
SABRES
CAN
THE
SABRES
WIN
TWO
MORE
GAMES
AGAINST
THE
BRUINS
I
THINK
GAME
THREE
IN
BUFFALO
WILL
BE
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
OF
THE
SERIES
IF
THE
SABRES
LOSE
THAT
GAME
THE
PARTY
WILL
BE
OVER
IT
WILL
BE
HELLO
NEXT
YEAR
THE
KEY
FOR
THE
REMAINING
GAMES
IN
THE
SERIES
WILL
BE
WHETHER
FUHR
CAN
KEEP
UP
HIS
BRILLLIANT
GOALTENDING
AND
IF
MOGILNY
CAN
CONTINUE
SKATE
BY
THE
BRUINS
HE
HAS
SHOWN
DEMONSTRATED
EXCELLENT
SPEED
FINALLY
THE
SABRES
APPEAR
TO
HAVE
SHOWN
UP
FOR
THE
POST
SEASON
