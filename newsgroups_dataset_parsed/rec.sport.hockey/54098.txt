RE
DON
CHERRY
HELP
ME
OUT
HERE
IN
ARTICLE
WILLIAM
K
WILLIS
WRITES
AS
A
PERSON
WHO
HAS
RARELY
EVEN
SEEN
DON
CHERRY
AND
DOESNT
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HIM
I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
IT
IS
JUST
THIS
AREA
PITTSBURGH
OF
THE
USA
THAT
IS
DEPRIVED
OF
HIS
BROADCASTS
OR
WHETHER
HES
A
CANADIAN
THING
ALTOGETHER
SERIOUSLY
WHAT
IS
HE
ALL
ABOUT
I
KNOW
HE
WAS
A
COACH
AT
ONE
TIME
AND
FROM
THE
VOLUME
OF
POSTS
ABOUT
HIM
SOMEONE
SURELY
IS
GETTING
A
STEADY
DIET
OF
HIM
SOMEHOW
BUT
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
DEAL
WITH
HIM
SECONDLY
ARE
THE
COMMENTS
OF
HIS
THAT
I
READ
ABOUT
ON
THE
NET
MERELY
FLAME
BAIT
OR
DO
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
TAKE
HIM
SERIOUSLY
I
GOTTA
TELL
YOU
FROM
WHAT
I
SEE
HE
REALLY
SOUNDS
LIKE
AN
ASS
LET
ME
KNOW
MAYBE
IM
MISSING
SOMETHING
WELL
HERE
IN
DETROIT
WE
GET
TO
SEE
AND
HEAR
DON
CHERRY
QUITE
REGULARLY
THE
DETROIT
AREA
PICKS
UP
HOCKEY
NIGHT
IN
CANADA
FROM
CBC
CH
IN
WINDSOR
WHERE
WE
SEE
DON
CHERRYS
COACHES
CORNER
BETWEEN
PERIODS
WE
ALSO
GET
TO
SEE
DON
CHERRYS
GRAPEVINE
JUST
BEFORE
THE
GAME
THE
GRAPEVINE
IS
A
HOCKEY
TALK
SHOW
WHERE
DON
TALKS
TO
A
PLAYER
OR
COACH
ABOUT
WHAT
ELSE
HOCKEY
ITS
ACTUALLY
A
PRETTY
GOOD
SHOW
AND
DON
ISNT
AS
ANNOYING
AS
HE
IS
ON
COACHES
CORNER
I
THINK
THIS
IS
WERE
DON
GOT
HIS
NICKNAME
GRAPES
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
DON
USE
TO
COACH
THE
BOSTON
BRUINS
I
DONT
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHEN
THAT
WAS
COULD
SOMEONE
FILL
ME
IN
ON
THIS
INFO
A
LOCAL
RADIO
STATION
HERE
IN
DETROIT
WLLZ
TALKS
TO
DON
EVERY
TUESDAY
MORNING
PERSONALLY
IVE
HAD
MY
FILL
OF
DONNY
HE
REALLY
PISSES
ME
OFF
SOMETIMES
DURING
THE
DETROITTORONTO
GAME
MONDAY
NIGHT
ON
CBC
DON
GAVE
HIGH
PRAISE
TO
DOUG
GILMOUR
SAYING
HE
WAS
A
TWOWAY
PLAYER
AND
NOT
JUST
A
DESIGNATED
GOAL
SCORER
AND
THAT
HE
IS
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
PLAYER
IN
THE
GAME
BECAUSE
OF
THAT
THATS
FINE
AND
I
AGREE
THAT
GILMOUR
IS
A
GOOD
TWOWAY
PLAYER
BUT
HE
SAID
THE
EXACT
SAME
THING
ABOUT
YZERMAN
ABOUT
A
MONTH
AGO
ON
A
LOCAL
RADIO
TALK
SHOW
WHAT
GIVES
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
HE
JUST
HAS
A
SET
SPEECH
THAT
HE
CHANGES
WHEN
HE
GOES
FROM
CITY
TO
CITY
DON
CHERRY
I
THINK
INSERT
STAR
PLAYER
NAME
FOR
CITY
THAT
HE
IS
IN
IS
THE
BEST
TWOWAY
PLAYER
IN
THE
LEAGUE
TODAY
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
OTHER
TIMES
CANT
REMEMBER
EXACTLY
WHAT
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
BASICALLY
CHANGED
HIS
OPINIONS
TO
MATCH
THE
AUDIENCE
HE
WAS
TALKING
TO
SOMEONE
HERE
ON
THE
NET
SAID
SOMETHING
ABOUT
HOW
DON
CRITICIZED
MARIO
LEMIEUX
BUT
WHEN
THE
TIME
COMES
FOR
DON
TO
BROADCAST
THE
CUP
PLAYOFFS
FROM
THE
CIVIC
CENTER
YES
I
THINK
THE
PENS
WILL
MAKE
IT
OUT
OF
THE
WALES
CONFERENCE
DON
WILL
APOLOGIZE
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
FOR
HIS
REMARKS
ABOUT
LEMIEUX
IN
MY
OPINION
HE
IS
AN
ASS
AND
I
WONT
CHANGE
MY
OPINION
IF
IM
IN
A
DIFFERENT
CITY
SORRY
IF
THIS
DIDNT
ANSWER
YOUR
QUESTION
BETTER
BUT
I
JUST
HAD
TO
GET
THIS
OFF
MY
CHEST
LAURIE
MARSHALL
WAYNE
