CAST
AN
UNNECESSARY
SHADOW
OVER
WHAT
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
JOYOUS
BLUES
LOCKER
ROOM
INSTEAD
THE
MOOD
WAS
ONE
OF
RELIEF
AND
SOME
DISAPPOINTMENT
ITS
A
SHAME
WE
LET
DOWN
SAID
KEVIN
MILLER
ONE
OF
THREE
BLUES
TO
SCORE
TWO
GOALS
BRENDAN
SHANAHAN
AND
BOB
BASSEN
WERE
THE
OTHERS
THERE
WAS
NO
NEED
FOR
A
LETDOWN
IF
WED
HAVE
KEPT
WORKING
IT
WOULD
HAVE
ENDED
AND
EVERYONE
WOULD
BE
HAPPY
INSTEAD
A
LOT
OF
PLAYERS
WERE
HAPPY
JUST
TO
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
WE
WON
AND
THATS
ALL
THAT
MATTERS
SAID
BRETT
HULL
SCORELESS
AND
FOR
THE
NIGHT
ONCE
WE
GOT
UP
IT
WAS
REALLY
TOUGH
TO
PLAY
SOME
PLAYERS
DIDNT
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
SCORE
WAS
ANNOUNCED
OUR
LINE
DIDNT
QUIT
SAID
RICH
SUTTER
WHO
PLAYED
WITH
BASSEN
AND
MILLER
WE
STILL
HAD
A
GAME
TO
PLAY
YOU
CANT
ALLOW
FIVE
GOALS
LIKE
WE
DID
THATS
NOT
RIGHT
IT
WAS
DISAPPOINTING
TO
SEE
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
BASSEN
WAS
ALMOST
FRANTIC
ON
THE
BENCH
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BLUES
EFFORT
SOMEHOW
HE
MISSED
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
OF
MINNESOTAS
LOSS
I
DIDNT
KNOW
IT
WAS
FINAL
HE
SAID
I
WAS
KIND
OF
LOOKING
AROUND
ON
THE
BENCH
I
DIDNT
REALIZE
IT
WAS
A
FINAL
FOR
SOME
REASON
WERE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
AND
THATS
GREAT
BUT
ITS
A
LITTLE
DISAPPOINTING
TO
PLAY
LIKE
WE
DID
AT
THE
END
THE
LETDOWN
WAS
PRECISELY
THE
REASON
THAT
BERRY
HAD
INSTRUCTED
THE
SCOREBOARD
OPERATORS
TO
KEEP
THE
MINNESOTADETROIT
SCORE
OFF
OF
THE
BOARD
THE
SCORE

TOLD
THEM

DIDNT
WANT

SEE
THE
SCORE
I
DIDNT
WANT
TO
KNOW
THE
SCORE
BERRY
SAID
I
FELT
WE
HAD
TO
WIN
THE
GAME
AND
THATS
THE
APPROACH
WE
TOOK
IF
MINNESOTA
TOOK
A
LEAD
BERRY
FEARED
THE
PRESSURE
OF
HAVING
TO
WIN
MIGHT
BOTHER
THE
BLUES
IF
DETROIT
LED
HE
WORRIED
THE
BLUES
MIGHT
QUIT
UNTIL
THE
ANNOUNCEMENT
THE
BLUES

SPLENDIDLY
