the
postdispatch
staff
at
thursday
night
the
scoreboard
watchers
at
the
arena
began
to
cheer
their
cheer
quickly
turned
into
a
roar
and
finally
the
sellout
crowd
of
rose
as
one
to
rock
the
old
barn
at
oakland
avenue
in
a
salute
to
the
playoffbound
blues
the
scoreboard
had
just
flashed
the

clinched
fourth

and
the
final
playoff
spot
in
the
norris

good
thing
because
the
blues
quit
playing
they
held
a
lead
over
tampa
bay
when
the
detroitminnesota
final
appeared
with
minutes
remaining
in
the
second
period
they
promptly
went
to
sleep
and
barely
held
on
for
a
victory
that
nearly
slipped
away
at
the
buzzer
tampas
bob
beers
tipped
in
a
pass
from
shawn
chambers
but
officiating
supervisor
john
damico
and
video
goal
judge
rich
schweigler
ruled
that
the
shot
had
gone
into
the
net
after
time
had
expired
im
glad
i
didnt
see
it
go
in
at
the
end
blues
coach
bob
berry
said
if
the
goal
had
counted
hed
have
been
more
upset
than
he
was
by
the
blues
disappearance
in
the
final
minutes
holding
on
for
the
victory
and
making
the
playoffs
tempered
berrys
anger
it
wasnt
pretty
at
the
end
he
said
we
played
great
minutes
as
good
as
we
played
all
year
it
slipped
away
at
the
end
it
shouldnt
have
but
it
did
still
the
blues
won
prompting
another
ovation
from
the
crowd
at
games
end
despite
their
shoddy
effort
in
the
third
period
and
all
the
turmoil
this
season
the
blues
still
made
the
playoffs
theyll
meet
the
chicago
blackhawks
in
a
bestofseven
norris
division
semifinal
beginning
at
noon
sunday
at
chicago
stadium
the
blues
finished
the
regularseason
with
a
record
of
for
points
their
fourth
consecutive
season
minnesota
finished
three
points
behind
in
fifth
place
with
a
record
of
for
points
tampa
bay
which
played
spoiler
last
week
by
tying
the
blues
at
tampa
ended
its
first
season
with
a
record
of
for
points
the
poor
finish
cast
an
unnecessary
shadow
over
what
should
have
been
a
joyous
blues
locker
room
instead
the
mood
was
one
of
relief
and
some
disappointment
its
a
shame
we
let
down
said
kevin
miller
one
of
three
blues
to
score
two
goals
brendan
shanahan
and
bob
bassen
were
the
others
there
was
no
need
for
a
letdown
if
wed
have
kept
working
it
would
have
ended
and
everyone
would
be
happy
instead
a
lot
of
players
were
happy
just
to
make
the
playoffs
we
won
and
thats
all
that
matters
said
brett
hull
scoreless
and
for
the
night
once
we
got
up
it
was
really
tough
to
play
some
players
didnt
have
a
problem
just
because
the
score
was
announced
our
line
didnt
quit
said
rich
sutter
who
played
with
bassen
and
miller
we
still
had
a
game
to
play
you
cant
allow
five
goals
like
we
did
thats
not
right
it
was
disappointing
to
see
what
was
going
on
bassen
was
almost
frantic
on
the
bench
because
of
the
blues
effort
somehow
he
missed
the
announcement
of
minnesotas
loss
i
didnt
know
it
was
final
he
said
i
was
kind
of
looking
around
on
the
bench
i
didnt
realize
it
was
a
final
for
some
reason
were
in
the
playoffs
and
thats
great
but
its
a
little
disappointing
to
play
like
we
did
at
the
end
the
letdown
was
precisely
the
reason
that
berry
had
instructed
the
scoreboard
operators
to
keep
the
minnesotadetroit
score
off
of
the
board
the
score
showed
until
it
first
popped
up
with
detroit
leading
in
the
third
period
the
blues
already
led
at
the
time
i
told
them
i
didnt
want
to
see
the
score
i
didnt
want
to
know
the
score
berry
said
i
felt
we
had
to
win
the
game
and
thats
the
approach
we
took
if
minnesota
took
a
lead
berry
feared
the
pressure
of
having
to
win
might
bother
the
blues
if
detroit
led
he
worried
the
blues
might
quit
until
the
announcement
the
blues
played
splendidly
shanahan
got
the
crowd
going
at
of
the
first
period
scoring
his
of
the
season
then
miller
and
bassen
took
charge
late
in
the
period
with
the
teams
playing
four
on
four
miller
broke
in
on
left
wing
deked
defenseman
roman
hamrlik
and
beat
former
blues
goalie
pat
jablonski
with
the
rebound
of
his
own
shot
with
seconds
remaining
in
the
period
then
just
seconds
later
bassen
rifled
a
long
slap
shot
past
jablonski
after
defenseman
rick
zombo
intercepted
a
tampa
pass
in
the
neutral
zone
bassen
made
it
just
seconds
into
the
second
period
scoring
on
the
rebound
of
bret
hedicans
shot
the
goal
gave
him
his
first
twogoal
game
of
the
season
and
reminded
him
of
a
special
friend
last
year
bassen
befriended
young
oliver
mulvihill
who
died
of
a
rare
form
of
cancer
at
age
on
feb
i
was
thinking
of
my
buddy
oliver
bassen
said
hes
in
heaven
now
and
i
know
he
was
watching
i
know
hes
happy
miller
increased
the
blues
lead
to
on
a
breakaway
goal
set
up
by
zombo
at
then
steve
maltais
broke
curtis
josephs
shutout
just
seconds
later
making
it
less
than
a
minute
after
the
north
stars
final
was
announced
tim
bergland
scored
and
cut
the
lead
to
but
shanahan
scored
his
converting
a
pass
from
nelson
emerson
with
seconds
remaining
in
the
second
period
then
it
was
all
lightning
adam
creighton
scored
seconds
into
the
third
period
prompting
berry
to
rest
the
overworked
joseph
guy
hebert
allowed
goals
to
shawn
chambers
and
danton
cole
in
a
span
of
midway
through
the
third
period
the
goals
by
chambers
and
cole
made
shanahans
second
goal
stand
up
as
the
winner
we
