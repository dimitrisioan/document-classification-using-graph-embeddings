ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
IN
JASON
GIBSON
WRITES
I
CAN
LIVE
WITH
THE
OTHER
CHANGES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
EG
THE
PLAYOFF
FORMAT
CHANGE
BUT
THE
CHANGE
TO
THE
DIVISION
AND
CONFERENCE
NAMES
REALLY
ANNOYS
ME
BATMAN
WAS
ON
TSN
LAST
NIGHT
SAYING
THAT
CHANGING
THE
NAMES
WOULD
MAKE
THE
GAME
EASIER
FOR
THE
OCCASIONAL
FAN
TO
FOLLOW
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
SAID
WHAT
HE
MEANT
THAT
CHANGING
THE
NAMES
WILL
MAKE
THE
GAME
EASIER
FOR
AMERICANS
IN
NONHOCKEY
CITIES
TO
FOLLOW
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
TOO
MANY
OF
MY
FRIENDS
WHO
HAD
A
HARD
TIME
FOLLOWING
WHICH
TEAMS
WERE
IN
EACH
DIVISION
EVEN
A
MINIMAL
AMOUNT
OF
EXPOSURE
TO
THE
GAME
ALLOWS
A
PERSON
TO
QUICKLY
PICK
UP
ON
THIS
THERE
IS
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
MAKING
THE
GAME
EASIER
FOR
AMERICANS
TO
FOLLOW
THE
MORE
FANS
THE
MERRIER
AND
EVEN
IF
YOU
DISLIKE
THE
OCCASIONAL
FAN
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
THE
CHANCE
THAT
THESE
FANS
WILL
BECOME
FANATICS
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
THE
NAMES
ARE
BEING
CHANGED
FOR
ANOTHER
REASON
THE
NAMES
PATRICK
SMYTHE
NORRIS
ADAMS
AND
CAMPBELL
ARE
ALL
THE
NAMES
OF
SOCALLED
BUILDERS
OF
THE
GAME
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
THINKING
THAT
PUT
STEIN
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
THIS
IS
ABSOLUTE
NONSENSE
THE
REAL
BUILDERS
OF
THE
GAME
ARE
RICHARD
MORENZ
HOWE
CONACHER
ORR
ETC
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
NAME
THE
DIVISIONS
AFTER
PEOPLE
AT
LEAST
NAME
THE
DIVISIONS
AFTER
PEOPLE
WHO
DESERVE
IT
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
INCORRECT
ROGER
PATRICK
SMYTHE
AND
ADAMS
ALL
PLAYED
OR
COACHED
IN
THE
LEAGUE
BEFORE
BECOMING
FRONT
OFFICE
TYPES
HENCE
THEY
DID
HELP
BUILD
THE
LEAGUE
ALTHOUGH
THEY
WERE
NOT
GREAT
PLAYERS
THEMSELVES
I
AGREE
THAT
A
NAME
IS
A
NAME
IS
A
NAME
AND
IF
SOME
PEOPLE
HAVE
TROUBLE
WITH
NAMES
THAT
ARE
NOT
EASILY
PROCESSED
BY
THE
FANS
THEN
CHANGING
THEM
TO
NAMES
THAT
ARE
MORE
EASILY
PROCESSED
SEEMS
LIKE
A
REASONABLE
IDEA
IF
WE
CAN
GET
PEOPLE
IN
THE
ARENA
DOOR
BY
BEING
UNCOMPLICATED
THEN
LETS
DO
SO
ONCE
WE
HAVE
THEM
THEY
WILL
REALIZE
WHAT
A
GREAT
GAME
HOCKEY
IS
AND
WE
CAN
THEN
TEACH
THEM
SOMETHING
ABOTU
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
GAME
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
NAMES
CAN
BE
PUT
RATHER
SUCCINCTLY
ALL
OF
THE
AFOREMEN
TIONED
USED
THE
GAME
OF
HOCKEY
TO
MAKE
MONEY
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
A
POCKLINGTON
DIVISION
A
BALLARD
DIVISION
OR
HOW
ABOUT
A
GREEN
DIVISION
NO
I
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
SEE
A
BALLARD
DIVISION
BUT
TO
SAY
THAT
THESE
OWNERS
ARE
ASSHOLES
HENCE
ALL
NHL
MANAGEMENT
PEOPLE
ARE
ASSHOLES
WOULD
BE
FALLACIOUS
CONN
SMYTHE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WAS
A
CLASSY
INDIVIDUAL
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
HEARD
ALSO
ISNT
THE
POINT
OF
PROFESSIONAL
HOCKEY
TO
MAKE
MONEY
FOR
ALL
THOSE
INVOLVED
WHICH
WOULD
INCLUDE
THE
PLAYERS
WHAT
I
THINK
YOU
MIGHT
BE
SAYING
IS
THAT
THE
PLAYERS
HAVE
NOT
MADE
AS
MUCH
MONEY
AS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THEIR
DUE
AND
IT
IS
THE
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
WHAT
MAKE
THE
GAME
GREAT
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
PUT
THEM
ON
THE
ICE
SO
NAMING
DIVISION
AFTER
MANAGEMENT
PEOPLE
RATHER
THAN
PLAYERS
IS
ADDING
INSULT
IN
THE
FORM
OF
LESSER
RECOGNITION
TO
INJURY
LESS
MONEY
THAN
WAS
DESERVED
EVAN
PRITCHARD
NUMBER
OR
DEPENDING
ON
THE
