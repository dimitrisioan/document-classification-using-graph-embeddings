RE
BUFFALO
BOSTON
DEFENSE
IM
PERSONALLY
EXPECTING
MOOG
BLUE
PLAYED
FAIRLY
DECENT
ALRIGHT
SPECTACULAR
AT
TIMES
IN
HIS
A
GAME
BUT
MOOG
HAS
THE
EXPERIENCE
WHAT
DID
BLUE
HAVE
GOING
FOR
HIM
NOTHING
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IN
A
TIE
GAME
THE
PRSSURE
IS
THEN
ON
THE
GOAL
TENDER
TO
INSURE
THAT
YOU
KEEP
THE
PUCK
OUT
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
UNTIL
YOUR
TEAM
SCORES
BLUE
DIDNT
FACE
THAT
KIND
OF
PRESSURE
ON
TUESDAY
THE
BRUINS
WILL
COME
OUT
STORMING
THAT
IS
FOR
SURE
I
REALLY
THINK
THAT
THIS
SERIES
IS
UP
TO
BUFFALO
BOSTON
EXCEPT
FOR
TWO
BAD
PASSES
IN
GAME
ONE
REALLY
HASNT
PLAYED
THAT
BAD
AS
A
BELIEVER
IS
STATISTICS
YOU
KNOW
THAT
YOUR
GOING
TO
GET
THE
PUCK
BY
FUHR
SOONER
OR
LATER
JUST
KEEP
SHOOTING
THERE
GAME
PLAN
IS
SOUND
BUT
THEY
NEED
TO
TAKE
THE
LEAD
FIRST
AND
CONTROL
THE
TEMPO
IMHO
