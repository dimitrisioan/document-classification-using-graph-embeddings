WE
WAS

AARGH
PAUL
STEWART
IS
THE
WORST
AND
MOST
BIASED
REF
PRESENTLY
IN
THE
NHL
HE
CALLED
A
TOTAL
OF
PENALTIES
ON
THE
HABS
AND
ONE
ON
THE
NORDIQUES
THE
NORDS
PENALTY
CAME
IN
OT
STEWART
BEING
AN
EXNORDIQUE
HIMSELF
WAS
LOOKING
TO
CALL
PENALTIES
ON
THE
HABS
WHILE
LETTING
THE
NORDS
GET
AWAY
WITH
MURDERWE
WAS
ROBBED
NO
PATRICK
ROY
IS
THE
REASON
THE
GAME
WAS
LOST
AND
RON
HEXTALL
IS
THE
REASON
QUEBEC
WON
EVERYBODY
SAID
IT
WOULD
COME
DOWN
TO
GOALTENDING
THAT
GOALTENDING
WAS
THE
KEY
ETC
ETC
WELL
THE
KEY
DOESNT
QUITE
FIT
IF
YOURE
MONTREAL
THE
DIONNE
PENALTY
WAS
KIND
OF
A
CHEESY
CALL
BUT
LETS
FACE
IT
HE
LITERALLY
LEFT
HIS
FEET
TO
THROW
AN
ELBOW
BLAMING
STEWART
IS
JUST
AN
EXCUSE
TO
AVOID
FACING
THE
FACT
THAT
ROY
ALLOWED
WHAT
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
WORST
GOALS
HE
COULD
POSSIBLY
ALLOW
HE
EVEN
SAW
THE
WHOLE
SHOT
DAMMIT
BESIDES
STEWART
EVENED
THINGS
UP
A
BIT
BY
CALLING
A
QUEBEC
PENALTY
IN
OT
MONTREAL
PLAYED
A
SOLID
GAME
ALTHOUGH
THEY
STILL
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
CLEAR
TRAFFIC
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
THE
LOSS
OF
SCHNEIDER
WILL
HURT
EVEN
MORE
NORMALLY
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
ANY
TEAM
THAT
BLOWS
A
LEAD
WITH
LESS
THAN
FIVE
LET
ALONE
TWO
MINUTES
TO
GO
IN
REGULATION
TIME
IN
A
PLAYOFF
GAME
ESPECIALLY
NEEDS
TO
BE
SMACKED
UPSIDE
THEIR
COLLECTIVE
HEADS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
WAS
A
TEAM
LOSS
ALTHOUGH
KEANE
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
CLEAR
THE
ZONE
JUST
PRIOR
TO
THE
FIRST
QUEBEC
GOAL
ROY
IS
PAID
BIG
MONEY
TO
PLAY
HE
LOOKED
LIKE
A
PLAYER
IN
AN
INDUSTRIAL
LEAGUE
ON
SAKICS
SHOT
DEMERS
SHOULD
START
RACICOT
IN
THE
NEXT
GAME
IF
NOT
THAT
HE
SHOULD
LET
THE
DAMN
TEAM
READ
THE
PAPERS
FOR
THE
NEXT
DAY
OR
TWOAND
MAYBE
THIS
ARTICLE
IF
POSSIBLE
PATRICK
ROY
COLLAPSED
AFTER
LETTING
IN
THE
TIEING
GOAL
HE
WAS
SHAKY
AND
ON
HIS
KNEES
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
NIGHT
THE
WINNING
GOAL
SHOULDNT
HAVE
GONE
IN
I
DIDNT
THINK
THE
WRAPAROUND
WAS
AS
BAD
AS
THE
SECOND
GOAL
I
ALSO
DIDNT
THINK
SCOTT
YOUNG
SHOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
AROUND
THE
DEFENDER
CANT
REMEMBER
WHO
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
BUT
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
IT
SHOULDNT
HAVE
GONE
IN
REGARDLESS
OH
WELL
AT
LEAST
THE
BRUINS
LOST
IN
OT
ALSO
HA
HA
YEP
MOOG
LOOKED
BAD
ON
MOGILNYS
GOAL
WITH
FIVE
SECONDS
LEFT
IN
THE
SECOND
IMO
HOW
ABOUT
NEELY
THOUGH
HOLY
SHIT
WHAT
A
PLAYER
SPEAKING
OF
GREAT
PLAYERS
MANOHMAN
CAN
QUEBEC
SKATE
I
HAVENT
SEEN
A
TEAM
SO
POTENT
ON
THE
RUSH
IN
A
LONG
TIME
WATCHING
THEM
BREAK
OUT
OF
THEIR
ZONE
ESPECIALLY
SUNDIN
IS
A
TREAT
TO
WATCH
THEY
REMIND
ME
OF
THE
RED
ARMY
BUT
I
STILL
HATE
THE
TEAM
ON
THE
REST
OF
THE
GAMES
DIDNT
ST
LOUIS
WINNING
GOAL
COME
ON
A
POWERPLAY
PENALTIES
WILL
COST
CHICAGO
DEARLY
ESPECIALLY
AGAINST
DETROIT
SAME
GOES
FOR
CALGARY
VERY
VERY
UNDISCIPLINED
WHEN
MARTY
MCSORELY
IS
WAVING
GUYS
TO
THE
BENCH
TO
AVOID
FIGHTS
YOU
KNOW
SOMETHINGS
UP
NEW
JERSEY
WAS
OVERMATCHED
TERRERIS
HEROICS
NOTWITHSTANDING
MARIO
IS
UNBELIEVABLE
AND
JAGR
FOR
SOME
REASON
SHOWS
UP
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
BUT
I
HATE
THAT
TEAM
ANYWAY
