STRIPPED

AND

OFF
THE

GOAL
WAS
A
ON
WITH
LINDROS
THE

GOAL
WAS
JUST
A
PUCK
HE
THREW
AT
THE
NET
GOT
A
GOOD
CAROM
AND
IT
ENDED
UP
BEHIND
THE
GOALIE
ON
THE
SECOND
NYLANDER
GOAL
HE
GOT
THREE
WHACKS
AT
THE
PUCK
BEFORE
IT
WENT
IN
THIS
IS
THE
MOST
FRUSTRATING
PART
OF
THE
FLYERS
DEFENSE
TAKE
THE
BODY
AND
IF
THEY
GET
ONE
SHOT
AND
BEAT
YOU
FINE
DONT
GIVE
THEM
ANOTHER
CHANCE
CARKNER
GALLEY
AND
MCGILL
ARE
ALL
TERRIBLE
ABOUT
THIS
ILL
BET
MONEY
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THEM
WAS
THE
CLOSEST
FLYER
TO
THE
PLAY
THATS
ALL
I
HAVE
MY
RADIO
GOT
BAD
AFTER
THAT
AND
I
WAS
LUCKY
TO
KNOW
WHO
IT
WAS
THAT
SCORED
MUCH
LESS
HOW
FROM
WHAT
I
HEARD
ROUSSEL
HAD
A
VERY
STRONG
GAME
AFTER
THE
GAME
GENE
HART
ASKED
BOBBY
TAYLOR
TO
PICK
THE
THREE
STARS
OF
THE
SEASON
RATHER
THAN
OF
THE
GAME
IT
WAS
GARRY
GALLEY
FOR
HIS
CAREER
HIGH
POINT
TOTAL
IM
SURPRISED
THAT
A
FORMER
GOALIE
WOULDNT
LOOK
CLOSER
AT
HIS
DEFENSIVE
PLAY
TOMMY
SODERSTROM
FOR
HIS
TEAM
RECORD
TYING
SHUTOUTS
IN
ONLY
ABOUT
A
SEASON
AND
MARK
RECCHI
FOR
HIS
ALL
TIME
HIGH
TEAM
SINGLE
SEASON
SCORING
MARK
BUT
HERES
THE
ODD
PART
HE
COULDNT
DECIDE
BETWEEN
LINDROS
AND
RECCHI
FOR
NUMBER
IF
HE
PICKS
RECCHI
AS
AFTER
HE
HAD
A
HARD
TIME
CHOOSING
BETWEEN
HIM
AND
LINDROS
DOESNT
THAT
MAKE
LINDROS
WHAT
YOU
WANNA
KNOW
MY
THREE
STARS
OF
THE
SEASON
WELL
SINCE
YOU
ASKED
ERIC
LINDROS
ERIC
DOMINATES
A
GAME
SIMPLY
BY
STEPPING
OUT
ONTO
THE
ICE
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TEAMS
RECORD
WITH
HIM
AND
WITHOUT
HIM
IS
NO
ACCIDENT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
TEAM
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
ALMOST
AS
SUCCESSFUL
WITHOUT
RECCHI
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
THIS
TEAM
IS
SIGNIFICANTLY
BETTER
WITH
ERIC
LINDROS
ON
IT
AND
I
THINK
THAT
HE
WILL
DESERVEDLY
WEAR
THE
C
ON
HIS
JERSEY
NEXT
SEASON
TOMMY
SODERSTROM
SHUTOUTS
WAS
SECOND
IN
THE
LEAGUE
TO
ONLY
ED
BELFOUR
AND
TOMMY
DIDNT
HAVE
A
CHRIS
CHELIOS
BOOO
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM
HE
ALSO
DIDNT
PLAY
A
COMPLETE
SEASON
DUE
TO
HEART
PROBLEMS
SENTIMENTAL
EDGE
HERE
MY
FAMILY
HAS
A
HISTORY
OF
HEART
PROBLEMS
THERES
NO
QUESTION
IN
MY
MIND
THAT
TOMMY
SODERSTROM
IS
THIS
TEAMS
GOALIE
OF
THE
FUTURE
AND
IF
ROUSSEL
COMPLAINS
AGAIN
ABOUT
BEING
NUMBER
LOOK
FOR
HIM
TO
BE
TRADED
WITHIN
YEARS
MARK
RECCHI
AGAIN
YOU
CANT
ARGUE
WITH
AN
ALLTIME
TEAM
HIGH
SINGLE
SEASON
SCORING
MARK
THERE
ARE
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
TEAMS
THAT
DIDNT
HAVE
A
SINGLE
PLAYER
GET
AS
MANY
POINTS
PLUS
MARK
IS
THE
ONLY
FLYER
TO
PLAY
THE
ENTIRE
SEASON
NOT
A
TOUGH
CHOICE
HONORABLE
MENTIONS
ROD
BRINDAMOUR
TOPPED
HIS
SINGLE
SEASON
HIGH
POINT
TOTAL
WHICH
HE
SET
LAST
YEAR
THE
DIFFERENCE
WAS
THAT
HE
WASNT
ON
THE
TOP
LINE
THIS
YEAR
AND
DIDNT
GET
AS
MUCH
PLAYING
TIME
THEN
AGAIN
HE
DIDNT
GET
THE
DEFENSIVE
ATTENTION
THAT
HE
GOT
LAST
YEAR
FROM
THE
OTHER
TEAM
EITHER
DIMTRI
YUSHKEVICH
WAS
THE
TEAMS
MOST
CONSISTENT
DEFENSEMAN
YES
HE
MADE
ROOKIE
MISTAKES
BUT
HE
WAS
USUALLY
FAST
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
UP
FOR
THEM
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THAT
WITH
HIS
SHOT
HELL
SCORE
A
FEW
MORE
POINTS
NEXT
YEAR
WITHOUT
GIVING
UP
ANYTHING
IN
HIS
OWN
ZONE
AND
I
SUSPECT
THAT
HELL
BE
THE
TEAMS
TOP
DEFENSEMAN
IN
YEARS
TO
COME
GARRY
GALLEY
WAS
THE
TEAMS
POINT
LEADER
FROM
DEFENSEMEN
AGAIN
THERE
ARE
SOME
THINGS
YOU
JUST
CANT
ARGUE
WITH
AND
HE
BATTLED
WITH
CHRONIC
FATIGUE
SYNDROME
HE
CERTAINLY
DESERVES
KUDOS
FOR
ONLY
MISSING
ONE
GAME
AND
THAT
WAS
AGAINST
HIS
WISHES
UNDER
DOCTORS
ORDERS
BUT
HIS
DEFENSIVE
PLAY
OFTEN
NEGATES
HIS
OFFENSIVE
CONTRIBUTION
A
LITTLE
MORE
CAUTION
AND
A
LITTLE
BIT
SMARTER
IN
HIS
OWN
END
WILL
MAKE
HIM
A
MUCH
MORE
IMPORTANT
PART
OF
THE
TEAM
NEXT
YEAR
BRENT
FEDYK
WAS
THE
LEAGUES
BIGGEST
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
LAST
YEARS
POINT
TOTAL
BUT
CONSISTENCY
BECAME
A
PROBLEM

HIM
