reference
i

okay
abc
showed
the
kingsflames
fine
yawn
espn
through
a
fortunate
rainout
of
a
baseball
game
showed
the
red
wingstoronto
game
cool
but
i
swear
that
the
advertisements
all
week
long
had
said
that
espn
would
show
pittnj
on
tuesday
and
bosbuff
on
thursday
i
raced
home
from
work
early
pacific
to
catch
the
game
but
alas
it
was
the
bostonbuffalo
game
and
then
they
promised
that
they
would
show
the
pittnj
game
on
thursday
overnight
they
changed
their
mind
rest
deleted
espn
never
committed
and
i
never
saw
advertised
to
a
particular
thursday
game
they
had
originally
scheduled
bosbuf
and
that
was
somehow
leaked
on
this
net
but
to
my
knowledge
espn
never
publicly
released
a
schedule
until
monday
when
they
announced
pittnj
thursday
and
bostonbuffalo
saturday
