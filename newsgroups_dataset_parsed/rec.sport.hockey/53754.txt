west
coast
nhl
playoff
games
us
easterners
who
have
newspapers
with
editors
unsympathetic
to
playoff
pools
often
dont
get
summaries
from
west
coast
games
since
they
finish
too
late
at
night
for
the
morning
edition
i
and
im
sure
others
too
would
greatly
appreciate
it
if
scoring
summaries
of
west
coast
playoff
games
could
be
posted
to
this
group
right
away
basically
all
we
need
are
goal
scorers
and
assists
dont
bother
with
times
penalties
shots
etc
this
would
make
a
lot
of
poolobsessed
people
very
happy
i
guess
with
the
senators
out
golfing
now
the
local
papers
have
lost
interest
thanks
