re
radio
stations
add
bostons
as
the
bruins
flagship
station
you
probably
wont
pick
it
up
anywhere
outside
of
boston
since
its
only
a
watt
station
the
bruins
also
have
network
stations
in
all
new
england
states
this
could
be
the
bruins
last
year
on
eei
which
also
happens
to
be
an
allsports
radio
station
the
problem
is
that
the
bruins
are
not
too
happy
being
moved
over
to
a
different
stationwmex
whenever
there
is
a
the
samenight
conflict
with
the
nbas
boston
celtics
this
happened
times
during
the
course
of
the
regular
seasonthe
celtics
own
financially
troubled
weei
the
bruins
might
resurface
on
whdh
next
year
