GREG

IS
A
GOOD
STAT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
THE
ONLY
STAT
THAT
I
AM
AWARE
OF
THAT
TAKES
INTO
ACCOUNT
DEFENSIVE
PLAY
IT
ISNT
A
MEASURE
OF
DEFENSIVE
PLAY
IT
TAKES
INTO
ACCOUNT
OFFENSE
AND
DEFENCE
ALL
ASPECTS
OF
PLAY
IF
WE
ARE
INTERESTED
OF
REAL
ALLROUND
PLAYERS
THE
POWER
PLAY
STATS
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
TOO
BECAUSE
THE
POWER
PLAY
IS
ALSO
ONE
ASPECT
OF
PLAY
THERE
IS
STILL
SOMETHING
TO
BE
DONE
WITH
THESE
PLAYER
EVALUATION
TOOLS
IMO
ANY
GOOD
PLAYER
SHOULD
SCORE
ON
POWER
PLAYS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
MAN
ADVANTAGE
VERY
GOOD
POWER
PLAY
SCORERS
TEND
TO
BECOME
OVERRATED
BECAUSE
THEIR
POINT
TOTALS
ARE
INFLATED
BY

PLAY
POINTS
TENDS
TO
EXPOSE
THESE
OVERRATED
PLAYERS
SUCH
AS
BRETT
HULL
JOHN
CULLEN
AND
DAVE
ANDREYCHUCK
GIVEN
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
PLAY
POWER
PLAY
CONSISTENTLY
ANY
PLAYER
CAN
INFLATE
HIS
TOTALS
GREGMEISTER
EXCEPT
FOR
VANCOUVER
OF

BURE
HAS
A
HARD

SCORING
ON
