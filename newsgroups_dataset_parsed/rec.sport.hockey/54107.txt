WROTE
UNFORTUNATELY
THAT
IS
THE
WAY
THE
LEAGUE
IS
HEADING
YOU
CANT
FIGHT
SO
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
RETALIATE
AGAINST
SOMEONE
IS
WITH
A
CHEAP
SHOT
WHEN
THE
REF
ISNT
LOOKING
ULF
HAS
BROUGHT
THIS
TO
A
HIGH
LEVEL
PLAYERS
STUCK
IN
THE
PAST
LIKE
NEELY
WHO
PREFER
FIGHTS
TO
CHEAP
SHOTS
ARE
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
IN
THE
NEW
SYSTEM
LETS
FACE
IT
A
CHEAP
SHOT
LIKE
HIGH
STICKING
IS
A
VERY
EFFECTIVE
METHOD
IT
IS
EASIER
TO
HIDE
FROM
THE
REFS
HAS
A
BETTER
CHANCE
OF
CAUSING
INJURY
AND
YOU
CAN
DRAW
PEOPLE
INTO
FIGHTS
THAT
WAY
I
DONT
LIKE
IT
BUT
THATS
THE
WAY
THE
LEAGUE
IS
GOING
BY
THE
WAY
THERE
WAS
A
RATHER
GOOD
HIT
BY
ULF
IN
THE
LAST
PENGUINDEVIL
GAME
MANAGED
TO
HIT
THE
NJ
PLAYER
IN
THE
FACE
WITH
A
STICK
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
A
LEGAL
HIT
AFTER
ALL
ULF
IS
A
CLEAN
PLAYER
AND
IS
ALLOWED
TO
DO
THINGS
LIKE
THAT
ARE
THERE
ANY
EX
NHL
HOCKEY
PLAYERS
OUT
THERE
WHO
MIGHT
CARE
TO
COMMENT
ON
THIS
AND
END
THIS
RIDICULOUSLY
