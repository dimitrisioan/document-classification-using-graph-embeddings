unfortunately
that
is
the
way
the
league
is
heading
you
cant
fight
so
the
only
way
to
retaliate
against
someone
is
with
a
cheap
shot
when
the
ref
isnt
looking
ulf
has
brought
this
to
a
high
level
players
stuck
in
the
past
like
neely
who
prefer
fights
to
cheap
shots
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
new
system
lets
face
it
a
cheap
shot
like
high
sticking
is
a
very
effective
method
it
is
easier
to
hide
from
the
refs
has
a
better
chance
of
causing
injury
and
you
can
draw
people
into
fights
that
way
i
dont
like
it
but
thats
the
way
the
league
is
going
by
the
way
there
was
a
rather
good
hit
by
ulf
in
the
last
penguindevil
game
managed
to
hit
the
nj
player
in
the
face
with
a
stick
must
have
been
a
legal
hit
after
all
ulf
is
a
clean
player
and
is
allowed
to
do
things
like
that
are
there
any
ex
nhl
hockey
players
out
there
who
might
care
to
comment
on
this
and
end
this
ridiculously
long
discussion
