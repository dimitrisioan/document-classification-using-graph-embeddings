and
while
we
are
on
the
subject
has
a
captain
ever
been
traded
resigned
or
been
striped
of
his
title
during
the
season
any
other
team
captain
trivia
would
be
appreciated
wasnt
ron
francis
captain
of
the
whalers
when
he
was
traded
to
pittsburgh
mom
chris
chelios
was
montreals
cocaptain
with
guy
carbonneau
when
he
was
traded
to
chicago
for
denis
savard
and
peter
stastny
was
captain
of
the
quebec
nordiques
when
he
was
traded
to
newjersey
also
mark
messier
was
captain
of
the
edmonton
oilers
when
he
was
traded
to
new
york
how
about
dale
hawerchuk
with
winnipeg
when
he
was
traded
to
buffalo
was
he
captain
too
i
think
so
i
should
not
forget
wayne
you
know
who
when
he
was
traded
to
la
he
was
captain
didnt
they
strip
wendel
clark
of
his
captaincy
in
toronto
buffalo
seems
to
have
started
a
tradition
of
trading
its
captains
pat
lafontaine
was
awarded
the
captaincy
when
mike
ramsey
was
forced
to
give
it
up
ramseys
now
a
penguin
ramsey
inherited
it
from
mike
foligno
whos
now
a
leaf
he
in
turn
had
inherited
it
from
lindy
ruff
who
went
i
forget
where
ruff
had
it
from
perreault
who
retired
so
i
guess
thats
where
the
streak
started
or
did
it
after
all
danny
gare
was
captain
before
him
and
he
went
to
detroit
jim
scoenfeld
gerry
meehan
and
floyd
smith
are
the
others
in
reverse
order
last
to
first
i
was
a
bit
young
at
the
time
so
im
not
sure
of
the
fate
of
schoenfeld
but
he
ultimately
went
to
detroit
and
boston
meehan
went
to
vancouver
atlanta
and
washington
smith
seems
to
have
hung
up
his
skates
after
buffalo
but
i
dont
know
if
the
captaincy
was
removed
before
or
after
that
or
how
many
games
he
played
for
buffalo
this
is
actually
getting
fascinating
captaincy
in
buffalo
is
a
sure
sign
youre
to
be
traded
almost
unless
youre
a
franchise
player
valerie
hammerl
birtday
n
an
event
when
friends
get
hammerlacsubuffaloedu
together
set
your
dessert
on
fire
then
acscvjhubmsccbuffaloedu
laugh
and
sing
while
you
frantically
try
to
blow
it
out
