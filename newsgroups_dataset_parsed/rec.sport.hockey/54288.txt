THUMBS
UP
YOUR
IN
ARTICLE
WROTE
I
THINK
THIS
PROVES
BY
POINT
THE
CAPS
GAME
GOES
INTO
OVERTIME
BUT
DUE
TO
CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS
THEY
HAVE
TO
SWITCH
TO
THE
FUCKING
BASEBALL
SORRY
FOR
MY
LANGUAGE
BUT
IM
PISSED
WHAT
THE
HELL
WERE
THEY
GOING
TO
DO
IF
THEIR
SCHEDULED
GAME
WENT
INTO
OVERTIME
ESPN
GET
YOUR
HEAD
OUT
OF
YOUR
ASS
NOW
I
KNOW
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
HEY
AMERICAN
HOCKEY
FANS
AS
A
HOCKEY
FAN
I
CAN
SYMPATHIZE
WITH
THEFRUSTRATION
THAT
YOU
FEEL
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
OTHER
AMERICANS
DONT
GIVE
A
SHIT
ABOUT
HOCKEY
THEY
VIEW
IT
AS
A
BUNCH
OF
CANADIANS
WITH
BAD
ACCENTS
AND
MISSING
TEETH
BEATING
THE
SHIT
OUT
OF
EACH
OTHER
ON
A
PATCH
OF
ICE
WHEN
IT
IS
TOO
WARM
NOW
IN
TWOTHIRDS
OF
THE
US
TO
SEE
THE
STUFF
NATURALLY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
BASEBALL
IS
THE
GASPSWOONSIGH
NATIONAL
PASTTIME
BASEBALL
IS
SO
ROMANTICIZED
IN
THE
US
THAT
YOU
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
FORGET
THAT
OTHER
SPORT
EXIST
AFTER
APRIL
AND
BEFORE
NOVEMBER
I
FEEL
THAT
SINCE
ESPN
SHOWS
BASEBALL
GAMES
A
WEEK
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
SHOW
AN
OT
HOCKEY
GAME
INSTEAD
OF
THE
OPENING
INNINGS
OF
A
BASEBALL
GAME
HELL
THE
GAME
IS
GOING
TO
LAST
SO
WHAT
IF
YOU
MISS
THE
FIRST
HRS
AND
I
AM
AN
INDIANS
FAN
SHOW
THE
END
OF
WHAT
YOU
STARTED
THEN
SWITCH
BUT
THEN
IM
A
HOCKEY
FAN
WHAT
DO
I
KNOW
BASEBALL
IS
THE
ALL
MIGHTY
SPORT
JASON
