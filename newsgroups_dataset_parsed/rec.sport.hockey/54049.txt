the
worst
thing
is
that
this
is
exactly
what
i
did
last
year
yes
id
rather
have
sc
cover
it
just
for
the
amount
of
coverage
so
this
year
you
had
a
game
on
scny
a
game
on
sca
a
game
on
espn
and
if
the
rangers
hadnt
crashed
and
burned
you
would
have
had
a
game
on
msg
what
are
you
complaining
about
the
problem
is
that
by
no
fault
of
espn
ongoing
games
are
not
covered
til
the
final
horn
sounds
with
two
channels
scny
and
sca
latefinishing
games
up
to
pacific
time
and
overtimes
elsewhere
will
kick
in
at
the
end
of
local
coverage
if
scny
is
blocked
by
the
mets
there
is
still
some
hockey
on
sca
scny
plus
with
an
espn
the
current
situation
would
be
alleviated
