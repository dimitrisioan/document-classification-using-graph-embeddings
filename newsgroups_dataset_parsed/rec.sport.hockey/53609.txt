RE
TRULY
A
SAD
DAY
FOR
HOCKEY
A
FINE
YEAR
HISTORY
CAME
TO
A
CLOSE
TONIGHT
AS
THE
MINNESOTA
NORTH
STARS
OR
NORMS
STARS
WHICHEVER
YOU
PREFER
LOST
TO
THE
RED
WINGS
BY
A
SCORE
OF
THE
STARS
GOALS
WERE
SCORED
BY
MIKE
MCPHEE
AND
ULF
DAHLEN
WHO
NETTED
TWO
INCLUDING
THE
FINAL
ONE
IN
FRANCHISE
HISTORY
WITH
LESS
THAN
A
MINUTE
TO
PLAY
YES
ITS
A
SHAME
THAT
THE
NHL
LOST
A
FINE
TEAM
IN
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
HOCKEY
MARKETS
IN
THE
COUNTRY
BEING
A
NORTH
STARS
FAN
IT
IS
SAD
TO
SEE
ALL
OF
THE
TRADITION
OF
THE
LAST
YEARS
GET
THROWN
INTO
OBLIVION
AT
THE
HANDS
OF
A
TRULY
CRAPPY
OWNER
HOPEFULLY
THE
NHL
WILL
INSTALL
AN
EXPANSION
FRANCHISE
IN
THE
TWIN
CITIES
WITHIN
THE
NEXT
FIVE
YEARS
EVEN
IF
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
A
LOT
HAS
BEEN
LOST
IN
THE
NORTH
STARS
MOVE
KEA
