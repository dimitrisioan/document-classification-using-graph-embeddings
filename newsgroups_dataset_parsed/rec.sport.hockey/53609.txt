re
truly
a
sad
day
for
hockey
a
fine
year
history
came
to
a
close
tonight
as
the
minnesota
north
stars
or
norms
stars
whichever
you
prefer
lost
to
the
red
wings
by
a
score
of
the
stars
goals
were
scored
by
mike
mcphee
and
ulf
dahlen
who
netted
two
including
the
final
one
in
franchise
history
with
less
than
a
minute
to
play
yes
its
a
shame
that
the
nhl
lost
a
fine
team
in
one
of
the
best
hockey
markets
in
the
country
being
a
north
stars
fan
it
is
sad
to
see
all
of
the
tradition
of
the
last
years
get
thrown
into
oblivion
at
the
hands
of
a
truly
crappy
owner
hopefully
the
nhl
will
install
an
expansion
franchise
in
the
twin
cities
within
the
next
five
years
even
if
this
is
the
case
a
lot
has
been
lost
in
the
north
stars
move
kea
