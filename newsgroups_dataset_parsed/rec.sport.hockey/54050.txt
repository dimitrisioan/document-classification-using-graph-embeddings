NELSON

WRITES
I
SAID
GUND
WILL
HAVE
TO
OPEN
HIS
CHECKBOOK
I
DIDNT
SAY
GIVE
UP
ANY
DRAFT
PICKS
OR
PROMISING
TALENT
IF
WE
COULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
MURPHY
FOR
THE
GREAT
BUT
I
AGREE
THE
SHARKS
SHOULDNT
GIVE
UP
YOUNG
TALENT
OR
EARLY
ROUND
DRAFT
PICKS
I
LISTED
CHELIOS
ET
AL
ONLY
TO
INDICATE
THE
TYPE
OF
PLAYER
I
THINK
THE
SHARKS
NEED
TO
PICK
UP
THE
RULES
ON
SIGNING
FREE
AGENTS
LESS
THAN
YEARS
OLD
PUTS
A
BIG
RESTRICTION
ON
WHAT
THE
SHARKS
CAN
PICK
UP
HOWEVER
I
DO
BELIEVER
THEY
NEED
TO
PICK
UP
SOME
PLAYERS
WHO
WILL
ADD
TOUGHNESS
TO
THE
TEAM
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
YOURE
UNLIKELY
TO
GET
ANY
REAL
QUALITY
FREE
AGENTS
WHO
DO
NOT
REQUIRE
COMPENSATION
THE
SHARKS
TRIED
WITH
MAKAROV
WHO
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
TOP
OF
THE
CLASS
AMONG
NONCOMPENSATION
FREE
AGENTS
BUT
EVEN
HE
PROBABLY
WOULDNT
HAVE
HELPED
TOO
MUCH
DONT
EXPECT
TO
GET
TOP
QUALITY
JUST
SOME
TOUGHNESS
I
DONT
VIEW
MAKAROV
AS
A
PLAYER
WHO
WOULD
ADD
TOUGHNESS
SIZE
HOPEFULLY
WONT
BE
MUCH
OF
A
WORRY
NEXT
YEAR
ALEXANDER
CHERBAYEV
AND
MICHAL
SYKORA
HAVE
AGREED
TO
MULTIYEAR
CONTRACTS
AND
IT
APPEARS
THAT
MIKE
RATHJE
WILL
ALSO
SIGN
SOON
ALL
THREE
ARE
PRETTY
BIG
SIZE
ALONE
ISNT
ENOUGH
WE
ALL
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
FEAR
KOLSTAD
STRUCK
IN
THE
EYES
OF
OPPONENTS
NOT
WELL
RATHJE
AND
SYKORA
ARE
BOTH
HIGHLY
TOUTED
PROSPECTS
UNLIKE
KOLSTAD
AND
CHERBAYEV
WAS
INITIALLY
SUPPOSED
TO
PLAY
FOR
THE
RUSSIAN
WC
TEAM
ANYBODY
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
THERE
THAT
MEANS
THAT
HES
LIKELY
TO
BE
GOOD
ENOUGH
NELSON
YOURE
CONFUSING
SKILL
AND
TOUGHNESS
MCGILLHAMMOND
JOHAN
GARPENLOV
WOULD
YOU
REALLY
RATHER
HAVE
THOSE
TWO
INSTEAD
OF
JOHAN
BY
YOUR
LOGIC
THEN
YOU
ENJOY
HAVING
FALLOON
AND
OZOLINSH
ON
INJURED
RESERVE
BY
YOUR
LOGIC
THEN
YOU
THINK
THAT
IF
THE
SHARKS
HAD
KEPT
MCGILL
AND
HAMMOND
THAT
YOU
CAN
GUARANTEE
THAT
FALLOON
AND
OZOLINSH
WOULDNT
HAVE
GOTTEN
HURT
THINK
AGAIN
THERE
WAS
A
CHANCE
THAT
MCGILL
WOULD
HAVE
CAUSED
OZOLINSH
TO
GET
STUCK
AT
KC
AND
AS
YOU
KNOW
HAMMOND
IS
WORTHLESS
AND
MCGILL
IS
ALMOST
WORTHLESS
WELL
WILSON
MAYBE
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
FALLOON
AND
OZOLINSH
WERE
REALLY
INJURED
ON
CHEAPSHOTS
WHO
SAID
THEY
WERE
IF
THEY
WERENT
THEN
I
DONT
SEE
ANY
JUSTIFICATION
THAT
HAVING
MCGILL
AND
HAMMOND
AROUND
WOULD
PREVENT
THEIR
INJURIES
IF
THE
INJURIES
OF
FALLOON
AND
OZOLINSH
WERE
PURELY
ACCIDENTAL
THEN
WHAT
COULD
MCGILL
AND
HAMMOND
HAVE
DONE
TO
PREVENT
THEM
HEY
GET
OFF
THE
MCGILLHAMMOND
THING
IM
NO
FAN
OF
EITHER
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
LAST
YEAR
THE
SHARKS
HAD
TOUGHNESS
THAT
WAS
MISSING
THIS
YEAR
THIS
YEAR
WE
HAD
MORE
SKILL
IM
ALL
FOR
THAT
BUT
IF
YOUR
SKILL
PLAYERS
KEEP
GETTING
BEAT
UP
AND
INJURED
THEY
CANT
DO
YOU
MUCH
GOOD
WHETHER
ITS
A
CHEAP
SHOT
OR
NOT
YOU
CANT
LET
THE
OTHER
TEAMS
PUSH
YOU
AROUND
THE
SHARKS
SIMPLY
GOT
PUSHED
AROUND
TO
MUCH
OTHER
TEAMS
KNEW
THIS
THEY
KNEW
THEY
COULD
AGGRESSIVELY
CHECK
THE
SHARKS
AND
NOT
PAY
FOR
IT
ADDING
SOME
PLAYERS
IN
THE
OFF
SEASON
WHO
WILL
ADD
SOME
TOUGHNESS
TO
THE
TEAM
WILL
HELP
INSURE
THAT
NEXT
SEASON
OTHER
TEAMS
WILL
BE
MORE
HESISTANT
TO
VIGOROUSLY
CHECK
OUR
SKILL
PLAYERS
OR
TO
TAKE
CHEAP
SHOTS
IT
DOESNT
GUARANTEE
NO
INJURIES
NOTHING
DOES
BUT
ITS
SOMETHING
THE
SHARKS
CAN
DO
TO
REDUCE
THE
NUMBER
OF
INJURIES
