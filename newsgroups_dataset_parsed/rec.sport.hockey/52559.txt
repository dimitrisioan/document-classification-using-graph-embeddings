LOOKING
AT
THE
WAY
THE
DIVISIONS
WERE
REALIGNED
THERE
ARE
SIX
TEAMS
EACH
IN
THE
CENTRAL
NORRIS
AND
PACIFIC
SMYTH
DIVISIONS
WHILE
THERE
ARE
SEVEN
TEAMS
EACH
IN
THE
NORTHEAST
ADAMS
AND
ATLANTIC
PATRICK
DIVISIONS
THE
THOUGHT
OCCURS
TO
ME
THAT
INHERENT
IN
THE
REALIGNMENT
IS
EXPANSION
OF
ONE
TEAM
IN
THE
CENTRAL
DIVISION
AND
ONE
TEAM
IN
THE
PACIFIC
DIVISION
ALTHOUGH
IVE
SEEN
NOTHING
PUBLISHED
THAT
INDICATES
THAT
ACTUALLY
WHEN
THE
NHL
EXPANSION
COMMITTEE
WAS
FORMED
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
BACK
BEFORE
THE
OTTAWA
AND
TAMPA
BAY
EXPANSION
JOHN

STATED
AT
THE
TIME
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
NHLS
EXPANSION
PLAN
TO
GROW
TO
TEAMS
PER
DIVISION

THE

OF

LAST

DURING

SHARKS
BROADCAST
COMMISSIONER
BETTMAN
WAS
INTERVIEWED
DURING
THE
FIRST
INTERMISSION
HE
MADE
NO
BONES
ABOUT
IT
THE
EXPANSION
TO
IS
ON
PERMANENT
HOLD
UNTIL
HE
IS
SATISFIED
THAT
THE
CURRENT
ALLOTMENT
OF
ARE
FULLY
STABLE
THIS
MEANS
THAT
CITIES
LOOKING
FOR
A
CLUB
IN
THE
FORESEEABLE
FUTURE
WILL
HAVE
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
ONE
TEAM
IN
SOME
LOCATION
FAILS
OR
LOOKS
TO
RELOCATE
THIS
IS
GOOD
IMO
THERES
NO
SENSE
IN
EXPANDING
IF
IT
ONLY
MEANS
MORE
FAILING
