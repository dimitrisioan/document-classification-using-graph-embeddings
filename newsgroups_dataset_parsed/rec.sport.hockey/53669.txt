A
VERY
SIMILAR
TEAM

CDI
LOW
SCORING
DEFENSIVE
GOOD
GOALTENDING
JOHN
LEBLANC
AND
STU
BARNES
ARE
THE
ONLY
NOTICABLE
GUNS
ON
THE

BUT
THE
DEFENSE

TOP
NOTCH
AND
MIKE
ONEILL
IS
THE
MOST
UNDERRATED
GOALIE
IN
THE
LEAGUE
BRI
AS
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
TELL
YOU
SINCE
FEBRUARY
MICHAEL
ONEILL
MIGHT
BE
THE
MOST
UNDERRATED
GOALIE

GUN
FOR
THE
HAWKS
BUT

THE
THIRD
LINE

BUT
I
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
GIVEN
INCORRECT
INFO
