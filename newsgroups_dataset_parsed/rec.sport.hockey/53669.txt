moncton
is
a
very
similar
team
to
cdi
low
scoring
defensive
good
goaltending
john
leblanc
and
stu
barnes
are
the
only
noticable
guns
on
the
team
but
the
defense
is
top
notch
and
mike
oneill
is
the
most
underrated
goalie
in
the
league
bri
as
i
have
tried
to
tell
you
since
february
michael
oneill
might
be
the
most
underrated
goalie
in
the
ahl
but
he
isnt
in
the
ahl
hes
on
the
winnipeg
jets
injury
list
as
he
has
been
since
his
first
nhl
start
against
the
ottawa
senators
hes
out
until
next
year
after
surgery
to
repair
a
shoulder
separation
stu
barnes
might
be
an
ahl
gun
for
the
hawks
but
hes
now
the
third
line
center
with
the
jets
and
has
been
since
mid
january
or
so
sorry
my
memory
is
gone
i
thought
that
oneill
got
sent
back
down
in
february
but
i
must
have
been
given
incorrect
info
i
guess
this
says
it
all
about
moncton
because
barnes
is
still
one
of
their
top
or
so
scorers
even
though
hes
been
out
since
january
