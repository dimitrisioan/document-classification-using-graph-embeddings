RE
WC
RESULTS
APRIL
FROM
IN
ARTICLE
STEVEGCADKEYCOM
STEVE
GALLICHIO
WRITES
WHAT
IS
THE
POLICY
REGARDING
PLAYERS
AND
THE
MINOR
LEAGUE
PLAYOFFS
VERSUS
WC
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
RANGERS
ARE
HOLDING
BACK
KOVALEV
ZUBOV
AND
ANDERSSON
FOR
BINGHAMTON
BUT
I
ALSO
KNOW
THAT
THE
WHALERS
WANTED
MICHAEL
NYLANDER
TO
PLAY
FOR
SPRINGFIELD
WHILE
NYLANDER
WANTED
TO
PLAY
FOR
SWEDEN
THE
WHALERS
ALLOWED
THE
NHL
TO
DECIDE
AND
THE
NHL
CHOSE
THE
WCS
HOW
DOES
THIS
DIFFER
FROM
THE
RANGERS
AND
OILERS
DID
THE
WHALERS
HAVE
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
LEAGUE
OR
COULD
THEY
HAVE
FORCED
NYLANDER
TO
PLAY
IN
SPRINGFIELD
AS
LONG
AS
A
PLAYER
IS
UNDER
CONTRACT
TO
AN
ORGANIZATION
HE
IS
OBLIGATED
TO
PLAY
ONLY
WHERE
THAT
ORGANIZATION
TELLS
HIM
TO
PLAY
OR
GIVES
HIM
PERMISSION
TO
PLAY
THE
RANGERS
ARE
CERTAINLY
WITHIN
THEIR
RIGHTS
TO
FORCE
ZUBOV
AND
ANDERSSON
TO
REPORT
TO
BINGHAMPTON
IT
CERTAINLY
DOES
REFLECT
A
LACK
OF
CLASS
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
RANGER
ORGANIZATION
HOWEVER
IS
HAVING
BINGHAMPTON
WIN
THE
CALDER
CUP
REALLY
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
THEM
THAN
KEEPING
THEIR
PLAYERS
HAPPY
ALAN
