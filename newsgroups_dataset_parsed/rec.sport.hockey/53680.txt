ROGER

WRITES
CERTAINLY
PLUGGERS
ARE
AN
INTEGRAL
PART
OF
ANY
TEAM
AND
THAT
IS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
NOT
ENOUGH
SOLID
TWOWAY
PLAYERS
TO
GO
AROUND
WHO
WOULD
YOU
RATHER
HAVE
AS
YOUR
CHECKING
CENTRE
DOUG
GILMOUR
OR
DOUG
JARVIS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
I
WOULD
TAKE
EITHER
GRETZKY
OR
MARIO
AS
MY
CHECKING
CENTRES
DO
YOU
THINK
GRETZKY
COULD
COVER
BOB
GAINEY
GRETZKY
LEMIEUX
GILMOUR
ETC
DO
NOT
PLAY
THE
ROLE
OF
CHECKING
CENTREMAN
THEY
PLAY
AN
OFFENSIVE
ROLE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
A
DEFENSIVE
ONE
IF
THEY
WERE
USED
AS
DEFENSIVE
CENTRES
IT
WOULD
BE
A
WASTE
OF
THEIR
OFFENSIVE
ABILITIES
WHEN
YOU
COMPARE
GRETZKY
ET
AL
TO
JARVIS
GAINEY
ETC
YOU
ARE
COMPARING
APPLES
AND
ORANGES
IT
IS
LIKE
ME
TELLING
YOU
THAT
FELIX
POTVIN
ISNT
VERY
GOOD
BECAUSE
A
TEAM
WOULD
BE
BETTER
IF
THE
HAD
LEMIEUX
INSTEAD
OF
HIM
SURE
LEMIEUX
IS
A
BETTER
PLAYER
BUT
HE
IS
A
DIFFERENT
TYPE
OF
PLAYER
FOR
A
TEAM
TO
BE
SUCCESSFUL
THEY
NEED
TO
HAVE
ALL
TYPES
OF
PLAYERS
THIS
INCLUDES
DEFENSIVE
FORWARDS
WHEN
COMPARED
WITH
OTHER
DEFENSIVE
FORWARDS
BOB
GAINEY
IS
THE
GREATEST
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
EVER
HE
IS
THE
PLAYER
WHOS
TALENTS
BEST
SUITED
BEING
A
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
WHO
COMPLETELY
DOMINATED
THE
GAME
WHEN
HE
PLAYED
MAYBE
IF
A
MORE
TALENTED
PLAYER
SUCH
AS
GRETZKY
HAD
DECIDED
TO
WASTE
HIS
OFFENSIVE
TALENTS
AND
PLAY
DEFENSIVELY
HE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
BETTER
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
BUT
HE
WASNT
BOB
GAINEY
IS
THE
BEST
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
THAT
HAS
EVER
PLAYED
HOCKEY
