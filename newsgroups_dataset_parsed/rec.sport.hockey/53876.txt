RE
TRULY
A
SAD
DAY
FOR
HOCKEY
JOEL
ALVSTAD
WRITES
A
FINE
YEAR
HISTORY
CAME
TO
A
CLOSE
TONIGHT
AS
THE
MINNESOTA
NORTH
STARS
OR
NORMS
STARS
WHICHEVER
YOU
PREFER
LOST
TO
THE
RED
WINGS
BY
A
SCORE
OF
THE
STARS
GOALS
WERE
SCORED
BY
MIKE
MCPHEE
AND
ULF
DAHLEN
WHO
NETTED
TWO
INCLUDING
THE
FINAL
ONE
IN
FRANCHISE
HISTORY
WITH
LESS
THAN
A
MINUTE
TO
PLAY
THIS
IS
VERY
SAD
INDEED
MY
CONDOLENCES
TO
THE
MINNESOTA
FANS
WHO
ARE
LOSING
THEIR
TEAM
I
FEAR
THAT
WITHIN
THE
NEXT
DECADE
OR
SO
THE
ONLY
PROFESSIONAL
SPORTS
TEAM
LEFT
IN
PITTSBURGH
WILL
BE
THE
STEELERS
WE
SHOULD
ALWAYS
ENJOY
THINGS
WHEN
WE
CAN
YOU
NEVER
KNOW
WHEN
THEYLL
BE
TAKEN
AWAY
FROM
US
MOM
