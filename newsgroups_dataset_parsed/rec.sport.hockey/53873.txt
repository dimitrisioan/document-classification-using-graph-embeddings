KEITH
KELLER
WRITES
MY
VOTE
GOES
TO
JOHN
VANBIESBROUCK
HIS
MASK
HAS
A
SKYLINE
OF
NEW
YORK
CITY
AND
ON
THE
SIDES
THERE
ARE
A
BUNCH
OF
BEES
BEEZER
IT
LOOKS
REALLY
SHARP
FUNNY
YOU
SHOULD
MENTION
THIS
ONE
TIME
ON
HNIC
DON
CHERRY
POINTED
OUT
VANBIESBROUCKS
MASK
HE
HATED
IT
I
THINK
HE
SAID
SOMETHING
TO
THE
EFFECT
OF
YOU
SEE
HE
WAS
GREAT
LAST
YEAR
NOW
HE
GOES
OUT
AND
GETS
THAT
DOPEY
MASK
AND
HE
CANT
STOP
A
BEACHBALL
YOU
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
TAKE
CHERRY
SERIOUSLY
AT
ALL
BUT
I
CRACKED
UP
WHEN
I
HEARD
IT
I
THINK
ED
BELFOUR
HAS
THE
CURRENT
BEST
MASK
IN
THE
NHL
BTW
I
ALSO
LIKE
MOOGS
AND
ILL
GIVE
FUHRS
NEW
ONE
AN
HONOURABLE
MENTION
ALTHOUGH
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IT
CLOSELY
YET
IT
LOOKED
GOOD
FROM
A
DISTANCE
WHATS
ALSO
NEAT
IS
CHEVALDAES
IN
DETROIT
THEY
CALL
HIM
CHEVY
SO
HE
HAS
TWO
CHECKERED
FLAGS
PAINTED
AT
THE
TOP
AS
IN
AN
AUTO
RACE
