my
vote
goes
to
john
vanbiesbrouck
his
mask
has
a
skyline
of
new
york
city
and
on
the
sides
there
are
a
bunch
of
bees
beezer
it
looks
really
sharp
funny
you
should
mention
this
one
time
on
hnic
don
cherry
pointed
out
vanbiesbroucks
mask
he
hated
it
i
think
he
said
something
to
the
effect
of
you
see
he
was
great
last
year
now
he
goes
out
and
gets
that
dopey
mask
and
he
cant
stop
a
beachball
you
may
or
may
not
take
cherry
seriously
at
all
but
i
cracked
up
when
i
heard
it
i
think
ed
belfour
has
the
current
best
mask
in
the
nhl
btw
i
also
like
moogs
and
ill
give
fuhrs
new
one
an
honourable
mention
although
i
havent
seen
it
closely
yet
it
looked
good
from
a
distance
whats
also
neat
is
chevaldaes
in
detroit
they
call
him
chevy
so
he
has
two
checkered
flags
painted
at
the
top
as
in
an
auto
race
