RE
THIS

BIGGEST
AND
WORST
OPINION
IN

JOSEPHMDAKES
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
SETHCBNEWSHCBATTCOM
PETERRCLARKJR
WRITES
SO
ROUSSEL
WAS
GIVING
UP
ALMOST
ANOTHER
GOAL
A
GAME
WHILE
FACING
A
PROPORTIONAL
NUMBER
OF
SHOTS
FOR
THE
NUMBER
OF
MINUTES
HE
PLAYED
AND
WHILE
I
HAVET
ACTUALLY
CHECKED
I
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
FACED
A
LOWER
QUALITY
OF
OPPONENT
MAKE
THAT
LESS
THAN
HALF
A
GOAL
A
GAME
THE
LOWER
QUALITY
OF
OPPONET
ARGUMENT
IS
IMMATERIAL
AS
NEITHER
ROUSSEL
NOR
SODERSTROM
HAD
ANY
SAY
IN
THE
MATTER
THAT
WAS
DINEENS
DECISION
SO
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
ROUSSEL
SHUTS
OUT
THE
SHARKS
AND
SODERSTROM
SHUTS
OUT
THE
PENGUINS
THATS
IMMATERIAL
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
THE
COACHES
DECISION
COME
ON
JOE
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
YOURE
SAYING
WHO
THEY
PLAYED
IS
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
WHY
THEY
PLAYED
THEM
IS
WHATS
IRRELEVENT
A
LOW
GAA
AGAINST
GOOD
TEAMS
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
LOW
GAA
AGAINST
BAD
TEAMS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
COMPARING
TWO
GOALTENDERS
A
LOW
GAA
IS
BETTER
THEN
A
HIGHER
GAA
A
LOW
GAA
AGAINST
GOOD
TEAMS
IS
MUCH
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
A
HIGHER
GAA
AGAINST
BAD
TEAMS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
COMPARING
TWO
GOALTENDERS
THE
FACT
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
THAT
DESPITE
LAST
NIGHTS
SHUTOUT
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
WHAT
IT
TAKES
LAST
NIGHT
WAS
DUE
TO
AN
INEPT
RANGER
TEAM
MUCH
MORE
THAN
ROUSSELS
SKILL
A
ON
AND
THEY
DONT
GET
A
SHOT
AWAY
A
ON
NONE
AND
ONE
GUY
JUST
PASSES
AND
STOPS
THE
OTHER
GUY
SHOOTS
INTO
ROUSSELS
PAD
CMON
PETE
SO
THE
RANGERS
WERE
INEPT
A
SHUTOUT
IS
A
SHUTOUT
DURING
BOTH
OF
SODERSTROMS
MASTERPIECES
AGAINST
TORONTO
MIKE
EMERICH
WAS
QUOTED
AS
SAYING
HE
DIDNT
THINK
THE
LEAFS
HAD
MUCH
OFFENSIVE
FIREPOWER
PAST
THEIR
FIRST
LINE
DOES
THAT
MAKE
SODERSTROMS
SHUTOUTS
LESS
IMPRESSIVE
BECAUSE
OF
TORONTOS
LACK
OF
OFFENSE
YES
IT
DOES
ABSOLUTELY
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
COMPARING
TWO
GOALTENDERS
OF
COURSE
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
POINTS
IS
POINTS
NO
MATTER
HOW
YOU
GET
THEM
AND
ON
THE
SCORE
SHEETS
SHUTOUTS
ARE
SHUTOUTS
BUT
IF
YOURE
A
COACH
DECIDING
BETWEEN
TWO
GOALIES
OR
A
GM
LOOKING
TO
MAKE
A
TRADE
YOU
HAVE
GOT
TO
LOOK
DEEPER
THAN
THE
STAT
SHEETS
I
DIDNT
SEE
THE
SECOND
TORONTO
GAME
BUT
THE
FIRST
ONE
WAS
A
DEFENSIVE
MASTERPIECE
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
IN
THAT
GAME
TO
JUDGE
TOMMY
SODERSTROM
ON
BECAUSE
HE
WASNT
TESTED
THE
SAME
FOR
ROUSSEL
IN
THE
RANGER
GAME
TWO
REAL
SCORING
CHANCES
ONE
HE
MADE
A
GREAT
PLAY
THE
OTHER
HE
WAS
SAVED
BY
A
MISTAKE
FROM
THE
OTHER
PLAYER
IF
YOU
WERE
JUDGING
ROUSSEL
ON
THAT
GAME
ALONE
YOU
HAVE
VERY
LITTLE
TO
GO
BY
BUT
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
TIE
AGAINST
THE
HABS
YOU
SAW
A
GOALIE
STAND
ON
HIS
HEAD
TO
GET
THAT
SHUTOUT
THAT
WAS
A
GOALIE
IN
ACTION
ROUSSEL
DOESNT
HAVE
A
GAME
LIKE
THAT
IN
HIM
WELL
IF
YOU
LOOK
BACK
TO
NOVEMBER
WHEN
ROUSSEL
WAS
THE
GOALIE
SODERSTROM
WAS
BEING
TREATED
FOR
HIS
HEART
AILMENT
THE
FLYERS
FINISHED
NOVEMBER
AT
AND
WERE
OVERALL
AND
THERES
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
WHERE
THE
FLYERS
WOULD
HAVE
FINISHED
IF
SODERSTOM
WASNT
WEARING
THE
ORAGNE
N
BLACK
IM
GLAD
WE
DONT
HAVE
TO
FIND
OUT
ANYTIME
SOON
EITHER
BECAUSE
HE
IS
ONE
HELL
OF
A
PLAYER
I
WOULD
TAKE
HIM
OVER
ROUSSEL
RIGHT
NOW
BUT
I
STILL
THINK
DOM
HAS
WHAT
IT
TAKES
TO
BE
THE
GUY
HE
OUTPERFORMED
HEXTALL
ENOUGH
DURING
THE
SEASON
TO
MAKE
FLYERS
MANAGEMENT
THINK
THAT
WAY
TOO
DONT
BE
SO
SURE
OF
THAT
FLYERS
MANAGEMENT
NEVER
SAYS
BAD
THING
ABOUT
ROUSSEL
BUT
THEY
DONT
SAY
TOO
MUCH
ON
THE
GOOD
SIDE
EITHER
IVE
SEEN
AT
LEAST
TWO
INTERVIEWS
WHERE
EVERY
TIME
FARWELL
WAS
ASKED
HOW
HAPPY
HE
WAS
TO
HAVE
TWO
GOOD
GOALTENDERS
IT
WAS
TOMMY
THIS
TOMMY
THAT
AND
OH
YEAH
DOM
HAS
PLAYED
WELL
TOO
BY
THE
WAY
WHAT
WAS
THE
FINAL
CARD
ON
MONDAY
NIGHT
TEAM
PICTURE
BY
ANY
CHANCE
FLYERS
IN
THE
NHL
HALL
OF
FAME
KINDA
DULL
REALLY
THEY
HANDED
OUT
A
TEAM
PICTURE
TO
EVERYBODY
WHO
WALKED
IN
FROM
PIZZA
HUT
BUT
IT
WAS
THE
SAME
PICTURE
THEY
SOLD
IN
THE
PROGRAMS
IN
MIDSEASON
HAD
NAMES
LIKE
BENNING
KASPER
AND
HOW
DID
THE
FLYERS
CHOOSE
THE
FANS
WHO
RECEIVED
THE
SHIRTS
OFF
OUR
BACKS
WINNING
RECCHIS
JERSEY
AFTER
BREAKING
THE
CLUBS
SINGLE
SEASON
POINT
RECORD
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NICE
BUT
KNOWING
YOUR
LUCK
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
WON
ROUSSELS
MOSTLY
RANDOM
SEAT
LOCATIONS
SOME
WERE
GIVEN
OUT
BY
HAVING
CERTAIN
AUTOGRAPHS
ON
THE
TEAM
PHOTOS
I
DONT
LIKE
THAT
METHOD
SINCE
IVE
SEEN
GUARDS
HELP
OUT
PEOPLE
GET
THINGS
LIKE
LINDROS
PICTURES
SURELY
IF
THEY
GOT
THEIR
HANDS
ON
AN
AUTOGRAPHED
PICTURE
THEYD
HOLD
EM
FOR
THEIR
BUDDIES
