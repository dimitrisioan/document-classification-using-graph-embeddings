ESPN
IS
PATHETIC
I
HAVE
BEEN
WATCHING
EVERYBODY
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
ESPNS
COVERAGE
AND
I
AGREE
WITH
ALL
OF
YOU
MIGHT
I
SUGGEST
THAT
WE
ARE
GETTING
ALL
WORKED
UP
OVER
NOTHING
WE
ALL
KNEW
THAT
ESPNS
COVERAGE
WAS
GOING
TO
SUCK
I
MEAN
HAVE
YOU
EVER
WATCHED
DURING
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
SPORTSCENTER
COVERAGE
OF
HOCKEY
IT
SUCKS
I
MEAN
REALLY
SUCKS
ESPN
DOES
NOT
KNOW
HOCKEY
IF
IT
SHOT
THEM
IN
THE
ASS
I
WAS
REALLY
PISSED
OF
ABOUT
LAST
NIGHT
COVERAGE
I
GO
TO
SCHOOL
IN
OHIO
I
KNOW
THE
INDIANS
SUCK
SO
WHY
SHOW
THEM
IF
I
WERE
BILL
CLEMENT
I
WOULD
SHOOT
MYSELF
I
HOPE
THIS
MAKES
YOU
FEEL
BETTER
BUT
THE
OVERTIME
BETWEEN
THE
ISLES
AND
THE
CAPS
WAS
GREAT
HANG
IN
THERE
