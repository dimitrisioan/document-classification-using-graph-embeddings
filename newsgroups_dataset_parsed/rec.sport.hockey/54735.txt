i
wouldnt
say
that
the
letter
clearly
implies
representation
of
the
views
of
a
group
that
you
belong
to
it
represents
a
subset
that
you
dont
belong
to
of
a
larger
group
which
you
do
if
only
because
this
isnt
a
moderated
group
and
you
can
bet
that
i
wouldnt
be
the
only
one
not
belonging
to
the
moderated
group
if
it
was
moderated
by
an
anallyretentive
little
dullard
like
yourself
look
there
are
several
ways
to
state
an
opposing
viewpoint
three
that
come
to
mind
are
as
follows
i
hardly
need
you
to
presume
to
lecture
me
on
how
to
communicate
my
points
of
view
this
posting
that
you
have
made
is
the
second
on
the
subject
of
the
nhl
letter
and
you
have
yet
to
communicate
your
opinion
on
the
matter
instead
you
content
yourself
with
flaming
me
say
it
directly
and
obnoxiously
result
result
moronic
little
busy
bodies
like
yourself
take
advantage
of
a
perceived
opportunity
to
post
rules
for
others
to
live
by
you
realize
that
anything
you
say
can
and
most
certainly
will
be
used
against
you
well
if
using
it
against
me
means
you
are
going
to
post
something
of
significance
then
by
all
means
go
ahead
i
insist
otherwise
why
dont
you
just
go
back
to
sleep
or
do
whatever
it
is
that
you
do
when
you
are
all
by
yourself
cordially
as
always
