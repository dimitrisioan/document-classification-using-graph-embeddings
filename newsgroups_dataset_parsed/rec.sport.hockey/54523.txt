DVBICK
DAVID
VAN
BEVEREN
WRITES
WHEN
YOU
THINK
OF
THE
NHL
WHO
COMES
TO
MIND
GILMOUR
GRETZKY
MARIO
AH
DID
I
MENTION
MARIO
IF
YOU
SAID
GRETZKY
YOU
HAVENT
REALLY
BEEN
FOLLOWING
ALONG
HAVE
YOU
IF
YOU
SAID
GILMOUR
YOU
ARE
A
TRUE
MAYNARD
I
DONT
EVEN
THINK
THE
SELECTION
OF
THE
HART
DESERVES
SERIOUS
DISCUSSION
ON
THIS
GROUP
IT
IS
A
NOBRAINER
WHILE
I
AGREE
THAT
LEMIEUX
DESERVES
THE
HART
IT
IS
FAR
FROM
A
NOBRAINER
THE
HART
TROPHY
GOES
TO
THE
PLAYER
MOST
VALUABLE
TO
HIS
TEAM
NOT
TO
THE
BEST
PLAYER
IN
THE
LEAGUE
SO
YOUR
ABOVE
ARGUEMENT
IS
REALLY
WORTHLESS
THE
PENS
WITHOUT
MARIO
ARE
STILL
A
DAMN
GOOD
HOCKEY
TEAM
THE
LEAFS
WITHOUT
GILMOUR
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
FIGHTING
TAMPA
BAY
FOR
THE
PICK
LIKE
I
SAID
MARIO
DESERVES
IT
IMHO
BUT
IT
IS
A
VERY
CLOSE
RACE
AND
A
GILMOUR
VICTORY
WOULD
NOT
SURPRISE
ME
I
DISLIKE
DOUG
GILMOUR
WITH
A
PASSION
BUT
I
MUST
CONCEDE
THAT
HE
IS
EXTREMELY
VALUABLE
TO
THE
LEAFS
