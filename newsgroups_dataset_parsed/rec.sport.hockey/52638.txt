RE
SAD
DAY
FOR
HOCKEY
DVBICK
WRITES
FOUL
ANY
ILLEGAL
CONTACT
WITH
THE
OTHER
PLAYER
OR
HIS
STICK
WITH
YOUR
BODY
OR
STICK
IF
YOU
GET
YOU
ARE
OUT
FOR
THE
GAME
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
GAME
WHERE
ONE
PLAYER
HAS
COMMITTED
PENALTIES
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
WOULD
REQUIRE
MORE
ATTENTION
BY
THE
REFEREE
UNSPORTSMANLIKE
CONTACT
AN
INTENTIONAL
FOUL
THIS
INLCLUDES
ALL
THE
CURRENT
FLAVOURS
OF
ROUGHING
FIGHTING
AND
BOARDING
IF
YOU
GET
TWO
YOU
ARE
THROWN
OUT
OF
THE
GAME
AND
FINED
TECHNICAL
FOUL
BAD
MOUTHING
THE
REF
BY
PLAYER
OR
COACH
PENALTY
SHOT
IS
AWARDED
TWO
AND
YOU
ARE
THROWN
OUT
OF
THE
GAME
BESIDES
THE
PENALTY
SHOT
FOR
ONE
TECHNICAL
IF
THE
TEAM
GETS
PENALTIES
IN
A
PERIOD
THE
OPPOSING
TEAM
GETS
A
PENALTY
SHOT
FOR
EVERY
ADDITIONAL
ONE
UNTIL
THE
END
OF
THE
PERIOD
THE
VICTIM
GETS
TWO
SHOTS
IF
HESHE
WAS
IN
THE
ACT
OF
SHOOTING
WHEN
THE
FOUL
OCURED
THIS
WORKS
WELL
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
FIRST
PENALTY
SHOTS
ARE
THE
MOST
EXCITING
THING
IN
HOCKEY
RIGHT
SO
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
THE
MORE
THE
BETTER
NEXT
WHEN
THE
PLAYER
IS
SETTING
UP
FOR
A
PENALTY
SHOT
THE
NETWORK
CAN
TAKE
A
COMMERCIAL
FINALLY
WITH
ONLY
THREE
PENALTIES
THE
NETWORK
ANNOUNCERS
DON
MEREDITH
DICK
VITALE
JOHN
MADDEN
PAT
SUMMERALL
AND
MARV
LEVY
AMONG
OTHERS
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
THE
VIEWERS
WHAT
HAPPENED
BEFORE
THE
PA
ANNOUNCER
SAYS
IT
BUT
YOURE
CREATING
A
SCORING
OPPORTUNITY
WHERE
THERE
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
ONE
BEFORE
I
CAN
SEE
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
FREE
THROWS
AWARDED
AFTER
A
CERTAIN
NUMBER
OF
FOULS
BUT
ITS
OBVIOUSLY
EASIER
TO
SCORE
IN
BASKETBALL
THERE
ARE
MORE
OPPORTUNITIES
IF
A
BASKETBALL
TEAM
SCORES
POINTS
THATS
AT
LEAST
FIFTY
CHANCES
MADE
THE
AVERAGE
NUMBER
OF
SHOTS
TAKEN
BY
EACH
TEAM
IN
A
HOCKEY
GAME
AND
THIS
IS
A
TOTAL
GUESS
IS
PROBABLY
AROUND
AND
A
TEAM
IS
LUCKY
TO
CAPITALIZE
ON
MAYBE
OF
THEM
YOU
HAVE
SOME
GOOD
IDEAS
CONCERNING
THE
OTHER
PENALTIES
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
A
PLAYER
SHOULD
BE
AWARDED
A
PENALTY
SHOT
ONLY
WHEN
THEY
HAD
A
CHANCE
TO
SCORE
AND
WAS
INTERFERED
WITH
ALSO
LATER
IN
THE
POST
YOU
TALKED
ABOUT
HOW
BORING
THE
NBA
GAME
YOU
ATTENDED
WAS
THAT
PLAY
WAS
STOPPED
TOO
OFTEN
WOULDNT
YOUR
PENALTY
SHOT
RULE
TAKE
UP
MORE
TIME
DURING
A
HOCKEY
GAME
