INCLUDING
ME
KNOWS
WHERE
DEPALMA
WAS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
THE
SHARKS
APPEARED
TO
STILL
HAVE
HIS
RIGHTS
BUT
HE
WASNT
IN
SAN
JOSE
HE
WASNT
IN
KANSAS
CITY
AND
HIS
NAME
HASNT
APPEARED
ON
THE
WAIVER
WIRE
SORRY
NELSON
BUT
YOU
FORGOT
TO
ASK
ME
IF
YOU
CHECK
THE
THN
STATS
FOR
KANSAS
CITY
YOULL
FIND
THAT
LARRY
HAS
BEEN
PLAYING
FOR
THE
GAMES
HAVING
PLAYED
IN
GAMES
IN
THE
PERIOD
COVERED
IN
THE
STATS
BETWEEN
AND
THE
ISSUE
WITH
PIM
NOT
EXACTLY
INVISIBLE
HE
THEN
WAS
SENT
DOWN
TO
KANSAS
CITY
WALKED
OUT
FROM
THERE
AND
WAS
SUSPENDED
AND
LATER
REINSTATED
WHEN
IT
WAS
REVEALED
THAT
HE
WAS
INJURED
HE
THEN
PROMPTLY
DISAPPEARED
FROM
THE
WATCHING
EYES
OF
SHARK
BYTES
AS
THE
MAILING
LIST
IS
NOW
KNOWN
TO
SHARKS
OFFICIALS
FAITHFUL
AND
NEITHER
THE
SHARKS
NOR
WE
MISS
HIM
WELL
HAVING
GOTTEN
TO
A
CHANCE
TO
TALK
TO
HIM
A
FEW
TIMES
THIS
ISNT
QUITE
ACCURATE
HE
INJURED
HIS
BACK
A
DISK
INJURY
AND
DID
ONE
STUPID
THING
WHICH
WAS
TO
HIDE
IT
FROM
THE
SHARKS
AND
HE
TRIED
TO
PLAY
THROUGH
IT
BECAUSE
HE
KNEW
HE
WAS
ON
THE
BUBBLE
THE
SHARKS
THEN
SENT
HIM
TO
KC
AT
WHICH
POINT
HE
DISCLOSED
THE
INJURY
SINCE
HE
DIDNT
DISCLOSE
IT
THE
SHARKS
AND
HE
DISAGREED
ABOUT
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
HE
WAS
SUSPENDED
FOR
NOT
REPORTING
THAT
WAS
EVENTUALLY
WORKED
OUT
THE
SHARKS
REINSTATED
HIM
AS
INJURED
AND
PUT
HIM
INTO
THERAPY
AND
WHEN
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
PLAY
THEN
SHIPPED
HIM
DOWN
TO
KC
HE
FULLY
EXPECTS
TO
PLAY
IN
THE
NHL
AGAIN
ALTHOUGH
CLEARLY
NOT
WITH
THE
SHARKS
HIDING
INJURIES
IS
A
STUPID
NONO
BEYOND
JUST
A
NONO
VERY
NICE
GUY
ALWAYS
HUSTLED
HIS
BUTT
OFF
HE
DISAPPEARED
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
HURT
I
EXPECT
HELL
SURFACE
WITH
ANOTHER
TEAM
AT
SOME
POINT
PROBABLY
ANOTHER
EXPANSION
TEAM
BUT
IS
LIKELY
TO
BE
A
BUBBLE
PLAYER
FOR
THE
REST
OF
HIS
CAREER
HAS
A
GOOD
WORK
ETHIC
AND
IS
GOOD
AT
GETTING
OTHER
PLAYERS
MOTIVATED
UNFORTUNATELY
HE
PLAYED
HIMSELF
OUT
OF
THE
SHARKS
FUTURE
WITH
A
BAD
JUDGEMENT
CALL
JOHN
CARTER
SEASON
ACQUIRED
FREE
AGENT
FROM
BOSTON
GRADE
I
BB
HE
IS
VERY
UNLIKELY
TO
BE
BACK
NEXT
SEASON
ALWAYS
GAVE
BEST
WORK
ETHIC
ON
THE
CLUB
EXCEPT
MAYBE
KISIO
BUT
HUSTLE
ISNT
ALWAYS
ENOUGH
HIS
FUTURE
WITH
THE
SHARKS
WAS
MADE
CLEAR
TO
ME
ONE
NIGHT
AGAINST
THE
FLAMES
WHEN
HE
WENT
BEHIND
THE
CREASE
AND
TRIED
TO
HOLD
JOEL
OTTO
AGAINST
THE
BOARD
HE
LITERALLY
HAD
ONE
ARM
AROUND
OTTOS
NECK
AND
ANOTHER
WRAPPED
AROUND
OTTOS
STICK
ARM
OTTO
CASUALLY
TURNED
AROUND
AND
FED
THE
PUCK
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
CREASE
FOR
A
GOAL
AS
THOUGH
CARTER
WASNT
THERE
HUSTLE
CAN
ONLY
COVER
SIZE
SO
FAR
THE
SHARKS
HAVE
TOLD
ME
POINT
BLANK
THAT
HES
GONE
FOR
GOOD
DITTO
HUBIE
MCDONOUGH
HE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
FAVORITES
OF
THE
STAFF
BUT
AS
ONE
SAID
TO
ME
YOU
HAVE
TO
MAKE
ROOM
FOR
THE
KIDS
CARTER
IN
FACT
REFUSED
TO
REPORT
TO
KC
AND
HAS
BEEN
SUSPENDED
BY
THE
SHARKS
THAT
MIGHT
BE
A
DEFACTO
RETIREMENT
BUT
I
HAVENT
HEARD
ANYTHING
OFFICIAL
HIS
ONLY
HOPE
IN
HOCKEY
NOW
IS
THE
GULLS
JEANFRANCOIS
QUINTIN
SEASON
ACQUIRED
FROM
MINNESOTA
IN
DISPERSAL
DRAFT
GRADE
I
BB
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THE
SHARKS
DIDNT
LET
QUINTIN
PLAY
ANY
MORE
THAN
THE
GAMES
HE
PLAYED
THIS
SEASON
BECAUSE
AT
LEAST
FROM
THE
GAMES
I
SAW
HIM
IN
HE
WAS
OUTMATCHED
AND
LOOKED
FAIRLY
LOST
ON
THE
ICE
I
THINK
HE
SHOWS
POTENTIAL
BUT
I
DIDNT
THINK
HE
WAS
QUITE
READY
TO
MAKE
THE
JUMP
TO
THE
NHL
HE
SHOULD
BE
A
SOLID
CONTENDER
FOR
REGULAR
DUTY
NEXT
SEASON
AGREED
BTW
I
STILL
THINK
A
LOT
OF
YOUR
GRADES
ARE
MORE
BASED
ON
HOW
YOU
WISH
THEYD
PERFORMED
THAN
HOW
THEY
ACTUALLY
PERFORMED
I
WONDER
WHETHER
YOU
CAN
REALLY
JUDGE
TALENT
FROM
RADIO
AND
TELEVISION
NELSON
I
KNOW
I
HAVE
TROUBLE
SINCE
YOU
DONT
SEE
THE
OFFPUCK
ACTION
YOUR
VIEWS
FROM
HOME
AND
MY
VIEWS
FROM

NUMEROUS
