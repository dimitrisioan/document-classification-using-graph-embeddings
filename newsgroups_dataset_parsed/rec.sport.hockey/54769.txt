shame
shim
a
hockey
fan
from
way
back
and
maintain
an
interest
as
best
i
can
here
in
the
hockey
hinterlands
oklahoma
im
hoping
i
can
get
a
reading
from
some
of
you
about
the
move
of
the
north
stars
to
dallas
shive
been
under
the
impression
that
minnesota
was
one
of
or
possibly
the
hockey
state
in
the
us
so
why
is
the
team
moving
to
a
city
in
texas
is
it
that
the
owner
is
a
greedy
selfserving
profiteer
or
were
the
stars
really
not
making
a
profit
or
was
the
city
or
whoever
owned
the
arena
doing
some
price
gouging
shas
much
as
id
like
to
see
the
nhl
only
a
hour
drive
from
me
i
cant
help
but
feel
for
the
people
in
minnesota
unless
they
truly
didnt
support
the
team
shopinions
please
i
used
to
work
for
the
stars
minnesota
supported
the
team
to
an
extent
when
i
was
there
we
had
quite
afew
sellouts
this
was
the
season
after
the
cup
run
and
during
the
finals
norms
main
bitch
was
that
there
wasnt
enough
luxury
suites
and
the
ones
he
had
were
not
always
full
he
wanted
more
boxes
and
wanted
them
full
he
was
just
asking
for
too
much
from
people
that
could
go
and
see
other
hockey
games
at
high
schools
for
or
college
for
about
that
would
probably
be
better
