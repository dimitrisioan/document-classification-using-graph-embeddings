LEAFS
VERSUS
WINGS
HOW
LONG
CAN
THE
LEAFS
PLAY
SHORTHANDED
AND
STILL
BE
EXPECTED
TO
SCORE
THEY
DID
SOME
FINE
PENELYKILLING
IN
THE
FIRST
MEN
DOWN
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
MINUTES
AT
ONE
POINT
BUT
THEY
JUST
COULDNT
KEEP
IT
UP
THEY
SPENT
VIRTUALLY
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
EITHER
SHORTHANDED
OR
JUST
COMING
OFF
A
PENELTY
AS
SOON
AS

THAT
BONEHEAD
MAJOR
HIGHSTICKING
PENALTY
CULLEN
HAS
GOTTEN
STRONGER
SINCE
HIS
RETURN
FROM
INJURY
A
HANDFULL
OF
GAMES
AGO
AND
HE
PLAYED
A
GOOD
GAME
IF
THE
OTHER
PLAYERS
ON
HIS
LINE
CAN
SMARTEN
UP
THAT
LINE
SHOULD
DO
OKAY
CLARKS
GOT
TO
GET
TOUGH
HES
GOT
TO
INTIMIDATE
AND
GO
FOR
THE
NET
SEND
CLARK
UP
THE
LEFT
WING
OVER
THE
BLUE

A
COUPLE
TIMES
HIS
