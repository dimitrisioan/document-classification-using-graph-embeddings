CHHABRA
WRITES
IMPLICITLY
YOU
ARE
ASSUMING
THAT
GOALS
SCORED
AGAINST
WINNIPEG
WITH
SELANNE
ON
THE
ICE
CAN
BE
BLAMED
ON
HIMROGER
HE
IS
A
FORWARD
WINNIPEG
HAS
A
LOUSY
DEFENSIVE
RECORD
ANYWAY
LETS
PUT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
JOHN
CULLENS
IS
TERRIBLE
WHATS
YOUR
EXCUSE
FOR
HIM
THAT
HIS
POWERPLAY
POINTS
DONT
COUNT
NEITHER
DO
SELANNES
ARE
YOU
COMPARING
CULLEN
TO
SALAMI
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THAT
IS
VALID
IF
WINNIPEG
IS
SUCH
A
LOUSY
DEFENSIVE
TEAM
THEN
WHY
THE
HELL
DOES
SALAMI
STAND
AROUND
THE
OTHER
TEAMS
BLUELINE
WHEN
THE
PUCK
IS
IN
HIS
OWN
END
I
THOUGHT
THAT
HE
WAS
COMPARING
CULLEN
TO
TEEMU
SELNNE
I
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
SALAMI
IS
SOME
SORT
OF
SAUSAGE
BUT
IF
YOU
DEAR
ROGER
ARE
ABLE
TO
SEE
SALAMI
ON
THE
ICE
PLAYING
HOCKEY
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
BUT
YOU
SURELY
SHOULD
DO
SOMETHING
AND
VERY
QUICKLY
MAYBE
YOU
THINK
THAT
IF
YOU
KEEP
ON
TALKING
SOME
RUBBISH
AFTER
SOME
TIME
EVERYBODY
WILL
CONSIDER
IT
TO
BE
REALLY
TRUE
YOU
SHOULD
TAKE
CARE
OF
YOUR
LEAFS
THEY
SURELY
NEED
IT
MORE
WHAT
HE
DOES
BEST
IS
SCORESO
I
REFER
YOU
TO
MY
COMMENT
ABOVE
SOME
OF
OUR
FINNISH
FRIENDS
WHO
HAVE
WATCHED
HIM
PLAY
CLAIM
THAT
HE
CAN
PLAY
A
SOLID
TWOWAY
GAME
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
STYLE
OF
CONTRIBUTION
WOULD
BE
MORE
CONDUCIVE
TO
WINNING
OR
DONT
YOU
THINK
SO
AT
LEAST
WE
HAVE
SEEN
HIM
PLAYING
AS
IT
IS
NOW
SELANNE
IS
A
GRANDSTANDING
GOAL
SUCK
DID
YOU
SEE
THE
WAY
HE
PARADES
AROUND
WITH
HIS
ARMS
OUTSTRETCHED
AFTER
SCORING
A
GOAL
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THE
MESSIAH
HAD
RETURNED
DURING
THE
LATEST
PHILLY
GAME
THE
LEAF
PLAYERS
DIDNT
PARADE
PHILLY
CRUNCHED
THEM
MAYBE
YOU
NEED
SOME
MORE
TWO

PLAYERS
WHO
CAN
SCORE
