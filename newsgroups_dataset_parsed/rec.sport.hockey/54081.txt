abc
ratings
were
very
good
i
was
schocked
to
hear
that
abcs
telecast
was
the
fifth
most
watched
sporting
event
over
the
weekend
national
rating
came
out
to
a
very
respectable
nielsen
markets
were
at

bostonthe
game
scored
lower
at
but
it
had
some
competion
from
local
sports
teams
quite
frankly
i
expected
abcs
ratings
to
be
under
but
im
happy
to
be
proven
wrong

it
pays
off
clicking
away
on
your
cabletv
remote

if
you
happen
to

just
stumble
upon

because
the
only
night
game
in
mlb
was
being
rained
out
in

you
have
to
give
espn
credit
for
switching
to
detroits
coverage

having

people
were
giddy
over

overnight
abc
ratings
for

and
thought
it
was
a

to
