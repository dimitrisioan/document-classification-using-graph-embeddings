well
if
things
were
different
and
i
had
my
way
the
headline
would
be
nhl
european
division
regular
season
game
stockholm
storm
vs
helsinki
tornado
two
games
against
every
north
americanbased
team
in
all
and
this
might
have
been
the
ninth
and
final
regular
season
encounter
between
helsinki
and
stockholm
the
remaining
games
would
involve
paris
dortmund
milan
a
nice
dream
