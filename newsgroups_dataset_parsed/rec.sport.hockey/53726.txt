i
saw
yesterday
on
tv
a
game
between
team
sweden
and
team
finland
most
of
us
might
know
that
it
was
played
in
stockholm
and
the
result
was
for
the
home
team
thats
nothing
very
special
but
i
was
very
surprised
of
saku
koivu
i
must
admit
that
he
surprised
me
already
in
the
finnish
playoffs
and
now
on
team
finland
saku
koivu
is
a
light
weight
player
if
we
consider
his
size
according
to
my
stats
he
is
only
and
and
he
is
only
but
he
is
a
real
twoway
player
skates
well
can
score
gives
nice
passes
does
even
bodycheckings
he
is
really
something
to
watch
in
the
wc
the
size
isnt
always
everything
maybe
we
remember
harlamov
and
they
say
that
saku
is
still
growing
up
during
last
year
saku
isnt
that
small
any
longer
i
guess
i
heard
he
is
tall
at
the
moment
and
will
still
grow
