that
gary
roberts
would
be
returning
to
play
in
calgarys
last
regular
season
game
can
anybody
confirm
this
hell
be
a
big
help
to
the
flames
in
the
playoffs
and
may
change
my
playoff
pool
strategy
roberts
played
in
last
night
game
against
the
sharks
and
got
a
goal
and
an
assist
this
definitely
bolsters
calgarys
chances
in
the
playoffs
