it
is
the
most
misleading
hockey
stat
available
not
necessarily
the
most
misleading
but
you
are
right
it
definitely
needs
to
be
taken
in
the
proper
perspective
a
shining
example
is
if
you
look
at
the
penguins
individual
you
will
find
very
few
minuses
that
only
makes
common
sense
since
they
didnt
lose
many
games
until
the
nhl
publishes
a
more
useful
quantifiable
statistic
including
ice
time
per
game
and
some
measure
of
its
quality
ie
is
the
player
put
out
in
key
situations
like
protecting
a
lead
late
in
the
game
is
he
matched
up
against
the
other
teams
top
one
or
two
lines
shorthanded
etc
i
would
much
rather
see
the
disappear
altogether
instead
of
having
its
dubious
merits
trumpeted
by
those
with
little
understanding
of
its
implications
unfortunately
you
will
need
to
keep
a
ridiculous
number
of
stats
to
really
come
up
with
a
statistic
which
really
shows
a
players
value
lets
just
enjoy
the
game
and
not
overanalyze
it
like
im
doing
now
excuse
me
