THE

REASONS

SINGS
THE
PRAISES
OF
DOUG
GILMOURA
LITTLE
GUY
WITH
HEARTYET
ONE
DOESNT
SEE
A
STRING
OF
AMERICAN
POSTS
SAYING
THAT
JOHN
MADDEN
HAS
LOST
HIS
MARBLES
MAYBE
BECAUSE
JOHN
MADDEN
DOESNT
PRETEND
THAT
HIS
ALLMADDEN
TEAM
IS
THE
TEAM
OF
THE
BEST
PLAYERS
MAYBE
BECAUSE
JOHN
MADDEN
DOESNT
FEEL
THE
NEED
TO
DENIGRATE
PLAYERS
HE
DOESNT
CHOOSE
FOR
HIS
ALLMADDEN
TEAM
MAYBE
BECAUSE
MADDEN
ACTUALLY
DEMONSTRATES
SOME
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
FOOTBALL
WHEN
HE
BROADCASTS
A
GAME
DON
CHERRY
DOESNT
DENIGRATE
PLAYERS
