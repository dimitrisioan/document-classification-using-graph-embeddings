OFFICE
HERE
IS
SOMETHING
CROSSPOSTED
FROM
THE
AHL
MAILING
LIST
IN
A
DISCUSSION
BETWEEN
ME
AND
CHRIS
LERCH
THE
SUBJECT
OF
SPRINGFIELDS
ROUND
UPSET
OF
THE
PROVIDENCE
BRUINS
CAME
UP
CHRIS
BASICALLY
RAISED
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THE
AHL
HIERARCHY
IS
BIASED
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
INDIANS
HE
NOTED
THAT
THE
OFFICES
FOR
THE
LEAGUE
ARE
IN
SPRING
AND
MANY
EXINDIANS
ARE
WORKING
FOR
THE
AHL
FURTHERMORE
HE
ALSO
INFORMED
ME
THAT
BACK
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
IN
THE
CUP
FINALS
BETWEEN
ROCH
AND
SPRING
THAT
THE
AMERKS
CHARGED
FAVORITISM
BY
THE
OFFICE
AND
THAT
THERE
WERE
LITTLE
QUESTIONABLE
THINGS
LIKET
HE
AHL
PRESIDENT
AND
STAFF
ATTENDING
ALL
GAMES
WITH
THE
SPRINGFIELD
BRASS
INCLUDING
SITTING
IN
THEIR
BOX
FOR
THE
GAME
IN
SPRINGFIELD
AND
ACCORDING
TO
THE
ROCHESTER
MEDIA
OPENLY
CHEERING
FOR
SPRINGFIELD
CERTAINLY
THIS
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
IS
QUITE
SERIOUS
IF
ANY
OF
THIS
IS
TRUE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
WHINING
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
AMERKS
THEY
HAVE
PULLED
THIS
SORT
OF
CRAP
AGAINST
THE
WINGS
BEFORE
BUT
IF
TRUE
THIS
IS
SOMTHING
THAT
SERIOUSLY
RAISES
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
PRESIDENT
JACK
