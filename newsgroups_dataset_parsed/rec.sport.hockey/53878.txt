when
is
the
draft
this
year
and
will
there
be
any
coverage
i
know
the
upcomming
nfl
draft
is
on
espn
anyone
got
the
details
paul
kariya
pick
no
perhaps
he
wont
last
long
i
dont
know
the
exact
coverage
in
the
states
in
canada
it
is
covered
by
tsn
so
maybe
espn
will
grab
their
coverage
i
dont
know
as
for
the
picks
ottawa
picks
which
means
it
is
almost
that
alexander
daigle
will
go
hell
either
stay
or
be
traded
in
montreal
or
quebec
imo
i
would
take
kariya
he
should
alot
of
leadership
in
the
ncaa
and
so
far
in
the
world
championships
daigle
didnt
show
this
for
his
junior
team
san
jose
will
then
get
kariya
tampa
bay
will
either
go
for
a
russian
kozlov
i
think
thats
it
or
a
defenseman
rob
niedemeyer
probably
spelt
the
last
name
wrong
because
of
expansion
i
wont
go
further
but
i
will
name
other
of
the
blue
chip
prospects
chris
gratton
chris
pridham
a
swedish
player
who
i
cant
remember
his
name
draft
order
ottawa
san
jose
tampa
bay
south
florida
or
anahiem
south
florida
or
anahiem
hartford
edmonton
dallas
ny
rangers
philadelphia
the
thru
picks
could
be
wrong
i
dont
have
the
standings
here
and
am
guessing
in
my
mind
there
are
top
notch
prospects
in
the
draft
with
kariya
leading
the
way
but
not
going
shawn
go
caps
two
first
round
picks
for
the
next
three
years
thanks
stlouis
or
should
i
say
ron
caron
and
scott
stevens
