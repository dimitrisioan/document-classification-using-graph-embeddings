RE

DEEPAK
CHHABRA
WRITES
HOWEVER
THAT
ASIDE
THE
REAL
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
YOU
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
CHANGING
THE
NAMES
BASED
ON
THE
REASONS
GIVEN
FOR
IT
MAKING
IT
EASIER
FOR
THE
CASUAL
FAN
OR
WHETHER
YOU
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
UNIQUE
DIVISIONAL
NAMES
BASED
ON
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
DO
DESERVE
THE
HONOUR
IMO
THE
LATTER
IS
A
NICE
AND
UNIQUE
TOUCH
THAT
DIFFERS
FROM
OTHER
SPORTS
IN
ADDITION
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
CHANGING
DIVISIONAL
NAMES
WILL
HAVE
AN
EFFECT
ON
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
HOCKEY
SO
ITS
A
POINTLESS
EXERCISE
ANYWAY
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
WAY
THE
GAME
IS
BEING
PRESENTED
TO
THE
FANS
I
FEEL
THAT
GEOGRAPHICAL
NAMES
WOULD
ENHANCE
REGIONAL
LOYALTIES
MORE
THAN
NAMES
HONOURING
PERSONAGES
AND
OF
COURSE
THEY
WOULD
NOT
APPEAR
NEARLY
AS
CONFUSING
TO
ONE
APPROACHING
THE
SPORT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
ANOTHER
THING
THAT
BOTHERS
ME
IS
THE
POINTS
SYSTEM
PERCENTAGES
AS
USED
IN
THE
OTHER
MAJOR
SPORTS
ARE
CLEARLY
MORE
INFORMATIVE
WHEN
I
LOOK
AT
THE
NHL
STANDINGS
THE
FIRST
THING
I
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
MAKE
A
QUICK
CALCULATION
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
GAMES
IN
HAND
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
THE
CASE
SOME
WILL
OBJECT
TO
PERCENTAGES
CLAIMING
PERHAPS
THAT
IT
IS
AN
AMERICANIZATION
OF
THE
SPORT
BUT
I
FEEL
THAT
USING
PERCENTAGES
IS
MORE
INFORMATIVE
AND
WHETHER
IT
IS
AMERICAN
OR
NOT
IS
IRRELEVANT
IF
THE
CURRENT
NAMES
ARE
INAPPROPRIATE
THEN
THAT
IS
A
SEPARATE
ISSUE
NOT
CENTRAL
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
ARTICLE
SOMETHING
TO
CONSIDER
ADDITIONALLY
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
PLAYERS
LIKE
ORR
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
SPORT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
DO
SO
WITHOUT
AN
ORGANIZED
PROFESSIONAL
LEAGUE
TO
PLAY
IN
IN
THIS
CASE
HONOURING
BUILDERS
OF
THE
LEAGUE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
BUILDERS
OF
THE
SPORT
BECOMES
A
CHICKENANDEGG
TYPE
QUESTION
ALTHOUGH
IT
WAS
THE
CHICKEN
EVEN
IF
ORR
COULDNT
HAVE
CONTRIBUTED
WITHOUT
THE
LIKES
OF
NORRIS
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
TO
AGREE
THAT
NORRIS
COULDNT
HAVE
CONTRIBUTED
WITHOUT
THE
LIKES
OF
ORR
AND
TAKING
A
POLL
OF
MOST
FANS
WOULD
QUICKLY
TELL
YOU
WHO
THE
FANS
FEEL
MADE
THE
MORE
MEANINGFUL
CONTRIBUTION
EXACTLY
TRUE
NAMING
DIVISIONS
AND
TROPHIES
AFTER
SMYTHE
AND
THE
BUNCH
IS
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
NEPOTISM
THAT
PUT
STEIN
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
WAS
NONSENSE
DUNNO
IF
THE
STEIN
COMPARISON
IS
JUSTIFIABLE
SINCE
IT
DOESNT
LOOK
AS
THOUGH
HIS
UNANIMOUS
ACCEPTANCE
TO
THE
HALL
WILL
HOLD
UP
IT
DOESNT
LOOK
AS
IF
THE
DIVISION
NAMES
ARE
GOING
TO
HOLD
UP
EITHER
DOES
IT
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
