didnt

every
team
must
have
a
number
of
local
players
rather
the
european
teams
should
get
the
chance
to
sign
their
top
players

comes
in
i
agree
that
birthplace
isnt
that
important
dusseldorfer
eg
of
the
german
league
average
close
to
fans
and
they
dont
have
a
single
germanborn
forward
lion
milan
made
the
european
final
four
with
fifteen
canadianborn
players
but
nationality
is
going
to
be
an
issue
in
sweden
and
finland
i
think
we
really
need
an
issue
preventing
lindros
and
mario
from
ending
up
being
drafted
by
a
european
team
and
vice
versa
player
trades
are
a
different
matter
any
player
can
end
up
anywhere
after
being
drafted
deg
has
many
germanborn
forwards
in
the
team
in
fact
the
majority
of
players
are
germanborn
