coloured
puck

not

in
article

jim
jordan
says
the
precedent
was
set
by
the
wha
in
their
first
season
they
used
a
red
puck
for
exhibition
games
and
a
blue
one
for
the
regular
season
thankfully
they
abandoned
it
in
favour
of
black
before
the
next
season
began
one
reason
that
the
wha
abandoned
the
blue
puck
was
the
fact
that
it
crumbled
very
quickly
during
play
the
blue
dye
that
was
used
somehow
affected
the
vulcanized
rubber
of
the
puck
decreasing
its
cohesiveness
