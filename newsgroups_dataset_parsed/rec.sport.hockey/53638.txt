UPI
MIKE
KEENAN
WHOSE
NHL
COACHING
HISTORY
HAS
BEEN
TO
WEAR
OUT
HIS
WELCOME
DESPITE
AN
IMPRESSIVE
PENCHANT
FOR
WINNING
HAS
COME
TO
THE
CITY
THAT
EMBRACES
VICTORS
ABOVE
ALL
ELSE
WELL
I
COULD
BECOME
A
FAN
SERIOUSLY
THIS
NEWS
COMING
SINCE
THURSDAY
HAS
EFFECTIVELY
ROBBED
THE
ISLANDERS
AND
THE
DEVILS
OF
ANY
AIRTIME
ON
SPORTS
TALK
SHOWS
ALMOST
EVERYWHERE
THAT
IVE
SAMPLED
IN
FACT
THE
PLAYOFFS
ALMOST
DONT
EXIST
NOW
RANGER
FANS
CALLING
IN
TO
WFAN
OR
TO
NEW
YORK
ONES
MIDNIGHT
SPORTS
TALK
WERE
IN
A
MIX
OF
FURY
OVER
THIS
SEASON
AND
NEAR
ORGASM
OVER
KEENANS
HIRING
SUMMARIZING
KEENAN
IS
A
WINNER
AND
WILL
GIVE
THE
BROADWAY
BUMS
DA
BUSINESS
IN
PURSUING
THE
NEXT
CUP
CHASE
THE
CHICAGO
BLACKHAWKS
CUT
THEIR
LAST
TIE
WITH
KEENAN
WHEN
HE
WAS
FORCED
OUT
AS
GENERAL
MANAGER
IN
NOVEMBER
HE
HAD
GIVEN
UP
CHICAGOS
COACHING
DUTIES
A
YEAR
AGO
AND
HIS
THIRST
FOR
THE
POWER
OF
A
GM
NOW
INCREASES
THE
PRESSURE
ON
BELEAGUERED
RANGERS
GM
NEIL
SMITH
THIS
WILL
BE
AN
INTERESTING
COMBINATION
TO
WATCH
KEENAN
HAS
BEEN
PAID
ENOUGH
MONEY
TO
PUT
UP
AND
SHUT
UP
AND
JUST
BE
A
COACH
BUT
HIS
ADVICE
ON
ANY
PLAYER
MOVES
WILL
BE
LISTENED
TO
CLOSELY
A
LOT
OF
BIG
PLAYER
MOVES
WILL
HAPPEN
REMEMBER
THAT
KEENAN
GOT
RID
OF
DENIS
SAVARD
THE
COUNTRY
CLUB
DAYS
ARE
OVER
WHEN
KEENAN
LEFT
CHICAGO
I
COULDNT
HELP
BUT
THINK
ABOUT
HIM
AS
OUR
COACH
SMITH
SAID
THERE
WAS
AN
INDICATION
HE
WOULD
BE
TAKEN
OFF
THE
MARKET
I
FEARED
THAT
AND
COULDNT
LET
THAT
HAPPEN
IF
PARAMOUNT
HAD
GIVEN
SMITH
AN
EARLIER
SIGN
OF
SUPPORT
AND
OFFERED
KEENAN
THE
BIG
MONEY
TO
PUTUPANDSHUTUP
BACK
IN
JANUARY
THE
RANGERS
MIGHT
NOT
BE
HEADING
FOR
GOLF
NOW
KEENAN
TAKES
ON
A
DEMORALIZED
TEAM
THAT
OFFERS
HIM
A
CHANCE
TO
FASHION
YET
ANOTHER
OF
HIS
RECLAMATION
PROJECTS
AT
THE
HIGHEST
SALARY
EVER
COMMANDED
BY
AN
NHL
COACH
THE
RANGERS
OWNED
BY
GULF
WESTERN
HAVE
BESTOWED
UPON
KEENAN
AN
UNPRECEDENTED
MILLION
FOURYEAR
DEAL
IVE
KNOWN
MIKE
A
LONG
TIME
MESSIER
SAID
WEVE
WON
TWO
CANADA
CUPS
TOGETHER
HES
BEEN
TO
THE
FINALS
THREE
TIMES
MAYBE
WE
MISS
JUST
ONE
MORE
ELEMENT
TO
WIN
THE
STANLEY
CUP
I
DONT
THINK
HES
THE
SAME
PERSON
HE
WAS
YEARS
AGO
OR
EVEN
FIVE
YEARS
AGO
I
THINK
HE
HAS
CHANGED
AND
BETTERED
HIMSELF
WITH
EXPERIENCE
ONE
OF
KEENANS
FIRST
STATEMENTS
WAS
A
REAFFIRMATION
THAT
MARK
MESSIER
WILL
BE
THE
TEAMS
CAPTAIN
THE
TIMING
OF
THE
MOVE
GIVES
THE
RANGERS
NEW
COACH
MONTHS
TO
PREPARE
FOR
THE
NHL
DRAFT
JUNE
AND
NEIL
SMITH
MAY
NOT
BACK
OFF
THE
THEIR
TRADEHAPPY
PATTERN
BY
THEN
SMITH
MIGHT
HAVE
SOME
BARGAINS
ON
KEENANS
