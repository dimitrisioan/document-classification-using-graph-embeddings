DAVID
WRITES
IT
WAS
BRYAN
TROTTIER
NOT
DENIS
POTVIN
IT
WAS
A
VICIOUS
BOARDING
FROM
BEHINDTROTTIER
WAS
GIVEN
A
MAJOR
PERHAPS
IT
WAS
TROTTIER
IT
HAPPENED
BEHIND
THE
HABS
GOAL
IF
I
RECALL
GAINEY
SIMPLY
DIDNT
HAVE
HIS
HEAD
UP
AS
HE
WAS
PICKING
UP
THE
PUCK
BUT
ROGER
WHAT
THE
HELL
DOES
THIS
HAVE
TO
DO
WITH
GAINEYS
SKILL
AS
A
HOCKEY
PLAYER
IF
PROBERT
SMASHES
GILMOURS
HEAD
INTO
THE
BOARDS
NEXT
WEEK
WILL
THAT
DIMINISH
YOUR
ASSESSMENT
OF
GILMOURS
SKILLS
IF
GILMOUR
WAS
TAKEN
COMPLETELY
BY
SURPRISE
AS
GAINEY
WAS
THEN
YEAH
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
DOUG
WASNT
PLAYING
TECHNICALLY
SMART
HOCKEY
IN
ANY
CASE
TO
CLAIM
AS
GREG
DID
THAT
GAINEY
NEVER
MADE
A
TECHNICAL
MISTAKE
IS
ABSOLUTELY
LUDICROUS
LATER
ON
IN
YOUR
POSTING
YOU
MAKE
REFERENCE
TO
PUTTING
WORDS
INTO
OTHER
PEOPLES
MOUTHSI
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
YOUR
LAST
PARAGRAPH
CAN
ONLY
BE
INTERPRETED
IN
ONE
WAYNAMELY
THAT
I
ALONG
WITH
GREG
CLAIM
THAT
GAINEY
NEVER
MADE
A
TECHNICAL
MISTAKE
IF
YOU
ACTUALLY
READ
WHAT
IVE
WRITTEN
YOU
WILL
FIND
THAT
I
MAKE
NO
SUCH
CLAIMSOOOO
IF
LOGIC
SERVES
ME
WELL
YOURE
CONTRADICTING
YOURSELF
GAINEY
WAS
A
PLUGGER
AND
WHEN
THE
PRESS
RUNS
OUT
OF
THINGS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THE
STARS
ON
DYNASTIES
THEY
START

SO
ON
I
WOULD
TAKE
FUHR
AND
SANDERSON
OFF
OF
THE
LATTER
GOOD
FOR
YOU
YOUD
ONLY
BE
DISPLAYING
YOUR
IGNORANCE
OF
COURSE
BUT
TO
EACH
HIS
OWN
ROGER
IM
NOT
SURE
HERE
BUT
I
THINK
IGNORANCE
IS
REALLY
A
FUNCTION
OF
A
LACK
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
NOT
FORMULATING
AN
OPINIONBUT
HEY
IF
YOU
NEED
TO
TAKE
A
CHEAP
SHOT
THEN
BY
ALL
MEANS
GO
AHEADTHATS
IF
IT
MAKES
YOU
FEEL
BETTER
I
THINK
GAINEY
WOULD
BE
HONOURED
TO
KNOW
THAT
YOUVE
INCLUDED
HIM
I
THINK
GAINEY
SHOULD
FEEL
HONOURED
TO
KNOW
THAT
HE
IS
REMEMBERED
AT
ALL
MY
WORD
SUCH
VEHEMENCE
AGAINST
POOR
OL
BOB
GAINEY
WHY
DOES
HE
BOTHER
YOU
SO
MUCHHE
WAS
AN
EFFECTIVE
PLAYER
FOR
HIS
STYLE
OF
PLAY
ON
THIS
LIST
I
ALSO
THINK
YOU
HAVE
A
RELATIVELY
NAIVE
VIEW
ABOUT
WHAT
WINS
A
HOCKEY
GAMEPLUGGERS
ARE
AN
INTEGRAL
PART
OF
CERTAINLY
PLUGGERS
ARE
AN
INTEGRAL
PART
OF
ANY
TEAM
AND
THAT
IS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
NOT
ENOUGH
SOLID
TWOWAY
PLAYERS
TO
GO
AROUND
WHO
WOULD
YOU
RATHER
HAVE
AS
YOUR
CHECKING
CENTRE
DOUG
GILMOUR
OR
DOUG
JARVIS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
I
WOULD
TAKE
EITHER
GRETZKY
OR
MARIO
AS
MY
CHECKING
CENTRES
DO
YOU
THINK
GRETZKY
COULD
COVER
BOB
GAINEY
IM
REALLY
SORRY
ROGER
BUT
YOU
HAVE
LOST
ME
COMPLETELY
HERE
WHY
DONT
YOU
ASK
ME
IF
I
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
JESUS
CHRIST
HIMSELF
IN
NETS
NOW
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
COMPARE
SAY
FOR
EXAMPLE
BOB
GAINEY
WITH
GUY
CARBONNEAU
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
A
BALANCED
COMPARISON
ANY
TEAM
THE
SELKE
IS
DESIGNED
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THEIR
CONTRIBUTIONI
THINK
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
UNDERSTAND
THAT
ITS
NOT
THE
NOBEL
PRIZESO
SETTLE
DOWN
YOURE
WRONG
AGAIN
THE
SELKE
IS
AWARDED
TO
THE
FORWARD
THAT
DOES
THE
BEST
JOB
DEFENSIVELY
AND
THIS
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
THE
BEST
PLUGGER
IF
GILMOUR
DOES
THE
BEST
DEFENSIVE
JOB
IN
THE
LEAGUE
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
HE
SHOULD
BE
OUT
OF
THE
RUNNING
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
HE
ALSO
CONTRIBUTES
OFFENSIVELY
IM
WRONG
AGAINHMMM
LETS
SEEWHERE
WAS
I
WRONG
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IM
ONLY
GUESSING
HERE
ROG
BUT
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THAT
YOUVE
SETUP
A
YOURE
WRONG
AGAIN
MACRO
KEY
ON
YOUR
MACHINE
I
AGREE
THAT
MY
USE
OF
THE
WORD
PLUGGER
IS
SIMPLISTICBUT
I
THINK
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
IM
GETTING
AT
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
GILMOURS
POTENTIAL
AS
A
SELKEWINNER
WAS
NEVER
PART
OF
THE
DEBATEARE
YOU
ASKING
ME
FOR
AN
OPINION
IF
SO
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
FAR
TOO
MANY
OTHER
DESERVING
PLAYERS
TO
INCLUDE
GILMOUR
AMONG
THE
CANDIDATES
SETTLE
DOWN
IF
YOU
THINK
THAT
I
HAVE
LIKENED
THE
SELKE
TO
THE
NOBEL
PRIZE
THEN
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
HAD
BEST
SETTLE
DOWN
AND
IF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
TRY
TO
PUT
WORDS
IN
MY
MOUTH
LET
ME
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
SETTLE
DOWN
BEFORE
YOU
BOTHER
FOLLOWING
UP
ON

WOULD
