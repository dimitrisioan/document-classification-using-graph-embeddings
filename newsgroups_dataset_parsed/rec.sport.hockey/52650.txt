HRIVNAK
OR
TABARACCI
AFTER
SEEING
HRIVNAK
AND
TABARRACI
PLAY
WHO
WOULD
YOU
PREFER
TO
HAVE
AND
HOW
ABOUT
TYLER
LARTER
WHAT
EVER
HAPPENED
TO
HIM
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
MY
ANSWER
WILL
BE
HRIVNAK
THE
CHOICE
IS
OBVIOUS
OK
BUT
HAVE
YOU
SEEN
TABARACCI
PLAY
YET
IN
HIS
TWO
STARTS

RELIEF
EFFORT
FOR

HAS
LOOKED
MIGHTY
SHARP
DONT
FORGET
THE
SHUTOUT
I
THINK
HES
LET
IN
JUST
FOUR
GOALS
OVER
EIGHT
PERIODS
OF
PLAY
I
LIKE
HRIVNAK
BUT
WE
MIGHT
ACTUALLY
HAVE
TO
GIVE
SOME
CREDIT
TO
DAVID
POILE
FOR
A
CHANGE
AFTER
THIS
TRADE
HOPEFULLY
IF
TABARACCI
STARTS
AGAINST
THE
ISLES
TONIGHT
