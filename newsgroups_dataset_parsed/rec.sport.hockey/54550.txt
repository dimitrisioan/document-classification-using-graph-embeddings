rumor
has
it
here
in
pittsburgh
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
penguins
broadcasting
change
before
next
season
according
to
the
rumor
the
kbl
leadership
the
company
the
broadcasts
the
pens
games
wants
to
limit
loved
broadcaster
mike
lange
to
radio
only
and
hire
don
cherry
as
his
broadcast
partner
this
would
mean
paul
stiegerwald
would
be
fired
good
riddance
does
anyone
know
anything
about
this
lange
is
a
fun
broadcaster
to
listen
to
and
pens
games
wouldnt
be
the
same
without
him
also
i
hear
cherry
doesnt
have
high
opinions
of
lemieux
ulf
sammuelsson
or
jaromir
jagr
how
is
he
supposed
to
broadcast
their
games
i
believe
that
the
large
number
of
digits
on
his
paycheck
and
it
would
not
be
binary
would
help
don
to
be
a
fan
of
ulf
jaro
and
mario

lifetime
penguins
fan
even
from
before
they
were
