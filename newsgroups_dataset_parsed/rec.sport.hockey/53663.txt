RANDY
A
GRACA
WRITES
I
ALSO
THINK
THAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
WITH
PITTSBURGH
IF
THEY
FACE
THEM
IN
THE
FINALS
WHICH
IS
WHAT
ALL
THE
DETROIT
SPORTSWRITERS
ARE
PREDICTING
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
BRYAN
MURRAY
IS
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
GM
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN
IN
HOCKEY
HOW
DO
YOU
FIGURE
THAT
WHEN
BRYAN
MURRAY
TOOK
OVER
THE
WINGS
THEY
WERE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
TEAM
THAT
WAS
CONTENDING
FOR
THE
STANLEY
CUP
BUT
LOOKED
UNLIKELY
TO
WIN
IT
NOW
THEY
ARE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
TEAM
THAT
IS
CONTENDING
FOR
THE
STANLEY
CUP
BUT
LOOKS
UNLIKELY
TO
WIN
IT
A
TRULY
GREAT
GM
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
MAKE
THE
MOVES
TO
PUSH
THE
TEAM
TO
THE
UPPER
ECHELON
OF
THE
NHL
AND
MAYBE
WIN
THE
STANLEY
CUP
A
GOOD
GM
LIKE
MURRAY
CAN
MAINTAIN
THE
TEAMS
SUCCESS
BUT
CANT
PUSH
THEM
TO
THE
NEXT
LEVEL
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
HOCKEY
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
SEVERAL
BETTER
GMS
THAN
MURRAY
WAY
TOO
MANY
TO
NAME
MURRAY
ISNT
EVEN
THE
BEST
GM
IN
THE
LEAGUE
TODAY
HE
FAILS
IN
COMPARISON
TO
SINDEN
SATHER
SAVARD
CARON
FLETCHER
AND
QUINN
IN
MY
ESTIMATION
I
CANT
IMAGINE
HOW
BRYAN
MURRAY
CAN
BE
THE
BEST
GM
ANYONE
HAS
EVER
SEEN
IN
HOCKEY
UNLESS
THEY
HAVE
SEEN
VERY
FEW
GMS
