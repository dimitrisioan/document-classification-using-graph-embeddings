WRITES
THE
PRESENCE
OF

TEAM
IN
MIAMII
CANT

SOUTH
FLORIDA
ITS
TOO
LONG
MAKES
ME
THINK
OF
AN
INTERESTING
QUESTION
CAN
YOU
SELL
THE
HISPANIC
COMMUNITY
ON
HOCKEY
MIAMI
IS
HISPANIC
THIS
COMMUNITY
HAS
NO
EXPERIENCE
AND
NO
PREVIOUS
EXPOSURE
TO
HOCKEY
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
THE
TEAMS
IN
NY
AND
LA
WHICH
ALSO
HAVE
BIG
HISPANIC
GROUPS
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
TRY
TO
WOO
THIS
GROUP
WHAT
WILL
MIAMI
DO
COULD
THEY
GET
SPANISHLANGUAGE
TV
AND
RADIO
COVERAGE
I
THINK
AS
DO
THE
OWNERS
THAT
HOCKEY
WILL
DO
WELL
IN
MIAMI
SINCE
THERE
IS
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
FROM
THE
NORTHEAST
THAT
SPEND
THEIR
WINTERS
IN
FLORIDA
EVERY
YEAR
AS
FOR
THE
COVERAGE
SOMEONE
WILL
HAVE
TO
COME
UP
WITH
SOME
MONEY
FOR
THAT
SINCE
BROADCAST
RIGHTS
CAN
BE
EXPENSIVE
