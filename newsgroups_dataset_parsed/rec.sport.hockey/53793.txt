IF
YOU
WERE

BURNS
WHAT
ARE
THE
LEAFS
TO
DO
I
AM
A
LEAF
SUPPORTER
AND
I
SAY
THE
LEAFS
ARE
GOING
DOWN
IN
FOUR
UNLESS
THERE
IS
NOTHING
SHORT
OF
A
MIRACLE
OR
A
STROKE
OF
GENENIUS

IF

WERE

WHAT
WOULD
YOU
DO
LIVING
IN
THE

I
DO
NOT
GET
ENOUGH
LEAF
COVERAGE
TO
PULL
SOMETHING
OUT
OF
THE
BAG
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
COMMENTS
ON
THE

LINE
MATCHUPS
BUT
HERE
IS
THE
BASIC
IDEA
ANDREYCHUCK
AND
BORCHEVSKY
HAVE
NO
BUSINESS
PLAYING
AGAINST
THE
WINGS
THEY
ARE
TOO
SMALL
THE
KEY
TO
ANY
LEAFS
SUCCESS
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
CLARK
HE
IS
THE
ONLY
CENTRE
WHO
CAN
HAVE
ANY
PRESENCE
WITHIN
LENGTHS
OF
THE
SLOT
WHERE
THE
HELL
IS
ANDERSON
ANDERSON
CAN
IN
DAYS
PAST
GET
UNDER
PEOPLES
SKIN
PUT
A
LITTLE
MORE
BLUNTLY
ANDERSON
HAS
TO
BE
AN
ASSHOLE
HE
USED
TO
BE
GOOD
AT
IT
WE
NEED
HIM
NOW
PERHAPS
PERHAPS
THE
LEAFS
CAN
SHUT
DOWN
DETROITS
SECOND

I
WAS
DISSAPPOINTED
TO
SEE
SHEPARD
AND
YSERBEART
FLYING
LAST
NIGHT
THESE
GUYS
ARE
THE
SWING
PLAYERS
FOR
THE
WINGS
LAST
YEAR
THEY
DID
A
MAJOR
CHOKE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
AND
WERE
TO
BLAME
FOR
THE
QUICK
EXIT
OF
THE
WINGS
THIS
HAS
TO
HAPPEN
AGAIN
