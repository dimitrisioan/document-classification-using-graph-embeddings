although
perhaps
i
shouldnt

a

at
all
i
have
been
accused
of
knocking
on
wood
too
much
you
nah
he
was
seriously
unimpressive
even
as
a
tough
guy
his
rep
however
as
few
games
as
he
had
in
a
season
that
was
at
that
point
meaningless
i
hate
to
judge
the
talent
too
quickly
butn
in
dodys

im
tempted
to
make
an
exception

wood
played
most
of
his
junior
career
in
seattle
he
was
one
of
the
leading
scorers
on
a
mediocre
team
when
he
was
traded
away
in
he
rarely
lost
a
fight
and
was
one
of
the
toughest
players
in
the
whl
however
i
was
extremely
surprised
when
he
was
drafted
especially
in
the
third
round
he
certainly
didnt
look
