paul
stewart
is
the
worst
and
most
biased
ref
presently
in
the
nhl
we
was
robbed
no
patrick
roy
is
the
reason
the
game
was
lost
and
ron
hextall
is
the
reason
quebec
won
i
dont
buy
this
at
all
roy
was
the
reason
the
game
was
tied
and
that
would
not
have
been
the
case
had
dionne
kept
his
cool
roy
stood
on
his
head
for
the
first
minutes
of
the
game
when
the
nords
were
rushing
from
endtoend
kamenskys
minibreak
after
the
tying
goal
and
the
first
shot
by
young
in
ot
were
both
excellent
chances
stopped
by
roy
roy
outplayed
hextall
for
most
of
the
game
but
roy
becomes
the
villain
and
hextall
the
hero
because
roys
team
didnt
make
full
use
of
their
opportunities
whoa
what
you
are
effectively
doing
is
implying
that
if
a
player
plays
really
well
he
stores
up
mistakes
that
can
be
used
at
a
later
time
ths
is
not
so
roy
is
the
villain
as
you
so
succinctly
put
it
because
he
allowed
a
very
cheap
goal
if
you
think
roy
outplayed
hextall
perhaps
you
should
get
a
tape
of
the
game
and
watch
the
first
minutes
of
the
third
period
nhl
goaltenders
make
some
great
saves
if
they
did
not
they
would
not
be
in
the
nhl
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
expect
any
particular
goalie
to
be
able
to
make
the
great
saves
all
of
the
time
even
though
they
are
occasionally
required
however
when
it
comes
to
a
routine
shot
like
sakics
especially
at
such
a
crucial
time
in
a
game
i
dont
think
there
are
any
legitimate
excuses
hextall
on
the
other
hand
had
a
lot
of
lucky
bounces
description
of
lucky
bounces
hextall
wasnt
particularly
brilliant
on
those
plays
i
am
not
arguing
that
hextall
was
brilliant
i
am
arguing
is
that
a
relatively
weak
wrist
shot
from
the
outside
of
the
circle
shold
not
result
in
a
goal
but
it
was
just
the
goal
the
timing
stank
but
against
an
explosive
team
like
quebec
they
gave
them
opportunity
too
many
with
a
powerplay
that
was
totally
unnecessary
in
a
onegoal
game
with
less
than
a
minute
to
go
there
is
no
such
thing
as
just
the
goal
i
have
not
defended
dionne
for
taking
the
penalty
eitherin
fact
i
think
it
was
a
boneheaded
move
but
it
led
to
one
goal
only
and
montreal
had
a
two
goal
lead
my
main
concern
is
the
second
goal
this
most
certainly
was
a
team
loss
leclair
missed
his
opportunities
as
did
bellows
and
brunet
dionne
took
a
bad
penalty
damphousse
and
lebeau
were
silent
carbonneau
and
savard
were
a
step
behind
all
night
roy
gave
up
the
bad
goal
roy
by
no
means
can
be
singled
out
for
this
loss
what
you
say
about
the
skaters
is
absolutely
true
but
realize
that
the
game
was
effectively
won
you
could
watch
any
hockey
game
in
fact
you
could
watch
any
sporting
event
period
and
spend
hours
discussing
the
what
ifs
wrt
missed
opportunities
they
are
not
important
when
the
final
result
is
decided
if
i
get
the
time
soon
ill
watch
the
game
again
and
email
you
a
list
of
lucky
montreal
bounces
and
a
list
of
quebec
offensive
screwups
montreal
was
leading
with
a
minute
to
go
the
goalie
is
the
last
line
of
defence
and
i
will
grant
that
extra
attention
is
focussed
on
him
sometimes
without
justification
but
roy
gave
up
a
lousy
goal
and
a
team
cannot
afford
such
a
goal
roy
looked
like
a
player
in
an
industrial
league
on
sakics
shot
and
hextall
didnt
on
dionnes
goal
please
who
cares
of
what
value
is
it
to
justify
one
lousy
play
with
a
totally
unrelated
lousy
play
i
could
do
a
hextall
critique
if
youd
like
but
if
youre
going
to
assess
his
performance
keep
in
mind
that
he
made
the
key
saves
at
the
key
times
roy
is
paid
big
money
because
that
is
his
value
compared
to
other
goalies
and
he
still
is
in
the
top
for
the
record
i
did
not
say
that
roy
was
not
one
of
the
top
goaltenders
in
the
league
in
fact
i
agree
that
he
is
the
montreal
media
is
the
quickest
to
heap
praise
and
then
hurl
derogatory
comments
against
the
habs
they
are
no
better
than
uninformed
fans
i
assume
you
are
referring
to
me
however
i
have
pointed
out
that
i
think
the
loss
can
be
blamed
on
roy
i
have
not
said
he
sucks
nor
do
i
think
ive
made
any
other
derogatory
comments
if
you
regard
objective
and
informed
fyi
observations
as
derogatory
i
really
cant
help
you
