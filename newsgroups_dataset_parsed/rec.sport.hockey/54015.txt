heres
one
from
the
mill
the
oilers
might
move
to
hamilton
where
porklington
can
get
a
free
deal
the
probability
is
that
the
oilers
are
not
going
anywhere
pocklington
has
chosen
this
moment
to
make
his
last
stand
is
because
he
is
at
the
moment
of
maximum
advantagethe
provincial
government
is
months
away
from
a
provincial
electionit
is
the
moment
when
he
has
maximum
power
to
convince
northlands
to
give
him
a
better
arena
deal
or
a
better
purchase
price
and
it
is
before
the
nhls
new
collective
agreement
with
the
players
which
might
involve
some
enhanced
revenuesharing
pocklington
is
many
thingsstupid
is
not
one
of
them
he
can
dictate
termsbecause
other
cities
will
pay
his
price
if
edmonton
doesnt
edmonton
has
already
fucked
up
its
international
airport
and
surrendered
supremacy
to
calgary
and
over
the
next
few
years
edmonton
is
going
to
take
a
hard
hit
from
government
cutbacks
it
will
screw
itself
beyond
recogniton
if
it
manages
to
find
a
way
to
lose
its
hockey
team
toobecause
northlands
wants
to
continue
to
use
the
oilers
to
subsidize
horse
racing
however
in
this
case
about
the
longterm
financial
viability
of
the
oilers
the
fact
is
that
pocklington
is
basically
right
regardless
of
who
owns
the
team
and
it
is
right
to
provoke
the
crisis
now
before
the
team
accumulates
millions
of
dollars
in
losses
or
becomes
habitually
uncompetitive
because
of
lack
of
money
sather
has
done
his
jobthe
oilers
are
poised
to
be
competitive
again
very
soon
