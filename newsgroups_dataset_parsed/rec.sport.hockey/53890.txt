wear
when
he
played
with
the
rangers
in
the
this
was
the
season
that
they
put
the
rangers
crest
and
modernstyle
numbers
on
the
jerseys
instead
of
the
new
york
or
rangers
block
letters
and
twocolour
numbers
he
took
because
the
rangers
already
had
a
hockey
night
in
canada
made
a
big
thing
out
of
it
saying
it
was
the
