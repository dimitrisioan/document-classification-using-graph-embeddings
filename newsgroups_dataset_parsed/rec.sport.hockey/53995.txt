sabre
fans
yes
yes
i
can
see
it
now
all
those
sabre
fans
finally
taking
their
sabre
sweaters
out
of
the
moth
balls
and
proudly
wearing
them
after
years
of
playoff
frustration
and
being
up
games
to
nil
i
guess
it
is
a
pretty
good
bet
but
there
has
not
been
a
team
that
has
come
back
from
an
deficit
since
could
this
be
the
year
dont
throw
out
the
moth
balls
yet
