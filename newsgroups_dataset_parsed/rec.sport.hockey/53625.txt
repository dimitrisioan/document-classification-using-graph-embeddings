VLADIMIR
ZHIVOV
SAYS
IN
ROBBIE
PO
WRITES
WINGS
VS
LEAFS
MAPLE
LEAFS
IN
COMMENT
ITS
KIND
OF
TOUGH
TO
RELY
ON
YZERMAN
AS
THE
TEAMS
MAIN
WEAPON
HES
A
GREAT
PALYER
BUT
DINO
KNOWS
ALL
ABOUT
CHOKING
WHICH
PUTS
THE
BURDEN
ON
STEVE
EVEN
MORE
POTVINS
HAD
A
HELL
OF
A
SEASON
AND
GOALTENDING
IS
WHAT
YOU
NEED
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
FOR
A
GREAT
PROGNOSTICATOR
YOU
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
VERY
LITTLE
PLAYOFF
HISTORY
DINO
ALWAYS
SHOWS
UP
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
WHICH
IS
WHY
HE
IS
A
GREAT
SLEEPER
PICK
IN
POOLS
DONT
FORGET
ABOUT
FEDOROV
ONE
OF
THE
TOP
PLAYERS
IN
THE
NHL
IMHO
AND
COFFEY
WHO
HAS
THE
MOST
STANLEY
CUP
RINGS
OF
ANY
ACTIVE
PLAYERS
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
WINGS
IN
A
CAKEWALK
OH
YEAH
HOW
COME
DINO
COULD
NEVER
TAKE
THE
CAPS
OUT
OF
THE
PATRICK
DIVISION
HE
CHOKED
UP
GAMES
TO
LAST
YEAR
AND
GOT
SWEPT
AWAY
IN
THE
SECOND
ROUND
TWO
YEARS
AGO
HE
RARELY
IF
EVER
MAKES
IT
OUT
OF
THE
DIVISION
VS
CANUCKS
IN
COMMENT
ITS
MORE
LIKE
VANCOUVER
VS
SELANNE
KING
AND
DOMI
FOR
ENFORCING
HELP
WINNIPEG
OUT
A
LITTLE
MAYBE
A
GAME
CANUCKS
HAVE
THEIR
NUMBER
EXCEPT
THAT
THE
CANUCK
ARE
PLAYING
LIKE
SHIT
WINNIPEG
CAN
WIN
THIS
ONE
THOUGH
I
THINK
VANCOUVER
WILL
MANAGE
TO
SLIP
BY
SO
ARE
THE
ISLANDERS
BUT
THEY
CAN
STILL
PULL
IT
OUT
VANCOUVER
HAS
WINNIPEGS
NUMBER
SO
IT
REALLY
DOESNT
MATTER
VS
FLAMES
IN
COMMENT
GAMES
LOOKS
GOOD
AS
THE
KINGS
ALWAYS
SEEM
TO
BATTLE
IT
OUT
FLAMES
ARE
BACK
IN
RUNNING
AND
WONT
KNOW
MEMORIES
OF
LAST
YEARS
SEASON
GRETZKY
IS
ON
A
TEAR
BUT
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
SURROUNDING
THE
KINGS
KINGS
ALWAYS
SEEM
TO
BATTLE
IT
OUT
WHEN
WHERE
KINGS
ALWAYS
SEEM
TO
GO
AT
LEAST
OR
THEY
NEVER
PLAY
A
FOUR
OR
FIVE
GAME
SERIOUS
THERES
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
BATTLING
IT
OUT
AND
PULLING
IT
OUT
AS
I
TAKE
CALGARY
TO
PULL
IT
OUT
IN
ROBBIE
