DID
ANYONE
ELSE
SEE
THIS
GAME
LAST
NIGHT
JUST
LIKE
A
PLAYOFF
GAME
LOTS
OF
HITTINGBUT
I
WAS
DISAPPOINTED
BY
THE
VIDEO
GOAL
JUDGE
ON
ALL
REPLAYS
JOE
MURPHYS
GOAL
SHOULDNT
HAVE
COUNTED
IT
DIDNT
GO
IN
NET
AND
ACCORDING
TO
THE
TSN
BROADCASTERS
THE
VIDEO
GOAL
JUDGE
SAID
THAT
HE
SAW
THE
WATER
BOTTLE
ON
TOP
OF
THE
CAGE
MOVE
SO
HE
ASSUMED
THE
PUCK
WENT
IN
THIS
IS
TERRIBLEHOPE
CRAP
LIKE
THIS
DOESNT
OCCUR
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
THE
GAME
WOULD
HAVE
ENDED
IN
TIE
I
THOUGHT
THE
RED
LIGHT
WENT
ONTHUS
IN
THE
REVIEW
THE
PRESUMPTION
WOULD
BE
TO
FIND
CONCLUSIVE
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
PUCK
DID
NOT
GO
IN
THE
NETFROM
THE
REPLAYS
I
SAY
EVEN
FROM
THE
REAR
THE
EVIDENCE
WASNT
CONCLUSIVE
THAT
THE
PUCK
WAS
IN
OR
OUTIN
MY
OPINION
IT
SEEMED
PRETTY
CONCLUSIVE
TO
ME
THE
PUCK
CLEARLY
HIT
THE
CROSSBAR
AND
THEN
CAME
DOWN
ON
THE
LINE
AND
THE
ANNOUNCERS
ADMITTEDLY
HOMERS
KEPT
HARPING
ABOUT
HOW
THEY
MUST
HAVE
HAD
A
DIFFERENT
VIEW
UPSTAIRS
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
OBVIOUS
TO
THEM
AND
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
TO
ANYONE
WHO
SAW
THE
REPLAY
THAT
THE
PUCK
DIDNT
GO
IN
THE
REFEREE
ORIGINALLY
SIGNALLED
NO
GOAL
BUT
THE
VIDEO
REPLAY
JUDGES
INITIATED
CONTACT
WITH
THE
REFEREE
TO
CLAIM
THAT
A
GOAL
WAS
IN
FACT
SCORED
THIS
TO
ME
IS
UNHEARD
OF
SEEING
STUFF
LIKE
THIS
HAPPEN
GIVES
ME
A
BAD
FEELING
ABOUT
THE
LEAF
CHANCES
THIS
YEAR
CORDIALLY

ALWAYS
