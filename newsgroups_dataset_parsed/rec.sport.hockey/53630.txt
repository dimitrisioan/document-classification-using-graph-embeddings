trade
away
a

star
admittedly
his

trades
have
been
good
ones

how
long
before
his

runs
out
and
he
starts
making
espositofor
ratelle
type
trades
again
how
was
this
trade
bad
i
seem
to
recall
ratelle
and
middleton
making
a
pretty
good
centre
right
wing
combination
and
the
bruins
also
got
brad
park
in
the
deal
and
they
also
lost
vadnais
and
somebody
else
after
the
trade
the
bruins
were
in
two
finals
and
one
semifinal
all
of
which
of
course
they
lost
to
montreal
which
should
please
you
to
no
end
i
doubt
however
keeping
esposito
would
have
made
a
difference
in
those
series
as
he
did
not
for
the
rangers
in
or
any
of
his
years
