RE
POTVIN
AND
HIS
STICK
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
DINO
GETTING
SHOTS
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
HE
SHOULD
EXPECT
IT
THIS
IS
PLAYOFF
HOCKEY
WHERE
ANYTHING
GOES
YOU
LOSE
ONE
GAME
IN
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
AND
ITS
NOT
SO
BAD
YOU
LOSE
A
GAME
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
AND
ITS
A
DIFFICULT
THING
TO
OVERCOME
IVE
WATCHED
HOCKEY
AND
PLAYED
IT
TOO
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
AND
I
HAVENT
SEEN
ONE
POSTSEASON
GAME
WHERE
THE
FORWARD
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
HAS
NOT
FINISHED
WITHOUT
ANY
BRUISES
ON
THE
BACK
OF
HIS
LEG
THE
LEAFS
ARE
NOT
DOING
A
GOOD
JOB
IN
CLEARING
THE
NET
AND
POTVIN
HAS
BEEN
FORCED
TO
TAKE
MATTERS
INTO
HIS
OWN
HANDS
I
REMEMBER
WHEN
CICARELLI
USED
TO
PLAY
FOR
THE
LONDON
KNIGHTS
OHL
HE
ALWAYS
WAS
A
NUISANCE
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
AND
THE
GOALIES
TOOK
EXCEPTION
TO
THIS
HE
ALSO
COMPLAINED
IN
THIS
MORNINGS
PAPER
ABOUT
WHAT
HAPPENED
LAST
NIGHT
BUT
TO
ME
ITS
A
LOT
OF
BELLYACHING
HIS
TEAM
IS
UP
AND
HE
COMPLAINS
ABOUT
BEING
WHACKEDI
WONDER
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
HE
TRIED
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THING
IN
FRONT
OF
BILLY
SMITH
OR
A
YOUNGER
RON
HEXTALL
SEEMS
DINO
WOULD
NEED
TWO
ARTIFICAL
LEGS
DINO
SHOULD
TAKE
IT
AS
PART
OF
THE
GAME
AND
THANK
HIS
LUCKY
STARS
THAT
HES
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
AND
HAS
A
GOOD
CHANCE
TO
GO
THE
FINALS
WELL
I
AGREE
THAT
IF
YOURE
GOING
TO
STAND
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
EXPECT
TO
GET
HIT
AND
HACKED
AT
IN
GENERAL
YOU
SHOULD
EXPECT
TO
FINISH
THE
GAME
WITH
SOME
BRUISES
HOWEVER
THERE
IS
A
FINE
LINE
BETWEEN
HACKING
AT
A
GUY
CAUSING
SOME
PAIN
AND
DISCOMFORT
AND
BLATANTLY
ATTEMPTING
TO
INJURE
ANOTHER
PLAYER
FELIX
POTVIN
IMO
CROSSED
THAT
LINE
ON
WEDNESDAY
THAT
TWO
HANDER
ON
CICCARELLI
WAS
WAY
OUT
OF
LINE
I
LOST
A
LOT
OF
RESPECT
FOR
POTVIN
BECAUSE
OF
THAT
IT
SHOWED
AN
IMMATURITY
HE
DID
NOT
SLASH
AT
CICCARELLI
TO
SIMPLY
TRY
TO
REMOVE
HIM
FROM
THE
SLOT
AREA
A
LEGAL
POSITION
FOR
DINO
TO
BE
IN
INSTEAD
HE
SLASHED
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
INJURE
IT
WAS
OUT
OF
SHEAR
FRUSTRATION
AS
A
LEAF
SUPPORTER
JUST
A
SUPPORTER
IM
NOT
A
LEAF
FAN
REALLY
I
WAS
VERY
DISAPPOINTED
YOURE
RIGHT
IN
MENTIONING
BILLY
SMITH
AND
RON
HEXTALL
AT
LEAST
IN
HIS
PHILLY
DAYS
THEY
BOTH
CROSSED
THAT
SAME
LINE
AT
TIMES
AND
FOR
THAT
REASON
MANY
FANS
AND
PLAYERS
DISLIKED
THEM
THATS
WHY
THEIR
NAMES
ALWAYS
COMES
UP
AS
EXAMPLES
WHEN
WE
TALK
ABOUT
THESE
ISSUES
LETS
HOPE
THAT
FELIX
DOESNT
DO
THAT
AGAIN
ID
HATE
TO
SEE
ANYONE
EVEN
DINO
ALTHOUGH
I
ADMIT
I
DONT
LIKE
HIM
VERY
MUCH
GET
SERIOUSLY
HURT
FROM
SUCH
CARELESS
BUT
INTENTIONAL
USE
OF
THE
STICK
GARY
