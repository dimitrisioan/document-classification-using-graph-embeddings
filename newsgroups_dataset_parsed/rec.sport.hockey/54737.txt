OKAY
THE
CAPS
AGAIN
ARE
ABOUT
TO
BREAK
OUT
THE
GOLF
CLUBS

DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
WASHINGTON
CAPITALS
FUTILITY
RECORD
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
I
REMEMBER
THAT
TERRYS
FIRST
YEAR
WAS
THE
FIRST
YEAR
THAT
THE
CAPS
FINALLY
MADE
IT
TO
THE
THIRD
ROUND
BUT
BEFORE
UNDER
BRIAN
I
NOTICED
THAT
EVERY
OTHER
YEAR
THE
CAPS
GOT
TO
THE
SECOND
ROUND
AND
THE
YEARS
IN
BETWEEN
THEY
DIDNT
MAKE
IT
PAST
THE
FIRST
ROUND
IS
THIS
TREND
CONTINUNING
THIS
IS
NOT
A
TREND
THE
CAPS
WERE
DONE
GONESO
IN
FIVE
GAMES
AND
IT
SAVES
US
CAPS
FANS
A
LOT
OF
PAIN
I
MEAN
IT
WOULD
BE
MORE
PAINFUL
IF
THE
CAPS
WERE
UP
WATCHING
THEM
TUMBLED

NEED
ONE
MORE
WIN

LOST

WITH

THEY
WERE
A
PITIFUL
THE
LONE

BEING
A
SWEEP
OF
PHILLY
IN
THE
