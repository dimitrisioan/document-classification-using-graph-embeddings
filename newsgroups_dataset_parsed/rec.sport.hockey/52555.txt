and
theyre
off
well
i
gotta
tell
ya
last
nights
leafs
game
vs
the
devils
was
a
nailbitter
let
me
tell
you
it
was
a
well
played
game
by
both
teams
i
thought
but
according
to
the
don
and
ron
it
was
the
an
offnight
for
the
leafs
and
the
devils
were
outplaying
toronto
well
i
beg
to
differ
imho
clark
deserved
to
be
a
first
star
as
much
as
gilmour
did
his
fast
breaks
towards
the
net
and
the
good
opportunites
that
he
created
reminded
me
of
the
clark
of
old
but
not
to
take
any
of
the
credit
away
from
gilmour
i
think
the
leafs
are
playing
great
hockey
why
well
first
look
at
their
injury
list
which
includes
cullen
ellet
zezel
macoun
of
course
my
question
is
thishow
will
the
leafs
fare
when
they
are
once
again
healthy
if
they
are
playing
this
well
so
far
second
just
look
at
their
standings
still
second
in
defence
moved
from
overall
to
over
in
the
last
month
havent
lost
at
home
in
last
games
game
undefeated
streaketc
btw
am
i
wrong
or
was
this
potvins
first
shutout
i
cant
remember
him
having
any
as
of
yet
well
as
of
april
we
see
that
the
race
for
first
in
the
norris
has
truly
begun
and
it
will
be
a
very
close
race
between
chicago
and
toronto
and
the
best
game
of
the
season
will
probably
be
their
last
against
each
other
is
anyone
lucky
enough
to
have
tickets
to
see
this
one
coming
to
the
stretch
and
still
a
roarin
