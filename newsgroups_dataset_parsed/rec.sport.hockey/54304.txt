HEY
I
AM
IN
IOWA
AND
I
DO
NOT
MIND
ESPN
SHOWING
THE
PITTNJD
GAMES
CYT
AT

I
GET
TO
SEE
THE
DEVILSEVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
GETTIN
THERE
ASS
CYT
KICKED
PERHAPS
THEY
WILL
SCORE
AND
EVEN
WIN
A
GAME
OR
TWO
CYT
GO
DEVILS
I
AM
SORRY
TO
TELL
YOU
THIS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THE
DEVILS
WILL
WIN
A
GAME
AGAINST
PITTSBURG
THE
PENGUINS
HAVE
SO
MANY
SCORING
THREATS
THAT
YOU
SHUT
DOWN
ONE
AND
ANOTHER
WILL
KILL
YOU
ITS
TOO
BAD
BUT
I
MUST
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
PENGUINS
WILL
WIN
THEIR
THIRD
STANLEY
CUP
IN
A
ROW
I
HOPE
SOMEONE
WILL
BEAT
THEM
BUT
I
JUST
CANNOT
SEE
IT
HAPPENING
