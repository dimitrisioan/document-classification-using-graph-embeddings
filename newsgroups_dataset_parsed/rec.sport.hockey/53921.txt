HOCKEY
THE
HISPANIC
COMMUNITY
RELYING
ON
CANADIAN
TOURISTS
AND
TRANSPLANTED
NORTHEASTERNERS
TO
SUPPORT
A
TEAM
IN
MIAMI
IS
CRAZY
ESPAECIALLY
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
REALLY
DESERVING
CITIES
WITHOUT
A
TEAM
SUCH
AS
SAN
DIEGO
MILWAUKEE
I
WISH
THE
PANTHERS
OR
WHATEVER
THEIR
NAME
IS
WELL
BUT
IF
THEY
CANT
SELL
TO
HISPANICS
THEYRE
IN
DEEP
DOODOO
ALREADY
THERE
ARE
RUMORS
THAT
TAMPA
MAY
MOVE
TO
MILWAUKEE
