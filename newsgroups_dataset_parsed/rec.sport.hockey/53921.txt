hockey
the
hispanic
community
relying
on
canadian
tourists
and
transplanted
northeasterners
to
support
a
team
in
miami
is
crazy
espaecially
when
you
have
really
deserving
cities
without
a
team
such
as
san
diego
milwaukee
i
wish
the
panthers
or
whatever
their
name
is
well
but
if
they
cant
sell
to
hispanics
theyre
in
deep
doodoo
already
there
are
rumors
that
tampa
may
move
to
milwaukee
