AM
ORIGINALLY
FROM
NEW
YORK
STATE
AND
I
GO
TO
SCHOOL
IN
NORTH
CAROLINA
YET
I
DONT
CONSTANTLY
GRIPE
ABOUT
THE
LACK
OF
HOCKEY
WOULDNT
SOME
OF
YOU
WHO
CHOSE
TO
GO
TO
SCHOOL
IN
THE
SOUTH
REALIZE
MOST
WHO
GRIPE
ARE
CLEMSON
STUDENTS
THAT
HOCKEY
ISNT
QUITE
AS
POPULAR
IN
SOUTH
CAROLINA
WHEN
YOU
CHOSE
A
SCHOOL
WHY
DID
YOU
ALL
EXCUSE
ME
YALL
CHOOSE
SCHOOLS
IN
THE
SOUTH
IF
HOCKEY
WAS
THIS
IMPORTANT
TO
YOU
NOT
EVERYONE
HAS
THE
LUXURY
OF
DECIDING
ON
A
COLLEGE
BY
MAKING
SURE
THE
HOCKEY
COVERAAGE
IS
WHAT
YOU
WANT
IT
TO
BE
I
AM
A
PITTSBURGH
TRANSPLAN
TO
S
C
WHEN
AT
HOME
AND
THE
COVERAAGE
SUCKS
SPORTS
SOUTH
DIDNT
EVEN
SHOW
THE
FINAL
GAME
OF
THE
STANLEY
CUP
LAAST
YEAR
WHILE
IT
WAS
HAPPENING
THEY
PUT
IT
ON
KTAPE
DELAY
AND
CUT
THE
INTERMISSIONS
THEN
WENT
OFF
THE
AIR
WHEN
YOU
MOVE
YOU
TAKE
THE
GOOD
WITH
THE
BAD
AND
DEAL
WITH
IT
IT
DOESNT
MEAN
THAAT
YOU
CANT
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
IT
I
WAS
TRANSPLANTED
BY
MY
PARENTS
FROM
THE
GREATER
HARTFORD
AREA
TO
THE
GREATER
CLEVELAND
OHIO
AREA
THIS
WAS
NOT
AN
ACTION
OF
MY
CHOICE
THE
ONLY
HOCKEY
COVERAGE
I
COULD
GET
THERE
REGULARLY
WAS
RED
WINGS
AND
PENGUINS
EXPLAINING
IN
PART
WHY
I
FOLLOW
THESE
TEAMS
TODAY
IN
CLEVELAND
YOU
COULDNT
EVEN
FIND
HOCKEY
SCORES
ON
THE
OCLOCK
NEWS
BECAUSE
THEY
FIGURED
THAT
IF
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
IT
IT
WASNT
A
SPORT
AT
LEAST
YOUR
PARENTS
DIDNT
MOVE
YOU
IDAHO
THE
ONLY
THINGS
THAT
GET
ANY
COVERAGE
THERE
ARE
FOOTBALL
BASKETBALL
AND
BASEBALL
PATTY
