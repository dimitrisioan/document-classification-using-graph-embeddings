the
hart
trophy
goes
to
the
player
most
valuable
to
his
team
not
to
the
best
player
in
the
league
so
your
above
arguement
is
really
worthless
personally
i
always
thought
that
most
valuable
to
his
team
was
silly
why
should
the
best
player
in
the
league
be
penalized
because
he
plays
on
a
team
with
other
good
players
why
should
a
lesser
player
be
picked
solely
because
hes
the
best
player
on
a
weak
team
wouldnt
the
weaker
team
be
helped
even
more
by
the
best
player
in
the
league
doesnt
the
presence
of
the
best
player
in
the
league
make
the
other
players
on
the
team
look
better
too
the
hart
trophy
was
orginally
awarded
in
a
time
where
people
did
not
think
in
terms
of
who
was
the
best
player
rather
in
terms
of
who
was
the
most
valuable
to
the
team
and
valuable
to
his
team
was
not
and
should
not
be
considered
synonymous
with
best
we
are
talking
about
a
time
when
honour
and
attitude
not
measurable
skills
were
the
most
important
assets
a
player
brought
to
his
team
his
league
and
his
sport
this
was
before
the
onslaught
of
professionalism
which
has
clearly
denigrated
what
was
formerly
the
foremost
peacetime
pursuit
of
glory
the
hart
trophy
is
not
a
prize
it
is
an
honour
cordially
as
always

so

and
so
