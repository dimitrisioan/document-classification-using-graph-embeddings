HOCKEY
COVERAGE
THIS
IS
A
GENERAL
QUESTION
FOR
US
READERS
HOW
EXTENSIVE
IS
THE
PLAYOFF
COVERAGE
DOWN
THERE
IN
CANADA
IT
IS
ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE
NOT
TO
WATCH
A
SERIES
ON
TV
IE
THE
ONLY
TWO
SERIES
I
HAVE
NOT
HAD
AN
OPPORTUNITY
TO
WATCH
THIS
YEAR
ARE
WASHNYI
AND
CHISTL
THE
LATTER
BECAUSE
IM
IN
THE
WRONG
TIME
ZONE
WE
IN
CANADA
ARE
BASICALLY
SWAMPED
WITH
COVERAGE
AND
I
WONDER
HOW
MANY
SERIESGAMES
ARE
TELEVISED
NATIONALLY
OR
EVEN
LOCALLY
IN
THE
US
AND
HOW
MUCH
PRECEDENCE
THEY
TAKE
OVER
SAY
LOCAL
NEWS
IF
THE
GAMES
GO
INTO
DOUBLEOT
EMAIL
ME
SO
AS
NOT
TO
WASTE
BANDWIDTH
PLEASE
MY
NEWS
FEED
IS
KIND
OF
SLOW
ANYWAYS
