this
years
biggest
and
worst
opinion
i
was
thinking
about
who
on
each
of
the
teams
were
the
mvps
biggest
surprises
and
biggest
disappointments
this
year
now
these
are
just
my
observations
and
are
admittedly
lacking
because
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
all
the
teams
the
same
amount
anyway
mvp
most
valuable
player
to
his
team
both
in
terms
of
points
and
in
terms
of
leadership
cant
win
without
him
biggest
surprise
the
player
who
rose
above
expectation
the
player
that
may
have
raised
the
level
of
his
game
to
a
new
height
even
if
that
new
level
doesnt
necessarily
warrant
an
allstar
berth
includes
those
players
who
at
the
outset
of
the
season
may
not
even
have
been
in
the
teams
plans
biggest
disappointment
the
player
from
whom
we
expected
more
eg
i
picked
denis
savard
in
montreal
because
with
the
new
emphasis
on
offence
brought
by
demers
shouldnt
savard
have
done
better
