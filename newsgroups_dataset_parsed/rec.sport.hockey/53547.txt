what
makes
you
think
so
id
like
to
understand
your
reasoning
from
my
seat
the
caps
dont
really
appear
to
believe
that
they
can
defeat
pittsburgh
therefore
they
dont
i
think
their
spirit
was
broken
in
last
years
playoffs
and
hasnt
really
recovered
i
dont
know
what
the
season
series
numbers
were
but
i
believe
that
the
pens
won
it
i
think
that
either
the
devils
or
the
islanders
will
cause
more
problems
for
what
is
this
spirit
crap
im
a
caps
fan
and
hope
they
win
if
they
end
up
facing
pittsburgh
but
i
dont
think
the
caps
lose
to
pitt
because
of
lack
of
spirit
yes
the
penguins
won
the
season
series
against
the
caps
theyve
won
eighteen
games
in
a
row
for
gods
sake
did
you
ever
think
the
penguins
might
be
good
and
thats
why
they
win
i
reread
what
i
wrote
and
it
didnt
say
exactly
what
i
thought
sure
the
pens
are
a
better
team
theyve
got
size
and
the
best
skill
players
in
the
league
theyve
also
got
the
best
clutch
goaltending
theyre
the
best
team
in
the
league
but
my
point
was
the
caps
have
not
played
to
their
ability
level
vs
the
pens
since
last
years
choke
and
thats
the
mental
problem
the
one
theyve
had
for
a
number
of
years
i
tried
to
point
out
spirit
mental
preparedness
will
to
win
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
its
missing
when
the
caps
play
the
pens
actually
youre
right
it
wont
make
any
difference
