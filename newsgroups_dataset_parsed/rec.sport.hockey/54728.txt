IN
GOLCHOWYALCHEMYCHEMUTORONTOCA
GERALD
OLCHOWY
WRITES
SO
WHATS
STOPPING
POCKLINGTON
FROM
GOING
TO
A
BANK
AND
BORROWING
MILLION
DOLLARS
TO
PAY
OFF
HIS
TREASURY
BRANCH
LOANSI
WAS
READING
ACCORDING
TO
THE
RECENT
TSN
REPORT
PETER
PUCK
IS
NOT
PAYING
ANY
INTEREST
ON
THE
TREASURY
BRANCH
LOANS
THATS
A
LOT
OF
GREEN
SOMEWHERE
THAN
POCKLINGTON
BUSINESS
HAVE
GROSS
REVENUES
OF
ABOUT
MILLION
PER
YEARI
DONT
THINK
HE
WOULD
HAVE
MUCH
PROBLEM
BORROWING
FROM
HIS
VISA
TO
PAY
OFF
HIS
MASTERCARD
IF
HE
WANTED
TO
AGAIN
ACCORDING
TO
TSN
VIRTUALLY
EVERYTHING
THAT
PETER
PUCK
HAS
ALREADY
HAS
LIENS
AGAINST
IT
OF
COURSE
WE
CANT
REALLY
BE
SURE
OF
THIS
POCKLINGTON
IS
AT
THE
POINT
OF
MAXIMUM
ADVANTAGE
RIGHT
NOWAND
HE
IS
BASICALLY
RIGHT
IN
THAT
NORTHLANDS
WHICH
IS
A
CREATURE
OF
THE
CITY
OF
EDMONTON
MUST
GIVE
HIM
A
BETTER
DEAL
IN
THE
ERA
OF
ESCALATING
SALARIES
NORTHLANDS
AND
THE
CITY
BENEFITTED
AS
MUCH
AS
HE
DID
DURING
THE
EIGHTIES
FROM
THE
OILERSAND
WEALTH
GENERATED
BY
THE
OILERS
SUCCESS
WAS
SHAREDBUT
THE
FINANICAL
VIABILITY
OF
SMALL
MARKET
TEAMS
HAS
RADICALLY
CHANGED
IN
THE
SPACE
OF
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AND
FOR
THE
OILERS
TO
REMAIN
VIABLE
AND
COMPETITIVE
THEY
NEED
MUCH
MORE
OF
THE
REVENUE
STREAM
FROM
CONCESSIONS
PARKING
AND
BUILDING
ADVERTISING
AS
MOST
EVERY
OTHER
PROFESSIONAL
SPORTS
FRANCHISE
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
HAS
WHAT
WAS
ONCE
A
FAIR
AGREEMENT
THAT
SHARED
THE
WEALTH
IS
NOW
NORTHLANDS
SUCKING
THE
BLOOD
OUT
OF
THE
OILERS
FRANCHISE
THE
OILER
RATIONALE
REGARDING
THE
RENEGOTIATION
OF
PLAYER
CONTRACTS
IS
THAT
A
DEAL
IS
A
DEAL
SATHER
HAS
SPOUTED
THIS
REPEATEDLY
POCKLINTON
HAS
A
CONTRACT
WITH
NORTHLANDS
UNTIL
A
DEAL
IS
A
DEAL
PERHAPS
IF
HE
INCLUDED
THE
INCOME
HE
HAS
RECEIVED
FROM
HIS
SALE
OF
ASSETS
PLAYERS
SUCH
AS
GRETZKY
AND
THE
INCOME
HE
HAS
RECEIVED
IN
EXPANSION
FEES
WITH
HIS
REVENUES
HE
WOULDNT
BE
LOSING
MONEY
HE
HAS
ADMITTED
PULLING
THIS
MONEY
OUT
OF
THE
OILER
FRANCHISE
TO
PUT
INTO
HIS
OTHER
BUSINESSES
THE
OILERS
HAVE
PAID
SEVERAL
TIMES
OVER
WHAT
THE
COLISEUM
COST
TO
BUILD
AND
BRING
EDMONTON
PRESTIGE
AND
RECOGNITION
THROUGHOUT
THE
WORLD
THAT
IS
ESSENTIALLY
PRICELESSTO
NICKELANDDIME
THE
OILERS
JUST
SO
NORTHLANDS
CAN
USE
REVENUE
SUCKED
OUT
OF
THE
OILERS
TO
SUBSIDIZE
THEIR
HORSERACING
OPERATIONS
IS
INSANITY
I
THINK
THAT
POCKLINGTON
HAS
RECEIVED
AMPLE
PROVINCIAL
SUBSIDIZATION
I
CANT
REALLY
BLAME
HIM
FOR
GOING
AFTER
MUNICIPAL
SUBSIDIZATION
BUT
HE
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
IT
POCKLINGTON
HAS
SUCKED
REVENUE
OUT
OF
THE
OILERS
IN
ORDER
TO
PROP
UP
HIS
FAILING
BUSINESS
INTERESTS
POCKLINGTON
IS
NOT
TO
BE
TRUSTED
I
DOUBT
VERY
MUCH
THAT
ANY
OILER
TEAM
WILL
EVER
AGAIN
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
UNDER
POCKLINGTONS
STEWARDSHIP
AS
SOON
AS
A
PLAYER
SHOWS
HIMSELF
TO
BE
A
COMPETENT
NHLER
AND
EXPECTS
TO
BE
PAID
ACCORDINGLY
HE
IS
SHIPPED
OFF
FOR
YOUNGER
PLAYERS
AND
OR
DRAFT
PICKS
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
SO
MANY
MORONS

AND
SO
LITTLE
