WRITES
OK
BUFFALO
FANS
I
AM
A
RED
WINGS
FAN
BUT
AM
AMAZED
AT
HOW
THE
SABRES
ARE
BEATING
UP
ON
THE
BRUINS
IS
THERE
ANY
REASON
FOR
THIS
IS
IT
GRANT
FUHR
OR
MOGILNY
AND
LAFONTAINE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
FROM
YOU
SINCE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
THE
SABRES
DAVE
VERGOLINI
MICHIGAN

UNIVERSITY

PURE
AND
SIMPLE
GRANT
FUHR
IS
MONEY
HE
HAS
BEEN
AWESOME
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
ESPECIALLY
LAST
NIGHT
BUT
MOGILNY
HAS
BEEN
SCORING
WELL
AND
HIS
RUSSIAN
FRIEND
KYMLEV
SP
HAS
ALSO
DONE
WELL
BUT
FUHR
IS
THE
BIGGEST
REASON
THEY
ARE
WINNING
AND
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THIS
YEARS
TEAM
AND
PREVIOUS
YEARS
