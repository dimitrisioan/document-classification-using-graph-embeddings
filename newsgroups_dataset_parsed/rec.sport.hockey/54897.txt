CANUCKS
OVER
WINNIPEG
THE
JETS
GAVE
THE
CANUCKS
ANOTHER
RUN
FOR
THEIR
MONEY
IN
AN
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
GAME
TO
THE
FIRST
OF
THE
SERIES
BUT
ONCE
AGAIN
CAME
UP
SHORT
AS
VANCOUVER
OUTSCORED
WINNIPEG
THE
PATTERN
OF
THE
FIRST
GAME
WAS
REPEATED
TONIGHT
WITH
THE
CANUCKS
SCORING
QUICKLY
AND
THEN
GOING
TO
SLEEP
IN
THE
SECOND
PERIOD
ONLY
TO
STAVE
OFF
A
JET
COMEBACK
WITH
OPPORTUNE
GOALS
FROM
THEIR
GREATER
TALENT
THE
JETS
LOOKED
MORE
DANGEROUS
IN
THIS
ONE
BUT
IT
DIDNT
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
NUMBERS
THAT
COUNTED
GOALS
VANCOUVERS
BIG
LINE
PRODUCED
AGAIN
WITH
CENTRE
CLIFF
RONNING
AND
LEFT
WINGER
GEOFF
COURTNALL
SCORING
IN
THE
FIRST
AND
IN
THE
SECOND
TO
BOOST
THE
CANUCKS
TO
A
LEAD
ON
GIVEAWAYS
BY
THE
SUSPECT
JET
DEFENCE
OF
BAUTIN
AND
ULANOV
MENTAL
LAPSES
BY
THE
DEFENCE
AND
GOALSCORING
TALENT
IN
OPPORTUNE
AREAS
MADE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
ALL
THREE
CANUCK
GOALS
HOWEVER
AS
IN
THE
FIRST
GAME
THE
JETS
WORKED
HARD
TO
TAKE
THE
GAME
TO
THE
CANUCKS
IN
THE
SECOND
PERIOD
THE
JETS
DOMINATED
THE
SECOND
CHECKING
HARD
AND
PENETRATING
THE
VANCOUVER
ZONE
WITHOUT
BEING
CHALLENGED
BY
A
CANUCK
TEAM
THAT
WANTED
TO
PACK
IT
IN
EARLY
THE
HARD
WORK
PAID
OFF
LATE
IN
THE
SECOND
WHEN
TIE
DOMI
CAUGHT
VANCOUVER
GOALIE
KIRK
MCLEAN
BY
SURPRISE
WITH
A
SHARP
ANGLE
SHOT
TO
MAKE
THE
SCORE
DOMIS
GOAL
GAVE
THE
JETS
NEW
LIFE
AS
THEY
BEGAN
TO
TAKE
THE
RUSH
TO
THE
CANUCKS
COLLAPSING
DEFENCE
THE
CANUCKS
WERE
UNWILLING
TO
DO
ANYTHING
BUT
LET
MCLEAN
TAKE
SHOTS
AND
CLEAR
THE
REBOUNDS
THE
JETS
WERE
ALLOWED
TO
SET
UP
AND
MAKE
PLAYS
BOTH
GOALIES
MADE
STANDUP
SAVES
AS
THE
PLAY
PICKED
UP
CONSIDERABLY
MCLEAN
MADE
THREE
GREAT
SAVES
IN
THE
SECOND
OFF
A
DANCING
TEAMMU
SELANNE
WHILE
ESSENSA
WAS
ROCKED
BY
A
PAVEL
BURE
DRIVE
SELANNE
LOOKED
DANGEROUS
ON
THE
RUSH
AS
THE
JETS
PRESSED
A
SERIES
OF
ATTACKS
INTO
THE
CANUCK
ZONE
THE
CANUCKS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
LOOKED
LIKE
THEY
WERE
OFFERING
FOUR
CHECKING
LINES
IN
AN
EFFORT
TO
PRESERVE
THEIR
SLIM
LEAD
A
SERIES
OF
MINOR
PENALTIES
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SECOND
PERIOD
RESULTED
IN
A
ONE
MAN
ADVANTAGE
FOR
THE
JETS
IN
THE
EARLY
THIRD
THE
JETS
TEMPO
NUMMINEN
DROVE
A
PUCK
FROM
THE
POINT
THROUGH
MCLEANS
LEGS
AND
INTO
THE
NET
TO
TIE
THE
GAME
AT
THE
CANUCKS
DISCORDANT
PLAY
PICKED
UP
WHERE
IT
LEFT
OFF
THIS
WAS
CHARACTERIZED
BY
LONG
LEAD
PASSES
THAT
EITHER
NEVER
CONNECTED
OR
WERE
PICKED
OFF
BY
THE
JETS
AND
INDIVIDUAL
RUSHES
INTO
A
TIGHT
WINNIPEG
DEFENCE
THAT
WERE
NEVER
SUPPORTED
HOWEVER
AS
IN
THE
FIRST
AND
SECOND
CANUCK
GOALS
A
JET
DEFENSIVE
LAPSE
RE
BONEHEAD
PLAY
STALLED
THE
WINNIPEG
COMEBACK
WITH
THE
FACEOFF
IN
THE
WINNIPEG
ZONE
PAVEL
BURE
WAS
LEFT
TO
STAND
IN
THE
CREASE
WITH
NO
JET
DEFENDER
ANYWHERE
NEAR
HIM
BURE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
INVISIBLE
IN
THE
GAME
UP
TO
THAT
POINT
TOOK
A
REBOUND
AND
MANAGED
TO
ROOF
IT
WITH
A
BACKHAND
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
WAS
OFF
BALANCE
BY
THEN
IT
WAS
TOO
LATE
FOR
THE
JETS
TO
COME
BACK
ESSENSA
MADE
IT
TO
THE
BENCH
WITH
ONE
MINUTE
TO
GO
BUT
THE
EXTRA
ATTACKER
DID
NOTHING
FOR
THEIR
ATTACK
CANUCKS
WINNIPEG
NEXT
GAME
IS
FRIDAY
