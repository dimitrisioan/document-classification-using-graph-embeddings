SHERRI
NICHOLS
WRITES
OF
COURSE
FERREIRA
HAD
ALSO
TRADED
A
NUMBER
OF
VETERANS
WITH
MARGINAL
CONTRIBUTIONS
BEFORE
HE
WAS
FIRED
SO
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
THAT
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DIFFERENT
BESIDES
THEY
WERE
MARGINAL
CONTRIBUTORS
LETS
ALSO
NOT
FORGET
THAT
FERREIRA
CAME
THIS
CLOSE
TO
TRADING
KELLY
KISIO
WHICH
IF
THE
RUMORS
IVE
HEARD
ARE
TRUE
WAS
OVER
THE
STRONG
OBJECTIONS
OF
OTHER
ASPECTS
OF
SHARK
MANAGEMENT
AND
PROBABLY
HAD
A
LOT
TO
DO
WITH
BOTH
HIS
OUSTER
AND
THE
THREEHEADED
CONSENSUS
ORIENTED
GM
IMAGINE
FOR
A
SECOND
WHERE
THE
SHARKS
WOULD
BE
TODAY
IF
THAT
FAX

HADNT
JAMMED
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IM
HARD
PRESSED
TO
THINK
OF
ANY
OTHER
REAL
MISTAKES
FEREIRRA
MADE
IMAGINE
INDEED
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
WE
HAVE
THE
BENEFIT
OF
HINDSIGHT
LETS
SAY
THAT
IN
THE
VIEW
OF
THE
SHARKS
UPPER
MANAGEMENT
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
TRADE
KISIO
WAS
A
MAJOR
FACTOR
IN
THE
DECISION
TO
FIRE
FEIRERRA
IM
INCLINED
TO
TAKE
EXACTLY
THE
OPPOSITE
VIEW
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
KEPT
HIMHES
OBVIOUSLY
THE
LUCKIEST
MAN
IN
HOCKEY

WHAT
SACRIFICE

MADE
