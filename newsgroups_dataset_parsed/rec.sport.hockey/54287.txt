and
all

writes
the
way
he
does
does
not
belong
in
the
nhl
there
have
been
cheap
shot
artists
through
the
history
of
the
game
but
a
lot
of
them
have
been
talanted
players
bobby
clarke
kenny
linsemen
pie
mckenzie
chris
chelios
etc
but
nobody
has
been
out
right
as
dirty
a
cheapshot
coward
as
ulf
violence
in
hockey
has
got
to
be
curbed
and
players
like
should
have
been
a
women
samuelson
dont
belong
when
players
like
ulf
whos
main
purpose
is
to
injure
the
better
players
in
the
league
is
allowed
to
continue
and
the
league
wont
stop
it
the
players
should
a
christian
pro
aluminum
stick
directed
at
his
ugly
head
should
do
the
trick
nicely
if
the
bruins
get
a
chance
to
meet
pittsburgh
in
the
near
future
you
can
bet
neely
will
have
his
day
the
sight
of
watching
ulf
turtle
up
like
the
coward
he
is
is
worth
almost
as
much
as
a
stanely
cup
this
wimp
of
a
player
almost
ruined
the
career
of
one
the
best
right
wingers
in
the
game
if
you
are
to
remove
ulf
samuelson
from
the
lineup
the
penguins
would
not
even
notice
hes
gone
hes
an
eyesore
on
the
game
of
hockey
rich
rich
pull
your
head
out
of
your
ass
joseph
stiehm
as
if
an
aluminum
stick
being
taken
to
ulfs
head
is
gonna
solve
the
problem
with
violence
in
the
sport
of
hockey
how
the
hell
can
you
say
the
guy
is
a
goon
and
justify
it
with
your
backassward
mentality
saying
that
hurting
a
player
will
solve
anyones
problems
is
asinine
new
rules
and
a
new
referee
system
need
to
be
instituted
right
now
too
many
of
the
real
goons
get
away
with
too
much
because
the
ref
is
watching
the
play
or
supposed
to
beive
seen
koharski
and
van
hellemond
to
name
a
few
with
their
heads
up
their
asses
on
a
few
calls
rather
than
keeping
an
eye
on
the
goofballs
behind
the
play
even
if
the
linesmen
were
able
to
call
all
penalties
it
would
be
an
improvement
