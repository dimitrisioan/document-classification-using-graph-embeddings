im
just
wondering
where
all
the
bruins
fans
are
i
mean
they
woofed
it
up
with
about
posts
during
the
regular
season
saying
that
their
fave
team
was
going
to
kick
everyones
in
the
playoffs
and
win
the
stanley
cup
while
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
a
little
ranting
and
raving
im
just
curious
why
all
the
boston
faithful
have
stopped
posting
i
mean
i
havent
even
see
just
one
little
boston
fan
post
cept
for
the
bruins
fans
that
arent
cocky
well
maybe
theyre
all
out
on
the
golf
course
or
something
but
i
dont
know
id
sure
like
to
see
where
all
those
bruins
fans
are
at
robbie
po
streakers
we
do
what
comes
naturally
patrick
division
semis
pgh
penguins
you
see
now
wait
for
the
penguins
devils
stanley
possibility
dont
you
see
a
penguins
lead
cup
champions
strong
resemblancedg
here
in
the
middle
of
connecticut
there
are
plenty
of
bruin
fans
many
who
have
let
me
know
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
the
rangers
choked
down
the
stretch
i
think
the
bruins
are
doing
the
same
exact
thing
the
rangers
did
theyre
playing
too
tight
whos
responsibility
is
it
to
check
mogilny
he
has
gotten
off
a
number
of
quality
shots
on
goal
of
which
there
are
many
rebounds
which
are
not
being
cleared
by
the
bs
defense
its
too
bad
the
bs
might
not
get
the
opportunity
to
play
pittsburgh
again
i
would
really
enjoy
seeing
ulfie
get
beat
up
by
neely
we
all
hate
ulfie
but
would
love
him
on
are
team
