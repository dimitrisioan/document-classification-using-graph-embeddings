wood
played
most
of
his
junior
career
in
seattle
he
was
one
of
the
leading
scorers
on
a
mediocre
team
when
he
was
traded
away
in
he
rarely
lost
a
fight
and
was
one
of
the
toughest
players
in
the
whl
wood
is
fairly
small
for
an
enforcertype
i
mean
fleury
does
a
pretty
good
job
and
isnt
that
large
but
dody
is
no
fleury
and
fleury
is
no
enforcer
an
agitator
for
sure
but
fleury
never
has
and
never
will
have
a
fight
which
seems
to
be
what
youre
saying
wood
is
the
closest
fleury
ever
came
to
fighting
was
a
game
two
years
ago
against
los
angeles
there
was
a
scrum
and
mcsorley
pinched
fleurys
head
under
his
arm
fleury
dropped
his
gloves
and
gave
mcsorley
a
weak
shot
to
the
side
of
the
head
mcsorely
knowing
a
good
thing
when
he
saw
one
popped
fleury
one
right
between
the
eyes
end
of
fight
fleury
got
ten
stitches
for
his
trouble
the
only
player
i
can
ever
see
theo
fighting
is
cliff
ronning
and
even
then
hed
be
giving
up
two
inches
and
pounds
