OILERS
RUMOUR
TEAM
MOVING
PRESS
CONFERENCE
NEXT
WEEK
I
HEARD
A
STORY
ON
THE
LOCAL
SPORTS
NEWS
BROADCAST
IN
EDMONTON
OILER
OWNER
PETER
POCKLINGTON
WILL
BE
HOLDING
A
PRESS
CONFERENCE
NEXT
WEEK
WHILE
THE
EXACT
DETAILS
ARE
NOT
KNOWN
IT
IS
BELIEVED
TO
CONCERN
THE
OILERS
FUTURE
RUMOUR
HAS
IT
THAT
POCKLINGTON
SIGNED
A
TENTATIVE
LEASE
ARRANGEMENT
WITH
COPPS
COLLESIUM
IN
HAMILTON
DURING
THE
PRESS
CONFERENCE
POCKLINGTON
MAY
ANNOUNCE
THE
DEAL
IT
IS
QUITE
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
DEAL
MAY
SIMPLY
BE
A
WAY
TO
FORCE
EDMONTON
NORTHLANDS
TO
RENEGOTIATE
THE
OILER
LEASE
ON
THE
STADIUM
NORTHLANDS
HAS
OFFERED
TO
BUY
THE
OILERS
FOR
MILLION
EARLIER
BUT
THE
OFFER
WAS
REJECTED
IMMEDIATELY
BY
POCKLINGTON
AS
FOR
ME
MY
OPINION
IS
DIVIDED
EDMONTON
HAS
BEEN
FAIRLY
SUPPORTIVE
OF
THE
OILERS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEYRE
A
SMALL
MARKET
TEAM
THEY
HAD
MANY
SELLOUTS
IN
THE
EVEN
WITH
THE
PROBLEMS
THAT
THE
TEAM
HAD
THIS
YEAR
THEY
STILL
BROUGHT
IN
MORE
FANS
THAN
MANY
TEAMS
IN
LARGER
CITIES
DID
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
THE
TEAM
DOES
MOVE
THERE
IS
NO
PLACE
MORE
DESERVING
THAN
HAMILTON
OF
COURSE
HOW
WOULD
THAT
AFFECT
THE
GRAND
REALIGNMENT
SCHEME
OF
BETTMAN
