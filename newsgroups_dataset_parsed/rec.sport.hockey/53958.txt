the
blues
led
by
the
best
goalie
in
the
nhl
this
season
curtis
joseph
shutout
the
hawks
the
blues
are
playing
like
they
did
in
clutch
n
grab
shoot
the
puck
out
its
incredibly
boring
to
watch
but
if
it
works
finally
a
non
blues
fan
agrees
that
joseph
is
a
great
goalie
i
think
he
should
win
the
vezina
this
year
or
at
least
share
it
with
barrasso
who
also
has
been
shadowed
by
marios
amazing
performance
i
too
think
that
joseph
has
had
a
great
year
and
should
be
considered
for
the
vezina
i
think
barrasso
and
joseph
should
be
the
two
strongest
candidates
this
year
i
dont
believe
all
of
the
hype
that
roy
belfour
and
now
potvin
receive
for
their
goaltending
i
do
think
that
they
are
great
in
the
nets
but
i
would
rather
have
curtis
tommy
or
fuhr
in
the
nets
during
this
years
playoffs
the
big
name
tenders
always
seem
to
have
a
strong
defense
in
front
of
them
and
the
goaltenders
get
the
most
credit
i
would
rather
face
shots
a
game
than
have
to
rely
on
joseph
saving
but
if
the
goalie
is
going
to
face
shots
i
would
rather
have
joseph
or
barrasso
facing
them
jay
ps
go
quebec
and
i
know
that
mclean
and
several
others
should
be
mentioned
as
candidates
for
this
years
vezina
but
i
am
partial
to
joseph
and
barrasso
this
season
