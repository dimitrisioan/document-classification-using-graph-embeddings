THE
BLUES
LED
BY
THE
BEST
GOALIE
IN
THE
NHL
THIS
SEASON
CURTIS
JOSEPH
SHUTOUT
THE
HAWKS
THE
BLUES
ARE
PLAYING
LIKE
THEY
DID
IN
CLUTCH
N
GRAB
SHOOT
THE
PUCK
OUT
ITS
INCREDIBLY
BORING
TO
WATCH
BUT
IF
IT
WORKS
FINALLY
A
NON
BLUES
FAN
AGREES
THAT
JOSEPH
IS
A
GREAT
GOALIE
I
THINK
HE
SHOULD
WIN
THE
VEZINA
THIS
YEAR
OR
AT
LEAST
SHARE
IT
WITH
BARRASSO
WHO
ALSO
HAS
BEEN
SHADOWED
BY
MARIOS
AMAZING
PERFORMANCE
I
TOO
THINK
THAT
JOSEPH
HAS
HAD
A
GREAT
YEAR
AND
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
FOR
THE
VEZINA
I
THINK
BARRASSO
AND
JOSEPH
SHOULD
BE
THE
TWO
STRONGEST
CANDIDATES
THIS
YEAR
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ALL
OF
THE
HYPE
THAT
ROY
BELFOUR
AND
NOW
POTVIN
RECEIVE
FOR
THEIR
GOALTENDING
I
DO
THINK
THAT
THEY
ARE
GREAT
IN
THE
NETS
BUT
I
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
CURTIS
TOMMY
OR
FUHR
IN
THE
NETS
DURING
THIS
YEARS
PLAYOFFS
THE
BIG
NAME
TENDERS
ALWAYS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
A
STRONG
DEFENSE
IN
FRONT
OF
THEM
AND
THE
GOALTENDERS
GET
THE
MOST
CREDIT
I
WOULD
RATHER
FACE
SHOTS
A
GAME
THAN
HAVE
TO
RELY
ON
JOSEPH
SAVING
BUT
IF
THE
GOALIE
IS
GOING
TO
FACE
SHOTS
I
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
JOSEPH
OR
BARRASSO
FACING
THEM
JAY
PS
GO
QUEBEC
AND
I
KNOW
THAT
MCLEAN
AND
SEVERAL
OTHERS
SHOULD
BE
MENTIONED
AS
CANDIDATES
FOR
THIS
YEARS
VEZINA
BUT
I
AM
PARTIAL
TO
JOSEPH
AND
BARRASSO
