HELLOFATIME
TO

DOWN
AFTER

SEEMED

HAVE
THE

IN

POWER
PLAY
PHILOSOPHY
CONTINUES
TO
BE
DUMPANDCHASE
WHICH
EXCEPT
FOR
BOARDAHOLICS
LIKE
FLATLEY
DOESNT
WORK
AGAINST
THE

I
HOPE
AL
REALIZES
THIS
THEY
HAVE
TOO
MANY
TALENTED
FINESSE
PLAYERS
SO
WHY
NOT
CARRY
THE
PUCK
IN
AND
SETUP
IF
LAST
NIGHTS
GAME
IS
ANY
OMEN
THE
ISLES
COULD
BE
ON
THEIR
WAY
TO
THAT
OLE
CHAMPIONSHIP
FORM
COMING
FROM
BEHIND
LATE
IN
A
GAME
MY
ADVICE
TO
THE
CAPS
IS
TO
POUNCE
ON
THOSE
HEALY
REBOUNDS
FLATLEY
SHOWED
ALOT
OF
HEART
BY
