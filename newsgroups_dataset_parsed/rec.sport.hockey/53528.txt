will
still

trophy
at
the
end

potvin
is
very
good
and
i
do
believe
that
he
will
be
a
star
but
i
want
to
see
him
perform
in
the
playoffs
under
pressure
you
dont
think
he
is
performing
under
pressure
now
the
major
differences
between
playoff
hockey
and
normal
hockey
is
play
ing
every
other
night
which
is
physically
exhausting
and
you
play
the
same
team
in
a
consecutive
string
of
games
is
this
what
you
mean
by
pressure
have
you
even
thought
about
what
you
mean
by
pressure
or
are
your
thoughts
like
most
of
the
rest
of
this
drivel
simply
halfbaked
this
was
for
anybody
who
would
like
to
check
he
went
on
in
another
article
to
say
paraphrased
playoff
hockey
is
just
an
expression
used
by
announcers
to
convince
simpleminded
folks
like
yourself
that
what
you
are
seeing
is
a
better
product
than
a
regularseason
game
now
however
in
article
roger
maynard
writes
with
a
win
over
a
tough
whaler
squad
the
leafs
showed
all
doubters
what
playoff
hockey
is
all
about
so
roger
what
exactly
is
playoff
hockey
all
about
or
is
it
a
convenient
phrase
to
use
in
certain
circumstances
only
you
see
when
you
spout
off
with
flame
bait
too
many
times
sooner
or
later
it
catches
up
with
you
