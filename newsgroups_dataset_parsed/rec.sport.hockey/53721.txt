opened
the
scoring
as
markus
naslund
made
a
drop
pass
at
the
finnish
blue
line
popovic
picked
it
up
and
advanced
towards
the
finnish
goal
and
shot
a
nice
hard
wrist
shot
in
ketterers
top
corner
ville
sirens
slap
shot
from
the
blue
line
on
power
play
made
it
and
juha
riihijarvi
scored
a
nice
goal
in
another
power
play
when
he
close
in
front
of
goal
put
the
puck
high
over
aslin
after
the
first
period
the
finns
started
the
second
period
with
really
good
pressure
korpisalo
made
it
with
another
goal
from
close
range
high
over
aslin
then
during
the
finnish
pressure
sweden
turned
the
game
around
in
mikael
renberg
worked
hard
behind
the
finnish
goal
and
passed
the
puck
to
jan
larsson
in
front
who
backhanded
the
puck
low
rundqvist
entered
the
finnish
zone
and
passed
to
ahlund
and
the
finnish
defense
let
ahlund
skate
in
and
take
a
shot
that
ketterer
dropped
into
the
goal
next
roger
hansson
behind
the
goal
sent
the
puck
back
to
the
blue
line
where
roger
akerstrom
took
a
slap
shot
and
ketterer
didnt
see
the
puck
since
there
was
traffic
in
front
third
period
started
with
a
nice
goal
by
stefan
the
shadow
nilsson
stefan
and
patrik
juhlin
entered
the
finnish
zone
patrik
passed
the
puck
back
to
stefan
who
alone
with
ketterer
made
no
mistake
then
keijo
sailynoja
show
started
he
reduce
and
equalized
the
lead
in
only
seconds
first
he
scored
the
goal
and
after
that
he
came
in
alone
with
aslin
but
was
tripped
by
aslin
to
get
a
penalty
shot
sailynoja
made
a
nice
penalty
shot
showed
forehand
and
put
in
with
a
low
backhand
shot
the
swedes
seemed
to
head
for
a
win
when
mikael
renberg
scored
the
goal
late
in
the
game
on
a
nice
power
play
combination
renberg
waited
in
the
slot
showed
that
he
wanted
the
puck
on
the
backhand
side
ahlund
passed
the
puck
and
renberg
took
a
turnaround
shot
low
in
ketterers
goals
far
side
but
jari
korpisalo
had
other
plans
as
he
only
seconds
later
scored
the
games
final
goal
to
make
it
korpisalo
took
a
slap
shot
from
a
narrow
angle
that
maybe
aslin
should
have
saved
all
in
all
a
decent
game
where
the
defense
wasnt
the
best
both
teams
juggled
around
the
lines
a
bit
in
the
second
and
third
period
to
try
no
combinations
renberg
and
rundqvist
plays
well
together
in
the
swedish
team
larsson
nilssonjuhlin
best
line
overall
again
it
seems
to
be
a
working
wc
line
stillman
good
on
defense
some
players
arent
good
enough
for
the
wc
though

roger
hansson
challe
berglund
kenny
jonsson
will
likely
have
to
leave
for
nhl
pros
twogoal
scorers
jari
korpisalo
and
keijo
sailynoja
played
well
in
the
finnish
team
markus
ketterer
didnt
have
a
very
good
game
weve
seen
him
a
lot
better
so
lindfors
is
probably
finlands
starting
goalie
in
the
wc
i
heard
that
esa
tikkanen
will
join
the
finnish
team
it
would
be
inter
resting
to
know
which
other
pros
coach
matikainen
counts
on
