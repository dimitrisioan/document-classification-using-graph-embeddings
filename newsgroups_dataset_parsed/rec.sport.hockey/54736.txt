i
agree
with
but
you
are
wrong
about
in
fact
the
only
point
where
the
hawks
in
any
way
matched
the
blues
was
when
they
quit
trying
to
outmuscle
and
instead
tried
to
outskate
the
blues
they
scored
and
took
the
lead
too
bad
it
was
game
and
they
then
took
some
stupid
penalties
when
the
hawks
skated
they
outskated
the
blues
and
took
control
