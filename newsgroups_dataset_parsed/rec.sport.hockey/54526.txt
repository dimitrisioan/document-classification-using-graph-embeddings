RE
AND
YOU
THINK
ESPN
SHAFTED
YOU
IN
ARTICLE
RRHAMMERVMCMPILSTUEDU
WRITES
LIKE
MANY
OTHERS
I
TOO
WAS
WATCHING
THE
CAPSISLES
GAME
WHEN
THE
WENT
TO
THE
BASEBALL
GAME
I
TOO
WAS
PISSED
HOW
COULD
THEY
INTERUPT
SUCH
AN
IMPORTANT
GAME
I
UNDERSTAND
ABOUT
CONTRACTS
BUT
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
A
CLAUSE
IN
THE
CONTRACT
CONCERNING
IMPORTANT
GAMES
ANYWAY
US
BLUES
AND
HAWKS
FANS
GOT
SHAFTED
WORSE
WHILE
EVERYONE
IN
THE
US
AND
WATCHED
THE
GAME
ON
ABC
HOWEVER
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
LIVE
IN
THE
CENTRAL
ILLINOIS
AREA
WERE
SUBJECTED
TO
WATCHING
THE
ARTHRITUS
TELETHON
THE
AREA
THAT
WAS
MOST
AFFECTED
BY
THE
TELECAST
DID
NOT
GET
TO
SEE
THE
GAME
EXCEPT
THROUGH
HAWK
VISION
THIS
GAME
HAD
IT
BEEN
TELEVISED
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
FIRST
HOME
HAWKS
GAME
SHOWN
IN
THE
AREA
SINCE
THIS
TELEVISION
BULL
HAS
GOT
TO
STOP
WE
ARE
NOT
ONLY
BEING
DEPRIVED
OF
SEEING
GAMES
DUE
TO
SKYROCKETING
TICKET
PRICES
BUT
WE
ARE
ALSO
BEING
DEPRIVED
OF
WATCHING
THEM
ON
TV
PEACE
HAMMER
IM
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
TELETHON
SITUATION
AN
INDIVIDUAL
ON
COMPUSERVE
WAS
ALSO
VICTIMIZED
AND
WAS
EQUALLY
PISSED
THAT
WAS
A
LOCAL
TELEVISION
STATION
CONTRACT
WHICH
COULD
NOT
BE
BROKEN
FOR
THAT
ITEM
I
STRONGLY
SUGGEST
YOU
CALL
THAT
AFFILIATE
AND
VENT
YOUR
ANGER
ON
THEM
SUPPOSEDLY
ONE
STATION
HAD
TOLD
MY
FRIEND
THAT
THEY
HAVE
RECEIVED
HUNDREDS
OF
ANGRY
CALLS
WHICH
WILL
TRANSLATE
INTO
FAR
LESS
INCENTIVE
TO
PREEMPT
HOCKEY
TELECASTS
IN
FUTURE
THE
CONTRACT
WAS
WRITTEN
WHEN
THE
PATHETIC
WLAF
WAS
