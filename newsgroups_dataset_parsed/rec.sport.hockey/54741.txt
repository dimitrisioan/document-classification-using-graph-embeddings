HI
GUYS
WHAT
HAPPENED
POTVIN
DIDNT
LET
SIX
GOALS
BY
WENDEL
AND
ANDREYCHUK
WOKE
UP
HOME
ICE
AND
LOTS
OF
YELLING
IN
THE
GARDENS
GAVE
THE
LEAFS
THE
EMOTIONAL
EDGE
REFS
CALLS
ESPECIALLY
LAST
NIGHT
TENDED
TO
FAVOUR
LEAFS
A
COUPLE
OF
COMMENTS
ON
GILMOUR
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
GUY
ISNT
ONE
OF
THE
THREE
STARS
DOESNT
MEAN
HE
WAS
NOT
LEADING
THE
TEAM
SOMEONE
POSTED
THE
PLAYOFF
POINT
TOTAL
AND
HES
IN
SOMETHING
LIKE
FIFTH
OR
SIXTH
PLACEPLUS
HE
WALKED
AWAY
WITH
THE
MOLSON
CUP
GIVEN
FOR
ACCUMULATING
POINTS
FROM
THE
THREE
STAR
SELECTION
DURING
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
ON
THE
OFFICIATING
IVE
HEARD
GRIPES
FROM
BOTH
ENDS
ON
THIS
ONE
EMOTIONS
ARE
VERY
HIGH
IN
THIS
SERIES
THE
RIVALRY
IS
ONE
OF
THE
STRONGER
ONES
I
KNOW
OF
I
DO
HAVE
TO
AGREE
THAT
THE
OFFICIATING
LAST
NIGHT
WAS
PROLEAF
IN
GENERAL
EXCEPT
FOR
WHOEVER
MISSED
THAT
SLASH
ON
GILMOURS
HAND
IN
GENERAL
I
STILL
THINK
DETROIT
HAS
ONE
OF
THE
BETTER
CHANCES
VS
PITTSBURGH
THOUGH
I
THINK
THE
LEAFS
WOULD
DO
BETTER
AGAINST
THE
BLUESBUT
NOT
AS
WELL
IF
THEY
MADE
IT
OUT
OF
THE
DIVISION
PROBLEM
IS
I
LIKE
BOTH
THESE
TEAMS
THOUGH
IM
SUPPORTING
THE
LEAFS
ON
THE
UNDERDOG
PRINCIPLE
D
BY
THE
WAYGILMOUR
TIRING
OUT
IS
A
LOT
LIKE
BOB
PROBERT
NOT
PLAYING
AGGRESSIVE
HOCKEY
BY
THE
WAYIM
NOT
ANY
SORT
OF
EXPERT
NOR
DO
I
CLAIM
TO
BE
I
JUST
LIKE
WATCHING
A
GOOD
MATCHUP
