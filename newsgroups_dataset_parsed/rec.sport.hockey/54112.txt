what
a
man
just
some
thoughts
i
dont
usually
like
to
post
simply
to
make
fun
of
a
player
but
this
time
i
couldnt
resist
during
the
pensdevils
game
last
night
second
period
i
think
kevin
stevens
was
in
the
penalty
box
nicholls
punched
kjell
samuellson
in
the
face
then
raised
his
stick
like
a
two
handed
sword
to
defend
himself
all
kjell
could
do
at
and
pounds
was
laugh
and
speaking
of
swedish
penguins
defensemen
ulf
is
getting
a
little
out
of
hand
lately
his
cheap
shots
are
getting
more
frequent
and
more
violent
as
everybody
in
the
meadowlands
except
for
the
officials
could
see
last
night
he
rammed
the
butt
of
his
stick
down
one
of
the
devils
throat
ive
always
supported
the
argument
he
does
his
job
by
being
irritating
but
hes
starting
to
push
it
over
the
edge
imho
of
course
holiks
chop
to
barrassos
neck
wasnt
too
sportsmanlike
either
it
seems
that
he
was
following
the
the
only
way
to
beat
the
penguins
is
to
injure
them
philosophy
as
my
modern
drama
professor
pointed
out
to
me
the
other
day
jagr
was
stoned
pretty
well
tuesday
night
and
last
night
as
well
although
the
seconds
he
danced
around
the
devils
end
was
pretty
exciting
