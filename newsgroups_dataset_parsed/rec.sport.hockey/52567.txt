posting
from

but
i
think
the
reason
is
lemieux
had
a
point
season
and
was
the
first
nongretzky
to
win
the
hart
and
ross
since
people
turned
out
to
watch
him
play
i
will
grant
that
a
star
like
mario
will
draw
fans
even
if
the
team
sucks
but
this
is
short
term
only
i
still
do
not
think
the
attendance
increase
will
last
unless
the
team
is
a
winningcompetitiveimprovingbuttkicking
one
pittsburgh
was
still
getting
better
so
people
continued
to
support
them
if
they
suddenly
dropped
to
say
points
youd
have
knee
surgery
for
some
of
the
people
jumping
off
the
bandwagon
i
disagree
mcnall
has
demonstrated
with
gretzky
that
a
star
brings
out
the
crowds
whether
or
not
the
team
is
expected
to
do
well
very
few
fans
real
istically
expect
the
kings
to
do
well
this
year
although
i
do
and
yet
they
still
go
out
to
see
gretzky
this
is
the
marketing
strategy
selling
the
game
by
selling
the
stars
that
is
employed
by
baseball
and
notably
the
nba
and
this
is
the
attitude
that
the
new
bettmanmcnall
leadership
is
bringing
to
the
league
they
have
gone
on
record
as
stating
that
they
are
trying
to
sell
the
game
on
its
stars
timo
salami
and
brett
hull
are
perfect
examples
of
players
that
real
fans
know
arent
worth
a
damn
and
yet
being
benificiaries
of
marketingoriented
coaching
strategies
have
goal
totals
that
would
indicate
to
the
casual
observer
the
very
fans
the
nhl
wants
to
attract
that
these
players
are
indeed
superstars
they
made
the
transaction
to
try
and
build
a
winner
around
mario
that
is
true
but
the
improvement
in
attendance
came
before
they
started
doing
this
coffey
late
in
and
before
they
even
had
a
playoff
bound
team
a
doubling
of
attendance
occured
in
from
the
previous
year
an
increase
from
points
to
points
is
not
going
to
do
that
the
arrival
of
mario
lemieux
is
what
did
it
it
might
help
to
think
about
what
would
go
through
a
fans
mind
who
suddenly
found
an
interest
in
mario
and
the
pens
was
it
gee
mario
lemieux
is
amazing
ill
go
watch
him
play
or
was
it
gee
now
weve
got
a
kick
ass
guy
on
our
side
ill
go
watch
him
play
i
think
it
was
the
latter
it
aint
nearly
so
simple
as
this
the
casual
fan
doesnt
think
about
much
at
all
can
you
actually
find
an
adult
with
a
digit
iq
who
believes
that
mcdonalds
makes
good
hamburgers
i
did
provide
the
example
of
rocket
ismail
and
the
toronto
argonauts
of
the
cfldid
you
leave
it
out
because
you
dont
know
much
about
the
cfl
if
thats
the
case
then
fair
enough
but
if
it
isnt
the
case
then
im
curious
to
hear
your
explanation
yes
but
apparently
the
rocket
has
not
lived
up
to
his
marketing
responsi
bilities
has
he
he
was
hyped
initially
as
a
superstar
but
outside
of
one
grey
cup
game
he
has
done
very
little
to
maintainenhance
that
assess
ment
of
his
talents
most
argo
fans
probably
feel
the
team
would
be
better
off
without
him
cordially
as
always
