i
think
ill
let
everyone
make
there
own
comment
on
this
one
the
bad
alexei
kovalev
what
did
the
rangers
think
when
they
signed
him
did
they
think
he
was
another
domi
just
let
him
play
and
not
on
a
line
better
that
he
stays
in
the
minors
and
gets
icetime
all
the
time
whose
bad
it
has
been
neilson
and
smiths
decision
to
play
him
there
if
thats
what
you
mean
then
thats
bad
but
kovalev
himself
is
a
very
good
player
youre
right
if
he
werent
stranded
on
the
fourth
line
maybe
hed
produce
sound
familiar
darren
turcotte
neilson
and
smith
are
bad
kovalev
is
magical
lets
go
pens

owl
