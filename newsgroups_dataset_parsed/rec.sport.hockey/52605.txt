heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
i
just
dont
want
them
on
mine
ah
so
now
were
into
european
player
bashing
what
next
no
more
french
canadiens
yeah
theres
an
idea
let
them
french
speaking
canadiens
have
their
own
hockey
league
we
dont
want
them
are
you
crazy
the
nhl
is
one
of
the
true
international
leagues
and
yes
there
are
many
europeans
who
deserve
to
play
in
the
nhl
and
are
better
than
some
north
americans
look
at
teemu
i
for
one
am
glad
to
see
europeans
in
the
nhl
and
i
hope
the
nhl
soon
expands
to
europe
its
nice
to
see
all
these
different
people
come
together
to
form
the
soon
to
be
hockey
teams
