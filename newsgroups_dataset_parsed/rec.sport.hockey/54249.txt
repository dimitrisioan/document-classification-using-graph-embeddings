HALFWAY
THROUGH

A
POSSIBILITY
EITHER

THE
UNDERDOGS
ST
LOUIS
AND
BUFFALO
IS
SO
REWARDING
MONTREAL
IS
AT
THIS
STAGE
IN
A
TEAMS
LIFE
WHERE
THEY
ARE
NOT
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
GO
ALL
THE
WAY
YET
TOO
GOOD
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
SOME
REALLY
GOOD
DRAFT
PICKS
IS
IT
JUST
ME
OR
DOES
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
ALSO
THINK
THAT
THIS
YEAR
THE
CUP
FINAL
SHOULD
BE
PLAYED
BETWEEN
TEAMS
FROM
THE
WALES
IS
IT
JUST
BECAUSE
THEYRE
PLAYING
MONTREAL
THAT
I
FIND
THE
DIQUES
ARROGANT

GETTING
SICK
