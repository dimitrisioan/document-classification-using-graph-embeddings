HOMERED
THE
WINGS
IN
ARTICLE
ANDYBGSUEDU
RYAN
WRITES
ROGER
MAYNARD
WROTE
ONCE
AGAIN
THE
LEAFS
OVERCAME
THE
RED
WINGS
IN
WHAT
WAS
POSSIBLY
THE
MOST
EXCITING
GAME
PLAYED
YET
IN
THIS
PLAYOFF
YEAR
PERHAPS
IT
WAS
THE
MOST
EXCITING
GAME
PLAYED
YET
THAT
YOU
HAVE
SEEN
FOR
MOST
OF
US
WHO
WATCH
TEAMS
AROUND
THE
LEAGUE
WITH
INTEREST
AND
OBJECTIVITY
IT
WAS
NOWHERE
NEAR
THE
MOST
EXCITING
GAME
PAUL
STEWART
CALLED
THE
SINGLE
WORST
GAME
IVE
SEEN
THIS
YEAR
FEDEROVS
MAJOR
WAS
OBVIOUS
AND
I
DONT
DISPUTE
IT
HOWEVER
CHAISSONS
PENALTY
SHOULDNT
EVEN
HAVE
BEEN
A
PENALTY
LET
ALONE
A
MAJOR
AND
A
GAME
MISCONDUCT
THE
GAME
MISC
CALL
IS
FOR
HIGH
STICKING
ONLY
THERE
IS
NO
BLOOD
PENALTY
JUST
BECAUSE
CHAISSON
BARELY
TOUCHED
THE
POOR
SAP
AND
HE
HIT
THE
DASHER
AND
BLED
PROFUSELY
DOESNT
MEAN
IT
IS
A
PENALTY
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
INSTANT
REPLAY
IS
NOT
USED
ON
HITS
AT
FIRST
I
IMMEDIATELY
THOUGHT
AND
A
GAME
BECAUSE
THE
HIT
LOOKED
MUCH
MORE
SEVERE
FROM
AN
INTENTTOINJURE
PERSPECTIVE
THAN
IT
WAS
AFTER
SEEING
THE
REPLAY
ID
SAY
IT
DESERVED
MINUTES
FOR
BOARDING
IT
WAS
CARELESS
ANY
WAY
YOU
SLICE
IT
IF
STEWART
HAD
REPLAY
I
DO
NOT
THINK
CHAISSON
WOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
AND
THE
GAME
IN
THE
SECOND
PERIOD
BEHIND
POTVIN
PROBERT
HAD
THE
PUCK
AND
WAS
GOING
TO
GET
OUT
FRONT
AND
WAS
TACKLED
I
COULDNT
BELIEVE
THE
NOCALL
THIS
NOCALL
WAS
BULLSHIT
I
AGREE
I
ADMIRE
STEWART
FOR
LETTING
THEM
GO
BUT
PROBERT
LOOKED
UP
SAYING
WHERE
THE
HELL
IS
THE
PENALTY
IVE
NEVER
SEEN
PROBERT
WHINE
EITHER
HE
DOESNT
NEED
TO
NOW
IF
PROBIE
DECIDES
TO
PUT
WENDEL
THROUGH
THE
BOARDS
HES
PROBABLY
GONE
RIGHT
I
DONT
REMEMBER
WHO
ON
THE
LEAFS
TOUCHED
THE
PUCK
ON
RACINES
SHOT
TOWARDS
THE
END
OF
THE
GAME
SECONDS
LEFT
BUT
STEWART
CALLED
IT
OUT
OF
PLAY
LAST
TOUCHED
BY
DETROIT
EVERYBODY
IN
THE
GARDEN
INCLUDING
THE
LINESMEN
KNEW
IT
YZERMAN
PROTESTED
BUT
STEWART
JUST
LAUGHED
AND
REALLY
HOMERED
THE
WINGS
THIS
WAS
ALSO
BULLSHIT
BUT
ONCE
AGAIN
NO
REPLAY
IT
WAS
ROUSE
BTW
IM
REALLY
PISSED
THAT
THE
LINESMEN
DIDNT
CORRECT
THE
CALL
EITHERITS
BS
WHEN
THE
OFFICIALS
REFUSE
TO
ADMIT
THEY
MADE
A
MISTAKE
BUT
WHEN
IT
ALL
COMES
DOWN
TO
IT
WINGS
PLAYED
LIKE
SHIT
YES
THE
CALLS
YOU
DESCRIBE
SHOULD
NOT
HAVE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
A
DETROIT
LOSS
I
PICKED
THE
LEAFS
TO
WIN
GAME
ON
EMOTION
AND
ADRENALIN
BUT
THE
WINGS
HAVE
NO
EXCUSES
FOR
GAME
THEY
SHOULD
BE
THE
SUPERIOR
TEAM
THE
CALL
THAT
PISSED
ME
OFF
THE
MOST
WAS
ANDERSON
GETTING
FOR
PUTTING
HIS
STICK
IN
SOMEBODYS
EYE
THAT
WAS
THE
MOST
DANGEROUS
STICK
INFRACTION
I
HAVE
SEEN
IN
A
LONG
TIME
AND
EVERYBODY
IN
THE
DAMN
LEAGUE
KNOWS
HES
AN
ASSHOLE
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
STICKWORK
FOUR
LOUSY
MINUTES
BULLSHIT
CALL
MURRAY
SHOULD
SEND
THE
TAPE
IN
OR
A
WING
SHOULD
HAMMER
THE
LIVING
SHIT
OUT
OF
HIM
