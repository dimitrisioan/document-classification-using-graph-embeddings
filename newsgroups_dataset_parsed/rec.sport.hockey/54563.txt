MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
SUGGESTED
THAT
FUHRS
PLAY
IS
THE
ONLY
REASON
THAT
THE
SABRES
BEAT
THE
BRUINS
WHILE
FUHR
WAS
A
CRITICAL
FACTOR
I
WOULD
NOT
OVERLOOK
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
SABRES
FINALLY
GOT
SOME
SCORING
FROM
PEOPLE
OTHER
THAN
MOGILNY
AND
LAFONTAINE
KHMYLEV
SWEENEY
HAWERCHUCK
ETC
INDEED
LAFONTAINE
PLAYED
HURT
AND
DIDNT
SCORE
MANY
GOALS
ALSO
THE
TEAM
PLAYED
BETTER
DEFENSE
ALTHOUGH
NOT
GREAT
THAN
IN
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
FUHR
DESERVES
A
LOT
OF
CREDIT
BUT
NOT
ALL
OF
IT
ROBERT
A
I
AGREE
WITH
THIS
I
ALSO
THINK
FUHRS
CONTRIBUTION
FOR
SABRESS
WIN
IS
JUST
THE
SAME
AS
MANY
PALYERS
IN
THE
TEAM
MOGILNY
HAD
SIX
GOALS
IN
FOUR
GAMES
INCLUDING
TWO
GOALS
FOR
THE
GREAT
COMEBACK
IN
THE
FINAL
WIN
AFTER
FUHR
HAD
LEFT
THE
KEY
FOR
SABRESS
WIN
OVER
BOSTON
IS
WHOLE
TEAMS
STRONG
COMMITMENT
AS
AN
UNDERDOG
AND
ALL
THEIR
TALENT
PLAYERS
INCLUDING
MOGILNY
AND
FUHR
I
THINK
THAT
GRANT
FUHR
DESERVES
MORE
CREDIT
THAN
THAT
WHILE
ITS
TRUE
THAT
THE
ENTIRE
SABRES
TEAM
PLAYED
VERY
WELL
I
STILL
BELIEVE
THAT
IF
IT
WASNT
FOR
GRANT
FUHR
THE
SERIES
WOULD
NOW
BE
TIED
HE
VIRTUALLY
STOLE
GAMES
AND
FOR
THE
SABRES
IN
BOTH
OF
THESE
GAMES
FUHR
STOOD
ON
HIS
HEAD
TO
GIVE
THE
SABRES
THE
CHANCE
TO
WIN
ESPECIALLY
IN
GAME
FUHR
MADE
A
SERIES
OF
HUGE
STOPS
IN
THE
THIRD
PERIOD
WHEN
THE
SCORE
WAS
TIED
EVEN
IN
GAME
WHEN
THE
SABRES
WON
THE
SCORE
SEEMED
TO
INDICATE
THAT
THE
SABRES
DOMINATED
HOWEVER
IF
IT
HADNT
BEEN
FOR
FUHR
THE
SABRES
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
UP
I
THINK
IT
WAS
THROUGH
THE
PERIOD
AND
THE
BRUINS
WOULDNT
HAVE
HAD
TO
OPEN
UP
THE
GAME
THEREBY
ALLOWING
MOGILNY
TO
SCORE
THE
THIRD
GOAL
ON
A
BREAKAWAY
TO
SALT
AWAY
THE
GAME
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
IN
MY
MIND
THAT
FUHR
WAS
THE
CRITICAL
FACTOR
IN
THE
VICTORY
IN
MY
OPINION
NEELY
OATES
AND
JUNEAU
PLAYED
AS
WELL
AS
LAFONTAINE
MOGILNY
AND
HAWERCHUK
THE
SABRES
DID
GET
EXTRAORDINARY
EFFORTS
FROM
HANNAN
SWEENEY
WOOD
AND
KHMYLEV
COMPARED
TO
THAT
OF
THE
BRUINS
CHECKERS
HOWEVER
THE
BRUINS
DEFENSE
IMO
PLAYED
BETTER
THAN
THE
SABRES
DEFENSE
THE
SABRES
HAVE
KEN
SUTTON
PLAYING
A
REGULAR
SHIFT
AFTERALL
THE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
SERIES
WAS
FUHR
