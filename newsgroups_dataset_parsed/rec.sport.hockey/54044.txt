BOWMAN

GENIUSJOHNSON
ISNT
BOWMAN
IS
A
GREAT
COACHJOHNSON
A
VERY
GOOD
ONE
HOWEVER
BOWMAN
IS
REALLY
NOT
A
MODERN
COACH
AND
PATRICKS
SOLUTION
OF
HAVING
HIM
ONLY
RUN
THE
TEAM
ON
GAME
DAYS
AND
DELEGATE
MOST
OF
THE
DAYTODAY
RESPONSIBITY
TO
THE
ASSISTANTS
IS
A
SHREWD
MANAGERIAL
DECISION
ON
PATRICKS
PART
IMHO
BOWMAN
IS
THE
PERFECT
COACH
FOR
THIS
GROUP
OF
PLAYERS
AT
THIS
TIME
JOHNSON
WAS
THE
PERFECT
COACH
TWO
YEARS
AGO
FOR
HIS
GROUP
OF
PLAYERS
I
WOULD
SAY
WE
HAVE
BEEN
VERY
LUCKY
HERE
IN
PITTSBURGH
THAT
THE
ORDER
THESE
COACHES
CAME
IN
WAS
THIS
ONE
EXCLUDING
THE
UNFORTUNATE
CIRCUMSTANCES
WHICH
BROUGHT
ABOUT
THE
CHANGE
WITH
THE
IMMENSE
TALENT
ON
THE
PENGUINS
ROSTER
THIS
YEAR
A
TOUGHER
BOWMAN
KEEPS
THE
EGOS
IN
CHECK
JOHNSON
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WAS
ABLE
TO
INSPIRE
THE
YOUNGER
INEXPERIENCED
PLAYERS
TO
NEW
HEIGHTS
BOTH
COACHES
HAVE
HAD
DIFFERENT
STRENGTHS
BOTH
OF
WHICH
CAME
AT
EXACTLY
THE
RIGHT
TIME
ANOTHER
PERSON
ALSO
MENTIONED
THAT
BOWMAN
IS
THE
PERFECT
COACH
FOR
THIS
TIME
SINCE
NOBODY
CAN
ARGUE
WITH
HIS
DECISIONS
HOW
CAN
YOU
ARGUE
WITH
THE
COACH
WITH
THE
BEST
RECORD
IN
HOCKEY
ANYWAY
PLAYING
FOR
A
GREAT
COACH
LIKE
THAT
DEMANDS
RESPECT
WHICH
ALSO
KEEPS
THE
EGOS
IN
CHECK
