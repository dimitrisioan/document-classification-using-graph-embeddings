observations
on
the
lindros
trade
like
ottawa
would
be
stupid
enough
to
get
lindros
why
do
you
think
quebec
traded
him
lindros
would
go
on
personal
strike
againmaybe
i
should
talk
to
ottawa
mgmt
about
arranging
such
a
trade
on
that
xenophobe
thankfully
nobody
agreed
with
him
publicly
maybe
we
should
look
at
baseball
the
supposed
american
pasttime
sp
look
at
all
the
damn
latin
americans
playing
there
they
should
all
be
deported
they
arent
american
add
sarcasm
to
taste
to
roger
wow
for
once
we
agree
i
hope
this
isnt
a
sign
of
things
to
come
ill
become
a
ranting
lunatic
who
talks
about
nothing
but
the
leafs
being
the
best
in
the
campbell
on
the
rangers
i
told
someone
that
nothing
that
happened
in
the
patrick
would
surprise
me
anymore
i
lied
how
the
hell
can
a
team
go
into
washington
earn
a
shutout
then
come
back
home
and
lose
to
pitiful
hartford
the
absolute
pinnacle
of
mediocrity
i
cant
stand
it
from
what
ive
read
the
goalie
is
to
blame
this
time
as
beezer
played
pretty
poorly
smith
is
talking
about
calling
up
corey
hirsch
from
binghamton
everybody
is
pointing
fingers
this
is
definitely
not
the
same
team
which
wanted
to
prove
itself
in
washington
now
nothing
that
happens
in
the
patrick
will
surprise
me
yeah
right
keith
keller
lets
go
rangers
lets
go
