AM
EDT
THE
PRESIDENT
GOOD
MORNING
LADIES
AND
GENTLEMEN
ITS
AN
HONOR
FOR
ME
TO
WELCOME
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
MAINE
BLACK
BEARS
THE
WINNER
OF
THE
NCAA
DIVISION
I
HOCKEY
NATIONAL
CHAMPIONSHIP
TO
THE
ROSE
GARDEN
AND
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
I
UNDERSTAND
FROM
SENATOR
MITCHELL
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
TEAM
FROM
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
MAINE
EVERY
TO
WIN
A
NATIONAL
CHAMPIONSHIP
AND
WERE
GLAD
TO
HAVE
THEM
HERE
IM
INSPIRED
NOT
ONLY
BY
HOW
THE
TEAM
PULLED
TOGETHER
TO
WIN
THE
CHAMPIONSHIP
BUT
HOW
THE
ENTIRE
STATE
PULLED
TOGETHER
TO
CHEER
THEM
ONTO
VICTORY
COMING
FROM
A
STATE
THAT
IS
ALSO
RELATIVELY
SMALL
IN
SIZE
BUT
ALSO
FILLED
WITH
PRIDE
AND
TRADITION
AND
COMMUNITY
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
HOW
THE
PEOPLE
OF
MAINE
MUST
FEEL
ABOUT
THE
BLACK
BEARS
IN
OUR
STATE
PEOPLE
ARE
STILL
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
TIME
WE
WON
THE
ORANGE
BOWL
OVER
THE
NUMBER
ONE
RANKED
FOOTBALL
TEAM
AND
THAT
WAS
BACK
IN
IM
SURE
THAT
YEARS
FROM
NOW
THE
PEOPLE
OF
MAINE
WILL
AS
PROUD
OF
THIS
TEAM
AS
THEY
ARE
TODAY
YOU
KNOW
IN
MY
STATE
FOOTBALL
IS
A
SLIGHTLY
MORE
POPULAR
SPORT
THAN
HOCKEY
WE
DONT
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
ICE
LAUGHTER
BUT
AFTER
SPENDING
THREE
MONTHS
GETTING
BANGED
AROUND
IN
THIS
TOWN
I
CAN
UNDERSTAND
A
LITTLE
MORE
ABOUT
HOCKEY
THAN
I
DID
BEFORE
I
CAME
HERE
HOCKEY
IS
A
TOUGH
GAME
ITS
A
HARDHITTING
SPORT
IT
DOES
HAVE
ONE
VIRTUE
THOUGH
THERES
A
PENALTY
FOR
DELAY
OF
GAME
I
WISH
WE
HAD
THAT
RULE
IN
THE
SENATE
LAUGHTER
IN
GOVERNMENT
AS
IN
HOCKEY
LEADERSHIP
IS
IMPORTANT
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
SENATE
OUR
TEAM
HAS
A
GREAT
CAPTAIN
THE
MAJORITY
LEADER
AND
THE
SENIOR
SENATOR
FROM
MAINE
GEORGE
MITCHELL
JUNIOR
SENATOR
COHEN
LOOKS
SO
YOUNG
I
CANT
IMAGINE
LAUGHTER
IM
ACTUALLY
BITTER
ABOUT
SENATOR
COHEN
BECAUSE
HE
LOOKS
SO
MUCH
YOUNGER
THAN
ME
ON
YOUR
HOCKEY
TEAM
THE
CAPTAIN
JIM
MONTGOMERY
HAS
DONE
A
GREAT
JOB
HE
SCORED
THE
WINNING
GOAL
LATE
IN
THE
CHAMPIONSHIP
GAME
LEADING
YOU
TO
A
COMEFROMBEHIND
VICTORY
SOMETHING
ELSE
I
KNOW
A
LITTLE
BIT
ABOUT
SPORT
BRINGS
OUT
THE
BEST
IN
INDIVIDUALS
AND
IN
TEAMS
AND
IN
COMMUNITIES
I
SHARE
THE
PRIDE
THAT
SENATOR
MITCHELL
AND
SENATOR
COHEN
AND
CONGRESSMAN
ANDREWS
AND
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
OF
MAINE
MUST
FEEL
FOR
THE
BLACK
BEARS
WHO
HAVE
SHOWN
US
ALL
HOW
TO
PLAY
AS
A
TEAM
HOW
TO
BRING
OUT
THE
BEST
IN
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
HOW
TO
COME
FROM
BEHIND
I
THINK
ITS
IMPORTANT
AS
I
ASK
YOUNG
PEOPLE
FROM
AROUND
AMERICA
WHO
HAVE
ACHIEVED
OUTSTANDING
THINGS
IN
WORKING
TOGETHER
TO
COME
HERE
TO
THE
WHITE
HOUSE
TO
BE
RECOGNIZED
AND
APPRECIATED
BY
THEIR
COUNTRY
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
THOSE
KINDS
OF
VALUES
AND
THOSE
KINDS
OF
VIRTUES
NEED
TO
BE
INGRAINED
IN
ALL
OF
US
FOR
ALL
OF
OUR
LIVES
WE
NOW
HAVE
ANOTHER
ROLE
MODEL
AND
IM
GLAD
TO
HAVE
THEM
HERE
TODAY

GREAT
APPLAUSE
Q
MR
PRESIDENT
DID
YOU
AUTHORIZE
THE
MOVE
ON
WACO
THIS
MORNING
SIR
THE
PRESIDENT
I
WAS
AWARE
OF
IT
I
THINK
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
MADE
THE
DECISION
AND
I
THINK
I
SHOULD
REFER
ALL
QUESTIONS
TO
HER
AND
TO
THE
FBI
Q
DID
YOU
HAVE
ANY
INSTRUCTIONS
FOR
HER
AS
TO
HOW
IT
SHOULD
BE
EXECUTED
THE
PRESIDENT
NO
THEY
MADE
THE
TACTICAL
DECISIONS
THAT
WAS
THEIR
JUDGMENT
THE
FBI
Q
IS
THIS
A
RAID
THE
PRESIDENT
AND
I
WILL
I
WANT
TO
REFER
YOU
TO
TALK
TO
THE
ATTORNEY
GENERAL
AND
THE
FBI
I
KNEW
IT
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
DONE
BUT
THE
DECISIONS
WERE
ENTIRELY
THEIRS
ALL
THE
TACTICAL
DECISIONS
Q
WHAT
DID
YOU
AND
SENATOR
MITCHELL
TALK
ABOUT
THIS
MORNING
Q
ANY
CHANCE
FOR
THAT
STIMULUS
PACKAGE
THE
PRESIDENT
SENATOR
MITCHELL
OUGHT
TO
PAY
MY
QUARTER
LAUGHTER
I
WAS
IN
THERE
LAUGHTER
SENATOR
MITCHELL
YOU
HAVE
TO
PAY
THAT
QUARTER
THE
PRESIDENT
I
WAS
READY
LAUGHTER
SENATOR
MITCHELL
HES
WORTH
A
QUARTER
ANY
DAY
Q
ANY
CHANCE
FOR
YOUR
BILL
SIR
THE
PRESIDENT
WE
TALKED
ABOUT
WHAT
WAS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
THIS
WEEK
IN
THE
SENATE
AND
ABOUT
WHAT
OTHER
MEETINGS
WERE
GOING
TO
HAVE
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
WEEK
WE
ONLY
HAD
ABOUT
FIVE
MINUTES
TO
TALK
AND
WE
AGREED
WED
GET
BACK
TOGETHER
LATER
AROUND
NOON
AND
TALK
SOME
MORE
Q
SENATOR
DOLE
SAID
OVER
THE
WEEKEND
THAT
YOUR
COMPROMISE
IS
NO
COMPROMISE
THE
PRESIDENT
WELL
I
KNOW
HE
DID
BUT
LOOK
SENATOR
DOLE
AND
A
LOT
OF
THE
OTHER
REPUBLICANS
NOW
IN
THE
SENATE
VOTED
FOR
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
THING
FOR
RONALD
REAGAN
IN
AND
OUR
RESEARCH
INDICATES
THAT
A
MAJORITY
OF
THEM
OVER
TIME
VOTED
FOR
A
TOTAL
OF
EMERGENCY
SPENDING
MEASURES
TOTALLING
OVER
BILLION
WHEN
REAGAN
AND
BUSH
WERE
PRESIDENT
IN
THOSE
ADMINISTRATIONS
AND
MANY
OF
THOSE
PURPOSES
WERE
NOT
NEARLY
AS
WORTHY
AS
PUTTING
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
BACK
TO
WORK
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GO
BACK
AND
REVISIT
EVERY
ONE
BUT
YOU
CAN
DO
IT
YOU
CAN
LOOK
AT
THE
RESEARCH
THERE
SO
THIS
POSITION
THEYRE
TAKING
IS
NOT
CREDIBLE
WE
HAVE
A
VERY
TOUGH
FIVEYEAR
DEFICIT
REDUCTION
PLAN
ALL
THESE
COSTS
ARE
COVERED
DURING
THAT
TIME
AND
THEN
SOME
AND
THE
VERY
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
SAYING
THIS
HAS
ALL
GOT
TO
BE
PAID
FOR
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
OF
A
HISTORY
ON
WHICH
TO
BASE
THEIR
POSITION
THEYVE
GOT
YEARS
OF
VOTE
FOR
STIMULUS
MEASURES
OF
THIS
KIND
THAT
HAD
VERY
LITTLE
TO
WITH
PUTTING
THE
AMERICAN
PEOPLE
BACK
TO
WORK
SO
I
THINK
WEVE
GOT
A
CHANCE
TO
WORK
IT
OUT
AND
IM
HOPEFUL
WELL
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
TODAY
AND
TOMORROW
IM
FEELING
PRETTY
GOOD
ABOUT
IT
THE
PRESS
THANK
YOU
