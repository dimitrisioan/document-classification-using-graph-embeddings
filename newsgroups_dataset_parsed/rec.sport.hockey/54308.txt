wood
played
most
of
his
junior
career
in
seattle
he
was
one
of
the
leading
scorers
on
a
mediocre
team
when
he
was
traded
away
in
he
rarely
lost
a
fight
and
was
one
of
the
toughest
players
in
the
whl
wood
is
fairly
small
for
an
enforcertype
i
mean
fleury
does
a
pretty
good
job
and
isnt
that
large
but
dody
is
no
fleury
having
been
witness
to
three
or
four
of
his
fights
closeup
he
simply
isnt
ready
to
fight
at
an
nhl
level
assuming
that
its
his
role
which
is
all
he
really
showed
us
in
his
few
games
up
from
kc
if
he
can
pass
shoot
or
skate
i
never
saw
much
of
it
all
he
has
is
a
right
fist
which
isnt
bad
but
at
the
nhl
level
the
other
players
are
smart
enough
to
grab
the
thing
before
he
can
land
anything
significant
once
you
control
that
hand
hes
a
fish
flopping
on
the
beach
and
the
other
player
can
do
just
about
anything
he
wants
to
him
his
entire
strategy
seemed
to
be
keep
the
hand
out
of
reach
until
he
found
an
opening
and
i
never
once
saw
him
find
an
opening
worth
talking
about
he
got
neutralized
quickly
and
stomped
on
a
couple
of
times
unless
he
shows
some
new
tricks
in
camp
hell
be
on
my
career
minor
leaguer
list
since
this
was
his
first
taste
of
the
nhl
i
expect
the
sharks
gave
it
to
him
so
hed
know
what
hed
have
to
work
on
offseason
he
needs
to
get
stronger
he
needs
to
get
more
speed
and
he
needs
to
show
some
versatility
as
something
else
than
a
simply
goond
because
he
wasnt
particularly
good
as
a
goon
