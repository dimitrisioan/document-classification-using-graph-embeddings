WRITES
WALES
CONFERENCE
ADAMS
DIVISION
SEMIFINAL
BOSTON
VS
BUFFALO
THE
BRUINS
ARE
PLAYING
SOME
EXCELLENT
HOCKEY
AND
WITH
CAM
NEELY
BACK
AND
MOOG
HIS
OLD
SELF
AGAIN
THIS
SHOULD
BE
A
CAKEWALK
BRUINS
IN
IM
HOPING
FOR
A
FUHR
MIRACLE
BUT
I
AGREE
THAT
BOSTON
WILL
LIKELY
WIN
THE
SERIES
GOALTENDING
IS
ABOUT
EQUAL
TOP
OFFENSIVE
PLAYERS
ARE
ABOUT
EQUAL
MOGILNYLAFONTAINE
VS
OATESJUNEAU
BUT
BUFFALO
HAS
NO
ANSWER
TO
NEELY
NOT
TO
IMPLY
THAT
NEELY
IS
NOT
A
TOP
OFFENSIVE
PLAYER
BTW
IN
FACT
HES
ONE
OF
MY
FAVOURITES
EVEN
THOUGH
HES
A
DAMN
BRUIN
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
MATCHUP
WRT
LINEUP
FAVOURS
BOSTON
ANYWAY
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WILL
GO
SIX
QUEBEC
VS
MONTREAL
THIS
ONE
IS
VERY
TOUGH
TO
CALL
MONTREAL
CERTAINLY
HAS
THE
EXPERIENCE
FACTOR
BUT
QUEBEC
IS
MORE
TALENTED
IMHO
ITLL
COME
DOWN
TO
THE
GOALIES
ILL
GO
WITH
EXPERIENCE
AND
ROY
CANADIENS
IN
AGREED
HEREBUT
MONTREAL
WILL
BE
PUSHED
TO
THE
LIMIT
IS
IT
JUST
ME
OR
DOES
EVERYTHING
MONTREAL
DOES
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
COME
DOWN
TO
ROY
GO
HABS
FINAL
BOSTON
VS
MONTREAL
WILL
BRUIN
DOMINATION
CONTINUE
IN
THIS
RIVALRY
YES
MOOG
HAS
CONSISTENTLY
OUTPERFORMED
ROY
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
AFTER
STUFF
BRUINS
IN
FIVE
I
CANT
PREDICT
A
MONTREAL
VICTORY
BECAUSE
IVE
BEEN
WATCHING
THEM
PLAY
FOR
WEEKS
AND
IMO
THEY
SEVERLY
NEED
SOME
TOUGHER
PLAYERS
ESPECIALLY
TO
PLAY
IN
THE
GARDEN
LAST
TIME
THEY
BEAT
THE
BS
BUT
BOSTON
HAD
A
CLEAR
TERRITORIAL
ADVANTAGE
THE
VICTORY
WAS
ROYS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
CANT
BRING
MYSELF
TO
PREDICT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
A
LOSS
SO
ILL
JUST
SAY
I
WILL
NOT
BE
PUTTING
MONEY
ON
THIS
SERIES
PATRICK
DIVISION
SEMIFINAL
PITTSBURGH
VS
NY
ISLANDERS
WHAT
CAN
I
SAY
THE
PENS
ARE
FLYING
HIGH
AND
HAVE
THE
MOST
TALENT
IN
THE
LEAGUE
AGREED
NY
DOESNT
HAVE
THE
GOALTENDING
TO
STOP
THE
ONSLAUGHT
INDEPENDENT
OF
THE
TROUBLE
THEY
HAVE
GIVEN
PITTSBURGH
THIS
YEAR
PENS
IN
FIVE
WHICH
IS
CREDIT
TO
NY
WASHINGTON
VS
NEW
JERSEY
CAPITALS
IN
AGREED
HERE
TOO
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WILL
GO
AT
LEAST
SIX
JERSEY
HAS
A
DECENT
TEAM
AND
WASHINGTON
HAS
DONE
POORLY
AGAINST
THE
DIVISION
THIS
YEAR
PITTSBURGH
VS
WASHINGTON
IF
THE
CAPS
HAD
BILL
RANFORD
I
MIGHT
SEE
AN
UPSET
BUT
DON
BEAUPRE
JUST
DOESNT
INSPIRE
MY
HOPES
PENGUINS
IN
I
THINK
THEY
WILL
USE
TABARACCI
MORE
AFTER
BEAUPRE
GETS
SHELLED
I
DONT
THINK
IT
WILL
GO
SIX
EITHERMAYBE
FIVE
CONFERENCE
FINAL
PITTSBURGH
VS
BOSTON
A
REPLAY
OF
LAST
YEAR
THE
PENGUINS
ARE
JUST
AS
GOOD
AS
MONTHS
AGO
AND
THE
BRUINS
ARE
MUCH
IMPROVED
BUT
PENGUINS
IN
IF
PITTSBURGH
PLAYS
BOSTON
IMO
THEY
WIN
IN
LIKELY
FIVE
POSSIBLY
SIX
THEY
OWN
THE
BRUINS
IF
THEY
PLAY
MONTREAL
I
THINK
IT
WILL
GO
TO
SEVEN
AND
ONCE
AGAIN
I
WONT
BE
PUTTING
MONEY
ON
THE
SEVENTH
GAME
I
SAY
SEVEN
BECAUSE
THE
HABS
HAVE
PLAYED
PITTSBURGH
VERY
TOUGH
THIS
SEASON
CAMPBELL
CONFERENCE
NORRIS
DIVISION
SEMIFINAL
CHICAGO
VS
ST
LOUIS
OR
MINNESOTA
BLACKHAWKS
IN
CHICAGO
WILL
WIN
BUT
I
THINK
IN
AT
LEAST
SIX
CHICAGO
IS
NOT
THAT
GOOD
IMO
AND
REMEMBER
THAT
THEY
TAKE
RIDICULOUS
NUMBERS
OF
PENALTIES
DETROIT
VS
TORONTO
THE
LEAFS
HAVE
HAD
AN
EXCELLENT
SEASON
BUT
THEYVE
BEEN
PLAYING
PLAYOFF
HOCKEY
ALL
YEAR
THE
HABS
UNDER
BURNS
WERE
THE
SAME
WAY
AND
ALWAYS
WILTED
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
RED
WINGS
IN
VERY
TRUE
THE
LEAFS
HAVE
MUCH
TO
BE
PROUD
OF
BUT
THEY
WILL
SOON
FIND
OUT
WHY
MONTREAL
DID
SO
LOUSY
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
TORONTO
MIGHT
WIN
TWO
OR
THREE
AT
MLG
THOUGH
WINGS
IN
SIX
MAYBE
EVEN
SEVEN
FINAL
CHICAGO
VS
DETROIT
THIS
WILL
BE
A
WAR
FEDOROV
WILL
WIN
IT
IN
OT
RED
WINGS
IN
IT
WILL
BE
A
WARPOSSIBLY
THE
MOST
INTENSE
PLAYOFF
SERIES
OF
THEM
ALL
AND
YES
I
THINK
DETROIT
WILL
WIN
PROBERT
WILL
HAVE
TO
COME
UP
BIG
THOUGH
SMYTHE
DIVISION
SEMIFINALS
VANCOUVER
VS
WINNIPEG
CANUCKS
IN
OUR
FIRST
DISAGREEMENT
CANUCKS
ARE
PLAYING
LIKE
SHIT
THEY
DONT
USE
THEIR
SIZE
AT
ALL
WHICH
MAY
EXPLAIN
WHY
THEY
GET
HAMMERED
BY
A
TEAM
CHASING
THEM
CALGARYWINNIPEG
IN
SIX
CALGARY
VS
LOS
ANGELES
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
TOUGH
TO
CALL
EXCEPT
FOR
THREE
THINGS
THE
KINGS
DONT
HAVE
A
GOALIE
GARY
ROBERTS
WILL
BE
BACK
THE
KINGS
SHOT
THEMSELVES
IN
THE
FOOT
BY
TRADING
A
PROVEN
WINNER
PAUL
COFFEY
FOR
A
PROVEN
LOSER
JIMMY
CARSON
GRETZKY
IS
JUST
TOO
WEARY
TO
CARRY
THIS
GROUP
FLAMES
IN
THIS
IS
ALSO
TOUGH
FOR
ME
TO
CALL
BECAUSE
I
HAVENT
SEEN
THE
SMYTHE
ENOUGH
I
DONT
THINK
ROBERTS
WILL
BE
WELL
ENOUGH
TO
FIGURE
IN
COFFEY
IS
A
NONISSUE
WHO
CARES
WHAT
CARSON
HAS
DONE
BEFORE
AND
NEVER
UNDERESTIMATE
GRETZKY
LA
IN
SIX
FINAL
VANCOUVER
VS
CALGARY
FLAMES
IN
IF
IT
IS
THESE
TWO
CALGARY
WILL
NOT
NEED
SIX
GAMES
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WILL
BE
LAWINNIPEG
ANYWAY
AND
LA
IN
SEVEN
BECAUSE
OF
HOME
ICE
COFERENCE
FINAL
DETROIT
VS
CALGARY
RED
WINGS
IN
WOW
MUSTVE
BEEN
TOUGH
TO
GO
AGAINST
YOUR
TEAM
BUT
LETS
SEE
I
PICKED
LADETROIT
DETROIT
WILL
WIN
PROBABLY
IN
SIX
STANLEY
CUP
FINAL
PITTSBURGH
VS
DETROIT
THREE
IN
A
ROW
AND
OFFICIAL
DYNASTY
STATUS
FOR
THE
PENS
OR
CAN
THE
WINGS
COMPLETE
A
DREAM
SEASON
WELL
THE
WINGS
ARE
BETTER
IN
GOAL
NOT
SUFFICIENTLY
SO
THOUGH
IMHO
AND
HAVE
BETTER
DMEN
HOWEVER
MARIO
AND
THE
BOYS
CAN
SURE
SCORE
LOOK
FOR
JAGR
TO
SHINE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
THOUGH
I
SURE
WOULD
LOVE
TO
SEE
PROBERT
BEAT
SOME
SENSE
INTO
HIM
THE
PENS
ARE
JUST
TOO
MUCH
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
DETROIT
WILL
HAVE
A
TOUGHER
BATTLE
TO
GET
HERE
PENGUINS
IN
IF
PITTSBURGH
PLAYS
DETROIT
IT
WILL
GO
LONGER
THAN
FIVE
AND
I
WOULDNT
BET
AGAINST
THE
WINGS
THEY
ARE
VERY
STRONG
IMO
AND
NOBODY
KNOWS
HOW
STRONG
BECAUSE
THEYVE
BEEN
UNDERACHIEVING
MOST
OF
THE
YEAR
IF
FORCED
TO
CHOOSE
THOUGH
ID
HAVE
TO
TAKE
THE
PENGUINS
A
SIDE
NOTE
VLAD
LAST
WEEK
YOU
SAID
THAT
SELANNE
WAS
A
BETTER
PLAYER
THAN
GILMOUR
NO
WAY
HE
IS
A
MORE
TALENTED
PURE
GOAL
SCORERBUT
ASIDE
FROM
THE
AGE
DIFFERENCE
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
I
WOULD
TAKE
HIM
OVER
GILMOUR
ON
MY
TEAM
IM
NOT
ASKING
FOR
FLAMES
EITHER
BTWIVE
SPENT
MORE
THAN
ENOUGH
TIME
ARGUING
ON
BEHALF
OF
SELANNE
AND
I
STILL
SAY
HES
A
GREAT
PLAYER
BUT
WHILE
HE
AND
GILMOUR
ARE
BOTH
DANGEROUS
OFFENSIVELY
GIVE
TEEMU
AN
EDGE
GILMOUR
DOES
IT
ALL
I
KNOW
A
LOT
OF
GILMOURBASHING
GOES
ON
ESP
FROM
FLAME
FANS
BUT
IMO
YOU
GUYS
ARE
LETTING
YOUR
DISLIKE
OF
GILMOUR
CLOUD
YOUR
JUDGEMENT
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
HIS
SKILL
HE
IS
EASILY
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
ALLROUND
PLAYERS
IN
THE
NHL
