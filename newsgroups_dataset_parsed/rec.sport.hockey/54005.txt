saw
the
slash

the
goaltender
who
had
his
jugular
vein
cut
by
a
skate

think
he
was
a
sabre
but
im
not
positive

name

has
happened
to
him
since

player
whose
skate
cut

goalie

this
ever
happened
before
in

hockey
game

go
pens
that
would
be
clint
malarchuck
it
was
speculated
at
the
time
that
the
injury
was
so
serious
that
had
he
been
playing
at
the
other
end
of
the
rink
at
the
time
he
was
playing
in
the
same
end
as
the
ambulence
is
parked
he
never
would
have
survived
ditto
if
he
were
playing
anything
other
than
a
league
with
an
ambulance
on
standby
if
youve
seen
video
tape
of
the
incident
it
is
amazing
how
much
blood
there
was
it
was
literally
spurting
out
all
over
the
ice
as
clint
grabbed
his
neck
and
watched
the
puddle
in
horror
amazingly
enough
he
made
a
full
recovery
and
played
again
in
the
nhl
he
was
getting
on
in
years
at
the
time
of
the
incident
anyway
and
didnt
play
for
too
long
afterward
some
people
speculated
that
he
just
couldnt
get
himself
back
together
after
the
incident
and
i
think
he
had
a
bunch
of
other
personal
problems
dogging
him
afterward
he
did
eventually
get
back
to
form
and
played
another
year
or
so
after
that
and
then
i
believe
he
retired
anyone
else
