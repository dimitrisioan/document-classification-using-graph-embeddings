RE
BUFFALO
SABRES
QUOTING
BILL
GREGORY
TO
ALL
BG
HEY
I
SAW
THAT
GAME
I
THOUGHT
THE
SABRES
LOOKED
BETTER
THAT
YOU
BG
DESCRIBED
ITS
BOSTON
THAT
LOOKED
WEAK
AND
UNSURE
OF
THEMSELVES
EVEN
BG
IF
BIG
IF
THEY
BRUINS
WIN
THE
THIRD
GAME
WHATS
THAT
GOING
TO
BG
PROVE
THEY
BE
LUCKY
WELL
NOW
THE
SABRES
ARE
UP
IN
GAMES
AND
ITS
TO
BAD
THAT
BOSTON
ISNT
PUTTING
UP
MORE
OF
A
FIGHT
AS
THAT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
BEST
SERIES
OF
THE
PLAYOFFS
I
THINK
BOSTON
WILL
COME
OUT
SMOKING
IN
THE
NEXT
TWO
GAMES
AND
THAT
BUFFALO
WILL
END
THE
SERIES
IN
GAME
SIX
BACK
IN
BUFFALO
AND
SAY
HOW
ABOUT
THOSE
ISLANDERS
THEY
ARE
UP
ON
THE
CAPITALS
AND
WILL
PROBABLY
WIN
THE
SERIES
ONLY
TO
BE
CLOBBERED
BY
THE
PENGUINS
WHO
SHOULD
ELIMINATE
THE
DEVILS
IN
THE
NEXT
GAME
I
CANNOT
SEE
IM
SAD
TO
SAY
ANYONE
BEATING
THE
PENGUINS
THIS
YEAR
AGAIN
AND
THEY
WILL
TAKE
CUP
IM
AFRAID
WELL
TALK
TO
YA
LATER
STEVE
TO
FIND
OUT
A
GIRLS
FAULTS
PRAISE
HER
TO
HER
GIRL
FRIENDS
