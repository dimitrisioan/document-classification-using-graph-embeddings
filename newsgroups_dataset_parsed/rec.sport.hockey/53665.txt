ROBERT
TOLD
ME
THEIR
FORWARDS
WERE
ALL
CANADIANGERMANS
PERHAPS
SOMEBODY
CAN
SORT
THIS
OUT
FOR
US
MY
POSSIBLENHLEUROPEAN
LEAGUESITE
LIST
SWITZERLAND
BERNE
ZURICH
LUGANO
AND
OTHERS
OK
THIS
AINT
NORTH
AMERICA
AND
SO
ON
BUT
I
STILL
DOUBT
THAT
ANY
CITY
HAVING
A
POP
OF
AND
BELOW
COULD
SUPPORT
AN
NHL
TEAM
OF
COURSE
SWITZERLAND
PROBABLY
SHOULD
BE
JUDGED
AS
ONE
LARGE
CITY
BECAUSE
OF
SMALL
DISTANCES
BETWEEN
CITIES
BUT
STILL
GERMANY
DUSSELDORF
COLOGNE
BERLIN
MUNICH
MANNHEIM
ROSENHEIM
DUSSELDORF
YES
ALTHOUGH
THE
ARENA
IS
AN
ANACHRONISM
AN
OPEN
WALL
BEHIND
ONE
OF
THE
GOALS
ESSENTIALLY
AN
OUTDOOR
ARENA
COLOGNES
ARENA
ONLY
SEATS
ABOUT
BERLIN
IS
ABOUT
AND
NO
NEW
FACILITY
WILL
BE
BUILT
UNLESS
THEIR
OLYMPIC
BID
IS
SUCCESSFUL
MUNICH
DOES
HAVE
AN
ARENA
SWEDEN
STOCKHOLM
GOTHENBURG
MALMO
GAVLE
MALMO
IS
BIG
ENOUGH
BUT
THEY
ALSO
NEED
A
NEW
ARENATHE
CURRENT
ONE
HAS
SEATS
I
THINK
FINLAND
HELSINKI
TURKU
TAMPERE
IF
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
NHL
EVEN
HELSINKI
WOULD
STRUGGLE
TO
MAKE
IT
WORK
TURKU
DESPITE
AN
EXCELLENT
ARENA
AND
TAMPERE
ARE
NOWHERE
NEAR
BIG
ENOUGH
FOR
MAJOR
LEAGUE
HOCKEY
ITALY
MILAN
ROME
AND
THE
SOUTH
ARE
OUT
OF
THE
QUESTION
THIS
COULD
AS
WELL
BE
AFRICA
TO
HOCKEY
FANS
ROMANS
WERE
GIVEN
THE
CHANCE
TO
HOST
SOME
GAMES
BUT
SHOWED
NO
INTEREST
WHATSOEVER
ALL
TEAMS
IN
THE
ITALIAN
LEAGUE
COME
FROM
MILAN
AND
THE
SMALLER
CITIES
IN
THE
NORTH
FRANCE
PARIS
CHAMONIX
RUOEN
PARIS
HAD
THEIR
OWN

FRANCAISSP
PRO
TEAM
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AGO
I
BELIEVE
THEY
EVEN
MADE
IT
TO
THE
EUROPEAN
CLUB
CHAMPIONSHIP
FINALS
TOURNAMENT
ONE
YEAR
BUT
EVENTUALLY
FOLDED
DUE
TO
LOWERTHANHOPEDFOR
ATTENDANCES
THE
REMAINING

TO

THE

CITIES
LACK
THE
MONEY

INFRASTRUCTURE
TO

HOCKEY
GREAT
BRITAIN
PERHAPS
MOST
EUROPEAN
TEAMS
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE

LONDON

BEEN

SHEFFIELD
AND
BIRMINGHAM
ALSO
HAVE
LARGE

AND
A

MIGHT
BE
BUILT
IN
