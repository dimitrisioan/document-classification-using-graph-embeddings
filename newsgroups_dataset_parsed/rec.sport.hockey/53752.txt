the
san
francisco
bay
area
media
is
reporting
tonight
that
the
detroit
red
wings
beat
the
toronto
maple
leafs
can
someone
who
is
not
part
of
the
media
conspiracy
against
the
leafs
tell
me
how
the
game
really
went
i
am
expecting
a
win
for
the
leafs
shutout
for
potvin
hat
trick
for
andreychuk
and
a
goal
and
assists
for
gilmour
if
the
leafs
really
lost
how
many
penalties
did
whichever
biased
ref
was
at
the
game
have
to
call
against
the
leafs
to
let
the
red
wings
win

sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
the
red
wings
earned
the
victoryeasily
i
watched
most
of
the
game
on
espn
as
soon
as
i
realized
that
they
were
televising
the
game
which
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
the
maple
leafs
were
flat
very
flat
meanwhile
the
red
wings
were
skating
very
freely
and
dictating
the
pace
of
the
game
i
didnt
detect
any
bad
penalty
calls
van
hellemond
did
his
usual
good
job
toronto
looked
like
how
i
expected
them
to
for
their
first
playoff
game
in
a
few
years
nervous
for
the
leafs
sake
i
hope
they
can
rid
themselves
of
the
butterflies
for
game
if
game
is
indicative
of
the
series
its
gonna
go
quick
