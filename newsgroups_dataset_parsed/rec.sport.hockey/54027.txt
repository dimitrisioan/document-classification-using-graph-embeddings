would
you
really
rather
have
those
two
instead
of
johan
by
your
logic
then
you
enjoy
having
falloon
and
ozolinsh
on
injured
reserve
falloon
was
hurt
on
a
clean
check
he
just
fell
poorly
same
with
wilson
i
dont
know
about
ozolinsh
a
judo
coach
would
do
more
for
the
sharks
injury
situation
than
bob
probert
actually
a
judojujitsu
coach
could
help
add
a
really
interesting
wrinkle
to
anyones
game
