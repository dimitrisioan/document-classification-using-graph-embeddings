FINLANDNORWAY
IN
WC
FINNS
HAD
TO
DO
THEIR
BEST
LAST
NIGHT
WHEN
THEY
PLAYED
AGAINST
NORWAY
IN
WORLD
CHAMPS
AFTER
TWO
PERIODS
THE
SCORE
WAS
STILL
THIS
GAME
WAS
QUITE
MUCH
SIMILAR
TO
THE
FIRST
GAME
FINLAND
PLAYED
AGAINST
FRANCE
THE
NORWEGIAN
GOALIE
WAS
VERY
GOOD
AND
A
BIT
LUCKY
TOO
IN
THE
THIRD
PERIOD
JUHA
RIIHIJRVI
SCORED
FROM
A
REBOUND
THE
TIME
WAS
AROUND
MINS
OR
SO
THE
SECOND
GOAL
WAS
SCORED
BY
KARI
HARILA
WHO
SHOT
STRAIGHT
FROM
A
FACEOFF
BEHIND
THE
NOWWEGIAN
GOALIE
SAKU
KOIVU
THE
CENTER
GOT
HIS
FIRST
POINT
OF
THIS
TOURNAMENT
SAKU
KOIVU
PLAYED
VERY
WELL
THROUGOUT
THE
GAME
AND
HE
WAS
AWARDED
THE
BEST
PLAYER
OF
THE
GAME
PRIZE
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
IS
QUITE
SMALL
IN
SIZE
HE
HANDLES
THE
PUCK
VERY
WELL
AND
IS
A
FAST
SKATER
I
THINK
THAT
WE
WILL
HEAR
FROM
THIS
GUY
IN
THE
FUTURE
