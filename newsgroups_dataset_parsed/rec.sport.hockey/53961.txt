tom
barrasso
wore
a
great
mask
one
time
last
season
he
unveiled
it
at
a
game
in
boston
it
was
all
black
with
pgh
city
scenes
on
it
the
golden
triangle
pghs
downtown
area
where
the
rivers
meet
graced
the
top
along
with
a
steel
mill
on
one
side
and
the
civic
arena
i
think
on
the
other
on
the
back
of
the
helmet
was
the
old
pens
logo
the
really
fat
little
penguin
with
the
blue
scarf
the
current
at
the
time
pens
logo
and
a
space
for
the
new
now
current
logo
tommy
had
designed
the
mask
and
his
mother
an
artist
painted
it
for
him
but
while
wearing
the
mask
the
pens
got
thumped
by
the
bruins
the
very
next
game
tommy
was
back
to
the
old
paint
job
a
great
mask
done
in
by
