SAD
DAY
FOR
HOCKEY
ETHAN
Z
EVANS
WRITES
OF
COURSE
PENALTIES
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
CHANGED
ROUGHING
CHAUVANISTIC
MALES
BEING
AGGRESSIVE
SLASHING
CHAUVANISTIC
MALES
VENTING
FRUSTRATION
FIGHTING
PROOF
THAT
MALES
CANNOT
COPE
WITH
THEIR
FEELINGS
NO
NO
NO
SINCE
ALL
THE
PENALTIES
FALL
INTO
THREE
CLASSES
THERE
SHOULD
ONLY
BE
THREE
PENALTIES
FOUL
ANY
ILLEGAL
CONTACT
WITH
THE
OTHER
PLAYER
OR
HIS
STICK
WITH
YOUR
BODY
OR
STICK
IF
YOU
GET
YOU
ARE
OUT
FOR
THE
GAME
UNSPORTSMANLIKE
CONTACT
AN
INTENTIONAL
FOUL
THIS
INLCLUDES
ALL
THE
CURRENT
FLAVOURS
OF
ROUGHING
FIGHTING
AND
BOARDING
IF
YOU
GET
TWO
YOU
ARE
THROWN
OUT
OF
THE
GAME
AND
FINED
TECHNICAL
FOUL
BAD
MOUTHING
THE
REF
BY
PLAYER
OR
COACH
PENALTY
SHOT
IS
AWARDED
TWO
AND
YOU
ARE
THROWN
OUT
OF
THE
GAME
BESIDES
THE
PENALTY
SHOT
FOR
ONE
TECHNICAL
IF
THE
TEAM
GETS
PENALTIES
IN
A
PERIOD
THE
OPPOSING
TEAM
GETS
A
PENALTY
SHOT
FOR
EVERY
ADDITIONAL
ONE
UNTIL
THE
END
OF
THE
PERIOD
THE
VICTIM
GETS
TWO
SHOTS
IF
HESHE
WAS
IN
THE
ACT
OF
SHOOTING
WHEN
THE
FOUL
OCURED
THIS
WORKS
WELL
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
FIRST
PENALTY
SHOTS
ARE
THE
MOST
EXCITING
THING
IN
HOCKEY
RIGHT
SO
IT
FOLLOWS
THAT
THE
MORE
THE
BETTER
NEXT
WHEN
THE
PLAYER
IS
SETTING
UP
FOR
A
PENALTY
SHOT
THE
NETWORK
CAN
TAKE
A
COMMERCIAL
FINALLY
WITH
ONLY
THREE
PENALTIES
THE
NETWORK
ANNOUNCERS
DON
MEREDITH
DICK
VITALE
JOHN
MADDEN
PAT
SUMMERALL
AND
MARV
LEVY
AMONG
OTHERS
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
TELL
THE
VIEWERS
WHAT
HAPPENED
BEFORE
THE
PA
ANNOUNCER
SAYS
IT
OH
ONE
OTHER
RULE
WHEN
A
GOAL
IS
SCORED
TIMES
A
PERIOD
THE
PLAY
CANNOT
RESUME
UNTIL
THE
PA
ANNOUNCER
ANNOUNCES
IT
THIS
WAY
THE
NETWORK
CAN
SNEAK
IN
A
FEW
MORE
COMMERCIALS
THEN
ONCE
THE
PA
ANNOUNCER
HAS
TOLD
THEM
WHO
SCORED
THE
TV
ANNOUNCER
CAN
TELL
YOU
THE
VIEWER
AND
EVEN
HAVE
A
CHANCE
OF
PRONOUNCING
HIS
NAME
RIGHT
SERIOUSLY
THOUGH
I
ACTUALLY
WENT
TO
SEE
A
NBA
BASKETBALL
GAME
LAST
WEEK
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
MY
LIFE
I
WAS
AMAZED
HOW
BORING
IT
WAS
THE
PLAY
IS
SO
SLOW
THEY
ACTUALLY
HAD
FANS
COME
OUT
FOR
THINGS
LIKE
FREETHROW
SHOOTING
CONTESTS
DURING
THE
PERIOD
OF
COURSE
THE
LAKER
GIRLS
GET
TO
DO
THEIR
ROUTINES
AT
LEAST
TIMES
DURING
THE
GAME
AND
NOT
JUST
BETWEEN
PERIODS
EITHER
THERE
IS
A
WHISTLE
EVERY
SECONDS
ON
AVERAGE
MAYBE
LESS
THE
GAME
IS
MINUTES
WITH
MINUTES
BETWEEN
QUARTERS
AND
AND
A
MINUTE
HALFTIME
AND
IT
STILL
TAKES
OVER
HOURS
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
HAS
TO
BE
TV
THERE
IS
PLENTY
OF
ROOM
TO
THROW
IN
COMMERCIALS
AND
HAVE
THE
ANNOUNCER
JABBER
WHILE
NOTHING
ELSE
IS
HAPPENING
ON
TV
BASKETBALL
IS
FAIRLY
ENTERTAINING
IMHO
BUT
IT
IS
BETTER
TO
WATCH
IT
ON
TV
THAN
TO
BE
THERE
IF
THIS
IS
THE
ROAD
THE
NHL
IS
FOLLOWING
THEN
IT
TRULY
IS
A
SAD
DAY
ENOUGH
FOR
NOW
