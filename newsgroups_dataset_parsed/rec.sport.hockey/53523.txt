MATT
BROWN
WRITES
MORE
ABOUT
THE
MESSIERSAMUELSSON
INCIDENT
WHILE
THIS
IS
TRUE
STRICTLY
SPEAKING
IT
WAS
THE
ROCKSTEADY
REPLICANT
WHO
INITIALLY
USED
HIS
STICK
ILLEGALLY
TO
MEASURE
MESSIERS
RIBCAGE
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
IN
MY
MIND
FROM
SEEING
THE
REPLAY
IN
SLOMO
THAT
WAS
COMING
AT
MESSIER
WITH
INTENTTOHASTA
LA
VISTA
IN
MIND
AND
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
GONE
FOR
THAT
I
AGREE
WITH
RICK
THAT
ULFS
CROSS
CHECK
WASNT
ILLEGAL
IT
WAS
THE
KIND
OF
CHECK
YOU
SEE
A
DOZEN
TIMES
DURING
A
GAME
WITHOUT
BEING
CALLED
SLOMOS
SOMETIMES
HAVE
A
TENDENCY
TO
MAKE
THINGS
LOOK
WORSE
THAN
THEY
REALLY
ARE
BESIDES
IF
MESSIER
CANT
TAKE
THE
HEAT
HE
SHOULD
STAY
OUT
OF
THE
KITCHEN
SO
STAFFAN
HOW
IS
MATTIAS
TIMMANDER
DOING
THIS
YEAR
AND
ANY
IMPRESSION
ON
MARKUS
CZERIEW
LOST
MY
ROSTER
LIST
ON
HAMMERBY
DOES
IT
LOOK
LIKE
THEY
WILL
MAKE
IT
TO
THE
ELITESERIEN
FOR
NEXT
YEAR
AND
THEN
GET
STOMPED
IF
MARKUS
GOES
TO
BOSTON
WELL
MATT
MATTIAS
TIMMANDER
HASNT
BEEN
PLAYING
WITH
THE
MODO
ELITE
LEAGUE
TEAM
YET
JUST
THE
MODO
JUNIOR
TEAM
SO
I
PREDICT
HE
NEEDS
A
FEW
MORE
YEARS
HERE
BEFORE
HE
CAN
JOIN
THE
BS
I
SAW
HIM
PLAY
IN
THE
SWEDISH
CHAMPIONSHIP
GAME
FOR
JUNIOR
PLAYERS
THIS
YEAR
AND
HE
PLAYED
VERY
WELL
A
PHYSICAL
GAME
BUT
NOT
THE
KIND
OF
ROUGH
STUFF
THAT
ULFIE
DOES
I
SUSPECT
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HAVE
A
ULF
TYPEOFPLAYER
ON
THE
BS
TEAM
TOO
AS
FOR
MARIUSZ
CZERKAWSKI
HE
HAS
HAD
A
GREAT
SEASON
FOR
HAMMARBY
IN
DIVISION
HE
SCORED
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
POINTS
THIS
SEASON
AND
THEN
WE
HAVE
TO
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
A
POINT
SEASON
IN
SWEDEN
IS
CONSIDERED
VERY
GOOD
DUE
TO
THE
LIMITED
NUMBER
OF
GAMES
MARIUSZ
IS
DJURGARDEN
PROPERTY
HE
WAS
JUST
ON
LOAN
TO
HAMMARBY
SO
HE
WILL
PLAY
IN
ELITSERIEN
NEXT
SEASON
UNLESS
THE
BS
CAN
GET
HIM
OF
COURSE
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
MARIUSZ
HAS
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
EXCITING
PLAYER
TO
WATCH
IN
SWEDISH
HOCKEY
THIS
SEASON
