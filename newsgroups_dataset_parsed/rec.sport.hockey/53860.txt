writes
well
now
that
the
hawks
have
won
the
division
the
road
is
a
little
easier
for
the
playoffs
let
toronto
and
detroit
beat
the
hell
out
of
each
other
while
chicago
sweeps
stlouis
that
just
makes
it
easier
in
brian
dont
be
so
sure
the
blues
played
the
hawks
pretty
well
this
season
and
won
twice
at
the
stadium
the
blues
will
give
the
hawks
a
hard
time
this
series
is
one
of
the
best
first
round
matchups
could
go
either
way
the
hawks
will
probably
prevail
in
seven
games
