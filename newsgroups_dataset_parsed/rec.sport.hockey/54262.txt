IN
ON
DONS
TIE
DON
WAS
POINTING
OUT
THE
CHARACTERS
ON
THE
TIE
BUGS
BUNNY
FOGHORN
LEGHORN
AND
YOSEMITE
SAM
WHO
DON
CALLED
LANNY
MACDONALD
RON
MACLEAN
BEGAN
BY
MENTIONING
THAT
DON
WAS
ALMOST
EVICTED
FROM
A
HOTEL
WHERE
HE
WAS
WATCHING
THE
PREVIOUS
NIGHTS
GAMES
BECAUSE
OF
ALL
THE
YELLING
AND
CHEERING
HE
WAS
DOING
OVER
THE
PLAY
OF
HUNTER
AND
FUHR
DON
BEGAN
TO
PRAISE
FUHR
CALLING
HIM
THE
GREATEST
GOALIE
AND
SAID
THAT
HES
WINNING
THE
SERIES
AGAINST
BOSTON
ALL
BY
HIMSELF
HE
THEN
SHOWED
CLIPS
FROM
EARLIER
EPISODES
NOV
JAN
WHEN
FUHR
WAS
STILL
WITH
THE
LEAFS
AND
DON
ADVISED
DONT
TRADE
FUHR
DON
WENT
ON
TO
PREDICT
THAT
IF
BUFFALO
GETS
BY
BOSTON
IT
WOULD
BE
FUHR
WHO
WINS
THE
SERIES
MUCKLER
TOOK
A
LOT
OF
HEAT
FOR
THE
TRADE
BUT
DON
FEELS
MUCKLERS
BEEN
VINDICATED
THE
NEXT
TOPIC
INVOLVED
HOW
PLAYOFF
GAMES
ARE
BEING
RUINED
BY
TOO
MANY
PENALTY
CALLS
HE
SHOWED
A
CLIP
FROM
A
WINNIPEGVANCOUVER
GAME
WHERE
DOMI
HIT
A
VANCOUVER
PLAYER
AND
WAS
GIVEN
A
MIN
PENALTY
RON
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
CALLED
A
PENALTY
BECAUSE
HIS
STICK
WAS
INVOLVED
BUT
DON
STUCK
WITH
THE
OPINION
THAT
IT
WAS
A
GOOD
HIT
WITH
DOMI
HITTING
THE
VANCOUVER
PLAYER
WITH
HIS
SHOULDER
DON
ITS
SAD
WHAT
THEYRE
DOING
FOR
HOCKEY
A
MINUTE
PENALTY
FOR
A
NOSEBLEED
NEXT
THEY
WENT
TO
THE
PLAYOFF
SERIES
BETWEEN
DETROIT
AND
TORONTO
PEOPLE
IN
DETROIT
WERE
CALLING
WENDEL
CLARKE
WENDY
FOR
NOT
FIGHTING
HOWEVER
DON
POINTED
OUT
THAT
PROBERT
WAS
NOT
FIGHTING
EITHER
THIS
LEAD
DON
INTO
A
TIRAD
ABOUT
FIGHTING
AND
STICKWORK
AND
HOW
BANNING
FIGHTING
LEADS
TO
MORE
HIGH
STICKING
ITS
LIKE
COLLEGE
HOCKEY
THE
LITTLE
WEE
GUY
WITH
THE
VISOR
IS
BRAVE
AS
ANYBODY
THATS
WHY
YOURE
SEEING
SO
MUCH
STICKWORK
BECAUSE
THEY
KNOW
YOU
WONT
DROP
YOUR
GLOVES
AND
GIVE
THEM
A
SHOT
THE
RULES
ARE
MADE
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
KNOW
WHATS
GOING
ON
IN
HOCKEY
THE
FINAL
TOPIC
DON
DISCUSSED
WAS
DALE
HUNTER
DON
POINTED
OUT
THAT
HE
WAS
LEADING
THE
LEAGUE
IN
GOALS
AND
SHOWED
A
CLIP
OF
HUNTER
FROM
A
PREVIOUS
GAME
WHEN
HE
WAS
YOUNGER
HUNTER
WAS
TAUGHT
TO
PLAY
TO
WIN
WHICH
DIFFERS
FROM
TODAYS
IDEA
OF
JUST
LETTING
KIDS
HAVE
FUN
AT
THEN
END
OF
THE
EPISODE
THEY
SHOWED
A
CLIP
FROM
A
COACHS
CORNER
WITH
THE
TAPE
ON
FAST
FORWARD
SO
THAT
DON
SOUNDED
LIKE
ONE
OF
THE
CHIPMUNKS
RATING
TYPICAL
ANTIFIGHTING
POSTURING
NOT
TOO
MUCH
HUMOUR
BUT
SOME
GOOD
