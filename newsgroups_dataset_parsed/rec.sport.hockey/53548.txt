actually
this
stuff
from
mogilny
doesnt
surprise
me
all
that
much
about
or
weeks
ago
i
read
in
the
toronto
sun
a
quote
from
alex
it
went
something
like
sarcastically
yep
pattys
the
man
hes
responsible
for
the
teams
successim
a
nobody
around
here
i
was
going
to
post
it
at
the
timei
must
have
forgot
since
nobody
else
gee
kinda
like
alexs
spot
on
the
team
isnt
it
how
can
you
assume
it
was
a
sarcastic
remark
for
someone
whose
first
language
is
not
english
i
would
interpret
that
comment
to
mean
that
he
believes
pat
is
the
mvp
on
the
team
and
that
he
is
just
one
of
the
other
normal
players
quite
modest
i
might
say
