CHHABRA
WRITES
ACTUALLY
THIS
STUFF
FROM
MOGILNY
DOESNT
SURPRISE
ME
ALL
THAT
MUCH
ABOUT
OR
WEEKS
AGO
I
READ
IN
THE
TORONTO
SUN
A
QUOTE
FROM
ALEX
IT
WENT
SOMETHING
LIKE
SARCASTICALLY
YEP
PATTYS
THE
MAN
HES
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
TEAMS
SUCCESSIM
A
NOBODY
AROUND
HERE
I
WAS
GOING
TO
POST
IT
AT
THE
TIMEI
MUST
HAVE
FORGOT
SINCE
NOBODY
ELSE
GEE
KINDA
LIKE
ALEXS
SPOT
ON
THE
TEAM
ISNT
IT
HOW
CAN
YOU
ASSUME
IT
WAS
A
SARCASTIC
REMARK
FOR
SOMEONE
WHOSE
FIRST
LANGUAGE
IS
NOT
ENGLISH
I
WOULD
INTERPRET
THAT
COMMENT
TO
MEAN
THAT
HE
BELIEVES
PAT
IS
THE
MVP
ON
THE
TEAM
AND
THAT
HE
IS
JUST
ONE
OF
THE
OTHER
NORMAL
PLAYERS
QUITE
MODEST
I
MIGHT
SAY
