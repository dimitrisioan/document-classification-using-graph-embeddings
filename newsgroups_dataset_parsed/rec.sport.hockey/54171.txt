id
like
to
see
some
playoff
games

stuck
in
buffalo
at
ub
but
i
think
boston
isnt
giving
up
so
easy
no
boston

wont
go
down
easy
but
if
the
sabres
hadnt
won
game
one
buffalo
would
have
been
out
in
four
and
what
problem
are
you
having
with
playoff
games
here
in
buffalo
theres
the
sabresbruins
quebecmontreal
and
whatever
espn
and
abc
show
and
on
opposite
nights
theres
torontodetroit
and
whatever
espnabc
shows
more
hockey
than
a
good
chunk
of
north
america
either
side
of
the
border

of
folks
