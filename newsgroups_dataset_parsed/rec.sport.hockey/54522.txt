MAKAROV
FROM

ARTICLE
NLUXENONSTANFORDEDU
NELSON
LU
WRITES
I
DONT
THINK
THE
SHARKS
SHOULD
DIG
INTO
THE
FREE
AGENT
MARKET
MOST
OF
THE
GOOD
FREE
AGENTS
WILL
REQUIRE
QUITE
A
BIT
OF
COMPENSATION
AND
SET
THE
SHARKS
BACK
AS
FAR
AS
PLAYER
DEVELOPMENT
GOES
REMEMBER
THE
SHARKS
WERE
UNWILLING
TO
GIVE
UP
PLAYERS
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
MILLION
THEY
OFFERED
FOR
JOE
MURPHY
AND
I
THINK
THATS
A
GOOD
APPROACH
THEY
TRIED
TO
SIGN
SERGEI
MAKAROV
BEFORE
THIS
SEASON
BECAUSE
MAKAROV
WOULDNT
HAVE
REQUIRED
COMPENSATION
MATCHING
THE
MAKAROV
OFFER
WAS
THE
ONLY
REAL
MISTAKE
DAVE
KING
HAS
MADE
THIS
YEAR
I
HAVE
TO
WONDER
ABOUT
THE
INTELLIGENCE
OF
SIGNING
A
OLD
WHO
IS
OBVIOUSLY
ON
THE
DOWNSIDE
OF
HIS
CAREER
TO
A
MILLION
CONTRACT
RISEBROUGH
MATCHED
THE
OFFER
ON
KINGS
REQUEST
AND
MAKAROV
HAS
SPENT
THE
LAST
QUARTER
OF
THE
SEASON
IN
THE
PRESS
BOX
BECAUSE
HIS
WORK
ETHIC
JUST
PLAIN
STINKS
NOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
HES
LOST
A
STEP
AND
CAN
NO
LONGER
GET
HIMSELF
INTO
POSITION
TO
MAKE
THE
NIFTY
PASSES
I
THINK
MAKAROV
WILL
BE
AVAILABLE
FOR
FREE
THIS
OFFSEASON
TO
ANYBODY
WHO
AGREES
TO
PAY
HIS
CONTRACT
HES
INEFFECTIVE
IN
CALGARY
BUT
HE
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
HELP
A
TEAM
LIKE
SAN
JOSE
WITH
THEIR
SHORTAGE
OF
TALENT
IF
THERES
NO
TAKERS
AND
MAKAROV
DOESNT
SHOW
IMPROVEMENT
IN
TRAINING
CAMP
I
THINK
THE
FLAMES
WILL
JUST
BITE
THE
BULLET
AND
BUY
OUT
MAKAROVS
CONTRACT
AND
RELEASE
HIM
WITH
HIS
CURRENT
ATTITUDE
HE
IS
A
DETRIMENT
TO
THE
TEAM
ALAN
