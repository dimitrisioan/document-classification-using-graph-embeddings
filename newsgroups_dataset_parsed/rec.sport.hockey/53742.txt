the
most
average
player
in
the
nhl
and
now
i
interrupt
your
regularly
scheduled
news
reading
to
bring
you
another
message
sponsored
by
the
department
of
really
mundane
statistics
i
passed
the
final
individual
player
stats
posted
here
the
other
day
through
a
filter
to
average
out
games
goals
assists
points
and
penalty
minutes
for
the
mythical
average
nhl
pro
who
played
in
the
league
this
season
why
because
its
monday
and
i
didnt
feel
like
writing
any
real
code
anyway
after
i
wiped
out
the
goalies
in
the
list
i
came
up
with
nhl
average
gp
g
a
pts
pim
then
i
passed
the
list
through
a
second
time
to
come
up
with
the
players
who
had
the
smallest
percentage
difference
in
each
of
the
categories
marty
mcinnis
nyi
gp
g
a
pts
pim
igor
kravchuk
edm
gp
g
a
pts
pim
these
two
are
close
in
games
goals
assists
and
points
but
are
too
far
off
in
pim
this
leaves
as
the
most
average
player
in
the
nhl
bobby
carpenter
was
gp
g
a
pts
pim
what
an
honor
i
also
passed
the
list
through
with
the
goalies
still
included
kravchuk
and
carpenter
were
still
in
the
top
three
but
rob
dimaio
came
flying
up
from
behind
to
take
the
title

its
all
really
