thats
not
inner
calm
its
boredom
and
its
being
spoiled
the
arenas
been
as
quiet
as
a
church
on
many
nights
this
year
too
many
of
us
just
take
winning
for
granted
its
been
seemingly
forever
since
the
team
lost
and
weve
forgotten
what
its
like
to
feel
real
excitement
and
surprise
at
victory
at
least
last
night
there
was
some
excitement
the
pens
didnt
have
it
wrapped
up
before
the
game
was
half
over
like
the
previous
two
games
im
not
sure
if
nj
just
rose
up
and
played
better
or
if
the
penguins
just
started
to
play
down
somewhat
probably
it
was
somewhere
in
between
new
jersey
seemed
much
more
aggressive
last
night
in
the
pens
end
they
did
much
more
swarming
around
which
at
least
kept
an
element
of
suspense
in
the
game
no
question
that
billington
helped
make
it
more
interesting
also
claude
lemieux
didnt
help
the
cause
any
though
with
his
ejection
early
in
the
game
so
whos
going
to
start
in
the
devils
goal
for
the
final
game
sunday
sorry
i
couldnt
help
myself
