AN
INTERESTING
NOTE
I
HAVE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
RECOLLECTION
WHO
WAS
ON
MY
TEAM
I
PICKED
ALL
MY
PLAYERS
ABOUT
WEEKS
BEFORE
THE
START
OF
THE
SEASON
AND
THEN
NEVER
TOUCHED
THE
ROSTER
AGAIN
I
GOT
WRAPPED
UP
IN
MY
OWN
MONEY
POOL
AND
DECIDED
NOT
TO
GET
INVOLVED
AT
ALL
WITH
THE
USENET
POOL
SORRY
ANDREW
BTW
THE
ONLY
THING
I
REMEMBER
ABOUT
MY
TEAM
IS
THAT
I
HAD
JOE
SACCO
AND
MAYBE
JOHN
MACLEAN
MAYBE
FRANCIS
AND
KEVIN
STEVENS
AS
WELL
OUT
OF
CURIOUSITY
I
CHECKED

TO
FIND

AMAZEMENT

ABSOLUTELY
NO
INPUT

INITIAL

NOT
SURE

THAT
IMPLIES
FOR
THOSE
