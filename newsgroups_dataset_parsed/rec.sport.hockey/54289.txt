an
interesting
note
i
have
absolutely
no
recollection
who
was
on
my
team
i
picked
all
my
players
about
weeks
before
the
start
of
the
season
and
then
never
touched
the
roster
again
i
got
wrapped
up
in
my
own
money
pool
and
decided
not
to
get
involved
at
all
with
the
usenet
pool
sorry
andrew
btw
the
only
thing
i
remember
about
my
team
is
that
i
had
joe
sacco
and
maybe
john
maclean
maybe
francis
and
kevin
stevens
as
well
out
of
curiousity
i
checked
the
final
standings
today
on
rsh
only
to
find
to
my
amazement
that
with
absolutely
no
input
the
initial
team
still
managed
to
finsh
im
not
sure
what
that
implies
for
those
who
finished
below
me
