RE
THIS
YEARS
BIGGEST
AND
WORST
OPINION
I
CAN
ONLY
COMMENT
ON
THE
KINGS
BUT
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
CANDIDATE
FOR
PLEASANT
SURPRISE
IS
ALEX
ZHITNIK
HE
CAME
HIGHLY
TOUTED
AS
A
DEFENSIVE
DEFENSEMAN
BUT
HES
CLEARLY
MUCH
MORE
THAN
THAT
GREAT
SKATER
AND
HARD
SHOT
THOUGH
WISH
HE
WERE
MORE
ACCURATE
IN
FACT
HE
PRETTY
MUCH
ALLOWED
THE
KINGS
TO
TRADE
AWAY
THAT
HUGE
DEFENSIVE
LIABILITY
PAUL
COFFEY
KELLY
HRUDEY
IS
ONLY
THE
BIGGEST
DISAPPOINTMENT
IF
YOU
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
ANY
GOOD
TO
BEGIN
WITH
BUT
AT
BEST
HES
ONLY
A
MEDIOCRE
GOALTENDER
A
BETTER
CHOICE
WOULD
BE
TOMAS
SANDSTROM
THOUGH
NOT
THROUGH
ANY
FAULT
OF
HIS
OWN
BUT
BECAUSE
SOME
THUGS
IN
TORONTO
DECIDED
TO
THREATEN
HIS
CAREER
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
CONCEDING
A
GOAL
OTHER
THAN
THAT
THE
AWARD
GOES
TO
ROBERT
LANG
AN
UNINSPIRING
CZECH
ROBITAILLE
COULD
EASILY
BE
MVP
BUT
ID
PREFER
TO
GIVE
IT
TO
ROB
BLAKE
WHO
IS
QUIETLY
BECOMING
ONE
OF
THE
LEAGUES
PREMIER
DEFENSEMEN
AND
IF
THE
KINGS
MANAGE
TO
HOLD
ONTO
HIM
AND
THE
REST
OF
OUR
YOUNG
DEFENSE
IT
COULD
ONE
DAY
MEAN
THAT
WELL
LET
IN
FEWER
GOALS
THAN
HARTFORD
HONORABLE
MENTIONS
TO
MAJESTIC
MARTY
AND
WARREN
RYCHEL
JON
