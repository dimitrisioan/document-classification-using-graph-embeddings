all
you
canucks
fan
out
there
winnipeg
are
going
to
kick
vancouvers
butts
so
badly
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
sit
down
for
weeks
and
no
this
is
not
a
joke
a
prediction
before
the
fourth
game
in
winnipeg
winnipeg
vancouver
selanne
steen
score
a
couple
of
goals
each
winnipeg
to
win
stanley
cup
playoffs
to
all
you
jets
fanaticsha
ha
ha
to
normal
jets
fansit
was
a
pretty
good
fourth
game
more
physical
play
than
ive
seen
in
the
first
three
games
these
moronic
posts
that
have
continued
throughout
the
year
about
how
the
jets
will
cremeate
the
canucks
and
selanne
will
smash
bure
into
the
boards
is
so
full
of
it
why
dont
you
take
a
cue
fromm
daryl
and
just
wait
till
its
over
before
you
make
more
of
a
fool
of
yourself
im
not
going
to
predict
anything
about
the
canucks
they
are
up
and
are
coming
back
home
but
im
not
going
swing
any
it
around
until
the
series
is
wrapped
up
tony
bravo
tony
i
too
am
sick
of
all
the
mindless
fanatical
blind
faith
jets
fans
who
could
prpbably
predict
the
end
of
the
world
more
accurately
than
the
coutcome
of
a
playoff
series
now
i
will
admit
that
i
am
a
mindless
fanatica
blind
faith
canucks
fan
but
unlike
those
from
winterpeg
i
do
not
need
to
vent
my
spleen
upon
the
world
as
to
how
great
my
team
is
i
know
i
have
confidence
in
them
and
thats
enough
granted
the
jets
finished
the
season
hot
and
the
canucks
were
having
trouble
but
vancouver
has
built
themselves
a
reputation
for
being
a
playoff
team
just
ask
any
flames
fan
they
may
not
win
every
series
but
they
alway
fight
to
the
end
ill
admit
that
last
year
was
not
great
but
if
they
combine
the
work
ethic
of
the
past
with
the
new
tallent
of
the
present
they
will
be
tough
to
beat
note
i
did
not
say
they
would
pummel
every
team
they
meet
and
destroy
the
greatest
player
playing
today
now
like
any
canucks
fan
i
would
love
to
see
them
take
the
cup
i
feel
they
have
a
good
chance
to
make
it
out
of
the
smythe
and
a
shot
at
detroit
i
cant
see
them
losing
to
st
louis
if
pittsburgh
makes
it
to
the
cup
id
have
to
put
my
money
on
them
yes
even
if
theyre
facing
the
canucks
if
buffalo
montreal
or
quebec
beat
pittsburgh
id
choose
the
winner
of
vancuover
and
detroit
to
take
the
cup
oh
and
one
parting
note
for
the
jets
fans
just
how
many
times
has
winnepeg
made
it
to
the
finals
go
canucks
greg
devorski
unfortunately
helped
to
taint
an
otherwise
brilliant
display
by
maclean
the
canucks
tied
up
the
jets
so
tightly
that
i
thought
that
they
were
mailing
them
btw
gregnext
time
dont
fall
asleep
in
geography
class
its
pretty
sad
when
a
fellow
in
norway
can
spell
winnipeg
properly
and
a
guy
in
north
america
cant
one
more
thinghow
long
has
vancouver
been
in
the
nhl
how
many
championships
do
they
have
oh
yeahand
i
can
go
to
the
arena
and
see
not
one
not
two
but
six
championship
banners
hanging
from
the
rafters
stanley
cup
banners
and
avco
cup
banners
my
nhl
guide
says
that
vancouver
has
won
the
cup
once
as
many
times
as
the
rockin
town
of
kenora
has
won
it
