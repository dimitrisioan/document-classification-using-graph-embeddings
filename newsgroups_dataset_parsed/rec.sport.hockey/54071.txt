clement
although
he
has
a
pleasant
personality
aggravatingly
pleasant
in
my
opinion
is
a
terrible
analyst
because
he
is
almost
alway
wrongthe
prototypical
example
being
new
jerseys
first
goal
last
sunday
i
grew
up
with
dick
irvin
doing
color
beside
danny
gallivani
knew
did
irvin
dick
irvin
was
a
friend
of
minebill
clement
you
arent
any
dick
irvin
as
long
as
the
teams
involved
do
not
include
the
us
national
team
or
the
new
york
rangers
id
take
john
davidson
over
bill
clement
any
day
personality
means
something
to
me
that
is
exactly
why
i
like
clement
and
emrick
on
the
other
hand
jd
is
a
pompous
bullheaded
arrogant
knowitall
hes
a
real
turnoff
which
is
exactly
what
i
do
when
hes
on
one
complaint
i
do
have
about
clement
is
that
he
sometimes
talks
too
much
if
i
wanted
that
id
listen
to
tim
mcgarver
doing
a
baseball
game
