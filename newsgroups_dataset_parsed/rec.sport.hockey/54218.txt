THAT
WOMAN
WHO
SANG
THE
ANTHEMS
WE
HAD
TO

DOWN
THE
VOLUME
THE
FLYERS
DEFENSE
STARTED
OUT
THE
GAME
SHOWING
EVERYBODY
WHY
THE
FLYERS
HAVE
BEEN
SHUTTING
TEAMS
OUT
LATELY
BY
HOLDING
THE
SABRES
TO
ONLY
SHOTS
IN
THE
FIRST
PERIOD
THEY
THEN
SHOWED
EVERYBODY
WHY
THEY
WILL
BE
PLAYING
GOLF
SUNDAY
WHEN
THEY
GAVE
UP
SHOTS
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
PERIODS
MAYBE
TOMMY
TOLD
THEM
THAT
HE
WAS
GETTING
BORED
BACK
THERE
MARK

OPENED
THE

SO
FAST
THAT
IF
YOU
BLINKED
YOU
MISSED
IT

WRAPPED
THE

DRIFTED

DRIFTED
BACK

AND
SLID
THE
PUCK
BACK
TO
THE

PAST
FUHR
FOR
A
FLYERS
LEAD
AT
IT
WAS
SO
BEAUTIFUL
ERIC
AND
GARRY
SHOULD
TURN
DOWN
THEIR
ASSISTS
THE
FLYERS
KEPT
THE
PRESSURE
ON
FUHR
FOR
A
WHILE
AFTER
THAT
BUT
HE
WAS
STRONG
AND
KEPT
THE
FLYERS
FROM
DOING
FURTHER
DAMAGE
THE
GAME
THEN
BECAME
A
DEFENSIVE
STRUGGLE
FOR
A
WHILE
THE
SABRES
GOT
THE
FIRST
CHANCE
ON
THE
POWER
PLAY
WHEN
TERRY
CARKNER
TOOK
A
BOARDING
MINOR
AT
FOR
CRUNCHING
DALE
HAWERCHUK
INTO
THE

IN
THE
FLYERS

LAFONTAINE
GOT
THE
ONLY

AND
NOT
A
TERRIBLY
GOOD
ONE
AS
THE

SMOTHERED
THE

MOGILNY
GOT
A
POST
AFTER
IT

KEITH
CARNEY
TOOK
A

TO
GIVE
THE

A
POWER
PLAY
THE
BEST
PENALTY
KILLING
TEAM
IN
THE
LEAGUE
DIDNT
ALLOW
THE
FLYERS
A
SHOT
ON
GOAL
ALTHOUGH
THE
FLYERS
DID
CREATE
A
GOOD
SCORING
CHANCE
FOR
LINDROS
WHO
PARTIALLY
FANNED
ON
HIS
SHOT
TOWARDS
THE
END
OF
THE
PERIOD
THE
PLAY
STARTED
GOING
END
TO
END
BUT
EVERYBODY
KEPT
MISSING
THE
NET
GREG
HAWGOOD
TOOK
AN
INTERFERENCE
PENALTY
AT
TO
GIVE
THE
SABRES
ANOTHER
POWER
PLAY
BUT
THEY
COULDNT
GET
ANYTHING
GOING
AND
THE
FANS
EXPRESSED
THEIR
DISPLEASURE
PARTICULARLY
WHEN
THEY
ICED
THE
PUCK
SHOTS
WERE
BUFFALO
AFTER
THE
FLYERS
HAD
LED
AT
ONE
POINT
MIKE
EMRICK
INTERVIEWED
FLYERS
PRESIDENT
JAY
SNIDER
BETWEEN
PERIODS
JAY
WAS
DISAPPOINTED
TO
NOT
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
BUT
NOT
DISCOURAGED
THIS
WAS
CONSIDERED
A
REBUILDING
YEAR
AFTER
THE
TRADE
AND
HE
SEEMED
VERY
HAPPY
WITH
THE
WAY
THE
SEASON
WENT
WHEN
ASKED
IF
HE
AGONIZED
OVER
THE
TRADE
HE
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
RUSS
FARWELLS
TRADE
AND
NOT
HIS
THAT
IT
ONLY
WAS
AN
ISSUE
FOR
HIM
AND
ED
SNIDER
AS
FAR
AS
THE
MONEY
BUT
YES
THERE
WAS
SOME
AGONIZING
AND
THEYD
DO
IT
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
WHEN
ASKED
HOW
THE
COACHING
SITUATION
WOULD
BE
HANDLED
FOR
NEXT
YEAR
HE
SAID
THAT
ITS
RUSS
CALL
AND
RUSS
WILL
EVALUATE
THINGS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
HE
FEELS
THAT
THEYRE
YEARS
AWAY
FROM
A
SHOT
AT
THE
CUP
HE
EXPECTS
TO
GET
INTO
THE
PLAYOFFS
NEXT
YEAR
HAVE
A
SHOT
AT
A
DIVISION
TITLE
THE
FOLLOWING
YEAR
AND
A
SHOT
AT
THE
FINALS
THE
YEAR
AFTER
THAT
THIS
BASED
ON
THE
CURRENT
LEVEL
OF
PLAY
AND
ANTICIPATED
IMPROVEMENTS
OVER
THE
SUMMER
HES
VERY
HAPPY
WITH
THE
REALIGNMENT
HE
CALLED
IT
OUTSTANDING
HAPPY
WITH
THE
CURRENT
EXPANSION
FEELS
THAT
THE
TALENT
POOL
IS
BIG
ENOUGH
WITH
THE
UNFLUX
OF
EUROPEANS
BUT
FEELS
THAT
THEY
MUST
MAKE
SURE
EXISTING
FRANCHISES
ARE
STABLE
SEEMED
TO
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
PLAYING
IN
THE
OLYMPICS
BOOO
BUT
SAID
THAT
THERE
WAS
A
DEFINITE
SPLIT
AMONG
OWNERS
AND
THAT
THIS
CERTAINLY
WOULD
ONLY
HAPPEN
IN
FOUR
YEARS
IF
THERE
WAS
A
CONSENSUS
THE
SABRES
GAVE
THE
FLYERS
THEIR
SECOND
POWER
PLAY
OF
THE
GAME
WHEN
BRAD
MAY
TOOK
A
TRIPPING
PENALTY
AT
OF
THE
SECOND
THE
FLYERS
HAD
A
LITTLE
TROUBLE
GETTING
STARTED
BUT
EVENTUALLY
DID
HAWGOOD
TOOK
A
PASS
AS
HE
WAS
MOVING
THROUG
THE
NEUTRAL
ZONE
AND
HANDED
THE
PUCK
TO
EKLUND
JUST
OUTSIDE
THE
SABRES
BLUE
LINE
ALONG
THE
RIGHT
BOARDS
EKLUND
CARRIED
INTO
THE
ZONE
NAD
PASSED
ACROSS
TO
DINEEN
WHO
TRIED
A
ONE
TIMER
FROM
BETWEEN
THE
BLUE
LINE
AND
THE
TOP
OF
THE
LEFT
CIRCLE
HE
HALF
FANNED
ON
IT
AND
SENT
THE
PUCK
TRICKLING
THROUGH
THE
SLOT
FUHR
DIDNT
KNOW
WHERE
IT
WAS
THOUGH
AND
HAWGOOD
WON
THE
RACE
TO
IT
AND
FLIPPED
IT
INTO
ESSENTIALLY
AN
OPEN
NET
AT
THEN
MOGILNY
ON
A
BREAKAWAY
HE
SLIPPED
THROUGH
TWO
FLYERS
AT
THE
BLUE
LINE
AND
WENT
IN
ON
SODERSTROM
HE
WENT
WITH
THE
BACKHANDER
BUT
SODERSTROM
WAS
ALL
OVER
IT
THE
FLYERS
THEN
TOOK
SOME
BAD
DISCIPLINE
TYPE
PENALTIES
THAT
REALLY
HURT
THEM
VIACHESLAV
BUTSAYEV
TOOK
A
DOUBLE
MINOR
FOR
ROUGHING
AND
HIGH
STICKING
WHEN
BARNABY
GOT
UNDER
HIS

AND
DREW

THEN
ACCORDING
TO
GARY
DORNHOEFER
TOOK
A
DIVE
TO

THERE
WAS
NO

COUDLNT
GET

RYAN
MCGILL
POKED
AT
THE
PUCK
JUST
AFTER
A
SABRE
CARRIED
INTO
THE
FLYERS
ZONE
AND
AFTER
A
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
POKED
AT
IT
DINEEN
EMERGED
WITH
IT
AND
HEADED
THE
OTHER
WAY
IT
STARTED
OUT
A
ON
BUT
BRINDAMOUR
HUSTLED
AHEAD
TO
MAKE
IT
A
ON
AND
BACK
OFF
THE
DEFENSEMAN
DINEEN
LET
IT
RIP
FROM
THE
TOP
OF
THE

TO
MAKE
IT
FLYERS
AT
THAT
WAS
ALL
FOR
FUHR
JOHN
MUCKLER
SENT
IN
DOMINIK
HASEK
TO
TAKE
OVER
BUT
THE
SABRES
STILL
HAD
LOTS
OF
POWER
PLAY
TIME
AGAIN
THEY
TOOK
SOME
TIME
TO
JUST
GET
INTO
THE
FLYERS
ZONE
AND
WHEN
THEY
FINALLY
DID
THE
FLYERS
WERE
ALL
OVER
THEM
BOOS
BEGAN
TO
RING
THROUGH
THE
BUILDING
BUT
THEY
FINALLY
GOT
THROUGH
SODERSTROM
ON
AN
UGLY
GOAL
SMEHLIK
TOOK
A
SHOT
FROM
THE
TOP
OF
THE
ZONE
THAT
MISSED
AND
KICKED
OUT
TO
HAWERCHUK
IN
THE
SLOT
HAWERCHUK
TRIED
A
BACKHANDER
AS
HE
SKATED
TOWARDS
THE
GOAL
LINE
TO
THE
RIGHT
AS
GALLEY
DOVE
DOWN
TO
BLOCK
IT
MISTAKE
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
LET
SODERSTROM
HANDLE
THE
BACKHANDER
AND
WORRIED
ABOUT
A
THE
REBOUND
OR
B
BARNABY
WHO
WAS
CAMPED
BEHIND
THE
GOAL
LINE
RIGHT
NEXT
TO
THE
NET
WELL
THE
REBOUND
DROPPED
RIGHT
NEXT
TO
SODERSTROM
AND
MISTAKE
GALLEY
JUST
LAID
THERE
AND
WATCHED
BARNABY
GET
THREE
HACKS
AT
THE
PUCK
BEFORE
HE
FINALLY
PUSHED
IT
THROUGH
THE
GOALIE
HE
DIDNT
EVEN
SWING
HIS
STICK
OUT
TO
TRY
AND
KNOCK
THE
PUCK
AWAY
WITH
THE
GOAL
AT
TWO
STREAKS
END
FOR
THE
FLYERS
OF
SHUTOUT
HOCKEY
AND
STRAIGHT
PENALTY
KILLS
LINDROS
PUT
THEM
RIGHT
BACK
ON
THE
POWER
PLAY
AT
WITH
A
HIGH
STICKING
MINOR
I
THINK
IT
WAS
BARNABY
AGAIN
THIS
TIME
THE
SABRES
WERE
ABLE
TO
GET
SET
UP
QUICKLY
BUT
COULDNT
GET
TOO
MUCH
QUALITY
ON
GOAL
THE
SABRES
CONTINUED
TO
KEEP
THE
PUCK
IN
THE
FLYERS
END
FOR
A
WHILE
AFTER
THE
POWER
PLAY
ENDED
THINGS
EVETUALLY
SETTLED
DOWN
BUT
THEN
THE
OTHER
VERY
BAD
PENALTY
MCGILL
ALLOWED
BARNABY
TO
GET
UNDER
HIS
SKIN
AND
SLASHED
HIS
STICK
JUST
BEFORE
A
FACEOFF
THE
GLOVES
WERE
DROPPED
AND
MCGILL
STARTED
POUNDING
THE
CRAP
OUT
OF
HIM
BUT
DURING
THE
FIGHT
HE
GAVE
BARNABY
A
HEAD
BUTT
WITH
HIS
HELMET
AND
THAT
MEANT
A
MATCH
PENALTY
FOR
SLASHING
FIGHTING
AND
FOR
THE
MAJOR
MINUTES
OF
POWER
PLAY
TIME
FOR
THE
SABRES
AT
BARNABY
ONLY
GOT
THE
FLYERS
WERE
KEEPING
THEM
AT
BAY
FOR
A
WHILE
BUT
THERE
WAS
ONLY
SO
LONG
THEY
COULD
DO
THAT
AFTER
A
COUPLE
OF
GOOD
SABRE
CHANCES
AUDETTE
HANDED
TO
LEDYARD
AT
THE

AND

JUST
SLID

ACTUALLY
TRYING
TO
PUT

HALF
FANNED
ON

AND
GOT
A
BREAK
THE
FLYERS
THEN
GOT
SOME
SHORTHANDED
PRESSURE
IN
THE

ZONE
BUT
HASEK
WAS
STRONG
FINALLY
IT
WAS
KEITH
CARNEY
PASSING
AHEAD
TO

INTO

SENT
A
GOOD

ANOTHER
MINIBREAKAWAY
FOR
MOGILNY
HE
ELECTED
TO
SHOOT
FROM

AND
HE
THREADED
THE
NEEDLE
TO
GET
IT
JUST
INSIDE
THE
FAR

AT
FOR
HIS
OF
THE
SEASON
IRONICALLY
THE
YOUTH
HOCKEY
TIP
BETWEEN
THE

WAS
TOMMY
SODERSTROM
TALKING
ABOUT
CUTTING
OFF

THAT
WAS

BLEW
A

HAD
ALMOST
NO

HIT
THE

FOR
SOME
STRANGE
REASON
AND
IN
THE
MEANTIME
EMRICK
AND
DORNHOEFER
TRY
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
THEY
COULD
BE
REVIEWING
WELL
IT
TURNS
OUT
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
TAPED
UP
STICK
BLADE
THAT
WENT
INTO
THE
NET
NOT
THE
PUCK
EMRICK
MENTIONS
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
CRITERIA
FOR
SCORING
A
GOAL
IS
THAT
THE
PUCK
MUST
GO
INTO

DAVE
HANNAN
THEN
TOOK
OUT

AND
GOT
A
HOLDING
MINOR
AT

FOR

NOT
MUCH

ON
THE

RESULTING
POWER
PLAY
PLAY
WENT
END
TO
END
FOR
QUITE
A

AFTER
THAT
AND
BOTH
GOALIES
HAD
TO
MAKE
SOME
BIG
SAVES
THE
SABRES
WERENT
ABLE
TO
PULL
HASEK
AS
TIME
WAS
RUNNING
OUT
AS
THE
FLYERS
WOULDNT
ALLOW
ANY
CONSISTANT
POSSESSION
FOR
THE

FINALLY
AS

OUT
KEN
SUTTON
MISPLAYED
THE

SCORING
SHOTS
WERE
BUFFALO
AND
THE
ICE
WAS
SHOWERED
WITH
PLASTIC
DRINKING
MUGS
HANDED
OUT
BEFORE
THE

SO
ANOTHER
STRONG
GAME
FROM
TOMMY
SODERSTROM
WHO
HADNT
BEEN
TESTED
MUCH
IN
HIS
LAST
COUPLE
OF
STARTS
KEVIN
DINEEN
HAS
A
CAREER
HIGH
POINT
NIGHT
UNLESS
HE
HAD
A
BETTER
NIGHT
EARLIER
IN
THE

BUT
I
DONT
THINK
SO
THE
FLYERS
LONGEST
WINNING
STREAK
IN
YEARS
GOALS
FOR
ONLY
AGAINST
WITH
THREE
SHUTOUTS
ERIC
LINDROS
IS
IN

WITH
EVEN
STRENGTH
GOALS
DESPITE
MISSING

WITH
INJURY
POINTS
OUT
OF

SINCE
THE

LOSE

A

MISC
NOTES
FORGET
THE
MIKE

RUMORS
THERE
WILL
BE
A

TO
ANNOUNCE
THAT
HE
WILL
BE
HEAD

OF
THE

NEXT

IN
THE
LAST

I
MENTIONED
THAT
GARRY
GALLEY
WON
THE

BUT
I
FAILED
TO
MENTION
