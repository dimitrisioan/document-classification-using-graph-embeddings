RE
TRULY
A
SAD
DAY
FOR
HOCKEY
FAREWELL
MINNESOTA
FANS
GET
STUFFED
DALLAS
STARS
AS
THE
NORTH
STARS
FADE
TO
BLACK
I
HOPE
THAT
MINNEAPOLISST
PAUL
ARE
NOT
LONG
WITHOUT
AN
NHL
TEAM
IT
JUST
SEEMS
RIGHT
THAT
THE
HOTBED
OF
AMATEUR
HOCKEY
IN
THE
USA
SHOULD
HAVE
AN
NHL
TEAM
AS
WELL
THE
LOSS
OF
THE
TEAM
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
FANS
THOUGH
THE
START
OF
THE
SEASON
MADE
IT
LOOK
REAL
BAD
FOR
A
WHILE
I
WISH
NOW
THAT
I
KEPT
THE
NORTH
STARS
CAP
I
BOUGHT
AT
MAPLE
LEAF
GARDENS
THE
MORNING
AFTER
THEY
ELIMINATED
MONTREAL
IN
I
GOT
IT
TO
SPITE
THE
MONTREAL
FANS
IN
THE
SMALL
TOWN
WHERE
I
GREW
UP
WHAT
A
GLORIOUS
SEASON
THAT
WAS
FOR
THE
NORTH
STARS

I
DONT
MEAN
TO
TELL
YOU
HOW
TO
LIVE
INTERNET
YOUR
LIFETHATS
WHAT
THE
TVS
FOR
I
WORK
FOR
BNR
I
DO
NOT
SPEAK
FOR
IT
BUT
IF

DIDNT
BELIEVE
IN
JESUS
ID
BE
GOING
TO
HELL
