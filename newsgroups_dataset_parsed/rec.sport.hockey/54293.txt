play
game
btw
final
score
was
habs
the
score
might
be
a
bit
misleading
the
habs
dominated
the
game
from
the
mark
of
the
first
and
then
on
the
score
should
have
been
if
it
werent
for
some
miraculous
save
from
a
ron
hextall
bastard
hes
the
reason
the
score
was
as
close
habs
winning
goal
was
scored
by
benoit
brunet
at
of
the
roy
had
an
ok
game
he
made
the
first
save
one
way
or
another
and
the
defense
was
there
to
clear
any
rebounds
this
just
in
espn
radio
reports
that
the
bruins
lost
in
ot
yahooooooooooo
those
suckers
got
what
they
deserved
