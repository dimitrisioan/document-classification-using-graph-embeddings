A
GRACA
WRITES
I
ALSO
THINK
THAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
WITH
PITTSBURGH
IF
THEY
FACE
THEM
IN
THE
FINALS
WHICH
IS
WHAT
ALL
THE
DETROIT
SPORTSWRITERS
ARE
PREDICTING
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
BRYAN
MURRAY
IS
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
GM
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN
IN
HOCKEY
IM
NOT
AS
IMPRESSED
WITH
HIS
ABILITIES
AS
A
BENCH
COACH
OR
IN
GENERAL
AS
A
MOTIVATOR
WITH
THE
AMOUNT
OF
TALENT
HE
HAS
ON
THIS
TEAM
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
BLOWN
AWAY
EVERYONE
IN
THE
NORRIS
THERE
IS
NOT
ANOTHER
TEAM
IN
THE
NORRIS
MAYBE
EVEN
IN
THE
CAMPBELL
CONFERENCE
THAT
CAN
HOLD
A
CANDLE
TO
DETROIT
ON
PAPER
IN
TERMS
OF
PURE
TALENT
BUT
SOME
GUYS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
PULLING
THEIR
WEIGHT
AT
TIMES
THIS
YEAR
SCOTTY
BOWMAN
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WHO
HAS
WON
I
THINK
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
NINE
STANLEY
CUPS
IS
AN
OUTSTANDING
COACH
AND
I
THINK
HE
COULD
OUTCOACH
MURRAY
IF
THEY
FACED
EACH
OTHER
BRYAN
MURRAY
HAS
DONE
VERY
LITTLE
AS
GMYZERMAN

THE
WHOLE
RUSSIAN
STRATEGY
WAS
A
PRODUCT
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
GMMURRAY
HAS
MADE
A
COUPLE
OF
DECENT
TRADESTHATS
ABOUT

THAT
WOULD
HARDLY
RANK
