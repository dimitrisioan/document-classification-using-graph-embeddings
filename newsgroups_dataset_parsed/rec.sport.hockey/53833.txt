i
think
that
jack
ferreiras
firing
eventually
led
to
kingstons
firing
you
mention
consistency
of
vision
i
think
the
sharks
lost
that
with
the
loss
of
ferreira
there
has
never
been
a
headed
gm
that
has
ever
worked
you
need
one
person
making
the
personnel
decisions
at
the
top
not
management
by
committee
the
conventional
wisdom
from
around
the
league
is
that
ferreira
would
have
made
the
moves
that
would
have
fielded
a
better
product
on
the
ice
how
exactly
would
ferreira
accomplished
this
the
threeheaded
gmship
has
taken
a
lot
of
heat
but
nobodys
explained
how
things
would
have
been
any
different
had
ferreira
still
been
there
would
ferreira
have
made
more
trades
who
would
have
he
had
traded
would
he
have
made
fewer
trades
who
should
not
have
been
traded
i
think
the
threeheaded
gms
guiding
principle
was
to
keep
veterans
in
favor
of
youngsters
only
if
they
offered
a
significant
advantage
at
the
end
of
last
season
the
contracts
of
several
veterans
with
somewhat
maginal
contributions
fenton
bozek
anderson
and
a
couple
others
i
cant
remember
were
bought
out
the
idea
was
that
youngsters
could
play
almost
as
well
and
had
the
potential
to
improve
where
these
older
guys
did
not
and
they
traded
mullen
because
he
wanted
to
go
not
because
he
wasnt
good
enough
but
i
think
they
were
a
bit
too
optimistic
in
thinking
they
could
make
up
for
his
contributions
an
example
from
this
season
skriko
was
brought
in
on
a
trial
basis
but
not
kept
because
of
his
age
i
thought
he
was
a
decent
contributor
worth
keeping
around
the
youth
movement
has
its
advantages
look
at
gaudreau
who
might
still
be
in
kc
if
more
veterans
had
been
kept
around
but
you
have
to
find
the
right
balance
