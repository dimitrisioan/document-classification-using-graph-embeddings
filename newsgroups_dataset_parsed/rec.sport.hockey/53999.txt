BOWMAN
NEEDS
CREDIT
DURING
THE
FIRST
THREE
GAMES
OF
THE
PENSDEVILS
SERIES
I
HAVE
BEEN
IMPRESSED
TIME
AND
TIME
AGAIN
BY
THE
PURE
TALENT
OF
THE
PENS
JAGR
MACEACHERN
AND
BARRASSO
HAVE
BEEN
ESPECIALLY
FUN
TO
WATCH
BUT
ONE
ELEMENT
OF
THIS
TEAM
WHICH
GOES
UNNOTICED
SEEMS
TO
BE
SCOTTY
BOWMAN
DESPITE
BROOKS
LUNATIC
COMMENTS
AND
DESPITE
THE
DEVILS
LINE
CHANGING
ADANTAGE
IN
LAST
NIGHTS
GAME
BOWMAN
HAS
BEEN
ABLE
TO
KEEP
HIS
COOL
AND
KEEP
THE
DEVILS
IN
THE
DARK
GRANTED
THE
HELLDWELLERS
HAD
THE
PENS
BOTTLED
UP
FOR
A
WHILE
LAST
NIGHT
BUT
BOWMAN
WAS
EVENTUALLY
ABLE
TO
CONFIGURE
HIS
LINEUP
TO
GET
THE
JOB
DONE
HIS
ABILITY
TO
THROW
OUT
NEW
LOOKS
AND
STRATEGIES
AT
A
MOMENTS
NOTICE
IS
INCREDIBLE
BOWMAN
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
A
TERRIFIC
ABILITY
OF
READING
HIS
PLAYERS
ON
AN
INDIVIDUAL
BASIS
LAST
NIGHT
FOR
INSTANCE
HE
REALIZED
THAT
THE
SPEED
OF
JAGR
STRAKA
AND
MACEACHERN
WAS
THROWING
THE
DEVILS
OFF
BALANCE
AS
A
RESULT
STRAKA
RECEIVED
MANY
MORE
SHIFTS
THAN
AVERAGE
JAGR
PLAYED
ALMOST
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
HE
WAS
ALWAYS
ON
THE
PUCK
AND
MACEACHERN
SCORED
A
GOAL
WHILE
COMPLEMENTING
JAGR
MANY
TIMES
THROUGHOUT
THE
NIGHT
HIS
ABILITY
TO
COMMIT
TO
ONE
PLAYER
IN
CRUCIAL
SITUATIONS
IS
COMMENDABLE
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
A
COACH
OF
SUCH
A
TALENTED
TEAM
MIGHT
SIMPLY
RELY
ON
THE
OVERALL
TALENT
TO
DOMINATE
AND
TO
BRING
ABOUT
SUCCESS
WHILE
NO
ONE
CAN
REPLACE
THE
GENIUS
AND
OPTIMISM
OF
BADGER
BOB
JOHNSON
BOWMAN
IN
HIS
OWN
WAY
HAS
MADE
HIMSELF
A
PERMANENT
THOUGH
NOT
CLEARLY
SEEN
MARK
IN
PITTSBURGH
