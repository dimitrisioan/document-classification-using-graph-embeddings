BRAD
GIBSON
WRITES
IN
RESPONSE
TO
A
DEBATE
ABOUT
WHO
HAS
HAS
A
BETTER
SEASON
JAGR
OF
FRANCIS
I
THINK
JAGR
DID
HE
PROBABLY
HAD
A
BETTER
POINT
PER
MINUTE
ICE
TIME
STATS
DONT
EXIST
TO
PROPERLY
ANALYZE
THIS
AND
HE
HAD
A
SUBSTANCIALLY
BETTER
ACTUALLY
WHAT
I
THINK
HAS
BECOME
MORE
EVIDENT
IS
THAT
YOU
ARE
DETERMINED
TO
FLAUNT
YOUR
IGNORANCE
AT
ALL
COST
JAGR
DID
NOT
HAVE
A
BETTER
SEASON
THAN
FRANCIS
TO
SUGGEST
OTHERWISE
IS
AN
INSULT
TO
THOSE
WITH
A
MODICUM
OF
HOCKEY
KNOWLEDGE
SAVE
YOUR
ALMOST
MANIACAL
DEVOTION
TO
THE
ALMIGHTY
PLUSMINUS
IT
IS
THE
MOST
MISLEADING
HOCKEY
STAT
AVAILABLE
UNTIL
THE
NHL
PUBLISHES
A
MORE
USEFUL
QUANTIFIABLE
STATISTIC
INCLUDING
ICE
TIME
PER
GAME
AND
SOME
MEASURE
OF
ITS
QUALITY
IE
IS
THE
PLAYER
PUT
OUT
IN
KEY
SITUATIONS
LIKE
PROTECTING
A
LEAD
LATE
IN
THE
GAME
IS
HE
MATCHED
UP
AGAINST
THE
OTHER
TEAMS
TOP
ONE
OR
TWO
LINES
SHORTHANDED
ETC
I
WOULD
MUCH
RATHER
SEE
THE
DISAPPEAR
ALTOGETHER
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
ITS
DUBIOUS
MERITS
TRUMPETED
BY
THOSE
WITH
LITTLE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
ITS
IMPLICATIONS
IS
A
USEFUL
STATISTIC
IF
A
PLAYER
IS
ON
THE
ICE
WHEN
HIS
TEAM
SCORES
A
LOT
OF
GOALS
AND
ONLY
ALLOWS
A
FEW
GOALS
HE
MUST
BE
DOING
SOMETHING
RIGHT
IT
IS
ESPECIALLY
USEFUL
TO
COMPARE
BETWEEN
TEAMMATES
AS
THEY
PLAY
FOR
THE
SAME
TEAM
AND
SHOULD
HAVE
ROUGHLY
SIMILAR
RATINGS
IF
THEY
ARE
EQUALLY
GOOD
PLAYERS
IT
CAN
BE
ADJUSTED
WITH
VARYING
DEGREES
OF
SUCCESS
TO
COMPARE
BETWEEN
PLAYERS
ON
DIFFERENT
TEAMS
I
AGREE
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
FOR
THE
NHL
TO
KEEP
MORE
STATISTICS
BUT
HOW
USEFUL
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
YOU
SUGGEST
TOTAL
ICE
TIME
WOULD
BE
VERY
USEFUL
IT
IS
A
MISSING
STAT
IN
JAGR
VS
FRANCIS
ARGUMENTS
FROM
BEFORE
SOMEHOW
MEASURING
THE
QUALITY
OF
ICE
TIME
AS
YOU
SUGGEST
WOULD
BE
USELESS
IT
WOULD
BE
A
BETTER
STAT
FOR
EVALUATING
COACHING
IE
ARE
THE
PLAYERS
GIVEN
QUALITY
ICE
TIME
ACTUALLY
THEIR
TALENTED
ONES
A
VERY
GOOD
PLAYER
COULD
BE
GIVEN
LOW
AMOUNTS
OF
QUALITY
ICE
TIME
BECAUSE
OF
TEAM
DEPTH
OR
A
STUPID
COACH
WHO
DOESNT
RECOGNIZE
HIS
TALENT
AND
A
VERY
BAD
PLAYER
COULD
BE
GIVEN
LOTS
OF
QUALITY
ICE
TIME
BECAUSE
OF
A
LACK
OF
TEAM
DEPTH
OR
A
STUPID
COACH
THAT
THINKS
HE
IS
AN
EFFECTIVE
PLAYER
THIS
STAT
WOULD
BE
MUCH
MORE
FLAWED
THAN
AND
ALMOST
NO
CONCLUSIONS
COULD
BE
DRAWN
REGARDING
PLAYER
TALENT
IS
A
USEFUL
STAT
IT
IS
QUITE
USEFUL
IN
EVALUATING
PLAYER
TALENT
YOU
ARE
THE
ONE
DISPLAYING
IGNORANCE
BECAUSE
OF
YOUR
UNWILLINGNESS
TO
SEE
THAT
BEING
ON
THE
ICE
WHEN
GOALS
ARE
SCORED
BUT
NOT
WHEN
THEY
ARE
ALLOWED
IS
A
VERY
POSITIVE
THING
AND
SHOULD
BE
EVALUATED
AS
SUCH
GREGMEISTER
