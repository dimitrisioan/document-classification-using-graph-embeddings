MARCUS
LINDROOS
INF
WRITES
NOT
TOO
LOW
PERHAPS
BUT
SURELY
NOT
AS
HIGH
AS
THAT
OF
AN
EUROPEAN
NHL
DIVISION
THE
FINNISH
TEAM
FOR
EXAMPLE
WOULD
CONTAIN
ALL
PLAYERS
CURRENTLY
ON
THE
NATIONAL
TEAM
PLUS
A
TOPCLASS
FOREIGNER
OR
TWO
THEY
WOULD
BE
IN
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
LEAGUE
THAN
TPS
OR
JOKERIT
BOTH
OF
WHOM
HAVE
PERHAPS
A
DOZEN
PLAYERS
OF
INTERNATIONAL
CLASS
IF
EVEN
THAT
WHY
SETTLE
FOR
A
MINOR
LEAGUE
WHEN
YOU
COULD
HAVE
THE
BEST
IT
IS
NO
MATTER
WHAT
YOU
CALL
THE
TEAMS
JOKERIT
AND
TPS
OR
HELSINKI
TORNADO
AND
TURKU
TYPHOON
THE
BEST
PALYERS
IN
FINLAND
WOULD
EVENTUALLY
END
UP
IN
THOSE
TEAMS
ANYWAY
IF
THEY
WERE
IN
THE
BIG
LEAGUE
ID
RATHER
SPEND
MARKS
TO
WATCH
THE
HELSINKI
TORNADO
PLAY
MONTREAL
THE
NY
RANGERS
OR
LOS
ANGELES
THAN
MARKS
FOR
THE
PRIVILEGE
TO
SEE
JOKERIT
VS
JYPHT
OR
EVEN
DJURGARDENS
IF
THERES
NOTHING
LIKE
THE
NHL
PERIOD
UNREALISTIC
FOR
NOW
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
FIRST
JUST
EXPAND
FINNISH
LEAGUE
TO
ALLOW
TEAMS
FROM
BALTIC
COUNTRIES
TO
ENTRY
THEN
OTHERS
WILL
GET
INTERESTED
IN
THE
IDEA
THAT
MAYBE
ONE
SHOULD
SETTLE
SOMETHING
BIGGER
THE
ULTIMATE
GOAL
AS
YOU
WANT
IT
WOULD
BE
EUROPEAN
DIVISION
IN
NHL
BTW
DOES
THAT
MAKE
A
FINAL
WITH
AN
EUROPAN
TEAM
AGAINST
NORHT
AMERICAN
