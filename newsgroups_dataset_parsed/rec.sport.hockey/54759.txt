VS
VANCOUVER
IN
ARTICLE
DARYL
TURNER
WRITES
OH
YEAHAND
I
CAN
GO
TO
THE
ARENA
AND
SEE
NOT
ONE
NOT
TWO
BUT
SIX
CHAMPIONSHIP
BANNERS
HANGING
FROM
THE
RAFTERS
STANLEY
CUP
BANNERS
AND
AVCO
CUP
BANNERS
MY
NHL
GUIDE
SAYS
THAT
VANCOUVER
HAS
WON
THE
CUP
ONCE
AS
MANY
TIMES
AS
THE
ROCKIN
TOWN
OF
KENORA
HAS
WON
IT
DONT
LET
THIS
CONFUSE
ANYBODY
THE
WINNIPEG
JETS
HAVE
NEVER
WON
THE
STANLEY
CUP
OR
EVEN
COME
THAT
CLOSE
THESE
STANLEY
CUP
CHAMPIONSHIPS
GO
BACK
A
LONG
WAY
TO
ABOUT
THE
TURN
OF
THE
CENTURY
THE
WINNIPEG
VICTORIAS
WON
ONE
OR
MORE
OF
THESE
CUPS
THE
JETS
DIDNT
WIN
ANY
OF
THEM
CAN
YOU
THINK
OF
ANYTHING
MORE
IRRELEVANT
TO
ARGUE
ABOUT
A
PLAYOFF
SERIES
GOING
ON
TODAY
THAN
WHO
WON
MORE
STANLEY
CUPS
AROUND
THE
TURN
OF
THE
CENTURY
LETS
FACE
FACTS
THE
CANUCKS
ARE
LEADING
THE
SERIES
THE
CANUCKS
DOMINATED
THE
JETS
IN
THEIR
SEASON
SERIES
THE
CANUCKS
DID
BETTER
IN
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
THAN
WINNIPEG
WHO
IS
THE
BETTER
TEAM
I
THINK
THAT
THE
FACTS
SHOW
THAT
VANCOUVER
IS
BETTER
THAN
WINNIPEG
