STEVE
GALLICHIO
WRITES
I
STILL
AM
SURPRISED
THAT
NO
ONE
HAS
TRIED
GIVING
AWAY
THE
GOODIES
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
GAME
THE
TWO
PROBLEMS
WITH
THAT
OF
COURSE
ARE
THAT
YOU
WOULD
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THE
FIRST
PEOPLE
IN
THE
BUILDING
WOULD
BE
ASSURED
OF
GETTING
THEM
PROBABLY
REDEEMABLE
VOUCHERS
AND
THAT
THE
BUILDING
MANAGERS
WANT
TO
AVOID
AT
ALL
COSTS
DELAYING
PEOPLE
AS
THEY
LEAVE
THE
BUILDING
IF
FOR
INSTANCE
THE
GOODIES
ARE
GIVEN
TO
PEOPLE
AS
THEY
EXIT
I
WENT
TO
THE
NEW
JERSEY
DEVILSCARVEL
ICE
CREAM
PUCK
NIGHT
TM
LAST
YEAR
TO
SEE
THE
BELOVED
BRUINS
PLAY
THE
PUCKS
WERE
GIVEN
OUT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
GAME
I
COULD
JUST
IMAGINE
WHAT
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
LATE
IN
THE
THIRD
IF
THE
BRUINS
WERE
WINNING
IT
FIGURES
AFTER
I
POSTED
THE
FIRST
ARTICLE
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
THE
WHALERS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
USING
COUPONS
FOR
THE
THE
GIVEAWAY
ON
FRIDAY
NIGHT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IS
IS
THE
SOME
BIG
CORPORATION
PROBABLY
A
BANK
FLYING
DISK
NIGHT
I
THINK
THAT
WE
COULD
ALL
SEE
THE
POTENTIAL
FOR
DANGER
HERE
ALL
IN
ALL
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
WHOLE
BUNCH
OF
GIVEAWAYS
LAND
ON
THE
ICE
AND
IT
NEVER
CEASES
TO
AMUSE
ME
IM
JUST
THANKFUL
FOR
THE
PLAYERS
THAT
NO
ONE
HAS
YET
TO
SPONSOR
LEAD
PIPE
NIGHT
AT
ANY
ARENAS
THATS
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
THEY
COULDNT
FIND
ANYONE
TO
SPONSER
IT
MAYBE
USS
COULD
SPONSER
THE
PITTSBURGH
PENGUINSUS
STEEL
STEEL
ROD
NIGHT
CLOSE
ENOUGH
NAAH
ITD
PROBABLY
BOUNCE
OFF
OF
JAY
CAUFIELD
SG
I
WAS
AT
A
CINCINNATI
CYCLONES
GAME
A
YEAR
AGO
WHEN
THE
LOCAL
COUNTRY
STATION
SPONSORED
A
KAZOO
GIVEAWAY
AFTER
A
PARTICULARLY
BAD
CALL
BY
THE
UNDEREXPERIENCED
ECHL
REF
IT
WAS
KAZOOSTORM
TIME
DOWN
ON
THE
ICE
I
THOUGHT
THIS
WAS
A
PATHETIC
DISPLAY
BY
THE
FANS
BUT
THEY
WERE
RIGHTFULLY
UNHAPPY
