THE

IN
THEIR

IN
OURS
DON
THEN
BEGAN
TO
PRAISE
GILMOUR
AGAIN
DON
POINTED
OUT
THAT
GILMOUR
HAS
NEVER
GOT
LESS
THAN
POINTS
OR
A
GOAL
IN
ANY
GAME
SINCE
HE
GOT
POINTS
IN
A
GAME
AGAINST
ST
LOUIS
DON
ALSO
CLAIMS
THAT
HE
GAVE
A
LOT
OF
ENCOURAGEMENT
TO
GILMOUR
WHICH
WAS
PARTLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
HIS
GOOD
PLAY
SEVERAL
CLIPS
WERE
THEN
SHOWN
OF
GILMOUR
FROM
THE
SERIES
A
HIT
ON
CONSTANTINOV
AND
A
PASS
TO
ANDREWCHUK
RESULTING
IN
A

ON
THE

ITSELF
THE
WINGS
WERE
TAKING
A

BROUGHT
UP
THE
PREVIOUS
QUEBECMONTREAL
GAME
NOTE
MONTREAL
WON
THAT
GAME
IN
OVERTIME
DESPITE
HAVING
A
POSSIBLE
GAME
WINNER
DISQUALIFIED
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
BATTED
IN
WITH
A
HIGH
STICK
DON
THOUGHT
THE
HIGH
STICK
WAS
OBVIOUS
EVEN
WITHOUT
THE
USE
OF

REPLAY
ON
THE
BUFFALOBOSTON

BUFFALO
IS

HIS
PERFORMANCE
DURING
THE
DETROITTORONTO

DON
DEFENDED
HIM
BY
SAYING
THAT

CANT
PLAY
THE
WAY
HE
SHOULD
BECAUSE
OF
THE
LEAGUES
NEW

THIS
USED
TO
BE
A
ROUGH

MURRAY

CLAIMING
THE
ELIMINATION

INCREASES
STICKWORK
DON
ALSO
READ
A
NEWSPAPER
ARTICLE
IN
WHICH
MURRAY
MAKES
THE
FOLLOWING
STATEMENTS
PLAYERS
DONT
FIGHT
BECAUSE
THEYRE
AFRAID
OF
GETTING
THROWN
OUT
OF
THE
GAME
AS
INSTIGATOR
INSTEAD
THEY
SETTLE
GRUDGES
BY
GETTING
THEIR
STICKS
AND
SLICING
EACH
OTHER
IS
THIS
WHAT
THE
FANS
WANT
TO
SEE
I
GUARANTEE
THERE
WOULDNT
BE
AS
MANY
SLASHES
IF
