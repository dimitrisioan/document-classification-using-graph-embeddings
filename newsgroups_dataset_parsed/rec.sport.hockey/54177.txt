espn
fck
up
okay
heres
some
gripeing
griping
whatever
i
live
in
santa
barbara
for
reference
i
think
okay
abc
showed
the
kingsflames
fine
yawn
espn
through
a
fortunate
rainout
of
a
baseball
game
showed
the
red
wingstoronto
game
cool
but
i
swear
that
the
advertisements
all
week
long
had
said
that
espn
would
show
pittnj
on
tuesday
and
bosbuff
on
thursday
i
raced
home
from
work
early
pacific
to
catch
the
game
but
alas
it
was
the
bostonbuffalo
game
and
then
they
promised
that
they
would
show
the
pittnj
game
on
thursday
overnight
they
changed
their
mind
i
didnt
mind
that
much
i
watched
the
game
hockey
is
much
better
than
no
hockey
during
the
game
their
were
no
video
highlights
from
the
patrick
division
what
the
hell
was
going
on
at
least
they
should
show
video
highlights
of
the
other
games
especially
the
nyicaps
game
that
was
so
close
my
father
lives
in
bowling
green
kentucky
bumbfck
egypt
got
to
watch
the
pens
game
on
espn
i
just
dont
get
it
the
biggest
problem
is
that
buffalo
or
boston
fans
who
didnt
want
to
see
the
pittsburghnew
jersey
game
will
turn
on
their
tvs
on
thursday
and
see
the
pittsburghnew
jersey
game
instead
of
the
buffaloboston
game
at
least
in
my
case
i
just
had
to
wait
more
days
to
see
my
game
if
i
were
a
big
boston
or
buffalo
fan
and
i
missed
the
game
on
tuesday
due
to
false
advertising
on
the
part
of
espn
id
be
mad
as
hell
oh
well
hopefully
well
get
better
coverage
next
year
or
something
matt
coohill
ps
the
announcers
for
the
buffaloboston
were
the
worst
that
i
have
ever
heard
as
far
emotion
goes
they
had
the
enthusiasm
of
droopy
dog
i
hope
for
better
on
thursday
