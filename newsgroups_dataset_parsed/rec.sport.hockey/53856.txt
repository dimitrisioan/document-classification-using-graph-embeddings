i
dont
see
why
more
people
dont
blame
grant
fuhr
for
the
goal
that
smith
put
in
his
own
net
its
common
to
play
the
puck
back
to
your
own
goalie
when
deep
in
your
own
end
and
under
little
or
no
pressure
from
the
offensive
team
if
fuhr
had
been
in
position
the
puck
would
have
never
crossed
the
line

am
not
sure

this
