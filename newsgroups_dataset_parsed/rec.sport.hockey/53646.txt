ATLANTA
HOCKEY
HELL
WELL
ITS
NOT
THAT
BAD
BUT
I
AM
STILL
PRETTY
PISSED
OF
AT
THE
LOCAL
ABC
COVERAGE
THEY
CUT
OFF
THE
FIRST
HALF
HOUR
OF
COVERAGE
BY
PLAYING
DAVID
BRINKLEY
AT
INSTEAD
OF
AN
EARLIER
TIME
SLOT
I
DONT
EVEN
UNDERSTAND
THEIR
PROBLEM
IF
THEY
DIDNT
THINK
ENOUGH
PEOPLE
WOULD
NOT
WATCH
THE
GAME
WHY
WOULD
THEY
DECIDE
TO
SHOW
MOST
OF
THE
GAME
AND
IF
THEY
SHOWED
THE
REMAINING
HOURS
OF
THE
GAME
WOULD
IT
HURT
TO
PLAY
DAVID
BRINKLEY
AT
ITS
REGULAR
TIME
THEY
DONT
HAVE
ANY
DECENT
PROGRAMMING
BEFORE
NOON
ANYWAY
I
CALLED
THE
SPORTS
DEPT
AND
BLASTED
THEM
ON
THEIR
MACHINE
I
CALLED
GAIN
AND
SOMEONE
PICKED
IT
UP
WHEN
I
ASKED
HIM
WHY
THEY
PREMEPTED
THE
FIRST
HALF
HOUR
OF
THE
STANLEY
CUP
PLAYOFFS
HE
SEEMED
A
BIT
CONFUSED
WHEN
I
EXPLAINED
A
BIT
MORE
IN
DETAIL
HE
THEN
SAID
THATS
UPTO
TO
OUR
PROGRAMMING
DEPT
CALL
BACK
ON
MONDAY
WEEL
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
SPORTS
DEPT
IS
NOT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THIS
PREEMPTION
BUT
I
CANT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
SOMEONE
IN
THE
SPORTS
DEPT
CANT
EVEN
RECOGNISE
THE
NAME
OF
PLAYOFFS
SHOWN
ON
THE
VERY
SAME
STATION
HE
WORKS
FOR
ANYWAY
I
AM
GOING
TO
CALL
THEM
TOMORROW
AND
BLAST
THEM
ON
THE
PHONE
AGAIN
I
URGE
ALL
ATLANTA
HOCKEY
FANS
TO
CALL
WSB
AND
ASK
THEM
NOT
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THING
FOR
THE
NEXT
WEEKS
PRAVIN
RATNAMOH
BY
THE
WAY
PENS
RULE
