tonight
in
boston
looks
like
boston
can
hang
this
season
up
because
buffalos
home
record
is
awesome
this
is
great
buffalo
fans
might
get
to
see
revenge
for
last
year
im
glad
grant
fuhr
will
never
be
as
overconfident
after
two
wins
as
you
areit
takes
four
wins
to
defeat
an
opponenteach
tougher
to
obtain
than
the
previous
one
buffalo
is
off
to
a
good
start
fuhr
is
proving
the
fuhrbashers
wrong
but
boston
is
an
awfully
good
team
gerald
awesome
home
record
or
not
you
need
to

like
to
see
some
playoff
games

im
stuck
in
buffalo
at
ub
but
i
think
boston
isnt
giving
up
so
easy
