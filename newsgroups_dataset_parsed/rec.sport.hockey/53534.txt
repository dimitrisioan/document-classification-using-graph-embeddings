RE
WHATS
SO
BAD
ABOUT
THE
NEW
PLAYOFF
FORMAT
IN
ARTICLE
ICOPCSABUEDU
ANTONIO
PERA
WRITES
WHATS
SO
BAD
ABOUT
THE
NEW
PLAYOFF
FORMAT
DO
YOU
REALLY
BELIEVE
TEAMS
THAT
FINISH
FOURTH
IN
THEIR
DIV
DESERVE
TO
BE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
WITH
THE
NEW
FORMAT
YOU
HAVE
MORE
OF
A
CHANCE
TO
SEE
MORE
TEAMS
DO
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TO
SEE
THE
BRUINS
AGAINST
THE
SABRES
UMPTEEN
TIMES
OR
WOULD
YOU
RATHER
SEE
THE
BRUINS
AND
THE
CAPITALS
IN
THE
SECOUND
ROUND
OF
PLAYOFFS
THERE
IS
REALLY
NOTHING
INHERENTLY
WRONG
WITH
IT
BUT
THEY
TRIED
IT
JUST
A
LITTLE
OVER
A
DECADE
AGO
AND
NOONE
SHOWED
UP
FOR
THE
EARLY
ROUNDS
IN
THE
PLAYOFFSWHEREAS
SOON
AFTER
THEY
WENT
TO
THE
DIVISIONAL
SETUP
ARENAS
WERE
MOSTLY
FILLED
IN
THE
EARLY
ROUNDS
THE
EMPIRICAL
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
LAST
TWO
DECADES
IS
THAT
MORE
PEOPLE
WILL
SHOW
UP
TO
SEE
THE
BRUINS
PLAY
THE
SABRE
UMPTEEN
TIMES
THAN
SEE
THE
BRUINS
PLAY
THE
CAPTIALS
IN
THE
FIRST
ROUND
MAYBE
HOCKEY
HAS
INCREASED
IN
POPULARITY
SUFFICIENTLY
THAT
THIS
WILL
NO
LONGER
BE
THE
CASE
THE
EXPERIMENT
IS
WORTHWHILE
WITH
THE
UNEVEN
DISTRIBUTION
OF
THE
EXPANSION
TEAMS
BUT
I
PREFER
THE
DIVISIONAL
PLAYOFF
GERALD
