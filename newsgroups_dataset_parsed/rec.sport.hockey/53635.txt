NO
I
WOULD
NOT
WANT
TO
SEE
A
BALLARD
DIVISION
BUT
TO
SAY
THAT
THESE
OWNERS
ARE
ASSHOLES
HENCE
ALL
NHL
MANAGEMENT
PEOPLE
ARE
ASSHOLES
WOULD
BE
FALLACIOUS
CONN
SMYTHE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WAS
A
CLASSY
INDIVIDUAL
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
HEARD
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
CLASSY
FROM
WHAT
IVE
HEARD
ABOUT
HIM
HE
WAS
ABOUT
AS
CLASSY
AS
HAROLD
BALLARD
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
WAS
THAT
BACK
THEN
ALMOST
ALL
THE
OWNERS
WERE
LIKE
THAT
SO
HE
SEEMED
OKAY
BY
COMPARISON
READ
THE
BOOK
NET
WORTH
FOR
ONE
VIEW
OF
WHAT
SMYTHE
AND
NORRIS
AND
ADAMS
AND
CAMPBELL
WERE
LIKE
ALSO
ISNT
THE
POINT
OF
PROFESSIONAL
HOCKEY
TO
MAKE
MONEY
FOR
ALL
THOSE
INVOLVED
WHICH
WOULD
INCLUDE
THE
PLAYERS
WHAT
I
THINK
YOU
MIGHT
BE
SAYING
IS
THAT
THE
PLAYERS
HAVE
NOT
MADE
AS
MUCH
MONEY
AS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THEIR
DUE
AND
IT
IS
THE
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
WHAT
MAKE
THE
GAME
GREAT
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
PUT
THEM
ON
THE
ICE
SO
NAMING
DIVISION
AFTER
MANAGEMENT
PEOPLE
RATHER
THAN
PLAYERS
IS
ADDING
INSULT
IN
THE
FORM
OF
LESSER
RECOGNITION
TO
INJURY
LESS
MONEY
THAN
WAS
DESERVED
EVEN
MORE
SPECIFICALLY
I
THINK
WHAT
ROGER
WAS
SAYING
AND
I
SAID
IT
PREVIOUSLY
TOO
IS
THAT
THESE
ARE
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
MADE
THE
LEAGUE
GREAT
SO
WHY
SHOULD
DIVISIONS
CONFERENCES
ETC
BE
NAMED
AFTER
THEM
INSTEAD
OF
MORENZ
VEZINA
HOWE
ORR
ETC
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DID
MAKE
IT
GREAT
INSTEAD
THE
NHL
HAS
CHOSEN
TO
IMMORTALIZE
THE
MEN
WHO
GOT
RICH
OFF
OF
THE
MEN
WHO
MADE
THE
GAME
GREAT
