WRITES
ESPN
IS
PATHETIC
I
HAVE
BEEN
WATCHING
EVERYBODY
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
ESPNS
COVERAGE
AND
I
AGREE
WITH
ALL
OF
YOU
MIGHT
I
SUGGEST
THAT
WE
ARE
GETTING
ALL
WORKED
UP
OVER
NOTHING
WE
ALL
KNEW
THAT
ESPNS
COVERAGE
WAS
GOING
TO
SUCK
I
MEAN
HAVE
YOU
EVER
WATCHED
DURING
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
SPORTSCENTER
COVERAGE
OF
HOCKEY
IT
SUCKS
I
MEAN
REALLY
SUCKS
ESPN
DOES
NOT
KNOW
HOCKEY
IF
IT
SHOT
THEM
IN
THE
ASS
I
WAS
REALLY
PISSED
OF
ABOUT
LAST
NIGHT
COVERAGE
I
GO
TO
SCHOOL
IN
OHIO
I
KNOW
THE
INDIANS
SUCK
SO
WHY
SHOW
THEM
IF
I
WERE
BILL
CLEMENT
I
WOULD
SHOOT
MYSELF
ANYWAY
AFTER
I
CALMED
DOWN
AFTER
I
REALIZED
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
GOING
TO
SHOW
OVERTIME
OF
THE
CAPS
ISLES
GAME
I
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF
I
KNEW
THAT
THIS
WAS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
IN
FACT
I
REMERBED
MYSELF
PRAYING
THAT
AT
LEAST
THEY
WOULD
KEEP
EVEN
THE
BORING
DEVILS
GAME
OVERALL
I
THINK
ESPN
DOES
NOT
CARE
IF
THEY
SHOW
HOCKEY
OR
NOT
AND
I
FIRMLY
BELIVE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
KNOW
RESPECT
FOR
THE
FANS
IE
BECAUSE
OF
CONTRACT
OBLIGATIONS
SCREW
YOU
ESPN
PRAISE
BE
TO
ALL
HOCKEY
FANS
WHO
PUT
UP
WITH
THIS
SHIT
GO
HAWKS
THIS
IS
THE
PRICE
HOCKEY
FANS
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
MISTAKE
OF
LEAVING
ESPN
OR
YEARS
AGOIT
WILL
TAKE
TIME
TO
CORRECT
FOR
THAT
MISTAKE
BUT
RETURNING
TO
ESPN
WAS
THE
CORRECT
DECISION
LAST
YEARBY
NEXT
TIME
WE
MAY
HAVE
THE
POTENTIAL
FOR
SPORTSCHANNEL
AND
ESPN
TO
REALLY
COMPETE
TO
OFFER
BETTER
COVERAGE
AND
BE
FORCED
TO
DELIVER
ON
IT
