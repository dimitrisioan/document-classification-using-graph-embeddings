says
id
like
to
echo
these
sentiments
this
is
the
worst
coverage
i
can
ever
remember
seeing
on
cbc
as
soon
as
the
game
ends
i
can
count
to
and
by
that
time
theyve
signed
off
the
air
no
post
game
interviews
no
updating
of
late
scores
nothin
tsn
is
really
putting
cbc
to
shame
i
only
hope
the
later
round
coverage
improves
i
mean
who
really
wants
to
see
cbc
primetime
news
instead
of
hockey
my
darren
this
was
a
concession
to
mansbridge
and
cbc
news
they
argued
that
if
youre
going
to
play
havoc
with
the
schedule
you
should
at
least
make
sure
that
prime
time
is
aired
as
soon
as
possible
news
got
a
commitment
that
the
postgame
show
would
be
scrapped
and
that
the
network
would
go
to
ptn
within
one
minute
or
so
of
the
game
ending
as
for
the
earlier
comments
about
cbc
being
ontariocentric
frankly
the
no
doubleheader
decison
goes
both
ways
people
in
the
west
cant
see
the
leafs
and
people
in
central
canada
cant
see
the
jets
game
the
reason
for
the
decision
was
cbcs
feeling
they
couldnt
sell
advertising
for
six
hours
of
hockey
in
one
night
as
for
who
wants
to
see
news
over
hockey
a
lot
of
people
cbc
always
gets
plenty
of
complaints
about
juggling
the
news
