GREG
ROGERS
WRITES
HI
ALL
DUE
TO
LIVING
IN
THE
BAY
AREA
I
AS
UNABLE
TO
SEE
VANCOUVERS
VICTORY
OVER
THE
JETS
LAST
NIGHT
I
KNOW
THE
SCORE
BUT
THAT
RARELY
DESCRIBES
THE
GAME
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
POST
A
BRIEF
SONAPSIS
SP
OF
WAHT
HAPPENED
HOW
WELL
DID
EACH
TEAM
PLAY
WERE
THE
CANNUCKS
DESERVING
OF
THE
VICTORY
WELL
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
CANUCKS
PLAYED
A
REALLY
STRONG
GAME
I
WAS
ESPECIALLY
PLEASED
BY
A
VERY
STRONG
GAME
FROM
LINDEN
I
THINK
HE
COULD
BE
A
KEY
TO
SUCCESS
FOR
THEM
THIS
YEAR
DEFENSIVELY
THEY
REALLY
HAD
A
STRONG
GAME
HARDLY
HEARD
SELANNES
NAME
ALL
NIGHT
CRAVEN
ALSO
PLAYED
ONE
OF
HIS
BEST
GAMES
SINCE
COMING
OVER
WITH
A
FEW
EXCEPTIONS
THEY
REALLY
DIDNT
LET
THE
HIGHFLYING
JETS
DO
MUCH
HIGHFLYING
I
THOUGHT
THE
JETS
DEFENCE
LOOKED
OVERMATCHED
BY
THE
CANUCKS
FORWARDS
THEY
WILL
HAVE
TO
IMPROVE
ON
THAT
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
MAKE
THIS
A
SERIES
IN
SHORT
IT
WAS
A
GREAT
START
