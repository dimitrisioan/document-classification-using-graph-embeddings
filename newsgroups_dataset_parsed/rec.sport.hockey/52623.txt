ten

the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
from
where
i
come
from
in
canada
borshevsky
sounds
more
canadian
than
smith
anyways
crawl
back
into
the
hole
you
crawled
out
ofthe
nba
doesnt
care
where
they
get
basketball
players
from
major
league
baseball
doesnt
give
a
damn
where
they
get
baseball
players
from
except
cuba
that
is
canada
is
in
no
imminent
danger
of
being
overtaken
as
the
primary
supplier
of
playerssweden
finland
the
czech
republic
and
slovakia
are
all
relatively
small
countries
and
cannot
really
produce
players
at
a
greater
rate
than
they
are
already
producing
them
and
the
potential
influx
from
the
former
soviet
union
is
severely
blunted
because
the
system
has
been
raided
and
is
starved
for
finances
and
will
take
a
decade
or
two
to
recover
and
become
a
real
threat
and
the
us
will
just
maintain
its
slow
increase
canada
should
continue
to
supply
plus
of
the
top
hockey
players
in
the
world
for
the
forseeable
future
besides
we
need
the
european
hockey
market
if
hockey
is
to
take
its
rightful
place
besides
soccer
as
the
two
predominant
world
sportsand
since
soccer
is
essentially
boring
unlike
hockey
i
live
in
vancouver
and
if
i
hear
one
more
word
about
pavel
bure
the
russian
rocket
i
will
completely
throw
up
as
it
is
now
every
time
i
see
the
canucks
play
i
keep
hoping
someone
will
crosscheck
bure
into
the
plexiglassso
hard
they
have
to
carry
him
out
on
a
stretcher
by
the
way
im
not
a
canucks
fan
to
begin
with
okay
the
stretcher
remark
was
a
little
carried
away
but
the
point
is
that
i
resent
nhl
owners
drafting
all
these
europeans
instead
of
canadians
and
some
americans
it
denies
young
canadians
the
opportunity
to
play
in
their
north
american
league
and
instead
gives
it
to
europeans
who
arent
even
better
hockey
players
its
all
hype
this
european
mystique
is
sickening
but
until
nhl
owners
get
over
it
canadian
and
american
players
will
continue
to
have
to
fight
harder
to
get
drafted
into
their
own
league
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
canadians
are
under
no
threatthe
european
numbers
will
soon
saturate
if
they
havent
alreadyand
by
the
time
russia
comes
online
again
the
nhl
should
be
a
world
league
and
there
will
be
many
more
teams
to
stock
and
many
more
jobs
for
canadian
hockey
players
in
the
near
team
the
percentage
of
canadians
will
mostly
decline
because
of
americans
not
because
of
europeans
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
i
just
dont
want
them
on
mine
crawl
into
a
hole
and
die
gerald
