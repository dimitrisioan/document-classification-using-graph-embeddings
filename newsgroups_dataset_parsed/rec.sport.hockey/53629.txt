are
people
here
stupid
or
what
it
is
a
tie
breaker
of
cause
they
have
to
have
the
same
record
how
can
people
be
sooooo
stuppid
to
put
win
as
first
in
the
list
for
tie
breaker
if
it
is
a
tie
breaker
how
can
there
be
different
record
man
i
thought
people
in
this
net
are
good
with
hockey
i
might
not
be
great
in
math
but
tell
me
how
can
two
teams
ahve
the
same
points
with
different
record
manretard
cant
believe
people
actually
put
win
as
first
in
a
tie
breaker
why
not
i
believe
both
the
devils
and
islanders
got
points
say
for
example
another
team
had
this
record
they
had
which
is
the
same
as
their
points
total
the
islanders
and
devils
records
are
both
it
is
simple
arithmetics
and
involve
no
calculus
