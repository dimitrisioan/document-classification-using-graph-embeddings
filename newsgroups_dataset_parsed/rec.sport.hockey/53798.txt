BRYAN
MURRAY
HAS
DONE
VERY
LITTLE
AS
GMYZERMAN
FEDOROV
CHEVELDAE
CHAISSON
THE
WHOLE
RUSSIAN
STRATEGY
WAS
A
PRODUCT
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
GMMURRAY
HAS
MADE
A
COUPLE
OF
DECENT
TRADESTHATS
ABOUT
IT
THAT
WOULD
HARDLY
RANK
HIM
AS
THE
BEST
GM
THERE
ARE
MANY
TEAMS
IN
THE
NHL
WHO
HAVE
TAKEN
A
LIKING
TO
RUSSIAN
PLAYERS
THE
WHOLE
RUSSIAN
STRATEGY
IS
NOT
SPECIFIC
TO
DETROIT
OR
TO
DEVELLANO
WHO
WAS
GM
BEFORE
MURRAY
WHAT
THE
PREVIOUS
GM
ALSO
DID
WAS
TO
TRADE
AWAY
SEVERAL
PLAYERS
WHO
HAVE
GONE
ON
TO
DO
WELL
WITH
OTHER
TEAMS
MOST
NOTABLY
IN
MY
MEMORY
MURRAY
CRAVEN
WHO
HAD
A
FEW
VERY
GOOD
YEARS
WITH
PHILLY
AFTER
LEAVING
HERE
ALSO
ITS
NOT
THE
VOLUME
OF
TRADES
THAT
WILL
NECESSARILY
IMPROVE
A
TEAM
BUT
THE
QUALITY
OF
THEM
TRADING
ADAM
OATES
FOR
BERNIE
FEDERKO
WAS
JUST
PLAIN
STUPID
EVEN
IF
FEDERKO
USED
TO
BE
A
GREAT
PLAYER
AT
ONE
TIME
MOST
OF
MURRAYS
TRADES
HAVE
WORKED
SIGNIFICANTLY
TO
THE
WINGS
ADVANTAGE
WITH
THOSE
THAT
DIDNT
BEING
SOURED
MAINLY
BY
INJURY
TO
THE
PLAYERS
INVOLVED
SUCH
AS
TROY
CROWDER
WHO
SUFFERED
BACK
PROBLEMS
FROM
WHICH
HE
NEVER
REALLY
RECOVERED
DEVALLANO
WENT
EARLIER
AND
MORE
EXTENSIVELY
TO
THE
RUSSIAN
STRATEGY
THAN
ANYONE
ELSEAND
WAS
THE
FIRST
GM
TO
WASTE
HIGH
DRAFT
CHOICES
ON
YOUNG
RUSSIANSDEVALLANO
WOULD
STILL
BE
GM
BUT
HE
SUCCOMBED
TO
DEMERS
PLEADING
TO
MAKE
THE
OATESFEDERKO
ET
AL
TRADEWHICH
IS
THE
DEAL
THAT
SEALED
HIS
FATE
MURRAY
HAS
MADE
SOME
DECENT
TRADESNO
DOUBTBUT
THESE
ARE
MORE
DUE
TO
THE
STUPIDITY
OR
CHEAPNESS
OF
OTHER
TEAMS
THAN
BRILLIANCE
ON
HIS
PARTWASHINGTON
WAS
TOO
CHEAP
TO
PAY
CICCARELLI
SO
THEY
ESSENTIALLY
GAVE
HIM
AWAYAND
CARSON
WAS
REALLY
A
BIG
ANCHOR
TO
THE
TEAM
AND
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
SUCKER
A
ROOKIE
GM
TO
GIVE
HIM
PAUL
COFFEY
FOR
DEADWEIGHT
IF
DETROIT
STILL
FAILS
THIS
YEAR
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
ONE
DEFENSEMAN
SHORT
THEN
HE
WILL
HAVE
WASTED
AN
OPPORTUNITY
BECAUSE
MANSON
WAS
AVAILABLE
AND
HE
WAS
UNABLE
TO
PULL
THE
TRIGGER
IT
IS
HIS
JUDGEMENT
THAT
HE
HAS
ENOUGH
WITH
WHAT
HES
GOTYZERMAN
DOESNT
HAVE
THAT
MANY
MORE
