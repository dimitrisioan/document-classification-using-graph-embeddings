did
anyone
see
the
montreal
quebec
game
yesterday
it
was
tight
right
down
to
the
last
second
of
the
third
period
in
the
overtime
roy
and
hextall
played
like
they
were
gods
ok
so
montreal
won
they
deserved
it
after
getting
their
first
goal
in
overtime
waved
off
because
the
puck
was
hit
in
with
a
high
stick
their
second
goal
in
overtime
was
also
replayed
but
i
could
not
tell
if
it
was
the
montreal
player
who
kicked
it
in
the
puck
definitely
was
not
directed
in
by
a
stick
anyways
montreal
is
back
into
the
series
the
overhead
replay
pretty
clearly
showed
that
it
was
the
quebec
defender
who
deflected
the
puck
the
replay
officials
did
not
take
nearly
as
much
time
to
make
this
call
as
they
did
for
the
first
nongoal
so
it
seemed
pretty
noncontroversial
i
agree
that
it
was
a
great
game
good
to
see
roy
and
damphousse
back
into
form
hopefully
the
sign
of
good
things
to
come
