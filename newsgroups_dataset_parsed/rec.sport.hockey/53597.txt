REALLY
ANNOYING
TO
SEE
ALL
OF
THESE
C
PREDICTIONS
ON
THE
NET

REALLY
CARES
C
WHO
YOU

PLEASE
STOP
WITH
C
THE
PREDICTIONS
WE
ALL
KNOW
THE
CAPS
ARE
C
GOING
TO
WIN
THE
CUP
SO
LET
IT
GO
AT
THAT
C
HAA
THATS
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
I
FIND
MOST
INTERESTING
IN
THIS
NEWSGROUP
ITS
A
GOOD
WAY
OF
CLUING
INTO
THE
COLLECTIVE
WISDOM
OF
THE
AVERAGE
HOCKEY
FANS
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
THEYRE
ALWAYS
RIGHT
HOWEVER
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
HABS
ARE
GOING
TO
COME
OUT
OF
THE
ADAMS
AND
HARDLY
ANYONE
BELIEVES
THAT
RIGHT
NOW
JACK
ITS
HARD
TO
BE
HUMBLE
WHEN
YOURE
PERFECT
WELL
AS
LONG
AS
WERE
BEING
UNDULY
COCKY
HERE
ITS
OBVIOUS
THAT
THE
PENS
WILL
CONE
OUT
OF
THE
PATRICK
DIVISION
NOT
THE
CAPS
AND
ALSO
THAT
THEY
WILL
WIN
THIER
THIRD
STANLEY
CUP
COLLECTIVE
WISDOM
IS
A
VERY
POLITE
WAY
OF
PUTTING
IT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
ID
BE
SO
GRACIOUS
AND
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH
PROBABLY
NOT
MUCH
I
THINK
THE
HABS
WILL
COME
OUT
OF
THE
ADAMS
TOO
NOT
