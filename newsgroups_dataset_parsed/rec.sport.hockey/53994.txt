for
all

in
boston
i
thought

being
desperate
for
news
on
the
game
i
tried
to
get
wjr
am
on
my
walkman
and
succeeded
it
was
at
night
about
reception
got
better
as
it
got
you
can
get
wjr
a
long
way
away
the
problem
is
that
because
of
those
well
known
and
beloved
contractual
obligations
wjr
will
be
doing
tiger
baseball
instead
of
the
wings
playoff
games
for
probably
half
the
games
the
wings
could
play
for
this
series
i
know
tonights

and
i
believe

be
bumped

and
one
of
my
major
goals
is
to
leave
the
next
president
a
new
set
of
things
to
worry
about
im
getting
bored
reading
the
same
problems
in
the
paper
decade
after
decade
i
want
people
to
have
to
deal
with
new
problems
president
bill
clinton
