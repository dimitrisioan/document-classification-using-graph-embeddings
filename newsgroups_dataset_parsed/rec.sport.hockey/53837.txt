MINNESOTA
SCENE
TO
THOSE
WHO
ARE
WONDERING
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
IN
MINNESOTA
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
IN
THE
LOCAL
NEWS
TV
AND
NEWSPAPER
VARIOUS
PEOPLE
IN
THE
AREA
ARE
TRYING
TO
GET
A
NEW
HOCKEY
TEAM
A
COLUMNIST
FOR
THE
ST
PAUL
PIONEER
PRESS
WROTE
AN
ARTICLE
GIVING
THE
INSIDE
SCOOP
ON
THE
ISSUE
THERE
ARE
THREE
LOCAL
SITES
COMPETING
FOR
A
TEAM
AND
THREE
POSSIBLE
CANDIATES
TO
MOVE
TO
THE
TWIN
CITIES
FIRST
THE
SITES
TARGET
CENTER
CIVIC
CENTER
ST
PAUL
AND
YES
EVEN
THE
MET
CENTER
THE
COLUMNIST
WAS
PRETTY
CONFIDENT
THAT
MINNESOTA
WILL
GET
A
TEAM
AND
THAT
THE
TARGET
CENTER
WILL
ULTIMATELY
WIN
OUT
HE
ARGUED
HOWEVER
THAT
THE
COMPETITION
FROM
THE
OTHER
TWO
SITES
WILL
DELAY
THE
PROCESS
CONSIDERABLY
WITHOUT
THE
INTERSITE
COMPETITION
THE
COLUMNIST
SORRY
I
CANT
REMEMBER
HIS
NAME
BELIEVES
THAT
MINNESOTA
WOULD
HAVE
A
TEAM
BY
THE
SEASON
ALSO
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SITUATION
WITH
THE
TIMBERWOLVES
THINGS
WILL
BE
DELAYED
UNTIL
UNLESS
THE
CITY
OF
MINNEAPOLIS
TAKES
OVER
THE
TARGET
CENTER
HOWEVER
THEY
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
DO
SO
UNTIL
THE
MET
CENTER
IS
DESTROYED
BECAUSE
THE
CITY
WILL
LOSE
MONEY
IF
THERE
IS
COMPETITION
FROM
THE
MET
FOR
CONVENTIONS
AND
SHORTTERM
EVENTS
EVEN
WITH
HOCKEY
AT
TARGET
TO
ADD
TO
THIS
MESS
A
STUDY
TO
MONTHS
IS
GOING
TO
BE
CONDUCTED
ON
THE
FUTURE
VIABILITY
OF
THE
MET
CENTER
WHICH
OBVIOUSLY
DELAYS
THE
PROCESS
EVEN
FURTHER
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
STUDY
IS
CANCELLED
WHICH
WILL
HAVE
THE
EFFECT
OF
KNOCKING
THE
MET
CENTER
OUT
OF
THE
RUNNING
AND
PERHAPS
ENCOURAGING
MINNEAPOLIS
TO
TAKE
OVER
THE
TARGET
CENTER
SOONER
THE
CITY
WOULD
BE
BE
EVEN
MORE
ENCOURGED
IF
THE
WRECKING
BALL
IS
TAKEN
TO
THE
MET
WHICH
MAY
HAPPEN
REGARDING
POSSIBLE
CANDIDATES
THE
THREE
TEAMS
ARE
HARTFORD
TAMPA
BAY
AND
NEW
JERSEY
I
WOULD
PREFER
THE
DEVILS
MINNESOTA
ICE
DEMONS
ALTHOUGH
THE
LIGHTNING
MAY
HAVE
POTENTIAL
ALTHOUGH
IT
HASNT
BEEN
ANNOUNCED
YET
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
NEUTRAL
SITE
GAMES
WILL
BE
PLAYED
AT
THE
TARGET
CENTER
NEXT
YEAR
APPARENTLY
THE
DEVILS
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
PLAYING
IN
AS
MANY
OF
THOSE
SIX
GAMES
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
I
WOULDNT
BE
SURPRISED
TO
SEE
HARTFORD
AND
TAMPA
SHOW
UP
THERE
EITHER
SO
MINNESOTA
MAY
END
UP
GETTING
ANOTHER
TEAM
BUT
IT
MAY
TAKE
A
FEW
YEARS
GO
