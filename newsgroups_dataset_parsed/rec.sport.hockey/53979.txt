NHL
TEAM
IN
MILWAUKEE
AFTER
READING
SOME
OF
THE
REPORTS
OF
POSSIBLE
NHL
MOVES
TO
MILWAUKEE
OR
THAT
MILWAUKEE
SHOULD
HAVE
AN
NHL
TEAM
I
THOUGHT
ID
PASS
ALONG
A
STORY
I
HEARD
RECENTLY
THIS
IS
SECOND
HAND
SO
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TRUE
IT
IS
BUT
I
HAVE
NO
REASON
TO
DOUBT
IT
EITHER
BRADLEY
CENTER
IN
MILWAUKEE
IS
HOME
TO
THE
MILWAUKEE
ADMIRALS
MINOR
LEAUGE
HOCKEY
TEAM
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
ADMIRALS
SORRY
I
CANT
REMEMBER
HIS
NAME
EITHER
OWNS
OR
AT
LEAST
SHELLED
OUT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
FUNDS
TO
BUILD
THE
BRADLEY
CENTER
SUPPOSEDLY
HE
WAS
APPROACHED
BY
THE
NHL
ABOUT
AN
EXPANSION
FRANCHISE
BUT
TURNED
IT
DOWN
BECAUSE
HE
THOUGHT
THE
FRANCHISE
FEE
OF
MILLION
WAS
TOO
HIGH
LIKE
I
SAID
I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
THIS
STORY
IS
TRUE
OR
JUST
A
RUMOR
BUT
IF
ITS
TRUE
DONT
LOOK
FOR
AN
NHL
TEAM
IN
MILWAUKEE
ANYTIME
SOON
THE
ADMIRALS
ARENT
GOING
TO
BE
FORCED
OUT
OF
THE
BUILDING
AND
YOU
WONT
SEE
AN
NHL
CLUB
AND
A
MINOR
LEAGUE
CLUB
IN
THE
SAME
BUILDING
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
THE
NBAS
MILWAUKEE
BUCKS
PLAY
THERE
