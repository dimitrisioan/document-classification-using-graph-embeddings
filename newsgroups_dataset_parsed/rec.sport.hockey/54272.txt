I
THINK
THE
THREEHEADED
GMS
GUIDING
PRINCIPLE
WAS
TO
KEEP
VETERANS
IN
FAVOR
OF
YOUNGSTERS
ONLY
IF
THEY
OFFERED
A
SIGNIFICANT
ADVANTAGE
DOESNT
SOUND
LIKE
A
BAD
STRATEGY
TO
ME
NO
AND
IN
FACT
THAT
WAS
FERREIRAS
ORIGINAL
STRATEGY
WHICH
THE
TROIKA
PROCEEDED
TO
SIMPLY
CONTINUE
TO
IMPLEMENT
THERE
WASNT
EXACTLY
A
RADICAL
SHIFT
IN
POLICY
WHEN
HE
WAS
OUSTED
SOMETHING
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
FORGET
THE
ONLY
REAL
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
THEY
DID
IT
AS
WELL
AS
FERREIRA
COULD
HAVE
IF
HE
STAYED
OR
WHETHER
THE
BASIC
STRATEGY
WAS
FLAWED
SINCE
FERREIRA
HAS
BEEN
QUOATED
AS
SAYING
HES
GOING
TO
DO
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
IN
ANAHEIM
WITH
THE
DUCKS
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
IT
WASNT
AS
GOOD
IN
PRACTICE
AS
IT
WAS
ON
PAPER
AND
HES
TWEAKING
IT
A
BIT
SECOND
TIME
AROUND
ONE
ALSO
HAS
TO
WONDER
WHETHER
THE
STRATEGY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
LOT
BETTER
IF
WE
HADNT
HAD
THOSE
INJURIES
AND
WHETHER
WERE
COMPLAINING
ABOUT
THE
WEATHER
BECAUSE
AN
EARTHQUAKE
COLLAPSED
THE
ROOT
CELLAR
OF
COURSE
FERREIRA
HAD
ALSO
TRADED
A
NUMBER
OF
VETERANS
WITH
MARGINAL
CONTRIBUTIONS
BEFORE
HE
WAS
FIRED
SO
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
THAT
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DIFFERENT
BESIDES
THEY
WERE
MARGINAL
CONTRIBUTORS
LETS
ALSO
NOT
FORGET
THAT
FERREIRA
CAME
THIS
CLOSE
TO
TRADING
KELLY
KISIO
WHICH
IF
THE
RUMORS
IVE
HEARD
ARE
TRUE
WAS
OVER
THE
STRONG
OBJECTIONS
OF
OTHER
ASPECTS
OF
SHARK
MANAGEMENT
AND
PROBABLY
HAD
A
LOT
TO
DO
WITH
BOTH
HIS
OUSTER
AND
THE
THREEHEADED
CONSENSUS
ORIENTED
GM
IMAGINE
FOR
A
SECOND
WHERE
THE
SHARKS
WOULD
BE
TODAY
IF
THAT
FAX
MACHINE
HADNT
JAMMED
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
MULLEN
THEY
WERENT
GOING
TO
BE
A
PLAYOFF
TEAM
WHAT
GOOD
DOES
IT
DO
THEM
TO
HANG
ONTO
A
PLAYER
WHOD
RATHER
BE
ELSEWHERE
ESPECIALLY
AN
UNHAPPY
PLAYER
THAT
ISNT
PLAYING
AS
WELL
BECAUSE
OF
IT
NOT
THAT
ID
ACCUSE
MULLEN
OF
TANKING
BUT
HIS
MOTIVATION
SIMPLY
WASNT
THERE
AND
THAT
KIND
OF
THING
CAN
AFFECT
THE
TEAM
AN
EXAMPLE
FROM
THIS
SEASON
SKRIKO
WAS
BROUGHT
IN
ON
A
TRIAL
BASIS
BUT
NOT
KEPT
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
AGE
I
THOUGHT
HE
WAS
A
DECENT
CONTRIBUTOR
WORTH
KEEPING
AROUND
THE
YOUTH
MOVEMENT
HAS
ITS
ADVANTAGES
LOOK
AT
GAUDREAU
WHO
MIGHT
STILL
BE
IN
KC
IF
MORE
VETERANS
HAD
BEEN
KEPT
AROUND
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
FIND
THE
RIGHT
BALANCE
RIGHT
BALANCE
FOR
WHAT
THATS
THE
ISSUE
EXACTLY
AT
THE
TIME
THEY
LET
SKRIKO
GO
WE
HADNT
YET
HAD
THE
MAJOR
INJURY
BUGS
THAT
KILLED
US
LATER
ID
MUCH
RATHER
HAVE
SKRIKO
AROUND
THAN
SOMEONE
LIKE
DEAN
KOLSTAD
BUT
AT
THAT
POINT
THAT
WASNT
THE
CHOICE
AND
SINCE
THE
CHOICE
WAS
MORE
ONE
OF
SKRIKO
VS
SOMEONE
LIKE
JOHN
CARTER
I
THINK
THE
RIGHT
CHOICE
WAS
MADE
FOR
THAT
TIME
PERIOD
