wayne
made
his
own
bedchoosing
mcnall
over
sather
and
hockey
destinyhe
should
sleep
in
it
instead
of
whining
ego
got
absolute
nonsense
the
decision
that
was
made
was
pocklingtons
he
chose
mill
over
gretzky
if
gretzky
wasnt
upset
about
not
being
able
to
win
a
cup
in
la
then
i
submit
that
he
wasnt
worth
the
mill
the
best
of
himhe
thought
the
supporting
cast
in
edmonton
didnt
matterthat
he
was
the
show
himself
how
do
you
know
what
he
thinks
or
thought
the
only
thought
that
i
can
see
that
you
have
revealed
is
your
own
you
dont
like
gretzky
big
deal
now
my
only
complaint
about
lemieux
is
that
he
dives
too
much
but
last
year
patrick
convinced
him
twice
to
accept
bowman
and
hockey
destiny
rather
than
his
ego
the
real
purpose
of
diving
is
not
merely
an
attempt
to
draw
a
penalty
what
the
player
is
trying
to
do
is
make
the
checkers
keep
their
distance
so
the
ref
wont
be
fooled
i
cant
imagine
why
anyone
would
expect
someone
like
lemieux
to
change
his
game
why
dont
you
pick
on
dimensional
overrated
type
like
hull
and
salami
cordially
as
always
maynardramseycslaurentianca
so
many

rm
and
so
