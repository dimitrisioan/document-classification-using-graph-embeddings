maybe
we
should
get
together
and
establish
some
kind
of
mandatory
maturity
level
to
keep
some
of
this
stuff
off
of
the

roger
your
responses
might
just
exclude
you
from
sharing
your
opinions
then
you
see
the
same
rights
ali
has
to
mail
her
letter
to
the
nhl
are
the
same
ones
that
let
you
post
replies
that
mow
her
down
like
wheat
at
harvesttime
she
never
said
she
represented
the
entire
internet
or
the
entire
group
recsporthockey
she
has
every
right
to
state
her
opinion
along
with
those
of
the
fifty
or
sixty
or
hundredodd
folk
whove
agreed
to
allow
her
to
list
their
names
on
the
bottom
of
it
you
may
not
agree
with
it
fine
i
really
dont
care
enough
about
the
name
change
to
care
your
name
isnt
attached
to
it
so
why
moan
and
complain
if
you
felt
her
words
were
leading
well
youre
free
to
feel
that
way
and
take
exception
but
manners
never
hurt
i
personally
disagree
and
feel
her
generalizations
were
fine
i
have
the
right
to
think
and
say
that
too
alis
under
no
compunction
to
change
a
single
word
now
while
youre
free
to
disagree
with
every
word
she
wrote
to
tear
apart
her
character
is
uncalled
for
im
posting
this
as
a
form
of
public
reprimand
if
you
tear
down
alis
integrity
and
character
publicly
youll
get
chastised
publicly
in
return
would
it
have
been
so
hard
to
say
ali
please
be
a
bit
more
specific
in
your
description
the
way
ive
read
it
indicates
youre
stating
my
view
also
and
thats
simply
not
true
id
really
like
to
see
a
disclaimer
noting
that
you
dont
mean
the
entire
internet
or
the
entire
rsh
group
attached
to
it
despite
your
intent
to
list
names
at
the
bottom
thanks
cordially
as
always
c
calling
her
a
moron
and
an
asshole
just
reduces
the
weight
of
your
words
and
the
opinions
of
their
author
in
the
eyes
of
myself
and
possibly
others
oh
and
ali
nice
to
see
someone
standing
up
for
something
even
if
its
not
something
i
personally
advocate
valerie
hammerl
john
sr
would
lift
pat
over
the
boards
grab
hammerlacsubuffaloedu
his
hand
and
start
running
around
the
outside
faster
and
faster
i
wanted
to
learn
how
to
get
that
feeling
and
the
only
way
was
to
learn
how
to
skate
