ROBERT
ANDOLINA
WRITES
THE
THING
THAT
CONFUSES
ME
MOST
ABOUT
ESPN
IS
THAT
THEY
DECIDED
TO
SHOW
THE
PENGUINS
AND
DEVILS
AGAIN
ON
THURSDAY
NIGHT
BEING
THAT
BOTH
OF
THE
FIRST
TWO
GAMES
WERE
DOMINATED
BY
PITT
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THEY
WOULD
SHOW
A
DIFFERENT
GAME
THIS
IS
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
SHOULD
SHOW
OTHER
GAMES
JUST
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
FAIR
EXPOSURE
NESN
OWNS
THE
RIGHTS
TO
BRUIN
TELECASTS
I
SUSPECT
THAT
NESN
WAS
ONLY
GOING
TO
SELL
ONE
TELECAST
TO
ESPN
REMEMBER
ESPN
ONLY
OWNS
EXCLUSIVE
RIGHTS
TO
THE
FINALS
NOT
THE
ENTIRE
PLAYOFFS
SINCE
ESPN
BOUGHT
THE
SCA
CONTRACT
THERE
ARE
LESS
WRANGLES
TO
UNTIE
WITH
SHOWING
THE
DEVILS
AND
PENGUINS
ALSO
SOME
OF
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
THAT
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
TELL
ESPN
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
SHOW
CAMPBELL
CONFERENCE
GAMES
REGULARLY
IN
THE
FIRST
TWO
ROUNDS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
ARE
ONLY
GOING
TO
SHOW
CAMPBELL
GAMES
IN
THE
FIRST
TWO
ROUNDS
AS
THOSE
SERIES
WEAR
ON
GAMES
OR
PERHAPS
GAMES
I
THINK
THE
SAME
BROADCAST
RIGHTS
FACTOR
COMES
INTO
IT
PLUS
THEY
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
FITTING
WESTERN
GAME
TIMES
INTO
THEIR
CURRENT
SCHEDULE
UNLESS
THE
NHL
WAS
WILLING
TO
MAKE
A
WESTERN
CLUB
MOVE
UP
THEIR
GAME
I
THINK
THE
NHL
GOT
AS
MUCH
AS
IT
COULD
WHEN
IT
SHUFFLED
THE
DECK
FOR
ABC
ALSO
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
INFO
ON
ABC
COVERAGE
FOR
THIS
SUNDAY
SAME
EXACT
COVERAGE
AS
LAST
WEEK
PITNJ
GAME
IN
THE
EAST
CHISTL
IN
THE
CENTRAL
LACGY
IN
THE
MOUNTAINS
AND
WEST
