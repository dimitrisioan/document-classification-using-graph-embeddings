does
anyone
know
if
all
the
patrick
division
games
are
going
to
be
televised
on
espn
and
abc
if
some
games
are
going
to
be
left
outor
blanked
out
by
dumb
southern
abc
affiliates
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
knows
of
any
sports
bars
in
atlanta
which
are
frequented
by
hockey
fans
i
dont
want
to
miss
out
on
any
of
the
pens
games
i
am
sure
that
there
are
some
islander
fansnow
that
the
rangers
are
dead
who
would
want
to
watch
every
pensislanders
game
in
atlanta
circle
tuesdayapril
on
your
tv
calendar
espn
will
carry
from
pittsburghs
civic
arena
or
as
they
are
advetising
it
pittsburgh
vs
place
partick
div
finisher
personally
bruinsbuffalo
or
montreal
quebec
city
is
a
much
better
matchup
but
espn
is
hoping
for
a
spoiler
in
the
pens
series
which
its
not
likely
to
get
the
way
mario
has
been
playing
for
the
past
month
or
so
id
personally
prefer
buffaloboston
as
a
birthday
gift
from
espn
but
i
dont
think
the
folks
at
espn
will
accomodate
that
for
me
espn
has
this
inexplicable
affinity
for
the
patrick
division
it
seems
valerie
hammerl

days
i
have
to
remind
him
hes
not
