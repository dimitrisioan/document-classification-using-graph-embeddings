QUOTING
GREG
ROGERS
TO
ALL
GR
HI
ALL
GR
DUE
TO
LIVING
IN
THE
BAY
AREA
I
AS
UNABLE
TO
SEE
VANCOUVERS
VICTORY
GR
OVER
THE
JETS
LAST
NIGHT
I
KNOW
THE
SCORE
BUT
THAT
RARELY
DESCRIBES
GR
THE
GAME
COULD
SOMEONE
PLEASE
POST
A
BRIEF
SONAPSIS
SP
OF
WAHT

HOW
WELL

EACH
TEAM
PLAY
WERE
THE
CANNUCKS
DESERVING

INDIVIDUAL

STATS
GR
GREG
GR
VANCOUVER
FOR
THE
CUP
IN
A
VIRTUAL
REALITY
I
AM
SORRY
TO
TELL
YOU
THIS
GREG
BUT
IN
ALL
REALITY
WE
CANNOT
SEE
VANCOUVER
WINNING
THE
CUP
THEY
HAVE
A
RRALLY
GOOD
CHANCE
TO
COME
OUT
OF
THE
SMYTHE
DIVISION
AND
A
CHANCE
TO
MAKE
IT
TO
THE
FINALS
BUT
NO
ONE
IS
CAPABLE
THIS
YEAR
OF
BEATING
THE
PENGUINS
THEY
HAVE
TOO
MANY
SCORING
THREATS
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
BE
PROVEN
WRONG
BUT
I
MUST
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
PENS
WILL
WIN
CUP
THIS
YEAR
STEVE
MONDAYS
ARE
A
ROTTEN
WAY
TO
SPEND
A
OF
YOUR
LIFE
