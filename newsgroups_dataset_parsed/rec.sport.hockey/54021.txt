STUFF
DELETED
WHEN
QUINN
TOOK
OVER
VANCOUVER
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
NOT
LAST
YEAR
THEY
REGULARILY
MISSED
THE
PLAYOFFS
I
CANT
RECALL
IF
THEY
MISSED
THE
PLAYOFFS
THE
YEAR
BEFORE
HIS
HIRING
BUT
THEY
PROBABLY
DID
QUINN
HAS
IMPROVED
THE
TEAM
FROM
NONPLAYOFF
CALIBRE
TO
A
SERIOUS
CONTENDER
WHEN
MURRAY
TOOK
OVER
IN
DETROIT
THE
WERE
ABOUT
A
TEAM
THAT
WAS
A
CONTENDER
TO
WIN
THE
NORRIS
DIVISION
AND
POSSIBLY
EVEN
A
STANLEY
CUP
CONTENDER
THE
LAST
YEAR
BEFORE
BRYAN
MURRAY
TOOK
OVER
THE
WINGS
DID
NOT
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
WHILE
THEY
HAD
BEEN
CONSIDERED
A
POSSIBLE
CONTENDER
WHEN
JACQUES
DEMERS
FIRST
ARRIVED
IN
HIS
LAST
TWO
YEARS
THEY
WERE
RESPECTIVELY
EMBARRASSED
IN
THE
FIRST
ROUND
BY
CHICAGO
AND
THEN
FAILED
TO
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
AT
A
TIME
A
MIGHT
ADD
WHEN
THERE
WERE
ONLY
FIVE
TEAMS
IN
THE
NORRIS
ITS
TRUE
THAT
VANCOUVER
DID
NOT
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
FOR
MANY
A
YEAR
BEFORE
QUINN
CAME
BUT
IN
THOSE
YEARS
THE
SMYTHE
DIVISION
WAS
A
LOTI
MEAN
A
LOT
TOUGHER
DIVISION
THAN
THE
NORRIS
ALSO
KNOWN
AS
THE
SNORRIS
DIVISION
VANCOUVER
HAD
TO
PLAY
EDMONTON
AND
CALGARY
BOTH
VERY
LEGITIMATE
STANLEY
CUP
CONTENDERS
EIGHT
TIMES
A
YEAR
WHILE
DETROIT
GOT
TO
PLAY
SUCH
POWERHOUSES
AS
TORONTO
AND
MINNESOTA
NOW
EDMONTON
IS
HARDLY
EVEN
A
FORCE
IN
THE
LEAGUE
AND
THE
SMYTHE
EVEN
HAS
THE
MIGHTY
SAN
JOSE
SHARKS
WHILE
OVER
THIS
SAME
PERIOD
OF
TIME
IN
WHICH
VANCOUVER
WAS
IMPROVING
SO
WAS
EVERYBODY
IN
THE
NORRIS
EXCEPT
ST
LOUIS
DETROIT
HAD
TO
IMPROVE
JUST
TO
KEEP
UP
WITH
THE
COMPETITION
IN
THEIR
DIVISION
THEY
HAD
TO
IMPROVE
A
LOT
TO
GET
BETTER
THAN
THEIR
COMPETITION
IN
THE
NORRIS
BRYAN
MURRAY
INHERITED
A
TEAM
WITH
VERY
LITTLE
TALENT
FOR
REALLY
GOOD
PLAYERS
THEY
HAD
YZERMAN
BURR
AND
PROBERT
AND
THAT
WAS
ABOUT
IT
AND
NO
DOUBT
SOME
WILL
DISPUTE
WHETHER
BURR
AND
PROBERT
WERE
THAT
GOOD
THE
REST
WERE
EITHER
VERY
GREEN
ROOKIES
OR
WASHED
UP
VETERANS
THE
ONLY
REASON
THEY
GOT
AS
FAR
AS
THEY
DID
IN
THE
YEARS
BEFORE
MURRAY
CAME
WAS
DUE
TO
THE
COACHING
OF
DEMERS
WHO
AT
LEAST
AT
FIRST
GOT
EVERY
LAST
OUNCE
OF
EFFORT
POSSIBLE
OUT
OF
HIS
TEAM
THEN
EVEN
HIS
COACHING
BEGAN
TO
DEGRADE
SO
QUINN
HAS
IMPROVED
HIS
TEAM
MORE
THAN
MURRAY
HAS
SINCE
TAKING
OVER
AS
A
GM
QUINN
IS
ONE
EXAMPLE
OF
A
BETTER
GM
THAN
MURRAY
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
WHY
DETROIT
WASNT
IN
AS
BAD
A
SHAPE
STANDINGS
WISE
WHEN
MURRAY
TOOK
OVER
AS
VANC
WAS
WHEN
QUINN
TOOK
OVER
SOME
OF
WHICH
I
OUTLINED
ABOVE
BUT
MURRAY
DID
NOT
HAVE
ANY
BETTER
PERSONNEL
TO
WORK
WITH
AT
THE
OUTSET
THAN
DID
QUINN
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
YZERMAN
AND
ONE
PLAYER
CANNOT
ALONE
MAKE
A
TEAM
INTO
A
STANLEY
CUP
CONTENDER
AS
IM
SURE
EVERYONE
READING
THIS
WILL
AGREE
WELL
BE
ABLE
TO
SEE
BETTER
WHICH
TEAM
IS
REALLY
THE
MOST
IMPROVED
WHEN
THEY
FACE
EACH
OTHER
IN
THE
CONFERENCE
FINAL
ASSUMING
THEY
DONT
GET
KNOCKED
OUT
LIKE
LAST
YEAR
