PAUL
STEWART
IS
THE
WORST
AND
MOST
BIASED
REF
PRESENTLY
IN
THE
NHL
HE
CALLED
A
TOTAL
OF
PENALTIES
ON
THE
HABS
AND
ONE
ON
THE
NORDIQUES
THE
NORDS
PENALTY
CAME
IN
OT
STEWART
BEING
AN
EXNORDIQUE
HIMSELF
WAS
LOOKING
TO
CALL
PENALTIES
ON
THE
HABS
WHILE
LETTING
THE
NORDS
GET
AWAY
WITH
MURDERWE
WAS
ROBBED
NO
PATRICK
ROY
IS
THE
REASON
THE
GAME
WAS
LOST
AND
RON
HEXTALL
IS
THE
REASON
QUEBEC
WON
EVERYBODY
SAID
IT
WOULD
COME
DOWN
TO
GOALTENDING
THAT
GOALTENDING
WAS
THE
KEY
ETC
ETC
WELL
THE
KEY
DOESNT
QUITE
FIT
IF
YOURE
MONTREAL
I
DONT
BUY
THIS
AT
ALL
ROY
WAS
THE
REASON
THE
GAME
WAS
TIED
AND
THAT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
THE
CASE
HAD
DIONNE
KEPT
HIS
COOL
HEXTALL
GAVE
UP
VERY
QUESTIONABLE
GOALS
HIMSELF
BOTH
DIONNES
AND
BELLOWS
SHOTS
WERE
MISPLAYED
BY
HEXTALL
BUT
JUST
BECAUSE
HIS
GAFFES
WERE
EARLY
IN
THE
GAME
NO
ONE
SEEMS
TO
CARE
ROY
STOOD
ON
HIS
HEAD
FOR
THE
FIRST
MINUTES
OF
THE
GAME
WHEN
THE
NORDS
WERE
RUSHING
FROM
ENDTOEND
KAMENSKYS
MINIBREAK
AFTER
THE
TYING
GOAL
AND
THE
FIRST
SHOT
BY
YOUNG
IN
OT
WERE
BOTH
EXCELLENT
CHANCES
STOPPED
BY
ROY
ROY
OUTPLAYED
HEXTALL
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
GAME
BUT
ROY
BECOMES
THE
VILLAIN
AND
HEXTALL
THE
HERO
BECAUSE
ROYS
TEAM
DIDNT
MAKE
FULL
USE
OF
THEIR
OPPORTUNITIES
HEXTALL
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HAD
A
LOT
OF
LUCKY
BOUNCES
HE
PLAYED
VERY
WELL
BUT
THE
HALLER
SHOT
OFF
THE
POST
IN
OT
THE
REBOUND
BOUNCING
OVER
BELLOWS
STICK
THE
BRUNET
BREAKAWAY
THE
CHANCES
FOR
LECLAIR
ALL
THOSE
OPPORTUNITIES
WERE
NOT
FINISHED
OFF
BY
MONTREAL
AND
IT
COST
THEM
HEXTALL
WASNT
PARTICULARLY
BRILLIANT
ON
THOSE
PLAYS
BLAMING
STEWART
IS
JUST
AN
EXCUSE
TO
AVOID
FACING
THE
FACT
THAT
ROY
ALLOWED
WHAT
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
WORST
GOALS
HE
COULD
POSSIBLY
ALLOW
HE
EVEN
SAW
THE
WHOLE
SHOT
DAMMIT
SURE
NO
EXCUSE
BUT
IT
WAS
JUST
THE
GOAL
THE
TIMING
STANK
BUT
AGAINST
AN
EXPLOSIVE
TEAM
LIKE
QUEBEC
THEY
GAVE
THEM
OPPORTUNITY
TOO
MANY
WITH
A
POWERPLAY
THAT
WAS
TOTALLY
UNNECESSARY
MONTREAL
PLAYED
A
SOLID
GAME
ALTHOUGH
THEY
STILL
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
CLEAR
TRAFFIC
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
THE
LOSS
OF
SCHNEIDER
WILL
HURT
EVEN
MORE
I
DISAGREE
ROY
PLAYED
WELL
BECAUSE
HE
WASNT
SCREENED
THE
WHOLE
NIGHT
THE
DEFENSE
FOR
THE
TIME
THIS
SEASON
PLAYED
REMARKABLY
KEEPING
SAKIC
NOLAN
AND
SUNDIN
OUT
OF
THE
SLOT
MOST
OF
THE
NIGHT
NORMALLY
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
ANY
TEAM
THAT
BLOWS
A
LEAD
WITH
LESS
THAN
FIVE
LET
ALONE
TWO
MINUTES
TO
GO
IN
REGULATION
TIME
IN
A
PLAYOFF
GAME
ESPECIALLY
NEEDS
TO
BE
SMACKED
UPSIDE
THEIR
COLLECTIVE
HEADS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
WAS
A
TEAM
LOSS
ALTHOUGH
KEANE
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
CLEAR
THE
ZONE
JUST
PRIOR
TO
THE
FIRST
QUEBEC
GOAL
THIS
MOST
CERTAINLY
WAS
A
TEAM
LOSS
LECLAIR
MISSED
HIS
OPPORTUNITIES
AS
DID
BELLOWS
AND
BRUNET
DIONNE
TOOK
A
BAD
PENALTY
DAMPHOUSSE
AND
LEBEAU
WERE
SILENT
CARBONNEAU
AND
SAVARD
WERE
A
STEP
BEHIND
ALL
NIGHT
ROY
GAVE
UP
THE
BAD
GOAL
ROY
BY
NO
MEANS
CAN
BE
SINGLED
OUT
FOR
THIS
LOSS
ROY
IS
PAID
BIG
MONEY
TO
PLAY
HE
LOOKED
LIKE
A
PLAYER
IN
AN
INDUSTRIAL
LEAGUE
ON
SAKICS
SHOT
AND
HEXTALL
DIDNT
ON
DIONNES
GOAL
PLEASE
ROY
IS
PAID
BIG
MONEY
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
HIS
VALUE
COMPARED
TO
OTHER
GOALIES
AND
HE
STILL
IS
IN
THE
TOP
WHEN
YOU
CONSIDER
THE
DEFENSE
OR
LACK
OF
ONE
THAT
PLAYED
IN
FRONT
OF
HIM
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
SEASON
DEMERS
SHOULD
START
RACICOT
IN
THE
NEXT
GAME
IF
NOT
THAT
HE
SHOULD
LET
THE
DAMN
TEAM
READ
THE
PAPERS
FOR
THE
NEXT
DAY
OR
TWOAND
MAYBE
THIS
ARTICLE
IF
POSSIBLE
THE
MONTREAL
MEDIA
IS
THE
QUICKEST
TO
HEAP
PRAISE
AND
THEN
HURL
DEROGATORY
COMMENTS
AGAINST
THE
HABS
THEY
ARE
NO
BETTER
THAN
UNINFORMED
FANS
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
READ
THE
PAPERS
THEY
PLAYED
MINUTES
OF
BURNSIAN
HOCKEY
TO
SHUT
DOWN
QUEBEC
ALL
THEY
NEED
TONIGHT
AND
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
SERIES
IS
THE
EXTRA
RED
LIGHT
TO
FACE
QUEBECRUBBISH
THATS
A
GUARANTEED
WAY
TO
END
THE
SERIES
WHO
WOULD
BE
TAUGHT
A
LESSON
BY
THIS
THE
FANS
THE
MEDIA
AND
RACICOT
PERHAPS
CERTAINLY
NOT
THE
REST
OF
THE
TEAM
I
DIDNT
THINK
THE
WRAPAROUND
WAS
AS
BAD
AS
THE
SECOND
GOAL
I
ALSO
DIDNT
THINK
SCOTT
YOUNG
SHOULD
HAVE
GOTTEN
AROUND
THE
DEFENDER
CANT
REMEMBER
WHO
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
BUT
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
IT
SHOULDNT
HAVE
GONE
IN
REGARDLESS
IF
YOU
MEAN
THE
GOAL
SHOULD
NEVER
HAVE
GONE
IN
BECAUSE
THERE
SHOULD
NEVER
HAVE
BEEN
AN
OT
THEN
I
AGREE
BUT
THE
GOAL
ITSELF
WAS
A
GREAT
PIECE
OF
WORK
BY
YOUNG
ROY
HAD
BOTH
THE
NEAR
AND
FAR
POSTS
COVERED
BUT
YOUNG
FLIPPED
THE
PUCK
UP
UNDER
ROYS
ARM
AS
HE
WRAPPEDAROUND
