are
predicting
although
i
think
bryan
murray
is
probably
the
best
gm
i
have
ever
seen
in
hockey
how
do
you
figure
that
when
bryan
murray
took
over
the
wings
they
were
a
pretty
good
team
that
was
contending
for
the
stanley
cup
but
looked
unlikely
to
win
it
now
they
are
a
pretty
good
team
that
is
contending
for
the
stanley
cup
but
looks
unlikely
to
win
it
a
truly
great
gm
would
have
been
able
to
make
the
moves
to
push
the
team
to
the
upper
echelon
of
the
nhl
and
maybe
win
the
stanley
cup
a
good
gm
like
murray
can
i
think
murray
has
done
a
great
job
hes
picked
up
ciccarelli
sheppard
ysebaert
howe
coffey
and
riendeau
plus
some
depth
players
without
giving
up
anything
the
wings
needed
or
any
of
his
top
prospects
all
of
this
in
three
years
has
anyone
done
better
the
year
before
he
took
over
the
wings
didnt
even
make
the
playoffs
there
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
during
demers
stint
that
the
wings
did
ok
but
that
was
due
to
demers
motavational
skills
and
clutch
and
grab
style
they
didnt
have
much
talent
gerald
murray
wasnt
responsible
for
primeau
although
im
not
ready
to
admit
thats
a
horrible
pick
they
hired
him
after
the
draft
which
has
never
made
sense
to
me
his
first
pick
was
lapointe
ron
and
one
of
my
major
goals
is
to
leave
the
next
president
a
new
set
of
things
to
worry
about
im
getting
bored
reading
the
same
problems
in
the
paper
decade
after
decade
i
want
people
to
have
to
deal
with
new
problems
president
bill
clinton
