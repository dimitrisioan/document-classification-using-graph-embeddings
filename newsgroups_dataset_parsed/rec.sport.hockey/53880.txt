various

rantings
on
espn
coverage
by
several
deleted
the
only
way
to
change
espns
thinking
if
it
is
even
possible
is
to
complain
to
them
directly
anyone
know
there
telephone
in
bristol
ct
heh
try
the
recautossport
faq
they
are
always
calling
espn
to
complain
im
sure
you
could
find
the
number
for
abc
there
too
as
many
westcoast
viewers
were
compaining
about
how
something
as
boring
as
hockey
cut
into
the
long
beach
gp
i
do
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
espn
doesnt
think
viewers
will
simply
change
the
channel
from
a
boring
gamei
know
i
did
and
then
when
they
didnt
show
the
nyiwash
overtimes
i
was
livid
if
i
wanted
to
watch
baseball
i
could
have
turned
on
the
philliespadres
extra
inning
gameinstead
i
went
to
bed
angryi
boycotted
espns
morning
sportscenter
today
i
was
still
so
incensed
were
you
and
several
of
the
other
people
here
it
seems
asleep
the
day
contracts
were
explained
aspn
has
a
piece
of
paper
saying
it
must
show
that
baseball
game
if
it
happens
many
businesses
payedd
money
to
have
their
commercials
run
during
a
baseball
game
this
is
a
business
not
your
own
personal
video
servant
my
wife
says
i
shouldnt
go
to
bed
angry
but
last
nitegrrrrrrr
maybe
you
should
put
that
anger
into
something
positive
for
example
i
saw
ads
for
the
new
dodge
both
on
the
espn
and
kbl
broadcasts
why
not
write
to
dodge
saying
that
thanks
to
the
ads
run
during
the
stanley
cup
playoffs
you
will
now
concider
their
products
in
the
future
they
love
to
hear
stuff
like
that
and
in
the
future
will
be
more
willing
to
buy
commercial
time
for
hockey
games
giving
espn
and
other
networks
more
incentive
to
carry
games
just
one
example
come
on
people
as
great
as
we
think
it
is
hockey
does
not
leapfrog
