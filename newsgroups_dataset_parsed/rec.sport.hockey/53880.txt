THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
CHANGE
ESPNS
THINKING
IF

ARE
ALWAYS
CALLING

THE
NUMBER
FOR
ABC

TOO
AS
MANY
WESTCOAST
VIEWERS
WERE
COMPAINING
ABOUT
HOW
SOMETHING
AS
BORING
AS
HOCKEY
CUT
INTO
THE
LONG
BEACH
GP
I
DO
FIND
IT
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
ESPN
DOESNT
THINK
VIEWERS
WILL
SIMPLY
CHANGE
THE
CHANNEL
FROM
A
BORING
GAMEI

INTO

POSITIVE
FOR

I
SAW
ADS
FOR
THE

BOTH
ON
THE
ESPN
AND
KBL

WHY
NOT
WRITE
TO
DODGE
SAYING
THAT
THANKS
TO

NOW
CONCIDER
THEIR
