i
cant
understand
how
someone
in
the
sports
dept
cant
even
recognise
the
name
of
playoffs
shown
on
the
very
same
station
he
works
for
you
think
thats
bad
one
year
we
had
all
three
new
york
teams
in
the
playoffs
and
the
cableco
operator
scny
once
shared
a
channel
with
bet
but
someone
forgot
to
throw
the
switch
at
didnt
know
what
i
was
talking
about
while
its
nice
that
the
nhl
is
back
on
american
network
tv
it
faces
the
same
problems
as
it
did
with
the
all
star
game
local
preemptions
and
zero
promotion
okay
i
dont
watch
that
much
tv
so
im
just
foaming
all
right
the
league
should
have
made
sure
that
it
was
solid
on
cable
before
going
to
the
networks
in
year
one
of
the
new
espn
contract
the
saturation
coverage
of
sca
all
other
games
shown
to
completion
like
the
quebecmontreal
and
sabresbruins
overtimes
is
missed
around
