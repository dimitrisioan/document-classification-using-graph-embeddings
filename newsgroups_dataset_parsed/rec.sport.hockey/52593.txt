HAS
REPORTED
THAT

WILL

PLAYERS
MILLION
INCLUDING

AND
BRIAN
BELLOWS

PHILLIDELPHIA
PHILLIE
WILL
SEND
ERIC
LINDROS
TO
OTTAWA
AND
OTTAWA
WILL
GIVE
ITS
FIRST
ROUND
PICK
TO
MONTREAL
OBVIOUSLY
SOME
REPORTER
FOR
THE
OTTAWA
SUN
GOT
TAKEN
BY
AN
APRIL
FOOLS
JOKEPROBABLY
STARTED
BY
SOMEONE
WITH
THE
NORDIQUES
OR
THE
BRUINS

GOING
TO
REIMBURSE
THE
FLYERS
FOR
THE
MILLION
THEY
PAID
TO
THE
NORDIQUESLIKE
THE

ARE
GOING
TO
GET
LINDROS
AND

THE
FLYERS
SENT
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
OR
PLAYERS
WHEN
YOU
INCLUDE
THE
DRAFT
CHOICES
TO
QUEBEC
AND
THEY
ARE
GOING
TO
GET
ONLY
FOUR
BACK
SOME
REPORTER
WAS
HAD
REAL
BADLY
AND
SOMEONE
MUST
BE
HAVING
A
REAL
GOOD
LAUGH
SEEING
AS
HOW
THE
SO
MUCH
OF
THE
SPORTS
MEDIA
HAS
CHOSEN
TO
PUBLICIZE
THIS
UTTER
NONSENSE
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
IT
WILL
MOST
LIKELY
DEPEND
ON
WHETHER

OTTAWA
GETS
TO

YOU
THINKIT
CANNOT
POSSIBLY
BE
TRUENO
NEED
FOR
THE
IF
PERSONALLY
I
CANT
SEE
PHILLI
GIVING
UP
LINDROS
FOR
ANYTHING
THEY
DIDNT
GIVE
AWAY
THAT
MUCH
TO
QUEBEC
JUST
TO
TRADE
HIM
AWAY
AGAIN
NOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
LINDROS
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
HUGE
DRAW
IN
PHILLIE
AND
THAT
HE
REPRESENTS
A
SUCCESSFUL
FUTURE
FOR
THE
FRANCHISE
OTTAWA
MAY
BE
BETTER
OFF
TAKING
THE
PLAYERS
FROM
MONTREAL
FOR
THE
PICK
I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
ANYONE
WOULD
CONSIDER
GIVING
SUCH
CRAP
EVEN
THE
REMOTEST
CONSIDERATION
