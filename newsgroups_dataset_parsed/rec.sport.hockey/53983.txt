WELL
WELL
THEY
DONT
LIKE
OUR
DEFENDERS
MAINLY
LUMME
AND
NUMMINEN
CJARI
CCHRISTIAN
NOW
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
RUUTTU
IS
ONLY
WORTH
I
THINK
IT
MIGHT
BE
RTEEMU
COMPARED
TO
KURRI
SELANNES
POINTS
ARE
TOO
HIGH
LETS
MAKE
IT
OR
WELL
IN
THE
CANADA
CUP
AND
WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS
LARGELY
DUE
TO
THE
EFFORTS
OF
MARKUS
KETTERER
THE
GOALIE
OR
THE
PLAYERS
LISTED
ABOVE
AND
LUCK
THERES
PRESUMABLY
A
LOT
OF
DECENT
PLAYERS
IN
FINLAND
THAT
WOULDNT
BE
SUPERSTARS
AT
THE
HIGHEST
LEVEL
BUT
STILL
VALUABLE
ROLE
PLAYERS
HOWEVER
MY
GUESS
WOULD
BE
THAT
THE
FINNISH
CANADA
CUP
TEAM
WOULD
BE
A
TEAM
IN
THE
NHL
WOW
NOW
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
YOU
DONT
LIKE
OUR
PLAYERS
WHAT
ABOUT
GUYS
LIKE
NIEMINEN
JUTILA
RIIHIJARVI
VARVIO
LAUKKANEN
MAKELA
KESKINEN
AND
EVEN
IF
HE
IS
AGING
RUOTSALAINEN
THE
MAIN
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
FINNISH
AND
NORTH
AMERICAN
PLAYERS
IS
THAT
OUR
PLAYERS
TEND
TO
BE
BETTER
IN
THE
LARGER
RINK
THE
CANADIAN
DEFENDERS
ARE
USUALLY
SLOWER
THAT
DEFENDERS
IN
EUROPE
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THERE
WAS
MORE
IN
OUR
SUCCESS
THAN
KETTERER
AND
LUCK
THOUGH
THEY
HELPED
I
THINK
THAT
THE
MAIN
REASON
WAS
THAT
THE
TEAM
WORKED
WELL
TOGETHER
