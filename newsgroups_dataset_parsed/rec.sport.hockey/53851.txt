WRITES
I
WAS
WTAHCING
RIGHT
GUARD
HOCKEY
WEEK
ON
TSN
YESTERDAY
AND
THEY
HAD
A
FEATURE
ON
THIS
GUY
THAT
DOES
A
LOT
MOST
OF
THE
MASKS
FOR
NHL
GOALIES
THEY
TALKED
ABOUT
HOW
THEY
ARE
MADE
WHAT
THEY
ARE
MADE
OF
AND
THE
DESIGNS
THAT
ARE
PUT
ON
THEM
ETC
THE
BEST
ONE
OF
ALL
WAS
ONE
HE
NEVER
TALKED
ABOUT
HE
JUST
HELD
IT
UP
IT
HAS
THE
CURRENT
LEAFS
CREST
ON
THE
CHIN
AND
AN
AWESOME
LOOKING
BLACK
PANTHER
ON
THE
FOREHEAD
IT
HAS
TO
BE
A
NEW
MASK
FOR
FELIX
POTVIN
BUT
HE
NEVER
SAID
WHOSE
IT
WAS
ARE
YOU
SURE
THIS
PROGRAM
WAS
CURRENT
I
KNOW
THAT
GRANT
FUHR
HAD
A
BLACK
PANTHER
ON
THE
FOREHEAD
OF
HIS
MASK
WHEN
HE
PLAYED
WITH
THE
LEAFS
IT
WOULD
SEEM
LOGICAL
THAT
THE
MASK
IS
POTVINS
HIS
NICKNAME
IS
THE
CAT
WHICH
WOULD
GO
A
LONG
WAYS
TOWARDS
EXPLAINING
THE
PANTHER
OF
COURSE
IT
COULD
BE
AN
OLD
STORY
AND
THE
MASK
IS
FUHRS
TOO
