BIGGEST
SUPRISE

LOS
ANGELES
KINGS
ROBITAILLE
DONNELLY
HRUDEY
I
WOULD
HAVE
CHOSEN
ALEX
ZHITNIK
FOR
BIGGEST
SUPRISE
THEY
DID
EXPECT
THAT
HE
WOULD
BECOME
A
GREAT
DEFENSEMAN
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
ANYONE
KNEW
THAT
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
BE
THIS
IMPRESSIVE
IN
HIS
ROOKIE
YEAR
HIS
SPEED
SKATING
ABILITY
AND
PUCK
CONTROL
IS
EXCEPTIONAL
HE
IS
THE
ONE
TO
WATCH
ON
THE
KINGS
I
AGREE
WITH
MARTY
MCSORELY
AND
WARREN
RYCHEL
RUNNING
A
CLOSE
SECOND
AND
THIRD
I
AM
SURPRISED
MORE
PEOPLE
HAVE
NOT
NOTED
KNICKLE
AS
THE
BIGGEST
SURPRISE
EVEN
THOUGH
I
PERSONALLY
DO
NOT
REALLY
RATE
HIM
WELL
THE
BIGGEST
DISAPPOINTMENT
HAS
TO
BE
CARSON
THOUGH
THIS
IS
REALLY
UNFAIR
SINCE
TOO
MUCH
WAS
EXPECTED
OF
HIM
THE
SECOND
BIGGEST
DISAPPOINTMENT
IS
MELROSE
WITH
HIS
ADOLESCENT
HANDLING
OF
THE
GOALTENDING
PROBLEMS
PUTTING
HRUDEY
ON
THE
BENCH
FOR
A
MONTH
IS
JUST
STUPID
IT
DID
NOT
CONTRIBUTE
TO
THE
TEAM
COMING
OUT
OF
ITS
SLUMP
MVP
IS
SURELY
ROBITAILLE
