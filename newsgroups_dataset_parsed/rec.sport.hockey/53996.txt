re
wings
news
and
playoff
thoughts
i
wrote
i
feel
the
jury
is
still
out
on
tim
cheveldae
as
a
playoff
goalie
he
was
average
in
his
first
playoffs
last
year
he
had
a
horrible
start
but
played
great
the
last
ten
games
after
he
was
benched
his
gaa
even
with
the
horrible
start
was
last
year
this
year
i
think
hes
going
to
play
very
well
he
has
to
if
detroit
is
going
to
win
the
cup
he
wasnt
sharp
in
game
but
he
didnt
have
to
be
i
thought
he
looked
pretty
good
yesterday
charles
hubbert
writes
great
write
up
of
the
wingstoronto
series
thus
far
i
agree
with
just
about
everything
that
you
said
but
chevy
shouldnt
have
let
the
shot
from
the
right
point
in
first
goal
mikorov
i
think
other
than
that
the
wings
are
looking
good
and
chevy
is
holding
his
own
not
great
but
maybe
chevy
has
let
in
or
soft
goals
so
far
but
they
all
didnt
matter
however
his
recent
history
has
been
inconsistant
play
but
comes
up
big
when
it
counts
the
score
was
i
think
when
the
goal
you
mentioned
was
scored
in
the
third
period
when
it
looked
like
toronto
was
coming
back
chevy
was
exceptional
i
can
see
him
as
a
barraso
style
playoff
goalie
inconsistant
when
theres
nothing
on
the
line
but
comes
up
big
when
really
needed
i
guess
well
both
find
out
ron
and
one
of
my
major
goals
is
to
leave
the
next
president
a
new
set
of
things
to
worry
about
im
getting
bored
reading
the
same
problems
in
the
paper
decade
after
decade
i
want
people
to
have
to
deal
with
new
problems
president
bill
clinton
