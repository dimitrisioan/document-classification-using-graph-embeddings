ESPN
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
ANYONE
HAS
POSTED
A
MESSAGE
LIKE
THIS
YET
BUT
IM
GETTING
REALLY
SICK
OF
ESPN
SHOWING
THE
LAST
MINUTE
OF
A
HOCKEY
GAME
IN
WHICH
THE
SCORE
WAS
JUST
TIED
AND
THEN
CUTTING
OUT
AND
SAYING
SORRY
WE
CANT
SHOW
YOU
THIS
WE
HAVE
TO
SHOW
BASEBALL
TONIGHT
NOT
EVEN
A
GAME
A
FRIGGIN
HIGHLIGHT
SHOW
GEE
SURE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NICE
TO
SEE
THE
ISLESCAPS
IN
OVERTIME
I
LIVE
IN
PITTSBURGH
YES
IM
A
PENS
FAN
WHERE
HOCKEY
GETS
A
LOT
OF
COVERAGE
I
CAN
ONLY
IMAGINE
HOW
A
CAPS
FAN
RESIDING
IN
TEXAS
MUST
FEEL
