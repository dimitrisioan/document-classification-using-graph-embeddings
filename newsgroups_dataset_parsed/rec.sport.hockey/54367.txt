REACTIONS
I
AM
SURE
SOME
BASHERS
OF
PENS
FANS
ARE
PRETTY
CONFUSED
ABOUT
THE
LACK
OF
ANY
KIND
OF
POSTS
ABOUT
THE
RECENT
PENS
MASSACRE
OF
THE
DEVILS
ACTUALLY
I
AM
BIT
PUZZLED
TOO
AND
A
BIT
RELIEVED
HOWEVER
I
AM
GOING
TO
PUT
AN
END
TO
NONPITTSBURGHERS
RELIEF
WITH
A
BIT
OF
PRAISE
FOR
THE
PENS
MAN
THEY
ARE
KILLING
THOSE
DEVILS
WORSE
THAN
I
THOUGHT
JAGR
JUST
SHOWED
YOU
WHY
HE
IS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
HIS
REGULAR
SEASON
STATS
HE
IS
ALSO
A
LOT
FO
FUN
TO
WATCH
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
BOWMAN
SHOULD
LET
JAGR
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
FUN
IN
THE
NEXT
COUPLE
OF
GAMES
SINCE
THE
PENS
ARE
GOING
TO
BEAT
THE
PULP
OUT
OF
JERSEY
ANYWAY
I
WAS
VERY
DISAPPOINTED
NOT
TO
SEE
THE
ISLANDERS
LOSE
THE
FINAL
REGULAR
SEASON
GAME
PENS
RULE
