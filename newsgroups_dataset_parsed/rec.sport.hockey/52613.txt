fencesittinglook
at
phillys
record
with
eric
and
without
there
is
no
doubt
soderstrom
is
probably
the
biggest
surprise
re
eric
true
but
fortunately
we
didnt
get
to
find
out
what
they
would
be
like
without
recchi
for
games
soderstrom
absolutely
shutouts
in
games
for
a
rookie
without
a
lot
of
defense
in
front
of
him
runnerups
to
galley
and
fedyk
who
are
scoring
a
ton
over
their
career
best
but
galley
thinks
hes
paul
coffey
puts
scoring
ahead
of
defending
and
fedyk
has
tailed
off
big
time
eklund
was
a
big
question
mark
this
year
and
was
coming
off
injuries
points
in
games
is
not
bad
at
all
and
recently
hes
been
a
huge
factor
in
the
wins
theyve
gotten
eklund
has
never
had
a
point
a
game
season
in
his
career
his
production
is
very
typical
for
him
how
does
he
qualify
as
a
disappointment
if
anything
hes
a
surprise
my
choice
would
be
roussel
if
i
went
strictly
by
what
was
expected
of
players
but
i
never
thought
that
he
had
what
it
takes
to
be
a
goalie
my
biggest
disappointment
is
bill
dineen
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
be
the
perfect
coach
for
this
young
team
instead
hes
made
too
many
bad
moves
and
imho
has
cost
them
enough
games
to
keep
them
out
of
the
playoffs
this
year
any
coach
that
thinks
putting
eric
lindros
at
the
point
on
power
plays
is
a
bright
idea
needs
to
go
back
to
coaching
school
