RE
NHL
DRAFT
IN
ARTICLE
SHAWN
LUDDINGTON
WRITES
AS
FOR
THE
PICKS
OTTAWA
PICKS
WHICH
MEANS
IT
IS
ALMOST
THAT
ALEXANDER
DAIGLE
WILL
GO
HELL
EITHER
STAY
OR
BE
TRADED
IN
MONTREAL
OR
QUEBEC
IMO
I
WOULD
TAKE
KARIYA
HE
SHOULD
ALOT
OF
LEADERSHIP
IN
THE
NCAA
AND
SO
FAR
IN
THE
WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS
DAIGLE
DIDNT
SHOW
THIS
FOR
HIS
JUNIOR
TEAM
SAN
JOSE
WILL
THEN
GET
KARIYA
TAMPA
BAY
WILL
EITHER
GO
FOR
A
RUSSIAN
KOZLOV
I
THINK
THATS
IT
OR
A
DEFENSEMAN
ROB
NIEDEMEYER
PROBABLY
SPELT
THE
LAST
NAME
WRONG
THE
LAST
NAME
IS
NIEDERMAYER
AS
IN
NEW
JERSEYS
SCOTTS
LAST
NAME
BECAUSE
YOU
GUESSED
IT
THEY
ARE
BROTHERS
BUT
ROB
NIEDERMAYER
IS
A
CENTER
NOT
A
DEFENSEMAN
I
AM
NOT
SURE
THAT
THE
SHARKS
WILL
TAKE
KARIYA
THEY
ARENT
SAYING
MUCH
BUT
THEY
APPARENTLY
LIKE
NIEDERMAYER
AND
VICTOR
KOZLOV
ALONG
WITH
KARIYA
CHRIS
PRONGERS
NAME
HAS
ALSO
BEEN
MENTIONED
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
THEYLL
TAKE
NIEDERMAYER
THEY
MAY
TAKE
PRONGER
EXCEPT
THAT
THEY
ALREADY
HAVE
TOO
MANY
DEFENSIVE
PROSPECTS
GO
CALGARY
FLAMES
AL
MACINNIS
FOR
NORRIS
GARY
ROBERTS
FOR
HART
AND
