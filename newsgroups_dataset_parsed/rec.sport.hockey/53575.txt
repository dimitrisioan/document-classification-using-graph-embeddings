SAYS
CHANCES
THIS
YEAR
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
LIKE
WASHINGTON
IS
THE
ONLY
TEAM
THAT
CAN
STOP
THE
PENGUINS
FROM
WINNING
THEIR
NEXT
STANLEY
CUP
REALLY
I
THINK
BOTH
THE
ISLANDERS
AND
DEVILS
WOULD
HAVE
A
BETTER
CHANCE
AT
THE
PENGUINS
THAN
THE
CAPITALS
IMO
REALLY
WHAT
MAKES
YOU
THINK
THE
ISLANDERS
HAVE
A
BETTER
SHOT
THEY
COULDNT
EVEN
BEAT
THE
WHALERS
IN
TWO
GAMES
YES
BUT
AS
HAS
BEEN
MENTIONED
MANY
TIMES
BEFORE
THE
ISLANDERS
PLAY
AT
THE
TALENT
LEVEL
OF
THEIR
OPPONENT
SINCE
HARTFORD
IS
PITIFUL
THE
ISLANDERS
PLAYED
PITIFUL
SINCE
PITTSBURGH
IS
GREAT
THE
ISLES
WILL
MOST
LIKELY
PLAY
GREAT
THIS
IS
MOST
LIKELY
DUE
TO
INEXPERIENCE
AND
VERY
POOR
SHOOTING
TO
GREG
YES
I
HAVE
NOTICED
THAT
THE
ISLANDERS
COULDNT
HIT
THE
BROAD
SIDE
OF
A
BARN
WITH
THE
PUCK
IF
THEY
WERE
TWO
FEET
IN
FRONT
OF
IT
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
SHOOTING
PERCENTAGES
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THAT
WOULD
HELP
SINCE
THEY
OFTEN
MISS
THE
NET
COMPLETELY
BUT
IT
MIGHT
SHED
SOME
LIGHT
ON
THE
SUBJECT
AND
MY
PLAYOFF
POOL
IS
RUNNING
EXACT
RULES
TO
BE
POSTED
TOMORROW

HESITATE
