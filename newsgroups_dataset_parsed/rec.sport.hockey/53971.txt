WRITES
I
WAS
WATCHING
THE
DETROITMINNESOTA
GAME
LAST
NIGHT
AND
THOUGHT
I
SAW
AN
OCTOPUS
ON
THE
ICE
AFTER
YSEBAERT
SCORED
TO
TIE
THE
GAME
AT
TWO
WHAT
GIVES
IS
THERE
SOME
CUSTOM
TO
THROW
OCTOPUSES
ON
THE
ICE
IN
DETROIT
IT
IS
A
LONG
STANDING
GOOD
LUCK
REDWINGS
TRADITION
TO
THROW
AN
OCTOPUS
ON
THE
ICE
DURING
A
STANLEY
CUP
GAME
THEY
SAY
IT
DATES
BACK
TO
AT
THE
OLYMPIA
WHEN
THE
WINGS
BECAME
THE
TEAM
I
THINK
TO
SWEEP
THE
CUP
IN
GAMES
A
LOT
HARDET
TO
THROW
ONE
FROM
JOE
LOUIS
SEATS
THAN
FROM
THE
OLD
OLYMPIA
BALCONY
THOUGH
FUNNIEST
I
EVER
SAW
WAS
WHEN
SOME
TIGER
FANS
THREW
ONE
ON
THE
FIELD
DURING
A
DETROITTORONTO
BASEBALL
GAME
I
WAS
LIVING
IN
CALIFORNIA
AND
THE
FOLKS
I
WAS
WATCHING
WITH
HAD
NEVER
HEARD
OF
HOCKEY
AND
WERE
INCREDULOUS
WHEN
I
RECOGNIZED
THE
OCTOPUS
BEFORE
THE
CAMERA
CLOSEUP
