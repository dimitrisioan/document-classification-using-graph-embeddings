EUROPEAN
EXPANSION
AND
OUR
FCKED
SYSTEM
EVERYONE
KEEPS
TALKING
ABOUT
EUROPEAN
EXPANSION
BY
THINKING
WISHFUL
THOUGHTS
BUT
BEING
TOTALLY
OFF
THE
BALL
THE
LEAGUE
FORMAT
WE
USE
HERE
IS
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
THAT
IN
EUROPE
FOR
THOSE
THAT
DONT
KNOW
THE
BEST
TEAMS
FROM
LOWER
DIVISIONS
GET
PROMOTED
AND
THE
WORST
GET
DEMOTED
WOULD
EUROPEAN
FANS
PUT
UP
WITH
OUR
IF
YOUVE
PAID
YOU
CAN
PLAY
ATTITUDE
HOW
LONG
WOULD
THEY
SUPPORT
TEAMS
THAT
ARE
RUN
ON
RANGERBASED
CORPORATE
THINKING
I
USE
THE
TERM
LIGHTLY
WE
DONT
NEED
A
GOOD
PRODUCT
BECAUSE
THESE
DUFFUSES
IN
NYC
WOULD
FILL
THE
ARENA
FOR
OTTAWAS
RECORD
EVERY
HAHA
SORRY
HAD
TA
SAY
IT
IF
HOCKEY
AND
OTHER
PRO
SPORTS
HAD
A
SIMILAR
SYSTEM
TO
EUROPE
MAYBE
TEAMS
LIKE
THE
RANGERS
WOULD
BE
FORCED
TO
COMPETE
OR
GET
DEMOTED
THE
FOURTH
DIVISION
WED
HAVE
MANY
MORE
TEAMSCENTRES
THAT
ARENT
AS
BIG
LIKE
HALIFAX
OR
ADIRONDACKOK
SO
HALIFAX
ISNT
A
GOOD
EXAMPLE
WOULD
EVENTUALLY
GET
PROMOTED
AND
EVERY
TEAM
WOULD
BE
SOMEWHAT
COMPETETIVE
WITHIN
ITS
OWN
DIVISION
UNLIKE
OTTAWA
SJ
EDMONTON
ETC
FANS
WOULD
EVENTUALLY
GET
REWARDED
FOR
THEIR
LOYALTY
OR
PENALIZED
FOR
THEIR
NEGLECT
AND
THE
LEAGUE
WOULD
BE
MORE
INTERESTING
AND
DYNAMIC
EVERY
YEAR
BECAUSE
OF
THE
INFLUX
OF
NEWLY
PROMOTED
TEAMS
AND
THE
HALIFAX
CITADELS
WIN
THE
STANLEY
CUPI
CAN
DREAM
CANT
I
LOOK
AT
BRITISH
OR
ANY
EUROPEAN
SOCCER
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
THEY
NEVER
HAVE
FAN
PROBLEMS
JUST
SOMEONE
WHO
THINKS
OUR
SYSTEM
REALLY
SUCKS
BARFLY
FEEL
FREE
TO
FLAME
ME
MY
ACCOUNT
ENDS
TODAYHAHAHAHA
