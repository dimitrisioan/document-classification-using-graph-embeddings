CAROL
V
BOUDREAU
WRITES
IN
THE
SMYTHE
THIS
ONE
IS
THE
TOUGHEST
FOR
ME
TO
CALL
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
TO
PUT
PERSONAL
BIAS
ASIDE
GO
CALGARY
I
THINK
A
LOT
DEPENDS
ON
WHO
WINS
THE
DIVISION
WINNIPEG
WILL
MOVE
INTO
THIRD
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
AND
THE
FIRST
PLACE
WINNER
WILL
HAVE
A
CLEAR
ADVANTAGE
IT
WILL
BE
A
LOT
EASIER
TO
BUILD
MOMENTUM
AGAINST
A
TEAM
LIKE
THE
KINGS
WHOEVER
PLAYS
THE
KINGS
IN
THE
FIRST
ROUND
WILL
TAKE
THE
DIVISION
MUCH
AS
IT
HURTS
I
HAVE
TO
PICK
DIVISION
WINNER
VANCOUVER
CANUCKS
ILL
HAVE
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
ON
THIS
ONE
I
THINK
VANCOUVER
WILL
GO
AS
BURE
GOES
AND
IF
HE
CONTINUES
ON
HIS
GOAL
SCORING
SLUMP
THEN
THEY
WONT
EVEN
MAKE
IT
OUT
OF
THE
FIRST
ROUND
I
THINK
THE
KINGS
WILL
MAKE
IT
OUT
OF
THE
FIRST
ROUND
REGARDLESS
OF
WHO
THEY
PLAY
THEY
SEEM
TO
BE
DOING
PRETTY
WELL
EVEN
WITH
THAT
BAD
GAME
AGAINST
MINNESOTA
ON
SATURDAY
I
THINK
ITLL
BE
EITHER
CALGARY
OR
LOS
ANGELES
TO
WIN
THE
SMYTHE
IE
GO
ON
TO
THE
CONFERENCE
FINALS
WALES
CONFERENCE
TROPHY
ISLANDERS
AND
BRUINS
WILL
FIGHT
TO
THE
END
BUT
I
THINK
THE
ISLANDERS
HAVE
ENOUGH
STEAM
TO
OVERTAKE
THE
BRUINS
IN
SEVEN
CAMPBELL
CONFERENCE
TROPHY
A
WALK
FOR
VANCOUVER
MAYBE
IN
OR
BUT
DEFINATELY
NOT
STANLEY
CUP
FINAL
ISLANDERS
AND
VANCOUVER
ISLANDERS
WILL
HAVE
NOTHING
LEFT
BY
THIS
POINT
AND
WILL
SUCCUMB
FAIRLY
EASILY
TO
THE
CANUCKS
STANLEY
CUP
CHAMPION
VANCOUVER
CANUCKS
STILL
HAVE
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
I
THINK
ITLL
BE
PITTSBURG
TO
GET
THE
HAT
TRICK
IN
STANLEY
CUPS
THEY
JUST
LOOK
TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
GOOD
I
HOPE
YOU
HAVE
ENJOYED
MY
PREDICTIONS
I
HOPE
THEY
ARE
NOT
ALL
CORRECT
GO
CALGARY
NEITHER
DO
I
WELL
MAY
THE
BEST
TEAM
WIN
IT
ALL
PITTSBURG
THATS
JUST
MY
WORTH
MESSAGE
FROM
THE
TERMINAL
OF
