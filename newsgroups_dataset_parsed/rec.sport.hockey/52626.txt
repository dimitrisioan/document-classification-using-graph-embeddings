the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
xenophobic
trash
deleted
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
i
just
dont
want
them
on
mine
if
youre
going
to
go
to
those
extremes
i
guess
youd
better
start
packing
because
unless
youre
a
native
north
american
this
isnt
your
continent
either
