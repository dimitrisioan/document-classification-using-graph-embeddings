canada
does
not
have
the
restrictions
against
cubans
that
the
us
has
and
other
major
league
teams
have
told
the
canadian
teams
that
they
would
be
very
unhappy
if
the
expos
or
the
blue
jays
would
do
this
cubans
players
would
not
have
to
defect
to
play
in
canada
and
could
play
the
home
games
for
the
expos
and
blue
jays
without
any
