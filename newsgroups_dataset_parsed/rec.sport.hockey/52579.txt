before
i
begin
lambasting
don
cherry
let
me
first
say
that
ive
been
sort
of
a
cherry
fan
for
a
whileadmittedly
stuff
he
says
has
to
be
taken
lightly
but
hes
moreorless
harmless
on
saturday
however
he
crossed
the
lines
of
good
taste
according
to
don
the
entire
article
wasnt
perfect
and
there
were
some
shots
by
frank
musil
and
alpo
suhonen
don
noted
that
musil
wasnt
much
of
a
player
didnt
score
many
goals
last
year
he
also
made
fun
of
their
names
one
guy
has
a
name
like
dog
food
the
other
like
a
laxitive
metamusil
this
is
the
best
he
can
do
gee
don
tremendous
amounts
of
professionalism
here
the
cbc
looks
just
as
bad
as
he
looks
foolish
letting
him
get
away
with
this
nonsensemaking
fun
of
names
its
bad
enough
that
he
makes
asinine
blanket
statements
about
european
players
but
hes
now
resorted
to
making
fun
of
their
names
too
he
sounded
like
an
idiot
much
like
he
did
last
week
when
he
said
that
teemu
would
never
make
it
to
his
rock
em
sock
em
video
until
he
dropped
the
gloves
on
the
subject
of
realignment
don
said
that
he
liked
the
new
division
names
well
what
he
said
was
that
even
though
hes
been
around
the
league
for
quite
some
time
he
still
doesnt
know
whos
where
wrt
conference
and
division
names
hello
mcfly
the
names
have
been
around
for
a
couple
of
decades
or
sohe
also
invited
the
audience
to
name
the
teams
in
the
walesquick
quick
followed
by

this
one
ron

dont
know
wy

like
you
on
your
show
for
minutes
i
can
hardly
stand
you
on
this
show
for
this
was
absolutely
hilarious
dons
argument
about
the
basketball
and
baseball
brawls
was
fairly
goodunfortunately
he
neglected
to
mention
the
fines
that
were
levelled
in
the
nba
case
serious
moneyoh
well
hes
never
been
one
for
objectivity
has
he
dons
question
to
gretzky

it
be
better
for
you
to
change
your
friends
so
that
they
like
the
game
than
for
us

change
the
game
