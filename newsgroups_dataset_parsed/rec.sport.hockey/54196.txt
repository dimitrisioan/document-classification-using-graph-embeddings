does
anyone
recieve
annoying
email
from
roger
maynard
whenever
they
post
an
article
telling
them
to
leave
him
alon
and
stop
posting
to
the
group
these
emails
are
filled
with
insults
more
than
are
usual
in
rogers
posts
and
have
little
if
any
hockey
info
i
have
recieved
two
in
the
last
days
i
am
just
wondering
if
i
am
special
or
roger
trys
to
bully
everyone
who
disagrees
with
him
gregmeister
you
cant
be
serious
i
and
many
of
my
colleagues
have
not
received
any
bad
emails
from
roger
in
fact
roger
happens
to
have
answered
most
if
not
all
of
my
hockey
questions
and
curiosities
so
before
you
start
flaming
at
me
or
roger
better
reconsider
your
nasty
attitude
towards
roger
and
the
like
steve
lee
university
of
western
ontario
london
canada
speaking
of
roger
where
is
his
comments
from
last
nights
game
you
have
to
admit
he
can
make
a
nothing
game
sound
like
it
was
game
of
the
stanley
cup
finals
roger
pushes
the
leafs
so
much
it
even
bothers
me
a
long
time
supporter
but
he
does
have
a
good
overall
idea
of
the
game
wow
i
just
gave
rm
a
compliment
guess
i
better
stop
it
with
the
rye
water
before
i
give
him
another
