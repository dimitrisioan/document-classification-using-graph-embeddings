I
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
INCORRECT
ROGER
PATRICK
SMYTHE
AND
ADAMS
ALL
PLAYED
OR
COACHED
IN
THE
LEAGUE
BEFORE
BECOMING
FRONT
OFFICE
TYPES
HENCE
THEY
DID
HELP
BUILD
THE
LEAGUE
ALTHOUGH
THEY
WERE
NOT
GREAT
PLAYERS
THEMSELVES
PUNCH
IMLACHS
CONTRIBUTIONS
AS
A
COACH
AND
GM
WERE
FAR
GREATER
THAN
THOSE
OF
THE
ABOVE
COMBINED
SHOULD
WE
NAME
A
DIVISION
OR
TROPHY
AFTER
HIM
OWNER
VS
PLAYER
CONTRIBUTIONS
DELETED
ARE
WE
GOING
TO
HONOUR
THOSE
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
LEAGUES
EVOLUTION
OR
ARE
WE
GOING
TO
HONOUR
THOSE
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
SPORT
ITSELF
STUFF
DELETED
THE
MONEY
ISSUE
IS
IRRELEVANT
TO
THE
POINT
THAT
WE
WOULD
AGREE
ON
AND
THAT
IS
IT
IS
THE
PLAYERS
THAT
ARE
WHAT
MAKE
THE
GAME
GREAT
AND
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
PUT
THEM
ON
THE
ICE
AS
I
RECALL
THE
AUTHOR
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
ARTICLE
THAT
STARTED
THE
THREAD
CLAIMED
THAT
HE
DISLIKED
THE
CHANGING
OF
THE
NAMES
FOR
A
VARIETY
OF
REASONS
ROGER
ON
ONE
FRONT
YOU
FLAMED
HIM
RATHER
SEVERELY
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
HIS
WAS
A
JINGOISTIC
RANT
BUT
YOU
ALSO
SUPPORTED
THE
NAMECHANGING
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
THE
CURRENT
NAMES
ARE
INAPPROPRIATE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
INDIVIDUALS
THEY
REPRESENT
FWIW
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THE
FLAMING
WAS
WARRANTED
NOR
DO
I
THINK
YOU
ENHANCED
WHAT
CREDIBILITY
YOU
HAVE
WITH
IT
AT
ALL
JUST
AN
OBSERVATION
HOWEVER
THAT
ASIDE
THE
REAL
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
YOU
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
CHANGING
THE
NAMES
BASED
ON
THE
REASONS
GIVEN
FOR
IT
MAKING
IT
EASIER
FOR
THE
CASUAL
FAN
OR
WHETHER
YOU
LIKE
THE
IDEA
OF
UNIQUE
DIVISIONAL
NAMES
BASED
ON
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
DO
DESERVE
THE
HONOUR
IMO
THE
LATTER
IS
A
NICE
AND
UNIQUE
TOUCH
THAT
DIFFERS
FROM
OTHER
SPORTS
IN
ADDITION
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
CHANGING
DIVISIONAL
NAMES
WILL
HAVE
AN
EFFECT
ON
THE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
HOCKEY
SO
ITS
A
POINTLESS
EXERCISE
ANYWAY
IF
THE
CURRENT
NAMES
ARE
INAPPROPRIATE
THEN
THAT
IS
A
SEPARATE
ISSUE
NOT
CENTRAL
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
ARTICLE
SOMETHING
TO
CONSIDER
ADDITIONALLY
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
PLAYERS
LIKE
ORR
WHO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THE
GLORY
OF
THE
SPORT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
DO
SO
WITHOUT
AN
ORGANIZED
PROFESSIONAL
LEAGUE
TO
PLAY
IN
IN
THIS
CASE
HONOURING
BUILDERS
OF
THE
LEAGUE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
BUILDERS
OF
THE
SPORT
BECOMES
A
CHICKENANDEGG
TYPE
QUESTION
ALTHOUGH
IT
WAS
THE
CHICKEN
EXACTLY
TRUE
NAMING
DIVISIONS
AND
TROPHIES
AFTER
SMYTHE
AND
THE
BUNCH
IS
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
NEPOTISM
THAT
PUT
STEIN
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
WAS
NONSENSE
DUNNO
IF
THE
STEIN
COMPARISON
IS
JUSTIFIABLE
SINCE
IT
DOESNT
LOOK
AS
THOUGH
HIS
UNANIMOUS
ACCEPTANCE
TO
THE
HALL
WILL
HOLD
UP
