la
on
abc
in
canada
was
the
abc
coverage
of
the
kingsflames
game
supposed
to
be
the
way
it
was
shown
in
bc
with
cbc
overriding
the
abc
coverage
when
i
flipped
to
abc
it
was
the
same
commentators
same
commercials
even
my
question
is
was
this
the
real
abc
coverage
or
did
cbc
just
black
out
the
abc
coverage
for
its
own
comment
cbc
had
a
great
chance
for
some
double
headers
torontodetroit
and
vancouverwinnipeg
but
today
they
said
that
the
east
gets
the
leafs
and
the
west
get
the
vancouver
game
i
thought
that
they
would
show
them
both
the
godfather
