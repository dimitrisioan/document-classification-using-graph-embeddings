HAVE
BEEN
TO

COMPLAINERS
ABOUT
THIS
GAME
THAT
ITS
MAKING
ME
SICK
GENERALLY
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HOWEVER
LAST
NIGHT
ESPN
CUT
AWAY
TO
BASEBALL
TONITE
WHICH
LOOKS
LIKE
SPORTSCENTER
TAILORED
TO
BASEBALL
AND
THEY
CUT
AWAY
AT
PACIFIC
THATS
QUITE
A
CONTRACT
THEY
HAVE
THERE
IF
ESPN
COULDNT
DELIVER
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
HAD
A
TRANSISTION
PLAN
TO
LET
SPORTSCHANNEL
PICK
UP
THE
SLACK
NONETHELESS
IT
IS
ULTIMATELY
THE
FAULT
OF
THE
USAMERICAN

HAS
PRECEDENCE
OVER

SUPPORT
YOUR
TEAM
SUPPORT
YOUR

SOMEBODY
IN

HAD
AN
EXCELLENT
IDEA
THAT
WE
SHOULD
WRITE
CHRYSLER

THANK
THEM
FOR
SUPPORTING
HOCKEY
WITH
THEIR
ADS
AND
THAT
WE
WOULD
CONSIDER
THEIR
PRODUCTS
HERES
AN
EQUALLY
EXCELLENT
IDEA
WATCH
BASEBALL
FOR
MINUTES
I
KNOW
IM
ASKING
A
LOT
BUT
THATS
WHAT
SPEW
BAGS
ARE
FOR
WRITE
DOWN
WHO
IS
ADVERTISING
AND
WRITE
THEM
LETTERS
COMPLAINING
THAT
THEY
ARE
SUPPORTING
BASEBALL
TO
YOUR
DISPLEASURE
AND
THAT
YOU
WONT
CONSIDER
BUYING
THEIR
PRODUCTS
BECAUSE
OF
IT
MIKE
EISLER
MREENGSUNCOM
NOT
ONLY
ARE
THEY
LEAFS
THE
BEST
TEAM
BUT
THEIR
FANS
ARE
EVEN
MORE
INTELLIGENT
AND
INSIGHTFUL
THAN
PITTSBURGHS
THEIR
PLAYERS
ARE
MIGHTY
