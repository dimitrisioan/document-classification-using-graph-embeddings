TOO
MANY

IN

RICHARD
JOHN
RAUSER
WRITES
HERES
THE
POINT
THERE
ARE
FAR
TOO
MANY
EUROPEANS
IN
THE
NHL
I
AM
SICK
OF
WATCHING
A
GAME
BETWEEN
AN
AMERICAN
AND
A
CANADIAN
TEAM
LETS
SAY
THE
RED
WINGS
AND
THE
CANUCKS
AND
SEEING
NAMES
LIKE
BURE
KONSTANTINOV
AND
BORSHEVSHKY
IS
THIS
NORTH
AMERICA
OR
ISNT
IT
TORONTO
DETRIOT
QUEBEC
AND
EDMONTON
ARE
PARTICULARLY
ANNOYING
BUT
THE
NUMBERS
OF
EUROS
ON
OTHER
TEAMS
IS
GETTING
WORSE
AS
WELL
GEE
YOUD
THINK
WINNIPEG
WOULD
BE
TOPS
ON
THAT
LIST
WHAT
WITH
REGULARS
BEING
EUROPEAN
I
LIVE
IN
VANCOUVER
AND
IF
I
HEAR
ONE
MORE
WORD
ABOUT
PAVEL
BURE
THE
RUSSIAN
ROCKET
I
WILL
COMPLETELY
THROW
UP
AS
IT
IS
NOW
EVERY
TIME
I
SEE
THE
CANUCKS
PLAY
I
KEEP
HOPING
SOMEONE
WILL
CROSSCHECK
BURE
INTO
THE
PLEXIGLASSSO
HARD
THEY
HAVE
TO
CARRY
HIM
OUT
ON
A
STRETCHER
BY
THE
WAY
IM
NOT
A
CANUCKS
FAN
TO
BEGIN
WITH
WELL
BEING
A
JET
FAN
I
SOMETIMES
WISH
THAT
BURE
WOULD
GET
KNOCKED
SILLY
TOO
NOTHING
SERIOUS
JUST
ENOUGH
TO
KEEP
HIM
OUT
OF
A
GAME
OKAY
THE
STRETCHER
REMARK
WAS
A
LITTLE
CARRIED
AWAY
BUT
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
I
RESENT
NHL
OWNERS
DRAFTING
ALL
THESE
EUROPEANS
INSTEAD
OF
CANADIANS
AND
SOME
AMERICANS
IT
DENIES
YOUNG
CANADIANS
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
PLAY
IN
THEIR
NORTH
AMERICAN
LEAGUE
AND
INSTEAD
GIVES
IT
TO
EUROPEANS
WHO
ARENT
EVEN
BETTER
HOCKEY
PLAYERS
ITS
ALL
HYPE
THIS
EUROPEAN
MYSTIQUE
IS
SICKENING
BUT
UNTIL
NHL
OWNERS
GET
OVER
IT
CANADIAN
AND
AMERICAN
PLAYERS
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
HAVE
TO
FIGHT
HARDER
TO
GET
DRAFTED
INTO
THEIR
OWN
LEAGUE
IN
MOST
CASES
THE
OWNERS
HAVE
VERY
LITTLE
TO
DO
WITH
IT
THEY
GIVE
THEIR
GENERAL
MANAGERS
ONE
ORDER
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
THE
DRAFTFIND
ME
THE
BEST
PLAYERS
SO
THAT
OUR
TEAM
WILL
WIN
THE
STANLEY
CUP
WHETHER
THAT
PLAYER
IS
IN
KINDERSLEY
SASKATCHEWAN
OR
CHELYABINSK
RUSSIA
IF
THE
GM
BELIEVES
HIM
TO
BE
THE
BETTER
PLAYER
THE
GM
SHOULD
BE
DRAFTING
HIM
WHERE
DO
YOU
GET
OFF
CALLING
THE
NHL
THEIR
LEAGUE
WHEN
REFERRING
TO
CANADIAN
PLAYERS
IT
DOESNT
BELONG
TO
THEM
IT
BELONGS
TO
THE
OWNERS
THE
OWNERS
CAN
DO
WHAT
THEY
WANT
WHILE
A
CANADIAN
CONTENT
RULE
MIGHT
BE
ENFORCABLE
HERE
IN
CANADA
THERE
IS
ENOUGH
DOUBT
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
ENFORCABLE
IN
THE
US
THAT
THE
CFL
SORRY
FOR
THE
FOOTBALL
REFERENCE
DIDNT
EVEN
TRY
TO
PUSH
THEIR
IMPORT
RATIO
RULE
ON
THE
SACROMENTO
GOLDMINERS
INCREASING
THE
COMPETITION
FOR
THE
ELITE
POSITIONS
IN
MOST
CASES
WOULD
MAKE
PLAYERS
BETTER
ANYWAYS
OH
YEAH
AND
HOW
MANY
EUROPEANS
PLAY
AT
THE
LOWER
LEVELS
OF
PROFESSIONAL
HOCKEY
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
WHILE
THERE
ARE
SOME
THAT
PLAY
IN
THE
AHL
OR
THE
IHL
WHERE
THATS
AN
NHL
TEAMS
PRIMARY
FARM
CLUB
YOU
DONT
HEAR
OF
MANY
EUROPEANS
PLAYING
IN
THE
CHL
THE
ECHL
OR
ON
THE
SECONDARY
FARM
TEAMS
IN
THE
IHL
IE
THE
JETS
DO
HAVE
A
FEW
RUSSIAN
PLAYERS
IN
MONCTON
BUT
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THERE
ARE
ANY
EUROPEANS
IN
FT
WAYNE
SO
WITH
ALL
THOSE
TEAMS
THERE
ARE
PLENTY
OF
POSITIONS
FOR
HOCKEY
PLAYERS
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
WITH
THE
NUMBERS
OF
EUROS
IN
THE
NHL
ESCALATING
THE
PROBLEM
IS
CLEARLY
ONLY
GETTING
WORSE
IM
ALL
FOR
THE
CREATION
OF
A
EUROPEAN
HOCKEY
LEAGUE
AND
LET
THE
BURES
AND
SELANNES
OF
THE
WORLD
PLAY
ON
THEIR
OWN
CONTINENT
I
JUST
DONT
WANT
THEM
ON
MINE
IM
IN
FAVOUR
OF
THE
NHL
BEING
THE
LEAGUE
FOR
THE
PREMIER
PLAYERS
IN
THE
WORLD
IVE
GROWN
UP
WITH
EUROPEANS
PLAYING
ON
MY
TEAM
AND
SOME
OF
THOSE
PLAYERS
WERE
THE
AMONG
THE
BEST
IN
THE
WORLD
FROM
HEDBERG
NILSSON
AND
SJOBERG
TO
SELNNE
ZHAMNOV
AND
OLAUSSON
AND
ALL
THOSE
IN
BETWEEN
AND
TO
COME
