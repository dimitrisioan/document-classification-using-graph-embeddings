TO
UTTER
THE
WORD
WITHOUT
BEING
EXTREMELY
SICK
AND
PISSED

A
STUNTMAN
AFTER

HOST
JERRY
LEWIS
BY
THE
WAY
I
AM
CANADIAN
PLAY
A
LITTLE
AND
WATCHED
HOCKEY
NIGHT
IN
CANADA
NEVER
MISSED
A
SHOW
NOT
ONE
OF
THESE

MY
HOME
TEAM

I
WAS
A
HOCKEY
FAN
FOR
TEN
MINUTES
NOW
GIVE

A
FKING
BREAK
WITH
THIS
MARIO
IS
THE
BEST
PLAYER
EVER
WHAT

TO
DO
WITH
A
WHOUSE
LIKE
MARIO

THE
PUCK
NOT
THAT
I
CONDONE
VIOLENCE
BUT
ILL
MAKE
AN
EXCEPTION
FOR
MARIO
BUT
IF
MARIO
IS
GOING
TO
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
BEING
HIT
SOMEONE
SHOULD
GIVE
HIM
AND
SCOTTY
SOMETHING
REAL
TO
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
SORRY
TO
RAMBLE
AS
YOU
CAN
SEE
I
HATE
MARIO
PAT
WALKER
UNB
YOU
ALONG
WITH
MARIO
LEMIEUX
MUST
BE
FROM
ANOTHER
PLANET
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
LEMIEUX
COMES
FROM
THE
ONE
WITH
GEO
WASHINGTON
ABE
LINCOLN
AND
MANY
OTHER
GREAT
MEN
AND
WOMEN
OF
THIS
WORLD
WHEREAS
YOU
COME
FROM
THE
ONE
WITH
DAVID
KORESH
YEAH
MARIO
IS
GOOD
AT
DRAWING
PENALTIES
BUT
WOULDNT
YOU
TRY
DO
SOMETHING
YOU
DO
CLAIM
TO
PLAY
TO
GIVE
YOUR
TEAM
AN
ADVANTAGE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
LEMIEUX
GETTING
ANY
DIVING
PENALTIES
THIS
YEAR
WHEREAS
MANY
OTHERS
DID
FINALLY
MARIO
HAS
NEVER
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
BEING
HIT
HE
KNOWS
ITS
PART
OF
THE
GAME
HE
GETS
BACK
BY
DISHING
OUT
AN
EVEN
BIGGER
HIT
TO
THE
SAME
GUY
OR
JUST
SCORING
A
FEW
GOALS
OR
SETTING
THEM
UP
DONT
YOU
HAVE
ANY
COMPASSION
FOR
A
MAN
WHO
HAS
GONE
THROUGH
SO
MUCH
IN
HIS
LIFE
