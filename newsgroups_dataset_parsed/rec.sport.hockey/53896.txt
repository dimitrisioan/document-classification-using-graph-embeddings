CHARLES

WRITES
TUESDAY
AND
THE

IS
GOING
INTO
OVERTIME
WHAT
DOES
ESPN
DO
TOM
MEES
SAYS
WE
ARE
OBLIGATED
TO
BRING
YOU
BASEBALL
WERE
PROBABLY
STUCK
AS
MIKE
BURGER
POINTED
OUT
THAT
THE
BASEBALL
DEAL
WAS
MADE
FAR
IN
ADVANCE
OF
THE
NHL
CONTRACT
WABC
DID
THE
SAME
THING
THEY
WERE
THANKFUL
THAT
THE
DEVILS
WERE
WIPED
OUT
BY
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
TO
SWITCH
OVER
TO
YANKEES
BASEBALL
THE
PROOF
OF
THE
REASONS
FOR
THIS
IS
LEFT
TO
THE
READER
ITS
TOO
BAD
BUT
I
WONDER
IF
ESPN
IS
STUCK
WITH
OTHER
US
LOCAL
TEAM
COVERAGE
FOR
THEIR
ALTERNATE
GAMES
WE
GOT
NESNS
COVERAGE
OF
THE
BRUINSSABRES
WITH
THE
BOSTON
HOMERS
THEY
WERE
AWFUL
IVE
READ
THAT
DEREK
SANDERSON
IS
THE
COLOUR
ANALYST
I
WONDER
IF
HE
SPENT
HIS
EARLY
YEARS
AFTER
HOCKEY
AS
AN
INTERN
AT
PRAVDA
BEFORE
LANDING
THIS
JOB
EVERYTHING
HAD
TO
BE
TWISTED
INTO
SOMETHING
GOOD
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THE
BRUINS
INVOLVED
NOT
EVEN
BILL
WIRTZS
SHILLS
ON
SC
CHICAGO
PAT
FOLEY
DALE
TALLON
WERE
THIS
BAD
AND
JUST
TO
BE
FAIR
SC
USED
TO
TAKE
THEIR
FEED
FROM
ESN
EMPIRE
SPORTS
NETWORK
THE
SABRE
HOMERS
AND
THEY
WERE
HORRIBLE
TOO
BUT
THEY
WERE
SPACY
FROM
THE
CNN
HIGHLIGHTS
I
HEAR
CHRIS
CUTHBERTS
VOICE
FROM
THE
CBC
COVERAGE
OF
THE
HABSNORDS
SERIES
TOO
BAD
THAT
WE
COULDNT
GET
IT
ON
ESPN
WITH
ALL
DUE
RESPECT
TO
THE
SABRES
AND
THE
BRUINS
MIKE
