RE
NHL
LETTER
QUITE
LONG
IN
CATCHERNETCOMCOM
PAUL
W
FRANCISCO
WRITES
AS
SHE
SAID
THE
LETTER
IS
ADDRESSED
TO
BETTMAN
THE
POST
WHICH
THOUGH
HAVING
PRETTY
MUCH
THE
SAME
CONTENT
IS
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
ENTITY
WAS
ADDRESSED
TO
ALL
WHEN
SHE
PUTS
THE
LETTER
IN
THE
MAIL
I
DOUBT
IT
WILL
SAY
TO
ALL
I
FIGURE
SHE
WANTED
TO
LET
PEOPLE
HERE
SEE
WHAT
WAS
IN
IT
SINCE
IT
IS
A
TOPIC
THAT
INTERESTS
A
LOT
OF
FOLKS
HERE
THATS
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
PURPOSE
THAN
SENDING
THE
LETTER
TO
BETTMAN
AND
IT
IS
A
DAMN
GOOD
THING
THAT
SHE
DID
POST
IT
SINCE
SHE
CLAIMS
TO
REPRESENT
PEOPLE
IN
RECSPORTHOCKEY
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
LARGEST
COMPUTER
NETWORKS
IN
THE
WORLD
PHRASE
IS
A
DEFINITION
OF
THE
INTERNET
NOT
A
GROUP
AS
A
WHOLE
THAT
SHE
CLAIMS
TO
REPRESENT
AS
HER
SOLE
PURPOSE
IN
MENTIONING
THE
NET
AS
STEVE
GALLICHIO
HAS
ALREADY
POINTED
OUT
IS
TO
LEND
WEIGHT
TO
HER
POINTS
THROUGH
ASSOCIATION
WITH
THE
INTERNET
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
REASON
TO
MENTION
THE
INTERNET
THIS
IS
MISREPRESENTATION
AND
IF
THE
INTERNET
WAS
A
PRIVATE
CORPORATION
ALISON
WOULD
BE
LEAVING
HERSELF
WIDE
OPEN
TO
ALL
KINDS
OF
CIVIL
SUITS
FOR
THE
BUSINESS
OF
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
IS
LARGE
IT
IS
LARGE
COMPARED
TO
SAY
THE
NUMBER
OF
FOLKS
ON
RSH
WHO
ARE
SENDING
A
LETTER
TO
THANK
HIM
FOR
CHANGING
THE
NAMES
AT
LEAST
TO
THIS
POINT
AND
JUST
FOR
MY
THIS
IS
NOT
A
LETTER
IT
IS
A
PETITION
CLAIMING
TO
REPRESENT
A
LARGE
PROPORTION
OF
RECSPORTHOCKEY
USERS
AND
BY
IMPLICATION
A
SIGNIFICANT
NUMBER
OF
INTERNET
USERS
NAMES
CAN
IN
NO
WAY
BE
CONSIDERED
A
LARGE
PROPORTION
OF
RECSPORTHOCKEY
WHICH
WHILE
WE
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
COUNTING
ACTUAL
READERSHIP
IS
ACCESSIBLE
TO
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
PEOPLE
PERSONS
IS
NO
MORE
THAN
A
FLYS
FART
IN
A
WINDSTORM
OWN
CURIOSITY
I
THOUGHT
ID
LOOK
UP
THE
OFFICIAL
DEFINITION
OF
LARGE
IN
THE
DICTIONARY
IT
READS
LARGE
HAVING
MORE
THAN
USUAL
POWER
CAPACITY
OR
SCOPE
EXCEEDING
MOST
OTHER
THINGS
OF
LIKE
KIND
IN
QUANTITY
OR
SIZE
GEE
YOU
LOOKED
UP
LARGE
IN
THE
DICTIONARY
WHAT
NEXT
TWO
SYLLABLE
WORDS
NOW
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
MANY
LETTERS
BETTMAN
MAY
HAVE
GOTTEN
ON
THE
ISSUE
OR
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
MAY
HAVE
SIGNED
THEM
PEOPLE
MAY
BE
UP
THERE
THEREBY
VALIDATING
DEFINITION
I
WOULD
ALSO
WAGER
THAT
THE
GEOGRAPHICAL
RANGE
OF
SIGNATURES
IS
QUITE
LARGE
WHICH
WOULD
GIVE
IT
A
LARGE
SCOPE
LET
ME
SUGGEST
THAT
THE
ONLY
PLACE
YOU
ARE
LIKELY
TO
ENVY
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
IS
WHEN
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
WAYS
TO
BEEF
UP
YOUR
IQ
SCORES
HE
MIGHT
BE
IMPRESSED
BY
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
LIST
OF
NAMES
WHY
WOULD
HE
BE
IMPRESSED
WITH
THIS
UNLESS
IT
WERE
LARGE
AS
I
SAID
HE
MIGHT
BE
IMPRESSED
BY
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
LIST
OF
NAMES
BUT
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
CONSIDERABLY
LARGER
BUT
EVEN
THIS
DEFINITION
DOES
NOT
ACCOUNT
FOR
THE
ORIGINAL
CONTEXT
FROM
WHICH
YOU
LIFTED
THIS
SENTENCE
I
PERSONALLY
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
OR
NOT
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
LETTER
I
HAVE
VERY
MIXED
EMOTIONS
ABOUT
IT
I
LIKE
THE
NAMES
AS
THEY
ARE
AND
DONT
THINK
THEY
MAKE
IT
THAT
DIFFICULT
TO
LEARN
THE
GAME
BUT
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
SHRED
OF
VALIDITY
TO
THE
CHANGE
WELL
THEN
WHAT
THE
HELL
IS
YOUR
POINT
YOU
DONT
REALLY
KNOW
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
OPINION
ABOUT
THE
HOCKEY
ISSUE
BUT
YOU
DO
KNOW
THAT
YOU
DONT
LIKE
ME
IS
THAT
IT
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
SO
MANY
MORONS
RM
AND
SO
LITTLE
TIME
