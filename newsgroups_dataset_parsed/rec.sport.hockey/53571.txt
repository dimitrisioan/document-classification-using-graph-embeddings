GREG
BALLENTINE
WRITES
GAINEY
IS
THE
BEST
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
EVER
I
STAND
BY
THAT
ASSESSMENT
HE
WAS
A
VERY
GOOD
PLAYER
WHO
BELONGS
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
DID
YOU
EVER
WATCH
HIM
PLAY
HE
NEVER
MADE
A
TECHNICAL
ERROR
I
WATCHED
HIM
OVER
HIS
ENTIRE
CAREER
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
A
PLAYER
AND
THAT
INCLUDES
RUSSELL
COURTNALL
AND
DAVIE
KEON
SCREW
UP
AS
MANY
BREAKAWAYS
AS
BOB
GAINEY
AND
I
WILL
NEVER
FORGET
THE
TIME
DENIS
POTVIN
CAUGHT
GAINEY
WITH
HIS
HEAD
DOWN
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
SOLD
A
BILL
OF
GOODS
ON
BOB
GAINEY
GAINEY
WAS
A
PLUGGER
AND
WHEN
THE
PRESS
RUNS
OUT
OF
THINGS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
THE
STARS
ON
DYNASTIES
THEY
START

HYPE

SO
ON
THESE
PLAYERS
ALL
ARE
PRETTY
GOOD
PLAYERS
THEY
ARE
THE
DEPTH
THAT
THE
DYNASTIES
HAD
TO
WIN
STANLEY
CUPS
THEY
TEND
TO
BE
THE
VERY
GOOD
SECOND
LINE
GUYS
WHO
WOULD
BE
FIRST
LINERS
ON
MOST
WEAKER
CLUBS
IN
THE
NHL
THEY
WERE
ALL
IMPORTANT
TO
THEIR
CLUBS
PROBABLY
SEVERAL
OF
THESE
STANLEY
CUP
WINNING
TEAMS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
WON
THE
CUPS
THEY
DID
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
FOR
THE
DEPTH
PROVIDED
BY
THESE
PLAYERS
THEY
COMPARE
TO
RICK
TOCCHET
AND
RON
FRANCIS
OF
THE
PENGUINS
VERY
GOOD
PLAYERS
WHO
CAN
LEAD
LESSER
TEAMS
FRANCISHARTFORD
TOCCHETPHILLY
WHO
PROVIDE
THE
DEPTH
TO
THE
TEAM
THAT
IS
CURRENTLY
BEST
IN
THE
NHL
AS
A
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
NONE
BETTER
THAN
BOB
GAINEY
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
HE
WAS
THE
BEST
PLAYER
OR
EVEN
THE
BEST
FORWARD
THE
CANADIANS
HAD
AT
THAT
TIME
BUT
HE
WAS
EXCELLENT
AT
WHAT
HE
DID
GAINEY
COULD
DOMINATE
GAMES
WITH
HIS
DEFENCE
HE
DIDNT
NEED
TO
GET
GOALS
TO
DOMINATE
HE
SHUT
DOWN
THE
OPPOSITION
AND
WAS
THUS
VALUABLE
THERE
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
ANYONE
ANY
BETTER
AT
DOING
THIS
NOT
EVER
