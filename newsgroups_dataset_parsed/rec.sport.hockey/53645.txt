WRITES
ARE
PEOPLE
HERE
STUPID
OR
WHAT
IT
IS
A
TIE
BREAKER
OF
CAUSE
THEY
HAVE
TO
HAVE
THE
SAME
RECORD
HOW
CAN
PEOPLE
BE
SOOOOO
STUPPID
TO
PUT
WIN
AS
FIRST
IN
THE
LIST
FOR
TIE
BREAKER
IF
IT
IS
A
TIE
BREAKER
HOW
CAN
THERE
BE
DIFFERENT
RECORD
MAN
I
THOUGHT
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
NET
ARE
GOOD
WITH
HOCKEY
I
MIGHT
NOT
BE
GREAT
IN
MATH
BUT
TELL
ME
HOW
CAN
TWO
TEAMS
AHVE
THE
SAME
POINTS
WITH
DIFFERENT
RECORD
MANRETARD
CANT
BELIEVE
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
PUT
WIN
AS
FIRST
IN
A
TIE
BREAKER
GOLLY
I
LOVE
STUPID
PEOPLE
LISTEN
REX
THIS
IS
HOCKEY
THE
NHL
TO
BE
PRECISE
AND
IN
THE
NHL
THERE
EXIST
THESE
THINGS
CALLED
TIES
A
TIE
OCCURS
WHEN
A
GAME
ENDS
WITH
THE
SCORE
FOR
EACH
TEAM
EQUAL
EACH
TEAM
GETS
ONE
POINT
FOR
A
TIE
THERE
ALSO
EXITS
THESE
THINGS
CALLED
WINS
A
WIN
IS
WHEN
ONE
TEAM
HAS
A
HIGHER
SCORE
THAN
THE
OPPONENT
OH
YEAH
ONLY
TWO
TEAMS
PLAY
EACH
OTHER
AT
A
TIME
SO
I
CAN
SAY
THE
OPPONENT
A
TEAM
GETS
TWO
POINTS
FOR
A
WIN
SO
LETS
SAY
THAT
A
TEAM
HAS
A
RECORD
OF
WINS
LOSSES
AND
TIES
ANOTHER
TEAM
HAS
A
RECORD
OF
WINS
LOSSES
AND
TIES
THE
FIRST
TEAM
HAS
POINTS
THE
SECOND
TEAM
HAS
POINTS
WOW
THEY
BOTH
HAVE
THE
SAME
NUMBER
OF
POINTS
BUT
THE
NUMBER
OF
WINS
IS
DIFFERENT
HOW
DID
THEY
DO
THAT
THATS
AMAZING
SO
REX
WHEN
PEOPLE
TALK
ABOUT
WINS
BEING
THE
FIRST
TIEBREAKER
WELL
THEN
THATS
WHAT
IT
MEANS
IN
OUR
EXAMPLE
THE
SECOND
TEAM
WOULD
WIN
THE
TIEBREAKER
AND
THEREFORE
HAVE
THE
BETTER
RECORD
EVEN
THOUGH
BOTH
TEAMS
HAD
THE
SAME
NUMBER
OF
POINTS
IF
YOU
DIDNT
UNDERSTAND
THIS
POST

MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
GO
