the
leafs
overcame
the
red
wings
in
what
was
possibly
the
most
exciting
game
played
yet
in
this
playoff
year
potvin
was
solid
and
wendel
completely
dominated
probert
gilmour
as
usual
was
the
best
player
on
the
ice
and
to
those
who
claim
that
andreychuk
fades
in
the
playoffs
please
take
note
andreychuk
is
averaging
a
goal
a
game
stars
andreychuk
goals
wendel
all
over
probert
probert
all
over
everyone
else
todd
gill
also
played
an
excellent
game
we
cant
say
enough
about
doug
gilmour
when
he
is
right
all
is
well
gilmour
brings
to
mind
davey
keon
from
the
previous
leaf
dynasty
predictions
so
far
on
track
nyi
over
buffalo
and
leafs
over
la
kings
leafs
over
nyi
in
the
final
i
cant
let
this
pass
if
the
islanders
get
past
pitts
assuming
the
isles
beat
the
caps
god
willing
them
im
sorry
the
isles
will
crush
the
leafs
flame
shields
up
of
course
no
one
asked
me
i
always
interject
my
opinions
on
matters
i
have
no
concern
over
go
islanders
down
to
go
go
jets
for
cordially
as
always
