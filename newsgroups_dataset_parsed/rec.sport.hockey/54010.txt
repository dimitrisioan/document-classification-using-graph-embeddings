im
just
wondering
where
all
the
bruins
fans
are
i
mean
they
woofed
it
up
with
about
posts
during
the
regular
season
saying
that
their
fave
team
was
going
to
kick
everyones
in
the
playoffs
and
win
the
stanley
oh
really
i
seem
to
remember
this
years
woofers
consisting
mainly
of
yourself
and
roger
boston
fans
were
relatively
quiet
cup
while
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
a
little
ranting
and
raving
im
just
curious
why
all
the
boston
faithful
have
stopped
posting
i
mean
i
havent
even
see
just
one
little
boston
fan
post
cept
for
the
bruins
fans
that
arent
cocky
i
guess
the
concept
of
a
fan
who
is
not
cocky
is
something
you
couldnt
possible
understand
eh
but
i
dont
know
id
sure
like
to
see
where
all
those
bruins
fans
are

doubt
you

youre
just
being
a
provocative
sob
as
usual
with
a
large
stick
up
your
but
of
course
i
mean
that
in
the
nicest
way
and
just
how
much
bragging

you
