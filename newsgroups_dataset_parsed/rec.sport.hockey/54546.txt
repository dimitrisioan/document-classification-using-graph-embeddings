who
should
get
the
hart
gretzky
not
in
a
million
years
at
least
not
this
year
he
hasnt
played
all
year
yzerman
though
it
would
be
nice
i
dont
think
hell
get
it
hes
consistent
but
not
well
known
thought
he
should
be
mario
jesus
no
its
bad
enough
for
me
just
to
utter
the
word
without
being
extremely
sick
and
pissed
off
they
guys
a
luber
to
ramble
as
you
can
see
i
hate
mario
pat
walker
unb
im
not
going
to
bother
reprinting
your
pathetic
excuse
for
a
post
mario
fan
or
not
you
have
to
respect
what
he
can
do
with
a
blade
as
for
the
hart
trophy
i
guess
winning
the
scoring
title
after
being
out
twentyfour
days
with
cancer
then
leading
his
team
to
the
presidents
trophy
and
breaking
the
win
streak
record
in
the
process
shouldnt
even
qualify
him
for
the
award
maybe
next
year
hell
tend
a
few
games
when
barrasso
needs
a
rest
be
realistic
mario
has
earned
every
one
of
his
accolades
and
deserves
all
the
attention
that
he
gets
lose
the
jealous
attitude
and
you
may
start
enjoying
hockey
at
its
finest
maze
