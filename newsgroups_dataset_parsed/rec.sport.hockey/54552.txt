the
probability
is
that
the
oilers
are
not
going
anywhere
gerald
look
at
what
happened
to
the
stars
they
are
off
to
dallas
pocklington
has
chosen
this
moment
to
make
his
last
stand
is
because
he
is
at
the
moment
of
maximum
advantagethe
provincial
government
is
months
away
from
a
provincial
electionit
is
the
moment
when
he
has
maximum
power
to
convince
northlands
to
give
him
a
better
arena
deal
or
a
better
purchase
price
and
it
is
before
the
nhls
new
collective
agreement
with
the
players
which
might
involve
some
enhanced
revenuesharing
gerald
the
alberta
election
is
slated
fou
june
unless
something
really
goes
wrong
this
time
pocklington
could
end
up
being
the
embarassment
of
klein
if
he
goes
ahead
with
his
ultimatum
pocklington
is
many
thingsstupid
is
not
one
of
them
gerald
people
still
have
an
axe
to
grind
with
this
guy
i
cannot
see
him
staying
for
long
he
can
dictate
termsbecause
other
cities
will
pay
his
price
if
edmonton
doesnt
but
the
people
in
edmonton
wont
budge
trust
me
on
this
one
edmonton
has
already
up
its
international
airport
and
surrendered
supremacy
to
calgary
and
over
the
next
few
years
edmonton
is
going
to
take
a
hard
hit
from
government
cutbacks
it
will
screw
itself
beyond
recogniton
if
it
manages
to
find
a
way
to
lose
its
hockey
team
toobecause
northlands
wants
to
continue
to
use
the
oilers
to
subsidize
horse
racing
northlands
wont
budge
ccording
to
one
of
the
board
members
bruce
campbell
however
in
this
case
about
the
longterm
financial
viability
of
the
oilers
the
fact
is
that
pocklington
is
basically
right
regardless
of
who
owns
the
team
and
it
is
right
to
provoke
the
crisis
now
before
the
team
accumulates
millions
of
dollars
in
losses
or
becomes
habitually
uncompetitive
because
of
lack
of
money
i
havent
heard
anything
but
attendance
at
the
coliseum
was
the
lowest
this
year
hinthint
remeber
what
i
said
about
a
personal
vendetta
sather
has
done
his
jobthe
oilers
are
poised
to
be
competitive
again
very
soon

strachan
one
of
the
most
knowledgeble
hockey
writers
in
canada
in
a
postmortem
of
the
oilers
season
in
the
globe
and
mail
recently
agrees
with
me
gerald
dont
blame
sather
this
battle
between
the
peole
and
pocklington
started
in
and
got
worst
when
pocklington
sold
gretzky
there
were
days
when
you
can
shake
the
hand
of
pocklington
when
he
was
respectalbe
i
use
to
do
so
in
season
but
those
days
are
