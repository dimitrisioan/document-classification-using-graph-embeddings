BRETT
BALL
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
I
FOR
ONE
AM
HAPPY
ABOUT
THE
RANGERS
HIRING
OF
KEENAN
ITS
TOO
BAD
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
HIRE
HIM
WHEN
SMITH
FIRED
NIELSEN
MAYBE
HE
COULD
OF
STAIGHTENED
OUT
THE
BABIES
ON
THIS
TEAM
AND
MADE
THE
PLAYOFFS
WHAT
THIS
TEAM
NEEDS
IS
A
LITTLE
FIRE
UNDER
THEIR
BUTTS
READING
THROUGH
MOST
OF
THESE
HOCKEY
NEWS
I
DONT
SEE
MANY
RANGER
FANS
WRITING
IM
NEW
TO
THIS
SYSTEM
AND
A
BIG
HOCKEY
FAN
AND
A
LONG
RANGER
FAN
BUT
REMEMBER
SUFFERING
BUILDS
CHARACTER
I
HAVE
SOME
FINAL
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
WAY
THE
TEAM
WAS
HANDLED
IN
THAT
LAST
DREADFUL
STRETCH
KNOWING
THEY
NEEDED
OFFENSIVE
HELP
FROM
THE
BLUELINE
WHY
DIDNT
WE
SEE
MIKE
HURLBUT
WHO
PLAYED
PRETTY
WELL
WHEN
HE
WAS
CALLED
UP
WHEN
LEETCH
FIRST
WENT
DOWN
WHY
IS
JOE
KOCUR
PLAYING
EVERY
NIGHT
HE
IS
NOT
BOB
PROBERT
WHO
IS
TOUGH
BUT
ALSO
CAN
PLAY
HOW
COME
PAUL
BROTEN
IS
RELEGATED
TO
STREET
CLOTHES
FOR
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
AT
LEAST
HE
PLAYS
WITH
SOME
HEART
AND
CHARACTER
DRAWS
PENALTIES
AND
PLAYS
WHEN
HES
ON
THE
ICE
WAS
HE
IN
THE
DOGHOUSE
FOR
SOME
REASON
JOE
CIRELLA
ENOUGH
SAID
RANGER
FANS
MAY
BE
SUFFERING
BUT
WERE
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
LOYAL
UNLIKE
ISLANDER
FANS
WHO
ONLY
SHOW
UP
WHEN
THE
TEAM
WINS
AS
FAR
AS
THE
STANLEY
CUP
GOES
I
THINK
THERES
ONLY
ONE
TEAM
THAT
CAN
TEST
PITTSBURGH
AND
THATS
DETROIT
THIS
WOULD
BE
THE
MOST
ENTERTAINING
AND
HARD
FOUGHT
SERIES
MARIO
IS
AMAZING
KURT
I
THINK
JOE
KOCUS
SHOULD
PLAY
EVERY
NIGHT
HE
IS
A
BIG
PHYSICAL
GUY
AND
HE
GETS
THE
FANS
INTO
THE
GAME
WITH
SOME
BIG
HITS
BOTH
CHECKS
AND
FISTS
ITS
A
BIG
ADVANTAGE
TO
GET
THE
CROWD
GOING
PLUS
HE
HELPS
PROTECT
THE
OTHER
PLAYERS
NOTICE
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
FIGHTS
WHEN
KOCUR
IS
ON
THE
ICE
UNLESS
HE
IS
IT
I
HAVE
SEEN
PEOPLE
START
TO
GO
AFTER
ESSA
TIKKANEN
ONLY
TO
GO
SLINKING
AWAY
WHEN
KOCUR
STEPS
IN
I
THINK
HE
IS
BIG
ASSET
BUT
SHOULD
BE
THIRD
LINE
AND
SPECIAL
SITUATION
ONLY
PLAY
THIS
IS
FAST
BECOMING
A
GAME
WITHOUT
THE
GOONS
I
ADMIT
KOCUR
MAY
GET
THE
FANS
INTO
THE
GAME
BUT
SURELY
THEY
WOULD
RATHER
SEE
BROTEN
TAKING
A
PASS
FROM
KOVALEV
AND
SCORING
A
BREAKAWAY
GOAL
TO
PUT
THE
RANGERS
UP
MAGIC
GOALS
IN
THE
THIRD
PERIOD
RATHER
THAN
SEEING
KOCUR
TAKE
ANOTHER
STUPID
PENALTY
AND
THE
RANGERS
GIVING
UP
ANOTHER
POWERPLAY
GOAL
THE
RANGERS
NEED
ANOTHER
TOP
FLIGHT
CENTER
WHO
CAN
TAKE
THE
PRESSURE
OFF
MESSIER
AND
THE
FIRST
LINE
NEMCHINOV
IS
A
PERFECT
THIRD
LINE
CENTER
SO
WHO
GOES
BEEZER
OR
RICHTER
KURT
