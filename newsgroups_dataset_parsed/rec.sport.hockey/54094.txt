IT
WAS
GREAT
TO
HEAR
THAT
UMASS
IS
BRINGING
BACK
HOCKEY
IT
REMINDED
ME
THAT
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AGO
THERE
WAS
TALK
THAT
BOTH
BIMIDGI
SP
AND
MANKATO
STATE
TRYING
TO
UPGRADE
THEIR
PROGRAMS
TO
DIV
STATUS
I
ALSO
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
THEY
HAD
SOME
TROUBLE
WITH
NEW
NCAA
RULE
ABOUT
JUST
WHO
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
COMPETE
AT
THE
DIV
LEVEL
WAS
THAT
EVER
RESOLVED
ALSO
I
WAS
JUST
WONDERING
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
COLLEGE
HOCKEY
EAST
OF
COLORADO
ALASKA
EXCEPTED
WITH
THE
NEW
POPULARITY
OF
HOCKEY
ON
THE
WEST
COAST
I
WOULD
EXPECT
THERE
TO
BE
SOME
INTEREST
BUILDING
AT
THE
COLLEGIATE
LEVELS
TOO
ANYONE
HEARD
ANYTHING
