ten
years
ago
the
number
of
europeans
in
the
nhl
was
roughly
a
quarter
of
what
it
is
now
going
into
the
season
the
numbers
of
euros
on
nhl
teams
have
escalated
to
the
following
stats
canadians
americans
europeans
please
note
that
these
numbers
are
rounded
off
and
taken
from
the
top
players
on
each
of
the
teams
my
source
is
the
vancouver
sun
heres
the
point
there
are
far
too
many
europeans
in
the
nhl
i
am
sick
of
watching
a
game
between
an
american
and
a
canadian
team
lets
say
the
red
wings
and
the
canucks
and
seeing
names
like
bure
konstantinov
and
borshevshky
is
this
north
america
or
isnt
it
toronto
detriot
quebec
and
edmonton
are
particularly
annoying
but
the
numbers
of
euros
on
other
teams
is
getting
worse
as
well
thats
why
we
have
expansion
to
create
more
jobs
nhl
teams
cant
afford
to
import
role
players
from
europe
they
pick
the
stars
but
will
continue
to
build
their
teams
around
local
players
with
the
numbers
of
euros
in
the
nhl
escalating
the
problem
is
clearly
only
getting
worse
im
all
for
the
creation
of
a
european
hockey
league
and
let
the
bures
and
selannes
of
the
world
play
on
their
own
continent
id
love
to
see
a
european
nhl
division
but
cant
see
it
happen
for
some
time
theres
simply
not
enough
fan
interest
at
the
moment
in
several
crucial
markets
like
germany
italy
and
france
while
sweden
and
finland
probably
cant
afford
to
shell
out
for
tickets
the
way
americancanadian
fans
do
call
it
the
minnesota
north
stars
effect
scandinavians
do
love
hockey
but
we
prefer
to
watch
local
inexpensive
hockey
to
the
nhl
the
national
hockey
league
should
love
the
idea
though
paneuropean
tv
channels
such
as
eurosport
could
bring
in
the
millions
the
american
networks
likely
never
will
pay
i
just
dont
want
them
on
mine
