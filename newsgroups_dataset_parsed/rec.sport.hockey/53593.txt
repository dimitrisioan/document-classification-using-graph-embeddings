CAREER
WITH

BOTH

I
LIKE
OUR

I
JUST
DONT
THINK
THE
NAMES
YOU
MENTION
COULD
CUT
IT
AS

IN
THE

EVEN
REXI
IN
HIS

WAS
MORE
OF

A

BECAUSE
HE

AN

WHICH
WAS
LETHARGIC
THAT

UNTIL

INTO

THE
OILERS
MISSED
HIM
MORE
THE

KURRI
AND
I
THINK
THE

WOULD
HAVE
MAKE
THE
FINALS
IF

HAS
STAYED
AROUND
THE

WOULD
