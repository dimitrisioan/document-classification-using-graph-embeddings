as
if
an
aluminum
stick
being
taken
to
ulfs
head
is
gonna
solve
the
problem
with
violence
in
the
sport
of
hockey
how
the
hell
can
you
say
the
guy
is
a
goon
and
justify
it
with
your
backassward
mentality
saying
that
hurting
a
player
will
solve
anyones
problems
is
asinine
new
rules
and
a
new
referee
system
need
to
be
instituted
right
now
too
many
of
the
real
goons
get
away
with
too
much
because
the
ref
is
watching
the
play
or
supposed
to
beive
seen
koharski
and
van
hellemond
to
name
a
few
with
their
heads
up
their
asses
on
a
few
calls
rather
than
keeping
an
eye
on
the
goofballs
behind
the
play
even
if
the
linesmen
were
able
to
call
all
penalties
it
would
be
an
improvement
unfortunately
that
is
the
way
the
league
is
heading
you
cant
fight
so
the
only
way
to
retaliate
against
someone
is
with
a
cheap
shot
when
the
ref
isnt
looking
ulf
has
brought
this
to
a
high
level
players
stuck
in
the
past
like
neely
who
prefer
fights
to
cheap
shots
are
at
a
disadvantage
in
the
new
system
lets
face
it
a
cheap
shot
like
high
sticking
is
a
very
effective
method
it
is
easier
to
hide
from
the
refs
has
a
better
chance
of
causing
injury
and
you
can
draw
people
into
fights
that
way
i
dont
like
it
but
thats
the
way
the
league
is
going
by
the
way
there
was
a
rather
good
hit
by
ulf
in
the
last
penguindevil
game
managed
to
hit
the
nj
player
in
the
face
with
a
stick
must
have
been
a
legal
hit
after
all
ulf
is
a
clean
player
and
is
allowed
to
do
things
like
that
