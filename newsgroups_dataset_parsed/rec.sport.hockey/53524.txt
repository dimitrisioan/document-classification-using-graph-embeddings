ISLES
HOCKEY
RAMBLINGS
WELL
THE
PATRICK
DIVISION
GOT
A
LITTLE
MORE
INTERESTING
LAST
NIGHT
THE
ISLANDERS
LOST
IN
OT
AND
THE
DEVILS
TIED
THE
PENS
THAT
MEANS
IF
THE
ISLES
BEAT
THE
DEVILS
ON
FRIDAY
THE
WILL
MEET
THE
CAPS
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
SOME
MORE
COMMENTS
ON
THE
ISLANDERS
AND
HOCKEY
IN
GENERAL
THAT
I
NEED
TO
GET
OFF
MY
CHEST
FIRST
OF
ALL
WITH
THE
ISLANDERS
BACKTOBACK
LACKLUSTER
PERFORMANCES
AGAINST
THE
WHALERS
ONE
MAY
THINK
THAT
THE
ISLANDERS
ARE
OUT
OF
SHAPE
THESE
GUYS
ALWAYS
SUCK
WIND
IN
THE
PERIOD
COME
ON
A
LITTLE
IN
THE
AND
RUN
OUT
OF
GAS
TOO
SOON
IT
IS
UNBELIEVEABLE
HOW
MANY
ONE
GOAL
GAMES
THESE
GUYS
HAVE
LOST
ANYWAY
THE
GAMES
WAS
PRETTY
WIDE
OPEN
THE
ISLES
STILL
HAVE
TONS
OF
TROUBLE
SCORING
THE
WHALERS
PLAYED
A
GOLIE
IN
IS
NHL
START
I
THINK
HIS
NAME
WAS
LENARDUZZI
SP
HIS
NHL
DEBUT
WAS
THE
TUESDAY
TIE
AGAINST
THE
ISLES
LIKE
I
MENTIONED
BEFORE
THIS
GUY
LOOKED
LIKE
THE
BEST
GOLIE
ON
THE
PLANET
FOR
A
WHILE
UNTIL
HE
MISPLAYED
A
MAHLAKOV
SLAP
SHOT
TO
GO
TO
OT
I
SAY
ITS
BECAUSE
THE
ISLES
DONT
SHOOT
CORRECTLY
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
NOTICED
THIS
ALSO
I
THINK
IT
IS
REALLY
A
SHAME
FOR
HOCKEY
WHEN
I
GUY
LIKE
MICK
VUKOTA
GETS
AS
MUCH
ICE
TIME
AS
HE
DOES
THIS
GUY
HAS
ABOUT
AS
MUCH
HOCKEY
TALENT
AS
JIGGS
MACDONALD
WHO
DID
PLAY
HOCKEY
I
THINK
ANYTIME
HE
GETS
THE
PUCK
IT
GETS
STOLEN
AND
HE
ALWAYS
STARTS
FIGHTS
AND
GETS
NEEDLESS
PENALTIES
RICHARD
PILON
IS
ANOTHER
GUY
WHO
IS
ON
THE
ICE
TO
STIR
UP
CRAP
AND
HES
A
DEFENSEMAN
HES
GOT
TO
BE
APPROACHING
NEGATIVE
INFINITY
FOR
HIS
PLUSMINUS
THIS
GUY
GETS
BEATEN
ALL
THE
TIME
WHY
THE
NEED
FOR
SUCH
ENFORCERS
NOT
ONLY
DO
FIGHTS
SLOW
THE
GAME
DOWN
ALOT
BUT
IT
TAKES
AWAY
FROM
THE
GUYS
WHO
ARE
REALLY
TRYING
TO
PLAY
THE
GAME
ILL
BE
ONE
OF
THE
FEW
TO
ADMIT
I
DO
ENJOY
A
GOOD
FIGHT
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
BUT
ONLY
WHEN
ITS
CALLED
FOR
YOU
KNOW
WHEN
A
GUY
CHECKS
THE
GOALIE
TOO
HARD
IN
OTHER
WORDS
A
VIOLATION
OF
HOCKEY
ETHICS
MIGHT
CAUSE
YOU
TO
GET
PUCHED
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
START
CRAP
WHEN
YOU
ARE
LOSING
OR
BECUASE
YOU
CAN
GET
AWAY
WITH
IT
DOES
ANYONE
AGREE
THAT
REFEREES
NEED
TO
BE
A
LITTLE
LESS
LENIENT
IN
THE
AND
OT
I
MEAN
COME
ON
ALREADY
IM
SICK
OF
SEEING
TEAMS
PULLING
GUYS
DOWN
HOLDING
GUYS
ETC
JUST
BECUASE
THE
REFEREE
DOESNT
CALL
IT
OT
AND
LATE
IN
THE
SHOULD
BE
A
TIME
FOR
STRATEGY
NOT
PHYSICAL
PROWESS
TRYING
TO
SET
UP
A
GOAL
SHOULD
BE
FIRST
AND
FOREMOST
IF
YOU
ARE
SO
AFRAID
THAT
THE
OTHER
TEAM
IS
GOING
TO
SCORE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
PULL
A
GUY
DOWN
TO
PREVENT
IT
YOU
DONT
DESERVE
TO
WIN
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
