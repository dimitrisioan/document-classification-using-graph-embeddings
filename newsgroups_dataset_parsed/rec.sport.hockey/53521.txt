barasso
the
cheap
shot
master
after
watching
the
pengiuns
all
year
and
as
many
other
teams
as
possible
ive
really
noticed
an
increase
in
tom
barassos
cheap
shots
this
year
and
not
noticed
a
corrsponding
increase
with
other
goaltenders
ive
also
noticed
that
he
usually
gets
away
with
it
just
as
examples
last
night
i
noticed
him
elbowing
scott
stevens
in
the
head
which
basically
started
the
whole
shoving
match
that
got
stevens
scott
and
tocchet
minute
minors
he
also
kicked
john
mclean
of
course
he
wasnt
called
for
that
isnt
kicking
an
automatic
match
penalty
and
game
suspension
i
think
glenn
anderson
got
one
a
few
years
ago
for
kicking
gaetan
duchesne
in
the
chest
theres
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
barasso
is
the
dirtiest
golatender
since
hextall
hes
also
very
good
how
about
that
tocchet
headbutt
is
there
an
automatic
susppension
that
goes
along
with
a
nonkicking
match
penalty
i
cant
remember
anymore
oh
the
playoffs
should
be
fun
