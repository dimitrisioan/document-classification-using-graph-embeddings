i
am
an
ulf
and
pgh
fan
and
what
pisses
me
off
about
the
whole
adam
graves
ulf
samuesson
debate
is
that
ulf
plays
hardhitting
hockey
nothing
wrong
with
that
while
graves
does
what
he
does
when
the
only
way
to
win
a
game
is
to
intentionally
hurt
someone
which
bites
jeesus
i
never
thought
id
see
the
day
when
i
defended
a
ranger
you
obviously
dont
watch
much
hockey
if
you
think
that
graves
is
a
goon
he
is
one
of
the
hardest
working
rangers
check
that
the
hardest
working
ranger
he
had
goals
this
year
not
bad
for
a
checking
type
of
player
and
showed
up
for
every
single
game
this
season
unlike
that
stiff
messier
he
is
fearless
and
throws
clean
checks
he
will
also
stand
up
to
someone
after
he
hits
them
not
like
that
pussy
oaf
exactly
my
point
if
youd
watch
games
more
closely
youd
see
a
lot
of
goons
going
after
him
ulf
is
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
less
physical
players
for
pgh
are
left
alone
ulf
plays
rough
hockey
but
only
when
other
players
are
putting
the
rush
on
mario
or
jagr
if
you
want
to
say
anyone
on
the
penguins
is
a
cheap
shot
or
a
goon
say
its
jennings
or
caufield
dontslander
a
good
defenseman
because
your
favorite
players
cant
beat
the
pens
even
when
they
take
dives
like
gartner
to
try
for
the
cheap
penalties
as
for
his
slash
of
lemieux
fine
it
was
a
cheap
shot
it
is
the
exception
not
the
rule
i
bet
you
think
mike
gartner
is
a
goon
because
of
the
time
that
he
slashed
the
hell
out
of
oafs
arm
last
year
right
after
all
he
did
get
a
suspension
for
it
hey
thats
fine
if
a
player
does
something
stupid
he
should
be
penalized
including
ulf
or
mario
youre
not
likely
to
see
that
happen
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
its
pointless
to
say
any
one
person
is
a
cheapshot
goon
because
youll
see
everyone
take
a
cheap
shot
now
and
then
especially
if
youresomeone
who
is
shadowed
as
much
as
ulf
is
