re
european
expansion
and
our
fcked
system
how
long
would
they
support
teams
that
are
run
on
rangerbased
corporate
thinking
i
use
the
term
lightly
we
dont
need
a
good
product
because
these
duffuses
in
nyc
would
fill
the
arena
for
ottawas
record
every
haha
sorry
had
ta
say
it
look
how
long
the
maple
leafs
and
nordiques
used
similar
logic
not
that
they
fielded
bad
teams
solely
to
field
bad
teams
but
the
maple
leafs
and
a
certain
dead
man
who
was
in
charge
were
one
of
the
cheapest
teams
in
the
history
of
the
sport
guess
what
they
were
immensely
popular
at
the
gate
the
nordiques
have
also
done
well
for
a
team
that
had
missed
the
playoffs
so
many
years
in
a
row
look
at
british
or
any
european
soccer
as
an
example
they
never
have
fan
problems
ha
such
humor
they
have
major
fan
problems
namely
that
on
occasion
some
of
them
dont
make
it
home
from
the
match
the
soccer
fans
tend
to
be
fanatical
much
like
the
montreal
fans
who
firebomb
the
players
and
coaches
houses
when
they
play
pathetically
