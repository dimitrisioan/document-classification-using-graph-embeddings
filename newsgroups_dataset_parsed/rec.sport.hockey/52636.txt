DIVISION
BY
ZERO
ERROR
IN
JACK
NICKALUS
TOURNAMENT
GOLF
I
WAS
PLAYING
THIS
GOLF
GAME
AND
SOMETHING
INTERESTING
HAPPENED
ON
THE
HOLE
I
DROVE
THE
BALL
DOWN
THE
FAIRWAY
WHEN
THE
BALL
WAS
IN
MIDFLIGHT
THE
GAME
COMPLETELY
FROZE
A
COUPLE
SECONDS
LATER
THE
SCREEN
WENT
COMPLETELY
BLACK
WITH
AN
ERROR
MESSAGE
IN
LARGE
BUBBLE
LETTERS
THAT
SAID
DIVISION
BY
ZERO
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
FUNNY
CONSIDERING
I
AM
A
COMPUTER
PROGRAMMER
AND
I
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
AN
ERROR
LIKE
THIS
ON
AN
ACTUAL
VIDEO
GAME
SYSTEM
LIKE
SEGA
OR
NINTENDO
OR
EVEN
ATARI
OR
INTELLEVISION
YEARS
AGO
OH
YEAH
AFTER
THE
MESSAGE
THERE
WAS
ALSO
WHAT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
AN
ADDRESS
IN
HEXADECIMAL
I
FORGET
THE
EXACT
HEX
CODE
THAT
WAS
GIVEN
HAS
THIS
HAPPENED
TO
ANYONE
ELSE
IT
MUST
HAVE
MY
GAME
SHOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
THE
ONLY
ONE
TO
DO
THIS
