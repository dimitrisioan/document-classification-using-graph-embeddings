HE
WASNT
IN

HE
WASNT
IN
KANSAS

AND
HIS
NAME
HASNT
APPEARED
ON
THE
WAIVER
WIRE
AND
THAT
KIND
OF
INVISIBILITY
WAS
PREVALENT
FOR
THE

LIGHTNING
DEPALMA
HAD
AN
EXCELLENT
WEEK
SCORING
POINTS
IN

WHILE

UNFORTUNATELY
THE
DEPALMA
THEN
DISAPPEARED
THE
REST
OF
THE
WAY
GETTING
JUST
MORE
POINTS
IN
MORE
GAMES
AND
GENERALLY
LOOKED
LETHARGIC
AND
UNINTERESTED
ON
BOTH
ENDS
OF
THE

HE
THEN
WAS
SENT
DOWN
TO
KANSAS
CITY
WALKED
OUT
FROM
THERE

WAS
SUSPENDED

LATER
REINSTATED
WHEN
IT
WAS
REVEALED

THEN
PROMPTLY
DISAPPEARED

TREMENDOUSLY
THROUGHOUT
THE

AND
WAS
ACTUALLY
QUITE
A

HE
LED
THE

IN

BRUCE
WAS
BOTHERED
VIRTUALLY
ALL
OF
THIS
SEASON
WITH
A
GROIN
INJURY
WHICH
KEPT
HIM
OUT
OF
THE
LINEUP
FOR
ALL
BY
GAMES
THIS
SEASON
OF
COURSE
IT
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
SPECULATE
HOW
WELL
HE
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
THIS
SEASON
HAD
HE
NOT
BEEN
AFFECTED
BY
THE
INJURY
BUT
THE
BRUCE
WAS
EFFECTIVE
WITH
A
MAN
UP
OR
A
MAN
SHORT
IN
THE
SHARKS
FIRST
SEASON
AND
WAS
EXPECTED
TO
BE
A
STRONG
OFFENSIVE
LEADER
THIS
SEASON
AS
WELL
THE
INJURY
APPEARS
SERIOUS
WHICH
IS
A
SHAME
BECAUSE
OTHERWISE
HE
MAY
HAVE
A
MUCH
BRIGHTER

IT
IS
DIFFICULT

TO
UNDERSTAND
THE
FLYERS
DECISION
TO
UNLOAD
PEDERSON
AFTER
A
VERY
GOOD
OFFENSIVE
SEASON
LAST
SEASON
POINTS
IN
GAMES
BUT
AFTER
RIDING
THE
PINE
EARLY
IN
THE
SEASON
PEDERSON
WAS
SUMMARILY
SENT
TO
THE
SHARKS
IN
EXCHANGE
OF
THE
DEFENSIVEMINDED
SNUGGERUD
AND
HE
FINISHED
WITH
GAMES
COMBINED
WITH
THE
FLYERS
AND
THE
SHARKS
HE
WAS
ALSO
LIMITED
BY
INJURIES
THIS
SEASON
AND
THIS
LIMITED
HIS
PRODUCTION

BUT
WHEN
HEALTHY
PEDERSON
APPEARS
IMPRESSIVE
WITH
A
GOOD

TOUCH
GOOD
SIZE
AND
THE
WILLINGNESS
TO
THROW
IT
AROUND
ALTHOUGH
HES
NOT
CONSIDERED
A
PHYSICAL
FORWARD
AND
GOOD
SPEED
HE
ALSO
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
LIABILITY
ON
DEFENSE
BUT
THE
SHARKS
PROBABLY
HAVE
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
NEXT

SEE
HOW
MUCH

CAN
DO

DEFINITELY
ONE

THE
HARD
WORK
WORKED
WONDERS
AS
AT
TIMES
HE
LOOKED
GREAT
ON

HOWEVER
ALTHOUGH
HE
DID
LOOK
GREAT
AT
TIMES
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
RECEIVED
JUST
POINTS
IN
GAMES
FOR
HIS
EFFORTS
IS
A
SIGN
THAT
THERE
IS
ONLY
SO
MUCH
HIS
HARD
WORK
CAN
DO
AND
THE
SHARKS
CONFIRMED
THAT
BY
SENDING
HIM
TO
KANSAS
CITY
WITH
ABOUT

LEFT
IN
THE
SEASON
CARTER
WHO
WILL
TURN
ON
MAY
ALWAYS
HUSSLED
BUT
AS
A
RESULT
WAS
SOMETIMES
TRAPPED
TOO
DEEP
WITHIN
THE
OFFENSIVE
ZONE
WHILE
FORECHECKING
BUT
HE
WAS
GENERALLY
A
CREDIT
ON
THE
DEFENSIVE
END
BUT
HE
IS
PROBABLY
OF
LIMITED
UTILITY
IN
THAT
CAPACITY
AND
HE
DID
NOT
IMPRESS
OFFENSIVELY
ALTHOUGH
