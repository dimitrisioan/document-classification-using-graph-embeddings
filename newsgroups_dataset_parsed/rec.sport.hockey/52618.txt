realignment
in
well
here
it
is
nhl
in
the
year
i
got
these
from
a
very
reliable
source
in
a
dream
some
years
ago
and
although
i
initially
thought
i
had
just
been
taking
too
many
too
strong
drugs
now
it
seems
the
realization
has
really
begun
you
can
see
the
league
has
already
started
to
move
to
this
direction
the
walt
disney
conference
anaheim
mighty
chipmunks
franchise
name
to
be
changed
after
each
new
la
kings
hockey
movie
la
flames
weve
seen
some
of
that
san
jose
sharks
san
diego
bruins
tijuana
red
wings
detroits
hockey
team
will
follow
its
car
industry
dallas
stars
houston

texas

youve
heard
them
starting
getting

montreal
quebecois
sp
there
will
be
no
canada
atlanta

the

will
never

huh
palm
beach
capitals
now
that
the
anahaim
team
is
becomming
real
im
really
beginning
to
believe
the
rest
of
the
message
im
sure
the
future
will
turn
you
into
believers
too
after
the
nhl
will
abandond
icerinks
its
so
expensive
to
cool
down
the
rinks
in
the
subtropics
and
the
locals
hardly
know
what
ice
is
anyway
nhl
will
become
a
roller
skating
hockey
league
that
way
it
can
create
more
public
interest
in
the
game
when
local
supporteres
can
play
the
game
in
their
back
yards
i
hope
im
just
out
of
my
mind
there
wont
really
be
a
disney
team
in
anaheim
will
there
the
stars
arent
really
moving
