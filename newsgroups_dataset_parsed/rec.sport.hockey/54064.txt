RE
RANGER
FANS
IN
ARTICLE
KWOLFEREAGLEWESLEYANEDU
WRITES
I
FOR
ONE
AM
HAPPY
ABOUT
THE
RANGERS
HIRING
OF
KEENAN
ITS
TOO
BAD
THAT
THEY
I
AGREE
THAT
KEENAN
IS
AN
EXCELLENT
CHOICE
DID
YOU
SEE
MIKE
LUPICAS
COLUMN
IN
SUNDAYS
NEWS
MY
SENTIMENTS
EXACTLY
I
THINK
HE
JUST
MAY
BE
THE
ONE
TO
INSTILL
SOME
HUNGER
AND
FIRE
INTO
THEIR
HEARTS
NEXT
SEASON
EITHER
THAT
OR
HES
GOING
TO
BE
KICKING
ALOT
OF
BUTT
READING
THROUGH
MOST
OF
THESE
HOCKEY
NEWS
I
DONT
SEE
MANY
RANGER
FANS
WRITING
IM
HERE
BUT
AM
NEW
TO
THIS
GROUP
AND
HAVE
BEEN
KEEPING
FAIRLY
QUIET
YOU
KNOW
DOING
THE
LURKING
THING
I
DONT
HAVE
A
SENSE
HOW
MANY
RANGERS
FANS
THERE
ARE
ON
THE
LIST
EITHER
I
AM
A
DIEHARD
RANGER
FAN
I
GUESS
I
HAVE
TO
BE
I
SAT
IN
THE
GARDEN
THROUGHOUT
THE
PENGUINS
LED
BY
MARIOS
GOALS
DECIMATION
OF
THEM
ON
BUT
AM
SICK
AT
THE
ABUNDANCE
OF
TALENT
THAT
HAS
BEEN
TOTALLY
UNTAPPED
AND
THE
LACK
OF
HEART
DISPLAYED
THIS
SEASON
I
HAVE
SOME
FINAL
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
WAY
THE
TEAM
WAS
HANDLED
IN
THAT
LAST
DREADFUL
STRETCH
KNOWING
THEY
NEEDED
OFFENSIVE
HELP
FROM
THE
BLUELINE
WHY
DIDNT
WE
SEE
MIKE
HURLBUT
WHO
PLAYED
PRETTY
WELL
WHEN
HE
WAS
CALLED
UP
WHEN
LEETCH
FIRST
WENT
DOWN
HURLBUT
WAS
INJURED
FOR
QUITE
A
WHILE
IM
NOT
SURE
BUT
I
THINK
HE
MAY
HAVE
RECOVERED
IN
TIME
FOR
THE
PLAYOFF
RUN
AND
IF
SO
LIKE
YOU
QUESTION
WHY
HE
WASNT
USED
WHY
IS
JOE
KOCUR
PLAYING
EVERY
NIGHT
HE
IS
NOT
BOB
PROBERT
WHO
IS
TOUGH
BUT
ALSO
CAN
PLAY
I
BELIEVE
KOCUR
WAS
USED
IN
MANY
INSTANCES
FOR
HIS
INTIMIDATION
FACTOR
GRANTED
HE
SEEMED
TO
GET
AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF
ICE
TIME
FOR
THAT
REASON
ALONE
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
REALIZE
THAT
WHEN
A
TEAM
IS
NOT
DOING
ANY
REAL
PHYSICAL
INTIMIDATION
ID
LIKE
TO
HAVE
A
NICKEL
FOR
EVERY
TIME
JD
SAID
THEYVE
GOT
TO
TAKE
THE
BODY
MORE
YOUVE
GOT
TO
AT
LEAST
HAVE
SOME
ILLUSIONS
HOW
COME
PAUL
BROTEN
IS
RELEGATED
TO
STREET
CLOTHES
FOR
THE
END
OF
THE
SEASON
AT
LEAST
HE
PLAYS
WITH
SOME
HEART
AND
CHARACTER
DRAWS
PENALTIES
AND
PLAYS
WHEN
HES
ON
THE
ICE
WAS
HE
IN
THE
DOGHOUSE
FOR
SOME
REASON
I
AGREE
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
JOE
CIRELLA
ENOUGH
SAID
SORRY
I
DONT
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
I
THINK
JOEY
C
DID
A
GOOD
JOB
FILLING
IN
WHEN
HE
WAS
ASKED
TO
I
CANT
IMAGINE
THAT
ITS
EASY
GOING
FROM
NEAR
ICE
TIME
TO
BEING
A
FULL
TIMER
I
DONT
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
HIM
TURNING
THE
PUCK
OVER
AT
THE
BLUE
LINE
TOO
MUCH
OR
FAILING
TO
CLEAR
THE
ZONE
HE
WORKED
HARD
AND
AT
LEAST
DIDNT
MAKE
ANY
ROOKIE
MISTAKES
AS
HE
SAID
HIMSELF
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
HE
CAN
ONLY
GIVE
WHAT
HE
HAS
AND
HE
DID
RANGER
FANS
MAY
BE
SUFFERING
BUT
WERE
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
LOYAL
UNLIKE
ISLANDER
FANS
WHO
ONLY
SHOW
UP
WHEN
THE
TEAM
WINS
ABSOLUTELY
I
THINK
ATTENDANCE
AT
THE
GARDEN
WAS
BETTER
ON
THE
LAST
DAY
OF
THE
SEASON
THAN
ANY
AVERAGE
NIGHT
FOR
THE
ISLANDERS
FOUGHT
SERIES
MARIO
IS
AMAZING
THE
MAN
IS
AWESOME
IN
A
WAY
IM
ENJOYING
THE
PLAYOFFS
MORE
NOW
THAT
THE
RANGERS
ARENT
IN
THEM
I
CAN
REALLY
APPRECIATE
ALL
THE
GLORY
MARIO
IS
GETTING
WITHOUT
HATING
HIM
BECAUSE
HES
ON
THE
OPPOSING
TEAM
HE
DESERVES
IT
ALL
AS
FAR
AS
IM
CONCERNED
