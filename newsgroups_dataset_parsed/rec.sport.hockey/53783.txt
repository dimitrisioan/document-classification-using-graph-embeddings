RON
FRANCIS
IN
ARTICLE
MATTHEW
J
RUSH
WRITES
I
FORGOT
TO
ASK
IS
THIS
THE
HIGHEST
POINTS
TOTAL
FRANCIS
HAS
HAD
IN
A
SEASON
HAS
HE
EVER
HAD
A
POINT
SEASON
BEFORE
EITHER
WITH
THE
PENS
OR
THE
WHALERS
FRANCIS
GOT
IN
HIS
LAST
FULL
SEASON
WITH
HARTFORD
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
YOUR
PREVIOUS
POST
I
THINK
FRANCIS
IS
A
TREMENDOUS
AND
GENERALLY
UNDERRATED
COMPLETE
PLAYER
I
WOULD
LOVE
TO
HAVE
HIM
HERE
IN
A
CAPITALS
UNIFORM
WHERE
HE
WOULD
CERTAINLY
BE
THE
CENTER
EVEN
THOUGH
PIVONKA
IS
ALSO
A
VERY
GOOD
COMPLETE
PLAYER
WHO
IS
GENERALLY
UNDERRATED
FRANCIS
IMPRESSES
ME
IN
MANY
WAYS
AS
AN
ETHICAL
DALE
HUNTER
TONS
OF
HEART
AND
CANDO
ATTITUDE
WITH
A
LOT
OF
DIFFERENT
SKILLS
BUT
NONE
OF
THE
CHEAP
SHOTS
AND
FEW
PENALTY
MINUTES
NOT
TO
MENTION
NEARLY
ALWAYS
COMING
THROUGH
WHEN
ITS
IMPORTANT
