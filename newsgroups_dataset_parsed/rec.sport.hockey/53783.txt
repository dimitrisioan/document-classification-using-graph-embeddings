i
forgot
to
ask
is
this
the
highest
points
total
francis
has
had
in
a
season
has
he
ever
had
a
point
season
before
either
with
the
pens
or
the
whalers
francis
got
in
his
last
full
season
with
hartford
in
agreement
with
your
previous
post
i
think
francis
is
a
tremendous
and
generally
underrated
complete
player
i
would
love
to
have
him
here
in
a
capitals
uniform
where
he
would
certainly
be
the
center
even
though
pivonka
is
also
a
very
good
complete
player
who
is
generally
underrated
francis
impresses
me
in
many
ways
as
an
ethical
dale
hunter
tons
of
heart
and
cando
attitude
with
a
lot
of
different
skills
but
none
of
the
cheap
shots
and
few
penalty
minutes
not
to
mention
nearly
always
coming
through
when
its
important
