WRITES
STUFF
DELETED
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
PREDICTING
AN
UPSET
AGAINST
PITTSBURGH
THE
TEAM
HAS
WON
IN
A
ROW
COMING
INTO
THE
PLAYOFFS
THEYVE
WON
PRACTICALLY
EVERY
GAME
THAT
THEYVE
REALLY
WANTED
TO
WIN
ALL
YEAR
INCLUDING
CRITICAL
VICTORIES
AGAINST
THE
CAPS
AND
ONE
AGAINST
A
HOT
BRUINS
TEAM
AT
THE
GAAHDEN
THE
TEAM
IS
PROBABLY
AT
ITS
PEAK
STRONGER
THAN
THE
PREVIOUS
STANLEY
CUP
WINNERS
I
MEAN
I
KNOW
THEY
CAN
LOSE
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
LARGE
UPSET
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
TEAMS
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
HARD
PRESSED
TO
WIN
OR
GAMES
IN
ANY
SERIES
AGAINST
THE
PENS
AND
IM
NOT
A
PITTSBURGH
FAN
I
HAVE
TO
AGREE
HERE
AS
I
HEARD
ON
TSN
TONIGHT
YOU
WANT
TO
PICK
SOMEONE
ELSE
BUT
YOU
JUST
DONT
SEE
HOW
YOU
CAN
AND
IM
A
BRUINS
FAN
MAYBE
THIS
YEAR
WILL
BE
DIFFERENT
BUT
IT
DOESNT
LOOK
GOOD
TIME
WILL
TELL
THOUGH
LOTS
