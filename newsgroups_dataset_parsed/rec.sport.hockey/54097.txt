I
DONT
THINK
TRADING
KISIO
WAS
INTRINSICALLY
A
MISTAKE
HOWEVER
TRADING
HIM
FOR
A
ROUND
PICK
WOULD
BE
HE
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
WORTH
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
A
ROUND
PICK
FOR
A
PLAYOFF
TEAM
IN
FACT
I
WOULD
INTIMATE
THAT
THE
OFFERS
THE
SHARKS
GOT
THIS
YEAR
FOR
KISIO
WERE
WAY
GREATER
THAN
JUST
A
ROUND
PICK
HINDSIGHTS
NOBODY
EXPECTED
KISIO
TO
HAVE
HIS
BEST
CAREER
YEAR
BESIDES
WITHOUT
KISIO
THE
SHARKS
WOULD
HAVE
TANKED
EVEN
EARLIER
IN
THE
SEASON
AND
GUND
MIGHT
HAVE
GOTTEN
A
LITTLE
MORE
SERIOUS
ABOUT
GETTING
JOE
MURPHY
A
GUY
WHO
DEFINITELY
WOULD
BE
AROUND
YEARS
FROM
NOW
WHEN
THE
SHARKS
DO
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
WHAT
ELSE
COULD
BE
DONE
THE
GUNDS
OFFERED
MILLION
FOR
MURPHY
BUT
THE
OILERS
WANTED
PROSPECTS
WHICH
THE
SHARKS
DECLINED
TO
GIVE
WHICH
I
THINK
IS
CORRECT
I
DIDNT
MEAN
TO
IMPLY
THAT
GUNDS
OFFER
WASNT
ENOUGH
GUNDS
OFFER
WAS
THE
RIGHT
BUT
TOO
LATE
IN
THE
SEASON
OFFERED
IN
NOVEMBER
LETS
SATHER
BUY
A
REPLACEMENT
FOR
MURPHY
THIS
SEASON
AND
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
THIS
YEAR
IN
MARCH
DOESNT
HELP
SATHER
WITH
HIS
IMMEDIATE
OBJECTIVES
DOESNT
HELP
WITH
LONG
TERM
OBJECTIVES
ONLY
A
PROSPECT
OR
DRAFT
PICK
DOES
AND
NO
WAY
SHOULD
THE
SHARKS
DO
THAT
HOWEVER
GETTING
BACK
TO
WHATIF
GAMES
HAD
KISIO
BEEN
TRADED
TO
CHICAGO
LAST
YEAR
THEN
THE
SHARKS
GO
FOR
OCTOBER
AND
MAYBE
GUND
PANICKS
SOONER
IN
NOVEMBER
AND
HERES
ANOTHER
WHATIF
TWIST
CHICAGO
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
KISIO
THIS
SEASON
THEY
NEVER
GO
AFTER
MURPHY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
BECAUSE
KELLY
IS
HAVING
HIS
BEST
SEASON
BIGGER
GUYS
IN
CHICAGO
SO
GUND
HAS
NO
COMPETITION
SO
FERRIERA
SATHER
AND
KEENAN
ALL
LOOK
LIKE
GENIUSES
A
BROKEN
FAX
MACHINE
AND
FERRIERA
KEENAN
AND
MAYBE
KINGSTON
AND
MAYBE
EVEN
GREEN
LOSE
THEIR
JOBS
KIND
OF
MAKES
YOU
SHIVER
DOESNT
IT
BOTTOMLINE
FOR
EVERY
BLACK
SCENARIO
ANY
OF
YOU
CAN
CONCOCT
FOR
KISIO
LEAVING
I
CAN
CONCOCT
AN
EQUALLY
BRIGHT
ONE
IF
THE
KISIOFIASCO
WAS
THE
CAUSE
OF
FERIERRAS
DOWN
FALL
I
HOPE
IT
WASNT
BECAUSE
HE
TRIED
TO
TRADE
KISIO
BUT
BECAUSE
HE
SCREWED
IT
UP
NONETHELESS
IM
SORRY
FERIERRA
AND
KINGSTON
ARE
GONE
AND
I
WISH
GUND
WOULD
FOLLOW
AND
WHAT
HAVE
THE
GUNDS
DONE
EXACTLY
THAT
CAUSED
YOU
TO
WISH
THAT
THEY
WERE
GONE
ARE
YOU
SERIOUS
LET
FERIERRA
GO
FIRE
KINGSTON
THESE
LAST
TWO
BASICALLY
MEAN
THAT
SHARKS
ARE
STARTING
OVER
AGAIN
IN
TERMS
OF
THE
TIMETABLE

CAPTURE
THE
CUP
AS
IVE
STATED
FREQUENTLY

RETURNED
WIRTZ

THEM
MIKE
EISLER
MREENGSUNCOM
NOT
ONLY
ARE
THEY
LEAFS
THE
BEST
TEAM
BUT
THEIR
FANS
ARE
EVEN
MORE
INTELLIGENT
AND
INSIGHTFUL
THAN
PITTSBURGHS
THEIR
PLAYERS

MIGHTY
BRIGHT
