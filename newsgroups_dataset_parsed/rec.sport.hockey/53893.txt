DID
YOU
REALLY
EXPECT
TORONTO
TO
GO
ANYWHERE
REALLY
DETROIT
IS
A
VERY
DISCIPLINED
TEAM
THERES
A
LOT
OF
EUROPEANS
IN
DETROIT
WHICH
WOULD
MAKE
THE
GAME
FAST
SO
TORONTO
WOULD
HAVE
TO
SLOW
THE
GAME
DOWN
WHICH
MEANS
DRAWING
PENALTIES
AS
A
LAST
RESORT
ANYWAY
TORONTO
WILL
BE
A
GOOD
TEAM
AS
SOON
AS
THEY
GET
MORE
GOOD
PLAYERS
TORONTO
IS
JUST
AN
AVERAGE
TEAM
DETROIT
ISNT
BALLARD
SCREWED
TORONTO
WHEN
HE
WAS
OWNER
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
AND
ITS
GOING
TO
TAKE
TIME
FOR
TORONTO
TO
BECOME
A
REAL
FORCE
I
EXPECT
GILMOUR
TO
BE
BURNT
OUT
NEXT
YEAR
HE
CANT
PULL
THE
WHOLE
TEAM
FOREVER
