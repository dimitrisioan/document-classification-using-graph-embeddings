RANDY
A
GRACA
WRITES
I
ALSO
THINK
THAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
WITH
PITTSBURGH
IF
THEY
FACE
THEM
IN
THE
FINALS
WHICH
IS
WHAT
ALL
THE
DETROIT
SPORTSWRITERS
ARE
PREDICTING
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
BRYAN
MURRAY
IS
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
GM
I
HAVE
EVER
SEEN
IN
HOCKEY
HOW
DO
YOU
FIGURE
THAT
WHEN
BRYAN
MURRAY
TOOK
OVER
THE
WINGS
THEY
WERE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
TEAM
THAT
WAS
CONTENDING
FOR
THE
STANLEY
CUP
BUT
LOOKED
UNLIKELY
TO
WIN
IT
NOW
THEY
ARE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
TEAM
THAT
IS
CONTENDING
FOR
THE
STANLEY
CUP
BUT
LOOKS
UNLIKELY
TO
WIN
IT
A
TRULY
GREAT
GM
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
MAKE
THE
MOVES
TO
PUSH
THE
TEAM
TO
THE
UPPER
ECHELON
OF
THE
NHL
AND
MAYBE
WIN
THE
STANLEY
CUP
A
GOOD
GM
LIKE
MURRAY
CAN
MAINTAIN
THE
TEAMS
SUCCESS
BUT
CANT
PUSH
THEM
TO
THE
NEXT
LEVEL
WHEN
JACQUES
DEMERS
BROUGHT
THE
WINGS
TO
THE
CONFERENCE
FINALS
TWICE
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
HE
HAD
EVERYONE
ON
THE
TEAM
GIVING
PERCENT
BUT
HE
HAD
VERY
LITTLE
TALENT
HE
HAD
YZERMAN
BOB
PROBERT
WHO
HAD
DRINKING
PROBLEMS
AT
THE
TIME
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
DECENT
GOALTENDERS
IN
HANLON
AND
STEFAN
WHO
GOT
HOT
THATS
ABOUT
IT
CAN
YOU
NAME
ONE
PLAYER
ON
THOSE
EARLIER
TEAMS
WHO
EVEN
DESERVED
TO
BE
IN
THE
ALLSTAR
GAME
MUCH
LESS
ACTUALLY
GOT
THERE
OTHER
THAN
YZERMAN
AND
PROBERT
LIKE
PETR
KLIMA
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
WHEN
THEY
FACED
EDMONTON
IN
BOTH
OF
THOSE
CONFERENCE
FINALS
AS
HARD
AS
THEY
PLAYED
IT
WAS
CLEAR
THEY
FACED
A
TEAM
THAT
SIMPLY
HAD
SUPERIOR
TALENT
TO
THE
WINGS
THATS
WHY
THEY
COULD
NOT
GET
TO
THE
FINALS
ALSO
AT
THAT
TIME
THE
NORRIS
DIVISION
WAS
STILL
THE
WEAKEST
DIVISION
IN
HOCKEY
AND
GETTING
PAST
CHICAGO
AND
TORONTO
WAS
NOT
AS
IMPRESSIVE
AS
IT
IS
TODAY
MURRAY
HAS
BROUGHT
SCORING
TALENT
TO
THE
WINGS
THAT
THEY
DID
NOT
HAVE
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
DEVELLANO
WAS
GM
AND
DEMERS
WAS
COACH
TO
NAME
A
FEW
YSEBAERT
KOZLOV
AND
PAUL
COFFEY
WHO
HAS
MADE
A
DEFINITE
POSITIVE
IMPACT
ON
THE
POWER
PLAY
ESPECIALLY
MURRAY
HAS
BUILT
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
TALENTED
TEAMS
IN
HOCKEY
AT
THE
PRESENT
WITH
THE
POSSIBLE
EXCEPTION
OF
THE
PITTSBURGH
PENGUINS
THE
WINGS
HAVE
AT
LEAST
FIVE
GOAL
SCORERS
THAT
I
CAN
THINK
OF
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
DEFENSEMAN
WITH
OVER
GAMES
WORTH
OF
PLAYOFF
EXPERIENCE
MURRAYS
ONE
FAILING
IS
THAT
UNLIKE
THE
OTHER
GMS
YOU
MENTIONED
WHO
ARE
DEFINITELY
ALSO
GOOD
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
HE
HAS
NOT
FOUND
FOR
HIMSELF
A
STRONG
COACH
TO
MOTIVATE
THE
TEAM
TO
GO
OUT
AND
GIVE
PERCENT
FOR
THE
FULL
MINUTES
EVERY
NIGHT
LIKE
THEY
DID
THE
LAST
TIME
THEY
MADE
A
CUP
RUN
WHEN
A
TEAM
WINS
OR
LOSES
ITS
A
REFLECTION
OF
THE
GM
AND
THE
COACH
WHICH
WAS
THE
POINT
OF
MY
ORIGINAL
POST
IF
THE
TEAM
OUTMATCHES
THEIR
OPPONENT
IN
TERMS
OF
TALENT
BUT
LOSES
ANYWAY
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
THE
CASE
THIS
YEAR
WHEN
THE
WINGS
HAVE
STRUGGLED
THAT
INDICATES
THAT
THE
GM
HAS
DONE
HIS
JOB
IN
BUILDING
UP
THE
TEAM
BUT
THE
COACH
HAS
FAILED
TO
MOTIVATE
THEM
IF
AS
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
LAST
RUN
THE
WINGS
MADE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
BEFORE
MURRAY
CAME
THEY
GAVE
OPPONENTS
A
HARD
TIME
WHO
SHOULD
HAVE
BEATEN
THEM
EASILY
THAT
INDICATES
GOOD
COACHING
MAKING
UP
FOR
A
LACK
OF
TALENT
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
FINE
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
MURRAY
WAS
A
BAD
GM
I
MERELY
SAID
THAT
HE
ISNT
THE
BEST
GM
IN
HOCKEY
OR
EVEN
A
CONTENDER
FOR
THAT
HONOR
IF
MURRAY
IS
AS
GREAT
AS
YOU
CLAIM
THE
WINGS
WOULD
HAVE
WON
THE
STANLEY
CUP
BY
NOW
PROBABLY
MORE
THAN
ONCE
IF
HE
WAS
AS
GREAT
A
GM
AS
YOU
CLAIM
AND
HE
WAS
AS
POOR
A
COACH
AS
YOU
CLAIM
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
INTELLIGENT
ENOUGH
TO
HIRE
THE
COACH
TO
PUSH
THE
TEAM
TO
THE
NEXT
LEVEL
OF
SUCCESS
BUT
MURRAY
IS
AN
AVERAGE
UNSPECTACULAR
NHL
COACH
AND
A
PRETTY
GOOD
GM
SO
NONE
OF
THIS
IS
TRUE
ANYWAY
