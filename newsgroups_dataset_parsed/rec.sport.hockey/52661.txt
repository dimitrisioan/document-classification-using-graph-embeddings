RE
TOO
MANY
EUROPEANS
IN
NHL
SOMEBODY
WROTE
ID
LOVE
TO
SEE
A
EUROPEAN
NHL
DIVISION
BUT
CANT
SEE
IT
HAPPEN
FOR
SOME
TIME
THERES
SIMPLY
NOT
ENOUGH
FAN
INTEREST
AT
THE
MOMENT
IN
SEVERAL
CRUCIAL
MARKETS
LIKE
GERMANY
ITALY
AND
FRANCE
WHILE
SWEDEN
AND
FINLAND
PROBABLY
CANT
AFFORD
TO
SHELL
OUT
FOR
TICKETS
THE
WAY
AMERICANCANADIAN
FANS
DO
CALL
IT
THE
MINNESOTA
NORTH
STARS
EFFECT
SCANDINAVIANS
DO
LOVE
HOCKEY
BUT
WE
PREFER
TO
WATCH
LOCAL
INEXPENSIVE
HOCKEY
TO
THE
NHL
THE
NATIONAL
HOCKEY
LEAGUE
SHOULD
LOVE
THE
IDEA
THOUGH
PANEUROPEAN
TV
CHANNELS
SUCH
AS
EUROSPORT
COULD
BRING
IN
THE
MILLIONS
THE
AMERICAN
NETWORKS
LIKELY
NEVER
WILL
PAY
THIS
BRINGS
UP
A
QUESTION
I
ASKED
MYSELF
NO
ANSWER
WHEN
IT
WAS
MENTIONNED
THAT
THE
NHL
COULD
EXPAND
IN
EUROPE
WOULD
MOST
OF
THE
NORTHAMERICANS
NOW
PLAYING
IN
THE
NHL
BE
WILLING
TO
PLAY
FOR
A
TEAM
IN
EUROPE
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
HOCKEY
PLAYERS
ARE
NECESSARILY
INTERESTED
IN
EXPANDING
THEIR
CULTURAL
EXPERIENCE
TO
THAT
LEVEL
I
KNOW
I
WOULD
BUT
I
AM
NOT
A
PRO
HOCKEY
PLAYER
WHEN
ONE
RECALLS
SOME
PLAYERS
REMARKS
IN
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
IT
MAKES
ME
WONDER
HOW
A
EUROPEAN
EXPANSION
COULD
BE
ACHIEVED
REMEMBER
THESE
LINDROS
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
PLAY
IN
QUEBEC
FOR
MORE
THAN
REASONS
NICHOLLS
IN
EDMONTON
R
COURTNALL
WANTED
TO
BE
TRADED
TO
LA
ONLY
C
LEMIEUX
SAID
HE
WOULD
REFUSE
TO
GO
TO
EDMONTON
EARLIER
THIS
YEAR
I
KNOW
THERE
ARE
MANY
NONCULTURAL
REASONS
BEHIND
THESE
BUT
THERE
IS
MORE
SOME
AMERICAN
PLAYERS
WHO
PLAYED
FOR
THE
EXPOS
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
THE
FRENCH
FACT
AND
THAT
THE
CITY
WAS
NOT
QUITE
LIKE
THE
OTHER
US
CITIES
ONE
PLAYERS
WIFE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
HER
POINT
WENT
ON
TO
COMPLAIN
THAT
SHE
COULD
NOT
EVEN
FIND
HER
FAVORITE
BRAND
OF
NACHO
CHIPS
IN
MONTREAL
ANYBODY
KNOWS
WHAT
HAPPENED
WHEN
ALL
THESE
US
FOOTBALL
PLAYERS
MOVED
TO
LONDON
SPAIN
ETC
FOR
THE
ONE
YEAR
OF
THAT
NEW
FOOTBALL
LEAGUE
YEARS
AGO
I
WONDER
WHAT
THE
PLAYERS
ASSOCIATION
THINKS
ABOUT
GOING
TO
EUROPE
MYSELF
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
SOME
EUROPEAN
TEAMS
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
BE
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
DO
IT
