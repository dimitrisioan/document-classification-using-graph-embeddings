dan
gauthier
says
even
see
just
one
little
boston
fan
post
cept
for
the
bruins
fans
that
arent
cocky
i
guess
the
concept
of
a
fan
who
is
not
cocky
is
something
you
couldnt
possible
understand
eh
my
sig
has
nothing
to
do
with
cockiness
what
you
put
in
your
sig
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
article
as
i
learned
back
in
the
fall
the
hard
way
nah
i
doubt
you
really
would
youre
just
being
a
provocative
sob
as
usual
with
a
large
stick
up
your
but
of
course
i
mean
that
in
the
you
mean
butt
dont
you
not
but
nicest
way
sure
you
do
what
and
just
how
much
bragging
did
you
do
wobbie
on
rsbc
after
umass
beat
your
quakers
two
points
one
what
does
rsbc
have
to
do
with
hockey
secondly
umass
beat
my
quakers
hello
earth
here
are
you
responding
were
not
in
the
atlantic
or
whatever
you
wanna
call
it
were
in
the
big
now
the
was
too
weak
for
my
lady
lions
they
had
to
go
to
a
more
challenging
conference
it
didnt
pay
off
as
the
big
east
showed
them
a
thing
or
too
but
i
still
posted
on
a
regular
basis
and
tracked
all
the
womens
scores
with
reviews
throughout
the
tournament
it
wasnt
a
reason
to
stop
posting
btw
congratulations
should
go
to
the
sabres
they
are
playing
more
its
not
over
yet
if
anyone
has
a
chance
to
come
back
in
games
i
think
boston
can
do
it
but
i
still
see
buffalo
winning
in
diciplined
and
with
more
will
to
win
they
deserve
it
agreed
theyre
playing
tremendous
hockey
right
now
congatualtions
on
three
straight
buffalo
it
could
very
easily
be
boston
but
buffalo
has
come
up
tough
and
a
little
luck
you
never
see
a
penalty
in
ot
that
doesnt
have
both
sides
involved
in
a
playoff
game
never
never
never
