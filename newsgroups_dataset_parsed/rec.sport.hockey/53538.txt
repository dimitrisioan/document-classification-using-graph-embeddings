SAYS
CHANCES
THIS
YEAR
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
LIKE
WASHINGTON
IS
THE
ONLY
TEAM
THAT
CAN
STOP
THE
PENGUINS
FROM
WINNING
THEIR
NEXT
STANLEY
CUP
REALLY
I
THINK
BOTH
THE
ISLANDERS
AND
DEVILS
WOULD
HAVE
A
BETTER
CHANCE
AT
THE
PENGUINS
THAN
THE
CAPITALS
IMO
ROBBIE
PO
PGH
PENGUINS
IT
WONT
BE
EASY
BUT
IT
CONTACT
FOR
THE
STANLEY
CUP
WILL
HAVE
GREATER
REWARDS
PENN
STATE
LADY
LIONS
CHAMPIONS
MOUNTAINS
AND
VALLEYS
ARE
STRAIGHT
WINS
BETTER
THAN
NOTHING
AT
ALL
REALLY
WHAT
MAKES
YOU
THINK
THE
ISLANDERS
HAVE
A
BETTER
SHOT
THEY
COULDNT
EVEN
BEAT
THE
WHALERS
IN
TWO
GAMES
WELL
SINCE
YOURE
A
PENS
FANS
THE
WHOLE
QUESTION
IS
MOOT
I
THINK
THE
TEAMS
MOST
LIKELY
TO
BEAT
THE
PENS
ARE
THE
BRUINS
NORDIQUES
AND
BLACKHAWKS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THEY
CAN
REALLY
DO
IT
