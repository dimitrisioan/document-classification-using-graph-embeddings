is
who
do
you
think
is
better
defensively
ron
francis
of
the
penguins
is
although
he
has
points
while
jaromir
jagr
has
only
points
but
is
is
jagr
really
better
on
defense
than
francis
and
how
exactly
should
we
interpret
the
fact
that
mario
lemieux
has
by
far
the
highest
in
the
league
does
he
get
the
selke
as
well
as
the
ross
the
plusminus
does
not
measure
defense
alone
it
attempts
to
measure
a
players
total
contribution
to
the
team
effort
and
certainly
it
is
far
from
perfect
and
my
posting
never
implied
otherwise
all
that
my
posting
suggested
was
that
the
was
a
better
indicator
of
a
players
effectiveness
when
examined
in
the
context
of
that
players
teams
performance
than
mere
scoring
totals
alone
and
as
for
mario
getting
the
selke
why
not
after
doug
gilmour
i
would
rather
have
lemieux
on
the
ice
in
any
situation
other
than
as
an
enforcer
obvi
ously
than
any
player
in
the
game
i
used
to
call
the
selke
the
bob
gainey
award
it
came
about
as
a
result
of
the
statement
made
by
anatoli
tarasov
bob
gainey
is
the
best
hockey
player
in
the
world
i
am
sure
that
tarasov
was
either
misquoted
originally
or
had
a
tiny
bit
too
much
vodka
and
was
toying
with
a
reporter
in
any
event
the
nhl
decided
to
honour
one
dimensional
checkers
along
with
one
dimen
sional
scorers
maybe
the
league
should
start
awarding
the
doug
gil
mour
award
anually
to
the
leagues
most
effective
allround

cordially
