this
is
wrong
among
lemieuxs
points
we
do
not
know
how
many
are
power
play
points
we
may
be
able
to
find
out
how
many
pp
goal
he
scored
but
not
how
many
pp
assist
he
accumulated
we
also
dont
know
the
times
he
was
on
the
ice
but
not
credited
on
the
goals
the
pens
scored
that
is
what
my
point
really
was
there
is
not
straight
dependency
between
the
and
scored
points
apparently
most
of
the
netters
have
realized
it
by
themselves
