RANGERS
ARE
AN
EMBARRASSMENT
I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
NY
RANGERS
WOULD
FORCE
ITS
PLAYERS
TO
GO
TO
BINGHAMTOM
TO
PLAY
IN
THE
AHL
PLAYOFFS
INSTEAD
OF
LETTING
THEM
REPRESENT
THEIR
COUNTRIES
IN
THE
WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS
ANDERRSON
AND
ZUBOV
ARE
WAITING
FOR
THE
NHL
TO
MAKE
A
DECISION
TO
THIS
WHILE
KOVALEV
HAS
GIVEN
IN
AND
GONE
DOWN
TO
THE
MINORS
THE
RANGERS
ARE
A
DISGRACE
PS
IT
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
THAT
NEIL
SMITH
WAS
VERY
MUCH
AGAINST
THE
HIRING
OF
MIKE
KEENAN
HOW
LONG
WILL
SMITH
BE
IN
NY
FOR
THE
GODFATHER
