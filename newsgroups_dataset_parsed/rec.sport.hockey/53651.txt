FLAMES
TRULY
BRUTAL
IN
LOSS
AS
THE
SUBJECT
SUGGESTS
THE
FLAMES
WERE
NOT
IMPRESSIVE
THIS
AFTERNOON
DROPPING
A
DECISION
TO
THE
LA
KINGS
MOST
OF
THE
FLAMES
NEGLECTED
TO
SHOW
UP
ESPECIALLY
IN
THEIR
OWN
ZONE
AS
THE
KINGS
HIT
AT
LEAST
FIVE
POSTS
THE
FLAMES
BEST
LINE
WAS
PROBABLY
SKRUDLANDPASLAWSKIBERUBE
WHICH
TELLS
HOW
BAD
THE
FLAMES
WERE
GARY
SUTER
SCORED
A
GREAT
GOAL
IN
FACT
ALL
THREE
FLAME
GOALS
WERE
SCORED
BY
DMEN
YAWNEY
AND
DAHLQUIST
GETTING
THE
OTHERS
BUT
ALSO
MADE
SOME
BONEHEAD
PLAYS
FOR
THE
KINGS
PAT
CONACHER
WAS
ESPECIALLY
IMPRESSIVE
THE
GAMES
WAS
VERY
CHIPPY
AS
DAN
MIROUELLI
LOST
CONTROL
EARLY
AND
NEVER
RECOVERED
IT
THERE
WERE
HIGHSTICKS
CROSSCHECKS
PUNCHES
HITS
FROM
BEHIND
FLEURY
GOT
A
GAME
MISCONDUCT
FOR
RUBBING
OUT
WARREN
RYCHEL
FROM
BEHIND
FLAMES
DOMINATED
THE
GAME
PHYSICALLY
BUT
FAILED
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
DUE
TO
HORRENDOUS
DEFENSIVE
LAPSES
I
DONT
THINK
VERNON
CAN
BE
BLAMED
FOR
ANY
OF
THE
GOALS
CALGARY
WENT
WITH
DMEN
AS
ROGER
JOHANSSON
PLAYED
LW
HE
LOOKED
LOST
IMHO
I
HOPE
KING
INSERTS
CHRIS
LINDBERGH
PAUL
KRUSE
OR
SERGEI
MAKAROV
FOR
WEDNESDAYS
GAME
GRETZKY
LEFT
THE
GAME
IN
THE
PERIOD
WITH
A
CHARLEYHORSE
NO
IDEA
HOW
SERIOUS
HE
DIDNT
RETURN
I
STILL
THINK
THE
FLAMES
SHOULD
WIN
THIS
SERIES
BUT
THEY
BETTER
BUCKLE
DOWN
VLAD
THE
IMPALER
