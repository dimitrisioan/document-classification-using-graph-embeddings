WASHELSINKISTOCKHOLM
NHL
EXPANSION
IN
TERVIOKATKHELSINKIFI
WRITES
NOW
WHAT
IF
THE
TWO
TEAMS
WERE
MERGED
THIS
HAS
BEEN
PROPOSED
IN
TAMPERE
WITH
ILVES
LYNX
AND
TAPPARA
AXE
THE
FANS
WOULDNT
TAKE
IT
THEY
RATHER
SEE
THEIR
TEAMS
OUT
OF
THE
PLAYOFFS
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
OR
EVEN
RELEGATED
THAN
MERGED
ITS
NOT
THAT
DIFFICULT
TO
UNDERSTAND
ITS
JUST
LIKE
HERE
IN
HELSINKI
YOU
GROW
UP
BEING
EITHER
A
JOKERIT
OR
HIFK
FAN
THE
OTHER
TEAM
IS
THE
LAST
TEAM
IN
THE
WORLD
YOU
WOULD
SUPPORT
IM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
HATE
BUT
ABOUT
EXTREMELY
DEEPLY
ROOTED
RIVALRY
DEEPLY
ROOTED
RIVALRY
AHEM
JOKERIT
HAVE
BEEN
AROUND
SINCE
AND
JOINED
THE
TOP
FLIGHT
ONLY
IN
THE
EARLY
HELSINGFORS
IFK
HAVE
BEEN
AROUND
SINCE
BUT
FANS
ONLY
STARTED
TAKING
HOCKEY
SERIOUSLY
IN
THE
SO
I
THINK
YOURE
EXAGERATING
HERE
HOWEVER
ITS
BEEN
PROVED
THAT
BOTH
FAN
GROUPS
CAN
CHEER
THE
SAME
TEAM
THATS
THE
FINNISH
NATIONAL
TEAM
MAYBE
THATS
HOW
YOU
COULD
SET
UP
A
HUGE
FRANCHISE
IN
FINLAND
NO
ONE
HAS
EVER
SAID
THAT
THE
TEAM
MUST
BE
CALLED
AFTER
ONE
CITY
OR
PLAY
ALL
ITS
GAMES
ON
ONE
ARENA
JUST
ONE
TEAM
FINLAND
AND
TEAM
SWEDEN
IN
THE
NHL
JUST
WOULDNT
MAKE
ANY
SENSE
WE
HAVE
WAY
MORE
TALENT
THAN
OF
THE
TOTAL
OF
NORTH
AMERICAN
TALENT
AFTER
A
COUPLE
OF
SEASONS
YOU
WOULD
NEVER
SEE
THE
CUP
GOING
ANYWHERE
OUTSIDE
THE
NORDIC
PRESUMING
THAT
OUR
TEAMS
WOULD
HAVE
THE
ADVANTAGE
IN
DRAFTING
LOCAL
TALENT
AS
PROOPOSED
THATS
A
RATHER
BOLD
CLAIM
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
HOW
SUCCESSFUL
THE
CANADIAN
AMERICAN
OLYMPIC
TEAMS
HAVE
BEEN
AND
THEYVE
HAD
TO
PLAY
ACCORDING
TO
OUR
SET
OF
RULES
AND
ON
INTERNATIONAL
ICE
THE
OLYMPIC
TEAMS
CONTAINED
ABOUT
AS
MUCH
TALENT
AS
YOUR
AVERAGE
EXPANSION
TEAM
CANADA
HAD
ERIC
LINDROS
SEAN
BURKE
JOE
JUNEAU
AND
CHRIS
KONTOS
ANOTHER
FOUR
OR
FIVE
HAVE
BEEN
DEEP
SUBS
IN
THE
NHL
AS
FOR

YANKS
KEITH
TKACHUK
SCOTT
LACHANCE
BRET
HEDICAN
SHAWN
MCEACHERN
STEVE
HEINTZE
TED
DONATO
JOE
SACCO
AND
BILL
GUERIN
HAVE
BEEN
LINE
PLAYERS
IN
THE
NHL
WHILE
ROBB
STAUBER
HAS
DONE
WELL
FOR
THE
KINGS
IN
GOAL
NOTHING
MORE
IN
FACT
IM
SURE
THAT
AN
ALLSTAR
TEAM
ASSEMBLED
FROM
THE
BEST
FINNISH
LEAGUE
TEAMS
WOULD
DO
NO
BETTER
IN
THE
NHL
THAN
HARTFORD
OR
TAMPA
BAY
CURRENTLY
ARE
DOING
BUT
WHAT
HAPPENS
IF
ALL
TOPCLASS
FINNISH
SWEDISH
PLAYERS
GRADUALLY
END
UP
WITH
HELSINKI
STOCKHOLM
AS
THE
NORTH
AMERICANBASED
ONES
GRADUALLY
RETIRE
AND
NO
CANADIANAMERICAN
TEAM
IS
ALLOWED
TO
DRAFT
NEW
PLAYERS
FROM
SCANDINAVIA
HERE
IS

ARE
RIGHT
UP
THERE
WITH
ANY
FIVEMAN
UNIT
PITTSBURGH
CO
HAVE
BUT
I
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
ABOUT
THE
HOMEBASED
FINNISH
PLAYERS
THE
NATIONAL
TEAM
DID
WELL
IN
THE
CANADA
CUP
AND
WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIPS
LARGELY
DUE
TO
THE
EFFORTS
OF
MARKUS
KETTERER
THE
GOALIE
OR
THE
PLAYERS
LISTED
ABOVE
AND
LUCK
THERES
PRESUMABLY
A
LOT
OF
DECENT
PLAYERS
IN
FINLAND
THAT
WOULDNT
BE
SUPERSTARS
AT
THE
HIGHEST
LEVEL
BUT
STILL
VALUABLE
ROLE
PLAYERS
HOWEVER
MY
GUESS
WOULD
BE
THAT
THE
FINNISH
CANADA
CUP
TEAM
WOULD
BE
A
TEAM
IN
THE
NHL
SWEDEN
IS
EASIER
TO
JUDGE
BECAUSE
THEY
HAVE
MORE
PLAYERS
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
THEIR
POINTS
TOTAL
PLAYERS
IS
SEVEN
MORE
THAN
OTTAWAS
TOP
PLAYERS
COMBINED
IF
WE
ESTIMATE
THERE
ARE
SIX
MORE
NHL
REGULARS
BACK
HOME
IN
SWEDEN
AN
ALLSWEDISH
TEAM
WOULD
ASSEMBLE
ABOUT
SKILL
POINTS
DEDUCTING
SOME
POINTS
FROM
PITTSBURGH
NY
RANGERS
AND
OTHER
TEAMS
THAT
RELY
ON
SWEDISH
PLAYERS
THE
SWEDISH
TEAM
WOULD
FINISH
IN
SIXTH
PLACE
ABOUT
AS
HIGH
AS
BOSTON
VANCOUVER
CALGARY
AND
MONTREAL
ON
PAPER
SO
THE
DYNASTY
TALK
ISNT
COMPLETELY
UNFOUNDED
HERE
AN
ALLFINNISHALLSWEDISH
TEAM
MIGHT
HAVE
AN
ADVANTAGE
BECAUSE
THE
PLAYERS
WOULD
BE
PLAYING
AT
HOME
HALF
OF
THE
TIME
WONT
HAVE
TO
ADAPT
TO
A
FOREIGN
COUNTRY
AND
A
FOREIGN
LANGUAGE
AND
PRESUMABLY
PLAY
THE
WIDEOPEN
EUROPEAN
VARIANT
OF
HOCKEY
RATHER
THAN
HAVE
TO
LEARN
THE
NORTH
AMERICAN
CHECKING
GAME
HOWEVER
IF
FREE
AGENCY
BECOMES
A
FACTOR
THE
TOP
SCANDINAVIAN
PLAYERS
STILL
MIGHT
END
UP
PLAYING
FOR
LARGEMARKET
TEAMS
AFTER
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
THE
SAME
WAY
EDMONTONS
DYNASTY
CRUMBLED
IN
THE
LATE
SOME
FRINGE
PLAYERS
LIKELY
WILL
BE
DRAFTED
BY
OTHER
NHL
TEAMS
AS
HAVING
AN
EXCLUSIVE
TALENT
POOL
MIGHT
BE
A
BIT
UNFAIR
AFTER
ALL
ID
SETTLE
FOR
A
COMPROMISE
PROHIBIT
ALL
EUROPEAN
TEAMS
FROM
SIGNING
A
NORTH
AMERICAN
DURING
THE
FIRST
TWO
ROUNDS
BUT
ALLOW
THEM
TO
KEEP
THEIR
