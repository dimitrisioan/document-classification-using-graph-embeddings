WRITES
ON
TUESDAY
WHEN
IT
WAS
RAINING
IN
CHICAGO
ESPN
PROVIDED
BONUS
HOCKEY
COVERAGE
NOW
IT
SEEMS
AS
THOUGH
SOME
FANS
ARE
TICKED
OFF
THAT
THE
NYWASH
OT
WAS
REPLACED
WITH
THE
ANGELS
GAME
PEOPLE
MUST
REALIZE
THAT
THERE
ARE
MORE
BASEBALL
FANS
INSTEAD
OF
HOCKEY
FANS
IN
THE
US
THE
BASEBALL
GAME
WAS
SCHEDULED
TO
AIR
AND
ADVERTISERS
MONEY
WAS
PAID
SO
THEY
CANT
SKIP
THE
BASEBALL
GAME
WHY
DONT
YOU
PEOPLE
CHILL
OUT
AND
ENJOY
WHATEVER
COVERAGE
YOU
CAN
GET
WELL
PARTLY
BECAUSE
I
AS
AN
ARDENT
FAN
OF
BOTH
SPORTS
WOULD
RATHER
SEE
GAME
OF
THE
NHL
PLAYOFFS
THAN
GAME
OF
OF
THE
MLB
SEASON
EVEN
IF
THE
BB
GAME
INVOLVES
THE
RED
SOX
ESPN
MAY
HAVE
HAD
CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
PART
BUT
ITS
A
BIT
INACCURATE
TO
CALL
US
SELFISH
JUST
BECAUSE
WE
WANT
TO
WATCH
THE
WATCH
THE
GAME
WE
LOVE
AM
I
AS
A
BASEBALL
FAN
SELFISH
WHEN
I
GET
PISSED
A
CBS
FOR
SHOWING
APPROXIMATELY
ONE
GAME
PER
MONTH
I
DONT
THINK
SO
WHILE
ESPN
MAY
HAVE
CONTRACTUAL
OBLIGATIONS
WE
AS
THEIR
CONSUMERS
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
VOICE
OUR
DISPLEASURE
WITH
HOW
THEY
ARE
SERVING
US
THERES
CERTAINLY
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
THAT
