RUSSIA
PROBABLY
MADE
THEIR
BEST
GAME
OF
THE

BUT
YET
THERE
WASNT
ENOUGH
TO
WIN
AGAINST
THE
EFFECTIVE
CANADIANS
GALLEY
TOOK
A
SLAP

TREFILOV
RUSSIA
WON
THE

IN

I
AGREE
THE

IN
THIS

IN
PART
ALSO
TUGNUTT
KARIYA
HAD
A
FAR
BETTER
GAME
NOW
THAN
VS
THE
SWEDES
AND
HE
WAS
VERY
IMPRESSIVE
KARIYA
GOT
THE
PLACE
IN
THE

WITH
LINDROS
AFTER
MIKE
GARTNER
WENT
OUT
WITH
A
RIBINJURY
EARLY
IN

LEAD
