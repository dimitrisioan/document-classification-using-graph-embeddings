BUFFALO
IS
UP
IS
THE
SERIES
WITH
BOSTON
AND
THE
REASONGRANT
FUHR
FUHR
IS
PLAYOFF
HUNGRY
AND
HES
PROVING
ONCE
AGAIN
WHY
THEY
CALL
HIM
MONEY
GOALTENDER
FUHR
MIGHT
NOT
BE
ONE
OF
THE
BEST
GOALTENDERS
IN
THE
LEAGUE
ANYMORE
STATISTICALLY
AT
LEAST
BUT
HES
PROVING
THAT
HE
CAN
MAKE
THE
BIG
SAVE
AT
THE
RIGHT
TIME
THE
LEAFS
SHOULD
HAVE
KEPT
FUHR
AND
PROBABLY
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
A
CHANCE
AGAINST
POWERHOUSE
DETROIT
BUT
AGAINWHERE
WAS
ANDREYCHOKE
IN
GAME
I
APPLAUDED
THE
SABRES
FOR
MAKING
THE
DEAL
TO
GET
FUHR
SPECIFICALLY
BECAUSE
I
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
HELP
THEM
WIN
AT
LEAST
ONE
PLAYOFF
SERIES
HOWEVER
I
DONT
THINK
THE
LEAFS
CAN
BE
FAULTED
EITHERTHERE
IS
NOTHING
TO
SAY
THAT
FELIX
WONT
BE
WINNING
PLAYOFF
SERIES
BY
HIMSELF
IN
YEARS
TO
COME
ANYWAY
DOES
ANYBODY
ELSE
FIND
IT
IRONIC
THAT
FUHR
IS
UP
AGAINST
MOOG
OR
AT
LEAST
HE
WAS
UNTIL
A
GUY
NAMED
ALEX
SHOWED
UP
