leafs
win
thank
you
potvin
its
about
time
the
boys
got
it
together
they
were
outworked
and
outplayed
by
the
wings
in
the
first
two
games
but
burns
must
have
kicked
their
behinds
cause
they
sure
came
out
in
full
gear
or
is
that
high
gear
in
game
except
for
a
minute
stretch
in
the
period
they
outskated
and
outworked
the
wings
please
dont
flame
this
statement
cos
you
know
its
true
i
have
to
admit
that
goaltending
was
the
key
potvin
kept
the
leafs
ahead
during
the
sleepy
stretch
the
leafs
went
through
in
the
he
also
kept
the
rebounds
to
a
minimum
something
that
cost
cheveldae
goals
clark
even
looked
like
he
had
stopped
moping
first
star
although
i
still
dont
know
why
he
was
so
flat
in
games
and
if
the
leafs
play
the
same
style
and
can
keep
the
pace
they
had
in
game
they
may
actually
have
a
chance
of
winning
this
series
a
slim
chance
but
a
chanceim
no
rmwhere
is
he
anyways
haha
