MAJOR
LEAGUE
BASEBALL
HAS
TOLD
THE
BLUE
JAYS
AND
THE
EXPOS
NOT
TO
SIGN
OSCAR
LINARES
I
THINK
THAT
IS
HIS
NAME
LINARES
HAS
NOT
DEFECTED
AS
I
POINTED
OUT
MLB
REQUIRES
THAT
THE

DEFECT
FIRST
CANADA
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
RESTRICTIONS
AGAINST
CUBANS
THAT
THE
US
HAS
AND
OTHER
MAJOR
LEAGUE
TEAMS
HAVE
TOLD
THE
CANADIAN
TEAMS
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BE
VERY
UNHAPPY
IF
THE
EXPOS
OR
THE
BLUE
JAYS
WOULD
DO
THIS
WHAT
A
SURPRISE
AS

WONT

A

SIGN
IT
SEEMS
PERFECTLY
REASONABLE
TO
ME
CUBANS
PLAYERS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
DEFECT
TO
PLAY
IN
CANADA
AND
COULD
PLAY
THE
HOME
GAMES
FOR
THE
EXPOS
AND
BLUE
JAYS
WITHOUT
ANY
TROUBLE
EXCEPT
THAT
MLB
WONT
ALLOW
IT
WHICH
IS
ALL
I
EVER
