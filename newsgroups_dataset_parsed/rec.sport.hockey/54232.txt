KEITH
KELLER
WRITES
I
PREFER
TO
WATCH
HOCKEY
THAN
SEEING
SHOTS
OF
FELIX
POTVIN
SLASHING
AND
SPEARING
DINO
CICCERELLI
STANDING
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
HE
HAS
EVERY
RIGHT
TO
STAND
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
NET
JUST
NOT
IN
THE
CREASE
YES
HE
DOES
BUT
THE
GOALIE
SURE
AS
HELL
DOESNT
WANT
HIM
THERE
WHEN
I
PLAYED
ROLLER
HOCKEY
BOY
DO
I
MISS
THOSE
DAYS
AS
A
GOALIE
I
WOULD
SCREAM
AT
MY
DEFENSE
TO
CLEAR
GUYS
OUT
OF
THE
SLOT
I
DONT
CARE
IF
HES
IN
THE
CREASE
OR
NOT
GET
HIM
THE
HELL
AWAY
FROM
ME
SO
I
CAN
SEE
THE
BALL
YES
ROLLER
HOCKEY
REMEMBER
AND
IF
THERE
WAS
NOBODY
AROUND
TO
CLEAR
THE
SLOT
THEN
ID
DO
IT
MYSELF
BY
PUSHING
THE
OFFENDING
PLAYERHARD
I
HATE
PEOPLE
IN
MY
WAY
WHEN
IM
THE
GOALIE
AND
I
AM
SURE
FELIX
DOES
TOO
I
SHOULD
SAY
THAT
I
DIDNT
SEE
THE
INCIDENT
SO
IF
POTVIN
REALLY
SWUNG
THE
STICK
BIG
TIME
THEN
THATS
NOT
RIGHT
BUT
HE
CAN
MOVE
PEOPLE
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
HES
A
PLAYER
ON
THE
ICE
TOO

CHAMPS
IN
THIS
CORNER
LETS
GO
QUAKERS
WEIGHING
IN
AT
ALMOST
EVERY
WEIGHT
IMAGINABLE
LIFE
AND
ALL
THAT
SURROUNDS
IT
BLUES
TRAVELER
I
HAVE
TO
AGREE
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
WITH
THIS
VIEW
I
DONT
LIKE
TO
SEE
STICKWORK
BUT
YOU
HAVE
TO
CLEAR
PLAYERS
AWAY
FROM
IN
FRONT
MY
PERSONAL
FAVORITE
MOVE
IM
A
GOALIE
TOO
IS
TO
GIVE
THE
OFFEDING
PLAYER
A
GOOD
WHACK
ON
THE
BACK
OF
THEIR
SKATES
WHEN
THE
REF
ISNT
LOOKING
MAKES
EM
GO
DOWN
LIKE
A
TON
OF
BRICKS
BUT
DOESNT
CAUSE
INJURIES
UNLESS
THEY
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
FALL
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
HITTING
THE
BLADES
HERE
NOT
THE
FOOT
IT
ALSO
MAKES
THE
PLAYER
YOU
HIT
AND
ANYONE
WHO
SEES
REALLY
MAD
AND
APT
TO
TAKE
A
STUPID
RETALIATION
PENALTY
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
ALSO
LEAVES
YOUR
BLOCKER
OUT
OF
POSITION
FOR
A
SHORT
TIMEI
DONT
DO
THIS
IF
A
SHOT
IS
LIKELY
ON
THE
SHORT
SIDE
HMMMAYBE
I
SHOULD
MAIL
POTVIN
THIS
METHOD
IN
FRENCH
AND
WITH
HELPFUL
DIAGRAMS
OF
COURSE
IT
SURE
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
SEE
CICCERELLI
WHO
I
HAVE
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
RESPECT
FOR
BTW
HES
NOT
A
BIG
GUY
BUT
HE
PLAYS
HUGE
FALL
ON
HIS
BACK
A
FEW
TIMES
BARFLY
