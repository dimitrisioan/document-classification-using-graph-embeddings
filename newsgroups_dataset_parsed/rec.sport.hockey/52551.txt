ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
THE
JETS
USE
THE
BREAKAWAY
PASS
SCHEME
TO
CREATE
A
SCORING
SENSATION
IN
ORDER
TO
GENERATE
INTEREST
IF
TEAMS
SCORE
AS
MANY
OR
MORE
GOALS
AGAINST
WINNIPEG
WHEN
SELANNE
IS
ON
THE
ICE
AS
WINNIPEG
SCORES
WHEN
HE
IS
ON
THE
ICE
THEN
I
CANT
SEE
HOW
HIS
CONTRIBUTION
CAN
BE
DESCRIBED
AS
IMPRESSIVE
IMPLICITLY
YOU
ARE
ASSUMING
THAT
GOALS
SCORED
AGAINST
WINNIPEG
WITH
SELANNE
ON
THE
ICE
CAN
BE
BLAMED
ON
HIMROGER
HE
IS
A
FORWARD
WINNIPEG
HAS
A
LOUSY
DEFENSIVE
RECORD
ANYWAY
LETS
PUT
IT
ANOTHER
WAY
JOHN
CULLENS
IS
TERRIBLE
WHATS
YOUR
EXCUSE
FOR
HIM
THAT
HIS
POWERPLAY
POINTS
DONT
COUNT
NEITHER
DO
SELANNES
THE
OBJECT
OF
THE
GAME
IS
NOT
TO
FEED
SELANNE
IT
IS
TO
WIN
AND
FEEDING
SELANNE
DOES
NOT
CONTRIBUTE
IN
ANY
MEANINGFUL
WAY
TO
WINNING
KNOWLEDGEABLE
HOCKEY
OBSERVERS
THE
WORLD
OVER
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
FEEDING
SELANNE
SO
HE
CAN
SCORE
DOES
CONTRIBUTE
IN
A
MEANINGFUL
WAY
TO
WINNING
PAT
BURNS
WOULDNT
HAVE
A
GOAL
SUCK
LIKE
THIS
ON
HIS
TEAM
YOURE
WORRIED
ABOUT
TEEMU
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
GLENN
ANDERSON
ON
YOUR
TEAM
WE
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
SELANNE
DOES
BEST
WE
DO
KNOW
WHAT
JETS
MANAGEMENT
WANTS
AND
AGAIN
THE
OBJECT
OF
THE
EXERCISE
IS
NOT
TO
ALLOW
SELANNE
TO
DO
WHAT
HE
DOES
BEST
IT
IS
TO
WIN
HOCKEY
GAMES
WHAT
HE
DOES
BEST
IS
SCORESO
I
REFER
YOU
TO
MY
COMMENT
ABOVE
AS
IT
IS
NOW
SELANNE
IS
A
GRANDSTANDING
GOAL
SUCK
DID
YOU
SEE
THE
WAY
HE
PARADES
AROUND
WITH
HIS
ARMS
OUTSTRETCHED
AFTER
SCORING
A
GOAL
YOU
WOULD
THINK
THE
MESSIAH
HAD
RETURNED
NOPE
DIDNT
SEE
IT
I
WAS
TOO
BUSY
WATCHING
FOLIGNO
JUMP
UP
AND
DOWN
AFTER
HIS
GOAL
