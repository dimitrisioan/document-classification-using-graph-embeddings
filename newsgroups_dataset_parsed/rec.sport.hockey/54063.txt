STEVEN
JAY
GIBBLE
WRITES
MARIO
IS
THE
MICHAEL
JORDAN
OF
HOCKEY
ALL
THAT
FUCKER
HAS
TO
DO
IS
FALL
ON
THE
ICE
AND
THE
CLOSET
GUY
TO
HIM
GETS
AT
LEAST
LAST
NIGHT
IN
THE
GAME
BETWEEN
NJ
AND
PITT
HE
WAS
BEING
PUSHED
WHILE
SKATING
ACROSS
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
GOAL
WHILE
TRYING
TO
GET
A
SHOT
OFF
THE
GUY
ON
HIM
WAS
DOING
A
GOOD
JOB
SO
HE
GOT
OFF
A
WEAK
SHOT
BUT
THEN
HE
DECIDED
TO
FALL
TO
THE
ICE
THEN
THE
FUCKING
REFVAN
HELLOAMEND
CALLED
THE
GUY
FOR
HOLDING
THEY
REPLAYED
THE
PLAY
AND
MY
ROOMATEWHO
IS
CLUELESS
ABOUT
HOCKEY
WANTED
TO
KNOW
WHAT
THE
NJ
GUY
DID
TO
GET
A
CALL
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
SO
FUCKING
OBVIOUS
THE
NJ
PLAYER
HAD
BOTH
HANDS
ON
HIS
STICK
AND
NO
HE
DID
NOT
TRIP
HIM
IT
IS
SIMPLE
MARIO
GETS
TOUCHED
HE
FALLS
TO
THE
ICE
AUTOMATIC
BUT
THE
THING
THAT
REALLY
PISSED
ME
OFF
IS
PITT
SCORED
THE
OR
GOAL
I
DONT
REMEMBER
ON
THE
RESULTING
PP
AND
EVENTUALLY
WON
HIS
DIVINGCALLS
MAKES
A
HUGE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
OUTCOME
OF
A
GAME
ALL
AGREEING
OR
DISAGREEING
REPLIES
ARE
WELCOMED
STEVE
WE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
WATCHING
TWO
DIFFERENT
GAMES
THE
DEVIL
HAD
ONE
HAND
ON
MARIOS
ELBOW
AND
PULLING
THE
ELBOW
CAUSED
MARIO
TO
FALL
SO
THE
CALL
WAS
APPROPRIATE
USING
CLUELESS
PEOPLE
TO
SUBSTANTIATE
YOUR
CLAIMS
DOESNT
GIVE
ME
A
LOT
OF
CONFIDENCE
IN
YOUR
CALL
EITHER
NEXT
TIME
CONSIDER
GETTING
A
SECOND
OPINION
FROM
A
CLUEFUL
OBSERVER
OR
MAYBE
ALL
THOSE
AVAILABLE
DISAGREED
