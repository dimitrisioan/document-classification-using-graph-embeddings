ANTONIO
PERA
WRITES
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THE
NEW
TEAM
IN
MIAMII
CANT
SAY
SOUTH
FLORIDA
ITS
TOO
LONG
MAKES
ME
THINK
OF
AN
INTERESTING
QUESTION
CAN
YOU
SELL
THE
HISPANIC
COMMUNITY
ON
HOCKEY
MIAMI
IS
HISPANIC
THIS
COMMUNITY
HAS
NO
EXPERIENCE
AND
NO
PREVIOUS
EXPOSURE
TO
HOCKEY
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
THE
TEAMS
IN
NY
AND
LA
WHICH
ALSO
HAVE
BIG
HISPANIC
GROUPS
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
TRY
TO
WOO
THIS
GROUP
WHAT
WILL
MIAMI
DO
COULD
THEY
GET
SPANISHLANGUAGE
TV
AND
RADIO
COVERAGE
YOULL
HAVE
A
HARD
TIME
SELLING
ANY
SPORT
TO
A
COMMUNITY
THAT
CANT
PLAY
IT
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
AVAILABILITY
OR
FINANCIAL
REASONS
HOCKEY
IS
PRETTY
MUCH
A
SPORT
FOR
THE
WHITE
AND
WELL
OFF
WELL
SUFFICE
TO
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
A
SPORT
FOR
THOSE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
THE
SUBSTANTIAL
INVESTMENT
IN
EQUIPMENT
ETC
BUT
HERES
SOMETHING
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
INLINE
SKATES
AND
ROAD
HOCKEY
COULD
CONTRIBUTE
TO
A
RISE
IN
AWARENESS
OF
ICE
HOCKEY
I
WOULD
ARGUE
THIS
IS
HAVING
AN
EFFECT
HERE
KIDS
PLAY
ICE
HOCKEY
IN
THE
WINTER
AND
ROAD
HOCKEY
IN
THE
SUMMER
WITH
INLINE
SKATES
