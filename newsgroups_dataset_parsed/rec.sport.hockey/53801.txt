PODEIN
IS
AN
INTERESTING
CASEBECAUSE
HE
WAS
ELIGIBLE
TO
PLAY
IN
CAPE
BRETON
IN
THE
AHL
PLAYOFFS
LIKE
KOVALEV
ZUBOV
AND
ANDERSSONOBVIOUSLY
SATHER
AND
POCKLINGTON
ARE
NOT
THE
TOTAL
SCROOGES
EVERYONE
MAKES
THEM
OUT
TO
BECERTAINLY
IN
THIS
CASE
THEYVE
MASSIVELY
OUTCLASSED
PARAMOUNT
AND
THE
NEW
YORK
RANGERS
WHAT
IS
THE
POLICY
REGARDING
PLAYERS
AND
THE
MINOR
LEAGUE
PLAYOFFS
VERSUS
WC
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
RANGERS
ARE
HOLDING
BACK
KOVALEV
ZUBOV
AND
ANDERSSON
FOR
BINGHAMTON
BUT
I
ALSO
KNOW
THAT
THE
WHALERS
WANTED
MICHAEL
NYLANDER
TO
PLAY
FOR
SPRINGFIELD
WHILE
NYLANDER
WANTED
TO
PLAY
FOR
SWEDEN
THE
WHALERS
ALLOWED
THE
NHL
TO
DECIDE
AND
THE
NHL
CHOSE
THE
WCS
HOW
DOES
THIS
DIFFER
FROM
THE
RANGERS
AND
OILERS
DID
THE
WHALERS
HAVE
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
LEAGUE
OR
COULD
THEY
HAVE
FORCED
NYLANDER
TO
PLAY
IN
SPRINGFIELD
OBVIOUSLY
IT
IS
ULTIMATELY
THE
TEAMS
CHOICETHE
NHL
WOULD
OBVIOUSLY
PREFER
NOT
TO
ANNOY
THE
EUROPEAN
HOCKEY
FEDERATIONS
BUT
THE
NHL
RIGHT
NOW
CANNOT
FORCE
NHL
TEAMS
TO
FREE
THEIR
PLAYERSTHE
WHALERS
PROBABLY
DID
IT
THIS
WAY
SO
AS
TO
NOT
ANNOY
THEIR
FARM
TEAM
AFFILIATE
