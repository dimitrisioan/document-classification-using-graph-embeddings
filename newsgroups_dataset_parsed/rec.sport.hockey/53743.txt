RE
NHL
TEAM
IN
MILWAUKEE
CHARLIE
BETZ
CBETZROMULUSCRAYCOM
WRITES
AFTER
READING
SOME
OF
THE
REPORTS
OF
POSSIBLE
NHL
MOVES
TO
MILWAUKEE
OR
THAT
MILWAUKEE
SHOULD
HAVE
AN
NHL
TEAM
I
THOUGHT
ID
PASS
ALONG
A
STORY
I
HEARD
RECENTLY
THIS
IS
SECOND
HAND
SO
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TRUE
IT
IS
BUT
I
HAVE
NO
REASON
TO
DOUBT
IT
EITHER
BRADLEY
CENTER
IN
MILWAUKEE
IS
HOME
TO
THE
MILWAUKEE
ADMIRALS
MINOR
LEAUGE
HOCKEY
TEAM
THE
OWNER
OF
THE
ADMIRALS
SORRY
I
CANT
REMEMBER
HIS
NAME
EITHER
OWNS
OR
AT
LEAST
SHELLED
OUT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
FUNDS
TO
BUILD
THE
BRADLEY
CENTER
LLOYD
PETTIT
SUPPOSEDLY
HE
WAS
APPROACHED
BY
THE
NHL
ABOUT
AN
EXPANSION
FRANCHISE
BUT
TURNED
IT
DOWN
BECAUSE
HE
THOUGHT
THE
FRANCHISE
FEE
OF
MILLION
WAS
TOO
HIGH
LIKE
I
SAID
I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
THIS
STORY
IS
TRUE
OR
JUST
A
RUMOR
BUT
IF
ITS
TRUE
DONT
LOOK
FOR
AN
NHL
TEAM
IN
MILWAUKEE
ANYTIME
SOON
THE
ADMIRALS
ARENT
GOING
TO
BE
FORCED
OUT
OF
THE
BUILDING
AND
YOU
WONT
SEE
AN
NHL
CLUB
AND
A
MINOR
LEAGUE
CLUB
IN
THE
SAME
BUILDING
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
THE
NBAS
MILWAUKEE
BUCKS
PLAY
THERE
AS
WELL
YES
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
HE
REFUSED
TO
BUY
A
FRANCHISE
FROM
THE
NHL
FOR
BUT
AT
THE
TIME
THE
REASON
WAS
THAT
THE
ESTABLISHED
MARKET
FOR
TEAMS
WAS
MUCH
LESS
THAN
THAT
HE
FELT
THAT
NO
ONE
WOULD
PAY
FOR
AN
EXPANSION
TEAM
AND
THAT
HE
WOULD
SIMPLY
WAIT
TO
BUY
AN
EXISTING
FRANCHISE
FOR
LESS
THAN
THAT
BUT
THE
MARKET
FOOLED
HIM
AND
TEAMS
HAVE
BEEN
CREATED
FOR
APIECE
IN
THE
LAST
THREE
YEARS
AND
EVEN
THE
EXISTING
TEAMS
CANT
BE
MOVED
FOR
LESS
THAN
AND
I
DOUBT
THAT
HE
COULD
GET
ONE
FOR
THAT
LITTLE
PETTIT
GAMBLED
AND
LOST
NOW
HELL
HAVE
TO
PAY
MORE
