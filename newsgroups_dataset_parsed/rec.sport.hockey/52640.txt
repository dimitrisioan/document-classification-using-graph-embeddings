i
hope
in

future
americans
are
thought
of
as
a
warlike
vicious
people
because
then
i
bet
a
lot
of
high
schools
would
pick
americans
as
their
mascot
jack
handey
please
have
a
care
with
phil
we
liked
him
a
lot
in
pittsburgh
he
didnt
score
a
lot
if
you
look
at
his
stats
last
year
but
he
worked
his
butt
off
it
was
his
speed
that
created
opportunities
in
the
offensive
zone
that
allowed
the
pens
to
utilize
his
potential
i
havent
been
paying
attention
to
him
this
year
so
i
cant
say
i
know
what
youre
objecting
to
he
has
been
out
with
injuries
though
hasnt
he
and
if
the
offense
isnt
there
theres
not
much
his
speed
will
do
for
you
like
i
said
he
created
opportunities
but
he
didnt
score
much
i
thought
the
money
offered
from
the
rangers
was
a
little
high
and
so
did
the
pens
i
guess
