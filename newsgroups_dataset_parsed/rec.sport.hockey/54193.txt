CUT
VUKOTA
AND
PILON
I
HAVE
BEEN
TO
ALL
ISLESCAPS
TILTS
AT
THE
CRAP
CENTRE
THIS
YEAR
ALL
ISLES
WINS
AND
THERE
IS
NO
JUSTIFICATION
FOR
VUKOTA
AND
PILON
TO
PLAY
FOR
THE
ISLES
VUKOTA
IS
ABSOLUTELY
THE
WORST
PUCK
HANDLER
IN
THE
WORLD
HE
COULDNT
HIT
A
BULL
IN
THE
ASS
WITH
A
BANJO
AL
MUST
REMEMBER
A
FEW
YEARS
BACK
WHEN
MICK
SCORED
GOALS
IN
ONE
PERIOD
AGAINST
THE
CAPS
IN
A
ISLES
WIN
I
WAS
THERE
AND
WAS
ASTONISHED
AS
WAS
THE
REST
OF
THE
CROWD
WAKEUP
AL
YEARS
LATER
HES
GOTTEN
WORSE
HES
A
CHEAP
SHOT
ARTIST
AND
ALWAYS
ENDS
UP
GETTING
STUPIDSENSELESS
PENALTIES
I
THINK
HE
WOULD
MAKE
A
GOOD
POLICE
OFFICIER
AS
FOR
PILON
HE
CANT
CARRY
THE
PUCK
OUT
TO
CENTER
ICE
BY
HIMSELF
HE
EITHER
MAKES
A
BAD
PASS
RESULTING
IN
A
TURNOVER
OR
HE
ATTEMPTS
TO
BRING
THE
PUCK
TOWARDS
THE
NEUTRAL
ZONE
AND
SKATES
RIGHT
INTO
AN
OPPOSING
SKATER
HE
CANT
STAY
ON
HIS
SKATES
WITH
MOST
FORWARDS
OR
CENTERS
HE
EITHER
FALLS
DOWN
OR
COMMITTS
A
PENALTY
CALL
UP
SOMEBODY
FROM
CAPITAL
DISTRICT
AL
AS
FAR
AS
THE
PLAYOFFS
THE
ISLES
ARE
AS
DIFFICULT
TO
FIGURE
OUT
AS
THE
CAPS
TWO
GOOD
TEAMS
WITH
TALENT
BUT
SO
INCONSISTENT
THEY
SHOULD
MEET
IN
THE
FIRST
ROUND
THE
ISLES
SEEM
TO
PLAY
UP
TO
THE
LEVEL
OF
THEIR
COMPETITION
SO
THEY
SHOULD
PLAY
WELL
AGAINST
JERSEY
TONITE
ITLL
PROBABLY
BE
ANOTHER
TIGHT
GAME
AS
THE
LAST
GAMES
HVE
BEEN
FOR
THE
ISLES
I
WISH
WHEN
THE
GET
A
LEAD
THEY
COULD
CONTINUE
TO
POUR
IT
ON
INSTEAD
OF
SETTLING
BACK
INTO
A
DEFENSIVE
SHELL
AND
LETTING
THE
OPPOSITION
GET
BACK
IN
THE
GAME
AL
MUST
UNDERSTAND
HE
CANT
DO
WITH
THIS
TEAM
WHAT
HE
DID
WITH
THE
ISLES
MAYBE
AL
SHOULD
GOT
TO
WHERE
IS
