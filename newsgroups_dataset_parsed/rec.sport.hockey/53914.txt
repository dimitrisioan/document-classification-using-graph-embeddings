THIRD
PERIOD
STARTED
AS
THE
OTHER
PERIODS
SWEDES
HAVING
MOST
OF
THE
PRESSURE
BUT
THE
CANADIANS
ALWAYS
DANGEROUS
ONCE
THEY
WERE
CLOSE
TO
THE
SWEDE
GOAL
AT
CANADA
CREATED
SOME
GREAT
CHANCES
AND
ARTO
BLOMSTEN
WAS
FORCED
TO
COVER
THE
PUCK
IN
THE
SWEDE
GOAL
CREASE
SINCE
SODERSTROM
LOST
SIGHT
OF

CANT
COVER
THE
PUCK
IN

GEOFF

EXCELLENT
PENALTY
SHOT
TO
GIVE
CANADA
A
GO

CANADA
INCREASED
THE
LEAD
ON
A
VERY
SUSPECT
OFFSIDE
GARTNER
VOLLEYED
A
BOUNCING
PUCK
PAST
SODERSTROM
TO
MAKE
IT
THE
SWEDES
RAN
OUT
OF
GAS
THEN
AND
COULDNT
PRODUCE
AS
GOOD
SCORING
CHANCES
AS
THEY
HAD
FOR
PERIODS
THE
GOAL
CAME
WITH
ONLY
SECOND
LEFT
ROD
BRINDAMOUR
SCORING
ON
A
REBOUND
FROM
SODERSTROM
WHERE
THE
SWEDISH
DEFENSE
ALREADY
HAD
THEIR
MINDS
IN
THE
DRESSING
ROOM
A
VERY
GOOD
GAME
THE
BEST
IN
THE
WC
SO
FAR
WITH
BOTH
GOALIES
PLAYING
GREAT
SODERSTROM
BEST
PLAYER
IN
SWEDEN
BUT
RANFORD
EVEN
PLAYED
BETTER
THAN
SODERSTROM
THAT
TELLS
YOU
SOMETHING
ABOUT
RANFORD
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
GOALIE
IN
THE
WORLD
WERE
SOME
COMMENTS
AFTER
THE
GAME
CANADA
PLAYED
A
VERY
DISCIPLINED
DEFENSE
RANFORD
POINTED
OUT
THAT
IT
IS
EASY
TO
PLAY
