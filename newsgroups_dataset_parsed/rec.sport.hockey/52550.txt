SUPERSTARS
AND

WAS

SELANNE
WAS

DEAN
J
FALCIONE
POSTING
FROM
WRITES
I
WROTE
WHEN
THE
PENS
GOT
MARIO
GRANTED
THERE
WAS
BIG
PUBLICITY
ETC
ETC
AND
INTEREST
WAS
IMMEDIATELY
GENERATED
GRETZKY
DID
THE
SAME
THING
FOR
LA
HOWEVER
IMNSHO
NEITHER
TEAM
WOULD
HAVE
SEEN
A
MARKED
IMPROVEMENT
IN
ATTENDANCE
IF
THE
TEAM
RECORD
DID
NOT
IMPROVE
IN
THE
YEAR
BEFORE
LEMIEUX
CAME
PITTSBURGH
FINISHED
WITH
POINTS
FOLLOWING
HIS
ARRIVAL
THE
PENS
FINISHED
WITH
AND
POINTS
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
STANLEY
CUPS
THROWN
IN
IT
WAS
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
PENS
ATTENDANCE
WAS
NEAR
CAPACITY
OUT
OF
SELLOUTS
YET
THEY
HADNT
MADE
THE
PLAYOFFS
SINCE
HOW
DO
YOU
EXPLAIN
A
PLACE
TEAM
BREAKING
ATTENDANCE
RECORDS
WHEN
THEY
HAVENT
BEEN
TO
THE
PLAYOFFS
IN
YEARS
MARIO
LEMIEUX
IS
THE
EXPLANATION
IMHO
YOU
COULD
MAKE
A
CASE
THAT
THE
EXPECTATION
OF
AN
IMPROVING
TEAM
THAT
WOULD
MAKE
THE
PLAYOFFS
IS
THE
REASON
FUNNY
YOU
SHOULD
MENTION
ITTHIS
IS
EXACTLY
THE
CASE
I
WAS
GOING
TO
MAKE
BUT
I
THINK
THE
REASON
IS
LEMIEUX
HAD
A
POINT
SEASON
AND
WAS
THE
FIRST
NONGRETZKY
TO
WIN
THE
HART
AND
ROSS
SINCE
PEOPLE
TURNED
OUT
TO
WATCH
HIM
PLAY
I
WILL
GRANT
THAT
A
STAR
LIKE
MARIO
WILL
DRAW
FANS
EVEN
IF
THE
TEAM
SUCKS
BUT
THIS
IS
SHORT
TERM
ONLY
I
STILL
DO
NOT
THINK
THE
ATTENDANCE
INCREASE
WILL
LAST
UNLESS
THE
TEAM
IS
A
WINNINGCOMPETITIVEIMPROVINGBUTTKICKING
ONE
PITTSBURGH
WAS
STILL
GETTING
BETTER
SO
PEOPLE
CONTINUED
TO
SUPPORT
THEM
IF
THEY
SUDDENLY
DROPPED
TO
SAY
POINTS
YOUD
HAVE
KNEE
SURGERY
FOR
SOME
OF
THE
PEOPLE
JUMPING
OFF
THE
BANDWAGON
ALSO
THE
FOLLOWING
YEAR
THE
PENS
HAD
POINTS
NOT
OK
MY
NUMBERS
CAME
FROM
THE
NHL
GUIDE
AND
RECORD
BOOK
THEY
MADE
THE
TRANSACTION
TO
TRY
AND
BUILD
A
WINNER
AROUND
MARIO
THAT
IS
TRUE
BUT
THE
IMPROVEMENT
IN
ATTENDANCE
CAME
BEFORE
THEY
STARTED
DOING
THIS
COFFEY
LATE
IN
AND
BEFORE
THEY
EVEN
HAD
A
PLAYOFF
BOUND
TEAM
A
DOUBLING
OF
ATTENDANCE
OCCURED
IN
FROM
THE
PREVIOUS
YEAR
AN
INCREASE
FROM
POINTS
TO
POINTS
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
DO
THAT
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
MARIO
LEMIEUX
IS
WHAT
DID
IT
YOU
CAN
GIVE
THE
CREDIT
TO
MARIO
SINCE
HE
DESERVES
IT
BUT
MY
POINT
IS
THAT
IT
WASNT
MARIO
HIMSELF
BUT
IT
WAS
THE
EXPECTATION
OF
THINGS
TO
COME
IE
A
WINNING
TEAM
THAT
HE
CREATED
BY
BEING
THE
NEXT
GREAT
HOCKEY
SUPERSTAR
AND
BEFORE
ANYBODY
JUMPS
IN
AND
SAYS
IM
NITPICKING
AND
MINCING
WORDS
GO
BACK
AND
READ
FROM
WHERE
THIS
THREAD
STARTED
IT
MIGHT
HELP
TO
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
WOULD
GO
THROUGH
A
FANS
MIND
WHO
SUDDENLY
FOUND
AN
INTEREST
IN
MARIO
AND
THE
PENS
WAS
IT
GEE
MARIO
LEMIEUX
IS
AMAZING
ILL
GO
WATCH
HIM
PLAY
OR
WAS
IT
GEE
NOW
WEVE
GOT
A
KICK
ASS
GUY
ON
OUR
SIDE
ILL
GO
WATCH
HIM
PLAY
I
THINK
IT
WAS
THE
LATTER
SIMILAR
THING
HAPPENED
IN
LA
BEFORE
GRETZKYS
ARRIVAL
ABOUT
PER
GAME
AFTER
CONSTANT
SELLOUTS
THEY
ARE
STILL
SELLING
OUT
EVERY
GAME
DESPITE
SHOWING
LITTLE
OR
NO
IMPROVEMENT
SINCE
GRETZKYS
FIRST
YEAR
THERE
HOW
DO
YOU
EXPLAIN
IT
PEOPLE
ARE
GOING
TO
SEE
GRETZKY
THEY
CERTAINLY
ARENT
GOING
TO
SEE
A
WINNER
THEY
HAVENT
GOT
A
WINNER
THEYVE
HAD
MUCH
BETTER
TEAMS
IN
THEIR
PAST
HISTORY
THAN
THEY
CURRENTLY
HAVE
YET
THEY
DIDNT
DRAW
AS
WELL
THEN
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
ACCURATE
THE
TICKETS
SELL
BUT
PEOPLE
DONT
GO
TO
THE
GAMES
I
THINK
THIS
THREAD
HAS
ALREADY
BEEN
DISCUSSEDSEASON
TICKET
HOLDERS
IN
LA
DONT
ALWAYS
USE
THEIR
TICKETS
SO
IN
EFFECT
AFTER
THE
KINGS
INITIAL
SUCCESS
FOLLOWING
GRETZKYS
ARRIVAL
TO
POINTS
SAME
SOURCE
AND
CORRESPONDING
ATTENDANCE
JUMP
THERE
HAS
BEEN
AN
EFFECTIVE
DROP
IN
ATTENDANCE
EVEN
THOUGH
TICKET
SALES
MAY
NOT
HAVE
CHANGED
MUCH
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
KINGS
ARE
A
WINNER
IS
DEBATABLE
I
CLAIM
THAT
SINCE
GRETZKYS
ARRIVAL
THEY
HAVE
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
BEEN
COMPETITIVEI
ALSO
CLAIM
THAT
MCNALL
HAS
MADE
A
STUPID
MOVE
IN
TRYING
TO
REASSEMBLE
THE
OILER
DYNASTYBUT
THATS
ANOTHER
STORY
AND
INCLUDED
ONLY
BECAUSE
I
DONT
LIKE
MCNALL
ANYWAY
MCNALL
DID
DO
SOME
HEAVY
MARKETING
AROUND
GRETZKY
AND
THAT
UNDOUBTEDLY
WAS
ALSO
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
ATTENDANCE
AND
MERCHANDISING
SALES
ETC
BUT
AS
I
SAID
WHEN
THE
KINGS
HAVE
BEEN
IN
THERE
LITTLE
TAILSPINS
OVER
THE
PAST
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
EMPTY
SEATS
AT
THE
FORUM
EVEN
IF
THE
TICKETS
WERE
SOLD
I
THINK
IN
THE
CASE
OF
A
LEMIEUX
OR
GRETZKY
THE
PLAYER
CAN
TRANSCEND
WINNING
AS
THE
MAJOR
DRAWING
POWER
FOR
THE
SHORT
TERM
IMO
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
INEVITABLE
THAT
THE
TEAM
WILL
IMPROVE
WITH
A
PLAYER
SUCH
AS
LEMIEUX
OR
GRETZKY
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THEY
MAKE
PEOPLE
AROUND
THEM
BETTER
BUT
WINNING
SURE
AS
HELL
HELPS
WELL
AT
LEAST
WE
ARE
IN
FULL
AGREEMENT
HERE
THIS
DOES
NOT
MAKE
ROGERS
POINT
ANY
MORE
VALID
BUT
THE
JETS
ARENT
SO
ARE
YOU
SAYING
ROGER
HAS
EVER
HAD
A
VALID
POINT
COULDNT
RESIST
GETTING
A
HUGE
JUMP
IN
PRODUCTIVITY
YET
THEY
ARE
GETTING
A
HUGE
JUMP
IN
ATTENDANCE
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
THE
EMERGENCE
OF
TEEMU
SELANNE
THEY
HAVE
THE
BEST
RECORD
IN
HOCKEY
IT
SURE
AS
HELL
ISNT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
WINNING
YES
BUT
THEY
ARE
DOING
NO
WORSE
THAN
LAST
YEAR
I
THINK
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
REASONING
I
APPLIED
TO
A
NEW
PITTSBURGH
FAN
APPLIES
TO
ALL
THE
EXTRA
PEOPLE
SHOWING
UP
AT
WINNIPEG
GAMES
ITS
DIFFICULT
TO
PREDICT
BUT
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
IF
THE
JETS
MISS
THE
PLAYOFFS
NEXT
SEASON
THAT
IN
THE
YEAR
AFTER
THEY
WILL
MAINTAIN
THEIR
ATTENDANCE
LEVELS
I
SERIOUSLY
DOUBT
IT
BECAUSE
IN
THAT
CASE
THE
EXPECTATION
OF
AN
IMPROVING
TEAM
WOULD
BE
GONE
WITH
OR
WITHOUT
SELANNE
I
DID
PROVIDE
THE
EXAMPLE
OF
ROCKET
ISMAIL
AND
THE
TORONTO
ARGONAUTS
OF
THE
CFLDID
YOU
LEAVE
IT
OUT
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
THE
CFL
IF
THATS
THE
CASE
THEN
FAIR
ENOUGH
BUT
IF
IT
ISNT
THE
CASE
THEN
IM
CURIOUS
TO
HEAR
YOUR
EXPLANATION
