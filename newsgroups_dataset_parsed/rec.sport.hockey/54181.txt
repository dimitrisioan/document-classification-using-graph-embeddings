tapestry
writes
way
back
in
the
early
years
it
took
wins
to
garner
the
stanley
cup
soooooo
a
couple
of
local
fish
mongers
local
to
the
joe
louis
arena
that
is
started
the
tradition
of
throwing
an
octopi
onto
the
ice
with
every
win
after
each
victory
one
leg
would
be
severed
before
the
octopus
found
its
way
to
the
ice
they
are
dead
by
the
way
it
was
a
brilliant
marketing
strategy
to
shore
up
the
demand
for
one
of
their
least
popular
products
hope
this
helps
j
lange
local
to
the
joe
louis
arena
you
mean
local
to
olympia
stadium
where
red
wings
games
were
played
until
fairly
recently
early
comes
to
mind
as
far
as
i
know
the
rest
of
the
post
is
basically
correct
if
what
you
meant
by
local
was
simply
detroit
and
im
being
incredibly
picky
okay
sorry
