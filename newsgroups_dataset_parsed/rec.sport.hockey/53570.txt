WRITES
ABOUT
OR
WEEKS
AGO
I
READ
IN
THE
TORONTO
SUN
A
QUOTE
FROM
ALEX
IT
WENT
SOMETHING
LIKE
SARCASTICALLY
YEP
PATTYS
THE
MAN
HES
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
TEAMS
SUCCESSIM
A
NOBODY
AROUND
HERE
HOW
CAN
YOU
ASSUME
IT
WAS
A
SARCASTIC
REMARK
FOR
SOMEONE
WHOSE
FIRST
LANGUAGE
IS
NOT
ENGLISH
I
WOULD
INTERPRET
THAT
COMMENT
TO
MEAN
THAT
HE
BELIEVES
PAT
IS
THE
MVP
ON
THE
TEAM
AND
THAT
HE
IS
JUST
ONE
OF
THE
OTHER
NORMAL
PLAYERS
QUITE
MODEST
I
MIGHT
SAY
WELL
I
DONT
RECALL
ASSUMING
ANYTHING
EXCEPT
PERHAPS
THAT
THE
COLUMNIST
WHO
REPORTED
THE
INCIDENT
WAS
TELLING
THE
TRUTH
IE
THE
SARCASTIC
IMPRESSION
CAME
FROM
HIM

TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
ALEX
HAS
A
PRETTY
FAIR
GRASP
OF
THE
ENGLISH
LANGUAGEAND
HIS
RECENT
COMMENT
AFTER
THE
DETROIT
GAME
WOULD
INDICATE
THAT
THIS
REMARK
IS
WHAT
I
THINK
IT
TO
BE
