RE
PLUS
MINUS
STAT
IN
ARTICLE
JOSEPH
R
MCDONALD
WRITES
JAGR
HAS
A
HIGHER
BUT
FRANCIS
HAS
HAD
MORE
POINTS
AND
TAKE
IT
FROM
AN
INFORMED
OBSERVER
RONNIE
FRANCIS
HAS
HAD
A
MUCH
BETTER
SEASON
THAN
JAROMIR
JAGR
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
TAKE
ANYTHING
AWAY
FROM
JARO
WHO
HAD
A
DECENT
YEAR
ALTHOUGH
IT
DIDNT
LIVE
UP
TO
THE
EXPECTATIONS
OF
SOME
BOWMAN
TENDED
TO
OVERPLAY
FRANCIS
AT
TIMES
BECAUSE
HE
IS
A
BOWMANSTYLE
PLAYER
HE
PLAYS
HARD
AT
ALL
TIMES
DOESNT
DISREGARD
HIS
DEFENSIVE
RESPONSIBILITIES
AND
IS
A
GOOD
LEADER
BOWMAN
REWARDED
HIM
BE
INCREASING
HIS
ICE
TIME
JAGR
CAN
BE
VERY
ARROGANT
AND
JUVENILE
AND
DISPLAY
A
ME
FIRST
ATTITUDE
THIS
RUBBED
BOWMAN
THE
WRONG
WAY
AND
CAUSED
HIM
TO
LOSE
SOME
ICE
TIME
THROUGHOUT
THE
YEAR
FRANCIS
CONSISTENTLY
RECIEVED
MORE
ICE
TIME
THAN
JAGR
ALTHOUHG
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
STATS
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
I
AM
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
JAGR
HAD
MORE
POINTS
PER
MINUTE
PLAYED
THAT
FRANCIS
WHEN
YOU
ADD
TO
THAT
JAGRS
BETTER
RATING
I
THINK
IT
BECOMES
EVIDENT
THAT
JAGR
HAD
A
BETTER
SEASON
NOT
THAT
FRANCIS
HAD
A
BAD
