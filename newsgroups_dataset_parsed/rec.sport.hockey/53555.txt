GREG
BALLENTINE
WRITES
YOU
HAVE
COMPLETELY
MISSED
THE
POINT
WITH
THE
SELKE
TROPHY
IT
GOES
TO
THE
BEST
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
THIS
IS
THE
FORWARD
WHO
FORGOES
POINTS
TO
HELP
HIS
TEAM
OUT
DEFENSIVELY
IT
IS
AN
UNSUNG
HERO
OF
SORTS
YES
LEMIEUX
AND
GILMOUR
ARE
GOOD
DEFENSIVE
PLAYERS
BUT
THEY
PLAY
A
MORE
OFFENSIVELY
ORIENTED
STYLE
THAN
A
TRUE
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
THIS
YEAR
YOU
MEAN
GUYS
THAT
CHECK
BUT
CANT
SCORE
THE
GUYS
WHO
CAN
BOTH
CHECK
AND
SCORE
SHOULDNT
BE
CANDIDATES
IS
THAT
RIGHT
THE
SELKE
CANDIDATE
FORWARDS
MAIN
PURPOSE
ON
A
SHIFT
IS
TO
PREVENT
GOALS
FROM
BEING
SCORED
NOT
TO
SCORE
THEM
WHEN
LEMIEUX
OR
GILMOUR
PLAY
THEIR
NUMBER
ONE
PURPOSE
IS
TO
SCORE
DEFENCE
IS
SECONDARY
ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING
THE
LINE
THAT
PLAYS
AGAINST
THEM
IS
PROBABLY
A
DEFENSIVE
ONE
THAT
IS
WHY
THEY
ARE
NOT
SELKE
CANDIDATES
WHEN
TARASOV
CALLED
BOB
GAINEY
THE
BEST
PLAYER
IN
THE
WORLD
IT
WAS
ASSUMED
THAT
HE
MEANED
THE
BEST
TECHNICAL
PLAYER
THE
ONE
WHO
KNEW
EVERY
INTRICACY
ABOUT
PLAYING
HOCKEY
AND
NEVER
MADE
A
TECHNICAL
ERROR
AND
WHO
WAS
IT
THAT
MADE
THIS
ASSUMPTION
ALL
OF
YOUR
FRIENDS
MAYBE
SORRY
GREG
BUT
PEOPLE
ARENT
ENOUGHYOU
CAN
ASSUME
ALL
THAT
YOU
WANT
TO
BUT
IF
YOU
THINK
TARASOV
WAS
SERIOUS
THEN
YOU
ARE
AN
IDIOT
SOMEONE
POSTED
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THIS
ASSUMPTION
BEING
LOST
IN
TRANSLATION
IT
WAS
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
WHOEVER
THIS
WAS
PLEASE
REPOST
IT
I
AGREE
WITH
THIS
ASSESSMENT
BOB
GAINEY
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
BEST
TECHNICAL
PLAYER
EVER
RIGHT
GREG
DID
YOU
SEE
THIS
IN
THE
SUN
OR
SOMETHING
WHAT
DID
YOU
THINK
OF
CLAUDE
PROVOST
GAINEY
WAS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
A
JOURNEYMAN
PLAYER
WHOS
OUTSTANDING
ABILITIES
WERE
ENTIRELY
POLITICAL
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
HAD
A
COL
LECTION
OF
DEFENSIVE
SKILLS
BUT
HE
HAD
ABSOLUTELY
NO
OFFENSIVE
SKILLS
AT
ALL
NONE
BUT
PERHAPS
YOU
THINK
THAT
THE
ABILITIES
TO
PASS
THE
PUCK
SHOOT
THE
PUCK
AND
DEKE
A
GOALIE
OR
DEFENSEMAN
ARE
NOT
TECHNICAL
SKILLS
GAINEY
IS
THE
BEST
DEFENSIVE
FORWARD
EVER
I
STAND
BY
THAT
ASSESSMENT
HE
WAS
A
VERY
GOOD
PLAYER
WHO
BELONGS
IN
THE
HALL
OF
FAME
DID
YOU
EVER
WATCH
HIM
PLAY
HE
NEVER
MADE
A
TECHNICAL
ERROR
BABBLING
DELETED
GEE
GREG
THE
PUNDITS
WERE
CALLING
GILMOUR
THE
BEST
TWOWAY
PLAYER
IN
THE
LEAGUE
WAY
BACK
WHEN
HE
WAS
WITH
ST
LOUIS
I
WOULD
HAVE
EXPECTED
YOU
TO
HAVE
PICKED
UP
ON
THAT
WHO
ARE
THESE
PUNDITS
GILMOUR
WAS
GOOD
WITH
ST
LOUIS
BUT
HE
WAS
NOT
THE
BEST
TWOWAY
PLAYER
IN
THE
GAME
WHEN
HE
WAS
WITH
THEM
YOU
HAVE
OVERHYPED
GILMOUR
ON
THIS
NET
FOR
MONTHS
HE
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
FORWARD
BUT
HARDLY
THE
BEST
IN
THE
NHL
