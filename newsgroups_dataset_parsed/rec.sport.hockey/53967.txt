youll
have
a
hard
time
selling
any
sport
to
a
community
that
cant
play
it
on
account
of
availability
or
financial
reasons
hockey
is
pretty
much
a
sport
for
the
white
and
well
off
what
white
yes

definitely
not
hockey
season

owners
have
the

any
of
the
four

american
sports
do
you
have
a
basis
for
this
claim
try
these
stats
taken
from
playboy
magazine
june
percentage

fans

fans
who
make
more
than
percentage
of
pro

fans
who
make
more
than
and
think
of
where
the
majority
of
hockey
players
come
from
from
a
farm
out
in
boondock
saskatchewan
or
weedville
alberta
the
biggest
advantage
that
kids
from
boondock
or
weedville
have
is
the
availability
of
ice
in
the
san
jose
area
we
have
a
population
of
and
that
population
is
served
by
ice
arenas
in
contrast
kamloops
british
columbia
has
a
population
of
about
and
has
rinks
there
are
also
myriad
ponds
pools
etc
that
freeze
in
the
winter
down
here
its
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a
bicycle
up
there
its
hard
to
find
a
kid
without
a
pair
of
skates
and
before
you
say
what
does
he
know
hes
from
california
let
me
say
that
i
was
born
and
raised
in
trail
british
columbia
a
town
of
about
with
lots
of
ice
in
the
winter
my
father
did
radio
play
by
play
for
the
local
team
the
trail
smokeaters
who
by
the
way
were
the
last
canadian
team
to
win
the
world
championship
back
in
i
was
on
skates
almost
as
soon
as
i
could
walk
and
have
been
playing
recreational
hockey
for
about
years
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
a
hockey
league
in
the
inner
city
the
insurance
alone
is
a
big
enough
barrier
the
inner
city
isnt
the
only
place
that
is
poor
i
think
the
biggest
barrier
to
hockey
in
the
inner
city
is
no
ice
to
play
on
lack
of
ice
is
a
big
factor
but
costs
is
a
bigger
factor
both
my
kids
play
for
the
santa
clara
valley
hockey
association
and
this
season
which
just
ended
cost
me
per
kid
for
membership
in
hockey
usa
plus
per
kid
for
club
dues
the
hockey
usa
fees
cover
excess
medical
insurance
and
the
club
dues
cover
ice
time
officials
trophies
etc
other
areas
have
similar
fees
unless
the
city
government
subsidises
some
of
the
costs
as
stockton
does
by
the
way
most
ice
arenas
are
located
in
what
could
be
called
the
inner
city
areas
eastridge
and
vallco
are
exceptions
redwood
citys
rink
is
in
an
industrial
area
on
bay
rd
near
berkeleys
is
near
ashby
and
martin
luther
king
stocktons
is
in
oak
park
sacramentos
is
in
an
older
section
of
downtown
i
forget
the
name
of
the
street
fresnos
is
out
on
the
edge
of
town
just
west
of
santa
rosas
is
a
nice
rink
but
its
in
an
older
section
of
town
dublins
is
outside
of
town
off
most
of
the
rinks
are
old
and
expensive
to
run
with
huge
electric
bills
and
insurance
premiums
if
you
want
to
buy
ice
time
expect
to
pay
around
per
hour
at
any
of
these
rinks
some
of
them
give
you
a
minute
hour
for
your
money
others
give
you
a
minute
hour
and
include
the
resurfacing
time
in
the
fee
