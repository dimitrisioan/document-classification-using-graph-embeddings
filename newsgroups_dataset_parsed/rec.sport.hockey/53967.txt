PLAYERS
COME
FROM
FROM
A

OUT
IN
BOONDOCK
SASKATCHEWAN
OR
WEEDVILLE
ALBERTA
THE
BIGGEST
ADVANTAGE
THAT
KIDS
FROM
BOONDOCK
OR
WEEDVILLE
HAVE
IS
THE
AVAILABILITY
OF
ICE
IN
THE
SAN
JOSE
AREA
WE
HAVE
A
POPULATION
OF
AND
THAT
POPULATION
IS
SERVED
BY
ICE
ARENAS
IN
CONTRAST
KAMLOOPS
BRITISH
COLUMBIA
HAS
A
POPULATION
OF
ABOUT
AND
HAS
RINKS
THERE
ARE
ALSO
MYRIAD
PONDS
POOLS
ETC
THAT
FREEZE
IN
THE
WINTER
DOWN
HERE
ITS
HARD
TO
FIND
A
KID
WITHOUT
A
BICYCLE
UP
THERE
ITS
HARD
TO
FIND
A
KID
WITHOUT
A
PAIR
OF
SKATES
AND
BEFORE
YOU
SAY
WHAT
DOES
HE
KNOW
HES
FROM
CALIFORNIA
LET
ME
SAY
THAT
I
WAS
BORN
AND
RAISED
IN
TRAIL
BRITISH
COLUMBIA
A
TOWN
OF
ABOUT
WITH
LOTS
OF
ICE
IN
THE
WINTER
MY
FATHER
DID
RADIO
PLAY
BY
PLAY
FOR
THE
LOCAL
TEAM
THE
TRAIL
SMOKEATERS
WHO
BY
THE
WAY
WERE
THE
LAST
CANADIAN
TEAM
TO
WIN
THE
WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIP
BACK
IN
I
WAS
ON
SKATES
ALMOST
AS
SOON
AS
I
COULD
WALK
AND
HAVE
BEEN
PLAYING
RECREATIONAL
HOCKEY
FOR
ABOUT
YEARS
WHEN
WAS
THE
LAST
TIME
YOU
SAW
A
HOCKEY
LEAGUE
IN
THE
INNER
CITY
THE
INSURANCE
ALONE
IS
A
BIG
ENOUGH
BARRIER
THE
INNER
CITY
ISNT
THE
ONLY
PLACE
THAT
IS
POOR
I
THINK
THE
BIGGEST
BARRIER
TO
HOCKEY
IN
THE
INNER
CITY
IS
NO
ICE
TO
PLAY
ON
LACK
OF
ICE
IS
A
BIG
FACTOR
BUT
COSTS
IS
A
BIGGER
FACTOR
BOTH
MY
KIDS
PLAY
FOR
THE
SANTA
CLARA
VALLEY
HOCKEY
ASSOCIATION
AND
THIS
SEASON
WHICH
JUST
ENDED
COST
ME

UNLESS
THE
CITY
GOVERNMENT
SUBSIDISES
SOME
OF
THE
COSTS
AS
STOCKTON
DOES
BY
THE
WAY
MOST
ICE

LOCATED
IN
WHAT
COULD
BE
CALLED
THE
