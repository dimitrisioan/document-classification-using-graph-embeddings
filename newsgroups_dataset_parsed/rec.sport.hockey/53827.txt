GREG
BALLENTINE
WRITES
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
FINE
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
MURRAY
WAS
A
BAD
GM
I
MERELY
SAID
THAT
HE
ISNT
THE
BEST
GM
IN
HOCKEY
OR
EVEN
A
CONTENDER
FOR
THAT
HONOR
IF
MURRAY
IS
AS
GREAT
AS
YOU
CLAIM
THE
WINGS
WOULD
HAVE
WON
THE
STANLEY
CUP
BY
NOW
PROBABLY
MORE
THAN
ONCE
IF
HE
WAS
AS
GREAT
A
GM
AS
YOU
CLAIM
I
THINK
YOU
MISSED
ONE
OF
MY
POINTS
THERE
IT
TAKES
MORE
THAN
A
GREAT
GM
TO
WIN
A
STANLEY
CUP
EVEN
ONCE
SOME
OF
THE
GUYS
ON
THE
LIST
YOU
GAVE
EARLIER
NEVER
WON
ONE
I
AGREE
THAT
YOU
AND
I
COULD
PROBABLY
ARGUE
BACK
AND
FORTH
FOR
DAYS
TO
NO
AVAIL
ABOUT
WHO
IS
THE
BEST
GM
IN
HOCKEY
THAT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
OPINION
AND
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
MY
OPINION
IS
ANY
BETTER
THAN
YOURS
OR
YOURS
THAN
MINE
BUT
THE
POINT
OF
MY
ORIGINAL
ORIGINAL
POST
IF
NOT
WELL
STATED
WAS
THAT
MURRAY
HAS
THE
GM
ABILITIES
BUT
NOT
THE
COACHING
ABILITIES
WHICH
LEADS
TO
BELOW
AND
HE
WAS
AS
POOR
A
COACH
AS
YOU
CLAIM
HE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
INTELLIGENT
ENOUGH
TO
HIRE
THE
COACH
TO
PUSH
THE
TEAM
TO
THE
NEXT
LEVEL
OF
SUCCESS
I
THINK
AT
THIS
POINT
THERES
A
PERSONAL
EMOTIONAL
ELEMENT
INVOLVED
HERE
WHICH
TRANSCENDS
MURRAYS
LOGICAL
THOUGHT
AS
OUTSIDERS
ITS
FINE
FOR
US
TO
SAY
HE
SHOULD
HIRE
A
DIFFERENT
COACH
IN
FACT
HE
HAS
TALKED
ABOUT
DOING
SO
IN
THE
PAST
BUT
THE
PRESS
HERE
IN
DETROIT
AT
LEAST
HAS
SO
BUILT
UP
THIS
BUSINESS
ABOUT
MURRAY
NEVER
GETTING
PAST
THE
SECOND
ROUND
OF
THE
PLAYOFFS
AS
A
COACH
THAT
I
THINK
HE
HAS
TAKEN
IT
UPON
HIMSELF
TO
PROVE
TO
THE
WORLD
THAT
HE
IS
CAPABLE
OF
COACHING
A
TEAM
PAST
THE
SECOND
ROUND
HE
NEEDS
TO
AS
THE
PAPERS
SAY
GET
THAT
MONKEY
OFF
HIS
BACK
SO
IT
BECOMES
A
MATTER
NOT
OF
INTELLIGENCE
BUT
OF
PRIDE
IS
IT
FOOLISH
TO
LET
PRIDE
STAND
IN
THE
WAY
OF
SOUND
LOGIC
PERHAPS
BUT
WERE
ALL
A
LITTLE
THAT
WAY
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
I
THINK
EVENTUALLY
HELL
STEP
DOWN
FROM
BEHIND
THE
BENCH
AND
CONCENTRATE
ON
HIS
GM
DUTIES
AND
THE
TEAM
WILL
IMPROVE
AS
A
RESULT
I
THINK
HIS
COACHING
DUTIES
TAKE
AWAY
TIME
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
OTHERWISE
SPENT
ON
GM
WORK
IN
THAT
SENSE
ONCE
HE
STEPS
DOWN
AS
COACH
WELL
SEE
HOW
GOOD
OF
A
GM
HE
REALLY
IS
BUT
MURRAY
IS
AN
AVERAGE
UNSPECTACULAR
NHL
COACH
AND
A
PRETTY
GOOD
GM
SO
NONE
OF
THIS
IS
TRUE
ANYWAY
I
MAY
NOT
AGREE
WITH
EVERYTHING
YOUVE
SAID
BUT
ITS
BEEN
FUN
DISCUSSING
IT
WITH
YOU
