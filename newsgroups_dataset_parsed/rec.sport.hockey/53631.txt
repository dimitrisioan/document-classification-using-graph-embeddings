RE
NHL
TEAM
IN
MILWAUKEE
WELL
PUT
JASON
I
AM
NOT
FROM
WISCONSIN
BUT
I
HAVE
CLOSE
RELATIVES
WHO
LIVE
IN
PORT
WASHINGTON
ABOUT
MINUTES
NORTH
OF
MILWAUKEE
I
VISIT
THE
CITY
REGULARLY
AND
I
HAVE
BEEN
IN
THE
BRADLEY
FOUR
TIMES
TO
SEE
THE
ADMIRALS
PLAY
AND
THE
NCAA
HOCKEY
CHAMPIONSHIPS
IT
IS
A
BEAUTIFUL
BUILDING
THE
PETTITS
AND
THE
CITY
LIKE
TO
PROMOTE
IT
AS
THE
BEST
FACILITY
FOR
HOCKEY
IN
NORTH
AMERICA
AS
TO
WHAT
WILL
HAPPEN
WITH
THE
ADMIRALS
IF
MILWAUKEE
DOES
ACQUIRE
A
FRANCHISE
WORD
IS
THE
TEAM
WILL
MOVE
TO
GREEN
BAY
AND
PLAY
IN
THE
BROWN
COUNTY
ARENA
ONCE
AGAIN
THE
ADMIRALS
ARE
AN
INDEPENDENT
FRANCHISE
AND
THE
PEOPLE
OF
MILWAUKEE
HAVE
BEEN
SUPPORTING
THEM
WELL
THE
GAMES
I
HAVE
BEEN
TO
HAVE
SEEN
CROWDS
ANYWHERE
FROM
TO
WHICH
ARE
NUMBERS
SOME
NHL
TEAMS
IE
THE
ISLANDERS
HARTFORD
NEW
JERSEY
WOULD
BE
ENVIOUS
OF
HAVING
ON
SOME
NIGHTS
PLUS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CITY
IS
ABLE
TO
SUPPORT
A
MINOR
LEAGUE
FRANCHISE
WITHOUT
THE
GLAMOUR
OF
HAVING
AN
NHL
CLUB
AFFILIATED
TO
IT
IS
TESTIMONY
TO
THE
AMOUNT
OF
HOCKEY
INTEREST
EXISTS
IN
THE
CITY
