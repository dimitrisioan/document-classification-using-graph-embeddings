REPLY
TO
AN
ARTICLE
BY
GRAHAM
HUDSON
YOU
DONT
THINK
HE
IS
PERFORMING
UNDER
PRESSURE
NOW
THE
MAJOR
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
PLAYOFF
HOCKEY
AND
NORMAL
HOCKEY
IS
PLAY
ING
EVERY
OTHER
NIGHT
WHICH
IS
PHYSICALLY
EXHAUSTING
AND
YOU
PLAY
THE
SAME
TEAM
IN
A
CONSECUTIVE
STRING
OF
GAMES
IS
THIS
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
PRESSURE
HAVE
YOU
EVEN
THOUGHT
ABOUT
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
PRESSURE
OR
ARE
YOUR
THOUGHTS
LIKE
MOST
OF
THE
REST
OF
THIS
DRIVEL
SIMPLY
HALFBAKED
THIS
WAS
FOR
ANYBODY
WHO
WOULD
LIKE
TO
CHECK
HE
WENT
ON
IN
ANOTHER
ARTICLE
TO
SAY
PARAPHRASED
PLAYOFF
HOCKEY
IS
JUST
AN
EXPRESSION
USED
BY
ANNOUNCERS
TO
CONVINCE
SIMPLEMINDED
FOLKS
LIKE
YOURSELF
THAT
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SEEING
IS
A
BETTER
PRODUCT
THAN
A
REGULARSEASON
GAME
NOW
HOWEVER
IN
ARTICLE
ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
WITH
A
WIN
OVER
A
TOUGH
WHALER
SQUAD
THE
LEAFS
SHOWED
ALL
DOUBTERS
WHAT
PLAYOFF
HOCKEY
IS
ALL
ABOUT
SO
ROGER
WHAT
EXACTLY
IS
PLAYOFF
HOCKEY
ALL
ABOUT
OR
IS
IT
A
CONVENIENT
PHRASE
TO
USE
IN
CERTAIN
CIRCUMSTANCES
ONLY
YOU
SEE
WHEN
YOU
SPOUT
OFF
WITH
FLAME
BAIT
TOO
MANY
TIMES
SOONER
OR
LATER
IT
CATCHES
UP
WITH
YOU
NICE
TRY
DEEPAK
BUT
TOUGH
WHALER
SQUAD
SHOULD
HAVE
CLUED
YOU
IN
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
MY
LEAF
WOOFING
WAS
TONGUEINCHEEK
IF
PLAYOFF
HOCKEY
IS
ANY
MORE
INTENSE
THAN
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
VARIETY
THEN
IT
IS
BECAUSE
THE
TEAMS
ARE
FACING
EACH
OTHER
AT
LEAST
CONSECUTIVE
TIMES
IN
DAYS
AND
HOCKEY
BEING
THE
CONTACT
SPORT
THAT
IT
IS
SOME
THINGS
WILL
BE
CARRIED
OVER
THAT
MIGHT
DISSIPATE
DURING
THE
REGULAR
SEASON
BUT
THAT
IS
ONLY
FOR
SOME
OF
THE
PLAYERS
MANY
OF
THE
REST
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
PLAYING
WITH
INJURIES
WHO
MISS
THEIR
FAMILIES
OR
WHO
LIKE
GRANT
FUHR
WOULD
REALLY
RATHER
BE
PLAYING
GOLF
DONT
REALLY
GIVE
A
DAMN
OF
COURSE
I
CANT
SAY
THIS
FOR
SURE
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
FAIRLY
TYPICAL
OF
HUMAN
NATURE
AND
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
HOCKEY
PLAYERS
ARE
ABOVE
HAVING
WHAT
I
CONSIDER
TYPICALLY
HUMAN
ATTITUDES
WITH
THE
RECENT
SALARY
ESCALATIONS
THE
KEY
PLAYERS
ARE
ACTUALLY
LOSING
MONEY
BY
PARTICIPATING
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
THE
ONES
WHO
REGARD
THE
PLAYOFF
TAKE
AS
SOME
KIND
OF
A
BONANZA
ARE
FRINGE
PLAYERS
WHO
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
CONSISTENTLY
BE
A
FORCE
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
NOW
I
KNOW
SOME
OF
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
COME
BACK
WITH
WINNING
SPIRIT
AND
ALL
OF
THAT
CRAP
BUT
THESE
PLAYERS
ARE
PROFESSIONALS
AFTER
ALL
WHILE
THEY
MAY
LOVE
TO
PLAY
THE
GAME
THAT
LOVE
IS
ENTIRELY
INCIDENTAL
TO
THEIR
PURPOSE
WHICH
IS
TO
MAKE
A
DECENT
LIVING
OF
COURSE
THE
COACH
IS
A
PROFESSIONAL
AS
WELL
AND
PART
OF
WHAT
HE
IS
BEING
PAID
TO
DO
IS
MOTIVATE
THE
PLAYERS
SO
IF
THE
COACH
DOES
HIS
JOB
WELL
ENOUGH
THE
PLAYERS
MAY
RESPOND
WITH
A
WINNING
EFFORT
THE
SECOND
SEASON
IS
AFTER
ALL
MERELY
AN
EXHIBITION
THE
TRUE
CHAMPIONS
OF
THE
LEAGUE
ARE
THE
DIVISION
WINNERS
THE
TEAMS
THAT
COME
OUT
ON
TOP
AFTER
THE
LONG
STRUGGLE
OF
THE
SEASON
THE
STANLEY
CUP
PLAYOFFS
MERELY
ACCORD
VICTORY
TO
THE
TEAM
THAT
HAS
REMAINED
HEALTHY
AND
HOT
THE
EMPHASIS
ON
THE
PLAYOFFS
WITH
THEIR
SUDDEN
DEATH
APPEAL
HAS
BEEN
PROMOTED
BY
THE
MEDIA
AND
THE
OWNERS
WITH
PROFIT
PURELY
IN
MIND
EVEN
IF
PITTSBURGH
LOSES
THE
PLAYOFFS
WE
ALL
KNOW
THAT
THEY
WERE
REALLY
THE
BEST
TEAM
IN
THE
LEAGUE
OVER
THE
YEAR
THEY
PROVED
IT
CORDIALLY
AS
ALWAYS
