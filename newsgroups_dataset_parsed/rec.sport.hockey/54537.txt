thats
not
inner
calm
its
boredom
and
its
being
spoiled
the
arenas
been
as
quiet
as
a
church
on
many
nights
this
year
too
many
of
us
just
take
winning
for
granted
its
been
seemingly
forever
since
the
team
lost
and
weve
forgotten
what
its
like
to
feel
real
excitement
and
surprise
at
victory
i
dont
really
agree
with
this
but
it
is
an
entirely
different
high
at
any
rate
the
first
cup
the
pens
won
i
didnt
think
about
anything
else
i
just
watched
mario
and
all
skate
the
thing
around
the
ice
now
it
seems
to
be
more
of
a
question
whether
or
not
thirty
years
from
now
young
hockey
fans
may
there
be
millions
will
still
ask
us
what
it
was
like
to
watch
this
team
thats
what
they
are
playing
for
now
but
i
was
still
as
nervous
as
ever
when
the
devils
were
blasting
shots
at
barrasso
in
the
final
seconds
of
game
three
so
the
fun
is
far
from
over
yet
im
not
bored
either
most
people
i
know
say
that
winning
the
second
cup
was
better
than
the
first
but
to
me
nothing
will
ever
top
that
first
one
but
im
every
bit
as
excited
this
year
and
i
am
experiencing
that
inner
calm
to
which
susan
originally
referred
inner
calm
is
not
boredom
as
far
as
the
arena
in
general
being
boring
well
richards
got
that
right
its
been
that
way
all
season
i
attribute
it
to
a
lot
of
new
fans
who
just
dont
have
the
same
spirit
and
knowledge
as
longtime
fans
at
last
tuesdays
game
i
overheard
a
man
express
surprise
that
a
goaltender
can
get
an
assist
anyone
who
follows
sports
with
regularity
knows
that
anything
can
happen
at
any
time
im
confident
in
the
pens
but
im
also
not
stupid
enough
to
think
for
one
minute
that
its
impossible
for
new
jersey
to
blow
them
out
of
this
series
i
doubt
that
will
happen
but
its
possible
bored
uhuh
spoiled
not
in
the
least
forgot
what
excitement
is
like
living
through
that
amazing
streak
wasnt
exciting
i
dont
take
a
darned
thing
for
granted
god
look
at
chicago
and
i
see
no
problem
with
quietly
savoring
all
of
this
anyway
it
isnt
gonna
last
forever
and
i
intend
to
enjoy
it
while
i
can
mom
