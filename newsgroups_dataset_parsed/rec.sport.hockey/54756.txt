REAL
FANS
THERE
WAS
A
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
HOW
REAL
FANS
WERE
ONES
WHO
RESPECT
THEIR
TEAMS
NO
MATTER
OW
BAD
THEY
ARE
THATS
BULLSHIT
ANYONE
WHO
WOULD
FOLLOW
THE
PENS
OR
THE
PIRATES
IN
PARTS
OF
THE
EARLY
EIGHTIES
ON
A
DEVOTED
BASIS
ARE
LOSERS
ITS
OK
TO
FOLLOW
AND
BE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
YOUR
HOME
TEAM
BUT
TO
GIVE
THEM
RESPECT
EVEN
WHEN
IT
IS
CLEAR
THE
MANAGEMENT
AND
THE
PLAYERS
SUCK
SHOULD
NOT
BE
REQUIRED
OF
A
TRUE
FANA
TRUE
FAN
WOULD
FOLLOW
THE
TEAM
IN
TROUBLED
TIMES
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
THEY
COULD
DISCUSS
HOW
TO
IMPROVE
THE
TEAM
WHEN
I
VISIT
PITTSBURGH
ILL
REFUSE
TO
GO
TO
A
PIRATES
GAME
SINCE
I
THINK
THE
MANAGEMENT
HAS
GIVEN
PITTSBURGH
A
TEAM
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
BETTER
EVEN
IF
THEY
COULDNT
SIGN
BARRY
BONDS
LERTS
SAY
THE
PENS
START
DOING
TO
THEIR
OWN
TEAM
WHAT
THE
OILERS
HAVE
DONE
THIS
YEAR
AND
WHAT
THE
WHALERS
HAVE
DONE
IN
RECENT
YEARS
I
WOULD
BE
HARD
PRESSED
TO
SHOW
MUCH
ENTHUSIASM
FOR
THE
TEAM
ILL
STILL
FOLLOW
IT
AND
BITCH
ABOUT
IT
BUT
I
WONT
WASTE
MY
MONEY
ON
MEDIOCRE
TEAMS
PRAVIN
RATNAM
