I
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
ESPN
IS
MAKING
SPORTSCHANNEL
AMERICA
LOOK
GOOD
BUT
ONLY
IN
NYNJ
PHILADELPHIA
AND
CHICAGO
EVERYWHERE
ELSE
THE
ONLY
REASON
SPORTSCHANNEL
WAS
AVAILABLE
WAS
FOR
LOCAL
BASEBALL
BROADCASTS
AND
LOCAL
BASEBALL
PREEMPTED
THE
NHL

NOT
ONLY
ARE
THEY
LEAFS
THE
BEST
TEAM
BUT
THEIR
FANS
ARE
EVEN
MORE
