re
lemieux
and
other
thoughts
i
think
that
nhlpa
is
the
best
video
game
available
now
of
course
many
things
could
be
done
better
but
i
really
appreciate
that
the
names
of
players
are
the
real
ones
no
matter
if
it
lacks
some
logos
i
am
still
playing
it
since
november
leading
different
teams
to
the
finals
and
making
scorers
from
the
same
team
compete
for
the
top
scoring
yesterday
i
won
the
title
using
toronto
against
hartford
games
to
two
i
played
the
playoffs
in
a
games
fashion
minutes
for
each
period
and
the
best
scorer
and
shooter
was
gilmour
shots
if
i
remember
well
