news
from
news
for
the
first
time
all
season
the
flames
are
now
injuryfree
the
only
player
remaining
on
the
limp
is
center
carey
wilson
who
even
when
healthy
is
not
a
major
part
of
the
team
trent
yawney
did
not
score
a
goal
all
season
until
the
last
regular
season
game
against
san
jose
he
potted
his
first
of
the
year
in
that
game
and
has
also
scored
goals
in
both
game
and
game
against
los
angeles
thoughts
on
game
the
flames
played
horribly
in
dropping
the
first
game
of
their
series
with
los
angeles
on
sunday
afternoon
they
seemed
more
interested
in
throwing
big
hits
than
in
scoring
goals
they
physically
dominated
the
kings
but
that
was
the
only
area
they
dominated
in
the
game
plan
was
to
rush
the
net
and
try
and
take
advantage
of
a
young
inexperienced
la
defence
and
the
shaky
kings
goaltending
but
those
plans
fell
by
the
wayside
while
the
flames
conducted
a
steady
march
to
the
penalty
box
particularily
stupid
was
theoren
fleury
taking
a
five
minute
major
and
a
game
misconduct
for
slamming
warren
rychels
face
into
the
dasher
while
rychel
was
on
his
knees
goaltender
mike
vernon
played
well
and
could
not
really
be
faulted
for
the
loss
despite
his
wellpublicized
poor
record
in
afternoon
games
he
got
very
little
support
from
his
defence
in
clearing
the
front
of
the
net
and
sweeping
away
rebounds
in
fact
marty
mcsorleys
goal
actually
went
in
off
chris
dahlquists
skate
in
front
of
the
net
thoughts
on
game
the
flames
came
back
strong
in
the
second
game
evidently
aware
of
the
potentially
fatal
consequences
of
losing
both
the
first
two
games
on
home
ice
the
first
period
was
fairly
even
with
the
edge
going
to
the
kings
but
calgary
came
out
strong
in
the
second
period
and
simply
dominated
the
kings
scoring
five
goals
to
take
a
lead
they
never
relinquished
en
route
to
a
win
the
deciding
factors
in
this
game
were
faceoffs
and
special
teams
calgary
dominated
on
faceoffs
as
they
did
in
game
but
they
were
able
to
make
better
use
of
the
won
faceoffs
in
this
game
than
they
did
in
the
first
one
calgary
also
went
on
the
powerplay
while
la
only
went
and
gave
up
a
shorthanded
goal
to
joel
otto
las
powerplay
goal
also
came
late
in
the
game
with
the
outcome
already
decided
the
kings
powerplay
failed
them
when
they
needed
it
most
in
the
and
periods
the
flames
lost
rw
greg
paslawski
with
a
suspected
shoulder
injury
when
he
was
leveled
by
alexei
zhitnik
right
after
scoring
calgarys
goal
charlie
huddy
left
the
game
for
the
kings
with
a
groin
injury
the
game
was
marred
by
stupidity
in
the
last
minute
first
craig
berube
of
calgary
took
a
fiveminute
major
for
fighting
plus
a
game
misconduct
for
instigating
when
he
went
after
tony
granato
for
no
apparent
reason
granato
drew
a
minor
for
some
strange
reason
turtling
perhaps
this
was
followed
seconds
later
by
warren
rychel
drawing
a
major
minor
and
game
misconduct
for
hitting
frank
musil
in
the
face
with
his
stick
and
then
instigating
a
fight
musil
got
a
fighting
major
for
some
similarily
strange
reason
hardy
and
yawney
went
toetotoe
and
both
got
double
minors
gregson
thought
that
musil
turtling
amounted
to
fighting
but
that
yawney
and
hardy
throwing
punches
at
each
other
was
just
roughing
