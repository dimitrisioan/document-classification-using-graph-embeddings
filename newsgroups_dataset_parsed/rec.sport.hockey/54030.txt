SUSAN
DART
WRITES
IF
ESPN
PISSES
YOU
OFF
CALL
THEM
THEY
DO
RESPOND
TO
CALLS
LAST
NIGHT
I
CALLED
WHEN
THEY
SAID
THEY
WERE
CUTTING
TO
BASEBALL
AND
WE
COULDNT
SEE
THE
SUDDENDEATH
OVERTIME
FOR
THE
BUFFALO
GAME
APPARENTLY
THEY
RECEIVED
ENOUGH
CALLS
SO
THEY
WAITED
FOR
THE
OVERTIME
TO
FINISH
BEFORE
CUTTING
AWAY
THEIR
PHONE
NUMBER
IS
SUSAN
DART
WELL
I
THINK
WHENEVER
ESPN
COVERS
THE
GAME
THEY
DO
A
WONDERFUL
JOB
BUT
WHAT
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
IS
THAT
THEY
CUT
THE
OT
JUST
SHOW
SOME
STUPID
BASEBALL
NEWS
WHICH
IS
NOT
IMPORTANT
AT
ALL
THEN
I
WAITED
FOR
THE
SCORES
TO
COMEON
SPORTSCENTER
BUT
THEY
TALK
ABOUT
BASEBALL
BASKETBALL
AND
FOOTBALL
THEN
THEY
SHOWED
PENGUINE
HIGHLIGHT
AND
WENT
BACK
TO
STUPID
BASKETBALL
FINALLY
THEY
SHOWED
A
HIGHLIGHT
OF
THE
OT
GOAL
BUT
THAT
WAS
LIKE
SEC
I
THINK
THEY
SHOULD
GIVE
MORE
ATTENTION
TO
NHL
DURING
THE
PLAYOFFS
THEN
TALKING
ABOUT
BORING
BASKETBALL
GAMES
I
GUESS
IT
IS
NHLS
FAULT
TOO
FOR
LEAVING
ESPN
HOPE
THINGS
IMPROVE
BY
NEXT
SEASON
COBRA
