RE
DON
CHERRY
HELP
ME
OUT
HERE
IN
ARTICLE
WILLIAM
K
WILLIS
WRITES
AS
A
PERSON
WHO
HAS
RARELY
EVEN
SEEN
DON
CHERRY
AND
DOESNT
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
HIM
I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
IT
IS
JUST
THIS
AREA
PITTSBURGH
OF
THE
USA
THAT
IS
DEPRIVED
OF
HIS
BROADCASTS
OR
WHETHER
HES
A
CANADIAN
THING
ALTOGETHER
SERIOUSLY
WHAT
IS
HE
ALL
ABOUT
I
HES
A
CANADIAN
THING
FORMER
COACH
OF
THE
BOSTON
BRUINS
AND
COLORADO
ROCKIES
FROM
THE
SUMMARIES
THAT
GET
POSTED
I
GATHER
THAT
HIS
ONGOING
BEEF
THIS
YEAR
HAS
BEEN
THE
CONVENTIONAL
WISDOM
THAT
CANADIAN
HOCKEY
IS
DOOMED
TO
BE
SECOND
OR
THIRD
RATE
BEHIND
THE
PERCEIVED
EMERGENCE
OF
THE
US
AND
EUROPEAN
PROGRAMS
KNOW
HE
WAS
A
COACH
AT
ONE
TIME
AND
FROM
THE
VOLUME
OF
POSTS
ABOUT
HIM
SOMEONE
SURELY
IS
GETTING
A
STEADY
DIET
OF
HIM
SOMEHOW
BUT
MY
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
IS
THE
DEAL
WITH
HIM
SECONDLY
ARE
THE
COMMENTS
OF
HIS
THAT
I
AFTER
HE
LEFT
THE
ROCKIES
HE
GOT
A
JOB
WITH
CBCS
HOCKEY
NIGHT
IN
CANADA
AND
HASNT
LOOKED
BACK
SINCE
ACTUALLY
HE
DID
WORK
FOR
CBC
AT
LEAST
ON
PLAYOFF
SEASON
AFTER
THE
ROCKIES
WERE
ELIMINATED
READ
ABOUT
ON
THE
NET
MERELY
FLAME
BAIT
OR
DO
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
TAKE
HIM
SERIOUSLY
I
GOTTA
TELL
YOU
FROM
WHAT
I
SEE
HE
REALLY
SOUNDS
LIKE
AN
ID
SAY
ITS
A
COMBINATION
OF
FLAME
BAIT
AND
SERIOUS
JOURNALISM
THE
CLOSEST
THING
YOULL
FIND
TO
CHERRY
IN
THE
US
IS
STAN
FISCHLER
A
SELFDESCRIBED
HOCKEY
MAVEN
THE
SIMILARITIES
ARE
THAT
THEY
BOTH
SAY
THINGS
THAT
GET
PEOPLE
UPSET
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
THAT
CHERRY
KNOWS
THE
GAME
AND
FISCHLER
DOESNT
ASS
LET
ME
KNOW
MAYBE
IM
MISSING
SOMETHING
DONS
A
CHARACTER
IF
HE
WERE
COMPLETELY
RATIONAL
AND
NONCONTROVERSIAL
HE
WOULDNT
HAVE
A
JOB
BY
SOME
DEFINITIONS
HE
COULD
BE
CALLED
AN
ASS
BUT
THEN
SOME
PEOPLE
FEEL
THE
SAME
ABOUT
MIKE
LANG
ANOTHER
CHARACTER
THAT
I
WISH
WOULD
GET
WIDER
EXPOSURE
ONLY
ONE
NATIONAL
TELECAST
LAST
YEAR
MIKE
EISLER
MREENGSUNCOM
NOT
ONLY
ARE
THEY
LEAFS
THE
BEST
TEAM
BUT
THEIR
FANS
ARE
EVEN
MORE
INTELLIGENT
AND
INSIGHTFUL
THAN
PITTSBURGHS
THEIR
PLAYERS
ARE
MIGHTY
BRIGHT
TOO
I
MEAN
HE
REALLY
WAS
GOING
TO
GET
HIS
WALLET
BACK
RIGHT
JAN
BRITTENSON
ON
LEAFPEN
WOOFERS
IN
RECSPORTHOCKEY
