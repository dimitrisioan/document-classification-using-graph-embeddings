REX
WANG
WRITES
ARE
PEOPLE
HERE
STUPID
OR
WHAT
IT
IS
A
TIE
BREAKER
OF
CAUSE
THEY
HAVE
TO
HAVE
THE
SAME
RECORD
HOW
CAN
PEOPLE
BE
SOOOOO
STUPPID
TO
PUT
WIN
AS
FIRST
IN
THE
LIST
FOR
TIE
BREAKER
IF
IT
IS
A
TIE
BREAKER
HOW
CAN
THERE
BE
DIFFERENT
RECORD
MAN
I
THOUGHT
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
NET
ARE
GOOD
WITH
HOCKEY
I
MIGHT
NOT
BE
GREAT
IN
MATH
BUT
TELL
ME
HOW
CAN
TWO
TEAMS
AHVE
THE
SAME
POINTS
WITH
DIFFERENT
RECORD
MANRETARD
CANT
BELIEVE
PEOPLE
ACTUALLY
PUT
WIN
AS
FIRST
IN
A
TIE
BREAKER
THEN
ALLOW
ME
TO
ENLIGHTEN
YOU
REX
YOU
SEE
THERES
A
THING
CALLED
A
TIE
A
TIE
IS
WORTH
ONE
POINT
I
KNOW
I
KNOW
YOURE
NOT
GOOD
AT
MATH
BUT
BEAR
WITH
ME
A
WIN
IS
WORTH
TWO
POINTS
SO
GETTING
TWO
TIES
IS
THE
SAME
AS
GETTING
ONE
WIN
IF
YOUR
TEAM
PLAYED
TWO
GAMES
WON
ONE
AND
LOST
ONE
YOUD
HAVE
TWO
POINTS
IF
MY
TEAM
PLAYED
TWO
GAMES
AND
TIED
THEM
BOTH
WED
ALSO
HAVE
TWO
POINTS
WED
BE
TIED
IN
THE
STANDINGS
EVEN
THOUGH
OUR
RECORDS
ARE
DIFFERENT
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULD
LEARN
SOMETHING
ABOUT
HOCKEY
BEFORE
POSTING
AGAIN
I
AM
STARTING
TO
SOUND
LIKE
ROGER
OR
WHAT
ALAN
