AT
THE
WORLD

MARKUS
HAD
A
GOOD
SEASON
IN
MODO
IN
THE
SWEDISH
ELITE
LEAGUE
SCORING
GOALS

MARKUS
WONT
BE
JOINING
THE

THERE
IS
A
GOOD
CHANCE
THAT

BEFORE
NEXT
SEASON
MODO

NATURALLY
WANTS
TO
KEEP
THEIR
SUPERSTARS
FORSBERG
AND

IS
LOOKING
FOR
PERSONAL
SPONSORS
FOR
FORSBERG

IN
ORDER
TO

THE
KIND
OF

TURNER
WRITES
BY
THE

I
WOULD
ASSUME
YOU

YOUR
BREATH
YOU
ARENT
GOING
TO
SEE
NASLUND
THIS
YEAR
THE
WORLD
CHAMPIONSHIP

NHL
TEAMS
WONT
SEE
ANY
INFLUX
OF
EUROPEANS
AND
NO
TEAM
PLAYING

THE
WC
WILL
SEE
A
SUDDEN
INFLUX

THAT
LONG
ACTUALLY
SWEDISH

IS
THINKING
ABOUT

LATE

RECALL
THAT
