if
theres
anyone
who
can
help
me
on
these
items
please
let
me
know
markus
naslund
i
saw
that
modo
lost
early
in
the
national
tournament
and
that
he
was
playing
for
the
national
team
at
the
world
championships
any
stats
available
any
word
on
how
hes
playing
when
is
he
expected
to
join
the
club
markus
had
a
good
season
in
modo
in
the
swedish
elite
league
scoring
goals
assists
points
and
pim
in
games
as
daryl
points
out
markus
wont
be
joining
the
pens
for
this
years
playoffs
since
the
world
championships
starts
april
but
there
is
a
good
chance
that
markus
will
join
the
pens
before
next
season
modo
though
naturally
wants
to
keep
their
superstars
forsberg
and
naslund
so
the
latest
news
on
this
is
that
modo
is
looking
for
personal
sponsors
for
forsberg
and
naslund
in
order
to
match
the
kind
of
money
they
would
receive
in
nhl

i
would
assume
you
mean
the
pens
dont
hold
your
breath
you
arent
going
to
see
naslund
this
year
the
world
championship
tournament
doesnt
start
until
april
so
nhl
teams
wont
see
any
influx
of
europeans
and
no
team
playing
in
the
wc
will
see
a
sudden
influx
of
eliminated
nhlers
the
earliest
a
player
on
a
playoff
bound
team
could
join
a
wcteam
is
the
last
game
of
the
round
robin
and
i
doubt
any
coach
is
going
to
want
to
play
short
one
player
for
that
long
actually
swedish
coach
curt
lundmark
is
thinking
about
leaving
two
spots
open
for
additions
from
eliminated
nhlers
it
is
mats
sundin
and
calle
johansson
that
curt
hopes
can
join
the
team
although
in
a
late
stage
of
the
tournament
technically
i
seem
to
recall
that
you
can
leave
spots
open
until
hrs
before
the
wc
final
