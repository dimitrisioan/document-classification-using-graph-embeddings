RE
WINGS
NEWS
AND
PLAYOFF
THOUGHTS
FROM
KWOLFEREAGLEWESLEYANEDU
IN
ARTICLE
KCSMITHMTUEDU
SMITH
WRITES
I
DONT
THINK
HES
SHOWN
THAT
HES
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
CARRY
DETROIT
TO
THE
CUP
THE
TEAM
MAY
BE
GOOD
ENOUGH
TO
REACH
THE
FINALS
BUT
CHEVELDAE
IS
THEIR
ACHILLES
HEEL
YOU
MUST
HAVE
GOALTENDING
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
AND
CHEVELDAE
LOOKS
LIKE
AN
OVERMATCHED
OR
STRINGER
WHICH
HE
PROBABLY
I
GUESS
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
TOO
MANY
OR
STRING
GOALIES
THAT
COULD
POST
OVER
WINS
IN
A
SEASON
CHEVY
HAS
DONE
THAT
THE
PAST
TWO
SEASONS
PLAYING
BEHIND
A
DEFENSE
THAT
IS
NOT
EXACTLY
THE
BEST
IN
THE
LEAGUE
HIS
WINS
THIS
YEAR
WERE
NOT
ALL
AGAINST
TORONTO
AND
FOR
THOSE
WHO
LOOK
AT
VINCENT
RIEN
STATS
AND
THINK
HE
SHOULD
BE
STARTING
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
TEAMS
HE
PLAYED
AGAINST
TEAMS
LIKE
SAN
JOSE
OTTAWA
AND
TB
ANY
NHL
GOALIE
COULD
POST
A
DECENT
RECORD
PLAYING
TEAMS
LIKE
THAT
NIGHT
IN
AND
NIGHT
OUT
IS
LOOK
FOR
DETROIT
MANAGEMENT
TO
REMEDY
THE
SITUATION
IN
THE
OFFSEASON
I
REALLY
DONT
SEE
THIS
HAPPENING
IF
THEY
DIDNT
THINK
CHEVELDAE
COULD
DO
THE
JOB
THEY
WOULD
OF
TRADED
FOR
SOMEBODY
THIS
YEAR
AFTER
ALL
WHY
WAIT
UNTIL
NEXT
YEAR
WHEN
THERE
WERE
GOALIES
AVAILABLE
THIS
YEAR
HEY
I
MAY
BE
WRONG
BUT
AFTER
WATCHING
HIM
KICK
REBOUND
AFTER
REBOUND
INTO
THE
HIGH
SLOT
I
DONT
THINK
HE
CAN
CARRY
THEM
IN
THE
TOUGH
GAMES
IE
THOSE
NOT
AGAINST
TORONTO
BETTER
TO
KICK
OUT
REBOUNDS
THAN
TO
LET
GOALS
IN
IF
ST
LOUIS
GETS
PAST
CHICAGO
WATCH
FOR
JOSEPH
TO
CARRY
THE
BLUES
PAST
AN
OTHERWISE
VASTLY
SUPERIOR
RED
WINGS
CLUB
JOSEPH
IS
HOT
BUT
SO
ARE
THE
WINGS
THEY
HAVE
SCORED
SIX
GOALS
IN
BOTH
OF
THEIR
GAMES
SO
FAR
WITH
TORONTO
SUPPOSIVELY
ONE
OF
THE
LEAGUES
BEST
DEFENSES
I
GUESS
IF
THEY
END
UP
PLAYING
FOR
THE
NORRIS
TITLE
WELL
SEE
WHAT
HAPPENS
DRD
THE
DEVILS
ADVOCATE
DRINKIN
WOMEN
GUNS
DONT
MIX
AWKORBUTACSUBUFFALOEDU
MARK
ARM
KCS
WINGS
IN
OR
HOPEFULLY
BY
AS
FAR
AS
CHEVELDAE
IS
CONCERNED
HE
IS
A
DECENT
GOALIE
THE
MOST
LOGICAL
TRADE
IN
THE
OFFSEASON
TO
ME
WOULD
BE
BETWEEN
DETROIT
AND
NY
RANGERS
IM
SURE
IF
BEEZER
WOULD
BE
TRADED
HE
WOULD
ENJOY
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GO
BACK
TO
HIS
ROOTS
IN
DETROIT
HE
WOULD
BE
A
VALUABLE
ASSET
TO
THE
WINGS
AND
PERHAPS
THE
RANGERS
COULD
GET
A
ZOMBO
IN
RETURN
BEEZER
GOT
A
FEW
GOOD
YEARS
IN
HIM
AND
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GET
A
FRESH
START
WOULD
ENERGIZE
HIS
PLAY
