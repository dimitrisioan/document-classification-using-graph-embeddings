RE
RON
FRANCIS
MATTHEW
RUSH
WRITES
IS
THERE
AN
AWARD
FOR
BEST
BACKUP
BEHIND
A
HOCKEY
GREAT
UNDERNEATH
ALL
THE
HYPE
ABOUT
LEMIEUX
STEVENS
JAGR
ULF
ETC
RON
FRANCIS
HAS
QUIETLY
PUT
TOGETHER
A
POINT
SEASON
GOALS
AND
ASSISTS
IN
GAMES
THAT
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
BEST
ACQUISITION
THE
PENGUINS
HAVE
MADE
SINCE
GETTING
LEMIEUX
APOLOGIES
TO
RICK
TOCCHET
WHO
HAS
HAD
A
HELL
OF
A
YEAR
HIMSELF
THE
PENS
GOT
JUST
THE
RIGHT
PERSON
AT
JUST
THE
RIGHT
TIME
WHEN
THEY
GOT
FRANCIS
BEFORE
THE
PLAYOFFS
TWO
YEARS
AGO
TO
BACKUP
MARIO
WHO
WAS
THE
SECONDLINE
CENTER
BEFORE
THEY
GOT
FRANCIS
I
REMEMBER
RANDY
GILHEN
WHO
REALLY
PLAYS
TOUGH
AN
ACE
IN
THE
FACEOFF
CIRCLE
BUT
NOBODY
WITH
ALL
THE
SKILLS
FRANCIS
HAS
SCORING
PASSING
WINNING
FACEOFFS
AND
PUTTING
INTO
EVERY
GAME
EVERY
NIGHT
JUST
WANTED
TO
GLOW
A
LITTLE
I
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
I
GLOW
EVERYTIME
RONNIES
OUT
ON
THE
ICE
IN
FACT
ONE
OF
THE
NEATEST
THINGS
ABOUT
SEEING
THE
PENS
IN
PERSON
IS
THAT
I
CAN
KEY
IN
ON
HIM
INSTEAD
OF
WATCHING
WHAT
ID
PROBABLY
BE
SEEING
ON
TV
HE
DOES
SO
MANY
SUBTLE
THINGS
BEHIND
THE
PLAY
HE
SAID
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
RECENTLY
THAT
WHEN
HE
WAS
A
KID
HIS
DAD
STRESSED
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
PLAYING
TWOWAY
HOCKEY
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
LEARN
HOW
TO
PLAY
DEFENSE
AS
WELL
AS
OFFENSE
AND
HE
OBVIOUSLY
TOOK
THAT
ADVICE
TO
HEART
HE
WAS
A
BREATH
OF
FRESH
AIR
WHEN
HE
ARRIVED
IN
PITTSBURGH
TO
THE
TEAM
WHOSE
FORWARDS
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
COULDNT
AND
WOULDNT
PLAY
A
LICK
OF
DEFENSE
ITS
REALLY
DIFFICULT
TO
ASSESS
WHAT
THE
KEY
TRADES
WERE
THAT
BROUGHT
ALL
OF
THIS
SUCCESS
TO
THE
PENS
YOU
MENTION
RICK
TOCCHET
AND
HE
HAS
CERTAINLY
HELPED
AND
EVEN
OL
KJELL
HAS
BEEN
STEADY
BUT
LOOKING
AT
THIS
TEAM
YOU
COULD
ALMOST
TAKE
ANY
ONE
OF
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
LINEUP
PERMANENTLY
AND
REPLACE
THEM
WITH
AN
EXTREMELY
MEDIOCRE
PLAYER
AND
IT
WOULDNT
MATTER
IF
I
HAD
TO
PICK
THE
TOP
THREE
ACQUISITIONS
IN
RECENT
YEARS
THEY
WOULD
BE
TOM
BARRASSO
RON
FRANCIS
LARRY
MURPHY
ID
LOVE
TO
PUT
FRANCIS
FIRST
BUT
I
DO
THINK
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
COULD
REALLY
DAMAGE
THE
PENS
RIGHT
NOW
WOULD
BE
TO
LOSE
BARRASSO
MOM
