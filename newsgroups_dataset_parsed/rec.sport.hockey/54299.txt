WRITES
READING
THROUGH
MOST
OF
THESE
HOCKEY
NEWS
I
DONT
SEE
MANY
RANGER
FANS
WRITING
WERE
HERE
TALKING
ABOUT
HOCKEY
WE
DONT
GO
AWAY
LIKE
SOME
TEAMS
FANS
WHEN
THE
RANGERS
BITE
THE
BIG
ONE
YEAH
I
THINK
WERE
USED
TO
IT
BY
NOW
EVEN
IF
SOME
OF
US
DO
CHANGE
OUR
SIGS
TO
ROOT
FOR
OUR
SECOND
FAVORITE
TEAMS
IM
NEW
TO
THIS
SYSTEM
AND
A
BIG
HOCKEY
FAN
AND
A
LONG
RANGER
FAN
BUT
REMEMBER
SUFFERING
BUILDS
CHARACTER
I
DONT
CARE
I
WANT
MY
FCKING
STANLEY
CUP
BEFORE
I
DIE
AARGH
ILL
BE
HAPPY
IF
THEY
WIN
IT
BEFORE
I
GET
OUT
OF
SCHOOL
THE
WAY
ITS
GOING
I
MAY
BE
HERE
SAYING
PILED
HIGHER
AND
DEEPER
BEFORE
LONG
RANGER
FANS
MAY
BE
SUFFERING
BUT
WERE
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
LOYAL
UNLIKE
ISLANDER
FANS
WHO
ONLY
SHOW
UP
WHEN
THE
TEAM
WINS
THIS
HAS
BEEN
OBSERVED
MANY
TIMES
ITS
TRUE
DEFINITELY
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THAT
ALOT
OF
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
MAY
NOT
LIKE
THIS
STATEMENT
BUT
BY
FAR
THE
WORST
BAND
WAGON
FANS
ARE
THE
PIT
FANS
AT
LEAST
AT
THE
PRESENT
CASE
IN
POINT
I
KNOW
A
GUY
WHO
JUST
CAME
TO
HOCKEY
HELLTM
FROM
PITT
U
HIM
HOW
BOUT
THE
PENS
THERE
FING
AWESOME
ME
YEAH
BUT
BEATING
UP
ON
THE
DEVILS
DOESNT
MEAN
ALOT
WAIT
UNTIL
THEY
MEET
BOSTON
ANDOR
DETROIT
IN
THE
PLAYOFFS
START
HIM
WHEN
DO
THE
PLAYOFFS
START
ME
UHHHH
THEY
STARTED
A
WEEK
AGO
IM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
THIS
IS
TRUE
OF
ALL
THE
WADDLERS
FANS
BUT
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
ALOT
OF
THEM
FLOATING
AROUND
WHO
REALLY
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
HOCKEY
EXCEPT
THAT
THEYRE
NEWLY
BELOVED
WADDLERS
ARE
THE
BEST
TEAM
IN
THE
GAME
RIGHT
NOW
AND
WHEN
THEYRE
NOT
THE
BEST
TEAM
THOSE
FANS
WILL
DISAPPEAR
INTO
THE
WOODWORK

THINK
THERES
ONLY
ONE
TEAM
THAT
CAN
TEST
PITTSBURGH
AND
THATS
DETROIT

WOULD
BE
