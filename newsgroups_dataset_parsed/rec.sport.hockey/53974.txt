WRITES
WHEN
WAS
THE
LAST
TIME
A
PRESIDENTS
TROPHY
WINNER
FELL
TO
LAST
PLACE
THE
FOLLOWING
YEAR
A
LONG
TIME
ID
BET
WELL
I
THINK
IT
IN
THE
MONTREAL
CANADIANS
FINISHED
ALTHOUGH
THERE
WAS
NO
PRESIDENTS
CUP
IN
THOSE
DAYS
AND
MISSED
THE
PLAYOFFS
IN
I
DO
RECALL
THAT
THE
PLAYOFF
PICTURE
WASNT
DECIDED
UNTIL
THE
FINAL
DAY
WHEN
THE
NY
RANGERS
DEFEATED
THE
REDWINGS
THE
TIEBREAKER
WAS
THE
NUMBER
OF
GOALS
FOR
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
SO
THE
RANGERS
PLAYED
WITH
AN
EMPTY
NET
FOR
THE
ENTIRE
GAME
SOME
HAB
LOYALISTS
ACCUSED
THE
WINGS
OF
THROWING
THE
GAME
TO
KEEP
THEM
OUT
BUT
AS
I
RECALL
GORDIE
AND
DELVECCHIO
HAD
THE
FLU
SO
COACH
SID
ABEL
SAT
THEM
OUT
AND
THE
RANGERS
SWARMED
THE
REDWINGS
MOST
OF
THE
NIGHT
