the
pens
wont
be
playing
montreal
because
boston
will
win
adams
divisional
play
buffalo
and
quebec
will
make
decent
showings
boston
out
of
sheer
determination
will
win
a
game
against
the
pens
but
no
more
they
have
heart
but
the
pens
have
too
many
big
guns
and
too
many
ways
to
win
if
boston
does
indeed
win
the
adams
nothing
is
certain
and
indeed
gets
to
play
the
pens
then
i
think
youll
find
a
very
different
boston
team
this
year
boston
will
use
every
trick
in
the
book
to
shut
down
the
pens
offense
something
they
didnt
even
try
last
year
the
pens
weak
spot
is
defense
and
goaltending
if
boston
first
i
enjoyed
reading
your
post
second
i
disagree
with
the
pens
weak
spot
being
defense
and
goaltending
for
a
couple
of
reasons
barrasso
has
had
a
spectacular
year
no
slow
start
consistently
sharp
gaa
and
leads
the
league
in
wins
tommy
deserves
the
vezina
given
the
lack
of
respect
he
commands
though
i
doubt
he
will
win
it
the
other
reason
concerns
the
pens
team
defense
they
are
hovering
around
or
in
the
fewest
goals
allowed
that
is
a
big
improvement
for
them
and
it
indicates
that
they
are
playing
better
team
defense
can
shut
down
the
pens
offense
and
get
an
early
goal
then
you
have
a
real
game
if
the
pens
score
first
then
its
practically
over
i
dont
think
the
pens
have
the
discipline
to
stick
to
the
team
game
if
theyre
held
scoreless
minutes
into
the
second
boston
doesnt
have
the
guns
of
the
pens
but
the
pens
doesnt
have
the
defense
goaltending
and
discipline
of
boston
still
boston
can
put
the
puck
in
the
net
remember
that
boston
is
not
a
runandgun
patrickstyle
team
although
they
played
runandgun
hockey
for
the
better
part
of
the
regular
season
who
doesnt
even
neely
backchecks
all
the
way
in
behind
his
own
net
if
necessary
penaltykilling
will
be
a
big
factor
boston
are
i
believe
over
the
last
shorthanded
situations
meaning
they
have
scored
shg
while
giving
up
ppg
one
in
a
lackluster
game
against
ottawa
id
say
the
series
will
go
to
or
but
im
much
less
certain
whether
it
will
be
in
favor
of
the
pens
or
the
bs
their
styles
going
into
the
playoffs
are
too
different
to
make
it
predictable
still
id
place
my
bets
on
the
pens
i
think
my
prediction
is
that
if
the
bs
can
get
the
first
goal
in
four
of
the
games
theyll
take
the
series
otherwise
the
pens
will
but
id
rather
wait
and
see
whether
the
bs
will
actually
get
out
of
the
adams
to
begin
with
buffalo
quebec
and
montreal
arent
exactly
planning
to
call
it
a
game
and
go
home
