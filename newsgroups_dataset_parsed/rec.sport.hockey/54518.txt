RE
NHL
LETTER
ROGERS
RESPONSE
AGAIN
I
ASSUME
THIS
IS
NOT
JUST
FLAME
BAIT
BY
ROGER
BUT
ACTUALLY
A
TRULY
HELD
OPINION
IN
ARTICLE
MAYNARDRAMSEYCSLAURENTIANCA
ROGER
MAYNARD
WRITES
I
WOULD
SAY
THAT
THE
LETTER
CLEARLY
IMPLIES
REPRESENTATION
OF
THE
VIEWS
OF
A
GROUP
THAT
I
BELONG
TO
AND
I
DONT
SHARE
THOSE
VIEWS
AND
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
POSTERS
ON
RSHOCKEY
SHARE
THOSE
VIEWS
AND
SO
I
HAVE
NO
INTENTION
OF
ALLOWING
THEM
TO
SIMPLY
GO
AHEAD
WITHOUT
MAKING
MY
FEELINGS
ON
THE
SUBJECT
CLEAR
THANKS
FOR
SPEAKING
FOR
ALL
THOSE
WHO
DIDNT
FEEL
IT
WAS
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
SOMETHING
THEMSELVES
I
WOULDNT
SAY
THAT
THE
LETTER
CLEARLY
IMPLIES
REPRESENTATION
OF
THE
VIEWS
OF
A
GROUP
THAT
YOU
BELONG
TO
IT
REPRESENTS
A
SUBSET
THAT
YOU
DONT
BELONG
TO
OF
A
LARGER
GROUP
WHICH
YOU
DO
IF
ONLY
BECAUSE
THIS
ISNT
A
MODERATED
GROUP
LOOK
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
WAYS
TO
STATE
AN
OPPOSING
VIEWPOINT
THREE
THAT
COME
TO
MIND
ARE
AS
FOLLOWS
SAY
IT
SUBTLY
RESULT
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
CLEAR
SAY
IT
DIRECTLY
YET
POLITELY
RESULT
PROBABLY
IT
WILL
SPARK
SOME
INTERESTING
CONVERSATION
SAY
IT
DIRECTLY
AND
OBNOXIOUSLY
RESULT
VALIDITY
GOES
RIGHT
OUT
THE
WINDOW
I
WOULD
AGREE
THAT
UNWARRANTED
USE
OF
SAID
TERM
IS
ENTIRELY
IMMATURE
YOU
REALIZE
THAT
ANYTHING
YOU
SAY
CAN
AND
MOST
CERTAINLY
WILL
BE
USED
AGAINST
YOU
