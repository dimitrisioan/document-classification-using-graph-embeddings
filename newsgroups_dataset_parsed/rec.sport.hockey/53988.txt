RE
SHARKS
JACK
FEIRERRA
WAS
RE
SHARKS
KINGSTON
FIRED
GAKWRSCOM
RICHARD
STUEVEN
WRITES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IM
HARD
PRESSED
TO
THINK
OF
ANY
OTHER
REAL
MISTAKES
FEREIRRA
MADE
IMAGINE
INDEED
BUT
THEN
AGAIN
WE
HAVE
THE
BENEFIT
OF
HINDSIGHT
WELL
THE
JETTISON
FOR
YOUTH
FAST
STRATEGY
WAS
HIS
ALSO
IN
HINDSIGHT
IT
DIDNT
WORK
ALL
THAT
WELL
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WAS
MORE
BECAUSE
IT
LEFT
THE
SHARKS
ON
A
TIGHTROPE
WITHOUT
A
NET
NOT
THAT
IT
WAS
INHERENTLY
FLAWED
IT
WAS
THE
INJURIES
THAT
CAUSED
US
TO
FALL
LETS
SAY
THAT
IN
THE
VIEW
OF
THE
SHARKS
UPPER
MANAGEMENT
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
TRADE
KISIO
WAS
A
MAJOR
FACTOR
IN
THE
DECISION
TO
FIRE
FEIRERRA
FROM
ALL
INDICATIONS
IT
WASNT
THE
MAJOR
FACTOR
BUT
THE
LAST
STRAW
THERE
WERE
PERSONALITY
CONFLICTS
AMONG
SHARK
MANAGEMENT
AND
DISAGREEMENTS
OVER
HOW
PERSONNEL
WERE
GOING
TO
BE
HANDLED
NOT
JUST
WHO
WAS
BEING
TRADED
VS
KEPT
BUT
WHO
WAS
BEING
SENT
TO
KC
WHAT
FERRIERA
DID
IF
RUMORS
ARE
RIGHT
WAS
NOT
ALWAYS
WHAT
THE
FOLKS
BEHIND
THE
BENCH
WANTED
OR
NEEDED
IM
INCLINED
TO
TAKE
EXACTLY
THE
OPPOSITE
VIEW
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
KEPT
HIMHES
OBVIOUSLY
THE
LUCKIEST
MAN
IN
HOCKEY
I
THINK
IF
THEYD
KEPT
FERRIERA
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
LOST
SOME
OF
THEIR
OTHER
MANAGEMENT
STAFF
DEPENDING
ON
WHICH
SOURCES
YOU
TRUST
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
LOST
GRILLO
AND
LOMBARDI
AND
MURDOCH
OVER
THE
SUMMER
FRANKLY
I
WANT
TO
KEEP
THOSE
THREE
WE
MAY
WELL
AHVE
ALSO
LOST
KINGSTON
WHICH
OF
COURSE
IS
NOW
A
MOOT
POINT
THE
SHARKS
HAVE
BEEN
BUILDING
AN
ORGANIZATIONAL
STAFF
THAT
IS
HIGHLY
CONSENSUAL
AND
COOPERATIVE
FERRIERA
WANTED
TO
RUN
THINGS
HIS
WAY
THERE
WERE
CONFLICTS
FERRIERA
LOST
THAT
SAYS
NOTHING
ABOUT
HIS
SKILLS
OR
ACCOMPLISHMENTS
AT
THAT
LEVEL
A
LOT
IS
PERSONALITY
AND
POLITICS
I
THINK
HE
DID
SOME
GOOD
THINGS
FOR
THE
SHARKS
BUT
THAT
HE
NEVER
FIT
IN
AS
A
SHARK
PERSON
I
HOPE
HE
SUCCEEDS
BEYOND
HIS
WILDEST
DREAMS
DOWN
IN
ANAHEIM
TOO
BECAUSE
ITLL
BE
GOOD
FOR
HOCKEY
BUT
I
WANT
THE
DUCKS
TO
BE
DOORMATS
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
SO
THE
SHARKS
SUCCEEED
FIRST
