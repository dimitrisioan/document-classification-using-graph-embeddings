RE
FLYERS
RE
THIS
YEARS
BIGGEST
AND
WORST
OPINION
IN
ARTICLE
SETHCBNEWSHCBATTCOM
PETERRCLARKJR
WRITES
SO
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
ROUSSEL
SHUTS
OUT
THE
SHARKS
AND
SODERSTROM
SHUTS
OUT
THE
PENGUINS
THATS
IMMATERIAL
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
THE
COACHES
DECISION
COME
ON
JOE
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
YOURE
SAYING
WHO
THEY
PLAYED
IS
VERY
SIGNIFICANT
WHY
THEY
PLAYED
THEM
IS
WHATS
IRRELEVENT
A
LOW
GAA
AGAINST
GOOD
TEAMS
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
LOW
GAA
AGAINST
BAD
TEAMS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
COMPARING
TWO
GOALTENDERS
A
LOW
GAA
IS
BETTER
THEN
A
HIGHER
GAA
A
LOW
GAA
AGAINST
GOOD
TEAMS
IS
MUCH
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
A
HIGHER
GAA
AGAINST
BAD
TEAMS
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
COMPARING
TWO
GOALTENDERS
LETS
START
OVER
IM
NOT
ARGUING
ABOUT
WHO
IS
THE
BETTER
GOALTENDER
ID
TAKE
SODERSTROM
RIGHT
NOW
WHAT
I
AM
SAYING
IS
THAT
ROUSSEL
CAN
BE
A
NETMINDER
THE
GAA
DIFFERENCE
IS
LESS
THAN
HALF
A
GOAL
PER
GAME
LESS
THAN
THAT
AFTER
LAST
NIGHT
THEIR
SAVE
PERCENTAGES
ARE
CLOSE
AND
THEIR
RECORDS
ARE
SIMILAR
AND
WITH
THAT
I
JUST
DONT
SEE
HOW
YOU
CAN
LABEL
ROUSSEL
AS
THE
MOST
DISAPPOINTING
PLAYER
ON
THE
FLYERS
THIS
SEASON
YOU
SAY
SODERSTROM
PLAYED
AGAINST
BETTER
COMPETITION
THAT
MAY
VERY
WELL
BE
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
HOW
ROUSSEL
WOULD
HAVE
PERFORMED
IN
THOSE
GAMES
BESIDES
AGAINST
THE
BETTER
SCORING
TEAMS
LIKE
PITTSBURGH
THE
DEFENSE
IS
MORE
KEYED
UP
THAN
THEY
ARE
AGAINST
SAN
JOSE
THE
SAME
FOR
ROUSSEL
IN
THE
RANGER
GAME
TWO
REAL
SCORING
CHANCES
ONE
HE
MADE
A
GREAT
PLAY
THE
OTHER
HE
WAS
SAVED
BY
A
MISTAKE
FROM
THE
OTHER
PLAYER
IF
YOU
WERE
JUDGING
ROUSSEL
ON
THAT
GAME
ALONE
YOU
HAVE
VERY
LITTLE
TO
GO
BY
BUT
IM
NOT
JUST
JUDGING
ROUSSEL
ON
THAT
GAME
ALONE
IVE
SEEN
HIM
PLAY
FOR
THE
PAST
TWO
SEASONS
IN
PHILLY
AND
BEFORE
THAT
IN
HERSHEY
ITS
JUST
MY
OPINION
BUT
I
THINK
HES
GOT
WHAT
IT
TAKES
OF
COURSE
I
THOUGHT
THAT
ABOUT
MARK
LAFOREST
TOO
BUT
I
NEVER
DID
ABOUT
WENDELL
YOUNG
SO
IM
BATTING
IN
JUDGING
HERSHEY
TALENT
SINCE
THE
HEXTALLERA
AS
FOR
THE
RANGERS
GAME
YOU
CAN
SAY
HE
WAS
SAVED
BY
A
MISTAKE
BY
THE
OFFENSIVE
PLAYER
IF
YOU
LIKE
BUT
ROU
HAD
HIS
LEG
IN
POSITION
TO
MAKE
THE
SAVE
IF
HE
DIDNT
IT
WOULDNT
HAVE
MATTERED
IF
THE
RANGERS
PLAYER
DIDNT
GET
THE
PUCK
UP
OR
NOT
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
GOAL
ON
A
BREAKAWAY
THATS
WHAT
THE
GOALIE
WANTS
TO
DO
TAKE
AWAY
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
FORCE
THE
SHOOTER
TO
BEAT
HIM
BUT
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
TIE
AGAINST
THE
HABS
YOU
SAW
A
GOALIE
STAND
ON
HIS
HEAD
TO
GET
THAT
SHUTOUT
THAT
WAS
A
GOALIE
IN
ACTION
ROUSSEL
DOESNT
HAVE
A
GAME
LIKE
THAT
IN
HIM
I
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
ROUSSEL
DOING
AN
EXCELLENT
JOB
AGAINST
PITTSURGH
ON
OPENING
NIGHT
TO
GIVE
THE
FLYERS
A
TIE
AGAINST
THE
TWOTIME
DEFENDING
CHAMPS
AND
NOT
TO
TAKE
ANYTHING
AWAY
FROM
SODERSTROM
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
SENATIONAL
IN
THAT
GAME
AGAINS
THE
HABS
BUT
YOU
CANT
TELL
ME
THAT
A
MONTREAL
PLAYER
HAD
AN
OPEN
NET
TO
SHOOT
AT
SOME
POINT
DURING
THAT
GAME
AND
JUST
FLAT
OUT
MISSED
IT
MISTAKES
BOTH
ON
OFFENSE
AND
DEFENSE
ARE
PART
OF
THE
GAME
OR
THERED
NEVER
BE
SHUTOUTS
ANYWAY
IM
HAPPY
THE
FLYERS
HAVE
BOTH
SODERSTROM
AND
ROUSSEL
AND
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
ARGUE
ABOUT
IT
ANYMORE
BESIDES
WITH
THE
CURRENT
WINNING
STREAK
AND
EXPECTATIONS
SOARING
FOR
NEXT
YEAR
I
DONT
WANT
TO
PISS
YOU
OFF
TO
THE
POINT
THAT
YOU
DONT
SELL
ME
ANY
TICKETS
