THANKS
FOR
THE
GOALS
BY
STEVE
SMITH
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
MORE
PEOPLE
DONT
BLAME
GRANT
FUHR
FOR
THE
GOAL
THAT
SMITH
PUT
IN
HIS
OWN
NET
ITS
COMMON
TO
PLAY
THE
PUCK
BACK
TO
YOUR
OWN
GOALIE
WHEN
DEEP
IN
YOUR
OWN
END
AND
UNDER
LITTLE
OR
NO
PRESSURE
FROM
THE
OFFENSIVE
TEAM
IF
FUHR
HAD
BEEN
IN
POSITION
THE
PUCK
WOULD
HAVE
NEVER
CROSSED
THE
LINE
FROM
THIS
ACCOUNT
IT
DOESNT
SOUND
LIKE
YOU
EVEN
SAW
THE
GOAL
MIKE
SMITH
CAME
OUT
FROM
BEHIND
HIS
OWN
NET
AND
FIRED
A
BREAKOUT
PASS
THAT
HIT
FUHR
IN
THE
BACK
OF
THE
LEG
FUHR
WAS
BACKING
UP
AT
THE
TIME
AND
NEVER
SAW
WHAT
HAPPENED
THE
PUCK
WENT
STRAIGHT
OFF
FUHRS
LEG
AND
INTO
THE
NET
FUHR
NEVER
HAD
A
CHANCE
THERE
WAS
NO
PLAY
BACK
TO
THE
GOALTENDER
IN
FACT
PERRY
BEREZAN
OF
CALGARY
HAD
JUST
DUMPED
IT
IN
AND
SMITH
WAS
RETRIEVING
IT
IT
WAS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
IT
HAPPENED
SMITH
IS
A
NICE
GUY
AND
WAS
ONLY
A
ROOKIE
AT
THE
TIME
AND
ON
HIS
BIRTHDAY
TOO
BUT
ALL
THE
BLAME
LIES
WITH
HIM
STARTING
IN
PEEWEE
COACHES
TELL
PLAYERS
NEVER
TO
MAKE
A
CROSSICE
PASS
IN
FRONT
OF
THEIR
OWN
NET
TOO
MUCH
CHANCE
OF
HAVING
IT
INTERCEPTED
OR
HITTING
THE
GOALTENDER
OR
WHATEVER
AND
TO
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
SAY
THAT
SMITH
COST
THE
OILERS
THE
SERIES
I
CAN
ONLY
SAY
THAT
HE
CERTAINLY
DIDNT
CAUSE
THE
TEAM
TO
LOSE
THE
OTHER
THREE
GAMES
THERE
WAS
NO
REASON
FOR
A
POWERHOUSE
TEAM
LIKE
EDMONTON
TO
BE
TIED
LATE
IN
THE
THIRD
PERIOD
OF
THE
GAME
OF
THE
SECOND
ROUND
EVERYBODY
ON
THE
TEAM
HAS
TO
TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THEM
EVEN
BEING
IN
THAT
SITUATION
ALAN
