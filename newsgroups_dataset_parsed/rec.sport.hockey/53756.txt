wound
up
with
a
double
minor
for
roughing
a
single
minor
for
cross

right
out
of

on
the
plus
side
the

for
the
most
part
played
very
disciplined
hockey
as
they
let
calgary
retaliate
the
kings
played
good
team
defense
and
excellent
penalty
killing
on
the
minus
side
the
kings
lost
almost
every
faceoff
this
must
improve
or
the

will
surely
get
that
power
play
back
on
