no
no
no
since
all
the
penalties
fall
into
three
classes
there
should
only
be
three
penalties
foul
any
illegal
contact
with
the
other
player
or
his
stick
with
your
body
or
stick
if
you
get
you
are
out
for
the
game
unsportsmanlike
contact
an
intentional
foul
this
inlcludes
all
the
current
flavours
of
roughing
fighting
and
boarding
if
you
get
two
you
are
thrown
out
of
the
game
and
fined
technical
foul
bad
mouthing
the
ref
by
player
or
coach
penalty
shot
is
awarded
two
and
you
are
thrown
out
of
the
game
besides
the
penalty
shot
for
one
technical
if
the
team
gets
penalties
in
a
period
the
opposing
team
gets
a
penalty
shot
for
every
additional
one
until
the
end
of
the
period
the
victim
gets
two
shots
if
heshe
was
in
the
act
of
shooting
when
the
foul
ocured
these
new
rule
changes
are
great
however
i
think
that
your
rules
are
much
too
complicated
how
will
the
normal
average
fan
be
able
to
count
how
many
fouls
a
player
has
and
then
we
would
even
have
to
remember
the
names
of
the
players
in
order
to
determine
who
drew
the
foul
and
of
course
there
will
have
to
be
new
subpositions
like
the
power
center
who
just
sits
in
the
slot
until
the
blue
of
course
puck
comes
near
him
and
the
shooting
defenseman
and
the
point
defenseman
finally
well
be
able
to
keep
stats
on
the
best
and
the
worst
penaltyshot
takers
since
almost
everyone
on
the
ice
will
be
getting
fouled
well
be
able
