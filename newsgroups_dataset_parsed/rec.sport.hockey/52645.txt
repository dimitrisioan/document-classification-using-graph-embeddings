THIS
INLCLUDES
ALL
THE
CURRENT
FLAVOURS
OF

THESE
NEW
RULE
CHANGES
ARE
GREAT
HOWEVER
I
THINK
THAT
YOUR
RULES
ARE
MUCH
TOO
COMPLICATED
HOW
WILL
THE
NORMAL
AVERAGE
FAN
BE
ABLE
TO
COUNT
HOW
MANY
FOULS
A

HAS
AND
THEN
WE
WOULD
EVEN
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
PLAYERS
IN
ORDER
TO
DETERMINE
WHO
DREW
THE
FOUL
AND
OF
COURSE
THERE
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
NEW
SUBPOSITIONS
LIKE
THE
POWER

WHO
JUST
SITS
IN
THE

UNTIL
THE
