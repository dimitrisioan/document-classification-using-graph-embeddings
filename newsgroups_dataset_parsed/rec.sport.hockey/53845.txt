PROBERT
AND
WENDALL
GAME
TWO
OF
THE
DETROIT
TORONTO
SERIES
WILL
BE
A
ROUGHER
GAME
I
BELIEVE
THAT
CLARK
WILL
BE
COMING
OUT
HITTING
ON
ALL
CYLINDARS
I
BELIEVE
THAT
PROBERT
WILL
TAKE
EXCEPTION
TO
THIS
AND
A
FIGHT
BETWEEN
CLARK
AND
PROBERT
WILL
RESULT
I
KNOW
THIS
SOUNDS
KIND
OF
RIDICULOUS
BUT
I
KNOW
GAME
TWO
TORONTO
WILL
COME
OUT
HITTING
ANY
TAKERS
ON
THIS
ISSUE
