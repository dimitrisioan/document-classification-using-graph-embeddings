R
P
BURKE
WRITES
WHEN
TALKING
ABOUT
HOCKEY
BROADCASTERS
LETS
GIVE
A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
TO
REMEMBER
THE
ST
LOUIS
BLUES
GREAT
DAN
KELLY
MANY
OF
YOU
MAY
HAVE
HEARD
HIM
IN
THE
LATE
AND
EARLY
ON
CBS
HE
USED
TO
DO
HOCKEY
NIGHT
IN
CANADA
INTERMISSIONS
WITH
ANOTHER
RECENTLY
DECEASED
GREAT
DANNY
GALLIVAN
OF
THE
CANADIENS
I
LOVED
DAN
KELLY
HE
WAS
ON
USA
WHEN
I
FIRST
GOT
HOOKED
ON
HOCKEY
BACK
IN
OR
SO
NO
HE
WASNT
ALWAYS
SPOT
ON
TOP
OF
THE
PLAY
AND
HE
WASNT
OVERLY
CUTE
BUT
THOSE
PIPES
THAT
LUSTY
BARREL
CHESTED
VOICE
NO
PIPSQUEAK
WAS
HE
UNLIKE
SOME
FELLAS
WE
KNOW
I
RODE
INTO
HOCKEY
MANIA
ON
THE
COATTAILS
OF
GRETZKY
AND
THE
BOYS
ON
THE
BUS
MY
FIRST
FINALS
SAW
THE
ISLANDERS
SWEEP
THEM
BUT
ILL
NEVER
FORGET
THE
NIGHT
A
YEAR
LATER
WHEN
THE
OILERS
CLOSED
IT
OUT
AT
HOME
IN
THE
PANDEMONIUM
THE
SMOKE
FROM
A
MILLION
SPARKLERS
THE
LONG
EMPTYNET
GOAL
NEAR
THE
END
AND
DAN
KELLY
LETTING
THE
CROWDS
REACTION
TELL
THE
STORY
FOR
A
FEW
LONG
SECONDS
THEN
THAT
VOICE
BARKING
THROUGH
THE
DIN
DAVE
LUMLEY
SEWS
IT
UP
FOR
EDMONTON
IT
SOUNDS
STUPID
BUT
THAT
EARLY
FOR
ME
HOCKEY
MEMORY
WILL
ALWAYS
BRING
A
THRILL
SINCE
THEN
IVE
GROWN
A
LOT
MORE
JADED
ABOUT
THE
GAME
BUT
I
WAS
REALLY
SADDENED
BY
DAN
KELLYS
PASSING
HE
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
GOOD
GUYS
