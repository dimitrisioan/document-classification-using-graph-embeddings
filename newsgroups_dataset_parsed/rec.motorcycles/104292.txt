I
WAS
ATTACKED
BY
A
RABID
HUBCAP
ONCE
I
WAS
GOING
TO
WORK
ON
A
YAMAHA
TWIN
AKA
THE
VIBRATING
TANK
WHEN
I
HEARD
A
WIERD
NOISE
OFF
TO
MY
LEFT
I
CAUGHT
A
GLIMPSE
OF
SOMETHING
SILVER
HEADED
FOR
MY
LEFT
FOOT
AND
JERKED
IT
UP
ABOUT
A
NANOSECOND
BEFORE
MY
BIKE
WAS
HIT
HARD
IN
THE
LEFT
SIDE
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
PUT
MY
FOOT
BACK
ON
THE
PEG
I
FOUND
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
THERE
I
PULLED
INTO
THE
NEAREST
PARKING
LOT
AND
DISCOVERED
THAT
I
HAD
BEEN
HIT
BY
A
WIREWHEEL
TYPE
HUBCAP
FROM
A
LARGE
CAGE
THIS
HUBCAP
WEIGHED
ABOUT
POUNDS
THE
IMPACT
HAD
BENT
THE
LEFT
PEG
FLAT
AGAINST
THE
FRAME
AND
TWEEKED
THE
SHIFTER
IN
THE
PROCESS
HAD
I
NOT
HEARD
THE
APPROACHING
CAP
I
FEEL
CERTIAN
THAT
I
WOULD
BE
SANS
A
PORTION
OF
MY
LEFT
FOOT
ANYONE
ELSE
HAD
THIS
SORT
OF
EXPERIENCE
NOT
WITH
A
HUB
CAP
BUT
ONE
OF
THOSE
LUMBER
YARD
DELIVERY
TRUCKS
MADE
LIFE
INTERESTING
WHEN
HE
HIT
A
DIP
IN
THE
ROAD
AND
SEVERAL
SHEETS
OF
SHEETROCK
AND
A
DOZEN
GALLON
CANS
OF
SPACKLE
CAME
OFF
AT
MPH
IT
GOT
REAL
INTERESTING
FOR
ABOUT
SECONDS
OR
SO
HAD
TO
USE
A
WOOD
MALLET
TO
GET
ALL
THE
DRIED
SPACKLE
OFF
ME
THE
HELMET
AND
THE
BIKE
WHEN
I
GOT
