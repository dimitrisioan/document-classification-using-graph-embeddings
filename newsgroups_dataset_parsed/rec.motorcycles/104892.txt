CHRIS
STEINBRONER
WRITES
SORRY
HAD
TO
TAKE
OUT
TXMOTORCYCLES
BECAUSE
MY
NEWS
SERVER
REJECTED
IT
HESH
BOB
PASKER
RBPNETCOMCOM
WROTE
IT
WOULD
BE
A
SHAME
TO
SPLIT
BOXER
RIDERS
BETWEEN
DIFFERENT
LISTS
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
THE
EXISTING
LIST
FAILED
TO
MEET
THE
READERS
NEEDS
YOU
PRESUMED
YOU
NEEDED
TO
SPLIT
OUT
A
GS
LIST
BY
IMPLICATION
OF
YOUR
SPLIT
A
PLAIN
OL
BMW
LIST
WOULDNT
MEET
THE
GS
RIDERS
NEEDS
GOOD
POINT
THE
LIST
ACTUALLY
STARTED
OUT
AS
AN
EXTENSION
OF
MY
GS
V
FJ
SHOOTOUT
LIST
WHICH
IS
WHY
IT
GOT
THAT
NAME
SINCE
INCEPTION
HOWEVER
OTHER
BOXERINTERESTED
FOLKS
HAVE
JOINED
AND
THE
CONVERSATION
HAS
NOT
ALWAYS
BEEN
GEARED
TO
GSPDSTSPECIFIC
TOPICS
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
NOT
FORCING
THE
SPLIT
ISSUE
HOW
ABOUT
CHANGING
THE
CHARTER
AND
RENAMING
YOUR
LIST
FROM
BMWGS
TO
JUST
BMW
WOULD
THAT
MAKE
EVERYBODY
HAPPY
WHEN
I
RAISED
THE
TO
EXPAND
OR
NOT
TO
EXPANDTHAT
IS
THE
QUESTION
QUESTION
ON
THE
LIST
ITSELF
THERE
WERE
MIXED
FEELINGS
THE
LIST
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
OPEN
TO
ANYONE
WITH
A
NONBOUNCING
FROM
LINE
AND
THERE
HAS
BEEN
GENERAL
AGREEMENT
THAT
ONLY
BOXERRELATED
STUFF
IS
APPROPRIATE
ALMOST
ALL
OF
THE
SUBSCRIBERS
OWN
GSSTPD
BIKES
ALTHOUGH
SOME
R
RT
AND
RS
OWNERS
ARE
ALSO
ON
IT
AT
THIS
POINT
MY
MAIN
INTEREST
FOR
THE
LIST
IS
TO
PRESERVE
THE
PEACE
AND
COMRADERIE
WHILE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
PROVIDING
AS
WIDE
ACCESS
AS
POSSIBLE
THE
LIST
IS
FAIRLY
TECHNICAL
WITH
HOW
DO
I
DO
THIS
WHAT
KIND
OF
THAT
SHOULD
I
GET
KINDS
OF
QUESTIONS
THERE
HAS
YET
TO
BE
ANY
NONBMW
BASHING
K
BIKE
BASHING
OR
ANY
BMW
MFGD
AFTER
IS
A
PIECE
OF
SHIT
BASHING
SUCH
POSTS
ARE
BY
CONSENT
OF
THE
GOVERNED
PROSCRIBED
IF
THE
SIMPLE
NAME
CHANGE
WOULD
MAKE
A
SIGNIFICANT
DIFFERENCE
TO
THE
NETBOXEROWNERS
THEN
I
AM
NOT
GOING
TO
STAND
IN
THE
WAY
OF
PROGRESS
SO
HESH
LET
ME
TURN
THE
QUESTION
AROUND
HAVE
YOU
OR
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
NOT
JOINED
THE
LIST
BECAUSE
YOU
FELT
YOUR
BOXER
WAS
EXCLUDED
