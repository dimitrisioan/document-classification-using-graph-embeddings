ANOTHER
TO
THE
LIST
BUT
WITH
THIS
ONE
I
FELT
THE
MOST
HELPLESS
I
AM
SITTING
AT
A
LIGHT
ABOUT
CAR
LENGTHS
BEHIND
A
CAR
A
WISE
DECSION
SUDDENLY
I
HEAR
SCREECHING
TIRES
I
DART
MY
EYES
TO
MY
MIRRORS
AND
REALIZE
ITS
THE
MOROON
FLYING
UP
RIGHT
BEHIND
ME
IN
MY
PANIC
I
POP
MY
CLUTCH
AND
STALL
THE
BIKE
LUCKILY
THE
GUY
STOPS
A
FOOT
BEHIND
MY
REAR
WHEEL
I
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
THEORETICALLY
STOP
SO
FAR
BEHIND
A
CAR
BUT
CAN
YOU
REALLY
IN
ACTUALITY
AVOID
SUCH
AN
INCIDENT
SUGGESTIONS
ANOTHER
TIP
IS
TO
MAKE
SURE
YOU
KEEP
WELL
TO
ONE
SIDE
OF
THE
LANE
THIS
GIVES
YOU
A
QUICKER
ESCAPE
