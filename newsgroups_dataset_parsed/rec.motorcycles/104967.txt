another
to
the
list
but
with
this
one
i
felt
the
most
helpless
i
am
sitting
at
a
light
about
car
lengths
behind
a
car
a
wise
decsion
suddenly
i
hear
screeching
tires
i
dart
my
eyes
to
my
mirrors
and
realize
its
the
moroon
flying
up
right
behind
me
in
my
panic
i
pop
my
clutch
and
stall
the
bike
luckily
the
guy
stops
a
foot
behind
my
rear
wheel
i
understand
why
you
theoretically
stop
so
far
behind
a
car
but
can
you
really
in
actuality
avoid
such
an
incident
suggestions
another
tip
is
to
make
sure
you
keep
well
to
one
side
of
the
lane
this
gives
you
a
quicker
escape
route
