riding
to
work
last
week
via
hwy
from
suisun
to
i
was
pulled
over
by
a
chp
black
and
white
by
the
gas
station
by
jameson
canyon
road
the
officer
stated
it
looked
like
you
were
going
kinda
fast
coming
down
highway
you
must
have
been
going
at
least
or
i
just
said
okay
and
did
not
agree
or
disagree
to
anything
he
said
can
you
beat
this
ticket
personally
i
think
its
your
duty
as
a
citizen
to
make
it
as
much
trouble
as
possible
for
them
so
maybe
theyll
give
up
and
leave
us
alone
someday
soon
the
cop
was
certainly
within
his
legal
rights
to
nail
you
by
guessing
your
speed
mr
brown
the
author
of
fight
your
ticket
mentions
an
oakland
judge
who
convicted
a
speeder
on
the
officers
testimony
that
the
drivers
car
sounded
like
it
was
being
driven
at
an
excessive
speed
you
can
pay
off
the
state
and
your
insurance
company
or
you
can
take
it
to
court
and
be
creative
personally
ive
never
won
that
way
or
seen
anyone
win
but
the
judge
always
listens
politely
and
i
havent
seen
that
many
attempts
you
could
try
the
argument
that
since
bikes
are
shorter
than
the
cars
whose
speed
the
nice
officer
is
accustomed
to
guessing
they
therefore
appear
to
be
further
away
and
so
their
speed
appears
to
be
greater
than
it
actually
is
i
left
out
a
step
or
two
but
you
get
the
idea
if
you
can
make
it
convincing
theoretically
youre
supposed
to
win
ive
never
tried
proving
the
cop
was
mistaken
i
did
get
to
see
some
other
poor
biker
try
it
he
was
mixing
up
various
facts
like
the
maximum
acceleration
of
a
cop
car
and
the
distance
at
which
the
cop
had
been
pacing
him
and
end
up
demonstrating
that
he
couldnt
possibly
have
been
going
as
fast
as
the
cop
had
suggested
hed
brought
diagrams
and
a
calculator
he
was
prepared
he
lost
keep
in
mind
cops
do
this
all
the
time
and
their
word
is
better
than
yours
maybe
though
they
dont
guess
how
fast
bikes
are
going
all
the
time
besides
this
guy
didnt
speak
english
very
well
and
ended
up
absolutely
confounding
the
judge
the
cop
and
everyone
else
in
the
room
whod
been
recently
criminalized
by
some
twit
with
a
gun
and
a
quota
ahem
ok
im
better
now
maybe
hed
have
won
had
his
presentation
been
more
polished
maybe
not
he
did
get
applause
