HEY
HOWS
IT
GOING
NICE
TO
MEET
YOU
ON
THE
ROAD
HAVE
A
GOOD
RIDE

KEEPS
YOU
IN
THE
HABIT
OF
WATCHING
REALLY
CAREFULLY
FOR
BIKES
WHEN
YOURE
IN
A
CAGE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
THING
HAS
ANYONE
WHILE
DRIVING
A
CAGE
EVER
WAVED
AT
BIKERS

GET
THE
URGE

NEVER
ACTUALLY
DONE
IT
IVE
HAD
PEOPLE
IN
CAGES

ALWAYS
RETURN
THE
WAVE
OR

NEVER
HAPPENED
TO
ME

STARTED
RIDING

DO
WITH
IT

TRY
WAVING
