at
other
bikers

just
hey
hows
it
going
nice
to
meet
you
on
the
road
have
a
good
ride
if
youre
watching
for
other
bikes
to
wave
to
it
means
your
attention
is
on
the
road
where
it
should
be
and
youre
more
likely
to
see
cages
it
keeps
you
in
the
habit
of
watching
really
carefully
for
bikes
when
youre
in
a
cage
this
is
a
good
thing

im
in
my
cage

rolled
up
window

an
effort
to
wave
at
a
passing
biker
