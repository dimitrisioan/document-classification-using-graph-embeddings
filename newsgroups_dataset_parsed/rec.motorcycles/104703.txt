hi
im
now
in
the
market
for
buying
a
bmwthe
ideal
would
be
an
rs
but
id
be
interested
to
here
of
any
for
sale
age
is
not
a
problem
im
more
interested
in
a
good
example
without
a
massive
amount
of
miles
and
one
which
has
been
well
maintained
as
i
intend
to
keep
it
well
and
for
some
time
i
would
also
like
to
know
if
anyone
has
any
sound
advice
as

my
best
advice
would
be
to
contact
a
local
dealer
see
the
yellow
pages
under
motorcycle
dealers
and
ask
for
the
address
of
the
local
section
bmw
owners
club
the
local
bmw
dealer
will
give
you
details
of
the
bmw
insurance
terms
and
the
club
will
help
you
with
all
details
getting
a
bike
from
the
dealer
is
the
best
bet
if
you
can
afford
it
the
warranty
is
fairly
handy
as
bm
bits
are
made
from
solid
gold
apart
from
the
parts
made
from
ruby
and
platinum
