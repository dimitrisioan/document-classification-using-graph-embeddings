i
am
selling
my
trusty
husky
hopefully
to
buy
a
husaberg
this
is
a
very
good
dirt
bike
and
has
been
maintained
perfectly
i
never
had
any
problems
with
it
its
a
four
stroke
valves
liquid
cooled
engine
it
is
heavier
than
a
stroke
but
still
lighter
than
a
honda
and
has
a
lot
better
suspension
ohlins
shock
husky
fork
than
the
xr
for
the
casual
or
non
competitive
rider
the
engine
is
much
better
than
any
two
stroke
you
can
easily
lug
up
hills
and
blast
through
trails
with
minimum
gear
changes
the
ignition
and
the
carefully
tuned
carburation
makes
this
bike
very
easy
to
start
starts
of
first
kick
when
cold
or
hot
there
is
a
custom
made
carbonkevlar
light
pound
wrap
around
skid
plate
to
protect
the
engine
cases
and
the
water
pump
the
steering
angle
has
been
reduced
by
degree
to
increase
steering
quickness
this
with
the
suspension
tuneup
by
phil
douglas
of
aftershock
multiple
time
isde
rider
gives
it
a
better
ride
than
most
bike
plush
suspension
responsive
steering
with
no
head
shake
so
if
it
is
such
a
good
bike
why
sell
it
gee
i
want
to
buy
a
husaberg
which
just
a
husky
but
pounds
lighter
and
a
tad
more
