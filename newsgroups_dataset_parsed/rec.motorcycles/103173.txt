re
cultural
enquiries
more
like
those
who
use
their
backs
instead
of
their
minds
to
make
their
living
who
are
usually
ignorant
and
intolerant
of
anything
outside
of
their
group
or
level
of
understanding
there
seems
to
be
some
confusion
between
rednecks
and
white
trash
the
confusion
is
understandable
as
there
is
substantial
overlap
between
the
two
sets
let
me
see
if
i
can
clarify
rednecks
primarily
use
their
backs
instead
of
their
minds
to
make
a
living
usually
somewhat
ignorant
by
somebodys
standards
anyway
because
they
have
never
held
education
above
basic
readingwritingmath
skills
to
be
that
important
to
their
eventual
vocation
note
i
did
not
say
stupid
just
ignorant
they
might
be
stupid
but
then
so
are
some
high
percentage
of
any
group
white
trash
white
trash
fit
the
stereotype
referred
to
by
the
word
nigger
better
than
any
black
person
i
ever
met
only
with
the
added
bonus
that
white
trash
are
mean
as
hell
my
father
genuinely
lazy
not
just
out
of
work
or
under
qualified
goodfornothing
dishonest
white
people
who
are
mean
as
snakes
the
squeal
like
a
pig
boys
in
deliverance
may
or
may
not
have
been
rednecks
but
they
were
sure
as
hell
white
trash
white
trash
are
assuredly
intolerant
of
anything
outside
of
their

or

not
