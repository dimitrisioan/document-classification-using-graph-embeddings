eating
and
riding
was
re
drinking
and
riding
whats
the
feeling
about
eating
and
riding
i
went
out
riding
this
weekend
and
got
a
little
carried
away
with
some
pecan
pie
the
whole
ride
back
i
felt
sluggish
i
was
certainly
much
more
alert
on
the
ride
in
im
sure
others
have
the
same
feeling
but
the
strangest
thing
is
that
eating
is
usually
the
turnaround
point
of
weekend
rides
from
now
on
a
little
snack
will
do
id
much
rather
have
a
get
that
fullsluggish
feeling
closer
to
home
