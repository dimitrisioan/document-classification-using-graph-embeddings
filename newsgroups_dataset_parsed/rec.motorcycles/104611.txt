MIKE
SIXSMITH
WRITES
SECONDLY
IT
IS
THE
ADHESION
OF
THE
TYRE
ON
THE
ROAD
THE
SUSPENSION
GEOMETRY
AND
THE
GROUND
CLEARANCE
OF
THE
MOTORCYCLE
WHICH
DICTATE
HOW
QUICKLY
YOU
CAN
SWERVE
TO
AVOID
OBSTACLES
AND
NOT
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
PHYSICS
BETWEEN
THE
RIDERS
EARS
ARE
YOU
SERIOUSLY
SUGGESTING
THAT
COUNTERSTEERING
KNOWLEDGE
ENABLES
YOU
TO
CORNER
FASTER
OR
MORE
COMPETENTLY
THAN
YOU
COULD
MANAGE
OTHERWISE
IF
HES
NOT
I
WILL
PUT
TWO
RIDERS
ON
IDENTICAL
MACHINES
ITS
THE
ONE
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
HES
DOING
AND
WHY
THAT
WILL
BE
FASTER
IT
MAY
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
IMPROVE
YOUR
TECHNIQUE
IF
YOU
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHAT
IT
IS
THROUGH
TRIAL
AND
ERROR
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
VERY
EFFECTIVE
METHODOLOGY
ONLY
BY
UNDERSTANDING
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
STEERING
A
MOTORCYCLE
CAN
ONE
IMPROVE
ON
THAT
TECHNIQUE
I
HOLD
THAT
THIS
APPLIES
TO
ANY
HUMAN
ENDEAVOR
THATS
ALL
IT
IS
AN
INTERESTING
BIT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
TO
CLAIM
THAT
IT
IS
ESSENTIAL
FOR
ALL
BIKERS
TO
KNOW
IT
OR
THAT
YOU
CAN
CORNER
FASTER
OR
BETTER
AS
A
RESULT
IS
ABSURD
DO
YOU
CONSIDER
AN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
PHYSICS
OF
TRACTION
ABSURD
ARE
YOU
SERIOUSLY
SUGGESTING
THAT
ONE
CAN
FORM
A
TRACTION
MANAGEMENT
POLICY
WITHOUT
UNDERSTANDING
WHAT
IT
IS
OR
WHAT
FACTORS
INCREASE
OR
DECREASE
AVAILABLE
TRACTION
BRAKING
IT
IS
HIGHLY
UNLIKELY
THAT
ANY
BIKER
IS
GOING
TO
DEVELOP
HIS
MAXIMUM
SWERVING
ABILITY
WITHOUT
ANY
KNOWLEDGE
OF
TURNING
TECHNIQUES
FOR
MOST
OF
HIS
RIDING
LIFE
THIS
MAY
NOT
BE
A
PROBLEM
BUT
IN
AN
EMERGENCY
SITUATION
IT
IS
VERY
DEFINATELY
PLACING
HIM
AT
A
DISADVANTAGE
BUT
BY
INCLUDING
COUNTERSTEERING
THEORY
IN
NEWBIE
COURSES
WE
ARE
CONFUSING
PEOPLE
UNNECESSARILY
RIGHT
AT
THE
TIME
WHEN
THERE
ARE
FAR
MORE
IMPORTANT
MATTERS
FOR
THEM
TO
LEARN
I
DISAGREE
THE
EXISTANCE
AND
IMMENSE
SUCCESS
OF
RIDING
COURSES
WHICH
TEACH
THE
TECHNIQUE
INDICATE
THAT
THE
CONCEPT
CAN
BE
TAUGHT
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
IS
NEITHER
CONFUSING
NOR
DETRACTS
FROM
ANY
OTHER
ASPECTS
OF
THE
COURSE
AND
THAT
WAS
MY
ORIGINAL
POINT
PERHAPS
BUT
IN
THE
ENSUING
DISCUSSION
YOU
STRAYED
FAR
FROM
THAT
POINT
TO
CLAIM
THAT
KNOWLEDGE
OF
STEERING
TECHNIQUE
IS
IRRELEVANT
TO
A
RIDERS
ABILITY
I
FIND
THIS
ASSERTION
LUDICROUS
ED
GREEN
FORMER
NINJAITE
I
WAS
DRINKING
LAST
NIGHT
WITH
A
BIKER
EDGREENEASTSUNCOM
AND
I
SHOWED
HIM
A
PICTURE
OF
YOU
I
SAID
DOD
GO
ON
GET
TO
KNOW
HER
YOULL
LIKE
HER
THE
GRATEFUL
DEAD
IT
SEEMED
LIKE
THE
LEAST
I
COULD
DO
