back
in
my
youth
ahem
the
wiffy
and
moi
purchased
a
gadget
which
heated
up
water
from
a
source
it
was
for
car
use
but
we
thought
wed
try
it
on
my
it
worked
ok
apart
from
one
slight
problem
we
had
to
keep
the
revs
above
any
lower
and
the
motor
would
die
from
lack
of
electron
movement
it
made
for
interesting
cups
of
coffee
anyhow
we
would
plot
routes
that
contained
straights
of
over
three
miles
so
that
we
had
sufficient
time
to
get
the
water
to
boiling
point
this
is
sometimes
difficult
in
england
good
luck
on
your
quest
