how
to
act
in
front
of
traffic
jerks
ive
found
that
an
effective
strategy
is
to
flash
my
brake
light
by
pumping
the
pedal
you
will
obviously
need
a
bit
of
free
play
in
your
brake
pedal
to
do
this
it
seems
that
even
the
most
brain
dead
idiot
can
usually
discern
that
a
flashing
red
light
directly
in
front
of
himherit
may
mean
that
something
is
wrong
i
see
one
thing
wrong
with
your
strategy
