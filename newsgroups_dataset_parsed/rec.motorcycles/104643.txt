CAREFUL
I

DELETA
THE

IS
LIGHT
FOR
ITS
SIZE
I
THINK
ITS
POUNDS

HEAVY
FOR

IMO
THE
BIKE
SUFFERS
FROM
THE
INFAMOUS
SUZUKI

PROBLEM
I
HAVE
SO

AVOIDED
FORKING
OUT
THE

THE

SYSTEM
CONSISTENTLY
OVERCHARGES
THE

I
HAVE
TO
REFILL
IT
NEARLY
WEEKLY
THIS
IN

IS
NOT
SO
BAD
BUT
BATTERY
ACCESS
IS
GAINED
ONLY
AFTER
REMOVING
