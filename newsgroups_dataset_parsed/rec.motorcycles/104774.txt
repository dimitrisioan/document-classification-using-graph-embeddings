the
question
for
the
day
is
re
passenger
helmets
if
you
dont
know
for
certain
whos
gonna
ride
with
you
like
say
you
meet
them
at
a
church
meeting
yeah
thats
the
ticket
what
are
some
guidelines
should
i
just
pick
up
another
shoei
in
my
size
to
have
a
backup
helmet
xl
or
should
i
maybe
get
an
inexpensive
one
of
a
smaller
size
to
accomodate
my
likely
passenger
if
your
primary
concern
is
protecting
the
passenger
in
the
event
of
a
crash
have
him
or
her
fitted
for
a
helmet
that
is
their
size
if
your
primary
concern
is
complying
with
stupid
helmet
laws
carry
a
real
big
spare
you
can
put
a
big
or
small
head
in
a
big
helmet
but
not
in
a
small
one
while
shopping
for
a
passenger
helmet
i
noticed
that
in
many
cases
the
external
dimensions
of
the
helmets
were
the
same
from
s
through
xl
the
difference
was
the
amount
of
inside
padding
my
solution
was
to
buy
a
large
helmet
and
construct
a
removable
liner
from
a
sheet
of
closedcell
foam
and
some
satin
glued
to
the
inside
surface
the
result
is
a
reasonably
snug
fit
on
my
smallestheaded
pillion
with
the
liner
in
and
a
comfortable
fit
on
my
largestheaded
pillion
with
the
liner
out
everyone
else
gets
linered
or
not
by
best
fit
