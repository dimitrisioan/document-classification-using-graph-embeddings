THE
QUESTION
FOR
THE
DAY
IS
RE
PASSENGER
HELMETS
IF
YOU
DONT
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
WHOS
GONNA
RIDE
WITH
YOU
LIKE
SAY
YOU
MEET
THEM
AT
A
CHURCH
MEETING
YEAH
THATS
THE
TICKET
WHAT
ARE
SOME
GUIDELINES
SHOULD
I
JUST
PICK
UP
ANOTHER
SHOEI
IN
MY
SIZE
TO
HAVE
A
BACKUP
HELMET
XL
OR
SHOULD
I
MAYBE
GET
AN
INEXPENSIVE
ONE
OF
A
SMALLER
SIZE
TO
ACCOMODATE
MY
LIKELY
PASSENGER
IF
YOUR
PRIMARY
CONCERN
IS
PROTECTING
THE
PASSENGER
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
A
CRASH
HAVE
HIM
OR
HER
FITTED
FOR
A
HELMET
THAT
IS
THEIR
SIZE
IF
YOUR
PRIMARY
CONCERN
IS
COMPLYING
WITH
STUPID
HELMET
LAWS
CARRY
A
REAL
BIG
SPARE
YOU
CAN
PUT
A
BIG
OR
SMALL
HEAD
IN
A
BIG
HELMET
BUT
NOT
IN
A
SMALL
ONE
WHILE
SHOPPING
FOR
A
PASSENGER
HELMET
I
NOTICED
THAT
IN
MANY
CASES
THE
EXTERNAL
DIMENSIONS
OF
THE
HELMETS
WERE
THE
SAME
FROM
S
THROUGH
XL
THE
DIFFERENCE
WAS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
INSIDE
PADDING
MY
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
BUY
A
LARGE
HELMET
AND
CONSTRUCT
A
REMOVABLE
LINER
FROM
A
SHEET
OF
CLOSEDCELL
FOAM
AND
SOME
SATIN
GLUED
TO
THE
INSIDE
SURFACE
THE
RESULT
IS
A
REASONABLY
SNUG
FIT
ON
MY
SMALLESTHEADED
PILLION
WITH
THE
LINER
IN
AND
A
COMFORTABLE
FIT
ON
MY
LARGESTHEADED
PILLION
WITH
THE
LINER
OUT
EVERYONE
ELSE
GETS
LINERED
OR
NOT
BY
BEST
FIT
