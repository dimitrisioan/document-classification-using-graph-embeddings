RE
LANE
SHARING
IN
CA
IN
THREE
YEARS
OF
RIDING
IN
THE
CITIES
OF
SAN
JOSE
SANTA
CLARA
AND
SUNNYVALE
I
NEVER
CAME
INTO
ANY
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
LOCAL
POLICE
OVER
MY
LANE
SPLITTING
HABITS
ALL
THREE
OF
THESE
CITIES
WERE
LISTED
EARLIER
AS
BEING
ANTISPLITTING
IN
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
I
CANT
SAY
WHETHER
THIS
WAS
DUE
TO
LUCK
POLICE
KINDNESS
OR
THERE
NOT
ACTUALLY
BEING
ANY
ORDINANCES
AGAINST
IT
IN
THESE
CITIES
SO
I
CONTINUE
REVCO
