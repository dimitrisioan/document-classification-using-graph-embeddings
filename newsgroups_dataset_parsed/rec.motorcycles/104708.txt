IVE
SEEN
SOLAR
BATTERY
BOOSTERS
AND
THEY
SEEM
TO
COME
WITHOUT
ANY
GUARANTEE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IVE
HEARD
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
USE
THEM
WITH
SUCCESS
ALTHOUGH
I
HAVE
YET
TO
COMMUNICATE
DIRECTLY
WITH
SUCH
A

HAVE
YOU

ROBERT

I
HAVE
A
CHEAP
SOLAR
CHARGER
THAT
I
KEEP
IN
MY
CAR
I
PURCHASED
IT
VIA
SOME
MAIL
ORDER
CATALOG
WHEN
THE
YEAR
OLD
BATTERY
IN
MY
OLDSMOBILE
WOULD
RUN
DOWN
DURING
SUMMER
WHEN
I
WAS
RIDING
MY
BIKE
MORE
THAN
DRIVING
MY
CAR
KNOWING
ID
BE
SELLING
THE
CAR
IN
A
YEAR
OR
SO
I
PURCHASED
THE
CHARGER
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
THE
THING
WORKED
THE
BATTERY
HELD
A
CHARGE
AND
ENERGETICALLY
STARTED
THE
CAR
MANY
TIMES
AFTER
OR
WEEKS
OF
JUST
SITTING
EVENTUALLY
I
HAD
TO
PURCHASE
A
NEW
BATTERY
ANYWAY
BECAUSE
THE
WINTER
SUN
WASNT
STRONG
ENOUGH
DUE
TO
ITS
LOW
ANGLE
I
THINK
I
PAID
OR
FOR
THE
CHARGER
THERE
ARE
MORE
POWERFUL
MORE
EXPENSIVE
ONES
BUT
I
PURCHASED
THE
CHEAPEST
ONE
I
COULD
FIND
IVE
NEVER
USED
IT
ON
THE
BIKE
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
AN
EZ
CHARGER
ON
IT
AND
KEEP
IT
PLUGGED
IN
ALL
THE
TIME
THE
BIKE
IS
GARAGED
