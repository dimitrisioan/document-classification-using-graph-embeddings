WATCH
OUT
OFTEN
WHEN
SOME
SCUMBAG
STEALS
THE
COVER
THAT
MEANS
THAT
THEY
WERE
OR
ARE
LOOKING
TO
STEAL
THE
BIKE
IN
MY
CASE
I
HAD
A
FADED
COVER
STOLEN
OFF
A
BMW
THAT
WAS
STASHED
IN
AN
APARTMENT
CARPORT
AND
NOT
VISIBLE
FROM
THE
STREET
THEY
EVIDENTLY
DECIDED
THE
BEEMER
WASNT
WORTH
STEALING
BUT
DID
TRY
THE
NEXT
NIGHT
TO
STEAL
A
HONDA
HURRICANE
PARKED
IN
THE
NEXT
APARTMENT
BUILDING
A
NEIGHBOR
HEARD
THEM
WHEELING
IT
OUT
AND
CALLED
THE
COPS
I
KNOW
THIS
IS
JUST
SETTING
MYSELF
UP
BUT
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
IS
REALLY
GOOD
ABOUT
BMW
BIKES
FROM
ALL
ACCOUNTS
IVE
HEARD
PRACTICALLY
NO
ONE
STEALS
BMWS
PROBABLY
IT
IS
SIMILAR
FOR
MOTO
GUZZIS
AND
OTHER
RELATIVE
EXOTICS
SINCE
THERE
ISNT
A
LARGE
DEMAND
FOR
PARTS
AND
THE
BIKE
WOULD
BE
MUCH
EASIER
TO
TRACK
DOWN
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
MOST
STOLEN
BIKES
ARE
HARLEYS
AND
JAP
SPORT
BIKES
WELL
ID
SAY
YOURE
MOSTLY
RIGHT
BUT
FOR
DIFFERENT
REASONS
BTW
AS
OF
A
COUPLE
YEARS
AGO
THE
MOST
STOLEN
BIKES
IN
ORANGE
COUNTY
AND
SF
WERE
GSXS
AND
NINJAS
PROBABLY
THE
BIGGEST
REASON
BMWS
ARENT
RIPPED
OFF
IS
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
BUY
BMWS
WILL
ONLY
DEAL
WITH
THE
ACTUAL
BMW
DEALER
OR
MAIL
ORDER
TYPES
MOST
OF
THESE
CAN
HAVE
THEIR
INVENTORY
CHECKED
FAIRLY
EASILY
BY
LAWENFORCEMENT
TYPES
AND
THEIR
MARKUP
IS
USUALLY
SUFFICIENT
TO
KEEP
THEM
HONEST
ABOUT
ACQUIRING
PARTS
FOR
HARLEYS
AND
RICEROCKETS
YOUVE
GOT
DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS
THERE
IS
A
HUGE
AFTERMARKET
IN
HARLEY
PARTS
SO
A
BIKE
CAN
BE
PARTED
OUT
FAIRLY
EASILY
DITTO
THE
NONSPORT
JAPANESE
BIKES
BUT
THE
PRICES
ON
THE
PARTS
FOR
THESE
ARE
NOT
AS
HIGH
COMPARATIVELY
FOR
THE
ROCKETS
ANYTIME
A
BIKE
GOES
DOWN
THE
PLASTIC
IS
USUALLY
CRACKED
AND
IS
EXPENSIVE
TO
REPLACE
ITS
FAIRLY
EASY
THEN
FOR
A
DISREPUTABLE
SHOP
TO
TAKE
A
FAIRING
FROM
A
STOLEN
BIKE
SLAP
IT
ON
A
BIKE
IN
FOR
REPAIR
REPAINT
IT
AND
MAKE
A
TIDY
PROFIT
THE
OTHER
PARTS
MORE
TRACEABLE
CAN
BE
USED
OR
DISCARDED
IF
THEY
ARE
TOO
TRACEABLE
