WRITES
WE
ALL
SEEM
TO
BE
IN
AGREEMENT
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
EXPLANATIONS
FOR
WHY
ONE
CAN
USE
THE
HANDLEBARS
TO
LEAN
A
MOVING
MOTORCYCLE
THE
QUESTION
IS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
EFFECT
DOMINANT
AND
WHICH
ONE
IS
IT
THE
IDEA
WOULD
BE
TO
DESIGN
AN
EXPERIMENT
WHICH
WOULD
SEAPRATE
THE
TWO
CHARACTERISTICS
AND
SEE
WHICH
EFFECT
PRODUCES
A
SIMILAR
RESULT
TO
THE
ONE
WITH
WHICH
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
HAVE
BIKES
ARE
FAMILIAR
AS
YOU
POINT
OUT
THE
EXPERIMENTS
WOULD
BE
DIFFICULT
BUT
WE
KNOW
ENOUGH
ABOUT
THE
PHYSICS
OF
THE
SITUATION
TO
DO
SOME
CALCULATIONS
THERE
ARE
IN
FACT
THREE
EFFECTS
CONTRIBUTING
TO
LEANING
THE
BIKE
OVER
TO
BEGIN
A
TURN
GYRO
EFFECT
CAUSING
A
TORQUE
WHICH
TWISTS
THE
BIKE
OVER
CONTACT
PATCH
HAVING
SHIFTED
TO
ONE
SIDE
CAUSING
BIKE
TO
FALL
OVER
CONTACT
PATCH
BEING
ACCELERATED
TO
THE
SIDE
CAUSING
A
TORQUE
WHICH
TWISTS
THE
BIKE
OVER
TAKE
AN
AVERAGE
BIKERIDER
AVERAGE
BIKE
WHEEL
AND
AT
SPEEDS
OF
AND
MPH
SAY
CALCULATE
HOW
MUCH
TWIST
OF
THE
BARS
WOULD
BE
NEEDED
TO
PRODUCE
SAY
DEGREES
OF
LEAN
IN
SAY
SECONDS
BY
EACH
EFFECT
ALONE
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
AT
SLOW
SPEEDS
IS
DOMINANT
AND
AT
HIGH
SPEEDS
IS
DOMINANT
AND
AT
ALL
SPEEDS
CONTRIBUTES
NOT
FAR
OFF
BUGGER
ALL
RELATIVELY
SPEAKING
BY
THE
WAY
A
SIMILAR
PROBLEM
IS
THIS
HOW
DOES
A
RUNNER
WHO
WANTS
TO
RUN
ROUND
A
CORNER
GET
LEANED
INTO
THE
CORNER
FAST
IS
THERE
A
RUNNING
GROUP
WHERE
WE
COULD
START
COUNTERFOOTING
ARGUMENTS
AND
HAVE
THEM
ALL
FALLING
OVER
AS
THEY
TRIED
TO
WORK
OUT
HOW
THEY
GO
