during
the
summer
yes
you
wiseguy
i
mean
while
they
are
off
are
they
comfortable
do
they
transmit
a
lot
of
vibration
how
do
they
compare
to
the
stock
grips
to
foam
grips
do
they
really
make
a
difference
during
the
winter
i
just
got
a
and
had
the
heated
grips
installed
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
grips
look
and
feel
the
same
as
the
standard
grips
they
are
not
soft
last
weekend
i
did
a
mile
roundtrip
and
got
to
a
point
where
it
was
in
the
and
raining
those
heated
grips
were
great
ive
only
had
the
bike
a
month
and
the
heated
grips
are
already
one
of
my
favorite
features
on
the
bike
