i
need
some
advice
on
having
someone
ride
pillion
with
me
on
my
ninja
this
will
be
the
the
first
time
ive
taken
anyone
for
an
extended
ride
read
farther
than
around
the
block
well
be
riding
some
twisty
fairly
bumpy
roads
the
mines
roadmthamilton
loop
for
you
sf
bay
areans
id
say
this
is
a
very
bad
idea
you
should
start
out
with
something
much
mellower
so
that
neither
one
of
you
get
in
over
your
head
that
particular
road
requires
full
concentration
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
want
to
take
a
passenger
on
for
the
first
time
once
you
both
decide
that
you
like
riding
together
and
want
to
do
something
longer
and
more
challenging
then
go
for
a
hard
core
road
like
minesmt
hamilton
in
any
case
its
your
moral
responsibility
to
make
sure
that
she
has
proper
gear
that
fits
especially
if
youre
going
sport
riding
