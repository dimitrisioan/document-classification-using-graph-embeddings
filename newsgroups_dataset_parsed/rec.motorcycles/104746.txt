RE
STARTING
TROUBLE
IN
ARTICLE
YAU
FELIX
CHUNG
WRITES
I
AM
HAVING
TROUBLE
STARTING
KEEPING
RUNNING
MY
I
HAVE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
IT
SINCE
LAST
YEAR
BUT
IT
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
SUBSIDED
NOW
ITS
BACK
AGAIN
PROBLEM
PERSISTS
REGARDLESS
OF
CHOKE
USAGE
PATTERN
GASOLINE
TYPE
BRAND
OCTANE
AND
PRETTY
MUCH
ANYTHING
ELSE
I
CAN
IMAGINE
TO
CHANGE
THE
DEALER
IS
STUMPED
ITS
STILL
UNDER
WARRANTY
I
START
THE
BIKE
IT
RUNS
GREAT
FOR
A
WHILE
SECONDS
THEN
THE
ENGINE
STARTS
TO
SLOW
DOWN
DECREASING
THE
IDLE
SETTING
WILL
INCREASE
THE
ENGINE
SPEED
INCREASING
THE
CHOKE
INCREASES
THE
ENGINE
SPEED
REGARDLESS
THE
ENGINE
WILL
EVENTUALLY
SLOW
DOWN
AND
STOP
ONCE
STOPPED
IT
WILL
NOT
RESTART
EVEN
AFTER
FLOODED
ENGINE
DRILL
IF
I
LET
IT
SIT
MINUTES
IT
STARTS
BEAUTIFULLY
AND
RUNS
GREAT
FOR
EVER
SO
I
GO
OUT
RIDE
IT
HARD
FOR
MILES
AND
BRING
IT
BACK
RIDE
IT
EASY
FOR
A
FEW
MILES
TO
LET
IT
COOL
DOWN
AND
PUT
IT
AWAY
NEXT
DAY
I
GO
THRU
THE
SAME
DRILL
TO
GET
IT
GOING
ANY
IDEAS
HAS
ANYONE
SEEN
THIS
BEFORE
ANOTHER
RIDER
HAD
SIMILIAR
PROBLEMS
AND
THIS
IS
THE
MAIL
I
SENT
HIM
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
RESOLVE
YOU
PROBLEM
AT
ALLEN
TOBIAS
WRITES
CHECK
THE
VENT
TUBE
TO
THE
TANK
SOMETIMES
THE
TUBE
IS
CLOGGED
OR
CONSTRICTED
THIS
PREVENTS
GAS
FROM
FLOWING
INTO
THE
CARBS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
VACUUM
CREATED
BY
THE
DISPLACEMENT
OF
THE
GASOLINE
THIS
IS
THE
SMALL
TUBE
ON
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
TANK
THE
LARGE
TUBE
IS
THE
OVERFLOW
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
LEFT
SIDE
TAIL
SECTION
TO
GET
ACCESS
TO
THIS
AREA
GOOD
LUCK
BUT
IF
IT
WAS
CLOGGED
WOULDNT
THIS
INTERFERE
WITH
ENGINE
OPERATION
ALL
THE
TIME
WHEN
IT
RUNS
IT
RUNS
WELL
GOOD
POINT
DID
NOT
CATCH
THIS
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
POST
THE
ONLY
OTHER
THINGS
WHICH
COME
TO
MIND
SINCE
THIS
IS
A
GRAVITY
FEED
FUEL
SYSTEM
IS
THIS
THE
FUEL
PETCOCK
VALVE
IS
VACUUM
CONTROLLED
FROM
THE
CARBURATOR
LET
SUPPOSE
THERE
IS
A
SMALL
HOLE
OR
BAD
SEAL
EITHER
IN
THE
HOSE
ITSELF
OR
THE
VACUUM
VALVE
IN
THE
FUEL
PETCOCK
WHEN
IT
IS
COLD
THE
HOLE
IS
OPEN
ENOUGH
TO
OPEN
THE
VALVE
JUST
ENOUGH
TO
ALLOW
GAS
TO
THE
CARBS
WITH
THE
CHOKE
ON
SINCE
THE
CHOKE
CREATES
MORE
LOW
PRESSURE
IN
THE
CARBS
WHEN
ON
TO
DRAW
GAS
AND
AS
THE
ENGINE
AND
SURROUNDING
AREA
WARM
UP
THE
HOLE
SEALS
UP
ONE
WAY
TO
CHECK
FUEL
FLOW
THROUGH
THE
VALVE
WOULD
BE
TO
PULL
THE
SIDE
PANELS
OFF
AND
REMOVE
THE
FUEL
HOSE
TO
THE
CARBS
CONNECT
A
TUBE
OF
THE
CORRECT
SIZE
PREFERABLY
CLEAR
TUBING
TO
OBSERVE
FUEL
FLOW
ON
THE
OUTPUT
SIDE
OF
THE
FUEL
PETCOCK
REMOVE
THE
CONTROL
HOSE
FROM
CARBURATOR
MAKE
SURE
THE
TANK
IS
FULL
PLACE
THE
VALVE
IN
THE
ON
POSITION
AND
APPLY
VACUUM
TO
THE
CONTROL
HOSE
PREFERABLY
WITH
A
VACUUM
DEVICE
WITH
A
GAUGE
TO
CHECK
FOR
AIR
LEAKS
WITH
VACUUM
APPLIED
FUEL
SHOULD
FLOW
FREELY
TO
SEE
IF
THERE
IS
A
VENT
PROBLEM
DO
THIS
WITH
THE
FUEL
FILLER
CAP
OPEN
AND
CLOSED
IF
IT
FLOWS
A
LOT
FASTER
WITH
THE
FILLER
CAP
OPEN
THEN
THERE
MAY
BE
SOMETHING
IN
THE
VENT
AIRWAY
WHICH
CHANGES
POSITION
AND
DEPENDING
ON
THE
POSITION
MAY
CLOG
OR
PARTIALLY
CLOG
THE
VENT
I
HAVE
HEARD
OF
SOME
FUEL
TANKS
BEING
REPLACED
TO
FIX
THIS
PROBLEM
SO
THE
THINGS
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
DEFECTIVE
ARE
THE
CONTROL
HOSE
FROM
CARB
THE
PETCOCK
VALVE
AND
POSSIBLY
THE
FUEL
TANK
VENT
NOW
IF
ALL
OF
THE
ABOVE
SHOWS
NO
PROBLEM
OF
FUEL
FLOW
WHEN
COLD
THEN
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
IN
THE
CARBS
SCREWED
UP
BUT
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
THINGS
TO
CHECK
I
WOULD
BE
TYPING
ALL
DAY
TO
LIST
THEM
ALL
HERE
ARE
A
FEW
WITH
EVERYTHING
BACK
TOGETHER
APPLY
VACUUM
TO
THE
PETCOCK
VALVE
AND
OPEN
THE
DRAIN
HOLES
ON
THE
CARBS
ONE
BY
ONE
TO
CHECK
FUEL
FLOW
OPEN
UP
THE
AIRBOX
AND
CHECK
FOR
FOREIGN
DEBRIS
OR
CLOGGED
AIRWAYS
ON
THE
CARBS
THERE
ARE
QUITE
A
FEW
ON
EACH
CARB
I
HOPE
SOMETHING
IS
FLUSHED
OUT
WITH
ALL
THIS
TROUBLE
SHOOTING
IF
AMERICAN
HONDA
DOES
NOT
RESOLVE
THIS
GET
MAD
AS
HELL
AND
REPORT
THEM
TO
THE
BBB
AND
CALL
THE
HONDA
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
HOTLINE
IT
IS
A
NUMBER
BUT
I
DONT
RECALL
IT
OFF
THE
TOP
OF
MY
HEAD
I
CALLED
JUST
ABOUT
TIRES
FOR
MY
AND
A
FEW
DAYS
LATER
A
CUSTOMER
SATISFACTION
INQUIRY
CARD
ARRIVED
AT
HOME
ASKING
HOW
I
LIKED
THE
SUPPORT
I
RECEIVED
HERE
WOULD
BE
YOUR
CHANCE
TO
TELL
THEM
WHAT
YOU
THINK
BUY
THE
SERVICE
MANUAL
ON
THE
IT
IS
AN
INVALUABLE
SOURCE
OF
INFORMATION
FOR
WORKING
ON
YOUR
BIKE
AND
I
MIGHT
ADD
TROUBLE
SHOOTING
