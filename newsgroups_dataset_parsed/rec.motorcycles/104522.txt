okay
doders
heres
a
goddamn
mystery
for
ya
today
i
was
turning
a
degree
corner
just
like
on
any
other
day
but
there
was
a
slight
difference
a
rough
spot
right
in
my
path
caused
the
suspension
to
compress
in
mid
corner
and
some
part
of
the
bike
hit
the
ground
with
a
very
tangible
thunk
i
pulled
over
at
first
opportunity
to
sus
out
the
damage
some
deleted
barry
manor
dod
confused
accidental
pegscraper
check
the
bottom
of
your
pipes
barry
suspect
that
is
what
may
have
hit
i
did
the
same
a
few
years
past
thought
it
was
the
peg
but
found
the
bottom
of
my
pipe
has
made
contact
showed
a
good
sized
dent
scratch
believe
youd
feel
the
suddent
change
on
your
foot
if
the
peg
had
bumped
as
for
the
piece
missing
contribute
that
to
vibration
loss
yep
the
same
thing
happened
to
me
