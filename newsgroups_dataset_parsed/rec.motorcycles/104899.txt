now
just
wait
one
cotton
picking
minute
here
dod
rule
section
paragraph
clearly
indicates
that
multiple
people
cant
lay
claim
to
a
bike
in
an
obvious
ploy
to
artificially
increase
the
size
of
their
stable
so
the
question
of
the
day
is
is
spike
owned
by
a
lady
of
true
class
and
breeding
my
definition
any
woman
who
rides
or
by
tom
the
harely
head
spike
is
owned
by
both
tom
and
i
we
went
on
the
purchase
price
and
have
split
costs
of
needed
parts
registration
etc
both
names
are
on
the
pink
slip
i
also
note
that
you
lay
no
claim
to
connie
or
ol
sport
like
i
said
obviously
a
lady
of
discriminating
taste
i
am
covered
by
insurance
to
ride
the
harley
id
give
it
a
go
if
i
could
work
the
clutch
i
can
barely
get
the
clutch
lever
to
move
using
both
hands
while
standing
next
to
the
bike
ol
sport
is
a
very
distinctive
bike
the
concours
is
favorite
of
mine
ive
pillioned
an
easy
miles
on
that
bike
in
the
last
year
unfortunately
my
feet
are
a
good
off
the
ground
once
im
on
her
no
way
i
could
take
her
for
a
ride
as
pilot
rather
than
pillion
if
i
could
fit
on
a
concours
id
buy
one
imho
the
best
sporttourer
made
im
not
too
upset
i
had
to
settle
for
the
ducati
as
my
touring
bike
though
bored
minds
