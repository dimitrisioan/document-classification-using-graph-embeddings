WRITES
ALL
OF
US
THAT
ARGUE
ABOUT
GYROSCOPES
ETC
THROUGHLY
UNDERSTAND
EDTHE
TECHNIQUE
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
MEINCLUDING
ALL
THE
ONES
WHO
THINK
THAT
THEY
COUNTERSTEER
ALL
THE
WAY
METHROUGH
A
CORNER
EDWELL
ALL
THE
WAY
THROUGH
A
DECREASINGRADIUS
CORNER
ANYWAY
MAYBE
THEY
ARE
RIDING
AROUND
AN
EVERDECREASING
CIRCLE
OF
LIES
WHICH
EVENTUALLY
LEADS
TO
THE
TRUTH
METHE
OFFICIAL
LINE
HERE
THOUGH
I
DO
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
ABOUT
IT
IS
THAT
THE
MEFRONT
BRAKE
IS
APPLIED
FIRST
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
REAR
BRAKE
THE
IDEA
BEING
METHAT
YOU
AVOID
LOCKING
UP
THE
REAR
AFTER
WEIGHT
TRANSFER
TAKES
PLACE
IF
THATS
THE
OFFICIAL
LINE
TAUGHT
IN
THOSE
RIDER
EDUCATION
CLASSES
YOU
WERE
REFERING
TO
THAT
ALSO
DONT
TEACH
COUNTERSTEERING
I
HAVE
TO
QUESTION
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
CLASSES
ME
TOO
THOUGH
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
OFFICIAL
LINE
IS
THE
ONE
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
ADHERE
TO
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
GET
A
FULL
LICENCE
THE
EXAMINERS
GUIDELINES
ARE
LAID
DOWN
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
THE
BASIC
RIDER
EDUCATION
COURSES
HAVE
NO
CHOICE
BUT
TO
FOLLOW
THEM
IT
SURPRISES
ME
THAT
NONE
OF
THE
RIDER
GROUPS
HERE
EITHER
MAG
OR
THE
BMF
MAKE
MUCH
NOISE
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
RIDING
TEST
REQUIRES
YOU
TO
RIDE
THREE
FEET
FROM
THE
KERB
ALL
THE
TIME
IN
ORDER
TO
PASS
THAT
THE
FRONT
BRAKE
MUST
BE
APPLIED
BEFORE
THE
REAR
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
KEEP
LOOKING
OVER
YOUR
SHOULDER
ALL
THE
TIME
INSTEAD
OF
JUST
WHEN
IT
IS
JUSTIFIED
THERES
PROBABLY
A
FEW
MORE
TOO
WHICH
I
CANT
THINK
OF
FOR
THE
MOMENT
IF
THE
RIDING
TEST
COULD
BE
REJIGGED
A
BIT
TO
INCLUDE
MORE
OF
THE
REALWORLD
SURVIVAL
SKILLS
AND
LESS
OF
THE
WOEFULLY
SIMPLISTIC
CRAP
THAT
IT
CONTAINS
NOW
THEN
THE
ACCIDENT
FIGURES
WOULD
IMHO
REDUCE
STILL
FURTHER
DONT
THINK
WE
SHOULD
INCLUDE
COUNTERSTEERING
KNOWLEDGE
IN
OUR
TEST
THOUGH
