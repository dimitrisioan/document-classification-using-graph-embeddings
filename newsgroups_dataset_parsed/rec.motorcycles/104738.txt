re
i
need
your
advice
im
a
new
rider
in
article
writes
the
tachometer
has
a
sticker
right
on
it
that
says
for
the
first
miles
do
not
go
over
rpms
and
for
the
next
miles
dont
go
over
referred
to
as
the
breakin
period
if
you
didnt
know
well
if
i
were
to
do
that
i
would
never
be
going
over
mph
even
in
gear
so
my
question
is
will
it
hurt
my
new
cycle
to
take
it
up
in
the
rpm
range
so
that
i
can
at
least
go
the
speed
limit
but
you
already
can
go
at
the
speed
limit
at
rpm
all
you
need
to
do
is
to
find
a
road
with
a
mph
speed
limit
this
isnt
quite
as
silly
as
it
sounds
if
you
take
a
nice
day
trip
over
back
roads
not
highways
full
of
people
trying
seriously
to
get
from
here
to
there
then
you
might
be
able
to
hold
mph
comfortably
you
could
easily
do
miles
over
three
different
weekends
you
might
even
get
to
enjoy
some
of
the
scenery
yes
i
know
this
is
probably
not
why
you
bought
a
