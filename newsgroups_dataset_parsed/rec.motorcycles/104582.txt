WRITES
DSRIDING
UP
THE
HILL
LEADING
TO
MY
DSHOUSE
I
ENCOUNTERED
A
LIVERANDWHITE
SPRINGER
SPANIEL
NO

DS
I
MUST
HAVE
MISSED
THE
ARTICLE
ON
THE
SPAGTHORPE
VIKING
WAS
DSTHAT
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
LITTLE
ILLUMINATED
DRAGONS
HEAD
ON
THE
FRONT
DSFENDER
A
STYLE
LATER
COPIED
BY
INDIAN
AND
THE
ROUND
SIDE
COVERS
NO
NOT
AT
ALL
THE
VIKING
WAS
A
TRICK
LITTLE
UNIT
MADE
WAY
BACK
WHEN
FORTIES
FIFTIES
WHEN
SPAG
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
A
GO
OF
IT
IN
RACING
THE
FIRST
ITERATION
THE
SPRINGER
WAS
A
BOXER
TWIN
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
MAX
FRIZS
FAMOUS
DESIGN
BUT
WITH
AN
OVERHEAD
POINT
CAM
SEE
BELOW
FOR
MORE
ON
THE
VALVETRAIN
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
THE
THING
HAD
NO
GROUND
CLEARANCE
WHATSOEVER
THE
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
CURVE
THE
CYLINDER
BORES
SO
THAT
THE
GROUND
CLEARANCE
WAS
SUBSTANTIALLY
INCREASED
SPRINGER
MOTOR
FRONT
VIKING
MOTOR
FRONT
THIS
IS
ROUGHLY
THE
IDEA
EXCEPT
THAT
THE
BORES
WERE
GRADUALLY
CURVED
AROUND
A
RADIUS
AS
THE
PISTONS
WERE
LOATH
TO
MAKE
A
SHARPANGLED
TURN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THEIR
STROKE
THE
ENGINE
ALSO
HAD
CURVED
CONNECTING
RODS
TO
ACCOMODATE
THE
STROKE
THE
ENGINE
STUCK
OUT
SO
FAR
BECAUSE
OF
ITS
REVOLUTIONARY
AND
STILL
UNIQUE
OVERHEAD
CAM
SYSTEM
THROUGH
THE
USE
OF
CLEVER
VALVE
TIMING
AND
AND
EXTRORDINARILY
TRICK
VALVE
LINKAGE
ONLY
A
SINGLE
CAM
LOBE
WAS
REQUIRED
TO
DRIVE
BOTH
OVERHEAD
VALVES
JUST
AS
REVOLUTIONARY
WAS
THE
HYDRAULIC
VALVE
ACTUATION
WHICH
USED
A
PRESSURIZED
STREAM
OF
OIL
TO
POWER
THE
WATERWHEEL
WHICH
KEPT
THE
LOBE
SPINNING
OVER
ONE
SIDE
EFFECT
THAT
REQUIRED
SOME
RATHER
BRUTAL
ENGINEERING
FIXES
WAS
THAT
UNTIL
THE
ENGINES
OIL
PRESSURE
CAME
UP
TO
NORMAL
THE
ENGINES
VALVE
TIMING
WOULD
BE
MORE
OR
LESS
RANDOM
RESULTING
IN
SOME
IMPRESSIVE
STARTUP
VALVE
DAMAGE
THE
SOLUTION
WAS
A
LITTLE
HAND
CRANK
THAT
PRESSURIZED
THE
CASES
BEFORE
YOU
STARTED
THE
BEAST
REMARKABLY
SIMILAR
TO
THE
SYSTEM
USED
IN
NEW
PORSCHES
TO
PRESSURIZE
THE
OIL
SYSTEM
BEFORE
THE
CAR
IS
STARTED
THE
CAGE
HOWEVER
USES
AN
ELECTRIC
OIL
PUMP
WIMPS
DESPITE
THIS
FIX
THE
ENGINE
HAD
A
NASTY
PROPENSITY
FOR
EXPLOSIVELY
FIRING
ITS
VALVES
INTO
THE
PISTONS
WHEN
A
CYLINDER
WOULD
TEMPORARILY
LOSE
A
BIT
OF
OIL
PRESSURE
IN
A
CORNER
THE
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
RUN
EVEN
HIGHER
OIL
PRESSURES
AND
CHANGE
THE
GASKETS
AND
SEALS
REGULARLY
THIS
WAS
FEASIBLE
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
A
RACING
ENGINE
WITH
JUST
A
SINGLE
OVERHEAD
LOBE
AND
NO
PUSHRODSHAFTCHAIN
TOWERS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
HYDRAULIC
SYSTEM
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
ENGINE
CAME
TO
AN
ALMOST
PERFECT
POINT
LOBE
XX
COMPLEX
LINKAGE
NOT
SHOWN
DUE
TO
VALVESTEMS
COMPLEXITY
PISTON
NOTE
THAT
THE
TIP
WAS
NOT
TRULY
VERTICAL
IT
WAS
AT
ABOUT
A
DEGREE
ANGLE
TO
THE
GROUND
AND
THIS
DRAWING
DOESNT
SHOW
THE
CURVATURE
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
NONE
IN
THE
HEAD
ITSELF
THE
BORE
CURVE
WOULD
START
ABOUT
WHERE
THE
CYLINDER
BORE
DISAPPEARS
IN
THIS
DIAGRAM
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
POINTY
HEADS
ON
TOP
OF
A
PAIR
OF
GENTLY
PUNDITS
OF
THE
DAY
EVEN
SAID
SENSUOUSLY
CURVED
CYLINDERS
WAS
MUCH
LIKE
A
PAIR
OF
FINNED
VIKING
HORNS
POKING
OUT
FROM
BENEATH
THE
GAS
TANK
THUS
THE
NAME
THE
VIK
WAS
A
MODERATELY
SUCCESSFUL
RACER
LIGHTNING
FAST
WHEN
IT
WORKED
BUT
PLAGUED
BY
PROBLEMS
RELATING
TO
ITS
REVOLUTIONARY
TECHNOLOGY
EVENTUALLY
IT
WAS
DUMPED
WHEN
SPAG
FINALLY
REALIZED
THAT
RACING
WAS
NOT
WHERE
THE
SPAGTHORPE
NAME
WOULD
BE
MADE
THE
MACHINES
WERE
RACED
FOR
ANOTHER
YEAR
OR
TWO
BY
PRIVATEERS
AND
THEIR
FATE
APPROXIMATELY
SIX
VIKINGS
WERE
MADE
PLUS
ONE
OR
POSSIBLY
TWO
SPRINGERS
CONFUSING
THE
ISSUE
IS
ONE
OLD
SPAG
STAFFER
WHO
SWEARS
UP
AND
DOWN
THAT
THIS
MACHINE
WAS
TOOLED
FOR
PRODUCTION
AND
THAT
AS
MANY
AS
TWENTY
OR
THIRTY
MACHINES
MAY
HAVE
COME
OFF
THE
LINE
HOWEVER
NO
MODERN
RECORD
OF
A
