i
am
assembling
info
for
a
film
criticism
class
final
project
man
every
time
this
thread
comes
up
i
start
jumping
up
and
down
screaming
easy
wheels
easy
wheels
but
to
date
it
seems
like
im
the
only
one
who
s
ever
seen
this
its
absolutely
hysterical
basic
plot
is
this
reporter
searching
for
a
ring
of
babysnatchers
is
blow
off
the
road
by
a
very
hot
gang
of
babe
bikers
in
leather
he
is
rescued
from
his
wrecked
car
in
the
desert
by
a
xtian
gospal
biker
band
lead
by
an
ex
vietnam
vet
with
a
steel
plate
in
his
head
that
gives
him
visions
from
time
to
time
they
soon
discover
that
the
gang
o
babes
is
kidnapping
children
to
be
raised
by
wolves
the
reasoning
behind
this
is
complex
and
they
set
out
to
stop
them
and
restore
justice
and
order
to
the
world
it
is
one
of
the
funniest
movies
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life

of
your
guns
at
once
dod
i
actually
saw
this
movie
about
three
months
ago
but
it
wasnt
called
easy
wheels
it
was
something
else
that
escapes
me
at
the
moment
but
i
did
rent
it
from
blockbuster
video
and
it
was
a
hoot
in
the
same
class
as
plan
from
outer
space
