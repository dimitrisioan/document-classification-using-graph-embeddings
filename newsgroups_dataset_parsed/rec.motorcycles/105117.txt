RE
COUNTERSTEERING
TO
KNOW
OR
NOT
TO
KNOW
WHAT
IS
THE
QUESTION
IN

MIKE

WRITES
JERRY
LOTTO
WRITES
THE
UNDERSTANDING
AND
ABILITY
TO
SWERVE
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
ABSENT
AMONG
THE
ACCIDENTINVOLVED
RIDERS
IN
THE
HURT
STUDY
THE
AVERAGE
RIDER
DOES
NOT
IDENTIFY
THAT
COUNTERSTEERING
ALONE
PROVIDES
THE
PRIMARY
INPUT
TO
EFFECT
MOTORCYCLE
LEAN
BY
THEMSELVES
EVEN
AFTER
MANY
YEARS
OF
PRACTICE
I
WOULD
AGREE
ENTIRELY
WITH
THESE
THREE
PARAGRAPHS
BUT
DID
THE
HURT
STUDY
MAKE
ANY
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
AN
ABILITY
TO
SWERVE
AND
A
FAILURE
TO
SWERVE
IN
MOST
OF
THE
ACCIDENTS
AND
NEAR
ACCIDENTS
THAT
IVE
SEEN
RIDERS
WILL
ALMOST
ALWAYS
STAND
ON
THE
BRAKES
AS
HARD
AS
THEY
DARE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
INSTINCT
TO
BRAKE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
DANGER
IS
SO
STRONG
THAT
IT
OVERRIDES
EVERYTHING
ELSE
HARD
BRAKING
AND
SWERVING
TEND
TO
BE
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
MANOUVRES
DID
HURT
DRAW
ANY
CONCLUSIONS
ON
WHICH
ONE
IS
GENERALLY
PREFERABLE
APPARENTLY
THE
INSTINCT
TO
BRAKE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
DANGER
ISNT
AS
STRONG
AS
THE
INSTINCT
TO
FREEZE
UP
AND
DO
NOTHING
IN
THE
FACE
OF
DANGER
HURT
FOUND
THAT
A
SURPRISING
NUMBER
OF
ACCIDENTINVOLVED
MOTORCYCLISTS
HADNT
USED
THEIR
BRAKES
AT
ALL
PRIOR
TO
IMPACT
I
THINK
THE
ONLY
WAY
YOULL
EVER
USE
COUNTERSTEERING
RELIABLY
AND
CORRECTLY
IN
A
CRISIS
IS
TO
MAKE
IT
THE
ONLY
CONSCIOUS
METHOD
OF
DIRECTIONAL
CONTROL
YOU
EVER
USE
AND
TO
PRACTICE
IT
CONSTANTLY
EVEN
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
NO
NEED
TO
DO
ANY
TURNING
IF
YOU
FOLLOW
ME
DOWN
A
LONG
STRAIGHT
AND
I
SEEM
TO
BE
WIGGLING
BACK
AND
FORTH
RANDOMLY
OR
SUDDENLY
WITHOUT
OBVIOUS
NEED
ITS
BECAUSE
IM
PRACTICING
COUNTERSTEERING
AND
AVOIDING
IMAGINARY
OBSTACLES
DIRECTLY
IN
MY
PATH
ALL
OF
THIS
PRACTICE
MAY
INDEED
BE
FUTILE
BUT
IF
I
HAVE
EVEN
MILLISECONDS
TO
REACT
THE
MOST
FAMILIAR
TACTIC
AVAILABLE
AND
HOPEFULLY
THE
MOST
AUTOMATIC
WILL
BE
COUNTERSTEERING
THE
SAME
LOGIC
APPLIES
TO
BRAKING
WITH
THE
FRONT
BRAKE
