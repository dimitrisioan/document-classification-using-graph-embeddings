DESCRIPTION
OF
A
PRETTY
ROWDYSOUNDING
PARTY
AND
STILL
WE
WONDER
WHY
THEY
STEREOTYPE
US
ERC
WHACHA
MEAN
WEIFIN
THEY
WHOM
EVER
THEY
ARE
WANT
TO
STEREOTYPE
ME
AS
ONE
THAT
LIKES
TO
DRINK
BEER
AND
WATCH
LOVELY
LADIES
DISPLAY
THEIR
BEAUTIFUL
BODIES
I
LIKE
THAT
STEREOTYPE
IF
YOU
WERE
REFERING
STEREOTYPE
TO
INFER
A
NEGATIVE
YOU
NOTICED
WE
DIDNT
RAPE
PILLAGE
OR
BURN
DOWN
THE
TOWN
WE
ALSO
LEFT
MUCHO
BUCKS
AS
IN
MONEY
WITH
THE
TOWN
ME
THINKS
THE
TOWN
LIKES
US
LEAST
THEY
SAID
SO
LYNN
HALL
NOS
BROS
THEY
BEIN
THEMFOLK
WHO
TEND
TO
COMPOSE
FAIR
PIECE
OF
THE
POPULATION
BEIN
THE
ONES
THAT
REGARD
BIKERS
AS
A
LOUD
IRRESPONSIBLE
IRREVERENT
REPROBATE
RABBLE
DOESNT
SOUND
LIKE
THEY
ATTENDED
THOUGH
DOES
IT
IN
FACT
IF
WE
RIDERS
NEED
FRIENDS
IT
SOUNDS
A
LOT
LIKE
WE
MIGHT
HAVE
A
WHOLE
TOWNFULL
FROM
LYNNS
DESCRIPTION
ESPECIALLY
IF
THE
SAME
CROWD
GETS
INVITED
BACK
TO
PARTY
SOME
MORE
YEAR
AFTER
YEAR
SURE
YOU
DIDNT
RAPE
AND
PILLAGE
ITS
A
RELIEF
TO
KNOW
THAT
YOU
WERE
SUCH
GENTLEMEN
BUT
BECAUSE
YOU
WERE
NOT
COMPLETELY
OUTOFHAND
YOU
JUSTIFY
YOUR
LESSER
INDESCRETIONS
SOME
PRETTY
DISTORTED
THINKING
I
SHOULD
SAY
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
ONE
OF
VERY
FEW
BENT
OUT
OF
SHAPE
OVER
THESE
LESSER
INDISCRETIONS
IF
THE
TOWNSPEOPLE
ARENT
RUFFLED
BY
THE
INDISCRETIONS
AND
THE
PARTYERS
ARENT
EITHER
MAYBE
THE
INDISCRETIONS
DONT
AMOUNT
TO
ANYTHING
MORE
THREATENING
OR
DAMAGING
THAN
HARMLESS
GOODNATURED
ROWDINESS
AMONG
CONSENTING
ADULTS
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
REALLY
BOTHERED
ME
ABOUT
THE
DESCRIPTION
WAS
THE
KNEEDEEP
EMPTY
BEER
CANS
IN
THE
STREET
BUT
MAYBE
THE
TOWN
HAD
A
PLAN
TO
DEAL
WITH
THAT
SINCE
THEY
HELPED
SET
UP
THE
PARTY
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IF
I
LIVED
THERE
AND
THE
BIKERS
PREVIOUS
VISITS
HAD
ESTABLISHED
A
RECORD
OF
MUTUAL
COOPERATION
AND
GOOD
INTENTIONS
ID
CERTAINLY
RATHER
THEY
STICK
AROUND
AND
PARTY
THAN
GO
RIDING
OFF
INTO
THE
NIGHT
IMPAIRED
AND
MAYBE
GET
HURT
OR
KILLED
OH
IM
SORRY
I
JUST
NOTICED
THAT
YOU
LEFT
MUCHO
BUCKS
AS
IN
MONEY
NEVERMIND
MY
CRITICISM
I
WAS
OUT
OF
LINE
I
FORGOT
THAT
WHEN
ONE
LEAVES
MUCHO
BUCKS
AS
IN
MONEY
THEIR
BEHAVIOR
IS
PERMISSABLE
PERHAPS
EVEN
JUSTIFIED
IF
IT
DOESNT
HURT
ANYONE
AND
ALL
THE
PARTIES
TO
THE
PARTY
BENEFIT
AND
CONSIDER
THE
ENTIRE
ACTIVITY
TO
BE
BENIGN
AND
HARMLESS
THEN
WHO
NEEDS
TO
PERMIT
OR
JUSTIFY
IT
YOU
WHY
DO
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
THAT
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
THEMFOLKS
ARE
THE
ONES
THAT
COULD
GIVE
A
WHEN
A
BIKER
GETS
KILLED
WHEN
THEIR
ELECTED
OFFICIALS
INSTITUTE
FURTHER
DRACONIAN
LEGISLATION
HELMET
LAWS
GUN
CONTROLS
ETC
THE
ONES
THAT
DONT
RESPECT
OUR
RIGHTS
ON
THE
ROADS
BECAUSE
WE
DO
NOT
RESPECT
THEIRS
ALL
THE
REST
OF
THE
TIME
IRONICALLY
THESE
PARTICULAR
TOWNSFOLK
PROBABLY
ARE
IN
THE
MINORITY
THAT
DONT
HAPPEN
TO
FIT
THE
STEREOTYPE
YOU
DESCRIBE
THEYVE
DEVELOPED
A
FRIENDLY
LONGTERM
MUTUALLYBENEFICIAL
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
A
GROUP
OF
MOTORCYCLISTS
AND
ARENT
AS
BURDENED
WITH
MCIGNORANCE
AS
IS
THE
GENERAL
POPULATION
BECAUSE
OF
IT
NEED
I
CONTINUE
IF
SUCH
A
NEED
EXISTS
IT
SURELY
MUST
COME
FROM
WITHIN
SO
CONTINUE
TO
WEAR
YOUR
STIGMA
AS
A
BADGE
BUT
THE
NEXT
TIME
YOU
ARE
WHINING
ABOUT
THEM
AND
THE
EFFECT
OF
THEIR
VALUES
ON
YOURS
REMEMBER
THAT
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
THE
BEHAVIOR
OF
SELFRIGHTEOUS
WUSSES
LIKE
MYSELF
THAT
KEPT
THEM
AT
BAY
FOR
THIS
LONG
WELL
YOU
GOT
THE
SELFRIGHTEOUS
WUSSES
PART
RIGHT
ANYWAY
CHUCK
ROGERS
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
HEARD
I
RUN
WITH
A
DANGEROUS
CROWD
WE
AINT
TOO
PRETTY
WE
AINT
TOO
PROUD
WE
MIGHT
BE
LAUGHIN
A
BIT
TOO
LOUD
AH
BUT
THAT
NEVER
HURT
NO
ONE
YOU
KNOW
THAT
ONLY
THE
GOOD
DIE
YOUNG
