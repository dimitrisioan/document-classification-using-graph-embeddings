ANOTHER
GOOD
PLACE
FOR
YOUR
HELMET
IS
YOUR
MIRROR
I
KID
YOU
NOT
IF
YOU
OWN
A
TYPICAL
STANDARD
OR
OTHER
BIKE
WITH
FAIRLY
AVERAGE
MIRRORS
THAT
SCREW
INTO
YOUR
HANDLEBARS
YOUR
HELMET
SHOULD
FIT
OVER
YOUR
MIRROR
AND
BE
FAIRLY
STABLE
BE
CAREFUL
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
WEIGHT
OF
THE
HELMET
RESTING
ON
THE
MIRROR
IT
WILL
DEPRESS
THE
FOAM
LINER
IN
THE
HELMET
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
KIND
OF
FOAM
THAT
BOUNCES
BACK
LIKE
FOAM
RUBBER
ITS
PURPOSE
IN
LIFE
IS
TO
ABSORB
ENERGY
IN
AN
IMPACT
AS
IT
IS
COMPRESSED
BY
YOUR
NOGGIN
IF
YOUR
MIRROR
COMPRESSES
IT
THERE
IS
THAT
MUCH
LESS
ENERGY
ABSORBING
CAPACITY
LEFT
TO
CUSHON
YOUR
NOGGIN
IN
A
CRASH
I
FOUND
THE
RIGHT
HANDLEBAR
TO
BE
A
GOOD
SPOT
IF
ON
THE
SIDESTAND
HANG
WITH
THE
CHINBAR
FACING
UP
BALANCED
ACROSS
THE
GRIP
AND
BRAKE
LEVER
SUCH
THAT
THE
WEIGHT
OF
THE
HELMET
DOESNT
COMPRESS
ANY
OF
THE
CHINBAR
FOAM
THIS
IS
MORE
CHALLANGING

OPEN

HELMET

I
WAS
DRINKING
LAST
NIGHT
WITH
A
BIKER
EDGREENEASTSUNCOM
AND
I
SHOWED
HIM
A
PICTURE
OF
YOU
I
SAID
DOD
GO
ON
GET
TO
KNOW
HER
YOULL
LIKE
HER
THE
GRATEFUL
DEAD
IT
SEEMED
