RE
ITS
STILL
COLD
BUT
ONE
THING
IS
CERTAIN
THOUGH
ITS
STILL
TOO
COLD
AFTER
ABOUT
MINUTES
I
HAD
TO
STOP
AND
HOLD
MY
MUFFLER
FOR
A
WHILE
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
ABOUT
THIS
IF
YOURE
REALLY
COLD
THE
MUFFLER
WILL
FEEL
FINE
TILL
YOU
LEAVE
ALL
THE
CHARRED
SKIN
ON
IT
WHEN
YOU
PEEL
YOUR
HANDS
OFF
I
SPEAK
FROM
EXPERIENCE
YOU
CAN
ALSO
DO
ALL
KINDSA
AMERICANISM
OF
THE
DAY
DAMAGE
TO
YOUR
CIRCULATION
WARMING
HANDS
UP
ON
SOMETHING
TOO
HOT
BY
FAR
THE
BEST
FASTEST
AND
SAFEST
WAY
TO
DO
IT
IS
TO
SHOVE
THE
HANDS
UP
THE
OPPOSIT
SLEEVES
AND
STAND
THERE
LIKE
A
MING
EMPORER
FOR
A
WHILE
FIVE
MINUTES
SHOULD
DO
IT
