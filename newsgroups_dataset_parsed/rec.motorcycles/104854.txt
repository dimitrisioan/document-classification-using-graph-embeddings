YES
EVEN
WHEN
STEERING
NO
HANDS
YOU
DO
SOMETHING
QUITE
SIMILAR
TO
COUNTERSTEERING
BASICALLY
TO
TURN
LEFT
YOU
TO
A
QUICK
WIGGLE
OF
THE
BIKE
TO
THE
RIGHT
FIRST
CAUSING
A
COUNTERACTING
LEAN
TO
OCCUR
TO
THE
LEFT
THIS
SOUNDS
SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE
BLACK
MAGIC
TO
ME
IF
BY
QUICK
WIGGLE
TO
THE
RIGHT
YOU
MEAN
THAT
THE
HANDLEBARS
TURN
TOWARD
THE
RIGHT
BEFORE
TURNING
TO
THE
LEFT
WHAT
IS
THE
INPUT
TO
THE
STEERING
MECHANISM
THAT
MAKES
THIS
HAPPEN
IN
THE
ABSENCE
OF
THE
OLD
SHOVESHOVE
WELL
AS
MANY
A
BORED
BIKE
TOURER
CAN
TELL
YOU
THE
WAY
TO
STEER
SANS
HANS
IS
TO
PUSH
YOUR
BODY
OFF
TO
THE
SIDE
YOU
WANT
TO
LEAN
SAY
YOU
WANT
TO
TURN
LEFT
YOU
PUSH
YOUR
BODY
OFF
TO
THE
LEFT
TO
DO
THIS
YOU
HAVE
TO
PUSH
AGAINST
SOMETHING
AND
THE
ONLY
THING
TO
PUSH
AGAINST
IS
THE
GROUND
THROUGH
THE
BIKE
WELL
THE
APPLE
GUY
WOZNIAK
OR
WAS
THAT
CHURCHILL
SAYS
THAT
THE
GROUND
WILL
PUSH
YOU
RIGHT
BACK
SO
YOU
PUSHED
YOURSELF
OFF
TO
THE
LEFT
BY
PUSHING
ON
THE
GROUND
TO
THE
RIGHT
AND
THE
GROUND
PUSHED
BACK
TOWARD
THE
LEFT
WELL
THAT
PUSH
IS
ON
BOTH
WHEELS
THE
REAR
WHEEL
DOESNT
CARE
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
SERIOUS
BEARING
PROBLEMS

OF
