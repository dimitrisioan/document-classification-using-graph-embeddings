i
owned
a
bieffe
offroad
helmet
took
what
i
would
consider
a
minor
fall
and
had
visible
damage
to
the
shell
yes
the
helmet
did
its
job
but
the
damageimpact
ratio
was
scary
i
own
bell
now
have
taken
impacts
on
order
of
twice
the
bieffe
impact
we
do
this
frequently
in
mx
and
dont
even
have
a
scratch
on
it
after
two
seasons
my
recommendation
is
to
buy
high
quality
gear
ymmv
when
your
helmetted
nogin
hits
an
immoveabe
object
there
are
only
four
things
to
dissipate
the
energy
the
immoveable
object
the
helmet
shell
the
helmet
liner
the
riders
head
the
riders
ego
ok
five
assuming
that
the
helmet
head
assembly
takes
the
same
impact
if
the
shell
cracks
in
one
case
then
in
the
other
the
liner
must
be
dented
or
the
head
gets
jiggled
if
its
the
the
liner
thats
dented
the
helmet
is
just
as
toast
as
if
the
shell
were
cracked
it
wont
absorb
energy
form
an
impact
in
that
area
if
its
the
head
thats
getting
jiggled
maybe
the
new
gear
isnt
of
as
high
quality
after
all
ive
bike
like
