DOGS
CHARLES
PARR

WROTE
OH
BULL
PUCKY
ED
THEY
USE
DOGS
BECAUSE
A
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
SCARED
SHITLESS
OF
THEM
AND
B
BECAUSE
OF
THE
NOSE
AND
THE
VISION
AND
HEARING
WITHOUT
THEIR
COP
PARTNER
IN
ATTENDANCE
THE
DOG
IS
SO
MUCH
MEAT
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
ANY
HUMAN
WITH
A
BAD
ATTITUDE
AND
AL
ITTLE
TRAINING
IN
VIOLENT
FORCE
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
THAT
POLICE
DOGS
ARE
USED
FOR
IS
TO
TAKE
THE
BULLET
INSTEAD
OF
THE
HUMAN
POLICE
OFFICER
AS
CHARLES
SAID
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
SCARED
OF
DOGS
AND
WILL
PANIC
WHEN
ONE
GOES
ON
ATTACK
THEY
WILL
THEN
TURN
THEIR
WEAPON
ON
THE
DOG
AND
THIS
ALLOWS
THE
POLICE
OFFICER
TO
TAKE
CONTROL
YOUR
ADVICE
IS
CORRECT
BUT
A
DOG
IS
STILL
NO
MATCH
FOR
A
TRAINED
HUMAN
IN
A
FIGHT
A
SINGLE
PERSON
VS
A
SINGLE
DOG
IN
A
FACETOFACE
CONFRONTATION
SHOULD
REALLY
BE
NO
CONTEST
THE
DOG
IS
NO
MATCH
FOR
A
HUMAN
WILLING
TO
FIGHT
MULTIPLE
DOGS
IS
A
DIFFERENT
