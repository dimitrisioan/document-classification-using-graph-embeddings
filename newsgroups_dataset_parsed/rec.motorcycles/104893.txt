i
have
a
large
ol
farting
dog
and
have
made
a
real
effort
at
trying
to
train
him
but
he
still
just
flatulates
at
will
dont
feed
it
so
much
seriously
first
i
would
like
to
break
him
of
this
and
then
ill
worry
about
his
chasing
things
if
you
cant
youve
obviously
waited
too
long
or
are
not
putting
much
effort
into
it
my
lb
dog
not
always
used
to
fart
all
the
time
by
making
her
notice
it
of
course
the
smell
doesnt
bother
her
and
thence
kicking
her
outside
somewhat
literally
she
came
to
realize
that
she
shoudlnt
do
it
at
least
not
around
me
sort
of
like
that
scene
in
in
the
ministers
study
when
the
secretary
lets
one
fly
and
the
startled
dog
runs
from
the
room
the
minister
explains
every
time
mrs
soandso
breaks
wind
we
beat
the
dog
