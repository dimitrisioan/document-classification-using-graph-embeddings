riding
to
work
last
week
via
hwy
from
suisun
to
i
was
pulled
over
by
a
chp
black
and
white
by
the
gas
station
by
jameson
canyon
road
the
officer
stated
it
looked
like
you
were
going
kinda
fast
coming
down
highway
you
must
have
been
going
at
least
or
i
just
said
okay
and
did
not
agree
or
disagree
to
anything
he
said
the
next
time
you
get
stoped
by
a
cop
never
never
never
admit
to
anything
dont
volunteer
any
information
when
a
retoracle
question
is
ask
by
the
cop
like
it
looked
like
you
were
going
kinda
fast
coming
down
highway
you
must
have
been
going
at
least
or
the
correct
reponse
is
to
deny
it
this
technique
is
employed
by
police
to
help
establish
guilt
especially
when
times
out
of
heshe
is
not
sure
who
was
doing
the
speeding
if
the
cop
is
unsure
this
may
be
the
difference
of
him
letting
you
off
the
hook
or
getting
the
tissue
hope
this
helps
for
next
time
