I
WAS
ENJOYING
LUNCH
THIS
SATURDAY
AT
FOODIES
IN
MILFORD
NH
WITH
AN
ASSORTMENT
OF
OTHER
NEDOD
FOLKS
WHEN
DEAN
COOKSON
YES
HE
HAS
NOT
LEFT
THE
COUNTRY

MENTIONED
THAT
THE
WIRING
DIAGRAM
OF
THE

THAT
THE
LIGHT
SWITCH
IS
A
THREE
POSITION
SWITCH
HIGH
BEAM
LOW
BEAM
BOTH
BEAMS
WELL
THE
ACTUAL
ERGONOMICS
OF
THE
SWITCH
MAKE
IT
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
POSITION
SWITCH
BUT
SURE
ENOUGH
AS
DEAM
EXPECTED
WHEN
YOU
BALANCE
THE
TOGGLE
SWITCH
IN

A

CAREFUL
DOING
THIS
I
USED
TO
BALANCE
THE
SWITCH
ON
MY

CIBIE
INSERT
SO
THAT
BOTH
BEAMS
WERE
ON
I
EVENTUALLY
FRIED
