i
was
enjoying
lunch
this
saturday
at
foodies
in
milford
nh
with
an
assortment
of
other
nedod
folks
when
dean
cookson
yes
he
has
not
left
the
country
yet
mentioned
that
the
wiring
diagram
of
the
shows
that
the
light
switch
is
a
three
position
switch
high
beam
low
beam
both
beams
well
the
actual
ergonomics
of
the
switch
make
it
appear
to
be
a
position
switch
but
sure
enough
as
deam
expected
when
you
balance
the
toggle
switch
in
the
center
position
both
the
high
and
low
beams
go
on
this
provides
a
very
nice
light
coverage
of
the
road
this
is
true
for
the
and
the
and
i
would
expect
for
any
other
late
model
honda
with
the
standard
two
position
light
switch
thanks
to
dean
for
reading
the
schematics
try
it
youll
like
it
be
a
bit
careful
doing
this
i
used
to
balance
the
switch
on
my
avec
cibie
insert
so
that
both
beams
were
on
i
eventually
fried
the
main
ignition
switch
as
it
wasnt
designed
to
pass
that
sort
of
current
