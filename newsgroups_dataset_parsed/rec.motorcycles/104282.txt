OBSERVATION
RE
HELMETS
GRF
DROPPED
MY
SHOEI
OFF
THE
SEAT
OF
MY
BIKE
WHILE
TRYING
TO
ROCK
IT
ONTO
ITS
CENTERSTAND
CHIPPED
THE
HECK
OUT
OF
THE
PAINT
ON
IT
SO
I
CHEERFULLY
SPENT
ON
A
BOTTLE
OF
TESTORS
MODEL
PAINT
AND
REPAINTED
THE
SCRATCHES
AND
CHIPS
FOR
MINUTES
THEN
WHILE
IT
WAS
DRYING
I
REALIZED
THAT
I
WAS
OUT
OF
SMOKES
AND
THAT
MY
CAGE
IS
NOT
CURRENTLY
RUNNING
SO
I
HAD
TO
TAKE
MY
BIKE
DOWN
TO
THE
STORE
NOT
WANTING
TO
MESS
UP
MY
PAINT
JOB
I
SAID
WELL
HECK
I
CAN
JUST
USE
MY
OLD
HELMET
THIS
IS
YOUR
STANDARD
EL
CHEAPIE
OPENFACE
I
DIDNT
NOTICE
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
WHEN
I
SWITCHED
TO
THE
SHOEI
BUT
SWITCHING
BACK
WAS
REALLY
BAD
DOESNT
FIT
WORTH
A
DAMN
TOO
WIDE
IN
THE
SIDES
TOO
SHORT
FRONT
TO
BACK
WITH
A
FACEPLATE
ITS
STILL
BLOODY
WINDY
WITH
THE
SHOEI
I
NORMALLY
IGNORE
THE
FACE
SHIELD
UNTIL
I
GET
UP
TO
ABOUT
WITH
THIS
ONE
TAXIING
TO
THE
END
OF
THE
DRIVEWAY
WAS
TOO
SMEGGING
MUCH
WIND
THE
QUESTION
FOR
THE
DAY
IS
RE
PASSENGER
HELMETS
IF
YOU
DONT
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
WHOS
GONNA
RIDE
WITH
YOU
LIKE
SAY
YOU
MEET
THEM
AT
A
CHURCH
MEETING
YEAH
THATS
THE
TICKET
WHAT
ARE
SOME
GUIDELINES
SHOULD
I
JUST
PICK
UP
ANOTHER
SHOEI
IN
MY
SIZE
TO
HAVE
A
BACKUP
HELMET
XL
OR
SHOULD
I
MAYBE
GET
AN
INEXPENSIVE
ONE
OF
A
SMALLER
SIZE
TO
ACCOMODATE
MY
LIKELY
PASSENGER
