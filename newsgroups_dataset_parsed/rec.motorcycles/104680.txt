I
NEED
SOME
ADVICE
ON
HAVING
SOMEONE
RIDE
PILLION
WITH
ME
ON
MY
NINJA
THIS
WILL
BE
THE
THE
FIRST
TIME
IVE
TAKEN
ANYONE
FOR
AN
EXTENDED
RIDE
READ
FARTHER
THAN
AROUND

BLOCK
WELL
BE
RIDING
SOME
TWISTY

LOOP
FOR
YOU
SF
BAY
AREANS
AN
EXTENDED
RIDE
AS
A
PASSENGER
ON
A
NINJA
OWWW
WELL
I
HATE
TO
BE
A
WET
SOCK
BUT
WELL
I
WAS
A
PASSENGER
ON
MANY
BIKES
FOR
THE
LONGEST
TIME
BEFORE
I
STARTED
RIDING
MYELF
AND
I
GREW
TO
HATE
LONG
RIDES
ON
SPORT
BIKES
THE
PASSENGER
SEATS
ARE
NOT
DESIGNED
FOR
LONG
RIDES
THE
PASSENGER
POSITIONS
ARENT
EVEN
USUALLY
DESIGNED
FOR
SHORT
RIDES
I
ENDED
UP
TORTURING
MY
KNEES
AND
MY
BACK
BY
TAKING
LONG
RIDES
AS
A
PASSENGER
ON
SPORT
BIKES
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
I
ORIGINALLY
LIKED
MY
CURRENT
GUYTHINGY
SO
MUCH
WAS
BECASE
HE
HAD
A
BMW
ID
SUGGEST
A
SHORTER
EXTENDED
RIDE
AT
FIRST
A
SHORT
TURN
IN
THE
MOUNTAINS
OR
SOME
SUCH
THEN
SEE
HOW
MUCH
PAIN
SHES
IN
AND
PROCEED
FROM
THERE
THE
BEST
ADVICE
ID
GIVE
A
BEGINNING
PASSENGER
DONT
GET
ON
THE
BIKE
UNTIL
THE
RIDER
SAYS
ITS
OK
AND
WORK
OUT
SOME
SORT
SIGNAL
FOR
THE
RIDER
TO
TELL
YOU
WHEN
ITS
OK
TO
GET
OFF
AFTER
I
GET
ON
THE
BIKE
I
SQUEEZE
MY
RIDERS
HIPS
TO
TELL
THAT
IM
READY
AND
AT
THE
STOP
HE
NODS
HIS
HEAD
TO
SHOW
ITS
OK
FOR
ME
TO
GET
OFF
KEEP
YOUR
FEET
ON
THE
PEGS
AT
ALL
TIMES
DONT
WIGGLE
UNLESS
YOUR
RIDER
ASKS
YOU
TO
THE
BEST
PASSENGERS
ARE
THOSE
WHICH
ARE
UNOBTRUSIVE
ECHO
THE
MOVEMENTS
AND
LEAN
OF
YOUR
RIDER
LOOK
OVER
THE
SHOULDER
THATS
MOST
COMFORTABLE
BUT
DURING
TURNS
LOOK
OVER
THE
SHOULDER
ON
THE
INSIDE
OF
THE
TURN
GET
USED
TO
YOUR
RIDERS
SHIFTING
STYLE
RIDERS
USE
A
REASONABLY
CONSISTENT
SHIFTING
STYLE
AVOID
HELMET
BONK
HELMET
BONK
IS
WHEN
YOUR
RIDER
REVS
THE
BIKE
UP
AND
THEN
SHIFTS
AND
THE
SUDDEN
CHANGE
IN
FOREWARD
ACCELERATION
CAUSES
YOUR
HELMET
TO
BONK
HISHERS
IT
GETS
OLD
REAL
FAST
WHEN
PULLING
TO
A
STOP
PUT
A
HAND
OR
BOTH
HANDS
ON
THE
TANK
TO
KEEP
YOUR
WEIGHT
FROM
PUSHING
YOUR
RIDER
UP
ONTO
THE
TANK
PUTTING
YOUR
HANDS
ON
THE
TANK
IS
ALSO
A
GOOD
WAY
TO
STRETCH
YOUR
BACK
IF
YOURE
IN
PAIN
BUT
IM
TOLD
IT
GETS
HARDER
TO
STEER
IN
TURNS
IF
YOU
LEAVE
THEM
THERE
SWITCH
YOUR
HANDS
TO
THE
GUARDRAIL
TO
STRETCH
YOUR
SHOULDERS
BUT
BE
SURE
AND
SQUEEZE
YOUR
THIGHS
WHILE
YOURE
DOING
IT
SO
YOUR
RIDER
KNOWS
YOURE
STILL
THERE
THE
GUARD
RAIL
ISNT
AS
SAFE
AS
HOLDING
ONTO
YOUR
RIDER
DONT
BE
AFRAID
TO
ASK
FOR
FREQUENT
STOPS
IF
YOURE
IN
PAIN
OR
LOSING
FEELING
IN
YOUR
FEET
PASSENGER
SEATS
ARE
NOT
GENERALLY
DESIGNED
FOR
COMFORT
WORK
OUT
SOME
SORT
OF
PULL
