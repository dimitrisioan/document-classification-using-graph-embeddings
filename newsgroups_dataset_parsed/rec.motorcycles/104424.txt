how
to
act
in
front
of
traffic
jerks
date
thu
apr
gmt
the
other
day
it
was
raining
cats
and
dogs
therefor
i
was
going
only
to
the
speed
limit
on
nothing
more
on
my
bike
this
guy
in
his
bmw
was
driving
meters
behind
me
for
meters
and
at
the
next
red
light
i
calmly
put
the
bike
on
its
leg
walked
back
to
this
car
he
rolled
down
the
window
and
i
told
him
he
was
a
total
idiot
and
the
reason
why
did
i
do
the
right
thing
it
works
for
me
i
avoid
obscenities
and
try
to
remain
calm
cool
and
collected
and
try
something
like
you
almost
just
killed
me
and
im
not
moving
until
you
apologize
or
something
more
or
less
benign
like
that
i
havent
been
shot
a
single
time
but
i
dont
do
it
in
texas
and
i
do
only
do
it
when
there
are
plenty
of
witnesses
around
