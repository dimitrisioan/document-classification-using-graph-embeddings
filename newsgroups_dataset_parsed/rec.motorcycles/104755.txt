re
i
need
your
advice
im
a
new
rider
in
article
writes
i
have
a
very
important
question
that
i
havent
been
able
to
find
an
answer
toive
asked
mechanics
and
others
about
this
but
no
one
can
really
give
me
an
answer
that
satisfies
me
i
just
bought
a
brand
new
kawasaki
ninja
i
am
a
firsttime
buyer
as
well
as
a
firsttime
rider
and
this
bike
seemed
to
satisfy
all
my
needs
this
may
be
the
reason
i
dont
know
the
answer
to
this
question
the
tachometer
has
a
sticker
right
on
it
that
says
for
the
first
miles
do
not
go
over
rpms
and
for
the
next
miles
dont
go
over
referred
to
as
the
breakin
period
if
you
didnt
know
well
if
i
were
to
do
that
i
would
never
be
going
over
mph
even
in
gear
so
my
question
is
will
it
hurt
my
new
cycle
to
take
it
up
in
the
rpm
range
so
that
i
can
at
least
go
the
speed
limit
any
information
that
any
of
you
could
give
me
would
be
greatly
appreciated
just
send
the
reply
to
my
account
or
if
youd
like
back
to
the
net
thank
you
very
much
for
taking
the
time
to
readreply
to
this
chris
