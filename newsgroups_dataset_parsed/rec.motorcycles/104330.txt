what
about
nofault
insurance
companies
sure
seem
to
go
for
nofault
coverage
since
the
majority
of
accidents
are
the
cagers
fault
doesnt
this
imply
that
we
would
have
to
pay
much
higher
rates
under
a
nofault
system
with
a
carsonly
system
it
seems
to
make
sense
on
the
surface
take
the
legal
costs
out
of
the
system
but
it
looks
like
motorcyclists
would
get
screwed
