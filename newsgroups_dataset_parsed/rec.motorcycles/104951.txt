IF
IM
RIDING
I
WOULD
FAR
SOONER
HAVE
THE
PILLION
HANGING
ON
TO
THE
BIKE
RATHER
THAN
ME
BECAUSE
I
FIND
THAT
THEIR
WEIGHT
CAN
CAUSE
ME
TO
MOVE
AND
THAT
CAN
UPSET
THE
BALANCE
OF
THE
BIKE
MOST
OF
THE
PILLIONS
I
SEE
OVER
HERE
HOLD
THE
GRABRAIL
THE
REALLY
GOOD
ONES
DONT
HANG
ON
TO
ANYTHING
UNLESS
VIOLENT
ACCELERATION
IS
TAKING
PLACE
HMMMMNDONT
YOU
RIDE
WITH
YOUR
SWEETHEART
