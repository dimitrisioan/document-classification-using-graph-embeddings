if
im
riding
i
would
far
sooner
have
the
pillion
hanging
on
to
the
bike
rather
than
me
because
i
find
that
their
weight
can
cause
me
to
move
and
that
can
upset
the
balance
of
the
bike
most
of
the
pillions
i
see
over
here
hold
the
grabrail
the
really
good
ones
dont
hang
on
to
anything
unless
violent
acceleration
is
taking
place
hmmmmndont
you
ride
with
your
sweetheart
only
in
my
dreams
