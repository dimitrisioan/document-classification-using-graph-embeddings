RE
OK
SO
I
WAS
A
LITTLE
HASTY
IN
ARTICLE
INFANTEACPUBDUKEEDU
ANDREW
INFANTE
WRITES
ALSO
NC
RECENTLY
LAST
FEW
YEARS
DECIDED
THAT
DUE
TO
THE
FACT
THERE
ARE
CONSTANTLY
PEOPLE
ON
THE
ROAD
DRUNK
DRIVING
THEY
WILL
RAISE
THEIR
AWARENESS
OF
IT
BY
MAKING
STRICTER
LAWS
AND
AS
SUCH
NOW
I
BELIEVE
NC
HAS
THE
TOUGHEST
LAWS
FOR
DWI
WHILE
NOT
NECESSARILY
INCREASING
ANY
AMOUNT
OF
AWARENESS
OR
KILLS
ON
THE
HIGHWAYS
MEANING
ITS
ONLY
MADE
A
DIFFERENCE
AT
SENTENCING
AUTOMATIC
REVOCATION
OF
YOUR
LICENSE
FOR
A
YEAR
IM
NOT
SURE
ITS
THE
TOUGHTEST
LAW
AROUND
BUT
NC
HAS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
SENSE
OF
HUMOR
WITH
RESPECT
TO
DRIVING
LAWS
ANYWAY
I
THINK
THEY
PUT
YOU
IN
JAIL
AND
SELL
YOUR
FIRST
CHILD
INTO
SLAVERY
FOR
PASSING
A
SCHOOL
BUS
A
BILL
BREEZED
THROUGH
THE
NC
HOUSE
TO
LOWER
THE
INTOXIFICATION
LEVEL
FROM
TO
IT
FACES
STIFF
OPPOSITION
IN
THE
SENATE
RECENTLY
THE
HIGHWAY
PATROL
TOOK
A
FEW
OF
THE
OPPOSITION
SENATORS
OUT
AND
GAVE
THEM
SOME
SHOTS
AND
WHEN
THEY
HIT
PUT
THEM
ON
A
COURSE
DODGING
CONES
THEY
FAILED
AND
WILL
PROBABLY
CHANGE
THEIR
VOTES
AS
A
RESULT
FOR
SOME
BIZARRE
REASON
NC
IS
THE
ONLY
STATE
WHERE
THE
GOVERNER
HAS
NO
VETO
POWER
OVER
LEGISLATION
COMING
OUT
OF
THE
STATE
CONGRESS
SO
HIS
OPINION
ON
THE
MATTER
IS
MOOT
ED
GREEN
FORMER
NINJAITE
I
WAS
DRINKING
LAST
NIGHT
WITH
A
BIKER
EDGREENEASTSUNCOM
AND
I
SHOWED
HIM
A
PICTURE
OF
YOU
I
SAID
DOD
GO
ON
GET
TO
KNOW
HER
YOULL
LIKE
HER
THE
GRATEFUL
DEAD
IT
SEEMED
LIKE
THE
LEAST
I
COULD
DO
