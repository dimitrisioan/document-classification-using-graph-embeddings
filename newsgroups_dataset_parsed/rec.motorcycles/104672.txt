yes
even
when
steering
no
hands
you
do
something
quite
similar
to
countersteering
basically
to
turn
left
you
to
a
quick
wiggle
of
the
bike
to
the
right
first
causing
a
counteracting
lean
to
occur
to
the
left
this
sounds
suspiciously
like
black
magic
to
me
if
by
quick
wiggle
to
the
right
you
mean
that
the
handlebars
turn
toward
the
right
before
turning
to
the
left
what
is
the
input
to
the
steering
mechanism
that
makes
this
happen
in
the
absence
of
the
old
