re
krypto
cables
was
re
cobra
locks
to
followup
i
had
a
bad
experience
w
a
krypto
lock
too
last
year
i
bought
a
krypto
cable
ii
long
something
like
that
that
by
all
standards
seemed
like
a
decent
piece
until
i
used
it
anyway
before
i
ever
used
it
for
security
purposes
i
used
it
for
entertainment
minds
out
of
the
gutter
please
which
is
to
say
that
i
sat
fiddling
w
it
while
watching
tv
the
night
i
got
it
after
three
minutes
of
mindless
fiddling
of
course
it
was
mindless

was
watching
tv

entire
tumbler
mechanism
came
out
on
the
key
not
unlike
that
old
georgieporgie
nursery
rhyme
this
left
a
very
empty
cylinder
and
a
very
nonsecure
read
swingin
in
the
