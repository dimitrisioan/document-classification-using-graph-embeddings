I
CANT
HELP
MYSELF
IVE
TRIED
TO
BE
RATIONAL
TO
LOOK
THE
OTHER
WAY
BUT
EVERYTIME
IT
HAPPENS
ITS
UNCONTROLLABLE
I
HATE
MOTORCYCLES
AT
FIRST
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
A
PHASE
I
THOUGH
I
WOULD
GET
USED
TO
THEM
IT
DIDNT
HAPPEN
I
TRIED
GAZING
AT
AND
CUSTOMS
BUT
EACH
TIME
I
SADISTICALLY
PICTURED
THEM
BEING
HURLED
OFF
OF
LARGE
PRECIPICE
I
ALSO
PICTURE
A
SWARM
OF
GERMAN
TOURISTS
CHEERING
AND
TAKING
HOLIDAY
SNAPS
BUT
I
CANT
FIGURE
THAT
PART
OUT
WHAT
AM
I
TO
DO
EVERYTIME
I
READ
A

WONDER
I
SHUDDER
AND
FEEL
PITY
THAT
THE
POOR
SOUL
HAS
SUFFERED
ENOUGH
I
IMAGINE
THE

SCRAPPING
OUT
HIS

I
HAD
IN
THE
PAST
LOATHED
THE

BUT
I
CAN
ACTUALLY
BEGIN
TO
UNDERSTAND
SOME
OF
THE
PREACHING
THERE
MUST
