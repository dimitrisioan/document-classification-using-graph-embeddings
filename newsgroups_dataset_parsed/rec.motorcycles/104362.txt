my
previous
posting
on
dog
attacks
must
have
generated
some
bad
karma
or
something
ive
weathered
attempted
dog
attacks
before
using
the
approved
method
slow
down
to
screw
up
dogs
triangulation
of
target
then
take
off
and
laugh
at
the
dog
now
far
behind
you
this
time
it
didnt
work
because
i
didnt
have
time
riding
up
the
hill
leading
to
my
house
i
encountered
a
liverandwhite
springer
spaniel
no
relation
to
the
springer
softail
or
the
springer
spagthorpe
a
close
relation
to
the
spagthorpe
viking
actually
the
dog
encountered
me
with
intent
to
harm
interesting
dog
collision
story
deleted
what
worries
me
about
the
accident
is
this
i
dont
think
i
could
have
prevented
it
except
by
traveling
much
slower
than
i
was
this
is
not
necessarily
an
unreasonable
suggestion
for
a
residential
area
but
i
was
riding
around
the
speed
limit
i
worry
about
what
would
have
happened
if
it
had
been
a
car
instead
of
a
dog
but
i
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
would
take
a
truly
insane
bdi
cager
to
whip
out
of
a
blind
driveway
at
mph
for
that
matter
how
many
driveways
are
long
enough
for
a
car
to
hit
mph
by
the
end
i
eagerly
await
comment
my
driveway
and
about
half
my
neighbors
driveways
are
long
enough
to
do
a
good
clicks
for
the
velocity
impaired
if
we
wanted
to
granted
i
live
in
the
country
however
ive
seen
neighbors
whip
out
of
their
driveways
at
the
above
mentioned
mph
quite
a
bit
they
claim
they
can
tell
that
theres
noone
on
the
road
for
quite
a
ways
this
despite
having
nearly
been
hit
myself
by
one
of
them
while
driving
a
chev
and
twice
taking
my
bicycle
over
the
hood
of
a
car
that
had
pulled
out
saw
me
then
stopped
same
driver
same
car
about
two
months
apart
obmoto
the
scary
relevant
part
is
that
these
people
and
i
live
on
the
type
of
twisty
two
lane
that
we
all
favor
for
riding
and
i
know
damn
well
that
they
cant
see
me
on
my
bike
not
if
they
couldnt
see
me
in
my
pickup
