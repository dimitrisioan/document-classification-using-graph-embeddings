RE
XS
NEVER
NEEDS
VALVE
ADJUSTMENTS
STEVE
SMEAD
WRITES
I
BOUGHT
A
YAMAHA
WITH
MILES
OVER
THE
LAST
YEARS
IVE
PUT
OF
COMMUTE
MILES
ONNIT
VALVE
ADJUSTMENT
INTERVALS
ARE
SUPPOSSED
TO
BE
EVERY
WELL
EVERY
OR
SO
IVE
CHECKED
THE
PAD
CLEARENCES
AND
THEY
NEVER
CHANGE
IF
ANYTHING
THE
CLEARANCES
SEEM
TO
BE
GETTING
A
LITTLE
SMALLER
WHICH
MAKES
NO
SENSE
TO
ME
WITH
THE
PAD
SYSTEM
THE
PADS
SHOULD
WEAR
UNTIL
THE
CLEARANCES
ARE
TOO
GREAT
RIGHT
I
KNOW
THAT
THREADED
ADJUSTERS
CAN
TIGHTEN
UP
BUT
I
DIDNT
THINK
THESE
KIND
COULD
BOTTOM
LINES
IS
THAT
I
HAVENT
TOUCHED
MY
VALVES
FOR
ON
THIS
BIKE
AND
THEY
ARE
STILL
NICE
AND
QUIET
AND
IF
ANYTHING
THE
CLEARANCES
ARE
TIGHTER
WHATS
THE
DEAL
ANY
OTHER
YAM
TRIPLE
OWNERS
NOTICE
EXTREMELY
LONG
VALVE
ADJUSTMENT
INTERVALS
YEAH
I
HAD
AN
THAT
WAS
THE
SAME
THE
VALVE
SEATS
TEND
TO
WEAR
VERY
SLOWLY
AND
ANYTHING
THAT
MIGHT
GET
TAKEN
OFF
THE
PAD
WHICH
SHOULDNT
REALLY
WEAR
WILL
TEND
TO
COMPENSATE
SO
ITS
A
SORT
OF
SELFCOMPENSATING
SYSTEM
