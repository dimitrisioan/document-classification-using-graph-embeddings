MIKE
SIXSMITH
WRITES
ALL
OF
US
THAT
ARGUE
ABOUT
GYROSCOPES
ETC
THROUGHLY
UNDERSTAND
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
INCLUDING
ALL
THE
ONES
WHO
THINK
THAT
THEY
COUNTERSTEER
ALL
THE
WAY
THROUGH
A
CORNER
WELL
ALL
THE
WAY
THROUGH
A
DECREASINGRADIUS
CORNER
ANYWAY
THIS
IS
REALLY
THE
ONLY
THING
WE
DISAGREE
ON
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
OK
BUT
IM
RIGHT
THE
OFFICIAL
LINE
HERE
THOUGH
I
DO
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
ABOUT
IT
IS
THAT
THE
FRONT
BRAKE
IS
APPLIED
FIRST
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
REAR
BRAKE
THE
IDEA
BEING
THAT
YOU
AVOID
LOCKING
UP
THE
REAR
AFTER
WEIGHT
TRANSFER
TAKES
PLACE
IF
THATS
THE
OFFICIAL
LINE
TAUGHT
IN
THOSE
RIDER
EDUCATION
CLASSES
YOU
WERE
REFERING
TO
THAT
ALSO
DONT
TEACH
COUNTERSTEERING
I
HAVE
TO
QUESTION
THE
QUALITY
OF
THE
CLASSES
THE
OFFICIAL
LINE
IN
MSF
CURRICULA
IS
AS
I
DESCRIBED
MAXIMUM
BRAKING
IS
ACHIEVED
BY
APPLYING
BOTH
BRAKES
EQUALLY
WHEN
THE
WEIGHT
DISTRIBUTION
IS
NOMINALLY
EVEN
AND
BOTH
TIRES
HAVE
EQUAL
NORMAL
FORCES
AND
EASING
OFF
ON
THE
REAR
TO
PREVENT
LOCKING
IT
AND
INCREASING
BRAKING
ON
THE
FRONT
AS
MORE
TRACTION
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
FRONT
DUE
TO
INCREASED
NORMAL
FORCE
DUE
TO
WEIGHT
SHIFT
THE
OFFICIAL
LINE
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
TAUGHT
SEEMS
INEFFECTIVE
ON
THE
FACE
OF
IT
APPLYING
THE
REAR
BRAKE
AFTER
THE
FRONT
IS
NOT
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
ALL
THE
TRACTION
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
REAR
AT
TIME
AND
IS
HALVING
THE
AVAILABLE
BRAKING
POWER
BY
USING
ONLY
THE
FRONT
AT
TIME
SAYING
BRAKE
UNTIL
THE
TIRE
JUST
BEGINS
TO
SLIDE
IS
NEXT
TO
USELESS
ADVICE
TO
A
NEWBIE
HE
HAS
TO
GO
OUT
AND
SLIDE
THE
TIRE
TO
FIND
OUT
WHERE
THAT
IS
IT
ALSO
GIVES
HIM
ZERO
INFORMATION
FROM
WHICH
TO
DEVELOP
A
BRAKING
TECHNIQUE
THAT
CHANGES
AS
THE
BRAKING
AND
CORRESPONDING
WEIGHT
SHIFT
DEVELOP
IF
YOU
DONT
SLIDE
THE
TYRE
YOU
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
WHETHER
YOUVE
ACHIEVED
MAXIMUM
BRAKING
OR
NOT
IM
NOT
SUGGESTING
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
ALWAYS
AIM
TO
BRAKE
AS
HARD
AS
YOU
POSSIBLY
CAN
BUT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
FIND
THE
LIMITS
OF
THE
MACHINE
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
BEYOND
THEM
NOT
NECESSARILY
TRUE
CHIRPING
THE
TIRE
INDICATES
IMPENDING
LOCKUP
ON
MOST
SURFACES
AND
SERVES
AS
A
GOOD
GUIDE
TO
NEWBIES
TO
INDICATE
MAXIMUM
BRAKING
I
AGREE
THAT
TOTALLY
LOCKING
THE
FRONT
OCCASIONALLY
MAKES
ONE
A
BETTER
RIDER
BUT
IT
IS
A
MANUVER
BEST
SAVED
FOR
AN
EXPERIENCED
RIDER
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
ONE
OF
THOSE
OUTRIGGER
BIKES
LIKE
CODE
USED
TO
USE
IN
ANY
CASE
FOR
MAXIMUM
BRAKING
IF
AS
I
SUGGESTED
YOU
AIM
TO
KEEP
BOTH
WHEELS
JUST
ON
THE
POINT
OF
SLIDING
THEN
YOULL
BE
DOING
EXACTLY
AS
YOU
SUGGEST
TRUE
BUT
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
HOW
TO
BEST
TEACH
RIDING
SKILLS
WHICH
IS
HOW
THIS
DISCUSSION
STARTED
KEEP
BOTH
WHEELS
JUST
ON
THE
POINT
OF
SLIDING
IS
NEARLY
USELESS
INFORMATION
YOU
NEED
TO
TEACH
A
TECHNIQUE
OR
AT
LEAST
A
STRATEGY
TO
ACHIEVE
THIS
ED
GREEN
FORMER
NINJAITE
I
WAS
DRINKING
LAST
NIGHT
WITH
A
BIKER
EDGREENEASTSUNCOM
AND
I
SHOWED
HIM
A
PICTURE
OF
YOU
I
SAID
DOD
GO
ON
GET
TO
KNOW
HER
YOULL
LIKE
HER
THE
GRATEFUL
DEAD
IT
SEEMED
LIKE
THE
LEAST
I
COULD
DO
