WHERE
CAN
I
AFFORD
A
GOLDWING
MIRROR
SEARCHED
WITHOUT
LUCK
FOR
A
FAQ
HERE
I
NEED
A
LEFT
ASPENCADE
MIRROR
AND
HONDA
WANTS
FOR
IT
NOW
IF
THIS
WERE
ANOTHER
PIECE
OF
CHROME
TO
REPLACE
THE
BLACK
PLASTIC
THAT
WINGS
COME
SO
LIBERALLY
SUPPLIED
WITH
I
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
SEE
THAT
SILLY
PRICE
BUT
A
MIRROR
IS
A
PIECE
OF
SAFETY
EQUIPMENT
THE
FACT
THAT
HONDA
CLEARLY
PLACES
CONCERN
FOR
THEIR
PROFITS
AHEAD
OF
CONCERN
FOR
MY
SAFETY
IS
ENOUGH
TO
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
THIS
MY
THIRD
WING
WILL
LIKELY
BE
MY
LAST
IN
THE
MEAN
TIME
ANYBOBY
HAVE
A
NONRIPOFF
SOURCE
FOR
A
MIRROR
