I
THINK
THE
COPS
AND
DONT
YOU
DARE
DRINK
DRIVE
TM
COMMERCIALS
WILL
USUALLY
SAY
IN
GENERAL
BUT
AFTER
ABOUT
DRINKS
AND
HRS
YOU
COULD
VERY
WELL
BE
OVER
THE
LEGAL
LIMIT
WATCH
YOURSELF
INDEED
ESPECIALLY
IF
YOU
ARE
SMART
AND
EAT
SOME
FOOD
WITH
YOUR
DRINK
THE
FOOD
COATING
THE
STOMACH
LINING
ESPECIALLY
THINGS
LIKE
MILK
CAN
TEMPORARILY
RETARD
THE
ABSORPTION
OF
ALCOHOL
WHEN
THE
FOOD
IS
DIGESTED
THE
ABSORPTION
WILL
PROCEED
AND
YOU
WILL
ACTUALLY
BE
DRUNKER
IE
HAVE
A
HIGHER
INSTANTANEOUS
BAC
THAN
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
IF
YOU
HAD
DRUNK
DRINKHR
ON
AN
EMPTY
STOMACH
PUT
ANOTHER
WAY
FOOD
CAN
CAUSE
YOU
TO
BE
LESS
DRUNK
THAN
DRINKING
ON
AN
EMPTY
STOMACH
EARLY
ON
IN
THOSE
FIVE
HOURS
BUT
MORE
DRUNK
THAN
DRINKING
ON
AN
EMPTY
STOMACH
LATER
IN
THOSE
FIVE
HOURS

THE
ABSOLUTE
MOST
THAT
EATING
BEFORE
DRINKING
CAN
DO
IS
SLOW
THE
ABSORPTION
DOWN
BY
MINUTES
THAT
GIVES
ME
TIME
TO
EAT
SLAM
ONE
BEER

RIDE
LIKE
