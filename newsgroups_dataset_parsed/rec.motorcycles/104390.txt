if
it
is
the
other
drivers
fault
your
insurance
co
pays
you
less
deductible
then
recoups
the
total
cost
from
the
other
guygals
company
theres
a
fancy
word
for
it
which
escapes
me
right
now
and
pays
you
the
deductible
or
you
can
go
to
the
other
guygals
company
right
off
just
takes
longer
to
get
your
cash
as
opposed
to
state
farm
who
cut
me
a
check
today
on
the
spot
for
the
damage
to
my
wifes
cage
the
word
is
subrogation
seems
to
me
if
youre
willing
to
wait
for
the
money
from
scumbags
insurance
that
you
save
having
to
pay
the
deductible
however
if
scumbags
insurance
is
scum
insurance
then
you
may
have
to
pay
the
deductible
to
get
your
insurance
cos
pack
of
rabid
large
fanged
lawyers
to
recover
the
damages
from
scum
insurances
lawyers
sad
but
true
call
it
job
security
for
lawyers
later

you
know
it
sounds
suspiciously
like
no
fault
doesnt
even
do
what
it
was
advertised
as
doinggetting
the
lawyers
out
of
the
loop
sigh
another
naive
illusion
down
the
