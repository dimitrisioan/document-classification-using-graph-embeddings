EXHAUST
COATING
SINCE
AT
LEAST
ONE
OTHER
PERSON
WAS
INTERESTED
IN
THIS
MY
FZRS
BLACK
EXHAUST
PIPES
ARE
RUSTY
AND
I
RESEARCHED
GETTING
THEM
REPAIRED
YESTERDAY
I
BOUGHT
A
CAN
OF
VHT
DEGREE
BLACK
HEADER
PAINT
AND
SPENT
AN
HOUR
SANDING
TWO
OF
THE
HEADER
PIPES
BY
HAND
SPRAYED
ON
PAINT
THOUGHT
ABOUT
HOW
CLEAN
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
THE
METAL
WITH
SANDING
AND
DETERMINED
THAT
I
WOULDNT
BE
AT
ALL
SUPRISED
IF
THE
PAINT
WORECHIPPED
OFF
IN
A
MONTH
SOOOO
CALL
A
COUPLE
OF
PLACES
UP
IN
MINNEAPOLIS
AND
DISCOVER
THAT
POWDER
COATING
WHILE
EXTREMELY
DURABLE
WILL
NOT
HANDLE
OVER
DEGREE
TEMPERATURES
THE
PLACE
I
TALKED
TO
SAID
THEY
WERE
EXPERIMENTING
WITH
SOME
NEW
POWDER
THAT
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
HANDLE
DEGREES
BUT
THAT
IT
WOULDNT
BE
AVAILABLE
FOR
MONTHS
AT
LEAST
THEY
DIRECTED
ME
TO
ANOTHER
SHOP
THAT
SPECIALIZES
IN
HEADER
COATING
THE
OTHER
SHOP
SAID
THEY
HAVE
COATINGS
AVAILABLE
ONE
IS
ALUMINIZED
THAT
CAN
DO
DEGREES
AND
IS
COMPARABLE
TO
POWDER
COATING
FOR
DURABILITY
THE
OTHER
IS
SILICON
I
THINK
BASED
AND
CAN
DO
DEGREES
BUT
IS
THINNER
AND
NOT
AS
DURABLE
BOTH
COATINGS
HAVE
A
TEXTURED
FINISH
NOT
SUPER
SMOOTH
AND
SHOULD
BE
CLEANED
WITH
HOT
WATER
AND
A
BRUSH
PRICE
FOR
HEADER
PIPES
AND
A
COLLECTOR
WAS
IM
PLANNING
TO
TAKE
THE
PARTS
UP
FRIDAY
AND
GET
THEM
BACK
UPS
NEXT
WEEK
MAYBE
WEDNESDAY
SOUNDS
TO
ME
LIKE
THIS
KIND
OF
COATING
STUFF
SHOULD
BE
WAY
BETTER
THAN
PAINT
CONSIDERING
HOW
MUCH
ABUSE
THE
PIPES
GET
FROM
ROAD
CRAPROCKS
AXEL
