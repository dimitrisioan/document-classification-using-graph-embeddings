JOHN
STAFFORD
WRITES
ON
APR
GMT
SAID
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
DO
A
WHEELIE
ON
A
MOTORCYCLE
WITH
SHAFTDRIVE
YES
BUT
THE
REAR
WHEEL
COMES
OFF
THE
GROUND
NOT
THE
FRONT
SEE
IT
JUST
HOPS
INTO
THE
AIR
FIGURE
JOHN
STAFFORD
SURE
YOU
CAN
DO
WHEELIES
WITH
A
SHAFT
DRIVE
BIKE
I
HAD
A
BMW
THAT
WAS
A
WHEELIE
MONSTER
OF
COURSE
IT
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
INITIAL
POWER
BURST
TO
JUST
TWIST
IT
INTO
THE
AIR
I
HAD
TO
POP
THE
CLUTCH
I
ALSO
HAD
TO
REPLACE
FRONT
FORK
SEALS
A
FEW
TIMES
AS
WELL
THE
FAIRING
IS
A
BIT
HEAVY
TO
BE
SLAMMING
DOWN
ONTO
THOSE
LITTLE
STANTION
TUBES
ALL
THE
TIME
BUT
LET
ME
GIVE
YOU
FAIR
WARNING
I
TRASHED
THE
RINGPINION
GEAR
IN
THE
FINAL
DRIVE
OF
MY
I
ASSUME
DOING
WHEELIES
AND
THIS
WAS
NO
CHEAP
FIX
EITHER
THERE
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
SLIP
DEVICE
IN
THE
SHAFT
TO
PREVENT
IT
FROM
BREAKING
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
DIDNT
SAVE
THE
GEARS
ON
THE
TOPIC
OF
WHEELIES
THE
OTHER
DAY
I
SAW
A
KID
ON
A
BIG
HURRICANE
DO
A
STOPPY
OR
REAR
WHEELIE
MAN
HE
HAD
THE
REAR
END
ON
THIS
BIKE
UP
ABOUT
FEET
OFF
THE
GROUND
AT
A
TRAFFIC
LIGHT
I
DONT
RECOMMEND
THESE
ACTIVITIES
ANYMORE
NOW
THAT
IM
AN
OLD
GUY
WITH
KIDS
OF
MY
OWN
BUT
IT
LOOKED
DAMN
IMPRESSIVE
IF
YOU
CANT
KEEP
BOTH
TIRES
ON
THE
GROUND
AT
LEAST
HAVE
EM
POINTED
IN
THAT
DIRECTION
CHEERS
