sorry
i
lost
the
attributions
in
most
areas
drivers
are
required
to
show
proof
of
financial
responsibility
which
usually
means
insurance
required
how
when
they
get
pulled
over
most
drivers
bellyaching
on
the
net
aside
dont
get
pulled
over
and
checked
the
laws
are
enforceable
only
after
the
fact
in
which
case
often
somebody
is
out
a
lot
of
money
dont
you
have
any
requirement
for
yearly
plate
stickers
in
the
us
in
ontario
and
manitoba
for
sure
and
the
other
provinces
i
think
you
have
to
show
proof
of
insurnace
when
you
renew
your
plate
ie
get
a
new
sticker
yes
unfortunately
there
is
also
the
concept
that
the
owner
of
a
car
is
not
responsible
for
the
actions
of
any
authorized
user
of
the
car
thats
one
of
the
biggest
arguments
against
photoradar
ticketing
systems
you
also
get
to
pay
all
outstanding
tickets
they
even
have
cross
province
agreements
at
least
between
ontario
and
quebec
so
that
unpaid
tickets
in
the
other
province
are
on
record
no
having
an
up
to
date
sticker
is
a
bad
trouble
with
that
is
you
then
have
no
recourse
if
a
misissued
ticket
or
a
clerical
error
on
a
computer
follow
you
around
the
city
of
chicago
the
informal
motto
of
which
being
the
city
the
works
issues
dozens
of
parking
tickets
each
year
to
people
who
have
never
set
foot
or
tire
in
the
city
