SQUIDS
AND
DEALERS
YESTERDAY
A
FRIEND
HAD
ASKED
ME
TO
ACCOMPANY
HIM
TO
A
LOCAL
MOTORCYCLE
DEALER
IT
HAS
BEEN
A
WHILE
SINCE
HE
LAST
RODE
YEARS
AND
I
MYSELF
HAVE
NEVER
BOUGHT
A
NEW
BIKE
FROM
A
DEALER
WHAT
FOLLOWS
IS
AN
EXPERIENCE
OF
THAT
VISIT
AND
OF
AN
OBSERVATION
OF
SQUILDLY
BEHAVIOR
BY
OTHER
CUSTOMERS
ANDOR
SALES
PERSONEL
BACKGROUND
I
RIDE
WITH
A
GROUP
OF
FRIENDS
WHO
MAINLY
ARE
INTO
CRUISER
TYPE
BIKES
MY
FRIEND
WAS
HELL
BENT
ON
GETTING
AN
INTRUDER
AND
HAD
SEEN
A
FEW
USED
ONES
HE
WANTED
TO
SEE
WHAT
THE
NEW
ONES
WERE
GOING
FOR
SO
WE
HAPPENED
UPON
A
DEALER
THAT
SOLD
BOTH
SUZUKI
AND
YAMAHA
THE
PLACE
WAS
FAIRLY
BUSY
SO
WE
BROWSED
A
BIT
WE
HAPPENED
UPON
A
FEW
INTRUDERS
MOST
OF
WHICH
HAD
SOLD
SIGNS
ON
MY
FRIEND
HAD
BEEN
BITTEN
WELL
THE
SALESDROID
APPEARED
AND
AS
MY
FRIEND
STARTED
CHEWING
THE
FAT
I
MOSEID
ON
OUTSIDE
THE
NEXT
THING
I
KNOW
I
SEE
OR
SPORT
BIKES
PULL
IN
I
COULD
STEREOTYPE
THE
TYPE
OF
RIDERS
BACKWARD
BALL
HAT
OAKLEY
IQ
BUT
I
WONT
WELL
THEY
WENT
INSIDE
I
DIDNT
THINK
MUCH
OF
IT
I
FIGURED
TO
EACH
HIS
OWN
I
WENT
BACK
IN
TO
SEE
IF
THE
SALESDROID
HAD
HIS
FANGS
FIRMLY
IMPLANTED
INTO
MY
FRIENDS
BACK
WHEN
I
NOTICED
THE
HORMONE
GANG
TALKING
TO
OTHER
SALESDROIDSMANAGERS
LOTS
OF
LAUGHTER
JOKES
ETC
NO
BIG
DEAL
HERE
IS
THE
PART
THAT
CONCERNED
ME
THE
HG
AND
THOSE
SHOP
PERSONEL
THAT
WERE
NOT
BUSY
WITH
CUSTOMERS
WENT
BACK
OUT
WHERE
SAID
HG
MEMBERS
FIRED
UP
THEIR
RIDES
AND
DID
THE
OBLIGATORY
REVING
UP
OF
THOSE
BEASTS
AT
THIS
POINT
ONE
DECIDED
TO
SEE
HOW
MUCH
RUBBER
A
KATANA
COULD
DEPOSIT
IN
THE
DRIVE
SQUIDS
I
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF
BUT
I
WAS
APPALLED
THAT
THE
SALESDROIDSMANAGER
NOT
ONLY
CONDONED
THIS
BEHAVIOR
BUT
ENCOURGED
IT
TO
THE
POINT
WERE
THEY
WERE
BETTING
HOW
LONG
HE
COULD
KEEP
IT
UP
AND
EGGED
HIM
ON
TO
PULL
A
WHEELY
AS
HE
RODE
OFF
ONTO
A
BUSY
STREET
AROUND
RUSH
HOUR
THE
GIRL
THAT
WAS
RIDING
PILLION
ON
ANOTHER
BIKE
SEEMED
RATHER
HORMONAL
ABOUT
THIS
DISPLAY
AND
URGED
HER
PILOT
TO
QUICKLY
CATCH
UP
THE
OTHERS
FOLLOWED
MAKING
SURE
THERE
KERKERS
COULD
BE
HEARD
AS
WELL
AS
FELT
I
FELT
EMBARASSED
AT
THIS
POINT
TO
BE
A
MOTORCYCLIST
I
FELT
THE
EYES
OF
THOSE
IN
CAGES
WITNESSING
THIS
DISPLAY
THEN
GLANCING
OVER
TO
THE
DEALERS
LOT
AND
DAMNING
ALL
THOSE
ON
TWO
WHEELS
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
MY
FRIEND
FELT
A
LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE
AND
WE
LEFT
I
WILL
NOW
TURN
OFF
MY
FRUSTRATION
AND
GO
RIDE
PEACEFULLY
TO
CLEAR
MY
ANGER
I
ONLY
HOPE
THAT
THE
COP
WHO
IS
FOLLOWING
ME
HOME
HAS
AN
OPEN
MIND
AND
DOESNT
ASSOCIATE
ME
WITH
THEM
BTW
I
CANT
AFFORD
A
NEW
BIKE
