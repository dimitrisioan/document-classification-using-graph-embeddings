WAS
AN
ARTICLE
IN
ONE
OF
THE
UK

WEEK
ABOUT
A
SOCCER
GOALKEEPER
WHO
HAD
TO
BE
CARRIED
OFF
THE
FIELD
AFTER
A
COLLISION
WITH
A
FORD
SIERRA
CAGE
SEEMS
THE
CAGE
DRIVER
WANTED
TO
TURN
AROUND
BUT
NEEDED
TO
DRIVE
ONTO
THE
PITCH
TO
DO
THIS
SO
HE
WAITED
TILL
THE
BALL
AND
MOST
OF
THE
PLAYERS
WERE
UP
THE
OTHER
END
UNFORTUNATELY
AS
SOON
AS
HE
STARTED
HIS
MANOUVRE
SOMEONE
BOOTED
THE
BALL
BACK
DOWN
THE
PITCH
THE
GOALKEEPER
RAN
BACKWARDS
TOWARDS
HIS
GOAL
STRAIGHT

THE
CAGE
