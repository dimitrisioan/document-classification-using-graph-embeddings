WRITES
HELLO
FOLKS
IM
VERY
HAPPY
WITH
MY
NEW
MY
RANGE
IS
MILES
ON
GALLONS
THATS
MPG
SURPRISINGLY
THE
BIKE
IS
A
REAL
CRUISER
I
WAS
EXPECTING
SOMETHING
ROUGH
SHES
A
SWEET
BACKROAD
HONEY
AND
I
CAN
GO
PRETTY
MUCH
ANYPLACE
ID
TAKE
MY
MOUNTAIN
BIKE
AS
FAR
AS
SHAFT
EFFECT
ITS
MORE
A
TORQUE
EFFECT
FROM
THE
CRANKSHAFT
IN
MY
OPINION
REV
IT
SITTING
STILL
WHEN
THE
DRIVESHAFT
IS
NOT
MOVING
AND
THE
BIKE
TWISTS
A
BIT
MAYBE
I
DONT
RIDE
HER
FAST
ENOUGH
TO
GET
A
SHAFT
EFFECT
BUT
IN
MY
OPINION
NOT
TO
START
ANOTHER
SHAFT
EFFECT
DISCUSSION
BUT
THE
TWIST
YOU
FEEL
WHEN
REVVING
SITTING
STILL
IS
DUE
TO
THE
LARGER
FLYWHEELS
THAT
THE
BMW
RBIKES
MAYBE
KS
TOO
DUNNO
USE
IF
YOU
WHACK
THE
THROTTLE
AT
STOP
LIGHTS
ITLL
REALLY
ROCK
THE
BIKE
OVER
TO
THE
RIGHT
SNIP
SNIP
I
RUN
TWO
LIGHTS
THE
STANDARD
HEADLAMP
PLUS
A
SIDELAMP
MOUNTED
ON
THE
CRASH
BAR
THE
ILLUMINATIONS
EXCELLENT
THAT
WAY
WITH
A
FULL
BEAM
COMING
OUT
FROM
THE
LEVEL
OF
THE
MOTOR
LEFT
SIDE
THE
LAMP
BEAM
IS
LINEAR
SO
THAT
YOU
GET
A
BRIGHT
STREAK
OF
ILLUMINATION
FROM
LEFT
TO
RIGHT
AND
IT
REALLY
PICKS
UP
THE
PERIPHERY
DEER
LURKING
ETC
COMBINED
WITH
THE
HEADLAMP
ON
HIGH
YOU
CAN
SEE
LIKE
DAY
BUT
IVE
HEARD
THAT
BMW
ALTERNATORS
DONT
CRANK
OUT
TOO
MUCH
DO
I
NEED
TO
SHUT
DOWN
THE
SIDELAMP
WHEN
IM
PUTTERING
AROUND
IN
THE
DIRT
AT
LOW
RPM
PLEASE
POST
IF
YOU
COME
TO
ANY
CONCLUSION
ON
THIS
I
AM
THINKING
OF
PUTTING
A
LIGHT
ON
EACH
CYLINDER
GUARD
ON
MY
AND
WAS
WONDERING
WHETHER
I
WAS
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
SWITCH
LIGHTS

TIME
