says
i
guess
im
out
of
touch
but
what
exactly
is
the
ducati
a
vtwin
desmo
or
is
it
that
halfavtwin
with
the
balance
weight
where
the
cylinder
would
go
a
second
for
a
isnt
bad
at
all
sorry
i
should
have
been
more
specific
the
ss
ran
the
quater
in
the
last
small
vtwin
duc
we
got
in
the
us
and
the
is
a
pantah
based
vtwin
was
the
pantah
and
it
ran
a
creditable
modern
carbs
and
what
not
should
put
the
in
the
high
at
btw
fzr
ran
mid
and
the
latest
crop
of
japanese
will
out
run
that
its
hard
to
remember
but
but
a
new
will
clobber
an
old
handily
both
in
top
end
and
rollon
technology
stands
still
for
noone
not
too
hard
to
remember
i
bought
a
new
in
it
was
place
in
the
speed
wars
behind
the
cbx
xs
eleven
with
a
mile
and
horses
that
wouldnt
even
make
a
good
these
days
then
again
i
paid
for
it
so
technology
isnt
the
only
thing
thats
changed
of
course
id
still
rather
ride
the
old
gs
across
three
states
than
any
of
the
i
guess
its
an
indication
of
how
much
things
have
changed
that
a
second
didnt
seem
too
far
out
of
line
