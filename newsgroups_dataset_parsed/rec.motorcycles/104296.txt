says
yo
did
anybody
see
this
run
of
hard
copy
no
i
dont
watch
that
busht
the
kat
although
not
the
latest
machine
is
still
a
high
performance
machine
and
he
slams
on
the
brakes
of
couse
we
all
know
that
cages
especially
the
ones
with
the
disco
lights
cant
stop
as
fast
as
our
high
performance
machines
so
what
happens
the
cage
plows
into
the
kat
so
does
this
mean
the
cop
is
at
fault
for
rearending
the
bike
you
know
following
too
closely
and
reckless
driving
dod
the
significant
problems
we
face
cannot
be
solved
at
the
same
level
of
thinking
we
were
at
when
we
created
them
