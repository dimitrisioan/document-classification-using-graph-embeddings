the
mother
of
all
locks
on
friday
the
of
april
i
took
possesion
of
a
cobra
links
lock
diameter
this
was
a
special
order
i
weighs
a
lot
i
had
to
carry
it
home
and
it
was
digging
into
my
shoulder
after
about
two
blocks
i
have
currently
a
kryptonite
rock
lock
through
the
front
wheel
a
hd
padlock
for
the
steering
lock
a
master
padlock
to
lock
the
cover
to
two
front
spokes
and
the
cobra
links
through
the
rear
swing
arm
and
around
a
post
in
an
underground
parking
garage

friday
the
i
have
an

installed
on
me
bike
when
i
travel
the
cobra
