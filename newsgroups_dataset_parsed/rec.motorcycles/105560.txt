FUNNY
THING
HAPPENED
AT
THE
DMV
THE
OTHER
DAY
I
SAW
THIS
POSTED
AND
IT
BRINGS
AN
INTERESTING
EVENT
TO
MIND
IN
ARTICLE
MDENNIEXEROXCOM
MATT
DENNIE
WRITES
THE
REACTIONS
OF
LITTLE
BOYS
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
MOST
ENTHUSIASTIC
TO
A
WAVE
AND
ALSO
GOOD
TO
SEE
I
ALWAYS
WAVE
WHEN
I
SEE
A
KID
THAT
HAS
AT
LEAST
NOTICED
MY
BIKE
I
FIGURE
IT
HELPS
THE
FUTURE
OF
THE
SPORT
I
HAVE
TO
ADMIT
THAT
I
USUALLY
TRY
TO
DO
SO
WITHOUT
THE
PARENTAL
FIGURE
NOTICING
IM
AFRAID
THAT
THE
KID
WILL
GET
YELLED
AT
FOR
ASSOCIATIGN
WITH
ANTISOCIETAL
TYPES
LIKE
US
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
I
WAS
IN
THE
DMV
WITH
KEN
I
WAS
STANDING
IN
A
MILE
LONG
LINE
WAITING
FOR
SOME
REALLY
BORED
LOOKING
PERSON
TO
FLEECE
A
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
FROM
SOME
DOUGH
KEN
WAS
SITTING
ON
A
CHAIR
NEXT
TO
OUR
HELMETS
WONDERING
WHY
EVERYBODY
THERE
LOOKED
TO
BE
ABOUT
THE
SOCIAL
CALIBUR
OF
PEOPLE
YOU
WOULD
FIND
AT
A
LAUNDROMAT
WHEN
SOME
YOUNG
WOMAN
WALKED
IN
WHO
REQUIRED
OUR
CONFERRING
ATTENTIONS
HE
CAME
OVER
AND
STOOD
IN
LINE
WITH
ME
WHILE
WE
WATCHED
HER
FILL
OUT
SOME
FORMS
AND
THEN
WE
NOTICED
A
LITTLE
KID
ABOUT
YEARS
OLD
REACH
OVER
THE
BENCH
AND
TOUCH
OUR
HELMETS
ONE
AT
A
TIME
I
DIDNT
PARTICULARLY
MIND
AND
NEITHER
DID
KEN
THAT
THE
KID
WAS
TOUCHING
OUR
HELMETS
THAT
IS
BUT
THE
HELMETS
WERENT
ON
THE
MOST
STABLE
OF
PLATFORMS
SO
KEN
SCOOTED
OVER
THERE
TO
RESETTLE
THEM
AND
AS
SOON
AS
HE
TOUCHED
THE
HELMETS
MOTHER
OF
SAID
CHILD
STARTED
SHRIEKING
AT
HER
KID
YOU
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THOSE
YOU
SHIT
AND
WHOPPED
THE
TYKE
BRUTALLY
ABOUT
THE
HEAD
AND
SHOULDERS
I
SUPPOSE
IT
WAS
OUR
SCARY
SEX
DRUGS
AND
UNIX
TSHIRTS
THAT
SENT
SUCH
BOUTS
OF
TERROR
THROUGH
HER
BODY
