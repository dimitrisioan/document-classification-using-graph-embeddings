is
it
possible
to
do
a
wheelie
on
a
motorcycle
with
shaftdrive
yes
but
the
rear
wheel
comes
off
the
ground
not
the
front
see
it
just
hops
into
the
air
figure
i
know
the
roads
up
there
in
minnesota
are
pretty
bad
but
i
doubt
that
they
are
that
bad
ive
never
realy
tried
to
watch
my
back
tyre
but
my
maxim
will
pull
the
front
wheel
off
the
ground
if
i
pop
the
clutch
admittedly
it
is
easier
with
someone
on
back
maybe
thats
what
keeps
the
rear
tyre
down
