FROM
THE
SUMMARY
IN
THE
BACK
OF
MOTORCYCLIST
THEY
RUN
THE
IN
AT
ABOUT
MPH
INTERESTINGLY
ENOUGH
THIS
WINNEBAGO
OF
BIKES
IS
FASTER
THAN
ANY
OF
THE
HARLEYS
LISTED
IT
DEPRECIATES
MUCH
FASTER

ALL

THE
HIT
THE
TRAPS
AT
ACCORDING
TO
CYCLE
MAGAZINE
YEAH
THEY
DEPRECIATE
FASTER
THAN
HARLEYS
FOR
THE
FIRST
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
THEN
THEY
BOTTOM
OUT
GOT
MY
W
MILES
ON
THE
ODOMETER
FOR
JUST

WOULD
ASK

ABOUT
OF
WHAT
A
NEW
WOULD
COST
THINK
THE
ORIGINALLY
SOLD
FOR
BRAND
NEW
NOT
SURE
IF
THATS
THE
CASE
THEN
IT
DEPRECIATED
OVER
YEARS
OR
A
MERE
BIG
FAT
HAIRY
DEAL
BASED
ON
WHAT
I
KNOW
HARLEYS
TEND
TO
DEPRECIATE
YOUR
MONIES
FAR
MORE
THAN
THE
INITIAL
DEPRECIATION
OF
THE
BIKE
ITSELF
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
PARTS
AND
SERVICE
ALL
THIS
ABOUT
HARLEYS
HOLDING
THEIR
VALUE
BETTER
DOESNT
ALWAYS
WASH
AWAY
THE
KNOCKS
ON

AS
BEING
MUCH
SLOWER
ACCORDING
TO
PETER
EGAN
IN
THE
JUST
RELEASED

WORLD
HIS
FLHS
IS
A
REAL
DOG
WHEN
HE
PILLIONS
HIS
WIFE
ALL
THAT
MONEY
FOR
A
DOG
THAT
DOESNT
DEFECATE
MUCH
