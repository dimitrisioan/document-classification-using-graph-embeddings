blind
driveway
at
mph
for
that
matter
how
many
driveways
are
long
enough
for
a
car
to
hit
mph
by
the
end
i
eagerly
await
comment
well
my
driveway
is
just
keep
an
eye
out
for
the
blue
glh
turbo
that
utilizes
the
hitthegroundrunning
merging
technique
at
least
i
dont
have
a
dog
that
you
need
worry
about
last
week
while
entering
a
sandgravel
covered
intersection
in
the
country
i
caught
something
unkosher
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
you
know
that
disgusting
sensation
when
great
asofyet
unidentified
evil
is
about
to
intimately
acquaint
itself
with
you
kind
of
like
knowing
that
that
darkening
shadow
around
you
just
cannot
possibly
be
anything
even
remotely
good
because
it
probably
has
something
to
do
with
a
boeing
behaving
gravitationally
speaking
much
like
a
brick
negotiating
my
way
into
this
intersection
that
somehow
reminded
me
of
daytona
beach
sans
sun
babes
i
manage
to
get
a
glance
at
my
impending
destiny
lucifers
own
dog
hells
secret
blend
of
canine
doberman
and
rottweiler
it
moved
with
the
grace
of
a
doberman
yet
had
the
hulk
and
jowels
of
the
rottweiler
a
creature
with
a
definite
wrong
end
to
be
at
the
picture
in
my
mirrors
was
fuzzy
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
fangs
and
saliva
trail
to
shorten
a
verbose
tale
my
burly
gaurdianangels
once
again
performed
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
duty
carried
the
bike
through
the
sandtrap
i
honestlyhave
no
idea
how
and
left
the
minion
of
beelzebub
with
a
face
that
suspiciously
resembles
a
metzler
tread
no
blood
though
rats
moral
im
not
really
sure
but
more
and
more
i
believe
that
bikers
ought
to
be
allowed
to
carry
handguns
