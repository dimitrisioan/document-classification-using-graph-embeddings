DRIVER
NEARLY
RAMS
BACK
OF
INNOCENT
BIKER
I
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
THEORETICALLY
STOP
SO
FAR
BEHIND
A
CAR
BUT
CAN
YOU
REALLY
IN
ACTUALITY
AVOID
SUCH
AN
INCIDENT
SUGGESTIONS
GLAD
TO
HEAR
THAT
THE
BOZO
MANAGED
TO
STOP
IVE
ONLY
BEEN
RIDING
FOR
ABOUT
TWO
YEARS
BUT
HERE
ARE
MY
RULES
FOR
TRAFFIC
LIGHT
SURVIVAL
I
TRY
TO
NEVER
STOP
JUST
OVER
A
HILL
BEHIND
A
CAR
IF
I
HAVE
TO
STOP
IN
SUCH
A
LOCATION
I
PULL
ALMOST
COMPLETELY
NEXT
TO
THE
CAR
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
IF
IM
THE
ONLY
ONE
IE
NO
CAR
IN
FRONT
I
TURN
THE
BIKE
SOMEWHAT
SIDEWAYS
ACROSS
THE
LANE
TO
INCREASE
MY
VISIBILITY
TO
ANY
ONCOMING
VEHICLE
MAKE
SURE
TO
KEEP
YOUR
TAILLIGHT
VISIBLE
TO
TRAFFIC
THOUGH
NOTE
MY
BIKE
IS
BRIGHT
WHITE
TURNING
SIDEWAYS
ON
A
BLACK
BIKE
MIGHT
NOT
BE
AS
BENEFICIAL
ON
A
FLAT
ROAD
I
STOP
WITH
A
BIT
OF
ROOM
AHEAD
OF
ME
USUALLY
ABOUT
TWO
OR
THREE
BIKE
LENGTHS
THIS
WILL
HOPEFULLY
GIVE
ME
ROOM
TO
PULL
FORWARD
AND
TO
THE
SIDE
AS
A
CAR
APPROACHES
IF
YOU
ARE
THE
LAST
IN
A
LINE
OF
VEHICLES
WATCH
YOUR
MIRRORS
CONSTANTLY
IF
YOU
SEE
A
VEHICLE
APPROACHING
AND
CANT
SEE
ANY
EVIDENCE
TO
INDICATE
THAT
HESHE
IS
SLOWING
DOWN
GET
OUT
OF
THE
WAY
NOW
FLICKER
YOUR
BRAKE
LIGHT
IF
IM
THE
LAST
VEHICLE
IN
LINE
I
WILL
PULL
AND
RELEASE
THE
BRAKE
AS
A
CAR
APPROACHES
FROM
BEHIND
NOTICED
THE
CAR
BY
WATCHING
MY
MIRRORS
OF
COURSE
I
VARY
THE
SPEED
OF
THE
FLICKER
HOPING
TO
MAKE
THE
CAGER
NOTICE
THAT
THERES
SOMETHING
IN
THE
LANE
AHEAD
OF
HIM
NOW
WITH
ALL
THAT
SAID
ITS
THE
SITUATION
WHERE
YOU
ARE
FIRST
IN
LINE
THAT
I
FEEL
MOST
DEFENSELESS
IF
YOURE
FIRST
IN
LINE
YOUR
FORWARD
ESCAPE
ROUTE
IS
SERIOUSLY
LIMITED
YOU
CAN
ONLY
MOVE
FORWARD
TO
THE
EXTENT
THAT
YOU
DONT
ENTER
THE
INTERSECTION
I
LEAVE
SOME
ROOM
BEHIND
THE
STOP
LINE
ALTHOUGH
AROUND
HERE
THE
LIGHT
ACTIVATORS
ARE
ALWAYS
RIGHT
UP
NEXT
TO
THE
STOP
LINE
AND
WATCH
THE
MIRRORS
I
THINK
IVE
DECIDED
THAT
HOPPING
OFF
THE
BIKE
MIGHT
BE
THE
BEST
WAY
OUT
OF
THIS
SITUATION
ANY
OTHER
IDEAS
FOR
BEING
FIRST
IN
LINE
WITH
NO
TRAFFIC

BEHIND
