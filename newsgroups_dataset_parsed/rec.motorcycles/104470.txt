ultra
sticky
labels
printed
with
your
favourite
curse
are
good
even
our
local
hospitals
use
them
instead
of
wheel
clamps
putting
one
about
size
on
each
window
of
the
cage
an
apartment
complex
where
i
used
to
live
tried
this
only
they
put
the
thing
over
the

window

couldnt

a
friend
damned
near
wrecked
on
the

her
vision
blocked
by
the
sticker
i
suggested
to
the
manager
the
enormous
liability
they
were
assuming
by

would
probably

a
laugh
or

court

found
her
liable
for
serious
be
careful
about
putting
stickers
on
cages
windows
yeah
make
darn
sure
you
cover
all
the
glass
so
the
driver
cant
reasonably
expect
to
be
able
to
drive
with
the
things
on
the
car
