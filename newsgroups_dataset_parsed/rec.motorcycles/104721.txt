SINGLETRACK
SNOW
VEHICLES
WITH
FRONT
SKIS
AND
SNOW
SKIS
ATTACHED
TO
SKIERS
LEGS
DEFORM
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
SNOW
CREATING
THEIR
OWN
BANK
ICE
SKATES
ALTER
THE
PHASE
OF
THE
ICE
AND
ALSO
CARVE
OUT
THEIR
OWN
TRACKS
SO
WHAT
SO
THEY
HAVE
BUGGER
ALL
TO
DO
WITH
MOTORCYCLES
HENCE
ANY
APPARENT
SIMILARITY
IN
HANDLING
CHARACTERISTICS
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
BE
ANALAGOUS
IN
ITS
UNDERLYING
PHYSICS
TO
THAT
BEHIND
MOTORCYCLE
HANDLING
CHARACTERISTICS
OK
AS
ONE
LAST
ATTEMPT
ILL
TAKE
A
DIFFERENT
TACK
WE
ALL
SEEM
TO
BE
IN
AGREEMENT
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
EXPLANATIONS
FOR
WHY
ONE
CAN
USE
THE
HANDLEBARS
TO
LEAN
A
MOVING
MOTORCYCLE
THE
QUESTION
IS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
EFFECT
DOMINANT
AND
WHICH
ONE
IS
IT
THE
IDEA
WOULD
BE
TO
DESIGN
AN
EXPERIMENT
WHICH
WOULD
SEAPRATE
THE
TWO
CHARACTERISTICS
AND
SEE
WHICH
EFFECT
PRODUCES
A
SIMILAR
RESULT
TO
THE
ONE
WITH
WHICH
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
HAVE
BIKES
ARE
FAMILIAR
LETS
LOOK
AT
THE
ONE
THAT
SO
FAR
HAS
SPARKED
NO
CONTROVERSY
ON
ITS
OWN
GYROSCOPIC
PRECESSION
TO
EXAMINE
THIS
ALONE
WE
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GET
RID
OF
THE
CONTACT
PATCH
EFFECT
BY
NOT
ALLOWING
THE
CONTACT
PATCHES
TO
TRANSMIT
ANY
FORCE
THE
WHEELS
AND
STEERING
MECHANISM
WOULD
HAVE
TO
REMAIN
AND
BE
ATTACHED
TO
A
VEHICLE
WITH
ABOUT
THE
SAME
WEIGHT
AS
A
BIKE
THROUGH
SUSPENSION
SO
THAT
THE
WHEELS
TRANSMIT
FORCES
TO
THE
BIKE
THE
SAME
WAY
SIMILAR
TO
A
BIKES
AN
EXPERIMENT
WOULD
BE
TO
RIDE
A
BIKE
ALONG
A
DRY
ROAD
TO
GET
MOVING
AND
TO
GET
THE
WHEELS
SPINNING
THEN
CHANGE
SURFACES
TO
SOMETHING
THAT
WONT
TRANSMIT
FORCES
THROUGH
THE
CONTACT
PATCHES
AND
TRY
A
STEERING
MANOEUVRE
TO
SEE
IF
THE
BIKE
LEANS
IT
PROBABLY
WOULD
SINCE
SOME
OF
US
KNOW
HOW
EASY
IT
IS
TO
FALL
DOWN
ON
ICE
BUT
WE
WOULDNT
GET
A
GOOD
IDEA
OF
HOW
WELL
OR
WHAT
IT
FEELS
LIKE
BECAUSE
WITHOUT
THE
CONTACT
PATCHES
WE
CANT
TURN
MAYBE
THERES
A
BETTER
WAY
BESIDES
EVEN
ICE
DOESNT
GET
RID
OF
THE
CONTACT
PATCH
FORCES
ALTOGETHER
SO
WED
HAVE
TO
FIND
A
REALLY
FRICTIONLESS
SURFACE
YOUD
HAVE
TO
TRY
IT
AGAIN
WITH
THE
WHEELS
LOCKED
TO
REALLY
KNOW
IF
IT
WAS
THE
ROTATION
THAT
DID
IT
LOOKING
AT
THE
CONTACTPATCH
EFFECT
ONLY
HOWEVER
IS
FAIRLY
SIMPLE
NOW
WE
HAVE
TO
FIND
A
VEHICLE
THAT
GETS
THE
ABOUT
THE
SAME
MAGNITUDE
AND
DIRECTION
OF
CANTACT
PATCH
FORCES
AS
A
MOTORCYCLE
AND
TRANSMITS
THEM
ABOUT
THE
SAME
WAY
TO
THE
VEHICLE
BUT
WITHOUT
ROTATING
WHEELS
HOW
IT
GETS
THE
CONTACT
PATCH
FORCES
IS
IRRELEVANT
WERE
JUST
LOOKING
FOR
SOMETHING
THAT
HAS
CONTACT
PATCHES
THAT
CAN
GO
STRAIGHT
AND
NOT
SIDEWAYS
AND
SKIS
OR
SKATES
WOULD
DO
FINE
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
ANY
SNOWSKI
OR
SKATE
BIKES
BUT
UP
HERE
WE
HAVE
THE
SUZUKI
WETBIKE
THAT
IS
ARRANGED
LIKE
A
MOTORCYCLE
BUT
HAS
FAT
WATER
SKIS
WHERE
THERE
SHOULD
BE
WHEELS
I
THINK
THE
PROPELLOR
IS
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
REAR
SKI
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
BUT
WE
COULD
TRY
IT
AT
A
COAST
TO
GET
RID
OF
MOST
OF
ITS
EFFECT
NOW
I
ADMIT
THAT
THIS
IS
SECOND
HAND
INFO
ALTHOUGH
ID
LOVE
TO
TRY
ONE
OF
THESE
BUT
THE
REVIEW
IN
THE
LOCAL
CYCLE
RAG
AND
A
GUY
IN
A
BIKE
SHOP
THAT
SELLS
THEM
BOTH
SAY
THAT
THIS
MACHINE
HANDLES
VERY
MUCH
LIKE
A
MOTORCYCLE
IN
THAT
YOU
COUNTERSTEER
IT
TO
TURN
SO
WE
HAVE
CONTACT
PATCHES
THAT
TRANSMIT
SIMILAR
FORCES
TO
A
BIKES
A
SIMILAR
SUSPENSION
ARRANGEMENT
AND
NO
GYROSCOPES
BUT
WE
DO
HAVE
COUNTERSTEERING
CONCLUSION
YOU
DONT
NEED
GYROSCOPES
TO
COUNTERSTEER
VEHICLES
THAT
HAVE
MOTORCYCLELIKE
CONTACT
PATCH
ARRANGEMENTS
WE
STILL
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
REAL
EFFECT
THE
GYROSCOPES
HAVE
WHEN
THEYRE
THERE
BUT
FROM
MY
OBSERVATIONS
OF
HOW
HANDLEBAR
ANGLE
FORCE
ETC
RELATE
TO
STEERING
IN
GENERAL
IM
WILLING
TO
BET
THAT
THEYRE
NOT
THE
DOMINANT
FACTOR
IN
COUNTERSTEERING
IF
YOU
DONT
LIKE
THIS
CONCLUSION
THEN
DONT
ACCEPT
IT
BUT
MY
MOTORCYCLES
BEHAVIOUR
IS
CONSISTENT
WITH
IT
IF
SOMEONE
CAN
PROVE
OTHERWISE
GO
AHEAD
IVE
