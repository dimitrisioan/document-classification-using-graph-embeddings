IT
IS
THE

OF

THE

AND
THE

OF
THE

DICTATE
HOW
QUICKLY
YOU
CAN

TO

AND

THE

ARE

SERIOUSLY
MJSSUGGESTING

THE
ANSWER
IS
ABSOLUTELY
AS

SO
ELOQUENTLY
DESCRIBES
EDPUT
TWO
RIDERS

MACHINES
ITS
THE

WHO
KNOWS
WHAT

DOING
AND
WHY
THAT
WILL
BE
FASTER
IT
MAY
EDBE

TO
IMPROVE
YOUR
TECHNIQUE
IF
YOU
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHAT
IT
IS
EDTHROUGH
TRIAL
AND

IT
IS
NOT
VERY

METHODOLOGY
EDONLY
BY
UNDERSTANDING
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
STEERING
A

TO

KINDLY
NOTE
THE

IN
THE
RESPONSES
ED
AND
I
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
KNOWING
RIDING
TECHNIQUE
WHILE
MIKE
IS
ARGUING
KNOWING
THE
PHYSICS
BEHIND
IT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
TAUGHT
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
IE
PUSH
THE
BAR
ON
THE
INSIDE
OF
THE

TO
GO
THAT
WAY
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
LEARN
ALL
THE
FIZZIKS
ABOUT
GYROSCOPES
AND
ICE
CREAM
CONES
AND
SUCH
AS
SEEN
IN
THE
PARALLEL
THREAD
THAT
STUFF
IS
MAINLY
OF
INTEREST
TO
TECHNOMOTORCYCLE
GEEKS
LIKE
THE
READERS
OF
RECMOTORCYCLES
BUT
DOESNT
NEED
TO
BE
TAUGHT
TO
THE
AVERAGE
STUDENT
LEARNING
CSTEERING
MIKE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
THE
DISTINCTION
I
KNOW
PEOPLE
WHO

WHO
COULDNT

I
KNOW
VERY
INTELLIGENT
WELLEDUCATED
PEOPLE
WHO
THINK
THAT

STEER

BY
EITHER
LEANING

OR
A
