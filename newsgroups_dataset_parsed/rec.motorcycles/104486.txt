WRITES
ALL
OF
US
THAT
ARGUE
ABOUT
GYROSCOPES
ETC
THROUGHLY
UNDERSTAND
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
INCLUDING
ALL
THE
ONES
WHO
THINK
THAT
THEY
COUNTERSTEER
ALL
THE
WAY
THROUGH
A
CORNER
THE
UNDERLYING
PHYSICS
ARE
A
DIFFERENT
MATTER
AND
NEED
NOT
BE
TAUGHT
TO
BEGINNERS
AGREED
COUNTERSTEERING
THE
TECHNIQUE
SHOULD
BE
TAUGHT
FOR
ONLY
WITH
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
TECHNIQUE
CAN
ONE
DEVELOP
MAXIMALLY
EFFECTIVE
EMERGENCY
AVOIDANCE
MANUVERS
THIS
IS
REALLY
THE
ONLY
THING
WE
DISAGREE
ON
MAYBE
WE
SHOULD
AGREE
TO
DISAGREE
I
STILL
THINK
THAT
TELLING
NEWBIES
TO
STEER
LEFT
TO
TURN
TO
THE
RIGHT
IS
UNNECESSARILY
CONFUSING
WHEN
THEYLL
DO
IT
ANYWAY
IF
THEY
JUST
GET
ON
THE
BIKE
AND
RIDE
THE
DAMN
THING
I
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHATS
HAPPENING
ITS
THOSE
OTHER
GITS
THAT
HAVENT
A
CLUE
ME
TOO
UNDERSTANDING
THE
PHYSICS
OF
TRACTION
IS
FINE
BUT
I
CANNOT
SEE
HOW
DETAILED
THEORY
LIKE
THAT
HAS
ANY
PLACE
IN
A
MOTORCYLE
TRAINING
COURSE
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
KNOW
IS
THAT
MAXIMUM
TRACTION
IS
OBTAINED
WITH
THE
TYRE
JUST
BEGINNING
TO
SLIDE
AGAINST
THE
ROAD
THEN
WE
ARE
IN
VIOLENT
DISAGREEMENT
WHILE
WHAT
YOU
STATE
IS
TRUE
IT
IS
INSUFFICIENT
TO
FORM
A
TRACTION
MANAGEMENT
POLICY
AVAILABLE
TRACTION
INCREASES
WITH
APPLIED
NORMAL
FORCE
IE
TRACTION
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
FRONT
WHEEL
INCREASES
AS
WEIGHT
SHIFTS
UNDER
BRAKING
FORCES
AND
CORRESPONDINGLY
DECREASES
AT
THE
REAR
THUS
A
TECHNIQUE
OF
APPLYING
BOTH
BRAKES
AND
EASING
OFF
THE
REAR
AND
INCREASING
PRESSURE
ON
THE
FRONT
CAN
BEST
BE
LEARNED
WITH
AN
UNDERSTANDING
OF
WEIGHT
SHIFT
AND
AVAILABLE
TRACTION
JEEZ
ED
WHEN
YOU
STARTED
TALKING
ABOUT
TRACTION
MANAGEMENT
POLICIES
I
THOUGHT
YOU
WERE
MAKING
SOME
WEIRD
REFERENCE
TO
LOOKING
AFTER
RAILWAY
LOCOMOTIVES
THE
OFFICIAL
LINE
HERE
THOUGH
I
DO
HAVE
MY
DOUBTS
ABOUT
IT
IS
THAT
THE
FRONT
BRAKE
IS
APPLIED
FIRST
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
REAR
BRAKE
THE
IDEA
BEING
THAT
YOU
AVOID
LOCKING
UP
THE
REAR
AFTER
WEIGHT
TRANSFER
TAKES
PLACE
IN
PRACTICE
I
SUSPECT
MOST
PEOPLE
DO
WHAT
YOU
DESCRIBE
SAYING
BRAKE
UNTIL
THE
TIRE
JUST
BEGINS
TO
SLIDE
IS
NEXT
TO
USELESS
ADVICE
TO
A
NEWBIE
HE
HAS
TO
GO
OUT
AND
SLIDE
THE
TIRE
TO
FIND
OUT
WHERE
THAT
IS
IT
ALSO
GIVES
HIM
ZERO
INFORMATION
FROM
WHICH
TO
DEVELOP
A
BRAKING
TECHNIQUE
THAT
CHANGES
AS
THE
BRAKING
AND
CORRESPONDING
WEIGHT
SHIFT
DEVELOP
IF
YOU
DONT
SLIDE
THE
TYRE
YOU
HAVE
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
WHETHER
YOUVE
ACHIEVED
MAXIMUM
BRAKING
OR
NOT
IM
NOT
SUGGESTING
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
ALWAYS
AIM
TO
BRAKE
AS
HARD
AS
YOU
POSSIBLY
CAN
BUT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
FIND
THE
LIMITS
OF
THE
MACHINE
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
BEYOND
THEM
IN
ANY
CASE
FOR
MAXIMUM
BRAKING
IF
AS
I
SUGGESTED
YOU
AIM
TO
KEEP
BOTH
WHEELS
JUST
ON
THE
POINT
OF
SLIDING
THEN
YOULL
BE
DOING
EXACTLY
AS
YOU
SUGGEST
