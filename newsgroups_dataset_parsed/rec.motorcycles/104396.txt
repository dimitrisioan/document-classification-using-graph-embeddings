moisten
a

apply
some
rubbing
compound
and
work
into
the
translucent
previously
transparent
material
after
a
few
minutes
of
working
on
the
plastic
face
the
dial
or
plastic
face
will
be
clear
once
more
will
not
work
for
glass
btw
i
am
not
responsible
for
damages
incurred
when
using
the
above
method
most
models
can
use
the
treatment
safely
