ducati
are
really
slow
they
dont
sell
them
over
here
in
us
but
considering
that
the
is
not
too
powerful
the
is
gonna
be
a
dog
oh
yeah
at
mph
in
the
quarter
is
such
a
slug
come
on
when
was
the
last
time
you
used
your
max
power
peak
i
think
maybe
you
should
ride
one
first
before
passing
judgement
there
is
a
lot
more
than
just
maximum
acceleration
i
guess
im
out
of
touch
but
what
exactly
is
the
ducati
a
vtwin
desmo
or
is
it
that
halfavtwin
with
the
balance
weight
where
the
cylinder
would
go
a
second
for
a
isnt
bad
at
all
sorry
i
should
have
been
more
specific
the
ss
ran
the
quater
in
the
last
small
vtwin
duc
we
got
in
the
us
and
the
is
a
pantah
based
vtwin
was
the
pantah
and
it
ran
a
creditable
modern
carbs
and
what
not
should
put
the
in
the
high
at
btw
fzr
ran
mid
and
the
latest
crop
of
japanese
will
out
run
that
its
hard
to
remember
but
but
a
new
will
clobber
an
old
handily
both
in
