okay
doders
heres
a
goddamn
mystery
for
ya
oh
goody
i
love
a
puzzle
watson
the
games
afoot
today
i
was
turning
a
degree
corner
just
like
on
any
other
day
but
there
was
a
slight
difference
a
rough
spot
right
in
my
path
caused
the
suspension
to
compress
in
mid
corner
and
some
part
of
the
bike
hit
the
ground
with
a
very
tangible
thunk
i
pulled
over
at
first
opportunity
to
sus
out
the
damage
stuff
deleted
okay
all
you
engineering
types
how
the
fk
do
you
explain
this
how
can
you
rip
a
tightly
fitting
steel
thread
out
of
a
threaded
hole
in
alloy
without
damaging
the
thread
in
the
hole
is
this
some
sort
of
hitech
design
thingo
let
me
guess
you
were
making
a
left
turn
correct
the
edge
of
the
stud
contacting
the
road
caused
it
to
turn
and
unthread
itself
if
you
had
been
making
a
right
turn
it
would
have
tightened
the
stud
