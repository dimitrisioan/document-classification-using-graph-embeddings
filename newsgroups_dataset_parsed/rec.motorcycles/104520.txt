HELP
IVE
GOT
A
FRIEND
SHOPPING
FOR
HER
FIRST
MOTORCYCLE
THIS
IS
GREAT
UNFORTUNATELY
SHE
NEEDS
AT
MOST
A
SEAT
THIS
IS
NOT
GREAT
SO
FAR
THE
ONLY
THING
WEVE
FOUND
WAS
AN
OLD
AND
UNHAPPYLOOKING
SO
ITS
TIME
TO
TAP
THE
COLLECTIVE
MEMORY
OF
ALL
THE
DENIZENS
OUT
THERE
ANYBODY
KNOW
OF
MODELS
OLD
MODELS
AND
USED
BIKES
ARE
NOT
A
PROBLEM
WITH
A
OR
LOWER
SEAT
AND
SINCE
SHE
HAS
TO
MAKE
THIS
DIFFICULT
SHE
WOULD
PREFER
NOT
TO
END
UP
WITH
A
CRUISER
SO
THERES
BONUS
POINTS
FOR
LISTING
TINY
STANDARDS
I
SEEM
TO
REMEMBER
A
THREAD
WITH
A
POINT
SIMILAR
TO
THIS
PASSING
THROUGH
SEVERAL
MONTHS
AGO
DID
