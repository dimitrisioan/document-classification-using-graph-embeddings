what
is
a

rule
of
thumb
for
sobriety
and
cycling
couple
hours
after
you
feel
sober
what
or
should
i
just
work
with
if
i
drink
tonight
i
dont
ride
until
tomorrow
hrdrink

for
the
rest
i
took
an
alcohol
servers
class
a
few
years
ago
what
the
hey
my
employer
paid
for
it
we
were
told
that
the
drink
hour
rule
was
written
with
proof
booze
and
a
pound
person
in
mind
drinking
cuervo
gold
weighing
in
i
obviously
will
get
drunk
faster
than
the
theoretical
person
mentioned
above
worse
imagine
rum
coke
made
with
bacardi
mind
you
all
thats
for
getting
too
drunk
to
drive
a
car
i
may
only
have
been
riding
for
a
month
or
so
but
i
plan
my
evenings
with
a
very
rigid
exclusive
or
statement
either
dont
drink
or
dont
ride
pretty
simple
these
are
fairly
cautious
guidelines
and
will
work
even
if
you
happen
to
have
a
low
tolerance
or
body
mass
i
think
the
cops
and
dont
you
dare
drink
drive
tm
commercials
will
usually
say
in
general
but
after
about
drinks
and
hrs
you
could
very
well
be
over
the
legal
limit
watch
yourself
mike
sorry
mike
i
have
to
believe
that
that
policy
works
best
as
fertilizer
even
if
all
you
plan
to
do
is
drive
home
nice
and
safe
in
your
cage
