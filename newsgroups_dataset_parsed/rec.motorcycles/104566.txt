im
thinking
of
buying
a
motorcycle
whenever
i
tell
people
this
i
usually
get
an
answer
like
why
do
you
want
to
do
that
my
brother
sister
cousin
knows
somebody
who
had
a
motorcycle
and
now
they
are
brain
dead
as
a
result
of
an
accident
so
the
question
i
have
is
how
dangerous
is
riding
its
exactly
as
dangerous
as
it
looks
youre
hard
to
see
and
have
little
protection
keeping
out
of
trouble
means
knowing
your
limits
keeping
your
machine
in
good
shape
and
being
able
to
predict
and
make
up
for
every
stupid
move
that
drivers
make
out
there
we
deal
with
it
because
its
fun
but
staying
alive
takes
a
conscious
effort
ive
bike
like
