BILL
KETZEBACK
WRITES
ANY
LOCK
INCLUDING
THE
KYPTONITE
UTYPES
ARE
EASY
TO
BREAK
INTO
IF
THE
PERSON
HAS
THE
PROPER
SUPPLIES
ANDOR
MOTIVATION
MINUTES
AND
YOUR
BIKE
IS
GONE
I
WOULD
BE
GLAD
TO
EXPLAIN
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
CONTRIBUTE
TO
ANY
UNLAWFUL
ACTIVITIES
DOES
THIS
MAKE
ANYONES
SKEPTIC
ALARM
TM
GO
OFF
NO
OFFENSE
BILL
I
DONT
MEAN
TO
SAY
THAT
YOURE
NOT
BEING
STRAIGHT
BUT
I
WONDER
HOW
YOU
KNOW
ABOUT
THIS
HAVE
YOU
ACTUALLY
EVERY
USED
YOUR
SECRET
METHOD
TO
BREAK
ALL
THE
DIFFERENT
KINDS
OF
BIKE
LOCKS
OR
ARE
YOU
TAKING
SOMEONES
WORD
FOR
IT
THE
FACT
IS
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
SOMEONE
READING
ANYTHING
HERE
IS
GOING
TO
GO
INTO
A
SUCCESSFUL
BIKESTEALING
BUSINESS
BECAUSE
THEY
READ
ANYTHING
IN
RECMOTORCYCLES
SO
PLEASE
TELL
US
WHAT
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
WE
CANT
EVEN
PROTECT
AGAINST
AN
ASSAULT
OR
DISCUSS
METHODS
IF
YOU
DONT
COME
OUT
WITH
IT
SEE
I
HAVE
HEARD
THE
ONES
ABOUT
THE
PIPES
AND
THE
LIQUID
NITROGEN
AND
THE
CORDLESS
DREMEL
TOOLS
AND
A
BUNCH
OF
OTHER
ONES
THE
MOST
PLAUSABLE
METHOD
I
AM
NOT
A
BIKE
THIEF
SO
I
REALLY
DONT
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
IS
JUST
TO
PUT
A
ROD
THROUGH
EACH
WHEEL
AND
USE
FOUR
GUYS
TO
JUST
LIFT
THE
BIKE
INTO
A
TRUCK
THIS
WORKS
BECAUSE
MOST
PEOPLE
DONT
LOCK
THEIR
BIKES
TO
ANYTHING
SINCE
THAT
METHOD
IS
SO
CHILDISHLY
EASY
I
FIGURE
A
NICE
VISIBLE
CHAIN
OR
CABLE
LOCKING
THE
BIKE
TO
SOMETHING
IS
LIKELY
TO
MAKE
A
LAZY
THIEF
GO
ON
TO
THE
NEXT
BIKE
HEY
FINALLY
AN
ADVANTAGE
TO
THE
WEIGHT
AND
HIGH
CG
OF
THE
CONCOURS
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
I
HAVE
A
BIKE
THAT
I
WOULD
HATE
TO
SEE
RIPPED
OFF
BY
SUCH
A
TRIVAL
TACTIC
WARNING
NO
LOCK
ALONE
IS
A
SAFE
DETERENT
AGAINST
THEFT
THE
THIEF
DOESNT
NEED
TO
BE
A
LOCKSMITH
OR
A
LOCKPICKER
TO
WALK
AWAY
WITH
YOUR
PROPERTY
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
MOTION
ALARMS
IN
COMBINATION
TO
A
LOCK
OF
THIS
TYPE
IS
THE
WAY
TO
GO
IF
IN
FACT
YOU
ARE
THAT
CONCERNED
WHAT
TACTIC
ARE
YOU
REFERRING
TO
IF
WE
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
WE
CANT
VERY
WELL
GUARD
AGAINST
IT
CAN
WE
FOR
MY
MONEY
LITERALLY
I
RELY
ON
A
COMBINATION
OF
A
MOTIONDETECTOR
ALARM
WITH
PAGER
WHEN
IM
OUT
OF
EARSHOT
OF
THE
BIKE
IN
A
QUESTIONABLE
AREA
CC
INSURANCE
AND
I
TRY
TO
PARK
IN
OBVIOUS
VISIBLE
AREAS
WITH
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
ABOUT
SEE
IF
SOMEONE
JUST
PLAYS
WITH
THE
BIKE
WITHOUT
INTENTION
OF
STEALING
IT
AT
LEAST
SOME
EYES
ARE
ON
IT
AND
IF
THEY
GET
TOO
RAMBUNCTIOUS
THEYLL
SET
OFF
THE
ALARM
THATS
FOR
A
NICE
BIKE
FOR
A
RATBIKE
THE
TRICK
IS
TO
ALWAYS
KEEP
ITS
ACTUAL
VALUE
WELL
BELOW
BLUEBOOK
SO
THAT
IT
LOOKS
SO
CRAPPY
NOBODY
WOULD
WANT
TO
STEAL
IT
AND
EVEN
IF
THEY
WERE
STUPID
ENOUGH
TO
YOU
WOULD
MAKE
A
PROFIT
ON
THE
DEAL
SERIOUSLY
IF
I
FOR
INSTANCE
NEED
TO
GO
ON
A
BUSINESS
TRIP
FOR
A
WEEK
AND
SADLY
HAVE
TO
LEAVE
THE
BIKES
SITTING
THEY
BOTH
GET
A
SHITTYLOOKING
BUT
USEABLE
COVER
LOCKED
ON
AND
BOTH
BIKES
LOCKED
TO
EACH
OTHER
AND
A
CURB
BUMPER
IN
THE
PARKING
LOT
UNDER
THE
LIGHT
I
USUALLY
RIG
THE
CABLE
LOCKS
I
USE
AIRCRAFT
CABLE
SO
THAT
IF
ANYONE
PULLS
ON
EITHER
BIKE
OR
THE
CABLE
JOINING
THEM
THE
CONCOURS
ALARM
GOES
OFF
AND
I
HAVE
A
FRIEND
COME
BUY
EVERY
DAY
TO
HAVE
A
LOOK
AND
MAKE
SURE
THEYRE
STILL
THERE
THE
ONLY
THING
I
HAVE
EVER
HAD
STOLEN
WAS
A
COVER
AND
THAT
WAS
OVER
WINTER
STORAGE
WITH
THE
BATTERY
OUT
OF
THE
BIKE
AND
THUS
NO
ALARM
OH
PUT
YOUR
OWN
EYELETS
INTO
THE
COVER
FOR
THE
LOCKS
TO
PASS
THROUGH
AND
PLACE
THEM
SO
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
ABSOLUTELY
DESTROY
THE
COVER
TO
GET
IT
OFF
THATS
THE
BEST
THAT
I
CAN
THINK
OF
MOST
OF
THE
LOCKS
I
SEE
PEOPLE
PUT
ON
BIKES
LOOK
WELL
NOT
TOO
MECHANICALLY
SOUND
I
LIKE
ABUS
SINCE
I
HAVE
PERSONALLY
REMOVED
