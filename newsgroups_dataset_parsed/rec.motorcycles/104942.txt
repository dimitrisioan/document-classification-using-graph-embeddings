its
nothing
compared
to
the
ahem
unique
helmet
cbddesign
seen
in
the
new
animated
series
it
has
a
huge
opening
for
his
cbdmouth
topped
by
the
worlds
tiniest
eyeslits
above
the
enormous
mouth
cbdopening
batmans
helmet
probably
cuts
you
down
to
about
degrees
of
cbdunrestricted
vision
with
a
helmet
like
this
he
might
just
be
better

batman
doesnt
need
to
see
hes
batman
cbddid
you
notice
he
only
takes
the
bike
out
in
the
snow
or
rain
so
lets
see
what
we
have
on
the
batdude
so
far
he
has
a
weird
helmet
he
drags
his
knee
in
corners
thanks
cookson
but
how
does
he
do
it
hidden
batpucks
and
he
only
takes
the
bike
out
in
the
snow
or
rain
also
he
lets
robin
ride
i
think
i
could
have
used
a
batmom
would
have
made
getting
my
license
a
lot
easier
theres
a
trend
here
stylish
helmet
stylish
kneedragging
rides
only
in
stylish
cartoon
precipitation
hmm
could
it
be
that
were
dealing
with
a
veritable
airborne
mammalian
poseur
dare
i
say
it
a
batsquid
huh
batsquid
it
all
adds
up
now
lets
make
the
bman
an
honorary
dod
dude
all
he
needs
is
a
dod
sticker
actually
anyone
have
an
address
for
batmans
current
artists
both
comic
book
and
animated
series
well
write
and
ask
if
batman
would
like
to
become
an
honorary
denizen
yeah
special
to
the
kotl
is
there
a
precedent
for
inducting
an
imaginary
member
with
an
imaginary
motorcycle
having
seen
the
computers
in
the
batcave
i
think
we
can
safely
assume
that
he
also
has
imaginary
internet
access
