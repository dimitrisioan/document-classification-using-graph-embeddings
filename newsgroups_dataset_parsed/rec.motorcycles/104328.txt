RE
DRINKING
AND
RIDING
PERSONALLY
I
FOLLOW
THE
NO
ALCOHOL
RULE
WHEN
IM
ON
A
BIKE
MY
VIEW
IS
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
IN
SUCH
A
HIGH
DEGREE
OF
CONTROL
THAT
ANY
ALCOHOL
COULD
BE
POTENTIALLY
HAZARDOUS
TO
MY
BIKE
IF
I
GET
HURT
ITS
MY
OWN
FAULT
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
WRECK
MY
KATANA
I
DEVELOPED
THIS
PHILOSOPHY
FROM
AN
IMPROMPTU
EXPERIMENT
I
HAD
ONE
BEER
AT
IN
THE
EVENING
AND
HAD
VOLLEYBALL
PRACTICE
AT
I
WASNT
EVEN
CLOSE
TO
LEAGLE
INTOXICATION
BUT
I
COULDNT
PERFORM
EVEN
THE
MOST
BASIC
THINGS
UNTIL
THIS
MADE
ME
THINK
ABOUT
HOW
I
VIEWED
ALCOHOL
AND
INTOXICATION
YOU
MAY
SEEM
FINE
BUT
YOUR
REACTIONS
MAY
BE
AFFECTED
SUCH
THAT
YOULL
BE
UNABLE
TO
RECOVER
FROM
HITTING
A
ROCK
OR
EVEN
JUST
A
GUST
OF
WIND
I
GREATLY
ENJOY
SOCIAL
DRINKING
BUT
FOR
ME
IT
JUST
DOESNT
MIX
WITH
RIDING
MAX
ENJOYMENT
