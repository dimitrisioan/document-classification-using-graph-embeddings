MCKEON
WRITES
IN
HEAVY
TRAFFIC
I
SLOW
DOWN
A
BIT
MOSTLY
SO
I
HAVE
MORE
BUFFER
ZONE
IN
FRONT
TO
BALANCE
THE
MINIMAL
BUFFER
BEHIND
BUT
I
ALSO
OFTEN
FIND
THAT
THE
JERK
BEHIND
WILL
NOTICE
TRAFFIC
MOVING
FASTER
IN
OTHER
LANES
SWITCH
INTO
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
PASS
ME
WHICH
IS
FINE
BECAUSE
THEN
I
CAN
KEEP
A
BETTER
EYE
ON
THE
JERK
FROM
BEHIND
WHILE
LOOKING
AHEAD
RATHER
THAN
FROM
IN
FRONT
WHILE
SPLITTING
MY
ATTENTION
BETWEEN
AHEAD
AND
THE
MIRRORS
THIS
IS
PRETTY
DAMNED
COMPLICATED
I
JUST
MAKE
A
BACK
OFF
MOTION
WITH
MY
HANDARM
AND
THE
SECOND
OR
THIRD
TIME
EVEN
THE
MOST
BRAINDEAD
CAGER
BACKS
OFF
IF
THEY
DONT
BACK
OFF
THEN
I
FIND
A
WAY
TO
GET
THE
HELL
OUT
OF
THERE
THE
CAGER
IS
EITHER
PSYCHOTIC
DRUNK
OR
JUST
A
COMPLETE
ASSHOLE
IN
ANY
CASE
I
DONT
WANT
TO
BE
ANYWHERE
NEAR
AND
ESPECIALLY
NOT
IN
FRONT
