cb
dont
be
so
stupid
as
to
leave
your
helmet
on
the
seat
where
it
can
cb
fall
down
and
go
boom

another
good
place
for
your
helmet
is
your
mirror
i
kid
you
not
this
is
very
bad
advice
helmets
have
two
major
impact
absorbing
layers
a
hard
outer
shell
and
a
closedcell
foam
impact
layer
most
helmets
lose
their
protective
properties
because
the
inner
liner
compacts
over
time
long
before
the
outer
shell
is
damaged
or
delaminates
from
age
dr
hurt
tested
helmets
for
many
years
following
his
landmark
study
and
has
estimated
that
a
helmet
can
lose
up
to
of
its
effectiveness
from
inner
liner
compression
i
have
a
video
he
produced
that
discusses
this
phenomenon
in
detail
puncture
compression
of
the
type
caused
by
mirrors
sissy
bars
and
other
relatively
sharp
objects
is
the
worst
offender
even
when
the
comfort
liner
is
unaffected
dents
and
holes
in
the
foam
can
seriously
degrade
the
effectiveness
of
a
helmet
if
you
are
in
the
habit
of
parking
your
lid
on
the
mirrors
i
suggest
you
look
under
the
comfort
liner
at
the
condition
of
the
foam
if
it
is
significantly
damaged
or
missing
replace
the
helmet
