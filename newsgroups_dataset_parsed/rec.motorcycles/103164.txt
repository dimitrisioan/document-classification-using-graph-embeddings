nothing
personal
but
i
object
to
the
we
all
in
that
statement
i
was
on
many
of
those
rides
that
alan
is
describing
pushing
the
envelope
does
not
necessarily
equal
taking
insane
chances
moreover
if
two
riders
are
riding
together
at
the
same
speed
one
might
be
riding
well
beyond
his
abilities
and
the
other
may
have
a
safety
margin
left
oh
come
on
phil
youre
an
excellent
rider
but
you
still
take
plenty
of
chances
dont
tell
me
that
its
just
your
skill
that
keeps
you
from
getting
wacked
theres
a
lot
of
luck
thrown
in
there
too
youre
a
very
good
rider
and
a
very
lucky
one
too
hope
your
luck
holds
allan
i
know
the
circumstances
of
several
of
your
falls
on
the
ride
when
you
fell
while
i
was
next
behind
you
you
made
an
error
of
judgement
by
riding
too
fast
when
you
knew
the
road
was
damp
and
you
reacted
badly
when
you
were
surprised
by
an
oncoming
car
that
crash
was
due
to
factors
that
were
subject
to
your
control
i
wont
deny
that
theres
a
combination
of
luck
and
skill
involved
for
each
of
us
but
it
seems
that
youre
blaming
bad
luck
for
more
of
your
own
pain
than
is
warranted
