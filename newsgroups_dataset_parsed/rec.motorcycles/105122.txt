is
it
possible
to
do
a
wheelie
on
a
motorcycle
with
shaftdrive
no
mike
it
is
imposible
due
to
the
shaft
effect
the
centripital
effects
of
the
rotating
shaft
counteract
any
tendency
for
the
front
wheel
to
lift
off
the
ground
well
my
last
two
motorcycles
have
been
shaft
driven
and
they
will
wheelie
the
rear
gear
does
climb
the
ring
gear
and
lift
the
rear
which
gives
an
odd
feel
but
it
still
wheelies
feeding
frenzy
ah
tis
april
in
recmoto
and
the
newbies
are
bitin
catch
all
you
want
well
make
more
