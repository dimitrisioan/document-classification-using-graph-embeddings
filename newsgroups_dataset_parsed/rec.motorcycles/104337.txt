MARK
N
BRICKER
WROTE
I
AM
IN
THE
MARKET
FOR
A
BIKE
AND
HAVE
RECENTLY
FOUND
A
HONDA
VRF
AT
A
DEALERSHIP
THE
BIKE
HAS
ABOUT
MILES
AND
IS
AROUND
IT
HAS
HAD
TWO
PREVIOUS
OWNERS
BOTH
EMPLOYEES
OF
THE
DEALERSHIP
WHO
I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
TOOK
VERY
GOOD
CARE
OF
THE
BIKE
I
HAVE
TWO
QUESTIONS
IS
THIS
TOO
MANY
MILES
FOR
A
BIKE
I
KNOW
THIS
WOULD
NOT
BE
MANY
MILES
FOR
A
CAR
BUT
I
AM
UNFAMILIAR
WITH
THE
LIFE
SPAN
OF
BIKES
IS
THIS
A
DECENT
PRICE
I
AM
ALSO
UNFAMILAR
WITH
PRICES
FOR
USED
BIKES
IS
THERE
A
BLUE
BOOK
FOR
BIKES
LIKE
THERE
IS
FOR
CARS
THANKS
FOR
ANY
ADVICE
YOU
CAN
GIVE
MARK
MARK
IS
NOT
TOO
MANY
MILES
ON
A
I
SOLD
MY
WELL
MAINTAINED
WITH
MILES
ON
IT
AND
THE
ENGINE
WAS
IN
MINT
CONDITION
ALL
THAT
THE
BIKE
NEEDED
WAS
STEERING
HEAD
BEARINGS
AND
FORK
BUSHINGS
AND
SEALS
THE
GUY
WHO
BOUGHT
IT

A
MECHANIC

THE
VALVE
COVERS
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
TOP
END
DO
A
COMPRESSION
CHECK
ETC
HE

SEEMS
A
LITTLE
STEEP
I
BOUGHT

A
YEAR
AGO
AND
IN
ABSOLUTELY
CHERRY
CONDITION
FOR
THERE
IS
A
BLUEBOOK
ASK
YOUR
BANK

CREDIT
UNION
FOR
THE
GOING
PRICE
IVE
SEEN
A
COUPLE
OF
ADS
FOR
VFRS
IN
THE
DOLLAR
RANGE
THEY
ALL
SAID
LOW
MILES
MINT
CONDITION
BUT
I
DIDNT
ACTUALLY
GO
LOOK
AT
THEM
A
VFR
IS
A
VERY
SWEET
BIKE

WILL
LAST
YOU
FOREVER

A
SOFT
FRONT

IS
ANY
INDICATION
AT
MILES
THE
FORK
SPRINGS
WERE
TOTALLY
SHOT
PROGRESSIVE
SPRINGS
FIXED
IT
RIGHT
UP
