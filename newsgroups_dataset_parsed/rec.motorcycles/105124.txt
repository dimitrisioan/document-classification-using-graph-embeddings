HELP
CAR
ACCESSORY
SHOPS
HERE
SELL
STUFF
CALLED
TCUT
WHICH
IS
A
VERY
FINE
CUTTING
PASTE
FOR
PAINT
AND
THIS
WILL
REMOVE
THE
DULL
FINISH
AND
MINOR
ACRATCHES
IT
WILL
ALSO
REMOVE
ALL
THE
TRAFFIC
FILM
AND
STUFF
THAT
YOU
PROBABLY
DONT
REALISE
IS
THERE
AND
GIVE
YOUR
PAINTWORK
ITS
ORIGINAL
LUSTRE
AND
SHINE
IT
CAN
SOMETIMES
REACT
BADLY
WITH
METALLIC
PAINT
THOUGH
SO
TRY
IT
OUT
CAREFULLY
BEFORE
GOING
TO
TOWN
WITH
THE
STUFF
AFTERWARDS
APPLY
WAX
POLISH
AND
ALL
WILL
BE
WELL
AGAIN
BTW
DONT
CONFUSE
TCUT
WITH
THE
CUTTING
PASTE
USED
FOR
GRINDING
IN
VALVESTHE
PRINCIPLES
THE
SAME
BUT
THE
COARSENESS
IS
VASTLY
DIFFERENT
