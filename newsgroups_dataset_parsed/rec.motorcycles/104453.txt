RE
SHIPPING
A
BIKE
CAN
SOMEONE
RECOMMEND
HOW
TO
SHIP
A
MOTORCYCLE
FROM
SAN
FRANCISCO
TO
SEATTLE
AND
HOW
MUCH
MIGHT
IT
COST
I
SHIPPED
MY
FROM
PORTLAND
OREGON
TO
DAYTONA
FOR
THIS
YEARS
BIKE
WEEK
I
RODE
IT
BACK
THE
COMPANY
I
USED
IS
THE
FEDERAL
COS
YOU
CAN
REACH
THEM
AT
EX
YOU
EITHER
HAVE
TO
BE
A
AMA
MEMBER
OR
MAYBE
IT
IS
JUST
A
DISCOUNT
FOR
AMA
NOT
SURE
CALL
TO
BECOME
AN
AMA
MEMBER
THE
SHIPPING
COST
IS
BASED
ON
THE
NUMBER
OF
MILES
IT
COST
ME
ABOUT
FOR
PORTLAND
TO
ORLANDO
OF
THAT
WAS
INSURANCE
ALL
I
HAD
TO
DO
IS
RIDE
IT
TO
THE
SHIPPING
DOCK
AND
SIPHON
THE
GAS
OUT
I
THINK
THEY
CAN
ALSO
PICK
UP
THE
BIKE
FROM
ANY
BUSINESS
THE
BIKE
ARRIVED
ONTIME
AT
ORLANDO
ALL
I
HAD
TO
DO
WAS
ADJUST
THE
MIRRORS
AND
ADD
GAS
THE
BIKE
WAS
IN
PERFECT
SHAPE
GARY
