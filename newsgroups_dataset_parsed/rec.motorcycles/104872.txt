WRITES
AND
COPPED
HEH
AN
ATTITUDE
WHEN
HE
WAS
STOPPED
SPEAKING
AS
A
GUY
WHO
RECIEVED
A
VERBAL
WARNING
FOR
IN
A
I
JUST
HAVE
TO
LAUGH
IN
SHREVEPORT
BACK
WHEN
I
WAS
RIDING
THE
PURPLE
WATER
BUFFALO
I
JUMPED
AN
INTERSECTION
IN
FRONT
OF
A
COP
WHO
WAS
WAITING
FOR
THE
LIGHT
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
STREET
HE
WAS
ON
WAS
HIDDEN
BUY
A
BUILDING
ON
THE
CORNER
AND
I
DIDNT
SEE
HIM
TILL
I
WAS
AIRBORNE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
INTERSECTION
I
WAS
PARKED
HAD
MY
HELMENT
OFF
AND
MY
LISCENCE
OUT
BEFORE
HE
TURNED
THE
CORNER
HE
CHEWED
MY
ASS
OUT
AND
LET
ME
GO
I
WILL
BE
THE
FIRST
TO
ADMIT
IT
WAS
A
VERY
SQUIDLY
THING
TO
DO
JUMPING
THE
INTERSECTION
LIKE
THAT
THE
COP
SHOULD
HAVE
NAILED
ME
I
FIND
THAT
IF
YOU
ARE
POLITE
RESPECTFULL
AND
HONEST
THEY
WILL
NORMALY
LET
YOU
GET
AWAY
WITH
A
LOT
OF
STUFF
