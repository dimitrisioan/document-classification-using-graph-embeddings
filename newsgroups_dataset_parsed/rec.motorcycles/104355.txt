more
moa
stuff
like
the
ra
ok
so
weve
got
a
hotly
contested
bmwoa
election
and
some
inept
leadership
my
question
is
the
history
of
the
bmw
organization
that
lead
to
the
formation
of
the
bmwra
was
there
something
going
on
in
the
oa
years
ago
that
precipitated
the
formation
of
two
competing
owners
groups
just
to
stave
off
flames
im
a
relatively
new
member
of
both
groups
and
besides
a
difference
in
the
slickness
of
the
magazines
it
seems
the
major
difference
is
that
the
ra
guys
seem
to
have
more
fun

dod
real
bmws
have
just
two
wheels
in
my
opinion
theres
nothing
in
this
world
beats
a
vincent
and
a
redheaded
girl
