SPLITFIRE
PLUGS
KINDA
OFFICAL
YO
WHAZ
UP
EARLIER
I
WAS
READING
ON
THE
NET
ABOUT
USING
SPLITFIRE
PLUGS
ONE
GUY
WAS
THINKING
ABOUT
IT
AND
ALMOST
EVERYBODY
SHOT
HIM
TO
HELL
WELL
I
SAW
ONE
THINK
THAT
SOMEONE
SAID
ABOUT
SHOW
ME
A
TEAM
THAT
USED
SPLIT
FIRES
WELL
HERES
SOME
ADDITIONAL
INSIGHT
AND
SOME
THEORIES
ABOUT
SPLITFIRE
PLUGS
AND
HOW
THEY
BOOST
US
AS
OPPOSSED
TO
CAGES
SPLITFIRES
WERE
ORIGINALLY
MADE
TO
BURN
FUEL
MORE
EFFICIENTLY
AND
INCREASED
POWER
FOR
THE
CAGES
WELL
FOR
THESE
GUYS
SPLITFIRES
INCREASED
PERFORMANCE
BY
INCREASING
TORQUE
THEY
WERENT
FOCUSING
ON
HORSEPOWER
NUMBERS
NOW
HOW
DOES
THIS
RELATED
TO
US
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
PILOTS
WELL
THAT
DEPENDS
DO
YOU
PILOT
A
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
OR
MACHINE
IN
THE
CASE
OF
SPLITFIRES
WOULD
INCREASE
OVERALL
TORQUE
BUT
MAKE
MORE
TOP
END
HORSEPOWER
WITH
ITS
TORQUE
PACKED
DOWN
LOW
SO
FOR
SPLITFIRES
WOULD
NOT
SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASE
POWER
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
TWINS
MANY
OF
YOU
GUYS
LAUGH
AT
SOME
OF
US
TWINS
BUT
MANY
TIMES
WE
CARRY
LESS
WEIGHT
WHICH
SOMETIMES
CAN
MAKE
UP
FOR
THE
HP
LOSS
SEE
DOUG
POLEN
VS
SCOTT
RUSSELL
DAYTONA
HOWEVER
TWINS
MAKE
MORE
TORQUE
THOUGHOUT
THEIR
POWERBANDS
SO
HOW
DOES
THIS
TRANSLATE
INCREASED
TORQUE
SHOULD
THEORETICALLY
HELP
TWINS
MAKE
MORE
POWER
SPLITFIRE
CLAIMS
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
NOT
EXTRA
MODS
OR
ANYTHING
MADE
JUST
STICK
EM
IN
NOW
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
ALL
OF
THIS
AND
IM
TRYING
TO
CATCH
UP
WITH
SOMEBODY
ABOUT
IT
NOW
BUT
SPLITFIRES
SHOULD
HELP
TWINS
MORE
THAN
AS
FAR
AS
RACING
TEAMS

FERRACI
