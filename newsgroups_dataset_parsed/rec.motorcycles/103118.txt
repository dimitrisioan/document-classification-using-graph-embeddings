the

wave
to
other
bikers
is
one
of
our
favorite
flame
wars
i
am
happy
to
say
that
some
harley
riders
in
our
area
are
better
than
most
that
are
flamed
about
here
i
riding
a
lowly
sport
bike
no
less
and
my
girlfriend
were
the
recipient
of
no
less
than
twenty
waves
from
a
group
of
at
least
twentyfive
harley
riders
i
was
leading
a
group
of
about
four
sport
bikes
at
the
time
i
initiated
some
of
the
waves
but
not
all
it
was
a
perfect
day
and
friendly
riders
despite
some
brand
differences
made
it
all
the
better
