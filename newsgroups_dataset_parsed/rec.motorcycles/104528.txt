ROLLSROYCE
OWNED
BY
A
NONBRITISH
FIRM
YE
GODS
THAT
WOULD
BE
THE
END
OF
CIVILIZATION
AS
WE
KNOW
IT
WHY
NOT
FORD
OWNS
ASTONMARTIN
AND
JAGUAR
GENERAL
MOTORS
OWNS
LOTUS
AND
VAUXHALL
ROVER
IS
ONLY
OWNED
BY
HONDA
YES
ITS
A
MINOR
BLASPHEMY
THAT
US
COMPANIES
WOULD
ON
THE
LIKES
OF
AM
JAGUAR
OR
SOB
LOTUS
ITS
OUTRIGHT
SACRILEGE
FOR

HAVE
NONBRITISH
OWNERSHIP
ITS

BE
A
BRITISH
COMPANYOWNER
IE

CAN
SELL
THE
COMPANY
BUT
NOT
THE
