as
we
know
it
why
not
ford

jaguar
general
motors
owns
lotus
and
vauxhall
rover
is
only
owned
by
honda
yes
its
a
minor
blasphemy
that
us
companies
would
on
the

of
am
jaguar
or
sob
lotus
its
outright
sacrilege
for
rr
to
have
nonbritish
ownership
its
a
fundamental
thing
i
think
there
is
a
legal
clause
in
the
rr
name
regardless
of
who
owns
it
it
must
be
a
british
companyowner
ie
ba
can
sell
the
company
but
not
the
name
