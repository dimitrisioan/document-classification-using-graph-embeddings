ADVICE
IS
WORTH
WHAT
YOU
PAID
I
CANT
THINK
OF
ANOTHER
SUBJECT
THAT
GENERATES
AS
MUCH
CONTRADICTORY
ADVICE
AS
TRAFFIC
LAWS
AND
THEIR
ENFORCEMENT
EVERYBODYS
GOT
AN
OPINION
AND
IS
DEAD
CERTAIN
THEY
ARE
RIGHT
YET
ACURATE
INFORMATION
IS
EXTREMELY
DIFFICULT
TO
COME
BY
THE
DMV
DOESNT
KNOW
COPS
DONT
KNOW
YOUR
TRAFFIC
SCHOOL
INSTRUCTOR
DOESNT
KNOW
THE
VEHICLE
CODE
ONLY
TELLS
PART
OF
THE
STORY
JUDGES
CHOOSE
TO
INTERPRET
THE
LAWS
IN
A
WIDE
VARIETY
OF
WAYS
AND
THE
PUBLIC
AT
LARGE
I
SELDOM
HEAR
ANY
ADVICE
THAT
DOESNT
DISAGREE
WITH
SOMETHING
IVE
EXPERIENCED
IF
YOU
DONT
BELIEVE
ME
I
SUGGEST
YOU
GET
A
COPY
OF
THE
VEHICLE
CODE
STUDY
IT
AND
THEN
SIT
IN
ON
A
DAY
OR
TWO
OF
COURT
AND
SEE
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENS
READ
FIGHT
YOUR
TICKET
TOO
BUT
DONT
MISS
THE
LITTLE
SECTION
AT
THE
END
WHERE
IT
SAYS
YOUR
CHANCES
ARE
LOUSY
AND
YOURE
BASICALLY
SCREWED
AS
YOU
MAY
HAVE
GUESSED
IM
PRETTY
DOWN
ON
THE
SYSTEM
HERE
IN
CALIFORNIA
IVE
CAREFULLY
PREPARED
FOR
COURT
BRINGING
WITNESSES
AND
REVEALING
SERIOUS
HOLES
IN
THE
OFFICERS
STORY
ONLY
TO
BE
SLAPPED
WITH
THE
MAXIMUM
ALLOWABLE
FINE
PLUS
ASSESSMENTS
OF
OVER
THE
MESSAGE
CLEAR
THAT
THE
JUDGE
DOES
NOT
APPRECIATE
JOHN
Q
PUBLIC
TRYING
HIS
OWN
CASES
SO
HERES
MY
ADVICE
WHEN
YOU
FIND
YOURSELF
WITH
A
TICKET
TAKE
TRAFFIC
SCHOOL
IF
YOU
CAN
IF
ITS
A
SERIOUS
MATTER
GET
A
LAWYER
A
LAWYER
CAN
PRESENT
THE
EXACT
SAME
CASE
AS
YOU
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
THE
SENTENCE
