BATTERY
STORAGE
WHY
NOT
CHARGE
AND
STORE
DRY
SO
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
IM
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
PUT
A
COUPLE
OF
BIKES
IN
STORAGE
FOR
A
FEW
MONTHS
STARTING
SEVERAL
MONTHS
FROM
NOW
AND
IM
ALREADY
CONTEMPLATING
HOW
TO
DO
IT
SO
THEYRE
AS
EASY
TO
GET
GOING
AGAIN
AS
POSSIBLE
I
HAVE
EVERYTHING
UNDER
CONTROL
I
THINK
BESIDES
THE
BATTERIES
I
KNOW
THAT
IF
I
BUY
A
BATTERY
TENDER
FOR
EACH
ONE
AND
LEAVE
THEM
PLUGGED
IN
THE
WHOLE
TIME
THE
BIKES
ARE
IN
STORAGE
THEYLL
BE
FINE
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
THATS
NECESSARY
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
ANYONE
DISCUSSING
THIS
IDEA
SO
MAYBE
THERES
SOME
REASON
WHY
IT
ISNT
SO
GREAT
BUT
MAYBE
SOMEONE
CAN
TELL
ME
WOULD
IT
BE
A
MISTAKE
TO
FULLY
CHARGE
THE
BATTERIES
DRAIN
THE
ELECTROLYTE
INTO
SEPARATE
CONTAINERS
ONE
FOR
EACH
BATTERY
SEAL
THE
CONTAINER
CLOSE
UP
THE
BATTERIES
AND
LEAVE
THEM
THAT
WAY
THEN
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
WHEN
THE
BIKES
COME
OUT
OF
STORAGE
I
COULD
PUT
THE
ELECTROLYTE
BACK
IN
THE
BATTERIES
AND
THEY
SHOULD
STILL
BE
FULLY
CHARGED
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
THIS
ON
A
RELATED
BUT
DIFFERENT
NOTE
FOR
YOU
BAY
AREA
DENIZENS
WASNT
THERE
SOMEONE
WHO
HAD
A
BUNCH
OF
SPARE
EDTA
A
FEW
MONTHS
BACK
WHO
WAS
IT
IS
THERE
STILL
ANY
OF
IT
LEFT
THANKS
FOR
ANY
AND
ALL
HELP
ROBERT
