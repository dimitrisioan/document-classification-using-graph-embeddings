FOOTPEG
ENGINEERING
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
OKAY
DODERS
HERES
A
GODDAMN
MYSTERY
FOR
YA
THE
STUD
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BIKE
THAT
CLUNKED
WHEN
I
TURNED
WAS
ABSENT
IM
FAIRLY
SURE
IT
WAS
THERE
BEFORE
THE
EVENT
IN
FACT
THE
THREAD
IN
THE
HOLE
IN
THE
FOOTPEG
WAS
PERFECTLY
INTACT
WITH
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
SOMETHING
HAVING
BEEN
FORCEFULLY
RIPPED
OUT
OF
IT
ONLY
MOMENTS
PREVIOUSLY
OKAY
ALL
YOU
ENGINEERING
TYPES
HOW
THE
FK
DO
YOU
EXPLAIN
THIS
HOW
CAN
YOU
RIP
A
TIGHTLY
FITTING
STEEL
THREAD
OUT
OF
A
THREADED
HOLE
IN
ALLOY
WITHOUT
DAMAGING
THE
THREAD
IN
THE
HOLE
YOU
CANT
KNOCK
A
THREADED
STUD
OUT
FROM
ITS
HOLE
WITHOUT
DESTROYING
THE
THREADS
ALSO
PART
OF
THE
STUD
WOULD
STILL
BE
IN
THE
HOLE
THEREFORE
THE
STUD
WAS
NOT
IN
THE
HOLE
BEFORE
YOU
TOUCHED
SOMETHING
DOWN
ON
THAT
SIDE
OF
THE
BIKE
DR
DOOM
