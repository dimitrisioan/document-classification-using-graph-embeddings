whats
the
feeling
about
eating
and
riding
i
went
out
riding
this
weekend
and
got
a
little
carried
away
with
some
pecan
pie
the
whole
ride
back
i
felt
sluggish
i
was
certainly
much
more
alert
on
the
ride
in
im
sure
others
have
the
same
feeling
but
the
strangest
thing
is
that
eating
is
usually
the
turnaround
point
of
weekend
rides
from
now
on
a
little
snack
will
do
id
much
rather
have
a
get
that
fullsluggish
feeling
closer
to
home

dod
to
maintain
my
senses
at
their
sharpest
i
never
eat
a
full
meal
within
hrs
of
a
ride
ive
tried
slim
fast
lite
before
a
ride
but
found
that
my
lap
times
around
the
parliament
buildings
suffered
secs
the
resultant
pound
weight
loss
over
the
summer
just
sharpens
my
bikes
handling
and
i
can
always
look
forward
to
a
winter
of
carboloading
