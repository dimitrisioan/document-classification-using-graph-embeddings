BACK
BREAKER
NEAR
HIT
ABOUT
A
YEAR
AND
HALF
AGO
WHEN
I
FIRST
STARTED
RIDING
I
TOOK
A
MSF
COURSE
I
HAVE
TAKEN
THOSE
LESSONS
TO
HEART
OVER
THE
PAST
YEAR
I
HAVE
HAD
ONLY
A
FEW
NEAR
COLLISIONS
WITH
TRAFFIC
MORONS
ON
FOUR
WHEELS
YESTERDAY
I
GOT
TO
ADD
ANOTHER
TO
THE
LIST
BUT
WITH
THIS
ONE
I
FELT
THE
MOST
HELPLESS
I
AM
SITTING
AT
A
LIGHT
ABOUT
CAR
LENGTHS
BEHIND
A
CAR
A
WISE
DECSION
SUDDENLY
I
HEAR
SCREECHING
TIRES
I
DART
MY
EYES
TO
MY
MIRRORS
AND
REALIZE
ITS
THE
MOROON
FLYING
UP
RIGHT
BEHIND
ME
IN
MY
PANIC
I
POP
MY
CLUTCH
AND
STALL
THE
BIKE
LUCKILY
THE
GUY
STOPS
A
FOOT
BEHIND
MY
REAR
WHEEL
I
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
THEORETICALLY
STOP
SO
FAR
BEHIND
A
CAR
BUT
CAN
YOU
REALLY
IN
ACTUALITY
AVOID
SUCH
AN
INCIDENT
