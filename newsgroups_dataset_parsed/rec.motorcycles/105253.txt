another
good
place
for
your
helmet
is
your
mirror
i
kid
you
not
if
you
own
a
typical
standard
or
other
bike
with
fairly
average
mirrors
that
screw
into
your
handlebars
your
helmet
should
fit
over
your
mirror
and
be
fairly
stable
butt
butt
then
yu
be
able
ee
the
car
neakg
up
behind
yu
and
a
whhheeeeelllleeeee
dtchum
and
the
chick
dig
it
seriously
though
putting
a
helmet
on
a
mirror
is
inadvisable
because
you
are
then
resting
the
weight
of
the
helmet
on
the
fragile
foam
liner
that
is
expected
to
cushion
your
noggin
and
once
crushed
that
foam
never
pops
back
a
variation
of
mirror
hanging
thing
is
what
i
do
with
the
bike
on
the
sidestand
hey
the
centerstand
is
for
maintenance
i
turn
the
wheel
to
the
stop
left
and
can
hang
the
helmet
by
the
chinbar
on
the
right
grip
there
is
no
crushable
foam
in
the
chinbar
and
it
is
pretty
secure
on
there
as
long
as
the
forks
are
locked
if
i
have
to
leave
the
helmet
with
the
parked
bike
and
the
bags
arent
onfull
that
is
about
the
most
stable
place
