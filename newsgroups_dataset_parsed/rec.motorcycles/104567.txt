well
it
looks
like
im
fcked
for
insurance
i
had
a
dwi
in
and
for
the
beemer
as
a
rec
vehicle
itll
cost
me
almost
bucks
to
insureyear
now
what
do
i
do
sell
the
bike
and
the
car
and
start
taking
the
bus
that
way
you
can
keep
drinking
which
seems
to
be
where
your
priorities
lay
i
expect
that
enough
of
us
on
this
list
have
lost
friends
because
of
driving
drunks
that
our
collective
sympathy
will
be
somewhat
muted
look
guy
i
doubt
anyone
here
approves
of
drunk
driving
but
if
hes
been
caught
and
convicted
and
punished
maybe
you
ought
to
lighten
up
i
mean
it
isnt
like
most
of
us
havent
had
a
few
and
then
ridden
or
driven
home
we
just
didnt
get
caught
and
i
can
speak
for
myself
and
say
it
will
never
happen
again
but
that
is
beside
the
point
in
answer
to
the
original
poster
id
insure
whatever
vehicle
is
cheapest
and
can
get
you
to
and
from
work
and
suffer
through
it
for
a
few
years
til
your
rates
drop
and
dont
drink
and
drive
i
had
one
friend
killed
by
a
drunk
and
i
was
rear
ended
by
one
totaling
my
bike
bent
frame
and
only
failing
to
kill
me
because
i
had
an
eye
on
my
mirror
while
i
waited
at
the
stoplight
regards
charles
within
the
span
of
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
heard
elements
of
separate
threads
which
in
that
they
have
been
conjoined
in
time
struck
together
to
form
a
new
chord
within
my
hollow
and
echoing
gourd
