THE
BEST
OF
TIMES
THE
WORST
OF
TIMES
NOTE
THIS
IS
NOT
ABOUT
THE
LA
OR
NY
TIMES
A
FEW
TIMES
A
YEAR
A
FUNNY
THING
HAPPENS
THE
BIKE
ENGINE
RUNS
PERFECTLY
COMPLETELY
SMOOTH
NOT
THAT
IT
RUNS
POORLY
NORMALLY
BUT
ON
THESE
DAYS
IT
IS
EXCEPTIONAL
MY
THEORY
IS
THAT
THE
AIR
DENSITY
AND
MOISTURE
CONTENT
OF
THE
AIR
ARE
SUCH
THAT
I
GET
COMPLETE
COMBUSTION
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
IT
PUTS
ME
IN
A
GREAT
MOOD
THE
MOOD
LASTED
FOR
ABOUT
MILES
HEADING
NORTH
ON
THE
FREEWAY
ABOUT
A
MILE
OR
TWO
SOUTH
OF
THE
MY
THROTTLE
STOPPED
RESPONDING
AND
I
WAS
BETWEEN
LANES
NOTHING
TO
DO
BUT
MAKE
MY
WAY
OVER
LANES
TO
THE
SHOULDER
INITIALLY
BY
GLIDING
THEN
BY
PUSHING
AT
LEAST
TRAFFIC
WAS
HEAVY
ENOUGH
SO
THAT
CARS
DID
NOT
MIND
STOPPING
FOR
ME
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
A
SCREW
UNSCREWED
INSIDE
MY
MIKUNI
CARB
I
KEEP
HEARING
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
KEEP
ALL
OF
THE
SCREWS
TIGHT
ON
A
BIKE
BUT
I
NEVER
THOUGHT
THAT
I
HAD
TO
DO
THAT
ON
THE
SCREWS
INSIDE
OF
A
CARB
AT
LEAST
IT
WAS
ROADSIDE
FIXABLE
AND
I
WAS
ON
MY
WAY
IN
HARDLY
ANY
TIME
DEATH
IS
LIFES
WAY
OF
TELLING
YOU
YOUVE
BEEN
FIRED
