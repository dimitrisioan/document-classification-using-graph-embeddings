i
am
looking
for
a
new
tank
bag
now
and
i
wondered
if
you
as
follow
owners
could
make
some
suggestions
as
to
what
has
and
has
not
worked
for
you
if
there
is
already
a
file
on
this
i
apologize
for
asking
and
will
gladly
accept
any
flames
that
are
blown
my
way
with
the
fjs
large
flat
gas
tank
id
imagine
that
almost
anything
would
work
personally
im
quite
happy
with
my
eclipse
standard
tank
bag
i
think
the
only
thing
to
watch
for
is
the
number
of
attachment
straps
most
come
with
and
some
with
i
have
a
bagman
strap
tankbag
and
because
the
rear
of
the
tank
is
so
narrow
the
fit
is
not
optimal
