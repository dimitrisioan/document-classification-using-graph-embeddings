read
this
i
first
heard
it
about
academic
politics
but
the
same
thought
seems
to
apply
to
the
bmwmoa
the
politics
is
so
dirty
because
the
stakes
are
so
small
who
cares
i
get
my
duesworth
from
the
ads
and
occasional
technical
articles
in
the
news
i
skip
the
generally
drab
articles
about
someones
trek
across
iowa
if
some
folks
get
thrilled
by
the
power
of
the
bmwmoa
they
deserve
whatever
thrills
their
sad
lives
provide
btw
i
voted
for
new
blood
just
to
keep
things
stirred
