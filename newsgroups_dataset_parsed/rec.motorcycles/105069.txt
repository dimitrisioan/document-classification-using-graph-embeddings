SO
HOW
DO
I
STEER
WHEN
MY
HANDS
ARENT
ON
THE
BARS
OPEN
BUDWEISER
IN
LEFT
HAND
CAMEL
CIGARETTE
IN
THE
RIGHT
NO
FEET
ALLOWED
IF
I
LEAN
AND
THE
BIKE
TURNS
AM
I
COUNTERSTEERING
NO
THE
BARS
WOULD
TURN
ONLY
TOWARD
THE
DIRECTION
OF
TURN
IN
NOHANDS
STEERING
JUST
IN
CASE
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
WAS
LOOKING
FOR
A
SERIOUS
ANSWER
ILL
SUPPLY
ONE
YES
EVEN
WHEN
STEERING
NO
HANDS
YOU
DO
SOMETHING
QUITE
SIMILAR
TO
COUNTERSTEERING
BASICALLY
TO
TURN
LEFT
YOU
TO
A
QUICK
WIGGLE
OF
THE
BIKE
TO

RIGHT
FIRST
CAUSING
A
COUNTERACTING
LEAN
TO
OCCUR
TO
THE
LEFT
IT
IS
A
LOT
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
DO
ON
A
MOTORCYCLE
THAN
A
BICYCLE
THOUGH
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EXTRA
WEIGHT
OK
SO
MY
MOTORCYCLE
IS
HEAVY
MAYBE
YOUS
ISNT
