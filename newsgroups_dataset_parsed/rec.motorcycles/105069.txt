so
how
do
i
steer
when
my
hands
arent
on
the
bars
open
budweiser
in
left
hand
camel
cigarette
in
the
right
no
feet
allowed
if
i
lean
and
the
bike
turns
am
i
countersteering
no
the
bars
would
turn
only
toward
the
direction
of
turn
in
nohands
steering
just
in
case
the
original
poster
was
looking
for
a
serious
answer
ill
supply
one
yes
even
when
steering
no
hands
you
do
something
quite
similar
to
countersteering
basically
to
turn
left
you
to
a
quick
wiggle
of
the
bike
to
the
right
first
causing
a
counteracting
lean
to
occur
to
the
left
it
is
a
lot
more
difficult
to
do
on
a
motorcycle
than
a
bicycle
though
because
of
the
extra
weight
ok
so
my
motorcycle
is
heavy
maybe
yous
isnt
