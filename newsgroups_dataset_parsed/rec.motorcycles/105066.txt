SOME
POTENTIALLY
COOL
STORY
STUFF
HERE
DO
SHARE
THE
DETAILS
HOW
TO
GET
A
VERBAL
WARNING
FOR
IN
A
ITS
SIMPLE
FIRST
IT
HAS
TO
BE
THE
FIRST
REALLY
NICE
RIDING
DAY
OF
SPRING
THE
BIKE
IS
BACK
TOGETHER
AGAIN
AND
SO
ARE
YOU
GRAB
ALL
YOUR
GEAR
PUT
IT
ON
AND
FILL
THE
TANK
WITH
OCTANE
PREMIUM
OR
BETTER
HEAD
OUT
IN
AMES
THERE
IS
A
ROAD
THAT
LEADS
TO
THE
LITTLE
TOWN
OF
GILBERT
GILBERT
HAS
ONE
STOP
LIGHT
IF
THAT
TELLS
YOU
SOMETHING
HAVING
JUST
GOTTEN
THE
BIKE
BACK
TOGETHER
I
THOUGHT
ID
TAKE
IT
FOR
A
SHORT
RIDE
AND
CHECK
THINGS
OUT
HEADING
OUT
OF
TOWN
I
WENT
INTO
THE
TWISTIES
AT
A
SLOW
PACE
JUST
UNDER
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
AND
STARTED
LEANING
AROUND
THE
PACE
QUICKENED
AS
EVERYTHING
FELT
JUST
RIGHT
FINALLY
THE
ROAD
STRAIGHTENED
AND
I
WAS
READY
FOR
A
BIT
OF
SPEED
GRAB
THIRD
GEAR
OPEN
HER
UP
AT
ROUGHLY
GRAB
FOURTH
GEAR
LOOK
AT
AS
MUCH
OF
THE
BIKE
AS
YOU
CAN
AND
FAIL
TO
NOTICE
A
STATE
TROOPER
FOLLOWING
A
QUARTER
MILE
BEHIND
TWIST
THE
THROTTLE
LIKE
A
FOOL
GRAB
FIFTH
GEAR
AT
OR
SO
AND
SEE
JUST
HOW
WELL
SHES
BEEN
PUT
BACK
TOGETHER
AT
ACCORDING
TO
RADAR
I
NOTICED
THE
FRONT
FENDER
WAS
FLEXING
A
BIT
THUS
I
SLOWED
PULLED
OFF
THE
ROAD
REMOVED
MY
HELMET
AND
GLOVES
UNSLUNG
THE
TOOK
KIT
I
WAS
CARRYING
IN
A
FANNY
PACK
AND
WAS
JUST
STARTING
TO
TIGHTEN
THAT
FENDER
WHEN
THE
TROOPER
PULLED
IN
ALL
HOT
AND
FLUSTERED
HAVE
YOU
ANY
IDEA
HOW
FAST
YOU
WERE
GOING
NOT
PRECISELY
NO
I
WAS
PAYING
ATTENTION
TO
THE
BIKE
AND
ROAD
NOT
THE
INSTRUMENTS
I
JUST
GOT
HER
BACK
TOGETHER
LAST
NIGHT
AND
IM
JUST
OUT
HERE
TESTING
HER
OUT
BEFORE
I
RIDE
IT
IN
TRAFFIC
MY
RADAR
SAYS
YOU
WERE
AT
OVER
CARE
TO
TELL
ME
WHY
I
SHOULDNT
GIVE
YOU
A
TICKET
BECAUSE
I
WAS
TESTING
THE
MOTORCYCLE
AWAY
FROM
POPULATION
AND
TRAFFIC
ON
A
STRAIT
AND
FLAT
ROAD
WHILE
WEARING
ALL
THE
PROTECTIVE
GEAR
THAT
SAFETY
DEMANDS
NOTE
I
WASNT
QUITE
THAT
ELOQUENT
SAY
WHAT
KIND
OF
BIKE
IS
THAT
ANYWAY
I
WAS
ELOQUENT
ON
MY
CAFE
RACER
REPLICA
HONDA
A
RAT
BIKE
YEAH
I
HAVENT
HAD
MY
BIKE
OUT
OF
THE
GARAGE
IN
YEARS
COMPARE
RIDING
STORIES
PACK
TOOLKIT
HAVING
TIGHTENED
THAT
FENDER
SO
WHY
WERE
YOU
OUT
HERE
I
FIGURE
EVERY
OTHER
IDIOT
ON
THE
ROAD
IS
GOING
TO
LOOK
RIGHT
THROUGH
ME
IF
THE
BIKE
FAILS
SOMEHOW
IN
A
ZONE
IM
DEAD
IF
IT
HOLDS
UP
OUT
HERE
THEN
I
KNOW
IT
WILL
WORK
RIGHT
IN
TRAFFIC
I
DO
THIS
EVVERY
YEAR
WHEN
I
REBUILD
HER
NOT
ANY
MORE
YOULL
FIND
A
BETTER
PLACE
THAN
MY
HIGHWAY
TO
DO
THOSE
SPEEDS
IF
I
EVER
CATCH
YOU
SPEEDING
ON
MY
HIGHWAY
AGAIN
IM
GOING
TO
NAIL
YOU
FOR
EVERYTHING
I
POSSIBLY
CAN
NOW
GET
OUT
OF
MY
SIGHT

TICKET

OFFICER

KID
KEEP
YOUR
EYES
OPEN

IN
A
NUTSHELL
IS
HOW
TO
GET
A
WARNING

WILL
WORK
FOR
YOU
BUT
IT
WORKED
FOR
ME
