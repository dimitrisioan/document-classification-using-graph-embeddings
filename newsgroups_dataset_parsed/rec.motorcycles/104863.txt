IN
LIGHT
OF
THE
LAST
LETTER
I
POSTED
FROM
JEFF
BRODY
CONCERING
THE
CRAP
THAT
IS
GOING
ON
IN
THE
MOA
WHICH
SOME
FOLKS
TOOK
NOT
AS
DISSEMINATION
OF
INFORMATION
THAT
I
RECEIVED
BUT
AS
MY
OWN
BAD
MOUTHING
I
THOUGHT
THAT
I
WOULD
POST
THIS
ONE
WHICH
CAME
TO
ME
YESTERDAY
THIS
IS
FROM
BOARD
MEMBER
ROBERT

APRIL
RE
CECIL
KINGS
NOMINATING
STATEMENT
DEAR
CHICK
WE
HAVE
A
VERY
SERIOUS
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
ELECTION
FOR
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
MOA
THIS
YEAR
CECIL
KINGS
NOMINATING
STATEMENT
AS
IT
APPEARED
IN
THE
OWNERS
NEWS
IS
WORDS
NEARLY
TWICE
AS
MANY
AS
THAT
IS
PERMITTED
BY
THE
BYLAWS
IN
PERTINENT
PART
THE
RULES
STATE
EACH
CANDIDATES
BIOGRAPHY
AND
POSITION
STATEMENT
SHALL
BE
LIMITED
TO
A
COMBINED
TOTAL
OF
NO
MORE
THAN
WORDS
THE
NOMINATING
COMMITTE
SHALL
CUT
AFAFTER
THE
WORD
ANY
BIOGRAPHY
AND
POSITION
STATEMENT
EXCEEDING
THIS
LENGTH
OBVIOUSLY
THE
NOMINATIONG
COMMITTE
WAS
NOT
UP
TO
THE
TASK
HAD
CECILS
STATEMENT
BEEN
CUT
AS
REQUIRED
IT
WOULD
HAVE
CONCLUDED
APPROXIMATELY
WITH
THE
WORD
UNDERTIDING
SIC
IN
THE
SECOND
PARAGRAPH
AFTER
THE
COMMENCEMENT
OF
HIS
POSITION
STATEMENT
AS
A
RESULT
CECIL
HAS
OBTAINED
WHAT
I
VIEW
AS
A
GROSSLY
UNFAIR
ADVANTAGE
OVER
THE
OTHER
CANDIDATES
FOR
PRESIDENT
THIS
DOES
NOT
JUST
TAINT
THE
ELECTION
FOR
THAT
OFFICE
IT
MAKES
A
MOCKERY
OF
THE
PROCESS
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
YOUR
ADVISING
THE
BOARD
IMMEDIATELY
WHAT
STEPS
YOU
INTEND
TO
TAKE
TO
RECTIFY
THIS
CARICATURE
OF
A
FAIR
ELECTION
PARENTHETICALLY
IN
YOUR
PRIVATE
CORRESPONDENCE
WITH
OTHERS
I
WOULD
BE
MOST
APPRECIATIVE
THAT
WHEN
TOU
CALL
ME
AN
ASSHOLE
YOU
REMIND
THE
LETTERS
RECIPIENT
THAT
THE
REPUBLICATION
OF
SUCH
A
COMMENT
IS
ALMOST
GUARANTEED
TO
HAVE
WOEFUL
CONSEQUENCES
WITH
KIND
REGARDS
I
REMAIN
