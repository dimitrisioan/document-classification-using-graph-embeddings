anyone
who
has
handson
experience
on
riding
the
yamaha
vmax
pls
kindly
comment
on
its
handling
from
cycleworld
magazine
who
usually
never
says
anything
bad
about
any
motorcycle
the
max
certainly
has
motor
but
there
are
some
things
it
is
short
of
it
is
short
of
chassis
it
loves
straight
lines
aimed
in
one
it
is
nicely
stable
but
it
is
not
overfond
of
corners
forced
into
one
it
protests
shaking
its
head
chattering
its
front
tire
grinding
its
footpegs
and
generally
making
known
its
preference
for
straight
pavement
bumps
it
doesnt
like
them
either
its
fork
isnt
too
bad
though
it
is
soft
enough
that
it
can
be
bottomed
under
hard
braking
the
shocks
though
which
work
on
that
shorttravel
shaftdrive
swingarm
are
firm
to
the
point
of
harshness
