help
with
backpack
as
summer
approaches
the
usual
preparations
are
being
made
me
was
thinking
of
going
for
some
overnite
camping
trips
in
the
local
state
forests
for
that
i
was
planning
to
get
a
backpackrucksack
the
next
question
is
how
shall
i
carry
the
thing
on
the
bike
given
the
metal
frame
and
all
i
have
a
big
backrest
approx
high
and
was
hoping
that
i
would
be
able
to
bungee
cord
the
backpack
to
the
backrest
any
one
have
any
experiences
on
such
experimentation
taking
the
idea
further
what
would
happen
if
the
backpack
was
fully
loaded
with
a
full
load
is
the
load
distribution
going
to
be
very
severly
affected
how
will
the
bike
perform
with
such
a
load
clinging
to
the
back
rest
if
i
really
secure
it
with
no
shifting
do
i
still
increase
my
chances
of
surfing
collective
rm
wisdom
requested
ps
i
really
cant
afford
leather
pants
boots
and
jeans
are
all
i
can
make
do
with
what
you
think
of
the
knee
protectors
which
rollerbladers
use
the
one
llbean
and
like
sells
is
that
a
bad
idea
tm
are
there
any
equivalents
dod
i
would
give
my
right
arm
to
be
ambidextrous
