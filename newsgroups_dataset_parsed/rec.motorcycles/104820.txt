WRITES
A
TRAFFIC
CITATION
IS
AN
ACCUSATION
OF
HAVING
COMMITTED
A
CRIME
THATS
WHY
THEY
HAVE
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
MOTIONS
OF
HAVING
A
TRIAL
IF
YOU
WANT
ONE
YOU
ARE
STILL
INNOCENT
UNTIL
PROVEN
GUILTY
COPS
ARE
NOT
THE
ONLY
ONES
WHO
CAN
ACCUSE
PEOPLE
OF
COMMITTING
CRIMES
ANYONE
WHO
WITNESSES
A

CAN
DO

GO
TO

EXPLAIN
THE
SITUATION
GIVE

APPEAR

COPS
AND
INDEED
THE
ADVICE
I
GOT
FROM
A
POLICE
OFFICER
WHEN
I
HAD
MY
CLOSE
CALL
WAS
THAT
WITHOUT
ADDITIONAL
IMPARTIAL
WITNESSES
IT
WOULD
BE
MY
WORD
VS
THE
OTHER
DRIVERS
AND
THAT
IT
WAS
UP
TO
ME
TO
DECIDE
WHETHER
THE
TIME
AND
INCONVENIENCE
TO
ME
WAS
WORTH
THE
TIME
AND
INCONVENIENCE
TO
THE
OTHER
DRIVER
AND
ALSO
WHETHER
ANY
POSITIVE
EFFECT
WOULD
RESULT
BEYOND
MAKING
ME
FEEL
BETTER
MY
WORTH
