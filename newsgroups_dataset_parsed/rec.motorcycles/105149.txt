this
summer
july
my
wife
michelle
and
i
will
be
in
boston
attending
my
brothers
wedding
after
the
wedding
we
are
planning
to
motor
up
to
bar
harbor
maine
to
visit
some
relatives
for
a
few
days
our
summer
would
be
made
if
we
could
find
a
bike
or
bikes
to
borrow
or
rent
to
ride
up
to
bar
harbor
and
back
heres
some
important
details
ive
been
riding
for
years
my
own
bikes
for
the
past
years
michelle
has
been
riding
for
the
past
years
her
own
bikes
ive
only
been
involved
in
one
accident
which
was
caused
by
a
cage
driver
running
a
stop
sign
i
currently
own
a
bmw
michelle
owns
a
yamaha
virago
we
prefer
cruising
over
racing
weve
toured
a
fair
amount
were
both
licensed
and
insured
and
were
nice
people
so
if
anyone
has
a
bike
or
bikes
but
the
second
one
would
have
to
be
a
virago
or
something
else
with
an
equally
low
seat
that
they
would
be
willing
to
loan
us
for
days
in
july
michelle
and
i
would
be
eternally
grateful
in
addition
to
our
friendship
you
would
also
have
the
use
of
our
bikes
should
you
ever
pass
through
minneapolis
in
exchange
we
would
be
happy
to
take
you
and
a
guest
out
for
dinner
and
an
evening
of
wild
bike
stories
or
we
might
even
be
willing
to
cough
up
some
money
for
improvements
to
the
bikes
like
new
tires
or
something
also
any
information
about
bike
rentals
in
the
boston
area
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks
