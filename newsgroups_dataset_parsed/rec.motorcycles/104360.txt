WAVES
EVER
EVEN
TO
EACH
OTHER
FROM
WHAT
I
CAN
TELL
WHEN
WE
TAKE
A

CANT
RECOGNIZE

WAVES
WHEN
YOURE
RIDING
A

YOU
WAVE
BY
LIFTING
TWO

THREE
FINGERS
OF
THE
LEFT
HAND
WITHOUT
FIRST
REMOVING
THAT
HAND
FROM
THE
HANDLEBAR
WHEN
YOURE
RIDING

YOU
LOWER
THE

TO

CALL
THAT
A
WAVE
GENERIC
BIKE
RIDERS
ACTUALLY
SEEM
TO
RAISE
THE
HAND
ENTIRELY
OFF
THE
HANDLEBAR
AND
WAVE
IT
AROUND
SO
ITS
EASY
TO
TELL
WHEN
THEYRE
WAVING
