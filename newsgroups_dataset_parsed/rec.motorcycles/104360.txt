most
people
wave
or
return
my
wave
when
im
on
my
harley
other
harley
riders
seldom
wave
back
to
me
when
im
on
my
duck
squids
dont
wave
or
return
waves
ever
even
to
each
other
from
what
i
can
tell
when
we
take
a
hand
off
the
bars
we
fall
down
the
problem
is
that
squids
and
badassbikers
cant
recognize
each
others
waves
when
youre
riding
a
cruiser
you
wave
by
lifting
two
or
three
fingers
of
the
left
hand
without
first
removing
that
hand
from
the
handlebar
when
youre
riding
a
crotch
rocket
you
lower
the
left
hand
to
about
ankle
level
palm
forward
and
call
that
a
wave
generic
bike
riders
actually
seem
to
raise
the
hand
entirely
off
the
handlebar
and
wave
it
around
so
its
easy
to
tell
when
theyre
waving
