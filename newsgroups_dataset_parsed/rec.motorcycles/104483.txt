pisses

off

wells
on
the
apr
cst
wibbled
once
again
this
morning
i
pulled
up
to
the
designated
motorcycle
parking
area
only
to
find
a
cage
pulled
up
behind
the
bikes
if
people
dont
doublepark
cars
why
do
they
do
it
to
motorcycles
never
mind
that
rhetorical
question
i
know
why
they
do
it
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
can
i
do
about
it
carry
pieces
of
paper
that
say
dont
park
your
car
in
the
motorcycle
area
call
the
cops
wait
until
they
emerge
from
the
building
and
berate
them
until
they
beg
forgiveness
does
anyone
else
have
this
problem
and
what
do
you
do
about
it
evie
i
dont
know
if
you
have
a
local
branch
where
you
are
but
the
preferred
method
over
here
is
to
phone
the
ira
and
tell
them
about
the
car
and
that
it
belongs
to
an
mp
who
is
on
a
northern
ireland
government
committee
an
hour
or
so
later
and
the
car
is
no
longer
a
problem
its
best
not
to
park
too
close
to
it
