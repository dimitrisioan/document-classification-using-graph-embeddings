i
am
in
hte
market
for
a
new
bike
been
without
for
a
few
years
the
two
main
bikes
im
looking
at
seriously
are
the
yamaha
virago
and
the
honda
shadow
vlx
i
am
leaning
towards
the
yamaha
for
its
shaft
drive
the
honda
is
chain
insurance
in
fla
is
more
costly
than
i
thought
so
i
am
staying
in
this
power
range
thanks
in
advance
for
any
opinions
and
or
experiences
a
friend
of
mine
whos
probably
reading
this
right
now
just
bought
a
new
yamaha
virago
after
spending
hours
very
late
one
chilly
evening
watching
him
struggle
with
the
bolts
had
to
remove
the
right
peg
loosen
the
brake
pedal
c
c
ive
pretty
much
decided
never
to
get
this
particular
model
unless
he
or
someone
else
wants
to
change
the
oilfilter
for
me
compared
to
the
change
he
was
used
to
for
his
honda
this
is
just
a
design
flawoversight
in
my
eyes
