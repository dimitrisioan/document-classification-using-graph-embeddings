this
tactic
depends
for
its
effectiveness
on
the
dogs
conformance
to
a
psychological
norm
that
may
not
actually
apply
to
a
particular
dog
ive
tried
it
with
some
success
before
but
it
wont
work
on
a
charlie
manson
dog
or
one
thats
really
really
stupid
a
large
irish
setter
taught
me
this
in
my
yard
apparently
his
territory
one
day
im
sure
he
was
playing
a
game
with
me
the
game
was
probably
kill
the
very
angry
neighbor
before
he
can
dispense
the
terrible
punishment
what
a
dog
weighs
maybe
at
max
you
cant
handle
it
you
have
i
presume
thumbs
grapple
with
it
and
tear
its
head
off
sheesh
even
a
trained
attack
dog
is
no
match
for
a
human
we
have
all
the
advantages
look
if
you
are
worried
about
being
attacked
by
a
dog
just
carry
some
spot
remover
with
you
russian
roulette
is
fun
out
of
times
