THE
DIFFERENCE
OF
OPINION
AND
DIFFERENCE
IN
MOTORCYCLING
BETWEEN
THE
SPORTBIKE
RIDERS
AND
THE
CRUISERBIKE
RIDERS
THAT
DIFFERENCE
IS
ONLY
IN
THE
MINDS
OF
CERTAIN
CLOSEDMINDED
INDIVIDUALS
I
HAVE
HAD
THE
VERY
BEST
MOTORCYCLING
TIMES
WITH
RIDERS
OF
CRUISER
BIKES
HI
DON
EDDIE
YET
I
RIDE
ANYTHING
BUT
CONTINUOUSLY
ON
THIS
FORUM
AND
ON
THE
STREET
YOU
FIND
QUITE
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
OPINIONS
OF
WHAT
MOTORCYCLING
IS
TO
DIFFERENT
INDIVIDUALS
YES
YES
YES
MOTORCYCLING
IS
SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT
TO
EACH
AND
EVERY
ONE
OF
US
THIS
IS
THE
NATURE
OF
PEOPLE
AND
ONE
OF
THE
BEAUTIES
OF
THE
SPORT
CRUISERBIKE
RIDERS
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
VIEW
OF
MOTORCYCLING
THAN
THOSE
OF
SPORT
BIKE
RIDERS
WHAT
THEY
LIKE
AND
DISLIKE
ABOUT
MOTORCYCLING
THIS
IS
NOT
CLOSEDMINDED
AND
WHAT
VIEW
EXACTLY
IS
IT
THAT
EVERY
SINGLE
RIDER
OF
CRUISER
BIKES
HOLDS
A
VEIW
THAT
OF
COURSE
NO
SPORTBIKE
RIDER
COULD
POSSIBLY
HOLD
PLEASE
QUANTIFY
YOUR
GENERALIZATION
FOR
US
CAREFUL
NOW
YOURE
TRYING
TO
PIGEONHOLE
A
WHOLE
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
PLASTIC
BODYWORK
IS
USELESS
THAT
TORQUE
AND
AN
UPRIGHT
RIDING
POSITION
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
SLIGHTLY

VERY
LITTLE

UNLESS

SOLELY
BY

THESE
ARE
THE
CRITERIA

USES
TO
SELECT
THE

OF

TO
IGNORE
THESE
AS
WELL
AS
OTHER
CRITERIA
WOULD
BE
INSENSITIVE
IN
OTHER

NO

CAN
FUFILL
THE
