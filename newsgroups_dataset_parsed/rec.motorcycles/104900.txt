WRITES
ANOTHER
TO
THE
LIST
BUT
WITH
THIS
ONE
I
FELT
THE
MOST
HELPLESS
I
AM
SITTING
AT
A
LIGHT
ABOUT
CAR
LENGTHS
BEHIND
A
CAR
A
WISE
DECSION
SUDDENLY
I
HEAR
SCREECHING
TIRES
I
DART
MY
EYES
TO
MY
MIRRORS
AND
REALIZE
ITS
THE
MOROON
FLYING
UP
RIGHT
BEHIND
ME
IN
MY
PANIC
I
POP
MY
CLUTCH
AND
STALL
THE
BIKE
LUCKILY
THE
GUY
STOPS
A
FOOT
BEHIND
MY
REAR
WHEEL
I
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
THEORETICALLY
STOP
SO
FAR
BEHIND
A
CAR
BUT
CAN
YOU
REALLY
IN
ACTUALITY
AVOID
SUCH
AN
INCIDENT
SUGGESTIONS
IVE
ONLY
EVER
DONE
IT
IN
AN
AUTOMATIC
I
WAS
SITTING
IN
MY
OLDS
IN
THE
WINTER
AT
A
LIGHT
WHEN
I
HEARD
SCREECHING
BEHIND
ME
I
MANAGED
TO
DART
INTO
THE
LEFT
TURN
LANE
BEFORE
THE
SLIDING
JETTA
WOUND
UP
HALF
WHERE
I
WAS
AND
HALF
IN
THE
PARKED
CAR
BESIDE
WHERE
I
WAS
IVE
NEVER
HAD
OCCASION
TO
DO
IT
ON
A
BIKE
BUT
I
IMAGINE
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
EVEN
EASIER
BECAUSE
YOU
COULD
SLIP
BESIDE
THE
CAR
IN
FRONT
GIVING
A
GANDER
AT
THE
MIRRORS
WHILE
AT
A
LIGHT
WILL
GIVE
YOU
TIME
TO
GET
THE
CLUTCH
OUT
SMOOTHLY
WHEN
YOU
NOTICE
TROUBLE
INSTEAD
OF
WAITING
FOR
THE
SCREECHING
