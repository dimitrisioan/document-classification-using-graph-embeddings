I
WAS
POSTING
TO
ALTLOCKSMITHING
ABOUT
THE
BEST
METHODS
FOR
SECURING
A
MOTORCYCLE
I
GOT
SEVERAL
RESPONSES
REFERRING
TO
THE
COBRA
LOCK
DESCRIBED
BELOW
HAS
ANYONE
COME
ACROSS
A
STORE
CARRYING
THIS
LOCK
IN
THE
CHICAGO
AREA
ANY
OTHER
FEEDBACK
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
USED
THIS
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
NEW
YAMAHA
CYCLELOK
IT
IS
FAR
FROM
NEW
ITS
BEEN
AROUND
ALMOST
AS
LONG
AS
DIRT
FROM
THE
PHOTO
IN
MOTORCYCLIST
IT
LOOKS
THE
SAME
HARDENED
STEEL
AS
A
KRYPTONITE
U
LOCK
EXCEPT
IT
FOLDS
IN
FIVE
PLACES
IT
SEEMS
TO
EXTEND
OUT
FAR
ENOUGH
TO
LOCK
THE
REAR
TIRE
TO
THE
TUBE
OF
A
PARKING
SIGN
OR
SIMILAR
ANYONE
HAD
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THEM
HOW
EASY
IS
IT
TO
ATTACK
THE
LOCK
AT
THE
JOINTED
SECTIONS
I
HAD
ONE
FOR
ONE
OF
MY
OLD
BIKES
WORKED
FINE
IM
SURE
BEING
RIGID
AND
NONFLEXIBLE
THAT
THE
CYCLELOK
WOULD
YIELD
INSTANTLY
TO
THE
FREEZE
AND
BREAK
ROUTINE
BUT
THEN
FOR
WHAT
DO
YA
WANT
LATER
