THE
QUESTION
FOR
THE
DAY
IS
RE
PASSENGER
HELMETS
IF
YOU
DONT
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
WHOS
GONNA
RIDE
WITH
YOU
LIKE
SAY
YOU
MEET
THEM
AT
A
CHURCH
MEETING
YEAH
THATS
THE
TICKET
WHAT
ARE
SOME
GUIDELINES
SHOULD
I
JUST
PICK
UP
ANOTHER
SHOEI
IN
MY
SIZE
TO
HAVE
A
BACKUP
HELMET
XL
OR
SHOULD
I
MAYBE
GET
AN
INEXPENSIVE
ONE
OF
A
SMALLER
SIZE
TO
ACCOMODATE
MY
LIKELY
PASSENGER
IF
YOUR
PRIMARY
CONCERN
IS
PROTECTING
THE
PASSENGER
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
A
CRASH
HAVE
HIM
OR
HER
FITTED
FOR
A
HELMET
THAT
IS
THEIR
SIZE
IF
YOUR
PRIMARY
CONCERN
IS
COMPLYING
WITH
STUPID
HELMET
LAWS
CARRY
A
REAL
BIG
SPARE
YOU
CAN
PUT
A
BIG
OR
SMALL
HEAD
IN
A
BIG
HELMET
BUT
NOT
IN
A
SMALL
ONE
WELL
YOU
CAN
ACCOMPLISH
BOTH
GOALS
ACTUALLY
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
DEFINITE
PHYSICAL
TYPE
IN
MIND
WHEN
YOU
GO
TO
THESE
COUGH
CHURCH
MEETINGS
IF
YOUR
TASTES
TEND
TO
SMALLER
MORE
PETITE
COUGH
CHURCHGOERS
IT
IS
MORE
LIKELY
THAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
SMALLER
HEAD
AND
YOU
CAN
SAFELY
GET
A
MEDIUM
OR
SMALL
HELMET
THIS
WORKS
FOR
ME
AND
I
TRADED
MY
SPARE
LARGE
HELMET
WITH
MY
BEST
FRIEND
WHO
AT
TENDS
TO
LOOK
MORE
FOR
WOMEN
THAT
ARE
OVER
AND
CANT
USUALLY
FIT
INTO
THE
MEDIUM
SIZE
HELMET
HE
PREVIOUSLY
HAD
OF
COURSE
IF
YOU
ARENT
PICKY
WHAT
SIZE
COUGH
CHURCHGOERS
YOU
GIVE
HELPFUL
MOTORCYCLE
RIDES
TO
THEN
EDS
ADVICE
WILL
HOPEFULLY
COVER
ANY
EVENTUALITY
AS
FAR
AS
LEGALITY
IS
CONCERNED
AND
A
SPARE
HANDTOWEL
IN
THE
TANKBAG
MAKES
ACCEPTABLE
PADDING
SO
THE
PASSENGER
CAN
SEE
OUT
OF
THE
VIEWPORT
RATHER
THAN
THE
PADDING
ABOVE
THE
VIEWPORT
IN
THE
CASES
OF
EXTREME
