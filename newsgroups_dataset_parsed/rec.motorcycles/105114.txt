well
the
actual
ergonomics
of
the
switch
make
it
appear
to
be
a
position
switch
but
sure
enough
as
deam
expected
when
you
balance
the
toggle
switch
in
the
center
position
both
the
high
and
low
beams
go
on
this
provides
a
very
nice
light
coverage

the
road
hmmmm
i
noticed
sometime
ago
that
i
could
do
the
same
on
my
virago
and
since
i
dont
read
many
schematics
i
didnt
really
think
aobut
it
too
much
yes
it
does
provide
excellent
coverage
but
i
figured
it
would
probably
draw
a
little
too
much
current
i
also
figured
that
it
was
overlapped
just
to
prevent
a
blank
spot
of
no
headlight
are
you
saying
that
these
switches
are
designed
for
the
hilo
combination
