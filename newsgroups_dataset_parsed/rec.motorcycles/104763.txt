you
really
expect
a
cop
to
answer
these
honestly
first
you
gotta
expect
a
cop
to
be
honestthats
another
story
yeah
everybody
knows
cops
always
lieand
the
people
they
deal
with
day
in
and
day
out
always
tell
the
truthno
sir

sir
i
wazznut
drinking
tonight
i
was
just
playing
around
back
there
no
sir
i
wasnt
speeding
i
was
realy
only
going
xxmph
it
was
that
guy
next
to
medidnt
ya
see

come
onstereotyping
cops
is
no
better
than
those
that
stereo
type
us
what
say
we
try
to
show
the
same
open
mind
to
those
around
us
as
we
would
ask
for
ourselvesi
know
its
a
stretchbut
its
worth
a
try
my
reason
for
saying
that
was
cause
i
if
i
were
a
cop
wouldnt
go
out
of
my
way
to
tell
people
how
to
break
the
law
would
you
the
part
about
honesty
was
a
joke
sorta
obviously
people
have
had
bad
experiences
with
cops
lying
obviously
nobodys
perfect
and
nobody
always
tells
the
truth
about
everything
or
are
you
god
andy
infante
you
can
listen
to
what
everybody
says
but
the
fact
remains
bmw
that
youve
got
to
get
out
there
and
do
the
thing
yourself

opinions
dammit
have
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
else
