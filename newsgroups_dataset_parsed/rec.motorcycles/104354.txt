RE
BOOM
DOG
ATTACK
AZWABERACUK
ANDY
WOODWARD
WRITES
BETTER
STILL
REVERSE
THIS
SEQUENCE
THEN
HIT
THE
BUGGER
UNDER
ACCELLERATION
TO
STABILISE
YOURSELF
I
HATE
THINGS
THAT
ATTACK
ME
IF
THE
DOG
THINKS
YOU
HAVE
RUN
AWAY
IT
HAS
ESTABLISHED
DOMINANCE
OVER
THESE
FUNNY
NOISY
SHEEP
THINGS
AND
WILL
ATTACK
EVERY
BIKE
THAT
COMES
ALONG
FOR
THE
FUN
OF
IT
IF
YOU
CAN
HURT
THE
BUGGER
IT
LEARNS
THAT
IT
IS
BELOW
BIKES
IN
THE
PECK
ORDER
AND
YOU
MAY
HAVE
SAVED
THE
LIFE
OF
A
FUTURE
BIKER
WHOSE
EVASIVE
ACTION
TO
AVOID
THE
DOG
MIGHT
OTHERWISE
PUT
HIM
UNDER
A
TRUCK
NEVER
AVOID
A
DOG
FOR
THE
DOGS
SAKE
ONLY
YOURE
OWN
I
HATE
TO
ADMIT
THIS
BUT
THERE
DOES
SEEM
TO
BE
SOME
SORT
OF
TWISTED
LOGIC
TO
THIS
APPROACH
ITS
THE
BIKERS
AGAINST
THE
WORLD
AND
THE
DOGS
ARE
JUST
ANOTHER
WORTHLESS
ADVERSARY
SO
REMEMBER
TO
WEAR
AT
LEAST
CALF
HEIGHT
LEATHER
BOOTS
IN
CASE
THE
DOG
GETS
LUCKY
AND
SINKS
HIS
TEETH
INTO
YOUR
ATTACKING
FOOT
AND
GO
FOR
THE
GUSTO
IF
THAT
DOG
DOESNT
RETREAT
FROM
THE
STREET
WITH
HIS
TAIL
BETWEEN
HIS
LEGS
NEXT
TIME
YOU
SEE
IT
THEN
YOU
REALLY
HAVENT
DONE
YOUR
BIT
FOR
ALL
YOUR
FELLOW
BIKERS
THIS
ALSO
APPLIES
IN
CAGES
SORRY
I
CANT
GO
THIS
FAR
A
DOG
AGAINST
AND
ARMORED
CAGE
JUST
DOESNT
SEEM
LIKE
A
FAIR
FIGHT
IF
THE
DOG
IS
OUT
OF
CONTROL
IT
IS
A
MENACE
TO
ALL
ROAD
USERS
AND
NO
COMPUNCTION
SHOULD
BE
FELT
IF
ENSURING
YOUR
SAFETY
MEANS
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
ITS
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
FORCING
THE
GAME
NOT
YOU
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
A
DOG
EAT
DOG
WORLD
DAVE
