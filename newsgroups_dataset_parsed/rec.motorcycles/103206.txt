while
were
on
the
subject
has
anyone
else
noticed
that
the
deep
well
in
craftsmans
sae
deep
well
set
is
too
small
to
fit
a
bolt
or
nut
when
i
took
the
socket
in
for
an
exchange
every
one
of
the
deep
well
sockets
on
the
rack
had
the
exact
same
problem
looking
into
the
socket
it
appears
that
craftsmans
toolmaker
attempted
to
imitate
flank
drive
on
this
piece
but
did
not
account
for
the
extra
clearance
needed
inside
the
socket
never
had
any
problem
with
mine
are
you
sure
the
nutbolt
you
are
trying
is
really
a
hex
is
just
slightly
larger
and
a
wrench
wont
fit
on
a
gm
nut
my
gmc
pickup
has
several
nuts
on
it
really
annoying
metric
threads
too
seems
that
most
of
the
body
is
metric
most
of
the
engine
is
sae
