YEP
IT
WORKS
LIKE
A
CHARM
I
HAD
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
AFTER
ABOUT
YEARS
OF
CONSTANT
USE
AND
I
WAS
THINKING
OF
SEEING
HOW
MUCH
ECLIPSE
WOULD
WANT
TO
INSTALL
A
NEW
ZIPPER
BUT
SOMEONE
I
THINK
IT
WAS
CHUCK
KARISH
SUGGESTED
I
TRY
THAT
TRICK
IT
TOOK
A
COUPLE
OF
TRIES
TO
GET
THE
RIGHT
AMOUNT
OF
SQUISH
BUT
ITS
BEEN
FINE
FOR
ABOUT
YEARS
SINCE
I
SQUISHED
IT
IT
SHOULD
WORK
FOR
ANY
OF
THE
NYLONCOIL
TYPE
ZIPPERS
OTOH
I
TRIED
THIS
ON
MY
HG
CONCORD
JACKET
THURSDAY
NIGHT
REALLY
I
JUST
MADE
A
TINYADJUSTMENT
TYPE
OF
SQUEEZE
REALLY
IS
WAS
YOUR
HG
ZIPPER
THE
NYLONCOIL
TYPE
OR
THE
KIND
WITH
MOLDED
PLASTIC
TEETH
IVE
ONLY
TRIED
IT
ON
THE
COILED
NYLON
TYPE
AND
IT
DOESNT
TAKE
MUCH
SQUISH
TO
FIX
THE
PROBLEM
I
FOUND
I
WAS
OVERDOING
IT
NO
BROKEN
PARTS
BUT
THE
ZIPPER
WAS
TOO
HARD
TO
PULL
SO
AFTER
SPREADING
THE
ZIPPER
PULL
JAWS
AGAIN
I
TRIED
WITH
VICEGRIPS
NO
NOT
THE
USUAL
GRIP
OF
DEATH
TECHNIQUE
I
ADJUSTED
THE
CLOSED
VICEGRIPS
SO
THEY
WERE
SNUG
ON
THE
ZIPPER
JAWS
THEN
RELEASED
THEM
AND
TIGHTENED
THE
ADJUSTING
SCREW
A
BIT
A
COUPLE
OF
ITERATIONS
AND
I
HAD
JUST
THE
RIGHT
AMOUNT
OF
ZIPPER
SQUISH
TM
RESULT
I
NOW
KNOW
THAT
NOPLACE
IN
SPOKANE
WILL
EVEN
CONSIDER
TRYING
TO
REPAIR
A
BROKEN
ZIPPERCLOSERTHINGY
WHICH
MUST
BE
A
PART
WHICH
NEEDS
A
TOOL
TO
INSTALL
IVE
HAD
TWO
ZIPPER
PULLS
FAIL
ON
MY
AEROSTICH
SUIT
ACTUALLY
ON
THE
ACCESSORY
ELLIPSE
AND
THEY
SENT
ME
A
FEW
REPLACEMENT
PULLS
FREE
OF
CHARGE
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
BRAND
OF
ZIPPERS
HG
USES
BUT
PARTS
ARE
AVAILABLE
FOR
YKKS
PLASTIC
ZIPPERS
REPLACEMENT
WAS
PRETTY
SIMPLE
JUST
BREAK
AND
REMOVE
THE
PLASTIC
KNOB
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
ZIPPER
THAT
KEEPS
THE
PULL
FROM
COMING
OFF
THE
TOP
END
SLIDE
ON
THE
NEW
ZIPPER
PULL
THEN
CRIMP
ON
VICEGRIPS
AGAIN
A
REPLACEMENT
ZIPPER

MIGHT
TRY
FABRIC
STORES
SUCH
AND
SEE
IF
THEY
SELL
