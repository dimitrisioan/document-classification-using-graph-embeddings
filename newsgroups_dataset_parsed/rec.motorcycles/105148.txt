lotus
looks
set
for
a
management
buyout
gm
werent
happy
that
the
elan
was
late
and
too
pricey
if
they
can
write
off
the
elan
development
costs
the
may
be
able
to
sell
them
for
a
sensible
price
i
read
that
gm
wants
to
keep
the
design
part
of
lotus
but
lose
the
car
production
and
i
seem
to
remember
that
the
main
problem
with
the
elan
was
caused
by
gms
insistence
that
the
elan
be
redesigned
significantly
for
the
us
market
which
caused
major
design
production
headaches
i
think
there
is
a
legal
clause
in
the
rr
name
regardless
of
who
owns
it
it
must
be
a
british
companyowner
ie
ba
can
sell
the
company
but
not
the
name
kevinhhaslerascomch
i
dont
believe
that
ba
have
anything
to
do
with
rr
its
a
seperate
company
from
the
rr
aeroengine
company
its
vickers
who
own
rolls
royce
cars
quite
true
brain
fade
on
my
part
