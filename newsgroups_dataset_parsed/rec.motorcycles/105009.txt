RE
NEED
ADVICE
FOR
RIDING
WITH
SOMEONE
ON
PILLION
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
I
ORIGINALLY
LIKED
MY
CURRENT
GUYTHINGY
SO
MUCH
WAS
BECASE
HE
HAD
A
BMW
SIGH
THATS
MUSIC
TO
MY
EARS
AFTER
ALL
THE
COMPLAINING
LOIS
DID
ABOUT
THE
SEAT
ON
MY
BMW
THE
BEST
PASSENGERS
ARE
THOSE
WHICH
ARE
UNOBTRUSIVE
ECHO
THE
MOVEMENTS
AND
LEAN
OF
YOUR
RIDER
LOOK
OVER
THE
SHOULDER
THATS
MOST
COMFORTABLE
BUT
DURING
TURNS
LOOK
OVER
THE
SHOULDER
ON
THE
INSIDE
OF
THE
TURN
IVE
FOUND
THAT
THE
PHRASE
SACK
OF
POTATOES
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
IN
DESCRIBING
TO
A
PASSENGER
HOW
SHE
SHOULD
ACT
SWITCH
YOUR
HANDS
TO
THE
GUARDRAIL
TO
STRETCH
YOUR
SHOULDERS
BUT
BE
SURE
AND
SQUEEZE
YOUR
THIGHS
WHILE
YOURE
DOING
IT
SO
YOUR
RIDER
KNOWS
YOURE
STILL
THERE
THE
GUARD
RAIL
ISNT
AS
SAFE
AS
HOLDING
ONTO
YOUR
RIDER
ON
A
LONG
RIDE
WITH
MY
EXGIRLFRIEND
NANCY
I
WOULD
NOTICE
HER
DRIFTING
OFF
EVERY
SO
OFTEN
WE
WERE
DRONING
DOWN
HIGHWAY
TO
LA
I
PROBABLY
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
AWARE
OF
THIS
IF
SHE
HADNT
BEEN
IN
THE
HABIT
OF
SQUEEZING
MY
BUTT
WITH
HER
