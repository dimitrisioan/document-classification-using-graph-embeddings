WHAT
DO
I
DO
WITH
OLD
GASOLINE
HELP
I
HAVE
A
WHICH
I
STOPPED
RIDING
ABOUT
YEARS
AGO
I
UPGRADED
TO
AN
SABRE
I
PARKED
IT
IN
THE
CORNER
OF
MY
PARKING
LOT
AND
PLANNED
ON
DRAINING
THE
GAS
SPRAYING
OIL
IN
THE
TANK
ETC
TO
GET
IT
READY
TO
STORE
WELL
AFTER
A
LOT
OF
PROCRASTINATION
ALL
I
ENDED
UP
DOING
WAS
THROWING
A
TARP
ON
IT
WELL
NOW
I
HAVE
TO
MOVE
AND
WANT
TO
CLEAN
UP
THE
I
TRIED
STARTING
IT
WITH
SOMEONE
ELSES
BATTERY
AND
HAD
NO
LUCK
MY
FIRST
GUESS
IS
THAT
IT
IS
THE
GAS
AND
SO
I
PLAN
ON
DRAINING
IT
AND
REPLACING
IT
WITH
NEW
GAS
I
CAN
ONLY
PRAY
THAT
I
DIDNT
TRASH
THE
CARBEURATORS
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHAT
DO
I
DO
WITH
THIS
OLD
GAS
I
AM
NOT
GOING
TO
RUN
IT
IN
MY
SABRE
AND
I
THINK
THAT
THERE
IS
ENOUGH
THAT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
BURN
IT
CAMPUS
POLICE
DONT
THINK
TOO
KINDLY
ABOUT
BONFIRES
DUMPING
IT
ISNT
A
GREAT
IDEA
THANKS
FOR
ANY
IDEAS
