what
do
i
do
with
old
gasoline
help
i
have
a
which
i
stopped
riding
about
years
ago
i
upgraded
to
an
sabre
i
parked
it
in
the
corner
of
my
parking
lot
and
planned
on
draining
the
gas
spraying
oil
in
the
tank
etc
to
get
it
ready
to
store
well
after
a
lot
of
procrastination
all
i
ended
up
doing
was
throwing
a
tarp
on
it
well
now
i
have
to
move
and
want
to
clean
up
the
i
tried
starting
it
with
someone
elses
battery
and
had
no
luck
my
first
guess
is
that
it
is
the
gas
and
so
i
plan
on
draining
it
and
replacing
it
with
new
gas
i
can
only
pray
that
i
didnt
trash
the
carbeurators
the
question
is
what
do
i
do
with
this
old
gas
i
am
not
going
to
run
it
in
my
sabre
and
i
think
that
there
is
enough
that
i
dont
want
to
burn
it
campus
police
dont
think
too
kindly
about
bonfires
dumping
it
isnt
a
great
idea
thanks
for
any
ideas
