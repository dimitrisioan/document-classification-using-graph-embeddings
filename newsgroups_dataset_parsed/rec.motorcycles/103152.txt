while
were
on
the
subject
has
anyone
else
noticed
that
the
deep
well
in
craftsmans
sae
deep
well
set
is
too
small
to
fit
a
bolt
or
nut
when
i
took
the
socket
in
for
an
exchange
every
one
of
the
deep
well
sockets
on
the
rack
had
the
exact
same
problem
not
to
imply
that
you
didnt
but
since
you
didnt
mention
it
did
you
measure
the
size
of
your
test
nut
with
callipers
were
all
three
cross
lengths
no
more
than
ive
seen
bolt
heads
and
even
a
few
nuts
which
got
slightly
thicker
further
down
toward
the
basa
sort
of
a
trapizodial
cross
section
that
i
did
not
do
however
the
sample
bolt
i
took
to
the
store
fit
rather
well
in
the
following
open
end
wrench
box
end
wrench
normal
socket
i
take
that
as
meaning
its
a
bolt
head
but
as
several
people
have
pointed
out
and
as
im
noting
in
the
tool
faq
im
writing
up
in
case
anyone
will
want
it
a
lifetime
guarantee
doesnt
necessiarly
mean
better
tools
yup
at
a
socket
i
want
the
thing
to
fit
later
