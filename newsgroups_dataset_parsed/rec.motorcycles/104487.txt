HUMPHREYS
WRITES
WHAT
IS
BUYING
A
BIKE
GOING
TO
DO
TO
MY
INSURANCE
I
TURN
IN
ABOUT
A
MONTH
SO
MY
PARENTS
HAVE
BEEN
TAKING
CARE
OF
MY
INSURANCE
UP
TILL
NOW
AND
I
NEED
A
COMPREHENSIVE
LIST
OF
COSTS
THAT
BUYING
A
MOTORCYCLE
IS
GOING
TO
INSURE
I
LIVE
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
IF
THAT
MAKES
A
DIFFERENCE
IT
DEPENDS
ON
THE
BIKE
ONCE
YOUVE
FOUND
A
BIKE
YOURE
INTERESTED
IN
CALL
SOME
INSURANCE
COMPANIES
FOR
RATES
SOME
BIKES
ARE
MUCH
CHEAPER
TO
INSURE
THAN
YOU
MIGHT
THINK
MY
ONLY
COSTS
ME
IN
ST
LOUIS
IM
ANY
RECOMMENDATIONS
ON
WHAT
I
SHOULD
BUYWHERE
I
SHOULD
LOOK
FOR
IT
FOR
A
FIRST
BIKE
I
RECOMMEND
OR
LESS
AND
A
BIKE
SHORT
ENOUGH
TO
GET
BOTH
FEET
ON
THE
GROUND
WHEN
YOU
STOP
THE
ONE
PIECE
OF
ADVICE
EVERYONE
WILL
GIVE
YOU
IS
TO
TAKE
A
MOTORCYCLE
SAFETY
FOUNDATION
RIDERS
COURSE
SEE
A
DEALER
FOR
DETAILS
IN
SOME
STATES
COMPLETION
OF
SUCH
A
COURSE
CAN
GIVE
YOU
A
BREAK
ON
INSURANCE
IT
WILL
ALSO
TEACH
YOU
TO
RIDE
PROPERLY
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
SO
YOU
WONT
LEARN
ANY
BAD
HABITS
GOOD
LUCK
RIDING
A
MOTORCYCLE
IS
THE
MOST
FUN
YOU
CAN
HAVE
NAKED
OR
OTHERWISE
ALAN
