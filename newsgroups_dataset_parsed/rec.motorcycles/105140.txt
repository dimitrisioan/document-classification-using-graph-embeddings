trying
to
figure
out
a
way
to
put
a
halogen
beam
on
my
are
nhthere
any
easy
ways
to
do
this
ie
a
slipin
bulb
replacement
no
the
honda
employed
a
sealed
beam
which
was
not
interchangeable
with
anything
else
so
far
as
i
could
ever
tell
ive
owned
two
over
the
years
and
that
was
always
one
of
my
biggest
nits
im
not
sure
how
far
standardisation
went
but
on
two
of
my
bikes
the
and
i
think
the
i
was
able
to
pop
a
cibie
insert
directly
into
the
original
housing
held
in
by
those
roughly
wshaped
springs
the
inserts
used
halogen
bulbs
and
were
great
although
mr
bill
later
indicates
that
this
may
be
too
much
of
a
drain
on
your
charging
system
