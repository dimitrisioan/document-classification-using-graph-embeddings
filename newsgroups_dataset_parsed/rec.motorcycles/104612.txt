CRAIG
A
VECHORIK
WRITES
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
THE
REASON
THAT
BMWS
COME
WITH
THOSE
EXPENSIVE
AND
RELATIVELY
WORTHLESS
SHORT
LIVED
VARDA
BATTERIES
IS
CAUSE
BMW
OWNS
A
CONTROLING
INTEREST
IN
THAT
BATTERY
MANUFACTURER
WHATS
WRONG
WITH
THE
BMW
BATTERY
IVE
NEVER
HAD
PROBLEMS
AND
I
KNOW
NUMEROUS
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
STILL
USING
THE
ORIGINAL
BATTERY
IN
THERE
YEAR

THE

IN
AN

WAS
A
DISASTER

ACC
TOLD
ME
THAT

WOULD
WARANTEE
REPLACE
THE
BAD
ONE
WITH
A
NEW
ONE
OF
THE

EVIL
BAD
BATTERIES
AND
TELL
THE
CUSTOMER
IF
THEY
HAVE
PROBLEMS
TO
BRING
IT
BACK
AND
THEYD
DO
IT
AGAIN
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MANY
OF
THOSE
BATTERIES
WERE
DOA
NEARDOA
AND
ALWAYS
UNLIKELY
TO
BE
GOING
STRONG
BY
THE
END
OF
THE
WARANTEE
PERIOD

THEM
THERE
WAS
A
BIG
BATCH
OF
BAD
ONES
