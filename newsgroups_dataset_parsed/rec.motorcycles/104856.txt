WROTE
SQUIDS
I
FELT
EMBARASSED
AT
THIS
POINT
TO
BE
A
MOTORCYCLIST
I
FELT
THE
EYES
OF
THOSE
IN
CAGES
WITNESSING
THIS
DISPLAY
THEN
GLANCING
OVER
TO
THE
DEALERS
LOT
AND
DAMNING
ALL
THOSE
ON
TWO
WHEELS
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
MY
FRIEND
FELT
A
LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE
AND
WE
LEFT
DID
YOU
EXPRESS
YOUR
EMBARRASSMENT
TO
THE
OWNER
I
DONT
BLAME
YOU
FOR
BEING
EMBARRASSED
BUT
I
WOULD
HAVE
LET
MY
FEELING
BE
KNOWN
THAT
THE
BEHAVIOUR
OF
THEIR
SALES
STAFF
AND
APPARENT
ENJOYMENT
OF
SUCH
BEHAVIOUR
JUST
COST
THEM
A
SALE
AND
ALL
FURTHER
SALES
I
WILL
NOW
TURN
OFF
MY
FRUSTRATION
AND
GO
RIDE
PEACEFULLY
TO
CLEAR
MY
ANGER
I
ONLY
HOPE
THAT
THE
COP
WHO
IS
FOLLOWING
ME
HOME
HAS
AN
OPEN
MIND
AND
DOESNT
ASSOCIATE
ME
WITH
THEM
SOUND
GOOD
ENJOY
BTW
I
CANT
AFFORD
A
NEW
BIKE
WHO
CAN
MERF
