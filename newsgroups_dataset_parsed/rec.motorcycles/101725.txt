suggest
mcquires
plastic
polish
it
will
help
somewhat
but
nothing
will
remove
deep
scratches
without
making
it
worse
than
it
already
is
mcquires
will
do
something
for
fine
or
light
stuff
also
suggest
calling
your
local
plastic
shop
in
calif
tap
plastic
is
a
chain
that
carries
most
of
what
is
needed
for
repair
and
sometimes
replacement
of
plastic
bits
telephone
in
the
bay
area
is
im
not
sure
how
amenable
they
are
to
shipping
i
have
found
that
they
have
several
excellent
products
for
cleaning
and
removing
crap
from
windscreens
and
face
shields
also
they
have
one
called
liftit
which
works
real
well
in
removing
sticky
stuffs
such
as
adhessives
from
plastic
wihtout
scratching
same
luck
