NICK
PETTEFAR
WRITES
WITH
REGARDS
TO
THE
PUB
BRAWL
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
A
HISTORY
OF
SUCH
THINGS
JUST
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
A
BIKER
DOESNT
MAKE
HIM
OUT
TO
BE
A
REASONABLE
PERSON
EVEN
THE
DOD
MIGHT
OBJECT
TO
HIM
JOINING
WHO
KNOWS
IF
HE
HAD
A
HISTORY
OF
SUCH
THINGS
WHY
WAS
IT
NOT
MENTIONED
IN
THE
ARTICLE
AND
WHY
DID
THEY
PRESENT
THE
IRRELEVANT
DETAIL
OF
WHERE
HE
GOT
HIS
DRINKING
MONEY
FROM
I
CANT
SAY
EXACTLY
WHO
IS
AT

FROM
WHERE

LOOKS
LIKE
WERE
SEEING
THE

EITHER
OF

GOING

OUT

OR
OF
SHODDY
JOURNALISM
IF
THE
LAW
WANTS
TO
ATTACH
STRINGS
TO
HOW
YOU
SPEND
A
SETTLEMENT
THEY
SHOULD
PUT
THE
MONEY
IN
TRUST
THEY
DONT
SO
I
WOULD
ASSUME
ITS
PERFECTLY
LEGITIMATE
TO
DRINK
IT
AWAY
THOUGH
I
WOULDNT
SPEND
IT
THAT
WAY
