MY
TAPPITS
SHEPPAMJSUNSOECLARKSONEDU
MATTHEW
SHEPPARD
WRITES
ALL
OUR
LOCAL
EXPERTS
SAY
ITS
THE
TAPPITS
THAT
NEED
SOME
ADJUSTING
SO
I
AM
SOON
TO
ATTEMPT
THAT
I
WOULD
LIKE
ANY
ADVICE
ANYONE
HAD
IF
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
AS
ADJUSTING
THE
SHIMS
BETWEEN
CAM
AND
VALVE
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
QUESTION
DO
YOU
BUY
A
FULL
SET
OF
SHIMS
BEFORE
STARTING
THE
ADJUSTMENT
PROCESS
OR
DO
YOU
CALCULATE
THE
SHIMS
YOU
NEED
AND
THEN
RUN
OFF
TO
THE
DEALER
IN
THE
CAGE
TO
SEE
IF
THE
RIGHT
SHIMS
ARE
IN
STOCK
OBVIOUSLY
THE
LATTER
WOULD
BE
CHEAPER
WHAT
DO
SHIMS
COST
BUT
ARE
MEASUREMENTS
OF
THE
SHIM
NEED
RELIABLE
ENOUGH
TO
BUY
ONLY
THE
INDICATED
SHIMS
