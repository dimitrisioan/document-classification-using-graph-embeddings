hey
ed
how
do
you
explain
the
fact
that
you
pull
on
a
horses
reins
left
to
go
left
or
am
i
confusing
two
threads
here
three
actually
i
believe
i
discussed
countersteering
a
horse
before
basically
there
are
two
ways
to
steer
a
horse
plowrein
and
neckrein
plowreining
steers
him
by
keeping
the
reins
separate
and
you
pull
in
the
direction
you
wish
to
go
neckreining
steers
a
horse
by
holding
the
reins
together
in
one
hand
and
pulling
against
the
horses
neck
in
the
direction
you
wish
to
go
when
training
a
plowsteering
horse
to
neckrein
one
technique
is
to
cross
the
reins
under
his
necks
thus
when
neckreining
to
the
left
the
right
rein
pulls
against
the
right
side
of
the
neck
but
the
left
side
of
the
bit
which
the
horse
is
used
to
from
his
plowreining
days
are
you
sorry
you
asked
yet
