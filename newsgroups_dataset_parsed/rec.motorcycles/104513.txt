NORMAN
HAMER
SAYS
IF
I
DONT
END
UP
REPLACING
IT
IN
THE
REAL
NEAR
FUTURE
WOULD
I
DO
BETTER
TO
WEAR
MY
TOTALLY
NONDAMAGED
FACE
DOTRATED
CHEAPIE
WHICH
DOESNT
FIT
AS
WELL
OR
KEEP
OUT
THE
WIND
AS
WELL
OR
WEARING
THE
SHOEI
WHICH
IS
A
LOT
MORE
COMFORTABLE
KEEPS
THE
WIND
OUT
BETTER
IS
QUIETER
BUT
MIGHT
HAVE
SOME
MINOR
DAMAGE
WEAR
THE
EVEN
AFTER
A
FEW
DROPS
PAINT
CHIPS
IT
IS
FAR
BETTER
THAN
NO
HELMET
OR
A
POORLY
FITTING
ONE
IVE
HAD
MANY
SCRATCHES
BANGS
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
REPAIRED
PLUS
IM
STILL
CONFIDENT
OF
THE
PROTECTION
THE
HELMET
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
GIVE
ME
ONLY
WHEN
YOU
ACTUALLY
SEE
DEPRESSIONS
OR
ACTUAL
CRACKS
USING
A
MAGNIFYING
GLASS
SHOULD
YOU
CONSIDER
REPLACEMENT
THIS
IS
NOT
GOOD
ADVICE
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
I
WAS
INVOLVED
IN
A
LOWSPEED
GETOFF
IN
WHICH
I
LANDED
ON
MY
BACK
ON
THE
PAVEMENT
MY
HEAD
HELMETED
HIT
THE
PAVEMENT
WITH
A
CLUNK
LEAVING
A
COUPLE
OF
DINGS
AND
CHIPS
IN
THE
PAINT
AT
THE
POINT
OF
IMPACT
BUT
NO
OTHER
VISIBLE
DAMAGE
I
CALLED
THE
HELMET
MANUFACTURER
AND
INQUIRED
ABOUT
DAMAGE
THEY
SAID
THAT
THE
WAY
A
FIBERGLASS
SHELL
WORKS
IS
TO
FIRST
GIVE
THEN
DELAMINATE
THEN
CRACK
THIS
IS
THE
WAY
FIBERGLASS
SERVES
TO
SPREAD
THE
FORCE
OF
THE
IMPACT
OVER
A
WIDER
AREA
AFTER
THE
FIBERGLASS
HAS
DONE
ITS
THING
THE
CRUSHABLE
FOAM
LINER
TAKES
CARE
OF
ABSORBING
HOPEFULLY
THE
REMAINING
IMPACT
FORCE
THEY
TOLD
ME
THAT
THE
SECOND
STAGE
OF
FIBERGLASS
FUNCTIONALITY
DELAMINATION
OF
THE
GLASSRESIN
LAYERS
CAN
OCCUR
WITH
NO
VISIBLE
SIGNS
EITHER
INSIDE
OR
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
HELMET
THEY
SUGGESTED
THAT
I
SEND
THEM
THE
HELMET
AND
THEY
WOULD
INSPECT
IT
INCLUDING
XRAYING
I
DID
SO
THEY
SENT
BACK
THE
HELMET
WITH
A
LETTER
STATING
THAT
THAT
THEY
COULD
FIND
NO
DAMAGE
THAT
WOULD
COMPROMISE
THE
ABILITY
OF
THE
HELMET
TO
PROVIDE
MAXIMUM
PROTECTION
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THIS
LETTER
WOULD
ELIMINATE
THEIR
BEING
ABLE
TO
CLAIM
PRIOR
DAMAGE
TO
THE
HELMET
IN
THE
EVENT
I
WERE
TO
SUE
THEM
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
THOUGH
IS
THAT
IT
APPEARS
THAT
A
HELMETS
INTEGRITY
CAN
BE
COMPROMISED
WITH
NO
VISIBLE
SIGNS
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
KNOW
FOR
SURE
IS
TO
SEND
IT
BACK
AND
HAVE
IT
INSPECTED
NOTE
THAT
SOME
HELMET
MANUFACTURERS
PROVIDE
INSPECTIONS
SERVICES
AND
SOME
DO
NOT
ANOTHER
POINT
TO
CONSIDER
WHEN
PURCHASING
A
LID
KEN
FRANKLIN
THEY
SAY
THERES
A
HEAVEN
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
WAIT
AMA
AND
SOME
SAY
ITS
BETTER
BUT
I
SAY
IT
AINT
GWRRA
ID
RATHER
LAUGH
WITH
THE
SINNERS
THAN
CRY
WITH
THE
SAINTS
DOD
THE
SINNERS
ARE
LOTS
MORE
FUN
YKNOW
ONLY
THE
GOOD
DIE
YOUNG
