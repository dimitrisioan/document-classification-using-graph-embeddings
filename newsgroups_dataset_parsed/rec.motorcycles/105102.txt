if

any
repeat
of
this
sort
of
thing
now
in
keeping
with
the
grand
tradition
of
wreckmoto
lets
mutate
take
your
partners
by
the
hand
on
tuesday
morning
i
spent
a
couple
of
hours
when
i
should
have
been
working
with
a
torch
brazing
bits
of
scrap
metal
over
the
biggest
holes
in
yamadogs
exhaust
pipes
smazin
what
you
can
do
with
a
couple
of
aa
cells
and
a
threevolt
bulb
i
stuck
some
gungum
into
the
smaller
holes
and
bunged
the
pipes
back
onto
the
bike
so
last
night
im
on
the
way
home
when
lo
an
bloody
behold
the
sodding
thing
starts
blowing
again
i
check
it
out
and
the
gas
is
escaping
from
around
the
clamp
holding
the
number
two
pipe
into
the
port
as
far
as
i
can
see
it
being
somewhat
hole
of
calcutta
at
the
time
the
nuts
are
still
there
stop
that
bloody
sniggering
you
at
the
back
but
the
pipe
is
a
bit
loose
this
morning
i
go
out
to
the
bike
and
pull
out
the
socketset
to
tighten
up
me
nuts
somebody
give
that
spotty
kid
at
the
back
a
good
slap
round
the
back
of
the
head
and
lo
an
bloody
behold
abloodygen
i
find
that
the
outer
skin
of
the
pipe
has
separated
from
the
inner
sleeve
right
at
the
clampmating
bevel
so
i
stuff
in
a
bit
of
bakedbeanz
can
and
a
bit
more
of
mr
holts
very
best
gungum
and
come
to
work
late
again
so
that
i
can
ask
of
the
oracle
will
a
brazed
joint
hold
that
close
to
the
exhaust
port
anybody
tried
it
oh
and
if
anybody
can
tell
me
what
the
differences
are
between
a
and
a
brazing
rod
