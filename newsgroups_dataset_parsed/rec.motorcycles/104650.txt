ANDREW
INFANTE
WRITES
WELL
AS
A
FEW
OF
YOU
SO
APTLY
PUT
IT
GET
OFF
THE
ROAD
JERK
WE
DONT
WANNA
HEAR
YOUR
WHINING
FINE
FUCK
OFF
TOO
IF
YOU
NOTICED
IT
WAS
IN
MORE
THAN
TWO
YEARS
AGO
AND
YES
IVE
LEARNED
AND
ITS
COST
ME
AND
YES
IVE
KNOWN
PEOPLE
FRIENDS
AND
RELATIVES
WHOVE
BEEN
INVOLVED
IN
DRUNKRELATED
ACCIDENTS
NOT
THEM
THEY
WERE
HIT
AND
MY
COUSIN
IS
STILL
RECOVERING
NO
I
CANT
TAKE
BACK
WHAT
HAPPENED
YES
IT
WAS
STUPID
BUT
BY
REMINDING
ME
ABOUT
IT
ALL
THE
TIME
YOURE
NEITHER
HELPING
ME
OR
YOURSELF
SO
STUFF
YOUR
OPINION
HEY
MAN
YOU
BROUGHT
IT
UP
I
AGREE
COMPLETELY
DRIVING
DRUNK
IS
REALLY
STUPID
AND
I
UNDERSTAND
AND
APPRECIATE
THAT
YOU
FEEL
BAD
ABOUT
IT
BUT
DWI
IS
ENDEMIC
IN
OUR
SOCIETY
IT
IS
A
REAL
PROBLEM
AND
WE
AS
MOTORCYCLISTS
CAN
BE
IN
THE
WORST
OF
VULNERABLE
POSITIONS
AROUND
A
DRUNK
DRIVER
ALERT
READERS
MIGHT
REMEMBER
THAT
LAST
YEAR
I
WITNESSED
A
DWI
ACCIDENT
RIGHT
BLOODY
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
AND
WAS
UNABLE
TO
SAVE
THE
LIFE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
PARTICIPANTS
AS
I
REPORTED
HERE
ALSO
DRUNK
DRIVING
BY
MOTORCYCLISTS
IS
A
PRIME
CAUSE
OF
THEIR
INJURY
AND
DEATH
WHICH
RAISES
THE
INSURANCE
RATES
FORCES
STUPIDLY
RESTRICTIVE
LAWS
AND
TURNS
THE
PUBLIC
AGAINST
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
RIDE
RESPONSIBLY
IN
MY
VIEW
DRUNK
DRIVING
SHOULD
CARRY
A
MANDATORY
PRISON
SENTENCE
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
TRAFFIC
OFFENSES
WHICH
IS
NOT
A
PUBLIC
FUNDS
ISSUE
BUT
A
GENUINE
SAFETY
ISSUE
SO
IF
YOU
BRING
UP
THE
SUBJECT
ON
RECMOTO
ADMITTING
HAVING
BEEN
CAUGHT
DWI
AND
LOOKING
FOR
SYMPATHY
OVER
THE
CONSEQUENCES
DONT
EXPECT
PEOPLE
TO
RESPOND
WITH
WARM
WISHES
DAVE
SVOBODA
SVOBODAVOIDRTSGMOTCOM
IM
GETTING
TIRED
OF
YOU
AND
THE
BEAV
SHOULD
LIGHTEN
UP
ESP
THE
BEAV
I
AGREE
THAT
DUIDWI
IS
SERIOUS
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
REASONABLE
LAWS
STRICT
ENFORCEMENT
AND
TOUGH
SENTENCES
BUT
ANDREW
DID
NOT
POST
LOOKING
FOR
SYMPATHY
OVER
THE
CONSEQUENCES
HE
POSTED
ASKING
FOR
ADVICE
BECAUSE
HE
HAD
AN
EXTREMELY
HIGH
QUOTE
HIS
POST
WAS
OBVIOUSLY
VALID
BECAUSE
HE
LATER
FOUND
INSURANCE
FOR
LESS
HE
NOTED
WHY
HE
WAS
IN
HIS
PREDICAMENT
BUT
DID
NOT
DEFEND
IN
ANY
WAY
DRUNK
DRIVING
AND
HAS
RENOUNCED
DRUNK
DRIVING
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
REPEAT
OFFENDERS
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
AND
OTHER
BDC
WHY
TRY
TO
MAKE
THIS
PERSON
WHO
IS
NO
LONGER
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
AN
OUTCAST
HE
HAS
PAID
HIS
DEBT
TO
SOCIETY
STEP
OFF
THE
HIGH
HORSE
WE
HAVE
ALL
BEEN
IRRESPONSIBLE
IN
THE
PAST
WITH
THAT
SAID
IM
GUILTY
OF
THE
SAME
TYPE
OF
HOSTILITY
TOWARDS
RAPISTS
I
THINK
IT
COMES
BECAUSE
I
FEEL
THE
PUNISHMENT
IS
NOT
SEVERE
ENOUGH
THE
SAME
MAY
BE
TRUE
OF
DWIDUI
IF
THAT
IS
THE
CASE
THEN
IT
IS
OUR
STINKIN
GUBMENT
WE
NEED
TO
CHANGE
IF
WE
HAD
A
REASONABLE
LAW
ABOUT
DWIDUI
WITH
A
STIFF
PENALTY
THEN
FEWER
PEOPLE
WOULD
DO
IT
AT
ANY
RATE
ANDREW
AS
PAID
HIS
DEBT
AS
DEFINED
BY
THE
LAW
IF
YOU
THINK
THAT
DEBT
IS
ACTUALLY
GREATER
THAN
THE
LAW
MANDATES
TELL
YOUR
REPRESENTATIVES
JACK
WATERS
II
I
DONT
FEAR
THE
THIEF
IN
THE
NIGHT
ITS
THE
ONE
THAT
COMES
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
WHEN
IM
STILL
ASLEEP
THAT
I
WORRY
ABOUT
