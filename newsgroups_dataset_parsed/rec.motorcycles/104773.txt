PARTIAL
ENGINE
DISASSEMBLY
MY
KAWASAKI
KZ
HAS
MILLIMETRES
OF
PLAY
ON
THE
GEARCHANGE
PEDAL
AXLE
IN
OTHER
WORDS
I
CAN
MOVE
THE
AXLE
SIDEWAYS
UPANDDOWN
FOR
FEW
MILLIMETRES
TO
EACH
DIRECTION
THIS
DOESNT
BOTHER
ME
WHEN
RIDING
BUT
I
GUESS
FIXING
IT
WOULDNT
HURT
LAST
SUMMER
I
TOOK
THE
BIKE
TO
A
SHOP
TO
HAVE
THE
VALVES
ADJUSTED
AND
THE
MECHANIC
MENTIONED
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
AN
EASY
JOB
ALL
I
WOULD
HAVE
TO
DO
IS
TO
REMOVE
THE
FRONT
SPROCKET
COVER
AND
REPLACE
A
BUSHING
OR
A
SEAL
THAT
I
WOULD
FIND
THERE
WELL
UPON
A
CLOSER
INSPECTION
I
DISCOVERED
THAT
THE
GEARCHANGE
AXLE
DOESNT
EVEN
RUN
THROUGH
THE
SPROCKET
COVER
IT
SEEMS
THAT
IN
ADDITION
TO
REMOVING
THE
COVER
I
WOULD
HAVE
AT
LEAST
TO
REMOVE
THE
SPROCKET
AND
THEN
THE
COVER
THAT
IS
BEHIND
THE
SPROCKET
QUESTION
WOULD
REMOVING
THIS
SMALL
COVER
FROM
THE
LEFT
SIDE
OF
THE
ENGINE
ENABLE
ME
TO
LAY
MY
HANDS
ON
THAT
BUSHINGSEAL
DONT
KNOW
THE
EXACT
TERM
IN
ENGLISH
SORRY
QUESTION
HAS
ANYBODY
DONE
THIS
DISASSEMBLY
JOB
FOR
THIS
OR
SOME
OTHER
PURPOSE
DOES
THE
OIL
FOR
EXAMPLE
STAY
INSIDE
THE
ENGINE
