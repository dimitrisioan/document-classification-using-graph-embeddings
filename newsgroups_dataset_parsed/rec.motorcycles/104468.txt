LOUD
PIPES
ARE
A
BILIGERENT
EXERCISE
IN

PROJECTION
NO
ARGUEMENTS
FOLLOWING
JUST
THE
FACTS
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
AVOID
AN
ACCIDENT
BY
REVVING
MY
ENGINE
AND
HAVING
MY
STOCK
HARLEY
PIPES
MAKE
ENOUGH
NOISE
TO
DRAW
SOMEONES
ATTENTION
I
INSTINCTIVELY
REVVED
MY
ENGINE
BEFORE
I
WENT
FOR
MY
HORN
DONT
KNOW
WHY
BUT
I
DID
IT
AND
IT
WORKED
THATS
RATHER
IMPORTANT
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THE
LOUDER
THE
PIPES
THE
BETTER
MY
HARLEY
IS
LOUD
AND
IT
GETS
ME
NOTICED
ON
THE
ROAD
FOR
THAT
REASON
I
PERSONALLY
DO
NOT
FEEL
IT
IS
TO
LOUD

WELCOME

IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
A
FINE

MACHINE
LIKE
OUR
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
TO
GET
INVOLVED
AND
PASS
DB
RESTRICTIONS
IT
SHOULD
BE
GENEROUS
ENOUGH
SO
THAT
A
MOVE
LIKE
REVVING
YOUR
ENGINE
WILL
GET
YOU
NOTICED
SURE
THERE
ARE
HORNS
BUT
MY
HAND
IS
ALREADY
ON
THE
THROTTLE
SHOULD
WE
GET

GOES

HOW
LONG
IT
WOULD
TAKE
ME
TO
PUSH
MY

AND
