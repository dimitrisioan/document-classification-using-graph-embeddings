DOGS
VS
BIKES
DOGS
WILL
CHASE
ANYTHING
THAT
MOVES
I
HAVE
TWO
DOGS
AND
THEY
LOVE
CHASING
ME

I
RIDE
OFF
THEY
WILL
ALSO
CHASE
ANY
CAR
THAT
PASSES
RUNNING
ALONG
THE
FOOTPATHSIDEWALK
AT
UP
TO
THEY
DONT
SEEM
TO
GO
AFTER
TRUCKS
THOUGH
THE
SIZE
DIFFERENCE
MUST
BE
A
FACTOR
IT
ALSO
WORKS
IN
MY
FAVOUR
THOUGH
I
CAN
EXERCISE
THEM
QUITE
EASILY
BY
RIDING
MILE
UP
THE
ROAD
AND
BACK
