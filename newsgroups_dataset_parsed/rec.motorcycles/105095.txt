EXTRAORDINARY
FOOTPEG
ENGINEERING
OKAY
DODERS
HERES
A
GODDAMN
MYSTERY
FOR
YA
TODAY
I
WAS
TURNING
A
DEGREE
CORNER
JUST
LIKE
ON
ANY
OTHER
DAY
BUT
THERE
WAS
A
SLIGHT
DIFFERENCE
A
ROUGH
SPOT
RIGHT
IN
MY
PATH
CAUSED
THE
SUSPENSION
TO
COMPRESS
IN
MID
CORNER
AND
SOME
PART
OF
THE
BIKE
HIT
THE
GROUND
WITH
A
VERY
TANGIBLE
THUNK
I
PULLED
OVER
AT
FIRST
OPPORTUNITY
TO
SUS
OUT
THE
DAMAGE
MY
BIKE
IS
A
KAWASAKI
WITH
FOOTPEGS
THAT
ARE
HINGED
AND
SPRUNG
SUCH
THAT
THEY
FOLD
UPWARD
AND
BACKWARD
ON
CONTACT
WITH
GROUND
ETC
AND
ON
THE
LOWER
EXTREME
CORNER
OF
EACH
PEG
THERE
IS
MOUNTED
A
BANKFOLLOWER
OR
A
LITTLE
STUD
THAT
THEORETICALLY
IS
THE
FIRST
BIT
TO
HIT
THE
GROUND
IN
A
TURN
THE
STUD
IS
MOUNTED
ON
THE
FOOTPEG
BY
A
THREADED
BIT
ABOUT
MM
LONG
WHICH
SCREWS
INTO
A
THREADED
HOLE
IN
THE
FOOTPEG
NOW
FOR
THE
MYSTERY
THE
STUD
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BIKE
THAT
CLUNKED
WHEN
I
TURNED
WAS
ABSENT
IM
FAIRLY
SURE
IT
WAS
THERE
BEFORE
THE
EVENT
THERE
WAS
NO
DAMAGE
TO
THE
END
OF
THE
FOOTPEG
WHERE
THE
STUD
WOULD
ORDINARILY
HAVE
BEEN
IN
FACT
THE
THREAD
IN
THE
HOLE
IN
THE
FOOTPEG
WAS
PERFECTLY
INTACT
WITH
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
SOMETHING
HAVING
BEEN
FORCEFULLY
RIPPED
OUT
OF
IT
ONLY
MOMENTS
PREVIOUSLY
OKAY
ALL
YOU
ENGINEERING
TYPES
HOW
THE
FK
DO
YOU
EXPLAIN
THIS
HOW
CAN
YOU
RIP
A
TIGHTLY
FITTING
STEEL
THREAD
OUT
OF
A
THREADED
HOLE
IN
ALLOY
WITHOUT
DAMAGING
THE
THREAD
IN
THE
HOLE
IS
THIS
SOME
SORT
OF
HITECH
DESIGN
THINGO
THAT
KAWASAKI
NEVER
MENTIONED
LIKE
THAT
THE
END
OF
THE
FOOTPEG
SUDDENLY
CHANGES
PHASE
ON
IMPACT
TO
LET
THE
STUD
RIP
OUT
THEN
CHANGES
BACK
TO
A
SOLID
IM
QUITE
AMAZED
AT
HOW
THIS
COULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
IN
THE
MEANTIME
LIFE
GOES
ON
WITHOUT
A
LEFTHAND
BANKFOLLOWER
BARRY
