TO
MIND
VERY
QUICKLY
WITH
CINDY
ON
THE
BACK
WAS
SHE
ON
THE
BACK
HARD
TO
TELL
WITH
SEAT
THREE
TIMES
AS
LARGE
AS
A
HAWK
SEAT
THE
BIKE
SEEMED
NEARLY
OUT
OF
CONTROL
JUST
IDLING
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
IT
IS
HEAVY
THE
IS
MID
DRY
THAT
IS
THE
ONE
MAJOR
DRAWBACK
OF
THE
ST
BY
RPM
IN
SECOND

ALL

SEEMED

DISSAPPEAR

A
BIG

IS
REQUIRED
TO
MOVE
THIS
THING
RESPONDS
WELL
THOUGH
NO
WALLOWING
OR
COMPLAINT
BEHIND
THE

IT
WAS
FAIRLY

NOT
SURE
WHAT
THE

BUT
IT
IS
PLEASANT
THIS
IS
THE
ESSENCE
OF

MOVE
THE
THROTTLE
AND
ITR
ACCELERATES
ANY

FREQUENTLY

DURING
A
CASUAL

MANEUVER
THE

A
REAL

THIS
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF

YOU
HAVE
TO
BE
AGGRESIVE
WITH
THE

SQUEZE
ACTUALLY
AS
TESTED
BY
CYCLE
WORLD
AND
AN
EXPERT
RIDER
THE
ST
STOPPED
FASTER
THEN
THE
COMPARABLE
MODELS
FROM
BMW
AND
YAMAHA
EVEN
WITH
THE
EXTRA
WEIGHT
AND
GAS
THE
SECTION
OF
WE
WERE
ON
WAS
TIGHT
BUT
TOO
URBAN
THE
ST
WORKS
OK
IN
THIS
SECTION
BUT
IT
SHOWS
ITS
WEIGHT
WE
WENT
BY
THE
CLAM
SHACK
YOU
MUST
COUNTERSTEER
THE
ST
FOR
EVERY
TURN
AND
MOVEMENT
SHORT
OF
THE
CLASSIC
POTHOLE
WIGGLE
JUST
FORGET
EVER
LEANING
INTO
A
TURN
AGAIN
IT
MUST
BE
COUNTERSTEERED
INTO
EVERY
TURN
AND
THEN
RESPONDS
NICELY
ABOUT
HALF

THROUGH

I
YANKED

WITH
A
SHORT

INTO

ON
THE
WAY
TO
WE
SAW
NO
COPS
AND
VERY
LIGHT
TRAFFIC
DID
NOT
CROSS
INTO
DOD
ZONE
BECAUSE
THE
BIKE
WAS
TOO
NEW
WELL
NOW
IT
HAD
MILES
ON
IT
SO
IT
WAS
OK
TRIED

SOME

SWEEPING
TURNS
TIME
TO
WICK
IT
UP
I
WENT
UNTIL
THE
BUFFETING
WAS
THREATING
TO
PULL
US
OFF
THE
SEAT
AND
STAYED
THERE
WHEN
I
WAS
COMFORTABLE
WITH
THE
WIND
AND
THE
STEERING
I
LOOKED
DOWN
TO
FIND
AN
INDICATED
NOT
BAD
FOR
TOURING
FASTER
THEN
IVE
EVER
GONE
I
D
HATE
TO
BUY
THIS
BIKE
AFTER
YOUR
SHORT
BREAK
IN
PERIOD
TO
THREAD
THE

THROUGH
THE
CARS
TO
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
CONCRETE
PAD
OUT
FRONT
HEAVY
IT
TOOK
WAY
TOO
MUCH
EFFORT
FOR
CINDY
AND
I
TO
PUT
THE
THING
ON
THE
CENTER
STAND
I
AM
SURE
THAT
IF
I
USED
THE
SIDE
STAND
THE
ST
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
ON
ITS
SIDE
WITHIN
A
MINUTE
NOT
TRUE
THE
SIDE
STAND
IS
WELL
DESIGNED
FOR
THE
WEIGHT
AND
WILL
HOLD
THE
BIKE
NICELY
ON
DIRT
I
AM
ABLE
TO
EASILY
GET
THE
BIKE
UP
ON
THE
CENTER
STAND
JUST
STEP
DOWN
ON
THE
STAND
INSTEAD
OF
PULLING
UP

SMOOTH
COMFORTABLE
HARDLY
NOTICES
THE

LESS

JUST
LIKE
