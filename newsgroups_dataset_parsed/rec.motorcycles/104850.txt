well
i
was
wrong
as
i
sat
on
the
st
both
feet
down
all
i
could
think
was
big
then
i
put
one
foot
up
heavy
came
to
mind
very
quickly
with
cindy
on
the
back
was
she
on
the
back
hard
to
tell
with
seat
three
times
as
large
as
a
hawk
seat
the
bike
seemed
nearly
out
of
control
just
idling
on
the
side
of
the
road
it
is
heavy
the
is
mid
dry
that
is
the
one
major
drawback
of
the
st
by
rpm
in
second
gear
all
the
weight
seemed
to
dissappear
even
can
you
say
tourque
monster
the
test
drive
sold
me
on
the
bike
lots
of
bite
anywhere
above
in
any
gear
on
bike
with
miles
on
the
odometer
slippery
new
tires
and
pads
that
did
you
trythe
abstcs
version
cindy
has
no
difficulty
with
speed
gear
gear
purring
along
in
top
gear
this
thing
has
less
low
rpm
grunt
that
my
hawk
lane
changes
were
a
new
experience
a
big
heft
is
required
to
move
this
thing
responds
well
though
no
wallowing
or
complaint
behind
the
fairing
it
was
fairly
quiet
but
the
helmet
buffeting
was
after
market
fairing
windshield
for
raises
the
bubble
inches
above
most
heads
but
hurts
the
looks
of
the
bike
nontrivial
top
gear
car
passing
at
was
nearly
effortless
smooth
smooth
smooth
not
sure
what
the
sound
reminds
me
of
but
it
is
pleasant
this
is
the
essence
of
the
bike
move
the
throttle
and
itr
accelerates
any
gear
anywhere
anytime
i
frequently
find
myself
at
the
dod
min
during
a
casual
passing
maneuver
the
jump
on
to
caused
me
to
be
less
than
impressed
with
the
brakes
its
a
down
hill
reversing
camber
twicereversing
radius
decreasing
radius
turn
a
real
squeeze
is
needed
on
the
front
binder
this
is
a
function
of
the
weight
you
have
to
be
aggresive
with
the
brake
squeze
actually
as
tested
by
cycle
world
and
an
expert
rider
the
st
stopped
faster
then
the
comparable
models
from
bmw
and
yamaha
even
with
the
extra
weight
and
gas
the
section
of
we
were
on
was
tight
but
too
urban
the
st
works
ok
in
this
section
but
it
shows
its
weight
we
went
by
the
clam
shack
you
must
countersteer
the
st
for
every
turn
and
movement
short
of
the
classic
pothole
wiggle
just
forget
ever
leaning
into
a
turn
again
it
must
be
countersteered
into
every
turn
and
then
responds
nicely
about
half
way
through
the
onramp
i
yanked
cindys
wrist
our
singal
for
hold
on
tight
head
check
left
time
to
find
redline
second
gear
gives
a
good
shove
third
too
fourth
sees
dod
speed
with
a
short
shift
into
top
on
the
way
to
we
saw
no
cops
and
very
light
traffic
did
not
cross
into
dod
zone
because
the
bike
was
too
new
well
now
it
had
miles
on
it
so
it
was
ok
tried
some
high
effort
lane
changes
some
wide
sweeping
turns
time
to
wick
it
up
i
went
until
the
buffeting
was
threating
to
pull
us
off
the
seat
and
stayed
there
when
i
was
comfortable
with
the
wind
and
the
steering
i
looked
down
to
find
an
indicated
not
bad
for
touring
faster
then
ive
ever
gone
i
d
hate
to
buy
this
bike
after
your
short
break
in
period
to
thread
the
st
through
the
cars
to
the
edge
of
the
concrete
pad
out
front
heavy
it
took
way
too
much
effort
for
cindy
and
i
to
put
the
thing
on
the
center
stand
i
am
sure
that
if
i
used
the
side
stand
the
st
would
have
been
on
its
side
within
a
minute
not
true
the
side
stand
is
well
designed
for
the
weight
and
will
hold
the
bike
nicely
on
dirt
i
am
able
to
easily
get
the
bike
up
on
the
center
stand
just
step
down
on
the
stand
instead
of
pulling
up
on
the
bike
my
demo
opinion
heavy
put
it
on
a
diet
smooth
comfortable
hardly
notices
the
dod
speed
id
buy
on
for
about
less
than
list
just
like
it
is
too
much
for
the
bike
as
it
is
keep
looking
the
left
overs
if
available
are
going
for
i
love
mine
and
i
havent
found
a
better
value
then
the
st
for
remember
you
get
years
unlimited
mileage
warranty
