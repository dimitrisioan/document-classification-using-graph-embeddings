NIELS
MIKKEL
MICHELSEN
WRITES
THE
OTHER
DAY
IT
WAS
RAINING
CATS
AND
DOGS
THEREFOR
I
WAS
GOING
ONLY
TO
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
ON
NOTHING
MORE
ON
MY
BIKE
THIS
GUY
IN
HIS
BMW
WAS
DRIVING
METERS
BEHIND
ME
FOR
METERS
AND
AT
THE
NEXT
RED
LIGHT
I
CALMLY
PUT
THE
BIKE
ON
ITS
LEG
WALKED
BACK
TO
THIS
CAR
HE
ROLLED
DOWN
THE
WINDOW
AND
I
TOLD
HIM
HE
WAS
A
TOTAL
IDIOT
AND
THE
REASON
WHY
DID
I
DO
THE
RIGHT
THING
WELL
I
USED
TO
GET
MAD
AND
EITHER
TRY
TO
COMMUNICATE
MY
ANGER
TO
JERKS
OR
TO
UHM
EDUCATE
THEM
IN
HOW
TO
IMPROVE
THEIR
MANNERS
IN
TRAFFIC
NOW
I
JUST
TRY
TO
GET
THEM
OFF
MY
TAIL
IN
HEAVY
TRAFFIC
I
SLOW
DOWN
A
BIT
MOSTLY
SO
I
HAVE
MORE
BUFFER
ZONE
IN
FRONT
TO
BALANCE
THE
MINIMAL
BUFFER
BEHIND
BUT
I
ALSO
OFTEN
FIND
THAT
THE
JERK
BEHIND
WILL
NOTICE
TRAFFIC
MOVING
FASTER
IN
OTHER
LANES
SWITCH
INTO
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
PASS
ME
WHICH
IS
FINE
BECAUSE
THEN
I
CAN
KEEP
A
BETTER
EYE
ON
THE
JERK
FROM
BEHIND
WHILE
LOOKING
AHEAD
RATHER
THAN
FROM
IN
FRONT
WHILE
SPLITTING
MY
ATTENTION
BETWEEN
AHEAD
AND
THE
MIRRORS
IN
TRAFFIC
SO
HEAVY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
FOR
THE
JERK
TO
PASS
I
MIGHT
PULL
OVER
AS
IF
TO
LOOK
FOR
A
STREET
NUMBER
OR
NAME
STILL
IGNORING
THE
JERK
JUST
TO
GET
THE
JERK
OFF
MY
TAIL
IF
THIS
ALL
SOUNDS
WELL
WIMPY
OR
UNDENIZENLY
OR
PESSIMISTIC
OR
PERHAPS
FOR
ANY
PSYCH
TYPES
PASSIVEAGGRESSIVE
CONSIDER
THAT
I
PREFER
TO
GET
MY
ADRENALINE
JOLLIES
FROM
RIDING
RATHER
THAN
FROM
YELLING
AT
JERKS
A
RIDE
CAN
IMPROVE
MY
WHOLE
DAY
WHILE
YELLING
AT
A
JERK
IS
LIKELY
FOR
ME
TO
RUIN
MY
RIDE
OR
MY
DAY
WITH
MY
OWN
ANGER
IN
THE
WORST
CASE
YELLING
AT
THE
JERK
COULD
RUIN
MY
LIFE
SINCE
EVEN
A
TINY
JERK
IN
A
CAGE
BEHIND
ME
IS
BETTER
ARMED
WITH
THE
CAGE
THAN
I
AM
ON
A
BIKE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
SUBTLY
ARRANGING
TO
BE
THE
LAST
VEHICLE
TO
LEGALLY
CROSS
ONE
OR
MORE
INTERSECTIONS
LEAVING
THE
JERK
WAITING
FOR
CROSS
TRAFFIC
AND
THUS
OFF
YOUR
TAIL
OR
CROSSING
ILLEGALLY
HOPEFULLY
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
WAITING
POLICE
LIKE
ALMOST
EVERYTHING
HERE
YOUR
CHOICES
AND
MILEAGE

VARY
