WRITES
I
WAS
POSTING
TO
ALTLOCKSMITHING
ABOUT
THE
BEST
METHODS
FOR
SECURING
A
MOTORCYCLE
I
GOT
SEVERAL
RESPONSES
REFERRING
TO
THE
COBRA
LOCK
DESCRIBED
BELOW
HAS
ANYONE
COME
ACROSS
A
STORE
CARRYING
THIS
LOCK
IN
THE
CHICAGO
AREA
IT
IS
AVAILABLE
THROUGH
SOME
DEALERSHIPS
WHO
IN
TURN
HAVE
TO
BACK
ORDER
IT
FROM
THE
MANUFACTURER
DIRECTLY
EACH
ONE
IS
MADE
TO
ORDER
AT
LEAST
IF
YOU
GET
A
NONSTANDARD
LENGTH
STANDARD
IS
I
BELIEVE
ANY
OTHER
FEEDBACK
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
USED
THIS

DAVID

WRITES
INCIDENTALLY
THE
BEST
LOCK
IVE
FOUND
FOR
BIKES
IS
THE
COBRA
LOCK
ITS
A
CABLE
WHICH
IS
SHROUDED
BY
AN
ARTICULATED
HARDENED
STEEL
SLEEVE
THE
LOCK
ITSELF
IS
CYLINDRICAL
AND
THE
LOCKING
PAWL
ENGAGES
THE
JOINTS
AT
THE
ARTICULATION
POINTS
SO
THE
CHAIN
CAN
BE
ADJUSTED
LIKE
HANDCUFFS
YOU
CANT
GET
ANY
LEVERAGE
ON
THE
LOCK
TO
BREAK
IT
OPEN
AND
THE
CYLINDER
IS
WELLPROTECTED
I
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
CUT
ONE
OF
THESE
WITHOUT
A
TORCH
ANDOR
A
VICE
AND
HEAVY
DUTY
CUTTING
WHEEL
I
HAVE
A
LONG
COBRALINKS
LOCK
THAT
I
USED
TO
USE
FOR
MY
HARLEY
SHE
DOESNT
GET
OUT
MUCH
ANYMORE
SO
I
DONT
USE
THE
LOCK
THAT
OFTEN
ANYMORE
IT
IS
MADE
OF
ARTICULATED
STEEL
SHELLS
COVERING
SEVEN
STRANDS
OF
STEEL
CABLE
IT
IS
PROBABLY
ENOUGH
TO
STOP
ALL
THE
JOYRIDERS
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
PROFESSIONALS
CAN
OPEN
IT
RATHER
EASILY
FREEZE
A
LINK
BREAK
FROZEN
LINK
WITH
YOUR
FAVORITE
METHOD
HAMMERS
WORK
WELL
SNIP
THROUGH
THE
STEEL
CABLES
WHICH
I
HAVE
ON
AUTHORITY
ARE
FRIGHTFULLY
THIN
WITH
A
SET
OF
BOLTCUTTERS
FOR
THE
SAME
MONEY
YOU
CAN
GET
A
KRYPTONITE
CABLE
LOCK
WHICH
IS
ANYWHERE
FROM
TO
THICK
STEEL
CABLE
LOOKS
LIKE
STEEL
ROPE
SHIELDED
IN
A
FLEXIBLE
COVERING
TO
PROTECT
YOUR
BIKES
FINISH
AND
HAS
A
BARRELTYPE
LOCKING
MECHANISM
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
ITS
ADJUSTABLE
BUT
MY
SOURCE
SAYS
ITS
MORE
DIFFICULT
TO
PICK
THAN
MOST
LOCKS
AND
THE
CABLE
TENDS
TO
SQUISH
FLAT
IN
BOLTCUTTER
JAWS
RATHER
THAN
SHEAR
MODEL
ALL
BETS
ARE
OFF
IF
THE
THIEF
HAS
A

WITH
A
CUTOFF
