check

local
blue
light
special
for

sale
on

why
are
rednecks
called
rednecks
the
origin
of
the
slang
is
probably
a
reference
to
a
sunburned
neck
often
obtained
while
performing
honest
work
outdoors
the
neck
is
specified
to
distinguish
these
people
whose
shirtprotected
chest
and
back
are
pale
from
the
elitist
wealthy
who
in
their
idiotic
quest
for
darker
skin
pigmentation
as
a
badge
of
leisure
time
overdo
it
and
get
fullbody
sunburns
more
like
those
who
use
their
backs
instead
of
their
minds
to
make
their
living
who
are
usually
ignorant
and
intolerant
of
anything
outside
of
their
group

level
