well
it
looks
like
im
fcked
for
insurance
i
had
a
dwi
in
and
for
the
beemer
as
a
rec
vehicle
itll
cost
me
almost
bucks
to
insureyear
now
what
do
i
do
sell
the
bike
and
the
car
and
start
taking
the
bus
that
way
you
can
keep
drinking

seems
to
be
where
your
priorities
lay

enough
of
us
on
this
list
have
lost
friends
because
of
driving
drunks
that
our
collective
