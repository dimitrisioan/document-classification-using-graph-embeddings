RE
BOOM
DOG
ATTACK
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
WHILE
DRIVING
A
CAGE
A
DOG
DARTED
OUT
AT
A
QUIET
INTERSECTION
RIGHT
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
BUT
THERE
WAS
ENOUGH
DISTANCE
BETWEEN
US
SO
I
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
SLOW
DOWN
HOWEVER
A
DOG
SUDDENLY
APPEARED
AND
COLLIDED
WITH
MY
RIGHT
FRONT
BUMPER
AND
THE
FORCE
OF
THE
IMPACT
WAS
ENOUGH
TO
KILL
THAT
SCOTTISH
TERRIER
APPARENTLY
IT
WAS
FOLLOWING
THE
DOG
HENCEFORTH
IF
A
DOG
DECIDES
TO
CROSS
THE
STREET
KEEP
AN
EYE
OUT
FOR
A
DOG
AS
MANY
DOGS
LIKE
TO
TRAVEL
IN
PAIRS
OR
PACKS
IVE
YET
TO
EXPERIENCE
A
DOG
CHASING
ME
ON
MY
BLACK
WHICH
HAS
A
PRETTY
LOUD
OEM
HORN
NOT
AS
GOOD
AS
FIAMMS
BUT
GOOD
ENUFF
BUT
THE
BIKE
IS
LARGE
AND
HEAVY
ENOUGH
TO
RUN
RIGHT
OVER
ONE
OF
THE
SMALLER
NIPPERS
WHILE
THE
LARGER
ONES
WOULD
HAVE
TROUBLE
GETTING
MY
LEG
BETWEEN
THE
SADDLEBAGS
AND
ENGINE
GUARDS
ID
DEF
FEEL
MORE
VULNERABLE
ON
MY
TRUMP
AS
THATD
BE
EASIER
LEG
CHEWING
TARGET
FOR
THOSE
MONGRELS
IF
THERES
A
PERSISTENT
DOG
RUNNING
AFTER
BIKERS
DESPITE
COMPLAINTS
TO
THE
OWNER
I
WOULDNT
BE
ADVERSE
TO
RUNNING
OVER
IT
WITH
MY
TRUCK
AS
A
DOGS
LIFE
ISNT
WORTH
MUCH
IMHO
COMPARED
TO
A
CHILD
RIDING
A
BIKE
WHO
GETS
KNOCKED
TO
THE
GROUND
BY
SAID
DOG
AND
DIES
FROM
A
HEAD
INJURY
ANY
DOG
IN
THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
THATS
VICIOUS
OR
A
PUBLIC
MENACE
RUNNING
ABOUT
UNLEASHED
IS
FAIR
GAME
AS
ROAD
KILL
