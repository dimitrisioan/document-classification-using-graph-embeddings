read
this
oh
boy
a
little
kbike
versus
scuffling
grow
up
and
that
goes
for
the
both
of
you
i
do
hope
that
the
dump
dempster
campaign
works
however
i
think
that
he
is
a
crook
and
i
am
suprised
that
it
has
taken
this
long
for
anything
to
be
done
though
obviously
it
aint
over
yet
on
the
other
hand
im
not
sure
that
i
want
to
be
in
bed
with
any
of
the
wackos
running
throwing
down
a
rathole
might
be
more
effective
than
sending
it
in
to
the
club
you
wouldnt
get
anything
but
you
dont
get
anything
now
the
magazine
you
say
ever
since
the
moa
politburo
installed
don
it
has
lacked
any
sort
of
panache
it
may
have
had
ah
but
what
would
i
know
i
own
a
and
a
kbike
