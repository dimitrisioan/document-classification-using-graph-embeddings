too
bad
it
didnt
notice
the
car
approaching
at
from
the
other
direction
i
got
a
closeup
view
of
the
our
poor
canine
friends
noggin
careening
off
the
front
bumper
smacking
the
asphalt
and
getting
runover
by
the
front
tire
it
managed
a
pretty
good
yelp
just
before
impact
peripheral
imminent
doom
i
guess
the
driver
didnt
see
me
or
they
probably
would
have
swerved
into
my
lane
the
squeegeed
pup
actually
got
up
and
headed
back
home
but
i
havent
seen
it
since
same
thing
to
me
everyday
the
same
dog
would
chase
my
bicycle
the
owners
thought
it
was
cute
even
after
i
got
the
moto
the
stupid
dog
would
do
the
same
thing
then
one
day
i
was
coming
home
in
the
opposite
lanethe
fluff
with
teeth
ran
to
get
me
and
played
momentum
sharing
with
a
dodge
pick
the
owners
tried
to
blame
me
for
driving
down
street
when
i
did
i
lived
in
a
wierd
