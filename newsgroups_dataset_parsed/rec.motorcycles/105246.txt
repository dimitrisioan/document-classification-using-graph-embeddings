WRITES
I
WAS
ENJOYING
LUNCH
THIS
SATURDAY
AT
FOODIES
IN
MILFORD
NH
WITH
AN
ASSORTMENT
OF
OTHER
NEDOD
FOLKS
WHEN
DEAN
COOKSON
YES
HE
HAS
NOT
LEFT
THE
COUNTRY
YET
MENTIONED
THAT
THE
WIRING
DIAGRAM
OF
THE
SHOWS
THAT
THE
LIGHT
SWITCH
IS
A
THREE
POSITION
SWITCH
HIGH
BEAM
LOW
BEAM
BOTH
BEAMS
WELL
THE
ACTUAL
ERGONOMICS
OF
THE
SWITCH
MAKE
IT
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
POSITION
SWITCH
BUT
SURE
ENOUGH
AS
DEAM
EXPECTED
WHEN
YOU
BALANCE
THE
TOGGLE
SWITCH
IN
THE
CENTER
POSITION
BOTH
THE
HIGH
AND
LOW
BEAMS
GO
ON
THIS
PROVIDES
A
VERY
NICE
LIGHT
COVERAGE
OF
THE
ROAD
THIS
IS
TRUE
FOR
THE
AND
THE
AND
I
WOULD
EXPECT
FOR
ANY
OTHER
LATE
MODEL
HONDA
WITH
THE
STANDARD
TWO
POSITION
LIGHT
SWITCH
ITS
A
MAKE
BEFORE
BREAK
TYPE
OF
SWITCH
IF
NOT
REQUIRED
IT
OUGHT
TO
BE
FOR
HIGHLOW
BEAMS
THERE
MIGHT
BE
A
WEE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
IF
YOU
USE
BOTH
FILAMENTS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THE
BULB
IS
TOSSING
OUT
A
GREAT
DEAL
MORE
HEAT
THAN
NORMAL
POSSIBLY
ENOUGH
TO
SHORTEN
ITS
LIFE
SPAN
MY
HONDA
CRX
CAGE
A
CAGE
THAT
REALLY
WANTED
TO
BE
A
BIKE
HAD
WIMPY
STOCK
LIGHTS
SO
WE
USED
TO
RUN
AROUND
WITH
BOTH
BEAMS
ON
MADE
A
MUCHO
BIG
DIFFERENCE
UNTIL
BOTH
LOW
BEAM
FILAMENTS
DIED
NEARLY
SIMULTANEOUSLY
THIS
WAS
TWO
WEEKS
AFTER
FINDING
OUT
HOW
NICE
IT
WAS
TO
USE
BOTH
BEAMS
I
REPLACED
THE
LIGHTS
WITH
QUARTZHALOGEN
LIGHTS
AND
THAT
ENDED
THE
PROBLEM
