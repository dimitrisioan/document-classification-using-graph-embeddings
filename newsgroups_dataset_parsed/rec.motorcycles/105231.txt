NEED
HELP
GETTING
MY
TO
BEHAVE
IVE
MANAGED
TO
GET
THE
FRONT
SUSPENSION
TO
BE
VERY
HAPPY
BUT
THE
REAR
SUCKS
I
CANT
DO
ANYTHING
WITH

IT
FEEL
OK
THE
BIKE

VERY
STABLE
THROUGH
THE
CORNERS
I
THINK
BECAUSE

WHEN
THE
STRAIGHTS
GET
BUMPY
THE
REAR
IS
TORTUROUS
IT
FEELS
LIKE
IT
ACTUALLY
AMPLIFIES
THE
BUMPS
AND
THE
DAMPING
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
DO
ANYTHING
IN
REALLIFE
ALTHOUGH
YOU
CAN
TELL
THE
DIFFERENCE
WHEN
THE
BIKE
ISNT
MOVING
IVE
TRIED
CM
OF
SAG
FROM
COMPLETELEY
UNLOADED
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHICH
WAY
TO
GO
HAS
ANYONE
GOTTEN
THE
REAR
OF
THIS
BIKE
COMFORTABLE
AND
IF
SO
WHAT
KIND
OF
SETTINGS
ESP
WHAT
SAG
DID
YOU
USE
I
LIKE
TO
CORNER
BUT
I
ALSO
WOULD
LIKE
MY
KIDNEYS
TO
REMAIN
INTACT
THIS
THING
MAKES
THE
NEW
FEEL
COMFY
