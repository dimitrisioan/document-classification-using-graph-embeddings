i
need
help
with
my
i
put
supertrapp
slipons
on
it
and
had
the
carbs
rejetted
to
match
a
set
of
kn
filters
that
replaced
the
stock
airbox
ahh
and
just
how
were
the
carbs
rejeted
to
match
the
changes
you
made
to
the
bike
a
stage
three
kit
from
kn
or
dynojet
now
i
have
a
huge
flat
spot
in
the
carburation
at
about
thousand
rpm
in
most
any
gear
isnt
rejetting
fun
this
is
especially
frustrating
on
the
highway
the
bike
likes
to
cruise
at
about
which
happens
to
be
rpm
in
sixth
gear
ive
had
it
tuned
and
this
doesnt
seem
to
help
i
am
thinking
about
new
carbs
or
the
injection
system
from
a
gpz
does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
for
a
fix
besides
restoring
it
to
stock
new
carbs
why
would
that
fix
it
you
still
have
to
get
the
jetting
right
to
match
what
seems
to
be
a
extremely
overly
lean
condition
you
added
a
more
free
flowing
exhaust
and
then
higher
flowing
filters
chances
are
its
to
lean
but
this
may
not
bethats
the
big
fun
with
carb
tuning
its
very
tricky
your
one
and
only
choice
unless
you
want
to
spend
many
hours
fiddling
with
the
carbs
is
to
take
it
to
a
guy
witha
dyno
and
have
he
tune
the
carbs
for
your
current
set
up
otherwise
youll
be
playing
a
guessing
game
for
a
long
time
