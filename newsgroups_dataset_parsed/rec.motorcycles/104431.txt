SUPERTRAPP

HAD
THE

HAVE
A
HUGE
FLAT
SPOT
IN
THE
CARBURATION
AT
ABOUT
THOUSAND
RPM
IN
MOST
ANY
GEAR
ISNT
REJETTING
FUN
THIS
IS
ESPECIALLY
FRUSTRATING
ON
THE
HIGHWAY
THE
BIKE
LIKES
TO
CRUISE
AT
ABOUT
WHICH
HAPPENS
TO
BE
RPM
IN
SIXTH
GEAR
IVE
HAD
IT
TUNED

DOESNT
SEEM

HELP
I
AM
THINKING
ABOUT
NEW

OR
THE
INJECTION
SYSTEM
FROM
A
GPZ
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
FOR
A
FIX
BESIDES
RESTORING

WHY

THAT
FIX
IT
YOU
STILL
HAVE
TO
GET

EXTREMELY
OVERLY
LEAN
CONDITION
YOU

EXHAUST

VERY
TRICKY
YOUR
ONE
AND
ONLY
CHOICE
UNLESS
YOU
WANT
TO
SPEND
MANY
HOURS
FIDDLING
WITH
THE
CARBS
IS
TO
TAKE
IT
TO
A
GUY
WITHA

HAVE
HE
TUNE
THE
CARBS
FOR
YOUR
CURRENT
