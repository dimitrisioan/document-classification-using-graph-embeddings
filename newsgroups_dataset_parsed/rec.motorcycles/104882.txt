my
problem
turned
out
to
be
a
screw
unscrewed
inside
my
mikuni
carb
i
keep
hearing
that
one
should
keep
all
of
the
screws
tight
on
a
bike
but
i
never
thought
that
i
had
to
do
that
on
the
screws
inside
of
a
carb
at
least
it
was
roadside
fixable
and
i
was
on
my
way
in
hardly
any
time
gee
i
always
figured
that
it
was
the
loose
screws
onin
the
rider
that
were
most
likely
to
cause
any
problems
did
you
check
for
that
at
the
same
time
that
is
very
true
however
screws
have
been
loose
on
this
rider
for
quite
some
time
so
they
had
been
taken
into
account
russian
roulette
is
fun
out
of
times
