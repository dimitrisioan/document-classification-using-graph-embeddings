FROM

HI
I
HAVE
AN
CUSTOM
THAT
I
JUST
REPLACED
THE
CYLINDER
HEAD
GASKET
ON
NOW
WHEN
I
PUT
IT
BACK
TOGETHER
AGAIN
IT
WOULDNT
IDLE
AT
ALL
IT
WAS
ONLY
RUNNING
ON
CYLINDERS
AND
IT
WOULD
BACKFIRE
AND
SPIT
FLAMES
OUT
THE
EXHAUST
ON
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
THE
EXHAUST
IS
MAC
I
BOUGHT
NEW
PLUGS
TODAY
AND
IT
RUNS
VERY
ROUGH
AND
STILL
WONT
IDLE
I
AM
QUITE
SURE
THE
FINE
TUNE
KNOBS
ON
THE
CARBS
ARE
MESSED
UP
I
CHECKED
THE
TIMING
IT
WAS
FINE
SO
I
ADVANCED
IT
A
LITTLE
AND
THAT
DIDNT
HELP
I
ASSUME
THE
CARBS
NEED
TO
BE
SYNCHED
CAN
I
BUY
A
KIT
AND
DO
THIS
MYSELF
IF
SO
WHAT
KIT
IS
THE
BEST
FOR
THE
PRICE
ANY
OTHER
SUGGESTIONS
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
THE
CARBS
THAT
ARE
OUT
I
WOULD
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
CAM
TIMING
IS
OUT
AS
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
HAD
THE
HEAD
OFF
THAT
WOULD
MAKE
SENSE
TO
ME
IAN
JUST
MY
EMUS
WORTH
IAN
DEELEY
WHATEVER
YOU
DO
WILL
BE
SCHOOL
OF
ENGINEERING
INSIGNIFICANT
BUT
ITS
VERY
UNIVERSITY
OF
SUSSEX
OOO
IMPORTANT
THAT
YOU
DO
IT
ENGLAND
ANON
