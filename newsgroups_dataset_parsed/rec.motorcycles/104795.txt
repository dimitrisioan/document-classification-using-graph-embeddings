RE
COUNTERSTEERING
TO
KNOW
OR
NOT
TO
KNOW
WHAT
IS
THE
QUESTION
JERRY
LOTTO
WRITES
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
RUNNING
THREAD
ON
THE
NEED
TO
UNDERSTAND
COUNTERSTEERING
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
LOT
OF
OPINION
BUT
NOT
MUCH
OF
IT
HAS
ANY
BASIS
IN
FACT
OR
STUDY
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
THE
UNDERSTANDING
AND
ABILITY
TO
SWERVE
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
ABSENT
AMONG
THE
ACCIDENTINVOLVED
RIDERS
IN
THE
HURT
STUDY
THE
AVERAGE
RIDER
DOES
NOT
IDENTIFY
THAT
COUNTERSTEERING
ALONE
PROVIDES
THE
PRIMARY
INPUT
TO
EFFECT
MOTORCYCLE
LEAN
BY
THEMSELVES
EVEN
AFTER
MANY
YEARS
OF
PRACTICE
I
WOULD
AGREE
ENTIRELY
WITH
THESE
THREE
PARAGRAPHS
BUT
DID
THE
HURT
STUDY
MAKE
ANY
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
AN
ABILITY
TO
SWERVE
AND
A
FAILURE
TO
SWERVE
IN
MOST
OF
THE
ACCIDENTS
AND
NEAR
ACCIDENTS
THAT
IVE
SEEN
RIDERS
WILL
ALMOST
ALWAYS
STAND
ON
THE
BRAKES
AS
HARD
AS
THEY
DARE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
THE
INSTINCT
TO
BRAKE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
DANGER
IS
SO
STRONG
THAT
IT
OVERRIDES
EVERYTHING
ELSE
HARD
BRAKING
AND
SWERVING
TEND
TO
BE
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
MANOUVRES
DID
HURT
DRAW
ANY
CONCLUSIONS
ON
WHICH
ONE
IS
GENERALLY
PREFERABLE
