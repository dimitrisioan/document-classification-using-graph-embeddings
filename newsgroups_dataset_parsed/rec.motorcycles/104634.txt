FOR

SEVERELY
HUMORIMPAIRED
THIS
PERSON
IS
LBS
AND
FAIRLY
SMALL
SO
I
DONT
SEE
WEIGHT
AS
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
PROBLEM
BUT
WHAT
SORT
OF
OF
ADVICE
SHOULD
I
GIVE
HER
BEFORE
WE

I
WANT
HER
TO
HOLD
ONTO
ME
RATHER
THAN

ACCELERATE
A
WEE
BIT
MORE
SLOWLY

CONSCIOUSLY
WORRY

ITS
AS

EACH
OTHERS
BODY
ENGLISH
SHE
NEEDS
TO
LEARN
WHAT
YOUR
IDEA
IS
ABOUT
HOW
TO
TAKE
THE
TURN
AND
YOU
NEED
TO
LEARN
HER
IDEA
OF
SHIT
DONT
CRASH
NOW
SO
YOU
DONT
WORK
AT
CROSS
PURPOSES
WHILE
LEANED
OVER
YOU
CAN
WORK
UP
TO
MORE
AGGRESSIVE
RIDING
OVER
TIME
A
VERY
IMPORTANT
THING
TELL
HER
TO
PUT
HER
HAND
AGAINST
THE
TANK
WHEN
YOU
BRAKETHIS
COULD
SAVE
