RE
AEROSTITCH
OR
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
REQUEST
FOR
OPINIONS
WHICH
IS
BETTER
A
ONEPIECE
AEROSTITCH
OR
A
TWOPIECE
AEROSTITCH
LIKE
MOST
EVERYONE
ELSE
I
ENDED
UP
GETTING
TWO
DIFFERENT
SIZES
FOR
THE
TOP
AND
BOTTOM
MY
TOP
IS
A
AND
THE
BOTTOM
IS
A
FOR
THE
BOTTOM
THE
WAIST
IS
FAR
TOO
LARGE
BUT
THE
THIGHS
FIT
JUST
RIGHT
THE
HAD
A
BETTER
WAIST
BUT
CUT
OFF
THE
CIRCULATION
IN
MY
LEGS
I
HAVE
LARGE
MUSCULAR
THIGHS
AND
NO
I
DIDNT
USE
THE
THIGHMASTER
TO
GET
THEM
THE
JACKET
FITS
ME
OK
IN
THE
CHEST
SLIGHTLY
SNUG
AT
THE
WAIST
AND
TOO
SMALL
IN
THE
ARMS
I
CANT
IMAGINE
FINDING
A
ONEPIECE
SIZE
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
FIT
CORRECTLY
AS
EVEN
THE
PIECE
HAS
ITS
PROBLEMS
STRANGE
SINCE
MY
VPILOT
JACKET
FITS
GREAT
ALL
OVER
AND
WHEN
I
TRIED
THE
MATCHING
PANTS
THEY
FIT
LIKE
A
GLOVE
AS
WELL
I
CAN
ONLY
ASSUME
THE
MODELS
AERO
DESIGN
USES
TO
DESIGN
ITS
SUITS
ARE
IN
SOME
WAY
DIFFERENT
FROM
US
REAL
FOLKS
ALSO
EVEN
THOUGH
ITS
RELATED
TO
CONVIENIENCE
YOU
LOOK
PRETTY
DAMN
WIERD
WALKING
AROUND
WITH
THE
TOPS
AND
BOTTOMS
WHILE
RUNNING
ERRANDS
IVE
GOTTEN
SOME
REALLY
SUSPICIOUS
LOOKS
AND
SWEATED
A
LOT
WHILE
IN
A
STORE
WEARING
THE
WHOLE
SUIT
SINCE
YOU
CANT
FIT
THE
TOP
AND
BOTTOM
IN
ANY
MOTORCYCLE
STORAGE
DEVICE
YET
DEVISED
EXCEPT
THE
TRUNK
IN
MY
SIDECAR
RIG
WITH
THE
TWO
PIECE
I
UNZIP
THE
PANTS
I
GENERALLY
LEAVE
THE
TWO
PIECES
ZIPPED
TOGETHER
PRIMARILY
BECAUSE
THE
PANTS
FALL
DOWN
UNLESS
I
PULL
THE
CHEESY
ELASTIC
BELTTYPE
BAND
REAL
TIGHT
STUFF
THEM
IN
ONE
OF
MY
SPACIOUS
BMW
SADDLEBAGS
THE
PANTS
JUST
FIT
AND
RUN
ERRANDS
JUST
WEARING
THE
JACKET
ACTUALLY
IF
I
KNOW
ILL
BE
RUNNING
ERRANDS
I
JUST
WEAR
MY
VPILOT
JACKET
BUT
THATS
JUST
ME
AS
FAR
AS
CRASH
PROTECTION
ID
SAY
THAT
BOTH
SUITS
ARE
PROBABLY
EQUAL
IT
SEEMS
THAT
FOR
WEATHER
PROTECTION
IF
ANYTHING
THE
PIECE
PROVIDES
A
LITTLE
MORE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
JACKET
OVERLAPPING
THE
PANTS
BY
INCHES
THE
PIECE
IS
PROBABLY
A
LITTLE
LESS
COMFORTABLE
AROUND
THE
WAIST
JUST
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EXTRA
LAYER
OF
STUFF
BUT
MAYBE
NOT
SO
ID
HAVE
TO
VOTE
FOR
THE
TWO
PIECE
DESPITE
THE
SLIGHTLY
ODD
FIT
I
STILL
FIND
THE
SUIT
THE
MOST
VERSATILE
PIECE
OF
RIDING
CLOTHING
I
OWN
WOULDNT
GO
LONG
DISTANCE
WITHOUT
IT
