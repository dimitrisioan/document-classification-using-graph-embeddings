re
a
kinder
gentler
bmw
mailing
list
sorry
had
to
take
out
txmotorcycles
because
my
news
server
rejected
it
hesh
bob
pasker
rbpnetcomcom
wrote
it
would
be
a
shame
to
split
boxer
riders
between
different
lists
unless
of
course
the
existing
list
failed
to
meet
the
readers
needs
you
presumed
you
needed
to
split
out
a
gs
list
by
implication
of
your
split
a
plain
ol
bmw
list
wouldnt
meet
the
gs
riders
needs
for
the
sake
of
not
forcing
the
split
issue
how
about
changing
the
charter
and
renaming
your
list
from
bmwgs
to
just
bmw
would
that
make
everybody
happy
i
think
youd
get
better
participation
this
way
and
joe
wouldnt
have
to
burden
his
hesh
