WRITES
ON
A
WATERSKI
BIKE
YOU
TURN
THE
HANDLEBARS
LEFT
TO
LEAN
RIGHT
JUST
LIKE
ON
A
MOTORCYCLE
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
AT
LEAST
NOT
ON
ALL
JETSKIS
ON
MY
FRIENDS
JETSKI
BARS
TURN
LEFT
TO
GO
LEFT
ANYWAY
ALL
YOURE
DOING
THERE
IS
CHANGING
THE
YAW
OF
THE
JETS
SO
THE
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE
HANDLBARS
AND
THE
REARMOUNTED
JETS
IS
COMPLETELY
ARBITRARY
SIMPLE
LINKAGE
COULD
MAKE
IT
WORK
EITHER
WAY
SO
THIS
SUPPORTS
THE
MOVETHECONTACTPATCHFROMBENEATHTHE
CENTREOFMASS
THEORY
ON
HOW
TO
LEAN
THIS
CONTRADICTS
THE
NEED
FOR
GYROSCOPIC
PRECESSION
TO
HAVE
A
COUNTERSTEERING
INDUCED
LEAN
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
JETSKIS
ARE
EVEN
MORE
IRRELEVANT
TO
THIS
DISCUSSION
THAN
SNOW
SKIS
BUT
IT
HAS
BEEN
AN
AMUSING
DIGRESSION
HEY
ED
HOW
DO
YOU
EXPLAIN
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
PULL
ON
A
HORSES
REINS
LEFT
TO

LEFT
