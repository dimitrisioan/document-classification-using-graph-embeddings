is
truly
the
miracle
spooge
my
chain
is
lubed
my
wheel
is
clean
after
id
try
it
on
the
vfr
but
goddamn
competition
accessories
hasnt
mailed
my
order
yet
hell
its
only
been
two
weeks
and
i
was
ordering
some
pretty
bizzare
stuff
like
a
clear
face
sheild
and
a
can
of
chain
wax
bastards
for
what
its
worth
i
got
my
can
in
three
days
from
chaparral
thats
ups
ground
from
ca
to
ut
ymmv
the
stuff
seems
to
work
and
it
doesnt
attract
grundge
like
blue
does
i
gave
it
the
acid
test
a
full
days
worth
of
breaking
in
the
quadracers
new
paddle
tires
down
at
the
sand
dunes
if
theres
anything
wet
stickey
it
will
be
coated
with
sand
at
the
end
of
the
day
but
the
chain
looked
pretty
clean
ill
third
the
recommendation
as
miracle
spooge
dont
go
to
the
dealer
to
get
it
or
what
happened
to
me
might
happen
to
you

a
deposit
on
