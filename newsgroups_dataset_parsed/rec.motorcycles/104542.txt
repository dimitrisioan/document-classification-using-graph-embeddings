IS
NOT
ABOUT
THE
LA
OR
NY
TIMES
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
A
SCREW
UNSCREWED
INSIDE
MY
MIKUNI
CARB
I
KEEP
HEARING
THAT
ONE
SHOULD
KEEP
ALL
OF
THE
SCREWS
TIGHT
ON
A
BIKE
BUT
I
NEVER
THOUGHT
THAT
I
HAD
TO
DO
THAT
ON
THE
SCREWS
INSIDE
OF
A
CARB
AT
LEAST
IT
WAS
ROADSIDE
FIXABLE
AND
I
WAS
ON
MY
WAY
IN
HARDLY
ANY
TIME
YOU
BETTER
CHECK
ALL
THE
SCREWS
IN
THAT
CARB
BEFORE
YOU
SUCK
ONE
INTO
A
JUG
AND
MUNGE
A
PISTON
OR
