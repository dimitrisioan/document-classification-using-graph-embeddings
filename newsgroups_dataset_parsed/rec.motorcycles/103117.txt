I
HATE
TO
ADMIT
THIS
AND
IM
STILL
MENTALLY
KICKING
MYSELF
FOR
IT
I
RODE
THE
BRAND
NEW
HOME
LAST
FRIDAY
NIGHT
MILES
IN
RAIN
AND
DARKNESS
NO
PROBLEMS
GOT
IT
HOME
AND
PUT
IT
ON
THE
CENTER
STAND
THE
NEXT
DAY
I
PUSHED
IT
OFF
THE
CENTER
STAND
IN
PREPARATION
FOR
GOING
OVER
TO
A
FRIENDS
HOUSE
TO
POSE
YOU
GUESSED
IT
IT
GOT
AWAY
FROM
ME
AND
LANDED
ON
ITS
RIGHT
SIDE
SCRATCHED
THE
LOWER
FAIRING
CRACKED
THE
RIGHT
MIRROR
AND
CRACKED
THE
UPPER
FAIRING
DAMN
AM
I
STUPID
ITS
GOING
TO
COST
ME
TO
GET
THE
LOCAL
BODY
SHOP
TO
FIX
IT
AND
THAT
IS
AFTER
I
TAKE
THE
FAIRING
OFF
FOR
THEM
STILL
THATS
PROBABLY
CHEAPER
THAN
THE
MIRROR
ALONE
IF
I
BOUGHT
A
REPLACEMENT
FROM
BMW
YOU
GOT
OFF
CHEAP
MY
SISTERS
EXBOYFRIEND
WAS
SUCH
AN
INCESSANT
PAIN
IN
THE
ASS
ABOUT
WANTING
TO
RIDE
MY
BIKES
NO
WAY
JOSE
THAT
I
FINALLY
TOOK
HIM
TO
LINDNERS
BMW
IN
NEW
CANAAN
CT
LAST
FALL
WHERE
I
HAD
SEEN
A
NICE
USED
IN
PERFECT
CONDITION
AFTER
TELLING
EVERYONE
IN
THE
SHOP
HIS
NORTON
WAR
STORIES
FROM
FIFTEEN
YEARS
AGO
SIGNING
THE
LIABILITY
WAIVER
AND
GETTING
HIS
PREFLIGHT
OFF
HE
WENT
WELL
NOT
QUITE
I
WALKED
OUT
OF
A
PIZZA
SHOP
UP
THE
STREET
FEELING
GOOD
ABOUT
MYSELF
MADE
MY
SISTERS
BOYFRIEND
HAPPY
AND
GOT
THE
PERSISTENT
WANKER
OFF
MY
ASS
FOR
GOOD
HEARD
THE
HORRENDOUS
RACKET
OF
AN
ENGINE
TORTURED
TO
ITS
RED
LINE
AND
THEN
A
CRASH
I
SAW
PEOPLE
RUNNING
TOWARDS
THE
OBVIOUS
SOURCE
OF
THE
DISTURBANCE
JEFF
LAYING
UNDER
THE
BMW
WITH
THE
REAR
WHEEL
SPINNING
WILDLY
AND
SOMEONE
GROPING
FOR
THE
KILL
SWITCH
I
STARED
IN
DISBELIEF
WITH
A
SLICE
HANGING
OUT
OF
MY
MOUTH
AS
MATTY
THE
SHOP
MANAGER
SLID
UP
BESIDE
ME
AND
ASKED
FRIEND
OF
YOURS
STEVE
SHIT
MATTY
IT
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
WORSE
THAT
COULD
BEEN
MY
FLHS
JEFF
HADNT
MADE
IT
INCHES
WITNESSES
SAID
HE
LIFTED
HIS
FEET
BEFORE
LETTING
OUT
THE
CLUTCH
AND
GRAVITY
GOT
THE
BEST
OF
HIM
JEFF
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
CLUTCH
DIDNT
ENGAGE
MATTY
WAS
QUICK
WHILE
JEFF
WAS
STILL
STUTTERING
IN
EMBARRASSED
SHOCK
HE
MANAGED
TO
SNATCH
JEFFS
CREDIT
CARD
FOR
A
QUICK
IMPRINT
AND
SIGNATURE
TWENTY
MINUTES
LATER
WHEN
JEFFS
COLOR
HAD
PALED
TO
A
FLUSH
MATTY
PRESENTED
HIM
WITH
AN
ESTIMATE
OF
FOR
A
BUSTED
RIGHT
MIRROR
AND
A
HAIRLINE
CRACK
IN
THE
FAIRING
THAT
WAS
FOR
FIXING
THE
CRACK
AND
MASKING
THE
DAMAGED
AREA
NOT
A
NEW
FAIRING
OR
HE
COULD
BUY
THE
BIKE
IM
NOT
SURE
WHAT
HAPPENED
LATER
AS
MY
SISTER
SPLIT
UP
WITH
JEFF
SHORTLY
AFTERWARDS
TO
HOOK
UP
WITH
ANOTHER
PIECE
OF
WORK
EXCEPT
THAT
MATTY
TOLD
ME

CHARGE
THROUGH
IN
DECEMBER
AND
THAT
