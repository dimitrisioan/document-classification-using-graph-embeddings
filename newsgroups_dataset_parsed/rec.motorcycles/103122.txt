how
do
the
helmetless
do
it
um
the
same
way
people
do
it
on
horseback
not
as
fast
and
they
would
probably
enjoy
eating
bugs
anyway
every
bit
as
fast
as
a
dirtbike
in
the
right
terrain
and
we
eat
flies
thank
you
jeeps
youre
supposed
to
keep
the
windscreen
up
then
why
does
it
go
down
snow
skis
no
bugs
and
most
poeple
who
go
fast
wear
goggles
so
do
most
helmetless
motorcyclists
the
question
still
stands
how
do
cruiser
riders
with
no
or
negligible
helmets
stand
being
on
the
highway
at
mph
on
buggy
summer
evenings
helmetless
goggleless

night

picture
of

i
said
dod
go
on
get
to
know
her

grateful
dead

seemed
like
the
least
i
could
do
