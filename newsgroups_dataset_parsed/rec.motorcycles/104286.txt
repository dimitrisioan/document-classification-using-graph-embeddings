of
a
rider
giving
a
big
dog
such
as
a
great
dane
a
ride
on
the
back
of
his
bike

work
post
of
the
month
actually
ive
seen
riders
carting
around
a
pet
dog
in
a
sidecar
a
great
dane
on
the
back
though
sounds
a
bit
hairy
to
me
yeah
im
sure
that
our
lab
would
love
a
ride
hes
the
type
that
sticks
his
head
out
car
windows

i
didnt
think
that
he
would
enjoy
being
bungee
corded
to
the
gas
tank
and
lbs
