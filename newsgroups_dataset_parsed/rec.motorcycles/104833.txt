WHAT
A
DOG
WEIGHS
MAYBE
AT
MAX
YOU
CANT
HANDLE
IT
YOU
HAVE
I
PRESUME
THUMBS
GRAPPLE
WITH
IT
AND
TEAR
ITS
HEAD
OFF
SHEESH
EVEN
A
TRAINED
ATTACK
DOG
IS
NO
MATCH
FOR
A
HUMAN
WE
HAVE
ALL
THE
ADVANTAGES
THIS
WAS
A
RECENT
DISCUSSION
ON
RECMARTIALARTS
HUMANS
DEFINITELY
DONT
HAVE
ALL
THE
ADVANTAGES
DOGS
ARE
DECEPTIVELY
STRONG
AND
OFTEN
BRED
FOR
FIGHTING
OF
ONE
SORT
OR
ANOTHER
ED
DOD
BEING
RELATED
TO
FORMER
TRAINERS
I
HAVE
COME
TO
KNOW
THAT
HUMANS
DO
HAVE
ALL
THE
ADVANTAGES
WELL
AT
LEAST
ONE
ANYWAY
IT
IS
A
LITTLE
KNOWN
FACT
THAT
A
DOG
WILL
INVOLUNTARILY
REGURGITATE
AND
RELEASE
AN
OBJECT
THAT
IS
TOO
LARGE
TO
SWALLOW
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IF
I
WERE
EVER
ATTACKED
BY
A
DOG
I
SHOULD
BALL
MY
HAND
IN
A
FIST
AND
FORCE
IT
DOWN
THE
DOGS
THROAT
THE
DOG
WOULD
NATURALLY
GAG
AND
RELEASE
AND
BECOME
MOMENTARILY
DISORIENTED
THIS
COMMONLY
HAPPENS
TO
HUMANS
WHEN
WE
GO
TO
A
DOCTOR
AND
HAVE
OUR
THROATS
EXAMINED
PROOF
POSITIVE
IN
THE
TIME
DURING
THE
DOGS
DISORIENTATION
THE
NEXT
MOVE
WOULD
BE
TO
WRAP
AN
ARM
ABOUT
THE
DOG
THROAT
IN
A
CHOKE
HOLD
MANNER
AND
CONSTRICT
WITH
ALL
YOUR
MIGHT
UNTIL
THE
DOG
LAPSES
INTO
UNCONSCIOUSNESS
FROM
LACK
OF
OXYGEN
AND
HALTING
BLOOD
FLOW
FINALLY
RUN
LIKE
THE
WIND
TO
GET
AWAY
FROM
THE
LOCAL
AREA
SHOULD
THE
DOG
GET
UP
AGAIN
AND
BE
REALLY
PISSED
OOOOOOOPSSSSS
