THE
DIFFERENCE
OF
OPINION
AND
DIFFERENCE
IN
MOTORCYCLING
BETWEEN
THE
SPORTBIKE
RIDERS
AND
THE
CRUISERBIKE
RIDERS
THAT
DIFFERENCE
IS
ONLY
IN
THE
MINDS
OF
CERTAIN
CLOSEDMINDED
INDIVIDUALS
I
HAVE
HAD
THE
VERY
BEST
MOTORCYCLING
TIMES
WITH
RIDERS
OF
CRUISER
BIKES
HI
DON
EDDIE
YET
I
RIDE
ANYTHING
BUT
CONTINUOUSLY
ON
THIS
FORUM
AND
ON
THE
STREET
YOU
FIND
QUITE
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
OPINIONS
OF
WHAT
MOTORCYCLING
IS
TO
DIFFERENT
INDIVIDUALS
CRUISERBIKE
RIDERS
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
VIEW
OF
MOTORCYCLING
THAN
THOSE
OF
SPORT
BIKE
RIDERS
WHAT
THEY
LIKE
AND
DISLIKE
ABOUT
MOTORCYCLING
THIS
IS
NOT
CLOSEDMINDED
TO
NOT
RECOGNIZE
THIS
IS
IN
EFFECT
CLOSEMINDED
A
LOT
OF
IT
REMINDED
ME
OF

IF

IT
I
SCAN
IT
FOR
INFORMATION
A
LOT
OF
IT

NOISE
AND
POINTLESS
FLAMEAGE
ITS
WHY
