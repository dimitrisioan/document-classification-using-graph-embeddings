re
need
advice
for
riding
with
someone
on
pillion
because
riding
a
passenger
doesnt
really
depend
on
the
type
of
bike
the
things
you
want
a
passenger
to
donot
do
is
the
same
ergo
if
hes
asking
advice
i
reasoned
he
doesnt
have
much
practice
period
if
you
say
he
does
fine
i
still
wouldnt
take
the
uninitiated
up
a
road
thats
all
switch
backs
and
reversecenteruncrowned
roadway
not
to
mention
the
bdcs
and
squids
who
will
also
be
on
that
particular
road
he
asked
for
advice
and
even
though
it
wasnt
what
he
meant
i
still
consider
it
some
of
the
best
ive
read
lee
