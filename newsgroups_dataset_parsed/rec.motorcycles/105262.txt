ALSO
REMEMBER
THAT
ITS
MUCH
MORE
DRAINING
AND
TIRING
TO
RIDE
THAN
BY
YOURSELF
BECAUSE
YOURE
CONCENTRATING

MUCH

REMEMBER
THIS
THE
FIRST
FEW
TIMES
I
PILLIONED
SOMEONE
WHOSE
SAFETY
WAS
A
GREAT
CONCERN
TO
ME
AS
OPPOSED
TO
BROTHERS
ETC
I
ALMOST
GOT
US
BOTH
KILLED
ON
SEVERAL
OCCASIONS
I
WAS
SURPRISED
TO
DISCOVER
THAT
IT
IS
MUCH
SAFER
TO
JUST
DRIVE
THAN
TO
DISTRACT
YOURSELF
BY
TRYING

JUST
ASKING
