notice

kid
wave
more
than
other
bikers
the
reactions
of
little
boys
seems
to
be
the
most
enthusiastic
to
a
wave
and
also
good
to
see
i
always
wave
when
i
see
a
kid
that
has
at
least
noticed
my
bike
i
figure
it
helps
the
future
of
the
sport
dont
forget
little
girls
my
year
old
daughter
now
excitedly
points
and
says
motorcycle
every
time
she
sees
one
go
past
ive
done
my
work
of
course
it

a
chaffeured

rig
i
have
to
admit
that
i
usually
try
to
do
so
without
the
parental
figure
noticing
im
afraid
that
the
kid
will
get
yelled
at
for
associatign
with
antisocietal
types
like
us
can
you
think
of
a
better
way
to
convince
the
kid
that
someday
ill
ride
one
of
those
things
is
it
a
genetic
thing
with
little
boys
or
what
even
three
and
four
year
old
boys
seem
magnetically
attracted
to
motorcycles
of
virtaully
any
sort
often
to
the
dismay
of
thier
mothers
no
its
a
genetic
thing
with
little
humans
just
dont
let
them
touch
hot
pipes
