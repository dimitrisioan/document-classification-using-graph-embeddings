re
krypto
cables
was
re
cobra
locks
hi
im
not
sure
what
the
other
guy
cant
track
down
his
post
for
his
name
was
talking
about
when
he
made
the
claim
that
cobralinks
are
not
adjustable
they
are
theres
a
space
between
each
link
where
the
teeth
of
the
locking
head
notch
in
thus
each
link
is
a
possible
locking
point
also
and
this
is
not
applicable
to
hardcore
thieves
who
cart
around
liquid
nitrogen
and
oxyacetylene
torches
the
cobralinks
look
a
lot
more
effective
than
kryptonite
cable
locks
imho
and
i
think
the
initial
appearance
effect
is
more
relevant
to
boredjoyridersnominallyadeptat
crackingunsecuredbike
deterrence
as
long
as
the
lock
is
nominally
functional
finally
i
notice
that
when
i
ride
with
my
leathers
harness
boots
and
the
cobralinks
slung
across
like
a
bandolier
btw
ive
crashed
in
the
rain
dressed
like
this
and
the
lock
didnt
pulverize
any
vertebrae
cagers
give
me
a
much
wider
berth
dont
hassle
me
and
tend
to
avoid
any
potentially
inflammatory
action
at
stoplights
i
love
my
cobralinks
almost
as
much
as
i
love
my
honda
dinosaur
i
think
i
have
a
pavlovian
drool
reflexi
put
the
lock
on
ie
on
my
body
and
i
can
feel
the
bike
already
shaking
away
my
first
post
what
did
i
do
wrong
sang
dod
ps
any
other
owners
out
there
please
email
me
got
questions
about
the
weird
handling
on
my
bike
the
opinions
expressed
are
not
necessarily
