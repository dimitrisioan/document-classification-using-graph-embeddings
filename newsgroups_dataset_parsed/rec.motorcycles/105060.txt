ASSORTED
RANTING
GRR
HATE
THE
BASTARD
WHO
PICKED
THE
WEATHER
FOR
TODAY
WENT
UP
TO
VISIT
A
FRIEND
OVERNIGHT
ABOUT
MINUTE
RIDE
RODE
UP
AFTER
WORK
ONLY
MINOR
DRIZZING
FOR
THE
LAST
MINUTES
OF
THE
RIDE
REST
OF
THE
RIDE
WAS
VERY
ZEN
GOT
UP
THIS
MORNING
NEEDED
TO
GO
HOME
AND
GET
SOME
DISKS
STUFF
TO
WORK
ON
HER
COMPUTERS
WITH
RAINY
AS
ALL
HELL
SOAKED
AND
COLD
BY
THE
TIME
I
GOT
HOME
SINCE
I
DIDNT
HAVE
ANOTHER
SET
OF
THERMALS
WHICH
WERE
DRY
I
SAID
TO
HECK
WITH
IT
AND
DROVE
MY
CAGE
BACK
UP
LO
AND
BEHOLD
THOSE
FUNNY
BLUE
CLOUDS
WERE
UP
IN
THE
SKY
AND
THIS
WARM
YELLOW
THING
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IN
QUITE
AWHILE
SHOWED
UP
WHEN
I
WAS
MINUTES
INTO
THE
TRIP
AND
ME
IN
MY
CAGE
OH
JOY
HAPPILY
MY
RIGHT
HAND
MIRROR
FINALLY
SHOWED
UP
AT
THE
DEALER
DROPPED
THE
BIKE
WHEN
I
FIRST
GOT
IT
PUT
ON
AN
EMGO
REPLACEMENT
MIRROR
HATED
IT
THE
ENTIRE
TIME
THAT
THING
WAS
ON
MY
BIKE
BECAUSE
I
COULDNT
SEE
A
DAMNED
THING
THROUGH
IT
PLUS
ITS
FLAT
INSTEAD
OF
CONVEX
LIKE
THE
STOCK
MIRRORS
SO
YOU
GET
A
NARROW
ANGLE
WOBBLY
BLUR
AND
I
GOT
A
REPLACEMENT
WINDSHIELD
FOR
MY
FAIRING
DROPPED
THE
ORIGINAL
AND
CHIPPED
THE
FRONT
EDGE
COSMETIC
BUT
ANNOYING
SO
I
SPENT
HALF
AN
HOUR
HAPPILY
UNSCREWING
THINGS
AND
REPLACING
THEM
THIS
AFTERNOON
BOUT
THE
ONLY
THING
I
STILL
HATE
ABOUT
THE
BIKE
IS
THE
DAMNED
DCELL
FLASHLIGHT
HEADLIGHT
HAS
ANYONE
SEEN
A
GOOD
SOURCE
FOR
WATT
HALOGEN
PASSING
LIGHTS
SINCE
THE
CHARGING
SYSTEM
ON
THE
CANT
HANDLE
CONTINUOUS
USE
OF
A
HALOGEN
HEADLIGHT
I
WAS
THINKING
ABOUT
PUTTING
A
COUPLE
PASSING
LIGHTS
ON
THAT
WOULD
GIVE
ME
OF
LIGHTING
FOR
THE
RARE
NIGHT
RIDING
I
DO
BUT
WOULDNT
DRAIN
THE
BATTERY
DURING
NORMAL
USE
CHIEFLY
DAY
TRIPS
AND
COMMUTING
TO
WORK
AND
BACK
