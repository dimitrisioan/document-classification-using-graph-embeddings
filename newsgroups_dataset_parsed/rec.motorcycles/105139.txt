BACK
BREAKER
NEAR
HIT
WRITES
HEAR
SCREECHING
TIRES
I
DART
MY
EYES
TO
MY
MIRRORS
AND
REALIZE
ITS
THE
MOROON
FLYING
UP
RIGHT
BEHIND
ME
IN
MY
PANIC
I
POP
MY
CLUTCH
AND
STALL
THE
BIKE
LUCKILY
THE
GUY
STOPS
A
FOOT
BEHIND
MY
REAR
WHEEL
I
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
THEORETICALLY
STOP
SO
FAR
BEHIND
A
CAR
BUT
CAN
YOU
REALLY
IN
ACTUALITY
AVOID
SUCH
AN
INCIDENT
SUGGESTIONS
THE
EXPERIENCE
YOU
DESCRIBE
IS
WHY
I
DONT
LIKE
TO
SIT
WITH
MY
BIKE
IN
GEAR
I
FIGURE
THERES
A
CHANCE
THAT
ILL
BE
STARTLED
IN
SOME
WAY
AND
STALL
MY
BIKE
AND
I
FIGURE
THIS
IS
MORE
LIKELY
THAN
THE
CHANCE
THAT
ILL
BE
UNABLE
TO
ESCAPE
SOME
SITUATION
BECAUSE
OF
THE
EXTRA
TIME
NEEDED
TO
PUT
THE
BIKE
IN
GEAR
SO
I
CONCENTRATE
ON
AVOIDING
SITUATIONS
RATHER
THAN
MAKING
SPLITSECOND
EVASIVE
MANUVERS
I
SPLIT
LANES
SO
IM
NOT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
LINE
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
IS
NOT
LEGAL
IN
MOST
OF
THE
COUNTRY
IF
I
CANT
SPLIT
PERHAPS
THERE
ISNT
ROOM
THEN
I
WILL
STOP
NEAR
ONE
SIDE
OF
THE
LANE
SO
I
HAVE
AN
EASY
ESCAPE
AND
LEAVE
MY
BIKE
IN
GEAR
UNTIL
THE
NEXT
CAR
HAS
STOPPED
I
WATCH
IN
MY
MIRRORS
IN
THE
MEAN
TIME
TO
MAKE
SURE
IT
WILL
WHETHER
I
REALLY
WOULD
HAVE
TIME
TO
MOVE
SHOULD
A
CAR
FAIL
TO
STOP
I
HAVENT
HAD
TO
FIND
OUT
YET
SOME
CARS
HAVE
AN
ANNOYING
HABBIT
OF
RACING
UP
BEHIND
YOU
BEFORE
BRAKING
HEAVILLY
SO
IT
CAN
BE
HARD
TO
TELL
IF
THEY
ARE
PLANNING
TO
BRAKE
OR
NOT
SO
IN
SUMMARY
POSITION
YOURSELF
FOR
AN
EASY
EXIT
AND
THEN
WATCH
YOUR
MIRRORS
UNTIL
ITS
ALL
CLEAR
