WRITES
GET
THE
ORGANIZATION
TO
ACT
ON
IT
IS
EASY
TO
SAY
BUT
SAYS
LITTLE
ABOUT
WHAT
ONE
REALLY
CAN
AND
SHOULD
DO
WHAT
THE
ORGANIZATION
ACTUALLY
WILL
DO
IS
LARGELY
DETERMINED
BY
THE
PRESIDENT
AND
DIRECTORS
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
SEE
THATS
WHAT
MAKES
IT
SO
IMPORTANT
TO
VOTE
IN
AN
ELECTION
OF
OFFICERS
IF
I
REMEMBER
RIGHT
I
HEARD
THAT
IN
THE
LAST
ELECTION
ONLY
OF
THE
MEMBERS
ACTUALLY
CAST
VOTES
I
WONDER
IF
THE
CURRENT
BOARD
AND
THEIR
FRIENDS
AND
RELATIVES
MAKE
UP
OF
THE
MEMBERSHIP
I
CERTAINLY
PLAN
ON
STAYING
WITH
THE
CLUB
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
VOTE
AND
TO
SEE
THE
RESULTS
IT
DOES
STRIKE
ME
THAT
THE
BMWMOA
IS
A
LOT
LESS
POLITICALLY
ACTIVE
IN
THE
STATE
AND
NATIONAL
ARENAS
NOT
INFIGHTING
THAN
OTHER
MC
ORGANIZATIONS
SHOULD
WE
CHANGE
THIS
OR
JUST
JOIN
THE
OTHER
GROUPS
THAT
ALREADY
ARE
IN
POLITICS
I
WOULDNT
SUPPORT
THE
MOA
BECOMING
POLITICALLY
ACTIVE
IN
THAT
SENSE
THE
AMA
ALREADY
KNOWS
HOW
TO
DO
THAT
AND
ID
RATHER
SEE
THE
MOA
SUPPORT
THE
AMA
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
THE
AMA
NEEDS
I
THINK
THAT
MORE
COULD
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
FROM
ONE
STRONG
FRONT
RATHER
THAN
TWO
NOT
NECCESSARILY
COORDINATED
