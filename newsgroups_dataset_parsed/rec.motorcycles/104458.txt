WHAT
WORRIES
ME
ABOUT
THE
ACCIDENT
IS
THIS
I
DONT
THINK
I
COULD
HAVE
PREVENTED
IT
EXCEPT
BY
TRAVELING
MUCH
SLOWER
THAN
I
WAS
THIS
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
AN
UNREASONABLE
SUGGESTION
FOR
A
RESIDENTIAL

BUT
I
WAS
RIDING
AROUND
THE

LIMIT
YOU
CAN
FORGET
THIS
LINE
OF
REASONING
WHEN
AN
ANIMAL
DECIDES
TO
TAKE
YOU
THERES
NOTHING
YOU
CAN
DO
ABOUT
IT
IT
HAS
SOMETHING

WITH
THEIR
GENETICS

BUT
A
GOOD
FORTY

CHASED
ME
DOWN
AND
NAILED
ME
NO

A
