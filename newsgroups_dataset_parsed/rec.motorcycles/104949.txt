waved
at

ive
never

done
it
oh
yeah
all
the
time
on
a
nice
springsummer
day
i
roll
down
the
window
and
drive
around
looking
for
bikes
when
a
bike
motors
by
in
the
opposite
direction
i
stick
my
arm
out
and
my
arm
feels
like
a
million
bucks
when
im
doing
this
a
i
do
the
same
thing
with
cyclists
the
only
problem
with
a
cyclist
is
their
always
in
the
right
hand
lane
i
hafta
roll
down
the
other
window
and
them

the
back

the
thought
