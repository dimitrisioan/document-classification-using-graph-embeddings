dogs
im
a
biker
and
a
doglover
first
and
foremost
i
want
to
mention
some
common
sense
if
its
a
choice
between
injuringkilling
a
dog
or
getting
yourself
injuredkilled
there
is
only
one
rational
decision
only
the
most
insane
animal
rights
kook
would
put
the
dog
first
second
its
useful
to
learn
how
to
read
a
dogs
body
language
how
you
react
to
a
dog
who
is
chasing
you
because
he
thinks
its
a
game
and
that
youre
playing
with
him
is
completely
different
from
how
you
react
to
a
dog
which
has
hostile
intent
third
its
useful
to
learn
how
to
present
yourself
to
a
dog
dogs
are
social
beasts
and
recognize
a
dominationsubmission
hierarchy
to
a
dog
there
are
two
types
of
fellowcreatures
that
which
he
dominates
and
that
which
dominate
him
you
need
to
unambiguously
represent
yourself
as
being
of
the
latter
class
you
are
god
you
are
easily
angered
and
your
anger
is
terrible
but
god
is
also
amused
by
one
who
properly
submits
to
his
dominance
and
may
even
on
rare
occasions
dispense
a
kind
word
a
kind
word
or
even
oh
joy
oh
rapture
unforeseen
a
dog
bisquit
now
how
does
that
all
relate
to
biking
well
first
its
a
good
idea
to
assume
that
most
dogs
who
chase
motorcycles
do
so
because
they
think
its
a
game
and
not
out
of
overt
hostility
the
msf
suggestion
is
a
very
good
one
when
you
see
the
dog
coming
slow
down
so
he
determines
a
particular
place
of
interception
just
before
you
and
he
reach
that
spot
punch
the
throttle
so
that
when
he
reaches
it
youre
already
long
gone
dogs
take
a
few
seconds
to
react
to
new
input
and
definitely
cannot
comprehend
the
acceleration
that
a
motorcycle
is
capable
of
with
a
hostile
dog
or
one
which
you
repeatedly
encounter
stronger
measures
may
be
necessary
this
is
the
face
off
first
and
there
is
very
important
make
sure
you
never
face
off
a
dog
on
his
territory
face
him
off
on
the
road
not
on
his
driveway
if
necessary
have
a
large
stick
rolled
up
newspaper
etc
something
the
beast
will
understand
is
something
that
will
hurt
him
stand
your
ground
then
slowly
advance
your
mental
attitude
is
that
you
are
very
angry
and
are
going
to
dispense
terrible
punishment
the
larger
the
dog
the
greater
your
anger
dogs
will
pick
up
anger
just
as
they
can
pick
up
fear
and
since
you
and
he
are
not
on
his
home
territory
it
may
suddenly
dawn
on
the
dog
that
perhaps
he
is
on
your
territory
and
that
you
are
prepared
to
fight
to
the
death
most
dogs
will
decide
that
it
is
a
good
idea
to
retreat
to
their
own
territory
where
there
is
at
least
a
home
advantage
theyll
also
observe
that
you
are
satisfied
by
that
retreat
gesture
of
submission
and
thus
they
have
escaped
punishment
the
interesting
thing
about
dogs
is
that
body
language
communicates
a
great
deal
to
them
the
more
effective
you
are
at
communicating
body
language
the
less
you
actually
have
to
do
after
years
with
my
pound
beast
ive
learned
a
few
tricks
i
think
