incidentally
the
best
lock
ive
found
for
bikes
is
the
cobra
lock
its
a
cable
which
is
shrouded
by
an
articulated
hardened
steel
sleeve
the
lock
itself
is
cylindrical
and
the
locking
pawl
engages
the
joints
at
the
articulation
points
so
the
chain
can
be
adjusted
like
handcuffs
you
cant
get
any
leverage
on
the
lock
to
break
it
open
and
the
cylinder
is
wellprotected
i
wouldnt
want
to
cut
one
of
these
without
a
torch
andor
a
vice
and
heavy
duty
cutting
wheel
