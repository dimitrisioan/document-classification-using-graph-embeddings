i
need
some
advice
on
having
someone
ride
pillion
with
me
on
my
ninja
this
will
be
the
the
first
time
ive
taken
anyone
for
an
extended
ride
read
farther
than
around
the
block
well
be
riding
some
twisty
fairly
bumpy
roads
the
mines
roadmthamilton
loop
for
you
sf
bay
areans
this
person
is
lbs
and
fairly
small
so
i
dont
see
weight
as
too
much
of
a
problem
but
what
sort
of
of
advice
should
i
give
her
before
we
go
my
fiancee
and
i
do
quite
a
bit
of
sporty
riding
ill
tell
you
what
weve
found
and
the
systems
weve
worked
out
on
starts
accelerate
much
slower
than
usual
its
tough
for
the
rider
to
judge
how
scary
fast
acceleration
is
because
were
holding
onto
something
and
leaning
forward
remember
this
on
turns
have
her
lean
forward
and
at
the
same
angle
as
you
normally
this
means
she
isnt
leaning
at
all
its
very
disconcerting
to
be
leaned
over
and
have
your
passenger
leaning
so
that
theyre
sitting
straight
up
much
balance
is
lost
and
this
can
be
dangerous
on
slowing
and
stopping
do
so
much
slower
than
usual
again
its
tough
for
the
rider
to
judge
how
scary
fast
deceleration
is
because
were
holding
onto
something
and
leaning
forward
however
youll
figure
it
out
fast
because
braking
too
fast
will
shove
the
passenger
forward
into
you
which
shoves
you
into
the
tank
at
an
inopportune
location
generally
have
the
passenger
keep
her
knees
against
you
and
the
bike
not
out
wide
this
helps
balance
and
gives
her
somegrip
when
you
passenger
is
in
fear
she
will
squeeze
her
knees
against
you
normally
this
means
slow
down
and
do
it
now
turning
so
she
leans
with
me
but
what
else
are
there
traditional
signals
for
slow
down
or
go
faster
or
i
hafta
go
pee
etc
we
only
have
a
couple
signals
slow
down
is
her
either
tapping
me
on
the
back
or
slapping
my
helmet
with
all
her
might
depends
on
the
urgency
of
the
matter
turn
here
is
done
by
her
pointing
in
the
direction
of
an
exit
this
is
also
the
sign
for
cool
look
at
that
i
hafta
pee
is
the
same
sign
as
turn
here
im
hungry
is
the
same
sign
go
faster
is
usually
done
by
her
jumping
up
and
down
on
her
pegs
in
glee
i
usually
see
slow
down
more
often
than
go
faster
i
really
want
this
to
be
a
positive
experience
for
us
both
mainly
so
that
shell
want
to
go
with
me
again
so
any
help
will
be
appreciated
the
best
thing
to
do
before
the
ride
is
to
talk
to
a
riding
buddy
and
pillion
on
his
or
her
bike
its
incredibly
frustrating
because
youre
in
almost
no
control
now
multiply
that
feeling
times
ten
because
you
as
a
rider
know
what
your
bike
will
do
and
your
passenger
will
likely
feel
youre
about
to
scrape
hard
parts
all
the
time
or
lock
up
the
brakes
at
any
moment
or
go
careening
off
the
edge
of
a
volcanic
mountain
etc
pillioning
yourself
is
good
training
to
take
somebody
on
your
pillion
pad
also
remember
that
its
much
more
draining
and
tiring
to
ride
than
by
yourself
because
youre
concentrating
on
much
more
and
in
the
zen
of
the
moment
less
