i
am
saying
is
that
you
dont
even
need
to
tell
people
mjsthe
technique
of
countersteering
cos
they
will
do
it
intuitively
the
first
mjstime
they
try

you
sure
remember
that
you
can
get
around
corners
without
karrcountersteering
in
fact
my
experienced
rider
course
instructors
karrclaimed
that
they
could
get
on
behind
a
new
rider
and
make
the
bike
karrturn
to
whichever
side
they
wanted
just
by
shifting
their
weight
karraround
even
when
the
operator
was
trying
to
turn
in
the
opposite
karrdirection
i
admit
ive
never
actually
seen
this
ive
experienced
this
back
when
i
was
younger
and
more
foolish
my
first
bike
used
to
track
extremely
true
going
down
the
highway
i
would
set
the
throttle
tension
screw
up
enough
to
hold
the
gas
steady
slide
back
on
the
seat
and
lean
against
the
backrest
riding
without
any
hands
if
i
needed
to
turn
id
shift
my
weight
into
the
turn
and
lo
and
behold
the
bike
would
turn
sans
touching
the
bars
granted
it
wouldnt
turn
very
fast
but
it
proves
that
you
can
turn
a
bike
without
countersteering
at
least
not
in
terms
of
the
input
to
the
bar
normally
associated
with
countersteering
as
ive
said
i
know
many
people
who
think
all
you
do
is
lean
and
any
input
theyre
giving
to
the
bar
is
totally
unconscious
whereas
that
may
be
sufficient
to
get
you
down
the
road
under
normal
circumstances
possibly
for
years
at
a
stretch
i
cant
think
of
anybody
whod
argue
that
this
is
preferable
to
properly
knowing
how
to
manipulate
the
bar
in
a
turn
regardless
of
what
you
want
to
call
it
except
maybe
