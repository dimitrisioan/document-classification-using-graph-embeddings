WRITES
I
JUST
GOT
BACK
FROM
THE
ANNUAL
SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA
HARLEY
DEALERS
ASSOCIATION
RUN
TO
THE
COLORADO
RIVER
CITY
OF
LAUGLIN
NEVADA
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
SOME
PEOPLE
CANT
ENJOY
THEMSELVES
WITHOUT
BEING
ASSHOLES
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
BE
TREATED
WITH
RESPECT
YOU
NEED
TO
TREAT
OTHERS
THEIR
PROPERTY
AND
THEIR
TOWNS
WITH
RESPECT
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
I
WAS
AT
THE
ANNUAL
FLYIN
OF
THE
EXPERIMENTAL
AIRCRAFT
ASSOCIATION
EAA
NEAR
OSHKOSH
WISCONSIN
ALTHOUGH
APPROXIMATELY
PEOPLE
WERE
IN
ATTENDANCE
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
PIECE
OF
LITTER
ANYWHERE
EVERYONE
WAS
CONSIDERATE
ENOUGH
TO
PLACE
THEIR
TRASH
WHERE
IT
BELONGED
THERES
NO
PROBLEM
IN
HAVING
FUN
RAISING
HELL
ETC
BUT
CONSIDERATION
AND
RESPECT
FOR
OTHERS
IS
CRITICAL
WE
NEED
TO
WORK
WITH
EACH
OTHER
NOT
AGAINST
NUDITY
FINELOUD
NOISE
FINEPARTY
ALL
NIGHT
FINE
BUT
AT
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
AND
TIME
PLEASE
LETS
NOT
TRAMPLE
OVER
OTHERS
RIGHTS
AND
THEN
BITCH
BECAUSE
THEY
DONT
TREAT
US
LIKE
GODS
MICHAEL
MENARD
YOU
KNOW
I
WASNT
EVEN
GOING
TO
RESPOND
TO
THIS
TYPICAL
ANTIPARTY
ATTITUDE
MESSAGE
TRASH
WAS
EVERYWHERE
REASON
NOT
ENOUGH
DIPSY
DUMPSTERS
FOR
THE
MASSIVE
CROWD
OATMAN
WASNT
PREPARED
FOR
THE
VAST
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
SHOWED
UP
BTW
MICHAEL
OATMAN
IS
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
TIME
ITS
CALLED
A
RUN
MAYBE
YOU
DIDNT
READ
MY
COMMENT
THAT
THEY
LOVED
US
AND
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
MERCHANTS
AND
TOWNSPEOPLE
THE
MERCHANTS
THAT
DIDNT
WANT
US
THEIR
SHOPS
WERE
CLOSED
MAYBE
I
SHOULD
HAVE
MENTIONED
THAT
WHEN
I
LEFT
THE
TRASH
WAS
BEING
PICKED
UP
ALUMINUM
SELLS
BY
A
CREW
ASSIGNED
TO
THE
TASK
I
THINK
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
HERE
IS
DO
THEY
WANT
US
BACK
THEY
DO
THIS
ACTION
THAT
WENT
ON
AT
OATMAN
IS
TYPICAL
ON
A
PREDOMINATLY
HARLEY
RUN
ITS
INNOCENT
FUN
SO
SINCE
I
ENJOY
TYPICAL
HARLEY
FUN
AT
RUNS
IN
YOUR
EYES
THAT
MAKES
ME
AN
ASSHOLE
IVE
ALREADY
ADMITTED
IM
AN
ASSHOLE
MANY
TIMES
ON
THE
NET
ALL
MY
FRIENDS
ARE
ASSHOLES
TOO
LYRICS
TO
A
NEW
SONG
SO
YOU
WANT
A
DIME
TO
CALL
SOMEONE
THAT
CARES
IT
APPEARS
WE
HAVE
A
DIFFERENCE
OF
OPINION
MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
LOOK
AT
THE
BIG
PICTURE
BEFORE
YOU
PASS
JUDGEMENT
ON
OTHERS
ANNUAL
THAT
SHOULD
TELL
YOU
SOMETHING
