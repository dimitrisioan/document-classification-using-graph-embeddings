SHARPE
WRITES
A
FEW
OF
US
ARE
TOURING
SOTHWEST
UTAH
IN
MID
JUNE
TO
SEE
THE
CANYONS
DO
ANY
OF
YOU
HAVE
SOME
HELPFUL
HINTS
ON
WHERE
TO
STAY
OR
THINGS
TO
SEEDOAVOID
PLANS
ARE
TO
SEE
BRYCE
ZION
ARCHES
IS
THE
GRAND
CLOSE
AT
THAT
POINT
OR
IS
AN
ADDITIONAL
TRIP
REQUIRED
ANY
HELP
WOULD
BE
NICE
THANK
YOU
FOR
YOUR
SUPPORT
SPRING
BREAK
I
WENT
THROUGH
THE
FOUR
CORNERS
AREA
AND
BACK
THE
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
STOP
I
MADE
WAS
IN
UTAH
AT
THE
NEEDLES
OVERLOOK
THOUGH
THIS
IS
A
BIT
FURTHER
EAST
THAN
WHERE
YOU
APPEAR
TO
BE
GOING
I
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
IT
IMHO
IT
IS
FAR
MORE
BEAUTIFUL
THAN
THE
GRAND
CANYON
IT
WAS
NOT
WELL
MARKED
BUT
WAS
ONE
OF
FEW
PAVED
ROADS
OFF
OF
I
WAS
HEADING
NORTH
FROM
MONTICELLO
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
TO
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
I
SHOULD
CLARIFY
THAT
IT
IS
THE
NEEDLES
OVERLOOK
AND
NOT
THE
RECREATION
AREA
HEADING
NORTH
FROM
MONTICELLO
IT
IS
THE
SECOND
TURNOFF
AND
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
MARKED
AS
THE
ANTICLINE
OVERLOOK
ANTICLINE
OVERLOOK
IS
ABOUT
DIRT
IF
THIS
MATTERS
TO
YOU
MILES
PAST
THE
NEEDLES
OVERLOOK
THE
ROAD
OUT
TO
THE
OVERLOOK
IS
PAVED
AND
REASONABLY
MAINTAINED
I
RAN
IT
ABOUT
LOOKING
OUT
FROM
THE
OVERLOOK
WAS
LIKE
BEING
GOD
AND
LOOKING
DOWN
ON
THE
WORLD
IF
IT
ISNT
TOO
FAR
OUT
OF
YOUR
WAY
YOU
SHOULD
SEE
IT

I
CANT
STAND

PROLIFERATION

PAPERWORK

ITS
USELESS

FIGHT

FORMS
YOUVE
GOT
