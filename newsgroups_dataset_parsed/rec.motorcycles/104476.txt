WRITES
MJSALSO
IMHO
TELLING
NEWBIES
ABOUT
COUNTERSTEERING
IS
ER
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
MJSCOS
IT
JUST
CONFUSES
THEM
I
RODE
AROUND
QUITE
HAPPILY
FOR
YEARS
MJSKNOWING
NOTHING
ABOUT
COUNTERSTEERING
I
CANNOT
SAY
I
RIDE
ANY
DIFFERENTLY
MJSNOW
THAT
I
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
I
INTERPRET
THIS
TO
MEAN
THAT
YOURE
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
EVERY
OTHER
MOTORCYCLIST
IN
THE
WORLD
EH
MIKE
RATHER
PRESUMPTIVE
OF
YOU
IMHO
IN
MY
HUMBLE
OPINION
LEAVITTCSUMDEDU
MR
BILL
WRITES
LEAVITTTHE
TIME
TO
LEARN
COUNTERSTEERING
TECHNIQUES
IS
WHEN
YOU
ARE
FIRST
LEAVITTSTARTING
TO
LEARN
BEFORE
YOU
DEVELOP
ANY
BAD
HABITS
I
RODE
FOR
LEAVITTFIVE
YEARS
BEFORE
TAKING
MY
FIRST
COURSE
MSF
ERC
AND
LEARNING
LEAVITTABOUT
HOW
TO
COUNTERSTEER
ITS
NOW
EIGHT
YEARS
LATER
AND
I
STILL
LEAVITTHAVE
TO
CONSCIOUSLY
TELL
MYSELF
DONT
STEER
COUNTERSTEER
OLD
LEAVITTHABITS
DIE
HARD
AND
BAD
HABITS
EVEN
HARDER
MJSSORRY
BILL
BUT
THIS
IS
COMPLETE
BOLLOCKS
YOU
LEARNED
HOW
TO
COUNTERSTEER
MJSTHE
FIRST
TIME
YOU
RODE
THE
BIKE
ITS
NATURAL
AND
INTUITIVE
SORRY
MIKE
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
KICK
OVER
THE
CAN
YOU
NOT
COUNTERSTEER
OVER
STONE
THAT
ONES
BEEN
KICKED
AROUND
ENOUGH
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
ILL
CONCEDE
THAT
ITS
COUNTERSTEERING
SAKE
OF
ARGUMENT
ONLY
MJSMSF
DID
NOT
TEACH
YOU
HOW
TO
COUNTERSTEER
IT
ONLY
TOLD
YOU
WHAT
MJSYOU
WERE
ALREADY
DOING
AND
THERES
NO
VALUE
IN
THAT
I
DIDNT
SAY
THERE
WAS
NO
VALUE
ALL
I
SAID
WAS
THAT
IT
IS
VERY
CONFUSING
TO
NEWBIES
THERES
A
BIG
DIFFERENCE
IN
KNOWING
WHATS
HAPPENING
AND
HOW
TO
MAKE
IT
DO
IT
ESPECIALLY
IN
THE
EXTREME
CASE
OF
AN
EMERGENCY
SWERVE
AND
JUST
LETTING
THE
BIKE
DO
WHATEVER
IT
DOES
TO
MAKE
ITSELF
TURN
ONCE
I
KNEW
PRECISELY
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
AND
HOW
TO
MAKE
IT
DO
IT
ABRUPTLY
AND
ON
COMMAND
MY
EMERGENCY
AVOIDANCE
ABILITIES
IMPROVED
TENFOLD
NOT
TO
MENTION
A
BIG
IMPROVEMENT
IN
MY
NORMAL
CORNERING
ABILITY
I
AM
MUCH
MORE
PROFICIENT
KNOWING
HOW
TO
COUNTERSTEER
THE
MOTORCYCLE
RATHER
THAN
LETTING
THE
MOTORCYCLE
STEER
ITSELF
THAT
IS
WHEN
I
REMEMBER
TO
TAKE
COGNITIVE
COMMAND
OF
THE
BIKE
RATHER
THAN
LETTING
IT
RUN
ITSELF
THROUGH
THE
CORNERS
WHEREUPON
I
RETURN
TO
MY
ORIGINAL
COMMENT
BETTER
TO
LEARN
WHATS
HAPPENING
RIGHT
FROM
THE
START
AND
HOW
TO
TAKE
CHARGE
OF
IT
RATHER
THAN
DEVELOPING
THE
BAD
HABIT
OF
MERELY
GOING
ALONG
FOR
THE
RIDE
BILL
YOU
ARE
KIDDING
YOURSELF
HERE
FIRSTLY
MOTORCYCLES
DO
NOT
STEER
THEMSELVES
ONLY
THE
RIDER
CAN
DO
THAT
SECONDLY
IT
IS
THE
ADHESION
OF
THE
TYRE
ON
THE
ROAD
THE
SUSPENSION
GEOMETRY
AND
THE
GROUND
CLEARANCE
OF
THE
MOTORCYCLE
WHICH
DICTATE
HOW
QUICKLY
YOU
CAN
SWERVE
TO
AVOID
OBSTACLES
AND
NOT
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
PHYSICS
BETWEEN
THE
RIDERS
EARS
ARE
YOU
SERIOUSLY
SUGGESTING
THAT
COUNTERSTEERING
KNOWLEDGE
ENABLES
YOU
TO
CORNER
FASTER
OR
MORE
COMPETENTLY
THAN
YOU
COULD
MANAGE
OTHERWISE
MIKE
IM
EXTREMELY
GRATIFIED
FOR
YOU
THAT
YOU
HAVE
SUCH
A
NATURAL
AFFINITY
AND
PROWESS
FOR
MOTORCYCLING
THAT
FORMAL
TRAINING
WAS
A
TOTAL
WASTE
OF
TIME
FOR
YOU
ASSUMING
YOUR
TOTAL
TRAINING
HASNT
COME
FROM
SIMPLY
FROM
READING
RECMOTORCYCLES
HOWEVER
OF
THE
MOTORCYCLISTS
IVE
DISCUSSED
FORMAL
RIDER
EDUCATION
WITH
HAVE
REGARDED
THE
EXPERIENCE
AS
OVERWHELMINGLY
POSITIVE
THIS
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
AMOUNT
OF
EXPERIENCE
THEY
BROUGHT
INTO
THE
COURSE
RANGING
FROM
MINUTES
TO
YEARS
FORMAL
TRAINING
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
AS
FAR
AS
I
AM
AWARE
DOES
NOT
INCLUDE
COUNTERSTEERING
THEORY
I
FOUND
OUT
ABOUT
COUNTERSTEERING
ABOUT
SIX
YEARS
AGO
FROM
A
PHYSICS
LECTURER
WHO
WAS
ALSO
A
MOTORCYCLIST
I
DIDNT
BELIEVE
HIM
AT
FIRST
WHEN
HE
SAID
I
STEERED
MY
BIKE
TO
THE
RIGHT
TO
MAKE
IT
TURN
LEFT
BUT
I
WENT
OUT
AND
ANALYSED
CLOSELY
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING
AND
REALIZED
HE
WAS
RIGHT
ITS
AN
INTERESTING
BIT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
IVE
HAD
A
LOT
OF
FUN
SINCE
THEN
TELLING
OTHERS
ABOUT
IT
WHO
WERE
AT
FIRST
AS
SCEPTICAL
AS
I
WAS
BUT
THATS
ALL
IT
IS
AN
INTERESTING
BIT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
TO
CLAIM
THAT
IT
IS
ESSENTIAL
FOR
ALL
BIKERS
TO
KNOW
IT
OR
THAT
YOU
CAN
CORNER
FASTER
OR
BETTER
AS
A
RESULT
IS
ABSURD
FORMAL
TRAINING
IS
IN
MY
VIEW
ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL
IF
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
RIDE
A
BIKE
PROPERLY
AND
SAFELY
BUT
BY
INCLUDING
COUNTERSTEERING
THEORY
IN
NEWBIE
COURSES
WE
ARE
CONFUSING
PEOPLE
UNNECESSARILY
RIGHT
AT
THE
TIME
WHEN
THERE
ARE
FAR
MORE
IMPORTANT
MATTERS
FOR
THEM
TO
LEARN
AND
THAT
WAS
MY
ORIGINAL
POINT
