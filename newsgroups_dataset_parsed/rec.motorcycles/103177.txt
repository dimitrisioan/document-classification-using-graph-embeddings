I
SPRAINED
MY
RIGHT
ANKLE
ONCE
AND
KEPT
RIDING
WHEN
I
BROKE
MY
RIGHT
LEG
IN
TWO
PLACES
I
HAD
KNEE
SURGERY
WHILE
I
WAS
IN
THE
NAVY
BACK
IN
THE
DOCTORS
PUT
ME
IN
A
CAST
FROM
ASSTOANKLE
MY
ONLY
METHOD
OF
TRANSPORTAION
WAS
A
DOHC
HONDA
AT
THE
TIME
I
FOUND
THAT
BY
SLIDING
BACK
ON
THE
SEAT
I
COULD
USE
MY
HEEL
DID
I
MENTION
IT
WAS
MY
LEFT
LEG
TO
OPERATE
THE
SHIFT
I
WOULD
HOOK
THE
END
OF
THE
LEVER
WITH
MY
HEEL
AND
LIFT
MY
ENTIRE
LEG
FOR
UP
SHIFTS
AND
JUST
DROP
MY
LEG
ON
THE
LEVER
FOR
THE
DOWNSHIFTS
FORGET
NUTRAL
TOOK
WAY
TOO
MUCH
FINESSE
FOR
THE
LEG
THE
CRUTCHES
WERE
BUNGEE
CORDED
TO
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
OF
THE
BIKE
WITH
THE
TOP
RESTING
ON
THE
PASSENGER
PEG
AND
THE
RIGHT
TURNSIGNAL
STICKING
THROUGH
THE
HOLE
IN
THE
CRUTCHES
EVERY
OTHER
DAY
WHEN
I
RODE
THE
MILES
TO
PHYSICAL
THERAPY
TOURTURE
SESSIONS
THE
DOC
WOULD
GIVE
ME
HELL
ABOUT
RIDING
A
BIKE
MUCH
LESS
RIDING
IN
MY
CONDITION
DIDNT
STOP
ME
THO
BP
BTW
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
BIKE
I
ASSEMBLED
IN
MY
SECOND
FLOOR
BARRACKS
ROOM
AND
RODE

IT
WAS
COMPLETED

AM
NOT
