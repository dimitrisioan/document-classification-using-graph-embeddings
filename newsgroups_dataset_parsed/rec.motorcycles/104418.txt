STICKY
LABELS
PRINTED
WITH
YOUR
FAVOURITE
CURSE
ARE
GOOD
EVEN
OUR
LOCAL
HOSPITALS
USE
THEM
INSTEAD
OF
WHEEL
CLAMPS
PUTTING
ONE
ABOUT
SIZE
ON
EACH
WINDOW
OF
THE
CAGE
AN
APARTMENT
COMPLEX
WHERE
I
USED
TO
LIVE
TRIED
THIS
ONLY
THEY
PUT
THE
THING
OVER
THE
DRIVERS
WINDOW
SO
THEY
COULDNT
MISS
IT
A
FRIEND
DAMNED
NEAR
WRECKED
ON
THE
WAY
HOME
ONE
NIGHT
HER
VISION
BLOCKED
BY
THE
STICKER
I
SUGGESTED
TO
THE
MANAGER
THE
ENORMOUS
LIABILITY
THEY
WERE
ASSUMING
BY
PULLING
THAT
STUNT
NOT
THAT
LOGIC
HAS
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
BUT
I
CAN
SEE
THE
LIABILITY
OF
PUTTING
STICKERS
ON
THE
CAR
WHILE
IT
WAS
MOVING
OR
SOMETHING
BUT
ITS
THE
BDI
THAT
CHOOSES
TO
START
AND
THEN
DRIVE
THE
CAR
IN
A
KNOWN
UNSAFE
CONDITION
THAT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
LIABLE
FURTHERMORE
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
THE
LAST
CHANCE
TO
AVOID
AN
UNSAFE
SITUATION
WHICH
IS
AN
ADDITIONAL
FACTOR
IN
ATTRIBUTING
BLAME
ANYWAY
STICKERS
ON
THE
WINDOW
ARE
LESS
EFFECTIVE
NO
ONE
HAS
ANY
PROBLEM
TAKING
A
BLADE
TO
A
WINDOW
TO
REMOVE
A
STUBBORN
STICKER
BUT
ITS
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
WITH
THAT
THAT
NICE
PAINT
JOB
ON
THE
DOOR
