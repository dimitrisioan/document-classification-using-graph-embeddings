WERT
WRITES
ARE
THERE
TRADITIONAL
SIGNALS
FOR
SLOW
DOWN
OR
GO
FASTER
OR
I
HAFTA
GO
PEE
ETC
MY
EXPERIENCE
IS
WHEN
THEY
POUND
THEIR
FISTS
ON
YOUR
BACK
IT
MEANS
SLOW
DOWN
SERIOUSLY
CONCENTRATE
ON
BEING
VERY
SMOOTH
AND
YOU
WILL
MAKE
HER
EXPERIENCE
MUCH
MORE
ENJOYABLE
EVEN
A
NORMAL
UPSHIFT
CAUSES
YOUR
PASSENGER
TO
BOB
SO
I
EASE
OFF
THE
THROTTLE
BEFORE
PULLING
IN
THE
CLUTCH
TO
ELIMINATE
THIS
ITS
MORE
WORK
BUT
YOUR
PASSENGER
WILL
APPRECIATE
IT
ALSO
IVE
FOUND
THAT
USING
MORE
REAR
BRAKE
THAN
NORMAL
HELPS
KEEP
THE
BIKE
FROM
DIVING
AS
MUCH
DURING
ROUTINE
STOPS
WHICH
MAKES
IT
MUCH
EASIER
FOR
THE
PASSENGER
TO
HANG
ON
IF
YOURE
GOING
SPORT
RIDING
HAVE
THE
PASSENGER
REACH
AROUND
YOU
AND
BRACE
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
THE
TANK
SO
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
BEAR
BOTH
YOUR
WEIGHTS
WITH
YOUR
ARMS
AGAIN
YOUR
BIKE
WILL
DIVE
LESS
