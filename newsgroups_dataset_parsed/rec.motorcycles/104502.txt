REMINDS
ME
OF
A
GREAT
EDITORIAL
BY
BRUCE
REEVE
A
COUPLE
MONTHS
AGO
IN
CYCLE
CANADA
HE
WAS
SO
PISSED
OFF
WITH
COPS
PULLING
OVER
SPEEDERS
IN
DANGEROUS
SPOTS
AND
OFTEN
BLIND
CORNERS
THAT
ONE
DAY
HE
DECIDED
TO
GET
REVENGE
CRUISING
ON
A
FACTORY
LOANER
TEST
BIKE
HE
NOTICED
A
COP
HAD
PULLED
OVER
A
MOTORIST
ON
AN
ON
OR
OFF
RAMP
WITH
ALMOST
NO
SHOULDER
BEING
A
BRIGHT
LAD
HE
HIT
HIS
BIKES
KILL
SWITCH
JUST
BEFORE
PASSING
THE
COP
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
BE
BENDING
TOWARDS
THE
OFFENDING
MOTORIST
THEREBY
EXPOSING
HIS
GLUTES
TO
THE
PASSING
WORLD
WITH
HIS
IGNITION
SYSTEM
NOW
DEAD
HE
PUMPED
HIS
THROTLE
TWO
OR
THREE
TIMES
TO
FILL
HIS
EXHAUST
CANISTERS
WITH
VOLATILE
RAW
FUEL
ALL
IT
TOOK
WAS
A
STAB
AT
THE
KILL
SWITCH
TO
RELIGHT
THE
IGNITION
AND
SEND
A
FLAME
IN
SARGEANT
SWELLS
DIRECTION
I
WONDER
IF
ANY
CYCLE
COPS
READ
CYCLE
CANADA
ALTHOUGH
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
ACTION
I
DO
HOPE
THAT
THE
RIDER
PONIED
UP
THE
OR
SO
IT
TAKES
TO
REPLACE
THE
EXHAUST
SYSTEM
HE
JUST
DESTROYED
THE
OWNERS
MANUAL
EXPLICITLY
WARNS
AGAINST
SUCH
BEHAVIOR
FOR
EXACTLY
THAT
REASON
YOU
CAN
DESTROY
YOUR
MUFLERS
THAT
WAY

NEC
NEEDS
A

AGREE
WITH
ANY
OF
THIS
ANYWAY
I
WAS
RAISED
BY
A

OF

DOGS
YA
FAT
CHANCE
THE
OFFENDING
RIDER
WAS
A
MOTO
JOURNALIST
THOSE
GUYS
CAN
SELL
HUNDREDS
OF
BIKES
WITH
ONE
STROKE
OF
THE
PEN
AND
AS
SUCH
GET
AWAY
WITH
MURDER
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
TEST
BIKES
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
WORTH
THE
EARLY
EXPIRATION
OF
ONE
MUFLER
TO
SEE
A
BONE
HEAD
GET
HIS
BUTT
BAKED
