i
have
a
quick
question
i
recently
got
a
bike
and
drive
it
often
but
my
one
problem
is
the
wind
messing
with
my
contacts
i
have
gas
permeable
how
about
a
full
face
helmet
with
the
face
sheild
down
works
for
me
actually
this
doesnt
always
work
for
me
either
i
have
wind
that
blows
around
inside
my
some
and
itll
dry
my
eyes
out
get
dust
in
them
eventually
unless
im
also
wearing
sunglasses
inside
my
helmet
i
too
usually
wear
sunglasses
inside
my
full
face
helmet
to
keep
dirt
wind
out
of
my
contacts
