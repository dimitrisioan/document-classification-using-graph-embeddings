if
you
cant
youve
obviously
waited
too
long
or
are
not
putting
much
effort
into
it
my
lb
dog
not
always
used
to
fart
all
the
time
by
making
her
notice
it
of
course
the
smell
doesnt
bother
her
and
thence
kicking
her
outside
somewhat
literally
she
came
to
realize
that
she
shoudlnt
do
it
at
least
not
around
me
and
now
two
years
later
she
still
doesnt
so
how
big
is
this
dog
now
about
the
size
of
cow
ready
to
burst
whats
that
supposed
to
mean
shes
lbs
understand
english
she
let
wind
break
cause
i
fed
her
cheap
food
and
not
the
same
thing
every
time
so
she
had
to
adjust
to
each
different
brand
for
a
while
andy
infante
you
can
listen
to
what
everybody
says
but
the
fact
remains
bmw
that
youve
got
to
get
out
there
and
do
the
thing
yourself
dod
joan
sutherland
my
opinions
dammit
have
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
else
