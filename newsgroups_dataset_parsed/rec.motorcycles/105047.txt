RE
YAMAHA
LOCKS
WAS
COBRA
LOCK
ANY
LOCK
INCLUDING
THE
KYPTONITE
UTYPES
ARE
EASY
TO
BREAK
INTO
IF
THE
PERSON
HAS
THE
PROPER
SUPPLIES
ANDOR
MOTIVATION
MINUTES
AND
YOUR
BIKE
IS
GONE
I
WOULD
BE
GLAD
TO
EXPLAIN
BUT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
CONTRIBUTE
TO
ANY
UNLAWFUL
ACTIVITIES
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
I
HAVE
A
BIKE
THAT
I
WOULD
HATE
TO
SEE
RIPPED
OFF
BY
SUCH
A
TRIVAL
TACTIC
WARNING
NO
LOCK
ALONE
IS
A
SAFE
DETERENT
AGAINST
THEFT
THE
THIEF
DOESNT
NEED
TO
BE
A
LOCKSMITH
OR
A
LOCKPICKER
TO
WALK
AWAY
WITH
YOUR
PROPERTY
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
MOTION
ALARMS
IN
COMBINATION
TO
A
LOCK
OF
THIS
TYPE
IS
THE
WAY
TO
GO
IF
IN
FACT
YOU
ARE
THAT
CONCERNED
