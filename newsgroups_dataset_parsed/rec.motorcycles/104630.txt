A
SATURDAY
WITHOUT
MUCH
RAIN
IN
FACT
IT
CLEARED
UP
BECAME
WARM
AND
SUNNY
AND
THE
WIND
DIED
ABOUT
THREE
WEEKS
AGO
I
TOOK
A
LONG
COOL
RIDE
ON
THE
HAWK
DOWN
TO
CYCLES
FOR
A
TEST
RIDE
THEY
HAD
SOLD
AND
DELIVERED
THE
DEMO
ABOUT
FIFTEEN
HOURS
BEFORE
I
ARRIVED
AND
THE
DEMO
VFR
WAS
BIKELOCKED
IN
THE
SHOWROOM
SURROUNDED
BY
OTHER
BIKES
AND
NOT
LIKELY
TO
MOVE
SOON
TODAY
WAS
DIFFERENT
THERE
WERE
EVEN
MORE
BIKES
USED
DIRT
BIKES
USED
STREET
BIKES
CARS
AND
A
BIG
TENT
FULL
OF
OUTLANDISHLY
FAT
TOURING
BIKES
WITH
TRAILERS
WERE
ALL
SQUEEZED
IN
THE
PARKING
LOT
SOME
SORT
OF
FAT
BIKE
CONVENTION
SHELLY
AND
DAVE
WERE
RUNNING
ONE
MSF
COURSE
EACH
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
ONE
IN
THE
CLASSROOM
AND
ONE
ON
THE
BACK
LOT
PLUS
THERE
WAS
THE
USUALL
FREE
COOKOUT
FOOD
THAT
CYCLES
GIVES
AWAY
EVERY
WEEKEND
IN
THE
SUMMER
HMMM
IT
SEEMED
LIKE
A
BIG
MOTO
PARTY
AFTER
ABOUT
TEN
MINUTES
OF
LOOKING
FOR
ROB
C
CHEIF
OF
SALES
SLIME
AND
ANOTHER
MINUTES

I
HELPED
JT
PUSH
THE
ST
OUT
INTO
THE
MESS
IN
THE
PARKING
LOT
WE
WENT
OVER
THE
THE
CONTROLS
I
PUT
THE
TANK
BAG
FROM
THE
HAWK
INTO
THE
RIGHT
SADDLEBAG
AND
MY
WIFE
PUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
INTO
THE
LEFT
SADDLEBAG
THATS
NICE
HAVING
HELPED
PUSH
THE
ST
OUT
TO
THE
LOT
I
THOUGHT
IT
BEST
TO
HAVE
JT
MOVE
IT
TO
THE
EDGE
OF
THE
ROAD
AWAY
FROM
THE
BIKES
AND
PEOPLE
HE
RODE
IT
LIKE
A
BICYCLE
IT
CANT
BE
THAT
HEAVY
I
THOUGHT
WELL
I
WAS
WRONG
AS
I
SAT
ON
THE
ST
BOTH
FEET
DOWN
ALL
I
COULD
THINK
WAS
BIG
THEN
I
PUT
ONE
FOOT
UP
HEAVY
CAME
TO
MIND
VERY
QUICKLY
WITH
CINDY
ON
THE
BACK
WAS
SHE
ON
THE

HARD
TO
TELL
WITH

THE

SEEMED
NEARLY
OUT
OF

JUST
IDLING
ON
THE

OF
THE
ROAD
BY

IN
SECOND

ALL
THE

SEEMED
TO
DISSAPPEAR
EVEN
