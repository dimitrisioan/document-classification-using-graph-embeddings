WROTE
NOW
FOR
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
READ
THIS
FAR
WHY
DID
IT
REV
AT
IDLE
LIKE
THAT
IS
WATER
IN
THE
FUEL
AN
ACCEPTABLE
REAASON
OR
WERE
THEY
HAVING
ME
ON
SOUND
LIKE
THE
PILOT
CIRCUIT
WAS
SAY
LEANCLOGGED
I
DONT
THINK
WATER
WOULD
CAUSE
A
PROBLEM
LIKE
THIS
BUT
APPARENTLY
THE
OIL
PUMP
IS
DOING
ITS
JOB
AND
THERE
WAS
PLENTY
OF
OIL
WHY
DID
IT
SEIZE
SEE
ABOVE
WERE
YOU
BY
CHANCE
COASTING
WHEN
IT
STUCK
ON
A
TWO
STROKE
YOU
ONLY
HAVE
SUBSTANTIAL
LUBRICATION
WHEN
YOU
ARE
GIVING
THE
BIKE
GAS
IF
IT
WAS
LEAN
ON
THE
PILOT
THATS
WHY
IT
STUCK
OH
BTW
THE
MOTOR
HAD
BEEN
REBUILT
JUST
BEFORE
I
LEFT
ADELAIDE
SO
HAD
DONE
ABOUT
MILES
WHEN
IT
BLEW
IT
WAS
REBUILT
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
BEEN
SEIZED
AT
SOME
TIME
BEFORE
WE
GOT
IT
AND
IT
LOOKED
LIKE
THAT
SEIZURE
HAD
HAPPENED
AT
LOW
MILEAGE
BECAUSE
THERE
WERE
STILL
HONE
MARKS
IN
THE
BORE
THE
REBUILD
WE
DID
CONSISTED
OF
A
TOTAL
TEAR
DOWN
NEW
PISTON
RINGS
SMALL
END
BEARING
AND
NEW
GEARBOX
BEARINGS
BIG
END
AND
ROD
JUDGED
OK
ANY
IDEAS
FOLKS

MENTIONED
AN
AFTERMARKET
CARB

DELETED
