it
faces
stiff
opposition
in
the
senate
recently
the
highway
patrol
took
a
few
of
the
opposition
senators
out
and
gave
them
some
shots
and
when
they
hit
put
them
on
a
course
dodging
cones
they
failed
and
will
probably
change
their
votes
as
a
result
did
they
try
to
do
the
course
before
having
a
few
drinks
i
dont
see
a
senator
that
has
is
fat
but
driven
around
in
a
limo
being
a
good
driver
no
mater
how
many
drinks
he
has
had
before
jnm
yeah
really
no
shit
like
that
jerk
loch
faircloth
that
couldnt
win
an
election
as
a
democrat
so
he
switches
to
republican
the
year
before
this
past
election
and
takes
terry
sanford
out
with
his
bitch
and
moan
campaigning
typical
of
nc

swear
id
kick

got
the
chance
maybe

fucking
clue
as
to
how
the
rest
of
the
world
lives

you
can
listen
to
what
everybody
says
but
the
fact
remains
bmw
that
youve
got
to
get
out
there
and
do
the
thing
yourself

anyone
else
