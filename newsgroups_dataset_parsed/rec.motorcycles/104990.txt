i
cant
help
myself
ive
tried
to
be
rational
to
look
the
other
way
but
everytime
it
happens
its
uncontrollable
i
hate
motorcycles
hah
newbie
bait
everyone
knows
the
first
motorcycle
wasnt
built
until
there
were
no
motorcycles
at
first
i
thought
it
was
a
phase
i
though
i
would
get
used
to
them
it
didnt
happen
i
tried
gazing
at
and
customs
but
each
time
i
sadistically
pictured
them
being
hurled
off
of
large
precipice
i
also
picture
a
swarm
of
german
tourists
cheering
and
taking
holiday
snaps
but
i
cant
figure
that
part
out
youve
been
watching
too
much
northern
exposure
what
am
i
to
do
everytime
i
read
a
sig
containing
some
spoked
wheel
wonder
i
shudder
and
feel
pity
that
the
poor
soul
has
suffered
enough
why
because
our
wheels
are
repairable
i
imagine
the
owner
scrapping
out
his
or
her
living
in
a
discarded
maytag
refridgerator
box
tucked
in
next
to
their
humph
obviously
more
bait
everyone
knows
you
dont
discard
maytag
boxes
even
after
theyve
become
uninhabitable
theyre
make
a
great
poor
boys
mechanics
creeper
whazzat
im
hoping
for
some
deliverance
okay
lets
hear
you
squeal
like
a
pig
i
had
in
the
past
loathed
the
milwaukee
machine
but
i
can
actually
begin
to
understand
some
of
the
preaching
there
must
be
hope
beware
fanatical
preaching
lest
the
residents
of
waco
texas
set
up
a
huge
salad
bar
in
your
honor
