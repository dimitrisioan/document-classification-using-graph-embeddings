I
CANT
HELP
MYSELF
IVE
TRIED
TO
BE
RATIONAL
TO
LOOK
THE
OTHER
WAY
BUT
EVERYTIME
IT
HAPPENS
ITS
UNCONTROLLABLE
I
HATE
MOTORCYCLES
HAH
NEWBIE
BAIT
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THE
FIRST
MOTORCYCLE
WASNT
BUILT
UNTIL
THERE
WERE
NO
MOTORCYCLES
AT
FIRST
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
A
PHASE
I
THOUGH
I
WOULD
GET
USED
TO
THEM
IT
DIDNT
HAPPEN
I
TRIED
GAZING
AT
AND
CUSTOMS
BUT
EACH
TIME
I
SADISTICALLY
PICTURED
THEM
BEING
HURLED
OFF
OF
LARGE
PRECIPICE
I
ALSO
PICTURE
A
SWARM
OF
GERMAN
TOURISTS
CHEERING
AND
TAKING
HOLIDAY
SNAPS
BUT
I
CANT
FIGURE
THAT
PART
OUT
YOUVE
BEEN
WATCHING
TOO
MUCH
NORTHERN
EXPOSURE
WHAT
AM
I
TO
DO
EVERYTIME
I
READ
A
SIG
CONTAINING
SOME
SPOKED
WHEEL
WONDER
I
SHUDDER
AND
FEEL
PITY
THAT
THE
POOR
SOUL
HAS
SUFFERED
ENOUGH
WHY
BECAUSE
OUR
WHEELS
ARE
REPAIRABLE
I
IMAGINE
THE
OWNER
SCRAPPING
OUT
HIS
OR
HER
LIVING
IN
A
DISCARDED
MAYTAG
REFRIDGERATOR
BOX
TUCKED
IN
NEXT
TO
THEIR
HUMPH
OBVIOUSLY
MORE
BAIT
EVERYONE
KNOWS
YOU
DONT
DISCARD
MAYTAG
BOXES
EVEN
AFTER
THEYVE
BECOME
UNINHABITABLE
THEYRE
MAKE
A
GREAT
POOR
BOYS

HOPING
FOR
SOME
DELIVERANCE
OKAY
LETS
HEAR
YOU
SQUEAL
LIKE
A
PIG
I
HAD
IN
THE
PAST
LOATHED
THE
MILWAUKEE
MACHINE
BUT
I
CAN
ACTUALLY
BEGIN
TO
UNDERSTAND
SOME
OF
THE
PREACHING
THERE
MUST
BE
HOPE
BEWARE
FANATICAL
PREACHING
