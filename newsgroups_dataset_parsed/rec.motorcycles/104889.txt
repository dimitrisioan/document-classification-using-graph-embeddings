BMW
MAILING
LIST
RBPNETCOMCOM
BOB
PASKER
WRITES
IT
WOULD
BE
A
SHAME
TO
SPLIT
BOXER
RIDERS
BETWEEN
DIFFERENT
LISTS
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
THE
EXISTING
LIST
FAILED
TO
MEET
THE
READERS
NEEDS
NOWHERE

CONSIDERING
THAT
THE

WENT
TO
WITHIN
HOURS
OF
MY
INITIAL
POST
ABOUT

MADE
AROUND
JUST
BEFORE

WENT
TO
BED
ID
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
A
NEED
FOR
A
BMW
LIST
AS
OPPOSED
TO
JUST
A
GS
BOXER
LIST
MY
MOTIVATION
FOR
SETTING
UP
THE
BMW
LIST
CAME
FROM
AN
EARLIER
POST
OF
YOURS
ANNOUNCING
YOUR
BOXER
LIST
IT
DIDNT
FIT
MY
NEEDS
OK

PISSED
