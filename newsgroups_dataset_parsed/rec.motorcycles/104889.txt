it
would
be
a
shame
to
split
boxer
riders
between
different
lists
unless
of
course
the
existing
list
failed
to
meet
the
readers
needs
nowhere
did
i
see
you
mention
k
bikes
which
being
made
by
bmw
are
welcome
on
my
list
in
fact
you
go
out
of
your
way
to
say
most
all
boxer
talk
is
welcome
your
list
appears
to
cater
to
boxers
thats
great
my
list
caters
to
bmws
without
any
restrictions
like
you
have
considering
that
the
subscription
count
went
to
within
hours
of
my
initial
post
about
the
list
which
was
made
around
just
before
i
went
to
bed
id
say
that
there
is
a
need
for
a
bmw
list
as
opposed
to
just
a
gs
boxer
list
my
motivation
for
setting
up
the
bmw
list
came
from
an
earlier
post
of
yours
announcing
your
boxer
list
it
didnt
fit
my
needs
ok
weve
pissed
on
each
others
list
lets
get
back
to
the
regular
netnoise
and
read
our
respective
lists
