the

stops
a
foot
behind
my
rear
wheel
i
understand
why
you
theoretically
stop
so
far
behind
a
car
but
can
you
really
in
actuality
avoid
such
an
incident
suggestions
anybody
who
drove
into
somebody
like
that
in
this
country
would
hopefully
lose
their
licence
however
the
avoidance
is
simple
dont
stop
behind
the
cage
stop
beside
it
or
better
still
in
front
of
it
so
that
it
acts
as
a
buffer
