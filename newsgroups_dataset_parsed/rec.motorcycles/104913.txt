OFFERS
THE
GRIPS
ON
MY
GS
ARE
A
WONDERFUL
THING
IN
THE
WINTER
AND
NO
PROBLEM
IN
THE
SUMMER
VIBRATION
BMWS
DONT
VIBRATE
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
ID
AGREE
WITH
HENRY
THE
GRIPS
ARE
REALLY
NICE
TO
HAVE
IN
WINTER
AND
ARENT
NOTICABLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
NORMAL
GRIPS
IN
SUMMER
MY
ONLY
COMPLAINT
IS
THAT
THE
LOW
SETTING
MIGHT
AS
WELL
BE
OFF
THIS
HAS
BEEN
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
BY
EVERY
REVIEWER
OFFICIAL
AND
UNOFFICIAL
THATS
EVER
TALKED
ABOUT
THESE
GRIPS
THE
HIGH
SETTING
IS
OFTEN
TOO
HIGH
FOR
USE
WITH
LIGHTWEIGHT
SUMMER
GLOVES
WHEN
THINGS
JUST
GET
A
BIT
NIPPY
BUT
SINCE
LOW
DOESNT
PRODUCE
A
NOTICABLE
EFFECT
I
END
UP
TURNING
THE
GRIPS
ON
AND
OFF
TO
KEEP
THE
TEMPERATURE
ABOUT
RIGHT
THIS
GENERALLY
ISNT
A
PROBLEM
WHEN
WEARING
THICKER
WINTER
GLOVES
WHEN
I
ASKED
THE
DEALER
IF
THEY
COULD
FIX
IT
I
RECEIVED
A
CONSOLING
PAT
ON
THE
BACK
AND
THEIR
SINCERE
APOLOGIES
FOR
THE
POOR
DESIGN
ACTUALLY
I
WAS
TOLD
THEY
WORKED
JUST
LIKE
THEY
WERE
SUPPOSE
TO
VIBRATION
WHATS
THAT
I
RIDE
A
BMW
TWIN
YOU
CAN
BARELY
TELL
IF
THE
ENGINE
IS
FIRED
UP
OR
NOT
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
SMOOTHER
THAN
SILK
