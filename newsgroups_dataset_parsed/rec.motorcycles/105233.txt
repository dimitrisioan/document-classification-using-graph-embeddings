WHY
NOT
CHARGE
AND
STORE
DRY
QUITE
RIGHT
YOUR
BATTERIES
SHOULD
BE
PERFECTLY
ALRIGHT
AND
RETAIN
MOST
OF
THEIR
CHARGE
IF
DRAINED
AND
DRIED
WELL
BUT
ID
THROW
OUT
THE
ELECTROLYTE
AND
BUY
SOME
MORE
WHEN
YOU
NEED
IT
AND
BEFORE
ANYONE
SAYS
IM
WRONG
REMEMBER
THAT
NEW
BATTERIES
ALMOST
ALWAYS
COME
READY
CHARGED
AND
DRY
AND
THEY
ARE
PERFECTLY
OK
EVEN
AFTER
SEVERAL
YEARS
