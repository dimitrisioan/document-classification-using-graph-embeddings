RE
WANTED
ADVICE
FOR
NEW
CYLIST
IN
ARTICLE
BLAISECSRHPCOM
BLAISE
CIRELLI
WRITES
SO
THE
QUESTION
I
HAVE
IS
HOW
DANGEROUS
IS
RIDING
TOUGH
QUESTION
MORE
DANGEROUS
THAN
DRIVING
A
CAR
AND
FAR
MORE
DANGEROUS
IF
YOU
DONT
APPLY
A
MODICUM
OF
INTELLIGENCE
TO
THE
ACTIVITY
BASICALLY
STUPIDITY
WILL
GET
YOU
HURTKILLED
A
LOT
FASTER
ON
A
MOTORCYCLE
THAN
IN
A
CAR
BUT
WITH
CARE
IT
IS
NOT
UNREASONABLY
DANGEROUS
ALSO
BUYING
GOOD
PROTECTIVE
CLOTHING
IS
HELPFUL
THAT
WAY
IF
SOMETHING
DOES
GO
WRONG
YOU
ARE
LIKELY
TO
BE
LESS
SEVERELY
INJURED
FIRST
THING
IF
POSSIBLE
TAKE
A
MSF
DRIVER
TRAINING
COURSE
THIS
WILL
GET
YOU
STARTED
ON
THE
RIGHT
FOOT
THEY
TEACH
CONTROL
OF
THE
VEHICLE
AND
SAFE
RIDING
PRACTICES
SECOND
BUY
PROTECTIVE
GEAR
AT
MINIMUM
A
GOOD
HELMET
AND
A
PAIR
OF
LEATHER
GLOVES
ARE
A
MUST
A
GOOD
STURDY
PIECE
OF
FOOTGEAR
IS
ALSO
VERY
HELPFUL
THOUGH
LEATHER
HIKING
BOOTS
A
PAIR
OF
OLD
ARMY
BOOTS
OR
SOMETHING
SIMILAR
WORKS
FINE
FOR
THIS
PURPOSE
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
MAKE
SURE
THE
LACES
STAY
TIED
AFTER
THOSE
A
LEATHER
JACKET
AND
LEATHER
PANTS
OR
CHAPS
ARE
NICE
AS
WELL
BUT
THESE
ARE
ALSO
EXPENSIVE
ITEMS
FOR
THE
PANTS
MANY
PEOPLE
CONSIDER
A
GOOD
PAIR
OF
JEANS
TO
BE
REASONABLE
PREFERABLY
RECENT
AND
OF
A
FAIRLY
HEAVY
WEIGHT
SIMILARLY
FOR
A
JACKET
A
GOOD
JEAN
JACKET
IS
A
REASONABLE
COMPROMISE
THOUGH
MORE
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
HAVE
LEATHER
JACKETS
AROUND
THAN
PANTS
ANOTHER
THING
TO
DO
IS
DROP
IN
ON
GARAGE
SALES
LOOKING
FOR
A
SECONDHAND
LEATHER
JACKET
LOOK
FOR
A
FAIRLY
THICK
LEATHER
IN
THESE
ITEMS
THIRD
DONT
DO
ANYTHING
STUPID
DONT
RIDE
AFTER
DRINKING
EVEN
ONE
DRINK
CAN
NOTICEABLY
AFFECT
YOU
JUDGEMENT
AND
BALANCE
DONT
RIDE
IN
THE
SNOW
OR
WHEN
CONDITIONS
ARE
SUCH
THAT
BLACK
ICE
IS
LIKELY
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
RIDING
IN
THE
RAIN
SLOW
WAY
DOWN
TAKE
CORNERS
GINGERLY
BRAKE
EARLY
AND
GENTLY
TRY
NOT
TO
RIDE
IF
YOU
ARE
SICK
TIRED
TAKING
ANY
MEDICATION
WITH
DROWSINESS
WARNINGS
OR
OTHERWISE
NOT
IN
AVERAGE
SHAPE
WITH
CARE
YOU
SHOULD
BE
OK
THE
NEXT
QUESTION
I
HAVE
IS
WHAT
BIKE
WOULD
YOU
RECOMMEND
FOR
A
FIRST
TIME
RIDER
I
DONT
WANT
TO
RACE
NOR
DO
I
WANT
TO
RIDE
CROSS
COUNTRY
NOR
DO
I
WANT
TO
RIDE
ON
DIRT
TRAILS
ILL
PROBABLY
DRIVE
IT
ON
BACK
ROADS
WITH
OCCASIONAL
RIDES
ON
CITY
STREETS
AND
FREEWAYS
THE
MAXIMUM
I
CAN
SPEND
IS
ABOUT
SO
ILL
BE
LOOKING
AT
A
USED
BIKE
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
MID
TO
LATE
JAPANESE
MIDSIZED
STANDARD
SOMETHING
IN
CC
RANGE
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
REASONABLE
IF
YOU
ARE
SHORTERLIGHTER
THAN
AVERAGE
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
GO
AS
LOW
AS
A
CC
BIKE
POSSIBLE
MODELS
THE
SUZUKI
GS
SERIES
EG
ETC
THESE
ARE
GENERALLY
INLINE
BIKES
GENERALLY
DEPENDABLE
EXCEPT
FOR
A
TENDENCY
TO
WEAKNESS
IN
THE
CHARGING
SYSTEM
STATOR
ANDOR
REGULATORRECTIFIER
PROBLEMS
MY
FIRST
BIKE
WAS
A
ABOUT
IT
SERVER
ME
WELL
THE
HONDA
NIGHTHAWK
SERIES
THIS
MAY
ALSO
BE
KNOWN
AS
THE
CB
SERIES
I
THINK
EG
HONDA
ETC
THIS
IS
ANOTHER
SERIES
OF
STANDARD
MOTORCYCLES
ALSO
FAIRLY
DEPENDABLE
KAWASAKI
AND
YAMAHA
PROBABLY
HAVE
SIMILAR
BIKES
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
THEM
AS
WELL
FOR
MID
TO
LATE
MODELS
OF
THE
ABOVE
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
BUY
THE
BIKE
FOR
UNDER
LEAVING
YOU
MONEY
FOR
PROTECTIVE
CLOTHING
AND
INSURANCE
AND
LICENSING
COSTS
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
