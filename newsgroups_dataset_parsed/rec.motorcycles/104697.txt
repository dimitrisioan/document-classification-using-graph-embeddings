a
kinder
gentler
bmw
mailing
list
i
know
theres
already
a
bmw
mailing
list
but
since
its
an
r
bike
only
list
and
limited
to
the
bikes
as
well
i
believe
ive
decided
to
give
this
a
go
and
see
how
much
interest
there
is
please
read
all
of
this
post
if
you
plan
on
subscribing
to
the
list
there
is
only
one
restriction
for
the
discussion
on
this
list
that
it
be
about
bmws
i
dont
care
which
bmw
any
and
all
are
welcome
i
will
probably
post
articles
that
appear
in
the
local
bmw
club
newsletter
and
would
incourage
other
club
members
to
do
the
same
especially
tech
articles
to
subscribe
to
the
list
send
a
message
to
the
list
address
bmwridercactusorg
with
the
word
subscribe
in
caps
in
the
subject
of
the
message
having
the
word
subscribe
in
the
subject
is
the
only
way
to
subscribe
if
you
put
the
keyword
in
the
message
body
your
message
will
go
out
to
everyone
on
the
list
and
you
will
be
ridiculed
beyond
belief
your
from
line
must
have
a
valid
return
address
the
list
sw
will
use
the
address
in
your
from
line
if
you
would
like
to
use
a
return
address
other
than
what
is
contained
in
your
from
line
do
not
send
mail
to
the
list
send
a
note
directly
to
me
joeridercactusorg
and
ill
take
care
of
it
manually
the
list
sw
will
hack
up
the
outgoing
message
from
line
so
that
your
original
full
name
in
s
is
preserved
but
the
return
address
is
replaced
with
the
mailing
list
address
bmwridercactusorg
this
allows
you
to
simply
reply
to
a
message
to
keep
it
on
the
list
depending
on
your
mail
interface
natch
i
use
elm
so
thats
what
i
wrote
it
for
keep
this
in
mind
when
you
reply
to
a
message
and
question
the
authors
parentage
to
remove
your
name
from
the
list
send
a
message
to
the
list
address
with
the
word
unsubscribe
in
caps
in
the
subject
of
the
message
having
the
word
unsubscribe
in
the
subject
is
the
only
way
to
remove
your
name
from
the
list
if
you
put
the
keyword
in
the
message
body
your
message
will
go
out
to
everyone
on
the
list
and
you
will
be
ridiculed
beyond
belief
the
list
is
run
from
my
home
system
a
poor
little
box
running
a
very
old
version
of
something
that
smells
somewhat
like
unix
the
mta
isnt
the
smartest
around
but
ive
managed
to
hack
it
up
enough
to
make
a
decent
list
mta
additions
and
removals
are
handled
automatically
by
scripts
that
intercept
messages
based
on
the
subject
see
below
and
may
occassionally
goof
the
sw
will
send
a
response
message
back
when
you
subscribe
if
you
do
not
receive
a
response
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
my
link
is
via
uucp
and
sometimes
runs
in
spurts
send
me
a
message
joeridercactusorg
and
ill
look
into
it
if
the
list
turns
out
to
be
too
popular
and
the
mta
groks
over
the
number
of
addresses
ill
have
to
freeze
the
list
recipients
until
i
can
come
up
with
a
better
mta
good
luck
