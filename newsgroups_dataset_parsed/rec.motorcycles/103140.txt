IDENTIFY
THIS
BIKE
FOR
ME
OK
I
SAW
A
BIKE
TODAY
AND
I
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHAT
IT
IS
LETS
BEGIN
BY
SAYING
THAT
ITS
WHOLE
REAR
END
WAS
DEFINATELY
HAWK
ADDITIONALLY
IT
HAD
A
STYLE
TANK
FULL
FAIRING
AND
ONLY
A
TACH
NOW
AT
FIRST
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
AN
A
HAWK
MODIFIED
BY
TWO
BROTHERS
RACING
BUT
I
DID
NOT
THINK
THAT
THEY
MADE
THIS
HUGE
TANK
FOR
IT
ADDITIONALLY
THE
GAUGES
WERE
CERTAINLY
NOT
FROM
A
HAWK
THEY
LOOKED
MUCH
MORE
LIKE
GAUGES
OVERALL
THE
BIKE
LOOKED
LIKE
A
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
REAR
SINGLESIDED
SWINGARM
AND
WHEEL
THERE
WERE
STRAIGHT
FROM
THE
HAWK
SO
WHAT
DID
I
SEE
PS
FOR
ANY
OF
YOU
BOULDER
DODERS
I
SAW
IT
PARKED
AT
THE
ENGINEERING
CENTER
TODAY
IT
IS
WHITE
WITH
LIGHT
GREEN
STRIPES
