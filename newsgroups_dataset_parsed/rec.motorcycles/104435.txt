AS
A
NEW
BMW
OWNER
I
WAS
THINKING
ABOUT
SIGNING
UP
FOR
THE
MOA
BUT
RIGHT
NOW
IT
IS
BEGINNING
TO
LOOK
SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE
THROWING
MONEY
DOWN
A
RATHOLE
IM
GOING
TO
LET
MY
CURRENT
MEMBERSHIP
LAPSE
WHEN
ITS
UP
FOR
RENEWAL
HESH
IN
MY
CASE
THATS
NOT
FOR
ANOTHER
YEARS
SO
ID
APPRECIATE
ANY
HINTS
ON
WHAT
WILL
KEEP
THE
ORGANIZATION
IN
BUSINESS
THAT
LONG
AND
PREFERABLY
LONGER
OF
COURSE
AND
