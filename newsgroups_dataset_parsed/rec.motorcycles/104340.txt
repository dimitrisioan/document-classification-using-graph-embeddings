the
nice
thing
about
horses
though
is
that
if
they
break
down
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
you
can
eat
them
and
theyre
rather
tasty
fuels
a
bit
cheaper
too
per
gallon
bushel
perhaps
unfortunately
they
eat
the
same
amount
every
day
no
matter
how
much
you
ride
them
and
if
you
dont
fuel
them
they
die
on
an
annual
basis
i
spend
much
less
on
bike
stuff
than
amy

wonder

stuff

week
