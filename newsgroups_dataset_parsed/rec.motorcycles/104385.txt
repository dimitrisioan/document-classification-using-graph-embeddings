WRITES
HI
I
AM
CONSIDERING
THE
PURCHASE
OF
A
HONDA
INTERCEPTOR
FOR
CDN
ABOUT
US
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
MILEAGE
ON
THIS
BIKE
BUT
FROM
THE
PICTURE
IN
THE
RV
TRADER
MAGAZINE
IT
LOOKS
TO
BE
IN
GOOD
SHAPE
CAN
ANYBODY
ENLIGHTEN
ME
AS
TO
WHETHER
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
PURCHASE
IS
IT
A
GOOD
BIKE
THIS
WILL
BE
MY
FIRST
BIKE
I
REALIZE
THAT
FOR
A
BEGINNER
IS
CONSIDERED
TOO
BE
A
BIT
TOO
MUCH
BIKE
I
HAVE
HEARD
FROM
FRIENDS
THAT
WERE
ONCE
BEGINNERS
THAT
IF
THEY
HAD
TO
START
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
STARTED
WITH
A
BIGGER
BIKE
ONE
JUST
HAS
TO
BE
CAREFUL
AND
NOT
DRIVE
OUTSIDE
THEIR
SKILL
LEVEL
I
HAD
CONSIDERED
AND
POSTED
ABOUT
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
THE
PURCHASE
OF
YAMAHA
SECA
TURBO
WITH
KM
BUT
I
AM
A
LITTLE
WARY
NOW
ABOUT
THE
PROSPECT
OF
HAVING
TO
DEAL
WITH
A
TURBO
BOTH
ON
THE
ROAD
AND
IN
THE
SHOP
I
MAY
STILL
CONSIDER
THIS
BIKE
THE
PRICE
DROPPED
FROM
TO
CDN
BUT
THE
HONDA
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
GOOD
BIKE
COMMENTS
ONE
WORD
HEAVY
IT
STEERS
HEAVY
TURNS
REQUIRE
ALOT
OF
EFFORT
HARD
TO
GET
ACCESS
TO
THE
LARGE
MOTOR
WEAKSMALL
FRONT
FORKS
WITH
ANTIDIVE
GIZMOS
