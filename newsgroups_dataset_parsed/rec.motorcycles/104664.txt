I
NEED
SOME
ADVICE
ON
HAVING
SOMEONE
RIDE
PILLION
WITH
ME
ON
MY
NINJA
THIS
WILL
BE
THE
THE
FIRST
TIME
IVE
TAKEN

SLOW
DOWN
AND
HOLLER
BACK
EVERY
ONCE
IN
A
WHILE
AT
REASONABLE
SPEEDS
EVEN
ON
MY
UNDERMUFFLED
MAGNA
WE
CAN
HEAR
EACH
OTHER
ITS
ONLY
ABOVE
SAY
MPH
THAT
YOU
CANT
REALLY
COMMUNICATE
BALANCE
NEW
PASSENGERS
ARE
A
REAL
PAIN
BECAUSE
YOU
NEVER
KNOW
HOW
THEYRE
GOING
TO
REACT
TO
STEERING
SOME
PEOPLE
CATCH
ON
IMMEDIATELY
AND
LEAN
WITH
ME
OTHERS
ARE
COMPLETELY
SKITTISH
ABOUT
THE
LEANING
THING
AND
KEEP
THEIR
BODIES
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
HORIZON
THIS
IS
A
PAIN
WHILE
TURNING
BUT
MANAGEABLE
THE
WORST
ARE
THE
PASSENGERS
WHO
STAY
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
HORIZON
THEN
REMEMBER
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
A
TURN
AND
WHIP
AROUND
UNTIL
THEYRE
IN
THE
CORRECT
POSITION
THIS
ALWAYS
SCREWS
UP

TRACTION
WERE

OVER
MANY
FIRSTTIME
RIDERS
ARE
SURPRISED
BY
HOW
TIGHTLY
YOU
CAN
TURN
TURN
DYNAMICS
SIT
SO
THAT
YOU
FEEL
LIKE
YOURE
SITTING
UPRIGHT
AND
WERE
GOING
STRAIGHT
TRUST
YOUR
BUTT
NOT
YOUR
EYES
IF
YOURE
CONFUSED
CLOSE
YOUR
EYES
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
TURNS
TO
GET
THE
FEEL
OF
IT
OR
JUST
HUG
ME
TIGHT
PLEASE
NO
SUDDEN
MOVES
SHIFT
YOUR

AS
DESIRED
BUT
BE
GRADUAL
SO
I
CAN
COMPENSATE
YOUR
FACEPLATE
IS
YOURS
TO
OPENCLOSE
AS
DESIRED
TRUST
IS
ESSENTIAL
TRUST
THE
DRIVER
ME
TO
DO
THE
RIGHT
THING
IVE
DRIVEN
MANY
MILES
ON
THIS
THING
AND
KNOW
HOW
TO
OPERATE
IT
ENJOY
THE
RIDE
THIS
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
STRESS
FOR
EXAMPLE
ONE
OF
MY
FIRSTTIME
PASSWNGERS
SEEMED
TO
WATCH
THE
SPEEDO
LIKE
A
HAWK
I
DROVE
HER
TO
THE
BEACH
DOWN
AND
WHEVER
WE
TOPPED
MPH
SHED
HOLLER
SLOW
DOWN
IM
SCARED
I
HUMORED
HER
FOR
A
WHILE
THEN
SIMPLY
COVERED
THE
SPEEDOMETER
WITH
THE
SPARE
PIECE
OF
DUCT
TAPE
I
KEEP
STUCK
TO
THE
TOP
OF
THE
CLUSTER
PROBLEM
SOLVED
SHE
WATCHED
THE
SCENERY
INSTEAD
OF
THE
INSTRUMENTS
AND
HAD
A
MUCH
BETTER
TIME
BASED
ON
HER
EXPERIENCE
DRIVING
A
LINCOLN
CONTINENTAL
SHE
WAS
UNWILLING
TO
TRUST
MY
ABILITY
TO
CHOOSE
A
SAFE
SPEED
FOR
THE
BIKE
USUALLY
ILL
POINT
OUT
THE
CONTROLS
ENGINE
TRANSMISSION
BRAKES
TIRES
ETC
AND
DISCUSS
MOTORCYCLE
PHYSICS
A
BIT
TOO
FOR
FIRSTTIMERS
HELPS
CALM
THEIR
NERVES
AND
GIVES
THE
BIKE
A
CHANCE
TO
WARM
UP
WATCH
OUT
FOR
GRAVEL
ON
THE
MT
HAMILTON
ROAD
THERE
WERE
LOTS
OF
LITTLE
MUDSLIDES
AFTER
THE
LAST
BIG
RAIN
BY
NOW
MANY
OF
THE
BLIND
CORNERS
WILL
BE
NICELY
COVERED
WITH
A
CARPET
OF
LITTLE
ROUND
NEARLY
INVISIBLE
STONES
IT
DOESNT
HELP
BUILD
TRUST
WHEN
YOU
SLIDE
OUT
ON
A
BLIND
CORNER
ON
THE
FIRST
TRIP
