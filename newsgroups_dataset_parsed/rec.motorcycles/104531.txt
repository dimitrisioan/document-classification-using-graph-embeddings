AN

WHERE
I
USED
TO
LIVE
TRIED
THIS
ONLY
THEY
PUT
THE
THING
OVER
THE
DRIVERS
WINDOW
SO
THEY
COULDNT
MISS
IT
A
FRIEND
DAMNED
NEAR
WRECKED
ON
THE
WAY
HOME
ONE
NIGHT
HER
VISION
BLOCKED
BY
THE
STICKER
I
SUGGESTED
TO
THE
MANAGER
THE
ENORMOUS
LIABILITY
THEY
WERE
ASSUMING
BY
PULLING
THAT
STUNT
SHE
CLAIMED
IT
WAS
THE
DRIVER
WHO
WAS
AT
FAULT
FOR
ILLEGALLY
PARKING
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THAT
WOULD
PROBABLY
BE
GOOD
FOR
A
LAUGH
OR
TWO
IN
COURT
BEFORE
THEY
FOUND
HER
LIABLE
FOR
SERIOUS
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
DRIVER
WAS
DRIVING
THE
VEHICLE
VISUALLY
IMPAIRED
ISNT
THAT
LIKE
NOT
SCRAPING
ICE
AND
SNOW
OFF
YOUR
WINDSHIELD
AND
SUCH
SAY
THATS
ANOTHER
THING
THAT
BUGS
ME
WHY
DONT
PEOPLE
SCRAPE
THEIR
DAMN
WINDOWS
IVE
SEEN

DRIVING
CARS
WITH
BARELY
THE
DRIVERS
HALF
OF
THE
WINDSHIELD
CLEARED
NOTHING
ELSE
CLEARED
THIS
SEEMS
PRETTY
STUPID
AND
ISNT
THERE
SOMETHING
PROBABLY
VARIES

THAT
SAYS
