CAGERS
THIS
MORNING
A
TRUCK
THAT
HAD
BEEN
WITHIN
MY
SIGHT
AND
I
WITHIN
HIS
FOR
ABOUT
MILES
SUDDENLY
FORGOT
THAT
I
EXISTED
AND
PULLED
OVER
RIGHT
ON
ME
MY
FRONT
WHEEL
WAS
ABOUT
EVEN
WITH
THE
BACK
EDGE
OF
HIS
FRONT
PASSENGER
DOOR
AS
I
WAS
ACCELERATING
PAST
HIM
IT
WAS
TRIVIAL
ENOUGH
FOR
ME
TO
TAP
THE
BRAKES
AND
SLIDE
BEHIND
HIM
AS
HE
SLEWED
OVER
WITH
NO
SIGNAL
OF
COURSE
ON
TOP
OF
ME
WITH
MY
LITTLE
HORN
BLARING
DAMN
I
NEED
FIAMMS
BUT
THE
SATISFACTION
OF
BEING
AWARE
OF
MY
SURROUNDINGS
AND
THUS
SURVIVING
WAS
NOT
ENOUGH
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
I
LATER
PULLED
UP
ALONGSIDE
THE
BASTARD
AND
HE
MADE
NO
APOLOGETIC
WAVE
OR
ANYTHING
IS
THERE
SOME
WAY
THAT
I
CAN
MEMORIZE
THE
LICENSE
PLATE
OF
AN
OFFENDING
VEHICLE
AND
GET
THE
NAME
AND
ADDRESS
OF
THE
OWNER
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
FIREBOMB
HOUSES
OR
ANYTHING
ID
JUST
LIKE
TO
WRITE
A
CONSCIOUSNESSRAISING
LETTER
OR
TWO
I
THINK
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
GOOD
FOR
BDI
CAGERS
TO
KNOW
THAT
WE
KNOW
WHERE
THEY
LIVE
