I
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
THEORETICALLY
STOP
SO
FAR
BEHIND
A
CAR
BUT
CAN
YOU
REALLY
IN
ACTUALITY
AVOID
SUCH
AN
INCIDENT
SUGGESTIONS
IF
YOU
HAD
BEEN
LOOKING
IN
YOUR
MIRROR
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
SEEN
THE
GUY
COMING
BEFORE
YOU
HEARD
THE
SCREECHING
TIRES
WHEN
YOURE
STOPPED
AT
A
LIGHT
STOP
SO
THAT
YOURE
GOT
SPACE
IN
FRONT
OF
YOU
AND
A
QUICK
EASY
ESCAPE
ROUTE
BETWEEN
LANES
INTO
A
CROSSWALK
UP
A
DRIVEWAY
SOMEWHERE
IF
SOMEONE
DECIDES
THEY
WANT
TO
PLOW
INTO
YOU
KEEP
THE
BIKE
IN
FIRST
WITH
THE
CLUTCH
IN
UNTIL
AT
LEAST
A
COUPLE
OF
CARS
ARE
STOPPED
BEHIND
YOU
SO
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
WASTE
A
SECOND
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TRYING
TO
GET
IT
IN
GEAR
IF
YOU
NEED
TO
MOVE
WATCH
YOUR
MIRRORS
IN
THAT
SITUATION
MOST
OF
THE
HAZARDS
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
AVOID
ARE
COMING
FROM
BEHIND
YOU
SIPDE
MSFGEEKSPEAK
ISNT
JUST
FOR
WHEN
YOURE
MOVING
AND
YOURE
LESS
LIKELY
TO
PANIC
AND
STALL
THE
BIKE
IF
YOUVE
GOT
TIME
TO
PREPARE
BEFORE
THE
GUYS
TIRES
LOCK
UP
BEHIND
YOU
YOU
STILL
GET
THE
BEJEEZUS
SCARED
OUT
OF
YOU

ITS
MORE
