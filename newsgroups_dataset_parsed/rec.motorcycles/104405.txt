this
applies
you
basically
insure
your
own
vehicle
and
the
max
you
can
sue
for
is
about
in
mi
anyway
the
point
to
be
made
with
nofault
is
the
fact
that
it
removes
the
lawyers
from
the
system
and
lets
people
get
their
money
faster
the
removal
of
lawyers
reduces
the
clogs
on
court
system
and
thus
reduces
government
burdens
by
not
requiring
so
many
judges
does
it
work
i
dont
know
ask
the
people
of
michigan
no
ask
the
people
of
new
jersey
where
the
nofault
hoax
has
been
going
on
for
years
last
i
heard
every
state
that
ever
got
nofault
insurance
saw
an
increase
in
rates
i
know
thats
what
happened
in
nj
because
i
lived
there
when
it
changed
just
one
more
reason
i
will
never
go
back
to
that
