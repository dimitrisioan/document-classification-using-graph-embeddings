RE
WHY
I
WONT
BE
GETTING
MY
LOW
RIDER
THIS
YEAR

PETER
AHRENS
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
CHARLESAROGERS
WRITES
I
HAD
PLANNED
TO
GET
AN
HD
THIS
YEARBUT
INSTEAD
I
TOOK
DELIVERY
ON
A
BRAND
NEW
MALE
OFFSPRINGER
LAST
MONDAY
SOUNDS
LIKE
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
YOUR
PLANNING
LAST
YEAR
GIVEN
HARLEYDAVIDSONS
PRODUCT
DELIVERY
LAG
AND
THE
HUMAN
GESTATION
CYCLE
OR
PERHAPS
ANY
PLANNING
AT
ALL
HIYA
PETE
STILL
GOT
THAT
CBX
NICE
TO
HEAR
FROM
YOU
AGAIN
AND
YES
I
FINALLY
DID
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
THIS
HAPPENS
AND
I
HAVE
TAKEN
STEPS
TO
ENSURE
A
STORKISH
REPETITION
THAT
WOULD
BE
LOW
DRAG
BARS
AND
WAY
RAD
REARSETS
FOR
THE
FJ
SO
THAT
THE
ERGONOMIC
CONSTRAINTS
WOULD
HAVE
CONTRACEPTIVE
CONSEQUENCES
OUCH
THIS
BRINGS
TO
MIND
ONE
OF
THE
RECOMMENDATIONS
IN
THE
HURT
STUDY
BECAUSE
THE
REAR
OF
THE
GAS
TANK
IS
IN
CLOSE
PROXIMITY
TO
HIGHLY
PRIZED
AND
EASILY
DAMAGED
ANATOMY
HURT
ET
AL
RECOMMENDED
THAT
MANUFACTURERS
BUILD
THE
TANK
SO
AS
TO
REDUCE
THE
ER
STEP
FUNCTION
PROVIDED
WHEN
THE
RIDERS
BODY
SLIDES
OFF
OF
THE
SEAT
AND
ONTO
THE
GAS
TANK
IN
THE
UNFORTUNATE
EVENT
THAT
THE
BIKE
STOPS
SUDDENLY
AND
THE
RIDER
DOESNT
I
THINK
ITS
REALLY
INSPIRING
HOW
THE
MANUFACTURERS
HAVE
TAKEN
THIS
ADVICE
TO
HEART
IN
THEIR
DESIGN
OF
BIKES
LIKE
THE
AND
THE
CHUCK
ROGERS
