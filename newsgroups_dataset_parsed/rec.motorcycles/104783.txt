HEY
WHAT
THE
HELL
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
THAT
YOU
SUCK
I
HAVE
A
GODGIVEN
RIGHT
TO
EXPRESS
OPINIONS
CARRY
A
GUN
AND
TO
NOT
WEAR
A
HELMET
GODDAMN
IT
EVERYTHING
YOU
STAND
FOR
IS
STUPID
ID
GIVE
IT
AN
ON
A
SCALE
OF
WHILE
NOT
MENTIONING
HITLER
OR
KORESH
WEIGHS
IN
YOUR
FAVOR
YOU
ALSO
NEGLECTED
TO
MENTION
MPH
TENNIS
BALLS
LITTLE
GIRLS
AND
COUNTERSTEERING
ANOTHER
THING
TO
CONSIDER
IS
THAT
LIKE
MEXICAN

A
LOT
OF
FOLKS
MISTAKE
HEAT

QUALITY
SUBTLE

AND
INTRODUCING
A
NEW
POLYSYLLABIC
WORD
STRABISMIC
FOR
EXAMPLE
IS
LIKELY
TO
INSURE
THAT
SOME
SMALL
PART
OF
YOUR
FLAME
WILL
BECOME
IMMORTAL

THE
SERIOUS
OVERREACTION
OUGHT
TO
BE
WORTH
A
COUPLE
OF
POINTS
NOT
TO
MENTION
THE
BIT
CONDEMNING
EVERTHING
THE
FLAMEE
MIGHT
EVER
SAY
THE
NON
SEQUITUR
ABOUT
GUNS
AND
HELMETS
IS
JUST
THE
PROPER
FLOURISH
I
PERSONALLY
AM
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
TYPES
OF
GOOD
FLAMES
THE
FIRST
DOES
TRADE
QUALITY
IN
THE
SENSE
YOU
MENTION
FOR
HEAT
THIS
HAS
A
CERTAIN
SURPRISE
VALUE
AND
IF
DONE
CORRECTLY
WHICH
I
CONTEND
WAS
DONE
ABOVE
IS
REASONABLY
ENTERTAINING
WHILE
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
THE
FLAME
I
POSTED
DOES
NOT
MENTION
ANYONES
HABITUAL
VELOCITY
FRIENDS
DINNER
OR
ENTERTAINMENT
IT
SAYS
WHAT
IT
NEEDS
TO
WITH
THE
APPROPRIATE
FLAIR
AND
IT
IS
SHORT
THE
WEAKNESS
OF
THIS
TYPE
OF
FLAME
IS
ACTUALLY
THAT
IT
CAN
EASILY
BE
TAKEN
TOO
FAR
AT
WHICH
POINT
IT
BECOMES
TRITE
AND
BORING
WITNESS
THE
INFANTE
THREAD
RECENTLY
THE
OTHER
TYPE
OF
FLAME
WHICH
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
GLORIFYING
ABOVE
HAS
A
FEW
WEAKNESSES
AS
WELL
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IT
CAN
GET
VERBOSE
AND
TEDIOUS
IN
THE
EXTREME
PARTICULARLY
IF
THE
READER
DOES
NOT
ALREADY
STRONGLY
IDENTIFY
WITH
ONE
SIDE
OR
THE
OTHER
IN
THE
SECOND
DISCUSSING
SOMEONES
PERSONAL
QUALITIES
HABITS
AND
SO
FORTH
CAN
QUICKLY
BECOME
LIBELOUS
OR
IS
THAT
SLANDEROUS
I
CAN
NEVER
REMEMBER
THE
DIFFERENCE
THIS
LEADS
TO
A
PROLIFERATION
OF
LAWYERS
WHICH
IS
WIDELY
REGARDED
AS
A
BAD
THING
FINALLY
INTRODUCING
POLYSYLLABIC
WORDS
IS
PROBLEMATIC
I
CANT
HAUL
MY
BIG
DIC
AROUND
ON
MY
BIKE
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
BAD
FORM
TO
USE
A
WORD
WHICH
ACTUALLY
TURNED
OUT
TO
HAVE
A
MEANING
ESPECIALLY
ONE
WHICH
RAN
COUNTER
TO
MY
USE
AND
FLAMAGE
IN
GENERAL
IN
SUMMARY
BLAINE
YOUR
SCORE
FOR
THAT
FLAME
IS
INCORRECT
WHILE
IT
MAY
BE
THE
WUNDERFLAME
THE
WEAKNESSES
YOU
POINT
OUT
ARE
NOT
NECESSARILY
WEAKNESSES
AND
YOUR
SUGGESTED
CORRECTIONS
ARE
NOT
ALWAYS
USEFUL
NOR
APPLICABLE
YOU
ALSO
PROBABLY
COULDNT
OUTRUN
A
TENNIS
BALL
WITH
A
FLATULENT
DOG
STAPLED
TO
YOUR
POSTERIOR
AND
ILL
BET
YOU
AND
YOUR
MOTORCYCLE
LEAN
TO
THE
OUTSIDE
WHILE
TURNING
THE
SAME
