RE
DOGS
VS
BIKES
MY
FIRST
ENCOUNTER
WITH
A
DOG
CHASING
AFTER
MY
BIKE
WAS
ON
MY
FIRST
POKER
RUN
A
BIG
GERMAN
SHEPARD
RAN
OUT
INTO
THE
PACK
OF
BIKES
I
WAS
RIDING
WITH
AND
TRIED
TO
BITE
THE
RIGHT
LEG
OF
THE
GUY
RIDING
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
HE
KICKED
THE
DOG
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
WE
WERE
ALL
ONLY
GOING
ABOUT
AND
JUST
MADE
THE
DOG
ANGRIER
AND
GOT
AWAY
BY
APPLYING
WFO
AND
OUTRUNNING
THE
DOG
WHO
THEN
STARTED
AFTER
YOURS
TRULY
AT
THE
TIME
I
HAD
OPEN
DRAG
PIPES
OBNOXIOUSLY
LOUD
AS
HELL
AND
AS
SOON
AS
THE
DOG
WAS
ABOUT
FEET
AWAY
FROM
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
OF
MY
BIKE
I
PULLED
IN
THE
CLUTCH
AND
REVVED
THE
MOTOR
UP
TO
ABOUT
AND
THE
ROAR
OF
THE
PIPES
FRIGHTENED
THE
DOG
AWAY
PROBABLY
MADE
THE
DOGS
EARS
HURT
LIKE
HELL
AND
HE
DIDNT
COME
BACK
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
BIKERS
BEHIND
ME
EITHER
MY
SECOND
ENCOUNTER
WAS
WITH
AN
ALREADY
DECEASED
ROADKILL
DOG
I
WASNT
PAYING
VERY
CLOSE
ATTENTION
TO
THE
PAVEMENT
WHEN
THE
CAR
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
STRADDLED
THE
CARCASS
I
LOOKED
DOWN
JUST
IN
TIME
TO
SEE
WHAT
I
WAS
ABOUT
TO
RUN
OVER
SO
I
JUST
HELD
ONTO
THE
HANDLEBARS
AND
FREAKED
OUT
BOTH
WHEELS
WENT
SQUARELY
OVER
THE
DOGS
BELLY
WITH
A
THUMPTHUMP
JUST
LIKE
RUNNING
OVER
A
PIECE
OF
A
LUMBER
THE
BIKE
DIDNT
LOSE
ANY
STABILITY
AT
ALL
AND
I
KEPT
ON
GOING
AFTER
I
GOT
TO
MY
DESTINATION
I
FOUND
BITS
OF
FUR
MEAT
AND
BLOOD
STUCK
TO
THE
BOTTOM
OF
MY
MOTOR
