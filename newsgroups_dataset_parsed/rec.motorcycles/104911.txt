do
you
decide
that
it
is
too
windy
to
ride
when
the
bugs
are
splatting
on
the
side
of
my
helmet
instead
of
the
faceshield
when
semis
are
on
their
side
in
the
downwind
ditch
when
i
cant
see
the
road
for
all
the
tumbleweeds
rolling
past
when
the
airborne
sandgravel
is
sandblasting
my
paint
job
when
all
of
the
above
is
happening
at
once
in
the
middle
of
wonderful
wyldoming
well
it
was
gusting
to
mph
