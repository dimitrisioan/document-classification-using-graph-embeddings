the
only

seem

acting
smug
now
probably
have
chain
final
drive
which
as
we
all
know
is
less
efficient
and
has
higher
maintenance
and
probably
didnt
know
the
answer
at
the
start
of
the
thread
when
did
you
go
out
and
change
the
laws
of
physics
according
to
some
numbers
i
used
to
see
bandied
around
shaft
drive
is
on
the
order
of
efficient
while
chain
drive
is
closer
to
seems
to
me
that
this
makes
chain
drive
more
efficient
hmmmmm
and
granted
shaft
has
a
lot
less
maintenance
which
is
fine
if
you
dont
mind
less
performance

ok
and
you
regularly
ride
your
bike
to
within
of
its
maximum
capability
note
any
idiot
can
go
flat
out
on
a
bike
most
of
them
do
anyway
efficient
at
what
a
shaft
drive
is
a
much
more
efficient
solid
erect
lump
of
metal
than
a
floppy
flaccid
unsatisfying
chain
