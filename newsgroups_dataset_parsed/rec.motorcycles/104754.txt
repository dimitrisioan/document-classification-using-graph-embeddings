RE
I
NEED
YOUR
ADVICE
IM
A
NEW
RIDER
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
WELL
IF
I
WERE
TO
DO
THAT
I
WOULD
NEVER
BE
GOING
OVER
MPH
EVEN
IN
GEAR
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
WILL
IT
HURT
MY
NEW
CYCLE

IN
THE
RPM
RANGE
SO
THAT
I
CAN
AT
LEAST
GO
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
I
HAD
THE
SAME
INCONVENIENCE
WHEN
I
BOUGHT
MY
ONLY
I
COULD
AT
LEAST
GO
MPH
DURING
THE
INITIAL
BREAKIN
DESPITE
THE
HIGH
QUALITY
OF
MOTOR
OILS
AND
MOTORCYCLE
ENGINES

DAYS
I
WOULD
FOLLOW
THE
INSTRUCTIONS

JUST
KEEP
TO

RIDING
FOR
THE
FIRST
MILES
HECK
THOSE
MILES
GO
BY
FAST
AND
ITS
WORTH
IT
TO
KNOW
YOU
HAVENT
POSSIBLY
SCREWED
UP
YOUR
ENGINE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THIS
HAS
ALL
THE
MAKINGS
OF
A
THREAD
DEBATING
