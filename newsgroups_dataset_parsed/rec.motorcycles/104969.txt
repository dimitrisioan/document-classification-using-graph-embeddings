can
anyone
who
has
handson
experience
on
riding
the
yamaha
vmax
pls
kindly
comment
on
its
handling
some
guy
came
to
the
omrra
race
school
last
weekend
with
number
plates
on
his
vmax
he
didnt
get
more
than
practice
laps
in
before
he
pushed
the
frame
too
hard
and
it
drove
him
into
the
guard
rail
on
the
back
straight
portland
international
raceway
is
now
on
vmaxes
vmax
handling
ferget
it
btw
the
rider
was
conscious
and
semicoherent
when
the
ambulance
carted
him
off
thats
all
i
know
i
hate
to
pick
on
someone
who
may
have
been
seriously
injured
lets
hope
not
but
semicoherent
sounds
like
a
good
description
of
someone
who
shows
up
at
the
track
w
a
vmax
in
the
first
place

is
like
a
herd
of
performing
elephants
with
diarrhea
massive
difficult
to
redirect
aweinspiring
entertaining
and
a
source
of
mind
boggling
amounts
of
excrement
when
you
least
expect
