they
way
i
want
it
to
however
i
have
the
following
problem
my
chin
hangs
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
helmet
i
am
curious
to
know
whether
i
would
still
have
this
problem
if
i
were
to
switch
to
the
extra
large
size
in
particular
can
anyone
tell
me
for
certain
if
the
outer
shell
of
the
arai
quantums
in
size
xlarge
is
any
different
largerrounderetc
than
the
same
helmet
in
size
large
or
if
the
inner
paddingfoam
on
the
xlarge
is
such
that
ones
head
fits
a
little
deeper
in
the
helmet
and
thus
ones
chin
would
not
stick
out
this
is
true
for
the
very
old
arthurfulmer
helmets
that
i
have
namely
my
chin
hangs
out
a
little
from
the
bottom
of
the
large
helmet
and
not
at
all
from
the
xlarge
but
the
xlarge
is
not
as
snug
as
the
large
the
dealer
is
willing
to
replace
the
helmet
at
no
additional
cost
ie
shipping
but
i
want
to
make
sure
that
the
xlarge
is
in
fact
a
little
bigger
or
linered
such
that
my
chin
will
not
hang
out
and
how
much
looser
will
my
head
fit
in
the
xlarge
if
anyone
has
recent
experience
with
this
helmet
please
let
me
hear
email
from
you
asap
thank
you
so
much
amir
im
not
sure
about
the
helmet

chin
