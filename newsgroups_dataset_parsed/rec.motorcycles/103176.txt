THE
FOLLOWING
PROBLEM
MY
CHIN
HANGS
OUT
FROM
THE
BOTTOM

I
AM
CURIOUS

KNOW
WHETHER
I

STILL
HAVE
THIS
PROBLEM
IF
I
WERE

SWITCH
TO
THE
EXTRA
LARGE
SIZE
IN
PARTICULAR

THE
ARAI
QUANTUMS
IN
SIZE
XLARGE

ANY
DIFFERENT
LARGERROUNDERETC
THAN
THE
SAME
HELMET

SIZE
LARGE

IF
THE
INNER
PADDINGFOAM
ON

XLARGE
IS
SUCH
THAT
ONES
HEAD
FITS
A
LITTLE
DEEPER
IN
THE
HELMET

THUS
ONES
CHIN

NOT
STICK

IS
TRUE
FOR
THE
VERY
OLD
ARTHURFULMER
HELMETS

I
HAVE
NAMELY
MY
CHIN
HANGS
OUT
A
LITTLE
FROM
THE

OF
THE
LARGE
HELMET
AND
NOT
AT

FROM
THE
XLARGE

THE
XLARGE
IS
NOT
AS
SNUG
AS
THE
LARGE
THE
DEALER
IS
WILLING
TO
REPLACE
THE
HELMET
AT
NO
ADDITIONAL
COST
IE
SHIPPING
BUT
I
WANT
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
THE
XLARGE
IS
IN
FACT
A
LITTLE
BIGGER
OR
LINERED
SUCH
THAT
MY
CHIN
WILL
NOT
HANG
OUT

MUCH
LOOSER
WILL
MY
HEAD
FIT
IN
THE
XLARGE

RECENT
