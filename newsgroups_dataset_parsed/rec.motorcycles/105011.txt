if
this
is
the
same
as
adjusting
the
shims
between
cam
and
valve
i
have
the
same
question
do
you
buy
a
full
set
of
shims
before
starting
the
adjustment
process
or
do
you
calculate
the
shims
you
need
and
then
run
off
to
the
dealer
in
the
cage
to
see
if
the
right
shims
are
in
stock
obviously
the
latter
would
be
cheaper
what
do
shims
cost
but
are
measurements
of
the
shim
need
reliable
enough
to
buy
only
the
indicated
shims
only
buy
what
you
need
it
would
cost
a
lot
to
buy
a
full
set
and
you
wont
ever
use
most
of
them
i
have
had
good
luck
with
the
calculation
method
i
have
never
had
to
change
more
than
one
size
increment
at
a
time
i
never
needed
a
change
larger
than
the
next
size
