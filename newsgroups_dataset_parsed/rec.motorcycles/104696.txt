CHARLES
PARR
WRITES
SHEESH
EVEN
A
TRAINED
ATTACK
DOG
IS
NO
MATCH
FOR
A
HUMAN
WE
HAVE
ALL
THE
ADVANTAGES
I
AGREE
WITH
THIS
AFTER
ALL
WHEN
YOU
GRAB
UNDER
HIS
CHIN
AND
ARE
CAREFUL
TO
KEEP
YOUR
HANDS
AWAY
FROM
HIS
TWISTING
HEAD
WHAT
IS
HE
GOING
TO
DO
TAILWAG
YOU
TO
DEATH
I
EVEN
HAD
ONE
OCCASION
WHERE
I
WAS
UNEXPECTEDLY
JUMPED
BY
A
LB
GERMAN
SHEPHERD
AND
GRABBED
HIS
UPPER
JAW
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
HIS
LOWER
JAW
IN
THE
OTHER
NOW
IM
HOLDING
HIS
MOUTH
OPEN
NO
WAY
IS
HE
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
CLAMP
DOWN
AND
HE
CAN
DO
NOTHING
HOWEVER
ALL
THIS
MACHO
SHIT
ASIDE
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
ARE
RIDING
A
BIKE
AND
A
DOG
IS
ARROWING
TO
INTERCEPT
IT
MAY
BE
UNWISE
FOR
YOU
TO
STOP
AND
TRY
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
DOG
FOR
THE
SIMPLE
FACT
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
THROUGH
YOUR
LEATHERS
AND
WORKING
ON
YOUR
JEANS
BEFORE
YOU
CAN
DISMOUNT
AND
DEAL
WITH
IT
PROPERLY
BY
ALL
MEANS
IF
YOU
DO
KICK
THE
DOG
OR
OTHERWISE
GET
ITS
ATTENTION
STOP
AND
STAY
THERE
IF
YOU
KICK
THE
DOG
AND
RIDE
AWAY
THAT
IS
A
VICTORY
FOR
THE
DOG
IT
DROVE
YOU
OUT
OF
ITS
TERRITORY
IT
IS
NOT
EVEN
A
QUALIFIED
VICTORY
IT
IS
A
VICTORY
IF
YOU
KICK
IT
AND
STOP
AND
SIT
THERE
OF
DOGS
WILL
SAY
OH
SHIT
THIS
GUYS
SERIOUS
AND
BACK
OFF
NOW
YOU
HAVE
ESTABLISHED
YOUR
DOMINANCE
OVER
THE
DOG
AND
IT
PROBABLY
WILL
NOT
BOTHER
YOU
AGAIN
LLAMAS
HOWEVER
ARE
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
IF
YOU
STOP
NEAR
A
LLAMA
IT
WILL
JUST
HOP
ON
AND
INSIST
ON
A
RIDE
AND
THATS
IF
YOURE
LUCKY
IF
IT
DOESNT
LIKE
YOU
ITLL
BARF
YOU
OFF
THE
BIKE
AND
STEAL
