sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
as
far
as
the
internet
goes
i
was
in
baghdad
while
you
were
still
in
your
dads
bag
is
this
bit
funny
most
of
the
people
who
made
this
group
interesting
or
years
ago
are
no
longer
around
and
i
only
have
time
to
make
a
random
sweep
once
a
week
or
so
hence
i
missed
most
of
this
thread
im
terribly
sorry
based
on
your
previous
postings
apparently
devoid
of
humour
sarcasm
wit
or
the
apparent
capacity
to
walk
and

i
assumed
you
were

mea

i
know
i
know
subtlety
is
sort
of

isnt
it
still
its
nice
to
see
that
bnr
are
doing
so
well
that
they
can
afford
to
overpay
some
contractors
to
sit
and
read
news
all
day
thats
foreign
firms
for
you
and
a
touchy
newbie
at
that
whats
