how
do
you
know
what
kind
of
gas
to
buy
depending
on
the
compression
ratio
of
your
engine
i
heard
ok
but
what
kind
of
gas
goes
for
what
kind
of
compression
im
asking
this
because
i
used
to
put
in
my
hawk
gt
and
the
other
day
i
changed
because
i
wanted
to
see
if
there
was
a
difference
and
i
dont
know
if
im
being
subjective
or
what
but
it
seems
like
the
bike
runs
better
run
your
bike
on
the
lowest
octane
that
it
will
run
smoothly
on
higher
octane
fuel
is
not
better
than
lower
octane
gas
pick
up
the
last
american
roadracing
magazine
theres
a
short
article
in
there
about
octane
and
the
misconceptions
many
people
make
about
the
subject
look
at
your
owners
manual
i
believe
it
states
is
just
fine
