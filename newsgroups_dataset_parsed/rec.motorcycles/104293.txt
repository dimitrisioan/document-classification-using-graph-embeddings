SAYS
I
WAS
ATTACKED
BY
A
RABID
HUBCAP
ONCE
I
WAS
GOING
TO
WORK
ON
A
YAMAHA
TWIN
AKA
THE
VIBRATING
TANK
WHEN
I
HEARD
A
WIERD
NOISE
OFF
TO
MY
LEFT
I
CAUGHT
A
GLIMPSE
OF
SOMETHING
SILVER
HEADED
FOR
MY
LEFT
FOOT
AND
JERKED
IT
UP
ABOUT
A
NANOSECOND
BEFORE
MY
BIKE
WAS
HIT
HARD
IN
THE
LEFT
SIDE
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
PUT
MY
FOOT
BACK
ON
THE
PEG
I
FOUND
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
THERE
I
PULLED
INTO
THE
NEAREST
PARKING
LOT
AND
DISCOVERED
THAT
I
HAD
BEEN
HIT
BY
A
WIREWHEEL
TYPE
HUBCAP
FROM
A
LARGE
CAGE
THIS
HUBCAP
WEIGHED
ABOUT
POUNDS
THE
IMPACT
HAD
BENT
THE
LEFT
PEG
FLAT
AGAINST
THE
FRAME
AND
TWEEKED
THE
SHIFTER
IN
THE
PROCESS
HAD
I
NOT
HEARD
THE
APPROACHING
CAP
I
FEEL
CERTIAN
THAT
I
WOULD
BE
SANS
A
PORTION
OF
MY
LEFT
FOOT
HMMMMI
WONDERED
WHERE
THAT
HUBCAP
WENT
DOD
THE
SIGNIFICANT
PROBLEMS
WE
FACE
CANNOT
BE
SOLVED
AT
THE
SAME
LEVEL
OF
THINKING
WE
WERE
AT
WHEN
WE
CREATED
THEM

EINSTEIN

ETERNAL
