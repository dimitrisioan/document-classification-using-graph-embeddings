i
bought
it
i
tried
it
it
is
truly
the
miracle
spooge
my
chain
is
lubed
my
wheel
is
clean
after
id
try
it
on
the
vfr
but
goddamn
competition
accessories
hasnt
mailed
my
order
yet
hell
its
only
been
two
weeks
and
i
was
ordering
some
pretty
bizzare
stuff
like
a
clear
face
sheild
and
a
can
of
chain
wax
bastards
for
what
its
worth
i
got
my
can
in
three
days
from
chaparral
thats
ups
ground
from
ca
to
ut
ymmv
the
stuff
seems
to
work
and
it
doesnt
attract
grundge
like
blue
does
i
gave
it
the
acid
test
a
full
days
worth
of
breaking
in
the
quadracers
new
paddle
tires
down
at
the
sand
dunes
if
theres
anything
wet
stickey
it
will
be
coated
with
sand
at
the
end
of
the
day
but
the
chain
looked
pretty
clean
as
far
as
mailorder
goes
if
chaparral
has
it
in
stock
and
they
can
tell
you
if
its
in
stock
or
about
how
long
it
will
take
to
backorder
it
if
its
not
i
usually
get
it
in
three
days
competition
accessories
always
seems
to
take
a
week
or
two
to
deliver
motorcycle
accessory
warehouse
also
takes
a
week
or
two
and
after
trying
to
buy
some
boots
from
them
last
week
i
dont
think
they
actually
stock
anything
maw
was
about
cheaper
than
chaparral
on
alpinestars
tech
boots
but
on
monday
i
was
hoping
to
get
them
by
the
end
of
the
week
so
i
asked
maw
a
completely
unreasonable
question
do
you
have
them
in
stock
the
conversation
went
something
like
this
i
need
to
know
if
you
have
some
boots
in
stock
do
you
want
to
pay
with
visa
or
mastercard
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
them
in
stock
well
the
computer
doesnt
show
anything
id
have
to
call
the
distributer
to
find
out
if
we
have
them
so
do
you
have
them
or
not
dont
you
understand
what
im
saying
i
have
to
call
our
distributer
to
find
out
if
we
have
them
in
stock
or
not
uh
right
so
can
you
do
it
yea
call
me
back
in
an
hour
and
ask
for
phil
so
an
hour
later
phil
isnt
there
but
mike
says
hell
check
and
call
him
back
in
half
an
hour
half
an
hour
later
mike
isnt
there
either
but
he
left
a
note
that
says
theyll
have
them
by
the
end
of
the
month
weeks
away
screw
it
the
bucks
isnt
worth
the
hassle
i
called
chaparral
and
asked
if
they
had
them
in
stock
ooh
alpinestars
probably
not
they
are
hard
to
keep
in
stock
but
ill
check
what
size
size
lets
see
yes
size
in
blue
white
gray
white
black
ill
take
the
blacks
this
was
about
noon
on
monday
they
arrived
thursday
morning
once
again
three
days
via
ups
ground
i
like
chaparral
im
not
completely
down
on
maw
they
often
have
lower
prices
but
be
prepared
to
wait
oh
and
if
anyones
in
the
market
for
sand
tires
and
other
atv
stuff
scorcher
seems
like
a
good
outfit
friendly
fast
had
the
tires
i
wanted
in
stock
and
were
cheaper
than
chaparral
too
