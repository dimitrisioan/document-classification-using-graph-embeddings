i
am
in
the
market
for
a
bike
and
have
recently
found
a
honda
vrf
at
a
dealership
the
bike
has
about
miles
and
is
around
it
has
had
two
previous
owners
both
employees
of
the
dealership
who
i
have
been
told
took
very
good
care
of
the
bike
i
have
two
questions
is
this
too
many
miles
for
a
bike
i
know
this
would
not
be
many
miles
for
a
car
but
i
am
unfamiliar
with
the
life
span
of
bikes
is
this
a
decent
price
i
am
also
unfamilar
with
prices
for
used
bikes
is
there
a
blue
book
for
bikes
like
there
is
for
cars
thanks
for
any
advice
you
can
