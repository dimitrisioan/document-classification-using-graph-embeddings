riding
to
work
last
week
via
hwy
from
suisun
to
i
was
pulled
over
by
a
chp
black
and
white
by
the
gas
station
by
jameson
canyon
road
the
officer
stated
it
looked
like
you
were
going
kinda
fast
coming
down
highway
you
must
have
been
going
at
least
or
i
just
said
okay
and
did
not
agree
or
disagree
to
anything
he
said
can
you
beat
this
ticket
personally
i
think
its
your
duty
as
a
citizen
to
make
it
as
much
trouble
as
possible
for
them
so
maybe
theyll
give
up
and
leave
us
alone
someday
soon
right
on
it
is
every
citizens
right
and
duty
to
force
government
accountability
anecdotes
deleted
ive
never
tried
proving
the
cop
was
mistaken
i
did
get
to
see
some
other
poor
biker
try
it
he
was
mixing
up
various
facts
like
the
maximum
acceleration
of
a
cop
car
and
the
distance
at
which
the
cop
had
been
pacing
him
and
end
up
demonstrating
that
he
couldnt
possibly
have
been
going
as
fast
as
the
cop
had
suggested
hed
brought
diagrams
and
a
calculator
he
was
prepared
he
lost
keep
in
mind
cops
do
this
all
the
time
and
their
word
is
better
than
yours
also
keep
in
mind
that
cops
will
lie
in
court
to
get
their
way
dont
get
me
started
by
asking
how
i
know
if
you
decide
to
fight
you
have
to
be
ready
for
this
as
well
as
devise
strategy
to
make
the
cops
story
doubtful
in
the
judgejurys
mind
maybe
though
they
dont
guess
how
fast
bikes
are
going
all
the
time
besides
this
guy
didnt
speak
english
very
well
and
ended
up
absolutely
confounding
the
judge
the
cop
and
everyone
else
in
the
room
whod
been
recently
criminalized
by
some
twit
with
a
gun
and
a
quota
ahem
ok
im
better
now
maybe
hed
have
won
had
his
presentation
been
more
polished
maybe
not
he
did
get
