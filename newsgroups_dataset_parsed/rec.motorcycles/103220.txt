PERSONALLY
I
THINK
ITS
YOUR
DUTY
AS
A
CITIZEN
TO
MAKE
IT
AS

I
DID
GET
TO
SEE
SOME
OTHER
POOR
BIKER
TRY
IT
HE
WAS
MIXING
UP
VARIOUS
FACTS
LIKE
THE
MAXIMUM
ACCELERATION
OF
A
COP
CAR
AND
THE
DISTANCE
AT
WHICH
THE
COP
HAD
BEEN
PACING
HIM
AND
END
UP
DEMONSTRATING
THAT
HE
COULDNT
POSSIBLY
HAVE
BEEN
GOING
AS
FAST
AS
THE
COP
HAD
SUGGESTED
HED
BROUGHT
DIAGRAMS

A
