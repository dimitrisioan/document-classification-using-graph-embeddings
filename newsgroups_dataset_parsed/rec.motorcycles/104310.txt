i
tried
mailing
you
but
your
domain
seems
not
to
exist
cant
even
get
sinetslbcom
to
admit
to
knowing
about
geco
anyway
here
we
go
in
article
you
wrote
runs
like
a
bitch
anyone
have
a
cure
for
sub
zero
running
probs
on
a
gpz
anything
below
revs
and
the
bike
wants
to
cut
out
all
the
time
the
recommended
cure
in
the
bike
mags
seems
to
be
to
switch
off
the
engine
for
a
minute
to
thaw
the
icebut
this
is
obviously
not
mutch
of
a
cure
mine
has
had
the
kawasaki
heated
carb
mod
but
the
problem
persists
ive
covered
the
rad
which
makes
the
bike
run
warmer
and
moves
the
problem
down
the
temp
scale
a
degree
or
two
has
anyone
tried
a
dynojet
kit
on
the
or
getting
desperate
different
carbs
or
the
fuel
injection
off
the
gpz
have
you
talked
to
kawasaki
maybe
they
did
another
version
of
the
upgrade
kit
got
to
be
worth
a
phone
call
did
you
do
the
carb
mod
or
did
you
buy
it
secondhand
from
someone
who
said
that
it
had
been
done
is
that
orpington
in
kent
if
so
have
you
heard
of
the
ogri
mailing
list
which
i
run
its
an
email
list
for
bikers
in
the
uk
and
interested
parties
