THE
DIFFERENCE
OF
OPINION
AND
DIFFERENCE
IN
MOTORCYCLING
BETWEEN
THE
SPORTBIKE
RIDERS
AND
THE
CRUISERBIKE
RIDERS
THAT
DIFFERENCE
IS
ONLY
IN
THE
MINDS
OF
CERTAIN
CLOSEDMINDED
INDIVIDUALS
I
HAVE
HAD
THE
VERY
BEST
MOTORCYCLING
TIMES
WITH

QUITE
A

BETWEEN
THE
OPINIONS
OF
WHAT
MOTORCYCLING
IS
TO
DIFFERENT
INDIVIDUALS
YES

MOTORCYCLING

SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT

EVERY

IS
THE
NATURE
OF

ONE
OF
THE
BEAUTIES
OF
THE
SPORT
CRUISERBIKE

HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
VIEW
OF
MOTORCYCLING
THAN
THOSE
OF
SPORT
BIKE
RIDERS
WHAT
THEY
LIKE
AND
DISLIKE
ABOUT
MOTORCYCLING
THIS
IS
NOT
CLOSEDMINDED
AND
WHAT
VIEW
EXACTLY
IS
IT
THAT
EVERY
SINGLE
RIDER
OF
CRUISER
BIKES
HOLDS
A
VEIW
THAT
OF
COURSE
NO

RIDER
COULD
POSSIBLY
HOLD
