sheesh
even
a
trained
attack
dog
is
no
match
for
a
human
we
have
all
the
advantages
i
agree
with
this
me
too
for
chihuahuas
the
police
and
the
military
dont
train
dobermans
and
shephards
and
use
them
as
weapons
because
they
are
so
easy
for
the
average
joe
to
defeat
barehanded
you
may
have
opposing
thumbs
but
the
dog
has
teeth
so
effective
some
of
yours
are
named
for
him
he
has
ir
vision
better
hearing
and
better
smell
than
you
do
and
most
likely
faster
reflexes
youre
on
a
motorcycle
hes
on
paws
roll
on
and
blow
him
off
he
doesnt
even
have
net
access
oh
bull
pucky
ed
they
use
dogs
because
a
many
people
are
scared
shitless
of
them
and
b
because
of
the
nose
and
the
vision
and
hearing
without
their
cop
partner
in
attendance
the
dog
is
so
much
meat
in
the
hands
of
any
human
with
a
bad
attitude
and
al
ittle
training
in
violent
force
oh
horse
puckey
without
their
cop
partner
in
attendance
they
are
less
likely
to
be
controllable
without
the
use
of
force
which
would
kill
the
dog
those
teeth
arent
very
much
good
with
an
arm
shoved
into
the
back
of
the
animals
throat
and
held
there
and
the
neck
is
not
ok
so
youve
disabled
the
dogs
mouth
and
given
up
use
of
your
arm
to
do
so
how
bout
them
front
and
read
paws
and
the
fact
that
to
plug
up
that
mouth
youve
given
the
dog
the
advantage
of
balance
espcially
strong
neither
are
the
leg
joints
which
can
be
easily
snapped
or
the
skull
easily
crushed
on
even
the
largest
dogs
have
you
ever
tried
to
snap
leg
or
crush
the
skull
of
a
dog
without
use
of
hardened
instruments
such
as
a
baseball
bat
without
the
use
of
both
arms
and
full
cooperation
of
the
beastie
involved
its
not
that
easy
oh
but
wait
youve
got
your
arm
shoved
in
the
dogs
mouth
you
lose
your
advice
is
correct
but
a
dog
is
still
no
match
for
a
trained
human
in
a
fight
oh
now
you
qualify
you
earlier
statement
by
saying
a
trained
human
sheesh
even
a
trained
attack
dog
is
no
match
for
a
human
we
have
all
the
advantages
most
people
here
have
not
been
trained
to
deal
with
a
dog
that
wants
to
maul
you
get
a
clue
regards
charles
within
the
span
of
the
last
few
weeks
i
have
heard
elements
of
separate
threads
which
in
that
they
have
been
conjoined
in
time
struck
together
to
form
a
new
chord
within
my
hollow
and
echoing
gourd

for
