giving
me
a
contact
to
purchase
a
pair
of
military
airborne
combat
boots
d
in
size
these
boots
so
i
have
read
here
on
recmoto
are
calf
height
boots
that
use
only
velcro
for
enclosure
i
have
phoned
around
and
nobody
seems
to
carry
such
an
item
i
admit
i
have
not
gone
into
the
deepest
bowels
of
nyc
yet
for
the
search
but
i
have
made
some
calls
to
several
of
the
bigger
armynavy
type
stores
with
no
luck
anyone
out
there
know
of
a
place
that
does
carry
such
an
item
as
well
as
does
mail
order
any
help
would
be
appreciated
currently
there
are
no
velcro
jump
boots
as
issue
in
the
military

are
two
other
kinds

for
in
either
the
clothing
sales
store
or
us
cavalry
price
match
at
the
cav
store
the
second
co
is
also
sold
but
somewhat
cheaper
in
design
actually
they
dont
care
what
you
wear
as
long
is
they
are
eyelets
high
there
is
another
boot
called
a
tankers
boot
this
has
similar
construction
to
a
wellington
boot
except
for
the
boot
shape
and
has
straps
that
wrap
around
for
tightness
