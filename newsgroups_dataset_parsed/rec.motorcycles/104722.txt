WRITES
DO
I
HAVE
TO
BE
THE
ONE
TO
SAY
IT
DONT
BE
SO
STUPID
AS
TO
LEAVE
YOUR
HELMET
ON
THE
SEAT
WHERE
IT
CAN
FALL
DOWN
AND
GO
BOOM
TRUE
ENOUGH
I
PUT
IT
ON
THE
GROUND
IF
ITS
FREE
OF
SPOOGE
OR
DIRECTLY
ON
MY
HEAD
OTHERWISE
THAT
KIND
OF
FALL
IS
WHAT
THE
HELMET
IS
DESIGNED
TO
PROTECT
AGAINST
NOT
EXACTLY
THE
HELMET
HAS
A
LOT
LESS
ENERGY
IF
YOUR
HEAD
ISNT
IN
IT
AND
THERES
NO
LUMP
INSIDE
TO
COMPRESS
THE
LINER
AGAINST
THE
SHELL
IS
A
DROP
OFF
THE
SEAT
ENOUGH
TO
CRACK
THE
SHELL
I
DOUBT
IT
BUT
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
SEND
IT
TO
BE
INSPECTED
IVE
BIKE
LIKE
