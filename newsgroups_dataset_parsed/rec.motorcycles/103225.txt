RE
FREEZING
AND
RIDING
EVERY
SPEC
OF
ALERTNESS
TO
KEEP
FROM
GETTING
SQUISHED
OTHERWISE
ITS
NOT
ONLY
DANGEROUS
ITS
UNPLEASANT
THE
SAME
GOES
FOR
COLD
AND
FATIGUE
AS
I
ONCE
TOOK
A
HALF
HOUR
NAP
AT
A
GAS
STATION
TO
INSURE
THAT
I
WOULD
MAKE
IT
YEAH
HYPOTHERMIA
IS
MUCH
MORE
DETRIMEMTAL
TO
YOUR
JUDGEMENT
AND
REACTIONS
THAN
PEOPLE
REALISE
I
WISH
I
HAD
THE
PATIENCE
TO
STOP
WHEN
I
SHOULD
ONE
DAY
ILL
PAY
FOR
IT
IF
YOU
BEGIN
TO
SHIVER
STOP
AND
WARM
UP
THOROUGHLY
IF
YOU
LEAVE
IT
TILL
THE
SHIVERING
STOPS
THIS
DOESNT
MEAN
YOURE
OK
AGAIN
IT
MEANS
YOURE
A
DANGER
TO
YOURSELF
AND
EVERYONE
ELSE
ON
THE
ROAD
YOUR
BRAIN
AND
BODY
ARE
WORKING
ABOUT
AS
FAST
AS
A
TREE
GROWS
YOU
WILL
NOT
REALISE
THIS
YOURSELF
TILL
YOU
HIT
SOMETHING
THE
NEXT
STAGE
IS
PASSING
OUT
THIS
USUALLY
MEANS
FALLING
OFF
