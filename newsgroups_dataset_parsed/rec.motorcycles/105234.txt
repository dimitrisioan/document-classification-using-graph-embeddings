shouldnt
get
flamed
for
being
a
cop

cant
promise
you
wont
because
there
are
jerks
on
this
newsgroup

as
any
other
but
if
youve
been
lurking
for
a
while
you
already
know
that
you
might
get
lots
of
flames
if
you
try
to
convince
people
that
you
know
more
than
them
just
because
you
have
a
badge
and
of
course
you
will
get
a
moderate
amount
of
flamage
just
for
expressing
an
opinion
no
matter
what
the
opinion
is
somebody
will
flame
you
for
it
