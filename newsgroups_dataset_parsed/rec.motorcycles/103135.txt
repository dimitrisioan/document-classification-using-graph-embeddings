thanks
for
the
compliments
allan
but
i
think
you
sidestepped
my
point
there
i
didnt
say
i
didnt
take
any
chances
sheesh
getting
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
is
risky
i
sprained
my
ankle
damn
right
i
was
late
for
a
climbing
meet
one
morning
so
i
got
out
of
bed
without
bothering
that
my
right
foot
was
still
asleep
it
reminded
me
by
folding
underneath
with
a
crunching
of
metatarsals
lucky
the
brakes
on
the
right
but
i
got
funny
looks
riding
thru
london
with
one
leg
held
aloft
climbing
wasnt
a
problem
the
best
splint
in
the
world
is
a
tight
climbing
shoe
