THANKS
FOR
THE
COMPLIMENTS
ALLAN
BUT
I
THINK
YOU
SIDESTEPPED
MY
POINT
THERE
I
DIDNT
SAY
I
DIDNT
TAKE
ANY
CHANCES
SHEESH
GETTING
OUT
OF
BED
IN
THE
MORNING
IS
RISKY
I
SPRAINED
MY
ANKLE
DAMN
RIGHT
I
WAS
LATE
FOR
A
CLIMBING
MEET
ONE
MORNING
SO
I
GOT
OUT
OF
BED
WITHOUT
BOTHERING
THAT
MY
RIGHT
FOOT
WAS
STILL
ASLEEP
IT
REMINDED
ME
BY
FOLDING
UNDERNEATH
WITH
A
CRUNCHING
OF
METATARSALS
LUCKY
THE
BRAKES
ON
THE
RIGHT
BUT
I
GOT
FUNNY
LOOKS
RIDING
THRU
LONDON
WITH
ONE
LEG
HELD
ALOFT
CLIMBING
WASNT
A
PROBLEM
THE
BEST
SPLINT
IN
THE
WORLD
IS
A
TIGHT
CLIMBING
SHOE
