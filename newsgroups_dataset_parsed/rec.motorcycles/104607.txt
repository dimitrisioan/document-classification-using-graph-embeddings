stuff
deleted
because
im
like
that
formal
training
is
in
my
view
absolutely
essential
if
youre
going
to
be
able
to
ride
a
bike
properly
and
safely
but
by
including
countersteering
theory
in
newbie
courses
we
are
confusing
people
unnecessarily
right
at
the
time
when
there
are
far
more
important
matters
for
them
to
learn
and
that
was
my
original
point

i
was
a
silver
starrider
instructor
for
a
while
i
learnt
about
countersteering
last
year
and
i
have
been
riding
bikes
since
we
were
never
told
about
countersteering
when
being
taught
to
instruct
it
doesnt
seem
to
have
affected
me
or
my
friends
or
pupils
we
just
rode
in
blissful
ignorance
