THIS
TACTIC
DEPENDS
FOR
ITS
EFFECTIVENESS
ON
THE
DOGS
CONFORMANCE
TO
A
PSYCHOLOGICAL
NORM
THAT
MAY
NOT
ACTUALLY
APPLY
TO
A
PARTICULAR
DOG
IVE
TRIED
IT
WITH
SOME
SUCCESS
BEFORE
BUT
IT
WONT
WORK
ON
A
CHARLIE
MANSON
DOG
OR
ONE
THATS
REALLY
REALLY
STUPID
A
LARGE
IRISH
SETTER
TAUGHT
ME
THIS
IN
MY
YARD
APPARENTLY
HIS
TERRITORY
ONE
DAY
IM
SURE
HE
WAS
PLAYING
A
GAME
WITH
ME
THE
GAME
WAS
PROBABLY
KILL
THE
VERY
ANGRY
NEIGHBOR
BEFORE
HE
CAN
DISPENSE
THE
TERRIBLE
PUNISHMENT
WHAT
A
DOG
WEIGHS
MAYBE
AT
MAX
YOU
CANT
HANDLE
IT
WE
WERE
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WITH
INSTABILITY
IN
THE
UNIVERSAL
GRAVITATIONAL
CONSTANT
THAT
DAY
THE
CLOSER
I
GOT
TO
THOSE
EXPOSED
FANGS
STILL
DRIPPING
NO
DOUBT
WITH
THE
VISCERA
OF
THE
LAST
FOOLHARDY
EXPERIMENTER
CUM
CANINE
PSYCHOLOGY
THE
BIGGER
AND
HEAVIER
THE
DOG
APPEARED
TO
BECOME
ALSO
RECALL
THAT
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
THE
IS
ONE
FIVE
POUND
JAWTEETH
OPERATED
BY
TWO
MUSCLES
DRIVEN
BY
A
OUNCE
BRAIN
POSSESSING
AN
INSTINCTUAL
HEURISTIC
COMPOSED
OF
EQUAL
PARTS
OF
BLOODLUST
AND
RAVENING
HUNGER
THE
OTHER
LB
IS
OF
COURSE
DOG
POOP
BUT
THAT
VARIES
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
AS
THE
DOG
DEPOSITS
IT
REGULARLY
ON
THE
PAINSTAKINGLY
MANICURED
AND
TENDED
LAWNS
OF
THE
DOGS
OWNERS
NEIGHBORS
WHILST
CONTINUOUSLY
REPLENISHING
ITS
INEXHAUSTIBLE
SUPPLY
NO
DOUBT
BY
CONSUMING
THE
LIKES
OF
FOLKS
LIKE
ME
YOU
HAVE
I
PRESUME
THUMBS
GRAPPLE
WITH
IT
AND
TEAR
ITS
HEAD
OFF
MY
VERY
THOUGHT
AT
THE
TIME
BUT
AS
I
LOOKED
DOWN
AT
THESE
ONCE
FORMIDABLE
INSTRUMENTS
OF
MAYHEM
I
REALIZED
THEY
HAD
BECOME
WEAK
AND
ATROPHIED
BY
TOO
MANY
SEDENTARY
HOURS
TAPPING
AWAY
AT
MY
ERGONOMICALLYCORRECT
CRT
KEYBOARD
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
OPTION
LEFT
I
REACHED
DOWN
TO
THE
TOOLBOX
NEAR
MY
CAR
AND
GRASPED
MY
CRAFTSMAN
FTLB
TORQUE
WRENCH
SURELY
THE
BLUDGEON
OF
DIRE
NECESSITY
IF
EVER
THERE
WAS
ONE
TO
MY
AMAZEMENT
AND
CONFUSION
THE
SETTER
STARTED
SHAKING
AND
ROLLING
ON
THE
GRASS
THEN
LEAPT
TO
ITS
FEET
AND
VANISHED
DOWN
THE
STREET
STILL
QUIVERING
AND
OCCASIONALLY
LOOKING
BACK
AT
ME
SEVEN
AT
ONE
BLOW
I
EXCLAIMED
FLEXING
MY
NEWFOUND
BICEPS
AND
BRANDISHING
MY
TERRIBLE
WEAPON
OF
INVINCIBILITY
AS
I
STALKED
THE
NOWSECURE
ENVIRONS
OF
MY
DOMICILE
IT
WAS
ONLY
LATER
THAT
I
FOUND
OUT
WHAT
THE
DOG
APPARENTLY
KNEW
ALL
ALONG
THE
WRENCH
WAS
DEFECTIVE
WOULD
NO
LONGER
MEASURE
TORQUE
ACCURATELY
AND
SEARS
WOULDNT
FIX
IT
OR
REPLACE
IT
WHAT
I
HAD
INTERPRETED
AS
FEAR
AND
SUBSERVIENCE
WERE
IN
FACT
UNMITIGATED
HILARITY
AND
CONTEMPT
SHEESH
EVEN
A
TRAINED
ATTACK
DOG
IS
NO
MATCH
FOR
A
HUMAN
WE
HAVE
ALL
THE
ADVANTAGES
EXACTLY
NOBODY
CAN
LOOK
QUITE
AS
SILLY
AS
WE
CAN
CHUCK
ROGERS
