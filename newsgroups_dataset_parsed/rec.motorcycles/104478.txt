after
both
oil
changes
the
oil
level
was
at
the
top
mark
in
the
window
on
the
lower
right
side
of
the
motor
but
ive
been
noticing
that
the
oil
level
seen
in
the
window
gradually
decreases
over
the
miles
im
always
checking
the
window
with
the
bike
on
level
ground
and
after
it
has
sat
idle
for
awhile
so
the
oil
has
a
chance
to
drain
back
into
the
pan
the
bike
isnt
leaking
oil
any
place
and
i
dont
see
any
smoke
coming
out
of
the
exhaust
my
owners
manual
says
the
amount
of
oil
corresponding
to
the
high
and
low
marks
in
the
oil
level
window
is
approx
quart
it
looks
like
my
bike
has
been
using
about
miles
the
owners
manual
also
gives
a
figure
for
max
oil
consumption
of
about
or
my
question
is
whether
the
degree
of
oil
consumption
im
seeing
on
my
bike
is
normal
have
any
other
owners
seen
their
oil
level
gradually
and
consistently
go
down
should
i
take
the
bike
in
for
work
im
asking
local
guys
also
to
get
as
many
data
points
as
i
can
its
normal
for
the
bmw
k
bikes
to
use
a
little
oil
in
the
first
few
thousand
miles
i
dont
know
why
ive
had
three
new
k
bikes
and
all
three
used
a
bit
of
oil
when
new
max
maybe
quart
in
first
miles
this
soon
quits
and
by
the
time
i
had
miles
on
them
the
oil
consumption
was
about
zero
ive
been
told
that
the
harder
you
run
the
bike
within
reason
the
sooner
it
stops
using
any
oil
