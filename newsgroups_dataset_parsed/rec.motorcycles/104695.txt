my
fzrs
black
exhaust
pipes
are
rusty
and
i
researched
getting
them
repaired
yesterday
i
bought
a
can
of
vht
degree
black
header
paint
and
spent
an
hour
sanding
two
of
the
header
pipes
by
hand
sprayed
on
paint
thought
about
how
clean
i
was
able
to
get
the
metal
with
sanding
and
determined
that
i
wouldnt
be
at
all
suprised
if
the
paint
worechipped
off
in
a
month

why
not
just
purchase
one
of
the
fyex
exhaust
bras
for
about
they
look
great
and
are
cheaper
than
powder
coating
i
had
the
same
dilemma
and
opted
for
these
i
am
quite
pleased
ok
so
whats
an
exhaust
bra
im
guessing
its
not
a
fabric
thing
that
straps
to
the
pipes
does
it
go
over
the
chin
fairinglowers
in
some
way
i
usually
dont
ride
with
the
lower
