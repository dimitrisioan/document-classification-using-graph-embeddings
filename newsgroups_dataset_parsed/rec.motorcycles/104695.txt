MY
FZRS
BLACK
EXHAUST
PIPES
ARE
RUSTY
AND
I
RESEARCHED
GETTING
THEM
REPAIRED
YESTERDAY
I
BOUGHT
A
CAN
OF
VHT
DEGREE
BLACK
HEADER
PAINT
AND
SPENT
AN
HOUR
SANDING
TWO
OF
THE
HEADER
PIPES
BY
HAND
SPRAYED
ON
PAINT
THOUGHT
ABOUT
HOW
CLEAN
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
THE
METAL
WITH
SANDING
AND
DETERMINED
THAT
I
WOULDNT
BE
AT
ALL
SUPRISED
IF
THE
PAINT
WORECHIPPED
OFF
IN
A
MONTH
PARTS
DELETED
AXEL
AXEL
WHY
NOT
JUST
PURCHASE
ONE
OF
THE
FYEX
EXHAUST
BRAS
FOR
ABOUT
THEY
LOOK
GREAT
AND
ARE
CHEAPER
THAN
POWDER
COATING
I
HAD
THE
SAME
DILEMMA
AND
OPTED
FOR
THESE
I
AM
QUITE
PLEASED
OK
SO
WHATS
AN
EXHAUST
BRA
IM
GUESSING
ITS
NOT
A
FABRIC
THING
THAT
STRAPS
TO
THE
PIPES
DOES
IT
GO
OVER
THE
CHIN
FAIRINGLOWERS
IN
SOME
WAY
I
USUALLY
DONT
RIDE
WITH
THE
LOWER
PLASTIC
AXEL
