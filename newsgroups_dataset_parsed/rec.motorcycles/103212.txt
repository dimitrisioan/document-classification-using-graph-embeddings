THIS
PROCEDURE
I
CAN
VISUALIZE
FEWER
PROBLEMS
WITH
CANTING
PISTONS
IN
THE
CYLINDERS
WITH
THIS
METHOD
BUT
MORE
TROUBLE
WITH
KEEPING
THE
BORES
SUSPENDED
ESPECIALLY
FOR
THE
FIRST
TWO
PISTONS
AND
WITH
WORKING
SPACE
TO
INSERT
PISTON
PINS
AND
CLIPS
ESPECIALLY
FOR
THE
LAST
TWO
PISTONS
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
POSSIBLE
AND
QUITE
EASY
IN
MOST
CASES
ESPECIALLY
ON
TWOSTROKES
ITS
VERY
COMMON
TO
DO
THIS
ON
BIKES
WHERE
THE
CYLINDERMOUNTING
THROUGHSTUDS
DONT
PREVENT
THE
CYLINDER
FROM
BEING
REMOVED

THE
ENGINE
IN
THE
FRAME
I
DID
THIS
WHEN
I
ASSEMBLED
THE

ON
MY
INDIAN
WHICH
WAS
EASIER
YET
BECAUSE
IT
DOES

YOU
