this
in
todays
newspaper

barred
from
bars
barnstaple
englandreuter
a
motorcyclist
said
to
have
drunk
away
a
insurance
payment
in
less
than
years
was
banned
wednesday
from
every
pub
in
england
and
wales
david
roberts
had
been
awarded
the
cash
in
compensation
for
losing
a
leg
in
a
motorcycle
accident
he
spent
virtually
all
of
it
on
cider
a
court
in
barnstaple
in
southwest
england
was
told
judge
malcolm
coterill
banned
roberts
from
all
bars
in
england
and
wales
for
months
and
put
on
two
years
probation
after
he
started
a
brawl
in
a
pub
is
there
no
justice
if
i
lost
my
leg
when
i
was
and
had
to
give
up
motorcycling
assuming
david
didnt
know
that
it
can
be
done
onelegged
i
too
would
want
to
get
swamped
maybe
even
for
ten
years
ill
admit
id
probably
prefer
homebrew
to
pubbrew
but
still
judge
coterill
is
in
some
serious
trouble
i
can
tell
you
that
any
chance
you
can
get
to
him
and
convince
him
his
ruling
was
backward
nick
perhaps
the
lad
deserved
something
for
starting
a
brawl
bad
form
horribly
bad
form
but
for
getting
drunk
that
i
thought
was
ones
natural
born
right
and
for
spending
his
own
money
my
goodness
who
cares
what
one
does
with
ones
own
moolah
even
if
one
spends
it
recklessly
im
ashamed
of
humanity
