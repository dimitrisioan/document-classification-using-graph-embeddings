LOSS
UNDER

OF
A
HONDA
I
HAVE
A
HONDA
WHICH
FOR
MOST
OF
MY
PURPOSES
RUNS
WELL
HOWEVER
I
EXPEREINCE
A
SEVERE
POWER
DROP
AT
CRUISING
SPEEDS
UNDER
LOAD
THAT
IS
ON
A
MILD
UPGRADE
MPH
IN
OR
IM
LUCKY
IF
I
CAN
HOLD
SPEED
IF
I
TRY
TO
ADD
THROTTLE
MUCH
PAST
RPM
POWER
DROPS
DRASTICALLY
PUT
SIMPLY
UNDER
LOAD
THE
ENGINE
WONT
REV
PAST
RPM
THE
TOP
THIRDHALF
OF
THE
THROTTLE
RANGE
IS
DEAD
STANDING
STILL
THE
ENGINE
RUNS
FINE
UP
TO
RED
LINE
OTHER
PHENOMENOLOGY
AT
ABOUT
THE
POINT
THAT
POWER
LOSS
KICKS
IN
THE
ENGINE
BECOMES
A
LITTLE
WAVERY
THAT
IS
AT
A
STEADY
THROTTLE
THE
ENGINE
SPEED
GOES
UP
AND
DOWN
SLIGHTLY
THE
BIKE
HAS
ABOUT
MILES
ON
IT
AND
IS
IN
GOOD
TUNE
AT
LEAST
UNTIL
IT
STARTS
TO
BALK
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
AS
TO
WHATS
AILING
THE
POOR
BEAST
MY
THOUGHTS
RUN
TOWARD
CLOGGED
JETS
ANDOR
IMPROPER
SPARK
ADVANCE
IM
HOPING
ITS
NOT
SOMETHING
MORE
DRASTIC
SINCE
THE
BIKES
NOT
REALLY
WORTH
THE
HASSLE
OF
ANY
MAJOR
ENGINE
