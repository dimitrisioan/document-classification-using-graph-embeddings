i
just
mailed
this
i
noticed
a
long
cut
in
the
tread
of
the
rear
tire
on
my
vfr
the
cut
is
only
about
as
deep
as
the
tread
block
and
looks
like
it
only
scratched
the
rubber
at
the
base
but
the
weird
thing
is
its
way
over
on
the
edge
where
i
havent
scuffed
the
tire
in
yet
my
questions
are
how
dangerous
is
this
should
i
replace
the
tire
right
away
and
if
i
should
since
the
cut
is
on
the
unscuffed
portion
and
the
tire
only
has
about
mi
on
it
what
do
you
think
my
chances
of
getting
it
replaced
under
warranty
are
to
the
nedod
mailing
list
and
jack
tavares
suggested
i
check
out
how
old
the
tire
is
as
one
tactic
for
getting
it
replaced
does
anyone
have
the
file
on
how
to
read
the
date
codes
handy
