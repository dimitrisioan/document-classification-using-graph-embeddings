to
those
of
you
who
have
the
bmw
heated
handgrips
are
they
comfortable
do
they
transmit
a
lot
of
vibration
how
do
they
compare
to
the
stock
grips
to
foam
grips
i
dont
have
the
grips
but
have
looked
into
getting
them
its
my
understanding
that
the
grips
themselves
are
the
standard
european
style
grips
now
coming
standard
on
the
bikes
etc
its
also
my
understanding
that
the
heater
resides
inside
the
bar
itself
so
if
anything
i
would
suspect
it
would
reduce
vibration
by
providing
more
bar
end
mass
i
dont
see
why
they
wouldnt
work
with
the
old
style
foam
grips
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
might
cause
the
foam
to
deteriorate
or
something
hard
to
belive
considering
they
do
fine
in
the
degree
texas
summers
someone
once
sold
heated
motorcycle
grips
via
mail
order
the
were
aftermarket
replacement
grips
that
had
the
heating
elements
mlded
into
the
grip
itself
wires
ran
outside
of
the
bars
from
the
grips
to
a
switch
and
finaly
the
battery
cycle
magazine
tested
them
years
ago
and
liked
them
dunno
if
they
are
still
made
might
check
with
the
snowmobile
