AIRHORNS
ON
AN
REVIEW
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
ARE
THINKING
ABOUT
FIAMMS
YOU
MIGHT
ALSO
WANT
TO
THINK
ABOUT
AIRHORNS
I
JUST
INSTALLED
A
SET
OF
BOSCH
AIR
HORNS
ORDERED
FROM
DENNIS
KIRK
PG
OF
THE
LATEST
CATALOG
ON
MY
THEY
ARE
RATED
AT
AT
METERS
I
INSTALLED
THEM
USING
GAGE
WIRE
FROM
THE
BATTERY
TO
THE
RELAY
TO
THE
COMPRESSOR
TO
GROUND
MY
STOCK
HORN
CONNECTORS
FIT
THE
RELAY
PINS
JUST
FINE
I
SOLDERED
THE
CONNECTIONS
TO
THE
RELAY
AND
COMPRESSOR
AND
USED
A
CRIMP
TYPE
BATTERY
CONNECTOR
AND
AN
INLINE
FUSECONNECTOR
FROM
NAPA
I
INSTALLED
THE
COMPRESSOR
JUST
FORWARD
OF
THE
FUSE
BOX
IN
THE
FRONT
FAIRING
BY
TIE
WRAPPING
BETWEEN
THE
STEERING
HEAD
FRAME
AND
THE
BLACK
STEEL
TUBE
FRAME
USED
TO
SUPPORT
THE
FRONT
FAIRING
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
FRONT
FAIRING
TO
DO
THIS
BUT
IT
FITS
OUTSIDE
OF
THE
FRAME
BUT
INSIDE
THE
FAIRING
ON
THE
TWO
VERTICAL
SUPPORTS
JUST
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
FUSES
DEPENDING
HOW
TIGHT
YOUR
FAIRING
FOLLOWS
THE
FRAME
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
FIT
IT
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
FAIRING
THE
COMPRESSOR
IS
ABOUT
IN
DIAMETER
AND
ABOUT
LONG
THE
RELAY
MOUNTED
ON
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
STEERING
HEAD
FRAME
IT
IS
SMALL
SO
THERE
SHOULD
BE
PLENTY
OF
GOOD
PLACES
FOR
IT
I
FOUND
A
PERFECT
PLACE
FOR
THE
HORNS
THAT
REQUIRED
ONLY
TIE
WRAPS
TO
MOUNT
THE
HORNS
FIT
INSIDE
THE
FRONT
FAIRINGFRAME
AND
STICK
OUT
ON
EITHER
SIDE
JUST
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
AIR
SCOOPS
BUT
BEHIND
THE
TURN
SIGNALS
THE
BACK
OF
THE
HORNS
POINT
BACK
TOWARDS
THE
CENTER
OF
THE
BIKE
AND
COME
REAL
CLOSE
TO
WHERE
THE
GAS
TANK
CONNECTS
TO
THE
FRONT
PART
OF
THE
FRAME
THERE
IS
JUST
ENOUGH
ROOM
TO
THE
OUTSIDE
TO
ALLOW
FULL
LOCK
TO
LOCK
CLEARANCE
AND
THERE
ARE
NICE
CUT
OUTS
IN
THE
FRAME
FOR
THE
BACK
OF
THE
HORN
TO
GO
INTO
THE
SHORT
HORN
IS
EVEN
WITH
THE
FAIRING
AND
THE
LONG
ONE
STICKS
OUT
ABOUT
AN
INCH
OR
SO
BUT
IT
IS
REALLY
NOT
THAT
NOTICABLE
UNLESS
YOU
LOOK
CLOSELY
THEY
END
UP
POINTING
DOWN
SLIGHTLY
AND
MAYBE
DEGREES
FROM
STRAIGHT
AHEAD
PERFECT
FOR
THOSE
CAGERS
TRYING
TO
CHANGE
LANES
INTO
YOU
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
OTHER
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
MOUNTING
EMAIL
AND
I
CAN
TRY
TO
EXPLAIN
BETTER
IF
YOUR
BIKE
IS
NOT
RED
THEN
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
PAINT
THEM
FIRST
HOW
DO
THEY
WORK
YOU
ASK
THEY
ARE
VERY
VERY
VERY
LOUD
THEY
SOUND
MORE
LIKE
A
EUROPEAN
SPORTS
CAR
THAN
A
TRUCK
BUT
A
VAST
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
STOCK
I
HAVE
USED
THEM
AT
LEAST
DAILY
SINCE
INSTALLING
THEM
AND
THE
AMP
FUSE
HAS
NOT
BLOWN
YET
ALTHOUGH
THE
DURATION
OF
THE
HORN
BLASTS
HAVE
BEEN
SHORT
IVE
REPEATEDLY
SCARED
THE
SHIT
OUT
OF
MY
FRIENDS
WITH
THEM
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
KNOW
THAT
I
HAVE
THE
HORNS
THEY
STILL
JUMP
THEY
ARE
PERFECT
FOR
KEEPING
THE
PEDESTRIANS
ON
THE
SIDEWALK
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
THEY
WORK
ARE
LOUD
ENOUGH
TO
CAUSE
PAIN
AND
SUFFERING
TO
THOSE
STUPID
LANE
CHANGING
CAGES
AS
WELL
AS
TAKE
A
FEW
YEARS
OFF
THEIR
LIVES
AND
ARE
RELATIVELY
EASY
TO
INSTALL
ON
THE
FJ
YMMV
TJK
WITH
GET
OUT
OF
MY
WAY
HORNS
THAT
LOOKS
LIKE
A
SUIT
YOUD
FIGHT
A
FIRE
IN
COMMENT
ABOUT
THE
AEROSTICH
