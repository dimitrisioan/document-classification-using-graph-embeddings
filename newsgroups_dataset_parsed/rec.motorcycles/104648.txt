my
wife
is
looking
for
a
jacket
and
most
of
the
mens
styles
shes
tried
dont
fit
too
well
if
they
fit
the
shoulders
and
arms
theyre
too
tight
across
the
chest
or
something
like
that
anyone
have
any
suggestions
im
assuming
that
the
vpilot
in
addition
to
its
handy
storage
facilities
is
a
pretty
decent
fit
is
there
any
company
that
makes
a
reasonable
line
of
womens
motorcycling
stuff
more
importantly
does
anyone
in
boulder
or
denver
know
of
a
shop
that
bothers
carrying
any
theres
an
article
in
motorcycling
a
couple
of
months
back
specifically
on
womens
attire
for
serious
and
notsoserious
riding
they
do
mention
who
makes
stuff
specific
for
womens
dimensions
and
what
also
works
ok
enough
as
well
bates
will
make
custom
jackets
and
leathers
for
a
reasonable
charge
