CRAPPY
HONDA
HI
I
JUST
HAVE
A
SMALL
QUESTION
ABOUT
MY
BIKE
BEING
A
FAIRLY
EXPERIENCED
BMW
AND
MZMECHANIC
I
JUST
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
THINK
ABOUT
MY
HONDA
SHE
WAS
USING
TOO
MUCH
OIL
FOR
THE
LAST
KM
ON
MY
TRIP
TO
DAYTONA
BIKE
WEEK
THIS
SPRING
AND
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN
SHE
TRAILED
SMOKE
LIKE
HELL
AND
WAS
RUNNING
ONLY
ON
ONE
CYLINDER
I
TOWED
THE
BIKE
HOME
AND
TOOK
IT
APART
BUT
EVERYTHING
LOOKS
IN
PERFECT
WORKING
ORDER
NO
CRACKS
IN
THE
HEADS
OR
PISTONS
THE
CYLINDER
WALLS
LOOK
VERY
CLEAN
AND
THE
WEAR
OF
PISTONS
AND
CYLINDERS
IS
NOT
MEASURABLE
ALL
STILL
WITHIN
FACTORY
SPECS
THE
ONLY
THING
I
COULD
FIND
HOWEVER
WAS
A
SLIGHTLY
BIGGER
RING
GAP
ON
THE
RIGHT
CYLINDER
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
PROBLEM
BUT
IT
IS
STILL
WAY
BELOW
THE
WEARLIMIT
GIVEN
IN
THE
CLYMERMANUAL
FOR
THIS
BIKE
ANY
SYGGESTIONS
WHAT
ELSE
COULD
CAUSE
MY
PROBLEM
DO
I
HAVE
TO
HONE
THE
CYLINDER
WALLS
MAKE
THEM
A
LITTLE
ROUGHER
IN
A
CRISSCROSSPATTERN
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
BETTER
BREAKING
IN
OF
MY
NEW
RINGS
WONT
THAT
INCREASE
THE
WEAR
OF
MY
PISTONS
PLEASE
SEND
COMMENTS
