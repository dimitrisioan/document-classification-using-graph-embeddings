NO
NO
NO
NO
ALL
I
AM
SAYING
IS
THAT
YOU
DONT
EVEN
NEED
TO
TELL
PEOPLE
THE
TECHNIQUE
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
COS
THEY
WILL
DO
IT
INTUITIVELY
THE
FIRST
TIME
THEY
TRY
TO
GO
ROUND
A
CORNER
SOME
WILL
AND
OTHERS
WILL
STEER
WITH
THEIR
TUCHUSES
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
MUCH
THE
TEACHING
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
IN
THE
BEGINNER
COURSE
REALLY
HELPS
THE
TUCHUS
STEERERS
I
WAS
ONE
I
GUESS
THAT
I
ALWAYS
STEERED
A
BICYCLE
THAT
WAY
AND
I
ONLY
GOT
THE
HANG
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
IN
NORMAL
RIDING
AFTER
THE
COURSE
I
COULD
DO
THE
COUNTERSTEERING
SWERVES
IN
THE
COURSE
NO
PROBLEM
BUT
I
ONLY
STARTED
USING
IT
IN
MY
NORMAL
RIDING
WHEN
I
DECIDED
THAT
MY
TURNING
AT
SPEED
OFFRAMPS
AND
THE
LIKE
WAS
A
LOT
MORE
DIFFICULT
THAT
IT
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
I
KNEW
HOW
IT
WORKS
ALTHOUGH
THATS
CURRENTLY
UP
FOR
DEBATE
DEFINITELY
KNEW
THAT
IT
WORKS
AS
I
COULD
DO
IT
IN
SWERVES
BUT
ONLY
FIGURED
IT
OUT
LATER
IN
MY
NORMAL
RIDING
JUST
A
DATA
POINT
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
NOT
A
BAD
IDEA
TO
BRING
THE
IDEA
UP
BUT
ITS
BEST
TO
LET
EVERYONE
TUCHUSSTEER
FOR
THE
FIRST
LESSON
OR
TWO
SO
THEY
CAN
LEARN
TO
SHIFT
GEARS
BEFORE
THEY
HAVE
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
PROPER
HANDLEBAR
TECHNIQUE
COUNTERSTEERING
IN
FACT
MY
EXPERIENCED
RIDER
COURSE
INSTRUCTORS
CLAIMED
THAT
THEY
COULD
GET
ON
BEHIND
A
NEW
RIDER
AND
MAKE
THE
BIKE
TURN
TO
WHICHEVER
SIDE
THEY
WANTED
JUST
BY
SHIFTING
THEIR
WEIGHT
AROUND
EVEN
WHEN
THE
OPERATOR
WAS
TRYING
TO
TURN
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
I
ADMIT
IVE
NEVER
ACTUALLY
SEEN
THIS
I
HAVE
IN
OUR
BEGINNER
COURSE
WE
HAD
PASSENGER
TRAINING
SOMETIME
DURING
THE
LESSON
THE
INSTRUCTOR
WOULD
HOP
ON
THE
BACK
OF
THE
BIKE
AND
THE
STUDENT
WOULD
TAKE
HIM
FOR
A
RIDE
IF
THE
STUDENT
DID
NOT
GIVE
THE
INSTRUCTOR
THE
YOU
ARE
A
SACK
OF
POTATOES
PASSENGER
SPEECH
THE
INSTRUCTOR
WOULD
STEER
THE
BIKE
AND
MAKE
A
GENERAL
NUISANCE
OF
HIMSELF
IT
WAS
AMUSING
TO
WATCH
IM
JUST
HAPPY
THAT
IT
DIDNT
HAPPEN
TO
ME
IVE
BIKE
