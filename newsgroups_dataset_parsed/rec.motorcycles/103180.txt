RE
WHY
I
WONT
BE
GETTING
MY
LOW
RIDER
THIS
YEAR
IN
ARTICLE
CHARLESAROGERS
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
PETER
AHRENS
WRITES
THAT
WOULD
BE
LOW
DRAG
BARS
AND
WAY
RAD
REARSETS
FOR
THE
FJ
SO
THAT
THE
ERGONOMIC
CONSTRAINTS
WOULD
HAVE
CONTRACEPTIVE
CONSEQUENCES
OUCH
THIS
BRINGS
TO
MIND
ONE
OF
THE
RECOMMENDATIONS
IN
THE
HURT
STUDY
BECAUSE
THE
REAR
OF
THE
GAS
TANK
IS
IN
CLOSE
PROXIMITY
TO
HIGHLY
PRIZED
AND
EASILY
DAMAGED
ANATOMY
HURT
ET
AL
RECOMMENDED
THAT
MANUFACTURERS
BUILD
THE
TANK
SO
AS
TO
REDUCE
THE
ER
STEP
FUNCTION
PROVIDED
WHEN
THE
RIDERS
BODY
SLIDES
OFF
OF
THE
SEAT
AND
ONTO
THE
GAS
TANK
IN
THE
UNFORTUNATE
EVENT
THAT
THE
BIKE
STOPS
SUDDENLY
AND
THE
RIDER
DOESNT
I
THINK
ITS
REALLY
INSPIRING
HOW
THE
MANUFACTURERS
HAVE
TAKEN
THIS
ADVICE
TO
HEART
IN
THEIR
DESIGN
OF
BIKES
LIKE
THE
AND
THE
I
DUNNO
ON
MY
OLD
THE
TANKSEAT
JUNCTION
WAS
NICE
AND
SMOOTH
BUT
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
TRAVEL
ALL
THE
WAY
FORWARD
YOUD
COLLECT
THE
TOP
TRIPLECLAMP
IN
A
SENSITIVE
AREA
ID
HATE
TO
HAVE
TO
MAKE
THE
CHOICE
BUT
I
THINK
ID
PREFER
THE
FJS
GAS
TANK
