was
raining
cats

i
was
going
only
to
the
speed
limit
on
nothing
more
on
my
bike
this
guy
in
his
bmw
was
driving
meters
behind
me
for
meters
and
at
the
next
red
light
i
calmly
put
the
bike
on
its
leg
walked
back
to
this
car
he
rolled
down
the
window
and
i
told
him
he
was
a
total
idiot
and
the
reason
why
did
i
do
the
right
thing
yours
truly
niels

me
proud
to
be
an
merkun
good
thing

try
that
with
a
goodole
boy
in
texas
i
once
had
a
jeep
driver
south
of
conroe
cut
me
off
i
was
in
my
car
after
i
had
flipped
him
off
for
doing
something
really
idiotic
and
senseless
all
lbs
of
him
stretches
out
of
his
jeep
he
walks
back
he
is
blocking
all
traffic
between
dallas
and
houston
since
the
freeway
has
been
squeezed
into
a
single
lane
and
says
to
me
stick
that
finger
out
again
and
ill
rip
it
off
your
hand
and
shove
it
down
your
sorryass
throat
i
stared
straight
ahead
unblinking
a
hundred
cars
were
honking
eventually
he
got
back
into
his
jeep
face
beetred
with
anger
and
all
the
rest
of
the
way
back
to
houston
i
tailed
him
waving
honking
flipping
him
off
yelling
im
glad
he
decided
not
to
shoot
me
