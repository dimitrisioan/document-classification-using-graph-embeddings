WRITES
THE
QUESTION
FOR
THE
DAY
IS
RE
PASSENGER
HELMETS
IF
YOU
DONT
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
WHOS
GONNA
RIDE
WITH
YOU
LIKE
SAY
YOU
MEET
THEM
AT
A
CHURCH
MEETING
YEAH
THATS
THE
TICKET
WHAT
ARE
SOME
GUIDELINES
SHOULD
I
JUST
PICK
UP
ANOTHER
SHOEI
IN
MY
SIZE
TO
HAVE
A
BACKUP
HELMET
XL
OR
SHOULD
I
MAYBE
GET
AN
INEXPENSIVE
ONE
OF
A
SMALLER
SIZE
TO
ACCOMODATE
MY
LIKELY
PASSENGER
IF
YOUR
PRIMARY
CONCERN
IS
PROTECTING
THE
PASSENGER
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
A
CRASH
HAVE
HIM
OR
HER
FITTED
FOR
A
HELMET
THAT
IS
THEIR
SIZE
IF
YOUR
PRIMARY
CONCERN
IS
COMPLYING
WITH
STUPID
HELMET
LAWS
CARRY
A
REAL
BIG
SPARE
YOU
CAN
PUT
A
BIG
OR
SMALL
HEAD
IN
A
BIG
HELMET
BUT
NOT
IN
A
SMALL
ONE
ED
GREEN
FORMER
NINJAITE

WAS
DRINKING
LAST
NIGHT

A
BIKER
