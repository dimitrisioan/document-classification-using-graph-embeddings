re
your
opinion
and
what
it
means
to
me
some
real
stupid
remarks

beav
should
lighten
up
esp
the
beav
i
agree
that
lots
of
serious
dribble
for
no
real
reason
hey
i
dont
really
care
but
when
someone
sends
me
email
telling
me
to
fuck
off
i
get
rather
pissed
if
he
posted
to
the
net
i
could
really
care
less
but
sending
mail
is
just
childish
mr
infante
is
just
that
an
infant
give
him
a
few
more
years
to
grow
up
and
maybe
hell
learn
some
network
etiquette
if
you
cant
stand
the
flames
and
you
dont
have
the
brains
stay
out
of
the
newsgroup
kind
of
catchy
