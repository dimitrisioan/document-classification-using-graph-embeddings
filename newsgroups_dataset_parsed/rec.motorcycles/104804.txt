RE
COUNTERSTEERING
TO

NOT

MIKE
SIXSMITH
SAID
MIKE
JERRY
LOTTO
WRITES
ME
THE
UNDERSTANDING
AND
ABILITY
TO
SWERVE
WAS
ESSENTIALLY
ABSENT
AMONG
ME
THE
ACCIDENTINVOLVED
RIDERS
IN
THE
HURT
STUDY
MIKE
I
WOULD
AGREE
ENTIRELY
WITH
THESE
THREE
PARAGRAPHS
BUT
DID
THE
HURT
MIKE
STUDY
MAKE
ANY
DISTINCTION
BETWEEN
AN
ABILITY
TO
SWERVE
AND
A
FAILURE
MIKE
TO
SWERVE
YES
IT
WAS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
ABILITY
OR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
TECHNIQUE
WHICH
WAS
ABSENT
WE
HAVE
MADE
A
LOT
OF
PROGRESS
BETWEEN
RIDER
EDUCATION
AND
RESPONSIBILITY
OVER
THE
LAST
TENTWENTY
YEARS
BUT
I
AM
STILL
AMAZED
ANYTIME
I
TEACH
AN
ERC
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
OF
MANY
YEAR
RIDING
EXPERIENCE
DISCOVER
COUNTERSTEERING
FOR
CORNERING
OR
SWERVING
MIKE
EVERYTHING
ELSE
HARD
BRAKING
AND
SWERVING
TEND
TO
BE
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
MIKE
MANOUVRES
DID
HURT
DRAW
ANY
CONCLUSIONS
ON
WHICH
ONE
IS
GENERALLY
MIKE
PREFERABLE
THE
SPECIFIC
RECOMMANDATION
CITED
IN
THE
HURT
STUDY
WAS
THAT
A
FORMAL
STREET
STRATEGY
LIKE
SIPDE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WAS
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
COMPONENT
OF
ANY
RIDER
EDUCATION
CURRICULUM
THE
SPECIFIC
SKILLS
OF
EMERGENCY
BRAKING
CORNERING
AND
SWERVING
MUST
BE
TAUGHT
AND
PRACTICED
AS
WELL
BUT
MORE
SIGNIFICANT
WAS
THAT
OF
RIDER
DID
NOTHING
CONFRONTED
WITH
A
POTENTIAL
ACCIDENT
AND
ANOTHER
THIRD
COLLIDED
OR
FELL
OVER
AS
A
RESULT
OF
RIDER
ERROR
THE
CHOICE
OF
SPECIFIC
MANEUVER
IS
MUCH
LESS
SIGNIFICANT
TO
THE
OUTCOME
THAN
EARLY
DETECTION
AND
THE
PROPER
EXECUTION
OF
ANY
EFFECTIVE
COUNTERMEASURE
