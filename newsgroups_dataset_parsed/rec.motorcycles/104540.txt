GOOD
REASONS
TO
WAVE
AT
EACH
OTHER
ONE
OF
THOSE
MORNING
JUST
GETTING
THE
COFFEE
IN
ME
THOUGHTS
WAVING
AT
OTHER
BIKERS
MAKES
MORE
SENSE
THAN
JUST
HEY
HOWS
IT
GOING
NICE
TO
MEET
YOU
ON
THE
ROAD
HAVE
A
GOOD
RIDE
IF
YOURE
WATCHING
FOR
OTHER
BIKES
TO
WAVE
TO
IT
MEANS
YOUR
ATTENTION
IS
ON
THE
ROAD
WHERE
IT
SHOULD
BE
AND
YOURE
MORE
LIKELY
TO
SEE
CAGES
IT
KEEPS
YOU
IN
THE
HABIT
OF
WATCHING
REALLY
CAREFULLY
FOR
BIKES
WHEN
YOURE
IN
A
CAGE
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
THING
