life
is
so
hard
my
wife
is
looking
for
a
jacket
and
most
of
the
mens
styles
shes
tried
dont
fit
too
well
if
they
fit
the
shoulders
and
arms
theyre
too
tight
across
the
chest
or
something
like
that
anyone
have
any
suggestions
im
assuming
that
the
vpilot
in
addition
to
its
handy
storage
facilities
is
a
pretty
decent
fit
is
there
any
company
that
makes
a
reasonable
line
of
womens
motorcycling
stuff
more
importantly
does
anyone
in
boulder
or
denver
know
of
a
shop
that
bothers
carrying
any
i
was
very
lucky
i
found
a
jacket
i
liked
that
actually
fits
hg
makes
the
vpilot
jackets
mine
is
a
very
similar
style
made
by
just
leather
in
san
jose
i
bought
one
of
the
last
two
they
ever
made
finding
decent
womens
motorcycling
gear
is
not
easy
there
is
a
lot
of
stuff
out
there
thats
fringed
everywhere
made
of
fashion
leather
made
to
fit
men
etc
i
dont
know
of
a
shop
in
your
area
there
are
some
women
rider
friendly
places
in
the
san
franciscosan
jose
area
but
i
dont
recommend
buying
clothing
mail
order
too
hard
to
tell
if
itll
fit
bates
custom
makes
leathers
you
might
want
to
call
them
theyre
in
la
and
get
a
cost
estimate
for
the
type
of
jacket
your
wife
is
interested
in
large
manufacturers
like
bmw
and
hg
sell
womens
lines
of
clothing
of
decent
quality
but
fit
is
iffy
a
while
ago
noemi
and
lisa
sieverts
were
talking
about
starting
a
business
doing
just
this
sort
of
thing
dont

decided

to

that
johns
