i
am
looking
for
advice
on
what
bikes
i
should
check
out
i
am
tall
and
find
my
legships
uncomfortably
bent
on
most
of
the
bikes
i
have
ridden
not
many
admittedly
are
there
any
bikes
out
there
built
for
a
taller
rider
theres
plenty
of
legroom
on
the
kawasaki
a
bit
short
in
the
braking
department
for
spirited
street
riding
but
enough
for
dirt
and
for
lessagressive
street
stuff
