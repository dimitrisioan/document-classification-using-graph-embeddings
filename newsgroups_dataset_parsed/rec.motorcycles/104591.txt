YOUR
OPINION
AND
WHAT
IT
MEANS
TO
ME
IN

ANDREW
INFANTE
WRITES
WELL
AS
A
FEW
OF
YOU
SO
APTLY
PUT
IT
GET
OFF
THE
ROAD
JERK
WE
DONT
WANNA
HEAR
YOUR
WHINING
FINE
FUCK
OFF
TOO
IF
YOU
NOTICED
IT
WAS
IN
MORE
THAN
TWO
YEARS
AGO
AND
YES
IVE
LEARNED
AND
ITS
COST
ME
AND
YES
IVE
KNOWN
PEOPLE
FRIENDS
AND
RELATIVES
WHOVE
BEEN
INVOLVED
IN
DRUNKRELATED
ACCIDENTS
NOT
THEM
THEY
WERE
HIT
AND
MY
COUSIN
IS
STILL
RECOVERING
NO
I
CANT
TAKE
BACK
WHAT
HAPPENED
YES
IT
WAS
STUPID
BUT
BY
REMINDING
ME
ABOUT
IT
ALL
THE
TIME
YOURE
NEITHER
HELPING
ME
OR
YOURSELF
SO
STUFF
YOUR
OPINION
HEY
MAN
YOU
BROUGHT
IT
UP
I
AGREE
COMPLETELY
DRIVING
DRUNK
IS
REALLY
STUPID
AND
I
UNDERSTAND
AND
APPRECIATE
THAT
YOU
FEEL
BAD
ABOUT
IT
BUT
DWI
IS
ENDEMIC
IN
OUR
SOCIETY
IT
IS
A
REAL
PROBLEM
AND
WE
AS
MOTORCYCLISTS
CAN
BE
IN
THE
WORST
OF
VULNERABLE
POSITIONS
AROUND
A
DRUNK
DRIVER
ALERT
READERS
MIGHT
REMEMBER
THAT
LAST
YEAR
I
WITNESSED
A
DWI
ACCIDENT
RIGHT
BLOODY
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
AND
WAS
UNABLE
TO
SAVE
THE
LIFE
OF
ONE
OF
THE
PARTICIPANTS
AS
I
REPORTED
HERE
ALSO
DRUNK
DRIVING
BY
MOTORCYCLISTS
IS
A
PRIME
CAUSE
OF
THEIR
INJURY
AND
DEATH
WHICH
RAISES
THE
INSURANCE
RATES
FORCES
STUPIDLY
RESTRICTIVE
LAWS
AND
TURNS
THE
PUBLIC
AGAINST
THOSE
OF
US
WHO
RIDE
RESPONSIBLY
IN
MY
VIEW
DRUNK
DRIVING
SHOULD
CARRY
A
MANDATORY
PRISON
SENTENCE
IT
IS
ONE
OF
THE
TRAFFIC
OFFENSES
WHICH
IS
NOT
A
PUBLIC
FUNDS
ISSUE
BUT
A
GENUINE
SAFETY
ISSUE
SO
IF
YOU
BRING
UP
THE
SUBJECT
ON
RECMOTO
ADMITTING
HAVING
BEEN
CAUGHT
DWI
AND
LOOKING
FOR
SYMPATHY
OVER
THE
CONSEQUENCES
DONT
EXPECT
PEOPLE
TO
RESPOND
WITH
WARM
WISHES
