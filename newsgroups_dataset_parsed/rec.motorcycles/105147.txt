mike

ive
seen
em
but
the
real
question
is
can
one
do
a
wheelie
on
a
lead
wing
if
so
how
high
would
the
front
wheel
be
off
the
ground
wheelies
on
lead
wings
are
possible
but
they
aint
easy
or
so
my
hhmmm
what
is
the
relation
great
uncle
several
times
removed
tells
me
as
for
how
high
how
high
do
you
want
em
modulation
isnt
exactly
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
or
so
says
a
guy
years
old
well
apparently
once
you
get
past
about
inches
all
the
luggage
shifts
back
in
the
panniers
the
passenger
slides
back
and
the
dog
ends
up
hanging
onto
the
top
rack
and
they
go
all
the
way
over
until
its
flat
on
its
ass
with
the
front
wheel
straight
up
in
the
sky
impressive
but
hard
on
the
tail
