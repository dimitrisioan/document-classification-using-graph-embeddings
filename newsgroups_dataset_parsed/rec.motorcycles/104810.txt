re
need
advice
for
riding
with
someone
on
pillion
a
few
random
thoughts
on
riding
with
a
passenger
theres
no
substitute
for
a
bike
with
sufficient
power
having
taken
passengers
very
occasionally
on
the
small
etc
bikes
i
used
to
ride
in
the
uk
it
was
hard
im
now
riding
a
and
thats
great
even
moving
from
my
freinds
i
was
riding
recently
this
may
be
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
neither
i
nor
my
regular
passengers
are
particularly
slimline
i
always
tell
passengers
stay
in
line
with
the
bike
on
corners
that
makes
their
movements
predictable
my
regular
passengers
both
tend
to
hold
either
the
rack
or
nothing
at
all
i
dont
really
like
having
a
passenger
hold
onto
me
except
for
short
periods
again
that
may
be
biased
by
the
fact
that
ive
had
a
couple
of
new
passengers
a
friend
recently
for
her
first
time
on
a
bike
who
hold
on
to
me
real
tight
making
any
kind
of
maneuvering
difficult
ive
also
discovered
that
on
longer
trips
i
prefer
a
passenger
who
moves
and
shifts
their
weight
a
bit
i
recently
took
a
work
collegue
to
a
meeting
about
a
hour
ride
and
he
sat
totally
still
the
whole
way
which
left
me
also
sitting
very
still
and
getting
a
sore
back
we
have
a
code
system
for
turns
stop
and
for
i
need
to
shift
position
