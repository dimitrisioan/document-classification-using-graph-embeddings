RE
NEED
ADVICE
FOR
RIDING
WITH
SOMEONE
ON
PILLION
A
FEW
RANDOM
THOUGHTS
ON
RIDING
WITH
A
PASSENGER
THERES
NO
SUBSTITUTE
FOR
A
BIKE
WITH
SUFFICIENT
POWER
HAVING
TAKEN
PASSENGERS
VERY
OCCASIONALLY
ON
THE
SMALL
ETC
BIKES
I
USED
TO
RIDE
IN
THE
UK
IT
WAS
HARD
IM
NOW
RIDING
A
AND
THATS
GREAT
EVEN
MOVING
FROM
MY
FREINDS
I
WAS
RIDING
RECENTLY
THIS
MAY
BE
DUE
IN
PART
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
NEITHER
I
NOR
MY
REGULAR
PASSENGERS
ARE
PARTICULARLY
SLIMLINE
I
ALWAYS
TELL
PASSENGERS
STAY
IN
LINE
WITH
THE
BIKE
ON
CORNERS
THAT
MAKES
THEIR
MOVEMENTS
PREDICTABLE
MY
REGULAR
PASSENGERS
BOTH
TEND
TO
HOLD
EITHER
THE
RACK
OR
NOTHING
AT
ALL
I
DONT
REALLY
LIKE
HAVING
A
PASSENGER
HOLD
ONTO
ME
EXCEPT
FOR
SHORT
PERIODS
AGAIN
THAT
MAY
BE
BIASED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
IVE
HAD
A
COUPLE
OF
NEW
PASSENGERS
A
FRIEND
RECENTLY
FOR
HER
FIRST
TIME
ON
A
BIKE
WHO
HOLD
ON
TO
ME
REAL
TIGHT
MAKING
ANY
KIND
OF
MANEUVERING
DIFFICULT
IVE
ALSO
DISCOVERED
THAT
ON
LONGER
TRIPS
I
PREFER
A
PASSENGER
WHO
MOVES
AND
SHIFTS
THEIR
WEIGHT
A
BIT
I
RECENTLY
TOOK
A
WORK
COLLEGUE
TO
A
MEETING
ABOUT
A
HOUR
RIDE
AND
HE
SAT
TOTALLY
STILL
THE
WHOLE
WAY
WHICH
LEFT
ME
ALSO
SITTING
VERY
STILL
AND
GETTING
A
SORE
BACK
WE
HAVE
A
CODE
SYSTEM
FOR
TURNS
STOP
AND
FOR
I
NEED
TO
SHIFT
