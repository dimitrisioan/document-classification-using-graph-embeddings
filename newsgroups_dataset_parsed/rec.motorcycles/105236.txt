REMINDS
ME
OF
A
GREAT
EDITORIAL
BY
BRUCE
REEVE
A
COUPLE
MONTHS
AGO
IN
CYCLE
CANADA
HE
WAS
SO
PISSED
OFF
WITH
COPS
PULLING
OVER
SPEEDERS
IN
DANGEROUS
SPOTS
AND
OFTEN
BLIND
CORNERS
THAT
ONE
DAY
HE
DECIDED
TO
GET
REVENGE
CRUISING
ON
A
FACTORY
LOANER
TEST
BIKE
HE
NOTICED
A
COP
HAD
PULLED
OVER
A
MOTORIST
ON
AN
ON
OR
OFF
RAMP
WITH
ALMOST
NO
SHOULDER
BEING
A
BRIGHT
LAD
HE
HIT
HIS

JUST
BEFORE

THE
COP
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
BE
BENDING
TOWARDS
THE
OFFENDING

THEREBY
EXPOSING
HIS
GLUTES
TO
THE

WORLD
WITH
HIS
IGNITION
SYSTEM
NOW
DEAD
HE
PUMPED
HIS
THROTLE
TWO
OR
THREE
TIMES
TO
FILL
HIS
EXHAUST
CANISTERS
WITH
VOLATILE
RAW

ALL
IT
TOOK
WAS
A
STAB
AT
THE
KILL
SWITCH
TO
RELIGHT
THE
IGNITION
AND
SEND
A
FLAME
IN
SARGEANT

I
WONDER
IF
ANY

ALTHOUGH
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
ACTION
I
DO
HOPE
THAT
THE
RIDER
PONIED
UP
THE
OR
SO
IT
TAKES
TO
REPLACE
THE
EXHAUST

HE
JUST
DESTROYED
THE

MANUAL
EXPLICITLY
WARNS
AGAINST
SUCH
BEHAVIOR
FOR
EXACTLY
THAT
REASON
YOU
CAN
DESTROY
YOUR
