FORMAL
TRAINING
IS
IN
MY
VIEW
ABSOLUTELY
ESSENTIAL
IF
YOURE
GOING
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
RIDE
A
BIKE
PROPERLY
AND
SAFELY
BUT
BY
INCLUDING
COUNTERSTEERING
THEORY
IN
NEWBIE
COURSES
WE
ARE
CONFUSING
PEOPLE
UNNECESSARILY
RIGHT
AT
THE
TIME
WHEN
THERE
ARE
FAR
MORE
IMPORTANT
MATTERS
FOR
THEM
TO
LEARN
AND
THAT
WAS
MY
ORIGINAL
POINT
MIKE
WHILE
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
ON
THAT
FORMAL
TRAINING
IS
ESSENTIAL
FOR
SAFE
RIDING
I
DISAGREE
STRONGLY
WITH
YOUR
ORIGINAL
POINT
THE
POINT
OF
FORMAL
TRAINING
MUST
BE
TO
PREPARE
RIDERS
FOR
THE
ROAD
PREPAREDNESS
IS
IN
MY
OPINION
TO
KNOW
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
SO
TO
EXCLUDE
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
RIDING
A
BIKE
IN
A
COURSE
IS
WRONG
IMHO
NOW
TO
COUNTERSTEERING
IN
PARTICULAR
COUNTERSTEERING
IS
SOMETHING
THAT
MUST
BE
TRAINED
A
COMMON
REACTION
AMONG
NEW
BIKERS
OR
BICYCLE
RIDERS
IN
AN
EMERGENCY
SITUATION
IS
TO
STEER
THE
MOTORCYCLE
LIKE
A
BICYCLE
AS
WE
KNOW
THIS
MAKES
THE
MOTORCYCLE
GO
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OPPOSITE
TO
WHAT
WAS
INTENDED
NEEDLESS
TO
SAY
THIS
IS
DANGEROUS
I
HAVE
A
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLE
A
RIDER
IN
A
LEFT
TURN
THE
RIDER
THINKS
HESHE
IS
TO
CLOSE
TO
THE
RIGHT
SHOULDER
OF
THE
ROAD
AND
TRIES
TO
STEER
THE
MOTORCYCLE
TO
THE
LEFT
BY
PULLING
THE
LEFT
HANDLE
AND
PUSHING
THE
RIGHT
HANDLE
THE
MOTORCYCLE
STRAIGHTENS
UP
AND
GOES
OFF
THE
ROAD
A
WORSE
SCENARIO
THE
SAME
RIDER
SAME
TURN
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
TURN
THE
RIDER
SEES
A
TRUCK
COMING
TOWARDS
HIMHER
THE
PANICKING
RIDER
TRIES
TO
STEER
THE
MOTORCYCLE
AWAY
FROM
THE
TRUCK
AND
CRASHES
RIGHT
INTO
IT
THE
MAIN
FUNCTION
OF
A
RIDING
COURSE
IS
TO
TEACH
HOW
TO
AVOID
EMERGENCY
SITUATIONS
AND
WHAT
TO
DO
IF
IN
ONE
THUS
THE
KNOWLEDGE
AND
TRAINING
OF
COUNTERSTEERING
IS
IMHO
A
MUST
IN
ANY
RIDING
COURSE
