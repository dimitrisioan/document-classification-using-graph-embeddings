SWITCH
YOUR
HANDS
TO
THE
GUARDRAIL
TO
STRETCH
YOUR
SHOULDERS
BUT
BE
SURE
AND
SQUEEZE
YOUR
THIGHS
WHILE
YOURE
DOING
IT
SO
YOUR
RIDER
KNOWS
YOURE
STILL
THERE
THE
GUARD
RAIL
ISNT
AS
SAFE
AS
HOLDING
ONTO
YOUR
RIDER
HMMMM
WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
ON
THAT
SIDE
OF
THE
POND
SEEM
TO
WANT
PILLIONS
TO
HANG
ON
TO
THE
RIDER
RATHER
THAN
THE
GRABRAIL
BECAUSE
IM
A
GUY
AND
MOST
OF
MY
PILLIONS
ARE
FEMALE
ALSO
THE
OTHER
REASONS
LIKE
HAVING
AN
IDEA
WHERE
YOU
PASSENGERS
WEIGHT
IS
IT
BEING
A
MORE
COMFORTABLE
POSITION
FOR
THE
PASSENGER
AND
IT
BEING
A
MORE
STABLE
CONFIGURATION
ALL
COME
INTO
IT
AS
WELL
HOLDING
THE
GRAB
RAIL
IS
A
GREAT
IDEA
ONLY
FOR
BRAKING
WHEN
YOU
DONT
WANT
THE
PILLION
TO
SLIDE
FORWARD
INTO
YOU
OTHERWISE
I
DONT
FIND
IT
WORKS
WELL
