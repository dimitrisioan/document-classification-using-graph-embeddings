TWO
BEEMER
QUESTIONS
HELLO
FOLKS
IM
VERY
HAPPY
WITH
MY
NEW
MY
RANGE
IS
MILES
ON
GALLONS
THATS
MPG
SURPRISINGLY
THE
BIKE
IS
A
REAL
CRUISER
I
WAS
EXPECTING
SOMETHING
ROUGH
SHES
A
SWEET
BACKROAD
HONEY
AND
I
CAN
GO
PRETTY
MUCH
ANYPLACE
ID
TAKE
MY
MOUNTAIN
BIKE
AS
FAR
AS
SHAFT
EFFECT
ITS
MORE
A
TORQUE
EFFECT
FROM
THE
CRANKSHAFT
IN
MY
OPINION
REV
IT
SITTING
STILL
WHEN
THE
DRIVESHAFT
IS
NOT
MOVING
AND
THE
BIKE
TWISTS
A
BIT
MAYBE
I
DONT
RIDE
HER
FAST
ENOUGH
TO
GET
A
SHAFT
EFFECT
BUT
IN
MY
OPINION
A
LITTLE
BUFFETING
BY
WIND
IS
OF
FAR
GREATER
CONSEQUENCE
OKAY
HERE
ARE
MY
QUESTIONS
ANY
RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
A
HOMEMADE
FAIRING
ID
LIKE
TO
KEEP
THE
WIND
OFF
MY
CHEST
AND
PERHAPS
MY
HELMET
FOR
COMFORT
AT
HIGHWAY
SPEEDS
MPH
YET
DONT
WANT
TO
A
SCREW
UP
THE
STABILITY
OR
B
BLOCK
MY
VISION
TOO
MUCH
FOR
TRAIL
RIDING
ANYBODY
HAVE
LUCK
WITH
TWOPIECE
DETACHIBLE
FAIRINGS
ID
LIKE
TO
MAKE
IT
MYSELF
OUT
OF
PLEXIGLAS
I
RUN
TWO
LIGHTS
THE
STANDARD
HEADLAMP
PLUS
A
SIDELAMP
MOUNTED
ON
THE
CRASH
BAR
THE
ILLUMINATIONS
EXCELLENT
THAT
WAY
WITH
A
FULL
BEAM
COMING
OUT
FROM
THE
LEVEL
OF
THE
MOTOR
LEFT
SIDE
THE
LAMP
BEAM
IS
LINEAR
SO
THAT
YOU
GET
A
BRIGHT
STREAK
OF
ILLUMINATION
FROM
LEFT
TO
RIGHT
AND
IT
REALLY
PICKS
UP
THE
PERIPHERY
DEER
LURKING
ETC
COMBINED
WITH
THE
HEADLAMP
ON
HIGH
YOU
CAN
SEE
LIKE
DAY
BUT
IVE
HEARD
THAT
BMW

CRANK
OUT
TOO
MUCH
DO
I
NEED
TO
SHUT
DOWN

IS
EMBARASSING
IM
