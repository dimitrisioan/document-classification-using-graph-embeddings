NEW
TO
MOTORCYCLES
HELLO
EVERYONE
IM
NEW
TO
MOTORCYCLES
SO
NO
FLAMES
PLEASE
I
DONT
HAVE
MY
BIKE
YET
SO
I
NEED
A
FEW
PIECES
OF
INFORMATION
I
ONLY
HAVE
ABOUT
TO
WORK
WITH
SO
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
COVER
EVERYTHING
BIKE
HELMET
ANYTHING
ELSE
THAT
IM
TOO
IGNORANT
TO
KNOW
I
NEED
TO
BUY
WHAT
IS
BUYING
A
BIKE
GOING
TO
DO
TO
MY
INSURANCE
I
TURN
IN
ABOUT
A
MONTH
SO
MY
PARENTS
HAVE
BEEN
TAKING
CARE
OF
MY
INSURANCE
UP
TILL
NOW
AND
I
NEED
A
COMPREHENSIVE
LIST
OF
COSTS
THAT
BUYING
A
MOTORCYCLE
IS
GOING
TO
INSURE
I
LIVE
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
IF
THAT
MAKES
A
DIFFERENCE
ANY
RECOMMENDATIONS
ON
WHAT
I
SHOULD
BUYWHERE
I
SHOULD
LOOK
FOR
IT
IN
DC
AS
I
IMAGINE
IT
IS
IN
EVERY
OTHER
STATE
OK
OK
WERE
NOT
A
STATE
WERE
NOT
BITTER
YOU
TAKE
THE
WRITTEN
TEST
FIRST
AND
THEN
GET
A
LEARNERS
PERMIT
HOWEVER
IM
WONDERING
HOW
ONE
GOES
ABOUT
LEARNING
TO
RIDE
THE
BIKE
PROFICIENTLY
ENOUGH
SO
AS
TO
A
GET
A
LISCENCE
AND
B
NOT
KILL
ONESELF
I
DONT
KNOW
ANYONE
WITH
A
BIKE
WHO
COULD
TEACH
ME
AND
THE
MOST
ADVICE
IVE
HEARD
IS
EITHER
DO
YOU
LIVE
NEAR
A
FIELD
OR
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
FRIEND
WITH
A
PICKUP
TRUCK
THE
ANSWERS
TO
BOTH
OF
WHICH
ARE
NO
DO
I
JUST
RIDE
AROUND
MY
NEIGHBORHOOD
AND
HOPE
FOR
THE
BEST
I
KIND
OF
LIVE
IN
A
RESIDENTIAL
AREA
BUT
ITS
NOT
SUBURBS
ITS
STILL
THE
BIG
CITY
AND
IM
ABOUT
A
MILE
FROM
DOWNTOWN
SO
THAT
DOESNT
SEEM
TOO
VIABLE
ANY
STORIES
ON
HOW
YOU
ALL
LEARNED
THANKS
FOR
ANY
REPLIES
IN
ADVANCE
