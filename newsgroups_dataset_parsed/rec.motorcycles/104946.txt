hello
all
on
my
bike
i
have
hazard
lights
both
front
and
back
turn
signals
flash
since
i
live
in
nj
and
commute
to
nyc
there
are
a
number
of
tolls
one
must
pay
on
route
just
before
arriving
at
a
toll
booth
i
switch
the
hazards
on
i
do
thisto
warn
other
motorists
that
i
will
be
taking
longer
than
the
seconds
to
make
the
transaction
taking
gloves
off
getting
money
out
of
coin
changerpocket
making
transaction
putting
gloves
back
on
takes
a
little
more
time
than
the
average
cager
takes
to
make
the
same
transaction
of
paying
the
toll
i
also
notice
that
when
i
do
this
cagers
tend
to
get
the
message
and
usually
go
to
another
booth
my
question
is
this
a
goodbad
thing
to
do
any
others
tend
to
do
the
same
just
curious

considered
eliminating
tolls
for

based
simply
on
the
fact
that

clog
up

the

of
