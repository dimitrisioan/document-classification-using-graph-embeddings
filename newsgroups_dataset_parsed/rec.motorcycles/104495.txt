IN
FRONT
OF
TRAFFIC
JERKS
NMMTHE
OTHER
DAY
IT
WAS
RAINING
CATS
AND
DOGS
THEREFOR
I
WAS
GOING
ONLY
TO
NMMTHE
SPEED
LIMIT
ON
NOTHING

ON
MY
BIKE
THIS
GUY
IN
HIS

AT
THE
NEXT
RED
LIGHT
I
NMMCALMLY

THE
BIKE

WALKED
BACK

ROLLED
DOWN
THE

HE
COULD
HAVE
RUN
OVER
YOUR
BIKE

JUST
BEAT

CONSIDER
THAT
THE
PERSON
IS
FOOLISH
ENOUGH
TO
DRIVE
LIKE
A
FOOL
AND
MAY
VERY
WELL
ACT
LIKE
ONE
TOO
JUST
GET
THE
HECK
AWAY
FROM
THE
IDIOT
IF
THE
DRIVER
DOES
SOMETHING
CLEARLY
ILLEGAL
YOU
CAN
FILE
A
CITIZENS
ARREST
AND
DRAG
THAT
PERSON
INTO
COURT
ITS
A
HASSLE
FOR
YOU
BUT
A
MAJOR
HASSLE
FOR
THE
PERP
