how
to
act
in
front
of
traffic
jerks
nmmthe
other
day
it
was
raining
cats
and
dogs
therefor
i
was
going
only
to
nmmthe
speed
limit
on
nothing
more
on
my
bike
this
guy
in
his
bmw
was
nmmdriving
meters
behind
me
for
meters
and
at
the
next
red
light
i
nmmcalmly
put
the
bike
on
its
leg
walked
back
to
this
car
he
rolled
down
the
nmmwindow
and
i
told
him
he
was
a
total
idiot
and
the
reason
why
nmmdid
i
do
the
right
thing
imho
you
did
the
wrong
thing
you
could
have
been
shot
or
he
could
have
run
over
your
bike
or
just
beat
the
shit
out
of
you
consider
that
the
person
is
foolish
enough
to
drive
like
a
fool
and
may
very
well
act
like
one
too
just
get
the
heck
away
from
the
idiot
if
the
driver
does
something
clearly
illegal
you
can
file
a
citizens
arrest
and
drag
that
person
into
court
its
a
hassle
for
you
but
a
major
hassle
for
the
perp
