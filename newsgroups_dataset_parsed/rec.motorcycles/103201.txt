i
thought
it
was
an
a
hawk
modified
by
two
brothers
racing
but
i
did
not
think
that
they
made
this
huge
tank
for
it
additionally
i
think
ive
seen
this
bike
is
it
all
white
with
a
seagreen
stripe
and
just
honda
for
decals
ive
seen
such
a
bike
numerous
times
over
by
sewall
hall
at
cu
and
i
thought
it
was
a
raceprepped
cbr
i
didnt
see
it
over
at
the
ec
parking
lot
i
buzzed
over
there
on
my
way
home
all
of
block
off
my
route
but
it
was
gone
is
a
single
sided
swingarm
available
for
the
cbr
i
would
imagine
so
kinda
neccisary
for
quick
tire
changes
when
i
first
saw
it
i
assumed
it
was
a
bike
repainted
to
cover
crash
damage
