JODY
LEVINE
WRITES
SO
THE
QUESTION
I
HAVE
IS
HOW
DANGEROUS
IS
RIDING
ITS
EXACTLY
AS
DANGEROUS
AS
IT
LOOKS
YOURE
HARD
TO
SEE
AND
HAVE
LITTLE
PROTECTION
KEEPING
OUT
OF
TROUBLE
MEANS
KNOWING
YOUR
LIMITS
KEEPING
YOUR
MACHINE
IN
GOOD
SHAPE
AND
BEING
ABLE
TO
PREDICT
AND
MAKE
UP
FOR
EVERY
STUPID
MOVE
THAT
DRIVERS
MAKE
OUT
THERE
WE
DEAL
WITH
IT
BECAUSE
ITS
FUN
BUT
STAYING
ALIVE
TAKES
A
CONSCIOUS
EFFORT
IVE
BIKE
LIKE

SEEN

SUMMED
UP
SO
SUCCINCTLY
BEFORE
I
MIGHT
ONLY
ADD
TWO
THINGS
STUPID
ROAD
DESIGN
OR
POOR
AT
LEAST
AND
WE
DEAL
WITH
IT
FOR
THE
FUN
AND
BROTHERHOOD
WE
SHARE
WITH
OTHERS
WHO
TAKE
THEIR
LIVES
IN
THEIR
HADS
TO
FEEL
THE
WIND
IN
THEIR
