BLACK
REFLECTOR
TAPE
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
IN
ONE
THE
THE
MOTORCYCLE
MAGS
THERE
WAS
AN
ARTICLE
THAT
MENTIONED
REFLECTOR
TAPE
THAT
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
AVAILABLE
THRU
BMW
THE
IDEA
WAS
THAT
THE
TAPE
WOULD
LOOK
BLACK
IN
SUNLIGHT
AND
REFLECT
IN
OTHER
COLORS
AT
NIGHT
TO
HEADLIGHTS
IT
SOUNDED
LIKE
A
NICE
WAY
TO
ADD
NIGHTTIME
VISIBILITY
WITHOUT
TURNING
THE
BIKE
INTO
A
CARNIVAL
ATTRACTION
I
TALKED
TO
THE
LOCAL
BMW
DEALER
ABOUT
THIS
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THE
ONLY
THING
HE
HAD
HEARD
ABOUT
THIS
KIND
OF
REFLECTOR
WAS
IT
BEING
USED
IN
A
COMING
LINE
OF
BMW
CLOTHING
RAINSUITS
HE
WASNT
AWARE
OF
ANYTHING
REGARDING
SELF
APPLIED
TAPE
HAS
ANYONE
COME
ACROSS
THIS
FROM
BMW
OR
ANY
OTHER
SOURCE
