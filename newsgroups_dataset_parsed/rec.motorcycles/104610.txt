issue
on

great
party
mixer
the
neo
synthetic
oil
company
has
a
reputation
for
developing
overkill
priducts
the
protect
and
extend
the
life
of
mechinical
things
and
here
is
there
latest
development
propylene
glycol
probably
the
finest
radiator
coolant
available
after
miles
of
testing
they
find
it
has
a
boiling
point
of
degrees
much
higher
than
conventional
coolants
which
helps
elminate
detonation
and
pinging
it
allows
the
use
of
smaller
radiators
in
race
cars
it
will
not
damage
aluminum
blocks
or
heads
and
it
is
environmentally
safe
yep

good
