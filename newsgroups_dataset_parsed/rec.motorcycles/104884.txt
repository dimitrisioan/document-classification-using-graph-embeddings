i
am
looking
for
a
new
tank
bag
now
and
i
wondered
if
you
as
follow
owners
could
make
some
suggestions
as
to
what
has
and
has
with
the
fjs
large
flat
gas
tank
id
imagine
that
almost
anything
would
work
personally
im
quite
happy
with
my
eclipse
standard
tank
bag
i
think
the
only
thing
to
watch
for
is
the
number
of
attachment
straps
most
come
with
and
some
with
i
have
a
bagman
strap
tankbag
and
because
the
rear
of
the
tank
is
so
narrow
the
fit
is
not
optimal
good
point
id
overlooked
that
the
eclipse
has
a
point
mount
at
the
rear
and
at
the
front
and
its
very
stable
on
the
fj
i
have
seen
some
with
harnesses
that
mount
to
the
sides
of
the
tank
and
that
would
be
a
real
problem
on
the
fj
