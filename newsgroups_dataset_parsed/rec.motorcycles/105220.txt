sorry
for
my
stupid
question
but
what
do
you
americans
mean
with
shaftdrives
my
dictionary
knows
only
strange
meanings
like
schaft
stiel
pfeil
strahl
welle
deichsel
schacht
shaft
bamboozle
beat
beguile
burn
or
flame
deceive
hoax
hoodwink
drive
campaign
crusade
push
so
shaft
drive
may
be
a
campaign
to
decieve
or
a
crusade
of
beguile
efforts
where
are
true
to
the
spirit
of
this
list
wheel
revolution
swing
crusaders
of
beguile
are
innefective
in
revolutions
and
they
cannot
swing
either
therefore
shaft
drives
cannot
do
wheelies
