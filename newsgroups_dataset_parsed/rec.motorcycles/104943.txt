TRIANGULATION
OF
TARGET
THEN
TAKE
OFF
AND
LAUGH
AT
THE
DOG
NOW
FAR
BEHIND
YOU
THIS
TIME
IT
DIDNT
WORK
BECAUSE
I
DIDNT
HAVE
TIME
RIDING
UP
THE
HILL
LEADING
TO
MY
HOUSE
I
ENCOUNTERED
A
LIVERANDWHITE
SPRINGER
SPANIEL
NO
RELATION
TO
THE
SPRINGER
SOFTAIL
OR
THE
SPRINGER
SPAGTHORPE
A
CLOSE
RELATION
TO
THE
SPAGTHORPE
VIKING
ACTUALLY
THE
DOG
ENCOUNTERED
ME
WITH
INTENT
TO
HARM
BUT
I
DIGRESS
I
WAS
RIDING
NEAR
THE
UNPAINTED
CENTERLINE
OF
THE
ROUGHLY
WIDE
ROAD
DOING
BETWEEN
FORTY
AND
SIXTY
CLICKS
MPH
FOR
THE
VELOCITYIMPAIRED
THE
DOG
SHOT
AT
ME
FROM
BEHIND
BUSHES
ON
THE
LEFT
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
AT
AN
IMPOSSIBLY
HIGH
SPEED
I
LATER
LEARNED
HE
HAD
BEEN
ACCELERATING
FROM
THE
FRONT
PORCH
ABOUT
THIRTY
FEET
AWAY
HEADING
DOWN
THE
VERY
GENTLY
SLOPED
APPROACH
TO
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
I
SAW
THE
DOG
AND
BEFORE
YOU
COULD
SAY
SIPDE
HE
WAS
ON
ME
BOOM
I
TOOK
THE
DOG
IN
THE
LEFT
LEG
AND
FROM
THE
MARKS
ON
THE
BIKE
MY
LEG
WAS
DRIVEN
UP
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BIKE
WITH
CONSIDERABLE
FORCE
MAKING
PERMANENT
MARKS
ON
THE
PLASTIC
PARTS
OF
THE
BIKE
AND
CRACKING
ONE
PANEL
I
THINK
I
SAW
THE
DOG
SPIN
AROUND
WHEN
I
LOOKED
BACK
BUT
MY
MEMORY
OF
THIS
MOMENT
IS
HAZY
I
NEXT
TURNED
AROUND
AND
PICKED
THE
MOST
LIKELY
LOOKING
HOUSE
THE
APOLOGETIC
WOMAN
EXPLAINED
THAT
THE
DOG
WAS
NOT
SERIOUSLY
HURT
CUT
MOUTH
AND
HOPED
I
WAS
NOT
HURT
EITHER
I
COULD
FEEL
THE
PAIN
IN
MY
SHIN
AND
EXPECTED
A
COOL
PURPLE
WELT
TO
FORM
SOON
SADLY
IT
HAS
NOT
SO
IM
LEFT
WITH
A
TENDER
SHIN
AND
NO
COOL
BATTLE
SCARS
INTERESTINGLY
THE
ONE
THING
THAT
NEVER
HAPPENED
WAS
THAT
THE
BIKE
NEVER
MOVED
OFF
COURSE
THE
NOT
INCONSIDERABLE
IMPACT
DID
NOT
PUSH
THE
BIKE
OFF
COURSE
NOR
DID
IT
CAUSE
ME
TO
PUT
THE
BIKE
OUT
OF
CONTROL
FROM
SOME
GUT
REACTION
TO
THE
SUDDEN
IMPACT
DELAYED
PAIN
MAY
HAVE
HELPED
ME
HERE
AS
I
DIDNT
FEEL
A
SUDDEN
SHARP
PAIN
THAT
I
CAN
REMEMBER
WHAT
WORRIES
ME
ABOUT
THE
ACCIDENT
IS
THIS
I
DONT
THINK
I
COULD
HAVE
PREVENTED
IT
EXCEPT
BY
TRAVELING
MUCH
SLOWER
THAN
I
WAS
THIS
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
AN
UNREASONABLE
SUGGESTION
FOR
A
RESIDENTIAL
AREA
BUT
I
WAS
RIDING
AROUND
THE
SPEED
LIMIT
I
WORRY
ABOUT
WHAT
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
IF
IT
HAD
BEEN
A
CAR
INSTEAD
OF
A
DOG
BUT
I
CONSOLE
MYSELF
WITH
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
IT
WOULD
TAKE
A
TRULY
INSANE
BDI
CAGER
TO
WHIP
OUT
OF
A
BLIND
DRIVEWAY
AT
MPH
FOR
THAT
MATTER
HOW
MANY
DRIVEWAYS
ARE
LONG
ENOUGH
FOR
A
CAR
TO
HIT
MPH
BY
THE
END
