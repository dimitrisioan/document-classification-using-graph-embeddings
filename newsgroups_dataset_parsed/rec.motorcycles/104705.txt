re
question
about
helmets
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
i
owned
a
bieffe
offroad
helmet
took
what
i
would
consider
a
minor
fall
and
had
visible
damage
to
the
shell
yes
the
helmet
did
its
job
but
the
damageimpact
ratio
was
scary
i
own
bell
now
have
taken
impacts
on
order
of
twice
the
bieffe
impact
we
do
this
frequently
in
mx
and
dont
even
have
a
scratch
on
it
after
two
seasons
my
recommendation
is
to
buy
high
quality
gear
ymmv
