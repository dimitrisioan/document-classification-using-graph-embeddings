NOW
I
AM
JUMPING
INTO
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THIS
THREAD
SO
I
MAY
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
YALL
BEEN
TALKING
ABOUT
BUT
I
HAVE
A
FEW
COMMENTS
IN

WRITES
UNLESS
AN
ENGINE
IS
SUPERCHARGED
THE
PRESSURE
AVAILABLE
TO
FORCE
AIR
INTO
THE
INTAKE
TRACT
IS
ATMOSPHERIC
AT
THE
TIME
THE
INTAKE
VALVE
IS
OPENED
THE
PRESSURE
DIFFERENTIAL
AVAILABLE
TO
MOVE
AIR
IS
ONLY
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
COMBUSTION
CHAMBER
PRESSURE
LEFT
OVER
AFTER
THE
EXHAUST
STROKE
AND
ATMOSPHERIC
AS
THE
PISTON
DECENDS
ON
THE
INTAKE
STROKE
COMBUSTION
CHAMBER
PRESSURE
IS
DECREASED
ALLOWING
ATMOSPHERIC
PRESSURE
TO
MOVE
MORE
AIR
INTO
THE
INTAKE
TRACT
AT
NO
TIME
DOES
THE
PRESSURE
EVER
BECOME
NEGATIVE
OR
EVEN
APPROACH
A
GOOD
VACUUM
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
FACTORS
THAT
ARE
VERY
IMPORTANT
THE
THREE
BIGGEST

AIR

AIR

SHOCK
WAVES

STACKS
HAVE
BEEN
USED
FOR
YEARS
AND
ARE
NOW
BEING
USED
INSIDE

AIRBOXES
ON
A
NUMBER
OF

AT
A

RPM
THE
STACKS
CAN
GREATLY
INCREASE
THE

AND
THUS
MOMENTUM
OF
THE

RUSHING
IN

MOMENTUM
IS
CRITICAL
IN
GETTING
GOOD
AIR
INTAKE
THE
MOMENTUM
OF
THE

WILL
FORCE
ITS

WAVES
ARE
USED
TO
INDUCE

AND
TO

WAVES
ARE
THE

OF

ANY
OTHER
MEANS
OF

I
AM
LOST
IN
THE
