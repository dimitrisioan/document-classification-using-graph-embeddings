MY
SOLUTION
IS
NEVER
TO
RIDE
NEXT
TO
A
CAR
THE
ONLY
THING
BETWEEN
YOU
AND
THEM
IS
SPACE
KEEP
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
TAKE
THIS
ONE
STEP
FURTHER
NEVER
DILLYDALLY
IN
THAT
REAR
OF
EITHER
SIDE
OF
A
CAGE
WHEN
YOU
PASS
MAKE
IT
AS
POSITIVE
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
IF
YOU
CANT
PASS
FULLY
AT
LEAST
MAKE
SURE
THAT
IF
YOU
ATTEMPT
IT
YOU
CAN
MAKE
THE
DRIVER
AWARE
OF
YOU
BY
AT
LEAST
GETTING
INTO
HIS
AREA
OF
VISION
THIS
ALSO
APPLIES
TO
MERGING
INTO
ANOTHER
LANE
AFTER
MAKING
A
PASS
DO
IT
AS
POSITIVELY
AS
POSSIBLE
AND
WHAT
I
TRY
TO
DO
IS
LOOK
IN
THE
REAR
VIEW
AND
THEN
OVER
MY
SHOULDER
AND
AFTER
IVE
DONE
THAT
ACCELERATE
INTO
THE
LANE
SO
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
SPEED
CUSHION
SHOULD
YOU
HAVE
MISSED
SEEING
A
POTENTIAL
BDI
THATS
TRYING
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THING
AS
YOU
OR
WORSE
IE
HE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
BEHIND
YOU
SAW
YOU
MADE
THE
PASS
SUCCESSFULLY
BUT
YOU
ARENT
GOING
FAST
ENOUGH
TO
SUITE
HIM
SO
HE
TRIES
TO
GO
AROUND
YOU
ON
THE
RIGHT
RIDE
WITH
FOUR
EYES
