I
NEED
SOME
ADVICE
ON
HAVING
SOMEONE
RIDE
PILLION
WITH
ME
ON
MY
NINJA
THIS
WILL
BE
THE
THE
FIRST
TIME
IVE
TAKEN
ANYONE
FOR
AN
EXTENDED
RIDE
READ
FARTHER
THAN
AROUND
THE
BLOCK
WELL
BE
RIDING
SOME
TWISTY
FAIRLY
BUMPY
ROADS
THE
MINES
ROADMTHAMILTON
LOOP
FOR
YOU
SF
BAY
AREANS
UNLESS
SHE
IS
REALLY
ADVENTUROUS
DO
NOT
TAKE
HER
ON
THIS
ROUTE
FOR
HER
FIRST
EXTENDED
RIDE
THATS
KINDA
LIKE
TAKING
SOMEONE
ON
A
NOSHOW
SPEED
STAR
COMPETITION
AS
THEIR
FIRST
SKYDIVE
THIS
PERSON
IS
LBS
AND
FAIRLY
SMALL
SO
I
DONT
SEE
WEIGHT
AS
TOO
MUCH
OF
A
PROBLEM
BUT
WHAT
SORT
OF
OF
ADVICE
SHOULD
I
GIVE
HER
BEFORE
WE
GO
I
WANT
HER
TO
HOLD
ONTO
ME
RATHER
THAN
THE
GRAB
RAIL
OUT
BACK
AND
IVE
HEARD
THAT
SHE
SHOULD
LOOK
OVER
MY
SHOULDER
IN
THE
DIRECTION
WERE
TURNING
SO
SHE
LEANS
WITH
ME
BUT
WHAT
ELSE
ARE
THERE
TRADITIONAL
IF
THE
NINJA
HAS
ADJUSTABLE
SUSPENSION
ADJUST
IT
TO
A
STIFFER
SETTING
SO
YOU
DONT
BOTTOM
OUT
IN
BUMPY
CURVES
TELL
HER
THE
CARDINAL
RULES
ARE
A
NEVER
EVER
EVER
EVER
PUT
HER
FEET
DOWN
NOT
WHEN
YOU
STOP
AT
A
STOP
SIGN
NOT
WHEN
SHE
THINKS
YOURE
GONNA
CRASH
NEVER
KEEP
THEM
ON
THE
PEGS
UNTIL
YOU
TELL
HER
TO
GET
OFF
THE
BIKE
B
SHE
IS
TO
HOLD
ONTO
YOUR
WAIST
SHE
SHOULD
HOLD
ON
TIGHTLY
ENOUGH
THAT
SHE
WONT
SLIDE
OFF
THE
BIKE
IF
YOU
TWIST
THE
THROTTLE
A
BIT
AND
ADDED
BONUS
FOR
YOU
HERE
SHE
SHOULD
KEEP
AS
CLOSE
TO
YOUR
BUTT
AS
POSSIBLE
SO
QUICK
STOPS
DONT
MAKE
HER
SLIDE
INTO
YOU
AND
KNOCK
YOUR
BALLS
UP
ONTO
THE
GAS
TANK
YOU
DECIDE
HOW
BEST
TO
WORD
THIS
C
JUST
STAY
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
BIKE
STRAIGHT
UP
IN
THE
SEAT
DONT
LEAN
YOUR
BODY
INTO
CURVES
JUST
GO
WITH
THE
BIKE
AND
STAY
PERPENDICULAR
DONT
LOOK
OVER
YOUR
SHOULDER
REMEMBER
AT
ALL
TIMES
THAT
YOU
HAVE
A
PASSENGER
ON
THE
BACK
THAT
MEANS
DONT
POP
THE
CLUTCH
AND
TRY
TO
CORNER
AND
STOP
SMOOTHER
THAN
USUAL
BE
AWARE
THAT
IF
YOU
JUMP
ON
THE
BRAKE
YOURE
GOING
TO
HAVE
THE
EQUIVALENT
OF
A
LB
DEAD
WEIGHT
CRASHING
INTO
YOU
FROM
BEHIND
SO
BE
PREPARED
FOR
THAT
MAKE
SURE
SHE
PISSES
BEFORE
THE
RIDE
EVEN
IF
SHE
SAYS
SHE
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
GO
NO
ANTIWOMEN
STUFF
HERE
I
HAVE
A
TINY
BLADDER
MYSELF
REMIND
HER
TO
LOOK
AROUND
WHILE
YOURE
RIDING
POINT
TO
THINGS
OF
INTEREST
IT
MAKES
THE
RIDE
MORE
ENJOYABLE
TO
HER
SHE
WONT
GET
SO
FOCUSED
ON
JUST
LOOKING
AT
THE
BACK
OF
YOUR
HELMET
AND
IT
GIVES
HER
AMPLE
EXCUSE
TO
SQUEEZE
YOU
TO
SHOW
SHE
SAW
WHAT
YOU
POINTED
AT
MY
WIFE
AND
I
TRIED
THE
MSFRECOMMENDED
LOOK
OVER
THE
RIDERS
SHOULDER
IN
CURVES
BIT
AND
IT
JUST
DIDNT
WORK
THE
TIMING
OF
HER
WEIGHT
SHIFT
WAS
UNPREDICTABLE
ESPECIALLY
ON
THE
MAXIM
BECAUSE
UNLIKE
THE
NINJA
THE
UPRIGHT
RIDING
POSITION
REALLY
RESTRICTS
THE
PILLIONS
VIEW
OF
THE
ROAD
AHEAD
NEXT
TIME
I
HAD
HER
JUST
REMAIN
PERPENDICULAR
TO
THE
BIKE
AND
I
COULD
HARDLY
TELL
THERE
WAS
SOMEONE
ELSE
ON
THE
BIKE
IN
CURVES
AND
SHE
WEIGHS
SUBSTANTIALLY
