BRIAN
W
SIMMONS
WRITES
NOW
MAYBE
THIS
ISNT
A
BIG
DEAL
TO
SOME
OF
YOU
BUT
IT
IS
TO
ME
I
WAS
RAISED
IN
THE
SOUTH
AND
PART
OF
MY
CULTURAL
HERITAGE
IS
WAVING
AT
PASSERSBY
I
WAVED
FROM
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ROAD
AT
PASSING
CARS
WHEN
I
DROVE
I
WAVED
OR
NODDED
OR
AT
LEAST
RAISED
AN
INDEX
FINGER
FROM
THE
STEERING
WHEEL
PEOPLE
WAVED
AT
ME
AS
I
DROVE
BY
I
WAS
RAISED
IN
THE
SOUTH
AND
I
CAN
ATTEST
THAT
THIS
IS
TRUE
WHY
ON
ONE
PARTICULARLY
HOT
DAY
AS
I
WAS
WALKING
ALONG
THE
ROAD
SOME
GOOD
OLE
BOYS
IN
A
TRUCK
TOSSED
ME
A
COLD
BEER
OF
COURSE
THEY
WERE
GOING
MPH
AT
THE
TIME
PS
TO
PROVE
THIS
WASNT
A
FLUKE
IT
HAPPENED
TO
ME
AGAIN
WHEN
I
WAS
OUT
RIDING
ON
WEDNESDAY
AN
UNSOLICITED
WAVE
WOW
BIKERS
WAVE
TO
BIKERS
THE
WORLD
OVER
WHETHER
OR
NOT
HARLEY
RIDERS
WAVE
TO
OTHER
BIKERS
IS
ONE
OF
OUR
FAVORITE
FLAME
WARS
ED
GREEN
FORMER
NINJAITE
I
WAS
DRINKING
LAST
NIGHT
WITH
A
BIKER
EDGREENEASTSUNCOM
AND
I
SHOWED
HIM
A
PICTURE
OF
YOU
I
SAID
DOD
GO
ON
GET
TO
KNOW
HER
YOULL
LIKE
HER
THE
GRATEFUL
DEAD
IT
SEEMED
LIKE
THE
LEAST
I
COULD
DO
