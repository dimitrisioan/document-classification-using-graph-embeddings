sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
as
far
as
the
internet
goes
i
was
in
baghdad
while
you
were
still
in
your
dads
bag
most
of
the
people
who
made
this
group
interesting
or
years
ago
are
no
longer
around
and
i
only
have
time
to
make
a
random
sweep
once
a
week
or
so
hence
i
missed
most
of
this
thread
based
on
your
previous
postings
apparently
devoid
of
humour
sarcasm
wit
or
the
apparent
capacity
to
walk
and
chew
gum
at
the
same
time
i
assumed
you
were
serious
mea
culpa
still
its
nice
to
see
that
bnr
are
doing
so
well
that
they
can
afford
to
overpay
some
contractors
to
sit
and
read
news
all
day

most
people
prefer
entertaining
nonsense
to
unexciting
reality
