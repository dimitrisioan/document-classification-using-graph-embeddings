ive
had
people
in
cages
wave
at
me
or
give
me
the
thumbs
up
on
occassion
i
always
return
the
wave
or
thumbs
up
that
never
happened
to
me
until
i
started
riding
harleys
so
that
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
ever
notice
little
kid
wave
more
than
other
bikers
the
reactions
of
little
boys
seems
to
be
the
most
enthusiastic
to
a
wave
and
also
good
to
see
i
always
wave
when
i
see
a
kid
that
has
at
least
noticed
my
bike
i
figure
it
helps
the
future
of
the
sport
yeah
its
impossible
to
be
a
tough
biker
when
a
year
old
starts
waving
at
you
