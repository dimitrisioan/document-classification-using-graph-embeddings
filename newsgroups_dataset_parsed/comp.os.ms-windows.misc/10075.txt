by

book
bs
this
is
also
how
you
can
put
your
own
logo
into
the

startup
might
do
it
too
much
trouble
brad
bmp
will
convert
to
rle
i
know
for
a
fact
that
paintshop
shareware
from
cica
desktop
i
think
filename
psvvvzip
i
think
where
vvv
is
the
ver
number
if
thats
not
true
let
me
know
and
ill
this
however
will
write
your
rle
file
with
a
bmp
extension
so
you
have
to
rename
it
your
file
has
to
be
less
than
k
at
least
thats
what
the
faq
says
but
mine
wont
work
for
more
than
about
they
mend
i
dont
know
agreed
mixali
your
file
has
to
fit
vga
size
or
whatever
standard
vga
size
is
if
you
use
a
nonvga
screen
eg
cga
ega
svga
there
is
also
a
way
to
do
it
but
i
thing
instead
of
vgalogolgo
you
use
another
file
not
entirely
true
alsoyour
bmp
has
to
be
colours
or
less
true
finally
remember
to
save
your
current
wincom
before
and
put
your
new
wincom
in
the
windows
directory
also
dont
start
windows
from
a
unecessary
mickey
path
of
least
resistance
tm
get
wingif
from
cica
ftpcicaindianaedu
it
will
save
to
native
rle
format
unlike
psp
an
otherwise
fine
fine
prog
make
a
file
using
anything
that
has
to
be
less
than
as
michael
said
and
less
than
colors
import
it
to
wingif
as
gif
pcx
or
bmp
and
save
it
in
you
windowssystem
subdir
as
vgalogorle
not
lgo
exit
win
and
run
setup
in
the
windows
subdir
reselect
your
current
config
run
win
voila
minor
correction
the
rle
file
has
to
be
that
means
gif
hope
it
helps
and
