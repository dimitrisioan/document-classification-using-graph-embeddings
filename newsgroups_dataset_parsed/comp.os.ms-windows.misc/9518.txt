STUFF
DELETED
BE
THAT
WHAT
IT
MAY
I
WOULD
REALLY
SUGGEST
TO
EVERYONE
TO
TAKE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GO
TO
THESE
TECHNICAL
WORKSHOPS
THEY
ARENT
ACTUALLY
INCREDIBLY
INDEPTH
BUT
YOU
DO
GET
A
LOT
OF
MATERIAL
ABOUT
BUGS
AND
OPTIMIZATION
STRAIGHT
FROM
THOSE
IN
THE
KNOW
BESIDES
THAT
THEY
OFFER
YOU
HUGE
DISCOUNTS
ON
SOFTWARE
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
YOU
COULD
PICK
UP
WORD
EXCEL
OR
WHATEVER
THEIR
PRESENTATION
PROGRAM
IS
FOR
THAT
IS
THE
FULL
BLOWN
VERSION
NOT
AN
UPGRADE
OR
EDUCATIONAL
VERSION
YOU
COULD
ALSO
PICK
UP
MICROSOFT
OFFICE
FOR
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
MYSELF
I
SPRANG
FOR
WORD
THE
VALUE
OF
THESE
WORKSHOPS
ASIDE
YOU
OUGHT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BUY
FULL
COPIES
OF
ALL
THIS
SOFTWARE
THROUGH
YOUR
CAMPUS
BOOKSTORE
OR
SOFTWARE
DISTRIBUTOR
AT
THESE
RATES
IM
NOT
AWARE
THAT
THE
EDUCATIONAL
VERSION
OF
WORD
OR
EXCEL
IS
DOPED
DOWN
IN
ANY
WAY
WELL
HOPE
THAT
WAS
HELPFUL
TO
SOMEONE
AND
BESIDES
THAT
I
HOPE
SOMEONE
WILL
GO
TO
A
WORKSHOP
AND
SAVE
A
LITTLE
MONEY
AND
IF
ANYONE
AT
MICROSOFT
IS
READING
THIS
I
REALLY
LOVE
YOUR
PRODUCTS
I
NEED
A
JOB
ONCE
