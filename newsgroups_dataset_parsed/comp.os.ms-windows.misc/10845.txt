strange
windows
problem
my
windows
installation
has
somehow
gone
awry
whenever
i
try
to
run
windows
now
the
logo
comes
up
ok
but
when
it
tries
to
enter
windows
itself
the
screen
gets
totally
screwed
up
as
if
its
in
the
wrong
graphics
mode
or
something
its
completely
illegible
although
functional
as
i
can
still
exit
to
dos
with
an
alte
return
combination
i
tried
to
reinstall
windows
again
but
if
you
recall
halfway
through
the
installation
process
install
takes
you
into
windows
and
there
my
graphics
problem
surfaces
again
so
i
cannot
complete
the
reinstallation
all
this
started
after
trying
to
get
a
game
working
on
my
system
but
my
configsys
and
autoexecbat
have
been
restored
to
what
they
were
before
this
problem
cropped
up
im
running
a
with
a
diamond
stealth
vram
ive
resinstalled
the
stealth
video
drivers
again
but
with
no
luck
im
also
using
qemm
and
stacker
but
windows
is
installed
on
an
unstacked
partition
and
of
course
it
worked
perfectly
before
any
email
replies
and
suggestions
would
be
appreciated
thanks
