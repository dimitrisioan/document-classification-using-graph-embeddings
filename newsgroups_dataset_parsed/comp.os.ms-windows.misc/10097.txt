please
do
not
post
bitmaps
from
pwisemansalmonusdedu
cliff
organization
university
of
south
dakota
subject
romanbmp
response
to
the
requests
for
cool
bitmaps
i
am
posting
one
date
pm
due
to
the
resolution
and
size
it
is
in
parts
this
is
a
uuencoded
bitmap
colors
the
picture
is
a
marbled
gazebo
on
a
desert
with
blue
sky
background
the
size
is
just
right
for
centered
wallpaper
on
a
display
because
it
leaves
a
border
at
the
bottom
just
big
enough
for
icons
to
fit
in
without
being
on
top
of
the
picture
reguarding
image
quality
and
resolution
i
have
not
seen
much
better
please
do
not
do
this
i
dont
know
how
the
rest
of
you
read
news
but
heres
how
i
do
it
i
subscribe
to
an
outernet
system
which
allows
me
to
dial
up
via
modem
and
download
email
and
news
articles
automatically
when
someone
posts
a
huge
attached
binary
file
i
have
no
choice
but
to
receive
it
along
with
all
the
other
new
articles
in
the
groups
i
subscribe
to
i
also
pay
for
the
connect
time
which
is
normally
not
a
problem
because
i
have
a
modem
and
each
days
uploaddownload
session
takes
only
minutes
or
so
todays
session
however
lasted
about
minutes
because
of
romanbmp
consequently
it
cost
me
about
extra
just
to
receive
a
file
that
i
didnt
want
in
the
first
place
if
you
have
cool
bitmaps
that
you
want
to
make
available
there
are
other
ways
to
do
it
either
upload
the
file
to
an
ftp
site
like
ftpcicaindianaedu
which
has
a
complete
windows
section
and
tell
people
how
to
get
to
it
or
use
one
of
the
newsgroups
like
altbinariespictures
or
something
like
that
which
are
file
archives
rather
than
discussion
groups
dont
use
discussion
groups
like
this
one
to
send
out
attached
files
especially
when
theyre
in
size
