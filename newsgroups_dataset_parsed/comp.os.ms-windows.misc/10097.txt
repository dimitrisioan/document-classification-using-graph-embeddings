RESPONSE
TO
THE
REQUESTS
FOR
COOL
BITMAPS
I
AM
POSTING
ONE
DATE
PM
DUE
TO
THE
RESOLUTION
AND
SIZE
IT
IS
IN
PARTS
THIS
IS
A
UUENCODED
BITMAP
COLORS
THE
PICTURE
IS
A
MARBLED
GAZEBO
ON
A
DESERT
WITH
BLUE
SKY
BACKGROUND
THE
SIZE
IS
JUST
RIGHT
FOR
CENTERED
WALLPAPER
ON
A
DISPLAY
BECAUSE
IT
LEAVES
A
BORDER
AT
THE
BOTTOM
JUST
BIG
ENOUGH
FOR
ICONS
TO
FIT
IN
WITHOUT
BEING
ON
TOP
OF
THE
PICTURE
REGUARDING
IMAGE
QUALITY
AND
RESOLUTION
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
MUCH
BETTER
PLEASE

NOT
DO
