challenge
to
microsoft
supporters
date
apr
gmt
microsoft
is
the
largest
software
company
on
the
planet
yet
i
cannot
think
of
even
one
computing
concept
that
they
innovated
and
brought
to
market
before
anyone
else
xeroxparcapple
osborne
next
gnu
and
others
have
been
pioneers
and
led
the
way
to
the
future
of
computing
what
has
microsoft
done
to
be
a
technological
leader
i
posted
this
question
before
but
i
got
nary
a
reply
i
make
the
challenge
now
to
anyone
who
can
come
up
with
somethingespecially
microsoft
employees
i
get
no
response
this
time
i
guess
it
pretty
much
assures
me
that
there
is
nonewhich
is
what
i
suspect
anyway

invented
the
how
to
make
money
on
others
ideas

made
money
they
werent
in
the
air
at
the
wrong
time
admit
it
billg

a
damn
smart
guy
how
many
out
there
can
make
money
on
almost
useless
productsuseless
even
if
you
look
at
the
time
dos
were
writtenit
stinked
already
then
if
i
could
choose
one
marketing
guy

the
world

think
i
would
choose
him

so
good
that
almost
everyone
hates
him
but
they
still
use
his
stuff
thomasez

not
perfect
but
