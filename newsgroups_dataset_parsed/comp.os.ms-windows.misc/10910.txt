RE
CHALLENGE
TO
MICROSOFT
SUPPORTERS
SINCE
I
STARTED
THIS
TWIST
OF
THIS
THREAD
KURT
BOLLACKER
WRITES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
ENOUGH
IS
INFERIOR
TO
MAKE
IT
OVERALL
AS
A
PRODUCT
INFERIOR
TO
ITS
COMPETITION
APPLE
SYSTEM
NEXTSTEP
UNIXXWINDOWS
PICK
YOUR
FAVORITE
FLAVOR
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IT
IS
YOUR
OPINION
THAT
IS
INFERIOR
TO
ITS
COMPETITION
THATS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
BEING
OBJECTIVELY
INFERIOR
NO
IT
IS
TECHNICALLY
INFERIOR
TO
THE
OSGUIS
THAT
I
LISTED
I
HAVE
ALREADY
DESCRIBED
WHY
TO
SAY
BRIEFLY
ACTUALLY
YOU
FELL
INTO
THE
ABOVE
BECAUSE
YOU
SAID
I
BELIEVE
IF
YOU
HAD
USED
THE
REST
OF
THIS
POST
IN
YOUR
PREVIOUS
POST
I
DO
NOT
THINK
ANYONE
WOULD
HAVE
AGRUED
WITH
YOU
SYSTEM
EASIER
TO
LEARN
AND
USE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
INDEPENDENT
STUDIES
TO
THAT
EFFECT
CAN
RUN
MSW
APPLICATIONS
AND
HAS
MORE
STABLE
MULTITASKING
NEXTSTEP
EASIER
TO
LEARN
USE
AND
PROGRAM
MORE
STABLE
MULTITASKING
UNIXX
AS
EASY
TO
LEARN
AND
USE
MORE
STABLE
MULTITASKING
THE
FOLLOWING
THREE
ARE
NOT
THE
COMPETITION
FOR
WINDOWS
IMHO
OF
COURSE
SYSTEM
DOES
NOT
CURRENTLY
RUN
ON
INTEL
BOXES
NEXTSTEP
RATHER
EXPENSIVE
SHOULD
BE
A
COMPETITOR
TO
WINDOWS
NT
NOT
UNIXX
WITH
THE
EXCEPTION
OF
ALL
OF
THE
ABOVE
WILL
REQUIRE
MOST
USERS
TO
SPEND
A
VERY
LARGE
SUM
OF
MONEY
TO
UPGRADE
APPLICATIONS
TO
ONES
THAT
RUN
UNDER
THESE
OSS
AND
BASICALLY
MONEY
SPEAKS
LOUDER
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
YOU
KEEP
SAYING
MORE
STABLE
MULTITASKING
IS
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
NOT
MULTIFINDER
GEM
GEOWORKS
COOPERATIVE
MULTITASKING
BUT
REAL
HONEST
TO
GOODNESS
PRIORITIZED
PREEMPTIVE
MULTITASKING
WITH
THE
PRPOER
SETUP
ALL
OF
THESE
WILL
EXCHANGE
DATA
WITH
MSW
MACHINES
AS
WELL
AS
MSW
MACHINES
WILL
AMONGST
THEMSELVES
SO
INTEROPERABILITY
IS
NOT
AN
ISSUE
BASICALLY
THIS
IS
MOOT
SINCE
MOST
USERS
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
SHARE
DATA
FOR
QUITE
A
LONG
TIME
BUT
ARE
STILL
TO
BLIND
TO
KNOW
IT
BY
THIS
CRITERION
IT
IS
INFERIOR
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANOTHER
THEN
PERHAPS
I
AM
INCORRECT
DO
YOU
PICK
UP
THE
GLOVE
WHY
PICK
IT
UP
YOU
STATED
THE
REASONS
BEHIND
YOUR
OPINIONS
STATED
THEM
IN
A
VERY
STRAIGHTFORWARD
THOUGH
OVER
PROTECTIVE
MANNER
AND
ASIDE
FROM
MY
EARLIER
COMMENTS
ABOUT
WHO
ACTUALLY
IS
A
COMPETITOR
I
THINK
WE
ARE
IN
AGREEMENT
DOES
TIM
GLAUERT
AGREE
LETS
WAIT
AND
SEE
DISCLAIMER
THE
OPINIONS
EXPRESSED
ARE
MINE
NOT
THOSE
OF
