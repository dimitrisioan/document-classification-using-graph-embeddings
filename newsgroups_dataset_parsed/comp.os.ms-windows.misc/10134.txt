CHALLENGE
TO
MICROSOFT
SUPPORTERS

MS
INNOVATED
ANYTHING
REALLY
WHEN
YOU
COME
DOWN
TO
IT
WHO
CARES
I
JUST
HOPE
MS
KEEPS
DOING
WHAT
THEY
DO
BEST
GETTING
USABLE
PRODUCTIVE
SOFTWARE
TO
THE
MASSES
LETS
SEE
WHAT
MS
PRODUCTS
DONT
HAVE
MAJOR
BUGS
IN
THEM
OH
BUT
THE
FIFTH
RELEASE
THE
BUGS
ARE
GENERALLY
CLEARED
UP
EVEN
IF
THEIR
CUSTOMERS
MUST
BUY
NEW
RELEASES
FROM
THEM
THAT
ARE
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
BUG
FIXES
ANYONE
WHO
BUYS
A
COMPUTER
SYSTEM
AND
THEN
RUNS
MS
WINDOWS
ON
IT
IS
IN
DESPERATE
NEED
OF
SYMPATHY

ON
THE
MS
MOUSEDIDNT

LOGITECH
INSIDE
PERSONALLY
ILL
BE
BLASPHEMOUS
AND
SAY
THAT
IF
MICROSOFT
KEEPS
DOING
WHAT
IT
DOES
SO
WELL
I
HOPE
TO
SEE
MUCH
HARSHERSTRICTER
COPYRIGHT
AND
PATENT
LAWS
FOR
COMPUTER
ALGORITHMS
CONCEPTS
INTERFACES
AND
OTHER
INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTIES
TO
PROTECT
REAL
INNOVATORS
ID
HATE
TO
BE
ONE
WHO
ACTUALLY
DOES
INNOVATE
AND
THEN
HAVE
MICROSOFT
COME
IN
LIKE
A
HUGE
VULTURE
AND
USE
THEIR
BRUTE
MASS
DEVELOPMENT
STAFF
MARKETING
ETC
TO
GET
FAT
OFF
OF
MY
INNOVATION
I
DONT
HAVE
ALL
THAT
MUCH
SYMPATHY
FOR
APPLES
COMPLAINT
AGAINST
MICROSOFT
SINCE
THEY
JUST
TOOK
THE
IDEAS
FROM
XEROXS
PA
RESEARCH
CENTER
WHEN
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
FORCED
XEROX
TO
DISCLOSE
THEIR
PATENTS
OVER
ANTITRUST
FEARS
HOWEVER
FOR
OTHER
COMPANIES
AND
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
HAVE
A
GREAT
IDEA
YET
GET
IT
BORROWED
BY
LARGER
CORPORATIONS
WHO
CAN
AFFORD
TO
QUICKLY
BRING
IT
TO
MARKET
WITHOUT
ANY
LICENSING
FROM
THE
ORIGINAL
INNOVATOR
I
FEEL
MUCH
SYMPATHY
LARRY
LARRY
WEEKS
THOSE
WHO
FIGHT
MONSTERS
SHOULD
MAKE
SURE
THAT
DEVECNPURDUEEDU
IN
THE
PROCESS
HE
DOES
NOT
BECOME
A
MONSTER
AND
WHEN
YOU
LOOK
LONG
INTO
AN
ABYSS
THE
ABYSS
ALSO
LOOKS
INTO
YOU
FRIEDRICH
NIETSZCHE
YOU
CANT
EVEN
REALLY
CALL
IT
SECONDARY
CREATIVITY
WHEN
A
COMPANY
GATHERS
TOGETHER
A
BUNCH
OF
KNOCKOFF
PACKAGES
AND
PEDDLES
THEM
TO
NEOPHYTES
IF
MS
DOES
ANYTHING
IT
APPEARS
SOMEONE
HAS
TO
DO
IT
FIRST
IT
APPEARS
THAT
MS
IS
FINDING
OUT
THAT
THROWING
MONEY
AT
TECHNOLOGICAL
PROBLEMS
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
A
GUARANTEED
SOLUTION
