ME
GPF
ON
ME
OF
LATE
IT
WAS
NEVER
A
VERY
STABLE
PACKAGE
BUT
NOW
IT
SEEMS
TO
CRASH
EVERY
DAY
THE
WORST
PART
ABOUT
IT
IS
THAT
IT
DOES
NOT
CRASH
CONSISTENTLY
IE
I
THERE
IS
A
WAY
IN
SYSINI
TO
TURN
OFF
RAM
PARITY
CHECKING
UNFORTUNATELY
MY
GOOD
WINDOWS
REFERENCES
ARE
AT
HOME
BUT
ANY
STANDARD
WIN
REFERENCE
WILL
TELL
YOU
HOW
TO
DO
IT

THE
SLIGHT
RISK
OF
DATA
CORRUPTION
DUE
TO
A
MISSED
REAL
ERROR
I
HAD
THIS
VERY
SAME
PROBLEM
AND
DID
WORK
AROUND
BY
TURNING
PARITY
CHECKING
OFF
BUT
THAT
ONLY
WORKED
WHILE
I
WAS
IN
WINDOWS
AND
THE
PARITY
ERROR
WOULD
OCCUR
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
EXITING
WINDOWS
HOWEVERTHE
PROBLEM
TURNED
OUT
TO
BE
CHIP
SIMMS
VS
CHIP
SIMMS
I
CANT
USE
CHIP
SIMMS
IN
MY
COMPUTER
AND
WHEN
I
REPLACED
THEM
THE
PROBLEM
VANISHED
FOREVER
