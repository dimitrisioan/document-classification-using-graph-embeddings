SYNOPSIS
I
WROTE
CAN
ANYONE
TELL
ME
WHERE
I
CAN
FIND
AN
MSWINDOWS
TRUETYPE
FONT
THAT

ME
THE
CHARACTERS

THE
OLD
STYLE
FOR

IN
THIS
FONT
THE

MANY
THANKS
TO
THOSE
WHO
RESPONDED
TO
MY
QUESTION
UNFORTUNATELY
I
HAVE
HAD
NO
LUCK
IN
ACTUALLY
GETTING
SUCH
A
FONT
AND
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
INTERESTED
IN
GETING
ONE
AND
SO
I
HAVE
DECIDED
TO
CREATE
MY
OWN
TRUETYPE
FONT
FITTING
THAT
DESCRIPTION
THIS
FONT
IS
BASED
ON
THAT
USED
IN
THE
ISSUE
OF
DINEENS
DICTIONARY
AND
IS
TYPICAL
OF
THAT
FOUND
IN
IRISH
BOOKS
FROM
THE
EARLY
PART
OF
THE
CENTURY
THIS
MAY
TAKE
ME
SOME
TIME
TO
DO
IN
MY
LIMITED
SPARE
TIME
BUT
ILL
MAKE
IT
AVAILABLE
TO
ANYONE
WHO
IS
INTERESTED
WHEN
IT
IS
READY
