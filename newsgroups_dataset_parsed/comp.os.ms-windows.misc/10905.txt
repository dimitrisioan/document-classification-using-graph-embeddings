none
of
this
changes
the
fact
that
is
objectively
inferior
to
its
competition
do
you
mean
that
is
objectively
inferior
in
some
respects
which
is
trivially
true
that
it
is
objectively
inferior
in
all
respecets
which
is
trivially
false
or
do
you
mean
something
else
what
criteria
have
you
chosen
for
your
objective
assesment
are
you
sure
that
these
criteria
are
themselves
objective
i
believe
that
enough
is
inferior
to
make
it
overall
as
a
product
inferior
to
its
competition
apple
system
nextstep
unixxwindows
pick
your
favorite
flavor
in
other
words
it
is
your
opinion
that
is
inferior
to
its
competition
thats
not
the
same
as
being
objectively
inferior
no
it
is
technically
inferior
to
the
osguis
that
i
listed
i
have
already
described
why
to
say
briefly
system
easier
to
learn
and
use
there
have
been
independent
studies
to
that
effect
can
run
msw
applications
and
has
more
stable
multitasking
nextstep
easier
to
learn
use
and
program
more
stable
multitasking
unixx
as
easy
to
learn
and
use
more
stable
multitasking
with
the
prpoer
setup
all
of
these
will
exchange
data
with
msw
machines
as
well
as
msw
machines
will
amongst
themselves
so
interoperability
is
not
an
issue
by
this
criterion
it
is
inferior
if
you
have
another
then
perhaps
i
am
incorrect
do
you
pick
up
the
glove
