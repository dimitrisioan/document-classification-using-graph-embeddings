currently
wintrumpet
is
in
very
late
beta
it
looks
like
an
excellent
product
with
several
features
beyond
the
dos
version
wintrumpet
supports
the
trumpet
tcp
novell
lwp
and
there
is
also
a
direct
to
packet
driver
version
that
some
people
are
using
with
the
dispkt
shim
whats
it
gonna
cost
again
i
do
not
speak
for
peter
tattam
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
will
shareware
status
as
trumpet
for
dos
is
and
i
imagine
that
the
registration
fees
will
be
similar
i
also
believe
that
a
new
version
of
trumpet
for
dos
will
be
released
sometime
in
the
near
future
