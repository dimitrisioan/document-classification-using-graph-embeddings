WRITES
AFTER
HEARING
ENDLESS
DEBATE
READ
NAMECALLING
OVER
WHICH
OS
IS
BETTER
DOS
AND
WINDOWS
OR
AND
FINALLY
HAVING
ENOUGHT
RESOURSES
TO
PLAY
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
DIFFERENT
OPERATING
SYSTEMS
I
HAVE
DECIDED
TO
PUT
THE
TWO
PRODUCTS
TO
A
HEAD
TO
HEAD
TEST
AS
SO
MANY
FELLOW
NEWSPOSTERS
HAVE
SUGGESTED
I
HAVE
HOWEVER
NO
DESIRE
WHATSOEVER
TO
USE
A
VERSION
OF
WHICH
WONT
REALLY
DO
WHAT
IT
SAYS
IE
RUN
WINDOWS
APPS
WILL
NOT
RUN
WINDOWS
APPS
IN
ENHANSED
MODE
SOMETHING
THAT
MOST
LARGER
WINDOWS
APPS
REQUIRE
BUT
WHICH
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
IN
BETA
TEST
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
BETA
IS
AVAILABLE
VIA
FTP
AND
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
KNEW
WHERE
TO
OBTAIN
A
COPY
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
ANY
INFORMATION
AS
I
WOULD
LIKE
ONCE
AND
FOR
ALL
TO
ESTABLISH
FOR
MYSELF
WHICH
IS
THE
BEST
OS
FOR
MY
NEEDS
I
DONT
THINK
THE
QUESTION
IS
WILL
XX
RUN
WINDOWS
YY
APPS
NOW
A
MORE
IMPORTANT
QUESTION
IS
WILL
SUBSEQUENT
VERSIONS
CONTINUE
TO
RUN
APPS
FROM
SUBSEQUENT
WINDOWS
VERSIONS
IN
THE
FUTURE
CAN
IT
KEEP
UP
WILL
A
FUTURE
RUN
WINDOWS
APPS
IS
VERY
COMPLEX
AND
IS
THE
SIGN
OF
THINGS
TO
COME
AFTER
THIS
FALL
I
BELIEVE
IBM
NO
LONGER
HAS
ANY
RIGHTS
TO
VIEW
MICROSOFT
CODE
AFTER
THAT
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
MAINTAIN
SOME
SORT
OF
COMPATIBILITY
IS
TO
REVERSEENGINEER
