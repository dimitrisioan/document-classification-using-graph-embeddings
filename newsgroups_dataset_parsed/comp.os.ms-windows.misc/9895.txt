HI
WELL
I
REALLY
HATE
TO
MAKE
A
DECISION
BUT
RECENTLY
I
HAVE
TO
CHOOSE
WHETHER
STACKER
OR
DOS
WITH
DOUBLE
SPACE
FOR
MY
POOR
HD
I
AM
USING
WINDWOS
AND
I
HOPE
WHAT
I
CHOOSE
WILL
LIVE
WITH
WINDOWS
ANY
HELP
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED
FOREVER

STACKER
ACHIEVES
BETTER
COMPRESSION
RATIO
THAN
YET
THE
LATTER
COMES
WITH
VIRUS
DETECTION
MEMORY
MANAGER
AND
MULTIPLE
BOOTING
EACH
OF
THEM
ARE
NOT
SO
GOOD
AS
THE
NAV
QEMM
OR
NDOS
IN
MY
OPINION
BUT
WITH
A
PACKAGE
OF
ONLY
ITS
NICE
IF
HAVENT
YET
INSTALLED
ALL
OF
THOSE
STUFFS
BOTH
CERTAINLY
WORK
WITH
