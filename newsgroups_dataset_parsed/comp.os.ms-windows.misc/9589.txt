SCOTT
P
REIMERT
WRITES
SOMEWHERE
IN
THIS
THREAD
IT
HAS
BEEN
SAID
THAT
WINDOWS
NT
TM
IS
A
MULTIUSER
OS
AS
WELL
AS
MULTITHREADING
ETC
I
CERTAINLY
HAVENT
SEEN
THIS
TO
BE
THE
CASE
THERE
ARE
SEPERATE
ACCOUNTS
FOR
EACH
PERSON
AND
EVEN
SEPERATE
DIRECTORIES
IF
THAT
IS
DESIRED
I
DONT
SEE
AN
IMPLENTATION
OF
SIMULTANEUOS
USE
THOUGH
SCOTT
IT
CERTAINLY
IS
MULTIUSER
WHAT
I
HAVE
SEEN
FROM
THE
MARCH
BETA
IS
THAT
IT
DOESNT
YET
COME
WITH
THE
STUFF
WHICH
EXPLOITS
MULTIUSER
FEATURES
I
REMEMBER
SOMEBODY
FROM
MS
STATING
THAT
IT
DOESNT
ALLOW
TWO
USERS
SHARE
ONE
GUI
MY
INTERPRETATION
OF
THIS
WAS
THAT
ONE
USER
PER
CONSOLE
BUT
ALL
THE
NETWORKING
AND
RPC
BASED
STUFF
YOU
WANT
I
BELIEVE
FTP
AND
RLOGIN
DEAMONS
FOR
NT
SYSTEMS
WILL
COME
FROM
THIRD
PARTY
SOMEBODY
ALREADY
HAS
A
BETA
VERSION
OF
AN
UNSECURE
FTPD
ON
THE
NET
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
WHY
ONE
CANNOT
WRITE
A
POSIX
BASED
SHELL
LIKE
CSH
ON
UNIX
FOR
REMOTE
LOGINS
IN
GENERAL
I
LIKED
NT
WHEN
I
CHECKED
IT
OUT
IT
SLOW
COMPARED
TO
JUST
LIKE
ANY
OTHER
REAL
OS
THE
BETA
VERSION
ALTHOUGH
BEING
SLOW
BOTTS
UP
MUCH
FASTER
THAN
MY
SUN
WORKSTATION
WINDOWS
SUBSYSTEMS
ALSO
START
UP
A
LOT
FASTER
THAN
X
WINDOWS
I
BELIEVE
BILL
GATES
WAS
RIGHT
WHEN
HE
STATED
THAT
NT
WAS
NOT
FOR
EVERYBODY
AFTER
PLAYING
AROUND
WITH
IT
FOR
A
WHILE
I
WAS
CONVINCED
IF
I
OWNED
A
BUSINES
USING
A
BUSINESS
COMPUTER
FROM
IBM
OR
SOME
OTHER
ESTABLISHED
VENDOR
I
WOULD
CONSIDER
MOVING
TO
NT
PLATFORM
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
PROVIDE
A
MUCH
CHEAPER
SOLUTION
IF
YOU
ARE
RUNNING
SQL
SERVERS
ETC
IT
PROVIDES
THE
ROBUSTNESS
SUCH
AN
APPLICATION
REQUIRES
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
YOU
LIKE
YOUR
DOS
GAMES
MORE
OR
LESS
FORGET
ABOUT
NT
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
BOOT
TO
DOS
BUT
IN
GENERAL
THAT
DEFEATS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
USING
NT
MOST
OF
NTS
FEATURES
ARE
VISIBLE
IN
A
NETWORKED
ENVIRONMENT
AND
IN
SUCH
AN
ENVIRONMENT
YOU
CANT
REBOOT
YOUR
MACHINE
AT
WILL
FOR
PERSONAL
USE
I
WOULD
RATHER
WAIT
FOR
THE
BASED
WINDOWS
RELEASE
WHATEVER
YOU
NAME
IT
THAN
JUMP
TO
NT
BANDWAGON
I
EXPECT
MOST
APPLICATIONS
WILL
KEEP
ON
USING
UNTIL
BECOMES
WIDELY
AVAILABLE
