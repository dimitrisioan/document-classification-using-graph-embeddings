i
have
several
people
sharing
my
machine
and
would
like
to
set
up
separate
environments
under
windows
for
each
of
them
is
there
some
way
of
setting
things
up
separate
desktopsdirectories
for
each
of
them
ideally
id
like
totally
separate
virtual
machines
id
be
willing
to
settle
for
less
and
may
end
up
having
batch
files
that
copy
ini
files
around
depending
on
who
wants
to
use
the
machine
you
could
use
dos
to
do
this
partly
you
can
set
up
different
configsys
and
autoexecbat
commands
for
each
user
and
they
just
have
to
select
their
menu
option
on
bootup
then
you
can
have
the
autoexecbat
copy
the
winini
and
systemini
files
and
change
directories
for
them
when
they
exit
windows
it
can
copy
back
generic
ini
files
if
you
want
this
is
the
only
way
i
can
think
of
there
may
be
some
programs
somewhere
that
allow
you
to
do
this
better
though
using
dos
allows
each
person
to
have
a
custom
configsys
and
autoexecbat
