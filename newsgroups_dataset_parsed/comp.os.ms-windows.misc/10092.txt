size
is
another
factor
the
is
much
smaller
but
the
hp
is
built
like
a
tank
i
bet
the
would
get
damaged
first
you
bet
your
bippy
its
built
like
a
tank
and
not
just
mechanically
either
this
past
weekend
we
had
a
nasty
thunderstorm
and
the
impossible
happened
i
got
a
direct
lightning
strike
on
my
house
and
to
the
second
floor
outlet
box
into
which
my
faithful
deskjet
was
connected
there
was
a
hole
in
the
aluminum
siding
with
some
solidified
aluminum
slag
dripping
from
it
you
could
actually
see
the
electrical
box
through
the
hole
the
outlet
itself
was
fried
and
im
still
amazed
the
whole
damn
house
didnt
burn
down
i
lost
electric
garage
door

of
which
were

of
the

and
a

card
in
my
pc
not
a
good
night
but
the
deskjet
ran
as
soon
as
i
found
a
functioning
serial
and
parallel
port
to
connect
to
it
