CHRIS

WRITES
DOUBLESPACE
ALTHOUGH
I
DO
NOT
TRUST
IT
FOR
MY
HARD
DISKS
SOUNDS
GREAT
FOR
FLOPPIES
THE
THOUOGHT
OF
HAVING
TO
MOUNT
THE
DISK
IS
ANOYING
BUT
SOMETHING
I
CAN
DEAL
WITH
THE
PROBLEM
ARISES
WHEN
UNDER
WINDOWS
IS
THERE
A
WAY
TO
MOUNT
AND
UNMOUNT
WHILE
UNDER
WINDOWS
OR
IS
THIS
PART
OF
THE
UPGRADES
SOON
TO
BE
AVAILABLE
FROM
OTHER
VENDORS
CHRIS
I
CANT
SEE
WHY
YOU
WOULD
NOT
TRUST
IT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SAFER
THAN
ANY
PREVIOUS
COMPRESSION
PROGRAMS
IT
INTEGRATES
INTO
THE
KERNAL
AND
MAKES
IT
NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DELETE
