im
not
sure
if
this
is
the
proper
place
to
post
this
the
icons
on
program
manager
have
all
dissapeared
and
i
need
to
restore
them
the
files
all
seem
to
be
there
on
the
disk
and
i
think
there
must
be
a
better
way
than
re
installing
everything
thanks
for
any
help
hmmmmm
you
know
this
happened
to
me
also
i
am
not
sure
what
caused
it
i
think
there
might
have
been
a
system
error
and
dumped
windows
i
came
back
and
all
was
well
except
no
groups
program
manager
was
empty
all
the
grp
files
were
in
the
directory
i
had
to
remake
the
groups
with
the
new
and
group
selection
all
the
icons
and
files
inside
the
groups
were
still
there
and
working
fine
just
the
groups
had
gone
out
of
program
manager
