serial
printing
in
windows
i
am
getting
garbled
output
when
serial
printing
thru
windows
works
etc
this
has
occurred
on
several
systems
and
goes
if
a
laserjet
is
used
i
suspect
that
there
is
no
need
for
handshaking
in
this
case
due
to
the
capacity
memoryspeed
of
it
there
is
no
problem
printing
from
dos
are
there
any
obvious
tweaks
im
missing
im
sure
its
not
just
me
with
this
problem
thanks
for
reading
