SERIAL
PRINTING
IN
WINDOWS
I
AM
GETTING
GARBLED
OUTPUT
WHEN
SERIAL
PRINTING
THRU
WINDOWS
WORKS
ETC
THIS
HAS
OCCURRED
ON
SEVERAL
SYSTEMS
AND
GOES
IF
A
LASERJET

USED
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
FOR
HANDSHAKING
IN
THIS
CASE
DUE
TO
THE
CAPACITY
MEMORYSPEED
OF
IT
THERE
IS
NO
PROBLEM

OBVIOUS
TWEAKS
IM
MISSING
IM
SURE
ITS

THIS
PROBLEM
