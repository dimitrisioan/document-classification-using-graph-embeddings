i
know
this
is
probably
a
faq
but
i
installed
the
sw
for
my
ati
graphics
card
and
it
bashed
my
windows
logo
files
when
i
start
windows
now
it
has
the
logo
instead
of
the
logo
i
thought
the
files
that
controlled
this
were
windowssystemvgalogorle
windowssystemvgalogolgo
i
restored
these
files
but
it
didnt
change
the
logo
anyone
know
what
the
correct
files
are
i
believe
you
have
the
correct
files
i
think
what
youll
have
to
do
is
go
back
into
setup
and
choose
change
video
adapter
or
whatever
it
is
called
then
the
trick
is
choose
the
same
adaptor
you
currently
have
what
setup
does
is
it
actually
changes
the
file
wincom
whenever
you
go
into
it
and
change
the
video
hardware
selection
it
incorporates
the
contents
of
vgalogorle
into
wincom
when
you
do
this
this
trick
can
also
be
used
to
change
the
startup
logo
into
whatever
you
want
it
to
be
