microsoft
is
the
largest
software
company
on
the
planet
yet
i
cannot
think
of
even
one
computing
concept
that
they
innovated
and
brought
to
market
before
anyone
else
xeroxparcapple
osborne
next
gnu
and
others
have
been
pioneers
and
led
the
way
to
the
future
of
computing
what
has
microsoft
done
to
be
a
technological
leader
i
posted
this
question
before
but
i
got
nary
a
reply
i
make
the
challenge
now
to
anyone
who
can
come
up
with
somethingespecially
microsoft
employees
i
get
no
response
this
time
i
guess
it
pretty
much
assures
me
that
there
is
nonewhich
is
what
i
suspect
anyway
really
when
you
come
down
to
it
who
cares
i
just
hope
ms
keeps
doing
what
they
do
best
getting
usable
productive
software
to
the
masses
thx

you
think
that
windows
is
useable

must
not
use
it
much
windows
version
of
crash
protection
is
wearing
a
helmet
while
computing
the
arir
air
bag
is
an
expensive
addon
