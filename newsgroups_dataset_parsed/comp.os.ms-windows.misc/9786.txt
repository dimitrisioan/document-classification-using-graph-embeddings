very
simple
you
have
to
have
the
mousecom
or
mousesys
loaded
in
dos
before
you
run
windows
note
that
you
dont
need
to
have
these
files
loaded
to
use
the
mouse
in
windows
one
addition
to
this
i
dont
know
if
it
applies
to
everybody
for
my
microsoft
mouse
to
work
with
windowed
dos
apps
i
had
to
use
the
driver
that
came
with
windows
version
didnt
allow
me
to
do
it
for
some
reason
