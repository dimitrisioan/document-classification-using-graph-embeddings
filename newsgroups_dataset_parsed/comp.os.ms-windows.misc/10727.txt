ignore
the
attacks

and

stock
price
if
you
need
some
gratification
just
keep
doing
the
great

you
have
done
in
the
past
thx
dave
l
this
is
the
part
that
usually
gets
me
while
i
am
set
to
make
money
there
usually
are
other
things
to
be
considered
and
debated
that
is
the
purpose
of
life
if
you
only
willing
to
look
at
the
stock
price
and
sales
numbers
for
gratification
usually
youll
end
up
with
japanese
or
whoever
that
is
competitive
owing
your
business
ie
shortsighted
imo
this
is
very
irresponsible
narrow
minded
and
selfish
henceforth
ignoring
the
attack
is
not
the
right
approach
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
just
happen
to
believe
the
willingness
to
debate
and
readjust
is
the
greatest
assets
of
this
society
sales
number
and
stock
price
is
the
shortterm
result
not
the
cause
