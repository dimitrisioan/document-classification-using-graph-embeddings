think
technology
that
wil
run

straight
outta

box
it
will
certainly
help
to
be
able
to
run
windows
and
dos
apps
but
the
only
way
that
solaris
or
or
any
other
scheme
is
going
to
challenge
microsoft
is
if
they
can
somehow
get
the
prices
for
solaris
or
or
whatever
apps
down
to
a
dos
competitive
level
everybody
would
rather
run
a
solaris
app
on
a
solaris
system
and
an
app
on
an
system
they
usually
just
cant
afford
a
unix
system
because
of
the
high
prices
for
good
unix
software
the
natural
progress
of
things
is
for
government
to
gain
ground
and
for
liberty
to
yield
