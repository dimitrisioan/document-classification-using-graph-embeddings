ive
been
running
dos
for
about
a
month
i
was
generally
impressed
with
the
improvements
the
multiple
boot
configurations
were
great
the
new
commands
were
nice
and
doublespace
worked
fine
twice
as
slow
for
large
data
transfers
twice
as
fast
for
small
with
smartdrv
until
now
this
morning
at
am
while
i
was
working
on
my
research
paper
i
had
to
reboot
a
hung
dos
program
that
did
no
disk
io
from
within
windows
when
my
machine
finished
rebooting
i
found
my
windows
directory
and
about
two
thirds
of
my
other
directories
were
irreversibly
corrupted
i
cannot
afford
problems
like
this
im
returning
to
dos
mark
ps
ive
also
noticed
bad
sector
errors
from
doublespace
where
none
should
exist
infoworld
april
issue
has
two
articles
about
problems
with
dos
a
second
look
article
calls
it
a
loaded
gun
and
that
people
should
exercise
extreme
caution
if
they
decide
to
use
it
the
point
out
that
doublespace
and
memmaker
are
both
problem
areas
that
will
cause
a
number
of
folks
problems
mss
response
was
to
the
effect
that
there
had
been
no
problems
reported
that
they
could
duplicate
probably
are
not
trying
too
hard
cringely
reports
that
a
lot
of
folks
are
gettinggoing
to
get
burned
on
the
support
lines
his
example
was
a
call
that
cost
for
minutes
of
tech
support
after
minutes
on
hold
i
want
to
see
the
ms
spin
doctors
explain
this
