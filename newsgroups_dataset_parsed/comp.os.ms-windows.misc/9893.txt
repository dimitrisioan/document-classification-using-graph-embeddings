fast
dosvga
and
windows
video
card
info
needed
ok
i
have
a
w
diamond
stealth
vram
i
was
really
satisfied
w
its
performance
in
windows
but
now
more
and
more
games
needs
higher
frame
rates
in
dos
vga
especially
this
new
strike
commander
this
stealth
vram
can
only
give
me
fps
i
use
my
winmark
was
million
i
think
so
right
now
im
considering
to
replace
it
w
a
new
card
which
hopefully
can
perform
approx
same
w
my
current
vram
in
windows
and
also
can
perform
dos
vga
preferably
i
also
saw
the
benchmark
list
from
someone
who
compiled
it
in
csipg
and
it
looked
that
speedstar
and
orchid
prodesigner
ware
the
fastest
for
non
local
bus
motherboard
both
can
give
in
dos
vga
w
does
anyone
have
a
winmarks
for
both
of
those
cards
above
with
the
processor
type
which
one
is
the
worthiestnot
necessarily
fastest
any
other
card
recommendation
is
welcomed
too
also
if
possible
where
can
i
get
this
card
for
the
cheapest
