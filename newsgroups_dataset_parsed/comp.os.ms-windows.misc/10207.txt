RECOMMENDATION
FOR
SCREEN
CAPTURE
PROGRAM
IM
LOOKING
FOR
SOME
RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
SCREEN
CAPTURE
PROGRAMS
A
COUPLE
OF
ISSUES
AGO
PC
MAG
LISTED
AS
EDITORS
CHOICES
BOTH
CONVERSION
ARTIST
AND
HIJAAK
FOR
WINDOWS
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THOSE
OR
SOME
OTHERS
IM
TRYING
TO
GET
AN
ALPHA
MANUAL
IN
THE
NEXT
FEW
DAYS
AND
IM
NOT
MAKING
MUCH
PROGRESS
WITH
THE
SCREEN
SHOTS
IM
CURRENTLY
USING
DODOT
AND
IM
ABOUT
TO
BURN
IT
AND
THE
DISKS
IT
RODE
IT
ON
ITS
GOT
A
LOT
OF
FREAKY
BUGS
AND
OVERSIGHTS
THAT
ARE
DRIVING
ME
CRAZY
TONIGHT
IT
DECIDED
THAT
FOR
ANY
GRAPHIC
IT
WRITES
OUT
AS
A
TIFF
FILE
THATS
UNDER
A
CERTAIN
ARBITRARY
SIZE
IT
WILL
SWAP
THE
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
SIDES
OF
THE
PICTURE
USUALLY
IT
CONFINES
ITSELF
TO
NOT
COPYING
THINGS
TO
THE
CLIPBOARD
SO
I
HAVE
TO
SAVE
AND
LOAD
PIX
FOR
EDITING
IN
PAINTBRUSH
OR
CRASHING
EVERY
HOUR
OR
SO
THE
ONE
NICE
THING
IT
HAS
THOUGH
IS
ITS
DITHER
OPTION
YOUD
THINK
THAT
THIS
WOULD
TURN
COLORS
INTO
DOTS
WHICH
IT
DOES
IF
YOU
GO
FROM
SAY
COLORS
TO
COLORS
BUT
IF
YOU
GO
FROM
OR
COLORS
TO
BW
YOU
CAN
SET
A
THRESHOLD
LEVEL
FOR
WHICH
COLORS
TURN
TO
BLACK
AND
WHICH
TURN
TO
WHITE
FOR
ME
THIS
IS
USEFUL
BECAUSE
I
CAN
TURN
LIGHT
GRAYS
ON
BUTTONS
TO
WHITE
AND
THE
DARK
GRAYS
TO
BLACK
AND
THEREBY
PRESERVE
THE
ON
BUTTONS
AND
OTHER
PARTS
OF
THE
WINDOW
IF
YOU
UNDERSTOOD
MY
DESCRIPTION
CAN
YOU
TELL
ME
IF
ANOTHER
LESS
BUGGY
PROGRAM
CAN
DO
THIS
AS
WELL
MUCH
THANKS
FOR
ANY
HELP
