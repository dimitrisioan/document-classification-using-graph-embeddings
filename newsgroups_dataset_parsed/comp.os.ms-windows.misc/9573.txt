canon
bubblejet
and
hp
deskjet
hello
fellow
netters
i
am
asking
for
your
collected
wisdom
to
help
me
decide
which
printer
i
should
purchase
the
canon
bubblejet
vs
the
hp
deskjet
i
thought
rather
than
trust
the
salesperson
i
would
benefit
more
from
relying
on
those
who
use
these
printers
daily
and
use
them
to
their
fullest
potential
and
i
figure
all
of
you
will
know
their
benefits
and
pitfalls
better
than
any
salesperson
now
i
would
greatly
appreciate
any
information
you
could
render
on
the
dpi
of
the
canon
bubblejet
vs
the
hewlettpackard
deskjet
dpi
which
is
faster
is
there
a
noticeable
print
quality
difference
particularly
in
graphics
which
will
handle
large
documents
better
pages
or
more
any
personal
experience
on
either
will
be
appreciated
here
which
works
better
under
windows
any
driver
problems
etc
cost
of
memory
font
packages
toner
cartridges
etc
basically
your
personal
experiences
with
either
of
these
machines
is
highly
desirable
both
good
and
bad
advance
kudos
and
thanks
for
all
your
input
email
or
news
posting
is
readily
acceptable
but
email
is
encouraged
limits
bandwidth
sincerely

and
