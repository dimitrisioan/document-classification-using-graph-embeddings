win
and
after
hearing
endless
debate
read
namecalling
over
which
os
is
better
dos
and
windows
or
and
finally
having
enought
resourses
to
play
with
a
couple
of
different
operating
systems
i
have
decided
to
put
the
two
products
to
a
head
to
head
test
as
so
many
fellow
newsposters
have
suggested
i
have
however
no
desire
whatsoever
to
use
a
version
of
which
wont
really
do
what
it
says
ie
run
windows
apps
will
not
run
windows
apps
in
enhansed
mode
something
that
most
larger
windows
apps
require
but
which
is
supposed
to
be
in
beta
test
is
supposed
to
i
have
heard
that
beta
is
available
via
ftp
and
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
knew
where
to
obtain
a
copy
i
would
appreciate
any
information
as
i
would
like
once
and
for
all
to
establish
for
myself
which
is
the
best
os
for
my
needs
