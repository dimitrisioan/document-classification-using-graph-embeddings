PART
OF
THEIR

THE
MESSAGE

SELECTED
A
SWAP

GREATER
THAN
THE
SUGGESTED
SIZEWINDOWS
WILL
ONLY
USE
THE
SIZE
SUGGESTEDDO
YOU
WANT
TO
CREATE
THIS
SWAP
FILE
ANYWAY
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WELL
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
ROBERT
CALLED
MICROSOFT
AND
ASKED
THEM
WHAT
AND
WHY
WHAT
THEY
SAID
IS
THAT
WINDOWS
CHECKS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
FREE
DISK
SPACE
AND
DIVIDES
THAT
NUMBER
BY
THEN
IT
CHECKS
FOR
THE
LARGEST
CONTIGUOUS
BLOCK
OF
FREE
DISK
SPACE
WINDOWS
THEN
SUGGESTS
THE
SMALLER
OF
THE
TWO
NUMBERS
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
UNDER
ABSOLUTELY
NO
CIRCUMSTANCESNONEWILL
WINDOWS
USES
A
SWAP
FILE
LARGER
THAN
THE
SUGGESTED
SIZE
WELLTHATS
WHAT
HE
SAID
I
CALL
BULL
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
WHY
DOES
WINDOWS
REPORT
THE
MEMORY
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
ME
IF
ITS
NOT
GOING
TO
USE
IT
ANY
TAKERS
JAMES
WELL
SOMEONE
AT
MICROSOFT
TOLD
YOU
WRONG
WINDOWS
WILL
USE
A
SWAP
FILE
LARGER
THAN
THE
RECOMMENDED
SIZE
LAST
SUMMER
I
WENT
TO
A
MICROSOFT
WINDOWS
TECHNICAL
WORKSHOP
AND
THEY
DISTRIBUTED
A
LOT
OF
INFORMATION
THAT
THE
GENERAL
PUBLIC
MIGHT
NOT
BE
AWARE
OF
ANYWAY
IN
THE
MAIN
BOOK
THEY
HANDED
OUT
THEY
HAVE
A
SECTION
ON
CREATING
LARGER
THAN
RECOMMENDED
SWAPFILE
ILL
QUOTE
THE
INFORMATION
IF
YOU
CREATE
A
PERMANENT
SWAPFILE
LARGER
THAN
THE
RECOMMENDED
SIZE
YOU
WILL
RECEIVE
A
MESSAGE
TELLING
YOU
THAT
WINDOWS
WILL
NOT
USE
ANYTHING
LARGER
THAN
THE
RECOMMENDED
SIZE
THIS
ERROR
MESSAGE
IS
INCORRECT
WE
WILL
ALLOW
THE
USE
OF
THE
LARGER
SWAPFILE
UP
TO
FOUR
TIMES
THE
AMOUNT
OF
RAM
ON
YOUR
MACHINE
SO
AS
YOU
SEE
MICROSOFT
DOES
KNOW
THAT
THE
INFORMATION
IS
INCORRECT
YOU
PROBABLY
JUST
RAN
INTO
SOME
DOOFBALL
WHO
WAS
NEW
ON
THE
JOB
AND
WAS
ONLY
TELLING
YOU
WHAT
LITTLE
HE
KNEW
BE
THAT
WHAT
IT
MAY
I
WOULD
REALLY
SUGGEST
TO
EVERYONE
TO
TAKE
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
GO
TO
THESE
TECHNICAL
WORKSHOPS
THEY
ARENT
ACTUALLY
INCREDIBLY
INDEPTH
BUT
YOU
DO
GET
A
LOT
OF
MATERIAL
ABOUT
BUGS
AND
OPTIMIZATION
STRAIGHT
FROM
THOSE
IN
THE
KNOW
BESIDES
THAT
THEY
OFFER
YOU
HUGE
DISCOUNTS
ON
SOFTWARE
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
YOU
COULD
PICK
UP
WORD
EXCEL
OR
WHATEVER
THEIR
PRESENTATION
PROGRAM
IS
FOR
THAT
IS
THE
FULL
BLOWN
VERSION
NOT
AN
UPGRADE
OR
EDUCATIONAL
VERSION
YOU
COULD
ALSO
PICK
UP
MICROSOFT
OFFICE
FOR
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
MYSELF
I
SPRANG
FOR
WORD
WELL
HOPE
THAT
WAS
HELPFUL
TO
SOMEONE
AND
BESIDES
THAT
I
HOPE
SOMEONE
WILL
GO
TO
A
WORKSHOP
AND
SAVE
A
LITTLE
MONEY
AND
IF
ANYONE
AT
MICROSOFT
IS
READING
THIS
I
REALLY
LOVE
YOUR
PRODUCTS
I
NEED
A
JOB
ONCE
I
GRADUATE
ALSO
CAN
WE
WORK
SOMETHING
OUT
THANKS
