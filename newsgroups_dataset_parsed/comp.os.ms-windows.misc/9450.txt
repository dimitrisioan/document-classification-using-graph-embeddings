RE
PERMANAENT
SWAP
FILE
WITH
DOS
DBLDISK
IN
COMPOSMSWINDOWSMISC
YOU
WRITE
WHILE
READING
THROUGH
THE
DOS
BOOK
IT
STATES
THAT
THE
WINDOWS
PERMANAENT
SWAP
FILE
WILL
NOT
WORK
CORRECTLY
WHEN
PLACED
ON
A
COMPRESSED
DRIVE
TO
MAKE
THINGS
COMPATABLE
I
REMOVED
MY
PERMANENT
SWAP
FILE
BEFORE
STARTING
THE
UPGRADE
HOWEVER
WHEN
ALL
THE
DUST
SETTLED
AND
I
GO
INTO
WINDOWS
IT
SAYS
THAT
THE
TEMPORARY
SWAP
FILE
IS
RIGHT
WHERE
IT
ALWAYS
WAS
IN
THE
WINDOWS
DIRECTORY
MY
QUESTION
IS
HOW
COME
THE
TEMPORARY
SWAP
FILES
WORKS
OK
WITH
A
COMPRESSED
DRIVE
AND
THE
PERMANENT
ONE
DOESNT
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
LOOK
IN
WINDOWS
FAQ
FOR
THIS
ONE
BUT
HERE
IS
MY
BEST
EXPLANATION
BUT
I
CANT
GUARANTEE
THAT
IM
NOT
WAY
OFF
BASE
THE
PERMENANT
SWAP
FILE
IS
READWRITTEN
TO
BY
WINDOWS
BY
TALKING
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
HARD
DISK
CONTROLLER
CARD
THE
CONTROLLER
CARD
MUST
USE
THE
PROTOCAL
SET
UP
BY
WESTERN
DIGITAL
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WINDOWS
CREATES
A
FILE
CALLED
SPARTPAR
IN
YOUR
WINDOWS
DIRECTORY
THAT
POINTS
TO
THAT
FILE
IT
THEN
USES
THE
PHYSICAL
INFORMATION
ABOUT
YOUR
DISK
TO
INDEX
TO
INFORMATION
IN
THAT
FILE
COMPRESSED
DISKS
ARE
ACTUALLY
LOGICAL
DISKS
THESE
DISKS
HAVE
DIFFERENT
CHARACTERISTICS
THAN
THE
ACTUAL
PHYSICAL
DISK
FURTHERMORE
THE
INFORMATION
ON
THE
COMPRESSED
DISKS
MUST
BE
UNCOMPRESSED
BEFORE
IT
IS
USED
IE
IT
MUST
GO
THROUGH
THE
DECOMPRESSION
PROGRAM
THAT
TRAPS
DISK
READS
AT
THE
OPERATING
SYSTEM
LEVEL
OR
THE
BIOS
LEVEL
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
INBETWEEN
PROGRAM
WINDOWS
CANNOT
USE
DIRECT
METHODS
TO
READ
FROM
THE
LOGICAL
DISK
A
PERMENANT
SWAP
FILE
IS
ONLY
THERE
TO
RESERVE
AN
AREA
OF
THE
DISK
THAT
WINDOWS
CAN
USE
AND
TO
BLOCK
THAT
SPACE
FROM
DOS
WINDOWS
WOULD
THEORETICALLY
NOT
EVEN
HAVE
TO
ACCESS
THE
FILE
FROM
DOS
TO
USE
THAT
DISK
SPACE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
DOES
OR
DOESNTBUT
IT
CHECKS
FOR
IT
SOMEWHERE
EVERYTIME
YOU
BOOT
WINDOWS
A
TEMPORARY
SWAP
FILE
IS
JUST
A
NORMAL
DOS
FILE
THAT
IS
ACCESSED
BY
WINDOWS
VIA
DOS
AND
THE
BIOS
IF
A
DISK
COMPRESSION
PROGRAM
OR
OTHER
TSR
IS
LOADED
THE
FILE
ACCESS
MUST
GO
THROUGH
DOSTSRS
DISK
COMPRESSIONAND
BIOS
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
ACCESS
IE
NEVER
USE
A
TEMPORARY
SWAP
FILENEVER
MORE
ON
PERMENENT
SWAP
FILES
IM
SURE
EVERYONE
WHO
HAS
AN
UNCOMPRESSED
PART
OF
THEIR
COMPRESSED
HARD
DISK
HAS
SEEN
THE
MESSAGE
YOU
HAVE
SELECTED
A
SWAP
FILE
GREATER
THAN
THE
SUGGESTED
SIZEWINDOWS
WILL
ONLY
USE
THE
SIZE
SUGGESTEDDO
YOU
WANT
TO
CREATE
THIS
SWAP
FILE
ANYWAY
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WELL
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
ROBERT
CALLED
MICROSOFT
AND
ASKED
THEM
WHAT
AND
WHY
WHAT
THEY
SAID
IS
THAT
WINDOWS
CHECKS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
FREE
DISK
SPACE
AND
DIVIDES
THAT
NUMBER
BY
THEN
IT
CHECKS
FOR
THE
LARGEST
CONTIGUOUS
BLOCK
OF
FREE
DISK
SPACE
WINDOWS
THEN
SUGGESTS
THE
SMALLER
OF
THE
TWO
NUMBERS
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
UNDER
ABSOLUTELY
NO
CIRCUMSTANCESNONEWILL
WINDOWS
USES
A
SWAP
FILE
LARGER
THAN
THE
SUGGESTED
SIZE
WELLTHATS
WHAT
HE
SAID
I
CALL
BULL
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
WHY
DOES
WINDOWS
REPORT
THE
MEMORY
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
ME
IF
ITS
NOT
GOING
TO
USE
IT
ANY
TAKERS
JAMES
IF
THIS
DOESNT
GET
TO
THE
NET
WILL
SOMEONE
POST
IT
FOR
ME
THANKS
