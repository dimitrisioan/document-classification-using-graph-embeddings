WRITES
THE
DESKJET
IS
SLOW
THIS
IS
IN
COMPARISON
TO
THE
OTHER
PRINTERS
I
MENTIONED
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
HOW
THE
BUBBLEJET
COMPARES
THE
INTERFACE
BETWEEN
AND
THE
PRINTER
IS
JUST
DANDY
IVE
NOT
HAD
ANY
PROBLEMS
WITH
IT
I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
PRINTER
A
COUPLE
OF
DAYS
AGO
I
COMPARED
IT
TO
THE
SAMPLE
PRINT
OF
AN
HP
DESKJET
AND
KNEW
THAT
THE
HP
WASNT
FOR
ME
THE
IS
PRETTY
FAST
AND
REALLY
PRINTS
WITH
GOOD
QUALITY
I
CAN
COMPARE
IT
WITH
THE
HP
LASERJET
IIID
POSTSCRIPT
AND
THEY
LOOK
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
DEPENDING
ON
THE
KIND
OF
PAPER
I
DONT
HAVE
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
INK
NOT
BEING
DRY
IT
SEEMS
TO
DRY
VERY
FAST
PROBABLY
WITHIN
A
SECOND
SINCE
CANON
IS
GIVING
A
REBATE
UNTIL
THE
END
OF
MAY
IT
IS
REALLY
A
GOOD
BUY
HOW
MUCH
IS
THE
BJ
GOING
FOR
I
GOT
MINE
FOR
WHICH
WAS
IN
THE
END
THE
DECIDING
FACTOR
FOR
ME
