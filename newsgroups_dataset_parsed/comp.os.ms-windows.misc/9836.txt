the
deskjet
is
slow
this
is
in
comparison
to
the
other
printers
i
mentioned
i
have
no
idea
how
the
bubblejet
compares
the
interface
between
and
the
printer
is
just
dandy
ive
not
had
any
problems
with
it
i
just
bought
a
printer
a
couple
of
days
ago
i
compared
it
to
the
sample
print
of
an
hp
deskjet
and
knew
that
the
hp
wasnt
for
me
the
is
pretty
fast
and
really
prints
with
good
quality
i
can
compare
it
with
the
hp
laserjet
iiid
postscript
and
they
look
almost
identical
depending
on
the
kind
of
paper
i
dont
have
problems
with
the
ink
not
being
dry
it
seems
to
dry
very
fast
probably
within
a
second
since
canon
is
giving
a
rebate
until
the
end
of
may
it
is
really
a
good
buy
how
much
is
the
bj
going
for
i
got
mine
for
which
was
in
the
end
the
deciding
factor
for
me
