results
for
different
graphics
cards

excel
xls
format
what
is
the
latest
version
of
winbench

how
do
they
differ

the
source
available
and
has
anybody
try
to
port
it
to
xwindow
at
least
in
a
way
that
will
make
comparisons
possible
on
ftpcicaindianaedu

is
a
writeup
by
steve
gibson
of
infoworld
with

a
number
of
other
benchmark
results
for
nine

is
a
very
current

i
believe
they
try
to
maintain
the
same
rating
scale
between

and
new
versions
are
released
to
defeat
the
lastest
coding
tricks
put
in
