HOW
DOES

MANAGER
DEAL
WITH
MULTIPLE
PRINTERS
WERE
PLANNING
TO
PRINT
TO
TWO
PRINTERS
FROM
AN
APPLICATION
ONE
WILL
BE
A
REAL
PRINTER
AND
THE
OTHER
A
FAX
PROGRAM
WILL
PRINT
MANAGER
JUST
DEAL
WITH
THE
JOBS
ONE
AT
A
TIME
OR
WILL
IT
FEED
TO
BOTH
PRINTERS
AT
ONCE
PLEASE
RESEARCH
CAREFULLY
JUST
BECAUSE
A
FAX
MODEM
BEHAVES
LIKE
A
PRINTER
ON
A
LOCAL
MACHINE
DOESNT
GUARANTEE
FUNCTIONALITY
WHEN
A
LOCAL
MACHINE
HAS
FAX
SOFTWARE
PRINTING
TO
A
REMOTELY
INSTALLED
FAX
CARD
I
TRIED
THIS
WITH
WORKGROUPS
AND
THE
FAX
SOFTWARE
DIDNT
LIKE
IT
AT
ALL
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
WINFAXS
PECULIARISMS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
SO
A
LOT
OF
SPECIAL
HARDWARE
INTERACTION
TAKES
PLACE
INTERNALLY
IN
MY
CASE
A
FAX
MANAGER
PROGRAM
MERELY
INTERCEPTS
THE
PRINT
JOB
AND
SPOOLS
IT
TO
ITS
OWN
DIRECTORY
NOT
PRINT
MANAGERS
SPOOL

IT
APPEARS
THE

PLAYS
NO

IF

IS
WHAT
YOU
WERE
