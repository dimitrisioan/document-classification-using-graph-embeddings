RE
BORLANDS
PARADOX
OFFER
I
AM
CONSIDERING
BUYING
BORLANDS
PARADOX
FOR
WINDOWS
SINCE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
USE
A
DATABASE
WITH
WINDOWS
I
DONT
HAVEUSE
ONE
YET
FOR
BOTH
WORKHOME
USE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ADVANTAGE
OF
BORLANDS
UNTIL
APRIL
OFFER
IF
THIS
PACKAGE
IS
EVERYTHING
THAT
BORLAND
CLAIMS
IT
TO
BE
SO
I
WAS
WONDERING
HAS
ANYBODY
USED
THIS
ANDOR
HAVE
ANY
OPINIONS
TOM
BELMONTE
IVE
BEEN
USING
MS
ACCESS
STILL
AVAILABLE
FROM
SOME
STORES
FOR
AND
I
AM
QUITE
PLEASED
WITH
IT
ITS
RELATIVELY
EASY
TO
LEARN
VERY
EASY
TO
USE
AND
SOMEWHAT
EASY
TO
PROGRAM
I
HIGHLY
RECOMEND
IT
PARTICULARLY
AT
I
HAVE
NOT
USED
PARADOX

WINDOWS
BUT
I
DONT
EXPECT
IT
TO
BE
BETTER
THAN
ACCESS
IMHO
DAVE
