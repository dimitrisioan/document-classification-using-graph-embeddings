FOR

THIS
IS
LONG
I
HAVE
OF
MEMORY
ON
MY
MHZ
AN
INTEL
MATH
COPROCESSOR
AND
A
HARD
DRIVE
WITH
FREE
NO
COMPRESSION
I
HAVE
BEEN
RUNNING
MATHCAD
UNDER
WINDOWS
IN
ENHANCED
MODE
WITH
A
RAM
DRIVE
SMART
DRIVE
AND
NO
SWAP
FILE
PERMANENT
OR
TEMPORARY
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
THE
FASTER
MATHCAD
BUT
I
AM
CONCERNED
ABOUT
REPORTED
SWAP
FILE
REQUIREMENTS
AND
THE
LEGITIMACY
OF
MATHSOFTS
CLAIM
ABOUT
INCREASED
SPEED
TO
USERS
WILL
MATHCAD
RUN
WITHOUT
A
SWAP
FILE
OR
INSIST
THAT
I
USE
A
SWAP
FILE
SO
FAR
IN
RESPONSE
TO
A

A
FUESS
ACCORDING
TO
MATHSOFT
NO
MATHCAD
USES
THE
SWAP

EXTENSIVELY
SO
AS
NOT
TO
OVERBURDEN
THE
PHYSICAL
RESOURCES
THEY
SAY
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
A
FEATURE
A

BERT

IM
NOT
ALL
THAT
CERTAIN
THAT
MATHCAD
IS
THE
CULPRIT
HERE
I
HAVE
A
WITH
OF
MAIN
MEMORY
LESS
FOR
A
RAMDISK
AND
A
BIT
FOR
A
DOS
SESSION
THAT
IS
OPENED
AS
PART
OF
THE
STARTUP
PROCESS
WHICH
I
HAVE
BEEN
RUNNING
WITHOUT
ANY
SWAPFILE
WHEN
I
INSTALLED
THE
SUBSYSTEM
FROM
THE
MARCH
BETA
OF
THE
NT
SDK
THE
SUBSYSTEM
ITSELF
DEMANDED
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
SWAPFILE
THE
ONLY
PROGRAM
IVE
RUN
TO
DATE
IS
THE
VERSION
OF
FREECELL
THAT
CAME
WITH
THAT
SUBSYSTEM
I
GAVE
WINDOWS
A
SMALL
TEMPORARY
SWAPFILE
IM
LEERY
OF

THAT
MUST
REMAIN
IN
FIXED

ON
MY
HARD

MATHCAD
MAKES
USE
OF
THE

YOUVE
PROBABLY
HEARD
ABOUT
IT
IS
A

THAT
PROVIDES

MATHCAD
ABSOLUTELY
REQUIRES
RAM
WITH
SWAP
FILE
OR
RAM
WITH

IT
WILL
GIVE
YOU
A
NOT

ERROR
IF
THE
SWAP

IS
LESS
THAN
IT
IS
A
MAJOR
RESOURCE
HOG
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
LOAD
THE
SYMBOLIC
PROCESSOR
OR
THE
SMART
MATH
IT
TAKES
ABOUT
OF
RAM
REAL
OR
VIRTUAL
JUST
TO
LOAD
AGAIN
DUE
TO
THE
LIBRARIES
SO
IT
SEEMS
THAT
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
SYSTEM
REQUIREMENTS
SHOWN
ON
MATHSOFTS
ADVERTISEMENT
FOR
THAT
YOU
NEED
A
SWAP
FILE
POSSIBLY
AS
BIG
AS
LOOKS
LIKE
I
WOULD
JUST
NEED
AN
SWAP

AND
WOULD
NEED
TO
CHOOSE
OR
CAN
I
BETWEEN
A
FASTER
PERMANENT

OR
A
SLOWER

APPARENTLY
A

IF
YOUVE
GOT
MEGS
OF

WHY
NOT
CONFIGURE
AS
A

DISK
FOR
MATHCAD
DOS
PERMITS
DIFFERENT
BOOTUP
CONFIGURATIONS
CAN
MATHCAD
BE
CONFIGURED
TO
USE
SUCH
A
RAM
DRIVE
INSTEAD
OF
A
SWAP
FILE
IF
NOT
I
DONT
SEE
HOW
USING
DOS
FOR
AN
ALTERNATE
BOOTUP
WOULD
PROVIDE
WINDOWS
WITH
THIS
SWAP
FILE
SOME
TIME
BACK
I
REMEMBER
A
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
THE
ISSUES
OF
USING
A
RAM
DRIVE
TO
SUPPORT
A
SWAP
FILE
BUT
I
THOUGHT
THIS
INVOLVED
SLOWER
SYSTEMS
I
HAVE
DOS
BUT
FOR
VARIOUS
REASONS
HAVE
NOT
YET
DONE
A
FULL
INSTALLATION
BY
THE
WAY
IS
A
FULL
INSTALLATION
OF
DOS
REQUIRED
TO
AVAIL
ONESELF
OF
THE
ALTERNATE
BOOTUP
FEATURE
WHICH
FILES
FROM
THE

DISKS
ARE
REQUIRED
BY
WILDACCESSDIGEXCOM
WILDSTROM
PRESUMEABLY
YOU
MEAN
WITHOUT
A
PERMANENT
SWAP
FILE
IF
WINDOWS
NEEDS
A
SWAP
FILE
IT
WILL
UPO
AND
CREATE
ONE
IF
A
PERMANENT
ONE
DOESNT
EXIST
PERMANENT
IS
GENERALLY
FASTER
THOUGH
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
MATHCAD
WOULDNT
BE
HAPPY
WITH
EITHER
TYPEVER
IS
AND
SO
SHOULD
ANY
PROGRAM
CONFORMING
TO
THE
WIN
SPECIFICATION
SO
FAR
HAS
BEEN
ENOUGH
RAM
TO
AVOID
THE
OVERHEAD
OF
RUNNING
ANY
SWAP
FILE
I
HAVE
BEEN
RUNNING
MATHCAD
UNDER
WINDOWS
WITHOUT
