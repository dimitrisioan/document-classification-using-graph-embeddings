i
have
heard
from
several
people
about
less
expensive
mf
io
cards
with
tsd
systems
for
the
card
plus
per
i
can
vouch
for
this
one
i
ordered
it
and
got
it
for
including
sh
it
took
me
awhile
to
figure
out
how
to
get
it
working
with
my
system
but
since
i
did
i
get
terrific
results
while
downloading
using
pcplus
for
windows
i
used
to
get
errors
if
i
started
any
other
program
while
downloading
at
high
speed
not
anymore
