DOES
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
IS

KEYBOARD
SHORTCUT
I
AM
QUITE
FAST
WITH
THE
PC
KEYBOARD
AND
I
USUALLY
USE
ALL
FINGERS

DIGIT
SO
WHEN
I
USE
A
EDITOR
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
LEAVE
THE
KEYBOARD
AND
USE
THE
MOUSE
EVERY
TIME
I
NEED
A
SPECIAL
FUNCTION
ON
THE
MENU
OR
TO
USE
THE
ARROW
KEYS
THAT
ARE
AWAY
FROM
THE
USUAL
POSITION
OF
MY
HANDS
ON
THE
KEYBOARD
IN
MY
SITUATION
VI
IS
VERY
POWERFUL
AND
IM
SEARCHING

WINDOWS

THE
BAD
ENGLISH
