re
can
i
change
licensed
to
data
in
windows
in
writes
ahh
yes
this
is
a
fun
topic
no
once
the
name
is
incribed
on
the
disk
that
is
it
it
is
encoded
not
even
a
hex
editor
will
find
it
you
can
but
a
disk
compare
utility
old
versus
new
will
and
windows
is
also
flexible
enough
at
install
time
that
you
can
copy
all
the
files
onto
your
hard
disk
which
greatly
speeds
things
up
and
makes
them
less
annoying
if
you
can
spare
the
or
so
compressed
megs
write
over
the
licensed
to
but
you
cant
change
the
name
underneth
it
i
think
if
you
wish
to
change
this
you
would
have
to
be
a
pirate
and
were
not
going
to
promote
that
here
no
were
not
but
were
also
not
going
to
promote
pandering
to
corporate
paranoia
when
the
real
issue
is
convenience
i
dont
like
dealing
with
floppies
personally
i
have
no
use
for
changing
the
registration
info
but
i
see
it
as
a
valid
need
and
one
that
ought
to
be
solved
using
a
quick
little
utility
rather
than
a
halfhour
reinstall
thats
just
about
guaranteed
to
mess
up
your
settings
in
one
way
or
another
so
while
im
not
going
to
put
much
time
into
it
myself
heres
the
procedure
for
getting
on
your
way
to
finding
the
encoded
information
copy
all
your
windows
disks
into
the
directory
from
which
you
want
to
install
it
ive
been
using
cwinstall
myself
from
there
copy
that
directory
to
something
like
cwinorig
install
from
cwinstall
comp
the
two
directories
to
determine
changes
ie
comp
winorig
reporttxt
look
in
the
report
file
for
the
files
that
change
assuming
they
didnt
cover
themselves
covering
their
own
tracks
at
least
one
file
should
have
a
difference
noted
at
a
particular
offset
locate
said
offset
in
the
original
directory
and
see
whats
there
using
a
hex
editor
and
do
the
same
for
the
modified
one
youre
on
your
own
as
far
as
breaking
the
code
goes
i
dont
really
do
cryptography
its
probably
just
an
xor
key
or
something
i
think
ms
is
more
concerned
with
joe
schmoe
at
the
office
personalizing
his
copy
than
with
real
pirates
who
will
probably
just
disassemble
the
damned
thing
anyway
this
technique
should
work
with
just
about
any
obnoxious
corporate
product
that
tries
to
write
to
the
original
floppies
when
you
install
in
some
extreme
cases
you
may
not
be
able
to
back
the
floppies
up
to
hard
disk
and
will
be
stuck
doing
a
compare
on
floppies
lotus
stuff
is
probably
like
that
as
i
noted
before
if
you
can
afford
the
space
on
the
hard
disk
and
dont
do
much
in
the
way
of
customization
reinstalling
from
one
directory
to
another
may
be
less
arduous
doing
some
of
the
stuff
ive
mentioned
here
may
well
void
your
license
with
microsoft
as
if
theyd
ever
find
out
if
you
arent
careful
with
the
disk
editor
you
could
also
mung
something
important
duh
i
guess
thats
a
