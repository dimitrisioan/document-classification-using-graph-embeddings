finally
in
order
to
run
your
specific
version
of
windows
you
must
simply
change
the
path
to
include
cwinmastr
and
your
specific
configuration
path
eg
cwinwife
you
could
get
fancy
and
use
batch
files
environment
variables
or
a
menuing
system
to
do
this
other
stuff
delete
if
you
happen
to
be
running
the
new
msdos
you
could
use
multi
setup
to
provide
a
menu
with
a
menu
choice
for
each
person
using
the
machine
power
up
select
your
name
the
menu
will
use
your
personal
sections
of
configsys
and
autoexecbat
thus
setting
up
the
path
then
running
your
windows
copy

excellent
suggestion
ron
and
as
a
further
comment
on
dos
if
you
decide
to
install
windows
standalone
configuration
completely
in
more
than
directory
on
your
hard
drive
and
use
dos
to
jump
to
a
specific
copy
for
each
user
you
could
be
saving
yourself
many
megs
of
disk
space
if
you
use
the
setup
n
and
