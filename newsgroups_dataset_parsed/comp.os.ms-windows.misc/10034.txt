summary
canon
vs
hp
deskjet
hello
again
about
a
week
and
onehalf
ago
i
posted
a
query
looking
for
people
feelings
on
the
inkjet
family
of
printers
specifically
a
comparison
between
the
canon
bubblejet
and
the
hewlettpackard
deskjet
many
people
asked
me
to
post
the
summaryaccount
of
all
the
postings
and
email
i
received
below
is
my
original
query
and
the
responses
i
received
i
have
not
deleted
any
part
of
the
responses
only
the
headers
and
signatures
so
you
can
extract
what
you
find
necessary
some
people
asked
me
for
an
unbiased
account
however
the
very
nature
of
the
question
suggests
favoritism
and
biased
comments
you
must
extract
the
information
you
believe
unbiased
and
a
fair
representation
of
each
printer
there
are
a
wide
range
of
comments
each
has
its
own
value
there
was
no
clear
winner
some
like
the
especially
its
priceperformance
ratio
others
preferred
the
durability
and
reliability
of
the
deskjet
the
original
inkjet
with
proven
drivers
and
a
solid
background
two
new
inkjet
printers
have
drawn
some
attention
a
new
printer
to
be
introduced
by
hewlettpackard
later
this
year
around
summertime
and
an
addition
to
the
epson
product
line
their
first
inkjet
you
will
find
that
after
the
initial
purchase
the
costs
of
refilling
or
replacing
the
ink
cartridges
are
about
the
same
this
largely
depends
on
where
you
purchase
the
refills
or
replacements
so
shop
around
first
since
this
aspect
will
most
likely
dominate
the
cost
of
your
printer
no
one
mentioned
approx
how
many
sheets
each
ink
cartridge
will
print
but
i
suspect
they
are
roughly
equal
at
about
sheets
laser
printers
will
do
sheets
per
toner
cartridge
well
thats
a
brief
research
summary
of
my
personal
research
enjoy
hello
fellow
netters
i
am
asking
for
your
collected
wisdom
to
help
me
decide
which
printer
i
should
purchase
the
canon
bubblejet
vs
the
hp
deskjet
i
thought
rather
than
trust
the
salesperson
i
would
benefit
more
from
relying
on
those
who
use
these
printers
daily
and
use
them
to
their
fullest
potential
and
i
figure
all
of
you
will
know
their
benefits
and
pitfalls
better
than
any
salesperson
now
i
would
greatly
appreciate
any
information
you
could
render
on
the
dpi
of
the
canon
bubblejet
vs
the
hewlettpackard
deskjet
dpi
which
is
faster
is
there
a
noticeable
print
quality
difference
particularly
in
graphics
which
will
handle
large
documents
better
pages
or
more
any
personal
experience
on
either
will
be
appreciated
here
which
works
better
under
windows
any
driver
problems
etc
cost
of
memory
font
packages
toner
cartridges
etc
basically
your
personal
experiences
with
either
of
these
machines
is
highly
desirable
both
good
and
bad
well
i
bought
the
bj
about
a
month
ago
at
the
start
of
their
rebate
program
on
that
printer
it
ends
and
i
bought
it
from
computer
discount
warehouse
because
their
price
of
couldnt
be
beat
anywhere
i
looked
and
i
think
its
a
hot
printer
just
using
regular
copier
paper
produced
fantastic
results
just
in
high
quality
mode
i
compared
the
output
of
a
micrografx
designer
legal
size
drawing
with
type
done
on
my
bj
with
the
same
drawing
printed
on
an
hp
laserjet
iid
and
i
was
amazed
how
well
i
could
read
the
small
print
on
the
bj
printing
speed
was
several
seconds
faster
on
the
bj
which
is
amazing
considering
that
the
hp
has
ram
installed
i
measured
the
time
from
when
the
printer
first
indicated
it
was
receiving
data
as
i
used
print
manager
in
windows
i
showed
the
output
to
several
people
at
work
and
one
manager
bought
one
immediately
for
his
office
and
two
other
engineers
placed
their
orders
too
if
you
need
cdws
phone
number
its
delivery
to
ny
was
two
days
good

i
own
a
deskjet
performance
isnt
spectacular
under
windows
using
truetype
fonts
but
neither
is
the
canon
from
what
i
have
seen
quality
for
the
hp
is
very
much
dependent
on
paper
quality
on
standard
photocopy
paper
the
characters
have
slightly
frayed
edges
but
on
better
quality
distinction
type
paper
things
look
better
for
most
applications
i
find
copy
paper
fine
still
better
than
dotmatrix
comes
with
a
windows
driver
which
seems
to
bypass
print
manager
has
a
few
intellifontswhich
are
hp
scaleable
fonts
probably
faster
than
truetype
but
havent
really
tried
them
out
can
get
ram
font
cartridges
but
unless
the
speed
of
truetype
is
a
problem
i
wouldnt
bother
the
ram
cartridges
cant
be
used
as
buffer
soft
fonts
only
for
graphics
ie
bmp
images
etc
the
hp
can
be
put
into
a
dither
mode
via
the
hp
supplied
win
driver
there
a
number
of
dither
options
such
as
scatter
pattern
etc
the
manual
gives
recommendations
depending
on
the
type
of
image
being
printed
text
is
not
so
good
in
this
mode
problem
arises
when
you
have
a
document
which
contains
both
graphic
and
text
the
range
of
tones
for
graphic
images
isnt
brilliant
but
i
think
that
is
more
of
a
limitation
with
inkjet
printers
in
general
from
what
i
have
seen
the
canon
is
similar
in
most
respects
however
a
printer
definitely
worth
looking
at
is
the
new
inkjet
from
epson
this
printer
is
faster
cheaper
and
capable
of
producing
laserlike
quality
on
normal
copier
paper
cant
remember
the
model
lx
something
i
think
i
purchased
my
hp
days
before
the
epson
was
released
here
the
introductory
price
on
the
epson
was
the
same
as
the
hp
here
in
new
zealand
about
a
month
ago
i
got
a
canon
i
absolutely
love
it
it
is
incredibly
fast
except
for
printing
from
pspice
i
dont
know
if
you
ever
do
stuff
with
that
or
not
most
of
the
stuff
i
print
is
either
from
microsoft
word
for
windows
or
just
plain
text
the
only
problems
ive
had
are
printing
headersfooters
the
printer
freaked
out
and
printing
on
cheap
paper
lots
of
streaks
normal
copy
paper
works
great
with
it
you
can
only
tell
its
not
laserprinted
by
holding
it
oh
less
than
twelve
inches
from
your
face
that
is
if
youre
nearsighted
like
me
the
printer
comes
with
its
own
driver
for
windows
i
have
no
other
complaints
the
printer
also
can
act
just
like
some
epson
or
another
for
those
archaic
software
packages
that
havent
written
a
driver
for
it
yet
the
teenyweeny
footprint
is
a
real
plus
tooand
if
you
purchase
it
between
now
and
may
you
get
a
rebate
from
canon
i
bought
mine
from
a
store
called
compusa
and
the
price
now
is
i
have
a
friend
who
has
the
hp
you
are
looking
at
it
also
prints
very
well
and
everyone
has
drivers
for
it
but
it
is
very
slow
hope
i
helped
sure
looks
great

i

i
have
some

with

i
have
a
at
work
and
a
deskjet
at
home
i
prefer
the
deskjet
the
printing
speed
and
quality
are
similar
i
tested
both
with
text
and
graphics
before
buying
the
deskjet
for
home
the
feature
that
sets
the
deskjet
apart
is
the
driver
support
in
so
many
applications
the
bj
ends
up
emulating
the
epson
lq
or
ibm
proprinter
to
get
it
to
work
with
many
nonwindows
apps
and
this
will
be
the
case
for
a
long
time
the
design
is
superior
if
you
just
want
to
use
cut
paper
the
deskjet
is
quieter
and
the
ink
cartridges
are
quite
a
bit
cheaper
due
to
the
number
of
deskjets
out
there
in
comparision
to
the
bjs
just
my

yes
there
is
the
landscape
mode
printing
problem
but
it
does
not
present
a
problem
in
windows
as
the
windows
printer
driver
handles
the
translation
i
actually
thought
of
some
other
points
after
i
posted
the
note
the
deskjet
has
an
unprintable
area
of
approximately
around
the
paper
the
bubblejet
does
not
you
are
right
about
the
graphics
resolutions
i
tested
the
printers
with
the
applications
i
had
access
to
wordperfect
harvard
graphics
wingif
paintshop
pro
and
paintbrush
and
could
not
tell
a
difference
in
fact
one
of
the
hp
deskjet
windows
drivers
gives
you
significant
control
over
the
contrast
and
density
of
the
printer
hence
controlling
the
amount
of
ink
you
put
down
the
bubblejet
did
not
i
had
no
imaging
software
to
test
the
printers
with
and
so
had
no
comparision
there
finally
i
wanted
sheet
feeding
in
that
configuration
the
bubblejet
cost
approximately
more
than
the
deskjet
i
went
through
a
pretty
thorough
evaluation
and
chose
the
deskjet
when
i
spent
my
own
money
btw
i
am
replacing
the
with
a
deskjet
at
work
this
month
anyway
regards
mike

la
i
spent
some
time
comparing
the
two
we
ended
up
getting
the
bubblejet
versus
the
hp
our
reasons
were
the
hp
seemed
to
have
worse
banding
than
the
canon
versus
we
felt
we
could
see
the
difference
price
canon
has
a
rebate
program
going
on
at
the
moment
the
was
our
choice
over
the
we
could
have
pages
in
the
feeder
the
holds
only
pages
i
think
as
you
can
see
up
to
pages
on
the
we
havent
done
anything
big
with
the
bj
but
its
performance
seems
reasonable
under
windows
i
know
that
the
microsoft
bbs
has
a
newer
windows
driver
than
comes
with
the
printer
but
i
dont
know
how
it
compares
also
the
driver
included
with
the
printer
is
canons
whereas
i
dont
know
where
the
microsoft
bbs
one
comes
from
microsoft
hope
this
helps

altough
im
sometimes
also
a
salesperson
if
im
not
suppost
to
study
i
would
recommend
to
buy
the
the
printing
quality
is
a
bit
better
but
you
youve
got
much
more
possiblities
dont
forget
the
hp
engine
is
at
least
years
on
the
marked
the
canon
engine
witch
is
also
used
in
other
new
bubblejet
printers
like
eg
the
epson
ones
is
quite
recently
available
now
i
would
greatly
appreciate
any
information
you
could
render
on
the
dpi
of
the
canon
bubblejet
vs
the
hewlettpackard
deskjet
dpi
which
is
faster
is
there
a
noticeable
print
quality
difference
particularly
in
graphics
which
will
handle
large
documents
better
ive
seen
during
a
short
demonstration
from
someone
who
tryed
to
sell
me
canon
printers
times
the
same
picture
one
printed
with
the
one
with
the
canon
the
other
with
the
hp
and
there
was
a
difference
in
printing
quality
the
canon
was
a
bit
better
greetz
kris
when
we
decided
we
needed
quiet
printers
in
our
hospital
we
looked
to
inkjet
printers
they
have
near
laser
quality
speed
and
they
are
quiet
we
use
both
hp
deskjets
and
the
canon
i
prefer
the
paper
handling
qualities
of
the
deskjets
but
i
feel
the
canons
have
superior
print
quality
the
ideal
would
be
a
canon
with
a
sheet
feeder
however
i
did
end
up
buying
a
deskjet
for
home
use
got
too
good
a
deal
anyway
we
are
using
canons
in
high
volume
areas
and
they
are
holding
up
very
well
out
of
deskjets
and
i
have
only
had
one
problem
with
a
deskjet
and
that
was
taken
care
of
very
quickly
by
hp
nate
whenever
i
buy
anything
i
look
at
what
the
experts
say
pick
out
the
top
few
and
then
buy
on
whatever
criteria
are
the
most
apt
ive
been
unusually
flush
lately
no
begging
letter
please
and
so
ive
done
this
a
few
times
including
about
four
months
ago
with
inkjet
printers
i
cant
remember
much
about
the
process
except
that
i
read
about
three
reviews
of
inkjets
and
that
the
was
always
at
or
near
the
top
i
bought
the
because
of
the
added
dimension
of
colour
i
intend
to
build
a
multi
media
machine
at
some
stage
and
have
just
bought
a
colour
scanner
towards
that
although
i
havens
used
the
colour
thing
in
earnest
yet
i
tried
it
out
on
a
couple
of
windows
bitmaps
and
i
was
pleased
with
the
result
i
note
that
even
though
you
can
now
get
the
the
one
with
both
colour
and
mono
with
no
need
to
change
the
cartridge
the
and
are
still
readily
available
at
least
in
the
uk
the
following
are
my
viewsexperience
i
dont
know
anything
about
the
canon
except
that
i
came
away
from
reviews
and
replies
to
a
posting
similar
to
yours
with
the
idea
that
the
hp
offered
the
best
performanceprice
ratio
i
believe
hp
are
the
originals
in
the
field
not
always
the
ideal
place
to
be
but
the
markets
still
young
so
one
assumes
they
have
the
expertise
the
is
worth
the
extra
operation
in
mono
is
perfectly
acceptable
and
i
get
good
crisp
reproduction
of
fonts
from
windows
i
used
to
work
for
monotype
when
they
still
manufactured
typesetters
before
their
american
owners
closed
them
down
and
i
can
tell
you
that
in
terms
of
definition
dpi
is
pretty
poor
anyway
so
dpi
is
just
a
bit
less
poor
the
hp
comes
with
a
reasonable
set
of
drivers
if
you
buy
it
invest
in
the
additional
ram
pack
its
pretty
slow
with
it
god
knows
what
its
like
without
i
actually
work
in
germany
and
my
pc
is
home
in
the
uk
so
its
not
in
daily
use
i
would
say
that
apart
from
my
not
reading
the
manual
properly
and
having
a
really
dumb
problem
at
the
start
its
easy
peasy
to
operate
hope
this
is
of
use
regards
david
just
bought
the
i
thought
the
price
couldnt
be
beat
with
rebate
thru
and
so
far
it
is
comparable
even
superior
to
the
deskjet
in
print
quality
speed
per
page
rate
seems
to
be
faster
i
dont
have
figures
i
dont
print
long
docs
though
quality
i
think
the
graphics
quality
is
excellent
print
quality
is
excellent
as
well
unless
you
use
small
fonts
and
hold
it
up
close
you
can
see
a
lot
more
jaggies
than
on
a
laserjet
the
dpi
is
offset
by
a
little
less
accuracy
in
holding
the
pageprint
head
in
place
i
would
imagine
large
docs
not
room
in
the
standard
model
for
a
whole
lotta
pages
manual
says
up
to
though
havent
tried
it
drivers
no
problems
under
yet
winword
doesnt
want
to
print
the
envelopes
the
same
way
the

does
though
know
nothing

ask
me
about
rotaract
the
deskjet
is
slow
this
is
in
comparison
to
the
other
printers
i
mentioned
i
have
no
idea
how
the
bubblejet
compares
the
interface
between
and
the
printer
is
just
dandy
ive
not
had
any
problems
with
it
i
just
bought
a
printer
a
couple
of
days
ago
i
compared
it
to
the
sample
print
of
an
hp
deskjet
and
knew
that
the
hp
wasnt
for
me
the
is
pretty
fast
and
really
prints
with
good
quality
i
can
compare
it
with
the
hp
laserjet
iiid
postscript
and
they
look
almost
identical
depending
on
the
kind
of
paper
i
dont
have
problems
with
the
ink
not
being
dry
it
seems
to
dry
very
fast
probably
within
a
second
since
canon
is
giving
a
rebate
until
the
end
of
may
it
is
really
a
good
buy

wow
its
funny
you
should
ask
this
im
a
little
behind
in
news
reading
so
i
know
this
may
be
late
i
just
purchased
the
canon
bubblejet
last
night
i
was
really
worried
that
i
wouldnt
like
it
but
the
print
quality
and
noise
level
is
fantastic
i
printed
quite
a
few
documents
with
lots
of
graphics
and
it
printed
damn
near
laser
quality
you
cant
tell
its
not
laser
unless
you
get
inches
from
the
page
no
problems
with
drivers
the
printer
came
with
the
driver
diskette
which
is
good
because
i
was
beginning
to
panic
when
i
couldnt
findi
it
under
windows
or
wordperfect
it
works
well
under
both
i
have
yet
to
install
word
for
windows
so
dont
know
how
it
works
with
them
i
had
a
deskjet
at
work
last
year
it
was
a
good
printer
as
well
ut
i
felt
it
was
awfully
slow
and
much
noisier
than
the
bubblejet
i
wont
say
the
bubblejet
is
much
better
but
i
really
do
like
it
more
just
my
worth
