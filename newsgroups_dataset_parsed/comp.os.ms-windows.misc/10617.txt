wrk
installation
oddity
last
night
i
tried
to
reinstall
the
utilities
from
the
windows
resource
kit
disk
the
setup
program
appeared
to
run
perfectly
normally
but
when
it
had
finished
there
was
no
program
group
created
now
i
know
ive
done
this
before
successfully
and
creating
a
group
myself
didnt
exactly
tax
me
but
im
curious
as
to
what
might
be
going
on
i
can
only
assume
that
something
left
over
from
the
last
time
i
had
it
installed
is
getting
in
the
way
but
i
cant
figure
out
what
any
clues
anyone
