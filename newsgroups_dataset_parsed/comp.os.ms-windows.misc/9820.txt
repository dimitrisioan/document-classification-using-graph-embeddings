SAMUEL
E
WIGGINS
WRITES
BTW
HOW
WOULD
YOU
RATE
THE
NEW
BORLAND
TURBO
C
VISUAL
EDITION
FOR
WINDOWS
ANYONE
TIME
FOR
A
NEW
DISCUSSION
MAYBE
I
ASKED
IN
THESE
GROUPS
SOME
TIME
AGO
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
TCVE
AND
GOT
NO
ANSWERS
SO
I
DECIDED
TO
TRY
MY
BROTHER
WHO
LIVES
IN
THE
US
BOUGHT
AND
SENT
IT
TO
ME
AND
IM
STILL
TRYING
TO
GET
USED
TO
IT
BEFORE
I
PUT
MY
GOODBAD
POINTS
LIST
CONSIDER
I
AM
A
TURBO
PASCALDOS
PROGRAMMER
AND
SOMETIMES
TRY
TO
MAKE
SOMETHING
IN
UNIX
WITH
C
JUST
SOME
EXERCISES
FROM
UNIVERSITY
I
USED
TO
MAKE
SOME
PROGRAMS
IN
MICROSOFT
C
VERSION
BECAUSE
WE
USED
SOME
THIRDPARTY
LIBRARIES
THAT
REQUIRED
THAT
I
LIKE
BORLAND
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
MUCH
MORE
EASIER
TO
USE
THAN
MICROSOFT
SPECIALLY
THE
DEBUGGER
I
TRIED
TO
LEARN
CODEVIEW
SOMETIMES
BUT
NEVER
FELT
CONFORTABLE
WITH
IT
TC
VE
SEEMS
VERY
NICE
TO
CREATE
SIMPLE
APPS
LIKE
THE
EXAMPLES
ON
THE
OBJECTWINDOWS
BOOK
SO
FAR
NO
PROBLEMS
LETS
SEE
NEXT
WEEK
OR
SO
WHEN
I
WILL
TRY
SOMETHING
MORE
COMPLEX
IT
WORKS
NICE
EVEN
IN
MY
WEAK
MACHINE
MB
RAM
BUT
THE
MANUAL
FOR
THE
RESOURCE
WORKSHOP
SEEMS
TO
BE
FROM
A
DIFFERENT
VERSION
FROM
THE
WORKSHOP
ITSELF
SOME
OF
THE
WINDOWS
THAT
APPEAR
ON
THE
MANUAL
HAVE
MORE
ITENS
THAN
IN
THE
MANUAL
I
THINK
I
WILL
RUN
INTO
TROUBLE
SINCE
I
GOT
THIS
TCVE
FROM
MY
BROTHER
AS
A
PRESENT
I
DIDNT
WANTED
TO
BUY
THE
JAPANESE
VERSION
BECAUSE
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
MANUALS
WILL
BE
IN
JAPANESE
AND
I
BELIEVE
IT
WILL
BE
FAR
MORE
EXPENSIVE
HERE
SO
HE
BOUGHT
IT
AS
A
PRESENT
AND
SENT
TO
ME
I
SEND
THE
REGISTRATION
CARD
TO
THE
JAPANESE
BRANCH
OF
BORLAND
BUT
WHO
KNOWS
SO
ID
LIKE
TO
ASK
SOME
QUESTIONS
FOR
YOU
ALL
I
KNOW
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
MICROSOFT
GUYS
AROUND
HERE
IN
THIS
GROUP
IS
THERE
ANYBODY
FROM
BORLAND
IS
THERE
ANY
EMAIL
ADDRESS
THAT
WE
CAN
CONTACT
THE
TECHNICAL
SUPPORT
NOT
FOR
STUPID
QUESTIONS
BUT
TO
ASK
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHY
THE
RW
MANUAL
SEEMS
TO
BE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
RW
ITSELF
IS
THERE
ANYBODY
ELSE
USING
IT
AROUND
HERE
WILL
THE
BOOK
OF
PETZOLD
BE
USEFUL
FOR
ME
I
INTEND
TO
USE
RW
AND
PROTOGEN
TO
MAKE
THE
INTERFACES
AND
THEN
WORK
ON
THE
CODE
ITSELF
ANSWERS
TO
MY
EMAIL
OR

PLEASE
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
