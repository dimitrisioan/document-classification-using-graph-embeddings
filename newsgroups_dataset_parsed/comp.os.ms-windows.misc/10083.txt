OBSERVATION
FLOPPY
COPY
WORKS
UNDER
PGM
MGR
BUT
NOT
DOS
SHELL
HAS
ANYONE
OBSERVED
THIS
IF
I
COPY
A
LARGE
SAY
FILE
A
LARGE
PKZIP
FILE
FOR
INSTANCE
TO
MY
FLOPPY
DRIVE
UNDER
MS
WINDOWS
VIA
EITHER
PROGRAM
MANAGER
OR
A
DOS
SHELL
THE
FILE
COPIED
UNDER
THE
DOS
SHELL
HAS
ERRORS
WHEREAS
THE
FILE
COPIED
FROM
WITHIN
PROGRAM
MANAGER
DOES
NOT
THE
CORRUPTION
IS
DETECTED
BY
EXECUTING
PKUNZIP
T
BFILEZIP
AFTER
BOTH
COPIES
THE
FILE
COPIED
VIA
THE
DOS
SHELL
ALWAYS
SHOWS
CORRUPTION
NOW
HERES
THE
KICKER
I
HAVE
MANY
WINDOWS
OPEN
WHILE
DOING
THIS
BOTH
DOS
AND
WINDOWS
APPS
SUPPOSEDLY
ALL
WINDOWS
APPS
SHARE
THE
SAME
TIME
SLICE
WHEREAS
THE
DOS
APPS
GET
THEIR
OWN
EQUAL
TIME
SLICE
UNLESS
OVERRIDEN
SO
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
I
HAVE
WINDOWS
APPS
OPEN
MULTITASKING
DOS
SESSIONS
RUNNING
AND
ONE
EXECUTIONEXECLUSIVE
DOS
SHELL
ICONIZED
INACTIVE
UNDER
THIS
SCENARIO
CPU
TIME
IS
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
MAJOR
SLICES
ONE
FOR
ALL
THE
WINDOWS
APPS
AND
ONE
SLICE
FOR
THE
RUNNING
DOS
APP
WHEN
COPYING
UNDER
WINDOWS
PGM
MGR
ILL
ASSUME
THE
OTHER
WINDOWS
AND
DOS
TASKS
ARE
ESSENTIALLY
INACTIVE
THUS
PGM

GETS

AND
OF

DOS

THUS
IT

WHEN

I

NO

THE

OR

WHY

I
