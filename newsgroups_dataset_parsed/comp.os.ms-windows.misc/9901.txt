VB
TO
MSACCESS
DDE
COMMUNICATIONS
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKS
AGO
I
POSTED
A
QUESTION
CONCERNING
COMMUNICATING
BETWEEN
VB
AND
MSACCESS
USING
DDE
THE
ANSWERS
I
RECEIVED
AT
THAT
TIME
ALLOWED
ME
TO
GET
A
PROTOTYPE
OF
MY
PROJECT
WORKING
HOWEVER
DURING
THIS
PROCESS
I
HAVE
COME
UP
WITH
NEW
PROBLEMS
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
LIMIT
OF
CHARACTERS
FOR
A
DDE
TOPIC
STRING
IS
THIS
INHERENT
IN
ALL
DDE
SYSTEMS
OR
JUST
PECULIAR
TO
MSACCESS
OR
VB
IT
IS
EASY
TO
QUERY
AN
ACCESS
DATABASE
FROM
VB
USING
THE
DDE
SQL
COMMAND
PROVIDED
THE
ABOVE
LIMITATION
IS
OVERCOME
BY
USING
SHORT
FIELD
AND
TABLE
NAMES
BUT
HOW
IS
ONE
MEANT
TO
UPDATE
A
DATABASE
A
A
DDE
SQL
UPDATE
COMMAND
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
WORK
B
INITIATING
AN
ACCESS
MACRO
USING
A
DDE
EXECUTE
COMMAND
FROM
VB
CANNOT
BE
USED
BECAUSE
WHEN
THE
MACRO
REQUESTS
INFORMATION
FROM
VB
USING
A
SECOND
DDE
CHANNEL
THE
PROGRAMS
DEAD
LOCK
UNTIL
TIME
OUTS
OCCUR
THE
VB
TO
ACCESS
CHANNEL
HAS
TO
CLOSE
BEFORE
THE
ACCESS
TO
VB
CHANNEL
IS
INITIATED
I
GUESS
C
ACCESS
DOES
NOT
ALLOW
VB
TO
DDE
POKE
THE
INFORMATION
THE
WAY
I
EVENTUALLY
MANAGED
TO
UPDATE
A
DATABASE
WAS
BY
SENDING
KEY
STROKES
FROM
VB
TO
ACCESS
USING
THE
SENDKEYS
COMMAND
THIS
TECHNIQUE
HAS
THE
PROBLEM
THAT
ACCESS
CANNOT
BE
MINIMISED
AND
IT
MUST
ALWAYS
BE
IN
A
STATE
READY
TO
RESPOND
TO
THE
SEQUENCE
OF
KEYSTROKES
VB
SENDS
ARE
ALL
THE
ABOVE
STATEMENTS
CORRECT
OR
HAVE
I
MADE
INCORRECT
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
THERE
ANY
BETTER
WORK
AROUNDS
TO
THE
ABOVE
ARE
THERE
ANY
SIGNS
OF
AN
ODBC
DRIVER
FOR
ACCESS
