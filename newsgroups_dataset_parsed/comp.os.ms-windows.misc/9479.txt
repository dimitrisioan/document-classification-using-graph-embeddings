WHAT
IS
WINDOWS

A
REAL
WINDOWS

THIS
PAST
WEEKEND
A
LOCAL
HACKER
RADIO
SHOW
METIONED
A
NEW
PRODUCT
FROM
MICROSOFT
CALLED
CHICAGO
IF
I
RECALL
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
THIS
IS
THAT
IS
IT
THANKS
A
HEAP
ALAN
WINDOWS
NT
IS
A
GIANT
WINDOWS
OPERATING
SYSTEM
UNLINE
IT
DOES
NOT
RUN
ON
TOP
OF
DOS
IT
IS
ITS
OWN
OS
WITH
BILLY
GATES
ASSURES
US
TRUE
MULTITASKINGMULTITHREADING
MEETS
DOD
SECURITY
SPECS
WILL
RUN
PROGRAMS
AS
WELL
AS
DOS
PROGRAMS
HAS
MULTIPROCESSOR
SUPPORT
AND
IS
PRIMARILY
A
SERVER
PROGRAM
ITS
OVERHEAD
IS
TOO
HIGH
FOR
IT
TO
BE
ECONOMICAL
FOR
MOST
USERS
SPEAKING
OF
OVERHEAD
IT
REQUIRES
AT
LEAST
A
WITH
MEGS
OF
RAM
IT
IWLL
RUN
WITH
BUT
THATS
LIKE
RUNNING
WITH
MEGS
AND
THATS
JUST
TO
RUN
IT
ALSO
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THE
SYSTEM
FILES
TAKE
UP
MEGS
AND
IT
IS
RECOMMENDED
THAT
YOUR
DRIVE
BE
A
HALF
GIG
THE
SKD
IS
DISTRIBUTED
ON
CDROM
CHICOGO
IS
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
USE
IT
IS
LIKE
NT
A
TRUE
OS
WITH
THRUE
MULTITASKING
AND
MULTITHREADING
BUT
HAS
MUCH
SMALLER
HARDWARE
REQUIREMENTS
AND
DOES
NOT
MEET
DOD
SECURITY
SPECS
BUT
THATS
OKAY
SINCE
IT
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
MORE
OF
A
CLIENT
OS
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
OTEHR
DIFFERENCES
BUT
THOSE
ARE
THE
MAIN
ONES
THERE
WAS
AN
ARTICLE
ABOUT
CHICOGO
IN
PC
WEEK
LAST
AUGUST
THE
CHICOGO
AND
NT
DEVELOPMENT
GROUPS
AT
MICROOFT
ARE
IN
INTENSE
COMPETITION
SO
IT
IS
SAID
HOWEVER
I
THINK
A
DIFFERENT
RELATIONSHIP
WILL
ARISE
NT
WILL
BE
THE
SERVER
NETOWRK
TECHONOLOGY
CHICOGO
WILL
BE
THE
CLIENT
MACHINE
IT
IS
ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE
FOR
DIFFERENT
OSS
TO
WORK
TOGETHER
PARTLY
BECAUSE
CHICOGO
IS
JUST
A
SMALL
NT
THINK
OF
IT
THAT
WAY
ANYWAY
NOVELL
NETWARE
CREATES
AN
OS
ON
THE
SERVER
THAT
IS
TRULY
NOT
DOS
SO
DONT
SCORN
THE
CONCEPT
ANYWAY
DONT
EXPECT
IT
SOON
WINDOWS
AND
DOS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
RELEASED
NEXT
YEAR
READ
SEE
IT
IN
SO
I
EXPECT
THAT
CHICOGO
WONT
BE
OUT
TIL
WITH
LUCK
ILL
BE
PROVEN
WRONG
