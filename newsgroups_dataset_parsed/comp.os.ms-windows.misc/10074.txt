LOCAL
WINDOWS
VS
SHARED
WINDOWS
DISCUSSION
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
A
SERIOUS
DISCUSSION
ON
THE
BEST
WAY
TO
INSTALL
WINDOWS
FROM
A
NOVELL
ADMINISTRATORS
POINT
OF
VIEW
I
JUST
GOT
OFF
THE
PHONE
WITH
MS
ACCESS
SUPPORT
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THEY
MICROSOFT
HAS
DECIDED
TO
IMPLEMENT
AS
A
STANDARD
FOR
SOFTWARE
SUPPORT
THE
LOCAL
SETUP
DESCRIBED
BELOW
AS
THE
MOST
ADVANTAGEOUS
INSTALLATION
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
AND
MICROSOFT
DEEMS
THIS
TO
BE
THE
MOST
PRUDENT
INSTALLATION
THEN
I
WILL
COMPLY
BUT
ID
LIKE
TO
HEAR
IT
FROM
ADMINISTRATORS
FIRST
THE
LOCAL
WINDOWS
INSTALLATION
WINDOWS
IS
FULLY
INSTALLED
ON
EACH
WORKSTATION
HARD
DRIVE
ASSUMING
THE
RESOURCES
ARE
AVAILABLE
FROM
A
NETWORK
ADMINISTRATORS
IMPLEMENTATION
HESHE
WOULD
INSTALL
ALL
WINDOWS
DISKS
ON
A
NETWORK
DRIVE
USING
SETUPA
THEN
INSTALL
WINDOWS
ON
A
PERMACHINE
BASES
BY
RUNNING
SETUP
OFF
THE
NETWORK
TO
INSTALL
THE
COMPLETE
SYSTEM
ON
THE
LOCAL
DRIVES
IN
THIS
WAY
ALL
DRIVERS
ARE
AVAILABLE
TO
THE
SETUP
PROCEDURE
WO
THE
NEED
TO
CHANGE
DISKS
ADVANTAGES
REDUCE
TRAFFIC
RUNNING
WINDOWS
LOCALLY
REDUCES
NETWORK
TRAFFIC
DUE
TO
THE
LOCAL
ACCESS
OF
MAIN
WINDOWS
FILES
NETWORK
INDEPENDENCE
IF
THE
NETWORK
FAILS
AND
THEY
ALL
DO
AT
ONE
POINT
OR
ANOTHER
THE
LOCAL
INSTALLATION
WOULD
ALLOW
USERS
TO
KEEP
PRODUCING
AND
REDUCE
THE
COST
OF
DOWNTIME
FASTER
WINDOWS
THEORETICALLY
WINDOWS
WILL
RUN
FASTER
FROM
A
LOCAL
HARD
DRIVE
THAN
OVER
A
NETWORK
THIS
MAY
BE
A
HARD
POINT
TO
PROVE
IF
THE
NETWORK
HAS
AN
OPTICAL
BACKBONE
ANDOR
THE
NETWORK
DRIVES
ARE
SIGNIFICANTLY
FASTER
ACCESS
THAN
LOCAL
ONES
A
USER
TRAVELING
FROM
MACHINE
TO
MACHINE
DOES
NOT
NEED
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
VARYING
SETUPS
MONOCHROME
COLOR
TYPES
OF
MOUSE
ETC
SINCE
THE
WINDOWS
INSTALLATION
IS
ASSIGNED
TO
THE
WORKSTATION
DISADVANTAGES
COST
INSTALLING
WINDOWS
LOCALLY
REQUIRES
A
SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT
OF
DISK
SPACE
WORKSTATIONS
NOW
MUST
BE
PURCHASED
WITH
A
HARD
DISK
THAT
CAN
INCREASE
THE
COST
OF
THE
WORKSTATION
FROM
TO
PERCENT
ADMINISTRATION
LOCAL
WINDOWS
INSTALLATIONS
ARE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
ADMINISTER
NEW
DRIVERS
FOR
PERIPHERALS
ARE
CONSTANTLY
BEING
MADE
AVAILABLE
EACH
OF
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BE
INDIVIDUALLY
INSTALLED
ON
EACH
WORKSTATION
SECURITY
USERS
NOW
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
ERASE
OR
CORRUPT
THEIR
OWN
SYSTEM
FILES
FROM
SIMPLE
IGNORANCE
THIS
COULD
RESULT
IN
QUITE
A
HEADACHE
FOR
ADMINISTRATORS
WHO
MAY
HAVE
TO
CONSTANTLY
REPAIR
DAMAGED
INSTALLATIONS
BACKUP
WE
ALL
KNOW
THE
PROBLEMS
BACKING
UP
LOCAL
HARD
DISKS
THE
BACKUP
SETS
IF
DONE
VIA
A
CENTRALIZED
TAPE
SYSTEM
GET
VERY
LARGE
VERY
QUICKLY
BACKUP
INDIVIDUALLY
TO
FLOPPY
MAY
NOT
HAPPEN
AT
ALL
THIS
MAY
BE
ELIMINATED
IF
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
LOCAL
HARD
DISKS
ONLY
CONTAIN
REPLACEABLE
APPLICATIONS
AND
NOT
USER
DATA
THE
SHARED
WINDOWS
INSTALLATION
WINDOWS
IS
FULLY
INSTALLED
TO
A
NETWORK
DISK
VIA
THE
SETUPA
PROCEDURE
DESCRIBED
ABOVE
USERS
OR
ADMINISTRATORS
THEN
INSTALL
A
MINIMAL
SET
OF
FILES
TO
INDIVIDUAL
USER
DIRECTORIES
THESE
DIRECTORIES
MAY
BE
ON
A
LOCAL
HARD
DISK
OR
PERHAPS
A
NETWORK
HOME
DIRECTORY
THE
BULK
OF
THE
WINDOWS
SYSTEM
FILES
ARE
MAINTAINED
ON
THE
NETWORK
IN
A
SINGLE
DIRECTORY
SOME
FILES
AND
ARE
ACCESSED
SHARED
ASNEEDED
BY
USERS
THROUGHOUT
THEIR
WINDOWS
SESSION
THE
USERS
FILES
CONSIST
OF
A
SMALL
SET
OF
FILES
THAT
THE
USER
HAS
UPDATED
DURING
HISHER
WINDOWS
SESSION
THESE
INCLUDE
GROUP
FILES
INI
FILES
AND
OTHER
REGULARLY
UPDATED
FILES
ADVANTAGES
A
SINGLE
LOCATION
FOR
ALL
FILES
MAKES
UPDATES
TO
DRIVES
EASY
AS
AN
UPDATED
DRIVER
BECOMES
AVAILABLE
IT
ONLY
NEEDS
TO
BE
INSTALLED
IN
THIS
SINGLE
DIRECTORY
FOR
ALL
USERS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
IT
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
USERS
FILES
ARE
MAINTAINED
IN
NETWORK
HOME
DIRECTORIES
THE
ADMINISTRATOR
CAN
EASILY
EDIT
ANY
INI
FILE
ASNEEDED
TO
CORRECT
PROBLEMS
THAT
MAY
ARISE
THIS
INCLUDES
WININI
AND
SYSTEMINI
BACKUP
OF
ALL
PERTINENT
FILES
IS
DONE
EASILY
EVEN
IF
THE
USERS
FILES
ARE
ON
A
LOCAL
HARD
DISK
THE
BULK
OF
THE
WINDOWS
SYSTEM
IS
BACKED
UP
WITH
ALL
DRIVER
UPDATES
DISADVANTAGES
NETWORK
TRAFFIC
SINCE
ALL
WINDOWS
FILES
ARE
BEING
SHARED
IN
A
NETWORK
DIRECTORY
TRAFFIC
ON
THE
NETWORK
CAN
BECOME
A
PROBLEM
AN
EFFECT
THE
SPEED
OF
WINDOWS
IF
THE
NETWORK
CRASHES
ALL
PRODUCTION
COMES
TO
A
STOP
SINCE
WINDOWS
IS
RELIANT
UPON
THE
NETWORK
FOR
ITS
FILES
LOSS
OF
DATA
USUALLY
OCCURS
AS
WELL
SINCE
USERS
WORKING
IN
WINDOWS
AT
THE
TIME
OF
THE
CRASH
WILL
USUALLY
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
SAVE
THEIR
WORK
ALTHOUGH
MINIMAL
DISK
SPACE
IS
STILL
A
CONSIDERATION
IF
THE
USERS
FILES
ARE
MAINTAINED
ON
THE
NETWORK
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
USERS
CAN
CAUSE
A
SIGNIFICANT
UTILIZATION
OF
DISK
SPACE
DUE
TO
THEIR
PERSONAL
WINDOWS
FILES
ALONE
USERS
CANNOT
EASILY
MOVE
FROM
MACHINE
TO
MACHINE
UNLESS
THE
WORKSTATION
HARDWARE
ARE
SIMILAR
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
THE
WINDOWS
INSTALLATION
BEING
TIED
TO
A
PARTICULAR
USERNAME
IN
THE
CASE
OF
NETWORK
USER
FILES
THE
DISCUSSION
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
FROM
OTHER
ADMINISTRATORS
WITH
A
LARGE
WINDOWS
USERBASE
HOW
THEY
PREFER
SETTING
UP
WINDOWS
PERSONALLY
I
HAVE
SETUP
NUMEROUS
INSTALLATIONS
USING
THE
SHARED
SETUP
ALL
WINDOWS
AND
APPLICATION
FILES
ARE
ON
THE
NETWORK
WITH
LITTLE
OR
NO
UTILIZATION
OF
LOCAL
HARD
DISKS
IN
FACT
I
SOLD
A
NETWORK
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
COMPANY
WOULD
NO
LONGER
NEED
TO
PURCHASE
HARD
DISKS
FOR
THEIR
WORKSTATIONS
AND
THUS
SAVE
THAT
MUCH
MORE
MONEY
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
SEE
RECOMMENDATIONS
FOR
APPLICATIONS
SHOULD
APPS
SUCH
AS
WORD
ANDOR
EXCEL
BE
INSTALLED
LOCALLY
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
WINDOWS
IS
INSTALLED
AGAIN
I
KEEP
ALL
FILES
ON
THE
NETWORK
FOR
EASY
BACKUP
AND
ADMINISTRATION
BUT
THIS
IS
PUTTING
ALL
EGGS
IN
ONE
BASKET
IF
THE
NETWORK
CRASHES
WORK
COMES
TO
A
HALT
NOW
I
AM
SURE
MICROSOFT
AND
I
KNOW
YOUR
OUT
THERE
HAS
THEIR
OWN
IDEAS
ABOUT
THIS
AND
THEIR
INSIGHTS
WOULD
BE
OF
GREAT
VALUE
BUT
I
HOPE
TO
HEAR
FROM
PEOPLE
WITH
ACTUAL
WORKING
EXPERIENCE
WITH
USERS
AND
NETWORK
ADMINISTRATION
