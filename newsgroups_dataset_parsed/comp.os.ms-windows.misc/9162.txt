ive
just
bought
a
pc
which
came
with
a
bundle
of
lotus
stuff
including
adobe
type
manager
version
as
a
newcomer
to
windows
im
confused
about
which
i
should
be
using
atm
or
truetype
there
is
a
program
called
trueeffects
for
windows
that
allows
you
to
define
attributes
for
truetype
fonts
and
have
them
look
like
new
fonts
it
will
give
your
font
different
backgrounds
or
shadows
or
reverse
etc
it
only
works
with
tt
fonts
yes
and
the
idea
was
ripped
off
from
adobe
which
has
had
a
program
called
typealign
for
a
few
years
now
typealign
does
the
same
thing
for
adobe
type
fonts
and
adobe
has
said
that
the
next
version
will
work
with
both
adobe
type
and
truetype
and
typealign
does
some
things
that
trueeffects
does
not
including
some
things
you
apparently
want
if
you
want
to
use
it
you
best
not
want
to
use
it
with
an
atm
type
font
oh
yeah
lest
you
think
this
is
a
really
cool
program
none
of
the
effects
are
scalable
like
the
brick
background
pattern
is
the
same
size
whether
your
font
is
point
of
point
and
it
is
not
extensible
ie
you
can
not
add
pattern
of
your
own
and
you
cant
rorate
the
background
pattern
and
you
cant
make
the
pattern
extend
beyond
one
character
every
character
in
that
new
font
has
the
entire
pattern
in
it
as
opposed
to
having
the
same
pattern
run
contiguously
through
a
couple
of
characters
it
is
however
cheap
maybe
i
will
buy
a
copy
when
the
next
version
comes
out
if
they
fix
some
of
these
gripes
