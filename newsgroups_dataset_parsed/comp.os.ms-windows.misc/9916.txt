i
installed
windows
for
workgroups
on
my
network
and
im
having
problems
mapping
drives
in
the
filemanager
situation
if
i
put
lastdrive
z
in
my
configsys
netx
will
run
but
i
cant
access
drive
f
to
log
in
to
novell
if
i
dont
put
lastdrive
z
in
my
configsys
i
cant
access
other
drives
from
the
filemanager
it
seems
that
there
should
be
a
way
to
make
netx
work
with
the
lastdrive
statement
in
my
configsys
i
would
appreciate
any
help
its
probably
an
easy
problem
that
all
you
windows
gurus
solved
many
many
moons
ago
