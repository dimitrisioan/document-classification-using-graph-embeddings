IN
MY
OBJECT
DIALOG
BOX

PLAY
WITH

FOR
A
WHILE
AT
ONE
POINT
HAVING
TWO
ENTRIES
TO
SEE
IF

THOTHER
DONT
AND
FINALLY
I
GET
IT

THE
ONLY
THING
I
CAN
SEE
THATS
DIFFERENT
NOW
IS
THAT
ITS
NOW
THE
FIRST
ITEM
ON
THE
LIST
AND
IT
USED
TO
BE
THE
LAST
BUT
NOW
I
END
UP
WITH
THREE
EQUATION
ENTRIED
AND
ALL
OF
THEM
WORKING
