truetype

files
are

larger

their
equivalents
if
you
are
using
a

compressor
though
be
aware
that
truetype
fonts
will
compress
whereas
fonts
will
not
they
are
encrypted
this
isnt
entirely
true
it
is
true
that
truetype
fonts
are
larger
than
their
atm
counterparts
but
atm

do
get

although
the

files
are
small
they
compress
quite
largely
and
as
you
can
see
even
the
regular
pfb
files
have
some

you
still

even
if

may
