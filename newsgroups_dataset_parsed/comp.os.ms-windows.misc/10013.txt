problem

enter
to
shrink
the
box
or
use

to
close

to

windows
i
get
a
couple
of
screens
about

not
responding
i
think
things
are
still
alive
under
the
black
screen
because
if
i
alttab
to
cycle
through
the
running
apps
i
get
flashes
of
text
but
then
the
black
returns
this
persists
even
if
the
machine
is
powered
on
and
off

using
borlands
application
frameworks
and
