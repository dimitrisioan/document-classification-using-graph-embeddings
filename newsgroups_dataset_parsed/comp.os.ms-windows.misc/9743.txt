AND
A
BAD
MEMORY
HI
MY
LAST
QUESTION
FOR
THE
YEAR
I
HAVE
A
MAILORDER
NONAME
NOTEBOOK
WITH
MEG
RAM
I
NEVER
HAVE
PROBLEMS
WITH
MY
HUGE
RAMDISK
OR
WHEN
RUNNING
DESQVIEW
BUT
AND
CONSTANTLY
CRASH
ON
ME
MOST
COMMONLY
CITING
A
MEMORY
PARITY
ERROR
THE
ONLY
THING
I
CAN
DO
IS
TURN
OFF
AND
REBOOT
MY
CMOS
TICKS
OFF
COUNTS
ALL
THE
MEMORY
EVERY
STARTUP
AND
THERE
IS
NEVER
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
EITHER
COULD
IT
BE
A
BUG
IN
MY
WINDOWS
COPY
INSTEAD
OF
THE
HARDWARE
I
REMEMBER
HAVING
SOME
DISK
ERROR
PROBLEMS
WHEN
INSTALLING
IT
IS
THERE
ANY
CHANGE
I
COULD
MAKE
TO
LESSEN
THE
FREQUENCY
OR
LIKELYHOOD
OF
THIS
HAPPENING
I
THINK
WIN
VS
WIN
S
PRODUCE
DIFFERENT
CRASHES
BUT
BOTH
CRASH
FREQUENTLY
NONETHELESS
I
KNOW
THIS
IS
A
PAIN
BUT
PLEASE

WILL
STOP
ASKING
