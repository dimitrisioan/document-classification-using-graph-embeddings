i
am
having
a
problem
configuring
the
mouse
in
windows
to
use
with
i
dont
believe
is
the
problem
i
tried
a
mouse
on
the
usual
place
and
it
still
did
not
like
it
simply
windows
seems
to
only
support
mice
on
or
the
funny
part
is
though
that
microsofts
own
mouse
driver
was
quite
happy
with
my
mouse
sitting
on
why
cant
windows
use
the
mouse
driver
or
at
least
support
ive
tried
this
too
actually
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
use
my
second
modem
from
windows
it
still
will
not
talk
to
that
modem
i
created
two
profiles
amstrad
for
my
amstrad
modem
on
and
maestro
for
my
maestro
on
it
will
not
talk
to
the
maestro
at
all
that
their
driver
does
not
support
and
in
windows
their
suggestion
was
that
the
microsoft
or
setting
in
windows
setup
would
work
it
does
not
nor
here
windows
i
can
not
believe
that
it
is
not
possible
at
worst
you
would
need
a
special
version
of
a
mouse
driver
that
looked
at
and
instead
of
and
i
know
that
and
are
normally
printer
port
irqs
but
i
ive
seen
nothing
like
that
ive
experimented
with
logitechs
mouse
driver
too
with
no
sucess
have
no
printers
attached
a
side
note
is
that
i
would
really
like
to
assign
to
some
higher
irq
because
my
soundblaster
board
uses
right
now
im
not
using
but
no
modem
that
i
know
of
allows
settings
other
than
irqs
and
if
you
have
a
soundblaster
pro
it
should
support
as
well
finally
a
board
that
supports
irqs
the
only
one
i
have
except
my
