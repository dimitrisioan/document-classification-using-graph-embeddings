hello
who
can
tell
me
where
can
i
find
the
pd
or
shareware
which
can
capture
windows
output
of
printer
mananger
if
you
are
planning
on
using
this
on
a
regular
basis
conncting
the
printer
to
file
can
become
bothersome
because
windows
then
asks
you
for
the
filename
that
you
want
to
create
ive
found
that
putting
a
line
in
systemini
in
the
ports
section
with
just
a
path
and
filename
works
the
only
problem
is
that
if
you
send
more
than
one
job
the
second
one
deletes
the
first
