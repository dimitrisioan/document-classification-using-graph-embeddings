serial
printing
hi
weve
been
having
problems
on
a
few
setups
when
printing
to
a
serial
printer
dmp
or
laser
i
have
used
works
and
windows
write
the
output
is
ok
from
dos
and
if
i
send
plain
text
output
but
anything
fancy
garbles
or
just
doesnt
output
the
exception
is
outputting
to
a
lserjet
which
appears
to
be
fast
enough
receiving
data
not
to
bother
about
handshaking
messages
im
sure
im
not
alone
in
this
ive
tried
most
of
the
printnetwork
manager
options
i
can
think
of
anyone
had
similar
problems
theyve
cured
and
would
like
to
tell
me
bout
it
thanks
