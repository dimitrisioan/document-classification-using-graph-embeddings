SERIAL
PRINTING
HI
WEVE
BEEN
HAVING
PROBLEMS
ON
A
FEW
SETUPS
WHEN
PRINTING
TO
A
SERIAL
PRINTER
DMP
OR
LASER
I
HAVE
USED
WORKS
AND
WINDOWS
WRITE
THE
OUTPUT
IS
OK
FROM
DOS
AND
IF
I
SEND
PLAIN
TEXT
OUTPUT
BUT
ANYTHING
FANCY
GARBLES
OR
JUST
DOESNT
OUTPUT
THE
EXCEPTION
IS
OUTPUTTING
TO
A
LSERJET
WHICH
APPEARS
TO
BE
FAST
ENOUGH
RECEIVING
DATA
NOT
TO
BOTHER
ABOUT
HANDSHAKING
MESSAGES
IM
SURE
IM
NOT
ALONE
IN
THIS
IVE
TRIED
MOST
OF
THE
PRINTNETWORK
MANAGER
OPTIONS
I
CAN
THINK
OF
ANYONE
HAD
SIMILAR
PROBLEMS
THEYVE
CURED
AND
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TELL
ME
BOUT
IT
THANKS
JOHN
ATHERTON
