i
just
installed
a
new
truetype
font
under
mswindows
but
though
all
the
applications
display
the
font
correctly
on
the
screen
quite
a
few
of
them
fail
to
print
out
the
document
correctly
on
a
laserjet
nonpostscript
printer
but
when
i
use
the
windows
accessory
write
the
printer
prints
square
boxes
in
place
of
the
characters
of
the
new
font
yet
write
does
display
the
font
correctly
on
the
screen
this
is
a
common
problem
with
highly
complex
truetype
fonts
microsoft
admits
to
a
problem
with
older
versions
of
the
postscript
printer
driver
but
ive
found
it
to
be
pretty
generic
you
can
get
around
the
problem
by
adjusting
the
parameter
outlinethreshold
in
the
truetype
section
of
winini
this
entry
specifies
the
number
of
pelsperem
at
which
windows
will
render
truetype
fonts
as
outline
fonts
instead
of
as
bitmap
fonts
the
default
is
ive
generally
been
able
to
get
fonts
to
work
by
setting
depending
on
your
printer
resolution
and
the
point
size
you
are
using
you
may
need
a
different
value
the
windows
resource
kit
warns
against
going
above
presumably
that
might
cause
fonts
to
print
as
square
boxes
or
something
