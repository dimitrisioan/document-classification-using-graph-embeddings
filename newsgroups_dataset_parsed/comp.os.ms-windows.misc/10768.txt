RE
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
DOS
EXTERNAL
JOIN
COMMAND
IN
ARTICLE
THE
AUTHOR
WRITES
I
AM
SETTING
UP
MY
DOSUNIX
BOX
ON
A
IDE
AND
A
SCSI
DRIVE
AND
WAS
WONDERING
ABOUT
THE
USE
OF
THE
MSDOS
JOIN
COMMAND
I
LIKE
THE
WAY
IT
SETS
THINGS
UP
SINCE
I
WONT
HAVE
TO
STICK
WITH
THE
C
D
E
CRAP
THAT
DOS
ENFORCES
I
LIKE
HOW
IT
WOULD
MIMIC
MOUNT
POINTS
OF
UNIX
FILESYSTEMS
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THERE
WERE
PROBLEMS
WITH
USING
IT
OR
AT
LEAST
UNDER
OLDER
VERSIONS
OF
DOS
PLEASE
TELL
I
HAVE
BEEN
USING
THE
JOIN
COMMAND
FOR
MANY
YEARS
NOW
MOSTLY
WITH
GOOD
SUCCESS
IN
DUPLICATING
UNIXSTYLE
FILE
MOUNTS
YOU
WILL
HEAR
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
CURSING
JOIN
BECAUSE
THEY
CONFUSE
IT
WITH
THE
DOS
APPEND
COMMAND
A
TRUELY
GNARLY
HACK
BUT
DONT
BELIEVE
THEM
YOU
ALSO
WILL
HEAR
PEOPLE
SAYING
THAT
MICROSOFT
RECOMMENDS
THAT
YOU
NOT
USE
JOIN
BUT
IN
MICROSOFTS
WINDOWS
WORKGROUPS
RESOURCE
TOOLKIT
THE
FOLLOWING
APPEARS
JOIN
AN
MSDOS
UTILITY
WORKS
FINE
WITH
WINDOWS
FOR
WORKGROUPS
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
CHANGE
THE
STATE
OF
THE
JOINED
DRIVES
DURING
A
WINDOWS
FOR
WORKGROUPS
SESSION
THIS
INCLUDES
ADDING
OR
REMOVING
JOINED
DRIVES
FROM
WITHIN
WINDOWS
FOR
WORKGROUPS
WE
RECOMMEND
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
USE
JOIN
WHEN
RUNNING
WINDOWS
SETUP
OR
WINDOWS
FOR
WORKGROUPS
WITHIN
THIS
CAVEAT
JOIN
APPEARS
TO
BE
VALID
UNDER
WINDOWS
HOWEVER
I
HAVE
FOUND
A
COUPLE
OF
APPLICATIONS
THAT
DONT
DEAL
WELL
WITH
FILESYSTEMS
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
MOUNTED
USING
JOIN
IN
PARTICULAR
THE
WORST
OFFENDER
IS
WORD
FOR
WINDOWS
IT
GETS
VERY
CONFUSED
WHEN
YOU
EDIT
AND
THEN
TRY
TO
SAVE
A
FILE
ON
A
JOINED
DRIVE
IT
WANTS
TO
CREATE
THE
SAVED
FILE
AS
NNNNNTMP
IN
THE
CURRENT
DIR
THEN
DELETE
THE
OLD
FILE
AND
RENAME
THE
NNNNNTMP
FILE
TO
THE
DOC
FILE
UNFORTUNATELY
WFW
USUALLY
WRITES
THE
NNNNNTMP
FILE
IN
SOME
IDIOTIC
PLACE
OTHER
THAN
THE
CURRENT
DIRECTORY
OFTEN
IN
THE
ROOT
DIR
OF
THE
JOINED
FILESYSTEM
BUT
NOT
ALWAYS
THEN
AFTER
DELETING
THE
ORIGINAL
DOC
FILE
IT
CANT
FIND
THE
NNNNNTMP
FILE
TO
RENAME
IT
UNLESS
YOU
SEARCH
YOUR
DISK
SYSTEMS
THE
DOCUMENT
IS
GONE
I
HAVE
ALSO
FOUND
SUBTLE
PROBLEMS
USING
THE
MKS
TOOLKIT
FROM
A
DOS
BOX
WHEN
JOINED
FILESYSTEMS
ARE
PRESENT
I
USED
TO
JOIN
CTEMP
WITH
A
RAMDISK
BUT
MKS
SOMETIMES
GETS
CONFUSED
WHEN
DOING
AN
LS
ON
THE
CTEMP
DIR
AND
MISSES
SOME
FILES
IN
THE
TEMP
DIR
THIS
IS
DIFFICULT
TO
REPRODUCE
BUT
IT
GOES
AWAY
TOTALLY
WHEN
JOIN
IS
NOT
USED
I
THINK
THIS
IS
A
WINDOWS
PROBLEM
RATHER
THAN
MKSS
SINCE
IT
WORKS
OK
UNDER
RAW
DOS
SO
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
CAN
USE
JOIN
BUT
BE
AWARE
THAT
IT
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
ROBUST
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
WOULDNT
IT
BE
REAL
GREAT
TO
MOUNT
NETWORK
DRIVES
IE
Z
UNDER
THE
MAIN
FILE
TREE
RATHER
THAN
HAVING
ALL
THOSE
DARNED
DRIVE
LETTERS
UNFORTUNATELY
JOIN
WONT
LET
YOU
DO
IT
THERE
WAS
TALK
ON
THE
NET
ABOUT
A
SIMPLE
PATCH
TO
LET
JOIN
WORK
ON
NETWORK
DRIVES
BUT
I
DONT
REMEMBER
THE
SOURCE
ITS
TOO
BAD
THE
JOIN
COMMAND
IS
NOT
BETTER
IMPLEMENTED
SINCE
IT
WOULD
AVOID
USING
ALL
THOSE
STUPID
DRIVE
LETTERS
I
REALIZE
THAT
MESSDOS
WAS
MEANT
FOR
CASUAL
EVEN
IGNORANT
USERS
SO
MOUNTING
ALL
THE
DRIVES
IN
ONE
FILE
TREE
MIGHT
BE
CONFUSING
BUT
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
MS
IS
GOING
TO
CARRY
THIS
OVER
INTO
WINDOWS
NT
ANOTHER
OS
MEANT
FOR
CASUAL
EVEN
IGORANT
USERS
NOT
WITH
ALL
ITS
OLD
FAMILY
SYSTEM
BAGGAGE
MAYBE
MS
NEEDS
A
RECOVERY
GROUP
SO
THEY
CAN
GET
ON

LIFE
