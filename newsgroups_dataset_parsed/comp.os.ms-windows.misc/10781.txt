ZHAO
WRITES
CURRENTLY
WE
ARE
USING
WINFAX
SOFTWARE
TO
RECEIVESEND
FAX
ON
OUR
PCS
IT
WORKS
PRETTY
WELL
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ALL
RECEIVED
FILES
ARE
IN
BIT
MAP
FORMAT
WHICH
TAKE
LOTS
OF
HD
SPACE
I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
THERE
IS
SOME
PROGRAMS
THAT
CAN
DO
PATTERN
RECOGNITION
OF
THE
RASTER
CHARACTERS
IN
FAXIN
FILES
AND
TRANSLATE
THEM
INTO
ASCII
CODE
THEN
STORE
THE
FILE
IN
ASCII
FORMAT
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
TELL
ME
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THERE
IS
SUCH
SOFTWARE
PACKAGE
TO
DO
SUCH
TRANSLATION
IF
THERE
IS
ONE
WHERE
CAN
I
FIND
IT
IS
ANY
SUCH
SOFTWARE
PACKAGE
ON
PUBLIC
DOMAIN
WHAT
VERSION
OF
WINFAX
DO
YOU
HAVE
THE
NEWEST
VERSION
HAS
AN
OCR
OPTICAL
CHARACTER
RECOGNITION
BUILT
IN
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
IS
THAT
IT
CAN
TAKE
A
FAX
IE
A
LETTER
AND
CONVERT
IT
INTO
ASCII
SO
THAT
ONE
CAN
EDIT
THE
DOCUMENT
WO
RETYPING
IT
HOWEVER
I
FOUND
THAT
THE
OCR
THAT
COMES
PACKAGED
WITH
WINFAX
DOES
NOT
WORK
AS
WELL
AS
OMNIPAGE
PROFESSIONAL
ALSO
BY
DELRINA
SOFTWARE
SO
ONCE
AGAIN
WINFAX
VER
HAS
WHAT
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
GOOD
LUCK
REGARDS
