past
is
technically
superior
to
windows
considering
that
ms
makes
more
money
per
copy
of
sold
than
ibm
and
we
cowrote
most
of
it
differences
between
and
had
about
half
the
memory
requirements
was
quicker
even
at
half
the
memory
was
much
more
stable
oh
and
one
more
thing
ibm
did
by
themselves
yes
a
lot
of
what
has
in
common
with
was
written
by
you
guys
however
many
of
the
things
that
made
so
much
more
successful
workplace
shell
than
previous
versions
were
ibm
work
so
we
cowrote
it
may
be
technically
accurate
but
its
really
a
red
herring
as
the
bits
that
are
selling
the
product
werent
written
by
you
dont
forget
seamless
win
apps
on
ms
couldnt
do
it
viz
wlo
but
ibm
managed
to
do
it
right
