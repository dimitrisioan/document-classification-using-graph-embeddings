CHICOGO
IS
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
USE
IT
IS
LIKE
NT
A
TRUE
OS
WITH
THRUE
MULTITASKING
AND
MULTITHREADING
BUT
HAS
MUCH
SMALLER
HARDWARE
REQUIREMENTS
AND
DOES
NOT
MEET
DOD
SECURITY
SPECS
BUT
THATS
OKAY
SINCE
IT
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
MORE
OF
A
CLIENT
OS
THERE
ARE
A
FEW
OTEHR
DIFFERENCES
BUT
THOSE
ARE
THE
MAIN
ONES
THERE
WAS
AN
ARTICLE
ABOUT
CHICOGO
IN
PC
WEEK
LAST
AUGUST
THE
CHICOGO
AND
NT
DEVELOPMENT
GROUPS
AT
MICROOFT
ARE
IN
INTENSE
COMPETITION
SO
IT
IS
SAID
HOWEVER
I
THINK
A
DIFFERENT
RELATIONSHIP
WILL
ARISE
NT
WILL
BE
THE
SERVER
NETOWRK
TECHONOLOGY
CHICOGO
WILL
BE
THE
CLIENT
MACHINE
IT
IS
ENTIRELY
POSSIBLE
FOR
DIFFERENT
OSS
TO
WORK
TOGETHER
PARTLY
BECAUSE
CHICOGO
IS
JUST
A
SMALL
NT
THINK
OF
IT
THAT
WAY
ANYWAY
NOVELL
NETWARE
CREATES
AN
OS
ON
THE
SERVER
THAT
IS
TRULY
NOT
DOS
SO
DONT
SCORN
THE
CONCEPT
ANYWAY
DONT
EXPECT
IT
SOON
WINDOWS
AND
DOS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
RELEASED
NEXT
YEAR
READ
SEE
IT
IN
SO
I
EXPECT
THAT
CHICOGO
WONT
BE
OUT
TIL
HOW
DOES
CHICAGO
DIFFER
FROM
THE
SORT
OF
ANNOUNCED
WINDOWS
MY
UNDERSTAND
ING
AT
LEAST
FROM
THE
INBFOWORLD
ACCOUND
OF
WINDOWS
IS
THAT
ITS
SORT
OF
NT
LITEA
FULLFLEDGED
OPERATING
SYSTEM
BUT
LACKING
SERVER
AND
SECURITY
FEATURES
THAT
MAKE
NT
SUCH
A
BEAR
IS
NOT
TRUE
MULTITHREADING
CAN
ANYONE
TELL
ME
HOW
CHICAGOWINDOWS
WOULD
DIFFER
FROM
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
IM
NOT
TRYING
TO
START
A
FLAME
WAR
HERE
IM
SIMPLY
CURIOUS
IF
THERE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
ANY
FEATURE
ADVANTAGE
IN
EITHER
OF
THESE
PRODUCTS
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
HAS
UNCLE
BILLS
SEAL
OF
APPROVAL
MUCH
OF
A
FEATURE
