you

your
finances

believe

there
are

some
things
listed
above
that

has
but
im
almost
sure
that
quicken
doesnt
do
everything
ive
listed
if
im
wrong
im
sure
hordes
of
quicken
devotees
will
flame
me
to
a
crisp
one
thing
that
quicken
has
that
managing
your
money
does
not
yet
have
is
a
windows
version
meca
software
is
rumored
to
be
working
on
a
windows
version
of
managing
your
money
for
release
late
this
year
i
hope
this
information
is
of
use
to
you
ive
found
managing
your
money
to
be
a
very
usefull
program
for
keeping
my
financial
records
on
the
other
hand
i
know
many
people
who
are
equally
as
happy
with
quicken
if
quicken
has
all
the
features
you
need
or
want
id
go
with
it
if
you
find
any
of
the
managing
your
money
features
that
quicken
doesnt
have
to
be
useful
i
think
its
well
worth
the
price
