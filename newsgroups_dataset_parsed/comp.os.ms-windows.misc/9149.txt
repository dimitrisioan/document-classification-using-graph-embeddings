ive
just
bought
a
pc
which
came
with
a
bundle
of
lotus
stuff
including
adobe
type
manager
version
as
a
newcomer
to
windows
im
confused
about
which
i
should
be
using
atm
or
truetype
if
you
are
going
to
stay
with
atm
be
sure
to
upgrade
to
which
replaces
who
knows
how
old
is
is
as
fast
as
tt
and
if
you
disable
the
small
screen
fonts
atm
does
better
screen
rendering
at
the
smaller
point
sizes
not
true
both
type
and
tt
fonts
can
be
of
excellent
quality
and
poor
quality
at
any
size
it
all
depends
on
the
fonts
maker
and
the
complexity
of
the
glyphs
related
to
the
size
and
resolution
at
which
they
are
viewed
probably
the
reason
for
your
opinionexperience
that
tt
is
inferior
is
because
most
tt
fonts
on
the
market
today
have
been
converted
from
type
outlines
to
tt
either
by
the
font
vendor
or
endusers
using
fontographer
or
fontmonger
instead
of
the
tt
fonts
being
handhinted
to
take
advantage
of
the
tt
hinting
language
at
best
these
converted
tt
fonts
will
be
on
a
par
with
the
type
font
of
its
orgin
truetype
is
a
much
richer
and
more
robust
hinting
language
than
type
the
hinting
of
diagonals
for
instance
which
tt
does
and
type
cannot
if
you
check
out
the
windows
core
fonts
times
arial
courier
symbol
wingdings
youll
see
what
can
be
done
with
tt
there
are
other
fonts
out
there
that
have
been
handhinted
and
not
just
converted
some
of
the
microsoft
tt
font
pack
fonts
are
hinted
very
well
you
can
use
both
tt
and
atm
fonts
at
the
same
time
if
you
like
atm
type
fonts
tend
to
be
of
higher
quality
and
be
more
complete
in
terms
of
foreign
characters
again
not
true
the
characters
in
a
tt
or
type
font
depend
on
the
maker
if
someone
converts
a
type
font
to
tt
theyll
only
get
the
characters
in
the
font
of
orgin
tt
allows
for
much
more
flexibility
in
this
area
as
well
you
can
have
thousands
of
glyphs
in
a
tt
font
file
macpswindowsunicode
char
set
and
use
the
characters
appropriate
for
the
particular
platform
you
are
running
the
font
on
for
instance
all
or
our
fontpack
tt
fonts
have
the
macwindows
char
set
in
them
the
metrics
of
the
fonts
are
such
that
if
the
font
is
brought
over
to
the
mac
the
user
will
have
access
to
the
full
mac
char
set
