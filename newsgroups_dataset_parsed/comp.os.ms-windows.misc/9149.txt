CONFUSED
ABOUT
WHICH
I
SHOULD

IF
YOU
ARE
GOING

BE
SURE
TO
UPGRADE

SIZES
NOT
TRUE
BOTH
TYPE

FONTS
CAN
BE
OF
EXCELLENT
QUALITY
AND
POOR
QUALITY
AT
ANY
SIZE
IT
ALL
DEPENDS
ON
THE
FONTS
MAKER
AND
THE
COMPLEXITY
OF
THE
GLYPHS
RELATED
TO
THE
SIZE
AND
RESOLUTION
AT
WHICH
THEY
ARE
VIEWED
PROBABLY
THE
REASON
FOR
YOUR
OPINIONEXPERIENCE
THAT
TT
IS
INFERIOR
IS
BECAUSE
MOST
TT
FONTS
ON
THE

TODAY
HAVE
BEEN
CONVERTED
FROM
TYPE
OUTLINES
TO
TT
EITHER
BY
THE
FONT
VENDOR
OR
ENDUSERS
USING
FONTOGRAPHER
OR
FONTMONGER
INSTEAD
OF
THE
TT
FONTS
BEING
HANDHINTED
TO
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE

HINTING

AT

THESE
CONVERTED

A
MUCH
