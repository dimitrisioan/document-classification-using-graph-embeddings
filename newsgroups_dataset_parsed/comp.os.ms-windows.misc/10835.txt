LOGIC
OF
BACKUP
I
HAVE
BEEN
BACKING
UP
MY
HARD
DRIVE
EVER
SINCE
I
HAD
TO
REINSTALL
EVERYTHING
FROM
SCRATCH
AFTER
A
CRASH
LEARNED
THE
HARD
WAY
DIDNT
I
I
AM
USING
A
WINDOWSBASED
BACKUP
PROGRAM
ACTUALLY
NORTON
AND
I
BEGAN
WONDERING
ABOUT
THE
LOGIC
OF
THIS
SURE
IF
I
ACCIDENTALLY
DELETE
A
FILE
I
CAN
GET
IT
FROM
THE
ARCHIVE
BUT
WHAT
IF
MY
DISK
CRASHES
AGAIN
I
WOULD
NOT
BE
ABLE
TO
START
WINDOWS
TO
RUN
THE
BACKUP
PROGRAM
NOTE
BY
CRASH
I
MEAN
THERE
WAS
SOME
ERROR
MESSAGE
THAT
PREVENTED
THE
MACHINE
FROM
BOOTING
PROPERLY
I
THINK
I
GAVE
UP
TOO
EARLY
BUT
I
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
TIMEPATIENCETOOLS
TO
FIGURE
OUT
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
MY
HARD
DRIVE
NEEDED
CLEANING
UP
ANYWAY
YEAH
RIGHT
THIS
WHOLE
SCENARIO
IS
COMPLICATED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
I
AM
USING
STACKER
SO
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
POSSIBILITIES
IM
RIGHT
IF
MY
DISK
REALLY
CRASHES
I
WOULD
AT
LEAST
HAVE
TO
REINSTALL
DOS
AND
WINDOWS
TO
GET
THE
BACKUP
PROGRAM
WORKING
IM
WRONG
THERE
IS
AN
EASY
WAY
TO
MAKE
A
MIRROR
OF
A
HARD
DISK
THAT
CAN
EASILY
RESTORE
ITS
STATE
FROM
SCRATCH
THE
POLLS
ARE
OPEN
