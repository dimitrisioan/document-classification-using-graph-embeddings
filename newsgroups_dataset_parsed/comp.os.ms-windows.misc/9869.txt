previous
article
michael

says
whenever
i
start
file
manager
the
status
bar
is
not
displayed
even
though
it
is
selected
in
the
options
menu
if
i
deselect
it
then
select
it
again
the
bar
appears
anyone
have
any
ideas
why
this
is
happening
no
not
really
it
may
be
that
your
winfileini
has
gotten
corrupted
for
some
unknown
reason
have
you
tried
recreating
it
by
either
filemanager
with
the
save
setting
option
on
when
the
status
bar
is
visible
or
clicking
on
the
control
menuthe
one
with
minimize
and
maximize
in
in
when
everything
looks
proper
if
you
have
and
it
still
doesnt
work
you
may
want
to
delete
your
winfileini
and
try
one
of
these
two
saving
procedures
again
to
totally
recreate
the
file
from
scratch
good
luck
