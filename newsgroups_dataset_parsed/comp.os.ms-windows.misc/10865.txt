WRITES
BY
NIGHT
IM
AN
AMIGA
USER
BY
DAY
I
WORK
WITH
WINDOWS
ID
BE
MUCH
MORE
COMFORTABLE
IN
WINDOWS
IF
I
HAD
TWO
THINGS
A
GOOD
PERSONAL
INFORMATION
MANAGER
YOU
KNOW
A
CALENDAR
ADDRESS
BOOK
REMINDER
LIST
ETC
ROLLED
INTO
ONE
CLEAN
INTERFACE
I
PREFER
INFOSELECT
MYSELF
BUT
IT
IS
A
STRANGE
KIND
OF
PIM
A
GOOD
FILE
MANAGER
MICROSOFTS
IS
VERY
POOR
BY
MY
STANDARDS
HOW
ABOUT
ONE
THAT
HAS
A
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
WINDOW
AND
ALLOWS
FILE
OPERATIONS
BETWEEN
THEM
BEING
ABLE
TO
LAUNCH
PROGRAMS
FROM
THE
SAME
INTERFACE
WOULD
BE
NICE
AS
WELL
AS
TEXT
READING
AND
GRAPHICS
VIEWING
THOSE
WHO
ARE
FAMILIAR
WITH
DIRECTORY
OPUS
ON
THE
AMIGA
KNOW
WHAT
IM
LOOKING
FOR
WELL
A
FEW
THINGS
MIGHT
HELP
YOU
LIKE
THE
FILE
MANAGER
BETTER
TO
GET
MORE
THAN
ONE
WINDOW
SIMPLY
DOUBLE
CLICK
ON
A
DRIVE
ICON
THAT
IT
ONLY
GIVES
YOU
ONE
WINDOW
TO
WORK
WITH
IS
A
FALLACY
YOU
CAN
DRAG
FILES
BETWEEN
WINDOWS
TO
ANY
ICON
ON
THE
TREE
ON
THE
LEFT
SIDE
OF
THE
WINDOW
AND
TO
ANY
DRIVE
ICON
THIS
BEATS
YOUR
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
WINDOW
AS
YOU
CAN
HAVE
AS
MANY
OPEN
AS
YOU
WISH
INSTEAD
OF
JUST
TWO
YOU
CAN
LAUNCH
ANY
APP
FROM
WITHIN
FILE
MANAGER
BY
DOUBLE
CLICKING
ON
THE
EXECUTABLES
ICON
YOU
CAN
LAUNCH
ANY
APPLICATION
AND
OPEN
A
DOCUMENT
FILE
BY
DOUBLE
CLICKING
ON
THE
DOCUMENT
FILES
ICON
PROVIDED
YOU
HAVE
ASSOCIATIONS
SET
CORRECTLY
THIS
IS
EASILY
DONE
WITH
THE
MENUS
THE
BROWSE
CAPABILITY

A
LOT
OF
FUNCTIONALITY

YOU
NAME
ALL
YOUR

THIS
TAKES
CARE
OF
YOUR
REQUIREMENT
FOR
TEXT
READING
AND
GRAPHICS
VIEWING
I
KNOW
SOMEONE
WHO
PREFERS
USING
FILE
MANAGER
AS
HIS
SHELL
SETTING
UP
ALL
THE
ASSOCIATIONS
YOU
NEED
IS
THE
WAY
TO
DO
IT
IF
DIRECTORY
OPUS
IS
HALF
AS
GOOD
AS
FILE
MANAGER
THEN
IT
MUST
BE
PRETTY
GOOD
INDEED
FILE
MANAGER
JUST
NEEDS
YOU
TO
UNDERSTAND
HOW
SOME
THINGS
ARE
DONE
