DEAR
FRIEND
THE
RISC
MEANS
REDUCED
INSTRUCTION
SET
COMPUTER
THE
RISC
USUALLY
HAS
SMALL
INSTRUCTION
SET
SO
AS
TO
REDUCE
THE
CIRCUIT
COMPLEX
AND
CAN
INCREASE
THE
CLOCK
RATE
TO
HAVE
A
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
YOU
CAN
READ
SOME
BOOKS
ABOUT
COMPUTER
ARCHITECTURE
FOR
MORE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
RISC
HMM
NOT
THAT
I
AM
AN
AUTHORITY
ON
RISC
BUT
I
CLEARLY
REMEMBER
READING
THAT
THE
INSTRUCTION
SET
ON
RISC
CPUS
IS
RATHER
LARGE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
IN
ADDRESSING
MODES
RISC
INSTRUCTION
SETS
ARE
NOT
AS
ORTHOGONAL
IS
CISC
THEORETICALLY
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
REDUCED
NOT
ANY
LONGER
THATS
WHY
EVERYONE
IS
ARGUING
ABOUT
RISC
VS
CISC
PERSONALLY
I
THINK
CISC
WILL
WIN
OUT
JUST
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
PENTIUM
NOT
THAT
I
LIKE
INTEL
ARCHITECTURES
EITHER
BUT
THATS
ANOTHER
STORY
BYE
DO
YOU
MEAN
THAT
THE
PENTIUM
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
RISC
OR
THAT
IT
WILL
OUTSELL
THEM
ALL
IF
THE
FIRST
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
INTEL
CISC
LIKE
THE
PENTIUM
ARE
A
ALWAYS
A
GENERATION
AWAY
FROM
THE
BEST
RISCS
ALSO
RISCS
CPU
ARE
MORE
COSTLY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
SOLD
IN
THE
SAME
QUANTITIES
NOT
EVEN
ON
THE
SAME
ORDER
BUT
I
REMEMBER
READING
ABOUT
YEARS
MAYBE
ABOUT
A
FROM
HYPERCUBE
THAT
DID
A
MIPS
WAS
SUPERSCALLAR
AND
REORDERED
ITS
INSTRUCTION
ITSELF
SO
IM
NOT
SURE
BUT
I
THINK
THE
WAS
A
TRANSPUTER
SO
YA
TIE
A
GAZILLION
OF
THEM
TOGETHER
TO
GET
THE
NEWEST
IS
THE
WHICH
KICKS
ANYONES
BUTT
HAVENT
SEEN
THEM
USED
MUCH
THOUGH
ANYWAY
TO
RESPOND
I
THINK
THE
PENTIUM
CISC
IS
BETTER
THAN
THE
MORE
ADVANCED
RISC
EG
LIKE
THE
ALPHA
ETC
THE
PENTIUM
HAS
APPROXIMATELY
THE
SAME
PERFORMANCE
AS
THE
SUPERDUPER
ALPHA
HERE
PERFORMANCE
IS
THE
WEIRD
THAT
EVERYONE
REFERS
TO
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
HEARD
THE
ALPHA
STILL
KICKS
IN
THE
BUTT
IN
FP
AGAIN
THIS
IS
WHAT
I
HEARD
AND
IN
THE
COMPUTING
WORLD
IF
YOU
SELL
LOTS
OF
CHIPS
LIKE
INTEL
AND
MAKE
IT
FASTER
LIKE
INTEL
YOU
ARE
THE
WINNER
LIKE
INTEL
EVEN
THOUGH
YOU
HAVE
A
SUCKY
ARCHITECTURE
FROM
OVER
YEARS
AGO
LIKE
INTEL
IF
YOU
CAN
MAKE
A
CISC
CHIP
SUPERSCALAR
SUPERDUPERPIPELINED
SUPERFAST
WITH
THE
IDEAS
BEHIND
THE
RISC
IDEOLOGY
YOU
GOT
A
CISC
CHIP
AND
THEN
I
ADMIT
I
CANT
SEE
THE
ADVANTAGES
OF
RISC
OVER
CISC
IF
THE
LATEST
TECHNOLOGY
IS
A
GENERATION
BEHIND
THEN
IT
SUCKS
RELATIVELY
SPEAKING
NOW
I
MAY
SOUND
LIKE
I
LIKE
INTEL
BUT
ILL
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
IS
SOME
REAL
KICK
BUTT
PILE
OF
SI
AND
BUT
I
HOPE
THAT
MOTOROLA
REALLY
CATCHES
UP
WITH
THE
LINE
OR
IM
GONNA
START
CRYING
