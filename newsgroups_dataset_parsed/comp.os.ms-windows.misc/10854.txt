INFO
ON
WINDOWS
HELP
FILES
HERE
IS
THE
LATEST
ON
RELOCATING
YOUR
HELP
FILES
TO
A
SERVER
THE
WINHELP
FUNCTION
AS
I
AM
TOLD
BY
MS
DOES
SEARCH
YOUR
PATH
SO
RELOCATING
MS
WINDOWS
HELPFILES
WONT
BE
A
PROBLEM
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
INCLUDE
THE
PATH
TO
WHERE
YOU
MOVE
THEM
TO
HOWEVER
IF
AN
APPLICATION
HAS
HARDCODED
THE
PATH
INTO
THEIR
CODE
SO
THAT
WHEN
WINHELP
IS
INVOKED
IT
SEARCHES
THE
GIVEN
PATH
IE
WINHELPHWND
CAMIPRO
FOR
EXAMPLE
THEN
WINHELP
DOES
NOT
SEARCH
YOUR
PATH
AND
INSTEAD
LOOKS
ONLY
TO
THAT
DIRECTORY
WHERE
YOU
HAVE
INSTALLED
YOUR
SOFTWARE
I
TESTED
THIS
OUT
ON
A
VARIETY
OF
SOFTWARE
PACKAGES
I
MOVED
ALL
MY
HELPFILES
TO
THE
DRIVE
Z
AND
INCLUDED
THIS
IN
THE

STATEMENT
HERE
IS
THE
