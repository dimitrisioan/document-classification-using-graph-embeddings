SO
TO
MOST
OF
THE
COMPUTER
USERS
IN
THE
WORLD
MS
PRODUCT
SYMBOLIZE
QUALITY
MS
HAS
MADE
THEIR
LIFE
EASIER
AND
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
AND
TO
THEM
THAT
IS
QUALITY
THEY

NOT

NONE

THE

NEVER
CHOOSE
THE
BEST
OPTION
AVAILABLE
TO

THEY
CHOOSE
THE
ONE
WHICH
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
CONDITIONED
TO
THINK
IS
BEST
IM
GLAD
IM
NOT
ONE
