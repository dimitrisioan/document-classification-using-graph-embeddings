this
may
be
an
faq
if
so
please
direct
me
to
the
known
answer
but
i
am
getting
frustrated
and
looking
for
help
i
am
running
win
with
ndw
on
a
with
meg
of
memory
and
a
meg
perm
swap
file
and
am
getting
exceedingly
frustrated
that
my
applications
are
not
giving
back
system
resources
when
i
close
them
i
am
aware
this
is
a
known
problem
what
i
am
looking
for
are
some
suggestions
of
what
i
might
do
to
mitigate
it
what
software
is
the
culprit
win
ndw
my
applications
are
some
modes
of
win
standard
real
enhanced
better
than
others
at
plugging
this
leak
its
the
applications
that
do
this
unfortunately
even
the
applets
that
ship
with
seem
to
have
this
problem
ive
seen
it
in
solitaire
for
example
are
their
systemini
switches
i
can
set
to
help
plug
this
leak
none
that
i
know
of
if
an
application
doesnt
give
back
the
resources
they
are
lost
and
gone
forever
pending
a
restart
of
windows
do
people
know
of
patches
or
third
party
software
that
help
with
this
seems
like
increasing
or
better
managing
system
resources
is
a
great
market
for
a
third
party
memory
company
like
qemm
if
the
applications
dont
free
up
the
memory
and
a
lot
of
them
dont
theres
bugger
all
that
any
other
piece
of
software
can
do
about
it
if
i
run
progman
instead
of
ndw
will
the
leak
subside
i
was
hoping
that
ndw
would
have
plugged
this
but
it
seems
no
different
than
in
how
it
deals
with
memory
and
resources
no
this
is
a
problem
with
the
applications
usually
when
i
am
writing
vb
code
are
there
things
i
can
do
to
make
it
less
likely
my
code
will
eat
resources
there
are
books
written
on
this
one
in
general
just
be
sure
to
free
up
everything
that
you
ask
for
before
you
exit
unfortunately
i
understand
that
vb
will
internally
lose
resources
for
you
so
theres
no
way
to
avoid
this
entirely
any
other
suggestions
that
i
dont
know
enough
to
ask
for
specifically
thanks
for
your
help
as
this
is
a
common
problem
and
i
have
seen
only
a
little
discussion
of
it
on
the
net
there
are
probably
others
who
would
like
to
read
answers
so
please
publish
here
rather
than
sending
me
email
theres
little
discussion
because
its
inevitable
until
ms
manages
to
come
up
with
an
os
that
will
do
garbage
collection
or
something
on
the
resource
pool
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
