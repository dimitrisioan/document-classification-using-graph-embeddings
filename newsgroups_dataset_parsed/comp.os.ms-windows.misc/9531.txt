hi
the
best
sound
conversion
program
ive
ever
seen
is
soundtool
which
is
shareware
from
germany
i
found
a
copy
somewhere
in
wuarchivewustledu
a
long
time
ago
but
i
dont
know
offhand
what
directory
it
was
under
its
great
at
converting
files
of
all
types
including
mac
next
sun
and
various
pc
formats
its
also
a
great
player
and
editor
with
various
special
effects
that
put
windows
sound
recorder
to
shame
it
requires
a
driver
for
various
sound
cards
the
only
builtin
one
is
for
the
pc
speaker
and
even
that
sounds
pretty
good
but
if
youre
just
using
it
to
convert
things
you
can
convert
them
in
soundtool
and
then
play
them
in
sound
recorder
give
it
a
try
bret
why
thats
the
second
