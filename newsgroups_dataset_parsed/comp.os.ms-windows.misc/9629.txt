RE
BORLANDS
PARADOX
OFFER
I
AM
CONSIDERING
BUYING
BORLANDS
PARADOX
FOR
WINDOWS
SINCE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
USE
A
DATABASE
WITH
WINDOWS
I
DONT
HAVEUSE
ONE
YET
FOR
BOTH
WORKHOME
USE
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ADVANTAGE
OF
BORLANDS
UNTIL
APRIL
OFFER
IF
THIS
PACKAGE
IS
EVERYTHING
THAT
BORLAND
CLAIMS
IT
TO
BE
SO
I
WAS
WONDERING
HAS
ANYBODY
USED
THIS
ANDOR
HAVE
ANY
OPINIONS
TOM
BELMONTE
IF
YOU
ARE
INTERESTED
IN
A
PROGRAM
WHICH
IS
VERY
EASY
TO
USE
I
STRONGLY
SUGGEST
APPROACH
IT
IS
EXTREMELY
EASY
TO
USE
MAKE
REPORTS
ETC
I
OWN
BOTH
IT
AND
PARADOX
AND
I
ALMOST
NEVER
USE
PARADOX
IF
YOU
NEED
TO
BUILD
UP
A
COMPLICATED
APPLICATION
THEN
PARADOX
IS
THE
WAY
TO
GO
I
HAVE
HEARD
HORROR
STORIES
ABOUT
THE
ACCESS
PROGRAMMING
BEING
EXTREMELY
CRYPTIC
SINCE
YOU
SEEM
LIKE
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
DOING
FAIRLY
SMALL
STUFF
WORK
HOME
USE
AND
YOU
HAVE
NOT
USED
A
DATABASE
BEFORE
I
RECOMMEND
APPROACH
I
HAVE
FOUND
ONLY
ONE
SMALL
THING
WHICH
I
WOULD
LIKE
IT
TO
DO
MORE
EASILY
I
HAVE
ONE
DATABASE
WHERE
THE
ORDER
IN
WHICH
THE
RECORDS
ARE
ENTERED
MUST
BE
DIFFERENT
THAN
WHAT
IS
THE
LOGICAL
ORDERING
TO
PERMANENTLY
REORDER
TO
USE
THE
OLD
DBASE
III
COMMAND
THE
RECORDS
REQUIRES
SORTING
THE
RECORDS
APPROPRIATELY
NO
PROBLEM
SINCE
I
ALMOST
ALWAYS
USE
THEM
IN
THIS
ORDER
EXPORTING
THE
DATABASE
TO
ANOTHER
DATABASE
WHICH
CAN
STILL
BE
AN
APPROACH
DATABASE
AND
THEN
COPYING
THE
EXPORTED
FILES
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
FILENAME
THIS
IS
A
SMALL
WEAKNESS
CONSIDERING
THE
OTHER
ITEMS
I
REALLY
LIKE
ABOUT
APPROACH
IT
IS
ALSO
A
LITTLE
SLOWER
THAN
PARADOX
OTHER
THAN
THE
LOADING
PARADOX
TAKES
FOREVER
AND
A
MINUTE
TO
LOAD
PARADOX
ALSO
TAKES
A
LOT
OF
MEMORY
BOTH
HARD
DISK
AROUND
AND
RAM
