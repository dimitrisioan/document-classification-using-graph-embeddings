im
using
word
for
windows
and
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
it
except
the
equation
editor
screws
up
all
the
time
when
i
try
to
insert
an
equation
it
will
give
me
two
errors
fence
font
not
found
and
meta
font
not
found
the
real
problem
is
that
it
will
not
display
or
print
out
the
integral
sign
does
anyone
else
have
this
problem
and
how
do
i
solve
it
im
using
a
zsport
laptop
with
a
panasonic
printer
running
msdos
and
windows
thanks
falke
we
all
had
that
problem
you
need
to
expand
the
fonts
manually
the
program
decomp
is
on
disk

fonts
are
on
disk

fun
