HAS
ANYONE
HAD
PROBLEMS
WITH
AMI
PRO
AFTER
RUNNING
PCTOOLS
COMPRESS

FIRST
TIME

TRY
TO
RUN

CAUSES
I
THINK
IT
WAS
A
SEGMENTATION
FAULT
IN
AMIPROEXE

FINISHES
WITH
ALL
TIMES
AFTER
THAT
ONLY
MANAGING
TO
GET
TO
THE
LOGO
BOX
THAT
FIRST
POPS
UP
WHEN
IT
BEGINS
LOADING
AND
THEN
CAUSES
A
GENERAL
PROTECTION
FAULT
IN
MODULE
AMIPROUIDLL
AT

HAVE
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
FIX
THIS
PROBLEM
EXCEPT
BY
REINSTALLING

HAS
HAPPENED
TWICE

BOTH
TIMES

AFTER
HAVING
RAN
