IS
SUPPOSED
TO
READ
AND
WRITE
MAC
DISKS
IVE
NEVER
TRIED
IT
THOUGH
GOOD
LUCK
I
JUST
TRIED
IT
BUT
I
CANT
SAY
THAT
IT
WORKS
CAUSE
IT
DOESNT
READ
DISKS
IT
ONLY
READS
IF
THERE
A
PROGRAM
THAT
DOES
READ
DISKS
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
THE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
DO
THIS
IS
IF
YOU
CAN
SEND
THE
FILES
ACCROSS
THE
NETWORK
THIS
IS
MUCH
EASIER
GOING
FROM
A
MAC
TO
A
PC
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
HAVE
TO
WORRY
ABOUT
LOSING
THE
RESOURCE
FORK
OF
THE
FILE
OFTEN
A
PROBLEM
WHEN
SENDING
BINARY
FILES
FROM
A
