DEAN
WRITES
IVE
BEEN
READING
WITH
MUCH
CONFUSION
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
TO
USE
ATMANAGER
LATELY
ALL
THE
PACKAGES
IVE
BEEN
BUYING
HAVE
ALL
INCLUDED
ATMANAGER
AS
A
BONUS
I
DO
SOME
DESKTOP
PUBLISHING
USING
PAGEMAKER
AND
CORELDRAW
CORELDRAW
COMES
WITH
A
NIFTY
LASER
DISK
THAT
CONTAINS
OVER
DIFF
TYPES
ADD
THAT
TO
THE
TTFONTS
THAT
COME
WITH
AND
YOU
HAVE
A
DECENT
AMOUNT
OF
FONTS
I
PRINT
MY
CREATIONS
OUT
ON
AN
POSTCRIPT
AT
DPI
RESOLUTION
WITH
THE
RESOLUTION
ENHANCEMENT
TECHNOLOGY
AND
WELL
I
GET
SOME
DARN
GOOD
COPIES
SO
GOOD
THAT
THERE
ISNT
ANY
DIFF
WHETHER
OR
NOT
ATMANAGER
IS
TURNED
ON
OR
NOT
IS
IT
WORTH
IT
TO
RUN
ATM
AT
ALL
ESPECIALLY
WITH
THESE
BETTER
PRINTER
TECHNOLOGIES
AND
TT
ATM
WILL
DO
NOTHING
FOR
YOUR
TRUETYPE
FONTS
IF
YOUR
TRUETYPE
FONTS
ARE
SUFFICIENT
FOR
YOUR
NEEDS
DONT
RUN
ATM
I
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
FONTS
THAT
I
CAN
INSTALL
EITHER
AS
POSTSCRIPT
UNDER
ATM
OR
AS
TRUETYPE
I
HAVE
NOTICED
THAT
TRUETYPE
FONT
FILES
ARE
AT
LEAST
LARGER
THAN
THEIR
EQUIVALENTS
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
A
DISK
COMPRESSOR
THOUGH
BE
AWARE
THAT
TRUETYPE
FONTS
WILL
COMPRESS
WHEREAS
FONTS
WILL
NOT
THEY
ARE
ENCRYPTED
WITH
A
DPI
LASER
PRINTER
THE
ARTIFICIAL
BOLD
VERSION
OF
A
TRUETYPE
FONT
IS
INDISTINGISHABLE
FROM
THE
ORIGINAL
FORCING
ME
TO
INSTALL
THE
ACTUAL
BOLD
AND
BOLDITALIC
ETC
VARIANTS
IF
I
WANT
TO
USE
THEM
POSTSCRIPT
FONTS
UNDER
ATM
GENERATE
A
VISUALLY
DISTINCT
BOLD
VARIANT
FROM
THE
BASE
FONT
I
REALIZE
THAT
THE
ARTIFICIAL
BOLD
FONT
THAT
ATM
GENERATES
IS
AESTHETICALLY
INFERIOR
TO
THE
HANDGENERATED
BOLD
TRUETYPE
VARIANT
BUT
IT
IS
SUFFICIENT
FOR
MY
NEEDS
AND
NOT
HAVING
TO
INSTALL
BOLD
VARIANTS
