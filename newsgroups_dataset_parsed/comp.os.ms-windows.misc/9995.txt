APPRECIATE
IF
YOU
CAN
EMAIL
OR
POST
YOU
POSITIVE
OR
NEGATIVE
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THIS
MONITOR
ESPECIALLY
COMPARED
TO
TO
NANAO
ID
SUMMARIZE
IF
I
GOT
MULTIPLE
RESPONSES
I
BOUGHT
A
VIEWSONIC
FOR
USE
AT
HOME
BUT
AFTER
A
WEEK
I
TOOK
IT
BACK
I
FELT
FOR
THE
MONEY
MY
NEC
THAT
I
USE
AT
WORK
WAS
A
MUCH
BETTER
MONITOR
THE
NEC
IS
SHARPER
FLATTER
LESS
DISTORTED
AND
MORE
STABLE
I
HAVE
HEARD
COMPLAINTS
FROM
PEOPLE
ABOUT
THE
NEC
FG
SERIES
HAVING
SOME
QUALITY
CONTROL
PROBLEMS
BUT
MINE
HAS
BEEN
IN
USE
FOR
ABOUT
A
YEAR
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
AT
ALL
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
REALLY
BROKEN
WITH
THE
VIEWSONIC
BUT
OVERALL
IT
DID
NOT
MATCH
UP
I
USED
MY
ATI
GRAPHICS
ULTRA
IN
SETUP
MODE
TO
PUSH
THE
FREQUENCIES
TO
THEIR
LIMITS
AND
THE
VIEWSONIC
EXHIBITED
SOME
PROBLEMS
THAT
THE
NEC
DID
NOT
I
PERSONALLY
LIKE
THE
NONETCHED
NEC
WITH
THE
OCLI
FILTER
AND
THE
TUBE
ON
THE
WAS
NOT
AS
NICE
THE
HAD
SOME
UNCORRECTABLE
PINCUSION
AND
EDGE
DISTORTION
PROBLEMS
ALSO
IT
WOULD
CHANGE
BRIGHTNESS
WHEN
I
SWITCHED
MODES
AND
I
WAS
CONSTANTLY
HAVING
TO
FIDDLE
WITH
THE
CONTROLS
AND
THE
YOKE
WAS
CROOKED
AND
I
HAD
NO
WAY
TO
COMPENSATE
FOR
THE
RASTER
THAT
TILTED
DOWNHILL
ON
THE
POSTIVE
SIDE
ALTHOUGH
NOT
AS
HANDSOME
AS
THE
NEC
THE
HAD
A
SMALLER
FOOTPRINT
AND
WAS
NOT
AS
HEAVY
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
PANASONIC
OWNS
VIEWSONIC
AND
THE
MODEL
IS
BEING
SOLD
THROUGH
OEM
CHANNELS
WITH
A
PANASONIC
LABEL
ON
IT
IF
ITS
AVAILABLE
THAT
WAY
AT
A
LOWER
COST
I
COULD
GET
MORE
SERIOUS
ABOUT
IT
FOR
NOW
THE
NEC
HAS
MY
VOTE
BUT
IM
SEARCHING
FOR
ONE
OF
THE
NEW
CHEAPER
NEC
TO
SEE
IF
ITS
JUST
AS
GOOD
AS
ITS
OLDER
BROTHER
THE
BEFORE
I
DECIDE
WHICH
ONE
TO
BUY
I
HAVE
NO
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THE
NANAO
I
CAN
NEVER
KEEP
THE
NANAO
MODELS
STRAIGHT
AND
DONT
HAVE
ANY
PLACE
I
CAN
WALK
IN
TO
GET
A
GOOD
COMPARISON

ALL
MODELS
