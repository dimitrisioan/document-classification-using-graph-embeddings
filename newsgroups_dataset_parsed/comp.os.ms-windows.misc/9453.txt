WRITES
WHEN
I
USE
A
NAME
SUCH
AS
ROSEVCROSEHULMANEDU
INITIATING
NAMESERVER
QUERY
FOR
ROSEVC
NAMESERVER
QUERY
TIME
OUT
WHEN
I
USE
THE
IP
NUMBER
LOCAL
HOST
OR
GATEWAY
NOT
RESPONDING
I
KNOW
THE
NAMESERVER
IS
CORRECT
AND
THE
ROUTER
IS
CORRECT
THEY
WORK
FINE
USING
NCSA
TELNETFTP
THEY
ARE
WORKING
OK
BUT
YOUR
DEFINITIONS
IN
QVTNETINI
AND
QVTHOSTRC
ARE
INCORRECT
SEE
BELOW
THE
DOCS
SAID
IF
YOU
ARE
RUNNING
CONCURRENT
PACKET
SOFTWARE
YOU
NEED
TO
LOAD
PKTMUX
DOES
THIS
APPLY
TO
ME
NO
I
DONT
THINK
SO
YOU
ARE
USING
QVTNET
AND
NOVELL
CONCURRENTLY
ARENT
YOU
THEY
USE
DIFFERENT
PACKET
TYPES
SO
QVTNET
TCPIP
AND
NOVELL
IPXSPX
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
COEXIST
JUST
FINE
PKTMUX
IS
REQUIRED
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
DIFFERENT
TCPIPPACKAGES
CONCURRENTLY
THIS
IS
THE
QVTHOSTRC
FILE
THERE
IS
THE
FIRST
PROBLEM
YOU
DIDNT
SPECIFY
HOSTNAMES
JUST
IPADDRESSES
YOUR
FILE
SHOULD
LOOK
LIKE
THIS
NAME
OF
YOUR
NAMESERVER
NAME
OF
YOUR
ROUTER
THIS
IS
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
WINQVTINI
FILE
NET
NAMESWARTZJHTESTROSEHULMANEDU
HERE
YOU
SHOULD
ONLY
SPECIFY
YOUR
HOSTNAME
WITHOUT
THE
DOMAIN
PART
INSTEAD
USE
ROUTERNAME
OF
YOUR
ROUTER
AS
SPECIFIED
IN
YOUR
QVTHOSTRC
I
KNOW
THE
RELEASE
NOTES
FOR
SAY
THAT
IP
ADDRESSES
SHOULD
WORK
ALSO
BUT
APPARENTLY
THEY
DONT
HERE
TOO
YOU
SHOULD
USE
THE
HOSTNAME
OF
THE
NAMESERVER
INSTEAD
OF
THE
IP
ADDRESS
IT
WORKED
FINE
FOR
ME
THAT
WAY
ALTHOUGH
I
COULD
NOT
SPECIFY
MORE
THAN
ONE
NAMESERVER
THE
RELNOTES
SAY
IT
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
TO
SPECIFY
UP
TO
THREE
NAMESERVERS
SEPARATED
BY
COMMAS
BUT
IT
DIDNT
WORK
HOPE
IT
