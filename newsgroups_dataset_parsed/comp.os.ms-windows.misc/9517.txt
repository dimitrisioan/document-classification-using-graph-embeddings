WINDOWS
KEEPS
CRASHING
PLEASE
HELP
AS
THE
SUBJECTS
SAYS
WINDOWS
KEEPS
CRASHING
GIVINH
ME
GPF
ON
ME
OF
LATE
IT
WAS
NEVER
A
VERY
STABLE
PACKAGE
BUT
NOW
IT
SEEMS
TO
CRASH
EVERY
DAY
THE
WORST
PART
ABOUT
IT
IS
THAT
IT
DOES
NOT
CRASH
CONSISTENTLY
IE
I
CANT
REPRODUCE
CRASHES
AND
THEY
ARE
NOT
ALWAYS
GPFS
IN
THE
SAME
APPLICATION
SOMETIMES
I
CAN
RECOVER
BY
SIMPLY
CLOSING
THE
APPLICATION
THAT
CAUSED
AN
ERROR
BUT
OTHER
TIMES
WINDOWS
ACTS
VERY
STRANGE
AND
I
NEED
TO
REBOOT
SOME
BACKGROUND
I
HAVE
A
LEADING
EDGE
WITH
PHOENIX
BIOS
WHEN
I
FIRST
GOT
IT
IT
HAD
OF
MEMORY
IT
RAN
WINDOWS
FINE
NOT
TOO
MANY
GPFS
THEN
A
COUPLE
OF
WEEKENDS
AGO
I
INSTALLED
LOTUS
FOR
WINDOWS
WITH
ATM
A
GAME
CARD
AND
AN
ADDITIONAL
SIMMS
THE
LEADING
EDGE
MACHINE
IS
KIND
OF
STRANGE
IN
THAT
IT
HAS
THE
IDE
CONTROLER
BUILT
INTO
THE
MOTHERBOARD
THE
CPU
IS
ACTUALLY
ON
A
SPARATE
BOARD
THAT
PLUGS
INTO
THE
MOTHERBOARD
AND
THE
SIMMS
IT
USES
ARE
MACINTOSH
SIMMS
APPARENTLY
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
THE
LEADING
EDGE
HAD
THE
PARITY
BIT
BUILT
INTO
THE
MOTHER
BOARD
THE
ORIGINAL
SIMMS
WHERE
OF
THE
CHIP
VARIETY
FROM
SAMSUNG
AND
THE
ONES
I
INSTALLED
ARE
CHIP
SIMMS
THEY
ARE
RECOGNIZED
FINE
BY
THE
BIOS
RAM
CHECK
THE
GAME
CARD
IS
A
GENERIC
GAMECARD
THE
REASON
WHY
I
MENTION
THE
HARDWARE
LIKE
THIS
IS
THAT
SOMETIMES
REBOOTING
THE
MACHINE
USING
THE
RESET
BUTTON
OR
CTLALTDEL
STILL
LEAVES
THE
MACHINE
KIND
OF
FLAKY
BUT
TURNING
IT
ON
AND
OFF
DOESNT
I
HAVENT
TRIED
TAKING
OUT
THE
RAM
OR
THE
GAME
CARD
BECAUSE
AS
I
SAID
THESE
GPF
ARE
NOT
REPRODUCIBLE
AT
WILL
I
HAVE
GONE
THROUGH
AND
ENTIRE
DAY
USING
THE
COMPUTER
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
AND
THEN
I
MIGHT
GET
OR
SO
GPFS
IN
THE
SPPACE
OF
MINUTES
WHAT
CAN
I
DO
THIS
SITUATION
IS
MOST
ANNOYING
ARE
THERE
ANY
GOOD
DIAGNOSTIC
TOOLS
FOR
HARDWARE
DO
YOU
THINK
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
BE
A
SOFTWARE
PROBLEM
IE
ETC
IF
IT
HELPS
I
HAVE
MANAGE
TO
GET
GPFS
ON
AFTER
DARK
QUICKEN
PAINT
SHOP
PRO
A
LOT
OF
THEM
HAVE
BEEN
IN
USEREXE
OR
GDIEXE
ANY
HELP
IS
TRULY
APPRECIATED
