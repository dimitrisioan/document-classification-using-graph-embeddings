PROBLEM
TOM

HELLO
I
RECENTLY
TRIED
TO
PRINT
SOME
ENVELOPES
USING
AMIPRO
WITH
MY
DESKJET
PRINTER
AND
I
SEEM
TO
BE
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
AFTER
I
PHYSICALLY
LOAD
THE
ENVELOPE
INTO
THE
PRINTER
PER
THE
USER
MANUAL
AND
THEN
SELECT
THE
PRINT
ENVELOPE
ICON
FROM
AMIPRO
ALL
OF
THE
PROPER
OPTIONS
HAVE
BEEN
SELECTED
THE
PRINTER
JUST
SPITS
OUT
THE
ENVELOPE
WITHOUT
ANY
PRINTING
OF
EITHER
A
RETURN
ADDRESS
OR
THE
SELECTED
MAILING
ADDRESS
AT
THIS
POINT
THE
PRINTERS
ONLINE
LIGHT
BEGINS
TO
FLASH
AND
THE
PRINT
MANAGER
SHOWS
THE
PRINTER
JOB
AS
BUSY
THIS
IS
ALL
THAT
HAPPENS
UNTIL
I
EITHER
SHUT
THE
PRINTER
OFF
OR
CANCEL
THE
PRINTING
JOB
FROM
THE
PRINT
MANAGER
I
HAVE
ALSO
TRIED
THIS
WITHOUT
THE
USE
OF
THE
PRINT
MANAGER
WITH
SIMILAR
RESULTS
AMIPRO
SHOWS
THE
PRINTER
AS
BEING
BUSY
SO
DOES
ANYBODY
HAVE
ANY
IDEASOLUTION
REGARDING
THIS
PROBLEM
I
APPRECIATE
THE
HELP
THANKS
YES
IGNORE
THE
MANUAL
JUST
INSERT
THE
EVELOPE
DONT
USE
THE
KEYPAD
TO
MOVE
IT
UP
THE
WINDOWS
DRIVER
SENDS
A
MESSAGE
TO
THE
PRINTER
THAT
TELLS
IT
TO
LOAD
THE
ENVELOPE
IF
IT
IS
ALREADY
LOADED
IT
GETS
EJECTED
AND
THE
PRINTER
