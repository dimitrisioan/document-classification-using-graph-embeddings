WORKSPACE
MANAGERS
FOR
WIN
A
SMALL
REVIEW
THANKS
TO
ALL
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO
RECOMMENDED
WORKSPACE
MANAGERS
FOR
WINDOWS
I
FOUND
SHAREWARE
WORKSPACE
MANAGERS
FROM
AUSTRALIAS
MSWINDOWS
ARCHIVE
WHICH
MIRRORS
SOME
SITES
IN
THE
US
THE
THREE
I
FOUND
WERE
WORKSPACES
WSPACEZIP
THIS
WAS
THE
SMALLEST
AND
SIMPLEST
OF
THE
WORKSPACE
MANAGERS
THAT
I
FOUND
IT
IS
VERY
EASY
TO
USE
IT
DISPLAYS
A
SMALL
WINDOW
CONTAINING
BUTTONS
PLUS
AN
EXTRA
BUTTON
FOR
CONFIGURATION
PURPOSES
ONE
ANNOYING
FEATURE
WAS
THE
TITLE
WINDOW
THAT
IS
FIRST
PRESENTED
WHEN
IT
IS
RUN
YOU
MUST
PRESS
A
KEY
NOT
A
MOUSE
BUTTON
FOR
THE
THING
TO
GO
AWAY
ALSO
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NICE
IF
THERE
WAS
AN
ALWAYS
ON
TOP
SETTING
FOR
THE
LITTLE
WINDOW
CONTAINING
THE
WORKSPACE
BUTTONS
MAYBE
SOME
USERSPECIFIED
STRINGS
ON
THE
BUTTONS
INSTEAD
OF
THE
NUMBERS
ONE
TO
SIX
MIGHT
BE
A
NICE
FEATURE
THE
SIMPLICITY
AND
EASE
OF
USE
OF
THIS
WORKSPACE
MANAGER
MAKES
IT
AN
ATTRACTIVE
PACKAGE
WORKSHIFT
WHILE
THIS
WORKSPACE
MANAGER
OFFERED
A
FEW
FEATURES
THAT
WORKSPACES
LACKED
IT
WAS
QUITE
TIME
CONSUMING
TO
SET
THINGS
UP
WITH
WORKSPACES
ALL
BUT
THE
FIRST
WORKSPACE
IS
INITIALLY
EMPTY
WITH
WORKSHIFT
YOU
NEED
TO
TAKE
SNAPSHOTS
OF
HOW
YOU
WANT
EACH
OF
YOUR
WORKSPACES
TO
LOOK
LIKE
IE
WHAT
APPLICATIONS
THEY
CONTAIN
ALSO
THE
MAIN
WINDOW
IS
QUITE
LARGE
BUT
THIS
DOES
ALLOW
YOU
TO
HAVE
A
SMALL
VIEW
OF
WHAT
IS
IN
EACH
WORKSPACE
WITH
WORKSPACES
THERE
WAS
NO
FACILITY
FOR
VIEWING
WHAT
WAS
IN
A
WORKSPACE
WITHOUT
SWITCHING
TO
IT
WORKSHIFT
PROVIDES
THIS
VIEWING
FUNCTIONALITY
WHICH
IS
QUITE
USEFUL
BIGDESK
AND
BACKMENU
BACKDESKZIP
THIS
IS
AN
INTERESTING
PACKAGE
WHICH
CONTAINS
A
FEW
OTHER
GOODIES
AS
WELL
AS
A
WORKSPACE
MANAGER
OTHER
GOODIES
INCLUDE
BACKMENU
WHICH
PROVIDES
A
POPUP
ROOT
MENU
WHEN
YOU
PRESS
A
CERTAIN
MOUSE
BUTTON
JUST
LIKE
IN
XWINDOWS
THE
MENU
IS
TOTALLY
CONFIGURABLE
OFFERING
UNLIMITED
DEPTH
OF
CASCADING
MENUS
WHICH
IS
PROVIDES
QUITE
HANDY
ACCESS
TO
APPLICATIONS
YOU
COULD
SAY
IT
IS
A
MENUBASED
ALTERNATIVE
TO
THE
PROGRAM
MANAGER
ALSO
BUNDLED
IN
BACKDESKZIP
IS
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
WRUN
WHICH
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
RUN
WINDOWS
APPLICATIONS
FROM
A
DOS
SHELL
UNDER
WINDOWS
INSTEAD
OF
USING
THE
FILE
MANAGER
TO
RUN
APPLICATIONS
THE
ACTUAL
WORKSPACE
MANAGER
IS
CALLED
BIGDESK
BIGDESK
WORKS
QUITE
DIFFERENTLY
TO
THE
OTHER
TWO
WORKSPACE
MANAGERS
IN
THAT
IT
DOESNT
PROVIDE
A
CERTAIN
NUMBER
OF
DISJOINT
AND
SEPARATE
WORKSPACES
IN
FACT
IT
BASICALLY
ENLARGES
YOUR
DESKTOP
BY
A
CONFIGURABLE
AMOUNT
AND
YOU
CHOOSE
WHICH
REGION
OF
THE
DESKTOP
YOU
WANT
YOUR
SCREEN
TO
FOCUS
IN
ON
THIS
MEANS
YOU
CAN
HAVE
WINDOWS
OVERLAPPING
BETWEEN
DIFFERENT
VIEWING
REGIONS
UNLIKE
THE
FIRST
TWO
WORKSPACE
MANAGERS
IN
WHICH
EACH
WORKSPACE
WAS
ISOLATED
FROM
THE
OTHER
ONE
THE
BIGDESK
CONTROL
WINDOW
ALLOWS
TO
TO
MOVE
WINDOWS
AROUND
YOUR
ENLARGED
DESKTOP
BASICALLY
THE
CONTROL
WINDOW
PROVIDES
A
SMALL
SCALE
VIEW
OF
YOUR
VIEWING
AREA
WHILE
YOUR
ACTUAL
COMPUTER
SCREEN
PROVIDES
A
LARGE
SCALE
OR
BLOWUP
OF
A
PARTICULAR
SECTION
TRY
EACH
OF
THEM
OUT
FOR
YOURSELF
I
WAS
IMPRESSED
WITH
ALL
OF
THEM
SO
FIND
OUT
WHICH
ONE
SUITS
YOUR
NEEDS
THE
BEST
