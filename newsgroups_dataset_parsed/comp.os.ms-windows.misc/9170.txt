i
am
having
a
problem
configuring
the
mouse
in
windows
to
use
with
and
are
being
used
to
support
two
hour
bbs
lines
there
you
go
and
use
the
same
irq
therefore
you
cant
use
a
mouse
on
and
a
modem
on
or
vice
versa
its
a
limitation
of
dos
and
in
fact
windows
will
not
see
a
mouse
on
anything
other
than
or
accept
this
fact
and
either
get
a
bus
mouse
or
get
a
new
computer
i
would
also
like
to
know
if
it
is
possible
to
use
the
mouse
on
ports
other
than
or
no
the
advice
above
applies
