true
type
or
atm
seen
from
a
typographically
point
of
view
atm
using
postscript
fonts
is
better
than
truetype
the
hinting
mechanism
incorporated
in
ps
is
gorgeous
multilingual
users
may
see
the
limit
of
possible
different
characters
in
a
ps
font
as
problematically
they
may
have
better
use
of
the
unicode
features
of
tt
fonts
in
windows
nt
ive
seen
lots
of
really
beautiful
and
printableinsmallsize
ps
fonts
i
havent
seen
those
as
tt
fonts
most
of
them
are
rendering
quite
inaccurate
in
small
sizes
esp
as
screen
fonts
simply
compare
timesnewroman
as
a
ps
font
with
the
tt
font
the
first
looks
better
i
am
hoping
that
there
will
be
