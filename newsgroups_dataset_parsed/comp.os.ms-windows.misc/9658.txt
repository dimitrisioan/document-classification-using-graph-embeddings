does
anyone
know
if
it
is
possible

use
and
lan
workplace
for
dos

the
same
time

using
both
and
they
work
just
fine
hopefully
someday
wfwg

to
load

use
odi
with
odinsup
and
all
works
well
hey
sounds
great

that
mean
that

odi
i
thought
it
uses
ndis
my
problem
is
that
lan
workplace
with
all
its
drivers

up
most
of
my
umbs
so
id
hate
to
have
to
load

read
in
a
german
computer
magazine
that
tcpip
support
for

just
around
the
corner

about
this
