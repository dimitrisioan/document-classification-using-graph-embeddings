DISK
IMAGE
QUESTION
HELLO
RECENTLY
I
NOTICED
THERE
IS
A
DIRECTORY
NAMED
DISKIMAGE
IN
MY
DISK
I
DIDNT
NOTICE
IT
BEFORE
AND
I
WONDER
IF
WHILE
INSTALLING
AN
APPLICATION
AN
IMAGE
OF
THE
DISK
WAS
CREATED
OR
IF
AUTOMATICALLY
CREATED
A
BACKUP
OF
ITS
FILES
I
COULDNT
FIND
ANY
DOCUMENTATION
ON
THE
DISKIMAGE
UTILITY
HAVING
AN
IMAGE
OF
THE
DISK
IS
TAKING
A
LOT
OF
DISK
SPACE
DOES
ANYBODY
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
JUST
SOMETHING
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
INSTALLED
DID
OR
IT
IS
A
BACKUP
MECHANISM
THANKS
