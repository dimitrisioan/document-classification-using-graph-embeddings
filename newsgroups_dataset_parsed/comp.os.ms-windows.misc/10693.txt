question
hello
recently
i
noticed
there
is
a
directory
named
diskimage
in
my
disk
i
didnt
notice
it
before
and
i
wonder
if
while
installing
an
application
an
image
of
the
disk
was
created
or
if
automatically
created
a
backup
of
its
files
i
couldnt
find
any
documentation
on
the
diskimage
utility
having
an
image
of
the
disk
is
taking
a
lot
of
disk
space
does
anybody
know
if
this
is
just
something
the
people
who
installed
did
or
it
is
a
backup
mechanism
thanks
