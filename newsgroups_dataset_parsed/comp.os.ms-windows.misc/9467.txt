my
understanding
is
that
to
copy
files
from
one
directory
to
another
on
the
same
drive
in
file
manager
using
a
mouse
you
hold
down
the
ctrl
key
while
dragging
the
file
from
one
directorys
window
to
the
other
this
works
for
me
about
of
the
time
the
other
the
file
gets
moved
rather
than
copied
anybody
else
encountered
this
i
tried
to
respond
by
email
but
all
attempts
bounced
the
condition
of
the
ctrl
key
before
you
press
the
mouse
button
makes
no
difference
whatsoever
you
have
to
be
holding
the
ctrl
key
when
you
release
the
mouse
button
if
you
want
to
force
a
copy
operation
heres
a
simple
experiment
select
a
file
and
begin
to
drag
it
no
ctrl
key
notice
that
the
files
icon
disappears
from
the
listing
window
now
watch
what
happens
to
that
icon
as
you
press
and
release
the
ctrl
key
keeping
the
mouse
button
pressed
all
the
while
in
addition
the
icon
that
you
are
dragging
will
show
a
while
you
are
holding
the
ctrl
key
indicating
that
the
file
is
being
copied
rather
than
moved
