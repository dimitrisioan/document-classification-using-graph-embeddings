after
setting
up
windows
for
using
my
cirrus
logic
vlb
graphicscard
it
moved
a
normal
window
from
one
place
to
another
what
i
was
wondering
why
is
it
not
using
the
bitblt
engine
which
is
suuposed
to
be
on
the
chip
how
are
the
experiences
here
have
i
done
something
wrong
the
has
its
own
set
of
drivers
you
may
be
using
the
drivers
intended
for
the
or
by
mistake
be
sure
you
have
the
driver
version
i
installed
the
mswin
multiresolution
drivers
which
where
supplied
with
the
card
dont
quote
me
on
this
one
but
id
steer
clear
of
the
multi
resolution
driver
that
allows
you
to
change
resolution
without
exiting
windows
i
think
its
buggy
also
if
there
are
newhopefully
faster
drrivers
around
i
would
love
to
how
to
get
hold
of
them
ftp
or
whatsoever
version
drivers
are
due
to
be
release
by
cirrus
soon
unfortunately
their
not
available
via
ftp
you
have
to
dial
up
their
bbs
in
the
usa
i
do
this
from
nz
using
a
modem
to
cut
down
on
phone
bills
it
took
me
around
minutes
to
download
the
driver
good
luck
