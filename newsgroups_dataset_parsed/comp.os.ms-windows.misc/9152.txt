ON
A
RAMDRIVE

FLANGLEYRHCCSVAXSFASUEDU
WRITES
STUFF
DELD
FOR
BANDWIDTHS
SAKE
WHY
SIGH
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
MORE
THAN
OF
MEMORY
USING
A
RAMDRIVE
WITH
WINDOWS
IS
A
WASTE
OF
MEMORY
WINDOWS
WILL
ACCESS
UPTO
RAM
BETTER
AS
MEMORY
AS
TO
WHY
WHAT
YOU
DID
DIDNT
WORK
IT
IS
BECAUSE
DRIVELETTERS
AND
PATHS
ARE
STORED
INSIDE
THE
GROUPPIFINI
FILES
ALL
OF
THE
SUDDEN
THINGS
WENT
FROM
DRIVE
C
TO
DRIVE
E
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
WANTED
TO
COPY
AN
APPLICATION
UP
TO
THE
RAMDRIVE
AND
RESETUP
IT
UP
THAT
SHOULD
WORK
NORMALLY
BUT
AS
PREVIOUSLY
STATED
THIS
WILL
ONLY
HURT
THINGS
UNLESS
YOUVE
GOT
MORE
THAN
OF
RAM
AND
ARE
USING
WHATS
ABOVE
AS
THE
RAMDRIVE
I
PERSONALLY
HAVE
OF
RAM
AND
RUN
A
RAMDRIVE
WITH
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
SUCCESS
HOWEVER
IF
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
TO
SPEED
UP
WINDOWS
THE
THREE
THINGS
IVE
NOTED
THAT
WORK
THE
BEST
ARE
A
GRAPHICS
ACCELLERATOR
CARD
A
COPROCESSOR
EVEN
AN
EMULATOR
HELPS
SOME
OTHER
DISKCACHE
BESIDES
SMARTDRIVE
IVE
TRIED
SEVERAL
AND
LIGHTNING
FOR
WINDOWS
AND
NORTON
CACHE
GIVE
ME
MAJOR
HEADACHES
AS
WELL
I
THINK
THE
PURPOSE
THE
ORIGINAL
POSTER
WAS
TRYING
TO
SERVE
IS
TO
AVOID
THE
SIGNIFICANT
AMOUNT
OF
DISK
ACCESS
THAT
WINDOWS
DOES
ON
STARTUP
ITS
LIKE
ITS
TRYING
TO
ITS
BIT
IN
WEARING
THE
DAMN
DRIVE
OUT
I
ESTIMATE
ITS
ONLY
READING
A
MB
OF
PROGRAMS
DATA
BUT
FROM
THE
PERFORMANCE
THE
DRIVE
GIVES
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
THEY
ARE
SCATTERED
ALL
OVER
THE
DRIVE
MY
DRIVE
IS
HOWEVER
REGULARILY
COMPRESSED
WHAT
IS
IT
THAT
TAKES
SO
MUCH
FUSS
PERHAPS
IF
MS
WOULD
TAKE
THE
TROUBLE
TO
OPTIMIZE
THIS
STARTUP
PROCESS
LESS
PEOPLE
WOULD
BE
WANTING
TO
FIND
A
SOLUTION
THEMSELVES
