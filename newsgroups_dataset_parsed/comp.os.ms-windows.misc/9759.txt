windows
i
created
a
permanent
swapfile
of
as
recommended
me
to
do
that
access
if
i
use
after
startup
i
have
of
memory
free
if
i
leave
out
of
my
configsys
i
have
of
memory
free
and
windows
recommends
me
a
swap
file
of
i
think
you
need
the
noems
this
will
let
the
expanded
mem
be
active
but
not
use
any
therefore
this
will
give
you
more
extended
mem
for
windows
yet
have
all
the
bases
covered
i
use
with
memmaker
have
of
internal
memory
and
a
i
do
not
use
so
i
am
not
familiar
with
this
does
anybody
knows
why
this
is
happening
possibly
win
needs
some
umbs
to
manage
virtual
memory
if
true
which
umbs
those
that
can
find
without
including
suspicious
parts
i
need
an
optimized
dosenvironment
because
i
develop
applications
for
dos
using
a
windows
programming
environment
