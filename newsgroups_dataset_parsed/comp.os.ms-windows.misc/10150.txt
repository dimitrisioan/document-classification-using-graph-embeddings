PRINT
TO
FILE
HOW
DO
I
PRINT
THE
FILE
LATER
HERES
THE
SITUATION
AT
HOME
I
HAVE
MS
WORD
FOR
WINDOWS
BUT
NO
PRINTER
AT
WORK
I
HAVE
WINDOWS
A
POSTSCRIPT
PRINTER
BUT
NOT
MS
WORD
SO
I
CONFIGURE
MY
MACHINE
AT
HOME
TO
USE
A
POSTSCRIPT
PRINTER
AND
USE
THE
PRINT
TO
FILE
OPTION
WHICH
PRODUCES
A
NICE
POSTSCRIPT
FILE
WHICH
I
THEN
BRING
TO
WORK
MY
QUESTION
HOW
DO
I
PRINT
THIS
POSTSCRIPT
FILE
THROUGH
THE
PRINT
MANAGER
AT
WORK
IF
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
SELECT
PRINT
FROM
THE
FILE
MANAGER
IT
TREATS
THE
POSTSCRIPT
AS
A
TEXT
FILE
AND
GIVES
ME
SEVERAL
PAGES
OF
POSTSCRIPT
GIBBERISH
I
KNOW
THAT
I
CAN
OPEN
A
DOS
WINDOW
AND
DO
COPY
FILEPS
WHICH
DOES
WORK
BUT
SEEMS
NOT
TO
MULTITASK
VERY
WELL
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
RUN
RATHER
SLOWLY
AND
OFTEN
PAUSE
FOR
OF
SECONDS
THERE
OUGHT
TO
BE
A
WAY
OF
PASSING
THE
POSTSCRIPT
FILE
TO
THE
PRINT
MANAGER
BUT
IF
THERE
IS
I
CANT
FIND
ANY
MENTION
OF
IT
IN
THE
DOCUMENTATION
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
TO
DO
