you
have
one
minimize
the
print
manager
and
drag
a
file
to
it
and
it
will
print
it
you
need
to
associate
file
extensions
with
such
things
as
the
notepad
for
it
to
do
this
though
this
may
work
but
wont
it
involve
invoking
the
applications
eg
if
you
drag
a
bmp
or
txt
file
to
the
min
print
manager
icon
wont
it
run
notepad
and
paintbrush
before
printing
if
you
just
want
to
drag
a
file
txt
or
bmp
to
a
print
server
icon
with
stay
at
front
attributes
you
need
an
intelligent
print
manager
drag
and
drop
client
like
amish
print
yes
it
invokes
the
associated
application
that
takes
but
seconds
