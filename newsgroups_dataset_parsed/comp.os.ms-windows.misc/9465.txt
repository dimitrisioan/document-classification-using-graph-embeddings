wanted
dialog
box
to
select
files
for
dos
apps
im
looking
for
a
program
that
will
let
me
use
a
windows
common
dialog
box
to
select
a
file
to
use
when
running
a
dos
app
basically
i
have
several
dos
apps
that
i
use
now
and
then
with
different
files
they
all
accept
a
file
as
a
command
line
parameter
but
the
only
way
at
least
that
i
know
of
to
do
this
easily
when
running
them
from
windows
is
to
set
up
the
pif
file
so
that
it
prompts
me
for
additional
parameters
at
which
point
i
type
in
the
file
name
problems
are
sometimes
i
cant
remember
where
the
file
is
exactly
located
and
it
would
be
nice
to
browse
my
directories
for
it
without
having
to
use
the
file
manager
and
im
lazy
and
hate
to
type
long
pathnames
for
files
burried
several
directory
levels
deep
if
anyone
can
point
me
to
such
a
program
or
let
me
know
of
some
other
way
to
handle
this
id
appreciate
it
thanks
tim
the
net
isnt
organized
enough
to
be
considered
an
anarchy
