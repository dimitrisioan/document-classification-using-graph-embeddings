AT

THERE
WERE
A
FEW
COMPUTERS
RUNNING
WINDOWS

APPS
FOR
THE
BLIND
I
THINK
DIDNT
PAY
MUCH
ATTENTION
TO
IT
BUT
IT
WAS

IT
SEEMS
THAT
A
PARTICULAR
PROGRAM
DESIGNED
FOR
BLIND

IS
MORE
IMPORTANT

TRYING
TO
INTERFACE
WINDOWS
WITH
A
WAY
FOR
BLIND
PEOPLE
TO
USE
IT
IF
SOMEONE
MADE
A

ORIENTED

IT
WOULD
PROBABLY
BEEN
MORE

I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
ORIGINAL
