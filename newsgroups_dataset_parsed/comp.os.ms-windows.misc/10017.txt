there
were
a
few
computers
running
windows
and

apps
for
the
blind
i
think
didnt
pay
much
attention
to
it
but
it
was
there
it
seems
that
a
particular
program
designed
for
blind
people
is
more
important
than
trying
to
interface
windows
with
a
way
for
blind
people
to
use
it
if
someone
made
a
voice
recognitionmultimedia
sound
oriented
program
it
would
probably
been
more
effective
i
dont
know
what
the
original
purpose
of
interfacing
windows
was
for
the
person
who
posted
the
