TCPIP
THROUGH
WINDOWS
I
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
COMPUTERS
SO
PLEASE
BEAR
WITH
ME
HERES
MY
QUESTION
CONTEXT
I
USE
A
PACKAGE
CALLED
SLIP
ON
MY
HOME
COMPUTER
TO
CONNECT
TO
THE
UNIVERSITY
MAINFRAME
AN
IBM
RUNNING
VMSMVS
AND
LOG
ON
TO
MY
ACCOUNT
WHEN
I
INSTALLED
SLIP
ON
MY
COMPUTER
I
HAD
TO
CONFIGURE
IT
FOR
MY
MODEM
KBS
ETRONICS
INTERNAL
AND
HAD
TO
SUPPLY
THE
PHONE
NUMBER
TO
DIAL
TO
REACH
THE
MAINFRAME
THE
WAY
IT
WORKS
NOW
IS
THAT
I
TYPE
TELNET
UICVM
OR
UICVM
EITHER
WILL
WORK
AT
THE
DOS
PROMPT
UICVM
IS
THE
NODE
NAME
OF
THE
MAINFRAME
THE
PROGRAM
THEN
DIALS
THE
MAINFRAME
ESTABLISHES
A
PROTOCOL
AND
GIVES
ME
THE
LOGON
SCREEN
TELNET
AND
ARE
THE
NAMES
OF
BATCH
FILES
IN
MY
SLIP
DIRECTORY
I
HAVE
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
A
KERMIT
PROTOCOL
IS
USED
FOR
THE
SESSION
PROBLEM
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
ALL
THIS
UNDER
WINDOWS
BECAUSE
I
HARDLY
EVER
USE
DOS
DIRECTLY
SLIP
WILL
NOT
RUN
UNDER
WINDOWS
I
TALKED
TO
THE
PEOPLE
AT
OUR
COMPUTER
CENTER
AND
THEY
SUGGESTED
THAT
I
USE
A
PACKET
DRIVER
CALLED
WINPKTCOM
WITH
SLIP
THEY
GAVE
ME
INSTRUCTIONS
ON
HOW
TO
LOAD
IT
BEFORE
I
START
WINDOWS
AND
HOW
TO
MODIFY
THE
TCPSTART
AND
TCPSTOP
BATCH
FILES
IN
THE
SLIP
DIRECTORY
TO
ENSURE
THAT
IT
WOULD
WORK
I
DID
ALL
THAT
AND
I
COULD
RUN
SLIP
FROM
WINDOWS
BUT
THERE
WERE
OTHER
PROBLEMS
FOR
ONE
THING
SLIP
WOULD
NOT
HANG
UP
THE
PHONE
WHEN
I
EXITED
I
HAD
TO
RUN
MY
COMMUNI
CATIONS
PROGRAM
TO
HANG
UP
THE
PHONE
OR
REBOOT
THE
COMPUTER
WHEN
THAT
DIDNT
WORK
FOR
ANOTHER
THERE
WERE
TOO
MANY
ERRORS
IT
OFTEN
TOOK
ME
TRIES
TO
CONNECT
TO
THE
MAINFRAME
OUR
COMPUTER
CENTER
DOES
NOT
SUPPORT
SLIP
UNDER
WINDOWS
SO
I
CANT
KEEP
GOING
BACK
TO
THEM
WITH
MORE
QUESTIONS
QUESTION
IS
THERE
SOME
OTHER
SHAREWARE
PACKAGE
THAT
WILL
RUN
UNDER
WINDOWS
AND
DO
WHAT
SLIP
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
I
NEED
A
PACKAGE
THAT
IS
NOT
TOO
EXPENSIVE
WHICH
IS
WHY
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
SHAREWARE
I
HAVE
HEARD
THAT
THERE
ARE
REGULAR
COMMERCIAL
PACKAGES
THAT
DO
ALL
THIS
BUT
THEY
COST
HUNDREDS
OF
DOLLARS
THESE
ARE
THE
MAIN
REQUIREMENTS
MUST
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
UNDER
WINDOWS
MUST
ALLOW
AND
IBM
TERMINAL
EMULATION
MUST
ALLOW
FTP
FILE
TRANSFERS
SINCE
THATS
THE
ONLY
KIND
THE
MAINFRAME
ALLOWS
NO
YMODEM
OR
ZMODEM
ETC
I
BELIEVE
THE
FTP
TRANSFERS
ARE
MADE
THROUGH
A
KERMIT
PROTOCOL
BUT
IM
HAZY
ABOUT
THAT
A
SUBSIDIARY
FEATURE
THAT
WOULD
BE
NICE
TO
HAVE
IF
ITS
A
TRUE
WINDOWS
PROGRAM
RATHER
THAN
A
DOS
PROGRAM
MODIFIED
TO
RUN
UNDER
WINDOWS
IS
THE
ABILITY
TO
RUN
THE
SESSION
IN
A
WINDOW
CONCURRENTLY
WITH
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
AND
TO
CUT
AND
PASTE
BETWEEN
THE
TELNET
SESSION
AND
OTHER
APPLICATIONS
ANY
INFORMATION
RECEIVED
IS
APPRECIATED
