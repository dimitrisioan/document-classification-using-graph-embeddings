OF

THAT

THE

YOU

THAT

THERE
SEEMS
TO

A
CONSPIRACY
OF

ABOUT
THIS

YOULL
GET
NO

AT

OF

I
SPOKE

NEVER

MANY
DIDNT

IF
YOU
CAN
UPGRADE

YOU

BECAUSE
THE

IN

CANNOT
GET

THIS

BY

IF

YOU
MAY
NOT
HAVE
A

AS
THE

PART
OF
THE

CAN
BE
DESIGNED
TO
BE
AWARE
OF
THE
STATE
OF
THE
UART
AND
AVOID
OVERRUNNING
IT
HOWEVER
I
WOULDNT
WANT
TO
BET
THAT
THE
CARD
DESIGNERS
WERE
THAT
CLEVER
AND
WILL
INSIST
ON
A
UART
IF
I
EVER
BUY
A

SOME

DONT

SUFFICIENTLY
RELIABLE

THAT

STILL
BE

IN

IF
THIS

YOUR

YOU
MAY
NEED
TO

THIS

COST
YOU
MORE

THE
STATE

AN
EMBARRASSMENT
ACROSS

BECAUSE
IT

THE
OLDEST
STANDARD
IO

THE

BE
ASSIGNED

SENIOR

LOWEST

ENGINEERS
AT

COMPANIES
THE
DESIGN
OF
THE

AT

TEN
YEARS
BEHIND
THE
STATE
OF
THE

IN

I
LOBBIED
FOR

THIS
