edition

this
article
applies
only
to
windows
and
and
not
to
nt
or
dos
apps
not
running
under
windows
one
of
the
unadvertised
limitations
of
most
current
windows
pcs
is
that
their
serial
com
performance
is
seriously
deficient
almost
everyone
who
purchases
a
highspeed
modem
pep
or
hst
discovers
the
problem
the
first
time
they
try
to
download
a
file
or
accept
an
incoming
fax
at
after
upgrading
the
modem
overrun
and
retry
errors
abound
even
when
the
only
active
application
is
the
datacomm
or
fax
program
if
the
transfer
completes
at
all
it
may
take
even
longer
than
with
the
old
modem
there
are
three
reasons
for
the
problem
the
universal
asynchronous
receivertransmitters
uarts
used
in
most
pcs
are
primitive
devices
with
singlebyte
fifo
buffers
if
the
operating
systemdriver
cannot
read
and
flush
each
character
at
high
interrupt
rates
the
next
incoming
character
overwrites
the
fifo
and
the
previous
one
is
lost
dos
being
a
fairly
singleminded
environment
during
datacomm
can
usually
keep
up
windows
cant
windows
has
more
operating
system
overhead
than
plain
dos
and
interrupts
often
take
longer
to
service
overruns
are
much
more
likely
than
under
dos
as
soon
as
you
report
to
your
pcmodem
vendor
that
you
are
losing
data
you
may
be
advised
that
you
need
to
upgrade
to
a
more
likely
since
there
seems
to
be
a
conspiracy
of
ignorance
about
this
issue
youll
get
no
useful
advice
at
all
most
of
the
storefront
and
mailorder
sources
i
spoke
with
in
attempting
to
solve
my
own
problem
had
never
heard
the
term
and
many
didnt
even
know
what
a
uart
was
even
your
pc
has
uarts
and
do
or
if
you
can
upgrade
your
mothercom
board
or
add
a
new
com
board
you
may
still
experience
errors
and
overruns
because
the
standard
microsoft
windows
com
drivers
dont
take
full
advantage
of
the
windows
is
improved
in
this
regard
over
but
i
still
recommend
a
driver
upgrade
applications
like
procommwin
which
is
what
i
use
cannot
get
around
this
problem
by
themselves
if
you
have
a
modem
card
you
may
not
have
a
problem
as
the
modem
part
of
the
card
can
be
designed
to
be
aware
of
the
state
of
the
uart
and
avoid
overrunning
it
however
i
wouldnt
want
to
bet
that
the
card
designers
were
that
clever
and
will
insist
on
a
uart
if
i
ever
buy
a
modem
card
some
modem
cards
dont
even
have
conventional
uarts
but
if
they
are
to
work
with
standard
windows
drivers
they
need
to
simulate
one
use
msdexe
below
to
see
what
the
modem
card
is
or
is
pretending
to
be
the
hardware
situation
the
uarts
on
most
pc
com
ports
are
based
on
national
semiconductor
or
chips
or
megacells
inside
vlsi
chips
where
you
cant
replace
them
you
can
id
the
uart
type
on
your
system
by
running
the
microsoft
diagnostic
program
windowsmsdexe
be
sure
to
run
it
in
dos
before
bringing
up
windows
the
windows
serial
api
may
prevent
msd
from
accurately
identifying
a
if
you
run
it
from
a
windows
dos
prompt
the
uart
has
separate
transmit
and
receive
fifos
with
configurable
trigger
levels
and
can
run
reliably
at
clock
rates
up
to
bps
although
with
current
modem
technology
theres
no
point
in
pushing
your
luck
by
going
over
bps
the
has
shorted
access
cycle
times
than
the
or
the
also
has
dma
capability
but
it
is
not
clear
that
any
pc
drivers
ever
use
this
for
more
technical
info
see
national
semiconductor
application
note
so
what
uart
component
do
you
have
try
to
locate
the
uart
on
your
mother
board
multifunction
io
card
com
board
or
isamca
modem
card
if
you
cant
find
a
socketed
component
with
the
numbers
or
your
com
ports
are
probably
buried
in
vlsi
and
you
wont
be
able
to
perform
a
chip
replacement
if
you
can
disable
your
vlsi
com
ports
as
i
chose
to
do
you
can
at
least
add
an
aftermarket
com
board
if
you
have
one
or
more
socketed
or
chips
you
can
buy
plugin
or
low
power
cmos
version
ics
from
several
suppliers
typically
for
to
each
the
n
chip
is
the
normal
dualinline
package
other
styles
are
available
but
avoid
any
chips
without
the

the
are
presumably
all
ok
early
ns
chips
have
bugs
although
national
will
reportedly
exchange
those
of
their
own
manufacture
for
free
clone
chips
are
available
from
various
ic
makers
other
than
national
the
manual
for
the
turbocom

states
support
for
the
following
apparently
equivalent

turbocom
warns
about
the

and
western

says
that
problems
have
been
reported
with
early
ibm
and
systems
ibm
reportedly
will
upgrade
them
if
you
dont
have
socketed
chips
youll
need
to
buy
an
after
market
com
or
multifunction
board
if
this
is
a
modem
card
situation
you
may
be
hosed
to
add
a
new
com
or
multifunction
card
youll
need
to
either
disable
the
ports
you
are
replacing
or
reassign
them
to
although
watch
out
for
irq
conflicts
without
turbocom
although
cheaper
cards
are
available
in
the
interest
of
getting
the
problem
solved
quickly

meanwhile
back
at
the
mct
card
from
jdr
i
only
needed
two
serial
ports
and
am
running
out
of
irqs
on
my
pc
so
i
disabled
my
builtin
vlsibased
ports
however
with
the
turbocom
driver
below
i
could
have
set
the
internals
as
and
using
irq
sharing
the
software
situation
simply
upgrading
to
uarts
will
not
completely
solve
common
overrun
problems
the
standard
ms
serial
drivers
dont
take
full
advantage
of
the
the
windows
drivers
are
even
less
capable
and
the
windows
drivers
have
the
following
limitations
they
enable
only
the
receive
fifo
and
only
at
rates
above
bps
they
never
enable
the
transmit
fifo
which
results
in
an
interrupt
rate
of
during
uploads
they
set
the
trigger
level
at
bytes
too
high
its
easy
for
more
bytes
to
arrive
before
the
driver
can
read
the
fifo
the
ports
menu
of
the
control
panel
only
allows
speeds
up
to
with
a
modem
sparse
data
and
text
can
easily
compress
or
more
suggesting
that
a
host
dte
connect
rate
of
bps
would
be
effective
the
api
wont
accept
rates
above
the
api
wont
let
dos
programs
know
there
is
a
there
and
even
if
it
did
dos
programs
that
arent
get
little
benefit
from
a
port
with
the
standard
drivers
they
dont
allow
irq
sharing
for
the
bios
doesnt
initialize
properly
in
many
systems
windows
provides
no
workaround
for
apps
that
dont
provide
port
speed
options
above
bps
these
problems
are
reportedly
not
solved
in
windows
nt
or
dos
and
may
or
may
not
be
addressed
in
any
windows
releases
after
but
before
rumors
suggest
they
may
be
solved
in
windows
you
can
get
replacement
drivers
that
solve
all
of
those
problems
by
buying
a
copy
of
turbocom
current
version
from
bioengineering
research
pacific
commware
division
beacon
hill
lane
ashland
or
voice
fax
bbs
mcimail
compuserve
price
was
around
as
i
recall
bioeng
is
not
set
up
to
accept
credit
cards
so
i
had
to
send
a
check
egghead
and
list
turbocom
but
as
far
as
i
know
they
dont
stock
it
bio
is
not
a
software
company
per
se
they
apparently
needed
reliable
hispeed
serial
connections
for
an
inhouse
instrument
application
wrote
their
own
driver
discovered
a
market
for
it
revised
it
to
be
a
general
purpose
com
driver
suite
they
recently
upgraded
it
for
windows
it
is
runtime
licensed
i
now
have
my
host
dte
connect
rate
set
to
bps
most
of
my
datacomm
apps
and
i
am
having
zero
problems
with
downloads
i
routinely
see
transfer
rates
that
exceed
bps
i
am
also
using
bps
when
linking
an
to
my
pc
with
lossless
bidirectional
io
uploads
to
various
remote
systems
are
another
matter
because
many
hosts
are
still
using
antique
uarts
and
drivers
note
that
is
still
the
highest
rate
that
the
windows
port
menu
in
control
panel
will
allow
in
configuring
a
com
port
turbocom
gets
around
this
by
allowing
you
to
specify
on
each
port
a
factor
that
will
set
the
real
uart
rate
to
a
multiple
of
the
rate
passed
through
the
windows
apis
and
dialog
boxes
i
also
have
ctsrts
hardware
flow
control
enabled
and
i
suggest
that
you
do
the
same
even
if
you
only
ever
transfer
ascii
data
xonxoff
is
not
a
sufficiently
reliable
method
of
flow
control
the
informal
dec
standard
for
xonxoff
hysteresis
is
that
the
sender
may
transmit
another
yes
sixteen
bytes
after
receipt
of
the
xoff
from
the
receiving
system
or
device
the
byte
fifo
in
the
is
clearly
not
big
enough
to
let
us
rely
exclusively
on
xonxoff
a
wellrespected
datacomm
engineer
has
informed
me
that
the
cant
really
do
ctsrts
all
by
itself
in
the
doswindows
environment
so
using
data
rates
above
may
still
be
risky
even
with
hardware
flow
control
a
with
turbocom
can
still
experience
overruns
in
very
busy
systems
with
lots
of
apps
running
and
serious
swapping
in
progress
if
this
is
your
situation
you
may
need
to
buy
a
coprocessed
com
board
but
this
will
cost
you
more
than
a
upgrade
a
review
of
two
such
boards
and
a
review
of
turbocom
can
be
found
in
the
issue
of
windows
sources
magazine
i
suggest
trying
a
upgrade
first
and
experiment
with
process
priorities
and
time
slices
if
you
are
a
power
user
whose
thrashing
system
still
runs
into
comm
problems
closing
soapbox
comments
the
state
of
serial
datacomm
support
is
an
embarrassment
across
the
computer
industry
because
it
is
the
oldest
standard
io
interface
the
job
of
designing
hardware
and
writing
software
often
seems
to
be
assigned
to
the
least
senior
or
lowest
ranked
engineers
at
computer
companies
the
design
of
the
average
serial
port
is
at
least
ten
years
behind
the
state
of
the
art
in
my
last
job
with
a
major
workstation
vendor
i
lobbied
for
improved
serial
ports
when
they
were
doing
the
initial
designs
of
a
new
system
that
family
of
machines
was
subsequently
introduced
with
ports
however
this
is
the
exception
few
computer
companies
seem
to
have
any
champions
for
decent
io
you
may
as
well
learn
what
you
can
about
serial
io
because
this
situation
shows
no
sign
of
improving
soon
when
vfast
arrives
i
expect
cries
of
outrage
from
windows
users
worldwide
whose
pcs
sort
of
work
today
with
but
will
fail
miserably
with
vfast
without
a
hardwarebuffered
uart
like
the
and
without
software
drivers
that
use
that
uart
to
best
advantage
a
vfast
modem
will
be
a
waste
of
money
