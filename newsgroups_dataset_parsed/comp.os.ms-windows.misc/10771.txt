WRITES
LET
ME
POSE
A
QUESTION
HOW
MANY
MSDOS
USERS
ARE
OUT
THERE
WHO
HAVE
NO
ACCESS
TO
THE
NET
BUT
WOULD
PROBABLY
FIND
THIS
FEATURE
USEFUL
TOO
IE
YOUR
SUGGESTION
IMPLIES
THAT
MICROSOFT
IS
RELYING
ON
THE
SHAREWARE
OR
PD
PRODUCTS
TO
FILL
THE
GAPS
ON
DOS
OR
DID
I
MISUNDERSTAND
YOUR
STATEMENT
SHAREWARE
IS
AVAILABLE
FROM
THE
NET
MAGAZINES
DISTRIBUTORS
CLUBS
FRIENDS
AND
BULLETIN
BOARDS
I
DONT
THINK
PEOPLE
HAVE
ANY
PROBLEMS
GETTING
HOLD
OF
IT
FILL
GAPS
IN
DOS
THERES
NO
NEED
FOR
MANY
PEOPLE
DOS
PROVIDES
MORE
SERVICES
THAN
I
NEED
AS
IT
IS
I
JUST
RUN
WINDOWS
ON
TOP
OF
IT
BTW
MY
WINDOWS
MUST
BE
AN
OPERATING
SYSTEM
IT
PROVIDES
A
DISK
OPERATING
SYSTEM
THAT
DOS
CANT
ACCESS
NFS
