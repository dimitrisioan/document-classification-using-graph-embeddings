hello
im
investigating
the
purchase
of
an
object
oriented
application
framework
i
have
come
across
a
few
that
look
good
zapp
from
inmark
zinc
from
zinc
software
cviews
from
liant
win
from
blaise
some
considerations
im
using
being
new
to
windows
programming
im
from
the
unixx
world
the
quality
and
intuitivness
of
the
abstraction
that
these
class
libraries
provide
is
very
important
however
since
im
not
adverse
to
learning
the
internals
of
windows
programming
the
new
programming
methodology
should
be
closely
aligned
with
the
native
one
i
dont
believe
arbitrary
levels
of
abstraction
just
for
the
sake
of
changing
the
api
are
valuable
the
microsoft
founation
classes
afx
that
come
with
cc
and
visual
c
are
very
good
they
already
have
a
version
for
nt
it
comes
with
source
code
and
is
very
close
to
the
navtive
api
it
also
as
some
classes
to
manage
data
structures
