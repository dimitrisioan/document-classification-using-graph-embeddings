SUPPORTERS

GRIER
WRITES
I
THINK
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
POSTING
ARE
FORGETTING
THAT
MOST
USERS
OF
MS
PRODUCTS
DO
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
ABOUT
INTERNET
AND
UNIX
IS
THAT
VERY
UNFRIENDLY
PLACE
WHERE
BIZZARE
ABREVIATIONS
REPLACE
THE
RATHER
COMFORTABLE
ABREVIATIONS
THEY
KNOW
AND
THE
ABREVIATIONS
HAVE
SUBTLE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
DIFFERENT
VENDORS
WHILE
PC
USERS
TEND
TO
CUSTOMIZE
ANY
WINDOWING
SETUP
THEY
CAN
NOT
DO
MUCH
WITH
THEIR
COMMAND
LINE
YOU
CANT
CUSTOMIZE
A
COMMAND
LINE
INTERFACE
WHERE
HAVE
YOU
BEEN
I
CAN
CHANGE
THE
PROMPT
I
CAN
MAKE
ALIASES
SO
SOMEONE
LIKE
ME
WHO
IS
USED
TO
SAY
LS
CAN
TYPE
IT
ON
MY
DOS
MACHINE
AND
STILL
GET
A
DIRECTORY
LISTING
AND
UNDER
UNIX
IF
I
DONT
LIKE
THE
COMMAND
LINE
INTERFACE
I
THROW
IT
OUT
AND
GET
A
DIFFERENT
ONE
CSH
BASH
KSH
SH
ETC
SO
TO
MOST
OF
THE
COMPUTER
USERS
IN
THE
WORLD
MS
PRODUCT
SYMBOLIZE
QUALITY
MS
HAS
MADE
THEIR
LIFE
EASIER
AND
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
AND
TO
THEM
THAT
IS
QUALITY
THEY
DO
NOT
CARE
ABOUT
WHAT
INNOVATIVE
THINGS
MS
HAS
DONE
OTHER
THAN
TO
MAKE
THEIR
LIFE
WITH
A
COMPUTER
ONE
HECK
OF
A
LOT
EASIER
YOU
MAY
KNOW
BETTER
THAN
MOST
COMPUTER
USERS
IN
THIS
WORLD
BUT
THAT
WILL
NOT
CHANGE
THEIR
PERCEPTION
THIS
IS
TRUE
FACE
IT
UNTIL
UNIX
COME
UP
WITH
A
DECENT
GUI
THAT
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
ALL
VARIATIONS
OF
UNIX
IT
JUST
WILL
NOT
CATCH
ON
WITH
THE
MAINSTREAM
OF
COMPUTER
USERS
WE
HERE
ON
THE
NET
ARE
NOT
MAINSTREAM
COMPUTER
USERS
A
DECENT
GUI
FOR
ALL
VARIATIONS
OF
UNIX
LESSEE
WHAT
ABOUT
MOTIF
OR
THE
STUFF
FROM
MIT
TWM
COMES
TO
MIND
THOSE
ARE
PRETTY
STANDARD
HECK
AN
XWINDOWS
PROGRAM
RUNS
LIKE
IT
LIKES
TO
ALL
THE
END
USER
HAS
TO
REALLY
KNOW
IS
HOW
TO
MANIPULATE
THE
ACTUAL
WINDOWS
WITH
THE
MOUSE
AND
SINCE
IT
IS
A
GUI
ITS
GRAPHICAL
AND
A
BIT
EASIER
TO
FIGURE
OUT
SOMETHING
THE
WINDOWS
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
PRESSING
DOWN
OUR
THROATS
FOR
SOME
TIME
NOW
THE
THING
I
FEAR
IS
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
A
GAP
BETWEEN
THE
NORMAL
USERS
RUNNING
WINDOWS
ALL
FLAVORS
AND
THE
OTHER
POWER
USERS
RUNNING
UNIX
AND
OTHER
MORE
ADVANCED
OSES
AT
LEAST
RIGHT
NOW
DOS
IS
STILL
PRETTY
MUCH
KING
I
CAN
BRING
A
COPY
OF
MY
LATEST
WHIZBANG
PROGRAMMING
DEMO
OVER
TO
MY
FRIENDS
HOUSE
AND
SINCE
WE
BOTH
RUN
DOS
HE
CAN
ENJOY
IT
TOO
