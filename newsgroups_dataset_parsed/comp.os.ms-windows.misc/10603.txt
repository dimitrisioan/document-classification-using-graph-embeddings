introduction
cosypak
is
set
of
packages
and
notebooks
for
classical
control
and
some
modern
state

control
analysis
and

the
notebooks
in
cosypak
follow
a
typical

course
taught
at
many
universities
around
the
world
for
the
juniorsenior
level
undergraduates
there
is
no
fee
to
use
cosypak

changes
in
version
update
from
to
in
this
version
we
have
revised
cosypak
to
take
advantage
of
the
more
robust
signal
processing
functions
available
in
mathematica
since
mathematica
provides
a
better
and
working
laplacetransform
and
inverselaplacetransform
functions
than
mathematica
did
we
adopted
them
this
has
made
cosypak
smaller
thus
brian
evans
signal
processing
packages
that
supported
the
laplacetransform
and
inverselaplacetransform
functions
in
the
cosypak
are
no
longer
needed
directly
by
cosypak
for
power
users
who
use
signal
processing
we
still
recommend
the
use
of
the
very
fine
brian
evans
package
on
signal
processing
available
at
the
anonymous
ftp
site
gausseedspgatechedu
or
ip
on
the
downside
the
disadvantage
of
this
update
can
be
that
mathematica
requires
more
runtime
resources
than
its
previous
version
for
mathematica
users
we
have
included
the
laplacetransform
package
from
mathematica
in
the
directory
please
move
all
files
and
directory
under
into
the

introduction
this
is
an
unsupported
release
of
cosypak
a
control
systems
analysis
package
for
symbolic
control
systems
analysis
using
mathematica
classical
control
systems
analysis
and
design
methods
and
some
modern
control
systems
methods
have
been
implemented
in
this
package
this
package
and
the
attendant
notebooks
were
developed
on
a
next
tm
computer
a
unix
based
workstation
they
have
been
used
as
a
supplementary
teaching
aid
along
with
standard
control
engineering
texts
ogata
phillips
and
harbor
for
undergraduate
courses
in
control
engineering
i
taught
at
the
systems
engineering
department
of
cwru
in
addition
to
the
next
they
have
also
been
tested
successfully
on
apple
macintosh
computers
tm
and
ibm
pcs
tm
running
ms
windowstm
we
would
be
very
much
interested
to
hear
from
you
if
you
or
anybody
you
know
uses
this
software
on
platforms
not
mentioned
above
ibm
users
however
will
have
to
evaluate
the
notebooks
first
to

once
installed
see

this
collection
of
mathematica
packages
can
be
loaded
by
any
user
bundled
with
the
packages
are
many
notebooks

which
demonstrate
the
functionality
of
these

the
