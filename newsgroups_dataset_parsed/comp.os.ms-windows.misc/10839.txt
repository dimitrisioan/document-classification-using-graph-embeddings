IS
SUPPOSED
TO
READ
AND
WRITE
MAC
DISKS
IVE
NEVER
TRIED
IT
THOUGH
GOOD
LUCK
I
JUST
TRIED
IT
BUT
I
CANT
SAY
THAT
IT
WORKS
CAUSE
IT
DOESNT
READ
DISKS
IT
ONLY
READS
IF
THERE
A
PROGRAM
THAT
DOES
READ
DISKS
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
WELL
YOU
CANT
SAY
THAT
IT
DONT
WORK
THE
INABILITY
TO
READ
MAC
DISKS
IS
NOT
A
SW
PROBLEM
RATHER
ITS
A
HARDWARE
LIMMITATION
ON
PCS
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
POST
ABOUT
A
PROGRAM
ABLE
TO
READ
MAC
DISKS
WHICH
COMES
WITH
A
WATCHAMACALIT
MA
MEMORYS
FALING
CARD
WHICH
YOU
JUST
DROP
INTO
A
COM
PORT
OR
SOMETHING
DONT
REMEMBER
SPECIFICS
THO
PEACE
MICKEY
ON
ALL
DRIVES
BOTH
MAC
AND
PC
THE
DISK
SPINS
AT
A
CONSTANT
RPM
ON
MAC
DISK
DRIVES
THE
SPIN
RATE
OF
THE
DISK
IS
VARIED
SO
THAT
THE
TRACKS
PASS
UNDER
THE
HEAD
AT
A
CONSTANT
SPEED
A
SLOWER
ROTATION
FOR
THE
OUTER
TRACKS
AND
A
FASTER
ROTATION
FOR
THE
INNER
TRACKS
A
PC
NEEDS
SPECIAL
CONTROLLER
HARDWARE
TO
MAKE
THIS
HAPPEN
