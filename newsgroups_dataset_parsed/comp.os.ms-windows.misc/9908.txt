has
anyone
experienced
a
faint
shadow
at
all
resolutions
using
this
card
is
only
in
windows
i
have
replaced
card
and
am
waiting
on
latest
drivers
also
have
experienced
general
protection
fault
errors
in
wspdpsfdrv
on
winword
tools
option
menu
and
in
winfax
setup
i
had
a
ati
ultra
but
was
getting
genral
protection
fault
errors
in
an
spss
application
these
card
manufactures
must
have
terrible
quality
control
to
let
products
on
the
market
with
so
many
bugs
what
a
hassle
running
on
gateway
thx
dave
l
youre
using
drivers
version
or
earlier
the
latest
is
available
from
their
bbs
or
by
snailmail
it
at
least
fixes
the
wfw
problem
the
reason
i
wanted
to
reply
in
public
instead
of
private
mail
is
because
of
following
i
talked
to
their
tech
support
a
few
days
ago
and
was
told
that
i
can
expect
a
new
version
near
the
end
of
the
month
which
should
be
about
now
however
i
have
a
problem
when
switching
back
from
a
dos
session
in
standard
mode
apparently
they
dont
know
of
this
problem
and
seem
to
be
surprised
why
anybody
would
want
to
use
standard
mode
at
all
its
a
great
card
for
the
price
at
least
when
i
bought
it
now
there
may
be
better
alternatives
