mirosoft
office
package
i
am
in
charge
of
purchasing
some
computer
software
for
a
small
office
and
i
have
a
few
question
about
microsofts
office
pack
i
was
wondering
are
the
programs
that
are
packaged
with
the
office
packwinword
power
point
excel
and
ccmailcomplete
and
the
latest
addition
are
the
programs
hobbled
in
any
way
can
we
update
single
programs
at
a
latter
date
ie
from
excel
to
excel
do
you
receive
all
of
the
necessary
disks
and
documentation
is
there
anything
that
i
should
be
aware
of
that
makes
the
office
package
less
of
deal
that
it
seems
sorry
if
i
seem
skeptical
put
the
price
for
the
office
on
the
streetsounds
like
a
great
deal
for
the
office
that
is
purchasing
its
first
computer
and
software
but
all
four
complete
programs
for
less
than
makes
me
just
a
little
suspicious
maybe
its
just
me
thanks
for
your
help
in
advance
