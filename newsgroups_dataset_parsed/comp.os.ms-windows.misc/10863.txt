im
an
amiga
user
by
day
i
work
with
windows
id
be
much
more
comfortable
in
windows
if
i
had
two
things
a
good
personal
information
manager
you
know
a
calendar
address
book
reminder
list
etc
rolled
into
one
clean
interface
lotus
organizer
quick
cheap
pretty
and
has
all
of
those
features
you
want
a
good
file
manager
microsofts
is
very
poor
by
my
standards
you
might
look
at
one
of
the
shell
alternatives
provided
by
third
parties
norton
desktop
for
windows
for
instance
personally
i
like
file
manager
which
comes
with
windows
its
much
faster
than
ndws
and
the
file
manager
thats
part
of
windows
for
workgroups
even
has
a
decent
button
bar
how
about
one
that
has
a
left
and
right
window
and
allows
file
operations
between
them
being
able
to
launch
programs
from
the
same
interface
would
be
nice
as
well
as
text
reading
and
graphics
viewing
those
who
are
familiar
with
directory
opus
on
the
amiga
know
what
im
looking
for
that
first
you
can
do
with
file
manager
but
the
others
youll
need
to
look
at
ndw
or
pc
tools
for
windows
etc
if
anyone
can
steer
me
towards
an
ftp
sight
with
these
programs
it
would
make
my
transition
to
windows
a
lot
easier
please
reply
via
email
as
i
rarely
get
to
read
this
group
thanks
so
much
i
havent
yet
seen
a
decent
freeware
or
even
shareware
shell
but
it
may
be
just
me

the
absurd
is
the
essential
