GIVES
YOU
A

UTILITIES
THERE
ARE
OTHER
SIMILAR
SYSTEMS
FROM
OTHER
VENDORS
AS
WELL
THE
EMX
SYSTEM
FOR
GIVES
YOU
MOST
OF
THE
STANDARD
UNIX
SYSTEM
CALLS
FOR
RECOMPILING
YOUR
UNIX
PROGRAMS
UNDER
NOT
QUITE
THE
SAME
THING
AS
ACTUALLY
RUNNING
UNIX
PROGRAMS
DIRECTLY
IN
EITHER
CASE
BUT
EMX
MAKES
ALMOST
AS
COMPATIBLE
WITH
UNIX
SYSTEMS
AS
MANY
UNIX
SYSTEMS
ARE
WITH
EACH
OTHER
AND
BEST
OF
ALL
EMX
IS
FREE
THERE
IS
A
SIMILAR
SYSTEM
FOR
DOS
BUT
IT
DOESNT
WORK
WITH
WINDOWS
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
PRICE
A
GOOD

AVALIABLE

TOO
SHOULD
ADD
IN
THE
COST
FOR

WITH
BOTH
GEOS

WINDOWS
NEITHER
OF
WHICH
IS
A
STANDALONE
OS
AT
THIS

NEITHER
NOR
UNIX
REQUIRES
DOS
BTW
TWO
OF
THE
BEST
UNICES
IVE
SEEN
FOR

CEE
ARE

FOR
THE

AND
LINUX
FREE
SO
I
DONT
AGREE
THAT
A
GOOD
ONE
COSTS
AND
IF
