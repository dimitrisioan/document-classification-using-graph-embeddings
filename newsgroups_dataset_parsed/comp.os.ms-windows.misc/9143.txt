writes
with
my
limited
knowladge
about
the
pc
geos
i
came
out
with
following
comparison
pc
geos
windows
can
run
win
programs
nop
yap
yap
nop
novell
is
at
least
demoing
windows
apps
running
under
unixware
can
run
unix
nop
i
have
not
nop
yap
heard
of
it
try
mks
mks
others
esp
emx
note
here
the
mks
toolkit
for
doswindows
gives
you
a
good
suite
of
standard
unix
utilities
there
are
other
similar
systems
from
other
vendors
as
well
the
emx
system
for
gives
you
most
of
the
standard
unix
system
calls
for
recompiling
your
unix
programs
under
not
quite
the
same
thing
as
actually
running
unix
programs
directly
in
either
case
but
emx
makes
almost
as
compatible
with
unix
systems
as
many
unix
systems
are
with
each
other
and
best
of
all
emx
is
free
there
is
a
similar
system
for
dos
but
it
doesnt
work
with
windows
as
far
as
i
know
price
a
good
one
costs
avaliable
on
ext
card
too
should
add
in
the
cost
for
dos
with
both
geos
and
windows
neither
of
which
is
a
standalone
os
at
this
point
neither
nor
unix
requires
dos
btw
two
of
the
best
unices
ive
seen
for
the
pee
cee
are
unixware
for
the
personal
edition
and
linux
free
so
i
dont
agree
that
a
good
one
costs
and
if
you
really
want
to
check
out
the
various
options
available
to
you
you
should
also
look
into
desqview
and
desqviewx
