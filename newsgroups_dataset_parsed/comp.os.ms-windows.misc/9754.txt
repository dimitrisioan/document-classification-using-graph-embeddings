WINDOWS
AND
MULTIPLE
MONITORS
APART
HI
I
AM
WORKING
ON
GATHERING
DATA
ON
THE
WAY
THAT
USERS
USE
COMPUTERS
THIS
INVOLVES
GETTING
SUBJECTS
TO
TYPE
AND
USE
A
MOUSE
I
WANT
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
WATCH
WHAT
THEY
ARE
DOING
WITHOUT
BEING
IN
THE
SAME
ROOM
IT
WOULD
BE
IDEAL
IF
I
COULD
WATCH
THE
SESSION
ON
ANOTHER
MONITOR
WITHOUT
THE
SUBJECTS
KNOWLEDGE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
SPLITING
THE
MONITOR
CABLE
WILL
ONLY
WORK
FOR
SHORT
DISTANCES
IE
I
WILL
NEED
TO
BE
APPROX
AWAY
AS
THE
CABLE
TRAVELS
THE
PCS
ARE
CONNECTED
TO
A
TCPIP
NETWORK
AND
RUN
WINDOWS
IS
THERE
ANY
SOFTWARE
THAT
WILL
ALLOW
ME
TO
WATCH
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
ON
ANOTHER
PC
THANKS
