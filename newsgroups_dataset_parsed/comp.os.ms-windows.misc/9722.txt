unless
i
am
completely
misunderstanding
you
try
using
either
notepad
or
syseditexe
found
in
your
system
subdirectory
to
edit
you
ini
files
you
can
add
sysedit
regedit
to
a
program
group
they
are
windows
programs
the
syseditexe
program
is
cool
because
it
automatically
opens
you
winini
systemini
autoexecbat
and
configsys
files
to
be
edited
is
it
possible
to
get
it
to
load
other
ini
files
no
when
the
program
is
run
it
loads
configuration
files
autoexecbat
configsys
winini
and
systemini
there
is
no
open
entry
on
the
file
menu
you
can
only
edit
these
four
files
if
you
need
to
edit
some
other
programs
ini
file
use
notepad
or
some
other
ascii
editor
i
wonder
whether
microsoft
intended
for
sysedit
to
be
used
or
if
it
was
just
a
holdover
from
the
testing
period
and
they
forgot
to
take
it
out
the
reason
i
think
this
is
because
there
is
absolutely
no
mention
in
the
manuals
about
this
program
and
there
is
no
online
help
for
it
just
an
about
entry
under
the
file
menu
the
program
looks
like
something
that
was
intended
for
internal
use
only
its
kind
of
a
shame
though
it
would
have
made
a
nice
multifile
replacement
for
notepad
