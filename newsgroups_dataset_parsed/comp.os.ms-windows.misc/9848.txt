i
have
a
microsoft
serial
mouse
and
am
using
mousecom
was
using
i
think
but
switched
to
to
see
if
it
was
any
better
vertical
motion
is
nice
and
smooth
but
horizontal
motion
is
so
bad
i
sometimes
cant
click
on
something
because
my
mouse
jumps
around
i
can
be
moving
the
mouse
to
the
right
with
relatively
uniform
motion
and
the
mouse
will
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
to
the
right
then
move
smoothly
for
a
bit
then
jump
again
maybe
this
time
to
the
left
about
inch
this
is
crazy
i
have
never
had
so
much
trouble
with
a
mouse
before
anyone
have
any
solutions
does
microsoft
think
they
are
what
everyone
should
be
just
venting
steam
i
had
the
same
problem
at
first
i
thought
it
was
the
video
driver
and
made
sure
i
had
the
most
current
drivers
because
the
problem
was
most
evident
at
svga
resolution
modes
it
didnt
help
and
after
a
bit
of
experimentation
determined
that
the
problem
existed
in
standard
vga
resolution
mode
it
was
just
much
less
noticeable
my
mouse
was
an
older
ms
serial
version
i
bought
second
hand
in
it
worked
just
fine
in
dos
and
dos
based
graphic
applications
on
the
guess
that
the
problem
was
with
the
resolution
of
the
mouse
i
borrowed
a
new
mouse
a
ms
bus
model
and
tried
it
that
solved
the
problem
so
if
your
mouse
is
old
you
may
want
to
try
replacing
it
for
a
newer
one
