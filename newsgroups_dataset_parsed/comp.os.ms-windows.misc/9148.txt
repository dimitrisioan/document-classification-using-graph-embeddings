hi
there
theres
one
thing
about
windows
that
really
frosts
me
i
have
of
ram
installed
in
my
system
i
use
a
under
windows
diskcache
and
a
permanent
swap
file
while
i
can
never
fill
the
memory
up
i
still
have
problems
sometimes
because
i
run
out
of
gdi
resources
what
gives
i
think
windows
could
manage
these
resources
a
little
better
does
anyone
have
any
input
on
how
to
conserve
these
resources
so
that
i
can
avoid
this
problem

hundreds
if
not
thousands
of

nathan
has
a
fixed
limit
of
gdi
memory
regardless
of
physical
ram
installed
this
is
twice
that
of
but
not
nearly
robust
enough
for
many
developers
and
power
users
using
amish
launch
as
your
shell
you
can
reduce
gdi
memory
usage
by
as
much
as
over
progman
ndw
dashboard
and
other
graphical
type
icon
based
and
other
shells
also
nesting
and
full
hotkey
global
support
is
offered
something
no
other
shells
have
at
this
time
