HI
THERE
THERES
ONE
THING
ABOUT
WINDOWS
THAT
REALLY
FROSTS
ME
I
HAVE
OF
RAM
INSTALLED
IN
MY
SYSTEM
I
USE
A
UNDER
WINDOWS
DISKCACHE
AND
A
PERMANENT
SWAP
FILE
WHILE
I
CAN
NEVER
FILL
THE
MEMORY
UP
I
STILL
HAVE
PROBLEMS
SOMETIMES
BECAUSE
I
RUN
OUT
OF
GDI
RESOURCES
WHAT
GIVES
I
THINK
WINDOWS
COULD
MANAGE
THESE
RESOURCES
A
LITTLE
BETTER
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
INPUT
ON
HOW
TO
CONSERVE
THESE
RESOURCES
SO
THAT
I
CAN
AVOID
THIS
PROBLEM
