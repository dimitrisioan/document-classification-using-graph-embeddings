RE
STANDARD
AND
ENHANCED
QUESTION
MARTIN
LINSENBIGLER
WRITES
WHY
IS
WIN
SOMETIMES
SO
FINICKY
I
HAVE
A
NEW
DELL
MEGS
RAM
WINDOWS
WAS
WORKING
JUST
GREAT
I
HAD
A
BUS
MOUSE
AND
MOTHER
BOARD
PROBLEM
DELL
REPLACED
THE
MOUSE
GAVE
ME
A
NEWER
MOUSE
DRIVER
FOR
WINDOWS
AND
REPLACED
THE
MOTHERBOARD
JUST
PRIOR
TO
THIS
PROBLEM
WINDOWS
WOULD
ONLY
LOAD
UP
EVERY
OTHER
TIME
I
WOULD
GET
THE
LOGO
AND
EITHER
IT
WOULD
GO
ON
INTO
WINDOWS
OR
LOCK
UP
THIS
WAS
VERY
CONSISTENT
EVERY
OTHER
TIME
MUCH
DELETED
ANY
THOUGHTS
OR
COMMENTS
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
MEMORY
CONFLICT
PROBLEM
WHICH
CAN
CAUSE
TRULY
WEIRD
SYMPTOMS
LIKE
THESE
CALL
DELL
TECH
SUPPORT
OR
BETTER
POST
TO
THEM
ON
CSERVE
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
ACCOUNT
AND
GET
THE
MEMORY
RANGES
USED
BY
VIDEO
RAM
ON
YOUR
MACHINE
THE
BLOCK
WINDOWS
FROM
USING
THOSE
RANGES
WITH
AN
EMMEXCLUDE
STATEMENT
IN
THE
SECTION
OF
SYSTEMINI
YOU
PROBABLY
SHOULD
INCLUDE
A
STATEMENT
EXCLUDING
THE
SAME
RANGE
FROM
OR
WHATEVER
MEMORY
MANAGER
YOU
USE
IN
CONFIGSYS
DELL
INSTALLS
WINDOWS
ON
THE
MACHINES
THEY
SHIP
BUT
THE
INSTALLATION
DOESNT
CONSIST
OF
MUCH
MORE
THAN
COPYING
THE
FILES
TO
A
HARD
DISK
YOU
STILL
HAVE
TO
DO
THE
WORK
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
HAVE
THE
PROBLEM
IN
ENHANCED
MODE
BUT
NOT
STANDARD
STRONGLY
SUGGESTS
A
HIGH
MEMORY
CONFLICT
