GUI
APPLICATION
FRAMEWORKS
FOR
WINDOWS
HELLO
IM
INVESTIGATING
THE
PURCHASE
OF
AN
OBJECT
ORIENTED
APPLICATION
FRAMEWORK
I
HAVE
COME
ACROSS
A
FEW
THAT
LOOK
GOOD
ZAPP
FROM
INMARK
ZINC
FROM
ZINC
SOFTWARE
CVIEWS
FROM
LIANT
WIN
FROM
BLAISE
SOME
CONSIDERATIONS
IM
USING
BEING
NEW
TO
WINDOWS
PROGRAMMING
IM
FROM
THE
UNIXX
WORLD
THE
QUALITY
AND
INTUITIVNESS
OF
THE
ABSTRACTION
THAT
THESE
CLASS
LIBRARIES
PROVIDE
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
HOWEVER
SINCE
IM
NOT
ADVERSE
TO
LEARNING
THE
INTERNALS
OF
WINDOWS
PROGRAMMING
THE
NEW
PROGRAMMING
METHODOLOGY
SHOULD
BE
CLOSELY
ALIGNED
WITH
THE
NATIVE
ONE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ARBITRARY
LEVELS
OF
ABSTRACTION
JUST
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
CHANGING
THE
API
ARE
VALUABLE
SINCE
WE
WILL
BE
DEVELOPING
FOR
THE
WINDOWS
NT
SYSTEM
THE
MEMORY
MANAGEMENT
ISSUES
AND
ISSUES
PARTICULAR
TO
THE
WINDOWS
API
ARE
LESS
IMPORTANT
WE
WILL
PROBABLY
BUY
ANOTHER
C
CLASS
LIBRARY
SOMETHING
LIKE
TOOLSH
OR
BOOCH
COMPONENTS
FROM
RATIONAL
TO
HANDLE
DATA
STRUCTURES
AND
OTHER
MISCELLANEOUS
STUFF
ALLOCATORS
ETC
SO
THOSE
FEATURES
ARE
NOT
THAT
IMPORTANT
FOR
THIS
TOOLKIT
TO
HAVE
THE
TWO
THAT
I
HAVE
NARROWED
IT
DOWN
TO
ARE
ZAPP
AND
ZINC
THEY
SEEM
TO
BE
THE
TWO
TOOLKITS
THAT
HAVE
RECEIVED
THE
MOST
ATTENTION
FROM
THE
MEDIA
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
HAD
ANY
FIRSTHAND
EXPERIENCE
WITH
ANY
OF
THESE
TOOLKITS
ESPECIALLY
ZAPP
AND
ZINC
A
COUPLE
OF
OBSERVATIONS
ABOUT
THESE
TOOLKITS
THAT
SEEM
PARTICULARLY
NOTEWORTHY
ARE
ZAPP
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
THE
MOST
EXTENSIVE
COVERAGE
OF
WINDOWS
FUNCTIONALITY
AND
ALSO
INCLUDES
SOME
OTHER
MISCELLANEOUS
USEFUL
CLASSES
HAS
NEW
FANCY
CONTROLS
AVAILABLE
AND
SUPPORT
FOR
CUSTOM
CONTROLS
HAS
A
WINDOWS
NT
VERSION
ESSENTIAL
REDIRECTABLE
GRAPHICS
DISPLAYOUTPUT
ARCHITECTURE
USEFUL
FOR
PRINTING
SIZER
CLASS
FOR
AUTOMATICALLY
MANAGING
CONTROL
LAYOUT
AFTER
RESIZE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
NEWCOMER
THIS
COULD
BE
AN
ADVANTAGE
IN
DESIGNING
A
BETTER
SYSTEM
ZINC
HAS
A
PLATFORM
INDEPENDENT
RESOURCE
STRATEGY
NOT
TOO
IMPORTANT
FOR
ME
RIGHT
NOW
COMES
WITH
A
INTERFACE
BUILDER
TOOL
HAS
A
WINDOWS
NT
VERSION
ESSENTIAL
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
BEEN
AROUND
LONGER
MORE
MATURE
BUT
GREW
UP
OUT
OF
A
DOS
VERSION
HAD
A
BETTER
DEMO
BOTH
HAVE
SOURCE
CODE
AVAILABILITY
OPTIONS
BOTH
ARE
LACKING
OLE
SUPPORT
NEITHER
SEEM
TO
HAVE
ANY
PARTICULAR
SUPPORT
FOR
MULTIMEDIA
TYPE
STUFF
ANY
THOUGHTS
ANYONE
HAS
ON
THIS
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
THANKS
