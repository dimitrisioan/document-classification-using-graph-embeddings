IS
SUPPOSED
TO
READ
AND
WRITE
MAC
DISKS
IVE
NEVER
TRIED
IT
THOUGH
GOOD
LUCK
I
JUST
TRIED
IT
BUT
I
CANT
SAY
THAT
IT
WORKS
CAUSE
IT
DOESNT
READ
DISKS
IT
ONLY
READS
IF
THERE
A
PROGRAM
THAT
DOES
READ
DISKS
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
IM
NOT
SURE
THAT
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
DUE
TO
THE
WAY
THE
MAC
WRITES
THE
DISK
I
THINK
THE
WAY
THE
SECTORS
ARE
SET
UP
ARE
DIFFERENT
ENOUGH
THAT
A
PC
CANT
READ
IT
THIS
IS
A
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
