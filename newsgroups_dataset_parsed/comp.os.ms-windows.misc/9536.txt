windows
keeps
crashing
givinh
me
gpf
on
me
of
late
it
was
never
a
very
stable
package
but
now
it
seems
to
crash
every
day
the
worst
part
about
it
is
that
it
does
not
crash
consistently
ie
i
have
you
tried
setting
files
in
your
configsys
file
to
a
fairly
high
number
ive
got
mine
set
to
ive
seen
numbers
from
to
recommended
also
check
your
stacks
statement
is
a
good
starting
point
try
increasing
it
if
its
already
set
there
such
as
to
etc
both
stacks
and
files
have
been
identified
as
one
cause
of
frequent
crashes
