HAS
ANYONE
EXPERIENCED
A
FAINT
SHADOW
AT
ALL
RESOLUTIONS
USING
THIS
CARD
IS
ONLY
IN
WINDOWS
I
HAVE
REPLACED
CARD
AND
AM
WAITING
ON
LATEST
DRIVERS
ALSO
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
GENERAL
PROTECTION
FAULT
ERRORS
IN
WSPDPSFDRV
ON
WINWORD
TOOLS
OPTION
MENU
AND
IN
WINFAX
SETUP
I
HAD
A
ATI
ULTRA
BUT
WAS
GETTING
GENRAL
PROTECTION
FAULT
ERRORS
IN
AN
SPSS
APPLICATION
THESE
CARD
MANUFACTURES
MUST
HAVE
TERRIBLE
QUALITY
CONTROL
TO
LET
PRODUCTS
ON
THE
MARKET
WITH
SO
MANY
BUGS
WHAT
A
HASSLE
RUNNING
ON
GATEWAY
THX
DAVE
L
I
HAVE
USED
BOTH
VERSION
DRIVERS
FOR
WIN
AND
THE
NEW
DRIVERS
I
HAVE
HAD
NONE
OF
THESE
PROBLEMS
NO
GPFS
AT
ALL
I
HAVE
A
FEELING
THAT
YOUR
PROBLEMS
ARE
NOT
WITH
THE
CARD
OR
DRIVERS
THE
ATI
ULTRA
DRIVERS
ARE
CONSIDERED
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
RELIABLE
ON
THE
MARKET
AND
THE
SS
ONES
SEEM
QUITE
GOOD
AS
WELL
MAYBE
YOU
SHOULD
CHECK
BIOS
PROBLEMS
IN
YOUR
GATEWAY
I
KNOW
A
FEW
PEOPLE
WITH
GATEWAY
AND
ALL
OF
THEM
HAVE
FOUND
SOME
PROBLEM
OR
OTHER
WITH
COMPATIBILITY
ESPECIALLY
WITH
GRAPHICS
THE
ONLY
GPFS
I
HAVE
EVER
HAD
CAN
BE
DIRECTLY
ATTRIBUTABLE
TO
USING
ABUSING
APPLICATIONS
I
EVEN
GOT
THE
NEWEST
DRIVERS
FROM
DIAMOND
WHEN
PEOPLE
STARTED
COMPLAINING
I
STILL
ONLY
HAVE
ONE
SMALL
PROBLEM
WITH
THEM
AND
IT
IS
THAT
THE
HARDWARE
CURSOR
IS
SLIGHTLY
JUMPY

WRITES
