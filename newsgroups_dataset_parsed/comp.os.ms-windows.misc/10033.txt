I
COULDNT
FIND
ANYTHING
IN
THS
USER
MANUAL
IS
THERE
ANY
OTHER
REFERENCE
MATERIAL
WHICH
WOULD
GIVE
ME
THIS
INFORMATION
WELL
THIS
IS
ONLY
A
GUESS
IF
IT

HOPE
THIS
HELPS
YES
I
DO
HAVE
SOME
PRIOR
KNOWLEDGE
IN
THIS
THERE
IS
NOTHING
DANGEROUS
IN
THESE

THEY
ARE
TOTALLY
HARMLESS
BUT
MY
OPINION
IS
THAT
KICKING
THEM
MIGHT
NOT
BE
THE
RIGHT
WAY
TO
TEST
IT
SO
SHUT
UP
AND
RUN

MINE
