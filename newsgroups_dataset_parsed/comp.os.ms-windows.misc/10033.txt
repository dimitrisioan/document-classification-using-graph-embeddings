what
exactly
does
the
windows
bitmap
format
look
like
i
mean
how
is
the
data
stored
width
height
no
of
colours
bitmap
data
i
couldnt
find
anything
in
ths
user
manual
is
there
any
other
reference
material
which
would
give
me
this
information
well
this
is
only
a
guess
if
it
goes
by
the
true
meaning
of
bit
map
then
it
holds
xyc
where
x
pixel
number
in
th
exdirection
y
pixelnumber
in
the
ydir
c
colour
come
on
fellows
the
format
is
quite
plainly
explained
in
the
manuals
its
in
the
programmers
reference
volume
messages
structures
and
macros
mscdevkit
for
should
be
also
in
the
borlands
manuals
pages
depending
what
you
need
first
there
is
the
bitmapfileheaderstruct
then
the
bitmapinfo
which
contains
the
bitmapinfoheader
and
the
rgbquad
and
then
the
bitmap
data
and
there
is
also
a
example
among
the
example
files
mssdk
hope
this
helps
yes
i
do
have
some
prior
knowledge
in
this
there
is
nothing
dangerous
in
these
dragons
they
are
totally
harmless
but
my
opinion
is
that
kicking
them
might
not
be
the
right
way
to
test
it
so
shut
up
and
run
pjsincsunriseoulufi
pjsincphoenixoulufi
pjsinctolsunoulufi
if
its
possible
that
there
are
some
opinions
above
they
must
be
all
mine
