I
HAVE
A
MICROSOFT
SERIAL
MOUSE
AND
AM
USING
MOUSECOM
WAS
USING
I
THINK
BUT
SWITCHED
TO
TO
SEE
IF
IT
WAS
ANY
BETTER
VERTICAL
MOTION
IS
NICE
AND
SMOOTH
BUT
HORIZONTAL
MOTION
IS
SO
BAD
I
SOMETIMES
CANT
CLICK
ON
SOMETHING
BECAUSE
MY
MOUSE
JUMPS
AROUND
I
CAN
BE
MOVING
THE
MOUSE
TO
THE
RIGHT
WITH
RELATIVELY
UNIFORM
MOTION
AND
THE
MOUSE
WILL
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
TO
THE
RIGHT
THEN
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
AGAIN
MAYBE
THIS
TIME
TO
THE
LEFT
ABOUT
INCH
THIS
IS
CRAZY
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
SO
MUCH
TROUBLE
WITH
A
MOUSE
BEFORE
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
SOLUTIONS
DOES
MICROSOFT
THINK
THEY
ARE
WHAT
EVERYONE
SHOULD
BE
JUST
VENTING
STEAM
I
THINK
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
I
THINK
IT
IS
CAUSED
BY
THE
RUBBER
BALL
IN
THE
MOUSE
WHICH
DOESNT
ROLL
SO
SMOOTH
THE
DETECTORS
IN
THE
MOUSE
NOTICE
THIS
AND
WHOOPS
I
HIT
A
MINE
USING
MINESWEEPER
I
THINK
THE
SOLUTION
WILL
BE
BUYING
A
NEW
MOUSE
ANDOR
USING
A
MOUSE
PAD
WOUTER
ANDOR
TAKING
THE
RUBBER
BALL
OUT
OF
THE
MOUSE
SHOULD
BE
DIRECTIONS
IN
THE
MANUAL
OR
ON
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
MOUSE
AND
CLEANING
IT
WITH
ALCOHOL
ISOPROPYL
I
BELIEVE
THE
SAME
ALCOHOL
AS
USED
FOR
CLEANING
YOUR
CASSETTE
DECK
THIS
IS
GOOD
TO
DO
EVERY
SO
OFTEN
EVEN
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
MOUSE
PAD
DUST
STILL
GETS
CAUGHT
IN
THE
MOUSE
AND
ON
THE
RUBBER
BALL
AS
WELL
LINT
AND
OTHER
GARBAGE
MAY
FIND
ITS
WAY
ONTO
THE
RUBBER
BALL
AND
GET
INTO
THE
MOUSE
DAMAGING
THE
HORIZONTAL
AND
VERTICAL
SENSORS
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
GOOD
LUCK
