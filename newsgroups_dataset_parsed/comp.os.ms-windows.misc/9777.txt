MANAGER
FOR
WIN
ARE
THERE
ANY
WORKSPACE
MANAGERS
OUT
THERE
FOR
WINDOWS
BY
A
WORKSPACE
MANAGER
I
MEAN
SOMETHING
LIKE
THE
HP
APOLLO
WORKSTATIONS
HAVE
MULTIPLE
WORKSPACES
UNDER
X
THERE
IS
A
WINDOW
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
SCREEN
WHICH
ALLOWS
YOU
TO
SELECT
DIFFERENT
WORKSPACES
IT
OVERCOMES
THE
PROBLEM
OF
HAVING
STACKS
OF
WINDOWS
OPEN
ON
THE
ONE
SCREEN
INSTEAD
YOU
CAN
SPREAD
THEM
AMONGST
DIFFERENT
WORKSPACES
WHICH
ACT
LIKE
INDEPENDENT
SCREENS
AND
YOU
CAN
FLICK
BETWEEN
THEM
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
