about
dos
external
join
command
i
am
setting
up
my
dosunix
box
on
a
ide
and
a
scsi
drive
and
was
wondering
about
the
use
of
the
msdos
join
command
i
like
the
way
it
sets
things
up
since
i
wont
have
to
stick
with
the
c
d
e
crap
that
dos
enforces
i
like
how
it
would
mimic
mount
points
of
unix
filesystems
i
have
heard
that
there
were
problems
with
using
it
or
at
least
under
older
versions
of
dos
please
