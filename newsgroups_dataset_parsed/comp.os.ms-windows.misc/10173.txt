MUNCH
YOU
MUST
OF
READ
TOO
MANY
ADVERTISEMENTS
CRASH
PROTECTION
IS
SUCH
A
MARKETING
GIMICK
IT
ISNT
FUNNY
OUT
OF
MONTHS
OF
USING
WINDOWS
ON
MY
NEW
MACHINE
IVE
ONLY
HAD
IT
CRASH
ONCE
AND
I
DONT
HAVE
A
RUN
OF
THE
MILL
CONFIGURATION
MUNCH
FOLLOWING
IS
REFORMATTED
IT
DOES
SOUND
FUNNY
I
WILL
ADMIT
BUT
FOR
ME
IT
IS
TRUE
WINDOWS
CRASHED
ON
ALL
OF
THE
TIME
AND
FROM
WHAT
I
HAVE
READ
IN
PC
MAG
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
EXCEPTION
ID
SAY
THAT
THE
MASSIVE
CRASH
PROBLEMS
ARE
EXCEEDINGLY
RARE
WINDOWS
ITSELF
ALMOST
NEVER
CRASHES
BUT
IT
CAN
BE
CRASHED
BY
AN
ERRANT
APPLICATION
MY
PERSONAL
FAVORITE
ANY
ONE
OF
THE
COREL
PROGRAMS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
HAVE
HAD
CRASH
RANDOMLY
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
MOSTLY
JUST
RUNNING
ITS
OWN
APPLICATIONS
FOR
INSTANCE
TODAY
I
DISCOVERED
A
NEW
ONE
WHILE
I
WAS
DOWNLOADING
WITH
PROCOMM
PLUS
FOR
WINDOWS
RUNNING
SEAMLESS
WITH
THE
STANDARD
VGA
DRIVERS
ON
A
RUNO
DA
MILL
VGA
I
DECIDED
THAT
I
WANTED
TO
EDIT
A
COPY
OF
A
QUOTE
THAT
I
WANTED
TO
ADD
TO
MY
FINGER
BUT
SINCE
IVE
LEARNED
NOT
TO
REALLY
TRUST
SEAMLESS
I
FIRED
UP
A
FULL
SCREEN
SESSION
WHOOPS
THE
DOWNLOAD
FINISHED
WHILE
WAS
LOADING
IT
HAD
JUST
GOTTEN
THE
POINTER
UP
SO
I
HIT
ALTESCAPE
TO
GET
BACK
T
THE
DESKTOP
I
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
FONTS
SO
LOADING
TAKES
A
GOOD
LONG
WHILE
BLAM
SCREEN
TRASHED
PROCOMM
HANGS
UP
HM
WELL
I
CAN
SORTA
SEE
THE
MOUSE
SO
I
CLICKED
ON
THE
MINIMIZED
SESSION
AND
GOT
BACK
MY
FULLSCREEN
WINDOWS
SESSION
BUT
THE
COLOR
WERE
OFFRED
AND
GREEN
AND
YELLOW
AND
BROWN
INSTEAD
OF
BLUES
AND
GREYS
SO
I
CLOSED
THIS
AND
GOT
BACK
TO
THE
DESKTOP
NOW
FULLY
RESTORED
PP
WAS
STILL
SITTING
WINDOW
OPEN
BUT
IT
WAS
NO
LONGER
CONNECTED
TO
THE
COM
PORTSO
I
EXITED
IT
THE
NORMAL
WAY
IT
TOLD
ME
I
WAS
STILL
ONLINE
AND
IT
WOULD
HANG
UP
THOUGH
IT
WAS
ALREADY
HUNG
UP
HM
WELL
LOAD
ANOTHENO
BAD
IDEA
SHUTDOWN
AND
REBOOT
OK
REFRESH
FIRST
NOW
SHUTDOWN
YES
EVERYTHING
IS
CLOSED
HM
NOTHING
SEEMS
TO
BE
HAPPENING
LETS
SEE
AH
THE
WINDOWS
LIST
STILL
COMES
UP
OK
LETS
TRY
SHUTDOWN
AGAIN
NO
GO
HUH
ALRIGHT
WAIT
SECONDS
TO
SEE
IF
ITS
JUST
RUNNING
SLOW
HMM
STILL
SEEMS
TO
BE
RUNNING
TRY
SHUTDOWN
AGAIN
NOTHING
OH
WELL
REBOOT
ENJOY
THE
CHECKDISK
TIME
IN
THIS
CASE
A
PART
OF
THE
OS
CRASHED
NOT
ONLY
ITSELF
BUT
ENTIRELY
WHICH
ISNT
EVEN
SMART
ENOUGH
TO
TELL
WHEN
ITS
BEEN
COMPROMISED
I
GUESS
IN
EVERYDAY
SPECIFICALLY
TODAY
USE
GIVES
EACH
WINDOWS
APP
A
VDM
AND
THEY
CANT
TOUCH
EACH
OTHER
OR
GENERALLY
ANYTHING
THEY
ARENT
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
THATS
THE
IDEA
ANYWAY
IN
TRUTH
WHEN
A
PROGRAM
CRASHES
ON
IT
WILL
BRING
THE
SYSTEM
DOWN
WITH
IT
THE
PROGRAMS
THAT
WOULD
JUST
GPF
UNDER
WINDOWS
DO
THE
SAME
UNDER
BUT
PROGRAMS
THAT
ARE
FINE
UNDER
DOS
AND
WINDOWS
BRING
SCREAMING
TO
A
HALT
TASK
PROTECTION
OR
NO
FOR
INSTANCE
IM
STILL
WONDERING
WHY
PRINT
PREVIEW
IN
A
WINDOWED
WP
DOS
LOCKS
UP
MY
SYSTEM
IT
WORKS
FINE
UNDER
DOS
OR
EVEN
IN
A
DOS
BOX
UNDER
WINDOWS
ADMITTEDLY
IT
DOESNT
CRASH
IF
I
RUN
FULL
SCREEN
BUT
THE
FIRST
TIME
THIS
BUG
BIG
ME
IT
BIT
HARD
IF
WINDOWS
WORKS
FOR
YOU
THEN
GREAT
MAYBE
THIS
IS
WHY
SOME
PEOPLE
DONT
SEE
WHY
IS
THE
OS
OF
CHOICE
IF
WINDOWS
DOESNT
CRASH
ON
YOU
AND
YOU
DONT
MIND
WAITING
ON
EACH
TASK
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
THE
ONLY
TIME
I
WAIT
ON
ANYTHING
UNDER
WINDOWS
IS
WHEN
IM
COPYING
OR
FORMATTING
A
FLOPPY
OR
WHEN
PRINTING
AND
EVEN
THEN
NOT
LONGI
GET
TO
PAGES
DUMPED
TO
THE
PRINTMAN
PER
MINUTE
AND
CAN
STILL
GO
DO
THINGSSLOWLYWHILE
ITS
DOING
THISIVE
DOWNLOADED
WITH
PP
WHILE
PRINTING
AND
NOT
BEING
ABLE
TO
ADRESS
YOUR
MEMORY
BETTER
THAN
DOS
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
HERE
SEES
MEGS
USES
OR
SIX
OF
THESE
FOR
ITS
OWN
USE
MORE
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
COUNT
WINDOWS
SEES
MEGS
USES
OR
MORE
LIKE
IF
YOU
COUNT
THE
DISK
CACHE
AS
I
AM
FOR
FOR
ITSELF
IF
MEMORY
EFFICIENCY
WERE
A
BIG
ISSUE
PC
GEOS
WOULD
BE
THE
CURRENT
KING
OF
THE
INTEL
DESKTOP
SOME
OF
THE
KEY
REASONS
FOR
USING
ARE
GONE
I
PROBABLY
WOULD
STILL
USE
IT
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
MORE
OF
AN
EVEN
FIGHT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
AM
FINALLY
ABLE
TO
SAY
WITH
SOME
CONFIDENCE
THAT
BOTH
AND
WINDOWS
HAVE
A
BIT
OF
HARDWARE
SENSITIVITY
TO
THEM
FOR
INSTANCE
THE
MACHINE
I
AM
SITTING
AT
RUNS
BOTH
FINE
WHILE
THE
MACHINE
NEXT
TO
ME
CONSTANTLY
LOCKS
UP
UNDER
WINDOWS
BUT
RAN
WITHOUT
A
HITCH
ONCE
I
GOT
IT
THROUGH
A
INSTALL
ON
THE
WHOLE
ID
SAY
IS
A
WHOLE
LOT
MORE
SENSITIVE
THAN
WINDOWS
BUT
THERE
ARE
I
SUPPOSE
MACHINES
THAT
WINDOWS
JUST
DOESNT
LIKE
WITTISM
OF
TH
WEEK
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
WRONG
TO
BELIEVE
IN
AN
ISM
YOU
SHOULD
BELIEVE
IN
YOURSELF
FERRISH
BUELLER
WASNT
THIS
FERRIS
BUELLER
THERE
ARE
STUPID
LAWS
AND
THEN
THERE
ARE
STUPIDER
THAN
NORMAL
LAWS
