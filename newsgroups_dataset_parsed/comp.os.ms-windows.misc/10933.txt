i
just
received
a
gateway
with
windows
and
dos
i
ran
it
a
few
times
with
no
apparent
problems
i
decided
to
give
double
space
a
try
after
compressing
the
drive
with
no
problems
i
decided
to
load
windows
it
took
minute
seconds
to
load
after
dblspace
seconds
before
dblspace
i
tinkered
a
little
with
the
machine
and
noticed
an
error
message
saying
smartdrive
cannot
work
with
dblspace
the
reason
for
the
change
from
smartdrvexe
included
with
windows
to
smartdrvexe
included
with
dos
is
compatability
with
dblspace
be
sure
you
are
running
smartdrv
from
your
dos
directory
