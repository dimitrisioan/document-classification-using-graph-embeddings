THE

USUALLY
HAS
SMALL
INSTRUCTION
SET
SO
AS
TO
REDUCE
THE

AND
CAN
INCREASE
THE

YOU
CAN

ABOUT

HMM
NOT

AM
AN

I
CLEARLY
REMEMBER
READING
THAT
THE

SET
ON
RISC
CPUS
IS
RATHER
LARGE
THE

IS
IN

MODES
RISC
INSTRUCTION
SETS
ARE
NOT
AS
ORTHOGONAL
IS
CISC
THERE
ARE
SOME
THINGS
YOU
MIGHT
BE
INTERESTED
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
TODAYS
RISC
PROCESSORS
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
THERE
ARE
FEWER
INSTRUCTIONS
BUT
WHAT
IS
NOT
COMMONLY
KNOWN
IS
THAT
THIS
CAUSES
THE
SIZE
OF
YOUR
EXECUTABLES
TO
SWELL
SO
THAT
IN
SOME
CASES
PERFORMANCE
IS
SIMILAR
FOR
LARGER
APPLICATIONS
AS
A
COMPROMISE
MANY
RISC
PROCESSORS
TODAY
ARE
ACTUALLY
A
CROSS
BETWEEN
A
REDUCED
INSTRUCTIONS
SET
AND
A
COMPLEX
ONE
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
FUTURE
IN
CISC

CERTAINLY
PROVED
THAT
WHAT
I
WANT
