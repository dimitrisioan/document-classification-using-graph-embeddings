help
needed
w
dos
apps
and
windows
since
loading
windows
two
of
my
dos
applications
have
been
acting
strangely
it
appears
that
font
changes
and
page
orientation
changes
so
far
are
not
being
recognized
in
wordperfectdos
and
quattroprodos
another
dos
application
does
accept
font
and
page
orientation
changes
so
i
dont
think
the
problem
is
with
the
printer
i
reloaded
quattropro
and
these
changes
are
still
not
accepted
whether
launching
from
windows
or
the
dos
prompt
does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
as
to
where
to
look
or
how
to
correct
this
problem
ive
ordered
quattropro
for
windows
but
need
a
landscape
application
printed
immediately
please
email
thanks
in
advance
