JACK
HUDLER
WRITES
ITS
CALLED
THE
FREE
ENTERPRIZE
SYSTEM
I
SUGGESTS
THAT
THOSE
WHO
WISH
TO
ENHANCE
DOS
DO
IT
AN
SELL
IT
OR
GIVE
IT
AWAY
MICROSOFT
CANT
BE
EVERYTHING
TO
EVERYONE
PERIOD
IT
HAS
BEEN
DONE
BUT
THE
OTHER
COMPANIES
DONT
HAVE
THE
MARKETING
BUDGETS
THAT
MS
DO
FOR
INSTANCE
IS
EVERYTHING
THAT
COMMANDCOM
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BUT
NEVER
COULD
BE
UNDER
MS
THOSE
WHO
USE
IT
USUALLY
FIND
IT
MORE
ADDICTIVE
THAN
CRACK
COCAINE
BUT
THEY
HAVE
TO
RELY
ON
WORD
OF
MOUTH
FOR
SALES
IT
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
WORKED
PRETTY
GOOD
SO
FAR
BUT
YOUR
CORPORATE
WEENIE
MANAGER
TYPE
USUALLY
LIKES
TO
SEE
A
BIG
GLOSSY
AD
IN
PC
MAGAZINE
THATS
OKAY
MARKETING
ISNT
A
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHT
BUT
THEYVE
GOT
A
PRODUCT
THATS
SUPERIOR
TO
THE
DOS
COMMAND
INTERPRETER
IN
EVERY
WAY
THEY
HAVE
A
LOT
MORE
TO
BE
PROUD
OF
THAN
MS
DOES
IF
MS
REALLY
GAVE
A
DAMN
THEY
COULD
DUPLICATE
IT
BUY
IT
OUTRIGHT
THEYVE
GOT
THE
MONEY
OR
EVEN
USE
THE
OLD
RUSE
OF
SENDING
ENGINEERS
OUT
TO
HELP
THEM
WITH
COMPATABILITY
ISSUES
AND
ABSCONDING
WITH
THE
TECHNOLOGY
DOS
IS
A
MEDIOCRE
PRODUCT
AT
A
CHEAP
PRICE
BACKED
UP
BY
TOP
NOTCH
MARKETING
AND
VENDOR
AGREEMENTS
THE
MEDIOCRE
WAS
EXCUSABLE
IN
THE
EARLY
DAYS
WHEN
IT
WAS
SOMEONE
ELSES
HACK
BUT
THEYVE
HAD
TEN
YEARS
TO
PLAY
WITH
IT
AN
INTERESTING
THOUGHT
ON
THAT
MOST
MS
PRODUCTS
THAT
IM
AWARE
OF
IN
THE
LAST
FEW
YEARS
ALLOW
YOU
TO
ACCESS
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
DESIGNERS
AND
PROGRAMMERS
THROUGH
EASTER
EGG
SCREENS
INCLUDING
WINDOWS
OR
AT
LEAST
HAVE
THE
NAMES
BURIED
IN
THE
FILES
IS
THERE
SUCH
A
THING
IN
DOS
AND
OR
ARE
THEY
TOO
ASHAMED
TO
HAVE
THEIR
NAMES
ON
IT
THERES
AT
LEAST
ONE
FOOL
IN
EVERY
MARRIED
COUPLE
