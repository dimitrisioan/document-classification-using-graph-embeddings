I
AGREE
NO
ONE
EVER
DEFINITIVELY
MET
MY
CHALLENGE
ONLY
BATTED
AROUND
SEMANTICS
OH
WELL
I
GUESS
THINGS
DID
TURN
OUT
AS
I
EXPECTED
HMMM
I
GAVE
TWO
EXAMPLES
WHICH
MATCHED
YOUR
OBJECTIVE
CRITERIA
AND
YOUR
RESPONSE
WAS
SOME
SUBJECTIVE
CLAPTRAP
ABOUT
THEM
BEING
LAME
YOU
NEVER
DID
COUNTER
THE
FACT
THAT
THOSE
EXAMPLES
FIT
YOUR
OBJECTIVE
CRITERIA
I
REPEAT
WHAT
ARE
THEY
YOU
MENTIONED
WHAT
YOU
TRIED
TO
PRESENT
AS
INNOVATIVE
BUT
WHAT
NEW
CONCEPT
WAS
BROUGHT
TO
MARKET
AN
EFFICIENT
BASIC
BASIC
EXISTED
BEFORE
AND
EFFICIENCY
IS
NOT
ORIGINAL
EITHER
OLE
WHAT
NEW
CONCEPT
DOES
THAT
BRING
DOCUMENT
ORIENTED
COMPUTING
THE
MAC
HAD
THAT
BEFORE
MSW
YOU
SIMPLY
HAVENT
MADE
YOUR
POINT
THE
BURDEN
OF
PROOF
IS
UPON
YOU
MY
EXACT
CHALLENGE
WHAT
NEW
COMPUTING
CONCEPT
HAS
MS
BROUGHT
TO
MARKET
FIRST
NOTHING
MORE
NOTHING
LESS
EXPLAIN
HOW
YOUR
EXAMPLES
FIT
THAT
CRITERION
HMMHAS
ANYONE
OF
US
COMPUTER
GEEKS
ME
INCLUDED
EVER
CONSIDER
THAT
INOVATION
IS
NOT
LIMITED
TO
SOFTWAREHARDWARE
TRUE
MS
PRODUCTS
DO
NOT
BOAST
FEATURES
THAT
MS
INVENTED
BUT
HOW
MANY
PRODUCTS
OUT
THERE
BY
OTHER
VENDORS
OUT
THERE
ARE
TRUELY
INNOVATIVE
IN
THEIR
CONTINUING
DEVELOPMENT
I
THINK
WHAT
MAKES
MS
SPECIAL
TO
THE
PUBLIC
IS
THIER
INNOVATIVE
PRICING
IT
IS
TRUE
THE
XWINDOWSMACNEXT
ALL
HAVE
SOME
FEATURES
IN
THIER
GUI
THAT
ARE
BETTER
THAN
MS
BUT
PEOPLE
LIKE
ME
CANT
AFFORD
THEM
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
APPLE
HAS
LOWER
THEIR
PRICING
ON
THE
LOW
END
MODELS
BUT
THEY
ARE
JUST
THATLOW
END
SYSTEM
IS
A
BETTER
OPERATING
SYSTEM
BUT
THE
MACHINES
THEY
OPERATE
ON
JUST
ARE
TOO
EXPENSIVE
FOR
MY
TASTESA
UNIX
PLATFORM
IS
POWERFUL
ENUF
BUT
TELL
THE
COMMON
USER
TO
SET
UP
XDEFAULT
I
AM
STILL
CONFUSED
ON
WHAT
SOME
OF
THEM
THINGS
DO
AND
THEY
EITHER
PUKE
OR
FAINT
IF
U
THINK
ABOUT
IT
LOW
PRICES
AINT
INNOVATIVE
IF
U
COME
DOWN
TO
IT
BUT
FOR
THE
PRODUCT
IT
OFFERS
AND
ON
THE
LOWER
COST
AND
POWERFUL
HARDWARE
THAT
IT
RUNS
ON
AS
COMPARE
TO
MACSMS
IS
KINDA
INNOVATIVE
OH
YEA
I
GUESS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
SUPPORT
PRODUCTS
AND
APPLICATIONS
THEY
HAVE
GARNERED
FOR
MSWINDOWS
DOES
MAKE
THEM
KINDA
INNOVATIVE
