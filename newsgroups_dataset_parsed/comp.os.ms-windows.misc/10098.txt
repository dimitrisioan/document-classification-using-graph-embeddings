does
anyone
have
the
documentation
for
the
ms
mouse
driver
i
got
it
when
i
got
windows
but
my
windows
manual
does
not
come
with
the
documentation
in
particular
i
need
to
know
how
to
turn
it
off
and
how
to
speed
it
up
outside
windows
the
greater
sensitivity
is
needed
so
i
can
play
various
games
esp
xwing
the
sensitivity
is
changed
using
the
s
v
or
h
parameter
the
commands
do
the
following
v
vertical
sensitivity
h
horizontal
sensitivity
s
both
follow
the
parameter
with
a
number
from
to
slowest
the
default
is
you
can
type
the
command
mouse
right
from
the
keyboard
or
add
it
to
autoexecbat
hope
this
helps
