strange
enhanced
behavior
howdy
we
have
been
having
a
real
problem
with
an
ast
machine
with
of
ram
we
installed
paradox
for
windows
but
i
dont
think
paradox
is
the
real
problem
here
and
the
installation
went
ok
windows
is
installed
on
a
local
drive
paradox
installed
on
a
novell
network
netware
or
greater
dos
win
but
the
program
will
not
load
in
enchanted
mode
the
thermometer
bar
goes
to
and
we
then
either
get
a
invalid
commandcom
or
a
windows
nastygram
talking
about
an
illegal
instruction
ive
checked
out
the
commandcom
thing
but
as
a
longtime
c
programmer
ive
crashed
my
share
of
machines
with
pointer
problems
and
this
is
a
standard
behavior
anyway
paradox
will
run
in
standard
mode
but
not
enhanced
we
also
have
quattro
pro
windows
exhibiting
the
same
behavior
spent
about
hours
with
borlands
tech
people
with
no
avail
the
guy
i
talked
to
a
microsoft
didnt
want
to
really
dig
in
and
help
as
he
gave
up
pretty
quickly
somewhat
disappointing
really
i
expected
more
from
microsoft
youd
think
with
all
the
millions
of
windows
installations
that
they
would
have
seen
all
the
possible
problems
but
i
guess
not
microsoft
had
sent
us
a
page
fax
on
fixing
uae
and
general
protection
faults
sorry
i
cant
fax
anything
out
of
here
so
please
dont
ask
try
microsoft
which
we
tried
we
did
everything
they
said
and
still
no
luck
so
if
you
can
help
please
mail
me
this
problem
is
driving
us
nuts
i
will
greatly
appreciate
any
information
anyone
can
pass
on
thanks
