re
using
microsoft
foundation
classes
with
borland
c
hi
all
has
anybody
tried
to
compile
ctrltest
from
the
mfcsamples
directory
after
compiling
the
mfclibs
with
bwc
seems
to
me
that
bwc
isnt
able
to
distinguish
pointers
to
overloaded
functions
for
example
imagine
the
following
overloaded
functions
void
samename
void
void
samename
int
after
trying
the
whole
day
i
think
with
bwc
its
impossible
to
take
the
adress
of
one
of
the
above
two
functions
and
assign
it
to
a
properly
defined
function
pointer
am
i
right
has
anybody
else
had
this
problem
thanx
