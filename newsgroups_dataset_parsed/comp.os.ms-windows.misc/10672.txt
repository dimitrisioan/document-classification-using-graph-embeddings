HELP
FROM
C
DOELLE
HELLO
ALL
IT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
ALL
TRUETYPE
FONTS
IN
WINDOWS
ARE
LOADED
IN
PRIOR
TO
STARTING
WINDOWS
THIS
MAKES
GETTING
INTO
WINDOWS
QUITE
SLOW
IF
YOU
HAVE
HUNDREDS
OF
THEM
AS
I
DO
FIRST
OFF
AM
I
CORRECT
IN
THIS
THINKING
SECONDLY
IF
THAT
IS
THE
CASE
CAN
YOU
GET
WINDOWS
TO
IGNORE
THEM
ON
BOOT
AND
MAYBE
MAKE
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
PIF
FILE
TO
LOAD
THEM
ONLY
WHEN
YOU
ENTER
THE
APPLICATIONS
THAT
NEED
FONTS
ANY
IDEAS
