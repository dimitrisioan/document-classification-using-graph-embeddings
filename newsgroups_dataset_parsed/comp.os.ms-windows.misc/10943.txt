it
is
your
opinion
that
is
inferior

competition
thats
not
the
same
as
being
objectively
inferior
no
it
is
technically
inferior
to
the
osguis
that
i
listed
ok
now
you
are
starting
to
define
your
criteria
by
this
criterion
it
is
inferior
im
afraid
that
you
havent
actually
proved
that
you
have
shown
that
some
aspects
of
are
technically
inferior
to
other
systems
as
i
said
earlier
if
this
is
all
you
are
trying
to
say
then
it
is
trivially
true
but
some
aspects
of
are
actually
technically
superior
to
each
of
the
other
systems
resource
requirements
performace
device
support
printer
support
gui
etc
btw
id
love
to
see
the
studies
which
show
that
unixx
is
as
easy
to
learn
as
windows
but
i
might
even
agree
that
on
balance
is
technically
inferior
to
some
of
the
competition
this
still
does
not
prove
your
point
if
you
have
another
then
perhaps
i
am
incorrect
range
of
available
applications
base
os
cost
cost
of
applications
cost
of
hardware
multiplatform
support
quality
of
the
aftersales
service
availability
of
bookstraining
materials
support
for
visual
and
physical
handicaps
suitability
for
use
in
mobile
computing
quality
of
documentation
if
you
think
that
technical
excellence
is
the
only
factor
when
deciding
on
an
os
or
indeed
the
primary
factor
you
need
to
think
again
