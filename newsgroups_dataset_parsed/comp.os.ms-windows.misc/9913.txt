I
HAVE
A
MICROSOFT
SERIAL
MOUSE
AND
AM
USING
MOUSECOM
WAS
USING
I
THINK
BUT
SWITCHED
TO
TO
SEE
IF
IT
WAS
ANY
BETTER
VERTICAL
MOTION
IS
NICE
AND
SMOOTH
BUT
HORIZONTAL
MOTION
IS
SO
BAD
I
SOMETIMES
CANT
CLICK
ON
SOMETHING
BECAUSE
MY
MOUSE
JUMPS
AROUND
I
CAN
BE
MOVING
THE
MOUSE
TO
THE
RIGHT
WITH
RELATIVELY
UNIFORM
MOTION
AND
THE
MOUSE
WILL
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
TO
THE
RIGHT
THEN
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
AGAIN
MAYBE
THIS
TIME
TO
THE
LEFT
ABOUT
INCH
THIS
IS
CRAZY
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
SO
MUCH
TROUBLE
WITH
A
MOUSE
BEFORE
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
SOLUTIONS
DOES
MICROSOFT
THINK
THEY
ARE
WHAT
EVERYONE
SHOULD
BE
JUST
VENTING
STEAM
I
HAD
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
AT
FIRST
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
THE
VIDEO
DRIVER
AND
MADE
SURE
I
HAD
THE
MOST
CURRENT
DRIVERS
BECAUSE
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
MOST
EVIDENT
AT
SVGA
RESOLUTION
MODES
IT
DIDNT
HELP
AND
AFTER
A
BIT
OF
EXPERIMENTATION
DETERMINED
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
EXISTED
IN
STANDARD
VGA
RESOLUTION
MODE
IT
WAS
JUST
MUCH
LESS
NOTICEABLE
MY
MOUSE
WAS
AN
OLDER
MS
SERIAL
VERSION
I
BOUGHT
SECOND
HAND
IN
IT
WORKED
JUST
FINE
IN
DOS
AND
DOS
BASED
GRAPHIC
APPLICATIONS
ON
THE
GUESS
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
WITH
THE
RESOLUTION
OF
THE
MOUSE
I
BORROWED
A
NEW
MOUSE
A
MS
BUS
MODEL
AND
TRIED
IT
THAT
SOLVED
THE
PROBLEM
SO
IF
YOUR
MOUSE
IS
OLD
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
TRY
REPLACING
IT
FOR
A
NEWER
ONE
ANOTHER
ALTERNATIVE
IS
TO
CLEAN
THE
MOUSE
YOUVE
GOT
SOMETIMES
THE
ROLLERS
INSIDE
THE
MOUSE
PICK
UP
A
BALL
OF
LINT
OR
OTHER
DEBRIS
OPEN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
MOUSE
TAKE
OUT
THE
BALL
AND
USE
SOME
ALCOHOL
ON
A
QTIP
TO
CLEAN
IT
OUT
INSPECT
THE
INSIDE
FOR
ANY
HAIRS
OR
FUZZ
I
HAVE
HAD
MY
MOUSE
GET
REAL
JUMPY
AND
CLEARED
UP
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
PROCEDURE
