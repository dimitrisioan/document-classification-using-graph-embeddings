issues

security

compatability
rationale
microsoft
nt
is
the
newest
member
of
the
microsoft
windows
family
of
operating
systems
or
operating
environments
for
those
who
wish
to
argue
about
the
meaning
of
an
os
the
family
ranges
from
modular
windows
through
windows
and
windows
for
workgroups
to
windows
nt
at
the
high
end
to
date
microsoft
has
shipped
over
beta
copies
and
prerelease
sdks
of
windows
nt
the
actual
release
is
slated
for
mayjune
while
windows
nt
has
an
entirely
new
design
internally
it
shares
an
application
programming
interface
with
the
other
members
of
the
windows
family
its
api
includes
the
api
used
in
win
dows
and
the
api
subset
less
threads
networking
and
security
can
be
used
to
create
applications
for
windows
the
user
interface
is
also
practically
identical
to
that
of
windows
with
the
addition
of
logins
and
a
few
other
features
it
uses
program
manager
file
manager
and
other
applets
and
generally
pre
sents
an
identical
appearance
to
the
user
many
of
the
announced
windows
nt
applications
are
ports
of
existing
windows
apps
and
nt
also
runs
existing
applications
thus
it
appears
logical
that
windows
nt
should
share
the
following
groups
with
the
other
members
of
the
windows
family
composmswindowsapps
composmswindowsprogrammertools
composmswindowsprogrammermisc
the
following
groups
are
also
clearly
applicable
to
windows
nt
as
well
as
windows
composmswindowsannounce
composmswindowsadvocacy
in
conclusion
the
only
clear
argument
for
the
separation
of
the
windows
and
windows
nt
hierarchies
is
different
internal
structures
of
windows
and
windows
nt
and
yet
operating
systems
such
as
macintosh
os
xenix
and
coherent
all
have
undergone
major
rewrites
without
having
been
split
into
separate
newsgroup
hierarchies
further
windows
is
due
for
a
major
rewrite
itself
in
when
the
fully
protectedmode
and
withdosbuiltin
next
generation
windows
chicago
debuts
next
year
surely
it
should
remain
in
the
same
hierarchy
and
what
then
would
be
the
jus
tification
for
separating
windows
nt
from
other
windows
versions

period
the
discussion
period
will
run
from
april
to
may

the
cfv

for

will
be
