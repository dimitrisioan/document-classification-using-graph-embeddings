had
a
bunch
of
problems
with
the
opening
a
dos
window
on
the
desktop
can
occasionally
result
in
the
windows
blowing
up
into
a
set
of
horizontal
lines
hashing
the
entire
desktop
nothing
can
recover
this
except
to
completely
exit
from
windows
the
other
irritating
problem
is
that
windows
that
scroll
often
overwrite
lines
rather
than
actually

got
these
replies
which
i
am
testing
so
far
