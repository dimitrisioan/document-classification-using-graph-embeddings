so
many
apps

so
does
the
development
software
companies
dont
stay
in
business
writing
apps
that
wont
generate
revenue
the
fact
that
ibm
was
paying
them
for
it
allowed
them
to
do
it
and
stay
in
business
how
many
apps

much
revenue
they
are
getting

do
have
an
interesting
point
that
i
wont
dispute
now
but
pray
tell
if
you
know
for
a
fact
anything
why
dont
you
provided
some
insight
into
your

you
think
that

if
he
says
he
knows
for
a
fact
what
more
do
you
have
to
gain
if
he
gives
his
word
do
you
think
hes
lying
right
now
but
cmonit
would
appear
that
you
are
employed
by
the
competitionyou
should
expect
to
asked
about
your
sources
and
just
give
them
