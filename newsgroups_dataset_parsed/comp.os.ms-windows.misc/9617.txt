SCOTT
P
REIMERT
WRITES
SOMEWHERE
IN
THIS
THREAD
IT
HAS
BEEN
SAID
THAT
WINDOWS
NT
TM
IS
A
MULTIUSER
OS
AS
WELL
AS
MULTITHREADING
ETC
I
CERTAINLY
HAVENT
SEEN
THIS
TO
BE
THE
CASE
THERE
ARE
SEPERATE
ACCOUNTS
FOR
EACH
PERSON
AND
EVEN
SEPERATE
DIRECTORIES
IF
THAT
IS
DESIRED
I
DONT
SEE
AN
IMPLENTATION
OF
SIMULTANEUOS
USE
THOUGH
SINCE
RUNNING
ANY
GUI
OVER
A
NETWORK
IS
GOING
TO
SLOW
IT
DOWN
BY
A
FAIR
AMOUNT
I
EXPECT
WINDOWS
NT
WILL
BE
MULTIUSER
ONLY
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
SHARING
FILESYSTEMS
SOMEONE
WILL
LIKELY
WRITE
A
TELNETD
FOR
IT
SO
ONE
COULD
RUN
CHARACTERBASED
APPS
BUT
GRAPHICSBASED
APPS
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
SHARED
BY
RUNNING
THE
EXECUTABLES
ON
THE
LOCAL
CPU
THIS
IS
HOW
THINGS
ARE
SHAPING
UP
EVERYWHERE
CLIENTSERVER
ARCHITECTURES
ARE
TAKING
OVER
FROM
THE
OLD
CPUTERMINAL
SETUPS
NOTE
THAT
THE
NEXT
DOES
THIS
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
TELNET
INTO
A
NEXT
AND
RUN
CHARACTERBASED
APPS
BUT
YOU
CANT
RUN
THE
GUI
YEAH
I
KNOW
ABOUT
XWINDOWS
JUST
HAVENT
BEEN
TOO
IMPRESSED
BY
IT
