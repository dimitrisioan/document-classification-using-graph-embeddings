VERY
USER
UNFRIENDLY
THIS
INTERFACE
MAKES

THIS
INTERFACE

WHAT
FILES
DO
I
NEED
TO
DOWNLOAD
FOR
GHOSTSCRIPT
I
HAVE
NEVER
USED
GHOSTSCRIPT
BEFORE
SO
I
DONT
HAVE

FILES
FOR
IT
WHAT
I
DO
HAVE
IS
WHICH

DOWNLOADED
FROM

UNFORTUNATELY
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
WORK
ON
ITS
OWN

THAT
I
DONT
HAVE
I
WANT
TO
RUN
GHOSTSCRIPT
BOTH

MSDOS
ON
A

I
UNDERSTAND
THERES

FOR
BOTH
ENVIRONMENTS
