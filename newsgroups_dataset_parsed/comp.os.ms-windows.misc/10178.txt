YAMANARI
WRITES
ID
SAY
THAT
THE
MASSIVE
CRASH
PROBLEMS
ARE
EXCEEDINGLY
RARE
WINDOWS
ITSELF
ALMOST
NEVER
CRASHES
BUT
IT
CAN
BE
CRASHED
BY
AN
ERRANT
APPLICATION
MY
PERSONAL
FAVORITE
ANY
ONE
OF
THE
COREL
PROGRAMS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
I
HAVE
HAD
CRASH
RANDOMLY
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
MOSTLY
JUST
RUNNING
ITS
OWN
APPLICATIONS
I
DO
KNOW
THAT
IBM
SYSTEMS
THE
IN
PARTICULAR
HAVE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
HAD
A
RANDOM
CRASH
WHILE
RUNNING
ANY
OF
MY
PROGRAMS
UNDER
IN
FACT
I
DONT
REMEMBER
EVER
CRASHING
OF
COURSE
I
REALLY
DONT
RUN
ANY
PROGRAMS
JUST
THE
SAME
BUNCH
OF
DOS
AND
WINDOWS
STUFF
THAT
IVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
RUNNING
AND
WHEN
I
HAD
THE
THIS
IS
THE
SYSTEM
RUNNING
DOSWINDOWS
I
HAD
ONLY
ONE
CRASH
AND
IT
WAS
CONSISTENT
FTP
HAD
A
TENDENCY
TO
CRASH
WHENEVER
I
WOULD
GET
LARGE
FILES
FROM
PARTICULARLY
FAST
CLIENTS
DTRS
I
FIGURED
OUT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
WITH
SMARTDRVS
WRITE
BUFFERINGIF
I
TURNED
OFF
THE
WRITE
BUFFER
EVERYTHING
WOULD
WORK
FINE
FTP
UNDER
HAS
NEVER
LOCKED
THOUGH
I
CAN
EVEN
FORMAT
FLOPPIES
TO
USE
THE
MOST
OFTEN
CITED
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
SUPERIORITY
OF
FOR
INSTANCE
IM
STILL
WONDERING
WHY
PRINT
PREVIEW
IN
A
WINDOWED
WP
DOS
LOCKS
UP
MY
SYSTEM
YEAH
I
GUESS
IM
WILLING
TO
ADMIT
THAT
IS
SOMEWHAT
SENSITIVE
TO
SPECIFIC
HARDWARE
FOR
DOS
WORKS
PERFECTLY
FINE
ON
MY
PLEASE
EXPLAIN
THE
ONLY
TIME
I
WAIT
ON
ANYTHING
UNDER
WINDOWS
IS
WHEN
IM
COPYING
OR
FORMATTING
A
FLOPPY
OR
WHEN
PRINTING
AND
EVEN
THEN
NOT
LONGI
GET
TO
PAGES
DUMPED
TO
THE
PRINTMAN
PER
MINUTE
AND
CAN
STILL
GO
DO
THINGSSLOWLYWHILE
ITS
DOING
THISIVE
DOWNLOADED
WITH
PP
WHILE
PRINTING
WELL
I
SAVE
ALL
MY
PERSONAL
FILES
TO
FLOPPY
AND
WHEN
I
DID
THAT
UNDER
WINDOWS
A
FLOPPY
SAVE
OF
A
LARGE
FILE
HUNG
UP
THE
SYSTEM
I
ALSO
FOUND
IT
QUITE
BOTHERSOME
TO
HAVE
TO
CONTINUALLY
TWEAK
THE
TASKING
OPTIONS
ON
FRACTINT
FOR
DOS
WHENEVER
I
WANTED
TO
DO
A
FRACTAL
COMPUTATION
IN
THE
BACKGROUND
AND
NOT
BEING
ABLE
TO
ADDRESS
YOUR
MEMORY
BETTER
THAN
DOS
NOT
SURE
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
HERE
THE
IDEA
IS
THAT
DOS
SESSIONS
CAN
SEE
MORE
MEMORY
THAN
WINDOWS
DOS
SESSIONS
I
LET
XPL
A
SHAREWARE
CALCULUS
PROGRAM
SEE
AROUND
OF
FREE
CONVENTIONAL
MEMORY
WHICH
LETS
ME
DO
BIGGER
SYMBOLIC
MANIPULATIONS
THAN
IS
POSSIBLE
UNDER
STRAIGHT
DOS
WHERE
IT
WOULD
SEE
AROUND
OF
CONVENTIONAL
RAM
I
ALSO
FOUND
IT
REALLY
HANDY
FOR
MY
OWN
DOSBASED
PROGRAMS
WHICH
WITHOUT
ANY
REWRITING
COULD
NOW
HANDLE
LARGER
DATA
SETS
SIMULATE
FOR
MORE
ITERATIONS
ETC
OF
COURSE
THE
POINT
IS
NOW
MOOT
SINCE
THE
PROGRAMS
I
NOW
WRITE
SIMPLY
NEVER
RUN
INTO
MEMORY
LIMITATIONS
I
NEVER
PROGRAMMED
FOR
WINDOWS
SO
I
DONT
HAVE
MUCH
OF
A
COMPARISON
HERE
THOUGH
