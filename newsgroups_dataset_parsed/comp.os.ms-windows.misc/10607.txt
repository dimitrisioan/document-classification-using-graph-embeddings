TJR
CUTTS
WRITES
EVEN
SO
MY
POINT
STILL
STANDS
TO
AN
EXTENT
THAT
LIMITS
APPEAR
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
WHERE
THEY
REALLY
ARE
NOT
NECESSARY
SUCH
AS
THE
EDIT
CONTROL
LIMIT
WHILE
THE
LIMIT
MAY
NOT
BE
NECESSARY
LIMITATION
THEY
PROBABLY
FALL
WITHIN
THE
CATEGORY
OF
REASONABLE
LIMITATIONS
IF
YOU
FIND
YOURSELF
TRYING
TO
ALLOCATE
AN
EDIT
CONTROL
FOR
MORE
THAN
OF
TEXT
ITS
PROBABLY
TIME
TAKE
A
GOOD
LOOK
AT
YOUR
PROGRAMS
DESIGN
WHY
IS
THERE
SUCH
A
SMALL
LIMIT
TO
THE
NUMBER
OF
GLOBAL
MEMORY
HANDLES
ALLOWED
IN
WHAT
WAY
IS
A
SMALL
NUMBER
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOUD
HIT
THE
WALL
IN
MANY
OTHER
WAYS
BEFORE
YOUD
HIT
THE
SYSTEMWIDE
LIMIT
ON
GLOBAL
HANDLES
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
YOURE
ABUSING
GLOBALALLOC
AND
PLEASE
DONT
TRY
TO
TELL
ME
THAT
ITS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ABUSE
THE
RESOURCES
AVAILABLE
UNDER
OTHER
OPERATING
SYSTEMS
ALL
SYSTEMS
HAVE
LIMITS
THE
QUESTION
IS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
LIMITS
ARE
REASONABLE
SO
FAR
YOU
HAVENT
OFFERED
A
SINGLE
ARGUMENT
WHICH
SUGGESTS
THAT
WINDOWS
LIMITS
ARE
ANY
LESS
REASONABLE
THAN
LIMITS

OTHER
