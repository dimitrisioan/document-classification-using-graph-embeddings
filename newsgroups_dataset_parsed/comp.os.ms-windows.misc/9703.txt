i
am
considering
buying
borlands
paradox
for
windows
since
i
would
like
to
use
a
database
with
windows
i
dont
haveuse
one
yet
for
both
workhome
use
i
would
like
to
advantage
of
borlands
until
april
offer
if
this
package
is
everything
that
borland
claims
it
to
be
so
i
was
wondering
has
anybody
used
this
andor
have
any
opinions
yes
and
its
pretty
much
what
they
claim
i
havent
had
time
to
try
all
of
it
considering
the
price
even
if
you
decide
you
dont
like
it
it
should
be
saleable
over
the
next
months
for
what
you
have
in
it
once
the
price
goes
up
all
in
all
its
very
serviceable
and
in
my
humble
opinion
more
powerful
than
access
