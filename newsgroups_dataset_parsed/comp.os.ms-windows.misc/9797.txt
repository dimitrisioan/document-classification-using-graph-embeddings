I
HAVE
A
COMPUTER
WITH
A
SOUNDBLASTER
CARD
IM
RUNNING
MICROSOFT
WINDOWS
I
HAVE
THE
SB
DRIVER
SET
UP
PROPERLY
TO
PLAY
NORMAL
SOUNDS
WAV
FILES
ETC
I
WANT
TO
PLAY
MIDI
FILES
THROUGH
THE
MEDIA
PLAYER
THAT
IS
INCLUDED
WITH
WINDOWS
I
KNOW
I
HAVE
TO
SET
UP
THE
PATCH
MAPS
OR
SOMETHING
IN
THE
MIDIMAPPER
IN
THE
CONTROL
PANEL
I
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
MIDI
THIS
IS
TO
BE
THE
WAY
ILL
GET
MY
FEET
WET
HOW
DO
I
SET
UP
WINDOWS
SO
THAT
I
CAN
PLAY
MIDI
FILES
IF
YOU
INSTALL
THE
SOUNDBLASTER
WINDOWS
DRIVERS
CORRECTLY
AND
HAVE
THE
LATEST
DRIVERS
THE

SHOULD
BE

IN

UPGRADE
KIT
YOULL
FIND
THAT
MIDI
FILES
EXIST
WITH
ALL
KINDS
OF
DIFFERENT
MAPPINGS
SO
DONT
EXPECT
THEM
TO
ALWAYS
SOUND
CORRECT
WITHOUT
USING
SOME
KIND
OF

EDITOR
SUCH
AS
VOYETRAS
SEQUENCER
PLUS
YOU
CAN
ATTEMPT
TO
USE
THE
MIDIMAPPER
TO
REMAP
THE
PATCHES
FOR
SOUNDBLASTER
BUT
SINCE
YOU
CANNOT
MODIFY
THE
SBFMDRV
YOU
ARE
ALLWAYS
STUCK
WITH
THE
INSTRUMENTS
THAT
COME
WITH
THIS
DRIVER
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
FIND
AN
EDITOR
FOR
MAKING
MODIFICATIONS
TO
THE
INSTRUMENT
SETTINGS
IN
SBFMDRV
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
YOU
LOCATE
THE
EARLY
VERSION
OF
SOUNDBLASTER
DRIVERS
THAT
WERE
MAPPED
TO
VOICES
AND
THE
LATER
DRIVERS
THAT
ARE
MAPPED
TO
