RE
HEADTOHEAD
WIN
AND
I
REALLY
THINK
YOU
ARE
COMPARING
APPLES
AND
ORANGES
NOBODY
DISPUTES
THAT
HAS
MORE
BIG
OS
FEATURES
THE
QUESTION
IS
DOES
AN
INDIVIDUAL
NEED
THE
POWER
THE
SALES
OF
WINDOWS
VS
ANSWER
THAT
QUESTION
THE
NEXT
QUESTION
IS
EVEN
IF
I
DID
WANT
TO
RUN
AND
I
HAD
THIS
BIG
MONSTER
MACHINE
TO
RUN
IT
ON
IS
THERE
A
DIVERSE
SET
OF
APPLICATIONS
TO
RUN
ON
IT
THAT
ALLOW
ME
TO
PRODUCTVIELY
DO
MY
WORK
GO
TO
YOUR
LOCAL
COMPUTER
STORE
TO
ANSWER
THIS
ONE
I
THINK
THE
COMPARISON
YOU
NEED
TO
BE
DOING
IS
NT
VS
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
NEW
BATTLE
LINES
WILL
BE
DRAWN
WINDOWS
HAS
WON
THE
SINGLE
USER
PC
WAR
THE
NEXT
ONE
WILL
BE
THE
CLIENT
SERVER
WAR
AND
THE
ENTRIES
ARE
NT
UNIX
AND
NETWARE
GRANTED
THESE
OSS
WILL
BE
EVENTUALLY
SCALED
DOWN
TO
BE
ATTRACTIVE
TO
THE
SINGLE
USER
PC
AND
THAT
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
PHASE
II
OF
THE
WAR
WHO
WINS
ONLY
THE
MARKETPLACE
WILL
TELL
BUT
IT
SURE
IS
FUN
WATCHING
AND
ARGUING
ABOUT
IT
