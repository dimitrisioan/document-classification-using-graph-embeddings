i
often
use
notepad
to
view
and
print
readme
type
files
i
often
find
myself
rushing
to
get
to
print
manager
to
stop
the
printer
and
delete
the
file
from
the
print
queue
because
ive
forgotten
to
reset
the
print
margins
from
inches
left
and
right
to
inches
the
resulting
printed
text
looks
all
chopped
up
because
of
the
hard
returns
in
the
source
file
i
struggled
with
the
margin
problem
for
ages
as
well
until
i
finally
got
hold
of
the
shareware
binary
editor
and
dug
into
notepadexe
there
is
no
setup
facility
to
force
notepad
to
default
to
margins
its
hardwired
into
code
do
a
search
for
then
change
the
offending
bytes
to
et
viola
who
are
the
guys
who
hardcode
these
options
anyway
im
interested
in
whether
the
problem
only
rears
its
ugly
head
for
certain
printers
im
using
an
old
epson
or
is
that
never
can
remember
aloha
