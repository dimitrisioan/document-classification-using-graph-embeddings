IN
ARTICLE
JESSE
WRITES
HI
HAVE
YOU
USED
MAC
SYSTEM
OR
IF
THE
ANSWER
IS
POSITIVE
YOU
WOULD
KNOW
IF
MSWINDOWS
IS
A
MATURE
OS
THIS
IS
SILLY
IS
UNIX
A
MATURE
OS
DEPENDS
ON
WHO
YOU
ASK
AND
HOW
YOU
DEFINE
MATURE
SYSTEM
IS
IF
ANYTHING
LESS
MATURE
THAN
WINDOWS
DAYS
AGO
PEOPLE
DOUBTED
THAT
MSWINDOWS
IS
NOT
A
REAL
OS
I
CAN
SEE
WHY
THEY
HAVE
SUCH
QUESTION
MSWINDOWS
CONFUSES
MANY
PEOPLE
MICROSOFT
SIMULATED
MAC
BUT
IT
DID
A
LOUSY
JOB
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
CAN
NOT
CREATE
HIERARCHY
GROUPS
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
CREATE
A
GROUP
IN
A
GROUP
IF
YOU
KNOW
HOW
PLEASE
TELL
ME
SO
WHY
DO
YOU
NEED
SOMETHING
LIKE
BEHIERARCHIC
TO
CREATE
GROUPS
UNDER
THE
APPLE
MENU
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
APPLE
MENU
ITEMS
ARE
A
RIPOFF
OF
THE
PROGRAM
MANAGER
IF
YOU
WANT
A
HIERARCHIC
PROGRAM
LAUNCHER
THERE
ARE
LOTS
AVAILABLE
UNCOMPLETE
DOCUMENTATION
ITS
NOT
EASY
TO
FIND
THE
REASON
WHY
CAUSES
AN
UNPREDICTABLE
ERROR
AND
THIS
IS
EASY
ON
A
MAC
GIVE
ME
A
BREAK
HAVING
SPENT
HOURS
MOVING
SYSTEM
EXTENSIONS
AROUND
AND
RESTARTING
THE
MAC
TO
SEE
WHY
A
CERTAIN
APP
CRASHES
ALL
THE
TIME
I
FIND
THIS
LAUGHABLE
GROUP
DELETINGFILE
DELETING
AFTER
DELETING
A
GROUP
USERS
HAVE
TO
USE
FILE
MANAGER
TO
DELETE
FILES
BUT
IF
USERS
FORGET
TO
DELETE
SOME
RELATED
FILES
THE
DISK
WILL
BE
FULL
OF
NONSENSE
FILES
OH
GREAT
EVER
HEAR
OF
ALIASES
WONDER
WHY
APPLE
IMPLEMENTED
THEM
SHARE
PROBLEM
ONCE
YOU
CREATE
TWO
WINDOWS
DOING
COMPILATION
AND
EDITING
IN
SOME
LANGUAGE
WO
GOOD
EDITOR
THERE
WILL
BE
A
SHARING
PROBLEM
YOU
JUST
CAN
NOT
OPEN
OR
SAVE
THE
PROGRAM
IF
IT
IS
LOADED
IT
MAKES
SENSE
TO
PREVENT
FROM
SAVING
BUT
NOT
OPENING
EH
I
DONT
FOLLOW
ITS
BY
NO
MEANS
EASY
TO
SATISFY
EVERYBODY
BUT
IF
MICROSOFT
WANT
TO
KEEP
THEIR
REPUTATIONS
THEY
SHOULD
EVALUATE
THE
USER
INTERFACE
MORE
CAREFULLY
BEFORE
PRODUCTS
DISTRIBUTE
WHY
IS
IT
THAT
I
FIND
THE
MAC
DESKTOP
INCREDIBLY
ANNOYING
WHENEVER
I
USE
IT
NO
FLAME
PLEASE
YEAH
RIGHT
YOU
POST
FLAME
