while

i
installed
spss
for
windows
as
part
of
an
evaluation
once
the
evaluation
was
complete
i
duly
deleted
the
software
from
my
pc
unfortunately
there
is
still
a
ghost
of
spss
left
when
i
run
something
like
write
and
go
to
embed
an
object
then
spss
chart
appears
on
the
list
of
objects
im
offered
i
looked
around
all
the
obvious
ini
files
without
success
the
next
thing
i
tried
was
looking
for
the
string
spss
chart
in
every
file
in
the
windows
directory
it
turned
up
in
a
file
called
reqdat
or
regdat
unfortunately
the
file
was
binary
and
so
i
didnt
feel
inclined
to
edit
it
id
welcome
a
solution
for
removing
spss
from
the
list
of
ole
servers
i
think
you
can
do
this
with
regedit
which
can
make
changes
to
the
ole
registration
database
from
program
manager
or
file
manager
choose
run
and
type
regedit
you
do
have
it
its
included
with
windows
but
not
well
documented
