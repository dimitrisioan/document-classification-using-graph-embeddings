MARK
WOODRUFF
WROTE
THIS
MORNING
AT
AM
WHILE
I
WAS
WORKING
ON
MY
RESEARCH
PAPER
I
HAD
TO
REBOOT
A
HUNG
DOS
PROGRAM
THAT
DID
NO
DISK
IO
FROM
WITHIN
WINDOWS
WHEN
MY
MACHINE
FINISHED
REBOOTING
I
FOUND
MY
WINDOWS
DIRECTORY
AND
ABOUT
TWO
THIRDS
OF
MY
OTHER
DIRECTORIES
WERE
IRREVERSIBLY
CORRUPTED
STUFF
DELETED
THIS
SOUNDS
LIKE
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
MY
HD
A
MONTH
AGO
MY
HD
WAS
STACKED
WITH
STACKER
I
RUN
SUDDENLY
EVERYTHING
HUNG
UP
AND
MOST
OF
THE
HD
GOT
CORRUPTED
DIRECTORIES
CHANGED
INTO
UNREADABLE
FILES
WITH
FUNNY
NAMES
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IT
IS
PROBABLY
JUST
THE
DOUBLEDISK
PART
OF
THAT
IS
TROUBLESOME
I
NOW
USE
STACKER
V
AND
SO
FAR
I
HAVE
HAD
NO
TROUBLE
DOES
THIS
NEED
TO
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
DISK
COMPRESSION
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
THE
SAME
THING
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
MYSELF
BUT
WITHOUT
ANY
DISK
COMPRESSION
STUFF
INSTALLED
FOR
EXAMPLE
GUESS
WHAT
HAPPENED
WHEN
