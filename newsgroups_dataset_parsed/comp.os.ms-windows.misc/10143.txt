WRITES
ON
MY
PC

ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY
RUN
WINDOWS

ONLY
DOS
BASED
APPLICATION

PROCOMMPLUS
IN
MY
CONFIGSYS
I
HAVE
LOADED
WITH
THE
OPTION
NOEMS
NO
EXPANDED
MEMORY
FOLLOWING
A
THREAD
IN
ONE
OF
THE
COMP
NEWSGROUPS
I
READ
THAT
IT
WAS
NO
NECESSARY
TO
HAVE
LOADED
INDEED
IN
THE
MANUAL
IT
SAYS
THAT
IS
USED
TO
GET
EXPANDED
MEMORY
OUT
OF
EXTENDED
MEMORY
SINCE
I
HAVE
THE
NOEMS
OPTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
DEVICE
IS
USELESS
IN
MY
CASE
SHOULD
I
USE
OR
SHOULD
I
REMOVE
IT
FROM
MY
CONFIGSYS
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
HELP
ERIC
NOEMS
ENABLES
THE
SYSTEM
TO
USE
THE
UPPER
MEMORY
BETWEEN
AND
THATS
A
GOOD
PLACE
FOR
DEVICE
DRIVERS
DOS
KERNAL
ETC
KEEP
IT
IN

THOUGHT
THAT
HIGHMEMSYS

DO

IM
STILL
LOADING
MY
OTHER
DRIVERS
HIGH
MOUSE

HAVENT
CHECKED
MEMC

I
BELIEVE
I
HAVE
MANAGED
TO
LOAD
THEM
HIGH
IE
BETWEEN
AND
ALSO
EVER
SINCE
I
TOOK
OUT
WINDOWS
LOADS
SLIGHTLY
FASTER

MEG
RAM

I
GOT
RID
OF
MY
CTRLALT
DEL
REBOOT
PROBLEM
BEFORE
THE
COMPUTER
WOULD
NOT
REBOOT
USING
CTRLALTDEL
AFTER
EXITING

WOULD
REALLY
LIKE

MY
CONFIGSYS
