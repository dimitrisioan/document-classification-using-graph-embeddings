on
my
pc
i
almost
exclusively
run
windows
the
only
dos
based
application
i
have
is
procommplus
in
my
configsys
i
have
loaded
with
the
option
noems
no
expanded
memory
following
a
thread
in
one
of
the
comp
newsgroups
i
read
that
it
was
no
necessary
to
have
loaded
indeed
in
the
manual
it
says
that
is
used
to
get
expanded
memory
out
of
extended
memory
since
i
have
the
noems
option
it
seems
to
me
that
the
device
is
useless
in
my
case
should
i
use
or
should
i
remove
it
from
my
configsys
thanks
for
your
help
eric
noems
enables
the
system
to
use
the
upper
memory
between
and
thats
a
good
place
for
device
drivers
dos
kernal
etc

it
in
well

thought
that
highmemsys

do
that
too

just
took
out
of
my
configsys
and
im
still
loading
my
other
drivers

havent
checked

believe
i
have
managed
to
load
them
high
ie
between
and
also
ever
since
i
took
out
windows

slightly
faster

get
about
extra
meg
of
freemem
in
windows
im
running
enhanced
with
meg
ram

swap
and
i
got

of
my
ctrlalt
del
reboot
problem
before
the
computer
would
not
reboot
using
ctrlaltdel
after
exiting

would
really
like

of
my
configsys
