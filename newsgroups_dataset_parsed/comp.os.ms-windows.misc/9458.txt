PROBLEMS
HELP
I
AM
WORKING
ON
A
PROJECT
THAT
INVOLVES
USING
TEXT
WITH
FOREIGN
LANGUAGE
CHARACTERS
IN
THIS
CASE
NORWEGIAN
I
HAVE
BEEN
MANIPULATING
THE
DATA
WITH
EXCELL
AND
THEN
EXPORTING
THE
DATA
AS
COMMA
SEPERATED
VARIABLE
FILES
TO
AN
WORKSTATION
THE
NORWEGIAN
CHARACTERS
SHOW
UP
FINE
UNDER
WINDOWS
BUT
APPEAR
AS
FUNNY
CHARACTERS
ON
THE
WORKSTATION
THE
WORKSTATION
IS
SETUP
FOR
NATIONAL
LANGUAGE
SUPPORT
AND
WE
HAVE
PROBLEM
ENTERING
THE
NORWEGIAN
CHARACTERS
FROM
THE
WORKSTATION
KEYBOARD
ON
FURTHER
INVESTIGATION
I
FOUND
THAT
THE
CHARACTER
CODES
USED
BY
WINDOWS
ARE
DIFFERENT
FOR
THESE
CHARACTERS
THAN
THOSE
SPECIFIED
BY
THE
MSDOS
CODE
PAGE
THE
MSDOS
CODES
SEEM
TO
BE
THE
SAME
AS
THE
WORKSTATION
WHAT
GIVES
AND
HOW
CAN
GET
AROUND
IT
PLEASE
REPLY
BY
EMAIL
AS
I
WILL
BE
OUT
OF
THE
OFFICE
THE
NEXT
FEW
DAYS
AND
WILL
NOT
BE
READING
THE
NEWS
THANKS
