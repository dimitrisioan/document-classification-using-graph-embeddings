if

your

file
remains
mb

on

are
you
running
more
applications
than
you
really
need
to
at
the

time
this
is
of
course
not
true
the
temporary
swap
file
is
purged
every
time
you
exit
windows
the
permanent
file
is
permanent
and
can
only
be
changed
by
adjusting
the
virtual
memory
i
suspect
that
either
the
original
poster
was
tinkering
and
adjusted
the
swap
file
to
and
then
forgot
about
it
or
somebody
helped

when
i
first
setup
windows
using
the
self
load
mode
it
grabbed
about
megs
of
swap
file
space
my
meg
hd
was
nearly
empty
at
that
time
i
deleted
windows
for
a
time
and
recently
reloaded
now
my
hd
is
nearly
full
and
windows
just
took
megs
i
have
read
somewhere
that
the
best
rule
of
thumb
is
have
your
permanent
swap
file
the
same
size
as
your
regular
ram
size
i
have
megs
of
ram
and
windows
took
meg
perm
swap
file
works
very
well
in
fact
with
my
available
hd
space
about
megs
it
wont
let
me
make
the
swap
file
any
bigger
you
should
change
your
virtual
mem
swap
file
to
megs
i
think
that
is
what
you
said
your
ram
was
