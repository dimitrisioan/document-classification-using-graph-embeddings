ANYBODY
SEEN
MOUSE
CURSOR
DISTORTION
RUNNING
THE
DIAMOND
DRIVER
SORRY
DONT
KNOW
THE
VERSION
OF
THE
DRIVER
NO
INDICATION
IN
THE
MENUS
BUT
ITS
A
RECENTLY
DELIVERED
GATEWAY
SYSTEM
AM
GOING
TO
TRY
THE
LATEST
DRIVERS
FROM
DIAMOND
BBS
BUT
WONDERED
IF
ANYONE
ELSE
HAD
SEEN
THIS
AS
A
FOLLOWUP
THIS
IS
A
COWORKERS
MACHINE
HE
HAS
THE
LATEST
DRIVERS
IT
ONLY
HAPPENS
USING
THE
DRIVER
SOMETIMES
IT
TAKES
A
MINUTE
OR
SO
FOR
THE
CURSOR
TO
WIG
OUT
BUT
IT
EVENTUALLY
DOES
IN
THIS
MODE
I
SUSECT
SOMETHING
IS
STEPPING
ON
MEMORY
THE
VIDEO
CARD
WANTS
I
EXCLUDED
IN
THE
LINE
AND
IN
SYSTEMINI
THE
PROBLEM
PERSISTED
PERHAPS
IT
IS
SOMETHING
SPECIFIC
TO
THE
GATEWAY
MACHINE
OR
ITS
COMPONENTS
IT
IS
A
EISA
BUS
WITH
AN
ULTRASTORE
CONTROLLER
AH
WELL
I
WAS
HOPING
THIS
WAS
SOME
KIND
OF
KNOWN
PROBLEM
OR
SOMEBODY
HAD
SEEN
IT
BEFORE
PERHAPS
A
CALL
TO
GATEWAY
IS
IN
ORDER
BUT
I
DO
FIND
FOLKS
HERE
USUALLY
ARE
FAR
MORE
IN
THE
KNOW
DON
LINDBERGH
I
HAVENT
SEEN
THIS
PARTICULAR
PROBLEM
BUT
ANOTHER
PLACE
YOU
MIGHT
CHECK
IS
IF
YOUR
BIOS
IS
DOING
VIDEO
SHADOWINGDIAMOND
WANTS
THAT
TURNED
OFF
THAT
MIGHT
CAUSE
A
MEMORY
CONFLICT
AS
WELL
GOOD
LUCK
HOPE
