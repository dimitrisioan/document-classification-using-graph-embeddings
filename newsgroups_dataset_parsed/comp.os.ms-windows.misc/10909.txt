WRITES
I
JUST
RECEIVED
A
GATEWAY
WITH
WINDOWS
AND
DOS
I
RAN
IT
A
FEW
TIMES
WITH
NO
APPARENT
PROBLEMS
I
DECIDED
TO
GIVE
DOUBLE
SPACE
A
TRY
AFTER
COMPRESSING
THE
DRIVE
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
I
DECIDED
TO
LOAD
WINDOWS
IT
TOOK
MINUTE
SECONDS
TO
LOAD
AFTER
DBLSPACE
SECONDS
BEFORE
DBLSPACE
I
TINKERED
A
LITTLE
WITH
THE
MACHINE
AND
NOTICED
AN
ERROR
MESSAGE
SAYING
SMARTDRIVE
CANNOT
WORK
WITH
DBLSPACE
NOT
UNREASONABLE
SINCE
THE
SMARTDRV
PACKAGED
WITH
DOS
IS
VERSION
MAKE
SURE
THAT
ALL
YOUR
DRIVERS
HIMEM
SMARTDRV
ARE
BEING
EXECUTED
FROM
THE
DOS
DIRECTORY
LOSS
OF
THE
CACHE
PROVIDED
BY
SMARTDRV
COULD
BE
YOUR
PROBLEM
IF
NOT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
MIGHT
CAUSE
THE
STARTUP
DELAY
MY
TESTBED
FOR
DBLSPACE
WHICH
HAS
A
VERY
MINIMAL
AMOUNT
OF
DATA
ON
THE
DISK
SO
THAT
I
DONT
EAT
UP
TOO
MUCH
TIME
AS
I
INSTALL
AND
UNINSTALL
DBLSPACE
BOOTS
IN
ABOUT
SECONDS
FROM
THE
STARTING
MSDOS
HERALD
TO
THE
END
OF
THE
AUTOEXECBAT
EXECUTION
I
DONT
HAVE
HANDY
A
SYSTEM
WITH
A
MORE
REALISTIC
VOLUME
OF
DATA
TO
TIME
