yes
and
it
is
the
fastest
defrag
ive
ever
watched
it
did
a
hard
disk
in
minutes
i
found
the
ms
defrag
looks
very
much
like
norton
speedisk
is
it
just
a
stripdown
version
of
the
later
i
have
both
norton
speedisk
and
backup
so
i
was
wondering
if
i
need
to
install
ms
backup
richard
yes
defragger
is
come
from
norton
if
you
have
norton
utility
dont
bother
dont
bother
if
you
have
cpbackup
or
fastback
they
all
offer
options
not
available
in
the
strippeddown
ms
version
from
cps
examples
no
proprietary
format
to
save
space
probably
no
direct
dma
access
and
no
tape
drive
you
need
ms
defrag
if
you
use
doublespace
to
work
on
the
compressed
volume
