the
next
question
is
even
if
i
did
want
to
run
and
i
had
this
big
monster
machine
to
run
it
on
is
there
a

i
think
youre
deliberatly
overstating
the
requirements
for
considering
that
is
a
multithreaded
true
multitasking
os
and
takes
the
place
of
dos
and
windows
and
more
i
actually
think
the
requirements
for
are
very
reasoable
i
also
think
that
anyone
using
windows
without
megs
of
ram
a
and
megs
of
hard
drive
space
is
beating
their
head
against
a

those
are
also

the
requirements
for
windows

are
about
equal

natural
progress
of
things
is
for
government
to
gain
ground
and
for
liberty
to
yield
