DAVE
LAUDICINA
ONCE
WROTE
MICROSOFT
IS
THE
LARGEST
SOFTWARE
COMPANY
ON
THE
PLANET
YET
I
CANNOT
THINK
OF
EVEN
ONE
COMPUTING
CONCEPT
THAT
THEY
INNOVATED
AND
BROUGHT
TO
MARKET
BEFORE
ANYONE
ELSE
XEROXPARCAPPLE
OSBORNE
NEXT
GNU
AND
OTHERS
HAVE
BEEN
PIONEERS
AND
LED
THE
WAY
TO
THE
FUTURE
OF
COMPUTING
WHAT
HAS
MICROSOFT
DONE
TO
BE
A
TECHNOLOGICAL
LEADER
I
POSTED
THIS
QUESTION
BEFORE
BUT
I
GOT
NARY
A
REPLY
I
MAKE
THE
CHALLENGE
NOW
TO
ANYONE
WHO
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
SOMETHINGESPECIALLY
MICROSOFT
EMPLOYEES
I
GET
NO
RESPONSE
THIS
TIME
I
GUESS
IT
PRETTY
MUCH
ASSURES
ME
THAT
THERE
IS
NONEWHICH
IS
WHAT
I
SUSPECT
ANYWAY
REALLY
WHEN
YOU
COME
DOWN
TO
IT
WHO
CARES
I
JUST
HOPE
MS
KEEPS
DOING
WHAT
THEY
DO
BEST
GETTING
USABLE
PRODUCTIVE
SOFTWARE
TO
THE
MASSES
PERSONALLY
ILL
BE
BLASPHEMOUS
AND
SAY
THAT
IF
MICROSOFT
KEEPS
DOING
WHAT
IT
DOES
SO
WELL
I
HOPE
TO
SEE
MUCH
HARSHERSTRICTER
COPYRIGHT
AND
PATENT
LAWS
FOR
COMPUTER
ALGORITHMS
CONCEPTS
INTERFACES
AND
OTHER
INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTIES
TO
PROTECT
REAL
INNOVATORS
ID
HATE
TO
BE
ONE
WHO
ACTUALLY
DOES
INNOVATE
AND
THEN
HAVE
MICROSOFT
COME
IN
LIKE
A
HUGE
VULTURE
AND
USE
THEIR
BRUTE
MASS
DEVELOPMENT
STAFF
MARKETING
ETC
TO
GET
FAT
OFF
OF
MY
INNOVATION
I
DONT
HAVE
ALL
THAT
MUCH
SYMPATHY
FOR
APPLES
COMPLAINT
AGAINST
MICROSOFT
SINCE
THEY
JUST
TOOK
THE
IDEAS
FROM
XEROXS
PA
RESEARCH
CENTER
WHEN
THE
FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT
FORCED
XEROX
TO
DISCLOSE
THEIR
PATENTS
OVER
ANTITRUST
FEARS
HOWEVER
FOR
OTHER
COMPANIES
AND
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
HAVE
A
GREAT
IDEA
YET
GET
IT
BORROWED
BY
LARGER
CORPORATIONS
WHO
CAN
AFFORD
TO
QUICKLY
BRING
IT
TO
MARKET
WITHOUT
ANY
LICENSING
FROM
THE
ORIGINAL
INNOVATOR
I
FEEL
MUCH
SYMPATHY
LARRY
LARRY
WEEKS
THOSE
WHO
FIGHT
MONSTERS
SHOULD
MAKE
SURE
THAT
DEVECNPURDUEEDU
IN
THE
PROCESS
HE
DOES
NOT
BECOME
A
MONSTER
AND
WHEN
YOU
LOOK
LONG
INTO
AN
ABYSS
THE
ABYSS
ALSO
LOOKS
INTO
YOU
