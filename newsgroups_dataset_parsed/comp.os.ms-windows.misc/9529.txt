hi
well
im
searching
for
the
mswindows
logo
u
know
the
picture
when
u
start
windows
in
some
suitable
graficsformat
like
gif
or
jpg
cwindowssystemvgalogorle
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
rle
is
a
compressed
bmp
format
an
is
readable
by
wingif
paintshop
pro
paint
and
god
knows
how
many
other
programs
that
isnt
enough
to
change
your
windows
startup
logo
vgalogorle
is
not
needed
after
you
have
installed
windows
it
is
incorporated
as
a
part
of
wincom
to
make
a
new
wincom
you
have
to
concatinate
three
files
together
using
the
b
option
for
a
binary
concatonation
i
beleive
it
is
copy
b
wincnfvgalogolgovgalogorle
mywincom
make
sure
you
backup
your
wincom
file
in
anotehr
directory
before
you
do
this
i
absentmindedly
typed
wincom
instead
of
mywincom
and
had
to
resinstall
windows
anyway
substitute
whatever
rle
file
you
want
the
wincnf
has
the
info
needed
to
start
windows
think
of
it
as
a
bootstrap
and
vgalogovga
has
video
information
just
make
sure
that
the
rle
file
doesnt
tip
the
whole
com
file
size
over
the
limit
of
a
com
file
so
anyway
i
use
mywincom
to
startup
ms
windows
now
instead
of
that
annoying
microoft
advertisment
i
have
the
joker
yes
from
batman
taking
yoru
picture
from
the
screen
saying
smile
also
a
little
bit
of

microoft
windows
the

i
added
that
because
of
the
frequency
