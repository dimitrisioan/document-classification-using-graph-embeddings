WE
HAVE
A
LAN
WHERE
WE
ARE
DOING
DEVELOPMENT
ON
PRODUCT
FOR
MULTIPLE
PLATFORMS
FOR
THE
MOMENT
WE
ARE
ONLY
WORKING
ON
MAC
AND
DOSWINDOWS
THE
DEPARTMENT
HAS
ALWAYS
USED
SNEAKER
NET
TO
TRANSPORT
FILES
TO
THE
MAC
SINCE
IT
REQUIRES
A
FILTER
TO
STRIP
OUT
THE
LF
CHARACTERS
UNTIL
RECENTLY
NO
ONE
CONCIDERED
USING
ANY
VERSION
CONTROL
TO
MEDIATE
AND
AS
A
RESULT
THE
PROGRAMMERS
SPENT
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
TIME
MERGING
FILES
TOGETHER
AT
THE
END
OF
EACH
WEEK
SO
THAT
A
NEW
SYSTEM
COULD
BE
BUILD
WE
ARE
NOW
TRYING
TO
STREAMLINE
THIS
PROCESS
BUT
ARE
HAMPERED
BY
THE
LACK
OF
SOFTWARE
THAT
WILL
ALLOW
US
TO
SHARE
FILES
ACROSS
PC
AND
MAC
PLATFORMS
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
PVCS
USED
TO
DO
THIS
BUT
THAT
THEY
NO
LONGER
SUPPORT
THE
MAC
PRODUCT
ANYONE
KNOW
WHY
POLYTRON
I
HAVE
SEEN
PEOPLE
ASK
ABOUT
DEVELOPMENT
IN
MULTIPLE
PLATFORMS
SO
I
ASSUME
THAT
OURS
IS
NOT
A
NEW
PROBLEM
WHO
HAS
HAD
TO
DEAL
WITH
IT
WHAT
SOLUTIONS
HAVE
YOU
COME
UP
WITH
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
FOR
ANY

ALL

THERE
