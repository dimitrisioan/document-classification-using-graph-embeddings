i
have
an
eisa
machine
and
i
just
do
not
understand
why
most
eisa
video
cards
only
match
the
performance
of
their
isa
counterparts
for
instance
the
eisa
orchid
pro
designer
iise
is
only
about
as
fast
as
the
isa
diamond
speedstar
plus
which
isnt
what
i
would
call
fast
i
dont
understand
why
eisa
video
cards
arent
as
a
group
on
the
same
level
of
performance
as
local
bus
cards
given
that
eisa
video
cards
have
a
bit
bus
to
move
data
around
instead
of
isas
bits
good
question
answer
the
eisa
bus
does
move
bits
rather
than
isas
but
it
still
moves
it
at
about
the
speed
as
the
isa
bus
i
think
thats
either
or
mhz
the
local
bus
designs
also
move
bits
like
the
eisa
but
they
move
the
data
at
the
cpu
speed
up
to
mhz
so
on
a
cpu
the
local
bus
is
moving
data
at
mhz
and
the
eisa
is
moving
data
at
or
mhz
so
the
local
bus
should
be
to
times
faster
than
eisa
on
a
mhz
cpu
eisa
should
be
about
two
maybe
times
as
fast
as
isa
i
would
expect
the
eisa
board
to
be
more
than
twice
as
fast
as
the
isa
board
not
only
are
you
moving
data
on
a
path
twice
as
wide
at
least
but
there
is
a
difference
in
the
number
of
clocks
required
for
bus
transactions
between
the
two
busses
most
isa
boards
require
multiple
clocks
per
bus
transaction
typically
this
is
around
eisa
boards
are
suppose
to
be
able
to
burst
at
a
rate
so
i
would
expect
performance
to
be
that
of
an
isa
card
so
i
guess
for
me
the
question
is
unanswered
still
i
would
expect
him
to
be
able
to
see
a
speed
difference
and
he
apparently
does
not
insisting
on
perfect
safety
is
for
people
who
dont
have
the
balls
to
live
in
the
real
world
