CODA
MUSIC
FINALE
AND
PETRUCCI
FONT
PROBLEM
IVE
BEEN
USING
FINAL
FROM
CODA
FOR
SOME
TIME
BUT
SUDDENLY
IT
STOPPED
USING
MY
FONTS
I
HAVE
A
PC
WITH
LOTS
OF
DISK
SPACE
AND
MEMORY
A
POSTSCRIPT
LASER
FINALE
AND
I
RECENTLY
INSTALLED
ATM
IVE
BEEN
FIDDLING
AROUND
WITH
THE
WINDOWS
SETUP
FOR
SOME
TIME
AND
WHEN
I
NEEDED
TO
DO
SOME
WORK
WITH
FINALE
THINGS
DIDNT
PRINT
PROPERLY
IT
MIGHT
AND
IT
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
INSTALLATION
OF
ATM
FROM
TO
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
OLD
ATM
LYING
AROUND
ANOMORE
THE
MOST
ANNOYING
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
THE
PETRUCCI
FONT
DIDNT
PRINT
WHICH
IS
A
RATHER
IMPORTANT
FONT
I
MANAGED
TO
GET
DIRECT
PRINTING
TO
WORK
IF
I
INCLUDED
IN
THE
FINALE
SECTION
OF
WININI
BUT
COMPILE
POSTSCRIPT
LISTING
STILL
DOESNT
WORK
AND
ITS
THOSE
EPS
FILES
I
NEED
WHEN
I
LOOK
AT
THE
EPS
FILES
GENERATED
THE
ONLY
FONT
WHICH
APPEARS
THERE
IS
COURIER
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
IF
I
MANUALLY
CHANGED
THE
COURIER
TO
PETRUCCI
IN
THE
EPS
FILE
EVERYTHING
WORKED
OK
BUT
ID
RATHER
AVOID
THAT
SINCE
I
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
SONGS
TO
WORK
WITH
AND
YES
IN
THE
SPECIALFONTFONT
NAMES
DIALOG
BOX
ALL
THE
FONTS
I
NEED
ARE
LISTED
WITH
THE
CORRECT
MAPPING
BETWEEN
FINALE
SCREEN
AND
PRINTER
FONTS
FINALE
IS
OBVIOUSLY
AWARE
OF
THE
FONTS
SINCE
DIRECT
PRINTING
OF
A
SCORE
WORKS
WELL
THAT
IS
AFTER
I
INCLUDED
AND
ALL
MY
OTHER
WINDOWS
APPLICATIONS
PRINT
PETRUCCI
AND
THE
OTHER
FONTS
WELL
