coda
music
finale
and
petrucci
font
problem
ive
been
using
final
from
coda
for
some
time
but
suddenly
it
stopped
using
my
fonts
i
have
a
pc
with
lots
of
disk
space
and
memory
a
postscript
laser
finale
and
i
recently
installed
atm
ive
been
fiddling
around
with
the
windows
setup
for
some
time
and
when
i
needed
to
do
some
work
with
finale
things
didnt
print
properly
it
might
and
it
might
not
have
anything
to
do
with
the
installation
of
atm
from
to
but
i
dont
have
the
old
atm
lying
around
anomore
the
most
annoying
problem
was
that
the
petrucci
font
didnt
print
which
is
a
rather
important
font
i
managed
to
get
direct
printing
to
work
if
i
included
in
the
finale
section
of
winini
but
compile
postscript
listing
still
doesnt
work
and
its
those
eps
files
i
need
when
i
look
at
the
eps
files
generated
the
only
font
which
appears
there
is
courier
i
found
out
that
if
i
manually
changed
the
courier
to
petrucci
in
the
eps
file
everything
worked
ok
but
id
rather
avoid
that
since
i
have
a
lot
of
songs
to
work
with
and
yes
in
the
specialfontfont
names
dialog
box
all
the
fonts
i
need
are
listed
with
the
correct
mapping
between
finale
screen
and
printer
fonts
finale
is
obviously
aware
of
the
fonts
since
direct
printing
of
a
score
works
well
that
is
after
i
included
and
all
my
other
windows
applications
print
petrucci
and
the
other
fonts
well
has
anyone
encountered
problems
like
this
what
is
the
current
version
of
finale
from
coda
music
software
i
have
are
the
people
at
coda

internet
or
id
be
grateful
for
all
hints
