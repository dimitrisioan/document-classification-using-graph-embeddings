DEAR
FRIEND
THE
RISC
MEANS
REDUCED
INSTRUCTION
SET
COMPUTER
THE
RISC
USUALLY
HAS
SMALL
INSTRUCTION
SET
SO
AS
TO
REDUCE
THE
CIRCUIT
COMPLEX
AND
CAN
INCREASE
THE
CLOCK
RATE
TO
HAVE
A
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
YOU
CAN
READ
SOME
BOOKS
ABOUT
COMPUTER
ARCHITECTURE
FOR
MORE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
RISC
HMM
NOT
THAT
I
AM
AN
AUTHORITY
ON
RISC
BUT
I
CLEARLY
REMEMBER
READING
THAT
THE
INSTRUCTION
SET
ON
RISC
CPUS
IS
RATHER
LARGE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
IN
ADDRESSING
MODES
RISC
INSTRUCTION
SETS
ARE
NOT
AS
ORTHOGONAL
IS
CISC
I
HOPE
THIS
WILL
CLEAR
IT
UP
TAKEN
FROM
ONE
OF
MY
LECTURE
NOTES
THE
ALTERNATIVE
APPROACH
TO
CISC
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
ADOPTED
BY
MANY
IN
RECENT
YEARS
HAS
COME
TO
BE
KNOWN
AS
RISC
THE
REDUCED
INSTRUCTION
SET
COMPUTER
THIS
CAN
BE
CHARACTERISED
SIMPLY
AS
SIMPLER
IS
FASTER
BY
SIMPLIFYING
THE
DESIGN
EG
BY
REDUCING
THE
VARIETY
OF
INSTRUCTIONS
ADDRESSING
MODES
THE
HARDWARE
CAN
BE
DESIGNED
TO
RUN
FASTER
EVEN
AT
THE
COST
OF
NEEDING
MORE
INSTRUCTIONS
THE
SAME
TASK
CAN
BE
DONE
MORE
QUICKLY
BY
THE
SIMPLER
FASTER
DESIGN
A
TYPICAL
RISC
PROCESSOR
WILL
O
PROVIDE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
REGISTERS
EG
O
PERFORM
ALL
DATA
OPERATIONS
ON
REGISTERS
O
PROVIDE
FEW
ADDRESSING
MODES
EG
IMMEDIATE
OR
REGISTER
OFFSET
O
ONLY
ALLOW
LOAD
STORE
OPERATIONS
TO
ACCESS
MEMORY
O
ONLY
USE
A
FEW
INSTRUCTION
FORMATS
O
ONLY
SUPPORT
A
FEW
DATA
TYPES
EG
INTEGER
UNSIGNED
FLOATING
