for
my
microsoft

dos
apps
i
had
to
use
the
driver
that
came
with
windows
version
didnt
allow
me
to
do
it
for
some
reason
for
logitech
rodents
use
the
lmouse
driver
that
comes
with
windows
also
you
need
to
be
using
a
video
driver
that
supports
use
of
the
mouse
both
the
vga
and
supervga
that
come
with
windows

support
it
both
of
these
are

if
youre
lucky
the
manufacturer

might
have
a
