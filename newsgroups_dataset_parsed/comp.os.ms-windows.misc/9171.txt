KURT
NAGEL
WRITES
HI
IM
HAVING
A
PROBLEM
WITH
AMIPRO
WHEN
WRITING
EQUATIONS
IF
THE
EQUATION
EXTENDS
PAST
A
CERTAIN
POINT
ON
A
LINE
THE
WHOLE
THING
DISAPPEARS
IF
I
THEN
TRY
TO
DELETE
THE
EQUATION
OR
CURSOR
BEYOND
THE
EQUATION
AMI
GOES
NUTS
THE
LINE
COUNTER
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
SCREEN
INCREMENTS
REPEATEDLY
AND
THE
ONLY
WAY
OUT
IS
TO
CTRLATLDEL
IF
I
HAVE
BEEN
UNFORTUNATE
ENOUGH
TO
SAVE
A
DOCUMENT
WITH
ONE
OF
THESE
SCREWED
UP
EQUATIONS
THE
DOCUMENT
IS
BASICALLY
TRASHED
ALTHOUGH
I
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
FIX
THEM
BY
GOING
INTO
AN
ASCII
EDITOR
AND
DELETEING
LARGE
CHUNKS
OF
THE
DOCUMENT
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
EXPERIENCED
THIS
DOES
LOTUS
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
AND
OR
HAVE
A
PATCH
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
KURT
NAGELFIDOCOLORADOEDU
I
CONTACTED
LOTUS
ABOUT
THIS
PROBLEM
TODAY
IT
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
PREVIOUSLY
AND
THERE
IS
A
FIX
APPARANTLY
THE
PROBLEM
ONLY
OCCURS
WHEN
TAB
CHARACTERS
ARE
USED
IMMEDIATELY
PRECEDING
THE
EQUATION
FRAME
THE
WORK
AROUND
WHEN
EQUATIONS
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
TOUCH
THE
RIGHT
MARGIN
IS
TO
DELETE
AT
LEAST
ONE
PRECEDING
TAB
AND
USE
SPACE
TO
ALIGN
THE
FRAME
OR
USE
SET
FRAME
WHERE
PLACED
WNO
TEXT
WRAP
AROUND
UNFORUTNATELY
ONCE
THE
PAGE
RUNON
HAS
OCCURED
YOU
ARE
HOSED
SO
THE
MORAL
OF
THE
STORY
IS
USE
ONLY
SPACE
CHARACTERS
TO
ALIGN
EQUATION
FRAMES
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
THE
REST
OF
YOU
WHO
HAVE
ALREADY
CONTACTED
ME
WITH
THIS
PROBLEM
