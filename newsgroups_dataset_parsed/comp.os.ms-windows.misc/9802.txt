AM
ASKING

YOUR
COLLECTED
WISDOM

HELP
ME
DECIDE
WHICH
PRINTER
I
SHOULD
PURCHASE
THE
CANON
BUBBLEJET
VS
THE
HP
DESKJET
I
THOUGHT
RATHER
THAN
TRUST
THE
SALESPERSON
I
WOULD
BENEFIT
MORE
FROM
RELYING
ON
THOSE
WHO
USE
THESE
PRINTERS
DAILY
AND
USE
THEM
TO
THEIR
FULLEST
POTENTIAL
AND
I
FIGURE
ALL
OF
YOU
WILL
KNOW
THEIR
BENEFITS
AND
PITFALLS
BETTER
THAN
ANY
SALESPERSON
NOW
I
WOULD
GREATLY
APPRECIATE
ANY
INFORMATION
YOU
COULD
RENDER
ON
THE
DPI
OF
THE
CANON
BUBBLEJET
VS
THE
HEWLETTPACKARD
DESKJET

WHICH
IS
FASTER
IS
THERE
A
NOTICEABLE
PRINT
QUALITY
DIFFERENCE
PARTICULARLY
IN
GRAPHICS
WHICH
WILL
HANDLE
LARGE
DOCUMENTS
BETTER
PAGES
OR
MORE
ANY
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
ON
EITHER
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED

WHICH
WORKS
BETTER
UNDER
WINDOWS
ANY

ETC
COST
OF
MEMORY

ETC
BASICALLY
