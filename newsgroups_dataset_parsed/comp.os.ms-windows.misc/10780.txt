RE
CHALLENGE
TO
MICROSOFT
SUPPORTERS
LOTS
OF
STUFF
DELETED
BECAUSE
I
FELT
LIKE
IT
THIS
MS
BASHING
HAS
DEFINITELY
LOST
ALL
ITS
HUMOR
VALUE
I
THINK
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
POSTING
ARE
FORGETTING
THAT
MOST
USERS
OF
MS
PRODUCTS
DO
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
ABOUT
INTERNET
AND
UNIX
IS
THAT
VERY
UNFRIENDLY
PLACE
WHERE
BIZZARE
ABREVIATIONS
REPLACE
THE
RATHER
COMFORTABLE
ABREVIATIONS
THEY
KNOW
AND
THE
ABREVIATIONS
HAVE
SUBTLE
DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN
THE
DIFFERENT
VENDORS
WHILE
PC
USERS
TEND
TO
CUSTOMIZE
ANY
WINDOWING
SETUP
THEY
CAN
NOT
DO
MUCH
WITH
THEIR
COMMAND
LINE
SO
TO
MOST
OF
THE
COMPUTER
USERS
IN
THE
WORLD
MS
PRODUCT
SYMBOLIZE
QUALITY
MS
HAS
MADE
THEIR
LIFE
EASIER
AND
MORE
PRODUCTIVE
AND
TO
THEM
THAT
IS
QUALITY
THEY
DO
NOT
CARE
ABOUT
WHAT
INNOVATIVE
THINGS
MS
HAS
DONE
OTHER
THAN
TO
MAKE
THEIR
LIFE
WITH
A
COMPUTER
ONE
HECK
OF
A
LOT
EASIER
YOU
MAY
KNOW
BETTER
THAN
MOST
COMPUTER
USERS
IN
THIS
WORLD
BUT
THAT
WILL
NOT
CHANGE
THEIR
PERCEPTION
FACE
IT
UNTIL
UNIX
COME
UP
WITH
A
DECENT
GUI
THAT
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
ALL
VARIATIONS
OF
UNIX
IT
JUST
WILL
NOT
CATCH
ON
WITH
THE
MAINSTREAM
OF
COMPUTER
USERS
WE
HERE
ON

ARE
