disk
maxtor
group
files
get
corrupted
on
a
regular
basis
only
happens
on
this
drive
d
had
only
one
corrupt
file
in
over
a
year
and
it
was
under
the
control
of
winword
on
c
disk
access
and
smartdrive
are
off
since
installation
of
dblspace
problem
has
turned
from
an
annoyance
to
a
reason
for
murder
are
you
using
fastopen
if
you
are
disable
it
we
had
a
lot
of
problems
with
fastopen
corrupting
weird
things
including
the
windows
permanent
swap
file
when
we
were
using
it
since
the
most
frequent
files
corrupted
are
the
grp
files
are
these
the
last
thing
written
to
when
exitting
windows
indeed
they
are
advanced
personal
measure
tells
me
they
are
accessed
just
before
shelldll
also
are
there
any
pdshareware
utilities
available
that
do
a
more
thorough
job
than
dos
ndd
etc
dos

really
like
