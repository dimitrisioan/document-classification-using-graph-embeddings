i
noticed
ati
had
posted
beta
avi
drivers
for
their
boards
on
compuserve
has
anyone
had
the
chance
tgo
try
them
how
well
do
they
work
very
well
indeed
at
home
a
vl
bus
version
of
the
graphics
pro
i
can
stretch
an
avi
window
to
and
it
will
continue
to
play
back
smoothly
it
drops
a
few
more
frames
but
on
most
machines
even
attempting
such
a
thing
would
mean
one
frame
update
every
seconds
an
isa
graphics
was
able
to
do
zoom
by
without
any
perceptible
performance
penalty
it
is
the
best
performance
ive
seen
so
far
with
the
possible
exception
of
an
intel
indeo
board
which
uses
overlay
so
it
doesnt
have
to
move
the
decompressed
data
over
the
isa
bus
at
any
point
