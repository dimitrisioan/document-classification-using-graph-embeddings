AN
AMIGA
USER
BY
DAY
I
WORK
WITH
WINDOWS
ID
BE
MUCH
MORE
COMFORTABLE
IN
WINDOWS
IF
I
HAD
TWO
THINGS
A
GOOD
PERSONAL
INFORMATION
MANAGER
YOU
KNOW
A
CALENDAR
ADDRESS
BOOK
REMINDER
LIST
ETC
ROLLED
INTO
ONE
CLEAN
INTERFACE
A
GOOD
FILE
MANAGER
MICROSOFTS
IS
VERY
POOR
BY
MY
STANDARDS
HOW
ABOUT
ONE
THAT
HAS
A
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
WINDOW
AND
ALLOWS
FILE
OPERATIONS
BETWEEN
THEM
BEING
ABLE
TO
LAUNCH
PROGRAMS
FROM
THE
SAME
INTERFACE
WOULD
BE
NICE
AS
WELL
AS
TEXT
READING
AND
GRAPHICS
VIEWING
THOSE
WHO
ARE
FAMILIAR
WITH
DIRECTORY
OPUS
ON
THE
AMIGA
KNOW
WHAT
IM
LOOKING
FOR
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
THE
FILE
MANAGER
HFM
WICH
HAS
TWO
WINDOWS
WHICH
COMPARE
THE
FILES
IN
TWO
DIRECTORYS
TO
FIND
OUT
WETHER
THERE
ARE
EQUAL
OR
SIMILAR
FILES
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
OPERATIONS
COPY
MOVE
DELETE
SHOW
THE
FILE
START
A
PROGAM
NAVIGATE
IN
THE
DIRECTORY
TREE
CAN
BE
INVOKED
BY
DRAGGING
A
DIRECTORY
ENTRY
WITH
THE
MOUSE
THIS
IS
VERY
CONVENIENT
BECAUSE
THE
SELECTION
OF
THE
FILE
AND
THE
OPERATION
TO
BE
PERFORMED
OCCUR
IN
ONE
MOVE
FOR
BITMAP
GRAPHIC
VIEWING
THE
PROGRAM
VPIC
CAN
BE
INTEGRATED
FOR
SPREADSHEAT
AND
DATABASE
FILES
I
USE
THE
VIEW
PROGRAM
FROM
PCTOOLS
HFM
CAN
BE
CONFIGURED
TO
USE
ARBITRARY
VIEWERS
TO
SHOW
SPECIAL
DATA
FORMATS
IT
DOES
ALSO
PRESENT
ARCHIVES
FROM
PKZIP
ETC
AS
SIMULATED
SUBDIRECTORYS
THIS
FILEMANAGER
HAS
A
SOMEWHAT
NON
STANDART
USER
INTERFACE
BUT
IT
IS
VERY
CONVIENIENT
TO
USE
AND
IS
THE
PREFERED
FILE
MANAGER
IN
SEVERAL
LABS
IN
OUR
UNIVERSITY
THE
DRAWBACK
OF
THIS
FILEMANAGER
IS
ITS
STILL
A
DOS
PROGRAM
AND
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
A
WINDOWS
VERSION
HAS
NOT
YET
BEGUN
I
USE
THE
PROGRAM
PACKAGE
WHERE
RUN

ITS
WINDOWS
COMPANION
SCHEDEXE
WHICH
WINDOWS
PROGRAM
SHOULD
BE
STARTED
IN
THIS
WAY
YOU
CAN
START
A
WINDOWS
PROGRAM
FROM
A
DOSBOX
THE
NEW
VERSION
TO
BE
RELEASED
SOON
INCLUDES
A
NEW
COMMAND
FOR
AUTOMATING
THIS
WINDOWS
PROGRAM
START
