I
GUESS
THATS
WHY
THERE
ARE
SO
MANY
NEW
DOS
AND
APPLICATIONS
COMING
AND
HARDLY
ANY
WINDOWS
APPS
COMING
OUT
IRONY
YEP
THE
APPS
ARE
COMMING
THE
APPS
ARE
COMMING
YET
ANOTHER
MICROMINION
HOPING
THAT
IF
HE
SAYS
SOMETHING
LONG
ENOUGH
HEY
I
REMEMBER
THE
GOOD
OLD
DAYS
RUNNING
ALPHA
WITH
BRIEF
EXCEL
WORD
AND
A
COUPLE
INTERNAL
APPS
PRODUCT
SUPPORT
DATABASE
CLIENT
EMAIL
FRONTEND
LIFE
WAS
GOOD
BUT
IT
WAS
ALSO
IMPRACTICAL
CAUSE
THE
MASSES
WERE
USING
WINDOWS
AND
MY
JOB
WAS
TO
HELP
THE
MASSES
APPARENTLY
YOU
PREFER
TO
WINDOWS
OR
AT
LEAST
DID
TO
WINDOWS
YES
BY
YOU
LAST
COMMENT
DO
YOU
MEAN
THAT
YOUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
IS
DATED
IT
MUST
BE
OR
ARGUE
ITS
DEFINITELY
DATED
I
USED
ALPHA
WHEN
MSFT
WAS
DEVELOPING
IT
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THE
MASSES
WERE
USING
WINDOWS
BECAUSE
THEY
COULDNT
AFFORD
TO
USE
CAN
YOU
SAY
AS
MUCH
FOR
NT
I
PREFERRED
WINDOWS
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
MORE
STABLE
FASTER
THAN
BUT
COULD
STILL
RUN
MORE
APPS
THAN
AGAIN
I
MADE
THIS
CHOICE
BEFORE
WAS
RELEASED
BUT
GETTING
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
DO
YOU
HAVE
ANY
DATA
ON
THE
RELATIVE
AVALIABLITY
OR
WINDOWS
APPLICATIONS
VERSUS
APPLICATIONS
OR
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
STATED
SUPPORT
WILL
BE
DROPPED
BY
ANY
OF
THE
ABOVE
NO
IVE
SEEN
NO
SUCH
DATA
GROW
UP
OTHER
COMPANIES
ARE
SUPPORTING
MAKE
POINTS
PLEASE
IF
YOU
SEE
LIFE
IN
TERMS
OF
DEBATING
POINTS
I
THINK
YOU
NEED
TO
GROW
UP
AH
YES
I
REMEMBER
THE
DAYS
WHEN
WE
KIDS
WOULD
ENGAGE
IN
ORDERLY
DEBATE
BUT
OUR
PARENTS
WOULD
USUALLY
FIND
OUT
AND
FORCE
US
TO
ACT
IN
THE
MORE
MATURE
MANNER
OF
HEAPING
INVECTIVE
AND
CASTING
ROCKS
AND
DIRT
CLODS
HEE
HEE
GOOD
ONE
IT
DOESNT
HELP
MICROSOFT
TO
HAVE
EMPLOYEES
I
ASSUME
YOU
ARE
DUE
TO
THE
ORG
MAY
BE
WRONG
SAYING
SUCH
TRIVIAL
THINGS
ON
THE
NET
SO
MICROSOFT
EMPLOYS
OVER
EMPLOYEES
WALKING
INTO
THIS
PLACE
IS
NOT
LIKE
WALKING
INTO
THE
COMMERCIAL
THERE
ARE
INDIVIDUALS
HERE
YOU
THINK
THEYLL
ALL
TALK
THE
SAME
WAY
SAY
THE
SAME
THING
AND
HELP
MICROSOFT
ALL
THE
TIME
IF
SO
WHY
IT
APPEARS
TO
ME
THAT
HE
IS
VOICING
HIS
FRUSTRATION
TO
AN
ATTITUDE
HE
HAS
ENCOUNTERED
BEFORE
AND
ONE
THAT
IVE
ENCOUNTERED
AS
WELL
I
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HAVE
HAD
NO
SUCH
EXPERIENCE
OTHER
THAN
FROM
READING
THIS
THREAD
YOU
AT
MICROSOFT
ARE
IN
A
UNIQUE
POSITION
TO
PRESENT
FACTS
HMM
ARE
YOU
SURE
IM
SPEAKING
FROM
MY
OWN
EXPERIENCE
AS
AN
USER
CERTAINLY
PEOPLE
IN
SAY
THE
NT
MARKETING
GROUP
WOULD
BE
IN
A
UNIQUE
POSITION
TO
PRESENT
THE
RESULTS
OF
SAY
RESEARCH
ON
UPCOMING
NT
AND
APPS
VS
WINDOWS
AND
MSDOS
APPS
PART
OF
MY
POINT
WAS
THAT
JUST
CAUSE
ONE
WORKS
AT
MICROSOFT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
ONE
HAS
ACCESS
TO
SUCH
DATA
IF
IT
EXISTS
BUT
PREFER
TO
MAKE
BASELESS
CLAIMS
OR
ATTACK
TO
POSTER
I
MUST
MAKE
THE
SAME
CONCLUSION
AS
HE
I
WILL
CONFESS
TO
AT
TIMES
ATTACKING
THE
POSTER
USENET
ACCOUNTS
ARE
NOT
RESTRICTED
TO
THE
MARKETROIDS
THEYRE
OPEN
TO
ANY
FULLTIMER
AND
ARE
PRIMARILY
FOR
RECREATIONAL
PURPOSES
YEAH
SOME
OF
US
ARE
LIKELY
TO
ANSWER
A
QUESTION
OR
HOP
INTO
A
DEBATE
OR
MAKE
STUPID
COMMENTS
YOU
KNOW
LIKE
HUMAN
BEINGS
IM
SORRY
THIS
NEWSGROUP
IS
ONLY
FOR
OPRESSED
HACKERS
AND
STRANDED
EXTRATERRESTRIALS
NOT
HUMANS
HOW
ABOUT
ALTMICROSOFTHUMANS
YOU
SEEM
TO
DISCOUNT
OTHERS
ANYWAY
AGAIN
MY
POINT
WAS
THAT
NOT
ALL
MICROSOFTIES
ARE
HERE
TO
SELL
READERS
ON
OUR
PRODUCTS
WHICH
WOULD
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
NOADS
PHILOSOPHY
OF
USENET
NOR
DO
WE
NECESSARILY
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
INFO
THAT
OTHERS
HAVE
I
ALSO
GET
TIRED
OF
PEOPLE
ASSUMING
THAT
MICROSOFTIES
ARE
LIKE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
BORG
JEN
