windowsay
v
which
has
few
child
windows

etc
the

shows
up
with
all
its
children
fine
now
i
create
another
childt
with
a
wsthickframe
style
and
placed
on
top
of
one
or
more
of
its
siblings
style
wsthickframe
is
used
so
that
i
can
resize
it
how
do
i
make
sure
that
the
child
t
will
always
be
at
the
top
of
its
siblings
i
used
setwindowpos
and
bringwindowtotop
without
success
whats
happening
is
that
while
i
am
resizing
t
it
shows
up
but
as
soon
as
i
let
go
it
goes
behild
its
siblings

window
is
probobly
on
top
but
the
lower
