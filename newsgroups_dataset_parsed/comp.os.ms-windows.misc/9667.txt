QUICKEN
VS
TOBIAS
MANAGING
YOUR
MONEY

MICHAEL
WIESENBERG
WROTE
I
JUST
GOT
A
COPY
OF
TOBIAS
MANAGING
YOUR
MONEY
I
HAVE
QUICKEN
AND
ITS
WONDERFUL
FOR
SOME
THINGS
BUT
MYM
SEEMS
TO
HAVE
SOME
FEATURES
THAT
DOESNT
FOR
EXAMPLE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
HANDLE
MONTHLY
AUTOMATIC
DEDUCTIONS
FROM
A
CHECKING
ACCOUNT
YOU
KNOW
A
MONTHLY
PAYMENT
THAT
GETS
ELECTRONICALLY
DEDUCTED
EVERY
MONTH
FROM
MY
CHECKING
ACCOUNT
OR
IS
THERE
SOMETHING
THAT
IM
NOT
DOING
RIGHT
AND
CAN
ACTUALLY
DO
THAT
HI
I
HAVE
NEVER
USED
MYM
SO
I
CAN
NOT
HELP
YOU
WITH
THE
COMPARISON
OF
THE
TWO
PRODUCTS
I
AM
HOWEVER
A
DEVOTED
QUICKEN
USER
AND
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
HOW
TO
SET
UP
THE
WEEKLY
MONTHLY
QUARTERLY
YEARLY
TRANSACTIONS
FIRST
USE
THE
MEMORIZE
FEATURE
CTRLM
TO
RECORD
THE
RECURRING
TRANSACTIONS
NEXT
DEFINE
A
TRANSACTION
GROUP
WHICH
USES
THESE
MEMORIZED
TRANSACTIONS
AND
SPECIFY
THE
FREQUENCY
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
USED
IE
MONTHLY
QUICKEN
WILLCAN
NOT
AUTOMATICALLY
MAKE
THE
TRANSACTIONS
FOR
YOU
BUT
NOW
ALL
YOU
DO
IS
RECALL
THE
GROUP
AND
ALL
OF
THE
INDIVIDUAL
TRANSACTIONS
WILL
BE
ENTERED
AT
ONCE
ADDITIONALLY
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
THE
BILL
MINDER
IT
WILL
REMIND
YOU
WHEN
EACH
TRANSACTION
GROUP
IS
DUE
FOR
EXAMPLE
YOU
COULD
HAVE
THREE
TRANSACTION
GROUPS
ONE
FOR
PAYMENTS
AT
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
MONTH
MIDDLE
OF
THE
MONTH
AND
ONE
FOR
QUARTERLY
PAYMENTS
I
HOPE
THIS
HELPS
MIKE
