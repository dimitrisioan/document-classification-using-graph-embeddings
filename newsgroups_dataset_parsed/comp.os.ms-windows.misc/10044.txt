for
any

you
can
print
to
a
file
from
an
hp
or
any
other
printer
just
go
into
the
printers
section
of
your
control
panel
select
the
printer
you
want
to
redirect
to
a
file
and
click
on
connect
then
choose
file
as
the
port
to
connect
the
printer
to
when
you
print
from
any
application
to
that
printer
windows
will
prompt
you
for
a
file
name
for
the
file
into
which
you
want
to
capture
the
printout
its
pretty
easy
