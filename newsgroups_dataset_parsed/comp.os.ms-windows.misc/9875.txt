HELLO
WINNETTERS
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
DISCUSSION
HEREIN
ON
THE
RELATIVE
MERITS
OF
MS
ACCESS
AND
BORLAND
PARADOXWIN
HOWEVER
ARE
THERE
ANY
USERS
OUT
THERE
WITH
EXPERIENCE
WITH
THE
DATABASE
PACKAGE
CALLED
APPROACH
IT
HAS
GOTTEN
A
NUMBER
OF
VERY
GOOD
REVIEWS
FROM
THE
VARIOUS
MAGS
AND
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
IT
WOULD
REQUIRE
LESS
HARDWARE
OVERHEAD
THAN
PARADOX
I
HAVE
RULED
OUT
ACCESS
BECAUSE
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
IT
ARE
EXTREMELY
NONINTUITIVE
EG
REQUIRING
A
FIELD
TO
ALWAYS
HAVE
A
VALUE
I
LIKE
WHAT
IVE
SEEN
OF
PARADOX
BUT
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
THE
RESOURCE
REQUIREMENTS
ARE
GREATER
THAN
WHAT
I
HAVE
MHZ
MB
RAM
SO
PLEASE
PROVIDE
ME
WITH
YOUR
THOUGHTS
ARE
APPROACH
GOOD
AND
BAD
THANKS
RICHARD
