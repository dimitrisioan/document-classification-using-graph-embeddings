character
missing
in
ttf
word
doesnt
show
the
periodcentred
character
to
indicate
spaces
if
i
use
the
ttfonts
from
coreldraw
our
editors
need
to
be
able
to
see
how
many
spaces
are
in
text
but
the
character
displayed
is
a
large
hollow
box
they
overlap
each
other
and
characters
on
each
side
which
is
useless
i
believe
the
character
used
by
is
the
periodcentred
this
character
shows
up
with
the
windows
charmap
display
as
the
hollow
box
which
tends
to
confirm
this
i
have
edited
the
corel
font
with
fontmonger
and
changing
the
font
graphics
for
the
character
makes
no
difference
to
the
font
output
in
charmap
or
altering
the
paragraph
or
cedilla
does
alter
their
font
graphics
displayed
however
is
the
character
used
to
indicate
spaces
the
periodcentred
character
has
anyone
been
able
to
get
this
character
displayed
from
a
coreldraw
