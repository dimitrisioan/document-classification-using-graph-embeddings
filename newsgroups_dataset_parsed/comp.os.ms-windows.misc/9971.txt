RE
WHY
IS
MY
MOUSE
SO
JUMPY
MS
MOUSE
ECKTONSUCSBYUEDU
SEAN
ECKTON
WRITES
I
HAVE
A
MICROSOFT
SERIAL
MOUSE
AND
AM
USING
MOUSECOM
WAS
USING
I
THINK
BUT
SWITCHED
TO
TO
SEE
IF
IT
WAS
ANY
BETTER
VERTICAL
MOTION
IS
NICE
AND
SMOOTH
BUT
HORIZONTAL
MOTION
IS
SO
BAD
I
SOMETIMES
CANT
CLICK
ON
SOMETHING
BECAUSE
MY
MOUSE
JUMPS
AROUND
I
CAN
BE
MOVING
THE
MOUSE
TO
THE
RIGHT
WITH
RELATIVELY
UNIFORM
MOTION
AND
THE
MOUSE
WILL
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
TO
THE
RIGHT
THEN
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
AGAIN
MAYBE
THIS
TIME
TO
THE
LEFT
ABOUT
INCH
THIS
IS
CRAZY
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
SO
MUCH
TROUBLE
WITH
A
MOUSE
BEFORE
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
SOLUTIONS
TRY
THIS
FLIP
YOUR
MOUSE
OVER
AND
OPEN
UP
THE
COVER
THAT
HOLDS
THE
MOUSE
BALL
IN
PLACE
REMOVE
THE
BALL
AND
INSIDE
YOU
SHOULD
SEE
PROBABLY
ROLLERS
IF
ANY
OF
THE
ROLLERS
HAVE
A
TINY
LAYER
OF
CAKEDON
DIRT
DUST
OR
OTHERWISE
UNIDENTIFIABLE
SCUM
ON
THEM
CAREFULLY
SCRAPE
IT
OFF
WITH
A
SMALL
KNIFE
XACTO
WORKS
GREAT
BE
CAREFUL
YOU
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
GAUGE
THE
ROLLERS
JUST
CLEAN
OFF
THE
DIRT
PUT
THE
BALL
BACK
IN
PUT
THE
COVER
ON
AND
THERE
YOU
ARE
I
CLEAN
A
COUPLE
OF
DOZEN
OF
THESE
EVERY
MONTH
HERE
ANOTHER
SYMPTOM
IS
THAT
WHEN
YOU
MOVE
THE
MOUSE
IT
SEEMS
TO
CLICK
ALONG
IF
THIS
DOESNT
SOLVE
YOUR
PROBLEM
AT
LEAST
YOU
HAVE
A
CLEAN
MOUSE
I
HIGHLY
RECOMMEND
USING
A
PROPER
SOFT
MOUSE
PAD
AND
IF
YOU
ARE
A
CLEAN
FREAK
PLACE
IT
IN
YOUR
DRAWER
EVERY
NIGHT
OR
WHEN
YOU
DONT
USE
IT
TO
KEEP
THE
DUST
OFF
PERSONALLY
I
PREFER
TRACK
BALLS
OH
WHICH
BRINGS
ME
TO
ANOTHER
POINT
IF
YOUR
MOUSE
OR
TRACKBALL
TRACKS
OPTICALLY
AND
THE
SUNLIGHT
IS
STREAMING
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW
ONTO
YOUR
MOUSETRACKBALL
YOU
MAY
NOTICE
THAT
IT
WILL
STOP
WORKING
IF
THIS
HAPPENS
TO
YOU
CLOSE
THE
CURTAINS
OR
BLINDS
OR
SIMPLY
SHADE
YOUR
POINTING
DEVICE
AND
SEE
IF
THAT
HELPS
