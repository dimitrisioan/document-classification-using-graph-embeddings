useful
and

need
to
do
a
lot

looking
before

figure
out
how
the
stuff
is
stored
general
primer
word
for
windows
stores
its
data
in
two
chunks
the
first
chunk
is
the
actual
text
in
the
file
this
is
all
stored
together
and
has
nothing
but
text
and
graphics
the
second
chunk
is
the
formatting
information
for
general
use
to
read
a
word
for
windows
file
skip
the
first
bytes
of
the
file
its
a
general
header
then
read
the
remaining
text
until
you
hit
binary
data
