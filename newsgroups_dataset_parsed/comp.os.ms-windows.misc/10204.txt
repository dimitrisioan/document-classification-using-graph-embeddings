HAVE
BEEN
HAVING
A

WITH
MY

IT
ONLY
OCCURS
WHEN

THEREFORE
CANNOT
BE

ITS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
BUS
MICE
ARE
MORE
ACCURATE
AND
STABLE
IN
GENERAL
THAN
SERIAL
MICE
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
ITS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
DIFFERENCES
IN
HOW
THE
INTERRUPTS
ARE
HANDLED
AS
WELL
AS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
MOUSE
DATA
IS
RECEIVED
OVER
THE
COMPUTER

AS
OPPOSED
