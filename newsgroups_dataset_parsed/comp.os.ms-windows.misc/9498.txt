IS
THERE
ANYONE
OUT

CHICAGO

IS
PROJECTED
TO
RUN
IN
ON
AND
HIGHER
IT
IS
DEFINITELY
AIMED
AT
THE

IT
IS
RUMORED
TO
OFFER
PREEMPTIVE
MULTITASKING
MULTITHREADING
BUT
WILL
NOT
OFFER
MULTIPROCESSING
IS
BIT
AND
NO
RELIANCE
ON
DOS
IT
IS
RUMORED
TO
HAVE
AN
INTEGRATED

CHICAGO
BUT
WITHOUT
THE
GUI
IS
ALSO
A
STEP
TOWARDS
CAIRO
THE
NEXT
