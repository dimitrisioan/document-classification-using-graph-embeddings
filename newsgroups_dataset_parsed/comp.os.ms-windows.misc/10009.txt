POSTSCRIPT
AT
DPI
USING
A
WINDOWS
PRINTER
DRIVER
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
PRINT
TO
A
FILE
WITH
OUTPUT
AS
A
POSTSCRIPT
FILE
LATER
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
TAKE
THIS
POSTSCRIPT
FILE
TO
A
MACHINE
WITH
AN
ATTACHED
HEWLETT
PACKARD
LASER
PRINTER
AND
PRINT
THE
DOCUMENT
AT
DOTS
PER
INCH
RESOLUTION
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
USE
THIS
METHOD
TO
PRINT
FROM
WORDPERFECT
FOR
WINDOWS
AND
FROM
AN
IMAGE
PROCESSING
PROGRAM
THAT
CAN
OUTPUT
IMAGES
IN
POSTSCRIPT
HERES
THE
PROBLEM
THE
WINDOWS
POSTSCRIPT
PRINTER
DRIVER
PSCRIPTDRV
DOESNT
ALLOW
ME
TO
SPECIFY
DPI
IN
FACT
THE
SETUP
DIALOG
FOR
THIS
DRIVER
DOES
HAVE
A
PULLDOWN
MENU
FOR
RESOLUTION
BUT
THE
ONLY
CHOICE
GIVEN
IN
THE
MENU
IS
NOT
A
REALLY
USEFUL
MENU
ANY
IDEAS
