WRITES
I
HAVE
A
MICROSOFT
SERIAL
MOUSE
AND
AM
USING
MOUSECOM
WAS
USING
I
THINK
BUT
SWITCHED
TO
TO
SEE
IF
IT
WAS
ANY
BETTER
VERTICAL
MOTION
IS
NICE
AND
SMOOTH
BUT
HORIZONTAL
MOTION
IS
SO
BAD
I
SOMETIMES
CANT
CLICK
ON
SOMETHING
BECAUSE
MY
MOUSE
JUMPS
AROUND
I
CAN
BE
MOVING
THE
MOUSE
TO
THE
RIGHT
WITH
RELATIVELY
UNIFORM
MOTION
AND
THE
MOUSE
WILL
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
TO
THE
RIGHT
THEN
MOVE
SMOOTHLY
FOR
A
BIT
THEN
JUMP
AGAIN
MAYBE
THIS
TIME
TO
THE
LEFT
ABOUT
INCH
THIS
IS
CRAZY
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
SO
MUCH
TROUBLE
WITH
A
MOUSE
BEFORE
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
SOLUTIONS
DOES
MICROSOFT
THINK
THEY
ARE
WHAT
EVERYONE
SHOULD
BE
JUST
VENTING
STEAM
I
THINK
I
HAVE
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
I
THINK
IT
IS
CAUSED
BY
THE
RUBBER
BALL
IN
THE
MOUSE
WHICH
DOESNT
ROLL
SO
SMOOTH
THE
DETECTORS
IN
THE
MOUSE
NOTICE
THIS
AND
WHOOPS
I
HIT
A
MINE
USING
MINESWEEPER
I
THINK
THE
SOLUTION
WILL
BE
BUYING
A
NEW
MOUSE
ANDOR
USING
A
MOUSE
PAD
