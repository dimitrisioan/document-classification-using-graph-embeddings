LOSING
DARK
COLORS
OF
MY
ICONS
HERE
IS
AN
ANNOYING
PROBLEM
WHENEVER
I
SAVE
AN
ICON
WHICH
CONTAINS
DARK
COLORS
LIKE
DARK
RED
OR
DARK
PURPLE
THESE
COLORS
ARE
CONVERTED
TO
THE
BRIGHT
COLORS
THIS
HAPPENS
WITH
EVERY
ICON
EDITOR
INCLUDING
THE
IMAGE
EDITOR
THAT
CAME
WITH
SDK
I
DONT
HAVE
THIS
PROBLEM
WITH
BMP
FILES
EITHER
ONLY
WITH
ICO
FILES
OR
ICON
LIBRARIES
THE
PROBLEM
IS
WITH
THE
ICON
COLORMAP
FIELD
IN
THE
ICON
FILE
HEADER
CHECKING
THE
FILE
WITH
A
BINARY
EDITOR
I
CAN
SEE
THAT
THE
MASKS
ARE
OK
BY
EDITING
THE
COLORMAP
MANUALLY
COPYING
FROM
ANOTHER
ICON
THAT
I
DIDNT
EDIT
I
CAN
FIX
THE
COLORS
DOES
ANYBODY
KNOW
WHAT
MAY
BE
CAUSING
THIS
PROBLEM
