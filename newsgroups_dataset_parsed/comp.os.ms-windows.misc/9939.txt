WRITES
IF
I
PUT
LASTDRIVE
Z
IN
MY
CONFIGSYS
NETX
WILL
RUN
BUT
I
CANT
ACCESS
DRIVE
F
TO
LOG
IN
TO
NOVELL
IF
I
DONT
PUT
LASTDRIVE
Z
IN
MY
CONFIGSYS
I
CANT
ACCESS
OTHER
DRIVES
FROM
THE
FILEMANAGER
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THERE
SHOULD
BE
A
WAY
TO
MAKE
NETX
WORK
WITH
THE
LASTDRIVE
STATEMENT
IN
MY
CONFIGSYS
FIRST
OFF
I
HAVENT
USED
BUT
I
THINK
THATS
ABOUT
TO
CHANGE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
LASTDRIVE
COMMAND
AND
THE
WAY
NETWARE
IN
GENERAL
AND
IN
THIS
CASE
NETX
IN
PARTICULAR
ADDS
DRIVES
TO
THE
DEVICE
CHAIN
SETTING
LASTDRIVEZ
MEANS
THERE
ARE
NO
UNASSIGNED
AS
OPPOSED
TO
UNUSED
DRIVE
LETTERS
FOR
NETWARE
TO
USE
AS
IT
TACKS
ITS
DRIVE
MAPPINGS
ONTO
THE
END
OF
THE
EXISTING
LIST
OF
DRIVES
OBVIOUSLY
ATTACHES
ITS
NETWORK
DRIVES
TO
EXISTING
UNUSED
DRIVE
LETTERS
ID
GUESS
THE
NEXT
THING
ID
TRY
IS
SOMETHING
LIKE
LASTDRIVEM
WHICH
ON
MOST
MACHINES
WILL
LEAVE
A
FAIR
SWATHE
OF
DRIVES
FOR
AND
STILL
ALLOW
UP
TO
NETWARE
DRIVE
MAPPINGS
AS
WELL
