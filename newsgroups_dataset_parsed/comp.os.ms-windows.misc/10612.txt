JEN
KILMER
WRITES
MUCH
BS
DELETED
FOR
BREVITY
AGAIN
MY
POINT
WAS
THAT
NOT
ALL
MICROSOFTIES
ARE
HERE
TO
SELL
READERS
ON
OUR
PRODUCTS
WHICH
WOULD
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
NOADS
PHILOSOPHY
OF
USENET
NOR
DO
WE
NECESSARILY
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
INFO
THAT
OTHERS
HAVE
IT
CERTAINLY
SMACKS
OF
THAT
REMEMBER
THE
POLL
THAT
YOU
QUOTED
SAYING
THAT
YOU
HAD
SEEN
A
OF
USERS
BEING
SATISFIED
WITH
DOS
CARE
TO
RECALL
HOW
UNBIASED
THE
SAMPLE
SET
WAS
THAT
POST
SURE
LOOKED
LIKE
FUDAND
COMING
FROM
A
MICROSOFTIE
WELL
IT
SURE
SEEMED
LIKE
SOMETHING
WAS
NOT
ON
LEVEL
ADVOCACY
IS
GOOD
BUT
SPREADING
FUD
TO
ADVOCATE
YOUR
FAVORITE
OS
IS
VERY
UNETHICAL
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
A
VESTED
INTEREST
IN
THE
SUCCESS
OF
THAT
OS
I
ALSO
GET
TIRED
OF
PEOPLE
ASSUMING
THAT
MICROSOFTIES
ARE
LIKE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
BORG
THAT
IS
BECAUSE
THEIR
ACTIONS
SEEM
TO
INVITE
THIS
OPINION
NEVER
SEEN
MORE
DEFENSIVE
PEOPLE
IN
MY
LIFE
MOREOVER
MANY
OF
THEIR
POSTS
SEEM
TO
ENCOURAGE
THIS
TOO
IMHO
SERIOUSLY
SPEAKING
IT
IS
A
SHAME
THAT
MS
TECHIE
EMPLOYEES
GET
THE
HEAT
FOR
MSS
ACTIONS
MOST
OF
WHICH
ARE
PERPETRATED
BY
THE
MANAGEMENT
AND
MARKETING
I
AM
SURE
THAT
THEY
ARE
VERY
TALENTED
ETC
I
HAVE
NOT
DOUBTS
ABOUT
THEIR
ABILITIES
JUST
ABOUT
THE
ETHICS
OF
THEIR
MARKETING
PRACTICES
DIVYA
DIVYA
LIVE
LONG
AND
THEN
DIE
A
SLOW
AND
HORRIBLE
DEATH
WHAT
CONFUCIUS
WANTED
TO
SAY
