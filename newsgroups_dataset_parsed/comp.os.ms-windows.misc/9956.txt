WELL
IM
AMAZED
AT
HOW
SUCCESSFUL
THIS
EXERCISE
WAS
I
RECEIVED
RESPONSES
AND
REQUESTS
FOR
SUMMARY
THANKS
TO
EVERYONE
WHO
MADE
IT
POSSIBLE
ON
MY
OWN
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
FIND
OUT
ABOUT
CODEBASE
ACCSYS
AND
QE
CODEBASE
AND
ACCSYS
ARE
C
LIBRARIES
WITHOUT
SQL
QE
IS
A
WINDOWS
APPLICATION
THAT
CAN
BE
COMMUNICATED
THROUGH
WINDOWS
DDE
CALLS
WHERE
YOU
SEND
A
SQL
STRING
AND
RECEIVE
THE
RESULTS
MOST
PEOPLE
WROTE
TO
TELL
ME
ABOUT
THE
PARADOX
ENGINE
FROM
BORLAND
OTHER
PRODUCTS
MENTIONED
WERE
MICROSOFTS
ODBC
ACCSYS
QUADBASE
CODEBASE
RBASE
AND
QE
ONLY
ODBC
QUADBASE
RBASE
AND
QE
HAVE
SQL
FOR
MYSELF
I
DECIDED
ON
CODEBASE
MOSTLY
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
AN
ANSI
C
PORTABILITY
VERSION
THAT
RUNS
UNDER
DOS
UNIX
ETC
AND
INCLUDES
THE
SOURCE
CODE
AND
PORTABILITY
IS
IMPORTANT
IN
MY
APPLICATION
IT
WORKS
WITH
DBASE
FOXPRO
OR
CLIPPER
FILES
HOWEVER
I
FEEL
THAT
MICROSOFTS
ODBC
LOOKS
VERY
PROMISING
ITS
MOSTLY
A
FORMALISATION
OF
BUILDING
AND
SUBMITTING
SQL
QUERIES
AND
FORMATTING
QUERY
RESULTS
AS
THE
RESPONSES
SAY
ITS
AVAILABLE
VIA
FTP
EXCEPT
ITS
EFFECTIVELY
UNUSUABLE
WITHOUT
TWO
MANUALS
THE
ODBC
PROGRAMMERS
REFERENCE
AND
THE
ODBC
SDK
GUIDE
MOREOVER
ODBC
DOESNT
ACTUALLY
INTERPRET
SQL
AND
LIASE
WITH
DATABASES
THATS
UP
TO
DRIVERS
THAT
SHOULD
BE
PROVIDED
BY
DATABASE
MANUFACTURERS
ALSO
ITS
WINDOWS
ONLY
ITS
ACTUALLY
AN
EXTENSION
TO
THE
WINDOWS
SDK
NEVERTHELESS
ITS
A
START
AT
A
SQL
INTERFACE
STANDARD
AND
SHOULD
MAKE
LIFE
INTERESTING
IN
THE
FUTURE
HERES
MY
ORIGINAL

FOLLOWED
BY
THE

SEPARATED

DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
BORLAND

HAVE

FOR

RESPECTIVE

ID
REALLY
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
BUILD
A

QUERY
STRING
AND
PASS
IT
TO
A
FUNCTION
WHICH
RETURNS
THE

IN
SOME
FORMAT
FAILING
THAT
ANY
OTHER

WOULD
STILL
BE
BETTER
THAN
NOTHING

ALSO
LIKE
TO
HEAR
OF
THIRD

DOING
THE

IF

PREPARE
