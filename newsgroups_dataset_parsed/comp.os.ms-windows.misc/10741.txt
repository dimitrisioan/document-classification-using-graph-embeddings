RE
CHALLENGE
TO
MICROSOFT
SUPPORTERS
THIS
IS
THE
PART
THAT
USUALLY
GETS
ME
WHILE
I
AM
SET
TO
MAKE
MONEY
THERE
USUALLY
ARE
OTHER
THINGS
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
AND
DEBATED
THAT
IS
THE
PURPOSE
OF
LIFE
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
STOCK
PRICES
AND
SALES
OF
A
PARTICULAR
PRODUCT
ARE
MEASURES
OF
SUCCESS
THEY
CAN
BE
MEASURES
OF
SHORT
TERM
OR
LONG
TERM
SUCCESS
I
THINK
IN
MS
CASE
THEY
ARE
A
GOOD
MEASURE
OF
THEIR
LONG
TERM
SUCCESS
THE
ORIGINAL
POST
MENTIONED
HOW
IT
SEEMS
ON
THIS
GROUP
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
ATTACKING
MS
AND
NOT
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
ANYTHING
POSITIVE
ABOUT
MS
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
MAKE
A
POINT
THAT
THE
ATTACKS
ARE
OVER
EMPHASIZED
AND
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
SALES
OF
MS
PRODUCTS
THEY
DEFINITELY
TELL
A
DIFFERENT
STORY
I
ALSO
THINK
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
THE
ATTACKERS
OR
DEBATERS
AS
YOU
CALL
THEM
ARE
HIGHLY
TECHNICAL
LOOK
AROUND
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
PEOPLE
DONT
WANT
TO
GREP
AND
AUCK
AND
LS
L
THEY
JUST
WANT
TO
PUSH
THE
BUTTONS
AND
GET
THEIR
JOB
DONE
ON
A
REASONABLY
PRICED
PIECE
OF
HARDWARE
THAT
DOES
NOT
NEED
A
COMPUTER
SMART
GUY
TO
LOAD
CONFIGURE
ETC
ETC
LIKE
IT
OR
NOT
MS
AND
THE
MULTITUDES
OF
BUSINESS
APPLICATIONS
THAT
EXIST
TO
RUN
UNDER
WINDOWS
DOES
THIS
AND
DOES
IT
WELL
WE
ARE
RUNNING
PCS
LOADED
WITH
A
COMPLETE
SUITE
OF
MOSTLY
MS
WINDOWS
APPLICATIONS
IN
AN
ADMINISTRATIVE
BUSINESS
FUNCTION
ON
A
NOVELL
NETWORK
RUNNING
ALL
SOFTWARE
OFF
THE
SERVER
IT
DOES
THE
JOB
QUITE
WELL
AND
IF
WE
HAD
IT
TO
DO
OVER
AGAIN
WE
WOULD
PICK
WINDOWS
AGAIN
AGAIN
I
REPEAT
TO
MS
KEEP
DOING
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
YOU
ARE
DOING
A
GREAT
JOB
FLAME
ON
THX
DAVE
