regarding
the
horror
stories
about
and
stacker
killing
hard
drives
i
was
wondering
if
the
dos
mirror
command
works
on
the
doubled
drive
info
as
well
as
the
normal
fat
table
and
partition
table
if
it
records
the
vital
doubledisk
info
then
using
it
daily
should
go
a
long
way
toward
protecting
yourself
against
the
type
of
catastrophic
failure
discussed
if
it
doesnt
then
shame
on
microsoft
mirror
is
one
of
those
dos
commands
that
didnt
survive
the
change
from
dos
its
been
dropped
along
with
backup
join
edlin
and
a
couple
other
crummy
old
dos
commands
you
can
still
use
the
commands
if
you
absolutely
have
to
but
they
are
not
included
on
the
distribution
disks
however
in
mirrors
case
im
certain
that
it
does
not
know
anything
about
doublespaced
drives
