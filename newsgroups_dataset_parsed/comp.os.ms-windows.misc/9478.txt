MORE
ON
PERMENENT

IM
SURE
EVERYONE
WHO
HAS
AN
UNCOMPRESSED
PART
OF
THEIR
COMPRESSED
HARD
DISK
HAS
SEEN
THE
MESSAGE
YOU
HAVE
SELECTED
A
SWAP

GREATER
THAN
THE
SUGGESTED

YOU
WANT
TO
CREATE
THIS
SWAP
FILE
ANYWAY
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WELL
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
ROBERT
CALLED
MICROSOFT
AND
ASKED
THEM
WHAT
AND
WHY
WHAT
THEY
SAID
IS
THAT
WINDOWS
CHECKS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
FREE
DISK
SPACE
AND
DIVIDES
THAT
NUMBER
BY
THEN
IT
CHECKS
FOR
THE
LARGEST
CONTIGUOUS
BLOCK
OF
FREE
DISK
SPACE
WINDOWS
THEN
SUGGESTS
THE
SMALLER
OF
THE
TWO
NUMBERS
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
UNDER
ABSOLUTELY
NO
CIRCUMSTANCESNONEWILL
WINDOWS
USES
A
SWAP
FILE
LARGER
THAN
THE
SUGGESTED
SIZE
WELLTHATS
WHAT
HE
SAID
I
CALL
BULL
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
WHY
DOES
WINDOWS
REPORT
THE
MEMORY
IS
AVAILABLE
TO
ME
IF
ITS
NOT
GOING
TO
USE
IT
I
THINK
THE
SUPPORT
DROID
WAS
MALFUNCTIONING
AND
CONFUSED
THE
DISK
SPACE
LIMIT
WITH
THE
VIRTUAL
ADDRESS
SPACE
LIMIT
AS
FAR
AS
THE
DISK
IS
CONCERNED
YOU
ARE
LIMITED
ONLY
BY
THE
AMOUNT
OF
CONTIGUOUS
FREE
SPACE
THE
LIMIT
THAT
CAUSES
THE
MESSAGE
WINDOWS
WILL
ONLY
USE
IS
THE
AMOUNT
OF
VIRTUAL
ADDRESS
SPACE
THAT
THE
VIRTUAL
MEMORY
MANAGER
WILL
CREATE
AND
THIS
IS
A
FUNCTION
OF
THE
AMOUNT
OF
FREE
MEMORY
THAT
YOU
HAVE
WHEN

THE

IS
COMPUTED

MULTIPLYING
