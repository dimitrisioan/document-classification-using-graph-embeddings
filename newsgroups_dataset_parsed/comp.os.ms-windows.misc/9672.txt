diamond
speedstar
driver
bug
since
swapping
out
my
generic
vga
card
for
a
diamod
speedstar
i
have
noticed
two
new
problems
if
i
create
a
windowed
msdos
session
mode
when
the
text
starts
to
scroll
rather
than
printing
characters
it
starts
to
print
horizontal
lines
that
spill
out
to
the
desktop
and
trash
the
entire
display
ctrlaltdel
terminates
the
dos
window
and
restores
the
desktop
after
a
short
time
in
ncds
pc
xremote
for
windows
all
characters
displayed
on
the
desktop
are
changed
to
be
unreadable
i
am
unable
to
restore
without
rebooting
these
are
in
both
and
color
drivers
large
and
small
fonts
dos
win
and
smartdrv
installed
i
like
the
speed
of
the
card
and
have
had
no
other
problems
any
ideas
thanks
