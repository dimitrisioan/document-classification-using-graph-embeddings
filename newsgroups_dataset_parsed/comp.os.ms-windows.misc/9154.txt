MARK
RAYMAKER
SAYS
IS
ANYONE
AWARE
OF
EXISTING
IPXNETX
SOFTWARE
FOR
WINDOWSNT
OR
IS
ATTACHMENT
TO
NETWARE
A
FUTURE
RELEASE
PLEASE
RESPOND
TO
INTERNET
MAIL
RAYMAKERBCMTMCEDU
THANKS
I
BELIEVE
THE
BETA
VERSION
OF
THE
SERVICE
IS
AVAILABLE
VIA
FTP
ON
FTPCICAINDIANAEDU
IN
CALLED
SOMETHING
LIKE
NWNTZIP
THERE
IS
AN
INDEX
ASCII
FILE
THERE
WHICH
LISTS
THE
PROGRAMS
IN
THAT
DIRECTORY
AND
WHAT
THEY
DO
UNFORTUNATELY
THIS
BETA
WILL
ALSO
DISABLE
NETBEUI
AND
TCPIP
OVER
YOUR
PRIMARY
NIC
SO
IF
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TO
RUN
IT
GET
YOURSELF
AN
EXTRA
NIC
AND
BIND
IT
TO
THAT
OTHERWISE
WAIT
FOR
NEXT
RELEASE
LIKE
I
AM
ADRIENE
