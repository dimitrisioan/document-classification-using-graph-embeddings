ONE

HAVING
AN
UNUSUAL
PROBLEM
IF
SHE

AN
ALTTAB
TO
A
FULLSCREEN
DOS
PROGRAM
WHEN
SHE
GOES
BACK
TO
WINDOWS
HER
DESKTOP
FONTS
HAVE
CHANGED
IF
SHE
GOES
BACK
TO
A
FULLSCREEN
DOS
PROGRAM
AND
THEN
GOES
BACK
TO
WINDOWS
THE
FONT
HAS
CHANGED
BACK
TO
ITS
DEFAULT
FONT
ITS
NOT
A
MAJOR
PROBLEM
EVERYTHING

THE

IS
LEGIBLE
BUT
IT
IS
ANNOYING
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEA
WHY
THIS
HAPPENS
BY

THAT
IT
ONLY
STARTED
HAPPENING
AFTER
I
USED
ICONTITLEFACENAME
IN
WININI
TO
CHANGE
THE
DESKTOP
FONT
TO
ARIAL
SO
I
STOPPED
EXITING
FROM
DOS
SESSIONS
WHILE
IN
FULLSCREEN
