WRITES
WHEN
I
FIRST
SETUP
WINDOWS
USING
THE
SELF
LOAD
MODE
IT
GRABBED
ABOUT
MEGS
OF
SWAP
FILE
SPACE
MY
MEG
HD
WAS
NEARLY
EMPTY
AT
THAT
TIME
I
DELETED
WINDOWS
FOR
A
TIME
AND
RECENTLY
RELOADED
NOW
MY
HD
IS
NEARLY
FULL
AND
WINDOWS
JUST
TOOK
MEGS
ONE
OF
THE
RULES
FOR
A
PERMANENT
SWAP
FILE
IS
THAT
IT
MUST
BE
CONTIGUOUS
NONFRAGMENTED
SPACE
I
SUSPECT
THAT
IS
MORE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
DIFFERENCE
THAN
THE
AMOUNT
OF
FREE
DISK
IN
YOUR
CASE
I
HAVE
READ
SOMEWHERE
THAT
THE
BEST
RULE
OF
THUMB
IS
HAVE
YOUR
PERMANENT
SWAP
FILE
THE
SAME
SIZE
AS
YOUR
REGULAR
RAM
SIZE
I
HAVE
MEGS
OF
RAM
AND
WINDOWS
TOOK
MEG
PERM
SWAP
FILE
WORKS
VERY
WELL
IN
FACT
WITH
MY
AVAILABLE
HD
SPACE
ABOUT
MEGS
IT
WONT
LET
ME
MAKE
THE
SWAP
FILE
ANY
BIGGER
YOU
SHOULD
CHANGE
YOUR
VIRTUAL
MEM
SWAP
FILE
TO
MEGS
I
THINK
THAT
IS
WHAT
YOU
SAID
YOUR
RAM
WAS
IT
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
YOU
ARE
RUNNING
WE
HAD
TO
INCREASE
OUR
SWAP
FILE
I
THINK
IT
IS
NOW
WHEN
SOME
APPLICATIONS
COULDNT
RUN
WITHOUT
EVERYTHING
ELSE
