startup
brad
what
is
the
procedure
used
to
specially
compress
the
bmp
file
i
would
to
a
rle
file
love
to
use
some
of
my
bmp
files
i

thanks

i
thought
id
reply
to
this
though
i
aint
brad
at
any
case
a
lot
of
picturefile
viewers
that
will
convert
say
between
gifetc
to
bmp
will
convert
to
rle
i
know
for
a
fact
that
paintshop
shareware
from
cica
desktop
i
think
filename
psvvvzip
i
think
where
vvv
is
the
ver
number
if
thats
not
true
let
me
know
and
ill
post
a
corection
this
however
will
write
your
rle
file
with
a
bmp
extension
so
you
have
to
rename
it
now
another
thing
this
is
from
the
windows
faq
your
file
has
to
be
less
than
k
at
least
thats
what
the
faq
says
but
mine
wont
work
for
more
than
about
they
mend
i
dont
know
your
file
has
to
fit
vga
size
or
whatever
standard
vga
size
is
if
you
use
a
nonvga
screen
eg
cga
ega
svga
there
is
also
a
way
to
do
it
but
i
thing
instead
of
vgalogolgo
you
use
another
file
such
as
cgalogolgo
egalogolgo
or
something
im
not
sure
about
this
as
i
have
a
vga
but
im
sure
you
could
find
it
in
the
faq
a
windows
help
ver
of
which
is
available
at
cica
but
dont
konw
the
filename
alsoyour
bmp
has
to
be
colours
or
less
these
specs
rule
out
some
of
the
good
bmps
i
found
cartoon
drawings
work
quite
well
as
they
have
the
advantage
of
looking
good
with
little
memory
finally
remember
to
save
your
current
wincom
before
and
put
your
new
wincom
in
the
windows
directory
also
dont
start
windows
from
a
directory
where
another
wincom
is
present
as
that
is
used
instead
of
the
one
in
the
windows
dir
and
win
wont
start
share
this
fairly
but
dont
take
a
slice
of
