AND
WINDOWS
ON
MY
PC
I
ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY
RUN
WINDOWS
THE
ONLY
DOS
BASED
APPLICATION
I
HAVE
IS
PROCOMMPLUS
IN
MY
CONFIGSYS
I
HAVE
LOADED
WITH
THE
OPTION
NOEMS
NO
EXPANDED
MEMORY
FOLLOWING
A
THREAD
IN
ONE
OF
THE
COMP
NEWSGROUPS
I
READ
THAT
IT
WAS
NO
NECESSARY
TO
HAVE
LOADED
INDEED
IN
THE
MANUAL
IT
SAYS
THAT
IS
USED
TO
GET
EXPANDED
MEMORY
OUT
OF
EXTENDED
MEMORY
SINCE
I
HAVE
THE
NOEMS
OPTION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
DEVICE
IS
USELESS
IN
MY
CASE
SHOULD
I
USE
OR
SHOULD
I
REMOVE
IT
FROM
MY
CONFIGSYS
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
HELP
