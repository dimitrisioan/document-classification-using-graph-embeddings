DEAR
FRIEND
THE
RISC
MEANS
REDUCED
INSTRUCTION
SET
COMPUTER
THE
RISC
USUALLY
HAS
SMALL
INSTRUCTION
SET
SO
AS
TO
REDUCE
THE
CIRCUIT
COMPLEX
AND
CAN
INCREASE
THE
CLOCK
RATE
TO
HAVE
A
HIGH
PERFORMANCE
YOU
CAN
READ
SOME
BOOKS
ABOUT
COMPUTER
ARCHITECTURE
FOR
MORE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
RISC
HMM
NOT
THAT
I
AM
AN
AUTHORITY
ON
RISC
BUT
I
CLEARLY
REMEMBER
READING
THAT
THE
INSTRUCTION
SET
ON
RISC
CPUS
IS
RATHER
LARGE
THE
DIFFERENCE
IS
IN
ADDRESSING
MODES
RISC
INSTRUCTION
SETS
ARE
NOT
AS
ORTHOGONAL
IS
CISC
THEORETICALLY
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
REDUCED
NOT
ANY
LONGER
THATS
WHY
EVERYONE
IS
ARGUING
ABOUT
RISC
VS
CISC
PERSONALLY
I
THINK
CISC
WILL
WIN
OUT
JUST
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
PENTIUM
NOT
THAT
I
LIKE
INTEL
ARCHITECTURES
EITHER
BUT
THATS
ANOTHER
STORY
BYE
DO
YOU
MEAN
THAT
THE
PENTIUM
IS
BETTER
THAN
A
RISC
OR
THAT
IT
WILL
OUTSELL
THEM
ALL
IF
THE
FIRST
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
INTEL
CISC
LIKE
THE
PENTIUM
ARE
A
ALWAYS
A
GENERATION
AWAY
FROM
THE
BEST
RISCS
ALSO
RISCS
CPU
ARE
MORE
COSTLY
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
NOT
SOLD
IN
THE
SAME
QUANTITIES
NOT
EVEN
ON
THE
SAME
ORDER
BUT
I
REMEMBER
READING
ABOUT
YEARS
MAYBE
ABOUT
A
FROM
HYPERCUBE
THAT
DID
A
MIPS
WAS
SUPERSCALLAR
AND
REORDERED
ITS
INSTRUCTION
ITSELF
SO
