THIS
QUIRK
HI
THERE
IM
HAVING
A
BIZARRE
VIDEO
PROBLEM
WITHIN
WINDOWS
I
HAVE
A
WITH
A
VIDEO
BOARD
IVE
BEEN
USING
THE
STANDARD
WINDOWS
VGA
DRIVER
WITH
OTHER
SIMILARLY
CONFIGURED
COMPUTERS
I
AM
THINKING
THAT
MY
PROBLEM
IS
WITH
THE
WAY
WINDOWS
REFRESHES
ITS
SCREEN
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ONCE
WINDOWS
HAS
BEEN
ENVOKED
THE
COLORS
START
CHANGING
THEMSELVES
AT
FIRST
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
HARDWARE
BUT
IF
YOU
OPEN
A
FULL
SCREEN
DOS
PROGRAM
FROM
WITHIN
THE
WINDOWS
SESSION
YOU
DONT
HAVE
ANY
PROBLEMS
UNTIL
YOU
GET
BACK
TO
WINDOWS
HOWEVER
WHEN
YOU
INITIALLY
RETURN
TO
WINDOWS
THE
ORIGINAL
COLORS
GET
REFRESHED
PROPERLY
ALSO
IT
IS
NOT
A
UNIFORM
COLOR
CHANGE
SO
IF
YOU
ARE
IN
SOLITAIRE
THE
DESIGN
ON
THE
BACK
OF
THE
CARD
MAINTAINS
ITS
ORIGINAL
COLOR
SCHEME
BUT
THE
WHITE
FRONTS
OF
THE
CARDS
WILL
TURN
GREY
THEN
BLUE
ETC
THE
COLOR
CHANGES
KEEP
GETTING
DARKER
UNTIL
FINALLY
EVERYTHING
IS
A
DARK
PURPLEISH
BLACK
IF
YOU
POP
OUT
TO
DOS
AND
EXIT
BACK
TO
WINDOWS
THE
SCREEN
GETS
REFRESHED
AGAIN
IF
I
DONT
LOG
INTO
WINDOWS
AND
JUST
DO
DOS
THINGS
FROM
THE
NOVELL
NETWORK
EVERYTHING
IS
FINE
I
ORIGINALLY
LOADED
THE
SOFTWARE
BY
BOUNCING
IT
DOWN
TO
THE
NET
FROM
THE
OTHER
MACHINE
I
HAD
JUST
FINISHED
CONFIGURING
THEN
FROM
THE
NET
TO
THIS
MACHINE
WHEN
I
RAN
INTO
PROBLEMS
I
DELETED
EVERYTHING
ON
THIS
MACHINE
AND
THE
NET
AND
TRIED
BOUNCING
IT
AGAIN
WHEN
THAT
DIDNT
WORK
I
TRIED
RELOADING
WINDOWS
TO
NO
AVAIL
ANY
THOUGHTS
ON
THINGS
TO
CHECK
OUT
I
AM
TOTALLY
BAFFLED
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
FOR
ANY
ASSISTANCE
AND
INSTRUCTION
