RE
QUESTION
ON
EISA
VIDEO
BOARD
PERFORMANCE
FROM
ARTICLE

CHRISTOPHER
F
WROTEN
I
HAVE
AN
EISA
MACHINE
AND
I
JUST
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
MOST
EISA
VIDEO
CARDS
ONLY
MATCH
THE
PERFORMANCE
OF
THEIR
ISA
COUNTERPARTS
FOR
INSTANCE
THE
EISA
ORCHID
PRO
DESIGNER
IISE
IS
ONLY
ABOUT
AS
FAST
AS
THE
ISA
DIAMOND
SPEEDSTAR
PLUS
WHICH
ISNT
WHAT
I
WOULD
CALL
FAST
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
EISA
VIDEO
CARDS
ARENT
AS
A
GROUP
ON
THE
SAME
LEVEL
OF
PERFORMANCE
AS
LOCAL
BUS
CARDS
GIVEN
THAT
EISA
VIDEO
CARDS
HAVE
A
BIT
BUS
TO
MOVE
DATA
AROUND
INSTEAD
OF
ISAS
BITS
GOOD
QUESTION
ANSWER
THE
EISA
BUS
DOES
MOVE
BITS
RATHER
THAN
ISAS
BUT
IT
STILL
MOVES
IT
AT
ABOUT
THE
SPEED
AS
THE
ISA
BUS
I
THINK
THATS
EITHER
OR
MHZ
THE
LOCAL
BUS
DESIGNS
ALSO
MOVE
BITS
LIKE
THE
EISA
BUT
THEY
MOVE
THE
DATA
AT
THE
CPU
SPEED
UP
TO
MHZ
SO
ON
A
CPU
THE
LOCAL
BUS
IS
MOVING
DATA
AT
MHZ
AND
THE
EISA
IS
MOVING
DATA
AT
OR
MHZ
SO
THE
LOCAL
BUS
SHOULD
BE
TO
TIMES
FASTER
THAN
EISA
ON
A
MHZ
CPU
EISA
SHOULD
BE
ABOUT
TWO
MAYBE
TIMES
AS
FAST
AS
ISA
SINCE
THEY
ARE
NOT
WHY
WOULD
ANYONE
ME
INCLUDED
PAY
A
HIGHER
COST
FOR
A
EISA
VIDEO
CARD
WHEN
ITS
PERFORMANCE
IS
NO
BETTER
THAN
AND
OFTEN
WORSE
THAT
A
MUCH
CHEAPER
ISA
VIDEO
BOARD
SUCH
AS
A
DIAMOND
SPEEDSTAR
FROM
PC
MAGAZINES
I
THINK
RECENT
REPORT
I
KNOW
THAT
ATI
MAKES
A
PRETTY
FAST
EISA
VIDEO
CARD
BUT
ITS
AROUND
WHICH
IS
JUST
ABOUT
DOUBLE
WHAT
MY
WALLET
WILL
ALLOW
ME
TO
SPEND
AND
FOR
I
COULD
GET
A
DIAMOND
VIPER
AND
STILL
HAVE
LEFT
OVER
OF
COURSE
ID
HAVE
TO
GET
A
LOCAL
BUS
MOTHER
BOARD
TOO
THATS
A
VERY
GOOD
QUESTION
THE
EISA
BUS
DOES
HAVE
MORE
ADVANTAGES
OVER
THE
ISA
BUS
THAN
JUST
ITS
WIDTH
FOR
EXAMPLE
MOREBETTER
INTERRUPTS
AND
BUS
MASTERING
BUT
THESE
OTHER
FACTORS
DO
NOT
IMPACT
A
VIDEO
CARD
VERY
MUCH
THEY
HAVE
MORE
IMPACT
ON
FILE
SERVERS
WITH
MULTIPLE
HARD
DRIVES
FULLTHROTTLE
NETWORK
CARDS
CDROMS
ETC
CAN
ANYONE
SHED
SOME
LIGHT
ON
MY
CONFUSIONFRUSTRATION
