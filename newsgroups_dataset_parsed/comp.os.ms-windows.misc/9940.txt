LEO
LIM
WRITES
OK
I
HAVE
A
W
DIAMOND
STEALTH
VRAM
I
WAS
REALLY
SATISFIED
W
ITS
PERFORMANCE
IN
WINDOWS
BUT
NOW
MORE
AND
MORE
GAMES
NEEDS
HIGHER
FRAME
RATES
IN
DOS
VGA
ESPECIALLY
THIS
NEW
STRIKE
COMMANDER
THIS
STEALTH
VRAM
CAN
ONLY
GIVE
ME
FPS
I
USE
MY
WINMARK
WAS
MILLION
I
THINK
SO
RIGHT
NOW
IM
CONSIDERING
TO
REPLACE
IT
W
A
NEW
CARD
WHICH
HOPEFULLY
CAN
PERFORM
APPROX
SAME
W
MY
CURRENT
VRAM
IN
WINDOWS
AND
ALSO
CAN
PERFORM
DOS
VGA
PREFERABLY
I
AM
ORDERING
THE
ACTIX
GRAPHICSENGINE
ULTRA
PLUS
IT
IS
THE
SAME
PRICE
AS
THE
STEALTH
CARD
PLUS
IT
IS
ALSO
BASED
ON
CHIP
THE
NEWEST
AND
FASTEST
CHIP
FROM
EVERYONE
IF
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
A
CARD
SEE
THE
APRIL
ISSUE
OF
PC
MAGAZINE
FOR
THEIR
REVIEW
THEY
NOTED
THIS
PERSONS
PROBLEM
WITH
DOS
THE
STEALTH
CARD
IS
NOT
A
VERY
GOOD
DOS
PERFORMER
THE
ACTIX
CARD
IS
RATED
THE
BEST
IN
THIS
CHIP
CLASS
NON
LOCAL
BUS
IT
GOT
GLOWING
REPORTS
FROM
THE
MAGAZINE
WAS
A
BEST
BUY
AND
I
CALLED
THEM
DIRECTLY
AND
THEY
JUST
UPDATED
THEIR
WINDOWS
DRIVERS
LAST
WEEK
THEY
HAVE
A
BULLETIN
BOARD
TO
GET
THE
LATEST
DRIVERS
THOUGH
SOMONE
POSTED
THAT
THIS
BBS
WAS
AT
AT
ANY
RATE
THE
ACTIX
GRAPHICS
ENGINE
ULTRA
OUTPERFORMS
ALL
THE
OTHER
CARDS
IN
THE
CLASS
BASED
ON
THE
WINMARK
RESULTS
IF
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
THE
ALL
AROUND
BEST
DOSWINDOWS
PERFORMANCE
CHECK
OUT
THE
ACTIX
CARD
THEIR
NUMBER
IS
PS
THE
ARTICLE
IN
PC
MAGAZINE
NOTED
THAT
IF
YOU
ARE
A
REGULAR
DOS
USER
IE
GAMES
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
ALSO
CHECK
OUT
THE
CHIP
FROM
IT
APPARENTLY
SCORES
JUST
AS
WELL
AND
IN
MANY
CASES
SLIGHTLY
BETTER
IN
DOS
THAN
THE
CHIP
IE
STEALTH
AND
ACTIX
CARDS
THEY
HAVE
COMPARABLE
WINDOWS
PERFORMANCE
AND
ARE
CHEAPER
TO
BUY
