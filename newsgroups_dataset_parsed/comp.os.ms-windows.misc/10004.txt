does
anyone
know
a
program
that
will
record
keyboard
sequences
that
i
do
in
a
windowed
dos
box
i
would
like
to
have
something
that
starts
a
telnet
program
and
then
logs
me
into
my
accounts
windows
recorder
doesnt
seem
to
be
able
to
record
the
key
sequences
thanks

i
think
you
would
need
a
dos
macro
program
superkey
by
borland
comes
to
mind
i
dont
think
windows
is
capable
of
sending
keystrokes
to
a
dos
window
what
you
want
to
do
sounds
like
a
security
problem
to
me
though
