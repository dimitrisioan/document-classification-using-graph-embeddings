re
mac
disks
in
windows
youre
right
you
cannot
read
or
write
a
mac
or
apple
ii
disk
or
apple
ii
disk
without
extra
hardware
however
mac
disks
can
be
read
and
written
in
a
pc
hd
drive
with
software
only
this
should
probably
be
added
to
every
pc
and
mac
faq
file
it
sure
gets
asked
enough
i
agree
that
this
should
be
added
to
some
sort
of
faq
list
but
we
have
strayed
from
the
original
topic
our
computer
environment
is
pretty
split
between
macs
and
pcs
i
am
lucky
and
get
to
have
both
on
my
desk
but
there
are
people
who
have
pcs
and
need
to
share
data
with
the
mac
users
here
the
mac
users
have
no
problems
because
of
package
called
dos
mounter
which
automatically
lets
the
mac
read
dos
disks
natively
for
the
pc
there
is
no
equivilant
that
i
know
of
both
macette
and
macsee
have
been
inconsistant
under
the
dos
platform
and
requires
you
to
perform
the
activity
in
a
dos
program
to
selectively
transport
the
files
the
question
originally
posed
was
if
there
is
such
a
program
that
hooks
into
windows
like
a
dll
that
will
interpret
the
reading
of
a
mac
disk
when
it
is
in
a
pc
and
allow
access
to
it
through
the
standard
file
dialogs
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
would
only
be
available
for
the
flopies
