HEY
SOUNDS
GREAT
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
WORKS
WITH
ODI
I
THOUGHT
IT
USES
NDIS
WFWG
DOES
USE
NDIS
BUT
IT
COOPERATES
WELL
WITH
THE
NDIS
SHIM
FOR
ODI
IVE
HEARD
THAT
IT
IS
AS
FAST
AS
NDIS
DIRECT
MY
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
LAN
WORKPLACE
WITH
ALL
ITS
DRIVERS
USES
UP
MOST
OF
MY
UMBS
SO
ID
HATE
TO
HAVE
TO
LOAD
MANY
MORE
DRIVERS
TO
MAKE
WORK
ALONG
THE
ADDITIONAL
TSR
LOAD
IS
MINIMAL
I
THINK
I
EAT
ANOTHER
TOTAL
THIS
IS
WORTH
IT
TO
ME
SINCE
IT
ALLOWS
ME
TO
GET
TO
MY
WINDOWS
NT
BOX
NOVELL
HASNT
RELEASED
A
DECENT
NT
NOVELL
CLIENT
YET
SO
I
SHARE
THROUGH
MY
WFWG
BOX
THIS
SOLUTION
IS
VERY
USABLE
