the
key
issue
that
i
bought
my

was
ink
drying
speed
you
really
have
to
try
awful
hard
to
get
the
ink
to
smear
the
hp
deskjets
need
seconds
to
completely
dry
in
both
cases
however
do
not
get
your
pages
wet
unlike
laser
printers
the
material
on
your
pages
is
ink
not
toner
but
that
should
go
without
saying
i
think
the
ink
now
used
in
the
deskjet
family
is
waterfast
ive
had
pictures
ruined
by
a
few
drops
of
rain
these
were
colour
pictures
from
a
deskjet
mind
you
it
could
have
been
acid
rain
i
use
a
ink
dries
fast
but
it
really
doesnt
like
getting
wet
