ODD
MOUSE
BEHAVIOR
HI
ONE
OF
MY
COWORKERS
IS
HAVING
A
VERY
ODD
PROBLEM
HIS
MOUSE
WORKS
FINE
IN
DOS
APPLICATIONS
IF
YOU
LOAD
THEM
FROM
THE
C
PROMPT
UNDER
WINDOWS
THE
MOUSE
POINTER
IS
PRESENT
BUT
DOES
NOT
MOVE
EVEN
IF
YOU
LOAD
A
DOS
APP
UNDER
WINDOWS
THE
MOUSE
DOESNT
WORK
THE
COMPUTER
IS
A
ZEOS
WDIAMOND
SPEEDSTAR
VGA
RUNNING
MS
DOS
AND
WINDOWS
MOUSE
DRIVER
IS
MICROSOFTS
IVE
TRIED
SWITCHING
THE
MOUSE
FROM
TO
IVE
TRIED
A
DIFFERENT
MOUSE
IVE
REINSTALLED
MOUSEDRV
AND
I
CANT
GET
THE
BLAMED
THING
TO
WORK
THE
ONLY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
HIS
SYSTEM
AND
MINE
WHERE
THE
MOUSE
WORKS
PERFECTLY
IS
THAT
HE
HAS
AN
EXPANSION
CARD
WITH
AN
ADDITIONAL
PARALLEL
AND
SERIAL
PORT
COULD
THAT
CAUSE
THE
PROBLEM
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
FOR
ANY
HELP
