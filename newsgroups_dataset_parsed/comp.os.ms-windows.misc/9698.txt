THE
ATI
GUP
THANKS
THE
LATEST
DRIVER
RELEASE
IS
AND
CAN
BE
FOUND
AT
FTPCICAINDIANAEDU
IN
THE
DIRECTORY
STRUCTURE
AS
I
CHECKED
WITH
ATIS
BBS
LAST
NITE
AND
THERE
WERE
NO
RELEASES
PAST
WE
HAVE
THE
ATI
LOCAL
BUS
CARD
AND
I
NOTICED
THAT
I
GET
GARBAGE
AROUND
THE
EDGES
OF
A
WINDOW
WHEN
I
MOVE
IT
HAS
ANYBODY
ELSE
NOTICED
THIS
ALSO
I
HAVE
THE
LOCAL
BUS
CARD
ALSO
AND
DONT
HAVE
ANY
SUCH
PROBLEMS
WITH
IT
NOW
BUT
THIS
IS
THE
SECOND
CARD
IVE
GOTTEN
THE
FIRST
CARD
DIDNT
WORK
IN
VGA
MODE
CORRECTLY

SOME
QUALITY
CONTROL

I
WOULD
SUGGEST
CHECKING
WITH
ATI

WENT
THROUGH
THE
VENDOR
I
BOUGHT
THE
CARD
FROM
SINCE
THE
PROBLEM
SHOWED
UP
IMMEDIATELY
I
NEVER
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
THROUGH
TO
ATIS
TECHNICAL
SUPPORT
NUMBER

SURE
LIKE
THE
WAY
THE
CARD
PERFORMS
THOUGH
I
HAVE
THE
ATI
ULTRA
PRO
LOCAL
BUS
