and
i
would
hardly
call
a
command
that
can
delete
a
tree
and
a
move
command
as
a
state
of
the
art
wizbang
feature
they
are
damn
necessary
i
have
often
cursed
not
being
able
to
have
some
kind
of
recursive
delete
you
are
missing
something
with
the
windows
file
manager
you
can
ms
but
i
dont
want
to
have
to
run
blasted
windows
every
time
i
want
to
delete
a
tree
it
is
absolutely
ludicrous
to
load
a
hog
like
that
just
to
delete
some
files
it
would
be
like
requiring
a
crane
to
change
the
tyre
on
a
car
wants
people
to
buy
windows
not
dos
ms
knows
dos
wont
last
forever
only
because
its
crap
which
is
noones
fault
but
their
own
they
want
you
to
move
to
windows
then
later
to
and
eventually
to
cairo
this
way
they
give
you
a
reason
to
by
deliberately
crippling
the
product
surely
no
oh
hold
on
i
guess
youre
right
that
certainly
stinks
of
microsoft
marketing
techniques
but
the
point
still
remains
that
a
command
to
delete
trees
is
not
new
technology
and
is
the
kind
of
thing
one
would
have
expected
to
see
long
before
windows
was
even
dreamt
of
want
good
file
handling
use
filemanexe
this
product
requires
microsoft
windows
dos
is
dead
well
amen
to
that
but
i
wish
it
were
a
damn
sight
deader
for
a
dead
product
its
used
an
awful
lot
and
i
suspect
its
going
to
carry
on
twitching
for
a
long
while
yet
which
isnt
doing
anyone
any
good
and
microsoft
dont
appear
to
have
given
up
marketing
dos
so
it
is
a
very
unusual
form
of
death
