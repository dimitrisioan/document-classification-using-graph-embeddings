RE
AMI
PRO
AND
PCTOOLS
COMPRESS
DOESNT
LIKE
BEING
MOVED
SORRY
ABOUT
THAT
DONT
WANT
TO
ALARM
ANYONE
I
DONT
THINK
THERE
IS
ANY
CORRELATION
BETWEEN
THE
CRASHES
AND
PCTOOLS
I
REINSTALLED
AMI
PRO
AND
RAN
COMPRESS
AGAIN
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
I
THINK
PROBLEMS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
RELATED
TO
FILLING
MY
DISK
UNTIL
IT
HAD
BYTES
LEFT
WHILE
FTPING
ALTHOUGH
I
WOULD
THINK
IT
WOULDNT
MATTER
SINCE
AMI
PRO
WASNT
RUNNING
AT
THE
TIME
AND
I
MADE
SPACE
AVAILABLE
IMMEDIATELY
ANYWAYS
BUT
WHATEVER
THE
CAUSE
IT
IS
WORKING
NOW
DEREK
