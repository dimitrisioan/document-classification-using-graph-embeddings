but
i
dont
want
to
have
to
run
blasted
windows
every
time
i
want
to
delete
a
tree
it
is
absolutely
ludicrous
to
load
a
hog
like
that
just
to
delete
some
files
it
would
be
like
requiring
a
crane
to
change
the
tyre
on
a
car
then
why
dont
you
download
som
of
the
public
domain
utilitys
the
do
exactly
what
you
want
an
shut
up
why
should
he
have
to
this
sort
of
thing
should
be
included
how
about
the
millions
of
people
who
dont
have
access
to
pd
libraries
over
networks
just
because
people
can
work
around
it
doesnt
mean
that
something
shouldnt
be
done
to
remedy
the
situation
these
are
perfectly
valid
points
and
i
agree
im
glad
we
ms
are
starting
to
remedy
this
situation
with
dos
and
it
will
get
better
in
future
releases
you
do
need
to
be
aware
of
some
history
however
in
the
midlate
mss
point
of
view
was
that
was
going
to
take
over
the
world
and
dos
would
be
phased
out
as
such
resources
for
dos
and
windows
for
that
matter
development
were
mostly
redirected
to
the
theory
was
to
keep
just
enough
resources
on
dos
to
support
people
until
they
started
using
so
utilities
and
such
for
dos
fell
by
the
wayside
then
windows
hit
the
market
flopped
at
seems
to
be
doing
a
little
better
but
its
future
is
still
cloudy
and
people
either
stayed
with
their
dos
and
apps
or
moved
to
windows
about
that
point
in
time
ms
made
its
decision
to
drop
for
doswindows
in
the
short
term
and
windowsnt
in
the
long
term
dos
much
improved
over
dos
and
was
the
first
result
of
mss
refocussing
on
dos
and
windows
version
takes
things
somewhat
further
and
i
suspect
future
versions
will
offer
even
more
in
terms
of
real
os
features
i
work
on
nt
and
have
no
real
clue
about
what
my
coworkers
over
in
dosland
are
doing
but
i
do
know
that
there
are
a
heck
of
a
lot
more
of
them
than
there
were
a
few
years
ago
dave
of
course
these
are
my
opinions
if
you
want
mss
opinions
as
a
pr
person
