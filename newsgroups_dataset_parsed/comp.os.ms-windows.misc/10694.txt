DISK
FROM
CHILI
PEPPER
SOFTWARE
FOR
HIERARCHICAL
STORAGE
MANAGEMENT
OF
MY
SELDOM
USED
OFFLINE
FILES
I
PLAN
TO
UPGRADE
TO
NT
WHEN
IT
BECOMES
A
RELEASED
PRODUCT
I
WAS
STONGLY
TEMPTED
TO
BECOME
A
BETA
USER
EARLY
ON
BUT
I
DONT
HAVE
TIME
TO
MESS
AROUND
WITH
THE
HASSLES
OF
BETA
SOFTWARE
I
EXPECT
TO
BUY
IT
TEAR
OFF
THE
SHRINK
WRAP
AND
USE
IT
WITHOUT
HASSLE
I
KNOW
UNREALISTIC
BUT
I
CAN
HOPE
CANT
I
AFTER
ALL
I
HAVE
WORK
TO
DO
THE
ADVICE
I
WANT
CONCERNS
THE
STATE
OF
NT
REGARDING
DEVICE
DRIVERS
AND
HARDWARE
SPECIFIC
STUFF
IN
GENERAL
HOW
SMOOTHLY
CAN
I
EXPECT
THE
UPGRADE
TO
GO
CAN
I
EXPECT
SUPPORT
FOR
ALL
MY
STUFF
OR
DO
I
STILL
NEED
TO
SCRAMBLE
AROUND
DOWNLOADING
DRIVERS
PAS
ORCHID
COLORADO
FROM
SOME
BBS
ETC
WHAT
STEPS
SHOULD
I
TAKE
TO
ENSURE
THE
INSTALLATION
GOES
SMOOTHLY
NOTE
THAT
I
WANT
TO
NUKE
DOS
TOTALLY
FROM
THE
SYSTEM
IM
ALLERGIC
TO
COMMAND
LINES
I
PLAN
TO
RUN
A
PURE
NT
SYSTEM
ALSO
WILL
NT
COMMUNICATE
WITH
THE
WORKGROUPS
LAN
WHAT
ABOUT
STACKER
I
CURRENTLY
HAVE
STACKER
ON
THE
FIRST
DISK
DRIVE
WITHOUT
STACKER
AND
THE
INFINITE
DISK
PRODUCT
I
WILL
HAVE
GREAT
DIFFICULTY
FITTING
EVERYTHING
I
HAVE
ON
THE
SYSTEM
ITS
CRAMPED
NOW
I
REALIZE
STACKER
WILL
BE
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
NT
BUT
WILL
THERE
BE
AN
NT
VERSION
OR
WILL
NT
SUPPORT
COMPRESSION
A
LA
DOS
I
KNOW
INFINITE
DISK
WILL
BE
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
NT
BUT
WILL
THEY
OFFER
OR
DOES
ANYBODY
ELSE
A
COMPARABLE
PRODUCT
FOR
NT
AND
AT
WHAT
COST
PERHAPS
I
NEED
TO
ASK
CHILI
PEPPER
THAT
QUESTION
I
CAN
LIVE
WITHOUT
ID
IF
I
HAVE
TO
BUT
ID
RATHER
NOT
WILL
NT
RUN
MY
DOS
APPS
THE
TELETEXT
BOARD
MAINLY
WITHOUT
DOS
ON
THE
SYSTEM
WHAT
DO
I
NEED
TO
KEEP
AROUND
ANY
FEEDBACK
OR
ADVICE
INCLUDING
FORGET
NT
WITH
GOOD
REASONS
IS
MUCH
APPRECIATED
MY
ONLY
SIGNIFICANT
REASON
FOR
MOVING
TO
NT
IS
I
NEED
A
BETTER
MULTITASKING
ENVIRONMENT
THAN
WINDOWS
AMONG
OTHER
REASONS
WAVE
LOCKS
UP
THE
MACHINE
FOR
HOURS
AND
HOURS
DOING
DSP
PROCESSING
ON
LARGE
AUDIO
FILES
AND
I
WANT
BETTER
LAN
SUPPORT
THAN
I
NOW
HAVE
INTERNET
ACCESS
ETC
MAYBE
THERE
ARE
BETTER
SOLUTIONS
THAN
NT
AND
IF
SO
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
HEARING
ABOUT
THEM
WHATS
ITS
STATUS
THESE
DAYS
PLS
RESPOND
BY
EMAIL
AND
IF
THERE
IS
INTEREST
ILL
SUMMARIZE
FOR
THE
NET
