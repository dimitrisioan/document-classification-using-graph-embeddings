dat
on
the
scsi
interface
other
hardware
includes
modemfax
serial
ports
and
a
teletext
board
ugly
dos
software
drives
the
latter
applications
used
include
normal
windows
stuff
excel
word
quicken
and
turbo
pascalwindows
but
the
important
stuff
is
my
audio
work
environment
which
includes
turtle
beach
wave
for
windows
mcs
stereo
and
other
misc
stuff
for
dinking
around
with
audio
files
also
i
use
stacker
on
the
primary
drive
hp
newwave
for
my
wifes
use
and
she
wont
let
me
get
rid
of
it
and
a
product
called
infinite
disk
from
chili
pepper
software
for
hierarchical
storage
management
of
my
seldom
used
offline
files
i
plan
to
upgrade
to
nt
when
it
becomes
a
released
product
i
was
stongly
tempted
to
become
a
beta
user
early
on
but
i
dont
have
time
to
mess
around
with
the
hassles
of
beta
software
i
expect
to
buy
it
tear
off
the
shrink
wrap
and
use
it
without
hassle
i
know
unrealistic
but
i
can
hope
cant
i
after
all
i
have
work
to
do
the
advice
i
want
concerns
the
state
of
nt
regarding
device
drivers
and
hardware
specific
stuff
in
general
how
smoothly
can
i
expect
the
upgrade
to
go
can
i
expect
support
for
all
my
stuff
or
do
i
still
need
to
scramble
around
downloading
drivers
pas
orchid
colorado
from
some
bbs
etc
what
steps
should
i
take
to
ensure
the
installation
goes
smoothly
note
that
i
want
to
nuke
dos
totally
from
the
system
im
allergic
to
command
lines
i
plan
to
run
a
pure
nt
system
also
will
nt
communicate
with
the
workgroups
lan
what
about
stacker
i
currently
have
stacker
on
the
first
disk
drive
without
stacker
and
the
infinite
disk
product
i
will
have
great
difficulty
fitting
everything
i
have
on
the
system
its
cramped
now
i
realize
stacker
will
be
incompatible
with
nt
but
will
there
be
an
nt
version
or
will
nt
support
compression
a
la
dos
i
know
infinite
disk
will
be
incompatible
with
nt
but
will
they
offer
or
does
anybody
else
a
comparable
product
for
nt
and
at
what
cost
perhaps
i
need
to
ask
chili
pepper
that
question
i
can
live
without
id
if
i
have
to
but
id
rather
not
will
nt
run
my
dos
apps
the
teletext
board
mainly
without
dos
on
the
system
what
do
i
need
to
keep
around
any
feedback
or
advice
including
forget
nt
with
good
reasons
is
much
appreciated
my
only
significant
reason
for
moving
to
nt
is
i
need
a
better
multitasking
environment
than
windows
among
other
reasons
wave
locks
up
the
machine
for
hours
and
hours
doing
dsp
processing
on
large
audio
files
and
i
want
better
lan
support
than
i
now
have
internet
access
etc
maybe
there
are
better
solutions
than
nt
and
if
so
i
would
appreciate
hearing
about
them
whats
its
status
these
days
pls
respond
by
email
and
if
there
is
interest
ill
summarize
for
the
net
thanks
