RE
WINDOWS
GRIPE
THERES
ONE
THING
ABOUT
WINDOWS
THAT
REALLY
FROSTS
ME
I
HAVE
OF
RAM
INSTALLED
IN
MY
SYSTEM
I
USE
A
UNDER
WINDOWS
DISKCACHE
AND
A
PERMANENT
SWAP
FILE
WHILE
I
CAN
NEVER
FILL
THE
MEMORY
UP
I
STILL
HAVE
PROBLEMS
SOMETIMES
BECAUSE
I
RUN
OUT
OF
GDI
RESOURCES
WHAT
GIVES
I
THINK
WINDOWS
COULD
MANAGE
THESE
RESOURCES
A
LITTLE
BETTER
ARE
YOU
USING
WINDOWS
OR
IF
YOURE
STILL
ON
DEVOTES
ABOUT
TWICE
AS
MUCH
MEMORY
TO
THESE
AND
RUNS
OUT
MUCH
LESS
FREQUENTLY
IF
YOU
MIGHT
USE
ONE
OF
THE
RESOURCE
MONITORS
SUCH
AS
THE
ONE
THAT
COMES
WITH
THE
WINDOWS
RESOURCE
KIT
OR
ONE
OF
THE
MANY
SHAREWARE
ONES
AVAILABLE
TO
SEE
WHICH
PROGRAMS
ARE
HOGGING
THE
RESOURCES
EVERY
ICON
INTERNAL
GRAPHICS
BRUSH
ETC
IN
EVERY
PROGRAM
RUNNING
USES
A
CERTAIN
AMOUNT
OF
THIS
LIMITED
MEMORY
AREA
ALSO
SOME
DONT
GIVE
IT
BACK
WHEN
THEYRE
FINISHED
