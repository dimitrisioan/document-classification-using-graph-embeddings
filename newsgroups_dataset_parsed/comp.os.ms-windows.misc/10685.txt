found
there
were
actually
two
surveys
one
of
randomly
selected
resellers
one
of
randomly
selected
users
from
the
upgrade
registered
user
database
both
surveys
showed
a
positive
rating
jen
if
jd
power
and
associates
did
the
survey
i
would
like
an
anonymous
ftp
site
to
pick
it
up
at
only
a
sucker
believes
an
ms
released
survey
results
about
an
ms
product
okassume
that
the
results
of
the
survey
whatever
they
are
are
honest
if
the
results
indicated
extreme
dissatisfaction
with
the
product
is
ms
going
to
tell
us
to
stop
buying
msdos
because
it
sux
sure
would
it
not
be
fair
to
say
that
the
relatively
few
people
who
have
decided
to
purchase
would
be
inclined
to
like
it
just
as
those
of
us
who
love
most
of
the
people
who
but
them
know
more
or
less
what
to
expect
and
are
not
disappointed
i
mean
it
is
nice
to
know
that
the
people
who
bought
it
are
happy
and
important
for
ms
to
know
and
i
dont
dispute
the
accuracy
i
just
would
hate
to
see
people
extrapolate
from
that
population
that
dos
is
the
next
computer
revolution
well
these
statistics
are
to
shut
people
up
and
add
some
microscopic
weight
to
ms
arguments
as
i
just
said
you
have
seen
what
automakers
do
who
is
going
to
believe
chrysler
if
they
tell
us
in
a
random
chryslerconducted
survey
my
theory
about
certain
people
is
that
they
are
convinced
that
if
a
point
is
maintained
long
enough
it
is
true
after
all
what
is
the
focus
of
this
company
information
money
and
information
technology
is
for
some
an
expedient
toward
these
ends
why
did
bill
gates
drop
out
of
college
was
it
because
he
couldnt
afford
it
at
the
time
was
it
because
as
the
wsj
says
he
couldnt
wait
to
use
what
he
knew
to
go
out
and
make
money
bill
gates
answer
to
this
question
would
be
highly
interesting
i
await
it
i
cant
stomach
bill
declaring
himself
a
visionary
and
using
every
available
opportunity
to
build
up
the
cult
around
himself
and
then
having
ms
sell
dos
and
windoze
as
their
main
