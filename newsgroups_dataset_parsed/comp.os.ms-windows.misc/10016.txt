CAUSING
BAD
SECTORS
ON
MY
HD
FROM
JDRIVERNETLINKCTSCOM
JOHN
DRIVER
I
AM
HAVING
SOMETHING
VERY
UNUSUAL
HAPPEN
FIRST
SOME
BACKGROUND
ON
MY
SYSTEM
I
HAVE
A
MITSUBISHI
MEG
HARD
DRIVE
AND
AM
RUNNING
SMARTDRV
THE
VERSION
THAT
COMES
WITH
WINDOWS
ON
IT
I
RARELY
USE
WINDOWS
I
USE
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
DISK
TECHNICIAN
GOLD
TO
DO
DIAGNOSTICS
LIVE
TIME
ON
MY
HARD
DRIVE
IT
WORKS
BY
HAVING
A
DEVICE
DRIVER
DETECT
WHENEVER
MORE
THAN
ONE
READ
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
A
FILE
OR
IF
THERE
IS
ANYTHING
ELSE
IS
WRONG
WITH
IT
AND
MINOR
PROBLEMS
ARE
FULLY
CHECKED
OUT
UPON
REBOOTING
MY
HARD
DRIVE
IS
NOTORIOUS
FOR
BAD
SECTORS
I
USUALLY
END
UP
WITH
NEW
BAD
SECTORS
A
WEEK
HERES
WHAT
HAPPENED
I
RAN
A
PROGRAM
AND
DTG
BROKE
IN
WITH
AN
EMERGENCY
WARNING
AND
RECOMMENDED
I
REBOOT
IT
GAVE
ME
THIS
MESSAGE
TWICE
BEFORE
THE
PROGRAM
WAS
FULLY
LOADED
I
EXITED
THE
PROGRAM
AND
DID
JUST
THIS
DTG
WENT
THROUGH
ITS
BOOTUP
PROCESS
EXAMINING
FOR
NEW
ERRORS
ETC
AND
A
SCREEN
POPPED
UP
AND
SAID
SOMETHING
ABOUT
SECTORS
FOR
A
BRIEF
PERIOD
OF
TIME
I
THEN
WENT
BACK
TO
THE
PROGRAM
EXECUTED
IT
AGAIN
AND
THE
EXACT
SAME
ERROR
WAS
DETECTED
I
REBOOTED
AND
TRIED
AGAIN
AND
THE
SAME
ERROR
HAPPENED
AGAIN
SO
I
REMOVED
DTG
FROM
MEMORY
AND
WENT
TO
THE
PROGRAM
TO
SEE
IF
I
COULD
DETECT
ANYTHING
WRONG
SURE
ENOUGH
THERE
WAS
A
NUMBER
OF
READ
ATTEMPTS
SO
I
REBOOTED
AND
RELOADED
DTG
BUT
REMOVED
THE
CACHE
I
EXECUTED
THE
PROGRAM
NO
READ
ERRORS
EITHER
AUDIBLE
OR
DETECTED
BY
DTG
I
QUIT
THE
PROGRAM
LOADED
THE
CACHE
AND
RAN
THE
PROGRAM
AGAIN
THE
ERRORS
WERE
DETECTED
OK
SO
THE
ERRORS
ARE
THERE
AND
DTG
DETECTS
BUT
DOESNT
FIX
THEM
WHEN
THE
CACHE
IS
LOADED
WHEN
THE
CACHE
IS
NOT
LOADED
THERE
ARE
NO
ERRORS
SO
TO
SEE
IF
THE
CACHE
WAS
INTERFERING
WITH
ANY
OTHER
FILES
I
WENT
INTO
XTREE
GOLD
AND
TAGGED
ALL
FILES
AND
SEARCHED
THEM
FOR
A
RANDOM
STRING
IN
OTHER
WORDS
I
WANTED
THE
PROGRAM
TO
COMPLETELY
READ
EVERY
FILE
ON
MY
HARD
DRIVE
BEFORE
I
GOT
THROUGH
THE
CS
DTG
HAD
DETECTED
AT
LEAST
SIX
ERRORS
AND
RECOMMENDED
I
REBOOT
DOES
ANYBODY
HAVE
ANY
IDEA
WHY
SMARTDRV
IS
CAUSING
MISREADS
ON
MY
HARD
DRIVE
OH
THERE
ARE
EXACTLY
TWO
MISREADS
PER
FILE
AND
IN
ABOUT
EVERY
FILES
ARE
AFFECTED
I
ORIGINALLY
POSTED
THIS
MESSAGE
TO
DISK
TECHNICIAN
CORPS
SYSTEM
BUT
I
FIGURED
SOMEONE
OUT
IN
NETLAND
MAY
KNOW
ENOUGH
ABOUT
SMARTDRV
TO
HELP
ME
