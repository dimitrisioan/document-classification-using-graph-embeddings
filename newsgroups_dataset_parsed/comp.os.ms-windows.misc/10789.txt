WRITES
LET
ME
POSE
A
QUESTION
HOW
MANY
MSDOS
USERS
ARE
OUT
THERE
WHO
HAVE
NO
ACCESS
TO
THE
NET
BUT
WOULD
PROBABLY
FIND
THIS
FEATURE
USEFUL
TOO
IE
YOUR
SUGGESTION
IMPLIES
THAT
MICROSOFT
IS
RELYING
ON
THE
SHAREWARE
OR
PD
PRODUCTS
TO
FILL
THE
GAPS
ON
DOS
OR
DID
I
MISUNDERSTAND
YOUR
STATEMENT
ITS
CALLED
THE
FREE
ENTERPRIZE
SYSTEM
I
SUGGESTS
THAT
THOSE
WHO
WISH
TO
ENHANCE
DOS
DO
IT
AN
SELL
IT
OR
GIVE
IT
AWAY
MICROSOFT
CANT
BE
EVERYTHING
TO
