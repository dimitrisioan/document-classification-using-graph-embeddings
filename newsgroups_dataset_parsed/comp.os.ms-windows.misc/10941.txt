terminal
woes
i
have
a
vlb
machine
with
a
wang
faxmodem
when
using
the
windows
terminal
application
the
only
way
i
can
get
it
to
see
the
modem
is
to
change
it
to
then
go
back
and
change
it
to
then
it
works
fine
i
have
it
set
to
as
the
port
to
use
i
dont
have
anything
plugged
into
and
ive
looked
over
the
manual
for
all
its
worth
but
what
am
i
missing
the
modem
is
jumpered
for
which
i
understand
means
i
cant
use
the
second
serial
port
and
the
modem
at
the
same
time
but
im
not
using
the
second
serial
port
anyway
also
when
using
procomm
for
dos
it
always
sees
the
modem
and
dials
but
doesnt
always
connect
me
when
the
other
end
answers
dont
know
if
that
helps
any
