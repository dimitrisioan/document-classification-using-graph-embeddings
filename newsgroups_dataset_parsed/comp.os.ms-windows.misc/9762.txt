i
would
be
very
appreciative
if
someone
would
answer
a
few
questions
about
windows
for
workgroups
i
currently
have
novell
netware
lite
which
does
not
work
with
windows
very
well
and
is
a
conventional
memory
hog
ver
i
am
considering
moving
all
our
machines
to
how
much
conventional
ram
does
use
over
and
above
the
driver
for
the
network
card
about
without
novell
support
if
i
have
a
novell
card
are
the
lsl
and
ipx
drivers
still
needed
no
does
do
a
license
check
over
the
network
to
ensure
each
machine
is
running
its
own
licenced
copy
of
note
i
do
not
want
to
break
the
license
agreement
and
i
will
buy
a
copy
of
for
each
of
our
machines
it
is
just
that
i
would
like
to
try
it
out
first
to
see
if
it
meets
our
needs
returning
one
opened
copy
is
much
easier
than
returning
n
opened
copies
no
if
you
buy
the
upgrade
to
windows
for
does
it
replace
all
of
win
as
you
install
it
or
does
it
depend
on
current
win
files
nearly
all
if
i
install
windows
nt
on
my
server
when
it
comes
out
will
i
have
any
troubles
with
the
machines
we
run
mixed
wnt
beta
and
no
problem
apart
from
printer
sharing
beta
problem
when
i
started
this
message
i
was
going
to
ask
only
questions
but
i
got
carried
away
ill
stop
now
we
had
problems
with
mouse
drivers
using
where
windows
didnt
seems
to
be
more
critical
about
it
it
was
actualy
a
port
problem
with
the
network
card
running
on
we
changed
it
to
now
everything
is
allright
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
ami
bios
as
well
i
look
forward
to
your
replies
