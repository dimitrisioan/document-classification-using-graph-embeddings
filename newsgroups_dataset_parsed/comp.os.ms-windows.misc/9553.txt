for
windows

an
ibm
and
run
windows
a
friend
installed
norton
desktop
for
windows
on
top
of
this
it
loads
automatically
when
i
type
win
and
surely
adds
to
the
already
dismally
slow
process
of
starting
up
i
would
like
to
know
how
to
stop
or
uninstall
this
program
i
have
taken
it
out
of
winini
but
it
still
pops
up
running
with
windows
i
did
a
big
search
and
found
reference
to
it
in
ndwini
systemini
and
progmanini
removing
it
here
causes
a
failure
when
starting
up
windows
progrmanini
has
a
group
ndwexe
which
cant
be
deleted
is
there
anyone
familiar
with
ndw
who
can
tell
me
how
to
turn
it
off
thanks
