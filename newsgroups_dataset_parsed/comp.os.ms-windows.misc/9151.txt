this
list
appears
to
imply
that
mswindows
that
has
a
cost
listed

at
comes
with
a
c

c

fortran
it
does
not
of

these
are
expensive
addons
that
drive
the
price
way

i
dont
know
if
the
same
applies
to
as
far
as
unix
is
concerned
there
is
a
free
unix
linux
that
has
cc
c
fortran
xwindows
and
many
other
features
besides
with
a
large
number
of
utilities
that
can
be
optionally
added
and
there
is
also
a

i
believe
both
these
unixs
are
quite
robust

youve
