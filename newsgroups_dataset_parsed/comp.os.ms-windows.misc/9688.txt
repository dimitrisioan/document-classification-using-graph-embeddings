GATEWAYING
MICROSOFT
MAILWORKGROUPS

WES

WE
HERE
AT
UTAH
STATE
UNIVERSITY
COOPERATIVE
EXTENSION
HAVE
BEEN
USING
FOR
A
WHILE
NOW
WE
WANTED
TO
TALK
TO
THE
INTERNET
WITH
THE
MAIL
PACKAGE
SO
WE
GOT
THE
SMTP
GATEWAY
YOU
ALSO
NEED
A
TCPIP
TRANSPORT
PACKAGE
ON
TOP
OF
THAT
WHICH
IS
UTTERLY
STUPID
BUT
THATS
WHAT
THEY
REQUIRE
TO
GET
THE
SMTP
GATEWAY
TO
WORK
YOU
NEED
A
DEDICATED
PC
FOR
THE
GATEWAY
AND
IF
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
AT
REMOTE
ACCESS
YOU
NEED
ANOTHER
DEDICATED
PC
FOR
THE
REMOTE
MAIL
STUFF
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
REMOTE
MAIL
GOING
BUT
YOU
INDICATE
THAT
THAT
IS
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
DO
THERE
IS
A
GLITCH
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
SYSTEM
THOUGH
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
IS
MS
MAIL
THE
GATEWAY
OR
THE
VAX
HERE
ON
CAMPUS
THAT
IS
CHOKING
IN
THE
MAIL
THAT
IS
SENT
THE
SCENARIO
IS
THIS
THE
OUTGOING
MAIL
GOES
TO
A
UNIX
SYSTEM
WHICH
THEN
ROUTES
THE
MAIL
WHERE
IT
NEEDS
TO
GO
IF
THAT
MAIL
IS
ROUTED
TO
THE
VAX
THE
VAX
HAS
PROBLEMS
SOME
TIMES
RECEIVING
THE
MAIL
MOST
MESSAGES
DO
GET
THROUGH
THIS
WAY
EXCEPT
IF
SOMEONE
HAS
THERE
MAIL
ON
THE
VAX
FORWARDED
TO
SOME
OTHER
LOCATION
THAT
IS
THE
MAIN
GOTCHA
WHERE
EVER
THE
MAIL
IS
FORWARDED
TO
THAT
PERSON
GETS
A
MESSAGE
HEADER
THEN
A
MESSAGE
SAYING
BOUDARY
ERROR
GARBAGE
CODE
STUFF
IF
YOU
CAN
STAY
AWAY
FROM
SENDING
TO
A
VAX
YOU
ARE
OK
THE
SYSTEM
PEOPLE
OF
COURSE
SAY
THAT
THE
VAX
IS
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
THE
GATEWAY
IS
PROBABLY
THE
PROBLEM
IF
ANYONE
WANTS
TO
GET
HELP
IT
IS
ONLY
FOR
ONE
SUPPORT
CALL
UNTIL
PROBLEM
IS
WORKED
OUT
PHOOEY
TO
THAT
I
SAY
I
AM
LOOKING
VIGOROUSLY
FOR
A
BETTER
IDEA
IF
YOU
GO
FORWARD
ON
ANY
OF
THIS
AND
FIND
OUT
ANYTHING
KNEW
PLEASE
DROP
ME
A
NOTE
ANYONE
THE
NEXT
ITTERATION
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
TCPIP
BUILT
IN
THEY
SAY
THE
NETXT
ITTERATION
OF
GOOD
LUCK
