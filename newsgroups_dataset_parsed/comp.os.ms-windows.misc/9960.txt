mouse
jumpiness
solved
cant
guarantee
that
itll
work
for
everyone
but
i
finally
fixed
my
mouse
jumpiness
problems
i
installed
a
bus
mouse
sorry
i
didnt
say
the
solution
was
free
in
the
past
id
tried
everything
with
my
microsoft
serial
mouse
cleaning
it
unloading
all
kinds
of
tsrs
turning
off
smartdrv
write
cacheing
changing
com
ports
nothing
worked
yesterday
i
finally
broke
down
and
bought
a
mouse
systems
bus
mouse
the
improvement
is
even
better
than
i
had
imagined
so
much
so
that
my
old
mouse
must
have
been
jumpy
all
the
time
i
just
thought
it
was
jumpy
sometimes
and
i
had
gotten
so
used
to
it
i
didnt
notice
my
wife
who
uses
the
computer
about
once
a
month
noticed
the
improvement
literally
within
a
second
i
cant
say
anything
about
other
bus
mice
but
with
the
mouse
systems
one
youll
have
to
give
up
either
or
to
an
irq
also
if
you
dont
know
mouse
systems
mice
have
three
buttons
the
driver
includes
a
utility
that
lets
you
assign
keystrokes
to
the
middle
button
hope
this
helps
someone
else
if
youre
anywhere
near
as
frustrated
as
i
was
its
well
worth
