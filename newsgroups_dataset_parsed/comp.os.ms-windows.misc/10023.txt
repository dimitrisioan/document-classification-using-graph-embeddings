WHY
IM
NOT
USING
DOS
ANYMORE
IVE
BEEN
RUNNING
DOS
FOR
ABOUT
A
MONTH
I
WAS
GENERALLY
IMPRESSED
WITH
THE
IMPROVEMENTS
THE
MULTIPLE
BOOT
CONFIGURATIONS
WERE
GREAT
THE
NEW
COMMANDS
WERE
NICE
AND
DOUBLESPACE
WORKED
FINE
TWICE
AS
SLOW
FOR
LARGE
DATA
TRANSFERS
TWICE
AS
FAST
FOR
SMALL
WITH
SMARTDRV
UNTIL
NOW
THIS
MORNING
AT
AM
WHILE
I
WAS
WORKING
ON
MY
RESEARCH
PAPER
I
HAD
TO
REBOOT
A
HUNG
DOS
PROGRAM
THAT
DID
NO
DISK
IO
FROM
WITHIN
WINDOWS
WHEN
MY
MACHINE
FINISHED
REBOOTING
I
FOUND
MY
WINDOWS
DIRECTORY
AND
ABOUT
TWO
THIRDS
OF
MY
OTHER
DIRECTORIES
WERE
IRREVERSIBLY
CORRUPTED
I
CANNOT
AFFORD
PROBLEMS
LIKE
THIS
IM
RETURNING
TO
DOS
MARK
PS
IVE
ALSO
NOTICED
BAD
SECTOR
ERRORS
FROM
DOUBLESPACE
WHERE
NONE
SHOULD
EXIST
