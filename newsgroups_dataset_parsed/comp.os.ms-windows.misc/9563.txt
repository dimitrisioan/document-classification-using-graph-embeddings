GAVE
IT
A
VERY
GOOD
REVIEW
IN

FOUND
OUT
THAT
THE

PEOPLE
HAD
HARDCODED

TEXT
INTO
THE

CLEVER
NO
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
WINBENCH
RESULTS
ARE
PRETTY
MUCH
INFLATED
TWO
THINGS
THAT
ANNOYED
ME
ABOUT
THE
PC
MAGAZINE
REVIEW
THEIR
BENCHMARKING
TECHNIQUE
IS
SERIOUSLY
FLAWED
AS
WAS
CLEARLY
SHOWN
BY
THE
GRAPHITE
AND
CHEATING
CANT
THEY
JUST
ADMIT
THAT
THEIR
BENCHMARK
IS
TO
EASY
TO
OPTIMIZE
FOR
ANDOR
CHEAT
ON
WINTACH
IS
MUCH
HARDER
TO
BEAT
THE
BIG
CHEAT
THAT
HERCULESIIT
USED
WAS
OVERLAPPIPPING
BITBLIT
AND
POLYLINE
OPTIMIZATION
AND
HERCULES
SENT
THEM
A
NEW
DRIVER
WHICH
DIDNT
DO
THIS
BUT
PRODUCED
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
SCORES
YET
THE
ONLY
THING
PC
MAGAZINE
SAYS
IS
THAT
SCORES
ARE
NOT
LEGITIMATE
COULDNT
THEY
AT
LEAST
MAKE
SOME
COMMENT
ABOUT
ITS
REALWORLD
PERFORMANCE
IM
NOT
SO
MUCH
GOING
BY
WINBENCH
FOR
PERFORMANCE
BUT
RATHER
BY
STEVE
GIBSONS
RESULTS
WHICH
ARE
MORE
REALWORLD
BASED
LIKE
USING
MICROGRAFX
DRAW
TO
BENCHMARK
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
GIBSON
THAT
IS
HE
WRITES
DESPITE
THESE
DOCUMENTED
CHEATS
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
THAT
IN
REALWORLD
APPLICATIONS
THE
HERCULES
GRAPHITE
ADAPTER
ACTUALLY
DRAWS
FASTER
THAN
ANY
OTHER
DISPLAY
ADAPTER
IN
THE
INDUSTRY
EVEN
THOUGH
ITS
JUST
A
MODEST
ISA

CARD
IT
OUTPERFORMED
EVERY
LOCAL

I
HAVE
INCLUDING
THE
STEALTH
VLB
THE
FAHRENHEIT
THE
ATI
VLB
AND
EVEN
THE
WEITEK
DIAMOND
VIPER
VLB
THIS
KIND
OF
PRAISE
IS
ENOUGH
FOR
ME
TO
BE
INTERESTED
IN
IT
BOGUS
WINBENCH
OR
NOT
WHEN
AND
IF
YOU
GET

UNTIL
I
GET
MY

YES
THE

FASTER
IN
