i
would
like
to
prevent
our
windows
users
from
using
ctlaltdel
from
within
windows
i
know
there
must
be
a
way
to
do
it
could
anyone
point
me
in
the
right
direction
thanks
in
advance

are
you
sure
you
want
to
do
that
if
a
win
app
locks
up
for
some
reason
ctrlaltdel
may
be
the
only
way
to
kill
the
app
and
get
back
to
windows
granted
it
doesnt
work
all
that
often
but
it
has
come
in
handy
on
occasion
i
consider
it
pretty
carefully
before
i
disabled
that
keystroke
just
a
thought
if
youd
like
to
talk
for
hours
just
go
ahead
now
