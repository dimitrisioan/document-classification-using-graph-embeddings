says
is
the
driver
support
as
seamless
as
program
support
eg
will
my
soundblaster
scanner
cdrom
tape
backup
continue
to
work
even
if
there
are
no
specific
nt
drivers
there
is
a
hardware
compatibility
guide
to
answer
these
questions
there
are
many
drivers
for
cd
rom
and
there
are
midi
and
other
sound
drivers
installed
i
dont
do
a
lot
with
sound
digitizing
on
this
platform
but
recall
seeing
items
for
their
configuration
in
the
control
panel
applet
there
is
built
in
support
for
tape
backup
systems
as
well
my
problem
i
wasnt
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
would
need
an
scsicdrom
for
windows
nt
when
ordering
the
betasdkpackage
so
my
question
is
there
any
driver
available
that
will
allow
me
to
use
my
mitsumi
nonscsi
cdrom
for
installation
if
there
is
one
from
which
place
ftpsite
can
i
get
it
many
thanks
in
advance
