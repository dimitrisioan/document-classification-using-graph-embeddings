re
procomm
plus
for
windows
problems
you
have
a
lot
more
problems
keeping
up
with
hardware
interrupts
in
windows
than
in
dos
regardless
of
what
communication
software
you
are
using
try
the
following
turn
off
disk
write
cache
for
the
disk
you
are
downloading
to
the
cache
will
save
up
so
much
that
when
it
grabs
control
of
the
machine
it
takes
too
long
to
write
to
disk
and
you
loose
characters
use
a
different
uart
for
your
serial
line
the
old
uarts
or
can
only
buffer
one
character
internally
the
new
uarts
can
buffer
which
should
be
plenty
for
most
situations
you
can
run
windowsmsdexe
to
find
out
what
uart
is
on
the
machine
