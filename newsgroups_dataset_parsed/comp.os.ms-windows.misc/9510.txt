anybody
seen
mouse
cursor
distortion
running
the
diamond
driver
sorry
dont
know
the
version
of
the
driver
no
indication
in
the
menus
but
its
a
recently
delivered
gateway
system
am
going
to
try
the
latest
drivers
from
diamond
bbs
but
wondered
if
anyone
else
had
seen
this
as
a
followup
this
is
a
coworkers
machine
he
has
the
latest
drivers
it
only
happens
using
the
driver
sometimes
it
takes
a
minute
or
so
for
the
cursor
to
wig
out
but
it
eventually
does
in
this
mode
i
susect
something
is
stepping
on
memory
the
video
card
wants
i
excluded
in
the
line
and
in
systemini
the
problem
persisted
perhaps
it
is
something
specific
to
the
gateway
machine
or
its
components
it
is
a
eisa
bus
with
an
ultrastore
controller
ah
well
i
was
hoping
this
was
some
kind
of
known
problem
or
somebody
had
seen
it
before
perhaps
a
call
to
gateway
is
in
order
but
i
do
find
folks
here
usually
are
far
more
in
the
know
