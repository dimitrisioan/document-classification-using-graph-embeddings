UTILITY
TO
EXPAND
DOS
FILE
DESCRIPTIONS
IN
DIRECTORY
LISTING
I
AM
LOOKING
FOR
A
WINDOWS
UTILITY
THAT
WOULD
GIVE
ME
A
LISTING
OF
FILES
IN
A
DIRECTORY
BUT
ALSO
DISPLAY
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
THE
FILE
THIS
UTILITY
WOULD
ALLOW
ME
TO
ENTER
AND
EDIT
FILE
DESCRIPTIONS
OF
HOPEFULLY
ANY
LENGTH
MAYBE
A
SMALL
WINDOW
WITH
A
SCROLL
BAR
I
WOULD
THEN
BE
ABLE
TO
BROWSE
MY
DIRECTORIES
AND
BE
ABLE
TO
SEE
WHAT
IS
IN
A
FILE
WITHOUT
HAVING
TO
OPEN
OR
EXECUTE
IT
ANY
SUCH
BEAST
OUT
THERE
IF
NOT
ANYONE
WANT
TO
WRITE
