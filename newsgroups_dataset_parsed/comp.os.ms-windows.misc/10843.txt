re
headtohead
win
and
im
waiting
for
june
first
to
roll
around
when
i
can
then
get
my
hands
on
pcsolarisunix
for
the
intel
chip
i
know
that
there
are
many
of
other
unix
possibilities
out
there
but
this
includes
the
wabi
windows
api
binary
interfacei
think
technology
that
wil
run
windows
apps
straight
outta
da
box
if
this
flies
in
enhanced
mode
then
heres
another
contender
to
look
out
for
in
the
corporateeducation
market
too
big
and
complex
for
the
home
frontwindows
will
take
those
while
nt
will
fight
it
out
for
the
smalltomid
businesses
however
once
the
powerpc
becomes
available
especially
in
laptopnotebook
form
then
these
will
migrate
into
all
marketsthe
ability
to
connect
up
to
a
unix
machine
at
work
and
yet
still
run
windowsmac
apps
at
home
is
going
to
be
real
attractive
to
alot
of
people
just
my
predictions
