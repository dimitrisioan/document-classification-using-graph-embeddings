I
AGREE
THAT
SEGMENTATION
UNNECESSARILY
COMPLICATES
THINGS
ITS
ANNOYING
TOO
BUT
WHEN
JUST
A
WINDOWS

I
DONT
THINK
ABOUT
IT
MUCH

I
DOUBT
MANY
OTHER
PEOPLE
THINK
ABOUT
IT

EVEN

WORKS
AND
THEY
GET
THEIR
WORK
DONE
JUST
A
NEUTRAL
COMMENT
ITS
FUNNY
I
THINK
HOW
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
WINDOWS
VS
SOUND
SO
VERY
SIMILAR
TO
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
ATHEISM
VS
CHRISTIANITY
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
ITS
SOMEHOW
VERY
PERSONAL
TO
PEOPLE
CONVICTIONS
ARE
IRRATIONAL
