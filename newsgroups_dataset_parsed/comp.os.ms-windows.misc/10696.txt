WRITES
MUCH
BS
DELETED
FOR
BREVITY
AGAIN
MY
POINT
WAS
THAT
NOT
ALL
MICROSOFTIES
ARE
HERE
TO
SELL
READERS
ON
OUR
PRODUCTS
WHICH
WOULD
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
NOADS
PHILOSOPHY
OF
USENET
NOR
DO
WE
NECESSARILY
HAVE
ACCESS
TO
INFO
THAT
OTHERS
HAVE
IT
CERTAINLY
SMACKS
OF
THAT
REMEMBER
THE
POLL
THAT
YOU
QUOTED
SAYING
THAT
YOU
HAD
SEEN
A
OF
USERS
BEING
SATISFIED
WITH
DOS
CARE
TO
RECALL
HOW
UNBIASED
THE
SAMPLE
SET
WAS
THAT
POST
SURE
LOOKED
LIKE
FUDAND
COMING
FROM
A
MICROSOFTIE
WELL
IT
SURE
SEEMED
LIKE
SOMETHING
WAS
NOT
ON
LEVEL
IF
I
RECALL
JEN
SAID
RIGHT
UP
FRONT
HOW
THE
SAMPLE
SET
WAS
DERIVED
WHERES
THE
FUD
ADVOCACY
IS
GOOD
BUT
SPREADING
FUD
TO
ADVOCATE
YOUR
FAVORITE
OS
IS
VERY
UNETHICAL
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
YOU
HAVE
A
VESTED
INTEREST
IN
THE
SUCCESS
OF
THAT
OS
DOES
THIS
MEAN
I
CAN
FLAME
YOU
IF
I
EVER
SEE
YOU
DOING
IT
FACE
IT
THE
ADVOCACY
GROUPS
ARE
FOR
THE
KIND
OF
THINGS
THAT
YOURE
PREACHING
AGAINST
THIS
IS
WHY
THEY
WERE
CREATED
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
TO
FILTER
OUT
ALL
THE
CRAP
FROM
THE
NEWSGROUPS
THAT
MIGHT
CONTAIN
REAL
INFORMATION
PHIL
NOTHING
I
HAVE
POSTED
HERE
IS
IN
ANY
WAY
SHAPE
OR

OFFICIAL
MICROSOFT
POLICY
OR

AND
SHOULD
NOT
BE
