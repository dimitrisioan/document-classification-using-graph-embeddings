TECHNOLOGIES
VIDEO
BOARD
NEEDED
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
FIND
A
WINDOWS
DRIVER
FOR
A
VIDEO
BOARD
THAT
IS
BASED
ON
THE
CHIPS
TECHNOLOGIES
CHIPSET
THE
ACTUAL
BOARD
IS
A
SCORPION
FRAMEGRABBER
MADE
BY
UNIVISION
IT
IS
BASED
ON
THE
CT
CHIPSET
BUT
ONLY
BARELY
SUPPORTS
THE
GRAPHICS
MODE
I
AM
HOPING
THAT
ANY
CT
DRIVER
COULD
BE
USED
IN
THE
MODE
