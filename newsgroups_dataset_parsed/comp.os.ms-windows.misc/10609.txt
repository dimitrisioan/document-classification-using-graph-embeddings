video
board
needed
i
would
like
to
find
a
windows
driver
for
a
video
board
that
is
based
on
the
chips
technologies
chipset
the
actual
board
is
a
scorpion
framegrabber
made
by
univision
it
is
based
on
the
ct
chipset
but
only
barely
supports
the
graphics
mode
i
am
hoping
that
any
ct
driver
could
be
used
in
the
mode
