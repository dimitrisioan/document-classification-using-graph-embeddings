microsoft
is
the
largest
software
company
on
the

i
cannot
think
of
even
one
computing
concept
that
they
innovated
and
brought
to
market
before
anyone
else
xeroxparcapple
osborne
next
gnu

have

what
has
microsoft
done
to
be
a
technological
leader
i
posted
this
question
before
but
i
got
nary
a
reply
i
make
the
challenge
now
to
anyone
who
can
come
up
with
somethingespecially
microsoft
employees
i
get
no
response
this
time
i
guess
it
pretty
much
assures
me
that
there
is
nonewhich
is
what
i
suspect
anyway
really
when
you
come
down
to
it
who
cares
i
just
hope
ms
keeps
doing
what
they
do
best
getting
usable
productive
software
to
the
masses
