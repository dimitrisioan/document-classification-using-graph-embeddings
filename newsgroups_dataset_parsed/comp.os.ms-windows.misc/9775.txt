RE
DIAMOND
SS
GREETINGS
IVE
HAD
A
BUNCH
OF
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
OPENING
A
DOS
WINDOW
ON
THE
DESKTOP
CAN
OCCASIONALLY
RESULT
IN
THE
WINDOWS
BLOWING
UP
INTO
A
SET
OF
HORIZONTAL
LINES
HASHING
THE
ENTIRE
DESKTOP
NOTHING
CAN
RECOVER
THIS
EXCEPT
TO
COMPLETELY
EXIT
FROM
WINDOWS
THE
OTHER
IRRITATING
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
WINDOWS
THAT
SCROLL
OFTEN
OVERWRITE
LINES
RATHER
THAN
ACTUALLY
SCROLLING
AS
IF
A
CR
WAS
PRINTED
WITHOUT
AN
LF
THIS
SEEMS
ONLY
TO
HAPPEN
TO
COMMUNICATIONS
PROGRAMS
BUT
I
CANT
NAIL
IT
DOWN
ANY
FURTHER
THAN
THAT
NOTE
THOUGH
THAT
THE
COMMS
PROGRAMS
DONT
HAVE
TO
BE
COMMUNICATING
EVEN
JUST
SCROLLING
BACK
THROUGH
CAPTURE
BUFFERS
OR
DISPLAYING
DISK
FILES
IN
THESE
PROGRAMS
CAUSES
THE
PROBLEM
PRIOR
TO
THE
LATEST
REV
OF
WORD
PERFECT
FOR
WINDOWS
WPWIN
WOULD
SOMETIMES
BLOW
UP
AND
THE
ERROR
MESSAGE
WOULD
CITE
THE
VIDEO
DRIVER
AS
THE
SOURCE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IVE
STILL
SEEN
THIS
BUT
ONLY
ONCE
OR
TWICE
WITH
WPWIN
DAVE
ZIMMERMAN
MY
OPINIONS
ARE
MY
OWN
