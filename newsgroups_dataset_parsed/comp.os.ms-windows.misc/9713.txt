WRITES
I
HAVE
OF
MEMORY
ON
MY
I
HAVE
BEEN
RUNNING
WINDOWS
WITHOUT
A
SWAP
FILE
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
WILL
MATHCAD
BE
HAPPY
WITH
THIS
OR
INSIST
ON
A
SWAP
FILE
PRESUMEABLY
YOU
MEAN
WITHOUT
A
PERMANENT
SWAP
FILE
IF
WINDOWS
NEEDS
A
SWAP
FILE
IT
WILL
UPO
AND
CREATE
ONE
IF
A
PERMANENT
ONE
DOESNT
EXIST
PERMANENT
IS
GENERALLY
FASTER
THOUGH
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
MATHCAD
WOULDNT
BE
HAPPY
WITH
EITHER
TYPEVER
IS
AND
SO
SHOULD
ANY
PROGRAM
CONFORMING
TO
THE

SPECIFICATION
