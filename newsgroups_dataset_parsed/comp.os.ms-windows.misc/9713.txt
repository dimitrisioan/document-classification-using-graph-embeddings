i
have
of
memory
on
my
i
have
been
running
windows
without
a
swap
file
for
several
months
will
mathcad
be
happy
with
this
or
insist
on
a
swap
file
presumeably
you
mean
without
a
permanent
swap
file
if
windows
needs
a
swap
file
it
will
upo
and
create
one
if
a
permanent
one
doesnt
exist
permanent
is
generally
faster
though
i
dont
know
why
mathcad
wouldnt
be
happy
with
either
typever
is
and
so
should
any
program
conforming
to
the
win
specification
