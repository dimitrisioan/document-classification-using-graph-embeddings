HERE

IN

I
THANK
THE

THE

TESTERS
FOR
THEIR

CONFIGURING

A
TURN
OFF

I
HAVE
TO
DISABLE

BECAUSE
THE
COMMUNICATION
PROGRAM
THAT
I
USE
TO

MY
SLIP
SERVER
QMODEM
DROPS
DTR
WHEN
I
EXIT
THE
PROGRAM
AND
THEREFORE
HANGS
UP
THE

IF
YOU
USE
A
PROGRAM
LIKE
KERMIT
OR
CONEX
TO
ESTABLISH
THE

THEN
THIS

NOT
BE

THESE

DO
NOT

HANGUP

WHEN

NOTE
IF
YOU
USE

YOU
DO
NOT

B

FIRST
THIS
CAN
BE

AUTOMATICALLY
IF
YOU
USE
A

LIKE

FROM
THE

OF

WHICH
WILL

ESTABLISH

THEN
LOAD

THE

IF
