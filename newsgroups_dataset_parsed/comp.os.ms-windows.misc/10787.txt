I
POSTED
A
MESSAGE
HERE
SOME
TIME
AGO
ASKING
WHY
MY
MOUSE
WAS
SO
JUMPY
WELL
I
THINK
I
KNOW
WHY
AND
IT
DOESNT
HAVE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
MOUSE
IT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
VIDEO
DRIVER
HERES
WHY
I
THINK
THAT
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
I
HELPED
A
GUY
INSTALL
THE
DRIVER
FOR
HIS
VIDEO
CARD
FOR
WINDOWS
HE
HAD
BEEN
USING
THE
NORMAL
WINDOWS
DEFAULT
VGA
DRIVER
WE
DONT
HAVE
THE
SAME
KIND
OF
MOUSE
MINE
IS
MICROSOFT
SERIAL
AND
HIS
IS
AN
OFF
BRAND
SERIAL
MOUSE
HIS
MOUSE
WORKED
FINE
UNTIL
I
INSTALLED
THE
DRIVER
ON
HIS
SYSTEM
THEN
HIS
MOUSE
BECAME
REALLY
JUMPY
TOO
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
I
CAN
DO
I
NEED
HIGH
RESOLUTION
