re
atm
now
hplj
pricing
while
there
are
too
many
ps
clones
to
count
some
of
which
are
quite
poor
trying
to
clone
something
that
goes
through
regular
modifications
does
require
some
patience
three
questions
come
to
mid
real
quick
for
something
like
this
q
which
version
of
adobe
ps
will
we
clone
aside
from
the
level
and
level
issues
adobe
has
in
the
past
released
new
code
that
incorporates
modificationsupgradesfixes
just
as
all
other
software
vendors
do
the
level
stuff
may
seem
sound
now
but
i
assure
youchanges
will
become
more
frequent
as
their
customer
list
begins
to
dwindle
in
the
face
of
competition
this
allows
them
to
shift
people
to
maintenance
as
well
as
design
efforts
for
level
q
do
we
duplicate
the
bugs
or
do
we
make
it
work
correctly
from
the
laserwriter
to
the
laserjet
there
have
been
bugs
if
i
had
a
number
to
call
at
hp
or
adobe
theyld
have
heard
from
me
deciding
which
approach
to
take
depends
on
which
printer
you
want
to
emulate
q
do
we
follow
the
red
book
or
do
we
follow
someones
implementation
without
a
doubt
there
are
differences
between
the
red
book
and
adobes
ps
with
level
many
issues
have
been
refined
but
the
red
book
does
leave
big
big
holes
in
the
implementation
specific
stuff
it
would
be
nice
it
the
red
bood
at
least
pined
things
down
enough
so
that
two
different
implementations
of
adobes
ps
dont
do
the
exact
opposite
given
an
identical
set
of
conditions
q
pscriptdrv
having
done
a
lot
of
ps
clone
testing
myself
the
unfortunate
side
of
testing
is
the
limited
number
of
sources
for
test
files
the
primary
source
we
use
is
genoa
and
having
characterizes
their
ps
ats
files
of
them
over
half
are
taken
from
pscriptdrv
it
may
not
ideal
but
the
ats
files
are
what
the
printer
vendors
use
im
sure
that
adobe
uses
them
too
but
adobes
output
is
by
definition
correct
even
if
its
wrong
yes
there
are
some
very
poor
clones
weve
seen
them
here
at
rastek
a
sub
of
genicom
which
has
its
own
clone
called
geniscript
some
are
poor
for
lack
of
design
some
are
poor
because
they
followed
the
red
book
and
some
are
poor
because
the
vendors
dont
know
what
ps
is
