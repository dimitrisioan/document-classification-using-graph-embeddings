hi
have
you
used
mac
system
or
if
the
answer
is
positive
you
would
know
if
mswindows
is
a
mature
os
days
ago
people
doubted
that
mswindows
is
not
a
real
os
i
can
see
why
they
have
such
question
mswindows
confuses
many
people
microsoft
common
complaints
about
ms
windows

jesse
hmmmm
why
do
i
get
the
feeling
that
this
is
gonna
start
one
of
those
endless
threads
mac
vs
win
and
might
even
end
up
as
vs
win
well
i
dont
know
if
windows
is
a
mature
os
if
i
have
seen
one
in
which
case
that
has
to
be
xwindows
but
dont
be
so
quick
to
judge
first
of
all
to
try
to
use
plain
vanilla
windows
is
as
courageous
as
to
try
to
use
plain
vanilla
dos
there
are
lots
of
very
nice
commercial
and
shareware
packagesutilities
that
will
boost
up
windows
past
what
ms
itself
thought
possible
for
example
norton
desktop
for
windows
a
replace
ment
for
progman
will
give
you
groupwithinagroup
capability
and
will
even
change
group
icons
it
will
launch
progs
by
association
well
fileman
does
that
too
or
by
dragging
the
file
in
the
apps
icon
now
mac
doesnt
do
that
huh
and
the
list
goes
on
and
on
now
windows
is
kinda
hard
to
finetune
boost
and
configure
but
thats
trhe
price
to
pay
for
not
paying
to
get
a
mac
or
an
capable
machine
an
entirely
differet
story
on
the
other
hand
if
you
dont
like
the
idea
of
pms
icons
not
correspnding
to
the
files
themselves
well
they
are
not
supposed
to
pm
is
a
program
launching
utility
not
a
file
manager
modify
your
settings
to
have
fm
as
your
shell
and
not
pm
or
get
a
couple
of
utilities
from
cica
that
supposedly
give
you
a
mac
feel
i
dont
wanna
get
in
the
discussion
which
is
a
better
system
macs
are
good
in
their
own
way
they
are
different
not
better
or
worse
than
win
pcs
actually
i
am
writing
this
from
a
mac
lab
as
a
user
assistant
so
dont
think
i
am
partial
to
win
by
all
means
check
out
the
stuff
in
cica
ftp
to
ftpcicaindianaedu
under
the
subdir
user
anonymous
or
wait
for
startrek
macs
os
on
a

the

we
are
