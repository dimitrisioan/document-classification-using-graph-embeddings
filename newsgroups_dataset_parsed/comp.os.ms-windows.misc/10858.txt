TRUETYPE
WHATS
GOING
ON
I
HAVE
JUST
ADDED
A
PANASONIC
DOT
MATRIX
PRINTER
TO
A
I
INSTALLED
THE
APPROPRIATE
WINDOWS
PRINTER
DRIVER
IE
ONE
SPECIFICALLY
FOR
THIS
PRINTER
BUT
IM
UNABLE
TO
PERSUADE
THE
POXY
THING
TO
PRINT
CORRECTLY
WHAT
APPEARS
TO
BE
HAPPENING
IS
THAT
THE
TRUETYPE
FONTS
DONT
GET
PRINTED
PROPERLY
MY
EXPERIMENTS
SHOW
THAT
ALL

FOR
EXAMPLE
A

MS

WILL

CORRECTLY
PROVIDING
THE
FONTS
IN

ARE

FONTS
WHEN
I
PRINT
TRUETYPE
FONTS
SOME
LINES
APPEAR
TO
BE
PRINTED
IN
THE
WRONG
ORDER
IF
I
CHANGE
THE

FONT
TO
A

FONT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
ELIMINATED
I
HAVE
TRIED
USING
PRINTER
DRIVERS
FOR
PRINTERS
WHICH
THE
SNAPPY
NAME
EMULATES
NAMELY
EPSOM
AND
IBM
PROPRINTER
AND
THE
SAME
PROBLEM
OCCURS
IF
THERE
IS
SOME
KIND
SOUL
WHO
CAN
TELL
ME
JUST
WHAT
THE
HELL
IS
GOING
ON
I
WOULD
BE
