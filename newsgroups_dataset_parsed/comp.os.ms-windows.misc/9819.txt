dos
quick
c
crashes
windows
i
am
using
dos
quick
c
in
a
dos
window
under
windows
and
the
other
day
while
i
was
running
the
compiler
i
got
a
general
protection
fault
immediately
followed
by
a
serious
disk
error
when
i
rebooted
i
found
that
about
files
had
gotten
crosslinked
which
is
a
pretty
serious
corruption
of
the
hard
drive
file
system
i
am
concerned
that
quick
c
in
a
dos
window
has
somehow
strayed
outside
its
protected
mode
world
and
corrupted
the
smartdrvexe
disk
cache
and
that
is
what
caused
the
disk
problem
i
thought
that
dos
programs
run
in
dos
windows
were
pretty
wellcontained
by
windows
if
that
is
true
then
maybe
the
quick
c
compiler
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
has
anybody
else
had
this
type
of
problem
i
only
recently
upgraded
from
quick
