CRASHES

I
AM
USING
DOS
QUICK
C
IN
A
DOS
WINDOW
UNDER
WINDOWS
AND
THE
OTHER
DAY
WHILE
I
WAS
RUNNING
THE
COMPILER
I
GOT
A
GENERAL
PROTECTION
FAULT
IMMEDIATELY
FOLLOWED
BY
A
SERIOUS
DISK
ERROR
WHEN
I
REBOOTED
I
FOUND
THAT
ABOUT
FILES
HAD
GOTTEN
CROSSLINKED
WHICH
IS
A
PRETTY
SERIOUS
CORRUPTION
OF
THE
HARD
DRIVE
FILE
SYSTEM
I
AM
CONCERNED
THAT
QUICK
C
IN
A
DOS
WINDOW
HAS
SOMEHOW
STRAYED
OUTSIDE
ITS
PROTECTED
MODE
WORLD
AND
CORRUPTED
THE
SMARTDRVEXE
DISK
CACHE
AND
THAT
IS
WHAT
CAUSED
THE
DISK
PROBLEM
I
THOUGHT
THAT
DOS
PROGRAMS
RUN
IN
DOS
WINDOWS
WERE
PRETTY
WELLCONTAINED
BY
WINDOWS
IF
THAT
IS
TRUE
THEN
MAYBE
THE
QUICK
C
COMPILER
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
HAS
ANYBODY
ELSE
HAD
THIS
TYPE
OF
PROBLEM
I
ONLY
RECENTLY
UPGRADED
