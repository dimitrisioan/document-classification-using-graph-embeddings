if
you

is
useable
you
must
not

much
windows
version
of
crash
protection
is
wearing
a
helmet

computing

brett
you
must

many
advertisements
crash
protection
is
such
a
marketing
gimick
it
isnt
funny
out
of
months
of
using
windows
on
my
new
machine
ive
only
had
it
crash
once
and
i
dont
have
a
run
of
the
mill
configuration
microsoft
is
not
a
leader
in
innovation
but
they
certainly
know
how
to
build
a
better

now
whats
wrong
with
that

its
always

you
never

steve
jobs
it
does
sound
funny
i
will
admit
but
for
me
it
is
true
windows
crashed
on
all
of
the
time
and
from
what
i
have
read
in
pc
mag
this
is
not
the
exception
gives
each
windows
app
a
vdm
and
they
cant
touch
each
other
or
generally
anything
they
arent
supposed
to
have
if
windows
works
for
you
then
great
maybe
this
is
why
some
people
dont
see
why
is
the
os
of
choice
if
windows
doesnt
crash
on
you
and
you
dont
mind
waiting
on
each
task
and
not
being
able
to
adress
your
memory
better
than
dos
some
of
the
key
reasons
for
using
are
gone
i
probably
would
still
use
it
but
it
would
be
more
of
an
even
fight
