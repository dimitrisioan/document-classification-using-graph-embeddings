DOWNLOADING
AS
A
BEGINER
I
JUST
WONDER
HOW
TO
TRANSFER
FILES
FROM
THE
SUN
SYSTEM
WHICH
IS
ON
THE
NETWORK
TO
MY
PC
AT
HOME
NOT
CONNECTED
TO
THE
NETWORK
I
TRIED
TO
USE
COMIT
TO
DO
SO
BUT
IT
WAS
VERY
SLOW
AND
IT
SEEMED
THAT
GETTING
MULTIPLE
FILES
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
COULD
ANYBODY
GIVE
ME
SOME
HINTS
INFOMATION
THANK
YOU
IN
ADVANCE
