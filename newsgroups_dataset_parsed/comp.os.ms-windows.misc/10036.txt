there

me
use

longer
than

you
can
use
any
type
of
unix
or
maybe
vms
or
buy
a
mac
or
something
if
you
want
longer
filenames
for
your
documents
i
heard
of
a
wordprocessor
for

which
let
you
assign
long
names
to
files
those
long
filenames
could
only
be
seen
from
that
programs
opensave
dialogs
though
maybe
someone
knows
more
about
this
wordprocessor
than
i
do
