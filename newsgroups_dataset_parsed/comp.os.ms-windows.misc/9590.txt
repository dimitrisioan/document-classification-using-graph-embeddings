i
have
two
questions
i
have
been
having
troubles
with
my
wordperfect
for
windows
when
i
try
to
select
and
change
fonts
etc
some
of
the
text
disappears
i
tried
to
center
two
lines
once
and
the
second
line
disappeared
i
can
not
find
the
error
and
i
do
not
know
how
to
correct
it
is
this
the
right
newsgroup
where
should
i
go
email
prefered
i
know
you
said
email
preferred
but
because
this
is
a
common
problem
with
wpwin
ill
post
it
here
the
screen
only
looks
like
the
text
is
gone
usually
you
can
just
pageup
then
pagedown
and
when
it
does
a
complete
refresh
the
text
reappears
i
have
hadon
rare
occasionsto
completely
exit
save
first
the
program
when
i
reopened
the
file
all
chaos
had
been
resolved
i
dont
know
why
it
does
this
but
it
is
annoying
the
graphics
problems
have
now
made
me
a
word
for
windows
