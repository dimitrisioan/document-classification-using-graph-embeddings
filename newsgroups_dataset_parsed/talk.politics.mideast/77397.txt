PERLMANQSOCOLORADOEDU
ERIC
S
PERLMAN
WRITES
SO
FAR
YOU
HAVE
PRESENTED
YOUR
OPINIONS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
MINE
I
WOULD
HARDLY
TAKE
THEM
AS
FACTS
BECAUSE
YOU
DONT
AGREE
WITH
THEM
HMM
NO
BECAUSE
A
FACT
AND
AN
OPINION
ARE
TWO
DIFFERENT
THINGS
WHAT
YOU
ARE
EXPRESSING
HERE
ARE
OPINIONS
NOT
FACTS
IN
THE
ABSTRACT
WHAT
YOURE
SAYING
IS
TRUE
BUT
THE
FACTS
HAPPEN
TO
AGREE
WITH
ME
AND
DISAGREE
COMPLETELY
WITH
YOU
I
COULD
GIVE
YOU
HUNDREDS
OF
WORDS
IN
MY
MOTHER
TONGUE
SPANISH
THAT
ARE
COMONLY
USE
AND
YOU
WILL
NEVER
FIND
IN
A
DICTIONARY
EVEN
MORE
I
COULD
SHOW
YOU
A
LOT
OF
MEANINGS
THAT
WORDS
IN
SPANISH
HAVE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THOSE
IN
THE
DICTIONARY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
LATTER
NOT
THE
FORMER
AND
WHAT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
IS
SLANG
IN
THE
LATTER
THAT
CLEARLY
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
THE
CASE
HERE
NO
I
AM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
SLANG
I
AM
TALKING
ABOUT
DIFFERENT
USES
OF
THE
SAME
LANGUAGE
IN
DIFFERENT
PLACES
LISTEN
PINKAS
IM
GOING
TO
COUNT
ON
THE
SUPPOSITION
THAT
YOU
THINK
THROUGH
THE
OPINIONS
YOU
HAVE
SOMETHING
WHICH
IS
BY
THE
WAY
AGAINST
MY
BETTER
JUDGMENT
BASED
ON
WHAT
IVE
SEEN
FROM
YOU
TO
DATE
WE
ARE
AGREED
ARENT
WE
THAT
DICTIONARIES
ARE
REFERENCE
BOOKS
FOR
THE
USAGE
OF
A
GIVEN
LANGUAGE
AND
IN
PARTICULAR
FOR
THE
MEANINGS
OF
THE
WORDS
AND
PHRASES
WHICH
COMPRISE
THAT
LANGUAGE
NOW
YOU
ARE
USING
MEANINGS
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
FROM
INDEED
IN
SOME
CASES
DIAMETRICALLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THOSE
GIVEN
IN
THE
DICTIONARY
AS
A
REFERENCE
BOOK
A
DICTIONARY
CONTAINS
THOSE
MEANINGS
IN
BOTH
PAST
AND
AS
MUCH
AS
IT
CAN
IN
CURRENT
USE
THATS
ALSO
WHY
THEY
ARE
UPDATED
SO
OFTEN
NOW
IF
YOU
ARE
SAYING
THINGS
WHICH
YOU
GIVE
DIFFERENT
MEANINGS
THAN
THE
DICTIONARY
DOES
AND
USING
NONSTANDARD
MEANINGS
ABOUT
EVERY
WORD
WHAT
IS
YOUR
CHANCE
OF
BEING
TAKEN
AT
FACE
VALUE
JUST
ABOUT
NONE
JUST
ABOUT
NO
ONE
WILL
TAKE
YOU
THAT
WAY
BECAUSE
THE
WORDS
MEAN
SOMETHING
DIFFERENT
TO
THEM
ITS
QUITE
CLEAR
TO
ME
FROM
THE
RESPONSE
THIS
THREAD
HAS
BEEN
GETTING
THAT
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
IS
HAPPENING
PONDER
THAT
AND
GUESS
WHY
ISNT
IT
CURIOUS
THAT
WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
DEFINE
IN
HOW
MANY
DIFFERENT
WAYS
THE
TERM
JEW
WHICH
IS
THE
BASIS
OF
THE
MOVEMENT
ITSELF
NO
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
THE
QUESTION
HASNT
BEEN
ASKED
GEE
I
HATE
IT
WHEN
PEOPLE
DRAW
CONCLUSIONS
WITHOUT
INFORMATION
DONT
YOU
I
HATE
PEOPLE
WHO
CANNOT
READ
I
DID
NOT
DRAW
ANY
CONCLUSION
I
JUST
SAID
THAT
IT
IS
CURIOUS
CONSIDERING
HOW
HETEROGENEOUS
THE
MOVEMENT
IS
WHAT
YOU
DID
WAS
ASK
A
LEADING
QUESTION
IN
ENGLISH
IDIOM
THE
PHRASE
AND
GUESS
WHY
IN
THE
WAY
YOU
USED
IT
IS
A
LOADED
QUESTION
WITH
ONLY
ONE
ANSWER
EXPECTED
I
ALSO
TAKE
OFFENSE
AT
BEING
TOLD
I
CANNOT
READ
BY
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
OBVIOUSLY
HAVING
TROUBLE
WITH
THE
SUBJECT
HIMSELF
MR
PINKAS
I
AM
A
PHD
CANDIDATE
IN
MY
FIELD
ONE
DOES
NOT
GET
TO
PHD
CANDIDACY
IF
ONE
CANNOT
READ
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
AND
JEWISH
NATIONALITY
IS
DEFINED
IN
TERMS
OF
RELIGION
AND
NOT
OF
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
EVEN
IF
OF
THOSE
DEFINED
AS
JEWS
IN
ISREAL
ARE
NOT
RELIGIOUS
FOR
THE
UMPTEENTH
TIME
IT
IS
NOT
DEFINED
IN
TERMS
OF
RELIGION
THIS
HAS
BEEN
PROVEN
TO
YOU
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
NO
IT
HAS
NOT
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
DEFINES
A
JEW
AS
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
A
JEWISH
MOTHER
AND
HAS
NOT
CONVERTED
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
THAT
IS
PRETTY
THE
SAME
AS
THE
RELIGIOUS
DEFINITION
THAT
IS
A
PROBLEM
I
AM
SAYING
THAT
I
DO
NOT
SUPPORT
ZIONISM
AS
IT
IS
NOW
I
BELIEVE
THAT
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
SOVIET
COMMUNIST
PARTY
SOME
MIGHT
EVEN
HAD
BEEN
INSPIRED
BY
NOBLE
IDEALS
DOES
THAT
CHANGE
THE
FINAL
RESULTS
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
THE
USSR
ARE
YOU
NOW
WISHING
TO
COMPARE
THE
USSR
AND
ISRAEL
OR
WHAT
ISRAEL
DOES
NOT
PRACTICE
CRUELTY
NOW
I
UNDERSTAND
YOU
ARE
UNABLE
TO
MAKE
ABSTRACTIONS
YOU
CANNOT
GET
THE
IDEA
FROM
A
TEXT
AND
YOU
TAKE
EVERYTHING
LITERALLY
BAD
THING
BALDERDASH
YOU
KNOW
THIS
IS
FALSE
I
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
MAKE
THE
ABSTRACTION
IF
IT
BORE
ANY
RESEMBLANCE
TO
THE
FACTS
OF
THE
MATTER
YOURS
DID
NOT
THE
ANALOGY
IS
UTTERLY
INAPPLICABLE
I
WOULDNT
BE
IN
THE
FIELD
IM
IN
ASTROPHYSICS
IF
I
COULDNT
MAKE
ABSTRACTIONS
AND
SPECULATE
ABOUT
THE
GENERAL
GRAND
SCHEME
OF
THINGS
I
ALSO
WOULDNT
BE
IN
EDUCATION
WHICH
I
AM
AND
MY
STUDENTS
GIVE
ME
RATHER
GOOD
REVIEWS
ID
ADD
IF
I
COULDNT
DRAW
SUCH
ANALOGIES
ABOUT
ISRAEL
NOT
PRACTICING
CRUELTY
ASK
THOSE
PALESTINIANS
IN
ISRAELI
PRISONS
THOSE
WHO
WERE
TORTURED
THOSE
WHOSE
HOUSES
HAD
BEEN
BLOWN
BY
THE
ARMY
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
PALESTINIANS
IN
ISRAELI
PRISONS
ARENT
TORTURED
AND
THEIR
HOUSES
WERENT
BLOWN
UP
BY
THE
ARMY
IN
FACT
YOUVE
SEEN
ME
PROTESTING
SUCH
MEASURES
ON
THIS
NET
BEFORE
ARE
YOU
NOW
TRYING
TO
INTIMATE
MY
AGREEMENT
WITH
THEM
I
NEVER
SAID
IT
DIRECTLY
NOR
INDIRECTLY
I
AM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
DEFINED
THEMSELVES
AS
ZIONISTS
HERE
I
AM
SURE
MOST
OF
THEM
ARE
GOOD
HONEST
AND
CARING
PEOPLE
I
AM
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
RESULTS
OF
THE
ZIONIST
MOVEMENT
IN
OTHER
WORDS
YOU
ARE
TAKING
THAT
AS
A
MONOLITH
AND
IGNORING
THE
DISSENSION
WITHIN
IT
DISAGREEMENT
THAT
IS
EXPRESSED
FREELY
AND
IS
WIDELY
BASED
JUST
AS
BAD
CAN
YOU
READ
OR
ARE
YOU
JUST
TYPING
AT
RANDOM
DO
YOU
KNOW
THE
MEANINGS
OF
THE
WORDS
YOU
USE
OR
DO
YOU
EXPECT
THE
READER
TO
READ
YOUR
MIND
I
CAN
READ
JUST
FINE
THANK
YOU
AND
I
DONT
NEED
SOMEONE
WHO
IS
OBVIOUSLY
HAVING
SOME
TROUBLES
WITH
A
TONGUE
WHICH
ISNT
HIS
NATIVE
ONE
TELLING
ME
HOW
TO
READ
THE
WORDS
IN
MY
OWN
NATIVE
TONGUE
IF
IT
WERE
SPANISH
ID
ASK
YOU
I
AM
TALKING
ABOUT
A
MOVEMENT
WHOSE
ACTIONS
RESULTED
IN
A
LAW
OF
RETURN
WITH
A
RELIGIOUS
DEFINITION
OF
JEW
A
COUNTRY
THAT
DEFINES
NATIONALITY
BASED
ON
RELIGION
THEN
YOURE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
MOVEMENT
AS
IT
EXISTS
TODAY
AS
IVE
BEEN
TRYING
TO
TELL
YOU
PLEASE
READ
THE
ARGUMENTS
IVE
GIVEN
YOU
IF
YOU
CAN
STILL
SAY
THIS
AFTER
READING
THEM
YOU
NEED
TO
READ
THEM
AGAIN
I
AM
TALKING
ABOUT
SOMETHING
I
CONSIDER
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
SUCH
AS
DIFFERENCIATION
BASED
ON
RELIGIOUS
BELIEF
AFTER
ALL
IF
ARABS
IN
ISRAEL
CANNOT
SERVE
IN
THE
ARMY
IS
BECASUE
THEY
WERE
NOT
BORN
IN
THE
RIGHT
RELIGION
ARABS
IN
ISRAEL
NOT
ONLY
CAN
BUT
DO
SERVE
IN
THE
IDF
AS
YOU
WELL
KNOW
THEY
CAN
SERVE
IT
IS
TRUE
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
DO
THE
ALL
THE
SAME
THINGS
AS
THE
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
WHO
HAPPEN
TO
BE
JEWS
YES
THEY
ARE
AS
YOU
WELL
KNOW
OK
FINE
NOW
WE
KNOW
WHAT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
BUT
DO
YOU
SEE
MY
POINT
ABOUT
HOW
YOUR
WORDS
COULD
EASILY
HAVE
BEEN
TAKEN
DIFFERENTLY
IT
IS
NOT
WE
IT
WAS
YOU
AS
IN
THE
SECOND
PERSON
IN
SINGULAR
WHO
CANNOT
UNDERSTAND
A
TEXT
IF
THINGS
ARE
NOT
EXPLICITLY
SAID
BALDERDASH
SEE
ABOVE
ONCE
AGAIN
YOU
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
GALL
AND
ABSOLUTELY
NO
RIGHT
TO
LECTURE
A
NATIVE
SPEAKER
OF
A
LANGUAGE
WHO
IS
WELL
EDUCATED
IN
IT
IN
A
LANGUAGE
WHICH
ISNT
YOUR
OWN
NATIVE
TONGUE
AND
WITH
WHICH
YOURE
OBVIOUSLY
HAVING
PROBLEMS
SO
THERE
IS
NO
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
CITIZENSHIP
AND
NATIONALITY
IN
ISRAEL
OR
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
ACTUALLY
IT
DOESNT
I
MEAN
EXACTLY
THAT
ARAB
AND
JEWISH
CITIZENS
OF
ISRAEL
HAVE
THE
SAME
RIGHTS
IF
THERE
IS
NO
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THEM
WHY
KEEPING
THEM
IN
IDS
BETTER
YET
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
TELL
ME
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
DIFFERENCES
IN
SOCIAL
LIFE
BETWEEN
ARABS
AND
JEWS
SOCIAL
LIFE
IS
ONE
THING
LEGAL
STATUS
IS
ANOTHER
ONCE
AGAIN
THIS
IS
A
LEADING
QUESTION
SO
IT
FOLLOWS
A
RELIGIOUS
DEFINITION
AND
NOT
A
CULTURAL
ONE
THAT
IS
WHAT
I
CALL
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
NO
BECAUSE
THE
JEWISH
RELIGION
AND
CULTURE
ARE
INTIMATELY
INSEPARABLY
INTERTWINED
IF
ONE
RENOUNCES
JUDAISM
ONE
RENOUNCES
JUDAISM
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
TRUE
FINAL
QUESTION
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
BE
BOTH
JEWISH
AND
MUSLIM
JEWISH
AND
CHRISTIAN
YOUR
RESPONSE
WILL
BE
ENLIGHTENING
HOW
SAD
TO

MODEL
OF
DECORUM
AND
TRANQUILLITYBECOME
