gaza
and
separation
from
israel
gaza
and
the
idea
of
separation
the
israeli
lefts
inability
to
cope
with
the
challenges
it
is
presented
with
by
reality
becomes
obvious
at
those
moments
when
the
reality
does
not
line
up
with
the
expectations
of
the
left
we
were
able
to
see
this
clearly
during
the
gulf
war
because
of
the
palestinians
popular
solidarity
with
iraq
yossi
sarid
currently
minister
of
the
environment
made
his
infamous
statement
you
look
for
me
ie
iam
not
making
any
more
efforts
to
speak
with
you
from
yossi
sarids
point
of
view
palestinian
reality
during
the
gulf
war
was
not
the
lengthy
curfew
or
the
danger
of
hunger
it
brought
with
it
but
whether
or
not
the
palestinians
accepted
what
was
acceptable
to
the
party
similarly
meretz
mk
deddi
tzuker
recently
faced
with
criticism
from
residents
of
the
west
bank
town
of
beit
sahour
over
his
governments
and
his
partys
lack
of
action
for
human
rights
and
peace
responded
by
asking
those
present
at
the
discussion
whether
they
would
rather
have
a
likud
government
from
the
leftists
perspective
this
is
the
best
government
because
it
is
their
government
regardless
of
what
it
does
these
members
of
the
israeli
left
have
already
decided
how
the
future
of
the
occupied
territories
will
look
and
they
want
to
dictate
to
the
palestinians
how
to
get
there
an
essential
step
towards
this
future
is
their
participation
in
yitzhak
rabins
government
and
from
their
point
of
view
the
expulsions
were
a
marginal
byproduct
of
this
government
of
peace
which
need
not
disturb
the
routine
course
of
events
likewise
the
rabinic
policies
in
gaza
the
blowing
up
of
houses
with
antitank
rockets
and
the
significant
increases
in
the
number
of
persons
injured
in
the
suppression
of
demonstrations
need
not
disturb
it
but
the
fact
that
reality
is
not
as
they
would
have
it
forces
itself
upon
them
when
a
mob
in
gaza
falls
upon
a
settler
who
has
lost
his
way
when
a
settler
is
stabbed
by
his
palestinian
workers
or
when
a
palestinian
knifes
people
in
the
streets
of
tel
aviv
then
all
hell
breaks
loose
and
the
israeli
left
has
nothing
to
propose
except
separation
lets
cut
ourselves
off
from
the
palestinians
lets
build
a
fence
so
high
that
they
wont
be
able
to
harm
us
this
is
the
cry
of
the
israeli
left
let
us
erect
a
fence
between
us
and
the
reality
whith
is
the
occupation
meron
benvenisti
writes
about
this
in
haaretz
the
liberal
left
which
does
not
differentiate
between
physical
separation
and
the
future
of
the
territories
must
come
to
understand
that
the
regime
of
magnetic
cards
exclusion
of
arab
workers
closure
and
curfew
are
instruments
of
enforcement
designed
for
the
suppression
of
a
population
in
revolt
and
that
their
ideological
support
for
separation
only
provides
humanitarian
arguments
for
the
legitimization
of
the
status
quo
enforced
separation
is
carried
out
only
to
meet
the
need
of
the
ruling
community
but
it
is
only
the
ruled
population
which
bears
its
burden
whoover
thinks
that
out
of
gaza
first
is
a
liberal
humanitarian
idea
had
best
contemplate
the
question
of
whether
this
position
is
also
moral
it
is
very
easy
to
shake
off
responsibility
for
this
concentration
of
human
suffering
and
to
thus
also
disregard
responsibility
for
its
creation
it
is
very
easy
to
erect
a
fence
between
jewish
and
arab
neighborhoods
in
jerusalem
when
this
fence
has
a
gate
the
keys
to
which
are
at
the
disposal
of
one
hand
which
opens
to
allow
the
jews
to
pursue
all
their
interests
but
is
barred
to
the
arabs
from
the
other
front
