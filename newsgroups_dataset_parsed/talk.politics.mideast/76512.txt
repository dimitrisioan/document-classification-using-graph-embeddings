WHY
WAS
THUS
VERY
SEVERE
YET
THE
HOSTILE
PROPAGANDA
DISSEMINATED
THROUGHOUT
THE

DELIBERATELY
IGNORED
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
CIVILIAN
POPULATION
OF
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
ACTUALLY
GIVEN
A
WARNING
BY
US
BEFORE
THE
BATTLE
BEGAN
ONE
OF
OUR
TENDERS
CARRYING
A
LOUD
SPEAKER
WAS
STATIONED
AT
THE
ENTRANCE
TO
THE
VILLAGE
AND
IT
EXHORTED
IN
ARABIC
ALL
WOMEN
CHILDREN
AND
AGED
TO
LEAVE
THEIR
HOUSES
AND
TO
TAKE
SHELTER
ON
THE
SLOPES
OF
THE
HILL
BY
GIVING
THIS
HUMANE
WARNING
OUR
FIGHTERS
THREW
AWAY
THE
ELEMENT
OF
COMPLETE
SURPRISE
AND
THUS
INCREASED
THEIR
OWN
RISK
IN
THE
ENSUING
BATTLE
AS
IS
THOROUGHLY
ESTABLISHED
BY
MANY
SOURCES
THE
LOUDSPEAKER
TRUCK
GOT
STUCK
IN
A
DITCH
TOO
FAR
FROM
THE
VILLAGE
FOR
IT
TO
PROVIDE
A
USUEFUL
WARNING
A
SUBSTANTIAL
NUMBER
OF
THE
INHABITANTS
OBEYED
THE
WARNING
AND
THEY
WERE
UNHURT
A
FEW
DID
NOT
LEAVE
THEIR
STONE
HOUSES
PERHAPS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CONFUSION
THE
FIRE
OF
THE
ENEMY
WAS
MURDEROUS
TO
WHICH
THE
NUMBER
OF
OUR
CASUALTIES
BEARS
ELOQUENT
TESTIMONY
OUR
MEN
WERE
COMPELLED
TO
FIGHT
FOR
EVERY
HOUSE
TO
OVERCOME
THE
ENEMY
THEY
USED
LARGE
NUMBERS
OF
HAND
GRENADES
AND
THE
CIVILIANS
WHO
HAD
DISREGARDED
OUR
WARNINGS
SUFFERED
INEVITABLE
CASUALTIES
THE
EDUCATION
WHICH
WE
GAVE
OUR
SOLDIERS
THROUGHOUT
THE
YEARS
OF
REVOLT
WAS
BASED
ON
THE
OBSERVANCE
OF
THE
TRADITIONAL
LAWS
OF
WAR
WE
NEVER
BROKE
THEM
UNLESS
THE
ENEMY
FIRST
DID
SO
AND
THUS
FORCED
US
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
ACCEPTED
CUSTOM
OF
WAR
TO
APPLY
REPRISALS
I
AM
CONVINCED
TOO
THAT
OUR
OFFICERS
AND
MEN
WISHED
TO
AVOID
A
SINGLE
UNNECESSARY
CASUALTY
IN
THE
DIR
YASSIN
BATTLE
BUT
THOSE
WHO
THROW
STONES
OF
DENUNCIATION
AT
THE
CONQUERORS
OF
DIR
YASSIN
WOULD
DO
WELL
NOT
TO
DON
THE
CLOAK
OF
HYPOCRISY
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
THE
CAPTURE
OF
DIR
YASSIN
THE
JEWISH
AGENCY
FOUND
IT
NECESSARY
TO
SEND
A
LETTER
OF
APOLOGY
TO
ABDULLAH
WHOM
MR
BEN
GURION
AT
A
MOMENT
OF
GREAT
POLITICAL
EMOTION
CALLED
THE
WISE
RULER
WHO
SEEKS
THE
GOOD
OF
HIS
PEOPLE
AND
THIS

THE
WISE
RULER
WHOSE
MERCENARY
FORCES
DEMOLISHED

ETZION
AND
FLUNG
THE
BODIES
OF
ITS
HEROIC
DEFENDERS
TO
BIRDS
OF
PREY
REPLIED
WITH
FEUDAL
SUPERCILIOUSNESS
HE
REJECTED
THE
APOLOGY
AND
REPLIED
THAT
THE
JEWS
WERE
ALL
TO
BLAME
AND
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
DISSIDENTS
THROUGHOUT
THE
ARAB
WORLD
AND
THE

AT
LARGE
A

TWO

OVERLOOKED
THE
MAIN

AND
THEIR
FALL
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
CAPTURE
OF
KASTEL
BY
THE

MADE
IT
POSSIBLE
TO

OPEN
THE
ROAD
