CONDEMNS
DEBUT
OF

GROUP
IN

ILYESS
B
BDIRA
WRITES
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
BEN
BAZS
MIND
AND
HEART
ARE
ALSO
BLIND
NOT
ONLY
HIS
EYES
I
USED
TO
RESPECT
HIM
TODAY
I
LOST
THE
MINIMAL
AMOUNT
OF
RESPECT
THAT
I
STRUGGLED
TO
KEEP
FOR
HIM
TO
ALL
MUSLIM
NETTERS
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
GUY
WHO
GAVE
A
FATWAH
THAT
SAUDI
ARABIA
CAN
BE
USED
BY
THE
UNITED
STSTES
TO
ATTACK
IRAQ
THEY
WERE
ATTACKING
THE
IRAQIS
TO
DRIVE
THEM
OUT
OF
KUWAIT
A
COUNTRY
WHOSE
CITIZENS
HAVE
CLOSE
BLOOD
AND
BUSINESS
TIES
TO
SAUDI
CITIZENS
AND
ME
THINKS
IF
THE
US
HAD
NOT
HELPED
OUT
THE
IRAQIS
WOULD
HAVE
SWALLOWED
SAUDI
ARABIA
TOO
OR
AT
LEAST
THE
EASTERN
OILFIELDS
AND
NO
MUSLIM
COUNTRY
WAS
DOING
MUCH
OF
ANYTHING
TO
HELP
LIBERATE
KUWAIT
AND
PROTECT
SAUDI
ARABIA
INDEED
IN
SOME
MASSES
OF
CITIZENS
WERE
DEMONSTRATING
IN
FAVOR
OF
THAT
BUTCHER
SADDAM
WHO
KILLED
LOTSA
MUSLIMS
JUST
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
KILLING
RAPING
AND
LOOTING
RELATIVELY
RICH
MUSLIMS
AND
ALSO
THUMBING
HIS
NOSE
AT
THE
WEST
SO
HOW
WOULD
HAVE
YOU
DEFENDED
SAUDI
ARABIA
AND
ROLLED
BACK
THE
IRAQI
INVASION
WERE
YOU
IN
CHARGE
OF
SAUDI
ARABIA
FATWAH
IS
AS
LEGITIMATE
AS
THIS
ONE
WITH
THAT
KIND
OF
CLERGY
IT
MIGHT
BE
AN
ISLAMIC
DUTY
TO
SEPARATE
RELIGION
AND
POLITICS
IF
RELIGION
MEANS
OFFICIAL
CLERGY
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
IDEA
TO
NOT
HAVE
GOVERNMENTS
HAVE
AN
OFFICIAL
RELIGION
DE
FACTO
OR
DE
JURE
BECAUSE
WITH
HUMAN
NATURE
LIKE
IT
IS
THE
AMBITIOUS
AND
NOT
THE
PIOUS
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
THE
ONES
WHO
RISE
TO
POWER
THERE
ARE
JUST
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
WORLD
OR
ANY
COUNTRY
FOR
THE
CITIZENS
TO
REALLY
KNOW
IF
A
LEADER
IS
REALLY
DEVOUT
OR
IF
HE
IS
JUST
A
SLICK
OPERATOR
CAIRO
EGYPT
UPI
THE
CAIROBASED
ARAB
ORGANIZATION
FOR
HUMAN
RIGHTS
AOHR
THURSDAY
WELCOMED
THE
ESTABLISHEMENT
LAST
WEEK
OF
THE
COMMITTEE
FOR
DEFENSE
OF
LEGAL
RIGHTS
IN
SAUDI
ARABIA
AND
SAID
IT
WAS
NECESSARY
TO
HAVE
SUCH
GROUPS
OPERATING
IN
ALL
ARAB
COUNTRIES
YOU
MAKE
IT
SOUND
LIKE
THESE
GUYS
ARE
ANGELS
ILYESS
IN
YOUR
CLARINET
POSTING
YOU
EDITED
OUT
SOME
STUFF
WAS
IT
THE
FOLLOWING
FRIDAYS
NEW
YORK
TIMES
REPORTED
THAT
THIS
GROUP
DEFINITELY
IS
MORE
CONSERVATIVE
THAN
EVEN
SHEIKH
BAZ
AND
HIS
FOLLOWERS
WHO
THINK
THAT
THE
HOUSE
OF
SAUD
DOES
NOT
RULE
THE
COUNTRY
CONSERVATIVELY
ENOUGH
THE
NYT
REPORTED
THAT
BESIDES
COMPLAINING
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WAS
NOT
CONSERVATIVE
ENOUGH
THEY
HAVE
ASSERTED
THAT
THE
APPROX
SHIITES
IN
THE
KINGDOM
ARE
APOSTATES
A
CHARGE
THAT
UNDER
SAUDI
AND
ISLAMIC
LAW
BRINGS
THE
DEATH
PENALTY
DIPLOMATIC
GUY
SHEIKH
BIN
JIBRIN
ISNT
HE
ILYESS
CALLED
FOR
SEVERE
PUNISHMENT
OF
THE
OR
SO
WOMEN
WHO
DROVE
IN
PUBLIC
A
WHILE
BACK
TO
PROTEST
THE
BAN
ON
WOMEN
DRIVING
THE
GUY
FROM
THE
GROUP
WHO
SAID
THIS
ABDELHAMOUD
ALTOWEIJRI
SAID
THAT
THESE
WOMEN
SHOULD
BE
FIRED
FROM
THEIR
JOBS
JAILED
AND
BRANDED
AS
PROSTITUTES
IS
THIS
WHAT
YOU
WANT
TO
SEE
HAPPEN
ILYESS
IVE
HEARD
MANY
MUSLIMS
SAY
THAT
THE
BAN
ON
WOMEN
DRIVING
HAS
NO
BASIS
IN
THE
QURAN
THE
AHADITH
ETC
YET
THESE
FOLKS
NOT
ONLY
LIKE
THE
BAN
THEY
WANT
THESE
WOMEN
FALSELY
CALLED
PROSTITUTES
IF
I
WERE
YOU
ID
CHOOSE
MY
HEROES
WISELY
ILYESS
NOT
JUST
REFLEXIVELY
RALLY
BEHIND
ANYONE
WHO
HATES
ANYONE
YOU
HATE
SAY
THAT
WOMEN
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
WORK
SAY
THAT
TV
AND
RADIO
ARE
TOO
IMMORAL
IN
THE
KINGDOM
NOW
THE
HOUSE
OF
SAUD
IS
NEITHER
MY
LEAST
NOR
MY
MOST
FAVORITE
GOVERNMENT
ON
EARTH
I
THINK
THEY
RESTRICT
RELIGIOUS
AND
POLITICAL
REEDOM
A
LOT
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
I
JUST
THINK
THAT
THE
MOST
LIKELY
REPLACEMENTS
FOR
THEM
ARE
GOING
TO
BE
A
LOT
WORSE
FOR
THE
CITIZENS
OF
THE
COUNTRY
BUT
I
THINK
THE
HOUSE
OF
SAUD
IS
FEELING
THE
HEAT
LATELY
IN
THE
LAST
SIX
MONTHS
OR
SO
IVE
READ
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
STEPPED
UP
HARASSING
BY
THE
MUTTAWAIN
RELIGIOUS
POLICENOT
GOVERNMENT
OF
WESTERN
WOMEN
NOT
FULLY
VEILED
SOMETHING
STUPID
FOR
WOMEN
TO
DO
IMO
BECAUSE
IT
SENDS
THE
WRONG
SIGNALS
ABOUT
YOUR
MORALITY
AND
IVE
READ
THAT
THEYVE
CRACKED
DOWN
ON
THE
FEW
HOMEBASED
EXPARTIATE
RELIGIOUS
GATHERINGS
AND
EVEN
POSTED
REWARDS
IN
GOVERNMENTOWNED
NEWSPAPERS
OFFERING
MONEY
FOR
ANYONE
WHO
TURNS
IN
A
GROUP
OF
EXPARTIATES
WHO
DARE
WORSHIP
IN
THEIR
HOMES
OR
ANY
OTHER
SECRET
PLACE
SO
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
GROWN
EVEN
MORE
INTOLERANT
TO
TRY
TO
TAKE
SOME
OF
THE
WIND
OUT
OF
THE
SAILS
OF
THE
MORECONSERVATIVE
OPPOSITION
AS
UNISLAMIC
AS
SOME
OF
THESE
THINGS
ARE
THEYRE
JUST
A
SMALL
TASTE
OF
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
THESE
GUYS
OVERTHROW
THE
HOUSE
OF
SAUD
LIKE
THEYRE
TRYING
TO
IN
THE
LONG
RUN
IS
THIS
REALLY
WHAT
YOU
