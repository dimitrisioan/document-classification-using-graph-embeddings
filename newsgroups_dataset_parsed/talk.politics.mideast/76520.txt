ACCORDING
TO
EXODUS
THERE
WERE
JEWS
THAT
MARCHED
OUT
OF
EGYPT
THIS
IS
ONLY
THE
NUMBER
OF
ADULT
MALES
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
JEWISH
SLAVES
LEAVING
EGYPT
WAS
MUCH
LARGER
THE
NUMBER
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
ARRIVED
TO
THE
HOLY
LANDS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
SUBSTANTIALLY
LESS
UDE
TO
THE
HARSH
DESERT
AND
THE
KILLINGS
BETWEEN
THE
JEWISH
TRIBES

NABIL

THINKING
IF
WE
ARE
GUILTY
OF
SOMETHING
SO
IS
EVERYONE
ELSE
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR
YOU
NABIL
JEWISH
TRIBES
ARE
NOT
NEARLY
AS
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
THE
FRATRICIDAL
MURDERING
THAT
IS
STILL
SO
COMMON
AMONG
ARABS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
THERE
WERE
NO
KILLINGS
BETWEEN
THE
JEWISH
TRIBES
ON
THE
WAY
I
DONT
LIKE
THIS
COMMENT
ABOUT
TYPICAL
THINKING
YOU
COULD
STATE
YOUR
INTERPRETATION
OF
EXODUS
WITHOUT
IT
AS
I
READ
EXODUS
I
CAN
SEE
A
LOT
OF
KILLING
THERE
WHICH
IS
PAINTED
BY
THE
AUTHOR
OF
THE
BIBLE
IN
IDEOLOGICALRELIGIOUS
COLORS
THE
HISTORY
IN
THE
DESERT
CAN
BE
SEEN
AS
AN
ETHOS
OF
ANY
NOMADIC
PEOPLE
OCCUPYING
A
LAND
THATS
WHY
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
GREAT
BOOK
WITH
WHICH
DESCENDANTS
ARABS
TURKS
AND
