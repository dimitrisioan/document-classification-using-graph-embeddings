WRITES
LETS
NOT
FORGET
THAT
THE
SOLDIERS
WERE
KILLED
NOT
MURDERED
THE
DISTINCTION
IS
NOT
TRIVIAL
MURDER
HAPPENS
TO
INNOCENT
PEOPLE
NOT
PEOPLE
WHOSE
LINE
OF
WORK
IS
TO
KILL
OR
BE
KILLED
IT
JUST
SO
HAPPENED
THAT
THESE
SOLDIERS
IN
THE
LINE
OF
DUTY
WERE
KILLED
BY
THE
OPPOSITION
THAT
STILL
DOESNT
MEAN
WE
SHOULD
CHEER
THEIR
DEATHS
POLICEMEN
ARE
ALSO
IN
THE
LINE
OF
FIRE
AND
THEIR
JOB
INCLUDES
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
GETTING
KILLED
SHOULD
WE
BE
HAPPY
WHEN
THEY
DIE
AS
I
SAID
BEFORE
THE
QUESTION
IS
NOT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
YOU
AGREE
WITH
THE
POLICIES
OF
ISRAEL
YOU
MAY
WISH
FOR
THE
ISRAELIS
TO
CEASE
OCCUPATION
BUT
DONT
REJOICE
