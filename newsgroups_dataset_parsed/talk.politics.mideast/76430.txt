and
in
the
attack
was
a
response

to
years
of
constant
shelling
by
terrorist
organizations
from
the
golan
sb
heights
children
were
being
murdered
all
the
time
by
terrorists

israel
sb
finally
retaliated
nowhere
do
i
see
a
war
that
israel
started
so
that
sb
the
borders
could
be
expanded
i
agree
with
all
you
write
except
that
terrorist
orgs
were
not
shelling
israel
from
the
golan
heights
in
but
rather
from
lebanon
tsiel
i
would
contend
that
there
was
shelling
from
both
sides
of
the
border
starting
from
the
early
certainly
the
plo
did
shell
northern
israel
from
the
arqoub
region
but
israel
did
much
more
shelling
destroying
several
south
lebanese
villages
at
the
very
least
we
can
say
that
both
sides
exchanged
shelling
with
occasional
aerial
raids
by
israel
on
lebanese
villages
in
any
case
steves
characterization
that
the
invasion
was
only
in
response
to
years
of
shelling
from
lebanon
is
false
israel
had
many
reasons
for
invading
but
mainly
it
did
so
to
install
a
government
in
lebanon
favorable
to
israel
and
it
nearly
achieved
this
aim
with
the
election
of
basheer
el
gemayel
and
his
brother
amin
el
gemayel
but
the
internal
situation
in
lebanon
was
too
hard
to
control
and
predict
so
israel
had
to
withdraw
and
amin
el
gemayel
had
to
abrogate
the
th
of
may
