not
exactly
the
same
but
reminiscent
of
the
assassination
of
count
bernadotte
who
was
the
un
negotiator
during
the
israeli
war
of
independence
he
was
killed
by
the
israelis
seems
he
was
being
too
successful
in
negotiating
a
ceasefire
which
would
have
worked
territorially
against
the
nascent
israel
compared
to
continued
war
that
operation
was
done
by
a
small
jewish
fraction
before
the
state
even
existed
and
as
far
as
i
remember
was
disaproved
by
most
of
the
jews
saying
that
he
was
killed
by
the
israelis
is
plain
wrong
because
there
wasnt
israel
at
the
time
look
up
the
facts
first
post
second
bernadotte
was
assassinated
in
september
by
lehi
under
the
orders
of
its
three
commanders
one
of
whom
was
yitzhak
shamir
there
is
no
hard
evidence
of
complicity
of
the
israeli
government
despite
some
effort
by
the
un
and
other
organizations
us
intelligence
swedish
government
to
find
it
however
a
great
fuss
was
made
over
the
apparent
lack
of
zeal
of
the
israeli
government
to
track
down
the
killers
the
lehi
man
who
actually
pulled
the
trigger
later
became
a
personal
friend
of
david
bengurion
the
best
published
account
in
english
is
