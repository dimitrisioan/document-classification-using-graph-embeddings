ISRAEL
AN

ADAM
SHOSTACK
WRITES
WHICH
WAS
MY
POINT
BY
CONVERTING
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
I
DO
NOT
LOOSE
MY
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
I
JUST
LOOSE
MY
RELIGIOUS
IDENTIFICATION
I
DISAGREE
BY
CONVERTING
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
YOU
CERTAINLY
DO
CHANGE
YOUR
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
AND
LOSE
THAT
PART
OF
YOU
WHICH
WAS
JEWISH
I
WOULD
CHANGE
ONE
OF
THE
MANY
PARTS
THAT
DEFINE
MY
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
IF
I
LOOSE
A
LEG
IT
MIGHT
CHANGE
MY
PERSONALITY
BUT
I
DO
NOT
STOP
BEING
A
HUMAN
BEING
EVEN
MORE
WHEN
SOMEONE
GETS
A
BABOON
HEART
THAT
PERSON
IS
STILL
HUMAN
TO
BE
A
PART
OR
NOT
OF
THE
JEISH
NATION
IS
DEFINED
BY
MY
CULTURE
AND
NOT
BY
MY
RELIGION
ACTUALLY
IF
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
WHICH
IS
IN
FACT
LIKE
CONVERTING
INTO
A
NONJEWISH
IN
TERMS
OF
RELIGION
I
AM
STILL
CONSIDERED
AS
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
NO
THERE
IS
A
SERIOUS
CULTURAL
AND
RELIGIOS
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
RENOUNCING
THE
JEWISH
GOD
AND
ACCEPTING
A
NEW
ONE
THOU
SHALL
HAVE
NO
OTHER
GODS
BEFORE
ME
CONVERSION
IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
THIS
ATHEISM
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
WIGGLE
AROUND
WITH
NOT
REALLY
THAT
IS
WHAT
DIFFERENCIATES
AGNOSTICS
FROM
ATHEISTS
AS
AN
ATHEIST
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THERE
IS
A
GOD
NOR
DO
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
EVER
WAS
ONE
SO
THOSE
COMMANDMENTS
HAVE
NO
MEANING
TO
ME
ALSO
THERE
ARE
A
LOT
OF
IDEAS
THAT
HAVE
NO
MEANING
TO
ME
THE
IDEA
OF
A
CHOSEN
PEOPLE
THE
IDEA
OF
A
GIVEN
RIGHT
TO
THE
LAND
OF
ISRAEL
THE
IDEA
OF
KEEPING
KOSHER
THE
IDEA
OF
OPPOSING
INTERMARRIAGE
THE
IDEA
OF
HAVING
A
TORAH
THAT
WAS
INSPIRED
BY
GOD
ETC
BY
BEING
AN
ATHEIST
I
CANNOT
SUPPORT
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
AS
DEFINED
BY
A
RELIGIOUS
PRINCIPLE
OR
BASED
ON
A
RELIGIOUS
IDENTITY
FOR
ME
RELIGION
IS
JUST
ANOTHER
PIECE
IN
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
THE
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
OF
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
AS
A
PEOPLE
WITH
A
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
THEY
CONSTITUTE
A
NATION
AND
HAVE
THE
SAME
RIGHT
AS
ANY
OTHER
PEOPLE
IN
THE
WORLD
TO
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
STATE
THE
SAME
RIGHT
AS
THE
ARMENIANS
HAVE
AS
THE
PALESTINIANS
HAVE
AS
THE
FRENCH
HAVE
AND
AS
ANYBODY
ELSE
HAVE
I
CANNOT
SAY
THAT
BY
ACCEPTING
A
DIFFERENT
GOD
SOMEONE
HAS
LOST
ALL
CULTURAL
IDENTIFICATION
