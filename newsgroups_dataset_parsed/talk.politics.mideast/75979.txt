A
AFIFI
WRITES
RESISTANCE
FIGHTERS
DONT
FORGET
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
FRENCH
RESISTANCE
TO
THE
NAZI
OCCUPYING
FORCES
WHICH
EVENTUALLY
SUCCEEDED
IN
DRIVING
OUT
THE
HOSTILE
OCCUPIERS
IN
WWII
AND
ALL
THIS
TIME
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
THE
US
BRITIAN
INVADING
NORMANDY
THE
CONSTANT
ROUND
THE
CLOCK
BOMBING
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
GERMANS
WERE
FIGHTING
ON
TWO
FRONTS
HOW
SILLY
OF
ME
THIS
IS
NOT
TO
DEVALUE
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
RESISTANCE
MOVEMENTS
BUT
RESISTANCE
MOVEMENTS
DID
NOT
DEFEAT
THE
NAZIS
DIPLOMACY
HAS
NOT
WORKED
WITH
ISRAEL
AND
THE
LEBANESE
PEOPLE
ARE
TIRED
OF
BEING
OCCUPIED
THEY
ARE
NOW
TURNING
TO
THE
ONLY
OPTION
THEY
SEE
AS
VIABLE
DONT
FORGET
THAT
IT
WORKED
IN
DRIVING
OUT
THE
US
ISRAEL
HAS
REPEATEDLY
STATED
THAT
IT
WILL
LEAVE
WHEN
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
SHOWS
THAT
IT
CAN
PREVENT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
AND
WHEN
THE
SYRIANS
AGREE
TO
LEAVE
THE
LEBANESE
HAVE
NOT
TRIED
DIPLOMACY
FOR
VERY
LONG
OR
MAYBE
THEYRE
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
GETTING
RID
OF
THE
SYRIANS
AND
IRANIANS
WHO
OCCUPY
THEIR
LAND
IF
THEY
CLOSED
DOWN
THE
HEZBOLAH
AND
NEGOTIATED
A
WITHDRAWL
OF
SYRIAN

ISRAEL
WOULD
BE
HAPPY
