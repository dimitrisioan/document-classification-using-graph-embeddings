RE
WASGO
HEZBOLLAH
I
WILL
TRY
TO
ANSWER
SOME
OF
DORINS
QUESTIONS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
NOT
ADDRESSED
TO
ME
SPECIFICALLY
BUT
I
FEEL
THAT
I
AM
A
BIT
CONCERNED
BY
THE
THREAD
SINCE
I
AM
A
SOUTHERN
LEBANESE
FROM
A
VILLAGE
THAT
IS
OFTEN
ON
THE
RECEIVING
END
OF
ISRAELS
BOMBS
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
THE
DEATH
OF
THREE
SOLDIERS
ON
A
PATROL
IN
OCCUPIED
LEBANESE
TERRRITORY
IS
NOT
AN
ACT
OF
TERRORISM
OR
MURDER
IT
IS
DISINGENEOUS
TO
COMPARE
THEIR
DEATH
TO
THAT
OF
ATHLETES
IN
MUNICH
OR
ANY
OTHER
ACT
OF
TERRORISM
OR
MRDER
THIS
EXERCISE
IS
AIMED
SOLELY
AT
DIVERTING
THE
ISSUE
AND
IS
FAR
FROM
THE
TRUTH
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
DORIN
THAT
YOU
ARE
SO
REMOTE
AND
IGNORANT
OF
THE
PROBLEM
ON
THE
GROUND
THAT
YOUR
COMMENTS
CAN
ONLY
BE
CHARACTRIZED
AS
IRRELEVANT
AND
HEAVILY
COLORED
BY
THE
PRECONCEPTIONS
AND
MISINFORMATION
I
WILL
TRY
TO
PAINT
THE
MOST
ACCURATE
PICTURE
I
CAN
OF
WHAT
THE
SITUATION
REALLY
IS
IN
SOUTH
LEBANON
IN
ARTICLE
STSSDXBSTUNOCALCOM
DORIN
BARU
WRITES
IS
THERE
ANY
ISRAELI
A
CIVILIAN
IN
YOUR
OPINION
NOW
I
DO
NOT
CONDONE
MYSELF
BOMBING
VILLAGES
ANY
KIND
OF
VILLAGES
BUT
YOU
CLAIM
THESE
ARE
VILLAGES
WITH
CIVILIANS
AND
IRAELIS
CLAIM
THEY
ARE
CAMPS
FILLED
WITH
TERRORISTS
YOU
CLAIM
THAT
ISRAELIS
SHELL
THE
VILLAGES
WITH
THE
HOPE
OF
FINDING
A
TERRORIST
OR
SO
IF
THEY
KILL
ONE
FINE
IF
NOT
TOO
BAD
CIVILIANS
DIE
RIGHT
I
AM
NOT
SO
SURE
I
AM
I
WAS
BACK
IN
MY
HOME
VILLAGE
THIS
LAST
SUMMER
FOR
YOUR
INFORMATION
WE
ARE
PEOPLE
NOT
A
BUNCH
OF
INDISCRIMINATE
TERRORISTS
MOST
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IN
MY
VILLAGE
ARE
REGULAR
INHABITANTS
THAT
GO
ABOUT
THEIR
DAILY
BUSINESS
SOME
WORK
IN
THE
FIELDS
SOME
OWN
SMALL
SHOPS
OTHERS
ARE
OLDER
MEN
THAT
GO
TO
THE
COFFE
SHOP
AND
DRINK
COFFEE
IS
THAT
SO
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
IT
IS
NOT
A
TERRORIST
CAMP
AS
YOU
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
LIKE
TO
VIEW
THE
VILLAGES
THEY
ARE
SMALL
COMMUNITIES
WITH
KIDS
PLAYING
SOCCER
IN
THE
STREETS
WOMEN
PREPARING
LUNCH
MEN
PLAYING
CARDS
ETC
SOME
YOUNG
MEN
USUALLY
AGED
BETWEEN
TO
YEARS
ARE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
EVEN
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
VILLAGE
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHO
THESE
ARE
THEY
ARE
SECRETIVE
ABOUT
IT
BUT
MOST
PEOPLE
OFTEN
SUSPECT
WHO
THEY
ARE
AND
WHAT
THEY
ARE
UP
TO
THESE
YOUNG
MEN
ARE
SUPPORTED
FINANCIALLY
BY
IRAN
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THEY
SNEAK
ARMS
AND
AMMUNITIONS
INTO
THE
OCCUPIED
ZONE
WHERE
THEY
SET
UP
BOOBY
TRAPS
FOR
ISRAELI
PATROLS
EVERY
TIME
AN
ISRAELI
SOLDIER
IS
KILLED
OR
INJURED
BY
THESE
TRAPS
ISRAEL
RETALLIATES
BY
INDISCRIMINATELY
BOMBING
VILLAGES
OF
THEIR
OWN
CHOOSING
OFTEN
KILLING
ONLY
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
ONCE
THEY
ARE
BACK
THEY
ANNOUNCE
THAT
THEY
BOMBED
A
TERRORIST
HIDEOUT
WHERE
AN
YEAR
OLD
GIRL
JUST
HAPPENED
TO
BE
WE
ARE
NOW
ACCUSTOMED
TO
ISRAELI
TACTICS
AND
WE
FIGURE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
ISRAELI
WAY
OF
TELLING
US
THAT
IF
YOURE
GONNA
HURT
OUR
SOLDIERS
YOURE
GONNA
PAY
THE
PRICE
WE
ACCEPT
THIS
AS
A
PRICE
WE
HAVE
TO
PAY
TO
FREE
OUR
LAND
ISRAEL
KNOWS
VERY
WELL
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
REALLY
HURTING
THE
RESISTANCE
THAT
MUCH
MILITARILY
WITH
THESE
STRIKES
BUT
RATHER
JUST
KEEPING
THE
PRESSURE
ON
THE
VILLAGERS
TO
DEMAND
FROM
THEIR
YOUNG
MEN
TO
STOP
ATTACKING
ISRAELI
SOLDIERS
SINCE
THESE
ATTACKS
ARE
TAKING
A
HEAVY
TOLL
ON
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
CIVILIAN
VILLAGERS
ISRAELS
RETALLIATION
POLICY
IS
COLD
HEARTED
BUT
A
REALITY
THAT
WE
HAVE
COME
TO
ACCEPT
AND
DEAL
WITH
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
STOP
ITS
ATTACKS
ON
OCCUPYING
ISRAELI
SOLDIERS
UNTIL
THEY
WITHDRAW
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
REAL
LEVERAGE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
FORCE
ISRAEL
TO
WITHDRAW
THE
PEOPLE
OF
SOUTH
LEBANON
ARE
OCCUPIED
OR
SHELLED
BY
ISRAEL
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
WE
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
BE
OCCUPIED
IF
ISRAEL
INSISTS
THAT
THE
SO
CALLED
SECURITY
ZONE
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
PROTECTION
OF
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
THAN
IT
WILL
HAVE
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
OF
ITS
OCCUPATION
WITH
THE
BLOOD
OF
ITS
SOLDIERS
IF
ISRAEL
IS
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
THAN
IT
SHOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
OUR
LAND
WE
ARE
NOT
ASKING
FOR
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
LEBANESE
OCCUPIED
ZONE
IN
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
TO
PROTECT
OUR
VILLAGES
THAT
ARE
ATTACKED
ON
A
REGULAR
BASIS
BY
ISRAEL
SO
THE
BEST
POLICY
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
REMOVAL
OF
ISRAELI
OCCUPATION
AND
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
PEACE
KEEPING
TROOPS
ALONG
THE
BORDER
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
BEFORE
ON
THIS
VERY
NEWSGROUP
THAT
THE
ONLY
REAL
SOLUTION
WILL
COME
AS
A
RESULT
OF
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PEACE
SETTLEMENT
WHEREBY
ISRAEL
WITHDRAWS
TO
ITS
OWN
BORDERS
AND
PEACE
KEEPING
TROOPS
ARE
STATIONED
ALONG
THE
BORDER
TO
INSURE
NO
ONE
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
BORDER
IS
SHELLED
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
REALISTIC
SOLUTION
IT
IS
TIME
FOR
ISRAEL
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
BUFFER
ZONE
AIMED
AT
PROTECTING
ITS
NORTHERN
CITIES
HAS
FAILED
IN
FACT
IT
HAS
CAUSED
MUCH
MORE
ISRAELI
DEATHS
THAN
THE
OCCASIONAL
SHELLING
OF
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
WOULD
HAVE
RESULTED
IN
IF
ISRAEL
REALLY
WANTS
TO
SAVE
SOME
ISRAELI
LIVES
IT
WOULD
WITHDRAW
UNILATERALLY
FROM
THE
SOCALLED
SECURITY
ZONE
BEFORE
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
THE
PEACE
TALKS
SUCH
A
MOVE
WOULD
SAVE
ISRAELI
LIVES
ADVANCE
PEACE
EFFORTS
GIVE
ISRAEL
A
GREAT
MORAL
LIFT
BETTER
ISRAELS
PUBLIC
IMAGE
ABROAD
AND
GIVE
IT
AN
EDGE
IN
THE
PEACE
NEGOCIATIONS
SINCE
ISRAEL
CAN
RIGHTLY
CLAIM
THAT
IT
IS
GENUINELY
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
AND
HAS
ALREADY
OFFERED
SOME
IMPORTANT
CONCESSIONS
ALONG
WITH
SUCH
A
WITHDRAWAL
ISRAEL
COULD
DEMAND
THAT
HIZBOLLAH
BE
DISARMED
BY
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
AND
WARN
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
ACCEPT
ANY
ATTACKS
AGAINST
ITS
NORTHERN
CITIES
AND
THAT
IF
SUCH
A
SHELLING
OCCURS
THAN
IT
WILL
CONSIDER
RETAKING
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
AND
WILL
HOLD
THE
LEBANESE
AND
SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
VERY
LITTLE
INCENTIVE
FOR
THE
SYRIAN
AND
LEBANESE
GOOVERNMENT
TO
ALLOW
HIZBOLLAH
TO
BOMB
ISRAEL
PROPER
UNDER
SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES
AND
NOW
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
PROVEN
THAT
IT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
CONTROLLING
AND
DISARMING
ALL
MILITIAS
AS
THEY
DID
IN
ALL
OTHER
PARTS
OF
LEBANON
IF
YOU
ASK
ME
THOSE
QUESTIONS
I
WILL
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
ANSWERING
NOT
WITH
A
QUESTION
AS
YOU
DID
NO
NOBODY
IS
QUALIFIED
CANDIDATE
FOR
MURDER
NOTHING
JUSTIFIES
MURDER
I
AGREE
ONLY
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
ISARELI
SOLDIERS
THEIR
KILLING
CANNOT
BE
QUALIFIED
AS
MURDER
NO
MATTER
WHAT
YOU
SAY
I
HAVE
THE
FEELING
THAT
YOU
MAY
BE
ABLE
YOURSELF
TO
MAKE
SIMILAR
STATEMENTS
MAYBE
AFTER
ELIMINATING
ALL
ISRAELIS
JEWS
AM
I
WRONG
YES
WE
HAVE
NO
QUARREL
WITH
JEWS
OR
ISRAELI
CIVILIANS
THE
REAL
PROBLEM
IS
WITH
OCCUPYING
ISRAELI
SOLDIERS
AND
THOSE
BRAVE
ISRAELI
PILOTS
THAT
BOMB
OUR
CIVILIAN
VILLAGES
EVERY
TIME
AN
OCCUPYING
SOLDIER
IS
ATTACKED
DORIN
BASIL
