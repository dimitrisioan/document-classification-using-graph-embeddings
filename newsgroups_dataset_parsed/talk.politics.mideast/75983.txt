here
since
you
are
replying
to
my
article
you
are
assuming
that
i
am
an
arab
well
im
not
an
arab
but
i
think
you
are
brain
is
full
of
shit
if
you
really
believe
what
you
said
the
bombardment
of
civilian
and
none
civilian
areas
in
lebanon
by
israel
is
very
consistent
with
its
policy
of
intimidation
that
is
the
only
policy
that
has
been
practiced
by
the
so
called
only
democracy
in
the
middle
east
i
was
merley
pointing
out
that
the
other
side
is
also
suffering
like
i
said
im
not
an
arab
but
if
i
was
say
a
lebanese
you
bet
i
would
defende
my
homeland
against
any
invader
by
any
means
the
syrians
iranian
agents
or
just
israeli
invaders
