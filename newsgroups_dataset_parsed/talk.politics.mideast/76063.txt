jewish
committee
on
the
middle
east
jcome
i
flipped
on
my
local
cable
access
channel
a
channel
where
any
community
member
can
broadcast
whatever
they
want
for
about
per
half
hour
and
saw
a
documentary
i
use
this
term
loosely
on
the
conflict
in
the
west
bank
it
was
apparently
made
with
a
hand
held
camcorder
the
quality
was
terrible
and
the
camera
was
really
jumpy
the
documentary
sic
told
the
tales
of
all
of
the
children
who
died
in
the
war
against
the
jews
as
martyrs
it
was
a
regular
sob
story
one
victimized
youth
was
recounting
on
how
all
he
really
wants
to
do
is
to
get
an
education
and
that
the
big
bad
jews
wont
let
him
go
to
high
school
he
admittedly
spent
years
in
prison
age
to
for
murdering
a
jewish
woman
but
claims
that
it
was
for
the
cause
i
have
seen
this
kind
of
garbage
before
i
have
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
the
palestinian
cause
as
do
many
jews
but
i
think
that
even
many
arabs
would
be
ashamed
to
call
this
a
documentary
the
most
suprising
part
is
that
the
only
credits
shown
at
the
end
was
an
address
for
the
makers
of
the
film
named
jewish
comm
on
the
middle
east
anybody
heard
of
them
they
make
peace
now
