my
reference
is
a
page
essay
in
our
local
star
tribute
newspaper
putting
the
whole
conflict
in
perspective
i
will
readily
admit
that
i
am
no
authority
in
this
area
however
other
posteers
asserted
that
some
muslims
did
join
hands
with
croats
and
nazis
in
persecuting
serbs
in
any
case
past
actions
do
not
and
the
best
evidence
you
can
find
is
second
hand
hearsay
from
an
unnamed
source
you
may
indeed
be
confusing
some
muslims
with
nazi
armenians
altogether
nazi
armenians
served
in
various
units
in
the
german
wehrmacht
according
to
ara
j
berkian
in
predominantly
armenian
army
units
in
german
army
units
in
various
working
units
and
in
the
amazing
how
the
discussions
change
from
one
topic
to
another
i
really
disagree
with
you
but
maybe
you
know
better
here
is
the
issue
at
hand
after
all
who
remembers
today
the
extermination
of
the
tartars

the

the

cleansing
by

killing
and
extermination
of
the
muslim
population
in

karabag
bosnia
and

is
an
islamic
holocaust
comparable
to
the
extermination
of
million
muslims
by
the
armenian
government
during

todays
ethnic

muslims
of
yugoslavia
as
well
as
the
soviet

against
the
muslim
population
of

azerbaijan
are
really
no
different
in
their
aspirations
than
the
genocide
perpetrated
by
the
armenian
government
years

against
the
turkish

closed
the
roads
and

that
might
serve
as
