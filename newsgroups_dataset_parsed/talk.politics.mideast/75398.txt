I
GET
THE
IMPRESSION
HASAN
REALIZED
HE
GOOFED
AND
IS
NOW
TRYING
TO
DROP
THE
THREAD
LET
HIM
IT
MIGHT
SAVE
SOME
MINISCULE
PORTION
OF
HIS
SORRY
FACE
NOT
REALLY
SINCE
I
AM
A
LOGICAL
PERSON
WHO
LIKES
FURTHERING
HIMSELF
FROM
ANY
NAME
CALLING
I
STARTED
TRASHING
ANY
ARTICLE
THAT
CONTAINS
SUCH
ABUSES
WITHOUT
RESPONDING
TO
AND
SOMETIMES
NOT
EVEN
READING
ARTICLES
WRITTEN
BY
THOSE
WHO
ACQUIRED
SUCH
BAD
HABITS
FROM
BAD
COMPANY
DELETED
STUFF
WELL
OK
LETS
SEE
WHAT
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
MR
JONAS
FLYGARE
WROTE
THAT
CAN
BE
WISDOMELY
RESPONDED
TO
ARE
YOU
CALLING
NAMES
OR
GIVING
ME
A
TITLE
IF
THE
FIRST
READ
YOUR
PARAGRAPH
ABOVE
IF
NOT
I
ACCEPT
THE
TITLE
IN
ORDER
TO
LET
YOU
GET
INTO
THE
UM
WELL
DEBATE
AGAIN
I
DIDNOT
KNOW
THAT
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
CAN
BE
NAME
CLLING
TOO
UNLESS
YOU
CONSIDER
YOURSELF
DESERVELESS
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
WRITES
IN
HASAN
FLAX
HASAN
IN
CASE
YOU
DIDNOT
KNOW
PALESTINEANS
WERE
THERE
FOR
MONTHS
AND
THEY
ARE
COMING
BACK
WHEN
YOU
AGREE
TO
GIVE
PALESTINEANS
THEIR
HUMANRIGHTS
AFTERALL
HUMAN
RIGHTS
ARENOT
NEGOTIABLE
CORRECT
ME
IF
IM
WRONG
BUT
ISNT
THE
RIGHT
TO
ONES
LIFE
ALSO
A
HUMAN
RIGHT
OR
DOES
IT
ONLY
APPLY
TO
PALESTINIANS
NO
IT
IS
EVERYBODYS
RIGHT
HOWEVER
WHEN
A
KILLER
KILLS
THEN
HE
IS
GIVING
UP
WILLINGLY
OR
UNWILLINGLY
HIS
LIFES
RIGHT
TO
THE
SOCIETY
THE
SOCIETY
REPRESENTED
BY
THE
GOVERMENT
WOULD
EXERCISE
ITS
DUTY
BY
DEPRIVING
THE
KILLER
OFF
HIS
LIFES
RIGHT
SO
THEN
ITS
ALL
RIGHT
FOR
ISRAEL
TO
KILL
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
KILL
ISRAELIS
THE
OLD
EYE
FOR
AN
EYE
THINKING
FUNNY
I
THOUGHT
MODERN
LEGAL
SYSTEMS
WERE
MADE
TO
COUNTER
EXACTLY
THAT
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
EXPECT
ME
TO
TELL
YOU
TO
TELL
YOU
MASTER
OF
WSIDOM
IF
YOU
INSIST
ON
GIVING
ME
NAMESTITLES
I
DID
NOT
ASK
FOR
YOU
COULD
AT
LEAST
SPELL
THEM
CORRECTLY
SIGH
THAT
WAS
ONLY
TO
CONFUSE
YOU
HA
HA
HA
HEY
WHEN
YOU
ARE
INTENTIONALLY
NEGLECTING
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
FACT
THAT
THE
WHOLE
ISRAELI
PRESENCE
IN
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
IS
ILLEGITIMATE
AND
HENCE
ALL
THEIR
ACTIONS
THEIR
COURTS
THEIR
LAWS
ARE
ILLEGITIMATE
ON
THE
GROUND
OF
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
NO
I
AM
NOT
NEGLECTING
THAT
IM
MERELY
ASKING
YOU
WHETHER
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
ISRAELI
CITICENS
IN
THE
WB
OR
IN
GAZA
INVALIDATES
THOSE
INDIVIDUALS
RIGHT
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
RETALIATE
AND
CONFUSE
ME
HERE
TO
LIVE
A
AS
YOU
SO
ELOQUENTLY
PUT
IT
HUMAN
RIGHT
WE
CAN
GET
BACK
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHICH
LAW
SHOULD
BE
USED
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
LATER
ALSO
YOU
HAVE
NOT
ADRESSED
MY
QUESTION
IF
THE
ISRAELIS
ALSO
HAVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
FIRST
MY
ABOVE
STATEMENT
DOESNOT
SAY
THAT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
IN
THE
WB
REVOKE
THEIR
RIGHT
OF
LIFE
BUT
IT
SAYS
THE
ISRAELI
OCCUPATION
OF
THE
WB
REVOKE
THE
RIGHT
OF
LIFE
FOR
SOMEMOST
ITS
CITIZENS
BASICALLY
REVOKES
THE
RIGHT
OF
FOR
ITS
MILITARY
MEN
CLEARLY
OCCUPATION
IS
AN
UNDECLARED
WAR
DURING
WAR
ATTACKS
AGAINST
MILITARY
TARGETS
ARE
FULLY
LEGITIMATE
SECONDLY
SURELY
ISRAELI
HAVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
BUT
THEY
ASK
THEIR
GOVERMENT
TO
PROTECT
IT
BY
WITHDRAWING
FROM
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRETORIES
NOT
BY
FURTHER
OPPRESSING
PALESTINEAN
HUMAN
RIGHTS
WHAT
DO
YOU
EXPECT
ME
TO
TELL
YOU
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
WHEN
I
DID
EXPLAIN
MY
POINT
IN
THE
POST
THAT
YOU
RESPONDED
TO
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
SINCE
ISRAEL
IS
OCCUPYING
THEN
IT
IS
AUTOMATICALLY
DEPRIVING
ITSELF
FROM
SOME
OF
ITS
RIGHTS
TO
THE
OCCUPIED
PALESTINEANS
WHICH
IS
EXACTLY
SIMILAR
THE
AUTOMATIC
DEPRIVATION
OF
A
KILLER
FROM
HIS
RIGHT
OF
LIFE
TO
THE
SOCIETY
IF
A
STATE
CAN
DEPRIVE
ALL
ITS
CITIZENS
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
BY
ITS
ACTIONS
THEN
TELL
ME
WHY
ANY
HUMAN
LIVING
TODAY
SHOULD
HAVE
ANY
RIGHTS
AT
ALL
BECAUSE
NOT
ALL
STATES
ARE
LIKE
ISRAEL
AS
OPPRESSIVE
AS
IGNORANT
OR
AS
TYRANT
WHAT
KIND
OF
RIGHTS
AND
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
BE
DEPRIVED
IS
ANOTHER
ISSUE
THE
ANSWER
IS
TO
BE
FOUND
IN
A
CERTAIN
SYSTEM
SUCH
AS
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
US
LAW
ISRAELI
LAW
DELETED
JONAS
WAS
THROWING
UPNOT
FOR
REAL
SO
YOU
CAN
STICK
TO
THE
SCREEN
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
US
LAW
REPRESENTED
BY
US
STATE
DEPT
IN
THIS
CASE
IS
LOOKING
TO
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
WHEN
VIOLENCE
OCCURS
IN
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
ANYWAY
AS
FOR
HAMAS
THEN
OBVIOUSLY
THEY
TURNED
TO
THE
ISLAMIC
SYSTEM
AND
WHICH
SYSTEM
DO
YOU
PROPOSE
WE
USE
TO
SOLVE
THE
ME
PROBLEM
THE
QUESTION
IS
NOT
WHICH
SYSTEM
WOULD
SOLVE
THE
ME
PROBLEM
WHY
BECAUSE
ANY
SYSTEM
CAN
SOLVE
IT
THE
LAWS
OF
MINISTER
SHARON
SAYS
KICK
PALESTINEANS
OUT
OF
HERE
ALL
PALESTINE
I
ASKED
FOR
WHICH
SYSTEM
SHOULD
BE
USED
THAT
WILL
PRESERVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
FOR
ALL
PEOPLE
INVOLVED
I
ASSUMED
THAT
WAS
OBVIOUS
BUT
I
WONT
REPEAT
THAT
MISTAKE
NOW
THAT
I
HAVE
STRAIGHTENED
THAT
OUT
IM
EAGERLY
AWAITING
YOUR
REPLY
SO
YOU
AGREE
THAT
THAT
AN
ISRAELI
SOLUTION
WOULDNOT
PRESERVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
I
AM
UNDERSTANDING
THIS
FROM
YOUR
FIRST
STATEMENT
IN
THIS
PARAGRAPH
JOSEPH
WEITZ
ADMINISTRATOR
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
JEWISH
COLONIZATION
SAID
IT
BEST
WHEN
WRITING
IN
HIS
DIARY
IN
BETWEEN
OURSELVES
IT
MUST
BE
CLEAR
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
ROOM
FOR
BOTH
PEOPLES
TOGETHER
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
WE
SHALL
NOT
ACHIEVE
OUR
GOAL
OF
BEING
AN
INDEPENDENT
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
ARABS
IN
THIS
SMALL
COUNTRY
THE
ONLY
SOLUTION
IS
A
PALESTINE
AT
LEAST
WESTERN
PALESTINE
WEST
OF
THE
JORDAN
RIVER
WITHOUT
ARABS
AND
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
THAN
TO
TRANSFER
THE
ARABS
FROM
HERE
TO
THE
NEIGHBOURING
COUNTRIES
TO
TRANSFER
ALL
OF
THEM
NOT
ONE
VILLAGE
NOT
ONE
TRIBE
SHOULD
BE
LEFT
ONLY
AFTER
THIS
TRANSFER
WILL
THE
COUNTRY
BE
ABLE
TO
ABSORB
THE
MILLIONS
OF
OUR
OWN
BRETHREN
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
OUT
DAVAR
SEPTEMBER
COURTESY
OF
MARC
AFIFI
JUST
A
QUESTION
IF
WE
ARE
TO
DISREGARD
THE
RATHER
OBVIOUS
REFERENCES
TO
GETTING
ISRAEL
OUT
OF
ME
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
IN
BOTH
PLO
COVENANT
AND
HAMAS
CHARTER
THATS
THE
ENGLISH
TRANSLATIONS
IF
YOU
HAVE
OTHER
INFORMATION
ID
BE
INTERESTED
TO
HAVE
YOU
TRANSLATE
IT
WHY
SHOULD
WE
GIVE
ANY
CREDENCE
TO
A
PRIVATE
PAPER
EVEN
OLDER
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
GET
INTO
THE
QUESTION
IF
HE
WROTE
THE
ABOVE
BUT
ITS
FAIRLY
OBVIOUS
ALL
PARTIES
IN
THE
CONFLICT
HAVE
THEIR
SHARE
OF
FANATICS
GUESS
WHAT
THOSE
ARE
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WILL
MAKE
ANY
LASTING
PEACE
IN
THE
REGION
MORE
DELETED
STUFF
EXACTLY
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
I
GUESS
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERMENT
IS
FULL
WITH
MEN
LIKE
JOSEPH
WEITZ
WE
AND
OUR
EITHER
REFERS
TO
ZIONISTS
OR
JEWS
I
DONOT
KNOW
WHICH
WELL
I
CAN
GIVE
YOU
AN
ANSWER
YOU
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
I
WILL
NOT
SUGGEST
THE
IMPERIALIST
ISRAELI
SYSTEM
FOR
SOLVING
THE
ME
PROBLEM
I
THINK
THAT
IS
FAIR
ENOUGH
NO
THAT
IS
NOT
AN
ANSWER
SINCE
I
ASKED
FOR
A
SYSTEM
THAT
COULD
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
YOU
SAID
ANY
COULD
BE
USED
THEN
YOU
PROVIDED
A
CONTRADICTION
ABOVE
YOU
WROTE
THAT
YOU
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
I
MEANT
UNDERLINED
BY
ANY
SYSTEM
CAN
BE
USED
TO
SOLVE
THE
CONFLICT
BUT
NOT
ANY
SYSTEM
WOULD
RESOLVE
IT
JUSTLY
GUESS
WHERE
THAT
TAKES
YOUR
LOGIC
TO
NEVERNEVER
LAND
YOU
ARE
PROVING
YOURSELF
AS
A
FIRST
YOU
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
I
MEANT
BUT
THEN
YOU
CLAIM
YOU
DIDNOT
SO
TO
CLAIM
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
MY
LOGIC
TOO
BAD
FOR
YOU
THE
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
THE
GREATEST
PROBLEM
OF
ZIONISM
IS
ARAB
CHILDREN
RABBI
SHOHAM
OH
AND
BY
THE
WAY
LET
ME
ADD
THAT
THESE
CUTE
QUOTES
YOU
PUT
AT
THE
END
ARE
A
REAL
BUMMER
WHEN
I
TRY
GIVING
YOUR
POSTS
ANY
CREDIT
WHY
DO
YOU
FEEL
ASHAMED
BY
THINGS
AND
FACTS
THAT
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
IF
YOU
WERE
A
ZIONISTS
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
ZIONIST
CODES
AND
ACTS
WELL
I
FEEL
SORRY
FOR
YOU
BECAUSE
THE
SAME
RABBI
SHOHAM
HAD
SAID
YES
ZIONISM
IS
RACISM
IF
YOU
FEEL
ASHAMED
AND
BOTHERED
BY
THE
ZIONIST
CODES
THEN
DROP
ZIONISM
IF
YOU
ARE
NOT
ZIONIST
WHY
ARE
YOU
BOTHERED
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
JOIN
ME
IN
CONDEMNING
THESE
RACIST
ZIONIST
CODES
AND
ACTS
