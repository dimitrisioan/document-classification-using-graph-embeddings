and
if
you
are
jewish
you
are
a
selfhating
jew
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
this
there
are
doubts
about
it
why
dont
you
define
what
selfhating
jew
means
i
found
the
idea
itself
of
being
a
selfhating
jew
to
be
one
of
those
rediculous
things
that
people
repeat
and
repeat
because
it
seems
to
have
a
meaning
when
in
fact
it
has
none
i
hope
you
can
come
up
with
a
definition
in
itself
and
not
something
like
look
at
this
person
that
is
a
selfhating
jew

of
wrong
done
to
other
people
a

that
is
why
i
get
moved
when
i
see
the
israeli
army
killing
people
in
the
occupied
territories
as
much
as
i
get
moved
when
i
see
a
plestinian
stabing
people
in
israel
