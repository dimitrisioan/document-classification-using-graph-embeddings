what
gives
isreal
the
right
to
keep
jeruseleum
it
is
the
home
of
the
muslim
a
s
well
as
jewish
religion
among
others
heck
nobody
ever
mentions
what
yitza
k
shamir
did
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
which
is
terrorize
westerners
much
in
the
way
abdul
nidal
does
today
seems
isrealis
are
nowhere
above
arabs
so
theref
ore
they
have
a
right
to
jerusaleum
as
much
as
isreal
does
there
is
one
big
difference
between
israel
and
the
arabs
christians
in
this
respect
israel
allows
freedom
of
religion
avi

your
information
islam
permits
freedom
of
religion
there
is
no
compulsion
in
religion
does
judaism
permit
freedom
of
religion
ie
are
nonjews
recognized
in
judaism
just
wondering
