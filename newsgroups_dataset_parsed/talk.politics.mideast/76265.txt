RE
DESERTIFICATION
OF
THE
NEGEV
THIS
IS
NONSENSE
I
LIVED
IN
THE
NEGEV
FOR
MANY
YEARS
AND
I
CAN
SAY
FOR
SURE
THAT
NO
BEDUINS
WERE
MOVED
OR
HARMED
IN
ANY
WAY
ON
THE
CONTRARY
THEIR
STANDARD
OF
LIVING
HAS
CLIMBED
SHARPLY
MANY
OF
THEM
NOW
LIVE
IN
RATHER
NICE
PERMANENT
HOUSES
AND
OWN
CARS
THERE
ARE
QUITE
A
FEW
BEDUIN
STUDENTS
IN
THE
BENGURION
UNIVERSITY
THERE
ARE
GOOD
FRIENDLY
RELATIONS
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
POPULATION
ALL
THE
BEDUINS
I
MET
WOULD
BE
RATHER
SURPRISED
TO
READ
MR
DAVIDSONS
POSTER
I
HAVE
TO
SAY
