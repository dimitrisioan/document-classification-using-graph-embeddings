congratulations
to
the
brave
men
of
the
lebanese
resistance
with
every
israeli
son
that
you
place
in
the
grave
you
are
underlining
the
moral
bankruptcy
of
israels
occupation
and
drawing
attention
to
the
israeli
governments
policy
of
reckless
disregard
for
civilian
life
apparently
the
hizbollah
were
encouraged
by
brads
cheers
good
job
brad
someone
forgot
to
tell
them
though
that
brad
asks
them
to
place
only
israeli
sons
in
the
grave
not
daughters
paraphrasing
a
bit
with
every
rocket
that
the
hizbollah
fires
on
the
galilee
they
justify
israels
holding
to
the
security
zone
