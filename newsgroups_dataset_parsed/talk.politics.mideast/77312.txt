WHY
IS
IT
THEN
THAT
WHEN
THE
BRITISH
IRANIANS
AND
UAE
REFER
TO
OCCUPIED
TERRITORY
THEY
MEAN
TERRITORY
IN
DISPUTE
IN
ISRAEL
BUT
NOT
IN
THEIR
OWN
AFFAIRS
I
SUPPOSE
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
JEWS
CALL
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORY
JUDEA
AND
SUMARIA
ITS
CALLED
PROPAGANDA
AND
IF
YOU
REPEAT
LIES
OFTEN
ENOUGH
PEOPLE
START
TO
BELIEVE
IT
