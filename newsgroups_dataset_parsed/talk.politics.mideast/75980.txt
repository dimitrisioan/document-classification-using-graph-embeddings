RE
WASGO
HEZBOLLAH
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
MOST
OF
BRADS
POST
DELETED
WE
HAVE
COME
TO
ACCEPT
AND
DEAL
WITH
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
NOT
GOING
TO
STOP
ITS
ATTACKS
ON
OCCUPYING
ISRAELI
SOLDIERS
UNTIL
THEY
WITHDRAW
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
REAL
LEVERAGE
THAT
THEY
HAVE
TO
FORCE
ISRAEL
TO
WITHDRAW
TELL
ME
DO
THESE
YOUNG
MEN
ALSO
ATTACK
SYRIAN
TROOPS
WITH
THE
BLOOD
OF
ITS
SOLDIERS
IF
ISRAEL
IS
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
THAN
IT
SHOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
OUR
LAND
THERE
MUST
BE
A
GUARANTEE
OF
PEACE
BEFORE
THIS
HAPPENS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MANY
OF
THESE
LEBANESE
YOUTH
ARE
UNABLE
TO
RESTRAIN
THEMSELVES
FROM
VIOLENCE
AND
UNABLE
TO
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THEIR
ACTIONS
PROLONG
ISRAELS
STAY
IN
SOUTH
LEBANON
IF
THE
LEBANESE
ARMY
WAS
ABLE
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
PEACE
THEN
ISRAEL
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
BE
THERE
UNTIL
IT
IS
ISRAEL
PREFERS
THAT
ITS
SOLDIERS
DIE
RATHER
THAN
ITS
CHILDREN
IF
ISRAEL
REALLY
WANTS
TO
SAVE
SOME
ISRAELI
LIVES
IT
WOULD
WITHDRAW
UNILATERALLY
FROM
THE
SOCALLED
SECURITY
ZONE
BEFORE
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
THE
PEACE
TALKS
SUCH
A
MOVE
WOULD
SAVE
ISRAELI
LIVES
ADVANCE
PEACE
EFFORTS
GIVE
ISRAEL
A
GREAT
MORAL
LIFT
BETTER
ISRAELS
PUBLIC
IMAGE
ABROAD
AND
GIVE
IT
AN
EDGE
IN
THE
PEACE
NEGOCIATIONS
SINCE
ISRAEL
CAN
RIGHTLY
CLAIM
THAT
IT
IS
GENUINELY
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
AND
HAS
ALREADY
OFFERED
SOME
IMPORTANT
CONCESSIONS
ISRAEL
SHOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
LEBANON
WHEN
A
PEACE
TREATY
IS
SIGNED
NOT
A
DAY
BEFORE
WITHDRAW
BECAUSE
OF
CASUALTIES
WOULD
TELL
THE
LEBANESE
PEOPLE
THAT
ALL
THEY
NEED
TO
DO
TO
PUSH
ISRAEL
AROUND
IS
KILL
A
FEW
SOLDIERS
ITS
NOT
GONNA
HAPPEN
ALONG
WITH
SUCH
A
WITHDRAWAL
ISRAEL
COULD
DEMAND
THAT
HIZBOLLAH
BE
DISARMED
BY
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
AND
WARN
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
ACCEPT
ANY
ATTACKS
AGAINST
ITS
NORTHERN
CITIES
AND
THAT
IF
SUCH
A
SHELLING
OCCURS
THAN
IT
WILL
CONSIDER
RETAKING
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
AND
WILL
HOLD
THE
LEBANESE
AND
SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
WHY
SHOULD
ISRAEL
NOT
DEMAND
THIS
WHILE
HOLDING
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
BETTER
BARGAINING
POSITION
IS
WHILE
HOLDING
YOUR
NEIGHBORS
LAND
IF
LEBANON
WERE
WILLING
TO
AGREE
TO
THOSE
CONDITIONS
ISRAEL
WOULD
QUITE
PROBABLY
HAVE
LEFT
ALREADY
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
THAT
THE
LEBANESE
CAN
DISARM
THE
HIZBOLAH
AND
MAINTAIN
THE
PEACE

WE
HAD
A

BIG
ENOUGH
FOR
DRUGS
AND
SEXUAL
FAVORS
WE
SURE
WOULDNT
WASTE
THEM
ON
