I
DONT
KNOW
WHETHER
ANYBODY
FORMULATED
AND
PROPOSED
SUCH
AN
INDEX
OR
CRITERIA
TO
DETERMINE
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
A
GENOCIDE
AS
MENTIONED
AND
ADVISED
BY
TOYNBEE
IF
ONE
EVER
DOES
YOU
WILL
EASILY
SEE
THE
MAGNITUDE
OF
THE
CRIME
OF
GENOCIDE
COMMITTED
BY
THE
ARMENIANS
BY
MASSACRING
AN
ALIEN
POPULATION
UNDER
THEIR
RULE
WHICH
CONSTITUTED
ABOUT
OF
THEIR
TOTAL
POPULATION
AND
THEY
DID
IT
ONLY
WITHIN
A
TIME
PERIOD
OF
A
LITTLE
OVER
TWO
YEARS
IN
WHICH
THEY
ENJOYED
HAVING
FULL
CONTROL
OVER
THIS
POPULATION
NOW
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
YOU
IS
THERE
ANY
OTHER
GENOCIDE
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
MANKIND
SIMILAR
TO
THIS
ONE
AND
AGAIN
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
YOU
WHETHER
THE
SILENT
AND
UNMOURNED
MARTYRDOM
OF
THESE
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
TURKS
OF
THE
REPUBLIC
OF
ARMENIA
WHO
WERE
EXTERMINATED
AS
A
FINAL
SOLUTION
TO
TURCOTARTAR
PROBLEMS
IN
ARMENIA
IS
SIMILAR
OR
NOT
TO
THE
MARTYRDOM
OF
SIX
MILLION
JEWS
IN
EUROPE
AS
A
FINAL
SOLUTION
TO
JEWISH
PROBLEMS
SERDAR
ARGIC
WE
CLOSED
THE
ROADS
AND
MOUNTAIN
PASSES
THAT
MIGHT
SERVE
AS
WAYS
OF
ESCAPE
FOR
THE
TURKS
AND
THEN
PROCEEDED
IN
THE
WORK
OF
EXTERMINATION
OHANUS
APPRESSIAN
IN
