TAMAMIDIS
WRITES
YEAH
TOO
MUCH
MUTLUARGIC
ISNT
HELPING
I
COULD
ONE
DAY
PROCEED
AND
YOU
SHOULDNT
THINK
MANY
TURKS
READ
MUTLUARGIC
STUFF
THEY
ARE
IN
MY
KILL
FILE
LIKEWISE
ANY
OTHER
FANATIC
I
HAVE
NOTHING
AGAINST
GREEKS
BUT
MY
PROBLEM
IS
WITH
FANATICS
I
HAVE
MET
SO
MANY
GREEKS
WHO
WOULDNT
EVEN
TALK
TO
ME
BECAUSE
I
AM
TURKISH
FROM
MY
EXPERIENCE
ALL
MY
FRIENDS
ALWAYS
WERE
OPEN
TO
GREEKS
WELL
THE
HISTORY
WARS
CURRENT
SITUATIONS
ALL
OF
THEM
DO
NOT
HELP
WELL
PANOS
MR
TAMAMIDIS
THE
WAY
YOU
PUT
IT
IT
IS
ONLY
THE
TURKS
WHO
BEAR
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
THE
THINGS
HAPPENING
TODAY
THAT
IS
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
FOR
SOMEBODY
TRYING
TO
BE
OBJECTIVE
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
CONFLICTS
LIKE
OUR
COUNTRIES
HAVING
YOU
CANNOT
BLAME
ONE
SIDE
ONLY
THERE
ALWAYS
ARE
BAD
GUYS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
WHAT
WERE
YOU
DOING
ON
ANATOLIA
AFTER
THE
ANYWAY
DO
YOU
THINK
IT
WAS
YOUR
RIGHT
TO
BE
THERE
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
CONFLICTS
STARTED
WITH
THAT
IT
IS
ONLY
NOT
ONE
SIDE
BEING
THE
AGGRESSIVE
AND
THE
ITHER
ALWAYS
SUFFERING
IT
IS
SAD
THAT
WE
BOTH
STILL
ARE
NOT
TRYING
TO
COMPROMISE
I
REMEMBER
THE
ACTION
OF
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
BY
REMOVING
THE
VISA
REQUIREMENT
FOR
GREEKS
TO
COME
TO
TURKEY
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
A
POSITIVE
ATTEMPT
TO
MAKE
THE
RELATIONS
BETTER
THE
GREEKS
I
MENTIONED
WHO
WOULDNT
TALK
TO
ME
ARE
EDUCATED
PEOPLE
THEY
HAVE
NEVER
MET
ME
BUT
THEY
KNOW
I
AM
BAD
PERSON
BECAUSE
I
AM
FROM
TURKEY
POLITICS
IS
NOT
MY
BUSINESS
AND
IT
IS
NOT
THE
BUSINESS
OF
MOST
OF
THE
TURKS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
INDIVIDUALS
WHY
THE
HATRED
SO
THAT
MAKES
ME
THINK
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
BRAINWASHING
GOING
ON
IN
GREECE
AFTER
ALL
WHY
WOULD
AN
EDUCATED
PERSON
TREAT
EVERY
PERSON
FROM
A
NATION
THE
SAME
WAY
CAN
YOU
TELL
ME
ABOUT
YOUR
HISTORY
BOOKS
AND
THINGS
YOU
LEARN
ABOUT
GREEKTURKISH
ENCOUNTERS
DURING
YOUR
SCHOOLING
