who
wrote
h
the
armenians
in
nagarnokarabagh
are
simply
defending
their
rights
h
to
keep
their
homeland
and
it
is
the
azeris
that
are
invading
their
h
territorium
he
homeland
first
nagarnokarabagh
was
armenians
homeland
today
he
fizuli
lacin
and
several
villages
in
azerbadjan
he
are
their
homeland
cant
you
see
the
he
the
great
armenia
dream
in
this
greater
armenia
would
stretch
from
karabakh
to
the
black
sea
to
the
mediterranean
so
if
you
use
the
term
greater
armenia
use
it
with
care
he
with
facist
methods
like
he
killing
raping
and
bombing
villages
the
last
move
was
the
he
blast
of
a
truck
with
kurdish
refugees
trying
to
he
escape
the
from
lacin
a
city
that
was
given
to
the
kurds
he
by
the
armenians
it
has
always
been
up
to
the
azeris
to
end
their
announced
winning
of
karabakh
by
removing
the
armenians
when
the
president
of
azerbaijan
elchibey
came
to
power
last
year
he
announced
he
would
be
be
swimming
in
lake
sevan
in
armeniaxn
by
july
well
he
was
wrong
if
elchibey
is
going
to
shell
the
armenians
of
karabakh
from
aghdam
his
people
will
pay
the
price
if
elchibey
is
going
to
shell
karabakh
from
fizuli
his
people
will
pay
the
price
if
elchibey
thinks
he
can
get
away
with
bombing
armenia
from
the
hills
of
kelbajar
his
people
will
pay
the
price
it
also
seems
other
nonazeri
minorities
in
azerbaijan
have
understood
they
are
next
in
line
in
this
process
of
forced
azerification
or
deportation
just
look
at
the
situation
with
the
lezgians
about
the
kurdswhat
kurds
according
to
the
azerbaijani
government
there
are
no
kurds
in
azerbaijan
cant
they
make
up
their
minds
oh
i
see
there
are
only
kurds
when
the
azeris
want
them
to
be
kurds
and
anyway
this
kurd
refugee
story
as
have
other
stories
are
simple
fabrications
sourced
in
baku
modified
in
ankara
other
examples
of
this
are
armenia
has
no
border
with
iran
and
the
ridiculous
story
of
the
intercepting
of
armenian
military
conversations
as
appeared
in
the
new
york
times
supposedly
translated
by
somebody
unknown
from
armenian
into
azeri
turkish
submitted
by
an
unnamed
special
correspondent
to
the
ny
times
from
baku
real
accurate
h
however
i
hope
that
the
armenians
will
force
a
turkish
airplane
h
to
land
for
purposes
of
searching
for
arms
similar
to
the
one
h
that
happened
last
summer
turkey
searched
an
american
plane
h
carrying
humanitarian
aid
bound
to
armenia
h
no
henrik
these
turkish
planes
should
be
shot
down
with
no
questions
asked
he
dont
speak
about
things
you
dont
know
american
cargo
planes
he
were
heading
to
armenia
when
the
turkish
authorities
he
announced
that
they
were
going
to
search
these
cargo
he
planes
of
these
planes
returned
to
its
base
in
germany
he
of
these
planes
were
searched
in
turkey
the
content
of
he
of
the
other
planes
not
hard
to
guess
is
it
it
was
sure
not
he
humanitarian
aid
your
facts
in
error
shipments
of
all
kinds
that
have
transversed
turkey
have
been
either
searched
rerouted
or
confiscated
some
american
planes
were
searched
others
were
rerouted
others
were
untouched
rail
shipments
were
held
up
last
fall
and
last
winter
from
entering
armenian
from
turkey
for
the
purpose
of
aiding
in
the
economic
collapse
of
armenia
wheat
was
confiscated
other
shipments
were
exchanged
with
crap
and
dirt
then
shipped
to
armenia
us
planes
dont
have
to
use
turkish
air
bases
the
us
uses
these
bases
to
bomb
iraq
anyway
us
planes
can
fly
over
georgia
which
they
have
found
is
easier
than
to
endure
unnecessary
expressions
of
turkish
chauvinism
through
searches
of
cargo
which
to
this
day
have
not
revealed
anything
other
than
a
paranoid
turkish
military
he
search
turkish
planes
you
dont
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
since
its
content
is
announced
to
be
weapons
well
big
mouth
ozal
said
military
weapons
are
being
provided
to
azerbaijan
from
turkey
yet
demirel
and
others
say
no
no
wonder
you
are
so
confused
he
turkeys
government
has
announced
that
its
giving
weapons
he
to
azerbadjan
since
armenia
started
to
attack
azerbadjan
he
it
self
not
the
karabag
province
so
why
search
a
plane
for
weapons
he
since
its
content
is
announced
to
be
weapons
you
are
correct
all
turkish
planes
should
be
simply
shot
down
nice
slow
moving
air
transports
