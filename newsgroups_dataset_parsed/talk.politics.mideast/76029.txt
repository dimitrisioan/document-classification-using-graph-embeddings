THE

SO
IF

GREATER
ARMENIA
USE
IT
WITH
CARE
HE
WITH
FACIST
METHODS
LIKE
HE
KILLING
RAPING
AND
BOMBING

THE
LAST
MOVE
WAS
THE
HE
BLAST
OF
A
TRUCK
WITH
KURDISH
REFUGEES
TRYING
TO
HE
ESCAPE
THE
FROM
LACIN
A
CITY
THAT
WAS
GIVEN
TO
THE
KURDS
HE
BY
THE
ARMENIANS
IT
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
UP
TO
THE
AZERIS
TO
END
THEIR
ANNOUNCED
WINNING
OF
KARABAKH
BY
REMOVING
THE
ARMENIANS
WHEN
THE
PRESIDENT
OF

ELCHIBEY
CAME

LAST

HE
ANNOUNCED
HE
WOULD
BE
BE
SWIMMING
IN
LAKE
SEVAN
IN

BY

SHELL
THE
ARMENIANS
OF
KARABAKH
FROM

HIS
PEOPLE
WILL
PAY
THE
PRICE
IF
ELCHIBEY
IS
GOING
TO
SHELL
KARABAKH
FROM
FIZULI
HIS

WILL
PAY
THE

IF
ELCHIBEY
THINKS
HE
CAN
GET
AWAY
WITH

ARMENIA
FROM
THE

OF
KELBAJAR
HIS

IT
ALSO
SEEMS
OTHER
NONAZERI
MINORITIES
IN
AZERBAIJAN
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
THEY
ARE
NEXT
IN
LINE
IN
THIS
PROCESS
OF
FORCED
AZERIFICATION
OR
DEPORTATION
JUST
LOOK
AT
THE
SITUATION
WITH
THE
LEZGIANS
ABOUT
THE
KURDSWHAT
KURDS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
AZERBAIJANI
GOVERNMENT
THERE
ARE
NO
KURDS
IN
AZERBAIJAN
CANT
THEY
MAKE
UP
THEIR
MINDS
OH
I
SEE
THERE
ARE
ONLY
KURDS
WHEN
THE
AZERIS
WANT
THEM
TO
BE
KURDS
AND
ANYWAY
THIS
KURD
REFUGEE
STORY
AS
HAVE
OTHER
STORIES
ARE
SIMPLE
FABRICATIONS
SOURCED
IN
BAKU
MODIFIED
IN
ANKARA
OTHER
EXAMPLES
OF
THIS
ARE
ARMENIA
HAS
NO
BORDER
WITH
IRAN
AND
THE
RIDICULOUS
STORY
OF
THE
INTERCEPTING
OF
ARMENIAN
MILITARY
CONVERSATIONS
AS
APPEARED
IN
THE
NEW

SUPPOSEDLY
TRANSLATED

TURKISH
SUBMITTED
BY
AN
UNNAMED
SPECIAL

TO
THE

FROM

REAL
ACCURATE
H
HOWEVER
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
WILL
FORCE
A
TURKISH
AIRPLANE
H
TO
LAND
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
SEARCHING
FOR
ARMS
SIMILAR
TO
THE
ONE
H
THAT

LAST

TURKEY
SEARCHED
AN

H
NO

THESE
TURKISH

SHOULD
BE
SHOT
DOWN
WITH

DONT

YOU
DONT

AMERICAN
CARGO
PLANES
HE
WERE
HEADING

WHEN
THE

HE

HE
OF

THE

SOME

US

THE

ANYWAY
US
