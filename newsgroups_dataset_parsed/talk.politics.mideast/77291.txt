i
find
it
interesting
that
mr
major
finds
the
genocide
of
two
million
muslims
in
bosnia
acceptable
now
you
are
actually
claiming
that
muslims
have
been
killed
in
bh
please
substantiate
this
utterly
ridiculous
claim
no
im
not
claiming
have
been
killed
we
are
in
the
middle
of
the
genocide
process
that
mr
major
has
given
yet
another
green
light
to
mladic
seems
to
have
most
of
what
he
wants
but
boban
is
just
getting
his
appetite
whetted
because
mladic
refuses
to
allow
international
observers
to
inspect
massgrave
sites
and
killing
centers
in
places
like
foca
brcko
and
visegrad
it
will
be
years
before
we
have
an
accurate
account
of
the
number
killed
in
practical
terms
it
would
be
impossible
to
kill
all
there
just
isnt
the
kind
of
machinery
of
crematoria
and
gas
chambers
and
transportation
lines
that
the
nazis
took
years
to
develop
and
remember
the
nazis
killed
minorities
in
the
countries
they
occupied
to
actually
kill
of
the
population
requires
extreme
genocidal
organization
but
i
do
claim
that
the
goal
of
the
genocide
is
the
systematic
annihilation
of
bosnian
muslim
culture
by
killing
as
many
as
is
feasible
by
rape
by
torture
by
the
demolition
of
mosques
libraries
and
culture
artificts
the
burning
and
renaming
of
villages
the
shelling
of
civilians
so
that
there
wont
be
any
of
the
or
so
muslims
whose
lives
have
not
been
shattered
by
the
genocide
though
they
still
may
be
alive
and
mr
major
not
only
finds
this
acceptable
he
helps
it
along
by
making
sure
that
the
victims
dont
have
arms
to
defend
themselves
