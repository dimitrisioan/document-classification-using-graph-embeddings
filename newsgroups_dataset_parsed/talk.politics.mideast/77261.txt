WRITES
AS
THE
THE
PEACE
TALKS
RESUME
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
I
WOULD
HUMBLY
LIKE
TO
MAKE
SOME
PERSONAL
OBSERVATIONS
AS
TO
THEIR
PROSPECTS
OF
SUCCESS
OR
FAILURE
AND
WHATS
AT
STAKE
THE
PRESENT
TALKS
WERE
SUSPENDED
FOR
OVER
MONTHS
AFTER
THE
ISRAELI
EXPULSION
OF
MORE
THE
PALESTINIANS
FOR
ALLEGED
LINKS
WITH
THE
EXTREMIST
ISLAMIC
ORGANISATION
HAMAS
THE
FUTURE
OF
THE
TALKS
WAS
IN
THE
BALANCE
AND
THEIR
CONTINUANCE
WAS
ONLY
GUARANTEED
AFTER
SOME
CONCESSIONS
BY
ISRAEL
NOW
THAT
ALL
THE
PARTIES
ARE
BACK
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
THE
STAKES
AS
I
SEE
IS
ARE
INDEED
HIGH
AND
THE
FUTURE
STABILITY
OF
THE
REGION
AND
PERHAPS
THE
WORLD
IS
IN
THE
BALANCE
THE
RESUMPTION
OF
THE
TALKS
WAS
FOLLOWED
BY
A
GOODWILL
GESTURE
BY
ISRAEL
INVOLVING
THE
RETURN
OF
EXILED
PALESTINIANS
FROM
JORDAN
TO
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
THESE
HOWEVER
WERE
NOT
THE
PALESTINIANS
EXPELLED
IN
DECEMBER
THE
GROUP
CONSTITUTED
INTELLECTUALS
AND
PROFESSIONALS
WHO
HAD
BEEN
EXILED
AFTER
THE
WAR
FOR
THE
POLITICAL
STAND
WHICH
WAS
THEN
REGARDED
AS
DANGEROUS
THE
CHOICE
OF
THESE
ARABS
WHO
SUPPORT
THE
PEACE
TALKS
ILLUSTRATES
THE
DILEMMA
NOW
FACED
BY
ISRAEL
ITS
ERSTWHILE
ARCH
ENEMIES
IE
PLO
AND
ITS
BACKERS
NOW
SEEM
WILLING
TO
TALK
PEACE
WHILE
A
NEW
WAVE
OF
ISLAMIC
FUNDAMANTALISM
SWEEPING
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
HAS
SEEN
THE
RISE
OF
AN
EVEN
MORE
IMPLACABLE
FOE
UNDER
THE
BANNER
OF
HAMAS
WHILE
ISRAEL
CONTINUES
TO
REFUSE
TO
TALK
TO
THE
PLO
LABELLING
IT
A
TERRORIST
ORGANISATION
THE
WINDOW
OF
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
PEACE
IS
NARROWING
BY
THE
DAY
IF
THE
PRESENT
TALKS
ARE
ALLOWED
TO
DEADLOCK
WITHOUT
AGREEMENT
FOR
A
LONG
TERM
AND
LASTING
PEACE
THAT
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
INTEREST
OF
ALL
INVOLVED
THE
CHANCES
OF
PEACE
WILL
INDEED
RECEED
THE
PLO
BY
ITS
DECISION
TO
REJOIN
THE
TALKS
HAS
STAKED
ITS
REPUTATION
ON
THE
SUCCESS
OF
THE
TALKS
THE
LONGER
THE
TALKS
CONTINUE
AND
THEY
STARTED
AND
HALF
YEARS
AGO
WITHOUT
ANY
TANGIBLE
PROGRESS
THE
FURTHER
WILL
THE
PLO
SUPPORT
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
ERODE
WHAT
IS
URGENTLY
NEEDED
IS
SOME
DRAMATIC
GESTURE
WORKED
OUT
BY
ISRAEL
WITH
US
APPROVAL
THAT
COULD
SPUR
THE
PEACE
PROCESS
AND
FORCE
THE
ARABS
AND
PALESTINIANS
TO
RECIPROCATE
VAGUE
PROMISES
AS
TO
INTERIM
GOVERNMENT
AND
RETURN
OF
TERRITORIES
IS
EVIDENTLY
TOO
LITTLE
TOO
LATE
TO
BE
ANY
GOOD
YOU
MIGHT
ASK
WHY
MUST
THE
ISRAELIS
AND
NOT
THE
ARABS
MAKE
THE
FIRST
SUBSTANTIVE
MOVES
THE
ANSWER
MUST
LIE
IN
THE
TENOUS
SUPPORT
AT
BEST
THAT
THE
TALKS
RECEIVE
AMONG
THE
MASS
OF
ARAB
PEOPLE
AND
THE
FACT
THE
ISRAEL
HOLDS
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
CARDS
NAMELY
LAND
IF
A
LAND
FOR
PEACE
AGREEMENT
CAN
BE
REACHED
AND
REAL
SOON
THE
CHANCES
OF
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PEACE
TREATY
IS
GOOD
THE
ARABS
ONCE
AND
FOR
ALL
RECOGNISE
ISRAELS
RIGHT
TO
EXIST
INSIDE
SECURE
BORDERS
AND
ISREAL
WOULD
IN
TURN
RECOGNISE
THE
LEGITIMATE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PALESTINIANS
TO
SELF
DETERNIMATION
AND
STATEHOOD
WITH
PEACE
GUARANTEE
BY
AIR
TIGHT
TREATIES
THE
REGION
CAN
THEN
HOPE
TO
DWELL
ON
THE
ECONOMIC
AND
SOCIAL
WELL
BEING
OF
ITS
POPULATION
RATHER
THAN
PREPARE
FOR
THE
NEXT
WAR
