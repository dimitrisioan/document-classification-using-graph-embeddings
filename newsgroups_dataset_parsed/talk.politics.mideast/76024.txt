israel
was
able
to
divert
the
jewish
lobby
from
the
greeks
kk
for
example
by
persuading
it
that
supporting
the
armenian
kk
resolution
which
came
before
the
senate
in
february
kk
could
help
sour
turcoisraeli
relations
in
addition
the
kk
israeli
embassy
in
washington
was
active
in
ensuring
that
the
kk
resolution
failed
for
instance
by
assisting
turkish
jews
to
kk
travel
to
wahington
to
underline
the
affinity
between
israel
kk
and
turkey
kk
kk
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
debt
which
turkey
felt
it
owed
kk
to
israel
over
this
matter
even
four
months
before
the
re
kk
solution
came
up
for
consideration
as
enior
member
of
the
kk
turkish
foreign
ministry
said
his
country
was
very
grateful
kk
to
israel
the
cooperation
in
his
view
refelecting
the
kk
maturity
of
the
bilateral
relationship
the
experience
over
kk
the
armenian
issue
has
convinced
senior
figures
in
turkey
kk
that
the
proisrael
network
in
washington
can
indeed
deliver

the
desired

you
have
a
rather
warped
sense
of
logic
you
are
telling
us
that
because
israel
wishes
to
have
good
relations
with
turkey
even
at
the
expense
of
armenians
or
armenia
makes
it
bad
for
turks
to
tell
racist
jokes
against
jews
thus
we
can
infer
if
israel
had
poor
relations
with
turkey
it
would
be
alright
to
post
such
horrible
jokes
against
