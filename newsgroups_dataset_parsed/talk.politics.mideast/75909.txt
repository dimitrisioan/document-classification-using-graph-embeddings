PR
CAMPAIGN
AGAINST
IRAN
PBS
FRONTLINE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
A
NUMBER
OF
ARTICLES
ON
THE
PBS
FRONTLINE
PROGRAM
ABOUT
IRANIAN
BOMB
HERE
IS
MY
ON
THIS
AND
RELATED
SUBJECTS
ONE
IS
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
THE
REAL
REASONS
BEHIND
THIS
AND
RELATED
PUBLIC
RELATIONS
CAMPAIGN
ABOUT
IRAN
IN
RECENT
MONTHS
THESE
INCLUDE
ATTEMPTS
TO
IMPLICATE
IRAN
IN
THE
BOMBING
OF
THE
NEW
YORK
TRADE
CENTER
DESPITE
GREAT
EFFORTS
IN
THIS
DIRECTION
THEY
HAVE
NOT
SUCCEEDED
IN
THIS
THEY
HOWEVER
HAVE
INDIRECTLY
CREATED
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
IRAN
IS
BEHIND
THE
RISE
OF
FUNDAMENTALIST
ISLAMIC
MOVEMENTS
AND
THUS
ARE
INDIRECTLY
IMPLICATED
IN
THIS
MATTER
PUBLIC
STATEMENTS
BY
THE
SECRETARY
OF
STATE
CHRISTOFFER
AND
OTHER
OFFICIAL
SOURCES
REGARDING
IRAN
BEING
A
TERRORIST
AND
OUTLAW
STATE
AND
FINALLY
THE
RECENT
BROADCAST
OF
THE
FRONTLINE
PROGRAM
I
SUSPECT
THAT
THIS
PR
CAMPAIGN
AGAINST
IRAN
WILL
CONTINUE
AND
PERHAPS
INTENSIFY
WHY
THIS
INCREASED
PRESSURE
ON
IRAN
A
NUMBER
OF
FACTORS
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
BEHIND
THIS
THESE
INCLUDE
THE
RISE
OF
ISLAMIC
MOVEMENTS
IN
NORTHAFRICA
AND
RADICAL
HAMAS
MOVEMENT
IN
THE
ISRAELI
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
THIS
MOVEMENT
IS
BASICALLY
ANTIWESTERN
AND
IS
NOT
NECESSARILY
FUELED
BY
IRAN
THE
CAUSE
FOR
ACCELERATED
PACE
OF
THIS
MOVEMENT
IS
PROBABLY
THE
GULF
WAR
WHICH
SOUGHT
TO
RETURN
COLONIAL
SHIEKS
AND
AMIRS
TO
THEIR
THRONE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
DEMOCRACY
AND
FREEDOM
ALSO
THE
OBVIOUS
SUPPORT
OF
ALGERIAN
MILITARY
COUP
AGAINST
THE
DEMOCRATICALLY
ELECTED
ALGERIAN
ISLAMIC
FRONT
WHICH
CLEARLY
EXPOSED
THE
DEMOCRACY
MYTH
A
FURTHER
CAUSE
OF
THIS
MAY
BE
THE
DAILY
BROADCAST
OF
THE
NEWS
ON
THE
SLAUGHTER
OF
BOSNIAN
MOSLEMS
POSSIBLE
FUTURE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THIS
MOVEMENT
IN
SAUDI
ARABIA
AND
OTHER
US
CLIENT
STATES
AND
ENDANGERMENT
OF
THE
CHEAP
OIL
SOURCES
FROM
THIS
REGION
A
NEED
TO
CREATE
AN
ENEMY
AS
AN
EXCUSE
FOR
HUGE
DEFENSE
EXPENDITURES
THIS
HAS
BECOME
NECESSARY
AFTER
THE
DEMISE
OF
SOVEIT
UNION
THE
RECENT
PR
CAMPAIGN
AGAINST
IRAN
HOWEVER
SEEMS
TO
BE
DIRECTED
FROM
ISRAEL
RATHER
THAN
WASHINGTON
THERE
IS
NO
FUNDAMENTAL
CONFLICT
OF
INTEREST
BETWEEN
IRAN
AND
THE
US
AND
IN
MY
OPINION
IT
IS
IN
THE
INTEREST
OF
BOTH
COUNTRIES
TO
AFFECT
REESTABLISHMENT
OF
NORMAL
AND
FRIENDLY
RELATIONS
THIS
MAY
HAVE
A
MODERATING
EFFECT
ON
THE
RISE
OF
RADICAL
MOVEMENTS
WITHIN
THE
ISLAMIC
WORLD
AND
IRAN
JAMSHID
