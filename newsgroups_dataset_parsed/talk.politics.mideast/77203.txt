thats
your
opinion
of
course
if
we
were
to
take
your
military
budget
definition
of
foreign
aid
then
the
foreign
aid
we
send
annually
to
israel
is
easily
multiplied
beyond
the
three
to
six
depending
on
whose
figures
you
believe
million
of
hardearned
us
taxpayers
dollars
oh
really
lets
see
it
costs
the
us
armed
forces
roughly
in
salaries
for
the
average
man
or
woman
in
uniform
normally
it
takes
times
the
actual
salary
amount
to
support
a
worker
thus
for
the
roughly
soldiers
currently
stationed
in
germany
we
get
nearly
billion
dollars
more
than
the
annual
cost
of
all
aid
to
israel
in
personnel
not
even
counting
what
is
spent
on
local
workers
and
equipment
youre
just
beginning
to
scratch
the
surface
do
you
know
how
much
military
equipment
costs
when
was
the
last
time
you
tried
to
buy
a
milspec
hammer
coffeepot
or
toilet
seat
paying
israel
to
do
the
dirty
work
on
its
own
without
putting
american
soldierss
lives
on
the
line
is
much
much
much
cheaper
than
