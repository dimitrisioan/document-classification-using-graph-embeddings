if
the
haitian
peoples
will
is
that
their
current
govt
get
thrown
out
theyll
find
a
way
to
do
it
getting
the
usun
to
shortcut
the
process
will
only
hasten
it
but
sets
a
bad
precedent
can
the
us
interfere
everywhere
why
not
right
at
our
doorstep
cuba
precisely
why
not
cuba
why
not
the
hatians
are
being
ruled
by
thugs
and
their
elected
leader
has
asked
support
to
reestablish
the
peoples
will
well
lets
delve
one
level
deeper
why
is
democracy
better
than
tribalism
or
other
means
of
govt
the
president
of
georgia
was
elected
with
a
thumping
majority
and
booted
out
later
w
no
objections
from
the
un
similarly
the
people
of
algeria
elected
an
islamic
fundemantalist
party
into
power
but
the
junta
declared
it
illegal
in
both
cases
i
personally
have
no
problems
with
the
outcome
but
if
the
voice
of
the
people
is
that
hallowed
thing
that
the
world
community
claims
to
revere
so
why
isnt
it
interfering
there
the
us
or
any
other
democracy
wishes
to
they
are
in
the
perfect
right
to
help
them
without
any
whining
from
thir
parties
after
all
if
it
turns
out
to
be
colonialism
and
the
poeple
dont
like
it
they
find
a
way
to
throw
them
out
exactly
my
point
is
that
it
will
inevitably
turn
out
that
way
and
we
can
save
ourselves
a
lot
of
pain
and
trouble
by
simply
letting
people
sort
out
their
problems
on
their
own
colonial
interventions
even
in
haiti
havent
worked
in
the
past
they
had
a
coups
from
the
us
invaded
in
and
left
in
almost
years
after
they
had
intended
to
was
it
a
success
well
look
at
haiti
today
and
of
the
past
years
and
decide
for
yourself
it
was
a
success
so
long
as
the
us
was
in
from
what
i
remember
but
it
didnt
last
long
obviously
there
is
an
implicit
assumption
here
that
we
as
outsiders
have
a
right
to
sit
in
judgement
of
another
people
and
to
then
act
on
it
to
me
it
is
in
there
that
the
roots
of
old
colonial
attitudes
lie
today
the
motives
are
noble
tomorrow
they
may
not
be
who
ever
said
people
who
commit
genocide
have
the
right
to
commit
genocide
nobody
did
people
should
have
a
right
to
selfdefense
if
the
un
wants
to
arm
the
bosnians
or
haitian
revolutionaries
or
whoever
i
have
no
problems
with
that
i
do
when
they
cross
that
line
and
attempt
to
rearrange
boundaries
govts
etc
the
vanceowen
plan
being
one
such
piece
of
insanity
i
want
a
world
where
criminals
agains
humanity
have
no
place
to
hide
while
you
want
special
sovereignties
designed
to
protect
them
nobody
has
the
right
to
commit
crimes
against
humanity
and
if
they
do
they
loose
all
right
to
self
determination
if
this
is
classical
colonialism
then
so
be
it
we
finally
have
a
clearlystated
point
of
difference
colonialism
can
have
its
good
side
which
is
as
you
stated
above
removing
thugs
from
being
able
to
lord
it
over
powerless
people
i
am
worried
that
the
bad
side
is
what
will
assert
itself
and
i
am
prepared
to
let
natural
forces
take
their
course
if
that
will
mean
we
can
avoid
the
bad
side
of
colonialism

if
the
university
of
illinois
shares
these
views
id
be
surprised
they
arent
that
smart
generally
