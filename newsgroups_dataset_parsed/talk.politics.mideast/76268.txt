ANDI
BEYER
WRITES
I
HAVE
JUST
STARTED
READING
THE
ARTICLES
IN
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
ATTEMPT
BY
SOME
MEMBERS

QUIET
OTHER
MEMBERS
WITH
SCARE
TACTICS
I
BELIEVE
ONE
POSTING
SAID
THAT
ALL
POSTINGS
BY
ONE
PERSON
ARE
BEING
FORWARDED
TO
HIS
SERVER
WHO
KEEPS
A
FILE
ON
HIM
IN
HOPE
THAT
APPROPRIATE
ACTION
MIGHT
BE
TAKEN
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
YOU

ARE
FROM
BUT
IN
AMERICA
SUCH
ATTEMPTS
TO
CURTAIL
SOMEONES
FIRST
AMENDMENT
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
APPRECIATED
HERE
WE
LET
EVERYONE
SPEAK
THEIR
MIND
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
WE
FEEL
ABOUT
IT
TAKE
YOUR
FASCISTIC
REPRESSIVE
IDEALS
BACK
TO
WHERE
YOU
CAME
FROM
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
OTHERS
ARE
COMPELLED
TO
GIVE
ONE
THE
MEANS
TO
SPEAK
PUBLICLY
SOME
SYSTEMS
HAVE
REGULATIONS
PROHIBITING
THE
DISSEMINATION
OF
RACIST
AND
BIGOTED
MESSAGES
FROM
ACCOUNTS
THEY
ISSUE
APPARENTLY
THATS
NOT
THE
CASE
WITH
