writes
of
course
you
never
read
arab
media
i
dont
though
when
i
was
in
israel
i
did
make
a
point
of
listening
to
jtv
news
as
well
as
monte
carlo
radio
in
the
united
states
i
generally
read
the
nyt
and
occasionally
a
mainstream
israeli
newpaper
i
read
arab
israeli
jer
post
and
this
network
is
more
than
enough
and
western
american
french
and
british
reports
and
i
can
say
that
if
we
give
israel
and
arabs
on
the
bias
scale
of
course
you
can
switch
the
polarities
israeli
newspapers
will
get
either
a
or
american
leading
newspapers
and
tv
news
range
from
to
yes
there
are
some
that
are
more
israelis
than
israelis
the
montreal
suburban
a
local
free
newspaper
probably
is
closer
to
kahanes
views
than
some
israeli
right
wing
newspapers
british
range
from
neutral
to
french
that
iknow
of
of
course
range
from
afrofrench
magazines
to
arab
official
media
range
from
to
egyptian
to
in
sa
why
no
because
they
do
not
want
to
overdo
it
and
stir
people
against
israel
and
therefore
against
them
since
they
are
doing
nothing
what
you
may
not
be
taking
into
account
is
that
the
jp
is
no
longer
representative
of
the
mainstream
in
israel
it
was
purchased
a
few
years
ago
and
in
the
battle
for
control
most
of
the
liberal
and
leftwing
reporters
walked
out
the
new
owner
stated
in
the
past
more
than
once
that
the
jps
task
should
be
geared
towards
explaining
and
promoting
israels
position
more
than
attacking
the
govt
likud
at
the
time
the
paper
that
i
would
recommend
reading
being
middle
stream
and
factual
is
haaretz
or
at
least
this
was
the
case
two
years
ago
the
average
bias
of
what
you
read
would
be
probably
around
while
that
of
the
average
american
would
be
the
same
if
they
do
not
read
or
read
the
newyork
times
and
similar
newsmakers
and
if
they
read
some
other
relatively
less
biased
newspapers
and
what
about
the
natl
enquirer
but
seriously
if
one
were
to
read
some
of
the
leftist
newspapers
one
could
arrive
at
other
conclusions
the
information
you
received
was
highly
selective
and
extrapolating
from
it
is
a
bad
move
