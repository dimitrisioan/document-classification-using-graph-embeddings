BY

THE
FIRST
POINT
TO
NOTE
REGARDING
THE
APPROPRIATION
OF
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
HOLOCAUST
BY
ZIONIST
PROPAGANDA
IS
THAT
ZIONISM
WITHOUT
ANTISEMITISM
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
ZIONISM
AGREES
WITH
THE
BASIC
TENET
OF
ANTISEMITISM
NAMELY
THAT
JEWS
CANNOT
LIVE
WITH
NON
JEWS
THE
HISTORY
AND
ROOTS
OF
THE
HOLOCAUST
GO
BACK
A
LONG
WAY
WHILE
THE
INDUSTRU
OF
DEATH
AND
DESTRUCTION
DID
NOT
OPERATE

PLACED
IN

ASPIRATIONS
FOR

OUT
OF
THE
NATIONAL
STRUGGLES
IN
EUROPE
WHEN
THE
HOPES
FOR

THROUGH

WERE
DASHED
OTHER
ALTERNATIVES
FOR
IMPROVING
THE

OF
THE

OF

THE

A

WITH
ENORMOUS

HAD
TO
CONTEND
WITH
OPPOSITION
FROM
A
NEW
AND
SMALL
ALMOST
INSIGNIFICANT
OPPONENT
THE
POLITICAL
ZIONISTS
IN
OUTLINE
THESE
TWO
OFFERED
DIAMETRICALLY
OPPOSED
OPTIONS
FOR
JEWS
IN
EUROPE
WHILE
THE
BUND
WAS
SUGGESTING
JOINING
FORCES
WITH
THE
REST
OF
EUROPES
WORKERS
THE
ZIONISTS
WERE
PROPOSING
A
NEW
PROGRAMME
AIMED
AT
RIDDING
EUROPE
OF
ITS
JEWS
BY
SETTING
UP
SOME
FORM
OF
A
JEWISH
STATE
HISTORICALLY
NOTHING
IS
INEVITABLE
ALL
DEPENDS
ON
THE
BALANCE
OF

INVOLVED
IN
THE
STRUGGLE
HISTORY
CAN
BE
SEEN
AS
AN
OPTION

EVERY

A
CERTAIN
OPTION
IS
CHOSEN
OTHER
ROUTES
BECOME
BARRED
BECAUSE
OF
THAT
CHOICE
MOVEMENT
BACKWARDS
TO
THE
POINT
BEFORE
THAT
CHOICE
WAS
MADE
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
WHILE
ZIONISM
AS
AN
OPTION
WAS
TAKEN
BY
MANY
YOUNG
JEWS
IT
REMAINED
A
MINORITY
POSITION
UNTIL
THE
FIRST
DAYS
OF
THE
REICH
THE
ZIONIST
FEDERATION
OF
GERMANY
ZVFD
AN
ORGANISATION
REPRESENTING
A
TINY
MINORITY
OF
GERMAN
JEWS
WAS
SELECTED
BY
THE
NAZIS
AS
THE
BODY
TO
REPRESENT
THE
JEWS
OF
THE
REICH
ITS
WAS
THE
ONLY
FLAG
OF
AN
INTERANTIONAL
ORGANISATION
ALLOWED
TO
FLY
IN
BERLIN
AND
THIS
WAS
THE
ONLY
INTERNATIONAL
ORGANISATION
ALLOWED
TO
OPERATE
DURING
THIS
PERIOD
FROM
A
MARGINAL
POSITION
THE
LEADERS
OF
THE
ZIONIST
FEDERATION
WERE
PROPELLED
TO
A
PROMINENCE
AND
CENTRALITY
THAT
SURPRISED
EVEN
THEM
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN
THEY
ATTAINED
POLITICAL
POWER
POWER
BASED
NOT
ON
REPRESENTATION
BUT
FROM
BEING
SELECTED
AS
THE
CHOICE
OF
THE
NAZI
REGIME
FOR
DEALING
WITH
THE
THE
JEWISH
PROBLEM
THEIR
POSITION
IN
NEGOTIATING
WITH
THE
NAZIS
AGREEMENTS
THAT
AFFECTED
THE
LIVES
OF
MANY
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
THE
JEWS
IN
GERMANY
TRANSFORMED
THEM
FROM
A
UTOPIAN
MARGINAL
ORGANISATION
IN
GERMANY
AND
SOME
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
EUROPE
INTO
A
REAL
OPTION
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
BY
GERMAN
JEWS
THE
BEST
EXAMPLE
OF
THIS
WAS
THE
TRANSFER
AGREEMENT
OF
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THE
NAZI
TAKEOVER
IN
JEWS
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD
SUPPORTED
OR
WERE
ORGANISING
A
WORLD
WIDE
BOYCOTT
OF
GERMAN
GOODS
THIS
CAMPAIGN
HURT
THE
NAZI
REGIME
AND
THE
GERMAN
AUTHORITIES
SEARCHED
FRANTICALLY
FOR
A
WAY
DISABLING
THE
BOYCOTT
IT
WAS
CLEAR
THAT
IF
JEWS
AND
JEWISH
ORGANISATIONS
WERE
TO
PULL
OUT
THE
CAMPAIGN
WOULD
COLLAPSE
THIS
PROBLEM
WAS
SOLVED
BY
THE
ZVFD
A
LETTER
SENT
TO
THE
NAZI
PARTY
AS
EARLY
AS
JUNE
OUTLINED
THE
DEGREE
OF
AGREEMENT
THAT
EXISTED
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
ORGANISATIONS
ON
THE
QUESTION
OF
RACE
NATION
AND
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
JEWISH
PROBLEM
AND
IT
OFFERED
TO
COLLABORATE
WITH
THE
NEW
REGIME
THE
REALISATION
OF
ZIONISM
COULD
ONLY
BE
HURT
BY
RESENTMENT
OF
JEWS
ABROAD
AGAINST
THE
GERMAN
DEVELOPMENT
BOYCOTT
PROPAGANDA
SUCH
AS
IS
CURRENTLY
BEING
CARRIED
OUT
AGAINST
GERMANY
IN
MANY
WAYS
IS
IN
ESSENCE
UNZIONIST
BECAUSE
ZIONISM
WANTS
NOT
TO
DO
BATTLE
BUT
TO
CONVINCE
AND
BUILD
IN
THEIR
EAGERNESS
TO
GAIN
CREDENCE
AND
THE
BACKING
OF
THE
NEW
REGIME
THE
ZIONIST
ORGANISATION
MANAGED
TO
UNDERMINE
THE
BOYCOTT
THE
MAIN
PUBLIC
ACT
WAS
THE
SIGNATURE
OF
THE
TRANSFER
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
NAZI
AUTHORITIES
DURING
THE
ZIONIST
CONGRESS
OF
IN
ESSENCE
THE
AGREEMENT
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
GET
GERMANYS
JEWS
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
AND
INTO
MANDATE
PALESTINE
IT
PROVIDED
A
POSSIBILITY
FOR
JEWS
TO
TAKE
A
SIZEABLE
PART
OF
THEIR
PROPERTY
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
THROUGH
A
TRANSFER
OF
GERMAN
GOODS
TO
PALESTINE
THIS
RIGHT
WAS
DENIED
TO
JEWS
LEAVING
TO
ANY
OTHER
DESTINATION
THE
ZIONIST
ORGANISATION
WAS
THE
ACTING
AGENT
THROUGH
ITS
FINANCIAL
ORGANISATIONS
THIS
AGREEMENT
OPERATED
ON
A
NUMBER
OF
FRONTS
HELPING
JEWS
TO
LEAVE
THE
COUNTRY
BREAKING
THE
RING
OF
THE
BOYCOTT
EXPORTING
GERMAN
GOODS
IN
LARGE
QUANTITIES
TO
PALESTINE
AND
LAST
BUT
NOT
LEAST
ENABLING
THE
REGIME
TO
BE
SEEN
AS
HUMANE
AND
REASONABLE
EVEN
TOWARDS
ITS
AVOWED
ENEMIES
THE
JEWS
AFTER
ALL
THEY
ARGUED
THE
JEWS
DO
NOT
BELONG
IN
EUROPE
AND
NOW
THE
JEWS
COME
AND
AGREE
WITH
THEM
AFTER
NEWS
OF
THE
AGREEMENT
BROKE
THE
BOYCOTT
WAS
DOOMED
IF
THE
ZIONIST
ORGANIZATION
FOUND
IT
POSSIBLE
AND
NECESSARY
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
NAZIS
AND
IMPORT
THEIR
GOODS
WHO
COULD
ARGUE
FOR
A
BOYCOTT
THIS
WAS
NOT
THE
FIRST
TIME
THAT
THE
INTERESTS
OF
BOTH
MOVEMENTS
WERE
PRESENTED
TO
THE

BARON

HE

A

OF

IN

DESCRIBING
THE

A
JEW

ESTABLISHED
QUITE
CLEARLY
THE
RELATIONSHIP
DURING
THE
EARLY
DAYS
OF

BETWEEN
THE

AND

A
RELATIONSHIP
THAT
WAS
ECHOED
LATER
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
KEY
INSTANCES
EVEN
AFTER
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
FINAL
SOLUTION
BECAME
CLEAR
IN

CASES
THIS

OF

A

IT
OCCURED
NEAR
THE

OF

THE

HAD
ADVANCED
ALMOST
UP
TO
GERMANY
ITALY
AND
THE

THE

WERE
ON
THE
RUN
WITH
A
NUMBER
OF

COUNTRIES
SUCH
AS

LEAVING

A

WAS
A
MATTER
OF
MONTHS
AWAY
AS
THE
WESTERN
ALLIES
PREPARED
THEIR
FORCES
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
ALL
THIS
WE
FIND
EICHMANN
THE
MASTER
BUREAUCRAT
OF
INDUSTRIAL
MURDER
SETTING
UP
HIS
HZ
IN
OCCUPIED
BUDAPEST
AFTER
THE
GERMAN
TAKEOVER
OF
THE
COUNTRY
IN
APRIL
HIS
FIRST
ACT
WAS
TO
HAVE
A
CONFERENCE
WITH
THE
JEWISH
LEADERSHIP
AND
TO
APPOINT
ZIONIST
FEDERATION
MEMBERS
HEADED
BY
KASTNER
AS
THE
AGENT
AND
CLEARING
HOUSE
FOR
ALL
JEWS
AND
THEIR
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
THE
SS
AND
THE
NAZR
AUTHORITIES
WHY
THEY
DID
THIS
IS
NOT
DIFFICULT
TO
SEE
AS
OPPOSED
TO
POLAND
WHERE
ITS
THREE
AND
A
HALF
MILLION
JEWS
LIVED
IN
GHETTOES
AND
WERE
VISIBLY
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
POLISH
POPULATION
THE
HUNGARIAN
JEWS
WERE
AN
INTEGRATED
PART
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
THE
MIDDLE
CLASS
WAS
MAINLY
JEWISH
THE
JEWS
WERE
MAINLY
MIDDLECLASS
THEY
ENJOYED
FREEDOM
OF
TRAVEL
SERVED
IN
THE
HUNGARIAN
FASCIST
ARMY
IN
FRONLINE
UNITS
AS
OFFICERS
AND
SOLDIERS
THEIR
NAMES
WERE
HUNGARIAN
HOW
WAS
EICHMANN
TO
FIND
THEM
IF
THEY
WERE
TO
BE
EXTERMINATED
THE
TASK
WAS
NOT
EASY
THERE
WERE
A
MILLION
JEWS
IN
HUNGARY
MOST
OF
THEM
RESIDENT
THE
REST
BEING
REFUGEES
FROM
OTHER
COUNTRIES
MANY
HAD
HEARD
ABOUT
THE
FATE
OF
JEWS
ELSEWHERE
AND
WERE
UNLIKELY
TO
BELIEVE
ANY
STATEMENTS
BY
NAZI
OFFICIALS
LIKE
ELSEWHERE
THE
ONLY
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
THE
INFORMATION
AND
THE
EAR
OF
THE
FRIGHTENED
JEWISH
POPULATION
WERE
THE
JUDENRAT
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
JUDENRAT
COMPRSIED
MAINLY
THE
ZIONIST
FEDERATION
MEMBERS
WITHOUT
THEIR
HELP
THE
SS
WITH
OFFICERS
AND
LESS
THAN
MEN
PLUS
A
FEW
HUNDRED
HUNGARIAN
POLICE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
COLLECTED
AND
CONTROLLED
A
MILLION
JEWS
WHEN
THEY
DID
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
THEIR
WHEREABOUTS
KASTNER
AND
THE
OTHERS
WERE
LEFT
UNDER
NO
ILLUSIONS
EICHMANN
TOLD
JOEL
BRAND
ONE
OF
THE
MEMBERS
OF
KASTNERS
COMMITTEE
THAT
HE
INTENDED
TO
SEND
ALL
HUNGARYS
JEWS
TO
AUSCHWITZ
BEFORE
HE
EVEN
STARTED
THE
EXPULSIONS
HE
TOLD
THEM
CLEARLY
THAT
ALL
THESE
JEWS
WILL
DIE
A
DAY
UNLESS
CERTAIN
CONDITIONS
WERE
MET
THE
COMMITTEE
FACED
A
SIMPLE
CHOICE
TO
TELL
THE
JEWS
OF
HUNGARY
ABOUT
THEIR
FATE
WITH
NEUTRAL
RUMANIA
WHERE
MANY
COULD
ESCAPE
BEING
IN
MOST
CASES
A
FEW
HOURS
AWAY
OR
TO
COLLABORATE
WITH
THE
NAZIS
BY
ASSISTING
IN
THE
CONCENTRATION
PROCESS
WHAT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
BELIEVED
WHEN
COMING
FROM
THE
SS
SOUNDED
QUITE
PLAUSIBLE
WHEN
COMING
FROM
THE
MOUTHS
OF
THE
ZIONIST
LEADERSHIP
THUS
IT
IS
THAT
MOST
OF
THE
HUNGARIAN
JEWS
WENT
QUIETLY
TO
THEIR
DEATH
ASSURED
BY
THEIR
LEADERSHIP
THAT
THEY
WERE
TO
BE
SENT
TO
WORK
CAMPS
TO
BE
SURE
THERE
ARE
THIRTY
PIECES
OF
SILVER
IN
THIS
NARRATIVE
OF
DESTRUCTION
THE
TRAINS
OF
PROMINENTS
WHICH
EICHMANN
PROMISED
TO
KASTNER
A
PROMISE
HE
KEPT
TO
THE
LAST
DETAIL
FOR
EICHMANN
IT
WAS
A
BARGAIN
ALLOWING
JEWS
TO
SURVIVE
AS
THE
PRICE
PAID
FOR
THE
SILENT
COLLABORATION
OVER
THE
DEATH
OF
ALMOST
A
MILLION
JEWS
THERE
WAS
NO
WAY
IN
WHICH
THE
JEWS
OF
HUNGARY
COULD
EVEN
BE
LOCATED
NOT
TO
SAY
MURDERED
WITHOUT
THE
FULL
COLLABORATION
OF
KASTNER
AND
HIS
FEW
FRIENDS
NO
DOUBT
THE
SS
WOULD
HUNT
A
FEW
JEWS
HERE
AND
THERE
BUT
THE
SCALE
OF
THE
OPERATION
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MINISCULE
COMPARED
TO
THE
HALF
MILLION
WHO
DIED
IN
AUSCHWITZ
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
REALISE
THAT
KASTNER
WAS
NOT
AN
ABERRATION
LIKE
SAY
RUMKOVSKY
IN
LODZ
KASTNER
ACTED
AS
A
RESULT
OF
HIS
STRONGLY
HELD
ZIONIST
CONVICTIONS
HIS
ACTIONS
WERE
A
LOGICAL
OUTCOME
OF
EARLIER
POSITIONS
THIS
IS
INSTANCED
WHEN
HE
EXPOSED
TO
THE
GESTAPO
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
BRITISH
CELL
OF
SABOTEURS
PALGI
AND
SENESH
AND
PERSUADED
THEM
TO
GIVE
THEMSELVES
UP
SO
AS
NOT
TO
DISRUPT
HIS
OPERATIONS
AT
NO
POINT
DURING
HIS
TRIAL
OR
ELSEWHERE
DID
KASTNER
DENY
THAT
HE
KNEW
EXACTLY
WHAT
WAS
TO
HAPPEN
TO
THOSE
JEWS
TO
CONCLUDE
THE
ROLE
PLAYED
BY
ZIONISTS
IN
THIS
PERIOD
WAS
CONNECTED
TO
ANOTHER
ROLE
THEY
COULD
AND
SHOULD
HAVE
PLAYED
THAT
OF
ALARMING
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
TO
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
IN
EUROPE
THEY
HAD
THE
INFORMATION
BUT
POLITICALLY
IT
WAS
CONTRARY
TO
THEIR
PRIORITIES
THE
PRIORITIES
WERE
AND
STILL
ARE
QUITE
SIMPLE
ALL
THAT
FURTHERS
THE
ZIONIST
ENTERPRISE
IN
PALESTINE
IS
FOLLOWED
WHATEVER
THE
PRICE
THE
LIVES
OF
INDIVIDUALS
JEWS
AND
NONJEWS
ARE
SECONDARY
IF
THIS
PROCESS
REQUIRES
DEALING
WITH
FASCISTS

AND
OTHER
ASSORTED
DICTATORIAL
REGIMES
ACROSS

SO
BE
IT
