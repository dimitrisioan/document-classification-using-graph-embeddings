RE
WASGO
HEZBOLLAH
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
IT
IS
NOT
A
TERRORIST
CAMP
AS
YOU
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
LIKE
TO
VIEW
THE
VILLAGES
THEY
ARE
SMALL
COMMUNITIES
WITH
KIDS
PLAYING
SOCCER
IN
THE
STREETS
WOMEN
PREPARING
LUNCH
MEN
PLAYING
CARDS
ETC
SOME
YOUNG
MEN
USUALLY
AGED
BETWEEN
TO
YEARS
ARE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
EVEN
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
VILLAGE
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHO
THESE
ARE
THEY
ARE
SECRETIVE
ABOUT
IT
BUT
MOST
PEOPLE
OFTEN
SUSPECT
WHO
THEY
ARE
AND
WHAT
THEY
ARE
UP
TO
THESE
YOUNG
MEN
ARE
SUPPORTED
FINANCIALLY
BY
IRAN
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THEY
SNEAK
ARMS
AND
AMMUNITIONS
INTO
THE
OCCUPIED
ZONE
WHERE
THEY
SET
UP
BOOBY
TRAPS
FOR
ISRAELI
PATROLS
EVERY
TIME
AN
ISRAELI
SOLDIER
IS
KILLED
OR
INJURED
BY
THESE
TRAPS
ISRAEL
RETALLIATES
BY
INDISCRIMINATELY
BOMBING
VILLAGES
OF
THEIR
OWN
CHOOSING
OFTEN
KILLING
ONLY
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
THIS
A
TRIED
AND
TRUE
METHOD
UTILIZED
BY
GUERILLA
AND
TERRORISTS
GROUPS
TO
CONDUCT
OPERATIONS
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
LOCAL
POPULACE
THUS
FORCING
THE
OPPOSING
STATE
TO
POSSIBLE
HARM
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
IN
THEIR
SEARCH
OR
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
THE
DEATHS
OF
CIVILIANS
ABANDON
THE
SEARCH
CERTAINLY
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ARE
ALSO
TO
BLAIM
FOR
DRAGGING
THE
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
INTO
HARMS
WAY
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
WHEN
GUERILLAS
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ISRAEL
SHOULD
TOTALLY
BACK
DOWN
SOTHE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
ATTACKING
ANOTHER
IS
TO
USE
AN
INNOCENT
AS
A
SHIELD
AND
HOPE
THAT
THE
OTHER
RESPECTS
INNOCENT
LIVES
IF
ISRAEL
INSISTS
THAT
THE
SO
CALLED
SECURITY
ZONE
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
PROTECTION
OF
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
THAN
IT
WILL
HAVE
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
OF
ITS
OCCUPATION
WITH
THE
BLOOD
OF
ITS
SOLDIERS
YOUR
DAMN
RIGHT
ISRAEL
INSISTS
ON
SOME
SORT
OF
DEMILITARIZED
OR
BUFFER
ZONE
ITS
HAD
TO
PUT
UP
WITH
TOO
MANY
YEARS
OF
ATTACKS
FROM
THE
TERRITORY
OF
ARAB
STATES
AND
WATCHED
AS
THE
STATES
DID
NOTHING
IT
IS
NOT
EXACTLY
SURPRIZING
THAT
ISRAEL
DECIDED
THAT
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
STOP
SUCH
ACTIONS
IS
TO
DO
IT
THEMSELVES
IF
ISRAEL
IS
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
THAN
IT
SHOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
OUR
LAND
WHAT
SO
THE
WHOLE
BIT
ABOUT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
NEIGHBORING
ARAB
STATES
CAN
START
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
WHILE
I
ALSO
HOPE
FOR
THIS
TO
HAPPEN
IT
WILL
ONLY
OCCUR
WHEN
ARAB
STATES
SHOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
PREPARED
TO
TAKE
ON
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
THE
DUTY
TO
STOP
GUERILLA
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
THEIR
SOIL
THEY
HAVE
TO
PROVE
IT
OR
PROVIDE
SOME
GUARATEES
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
ISRAEL
IS
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
THEIR
WORD
NOT
WITH
THEIR
PAST
ATTITUDE
OF
TOLERANCE
TOWARDS
ANTIISRAEL
GUERILLAS
INRESIDENCE
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
BEFORE
ON
THIS
VERY
NEWSGROUP
THAT
THE
ONLY
REAL
SOLUTION
WILL
COME
AS
A
RESULT
OF
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PEACE
SETTLEMENT
WHEREBY
ISRAEL
WITHDRAWS
TO
ITS
OWN
BORDERS
AND
PEACE
KEEPING
TROOPS
ARE
STATIONED
ALONG
THE
BORDER
TO
INSURE
NO
ONE
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
BORDER
IS
SHELLED
GOOD
LORD
BRAD
WHAT
IN
THE
WORLD
GOVES
YOU
THE
IDEA
THAT
UN
TROOPS
STOP
ANYTHING
THEY
ARE
ONLY
STATIONED
IN
A
COUNTRY
BECAUSE
THAT
COUNTRY
ALLOWS
THEM
IN
IT
CAN
ASK
THEM
TO
LEAVE
AT
ANY
TIME
AS
NASSER
DID
IN
AND
SOMEHOW
WITH
THAT
LIMITATION
ON
THE
TROOPS
POWERS
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
ISRAEL
IS
GOING
TO
BE
ANY
MORE
COMFORTABLE
WITHOUT
A
GENUINE
COMMITMENT
TO
PEACE
FROM
THE
ARAB
STATES
AND
CONCRETE
NOT
INTELLECTUAL
OR
POLITICAL
EXERCISES
IN
JARGON
GUARANTEES
BY
OTHER
PARTIES
THE
UN
IS
WORTHLESS
TO
ISRAEL
BUT
PERHAPS
USEFUL
AS
A
RUSE
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
REALISTIC
SOLUTION
IT
IS
TIME
FOR
ISRAEL
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
BUFFER
ZONE
AIMED
AT
PROTECTING
ITS
NORTHERN
CITIES
HAS
FAILED
IN
FACT
IT
HAS
CAUSED
MUCH
MORE
ISRAELI
DEATHS
THAN
THE
OCCASIONAL
SHELLING
OF
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
WOULD
HAVE
RESULTED
IN
PERHAPS
YOU
ARE
AWARE
THAT
TO
MOST
COMMUNITIES
OF
PEOPLE
THERE
IS
THE
FEELING
THAT
IT
IS
BETTER
THAT
MANY
OF
US
DIE
FIGHTING
AGAINST
THOSE
WHO
ATTACK
US
THAN
FOR
FEW
TO
DIE
WHILE
WE
SILENTLY
ACCEPT
OUR
FATE
IFHOWEVER
YOU
CALL
ON
ISRAEL
TO
SEE
THE
SENSE
OF
SUFFERING
FEWER
CASUALTIES
I
SUGGEST
YOU
APPLY
THE
SAME
TO
PALESTINIAN
ARAB
AND
ISLAMIC
GROUPS
IF
ISRAEL
REALLY
WANTS
TO
SAVE
SOME
ISRAELI
LIVES
IT
WOULD
WITHDRAW
UNILATERALLY
FROM
THE
SOCALLED
SECURITY
ZONE
BEFORE
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
THE
PEACE
TALKS
SUCH
A
MOVE
WOULD
SAVE
ISRAELI
LIVES
ADVANCE
PEACE
EFFORTS
GIVE
ISRAEL
A
GREAT
MORAL
LIFT
BETTER
ISRAELS
PUBLIC
IMAGE
ABROAD
AND
GIVE
IT
AN
EDGE
IN
THE
PEACE
NEGOCIATIONS
SINCE
ISRAEL
CAN
RIGHTLY
CLAIM
THAT
IT
IS
GENUINELY
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
AND
HAS
ALREADY
OFFERED
SOME
IMPORTANT
CONCESSIONS
ALONG
WITH
SUCH
A
WITHDRAWAL
ISRAEL
COULD
DEMAND
THAT
HIZBOLLAH
BE
DISARMED
BY
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
AND
WARN
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
ACCEPT
ANY
ATTACKS
AGAINST
ITS
NORTHERN
CITIES
AND
THAT
IF
SUCH
A
SHELLING
OCCURS
THAN
IT
WILL
CONSIDER
RETAKING
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
AND
WILL
HOLD
THE
LEBANESE
AND
SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
FROM
ISRAELS
PERSPECTIVE
CONCESSIONS
GETS
IT
NOTHINGEXCEPT
THE
REALIZATION
THAT
IT
HAS
GIVEN
SOMETHING
UP
AND
NOW
CAN
ONLY
HOPE
THAT
THE
OTHER
SIDE
DECIDES
TO
DO
LIKEWISE
WORDS
CAN
BE
TAKEN
BACK
BY
MERELY
DOING
SO
TO
TAKE
BACK
TANGIBLE
ITEMS
LAND
CONTROL
OF
LAND
REQUIRES
THE
SORT
OF
ACTION
YOU
SAY
ISRAEL
SHOULD
STAY
AWAY
FROM
ISRAEL
PUT
UP
WITH
ATTACKS
FROM
ARAB
STATE
TERRITORIES
FOR
DECADES
BEFORE
ESSENTIALLY
PUTTING
A
STOP
TO
IT
THROUGH
ITS
INVASION
OF
LEBANON
THE
ENTIRE
BASIS
OF
THAT
REALITY
WAS
EXACTLY
AS
YOU
STATE
ABOVE
ISRAEL
WOULD
EXPRESS
OUTRAGE
AT
THESE
ATTACKS
AND
PROTEST
TO
THE
ARAB
STATE
INVOLVED
THAT
STATE
PROMPTLY
IGNORED
THE
ENTIRE
MATTER
SECURE
IN
THE
KNOWLEDGE
THAT
IT
COULD
NOT
BE
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
ACTS
COMMITTED
BY
PRIVATE
GROUPS
ISRAEL
WOULD
PREPARE
FOR
THE
NEXT
ROUND
OF
ATTACKS
WHAT
WOULD
ISRAEL
WANT
TO
RETURN
TO
THOSE
DAYS
AND
DONT
BE
SO
IDIOTIC
AS
TO
SUGGEST
TRUST
FOR
THE
MOTIVATIONS
OF
PRESENTDAY
ARAB
STATES
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
VERY
LITTLE
INCENTIVE
FOR
THE
SYRIAN
AND
LEBANESE
GOOVERNMENT
TO
ALLOW
HIZBOLLAH
TO
BOMB
ISRAEL
PROPER
UNDER
SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES
AH
OKWHAT
IS
DIFFERENT
ABOUT
THE
PRESENT
SITUATION
THAT
TELLS
US
THAT
THE
ARAB
STATES
WILL
NOT
PURSUE
THEIR
PAST
ANTAGONISTIC
POLICIES
TOWARDS
ISRAEL
NOW
DONT
TALK
ABOUT
VAGUE
POLITICAL
FACTORS
BUT
ABOUT
THOSE
TANGIBLE
JUST
LIKE
THAT
WHICH
ISRAEL
GAVE
UP
FACTORS
THAT
GUARANTEE
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
THOSE
STATES
YOUR
ASSESSMENT
OF
DIFFERENCE
HERE
IS
BASED
ON
A
WHOLE
LOT
OF
ASSUMPTIONS
AND
MOST
STATES
DONT
FEEL
CONFORTABLE
BASING
THEIR
EXISTENCE
ON
THAT
SORT
OF
THING
AND
NOW
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
PROVEN
THAT
IT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
CONTROLLING
AND
DISARMING
ALL
MILITIAS
AS
THEY
DID
IN
ALL
OTHER
PARTS
OF
LEBANON
BASIL
IT
HAS
NOT
WITHOUT
THE
SUPPORT
AND
ACTIVE
INVOLVEMENT
OF
SYRIA
LEBANON
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ACCOMPLISH
ALL
THAT
HAS
OCCURRED
ONCE
SYRIA
LEAVES
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
LEBANON
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
RETAIN
CONTROL
IF
SYRIA
STAYS
THAY
MAY
BE
EVEN
MORE
DANGEROUS
FOR
ISRAEL
TIM
YOUR
VIEW
OF
THIS
ENTIRE
MATTER
IS
FAR
TOO
SERENELY
ONESIDED
AND
SELECTIVELY
NAIVE
