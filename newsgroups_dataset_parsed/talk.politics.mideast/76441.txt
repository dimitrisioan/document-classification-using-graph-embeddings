is
this
means
that
the
number
of
the
people
have
been
killed
by
israel
are
so
high
that
you
can
not
keep
the
track
of
or
this
is
also
a
part
of
zionism
ideology
that
you
dont
need
to
keep
the
track
of
the
people
you
kill
just
kill
if
you
know
that
the
number
is
so
high
would
you
care
to
provide
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
hamid
most
of
those
killed
by
the
israeli
army
were
agressors
who
were
invading
or
attacking
israel
with
the
intention
of
murdering
jews
and
destroying
the
jewish
state
thus
i
have
no
sympathy
for
them
and
i
really
dont
give
a
damn
about
how
many
were
killed
