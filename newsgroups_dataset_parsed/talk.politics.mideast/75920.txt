TRANSLATION
AS
A

MOST
OF
THE
TRANSLATION
ELIDED
THE
LOVE
OF
THE
FATHERLAND
IS
THE
STRONGEST
OF

I
THINK
THIS
PART
OF
THE
TRANSLATION
IS
QUESTIONABLE
ALTHOUGH
I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
QUOTE
IS
PLAIN
SILLY
YOU
MADE
IT
SOUND
AS
IF
IT
IS
COMING
FROM
A
NEONAZI
YOUTH
FOR
EXAMPLE
TURKS
TALK
OF
A
MOTHERLAND
NOT
A
GERMANIC
FATHERLAND
WHY
FILTH
INSTEAD
OF
DIRT
THE
INDETERMINACY
OF
TRANSLATION
IS
A
WELLKNOWN
PROBLEM
SO
ONE
MAY
HAVE
TO
FUDGE
BUT
WITH
SOME
CARE
OF
COURSE
IS
THE
FOLLOWING
AN
EQUALLY
VALID
TRANSLATION
THE
LOVE
OF
ONES
COUNTRY
IS
THE
STRONGEST
WIND
TO
CLEANSE
ONES
SOUL
