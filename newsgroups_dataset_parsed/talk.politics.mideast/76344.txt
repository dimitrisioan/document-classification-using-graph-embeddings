QUESTIONS

ISRAELIS
IN

CPRIGCAPCORG
CENTER

SAYS
YOUR
ANSWER
TO
THE
QUESTION
CONCERNING
RIGHTS
TO
RETURN
CONFLICTS
WITH
WHAT
I
WAS
TOLD
NAMELY
THAT
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
NONJEWS
WHO
LEFT
FOR
SOME
REASON
OR
OTHER
THE
AREA
UNDER
ISRAEL
CONTROL
DURING
THE
WAR
OF
WERE
PREVENTED
FROM
RETURNING
FOR
THE
SOLE
REASON
THEY
WERE
NOT
JEWS
JEWS
WHO
ALSO
LEFT
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
EUROPE
TO
AVOID
THE
CLASHES
WERE
ALLOWED
TO
RETURN
HOW
CAN
YOU
JUSTIFY
SUCH
DISCRIMINATION
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
IS
THE
MERE
FACT
OF
A
PERSON
LEAVING
AREA
OF
COMBAT
TO
SEEK
REFUGE
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
A
REASON
FOR
STRIPPING
HIM
OF
HIS
RIGHT
TO
LIVE
IN
HIS
HOMELAND
YOU
ARE
CONVENIENTLY
OMMITTING
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
ARAB
GOVERNMENTS
TOLD
THE
ARAB
CITIZENS
OF
ISRAEL
TO
LEAVE
ISRAEL
JOIN
WITH
THE
ARAB
ARMIES
SO
THAT
AFTER
WHAT
THEY
FELT
LIKE
AN
ASSURED
VICTORY
OCCURED
THESE
ARABS
COULD
RETURN
TO
THEIR
FORMER
HOMES
RECLAIM
THEM
AS
WELL
AS
ANYTHING
ELSE
THEY
WANTED
THAT
BELONGED
TO
JEWS
WHEN
THE
ARABS
LOST
ISRAEL
WAS
LEFT
WITH
A
BUNCH
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
HAS
JUST
TRIED
TO
KILL
THEM
WHO
NOW
WANTED
BACK
INTO
THE
COUNTRY
AS
CITIZENS
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
HAVE
DONE
LET
THEM
IN
SO
THEY
COULD
KILL
JEWS
ISRAEL
SEES
THOSE
ARABS
WHO
STAYED
AS
CITIZENS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
LOYAL
TO
ISRAEL
DURING
THE
WAR
AND
DIDNT
LEAVE
OF
COURSE
SOME
ARABS
COULD
HAVE
LEFT
TO
AVOID
THE
FIGHTING
BUT
DISTINGUISHING
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
THEREFORE
A
DECISION
WAS
MADE
BASED
ON
SECUTURITY
OF
THE
COUNTRY
YOU
MAINTAIN
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
ISRAELI
ARABS
LIVING
IN
ISRAELI
KIBBUTZIM
I
WONDER
HOW
MANY
AND
WHERE
THERE
IS
VERY
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
AVAILABLE
ABOUT
THAT
AS
MUCH
AS
I
KNOW
MANY
ARABS
ARE
WORKING
FOR
KIBBUTZIM
EVEN
FOR
MANY
YEARS
BUT
ARE
NOT
ACCEPTED
AS
MEMBERS
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
KIBBUTZIM
DO
NOT
WANT
ARABS
NO
KIBBUTZ
THAT
I
HAVE
EVER
VISITED
HAS
ANY
EMPLOYEES
UNLESS
THEY
HAD
TO
HIRE
SOME
PEOPLE
FOR
THE
RESTAURANTS
HOTELS
ETC
IF
THERE
WERENT
ENOUGH
PEOPLE
ON
THE
KIBBUTZ
TO
DO
THEM
IN
SUCH
CASES
THEY
ARE
PAID
PROPERLY
IF
A
KIBBUTZ
TURNS
AWAY
AN
ARAB
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
OR
HEARD
OF
THIS
BUT
IT
REFLECTS
ONLY
ON
THE
MEMBERSHIP
COMITTEE
OF
THAT
KIBBUTZ
NOT
THE
WHOLE
KIBBUTZ
MOVEMENT
TO
KEEP
IT
WHAT
WAY
I
AM
CERTAIN
THAT
IF
ONLY
RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITIES
IN
THE
US
WOULD
BE
ASKED
THEY
WOULD
GLADLY
ABOLISH
CIVIL
MARRIAGE
SO
THAT
PEOPLE
WOULD
DEPEND
UPON
RABBIS
AND
PRIESTS
TO
OFFICIATE
MARRIAGES
BUT
ISRAEL
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
RULED
BY
A
SECULAR
MAJORITY
YOUR
ANSWER
IS
NOT
SATISFACTORY
THIS
JUST
SHOWS
HOW
IGNORANT
YOU
ARE
OF
ISRAELI
POLITICS
ALTHOUGH
THE
MAJOR
PARTIES
IN
ISRAEL
ARENT
RELIGIOUS
HOWEVER
NOT
TOTALLY
SECULAR
DUE
TO
THE
FORMAT
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
COALITION
THE
RELIGIOUS
PARTIES
HAVE
ALWAYS
HAD
A
LOT
OF
PULL
SINCE
THEY
WERE
NEEDED
TO
FORM
A
MAJORITY
COALITION
IN
FACT
FROM
WHAT
I
HEARD
THE
PRESENT
GOVERNMENT
IS
THE
LEAST
INFLUENCED
BY
THE
RELIGIOUS
PARTIES
IN
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
ISRAEL
ISRAEL
CANNOT
BE
CALLED
A
SECULAR
STATE
FOR
INSTACE
HAIFA
IS
THE
ONLY
CITY
IN
THE
COUNTRY
EXCEPT
FOR
MAYBE
SOME
ARAB
CITIES
WHERE
BUSES
RUN
ON
THE
JEWISH
SABBATH
THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHER
EXAMPLES
OF
RELIGION
IN
ISRAEL
MARRIAGES
IN
ISRAEL
ARE
NOT
CONTOLLED
BY
THE
STATE
BUT
BY
RABBIS
AND
PRIESTS
OBVIOUSLY
YOUR
DISBELIEF
OF
THIS
FACT
SHEDS
SOME
LIGHT
OF
YOUR
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
COUNTRY
YOU
