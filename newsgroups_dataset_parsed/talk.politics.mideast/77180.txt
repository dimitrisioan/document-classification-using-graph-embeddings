PERLMAN
WRITES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
ZIONISM
AS
IT
IS
IS
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
BY
AS
IT
IS
I
MEAN
NOT
THE
FACT
THAT
IS
NACIONALISM
BUT
THE
SPECIFIC
IDEAS
IT
SUPPORTS
THE
FORM
IT
DEFINES
WHAT
A
JEW
IS
AND
THE
WAY
IT
WANTS
TO
ACCOMPLISH
ITS
GOALS
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
HYPOCRISY
IT
HAS
EVERYTHING
TO
DO
WITH
HYPOCRISY
WEVE
DEALT
WITH
WITH
YOUR
ARGUMENTS
ABOUT
HISTORY
BEFORE
ON
THIS
NET
SUFFICE
IT
TO
SAY
YOU
HAVENT
SUCCEEDED
IN
CONVINCING
ANYONE
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
LACK
OF
BASIS
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
CONVINCE
ANYONE
THIS
IS
JUST
USENET
NOT
THE
REAL
WORLD
I
JUST
READ
THE
OPINIONS
OTHERS
HAVE
ABOUT
A
SUBJECT
AND
SOMETIMES
I
PRESENT
MY
OPINION
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
NET
IS
ONLY
USEFUL
TO
EXCHANGE
IDEAS
I
NEVER
WANTED
NOR
I
WANT
NOW
TO
CONVINCE
ANYONE
OF
ANYTHING
NOW
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
DEAL
WITH
WHAT
CERTAIN
PEOPLE
SAY
THAT
IS
FINE
BUT
BY
CONDEMNING
THE
MOVEMENT
WHICH
IS
NOTHING
MORE
THAN
JEWISH
NATIONALISM
AND
NEVER
HAS
BEEN
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
THAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
QUITE
LITERALLY
THAT
IT
IS
RACIST
TO
THINK
THAT
JEWS
YOUR
OWN
PEOPLE
IT
SHOULD
BE
ADDED
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
A
STATE
IN
THEIR
HOMELAND
THE
SAME
RIGHT
EVERY
OTHER
NATION
HAS
IF
YOU
DONT
AGREE
WITH
THAT
I
SUGGEST
YOU
READ
A
DICTIONARY
BECAUSE
YOUR
INTERPRETATION
IS
JUST
PLAIN
INCONSISTENT
WITH
THAT
DICTIONARY
DEFINITION
AS
WELL
AS
MODERN
HISTORY
FIRST
AND
I
REPEAT
IT
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
THE
IDEA
OF
JEWS
HAVING
THE
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
A
STATE
IS
RACIST
ZIONISM
AS
A
MOVEMENT
IS
MORE
THAN
JUST
THAT
IDEA
I
THINK
THAT
ZIONISM
IN
THE
WAY
IT
DEFINES
WHO
IS
A
JEW
FOR
EXAMPLE
IS
RACISTLIKE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
IRISH
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
NATIONALISM
BUT
I
DO
NOT
SUPPORT
THE
BOMBING
AND
KILLING
OF
THE
IRA
I
BELIEVE
THAT
JEWS
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
NATIONALISM
BUT
I
DO
NOT
SUPPORT
ZIONISM
AS
IT
IS
RIGHT
NOW
HERES
WHERE
YOURE
WRONG
HERES
ALSO
WHERE
YOU
SHOULD
KNOW
YOURE
WRONG
ZIONISM
IS
IN
NO
WAY
MONOLITHIC
NEVER
HAS
BEEN
APPROACHES
TO
ZIONISM
ARE
AS
WIDESPREAD
AS
THE
IDEOLOGIES
OF
HASHOMER
HATZAIR
AND
MEIR
KAHANE
SOME
OF
THOSE
APPROACHES
ARE
RACIST
KAHANE
FOR
ONE
BUT
EVERY
APPROACH
TO
ZIONISM
DEFINES
THOSE
GOALS
DIFFERENTLY
AND
ALSO
DEFINES
A
DIFFERENT
APPROACH
TO
THOSE
GOALS
THE
SINGLE
COMMONALITY
IS
THE
BELIEF
THAT
JEWS
LIKE
EVERY
OTHER
NATION
ON
EARTH
DESERVE
THEIR
OWN
HOMELAND
PERIOD
THAT
IS
WHAT
MAKES
THE
BASIS
FOR
ZIONIST
MOVEMENTS
HOWEVER
I
AM
NOT
CONSIDERING
JUST
THAT
BUT
THE
REST
OF
IT
AS
LONG
AS
ZIONISM
CONSIDERS
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHO
IS
A
JEW
IN
A
JEWISH
STATE
BASED
ON
RELIGION
I
WILL
CONSIDER
ZIONISM
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
AS
YOU
WELL
KNOW
OVER
OF
ISRAELI
JEWS
ARE
SECULAR
IN
OTHER
WORDS
THEY
ARE
IN
NO
WAY
RELIGIOUS
AND
MOST
PROBABLY
DONT
EVEN
BELIEVE
IN
GD
WHICH
MAKES
AN
INTERESTING
POINT
PEOPLE
LIVING
IN
A
JEWISH
STATE
HAVE
SHOWN
THAT
JEWISH
CULTURE
INCLUDES
IN
IT
JEWISH
RELIGION
BUT
THEY
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
SO
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
LIVING
IN
THE
JEWISH
STATE
HAVE
SHOWN
US
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
PROBLEMS
IN
A
STATE
WHERE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
IS
SECULAR
BUT
JUDAISM
IS
DEFINE
ACCORDING
TO
RELIGIOUS
STANDARDS
OR
WHERE
MARRIAGE
IS
A
RELIGIOUS
STAGE
OR
WHERE
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
DEFINES
A
JEW
ACCORDING
TO
A
RELIGIOUS
STANDARD
DID
THOSE
ISRAELIS
WHO
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
AND
WILL
NEVER
DO
BECOME
NONJEWS
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
STILL
DEFINE
THEN
A
JEW
BASED
ON
WHAT
IS
A
RELIGIOUS
DEFINITION
MAYBE
I
WOULD
CONSIDER
HYPOCRISY
TO
SUPPORT
ZIONISM
AND
DISREGARD
THE
RIGHT
TO
SELFDETERMINATION
OF
THE
PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE
AND
THEIR
STRUGGLE
TO
REACH
IT
IF
YOUD
WANTED
TO
SAY
THAT
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
SAID
IT
THEN
I
TOOK
YOU
AT
YOUR
WORD
IN
OTHER
WORDS
I
TOOK
YOUR
WORDS
TO
HAVE
THEIR
NORMAL
DICTIONARY
DEFINITION
IT
IS
NOW
QUITE
OBVIOUS
THAT
YOU
USE
A
DIFFERENT
DICTIONARY
THAN
THE
REST
OF
THE
ENGLISHSPEAKING
WORLD
AND
THAT
YOU
BASE
YOUR
ANALYSIS
ON
MISCONCEPTIONS
ACCORDING

HYPOCRISY
A
FEIGNING
TO
BE
WHAT
ONE
IS
NNOT
OR
TO
BELIEVE
ONE
DOES
NOT
SO
SAYING
THAT
ONE
BELIEVES
IN
ZIONISM
AS
A
SIMPLE
MATTER
OF
PEOPLE
HAVING
THE
RIGHT
TO
NATIONALISM
BUT
DISREGARDING
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE
TO
DO
THE
SAME
ACCORDING
TO
THIS
DICTIONARY
IS
HYPOCRISY
IF
YOU
ARE
REALLY
INTERESTED
ON
WHAT
I
THINK
INSTEAD
OF
DIRECTLY
COMING
WITH
LABELS

HYPOCRAT
SEND
ME
A

WE
CAN

IDEAS
HOW
ABOUT

YOUR

FOR

I

MY

I
DO
STAND
BY

I
SAID
I

IS
A
