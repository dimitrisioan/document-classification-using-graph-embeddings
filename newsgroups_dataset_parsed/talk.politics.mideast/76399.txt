what
hamas
and
islamic
jihad
believe
in
as
far
as
i
can
get
from
the
arab
media
is
an
islamic
state
that
protects
the
rights
of
all
its
inhabitants
under
koranic
law
this
would
be
a
reversal
of
the
situation
in
which
the
jews
in
palestine
took
control
of
the
land
and
its
mostly
muslim
inhabitants
the
borders
of
the
jewish
state
as
drawn
by
the
un
included
the
areas
which
contained
mostly
jews
thats
what
the
surveys
and
the
numerous
commitees
where
after
when
they
visited
here
however
whoever
committed
crimes
against
humanity
torture
blowing
up
their
homes
murders
must
be
treated
and
tried
as
a
war
criminal
the
political
thought
of
these
movements
shows
that
a
freedom
of
choice
will
be
given
to
the
jews
in
living
under
the
new
law
or
leaving
to
the
destintion
of
their
choice
i
never
touched
an
arab
during
my
army
service
and
never
voted
for
anyone
more
right
than
the
green
party
will
i
be
spared
by
these
humanist
standards
or
will
anyone
stop
to
consider
this
before
sloughtering
me
i
doubt
it
and
not
only
because
of
the
past
record
of
murdering
helpless
women
and
children
since
the
turn
of
the
century
up
to
these
days
