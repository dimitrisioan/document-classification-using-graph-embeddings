israels
expansion
ii
tichauervalpsohansede
writes
reporting
the
events
i
doubt
the
propaganda
machine
of
goering
and
later
as
somebody
informed
you
about
your
gross
mistake
you
none
of
you
guys
noticed
my
gross
mistake
cause
you
dont
have
a
clue
i
noticed
the
misspeaking
myself
and
corrected
it
i
doubt
you
would
have
ever
noticed
im
sure
you
learned
the
history
of
nazi
germany
and
austria
from
your
family
actually
ive
read
books
and
taken
courses
on
the
subject
ah
yes
and
like
you
lived
in
the
greater
deutschland
trying
to
make
comparisons
between
israels
politics
and
nazi
german
austrian
politics
shows
only
your
degree
of
ignorance
high
intellect
low
humanity
none
you
guys
are
funny
its
funny
to
see
people
lose
control
and
start
the
name
calling
when
they
realize
they
have
no
point
i
respect
anybody
who
dissagrees
with
me
as
long
as
he
respects
me
and
discusses
in
a
civilized
manner
i
would
never
say
that
anybody
that
critizises
israel
andor
its
politics
is
an
antisemite
could
have
fooled
me
i
dont
know
what
you
call
a
civil
libertarian
never
heard
about
them
but
i
know
only
one
thing
if
all
of
them
think
like
you
do
it
then
civil
libertarians
is
a
new
denomination
for
antisemites
may
other
civil
libertarians
come
to
word
to
this
group
so
that
we
can
learn
if
abeyer
and
me
are
right
that
civil
libertarians
are
antisemites
i
understand
how
individual
liberties
freedom
of
speach
religion
etc
could
be
a
thing
you
never
heard
about
actually
civil
libertarians
believe
in
the
fundamental
freedoms
that
belong
to
human
beings
they
would
support
the
jews
against
the
nazis
or
anyone
else
who
tries
to
oppress
them
and
they
would
support
the
arabs
against
the
israelis
and
any
other
such
oppressive
regimes
iraq
etc
btw
i
couldnt
care
less
for
what
andi
beyer
appreciates
well
actually
now
that
you
mentioned
here
are
a
few
things
i
appreciate
politeness
stimulating
conversation
a
red
rose
new
york
in
june
and
a
good
gerschwinn
tune
a
chocalate
sundae
really
angry
out
of
controll
funny
people
if
you
need
the
complete
list
dont
hesitate
to
ask
