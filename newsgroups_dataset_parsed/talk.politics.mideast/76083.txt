WRITES
IT
IS
VERY
ENCOURAGING
THAT
A
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
TOOK
SO
INTEREST
IN
MY
POSTINGI
RECIEVED
A
COUPLE
OF
LETTERS
TOOSOME
HAS
DEBATED
THE
STATEMENT
THAT
EVENTS
IN
BOSNIA
ARE
UNPRECEDENTED
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
MODERN
WORLDTHOSE
WHO
CONTEST
THIS
STATEMENT
PRESENT
THE
FIGURES
OF
THE
WORLD
WAR
IIHOWEVER
WE
MUST
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
IT
WAS
A
WORLD
WAR
AND
NO
COUNTRY
HAD
THE
POWER
TO
STOP
ITTODAY
IS
THE
MATTER
NOT
OF
THE
POWER
BUT
OF
THE
WILLIT
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
WHAT
WE
LACK
IS
THE
WILL
THE
IDEA
OF
THE
US
OR
ANY
OTHER
NATION
TAKING
ACTION
IE
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
IN
BOSNIA
HAS
NOT
BEEN
WELL
THOUGHT
OUT
BY
THOSE
WHO
ADVOCATE
SUCH
ACTION
AFTER
THE
BELLIGERANTS
ARE
SUBDUED
IT
WOULD
REQUIRE
AN
OCCUPATION
FORCE
FOR
ONE
OR
TWO
GENERATIONS
IF
YOU
WILL
STOP
AND
THINK
ABOUT
IT
YOU
WILL
REALIZE
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
HAVE
NEVER
FORGOTTEN
A
SINGLE
SLIGHT
OR
INJURY
THEY
HAVE
IMBIBED
HATRED
WITH
THEIR
MOTHERS
MILK
IF
WE
STOP
THE
FIGHTING
SEIZE
AND
DESTROY
ALL
WEAPONS
THEY
WILL
SIMPLY
GO
BACK
TO
KILLING
EACH
OTHER
WITH
CLUBS
AND
THE
PRICE
FOR
THIS
FUTILITY
WILL
BE
THE
LIVES
OF
THE
YOUNG
MEN
AND
WOMEN
WE
SEND
THERE
TO
DIE
A
PRICE
I
AM
UNWILLING
TO
EVEN
CONSIDER
SECOND
POINT
OF
DIFFERENCE
WHICH
MAKES
IT
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
HOLOCASTSP
IS
THAT
AT
THAT
TIME
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY
DIDNOT
HAVE
ENOUGH
MUSCLE
TO
PREVENT
THE
UNFORTUNATE
EVENT
THERE
IS
NO
VALID
COMPARISON
TO
THE
HOLOCAUST
ALL
OF
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
THAT
I
HAVE
KNOWN
AS
FRIENDS
WERE
NOT
BROUGHT
UP
TO
HATE
TO
BE
WARY
OF
OTHERS
MOST
CERTAINLY
BUT
NOT
TO
HATE
AND
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
WARSAW
UPRISING
THEY
WERE
UNARMED
AND
EVEN
IN
WARSAW
BADLY
OUTGUNNED
IT
IS
VERY
EASY
TO
SPEAK
OF
MUSCLE
WHEN
THEY
ARE
SOMEONE
ELSES
MUSCLES
SUPPOSE
WE
DO
THIS
THING
WHAT
WILL
YOU
TELL
THE
PARENTS
WIVES
CHILDREN
LOVERS
OF
THOSE
WE
ARE
SENDING
TO
DIE
THAT
THEY
GAVE
THEIR
LIVES
IN
SOME
NOBLE
CAUSE
NOBLE
CAUSE
SEPARATING
SOME
MAD
DOGS
WHO
WILL
TURN
ON
THEM
WELL
I
WILL
OFFER
YOU
SOME
MUSCLE
SUPPOSE
WE
TELL
THEM
THAT
THEY
HAVE
ONE
WEEK
THIS
WILL
GIVE
FOREIGN
NATIONALS
TIME
TO
LEAVE
TO
CEASE
THEIR
BLOODSHED
AT
THE
END
OF
THAT
WEEK
BRING
IN
THE
TOMAHAWK
FIRING
SHIPS
AND
DESTROY
BELGRADE
AS
THEY
DESTROYED
THE
BOSNIAN
CITIES
PERHAPS
WHEN
SOME
OF
THEIR
CITIES
ARE
REDUCED
TO
RUBBLE
THEY
WILL
HAVE
A
SUDDEN
ATTACK
OF
BRAINS
SEND
IN
MISSILES
BY
ALL
MEANS
BUT
DO
NOT
SEND
IN
TROOPS
TODAY
INSPITE
OF
ALL
THE
MIGHTTHE
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY
IS
NOT
JUST
STANDING
NEUTRAL
BUT
HAS
PLACED
AN
ARMS
EMBARGO
WHICH
BY
ALL
MEANS
LIFT
THE
EMBARGO
IS
TO
THE
OBVIOUS
DISADVANTAGE
OF
THE
WEEKER
SIDE
AND
THEREFORE
TO
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
BULLYHENCE
INDIRECLTLY
AND
POSSIBLY
UNINTENTIONALLY

WITH

THISI
THINK
IS
UNPRECEDENTED
IN
