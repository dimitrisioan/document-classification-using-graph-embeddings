AFS
SIMPLE
AS
THAT
CAN
ANYBODY
DENY
THESE
FACTS
JEWS
KILLED
GERMANS
IN
WWII
GERMANS
KILLED
JEWS
IN
WWII
BUT
THERE
WAS
QUITE
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
THESE
TWO
STATEMENTS
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
NAZI
REVISIONISTS
SAY
SY
MY
GRAND
PARENTS
WERE
LIVING
PARTLY
IN
TODAYS
ARMENIA
AND
PARTLY
IN
SY
TODAYS
GEORGIA
THERE
WERE
VILLAGES
KURDTURK
DIFFERENT
TURKIC
GROUPS
SY
GEORGIAN
MUSLIMCHRISTIAN
ARMENIAN
AND
FARSI
VERY
NEAR
TO
EACHOTHER
SY
THE
PEOPLE
LIVING
THERE
WERE
AWARE
OF
THEIR
DIFFERENCES
THEY
WERE
SY
DIFFERENT
PEOPLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
MY
GRANDFATHER
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
HAPPY
SY
IF
HIS
DOUGHTER
HAD
WILLED
TO
MARRY
AN
ARMENIAN
GUY
BUT
THAT
DID
NOT
SY
MEAN
THAT
THEY
WERE
WILLING
TO
KILL
EACHOTHER
NO
THEY
WERE
NEIGHBORS
OK
SY
ARMENIANS
KILLED
TURKS
WHICH
ARMENIANS
THEIR
NEOGHBORS
AS
FAR
AS
MY
SY
GRANDPARENTS
ARE
CONCERNED
THE
ARMENIANS
ATTACKED
FIRST
BUT
THESE
SY
ARMENIANS
WERE
NOT
THEIR
NEIGHBORS
THEY
CAME
FROM
OTHER
PLACES
MAYBE
SY
FIRST
THEY
HAD
A
TRAINING
AT
SOME
PLACE
THEY
WERE
TAUGHT
TO
KILL
PEOPLE
SY
TO
HATE
TURKSKURDS
IT
SEEMS
SO
THERE
IS
CERTAINLY
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
PLANNED
EXTERMINATION
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
OF
EASTERN
TURKEY
BEGINNING
IN
WITH
THAT
OF
THE
ARMENO
GEORGIAN
CONFLICTS
OF
LATE
THE
ARGUMENT
IS
NOT
WHETHER
ARMENIANS
EVER
KILLED
IN
THEIR
COLLECTIVE
EXISTENCE
BUT
RATHER
THE
WHOLESALE
DESTRUCTION
OF
ANATOLIAN
ARMENIANS
UNDER
ORDERS
OF
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
AN
ARMENIAN
GEORGIAN
DISPUTE
OVER
THE
DISPOSITION
OF
AKHALKALAK
LORI
AND
PAMBAK
AFTER
THE
TURKISH
THIRD
ARMY
EVACUATED
THE
REGION
CANNOT
BE
EQUATED
WITH
THE
EXTERMINATION
OF
ANATOLIAN
ARMENIANS
MANY
ARMENIANS
AND
GEORGIANS
DIED
IN
THIS
AREA
IN
THE
SCRAMBLE
TO
REOCCUPY
THESE
LANDS
AND
THE
LACK
OF
PREPARATION
FOR
THE
WINTER
MONTHS
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
TURKISH
GENOCIDE
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
NEARLY
FOUR
YEARS
EARLIER
HUNDREDS
OF
KILOMETERS
AWAY
SY
ANYWAY
BUT
AFTER
THEY
KILLEDRAPED
TURKS
AND
OTHER
MUSLIM
PEOPLE
SY
AROUND
PEOPLE
ASSUMED
THAT
ARMENIANS
KILLED
US
RAPED
OUR
WOMEN
SY
NOT
A
PARTICULAR
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
TRAINED
IN
SOME
CAMPS
MAYBE
BACKED
SY
BY
SOME
POWERFUL
STATES
AFTER
THAT
STEP
YOU
CANNOT
EXPLAIN
THESE
SY
PEOPLE
NOT
TO
HATE
ALL
ARMENIANS
I
DONT
FOLLOW
PERHAPS
THE
NEXT
PARAGRAPH
WILL
SHED
SOME
LIGHT
SY
SO
WHAT
AM
I
TRYING
TO
POINT
OUT
FIRST
AT
LEAST
FOR
THAT
REGION
SY
YOU
CANNOT
BLAME
TURKSKURDS
ETC
SINCE
IT
WAS
A
SELF
DEFENSE
SITUATION
SY
MOST
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
I
THINK
ARE
NOT
TO
BLAME
EITHER
BUT
SINCE
SOME
SY
PEOPLE
STARTED
THAT
FIRE
IT
IS
NOT
EASY
TO
UNDO
IT
THERE
ARE
FACTS
SY
PEOPLE
CANNOT
TRUST
EACHOTHER
EASILY
IT
IS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
ESTABLISH
SY
A
GOOD
RELATION
BASED
ON
MUTUAL
RESPECT
AND
TRUST
BETWEEN
NATIONS
WITH
SY
DIFFERENT
ETHNICCULTURALRELIGIOUS
BACKGROUNDS
BUT
IT
IS
UNFORTUNATELY
SY
VERY
EASY
TO
START
A
FIRE
AGAIN
THE
FIGHTING
BETWEEN
ARMENIANS
AND
GEORGIANS
IN
HAD
LITTLE
TO
DO
WITH
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
TURKEY
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THAT
THE
GEORGIAN
LEADERS
OF
THE
TRANSCAUCASIAN
FEDERATION
ARMENIA
AZERBAIJAN
AND
GEORGIA
MADE
SPECIAL
DEALS
WITH
TURKISH
GENERALS
NOT
TO
PASS
THROUGH
TIFLIS
ON
THEIR
WAY
TO
BAKU
IN
RETURN
FOR
GEORGIANS
NOT
HELPING
THE
ARMENIANS
MILITARILY
OF
COURSE
AS
TURKISH
TROOPS
MARCHED
ACROSS
WHAT
WAS
LEFT
OF
CAUCASIAN
ARMENIA
MANY
ARMENIANS
WENT
NORTH
AND
SUCH
POPULATION
MOVEMENT
CAUSED
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
LOCALS
THIS
IS
IN
NO
COMPARISON
WITH
EVENTS
YEARS
EARLIER
IN
EASTERN
ANATOLIA
MY
FATHERS
MOTHERS
FAMILY
ESCAPED
CEMISKEZEK
ERZINKA
ERZERUM
NAKHITCHEVAN
TIFLIS
CONSTANTINOPLE
MASSACHUSETTS
SY
MY
GRANDPARENTS
WERE
NOT
BLOODTHIRSTY
PEOPLE
WE
DID
NOT
EXPERIENCE
SY
WHAT
THEY
HAD
TO
ENDURE
THEY
HAD
TO
LEAVE
THEIR
LANDS
THERE
WERE
SY
LADIES
OLD
LADIES
ALL
OF
HER
CHILDREN
KILLED
WHILE
SHE
FORCED
TO
SY
WITNESS
YOUNG
WOMEN
PUT
DIRT
AT
THEIR
FACE
TO
MAKE
THEMSELVES
SY
UNATTRACTIVE
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GO
INTO
ANY
GRAPHIC
DETAIL
MY
GRANDMOTHERS
BROTHER
WAS
FORCED
TO
DRESS
UP
AS
A
KURDISH
WOMEN
AND
PASTE
POTATO
SKINS
ON
HIS
FACE
TO
LOOK
UGLY
THE
TURKS
WOULD
KILL
ANY
ARMENIAN
YOUNG
MAN
ON
SIGHT
IN
DERSIM
BECAUSE
THEIR
FAMILY
WAS
RATHER
INFLUENTIAL
LOCAL
KURDS
HELPED
THEM
ESCAPE
BEFORE
IT
WAS
TOO
LATE
THIS
IS
WHY
I
AM
ALIVE
TODAY
SY
YOU
MAY
THINK
THAT
MY
SOURCES
ARE
BIASED
THEY
WERE
BIASED
IN
SOME
SENSE
SY
THEY
EXPERIENCED
THEIR
OWN
PAIN
OF
COURSE
THAT
IS
THE
WAY
IT
IS
BUT
SY
AS
I
SAID
THEY
WERE
LIVING
IN
PEACE
WITH
THEIR
NEIGHBORS
BEFORE
WHY
SY
SHOULD
THEY
BECOME
