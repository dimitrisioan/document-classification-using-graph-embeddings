I
LIKE
WHAT
MR
JOSEPH
BIDEN
HAD
TO
SAY
YESTERDAY
IN
THE
SENATE
CONDEMENING
THE
EUROPEAN
LACK
OF
ACTION
AND
LACK
OF
SUPPORT
TO
US
PLANS
AND
CALLING
THAT
MORAL
RAPE
IT
IS
EASY
FOR
SEN
BIDEN
TO
SAY
THAT
WHEN
THERE
ARE
NO
US
TROOPS
IN
ZEPA
OR
SREBINICA
OR
SAREJEVO
THIS
IS
TRUE
THE
EXISTING
UN
POLICY
MAY
CERTAINING
BE
WRONG
BUT
THE
US
WANTS
TO
DICTATE
POLICY
AND
MAKE
EUROPE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
THAT
POLICY
THIS
HAS
MERIT
BUT
IS
NOT
ENTIRELY
TRUE
BOSNIA
IS
A
BIG
ENOUGH
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
US
TO
PREACH
ABOUT
WHAT
OTHER
COUNTRIES
SHOULD
BE
DOING
WITH
THEIR
FORCESBUT
ITS
FORCES
ARE
SAFELY
TUCKED
AWAY
AT
HOME
IN
THE
US
GERALD
THIS
LAST
STATEMENT
IS
NOT
TRUE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
CBO
THE
UNITED
STATES
HAS
A
FORCE
OF
ABOUT
US
ARMY
PERSONEL
IN
EUROPE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
IF
THIS
INCLUDES
A
USMC
DIVISION
IN
NORWAY
THEY
HAVE
AVAILABLE
A
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
USAF
ATTACK
AIRCRAFT
INCLUDING
VARIOUS
MODELS
OF
THE
AND
A
FEW
THERE
ARE
ABOUT
MORE
OF
THESE
AVAILABLE
SAFELY
TUCKED
AWAY
AT
HOME
AT
ONE
TIME
THE
US
MAINTAINED
MBTS
ABOUT
HALF
WERE
BUT
SOME
OF
THESE
WERE
RELOCATED
TO
THE
PERSIAN
GULF
I
KNOW
THE
US
HAS
AT
LEAST
ONE
AIRCRAFT
CARRIER
BATTLE
GROUP
NEARBY
AND
PROBABLY
A
MARINE
ASSAULT
BRIGADE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
IN
ENGLAND
THE
POINT
IS
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
NO
US
GROUND
TROOPS
IN
BOSNIA
IT
IS
NOT
TRUE
THAT
THAT
ALL
THE
AMERICAN
FORCES
ARE
SAFELY
CAMPED
OUTSIDE
OF
ST
LOUIS
I
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
PLANNING
TO
POSITION
TROOPS
IN
MACEDONIA
ANY
REACTION
OUT
THERE
TO
THIS
QUESTION
DAY
BEFORE
YESTERDAY
I
HEARD
THAT
SERBIA
MONTENEGRO
HAD
IMPOSED
ADDITIONAL
TRADE
SANCTIONS
AGAINST
THE
BOSNIAN
SERB
REBELS
THIS
MORNING
A
NPR
REPORTED
AT
A
BRIDGE
ON
THE
DRINA
SP
VERIFIED
THAT
ONLY
A
BREAD
TRUCK
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
PASS
THROUGH
TO
BOSNIA
A
SERBIAN
WHO
HAPPENED
TO
BE
MUSLIM
STATED
THAT
JUST
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
NO
VEHICLE
EVEN
SLOWED
FOR
THE
BOARDER
STATION
NOW
EVERYONE
IS
STOPPED
AND
SEARCHED
MANY
ARE
TURNED
BACK
OF
COURSE
ALL
I
HEARD
WAS
A
TRANSLATORS
VERSION
I
DO
NOT
SPEAK
SERBOCROATIAN
IF
THIS
IS
A
EFFORT
ON
THE
PART
OF
SERBIA
MONTENEGRO
FOR
WHATEVER
REASON
TO
PUSH
THE
BOSERBS
INTO
ACCEPTING
THE
VO
IS
THIS
NOT
A
GOOD
THING
PEACE
