RE
FREEDOM
IN
USA
IN
ANDI
BEYER
WROTE
WRITES
DEAR
MR
BEYER
IT
IS
NEVER
WISE
TO
CONFUSE
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
WITH
FREEDOM
OF
RACISM
AND
VIOLENT
DERAGATORY
IT
IS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
MANY
FAIL
TO
UNDERSTAND
THIS
CRUCIAL
DISTINCTION
IN
FACT
IF
A
SPEACH
WAS
NOT
OFFENSIVE
TO
SOME
ITS
PROTECTION
UNDER
FREEDOM
OF
SPEACH
LAWS
WOULD
BE
USELESS
IT
IS
SPEACH
THAT
SOME
FIND
QUESTIONABLE
THAT
MUST
BE
PROTECTED
BE
IT
RELIGIOUSLY
BLASPHEMOUS
OR
INHERENTLY
RACIST
IT
IS
ONLY
THROUGH
CIVILIZED
DISCOURSE
AND
NOT
SCARE
TACTICS
THAT
ONE
CAN
ENLIGHTEN
THOSE
THAT
ONE
PERCEIVES
TO
BE
IGNORANT
THAT
IS
THE
IDEA
BEHIND
FREEDOM
OF
EXPRESSION
WHAT
YOU
FIND
OFFENSIVE
MIGHT
BE
PERCEIVED
AS
TRUTH
BY
SOME
AND
WHAT
THEY
MIGHT
FIND
OFFENSIVE
MIGHT
BE
YOUR
BELIEF
IT
IS
ONLY
THROUGH
FREE
EXCHANGE
OF
IDEAS
AND
INSULTS
AS
THE
CASE
SEEMS
TO
BE
WITH
THIS
CHANNEL
THAT
ONE
CAN
CHANGE
ANOTHERS
ERRING
WAYSTHAT
IS
WHY
JEFFERSON
SAID
THAT
HERE
WE
ARE
NOT
AFRAID
TO
TOLERATE
ERROR
SO
LONG
AS
REASON
IS
LEFT
TO
COMBAT
IT
DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
YOU
ARE
VOLUNTEERING
TO
WADE
THROUGH
THE
MUTLUARGIC
DELUGE
THAT
COMES
IN
EVERY
DAY
SOME
OF
US
ARE
TIRED
OF
BEING
DRAGGED
INTO
CONTENTFREE
PISSING
CONTESTS
WITH
REFLEXIVE
BIGOTS
WE
INTENSELY
DISLIKE
BEING
STUCK
BETWEEN
LETTING
THIS
CRAP
PASS
WITHOUT
COMMENT
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
UNREMARKABLE
AND
REPLYING
TO
IT
AND
GETTING
SUCKED
IN
AGAIN
LETS
KEEP
SOME
PERSPECTIVE
HERE
IMHO
THE
JOSHS
POLICY
OF
FORWARDING
THE
GARBAGE
IN
QUESTION
WITHOUT
COMMENT
TO
THE
RELEVANT
SYSADMIN
STRIKES
A
GOOD
BALANCE
THE
STUFF
WAS
AFTER
ALL
PUBLISHED
ON
A
PUBLIC
FORUM
FROM
THAT
VERY
SITE
YET
HARDLY
A
MATTER
OF
CONFIDENTIALITY
OR
COPYRIGHT
IF
THE
LOCAL
ADMINISTRATION
WANTS
TO
DO
SOMETHING
ABOUT
IT
THEY
