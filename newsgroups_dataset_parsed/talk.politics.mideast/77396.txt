i
find
it
interesting
that
mr
major
finds
the
genocide
of
two
million
muslims
in
bosnia
acceptable
now
you
are
actually
claiming
that
muslims
have
been
killed
in
bh
what
if
we
remove
one
zeron
and
make
it
the
genocide
of
two
hundred
thousands
muslims
in
bosnia
would
that
make
it
any
better
and
how
about
the
muslims
who
were
driven
and
continue
to
be
driven
out
of
their
homes
is
that
utterly
ridiculous
claim
and
how
about
the
rapes
over
women
and
the
concentration
camps
the
us
delegation
which
visited
them
reported
yesterday
on
cnn
that
the
serbs
are
giving
the
muslims
detainees
biscuits
and
a
cup
of
water
a
day
that
sure
also
sounds
like
an
utterly
ridiculous
claim
please
substantiate
this
utterly
ridiculous
claim
