MY
RESPONSE
TO
THE
SHOOTING
DOWN
OF
A
TURKISH
AIRPLANE
OVER
THE
HENRIK
ARMENIAN
AIR
SPACE
WAS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
IGNORANT
POSTING
OF
THE
HENRIK
PERSON
FROM
YOUR
COUNTRY
TURKS
AND
AZERIS
CONSISTANTLY
WANT
TO
HENRIK
DRAG
ARMENIA
INTO
THE
KARABAKH
CONFLICT
WITH
AZERBAIJAN
THE
HENRIK
KARABAKHIARMENIANS
WHO
HAVE
LIVED
IN
THEIR
HOMELAND
FOR
HENRIK
YEARS
CUT
OFF
FROM
ARMENIA
AND
GIVEN
TO
AZERIS
BY
STALIN
ARE
HENRIK
THE
ONES
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CONFLICT
THEY
ARE
DEFENDING
HENRIK
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
AZERI
AGGRESSION
AGRESSION
THAT
HAS
NO
MERCY
HENRIK
FOR
INOCENT
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
COSTANTLY
SHELLED
WITH
AND
HENRIK
OTHE
RUSSIAN
AIRCRAFT
HENRIK
AT
LAST
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
US
INSISTS
THAT
TURKEY
STAY
OUT
OF
THE
HENRIK
KARABAKH
CRISIS
SO
THAT
THE
REPEAT
OF
THE
CYPRUS
INVASION
WILL
HENRIK
NEVER
OCCUR
AGAIN
DA
ARMENIA
IS
INVOLVED
IN
FIGHTING
WITH
AZARBAIJAN
IT
IS
ARMENIAN
DA
SOLDIERS
FROM
MAINLAND
ARMENIA

ARE
SHELLING

AZARBAIJAN
WELL
THIS
IS
YOUR
OPINION
TURKISH
AZERIS

SINCE
THE
ABOVE
IS
UNTRUE
HOWEVER
I
AM
SURE

HAD
HAD
HEAVY
LOSSES

MIGHT
WISH
TO
READ
MORE
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT

AZERI
AGGRESSION

ONLY
IN
THAT
REGION

SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
BETTER
DA
ORGANIZED
HAVE
MORE
SUCCESS
MILITARILY
AND
SHELL
AZERI
TOWNS
DA
REPEATEDLY
READ
WHAT
THE
NEW

ANTIARMENIAN
ARTICLES
NOP
I
HAVE
MY
RESOURCES
LOOK
EVERYONE
KNOWS
HOW
AGGRESSIVE
TURKSAZERIS
HAVE
BEEN
IN
THE
PAST
ARMENIANS
ARE
NOT
GONA
SIT
AROUND
AND
WATCH
FIRE
WORKS
BY
AZERIS
TAUGHT
BY
TURKS
DA
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
BETTER
ORGANIZED
HAVE
MORE
SUCCESS

SHELL
AZERI
TOWNS
REPEATEDLY

GO
AHEAD
REPEAT
AS
MUCH
AS
YOU
WANT

I
DONT

GET
INTO
THE
CYPRUS
DISCUSSION
TURKEY
HAD
THE
RIGHT
TO
DA
INTERVENE
AND
IT
DID
PERHAPS
THE
INTERVENTION
WAS
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
DA
LAST
FOR
SO
LONG
BUT
THE
CONSTANT
REFUSAL
OF
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENTS
BOTH
DA
ON
THE
ISLAND
AND
IN
GREECE
TO
DEAL
WITH
REALITY
IS
ALSO
TO
BE
BLAMED
DA
FOR
THE
ONGOING
STANDOFF
IN
THE
REGION
NOT
A
CHANCE
YOU
CAN
NOT
CONVINCE
ME
BASED
ON
