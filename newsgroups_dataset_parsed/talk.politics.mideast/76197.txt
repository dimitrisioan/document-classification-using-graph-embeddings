RE
ISRAELI
TERRORISM
ANDI
BEYER
WRITES
I
THINK
THE
ISRAELI
PRESS
MIGHT
BE
A
TAD
BIT
BIASED
IN
REPORTING
THE
EVENTS
I
DOUBT
THE
PROPAGANDA
MACHINE
OF
GOERING
REPORTED
ACCURATELY
ON
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
IN
GERMANY
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THAT
YOU
ARE
BASING
THE
TRUTH
ON
ISRAELI
PROPAGANDA
IF
YOU
CONSIDER
ISRAELI
REPORTING
OF
EVENTS
IN
ISRAEL
TO
BE
PROPOGANDA
THEN
CONSIDER
THE
WASHINGTON
POSTS
HANDLING
OF
AMERICAN
EVENTS
TO
BE
PROPOGANDA
TOO
WHAT
MAKES
THE
ISRAELI
PRESS
INHERENTLY
BIASED
IN
YOUR
OPINION
I
WOULDNT
COMPARE
IT
TO
NAZI
PROPOGANDA
EITHER
UNLESS
YOU
WANT
TO
PROVIDE
SOME
EVIDENCE
OF
ISRAELI
INACCURACIES
OR
PARALLELS
TO
NAZISM
I
SUGGEST
YOU
KEEP
YOUR
MOUTH
SHUT
IM
SICK
AND
TIRED
OF
ALL
YOU
ANTISEMITES
COMPARING
ISRAEL
TO
THE
NAZIS
AND
YES
IN
MY
OPINION
IF
YOU
COMPARE
ISRAEL
TO
THE
NAZIS
YOU
ARE
AN
ANTISEMITE
BECAUSE
YOU
KNOW
DAMN
WELL
IT
ISNT
TRUE
AND
YOU
ARE
JUST
TRYING
TO
DISCREDIT
ISRAEL
