hassan
and
some
other
seemed
not
to
be
a
ware
that
jews
celebrating
on
these
days
thje
passover
holliday
the
holidy
of
going
a
way
from
the
nile
so
if
one
let
his
imagination
freely
work
it
seemed
beter
to
write
that
the
zionist
drean
is
from
the
misisipi
to
the
nile
the
question
is
by
going
east
or
west
from
the
misisipi
on
either
choice
you
would
loose
palestine
or
broklyn
ny
i
thought
youre
gonna
say
fromn
misisipi
back
to
the
misisipi
by
the
way
what
are
the
borders
the
islamic
world
dreams
about
islamic
readers
i
am
waiting
to
your
honest
answer
lets
say
lets
establish
the
islamic
state
first
or
lets
free
our
occupied
lands
first
and
then
we
can
dream
about
expansion
