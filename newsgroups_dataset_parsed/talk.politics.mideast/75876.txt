re
no
humanity
in
bosnia
it
is
very
encouraging
that
a
number
of
people
took
so
interest
in
my
postingi
recieved
a
couple
of
letters
toosome
has
debated
the
statement
that
events
in
bosnia
are
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
modern
worldthose
who
contest
this
statement
present
the
figures
of
the
world
war
iihowever
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
it
was
a
world
war
and
no
country
had
the
power
to
stop
ittoday
is
the
matter
not
of
the
power
but
of
the
willit
seems
to
be
that
what
we
lack
is
the
will
second
point
of
difference
which
makes
it
different
from
the
holocastsp
is
that
at
that
time
international
community
didnot
have
enough
muscle
to
prevent
the
unfortunate
event
today
inspite
of
all
the
mightthe
international
community
is
not
just
standing
neutral
but
has
placed
an
arms
embargo
which
is
to
the
obvious
disadvantage
of
the
weeker
side
and
therefore
to
the
advantage
of
the
bullyhence
indirecltly
and
possibly
unintentionally
mankind
has
sided
with
the
killersand
thisi
think
is
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
the
modern
world
