the
armenians
in
nagarnokarabagh
are
simply
defending
their
henrik
rights
to
keep
their
homeland
and
it
is
the
azeris
that
are
henrik
invading
their
homeland
he
homeland
first
nagarnokarabagh
was
armenians
homeland
today
he
fizuli
lacin
and
several
villages
in
azerbadjan
he
are
their
homeland
cant
you
see
the
he
the
great
armenia
dream
in
this
with
facist
methods
like
he
killing
raping
and
bombing
villages
the
last
move
was
the
he
blast
of
a
truck
with
kurdish
refugees
trying
to
he
escape
the
from
lacin
a
city
that
was
given
to
the
kurds
he
by
the
armenians
nagornokarabakh
is
in
azerbaijan
not
armenia
armenians
have
lived
in
nagorno
karabakh
ever
since
there
were
armenians
armenians
used
to
live
in
the
areas
between
armenia
and
nagornokarabakh
and
this
area
is
being
used
to
invade
nagorno
karabakh
armenians
are
defending
themselves
if
azeris
are
dying
because
of
a
policy
of
attacking
armenians
then
something
is
wrong
with
this
policy
if
i
recall
correctly
it
was
stalin
who
caused
all
this
problem
with
land
in
the
first
place
not
the
armenians
henrik
however
i
hope
that
the
armenians
will
force
a
turkish
airplane
henrik
to
land
for
purposes
of
searching
for
arms
similar
to
the
one
henrik
that
happened
last
summer
turkey
searched
an
american
plane
henrik
carrying
humanitarian
aid
bound
to
armenia
he
dont
speak
about
things
you
dont
know
us
cargo
planes
he
were
heading
to
armenia
when
the
turkish
authorities
he
announced
that
they
were
going
to
search
these
cargo
he
planes
of
these
planes
returned
to
its
base
in
germany
he
of
these
planes
were
searched
in
turkey
the
content
of
he
of
the
other
planes
not
hard
to
guess
is
it
it
was
sure
not
he
humanitarian
aid
what
story
are
you
talking
about
planes
from
the
us
have
been
sending
aid
into
armenian
for
two
years
i
would
not
like
to
guess
about
what
were
in
the
planes
in
your
story
i
would
like
to
find
out
he
search
turkish
planes
you
dont
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
turkeys
government
has
announced
that
its
giving
weapons
he
to
azerbadjan
since
armenia
started
to
attack
azerbadjan
he
it
self
not
the
karabag
province
so
why
search
a
plane
for
weapons
he
since
its
content
is
announced
to
be
weapons
its
too
bad
you
would
want
turkey
to
start
a
war
with
armenia
