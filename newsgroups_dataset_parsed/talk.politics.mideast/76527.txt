THE
ARMENIANS
IN
NAGARNOKARABAGH
ARE
SIMPLY
DEFENDING
THEIR
HENRIK
RIGHTS
TO
KEEP
THEIR
HOMELAND
AND
IT
IS
THE
AZERIS
THAT
ARE
HENRIK
INVADING
THEIR
HOMELAND
HE
HOMELAND
FIRST
NAGARNOKARABAGH
WAS

HE
THE
GREAT
ARMENIA
DREAM
IN
THIS
WITH
FACIST
METHODS
LIKE

KILLING
RAPING

ARMENIANS
HAVE
LIVED
IN
NAGORNO
KARABAKH
EVER
SINCE
THERE
WERE
ARMENIANS
ARMENIANS
USED
TO
LIVE
IN
THE
AREAS
BETWEEN

AND
NAGORNOKARABAKH
AND
THIS
AREA
IS
BEING
USED
TO
INVADE
NAGORNO
KARABAKH
ARMENIANS
ARE
DEFENDING
THEMSELVES
IF
AZERIS
ARE
DYING
BECAUSE
OF
A
POLICY
OF
ATTACKING
ARMENIANS
THEN
SOMETHING
IS
WRONG
WITH
THIS
POLICY
IF
I
RECALL
CORRECTLY
IT
WAS
STALIN
WHO
CAUSED
ALL
THIS
PROBLEM
WITH
LAND
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
NOT
THE
ARMENIANS
HENRIK
HOWEVER
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
WILL
FORCE
A
TURKISH
AIRPLANE
HENRIK
TO
LAND
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
SEARCHING
FOR
ARMS
SIMILAR
