re
israeli
terrorism
andi
beyer
writes
well
im
not
sure
about
the
story
nad
it
did
seem
biased
what
i
disagree
with
is
your
statement
that
the
us
media
is
out
to
ruin
israels
reputation
that
is
rediculous
the
us
media
is
the
most
proisraeli
media
in
the
world
having
lived
in
europe
i
realize
that
incidences
such
as
the
one
described
in
the
letter
have
occured
the
us
media
as
a
whole
seem
to
try
to
ignore
them
the
us
is
subsidizing
israels
existance
and
the
europeans
are
not
at
least
not
to
the
same
degree
so
i
think
that
might
be
a
reason
they
report
more
clearly
on
the
atrocities
what
is
a
shame
is
that
in
austria
daily
reports
of
the
inhuman
acts
commited
by
israeli
soldiers
and
the
blessing
received
from
the
government
makes
some
of
the
holocaust
guilt
go
away
after
all
look
how
the
jews
are
treating
other
races
when
they
got
power
it
is
unfortunate
well
