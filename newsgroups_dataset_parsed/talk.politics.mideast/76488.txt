RE
ISRAELS
EXPANSION
BECAUSE
THE
USA
IS
BANKRUPT
AND
SIMPLY
CANNOT
AFFORD
TO
FINANCE
THE
ISRAELI
ECCONOMY
ANY
MORE
THERE
IS
NO
MONEY
FOR
SUCH
AN
OCCUPATION
DONT
FOOL
YOURSELF
IT
WAS
THE
GULF
WAR
THAT
BROUGHT
THE
ISRAELIS
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
ONCE
THEIR
US
BACKERS
HAD
A
SECURE
BASE
IN
THE
GULF
THEY
INSRTRUCTED
SHAMIR
TO
NEGOTIATE
OR
ELSE
PHILL
HALLAMBAKER
OH
WHY
DO
YOU
EXPOSE
YOUR
IGNORANCE
THE
US
HAS
BEEN
RUNNING
ON
DEBT
FOR
THE
PAST
FOUR
GENERATIONS
AND
HAS
STILL
FINANCED
WHAT
IT
PLEASES
AND
AFTER
THE
GULF
WAR
ISRAEL
COULD
DO
WHATEVER
IT
WANTED
AFTER
NOT
DECIMATING
IRAQ
AFTER
THE
SCUD
ATTACKS
IT
WAS
ENCOURAGED
BUT
BY
NO
MEANS
FORCED
TO
NEGOTIATE
MR
BAKER
TO
ADDRESS
ALL
OF
YOUR
POINTS
WOULD
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
BUT
IN
A
NUTSHELL
IT
IS
HYPOCRITICAL
FOR
YOU
TO
ATTACK
ISRAELS
PRESENCE
IN
LEBANON
WITHOUT
ATTACKING
SYRIA
SYRIAN
OCCUPATION
HAS
BEEN
HOSTILE
AND
AMOUNTS
TO
ANNEXATION
ISRAELS
IS
CLEARLY
DEFENSIVE
IF
IT
WERE
NOT
DEFENSIVE
YOU
WOULD
SEE
ALL
OF
LEBANON
OCCUPIED
AND
GOVERNED
BY
ISRAEL
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
ISRAEL
WANTS
PETE
