PBS
FRONTLINE
IRAN
AND
THE
BOMB
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SHARE
WITH
NETTERS
A
FEW
POINTS
I
PICKED
UP
FROM
THE
PBS
FRONTLINE
PROGRAM
REGARDING
IRANS
NUCLEAR
ACTIVITIES
AIRED
ON
TUESDAY
APRIL
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
BREVITY
ILL
PRESENT
THEM
IN
SOME
SEPARATE
POINTS
AS
MANY
OTHER
WESTERN
PROGRAMS
THIS
PROGRAM
WAS
LAID
ON
A
BED
OF
MISINFORMATION
THROUGHOUT
THE
PROGRAM
TO
MAXIMIZE
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
PROGRAM
ON
THE
VIEWER
SOME
OF
THE
MISINFORMATIONS
WERE
AS
FOLLOWS
IT
WAS
ALLEGED
THAT
LATE
IMAM
KHOMEINI
OBJECTED
TO
SHAHS
TECHNOLOGICAL
ADVANCEMENTS
AS
ANTIISLAMIC
BUT
NOW
THINGS
HAVE
CHANGED
AND
THE
PROOF
OF
CHANGE
IS
THAT
SOME
IRANIAN
MERCHANTS
ARE
NOW
SELLING
PERSONAL
COMPUTERS
THESE
ARE
THE
MOST
RIDICULOUS
LIES
ONE
CAN
MAKE
ABOUT
THE
OBJECTIVES
OF
THE
ISLAMIC
REVOLUTION
IN
TOPPLING
THE
SHAH
AND
STATE
OF
THE
TECHNOLOGY
IN
IRAN
AFTER
REVOLUTION
IRAN
WAS
EQUALLY
ACCUSED
OF
USING
CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
AGAINST
IRAQI
AGGRESSORS
WHILE
THERE
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
ANY
PROOF
IN
THIS
REGARD
AND
NOBODY
HAS
SEEN
IRAQI
SOLDIERS
OR
CIVILIANS
INJURED
BY
IRANIAN
CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
IN
CONTRARY
TO
WHAT
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
HAS
SEEN
ABOUT
IRANIAN
SOLDIERS
AND
CIVILIANS
INJURED
BY
IRAQI
CHEMICAL
WEAPONS
WHILE
THE
NUMBER
OF
MARTYRS
DURING
THE
SACRED
DEFENSE
AGAINST
IRAQI
AGGRESSION
HAS
BEEN
OFFICIALLY
ANNOUNCED
TO
BE
ABOUT
AND
EVEN
MOST
RADICAL
COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY
GROUPS
CLAIM
THAT
IRAN
AND
IRAQ
HAD
A
TOTAL
OF
ONE
MILLION
DEAD
THIS
PROGRAM
CLAIMS
THAT
IRAN
ALONE
HAS
ONE
MILLION
DEAD
LEFT
FROM
THE
WAR
THE
TRANSLATION
OF
IRANIAN
OFFICIALS
TALKS
ARE
NOT
TRUE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHEN
IRANIAN
HEAD
OF
ATOMIC
ENERGY
SAYS
THAT
IT
HURTS
ME
TO
SEE
THAT
IRAN
IS
THE
SUBJECT
OF
THESE
UNFRIENDLY
PROPAGANDA
THE
TRANSLATOR
SAYS
IT
HURTS
TO
SEE
THAT
IRAN
IS
DOING
UNFRIENDLY
RESEARCH
ALMOST
ALL
ALLEGED
DEVICES
OR
MATERIAL
BOUGHT
OR
PLANNED
TO
BE
BOUGHT
BY
IRANIANS
WERE
OF
COUNTLESS
DUAL
USAGE
WHILE
THE
PROGRAM
TRIES
TO
UNDERMINE
THEIR
NONMILITARY
USES
WITHOUT
ANY
REFERENCE
TO
IRANS
BIG
POPULATION
AND
ITS
INEVITABLE
NEED
TO
OTHER
SOURCES
OF
ENERGY
IN
NEAR
FUTURE
AND
ITS
CURRENT
DEFICIT
IN
ELECTRICAL
POWER
THE
WHOLE
PROGRAM
IS
TRYING
TO
SHOW
THE
SHARIF
UNIVERSITY
OF
TECHNOLOGY
AS
A
NUCLEAR
RESEARCH
CENTER
WHILE
EVEN
THE
CAMERAMEN
OF
THE
PROGRAM
KNOW
WELL
THAT
IN
A
COUNTRY
LIKE
IRAN
WITHOUT
A
SO
TIGHTLY
CLOSED
SOCIETY
NO
ONE
CAN
MAKE
A
NUCLEAR
BOMB
IN
A
UNIVERSITY
TAKING
IN
ACCOUNT
THE
SCIENTIFIC
ADVANCEMENT
OF
SHARIF
U
IN
ENGINEERING
FIELDS
AND
ITS
POTENTIAL
ROLE
IN
IMPROVEMENT
OF
IRANS
INDUSTRIES
AND
EVENTUALLY
THE
LIVES
OF
PEOPLE
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
THEY
ARE
PERSUADING
OTHER
COUNTRIES
TO
PREVENT
THEM
FROM
FURTHER
HELPING
THIS
UNIVERSITY
OR
OTHER
ONES
IN
SCIENTIFIC
AND
INDUSTRIAL
EFFORTS
A
KEY
POINT
IN
PROGRAMS
JUSTIFICATIONS
IS
TRYING
TO
DISVALIDATE
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
ALL
EFFORTS
DONE
BY
IAEA
IN
THEIR
NUMEROUS
VISITS
FROM
IRANS
DIFFERENT
SITES
THEY
SAY
WE
ARE
NOT
SURE
IF
THE
PLACES
VISITED
BY
IAEA
ARE
THE
REAL
ONES
OR
NOT
OR
WE
CAN
NOT
RELY
ON
IAEAS
REPORTS
AND
OBSERVATION
BECAUSE
THEY
FAILED
TO
SEE
IRAQS
NUCLEAR
ACTIVITIES
BEFORE
AS
IF
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
THAT
IRAQ
WAS
TRYING
TO
BUILD
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
AS
AN
EXTREMELY
PERSONAL
OPINION
THE
MOST
DISGUSTING
ASPECT
OF
THE
PROGRAM
WAS
THE
ARROGANCE
OF
THE
MEMBER
OF
US
SENATE
FOREIGN
AFFAIRS
WILLIAM
TRIPLET
IN
HIS
WAY
OF
TALKING
AS
IF
HE
WAS
THE
GOD
TALKING
FROM
THE
ABSOLUTE
KNOWLEDGE
I
HOPE
ALL
IRANIANS
BE
AWARE
OF
THE
GRADUAL
BUILDUP
AGAINST
THEIR
COUNTRY
IN
WESTERN
MEDIA
AND
I
HOPE
IRANIAN
AUTHORITIES
CONTINUE
TO
THEIR
WISE
AND
CALCULATED
APPROACH
WITH
REGARD
TO
INTERNATIONAL
AFFAIRS
AND
PEACEFUL
COEXISTENCE
WITH
FRIENDLY
NATIONS
