IM
SURPRISED
THAT
YOU
DONT
CONSIDER
THE
ACQUISITION
OF
LAND
BY
THE
JEWS
FROM
ARABS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ESTABLISHING
AN
EXCLUSIVE
STATE
AS
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
LEADING
TO
WAR
IT
WAS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ESTABLISHING
A
STATE
NOT
AN
EXCLUSIVE
STATE
IF
THE
STATE
WAS
TO
BE
EXCLUSIVE
IT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
ARAB
CITIZENS
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHAT
WAS
THE
ETHNIC
COMPOSITION
OF
ISRAEL
RIGHT
AFTER
IT
WAS
FORMED
AND
NO
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THE
PURCHASE
OF
LAND
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
WHEN
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
BUY
LAND
AND
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
WILLING
TO
SELL
IT
AT
A
MUTUALLY
AGREEABLE
PRICE
THEN
THAT
IS
COMMERCE
IT
IS
NOT
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
LEADING
TO
WAR
NO
ONE
IN
HIS
RIGHT
MIND
WOULD
SELL
HIS
FREEDOM
AND
DIGNITY
PALESTINIANS
ARE
NO
EXCEPTION
PERHAPS
YOU
HEARD
ABOUT
ANTITRUST
IN
THE
BUSINESS
WORLD
SINCE
WE
ARE
DEBATING
THE
LEGALITY
OF
A
COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTION
WE
MUST
USE
THE
LAWS
GOVERNING
THE
GUIDELINES
AND
ETHICS
OF
SUCH
TRANSACTIONS
BASIC
ANTITRUST
LAW
SAYS
THAT
WHILE
YOU
CAN
PURCHASE
IBM
STOCKS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
INVESTING
YOU
CAN
NOT
ACQUIRE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
THOSE
SHARES
WITH
THE
INTENT
OR
CONTROLLING
IBM
YOU
CAN
DO
SO
ONLY
IF
YOU
MAKE
YOUR
INTENTIONS
CLEAR
APRIORI
CLEARLY
THE
JEWS
WHO
PURCHASED
PROPERTIES
FROM
PALASTENIANS
HAD
SOME
DESIGNS
THEY
WERE
NOT
BUYING
A
DWELLING
OR
A
REAL
ESTATE
THEY
WERE
ESTABLISHING
A
BRIDGEHEAD
FOR
THE
EUROPEAN
JEWS
THE
PALASTENIANS
SOLD
THEIR
PROPERTIES
TO
THE
JEWS
IN
THE
OLD
TRADITION
OF
ARAB
HOSPITALITY
BEING
A
MULTIETHNIC
MULTIRELIGIOUS
SOCIETY
ACCEPTING
THE
JEWS
AS
NEIGHBOURS
WAS
NO
DIFFERENT
JUST
ANOTHER
RELIGION
PLUS
THEY
PAID
FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
ETC
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
THEY
WERE
VICTIMS
OF
AN
INTERNATIONAL
CONSPIRACY
IM
NOT
A
CONSPIRACY
THEORIST
MYSELF
BUT
THIS
ONE
IS
HARD
TO
DISMISS
AS
TO
WHETHER
THE
JEWS
WANTED
TO
LIVE
IN
PEACE
MAYBE
HOWEVER
THEY
WANTED
AND
STILL
WANT
AN
EXCLUSIVELY
JEWISH
STATE
WHERE
JEWS
ARE
IN
CONTROL
AND
JEWS
ARE
THE
MASTERS
OF
THE
LAND
LIVING
IN
PEACE
IS
MEANINGLESS
UNLESS
IT
MEANS
LIVING
WITH
SOMEONE
ELSE
AS
EQUAL
FOR
A
NATIVE
ARAB
THIS
DOES
NOT
LEAVE
MANY
OPTIONS
OH
YOU
MEAN
LIKE
BOTH
JEWS
AND
ARABS
BEING
CITIZENS
THE
ARABS
WHO
STAYED
ARE
NOW
CITIZENS
WITH
AS
MUCH
RIGHT
TO
CHOOSE
WHO
THEY
VOTE
FOR
AS
THE
JEWS
AGAIN
ADAM
THE
DEVIL
IS
IN
THE
DETAILS
I
DONT
WANT
TO
GET
ON
A
TANGENT
HERE
BUT
ITS
THE
SAME
REASONNING
THAT
SAYS
ITS
OK
TO
RETURN
DEPORTES
AND
LEAVE
THE
REST
BECAUSE
IS
A
NICE
NUMBER
THAT
YOU
CAN
DEVIDE
BY
AND
BESIDES
IT
HAS
AN
INTEGER
SQUARE
ROOT
THOSE
PALESTINIANS
WHO
STAYED
ACTUALLY
STAYED
DESPITE
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
AND
THEIR
NUMBER
WAS
SOMEWHAT
TOLERATED
AS
A
DEFENSELESS
AND
INEFFECTIVE
MINORITY
IF
I
WERE
WRONG
YOUD
HAVE
ISRAEL
RECALL
ALL
THE
PALESTINIAN
REFUGEES
WERE
TALKING
MILLIONS
AFTER
ALL
THEY
ARE
CIVILIANS
HUH
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
LEFT
DID
SO
VOLUNTARILY
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
FOR
ISRAEL
TO
LET
THEM
IN
DO
YOU
ACTUALLY
BELIEVE
THIS
MY
EXPERIENCE
TELLS
ME
THAT
EVERY
PALESTINIAN
I
KNEW
STILL
KEEPS
THE
KEY
TO
HIS
HOME
IN
PALESTINE
BESIDES
THEY
OFTEN
REFER
TO
THEIR
EXODUS
AS
AN
ESCAPE
FROM
HELL
SO
TO
SPEAK
I
KNOW
NONE
THAT
AGREES
WITH
YOU
DID
YOU
SAMPLE
THEIR
OPINIONS
I
KNOW
YOU
DONT
CARE
JUST
BEING
RETHORICAL
ISRAEL
GAVE
CITIZENSHIP
TO
THE
REMAINING
ARABS
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
TO
MAINTAIN
A
DEMOCRATIC
FACADE
TO
KEEP
THE
WESTERN
AID
FLOWING
ISRAEL
GOT
NO
WESTERN
AID
IN
NOR
IN
OR
STILL
GRANTED
CITIZENSHIP
TO
THOSE
ARABS
WHO
REMAINED
AND
HOW
IS
GRANTING
CITIZENSHIP
A
FACADE
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
BELEIVE
THAT
ISRAEL
IS
DEMOCRATIC
WITHIN
THE
CONSTRAINTS
OF
ONE
DOMINANT
ETHNIC
GROUP
JEWS
ISRAEL
PROBABLY
HAD
A
FEW
OPTIONS
AFTER
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
SERBIAN
STYLE
AND
DESERVE
THE
WRATH
OF
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY
OR
MAKE
THE
BEST
OUT
OF
A
NO
WIN
CONDITION
SHOW
THE
WORLD
HOW
GOOD
ISRAEL
IS
TOWARDS
THE
BAD
ARABS
PERSONALY
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
ARAB
COMMUNITY
IN
ISREAL
EXCEPT
THAT
THEYRE
THERE
SO
YES
THEYRE
THERE
BUT
AS
A
COMMUNITY
WITH
HISTORY
AND
ROOTS
ITS
DEAD
TELL
ME
SOMETHING
SAM
WHAT
MAKES
LAND
ARAB
HOW
SHALL
I
EXPLAIN
ITS
A
CONTRACT
BETWEEN
THE
MAN
AND
THE
LAND
CONTROL
ISNT
IT
THE
OTTOMANS
RULED
YEARS
AND
THEN
LEFT
WITH
BARELY
A
TRACE
THE
CONCEPT
OF
LAND
IDENTITY
IS
SOMEWHAT
FOREIGN
TO
THE
MOBILE
AND
PRAGMATIC
WEST
IT
IS
PARTLY
THE
CONCEPT
OF
LE
SOL
NATAL
NATIVE
SOIL
I
KNOW
THAT
JEWS
HAD
PREVIOUS
HISTORY
IN
THE
REGION
BUT
NONE
IN
RECENT
MEMORY
IM
TALKING
EVERYDAY
LIFE
NOT
ARCHEOLOGY
TRY
AGAIN
YOU
TELL
ME
WHAT
ITS
ISNT
BUT
YOU
FAIL
TO
ESTABLISH
WHAT
IT
IS
ALSO
JEWS
DID
HAVE
HISTORY
IN
ISRAEL
FOR
OVER
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
THERE
WERE
LOTS
OF
JEWS
SLAUGHTERED
BY
CRUSADERS
IN
ISRAEL
THERE
WAS
A
THRIVING
COMMUNITY
IN
GAZA
CITY
FROM
ROUGHLY
JEWS
WERE
A
MAJORITY
IN
JERUSALEM
FROM
OR
SO
ONWARDS
DOES
THAT
MAKE
THE
LAND
JEWISH
I
STAND
CORRECTED
I
MEANT
THAT
THE
JEWISH
CULTURE
WAS
NOT
PREDOMINANT
IN
PALESTINE
IN
RECENT
HISTORY
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
JERUSALEM
HAVING
A
JEWISH
CHARACTER
IF
IT
WERE
PREDOMINANTLY
JEWISH
SO
THERE
WHAT
TO
MAKE
OF
THE
REST
PALESTINE
