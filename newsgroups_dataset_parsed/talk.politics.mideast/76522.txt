PLEASE
CLARIFY
YOUR
STANDARDS
FOR
RULES
OF
ENGAGEMENT
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
ISRAELIS
ARE
AT
ALL
TIMES
AND
UNDER
ALL
CIRCUMSTANCES
FAIR
TARGETS
THEIR
OPPONENTS
ARE
LEGITIMATE
TARGETS
ONLY
WHEN
MIRANDIZED
OR
SOME
SUCH
IM
SURE
THAT
THIS
MAKES
PERFECT
SENSE
IF
YOU
GRANT
APRIORI
THAT
ISRAELIS
ARE
THE
BLACK
HATS
AND
THAT
THEREFORE
KILLING
THEM
IS
AUTOMATICALLY
A
GOOD
THING
GO
HEZBOLLAH
THE
COROLLARY
IS
THAT
THE
HEZBOLLAH
ARE
THE
WHITE
HATS
AND
THAT
WHATEVER
THEY
DO
IS
A
GOOD
THING
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
ONLY
PROVE
THEMSELVES
TO
BE
BAD
GUYS
BY
ATTACKING
THEM
THIS
SOUNDS
SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE
A
HOCKEY
FAN
I
KNOW
WHO
CHEERS
WHEN
ONE
OF
THE
PLAYERS
ON
HIS
TEAM
USES
HIS
STICK
TO
PERMANENTLY
REARRANGE
AN
OPPONENTS
FACE
AND
CURSES
THE
REF
FOR
PENALIZING
HIS
SIDE
OF
COURSE
WHEN
ITS
DIFFERENT
WHEN
THE
ROLES
ARE
REVERSED
D
C
SESSIONS
WELL
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
NOTED
THAT
I
WAS
CHEERING
AN
ATTACK
ON
AN
ISRAELI
PATROL
INSIDE
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
WHILE
I
WAS
CONDEMNING
THE
RETALIATORY
SHELLING
OF
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
BY
ISRAELI
AND
ISRAELIBACKED
FORCES
MY
TEAM
YOU
SEE
WAS
PLAYING
FAIR
WHILE
THE
OPPOSING
TEAM
WAS
REARRANGING
THE
FACES
OF
THE
SPECTATORS
IN
MY
TEAMS
VIEWING
STANDS
SO
TO
SPEAK
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
TRY
TO
FIND
MORE
SOURCES
OF
NEWS
ABOUT
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
LEBANON
AND
TRY
TO
SEE
THROUGH
THE
PROPAGANDA
THERE
ARE
NO
A
PRIORI
BLACK
AND
WHITE
HATS
BUT
ONE
SURE
WONDERS
HOW
THE
IDF
CAN
BOMBARD
VILLAGES
IN
RETALIATION
TO
PINPOINT
ATTACKS
ON
ITS
SOLDIERS
IN
LEBANON
AND
THEN
CALL
THE
LEBANESE
TERRORISTS
