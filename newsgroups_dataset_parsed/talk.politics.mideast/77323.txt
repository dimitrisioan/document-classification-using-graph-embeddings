WRITES
IT
SEEMS
THAT
TO
KEEP
THE
PEACE
TALKS
GOING
ISRAEL
HAS
TO
KEEP
MAKING
GOODWILL
GESTURE
AFTER
GOODWILL
GESTURE
WHILE
PALESTINIAN
ARABS
CONTINUE
TO
GO
AROUND
HUNTING
JEWS
YOU
KNOW
THAT
PUTTING
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
OUT
ON
THE
NEWSGROUP
IS
ONLY
GOING
TO
GENERATE
FLAMES
NOT
DISCUSSION
TRY
ADDING
SOME
SUBSTANCE
TO
THE
ISSUE
OF
GESTURES
YOU
MENTIONED
IF
THE
PEACE
TALKS
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
ANY
REALISTIC
CHANCE
OF
SUCCESS
THE
ARABS
ARE
GOING
TO
HAVE
TO
START
RECIPROCATING
ESPECIALLY
SINCE
THEY
ARE
THE
ONES
WHO
WILL
BE
GETTING
TANGIBLE
CONCESSIONS
IN
RETURN
FOR
GIVING
UP
ONLY
INTANGIBLES
WHAT
IS
IT
YOU
FEEL
THAT
ISRAEL
HAS
OFFERED
AS
A
GESTURE
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
REALISTICALLY
EXPECT
TO
SEE
PRESENTED
BY
THE
ARABSPALESTINIANS
IN
THE
WAY
OF
GESTURE
IF
THEY
KEEP
TRYING
TO
CHANGE
THE
ALREADY
AGREED
UPON
RULES
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THEIR
FAVORITE
GAMES
THE
ISRAELIS
ARE
NOT
LIKELY
TO
BE
VERY
CONFIDENT
THAT
THE
INTANGIBLES
THEY
WILL
RECEIVE
AT
THE
BARGAINING
TABLE
WILL
BE
WORTH
THE
PARCHMENT
THEYRE
WRITTEN
ON
WHAT
ARE
THE
RULES
THAT
HAVE
BEEN
BENT
BY
ARAB
ACTIONS
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
THE
ISRAELI
DEPORTATIONS
WERE
SEEN
BY
THE
OTHER
SIDE
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
CHANGING
THE
RULES
IT
TAKES
TWO
TO
NEGOTIATE
A
PEACE
ITS
TIME
FOR
THE
ARABS
TO
START
DOING
THEIR
SHARE
