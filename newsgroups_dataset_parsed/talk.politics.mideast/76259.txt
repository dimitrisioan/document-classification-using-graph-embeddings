HR
VIOLATIONS
BY
ISRAELARAB
ST
MANY
OF
YOU
ASK
ME
WHETHER
I
APPROVE
OF
SEVERE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
BY
ARAB
STATES
BECUSE
I
FOCUS
ON
ISRAELI
HUMAN
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
LETS
MAKE
THINGS
CLEAR
MY
OPPOSITION
TO
HR
VIOLATIONS
IN
ARAB
STATES
IS
TOTAL
AND
WITHOUT
QUALIFICATION
NO
ARAB
STATE
IS
AND
CAN
CLAIM
TO
BE
DEMOCRATIC
NO
ARAB
STATE
CLAIMS
TO
BE
DEMOCRATIC
I
AM
BORN
IN
PALESTINE
NOW
ISRAEL
I
HAVE
FAMILY
THERE
THE
LACK
OF
PEACE
AND
UTTER
INJUSTICE
IN
MY
HOME
COUNTRY
HAS
AFFECTED
ME
ALL
MY
LIFE
I
AM
CONCERNED
BY
PALESTINE
ISRAEL
BECAUSE
I
WANT
PEACE
TO
COME
TO
IT
PEACE
AND
JUSTICE
IF
ANYBODY
HAS
LEGITIMATE
CLAIMS
TOWARDS
ARAB
STATES
HE
SHOULD
PRESENT
HIS
CLAIMS
AND
ASK
FOR
SUPPORT
JEWS
WHO
LEFT
ARAB
STATES
ARE
FULLY
ENTITLED
TO
MAKE
CLAIMS
AND
SHOULD
DO
SO
IF
THEY
CONSIDER
THEIR
CASE
HAS
A
MERIT
IT
IS
THEIR
BASIC
RIGHT
TO
RETURN
TO
THESE
COUNTRIES
IF
THEY
WISH
IF
NOT
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
COMPLAIN
AND
COMPARE
THEMSELVES
TO
THE
PALESTINIANS
WHO
HAVE
BEEN
STRUGGLING
FOR
THE
RIGHT
OF
RETURN
SINCE
ISRAEL
WAS
ESTABLISHED
AND
WHOSE
RIGHT
IS
UPHELD
BY
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
QUASI
TOTALLY
IF
JEWS
FEEL
DISCRIMINATED
IN
ARAB
COUNTRIES
THEY
HAVE
A
LEGITIMATE
CLAIM
THAT
ANY
DECENT
PERSON
CAN
AND
SHOULD
SUPPORT
HUMAN
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
BY
ARAB
STATES
DONT
JUSTIFY
LEGITIMATE
NOR
ARE
THE
CAUSE
FOR
ISRAELI
BREACHES
OF
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
AND
HUMAN
RIOGHTS
ISRAELI
BREACHES
STEM
FROM
THE
ZIONIST
CONCEPT
WHICH
CAN
ONLY
BE
IMPLEMENTED
BY
NEGATING
BASIC
RIGHTS
TO
PALESTINIANS
ISRAELI
TRIGHTS
AND
PALESTINIAN
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
SYMMETRICAL
THE
FIRST
PARTY
HAS
A
STATE
AND
THE
OTHER
HAS
NONE
THE
FIRST
IS
AN
OCCUPIER
AND
THE
SECOND
THE
OCCUPIED
FOR
ANY
MEANINGFUL
RELATIONSHIP
TO
EMERGE
SOME
SYMMETRY
MUST
BE
ESTABLISHED
AS
LONG
AS
ISRAELIS
AND
JEWS
DONT
REALISE
THE
NECESSITY
OF
A
CHANGE
OF
PERSPECTIVE
TOWARDS
THE
PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE
AND
AS
LONG
AS
ISRAELIS
AND
JEWS
DONT
WANT
TO
EXORCISE
THEIR
OWN
PAST
TOWARDS
THE
PALESTINIANS
THE
NAQBA
OF
ETC
AND
REFUSE
TO
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THE
CREATION
OF
ISRAEL
WAS
DEPENDENT
UPON
THE
REMOVAL
OF
MOST
PALESTINIAN
ARABS
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
BASE
FOR
A
REAL
TRUST
WHEN
I
READ
THE
FIRST
TIME
THE
LIST
OF
THE
ARAB
VILLAGES
DESTROYED
BY
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
IN
AND
AFTER
I
GOT
A
SHOCK
I
HOPE
OTHERS
WILL
BE
TOUCHED
BY
THIS
DISCOVERY
AND
THINK
ABOUT
THE
MEANING
OF
SUCH
MASSIVE
DESTRUCTION
AND
DESTITUTION
