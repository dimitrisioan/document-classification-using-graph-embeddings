for
the

ghetto
while
israeli
jews
fete
the
uprising
of
the
warsaw
ghetto
they
repress
by
violent
means
the
uprising
of
the
gaza
ghetto
and
attempt
to
starve
the
gazans
the
jews
in
the
warsaw
ghetto
were
fighting
to
keep
themselves
and
their
families
from
being
sent
to
nazi
gas
chambers
groups
like
hamas
and
the
islamic
jihad
fight
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
driving
all
jews
into
the
sea
perhaps
we
should
persuade
jewish
people
to
help
these
wnderful
freedom
fighters
attain
this
ultimate
goal
maybe
the
freedom
fighters
will
choose
to
spare
the
cooperative
jews
is
that
what
you
are
counting
on
elias
the
pity
of
murderers
you
say
your
mother
was
jewish
how
ashamed
she
must
be
of
her
son
i
am
sorry

ok
its
my
turn
driving
the
jews
into
the
sea
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
this
driving
the
jews
into
the
sea
sentance
attributed
to
islamic
movements
and
the
plo
it
simply
cant
be
proven
as
part
of
their
plan
this
has
been
discussed
before
by
several
people
on
this
net
the
statement
is
attributable
either
to
hajj
amin
alhusseini
former
grand
mufti
of
jerusalem
and
the
leader
of
the
palestinian
death
squads
during
the
war
or
to
one
of
his
chief
henchmen
it
was
not
coined
by
bnai
brith
or
for
that
matter
any
jewish
organization
how
sad

model
of
decorum
and
