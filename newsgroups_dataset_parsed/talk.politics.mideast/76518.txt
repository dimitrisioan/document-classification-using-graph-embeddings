i
think
that
you
should
try
to
find
more
sources
of
news
about
what
goes
on
in
lebanon
and
try
to
see
through
the
propaganda
thank
you
bradali
for
warning
us
about
the
dangers
of
propaganda
its
funny
though
coming
from
you
there
are
no
a
priori
black
and
white
hats
but
one
sure
wonders
how
the
idf
can
bombard
villages
in
retaliation
to
pinpoint
attacks
on
its
soldiers
in
lebanon
and
then
call
the
lebanese
terrorists
who
is
it
that
executes
these
pinpoint
attacks
on
israelis
the
guys
in
the
white
hats
or
the
ones
in
the
black
hats
neither
you
mean
that
they
are
just
civilians
farmers
teachers
school
children
well
maybe
they
are
terrorists
after
all
and
maybe
that
propaganda
was
correct
too
hmm
