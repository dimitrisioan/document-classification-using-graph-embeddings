hmm
maybe
ill
go
rent
midnight
express
tonight
i
havent
seen
that
scene
in
awhile
i
have
to
savor
the
moment
all
over
again
well
does
it
change
the
fact
that
during
the
period
of
to
the
fascist
xsoviet
armenian
government
ordered
incited
assisted
and
participated
in
the
genocide
of
million
muslim
people
because
of
race
religion
and
national
origin
as
in
the
past
in
turkiye
and
today
in
azerbaijan
for
utopic
and
idiotic
causes
the
armenians
brought
havoc
to
their
neighbors
a
shortsighted
and
misplaced
nationalistic
fervor
with
a
wrong
agenda
and
anachronistic
methods
the
armenians
continue
to
become
pernicious
for
the
region
as
usual
they
will
be
treated
accordingly
by
their
neighbors
nagornokarabag
is
a
mountainous
enclave
that
lies
completely
within
azerbaijan
with
no
border
or
history
whatsoever
connected
to
xsoviet
armenia
besides
the
geographical
aspect
nagornokarabag
is
the
historic
homeland
and
the
cradle
of
the
artistic
and
literary
heritage
of
azerbaijan
which
renders
the
armenian
claims
preposterous
even
lunatic
and
we
still
demand
that
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
as
the
heirs
of
the
armenian
dictatorship
recognize
the
turkish
genocide
that
xsoviet
armenia
return
the
historic
homeland
to
the
turkish
and
kurdish
people
that
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
make
material
reparations
for
their
heinous
and
unspeakable
crime
to
the
victims
of
the
turkish
genocide
that
all
world
governments
officially
recognize
the
turkish
genocide
and
turkish
territorial
rights
and
refuse
to
succumb
to
all
armenian
political
pressure
the
awareness
of
the
turkish
people
of
the
necessity
of
solidarity
in
the
efforts
to
pursue
the
turkish
cause
is
seen
by
the
victims
of
the
first
genocide
of
the
century
as
a
positive
step
now
