HE

HAS

STRETCHING
FROM
THE

TURANIST

THE

WHO

I
WOULD
SUGGEST
TURKEY
LET
THE

FEEL
SOME
OF
THEIR
GREY
WOLF
TEETH
AND
ATTEMPT
TO
STRETCH
FROM
THE
ADRIATIC
TO
CHINA
TURKEY
WILL
HAVE
CRIED
WOLF
JUST
ONCE
TOO
MUCH
MENTIONING
THAT
TURKIC
PEOPLE
ARE
WIDESPREAD
MEANS
DESIRING
A
TURKISH
EMPIRE
IS
THAT
THE
LOGICAL
THING
TO
CONCLUDE
FROM
A
STATEMENT
LIKE
THAT
TO
ME
IT
JUST
SAYS
THAT
TURKEY
MAY
HAVE
ECONOMICAL
BENEFITS
FROM
THAT
IF
SHE
CAN
BE
COMPETITIVE
ENOUGH
NO
MORE
THAN
THAT
BUT
OF
COURSE
YOU
HAVE
THE
FREEDOM
OF
EXTRAPOLATING
AS
YOU
WISH
FROM
ANY
STATEMENT
ONE
QUESTION
