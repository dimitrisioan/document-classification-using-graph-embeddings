HOW
DID
YOU
COME
TO
WRITE
THESE
TWO
BOOKS
ON
TURKEY
AND
EUROPEAN
AND
TURKISH
JEWS
SHAW
BASICALLY
IM
AN
OTTOMAN
HISTORIAN
BUT
IM
ALSO
JEWISH
IVE
SPENT
TWENTYFIVE
YEARS
STUDYING
OTTOMAN
HISTORY
AND
AS
TIME
WENT
ALONG
WHENEVER
I
FOUND
MATERIALS
ON
THE
OTTOMAN
JEWS
I
COLLECTED
THEM
BUT
I
NEVER
DID
ANYTHING
WITH
THEM
UNTIL
A
COUPLE
OF
YEARS
AGO
WHEN
I
SUDDENLY
REALIZED
THAT
WAS
THE
ANNIVERSARY
OF
THE
JEWS
BEING
EXPELLED
FROM
SPAIN
AND
COMING
TO
TURKEY
THEN
THE
SEPHARDIC
TEMPLE
DOWN
ON
WILSHIRE
AVENUE
INVITED
ME
TO
GIVE
A
SERIES
OF
THREE
LECTURES
ON
OTTOMAN
JEWRY
THESE
LECTURES
WERE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
AND
I
BECAME
MOTIVATED
TO
UNDERTAKE
FURTHER
RESEARCH
TO
DEVELOP
A
BOOK
THE
JEWS
OF
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
AND
THE
TURKISH
REPUBLIC
THIS
BOOK
IS
QUITE
DIFFERENT
FROM
THE
WORKS
OF
MOST
JEWISH
HISTORIANS
WHO
TEND
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
JEWS
IN
ANY
COUNTRY
MORE
FROM
THE
VIEWPOINT
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
THE
JEWISH
COMMUNITY
AND
RELY
MAINLY
ON
JEWISH
SOURCES
I
VIEW
MY
SUBJECT
AS
AN
OTTOMAN
HISTORIAN
AND
I
APPROACH
THE
JEWS
OF
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
LARGELY
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
OTTOMAN
SOCIETY
USING
LARGELY
OTTOMAN
SOURCES
AFTER
I
FINISHED
THIS
BOOK
AND
SENT
IT
TO
THE
PRESS
I
CAME
ACROSS
ADDITIONAL
DOCUMENTS
RELATING
TO
TURKISH
JEWS
DURING
WORLD
WAR
II
IN
THE
COMPLETED
BOOK
I
HAD
SAID
THAT
TURKEY
HAD
DONE
A
GOOD
DEAL
TO
RESCUE
THE
JEWS
DURING
WORLD
WAR
II
BUT
I
DID
NOT
ACTUALLY
HAVE
MANY
DETAILS
THEN
I
FOUND
A
BATCH
OF
DOCUMENTS
IN
THE
FOREIGN
MINISTRY
ARCHIVE
RELATING
TO
ACTIONS
TAKEN
BY
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
TO
HELP
THE
JEWS
BEFORE
AND
DURING
THE
HOLOCAUST
IT
WAS
TOO
LATE
TO
ADD
THIS
NEW
INFORMATION
TO
THE
BOOK
IN
PRESS
SO
I
DECIDED
TO
WRITE
A
SECOND
BOOK
I
CONDUCTED
FURTHER
RESEARCH
MAINLY
IN
THE
ARCHIVES
OF
THE
FOREIGN
MINISTRY
IN
ANKARA
AND
THE
TURKISH
EMBASSY
AND
CONSULATE
IN
PARIS
THE
RESULT
WAS
THE
SECOND
BOOK
TURKEY
AND
THE
HOLOCAUST
WHICH
DETAILS
HOW
TURKEY
HELPED
RESCUE
JEWS
FROM
THE
NAZIS
HOW
EXACTLY
DID
THEY
DO
THIS
THE
STORY
TAKES
PLACE
OVER
A
NUMBER
OF
YEARS
THE
BOOK
PRESENTS
THE
MATERIAL
IN
THREE
PARTS
FIRST
OF
WHICH
DEALS
WITH
THE
PERIOD
BEFORE
THE
HOLOCAUST
WHEN
THE
NAZIS
CAME
TO
POWER
IN
GERMANY
IN
THEY
IMMEDIATELY
STARTED
DISMISSING
JEWS
AND
ANTINAZI
GERMANS
FROM
UNIVERSITIES
HOSPITALS
SCIENTIFIC
INSTITUTES
AND
THE
LIKE
TURKEY
AT
THAT
MOMENT
WAS
JUST
BEGINNING
THE
PROCESS
OF
REFORMING
ITS
UNIVERSITIES
AND
IT
SAW
IN
THESE
JEWS
WHO
WERE
BEING
FIRED
FROM
THEIR
POSITIONS
IN
GERMANY
A
GOOD
SOURCE
OF
NEW
TALENT
TO
HELP
MODERNIZE
THE
TURKISH
UNIVERSITIES
WITHIN
THREE
MONTHS
AFTER
THE
NAZIS
STARTED
DISMISSING
THESE
JEWS
TURKEY
ARRANGED
TO
TAKE
MANY
OF
THEM
IN
THEY
WERE
BROUGHT
TO
TURKEY
AND
WERE
GIVEN
APPOINTMENTS
AS
PROFESSORS
IN
THE
TURKISH
UNIVERSITIES
AS
HEADS
OF
SCIENTIFIC
INSTITUTES
AND
AS
MEDICAL
PERSONNEL
IN
HOSPITALS
ABOUT
TO
MAJOR
JEWISH
PROFESSORS
CAME
TO
TURKEY
IN
THE
ERNST
REUTER
A
GERMAN
POLITICAL
SCIENTIST
SPENT
THE
WAR
YEARS
TEACHING
POLITICAL
SCIENCE
IN
TURKEY
AFTER
WORLD
WAR
II
HE
WAS
MAYOR
OF
BERLIN
DURING
THE
BERLIN
AIRLIFT
FRITZ
NEIMARK
A
MAJOR
GERMAN
JEWISH
ECONOMIST
CAME
TO
TURKEY
AND
HELPED
ESTABLISH
A
MODERN
SCHOOL
OF
ECONOMICS
IN
ISTANBUL
A
MAN
NAMED
REICHENBACH
WHO
WAS
RESCUED
FROM
THE
NAZIS
BY
TURKEY
AND
SPENT
THE
WAR
YEARS
IN
TURKEY
EVENTUALLY
CAME
TO
UCLA
WHERE
HE
BECAME
A
PROFESSOR
OF
PHILOSOPHY
OTHER
GERMAN
JEWISH
EMIGRES
ENGAGED
IN
CULTURAL
ACTIVITIES
IN
TURKEY
ONE
SUCH
WAS
KARL
EBERT
WHO
HAD
BEEN
A
LEADING
THEATRICAL
PRODUCER
IN
BERLIN
UNTIL
HE
WAS
EXPELLED
BY
THE
NAZIS
HE
WENT
TO
TURKEY
WHERE
HE
ORGANIZED
THE
TURKISH
NATIONAL
THEATER
AND
THE
TURKISH
NATIONAL
OPERA
COMPANY
IN
ANKARA
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
PAUL
HINDEMUTH
SO
THE
FIRST
SECTION
OF
THE
BOOK
COVERS
THIS
FIRST
PHASE
WHEN
JEWS
WERE
BEING
PERSECUTED
IN
GERMANY
AND
RESCUED
BY
TURKEY
ODDLY
ENOUGH
THE
GERMAN
EMIGRES
WHEN
THEY
WERE
IN
TURKEY
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
THINK
TOO
BADLY
OF
GERMANY
THEY
REGARDED
THEMSELVES
MORE
AS
GERMANS
THAN
JEWS
AND
THEY
DID
NOT
JOIN
IN
THE
ANTINAZI
ACTIVITIES
OF
THE
LOCAL
TURKISH
JEWISH
COMMUNITY
I
EVEN
FOUND
LETTERS
FROM
THE
NAZI
REPRESENTATIVES
TO
TURKEY
PRAISING
THESE
GERMAN
JEWISH
REFUGEES
FOR
THEIR
WORK
IN
PROMOTING
THE
IDEA
OF
GERMAN
CULTURE
EVEN
THOUGH
THESE
PEOPLE
HAD
BEEN
PERSECUTED
BY
THE
NAZIS
AND
RESCUED
BY
THE
TURKS
THEY
SHARED
THE
NAZIS
FEELINGS
OF
ARYAN
RACIAL
SUPERIORITY
OVER
THE
TURKS
THE
SECOND
PART
OF
THE
BOOK
DEALS
WITH
THE
HOLOCAUST
WHICH
BEGAN
IN
WHEN
THE
NAZIS
OCCUPIED
FRANCE
IN
EUROPE
AT
THAT
TIME
AND
ESPECIALLY
IN
FRANCE
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
TURKISH
JEWS
THEY
HAD
MIGRATED
TO
EUROPE
FOR
VARIOUS
REASONS
FROM
ABOUT
THE
TURN
OF
THE
CENTURY
ONWARD
MOST
OF
THEM
HAD
SETTLED
IN
EUROPE
DURING
THE
TURKISH
WAR
FOR
INDEPENDENCE
AFTER
WORLD
WAR
I
WHEN
GREECE
WAS
THREATENING
TO
OVERRUN
TURKEY
THE
GREEKS
HAD
PERSECUTED
THE
JEWS
THROUGHOUT
THE
NINETEENTH
CENTURY
AND
THE
JEWS
FEARED
WHAT
MIGHT
HAPPEN
TO
THEM
IF
THE
GREEKS
TOOK
OVER
IN
TURKEY
MANY
JEWS
FLED
TO
FRANCE
DURING
THE
AND
MANY
ALSO
ABANDONED
THEIR
TURKISH
CITIZENSHIP
AND
BECAME
FRENCH
CITIZENS
SUDDENLY
THE
NAZIS
INVADED
FRANCE
IN
AND
STARTED
INTRODUCING
ALL
SORTS
OF
ANTIJEWISH
LAWS
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
SOON
FOUND
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
WORTH
VERY
MUCH
TO
BE
A
FRENCH
JEW
BUT
THAT
IT
WAS
WORTH
A
LOT
TO
BE
A
TURKISH
JEW
HOW
SO
TURKEY
REMAINED
NEUTRAL
THROUGH
MOST
OF
WORLD
WAR
II
IT
RETAINED
ITS
EMBASSIES
AND
CONSULATES
IN
ALL
THE
NAZIOCCUPIED
COUNTRIES
UNTIL
IT
FINALLY
ENTERED
THE
WAR
ON
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
ALLIES
AT
THE
END
OF
DURING
THE
WAR
THEREFORE
TURKEY
WAS
IN
A
POSITION
TO
DEFEND
ITS
CITIZENS
AGAINST
ANTIJEWISH
MEASURES
AND
THE
ACTIONS
THAT
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
TOOK
FORM
THE
SECOND
CHAPTER
OF
THE
BOOK
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
WHO
WERE
STATIONED
IN
FRANCE
IN
PARTICULAR
INTERVENED
TO
PROTECT
JEWS
OF
TURKISH
CITIZENSHIP
FROM
THE
NAZIS
FOR
THOSE
TURKISH
JEWS
WHO
HAD
RETAINED
THEIR
TURKISH
CITIZENSHIP
THERE
WAS
GENERALLY
NO
PROBLEM
IF
THEY
WERE
ARRESTED
AND
SENT
TO
A
CONCENTRATION
CAMP
THE
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
WOULD
COMMUNICATE
WITH
THE
COMMANDERS
OF
THE
CAMP
AND
OTHER
OFFICIALS
AND
SAY
IN
EFFECT
THESE
PEOPLE
ARE
TURKISH
CITIZENS
YOU
CANT
DO
THIS
TO
THEM
AND
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
WOULD
BE
RELEASED
IF
THEIR
BUSINESSES
WERE
CONFISCATED
THE
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
WOULD
PROTEST
AND
THE
BUSINESSES
WOULD
BE
RESTORED
THE
NAZIS
IN
GENERAL
WANTED
TO
KEEP
THE
FRIENDSHIP
OF
TURKEY
THEY
HOPED
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
TURKEY
AS
A
GATEWAY
FOR
AN
INVASION
OF
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
AND
THEY
ALSO
WANTED
TO
OBTAIN
CHROMIUM
AND
MANGANESE
FROM
TURKEY
IN
ORDER
TO
KEEP
TURKISH
FRIENDSHIP
THEY
USUALLY
ACCEPTED
THESE
INTERVENTIONS
ON
BEHALF
OF
TURKISH
JEWS
THE
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
SOMETIMES
WENT
TO
THE
CONCENTRATION
CAMPS
TO
SECURE
THE
RELEASE
OF
TURKISH
JEWS
AT
TIMES
THEY
EVEN
BOARDED
TRAINS
HAULING
TURKISH
JEWS
TO
AUSCHWITZ
FOR
EXTERMINATION
AND
SUCCEEDED
IN
GETTING
THEM
OFF
THE
TRAIN
MOST
OF
THE
FOREIGN
JEWS
WERE
SENT
TO
A
CONCENTRATION
CAMP
AT
A
PLACE
CALLED
DRANCY
IN
PARIS
AND
THATS
WHERE
MOST
OF
THE
INTERCESSION
BY
TURKISH
CONSULS
TOOK
PLACE
THE
GREATER
PROBLEM
CAME
WITH
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
WHO
HAD
ABANDONED
THEIR
TURKISH
CITIZENSHIP
AND
HAD
BECOME
FRENCH
CITIZENS
THE
CONSULS
COULDNT
DECLARE
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
TURKISH
CITIZENS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
NOT
MY
BOOK
INCLUDES
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
JEWS
LINING
UP
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
TURKISH
CONSULATE
EITHER
TO
GET
PASSPORTS
TO
RETURN
TO
TURKEY
OR
TO
GET
A
RESTORATION
OF
THEIR
TURKISH
CITIZENSHIP
THIS
WAS
A
BUREAUCRATIC
MATTER
SO
PROCESSING
THE
APPLICATION
WOULD
TAKE
SOME
TIME
IN
THE
MEANTIME
IT
WAS
A
REAL
EMERGENCY
BECAUSE
THE
NAZIS
WOULD
ARREST
JEWS
ON
THE
STREETS
FOR
ALMOST
NOTHING
THE
NAZIS
WOULD
EVEN
ARREST
THEM
IF
THEY
HAD
RADIOS
OR
TELEPHONES
IN
THEIR
APARTMENTS
BECAUSE
RADIOS
AND
TELEPHONES
WERE
FORBIDDEN
TO
JEWS
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
THESE
FORMER
TURKISH
JEWS
THE
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
INVENTED
A
DOCUMENT
CALLED
GAYRI
MUNTAZEM
VATANDASH
OR
IRREGULAR
FELLOW
CITIZEN
THE
DOCUMENT
SAID
IN
EFFECT
THIS
PERSON
IS
A
FORMER
TURKISH
CITIZEN
WHO
HAS
APPLIED
FOR
THE
RESTORATION
OF
HIS
TURKISH
CITIZENSHIP
IN
THE
MEANTIME
WE
WOULD
APPRECIATE
IT
IF
YOU
WOULD
TREAT
HIM
AS
IF
HE
WERE
A
TURKISH
CITIZEN
THE
DIPLOMATS
WROTE
THE
DOCUMENT
IN
TURKISH
AND
PUT
THEIR
SEALS
ON
IT
SINCE
THE
NAZIS
COULD
NOT
READ
TURKISH
ON
THE
WHOLE
THEY
ACCEPTED
THESE
PAPERS
AS
CERTIFICATES
OF
CITIZENSHIP
BY
THIS
MEANS
THE
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
WERE
ABLE
TO
RESCUE
MANY
JEWS
WHO
HAD
RELINQUISHED
THEIR
TURKISH
CITIZENSHIP
ACTUALLY
THE
NAZIS
WERE
OF
TWO
MINDS
ABOUT
THE
TURKISH
DEFENSE
OF
JEWS
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
THE
NAZI
FOREIGN
MINISTRY
WHICH
WANTED
TO
RETAIN
THE
FRIENDSHIP
OF
TURKEY
WAS
IN
FAVOR
OF
ACCEPTING
THESE
INTERVENTIONS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
HIMMLER
AND
EICHMANN
WANTED
ALL
JEWS
EXTERMINATED
AT
TIMES
HIMMLER
AND
EICHMANN
WERE
ABLE
TO
PREVAIL
AND
SOME
OF
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
WERE
SENT
OFF
TO
AUSCHWITZ
BEFORE
THE
TURKISH
CONSULS
COULD
DO
ANYTHING
DO
YOU
HAVE
STATISTICS
ON
HOW
MANY
TURKISH
JEWS
WERE
RESCUED
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
TURKISH
JEWS
IN
EUROPE
BEFORE
WORLD
WAR
II
ABOUT
OF
WHOM
WERE
LIVING
IN
FRANCE
MOST
OF
THE
INFORMATION
IN
THIS
SECTION
OF
THE
BOOK
RELATES
TO
THE
SITUATION
IN
FRANCE
I
HAVE
PUBLISHED
THE
LETTERS
THAT
THE
TURKISH
CONSULS
SENT
TO
THE
NAZI
OFFICIALS
AND
THE
LETTERS
THAT
CAME
BACK
IN
REPLY
GENERALLY
THE
NAZIS
SAID
THAT
IF
THE
TURKISH
CONSUL
WOULD
PRESENT
DOCUMENTS
CERTIFYING
THAT
ARRESTED
INDIVIDUALS
ARE
TURKISH
CITIZENS
AND
PROMISE
TO
SEND
THEM
OUT
OF
FRANCE
THE
NAZIS
WOULD
RELEASE
THEM
FROM
THE
CONCENTRATION
CAMP
THE
TURKISH
CONSULS
ALSO
ORGANIZED
SPECIAL
TRAINS
TO
TAKE
TURKISH
JEWS
FROM
NAZIOCCUPIED
TERRITORY
BACK
TO
TURKEY
THESE
TRAINS
RAN
REGULARLY
IN
AND
THE
NAZIS
GAVE
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
VISAS
SO
THEY
COULD
PASS
OUT
OF
NAZI
TERRITORY
BUT
THE
TRAINS
WERE
OFTEN
HELD
UP
BY
THE
NAZIINFLUENCED
GOVERNMENTS
OF
EASTERN
EUROPE
CROATIA
SERBIA
AND
BULGARIA
BECAUSE
THESE
GOVERNMENTS
REALLY
DIDNT
WANT
THE
JEWS
TO
ESCAPE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
TURKISH
CONSULS
EFFORTS
ABOUT
TO
OF
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
IN
FRANCE
WERE
SAVED
ANOTHER
WERE
SENT
OFF
TO
AUSCHWITZ
WHERE
MOST
OF
THEM
DIED
THE
REMAINING
EITHER
ESCAPED
ACROSS
THE
BORDER
INTO
SPAIN
OR
FLED
TO
THE
AREA
OF
SOUTHERN
FRANCE
OCCUPIED
BY
THE
ITALIANS
WHO
TREATED
JEWS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
THE
NAZIS
DID
AT
THE
END
OF
HOWEVER
ITALY
FELL
OUT
OF
THE
WAR
AND
THAT
WAS
THE
END
FOR
THOSE
JEWS
AS
WELL
INCIDENTALLY
THE
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
IN

GREECE
ALSO
WORKED
TO

IN

TURKISH
ORIGIN
FROM
NAZI
PERSECUTION
YES
AND
THERE
IS
AN
ASIDE
I
MIGHT
ADD
HERE
IN
THEIR
INTERVENTIONS
ON
BEHALF
OF
TURKISH
JEWS
THE
TURKS
CITED
THEIR
TREATY
WITH
GERMANY
WHICH
STATED
THAT
TURKISH
CITIZENS
IN
GERMAN
TERRITORY
WOULD
BE
TREATED
THE
SAME
AS
GERMAN
CITIZENS
IN
TURKEY
ON
THAT
BASIS
THE
TURKS
MAINTAINED
THAT
THE
NAZIS
COULD
NOT
DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST
TURKISH
CITIZENS
WHO
ARE
JEWS
THE
NAZIS
CLAIMED
AND
THE
VICHY
GOVERNMENT
AGREED
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
DISCRIMINATING
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
TREATING
ALL
JEWS
EQUALLY
TURKEY
PROTESTED
SAYING
YOU
ARE
DIVIDING
OUR
CITIZENS
ACCORDING
TO
RELIGION
BUT
THE
TURKISH
CONSTITUTION
REQUIRES
THAT
ALL
CITIZENS
BE
TREATED
EQUALLY
REGARDLESS
OF
RELIGION
THEREFORE
YOU
CANNOT
SINGLE
OUT
TURKISH
JEWS
AMERICAN
CONSULS
IN
PARIS
BY
CONTRAST
ACCEPTED
THE
NAZI
ARGUMENT
AND
TOLD
AMERICAN
JEWS
WHO
WERE
BEING
PERSECUTED
BY
THE
NAZIS
THAT
THEY
COULDNT
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
BECAUSE
THE
AMERICAN
JEWS
WERE
BEING
TREATED
THE
SAME
AS
OTHER
JEWS
THE
THIRD
PART
OF
THE
BOOK
TAKES
PLACE
IN
TURKEY
WHICH
WAS
THE
PRINCIPAL
CENTER
DURING
THE
HOLOCAUST
FOR
ACTIVITIES
AIMED
AT
THE
RESCUE
OF
EASTERN
EUROPEAN
JEWS
THE
KWISH
AGENCY
AN
ORGANIZATION
ESTABLISHED
BY
JEWS
IN
PALESTINE
TO
HELP
RESETTLE
JEWS
TO
PALESTINE
SET
UP
AN
OFFICE
IN
ISTANBUL
IN
UNDER
THE
LEADERSHIP
OF
CHAIM
BARLAS
OTHER
JEWISH
ORGANIZATIONS
IN
PALESTINE
ESPECIALLY
THE
KIBBUTZES
ALSO
SENT
REPRESENTATIVES
TO
ISTANBUL
TO
SET
UP
HEADQUARTERS
THESE
GROUPS
FIRST
TRIED
TO
CONTACT
JEWS
IN
EASTERN
EUROPE
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
TODAY
WE
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
HOLOCAUST
BUT
AT
THAT
TIME
PEOPLE
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
THEY
DIDNT
IMAGINE
THE
NAZIS
COULD
DO
THE
THINGS
THEY
WERE
DOING
AND
SO
THE
FIRST
STEP
WAS
TO
GET
INFORMATION
AND
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
LET
THEM
USE
THE
TURKISH
MAILS
TO
SEND
LETTERS
TO
THEIR
RELATIVES
AND
FRIENDS
IN
EASTERN
EUROPE
THE
JEWISH
ORGANIZATIONS
FOUND
OUT
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
WHEN
THEY
RECEIVED
REPLIES
LATER
ON
WHEN
THE
NAZIS
BEGAN
TO
INTERCEPT
SUCH
LETTERS
THE
JEWS
RECEIVED
ASSISTANCE
ALSO
FROM
THE
VATICAN
NUNCIO
ANGELO
RONCALI
WHO
SERVED
AS
THE
VATICAN
REPRESENTATIVE
IN
ISTANBUL
FROM
TO
AND
LATER
BECAME
POPE
JOHN
XXIII
AS
THE
VATICAN
REPRESENTATIVE
DURING
THE
WAR
HE
USED
THE
FACILITIES
OF
THE
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
TO
SUPPLEMENT
WHAT
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
WAS
DOING
TO
ASSIST
JEWISH
AGENCIES
IN
CONTACTING
JEWS
IN
EASTERN
EUROPE
WITH
THE
COOPERATION
OF
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
THESE
AGENCIES
THEN
SENT
HARD
CURRENCY
FOOD
CLOTHING
AND
EVEN
RAILROAD
AND
STEAMSHIP
TICKETS
TO
JEWS
IN
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
BULGARIA
ROMANIA
AND
HUNGARY
THEY
WERENT
ABLE
TO
HELP
MUCH
IN
POLAND
BECAUSE
BY
THEN
THE
NAZIS
HAD
WIPED
OUT
ALMOST
ALL
THE
POLISH
JEWS
WHENEVER
POSSIBLE
THE
RESCUE
AGENCIES
ARRANGED
FOR
THE
JEWS
TO
GET
OUT
OF
EASTERN
EUROPE
EITHER
BY
TRAIN
THROUGH
THE
SO
CALLED
ORIENT
EXPRESS
ROUTE
TO
ISTANBUL
OR
BY
BOAT
THROUGH
THE
BLACK
SEA
TO
ISTANBUL
TURKEY
WAS
NOT
EAGER
FOR
ALL
THESE
REFUGEES
TO
REMAIN
WITHIN
ITS
BORDERS
DURING
THE
WAR
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
BEING
BLOCKADED
AND
WAS
SUFFERING
TERRIBLE
SHORTAGES
OF
FOOD
AND
CLOTHING
THE
GOVERNMENT
THEREFORE
FACILITATED
THE
MOVEMENT
OF
THE
NONTURKISH
JEWISH
REFUGEES
FROM
TURKEY
TO
PALESTINE
EITHER
BY
THE
TAURUS
EXPRESS
RAILROAD
THROUGH
THE
MOUNTAINS
TO
SYRIA
AND
PALESTINE
OR
BY
SMALL
BOATS
ACROSS
THE
EASTERN
MEDITERRANEAN
FROM
SOUTHERN
TURKEY
TO
PALESTINE
THESE
EFFORTS
WERE
BITTERLY
OPPOSED
NOT
ONLY
BY
THE
NAZIS
BUT
ALSO
BY
THE
BRITISH
WHO
DID
NOT
WANT
ANY
MORE
JEWISH
IMMIGRATION
TO
PALESTINE
BECAUSE
THEY
FEARED
IT
WOULD
HURT
THEIR
RELATIONS
WITH
THE
ARABS
THE
BRITISH
CONSTANTLY
PRESSURED
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
TO
STOP
THIS
TRAFFIC
AND
SEND
THOSE
JEWS
BACK
IN
A
FEW
CASES
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
YIELDING
TO
BRITISH
PRESSURE
DID
SEND
THE
BOATS
BACK
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
ONE
INCIDENT
THE
STEAMSHIP
STRUMA
WITH
SOME
JEWISH
REFUGEES
FROM
ROMANIA
WAS
SENT
BACK
BY
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
INTERVENTION
OF
THE
BRITISH
AMBASSADOR
WHEN
THAT
SHIP
WAS
SUNK
BY
A
SOVIET
SUBMARINE
ALL
WERE
LOST
EXCEPT
ONE
PERSON
NEVERTHELESS
ALL
TOLD
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
ALLOWED
NO
FEWER
THAN
EASTERN
EUROPEAN
JEWS
TO
PASS
THROUGH
TURKISH
TERRITORY
AND
MOVE
ON
TO
PALESTINE
DURING
THE
SECOND
WORLD
WAR
THE
TURKISH
AUTHORITIES
ALSO
PROVIDED
THESE
REFUGEES
WITH
FACILITIES
AND
MONEY
AND
GAVE
THEM
PERMISSION
TO
SEND
MONEY
AND
FOOD
OUT
OF
THE
COUNTRY
MANY
OF
THESE
JEWS
WHO
PASSED
THROUGH
TURKEY
MAY
STILL
BE
LIVING
IN
ISRAEL
YES
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
BUT
LETS
RETURN
FOR
A
MOMENT
TO
THE
FIRST
GROUP
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
WHO
CAME
FROM
EUROPE
THEY
DID
NOT
GO
ON
TO
PALESTINE
THEY
STAYED
IN
TURKEY
IT
WAS
THE
NONTURKISH
EASTERN
EUROPEAN
JEWS
WHO
PASSED
THROUGH
TURKEY
EN
ROUTE
TO
PALESTINE
THEIR
STORY
IS
VERY
INTERESTING
AND
YOU
HAVE
RESCUED
IT
FROM
OBSCURITY
MANY
STUDIES
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
OF
THE
HOLOCAUST
BUT
MOST
OF
THEM
DO
NOT
FOCUS
ON
THE
EASTERN
EUROPEAN
OR
MIDDLE
EASTERN
JEWS
MOST
OF
THE
SCHOLARSHIP
HAS
CENTERED
ON
THE
WESTERN
EUROPEAN
JEWS
OF
WHOM
MILLION
WERE
MASSACRED
BY
THE
NAZIS
MY
STUDY
DEALS
WITH
A
MUCH
SMALLER
NUMBER
OF
PEOPLE
I
HAVE
TRIED
TO
ROUND
OUT
THE
PICTURE
AND
I
HOPE
MY
BOOK
WILL
PERSUADE
OTHER
SCHOLARS
TO
UNDERTAKE
FURTHER
INVESTIGATIONS
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
EASTERN
JEWS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
NUMBERS
THE
GERMAN
JEWS
WERE
ALSO
RELATIVELY
SMALL
IN
NUMBER
MOST
OF
THE
MILLIONS
SLAIN
WERE
POLISH
JEWS
THE
RESCUE
OF
EASTERN
EUROPEAN
JEWS
MAY
NOT
SEEM
SO
SIGNIFICANT
COMPARED
WITH
THE
TOTAL
OF
MILLION
WHO
WERE
MURDERED
BUT
IT
MEANT
A
LOT
TO
THOSE
WHO
WERE
SAVED
ABOUT
THREEFOURTHS
OF
THE
BOOK
CONSISTS
OF
DOCUMENTS
TRANSLATIONS
OF
MANY
DOCUMENTS
THEY
ARE
INCLUDED
BECAUSE
THE
STORY
IS
NOT
WELL
KNOWN
NOT
ONLY
ARE
PEOPLE
IN
THE
WEST
UNAWARE
OF
THE
COURAGEOUS
ACTIONS
OF
THE
TURKISH
DIPLOMATS
EVEN
THE
PEOPLE
OF
TURKEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
THE
STORY
I
FELT
THAT
THEY
WOULD
NOT
FULLY
UNDERSTAND
THIS
REMARKABLE
ACHIEVEMENT
UNLESS
THEY
COULD
SEE
THE
DOCUMENTS
WHAT
LANGUAGES
ARE
USED
IN
THE
DOCUMENTS
MOST
OF
THEM
ARE
IN
TURKISH
OR
FRENCH
SOME
ARE
IN
HEBREW
THERE
IS
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
MATERIAL
IN
HEBREW
ABOUT
THE
ORGANIZATION
OF
THE
BOATS
GOING
TO
PALESTINE
THE
PASSENGERS
AND
SO
ON
BUT
I
DID
NOT
GO
INTO
THOSE
DETAILS
EXTENSIVELY
I
DESCRIBE
MOSTLY
WHAT
TURKEY
DID
SO
MOST
OF
MY
DOCUMENTS
ARE
IN
TURKISH
OR
FRENCH
A
FEW
DOCUMENTS
ARE
IN
ENGLISH
THE
JEWISH
GROUPS
IN
ISTANBUL
DID
NOT
NECESSARILY
COOPERATE
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
TO
RESCUE
JEWS
IN
FACT
THEY
OFTEN
FOUGHT
WITH
ONE
ANOTHER
THEY
TOOK
TURNS
TRYING
TO
GET
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
TO
DEPORT
RIVAL
GROUPS
FOR
EXAMPLE
SOME
OF
THE
KIBBUTZ
GROUPS
FELT
THAT
THE
JEWISH
AGENCY
WAS
RUN
BY
WESTERN
EUROPEAN
JEWS
WHO
WERE
INTERESTED
ONLY
IN
HELPING
WESTERN
EUROPEAN
JEWS
FINALLY
IN
PRESIDENT
ROOSEVELT
SENT
A
PERSONAL
REPRESENTATIVE
IRA
HIRSCHMAN
WHO
HAD
BEEN
AN
EXECUTIVE
OF
BLOOMINGDALES
DEPARTMENT
STORE
IN
NEW
YORK
CITY
AND
HIRSCHMAN
MANAGED
TO
RECONCILE
THEIR
DIFFERENCES
THE
DOCUMENTS
RELATED
TO
HIS
MISSION
ARE
IN
ENGLISH
I
ALSO
OBTAINED
MANY
DOCUMENTS
FROM
SERGE
KLARSFELD
A
HOLOCAUST
HISTORIAN
IN
FRANCE
WHO
MAINLY
WORKED
ON
THE
FRENCH
JEWS
HIS
FATHER
WAS
KILLED
BY
THE
NAZIS
HE
GAVE
ME
MATERIALS
HE
HAD
GATHERED
IN
THE
GERMAN
ARCHIVES
ON
THE
TURKISH
JEWS
SO
I
DIDNT
PERSONALLY
CONSULT
THE
GERMAN
ARCHIVES
I
BELIEVE
THAT
MUCH
MORE
CAN
BE
LEARNED
FROM
THE
GERMAN
ARCHIVES
AND
I
HOPE
SOMEONE
SOMEDAY
WILL
MAKE
THE
EFFORT
THIS
NEW
BOOK
FITS
IN
WELL
WITH
YOUR
TEACHING
DOESNT
IT
RIGHT
