an
array
of
representatives
of
greek
political
parties
including
the
ruling
pasok
party
and
a
host
of
political
groups
both
armenian
and
nonarmenian
joined
to
voice
their
solidarity
with
the
armenian
people
in
their
pursuit
of
their
cause
and
activities
of
a
new
armenian
political
force
were
voiced
here
on
sunday
april
during
the
international
meeting
of
solidarity
with
the
armenian
people
and
judging
from
encouraging
messages
offered
by
the
representatives
of
these
political
groups
and
organizations
at
least
here
in
greece
the
armenian
cause
enjoys
abundant
support
from
a
wide
spectrum
of
the
political
world
the
international
meeting
of
solidarity
was
sponsored
by
the
greek
branch
of
the
armenian
popular
movement
a
comparatively
new
political
force
headed
by
younger
generations
of
armenians
who
openly
profess
their
support
of
the
armed
struggle
and
of
the
armenian
secret
army
for
the
liberation
of
armenia
asala
the
organization
has
branches
in
various
european
and
middle
eastern
countries
and
the
united
states
although
some
of
these
branches
appear
to
have
gone
through
a
switch
of
loyalties
because
of
the
split
within
the
ranks
of
asala
voicing
the
support
of
pasok
the
ruling
party
in
greece
to
the
armenian
people
was
mr
charalambidi
michalis
a
member
of
the
central
committee
of
the
party
and
the
greek
member
of
the
permanent
peoples
tribunal
explaining
the
goals
and
aspirations
of
the
armenian
popular
movement
was
ara
sarkisian
significant
was
the
address
delivered
by
mr
bassam
abusalim
on
behalf
of
the
popular
front
for
the
movements
continued
support
of
the
armenians
armed
struggle
in
their
pursuit
of
their
cause
pledging
that
palestinian
operated
and
run
training
camps
would
always
be
open
to
armenian
youth
who
need
training
for
such
a
struggle
later
mr
abusalim
answering
a
question
put
to
him
by
this
writer
affirmed
that
his
organization
had
always
trained
armenian
members
of
asala
and
that
this
policy
will
continue
the
doors
of
our
camps
are
always
open
to
armenian
freedom
fighters
he
affirmed
among
the
prominent
greek
politicians
who
attended
the
conference
was
the
son
of
prime
minister
papandreou
who
himself
holds
a
post
in
the
greek
cabinet
two
members
of
the
cypriot
parliament
who
had
journeyed
to
athens
for
the
specific
purpose
of
attending
the
international
gathering

democratic
party
edik

two
wings
of
the

representatives
of
an

a
number
of
mayors
of
greek
towns
and
cities
two
greek
members
of
the
european
parliament
and
other
members
of
the
greek
parliament
were
also
among
those
who
participated
in
the
international
conference
also
on
hand
to
follow
the
deliberations
was
the
ambassador
of
bulgaria
in
athens
more
than
significant
was
the
large
number
of
messages
received
by
the
organizers
including
the
following
palestinian
national
revolutionary
movement
fatah
popular
front
for
the

arab
socialist
labor
party
the
kurdistan
democratic
union
of
iraq
and
numerous
other
international
groups
all
noted
for
their
radical
stand
in
the
israeli
palestinian
conflict
support
from
arfrm
among
messages
received
from
armenian
groups
was
the
armenian
revolutionary
federationrevolutionary
movement
the
group
that
has
claimed
the
abduction
and
assassination
of
key
party
leaders
in
lebanon
accused
of
selling
out
to
foreign
interests
and
powers
the
message
clearly
gave
its
support
to
the
armenian
popular
movement
pledging
that
the
revolutionary
movement
will
continue
to
reveal
the
realities
no
matter
how
bitter
or
tragic
they
are
to
expose
the
antiarmenian
activities
of
the
leaders
of
the
dashnag
bureau
the
message
was
taken
as
an
indication
of
the
link
loose
as
it
may
be
that
exists
between
the
dissident
dashnag
group
and
the
armenian
popular
movement
open
supporters
of
asala
and
armed
struggle
the
armenian
popular
movement
has
set
up
its
headquarters
in
a
suburb
of
the
greek
capital
known
as
neos
kosmos
where
there
is
a
large
armenian
presence
the
headquarters
are
located
in
a
twostory
building
which
appears
to
have
turned
into
a
beehive
of
activity
on
the
part
of
scores
of
armenian
youth
who
prefer
to
give
their
first
names
only
when
invited
to

some
pretty
well

theories
as
usual
and
i
am
ready
to
send
the
copies
of
the
necessary
pages
to
anybody
who
wants

are
you
claiming
that
there
cant
be
such
a
reference
by
saying
it
is
not
possible
if
not
what
is
your
point
differences
in
the
number
of
pages
mine
was
published
in
argics
was
in
no
need
to
use
the
same
book
size
and
the
same
letter
charachter
in
both
publicationsetc
etc
does
it
give
you
an
idea
the
issue
was
not
the
number
of
pages
the
book
hasor
the
year
first
published
and
you
tried
to
hide
the
whole
point
the
point
is
that
both
books
have
the
exactly
the
same
quotes
about
how
moslems
are
killed
torturedetc
by
armeniansand
those
quotes
given
by
serdar
argic
exist
it
was
the
issue
wasntit
you
were
not
able
to
object
itdoes
it
bother
you
anyway
you
name
all
these
tortures
and
murders
by
armenians
as
a
crap
people
who
think
like
you
are
among
the
main
reasons
why
the
world
still
has
so
many
craps
in
the
any
question
serdar
argic
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
