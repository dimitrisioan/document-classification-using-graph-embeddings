anybody
know
how
many
jews
arabs
christians
and
others
have
died
in
terrorist
attacks
and
wars
over
these
years
due
to
arab
rhetoric
and
rejectionism
the
number
is
probably
close
to
at
least
all
these
lives
wasted
because
the
arabs
did
not
accept
the
partition
plan
in
well
over
in
lebanon
alone
in
the
iraniraq
conflict
even
if
iranians
arent
arabs
strictly
speaking
they
seem
to
hate
the
zionists
at

as
much
as
anyone
else
in
the
neighborhood
is
there
some
correlation
perhaps
between
hating
israel
and
killing
off
your
own
people
