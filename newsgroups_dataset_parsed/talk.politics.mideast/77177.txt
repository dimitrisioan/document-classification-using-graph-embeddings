WRITES
HEAP
SIMILARLY
MALAYSIA
WAS
FOUNDED
ON
THE
ORIGINAL
SINS
OF
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
AXIS
AND
ANTICHINESE
RACISM
ON
THE
PART
OF
INTELLECTUALS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
HERITAGE
OF
ENLIGHTENMENT
THIS
IS
REALLY
A
STRANGE
TARGET
FOR
MARTILLO
MALAYSIA
HAS
FULLY
VINDICATED
ITSELF
SINCE
IT
SHED
ITS
COLONIAL
YOKE
IT
IS
A
LEGITIMATE
ECONOMIC
SUCCESS
STORY
ITS
SUCCESS
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
DRAMATIC
AS
JAPAN
AND
SINGAPORE
NEVERTHELESS
IT
HAS
FULLY
VINDICATED
ITSELF
SO
ADVOCATING
ANGLOCOLONIALISM
IS
LUDICROUS
FOR
MALAYSIA
NEXT
I
SUPPOSE
YOU
WILL
BE
ADVOCATING
RECOLONIZATION
OF
CHINA
WHICH
IS
PROBABLY
EXPERIENCING
ONE
THE
GREATEST
SUSTAINED
ECONOMIC
BOOMS
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
MANKIND
DO
YOU
THINK
PRESENT
DAY
ENGLAND
IS
IN
A
POSITION
TO
SET
THE
STAGE
FOR
ANY
MORE
COLONIZATION
THEY
WILL
BE
LUCKY
IF
THEY
CAN
KEEP
INTACT
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
WITH
US
ASSISTANCE
AND
PROPER
AGREEMENTS
REDEPLOYMENT
OF
THE
BRITISH
AND
FRENCH
COLONIAL
EMPIRES
WOULD
NOT
BE
HARD
PRIMITIVE
WORLD
ELITES
WHO
RESIST
AND
WHO
INCITE
RESISTANCE
AMONG
THEIR
DELUDED
BRAINWASHED
AND
ESSENTIALLY
ENSLAVED
POPULATIONS
WOULD
GET
THE
IRAQ
TREATMENT
DREAM
ON
THEY
ARE
HAVING
PROBLEMS
EVEN
WITH
DEPLOYING
GROUND
TROOPS
IN
BOSNIA
PUBLIC
OPINION
DICTATES
THAT
LOSS
OF
LIVES
EVEN
IN
MINISCULE
QUANTITIES
CANNOT
BE
TOLERATED
IN
THE
RICH
COUNTRIES
THIS
IS
REALLY
WIERD
IF
YOU
COME
TO
THINK
OF
IT
THE
ARMED
FORCES
ARE
PAID
TO
BASICALLY
TO
ACCEPT
THE
RISK
OF
DYING
IF
THAT
DANGER
IS
REMOVED
IT
THEN
HAS
TO
BE
VIEWED
AS
WELFARE
ON
A
GRAND
SCALE
BUT
THAT
IS
EXACTLY
WHAT
THE
PUBLIC
IS
SAYING
THE
IRAQI
OPERATION
LEAD
TO
AN
EXTRAORDINARY
LOW
LEVEL
OF
CASUALTIES
THIS
IS
AN
ANOMALY
A
COMBINATION
OF
IRAQI
INCOMPETENCE
AND
DESERT
TERRAIN
ANY
FUTURE
OPERATION
WOULD
LEAD
TO
MORE
CASUALTIES
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
BOMBING
IN
BEIRUT
LEAD
TO
MORE
GI
DEATHS
THAN
THE
WHOLE
OF
DESERT
STORM
DO
YOU
REALLY
THINK
THAT
SCUM
LIKE
NEHRU
EVER
ASKED
THEMSELVES
WHETHER
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
INDIANS
WOULD
BE
BETTER
OFF
UNDER
BRITISH
OR
LOCAL
RULE
NEHRU
WAS
DRIVEN
BY
A
CRUDE
DESIRE
FOR
POWER
NATIONALISM
WAS
JUST
THE
VEHICLE
WHEREBY
INDIAN
NATIONALISTS
PERSUADED
A
LOT
OF
POOR
DELUDED
FOOLS
TO
DIE
IN
ORDER
TO
GIVE
A
SMALL
ELITE
THE
POWER
TO
EXPLOIT
OTHER
INDIANS
YOU
OBVIOUSLY
HAVE
SOME
INFORMATION
THAT
THE
REST
OF
US
ARE
NOT
AWARE
OF
OTHERWISE
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DRAW
SUCH
OUTRAGEOUS
CONCLUSIONS

THATS
COOL
I
WISH
EVERYONE
HAD
THE
SMAE
KIND
OF

THE
WORLD
WOULD
CERTAINLY
BE
A
BETTER
PLACE
