ME
CLEARIFY
MR
TURKISH
HENRIKARMENIA

NOT

ITCHY
SHE
IS
SIMPLY
LETTING
THE
WORLD
HENRIK
KNOW
THAT
SHE
WILL
NO
LONGER
SIT
THERE
QUIET
AND
LET
TURKS
GET
HENRIK
AWAY
WITH
THEIR
FAMOUS
TRICKS
ARMENIANS
DO
REMEMBER
OF
THE
TURKISH
HENRIK
INVASION
OF
THE
GREEK
ISLAND
OF
CYPRESS
WHILE
THE
WORLD
SIMPLY
WATCHED
ESIN
TERZIOGLU
YOUR
IGNORANCE
IS
OBVIOUS
FROM
YOUR
POSTING
ESIN
TERZIOGLU
CYPRUS
WAS
AN
INDEPENDENT
COUNTRY
WITH
TURKISHGREEK
INHABITANTS
NOT
A
GREEK
ISLAND
LIKE
YOUR
IGNORANT
POSTING

NEXT

READ
AND
LEARN
BEFORE
YOU
POST
ASIDE
FROM
SPELLING
WHY
IS
THAT
YOU
TURKS
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
ADMIT
YOUR
PAST
MISTAKES
YOU
KNOW
TURKISH
INVASION
OF
CYPRUS
WAS
A
MISTAKE
AND
TOO
BAD
THAT
UN
DID
NOT
DO
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
YOU
MAY
ASK
MISTAKE
YES
I
WOULD
SAY
WHY
IS
THAT
THE
GREEKS
DID
NOT
INVADE
CYPRUS
MY
RESPONSE
TO
THE
SHOOTING
DOWN
OF
A
TURKISH
AIRPLANE
OVER
THE
ARMENIAN
AIR
SPACE
WAS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
IGNORANT
POSTING
OF
THE
PERSON
FROM
YOUR
COUNTRY
TURKS
AND
AZERIS
CONSISTANTLY
WANT
TO
DRAG
ARMENIA
INTO
THE
KARABAKH
CONFLICT
WITH
AZERBAIJAN
THE
KARABAKHIARMENIANS
WHO
HAVE
LIVED
IN
THEIR
HOMELAND
FOR
YEARS
CUT
OFF
FROM
ARMENIA
AND
GIVEN
TO
AZERIS
BY
STALIN
ARE
THE
ONES
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CONFLICT
THEY
ARE
DEFENDING
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
AZERI
AGGRESSION
AGRESSION
THAT
HAS
NO
MERCY
FOR
INOCENT
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
COSTANTLY
SHELLED
WITH
AND
OTHE
RUSSIAN
AIRCRAFT
AT
LAST
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
US
INSISTS
THAT
TURKEY
STAY
OUT
OF
THE
KARABAKH
CRISIS
SO
THAT
THE
REPEAT
OF
THE
CYPRUS
INVASION
WILL
NEVER
OCCUR
AGAIN
