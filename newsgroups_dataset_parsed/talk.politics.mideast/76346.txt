REJOINDER
QUESTIONS
TO
ISRAELIS
DEAR
JOSH
I
APPRECIATE
THE
FACT
THAT
YOU
SOUGHT
TO
ANSWER
MY
QUESTIONS
HAVING
SAID
THAT
I
AM
NOT
TOTALLY
HAPPY
WITH
YOUR
ANSWERS
YOU
DID
NOT
FULLY
ANSWER
MY
QUESTION
WHETHER
ISRAELI
ID
CARDS
IDENTIFY
THE
HOLDERS
AS
JEWS
OR
ARABS
YOU
IMPLY
THAT
US
CITIZENS
MUST
IDENTIFY
THEMSELVES
BY
RACE
IS
THAT
TRUE
OR
ARE
JUST
TRYING
TO
MISLEAD
THE
READER
DO
YOU
KNOW
OF
ANY
DEMOCRATIC
COUNTRY
WHERE
PEOPLE
ARE
ASKED
TO
REVEAL
THEIR
ETHNICAL
OR
RELIGIOUS
IDENTITY
TO
ANY
PUBLIC
OFFICIAL
WHO
SO
REQUESTS
THE
ANSWER
TO
THE
SECOND
QUESTION
IS
EVASIVE
THERE
ARE
ALL
KINDS
OF
MAPS
ISSUED
THEY
ARE
NOT
EQUIVALENT
TO
STATE
POLICY
YOU
DID
NOT
RESPOND
TO
MY
QUESTION
YOUR
ANSWER
TO
THE
THIRD
QUESTION
ISRAELI
NUCLEAR
ARSENAL
IS
INTERESTING
YOU
SAY
THAT
ISRAELI
PROBABLY
STOCKS
NUCLEAR
WEAPONS
WHAT
EVIDENCE
HAVE
YOU
FOR
MAINTAINING
THAT
MY
FOURTH
QUESTION
WAS
ANSWERED
BY
SOMEONE
ELSE
WHO
POSTED
A
MAARIV
ARTICLE
DOCUMENTING
SUCH
CASES
I
DID
NOT
ASK
ABOUT
CASES
LIKE
VANUNU
EVERYBODY
KNEW
HE
WAS
TRIED
AND
IMPRISONED
BUT
ABOUT
THOSE
ABOUT
WHOM
NOBODY
EVEN
KNOWS
THAT
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
TRIED
AND
IMPRISONED
THANKS
FOR
CLARIFYING
THE
QUESTION
CONCERNING
THE
LEGAL
STATUS
OF
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
FROM
IT
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THERE
ARE
TWO
SETS
OF
LAWS
IN
THESE
ARES
ONE
FOR
THE
OCCUPIER
CIVIL
LAW
AND
ONE
FOR
THE
OCCUPIED
MILITARY
LAW
THE
LAW
ALLOWS
ISRAELI
ARABS
TO
SETTLE
IN
HEBRON
IT
SEEMS
IF
SO
WHY
DOESNT
IT
ALLOW
HEBRON
ARABS
TO
SETTLE
IN
ISRAEL
YOUR
ANSWER
TO
THE
QUESTION
CONCERNING
RIGHTS
TO
RETURN
CONFLICTS
WITH
WHAT
I
WAS
TOLD
NAMELY
THAT
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
NONJEWS
WHO
LEFT
FOR
SOME
REASON
OR
OTHER
THE
AREA
UNDER
ISRAEL
CONTROL
DURING
THE
WAR
OF
WERE
PREVENTED
FROM
RETURNING
FOR
THE
SOLE
REASON
THEY
WERE
NOT
JEWS
JEWS
WHO
ALSO
LEFT
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
EUROPE
TO
AVOID
THE
CLASHES
WERE
ALLOWED
TO
RETURN
HOW
CAN
YOU
JUSTIFY
SUCH
DISCRIMINATION
IF
THIS
IS
TRUE
IS
THE
MERE
FACT
OF
A
PERSON
LEAVING
AREA
OF
COMBAT
TO
SEEK
REFUGE
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
A
REASON
FOR
STRIPPING
HIM
OF
HIS
RIGHT
TO
LIVE
IN
HIS
HOMELAND
SOMEBODY
ANSWERED
MY
REGARDING
Y
RABIN
SIGNING
AN
ORDER
FOR
ETHNICAL
CLEANSING
IN
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
INFORMATION
Y
RABIN
SIGNED
THE
ORDER
FOR
THE
EXPULSION
OF
ALL
INHABITANTS
OF
LYDDA
AND
RAMLEH
ABOUT
PEOPLE
THESE
EXPULSIONS
WERE
HELPED
BY
MASSACRES
OF
CIVILIANS
AND
OTHER
ATROCITIES
WHICH
REMIND
BOSNIA
I
WAS
REFERRED
TO
A
BOOK
BY
ISRAELI
JOURNALIST
BENNY
GOODMAN
CALLED
THE
ORIGIN
OF
THE
PALESTINIAN
REFUGEE
PROBLEM
PUBLISHED
BY
CAMBRIDGE
UNIVERSITY
PRESS
IS
THIS
BOOK
AVAILABLE
IN
YOUR
LIBRARY
YOU
MAINTAIN
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
ISRAELI
ARABS
LIVING
IN
ISRAELI
KIBBUTZIM
I
WONDER
HOW
MANY
AND
WHERE
THERE
IS
VERY
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
AVAILABLE
ABOUT
THAT
AS
MUCH
AS
I
KNOW
MANY
ARABS
ARE
WORKING
FOR
KIBBUTZIM
EVEN
FOR
MANY
YEARS
BUT
ARE
NOT
ACCEPTED
AS
MEMBERS
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
KIBBUTZIM
DO
NOT
WANT
ARABS
MY
QUESTION
ABOUT
THE
LACK
OF
CIVIL
MARRIAGE
IN
ISRAEL
WAS
WHETHER
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
THE
ISRAELI
LEGISLATOR
INTENDED
TO
DISCOURAGE
INTERMARRIAGE
YOU
DID
NOT
ADDRESS
THIS
QUESTION
BUT
EVADED
IT
BY
SAYING
THAT
THE
ENTIRE
RELIGIOUS
ESTABLISHMENT
WANTS
TO
KEEP
IT
WHAT
WAY
I
AM
CERTAIN
THAT
IF
ONLY
RELIGIOUS
COMMUNITIES
IN
THE
US
WOULD
BE
ASKED
THEY
WOULD
GLADLY
ABOLISH
CIVIL
MARRIAGE
SO
THAT
PEOPLE
WOULD
DEPEND
UPON
RABBIS
AND
PRIESTS
TO
OFFICIATE
MARRIAGES
BUT
ISRAEL
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
RULED
BY
A
SECULAR
MAJORITY
YOUR
ANSWER
IS
NOT
SATISFACTORY
I
WOULD
BE
GLAD
TO
HAVE
SOME
MORE
INPUT
FROM
YOU
AFTER
THESE
COMMENTS
