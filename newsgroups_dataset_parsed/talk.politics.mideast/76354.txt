israels
expansion
ii
andi
beyer
writes
im
not
ignorant
of
the
holocaust
and
know
more
about
nazi
germany
than
most
people
maybe
including
you
you
really
belong
to
the
of
ignorants
in
usa
who
dont
know
what
the
holocaust
shoa
should
be
the
real
word
was
first
you
write
in
messageid
date
sat
apr
gmt
i
think
the
israeli
press
might
be
a
tad
bit
biased
in
reporting
the
events
i
doubt
the
propaganda
machine
of
goering
and
later
as
somebody
informed
you
about
your
gross
mistake
you
write
in
messageid
date
sun
apr
gmt
first
let
me
correct
myself
in
that
it
was
goerbels
and
not
goering
airforce
who
ran
the
nazi
propaganda
machine
instead
of
joseph
goebbels
and
you
dare
to
say
that
you
know
more
about
nazi
germany
than
most
people
maybe
including
us
im
sure
you
learned
the
history
of
nazi
germany
and
austria
from
your
family
what
i
resent
is
ignorant
statements
that
call
people
names
when
they
disagree
with
your
position
opposing
the
atrocities
commited
by
the
israeli
governement
hardly
qualifies
as
antisemitism
if
you
think
name
calling
is
a
valid
form
of
argument
in
intellectual
circles
you
need
to
get
out
more
often
trying
to
make
comparisons
between
israels
politics
and
nazi
german
austrian
politics
shows
only
your
degree
of
ignorance
high
intellect
low
humanity
none
and
antisemitism
average
i
respect
anybody
who
dissagrees
with
me
as
long
as
he
respects
me
and
discusses
in
a
civilized
manner
i
would
never
say
that
anybody
that
critizises
israel
andor
its
politics
is
an
antisemite
except
he
uses
antisemitic
vocabularyterminologydemagogy
israel
is
not
a
perfect
country
and
its
politicians
also
commits
errors
even
some
of
them
are
corrupt
like
politicians
in
any
other
country
but
they
carry
a
huge
burden
to
care
for
the
safety
of
all
its
citizens
and
that
is
really
not
an
easy
task
in
a
country
that
is
surrounded
by
enemies
who
only
expect
that
israel
commits
the
one
big
error
and
wipe
the
country
and
its
jewish
citizens
plus
the
socalled
collaborators
arabs
that
wanted
to
live
in
peace
with
their
jewish
neighbours
of
the
map
as
i
said
israel
is
not
a
perfect
country
but
it
is
the
only
democracy
in
the
whole
middleeast
and
the
only
country
in
the
world
where
jews
from
everywhere
can
have
a
refuge
in
case
of
persecutions
in
the
countries
they
are
living
our
long
history
has
taught
us
that
we
cannot
rely
on
nonjewish
nations
and
its
governments
as
soon
as
there
are
more
or
les
big
socialeconomicalpolitical
problems
in
any
country
the
first
ones
that
pay
for
the
broken
glasses
are
the
jews
and
later
the
other
minorities
of
the
country
i
dont
think
the
suffering
of
some
jews
during
wwii
justifies
the
crimes
commited
by
the
israeli
government
any
attempt
to
call
civil
liberterians
like
myself
antisemetic
is
not
appreciated
this
is
really
outrageous
murdered
jews
besides
the
thousands
who
survived
the
shoa
in
some
way
or
another
and
the
rest
of
the
living
ones
mourning
for
all
of
them
i
dont
know
what
you
call
a
civil
libertarian
never
heard
about
them
but
i
know
only
one
thing
if
all
of
them
think
like
you
do
it
then
civil
libertarians
is
a
new
denomination
for
antisemites
may
other
civil
libertarians
come
to
word
to
this
group
so
that
we
can
learn
if
abeyer
and
me
are
right
that
civil
libertarians
are
antisemites
or
that
im
wrong
and
he
is
missusing
that
word
btw
i
couldnt
care
less
for
what
andi
beyer
appreciates
