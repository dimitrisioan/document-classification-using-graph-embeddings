re
armenia
says
it
could
shoot
down
turkish
planes
henrik
and
hilmi
writes
henrik
the
armenians
in
nagarnokarabagh
are
simply
defending
their
henrik
rights
to
keep
their
homeland
and
it
is
the
azeris
that
are
henrik
invading
their
homeland
he
homeland
first
nagarnokarabagh
was
armenians
homeland
today
he
fizuli
lacin
and
several
villages
in
azerbadjan
he
are
their
homeland
cant
you
see
the
he
the
great
armenia
dream
in
this
with
facist
methods
like
he
killing
raping
and
bombing
villages
the
last
move
was
the
he
blast
of
a
truck
with
kurdish
refugees
trying
to
he
escape
the
from
lacin
a
city
that
was
given
to
the
kurds
he
by
the
armenians
nagornokarabakh
is
in
azerbaijan
not
armenia
armenians
have
lived
in
nagorno
karabakh
ever
since
there
were
armenians
armenians
used
to
live
in
the
areas
between
armenia
and
nagornokarabakh
and
this
area
is
being
used
to
invade
nagorno
karabakh
armenians
are
defending
themselves
if
azeris
are
dying
because
of
a
policy
of
attacking
armenians
then
something
is
wrong
with
this
policy
attacking
who
is
attacking
who
even
the
country
you
live
inusa
have
condemned
armenia
for
its
attacking
and
you
start
to
say
that
the
attackers
are
the
azeris
armenians
have
lived
in
nagorno
karabakh
ever
since
there
were
armenians
azeris
have
lived
in
nagorno
karabakh
ever
since
there
were
azeris
dont
come
with
nonsence
there
is
no
reason
to
attack
a
people
just
because
a
man
called
gorbatjov
and
co
gave
the
freedom
to
the
people
in
this
area
if
i
recall
correctly
it
was
stalin
who
caused
all
this
problem
with
land
in
the
first
place
not
the
armenians
its
easy
for
people
like
you
to
blame
history
the
were
a
lot
of
indians
living
in
usa
there
is
no
reason
for
these
indians
to
attack
the
american
people
and
sayit
was
the
fault
of
the
government
of
germany
and
great
britain
because
they
made
people
come
to
our
place
armenians
lived
in
harmony
with
the
azeris
until
gorbatjov
and
co
gave
freedom
to
the
people
in
karabag
then
the
armenians
started
to
kill
rape
and
torture
the
azeris
not
only
in
karabag
but
also
noe
in
azerbadjan
henrik
however
i
hope
that
the
armenians
will
force
a
turkish
airplane
henrik
to
land
for
purposes
of
searching
for
arms
similar
to
the
one
henrik
that
happened
last
summer
turkey
searched
an
american
plane
henrik
carrying
humanitarian
aid
bound
to
armenia
he
dont
speak
about
things
you
dont
know
us
cargo
planes
he
were
heading
to
armenia
when
the
turkish
authorities
he
announced
that
they
were
going
to
search
these
cargo
he
planes
of
these
planes
returned
to
its
base
in
germany
he
of
these
planes
were
searched
in
turkey
the
content
of
he
of
the
other
planes
not
hard
to
guess
is
it
it
was
sure
not
he
humanitarian
aid
what
story
are
you
talking
about
planes
from
the
us
have
been
sending
aid
into
armenian
for
two
years
i
would
not
like
to
guess
about
what
were
in
the
planes
in
your
story
i
would
like
to
find
out
he
search
turkish
planes
you
dont
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
turkeys
government
has
announced
that
its
giving
weapons
he
to
azerbadjan
since
armenia
started
to
attack
azerbadjan
he
it
self
not
the
karabag
province
so
why
search
a
plane
for
weapons
he
since
its
content
is
announced
to
be
weapons
its
too
bad
you
would
want
turkey
to
start
a
war
with
armenia
thats
what
i
dont
want
you
couldnt
imagine
the
result
of
a
war
so
france
greece
and
usa
wants
to
start
fighting
with
azerbadjan
they
give
a
lot
more
weapons
to
the
armenians
without
saying
it
thats
no
secret
any
more
i
must
say
that
these
armenian
government
is
very
shortsighted
do
they
think
that
they
shall
move
from
its
neigbours
when
the
war
is
over
the
neighbour
around
will
be
there
and
armenia
must
live
in
harmony
with
these
if
they
dont
want
a
stoneage
country
for
thats
whats
will
happen
armenia
if
the
wars
continues
look
the
president
of
turkey
turgut
ozal
died
and
petrosyan
the
armenian
presindent
is
now
in
turkey
for
the
funeral
is
it
because
he
liked
him
sure
not
because
armenia
needs
its
neighbours
and
must
live
with
these
but
armenia
cant
stop
this
war
with
continued
ordertaking
from
states
like
france
and
usa
with
other
words
if
you
love
your
people
you
must
think
twice
and
i
wonder
shoot
down
turkish
planes
with
what
ohhh
i
forgot
the
armenians
cant
find
food
but
there
are
a
lot
of
arms
from
the
mentioned
countries
