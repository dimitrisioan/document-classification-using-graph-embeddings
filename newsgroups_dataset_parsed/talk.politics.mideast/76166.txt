WAY
OF

THE
HAMAS
WAY
OF
DEATH
FOLLOWING
IS
A
TRANSCRIPT
OF
A
RECRUITMENT
AND
TRAINING
VIDEOTAPE
MADE
LAST
SUMMER
BY
THE
QASSAM
BATTALIONS
THE
MILITARY
ARM
OF
HAMAS
AN
ISLAMIC
PALESTINIAN
GROUP
HAMAS
FIGURES
SIGNIFICANTLY
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
EQUATION
IN
DECEMBER
ISRAEL
DEPORTED
MORE
THAN
PALESTINIANS
TO
LEBANON
IN
RESPONSE
TO
HAMASS
KIDNAPPING
AND
EXECUTION
OF
AN
ISRAELI
SOLDIER
A
LONGER
VERSION
APPEARS
IN
THE
MAY
ISSUE
OF
HARPERS
MAGAZINE
WHICH
OBTAINED
AND
TRANSLATED
THE
TAPE
MY
NAME
IS
YASIR
HAMMAD
ALHASSAN
ALI
I
LIVE
IN
NUSEIRAT
A
REFUGEE
CAMP
IN
THE
GAZA
STRIP
I
WAS
BORN
IN
I
FINISHED
HIGH
SCHOOL
THEN
ATTENDED
GAZA
POLYTECHNIC
LATER
I
WENT
TO
WORK
FOR
ISLAMIC
UNIVERSITY
IN
GAZA
AS
A
CLERK
IM
MARRIED
AND
I
HAVE
TWO
DAUGHTERS
THE
QASSAM
BATTALIONS
ARE
THE
ONLY
GROUP
IN
PALESTINE
EXPLICITLY
DEDICATED
TO
JIHAD
HOLY
WAR
OUR
PRIMARY
CONCERN
IS
PALESTINIANS
WHO
COLLABORATE
WITH
THE
ENEMY
MANY
YOUNG
MEN
AND
WOMEN
HAVE
FALLEN
PREY
TO
THE
CUNNING
TRAPS
LAID
BY
THE
ISRAELI
SECURITY
SERVICES
SINCE
OUR
ENEMIES
ARE
TRYING
TO
OBLITERATE
OUR
NATION
COOPERATION
WITH
THEM
IS
CLEARLY
A
TERRIBLE
CRIME
OUR
MOST
IMPORTANT
OBJECTIVE
MUST
BE
TO
PUT
AN
END
TO
THE
PLAGUE
OF
COLLABORATION
TO
DO
SO
WE
ABDUCT
COLLABORATORS
INTIMIDATE
AND
INTERROGATE
THEM
IN
ORDER
TO
UNCOVER
OTHER
COLLABORATORS
AND
EXPOSE
THE
METHODS
THAT
THE
ENEMY
USES
TO
LURE
PALESTINIANS
INTO
COLLABORATION
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
IN
ADDITION
TO
THAT
NATURALLY
WE
CONFRONT
THE
PROBLEM
OF
COLLABORATORS
BY
EXECUTING
THEM
WE
DONT
EXECUTE
EVERY
COLLABORATOR
AFTER
ALL
ABOUT
PERCENT
OF
THEM
ARE
INNOCENT
VICTIMS
TRICKED
OR
BLACKMAILED
INTO
THEIR
MISDEEDS
THE
DECISION
WHETHER
TO
EXECUTE
A
COLLABORATOR
IS
BASED
ON
THE
SERIOUSNESS
OF
HIS
CRIMES
IF
LIKE
MANY
COLLABORATORS
HE
HAS
BEEN
RECRUITED
AS
AN
AGENT
OF
THE
ISRAELI
BORDER
GUARD
THEN
IT
IS
IMPERATIVE
THAT
HE
BE
EXECUTED
AT
ONCE
HES
AS
DANGEROUS
AS
AN
ISRAELI
SOLDIER
SO
WE
TREAT
HIM
LIKE
AN
ISRAELI
SOLDIER
THERES
ANOTHER
GROUP
OF
COLLABORATORS
WHO
PERFORM
AN
EVEN
MORE
LOATHSOME
ROLE
THE
ONES
WHO
HELP
THE
ENEMY
TRAP
YOUNG
MEN
AND
WOMEN
IN
BLACKMAIL
SCHEMES
THAT
FORCE
THEM
TO
BECOME
COLLABORATORS
I
REGARD
THE
ISQAT
THE
PROCESS
BY
WHICH
A
PALESTINIANS
IS
BLACKMAILED
INTO
COLLABORATION
OF
SINGLE
PERSON
AS
GREATER
CRIME
THAN
THE
KILLING
OF
A
DEMONSTRATOR
IF
SOMEONE
IS
GUILTY
OF
CAUSING
REPEATED
CASES
OF
ISQAT
THAN
IT
IS
OUR
RELIGIOUS
DUTY
TO
EXECUTE
HIM
A
THIRD
GROUP
OF
COLLABORATORS
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
NARCOTICS
THEY
WORK
ON
DIRECT
ORDERS
FROM
THE
SECURITY
SERVICES
TO
DISTRIBUTE
DRUGS
AS
WIDELY
AS
POSSIBLE
THEIR
VICTIMS
BECOME
ADDICTED
AND
SOON
FIND
IT
UNBEARABLE
TO
QUIT
AND
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
AFFORD
MORE
THEY
COLLABORATE
IN
ORDER
TO
GET
THE
DRUGS
THEY
CRAVE
THE
DEALERS
MUST
ALSO
BE
EXECUTED
IN
THE
BATTALIONS
WE
HAVE
DEVELOPED
A
VERY
CAREFUL
METHOD
OF
UNCOVERING
COLLABORATORS
WE
CANT
AFFORD
TO
ABDUCT
AN
INNOCENT
PERSON
BECAUSE
ONCE
WE
SEIZE
A
PERSON
HIS
REPUTATION
IS
TARNISHED
FOREVER
WE
WILL
ABDUCT
AND
INTERROGATE
A
COLLABORATOR
ONLY
AFTER
EVIDENCE
OF
HIS
GUILT
HAS
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
NEVER
BEFORE
IF
AFTER
INTERROGATION
THE
COLLABORATOR
IS
FOUND
GUILTY
BEYOND
ANY
DOUBT
THEN
HE
IS
EXECUTED
IN
MANY
CASES
WE
DONT
HAVE
TO
MAKE
OUR
EVIDENCE
AGAINST
COLLABORATORS
PUBLIC
BECAUSE
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
THEYRE
GUILTY
BUT
WHEN
THE
PUBLIC
ISNT
AWARE
THAT
A
CERTAIN
INDIVIDUAL
IS
A
COLLABORATOR
AND
WE
ACCUSE
HIM
PEOPLE
ARE
BOUND
TO
ASK
FOR
EVIDENCE
MANY
PEOPLE
WILL
PROCLAIM
HIS
INNOCENCE
SO
THERE
MUST
BE
IRREFUTABLE
PROOF
BEFORE
HE
IS
EXECUTED
THIS
PROOF
IS
USUALLY
OBTAINED
IN
THE
FORM
OF
A
CONFESSION
AT
FIRST
EVERY
COLLABORATOR
DENIES
HIS
CRIMES
SO
WE
START
OFF
BY
SHOWING
THE
COLLABORATOR
THE
TESTIMONY
AGAINST
HIM
WE
TELL
HIM
THAT
HE
STILL
HAS
A
CHANCE
TO
SERVE
HIS
PEOPLE
EVEN
IN
THE
LAST
MOMENT
OF
HIS
LIFE
BY
CONFESSING
AND
GIVING
US
THE
INFORMATION
WE
NEED
WE
SAY
THAT
WE
KNOW
HIS
REPENTANCE
IN
SINCERE
AND
THAT
HE
HAS
BEEN
A
VICTIM
THAT
KIND
OF
TALK
IS
CONVINCING
MOST
OF
THEM
CONFESS
AFTER
THAT
OTHERS
HOLD
OUT
IN
THOSE
CASES
WE
APPLY
PRESSURE
BOTH
PSYCHOLOGICAL
AND
PHYSICAL
THEN
THE
HOLDOUTS
CONFESS
AS
WELL
ONLY
ONE
COLLABORATOR
HAS
EVER
BEEN
EXECUTED
WITHOUT
AN
INTERROGATION
IN
THAT
CASE
THE
COLLABORATOR
HAD
BEEN
SEEN
WORKING
FOR
THE
BORDER
GUARD
SINCE
BEFORE
THE
INTIFADA
AND
HE
HIMSELF
CONFESSED
HIS
INVOLVEMENT
TO
A
FRIEND
WHO
DISCLOSED
THE
INFORMATION
TO
US
IN
ADDITION
THREE
MEMBERS
OF
HIS
NETWORK
OF
COLLABORATORS
TOLD
US
THAT
HE
HAD
CAUSED
THEIR
ISQAT
WITH
THIS
MUCH
EVIDENCE
THERE
WAS
NO
NEED
TO
INTERROGATE
HIM
BUT
WE
ARE
VERY
CAREFUL
TO
AVOID
WRONGFUL
EXECUTIONS
IN
EVERY
CASE
OUR
PRINCIPAL
IS
THE
SAME
THE
ACCUSED
SHOULD
BE
INTERROGATED
UNTIL
HE
HIMSELF
CONFESSES
HIS
CRIMES
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
WE
SAT
DOWN
AND
COMPLIED
A
LIST
OF
COLLABORATORS
TO
DECIDE
WHETHER
THERE
WERE
ANY
WHO
COULD
BE
EXECUTED
WITHOUT
INTERROGATION
AN
ALTHOUGH
WE
HAD
HUNDREDS
OF
NAMES
STILL
BECAUSE
OF
OUR
FEAR
OF
GOD
AND
OF
HELL
WE
COULD
NOT
MARK
ANY
OF
THESE
MEN
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
ONE
I
JUST
MENTIONED
FOR
EXECUTION
WHEN
WE
EXECUTE
A
COLLABORATOR
IN
PUBLIC
WE
USE
A
GUN
BUT
AFTER
WE
ABDUCT
AND
INTERROGATE
A
COLLABORATOR
WE
CANT
SHOOT
HIM
TO
DO
SO
MIGHT
GIVE
AWAY
OUR
LOCATIONS
THATS
WHY
COLLABORATORS
ARE
STRANGLED
SOMETIMES
WE
ASK
THE
COLLABORATOR
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
HOW
SHOULD
WE
EXECUTE
YOU
ONE
COLLABORATOR
TOLD
US
