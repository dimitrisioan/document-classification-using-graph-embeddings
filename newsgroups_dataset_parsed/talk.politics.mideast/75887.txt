imho
it
does
not
really
matter
who
started
any
individual
battle
within
the
arabsisreal
war
context
the
real
question
is
whowhat
started
the
war
does
anyone
have
any
doubts
it
was
the
creation
of
israel
on
arab
land
huh
a
war
was
started
when
several
armies
invaded
israel
vowing
to
drive
the
jews
into
the
sea
most
jews
wanted
to
live
in
peace
and
the
arabs
who
stayed
in
israel
were
granted
citizenship
it
depends
entirely
on
how
you
define
war
the
actual
fighting
largely
predates
the
arab
invasions
after
all
deir
yassin
happened
in
midapril
well
before
the
arab
invasion
as
i
have
said
elsewhere
lt
col
lorch
has
said
that
hagana
forces
were
fighting
well
before
the
arabs
invaded
as
in
months
before
as
for
jews
wanting
to
live
in
peace
that
to
is
entirely
arguable
i
think
it
is
easy
enough
to
show
that
the
labour
party
leadership
had
no
such
intention
at
all
as
for
the
arabs
who
stayed
dont
you
mean
those
who
were
not
expelled
even
some
of
those
who
did
stay
were
not
granted
citizenship
but
expelled
after
the
fighting
had
stopped
anyway
joseph
askew
how
do
you
define
war
do
seiges
and
constant
attacks
on
villiages
count
as
acts
of
war
or
is
that
only
when
the
jews
do
them
january
arab
liberation
army
attacks
kfar
szold
men
attack
kfar
etzion
miles
south
of
jerusalem
after
cutting
off
the
supply
lines
to
it
attacks
on
yehiam
western
galilee
and
kibbutz
tirat
tzvi
by
midmarch
the
jewish
settlements
in
the
negev
had
been
cut
off
from
land
links
with
the
rest
of
the
jewish
population
the
etzion
group
of
villiages
near
hebron
had
been
cut
off
while
members
of
a
convoy
trying
to
supply
yehiam
were
slaughtered
cutting
off
the
villiage
jerusalem
was
under
seige
being
cut
off
from
its
supply
route
from
tel
aviv
the
bombed
out
supply
trucks
have
been
left
on
the
side
of
that
road
to
this
day
in
memoriam
by
this
time
jews
had
been
killed
of
course
this
isnt
war
since
its
only
the
arabs
attacking
just
like
last
week
when
the
fatah
launched
katyusha
rockets
against
northern
israel
where
does
uprising
end
and
war
begin
will
it
still
be
intifadah
when
the
plo
brings
in
tanks
joseph

gauche
and
proud
in
the
autumn
stillness
see
the
pleiades
jaskewspammathsadelaideedu
remote
in
thorny
deserts
fell
the
grief
disclaimer
sue
see
if
i
care
north
of
our
tents
the
