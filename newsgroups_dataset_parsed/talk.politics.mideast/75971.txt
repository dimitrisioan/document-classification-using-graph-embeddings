BARU
WRITES
NOW
ABOUT
TOUGH
TALK
AND
ARROGANCE
WE
ARE
ADULTS
ARENT
WE
DO
YOU
LISTEN
TO
TOUGH
TALK
OF
AMERICAN
POLITICIANS
OR
SWITCH
THE
CHANNEL
I
GUESS
I
DIDNT
MAKE
MY
POINT
CLEAR
IN
THE
CASE
OF
ISRAEL
GOVERNMENT
IT
IS
NOT
ONLY
TOUGH
TALK
FOR
ITS
INTIMIDATION
POLICY
AFTER
ALL
NOT
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
INTIMIDATED
JUST
BY
TALKING
HERE
HOW
IT
GOES
TOUGH
TALKS
FOLLOWED
BY
AGGRESSIVE
ACTIONS
FOLLOWED
BY
TAKING
PRIDE
OF
THOSE
ACTIONS
AND
BRAGGING
ABOUT
THEM
AGRESSIVE
ACTIONS
ARE
TAKEN
BY
BOTH
SIDES
TOUGH
TALK
IS
DONE
BY
BOTH
SIDES
WHEN
AN
ARAB
LEADER
IS
MENACING
TO
THROW
ALL
JEWS
IN
THE
WATER
IS
ALSO
TOUGH
TALK
I
THINK
AND
KILLING
PEOPLE
IS
MILDLY
AGRESSIVE
JUSTIFIED
IN
YOUR
OPINION
IF
THEY
ARE
ISRAELI
SOLDIERS
JUSTIFIED
IN
OTHERS
OPINION
IF
THEY
ARE
JEWS
NOT
JUSTIFIED
AT
ALL
IN
OTHERS
OPINION
WHEN
BRAD
WROTE
THE
ARTICLE
ABOUT
ISRAELIS
KILLED
THER
WAS
A
LOT
OF
PRIDE
AND
SATISFACTION
IN
HIS
LINES
THATS
WHAT
I
FEEL
DISGUSTING
WE
MAY
AGREE
OR
NOT
WHEN
A
KILLING
IS
TECHNICALLY
MURDER
BUT
BEING
ENTHOUSIASTIC
ABOUT
IT
AND
AGAIN
I
MAY
APPRECIATE
SOME
OF
YOUR
POINTS
BUT
YOU
ARE
NOT
OBJECTIVE
THAT
IS
NOT
A
BLAME
JUST
A
REMARK
