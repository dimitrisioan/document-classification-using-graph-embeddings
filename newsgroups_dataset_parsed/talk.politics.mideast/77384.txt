LONCARIC
WRITES
THE
ANNIHILATION
OF
ISLAM
TURKS
IS
AN
OLDER
SERBIAN
AGENDA
INDEED
SO
WAS
ANNIHILATION
OF
GERMANS
DURING
WWII
HOWEVER
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
QUOTE
ADIL
ZUFLIKARPASIC
IN
HIS
INTERVIEW
TO
DUGA
HAD
SERBS
WANTED
TO
EXTERMINATE
MUSLIMS
THEY
COULD
HAVE
DONE
IT
AFTER
THE
WWI
WHEN
THEY
WERE
THE
MOST
LOVED
SMALL
NATION
IN
EUROPE
SERBS
DID
NOT
DO
THAT
ALTHOUGH
THEY
SUPRESSED
SOME
REBELLIONS
BY
ALBANIAN
MUSLIMS
AND
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
QUITE
BLOODILY
HOWEVER
THIS
IS
QUITE
A
MISREPRESENTATION
AFTER
WWI
MANY
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
WERE
KILLED
AND
THEIR
LAND
TAKEN
OVER
BY
SERBS
AND
THE
MOTIVE
WAS
PLUNDER
NOT
SOME
FICTITIOUS
SUPRESSION
OF
REBELLION
EVEN
EARLIER
ONE
CAN
POINT
TO
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
MOSQUES
IN
SERBIA
ITSELF
AND
EXPULSION
OF
MUSLIMS
HERE
IS
WHAT
DR
VASO
CUBRILOVIC
POLITICAL
ADVISER
TO
THE
SERBIAN
MONARCHIC
REGIME
SAYS
IN
HIS
MEMORANDUM
THE
EXPULSION
OF
THE
ARNAUTS
WHICH
HE
PRESENTED
TO
THE
ROYAL
GOVERNMENT
OF
STOJADINOVIC
ON
MARCH
IN
BELGRADE
THE
MODE
OF
REMOVAL
DESCRIBES
HOW
EXPULSION
OF
ETHNIC
ALBANIANS
FROM
KOSOVA
IS
TO
PROCEED
THROUGH
STATE
TERROR
AND
PRIVATE
INITIATIVE
IE
CHETNIK
PLUNDER
PRIVATE
INITIATIVE
TOO
CAN
ASSIST
GREATLY
IN
THIS
DIRECTION
WE
SHOULD
DISTRIBUTE
WEAPONS
TO
OUR
COLONISTS
AS
NEED
BE
THE
OLD
FORMS
OF
CHETNIK
ACTION
SHOULD
BE
ORGANIZED
AND
SECRETLY
ASSISTED
THE
WHOLE
AFFAIR
SHOULD
BE
PRESENTED
AS
A
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
CLANS
AND
IF
NEED
BE
ASCRIBED
TO
ECONOMIC
REASONS
FINALLY
LOCAL
RIOTS
CAN
BE
INCITED
THESE
WILL
BE
BLOODILY
SUPPRESSED
WITH
THE
CLANS
AND
THE
CHETNIKS
RATHER
THAN
THE
ARMY
THERE
REMAINS
ONE
MORE
MEANS
WHICH
SERBIA
EMPLOYED
WITH
GREAT
PRACTICAL
EFFECT
AFTER
THAT
IS
BY
SECRETLY
BURNING
DOWN
ALBANIAN
VILLAGES
AND
CITY
QUARTERS
EMPHASIS
ABOVE
IS
MINE
THESE
EVENTS
IN
SERBIA
ITSELF
FORCED
OUT
VIRTUALLY
ALL
MUSLIMS
DURING
LATE
CENTURY
THIS
POLICY
OF
STATE
TERRORISM
AGAINST
MUSLIMS
AIDED
BY
CHETNIK
PRIVATE
INITIATIVE
HAS
CONTINUED
IN
WWII
AND
TODAY
FOR
EXAMPLE

HOW
SERBS
KILLED
A
MUSLIM
IN
FOCA
IN
WWII
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
CLAIMED
TO
BE
A
SERBIAN
PATRIOT
EXPLAINING
THEIR
ACTION
AS
FOLLOWS
INASMUCH
AS
YOU
WERE
A
SERB
YOU
SULLIED
THE
SERB
NAME
BECAUSE
YOU
ARE
A
TURK
IE
MUSLIM
AND
SINCE
YOU
HELPED
US
WE
SHALL
NOT
TORTURE
YOU
SO
THE
SHOT
HIM
INSTEAD
OF
CUTTING
HIS
THROAT
IN
THE
PAST
YEAR
SERBS
HAVE
REPEATED
THE
SLAUGHTER
OF
MUSLIM
RESIDENTS
OF
FOCA
DESTRUCTION
OF
MOSQUES
INCLUDING
PRICELESS
HISTORICAL
MONUMENTS
COMPLETES
THE
ERADICATION
OF
THE
MUSLIM
PRESENCE
FROM
TERRITORIES
CLAIMED
BY
SERBS
I
STRONGLY
DISPUTE
YOUR
NOTION
THAT
CROATS
HAD
A
SIMILAR
OLDER
AGENDA
IN
FACT
FOR
THE
PAST
CENTURY
OR
TWO
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
HAVE
SEEN
THEMSELVES
AS
HAVING
A
LOT
IN
COMMON
AND
THEY
GENERALLY
HAD
FRIENDLY
RELATIONS
YOUR
SUGGESTION
THAT
CROATMUSLIM
RELATIONSHIP
IS
ANYTHING
LIKE
SERBMUSLIM
RELATIONSHIP
IS
COMPLETELY
WRONG
TO
SAY
THAT
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
HAVE
A
LOT
IN
COMMON
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THEY
ARE
NOT
SEPARATE
PEOPLES
HOW
TOUCHING
I
HAVE
NEARLY
CRIED
WHILE
I
READ
THIS
UNFORTUNATELY
MOSTLY
UNTRUE
WHICH
PART
DO
YOU
CLAIM
IS
UNTRUE
EXPLAIN
YOURSELF
OR
WITHDRAW
YOUR
CLAIM
CROATS
FROM
CROATIA
MOSTLY
HAD
NO
CONTACTS
WITH
MUSLIMS
SINCE
THEY
WERE
MOSTLY
DEALT
WITH
EXTREME
PREUDICE
LONG
TIME
AGO
HOWEVER
ONE
OF
THE
MAIN
AGENDAS
IS
TURNING
BOSNIA
INTO
PURELY
CATHOLIC
STATE
CROATIA
NEVER
HAD
MANY
MUSLIM
CITIZENS
FOR
HISTORICAL
REASONS
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
NOT
A
PART
OF
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
THE
LAST
MAJOR
BATTLES
BETWEEN
AUSTROHUNGARIAN
MONARCHY
AND
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
IN
CROATIA
WERE
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
CENTURY
NEED
I
REMIND
YOU
THAT
MODERN
CROATIAN
NATIONALISM
CAME
INTO
BEING
WITH
DR
ANTE
STARCEVIC
WHO
SAW
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
AS
THE
BEST
CROATS
SO
MUCH
SO
THAT
IN
HE
CONTEMPLATED
MOVING
HIS
OPERATIONS
TO
SARAJEVO
YOU
ARE
CONFUSING
CLERICALIST
CROATIANISM
WITH
CROATIAN
NATIONALISM
HERE
POLITICAL
NATIONALISM
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
STRONGER
AS
FOR
YOUR
OTHER
THEORIES
YOU
ARE
CLEARLY
OVERJOYED
THAT
CROATMUSLIM
ALLIANCE
IN
BOSNIAHERZEGOVINA
IS
NOW
IN
TROUBLE
ARGUMENTS
SUCH
AS
YOURS
ARE
CLEARLY
INTENDED
TO
CREATE
AND
DEEPEN
THIS
SPLIT
I
SHOULD
ADD
FEW
MORE
THINGS
AJ
EVANS
IN
HIS
ON
FOOT
THROUGH
BH
DESCRIBES
THAT
CATHOLIC
CLERGY
IN
THE
LAST
CENTURY
WAS
APPARENTLY
MORE
SCARED
BY
SERBS
THEN
BY
TURKS
BECAUSE
SERBS
WERE
GROWING
STRONGER
AND
UNLIKE
TURKS
REPRESENTED
GREAT
DANGER
FOR
IDEA
OF
CATHOLIC
BOSNIA
PRESIDENT
TUDJMAN
CLEARLY
STATES
IN
HIS
BOOK
THAT
MUSLIMS
DO
NOT
EXIST
AS
A
SEPARATE
NATION
FROM
CROATS
AND
SERBS
AND
HE
MANY
TIMES
SUGGESTED
EVEN
IN
INTERVIEWES
TO
FOREIGN
PAPERS
THAT
SOLUTION
IS
TO
SPLIT
BOSNIA
JOSIP
KNOWS
THIS
AND
HE
IS
ONLY
WORKING
ON
THE
IMAGE
OF
CROATIA
IN
INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS
YOULL
LEARN
THAT
UNLESS
WEAK
UNITE
TO
COUNTERBALANCE
THE
STRONG
PLAYER
SOON
THEY
ARE
TAKEN
OVER
AND
THATS
THE
END
OF
THEM
BALANCE
OF
POWER
THINKING
HAS
BROUGHT
TOGETHER
CROATS
AND
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
THIS
IS
ONLY
NATURAL
ALL
OTHER
ALIGNMENTS
ARE
UNSTABLE
IM
WORKING
ON
POINTING
OUT
THIS
BASIC
FACT
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
HAVE
BEEN
AWARE
OF
IT
FOR
AS
LONG
AS
SERBIA
HAS
EXISTED
YOU
ARE
WRONG
IF
YOU
THINK
ONLY
IMAGE
IS
AT
STAKE
HERE
CROATIA
HAS
A
DEEP
INTEREST
IN
HER
ALLIANCE
WITH
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
AND
VICE
VERSA
I
THINK
TUDJMAN
UNDERSTANDS
THIS
ALTHOUGH
HE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
MUCH
CHOICE
AT
THIS
POINT
TENSIONS
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DEFUSED
BETTER
EARLIER
BEFORE
ANY
OPEN
CONFRONTATION
DEVELOPED
ALTHOUGH
I
STILL
THINK
CROATIA
WILL
SURVIVE
IT
WILL
LOSE
A
LOT
BUT
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
MAY
END
UP
EVEN
WORSE
OFF
HOWEVER
THEIR
POSITION
NOW
IS
SO
HORRIBLE
THAT
PERHAPS
THEY
DO
NOT
SEE
IT
GETTING
ANY
WORSE
THE
KEY
POINT
IS
DO
THEY
STILL
HAVE
ANY
HOPE
LEFT
IF
NOT
THEN
ALL
BETS
ARE
OFF
MR
STOJANOVIC
IS
CLEARLY
VERY
VERY
HAPPY
ABOUT
THIS
IM
DEEPLY
HURT
THIS
IS
NOT
ABOUT
SOME
IMAGE
BUT
ABOUT
SURVIVAL
OF
A
CONCEPT
OF
A
PARTNERSHIP
WHICH
I
BELIEVE
IS
NATURAL
AND
ESSENTIAL
FOR
BOTH
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
SIGH
