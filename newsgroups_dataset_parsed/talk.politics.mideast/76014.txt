let

clearify
mr
turkish
armenia
is
not
getting
itchy
she
is
simply
letting
the
world
know
that
she
will
no
longer
sit
there
quiet
and
let
turks
get
away
with
their
famous
tricks
armenians
do
remember
of
the
turkish
invasion
of
the
greek
island
of
cypress
while
the
world
simply
watched
and
the
turkish
karabag
is
next

for

in
turkiye
stepped
into
cyprus
to
preserve
the
lives
of
the
turkish
population
there
this
is
nothing
but
a
simple
historical
fact
unfortunately
the
intervention
was
too
late
at
least
for
some
of
the
victims
mass
graves
containing
numerous
bodies
of
women
and
children
already
showed
what
fate
had
been
planned
for
a
peaceful
minority
the
problems
in
cyprus
have
their
origin
in
decades
of
oppression
of
the
turkish
population
by
the
greek
cypriot
officials
and
their
violation
of
the
cofounder
status
of
the
turks
set
out
in
the
constitution
the
coup
detat
engineered
by
greece
in
to
execute
a
final
solution
to
the
turkish
problem
was
the
savage
blow
that
invoked
turkiyes
intervention
turkiye
intervened
reluctantly
and
only
as
a
last
resort
after
exhausting
all
other
avenues
consulting
with
britain
and
greece
as
the
other
two
signatories
to
the
treaty
to
protect
the
integrity
of
cyprus
there
simply
was
not
any
expansionist
motivation
in
the
turkish
action
at
all
this
is
in
dramatic
contrast
to
the
greek
motivation
which
was
openly
expansionist
stated
as
enosis
union
with
greece
since
the
creation
of
independent
cyprus
in
the
turkish
population
although
smaller
legally
had
status
as
the
cofounder
of
the
republic
with
the
greek
population
the
greek
cypriots
with
the
support
of
enosisminded
greeks
in
the
mainland
have
consistently
ignored
that
status
and
portrayed
the
island
as
a
greek
island
with
a
minority
population
of
turks
the
turks
of
cyprus
are
not
a
minority
in
a
greek
republic
and
they
found
the
only
way
they
could
show
that
was
to
assert
their
autonomy
in
a
separate
republic
turkiye
is
not
satisfied
with
the
status
quo
she
would
rather
not
be
involved
with
the
island
but
given
the
dismal
record
of
brutal
greek
oppression
of
the
turkish
population
in
cyprus
she
simply
cannot
leave
the
fate
of
the
islands
turks
in
the
hands
of
the
greeks
until
the
turkish
side
is
satisfied
with
whatever
accord
the
two
communities
finally
reach
to
guarantee
that
history
will
not
repeat
itself
to
rob
turkish
cypriots
