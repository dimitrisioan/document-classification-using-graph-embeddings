WRITES
I
RECENTLY
READ
THAT
DURING
BILL
CLINTONS
CAMPAIGN
HE
STATED
THAT
IF
ELECTED
HE
WOULD
IMMEDIATELY
RECOGNIZE
JERUSALEM
AS
ISRAELS
CAPITAL
ACCORDING
TO
THE
ARTICLE
MR
CLINTON
REAFFIRMED
THIS
AFTER
WINNING
THE
PRESIDENCY
HOWEVER
DURING
RECENT
TALKS
WITH
PRESIDENT
MUBARAK
SECRETARY
OF
STATE
CHRISTOPHER
STATED
THAT
THE
STATUS
OF
JERUSALEM
WILL
BE
A
FINAL
MATTER
OF

BETWEEN

NOW
I
DONT
WANT
TO
START
A
BIG

OVER
THE

I
WANT
TO
KNOW
IS
IF
ANYONE
CAN
AUTHENTICATE
MR

WITH
DATES
PLACES
ETC
FROM
A
RECENT
INTERVIEW
IN
MIDDLE
EAST
INSIGHT
MAGAZINE
CLINTON
SAID
THAT
HE
SUPPORTS
MOVING
THE
US
EMBASSY
TO
JERUSALEM
BUT
WOULD
NOT
DO
SO
AT
THIS
TIME
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
INTERRUPT
THE
PEACE
