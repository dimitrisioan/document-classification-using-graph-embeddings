OF

THAT
ALL

WHILE
THE
TRUTH
IS
THAT
ALL

STEM
FROM
THE

CLAIMS
OF

ON

IT
IS
A

FACT
THAT
BEFORE

THERE
WERE
NO

ON
THE

WHAT

IF

DOES
IT

WILL
ONE

REVEAL

WHEN

IN
THE

AND
DEMOCRACY
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
CHRISTIANS
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
ARE
MOSLEMS
AND
ISLAM
IS
A

ESPECIALLY
UNLOVED
BY

BESIDES
AT
THE

THE

IF

WE
CAN
