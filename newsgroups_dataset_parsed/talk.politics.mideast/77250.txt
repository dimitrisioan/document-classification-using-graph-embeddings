i
like
what
mr
joseph
biden
had
to
say
yesterday
in
the
senate
condemening
the
european
lack
of
action
and
lack
of
support
to
us
plans
and
calling
that
moral
rape
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
reason
for
that
is
out
right
religious
bigotry
actually
this
strife
in
yugoslavia
goes
back
a
long
way
bosinan
muslims
in
collaboration
with
the
nazis
did
to
serbians
after
the
first
world
war
what
serbs
are
doing
to
muslims
now
this
kind
of
racialist
generalization
is
utterly
inappropriate
some
bosnian
muslims
cooperated
with
the
nazis
in
world
war
other
bosnian
muslims
risked
their
lifes
to
hide
jews
from
the
nazis
and
ustashe
and
those
jews
who
survived
the
war
remember
that
in
fact
the
jewish
leader
in
sarajevo
has
remained
there
saying
he
wants
to
repay
the
debt
to
the
bosnian
muslims
that
saved
so
many
jewish
lives
in
similarly
some
serbs
are
doing
to
muslims
now
this
is
a
group
of
serialkillers
rapists
and
thieves
who
have
control
of
the
vast
yugoslav
army
arsenal
many
other
serbs
oppose
these
atrocities
as
one
of
serbian
heritage
who
condemns
emphatically
the
genocide
being
carried
out
against
muslims
by
both
hvo
and
mladic
forces
i
condemn
your
generalization
about
bosnian
muslims
and
about
serbs
this
is
not
a
fresh
case
of
ethnic
cleansing
but
just
another
chapter
in
the
continuing
saga
of
intense
mutual
hatred
destruction
every
place
on
earth
is
the
scene
of
a
saga
of
mutual
hatred
and
destruction
the
holocaust
was
not
a
fresh
case
it
was
another
chapter
in
a
year
history
of
attacks
on
jews
in
europe
that
didnt
make
it
acceptable
and
balkan
history
does
not
make
the
genocide
against
bosnian
muslims
acceptable
not
taking
sides
in
this
perpetual
war
does
not
amount
to
religious
bigotry
standing
by
and
allowing
wellarmed
criminals
to
slaughter
bosnian
muslim
civilians
while
enforcing
an
arms
embargo
against
the
bosnian
muslims
is
not
only
religious
bigotry
it
is
direct
complicity
in
massmurder
it
could
just
be
helplessness
with
regards
to
bringing
peace
to
a
region
that
does
not
even
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
you
tell
us
a
region
on
earth
that
does
have
a
long
history
of
war
nato
is
the
largest
military
police
force
in
the
world
it
was
not
helpless
it
could
have
stopped
the
carnage
a
year
ago
