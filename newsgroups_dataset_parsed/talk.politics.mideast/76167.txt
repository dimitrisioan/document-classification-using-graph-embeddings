INTERVIEW
WITH
SOLDIERS
WHO
SERVED
IN
THE
DUVDEVAN
CHERRY
UNITS
WHICH
DISGUISE
THEMSELVES
AS
ARABS
AND
OPERATE
WITHIN
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
EXCERPTS
FROM
THE
ARTICLE
A
LOT
HAS
BEEN
WRITTEN
ABOUT
THE
UNITS
WHO
DISGUISE
THEMSELVES
AS
ARABS
THINGS
GOOD
AND
BAD
SOME
OF
THE
FALSEHOODS
BUT
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
PROBLEM
OF
THOSE
UNITS
HAS
BEEN
HARDLY
DEALT
WITH
IT
IS
THAT
EVERYONE
WHO
SERVES
IN
THE
CHERRY
AFTER
A
TIME
GOES
IN
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
INSANE
A
MAN
WHO
SAID
THIS
WHO
WILL
HERE
BE
CALLED
DANNY
HIS
FULL
NAME
IS
KNOWN
TO
THE
EDITORS
SERVED
IN
THE
CHERRY
AFTER
HIS
DISCHARGE
FROM
THE
ARMY
HE
WORKS
AS
DELIVERY
BOY
HIS
PAL
WHO
WILL
HERE
BE
CALLED
DUDU
WAS
ALSO
SERVING
IN
THE
CHERRY
AND
IS
NOW
ABOUT
TO
DEPART
FOR
A
ROUNDTHEWORLD
TOUR
THEY
BOTH
LOOK
NO
DIFFERENT
FROM
AVERAGE
ISRAELI
YOUNGSTERS
FRESHLY
DISCHARGED
FROM
CONSCRIPT
SERVICE
BUT
IN
THEIR
SOULS
ONE
CAN
NOTICE
SOMETHING
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENTIT
WAS
NOT
EASY
FOR
THEM
TO
COME
OUT
WITH
DISCLOSURES
ABOUT
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
THEM
AND
THEY
THINK
THAT
TO
MOST
OF
THEIR
FELLOWS
FROM
THE
CHERRY
IT
WOUNDNT
BE
EASY
EITHER
YET
AFTER
THEY
BEGAN
TO
TALK
IT
WAS
NEARLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
MAKE
THEM
STOP
TALKING
THE
FOLLOWING
ARTICLE
WILL
CONTAIN
ALL
THE
HORROR
STORIES
RECOUNTED
WITH
AN
APPALLING
OPENNESS
A
SHORT
TIME
AGO
I
WAS
IN
COMMAND
OF
A
VETERAN
TEAM
IN
WHICH
SOME
OF
THE
FELLOWS
APPLIED
FOR
RELEASE
FROM
THE
CHERRY
WE
CALLED
SUCH
SOLDIERS
HI
HIT
BY
THE
INTIFADA
UNDER
MY
COMMAND
WAS
A
SOLDIER
WHO
TALKED
TO
HIMSELF
NONSTOP
WHICH
IS
A
COMMON
PHENOMENON
IN
THE
CHERRY
I
SENT
HIM
TO
A
PSYCHIATRIST
BUT
WHY
I
SHOULD
TALK
ABOUT
OTHERS
WHEN
I
MYSELF
FEEL
QUITE
INSANE
ON
FRIDAYS
WHEN
I
COME
HOME
MY
PARENTS
KNOW
I
CANNOT
BE
TALKED
TO
UNTIL
I
GO
TO
THE
BEACH
SURF
A
LITTLE
CALM
DOWN
AND
RETURN
THE
KEYS
OF
MY
FATHERS
CAR
MUST
BE
READY
FOR
IN
ADVANCE
SO
THAT
I
CAN
GO
THERE
I
THEY
DARE
TALK
TO
ME
BEFORE
OR
WHENEVER
I
DONT
WANT
THEM
TO
TALK
TO
ME
I
JUST
GRAB
A
CHAIR
AND
SMASH
IT
INSTANTLY
I
KNOW
IT
IS
MY
NERVE
SMASHING
CHAIRS
ALL
THE
TIME
AND
THEN
RUNNING
AWAY
FROM
HOME
TO
THE
CAR
AND
TO
THE
BEACH
ONLY
THERE
I
BECOME
NORMAL
ANOTHER
FRIDAY
I
WAS
EATING
A
LUNCH
PREPARED
BY
MY
MOTHER
IT
WAS
AN
OMELETTE
OF
SORTS
SHE
TOOK
THE
RISK
OF
SITTING
NEXT
TO
ME
AND
TALKING
TO
ME
I
THEN
TOLD
MY
MOTHER
ABOUT
AN
EVENT
WHICH
WAS
STILL
FRESH
IN
MY
MIND
I
TOLD
HER
HOW
I
SHOT
AN
ARAB
AND
HOW
EXACTLY
HIS
WOUND
LOOKED
LIKE
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
INSPECT
IT
SHE
BEGAN
TO
LAUGH
HYSTERICALLY
I
WANTED
HER
TO
CRY
AND
SHE
DARED
LAUGH
STRAIGHT
IN
MY
FACE
INSTEAD
SO
I
TOLD
HER
HOW
MY
PAL
HAD
MADE
A
MINCEMEAT
OF
THE
TWO
ARABS
WHO
WERE
PREPARING
THE
MOLOTOV
COCKTAILS
HE
SHOT
THEM
DOWN
HITTING
THEM
BEAUTIFULLY
EXACTLY
AS
THEY
DESERVED
ONE
BULLET
HAD
SET
A
MOLOTOV
COCKTAIL
ON
FIRE
WITH
THE
EFFECT
THAT
THE
ARAB
WAS
BURNING
ALL
OVER
JUST
BEAUTIFULLY
I
WAS
DELIGHTED
TO
SEE
IT
MY
PAL
FIRED
THREE
BULLETS
TWO
AT
THE
ARAB
WITH
THE
MOLOTOV
COCKTAIL
AND
THE
THIRD
AT
HIS
CHUM
IT
HIT
HIM
STRAIGHT
IN
HIS
ASS
WE
BOTH
FELT
THAT
WED
PULLED
OFF
SOMETHING
NEXT
I
TOLD
MY
MOTHER
HOW
ANOTHER
PAL
OF
MINE
SPLIT
OPEN
THE
GUTS
IN
THE
BELLY
OF
ANOTHER
ARAB
AND
HOW
ALL
OF
US
RAN
TOWARD
THAT
SPOT
TO
TAKE
A
LOOK
I
REACHED
THE
SPOT
FIRST
AND
THEN
THAT
ARAB
BLOOD
GUSHING
FORTH
FROM
HIS
BODY
SPITS
AT
ME
I
YELLED
SHUT
UP
AND
HE
DARED
TALK
BACK
TO
ME
IN
HEBREW
SO
I
JUST
LAUGHED
STRAIGHT
IN
HIS
FACE
I
AM
USUALLY
LAUGHING
WHEN
I
STARE
AT
SOMETHING
CONVULSING
RIGHT
BEFORE
MY
EYES
THEN
I
TOLD
HIM
ALL
RIGHT
WAIT
A
MOMENT
I
LEFT
HIM
IN
ORDER
TO
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
ANOTHER
WOUNDED
ARAB
I
ASKED
A
SOLDIER
IF
THAT
ARAB
COULD
BE
SAVED
IF
THE
BLEEDING
FROM
HIS
ARTERY
COULD
BE
STOPPED
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
A
STONE
OF
SOMETHING
ELSE
LIKE
THAT
I
KEEP
TELLING
ALL
THIS
TO
MY
MOTHER
WITH
DETAILS
AND
SHE
KEEPS
LAUGHING
STRAIGHT
INTO
MY
FACE
THIS
INFURIATED
ME
I
GOT
VERY
ANGRY
BECAUSE
I
FELT
I
WAS
BECOMING
MAD
SO
I
STOPPED
EATING
SEIZED
THE
PLATE
WITH
HE
OMELETTE
AND
SOME
TRIMMINGS
STILL
ON
AND
AT
ONCE
THREW
IT
OVER
HER
HEAD
ONLY
THEN
SHE
STOPPED
LAUGHING
AT
FIRST
SHE
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
SAY
BUT
I
MUST
TELL
YOU
OF
A
STILL
OTHER
MADNESS
WHICH
FALLS
UPON
US
FREQUENTLY
I
WENT
WITH
A
FRIEND
TO
PRACTICE
SHOOTING
ON
A
FIELD
A
GULL
APPEARED
RIGHT
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
FIELD
MY
FRIEND
SHOT
IT
AT
ONCE
THEN
WE
NOTICED
FOUR
DEER
STANDING
HIGH
UP
ON
THE
HILL
ABOVE
US
MY
FRIEND
AT
ONCE
AIMED
AT
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
SHOT
IT
WE
ENJOYED
THE
SIGHT
OF
IT
FALLING
DOWN
THE
ROCK
WE
SHOT
DOWN
TWO
DEER
MORE
AND
WENT
TO
TAKE
A
LOOK
WHEN
WE
CLIMBED
THE
ROCKS
WE
SAW
A
YOUNG
DEER
BADLY
WOUNDED
BY
OUR
BULLET
BUT
STILL
TRYING
TO
SUCH
SOME
MILK
FROM
ITS
ALREADY
DEAD
MOTHER
WE
CAREFULLY
INSPECTED
TWO
PATHS
COVERED
BY
BLOOD
AND
CHUNKS
OF
TORN
FLESH
OF
THE
TWO
DEER
WE
HAD
HIT
WE
WERE
JUST
DELIGHTED
BY
THAT
SIGHT
WE
HAD
HITEM
SO
GOOD
THEN
WE
DECIDED
TO
KILL
THE
YOUNG
DEER
TOO
SO
AS
SPARE
IT
FURTHER
SUFFERING
I
APPROACHED
TOOK
OUT
MY
REVOLVER
AND
SHOT
HIM
IN
THE
HEAD
SEVERAL
TIMES
FROM
A
VERY
SHORT
DISTANCE
WHEN
YOU
SHOOT
STRAIGHT
AT
THE
HEAD
YOU
ACTUALLY
SEE
THE
BULLETS
SINKING
IN
BUT
MY
FIFTH
BULLET
MADE
ITS
BRAINS
FALL
OUTSIDE
ONTO
THE
GROUND
WITH
THE
EFFECT
OF
SPLATTERING
LOTS
OF
BLOOD
STRAIGHT
ON
US
THIS
MADE
US
FEEL
CURED
OF
THE
SPURT
OF
OUR
MADNESS
STANDING
THERE
SOAKED
WITH
BLOOD
WE
FELT
WE
WERE
LIKE
BEASTS
OF
PREY
WE
COULDNT
EXPLAIN
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
TO
US
WE
WERE
ALMOST
IN
TEARS
WHILE
WALKING
DOWN
FROM
THAT
HILL
AND
WE
FELT
THE
WHOLE
DAY
VERY
BADLY
WE
ALWAYS
GO
BACK
TO
PLACES
WE
CARRIED
OUT
ASSIGNMENTS
IN
THIS
IS
WHY
WE
CAN
SEE
THEM
WHEN
YOU
SEE
A
GUY
YOU
DISABLED
MAY
BE
FOR
THE
REST
OF
HIS
LIFE
YOU
FEEL
YOU
GOT
POWER
YOU
FEEL
GODLIKE
OF
SORTS
BOTH
DANNY
AND
DUDU
CONTEMPLATE
AT
LEAST
AT
THIS
MOMENT
STUDYING
THE
ACTING
DUDU
IS
NOT
WILLING
TO
WORK
IN
ANY
SECURITYLINKED
OCCUPATION
DANNY
FEELS
THE
EXACT
OPPOSITE
WHY
SHOULDNT
I
TAKE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THE
SKILLS
I
HAVE
MASTERED
SO
WELL
WHY
SHOULDNT
I
EARN
FOR
EACH
CHOPPED
HEAD
I
WOULD
DELIVER
WHILE
BEING
A
MERCENARY
IN
SOUTH
AFRICA
THIS
KIND
OF
JOB
SUITS
ME
PERFECTLY
I
HAVE
NO
HUMAN
EMOTIONS
ANY
MORE
IF
I
GET
A
REASONABLE
SALARY
I
WILL
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
TO
BOARD
A
PLANE
TO
BOSNIA
IN
ORDER
TO
FIGHT
THERE
