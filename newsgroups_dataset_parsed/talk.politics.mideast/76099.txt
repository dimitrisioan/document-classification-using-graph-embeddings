investment
in
yehuda
and
shomron
in
todays
israeline
posting
at
the
end
an
afterthought
i
read
more
money
allocated
to
building
infrastructure
in
territories
to
create
jobs
for
palestinians
kol
yisrael
reports
that
public
works
geared
at
building
infrastructure
costing
million
new
israeli
shekels
about
million
dollars
will
begin
sunday
in
the
territories
this
was
announced
last
night
by
prime
minister
yitzhak
rabin
and
finance
minister
avraham
shohat
in
an
effort
to
create
more
jobs
for
palestinian
residents
of
the
territories
this
infusion
of
money
will
bring
allocations
given
to
developing
infrastructure
in
the
territories
this
year
to
million
nis
up
from
last
years
figure
of
million
nis
while
i
applaud
investing
of
money
in
yehuda
shomron
vchevelazza
in
order
to
create
jobs
for
their
residents
i
find
it
deplorable
that
this
has
never
been
an
active
policy
of
any
israeli
administration
since
with
regard
to
their
jewish
residents
past
governments
found
funds
to
subsidize
cheap
read
affordable
housing
and
the
requisite
infrastructure
but
where
was
the
investment
for
creating
industry
which
would
have
generated
income
and
jobs
after
years
yehuda
and
shomron
remain
barren
bereft
of
even
middlesized
industries
and
the
jewish
settlements
are
sterile
bedroom
communities
havens
for
in
the
main
israelis
both
secular
and
religious
who
work
in
telaviv
or
jerusalem
but
cannot
afford
to
live
in
either
city
or
their
surrounding
suburbs
theres
an
old
saying
bli
giboosh
ayn
kivoosh
just
living
there
wasnt
enough
we
had
to
really
settle
it
but
instead
we
settled
for
potemkin
villages
and
now
we
are
paying
the
price
and
doing
for
others
what
we
should
have
done
for
ourselves
yonatan
b
horen
jews
who
do
not
base
their
advocacy
of
jewish
positions
and
interests
on
judaism
are
essentially
racists
the
only
horennetcomcom
morally
defensible
grounds
for
the
preservation
of
jews
as
a
separate
people
rest
on
their
religious
identity
as
jews
