WRITES
IVE
HEARD
MANY
TURKS
SAY
THIS
AND
IT
SURPISES
ME
THAT
THEY
DONT
READ
ABOUT
ITREMEMBER
THE
TREATY
OF
SEVRESAS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
BEING
IN
THE
AXIS
POWERS
IN
WWITHE
TURKS
UNDER
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
WERE
SUPPOSED
TO
LOOK
AFTER
THEIR
MINORITIES
IE
GREEKSARMENIANSKURDSI
MUST
SAY
TURKKURD
RELATIONS
ARE
IMPROVING
SLIGHTLY
WITH
TIME
AND
NOT
POSE
A
THREAT
TO
TURKEYS
NEIGHBOURS
THE
TURKS
BLATANTLY
REJECTED
THIS
TREATYTHE
GERMANS
GRUDGINGLY
ACCEPTED
VERSAILLES
WHICH
WAS
A
MILLION
TIMES
WORSE
FOR
THE
HEALTH
AND
PRIDE
OF
THE
GERMAN
PEOPLETHE
GREEKS
WHO
HAD
AN
ARMY
THEREWERE
THERE
WITH

AND
FRENCH
BACKING
TO
ENFORCE

IN
POSSIBLY
THE
FIRST
EXAMPLE
OF

SCREWED
THE

OUT
OF

WAS
AFTER
THE
GREEK

WERE
DESTROYED
AT
SMYRNAWHEN
THIS
OCCURRED
INCIDENTLY
FRENCH
WARSHIPS
WERE
IN
THE
HARBOUR
AND
MANY
GREEKS
TRYING
ESCAPE
SWAM
TO
THE
FRENCH
WARSHIPS
AND
CLIMBED
ABOARD
ONLY
TO
GET
THEIR

CUT
OFF
BY

LIBERTAEEGALITAEFRATERNATAE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
YOU
ARE
THE
ONE
WHO
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
DO
SOME
READING
I
THINK
THAT
OUR
MAJOR
DIFFERENCE
IN
OPINION
IS
ON
THE
LEGITIMACY
OF
SEVRES
FIRST
THATTREATY
WAS
SIGNED
BY
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
THEREFORE
LEGALLY
IT
DOES
NOT
BIND
THE
REPUBLIC
OF
TURKEY
THE
NEW
INDEPENDENCE
MOVEMENT
WHICH
BY
THE
WAY
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
THE
YOUNG
TURKS
NATURALLY
REJECTED
IT
OUT
OF
HAND
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
SHOULD
ACCEPT
BECAUSE
THE
GERMANS
DID
THEIRS
IS
ABSURD
WE
SAW
WHAT
THE
COSEQUENCES
OF
SUCH
HARSH
TREATIES
WERE
IN
HITLER
SECOND
THE
SEVRES
TREATY
WAS
EVEN
WORSE
THAN
VERSAILLES
IT
DIVIDED
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
IN
TO
SEVERAL
INFLUENCE
ZONES
HAD
THE

OCCUPIED
THE
ECONOMY
UNDER
ALLIED
CONTROL
THE
ARMY
DI
MINISHED
TO
NOTHING
BUT
A
POLICE
FORCE
IN
SHORT
A
COUNTRY
IN

ONLY
ID
WONDER
IF
YOU
WOULD
LIKE
TO
LIVE
UNDER
SUCH
CONDITIONS
AND
FOR
THE
RECORD
I
DONOT
FEEL
SORRY
FOR
THE
SOLDIERS
KILLED
IN
IZMIR
HARBOUR
BEFORE
EVACUATING
THE
CITY
THE
GREEK
FORCES
BURNED
IT
DOWN
SO
IT
SERVES
THEM
RIGHT
AS
FOR
BEING
FOOLED
BY
ALLIED
PROMISES
THAT
TOO
IS
YOUR
FAULT
YOU
DID
NOT
COME
TO
ANATOLIA
JUST
TO
ENFORCE
SEVRES
BUT
TO
TAKE
PART
IN
THE
PLUNDER
AS
WELL
