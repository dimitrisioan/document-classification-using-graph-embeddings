BOSNIANS

JOSIPENGUMDEDU
JOSIP
LONCARIC
WRITES
AND
WAS
SOUNDLY
REJECTED
THE
REASONS
ARE
PRAGMATIC
EVEN
IF
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
ARE
CROATS
AND
SERBS
WHO
CONVERTED
TO
ISLAM
UNDER
TURKISH
RULE
CENTURIES
AGO
NONE
OF
THE
PRESENT
GENERATION
HAS
ANY
CLUE
WHAT
WAS
THEIR
ANCESTORS
ACTUAL
NATIONALITY
IN
FACT
ALTHOUGH
I
AM
FORCED
TO
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
FIRST
OF
ALL
ONE
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
BORN
FROM
A
NONTURKISH
NONMUSLIM
PARENT
OUTSIDE
THE
TURKISH
LAND
YET
STILL
CAN
BE
A
TURK
PROVIDED
THIS
PERSON
CALLS
HIMSELF
OR
HERSELF
A
TURK
BECAUSE
THE
DESIGNATION
OF
A
TURK
IS
NOT
A
GENETIC
FEATURE
NOT
A
RACIAL
OR
RELIGIOUS
FEATURE
IT
IS
A
MATTER
OF
IDENTIFYING
WITH
THE
TURKISH
VALUES
SECONDLY
THE
FOLLOWING
OBSERVATIONS
BY
WESTERNERS
WERE
WRITTEN
IN
FRENCH
BY
AHMET
CEVAT
IF
TURKS
HAD
BEHAVED
LIKE
CHRISTIANS
TO
USE
FORCE
TO
CONVERT
TO
ISLAM
THE
NATIONS
WHICH
THEY
BROUGHT
UNDER
THEIR
POWER
TO
WHICH
NO
ONE
COULD
HAVE
OPPOSED
TODAY
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
EASTERN
PROBLEM
BUT
TURKS
DID
NOT
DO
SO
THEY
OBEYED
THE
WORD
OF
THE
KORAN
TO
PERMIT
EVERYBODY
TO
WORSHIP
IN
THEIR
OWN
WAY
CENTURIES
BEFORE
FREDERICK
THE
GREAT
PRONOUNCED
HIS
FAMOUS
DICTUM
THUS
IN
AN
AGE
WHEN
THE
CHRISTIAN
EUROPE
ITSELF
SHED
CHRISTIAN
BLOOD
AND
WHEN
PEOPLE
IN
EUROPE
ENJOYED
INFLICTING
INHUMAN
TORTURES
UPON
THOSE
WHOSE
BELIEFS
DIFFERED
FROM
THEIRS
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
BECAME
THE
SOLE
COUNTRY
WHERE
THE
INQUISITION
DID
NOT
EXIST
WHERE
DEATHS
AT
THE
STAKE
WERE
UNHEARD
OF
AND
WHERE
ACCUSATIONS
OF
WITCHCRAFT
WERE
NOT
MADE
AND
THE
BARBARIAN
TURKEY
WAS
THE
ONLY
COUNTRY
WHERE
THE
JEWS
PERSECUTED
AND
CHASED
AWAY
EVERYWHERE
BY
THE
CHRISTIANS
COULD
FIND
ASYLUM
THESE
FACTS
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
MUSLIM
COUNTRIES
PROVIDED
SPIRITUALLY
FAR
BETTER
LIVING
CONDITIONS
THAN
CHRISTIAN
THE
TURKS
WHO
ARE
A
CONQUERING
NATION
DID
NOT
TURKIFY
THE
NATIONS
THAT
CAME
UNDER
THEIR
RULE
INSTEAD
THEY
RESPECTED
THEIR
RELIGIONS
AND
TRADITIONS
IT
WAS
A
STROKE
OF
LUCK
FOR
ROMANIA
TO
LIVE
UNDER
TURKISH
RULE
INSTEAD
OF
RUSSIAN
OR
AUSTRIAN
RULE
BECAUSE
OTHERWISE
THERE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
A
ROMANIAN
NATION
TODAY
POPESCU
CIOCANEL
TURKS
RULE
OVER
PEOPLE
UNDER
THEIR
ADMINISTRATION
ONLY
EXTERNALLY
WITHOUT
INTERFERING
WITH
THEIR
INTERNAL
STRUCTURES
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
THIS
THE
AUTONOMY
OF
MINORITIES
IN
TURKEY
IS
BETTER
AND
MORE
COMPLETE
THAN
ANY
IN
THE
MOST
ADVANCED
EUROPEAN
HUMAN
BEINGS
HATE
EACH
OTHER
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
RELIGIOUS
DIFFERENCES
THIS
FLAW
IS
OLDER
THAN
ISLAM
AND
CHRISTIANITY
BUT
THERE
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
ANY
EXAMPLES
OF
THIS
ADJURATION
IN
TURKEY
BECAUSE
TURKS
NEVER
OPPRESS
ANYBODY
ON
ACCOUNT
OF
HIS
RELIGION
IF
ENMITY
ON
THE
BASIS
OF
RELIGION
HAD
BEEN
SUCH
A
CASE
OF
SIMPLE
CONTEMPT
AMONG
US
TOO
OR
IF
IT
DID
NOT
KEEP
TRANSLATING
ITSELF
INTO
ACTION
MANY
NATIONS
IN
OUR
EUROPE
WOULD
PROBABLY
HAVE
CONSIDERED
THEMSELVES
HAPPY
A
DE
TURKEY
NEVER
BECAME
A
SCENE
FOR
RELIGIOUS
TERROR
OR
FOR
THE
CRUELTY
OF
THE
INQUISITION
ON
THE
CONTRARY
IT
SERVED
AS
AN
ASYLUM
FOR
THE
UNFORTUNATE
VICTIMS
OF
CHRISTIAN
FANATICISM
IF
YOU
LOOK
INTO
HISTORY
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
IN
THE
FIFTEENTH
CENTURY
THOUSANDS
OF
JEWS
WHO
WERE
EXPELLED
FROM
SPAIN
AND
PORTUGAL
FOUND
SUCH
A
GOOD
ASYLUM
IN
TURKEY
THAT
THEIR
DESCENDANTS
HAVE
BEEN
LIVING
THERE
VERY
CALMLY
ALL
THROUGH
THESE
APPROXIMATELY
THREE
HUNDRED
YEARS
AND
ARE
ONLY
FORCED
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
IN
SOME
COUNTRIES
AGAINST
THE
CRUELTY
OF
CHRISTIANS
ESPECIALLY
THAT
OF
THE
ORTHODOXES
NO
JEW
IS
ABLE
TO
APPEAR
IN
PUBLIC
DURING
EASTER
CELEBRATIONS
IN
ATHENS
EVEN
TODAY
IN
TURKEY
HOWEVER
IF
THE
ISRAELITES
ARE
INSULTED
BY
THE
GREEK
AND
ARMENIAN
COMMUNITIES
LOCAL
COURTS
IMMEDIATELY
TAKE
THEM
UNDER
THEIR
PROTECTION
IN
THAT
VAST
AND
CALM
COUNTRY
OF
THE
SULTAN
ALL
RELIGIONS
AND
NATIONS
ARE
LIVING
TOGETHER
PEACEFULLY
ALTHOUGH
THE
MOSQUE
IS
SUPERIOR
TO
THE
CHURCH
AND
THE
SYNAGOGUE
IT
DOES
NOT
REPLACE
THEM
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
THE
CATHOLIC
SECT
IS
MORE
FREE
IN
ISTANBUL
AND
SMYRNA
COMPARED
WITH
PARIS
AND
LYON
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
FACT
THAT
NO
LAW
IN
TURKEY
PROHIBITS
THE
OPENAIR
CEREMONIES
OF
THIS
SECT
NEITHER
DOES
ANY
LAW
IMPRISON
ITS
CROSS
IN
THE

THE
