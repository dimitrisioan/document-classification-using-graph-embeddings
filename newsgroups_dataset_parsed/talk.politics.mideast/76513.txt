p
new
details
of
extensive
adl
spy
operation
emerge
san
francisco
to
the
outside
world
roy
bullock
was
a
smalltime
art
dealer
who
operated
from
his
house
in
the
castro
district
in
reality
he
was
an
undercover
spy
who
picked
through
garbage
and
amassed
secret
files
for
the
antidefamation
league
for
nearly
years
the
antidefamation
league
a
selfdescribed
jewish
defense
and
civil
rights
organization
acknowledges
it
has
long
collected
information
on
groups
that
are
antisemitic
extremist
or
racist
the
adls
factfinding
division
headed
by
irwinn
suall
in
new
york
enjoys
a
reputation
for
thoroughness
and
has
often
shared
its
information
with
police
agencies
and
journalists
there
is
something
almost
comical
in
the
fact
that
yigal
arens
is
important
enough
to
have
the
adl
and
gd
knows
who
else
sifting
through
his
garbage
which
happens
to
be
legal
you
throw
it
out
it
aint
yours
any
more
this
brings
to
mind
a
few
possibilities
other
than
the
adl
connection
it
is
all
in
arens
mind
bullock
may
have
been
working
for
arens
friend
in
the
plo
arens
father
or
is
it
brother
moshe
arens
former
israeli
defense
minister
was
spying
on
him
arens
hired
bullock
to
spy
on
him
to
get
attention
in
any
case
who
cares
