WRITES
YOUVE
ASKED
A
CRUCIAL
QUESTION
THAT
UNDERLIES
MUCH
OF
THE
GENOCIDE
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
ARE
SLAVIC
IN
ETHNICITY
THEY
SPEAK
SERBOCROATIAN
BUT
THERE
IS
A
CHRISTOSLAVIC
IDEOLOGY
WHEREBY
ALL
TRUE
SLAVS
ARE
CHRISTIAN
AND
ANYONE
WHO
CONVERTED
TO
ISLAM
THEREBY
MUST
HAVE
CHANGED
ETHNICITY
BY
CHANGING
RELIGION
MUSLIM
IN
EXYUGOSLAVIA
WAS
A
NATION
NOT
A
RELIGION
IN
FACT
NOT
ALL
MUSLIMS
IN
BH
ARE
FOLLOWERS
OF
ISLAM
THEREFORE
THERE
DO
DID
EXIST
IN
EXYUGOSLAVIA
CHRISTIAN
MUSLIMS
TITO
DEFINED
THE
MUSLIM
NATION
CONSTITUTIONALLY
ADDING
MUSLIMS
TO
SERBS
CROATS
AND
SLOVENES
THE
THREE
FOUNDING
NATIONS
WHICH
ENTERED
INTO
A
VOLUNTARY
UNION
AT
THE
END
OF
WWI
IN
ADDITION
TITO
ADDED
TWO
OTHER
NATIONS
CONSTITUTIONALLY
MONTENEGRINS
AND
MAKEDONIJANS
NATIONS
HAD
THE
RIGHT
OF
SECESSION
BUT
REPUBLICS
DID
NOT
SO
MUSLIM
IS
MUCH
MORE
A
POLITICAL
TERM
THAN
A
RELIGIOUS
TERM
FOR
THOSE
WHO
DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN
RELIGION
AND
POLITICS
THAT
IS
IN
BH
IT
WAS
NOT
A
CHRISTOSLAVIC
IDEOLOGY
THAT
MADE
A
MUSLIM
NATION
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
IT
WAS
THE
ATHEIST
COMMUNIST
IDEOLOGY
OF
TITO
BEFORE
TITO
THERE
WAS
NO
MUSLIM
NATION
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
THE
WAR
IS
NOT
A
RELIGIOUS
WAR
AND
IT
IS
NOT
AN
ETHNIC
WAR
IT
IS
A
CIVIL
WAR
IN
WHICH
THE
TERMS
OF
SECESSION
ARE
BEING
NEGOTIATED
WITH
GUNS
INSTEAD
OF
PENS
THE
CROAT
MUSLIM
AND
SERB
POLITICAL
LEADERS
ALL
CHOSE
TO
FIGHT
OVER
THE
TERMS
OF
SECESSION
INSTEAD
OF
COMPROMISING
AND
PEACEFULLY
NEGOTIATING
MULTILATERAL
SECESSION
