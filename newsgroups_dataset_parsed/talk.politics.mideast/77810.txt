IN

STEPPED
INTO

TO

THE
LIVES
OF
THE

THERE
THIS
IS
NOTHING
BUT
A
SIMPLE
HISTORICAL
FACT
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
INTERVENTION
WAS
TOO
LATE
AT

FOR
SOME
OF
THE
VICTIMS
MASS
GRAVES
CONTAINING
NUMEROUS
BODIES
OF

ALREADY
SHOWED
WHAT
FATE
HAD
BEEN
PLANNED
FOR
A
PEACEFUL
MINORITY
THE
PEOPLE
OF
TURKIYE
KNOW
QUITE
WELL
THAT
GREECE
AND
THE
GREEK
CYPRIOTS
WILL
NEVER
ABANDON
THE
IDEA
OF
HELLENIZING
CYPRUS
AND
WILL
REMAIN
ETERNALLY
HOPEFUL
OF
UNITING
IT
WITH
GREECE
SOMEDAY
WHATEVER
THE
COST
TO
THE
PARTIES
INVOLVED
THE
HISTORY
SPEAKS
FOR
ITSELF
GREECE
WAS
THE
SOLE
PERPETRATOR
OF

WHEN
IT
SENT

IN

THE
RELEASE
OF
NIKOS
SAMPSON
A
MEMBER
OF
EOKA
NATIONAL
ORGANIZATION
OF
CYPRIOT
FIGHTERS
AND
A
CONVICTED
TERRORIST
SHOWS
THAT
THE
ENOSIS
MENTALITY
CONTINUES
TO
SURVIVE
IN
GREECE
ONE
SHOULD
NOT
FORGET
THAT
SAMPSON
DEDICATED
HIS
LIFE
TO
ANNIHILATING
THE
TURKS
IN
CYPRUS
COMMITTED
MURDER
TO
ACHIEVE
THIS
GOAL
AND
TRIED
TO
DESTROY
THE
ISLANDS
INDEPENDENCE
BY
ANNEXING
IT
TO
GREECE
OF
COURSE
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENTS
WILL
HAVE
TO
BEAR
THE
CONSEQUENCES
FOR
THIS
IRRESPONSIBLE
CONDUCT
TURKISH
CYPRIOTS
ARE
SIMPLY
SEEKING
GUARANTEES
THAT
WILL
PRECLUDE
A
REPEAT
PERFORMANCE
BY
THE
FANATICAL
CADRES
OF
THE
GREEKS
EOKA
IF
SUCH
ASSURANCES
ARE
NOT
PERFECTLY
IMPLEMENTED
THERE
IS
EVERY
REASON
TO
EXPECT
THAT
THE
LOCAL
GREEKS
WILL
BE
MISGUIDED
ENOUGH
TO
PERPETRATE
THEIR
PAST
MISTAKES
ON
SUCH
AN
OCCASION
THE
TURKISH
SIDE
MAY
NOT
FIND
IT
SATISFACTORY
TO
ACT
WITH
RELUCTANCE
TO
GO
ANY
FURTHER
THAN
BEFORE
FOR
IT
IS
UNACCEPTABLE
TO
REMAIN
ALWAYS
DEFENSIVE
AGAINST
CYCLICAL
VICIOUS
ATTACKS
THEREFORE
IT
WOULD
BE
BETTER
TO
HAVE
A
TRUE
FEDERATION
OF
TWO
SEPARATE
SECTIONS
LIVING
IN
OBLIGATORY
PEACE
RATHER
THAN
ANOTHER
ARMED
CONFRONTATION
THAT
WOULD
BE
STARTED
BY
THE
GREEKS
AND
OBLIGATORILY
BUT
DECISIVELY
TERMINATED
BY
THE
TURKS
THE
PRESENT
GREEK
GOVERNMENT
IS
TRYING
TO
TYRANNIZE
THE
TURKISH
POPULATION
IN
WESTERN
THRACE
BY
FORBIDDING
IT
ITS
ETHNIC
AND
RELIGIOUS
RIGHTS
WHICH
WERE
ESTABLISHED
THROUGH
INTERNATIONAL
TREATIES
ONE
MIGHT
BE
BETTER
ADVISED
TO
REMEMBER
THAT
MISADVENTURES
AGAINST
TURKIYE
DO
NOT
SERVE
GREECE
WELL
AN
OFFER
OF
MEMBERSHIP
IN
THE
EUROPEAN
COMMON
MARKET
AS
BAIT
FOR
CONCESSIONS
THAT
MAY
DOOM
THE
TURKS
IN
CYPRUS
TO

IS
NOT
A
VIABLE
COURSE
FOR
GREECE
OR
HER
FRIENDS
NEITHER
TURKISH
