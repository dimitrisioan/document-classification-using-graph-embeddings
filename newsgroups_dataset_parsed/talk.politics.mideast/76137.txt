re
nazi
eugenic
theories
circulated
by
in
article
center

cprigcapcorg
writes
ps
my
proposal
has
nothing
to
do
with
nazi
eugenics
it
has
to
do
with
the
search
for
peace
which
would
enable
justice
i
dont
consider
that
justice
is
done
when
nonjews
who
fled
or
were
expelled
in
are
not
permitted
to
return
to
their
homeland
how
about
jews
who
were
expelled
from
their
homelands
in
iraq
syria
jordan
algeria
etc
dont
they
deserve
justice
too
this
can
at
best
be
called
pragmatism
a
nice
word
for
legitimizing
the
rule
of
the
strong
it
can
never
be
called
justice
why
is
your
criticism
always
directed
against
israel
but
never
against
the
arab
states
even
when
they
are
so
much
more
guilty
of
the
accusations
you
make
is
it
because
you
now
call
yourself
a
palestinean
and
peace
without
justice
will
never
be
peace
this
is
why
the
landforpeace
formula
is
so
foolish
landforland
or
peaceforpeace
seems
much
more
just
except
that
it
would
cost
the
arabs
something
and
so
is
not
under
consideration
lets
not
forget
that
about
half
of
israels
population
are
refugees
from
arab
countries
somehow
their
land
now
being
occupied
by
arab
states
and
their
homes
now
being
livedin
by
arab
people
are
not
included
in
any
negotiations
is
this
your
prescription
for
peace
it
is
my
conviction
that
the
situation
in
which
a
state
through
the
law
attempts
to
discourage
mixed
marriages
as
israel
does
is
not
normal
such
a
state
resembles
more
nazi
germany
and
south
africa
than
western
democracies
such
as
the
united
states
in
which
jews
are
free
to
marry
whom
they
wish
and
do
so
in
the
thousands
again
youve
somehow
managed
to
overlook
the
fact
that
the
arab
states
are
much
more
restrictive
on
these
points
in
fact
the
officially
judenrein
policies
of
almost
all
of
the
arab
states
makes
them
resemble
nazi
germany
chillingly
closely
american
jews
enjoy
this
fact
and
would
not
love
to
live
in
a
state
termed
christian
state
and
to
have
their
green
cards
stamped
with
a
mark
jew
there
are
many
states
in
which
christians
can
live
happily
many
which
have
official
religions
and
christian
majorities
and
christianbased
laws
there
are
some
dozen
arab
and
islamic
states
there
is
only
one
jewish
state
do
you
have
a
problem
with
this
is
this
one
jewish
state
too
many
there
are
others
who
might
agree
with
you
you
know
i
would
ask
those
who
are
genuinely
interested
in
an
exchange
of
views
and
personal
experiencces
to
refrain
from
emotional
infantile
outbursts
which
might
leed
readers
to
infer
that
jews
who
respect
judaism
are
uncivilized
such
behaviour
is
not
good
for
judaism
have
you
just
arrived
on
tpm
recently
again
the
supporters
of
the
arab
and
islamic
camps
are
frequently
and
massively
guilty
of
emotional
infantile
outbursts
which
have
weakened
their
positions
dramatically
somehow
your
criticisms
are
very
onesided
and
simpleminded
