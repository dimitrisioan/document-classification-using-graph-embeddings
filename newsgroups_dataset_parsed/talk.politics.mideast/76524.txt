SO
NICE
OF
YOU
ALL
TO
ANSWER
SOME
QUESTIONS
AND
IT
SO
NICE
THAT
MOST
OF
YOU
FEEL
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
IN
YOUR
HEARTS
TO
GIVE
THE
PALESTINIANS
SOME
LAND
MOST
OF
YOU
FOCUS
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
ISRAEL
ANNEXED
ALL
THIS
LAND
AND
IT
IS
A
KIND
GESTURE
TO
GIVE
SOME
OF
IT
BACK
WELL
I
HOPE
THAT
AFTER
AFTER
A
STATE
RUN
BY
PALESTINIANS
IS
ESTABLISHED
THE
FIRST
DECISION
SHOULD
BE
TO
MAKE
JERUSALEM
PART
OF
THIS
STATE
BY
ANNEXING
IT
OF
COURSE
STEVE
STEVE
IF
THE
ISRAELIS
ARE
STUPID
ENOUGH
TO
ALLOW
A
SECOND
PALESTINIAN
STATE
THE
FIRST
ONE
IS
JORDON
THEN
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
GET
YOUR
WISH
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
WOULD
GET
WHATS
COMING
TO
THEM
HOWEVER
IF
THE
PALESTINIANS
WERE
TO
SOMEHOW
DEMONSTRATE
THAT
THEY
COULD
GOVERN
THEMSELVES
AND
LIVE
IN
PEACE
WITH
THEIR
JEWISH
NEIGHBORS
THEN
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
TO
GIVE
UP
THE
IDEA
OF
JERUSALEM
AS
A
PART
OF
THEIR
STATE
AND
YOU
WOULD
BE
DISAPPOINTED
ISRAEL
HAS
NOT
ANNEXED
ANY
OF
THE
WEST
BANK
JUST
JERUSELUM
WHICH
WILL
REMAIN
PART
OF
ISRAEL
FOREVER
YASHIR
KOACH

THIS
BEN
