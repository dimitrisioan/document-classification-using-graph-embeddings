WRITES
I
COMPLAINED
ABOUT
THE
US
TAKING
THE
POINT
IN
BOSNIA
WHEN
THE
EUROPEANS
SHOULD
BE
DOING
IT
KEN
SAYS
THE
BOSNIANS
ARE
MORALLY
SUPERIOR
TO
THE
SERBIANS
THIS
IMPLIES
BOTH
SIDES
ARE
EQUAL
TRUE
IT
MAY
SOMETIMES
BE
DIFFICULT
OR
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DETERMINE
WHICH
SIDE
IS
THE
VICTIM
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
VICTIMS
DO
NOT
EXIST
YES
VICTIMS
EXIST
THERE
ARE
A
STAGGERING
NUMBER
OF
VICTIMS
IN
THE
WORLD
AND
MORE
EACH
DAY
I
THINK
ON
BALANCE
INTERVENTION
WOULD
CREATE
MORE
VICTIMS
INCLUDING
AMERICAN
ONES
SINCE
THE
FIRST
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
IS
TO
PROTECT
AMERICANS
I
THINK
THEY
SERVE
THAT
ROLE
BEST
BY
STAYING
AWAY
FROM
BOSNIA
AND
OTHER
REGIONAL
CONFLICTS
WOULD
YOU
IN
WWII
HAVE
SAID
THAT
THERE
WERE
ATROCITIES
ON
THE
SIDES
OF
BOTH
THE
JEWS
AND
THE
GERMANS
OF
COURSE
NOT
THE
JEWS
WERE
NOT
TRYING
TO
CARVE
A
TERRITORY
OUT
OF
GERMANY
EITHER
AND
EXCEPT
FOR
SMALLSCALE
RESISTANCE
AND
A
FEW
LARGER
UPRISINGS
DID
NOT
HAVE
AN
ARMY
OR
A
GOVERNMENT
THESE
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
BUTCHERING
EACH
OTHER
FOR
CENTURIES
WHEN
ONE
SIDE
WINS
AND
GETS
WHAT
IT
WANTS
IT
WILL
STOP
YES
BUT
BOTH
SIDES
WANT
DIFFERENT
THINGS
THE
MUSLIMS
CHIEFLY
WANT
TO
NOT
BE
ETHNIC
CLEANSED
THE
SERBIANS
WANT
TO
ETHNIC
CLEANSE
THE
MUSLIMS
IT
IS
INDEED
TRUE
THAT
EACH
SIDE
WILL
STOP
WHEN
IT
GETS
WHAT
IT
WANTS
BUT
THE
THINGS
THAT
THE
TWO
SIDES
WANT
ARE
NOT
EQUIVALENT
I
SEE
THE
PATTERN
OF
ATROCITIES
AS
A
FAIRLY
OFTEN
PRACTICED
TACTIC
OF
A
COLONIZING
POWER
DRIVING
AWAY
ANDOR
ELIMINATING
THE
POPULATION
OF
AN
AREA
THEY
WANT
TO
CONTROL
THE
US
TRIED
BASICALLY
THAT
IN
VIETNAM
THE
IRAQIS
IN
KUWAIT
THE
ISRAELIS
IN
PALESTINE
SOUTH
AFRICA
ETC
ETC
ETC
IT
SUCKS
ITS
UGLY
AND
ITS
SADDENING
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
GENOCIDE
IT
IS
NOT
MY
IMPRESSION
THAT
THE
SERBS
WANT
TO
ELIMINATE
EVERY
MUSLIM
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
I
STILL
SAY
THE
BOSNIANS
ARE
GETTING
THEIR
ASSES
KICKED
THEY
SHOULD
SURRENDER
AND
EVACUATE
THE
AREAS
THEY
CANT
HOLD
I
SAID
THE
FIXATION
ON
BOSNIA
IS
DUE
TO
IT
BEING
IN
A
EUROPEAN
COUNTRY
RATHER
THAN
THE
THIRD
WORLD
I
RECALL
BEFORE
WE
DID
ANYTHING
FOR
SOMALIA
APPARENT
LEFTWINGERS
SAYING
THAT
THE
REASON
EVERYONE
WAS
MORE
WILLING
TO
SEND
TROOPS
TO
BOSNIA
THAN
TO
SOMALIA
WAS
BECAUSE
THE
SOMALIS
ARE
THIRDWORLDERS
WHO
AMERICANS
CONSIDER
UNWORTHY
OF
HELP
THEY
SUDDENLY
SHUT
UP
WHEN
THE
US
DECIDED
TO
SEND
TROOPS
TO
THE
OPPOSITE
PLACE
THAN
THAT
PREDICTED
BY
THE
THEORY
I
AM
A
STAUNCH
REPUBLICAN
BTW
THE
IRONY
OF
ARGUING
AGAINST
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
WITH
ARGUMENTS
BASED
ON
VIETNAM
HAS
NOT
ESCAPED
ME
I
WAS
OPPOSED
TO
US
INTERVENTION
IN
SOMALIA
FOR
THE
SAME
REASONS
ALTHOUGH
CLEARLY
IT
WAS
NOT
NEARLY
AS
RISKY
FOR
THAT
MATTER
THIS
THEORY
OF
YOURS
SUGGESTS
THAT
AMERICANS
SHOULD
WANT
TO
HELP
THE
SERBS
AFTER
ALL
THEYRE
CHRISTIAN
AND
THE
MUSLIMS
ARE
NOT
IF
THE
DESIRE
TO
INTERVENE
IN
BOSNIA
IS
BASED
ON
RACISM
AGAINST
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
LESS
LIKE
US
WHY
DOES
EVERYONE
WANT
TO
HELP
THE
SIDE
THAT
IS
LESS
LIKE
US
ESPECIALLY
IF
BOTH
OF
THE
SIDES
ARE
EQUAL
AS
YOU
SEEM
TO
THINK
WELL
ONE
THING
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMEMBER
IS
THE
PRESS
LIKES
A
GOOD
STORY
GOOD
FOR
BUSINESS
DONT
YOU
KNOW
AND
BTW
NOT
EVERYONE
WANTS
TO
HELP
THE
SIDE
THAT
IS
LESS
LIKE
US
I
NEVER
SAID
THE
TWO
SIDES
WERE
MORALLY
EQUIVALENT
I
SAID
NEITHER
ONE
IS
INNOCENT
THERE
ARE
JUST
TOO
MANY
GOOD
REASONS
TO
STAY
AWAY
THE
EUROPEANS
ARE
PERFECTLY
ABLE
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
DISPUTE
ON
THEIR
BORDERS
IN
ANY
WAY
WE
DO
IT
PUT
ANOTHER
WAY
WE
HAVE
NO
ASSISTANCE
TO
OFFER
THE
EUROPEANS
WHICH
THEY
DO
NOT
ALREADY
POSSESS
THEMSELVES
IT
IS
NOT
GOOD
TO
PROMOTE
THE
IDEA
IN
ANYONES
MIND
THAT
THE
UNITED
STATES
IS
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
CLEANING
UP
EVERY
BLOODY
MESS
IN
THE
WORLD
CLINTON
IS
NOT
THE
MAN
TO
LEAD
THIS
COUNTRY
INTO
A
MILITARY
ADVENTURE
FULL
STOP
IT
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
CLEAR
WHAT
INTERVENTION
WOULD
ACCOMPLISH
NOR
THAT
IT
WOULD
NECESSARILY
HELP
THE
VICTIMS
IT
IS
NOT
CLEAR
WHAT
THE
GOAL
IS
AND
AT
WHAT
POINT
ANY
COMMITMENT
COULD
BE
ENDED
