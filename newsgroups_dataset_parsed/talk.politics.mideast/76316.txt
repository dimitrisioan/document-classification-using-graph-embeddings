IT
WAS
UNDERSTOOD
LATER
THAT
ALL
THESE
WERE
NOTHING
BUT
TRICKS
AND
TRAPS
THE
TURKS
WHO
JOINED
THE

SOON
CHANGED

THEY
ATTEMPTED
TO

HOWEVER
THE

THREATENED
THE
RUSSIAN

BY
VOWING
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
THE

FATE
IF
THEY
INTERVENED
AND
THUS
PREVENTED
THEM
FROM

ALL
THESE

INSTEAD
OF
BEING
HORRIFIED
THE
LIEUTENANT
COLONEL
HAD
SEVERELY
REPRIMANDED
THOSE

FOR
THEIR
INDECENT
BEHAVIOUR
WHEN
HE
TOLD
THE
GIRLS
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
INCLUDING
WOMEN
WERE
GENERALLY
MORE
LICENTIOUS
THAN
EVEN
THE
WILDEST
ANIMALS
AND
THAT
THEIR
INDECENT
AND
SHAMEFUL
LAUGHTER
WAS
THE
MOST
OBVIOUS
EVIDENCE
OF
THEIR
INHUMANITY
AND
BARBARITY
BEFORE
A
SCENE
THAT
APPALLED
EVEN
VETERAN
SOLDIERS
THE
ARMENIAN
GIRLS
FINALLY
REMEMBERED
THEIR
SENSE
OF
SHAME
AND
CLAIMED
THEY
HAD
LAUGHED

THE
GREAT
MASSACRE
IN
ERZURUM
BEGAN
ON
FEBRUARY
THE
ENLISTED
MEN
OF
THE

INTO
THE
BATH
TO
SATISFY
THEIR
LUSTS
PEOPLE
AMONG
THIS
GROUP
WERE
ABLE
TO
SAVE
THEIR
LIVES
AS
THE
RESULT
OF
MY
DECISIVE
ATTEMPTS
THE
OTHERS
THE
ARMENIANS
CLAIMED
WERE
RELEASED
WHEN
THEY
LEARNT
THAT
I
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
ORGANIZED
THIS
TREACHEROUS
ACT
WAS
THE
ENVOY
TO
THE
ARMENIAN
OFFICERS
KARAGODAVIEV
TODAY
SOME

WERE
MURDERED
ON
THE
STREETS
ON

MORE
THAN
TEN
INNOCENT
MOSLEMS
THE
RUSSIAN
SOLDIERS
WHO
ATTEMPTED
TO

THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
THREATENED
WITH

MEANWHILE
I
IMPRISONED
AN
ARMENIAN
FOR
MURDERING
AN
INNOCENT
TURK
WHEN
AN
ARMENIAN
OFFICER
TOLD
AN
ARMENIAN
MURDERER
THAT
HE
WOULD
BE
HANGED
FOR
HIS
CRIME
THE
KILLER
SHOUTED
FURIOUSLY
HOW
DARE
YOU
HANG
AN
ARMENIAN
FOR
KILLING
A
TURK
IN
ERZURUM
THE
ARMENIANS
BURNED
DOWN
THE
TURKISH
MARKET
ON
FEBRUARY
I
HEARD
THAT
THE
ENTIRE
POPULATION
OF
TEPEKOY
VILLAGE
SITUATED
WITHIN
THE
ARTILLERY
AREA
HAD
BEEN
TOTALLY
ANNIHILATED
ON
THE
SAME
DAY
WHEN
ANTRANIK
ENTERED
ERZURUM
I
REPORTED
THE
MASSACRE
TO
HIM
AND
ASKED
HIM
TO
TRACK
DOWN
THE
PERPETRATORS
OF
THIS
HORRIBLE
ACT
HOWEVER
NO
RESULT
WAS
ACHIEVED
IN
THE
VILLAGES
WHOSE
INHABITANTS
HAD
BEEN
MASSACRED
THERE
WAS
A
NATURAL
SILENCE
ON
THE
NIGHT
OF
FEBRUARY
THE
ARMENIANS
DECEIVED
THE
RUSSIANS
PERPETRATED
A
MASSACRE
AND
ESCAPED
FOR
FEAR
OF
THE
TURKISH
SOLDIERS
LATER
IT
WAS
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
THIS
MASSACRE
HAD
BEEN
BASED
UPON
A
METHOD
ORGANIZED
AND
PLANNED
IN
A
CIRCULAR
THE
POPULATION
HAD
BEEN
HERDED
IN
A
CERTAIN
PLACE
AND
THEN
KILLED
ONE
BY
ONE
THE
NUMBER
OF
MURDERS
COMMITTED
ON
THAT
NIGHT
REACHED
THREE
THOUSAND
IT
WAS
THE
ARMENIANS
WHO
BRAGGED
TO
ABOUT
THE
DETAILS
OF
THE
MASSACRE
THE
ARMENIANS
FIGHTING
AGAINST
THE
TURKISH
SOLDIERS
WERE
SO
FEW
IN
NUMBER
AND
SO
COWARDLY
THAT
THEY
COULD
NOT
EVEN
WITHSTAND
THE
TURKISH
SOLDIERS
WHO
CONSISTED
OF
ONLY
FIVE
HUNDRED
PEOPLE
AND
TWO
CANNONS
FOR
ONE
NIGHT
AND
RAN
AWAY
THE
LEADING
ARMENIANS
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
COULD
HAVE
PREVENTED
THIS
MASSACRE
HOWEVER
THE
ARMENIAN
INTELLECTUALS
HAD
SHARED
THE
SAME
IDEAS
WITH
THE
RENEGADES
IN
THIS
MASSACRE
JUST
AS
IN
ALL
THE
OTHERS
THE
LOWER
CLASSES
WITHIN
THE
ARMENIAN
COMMUNITY
HAVE
ALWAYS
OBEYED
THE
ORDERS
OF
THE
LEADING
ARMENIAN
FIGURES
AND
COMMANDERS
I
DO
NOT
LIKE
TO
GIVE
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
ALL
ARMENIAN
INTELLECTUALS
WERE
ACCESSORIES
TO
THESE
MURDERS
NO
FOR
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
WHO
OPPOSED
THE
ARMENIANS
FOR
SUCH
ACTIONS
SINCE
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
THAT
IT
WOULD
YIELD
NO
RESULT
HOWEVER
SUCH
PEOPLE
WERE
ONLY
A
MINORITY
FURTHERMORE
SUCH
PEOPLE
WERE
CONSIDERED
AS
TRAITORS
TO
THE
ARMENIAN
CAUSE
SOME
HAVE
SEEMINGLY
OPPOSED
THE
ARMENIAN
MURDERS
BUT
HAVE
SUPPORTED
THE
MASSACRES
SECRETLY
SOME
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
PREFERRED
TO
REMAIN
SILENT
THERE
WERE
CERTAIN
OTHERS
WHO
WHEN
ACCUSED
BY
THE
RUSSIANS
OF
INFAMY
WOULD
SAY
THE
FOLLOWING
YOU
ARE
RUSSIANS
YOU
CAN
NEVER
UNDERSTAND
THE
ARMENIAN
CAUSE
THE
ARMENIANS
HAD
A
CONSCIENCE
THEY
WOULD
COMMIT
MASSACRES
AND
THEN
WOULD
FLEE
IN
FEAR
OF
THE
TURKISH
SOLDIERS
SERDAR
ARGIC
WE
CLOSED
THE
ROADS
AND
MOUNTAIN

THAT
MIGHT
SERVE
AS
