WRITES
IF
I
DECIDED
TO
GO
BACK
TO
THE
LAND
FROM
WHICH
MY
RELATIVES
HAD
BEEN
EXPELLED
YEARS
AGO
BUT
FIRST
I
CONVERT
TO
ANY
OTHER
RELIGION
CAN
I
APPLY
TO
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
AS
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
OR
SHOULD
I
APPLY
AS
SOMEONE
WHOSE
MOTHER
IS
JEWISH
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
BUT
I
HOPE
THE
ANSWER
IS
THAT
YOU
CANT
APPLY
UNDER
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
BY
CONVERSION
YOUVE
ELECTED
NOT
TO
BE
A
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
WHICH
WAS
MY
POINT
BY
CONVERTING
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
I
DO
NOT
LOOSE
MY
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
I
JUST
LOOSE
MY
RELIGIOUS
IDENTIFICATION
I
CONSIDER
THAT
DEFINING
THE
BELONGING
TO
A
NATION
THAT
CLAIMS
THE
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
A
STATE
BASED
ON
RELIGIOUS
BELIEF
IS
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
WHAT
HAS
CHANGE
IN
ME
BETWEEN
THE
DAY
BEFORE
AND
THE
DAY
AFTER
I
CONVERTED
TO
LOOSE
MY
BEING
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
AT
THE
MOMENT
YOU
CONVERTED
YOU
OFFICIALLY
ANOUNCED
TO
THE
WORLD
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
YOURSELF
TO
BE
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
SO
WHY
SHOULD
THE
JEWISH
NATION
CONSIDER
YOU
TO
BE
A
MEMBER
TO
BE
A
PART
OR
NOT
OF
THE
JEISH
NATION
IS
DEFINED
BY
MY
CULTURE
AND
NOT
BY
MY
RELIGION
ACTUALLY
IF
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
WHICH
IS
IN
FACT
LIKE
CONVERTING
INTO
A
NONJEWISH
IN
TERMS
OF
RELIGION
I
AM
STILL
CONSIDERED
AS
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
I
CAN
BE
PROUD
OF
MY
JEWISH
CULTURE
WHILE
NOT
GIVING
ANY
IMPORTANCE
TO
THE
JEWISH
RELIGION
OR
EVEN
MORE
I
CAN
BE
PROUD
OF
MY
JEWISH
CULTURE
WHILE
STILL
BE
CONVINCED
THAT
THE
REAL
GOD
IS
ANOTHER
ONE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
ANYONE
WHO
LOST
HIS
MEMEBERSHIP
TO
THE
AMERICAN
NATION
BECAUSE
HE
CHANGED
OF
GOD
SUPPOSE
MY
FATHER
IS
ARAB
SUPPOSE
HE
WAS
BORN
IN
PALESTINE
IN
SOME
PLACE
WHICH
NOW
IS
PART
OF
ISRAEL
SUPPOSE
THAT
HIS
FATHER
AND
HIS
GRANDFATHER
AS
WELL
AS
OR
GENERATIONS
BEFORE
HIM
WERE
BORN
IN
THAT
PLACE
NOW
SUPPOSE
THERE
IS
A
WAR
OF
INDEPENDENCE
AND
MY
FATHER
SCARED
BY
ALL
THE
FIGHTING
GOING
ON
TRIES
TO
TAKE
HIS
FAMILY
TO
A
PLACE
MORE
SECURE
AMONG
PEOPLE
HE
KNOWS
WHO
SPEAK
A
LANGUAGE
HE
UNDERSTANDS
WHO
WORSHIP
THE
SAME
GOD
NOW
SUPPOSE
THAT
THAT
PLACE
IS
SOME
OTHER
ARAB
COUNTRY
AND
NOW
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
WAR
IS
OVER
AND
THAT
THERE
IS
A
NEW
COUNTRY
CREATED
WHERE
MY
FATHER
USED
TO
LIVE
AND
THAT
THAT
COUNTRY
IS
CALLED
ISRAEL
AND
THAT
IN
THAT
COUNTRY
JEWS
FROM
ALL
OVER
THE
WORLD
ARE
RECEIVED
AND
THAT
PEOPLE
WHOSE
FAMILY
LEFT
THET
COUNTRY
GENERATION
AGO
ARE
RECIEVED
AND
GRANTED
FULLCITIZENSHIP
SHOULD
I
IF
I
DECIDED
TO
GO
BACK
TO
MY
FATHERS
LAND
WHERE
HE
WAS
BORN
AS
OR
GENERATIONS
OF
MY
FAMILY
WERE
BORN
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
GO
BACK
AND
ASK
TO
BE
RECOGNIZED
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
RETURNING
AFTER
YEARS
NO
AS
A
RESULT
OF
WARS
BROUGHT
BY
THE
ARABS
AGAINST
THE
JEWS
IN
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
ANNIHILATE
ISRAEL
THE
ARABS
HAVE
LOST
THEIR
CLAIM
TO
LAND
THERE
ATTACKING
ISRAEL
ISWAS
ILLEGAL
AND
THEY
NOW
HAVE
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
DO
I
FEEL
SORRY
FOR
THE
PALESTINIANS
YES
I
DO
BUT
I
BLAME
THE
ARAB
NATIONS
FOR
THEIR
PROBLEMS
NOT
ISRAEL
I
STILL
BELIEVE
THAT
WE
SHOULD
NEVER
CONFUSSE
THE
ACTIONS
OF
STATES
WITH
THE
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
HAPPEN
TO
LIVE
THERE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
THAT
I
DO
NOT
THINK
IT
IS
RIGHT
TO
BLAME
ALL
ISRAELIS
FOR
THE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
OF
ISRAEL
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
WE
SHOULD
ASSUME
THAT
ALL
ARABS
ARE
GUILTY
OF
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
ARAB
STATES
SOME
PEOPLE
FLED
THEIR
HOMES
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
SCARED
NOW
THEY
ARE
IN
THERE
STILL
SUFFERING
FOR
WHAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
RESPONSIBLE
AND
REMEMBER
THAT
WE
ALSO
WERE
TOLD
THE
SAME
AT
SOME
POINT
WE
ENDED
IN
THE
DIASPORA
AND
OF
COURSE
I
AM
NOT
FOR
DOING
TO
OTHERS
WHAT
I
DID
NOT
WANT
DONE
TO
ME
