ISRAEL
IN

WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
CPRIGCAPCORG
CENTER
FOR
POLICY
RESEARCH
WRITES
IS
IT
TRUE
THAT
IN
ISRAELI
PRISONS
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
INDIVIDUALS
WHICH
WERE
TRIED
IN
SECRET
AND
FOR
WHICH
THEIR
IDENTITIES
THE
DATE
OF
THEIR
TRIAL
AND
THEIR
IMPRISONMENT
ARE
STATE
SECRETS
APART
FROM
MORDECHAI
VANUNU
WHO
HAD
A
TRIAL
BEHIND
CLOSED
DOORS
THERE
WAS
ONE
OTHER
ESPIONAGE
CASE
THE
NUTTY
PROFESSOR
AT
THE
NES
ZIONA
BIOLOGICAL
INSTITUTE
WHO
WAS
A
KGB
MOLE
WHO
WAS
TRIED
IN
CAMERA
I
WOULDNT
EXACTLY
CALL
IT
A
STATE
SECRET
THE
TRIAL
WAS
SIMPLY
TRIED
BEHIND
CLOSED
DOORS
I
HATE
TO
DISAPPOINT
YOU
BUT
THE
UNITED
STATES
HAS
TRIED
A
NUMBER
OF
ESPIONAGE
CASES
IN
CAMERA
AT
ISSUE
WAS
NOT
A
TRIAL
BEHIND
CLOSED
DOORS
BUT
ARREST
TRIAL
AND
IMPRISONMENT
IN
COMPLETE
SECRECY
THIS
WAS
APPRAENTLY
ATTEMPTED
IN
THE
CASE
OF
VANUNU
AND
FAILED
IT
HAS
HAPPENED
BEFORE
AND
THERE
IS
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
IT
STILL
GOES
ON
READ
THIS
FROM
MAARIV
FEBRUARY
POSSIBLY
PUBLICATION
BAN
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
HAS
NEVER
OFFICIALLY
ADMITTED
THAT
FOR
MANY
YEARS
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
IN
ITS
PRISONS
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
WHO
WERE
SENTENCED
TO
LONG
PRISON
TERMS
WITHOUT
EITHER
THE
FACT
OF
THEIR
ARREST
OR
THE
CRIMES
OF
WHICH
THEY
WERE
ACCUSED
EVER
BEING
MADE
PUBLIC
BY
BARUCH
MEIRI
ALL
THOSE
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
MATTER
POLITELY
REFUSED
MY
REQUEST
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
LOOK
THE
SUBJECT
IS
TOO
DELICATE
IF
I
COMMENT
ON
IT
I
WILL
BE
IMPLICITLY
ADMITTING
THAT
IT
IS
TRUE
IF
I
MENTION
A
SPECIFIC
CASE
EVEN
HINT
AT
IT
I
MIGHT
BE
GUILTY
OF
MAKING
PUBLIC
SOMETHING
WHICH
MAY
LEGALLY
NOT
BE
PUBLISHED
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
HAS
NEVER
OFFICIALLY
ADMITTED
THAT
FOR
MANY
YEARS
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
IN
ITS
PRISONS
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
WHO
WERE
SENTENCED
TO
LONG
PRISON
TERMS
WITHOUT
EITHER
THE
FACT
OF
THEIR
ARREST
OR
THE
CRIMES
OF
WHICH
THEY
WERE
ACCUSED
EVER
BEING
MADE
PUBLIC
MORE
PRECISELY
A
COURT
ORDERED
PUBLICATION
BAN
WAS
PLACED
ON
THE
FACT
OF
THEIR
ARREST
AND
LATER
ON
THEIR
IMPRISONMENT
IN
ISRAEL
OF
CITIZENS
ARE
IMPRISONED
WITHOUT
US
THE
CITIZENS
OF
THIS
COUNTRY
KNOWING
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
NOT
KNOWING
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
FACT
THAT
ONE
PERSON
OR
ANOTHER
WERE
TRIED
AND
THROWN
IN
PRISON
FOR
SECURITY
OFFENSES
IN
COMPLETE
SECRECY
IN
THE
DISTANT
PAST
FOR
EXAMPLE
DURING
THE
DAYS
OF
THE
LAVON
YA
AFFAIR
WE
HEARD
ABOUT
THE
THIRD
MAN
BEING
IN
PRISON
BUT
MANY
YEARS
HAVE
PASSED
SINCE
THEN
AND
WHAT
EXISTED
THEN
CAN
TODAY
NO
LONGER
BE
FOUND
EVEN
IN
SOUTH
AMERICAN
COUNTRIES
OR
IN
THE
FORMER
COMMUNIST
COUNTRIES
BUT
IT
APPEARS
THAT
THIS
IS
STILL
POSSIBLE
IN
ISRAEL
OF
THE
CHAIR
OF
THE
KNESSET
COMMITTEE
ON
LAW
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
JUSTICE
MK
DAVID
ZUCKER
SENT
A
LETTER
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
EARLY
THIS
WEEK
TO
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
THE
MINISTER
OF
JUSTICE
AND
THE
CABINET
LEGAL
ADVISOR
MAARIV
HAS
OBTAINED
THE
CONTENT
OF
THE
LETTER
DURING
THE
PAST
SEVERAL
YEARS
A
NUMBER
OF
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
HAVE
BEEN
IMPRISONED
FOR
VARIOUS
PERIODS
FOR
SECURITY
OFFENSES
IN
SOME
OF
THESE
CASES
A
LEGAL
PUBLICATION
BAN
WAS
IMPOSED
NOT
ONLY
ON
THE
SPECIFICS
OF
THE
CRIMES
FOR
WHICH
THE
PRISONERS
WERE
CONVICTED
BUT
EVEN
ON
THE
MERE
FACT
OF
THEIR
IMPRISONMENT
IN
THOSE
CASES
AFTER
BEING
LEGALLY
CONVICTED
THE
PRISONERS
SPEND
THEIR
TERM
IN
PRISON
WITHOUT
PUBLIC
AWARENESS
EITHER
OF
THE
IMPRISONMENT
OR
OF
THE
PRISONER
ASSERTS
MK
ZUCKER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
ZUCKER
AGREES
IN
HIS
LETTER
THAT
THERE
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NO
QUESTION
THAT
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
AND
IN
SOME
CASES
IT
IS
IMPERATIVE
THAT
A
PUBLICATION
BAN
BE
IMPOSED
ON
THE
SPECIFICS
OF
SECURITY
OFFENSES
AND
THE
COURSE
OF
TRIALS
BUT
EVEN
IN
SUCH
CASES
THE
COURT
MUST
WEIGH
CAREFULLY
AND
DELIBERATELY
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
UNDER
WHICH
A
TRIAL
WILL
NOT
BE
HELD
IN
PUBLIC
HOWEVER
ONE
MUST
ASK
WHETHER
THE
IMPOSITION
OF
A
PUBLICATION
BAN
ON
THE
MERE
FACT
OF
A
PERSONS
ARREST
AND
ON
THE
NAME
OF
A
PERSON
SENTENCED
TO
PRISON
IS
JUSTIFIED
AND
APPROPRIATE
IN
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
PUBLIC
TRIAL
AND
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PUBLIC
TO
KNOW
ARE
NOT
CONSISTENT
WITH
THE
DISAPPEARANCE
OF
A
PERSON
FROM
PUBLIC
SIGHT
AND
HIS
DESCENT
INTO
THE
ABYSS
OF
PRISON
ZUCKER
THUS
DECIDED
TO
TURN
TO
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
THE
MINISTER
OF
JUSTICE
AND
THE
CABINET
LEGAL
ADVISOR
AND
REQUEST
THAT
THEY
CONSIDER
THE
QUESTION
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
IS
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
WITHSTAND
THE
COST
INCURRED
BY
ABIDING
BY
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
PUBLIC
PUNISHMENT
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
CANNOT
BE
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
PRISONERS
WHOSE
DETENTION
AND
ITS
CAUSE
IS
KEPT
SECRET
WROTE
ZUCKER
THE
LEGAL
COUNSEL
OF
THE
CIVIL
RIGHTS
UNION
ATTORNEY
MORDECHAI
SHIFFMAN
SAID
THAT
WE
AS
THE
CIVIL
RIGHTS
UNION
DO
NOT
KNOW
OF
ANY
CASES
OF
SECURITY
PRISONERS
CITIZENS
OF
ISRAEL
WHO
ARE
IMPRISONED
AND
WHOSE
IMPRISONMENT
CANNOT
BE
MADE
PUBLIC
THIS
IS
A
SITUATION
WHICH
IF
IT
ACTUALLY
EXISTS
IS
DEFINITELY
UNHEALTHY
JUST
LIKE
CENSORSHIP
IS
AN
UNHEALTHY
MATTER
THE
UNION
IS
AWARE
SAYS
SHIFFMAN
OF
CASES
WHERE
NOTIFICATION
OF
A
SUSPECTS
ARREST
TO
FAMILY
MEMBERS
AND
LAWYERS
IS
WITHHELD
I
AM
SPEAKING
ONLY
OF
SEVERAL
DAYS
I
KNOW
ALSO
OF
CASES
WHERE
A
DETAINEE
WAS
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
MEET
WITH
AN
ATTORNEY
SOMETIMES
FOR
THE
WHOLE
FIRST
MONTH
OF
ARREST
THAT
IS
DONE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
GREAT
SECRECY
THE
SUSPECT
HIMSELF
HIS
FAMILY
HIS
LAWYER
OR
EVEN
A
JOURNALIST
CAN
CHALLENGE
THE
PUBLICATION
BAN
IN
COURT
BUT
THERE
ARE
CASES
WHERE
THE
FAMILY
MEMBERS
THEMSELVES
ARE
NOT
INTERESTED
IN
PUBLICITY
THE
JOURNALIST
KNOWS
NOTHING
OF
THE
ARREST
AND
SO
ALMOST
EVERYONE
IS
HAPPY
ATTORNEY
YOSSI
ARNON
AN
OFFICIAL
OF
THE
BAR
CLAIMS
THAT
GIVEN
THE
LAWS
AS
THEY
EXIST
IN
ISRAEL
TODAY
A
SITUATION
WHERE
THE
ARREST
OF
A
PERSON
FOR
SECURITY
OFFENSES
IS
KEPT
SECRET
IS
DEFINITELY
POSSIBLE
NOTHING
IS
EASIER
THE
COURT
ORDERS
A
PUBLICATION
BAN
AND
THATS
THAT
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
COMMITTED
SECURITY
OFFENSES
CAN
SPEND
LONG
YEARS
IN
PRISON
WITHOUT
US
KNOWING
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
DO
YOU
FIND
THIS
SITUATION
ACCEPTABLE
ATTORNEY
ARNON
DEFINITELY
NOT
WE
LIVE
IN
A
DEMOCRATIC
COUNTRY
AND
SUCH
A
STATE
OF
AFFAIRS
IS
IMPERMISSIBLE
I
AM
WELL
AWARE
THAT
PUBLICATION
CAN
BE
DAMAGING
FROM
THE
STANDPOINT
OF
SECURITY
BUT
TOTAL
NONPUBLICATION
SILENCE
IS
UNACCEPTABLE
CONSIDER
THE
TRIAL
OF
MORDECHAI
VANUNU
AT
LEAST
IN
HIS
CASE
WE
KNOW
THAT
HE
WAS
CHARGED
WITH
AGGRAVATED
ESPIONAGE
AND
SENTENCED
TO
YEARS
IN
PRISON
THE
TRIAL
WAS
HELD
BEHIND
CLOSED
DOORS
NOBODY
KNEW
THE
DETAILS
EXCEPT
FOR
THOSE
WHO
WERE
AUTHORIZED
TO
IT
IS
SOMEHOW
POSSIBLE
TO
UNDERSTAND
THOUGH
NOT
TO
ACCEPT
THE
REASONS
BUT
AS
I
HAVE
NOTED
WE
AT
LEAST
ARE
AWARE
OF
HIS
IMPRISONMENT
WHY
IS
THE
MATTER
ACTUALLY
THAT
SERIOUS
CANT
WE
TRUST
THE
DISCRETION
OF
THE
COURT
ATTORNEY
ARNON
THE
JUDGES
HAVE
NO
CHOICE
BUT
TO
TRUST
THE
PRESENTATIONS
MADE
TO
THEM
THE
JUDGES
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE
TOOLS
TO
INVESTIGATE
THIS
GIVES
THE
GOVERNMENT
ENORMOUS
POWER
POWER
WHICH
THEY
CAN
MISUSE
AND
WHAT
IF
THERE
REALLY
IS
A
SECURITY
ISSUE
ATTORNEY
ARNON
I
AM
A
MAN
OF
THE
LEGAL
SYSTEM
NOT
A
SECURITY
EXPERT
DEMOCRACY
STANDS
IN
OPPOSITION
TO
SECURITY
I
BELIEVE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
PUBLICIZE
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
ARREST
AND
THE
CHARGES
WITHOUT
ENTERING
INTO
DETAIL
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
SEEN
HOW
THE
LAWS
CONCERNING
PUBLICATION
BANS
CAN
BE
MISUSED
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
RACHEL
HELLER
MURDER
A
SUSPECT
IN
THE
MURDER
WAS
HELD
FOR
MANY
MONTHS
WITHOUT
THE
MATTER
BEING
MADE
PUBLIC
ATTORNEY
SHIFFMAN
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
BELIEVES
THAT
STATE
SECURITY
CAN
BE
A
LEGITIMATE
REASON
FOR
PROHIBITING
PUBLICATION
OF
A
SUSPECTS
ARREST
OR
OF
A
CONVICTED
CRIMINALS
IMPRISONMENT
A
HEALTHY
SITUATION
DEFINITELY
NOT
BUT
I
AM
AWARE
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
MERE
PUBLICATION
MAY
BE
HARMFUL
TO
STATE

CLEARLY
WE

ISOLATED
SPECIAL

SUCH
SITUATIONS
CONTRAST
WITH
THE
PRINCIPLE
THAT
A

PROCEEDING
MUST

NO

THIS
CONTRADICTS
THE

DEFINITELY
