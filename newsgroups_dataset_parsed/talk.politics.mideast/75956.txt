i
have
nothing
against
greeks
but
my
problem
is
with
fanatics
i
have
met
so
many
greeks
who
wouldnt
even
talk
to
me
because
i
am
turkish
from
my
experience
all
my
friends
always
were
open
to
greeks
well
the
history
wars
current
situations
all
of
them
do
not
help
well
panos
mr
tamamidis
the
way
you
put
it
it
is
only
the
turks
who
bear
the
responsibility
of
the
things
happening
today
that
is
hard
to
believe
for
somebody
trying
to
be
objective
well
if
you
put
things
into
historical
perspective
the
turks
moved
into
an
area
which
was
inhabited
by
greeks
this
is
how
the
history
between
the
two
nations
started
some
centuries
ago
since
then
it
has
been
a
continuous
battle
between
the
two
nations
from
my
perspective
i
cant
see
why
i
should
say
that
greeks
have
been
responsible
for
what
has
happened
between
the
two
nations
of
course
it
would
not
be
reasonable
to
argue
that
the
hostility
should
drag
till
we
kick
the
turks
out
of
this
area
this
isnt
going
to
happen
so
the
best
would
be
to
improve
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
a
golden
oportunity
exists
with
cyprus
if
things
cant
work
there
there
isnt
any
possible
way
that
could
work
between
our
nations
when
it
comes
to
conflicts
like
our
countries
having
you
cannot
blame
one
side
only
there
always
are
bad
guys
on
both
sides
what
were
you
doing
on
anatolia
after
the
anyway
do
you
think
it
was
your
right
to
be
there
i
always
avoid
to
discuss
such
things
i
consider
it
a
waist
of
my
time
besides
as
i
said
i
do
not
want
to
open
a
new
flame
i
am
not
saying
that
conflicts
started
with
that
it
is
only
not
one
side
being
the
aggressive
and
the
ither
always
suffering
it
is
sad
that
we
both
still
are
not
trying
to
compromise
i
remember
the
action
of
the
turkish
government
by
removing
the
visa
requirement
for
greeks
to
come
to
turkey
i
thought
it
was
a
positive
attempt
to
make
the
relations
better
i
thought
it
was
a
smart
move
to
receive
more
money
from
greek
tourists
i
bet
that
this
week
there
should
be
about
tourists
from
greece
in
turkey
each
one
will
leave
at
least
so
go
and
figure
what
this
means
to
your
economy
if
you
had
kept
the
visa
requirement
how
many
greeks
would
bother
to
visit
turkey
the
greeks
i
mentioned
who
wouldnt
talk
to
me
are
educated
people
they
have
never
met
me
but
they
know
i
am
bad
person
because
i
am
from
turkey
politics
is
not
my
business
and
it
is
not
the
business
of
most
of
the
turks
when
it
comes
to
individuals
why
the
hatred
come
on
do
not
extrapolate
from
your
limited
personal
experience
you
err
if
you
think
youd
get
a
reasonable
conclusion
