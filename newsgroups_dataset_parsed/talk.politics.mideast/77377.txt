DAVE
BAKKEN
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
BENALIALCORCONCORDIACA
ILYESS
B
BDIRA
WRITES
SO
HOW
WOULD
HAVE
YOU
DEFENDED
SAUDI
ARABIA
AND
ROLLED
BACK
THE
IRAQI
INVASION
WERE
YOU
IN
CHARGE
OF
SAUDI
ARABIA
ALL
MUSLIMS
KNEW
THAT
THE
WHOLE
THING
WAS
SET
UP
TO
DESTROY
IRAQ
NOT
TO
LIBERATE
KUWAIT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
KILLED
BY
THE
INVASION
ARE
MORE
MANY
MANY
MORE
THAN
THE
ONES
THAT
WERE
KILLED
BY
THE
IRAQIS
IN
THEIR
SMALLER
INVASION
I
LIVED
IN
THE
WEST
AND
I
HAVE
SEEN
HOW
YOUR
MEDIA
PREPARED
YOU
HELPLESS
NAIVE
AMERICANS
FOR
A
WAR
AGAINST
IRAQ
EVEN
BEFORE
THE
ARTIFICIAL
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
IRAQ
AND
KUWAIT
THAT
LED
TO
THE
INVASION
AS
THE
CIA
CORRECTLY
PREDICTED
AND
PRETENDED
TO
BE
SURPRISED
NOT
TO
KNOW
IT
JUST
HAPPENED
THAT
SADDAM
WAS
SO
PREDICTIBLE
AND
SO
ARROGANT
AND
STUPID
WHAT
WOULD
I
HAVE
DONE
MOST
MUSLIMS
WOULD
CHOOSE
DEAD
KUWAITIS
OVER
DEAD
IRAQIS
AND
DEAD
KUWAITIS
THE
FIRST
CASE
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
NO
WESTERN
INTERVENTION
HAPPENED
AND
THE
SECOND
CASE
WAS
A
DIRECT
OR
INDIRECT
RESULT
OF
WESTERN
ENVOLVEMENT
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IN
KUWAIT
WHAT
ABOUT
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IN
IRAQ
WHY
THE
WEST
GAVE
SADDAM
A
GREEN
LIGHT
TO
SLAUGHTER
HIS
OWN
PEOPLE
I
WILL
GIVE
MY
REASON
BECAUSE
THE
RICH
KUWAITIS
DO
NOT
MIND
TO
BE
YOUR
SALVES
SO
THEY
DESERVE
SOME
DEMOCRACY
BUT
IRAQIS
MIGHT
NOT
SO
THEY
DONT
AS
SIMPLE
AS
THAT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
YOU
WANT
TO
ADMIT
IT
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
A
VERY
GOOD
IDEA
TO
NOT
HAVE
GOVERNMENTS
HAVE
AN
OFFICIAL
RELIGION
DE
FACTO
OR
DE
JURE
BECAUSE
WITH
HUMAN
NATURE
LIKE
IT
IS
THE
AMBITIOUS
AND
NOT
THE
PIOUS
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
THE
ONES
WHO
RISE
TO
POWER
THERE
ARE
JUST
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
IN
THIS
WORLD
OR
ANY
COUNTRY
FOR
THE
CITIZENS
TO
REALLY
KNOW
IF
A
LEADER
IS
REALLY
DEVOUT
OR
IF
HE
IS
JUST
A
SLICK
OPERATOR
NOT
NECESSARILY
THE
BEST
SOLUTION
MY
VIEW
OF
AN
ISLAMIC
STATE
AND
THAT
OF
TURABI
THAT
YOUR
MEDIA
MADE
YOU
HATE
INCLUDES
ALL
THE
BENEFITS
OF
A
SECULAR
STATE
MINUS
THE
INJUSTICES
DID
YOU
EVER
READ
A
BOOK
BY
RASHID
ALGHANNOUSHI
TUNISIA
HASSAN
TURABI
SUDAN
YOU
ONLY
KNOW
ABOUT
THEM
FROM
YOUR
SELFCENSURED
SELFCONTROLLED
MEDIA
IF
THEY
MAKE
THIS
KIND
OF
CAMPAIGN
AGAINST
SUCH
A
MODERATE
THINKER
AS
TURABI
IS
AND
KEEP
QUITE
ABOUT
SUCH
AN
EXTREMIST
MUSLIM
SCHOLAR
AS
BIN
BEZ
OF
SAUDI
ARABIA
IS
IT
JUST
DOES
NOT
ENCOURAGE
ANY
MODERATION
IN
OUR
ARAB
WORLD
YOU
MAKE
IT
SOUND
LIKE
THESE
GUYS
ARE
ANGELS
ILYESS
IN
YOUR
CLARINET
POSTING
YOU
EDITED
OUT
SOME
STUFF
WAS
IT
THE
FOLLOWING
NO
IT
WAS
NOT
THAT
IT
WAS
JUST
SOME
IRRELEVENT
STUFF
THAT
I
TOOK
OUT
TO
GO
AROUND
THE
COPYRIGHT
I
CEASED
TO
TAKE
THE
NEWYORK
TIMES
SERIOUSLY
IN
ISSUES
CONCERNING
ISLAM
IT
HAS
BECOME
ONE
OF
THE
BIGGEST
ENEMIES
ALTHOUGH
LESS
THAN
THE
OTHER
NEWYORK
DAILY
SINCE
MORTIMER
TOOK
IT
OVER
IT
LIES
SELECTS
FACTS
THAT
FITS
ITS
AGENDA
AND
EVEN
PRINTS
RACIST
AND
OPEN
ANTIMUSLIM
EDITORIALS
WHAT
THEY
CLAIMED
IN
THAT
ARTICLES
IS
A
BUNCH
OF
LIES
BECAUSE
WHILE
THE
SELECTED
FACTS
ARE
TRUE
ABOUT
SOME
OF
THOSE
PERSONS
THE
OTHER
MEMBERS
ARE
ACTUALLY
DEFENCE
LAWYERS
AND
UNIVERSITY
SCIENCE
PROFESSORS
WHO
WANTED
TO
FIGHT
CORRUPTION
UNCOVER
ATROCITIES
AGAINST
OPPOSITION
ACTIVISTS
AND
SHIA
MINORITY
AND
GENERALLY
INCREASE
AWARENESS
ABOUT
THE
RIGHTS
OF
ALL
CITIZENS
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
IS
COMMON
BETWEEN
THOSE
PEOPLE
IS
THEIR
CONCERN
FOR
THE
DETERIORATION
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
SINCE
THE
SAUDI
CLAN
TOOK
A
GREEN
LIGHT
FROM
AMERICA
AFTER
THE
GULF
TO
DO
WHATEVER
IS
NECESSARY
TO
STAY
IN
POWER
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
ALL
OF
THE
SAUDI
ULEMA
HAVE
BEEN
TAUGHT
THE
SAME
THINGS
THE
ONES
IN
THE
OFFICIAL
IFTAA
ARE
AS
CONSERVATIVE
AS
THE
ONES
THAT
ARE
OPPOSING
IT
SOME
OF
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
COMMITTE
ARE
MORE
PROWOMEN
AND
WANTED
TO
DEFEND
THEM
AND
THAT
IS
PRECISELY
ONE
REASON
THAT
BIN
BEZS
FATWAH
IMPLIED
FOR
THE
ILLEGALITY
OF
THIS
COMMITTEE
AND
FOR
HIS
CLAIM
THAT
IT
REPRESENTS
OUTSIDE
INTERESTS
THERE
IS
A
HUMAN
RIGHTS
ISSUE
IN
SAUDI
ARABIA
AND
YOU
AND
NY
TIMES
CHOSE
TO
IGNORE
THE
MAIN
ISSUE
AND
SELECT
SOME
OF
THE
MEMBERS
OF
THAT
COMMITTEE
AND
ACTUALLY
DEFEND
THE
ACTIONS
DONE
AGAINST
THEM
INCLUDING
BANNING
THEM
FROM
THEIR
JOBS
WHAT
A
HYPOCRICY
I
AM
NOT
SURPRISED
REALLY
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
FIRST
TIME
THE
OFFICIAL
ULEMA
ARE
THE
MOST
EXTREMIST
ANTIWOMEN
MEATHEADS
IN
SAUDI
ARABIA
THE
WEST
CONTINUES
ON
ITS
CAMPAIGN
TO
DISCREDIT
ITSELF
IN
THE
MUSLIM
COMMUNITY
BY
SUPPORTING
THEM
WELL
AFTER
BOSNIA
I
GUESS
IT
HAS
ZERO
CREDIBILITY
TO
BEGIN
WITH
SO
WHAT
THE
HECK
IDHA
LAM
TASTAHI
FAFAAL
MA
SHIIT
IF
YOU
FEEL
NO
SHAME
THEN
DO
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
HADITH
ACTUALLY
A
BETTER
TRANSLATION
OF
THE
MEANING
WOULD
BE
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
FEEL
ASHAMED
FROM
GOD
YOU
WILL
DO
WHATEVER
YOU
WANT
