MOST
PEOPLE
ARENT
AWARE
THAT
IN

SAID
THAT
HE
WOULD
PATTERN
HIS
ELIMINATION
OF
THE

BASED
UPON

FORGOTTEN

IT
DOES
NOT
SERVE
OUR
SOCIETY
WELL
WHEN
MOST
PEOPLE
ARE
TOTALLY
UNAWARE
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
WHERE
A
VICIOUS
SOCIETY
RUN
BY
FASCIST
ARMENIANS
DECIDED
TO
SIMPLY
USE
THE
PHONIEST
OF

AS
AN
EXCUSE
FOR
WIPING
OUT
A
PEACELOVING
INDUSTRIOUS
AND
VERY
INTELLIGENT
AND
PRODUCTIVE
ETHNIC
GROUP
WHAT
WE
HAVE
IS
A
DEMAND
FROM
THE
FASCIST
GOVERNMENT
OF
XSOVIET
ARMENIA
TO
REDRESS
THE
WRONGS
THAT
WERE
DONE
AGAINST
OUR
PEOPLE
AND
THE
ONLY
WAY
WE
CAN
DO
THAT
IS
IF
WE
CAN
CATCH
HOLD
OF
AND
NOT
LOSE
SIGHT
OF
THE
HISTORICAL
PRECEDENCE
IN
THIS
VERY
CENTURY
WE
CANNOT
REVERSE
THE
EVENTS
OF
THE
PAST
BUT
WE
CAN
AND
WE
MUST
STRIVE
TO
KEEP
THE
MEMORY
OF
THIS
TRAGEDY
ALIVE
ON
THIS
SIDE
OF
THE
ATLANTIC
SO
AS
TO
HELP
PREVENT
A
RECURRENCE
OF
THE
EXTERMINATION
OF
A
PEOPLE
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
RELIGION
OR
THEIR
RACE
WHICH
MEANS
THAT
I
SUPPORT
THE
CLAIMS
OF
THE
TURKS
AND
KURDS
TO
RETURN
TO
THEIR
LANDS
IN
XSOVIET
ARMENIA
TO
DETERMINE
THEIR

CLOSED
THE
ROADS
AND
MOUNTAIN

MIGHT
SERVE
AS
WAYS
OF

WORK
OF
