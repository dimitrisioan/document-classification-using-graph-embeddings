POINT
OF
VIEW
HE
SAID
ADDING
THAT
SERBIA
IS
SINCERELY
TRYING
TO
BRING
PEACE
TO
THE
REGION
THAT
IS
A
GREAT
ATTITUDE
FOR
SOMEONE
WHO
WANTS
TO
PRESSURE
THE
SERBS
TO
ACCEPT
A
PEACE
PLAN
THAT
GIVES
THEM
MOST
OF
THE
TERRITORY
THEY

GREECE
HAD
PRACTICALLY
IDENTICAL
VIEWS
ON

THE

THREATENED
TO
IMPOSE
NEW
SANCTIONS
AGAINST
SERBIA
AND
MONTENEGRO
AND
IMPLEMENT
A
NOFLY
ZONE
OVER
BOSNIAN
SKIES
STILL
IN
THE
THREATENING
STAGE
MAYBE
WHEN
THERE

NO
MORE
BOSNIANS
