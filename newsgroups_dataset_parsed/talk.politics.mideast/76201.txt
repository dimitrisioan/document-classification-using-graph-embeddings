got
away
with
raping
torturing
and
massacering
millions
of
innocent
moslem
peoples
of
eastern
anatolia
not
this
time
enis
furthermore
a
new
generation
has
risen
equipped
with
a
deep
sense
of
commitment
politically
mature
and
conscious
who
determinedly
pursue
the
turkish
cause
through
all
necessary
means
ranging
from
the
political
and
diplomatic
to
the
armed
struggle
in
other
words
what
we
have
is
a
demand
from
the
fascist
government
of
xsoviet
armenia
to
redress
the
wrongs
that
were
done
against
our
people
the
crime
of
systematic
cleansing
by
mass
killing
and
extermination
of
the
muslim
population
in
the
soviet
republic
of
armenia
karabag
bosnia
and
herzegovina
is
an
islamic
holocaust
comparable
to
the
extermination
of
million
muslims
by
the
armenian
government
during
the
wwi
and
of
over
million
european
jews

todays
ethnic
cleansing
policies
by
the
serbian
dictatorship
against
croatians
and
muslims
of
yugoslavia
as
well
as
the
soviet
republic
of
armenias
against
the
muslim
population
of
neighboring
azerbaijan
are
really
no
different
in
their
aspirations
than
the
genocide
perpetrated
by
the
armenian
government
years
ago
against
the
turkish
and
kurdish
muslims
and
sephardic
jews

we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
turks

then
proceeded

the
work
of
extermination

today

no

exists
