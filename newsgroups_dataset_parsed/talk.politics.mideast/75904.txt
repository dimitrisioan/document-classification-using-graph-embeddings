one
of
the
most
revolting
triumphs
in
the
senseless
mindless
history
of
armenian
terrorism
such
a
murder
brings
absolutely
nothing
except
an
ego
boost
for
the
murderer
within
the
armenian
terrorist
underworld
which

mr
turkish
governmental

prove

even
existed
in

go

provide

the
newspaper

the
turkish
government
is
good
at
excising
text
from
their
references
lets
see
how
good
thay
are
at
adding
text
to
verifiable
newspaper
accounts
the
turkish
government
cant
support
any
of
their
antiarmenian
claims
as
typified
in
the
above
scribed
garbage
that
government
continues
to
make
false
and
libelous
charges
for
they
have
no
recourse
left
after
having
made
fools
out
of
through
their
attempt
at
a
systematic
campaign
at
denying
and
covering
up
the
turkish
genocide
of
the
armenians
just
like
a
dog
barking
at
a
moving
bus
it
barks
jumps
yells
until
the
bus
stops
at
which
point
it
just
walks
away
such
will
be
with
this
posting
turkish
agents
level
the
most
ridiculous
charges
and
when
brought
to
answer
they
are
silent
like
the
dog
after
the
bus
stops
the
turkish
government
feels
it
can
funnel
a
heightened
state
of
ultra
nationalism
existing
in
turkey
today
onto
usenet
and
convince
people
via
its
revisionist
myopic
and
incidental
view
of
themselves
and
their
place
in
the
world
the
resulting
inability
to
address
armenian
and
greek
refutations
of
turkeys
rewrite
of
history
is
to
refer
to
me
as
a
terrorist
and
worse
claim
as
part
of
the
record
i
took
responsibility
for
the
murder
of
people
what
a
pack
of
raging
fools
blinded
by
antiarmenian
fascism
its
too
bad
the
socialization
policies
of
the
republic
of
turkey
requires
it
to
always
find
nonturks
to
dehumanize
such
will
be
their
downfall
