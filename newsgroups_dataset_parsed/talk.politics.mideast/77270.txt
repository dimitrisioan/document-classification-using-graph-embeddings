not
a

as
early
as
k

papazian
asserted
in
patriotism
perverted
that
the
armenians
lean
toward
fascism
and
at
that
time
he
could
not
have
foreseen
that
the
armenians
would
actively
assume
a
progerman
stance

even
collaborate

extreme

could
be
observed

was
quoted
in

hairenik
weekly
the
race
is
force
it
is
treasure
if
we
follow
history
we
shall
see
that
races
due
to
their
innate
force
have
created
the
nations
and
these
have
been
secure
only
insofar
as
they
have
reverted
to
the
race
after
becoming
a
nation
today
germany
and
italy
are
strong
because
as
nations
they
live
and
breath
in
terms
of
race
on
the
other
hand
russia
is
comparatively
weak
because
she
is
bereft
