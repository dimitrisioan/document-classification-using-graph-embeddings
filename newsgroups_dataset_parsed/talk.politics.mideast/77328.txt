MUSLIM
IN
EXYUGOSLAVIA
WAS
A
NATION
NOT
A
RELIGION
IN
FACT
NOT
ALL
MUSLIMS
IN
BH
ARE
FOLLOWERS
OF
ISLAM
THEREFORE
THERE
DO
DID
EXIST
IN
EXYUGOSLAVIA
CHRISTIAN
MUSLIMS
YEAH
THATS
IT
YOUVE
REALLY
OUTDONE
YOURSELF
THIS
TIME
NICK
DONT
FORGET
THE
DAVIDIAN
MUSLIMS
ISLAM
IS
NOT
A
RACE
ITS
A
RELIGION
YOU
CAN
BE
WHITE
BLACK
FIJIAN
OR
ALASKAN
THIS
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
THE
FACT
THAT
MUSLIM
IS
A
LEGAL
AND
POLITICAL
TERM
DEFINED
CONSTITUTIONALLY
IN
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
AND
THEREFORE
HAS
MEANING
AND
CONSEQUENCES
ENTIRELY
INDEPENDENT
AND
IMMATERIAL
OF
ANY
RELIGIOUS
CONSIDERATIONS
IT
IS
A
CIVIL
WAR
IN
WHICH
THE
TERMS
OF
SECESSION
ARE
BEING
NEGOTIATED
WITH
GUNS
INSTEAD
OF
PENS
THE
CROAT
MUSLIM
AND
SERB
POLITICAL
LEADERS
ALL
CHOSE
TO
FIGHT
OVER
THE
TERMS
OF
SECESSION
INSTEAD
OF
COMPROMISING
AND
PEACEFULLY
NEGOTIATING
MULTILATERAL
SECESSION
AGREEMENTS
TERMS
OF
SECESSION
YOU
ARE
OF
COURSE
JOKING
RIGHT
NICK
NOBODY
CHOSE
TO
FIGHT
BOSNIA
AND
CROATIA
WERE
INTERNATIONALLY
RECOGNIZED
NATIONS
WHEN
THE
SERBS
ATTACKED
AND
STARTED
ON
THEIR
WELLDOCUMENTED
GENOCIDE
THAT
MAKES
THEM
AN
OUTSIDE
AGGRESSOR
ITS
A
SIMPLE
GENOCIDE
A
CLASSICAL
EXAMPLE
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
OF
CIVIL
WAR
YOU
ONLY
WISH
IT
WERE
SO
MORE
THAN
RESIDENTS
OF
CROATIA
AND
BH
HAVE
NOT
ACCEPTED
THE
TERMS
OF
SECESSION
WHICH
TUDJMAN
AND
IZETBEGOVIC
UNILATERALLY
FORCED
UPON
THEM
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
MAY
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
NEGOTIATED
SECESSION
BUT
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
GRAB
THE
ENTIRE
TERRITORIES
OF
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAV
REPUBLICS
OF
CROATIA
AND
BH
OH
BTW
YUGOSLAVIA
WAS
INTERNATIONALLY
RECOGNIZED
WHEN
IT
WAS
DESTROYED
BY
TUDJMAN
IZETBEGOVIC
MILOSEVIC
AND
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY
LED
BY
GERMANY
IF
YUGOSLAVIAS
BORDERS
COULD
BE
CHANGED
AGAINST
ITS
WILL
THEN
CERTAINLY
CROATIAS
BORDERS
AND
BHS
BORDERS
CAN
BE
CHANGED
AS
WELL
AS
I
HAVE
STATED
MANY
TIMES
THE
CIVIL
WAR
IN
EXYUGOSLAVIA
WILL
END
WHEN
THE
TERMS
OF
SECESSION
BORDERS
ETC
FOR
CROATIA
AND
BH
ARE
FINALLY
AGREED
UPON
SERBS
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
WILL
ALL
HAVE
TO
MAKE
TERRITORIAL
CONCESSIONS
TO
REACH
SUCH
AN
AGREEMENT
