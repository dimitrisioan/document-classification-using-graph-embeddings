re
final
solution
in
palestine
ok
its
my
turn
driving
the
jews
into
the
sea
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
this
driving
the
jews
into
the
sea
sentance
attributed
to
islamic
movements
and
the
plo
it
simply
cant
be
proven
as
part
of
their
plan
may
i
suggest
you
chech
out
the
palestinian
national
covenant
it
may
not
use
the
exact
words
as
quoted
above
but
im
sure
many
will
agree
that
the
same
message
is
being
issued
later
on
when
i
get
back
home
i
will
try
to
find
the
precise
sections
but
you
can
do
the
research
for
now
i
hope
i
also
realize
that
yasser
arafat
renounced
the
covenant
to
the
western
media
only
but
he
has
yet
to
inform
the
pnc
officially
and
enequivocally
of
his
exact
intentions
on
this
issue
therefore
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
the
covenant
still
stands
as
the
bible
so
to
speak
of
the
mainstream
palestinian
national
movement
pro
israeli
activists
repeat
it
like
parrots
without
checking
its
authenticity
since
it
was
coined
by
bnai
brith
as
a
staunch
proisrael
activist
i
can
confidently
say
that
bnai
brith
has
not
influenced
my
opinions
on
the
arabisraeli
conflict
as
i
mentioned
above
just
a
little
research
on
the
subject
will
lead
anyone
to
reach
a
similar
conclusion
on
the
palestinian
national
movement
the
plo
in
most
cases
bb
does
not
properly
speak
for
me
nor
many
of
the
people
around
me
who
share
my
views
what
hamas
and
islamic
jihad
believe
in
as
far
as
i
can
get
from
the
arab
media
is
an
islamic
state
that
protects
the
rights
of
all
its
inhabitants
under
koranic
law
this
would
be
a
reversal
of
the
situation
in
which
the
jews
in
palestine
took
control
of
the
land
and
its
mostly
muslim
inhabitants
what
situation
a
negative
situation
i
presume
is
this
the
same
situation
when
the
jordanian
occupiers
of
east
jerusalem
would
not
allow
the
jews
to
go
worship
at
the
holiest
site
in
judiasm
was
this
an
example
of
quranic
law
being
exercised
if
not
i
have
another
suggested
reading
for
you
get
into
the
socculturearabic
newsgroup
where
the
posters
have
been
debating
the
topic
jews
in
the
quran
and
may
i
remind
you
the
people
doing
the
debating
appear
to
be
devout
muslims
with
some
knowledge
of
the
quran
you
will
find
that
jews
arent
really
viewed
positively
by
the
quran
to
put
it
lightly
so
how
do
you
think
jews
or
any
other
nonislamic
religion
will
be
treated
by
an
islamic
state
governed
by
the
words
of
the
quran
i
think
the
situation
in
jerusalem
will
return
at
best
what
do
you
think
however
whoever
committed
crimes
against
humanity
torture
blowing
up
their
homes
murders
must
be
treated
and
tried
as
a
war
criminal
the
political
thought
of
these
movements
shows
that
a
freedom
of
choice
will
be
given
to
the
jews
in
living
under
the
new
law
or
leaving
to
the
destintion
of
their
choice
all
i
have
to
say
to
that
is
once
again
see
sca
jews
in
the
quran
and
think
again
freedom
of
choice
is
definitely
not
an
option
in
quranic
law
especially
for
nonmuslims
and
all
women
remember
the
gulf
war
im
sure
you
saw
the
reports
about
how
women
had
few
rights
in
saudi
arabia
an
islamic
state
as
for
the
plo
i
am
at
a
loss
to
explain
what
is
going
inside
arafats
mind
probably
nothing
aside
from
how
to
break
the
news
to
his
palestinian
brethren
that
the
covenant
is
null
and
void
without
getting
assassinated
himself
although
their
political
thinking
seems
far
fetched
with
israel
acting
as
a
true
superpower
in
the
region
the
islamic
movements
are
using
the
same
weapon
the
jews
used
to
establish
their
state
religion
in
conclusion
ahmed
you
should
go
to
the
library
and
find
the
palestinian
national
covenant
and
read
it
very
carefully
by
the
way
redpath
library
does
have
it
in
stock
because
that
is
exactly
where
i
found
it
when
i
was
doing
my
research
so
enjoy
the
reading
and
i
hope
we
will
be
hearing
back
from
you
soon
