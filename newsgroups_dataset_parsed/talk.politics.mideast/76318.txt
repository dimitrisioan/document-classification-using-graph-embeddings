legality
of
the
jewish
purchase

in
article
zbibbnrca
writes
it
was
shafting
on
the
part
of
the
arab
land
owners
for
doing
it
without
notifying
their
tenant
farmers
and
for
not
being
responsible
enough
to
make
provisions
for
them
but
rather
just
leaving
them
to
their
fate
if
a
landlord
sells
an
apartment
building
vacant
to
another
landlord
and
fails
to
notify
his
tenants
they
just
might
find
themselves
out
on
the
street
all
of
a
sudden
the
seller
may
be
a
scoundrel
and
a
crook
but
this
doesnt
make
the
buyer
a
thief
as
israelis
are
so
often
called
here
on
tpm
it
is
interesting
though
that
you
acknowledge
that
the
palestinians
were
shafted
do
many
israelis
or
jews
share
your
opinion
do
you
absolve
the
purchaser
from
any
ethical
commitments
just
because
it
wasnt
written
down
i
dont
know
if
others
share
this
opinion
it
is
mine
and
im
sure
there
are
some
who
agree
and
some
who
dont
the
way
i
see
it
the
fallahin
were
caught
in
circumstances
beyond
their
control
in
that
since
they
didnt
own
the
land
they
didnt
have
a
say
of
course
now
for
the
sake
of
the
greater
arab
unity
the
arabs
are
angry
that
the
land
was
sold
to
the
jews
an
act
that
is
illegal
in
jordan
but
when
it
happened
it
was
just
business
the
arabs
that
lived
along
the
coast
in
western
palestine
later
to
be
called
israel
were
shafted
by
their
brother
arabs
just
as
theyve
been
shafted
for
decades
since
then
by
their
arab
bretheren
somehow
though
the
arab
call
has
continued
to
blame
israel
not
only
for
the
syrian
landowner
sellout
in
western
palestine
israel
but
even
for
the
occupation
of
eastern
palestine
jordan
by
the
hashemites
this
is
just
more
of
refusing
to
take
blame
for
ones
own
actions
infrastructure
etc
imho
the
palestinians
have
grounds
to
contest
the
legality
of
the
purchase
say
in
world
court
if
your
job
was
eliminated
in
a
corporate
takeover
you
could
probably
go
to
court
too
youd
probably
lose
