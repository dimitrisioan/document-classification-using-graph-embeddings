peace
proposal
a
unconventional
proposal
for
peace
in
the
middleeast
by
elias
davidsson
having
stated
my
assumptions
i
will
now
state
my
proposal
a
fund
should
be
established
which
would
disburse
grants
for
each
child
born
to
a
couple
where
one
partner
is
israelijew
and
the
other
palestinianarab
the
emergence
of
a
considerable
number
of
mixed
marriages
in
israelpalestine
all
of
whom
would
have
relatives
on
both
sides
of
the
divide
would
make
the
conflict
lose
its
ethnical
and
unsoluble
core
and
strengthen
the
emergence
of
a
truly
civil
society
the
existence
of
a
strong
mixed
stock
of
people
would
also
help
the
integration
of
israeli
society
into
the
sounds
just
like
a
racial
theory
that
hitler
outlined
