WRITES
DONT
FORGET
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
FRENCH
RESISTANCE
TO
THE
NAZI
OCCUPYING
FORCES
WHICH
EVENTUALLY
SUCCEEDED
IN
DRIVING
OUT
THE
HOSTILE
OCCUPIERS
IN
WWII
ACTUALLY
THIS
IS
INCORRECT
FRENCH
RESISTANCE
MAY
HAVE
PLAYED
SOME
PART
IN
HINDERING
THE
GERMAN

EFFORT
HOWEVER
THE
CRUCIAL
ROLE
WAS
SUPPLIED
ON
DDAY
DIPLOMACY
HAS
NOT
WORKED
WITH
ISRAEL
AND
THE
LEBANESE
PEOPLE
ARE
TIRED
OF
BEING
OCCUPIED
THEY
ARE
NOW
TURNING
TO
THE
ONLY
OPTION
THEY
SEE
AS
VIABLE
DONT
FORGET

AS
ISRAEL
OF

ONE
OF
THE

OBSTACLES
TO
ISRAELS
COMPLETE
WITHDRAWAL
IS
THE
LACK
OF
GOVERNMENTAL
CONTROL
THAT
CAN
BE
APPLIED
TO
THE
AREA
AS
WELL
AS
THE
LARGE
PRESENCE
OF
SYRIAN

WHICH
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
ASKED
