if
you
are
really
interested
i
can
provide
you
with
a
number
of
references
oy
on
the
issue
just
send
me
email
for
that
you
think
i
am
that
stupid
to
ask
you
for
references
not
i
have
many
greek
friends
that
i
could
ask
for
the
info
if
i
needed
i
have
already
read
many
articles
and
do
not
need
your
help
boy
how
generous
there
is
a
very
narrow
margin
of
stupidity
between
accepting
my
references
and
those
of
the
greeks
and
you
just
said
youd
rather
do
the
latter
thats
fine
with
me
i
was
sincere
in
my
offer
but
this
saves
me
the
effort
it
doesnt
take
a
halfbrained
man
to
go
to
any
library
and
check
out
a
bunch
of
sources
of
decent
objectivity
just
ask
a
good
friend
for
help
stay
on
these
roads
