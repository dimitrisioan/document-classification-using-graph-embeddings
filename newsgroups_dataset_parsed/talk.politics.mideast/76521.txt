WRITES
IT
DEPENDS
ENTIRELY
ON
HOW
YOU
DEFINE
WAR
THE
ACTUAL
FIGHTING
LARGELY
PREDATES
THE
ARAB
INVASIONS
AFTER
ALL
DEIR
YASSIN
HAPPENED
IN
MIDAPRIL
WELL
BEFORE
THE
ARAB
INVASION
HOW
DO
YOU
DEFINE
WAR
DO
SEIGES
AND
CONSTANT
ATTACKS
ON
VILLIAGES
COUNT
AS
ACTS
OF
WAR
OR
IS
THAT
ONLY
WHEN
THE
JEWS
DO
THEM
I
WOULD
HOPE
THAT
IF
YOU
INTEND
TO
HAVE
A
REASONABLE
DISCUSSION
YOU
MIGHT
WAIT
UNTIL
I
EXPRESS
AN
OPINION
BEFORE
DECIDING
I
SHOULD
BE
FLAMED
FOR
IT
AS
FOR
WAR
I
AM
NOT
SURE
HOW
I
WOULD
DEFINE
IT
IF
YOU
JUST
LOOK
AT
ATTACKS
ON
VILLAGES
THEN
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
OF
DECIDING
WHEN
IT
STARTED
WOULD
YOU
COUNT
THE
RIOTS
IN
THE
AND
VIOLENCE
BUT
NOT
WAR
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
THAT
WAR
AS
OPPOSED
TO
CIVIL
DISTURBANCE
OR
WHATEVER
REQUIRES
ORGANISATION
PLANNING
AND
SOME
MEASURE
OF
REGUALR
OR
SEMIREGULAR
FORCES
PERHAPS
THE
ARAB
LIBERATION
ARMY
COUNTS
I
COULD
EASILY
BE
CONVINCED
IT
WAS
SO
FROM
WHAT
I
KNOW
THEY
DID
NOT
HAVE
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
PLANNING
LET
ALONE
ORGANISATION
THE
HAGANAH
AND
PALMACH
CERTAINLY
DID
THAT
IS
NOT
A
CAUSE
FOR
CRITICISM
IT
MERELY
REFLECTS
THE
GREAT
ORGANISATION
GENERALLY
IN
THE
ZIONIST
CAMP
OF
COURSE
THIS
ISNT
WAR
SINCE
ITS
ONLY
THE
ARABS
ATTACKING
NOW
YOU
ARE
BEING
SILLY
ARENT
YOU
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
WAR
DID
NOT
START
WITH
THE
INVASION
OF
THE
ARAB
ARMIES
YOU
SEE
WE
BOTH
AGREE
ON
SOMETHING
AND
THE
PREVIOUS
POSTERS
WERE
WRONG
NO
JUST
LIKE
LAST
WEEK
WHEN
THE
FATAH
LAUNCHED
KATYUSHA
ROCKETS
AGAINST
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
WHERE
DOES
UPRISING
END
AND
WAR
BEGIN
AGAIN
I
AM
NOT
SURE
I
DOUBT
YOU
WANT
MY
OPINION
ANYWAY
BUT
I
THINK
WAR
REQUIRES
ORGANISATION
AS
I
SAID
BEFORE
IT
NEEDS
A
GROUP
TO
COMMAND
AND
PLAN
IF
FATAH
LAUCHES
ROCKETS
FROM
SOUTHERN
LEBANON
AND
ARE
YOU
SURE
YOU
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
GROUP
NOT
THE
MOSLEMS
AGAIN
THEN
THAT
SOUNDS
LIKE
WAR
TO
ME
STONE
THROWING
DOES
NOT

NORTH

THE

RATHER
