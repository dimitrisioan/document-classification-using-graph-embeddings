since
one
is
also
unlikely
to
get
the
truth
from
either
arab
or
palestinian
news
outlets
where
do
we
go
to
understand
to
learn
is
one
form
of
propoganda
more
reliable
than
another
there
are
many
neutral
human
rights
organizations
which
always
report
on
the
situation
in
the
ot
a
neutral
organization
would
report
on
the
situation
in
israel
where
the
elderly
and
children
are
the
victims
of
stabbings
by
hamas
activists
a
neutral
organization
might
also
report
that
israeli
arabs
have
full
civil
rights
the
israelis
used
to
arrest
and
sometimes
to
kill
some
of
these
neutral
reporters
care
to
name
names
or
is
this
yet
another
unsubstantiated
slander
so
this
is
another
kind
of
terrorism
committed
by
the
jews
in
palestine
they
do
not
allow
fair
and
neutral
coverage
of
the
situation
in
palestine
terrorism
as
you
would
know
if
you
had
a
spine
that
allowed
you
to
stand
up
is
random
attacks
on
civilians
terorism
includes
such
things
as
shooting
a
cripple
and
thowing
him
off
the
side
of
a
boat
because
he
happens
to
be
jewish
not
allowing
people
to
go
where
they
are
likely
to
be
stabbed
and
killed
like
a
certain
lawyer
killed
last
week
is
not
terorism

we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
