A
CROWD
OF
PEOPLE
WALKING

ARMATURE
SHAFTS
AND

WAY
THE

US
HOW
THEY
KNOW
WHOS
AN
ARMENIAN
AND
WHOS
NOT
THE
ARMENIANS
USUALLY
FOR
EXAMPLE
IM
AN
ARMENIAN
BUT
I
SPEAK
THEIR
LANGUAGE
VERY
WELL
WELL
ARMENIANS
USUALLY
PRONOUNCE
THE
AZERI
WORD
FOR
NUT
OR
LITTLE
NUT
AS
PUNDUKH
BUT
FUNDUKH
IS
ACTUALLY
CORRECT
THE
PRONUNCIATIONS
ARE
DIFFERENT
ANYONE
WHO
SAYS
PUNDUKH
EVEN
IF
THEYRE
NOT
ARMENIAN
THEY
IMMEDIATELY
TAKE
OUT
AND
START
TO
SLASH
ANOTHER
ONE
SAYS
THERE
WAS
A
CAR
THERE
WITH
FIVE
PEOPLE
INSIDE
IT
HE
SAYS
THEY
STARTED
HITTING
THE
SIDE
OF
IT
WITH
AN
AXE
AND
LIT
IT
ON
FIRE
AND
THEY
DIDNT
LET
THE
PEOPLE
OUT
HE
SAYS
THEY
WOULDNT
LET
THEM
GET
OUT
OF
THE
CAR
I
ONLY
SAW
THE
CAR
BUT
THE
DRIVER
SAYS
THAT
HE
SAW
EVERYTHING
WELL
HE
OFTEN
DRIVES
FROM
BAKU
TO
SUMGAIT
AND
BACK
WHEN
THEY
STOP
US
WE
ALL
GET
OUT
OF
THE
CAR
I
LOOK
AND
THERES
A
SHORT
GUY
HIS
EYES
ARE
GLEAMING
HE
HAS
AN
ARMATURE
SHAFT
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
A
STONE
IN
THE
OTHER
AND
ASKS
THE
GUYS
WHAT
NATIONALITY
THEY
ARE
ONE
BY
ONE
WERE
AZERBAIJANI
THEY
TELL
HIM
NO
ARMENIANS
HERE
HE
DID
COME
UP
TO
ME
WHEN
WE
WERE
PULLING
OUR
THINGS
OUT
AND
SAYS
MAYBE
YOURE
AN
ARMENIAN
OLD
MAN
BUT
IN
AZERBAIJANI
I
SAY
YOU
SHOULD
BE
ASHAMED
OF
YOURSELF
AND
HE
LEFT
TURNED
AND
LEFT
THAT
WAS
ALL
THAT
HAPPENED
WHAT
WAS
I
TO
DO
I
HAD
TO
THE
CITY
WAS
ON
FIRE
BUT
I
HAD
TO
STEAL
MY
CHILDREN
OUT
OF
MY
OWN
HOME
THEY
STOPPED
US
AT
THE
ENTRANCE
TO
MIR
STREET
THATS
WHERE
THE
KAVKAZ
STORE
AND
THREE
LARGE
BUILDINGS
ARE
THATS
THE
BEGINNING
OF
DOWNTOWN
I
SAW
THAT
BURNED
AUTOMOBILE
THERE
COMPLETELY
BURNED
ONLY
METAL
REMAINED
I
COULDNT
FIGURE
OUT
IF
IT
WAS
A
ZHIGULI
OR
A
ZAPOROZHETS
LATER
I
WAS
TOLD
IT
WAS
A
ZHIGULI
AND
THE
PEOPLE
IN
THERE
WERE
COMPLETELY
INCINERATED
NOTHING
REMAINED
OF
THEM
NOT
EVEN
ANY
TRACES
THAT
DRIVER
HAD
TOLD
ME
ABOUT
IT
AND
I
SAW
THE
CAR
MYSELF
THE
CAR
WAS
THERE
THE
SKELETON
A
METALLIC
CARCASS
ABOUT
TO
YARDS
FROM
THE
KAVKAZ
STORE
I
SEE
A
MILITARY
TRANSPORT
AN
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
THE
HATCHES
ARE
CLOSED
AND
PEOPLE
ARE
THROWING
ARMATURE
SHAFTS
AND
PIECES
OF
IRON
AT
IT
THE
CROWD
IS
AND
I
HEAR
SHOTS
NOT
AUTOMATIC
FIRE
ITS
TRUE
BUT
PISTOL
SHOTS
SEVERAL
SHOTS
THERE
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
CROWDED
AROUND
THAT
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
SOMEONE
IN
THE
CROWD
WAS
SHOOTING
APPARENTLY
THEY
EITHER
WANTED
TO
KILL
THE
SOLDIERS
OR
GET
A
MACHINE
GUN
OR
SOMETHING
AT
THAT
POINT
THERE
WAS
ONLY
ONE
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
AND
ALL
THE
TANKS
WERE
OUTSIDE
THE
CITY
CORDONING
OFF
SUMGAIT
I
WALKED
ON
I
SEE
TWO
AZERBAIJANIS
GOING
HOME
FROM
THE
PLANT
I
CAN
TELL
BY
THEIR
GAIT
THAT
THEYRE
NOT
BANDITS
THEYRE
JUST
PEOPLE
WALKING
HOME
I
JOINED
THEM
SO
IN
CASE
SOMETHING
HAPPENED
IN
CASE
SOMEONE
CAME
UP
TO
US
AND
ASKED
QUESTIONS
EITHER
OF
US
WOULD
BE
IN
A
POSITION
TO
ANSWER
YOU
SEE
BUT
I
AVOIDED
THE
LARGE
GROUPS
BECAUSE
IM
A
LOCAL
AND
MIGHT
BE
QUICKLY
RECOGNIZED
I
TRIED
TO
KEEP
AT
A
DISTANCE
AND
WALKED
WHERE
THERE
WERE
FEWER
PEOPLE
WELL
SO
I
WALKED
INTO
MICRODISTRICT
WHICH
IS
ACROSS
FROM
OUR
BLOCK
I
CANT
GET
INTO
OUR
BLOCK
BUT
I
WALKED
WHERE
THERE
WERE
FEWER
PEOPLE
SO
AS
TO
GET
AROUND
WELL
THERE
I
SEE
A
TALL
GUY
AND
TO
PEOPLE
ARE
WALKING
BEHIND
HIM
AND
HES
SHOUTING
INTO
A
MEGAPHONE
COMRADES
THE
ARMENIAN
AZERBAIJANI
WAR
HAS
BEGUN
THE
POLICE
HAVE
MEGAPHONES
LIKE
THAT
SO
THEYRE
TALKING
AND
WALKING
AROUND
THE
SECOND
MICRODISTRICT
I
SEE
THAT
THEYRE
COMING
MY
WAY
AND
TURN
OFF
BEHIND
A
BUILDING
I
NOTICED
THAT
THEY
WALKED
AROUND
THE
OUTSIDE
BUILDINGS
AND
INSIDE
THE
MICRODISTRICTS
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
OR
PEOPLE
STANDING
ON
EVERY
CORNER
AND
AT
THE
MIDDLES
OF
THE
BUILDINGS
AND
AT
THE
EDGES
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
I
CANT
SAY
BECAUSE
I
COULDNT
GET
UP
CLOSE
TO
THEM
I
WAS
AFRAID
BUT
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
THING
WAS
TO
GET
AWAY
FROM
THERE
TO
GET
HOME
AND
AT
LEAST
FIND
OUT
IF
MY
CHILDREN
WERE
ALIVE
