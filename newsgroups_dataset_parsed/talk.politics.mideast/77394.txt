traditional
and
historical
armenian
fascism
and
barbarism
in
article

writes
it
was
five
years
ago
that
karabakh
voted
overwhelmingly
to
seperate
from
azerbaijan
why
is
the
un
not
enforcing
their
will
is
that
how
the
mind
of
a
compulsive
liar
works
the
scenario
and
genocide
staged
by
the
armenians
years
ago
in
xsoviet
armenia
is
being
reenacted
again
this
time
in
azerbaijan
there
are
remarkable
similarities
between
the
plots
the
perpetrators
and
the
underdogs
the
stories
of
survivors
of
karabag
massacre
year
old
hatin
nine
telling
my
twin
grandchildren
were
cut
to
pieces
in
front
of
my
eyes
they
told
me
we
wont
kill
you
but
the
babies
have
to
die
in
front
of
your
eyes
year
old
huseyin
ibrahimoglu
our
turkish
village
in
khojalu
town
was
blown
up
in
two
hours
while
killing
children
and
babies
mercilessly
they
said
you
are
turks
you
must
die
year
old
gulsum
huseyin
they
bayonetted
my
year
old
daughter
in
her
stomach
in
front
of
my
eyes
are
these
stories
lies
have
the
eyewitnesses
been
daydreaming
were
these
stories
forged
by
turkish
journalists
in
the
region
the
nonsense
of
such
a
claim
is
clear
from
the
writings
of
british
journalists
too
two
days
before
we
had
quoted
from
a
sunday
times
article
theybritish
reported
the
events
in
karabag
even
before
turkish
journalists
what
is
more
here
are
the
pictures
pictures
of
people
who
were
bayonetted
whose
eyes
were
gouged
ears
cut
off
even
the
armenian
radio
couldnt
claim
these
lies
they
are
saying
exaggeration
that
means
somethings
have
happened
but
the
situation
is
not
as
bad
as
reported
perhaps
that
village
of
khojalu
town
was
destroyed
in
hours
instead
of
or
gulsum
huseyins
year
old
daughter
was
bayonetted
in
her
chest
instead
of
stomach
the
massacre
is
clearly
seen
with
all
its
dimensions
the
effects
of
this
massacre
on
karabag
and
environs
cannot
be
reduced
by
any
word
some
of
the
western
press
led
by
some
french
newspapers
ability
to
close
their
eyes
is
nothing
but
complicity
in
this
massacre
yesterday
we
gave
samples
from
le
figaro
until
yesterdays
print
no
news
about
the
real
events
in
karabag
were
printed
so
were
the
french
tv
channels
the
subject
they
considered
related
to
karabag
was
the
necessity
of
protecting
armenians
against
azeri
attacks
the
age
we
are
living
in
is
termed
a
human
rights
age
there
are
lots
of
organizations
such
as
united
nations
and
csceconference
on
security
and
cooperation
in
europe
and
rules
all
designed
to
fight
against
human
rights
violations
international
reactions
must
be
made
with
international
cooperation
with
support
of
everybody
and
every
organization
claiming
to
be
civilized
could
there
be
a
more
serious
human
rights
violation
than
that
of
the
right
to
live
and
with
such
levels
of
barbarity
and
cruelty
where
is
the
cooperation
where
are
the
reactions
and
the
intellectuals
journalists
writers
tv
stations
of
certain
western
countries
such
as
france
who
are
fast
to
claim
leadership
of
human
rights
where
are
you
serdar
argic
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
turks
and
then
proceeded
in
the
work
of
extermination
ohanus
appressian
in
soviet
armenia
today
there
no
longer
exists
a
single
turkish
soul
