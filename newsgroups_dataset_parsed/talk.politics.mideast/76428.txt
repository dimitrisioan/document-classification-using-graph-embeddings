says
for
all
those
interested
i
would
like
to
inform
all
that
binyamin
netanyahu
leader
of
the
israeli
likud
party
will
be
interviewed
on
cnn
tonight
on
larry
king
live
didnt
this
guy
go
crying
on
the
zionist
tv
confessing
that
he
committed
adultary
and
was
cheating
on
his
wife
a
typical
jew
leader
huh
yes
he
is
actually
the
typical
muslimarab
leader
hides
the
fact
that
he
commited
adultery
by
choosing
a
camel
over
his
husband
or
a
small
male
child
whichever
is
more
readily
availible
h
a
m
z
a
ed
but
the
irony
is
that
the
jewish
population
has
no
problem
in
electing
a
leader
who
has
confessed
to
having
an
extra
marrital
affair
this
is
a
first
aa
what
else
do
you
expect
israel
is
trying
to
portray
itself
as
the
great
democracy
one
requirement
is
to
have
a
leader
who
previously
had
an
extramarital
affair
eg
bill
clinton
it
helps
if
your
wife
says
its
ok
