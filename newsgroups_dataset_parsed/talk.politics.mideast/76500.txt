WRITES
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
ISRAELIS
AND
ARABS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ACHIEVE
PEACE
AFTER
ALMOST
YEARS
OF
FIGHTING
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
TWO
MAJOR
REASONS
ARAB
GOVERNMENTS
ARE
NOT
REALLY
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
THEIR
PEOPLE
CURRENTLY
MOST
OF
THEIR
LEADERS
ARE
STUPID
ANDOR
NOT
INDEPENDENT
ANDOR
DICTATORS
TRUE
BUT
MAYBE
NOT
THE
WORST
POSSIBLE
SEE
ALGERIA
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
IS
ARROGANT
AND
NONE
COMPRISING
THIS
WAS
TRUE
AND
I
MAY
ADD
THE
ADJECTIVE
STUPID
UNTIL
THE
INTIFADA
SINCE
THEN
NO
SERIOUS
ISRAELI
LEADER
INCLUDING
SHAMIR
REALLY
THINKS
THE
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
WORTH
THE
TROUBLE
THE
ONLY
QUESTION
BECAME
THE
QUESTION
OF
PRICE
AND
OTHER
QUANTITATIVE
DETAIL
THE
BEST
THING
THE
PALESTINIANS
CAN
DO
FOR
THEMSELVES
THESE
DAYS
IS
TO
STOP
THE
INTIFADA
AND
TRY
TO
LIVE
AS
NORMALLY
AS
POSSIBLE
I
KNOW
ITS
HARD
UNDER
OCCUPATION
OTHERWISE
PEOPLE
MIGHT
THINK
THAT
FIVE
YEARS
OF
STONE
THROWING
AS
JUSTIFIED
AS
IT
MAY
BE
HAS
CAUSED
THE
PALESTINIANS
AN
IRREVERSIBLE
DAMAGE
THAT
PREVENTS
THEM
FROM
RUNNING
A
NORMAL
STATE
WHEN
THE
TIME
COMES
CURRENTLY
IT
SERVES
NO
PURPOSE
AND
ITS
JUST
A
WASTE
OF
HUMAN
LIFE
AND
ECONOMIC
RESOURCES
