what
are
you
talking
about
the
rabin
government
has
clearly
indicated
its
interest
in
a
territorial
compromise
that
would
leave
the
vast
majority
of
the
arabs
in
judea
samaria
and
gaza
outside
israeli
control
just
an
interrupting
comment
here
since
early
israelis
said
they
are
willing
to
give
up
the
adminstration
rule
of
the
occupied
terretories
to
palestineans
palestineans
refused
and
will
refuse
such
settlement
that
denies
them
their
right
of
selfdetermination
period
i
know
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
not
compromising
may
be
a
bad
idea
and
there
are
in
israel
voices
against
negotiations
and
i
think
there
are
many
among
palestineans
also
against
any
negociations
just
an
opinion
dorin
ok
i
donot
know
why
there
are
israeli
voices
against
negotiations
however
i
would
guess
that
is
because
they
refuse
giving
back
a
land
for
those
who
have
the
right
for
it
as
for
the
arabian
and
palestinean
voices
that
are
against
the
current
negotiations
and
the
socalled
peace
process
they
are
not
against
peace
per
se
but
rather
for
their
wellfounded
predictions
that
israel
would
not
give
an
inch
of
the
west
bank
and
most
probably
the
same
for
golan
heights
back
to
the
arabs
an
months
of
negotiations
in
madrid
and
washington
proved
these
predictions
now
many
will
jump
on
me
saying
why
are
you
blaming
israelis
for
noresult
negotiations
i
would
say
why
would
the
arabs
stall
the
negotiations
what
do
they
have
to
loose
arabs
feel
that
the
current
negotiations
is
only
for
legitimizing
the
current
statusquo
and
for
opening
the
doors
of
the
arab
markets
for
israeli
trade
and
oranges
that
is
simply
unacceptable
and
would
be
revoked
just
an
opinion
