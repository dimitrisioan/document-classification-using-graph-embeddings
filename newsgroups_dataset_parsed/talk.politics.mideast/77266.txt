NOW
THAT
ALL

ARE
BACK
TO

THE
STAKES

ARE
INDEED
HIGH
AND
THE
FUTURE
STABILITY
OF
THE
REGION
AND
PERHAPS
THE
WORLD
IS
IN
THE
BALANCE
WHILE
ISRAEL
CONTINUES
TO
REFUSE
TO
TALK
TO
THE
PLO
LABELLING
IT
A
TERRORIST
ORGANISATION
THE
WINDOW
OF
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
PEACE
IS
NARROWING
BY
THE
DAY
IF
THE
PRESENT
TALKS
ARE
ALLOWED
TO
DEADLOCK
WITHOUT
AGREEMENT
FOR
A
LONG
TERM
AND
LASTING
PEACE
THAT
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
THE
INTEREST
OF
ALL
INVOLVED
THE
CHANCES
OF
PEACE
WILL
INDEED
RECEED
THE
PLO
BY
ITS
DECISION
TO
REJOIN
THE
TALKS
HAS
STAKED
ITS
REPUTATION
ON
THE
SUCCESS
OF
THE
TALKS
THE
LONGER
THE
TALKS
CONTINUE
AND
THEY
STARTED
AND
HALF
YEARS
AGO
WITHOUT
ANY
TANGIBLE
PROGRESS
THE
FURTHER
WILL
THE
PLO
SUPPORT
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
ERODE
IF
A
LAND
FOR
PEACE
AGREEMENT
CAN
BE
REACHED
AND
REAL
SOON
THE
CHANCES
OF
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PEACE
TREATY
IS
GOOD
THE
ARABS
ONCE
AND
FOR
ALL
RECOGNISE
ISRAELS
RIGHT
TO
EXIST
INSIDE
SECURE
BORDERS
AND
ISREAL
WOULD
IN

RECOGNISE
THE
LEGITIMATE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PALESTINIANS
TO
SELF
DETERNIMATION
AND
STATEHOOD
WITH
PEACE
GUARANTEE
BY

TIGHT
TREATIES
THE

CAN
THEN
HOPE
TO
DWELL
ON
THE
ECONOMIC

AS
WE
SEE
RIGHT
NOW
THE
POSITION
OF

ENJOYED
BY

FAVORING
THE
NEGOTIATION
PROCESS
IS
TENUOUS
AT
BEST
THE
LOCAL
ELECTIONS
IN
HEBRON
THAT
THE
PLO
WAS
EXPECTED
TO
WIN
PERHAPS
ADDING
A
BIT
TO
ITS
FLAGGING
POSITION
OF
LEGITIMACY
IN
THE

ISRAEL
LACK
OF
SERIOUSNESS
IN
THE

AND
REFUSAL
TO
REVERSE
ALL
THE
DEPORTATIONS
IMMEDIATELY
HOPEFULLY
HOWEVER
EACH
OF
THE
PARTIES
WILL
BEGIN
TO
LEARN
THAT
JUST
THE
FACT
THAT

ARE
TAKING

DOES
NOT
MEAN
THEY
ARE
GIVING
ANYTHING
AWAY
TO
THE

LETS
