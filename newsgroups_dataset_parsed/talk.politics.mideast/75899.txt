AM
NOT
IN

READING

HOWEVER
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
WOULD

NECESSARY
ISRAELIS
TOP
LEADERS
IN
THE
PAST
AND
PRESENT
ALWAYS
COME
ACROSS
AS
ARROGANT
WITH
THEIR
TOUGH
TALKS
TRYING
TO
INTIMIDATE
THE
ARABS
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
ISRAELIS
AND
ARABS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ACHIEVE
PEACE
AFTER
ALMOST
YEARS
OF
FIGHTING
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
TWO
MAJOR
REASONS
ARAB
GOVERNMENTS
ARE
NOT
REALLY
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
THEIR
PEOPLE
CURRENTLY
MOST
OF
THEIR
LEADERS
ARE
STUPID
ANDOR
NOT
INDEPENDENT

ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
IS
ARROGANT
AND
NONE
COMPRISING
ITS
NOT

WHETHER

AGREE

AN
I
APPRECIATE
YOUR

HOWEVER
I
WOULD

THIS
IS
NOT

AT

LEVEL
ITS
NOT
ONLY
ARAB
GOVERNMENTS
NOW
ABOUT
TAUGH
TALK
AND
ARROGANCE
WE
ARE
ADULTS
ARENT
WE
DO
YOU
LISTEN
TO
TOUGH
TALK
OF

OR
SWITCH
THE
CHANNEL
I
WOULD
RATHER
BE
INTIMIDATED
BY
SOME
DUMMY
