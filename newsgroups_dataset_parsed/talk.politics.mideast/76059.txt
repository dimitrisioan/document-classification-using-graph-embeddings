THE

HELICOPTERS
WERE
THERE
TO

FIRE
IF
NECESSARY
THE

SHOWED
A
STRIKING
SIGN
OF
THE
DISINTEGRATION
OF
THE
SOVIET
ARMED
FORCES
BECAUSE
OUR

WAS
A
RUSSIAN
OFFICER
AN
AZERBAIJANI
OFFICIAL
TOLD
US
THAT
THERE
WERE
NOW
FIVE
FORMER
SOVIET
MILITARY
HELICOPTERS

THEY
HAVE
SIGNED
CONTRACTS

SAID
THE

WE
ENGAGED
IN

WAS
MOST
PROBABLY
FLOWN
BY
A
