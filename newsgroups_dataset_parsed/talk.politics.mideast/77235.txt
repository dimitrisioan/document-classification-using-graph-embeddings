MAY
IN

A
REPORTER
WRITES
BUT
LAST
YEAR
IRAN
QUIETLY
TOOK
OVER
FOUR
ISLANDS
BELONGING
TO
THE
UNITED
ARAB
EMIRATES
AND
DEPORTED
THEIR
PEOPLE
WITH
HARDLY
A
PROTEST
FROM
THE
UNITED
STATES
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
THIS
IS
REFERRING
TO
I
SEEM
TO
HAVE
MISSED
IT
SPIKED
NO
DOUBT
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
IN
THE
NYT
AND
OTHER
SOURCES
ABOUT
THIS
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
IT
IS
AN
ONGOING
BORDER
DISUPUTE
AND
WHEN
THE
IRANIANS
KICKED
OUT
THE
UAE
PEOPLE
IT
WAS
BRIEFLY
REPORTED
THIS
WAS
MANY
MOONS
AGO
I
DONT
RECALL
READING
OF
ANY
PUBLIC
US
COMMENT
IF
IT
WERE
A
STRONG
PROTEST
I
PROBABLY
WOULD
HAVE
SEEN
IT
THOSE
ISLANDS
WOULD
BE
ABU
MUSA
AND
THE
GREATER
AND
LESSER
TUNBS
I
PRESUME
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
A
FOURTH
THE
LATTER
TWO
ISLANDS
BELONG
TO
IRAN
AND
SO
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NY
TIMES
THE
ISLANDS
BELONG
TO
THE
UNITED
ARAB
EMIRATES
JAKE
LIVNI
THE
NY
TIMES
IS
IN
ERROR
THIS
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
MY
OPINION
EVEN
THE
ARAB
SOURCES
THAT
I
USE
DO
NOT
MAKE
THIS
CLAIM
THIS
OF
COURSE
IS
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
NY
TIMES
WAS
REFERING
TO
THE
ISLANDS
THAT
I
NAMED
ABOVE
OF
THOSE
ISLANDS
ONLY
ABU
MUSA
HAS
BEEN
IN
DISPUTE
AND
IRANIAN
OCCUPATION
OF
THAT
ISLAND
PREDATES
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
UAE
