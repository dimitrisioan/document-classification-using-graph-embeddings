the
hamas
way
of
death
following
is
a
transcript
of
a
recruitment
and
training
videotape
made
last
summer
by
the
qassam
battalions
the
military
as
opposed
to
israels
many
ways
of
death
using
bombers
and
artillery
against
lebanese
towns
and
villages
using
fire
arms
and
lethal
variants
of
tear
gas
and
rubber
coated
bullets
against
stone
throwers
using
tanks
and
antitank
missiles
against
homes
after
a
minute
evacuation
warning
using
shin
bits
reasonable
physical
pressure
in
interrogation
and
more
not
counting
of
course
past
practices
such
as
the
bombardment
of
beirut
in
the
bombing
of
the
egyptian
school
of
bahrelbakar
and
the
abuzabal
factory
in
the
downing
of
the
libyan
airliner
full
of
egyptian
passengers
near
the
same
time
overseeing
the
maronite
massacre
in
sabra
and
shatilla
that
is
of
course
besides
numerous
massacres
by
irgun
and
other
gangs
during
the
british
mandate
period
ironically
the
same
oped
page
in
the
nyt
times
from
which
the
naftaly
copied
this
article
was
running
another
article
next
to
it
by
am
rosenthall
blaming
bosnian
muslims
for
their
own
genocide
by
effectively
saying
that
it
is
stupid
to
seek
independence
if
independence
will
bring
your
people
slaughter
but
what
else
would
one
expect
from
mr
rosenthall
who
never
wasted
a
chance
to
bash
arabs
or
muslims
