under
such
conditions
it
is
very
easy
for
serbs
to
play
a
divideandconquer
game
and
to
get
the
muslims
and
croats
who
have
strong
common
it
is
the
serbs
who
were
divided
when
croatia
and
bosniahercegovina
attempted
to
secede
from
yugoslavia
ripping
more
than
serbs
and
their
property
out
of
yugoslavia
the
croatian
and
muslim
nations
had
the
right
to
secede
not
the
republics
additionally
the
secessions
were
to
be
negotiated
which
would
probably
have
required
international
mediation
instead
the
secessions
were
illegal
unilateral
and
acts
of
war
against
yugoslavia
and
those
who
did
not
want
to
be
ripped
out
of
yugoslavia
by
the
secessions
