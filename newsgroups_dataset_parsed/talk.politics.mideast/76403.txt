get
thee

writes
now
i
have
a
comment
concerning
israeli
terrorism
during
the
and
the
hirgun
and
other
branch
off
militant
groups
did
fight
the
british
do
get
them
out
of
palestine
yet
i
fail
to
see
how
this
israeli
form
of
terrorism
was
better
than
the
terrorism
practiced
now
by
the
arabs
these
jewish
terrorist
groups
killed
innocent
british
soldiers
but
not
only
thta
also
killed
many
jews
who
were
in
favor
of
a
compromise
with
the
palestinians
the
irgun
killed
soldiers
which
is
a
legitimate
way
to
drive
an
unwanted
fogriend
regime
from
a
country
they
didnt
kill
blindly
their
families
or
such
not
as
a
policy
i
agree
that
brits
which
were
not
soldiers
also
were
killed
sometimes
nor
they
killed
arabs
just
for
being
arabs
in
case
i
have
to
remind
you
the
difference
the
majority
of
the
attacks
of
the
arab
terrorist
organizations
was
on
civilians
they
even
tried
to
justify
their
attacks
by
saying
that
all
jews
in
the
israel
served
in
the
army
at
one
point
in
time
or
another
and
therefore
are
legitimate
targets
in
addition
they
massacred
an
entire
palestinian
village
in
contributing
to
the
exodus
of
the
frightened
palestinians
who
feared
their
very
lives
yes
these
exceptions
were
tragic
mistakes
i
wasnt
there
and
dont
have
reffereces
handy
but
from
what
i
heard
your
description
is
a
bit
carried
away
most
of
the
vilagers
fled
with
several
dozens
most
of
them
claimed
to
be
fighters
being
killed
those
massaceres
are
far
from
being
the
rule
considering
that
dozens
if
not
hounders
of
arab
vilages
came
under
israeli
rule
during
the
same
time
period
i
mention
this
not
because
im
anti
semitic
im
part
jewish
but
because
this
self
righteousness
on
the
part
of
the
israelites
pisses
me
off
so
im
not
as
critical
of
the
palestinians
because
they
were
indeed
screwed
over
by
the
jews
it
s
a
damn
shame
that
the
palestinians
had
to
pay
for
german
and
european
anti
semitism
what
do
you
mean
screwed
over
by
the
jews
they
began
the
war
and
didnt
accept
the
arrgenment
planned
by
the
un
what
did
you
expect
the
jews
to
do
pissed
off
at
immature
closeminded
self
righteous
semites
arabs
are
also
semites
