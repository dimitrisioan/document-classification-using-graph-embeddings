TYPICAL

THINKING
IF
WE
ARE
GUILTY
OF
SOMETHING
SO
IS
EVERYONE
ELSE
UNFORTUNATELY
FOR
YOU
NABIL
JEWISH
TRIBES
ARE
NOT
NEARLY
AS
SUSCEPTIBLE
TO
THE
FRATRICIDAL
MURDERING
THAT
IS
STILL
SO
COMMON
AMONG
ARABS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
THERE
WERE
NO
KILLINGS
BETWEEN
THE
JEWISH
TRIBES
ON
THE
WAY
I
DONT
LIKE
THIS
COMMENT
ABOUT
TYPICAL
THINKING
YOU
COULD
STATE
YOUR
INTERPRETATION
OF
EXODUS
WITHOUT
IT
AS
I
READ
EXODUS
I
CAN
SEE
A
LOT
OF
KILLING
THERE
WHICH
IS
PAINTED
BY
THE
AUTHOR
OF
THE
BIBLE
IN
IDEOLOGICALRELIGIOUS
COLORS
THE
HISTORY
IN
THE
DESERT
CAN
BE
SEEN
AS
AN
ETHOS
OF
ANY
NOMADIC
PEOPLE
OCCUPYING
A
LAND
THATS
WHY
I
THINK
IT
IS
A
GREAT
BOOK
WITH
WHICH
DESCENDANTS
ARABS
TURKS
AND
MONGOLS
CAN
UNIFY
AS
WELL
YOU
SOMEHOW
MISSED
NABILS
COMMENTS
EVEN
THOUGH
YOU
INCLUDED
IT
IN
YOUR
FOLLOWUP
THE
NUMBER
WHICH
COULD
HAVE
ARRIVED
TO
THE
HOLY
LANDS
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
SUBSTANTIALLY
LESS
UDE
TO
THE
HARSH
DESERT
AND
THE
KILLINGS
BETWEEN
THE
JEWISH
TRIBES
ON
THE
WAY
I
AM
NOT
AWARE
OF
KILLINGS
BETWEEN
JEWISH
TRIBES
IN
THE
DESERT
THE
POINT
OF
TYPICAL
THINKING
HERE
IS
THAT
WHILE
ARABS
STILL
TODAY
ACT
IN
THE
MANNER
YOU
DESCRIBE
LIKE
ANY
NOMADIC
PEOPLE
OCCUPYING
A
LAND
KILLING
AND
PLUNDERING
EACH
OTHER
WITH
REGULARITY
OTHERS
HAVE
SOMEHOW
PROGRESSED
OVER
TIME
IT
IS
NOT
SURPRISING
THEN
THAT
ARABS
OFTEN
ACCUSE
OTHERS
INFIDELS
OF
THINGS
THAT
THEY
ARE
QUITE
FAMILIAR
WITH
CIVIL
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
RELIGIOUS
DISCRIMINATION
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
LAND
THEFT
TORTURE
AND
MURDER
IT
IS
PRECISELY
THIS
MECHANISM
AT
WORK
THAT
LEADS
PEOPLE
TO
SAY
THAT
JEWISH
TRIBES
WERE
KILLING
EACH
OTHER
IN
THE
DESERT
EVEN
WITHOUT
SUPPORT

SUCH
