TALKS
RESUME
IN

TIM
CLOCK
WRITES
TC
DO
YOU
AS
I
DO
AGREE
THAT
THIS
SORT
OF
PEACE
PROCESS
IS
NEEDED
TC
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PARTICULAR
POINTS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
ARTICLE
IS
WHAT
TC
ISRAEL
IS
SUPPOSEDLY
GOING
TO
PROPOSE
GOOD
DOES
IT
GO
TOO
FAR
TC
NOT
FAR
ENOUGH
TC
IF
YOU
DONT
AGREE
THAT
A
PEACE
PROCESS
IS
NEEDED
WHAT
IS
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
THAT
A
PEACE
PROCESS
IS
NEEDED
SINCE
ONLY
THROUGH
NEGOTIATIONS
WILL
THE
FUTURE
GENERATIONS
BE
ABLE
TO
LIVE
IN
STABILITY
UNFORTUNATELY
NOT
ALL
THINK
LIKE
THIS
WE
HAVE
CASES
LIKE
ANAS
OMRAN
HAMZA
SALEH
JLE
MOHAMMED
REZA
MEHMED
ABUABED
ANWAR
MOHAMMED
AND
OTHERS
WHO
THINK
THAT
JIHAD
IS
THE
ONLY
SOLUTION
I
WISH
THAT
PEOPLE
INCLUDING
MYSELF
WOULD
HAVE
MORE
OBJECTIVE
VIEWS
LIKE
TIM
BASIL
AND
SHAI
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
PUT
THE
RHETORIC
ASIDE
AND
START
DISCUSSING
SUBSTANCE
MY
VIEW
IS
THAT
ISRAEL
HAS
MADE
MORE
GESTURES
TOWARDS
ITS
ARAB
FOES
THAN
THE
OPPOSITE
WHAT
HAVE
THE
SYSRIANS
GIVEN
TO
US
OR
PROPOSED
WHAT
HAVE
THE
PALESTINIANS
PROPOSED
IF
THE
PALESTINIANS
WOULD
JUST
REVOKE
OR
REWRITE
THEIR
CHARTER
OR
JUST
CONDEMN
ACTS
OF
PALESTINIAN
VIOLENCE
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
START
THE
PALESTINIANS
HAVE
ALL
TO
GAIN
FROM
THESE
NEGOTIATIONS
ITS
SEEMS
THOUGH
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
DECISIONS
ON
THEIR
OWN
AND
ARE
PLAGUED
BY
INTERNAL
STRIFE
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
ARE
NOT
GETTING
ANYWHERE
FUNDAMENTALISM
IS
SLOWLY
TAKING
OVER
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
THEN
IT
WILL
BE
TOO
LATE
TO
DISCUSS
ISSUES
WITH
THE
PALESTINIANS
SINCE
THEY
WILL
ONLY
VOW
FOR
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
ISRAEL
ARABS
MUST
TAKE
EXAMPLE
ON
EGYPT
EGYPT
CAME
TO
THE
BARGAINING
TABLE
GOT
WHAT
IT
WANTED
FROM
ISRAEL
AND
THERE
IS
NOW
PEACE
AND
COOPERATION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
COUNTRIES
THE
