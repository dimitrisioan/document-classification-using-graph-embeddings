ABOUT
THE

PAID

NOW
WE
PAID
FOR
IT
IN

THE

TRAGEDY
WE

INTO

AND
AFTER
WE
TALK
LIKE
THAT
THAT
WAS
BEFORE
THE
WAR
LIKE
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WENT
THROUGH
WORLD
WAR
II
AND
CONSIDERED
IT
A
WHOLE
EPOCH
A
FATE
NO

HOW
MANY
YEARS
GO
BY
NO

HOW
LONG
WE
LIVE
IT
WILL
NEVER
BE
FORGOTTEN
ON
THE
CONTRARY
SOME
OF
THE
MOMENTS
BECOME
EVEN
SHARPER
IN
OUR
RAGE
IN
OUR
SORROW
WE
SAW
EVERYTHING
DIFFERENTLY
BUT
NOW
THEY
SAY
THAT
YOU
CAN
SEE
MORE
WITH
DISTANCE
AND
WE
CAN
SEE
THOSE
INHUMAN
EVENTS
WITH
MORE
CLARITY
NOW
WE
MORE
ACUTELY
PERCEIVE
OUR
LOSSES
AND
EVERYTHING
THAT
HAPPENED
NINETEEN
EIGHTYEIGHT
WAS
A
LEAP
YEAR
EVERYONE
FEARS
A
LEAP
YEAR
AND
WANTS
IT
TO
PASS
AS
QUICKLY
AS
POSSIBLE
YET
WE
NEVER
THOUGHT
THAT
THAT
LEAP
YEAR
WOULD
BE
SUCH
A
BLACK
ONE
FOR
EVERY
SUMGAIT
ARMENIAN
THOSE
WHO
LOST
SOMEONE
AND
THOSE
WHO
DIDNT
THAT
SECOND
TO
LAST
DAY
OF
WINTER
WAS
ORDINARY
FOR
OUR
FAMILY
ALTHOUGH
YOU
COULD
ALREADY
SMELL
DANGER
IN
THE
AIR
BUT
WE
DIDNT
THINK
THAT
THE
DANGER
WAS
NEAR
AND
POSSIBLE
SO
WE
DIDNT
TAKE
ANY
STEPS
TO
SAVE
OURSELVES
AT
LEAST
AS
MY
PARENTS
SAY
AT
LEAST
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
DONE
SOMETHING
TO
SAVE
THE
CHILDREN
MY
PARENTS
THEMSELVES
ARE
NOT
THAT
OLD
AND
YEARS
BUT
THEN
THEY
THOUGHT
THAT
THEY
HAD
ALREADY
LIVED
ENOUGH
AND
DID
EVERYTHING
THEY
COULD
TO
SAVE
US
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
THE
TRAGEDY
STARTED
ON
FEBRUARY
AROUND
FIVE
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
I
CALL
IT
A
TRAGEDY
AND
I
REPEAT
IT
WAS
A
TRAGEDY
EVEN
THOUGH
ALL
OUR
FAMILY
SURVIVED
WHEN
I
RECALL
HOW
THEY
BROKE
DOWN
OUR
DOOR
MY
SKIN
CRAWLS
EVEN
NOW
AMONG
ARMENIANS
AMONG
PEOPLE
WHO
WISH
ME
ONLY
WELL
I
FEEL
LIKE
ITS
ALL
STARTING
OVER
AGAIN
I
REMEMBER
HOW
THAT
MOB
BROKE
INTO
OUR
APARTMENT
MY
PARENTS
WERE
STANDING
IN
THE
HALL
MY
FATHER
HAD
AN
AXE
IN
HIS
HANDS
AND
HAD
IMMEDIATELY
LOCKED
BOTH
OF
THE
DOORS
OUR
DOOR
WAS
RARELY
LOCKED
SINCE
FRIENDS
AND
NEIGHBORS
OFTEN
DROPPED
BY
WERE
KNOWN
AS
A
HOSPITABLE
FAMILY
AND
WE
JUST
NEVER
REALLY
THOUGHT
ABOUT
WHETHER
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
COMING
TO
SEE
US
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
JEWS
OR
RUSSIANS
WE
HAD
FRIENDS
OF
MANY
NATIONALITIES
EVEN
A
TURKMEN
WOMAN
MY
PARENTS
WERE
IN
THE
HALL
MY
FATHER
WITH
AN
AXE
I
REMEMBER
HIM
TELLING
MY
MOTHER
RUN
TO
THE
KITCHEN
FOR
A
KNIFE
BUT
MOTHER
WAS
DETACHED
PALE
AS
THOUGH
SHE
HAD
DECIDED
TO
SELL
HER
LIFE
A
BIT
DEARER
TO
BE
HONEST
I
NEVER
EXPECTED
IT
OF
HER
SHES
AFRAID
OF
GETTING
SHOT
AND
AFRAID
OF
THE
DARK
A
GIRLFRIEND
WAS
AT
THE
HOUSE
THAT
DAY
A
RUSSIAN
GIRL
LYUDA
AND
MAMMA
SAID
NO
MATTER
WHAT
HAPPENS
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THEY
DO
TO
US
YOURE
NOT
TO
COME
OUT
OF
THE
BEDROOM
WERE
GOING
TO
TELL
THEM
THAT
WERE
ALONE
IN
THE
APARTMENT
WE
WENT
INTO
THE
BEDROOM
THERE
WERE
FOUR
OF
US
MARINA
AND
THE
RUSSIAN
GIRL
CRAWLED
UNDER
THE
BED
AND
WE
COVERED
THEM
UP
WITH
A
RUG
BOXES
OF
DISHES
AND
KARINA
AND
I
ARE
STANDING
THERE
AND
LOOKING
AT
ONE
ANOTHER
THE
IDEA
THAT
PERHAPS
WE
WERE
SEEING
EACH
OTHER
FOR
THE
LAST
TIME
FLASHED
SOMEWHERE
INSIDE
ME
IM
AN
EMOTIONAL
PERSON
AND
I
EXPRESS
MY
EMOTIONS
IMMEDIATELY
I
WANTED
TO
EMBRACE
HER
AND
KISS
HER
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
THE
LAST
SECOND
AND
MAYBE
KARINA
WAS
THINKING
THE
SAME
THING
BUT
SHES
QUITE
RESERVED
WE
DIDNT
HAVE
TIME
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
TO
EACH
OTHER
BECAUSE
WE
IMMEDIATELY
HEARD
MAMMA
RAISE
A
SHOUT
THERE
WAS
SO
MUCH
NOISE
FROM
THE
TRAMPING
OF
FEET
FROM
THE
SHOUTING
AND
FROM
EXCITED
VOICES
I
COULDNT
FIGURE
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
OUT
THERE
BECAUSE
THE
DOOR
TO
THE
BEDROOM
WAS
ONLY
OPEN
A
CRACK
BUT
WHEN
MAMMA
SHOUTED
THE
SECOND
TIME
KARINA
RAN
OUT
OF
THE
BEDROOM
I
RAN
AFTER
HER
I
HAD
WANTED
TO
HOLD
HER
BACK
BUT
WHEN
SHE
OPENED
THE
DOOR
AND
RAN
OUT
INTO
THE
HALL
THEY
SAW
US
IMMEDIATELY
THE
ONLY
THING
I
MANAGED
TO
DO
WAS
CLOSE
THE
DOOR
BEHIND
ME
AT
LEAST
SO
AS
TO
SAVE
MARINA
AND
HER
FRIEND
THE
MOB
WAS
SHOUTING
ALL
OF
THEIR
EYES
WERE
SHINING
ALL
RED
LIKE
FROM
INSOMNIA
AT
FIRST
ABOUT
PEOPLE
BURST
IN
BUT
LATER
I
WAS
STANDING
WITH
MY
BACK
TO
THE
DOOR
AND
COULDNT
SEE
THEY
CAME
INTO
THE
HALL
INTO
THE
KITCHEN
AND
DRAGGED
MY
FATHER
INTO
THE
OTHER
ROOM
HE
DIDNT
UTTER
A
WORD
HE
JUST
RAISED
THE
AXE
TO
HIT
THEM
BUT
MAMMA
SNATCHED
THE
AXE
FROM
BEHIND
AND
SAID
TELL
THEM
NOT
TO
TOUCH
THE
CHILDREN
TELL
THEM
THEY
CAN
DO
AS
THEY
WANT
WITH
US
BUT
NOT
TO
HARM
THE
CHILDREN
SHE
SAID
THIS
TO
FATHER
IN
ARMENIAN
THERE
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
FROM
ARMENIA
AMONG
THE
MOB
WHO
BROKE
IN
THEY
UNDERSTOOD
ARMENIAN
PERFECTLY
THE
LOCAL
AZERBAIJANIS
DONT
KNOW
ARMENIAN
THEY
DONT
NEED
TO
SPEAK
IT
AND
ONE
OF
THEM
RESPONDED
IN
ARMENIAN
YOU
AND
YOUR
CHILDREN
BOTH
WERE
GOING
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THING
TO
YOU
AND
YOUR
CHILDREN
THAT
YOU
ARMENIANS
DID
IN
KAFAN
THEY
KILLED
OUR
WOMEN
OUR
GIRLS
OUR
MOTHERS
THEY
CUT
THEIR
BREASTS
OFF
AND
BURNED
OUR
HOUSES
AND
SO
ON
AND
SO
FORTH
AND
WE
CAME
TO
DO
THE
SAME
THING
TO
YOU
THIS
WHOLE
TIME
SOME
OF
THEM
ARE
DESTROYING
THE
HOUSE
AND
THE
OTHERS
ARE
SHOUTING
AT
US
THEY
WERE
MOSTLY
YOUNG
PEOPLE
UNDER
AT
FIRST
THERE
WERENT
ANY
OLDER
PEOPLE
AMONG
THEM
AND
ALL
OF
THEIR
FACES
WERE
UNFAMILIAR
SUMGAIT
IS
A
SMALL
TOWN
ALL
THE
SAME
AND
WE
KNOW
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
BY
THEIR
FACES
ESPECIALLY
ME
IM
A
TEACHER
SO
THEY
DRAGGED
MY
FATHER
INTO
THE
OTHER
ROOM
THEY
TWISTED
HIS
ARMS
AND
TOOK
HIM
IN
THERE
NO
THEY
DIDNT
TAKE
HIM
IN
THERE
THEY
DRAGGED
HIM
IN
THERE
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
ALREADY
UNABLE
TO
WALK
THEY
CLOSED
THE
DOOR
TO
THAT
ROOM
ALL
BUT
A
CRACK
WE
COULDNT
SEE
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
TO
FATHER
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
TO
HIM
THEN
A
YOUNG
MAN
ABOUT
YEARS
OLD
STARTED
TO
TEAR
OFF
MAMMAS
SARAFAN
AND
MAMMA
SHOUTED
AT
HIM
IN
AZERBAIJANI
IM
OLD
ENOUGH
TO
BE
YOUR
MOTHER
WHAT
ARE
YOU
DOING
HE
STRUCK
HER
NOW
HES
BEING
HELD
MAMMA
IDENTIFIED
HIM
I
HOPE
HES
CONVICTED
THEN
THEY
WENT
AFTER
KARINA
WHOS
BEEN
TALKING
TO
THEM
LIKE
A
KOMSOMOL
LEADER
AS
THOUGH
SHE
WERE
TRYING
TO
LEAD
THEM
DOWN
A
DIFFERENT
PATH
AS
THEY
SAY
TO
INFLUENCE
THEIR
CONSCIOUSNESS
SHE
TOLD
THEM
THAT
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
WAS
WRONG
THAT
THEY
MUSTNT
DO
IT
SHE
SAID
COME
ON
LETS
STRAIGHTEN
THIS
OUT
WITHOUT
EMOTIONS
WHAT
DO
YOU
WANT
WHO
ARE
YOU
WHY
DID
YOU
COME
HERE
WHAT
DID
WE
EVER
DO
TO
YOU
SOMEONE
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
WHO
THEY
WERE
AND
WHY
THEY
HAD
COME
INTO
OUR
HOME
BUT
THEN
THE
ONES
IN
THE
BACKMORE
OF
THEM
KEPT
COMING
AND
COMINGSAID
WHAT
ARE
YOU
TALKING
TO
THEM
FOR
YOU
SHOULD
KILL
THEM
WE
CAME
HERE
TO
KILL
THEM
THEY
PUSHED
KARINA
STRUCK
HER
AND
SHE
FELL
DOWN
THEY
BEAT
HER
BUT
SHE
DIDNT
CRY
OUT
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
TORE
HER
CLOTHES
OFF
SHE
KEPT
REPEATING
WHAT
DID
WE
DO
TO
YOU
WHAT
DID
WE
DO
TO
YOU
AND
EVEN
LATER
WHEN
SHE
CAME
TO
SHE
SAID
MAMMA
WHAT
DID
WE
DO
TO
THEM
WHY
DID
THEY
DO
THAT
TO
US
THAT
GROUP
WAS
PREPARED
I
KNOW
THIS
BECAUSE
I
NOTICED
THAT
SOME
OF
THEM
ONLY
BROKE
UP
FURNITURE
AND
OTHERS
ONLY
DEALT
WITH
US
I
REMEMBER
THAT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BEATING
ME
WHEN
THEY
WERE
TEARING
MY
CLOTHES
OFF
I
FELT
NEITHER
PAIN
NOR
SHAME
BECAUSE
MY
ENTIRE
ATTENTION
WAS
RIVETED
TO
KARINA
ALL
I
COULD
DO
WAS
WATCH
HOW
MUCH
THEY
BEAT
HER
AND
HOW
PAINFUL
IT
WAS
FOR
HER
AND
WHAT
THEY
DID
TO
HER
THATS
WHY
I
FELT
NO
PAIN
LATER
WHEN
THEY
CARRIED
KARINA
OFF
THEY
BEAT
HER
SAVAGELY
ITS
REALLY
AMAZING
THAT
SHE
NOT
ONLY
LIVED
BUT
DIDNT
LOSE
HER
MIND
SHE
IS
VERY
BEAUTIFUL
AND
THEY
DID
EVERYTHING
THEY
COULD
TO
DESTROY
HER
BEAUTY
MOSTLY
THEY
BEAT
HER
FACE
WITH
THEIR
FISTS
KICKING
HER
USING
ANYTHING
THEY
COULD
FIND
MAMMA
KARINA
AND
I
WERE
ALL
IN
ONE
ROOM
AND
AGAIN
I
DIDNT
FEEL
ANY
PAIN
JUST
DIDNT
FEEL
ANY
NO
MATTER
HOW
MUCH
THEY
BEAT
ME
NO
MATTER
WHAT
THEY
DID
THEN
ONE
OF
THOSE
CREEPS
SAID
THAT
THERE
WASNT
ENOUGH
ROOM
IN
THE
APARTMENT
THEY
BROKE
UP
THE
BEDS
AND
THE
DESK
AND
MOVED
EVERYTHING
INTO
THE
CORNERS
SO
THERE
WOULD
BE
MORE
ROOM
THEN
SOMEONE
SUGGESTED
LETS
TAKE
HER
OUTSIDE
THOSE
BEASTS
WERE
IN
HEAVEN
THEY
DID
WHAT
THEY
WOULD
DO
EVERY
DAY
IF
THEY
WERENT
AFRAID
OF
THE
AUTHORITIES
THOSE
WERE
THEIR
TRUE
COLORS
AT
THE
TIME
I
THOUGHT
THAT
IN
FACT
THEY
WOULD
ALWAYS
BEHAVE
THAT
WAY
IF
THEY
WERENT
AFRAID
OF
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
TO
THEM
WHEN
THEY
CARRIED
KARINA
OUT
AND
BEAT
MAMMAHER
FACE
WAS
COMPLETELY
COVERED
WITH
BLOODTHATS
WHEN
I
STARTED
TO
FEEL
THE
PAIN
I
BLACKED
OUT
SEVERAL
TIMES
FROM
THE
PAIN
BUT
EACH
MOMENT
THAT
I
HAD
MY
EYES
OPEN
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
I
WERE
RECORDING
IT
ALL
ON
FILM
I
THINK
IM
A
KIND
PERSON
BY
NATURE
BUT
IM
VENGEFUL
ESPECIALLY
IF
SOMEONE
IS
MEAN
TO
ME
AND
I
DONT
DESERVE
IT
I
HOLD
A
GRUDGE
A
LONG
TIME
IF
SOMEONE
INTENTIONALLY
CAUSES
ME
PAIN
AND
EVERY
TIME
I
WOULD
COME
TO
AND
SEE
ONE
OF
THOSE
ANIMALS
ON
TOP
OF
ME
ID
REMEMBER
THEM
AND
ILL
REMEMBER
THEM
FOR
THE
REST
OF
MY
LIFE
EVEN
THOUGH
PEOPLE
TELL
ME
FORGET
YOU
HAVE
TO
FORGET
YOU
HAVE
TO
GO
ON
LIVING
AT
SOME
POINT
I
REMEMBER
THAT
THEY
STOOD
ME
UP
AND
TOLD
ME
SOMETHING
AND
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
I
HURT
ALL
OVERI
HAD
BEEN
BEATEN
TERRIBLYI
FOUND
THE
STRENGTH
IN
MYSELF
TO
INTERFERE
WITH
THEIR
TORTURES
I
REALIZED
THAT
I
HAD
TO
DO
SOMETHING
RESIST
THEM
OR
JUST
LET
THEM
KILL
ME
TO
BRING
MY
SUFFERING
TO
AN
END
I
PUSHED
ONE
OF
THEM
AWAY
HE
WAS
A
REAL
HORSE
I
REMEMBER
NOW
THAT
HES
BEING
HELD
TOO
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
ALL
WAITING
FOR
IT
THEY
SEIZED
ME
AND
TOOK
ME
OUT
ONTO
THE
BALCONY
I
HAD
LONG
HAIR
AND
IT
WAS
STUCK
ALL
OVER
ME
ONE
OF
THE
VERANDA
SHUTTERS
TO
THE
BALCONY
WAS
OPEN
AND
I
REALIZED
THAT
THEY
PLANNED
TO
THROW
ME
OUT
THE
WINDOW
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
ALREADY
PICKED
ME
UP
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
I
WAS
UP
IN
THE
AIR
AS
THOUGH
FOR
THE
LAST
TIME
I
TOOK
A
REALLY
DEEP
BREATH
AND
CLOSED
MY
EYES
AND
SOMEHOW
BRACED
MYSELF
INSIDE
I
SUDDENLY
BECAME
COLD
AS
THOUGH
MY
HEART
HAD
SUNK
INTO
MY
FEET
AND
SUDDENLY
I
FELT
MYSELF
FLYING
I
COULDNT
FIGURE
OUT
IF
I
WAS
REALLY
FLYING
OR
IF
I
JUST
IMAGINED
IT
WHEN
I
CAME
TO
I
THOUGHT
NOW
IM
GOING
TO
SMASH
ON
THE
GROUND
AND
WHEN
IT
DIDNT
HAPPEN
I
OPENED
MY
EYES
AND
REALIZED
THAT
I
WAS
STILL
LYING
ON
THE
FLOOR
AND
SINCE
I
DIDNT
SCREAM
DIDNT
BEG
THEM
AT
ALL
THEY
BECAME
ALL
THE
MORE
WILD
LIKE
WOLVES
THEY
STARTED
TO
TRAMPLE
ME
WITH
THEIR
FEET
SHOES
WITH
HEELS
ON
THEM
AND
IRON
HORSESHOES
LIKE
THEY
HAD
SPE
CIALLY
PUT
THEM
ON
THEN
I
LOST
CONSCIOUSNESS
I
CAME
TO
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMES
AND
WAITED
FOR
DEATH
SUMMONED
IT
BESEECHED
IT
SOME
PEOPLE
ASK
FOR
GOOD
HEALTH
LIFE
HAPPINESS
BUT
AT
THAT
MOMENT
I
DIDNT
NEED
ANY
OF
THOSE
THINGS
I
WAS
SURE
THAT
NONE
OF
US
WOULD
SURVIVE
AND
I
HAD
EVEN
FORGOTTEN
ABOUT
MARINA
AND
IF
NONE
OF
US
WAS
ALIVE
IT
WASNT
WORTH
LIVING
THERE
WAS
A
MOMENT
WHEN
THE
PAIN
WAS
ESPECIALLY
GREAT
I
WITHSTOOD
INHUMAN
PAIN
AND
REALIZED
THAT
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
TORMENT
ME
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
TO
COME
BECAUSE
I
HAD
SHOWED
MYSELF
TO
BE
SO
TENACIOUS
I
STARTED
TO
STRANGLE
MYSELF
AND
WHEN
I
STARTED
TO
WHEEZE
THEY
REALIZED
THAT
WITH
MY
DEATH
I
WAS
GOING
TO
PUT
AN
END
TO
THEIR
PLEASURES
AND
THEY
PULLED
MY
HANDS
FROM
MY
THROAT
THE
PERSON
WHO
INJURED
AND
INSULTED
ME
MOST
PAINFULLY
I
REMEMBER
HIM
VERY
WELL
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
THE
OLDEST
IN
THE
GROUP
HE
LOOKED
AROUND
I
KNOW
THAT
HE
HAS
FOUR
CHILDREN
AND
THAT
HE
CONSIDERS
HIMSELF
AN
IDEAL
FATHER
AND
PERSON
ONE
WHO
WOULD
NEVER
DO
SUCH
A
THING
SOMETHING
CAME
OVER
HIM
THEN
YOU
SEE
EVEN
DURING
THE
INVESTIGATION
HE
ALMOST
CALLED
ME
DAUGHTER
HE
APOLOGIZED
ALTHOUGH
OF
COURSE
HE
KNEW
THAT
ID
NEVER
FORGIVE
HIM
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
I
CAN
NEVER
FORGIVE
I
HAVE
NEVER
INJURED
ANYONE
WITH
MY
BEHAVIOR
WITH
MY
WORDS
OR
WITH
MY
DEEDS
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
PUT
MYSELF
IN
THE
OTHER
PERSONS
SHOES
BUT
THEN
IN
A
MATTER
OF
HOURS
THEY
TRAMPLED
ME
ENTIRELY
I
SHALL
NEVER
FORGET
IT
I
WANTED
TO
DO
MYSELF
IN
THEN
BECAUSE
I
HAD
NOTHING
TO
LOSE
BECAUSE
NO
ONE
COULD
PROTECT
ME
MY
FATHER
WHO
TRIED
TO
DO
SOMETHING
AGAINST
THAT
HOARD
OF
BEASTS
BY
HIMSELF
COULD
DO
NOTHING
AND
WOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
ANYTHING
I
KNEW
THAT
I
WAS
EVEN
SURE
THAT
HE
WAS
NO
LONGER
ALIVE
AND
IRA
MELKUMIAN
MY
ACQUAINTANCE
I
KNEW
HER
AND
HAD
BEEN
TO
SEE
HER
FAMILY
A
COUPLE
OF
TIMESHER
BROTHER
TRIED
TO
SAVE
HER
AND
COULDNT
SO
HE
TRIED
TO
KILL
HER
HIS
VERY
OWN
SISTER
HE
THREW
AN
AXE
AT
HER
TO
KILL
HER
AND
PUT
AN
END
TO
HER
SUFFERING
WHEN
THEY
STRIPPED
HER
CLOTHES
OFF
AND
CARRIED
HER
INTO
THE
OTHER
ROOM
HER
BROTHER
KNEW
WHAT
AWAITED
HER
I
DONT
KNOW
WHICH
ONE
IT
WAS
EDIK
OR
IGOR
BOTH
OF
THEM
WERE
IN
THE
ROOM
FROM
WHICH
THE
AXE
WAS
THROWN
BUT
THE
AXE
HIT
ONE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
CARRYING
HER
AND
SO
THEY
KILLED
HER
AND
MADE
HER
DEATH
EVEN
MORE
EXCRUCIATING
MAYBE
THE
MOST
EXCRUCIATING
OF
ALL
THE
DEATHS
OF
THOSE
DAYS
IN
SUMGAIT
I
HEARD
ABOUT
IT
ALL
FROM
THE
NEIGHBOR
FROM
THE
MELKUMIANS
LANDING
HIS
NAME
IS
MAKHADDIN
HE
KNOWS
MY
FAMILY
A
LITTLE
HE
CAME
TO
SEE
HOW
WE
HAD
GOTTEN
SETTLED
IN
THE
NEW
APARTMENT
IN
BAKU
HOW
WE
WERE
FEELING
AND
IF
WE
NEEDED
ANYTHING
HES
A
GOOD
PERSON
HE
SAID
YOU
SHOULD
PRAISE
GOD
THAT
YOU
ALL
SURVIVED
BUT
WHAT
I
SAW
WITH
MY
OWN
EYES
I
A
MAN
WHO
HAS
SEEN
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
DIE
WHO
HAS
LIVED
A
WHOLE
LIFE
I
HE
SAYS
NEARLY
LOST
MY
MIND
THAT
DAY
I
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
THE
LIKES
OF
IT
AND
THINK
I
NEVER
SHALL
AGAIN
THE
DOOR
TO
HIS
APARTMENT
WAS
OPEN
AND
HE
SAW
EVERYTHING
ONE
OF
THE
BROTHERS
THREW
THE
AXE
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
ALREADY
TAKEN
THE
FATHER
AND
MOTHER
OUT
OF
THE
APARTMENT
IGOR
EDIK
AND
IRA
REMAINED
HE
SAW
IRA
NAKED
BEING
CARRIED
INTO
THE
OTHER
ROOM
IN
THE
HANDS
OF
SIX
OR
SEVEN
PEOPLE
HE
TOLD
US
ABOUT
IT
AND
SAID
HE
WOULD
NEVER
FORGET
IT
HE
HEARD
THE
BROTHERS
SHOUTING
SOMETHING
INARTICULATE
FROM
PAIN
RAGE
AND
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
WERE
POWERLESS
TO
DO
ANYTHING
BUT
ALL
THE
SAME
THEY
TRIED
TO
DO
SOMETHING
THE
GUY
WHO
GOT
HIT
WITH
THE
AXE
LIVED
I
I
AFTER
I
HAD
BEEN
UNSUCCESSFUL
AT
KILLING
MYSELF
I
SAW
THEM
TAKING
MARINA
AND
LYUDA
OUT
OF
THE
BEDROOM
I
WAS
IN
SUCH
A
STATE
THAT
I
COULDNT
EVEN
REMEMBER
MY
SISTERS
NAME
I
WANTED
TO
CRY
MARINA
OUT
TO
HER
BUT
COULD
NOT
I
LOOKED
AT
HER
AND
KNEW
THAT
IT
WAS
A
FAMILIAR
DEAR
FACE
BUT
COULDNT
FOR
THE
LIFE
OF
ME
REMEMBER
WHAT
HER
NAME
WAS
AND
WHO
SHE
WAS
AND
THUS
I
SAVED
HER
BECAUSE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
TAKING
HER
OUT
SHE
AS
IT
TURNS
OUT
HAD
TOLD
THEM
THAT
SHE
HAD
JUST
BEEN
VISITING
AND
THAT
SHE
AND
LYUDA
WERE
BOTH
THERE
BY
CHANCE
THAT
THEY
WERENT
ARMENIANS
LYUDAS
A
RUSSIAN
YOU
CAN
TELL
RIGHT
AWAY
AND
MARINA
SPEAKS
AZERBAIJANI
WONDERFULLY
AND
SHE
TOLD
THEM
THAT
SHE
WAS
AN
AZERBAIJANI
AND
I
ALMOST
GAVE
HER
AWAY
AND
DOOMED
HER
IM
GLAD
THAT
AT
LEAST
MARINA
CAME
OUT
OF
THIS
ALL
IN
GOOD
PHYSICAL
HEALTH
ALTHOUGH
HER
SPIRIT
WAS
MURDERED
AT
SOME
POINT
I
CAME
TO
AND
SAW
IGOR
IGOR
AGAYEV
MY
ACQUAINTANCE
IN
THAT
MOB
HE
LIVES
IN
THE
NEIGHBORING
BUILDING
FOR
SOME
REASON
I
REMEMBERED
HIS
NAME
MAYBE
I
SENSED
MY
DEFENSE
IN
HIM
I
CALLED
OUT
TO
HIM
IN
RUSSIAN
IGOR
HELP
BUT
HE
TURNED
AWAY
AND
WENT
INTO
THE
BEDROOM
JUST
THEN
THEY
WERE
TAKING
MARINA
AND
LYUDA
OUT
OF
THE
BEDROOM
IGOR
SAID
HE
KNEW
MARINA
AND
LYUDA
THAT
MARINA
IN
FACT
WAS
AZERBAIJANI
AND
HE
TOOK
BOTH
OF
THEM
TO
THE
NEIGHBORS
AND
THE
IDEA
STOLE
THROUGH
ME
THAT
MAYBE
IGOR
HAD
LED
THEM
TO
OUR
APARTMENT
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
BUT
IF
HE
WAS
MY
FRIEND
HE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
SAVE
ME
THEN
THEY
WERE
STRIKING
ME
VERY
HARDWE
HAVE
AN
INDIAN
VASE
A
METAL
ONE
THEY
WERE
HITTING
ME
ON
THE
BACK
WITH
IT
AND
I
BLACKED
OUTTHEY
TOOK
ME
OUT
ONTO
THE
BALCONY
A
SECOND
TIME
TO
THROW
ME
OUT
THE
WINDOW
THEY
WERE
ALREADY
SURE
THAT
I
WAS
DEAD
BECAUSE
I
DIDNT
REACT
AT
ALL
TO
THE
NEW
BLOWS
SOMEONE
SAID
SHES
ALREADY
DEAD
LETS
THROW
HER
OUT
WHEN
THEY
CARRIED
ME
OUT
ONTO
THE
BALCONY
FOR
THE
SECOND
TIME
WHEN
I
WAS
ABOUT
TO
DIE
THE
SECOND
TIME
I
HEARD
SOMEONE
SAY
IN
AZERBAIJANI
DONT
KILL
HER
I
KNOW
HER
SHES
A
TEACHER
I
CAN
STILL
HEAR
THAT
VOICE
RINGING
IN
MY
EARS
BUT
I
CANT
REMEMBER
WHOSE
VOICE
IT
WAS
IT
WASNT
IGOR
BECAUSE
HE
SPEAKS
AZERBAIJANI
WITH
AN
ACCENT
HIS
MOTHER
IS
RUSSIAN
AND
THEY
SPEAK
RUSSIAN
AT
HOME
HE
SPEAKS
AZERBAIJANI
WORSE
THAN
OUR
MARINA
DOES
I
REMEMBER
WHEN
THEY
CARRIED
ME
IN
AND
THREW
ME
ON
THE
BED
HE
CAME
UP
TO
ME
THAT
PERSON
AND
I
HAVING
OPENED
MY
EYES
SAW
AND
RECOGNIZED
THAT
PERSON
BUT
IMMEDIATELY
PASSED
OUT
COLD
I
HAD
BEEN
BEATEN
SO
MUCH
THAT
I
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
STRENGTH
TO
REMEMBER
HIM
I
ONLY
REMEMBER
THAT
THIS
PERSON
WAS
OLDER
AND
HE
HAD
A
HIGH
POSITION
UNFORTUNATELY
I
CANT
REMEMBER
ANYTHING
MORE
WHAT
SHOULD
I
SAY
ABOUT
IGOR
HE
DIDNT
TREAT
ME
BADLY
I
HAD
HEARD
A
LOT
ABOUT
HIM
THAT
HE
WASNT
THAT
GOOD
A
PERSON
THAT
HE
SOMETIMES
DRANK
TOO
MUCH
ONCE
HE
BOASTED
TO
ME
THAT
HE
HAD
SERVED
IN
AFGHANISTAN
HE
KNEW
THAT
WOMEN
USUALLY
LIKE
BRAVERY
IN
A
MAN
ESPECIALLY
IF
A
MAN
WAS
IN
AFGHANISTAN
IF
HE
WAS
WOUNDED
THEN
ITS
ABOUT
EIGHTY
PERCENT
SURE
THAT
HE
WILL
BE
TREATED
VERY
SYMPATHETICALLY
WITH
RESPECT
LATER
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
HE
HAD
SERVED
IN
UFA
AND
WAS
INJURED
BUT
THATS
NOT
IN
AFGHANISTAN
OF
COURSE
I
FOUND
THAT
ALL
OUT
LATER
AMONG
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
MY
KARINA
ALSO
SAW
THE
SECRETARY
OF
THE
PARTY
ORGANIZATION
I
DONT
KNOW
HIS
LAST
NAME
HIS
FIRST
NAME
IS
NAJAF
HE
IS
AN
ARMENIANBORN
AZERBAIJANI
BUT
LATER
KARINA
WASNT
SO
SURE
SHE
WAS
NO
LONGER
A
HUNDRED
PERCENT
SURE
THAT
IT
WAS
HE
SHE
SAW
AND
SHE
DIDNT
WANT
TO
ENDANGER
HIM
SHE
SAID
HE
WAS
THERE
AND
A
LITTLE
WHILE
LATER
MAYBE
THEY
BEAT
ME
SO
MUCH
THAT
I
AM
CONFUSING
HIM
WITH
SOMEONE
ELSE
NO
IT
SEEMS
LIKE
IT
WAS
HE
I
AM
SURE
IT
WAS
HE
BECAUSE
WHEN
HE
CAME
TO
SEE
US
THE
FIRST
TIME
HE
SAID
ONE
THING
AND
THE
NEXT
TIME
HE
SAID
SOMETHING
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
THE
INVESTIGATORS
HAVENT
SUMMONED
HIM
YET
HE
CAME
TO
SEE
US
IN
THE
KHIMIK
BOARDING
HOUSE
WHERE
WE
WERE
LIVING
AT
THE
TIME
HE
BROUGHT
GROCERIES
AND
FLOWERS
THIS
WAS
RIGHT
BEFORE
MARCH
HE
ALMOST
STARTED
CRYING
HE
WAS
SO
UPSET
TO
SEE
OUR
CONDITION
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
HE
WAS
PUTTING
US
ON
OR
NOT
BUT
LATER
AFTER
WE
HAD
TOLD
THE
INVESTIGATOR
AND
THEY
SUMMONED
HIM
TO
THE
PROCURACY
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
IN
BAKU
HE
WASNT
IN
SUMGAIT
THE
FACT
THAT
HE
CHANGED
HIS
TESTIMONY
LEADS
ME
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
KARINA
IS
RIGHT
THAT
IN
FACT
IT
WAS
HE
WHO
WAS
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
THE
INVESTIGATORS
ARE
NOW
TREATING
HIM
AT
ONE
POINT
I
WONDERED
AND
ASKED
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
HE
HAD
AN
ALIBI
AND
WAS
NOT
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
COULDNT
HE
HAVE
GONE
TO
BAKU
AND
ARRANGED
AN
ALIBI
IM
NOT
RULING
OUT
THAT
POSSIBILITY
ILL
NOW
RETURN
TO
OUR
APARTMENT
MAMMA

WERE
MARRIED
HER
WEDDING
BAND
AND
HER
WATCH

GOLD
SHE
BOUGHT
HER
OWN
AND
HER
HUSBANDS
LIVES
WITH
THEM
SHE
GAVE
THE
GOLD
TO
A
OLD
BOY
VADIM
VOROBYEV
A
RUSSIAN
BOY
HE
SPEAKS
AZERBAIJANI
PERFECTLY
HES
AN
ORPHAN
WHO
WAS
RAISED
BY
HIS
GRANDFATHER
AND
WHO
LIVES
IN
SUMGAIT
ON
NIZAMI
STREET
HE
GOES
TO
A
SPECIAL
SCHOOL
ONE
FOR
MENTALLY
HANDICAPPED
CHILDREN
BUT
ILL
SAY
THISIM
A
TEACHER
ALL
THE
SAME
AND
IN
A
MATTER
OF
MINUTES
I
CAN
FORM
AN
OPINIONTHAT
BOY

NOT
AT
ALL
MENTALLY
HANDICAPPED
HES
HEALTHY
HE
CAN
THINK
JUST
FINE
AND
ANALYZE
TOO
POLICEMEN
SHOULD
BE
SO
LUCKY
AND
HES
CUNNING
TOO
AFTER
THAT
HE
WENT
HOME
AND
TORE
ALL
OF
THE
PICTURES
OUT
OF
HIS
PHOTO
ALBUM
HE
BEAT
MAMMA
AND
DEMANDED
GOLD
SAYING
LADY
IF
YOU

ALL
THE
GOLD
AND
MONEY
IN
YOUR
APARTMENT
WELL

YOU
LIVE
AND
MAMMA
TOLD

COMPREHEND
ANYTHING

WAS
COVERED
WITH
BLACK
AND
BLUE
MAMMA
PULLED
THE
GAG
OUT
OF
HIS
MOUTH
IT
WAS
SOME
SORT
OF
CLOTH

I
WAS
LEFT
ALL
ALONE
AND
AT
THAT
MOMENT
I
BECAME
SOMEONE
ELSE
DO
YOU
UNDERSTAND
EVEN
THOUGH
I
KNEW
THAT
NEITHER
MOTHER
AND
FATHER
IN
THE
OTHER
ROOM
NOR
MARINA

COULD
SAVE
ME

WENT
ON
FIGHTING
THEM
I
BIT
SOMEONE

KARINA
WHAT
KIND
OF
PEOPLE

I
WAS
ABOUT

THAT
ALL
OF

TOOK
HEART
WHEN

SAW
THE
YOUNG

DIDNT
KNOW
HIS
NAME
BUT
WE
WOULD
GREET

HIM
THATS
WHEN
HE
GRABBED
THE
AXE
THE
AXE
THAT
HAD
BEEN
TAKEN
FROM
MY
FATHER
I
AUTOMATICALLY
FELL
TO
MY
KNEES
AND
RAISED
MY
HANDS
TO
TAKE
THE
BLOW
OF
THE
AXE
ALTHOUGH
AT
THE
TIME
IT
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BETTER
IF
HE
HAD
STRUCK
ME
IN
THE
HEAD
WITH
THE
AXE
AND
PUT
ME
OUT
OF
MY
MISERY
WHEN
HE
STARTED
GETTING
READY

IN
HIS

PEARL
EARRINGS
ONAND
RIPPED
IT
OUT
TEARING
THE
EARLOBE
THE
OTHER
EARRING
WAS
STILL
THERE
WHEN
IM
NERVOUS
I
FIX
MY
HAIR
CONSTANTLY
AND
THEN
WHEN
I
TOUCHED
MY

I
NOTICED
THAT
I
HAD
ONE
EARRING
ON
I
TOOK
IT
OUT
AND
GAVE
IT
TO
HER
SHE
TOOK
THE
EARRING
BUT
SHE
LED
ME
OUT
OF
THE
APARTMENT
I
WENT
OUT
AND
DIDNT
KNOW
WHERE
TO
GO
I
HEARD
SOMEONE
GOING
UPSTAIRS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHO
IT
WAS
BUT
ASSUMED
IT
WAS
THEM
WITH
TREMENDOUS
DIFFICULTY
I
END
UP
TO
OUR
APARTMENT
I
WANTED
TO
DIE
IN
MY
OWN
HOME
I
GO
INTO
THE
APARTMENT
AND
HEAR
THAT
THEY
ARE
COMING
UP
TO
OUR
PLACE
TO
THE
FIFTH
FLOOR
I
HAD
TO
DO
SOMETHING
I
WENT
INTO
THE
BEDROOM
WHERE
MARINA
AND
LYUDA
HAD
HIDDEN
AND
SAW
THAT
THE
BED
WAS
OVERTURNED
INSTEAD
OF
HIDING
I
SQUATTED
NEAR
SOME
BROKEN
CHRISTMAS
ORNAMENTS
FOUND
AN
UNBROKEN
ONE
AND
STARTED
SOBBING
THEN
THEY
CAME
IN
SOMEONE
SAID
THAT
THERE
WERE
STILL
SOME
THINGS
TO
TAKE
I
THINK
THAT
SOMEONE
PUSHED
ME
UNDER
THE
BED
I
LAY
ON
THE
FLOOR
AND
THERE
WERE
BROKEN
ORNAMENTS
ON
IT
UNDER
MY
HEAD
AND
LEGS
I
GOT
ALL
CUT
UP
BUT
I
LAY
THERE
WITHOUT
MOVING
MY
HEART
WAS
BEATING
SO
HARD
IT
SEEMED
THE
WHOLE
TOWN
COULD
HEAR
IT
THERE
WERE
NO
LIGHTS
ON
MAYBE
THATS
WHAT
SAVED
ME
THEY
WERE
BURNING
MATCHES
AND
TOWARD
THE
END
THEY
BROUGHT
IN
A
CANDLE
THEY
STARTED
PICKING
OUT
THE
CLOTHES
THAT
COULD
STILL
BE
WORN
THEY
TOOK
FATHERS
SPORT
JACKET
AND
A
BEDSPREAD
THE
END
OF
WHICH
WAS
UNDER
MY
HEAD
THEY
PULLED
ON
THE
ONE
END
AND
IT
FELT
LIKE
THEY
WERE
PULLING
MY
HAIR
OUT
I
ALMOST
CRIED
OUT
AND
AGAIN
I
REALIZED
I
WASNT
GETTING
OUT
OF
THERE
ALIVE
AND
I
STARTED
TO
STRANGLE
MYSELF
AGAIN
I
TOOK
MY
THROAT
IN
ONE
HAND
AND
PRESSED
THE
OTHER
ON
MY
MOUTH
SO
AS
NOT
TO
WHEEZE
SO
THAT
I
WOULD
DIE
AND
THEY
WOULD
ONLY
FIND
ME
AFTERWARD
THEY
WERE
THROWING
THE
BURNED
MATCHES
UNDER
THE
BED
AND
I
GOT
BURNED
BUT
I
WITHSTOOD
IT
SOMETHING
INSIDE
OF
ME
HELD
ON
SOMEONES
HAND
WAS
PROTECTING
ME
TO
THE
END
I
KNEW
THAT
I
WAS
GOING
TO
DIE
BUT
I
DIDNT
KNOW
HOW
I
KNEW
THAT
IF
I
SURVIVED
I
WOULD
WALK
OUT
OF
THAT
APARTMENT
BUT
IF
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
ONE
OF
MY
FAMILY
HAD
DIED
I
WOULD
DIE
FOR
SURE
BECAUSE
I
HAD
NEVER
BEEN
SO
CLOSE
TO
DEATH
AND
COULDNT
IMAGINE
HOW
YOU
COULD
GO
ON
LIVING
WITHOUT
YOUR
MOTHER
OR
FATHER
OR
WITHOUT
YOUR
SISTER
MARINA
I
THOUGHT
WAS
STILL
ALIVE
SHE
WENT
TO
LYUDAS
PLACE
OR
SOMEONE
IS
HIDING
HER
I
TRIED
TO
THINK
THAT
IGOR
WOULDNT
LET
THEM
BE
KILLED
HE
SERVED
IN
AFGHANISTAN
HE
SHOULD
PROTECT
HER
WHILE
I
WAS
STRANGLING
MYSELF
I
SAID
MY
GOODBYES
TO
EVERYONE
AND
THEN
I
THOUGHT
HOW
COULD
MARINA
SURVIVE
ALONE
IF
THEY
KILLED
ALL
OF
US
HOW
WOULD
SHE
LIVE
ALL
BY
HERSELF
THERE
WERE
SIX
PEOPLE
IN
THE
ROOM
THEY
TALKED
AMONG
THEMSELVES
AND
SMOKED
ONE
TALKED
ABOUT
HIS
DAUGHTER
SAYING
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
CHILDRENS
FOOTWEAR
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
THAT
HE
COULD
TAKE
FOR
HIS
DAUGHTER
ANOTHER
SAID
THAT
HE
LIKED
THE
APARTMENTRECENTLY
WE
HAD
DONE
A
REALLY
GOOD
JOB
FIXING
EVERYTHING
UPAND
THAT
HE
WOULD
LIVE
THERE
AFTER
EVERYTHING
WAS
ALL
OVER
THEY
STARTED
TO
ARGUE
A
THIRD
ONE
SAYS
HOW
COME
YOU
GET
IT
I
HAVE
FOUR
CHILDREN
AND
THERE
ARE
THREE
ROOMS
HERE
THATS
JUST
WHAT
I
NEED
ALL
THESE
YEARS
IVE
BEEN
LIVING
IN
GODAWFUL
PLACES
ANOTHER
ONE
SAYS
NEITHER
OF
YOU
GETS
IT
WELL
SET
FIRE
TO
IT
AND
LEAVE
THEN
SOMEONE
SAID
THAT
AZERBAIJANIS
LIVE
RIGHT
NEXT
DOOR
THE
FIRE
COULD
MOVE
OVER
TO
THEIR
PLACE
AND
THEY
TO
MY
GOOD
FORTUNE
DIDNT
SET
FIRE
TO
THE
APARTMENT
AND
LEFT
OH
YES
I
JUST
REMEMBERED
WHILE
THEY
WERE
RAPING
ME
THEY
REPEATED
QUITE
FREQUENTLY

THE
ARMENIAN
WOMEN
HAVE
BABIES
FOR
US
MUSLIM
BABIES
LET
THEM

AZERBAIJANIS
FOR
