country
turks
and
azeris
consistantly
want
to
drag
armenia
into
the
karabakh
conflict
with
azerbaijan
gimme
a
break
capital
letters
or
not
the
above
is
pure
nonsense
it
seems
to
me
that
short
sighted
armenians
are
escalating
the
hostilities
while
hoping
that
turkey
will
stay
out
stop
and
think
for
a
moment
will
you
armenia
doesnt
need
anyone
to
drag
her
into
the
conflict
it
is
a
part
of
it
the
karabakhiarmenians
who
have
lived
in
their
homeland
for
years
cut
off
from
armenia
and
given
to
azeris
by
stalin
are
the
ones
directly
involved
in
the
conflict
they
are
defending
themselves
against
azeri
aggression
huh
you
didnt
expect
azeris
to
be
friendly
to
forces
fighting
with
them
within
their
borders
at
last
i
hope
that
the
us
insists
that
turkey
stay
out
of
the
karabakh
crisis
so
that
the
repeat
of
the
cyprus
invasion
will
never
occur
again
youre
not
playing
with
a
full
deck
are
you
where
would
turkey
invade
are
you
throwing
the
cyprus
buzzword
around
with
scg
in
the
header
in
hopes
that
the
greek
netters
will
jump
the
gun
yes
indeed
turkey
has
the
military
prowess
to
intervene
what
she
wishes
she
had
however
is
the
diplomatic
power
to
stop
the
hostilities
and
bring
the
parties
to
the
negotiating
table
thats
hard
to
do
when
armenians
are
attacking
azeri
towns
armenian
leaders
are
lacking
the
statesmanship
to
recognize
the
futility
of
armed
conflict
and
convince
their
nation
that
a
compromise
that
leads
to
stability
is
much
better
than
a
military
faits
accomplis
thats
going
to
cause
incessant
skirmishes
think
of
or
years
down
the
line
both
of
the
newly
independent
countries
need
to
develop
economically
and
neither
one
is
going
to
wipe
the
other
out
these
people
will
be
neighbors
would
it
not
be
better
to
keep
the
bad
blood
between
them
minimal
if
you
belong
to
the
armenian
diaspora
keep
in
mind
that
what
strikes
your
fancy
on
the
map
is
costing
the
local
armenians
dearly
in
terms
of
their
blood
and
future
its
easy
to
be
comfortable
abroad
and
propagandize
craziness
to
have
your
feelings
about
turks
tickled
the
armenians
in
armenia
and
nk
will
be
there
with
the
same
people
you
seem
to
hate
as
their
neighbors
for
maybe
years
more
the
sooner
theres
peace
in
the
region
the
better
it
is
for
them
and
everyone
else
id
push
for
compromise
if
i
were
you
instead
of
hitting
the
capslock
and
spreading
inflammatory
halftruths
