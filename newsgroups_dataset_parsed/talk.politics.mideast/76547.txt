RE
FINAL
SOLUTION
FOR
GAZA
IN
ARTICLE
CENTER
FOR
POLICY
RESEARCH
CPRIGCAPCORG
WRITES
THERE
ARE
BASICALLY
THREE
ALTERNATIVES
FOR
GAZA
WHAT
IS
THIS
GAZA
ARE
YOU
PURPOSELY
SEPARATING
IT
FROM
THE
WEST
BANK
IF
SO
WHY
SEPARATE
THE
PEOPLE
AND
TERRITORIES
IF
NOT
WHY
ARE
YOU
JUST
ADDRESSING
GAZA
HERE
TO
THROW
THE
JEWS
TO
THE
SEA
THAT
IS
BASICALLY
TO
MAKE
THEM
LEAVE
THE
MIDDLEEAST
AND
GO
BACK
TO
WHERE
THEY
CAME
FROM
RUSSIA
EUROPE
USA
ETC
BY
ALL
MEANS
CONTINUE
TO
LIST
THE
ETC
THE
REASON
I
PARTICULARLY
BRING
THIS
UP
HERE
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
MANY
FROM
MIDDLE
EASTERN
AND
WEST
ASIAN
COUNTRIES
THAT
FACT
IN
ITSELF
ADDS
AN
IMPORTANT
ELEMENT
TO
ANY
CONSIDERATION
OF
RESOLUTION
OF
THE
ARABISRAEL
CONFLICT
TO
THROW
THE
GAZANS
INTO
THE
SEA
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
YITZHAK
RABINS
WISH
AND
THAT
OF
MANY
ZIONISTS
YOU
EXPLAINED
WHAT
SEA
MEANT
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
ISRAELISJEWS
PLEASE
DO
SO
IN
THIS
CASE
FOR
ISRAELIS
AND
PALESTINIANS
TO
COME
TO
AN
HONORABLE
AND
FAIR
I
DONT
ATTEMPT
TO
SAY
JUST
SETTLEMENT
JUST
YOU
BETTER
NOT
ASK
FOR
THAT
BECAUSE
THAT
WOULD
MEAN
NORTH
AMERICAN
TRIBES
WOULD
BE
RETURNED
THEIR
LANDS
THE
PREISLAMIC
TRIBES
WOULD
TAKE
BACK
THEIR
LANDS
FROM
THE
ISLAMIC
INVADERS
THE
SAXONS
GET
TO
KICK
THE
NORMANS
OUT
OF
THE
UK
THE
CENTRAL
AND
SOUTH
AMERICAN
TRIBES
GET
TO
KICK
THE
SPANISH
DESCENDENTS
OUT
OF
THIER
LANDS
AND
ONCE
WE
HAVE
RETURNED
THE
LAND
TO
THOSE
WHO
LAST
POSSESSED
IT
WE
HAVE
TO
FIND
OUT
FROM
WHOM
THEY
STOLE
IT
AT
SOME
POINT
EVERY
CULTURE
STOLE
THE
LAND
THEY
ARE
ON
FROM
PREVIOUS
OCCUPANTS
WHICH
WOULD
ALLOW
EACH
PERSON
TO
LIVE
IN
DIGNITY
IN
HIS
COUNTRY
IN
FREEDOM
AND
EQUALITY
BUT
WAIT
NOW
YOU
REFER
TO
PALESTINIANS
SO
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
GAZA
I
PERSONNALY
OPT
FOR
THE
THIRD
ALTERNATIVE
HOW
ABOUT
YOU
FOLKS
AS
WE
BOTH
KNOW
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
CHOOSE
THE
THIRD
ALTERNATIVE
AND
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
DONE
SO
IN
THE
PAST
PERHAPS
YOU
WOULD
INITIATE
THINGS
BY
PRESENTING
YOUR
VISION
OF
RESOLUTION
IN
DOING
SO
HOWEVER
THE
WORRIES
NOT
PARANIOAS
WORRIES
AND
RESONABLE
EXPECTATIONS
OF
BOTH
PARTIES
SHOULD
BE
CONSIDERED
