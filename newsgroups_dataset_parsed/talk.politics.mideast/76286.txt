THE
ISRAELI
PRESS
ANDY
BEYER
HAS
CLAIMED
THAT
THE
ISRAELI
PRESS
IS
A
BIT
BIASED
BUT
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THERE
ARE
EVENTS
SHAPING
THE
POLITICS
OF
THE
MIDEAST
THAT
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
READ
THE
ISRAELI
PRESS
SIMPLY
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
MANY
OF
THESE
EVENTS
ARE
NOT
EVEN
MENTIONED
HERE
I
READ
THE
ISRAELI
PRESS
TO
LEARN
OF
IMPORTANT
EVENTS
ABOUT
WHICH
YOU
KNOW
NOTHING
BECAUSE
OF
YOUR
TOTAL
RELIANCE
ON
WESTERN
MEDIA
FOR
YOUR
INFORMATION
ON
ISRAEL
SINCE
I
READ
BOTH
AMERICAN
MEDIA
AND
ISRAELI
MEDIA
I
CAN
SAY
WITH
ABSOLUTE
CERTAINTY
THAT
ANYBODY
WHO
RELIESX
EXCLUSIVELY
ON
THE
AMERICAN
PRESS
FOR
KNOWLEDGE
ABOUT
ISRAEL
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
TRUE
PICTURE
OF
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
AS
TO
THE
CLAIM
THAT
ISRAELI
PAPERS
ARE
BIASED
OF
COURSE
THEY
ARE
SOME
MAY
LEAN
TO
THE
RIGHT
OR
THE
LEFT
JUST
LIKE
THE
MEDIA
HERE
IN
AMERICA
BUT
THEY
STILL
REPORT
EVENTS
ABOUT
WHICH
PEOPLE
HERE
KNOW
NOTHING
I
CHOOSE
TO
FORM
MY
OPINIONS
ABOUT
ISRAEL
AND
THE
MIDEAST
BASED
ON
MORE
KNOWLEDGE
THAN
DOES
AN
AVERAGE
AMERICAN
WHO
RELIES
EXCLUSIVELY
ON
AN
AMERICAN
MEDIA
WHICH
DOES
NOT
REPORT
ON
EVENTS
IN
THE
MIDEAST
WITH
ANY
CONSISTENCY
OR
ACCURACY
