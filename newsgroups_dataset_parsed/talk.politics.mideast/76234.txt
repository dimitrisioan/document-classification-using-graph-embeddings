RE
ISRAELS
EXPANSION
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
JUST
A
COUPLE
OF
QUESTIONS
FOR
THE
PROISRAELI
LOBBY
OUT
THERE
IS
ISRAELS
OCCUPATION
OF
SOUTHERN
LEBANON
TEMPORARY
FOR
MR
STEIN
I
AM
WORKING
ON
A
PROOF
FOR
YOU
THAT
ISRAEL
IS
DIVERTING
WATER
TO
THE
JORDAN
RIVER
AWAY
FROM
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
YES
AS
LONG
AS
THE
GOVERMENT
OVER
THERE
CAN
FORCE
SOME
AUTHORITY
AND
PREVENT
TERRORISTS
ATTACK
AGAINST
ISRAEL
IS
ISRAELS
OCCUPATION
OF
THE
WEST
BANK
GAZA
AND
GOLAN
TEMPORARY
IF
SO
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
SUPPORT
IT
WHY
WERE
SO
MANY
SETTLERS
MOVED
INTO
THE
TERRITORIES
IF
IT
IS
NOT
TEMPORARY
LETS
HEAR
IT
SINAI
HAD
SEVERAL
BIG
CITIES
THAT
WERE
AVCUATED
WHEN
ISREAL
GAVE
IT
BACK
TO
EGYPTH
BUT
FOR
A
PEACE
AGREEMENT
SO
IT
IS
MY
OPININ
THAT
THE
SETTLERS
WILL
NOT
BE
AN
OBSTACLE
FOR
WITHDRAWAL
AS
LONG
IT
IS
COMBINED
WITH
A
REAL
PEACE
AGREEMENT
WITH
THE
ARABS
AND
THE
PALASTINIANS
