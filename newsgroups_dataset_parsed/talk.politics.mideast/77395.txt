IT
LOOKS
LIKE
BEN
BAZS
MIND
AND
HEART
ARE
ALSO
BLIND
NOT
ONLY
HIS
EYES
I
USED
TO
RESPECT
HIM
TODAY
I
LOST
THE
MINIMAL
AMOUNT
OF
RESPECT
THAT
I
STRUGGLED
TO
KEEP
FOR
HIM
TO
ALL
MUSLIM
NETTERS
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
GUY
WHO
GAVE
A
FATWAH
THAT
SAUDI
ARABIA
CAN
BE
USED
BY
THE
UNITED
STSTES
TO
ATTACK
IRAQ
THEY
WERE
ATTACKING
THE
IRAQIS
TO
DRIVE
THEM
OUT
OF
KUWAIT
A
COUNTRY
WHOSE
CITIZENS
HAVE
CLOSE
BLOOD
AND
BUSINESS
TIES
TO
SAUDI
CITIZENS
AND
ME
THINKS
IF
THE
US
HAD
NOT
HELPED
OUT
THE
IRAQIS
WOULD
HAVE
SWALLOWED
SAUDI
ARABIA
TOO
OR
AT
LEAST
THE
EASTERN
OILFIELDS
AND
NO
MUSLIM
COUNTRY
WAS
DOING
MUCH
OF
ANYTHING
TO
HELP
LIBERATE
KUWAIT
AND
PROTECT
SAUDI
ARABIA
INDEED
IN
SOME
MASSES
OF
CITIZENS
WERE
DEMONSTRATING
IN
FAVOR
OF
THAT
BUTCHER
SADDAM
WHO
KILLED
LOTSA
MUSLIMS
JUST
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
KILLING
RAPING
AND
LOOTING
RELATIVELY
RICH
MUSLIMS
AND
ALSO
THUMBING
HIS
NOSE
AT
THE
WEST
THE
WHOLE
SADDAM
IS
GOING
TO
INVADE
SAUDI
ARABIA
WAS
NOTHING
BUT
US
STATE
DEPARTMENT
PROPEGANDA
SADDAM
AND
IRAQ
IN
GENERAL
NEVER
RECOGNISED
THE
BRITISH
CREATED
KUWAIT
THEY
WERE
TRYING
TO
RECOVER
LAND
THEY
BELIEVED
WAS
THEIRS
MUCH
LIKE
THE
ARGENTINES
IN
THE
FAULKLANDS
THE
KUWAITIS
PUSHED
JUST
A
LITTLE
TOO
FAR
BY
TAKING
IRAQI
OIL
AND
SADDAM
THOUGHT
HED
SETTLE
THE
DISPUTE
THE
OLD
FASHIONED
WAY
EVERYBODY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
MUCH
BETTER
OFF
HAD
THEY
LEFT
THE
REUNITED
IRAQ
TOGETHER
AND
CONCENTRATED
ON
TAKING
OUT
SADDAM
A
STRONG
UNITED
IRAQ
WITH
AN
ELECTED
GOVERNMENT
WOULD
HAVE
GONE
A
LONG
WAY
TO
RIDDING
THE
WORLD
OF
THE
FEUDAL
DICTATORSHIPS
IN
THE
GULF
BUT
OF
COURSE
A
WEAK
DIVIDED
ARAB
PEOPLE
BETTER
SUITS
US
FORIEGN
POLICY
THE
US
HAD
NO
PROBLEM
KILLING
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
ILLEQUIPTED
IRAQI
SOLDIERS
INCLUDING
BURYING
SEVERAL
THOUSAND
ALIVE
AND
SLAUGHTERING
RETREATING
BATALLIONS
FROM
THE
AIR
IN
DEFENSE
OF
KUWAITI
OIL
BUT
IT
HAS
YET
TO
LIFT
A
FINGER
AGAINST
BOSNIAN
SERBS

THEY
SLAUGHTER
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
