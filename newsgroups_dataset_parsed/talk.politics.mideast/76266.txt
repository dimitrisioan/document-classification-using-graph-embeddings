HAIR
DOWN

FALLING
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
PUSHING

OTHER

IT
FROM
THEIR
BALCONIES
TOLD
US
THEY
SEIZED
HER
BY
THE
HAIR
AND
DRAGGED
HER
A
COUPLE
OF
BLOCKS
AS
FAR
AS
THE
MORTGAGE
BANK
THATS
A
GOOD
BLOCK
AND
A
HALF
OR
TWO
FROM
HERE
I
KNOW
THIS
FOR
SURE
BECAUSE
I

BORN
TRAIN
CONDUCTOR
AZERBAIJANI

MICRODISTRICT
NO
SUMGAIT
AZERBAIJAN
I
HADNT
LIVED
VERY
LONG
IN
SUMGAIT
ONLY
EIGHT
YEARS
I
MOVED
THERE
FROM
NOVOSIBIRSK
MY
SON
ENTERED
THE
BAKU
NAUTICAL
SCHOOL
AND
SO
I
TRANSFERRED
TO
AZERBAIJAN
LATER
I
MET
SOMEONE
AND
MARRIED
HIM
AND
NOW
MY
NAME
IS
ARUTUNIAN
MY
HUSBANDS
NAME
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
A
MASSACRE
WAS
NOT
DISCUSSED
OPENLY
BUT
THERE
WERE
HINTS
AND
GIBES
SO
TO
SPEAK
AT
THE
ARMENIAN
PEOPLE
AND
THEY
WERE
MOCKING
THE
RUSSIANS
TOO
I
WAS
CONSTANTLY
AWARE
OF
IT
AT
WORK
AND
NOT
JUST
THIS
PAST
YEAR
I
COULDNT
FIND
A
DEFINITE
PLACE
FOR
MYSELF
IN
THE
POOL
AT
WORK
BECAUSE
I
ILL
JUST
SAY
IT
COULDNT
STEAL
COULDNT
DECEIVE
AND
COULDNT
BE
INVOLVED
IN
BRIBETAKING
AND
WHEN
I
ASKED
FOR
DECENT
WORKING
CONDITIONS
THEY
TOLD
ME
LEAVE
DONT
KEEP
THE
OTHERS
FROM
WORKING
YOU
ARENT
CUT
OUT
FOR
THIS
KIND
OF
WORK
AND
AT
WORK
AND
AROUND
ALL
THE
TIME
I
WOULD
HEAR
GIBES
AT
THE
ARMENIANS
LIKE
THE
TURKS
HAD
IT
RIGHT
THEY
KILLED
THEM
ALLTHE
WAY
THEYVE
MULTIPLIED
HERE
THEYRE
MAKING
IT
HARD
FOR
US
TO
LIVE
AND
THINGS
WILL
BE
JUST
FINE
IF
WE
GET
RID
OF
THEM
ALL
NO
PROBLEM
THE
TURKS
WILL
HELP
THEY
SAY
IF
WE
ASK
THEM
THEYLL
RID
ARMENIA
OF
ARMENIANS
IN
HALF
AN
HOUR
WELL
THATS
THE
WAY
IT
ALL
WAS
BUT
I
NEVER
THOUGHT
OF
COURSE
THAT
IT
WOULD
SPILL
OVER
INTO
A
BLOODY
TRAGEDY
BECAUSE
YOU
JUST
COULDNT
IMAGINE
IT
HERE
WEVE
BEEN
LIVING
UNDER
THE
SOVIET
GOVERNMENT
FOR
YEARS
AND
NO
ONE
EVEN
CONSIDERED
SUCH
AN
IDEA
POSSIBLE
BUT
I
HAD
BEEN
FORMING
MY
OWN
OPINIONS
AND
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
AUTHORITATIVE
PEOPLE
I
WOULD
OFTEN
ASK
WHERE
IS
THIS
ALL
LEADING
DO
PEOPLE
REALLY
NOT
SEE
WHAT
KIND
OF
SITUATION
IS
EMERGING
HERE
THE
RUSSIANS
ARE
FLEEING
SUMGAIT
THERE
ARE
VERY
FEW
OF
THEM
LEFT
WHY
IS
NO
ONE
DEALING
WITH
THIS
WHATS
GOING
ON
AND
WHEN
IT
ALL
HAPPENED
ON
THE
AND
IT
BECAME
CLEAR
THAT
EVERYTHING
HAD
BEEN
ARRANGED
BY
SOMEONE
BECAUSE
WHAT
ELSE
ARE
YOU
TO
MAKE
OF
IT
IF
THE
FIRST
SECRETARY
OF
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
IS
MARCHING
AHEAD
OF
THE
DEMONSTRATION
WITH
AN
AZERBAIJANI
FLAG
I
WOULDNT
BE
SAYING
THIS
NOW
IF
I
HADNT
RECEIVED
PERSONAL
CONFIRMATION
FROM
HIM
LATER
BECAUSE
WHEN
WE
WERE
UNDER
GUARD
IN
THE
SK
CLUB
ON
THE
HE
CAME
TO
THE
CLUB
THAT
MUSLIMZADE
THE
WOMEN
TOLD
ME
THERE
HE
IS
THERE
HE
IS
THATS
MUSLIMZADE
I
DIDNT
BELIEVE
THE
RUMORS
THAT
HE
HAD
CARRIED
AN
AZERBAIJANI
FLAG
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THEY
WERE
JUST
FALSE
RUMORS
I
WENT
OVER
TO
HIM
AND
SAID
ARE
YOU
THE
FIRST
SECRETARY
OF
OUR
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
HE
ANSWERS
ME
YES
AND
I
ASK
HIM
TELL
ME
DID
YOU
REALLY
MARCH
AHEAD
OF
THAT
GANG
CARRYING
AN
AZERBAIJANI
FLAG
AND
BEHIND
YOU
THEY
WERE
CARRYING
DENIGRATING
SIGNS
I
DONT
KNOW
EXACTLY
WHAT
THEY
SAID
BUT
THERE
WAS
MENTION
OF
ARMENIAN
BLOOD
AND
HE
TELLS
ME
YES
I
WAS
THERE
BUT
I
TRIED
TO
DISSUADE
THEM
FROM
IT
THEN
I
ASKED
HIM
ANOTHER
QUESTION
AND
WHERE
WERE
YOU
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BURNING
AND
SLAUGHTERING
US
AND
HE
SAID
I
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
WE
DIDNT
ANTICIPATE
THAT
THAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IN
SUMGAIT
COMRADE
MAMEDOV
THE
FIRST
DEPUTY
CHAIRMAN
OF
THE
COUNCIL
OF
MINISTERS
OF
THE
AZERBAIJANI
SSR
ANSWERED
THE
SAME
QUESTION
FOR
ME
NO
WE
ACTUALLY
DIDNT
ANTICIPATE
THE
SLAUGHTER
IN
SUMGAIT
AT
THAT
TIME
WE
WERE
TRYING
TO
CONTAIN
THE
CROWD
OF
IN
BAKU
THAT
WAS
PREPARING
FOR
A
MASSACRE
THOSE
ARE
HIS
EXACT
WORDS
THE
ONES
HE
SAID
IN
THE
OFFICE
OF
THE
COUNCIL
OF
MINISTERS
OF
THE
ARMENIAN
SSR
AND
NOW
ABOUT
THE
EVENTS
THEMSELVES
OF
COURSE
ITS
PAINFUL
TO
DISCUSS
THEM
BECAUSE
IT
MAY
SEEM
THAT
ITS
NOT
TRUE
TO
SOMEONE
ELSE
VARIOUS
RUMORS
CONCERNING
WHAT
HAPPENED
ARE
MAKING
THE
ROUNDS
SOME
ARE
TRUE
OTHERS
ARENT
BUT
UNFORTUNATELY
THERE
ARE
MORE
TRUE
ONES
THAN
FALSE
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
SO
HORRIBLE
IN
OUR
AGE
HERE
IN
THE
SPACE
AGE
THE
AGE
OF
SCIENCE
THE
AGE
OF
PROGRESS
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
SOMEONE
HAD
TOLD
ME
THIS
STORY
IF
I
WERE
LIVING
IN
OR
AROUND
MOSCOW
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
BELIEVED
IT
WHY
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
REALLY
A
GENOCIDE
IT
WAS
A
MASSACRE
THATS
GENUINELY
WHAT
IT
WAS
FOR
EXAMPLE
ON
THAT
DAY
THE
DIDNT

MY
HUSBAND

AND
AFTER

WERE
OVERTURNING
ARMENIAN
CARS
AND
BURNING
THEM
THEY
WERE
LOOKING
INTO
CARS
AND
ASKING
ARE

THEY
ANSWERED
IN
ARMENIAN
THEN
THEY
TURNED
THE
CAR
OVER
AND
BURNED

THAT
BE
AND
SHE
SAID
MUSLIMZADE
WAS
LEADING
THE
CROWD
AND
THE
SPUTNIK
STORE
WAS
COMPLETELY
SMASHED
BECAUSE
MOST
OF
THE
SALESPEOPLE
THERE
ARE
ARMENIANS
AND
WHEN
HE
SAW
THAT
THEY
HAD
STARTED
BREAKING
THE
GLASS
IN
THAT
STORE
HE
SAID
DONT
BREAK
THE
SHOP
WINDOWS
DONT
DESTROY
STATE
PROPERTY
BUT
DO
WHATEVER
ELSE
YOU
WANT
I
DIDNT
HEAR
THIS
WITH
MY
OWN
TWO
EARS
BUT
IT
IS
A
FACT
THAT
THE
STORE
WAS
TORN
UP
AND
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
THE
STORE
WAS
BEATEN
FOR
EMPLOYING
ARMENIANS
ALTHOUGH
HES
AN
AZERBAIJANI
WHILE
WE
WERE
TALKING
ALL
OF
A
SUDDEN
RIGHT
ACROSS
FROM
US
SEVASTYANOVA
IS
THE
FIRST
TO
LOOK
OUT
THE
WINDOW
AND
SAY
LOOK
THERES
A
CROWD
OUT
THERE
AND
SURE
ENOUGH
WHEN
WE
LOOKED
OUT
THERE
WE
SAW
THAT
THE
CROWD
HAD
ALREADY
STARTED
WRECKING
THE
NEIGHBORING
BUILDING
THERE
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
FAMILY
THERE
A
WOMAN
AND
TWO
GIRLS
THEY
LIVED
ACROSS
FROM
US
IM
SORRY
I
DONT

THE
BUILDING
NUMBER
OR
THE
PEOPLES
NAMES
SINCE
WE
WERE
IN
MY
HUSBANDS
APARTMENT
IN
MICRODISTRICT
AND
I
LIVED
IN
MICRODISTRICT
NO
THERE
WAS
AWFUL
LOOTING
GOING
ON
THERE
AT
THE
TIME
THE
MOST
HIDEOUS
THINGS
WERE
GOING
ON
THERE
THEN
ONE
BUILDING
THERE
OURS
WAS
ATTACKED
TWICE
ONCE
WASNT
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
THEY
RETURNED
TO
THE
PLACES
WHERE
THEY
HADNT
FINISHED
THE
ARMENIANS
OFF
IF
AN
AZERBAIJANI
FAMILY
DARED
TO
CONCEAL
ARMENIANS
THEY
BEAT
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
TOO
THEY
ALSO
BEAT
RUSSIANS
IF
IT
WAS
RUSSIANS
DOING
THE
HIDING
BECAUSE
THERE
WERE
RUSSIANS
AMONG
THEM
THEY
SAID
SO
ON
TELEVISION
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
OF
VARIOUS
NATIONALITIES
BUT
THEY
DIDNT
TELL
US
WHY
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
OF
DIFFERENT
NATIONALITIES
BECAUSE
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
TOUCHED
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
IF
THEY
HADNT
DARED
TO
STICK
UP
FOR
THE
ARMENIANS
AND
GIVE
THEM
TEMPORARY
SHELTER
IN
THEIR
HOMES
AT
THE
TIME
I
SAW
THIS
FROM
THE
WINDOW
I
WAS
THERE
SEVASTYANOVA
WAS
THERE
AND
SO
WAS
MY
HUSBAND
WE
WENT
OUT
ONTO
THE
BALCONY
AND
SAW
A
TELEVISION
FLY
OFF
A
BALCONY
ALL
KINDS
OF
THINGS
EVEN
A
SOFA
THEN
WHEN
IT
WAS
ALL
DOWN
THERE
THEY
BURNED
IT
UP
THEN
WE
SAW
THE
CROWD
AND
THEY
WERE
ALL
OOHING
AT
FIRST
I
COULDNT
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
AND
LATER
I
TOLD
MY
HUSBAND
LENDRUSH
L
THINK
THEYRE
BEATING
SOMEONE
OUT
THERE
AND
HE
ANSWERED
I
DONT
KNOW
COULD
BE
SUDDENLY
THE
CROWD
SEPARATED
FOR
A
MOMENT
AND
I
SAW
IT
AND
RAISA
SEVASTYANOVA
SAW
IT
TOO
MY
HUSBAND
HAD
TURNED
THE
OTHER
WAY
HE
DIDNT
SEE
IT
I
SAW
A
NAKED
GIRL
WITH
HER
HAIR
DOWN
THEY
WERE
DRAGGING
HER
SHE
KEPT
FALLING
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
PUSHING
HER
AND
KICKING
HER
SHE
FELL
DOWN
IT
WAS
MUDDY
THERE
AND
LATER
OTHER
WITNESSES
WHO
SAW
IT
FROM
THEIR
BALCONIES
TOLD
US
THEY
SEIZED
HER
BY
THE
HAIR
AND
DRAGGED
HER
A
COUPLE
OF
BLOCKS
AS
FAR
AS
THE
MORTGAGE
BANK
THATS
A
GOOD
BLOCK
AND
A
HALF
OR
TWO
FROM
HERE
I
KNOW
THIS
FOR
SURE
BECAUSE
I
SAW
IT
MYSELF
THEN
THE
CROWD
RUSHED
TOWARD
OUR
BUILDING
WE
WERE
STANDING
THERE
AND
YOU
CAN
OF
COURSE
IMAGINE
WHAT
WE
WERE
FEELING
WERE
THEY
GOING
TO
KILL
US
OR
NOT
AND
I
ALSO
HAD
THE
AWFUL
THOUGHT
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
TORMENT
ME
THE
WAY
THEY
TORMENTED
THAT
WOMAN
BECAUSE
I
HAD
JUST
SEEN
THAT
I
ASKED
MY
HUSBAND
I
GAVE
HIM
AN
AXE
AND
SAID
YOU
KILL
ME
FIRST
AND
THEN
LET
THEM
DO
WHAT
THEY
WANT
WITH
THE
CORPSE
BUT
OUR
NEIGHBORS
ITS
TRUE
DEFENDED
US
THEY
SAID
THERE
ARENT
ANY
ARMENIANS
IN
OUR
ENTRYWAY
GO
AWAY
ONLY
MUSLIMS
LIVE
HERE
DISASTER
MISSED
US
THAT
TIME
BUT
AT
TWO
OCLOCK
IN
THE
MORNING
A
CROWD
OF
ABOUT
PEOPLE
APPROXIMATELY
CAME
BACK
TO
OUR
PLACE
MY
HUSBAND
WAS
ALREADY
ASLEEP
HE
CAN
SLEEP
WHEN
HES
UPSET
ABOUT
SOMETHING
BUT
I
CANT
I
WAS
STANDING
RUNNING
FROM
BALCONY
TO
BALCONY
OUR
POWER
WAS
OUT
I
DONT
REMEMBER
FOR
HOW
LONG
BUT
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
IT
HAD
BEEN
DELIBERATELY
TURNED
OFF
THERE
WERE
NO
LIGHTS
WHATSOEVER
AND
I
WAS
GLAD
OF
COURSE
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
BETTER
THAT
WAY
BUT
THEN
I
LOOK
AND
THE
CROWD
IS
AT
OUR
BALCONY
THIS
WAS
AT
IN
THE
MORNING
THE
FIRST
TIME
THEY
WERE
AT
OUR
BUILDING
IT
WAS
AND
NOW
IT
WAS
IN
THE
MORNING
BUT
I
NEVER
THOUGHT
THAT
THAT
OLD
WOMAN
ON
THE
FIRST
FLOOR
THE
AZERBAIJANI
WAS
AWAKE
AND
WATCHING
OUT
THERE
WERE
HUMAN
BEINGS
AMONG
THEM
TOO
SO
SHE
GOES
OUT
WITH
A
PAIL
OF
GARBAGE
AS
THOUGH
SHE
NEEDED
TO
BE
TAKING
GARBAGE
OUT
AT
TWO
OCLOCK
IN
THE
MORNING
SHE
USED
IT
AS
A
PRETEXT
AND
WENT
TOWARD
THOSE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
THEY
REALLY
WERE
YOUNGSTERS
FROM
MY
BALCONY
YOU
COULD
SEE
PERFECTLY
THAT
THEY
WERE
YOUNG
AZERBAIJANI
BOYS
THEY
SPOKE
AZERBAIJANI
AND
WHEN
THEY
CAME
UP
TO
HER
SHE
SAID
WHAT
DO
YOU
WANT
AND
THEY
ANSWERED
WE
WANT
THE
ARMENIAN
FAMILY
THAT
LIVES
HERE
POINTING
TOWARD
THE
SECOND
FLOOR
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
SHE
SAYS
I
ALREADY
TOLD
YOU
WE
DONT
HAVE
ANY
ARMENIANS
HERE
NOW
LEAVE
DO
YOU
HEAR
THIS
IS
AN
OLD
MUSLIM
WOMAN
TALKING
TO
YOU
AND
GRABBED
THE
HAND
OF
ONE
BOY
WHO
WAS
TRYING
TO
WALK
AROUND
HER
AND
ENTER
THE
BUILDING
ANYWAY
AND
STARTED
PUSHING
HIM
AWAY
AND
SO
THEY
SEEMED
TO
LISTEN
TO
HER
THEY
WERE
ALL
VERY
YOUNG
THEY
STARTED
APOLOGIZING
AND
LEFT
THAT
WAS
THE
SECOND
TIME
DEATH
WAS
AT
OUR
DOOR
I
FORGOT
TO
MENTION
ABOUT
ONE
OTHER
APARTMENT
A
MAN
NAMED
RUBIK
LIVES
THERE
I
DONT
KNOW
HIM
REALLY
I
KNEW
HIS
DAUGHTER
I
MEAN
I
SAW
HER
AROUND
BUT
WE
REALLY
DIDNT
KNOW
THEM
BUT
I
DO
KNOW
THAT
THAT
GUY
WHO
LIVES
ON
THE
FOURTH
FLOOR
ACROSS
FROM
OUR
ENTRYWAY
WENT
TO
CHERNOBYL
AND
WORKED
THERE
FOR
EIGHT
MONTHS
TO
EARN
MONEY
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
WHAT
THAT
MEANS
HE
RISKED
HIS
LIFE
TO
EARN
X
AMOUNT
OF
MONEY
IN
ORDER
TO
BETTER
HIS
FAMILY
HE
BOUGHT
NEW
FURNITURE
AND
WAS
GETTING
READY
TO
GIVE
HIS
DAUGHTERS
HAND
IN
MARRIAGE
BUT
ALAS
EVERYTHING
WAS
RUINED
BY
THOSE
CREEPS
AND
SCOUNDRELS
THEY
THREW
EVERYTHING
OUT
THE
WINDOWS
AND
THE
REST
WE
SAW
FROM
OUR
BALCONY
HOW
THE
NEIGHBORS
ON
THE
LEFT
AND
RIGHT
RAN
INTO
THE
APARTMENT
AND
CARRIED
OFF
EVERYTHING
THAT
HADNT
ALREADY
BEEN
SMASHED
OR
TAKEN
WHAT
IS
ONE
TO
THINK
OF
THAT
IT
MEANS
THAT
THE
PARENTS
IN
THOSE
FAMILIES
WERE
IN
ON
IT
TOO
UNFORTUNATELY
I
CAME
TO
BE
OF
THE
OPINION
THAT
IT
WAS
ALL
ORGANIZED
AND
THAT
EVERYTHING
HAD
BEEN
FORESEEN
IN
ADVANCE
BOTH
THE
BEATING
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
AND
THE
STRIPPING
OF
APARTMENTS
SOMETHING
ON
THE
ORDER
OF
WELL
MOVE
THE
ARMENIANS
OUT
AND
TAKE
OVER
THEIR
APARTMENTS
I
HAVE
WORKED
HONESTLY
MY
WHOLE
LIFE
YOU
CAN
CHECK
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
ME
I
CAME
AS
A
PATRIOT
FROM
CHINA
WAITED
FOR
NIGHTS
ON
END
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
CONSULATE
GENERAL
OF
THE
USSR
I
CAME
TO
MY
HOMELAND
AS
A
PATRIOT
BECAUSE
I
KNEW
THAT
THE
PARTY
AND
THE
KOMSOMOL
WERE
HOLY
THINGS
BUT
WHEN
I
SAW
IN
SUMGAIT
THAT
THERE
WASNT
ANYTHING
HOLY
ABOUT
THEM
THAT
PARTY
MEMBERSHIP
WAS
BOUGHT
THAT
KOMSOMOL
MEMBERS
JOINED
ONLY
FOR
PERSONAL
GAIN
THAT
THERE
WERE
NO
IDEALS
NO
IDEAS
GOD
SAVE
ME
EVERYTHING
WAS
BEING
BOUGHT
AND
SOLD
I
SAW
ALL
OF
IT
AND
UNDERSTOOD
HOW
THEY
COULD
ALLOW
THAT
CRAP
TO
GO
ON
LIKE
IT
DID
I
CANT
TALK
ANY
MORE
ABOUT
IT
THE
IMAGE
OF
THAT
BEATING
WHEN
I
WENT
OUT
OF
MY
OWN
APARTMENTTHEY
PICKED
US
UP
UNDER
SOVIET
ARMY
GUARD
THEY
HAD
ARRIVED
FROM
ALL
OVER
TO
SUPPRESS
THAT
GANGNOT
ONLY
ARMENIANS
BUT
SOME
RUSSIAN
FAMILIES
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
TOO
CAME
OUT
OF
THEIR
APARTMENTS
AND
JOINED
US
BECAUSE
NO
NORMAL
PERSON
WHO
HAD
SEEN
THAT
COULD
STAY
THERE
WITH
THE
SITUATION
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
AND
WHATS
INTERESTING
IS
THAT
WHEN
WE
LEFT
ON
THE
BUSES
I
RODE
AND
THOUGHT
THAT
AT
LEAST
ONE
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
FOR
SURE
PEOPLE
WOULD
BASICALLY
RISE
TO
THE
SITUATION
WOULD
HAVE
SOME
COMPASSION
FOR
THE
ARMENIANS
WOULD
SOMEHOW
UNDERSTAND
THE
INJUSTICE
OF
WHAT
WAS
DONE
BUT
HAVING
ANALYZED
AND
WEIGHED
THE
WHOLE
THING
ONCE
I
CALMED
DOWN
HAVING
THOUGHT
IT
ALL
THROUGH
I
CAME
TO
A
CONCLUSION
THAT
IS
SHARED
BY
MANY
PEOPLE
IF
A
LOT
OF
AZERBAIJANIS
DIDNT
WANT
THEIR
ARMENIAN
NEIGHBORS
TO
BE
KILLED
AND
THAT
BASICALLY
DEPENDED
ON
THAT
MUSLIMZADEHE
SAID
THAT
HE
HAD
WANTED
TO
CALM
THEM
DOWNTHEN
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
HE
DIDNT
HAVE
PEOPLE
AT
HAND
TO
WHOM
HE
COULD
WHISPER
AT
THE
LAST
MINUTE
GO
AND
ANNOUNCE
IT
ON
TELEVISION
CITIZENS
OF
SUMGAIT
TAKE
WHAT
YOU
CAN
INTO
YOUR
HANDS
LETS
PROTECT
OUR
NEIGHBORS
FROM
THIS
MASSACRE
THOSE
CROWDS
WERENT
SUCH
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
CONTROLLING
THEM
BASICALLY
THEY
WERE
UNARMED
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
FIREARMS
MOSTLY
THEY
HAD
KNIVES
THEY
HAD
ALL
KINDS
OF
METAL
PARTS
LIKE
ARMATURE
SHAFTS
SHARPENED
AT
THE
ENDS
SPECIAL
ROCKS
DIFFERENT
TO
A
DEGREE
THAT
WE
NOTICED
THEM
THERE
ARENT
ROCKS
LIKE
THOSE
IN
SUMGAIT
SOILS
THEY
WERE
BROUGHT
FROM
SOMEWHERE
AS
THOUGH
IT
WERE
ALL
SPECIALLY
PLANNED
SO
AS
I
WAS
SAYING
I
WEIGHED
IT
ALL
OUT
AND
IF
ANY
OF
OUR
NEIGHBORS
HAD
WANTED
TO
DEFEND
US
WHY
WASNT
IT
ARRANGED
IT
MEANS
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
DIDNT
WANT
TO
DO
IT
WHEN
THE
CROWD
WAS
MOVING
FROM
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
TO
THE
SPUTNIK
WHAT
THERE
WAS
NO
WAY
OF
INFORMING
BAKU
NO
THERE
WAS
NO
WAY
IT
TURNS
OUT
THE
CROWD
WAS
DOING
VIOLENCE
IN
OUR
MICRODISTRICT
I
WONT
MENTION
THE
THINGS
I
DIDNT
SEE
MYSELF
ILL
ONLY
TALK
ABOUT
THE
THINGS
I
MYSELF
WITNESSED
THEY
WERE
IN
MICRODISTRICT
BEGINNING
AT
OCLOCK
IN
THE
EVENING
WHEN
I
SAW
THEM
FROM
THE
OTHER
BUILDING
AND
THEY
WERE
SOMEWHERE
ELSE
UNTIL
MIDNIGHT
OR
ONE
OCLOCK
IN
THE
MORNING
BECAUSE
AT
THEY
CAME
BACK
TO
OUR
BUILDING
THEY
HADNT
COMPLETELY
FINISHED
MAKING
THEIR
PREDATORY
ROUNDS
OF
MICRODISTRICT
WHEN
THEY
RETURNED
TO
OUR
BUILDING
I
TOLD
MY
HUSBAND
LENDRUSH
NOW
THE
POLICE
ARE
PROBABLY
GOING
TO
COME
MY
GOD
NOW
THE
AUTHORITIES
ARE
PROBABLY
GOING
TO
FIND
OUT
AND
COME
TO
OUR
AID
WELL
ALAS
NO
THERE
WERE
TO
BE
NO
AUTHORITIES
NOT
A
SINGLE
POLICEMAN
NOT
A
SINGLE
FIREMAN
NOT
A
SINGLE
AMBULANCE
CAME
WHILE
THEY
WERE
RAGING
AS
IT
TURNS
OUT
AS
WE
LATER
FOUND
OUT
BEGINNING
ON
THE
MIGHT
OF
THE
THERE
WERE
DEAD
PEOPLE
RUINED
APARTMENTS
AND
BURNED
AUTOS
ONE
CAR
NEAR
THE
BUS
STATION
IT
WAS
BURNED
AND
OVERTURNED
IT
WAS
PROBABLY
THERE
ABOUT
FOUR
DAYS
EVERYONE
SAW
IT
AND
WHAT
WENT
ON
IN
BLOCK
THOSE
WHO
LIVE
THERE
KNOW
THEY
SAW
FROM
THEIR
BALCONIES
HOW
THEY
ATTACKED
THE
SOLDIERS
IN
THE
BUSES
HOW
THEY
BEAT
THOSE
POOR
UNARMED
SOLDIERS
AND
HOW
ON
THAT
SQUARE
I
CANT
REMEMBER
THE
NAME
OF
IT
WHERE
THERE
IS
THAT
FORK
COMING
FROM
THE
BUS
STATION
THAT
INTERSECTION
NOW
IM
UPSET
AND
I
CANT
THINK
OF
THE
NAME
THERES
A
TALL
BUILDING
THERE
A
AND
FROM
THE
BALCONIES
THERE
PEOPLE
SAW
THAT
BUTCHERY
WHEN
THE
POOR
SOLDIERS
WEARING
ONLY
HELMETS
WITH
SHIELDS
AND
THOSE
UNFORTUNATE
CLUBS
MOVED
AGAINST
THAT
MOB
AND
WHEN
THEY
FELL
THOSE
BOYS
RAN
UP
AND
USING
STONES
BIG
HEAVY
STONES
BEAT
THEM
TO
DEATH
ON
THEIR
HEADS
WHO
COULD
HAVE
GUESSED
THAT
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
COULD
HAPPEN
IN
THE
SOVIET
UNION
AND
UNDER
THE
SOVIET
GOVERNMENT
THE
UPSHOT
IS
THAT
THIS
REPUBLIC
HAS
NOT
BEEN
UNDER
SOVIET
CONTROL
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
BUT
NO
ONE
WANTED
TO
PAY
ANY
ATTENTION
OR
GET
INVOLVED
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
GO
AND
ASK
AT
MY
WORK
MANY
PEOPLE
WOULD
CONFIRM
THAT
I
TELL
THE
TRUTH
IVE
BEEN
STRUGGLING
FOR
TRUTH
FOR
FIVE
YEARS
THERE
ALREADY
THE
FIVE
YEARS
THAT
I
WORKED
AT
THE
AZERBAIJANI
RAILROAD
SOME
PEOPLE
THERE
CONSIDERED
ME
A
DEMAGOGUE
OTHERS
WHO
KNOWS
WHAT
SOME
THINK
IM
AN
ADVENTURE
SEEKER
AND
SOME
A
PRANKSTER
BUT
I
WANTED
EVERYTHING
TO
BE
RIGHT
I
WOULD
BECOME
OUTRAGED
HOW
CAN
THIS
BE
WHY
IS
IT
PEOPLE
TREAT
ONE
ANOTHER
THIS
WAY
ON
A
SOVIET
RAILROAD
AS
THOUGH
THE
AZERBAIJANI
RAILROAD
WERE
AZERBAIJANI
PROPERTY
OR
THE
PROPERTY
OF
SOME
MAGNATE
OR
SOME
MAFIA
IF
I
WANT
TO
ILL
GET
YOU
OUT
OF
HERE
IF
I
WANT
TO
ILL
GET
RID
OF
YOU
IF
I
WANT
TO
ILL
DO
SOMETHING
ELSE
AND
THERES
A
BLACK
MARKET
PRICE
FOR
EVERYTHING
IN
THE
MOST
BRAZEN
WAY
A
COACH
TO
MOSCOW
COSTS
SO
MUCH
A
COACH
ON
A
LOCAL
TRAIN
COSTS
SO
MUCH
ONCE
WHEN
I
WAS
COMPLAINING
TO
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
CONDUCTORS
POOL
HE
HAD
THE
NERVE
TO
TELL
ME
MAYBE
YOU
WONT
EVEN
BELIEVE
THIS
BUT
THIS
IM
AFRAID
I
HEARD
WITH
MY
OWN
EARS
TATYANA
JUST
HOW
LONG
CAN
YOU
FIGHT
FOR
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
KNOW
WILL
NEVER
HAVE
ANY
EFFECT
YOURE
ALONE
AGAINST
EVERYONE
SO
INSTEAD
WHY
DONT
YOU
GIVE
MORE
MONEY
TO
THE
CHIEF
CONDUCTOR
AND
EVERYTHING
WILL
GO
FINE
FOR
YOU
I
STARTED
TO
CRY
TURNED
AND
LEFT
WHAT
ELSE
COULD
I
DO
WHERE
ELSE
COULD
I
GO
TO
COMPLAIN
I
REALIZED
THAT
EVERYTHING
WAS
USELESS
AND
THE
ROOT
OF
THE
WHOLE
THING
IS
THAT
IT
ALL
GOES
ON
AND
NO
ONE
WANTS
TO
SEE
IT
I
FILED
A
WRITTEN
COMPLAINT
AND
THEY
GROUND
IT
INTO
DUST
THEY
DESTROYED
IT
I
STILL
HAVE
A
COPY
BUT
WHATS
THE
USE
WHEN
THE
GENERAL
PROCURACY
GOT
INVOLVED
WITH
THE
INVESTIGATION
OF
THE
BLOODY
SUMGAIT
AFFAIR
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
INFORMATION
ABOUT
WHAT
I
SAW
WHAT
I
WAS
A
WITNESS
TO
I
GAVE
TESTIMONY
ABOUT
THE
MAFIA
AT
THE
RAILROAD
THEY
ACCEPTED
MY
PETITION
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THEYRE
GOING
TO
PURSUE
IT
OR
NOT
BECAUSE
YOULL
EXCUSE
ME
I
NO
LONGER
BELIEVE
IN
THE
THINGS
I
ASPIRED
TO
THE
THINGS
I
BELIEVED
IN
BEFORE
ITS
ALL
DEAD
THEY
JUST
SPIT
ON
MY
SOUL
STOMPED
ON
EVERYTHING
PHYSICALLY
AND
MOST
IMPORTANT
SPIRITUALLY
BECAUSE
YOU
CAN
LOSE
BELONGINGS
THATS
NONSENSE
THAT
ALL
COMES
WITH
TIME
BUT
WHEN
YOUR
SOUL
IS
SPIT
UPON
AND
WHEN
THE
BEST
IN
YOUYOUR
BELIEFSARE
DESTROYED
IT
CAN
BE
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
RESTORE
THEM
I
WANT
TO
TELL
OF
ONE
INCIDENT
I
JUST
DONT
KNOW
AT
THE
TIME
I
WAS
IN
SUCH
A
STATE
THAT
I
DIDNT
EVEN
TAKE
MINOR
THINGS
INTO
ACCOUNT
HERE
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
COURSE
ITS
NOT
A
MINOR
ONE
MY
NEIGHBOR
RAISA
SEVASTYANOVA
SHE
HAS
A
SON
VALERY
WHO
IS
IN
THE
GRADE
IN
A
SCHOOL
IN
MICRODISTRICT
A
BOY
VITALY
DANIELIAN
I
DONT
KNOW
HIS
LAST
NAME
GOES
TO
SCHOOL
WITH
HIM
OR
RATHER
WENT
TO
SCHOOL
WITH
HIM
I
WAS
JUST
SITTING
IN
AN
APARTMENT
TRYING
TO
MAKE
A
PHONE
CALL
TO
MOSCOW
OH
YES
AND
THERES
ONE
IMPORTANT
DETAIL
WHEN
THE
MASSACRE
BEGAN
FOR
TWO
TO
THREE
HOURS
THE
PHONES
WERENT
WORKING
IN
ARMENIAN
APARTMENTS
AND
LATER
IN
SEVERAL
RUSSIAN
AND
AZERBAIJANI
APARTMENTS
BUT
THE
FACT
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
THAT
SERVICE
WAS
SHUT
OFF
YOU
COULD
NOT
CALL
ANYWHERE
WHY
AGAIN
IT
MEANS
IT
WAS
ALL
PLANNED
HOW
COME
SERVICE
IS
CUT
OFF
FOR
NO
REASON
AND
THE
LIGHTS
WENT
OFF
AND
THOSE
BRATS
WERE
RAGING
AS
THEY
LIKED
THEY
WERENT
AFRAID
THEY
RAN
ABOUT
FREELY
THEY
THAT
NO
ONE
WOULD
SLAP
THEIR
HANDS
AND
NO
ONE
WOULD
DARE
TO
STOP
THEM
THEY
KNEW
IT
NOW
IM
GOING
TO
TELL
ABOUT
THE
INCIDENT
SO
THIS
LITTLE
VITALY
VITALIK
AN
ARMENIAN
BOY
WENT
TO
SCHOOL
WITH
VALERY
THEY
WERE
IN
THE
SAME
CLASS
ACCORDING
TO
WHAT
VALERY
AND
HIS
NEIGHBOR
PAL
SAIDAT
THE
TIME
I
WAS
IN
THE
SAME
APARTMENT
AS
THEY
WERE
I
SAT
AT
THE
PHONE
WAITING
FOR
THE
CALL
TO
BE
PUT
THROUGHA
MOB
ATTACKED
THE
BUILDING
WHERE
VITALIK
LIVED
SO
VALERY
RAN
TO
HIS
MOTHER
AND
SAID
MAMMA

LET
ME
GO
TO
VITALIKS
WHAT
IF
THEY
KILL
HIM
MAYBE
HES

ALIVE
MAYBE
WE

BRING
HIM
HERE
AND
SAVE
HIM
SOMEHOW
HES
A
NICE
GUY
WE
ALL
LIKE
HIM
HES
A
GOOD
PERSON
HES
SMART
HIS
MOTHER
WOULDNT
LET
HIM
GO
IN
TEARS
SHE
SAYS
VALERY
YOU
CANT
GO
BECAUSE
I
AM
AFRAID
HE
SAYS
MAMMA
WE
CAN
GET
AROUND
THE
CROWD
WELL
JUST
WATCH
JUST
HAVE
A
LOOK
THEY
MADE
IT
THROUGH
I
DONT
KNOW
I
THINK
VITALIKS
PARENTS
LIVED
IN
MICRODISTRICT
NO
AND
WHEN
THEY
GOT
THERE
THEY
MADE
A
SUPERFICIAL
DEDUCTION
KNOWING
THAT
BALCONIES
AND
DOORS
WERE
BEING
BROKEN
EVERYWHERE
THAT
YOU
COULD
SEE
FROM
THE
STREET
WHICH
WERE
THE
ARMENIAN
APARTMENTS
IN
THE
BUILDING
THEY
WENT
HERE
AND
THERE
AND
LOOKED
AND
SAW
THAT
THE
WINDOWS
WERE
INTACT
AND
SO
THEY
CALMED
DOWN
BUT
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
WINDOWS
IN
THAT
APARTMENT
WERE
NOT
BROKEN
EVERYTHING
INSIDE
WAS
TOTALLY
SMASHED
AND
VITALIK
LAY
THERE
WITH
A
BROKEN
SKULL
AND
HIS
MOTHER
AND
FATHER
HAD
ALREADY
BEEN
MURDERED
LITTLE
VITALIK
DIDNT
EVEN
KNOW
THEY
WERE
DEAD
SO
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
DONT
KNOW
HE
WAS
IN
CRITICAL
CONDITION
NO
MAYBE
IT
WAS
LONGER
WE
LEFT
SUMGAIT
ON
MARCH
SPENT
SOME
TIME
IN
MOSCOW
AND
THEN
WE
CAME
TO
YEREVAN
SO
ITS
BEEN
ABOUT
A
MONTH
ALREADY
ITS
SO
HARD
TO
KEEP
ALL
THIS
STRAIGHT
SO
VALERY
THE
NEXT
DAY
WHEN
HE
FOUND
OUT
THAT
VITALIKS
FAMILY
HAS
BEEN
KILLED
AND
VITALIK
WAS
LING
IN
THE
SEMASHKO
HOSPITAL
IN
BAKU
VALERY
AND
HIS
CLASSMATES
GOT
TOGETHER
AND
WENT
TO
VISIT
HIM
BUT
THEY
WOULDNT
ADMIT
THEM
TELLING
THEM
THAT
HE
WAS
IN
CRITICAL
CONDITION
AND
THAT
HE
WAS
STILL
IN
A
COMA
THEY
CRIED
AND
LEFT
HAVING
ALSO
FOUND
OUT
THAT
THE
GIRL
I
SAW
BEING
KICKED
AND
DRAGGED
WAS
IN
THAT
HOSPITAL
TOO
AS
IT
TURNS
OUT
SHE
WAS
BROUGHT
THERE
IN
SERIOUS
CONDITION
BUT
AT
LEAST
SHE
WAS
ALIVE
AT
THE
TIME
WHEN
WE
GOT
TO
THE
SK
CLUB
WE
WOULD
SEE
FIRST
ONE
FRIEND
AND
THEN
ANOTHER
THROW
OURSELVES
INTO
THEIR
ARMS
AND
KISS
THEM
BECAUSE
YOU
HAD
WONDERED
IF
THESE
FRIENDS
WERE
ALIVE
OR
NOT
IF
THOSE
FRIENDS
WERE
ALIVE
OR
NOT
AND
WHEN
YOU
SAW
THEM
YOU
WERE
SO
GLAD
TO
FIND
OUT
THAT
THE
FAMILY
HAD
LIVED
WHEN
YOU
SAW
PEOPLE
YOU
HEARD
THINGS
THAT
MADE
YOUR
HAIR
STAND
ON
END
IF
YOU
PUBLISH
EVERYTHING
THAT
HAPPENED
IT
WILL
BE
A
HIDEOUS
BOOK
A
BOOK
OF
THINGS
IT
IS
EVEN
DIFFICULT
TO
BELIEVE
AND
THOSE
TWO
GIRLS
WHO
WERE
RAPED
WERE
ENTIRELY
BLACK
AND
BLUE
THE
ONES
AT
THE
SK
THEY
KNOW
IM
NOT
LYING
THAT
GIRLFRIEND
CAME
UP
TO
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
SAID
WHAT
HAPPENED
AND
SHE
BARED
HER
BREASTS
AND
THEY
WERE
COMPLETELY
COVERED
IN
CIGARETTE
BURNS
THOSE
ROGUES
HAD
PUT
CIGARETTES
OUT
ON
HER
BREASTS
AFTER
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
YOU
CAN
LIVE
IN
A
CITY
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
PEOPLE
IN
IT
NOW
WHEN
WE
STAYED
AT
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
FOR
A
WHILE
THEY
PROVIDED
WELL
BASIC
CONDITIONS
FOR
US
THERE
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
IS
LOCATED
IN
NASOSNY
SOME
SIX
MILES
FROM
SUMGAIT
AND
LIVING
THERE
WE
MET
WITH
A
LARGER
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
PEOPLE
AT
THE
UNIT
YOU
KNOW
THERE
WAS
A
POINT
WHEN
I
COULDNT
EVEN
GO
OUTSIDE
BECAUSE
IF
YOU
WENT
OUTSIDE
YOU
SAW
SO
MUCH
HEARTBREAK
AROUND
YOU
AND
WHEN
YOU
HEAR
THE
FALSE
RUMORS
YES
BY
THE
WAY
FALSE
RUMORS
WERE
SPREAD
IN
SUMGAIT
SAYING
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
AROUND
YEREVAN
HAD
DESTROYED
AZERBAIJANI
VILLAGES
AND
RAZED
THEM
TO
THE
GROUND
WITH
BULLDOZERS
I
DIDNT
KNOW
WHETHER
TO
BELIEVE
IT
OR
NOT
AND
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
KNOW
ANY
BETTER
GET
THE
IDEA
THAT
IT
WAS
ALL
DONE
IN
REVENGE
BUT
WHEN
I
ARRIVED
IN
ARMENIA
AND
WAS
IN
SPITAK
AND
IN
SPITAK
ALL
THOSE
VILLAGES
ARE
NOT
ONLY
INTACT
BUT
AT
THAT
TIME
HAD
EVEN
BEEN
PROTECTED
JUST
IN
CASE
THEY
WERE
GUARDED
THEY
GOT
BETTER
FOOD
THAN
DID
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
SPITAK
NOT
A
SINGLE
PERSON
THERE
DIED
AND
NO
ONE
IS
PLANNING
TO
HARM
THEM
AROUND
YEREVAN
ALL
THE
VILLAGES
ARE
SAFE
AND
UNHARMED
AND
THE
ARMENIANS
DIDNT
ATTACK
ANYONE
BUT
ACTUALLY
AFTER
AN
EVIL
OF
THE
MAGNITUDE
SUFFERED
IN
SUMGAIT
THERE
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
FEELING
OF
VENGEFULNESS
BUT
NO
ONE
ACTED
ON
IT
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
YOU
SOMETIMES
HEAR
ACCUSATIONS
TO
THE
EFFECT
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
GUILTY
THAT
IT
IS
THEY
WHO
ORGANIZED
IT
RUMORS
LIKE
THAT
ARE
BEING
SPREAD
IN
AZERBAIJAN
AND
IF
ONE
OLD
PERSON
SAYS
IT
AND
TEN
YOUNG
ONES
HEAR
IT
THEY
NOT
ONLY
PERCEIVE
IT
WITH
THEIR
MINDS
BUT
WITH
THEIR
HEARTS
TOO
TO
THEM
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
OLDER
PERSON
IS
TELLING
THE
TRUTH
FOR
EXAMPLE
ONE
SAYS
DID
YOU
KNOW
THAT
OUT
OF
PEOPLE
KILLED
BY
THE
WAY
ORIGINALLY
THEY
SAID
PEOPLE
BUT
LATER
THEY
FOUND
A
WERE
AZERBAIJANI
AND
ONE
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
OF
COURSE
IM
UPSET
BUT
ITS
UTTERLY
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
DISCUSS
SUCH
THINGS
AND
NOT
BECOME
UPSET
SOMETIMES
L
FORGET
THINGS
BUT
I
KNOW
I
WANT
TO
RETURN
TO
THE
TIME
WHEN
WE
WERE
IN
THE
SK
CLUB
ACROSS
FROM
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
WHEN
I
SAW
MUSLIMZADE
IN
THE
SK
CLUB
BUILDING
I
WENT
TO
HIM
TO
ASK
BECAUSE
I
COULDNT
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
HAD
MARCHED
IN
THE
FRONT
CARRYING
A
BANNER
I
ALREADY
MENTIONED
THIS
AND
IF
I
REPEAT
ANYTHING
PLEASE
EXCUSE
ME
I
ASKED
HIM
WHY
DID
YOU
DO
THAT
AND
WHY
ARE
YOU
HERE
NOW
WHY
DID
YOU
COME
HERE
TO
LAUGH
AT
THESE
WOMEN
WHO
ARE
STREWN
ABOUT
ON
THE
FLOOR
THE
OVERCROWDING
THERE
WAS
TREMENDOUS
IT
WAS
COMPLETELY
UNSANITARY
AND
SEVERAL
OF
THE
CHILDREN
WERE
ALREADY
SICK
ITS
TRUE
THE
TROOPS
TRIED
TO
MAKE
IT
LIVABLE
FOR
US
THEY
COOKED
FOR
US
ON
THEIR
FIELD
STOVES
AND
PROVIDED
US
WITH
WONDERFUL
FOOD
BUT
THE
THING
IS
THAT
THEIR
MAIN
JOB
WAS
TO
FERRET
OUT
THE
GANG
THAT
WAS
STILL
AT
IT
EVERYWHERE
THAT
WAS
CONTINUING
ITS
SORDID
AFFAIRS
EVERYWHERE
PLUS
THEY
WERE
NEVER
GIVEN
ANY
DIRECT
ORDERS
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
WERE
AUTHORIZED
TO
DO
AND
NOT
TO
DO
AND
IT
WAS
ONLY
ON
MARCH
AT
FIVE
OCLOCK
IN
THE
EVENING
THAT
KRAYEV
HIMSELF
THE
LIEUTENANT
GENERAL
THE
CITY
COMMANDANT
OF
SUMGAIT
WAS
GIVEN
FULL
AUTHORITY
AND
TOLD
EVERYONE
OVER
A
MICROPHONE
FROM
AN
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
THAT
NOW
HE
COULD
DO
WHAT
HE
WANTED
TO
DO
AS
HIS
HEART
ADVISED
HIM
AND
RELOCATE
PEOPLE
TO
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
BUT
THATS
NOT
WHAT
I
WANT
TO
TALK
ABOUT
NOW
MUSLIMZADE
CHARACTERISTICALLY
TRIED
TO
GET
ME
OUT
OF
THE
SK
BUILDING
AND
TAKE
ME
TO
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
WHICH
IS
ACROSS
THE
SQUARE
FROM
THE
CLUB
HE
TOOK
ME
BY
THE
HAND
AND
SAID
CITIZEN
DONT
WORRY
WELL
GO
AND
HAVE
A
TALK
IN
MY
OFFICE
I
TOLD
HIM
NO
AFTER
EVERYTHING
YOUVE
DONE
I
DONT
BELIEVE
ONE
IOTA
OF
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IF
I
GO
TO
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
ILL
DISAPPEAR
AND
THE
TRACES
OF
ME
WILL
DISAPPEAR
TOO
BECAUSE
YOU
CANT
STAND
IT
WHEN
OH
YES
AND
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
INTERESTING
DETAIL
FROM
THAT
MEETING
IT
WAS
EVEN
VERY
FUNNY
ALTHOUGH
AT
THE
TIME
I
WASNT
UP
TO
LAUGHING
HE
WAS
IN
A
NICE
EXPENSIVE
HAT
AND
SO
AS
TO
PUT
HIM
TO
SHAME
SO
TO
SPEAK
I
SAID
OH
WHY
DID
YOU
COME
HERE
ALL
DUDED
UP
LIKE
A
LONDON
DANDY
YOU
SMELL
OF
GOOD
PERFUME
YOURE
IN
YOUR
STARCHED
SHIRT
AND
YOU
HAVE
YOUR
EXPENSIVE
HAT
ON
YOU
CAME
TO
RIDICULE
THE
POOR
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
WHO
ARE
LYING
ON
THE
FLOOR
WHO
ARE
ALREADY
GETTING
SICK
WHOSE
RELATIVES
HAVE
DIED
DID
YOU
COME
TO
LAUGH
AT
THEM
AND
THE
ONE
WHO
WAS
ACCOMPANYING
HIM
AN
AZERBAIJANI
I
DONT
KNOW
WHO
HE
WAS
OR
WHAT
HIS
TITLE
WAS
HE
QUICKLY
SNATCHED
THE
HAT
OFF
MUSLIMZADES
HEAD
AND
HID
IT
THEN
I
SAID
MY
GOD

NOT
MARAUDERS
WERE
NOT
YOU
WE
DIDNT
COME
TO
YOU
WITH
THE
INTENTION
OF
STEALING

WAY
BUT
GIVE
US
AN
ANSWER
WERE
ASKING
YOU
WHERE
WERE
YOU
WHEN
THEY
WERE
TORTURING
AND
RAPING
THOSE
POOR
WOMEN
WHEN
THEY
WERE
KILLING
THE
CHILDREN
BURNING
THINGS
CARRYING
ON
OUTRAGEOUSLY
AND
WRECKING
ALL
THOSE
APARTMENTS
WHERE
WERE
YOU
THEN
YOU
KNOW
WE
DIDNT
EXPECT
IT
WE
DID
NOT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
WE
DIDNT
ANTICIPATE
THAT
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IN
SUMGAIT
I
STARTED
LAUGHING
AND
SAID
ITS
TRULY
FUNNY
HE
SAYS
WHAT
COULD
I
DO
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
AND
I
SAY
IM
SORRY
BUT
ITLL
BE
RIDICULOUS
IF
I
TELL
YOU
THE
FIRST
SECRETARY
OF
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
SHOULDNT
MARCH
OUT
IN
FRONT
WITH
A
BANNER
HE
SHOULD
FALL
DOWN
SO
THAT
THE
GANG
WOULD
HAVE
TO
CROSS
OVER
HIS
DEAD
BODY
THATS
WHAT
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
DONE
THATS
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
DURING
THE
WAR
NOT
A
SINGLE
PARTY
COMMITTEE
SECRETARY
COMPROMISED
HIMSELF
EITHER
HE
DIED
OR
HE
LED
PEOPLE
INTO
BATTLE
AND
WHAT
DID
YOU
DO
YOU
RAN
AWAY
YOU
LEFT
YOU
HID
YOU
MARCHED
WITH
A
FLAG
BECAUSE
YOU
WERE
AFRAID
EXCUSE
MY
LANGUAGE
YOU
FEARED
FOR
YOUR
OWN
DAMNED
HIDE
AND
WHEN
WE
ASK
YOU
YOU
TELL
US
THAT
YOU
GOT
CONFUSED
AND
YOU
ASK
ME
WHAT
YOU
COULD
HAVE
DONE
THATS
RIGHT
I
TOLD
HIM
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
GOT
CONFUSED
ALL
THE
PARTY
COMMITTEES
GOT
CONFUSED
THE
POLICE
GOT
CONFUSED
BAKU
GOT
CONFUSED
THEY
ALL
LAY
IN
A
FAINT
FOR
TWO
WEEKS
AND
THE
GANG
RAN
THE
SHOW
WITH
IMPUNITY
AND
IF
IT
WERENT
FOR
THE
TROOPS
IT
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
JUST
TWO
DAYS
THERE
WOULDNT
BE
A
SINGLE
ARMENIAN
LEFT
IN
SUMGAIT
FOR
SURE
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
FINISHED
THEIR
BLOODY
AFFAIR
BECAUSE
THEY
BRAZENLY
WENT
UP
TO
SOME
RUSSIANS
TOO
THE
ONES
WHO
TRIED
TO
SAY
SOMETHING
TO
THEM
AND
THEY
TOLD
THEM
AS
SOON
AS
WE
FINISH
WITH
THE
ARMENIANS
WELL
COME
AFTER
YOU
TOO
AND
BY
THE
WAY
THERE
WAS
A
COLONEL
WHO
TOOK
US
TO
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
HE
WAS
THE
ONE
WITH
THE
LIGHT
BLUE
COLLAR
TABS
WHO
FLEW
IN
AND
TWO
HOURS
LATER
ARRIVED
ON
AN
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
WHEN
WE
WERE
AT
THE
SK
AND
TOOK
US
TO
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
AND
WHO
LATER
STARTED
MOVING
US
FROM
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
WE
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
HOW
WHAT
WILL
COME
OF
US
HE
OPENLY
SAID
YOU
KNOW
FOR
US
THE
MAIN
THING
NOW
IS
TO
CATCH
THAT
GANG
WELL
FINISH
THAT
QUICKLY
YOULL
STAY
AT
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
FOR
THE
TIME
BEING
AND
WELL
DECIDE
LATER
THE
GENERAL
PROCURACY
OF
THE
USSR
ARRIVED
IT
CONSISTS
OF
INVESTIGATORS
FROM
ALL
CITIES
THERE
WERE
SOME
FROM
STAVROPOL
FROM
EVERYWHERE
JUST
EVERYWHERE
BECAUSE
THE
AFFAIR
WAS
TRULY
FRIGHTFUL
ABOUT
THIS
BY
THE
WAY
COMRADE
KATUSEV
SPOKE
AS
EVERYONE
KNOWS
HES
THE
FIRST
DEPUTY
GENERAL
PROCURATOR
OF
THE
USSR
WHEN
HE
GAVE
US
A
SPEECH
FROM
THE
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
AT
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
BY
THE
WAY
HE
TOLD
US
THE
HONEST
TRUTH
BECAUSE
HE
COULDNT
NOT
SAY
IT
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
STILL
EXPERIENCING
HIS
FIRST
IMPRESSIONS
OF
WHAT
HE
HAD
SEEN
AND
HE
SAID
THERE
WAS
AFGHANISTAN
AND
IT
WAS
BAD
BUT
SUMGAITITS
HORRIBLE
AND
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DARED
TO
DO
SUCH
A
THING
WILL
BE
SEVERELY
PUNISHED
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
OUR
LAWS
AND
THATS
A
QUOTE
THEN
ONE
MOTHER
THROWS
HERSELF
AT
HIMHER
TWO
SONS
HAD
DIED
BEFORE
HER
VERY
EYESAND
SAYS
WHO
WILL
RETURN
MY
SONS
WHO
IS
GOING
TO
PUNISH
THE
CULPRITS
THEY
TRIED
TO
CALM
HER
DOWN
AND
HE
SAID
IN
ORDER
FOR
US
TO
CONDUCT
A
PROPER
INVESTIGATION
IN
ORDER
THAT
NOT
A
SINGLE
SCOUNDREL
AVOID
RESPONSIBILITY
YOU
MUST
HELP
US
BECAUSE
WE
DONT
KNOW
MAYBE
THERE
WAS
SOMEONE
ELSE
IN
THE
GANG
WHO
IS
NOW
BEING
CONCEALED
IN
HOMES
AND
MAYBE
THE
NEIGHBORS
KNOW
MAYBE
SOMEONE
SAW
SOMETHING
DONT
BE
AFRAID
WRITE
ABOUT
IT
IN
DETAIL
SO
THAT
YOURE
NOT
AFRAID
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
MANY
OF
YOU
ARE
AFRAID
HAVING
LIVED
THROUGH
SUCH
HORRORS
THEY
THINK
THAT
IF
THEY
WRITE
THE
WHOLE
TRUTH
ABOUT
LETS
SAY
THEIR
NEIGHBOR
OR
SOMEONE
ELSE
THAT
THEY
WILL
SEEK
REVENGE
LATER
WERE
GOING
TO
DO
IT
LIKE
THIS
WERE
GOING
TO
SET
UP
AN
URN
AND
YOU
CAN
THROW
WHAT
YOU
WRITE
IN
THERE
WE
DONT
NEED
TO
KNOW
WHO
WROTE
IT
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WRITE
WONT
BE
MADE
PUBLIC
BUT
WE
NEED
ALL
THE
INFORMATION
LET
EACH
AND
EVERY
ONE
NOT
BE
AFRAID
LET
EACH
WRITE
WHAT
IS
NECESSARY
WHO
THEY
SAW
IN
THAT
GANG
WHO
MADE
THREATS
OR
SHOUTED
THREATENING
GIBES
ABOUT
THE
ARMENIANS
YOU
MUST
DESCRIBE
ALL
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
AND
PUT
THE
INFORMATION
INTO
THE
URN
TWO
SOLDIERS
AND
A
MAJOR
GUARDED
THE
URN
AND
SURE
ENOUGH
MANY
PEOPLE
PEOPLE
WHO
DIDNT
EVEN
WANT
TO
WRITE
I
KNOW
ONE
WOMAN
WHO
ASKED
ME
SHE
CAME
UP
AND
SAID
YOU
AS
A
RUSSIAN
THE
SAME
THING
WONT
HAPPEN
TO
YOU
AS
WILL
HAPPEN
TO
ME
SO
PLEASE
ILL
GIVE
YOU
THE
INFORMATION
AND
YOU
PLEASE
WRITE
IT
DOWN
FOR
ME
SO
SHE
WAS
AFRAID
AND
THERE
WERE
A
LOT
LIKE
HER
BUT
LATER
AFTER
KATUSEV
MADE
HIS
SPEECH
SHE
SAT
AND
WROTE
DOWN
EVERYTHING
SHE
KNEW
AND
WE
THREW
IT
ALL
INTO
THE
URN
NOW
WE
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
WILL
BE
OF
ANY
USE
FOR
A
FACTUAL
PICTURE
WILL
EMERGE
FROM
ALL
THAT
INFORMATION
ONE
PERSON
CAN
LIE
BUT
THOUSANDS
CANT
LIE
THOUSANDS
SIMPLY
CANT
LIE
YOU
HAVE
TO
AGREE
WITH
THAT
A
FACT
IS
A
FACT
WHY
FOR
EXAMPLE
SHOULD
SOMEONE
SAY
THAT
BLACK
IS
WHITE
IF
IT
IS
REALLY
BLACK
THE
FIRST
DEPUTY
CHAIRMAN
OF
THE
COUNCIL
OF
MINISTERS
OF
THE
AZERBAIJANI
SSR
MAMEDOV
AS
I
SAID
WAS
IN
YEREVAN
MY
HUSBAND
AND
I
WERE
AT
THE
COUNCIL
OF
MINISTERS
OF
THE
ARMENIAN
SSR
AND
FOUND
OUT
THAT
MAMEDOV
WAS
PRESENT
THE
ONE
WHO
HAD
COME
TO
CONVINCE
THE
PEOPLE
OF
SUMGAIT
TO
RETURN
TO
THEIR
PREVIOUS
DWELLINGS
TO
THEIR
OLD
APARTMENTS
WE
ASKED
FOR
A
MEETING
WITH
HIM
AND
IT
WAS
GRANTED
WHEN
WE
WENT
TO
SEE
HIM
HE
TRIED
TO
BEHAVE
PROPERLY
VERY
POLITELY
DELICATELY
BUT
WHEN
THE
TRUTH
WAS
TOLD
RIGHT
TO
HIS
FACE
AND
WHEN
I
ASKED
HIM
SOME
OF
THE
SAME
QUESTIONS
I
HAD
ASKED
MUSLIMZADE
WHERE
WERE
YOU
PERSONALLY
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BEATING
US
NOW
YOURE
TRYING
TO
CONVINCE
US
TO
RETURN
WHY
DIDNT
YOU
THINK
AT
THE
TIME
THAT
THEY
WERE
SLAUGHTERING
US
WHERE
IT
WAS
ALL
LEADING
HE
SAYS
YOURE
TELLING
THE
TRUTH
LETS
NOT
MINCE
WORDS
YOUVE
TOLD
ME
RIGHT
TO
MY
FACE
AND
ILL
TELL
YOU
STRAIGHT
ILL
TELL
YOU
THE
PURE
TRUTH
I
WAS
GOTTEN
OUT
OF
BED
IN
THE
EVENING
THE
WHOLE
GOVERNMENT
WAS
UP
INCLUDING
ME
AND
WE
WERE
RESTRAINING
A
CROWD
OF
ABOUT
IN
BAKU
BUT
WE
NEVER
EXPECTED
THAT
IN
A
CITY
LIKE
SUMGAIT
WITH
ITS
FINE
INTERNATIONAL
RECORD
SUCH
A
THING
COULD
HAPPEN
WE
EXPECTED
IT
IN
BAKU
I
SAY
SO
THAT
MEANS
YOU
EXPECTED
IT
ALL
THE
SAME
WHY
WERE
YOU
EXPECTING
IT
AND
HE
SAYS
YOU
KNOW
IT
JUST
HAPPENED
THAT
WAY
WE
WERE
EXPECTING
IT
IN
BAKU
WE
WERE
TRYING
TO
RESTRAIN
IT
BUT
IN
SUMGAIT
I
SAY
FINE
YOU
DIDNT
KNOW
FOR
THE
FIRST
THREE
OR
FOUR
HOURS
BUT
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
WHY
DID
NO
ONE
HELP
US
AND
HE
SAYS
WELL
OK
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
AND
THINGS
LIKE
THAT
BASICALLY
IT
WAS
THE
SAME
STORY
I
GOT
FROM
MUSLIMZADE
LATER
WHEN
HE
SAID
YOU
GO
ON
BACK
THE
SITUATION
IN
SUMGAIT
IS
FAVORABLE
NOW
EVERYTHING
IS
FINE
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
FRIENDLY
WITH
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
TO
THIS
L
ANSWERED
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
IM
SPEAKING
WITH
YOU
AS
A
MEMBER
OF
A
NEUTRAL
NATION
I
HAVE
NEVER
ARGUED
WITH
ARMENIANS
OR
WITH
AZERBAIJANIS
AND
I
WAS
AN
EYEWITNESS
YOU
TELL
ME
PLEASE
COMRADE
MAMEDOV
I
ASKED
HIM
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
SAY
ABOUT
THIS
HONESTLY
IF
YOU
WERE
BEING
COMPLETELY
FRANK
WITH
US
THEN
HE
SAID
YES
I
ADMIT
THAT
I
AM
HONESTLY
ASHAMED
SHAME
ON
THE
ENTIRE
AZERBAIJANI
NATION
WE
HAVE
DISGRACED
OURSELVES
NOT
ONLY
BEFORE
THE
ENTIRE
SOVIET
UNION
BUT
BEFORE
THE
WHOLE
WORLD
BECAUSE
NOW
THE
VOICE
OF
AMERICA
AND
ALL
THE
OTHER
FOREIGN
RADIO
STATIONS
OF
VARIOUS
HUES
ARE
BRANDING
US
WITH
ALL
KINDS
OF
RUMORS
TOO
AND
I
SAY
THERES
NOTHING
TO
ADD
TO
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENED
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
POSSIBLE
TO
ADD
ANYTHING
MORE
AWFUL
HE
SAYS
YES
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
I
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
PAIN
IT
IS
TRULY
AN
UNFORTUNATE
OCCURRENCE
I
REPEAT
THAT
HE
SAID
UNFORTUNATE
OCCURRENCE
AND
THEN
HE
SUDDENLY
REMEMBERED
HIMSELF
WHAT
HE
WAS
SAYINGHE
HAD
A
PEN
IN
HIS
HANDS
HE
WAS
FIDGETING
WITH
IT
NERVOUSLY
AND
SAID
OH
EXCUSE
ME
A
TRAGEDY
REALLY
I
TAKE
THIS
TO
MEAN
THAT
HE
REALLY
THINKS
ITS
AN
UNFORTUNATE
OCCURRENCE
AND
OF
COURSE
HE
SAYS
I
UNDERSTAND
THAT
HAVING
GONE
THROUGH
ALL
THIS
YOU
CANT
RETURN
TO
SUMGAIT
BUT
ITS
NECESSARY
TO
COOL
DOWN
AND
REALIZE
THAT
ALL
THOSE
PEOPLE
ARE
BEING
TRIED
AND
HE
EVEN
GAVE
A
DETAIL
WHICH
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
MATTERS
OR
NOT
THAT
POLICEMEN
WERE
BEING
TRIED
SPECIFICALLY
IN
RELATION
TO
THAT
BLOODY
AFFAIR
YES
BY
THE
WAY
THERE
IS
ANOTHER
GOOD
DETAIL
HOW
I
WAS
SET
UP
AT
WORK
IN
BAKU
AFTER
THE
EVENTS
I
WENT
TO
AN
UNDERGARMENT
PLANT
THERE
WAS
AN
AZERBAIJANI
WORKING
THERE
AND
SUDDENLY
SHE
TELLS
ME
WHAT
THEY
DIDNT
NAIL
YOUR
HUSBAND
THEY
SCREWED
UP
I
WAS
FLOORED
I
HADNT
IMAGINED
THAT
ANYONE
IN
BAKU
TOO
COULD
SAY
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
WELL
AFTER
THAT
I
WENT
UP
TO
SEE
TO
MY
OFFICE
I
NEEDED
TO
FIND
OUT
ABOUT
THOSE
DAYS
WHAT
WAS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
WITH
THEM
HOW
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
PUT
DOWN
THOSE
DAYS
FROM
FEBRUARY
TO
MARCH
AND
THE
ADMINISTRATOR
TOLD
ME
I
DONT
KNOW
TATYANA
GO
TO
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
CONDUCTORS
POOL
BE
GRATEFUL
IF
THEY
DONT
PUT
IT
DOWN
AS
UNEXCUSED
ABSENCE
I
WAS
REALLY
DISCOURAGED
BY
THIS
THEY
ALL
KNOW
THAT
WE
WERE
BUT
A
HAIR
AWAY
FROM
DEATH
AND
BARELY
SURVIVED
AND
HERE
THEYRE
TELLING
ME
THAT
I
WAS
SKIPPING
WORK
AS
THOUGH
I
WAS
OFF
ENJOYING
MYSELF
SOMEWHERE
I
WENT
TO
THE
OFFICE
OF
THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
POOL
HIS
LAST
NAME
IS
RASULOV
AND
HES
HAD
THAT
POSITION
FOR
MANY
YEARS
INCIDENTALLY
HES
A
PARTY
MEMBER
AND
IS
A
BIG
MAN
IN
TOWN
AND
SUDDENLY
WHEN
I
WENT
TO
HIM
AND
SAID
COMRADE
RASULOV
THIS
IS
THE
WAY
IT
WAS
HE
LOOKED
AT
ME
ASKANCE
AND
SAID
AND

MY
PREVIOUS
LAST
NAMEWHY

WRAPPED
UP
IN
THIS
MESS
MY
HUSBANDS
AN
ARMENIAN
I
TELL
HIM
I
HAVE
AN
ARMENIAN
LAST
NAME
AND
HE
SCREWED
UP
HIS
FACE
MADE
A
KIND
OF
A
GRIMACE
AS
THOUGH
HE
HAD
EATEN
SOMETHING
SOUR
AND
SAID
I
DIDNT
EXPECT
THAT
YOU
WOULD
WHAT
DID
HE
MEAN
BY
THAT
AND
HOW
SHOULD
HE
BEHAVE
THE
CHIEF
OF
THE
POOL
A
MAN
WHO
SUPERVISES
WORKERS
NOW
ITS
TRUE
THERE
WAS
A
REDUCTION
BUT
FOR
SURE
THERE
ARE
STILL
CONDUCTORS
WORKING
FOR
HIM
AND
IF
SOMEONE
WHO
SUPERVISES
A
STAFF
THAT
SIZE
SAYS
THINGS
LIKE
THAT
THEN
WHAT
CAN
YOU
EXPECT
FROM
A
SIMPLE
UNEDUCATED
POLITICALLY
UNSOPHISTICATED
PERSON
HES
GOING
TO
BELIEVE
ANY
AND
ALL
RUMORS
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
LIKE
THIS
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
LIKE
THAT
AND
SO
ON
BY
THE
WAY
THAT
MAMEDOVNOW
IM
GOING
BACK
TO
MAMEDOVS
OFFICE
WHEN
I
ASKED
HIM
ARE
YOU
REALLY
GOING
TO
GUARANTEE
THE
SAFETY
OF
OUR
LIVES
IF
WE
RETURN
TO
SUMGAIT
HE
ANSWERED
YES
YOU
KNOW
I
WOULD
GUARANTEE
THEM
I
DONT
WANT
TO
TAKE
ON
TOO
MUCH
I
WOULD
GUARANTEE
THEM
FIRMLY
FOR
YEARS
BUT
I
WONT
GUARANTEE
THEM
FOR
LONGER
THAN
YEARS
I
SAY
SO
YOUVE
GOT
ANOTHER
THING
LIKE
THAT
PLANNED
FOR
YEARS
FROM
NOW
SO
THEYLL
BE
QUIET
AND
THEN
IN
ANOTHER
YEARS
ITLL
HAPPEN
AGAIN
I
COULDNT
CONTAIN
MYSELF
ANY
MORE
AND
I
ALSO
TOLD
HIM
AND
HOW
DID
IT
GET
TO
THAT
POINT
CERTAINLY
YOU
KNEW
ABOUT
IT
HOW
THEY
WERE
TREATING
THE
RUSSIANS
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
BAKU
AND
IN
SUMGAIT
HOW
THEY
WERE
HOUNDED
FROM
THEIR
JOBS
CERTAINLY
YOU
RECEIVED
COMPLAINTS
I
WROTE
SOME
MYSELF
WHY
DID
NO
ONE
RESPOND
TO
THEM
WHY
DID
EVERYONE
IGNORE
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
DIDNT
YOU
PREPARE
PEOPLE
FOR
THIS
BY
THE
WAY
YOU
TREATED
THEM
AND
HE
SAYS
YOU
KNOW
YOURE
FINALLY
STARTING
TO
INSULT
ME
HE
THREW
HIS
PEN
ON
THE
DESK
MAYBE
NOW
YOULL
SAY
IM
A
SCOUNDREL
TOO
I
SAY
YOU
KNOW
IM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
YOU
BECAUSE
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
ABOUT
THE
ONES
WHO
I
DO
KNOW
I
CAN
SAY
WITH
CONVICTION
YES
THAT
COMRADE
WAS
INVOLVED
IN
THIS
THAT
AND
THAT
BECAUSE
I
KNOW
FOR
CERTAIN
WELL
ANYWAY
HE
ASSURED
US
THAT
HERE
IN
YEREVAN
THERE
WERE
FALSE
RUMORS
THAT
SUMGAIT
ARMENIANS
WERE
HERE
AND
WERE
IN
SUMGAIT
AND
HAD
GOTTEN
BACK
TO
WORK
EVERYONE
WAS
WORKING
HE
SAID
AND
LIFE
WAS
VERY
GOOD
WE
DROVE
ABOUT
THE
TOWN
OURSELVES
COMRADE
ARUTIUNIAN
FIRST
SECRETARY
OF
THE
COMMUNIST
PARTY
OF
ARMENIA
SSR
CAME
FROM
THE
COUNCIL
OF
MINISTERS
OF
ARMENIAN
HE
CAME
AND
BROUGHT
INFORMATION
SHOWING
THAT
EVERYTHING
WAS
FINE
IN
SUMGAIT
WHEN
I
ASKED
MAMEDOV
HOW
HE
HAD
REACHED
THAT
CONCLUSION
HE
SAID
WELL
I
WALKED
DOWN
THE
STREET
AND
I
SAID
WALKING
DOWN
THE
STREET
IN
ANY
CITY
EVEN
IF
I
WERE
TO
GO
TO
NEW
YORK
I
WOULD
NEVER
UNDERSTAND
THE
SITUATION
BECAUSE
I
WOULD
BE
A
GUEST
I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
CONTACT
WITH
PEOPLE
BUT
IF
YOU
SPEND
DAYS
AMONG
SOME
BLUECOLLAR
WORKERS
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
YOU
WERE
THE
FIRST
DEPUTY
CHAIRMAN
OF
THE
COUNCIL
OF
MINISTERS
YOUD
HEAR
SOMETHING
QUITE
DIFFERENT
I
TOLD
HIM
FOR
EXAMPLE
THAT
I
DREW
MY
CONCLUSION
WHEN
WE
LEFT
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
TO
LOOK
AT
OUR
APARTMENTS
THEY
TOOK
US
ALL
IN
TURNS
TO
PICK
THINGS
UP
SINCE
PEOPLE
HAD
FLED
TO
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
THEY
GOT
ON
THE
BUS
JUST
TO
SAVE
THEMSELVES
AS
SOON
AS
POSSIBLE
HOW
ARE
THE
NEIGHBORS
IN
THE
MICRODISTRICT
HOW
WILL
THEY
VIEW
US
WHAT
DO
THEY
THINK
I
THOUGHT
MAYBE
THAT
IN
FACT
IT
WASNT
SOMETHING
GENERAL
OF
A
MASS
NATURE
SOME
ANTINATIONAL
SOMETHING
AND
WHEN
THAT
BUS
TOOK
US
TO
OUR
BUILDING
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
THE
SAME
BUS
WHILE
WE
WERE
GOING
