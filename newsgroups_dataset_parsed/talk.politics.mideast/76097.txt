SHAI
GUDAY
WRITES
SNIP
IMAGINE
IT
IS
NOT
A
TERRORIST
CAMP
AS
YOU
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
LIKE
TO
VIEW
THE
VILLAGES
THEY
ARE
SMALL
COMMUNITIES
WITH
KIDS
PLAYING
SOCCER
IN
THE
STREETS
WOMEN
PREPARING
LUNCH
MEN
PLAYING
CARDS
ETC
I
WOULD
NOT
ARGUE
THAT
ALL
OR
EVEN
MOST
OF
THE
VILLAGES
ARE
TERRORIST
CAMPS
THERE
ARE
HOWEVER
SOME
WHICH
COME
VERY
CLOSE
TO
SERVING
THAT
PURPOSE
AND
THAT
IS
NOT
TO
SAY
THAT
OTHER
DID
NOT
FUNCTION
IN
THAT
WAY
PRIOR
TO
THE
INVASION
THE
VILLAGE
I
DESCRIBED
WAS
ACTUALLY
THE
CLOSEST
I
COULD
COME
TO
DESCRIBING
MINE
I
AGREE
THERE
MAY
BE
OTHER
VILLAGES
WHERE
THE
CIVILIAN
POPULATION
HAS
DESERTED
BECAUSE
IT
IS
TOO
CLOSE
TO
ISRAELI
LINES
AND
THUS
GETS
BOMBED
MORE
OFTEN
IN
SUCH
VILLAGES
OFTEN
THE
ONLY
REMAINING
INHABITANTS
ARE
GUERILLAS
AND
SOME
ELDERLY
WHO
HAVE
NOWHERE
ELSE
TO
GO
BUT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THE
TYPICAL
SOUTH
LEBANON
VILLAGE
IS
MORE
LIKE
MINE
ONE
WHERE
CIVILIANS
AND
GUERILLAS
LIVE
TOGETHER
THEY
ARE
OFTEN
INHABITING
THE
SAME
HOUSE
MANY
FAMILIES
ARE
LARGE
SOME
HAVE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
FAMILIES
INVOLVED
IN
HIZOLLAH
MOST
OTHERS
ARE
NOT
THAT
IS
WHAT
IS
SO
HARD
OF
SOUTH
LEBANON
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
FIGHTING
AN
ARMY
WITH
WELL
DRAWN
BATTLE
LINES
BUT
A
GUERILLA
TYOE
RESISTANCE
WHICH
BY
DEFINITION
AND
NECESSITY
BLENDS
WITH
THE
LOCAL
POPULACE
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
EVIL
COWARDS
THAT
USE
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
AS
SHIELDS
BUT
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
ONLY
WAY
ONE
CAN
FIGHT
A
MORE
POWERFUL
BETTER
EQUIPPED
OCCUPYING
ARMY
SOME
OF
THE
VILLAGES
AND
YOURS
MIGHT
WELL
BE
AMONG
THEM
ARE
AS
YOU
DESCRIBE
NOT
ALL
ARE
THERE
ARE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
GROUPS
IN
THE
AREA
BACKED
BY
VARIOUS
ORGANIZATIONS
WITH
A
WIDE
RANGE
OF
PURPOSES
HIZBOLLAH
AND
AMAL
WERE
TWO
OF
THE
LARGER
ONES
AND
MAY
STILL
BE
HIZBOLLAH
AND
AMAL
ARE
NOW
THE
MAIN
TWO
MILITIAS
THOUGH
HIZBOLLAH
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
BE
MORE
COMMITTED
TO
RESISTRANCE
OPERATION
AND
BETTER
MOTIVATED
BY
RELIGIOUS
CONVICTION
AS
TO
RETALIATION
WHILE
MISTAKES
MAY
BE
MADE
THAT
IS
STILL
A
FAR
CRY
FROM
INDISCRIMINATE
BOMBING
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
PRODUCED
MAJOR
CASUALTIES
IT
MAY
BE
A
MIXTURE
OF
WHAT
WE
BOTH
SAY
SOMETIMES
ISRAEL
CHOOSES
ITS
TARGETS
CAREFULLY
AT
OTHER
TIMES
IT
JUST
SENDS
ITS
PILOTS
ON
SORTIES
AIMED
AT
A
TOWN
IN
GENERAL
SINCE
IT
ONLY
KNOWS
THAT
THE
ATTACKERS
CAME
FROM
THAT
SPECIFIC
VILLAGE
BUT
HAS
NO
FURTHER
INTELLIGENCE
ON
SEVERAL
OCCASIONS
ISRAEL
RETALLIATED
AGAINST
CIVILIAN
REFUGEE
CAMPS
EVEN
IN
NORTH
LEBANON
JUST
TO
SHOW
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
SIT
IDLY
AFTER
ITS
SOLDIERS
HAVE
BEEN
ATTACKED
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
IT
DIRECTS
THE
SLA
TO
DO
THE
DIRTY
WORK
AND
INDISCRIMINATELY
SHELL
SOME
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
I
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
THIS
SHELLING
MYSELF
ON
SEVERAL
OCCASIONS
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
SLA
MILITIA
IS
SOMETIMES
EVEN
MORE
DESPISED
THAN
ISRAELI
TROOPS
WELL
HERE
WE
DISAGREE
I
THINK
THAT
ISRAEL
WOULD
WILLINGLY
WITHDRAW
IF
THE
LEBANESE
GOVT
WAS
ABLE
TO
FIELD
A
RELIABLE
FORCE
IN
THE
AREA
TO
POLICE
IT
AND
PREVENT
FURTHER
ATTACKS
I
HOPE
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
ON
ISRAELI
WILLINGNESS
TO
WITHDRAW
BUT
I
STILL
CONTEND
THAT
WITHDRAWAL
WOULD
BE
THE
BETTER
COURSE
FOR
ISRAELS
SECURITY
SINCE
IT
WOULD
REDUCE
ITS
MILITARY
LOSSES
AND
I
CLAIM
THAT
THE
LEBANESE
AND
SYRIAN
GOVTS
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PREVENT
ANY
FURTHER
ATTACKS
ON
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
VERY
LITTLE
INCENTIVE
FOR
THE
SYRIAN
AND
LEBANESE
GOOVERNMENT
TO
ALLOW
HIZBOLLAH
TO
BOMB
ISRAEL
PROPER
UNDER
SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES
AND
NOW
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
PROVEN
THAT
IT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
CONTROLLING
AND
DISARMING
ALL
MILITIAS
AS
THEY
DID
IN
ALL
OTHER
PARTS
OF
LEBANON
NO
THE
SYRIAN
GOVT
IS
MORE
THAN
HAPPY
TO
HAVE
ISRAEL
SINK
INTO
ANOTHER
LEBANESE
MORASS
I
COULD
ELABORATE
IF
NECESSARY
HMM
HERE
WE
DISAGREE
ON
WHAT
SERVES
SYRIA
INTERESTS
BETTER
I
THINK
SYRIA
WANTS
TO
HAVE
LEBANON
ALL
TO
ITSELF
IT
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
GUARANTEE
NORTHERN
ISRAELS
SECURITY
IN
RETURN
FOR
ISRAELI
WITHDRAWAL
I
DONT
THINK
SYRIA
WANTS
ISRAEL
TO
BE
INVOLVED
IN
ITS
PROTECTORATE
OF
LEBANON
SYRIA
IS
SITTING
AT
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
COME
TO
ACCEPT
THAT
AND
WANTS
TO
GET
A
POLITICAL
RESOLUTION
A
RENEWAL
OF
HOSTILITIES
ALONG
THE
LEBANESE
FRONT
COULD
PUT
THE
WHOLE
ME
PEACE
NEGOTIATIONS
BACK
IN
QUESTION
I
AGREE
ONLY
IN
THE
CASE
OF
THE
ISARELI
SOLDIERS
THEIR
KILLING
CANNOT
BE
QUALIFIED
AS
MURDER
NO
MATTER
WHAT
YOU
SAY
NO
BUT
IT
IS
REGRETABLE
AS
IS
THE
WHOLE
SITUATION
I
AGREE
THAT
THE
LOSS
OF
ANY
HUMAN
LIFE
IS
DEPLORABLE
AND
REGRETTABLE
