RE
DEIR
YASSIN
IN
ARTICLE
GET
THEE
TO
A
NUNNERY
WRITES
THIS
IS
SUCH
BULLSHIT
DEIR
YASSIN
WAS
AN
UNPROVOKED
ATTACK
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
A
MASSACRE
DEFINES
IT
BEST
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
VILLAGE
OF
DEIR
YASSIN
HAD
HAD
A
PACT
WITH
THE
JEWS
A
PEACE
PACT
BUT
THE
IRGUN
PURPOSELY
BROKE
THIS
AGREEMENT
IN
ORDER
TO
SCARE
OFF
THE
PALESTINIANS
I
MIGHT
GRANT
THAT
THIS
VILLAGE
HOUSED
ARMED
ARABS
I
DOUBT
IT
BUT
NOTHING
IN
THE
ARCHIVES
AND
AVAILABLE
LITERATURE
INDICATES
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
MOTIVATING
FORCE
AMONGST
THE
IRGUN
THE
DEIR
YASSIN
MASSACRE
WAS
PART
OF
AN
OVER
ALL
STRATEGY
TO
INTIMIDATE
THE
PALESTINIANS
TO
FLEE
THE
JEWISH
HOMELANDAND
CONTRARY
TO
YOUR
BELIEF
MANY
CIVILIANS
WERE
KILLED
DEIR
YASSIN
WAS
LATER
ADVERTIZED
BY
THE
VERY
JEWS
WHO
PERPETRATED
IT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
USEFUL
IN
GETTING
MANY
PALESTINIANS
TO
LEAVE
THE
PALESTINIANS
WERE
RIGHTFULLY
SCARED
OFF
BECAUSE
THEY
DID
NOT
WANT
ANOTHER
DEIR
YASSIN
IM
NOT
NECESSARILY
CONDEMNING
THE
ISRAELITES
HERE
ATROCITIES
WERE
ASLO
COMMITTED
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
ARABS
ISRAELOPHILES
SHOULD
JUST
BE
CAREFUL
IN
THINKING
THAT
THEY
ARE
AND
WERE
THE
GOOD
GUYS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
BOTH
ARAB
AND
JEW
SUCK
EQUALLY
YOU
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
WHAT
MOTIVATED
THE
IRGUN
TO
ATTACK
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
ITS
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
IN
FACT
BEGIN
WHO
WAS
IN
CHARGE
OF
THE
IRGUN
WROTE
THAT
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
ATTACKED
FOR
ITS
MILITARY
SIGNIFICANCE
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
MERELY
A
BATTLE
IN
THE
WAR
OF
LIBERATION
PEOPLE
DIED
BUT
THE
THING
WAS
NEVER
INTENDED
TO
BE
A
MASACRE
THAT
THIS
HAPENNED
IS
A
TRAGEDY
OF
WAR
NOT
A
CRIME
OF
THE
IRGUN
