WRITES
THE
ISRAELI
LEFTS
INABILITY
TO
COPE
WITH
THE
CHALLENGES
IT
IS
PRESENTED
WITH
BY
REALITY
BECOMES
OBVIOUS
AT
THOSE
MOMENTS
WHEN
THE
REALITY
DOES
NOT
LINE
UP
WITH
THE
EXPECTATIONS
OF
THE
LEFT
WE
WERE
ABLE
TO
SEE
THIS
CLEARLY
DURING
THE
GULF
WAR
BECAUSE
OF
THE
PALESTINIANS
POPULAR
SOLIDARITY
WITH
IRAQ
YOSSI
SARID
CURRENTLY
MINISTER
OF
THE
ENVIRONMENT
MADE
HIS
INFAMOUS
STATEMENT
YOU
LOOK
FOR
ME
IE
IAM
NOT
MAKING
ANY
MORE
EFFORTS
TO
SPEAK
WITH
YOU
FROM
YOSSI
SARIDS
POINT
OF
VIEW
PALESTINIAN
REALITY
DURING
THE
GULF
WAR
WAS
NOT
THE
LENGTHY
CURFEW
OR
THE
DANGER
OF
HUNGER
IT
BROUGHT
WITH
IT
BUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
PALESTINIANS
ACCEPTED
WHAT
WAS
ACCEPTABLE
TO
THE
PARTY
SIMILARLY
MERETZ
MK
DEDDI
TZUKER
RECENTLY
FACED
WITH
CRITICISM
FROM
RESIDENTS
OF
THE
WEST
BANK
TOWN
OF
BEIT
SAHOUR
OVER
HIS
GOVERNMENTS
AND
HIS
PARTYS
LACK
OF
ACTION
FOR
HUMAN
RIGHTS
AND
PEACE
RESPONDED
BY
ASKING
THOSE
PRESENT
AT
THE
DISCUSSION
WHETHER
THEY
WOULD
RATHER
HAVE
A
LIKUD
GOVERNMENT
FROM
THE
LEFTISTS
PERSPECTIVE
THIS
IS
THE
BEST
GOVERNMENT
BECAUSE
IT
IS
THEIR
GOVERNMENT
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
IT
DOES
THESE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
ISRAELI
LEFT
HAVE
ALREADY
DECIDED
HOW
THE
FUTURE
OF
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
WILL
LOOK
AND
THEY
WANT
TO
DICTATE
TO
THE
PALESTINIANS
HOW
TO
GET
THERE
WHEN
SOMEONE
STARTS
CRITICIZING
THE
LEFTISTS
FOR
NOT
BEING
LEFTIST
ENOUGH
WE
GET
A
PRETTY
CLEAR
IDEA
OF
WHAT
THEY
BELIEVE
TO
BE
NORMAL
I
HOPE
THAT
YOUR
NOT
STILL
CALLING
YOURSELF
FAIR
AND
UNBIASED
