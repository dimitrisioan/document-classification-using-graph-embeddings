EUROPE
VS

BOSNIANS

MOHAMEDSSADEK
WRITES
I
LIKE
WHAT
MR
JOSEPH
BIDEN
HAD
TO
SAY
YESTERDAY
IN
THE
SENATE
CONDEMENING
THE
EUROPEAN
LACK
OF
ACTION
AND
LACK
OF
SUPPORT
TO
US
PLANS
AND
CALLING
THAT
MORAL
RAPE
HE
WENT
ON
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
REASON
FOR
THAT
IS
OUT
RIGHT
RELIGIOUS
BIGOTRY
ACTUALLY
THIS
STRIFE
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
GOES
BACK
A
LONG
WAY
BOSINAN
MUSLIMS
IN
COLLABORATION
WITH
THE
NAZIS
DID
TO
SERBIANS
AFTER
THE
FIRST
WORLD
WAR
WHAT
SERBS
ARE
DOING
TO
MUSLIMS
NOW
THIS
IS
NOT
A
FRESH
CASE
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
BUT
JUST
ANOTHER
CHAPTER
IN
THE
CONTINUING
SAGA
OF
INTENSE
MUTUAL
HATRED
DESTRUCTION
NOT
TAKING
SIDES
IN
THIS
PERPETUAL
WAR
DOES
NOT
AMOUNT
TO
RELIGIOUS
BIGOTRY
IT
COULD
JUST
BE
HELPLESSNESS
WITH
REGARDS
TO
BRINGING
PEACE
TO
A
REGION
THAT
DOES
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORD
SATYA
PRABHAKAR
MUSLIMS
HELPING
THE
NAZIS
WHERE
ON
EARTH
DO
YOU
COME
UP
WITH
SUCH
ACCUUSATION
DO
YOU
HAVE
PROOFS
IF
NOT
YOU
SHOULD
PUBLICALLY
APOLOGIZE
FOR
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
LAST
TIME
I
HEARD
THE
NAZIS
PRIDED
THEMSELVES
IN
NEEDING
NO
BODY
TO
CARRY
THEIR
POLITICS
AND
IDEOLOGIES
AND
IF
YOUR
STATMENT
WERE
TRUE
DONT
YOU
THINK
ISRAEL
WOULD
OF
USED
IT
TO
POINT
TO
WHAT
A
MUSLIM
NEIGHBOR
PALESTINE
COULD
DO
TO
THEM
IF
THEY
ALLOWED
IT
TO
BE
THE
JEWISH
LOBBY
AND
POWER
IS
VERY
STRONG
AND
IF
WHAT
YOU
SAID
IS
TRUE
WE
WOULD
OF
HEARD
IT
FROM
THEM
BEFORE
YOU
COULD
COME
UP
WITH
IT
AND
YOU
DARE
SAY
THAT
YOU
ARE
TAKING
NO
SIDES
MOHAMMED
