please
note

writes
you
guys
are
funny
its
funny
to
see
people
lose
control
and
start
the
name
calling
when
they
realize
they
have
no
point
comparing
israel
to
nazi
germany
is
namecalling
of
the
lowest
kind
please
dont
be
disingenuous
they
civil
libertarians
would
support
the
jews
against
the
nazis
or
anyone
else
who
tries
to
oppress
them
and
they
would
support
the
arabs
against
the
israelis
and
any
other
such
oppressive
regimes
iraq
etc
do
civil
libertarians
make
no
distinction
between
the
nazis
and
israel
would
you
say
that
the
iraqis
are
like
the
nazis
if
you
do
not
make
such
distinctions
then
all
injustices
are
equally
evil
and
the
world
is
a
completely
evil
place
in
that
case
we
may
as
well
give
up
right
now
