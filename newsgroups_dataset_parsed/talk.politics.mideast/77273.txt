while

to

the
mass

of
refugees
by
armenian
troops
as
we
swooped
low
over
the
snowcovered
hills
of
nagornokarabagh
we
saw
the
scattered
corpses
apparently
the
refugees
had
been
shot
down
as
they
ran
an
azerbaijani
film
of
the
places
we
flew
over

to

showed

lying
in

as
have

seven
of
us
squatted
in
the
cabin
of
an
azerbaijani
attack
helicopter
as
we
flew
to
investigate
the
claims
of
the
mass
killings
suddenly
there
was
a
thump
against
the
underside
of
the
aircraft
a
red
flash
of
tracer
ripped
past
the
starboard
wing
and
the
helicopter
rocked
sharply
we
swung
round
and
there
was
a
deafening
burst
of
fire
from
the
cannon
under
our
wing
as
the
helicopter
crew
returned
fire
we
had
been
fired
on
from
an
armenian
antiaircraft
post
we
swung
round
again
tipped
to
starboard
and
appeared
to
dive
straight
down
into
a
valley
the
brown
earth
swooped
around
our
heads
the
helicopter
swung
round
again
and
followed
the
contours
of
the
ground
our
cannon
fired
repeated
blasts
later
it
emerged
that
a
civilian
helicopter
that
we
had
been
escorting
had
landed
successfully
at
nakhichevanik
in
the
east
of
the
disputed
enclave
of
nagornokarabakh
to
pick
up
some
of
the
dead
we
had
in
fact
been
attacked
both
by
ground
fire
and
by
an
armenian
helicopter
i
had
seen
the
armenian
helicopter
intermittently
through
the
window
its
cannons
firing
but
had
thought
mistakenly
that
it
was
on
our
side
our
group
of
western
journalists
had
embarked
on
a
searchandrescue
flight
that
had
become
a
combat
mission
our
flight
consisted
of
the
civilian
passenger
helicopter
and
two
soviet
attack
helicopters
in
the
azerbaijani
service
nicknamed
flying
crocodiles
for
their
armour
our
party
was
in
the
second
crocodile
the
civilian
helicopters
job
was
to
land
in
the
mountains
and
pick
up
bodies
at
sites
of
the
mass
killings
the
attack
helicopters
were
there
to
give
covering
fire
if
necessary
the
operation
showed
a
striking
sign
of
the
disintegration
of
the
soviet
armed
forces
because
our
pilot
was
a
russian
officer
an
azerbaijani
official
told
us
that
there
were
now
five
former
soviet
military
helicopters
and
their
pilots
fighting
for
azerbaijan
they
have
signed
contracts
to
fly
for
us
he
said
the
helicopter
we
engaged
in
combat
was
most
probably
flown
by
a
brotherofficer
of
our
russian
pilot
but
fighting
for
the
armenians
we
had
taken
off
just
before
on
saturday
from
agdam
airfield
an
heated
for
the
armeniancontrolled
mountains
of
karabakh
a
sheer
white
wall
in
the
distance
the
civilian
helicopter
picked
up
four
corpses
and
it
was
during
this
and
a
previous
mission
that
an
azerbaijani
cameraman
filmed
the
several
the
several
dozen
bodies
on
the
hillsides
we
then
took
off
again
in
a
hurry
and
speed
back
towards
azerbaijani
lines
azerbaijani
gunners
on
the
last
hill
before
the
plain
and
safety
gazed
up
at
us
as
we
passed
back
at
the
airfield
in
agdam
we
took
a
look
the
bodies
the
civilian
helicopter
had
picked
up
two
old
men
a
small
girl
were
covered
with
blood
their
limbs
contorted
by
the
cold
and
rigor
mortis
they
had
been
shot
what
did
our
russian
pilot
think
of
the
tragedy
our
close
shave
and
the
war
in
nagornokarabakh
he
gave
us
cheerful
grin
politely
declined
to
answer
ques
tions
and
marched
off
to
his
dinner
serdar
argic
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
turks
and
then
proceeded
in
the
work
of
extermination

appressian
in

armenia
today
there
no
longer
exists
