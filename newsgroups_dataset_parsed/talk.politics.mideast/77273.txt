SUDDENLY
THERE
WAS
A

OF

A
RED
FLASH
OF

RIPPED
PAST
THE

WING
AND
THE

WE
SWUNG

THERE
WAS
A

THE

THAT
A

IN

SOME
OF

WE
HAD
IN

BEEN
ATTACKED
BOTH
BY

FIRE
AND
BY
AN

HELICOPTER
I
HAD
SEEN
THE
ARMENIAN
HELICOPTER
INTERMITTENTLY
THROUGH
THE

ITS

FIRING
BUT
HAD
THOUGHT
MISTAKENLY
THAT
IT
WAS
ON
OUR

OUR

OF
WESTERN

HAD
EMBARKED
ON
A
SEARCHANDRESCUE
FLIGHT
THAT
HAD
BECOME
A

OUR

CONSISTED
OF
THE
CIVILIAN
PASSENGER
HELICOPTER
AND
TWO
SOVIET
ATTACK
HELICOPTERS
IN
THE

SERVICE
NICKNAMED
FLYING

OUR

THE
CIVILIAN
HELICOPTERS
JOB
WAS
TO
LAND
IN
THE
MOUNTAINS
AND
PICK
UP
BODIES
AT

OF
THE
MASS
KILLINGS
THE
ATTACK
HELICOPTERS
WERE
THERE
TO
GIVE
COVERING
FIRE
IF
NECESSARY
THE
OPERATION
SHOWED
A
STRIKING
SIGN
OF
THE
DISINTEGRATION
OF
THE
SOVIET
ARMED
FORCES
BECAUSE
OUR
PILOT
WAS
A
RUSSIAN
OFFICER
AN
AZERBAIJANI
OFFICIAL
TOLD
US
THAT
THERE
WERE
NOW
FIVE
FORMER
SOVIET
MILITARY
HELICOPTERS
AND
THEIR
PILOTS
FIGHTING
FOR
AZERBAIJAN
THEY
HAVE
SIGNED
CONTRACTS
TO
FLY
FOR
US
HE
SAID
THE
HELICOPTER
WE
ENGAGED
IN
COMBAT
WAS
MOST
PROBABLY
FLOWN
BY
A
BROTHEROFFICER
OF
OUR
RUSSIAN

BUT
FIGHTING
FOR
THE

HAD
TAKEN
