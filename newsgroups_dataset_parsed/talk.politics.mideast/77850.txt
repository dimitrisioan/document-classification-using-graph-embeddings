RAFFI
R
KOJIAN
SAYS
IC
THERE
ARE
SOME
ARMENIANS
HERE
IN
THE
USA
IC
IN
FACT
THERE
ARE
SOME
AREAS
WHERE
ARMENIANS
ARE
MAJORITY
IC
SUPPOSE
A
LARGE
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
OF
ONE
OF
SUCH
AREA
DECIDES
IC
THAT
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
IS
NOT
REPRESENTING
THEIR
INTERESTS
AND
VOTE
FOR
IC
SEPERATION
FROM
THE
USA
THE
ARMENIANS
YOU
REFER
TO
HAVE
CHOSEN
TO
COME
TO
THE
UNITED
STATES
LAWFULLY
AND
PEACEFULLY
HOWEVER
IF
ARMENIANS
INVADE
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
FORCE
AMERICANS
TO
EITHER
FLEE
OR
BECOME
ARMENIANS
IT
WILL
NOT
SUCCEED
SIMILARLY
THE
ARMENIANS
OF
KARABAKH
ARE
BEING
FORCED
BY
AZERBAIJAN
TO
EITHER
BECOME
AZERIS
OR
LEAVE
AND
IT
ALSO
WILL
NOT
SUCCEED
AS
HAS
BEEN
DEMONSTRATED
KARABAKH
IRRESPECTIVE
OF
ITS
GEOGRAPHIC
POSITION
SITUATED
TECHNICALLY
WITHIN
THE
STALINPREPARED
BORDERS
OF
AZERBAIJAN
HAS
BEEN
LONG
OPPRESSED
AND
EVENTUALLY
WAS
INVADED
IN
BY
AZERI
OMON
AND
SOVIET
FORCES
RESULTING
IN
THE
NORTHERN
THIRD
OF
THIS
ARMENIAN
AREA
BEING
DEPOPULATED
OF
ARMENIANS
THE
ARMENIANS
HAVE
BEEN
FIGHTING
BACK
EVER
SINCE
CLEARLY
YOU
FEEL
IT
RATHER
RIDICULOUS
FOR
ARMENIANS
OF
LETS
SAY
GLENDALE
CALIFORNIA
TO
ENGAGE
IN
AN
INDEPENDENCE
MOVEMENT
FOR
A
FREE
AND
INDEPENDENT
GLENDALE
SIMILARLY
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
ARE
ENGAGING
IN
A
LOSING
ATTEMPT
AT
CLAIMING
SOVEREIGNTY
OVER
THE
LAND
AND
PEOPLE
OF
KARABAKH
WHO
HAVE
LIVED
CONTINUOUSLY
IN
KARABAKH
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
BEFORE
THE
FIRST
CENTRAL
ASIAN
INVADERS
EVER
STEPPED
FOOT
IN
THE
CAUCASUS
IC
SHOULD
THEY
GET
IT
IC
AND
SHOULD
THE
UN
ENFORCE
THEIR
WILL
IC
AND
IS
IT
A
SIMPLE
BEAUTIFUL
CONCEPT
INDEED
YOUR
ANALOGY
HAS
BROKEN
DOWN
BECAUSE
YOU
HAVE
SWITCHED
POSITIONS
OF
THE
VICTIM
AND
INVADER
A
BETTER
ANALOGY
WOULD
BE
THE
DIRECT
PARALLEL
BETWEEN
ARMENIANS
OF
KARABAKH
AND
NATIVE
AMERICANS
NOW
IF
YOU
WISH
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
THE
TENETS
OF
MIGHT
VERSUS
RIGHT
AND
THE
POLICIES
OF
SETTLER
