on
the
commemorative
anniversary
of
the
turkish
genocide
of
the
armenians
we
remember
those
whose
only
crime
was
to
be
armenian
in

an
emerging
turkish

the
turkish
government
began
a
systematically
executed
depopulation
of
the
eastern
anatolian
homeland
of
the
armenians
through
a
genocidal
extermination
this
genocide
was
to
insure
that
turks
exclusively
ruled
over
the
geographic
area
today
called
the
republic
of
turkey
the
result
million
murdered
billion
dollars
of
armenian
property
stolen
and
plundered
this
genocide
ended
nearly
years
of
armenian
civilization
on
those
lands
today
the
turkish
government
continues
to
scrape
clean
any
vestige
of
a
prior
armenian
existence
on
those
lands
todays
turkish
governmental
policy
is
to
rewrite
the
history
of
the
era
to
manufacture
distortion
and
generate
excuses
for
their
genocide
of
the
armenian
people
in
the
face
of
refutation
ad
nauseam
the
turkish
historical
society
and
cronies
shamelessly
continue
to
deny
that
any
such
genocide
occurred
this
policy
merely
demonstrates
that
in
the
modern
era
genocide
is
an
effective
state
policy
when
it
remains
unredressed
and
unpunished
a
crime
unpunished
is
