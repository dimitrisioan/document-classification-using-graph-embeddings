WHAT
ARE
THE
BORDERS
THE
ISLAMIC
WORLD
DREAMS
ABOUT
THE
ISLAMIC
WORLD
DREAMS
OF
BEING
THE
WHOLE
PLANET
BUT
NOT
BY
KICKING
THE
CURRENT
INHABITANT
OUT
WE
RATHER
DEAM
OF
THE
DAY
EVERYBODY
CONVERTS
IF
JEWS
HAD
THE
SAME
DREAM
I
WOULD
NOT
FEEL
THREATENED
A
BIT
CONTRARY
TO
WHAT
THE
PROTOCOLS
OF
ZION
CROWD
MIGHT
SUGGEST
JUDAISM
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ANY
SUCH
GOALS
ISLAMIC
READERS
I
AM
WAITING
TO
YOUR
HONEST
ANSWER
I
WANT
ALSO
A
HONEST
ANSWER
FROM
ZIONISTS
FOR
THE
FOLLOWING
QUESTIONS
DO
JEWS
WHO
DONT
EVEN
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
AS
IS
THE
CASE
WITH
MANY
OF
THE
FOUNDERS
OF
SECULAR
ZIONISM
HAVE
A
RIGHT
IN
PALESTINE
MORE
THAN
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
PALESTINE
JUST
BECAUSE
GOD
GAVE
YOU
THE
LAND
THE
QUESTION
YOU
ASK
IS
COMPLICATED
AND
DESERVES
AN
HONEST
ANSWER
I
AM
GOING
TO
PROVIDE
ONE
FROM
MY
OWN
CURRENT
PERSPECTIVE
NOT
A
HISTORICAL
ONE
CURRENTLY
AS
A
NONOBSERVANT
JEWISRAELIAMERICAN
MY
OWN
FEELING
IS
THAT
JEWS
FROM
THE
DIASPORA
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
GREATER
RIGHT
IN
PALESTINE
OR
ISRAEL
THAN
THE
PALESTINIANS
OR
ISRAELIS
BOTH
ARAB
AND
JEW
DO
WITH
REGARD
TO
JEWISH
ISRAELIS
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
THE
SAME
RIGHTS
IN
ISRAEL
AS
DO
ALL
OTHER
ISRAELIS
DO
MOST
OF
THEM
SPEAK
OF
THE
WEST
BANK
AS
THEIRS
WHILE
MOST
OF
THE
INHABITANTS
ARE
NOT
JEWS
AND
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
BE
PART
OF
ISRAEL
WHO
ARE
THEM
IF
BY
THEM
YOU
MEAN
THE
NONRELIGIOUS
JEWS
I
THINK
YOU
SHOULD
BE
AWARE
BY
NOW
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
SETTLERS
AND
THEIR
SUPPORTERS
ARE
RELIGIOUS
THE
OTHER
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IS
TO
MY
KNOWLEDGE
NOT
THAT
THE
PALESTINIANS
DONT
WANT
TO
BE
A
PART
OF
ISRAEL
AS
MUCH
AS
THEY
WOULD
ACCEPT
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
BEING
FULL
CITIZENS
OF
ISRAEL
WITH
ALL
THE
PRIVILIGES
AND
RESPONSIBILITIES
ACCORDED
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
WHAT
THEY
OBJECT
TO
IS
THE
CURRENT
LIMBO
