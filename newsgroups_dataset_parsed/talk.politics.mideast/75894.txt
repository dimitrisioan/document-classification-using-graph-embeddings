A
SHNEKENDORF
WRITES
WHAT
THE
HELL
DO
YOU
KNOW
ABOUT
ISRAELI
POLICY
WHAT
GIVES
YOU
THE
FIAT
TO
LOOK
INTO
THE
MINDS
OF
ISRAELI
GENERALS
HAS
THIS
POLICY
OF
INTIMIDATION
BEEN
PUBLISHED
SOMEWHERE
FOR
YOUR
INFORMATION
THE
ACTIONS
TAKEN
BY
ARABS
SPECIFICALLY
THE
PLO
WERE
NOT
UNCOMMON
IN
THE
LEBANON
CAMPAIGN
OF
MY
BRAIN
IS
FULL
OF
SHIT
AT
LEAST
I
DONT
LOOK
INTO
THE
MINDS
OF
OTHERS
AND
MAKE
ISRAELI
POLICY
FOR
THEM
DELETED
I
AM
NOT
IN
THE
BUSINESS
OF
READING
MINDS
HOWEVER
IN
THIS
CASE
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
NECESSARY
ISRAELIS
TOP
LEADERS
IN
THE
PAST
AND
PRESENT
ALWAYS
COME
ACROSS
AS
ARROGANT
WITH
THEIR
TOUGH
TALKS
TRYING
TO
INTIMIDATE
THE
ARABS
THE
WAY
I
SEE
IT
ISRAELIS
AND
ARABS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ACHIEVE
PEACE
AFTER
ALMOST
YEARS
OF
FIGHTING
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
TWO
MAJOR
REASONS
ARAB
GOVERNMENTS
ARE
NOT
REALLY
REPRESENTATIVE
OF
THEIR
PEOPLE
CURRENTLY
MOST
OF
THEIR
LEADERS
ARE
STUPID
ANDOR
NOT
INDEPENDENT
ANDOR
DICTATORS
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
IS
ARROGANT
AND
NONE
COMPRISING
