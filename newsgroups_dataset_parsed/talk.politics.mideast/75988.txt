I
HAVE
BEEN
CLOSELY
FOLLOWING
FOR
TWO
WEEKS
THE
WITHDRAWAL
OF
RUSSIANS
AND
ARMENIANS
FROM
TURKISH
TERRITORIES
THROUGH
ARMENIA
ALTHOUGH
TWO
MONTHS
HAVE
ELAPSED
SINCE
THE
CLEARING
OF
THE
TERRITORIES
OF
ARMENIAN
GANGS
I
HAVE
BEEN
OBSERVING
THE
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
CRUELTIES
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
AT
ALMOST
EVERY
STEP
ALL
THE
VILLAGES
FROM
TRABZON
TO
ERZINCAN
AND
FROM
ERZINCAN
TO
ERZURUM
ARE
DESTROYED
CORPSES
OF
TURKS
BRUTALLY
AND
CRUELLY
SLAIN
ARE
EVERYWHERE
ACCORDING
TO
ACCOUNTS
BY
THOSE
WHO
WERE
ABLE
TO
SAVE
THEIR
LIVES
BY
ESCAPING
TO
MOUNTAINS
THE
FIRST
HORRIBLE
AND
FEARFUL
EVENTS
BEGUN
WHEN
THE
RUSSIAN
FORCES
EVACUATED
THE
PLACES
WHICH
WERE
THEN
TAKEN
OVER
BY
ARMENIAN
GANGS
THE
RUSSIANS
USUALLY
TREATED
THE
PEOPLE
WELL
BUT
THE
PEOPLE
FEARED
THE
INTERVENTION
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
ONCE
THESE
PLACES
HAD
BEEN
TAKEN
OVER
BY
THE
ARMENIANS
HOWEVER
THE
MASSACRES
BEGUN
THEY
CLEARLY
ANNOUNCED
THEIR
INTENTION
OF
CLEARING
WHAT
THEY
CALLED
THE
ARMENIAN
AND
KURDISH
LAND
FROM
THE
TURKS
AND
THUS
SOLVE
THE
NATIONALITY
PROBLEM
TODAY
I
HAD
THE
OPPORTUNITY
TO
MEET
AUSTRIAN
AND
GERMAN
SOLDIERS
WHO
HAD
ESCAPED
FROM
RUSSIAN
PRISON
CAMPS
AND
COME
FROM
KARS
AND
ALEXANDER
PAUL
GUMRULENINAKANRUSSIAN
OFFICERS
TRIED
TO
SAVE
THE
TURKS
AND
THERE
WERE
CLASHES
BETWEEN
RUSSIAN
OFFICERS
AND
ARMENIAN
GANGS
I
AM
NOW
IN
ERZURUM
AND
WHAT
I
SEE
IS
TERRIBLE
ALMOST
THE
WHOLE
CITY
IS
DESTROYED
THE
SMELL
OF
THE
CORPSES
STILL
FILLS
THE
AIR
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
SPECULATIONS
THAT
ARMENIAN
GANGS
MURDERED
AUSTRIAN
AND
GERMAN
PRISONERS
AS
WELL
I
COULD
NOT
GET
THE
SUPPORTING
EVIDENCE
IN
THIS
REGARD
BUT
THERE
IS
PROOF
OF
MURDERING
OF
TURKISH
PRISONERS
OF

WE
CLOSED
THE
ROADS
AND

MIGHT
SERVE

FOR

PROCEEDED
