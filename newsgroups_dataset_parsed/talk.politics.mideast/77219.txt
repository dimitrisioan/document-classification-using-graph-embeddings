IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
BUT
I
HOPE
THE
ANSWER
IS
THAT
YOU
CANT
APPLY
UNDER
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
BY
CONVERSION
YOUVE
ELECTED
NOT
TO
BE
A
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
WHICH
WAS
MY
POINT
BY
CONVERTING
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
I
DO
NOT
LOOSE
MY
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
I
JUST
LOOSE
MY
RELIGIOUS
IDENTIFICATION
I
DISAGREE
BY
CONVERTING
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
YOU
CERTAINLY
DO
CHANGE
YOUR
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
AND
LOSE
THAT
PART
OF
YOU
WHICH
WAS
JEWISH
AT
THE
MOMENT
YOU
CONVERTED
YOU
OFFICIALLY
ANOUNCED
TO
THE
WORLD
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
YOURSELF
TO
BE
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
SO
WHY
SHOULD
THE
JEWISH
NATION
CONSIDER
YOU
TO
BE
A
MEMBER
TO
BE
A
PART
OR
NOT
OF
THE
JEISH
NATION
IS
DEFINED
BY
MY
CULTURE
AND
NOT
BY
MY
RELIGION
ACTUALLY
IF
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
WHICH
IS
IN
FACT
LIKE
CONVERTING
INTO
A
NONJEWISH
IN
TERMS
OF
RELIGION
I
AM
STILL
CONSIDERED
AS
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
NO
THERE
IS
A
SERIOUS
CULTURAL
AND
RELIGIOS
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
RENOUNCING
THE
JEWISH
GOD
AND
ACCEPTING
A
NEW
ONE
THOU
SHALL
HAVE
NO
OTHER
GODS
BEFORE
ME
CONVERSION
IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
THIS
ATHEISM
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
WIGGLE
AROUND
WITH
