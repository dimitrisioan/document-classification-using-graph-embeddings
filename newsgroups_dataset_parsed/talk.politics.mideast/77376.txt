re
rabin
and
his
palestinians
kapos
providing
safety
and
security
for
ones
own
people
is
the
most
fundamental
responsibility
of
any
political
entity
for
the
palestinian
leadership
to
refuse
to
accept
this
responsibility
ie
take
the
responsibility
to
protect
their
people
from
radical
palestinian
elements
who
are
opposed
to
the
peace
process
is
reprehensible
to
argue
that
a
palestinian
police
force
would
be
established
in
order
to
control
peaceful
political
groups
only
reinforces
the
reality
that
the
palestinian
leadership
so
far
can
not
exercise
control
over
radical
palestinian
elements
nor
effectively
deal
with
the
killing
of
palestinians
by
palestinians
this
is
a
problem
that
can
only
be
solved
by
the
palestinian
people
