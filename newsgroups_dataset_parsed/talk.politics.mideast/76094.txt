re
what
you
should
know
about
the
serbiangreek
connection
in

kiniklioglu
writes
first
of
all
i
have
to
reiterate
that
your
terminology
in
describing
the
events
of
are
extremely
misleading
cyprus
is
not
occupied
by
turkish
forces
it
was
invited
by
turkish
cypriots
and
intervened
ohi
seei
didnt
realize
this
i
think
that
perhaps
you
should
print
flyers
on
this
topic
and
your
reasons
for
thinking
the
way
you
do
you
should
then
distribute
them
amongst
the
worlds
population
you
see
i
dont
think
there
are
many
people
who
are
aware
of
this
fact
thank
you
for
telling
us
the
truth
btw
i
would
start
by
sending
your
flyers
to
each
of
the
un
officials
also
after
you
have
distributed
your
flyers
you
might
consider
hiding
you
see
i
think
that
once
more
people
read
what
you
think
they
will
have
to
lock
you
up
in
a
mental
institute
and
dont
think
they
will
ever
let
you
out
it
is
a
strange
strange
world
you
live
in
i
feel
sorry
for
you
