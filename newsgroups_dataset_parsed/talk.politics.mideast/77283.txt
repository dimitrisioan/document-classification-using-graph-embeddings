MORRISJAYCSYALEEDU
JAY
MORRIS
WRITES
I
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
ADMINISTRATION
IS
PLANNING
TO
POSITION
TROOPS
IN
MACEDONIA
ANY
REACTION
OUT
THERE
TO
THIS
MACEDONIA
SAID
YESTERDAY
IT
HAD
NEITHER
REQUESTED
OR
NEEDS
SUCH
FORCES
THIS
IS
SORT
OF
LIKE
SENDING
THE
NATIONAL
GUARD
TO
BEL
AIR
WHEN
THE
RIOT
IS
IN
SOUTH
CENTRAL
OBVIOUSLY
CLINTON
IS
AGAIN
TRYING
TO
MAKE
POLICY
FOR
IMAGE
PURPOSES
IN
AMERICA
RATHER
THAN
TO
TRY
TO
DEAL
WITH
THE
REAL
PROBLEM
AND
ASSUME
A
SHARE
OF
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THE
PROBLEM
HE
OBVIOUSLY
DIDNT
EVEN
CONSULT
WITH
THE
MACEDONIANSHE
WAS
JUST
LOOKING
AT
THE
MAP
OF
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
FOR
THE
SAFEST
PLACE
TO
PUT
AMERICAN
TROOPS
SO
HE
COULD
SAY
TO
THE
EUROPEANSHEY
LOOK
WE
HAVE
TROOPS
ON
THE
GROUND
IN
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
TOONOW
LET
ME
BOMB
SO
I
CAN
MAKE
IT
LOOK
LIKE
I
AM
DOING
SOMETHING
IN
THE
AMERICAN
MEDIA
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
BLUE
BERETS
IN
BOSNIA
ARE
DEAD
MEAT
IF
CLINTON
STARTS
BOMBING
BUT
CLINTON
DOESNT
HAVE
THE
COURAGE
TO
ASK
THAT
THE
BLUE
BERETS
LEAVE
BECAUSE
THEN
HE
BECOMES
PRIMARILY
RESPONSIBLE
TO
THE
BOSNIAN
POLICY
OF
THE
UN
AND
THE
ALLIES
CLINTON
WANTS
TO
HAVE
HIS
CAKE
AND
EAT
IT
TOOHE
WANTS
TO
FEEL
FREE
TO
USE
AMERICAN
MILITARY
POWER
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
DOMESTIC
US
POLITICS
AND
HIS
DOMESTIC
IMAGE
BUT
HE
DOESNT
WANT
TO
ASSUME
THE
PRIMARY
INTERNATIONAL
LEADERSHIP
ROLE
IN
THE
UN
AND
AMONG
THE
ALLIES
LIKE
BUSH
FOR
ALL
HIS
FAULTS
DID
IN
THE
GULF
WAR
BECAUSE
WITH
LEADERSHIP
COMES
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
CLINTON
SEEMS
TO
WANT
TO
RETAIN
THE
EUROPEANS
AS
SCAPEGOATS
CLINTON
WANTS
TO
LEAVE
THE
EUROPEANS
IN
CHARGE
AND
RESPONSIBLE
BUT
WANTS
TO
FREELANCE
ON
THE
SIDEAND
IF
HIS
FREELANCING
GETS
TOO
HOT
HE
WANTS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
CUT
AND
RUNTHE
AMERICAN
PUBLIC
MAY
BE
EASILY
