memoirs
of
an

officer
who
participated
in
the
genocide
of
million
muslim
people
but
as
you
point
out
so
often
there
is
no
use
arguing
with
easily
verified
facts
as
the
turks
had
solved
the
armenian
problem
in
turkey
by
slaying
or
driving
the
armenians
out
of
the
country
so
we
now
proceeded
to
solve
the
tartar
problem
in
armenia
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
tartars
and
then
proceeded
in
the
work

pp
it
seems
that
terrorism
against
their
own
conationals
has
been
a
prominent
part
of
the
revolutionary
activities
of
the
dashnag
leaders
of
the
caucasus
organized
to
fight
the
turks
these
chieftains
have
been
more
successful
in
their
fight
against
their
armenian
opponents
in
turkey
and
the
caucasus
very
often
defenseless
and
innocent
p
we
were
defeated
p
the
fact
remains
however
that
the
leaders
of
the
turkish
armenian
section
of
the
dashnagtzoutune
did
not
carry
out
their
promise
of
loyalty
to
the
turkish
cause
when
the
turks
entered
the
warand
a
call
was
sent
for
armenian
volunteers
to
fight
the
turks
on
the
caucasian
front
p
thousands
of
armenians
from
all
over
the
world
flocked
to
the
standards
of
such
famous
fighters
as
antranik
kery
dro
etc
the
armenian
volunteer
regiments
rendered
valuable
service
to
the
russian
army
in
the
years
of
by
the
way
here
is
the
entire
paragraph
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
tartars
and
then
proceeded
in
the
work
of
extermination
our
troops
surrounded
village
after
village
little
resistance
was
offered
our
artillery
knocked
the
huts
into
heaps
of
stone
and
dust
and
when
the
villages
became
untenable
and
inhabitants
fled
from
them
into
fields
bullets
and
bayonets
completed
the
work
some
of
the
tartars
escaped
of
course
they
found
refuge
in
the
mountains
or
succeeded
in
crossing
the
border
into
turkey
the
rest
were
killed
and
so
it
is
that
the
whole
length
of
the
borderland
of
russian
armenia
from
nakhitchevan
to
akhalkalaki
from
the
hot
plains
of
ararat
to
the
cold
mountain
plateau
of
the
north
were
dotted
with
mute
mournful
ruins
of
tartar
villages
they
are
quiet
now
those
villages
except
for
howling
of
wolves
and
jackals
that
visit
them
to
paw
over
the
scattered
bones
of
