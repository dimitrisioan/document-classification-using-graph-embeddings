IT
IS
NOT
A
QUESTION
OF
AN
INDIVIDUALS
STANDING
WHEN
A
PARTY
PUTS
UP
AN
ARAB
FOR
A
CABINET
POST
AND
THAT
ARAB
IS
REJECTED
BUT
THE
POSITION
IS
GIVEN
TO
A
JEW
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
WE
ARE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
POWER
BUT
RACISM
NOT
NECESSARILY
AS
SHAI
POINTS
OUT
POLITICAL
APPOINTMENTS
ARE
BASED
ON
POWER
THEY
ARE
ALSO
BASED
ON
FAVORS
OWED
COALITION
BUILDING
AND
DEAL
MAKING
ACTUALLY
I
AM
NOT
SURE
YOU
HAVE
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
I
HAVE
SAID
ON
SEVERAL
OCCASIONS
A
MINOR
PARTY
HAS
PUT
UP
AN
ARAB
FOR
A
CABINET
POSITION
THAT
IS
THE
MAJOR
PARTY
LABOUR
IN
THIS
CASE
HAS
AGREED
THAT
A
MINOR
PARTY
CAN
HAVE
SO
MANY
SEATS
AND
THAT
PARTY
NOMINATES
AN
ARAB
FOR
ONE
THIS
IS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
TO
THE
MAJOR
PARTY
WHICH
INSISTS
ON
THE
MINOR
PARTY
APPOINTING
A
JEW
THE
FAVOURS
OWED
DEALS
DONE
HAVE
ALL
BEEN
SETTLED
WHAT
REMAINS
IS
EXACTLY
WHO
IS
GOING
TO
SIT
IN
CABINET
THE
PARTY
THAT
GETS
THE
SEAT
WANTS
AN
ARAB
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
THIS
IS
RACISM
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
POLITICS

ALL
