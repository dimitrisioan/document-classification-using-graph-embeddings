THE

GENOCIDE
OF
MILLION

PEOPLE
BULL
P
SECOND
PARAGRAPH
I
HAD
RECEIVED
FURTHER
VERY
DEFINITE
INFORMATION
OF
HORRORS
THAT
HAD
BEEN
COMMITTED
BY
THE
ARMENIAN
SOLDIERY
IN
KARS
PLAIN
AND
AS
I
HAD
BEEN
ABLE
TO
JUDGE
OF
THEIR
WANT
OF
DISCIPLINE
BY
THEIR
TREATMENT
OF
MY
OWN
DETACHED
PARTIES
I
HAD
WIRED
TO
TIFLIS
FROM
ZIVIN
THAT
IN
THE
INTERESTS
OF
HUMANITY
THE
ARMENIANS
SHOULD
NOT
BE
LEFT
IN
INDEPENDENT
COMMAND
OF
THE
MOSLEM
POPULATION
AS
THEIR
TROOPS
BEING
WITHOUT
DISCIPLINE
AND
NOT
UNDER
EFFECTIVE
CONTROL
ATROCITIES
WERE
CONSTANTLY
BEING
COMMITTED
FOR
WHICH
WE
SHOULD
WITH
JUSTICE
EVENTUALLY
BE
HELD
TO
BE
MORALLY
RESPONSIBLE
ON

FIND

FACSIMILE

NEAR

DISPOSAL
FOR
OUR
JOURNEY
I
FORESAW
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
BECOME
OUR
HEADQUARTERS
FOR
A
CONSIDERABLE
TIME
AND
THEREFORE
WENT
TO
SOME
TROUBLE
TO
MAKE
IT
HABITABLE
WE
HAD
A
MOST
PECULIAR
LITTLE
LOCOMOTIVE
ORIGINALLY
BUILT
IN
AMERICA
FOR
THE
RUSSIAN
GOVERNMENT
ADAPTED
TO
BURN
EITHER
WOOD
OR
OIL
ONE
COVERED
TRUCK
AS
MENS
QUARTERS
ONE
SIMILAR
WHICH
I
FITTED
UP
FOR
MY
SELF
AND
A
RAILWAY
OFFICER
AND
ALSO
A
TRUCK
TO
CARRY
WOOD
THREE
CARS
BEING
THE
UTMOST
OUR
SMALL
ENGINE
COULD
PULL
WITH
THIS
SMALL
OUTFIT
WE
STARTED
RUMOURS
OF
ALL
KINDS
REACHING
US
BEFORE
OUR
DEPARTURE
INDICATING
THAT
THE
WHOLE
SITUATION
WAS
RAPIDLY
COMING
TO
A
HEAD
IT
BEING
EVIDENT
THAT
THE
TURKS
WERE
BECOMING
MORE
AND
MORE
RESTIVE
IN
THE
FACE
OF
THE
INEXPLICABLE
DELAY
OF
THE
ALLIES
IN
REACHING
ANY
DEFINITE
DECISION
WITH
REGARD
TO
THE
FUTURE
TRAVELLING
ON
THIS
LITTLE
WARTIME
RAILWAY
WAS
INDEED
AN
EXPERIENCE
AND
IT
WAS
NECESSARY
TO
CARRY
A
GAUGE
AND
TO
TEST
THE
RAILS
WITH
IT
FREQUENTLY
FOR
IN
MANY
PLACES
OWING
TO
THE
SINKING
OF
THE
EMBANKMENTS
AND
THE
WASHING
AWAY
OF
THE
BALLAST
THE
RAILS
REQUIRED
RECTIFICATION
BEFORE
WE
WERE
ABLE
TO
GET
OUR
TRAIN
OVER
EVEN
AT
A
FOOT
PACE
EACH
BRIDGE
ALSO
RE
QUIRED
ELABORATE
EXAMINATION
BEFORE
ADVENTURING
THE
TRAIN
UPON
IT
AND
EVENTUALLY
WE
WERE
OBLIGED
TO
CARRY
LARGE
BAULKS
OF
TIM
BER
TO
TEMPORARILY
SHORE
UP
MANY
OF
THE
BRIDGES
AND
CULVERTS
WHILST
WE
PASSED
OVER
THEM
UNDER
THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES
IT
MAY
BE
IMAGINED
THAT
OUR
PROG
RESS
WAS
BY
NO
MEANS
RAPID
AND
AS
WE
HAD
FREQUENTLY
TO
HALT
ALSO
TO
REPLENISH
OUR
SUPPLY
OF
WOOD
FUEL
WE
CONSIDERED
WE
HAD
ACHIEVED
WONDERS
WHEN
ON
THE
EVENING
OF
THE
SECOND
DAY
HOURS
AND
MILES
OUT
FROM
ERZEROUM
WE
FINALLY
ENTERED
THE
GORGE
OF
THE
MOUNTAINS
WHERE
WE
UNDERSTOOD
OUR
WORST
TROUBLES
TO
LIE
THIS
IS
THE
SAME
GORGE
INTO
WHICH
THE
ROAD
FROM
ERZEROUM
TO
KARS
DESCENDS
FROM
THE
FOOTHILLS
TO
CROSS
THE
FRONTIER
THE
RAILWAY
HOWEVER
FOLLOWS
THE
MAIN
ARAS
RIVER
VAL
LEY
TILL
THE
FRONTIER
GORGE
ENTERS
IT
WHILST
THE
ROAD
CUTS
OFF
THE
CORNER
AND
JOINS
THE
RAIL
AGAIN
AT
THE
FRONTIER
POST
OF
ZIVIN
SOME
MILES
FROM
THE
MAIN
VALLEY
SOON
AFTER
ENTERING
THE
GORGE
WE
WERE
CONFRONTED
BY
THE
FIRST
SERIOUS
FALL
OF
ROCKABOUT
TONS
HAVING
FALLEN
FROM
THE
CLIFF
FACE
AND
ENTIRELY
OBLITERATED
THE
