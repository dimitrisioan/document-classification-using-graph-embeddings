the
nazi
racial
theory
only
brendan
mckay
or
maybe
arf
would
come
to
the
rescue
of
nazi
racial
theory
is
it
distressing
brendan
the
point
is
that
any
eugenic
solution
to
the
jewish
problem
as
elias
has
proposed
smacks
of
pure
nazism
the
fact
that
elias
proposal
cast
the
entire
problem
as
one
of
the
abnormal
presence
of
israeli
society
in
the
middle
east
and
that
he
buried
a
slam
against
us
aid
to
israel
in
the
midst
of
his
evenhanded
solution
of
the
jewish
question
made
it
obvious
what
he
had
in
mind
disolving
the
jewish
polity
that
is
a
nazi
doctrine
rectification
of
the
abnormal
presence
of
the
jewish
people
within
a
larger
body
politic
whether
your
solution
involves
gas
monetary
incentives
to
the
poor
jews
to
marry
out
or
as
feisal
husseini
has
said
disolve
the
zionist
entity
by
forcing
it
to
engage
the
normal
surrounding
arab
culture
you
are
engaged
in
a
nazi
project
just
as
obvious
is
your
statement
i
will
not
comment
on
the
value
or
lack
of
value
of
eliass
proposal
still
striking
the
glancing
blow
right
brendan
you
could
easily
see
where
he
was
going
but
you
will
not
comment
so
you
are
complicitous
what
is
your
fascination
with
nazi
racial
theory
anyway

someone

in

brendan
d
mckay
writes
a
unconventional
proposal
for
peace
in
the
middleeast
by
elias
davidsson
the
emergence
of
a
considerable
number
of
mixed
marriages
in
israelpalestine
all
of
whom
would
have
relatives
on
both
sides
of
the
divide
would
make
the
conflict
lose
its
ethnical
and
unsoluble
core
and
strengthen
the
emergence
of
a
truly
civil
society
the
existence
of
a
strong
mixed
stock
of
people
would
also
help
the
integration
of
israeli
society
into
the
sounds
just
like
a
racial
theory
that
hitler
outlined
in
mein
kampf
someone
else
said
something
similar
i
will
not
comment
on
the
value
or
lack
of
value
of
eliass
proposal
i
just
want
to
say
that
it
is
very
distressing
that
at
least
two
people
here
are
profoundly
ignorant
of
nazi
racial
doctrine
they
were
not
like
eliass
idea
they
were
more
like
the
opposite
nazis
believed
in
racial
purity
not
racial
assimilation
an
instructive
example
is
the
nazi
attitude
to
gypsies
according
to
nazi
theoreticians
gypsies
were
an
aryan
race
they
were
persecuted
and
in
huge
numbers
murdered
because
most
european
gypies
were
considered
not
pure
gypsies
but
mongrels
formed
from
the
pure
gypsy
race
and
other
undesirable
races
this
was
the
key
difference
between
the
theoretical
approach
to
jews
and
gypsies
by
the
way
it
is
also
true
that
towards
the
end
of
wwii
even
the
purist
gypsies
were
hunted
down
as
the
theory
was
forgotten
