RE
DEIR
YASSIN
HMCSBROWNEDU
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
GET
THEE
TO
A
NUNNERY
WRITES
THIS
IS
SUCH
BULLSHIT
DEIR
YASSIN
WAS
AN
UNPROVOKED
ATTACK
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
JEWS
AND
A
MASSACRE
DEFINES
IT
BEST
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
VILLAGE
OF
DEIR
YASSIN
HAD
HAD
A
PACT
WITH
THE
JEWS
A
PEACE
PACT
BUT
THE
IRGUN
PURPOSELY
BROKE
THIS
AGREEMENT
IN
ORDER
TO
SCARE
OFF
THE
PALESTINIANS
I
MIGHT
GRANT
THAT
THIS
VILLAGE
HOUSED
ARMED
ARABS
I
DOUBT
IT
BUT
NOTHING
IN
THE
ARCHIVES
AND
AVAILABLE
LITERATURE
INDICATES
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
MOTIVATING
FORCE
AMONGST
THE
IRGUN
THE
DEIR
YASSIN
MASSACRE
WAS
PART
OF
AN
OVER
ALL
STRATEGY
TO
INTIMIDATE
THE
PALESTINIANS
TO
FLEE
THE
JEWISH
HOMELANDAND
CONTRARY
TO
YOUR
BELIEF
MANY
CIVILIANS
WERE
KILLED
DEIR
YASSIN
WAS
LATER
ADVERTIZED
BY
THE
VERY
JEWS
WHO
PERPETRATED
IT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
USEFUL
IN
GETTING
MANY
PALESTINIANS
TO
LEAVE
THE
PALESTINIANS
WERE
RIGHTFULLY
SCARED
OFF
BECAUSE
THEY
DID
NOT
WANT
ANOTHER
DEIR
YASSIN
IM
NOT
NECESSARILY
CONDEMNING
THE
ISRAELITES
HERE
ATROCITIES
WERE
ASLO
COMMITTED
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
ARABS
ISRAELOPHILES
SHOULD
JUST
BE
CAREFUL
IN
THINKING
THAT
THEY
ARE
AND
WERE
THE
GOOD
GUYS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
BOTH
ARAB
AND
JEW
SUCK
EQUALLY
YOU
SAY
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
THAT
WHAT
MOTIVATED
THE
IRGUN
TO
ATTACK
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
ITS
STRATEGIC
IMPORTANCE
IN
FACT
BEGIN
WHO
WAS
IN
CHARGE
OF
THE
IRGUN
WROTE
THAT
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
ATTACKED
FOR
ITS
MILITARY
SIGNIFICANCE
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
MERELY
A
BATTLE
IN
THE
WAR
OF
LIBERATION
PEOPLE
DIED
BUT
THE
THING
WAS
NEVER
INTENDED
TO
BE
A
MASACRE
THAT
THIS
HAPENNED
IS
A
TRAGEDY
OF
WAR
NOT
A
CRIME
OF
THE
IRGUN
HARRY
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HARRY
HOWEVER
YOU
MUST
ALSO
CONCEDE
THEN
THAT
ARAB
TERRORISM
IS
ALSO
A
TRAGEDY
OF
WAR
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
PALESTINIANS
HAVE
NO
OTHER
EFFECTIVE
TARGET
BUT
CIVILIANS
IN
ORDER
TO
FURTHER
THEIR
CAUSE
IF
IRGUN
HAD
TO
ATTACK
CIVILIAN
TARGETS
TO
TERRORIZE
IN
ORDER
THAT
THEY
MIGHT
OBTAIN
SOME
OBJECTIVE
IM
SURE
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
SO
I
ALSO
DONT
EXCLUDE
IRGUNS
ACTION
AGAINST
BRITISH
SOLDIERS
AS
TERRORISM
THE
BRITISH
WERE
SHOWING
SIGNS
OF
FAVORING
A
COMPROMISE
WITH
REGARDS
TO
PALESTINE
AND
THE
IRGUN
AND
BRANCH
OFF
GROUPS
MADE
A
POINT
TO
KILL
YOUNG
BRITISH
RECRUITS
SO
THAT
MOTHERS
AND
FATHERS
BACK
IN
BRITAIN
WOULD
GET
ANGRY
AT
BRITAINS
CONTINUED
PRESENCE
IN
PALESTINE
SOUNDS
LIKE
A
FORM
OF
TERRORISM
TO
ME
AND
NOT
MUCH
REMOVED
FROM
ARAB
TERRORISM
WE
MUST
NOT
ALSO
FORGET
THAT
IRGUN
OR
IRGUN
BRANCH
OFF
GROUPS
MORE
LIKELY
KILLED
MANY
JEWS
WHO
WERE
NOT
AS
HARDLINE
ZIONIST
AS
THEY
OR
WHO
COOPERATED
WITH
THE
BRITISH
ILL
REITERATE
AGAIN
BOTH
SIDES
ARE
SCREWY
BUT
ILL
FAVOR
THE
UNDERDOG
IN
THIS
CASE
BECAUSE
I
DO
THINK
THEY
WERE
A
BIT
SCREWED
