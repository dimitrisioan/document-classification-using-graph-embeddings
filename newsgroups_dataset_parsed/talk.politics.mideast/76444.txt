re
uva
a
few
things
about
the
university
it
is
more
fun
than
some
may
admit
partying
does
go
on
and
it
has
consistently
been
ranked
one
of
playboys
top
party
schools
but
we
do
study
and
more
importantly
learn
a
lot
the
overall
uva
drug
use
is
actually
lower
than
the
average
college
in
the
us
there
is
no
hate
law
on
the
books
even
though
they
the
forces
of
pc
tried
to
have
one
last
year
by
the
way
a
similar
law
at
the
university
of
wisconsin
was
found
unconstitutional
last
year
there
is
a
law
against
relationship
of
professors
with
their
students
or
advisees
that
just
passed
thomas
jefferson
was
the
sole
author
of
the
virginia
statute
for
religious
freedomthe
basis
for
the
first
ten
amendments
though
he
is
not
given
full
credit
for
righting
the
bill
of
rights
so
someone
who
picked
on
me
for
that
is
right
by
the
way
were
the
man
in
everything
sports
academics
and
partying
im
sure
a
lot
of
other
schools
are
good
at
what
they
do
as
well
so
dont
start
mailing
me
junk
im
happy
where
i
am
and
maybe
ill
go
to
one
of
yalls
medical
schools
in
a
couple
of
years
