HADASHOR
PUBLISHED
THE
ITEM
ABOUT
THE
DYING
JEWS
AFTER
VIEWING
A
VIDEO
TAPE
FILMED
LAST
WEEK
IN

HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
ACTUALLY
CONVERTS
TO
CHRITIANITY
IF
THERE
ARE
JEWS
ON
THE
TAPE
THEN
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
SAY
I
AM
SPEAKING
FROM
EXPERIENCE
WHEN
I
SAY
THAT
THOSE
WHO
REMAINED
IN
ETHIOPIA
ARE
CHRISTIANS
I
KNOW
THAT
THERE
HAVE
PREVIOUSLY
BEEN
THINGS
PUBLISHED
IN
THE

BY
INTERESTING
PARTIES
AND
THERE
IS
NO
CONNECTION
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
REALITY
WHAT

ETHIOPIAN
IMMIGRANTS

WANT
THEIR

TO
YOU
RECOMMEND
THAT
ETHIOPIAN
CHILDREN
IN
ISRAEL
DO
WHEN
THEIR
PARENTS
AND
THE
REST
OF
THEIR
RELATIVES
REMAIN
IN
ETHIOPIA
I
ASK
IF
IT
IS
THE
JOB
OF
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
TO
BRING
IN
THE
RELATIVES
WHO
STAYED
IN
ETHIOPIA
WELL
MY
ANSWER
IS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
IT
WOULD
BE
A
BETTER
SOLUTION
ECONOMICALLY
AS
WELL
FOR
THAT
YOUNG
MAN
TO
BUY
A
ONEWAY
TICKET
TO
ETHIOPIA

REUNITE
