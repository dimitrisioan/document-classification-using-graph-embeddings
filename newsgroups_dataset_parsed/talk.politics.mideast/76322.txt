eh
could
you
please
give
me
details
about
an
event
where
a
neutral
observer
was
killed
by
purpose
by
an
israeli
soldier
actually
im
still
trying
to
understand
the
selfjustifying
rationale
behind
the
recent
murder
of
ian
feinberg
in
gaza
hate
to
be
simple
minded
about
this
tim
but
i
think
its
really
very
simple
he
was
a
dirty
jew
and
the
only
good
jew
in
some
peoples
mind
is
a
dead
jew
thats
what
years
of
propaganda
that
fails
to
discriminate
between
jew
and
zionist
will
do
thats
what
years
of
statements
like
the
ones
ive
appended
will
do
to
someones
mind
they
make
people
sick
they
drag
down
political
discourse
to
the
point
where
killing
your
opponent
is
an
honorable
way
to
resolve
a
dispute
what
else
can
come
of
such
demagogery

any
palestinian
leader
who
suggests
ending
the

exposes
himself
to
the
bullets
of
his
own
people
and
endangers
his
life
the
plo
will
know
how
to
deal

open

be
they
from

soviet
union
ethiopia
or
anywhere
else
it
would
be
a
disgrace
if
we
did
not
lift
a
finger
while
herds
of
immigrants
settle
our
territory
i
want
you
to
shoot
it
makes
no
difference
if
they
live
in

i
give
you
explicit

open
