QUESTION
DO
COME
TO

CONCERNING
THE
SUCCESS
WE
ALL
HOPE
FOR
IN

THESE

CERTAINLY
SEEM
TO

ESSENTIALLY

REJECTION
OF
ANY

SELFCONTROL
WITHOUT

TO

AND

LATER

MORE
RELAXED

PERIOD
HOW
SHOULD
PROPOSALS

ALTERED

TEMPER
THEIR
MAXIMALIST
APPROACHES
AS
STATED
ABOVE
HOW
CAN
ISRAELI
WORRIES
AND
DESIRE
FOR
SOME
INTERIM
CONTROL
BE
ADDRESSED
WHILE
PROVIDING
FOR
A
VERY
REAL
INTERIM
PALESTINIAN
SELFGOVERNING
ENTITY
TIM
LATER
COMMENT
THERE
SEEM
TO
BE
TWO
PERCEPTIONS
THAT
HAVE
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
THE
FIRST
IS
THAT
OF
ISRAEL
WHERE
THERE
IS
LITTLE
TRUST
FOR
ARAB
GROUPS
SO
THERE
IS
LITTLE
SUPPORT
FOR
ISRAEL
GIVING
UP
TANGIBLE
ASSETS
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
PIECES
OF
PAPER
EXPECTATIONS
HOPES
ETC
THE
SECOND
IS
THAT
OF
THE
ARAB
WORLDPALESTINIANS
WHERE
THERE
IS
THE
DEMAND
THAT
THESE
TANGIBLE
CONCESSIONS
BE
MADE
BY
ISRAEL
WITHOUT
IT
RECEIVING
ANYTHING
TANGIBLE
BACK
GIVEN
THIS
THE
GAP
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
STANCES
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
NEED
BY
ISRAEL
OF
RECEIVING
SOME
TANGIBLE
RETURNS
FOR
ITS
EXPECTED
CONCESSIONS
BY
TANGIBLE
IS
MEANT
SOMETHING
THAT
PROVIDES
ISRAEL
WITH
COMPARABLE
PROTECTION
FROM
THE
LAND
IT
IS
TO
GIVE
UP
IN
SOME
WAY
ENSURES
THAT
THE
ARAB
STATES
AND
PALESTINE
WILL
BE
ACCOUNTABLE
AND
HELD
ACTIVELY
NOT
JUST
DIPLOMATICALLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
UPHOLDING
OF
ALL
ACTIONS
ON
ITS
TERRITORY
BY
CITIZENS
OR
VISITORS
ISRAEL
IS
HANGING
ON
LARGELY
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SCARED
STIFF
THAT
THE
MINUTE
IT
LETS
GO
GIVES
LANDS
BACK
TO
ARAB
STATES
NO
MORE
BUFFER
ZONE
GIVES
FULL
AUTONOMY
TO
PALESTINIANS
ANY
ANDOR
ALL
OF
THE
ARAB
PARTIES
COULD
AND
WOULD
IF
NOT
CONTROLLED
SOMEHOW
EASILY
RETURN
TO
THE
TRADITIONAL
ANTIISRAEL
POSITION
THE
QUESTION
THEN
IS
HOW
TO
REALLY
ENSURE
THAT
THAT

NOT
HAPPEN
