GREAT
SOMEONE

POSTING
FROM
PROTOCOLS
OF
THE

OF

NEXT
UNLIKE
THE
PLOS
ALMOST
EXCLUSIVE
FOCUS
ON
CIVILIAN
TARGETS
AT
THIS
TIME
THE
PLO
DID
NOT
EXIST
AND
WOULD
NOT
FOR
THE
NEXT
YEARS
YOU
KNEW
THAT
DIDNT
YOU
PERHAPS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
ADD
UP
ALL
THE
JEWISH
CIVILIANS
KILLED
DURING
THE
WAR
ILL
OPT
FOR
THE
MASSACRE
AT
DEIR
YASSIN
WHICH
DO
YOU
THINK
IS
THE
GREATER
IN
HOWEVER
ERIC
SILVER
OF
THE
GUARDIAN
BRITAIN
INTERVIEWED
A
SURVIVOR
MOPHAMMED
SAMMOUR
WHO
TESTIFIED
THAT
OUT
OF
A
POPULATION
OF
WERE
KILLED
WHILE
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
THIS
MAN
I
HAVE
INCLUDED
MORE
OF
HIS
TESTIMONY
THAT
HARRY
NATURALLY
DOES
NOT
USE
NOR
DOES
MYTHS
AND
FACTS
I
WONDER
WHY
NO
DOUBT
HE
WAS
LYING
RIGHT
HARRY
THE
REASON
WAS
MAINLY
ECONOMIC
THAT
IS
TO
CAPTURE
BOOTY
IN
ORDER
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
BASES
WHICH
WE
HAD
THEN
ESTABLISHED
WITH
VERY
POOR
RESOURCES
THE
MAIN
IDEA
DESPITE
THIS
REMAINED
THE
CONQUEST
OF
THE
VILLAGE
BY
FORCE
OF
ARMS
SOMETHING
WHICH
WAS
THEN
UNKNOWN
IN
THE
COUNTRY
AND
BECAME
A
TURNING
POINT
IN
JEWISH
MILITARY
OPERATIONS
YEHUDA

TESTIMONY
APART
FROM
THE
MILITARY
DISCUSSION
THE
LEHI
PUT
FORWARD
A
PROPOSAL
TO
LIQUI
DATE
THE
RESIDENTS
OF
THE
VILLAGE
AFTER
THE
CONQUEST
IN
ORDER
TO
SHOW
THE
ARABS
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
THE
IZL
AND
THE
LEHI
SET
OUT
TOGETHER
ON
AN
OPERATION
AND
FOR
ANOTHER
MAIN
REASON
IT
WOULD
CAUSE
A
GREAT
UPROAR
THROUGHOUT
THE
LAND
AND
WOULD
BE
AN
IMPORTANT
TURNING
POINT
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THE
BATTLES
THE
CLEAR
AIM
WAS
TO
BREAK
THE
ARAB
MORALE
AND
RAISE
SOMEWHAT
THE
MORALE
OF
THE
JEWISH
COMMU
NITY
IN
JERUSALEM
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
HIT
HARD
TIME
AFTER
TIME
ESPECIALLY
RECENCTLY
BY
THE
DESECRATION
OF
JEWISH
BODIES
WHICH
FELL
INTO
ARAB
HANDS

SO
IT
WASNT
LIKE
THE
HOLOCAUST
MORE
LIKE
LIDICE
A
WARNING
A
PUNISHMENT
COLLECTIVE
AND
INFLICTED
ON
UNARMED
INNOCENTS
JUST
NOT
AS
THROUGH
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
PRISONERS
OLD
PEOPLE
AND
CHILDREN
THERE
WERE
DIFFERENCES
OF
OPINION
BUT
THE
MAJORITY
WAS
FOR
LIQUIDATION
OF
ALL
THE
MEN
IN
THE
VILLAGE
AND
ANY
OTHER
FORCE
THAT
OPPOSED
US
WHETHER
IT
BE
OLD
PEOPLE

JAT
LET
ME
PUT
IN
SOME
WORDS
HERE
A
PREMEDITATED
B
MURDER
WHAT
DO
YOU
SAY
ABOUT
THE
EYEWITNESS
TESTIMONY
OF
THE
MAN
IN
COMMAND
WE
HAD
PRISONERS
AND
BEFORE
THE
RETREAT
WE
DECIDED
TO
LIQUIDATE
THEM
WE
ALSO
LIQUIDATED
THE
WOUNDED
AS
ANYWAY
WE
COULD
NOT
GIVE
THEM
FIRST
AID
IN
ONE
PLACE
ABOUT
EIGHTY
ARAB
PRISONERS
WERE
KILLED
AFTER
SOME
OF
THEM
HAD
OPENED
FIRE
AND
KILLED
ONE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
CAME
TO
GIVE
THEM
FIRST
AID
ARABS
WHO
DRESSED
UP
AS
ARAB
WOMEN
WERE
ALSO
FOUND
AND
SO
THEY
STARTED
TO
SHOOT
THE
WOMEN
ALSO
WHO
DID
NOT
HURRY
TO
THE
AREA
WHERE
THE
PRISONERS
WERE
CONCENTRATED
JAT
SHOOTING
PRISONERS
THE
WOUNDED

A
WARNING

FAMILIAR

ME
