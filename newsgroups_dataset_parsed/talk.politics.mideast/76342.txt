DRIVING
THE
JEWS
INTO
THE
SEA
I
AM
SICK
AND
TIRED
OF
THIS
DRIVING
THE
JEWS
INTO
THE
SEA
SENTANCE
ATTRIBUTED
TO
ISLAMIC
MOVEMENTS
AND
THE
PLO
IT
SIMPLY
CANT
BE
PROVEN
AS
PART
OF
THEIR
PLAN
PROVEN
MAYBE
NOT
BUT
IT
CAN
CERTAINLY
BE
VERIFIED
BEYOND
A
REASONABLE
DOUBT
THIS
STATEMENT
AND
STATEMENTS
LIKE
IT
ARE
A
MATTER
OF
PUBLIC
RECORD
BEFORE
THE
SIX
DAY
WAR
I
THINK
NASSER
AND
SOME
OTHER
ARAB
LEADERS
WERE
BROADCASTING
THESE
STATEMENTS
ON
ARAB
RADIO
YOU
MIGHT

AHMED
WHAT
HAMAS
AND
ISLAMIC
JIHAD
BELIEVE
IN
AS
FAR
AS
I
CAN
GET
FROM
THE
ARAB
MEDIA
IS
AN
ISLAMIC
STATE
THAT
PROTECTS
THE
RIGHTS
OF
ALL
ITS
INHABITANTS
UNDER
KORANIC
LAW
I
THINK
IF
YOU
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
HAMAS
COVENANT
WRITTEN
IN
YOU
MIGHT
GET
A
DIFFERENT
IMPRESSION
I
HAVE
THE
CONVENANT
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
ARABIC
WITH
A
TRANSLATION
THAT
IVE
VERIFIED
WITH
ARABIC
SPEAKERS
THE
DOCUMENT
IS
RIFE
WITH
CALLS
TO
KILL
JEWS
AND
SPREAD
ISLAM
AND
SO
FORTH
