I
AM
NOT
AWARE
OF
ANY
SUCH
INCIDENTS
I
HAVE
ASKED
YOU
TO
DOCUMENT
YOUR
ACCUSATION
I
REPEAT
MY
REQUEST
NAY
DEMAND
THAT
YOU
EITHER
SUBSTANTIATE
YOUR
ACCUSATION
OR
ELSE
DESIST
FROM
SPEWING
MORE
BASELESS

WRITES
IVE
READ
MOST
OF
THE
HISTORY
BOOKS
DEALING
WITH
THIS
PERIOD
GOOD
AND
BAD
AND
WHILE
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
I
MISSED
ONE
OR
TWO
NONE
OF
THOSE
IVE
READ
DOCUMENTS
ANY
RAZING
OF
MOSQUES
SO
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
REMARKABLE
CLAIM
REQUIRES
SPECIFIC
DOCUMENTATION
JAKE
DISRESPECTFULLY
DEMANDS
AND
ADAM
REQUIRES
SPECIFIC
DOCUMENTATION
OF
THE
RAZING
OF
MOSQUES
IN
JERUSALEM
IF
EITHER
OF
THEM
HAD
BEEN
READING
TPM
FOR
A
WHILE
THEY
WOULD
ALREADY
HAVE
SEEN
SUCH
DOCUMENTATION
FOR
THE
FORGETFUL
OR
NEWCOMERS
HOWEVER
HERE
ARE
THE
REFERENCES
WELL
IVE
BEEN
READING
TPM
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
HERE
IS
WHAT
I
SAW
YOU
WRITE
IN
ARTICLE
YOU
WROTE
FOR
BALANCE
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULD
MENTION
THE
MOSQUES
IN
JERUSALEM
THAT
WERE
RAZED
AFTER
THE
ISRAELI
VICTORY
IN
AN
EYE
FOR
AN
EYE
I
GUESS
YOUR
STATMENT
CLEARLY
TRIES
TO
BALANCE
ARAB
ATROCITIES
BY
NOTING
A
SINGLE
INCIDENT
BY
THE
ISRAELIS
IN
WARTIME
AT
THEIR
MOST
HOLY
SITE
YOU
EVEN
CHARACTERIZE
IT
AS
AN
EYE
FOR
AN
EYE
YOU
ALSO
WROTE
THAT
WOULD
BE
FALSE
IF
YOU
READ
YOUR
HISTORY
YOU
WILL
LEARN
THAT
RIGHT
AFTER
THE
WAR
THE
VICTORIOUS
ISRAELIS
DECIDED
TO
RAZE
A
SECTION
OF
THE
NEWLY
CAPTURED
EAST
JERUSALEM
NEAR
THE
WAILING
WALL
IT
IS
IN
THIS
SECTION
THAT
MOSQUES
WERE
RAZED
SO
NOW
YOU
HAVE
TO
FIND
SOME
SOURCE
THAT
NOTES
THAT
MORE
THAN
MOSQUE
WAS
RAZED
YOU
THEN
FOLLOWED
IT
WITH
THIS
EPISODE
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
GOOD
GOVERNMENT
RUNNING
AMOK
WITH
NEWLY
ACQUIRED
POWER
REALLY
DO
YOU
STILL
FEEL
THAT
ISRAELIS
ARE
COMPARABLE
IN
THE
RUNNING
AMOK
WITH
POWER
WITH
SAY
THE
IRAQIS
YOUR
EYE
FOR
AN
EYE
COMPARISONS
DONT
MATCH
THE
REALITIES
THAT
MOST
OF
US
ARE
FAMILIAR
WITH
QUOTING
FROM
THE
WEST
BANK
STORY
PAGES
ON
THE
NIGHT
OF
JUNE
AN
ISRAELI
OFFICER
MARCHED
FROM
DOOR
TO
DOOR
THIS
HAPPENED
TO
BE
DURING
A
WAR
AND
A
FIERCE
AND
MIGHTY
WAR
IT
WAS
TOO
WOULD
YOU
SAY
THAT
THE
JORDANIANS
INDISCRIMINATELY
SHOT
UP
ANCIENT
STRUCTURES
AS
IS
THEIR
CUSTOM
IN
DESCRIBING
BULLET
HOLES
IN
THE
WALLS
OF
THE
CITY
THIS
WAS
WAR
IT
WAS
CERTAINLY
NOT
ANY
EYE
FOR
AN
EYE
CHARACTERSTIC
ISRAELIS
DO
NOT
HARBOR
THE
SAME
FEELINGS
OF
REVENGE
AS
THE
ARABS
GENERALLY
DO
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
THAT
THE
PEACE
NOW
MOVEMENT
EXISTS
IN
ISRAEL
AND
NOWHERE
ELSE
IN
THE
ME
