WRITES
THERE
ARE
ARABS
IN
CABINET
BUT
LOOK
HOW
LONG
IT
TOOK
AND
TO
WHAT
INSIGNIFICANT
POSITIONS
THEY
ARE
ASSIGNED
AND
THIS
IS
BASED
SOLELY
ON
RACE
NOT
POLITICAL
BELIEF
OR
SECURITY
AS
JEWISH
MEMBERS
OF
THE
SAME
PARTY
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
WELCOME
JUST
NOT
THEIR
FELLOW
ARABS
FIRST
OF
ALL
THE
ARAB
STANDING
IN
ANY
PARTY
OR
AS
ANY
PARTY
IS
SOLELY
DEPENDENT
UPON
THE
AMOUNT
OF
POLITICAL
POWER
THEY
CAN
WIELD
EFFECTIVELY
IT
IS
NOT
A
QUESTION
OF
AN
INDIVIDUALS
STANDING
WHEN
A
PARTY
PUTS
UP
AN
ARAB
FOR
A
CABINET
POST
AND
THAT
ARAB
IS
REJECTED
BUT
THE
POSITION
IS
GIVEN
TO
A
JEW
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
WE
ARE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
POWER
BUT
RACISM
WOULD
YOU
CARE
TO
DENY
THIS
HAS
HAPPENED
ON
SEVERAL
OCCASIONS
WITH
LABOUR
COALITIONS
IN
THE
PAST
THEY
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
EFFECTIVE
AT
GARNERING
VOTES
AND
FORMING
A
SINGLE
BLOC
IN
THE
KNESSET
ON
THE
FEW
OCCASIONS
WHEN
THIS
WAS
DONE
SOME
OF
THE
PARTIES
TOOK
STANDS
THAT
WERE
EXTREMIST
AND
INEFFECT
PRECLUDED
THEMSELVES
FROM
FORMING
A
COALITION
AND
PARTICIPATING
IN
THE
CABINET
NOT
THEIR
PARTY
THEM
AS
INDIVIDUALS
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
BELONG
TO
NICE
PEACEFUL
ZIONIST
MAINSTREAM
PARTIES
THEY
ARE
NOT
WELCOME
ARABS
ARE
EXCLUDED
ON
FICITIOUS
SECURITY
GROUNDS
WHICH
ARE
JUST
AN
EXCUSE
IT
SURE
LOOKS
LIKE
RACISM
TO
ME
ARABS
ARE
EXCLUDED
FROM
CABINET
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
DO
THE
THINGS
YOU
SUGGEST
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
ARABS
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
YOU
HAVE
A
BETTER
REASON
I
AM
HAPPY
TO
LISTEN
TO
ANY
GOOD
REASON
WHY
A
LEFTIST
JEW
IS
LESS
OF
A
SECURITY
RISK
THAN
A
LEFTIST
ARAB
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
