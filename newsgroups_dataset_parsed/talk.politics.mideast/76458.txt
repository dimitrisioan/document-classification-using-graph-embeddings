EGYPT
CALL
FOR
FIGHTING
FUNDAMENTALISTS
OBJECTS
TO
PROBOSNIAN
STEPS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
EGYPT
IS
ONLY
INTERESTED
IN
FIGHTING
WARS
AGAINST
ITS
OWN
PEOPLE
WHILE
OBJECTING
TO
ANY
STEPS
FOR
BOSNIA
I
AM
NOT
SURPRISED
WHO
SAID
THAT
MUBARAK
REPRESENTS
EGYPT
HELL
HE
DOES
NOT
EVEN
REPRESENT
ALL
THE
CRIMINALS
OF
EGYPT

UPI

WERE
CONSIDERING
TUESDAY
A
REQUEST
FROM
BOSNIAHERZEGOVINA
FOR
MILLION
AND
WEAPONS
TO
FIGHT
THE
BOSNIAN
SERBS
THE
ONLY
COMMITMENT
SO
FAR
IS
MILLION
FROM
SAUDI
ARABIA
WHICH
THANKS
SAUDIA
FOR
THE
POCKET
CHANGE
COMPARE
THAT
TO
THE
LIBERATION

TO
WHAT
THEY
GAVE

SOURCES
ON
THE
POLITICAL
COMMITTEE
SAID
DELEGATES
WERE
IN
AGREEMENT
ON
THE
NEED
TO
HELP
THE
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
BUT
THE
REQUEST
FOR
WEAPONS
HAD
DELAYED
A
DECISION
IT
MAY
INTERPRETED
AS
VIOLATING
THE
UNITED

EMBARGO
ON

WARNED
EGYPTIAN
FOREIGN

MR
AMR
MOUSSA
WAS
NOT
WORRIED
ABOUT
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
WHEN
HE
TORTURED
TO
DEATH
MANY
OF
HIS
CITIZENS
AND
WHEN
HE
SHOT
PEOPLE
PRAYING
IN
A
MOSQUE
OR
WHEN
HE
IS
CAUSING
TROUBLE
TO
HIS
NEIGHBOR
JUST
BECASUE
THE
CIA
SAYS
SO
WHY
DOESNT
HE
JUST
SHUT
UP
HE
WONT
BE
INVOLVED
IN
ANY
BOSNIAN
EFFORT
ANYWAY
OR
DOES
THE
WEST
HAVE
TO
BE
REPRESENTED
EVEN
IN
AN
ISLAMIC
CONFERENCE
THE
MORE
I
HEAR
ABOUT
THE
EGYPTIAN
REGIME
THE

I
UNDERSTAND
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
THE
JAMAA
ISLAMIYAH
THERE
AFTER
ALL
MOST
OF
ITS
MEMBERS
AND
LEADERS
ARE
FORMER
AND
CURRENT
VICTIMS
OF
GOVERNMENT
TORTURE
INJUSTICE
OR
RELATIVES
OF
VICTIMS
IN
SOME
OTHER
PLACES
THEY
GET
PSYCHIATRIC
CARE
AND
REVENGE
IN
THE
COURTS
BUT
ALL
THEY
GOT
IS
MORE
OF
THE
SAME
RESULTING
IN
A
CYCLE
OF
MADNESS
THAT
IS
INITIATED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
WITH
THE
ILLICIT
SUPPORT
OF
THE
WEST
WHO
IS
MORE
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
SAFETY
OF
HALF
NAKED
TOURISTS
IN
CONSERVATIVE
NEIGHBORHOODS
THAN
THE
DIGNITY
SOCIAL
JUSTICE
AND
SAFETY
OF
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
POOR
OPPRESSED
PEOPLE
OF
EGYPT
ENOUGH
SAID

ALL
