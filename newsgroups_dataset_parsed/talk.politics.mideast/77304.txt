please
dont
be
offended
at
this
question
who
are
the
muslims
in
the
bosnian
context
i
know
that
a
moslemmuslim
is
a
believer
in
islam
islam
is
a
religion
and
it
is
practised
in
many
parts
of
the
world
but
it
is
not
yes
definitely
not
an
ethinic
group
ok
so
these
bosnian
muslims
who
are
they
to
which
ethnic
group
do
they
belong
what
languages
do
they
speak
do
they
have
a
different
language
from
that
of
the
serbs
or
croats
the
way
the
western
press
use
the
word
muslim
in
this
bosnian
debacle
has
kept
me
wondering
when
the
meaning
of
muslimmoslem
i
knew
from
childhood
was
changed
in
the
dictionary
this
is
just
a
question
no
flames
intended

mr
oguocha
muslims
in
the
bosnian
context
are
in
fact
turks
in
fact
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong
serbs
are
attacking
bosnians
with
their
battle
cries
death
to
the
turks
is
this
so
shocking
years
of
communism
apparently
suppressed
their
hatred
and
anger
towards
the
turks
but
such
hatred
is
obviously
one
that
dies
hard
serbs
must
understand
turks
are
no
longer
the
good
old
barbarians
world
has
come
to
know
by
propaganda
after
propaganda
serbs
must
further
understand
that
barbarism
does
not
work
serbs
must
even
further
understand
that
barbarism
would
one
day
have
to
face
counterbarbarism
so
i
urge
those
people
serbs
to
stop
killing
bosnian
women
and
children
and
they
must
never
forget
that
turks
in
the
motherland
are
