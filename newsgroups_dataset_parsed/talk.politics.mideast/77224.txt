THIS

RECOGNIZABLE
IN

AS

CONSERNED
I
FIND

SO

YOU
FORGOT
TO

THE
BALKAN

NOT

THE

HAD
MOMENTOUS
EFFECTS

FIND
IT
CURIOUS
THAT
A

I
LOVE
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT

THEN
SPOUT
MYTHS

WHERE
WERE

I
GUESS
THEY
WERE
BUSY

MORE

EVEN
THERE
INCREASED
PERSECUTION
BY

MANY

TO
FLEE
ELSEWHERE
IN

PARTICULARLY
TO
THE
GREAT

OF

DESPITE
ALL
THE

ALIKE
THE
