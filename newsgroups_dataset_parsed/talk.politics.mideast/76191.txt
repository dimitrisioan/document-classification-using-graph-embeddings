you
are
ignoring
the
fact
that
the
palestinians
in
lebanon
have
been
disarmed
hezbollah
remains
the
only
independent
militia
hezbollah
does
not
attack
israel
except
at
a
few
times
such
as
when
the
idf
burned
up
sheikh
mosavi
his
wife
and
young
son
of
course
if
israel
would
withdraw
from
lebanon
and
stop
assassinating
people
and
shelling
villages
they
wouldnt
make
the
lebanese
so
mad
as
to
do
that
furthermore
with
hezbollah
subsequently
disarmed
it
would
not
be
possible
just
to
address
this
one
point
what
about
the
two
katyusha
rocket
attacks
made
within
lebanon
for
which
fatah
claimed
responsibility
i
didnt
realize
that
one
can
use
katyushas
while
onr
is
disarmed
also
