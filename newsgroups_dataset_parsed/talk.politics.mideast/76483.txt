ADAM
SHOSTACK
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
IS
ISRAELS
OCCUPATION
OF
SOUTHERN
LEBANON
TEMPORARY
ISRAEL
HAS
REPEATEDLY
STATED
THAT
IT
WILL
LEAVE
LEBANON
WHEN
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
CAN
PROVIDE
GUARANTEES
THAT
ISRAEL
WILL
NOT
BE
ATTACKED
FROM
LEBANESE
SOIL
AND
WHEN
THE
SYRIANS
LEAVE
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
SYRIA
AND
LEBANON
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
DETERMINE
IF
THEY
WISH
TO
RETURN
TO
THE
SITUATION
PRIOR
TO
THE
FRENCH
INVASION
WHERE
THEY
WERE
BOTH
PART
OF
THE
SAME
MANDATE
TERRITORY
READ
COLONY
ISRAEL
HAS
NO
RIGHT
TO
DETERMINE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IN
LEBANON
INVADING
ANOTHER
COUNTRY
BECAUSE
YOU
CONSIDER
THEM
A
THREAT
IS
PRECISELY
THE
WAY
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
WARS
OF
AGGRESSION
HAVE
STARTED
IS
ISRAELS
OCCUPATION
OF
THE
WEST
BANK
GAZA
AND
GOLAN
TEMPORARY
THE
THREE
ARE
VERY
DIFFERENT
ISSUES
ISRAEL
HAS
STATED
REPEATEDLY
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
GIVE
UP
THE
WHOLE
GOLAN
BUT
MAY
BE
WILLING
TO
GIVE
PART
OF
IT
TO
SYRIA
AS
PART
OF
A
PEACE
AGREEMENT
AGAIN
TERRITORIAL
EXPANSION
BY
FORCE
ISRAEL
HAS
ALREADY
ANNEXED
AREAS
TAKEN
OVER
IN
THE
WAR
THESE
AREAS
ARE
NOT
OCCUPIED
BUT
DISPUTED
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
LEGITAMATE
GOVERNING
BODY
CITIZENSHIP
WAS
GIVEN
TO
THOSE
RESIDENTS
IN
ANNEXED
AREAS
WHO
WANTED
CITIZENSHIP
THE
UN
DEFINES
THEM
AS
OCCUPIED
THEY
ARE
RECOGNISED
AS
SUCH
BY
EVERY
NATION
ON
EARTH
EXCLUDING
ONE
SMALL
CARIBEAN
ISLAND
ISRAEL
SHOULD
KEEP
CONTROL
OF
PARTS
OF
THE
WEST
BANK
IMHO
THE
PARTS
THAT
SHOULD
BE
KEPT
ARE
THE
WESTERNMOST
MOUNTAIN
RIDGE
WHICH
CONTAIN
FEW
ARAB
TOWNS
AND
MANY
SUBURBS
AS
WELL
AS
OVERLOOKING
THE
CITY
OF
TEL
AVIV
THE
EASTERN
MOUNTAIN
RIDGE
SHOULD
BE
ABANDONDED
THIS
IS
WHERE
MOST
OF
THE
ARABS
LIVE
AND
IT
IS
LESS
MILITARILY
RELEVANT
ISRAEL
SHOULD
ALSO
MAINTAIN
A
PRESENCE
IN
THE
JORDAN
VALLEY
SO
THE
ADAM
THINKS
THAT
PEACE
IS
POSSIBLE
WITH
CONTINUED
OCCUPATION
AND
A
CONTINUED
MILITARY
PRESENCE
THAT
IS
A
COMPLETELY
UNSUSTAINABLE
SITUATION
BECAUSE
THE
USA
IS
BANKRUPT
AND
SIMPLY
CANNOT
AFFORD
TO
FINANCE
THE
ISRAELI
ECCONOMY
ANY
MORE
THERE
IS
NO
MONEY
FOR
SUCH
AN
OCCUPATION
IF
SO
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
SUPPORT
IT
WHY
WERE
SO
MANY
SETTLERS
MOVED
INTO
THE
TERRITORIES
IF
IT
IS
NOT
TEMPORARY
LETS
HEAR
IT
THERE
ARE
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
FOR
PEOPLE
TO
MOVE
THEY
WERE
NOT
MOVED
BUT
CHOSE
TO
MOVE
INTO
DISPUTED
AREAS
NOTE
THAT
SINCE
THESE
MOVES
WERE
MADE
BY
FREE
WILLED
HUMAN
BEINGS
NOT
SETTLERS
I
WILL
ADDRESS
TWO
ASPECTS
OF
YOUR
QUESTION
WHY
THE
GOVERNMENT
WOULD
ALLOW
OR
ENCOURAGE
THEM
TO
MOVE
AND
SECOND
WHY
THEY
DID
MOVE
THEY
WERE
MOVED
IN
AS
PART
OF
A
DELIBERATE
POLICY
TO
PREVENT
THE
RETURN
OF
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
MACHIAVELLI
DESCRIBED
THE
REASONING
IN
THE
PRINCE
THE
CLEAR
INTENTION
WAS
TO
CREATE
A
CONSTITUENCY
WHICH
THE
LIKUD
BELEIVED
COULD
NOT
BE
DEPRIVED
OF
THE
LAND
STOLEN
FROM
THE
INDIGENOUS
POPULATION
THE
PRETEXTS
UNDER
WHICH
THE
SETTLERS
AQUIRED
LAND
WAS
THROUGH
THE
REDEFINITION
OF
MUCH
LAND
USED
IN
COMMON
AS
PUBLIC
LAND
THE
ASSERTION
THAT
THE
VILLAGE
COMMON
ON
WHICH
THE
VILLAGE
DEPENDS
FOR
FOOD
BELONGS
TO
AN
INVADER
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
NO
INDIVIDUAL
HAS
TITLE
IS
CLEARLY
AN
EXCUSE
WHEN
THE
LAND
IS
USED
TO
BUILD
A
CONDOMINIUM
FOR
ALIENS
BROUGHT
IN
TO
OCCUPY
THE
LAND
FOR
A
FOREIGN
POWER
THERE
IS
A
CLEAR
BREACH
OF
THE
GENEVA
CONVENTION
WHICH
STIPULATES
THAT
LAND
USE
IN
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
MUST
NOT
BE
CHANGED
NO
AMOUNT
OF
SELF
JUSTIFYING
ON
THE
PART
OF
LIKUD
AND
HARD
LINNER
APPOLOGISTS
WILL
CHANGE
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
MAJORITY
OF
WORLD
GOVERNMENTS
AND
ALL
OF
THOSE
THAT
ACTUALLY
HAVE
ANY
POWER
HAVE
CONDEMNED
THIS
PRACTICE
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAD
A
NUMBER
OF
REASONS
FOR
ENCOURAGING
PEOPLE
TO
MOVE
ACROSS
THE
GREEN
LINE
THEY
INCLUDED
SECURITY
AND
POLITICS
THE
FIRST
REASON
WAS
SECURITY
A
LARGE
JEWISH
PRESENSE
MAKES
IT
DIFFICULT
FOR
TERRORISTS
TO
INFILTRATE
A
JEWISH
SETTLEMENTS
ALSO
ACT
AS
FORTRESSES
IN
TIMES
OF
WAR
THEYU
ALSO
ARE
A
LIABILITY
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
CIVILIAN
ENCAMPMENTS
THAT
WOULD
LAST
NO
MORE
THAN
HOURS
AGAINST
TANKS
A
SECOND
REASON
WAS
POLITICAL
CREATING
SETTLEMENTS
BROUGHT
THE
ARABS
TO
THE
NEGOTIATION
TABLE
HAD
THE
CREATION
OF
NEW
TOWNS
AND
CITIES
GONE
ON
ANOTHER
SEVERAL
YEARS
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
PLACE
LEFT
IN
ISRAEL
WHERE
THERE
WAS
AN
ARAB
MAJORITY
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NO
LAND
LEFT
THAT
COULD
BE
CALLED
ARAB
DONT
FOOL
YOURSELF
IT
WAS
THE
GULF
WAR
THAT
BROUGHT
THE
ISRAELIS
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
ONCE
THEIR
US
BACKERS
HAD
A
SECURE
BASE
IN
THE
GULF
THEY
INSRTRUCTED
SHAMIR
TO
NEGOTIATE
OR
ELSE
IF
THE
CREATION
OF
SETTLEMENTS
HAD
GONE
ON
ANY
LONGER
THE
USA
WOULD
HAVE
CUT
THE
MONEY
SUPPLY
THE
FACT
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
HUNDERED
THOUSANDS
JEWS
IN
PLACE
CHANGES
THE
FACE
OF
ANY
PEACE
SETTLEMENT
AND
RESTRICTS
WHAT
LAND
CAN
BE
GIVEN
AWAY
NOT
AT
ALL
THEY
CAN
CHOSE
TO
LIVE
IN
AN
ARAB
STATE
OR
RETURN
TO
ISRAEL
SOME
OF
THE
COMMUNITES
CREATED
WERE
RELIGIOUS
THEY
BUILT
THEIR
NEIGHBORHOODS
IN
AREAS
WHERE
THERE
WERE
JEWS
UNTIL
THE
RIOTS
OF
THE
AND
THERE
ARE
COMMUNITIES
LIKE
THIS
IN
HEBRON
GAZA
AND
ALL
OVER
THERE
ARE
ALSO
COMMUNITIES
BUILT
NEAR
RELIGIOUS
SITES
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
COMUNITY
DOES
NOT
GIVE
THE
RIGHT
FOR
ANOTHER
COUNTRY
TO
ANNEXE
TERRITORY
NOT
IN
BOSNIA
NOT
IN
THE
WEST
BANK
THE
POINT
IS
THERE
ARE
MANY
REASONS
PEOPLE
MOVED
OVER
THE
GREEN
LINE
AND
MANY
REASONS
THE
GOVERNMENT
WANTED
THEM
TO
WHATEVER
STATUS
IS
NEGOTIATED
FOR
DISPUTED
TERRITORIES
IT
WILL
NOT
BE
AN
ALL
OR
NOTHING
DEAL
NEW
BOUNDARIES
WILL
BE
DRAWN
UP
BY
NEGOTIATION
NOT
BE
THE
RESULTS
OF
A
WAR
UNLESS
THE
NEW
BOUNDARIES
DRAWN
UP
ARE
THOSE
OF
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
PEACE
ARAFFAT
HAS
PRECIOUS
LITTLE
AUTHORITY
TO
AGREE
TO
ANYTHING
ELSE
THE
REAL
ISSUE
IS
NOT
THE
LAND
TREATY
BUT
THE
TRADE
TREATY
SINCE
THE
PALESTINIANS
WILL
REMAIN
HEAVILY
DEPENDENT
ON
ISRAEL
INDEFINITELY
IT
IS
THIS
THAT
WILL
BE
THE
GUARANTOR
OF
PEACE
ANOTHER
FACTOR
WILL
BE
THE
RETURN
OF
LANDS
CONFISCATED
BY
THE
ISRAELI
STATE
WITHIN
ISRAEL
AND
THE
DISMANTLING
OF
THE
SHADOW
STRUCTURES
WHICH
ALLOW
DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST
NONJEWS
WITHIN
WHAT
IS
NOMINALY
A
SECULAR
STATE
THE
IRONY
IS
THAT
IN
RETURN
FOR
A
GUARANTEE
THAT
THE
PALESTINIAN
STATE
HAS
A
NON
DESCRIMINATION
LAW
IN
ORDER
TO
PROTECT
THE
REMAINING
SETTLERS
THE
ISRAELI
STATE
IS
GOING
TO
BE
FORCED
INOT
THE
SAME
POSITION
THIS
WILL
MEAN
OUTLAWING
OF
DISCRIMINATION
SUCH
AS
THAT
WHICH
PREVENTS
ARABS
FROM
BUYING
OR
USING
MUCH
OF
THE
LAND

HALLAMBAKER
