THERE
ARE
ARABS
IN
CABINET
BUT
LOOK
HOW
LONG
IT
TOOK
AND
TO
WHAT
INSIGNIFICANT
POSITIONS
THEY
ARE
ASSIGNED
AND
THIS
IS
BASED
SOLELY
ON
RACE
NOT
POLITICAL
BELIEF
OR
SECURITY
AS
JEWISH
MEMBERS
OF
THE
SAME
PARTY
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
WELCOME
JUST
NOT
THEIR
FELLOW
ARABS
FIRST
OF
ALL
THE
ARAB
STANDING
IN
ANY
PARTY
OR
AS
ANY
PARTY
IS
SOLELY
DEPENDENT
UPON
THE
AMOUNT
OF
POLITICAL
POWER
THEY
CAN
WIELD
EFFECTIVELY
IT
IS
NOT
A
QUESTION
OF
AN
INDIVIDUALS
STANDING
WHEN
A
PARTY
PUTS
UP
AN
ARAB
FOR
A
CABINET
POST
AND
THAT
ARAB
IS
REJECTED
BUT
THE
POSITION
IS
GIVEN
TO
A
JEW
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
WE
ARE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
POWER
BUT
RACISM
NOT
NECESSARILY
AS
SHAI
POINTS
OUT
POLITICAL
APPOINTMENTS
ARE
BASED
ON
POWER
THEY
ARE
ALSO
BASED
ON
FAVORS
OWED
COALITION
BUILDING
AND
DEAL
MAKING
WHILE
THIS
MAY
HAVE
A
RACIST
ELEMENT
TO
IT
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
MUCH
MORE
FAIR
TO
ATTRIBUTE
IT
TO
THE
OLD
BOY
NATURE
OF
POLITICS
NOW
ILL
FREELY
ADMIT
THAT
THE
OLD
BOY
SYSTEM
HAS
RACIST
AND
SEXIST
EFFECTS
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THOSE
ARE
ITS
PURPOSE
WHETHER
IN
THE
US
ISRAEL
OR
ELSEWHERE
IN
THE
PAST
THEY
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
EFFECTIVE
AT
GARNERING
VOTES
AND
FORMING
A
SINGLE
BLOC
IN
THE
KNESSET
ON
THE
FEW
OCCASIONS
WHEN
THIS
WAS
DONE
SOME
OF
THE
PARTIES
TOOK
STANDS
THAT
WERE
EXTREMIST
AND
INEFFECT
PRECLUDED
THEMSELVES
FROM
FORMING
A
COALITION
AND
PARTICIPATING
IN
THE
CABINET
NOT
THEIR
PARTY
THEM
AS
INDIVIDUALS
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
BELONG
TO
NICE
PEACEFUL
ZIONIST
MAINSTREAM
PARTIES
THEY
ARE
NOT
WELCOME
ARABS
ARE
EXCLUDED
ON
FICITIOUS
SECURITY
GROUNDS
WHICH
ARE
JUST
AN
EXCUSE
IT
SURE
LOOKS
LIKE
RACISM
TO
ME
HERE
AGAIN
YOU
MISS
OUT
ON
THE
OLD
BOY
NATURE
OF
POLITICS
AND
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
BACKROOM
DEALS
AS
INDIVIDUALS
THESE
ARABS
MAY
NOT
BE
AS
WELL
CONNECTED
AS
THE
JEW
WHO
GETS
THE
JOB
I
DONT
LIKE
THIS
ASPECT
OF
POLITICS
BUT
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
EXISTS

WASTE
THEM
ON
