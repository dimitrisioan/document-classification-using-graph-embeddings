a

by
julian
kossoff
and
lindsay
schusman
in
jewish
chronicle
london
dec
leading
israeli
author
and
cultural
commentator
ab
yehoshua
launched
a
ferocious
attack
on
diaspora
jewry
at
a
zionist
youth
council
meeting
in
north
london
last
week
the
diaspora
he
claimed
was
the
cancer
connected
to
the
main
tissue
of
the
jewish
people
he
was
scathing
about
its
failure
to
act
before
the
holocaust
he
said
the
diasporas
religious
and
secular
leadership
had
ignored
the
warning
signs
in
the
and
had
fiercely
opposed
zionism
consequently
he
considered
the
holocaust
the
failure
of
judaism
his
talk
entitled
diaspora
a
neurotic
solution
covered
years
of
jewish
history
mr
yehoshuas
other
targets
included
soviet
jews
who
were
he
said
not
staying
in
israel
but
running
away
and
all
jews
outside
israel
who
were
using
other
peoples
countries
like
hotels
the
only
conclusion
he
could
draw
was
that
the
diaspora
was
immoral
because
it
looked
to
israel
for
its
identity
but
lived
elsewhere
worse
it
threatened
israel
itself
creating
a
distraction
for
her
citizens
who
were
leaving
by
the
thousands
mr
yehoshua
who
described
himself
as
a
soldier
for
aliyah
ended
by
calling
for
the
creation
of
a
new
total
jew
living
in
israel
earlier
speaking
at
a
meeting
of
jewish
students
on
the
difficulties
of
forging
a
national
identity
in
israeli
literature
mr
yehoshua
claimed
that
israeli
writers
were
paralyzed
by
the
countrys
political
situation
he
said
israels
wars
had
once
provided
writers
with
a
vital
source
of
inspiration
today
israeli
writers
avoided
writing
directly
about
the
arabisraeli
conflict
no
major
work
had
been
produced
about
the
intifada
instead
writers
were
tackling
themes
such
as
jewish
identity
emigration
from
israel
and
personal
and
family
issues
mr
yehoshua
admitted
he
also
felt
unable
to
write
about
the
israeli
political
situation
he
could
no
longer
step
into
an
israeli
arabs
shoes
and
portray
him
as
a
real
flesh
and
blood
character
he
claimed
that
after
years
of
statehood
the
problem
of
israeli
identity
had
not
been
solved
he
said
jews
remained
too
preoccupied
with
the
borders
of
identity
between
jew
and
nonjew
and
were
not
concerned
with
the
nature
of
that
identity
jewish
values
in
israel
embraced
every
aspect
of
daily
life
unlike
in
the
diaspora
where
jews
had
no
responsibility
for
the
country
they
lived
in
he
said
he
warned
that
modern
hebrew
a
unifying
force
for
the
jewish
people
would
have
to
struggle
for
its
future
especially
in
literary
circles
it
faced
fierce
competition
from
the
english
language
