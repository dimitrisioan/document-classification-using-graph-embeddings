re
europe
vs
muslim
bosnians
in
article
writes
please
dont
be
offended
at
this
question
who
are
the
muslims
in
the
bosnian
context
bosnian
muslims
are
citizens
od
bosniaherzegovina
who
identify
themselves
with
bosnian
muslim
cultural
and
religious
tradition
i
know
that
a
moslemmuslim
is
a
believer
in
islam
islam
is
a
religion
and
it
is
practised
in
many
parts
of
the
world
but
it
is
not
yes
definitely
not
an
ethinic
group
ok
so
these
bosnian
muslims
who
are
they
to
which
ethnic
group
do
they
belong
what
languages
do
they
speak
do
they
have
a
different
language
from
that
of
the
serbs
or
croats
in
bosnia
muslim
is
not
merely
a
religious
category
but
an
ethnic
one
as
well
actually
here
are
the
two
contradictory
arguments
made
by
people
on
this
subject
there
is
only
serbian
and
croatian
nationality
and
bosnian
muslims
are
simply
croats
and
serbs
of
islamic
faith
bosnian
muslims
are
a
separate
nationality
since
they
do
not
feel
themselves
to
be
croats
nor
serbs
in
argument
was
accepted
by
former
yugoslavia
as
valid
and
was
soundly
rejected
the
reasons
are
pragmatic
even
if
bosnian
muslims
are
croats
and
serbs
who
converted
to
islam
under
turkish
rule
centuries
ago
none
of
the
present
generation
has
any
clue
what
was
their
ancestors
actual
nationality
in
fact
although
bosnian
muslims
have
felt
drawn
to
croatian
or
serbian
national
allegiance
most
of
them
feel
they
have
a
separate
cultural
and
historic
identity
so
arguments
like
yes
but
your
ancestors
were
croats
or
serbs
carry
very
little
weight
regardless
of
what
their
ancestors
might
have
been
as
long
as
bosnian
muslims
feel
that
they
are
a
separate
national
group
that
ends
the
debate
what
outsiders
say
is
simply
not
relevant
the
way
the
western
press
use
the
word
muslim
in
this
bosnian
debacle
has
kept
me
wondering
when
the
meaning
of
muslimmoslem
i
knew
from
childhood
was
changed
in
the
dictionary
this
is
just
a
question
no
flames
intended
in
the
case
of
former
yugoslavia
the
date
is
when
muslim
nationality
appeared
as
a
census
category
for
the
first
time
this
was
the
result
of
a
sequence
of
decisions
over
the
past
decade
from
recognizing
bosniaks
as
an
ethnic
group
to
february
resolution
in
bh
declaring
that
muslims
are
a
separate
nation
to
formal
endorsement
of
this
in
january
and
eventually
to
the
inclusion
of
muslim
nationality
choice
in
census
forms
for
comparison
in
census
there
were
three
national
categories
available
to
muslims
in
bosniaherzegovina
serbmuslims
croatmuslims
muslims
ethnically
undeclared
this
clearly
demonstrates
that
muslims
feel
themselves
to
be
their
own
nationality
only
a
tiny
minority
felt
able
to
choose
serb
or
croat
nationality
census
results
show
that
bosnian
muslims
have
consistently
opted
for
a
third
category
in
they
chose
undeclared
in
they
chose
yugoslavs
in
both
yugoslavs
and
bosniak
ethnic
group
and
in
and
they
chose
muslim
nationality
perhaps
the
term
bosnian
muslim
nationality
is
too
confusing
for
the
rest
of
the
world
but
in
the
present
context
we
are
talking
about
muslims
as
nationality
not
as
a
religous
group
within
some
separate
national
identity
the
reasons
are
mostly
historical
and
cultural
religion
plays
a
smaller
role
as
a
part
of
culture
in
general
because
the
area
is
simply
not
known
for
religious
fanaticism
political
fanaticism
yes
religious
fanaticism
no
group
security
and
survival
dominate
peoples
thinking
not
fine
points
of
theology
in
fact
bosniaherzegovina
is
as
well
known
for
religious
tolerance
in
peacetime
as
it
is
known
for
terrible
carnage
in
wartime
