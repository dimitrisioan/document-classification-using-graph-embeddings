writes
this
is
nonsense
i
lived
in
the
negev
for
many
years
and
i
can
say
for
sure
that
no
beduins
were
moved
or
harmed
in
any
way
on
the
contrary
their
standard
of
living
has
climbed
sharply
many
of
them
now
live
in
rather
nice
permanent
houses
and
own
cars
there
are
quite
a
few
beduin
students
in
the
bengurion
university
there
are
good
friendly
relations
between
them
and
the
rest
of
the
population
all
the
beduins
i
met
would
be
rather
surprised
to
read
mr
davidsons
poster
i
have
to
say
danny
keren
it
is
nonsense
danny
if
you
can
refute
it
with
proof
if
you
are
citing
your
experience
then
you
should
have
been
there
in
the
the
article
is
comparing
the
condition
then
with
that
now
otherwise
it
is
you
who
is
trying
to
change
the
facts
