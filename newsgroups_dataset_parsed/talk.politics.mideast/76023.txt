MR

WELL
PANOS
MR
TAMAMIDIS
THE
WAY
YOU
PUT
IT
IT
IS
ONLY
THE
TURKS
WHO
BEAR
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
THE
THINGS
HAPPENING
TODAY
THAT
IS
HARD
TO
BELIEVE
FOR
SOMEBODY
TRYING
TO
BE
OBJECTIVE
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
CONFLICTS
LIKE
OUR
COUNTRIES
HAVING
YOU
CANNOT
BLAME
ONE
SIDE
ONLY
THERE
ALWAYS
ARE
BAD
GUYS
ON
BOTH
SIDES
WHAT
WERE
YOU
DOING
ON
ANATOLIA
AFTER
THE
ANYWAY
DO
YOU
THINK
IT
WAS
YOUR
RIGHT
TO
BE
THERE
THERE
WERE
A
COUPLE
MILLIONS
OF
GREEKS
LIVING
IN
ASIA
MINOR
UNTIL
SOMEONE
HAD
TO
PROTECT
THEM
IF
NOT
US
WHO
IS
THAT
SO
OR
YOU
WERE
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
WEAKNESS
OF
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
TO
GRAB
SOME
LAND
AS
SOON
AS
YOU
GOT
GREEN
LIGHTS
FROM
ALLIED
FORCES
YOU
OCCUPIED
IZMIR
AND
OTHER
CITIES
IN
WESTERN
TURKEY
YOU
KILLED
AND
RAPED
MILLIONS
PEOPLE
WITHOUT
ANY
REASON
OF
COURSE
YOU
PAID
THE
PRICE
MUSTAFA
KEMAL
ATATURK
MADE
YOU
SWIM
IN
AEGEAN
SEA
BUT
NOT
FAR
ENOUGH
YOUR
AGGRESSIONS
THRU
TURKEY
AT
ANYTIME
IN
THE
PAST
DID
NOT
GET
YOU
ANY
REWARD
AND
SHALL
NOT
GET
YOU
ANYWHERE
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
CONFLICTS
STARTED
WITH
THAT
IT
IS
ONLY
NOT
ONE
SIDE
BEING
THE
AGGRESSIVE
AND
THE
ITHER
ALWAYS
SUFFERING
IT
IS
SAD
THAT
WE
BOTH
STILL
ARE
NOT
TRYING
TO
COMPROMISE
I
REMEMBER
THE
ACTION
OF
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
BY
REMOVING
THE
VISA
REQUIREMENT
FOR
GREEKS
TO
COME
TO
TURKEY
I
THOUGHT
IT
WAS
A
POSITIVE
ATTEMPT
TO
MAKE
THE
RELATIONS
BETTER
COMPROMISE
ON
WHAT
THE
INVASION
OF
CYPRUS
THE
INVOLMENT
OF
TURKEY
IN
GREEK
POLITICS
THE
REFUSAL
OF
TURKEY
TO
ACCEPT
MILES
OF
TERRITORIAL
WATERS
AS
STATED
BY
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
THE
PROPERTIES
OF
THE
GREEKS
OF
KONSTANTINOPLE
THE
OWNERSHIP
OF
THE
ISLANDS
IN
THE
GREEK
LAKESORRY
AEGEAN
WHAT
COMPROMISE
ARE
YOU
TALKING
ABOUT
ON
CYPRUS
THAT
IS
NOT
GREECE
BUSINESS
TO
JOIN
THE
ISLAND
TO
GREECE
THAT
IS
UP
TO
PEOPLE
IN
THE
ISLAND
TO
LIVE
OR
NOT
TO
LIVE
TOGETHER
THEY
MADE
THEIR
DECISION
AND
THEY
ARE
LIVING
SEPARETELY
NOWTHERE
IS
A
PEACE
THERE
GREEKS
CANT
SLAUGHTER
TURKS
ANYMORE
BECAUSE
TURKISH
PEACEMAKING
FORCE
IS
THERE
YOUR
DREAM
WILL
NEVER
COME
TRUE
MILE
TERRITORIALWATER
ARE
YOU
JOKING
OR
DREAMING
WE
CAN
DECLARE
OUR
MILES
TERRITORIAL
WATER
WHICH
CAN
COME
CLOSE
TO
ATHENS
HOW
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
IT
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
GUTS
WHY
DONT
YOU
SHOOT
AT
SOME
TURKISH
SHIPS
IN
YOUR
DREAM
MILE
TERRITORIAL
WATERS
WE
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
CITY
CALLED
KONSTANTINOPLE
WE
HAVE
A
CITY
CALLED
ISTANBUL
ALL
THE
GREEKS
IN
ISTANBUL
ARE
BEING
TREATED
JUST
ANY
OTHER
TURKS
THERE
IS
NO
DIFFERENCE
AMONG
PEOPLE
IN
TURKEY
YOU
LOOK
AT
YOUR
OWN
BACKYARD
FIRST
BEFORE
TALKING
ABOUT
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IN
TURKEY
WHAT
ARE
THE
RIGHTS
OF
TURKS
IN
GREECE
NOTHING
THEY
DO
NOT
EVEN
HAVE
BASIC
HUMAN
RIGHTS
LIKE
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
PROPERTY
FREDOM
OF
RELIGION
FREDOM
OF
PRESS
FREDOM
OF

ELECT
THEIR
COMMUNITY
LEADERS
GOVERNMENT
OF
GREECE
PUBLICLY
ENCOURAGES
PEOPLE
TO
DESTROY
AND
BURN
SCHOOLS
RELIGIOUS
PLACES
HOUSES
AND
FARMS
BELONG
TO
TURKISH
MINORITY
THEN
GREEK
GOVERNMENT
FORCES
THESE
MINORITIES
TO
GO
TO
TURKEY
WITHOUT
ANYTHING
WITH
THEM
YOU
WILL
DREAM
TO
SEE
AEGEAN
SEA
AS
GREEK
LAKE
BUT
IT
WILL
NEVER
HAPPEN
THINK
ABOUT
THE
WAR
BETWEEN
TURKEY
AND
GREECE
IN
THE
RIVER
CALLED
SAKARYA
FLOOD
DAYS
FILLED
WITH
BLOOD
IN
THE
GREEKS
I
MENTIONED
WHO
WOULDNT
TALK
TO
ME
ARE
EDUCATED
PEOPLE
THEY
HAVE
NEVER
MET
ME
BUT
THEY
KNOW
I
AM
BAD
PERSON
BECAUSE
I
AM
FROM
TURKEY
POLITICS
IS
NOT
MY
BUSINESS
AND
IT
IS
NOT
THE
BUSINESS
OF
MOST
OF
THE
TURKS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
INDIVIDUALS
WHY
THE
HATRED
ANY
PERSON
WHO
SUPPORTS
THE
POLICIES
OF
THE
TURKISH
GOVERMENT
DIRECTLY
OR
INDIRECLY
IS
A
BAD
PERSON
IT
IS
NOT
YOUR
NATIONALITY
THAT
MAKES
YOU
BAD
IT
IS
YOUR
SUPPORT
OF
THE
ACTIONS
OF
YOUR
GOVERMENT
THAT
MAKE
YOU
BAD
PEOPLE
DO
NOT
HATE
YOU
BECAUSE
OF
WHO
YOU
ARE
BUT
BECAUSE
OF
WHAT
YOU
ARE
YOU
ARE
A
SUPPORTER
OF
THE
POLICIES
OF
THE
TURKISH
GOVERMENT
AND
AS
A
SUCH
YOU
MUST
PAY
THE
PRICE
YOU
MEAN
THAT
ANY
PERSON
WHO
SUPPORTS
THE
ACTIONS
AND
POLICIES
OF
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
GREECE
IS
A
GOOD
PERSON
THAT
IS
YOUR
GREEK
IDEA
TO
SAY
TURKS
ARE
BAD
PEOPLE
WE
KNOW
WHO
WE
ARE
AND
PROUD
TO
BE
TURKS
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
WORLD
THAT
IS
NOT
GREEKS
BUSINESS
TO
TELL
US
WHAT
KIND
OF
PEOPLE
WE
ARE
YOU
ARE
NOT
AT
POSITION
TO
JUDGE
PEOPLE
BECAUSE
YOU
ARE
NOT
CIVILIZED
ENOUGH
TO
GIVE
EQUAL
RIGHTS
TO
YOUR
OWN
MINORITIES
MILLIONS
OF
MINORITIES
ARE
BEING
TREATED
AS
THIRD
CLASS
CITIZEN
THEIR
RIGHTS
ARE
TAKEN
AWAY
FROM
THEM
AND
THEY
HAVE
NO
VOICES
UNDER
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
GREECE
THEY
ARE
ALMOST
BEING
TREATED
AS
SLAVES
EVEN
THOUGH
WE
ARE
GETTING
INTO
CENTURY
THEREFORE
DO
NOT
MAKE
ME
LAUGHT
AT
YOU
SO
THAT
MAKES
ME
THINK
THAT
THERE
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
BRAINWASHING
GOING
ON
IN
GREECE
AFTER
ALL
WHY
WOULD
AN
EDUCATED
PERSON
TREAT
EVERY
PERSON
FROM
A
NATION
THE
SAME
WAY
CAN
YOU
TELL
ME
ABOUT
YOUR
HISTORY
BOOKS
AND
THINGS
