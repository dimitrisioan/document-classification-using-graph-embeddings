I
LIKE
WHAT
MR
JOSEPH
BIDEN
HAD
TO
SAY
YESTERDAY
IN
THE
SENATE
CONDEMENING
THE
EUROPEAN
LACK
OF
ACTION
AND
LACK
OF
SUPPORT
TO
US
PLANS
AND
CALLING
THAT
MORAL
RAPE
HE
WENT
ON
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
REASON
FOR
THAT
IS
OUT
RIGHT
RELIGIOUS
BIGOTRY
ACTUALLY
THIS
STRIFE
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
GOES
BACK
A
LONG
WAY
BOSINAN
MUSLIMS
IN
COLLABORATION
WITH
THE
NAZIS
DID
TO
SERBIANS
AFTER
THE
FIRST
WORLD
WAR
WHAT
SERBS
ARE
DOING
TO
MUSLIMS
NOW
THIS
IS
NOT
A
FRESH
CASE
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
BUT
JUST
ANOTHER
CHAPTER
IN
THE
CONTINUING
SAGA
OF
INTENSE
MUTUAL
HATRED
DESTRUCTION
NOT
TAKING
SIDES
IN
THIS
PERPETUAL
WAR
DOES
NOT
AMOUNT
TO
RELIGIOUS
BIGOTRY
IT
COULD
JUST
BE
HELPLESSNESS
WITH
REGARDS
TO
BRINGING
PEACE
TO
A
REGION
THAT
DOES
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORD
I
DONT
THINK
YOURE
CORRECT
HERE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
NO
REPORTS
OF
THE
BOSNIANS
MUSLIMS
SUPPORTING
THE
NAZIS
IN
THEIR
GENOCIDE
AGAINST
THE
SERBIANS
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THE
CROAT
GOVT
USING
THEIR
SECRET
POLICE
CALLED
THE
USTACHE
I
THINK
WERE
THE
PRIME
AGENTS
OF
THE
NAZIS
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
AGAINST
THE
SERBS
SS
DIVISON
MADE
PRIMERILY
OF
BOSNIAN
MUSLIM
VOLUNTEERS
DID
QUITE
A
JOB
IN
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
DURING
WWII
THESE
FOLKS
ARE
NOW
IN
THEIR
MAKES
ME
WONDER
HOW
MANY
OF
THEM
OCCUPY
POSITIONS
OF
POWER
IN
BOSNIAS
GOVERMENT
