HASANMCRCIMMCGILLEDU
WRITES
OK
I
DONOT
KNOW
WHY
THERE
ARE
ISRAELI
VOICES
AGAINST
NEGOTIATIONS
HOWEVER
I
WOULD
GUESS
THAT
IS
BECAUSE
THEY
REFUSE
GIVING
BACK
A
LAND
FOR
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
FOR
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
WISHFUL
GUESSING
AS
FOR
THE
ARABIAN
AND
PALESTINEAN
VOICES
THAT
ARE
AGAINST
THE
CURRENT
NEGOTIATIONS
AND
THE
SOCALLED
PEACE
PROCESS
THEY
ARE
NOT
AGAINST
PEACE
PER
SE
BUT
RATHER
FOR
THEIR
WELLFOUNDED
PREDICTIONS
THAT
ISRAEL
WOULD
NOT
GIVE
AN
INCH
OF
THE
WEST
BANK
AND
MOST
PROBABLY
THE
SAME
FOR
GOLAN
HEIGHTS
BACK
TO
THE
ARABS
AN
MONTHS
OF
NEGOTIATIONS
IN
MADRID
AND
WASHINGTON
PROVED
THESE
PREDICTIONS
NOW
MANY
WILL
JUMP
ON
ME
SAYING
WHY
ARE
YOU
BLAMING
ISRAELIS
FOR
NORESULT
NEGOTIATIONS
I
WOULD
SAY
WHY
WOULD
THE
ARABS
STALL
THE
NEGOTIATIONS
WHAT
DO
THEY
HAVE
TO
LOOSE
SOCALLED
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
HOW
WOULD
YOU
SEE
THE
PEACE
PROCESS
SO
YOU
SAY
PALESTINEANS
DO
NOT
NEGOCIATE
BECAUSE
OF
WELLFOUNDED
PREDICTIONS
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
WELL
FOUNDED
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
TEST
THEM
AT
THE
TABLE
MONTHS
DID
NOT
PROVE
ANYTHING
BUT
ITS
ALWAYS
THE
OTHER
SIDE
AT
FAULT
RIGHT
WHY
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHY
BUT
IF
LETS
SAY
THE
PALESTINEANS
SOME
OF
THEM
WANT
ALL
ISRAEL
AND
THESE
ARE
KNOWN
NOT
TO
BE
ACCEPTED
TERMS
BY
ISRAELIS
OR
MAYBE
THEY
PALESTINENANS
ARE
NOT
YET
READY
FOR
STATEHOOD
OR
MAYBE
THERE
IS
TOO
MUCH
POLITICS
WITHIN
THE
PALESTINEAN
LEADERSHIP
TOO
MANY
FRACTIONS
ASO
I
AM
NOT
SAYING
THAT
ONE
OF
THESE
REASONS
IS
INDEED
THE
REAL
ONE
BUT
ANY
OF
THESE
COULD
MAKE
ARABS
STALL
THE
NEGOTIATIONS
ARABS
FEEL
THAT
THE
CURRENT
NEGOTIATIONS
IS
ONLY
FOR
LEGITIMIZING
THE
CURRENT
STATUSQUO
AND
FOR
OPENING
THE
DOORS
OF
THE
ARAB
MARKETS
FOR
ISRAELI
TRADE
AND
ORANGES
THAT
IS
SIMPLY
UNACCEPTABLE
AND
WOULD
BE
REVOKED
I
LIKE
CALIFORNIA
ORANGES
AND
THE
FEELINGS
MAY
GET
SHARPER
AT
THE
TABLE
