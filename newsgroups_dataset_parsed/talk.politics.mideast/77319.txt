PLEASE
CITE
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
WHERE
AN
ARAB
PARTY
MEMBER
WAS
REJECTED
WHILE
A
JEWISH
PARTY
MEMBER
WAS
ACCEPTED
IF
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THIS
ARTICLE
YOU
WILL
SEE
THAT
I
HAVE
VERY
KINDLY
DUG
UP
ONE
OF
YIGAL
ARENS
PREVIOUS
POSTINGS
ENTIRELY
WITHOUT
HIS
PERMISSION
I
HOPE
HE
DOESNT
MIND
CONTAINING
TRANSLATIONS
FROM
HAAREZT
DETAILING
JUST
SUCH
A
CASE
PERHAPS
YOU
THINK
THAT
HAAREZT
LIES
WOULD
YOU
LIKE
TO
PROVIDE
ME
WITH
AN
ASSURANCE
THAT
THIS
PRACTISE
NEVER
OCCURS
IF
YOU
EXAMINE
THESE
I
AM
SURE
YOU
WILL
DISCOVER
THAT
THE
ARAB
PARTY
MEMBER
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
POWER
BASE
THAT
HIS
JEWISH
COUNTERPART
HAD
RIGHT
ARABS
HAVE
BEEN
VOTING
IN
ISRAEL
FOR
HOW
LONG
AND
IN
ALL
THAT
TIME
NOT
ONE
ARAB
EVER
GAINED
ENOUGH
OF
A
PERSONAL
FOLLOWING
TO
GET
HIS
FELLOW
PARTY
MEMBERS
TO
PUT
IN
A
MINISTRY
THIS
IS
ABOUT
AS
LIKELY
AS
SPROUTING
WINGS
AND
FLYING
TO
RIO
WHAT
BASIS
DO
YOU
HAVE
FOR
EXPLAINING
THIS
ODD
FAILURE
YOU
SEEM
VERY
CONFIDENT
THAT
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
EXACTLY
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHY
ARE
YOU
SURE
ONCE
AGAIN
IF
FOR
ARGUMENTS
SAKE
ALL
THE
ARAB
ISRAELIS
WERE
TO
VOTE
FOR
LABOR
AT
THE
NEXT
ELECTION
YOU
CAN
REST
ASSURED
THAT
THE
NUMBER
OF
ARAB
MKS
AND
CABINET
MEMBERS
WOULD
INCREASE
PROPORTIONATELY
TO
THE
POWER
SHIFT
EXACTLY
WHAT
BASIS
DO
YOU
HAVE
FOR
SAYING
THIS
WHEN
THE
LABOUR
PARTY
HAS
NEVER
PUT
AN
ARAB
INTO
A
CABINET
POST
AND
INSISTS
ITS
COALITION
MEMBERS
DO
THE
SAME
WHY
AND
ON
WHAT
BASIS
ARE
YOU
REASSURING
ME
IN
THE
FACE
OF
YEARS
OF
DISCRIMINATORY
PRACTISE
YOU
ARE
OVERLOOKING
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
WIELD
POLITICAL
POWER
AS
INDIVIDUALS
BASED
UPON
A
WIDER
COLLECTIVE
POWER
BASE
HEY
WHAT
AS
I
SAID
EVEN
WHEN
THEIR
PARTY
PUTS
THEM
UP
THEY
GET
KNOCKED
BACK
IT
SURELY
COULDNT
BE
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
ARABS
IS
IT
THE
REASONING
I
SEE
AT
WORK
IS
PURELY
POLITICAL
AS
FAR
AS
SECURITY
GOES
I
THINK
THAT
SOME
SERIOUS
GAFFS
WERE
MADE
BY
RIGHT
WING
JEWS
AS
WELL
EG
SHARON
WELL
YES
BUT
SECURITY
IS
THE
REASON
MOST
OFTEN
GIVEN
BY
PEOPLE
WHO
WANT
TO
MAKE
EXCUSES
I
MERELY
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
CROP
UP
AND
SO
PREEMPTED
IT
START

RACISM
IN
THE
KNESSET
COALITION
REQUIREMENTS
ON
ONE
HAND
AND
THE
PRESENCE
OF
PROGRESSIVE
MKS
FROM
MERETZ
IN
THE
COALITION
ON
THE
OTHER
HAVE
COMPELLED
RABIN
AND
HIS
FRIENDS
TO
CHANGE
TO
SOME
EXTENT
THEIR
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
THE
ARAB
PUBLIC
AND
THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES
IN
THE
KNESSET
ALTHOUGH
HE
DID
REFUSE
TO
VIEW
THEM
AS
PARTNERS
TAKING
PART
IN
THE
COALITION
AND
JOINING
THE
GOVERNMENT
HE
DID
AGREE
TO
MEET
WITH
THEM
AND
TO
GIVE
THEM
A
DOCUMENT
OF
INTENTIONS
WHICH
INCLUDED
A
COMMITMENT
TO
WORK
TOWARDS
A
DECREASE
IN
THE
DISCRIMINATION
BETWEEN
JEWISH
AND
ARAB
CITIZENS
DECREASE
WHAT
BUT
POSTERS
HAVE
TOLD
US
TIME
AND
AGAIN
THAT
SUCH
DISCRIMINATION
DOES
NOT
EXIST
AT
ALL
IS
RABIN
TOO
A
CLOSET
SELFHATER
YIGAL
HOWEVER
RACISM
HAS
NOT
DISAPPEARED
WHEN
THE
KNESSET
SAT
TO
CONSIDER
WHO
WOULD
STAFF
ITS
VARIOUS
COMMITTEES
A
REQUEST
WAS
MADE
TO
PUT
AN
MK
FROM
HADASH
THE
COMMUNIST
PARTY
ONE
OF
THE
ARAB
PARTIES
YIGAL
ON
THE
STATE
COMPTROLLERS
COMMITTEE
AND
OH
DID
THAT
EVER
STIR
UP
A
STORM
INCLUDING
IN
THE
RANKS
OF
LABOR
SINCE
MANY
KNESSET
MEMBERS
FIND
IT
UNTHINKABLE
THAT
AN
ARAB
MK
SIT
ON
ONE
OF
THE
IMPORTANT
HOUSE
COMMITTEES
SECURITY
SECRETS
ARE
LIABLE
TO
FALL
INTO
THEIR
HANDS
THIS
ATTITUDE
WHICH
UNTIL
RECENTLY
HAD
NOT
EVEN
AROUSED
CRITICISM
BEING
SO
NATURAL
AND
SO
DEEPLYEMBOSSED
UPON
PEOPLES
HEARTS
HOLDS
THAT
THERE
ARE
KNESSET
MEMBERS
WHO
DESPITE
HAVING
BEEN
ELECTED
BY
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
VOTES
ARE
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
BE
FULL
PARTNERS
IN
THE
BODY
WHICH
REPRESENTS
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
WE
ARE
NOT
SPEAKING
HERE
OF
POLITICAL
DISCRIMINATION
WHICH
WOULD
BE
BAD
ENOUGH
IN
ITSELF
BUT
OF
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
THE
PROOF
ONE
OF
THE
COMPROMISES
PROPOSED
WAS
THAT
MK
MAHAMID
AN
ARAB
YIGAL
SHOULD
BE
REPLACED
BY
TAMAR
GOJANSKI
A
JEW
YIGAL
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
MEMBERS
PARTY
WHICH
WAS
CONSIDERED
UNFIT
BUT
HIS
RACE
HERE
IS
A
DOCUMENTED
CASE
IN
A
RESPECTED
ISRAELI
NEWSPAPER
IT
IS
WORTH
NOTING
THAT
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
SINCE
THE
STATES
FOUNDING
A
PUBLIC
DEBATE
HAS
ARISEN
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
AS
WITNESS
THE
FOLLOWING
ARTICLE
A
TEST
OF
SELFCONFIDENCE
BY
GIDON
LEVI
HAARETZ
JULY
REVELATIONS
OF
DISCRIMINATION
AGAINST
ARABS
HAVE
BECOME
SUCH
AN
INTEGRAL
PART
OF
OUR
DAILY
ROUTINE
THAT
THERE
IS
NOT
MUCH
EFFORT
MADE
TO
DEAL
WITH
THEM
DO
YOU
HEAR
THAT
PLEASE
CONTACT
THIS
LEVI
FELLOW
AND
EXPLAIN
TO
HIM
HOW
LITTLE
HE
KNOWS
ABOUT
ISRAEL
PLEASE
YIGAL
EXCEPT
THAT
SOMETIMES
THE
DEMON
BURSTS
OUT
FROM
BEHIND
THE
GOVERNMENTS
WINDOW
DRESSING
AND
THEN
THE
PHENOMENON
IS
SEVEN
TIMES
MORE
SERIOUS
LAST
WEEK
PROVIDED
TWO
MORE
SUCH
EXAMPLES
THE
ISRAELI
KNESSET
IS
FINDING
IT
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
ALLOW
ARAB
REPRESENTATION
ON
ITS
MORE
IMPORTANT
COMMITTEES
AND
ISRAEL
TELEVISION
IS
FINDING
IT
NO
LESS
DIFFICULT
TO
GIVE
A
PLATFORM
TO
ARABS
FROM
THE
TERRITORIES
SEEMINGLY
TWO
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
MATTERS
BUT
IN
FACT
THEY
ARE
ONE
AND
THE
SAME
THE
KNESSET
PROVED
LAST
WEEK
THAT
EVEN
THOUGH
ONE
THIRD
OF
ITS
MEMBERS
ARE
NEW
FACES
IT
HAS
NOT
RENEWED
ITS
OWN
FACE
AT
ALL
AT
LEAST
ON
ONE
ISSUE
PARLIAMENTARY
TRADITIONS
MAY
BE
MODERNIZED
AND
PARLIAMENTARY
TRADITIONS
MAY
BECOME
OBSOLETE
AND
ONLY
ONE
TRADITION
ENDURES
FOREVER
NO
ARAB
SHALL
SET
FOOT
IN
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
COMMITTEES
OF
THE
HOUSE
THERE
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
AND
NEVER
WILL
BE
AN
ARAB
MK
ON
THE
EXTERNAL
AFFAIRS
AND
DEFENSE
COMMITTEE
OR
ON
THE
FINANCE
COMMITTEE
WORLDS
HAVE
BEEN
OVERTURNED
OVER
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
OR
NOT
TO
GIVE
ARABS
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
A
PLACE
ON
THE
STATE
COMPTROLLERS
COMMITTEE
THE
ARGUMENTS
ARE
OLD
AND
WELLKNOWN
IN
ALL
THREE
OF
THE
ABOVE
COMMITTEES
INNUMERABLE
SECRETS
ARE
REVEALED
AND
WOE
UNTO
US
IF
AN
ARAB
SHOULD
HEAR
THEM
ONE
MUST
NOT
MAKE
LIGHT
OF
SUCH
ARGUMENTS
BUT
THEIR
SIGNIFICANCE
SHOULD
ALSO
NOT
BE
EXAGGERATED
EVERY
ARAB
MK
IS
NOT
SPENDING
ALL
HIS
TIME
WAITING
FOR
THE
OPPORTUNE
MOMENT
TO
HAND
OVER
INFORMATION
FROM
THE
KNESSET
COMMITTEE
ROOM
TO
BLACK
PANTHER
HEADQUARTERS
IN
JENIN
AND
NOT
ALL
THE
AFOREMENTIONED
COMMITTEES
ARE
CONTINUALLY
OCCUPIED
IN
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
TOPSECRET
MATTERS
WHICH
COULD
SAFELY
BE
REVEALED
FOR
EXAMPLE
TO
MKS
SUPPORTIVE
OF
THE
JEWISH
UNDERGROUND
BUT
NOT
TO
AN
ARAB
MK
FROM
THE
LIKUD
LABOR
OR
EVEN
FROM
HADASH
THE
ARABS
THEMSELVES
WOULD
PROBABLY
FOREGO
MEMBERSHIP
IN
THE
SUBCOMMITTEE
ON
SECRET
SERVICE
MATTERS
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
ONE
MAY
ASK
IF
MK
NAWAF
MASALHA
WERE
TO
HEAR
GOD
FORBID
A
REVIEW
OF
THE
FOREIGN
MINISTER
IN
AN
OPEN
MEETING
OF
THE
FOREIGN
AFFAIRS
AND
DEFENSE
COMMITTEE
OR
EVEN
A
REVIEW
OF
THE
ARMY
CHIEF
OF
STAFF
WHICH
IN
ANY
CASE
ARE
REGULARLY
LEAKED
TO
THE
NEXT
EDITION
OF
THE
NEWS
AND
WHAT
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
MK
HASHEM
MAHAMID
WERE
TO
REPORT
ON
WHAT
HE
HAD
SEEN
WITH
HIS
OWN
EYES
AT
ALNAJAH
THEIR
NONPARTICIPATION
IN
IMPORTANT
COMMITTEES
AND
THAT
OF
THEIR
COLLEAGUES
CREATES
AN
INTOLERABLE
SITUATION
WHERE
ARAB
MEMBERS
OF
THE
ELECTED
HOUSE
HAVE
ONLY
SEMIPOSITIONS
THEY
ARE
GOOD
ENOUGH
FOR
ADDRESSING
PLENARY
SESSIONS
AND
FOR
VOTING
FOR
OR
AGAINST
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
PARTICIPATING
IN
THE
DELIBERATIONS
OF
THE
IMMIGRATION
AND
ABSORPTION
COMMITTEE
BUT
THEY
MUST
NOT
FOR
EXAMPLE
PARTICIPATE
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
FORMULATING
THE
STATE
BUDGET
IN
THE
FINANCE
COMMITTEE
OR
IN
THE
ALLOCATION
OF
RESOURCES
TO
LOCAL
AUTHORITIES
IN
ANY
CASE
THEY
HAVE
LITTLE
PART
IN
THAT
LABORS
DEPENDENCE
ON
THE
SUPPORT
OF
THE
ARAB
PARTIES
HAS
BROUGHT
ABOUT
SOME
IMPROVEMENT
MK
HASHEM
MAHAMID
WILL
IT
SEEMS
PARTICIPATE
IN
THE
STATE
COMPTROLLERS
COMMITTEE
EARLIER
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
RIDICULOUS
ATTEMPT
MADE
TO
DICTATE
TO
HADASH
WHO
THEIR
REPRESENTATIVE
SHOULD
BE
AND
THUS
TO
PREVENT
THE
ARAB
FROM
ENTERING
THIS
DUBIOUS
HOLYOFHOLIES
BUT
IT
SOON
BECAME
CLEAR
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
LEGAL
OR
CONSTITUTIONAL
BACKING
FOR
SUCH
A
STEP
BUT
NOT
TO
WORRY
EVEN
NOW
THE
JEWISH
MIND
IS
CONTRIVING
DEVICES
THE
NEW
COMMITTEE
CHAIR
RONI
MILO
HAS
ALREADY
ANNOUNCED
THAT
HE
WILL
SET
UP
SUBCOMMITTEES
APLENTY
FOR
HIS
COMMITTEE
THUS
HE
WILL
DECIDE
WHERE
IT
IS
PERMISSIBLE
FOR
MAHAMID
TO
PARTICIPATE
AND
WHERE
NOT
A
SOLUTION
SUCH
AS
THIS
COULD
BY
THE
WAY
ALSO
HAVE
BEEN
ADOPTED
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
COMMITTEES
THEREBY
COMPLETELY
ELIMINATING
THE
FEAR
OF
STATE
SECRETS
BEING
LEAKED
TO
THE
ENEMY
AND
REMOVING
THE
STAIN
OF
DISCRIMINATION
FROM
THE
KNESSET
