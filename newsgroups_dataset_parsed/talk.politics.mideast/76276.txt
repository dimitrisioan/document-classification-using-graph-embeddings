SOME

JOURNALISTS
INTERVIEWING
CELEBRITIES
LIKED
TO
ASK
THEM
WHAT
BOOKS
WOULD
YOU
TAKE
WITH
YOU
IF
YOU
WERE
TO
GO
OFF
ON
A
SPACE
FLIGHT
AND
THOUGH
THE
NUMBER
OF
BOOKS
ALLOWED
ON
THE
TRIP
VARIED
FROM
TO
DEPENDING
ON
THE
TYPE
OF
SPACECRAFT
AND
THE
GENEROSITY
OF
THE
INTERVIEWER
AND
CELEBRITIES
ARE
PEOPLE
OF
THE
MOST
VARIED
TASTES
AGES
AND

NOT
ONE
OF
THEM
DARED
TO
SAY
THAT
HE
OR
SHE
WOULD
WANT
TO
TAKE
WITH
THEM
AT
LEAST
ONE
BOOK
OF
ARITHMETIC
PROBLEMS
SOME
OF
THESE
PEOPLE
CERTAINLY
EXCLUDED
THIS
KIND
OF
LITERATURE
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
TRAINED
IN
THE
HUMANITIES
AND
HAD
NOTHING
BUT
SCORN
FOR
NUMBERS
THOUGH
SECRETLY
AFRAID
OF
THEM
OTHERS
STEERED
CLEAR
OF
SUCH
PUZZLE
BOOKS
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
MASTERS
OF
INCOMPARABLY
MORE
DIFFICULT
BRANCHES
OF
MODERN
MATHEMATICS
AND
DIDNT
MIND
SAYING
FOR
ALL
THE
WORLD
TO
HEAR
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
KNOW
HOW
TO
SOLVE
MERE
ARITHMETIC
PROBLEMS
PROFESSIONAL
MATHEMATICIANS
WERE
NO
EXCEPTION
HERES
WHAT
THE
RUSSIAN
MATHEMATICIAN
ALEXANDER
KHINCHIN
A
SPECIALIST
IN
STATISTICS
WROTE
ABOUT
ARITHMETIC
I
WILLINGLY
CONFESS
THAT
ANY
TIME
A
FIFTHGRADER
ASKED
ME
TO
HELP
SOLVE
AN
ARITHMETIC
PROBLEM
IT
WAS
A
HARD
WORK
FOR
ME
AND
SOMETIMES
I
FAILED
COMPLETELY
OF
COURSE
LIKE
MOST
OF
MY
FRIENDS
I
COULD
EASILY
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
BY
THE
NATURAL
ALGEBRAIC
ROUTE
CONSTRUCTING
EQUATIONS
OR
SETS
OF
EQUATIONS
BUT
WE
WERE
SUPPOSED
TO
AVOID
USING
ALGEBRAIC
ANALYSIS
AT
ALL
COSTS
BY
THE
WAY
ITS
A
FACT
THAT
IS
WELL
KNOWN
AND
OFT
REPEATED
THAT
AS
A
RULE
NEITHER
HIGH
SCHOOL
GRADUATES
NOR
STUDENTS
AT
TEACHING
COLLEGES
NOR
TEACHERS
BEGINNING
THEIR
CAREERS
NOR
I
MUST
ADD
SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCHERS
CAN
SOLVE
ARITHMETIC
PROBLEMS
IT
SEEMS
THE
ONLY
PEOPLE
IN
THE
WORLD
WHO
ARE
ABLE
TO
SOLVE
THEM
ARE
FIFTHGRADE
TEACHERS
NOW
IM
NOT
INSISTING
THAT
A
BOOK
OF
ARITHMETIC
PROBLEMS
BE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
BOOKBAG
OF
ANYONE
FLYING
INTO
SPACE
BUT
A
SENSE
OF
JUSTICE
INDUCES
ME
TO
RECOMMEND
ONE
PARTICULAR
PROBLEM
BOOK
ONE
THAT
WILL
SATISFY
THE
MOST
FASTIDIOUS
TASTE
AND
SUPPLY
FOOD
FOR
THOUGHT
SUFFICIENT
NOT
ONLY
FOR
A
RELATIVELY
SHORT
FLIGHT
TO
THE
MOON
BUT
FOR
A
EXTENDED
SPACE
VOYAGESAY
TO
VENUS
AND
BACK

FOR

THEY
BOTH
TOOK

THEY

AND
SAW
A
BRIGHT
COVER
WITH
A

OF
CUTTHROATS
SHOOTING
AT
EACH
OTHER
WITH

GOD
KNOWS
WHAT
THIS
KIND
OF
STUFF
LEADS
TO

KINGSLEY
THE

LOOKED

THE

FRED
HOYLE
THE
BLACK

THE

IM
TALKING
ABOUT
ISNT
VERY
BIG
BUT
ITS

CONSTITUTE
ELEGANT
MINIATURES
FROM
SEVENTHCENTURY
ARMENIA
NAIVE
AND
WISE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
RICH
IN
STRIKING
DETAIL
AND
THE
BRIGHT

THESE

ARE
REMINISCENT
OF

ON
THE
FAMOUS
MONUMENT
OF
ARMENIAN
ARCHITECTURE
THE
CHURCH
ON
THE
ISLAND
OF
AKHTAMAR
IN

VAN
IN
WHAT
IS

THEY
ARE
AS
INSEPARABLE

INVENTED

FELL
IN

OF

ANANIA

VARDAPET
ANANIA
OF

STANDS
OUT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BREADTH
OF
HIS
INTERESTS
AND
THE
UNIQUE
MATHEMATICAL
ORIENTATION
OF
HIS
WORK
SOME
OF
HIS
WORKS
HAVE
BEEN
PRESERVED
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE

THE

COSMOGRAPHY

AND
ARMENIAN

OF
THE
SEVENTH

THE

OF
THE

WAS

ATTRIBUTED
TO
ANOTHER
OUTSTANDING
THINKER
OF

MOVSES
OF
KHOREN
IN
HIS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY
ANANIA
OF
SHIRAK
HAS
THIS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
HIMSELF
I
ANANIA
OF
SHIRAK
HAVING
STUDIED
ALL
THE
SCIENCE
OF
OUR
ARMENIAN
LAND
AND
HAVING
LEARNED
THE
HOLY
SCRIPTURE
INTIMATELY
IN
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
THE
PSALMIST
EVERY
DAY
I
ILLUMINATED
THE
EYES
OF
MY
MIND
FEELING
MYSELF
LACKING
IN
THE
ART
OF
CALCULATION
I
CAME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
IT
IS
FRUITLESS
TO
STUDY
PHILOSOPHY
THE
MOTHER
OF
ALL
SCIENCES
WITHOUT
NUMBER
I
COULD
FIND
IN
ARMENIA
NEITHER
A
MAN
VERSED
IN
PHILOSOPHY
NOR
BOOKS
THAT
EXPLAINED
THE
SCIENCES
I
THEREFORE
WENT
TO
GREECE
AND
MET
IN
THEODOSIOPLE
A
MAN
NAMED
ILIAZAR
WHO
WAS
WELL
VERSED
IN
ECCLESIASTICAL
WORKS
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
IN
FORTH
ARMENIA
THERE
LIVED
A
FAMOUS
MATHEMATICIAN
CHRISTOSATUR
I
WENT
THIS
PERSON
AND
SPENT
SIX
MONTHS
WITH
HIM
BUT
SOON
I
NOTICED
THAT
CHRISTOSATUR
WAS
A
MASTER
NOT
OF
ALL
SCIENCE
BUT
ONLY
OF
CERTAIN
FRAGMENTARY
FACTS
I
THEN
WENT
TO
CONSTANTINOPLE
WHERE
I
MET
ACQUAINTANCES
WHO
TOLD
ME
WHY
DID
YOU
GO
SO
FAR
WHEN
MUCH
CLOSER
TO
US
IN
TREBIZON
ON
THE
COAST
OF
PONTUS
LIVES
THE
BYZANTINE
VARDAPET
TYUKHIK
HE
IS
FULL
OF
WISDOM
IS
KNOWN
TO
KINGS
AND
KNOWS
ARMENIAN
LITERATURE
I
ASKED
THEM
HOW
THEY
KNEW
THIS
THEY
ANSWERED
WE
SAW
OURSELVES
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
TRAVELED
LONG
DISTANCES
TO
BECOME
PUPILS
OF
SO
LEARNED
A
MAN
INDEED
THE
ARCHDEACON
OF
THE
PATRIARCHATE
OF
CONSTANTINOPLE
PHILAGRUS
TRAVELED
WITH
US
BRINGING
MANY
YOUNG
PERSONS
TO
BECOME
PUPILS
OF
TYUKHIK
WHEN
I
HEARD
THIS
I
EXPRESSED
MY
GRATITUDE
TO
GOD
WHO
HAD
QUENCHED
THE
THIRST
OF
HIS
SLAVE
I
WENT
TO
TYUKHIK
AT
THE
MONASTERY
OF
ST
EUGENE
AND
EXPLAINED
WHY
I
HAD
COME
HE
RECEIVED
ME
GRACIOUSLY
AND
SAID
I
PRAISE
OUR
LORD
THAT
HE
SENT
YOU
TO
LEARN
AND
TO
TRANSPLANT
SCIENCE
IN
THE
DOMAIN
OF
ST
GREGORY
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
ALL
YOUR
COUNTRY
WILL
LEARN
FROM
ME
I
MYSELF
LIVED
IN
ARMENIA
FOR
MANY
YEARS
AS
A
YOUTH
IGNORANCE
REIGNED
THERE
VARDAPET
TYUKHIK
LOVED
ME
AS
A
SON
AND
SHARED
ALL
HIS
THOUGHTS
WITH
ME
THE
LORD
BESTOWED
UPON
ME
HIS
BLESSING
I
COMPLETELY
ASSIMILATED
THE
SCIENCE
OF
NUMBER
AND
WITH
SUCH
SUCCESS
THAT
MY
FELLOW
STUDENTS
AT
THE
KINGS
COURT
BEGAN
TO
ENVY
ME
I
SPENT
EIGHT
YEARS
WITH
TYUKHIK
AND
STUDIED
MANY
BOOKS
THAT
HAD
NOT
BEEN
TRANSLATED
INTO
OUR
LANGUAGE
FOR
THE
VARDAPET
HAD
AN
INNUMERABLE
COLLECTION
OF
BOOKS
SECRET
AND
EXPLICIT
ECCLESIASTICAL
AND
PAGAN
BOOKS
ON
ART
HISTORY
AND
MEDICINE
BOOKS
OF
CHRONOLOGIES
WHY
ENUMERATE
THEM
BY
TITLE
IN
A
WORD
THERE
IS
NO
BOOK
THAT
TYUKHIK
DID
NOT
HAVE
AND
HE
HAD
SUCH
A
GIFT
FROM
THE
HOLY
SPIRIT
FOR
TRANSLATING
THAT
WHEN
HE
SAT
DOWN
TO
TRANSLATE
SOMETHING
FROM
THE
GREEK
INTO
ARMENIAN
HE
DID
NOT
STRUGGLE
AS
OTHER
TRANSLATORS
DID
AND
THE
TRANSLATION
READ
AS
IF
THE
WORK
WERE
WRITTEN
IN
THAT
LANGUAGE
ORIGINALLY
TYUKHIK
TOLD
ME
HOW
HE
HAD
ACHIEVED
SUCH
VAST
ERUDITION
AND
HOW
HE
HAD
LEARNED
THE
ARMENIAN
LANGUAGE
WHEN
I
WAS
YOUNG
HE
SAID
I
LIVED
IN
TREBIZON
AT
THE
COURT
OF
THE
MILITARY
CHIEF
IOANNUS
PATRICUS
AND
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
UP
TO
THE
ACCESSION
OF
MAURITIUS
TO
THE
THRONE
I
SERVED
AS
A
MILITARY
MAN
IN
ARMENIA
AND
LEARNED
YOUR
LANGUAGE
AND
LITERATURE
DURING
ONE
ATTACK
BY
PERSIAN
TROOPS
ON
THE
GREEKS
I
WAS
WOUNDED
AND
ESCAPED
TO
ANTIOCH
I
LOST
ALL
MY
POSSESSIONS
PRAYING
TO
THE
LORD
TO
HEAL
MY
WOUNDS
I
MADE
A
PROMISE
IF
YOU
PROLONG
MY
LIFE
I
SHALL
DEDICATE
IT
NOT
TO
ACCUMULATING
PERISHABLE
TREASURES
BUT
TO
COLLECTING
TREASURES
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
THE
LORD
HEARD
MY
PRAYERS
AFTER
I
RECOVERED
I
WENT
TO
JERUSALEM
AND
FROM
THERE
TO
ALEXANDRIA
AND
ROME
UPON
RETURNING
TO
CONSTANTINOPLE
I
MET
A
FAMOUS
PHILOSOPHER
FROM
ATHENS
AND
STUDIED
WITH
HIM
FOR
MANY
YEARS
AFTER
THAT
I
RETURNED
TO
MY
HOMELAND
AND
BEGAN
TO
TEACH
AND
INSTRUCT
MY
PEOPLE
AFTER
SOME
YEARS
THAT
PHILOSOPHER
DIED
NOT
FINDING
A
REPLACEMENT
FOR
HIM
THE
KING
AND
HIS
COURTIERS
SENT
FOR
TYUKHIK
AND
INVITED
HIM
TO
ASSUME
THE
TEACHERS
POSITION
TYUKHIK
CITING
THE
PROMISE
HE
MADE
TO
GOD
NOT
TO
MOVE
FAR
FROM
THE
CITY
TURNED
DOWN
THE
OFFER
BUT
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
WIDE
LEANING
PEOPLE
CAME
STREAMING
FROM
ALL
COUNTRIES
TO
STUDY
WITH
HIM
AND
I
THE
MOST
INSIGNIFICANT
OF
ALL
ARMENIANS
HAVING
LEARNED
FROM
HIM
THIS
POWERFUL
SCIENCE
DESIRED
BY
KINGS
BROUGHT
IT
TO
OUR
COUNTRY
SUPPORTED
BY
NO
ONE
OBLIGATED
ONLY
TO
MY
OWN
INDUSTRY
GODS
HELP
AND
THE
PRAYERS
OF
THE
BLESSED
EDUCATOR
AND
NO
ONE
THANKED
ME
FOR
MY
EFFORTS
PROBLEMS
AND

A
HALF

BY
ANANIA
OF
SHIRAK
IS
QUITE
AMAZING
THE
MANUSCRIPTS
OF
ANANIAS
BOOK
WERE
PRESERVED
ONLY
BECAUSE
ACCORDING
TO
ARMENIAN
HISTORIANS
IN
ANCIENT
AND
MEDIEVAL
ARMENIA
MANUSCRIPTS
WERE
GUARDED
FROM
INVADERS
LIKE
WEAPONS

AND
SIMPLE
ORBELI
GOES
ON
TO
SAY
THE
SUBJECTS
OF
THE

ARE
GENERALLY
TAKEN
FROM
EVERYDAY
LIFE
THE
SCENE
IS
PREDOMINANTLY
HIS
HOMELAND
SHIRAK

COUNTRYSIDE
AND
THE
DRAMATIS
PERSONAE
IF

ARE
THE

KAMSARAKANS
INCLUDING
NERSEKH
WHO
WAS
A
CONTEMPORARY
OF
ANANIA
LIKE
OTHER
ANCIENT
AUTHORS
ANANIA
OF

USED
ONLY
ALIQUOTS
THAT
IS
FRACTIONS
WITH
A
NUMERATOR
OF
WHEN
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
WRITE
FRACTIONS
WITH

OTHER
THAN

HAS
TO
REPRESENT
IT
AS
A
SUM
OF
ALIQUOTS
SEE
THE
EPIGRAPH
ABOVE
LIKE
ANY
TRUE
WORK
OF

THE
PROBLEMS
OF
ANANIA
SUFFER
TERRIBLY
IN
THE
RETELLING
YOU
HAVE
TO
READ
THE

TOLD
ME
THE
FOLLOWING
STORY
DURING

AND
THE
PERSIANS
PRINCE
ZAURAK
KAMSARAKAN
PERFORMED
EXTRAORDINARY
HEROIC
DEEDS
THREE
TIMES
IN
A

MONTH
HE
ATTACKED
THE
PERSIAN
TROOPS
THE
FIRST
TIME

STRUCK
DOWN
HALF

THE
PERSIANS
WHO
WERE
STILL
ALIVE
NUMBERING
TWO
HUNDRED
EIGHTY
FLED
TO
NAKHICHEVAN
AND
SO
FROM
THIS
REMAINDER
FIND
HOW
MANY
PERSIAN
SOLDIERS
THERE
WERE
BEFORE
THE
MASSACRE
PROBLEM
DURING
THE
FAMOUS
ARMENIAN
UPRISING
AGAINST
THE
PERSIANS
WHEN
ZAURAK
KAMSARAKAN
KILLED

SENT
RIDERS
IN
PURSUIT
TO
BRING
THE
ENVOY
BACK
THE
RIDERS
COVERED
EIGHTY
MILES
IN
A

AND
SO
FIND
HOW
MANY
DAYS
IT
TOOK
THEM
TO
CATCH
THE
ENVOY
PROBLEM
MENTIONS
VESSELS
MADE
OF
VARYING
AMOUNTS
OF
METAL
IN
THE
RUSSIAN
TRANSLATION
THEY
ARE
ALL
CALLED
DISHES
BUT
IN
THE
ORIGINAL
ARMENIAN
ACCORDING
TO
ORBELIS
NOTE
THE
DISHES
IN
THE
FIRST
AND
SECOND
INSTANCES
ARE
CALLED
MESUR
AND
IN
THE
THIRD
INSTANCE
SCUTEL
SCUTEL
IS
A
COMMON
ARMENIAN

BUT
MESUR
HAD
NOT
BEEN
ENCOUNTERED
IN
