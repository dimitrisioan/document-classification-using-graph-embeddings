WRITES
WHILE
I
APPLAUD
INVESTING
OF
MONEY
IN
YEHUDA
SHOMRON
VCHEVELAZZA
IN
ORDER
TO
CREATE
JOBS
FOR
THEIR
RESIDENTS
I
FIND
IT
DEPLORABLE
THAT
THIS
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
AN
ACTIVE
POLICY
OF
ANY
ISRAELI
ADMINISTRATION
SINCE
WITH
REGARD
TO
THEIR
JEWISH
RESIDENTS
PAST
GOVERNMENTS
FOUND
FUNDS
TO
SUBSIDIZE
CHEAP
READ
AFFORDABLE
HOUSING
AND
THE
REQUISITE
INFRASTRUCTURE
BUT
WHERE
WAS
THE
INVESTMENT
FOR
CREATING
INDUSTRY
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
GENERATED
INCOME
AND
JOBS
THE
INVESTMENT
WAS
THERE
IN
THE
FORM
OF
HUGE
TAX
BREAKS
AND
EMPLOYER
BENFITS
YOU
ARE
OVERLOOKING
THE
DIFFERENCE
THAT
THESE
COULD
HAVE
MADE
TO
ANY
COMPANY
PART
OF
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
FEW
INDUSTRIES
WERE
INTERESTED
IN
POLITICAL
SETTLING
AS
MUCH
AS
PROFIT
AFTER
YEARS
YEHUDA
AND
SHOMRON
REMAIN
BARREN
BEREFT
OF
EVEN
MIDDLESIZED
INDUSTRIES
AND
THE
JEWISH
SETTLEMENTS
ARE
STERILE
BEDROOM
COMMUNITIES
HAVENS
FOR
IN
THE
MAIN
ISRAELIS
BOTH
SECULAR
AND
RELIGIOUS
WHO
WORK
IN
TELAVIV
OR
JERUSALEM
BUT
CANNOT
AFFORD
TO
LIVE
IN
EITHER
CITY
OR
THEIR
SURROUNDING
SUBURBS
TRUE
WHICH
LEADS
TO
THE
OBVIOUS
QUESTION
SHOULD
ANY
INVESTMENT
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
THERE
AT
THE
TAXPAYERS
EXPENSE
OBVIOUSLY
THE
ANSWER
WAS
AND
STILL
IS
