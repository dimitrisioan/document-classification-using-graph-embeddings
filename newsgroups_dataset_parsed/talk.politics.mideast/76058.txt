OF
THE
AZERI
TURKS
OF
XSOVIET
ARMENIA
AND
KARABAG
IN
ARTICLE
HENRIKQUAYLEKPCCOM
WRITES
AT
LAST
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
US
INSISTS
THAT
TURKEY
STAY
OUT
OF
THE
KARABAKH
CRISIS
SO
THAT
THE
REPEAT
OF
THE
CYPRUS
INVASION
WILL
NEVER
OCCUR
AGAIN
DO
YOU
HAVE
A
TERMINAL
COLD
KARABAG
IS
TURKISH
AND
WILL
REMAIN
TURKISH
HERE
WE
ARE
ALMOST
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
CENTURY
AND
A
WHOLE
COMMUNITY
THE
AZERI
TURKS
OF
XSOVIET
ARMENIA
AND
KARABAG
IS
FACING
FORCED
ASSIMILATION
TORTURE
AND
MURDER
ON
ONE
HAND
AND
FORCED
EXODUS
EXPULSION
AND
GENOCIDE
ON
THE
OTHER
ALL
BECAUSE
OF
THEIR
ETHNIC
AND
RELIGIOUS
BACKGROUND
AND
ONE
SHOULD
ASK
HERSELF
IS
THE
WORLD
COMMUNITY
REALLY
SO
POWERLESS
WHERE
ARE
ALL
THOSE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
ADVOCATES
WHERE
ARE
ALL
THE
DECENT
PEOPLE
ARE
WE
GOING
TO
LET
THIS
HUMAN
TRAGEDY
GO
ON
AND
DO
NOTHING
ABOUT
IT
THE
NUMBER
OF
AZERIS
MURDERED
BY
THE
TERRORIST
ARMENIAN
ARMY
AND
ITS
SAVAGE
GANGS
IS
INCREASING
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
THEY
WISH
TO
DISTORT
THE
TRUTH
AND
ON
THE
OTHER
THEY
BEG
MERCY
FROM
TURKIYE
THE

THURSDAY
THE
EXACT
NUMBER
OF
VICTIMS
IS
STILL
UNCLEAR
BUT
THERE
CAN
BE
LITTLE
DOUBT
THAT
AZERI
CIVILIANS
WERE
MASSACRED
BY
ARMENIAN
FIGHTERS
IN
THE
SNOWY
MOUNTAINS
OF
NAGORNOKARABAKH
LAST
WEEK
REFUGEES
FROM
THE
ENCLAVE
TOWN
OF
KHOJALY
SHELTERING
IN
THE
AZERI
BORDER
TOWN
OF
AGDAM
GIVE
LARGELY
CONSISTENT
ACCOUNTS
OF
HOW
THEIR
ENEMIES
ATTACKED
THEIR
HOMES
ON
THE
NIGHT
OF
FEBRUARY
CHASED
THOSE
WHO
FLED
AND
SHOT
THEM
IN
THE
SURROUNDING
FORESTS
YESTERDAY
I
SAW
FRESHLY
DUG
GRAVES
IN
ONE
CEMETERY
IN
ADDITION
TO
FOUR
MUTILATED
CORPSES
WE
WERE
SHOWN
IN
THE
MOSQUE
WHEN
WE
ARRIVED
IN
AGDAM
LATE
ON
TUESDAY
I
ALSO
SAW
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
WITH
BULLET
WOUNDS
IN
A
MAKESHIFT
HOSPITAL
IN
A
STRING
OF
RAILWAY
CARRIAGES
KHOJALY
AN
AZERI
SETTLEMENT
IN
THE
ENCLAVE
MOSTLY
POPULATED
BY
ARMENIANS
HAD
A
POPULATION
OF
ABOUT
MR
RASHID
MAMEDOV
COMMANDER
OF
POLICE
IN
AGDAM
SAID
ONLY
ABOUT
ESCAPED
TO
HIS
TOWN
SO
WHERE
ARE
THE
REST
SOME
MIGHT
HAVE
TAKEN
PRISONER
HE
SAID
OR
FLED
MANY
BODIES
WERE
STILL
LYING
IN
THE
MOUNTAINS
BECAUSE
THE
AZERIS
WERE
SHORT
OF
HELICOPTERS
TO
RETRIEVE
THEM
HE
BELIEVED
MORE
THAN
HAD
PERISHED
SOME
OF
COLD
IN
TEMPERATURES
AS
LOW
AS
MINUS
DEGREES
ONE
REFUGEE
RAMI
NASIRU
DESCRIBED
HOW
KHOJALY
RESIDENTS
AT
FIRST
THOUGHT
THE
ATTACK
WAS
NO
MORE
THAN
THE
ROUTINE
SHOOTING
TO
WHICH
THEY
HAD
BECOME
ACCUSTOMED
IN
FOUR
YEARS
OF
CONFLICT
BUT
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THE
ARMENIANS
WITH
A
CONVOY
OF
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIERS
THEY
REALISED
THEY
COULD
NOT
HOPE
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
WITH
MACHINEGUNS
AND
GRENADES
AND
FLED
INTO
THE
FORESTS
IN
THE
SMALL
HOURS
THE
MASSACRE
STARTED
MR
NASIRU
WHO
BELIEVES
HIS
WIFE
AND
TWO
CHILDREN
WERE
TAKEN
PRISONER
REPEATED
WHAT
MANY
OTHER
REFUGEES
HAVE
SAID
THAT
TROOPS
OF
THE
FORMER
SOVIET
ARMY
HELPED
THE
ARMENIANS
TO
ATTACK
KHOJALY
IT
IS
NOT
MY
OPINION
I
SAW
IT
WITH
MY
OWN
EYES
SERDAR
ARGIC
WE
CLOSED
THE
ROADS
AND
MOUNTAIN
PASSES
THAT
MIGHT
SERVE
AS
WAYS
OF
ESCAPE
FOR
THE
TURKS
AND
THEN
PROCEEDED
IN
THE
WORK
OF
EXTERMINATION
OHANUS
APPRESSIAN
IN
SOVIET
ARMENIA
TODAY
THERE
NO
LONGER
EXISTS
