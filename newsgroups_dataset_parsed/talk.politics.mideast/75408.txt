from

at
oclock
being
excused
to
leave
before
the
last
period
in
order
to
go
to
baku
when
we
left
everything
in
town
was
fine
life
was
the
same
as

a
few
groups
of
people
were
discussing
things

and
other
things
then
we
got
on
the
sumgait
bus
bound
for
baku
for
my
first
cousins
birthday
my
father
my
mother
and
i
we
spent
the
day
in
baku
and
on
the
somewhere
around
pm
we
got
on
the
bus
for
home
figuring
that
id
have
enough
time
to
do
my
homework
for
the
next
day
when
we
were
entering
town
near
the
highrises
our
bus
was
stopped
by
a
very
large
crowd
the
crowd
demanded
that
the
armenians
get
off
the
bus
the
driver
says
that
there
are
no
armenians
on
board
then
everyone
on
the
bus
begins
to
shout
that
there
are
no
armenians
on
board
the
group
comes
up
to
the
doors
of
the
bus
and
has
people
get
out
one
by
one
not
checking
passports
just
going
by
the
way
people
look
we
get
off
the
bus
but
are
not
taken
for
armenians
we
set
out
in
the
direction
of
home
at
first
we
were
going
to
go
into
an
old
building
where
we
knew
thered
be
a
place
to
hide
but
the
whole
road
was
packed
with
groups
of
people
all
the
way
from
block
to
the
microdistrict
these
groups
were
emptying
peoples
pockets
and
checking
passports
people
who
didnt
have
passports
with
them
were
beaten
as
well
then
we
decided
to
go
home
instead
near
the
highrises
i
saw
burning
cars
and
a
great
many
people
standing
around
the
driveways
yelling
death
to
the
armenians
was
written
on
the
cars
when
we
came
into
the
courtyardwe
live
in
an
lshaped
buildingit
was
still
quiet
we
went
on
upstairs
but
didnt
turn
on
any
lights
we
tried
to
call
baku
to
warn
our
relatives
who
were
due
to
arrive
on
wednesday
not
to
come
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
our
neighbors
who
advised
us
to
come
down
to
stay
at
their
place
we
went
down
to
their
place
and
they
led
us
to
the
basement
they
live
on
the
first
floor
and
have
a
basement
which
you
enter
across
the
balcony
we
sat
in
the
basement
while
an
armenian
woman
was
beatenshe
ran
away
naked
our
neighbors
daughter
said
that
thats
right
thats
what
the
armenians
deserve
because
in
stepanakert
allegedly
people
were
being
killed
girls
from
agdam
had
been
raped
we
didnt
stay
very
long
in
the
basement
we
tried
to
support
one
another
as
best
we
could
looking
out
the
small
window
with
the
iron
grating
papa
watched
and
said
things
now
and
then
he
said
that
there
was
a
fire
near
building
probably
a
car
on
fire
then
one
of
the
groups
approached
our
driveway
and
demanded
that
they
be
shown
the
apartments
where
armenians
lived
the
neighbors
said
that
there
werent
any
armenians
here
and
the
group
set
out
for
the
other
wing
of
the
building
they
appeared
from
the
side
of
the
building
where
i
later
found
out
a
woman
had
been
murdered
the
woman
who
ran
away
naked
died
yuri
avakian
was
killed
too
when
the
crowd
left
the
neighbors
said
that
it
was
all
over
and
we
could
go
home
we
went
back
up
to
our
place
and
again
didnt
turn
on
the
light
we
started
to
gather
up
our
things
in
order
to
leave
sumgait
for
a
while
we
tried
to
call
a
relative
who
lived
in
sumgait
but
there
was
no
answer
we
decided
she
had
already
left
we
sat
at
home
the
phone
rang
and
the
caller
asked
to
speak
with
my
father
i
called
him
to
the
phone
it
was
jeykhun
mamedov
from
my
fathers
work
brigade
he
said
he
was
disgusted
by
what
was
happening
in
our
town
he
asked
for
our
address
and
promised
to
get
a
car
and
help
us
get
out
of
the
city
to
be
quite
honest
papa
didnt
want
to
give
him
our
address
but
my
mother
got
on
the
phone
and
told
him
some
minutes
after
the
call
a
crowd
ran
into
our
entryway
bursting
into
the
building
they
broke
down
the
door
and
came
into
the
apartment
they
came
straight
to
our
apartment
they
knew
exactly
where
the
armenians
were
they
came
into
our
place
we
tried
to
resist
but
there
was
nothing
we
could
do
one
of
them
took
my
parents
passports
and
began
to
read
them
he
read
the
surname
danielian
turned
the
page
read
armenian
and
that
alone
was
enough
to
doom
us
he
said
that
we
should
be
moved
quickly
out
into
the
courtyard
where
they
would
have
done
with
us
another
standing
next
to
him
pushed
some
of
the
keys
on
the
piano
and
said
your
death
has
tolled
they
had
knives
and
steel
truncheons
i
had
a
knife
in
my
hand
unfortunately
i
didnt
use
it
i
just
knew
that
if
i
didnt
give
up
the
knife
things
would
be
much
worse
they
struck
my
parents
and
said
that
i
should
put
the
knife
on
the
piano
then
one
of
them
commanded
that
we
be
taken
outside
one
person
was
giving
orders
when
we
were
taken
outdoors
i
went
in
the
middle
and
my
mother
was
behind
me
someone
started
to
push
her
so
shed
walk
faster
i
let
her
go
ahead
of
me
and
fell
in
behind
her
when
he
tried
to
push
me
i
hit
him
and
at
that
moment
they
began
beating
my
parents
i
realized
that
resistance
was
completely
useless
we
are
taken
out
into
the
courtyard
and
the
neighbors
are
standing
on
their
balconies
to
see
what
will
happen
next
the
crowd
surrounds
us
at
first
they
strike
me
and
im
knocked
out
when
i
come
to
they
beat
me
again
i
lose
consciousness
often
i
dont
see
or
hear
my
parents
since
i
was
the
first
one
hit
and
was
out
cold
when
i
come
to
i
try
to
pick
them
up
they
are
lying
next
to
me
the
crowd
is
gone
the
only
people
around
are
watching
from
their
balconies
thats
it
i
try
to
pick
them
up
but
cant
my
left
arm
is
broken
i
start
toward
the
drive
wanting
to
tell
the
neighbors
to
call
an
ambulance
the
bodies
of
my
parents
are
still
warm
we
were
attacked
at
around
oclock
i
regain
consciousness
at
about
and
try
to
make
it
up
the
stairs
home
when
i
knock
at
the
neighbors
door
they
push
me
back
and
tell
me
to
go
away
i
go
up
to
the
third
floor
our
neighbor
puts
a
damp
cloth
on
my
head
and
says
she
will
call
an
ambulance
she
sends
her
son
off
for
one
and
takes
me
to
our
apartment
i
often
look
out
the
window
to
see
if
the
ambulance
has
arrived
but
i
cant
see
very
far
as
a
result
of
the
blows
and
it
seems
that
my
parents
have
already
been
taken
away
then
i
calm
down
and
try
to
convince
myself
that
they
have
been
taken
away
and
everything
will
be
ok
but
they
were
still
there
later
at
in
the
morning
as
i
found
out
the
ambulance
picked
them
up
but
they
were
already
dead
if
they
received
attention
on
time
it
is
possible
they
would
still
be
alive
later
around
oclock
on
the
policemen
in
civilian
clothing
come
to
our
house
with
some
assistants
they
call
an
ambulance
and
minutes
later
it
arrives
and
i
am
taken
to
the
sumgait
emergency
hospital
there
they
stitch
the
wounds
on
my
head
and
rebind
my
arm

are
in
the
hospital

sent
by
ambulance
to

nearly
overflowing
with
armenians

found
out
that
my
parents
were

and
bled
profusely
at
the
confrontation
i
met
jeykhun
mamedov
who
had
called
as
it
turned
out
later
he
had
been
the
one
who
tipped
the
crowd
off
he
had
called
specifically
to
find
out
if
we
were
at
home
and
to
find
out
the
exact
address
and
dispatch
the
group
he
knew
the
phone
number
but
didnt
know
the
address
before
the
events
i
had
never
seen
him
but
had
often
spoken
with
him
on
the
phone
when
he
would
ask
to
speak
with
my
father
i
knew
him
by
name
he
denies
that
i
was
the
one
who
answered
the
phone
saying
that
my
father
answered
it
he
denies
that
he
called
from
a
public
phone
saying
that
he
called
from
home
which
also
isnt
true
i
heard
noise
and
the
sounds
of
automobiles
as
i
later
found
out
earlier
he
had
been
convicted
but
had
never
served
any
timehe
had
received
a
suspended
sentence
he
was
about
years
old
i
dont
know
if
he
has
since
confessed
or
not
i
am
sure
that
he
was
the
one
who
tipped
the
crowd
off
onehundred
percent
sure
my
parents
were
from
karabagh
father
was
from
the
village
of
badar
and
was
two
years
old
when
his
family
moved
to
baku
where
his
elder
brothers
were
to
go
to
school
he
was
a
student
at
the
naval
school
but
never
graduated
he
went
off
to
work
on
the
virgin
lands
one
of
the
gigantic
agricultural
projects
instituted
under
khrushchev
when
he
returned
he
lived
in
baku
and
later
moved
to
sumgait
helping
with
the
towns
construction
mamma
was
from
the
village
of
dagdagan
also
from
karabagh
she
worked
in
sumgait
first
in
a
bookstore
and
later
on
a
construction
site
my
sister
is
older
than
i
she
lives
with
her
husband
here
in
karabagh
i
always
loved
my
parents
that
was
why
i
went
on
to
grade
because
it
was
their
dream
that
i
would
continue
my
studies
i
finished
grade
and
wanted
to
enter
the
baku
nautical
school
and
after
that
the
military
school
but
later
i
changed
my
mind
or
rather
my
parents
got
me
to
recon
sider
saying
that
it
would
be
better
to
finish
the
grade
and
then
join
the
naval
school
i
was
planning
to
be
in
the
navy
almost
my
whole
life
longsince
childhood
i
had
dreamed
of
being
a
sailor
my
father
wanted
it
more
than
anything
he
always
recollected
his
youth
telling
of
the
school
and
he
always
said
that
he
had
made
a
big
mistake
in
leaving
it
now
i
live
in
karabagh
and
never
plan
to
leave
here
i
will
stay
at
the
home
of
my
grandfather
of
my
ancestors
till
the
end
of
my
days
while
in
the
hospital
in
baku
i
learned
the
fates
of
many
others
who
had
suffered
as
well
like
ishkhan
trdatov
he
managed
to
hold
them
off
at
their
residence
in
microdistrict
building
apartment
for
a
long
time
lost
his
father
gabriel
and
by
some
miracle
managed
to
survive
i
also
learned
of
uncle
sasha
from
building
whose
daughter
was
raped
besides
them
valeryi
forgot
his
last
namewas
in
the
hospital
too
about
a
year
younger
than
i
he
went
to
school
no
he
was
riding
with
his
parents
in
the
car
people
were
throwing
rocks
at
them
he
was
hit
and
his
parents
brought
him
to
the
hospital
and
he
was
in
our
ward
we
even
came
to
be
friends
before
that
we
had
just
seen
each
other
around
town
but
in
the
hospital
we
got
to
know
one
another
better
i
learned
of
the
fates
of
others
those
who
had
died
or
who
were
befallen
by
misfortune
today
suren
harutunian
the
first
secretary
of
the
communist
party
of
armenia
was
shown
on
television
to
be
honest
i
am
glad
that
armenia
agreed
to
recognize
nagorno
karabagh
as
part
of
the
armenian
soviet
socialist
republic
i
was
repelled
no
revolted
to
hear
the
baku
announcer
who
read
the
decision
of
the
azerbaijani
supreme
soviet
presidium
against
karabagh
becoming
part
of
armenia
after
the
events
in
sumgait
and
those
in
baku
the
best
solution
is
to
give
karabagh
to
armenia
return
it
to
armenia
since
the
people
want
to
live
peacefully
with
the
azerbaijanis
but
everything
has
to
be
right
before
they
can
do
that
i
arrived
in
karabagh
on
april
i
felt
very
bad
i
had
constant
headaches
after
a
while
my
strength
returned
my
older
sister
suzanna
took
me
in
i
think
that
justice
should
prevail
the
people
are
demanding
their
due
you
cant
take
away
what
is
their
due
my
parents
and
i
often
spoke
of
nagorno
karabagh
often
visited
herespent
almost
all
of
my
vacations
here
we
had
even
decided
that
if
karabagh
would
be
made
part
of
armenia
we
would
move
here
for
sure
we
always
said
that
the
armenian
people
had
suffered
much
and
that
what
had
been
done
in
nagorno
karabagh
from
armeniawas
wrong
sooner
or
later
mistakes
should
be
corrected
and
in
order
to
correct
a
mistake
it
must
not
be
repeated
and
the
fate
of
all
nagorno
karabagh
lies
in
the
hands
of
our
government
