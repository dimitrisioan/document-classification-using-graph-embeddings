TO
RESIST
BUT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
WE
COULD

ONE
OF
THEM

AND
BEGAN
TO
READ
THEM
HE
READ
THE
SURNAME

THAT
ALONE
WAS
ENOUGH
TO
DOOM
US
HE
SAID
THAT
WE
SHOULD
BE
MOVED
QUICKLY
OUT
INTO
THE
COURTYARD
WHERE
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
WITH

AND
SAID
YOUR
DEATH

TOLLED
THEY
HAD
KNIVES
AND
STEEL
TRUNCHEONS
I
HAD
A
KNIFE
IN
MY

UNFORTUNATELY
I
DIDNT
USE

I
JUST
KNEW
THAT
IF
I
DIDNT
GIVE
UP
THE
KNIFE
THINGS
WOULD
BE
MUCH
WORSE
THEY
STRUCK
MY
PARENTS
AND
SAID
THAT
I
SHOULD
PUT
THE
KNIFE
ON
THE

THEN
ONE
OF
THEM
COMMANDED
THAT

I
REALIZED
THAT
RESISTANCE
WAS
COMPLETELY
USELESS
WE
ARE

AND
THE
NEIGHBORS
ARE
STANDING
ON
THEIR
BALCONIES
TO
SEE
WHAT
WILL

THATS
IT
I
TRY
TO
PICK
THEM
UP
BUT

START
TOWARD

THE
BODIES
OF
MY
PARENTS
ARE
STILL
WARM
WE
WERE
ATTACKED
AT

HOME
WHEN

AT
THE
NEIGHBORS

AND
SAYS
SHE
WILL
CALL
AN
AMBULANCE
SHE
SENDS
HER
SON
OFF
FOR
ONE
AND
TAKES
ME
TO
OUR
APARTMENT
I
OFTEN
LOOK
OUT
THE
WINDOW
TO
SEE
IF
THE
AMBULANCE
HAS
ARRIVED
BUT
I
CANT
SEE
VERY
FAR
AS
A
RESULT
OF
THE
BLOWS
AND
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MY
PARENTS
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
TAKEN
AWAY
THEN
I
CALM
DOWN
AND
TRY
TO
CONVINCE
MYSELF
THAT
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
TAKEN
AWAY
AND
EVERYTHING
WILL
BE
OK
BUT
THEY
WERE
STILL
THERE
LATER
AT

OUT
THE
AMBULANCE
PICKED
THEM
UP
BUT
THEY
WERE

WITH
HER
HUSBAND
HERE
IN
KARABAGH
I
ALWAYS
LOVED
MY

IT
WAS
THEIR
DREAM
THAT
I
WOULD
CONTINUE
MY
STUDIES
I
FINISHED
GRADE
AND
WANTED
TO
ENTER
THE
BAKU
NAUTICAL

PLANNING
TO
BE
IN
THE
NAVY
ALMOST
MY
WHOLE
LIFE
LONGSINCE
CHILDHOOD
I
HAD
DREAMED
OF
BEING
A
SAILOR
MY
FATHER
WANTED
IT
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
HE
ALWAYS
RECOLLECTED
HIS
YOUTH
TELLING
OF
THE
SCHOOL
AND
HE
ALWAYS
SAID
THAT
HE
HAD
MADE
A
BIG
MISTAKE
IN
LEAVING
IT
NOW
I
LIVE
IN
KARABAGH
AND
NEVER
PLAN
TO
LEAVE
HERE
I
WILL
STAY
AT
THE
HOME
OF
MY
GRANDFATHER
OF
MY
ANCESTORS
TILL
THE
END
OF
MY
DAYS
WHILE
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
IN
BAKU
I
LEARNED
THE
FATES
OF
MANY
OTHERS
WHO
HAD
SUFFERED
AS
WELL
LIKE
ISHKHAN
TRDATOV
HE
MANAGED
TO
HOLD
THEM
OFF
AT
THEIR
RESIDENCE
IN
MICRODISTRICT
BUILDING
APARTMENT
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
LOST
HIS
FATHER
GABRIEL
AND
BY
SOME
MIRACLE
MANAGED
TO
SURVIVE
I
ALSO
LEARNED
OF
UNCLE
SASHA
FROM
BUILDING
WHOSE
DAUGHTER
WAS
RAPED
BESIDES
THEM
VALERYI
FORGOT
HIS
LAST
NAMEWAS
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
TOO
ABOUT
A
YEAR
YOUNGER
THAN
I
HE
WENT
TO
SCHOOL
NO
HE
WAS
RIDING
WITH
HIS
PARENTS
IN
THE
CAR
PEOPLE
WERE
THROWING
ROCKS
AT
THEM
HE
WAS
HIT
AND
HIS
PARENTS
BROUGHT
HIM
TO
THE
HOSPITAL
AND
HE
WAS
IN
OUR
WARD
WE
EVEN
CAME
TO
BE
FRIENDS
BEFORE
THAT
WE
HAD
JUST
SEEN
EACH
OTHER
AROUND
TOWN
BUT
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
WE
GOT
TO
KNOW
ONE
ANOTHER
BETTER
I
LEARNED
OF
THE
FATES
OF
OTHERS
THOSE
WHO
HAD
DIED
OR
WHO
WERE
BEFALLEN
BY
MISFORTUNE
TODAY
SUREN
HARUTUNIAN
THE
FIRST
SECRETARY
OF
THE
COMMUNIST
PARTY
OF
ARMENIA
WAS
SHOWN
ON
TELEVISION
TO
BE
HONEST
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
ARMENIA
AGREED
TO
RECOGNIZE
NAGORNO
KARABAGH
AS
PART
OF
THE
ARMENIAN
SOVIET
SOCIALIST
REPUBLIC
I
WAS
REPELLED
NO
REVOLTED
TO
HEAR
THE
BAKU
ANNOUNCER
WHO
READ
THE
DECISION
OF
THE
AZERBAIJANI
SUPREME
SOVIET
PRESIDIUM
AGAINST
KARABAGH
BECOMING
PART
OF
ARMENIA
AFTER
THE
EVENTS
IN
SUMGAIT
AND
THOSE
IN
BAKU
THE
BEST
SOLUTION
IS
TO
GIVE
KARABAGH
TO
ARMENIA
RETURN
IT
TO
ARMENIA
SINCE
THE
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
LIVE
PEACEFULLY
WITH
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
BUT
EVERYTHING
HAS
TO
BE
RIGHT
BEFORE
THEY
CAN
DO
THAT
I
ARRIVED
IN
KARABAGH
ON
APRIL
I
FELT
VERY
BAD
I
HAD
CONSTANT
HEADACHES
AFTER
A
WHILE
MY
STRENGTH
RETURNED
MY
OLDER
SISTER
SUZANNA
TOOK
ME
IN
I
THINK
THAT
JUSTICE
SHOULD
PREVAIL
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
DEMANDING
THEIR
DUE
YOU
CANT
TAKE
AWAY
WHAT
IS
THEIR
DUE
MY
PARENTS
AND
I
OFTEN
SPOKE
OF
NAGORNO
KARABAGH
OFTEN
VISITED
HERESPENT
ALMOST
ALL
OF
MY
VACATIONS
HERE
WE
HAD
EVEN
DECIDED
THAT
IF
KARABAGH
WOULD
BE
MADE
PART
OF
ARMENIA
WE
WOULD
MOVE
HERE
FOR
SURE
WE
ALWAYS
SAID
THAT
THE
ARMENIAN
PEOPLE
HAD
SUFFERED
MUCH
AND
THAT
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
DONE
IN
NAGORNO
KARABAGH
FROM
ARMENIAWAS
WRONG
SOONER
OR
LATER
MISTAKES
SHOULD
BE
CORRECTED
AND
IN

TO
CORRECT
A
