THAT
ACCORDING

VOCABULARY

THE

IN
NO

IT
WOULD
THUS
APPEAR
THAT

IS
A

THAT

IS
THE

OF
THE

WHO
LIVED
THERE
AND
THAT
THESE
ARE
IN
NO

CONNECTED

ARMENIAN
HISTORIANS
BELIEVE
HAIK
TO
HAVE
BEEN
A
GREAT
HERO
FROM
WHOM
THE
ARMENIAN
PEOPLE
TOOK
THE

HAI
BUT
THE
MERE
RESEMBLANCE
BETWEEN
THE

CONSTITUTES
NO
REAL
PROOF
AND
IN
ANY
CASE
NO
SUCH
THEORY
APPEARS
BEFORE
THE

OF

OF
KHOREN
HAIASA
THE
FOLLOWING
STUDIES
SHOW
QUITE
CLEARLY
THAT
HAI
AND
HAIASA
WERE
NO
MORE
THAN
GENERAL
NAMES
USED
BY
THE
HITTITES
TO
REFER
TO
THE

KNOWN
AS

TO

THAT

THAT

IS
A

PROVED
THIS
ERRONEOUS

THERE
IS
NO
POINT
IN
EVEN
MENTIONING
IT
THE
RESEMBLANCE
BETWEEN
THE

HAIASA
AND

IS
SO
OBVIOUS
THAT
WE
MAY
WELL
ACCEPT
HAIASA
AS
THE
OLDEST
FORM
OF

LET
US
NOW
CAST
A
BRIEF
GLANCE
ON
HOW
THE
WORDS
HAI
HAIKAZAN
AND
HAIASTAN
ENTERED
OUR
OLDER
WORKS
ACCORDING
TO
KARAKASHIAN
THE
WORD
HAIK
IS
NEVER
TO
BE
FOUND
EMPLOYED
WITH
REFERENCE
TO
A
LEADER
OF
THE
ARMENIAN

PRIOR
TO

IS
IT
EVER

EMPLOYED

IF
THE
WORD
HAD
REFERRED
TO
A
NATION
AND
HAD
BEEN
DERIVED
FROM
HAI

HAIK
THEY
COULD
ALSO
HAVE
USED
THE
WORDS
HAIKAK

IN
A
NUMBER
OF
PLACES

UNSATISFACTORY

HOWEVER
THAT
A
SOLUTION
TO
THIS

IS
BROUGHT
NEARER
BY

FREQUENTLY

AS

IN
THAT
CASE
IT
SEEMS
LIKELY
THAT
HAIASA
WAS
ACTUALLY
A
PART
OF

THE
SUFFIX
DAN
IS
OF
ANATOLIAN

THE
