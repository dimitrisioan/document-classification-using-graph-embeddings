organization
by
trying
to
distribute
nazi
propaganda
furthermore
you
attempt
to
rationalize
this
through
crude
stereotyping
by
pointing
to
the
wtc
bombing
in
which
arabamericans
had
no
involvement
huh
mohamed
salimeh
was
perhaps
a
korean
how
do
you
claim
arabamericans
had
no
involvement
in
the
wtc
bombing
ok
his
involvement
is
alleged
by
the
fbi
which
doesnt
seem
to
reliable
these
days
but
honestly
there
is
a
pile
of
evidence
pointing
to
them
and
it
seems
those
were
involved
this
does
not
mean
that
all
arabamericans
were
involved
nor
should
they
be
blamed
for
it
but
denying
that
there
were
some
arabamericans
involved
sounds
sorta
silly
to
me
adam
i
dont
think
any
of
the
suspects
were
americans
consequently
they
could
not
be
arabamericans
