REGARDING

CERTAIN
MOSLEM
FAMILIES
AND
RECEIVED
AS
SERVANTS
WHEN
THEY
ARE
LEFT
ALONE
THROUGH
THE
DEATH
OF
THEIR
PARENTS
WE
INFORM
YOU
THAT
YOU
ARE
TO
COLLECT
ALL
SUCH
CHILDREN
IN
YOUR
PROVINCE
AND
SEND
THEM
TO
THE
PLACES
OF
DEPORTATION
AND
ALSO
TO
GIVE
THE
NECESSARY
ORDERS
REGARDING
THIS
TO
THE
PEOPLE
MINISTER
OF
THE
INTERIOR
TALAAT
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
ALEPPO
SEPTEMBER
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
FOR
AN
ORPHANAGE
IT
IS
NOT
THE
TIME
TO
GIVE
WAY
TO
SENTIMENT
AND
FEED
THE
ORPHANS
PROLONGING
THEIR
LIVES
SEND
THEM
AWAY
TO
THE
DESERT
AND
INFORM
US
MINISTER

THE
INTERIOR
TALAAT
TO
THE
GENERAL
COMMITTEE
FOR
SETTLING
AND
DEPORTEES
NOVEMBER
THERE
WERE
MORE
THAN
FOUR
HUNDRED

IN
THE
ORPHANAGE
THEY
WILL
BE
ADDED
TO
THE
CARAVANS
AND
SENT
TO
THEIR
PLACES
OF
EXILE
ABDULLAHAD
NURI
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
ALEPPO
JANUARY
WE
HEAR
THAT
CERTAIN
ORPHANAGES
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
OPENED
RECEIVE
ALSO
THE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
WHETHER
THIS
IS
DONE
THROUGH
THE
IGNORANCE
OF
OUR
REAL
PURPOSE
OR
THROUGH
CONTEMPT
OF
IT
THE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
REGARD
THE
FEEDING
OF
SUCH
CHILDREN
OR
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
PROLONG
THEIR
LIVES
AS
AN
ACT
ENTIRELY
OPPOSED
TO
IT
PURPOSE
SINCE
IT
CONSIDERS
THE
SURVIVAL
OF
THESE
CHILDREN
AS
DETRIMENTAL
I
RECOMMEND
THAT
SUCH
CHILDREN
SHALL
NOT
BE
RECEIVED
INTO
THE
ORPHANAGES
AND
NO
ATTEMPTS
ARE
TO
BE
MADE
TO
ESTABLISH
SPECIAL
ORPHANAGES
FOR

MINISTER

TALAAT
TO
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF

COLLECT
AND
KEEP
ONLY
THOSE
ORPHANS
WHO
CANNOT
REMEMBER
THE
TORTURES

WHICH
THEIR

HAVE
BEEN
SUBJECTED
SEND

THOUSANDS
OF
MOSLEM
REFUGEES
AND
THE
WIDOWS
OF
SHEKID
FALLEN
SOLDIERS
ARE
IN
NEED
OF
FOOD
AND
PROTECTION
IT
IS
NOT
EXPEDIENT
TO
INCUR
EXTRA
EXPENSES
BY
FEEDING
THE
CHILDREN
LEFT
BY
ARMENIANS
WHO
WILL
SERVE
NO
PURPOSE
EXCEPT
THAT
OF
GIVING
TROUBLE
IN
THE
FUTURE
IT
IS
NECESSARY
THAT
THESE
CHILDREN
SHOULD
BE
TURNED
OUT
OF
YOUR
VILAYET
AND
SENT
WITH
THE
CARAVANS
TO
THE
PLACE
OF
DEPORTATION
THOSE
