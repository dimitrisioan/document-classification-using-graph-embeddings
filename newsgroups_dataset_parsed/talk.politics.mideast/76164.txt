TIM
CLOCK
WRITES
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
WHEN
GUERILLAS
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ISRAEL
SHOULD
TOTALLY
BACK
DOWN
SOTHE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
ATTACKING
ANOTHER
IS
TO
USE
AN
INNOCENT
AS
A
SHIELD
AND
HOPE
THAT
THE
OTHER
RESPECTS
INNOCENT
LIVES
TELL
ME
TIM
WHAT
ARE
THESE
GUERILLAS
DOING
WRONG
ASSUMING
THAT
THEY
ARE
USING
CIVILIANS
FOR
COVER
ASSUMING
ALSO
COME
ON
BRAD
IF
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
GET
ANYWHERE
IN
THIS
OR
ANY
DISCUSSION
IT
DOESNT
HELP
TO
BRING
UP
ELEMENTS
I
NEVER
ADDRESSED
NOR
COMMENTED
ON
IN
ANY
WAY
I
MADE
NO
COMMENT
ON
WHO
IS
RIGHT
OR
WHO
IS
WRONG
ONLY
THAT
CIVILIANS
ARE
BEING
USED
AS
COVER
AND
THAT
HAVING
BEEN
PLACED
IN
BETWEEN
THE
ISRAELIS
AND
THE
GUERILLAS
THEY
WILL
BE
INJURED
AS
BOTH
PARTIES
CONTINUE
THEIR
FIGHT
THE
PURPOSE
OF
AN
ARMYS
USE
OF
MILITARY
UNIFORMS
IS
TO
SET
ITS
MEMBERS
APART
FROM
THE
CIVILIANS
SO
THAT
CIVILIANS
WILL
NOT
BE
THOUGHT
OF
BY
THE
OTHER
SIDE
AS
COMBATANTS
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
IS
THE
MEANING
BEHIND
THE
INTENTION
AND
THE
EFFECT
WHEN
AN
ARMY
PURPOSELY
DOES
NOT
WERE
UNIFORMS
BUT
GOES
OUT
OF
ITS
WAY
TO
LOOK
LIKE
CIVILIANS
THEY
ARE
JUDGING
THAT
THE
BENEFIT
THEY
WILL
RECEIVE
FROM
THIS
COVER
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAT
THE
HARM
THAT
WILL
COME
TO
CIVILIANS
THIS
IS
A
COMMENT
ON
THE
ISRAELI
EXPERIENCE
AND
IS
SAYING
THAT
THE
GUERILLAS
DO
HAVE
SOME
RESPONSIBILITY
IN
PUTTING
CIVILIANS
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
THIS
FIGHT
BY
PUTTING
ON
UNIFORMS
AND
LIVING
APART
FROM
CIVILIANS
BARRACKS
ETC
THE
GUERILLAS
WOULD
SIGNIFICANTLY
LOWER
THE
RISK
TO
CIVILIANS
BUT
IF
THE
GUERILLAS
DO
THIS
ARENT
THEY
PUTTING
THEMSELVES
AT
GREATER
RISK
ABSOLUTELY
THEY
ASK
THEMSELVES
WHY
SET
OURSELVES
APART
BY
WEARING
UNIFORMS
WHEN
THERE
IS
A
READYMADE
COVER
FOR
US
CIVILIANS
THAT
MAKES
SENSE
FROM
THEIR
POINT
OF
VIEW
BUT
WHEN
THIS
COVER
IS
USED
THE
GUERILLAS
SHOULD
ACCEPT
SOME
OF
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
SUBSEQUENT
HARM
TO
CIVILIANS
IF
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
IS
TO
PREVENT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
IS
IT
NOT
WORKING
WHY
IS
IT
FURTHER
NECCESSARY
FOR
ISRAELI
GUNS
TO
POUND
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
WHY
NOT
JUST
KILL
THOSE
WHO
TRY
TO
INFILTRATE
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
YOU
SEE
THERE
IS
MORE
TO
THE
SHELLING
OF
THE
VILLAGES
IT
IS
CALLED
RETALIATION
GETTING
BACKGETTING
EVEN
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
SHELL
THE
VILLAGES
THE
LEAST
IT
SHOWS
IS
A
RECKLESS
DISREGARD
BY
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
FOR
THE
LIVES
OF
CIVILIANS
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
ISRAELS
BOMBING
SORTEES
AND
BOMBING
POLICY
IS
STUPID
THOUGHTLESS
INHUMANE
AND
INEFFECTIVE
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
THAT
ISRAEL
SHOULD
PASSIVE
WAIT
UNTIL
ATTACKERS
CHOSE
TO
ACT
THERE
IS
EVERY
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
TAKING
THE
FIGHT
TO
THE
ENEMY
WILL
DO
MORE
TO
STOP
ATTACKS
AS
I
SAID
PREVIOUSLY
ISRAEL
SPENT
SEVERAL
DECADES
SITTING
PASSIVELY
ON
ITS
SIDE
OF
A
BORDER
AND
ONLY
ACTING
TO
STOP
THESE
ATTACKS
AFTER
THE
ATTACKERS
HAD
ENTERED
ISRAELI
TERRITORY
IT
DIDNT
WORK
VERY
WELL
THE
HOST
ARAB
STATE
DID
LITTLENOTHING
TO
TRY
AND
STOP
THESE
ATTACKS
FROM
ITS
SIDE
OF
THE
BORDER
WITH
ISRAEL
SO
THE
NUMBER
OF
ATTACKS
WERE
CONSIDERABLY
HIGHER
AS
WAS
THEIR
PHYSICAL
AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL
IMPACT
ON
THE
CIVILIANS
CAUGHT
IN
THEIR
PATH
WHATSO
THE
WHOLE
BIT
ABOUT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
NEIGHBORING
ARAB
STATES
CAN
START
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
WHILE
I
ALSO
HOPE
FOR
THIS
TO
HAPPEN
IT
WILL
ONLY
OCCUR
WHEN
ARAB
STATES
SHOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
PREPARED
TO
TAKE
ON
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
THE
DUTY
TO
STOP
GUERILLA
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
THEIR
SOIL
THEY
HAVE
TO
PROVE
IT
OR
PROVIDE
SOME
GUARATEES
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
ISRAEL
IS
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
THEIR
WORD
NOT
WITH
THEIR
PAST
ATTITUDE
OF
TOLERANCE
TOWARDS
ANTIISRAEL
GUERILLAS
INRESIDENCE
IF
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
OTHERS
THEN
IMHO
IT
HAS
NO
BUSINESS
WASTING
OTHERS
TIME
COMING
TO
THE
PEACE
TALKS
THIS
IS
JUST
ANOTHER
SELECTIVELY
APPLIED
STATEMENT
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
DRAWNOUT
IMPASSE
BETWEEN
ABABSPALESTINIANS
AND
ISRAELIS
IS
THAT
NEITHER
SIDE
IS
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
THE
OTHER
BY
YOUR
CRITERIA
EVERYONE
SHOULD
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THE
NEGOTIATIONS
THAT
IS
PRECISELY
WHY
THE
PALESTINIANS
IN
THEIR
RECENT
PISGA
PROPOSAL
FOR
THE
INTERIM
PERIOD
AFTER
NEGOTIATIONS
AND
LEADING
UP
TO
FULL
AUTONOMY
ARE
DEMANDING
CONDITIONS
THAT
ESSENTIALLY
DEFINE
AUTONOMY
ALREADY
THEY
DO
NOT
TRUST
THAT
ISRAEL
WILL
FOLLOW
THROUGH
THE
ENTIRE
PROCESS
AND
ALLOW
PALESTINIANS
TO
REACH
FULL
AUTONOMY
DO
YOU
UNDERSTAND
AND
ACCEPT
THIS
VIEWPOINT
BY
THE
PALESTINIANS
IF
YOU
DO
THEN
WHY
SHOULD
ISRAELS
VIEW
OF
ARABSPALESTINIANS
BE
ANY
DIFFERENT
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
TRUST
THE
ARABPALESTINIANS
WORDS
SINCE
THEY
DONT
THEY
ARE
VERY
RELUCTANT
TO
GIVE
UP
TANGIBLE
ASSETS
LAND
CONTROL
OF
AREAS
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
WORDS
FOR
THIS
REASON
THEY
ARE
ALSO
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
SORTS
OF
GUARANTEES
THEY
WILL
HAVE
THAT
THE
ARABS
WILL
FOLLOW
THROUGH
ON
THEIR
PART
OF
ANY
AGREEMENT
REACHED
BUT
DONT
YOU
SEE
THAT
THE
SAME
STATEMENT
CAN
BE
MADE
BOTH
WAYS
IF
LEBANON
WAS
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
THEN
IT
SHOULD
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
ISRAEL
THAT
THE
ATTACKS
WERE
THE
CAUSE
FOR
WAR
AND
DISARMING
THE
HIZBOLLAH
WILL
REMOVE
THE
CAUSE
FOR
ITS
CONTINUED
OCCUPANCY
ABSOLUTELY
SO
ARE
THE
ARABSPALESTINIANS
ASKING
FIRST
FOR
THE
ISRAELIS
WORD
IN
RELATION
TO
ANY
AGREEMENT
NO
WHAT
IS
BEING
DEMANDED
FIRST
IS
LAND
WHEN
THE
ISSUE
IS
LAND
AND
ONE
PARTY
FINALLY
GETS
HOLD
OF
THIS
LAND
WHAT
THE
OTHER
PARTY
DOES
IS
TOTALLY
IRRELEVENT
IF
I
NOW
HAVE
POSSESSION
OF
THIS
LAND
YOUR
WORDS
HAVE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
POWER
WHETHER
ISRAEL
CHOOSES
TO
KEEPS
ITS
WORD
DOES
NOT
GET
THE
LAND
BACK
AFTERALL
ISRAEL
HAS
ALREADY
STAGED
TWO
PARTS
OF
THE
WITHDRAWAL
FROM
AREAS
IT
OCCUPIED
IN
LEBANON
DURING
SLG
TIM
YOU
ARE
IGNORING
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PALESTINIANS
IN
LEBANON
HAVE
BEEN
DISARMED
HEZBOLLAH
REMAINS
THE
ONLY
INDEPENDENT
MILITIA
HEZBOLLAH
DOES
NOT
ATTACK
ISRAEL
EXCEPT
AT
A
FEW
TIMES
SUCH
AS
WHEN
THE
IDF
BURNED
UP
SHEIKH
MOSAVI
HIS
WIFE
AND
YOUNG
SON
WHILE
THE
MAJOR
ARMAMENTS
THOSE
ALLOWING
PEOPLE
TO
WAGE
CIVIL
WARS
HAVE
BEEN
REMOVED
THE
WEAPONS
NEEDED
TO
CROSSBORDER
ATTACKS
STILL
REMAIN
TO
SOME
EXTENT
ROCKET
ATTACKS
STILL
CONTINUE
AND
COMMANDO
RAIDS
ONLY
REQUIRE
A
FEW
EASILY
CONCEALED
WEAPONS
AND
A
REFINED
DISREGARD
FOR
HUMAN
LIFE
YOURS
OF
THAT
OF
OTHERS
SUCH
ATTACKS
ALSO
CONTINUE
OF
COURSE
IF
ISRAEL
WOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
LEBANON
AND
STOP
ASSASSINATING
PEOPLE
AND
SHELLING
VILLAGES
THEY
WOULDNT
MAKE
THE
LEBANESE
SO
MAD
AS
TO
DO
THAT
BAT
GUANO
THE
SITUATION
YOU
CALL
FOR
EXISTED
IN
THE
AND
ATTACKS
WERE
COMMONPLACE
FURTHERMORE
WITH
HEZBOLLAH
SUBSEQUENTLY
DISARMED
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
POSSIBLE
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
THESE
GROUPS
CAN
BE
EFFECTIVELY
DISARMED
UNLESS
THE
STATE
IS
AS
AUTHORITARIAN
IS
SYRIAS
THE
ONLY
OTHER
WAY
IS
FOR
LEBANON
TO
TAKE
IT
UPON
ITSELF
TO
CONSTANTLY
PATROL
THE
ENTIRE
BORDER
WITH
ISRAEL
ESSENTIALLY
MIRRORING
ISRAELS
BORDER
SECIRITY
ON
ITS
SIDE
IT
HAS
TO
PROVE
TO
ISREAL
THAT
IT
IS
THIS
COMMITTED
TO
PROTECTING
ISRAEL
FROM
ATTACK
FROM
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
ONCE
SYRIA
LEAVES
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
LEBANON
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
RETAIN
CONTROL
IF
SYRIA
STAYS
THAY
MAY
BE
EVEN
MORE
DANGEROUS
FOR
ISRAEL
TIM
WHEN
IS
THE
LAST
TIME
THAT
YOU
RECALL
ANY
TROUBLE
ON
THE
SYRIAN
BORDER
NOT
LATELY
EH
THATS
WHAT
I
SAID
OK
BUT
DOESNT
THAT
MEAN
THAT
SYRIA
HAS
TO
TAKE
OVER
LEBANON
I
DONT
THINK
ISRAEL
OR
LEBANON
WOULD
LIKE
THAT
WHAT
BOTH
SIDES
NEED
IS
TO
RECEIVE
SOMETHING
TANGIBLE
THE
ARABS
PALESTINIANS
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
LAND
AND
DEMANDING
THAT
THEY
RECEIVE
IT
PRIOR
TO
GIVING
ANYTHING
TO
ISRAEL
ISRAEL
HAS
TWO
PROBLEMS
IF
IT
GIVES
UP
REAL
LAND
IT
IS
EXPOSING
ITSELF
TO
A
CHANGED
GEOSTRATEGIC
SITUATION
AND
THAT
CHANGE
DOESNT
HELP
ISRAELS
POSITION
AND
WHEN
IT
GIVES
UP
THIS
LAND
IT
NEEDS
TO
RECEIVE
SOMETHING
IN
RETURN
TO
COMPENSATE
FOR
THE
INCREASED
RISKS
TIM
