JIM
EGGERT
WRITES
NOT
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
BUT
REMINISCENT
OF
THE
ASSASSINATION
OF
COUNT
BERNADOTTE
WHO
WAS
THE
UN
NEGOTIATOR
DURING
THE
ISRAELI
WAR
OF
INDEPENDENCE
HE
WAS
KILLED
BY
THE
ISRAELIS
SEEMS
HE
WAS
BEING
TOO
SUCCESSFUL
IN
NEGOTIATING
A
CEASEFIRE
WHICH
WOULD
HAVE
WORKED
TERRITORIALLY
AGAINST
THE
NASCENT
ISRAEL
COMPARED
TO
CONTINUED
WAR
THAT
OPERATION
WAS
DONE
BY
A
SMALL
JEWISH
FRACTION
BEFORE
THE
STATE
EVEN
EXISTED
AND
AS
FAR
AS
I
REMEMBER
WAS
DISAPROVED
BY
MOST
OF
THE
JEWS
SAYING
THAT
HE
WAS
KILLED
BY
THE
ISRAELIS
IS
PLAIN
WRONG
BECAUSE
THERE
WASNT
ISRAEL
AT
THE
TIME
AND
AS
FAR
AS
THE
JEWS
LIKED
THE
IDEA
OF
HAVING
PART
OF
THE
LAND
YOU
CAN
SEE
THEIR
REACTION
TO
THE
UN
RESOLUTION
FROM
NOVEMBER
AND
THE
ARABS
REACTION
TOO
NO
IT
WASNT
THAT
THE
ARABS
DANCED
IN
THE
STREETS
WITH
DOZNES
OF
JEWISH
STATES
INVADING
THEM
BUT
QUITE
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
BYE
AMOS
SHAPIRA
JUMPER
EXTRAORDINAIRE
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
POWER
CORRUPTS
CS
SYSTEM
GROUP
HEBREW
UNIVERSITY
BUT
ABSOLUTE
POWER
IS
BETTER
JERUSALEM
ISRAEL
