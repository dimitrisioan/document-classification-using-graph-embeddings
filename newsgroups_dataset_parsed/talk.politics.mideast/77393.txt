my
conversation
although
the
administrative
mechanism
was
a
strictly
centralized
one
the
ottoman
empire
was
a
classical
example
of
a
pluralist
social
order
the
millet
system
was
the
mechanism
which
shaped
the
social
order
of
the
multinational
ottoman
empire
and
stood
behind
its
continuity
as
a
matter
of
fact
because
islamic
principles
were
in
force
in
the
ottoman
empire
it
was
natural
to
use
religious
criteria
to
differentiate
among
the
various
communities
which
constituted
the
empire
the
millet
system
began
to
be
based
on
ethnicity
in
the
century
under
the
influence
of
nationalism
