i
am
sick
and
tired
of
this
driving
the
jews
into
the
sea
sentance
attributed
to
islamic
movements
and
the
plo
it
simply
cant
be
proven
as
part
of
their
plan
ok
ill
admit
it
i
cant
find
a
quote
with
my
meager
online
resources
but
i
did
find
this
little
gem
when
the
arabs
set
off
their
volcano
there
will
only
be
arabs
in
this
part
of
the
world
our
people
will
continue
to
fuel
the
torch
of
the
revolution
with
rivers
of
blood
until
the
whole
of
the
occupied
homeland
is
liberated
yasser

ap
so
ahmed
is
right
there
was
nothing
about
driving
jews
into
the
sea
just
a
bit
of
ethnic
cleansing
and
a
river
of
blood
is
this
an
improvement

if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual
favors
we
sure
wouldnt
waste
them
on
members
