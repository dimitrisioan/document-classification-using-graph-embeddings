ar
western
readers
have
learned
of
the
nagorno
upper
karabakh
ar
controversy
through
reports
from
that
remote
area
by
western
ar
correspondents
and
from
commentaries
by
member
of
the
longestablished
ar
armenianamerican
community
azeri
views
on
this
dispute
have
ar
appeared
rarely
if
at
all
in
the
western
news
media
therefore
let
me
ar
present
washington
report
readers
with
some
basic
truths
about
the
ar
origins
of
the
conflict
during
the
past
two
years
if
one
reads
all
the
commentaries
on
the
subject
a
small
minority
of
the
writers
have
been
armenia
or
azeri
the
following
should
be
interesting
ar
armenian
leaders
claim
that
azerbaijan
was
the
first
to
oppress
and
ar
expel
the
armenian
minority
from
the
azerbaijani
republic
actually
ar
the
initiative
to
banish
the
azeri
minority
and
convert
the
armenian
ar
republic
into
a
homogeneous
state
began
in
the
winter
of
ar
when
azeris
were
driven
out
of
armenia
following
that
move
ar
there
were
massacres
of
armenians
in
the
azerbaijani
cities
of
sumgait
arin
february
and
two
years
later
in
baku
in
january
this
not
true
other
than
simply
checking
the
newspapers
i
will
quote
from
an
independent
human
rights
report
in
the
pax
cristi
netherlands
september
page
we
read
by
midnovember
many
incidents
took
place
in
several
places
in
azerbaijan
the
apf
azeri
popular
front
challenged
the
communist
party
for
power
after
ten
days
the
authorities
came
in
with
tanks
to
reimpose
their
power
in
nakhitchevan
the
last
armenian
villages
were
deported
in
ganja
armenians
were
attacked
and
killed
all
armenian
inhabitants
fled
the
city
between
november
and
december
refugees
from
ganja
arrived
in
armenia
while
all
azeris
in
armenia
were
chased
away
in
this
part
of
the
world
february
start
of
organized
antiarmenian
pogroms
in
azerbaijan
come
before
november
and
december
of
ar
azeri
parliamentary
committees
have
compiled
evidence
indicating
that
ar
both
events
were
inspired
from
moscow
to
secure
russian
imperial
rule
ar
in
the
transcaucasus
according
to
the
roman
principle
of
divide
and
ar
rule
similar
conspiracies
are
evident
throughout
the
fiveyear
ar
history
of
the
conflict
it
is
interesting
that
the
azeris
killed
burnt
raped
the
armenians
but
the
perpetrators
blame
russians
and
armenians
themselves
on
other
occasions
ar
each
time
the
parties
have
been
about
to
reach
an
agreement
in
ar
zheleznovodsk
moscow
tehran
rome
geneva
and
almaata
an
ar
invisible
hand
provoked
further
bloodshed
those
interested
in
ar
maintaining
the
azeriarmenian
conflict
as
well
as
the
georgian
ar
turmoil
are
imperialist
forces
in
russia
and
probably
in
iran
incorrect
when
were
the
people
of
nagornokarabakh
ever
involved
in
an
agreement
never
until
azerbaijan
sits
down
with
the
armenians
of
nagorno
karabakh
there
will
never
be
an
end
to
this
conflict
ar
the
armenian
offensive
last
spring
created
more
than
new
azeri
ar
refugees
from
the
captured
towns
of
upper
and
lower
karabakh
and
ar
adjacent
rural
districts
today
azeri
refugees
throng
the
ar
city
of
baku
and
environs
providing
more
problems
for
the
newly
ar
elected
popular
front
government
which
is
opposed
by
the
rigidly
ar
nationalistic
national
independence
party
its
called
war
if
the
azerbaijanis
didnt
try
to
deport
and
allow
the
armenians
of
nagornokarabakh
to
live
in
their
ways
keep
their
armenian
culture
these
armenians
would
not
have
had
to
defend
their
existence
the
azeris
should
not
have
assumed
that
armenians
were
going
to
roll
over
and
play
dead
ar
how
can
a
westernstyle
democracy
survive
in
a
small
muslim
country
ar
where
million
of
the
million
inhabitants
are
unemployed
in
the
ar
absence
of
any
international
effort
to
help
azeri
refugees
as
kurdish
ar
and
bosnian
refugees
have
been
helped
how
can
the
azeri
government
ar
reject
the
demand
of
these
exiles
to
recapture
their
lands
homes
and
ar
possessions
the
azeri
government
should
have
thought
about
such
thnings
before
they
attempted
to
deprive
armenians
of
lands
homes
and
possessions
ar
such
simple
realities
must
be
understood
in
the
west
ar
misunderstanding
caucasian
politics
leads
both
western
and
russian
ar
public
opinion
to
imagine
a
permanent
and
therefore
irreversible
ar
ethnic
and
religious
rivalry
in
the
caucasus
true
and
you
dr
alec
rasizade
should
practice
what
you
preach
ar
i
think
western
reluctance
to
interfere
derives
from
this
idea
ar
meanwhile
continuation
of
the
war
could
draw
both
eastern
and
western
ar
states
into
the
conflict
through
activation
of
various
security
ar
alliances
these
include
on
the
armenian
side
the
moscowled
ar
commonwealth
forces
under
the
tashkent
mutual
security
pact
signed
ar
may
on
the
azeri
side
should
turkey
get
involved
as
the
ar
guarantor
of
the
nakhichevan
autonomy
through
the
kars
treaty
of
oct
ar
these
include
the
north
atlantic
treaty
forces
western
interference
turkish
intervention
the
moment
turkey
dares
step
into
this
conflict
it
will
close
the
doors
of
any
chance
of
turkey
being
part
of
europe
as
if
it
ever
will
and
will
destroy
the
eastern
third
of
anatolia
dr
rasizade
international
realpolitik
is
not
as
simpleminded
as
you
would
have
us
believe
ar
upper
karabakh
generally
is
described
in
western
press
reports
as
an
ararmenian
enclave
within
azerbaijan
the
truth
is
that
the
armenians
ar
began
to
appear
there
only
in
the
middle
of
the
last
century
incorrect
once
again
a
brief
scan
of
history
addresses
such
a
foolish
claim
armenians
today
refer
to
the
area
of
nagornokarabakh
as
artsakh
which
comes
from
the
urartian

a

years
ago
they
celebrated
the
anniversary
of
their
ar
resettlement
from
persia
to
karabakh
after
it
came
under
russian
ar
rule
no
incorrect
the
celebration
was
the
anniversary
of
russian
rule
in
the
caucasus
including
karabakh
ar
at
the
same
time
the
russian
colonial
administration
also
drew
ar
in
russian
and
german
settlers
who
were
welcomed
by
azeris
how
ar
would
americans
react
if
the
large
numbers
of
armenians
living
in
ar
southern
california
suddenly
claimed
an
armenian
homeland
and
ar
demanded
separation
from
california
nonsequitur
ar
armenian
historians
insist
that
before
the
armenian
resettlement
ar
karabakh
was
inhabited
by
aboriginal
christians
that
is
correct
armenian
historians
dont
say
this
ar
the
people
of
medieval
caucasian
albania
adopted
christianity
in
the
ar
fourth
century
but
those
ancient
residents
had
no
link
to
and
ar
nothing
in
common
with
armenians
considering
the
caucasian
albans
were
of
the
armenian
apostolic
faith
and
their
utilization
of
the
armenian
language
in
their
liturgy
makes
such
an
argument
totally
invalid
ar
azeris
would
have
a
better
claim
to
ar
be
successors
of
albania
since
azeris
have
for
centuries
inhabited
ar
dominated
and
developed
the
karabakh
part
of
the
azeri
nation
wishing
to
be
part
of
a
people
nonexistent
for
nearly
a
millennium
for
geo
political
advantage
is
rather
outrageous
in
addition
to
such
absurdity
azeris
claim
to
be
turks
persians
and
all
the
while
are
azerizing
their
minorities
such
as
the
lezgians
kurds
tat
talish
and
a
host
of
other
nationalities
which
may
amount
to
nearly
half
the
population
of
azerbaijan
ar
both
armenia
and
azerbaijan
last
year
signed
the
final
act
of
the
ar
conference
on
security
and
cooperation
in
europe
of
and
the
ar
paris
charter
for
new
europe
of
confirming
their
mutual
ar
adherence
to
the
principle
of
inviolability
of
existing
borders
this
ar
principle
means
that
the
borders
and
territorial
integrity
of
the
ar
republic
of
azerbaijan
are
to
be
guaranteed
by
all
of
the
signatory
ar
nations
not
just
by
turkey
such
agreements
do
not
give
azerbaijan
the
right
to
depopulate
karabakh
of
armenians
ar
this
is
one
key
to
intervention
on
behalf
either
of
the
un
the
ar
csce
the
commonwealth
nato
or
iran
the
second
key
to
untying
the
ar
caucasian
knot
is
to
determine
who
is
the
aggressor
according
to
the
ar
un
definition
of
fine
so
why
has
azerbaijan
refused
to
allow
un
troops
into
the
armenian
enclave
what
is
azerbaijan
afraid
of
perhaps
the
fact
that
the
territory
is
the
home
of
armenians
the
un
would
by
definition
support
the
local
population
ar
when
that
is
accomplished
the
international
community
can
and
should
ar
apply
to
the
aggressor
in
the
caucasus
international
sanctions
such
as
ar
those
presently
being
employed
against
serbia
and
montenegro
in
the
ar
former
yugoslavia
such
decisive
collective
international
action
can
ar
halt
further
aggression
in
karabakh
and
prevent
the
armenianazeri
ar
conflict
from
growing
and
spreading
azerbaijans
refusal
to
allow
the
armenians
of
karabakh
to
determine
their
own
future
the
is
issue
not
viewing
isolating
events
out
of
context
are
actions
that
will
address
the
karabakh
conflict
viewing
events
in
a
war
in
isolation
and
out
of
context
is
like
viewing
the
landing
at
normandy
as
an
act
of
