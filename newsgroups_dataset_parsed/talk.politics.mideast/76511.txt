RE
WASGO
HEZBOLLAH
BRAD
HERNLEM
WRITES
WELL
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
NOTED
THAT
I
WAS
CHEERING
AN
ATTACK
ON
AN
ISRAELI
PATROL
INSIDE
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
WHILE
I
WAS
CONDEMNING
THE
RETALIATORY
SHELLING
OF
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
BY
ISRAELI
AND
ISRAELIBACKED
FORCES
MY
TEAM
YOU
SEE
WAS
PLAYING
FAIR
WHILE
THE
OPPOSING
TEAM
WAS
REARRANGING
THE
FACES
OF
THE
SPECTATORS
IN
MY
TEAMS
VIEWING
STANDS
SO
TO
SPEAK
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
TRY
TO
FIND
MORE
SOURCES
OF
NEWS
ABOUT
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
LEBANON
AND
TRY
TO
SEE
THROUGH
THE
PROPAGANDA
THERE
ARE
NO
A
PRIORI
BLACK
AND
WHITE
HATS
BUT
ONE
SURE
WONDERS
HOW
THE
IDF
CAN
BOMBARD
VILLAGES
IN
RETALIATION
TO
PINPOINT
ATTACKS
ON
ITS
SOLDIERS
IN
LEBANON
AND
THEN
CALL
THE
LEBANESE
TERRORISTS
IF
THE
ATTACK
WAS
JUSTIFIED
OR
NOT
IS
AT
LEAST
DEBATABLE
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
ISSUE
THE
ISSUE
IS
THAT
YOU
WERE
CHEERING
DEATH
READ
AGAIN
YOUR
ORIGINAL
ARTICLE
YOU
FIND
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THOSE
DEAD
SOLDIERS
THATS
A
REASONABLE
DEBATABLE
POINT
BUT
FEEL
SATISFACTION
FROM
DEAD
BODIES
IS
NOT
REASONABLE
BY
ANY
STANDARDS
NO
MATTER
HOW
YOU
TRY
TO
JUSTIFY
IT
I
MAY
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
FRUSTRATION
AGAINST
ISRAELI
OCCUPATION
IN
S
LEBANON
BUT
NO
MATTER
WHAT
YOU
SAY
I
CAN
NOT
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
SATISFACTION
FOR
DEAD
BODIES
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
FOR
YOU
LETS
ASSUME
A
BOSNIAN
VILLAGE
INHABITED
BY
SERBS
UNTILL
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
AND
LATER
TAKEN
OVER
BY
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
THE
MEANS
ARE
NOT
VERY
PEACEFUL
NOW
DO
YOU
ENJOY
SERBS
COMING
AND
KILLING
ALL
ARMED
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
I
WOULD
NOT
ENJOY
BUT
I
WOULD
NOT
ENJOY
ANY
DEAD
BODIES
ISRAELIS
LEBANESE
OR
BOSNIANS
