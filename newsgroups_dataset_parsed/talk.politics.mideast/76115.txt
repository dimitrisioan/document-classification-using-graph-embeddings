RESPONDS
THERE
WERE
A
COUPLE
MILLIONS
OF
GREEKS
LIVING
IN
ASIA
MINOR
UNTIL
SOMEONE
HAD
TO
PROTECT
THEM
IF
NOT
US
WHO
IS
THAT
SO
OR
YOU
WERE
TAKING
ADVANTAGE
OF
WEAKNESS
OF
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
TO
GRAB
SOME
LAND
AS
SOON
AS
YOU
GOT
GREEN
LIGHTS
FROM
ALLIED
FORCES
YOU
OCCUPIED
IZMIR
AND
OTHER
CITIES
IN
WESTERN
TURKEY
YOU
KILLED
AND
RAPED
MILLIONS
PEOPLE
WITHOUT
ANY
REASON
OF
COURSE
YOU
PAID
THE
PRICE
MUSTAFA
KEMAL
ATATURK
MADE
YOU
SWIM
IN
AEGEAN
SEA
BUT
NOT
FAR
ENOUGH
YOUR
AGGRESSIONS
THRU
TURKEY
AT
ANYTIME
IN
THE
PAST
DID
NOT
GET
YOU
ANY
REWARD
AND
SHALL
NOT
GET
YOU
ANYWHERE
DONT
SWALLOW
PROPAGANDA
AS
TRUTH
SIR
BRITISH
PROMISED
TO
VENIZELOS
GREEK
PM
THAT
MAINLY
GREEK
POPULATED
AREAS
OF
THE
OTTOMANS
WILL
BE
GIVEN
TO
GREECE
IF
HE
WILL
AGREE
TO
DRAG
GREECE
IN
THE
SIDE
OF
THE
BRITISH
DURING
THE
WWI
BECAUSE
THE
GREEK
KING
WAS
PROGERMAN
THE
BRITISH
SUCCEEDED
BY
BOMBARDING
ATHENS
KILLING
QUITE
A
FEW
FORCING
ABDICATION
OF
THE
KING
DIVISION
OF
GREECE
INTO
TWO
SEPARATE
STATES
NORTHSOUTH
AND
FINALLY
LAYING
THE
GROUND
FOR
THE
MOST
DISASTEROUS
DIVISION
BETWEEN
GREEKS
FOR
OUR
CENTURYSO
DONT
FEEL
BITTER
THAT
THE
ALLIES
GAVE
ANY
GREEN
LIGHT
BECAUSE
THEY
LIKED
US
ANYWAY
THE
BRITISH
SUCCEED
TO
ESTABLISH
VENIZELOS
WAR
STARTS
AT
A
SECOND
FRONT
AGAINST
THE
GERMANS
IN
THE
SOUTH
WHILE
THEY
WERE
FIGHTING
THE
WAR
IN
THE
EAST
AGAINST
THE
RUSSIANS
AND
FINALLY
THE
WWII
CAME
IN
AN
END
AFTER
THAT
THE
BRITISH
AND
FRENCH
FORGOT
IMMEDIATELY
THEIR
PROMISES
AS
USUALLY
EVEN
THOUGH
PUBLICLY
THEY
SAY
THAT
THEY
SUPPORT
THE
GREEK
CAUSE
PRACTICALLY
THEY
NOT
ONLY
DO
NOTHING
BUT
INSTEAD
USING
SOME
USUAL
REASONING
AND
OTHER
CRAP
RHETORIC
AS
A
PRETEXT
THEY
GRADUALLY
BACKUP
KEMAL
WHO
HAD
GIVEN
NOW
TO
THE
BRITISH
WATER
AND
BREAD
THAT
HE
WILL
DISSOLVE
THE
SUPERETHNIC
OTTOMAN
AND
CONTRACT
IT
INTO
A
SMALL
ETHNICSTATE
THE
MAIN
DRIVE
BEHIND
THIS
BRITISH
SWITCH
WAS
THE
PLAN
TO
KEEP
A
MUSLIM
STATE
IN
THE
REGION
AS
BUFFER
AGAINST
A
RUSSIAN
EXPANSION
INTO
WARMWATER
FACILITIES
THE
GREEK
EMPIRE
BEING
AN
ORTHODOX
CHRISTIAN
STATE
WAS
TOO
PRONE
TO
BECOME
RUSSIAN
CLIENT
OUT
OF
THIS
INTRIGUE
THE
CURRENT
STATE
OF
AFFAIRS
WAS
ESTABLISHED
ON
OUR
LANDS
WHILE
VENIZELOS
AND
KEMAL
WERE
PROMOTED
AS
TRUE
GIANTS
BY
THE
BRITISH
SINCE
THEY
WORKED
TO
REALIZE
THEIR
GOALS
IN
THE
REGION
UNDER
THE
SAME
PLAN
CURRENTLY
GREECE
AND
TURKEY
ARE
RECIPIENTS
OF
BIG
MILITARY
FUNDS
FROM
THE
US
BOTH
THEY
ARE
FUNCTIONING
AS
ANTIRUSSIAN
BUFFERS
WHILE
SIMULTANEOUSLY
BOTH
REMAIN
GOOD
CLIENTS
OF
STATE
DEPT
BECAUSE
OTHERWISE
THE
USE
OF
TERROR
OF
CHANGING
THE
BALANCE
OF
POWER
IN
THE
AEGEAN
WILL
BE
USED
UNDER
THE
SAME
EXACT
RATIONAL
YOU
SHOULD
SEE
THE
CYPRUS
PROBLEM
GR
PS
I
DONT
MAKE
ANY
ANTIWHATEVER
RHETORIC
THIS
IS
THE
SITUATION
IN
OUR
REGION
AND
NEEDS
TO
BE
SAID
THE
PREVIOUSLY
MENTIONED
POWERS
ARE
NOT
ANYTHING
SPECIAL
THEY
ARE
FUCNTIONING
THE
SAME
WAY
WHICH
ANYONE
ELSE
FUNCTIONS
ALL
THROUGHOUT
HISTORY
SO
I
DONT
SELECTIVELY
SINGLE
THEM
OUT
JUST
THEY
ARE
RELEVANT
TO
OUR
CURRENT
AFAIRS
