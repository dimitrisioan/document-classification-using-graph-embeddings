LIES
HAVE
THE
EYEWITNESSES
BEEN
DAYDREAMING
WERE
THESE
STORIES
FORGED
BY
TURKISH
JOURNALISTS
IN
THE
REGION
THE
NONSENSE
OF
SUCH
A
CLAIM
IS
CLEAR
FROM
THE
WRITINGS
OF
BRITISH
JOURNALISTS
TOO
TWO
DAYS
BEFORE
WE
HAD
QUOTED
FROM
A
SUNDAY
TIMES
ARTICLE
THEYBRITISH
REPORTED
THE

IN

EVEN
BEFORE

WHOSE

WERE
GOUGED

EVEN
THE
ARMENIAN
RADIO
COULDNT
CLAIM
THESE
LIES
THEY
ARE
SAYING
EXAGGERATION
THAT
MEANS
SOMETHINGS
HAVE
HAPPENED
BUT
THE
SITUATION
IS
NOT
AS
BAD
AS
REPORTED
PERHAPS
THAT
VILLAGE
OF
KHOJALU

WAS
DESTROYED

INSTEAD

GULSUM

THE

THE

OF
THIS
MASSACRE
ON

ENVIRONS
CANNOT
BE
REDUCED
BY
ANY
WORD
SOME
OF
THE
WESTERN

LED
BY
SOME
FRENCH
NEWSPAPERS
ABILITY
TO
CLOSE
THEIR

IS
NOTHING
BUT
COMPLICITY
IN
THIS
MASSACRE
YESTERDAY
WE
GAVE

FROM
LE
FIGARO
UNTIL
YESTERDAYS
PRINT
NO
NEWS
ABOUT
THE
REAL
EVENTS
IN
KARABAG
WERE
PRINTED
SO
WERE
THE
FRENCH
TV
CHANNELS
THE
SUBJECT
THEY
CONSIDERED
RELATED
TO
KARABAG
WAS
THE
NECESSITY
OF
PROTECTING
ARMENIANS
AGAINST
AZERI
ATTACKS
THE
AGE
WE
ARE
LIVING
IN
IS
TERMED
A
HUMAN
RIGHTS
AGE
THERE
ARE
LOTS
OF
ORGANIZATIONS
SUCH
AS
UNITED

AND
CSCECONFERENCE
ON
SECURITY
AND
COOPERATION
IN
EUROPE
AND
RULES
ALL
DESIGNED
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
HUMAN

VIOLATIONS
INTERNATIONAL
REACTIONS
MUST
BE
MADE
WITH
INTERNATIONAL
COOPERATION
WITH
SUPPORT
OF
EVERYBODY
AND
EVERY
ORGANIZATION
CLAIMING
TO
BE
CIVILIZED
COULD
THERE
BE
A
MORE
SERIOUS
HUMAN
RIGHTS
VIOLATION
THAN
THAT
OF
THE
RIGHT
TO
LIVE
AND
WITH
SUCH
LEVELS
OF
BARBARITY
AND
CRUELTY
WHERE
IS
THE
COOPERATION
WHERE
ARE
THE
REACTIONS
AND
THE
INTELLECTUALS
JOURNALISTS
WRITERS
TV
STATIONS
OF
CERTAIN
WESTERN
COUNTRIES
SUCH
AS
FRANCE
WHO
ARE
FAST
TO
CLAIM
LEADERSHIP

WHERE
ARE
YOU

ARGIC
WE
CLOSED
THE
ROADS
AND
MOUNTAIN
PASSES
THAT
MIGHT
SERVE
AS
WAYS
OF

FOR
THE
