you
well

you
should
indeed
be

you
rekindled

distortions
propagated

if
you
feel

you
can
simply
act

an
armenian
governmental
crony
in
this
forum
you
will
be
sadly
mistaken

duly
embarrassed
this

not
a

who
plan
to
prove
that
the
armenian
genocide
of
million
turks
and
kurds
is
nothing
less
than
a
classic
unredressed
genocide
we
are
neither
in
xsoviet

in
some
similar
ultranationalist

dictatorship
that
employs
the
dictates

xsoviet
armenian
government
got
away
with
the
genocide
of
million
turkish
men
women
and
children
and
is
enjoying
the
fruits
of
that
genocide
you
and
those
like
you
will
not
get
away
with
the
genocides
coverup
during
the
first
world
war
and
the
ensuing
years
the
armenians
through
a
premeditated
and
systematic
genocide
tried
to
complete
its
centuriesold
policy
of
annihilation
against
the
turks
and
kurds
by
savagely
murdering
million
muslims
and
deporting
the
rest
from
their
year
homeland
the
attempt
at
genocide
is
justly
regarded
as
the
first
instance
of
genocide
in
the
century
acted
upon
an
entire
people
this
event
is
incontrovertibly
proven
