re
clintons
views
on
jerusalem
it
seems
that
president
clinton
can
recognize
jerusalem
as
israels
capitol
while
still
keeping
his
diplomatic
rear
door
open
by
stating
that
the
parties
concerned
should
decide
the
citys
final
status
even
as
i
endorse
clintons
vie
w
of
course
it
is
definitely
a
matter
to
be
decided
upon
by
israel
and
other
participating
neighboring
contries
i
see
no
real
conflict
in
stating
both
views
nor
expect
any
better
from
politicians
