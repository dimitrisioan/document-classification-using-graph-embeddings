RE
FINAL
SOLUTION
FOR
GAZA
DEAR
FOLKS
I
AM
STILL
AWAITING
FOR
SOME
SENSIBLE
ANSWER
AND
COMMENT
IT
IS
A
FACT
THAT
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
GAZA
ARE
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
A
NORMAL
CIVLIZED
LIFE
THEY
HABE
BEEN
KEPT
UNDER
OCCUPATION
BY
ISRAEL
SINCE
WITHOUT
CIVIL
AND
POLITICAL
RIGHTS
IT
IS
A
FACT
THAT
GAZANS
LIVE
IN
THEIR
OWN
COUNTRY
PALESTINE
GAZA
IS
NOT
A
FORIEGN
COUNTRY
NOR
IS
TELAVIV
JAFFA
ASKALON
BEERSHEBA
FOREIGN
COUNTRY
FOR
GAZANS
ALL
THESE
PLACES
ARE
OCCUPIED
AS
FAR
AS
PALESTINIANS
ARE
CONCERNED
AND
AS
FAR
AS
COMMON
SENSE
HAS
IT
IT
IS
A
FACT
THAT
ZIONISTS
DENY
GAZANS
EQUAL
RIGHTS
AS
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
AND
THE
RIGHT
TO
DETERMINE
BY
THEMSEVLES
THEIR
GOVERNMENT
WHEN
ZIONISTS
WILL
BEGIN
TO
CONSIDER
GAZANS
AS
HUMAN
BEINGS
WHO
DESERVE
THE
SAME
RIGHTS
AS
THEMSELVES
THERE
WILL
BE
HOPE
FOR
PEACE
NOT
BEFORE
SOMEBODY
MENTIONED
THAT
GAZA
IS
FOREIGN
COUNTRY
AND
THEREFORE
ISRAEL
IS
ENTITLED
TO
CLOSE
ITS
BORDERS
TO
GAZA
IN
THIS
CASE
GAZA
SHOULD
BE
ENTITLED
TO
RECIPROCATE
AND
DENY
ISRAELI
CIVILIANS
AND
MILITARY
PERSONNEL
TO
ENTER
THE
AREA
AS
THE
RELATION
IS
NOT
SYMMETRICAL
BUT
THAT
OF
A
MASTER
AND
SLAVE
THE
LABEL
FOREIGN
COUNTRY
IS
INACCURATE
AND
MISLEADING
TO
CLOSE
OFF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
STRIP
DENY
THEM
MEANS
OF
SUBSISTENCE
AND
MEANS
OF
DEFENDING
THEMSELVES
IS
A
COLLECTIVE
PUNISHMENT
AND
A
CRIME
IT
IS
NEITHER
JUSTIFIABLE
NOR
LEGAL
IT
JUST
REFLECTS
THE
ABYSS
TO
WHICH
ISRAELI
SOCIETY
HAS
DEGRADED
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
ASK
ANY
OF
THOSE
WHO
HEAP
FOUL
LANGAUGE
ON
ME
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
ISRAEL
DENIES
GAZANS
WHO
WERE
BORN
AND
BROUGHT
UP
IN
JAFFA
TO
RETURN
AND
LIVE
THERE
WOULD
THEY
BE
ALLOWED
TO
IF
THEY
CONVERTED
TO
JUDAISM
IS
THEIR
RIGHT
TO
LIVE
IN
THEIR
FORMER
TOWN
DEPDENDENT
UPON
THEIR
RELIGION
OR
ETHNIC
ORIGIN
PLEASE
GIVE
AN
HONEST
ANSWER
ELIAS
