I
CONSIDER
THAT
DEFINING
THE
BELONGING
TO
A
NATION
THAT
CLAIMS
THE
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
A
STATE
BASED
ON
RELIGIOUS
BELIEF
IS
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
ALTHOUGH
I
DONT
WANT
TO
MUDDY
THE
WATERS
UNNECESSARILY
I
DISAGREE
ANY
DISCRIMINATION
BASED
ON
RELIGION
IS
NOT
AND
CANNOT
BE
RACIST
UNLESS
THE
SOLE
QUALIFICATION
FOR
RELIGIOUS
MEMBERSHIP
IS
RACIAL
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
FOR
ISRAEL
ALTHOUGH
IT
MIGHT
GET
A
LITTLE
CLOSER
THAN
SAY
ISLAM
THIS
OF
COURSE
RAISES
THE
VEXED
QUESTION
OF
CHURCH
ANTISEMITISM
JEWS
HAVE
BEEN
HEAVILY
DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST
ON
THE
GROUNDS
OF
RELIGION
IN
MANY
CHRISTIAN
COUNTRIES
IF
WE
TAKE
RUSSIA
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
JEWS
WERE
SERIOUSLY
PERSECUTED
BUT
THAT
PERSECUTION
IN
THE
EYES
OF
THE
CHURCH
AND
STATE
STOPPED
AT
THE
BAPTISMAL
FONT
OFFICIALLY
ANYWAY
IF
A
JEW
CONVERTED
THERE
WERE
NO
LEGAL
BARRIERS
IN
HIS
WAY
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
ANYWAY
PETER
THE
GREATS
INTERIOR
MINISTER
CAME
FROM
SUCH
A
CONVERT
BACKGROUND
CAN
WE
THEN
CLAIM
THAT
THE
RUSSIAN
ORTHODOX
DID
NOT
TEACH
ANTISEMITISM
AND
WAS
NOT
ANTISEMITIC
SIMILARLY
FOR
THE
ROMAN
CATHOLIC
CHURCH
I
SUSPECT
SO
AS
THIS
IS
NOT
A
RACIAL
TAINT
BUT
ONE
BASED
ON
BELIEF
AND
AS
IS
AFTER
ALL
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
WELL
MAYBE
NOT
WHAT
IS
ANTISEMITISM
THEN
IF
NOT
SOMETHING
RACIALLY
BASED
I
WONDER
IF
HITLER
KILLED
CONVERTS
OF
PURE
GERMAN
BLOOD
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
ONE
WAY

OTHER
