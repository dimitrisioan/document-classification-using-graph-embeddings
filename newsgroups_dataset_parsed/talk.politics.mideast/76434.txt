can
someone
elaborate
a
little
on
what
this
libertarian
movement
is
i
am
not
going
to
draw
conclusions
from
a
small
sample
but
so
far
i
recall
two
selfdescribed
libertarians
posting
here
both
seems
to
be
incredibly
ignorant
incredibly
arrogant
all
they
want
is
to
get
people
angry
posses
a
lousy
sense
of
humor
write
incoherently
and
jump
from
topic
to
topic
without
any
logical
connection
between
topics
describe
themselves
as
intelligent
and
knowledgeable
although
everything
in
their
posters
points
to
the
opposite
very
childish
the
libertarians
believe
in
getting
the
government
off
the
backs
of
the
people
so
that
the
free
market
can
solve
problems
libertarians
believe
in
an
end
to
the
welfare
state
an
end
to
government
subsidies
of
all
sorts
the
basic
idea
is
that
the
government
is
way
too
big
and
way
too
expensive
and
should
be
shrunk
down
to
a
reasonable
size
they
also
believe
in
a
complete
end
to
foreign
aid
including
the
stationing
of
american
troops
overseas
we
can
not
and
should
not
be
policing
the
world
i
agree
that
the
people
who
come
into
this
group
and
describe
themselves
as
libertarians
seem
to
posses
the
charictaristics
you
describe
but
heck
were
not
all
like
this
im
a
libertarian
and
ive
got
a
great
sense
of
humor

if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual
favors
we
sure
wouldnt
waste
them
on
