RE
ISRAEL
AN
APARTHEID
STATE
I
THINK
THERE
ARE
SOME
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
CRITERIA
ACCORDING
TO
WHICH
ONE
CAN
EVALUATE
WHETHER
CERTAIN
POLICIES
OR
PRACTICES
CONSTITUTE
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
THESE
CRITERIA
ARE
TO
BE
FOUND
FOR
EXAMPLE
IN
THE
INTERNATIONAL
CONVENTION
FOR
ABOLITION
OF
ALL
FORMS
OF
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
RATIFIED
BY
MOST
COUNTRIES
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COVENANT
OF
POLITICAL
AND
CIVIL
RIGHTS
THE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
CHARTER
THE
EUROPEAN
CONVENTION
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IF
ONE
READS
CAREFULLY
HOW
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
IS
DEFINED
IN
THESE
LEGALLY
BINDING
INSTRUMENTS
AND
DOES
NOT
RESORT
TO
SOPHISTRY
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
IS
GUILTY
OF
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
THE
PEOPLE
SUFFERING
THE
MOST
EXTREME
FORM
OF
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATNION
BY
THE
ZIONIST
REGIME
ARE
THE
PALESTINIAN
REFUGEES
SOME
OF
WHOM
LIVE
UNDER
ISRAELI
MILITARY
CONTROL
AND
OTHERS
WHO
LIVE
IN
THE
DIASPORA
THEY
ARE
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
RETURN
TO
THEIR
HOMELAND
FOR
THE
SOLE
REASON
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
JEWS
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
DOES
NOT
INCLUDE
ANY
PROVISIONS
WHICH
PERMITS
SUCH
DENIAL
OF
RIGHTS
UNDER
ANY
CIRCUMSTANCE
ISRAELS
ACTIONS
OF
DENIAL
ARE
TOTALLY
ILLEGAL
AND
IMMORAL
BY
ALLOWING
THE
RETURN
OF
THE
REFUGEES
AND
PERMITTING
THEM
TO
SETTLE
IN
TEL
IN
ANY
AREA
OF
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
THE
STATE
WOULD
FINALLY
GAIN
ITS
LEGITIMATY
UNDER
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
AND
COULD
BE
JUSTIFIED
IN
ASKING
TO
BE
RECOGNIZED
IT
WOULD
FACILITATE
THE
PEACEFUL
INTEGRATION
OF
ISRAEL
INTO
THE
MIDDLEEAST
AND
CONSTITUTE
THE
BEST
GUARANTEE
FOR
PERMANENT
JEWISH
PRESENCE
IN
THE
AREA
ANY
ATTEMPT
TO
CREATE
A
SEPARATION
FORMAL
AND
HUMAN
BETWEEN
THE
ISRAELI
JEWISH
AND
PALESTINIAN
ARAB
COMMUNITIES
IS
FRAUGHT
WITH
GENOCIADAL
IMPLICATIONS
I
HOPE
THAT
US
JEWS
WHO
SINCERELY
WISH
THAT
PEACE
PREVAIL
IN
ISRAELPALESTINE
WILL
FINALLY
REALIZE
THIS
FACT
