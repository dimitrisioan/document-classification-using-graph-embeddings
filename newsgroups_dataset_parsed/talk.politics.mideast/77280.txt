RE
EUROPE
VS
MUSLIM
BOSNIANS
LOOK
NOBODY
ASKED
THOSE
COUNTRIES
ABOUT
THEIR
UN
FORCES
TO
BE
ON
THE
GROUND
THEY
CAN
TAKE
THEIR
FORCES
WHICH
ARE
INCOMPONENT
AND
INEFFECTIVE
AT
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
LET
WHOEVER
ARE
WILLING
TO
DO
THE
JOB
WHAT
IT
TAKES
HOW
ANYONE
CAN
DEFEND
THIS
STINKING
UN
FORCE
ON
THE
GROUND
WHO
LET
THE
BOSNNIAN
PM
YANKED
OUT
FROM
THE
UN
VEHICLE
AND
BEING
SHOT
BY
THE
SERBIAN
MILITARY
HOW
ANYONE
CAN
DEFEND
THIS
UN
FORCE
WHO
ARE
JUST
WATCHING
THE
SHELLING
ON
CITIES
AND
TOWNS
EVERYDAY
HOW
ANYONE
CAN
DEFEND
AND
SAY
THOSE
STINKING
UN
FORCES
BEING
EFFECTIVE
WHEN
BOSNIAN
HAD
ALMOST
CHILDREN
CASUALTIES
BETWEEN
AGE
GROUPS
I
THINK
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
CURRENT
UN
FORCES
TO
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
IS
JUST
AN
INSULT
TO
THEIR
CASUALTIES
I
THINK
SENATOR
BIDEN
SAID
IT
ALL
WHAT
HAS
TO
BE
SAID
ON
THIS
ISSUE
EUROPE
IS
A
SAD
PLACE
TO
CRITICIZE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IN
ANYWHERE
IN
THIS
WORLD
LIKE
BIDEN
SAID
THEY
ARE
THE
BIGOTS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
CULTURAL
DIFFERENCE
AND
MINORTY
CLOSER
TO
THEIR
HOME
BECAUSE
THEY
GET
RID
OF
THEIR
MINORITIES
LONG
LONG
TIME
AGO
STARTING
IN
CENTURIES
AND
THEY
LET
ADOLPH
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
THE
REST
IN
CENTURY
BUT
HE
WAS
MUCH
MORE
NAUGHTY
THAN
THEY
EXPECTED
BECAUSE
HE
DARED
TO
STEP
MANY
TOES
SO
WHY
SPOIL
THE
GOOD
THING
NOW
WHEN
SERBS
DOING
TODAY
WHAT
THEY
WERE
THINKING
THE
SAME
YESTERDAY
C
AKGUN
INFACT
ON
TUESDAY
THE
BOSNIAN
FOREIGN
MINISTER
ASKED
FORMALLY
THE
UN
TO
LEAVE
BOSNIA
JUST
TO
SHOW
HOW
MUCH
HYPOCRACY
IS
THERE
IN
EUROPE
THESE
SO
CALLED
UN
IS
ACTUALLY
HELPING
SERBS
CARRY
OUT
THEIR
ETNICCLENSINGMURDERSRAPES
IN
ZEPA
THE
UN
EFFECTIVELY
HELPED
THE
SERBS
CARRY
OUT
THEIR
HEINOUS
CRIMES
BY
SPREADING
CONFLICTING
REPORTS
THAT
NOTHING
WAS
GOING
ON
THERE
THE
COWARDS
OR
SO
CALLED
UN
PEACEMAKERS
ONLY
ATTEMPTED
TO
GO
OUT
THERE
FOR
A
FACT
FINDING
MISSION
AS
IF
WITH
ALL
THE
HAMRADIO
OPERATORS
WERE
LYING
AND
ALL
THE
US
WAR
PLANES
OUT
THERE
HAVE
NO
MEANS
OF
FLYING
OVER
THERE
THIS
IS
THE
BIGGEST
FARCE
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
WORLD
AND
THE
SAME
ACT
HAS
BEEN
REPEATED
OVER
AND
OVER
AGAIN
IN
DIFFERENT
BESEIGED
BOSNIAN
TOWNS
YES
I
HEARD
TODAY
THAT
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
BOSNIA
UNDER
PRESSURE
FROM
THE
CIVILIZED
NATIONS
HAS
APPEALED
TO
THE
UN
TO
STAY
THERE
IN
BOSNIA
HE
SHOULD
KNOW
BETTER
THESE
HYPOCRATES
SADLY
IT
INCLUDES
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
TOO
ALL
CAME
OUT
AND
SAID
THAT
THE
CALL
FOR
A
REFERENDUM
FROM
BOSNIAN
SERBIAN
PERLIMENT
OR
A
BUNCH
OF
RAPISTSCRIMINALS
IS
A
FARCE
AND
YET
THEY
HAVE
TO
WAIT
FOR
THE
RESULT
OF
THIS
REFERENDUM
TO
ACT
FOR
THOSE
OF
YOU
WHO
ARE
AGAINST
US
TO
COMMIT
GROUND
TROOPS
FINE
JUST
LIFT
THE
ARMSEMBARGO
ON
BOTH
SIDES
SINCE
WE
KNOW
THAT
SERBS
ALWAYS
GOT
THE
HEAVY
WEAPONS
FORM
FEDERAL
ARMY
WAKE
UP
WEST
AND
ADMIT
THAT
YOU
ARE
THE
MOST
UNCIVILIZED
THE
MOST
HYPOCRATIC
AND
THE
MOST
VIOLENT
BUNCH
ON
THIS
EARTH
KHALID
DISCLAIMER
THESE
ARE
ONLY
MY
OPINIONS
AND
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
MY
EMPLOYERS
