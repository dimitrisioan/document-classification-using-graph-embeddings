RE
DEIR
YASSIN
GET
THEE
TO
A
NUNNERY
WRITES
FIRST
OF
ALL
HARRY
I
AM
NOT
SO
UNINFORMED
ABOUT
IRGUNS
TERRORIST
ACTIVITIES
ILL
GIVE
YOU
A
FEW
QUOTES
FROM
A
BOOK
BY
CHARLES
D
SMITH
IN
HIS
PALESTINE
AND
THE
ARAB
ISRAELI
CONFLICT
AH
PALESTINE
AND
THE
ARAB
ISRAELI
CONFLICT
SOUNDS
INTERESTING
BEGIN
DIRECTED
THE
IRGUN
TO
BOMB
ONLY
CIVILIAN
THATS
RIGHT
CIVILIAN
INSTALLATIONS
LINKED
TO
THE
MANDATORY
AUTHORITY
NOT
MILITARY
SITES
THIS
IS
MISLEADING
I
SUPPOSED
CHARLES
D
SMITH
CHARACTERIZES
THE
BOMBING
OF
THE
KING
DAVID
HOTEL
AS
A
CIVILIAN
INSTALLATION
TOO
ANY
INSTALLATION
ATTACKED
BY
ETZEL
WAS
LINKED
TO
SOME
SORT
OF
OFFICIAL
FUNCTION
OF
THE
MANDATORY
GOVERNMENT
AND
OF
COURSE
THERE
IS
THE
LEHI
SPLINTER
GROUP
WHICH
INCLUDED
SUCH
NOTABLE
ISRAELIS
AS
YITZAK
SHAMIR
THE
LEHI
FIGHTERS
FOR
THE
FREEDOM
OF
ISRAEL
RESUMED
ITS
ASSASSINATIONS
OF
BRITISH
OFFICIALS
CIVILIAN
AND
MILITARY
WHAT
KIND
OF
CIVILIANS
I
ASSUME
CHARLES
D
SMITH
MEANS
COMPLETELY
INNOCENT
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
INTENTIONALLY
TARGETED
RIGHT
PLEASE
PROVIDE
EXAMPLES
AND
THERE
IS
OF
COURSE
DAIR
YASSIN
WHERE
MEN
WOMAN
AND
CHILDREN
WERE
KILLED
PERHAPS
IM
SURE
FOR
STRATEGIC
REASONS
YET
WHAT
EVER
HAPPENED
TO
THE
NON
AGGRESSION
PACT
WITH
THE
HAGANA
I
HAVE
REFERENCES
FOR
THAT
IF
YOUD
LIKE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
LIKE
BLATANT
SCARE
TACTICS
THAT
BEGIN
HIMSELF
ADMITS
TO
HAVING
BEEN
VERY
USEFUL
IN
SCARING
OFF
THE
PALESTINIAN
ARABS
I
DO
HAVE
REFERENCES
THE
REVOLTLOS
ANGELES
NICE
STRAWMAN
IN
THE
REVOLT
BEGIN
DOES
STATE
THAT
THE
MYTH
OF
A
MASSACRE
AT
DEIR
YASSIN
MAY
HAVE
HAD
THE
EFFECT
OF
SCARING
SOME
ARABS
INTO
FLEEING
HOWEVER
NOWHERE
DOES
HE
CLAIM
THAT
THIS
WAS
THE
RESULT
OF
ANY
SPECIFIC
POLICY
OF
THE
ETZEL
THUS
IF
IT
DID
HAPPEN
IT
WAS
NOT
SO
INTENDED
I
THINK
ARAB
CALLS
FOR
PALESTINIANS
TO
LEAVE
AND
FEAR
OF
A
WAR
STARTED
BY
ARAB
HANDS
HAD
A
GREATER
EFFECTON
ARAB
MIGRATION
THAN
DEIR
YASSIN
IN
FACT
THESE
JEWISH
TERRORIST
GROUPS
MANAGED
ALL
IN
ALL
TO
SCARE
OFF
ARABS
BY
MAY
REALLY
NICE
USE
OF
CAPS
I
LIKE
IT
VERY
EFFECTIVE
ACTUALLY
ACCORDING
TO
MANY
SOURCES
INCLUDING
AMERICAN
DIPLOMATIC
OFFICIALS
THE
GREATEST
ENCOURAGMENT
FOR
ARABS
TO
LEAVE
THEIR
VILLAGES
CAME
FROM
ARAB
LEADERS
THIS
CERTAINLY
MIGHT
BE
ALL
A
MATTER
OF
SEMANTICS
HOWEVER
YOU
MIGHT
SAY
THAT
THE
HAGANA
DID
THIS
FOR
WAR
BUT
LIKE
I
SAID
BEFORE
HOW
DO
WE
NOT
KNOW
THAT
THE
PALESTINIAN
CONFLICT
ISNT
EQUATABLE
WITH
A
WAR
IF
ISRAEL
NEVER
GOT
HER
STATE
THE
HAGANAS
ACTIVITIES
WOULD
BE
LOST
IN
HISTORY
CATEGORIZED
AS
TEWRRORISM
FOR
SURE
BECAUSE
IT
COULD
NOT
BE
IDENTIFIED
WITH
THE
CAUSE
OF
A
STATE
I
DO
TAKE
THIS
SERIOUSLY
HARRY
I
SINCERELY
THINK
THE
PALESTINIANS
ARE
BEING
DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST
IN
THIS
CASE
BECAUSE
PERHAPS
EVERYONE
THINKS
THEIR
CAUSE
IS
BOGUS
ANYWAY
JUST
SOME
STUFF
TO
PONDER
OVER
OVER
AND
OUT
