links
washington
upi
a
senior
state
department
official
on
tuesday
ruled
out
any
softening
of
us
attitudes
toward
iraq
but
said
relations
with
irans
islamic
regime
could
improve
substantially
if
that
government
disassociates
itself
from
international
terrorism
despite
the
namecalling
and
the
harsh
rhetoric
from
across
the
gulf
despite
all
this
we
do
not
take
a
position
of
permanent
hostility
towards
the
islamic
republic
of
iran
david
mack
deputy
assistant
secretary
for
near
eastern
affairs
said
the
primary
us
objection
is
irans
international
behaviour
which
includes
extending
support
of
violence
to
disrupt
the
arab
israeli
peace
process
and
its
rapid
buildup
of
dangerous
weapons
mack
said
iran
could
contribute
to
regional
stability
and
peace
but
first
it
is
to
end
the
behaviour
which
threatens
this
area
mack
spoke
at
the
usgcc
business
conference
aimed
at
promoting
gulfamerican
trade
he
said
the
middle
east
will
be
an
item
very
high
on
the
agenda
of
the
us
administration
the
importance
of
the
gulf
is
underlined
by
secretary
of
state
warren
christopers
visit
last
year
to
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
before
anywhere
else
in
the
world
mack
said
he
added
that
the
us
has
no
longterm
plan
to
station
troops
in
the
gulf
mack
also
insisted
that
the
clinton
administration
will
continue
to
pressure
iraq
to
comply
with
all
the
un
security
resolutions
as
long
as
iraq
is
ruled
by
saddam
hussein
we
do
not
expect
compliance
mack
told
delegates
