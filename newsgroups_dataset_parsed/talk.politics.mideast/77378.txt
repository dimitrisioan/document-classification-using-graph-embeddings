WRITES
AND
IF
YOU
ARE
JEWISH
YOU
ARE
A
SELFHATING
JEW
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
DOUBT
OF
THIS
THERE
ARE
DOUBTS
ABOUT
IT
WHY
DONT
YOU
DEFINE
WHAT
SELFHATING
JEW
MEANS
I
FOUND
THE
IDEA
ITSELF
OF
BEING
A
SELFHATING
JEW
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THOSE
I
HOPE
YOU
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
A
DEFINITION
IN
ITSELF
TRY
COMING
UP
WITH
YOUR
OWN
DEFINITION
OF
ANY
OR
ALL
SELFHATING
PEOPLES
TO
ME
ANY
WHO
REJECT
THEIR
CULTURE
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
THEY
ONLY
SEE
THE
ABSOLUTE
NEGATIVES
OF
THAT
CULTURE
GENERALLY
OR
REGARDING
A
PARTICULAR
EVENT
AND
ACCEPT
ONLY
THOSE
VIEWS
PURELY
OPPOSING
ASPECTS
OF
THAT
CULTURE
THUS
SELECTIVE
BELIEF
IN
AND
USE
OF
HISTORICAL
FACTS
AND
A
COMPLETE
IGNORING
OF
CONTEXT
RESULTS
HATE
THEIR
CULTURE
THAT
CERTAINLY
DESCRIBES
ELIAS
SINCE
HE
HAS
NO
INTENTION
OF
RECOGNIZING
THAT
ALONGSIDE
THE
PALESTINIAN
EXPERIENCE
AND
PERSPECTIVE
THERE
EXISTS
ALSO
THAT
OF
ISRAELIS
WHO
IS
A
JEW
A
PERSON
WHOSE
INTEGRITY
DECAYS
WHEN
UNMOVED
BY
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
WRONG
DONE
TO
OTHER
PEOPLE
A
J
HESCHEL
THAT
IS
WHY
I
GET
MOVED
WHEN
I
SEE
THE
ISRAELI
ARMY
KILLING
PEOPLE
IN
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
AS
MUCH
AS
I
GET
MOVED
WHEN
I
SEE
A
PLESTINIAN
STABING
PEOPLE
IN
ISRAEL
AAP
AND
THIS
IS
PRECISELY
WHY
ISRAELI
SOCIETY
HAS
BEEN
TREMENDOUSLY
HARMED
BY
THE
ACTIONS
IT
ITS
GOVERNMENT
HAS
FELT
IT
HAD
TO
TAKE
IN

TO
AN
OTHER
PERCEIVED
AS
A
THREAT
JUST
AS
WITH
YOU
THERE
HAS
LONG
BEEN
A
STRIDENT
AND
EMOTIONAL
DEBATE
ABOUT
THE
PAIN
ISRAELIS
FEEL
WHEN
FORCED
TO
BALANCE
DESIRES
FOR
SURVIVAL
AND
MORAL
BELIEFS
THE
TRAUMA
OF
HAVING
TO
MAKE
THAT
CHOICE
IS
MADE
WORSE
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
NEITHER
CAN
BE
CONVENIENTLY
BRUSHED
