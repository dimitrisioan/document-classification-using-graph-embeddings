I
SURE
HOPE
SO
BECAUSE
THE

ARMENIAN

BURNED

IT
IS
NOT

OF

WELL
THERE
IS
A
BIT
SUCH
AS
THE
GERMAN
REPARATIONS
TO
THE
JEWISH
SURVIVORS
OF
THE
HOLOCAUST
CERTAINLY
AS
SUCH
AN
EVENT
GOES
FURTHER
INTO
THE
PAST
REPARATIONS
BECOME
LESS
REALISTIC
I
WAS
CONVINCED
THAT
NO
ONE
COULD
HAVE
A
MORE
WARPED
SENSE
OF
THE
WORLD
THEY
WERE
OUR
GRANDPARENTS
WHO
WERE
COLDBLOODEDLY
EXTERMINATED
BY
THE
ARMENIANS
BETWEEN
AND
NOT
YOURS
AND
YOU
CAN
ALWAYS
PARTICIPATE
IN
THE
TURKISH
GENOCIDE
DAY
ALONG
WITH
MILLIONS
OF
TURKISH
AND
KURDISH
PEOPLE
ON
APRIL
IN
THE
UNITED

AND
CANADA
ON
THIS
OCCASION
WE
ONCE
AGAIN
REITERATE
THE
UNQUESTIONED
JUSTICE
OF
THE
RESTITUTION
OF
TURKISH
AND
KURDISH
RIGHTS
AND
WE
DEMAND
THAT
THE
XSOVIET
ARMENIAN
GOVERNMENT
ADMIT
ITS
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THE
TURKISH
AND
KURDISH
GENOCIDE
RENDER
REPARATIONS
TO
THE
MUSLIM
PEOPLE
AND
RETURN
THE
LAND
TO
ITS
RIGHTFUL
OWNERS
THE
RECOGNITION
OF
THE
GENOCIDE
HAS
BECOME
AN
ISSUE
WHICH
CANNOT
BE
DELAYED
FURTHER
AND
IT
IS
IMPERATIVE
THAT
ARTIFICIAL
OBSTACLES
CREATED
FOR
POLITICAL
MANIPULATIONS
BE
REMOVED
WE
BELIEVE
THE
TIME
HAS
COME
TO
DEMAND
FROM
THE
THE
UNITED

THAT
IT
FORMALLY
RECOGNIZES
THE
TURKISH
AND
KURDISH
GENOCIDE
ADOPTS
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF

DEMANDS
AND
REFUSES
TO
ACCEDE

PROTEST
TO
THE

GOVERNMENT
POLICY
OF
