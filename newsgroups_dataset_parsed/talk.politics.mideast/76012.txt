i
sure
hope
so
because
the
unspeakable
crimes
of
the
armenians
must
be
righted
armenian
invaders
burned
and
sacked
the
fatherland
of
no
no
no
no
no
no
no
it
is
not
justifiable
to
right
wrongs
of
previous
years
well
there
is
a
bit
such
as
the
german
reparations
to
the
jewish
survivors
of
the
holocaust
certainly
as
such
an
event
goes
further
into
the
past
reparations
become
less
realistic
i
was
convinced
that
no
one
could
have
a
more
warped
sense
of
the
world
they
were
our
grandparents
who
were
coldbloodedly
exterminated
by
the
armenians
between
and
not
yours
and
you
can
always
participate
in
the
turkish
genocide
day
along
with
millions
of
turkish
and
kurdish
people
on
april
in
the
united
states
and
canada
on
this
occasion
we
once
again
reiterate
the
unquestioned
justice
of
the
restitution
of
turkish
and
kurdish
rights
and
we
demand
that
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
admit
its
responsibility
for
the
turkish
and
kurdish
genocide
render
reparations
to
the
muslim
people
and
return
the
land
to
its
rightful
owners
the
recognition
of
the
genocide
has
become
an
issue
which
cannot
be
delayed
further
and
it
is
imperative
that
artificial
obstacles
created
for
political
manipulations
be
removed
we
believe
the
time
has
come
to
demand
from
the
the
united
states
that
it
formally
recognizes
the
turkish
and
kurdish
genocide
adopts
the
principles
of
our
demands
and
refuses
to
accede
to
armenian
pressures
to
the
contrary
as
taxpayers
of
the
united
states
we
express
our
vehement
protest
to
the
present
us
government
policy
of
continued
coddling
protection
and
unqualified
assistance
towards
xsoviet
armenia
we
also
demand
that
the
united
states
return
to
the
policies
advocated
by
us
ambassador
bristol
and
other
enlightened
statesmen
who
have
undertaken
a
just
human
and
benevolent
attitude
towards
the
rights
of
the
muslim
people
and
the
just
resolution
of
their
case
our
territorial
demands
are
strictly
aimed
at
xsoviet
armenias
and
in

you
have
blatantly
lied
