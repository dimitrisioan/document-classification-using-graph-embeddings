TEN
QUESTIONS
TO
ISRAELIS
DEAR
SHAI
IN
THE
ANSWER
TO
MY
FIRST
QUESTION
CONCERNING
THE
NONEXISTENCE
OF
ISRAELI
NATIONALITY
YOUR
ANSWER
CONFLICTS
WITH
INFORMATION
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
FROM
OTHER
QUARTERS
ACCORDING
TO
WHICH
THERE
ARE
TWO
DISTINCT
CATEGORIES
OF
CLASSIFYING
ISRAELIS
CITIZENSHIP
EZRAHUT
AND
NATIONALITY
LEUM
THE
FORMER
IS
USED
ON
PASSPORTS
ETC
AND
THE
LATER
FOR
DAILY
IDENTIFICATION
IN
ISRAELI
SOCIETY
I
AM
TOLD
THAT
PEOPLE
IN
ISRAEL
HAVE
TO
CARRY
THEIR
ID
CARDS
AT
ALL
TIMES
AND
PRESENT
THEM
AT
MANY
PUBLIC
PLACES
ALMOST
EVERY
DAY
THESE
ID
CARDS
MAKE
CLEAR
WHO
THE
HOLDER
IS
A
JEW
OR
AN
ARAB
YOU
MAINTAIN
THAT
THIS
MAINLY
BECAUSE
OF
RELIGIOUS
SERVICES
PROVIDED
BUT
DO
YOU
REALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
COULD
YOU
PROVIDE
EVIDENCE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
AND
THAT
IT
SERVES
NO
OTHER
PURPOSE
A
NUMBER
OF
POINTS
YOU
ARE
MAKING
ASSUMPTIONS
ABOUT
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
THE
CARDS
ARE
USED
TRUE
BY
LAW
ALL
RESIDENTS
CITIZENS
AND
TOURISTS
MUST
CARRY
A
FORM
OF
IDENTIFICATION
WITH
THEM
FOR
CITIZENS
THE
STANDARD
ID
IS
THE
ID
CARD
THE
PURPOSE
THIS
SERVES
ON
A
DAILY
BASIS
WHEREIN
THEY
ARE
PRESENTED
AT
PUBLIC
PLACES
IS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
IDENTIFYING
THE
BEARER
THIS
TAKES
PLACE
IN
BANKS
CASHING
CHECKS
POST
OFFICES
REGISTERED
MAIL
AND
SUCH
ETC
QUITE
FRANKLY
IT
WAS
RARE
THAT
I
EVER
HAD
TO
PRESENT
MY
ID
CARD
FOR
SUCH
ACTIVITIES
MORE
THAN
ONCE
PER
WEEK
THERE
IS
NO
LAW
OR
REQUIREMENT
THAT
FORCES
PEOPLE
TO
WAVE
THEIR
ID
CARDS
IN
PUBLIC
FURTHERMORE
NONE
OF
THE
SERVICES
I
OUTLINED
DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST
THE
BEARER
IN
ANY
MANNER
BY
HAVING
ACCESS
TO
THIS
INFORMATION
THE
ONLY
CASE
THAT
I
CAN
THINK
OF
IN
WHICH
THE
LEUM
FIELD
MIGHT
BE
TAKEN
INTO
ACCOUNT
IS
DURING
INTERACTION
WITH
THE
POLICE
BASED
UPON
THE
SCENARIO
IN
GENERAL
THOUGH
ARAB
CITIZENS
ARE
CLEARLY
RECOGNIZABLE
AS
ARE
NONARABS
YOUR
ARGUMENT
THEREFORE
BECOMES
MOOT
UNLESS
YOU
CAN
PROVIDE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
HOW
THIS
FIELD
IS
BEING
USED
TO
DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST
THEM
OFFICIALLY
IN
THE
ANSWER
TO
MY
SECOND
QUESTIONS
CONCERNING
THE
FACT
THAT
ISRAEL
HAS
NO
FIXED
BORDERS
YOU
STATE
THAT
ISRAELS
BORDERS
WERE
SHAPED
AND
RESHAPED
BY
BOTH
WAR
AND
PEACE
ACCORDING
TO
WHAT
I
READ
THE
FIRST
ZIONISTS
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
CENTURY
HAD
PLANS
FOR
THE
JEWISH
STATE
TO
EXTEND
INTO
WHAT
IS
LEBANON
AND
INTO
TRANSJORDAN
JORDAN
I
ALSO
READ
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
EXPRESS
WISH
OF
BENGURION
TO
NOT
DECLARE
ISRAELS
BORDERS
WHEN
ISRAEL
WAS
ESTABLISHED
AS
THIS
MIGHT
RESTRICT
ISRAELS
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
LATER
EXPANSION
ISRAEL
OFTEN
CLAIMS
IT
RIGHT
OF
EXISTENCE
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
JEWS
LIVED
THERE
YEARS
AGO
OR
THAT
GOD
PROMISED
THE
LAND
TO
THEM
BUT
ACCORDING
TO
BIBLICAL
SOURCES
THE
AREA
GOD
PROMISED
WOULD
EXTEND
ALL
THE
WAY
TO
IRAQ
AND
WHAT
WERE
THE
BORDERS
IN
BIBLICAL
TIMES
WHICH
ISRAEL
CONSIDERS
PROPER
TO
USE
TODAY
FINALLY
IF
ISRAEL
WANTS
PEACE
WHY
CANT
IT
DECLARE
WHAT
IT
CONSIDERS
ITS
LEGITIMATE
AND
SECURE
BORDERS
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
A
BASE
FOR
NEGOTIATIONS
HAVING
ALL
THE
ABOVE
FACTS
IN
MIND
ONE
CANNOT
BLAME
ARAB
COUNTRIES
TO
FEAR
ISRAELI
EXPANSIONISM
AS
A
NUMBER
OF
WARS
HAVE
PROVED
I
TAKE
ISSUE
WITH
YOUR
ASSERTIONS
I
THINK
THAT
ARAB
COUNTRIES
DO
KNOW
THAT
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
FEAR
FROM
ISRAELI
EXPANSIONISM
MILITARILY
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
CAPABLE
OF
HOLDING
ONTO
LARGE
TRACTS
OF
LAND
UNDER
OCCUPATION
TO
A
HOSTILE
ARMED
AND
INSURGENT
POPULATION
FOR
A
SUSTAINED
PERIOD
OF
TIME
AS
IS
THE
INTIFADA
IS
HEAVILY
TAXING
THE
ISRAELI
ECONOMY
PROOF
OF
THIS
CAN
BE
SEEN
IN
THE
ISRAELI
WITHDRAWAL
FROM
LEBANON
ISRAELI
TROOPS
PULLED
BACK
FROM
THE
AWALI
AND
LATER
FROM
THE
LITANI
IN
ORDER
TO
CONTROL
THE
MINIMAL
STRIP
NEEDED
TO
KEEP
TOWNS
OUT
OF
RANGE
OF
KATYUSHA
MISSILE
FIRE
PUBLIC
OPINION
IN
ISRAEL
HAS
TURNED
TOWARDS
SETTLING
THE
INTIFADA
VIA
TERRITORIAL
CONCESSIONS
THE
ISRAEL
PUBLIC
IS
SUFFERRING
FROM
BATTLE
FATIGUE
OF
SORTS
AND
THE
GOVT
IS
AWARE
OF
IT
WITH
REGARDS
TO
BORDERS
LET
ME
STATE
THE
FOLLOWING
I
MAY
NOT
AGREE
WITH
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
NEGOTIATIONS
ARE
BEING
HELD
HOWEVER
THE
CRUX
OF
THE
MATTER
IS
THAT
EVERYONE
EITHER
MAKES
OR
REFRAINS
FROM
STATING
A
STARTING
POSITION
THE
ARAB
PARTIES
HAVE
CALLED
FOR
TOTAL
WITHDRAWAL
AND
A
RETURN
TO
BORDERS
IF
ISRAEL
WERE
TO
STATE
LARGE
BORDERS
THE
NEGOTIATIONS
MIGHT
NEVER
GET
UNDER
WAY
IF
ISRAEL
WERE
TO
STATE
SMALLER
BORDERS
THEN
THE
ARAB
COUNTRIES
MIGHT
TRY
AND
FORCE
EVEN
SMALLER
BORDERS
DURING
THE
NEGOTIATIONS
I
THINK
THAT
LEAVING
THE
MATTER
TO
BE
SETTLED
BY
NEGOTIATIONS
AND
PEACE
TREATIES
IS
INFINITELY
MORE
REALISTIC
AND
SENSIBLE
YOUR
ANSWER
TO
MY
THIRD
QUESTION
IS
TYPICAL
OF
A
STALINIST
PUBLIC
OFFICIAL
I
DONT
THINK
YOUR
ANSWER
IS
HONEST
YOU
REFER
ME
TO
VANUNUS
REVELATIONS
ABOUT
ISRAELS
NUCLEAR
ARSENAL
WITHOUT
EVALUATING
THE
TRUTHFULLNESS
OF
HIS
REVELATIONS
NOW
IF
HE
SAID
THE
TRUTH
THEN
WHY
SHOULD
HE
BEEN
PUNISHED
AND
IF
HE
LIED
WHY
SHOULD
HE
BE
PUNISHED
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
MORE
HONESTY
YOUR
STATEMENT
IS
TYPICAL
OF
THE
SIMPLE
MINDED
NAIVETY
OF
A
CENTER
FOR
POLICY
RESEARCH
WHETHER
OR
NOT
ALL
OF
VANUNUS
REVELATIONS
WERE
TRUE
HAS
NO
BEARING
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
WERE
FOR
DISCLOSING
STATE
SECRETS
AFTER
HAVING
SIGNED
CONTRACTS
AND
FORMS
WITH
THE
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
SAID
SECRETS
ARE
NOT
TO
BE
MADE
PUBLIC
ONE
SHOULD
BE
PUNISHED
AS
TO
WHICH
WERE
AND
WHICH
WERENT
I
AM
UNDER
NO
MORAL
OBLIGATION
TO
DISCLOSE
THAT
QUITE
THE
REVERSE
IN
FACT
HE
WAS
TAKEN
TO
COURT
TRIED
AND
FOUND
GUILTY
YOU
MAY
TAKE
ISSUE
WITH
A
NUMBER
OF
THINGS
BUT
CLEARLY
YOU
HAVE
NO
UNDERSTANDING
OF
THE
CONCEPT
OF
SECRETS
OF
STATE
SOMETHING
WHICH
EVERY
DEMOCRATIC
GOVT
HAS
SOMEBODY
PROVIDED
AN
ANSWER
TO
THE
FOURTH
QUESTION
CONCERNING
HIDDEN
PRISONERS
IN
ISRAELI
PRISONS
HE
POSTED
AN
ARTICLE
FROM
MAARIV
DOCUMENTING
SUCH
CASES
IT
SEEMS
THAT
SUCH
PRISONERS
DO
EXIST
IN
ISRAEL
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
ABOUT
THAT
I
NOTICED
THAT
HE
WAS
DOCUMENTING
THE
FACT
THAT
SUCH
PRISONERS
COULD
EXIST
MORE
THAN
HE
DOCUMENTED
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
DO
EXIST
THE
CLU
NOTED
WHICH
YOU
EVIDENTLY
DID
NOT
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
THAT
THEY
KNOW
OF
NO
SUCH
REPORTS
OR
CASES
I
AM
SORRY
TO
TELL
YOU
BUT
IN
A
COUNTRY
OF
MILL
AS
TIGHTLY
KNIT
AS
ISRAEL
EVEN
IF
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
ARREST
WAS
NOT
MADE
PUBLIC
WITHIN
A
RELATIVELY
SHORT
TIME
FRAME
MOST
PEOPLE
WOULD
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
MY
OWN
FEELINGS
ARE
THAT
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
ARREST
SHOULD
BE
MADE
PUBLIC
UNLESS
A
COURT
ORDER
IS
ISSUED
ALLOWING
A
DELAY
OF
X
HOURS
THIS
WOULD
BE
GRANTED
ONLY
IF
A
JUDGE
COULD
BE
CONVINCED
THAT
AN
ANNOUNCEMENT
WOULD
CAUSE
IRREPARABLE
HARM
TO
THE
ONGOING
INVESTIGATION
YOU
IMPLY
THAT
MY
QUESTIONS
SHOW
BIAS
AND
ARE
FORMULATED
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
TO
CAST
ASPERSIONS
UPON
ISRAEL
SUCH
TERMS
HAVE
OFTEN
BEEN
USED
BY
THE
SOVIET
UNION
AGAINST
DISSIDENTS
THEY
CALL
THE
SOVIET
UNION
INTO
DISREPUTE
IF
MY
QUESTIONS
ARE
NOT
DISTURBING
THEY
WOULD
NOT
CALL
FORTH
SUCH
HYSTERICAL
ANSWERS
MY
QUESTIONS
ARE
CLEARLY
PROVOCATIVE
BUT
THEY
ARE
MEANT
TO
SEEK
FACTS
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
HAPPY
IF
YOU
COULD
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
WHAT
I
AM
TOLD
ABOUT
ISRAEL
WERE
JUST
FABRICATIONS
BUT
ALAS
YOU
HAVE
FAILED
TO
DO
SO
I
SUSPECT
THAT
YOU
FEAR
THE
TRUTH
AND
AN
OPEN
AND
HONEST
DISCUSSION
THIS
IS
A
SIGN
OF
WEAKNESS
NOT
OF
STRENGTH
WELL
I
AM
SORRY
TO
SAY
THAT
YOUR
QUESTIONS
ARE
SLANTED
SUCH
QUESTIONS
ARE
OFTEN
TERMED
TABLOID
JOURNALISM
AND
ARE
NOT
DISTURBING
BECAUSE
THEY
AVOID
ANY
ATTEMPT
AT
OBJECTIVITY
SUCH
QUESTIONS
WERE
OFTEN
USED
DURING
THE
MCCARTHY
ERA
AS
A
BASIS
FOR
THE
WITCHHUNTS
THAT
TOOK
PLACE
THEN
TO
USE
YOUR
OWN
EXAMPLE
THESE
QUESTIONS
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
LIFTED
FROM
THE
FORMAT
USED
BY
STALINIST
PROSECUTORS
THAT
WERE
LOOKING
FOR
SMALL
BITS
OF
EVIDENCE
THAT
THEY
COULD
DISTORT
AND
PORTRAY
AS
A
LARGER
AND
DIRTIER
PICTURE
MY
ANSWERS
WERE
NOT
ANY
MORE
HYSTERICAL
THAN
THE
QUESTIONS
THEMSELVES
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
THAT
THE
QS
WERE
PROVOCATIVE
IT
WAS
THAT
THEY
WERE
SELECTIVE
IN
THEIR
FACT
SEEKING
YOU
FALL
INTO
THE
SAME
CATEGORY
OF
THOSE
WHO
SEEK
YES
NO
ANSWERS
WHEN
THE
REAL
ANSWER
IS
OF
SORTS
I
SUSPECT
THAT
AS
LONG
AS
THE
ANSWERS
TO
THESE
QUESTIONS
IS
NOT
AN
UNEQUIVOCAL
NO
YOU
WOULD
REMAIN
UNSATIFIED
AND
CHOOSE
TO
INTERPRETE
THEM
AS
YOU
SEE
FIT
A
SIGN
OF
STRENGTH
IS
THE
ABILITY
TO
LOOK
YOU
REMIND
ME
OF
THOSE
MISTAKEN
ENVIRONMENTALISTS
WHO
ONCE
ADVOCATED
CULLING
WOLVES
BECAUSE
OF
THE
CRUELTY
TO
DEER
ONLY
TO
FIND
THAT
THEY
HAD
BROKEN
THE
FOOD
CHAIN
AND
WREAKED
HAVOC
UPON
THE
VERY
ENVIRONMENT
THEY
SOUGHT
TO
PROTECT
THE
COLOR
BLINDNESS
YOU
EXHIBIT
IS
A
TRUE
SIGN
OF
WEAKNESS
I
HOPE
YOU
WILL
MUSTER

COURAGE

SEEK
