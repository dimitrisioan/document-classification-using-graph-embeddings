PLEASE
SHOW

IN
WASHINGTON

FOR
BOSNIA
MAY
MICHAEL
SELLS

WRITES
THIS
IS
NOT
A
FRESH
CASE
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
BUT
JUST
ANOTHER
CHAPTER
IN
THE
CONTINUING
SAGA
OF
INTENSE
MUTUAL
HATRED
DESTRUCTION
EVERY
PLACE
ON
EARTH
IS
THE
SCENE
OF
A
SAGA
OF
MUTUAL
HATRED
AND
DESTRUCTION
THE
HOLOCAUST
WAS
NOT
A
FRESH
CASE
IT
WAS
ANOTHER
CHAPTER
IN
A
YEAR
HISTORY
OF
ATTACKS
ON
JEWS
IN
EUROPE
THAT
DIDNT
MAKE
IT
ACCEPTABLE
AND
BALKAN
HISTORY
DOES
NOT
MAKE
THE
GENOCIDE
AGAINST
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
ACCEPTABLE
I
GUESS
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
BECAUSE
GERMANY
ALSO
CHOSE
A
PATH
OF
AGGRESSION
SIMULTANEOUSLY
THAT
PUT
THE
INTERESTS
OF
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
PERIL
I
WONDER
WHETHER
US
OR
OTHER
COUNTRIES
WOULD
HAVE
RISKED
THEMSELVES
IF
ONLY
JEWS
WERE
PERSECUTED
AND
HITLER
HAD
NO
IMPERIALIST
AMBITIONS
I
AM
NO
STUDENT
OF
HISTORY
AND
I
AM
JUST
ASKING
QUESTIONS
IF
EVEN
FOR
A
MOMENT
YOU
THINK
THAT
I
AM
CONDOING
ETHNICALLY
MOTIVATED
VIOLENCE
AND
KILLINGS
YOU
ARE
DEAD
WRONG
LET
ME
ASSURE
I
AM
NOT
MY
ONLY
QUESTION
IS
THIS
DO
POWERFUL
COUNTRIES
HAVE
A
MORAL
OBLIGATION
TO
INTEREFERE
IN
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IF
THEIR
OWN
INTERESTS
ARE
NOT
THREATENED
I
CITE
AN
ESSAY
BY
CHARLES
KRAUTHAMMER
IN
THE
TIME
THIS
WEEK
THAT
DISCUSSES
THIS
ISSUE
ELOQUENTLY
FOR
EXAMPLE
DID
US
AND
OTHER
EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES
ABANDON
THEIR
MORAL
COMPUNCTIONS
WHEN
THEY
CHOSE
NOT
TO
SEND
MILITARY
TROOPS
TO
BOMBAY
WHEN
HINDUS
IN
A
RARE
FIT
OF
IMPASSIONED
RAGE
KILLED
MANY
MUSLIMS
RECENTLY
I
THINK
NOT
UNDER
WHAT
CONDITIONS
SHOULD
US
INTERFERE
IN
FOREGIN
COUNTRIES
IS
AN
ABSTRACTION
ONE
MUST
CLARIFY
BEFORE
RESORTING
TO
ACRIMONIOUS
ACCUSATIONS
OF
RELIGIOUS
BIGOTRY
AND
SUCH
SATYA
PRABHAKAR
