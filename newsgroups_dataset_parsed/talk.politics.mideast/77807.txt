the
arab
association
for
human
rights
hra
was
formed
in
to
address
discriminatory
practices
and
human
rights
abuses
by
israel
against
its
palestinian
citizens
it
is
a
unique
association
concerned
with
the
civil
political
economic
social
and
cultural
rights
of
the
palestinian
national
minority
in
israel
among
the
issues
of
concern
are
land
confiscation
education
prison
conditions
unemployment
torture
and
the
unequal
allocation
of
israels
resources
today
there
are
around
palestinian
arabs
living
within
the
green
line
the
borders
of
israel
constituting
of
israels
citizens
for
them
it
is
an
empty
citizenship
in
a
system
geared
exclusively
for
the
needs
of
the
jewish
population
legally
and
practically
israel
has
proclaimed
itself
a
jewish
state
and
early
promises
of
equality
for
nonjewish
citizens
have
not
been
fulfilled
this
is
apparent
in
many
areas
strongly
affecting
the
palestinian
national
minority
most
arab
agricultural
land
has
been
confiscated
since
the
arab
sector
is
vastly
underfunded
and
does
not
receive
a
fair
share
of
state
resources
on
a
dayto
day
level
palestinians
face
discrimination
in
many
different
forms
and
find
it
is
a
struggle

a
business
find
a
job
or
educate
their
children
