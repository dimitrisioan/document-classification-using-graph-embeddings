history

within

greeks
played

instigate

resulted

ritual

attacks
against

carried
out
mostly
by
native
greeks
armenians
and
in

provinces
by
maronites
and
other
arab
christians
often
with
the
assistance
of
the
local
european
consuls
took
place
throughout
the

there
were
literally
thousands
of
incidents
continuously
until

as

as

and

at

and
in
all
the
arab
provinces
as
far
south
as
damascus
and
beirut
and
in
egypt
at
cairo
and
alexandria
these
invariably
resulted
from
accusations
spread
among
ottoman
christians
by
word
of
mouth
or
published
in
their
newspapers
often
by
christian
financiers
and
merchants
anxious
to
get

competitors
out

muslim
anger
at

of

massacres
of

in

resulting
in
individual
and
mob
attacks
on

and
the
burning
of

shops
and
homes
individual
experiences
were
horrible
jews
constantly
went
in
fear
of
armenian
or
greek
attacks
in
the
streets
of
ottoman
cities
in
egypt
and
syria
it
was
usually
the
greeks
who
led
the
way
in
many
cases
with
the
assistance
of
local
armenians
and
syrian
christians
whose
greek
arabic
and
frenchlanguage
newspapers
often
printed
all
the
rumors
they
could
find
regarding
jews
evidently
with
the
desire
of
instigating
violence
the
syrian
arab
christians
in
particular
spread
their
longstanding
antisemitic
hatreds
from
syria
to
egypt
where
their
monopoly
of
the
local
press
and
their
espousal
of
popular
causes
such
as
egyptian
nationalism
and
opposition
to
the
british
rule
enabled
them
to
spread
their
antijewish
message
among
the
muslim
masses
with
little
question
or
opposition
on
june
thus
sir
evelyn
baring
later
lord
cromer
british
high

in

received
the
following
report
from

and
nissim

in

sir
i
beg
sir
to
draw
to
your
attention
to
the
violent
articles
which
has
sic
appeared
in
an
arabic
paper
called
el
mahroussa
which
contained
nothing
but
lies
and
false
accusations
against
the
jews
especially
those
the
issues
of
the
and
instant
now
sir
are
we
to
have
here
an
antisemitic
party
amidst
fanaticism
greeks
armenians
etc
or
is
he
to
be
allowed
to
continue
to
poison
the
peoples
minds
with
exaggeration
and
painted
words
in
an
article
he
asserted
that
the
jews
use
christian
blood
for
passover
of
course
this
has
caused
a
deal
of
excitement
whenever
greek
and
other
orthodox
religious
authorities
or
prominent
greek
business
leaders
or
consuls
were
asked
to
help
to
stem
the
violence
or
reduce
tension
they
invariably
indicated
their
cooperation
and
then
failed
to
do
anything
to
prevent
attacks
or
punish
those
who
stimulated
or
led
them
