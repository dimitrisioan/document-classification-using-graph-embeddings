i
believe
it
was
the
number

feeling
european
i
made
a
typo
which
i
corrected
with
another

right
afterwards
so
what
poor

i
see
youre
preparing
the
groundwork
for
yet
another
retreat
from
your
arromdianasalasdpaarf
claims
hasan
b

and
serdar
argic
has
been
posting
stuff
that
can
only
be
attributed
to
typographical
errors
for
the
past
just
love
it
if
that
does
ever
happen
look
out

window
and
see
if
there
is
a
nonfascistnazi
xsoviet
armenian
government
in
the
east
by
the
way
your
ignorance
on
the

genocide
of
million

is

it
seems
that
terrorism
against
their
own
conationals
has
been
a
prominent
part
of
the
revolutionary
activities
of
the
dashnag
leaders
of
the
caucasus
organized
to
fight
the
turks
these
chieftains
have
been
more
successful
in
their
fight
against
their
armenian
opponents
in
turkey
and
the
caucasus
very
often
defenseless
and
innocent
p
the
fact
remains
however
that
the
leaders
of
the
turkish
armenian
section
of
the
dashnagtzoutune
did
not
carry
out
their
promise
of
loyalty
to
the
turkish
cause
when
the
turks
entered
the
warand
a
call
was
sent
for
armenian
volunteers
to
fight
the
turks
on
the
caucasian
front
p
thousands
of
armenians
from
all
over
the
world
flocked
to
the
standards
of
such
famous
fighters
as
antranik
kery
