WRITES
IT
IS
NOT
A
TERRORIST
CAMP
AS
YOU
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
LIKE
TO
VIEW
THE
VILLAGES
THEY
ARE
SMALL
COMMUNITIES
WITH
KIDS
PLAYING
SOCCER
IN
THE
STREETS
WOMEN
PREPARING
LUNCH
MEN
PLAYING
CARDS
ETC
SOME
YOUNG
MEN
USUALLY
AGED
BETWEEN
TO
YEARS
ARE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
EVEN
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
VILLAGE
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHO
THESE
ARE
THEY
ARE
SECRETIVE
ABOUT
IT
BUT
MOST
PEOPLE
OFTEN
SUSPECT
WHO
THEY
ARE
AND
WHAT
THEY
ARE
UP
TO
THESE
YOUNG
MEN
ARE
SUPPORTED
FINANCIALLY
BY
IRAN
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THEY
SNEAK
ARMS
AND
AMMUNITIONS
INTO
THE
OCCUPIED
ZONE
WHERE
THEY
SET
UP
BOOBY
TRAPS
FOR
ISRAELI
PATROLS
EVERY
TIME
AN
ISRAELI
SOLDIER
IS
KILLED
OR
INJURED
BY
THESE
TRAPS
ISRAEL
RETALLIATES
BY
INDISCRIMINATELY
BOMBING
VILLAGES
OF
THEIR
OWN
CHOOSING
OFTEN
KILLING
ONLY
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
THIS
A
TRIED
AND
TRUE
METHOD
UTILIZED
BY
GUERILLA
AND
TERRORISTS
GROUPS
TO
CONDUCT
OPERATIONS
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
LOCAL
POPULACE
THUS
FORCING
THE
OPPOSING
STATE
TO
POSSIBLE
HARM
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
IN
THEIR
SEARCH
OR
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
THE
DEATHS
OF
CIVILIANS
ABANDON
THE
SEARCH
CERTAINLY
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ARE
ALSO
TO
BLAIM
FOR
DRAGGING
THE
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
INTO
HARMS
WAY
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
WHEN
GUERILLAS
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ISRAEL
SHOULD
TOTALLY
BACK
DOWN
SOTHE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
ATTACKING
ANOTHER
IS
TO
USE
AN
INNOCENT
AS
A
SHIELD
AND
HOPE
THAT
THE
OTHER
RESPECTS
INNOCENT
LIVES
TELL
ME
TIM
WHAT
ARE
THESE
GUERILLAS
DOING
WRONG
ASSUMING
THAT
THEY
ARE
USING
CIVILIANS
FOR
COVER
ARE
THEY
NOT
KILLING
SOLDIERS
IN
THEIR
COUNTRY
IF
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
IS
TO
PREVENT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
IS
IT
NOT
WORKING
WHY
IS
IT
FURTHER
NECCESSARY
FOR
ISRAELI
GUNS
TO
POUND
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
WHY
NOT
JUST
KILL
THOSE
WHO
TRY
TO
INFILTRATE
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
YOU
SEE
THERE
IS
MORE
TO
THE
SHELLING
OF
THE
VILLAGES
IT
IS
CALLED
RETALIATION
GETTING
BACK
GETTING
EVEN
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
SHELL
THE
VILLAGES
THE
LEAST
IT
SHOWS
IS
A
RECKLESS
DISREGARD
BY
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
FOR
THE
LIVES
OF
CIVILIANS
PLEASE
CLARIFY
YOUR
STANDARDS
FOR
RULES
OF
ENGAGEMENT
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
ISRAELIS
ARE
AT
ALL
TIMES
AND
UNDER
ALL
CIRCUMSTANCES
FAIR
TARGETS
THEIR
OPPONENTS
ARE
LEGITIMATE
TARGETS
ONLY
WHEN
MIRANDIZED
OR
SOME
SUCH
IM
SURE
THAT
THIS
MAKES
PERFECT
SENSE
IF
YOU
GRANT
APRIORI
THAT
ISRAELIS
ARE
THE
BLACK
HATS
AND
THAT
THEREFORE
KILLING
THEM
IS
AUTOMATICALLY
A
GOOD
THING
GO
HEZBOLLAH
THE
COROLLARY
IS
THAT
THE
HEZBOLLAH
ARE
THE
WHITE
HATS
AND
THAT
WHATEVER
THEY
DO
IS
A
GOOD
THING
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
ONLY
PROVE
THEMSELVES
TO
BE
BAD
GUYS
BY
ATTACKING
THEM
THIS
SOUNDS
SUSPICIOUSLY
LIKE
A
HOCKEY
FAN
I
KNOW
WHO
CHEERS
WHEN
ONE
OF
THE
PLAYERS
ON
HIS
TEAM
USES
HIS
STICK
TO
PERMANENTLY
REARRANGE
AN
OPPONENTS
FACE
AND
CURSES
THE
REF
FOR
PENALIZING
HIS
SIDE

ITS
