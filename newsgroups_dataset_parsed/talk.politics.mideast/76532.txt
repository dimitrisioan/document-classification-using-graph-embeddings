IS
ISRAELS
OCCUPATION
OF
SOUTHERN
LEBANON
TEMPORARY
ISRAEL
HAS
REPEATEDLY
STATED
THAT
IT
WILL
LEAVE
LEBANON
WHEN
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
CAN
PROVIDE
GUARANTEES
THAT
ISRAEL
WILL
NOT
BE
ATTACKED
FROM
LEBANESE
SOIL
AND
WHEN
THE
SYRIANS
LEAVE
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
SYRIA
AND
LEBANON
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
DETERMINE
IF
THEY
WISH
TO
RETURN
TO
THE
SITUATION
PRIOR
TO
THE
FRENCH
INVASION
WHERE
THEY
WERE
BOTH
PART
OF
THE
SAME
MANDATE
TERRITORY
READ
COLONY
AND
LEBANON
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
MAKE
THIS
DECISION
WITHOUT
SYRIAN
TROOPS
CONTROLLING
THE
COUNTRY
UNTIL
SYRIA
LEAVES
AND
FREE
ELECTIONS
TAKE
PLACE
ITS
IS
REDICULOUS
TO
CLAIM
THAT
THE
LEBANESE
WOULD
EVEN
BE
INVOLVED
IN
DETERMINING
WHAT
HAPPENS
TO
THEIR
COUNTRY
ISRAEL
HAS
NO
RIGHT
TO
DETERMINE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IN
LEBANON
INVADING
ANOTHER
COUNTRY
BECAUSE
YOU
CONSIDER
THEM
A
THREAT
IS
PRECISELY
THE
WAY
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
WARS
OF
AGGRESSION
HAVE
STARTED
I
EXPECT
YOU
WILL
AGREE
THAT
THE
SAME
HOLDS
TRUE
FOR
SYRIA
HAVING
NO
RIGHT
TO
BE
IN
LEBANON
ISRAEL
HAS
ALREADY
ANNEXED
AREAS
TAKEN
OVER
IN
THE
WAR
THESE
AREAS
ARE
NOT
OCCUPIED
BUT
DISPUTED
SINCE
THERE
IS
NO
LEGITAMATE
GOVERNING
BODY
CITIZENSHIP
WAS
GIVEN
TO
THOSE
RESIDENTS
IN
ANNEXED
AREAS
WHO
WANTED
CITIZENSHIP
THE
UN
DEFINES
THEM
AS
OCCUPIED
THEY
ARE
RECOGNISED
AS
SUCH
BY
EVERY
NATION
ON
EARTH
EXCLUDING
ONE
SMALL
CARIBEAN
ISLAND
THE
UN
ALSO
THOUGHT
ZIONISM
IS
RACISM
THAT
FAILS
TO
MAKE
IT
TRUE
THE
FIRST
REASON
WAS
SECURITY
A
LARGE
JEWISH
PRESENSE
MAKES
IT
DIFFICULT
FOR
TERRORISTS
TO
INFILTRATE
A
JEWISH
SETTLEMENTS
ALSO
ACT
AS
FORTRESSES
IN
TIMES
OF
WAR
THEYU
ALSO
ARE
A
LIABILITY
WE
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
CIVILIAN
ENCAMPMENTS
THAT
WOULD
LAST
NO
MORE
THAN
HOURS
AGAINST
TANKS
THEY
LASTED
WEEKS
AGAINST
TANKS
IN
AND
STOPPED
THOSE
TANKS
FROM
ADVANCING
THEY
ALSO
LASTED
DAYS
IN
THERE
IS
LITTLE
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
CLAIM
THAT
THEY
ARE
MILITARY
LIABILITIES
THEY
EVIDENCE
IS
THERE
TO
SHOW
THAT
WHEN
INFILTRATIONS
TAKE
PLACE
OVER
THE
JORDAN
RIVER
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
LARGE
PATROLLED
KIBUTZIM
FORCES
TERRORISTS
INTO
A
VERY
SMALL
AREA
WHERE
THEY
ARE
USUALLY
PICKED
UP
IN
THE
MORNING
A
SECOND
REASON
WAS
POLITICAL
CREATING
SETTLEMENTS
BROUGHT
THE
ARABS
TO
THE
NEGOTIATION
TABLE
HAD
THE
CREATION
OF
NEW
TOWNS
AND
CITIES
GONE
ON
ANOTHER
SEVERAL
YEARS
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
PLACE
LEFT
IN
ISRAEL
WHERE
THERE
WAS
AN
ARAB
MAJORITY
THERE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NO
LAND
LEFT
THAT
COULD
BE
CALLED
ARAB
DONT
FOOL
YOURSELF
IT
WAS
THE
GULF
WAR
THAT
BROUGHT
THE
ISRAELIS
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
ONCE
THEIR
US
BACKERS
HAD
A
SECURE
BASE
IN
THE
GULF
THEY
INSRTRUCTED
SHAMIR
TO
NEGOTIATE
OR
ELSE
NONSENSE
ISRAEL
HAS
BEEN
TRYING
TO
GET
ITS
NEIGHBORS
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
FOR
YEARS
IT
WAS
THE
GULF
WAR
THAT
BROUGHT
THE
ARABS
TO
THE
TABLE
NOT
THE
ISRAELIS
THE
POINT
IS
THERE
ARE
MANY
REASONS
PEOPLE
MOVED
OVER
THE
GREEN
LINE
AND
MANY
REASONS
THE
GOVERNMENT
WANTED
THEM
TO
WHATEVER
STATUS
IS
NEGOTIATED
FOR
DISPUTED
TERRITORIES
IT
WILL
NOT
BE
AN
ALL
OR
NOTHING
DEAL
NEW
BOUNDARIES
WILL
BE
DRAWN
UP
BY
NEGOTIATION
NOT
BE
THE
RESULTS
OF
A
WAR
UNLESS
THE
NEW
BOUNDARIES
DRAWN
UP
ARE
THOSE
OF
THERE
WILL
BE
NO
PEACE
ARAFFAT
HAS
PRECIOUS
LITTLE
AUTHORITY
TO
AGREE
TO
ANYTHING
ELSE
NONSENSE
ACCORDING
TO

ISRAEL
MUST
BE
DESTROYED
HE
HAS
NEVER
COME
CLEAN
AND
DENIED
THAT
THIS
IS
HIS
PLAN
HE
ALWAYS
WAFFLES
ON
WHAT
HE
MEANS
WHEN
THE
ARABS
SET
OFF
THEIR
VOLCANO
THERE
WILL
ONLY
BE
ARABS
IN
THIS
PART
OF
THE
WORLD
OUR
PEOPLE
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
FUEL
THE
TORCH
OF
THE

WITH
