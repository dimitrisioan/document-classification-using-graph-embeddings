ARMENIAAZERIS
WRITES
MR
TAMAMIDIS
BEFORE
REPLING
YOUR
CLAIMS
I
SUGGEST
YOU
BE
KIND
TO
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
ARE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
SOME
POINTS
ABOUTS
HUMAN
RIGHTS
DISCRIMINATIONS
AND
UNEQUAL
TREATMENT
OF
TURKISH
MINORITY
IN
GREECEI
WANT
THE
WORLD
KNOW
HOW
BAD
YOU
TREAT
THESE
PEOPLE
YOU
WILL
DENY
ANYTHING
I
SAY
BUT
IT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
ANY
DIFRENCE
BECAUSE
I
WILL
WRITE
THINGS
THAT
I
SAW
WITH
MY
EYESYOU
PROVE
YOURSELF
PREJUDICE
BY
SAYING
FREE
INSURANCE
SCHOOL
ETC
DO
YOU
GREEKS
ONLY
GIVE
THESE
THINGS
TO
TURKISH
MINORITY
OR
EVERYBODY
HAS
RIGHTS
TO
GET
THEMYOUR
WORDS
EVEN
DISCRIMINATE
THESE
PEOPLE
YOU
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
GIVING
BIG
FAVOR
TO
THESE
PEOPLE
BY
GIVING
THESE
THING
THAT
IN
REALITY
THEY
GET
NOTHING
NO
I
DO
NOT
THING
WE
ARE
DOING
THEM
A
FAVOR
I
HAVE
SIMPLY
STATED
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
TREATED
AS
A
SECOND
CLASS
CITIZENS
THAT
WAS
MY
POINT
I
FAIL
TO
SEE
HOW
MY
WORDS
SHOW
DISCRIMINATION
AND
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
THAT
THEY
DO
NOT
GET
NOTHING
IS
FOR
EXAMPLE
HELTH
INSURANCE
FOOD
AND
TUITION
NOTHING
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
KNOW
UNHUMAN
PRACTICES
THAT
ARE
BEING
CONDUCTED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
THE
GREECE
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
INVESTIGATE
TO
SEE
THE
FACTS
THEN
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
ABOUT
THE
MOST
BASIC
HUMAN
RIGHTS
LIKE
FREDOM
OF
RELIGION
FREDOM
OF
PRESS
OF
TURKISH
MINORITY
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
OF
ALL
TURKS
IN
GREECEFREDOM
OF
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
PROPERTY
WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
FREDOM
OF
RIGHT
TO
VOTE
TO
CHOOSE
YOUR
COMMUNITY
LEADERS
HOW
GREEK
GOVERNMENT
ENCOURAGES
PEOPLE
TO
DESTROY
RELIGIOUS
PLACES
HOUSES
FARMS
SCHOOLS
FOR
TURKISH
MINORITY
THEN
FORCING
THEM
TO
GO
TO
TURKEY
WITHOUT
ANYTHING
WITH
THEM
IM
SORRY
BUT
I
CANNOT
SEE
ANY
LOGICAL
ORDER
IN
THE
ABOVE
ARGUMENT
BEFORE
I
CONCLUDE
MY
WRITING
LET
ME
POINT
OUT
HOW
GREEKS
ARE
TREATED
IN
TURKEY
WE
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THEM
GREEK
MINORITY
INSTEAD
WE
CONSIDER
A
PART
OF
OUR
SOCIETY
WHAT
PART
EXACTLY
IS
THIS
ONE
THE
PEOPLE
CANNOT
EVEN
SELL
THEIR
PROPERTY
IF
THEY
WANT
TO
LEAVE
TURKEY
THE
PATRIARCH
COULD
NOT
GET
A
PERMISION
TO
RENOVATE
SOME
BUILDINGS
FOR
DECADES
IT
NEEDED
A
SPECIAL
AGREEMENT
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
GOVERMENTS
FOR
THIS
TALK
ABOUT
A
PART
OF
THE
SOCIETY
WHY
HAS
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
GREEK
COMMUNITY
REDUCED
TO
OLD
PEOPLE
AND
PRIESTS
THEN
THERE
IS
NO
DIFFERENCE
AMONG
PEOPLE
IN
TURKEY
YEAH
YOU
BET
ALL
BIG
BUSINESSES
BELONG
TO
GREEKS
IN
TURKEY
AND
WE
ARE
PROUD
TO
HAVE
THEMUNLIKE
THE
GREECE
WHICH
TRIES
TO
DESTROY
TURKISH
MINORITY
WE
ENCOURAGE
ALL
MINORITIES
IN
TURKEY
TO
BE
A
PART
OF
TURKISH
SOCIETY
YOU
ARE
FAR
OFF
FROM
THE
REALITY
