RE
ABOUT
THIS
CENTER
FOR
POLICY
RESEA
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
MANY
READERS
OF
THIS
CONFERENCE
ARE
INTERESTED
WHO
IS
BEHIND
THE
CENTER
FOR
POLICT
RESEARCH
I
WILL
OBLIGE
MY
NAME
IS
ELIAS
DAVIDSSON
ICELANDIC
CITIZEN
BORN
IN
PALESTINE
MY
MOTHER
WAS
THROWN
FROM
GERMANY
BECAUSE
SHE
BELONGED
TO
THE
UNDESIRABLES
AT
THAT
TIMES
THIS
GROUP
WAS
DEFINED
AS
JEWS
SHE
WAS
FORCED
TO
GO
TO
PALESTINE
DUE
TO
MANY
CYNICAL
FACTORS
I
HAVE
MEANWHILE
SETTLED
IN
ICELAND
YEARS
AGO
AND
MET
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
THROWN
OUT
FROM
MY
HOMELAND
PALESTINE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SAME
REASON
THEY
BELONGED
TO
THE
INDESIRABLES
THESE
PEOPLE
INCLUDE
MY
NEIGHBORS
IN
JERUSALEM
WITH
THE
CHILDREN
OF
WHOM
I
PLAYED
AS
CHILD
THEIR
CRIME
THEYARE
NOT
JEWS
MY
CONSCIENCE
DOES
NOT
ACCEPT
SUCH
INJUSTICE
PERIOD
MY
WORK
FOR
JUSTICE
IS
DONE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
MY
PRINCIPLED
OPPOSITION
TO
RACISM
AND
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
THOSE
WHO
PROTEST
AGAINST
SUCH
PRACTICES
IN
ARAB
COUNTRIES
HAVE
MY
SUPPORT
AS
LONG
AS
THEIR
PROTEST
IS
BASED
ON
A
PRINCIPLED
POSITION
BUT
NOT
AS
A
TACTIC
TO
DEFLECT
CRITICISM
FROM
ISRAEL
THE
STRUGGLE
AGAINST
DISCRIMINATION
AND
RACISM
IS
UNIVERSAL
THE
CENTER
FOR
POLICY
RESEARCH
IS
A
NAME
I
GAVE
TO
THOSE
ACTIVITIES
UNDERTAKEN
UNDER
MY
GUIDANCE
IN
DIFFERENT
DOMAINS
AND
WHICH
COMMAND
THE
SUPPORT
OF
MANY
VOLUNTEERS
IN
ICELAND
IT
IS
HOWEVER
NOT
A
FORMAL
INSTITUTION
AND
WORKS
WITH
MINIMAL
FUNDS
PROFESSIONALLY
I
AM
MUSIC
TEACHER
AND
COMPOSER
I
HAVE
PUBLISHED
SEVERAL
PIECES
AND
MY
PIANO
MUSIC
IS
TAUGHT
WIDELY
IN
EUROPE
I
WOULD
HOPE
THAT
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
ISRAELPALESTINE
BE
CONDUCTED
IN
A
MORE
CIVILIZED
MANNER
CALLING
NAMES
IS
NOT
HELPFUL
