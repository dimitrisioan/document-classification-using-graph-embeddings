ten
questions
about
israel
ten
questions
to
israelis
i
would
be
thankful
if
any
of
you
who
live
in
israel
could
help
to
provide
accurate
answers
to
the
following
specific
questions
these
are
indeed
provocative
questions
but
they
are
asked
time
and
again
by
people
around
me
is
it
true
that
the
israeli
authorities
dont
recognize
israeli
nationality
and
that
id
cards
which
israeli
citizens
must
carry
at
all
times
identify
people
as
jews
or
arabs
not
as
israelis
although
the
hebrew
expression
leum
is
used
the
id
card
specifically
states
on
the
page
ezrachut
yisrealit
israeli
citizen
this
is
true
for
all
israeli
citizens
no
matter
what
their
ethnicity
in
the
united
states
most
official
forms
have
race
caucasian
black
amerindian
etc
is
it
true
that
the
state
of
israel
has
no
fixed
borders
and
that
israeli
governments
from
until
today
have
refused
to
state
where
the
ultimate
borders
of
the
state
of
israel
should
be
funny
i
have
a
number
of
maps
and
all
of
them
have
fixed
borders
is
it
true
that
israeli
stocks
nuclear
weapons
if
so
could
you
provide
any
evidence
probably
yes
so
what
is
it
true
that
in
israeli
prisons
there
are
a
number
of
individuals
which
were
tried
in
secret
and
for
which
their
identities
the
date
of
their
trial
and
their
imprisonment
are
state
secrets
apart
from
mordechai
vanunu
who
had
a
trial
behind
closed
doors
there
was
one
other
espionage
case
the
nutty
professor
at
the
nes
ziona
biological
institute
who
was
a
kgb
mole
who
was
tried
in
camera
i
wouldnt
exactly
call
it
a
state
secret
the
trial
was
simply
tried
behind
closed
doors
i
hate
to
disappoint
you
but
the
united
states
has
tried
a
number
of
espionage
cases
in
camera
is
it
true
that
jews
who
reside
in
the
occupied
territories
are
subject
to
different
laws
than
nonjews
not
jews
israeli
citizens
jordanian
law
is
in
effect
in
the
west
bank
but
the
knesset
passed
a
law
that
israeli
law
would
be
binding
on
israeli
citizens
residing
in
the
west
bank
these
citizens
could
be
jews
israeli
muslims
druze
or
israeli
christians
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
religion
is
it
true
that
jews
who
left
palestine
in
the
war
to
avoid
the
war
were
automatically
allowed
to
return
while
their
christian
neighbors
who
did
the
same
were
not
allowed
to
return
anyone
who
was
registered
jew
muslim
christian
could
return
you
might
be
confusing
this
with
the
census
taken
in
june
on
the
west
bank
after
the
six
day
war
in
this
instance
if
the
arab
was
not
physically
present
he
couldnt
reside
on
the
west
bank
eg
if
he
had
been
visting
jordan
is
it
true
that
israels
prime
minister
y
rabin
signed
an
order
for
ethnical
cleansing
in
as
is
done
today
in
bosniaherzegovina
no
not
even
if
you
drowned
him
in
bourbon
scotch
or
brandy
is
it
true
that
israeli
arab
citizens
are
not
admitted
as
members
in
kibbutzim
not
true
although
a
minority
there
are
some
israeli
arabs
living
on
kibbutzim
on
the
other
hand
at
my
age
i
wouldnt
be
admitted
to
a
kibbutz
nor
could
the
family
join
me
not
that
i
would
be
so
thrilled
to
do
so
in
the
first
place
the
kibbbutz
movement
places
candidates
under
rigorous
membership
criteria
many
israeli
jews
are
not
admitted
is
it
true
that
israeli
law
attempts
to
discourage
marriages
between
jews
and
nonjews
the
religious
status
quo
in
israel
has
marriage
and
divorce
handled
by
the
religious
courts
the
rabbanut
handles
marriage
and
divorce
for
jews
the
muslim
shaaria
courts
are
for
muslims
the
christian
denominations
have
their
religious
courts
and
the
druze
have
their
own
courts
the
entire
religious
establishment
jewish
muslim
druze
christian
wants
to
keep
it
that
way
is
it
true
that
hotel
hilton
in
tel
aviv
is
built
on
the
site
of
a
muslim
cemetery
i
believe
its
adjacent
to
a
former
muslim
cemetary
from
what
i
heard
and
id
like
to
get
feedback
from
muslins
on
the
net
sanctity
of
cemetaries
is
not
held
that
sancrosanct
as
it
is
held
by
jews
the
current
israeli
ministry
of
trade
and
industry
on
agron
road
in
jerusalem
is
housed
in
a
former
hotel
that
was
built
by
arabs
in
the
on
the
site
of
an
arab
cemetary
