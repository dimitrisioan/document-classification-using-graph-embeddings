other
people
have
commented
on
most
of
this
swill
i
figured
id
add
a
few
comments
of
my
own
the
gaza
strip
this
tiny
area
of
land
with
the
highest
population
density
in
the
world
has
been
cut
off
from
the
world
for
weeks
hong
kong
and
cairo
both
have
higher
population
densities
the
israeli
occupier
has
decided
to
punish
the
whole
population
of
gaza
some
people
by
denying
them
the
right
to
leave
the
strip
and
seek
work
in
israel
there
is
no
fundamental
right
to
work
in
another
country
and
the
closing
of
the
strip
is
not
a
punishment
it
is
a
security
measure
to
stop
people
from
stabbing
israelis
the
only
help
given
to
gazans
by
israeli
jews
only
dozens
of
people
is
humanitarian
assistance
dozens
minus
one
since
one
of
them
was
stabbed
to
death
a
few
days
ago

if
we
had
a
budget
big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual
favors
we

wouldnt
waste
them
on
