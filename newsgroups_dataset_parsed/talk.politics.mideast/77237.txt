WRITES
OR
FOR
THAT
MATTER
WITH
THE
USA
AROUND
HERE
NOBODY
REROUTES
FREEWAYS
TO
AVOID
CHURCHES
SYNAGOGUES
AND
SO
FORTH
THEY
JUST
GET
CONDEMNED
PAID
OFF
AND
THE
ROAD
GOES
THROUGH
THE
SAME
IS
STANDARD
POLICY
FOR
ANY
NUMBER
OF
OTHER
PUBLIC
PROJECTS
SCHOOLS
AND
SPORTS
ARENAS
BEING
ONLY
TWO
EXAMPLES
ANTICIPATING
THE
OBJECTION
THAT
THE

ARENT
COMPARABLE
HOW
NOT
THE

TO
COUNT
AS
THE
TOURIST
ATTRACTION
IN

WERE
GIVEN
ONLY
TWO
OR
THREE
HOURS
NOTICE
TO
PACK
UP
AND
FIND
ACCOMODATIONS
ELSEWHERE
THEY
HAD
NO
CHANCE
OF
PUBLIC
HEARING
DEBATE
APPEAL
NEGOTIATION
OR
ANYTHING
IT
WAS
GET
OUT
OR
DIE
