writes
or
for
that
matter
with
the
usa
around
here
nobody
reroutes
freeways
to
avoid
churches
synagogues
and
so
forth
they
just
get
condemned
paid
off
and
the
road
goes
through
the
same
is
standard
policy
for
any
number
of
other
public
projects
schools
and
sports
arenas
being
only
two
examples
anticipating
the
objection
that
the
cases
arent
comparable
how
not
the
wall
has
to
count
as
the
tourist
attraction
in
that
part
of
the
world
making
room
for
the
traffic
would
be
a
twenty
second
decision
for
any
city
council
i
ever
heard
of
the
cases
arent
really
comparable
a
project
like
a
freeway
requires
public
hearings
court
action
appeals
advance
determination
of
restitution
and
so
on
the
razing
of
the
moghrabi
district
in
east
jerusalem
happened
within
hours
of
the
end
of
the
hostilities
of
the
day
war
the
residents
were
given
only
two
or
three
hours
notice
to
pack
up
and
find
accomodations
elsewhere
they
had
no
chance
of
public
hearing
debate
appeal
negotiation
or
anything
it
was
get
out
or
die
in
the
rubble
