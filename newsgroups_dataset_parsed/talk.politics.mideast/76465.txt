hamaza
should
take
your
drivel
as

furthermore
you
even
deny
the
obvious
there
was
a
genocide
of
the
muslims
carried
out
by
order
of
the
fascist
xsoviet
armenian
government
massacres
of
muslims
must
be
studied
in
detail
because
they
are
the
first
modern
example
of
the
horrible
crime
of
genocide
blame
must
be
apportioned
to
the
armenians
and
their
supporters
for
the
murder
of
muslims
the
turkish
historic
homeland
emptied
of
its
native
population
until
today
remains
occupied
by
the
xsoviet
armenian
government
today
xsoviet
armenia
covers
up
the
genocide
perpetrated
by
its
predecessors
and
is
therefore
an
accessory
to
this
crime
against
humanity
xsoviet
armenia
must
pay
for
its
crime
of
genocide
against
the
muslims
by
admitting
to
the
crime
and
making
reparations
to
the
turks
and
kurds
