ILYESS
SEZ
SO
HOW
WOULD
HAVE
YOU
DEFENDED
SAUDI
ARABIA
AND
ROLLED
BACK
THE
IRAQI
INVASION
WERE
YOU
IN
CHARGE
OF
SAUDI
ARABIA
ALL
MUSLIMS
KNEW
THAT
THE
WHOLE
THING
WAS
SET
UP
TO
DESTROY
IRAQ
NOT
TO
LIBERATE
KUWAIT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
KILLED
BY
THE
INVASION
ARE
MORE
MANY
MANY
MORE
THAN
THE
ONES
THAT
WERE
KILLED
BY
THE
IRAQIS
IN
THEIR
SMALLER
INVASION
I
LIVED
IN
THE
WEST
AND
I
HAVE
SEEN
HOW
YOUR
MEDIA
PREPARED
YOU
HELPLESS
NAIVE
AMERICANS
FOR
A
WAR
AGAINST
NO
DOUBT
YOU
PLAN
ON
EXPLOITING
HELPLESS
NAIVE
AMERICANS
FOR
YOUR
OWN
PURPOSES
HMMLETS
SEE
IRAQ
EVEN
BEFORE
THE
ARTIFICIAL
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
IRAQ
AND
KUWAIT
THAT
LED
TO
THE
INVASION
AS
THE
CIA
CORRECTLY
PREDICTED
AND
PRETENDED
TO
BE
SURPRISED
NOT
TO
KNOW
IT
JUST
HAPPENED
THAT
SADDAM
WAS
SO
PREDICTIBLE
AND
SO
ARROGANT
AND
STUPID
WHAT
WOULD
I
HAVE
DONE
MOST
MUSLIMS
WOULD
CHOOSE
DEAD
KUWAITIS
OVER
DEAD
IRAQIS
AND
DEAD
KUWAITIS
THE
FIRST
CASE
WOULD
HAPPEN
IF
NO
WESTERN
INTERVENTION
HAPPENED
AND
THE
SECOND
CASE
WAS
A
DIRECT
OR
INDIRECT
RESULT
OF
WESTERN
ENVOLVEMENT
POSSIBLY
IF
IRAQIS
HAD
INDEED
DIED
BUT
THIS
NUMBER
IS
BASED
ON
GREENPEACE
ESTIMATES
GREENPEACE
HAD
COMPROMISED
ITS
ALLEGED
IMPARTIALITY
DURING
THE
WAR
BY
CONDEMNING
THE
POTENTIAL
ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSEQUENCES
OF
ALLIED
MIILTARY
ACTION
WHILE
INITIALLY
COMPLETELY
IGNORING
IRAQS
HORRIBLE
ENVIRONMENTAL
CRIMES
STARTING
WITH
THE
DUMPING
OF
MILLIONS
OF
BARRELS
OF
OIL
INTO
THE
GULF
AT
AHMADI
TO
THE
BLOWING
OF
OVER
OIL
WELLS
WHAT
IS
THE
REAL
NUMBER
THERE
HAS
BEEN
A
LOT
OF
WORK
ON
THIS
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
YEARS
NONE
OF
IT
REPORTED
AS
THE
GREENPEACE
FIGURE
SEEMS
TO
GET
CONTINUOUSLY
BANDIED
ABOUT
THE
REAL
NUMBER
SEEMS
TO
BE
AROUND
ON
THE
SAME
ORDER
AS
THE
NUMBER
OF
KUWAITIS
KILLED
TORTURED
AND
KIDNAPPED
DURING
THE
OCCUPATION
IVE
INCLUDED
AN
ARTICLE
I
RECENTLY
POSTED
BELOW
BUT
THIS
IS
REALLY
OLD
NEWS
INDEPENDENT
TELEVISION
NEWS
REPORTED
A
FIGURE
AROUND
ONLY
A
FEW
MONTHS
AFTER
THE
WAR
BUT
IT
WAS
HARDLY
REPORTED
FOR
THE
ALLIES
TO
HAVE
KILLED
IRAQIS
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
TO
KILL
TWICE
THE
TOTAL
NUMBER
OF
IRAQIS
IN
KUWAIT
THE
FAVORED
IMAGE
OF
THE
HYSTERICS
IS
THE
LAST
BATTLE
OF
THE
WAR
AT
MUTLA
THIS
WAS
YET
ANOTHER
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
AMERICAN
AND
EUROPEAN
MEDIA
PLAYING
INTO
THE
HANDS
OF
IRAQ
AND
ITS
DE
FACTO
ALLIES
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
THE
IRAQI
CONVOY
AT
MUTLA
WAS
PORTRAYED
AS
AN
ALLOUT
SLAUGHTER
THIS
IS
SIMPLY
NOT
TRUE
THE
HEAD
AND
TAIL
OF
THE
CONVOY
WAS
BOMBED
INITIALLY
RESULTING
IN
A
LOT
OF
CASUALTIES
AT
THESE
POINTS
BEFORE
BOMBERS
CAME
BACK
MOST
OF
THE
REST

SOLDIERS
FLED
ON

FURTHERMORE
YOUR
ESTIMATES
OF
KUWAITI
WAR
DEAD
IF
ALLIES
HADNT
INVADED
IS
COMPLETELY
RIDICULOUS
YOU
HAVE
ACKNOWLEDGED
CERTAINLY
IMPLICITLY
THAT
SADDAM
IS
A
BARBAROUS
BRUTE
YOU
HAVE
ACKNOWLEDGED
THE
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
HE
HAS
BEEN
RESPONIBLE
FOR
KILLING
IN
HIS
OWN
COUNTRY
YOU
KNOW
THAT
THE
MAN
HE
APPOINTED
AS

ALI

WAS

HENCHMAN

OFF

LAST

HEIDENRICH

ESTIMATED
THE
TOTAL
DEATH

FROM
BOTH
THE

OFFENSIVES
AS

THE

ON

OF

NOTED
THAT
ONLY
ABOUT
OF

OF

WERE
WOUNDED
BASED
ON
THE
CALCULATION
THAT
ABOUT
HALF
AS
MANY
WOUNDED
ESCAPED

WERE

HE
PUT
THE
NUMBER
OF
WOUNDED
AT
ABOUT
USING
A
CONSERVATIVE
RATIO
OF
ONE
DEAD
TO
TWO
WOUNDED
APPLICABLE
TO
THIRD

HE
SET

AT

THE

ARE

LOW
HE
WROTE
MAYBE
THE

ON

WAS

OR
EVEN
EVEN
THEN
THE
EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS
A
DEATH
TOLL
OF
WELL
BELOW
OR
EVEN
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
HE
SAID
THE
FIGURE
WAS
OBVIOUSLY
OFF
BASE
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
MEAN
THAT
VIRTUALLY
ALL
THE
IRAQI
SOLDIERS
IN
THE
KUWAIT
THEATER
OF
OPERATIONS
WERE
CASUALTIES
HE
SAID
TODAYS
BLOODIEST

WERE
NOT
THOSE
FOUGHT
WITH

RATHER
THE

AS
