re
saudi
clergy
and
their
western
supporters
vs
human
rights
ilyess
sez
so
how
would
have
you
defended
saudi
arabia
and
rolled
back
the
iraqi
invasion
were
you
in
charge
of
saudi
arabia
all
muslims
knew
that
the
whole
thing
was
set
up
to
destroy
iraq
not
to
liberate
kuwait
the
people
who
were
killed
by
the
invasion
are
more
many
many
more
than
the
ones
that
were
killed
by
the
iraqis
in
their
smaller
invasion
i
lived
in
the
west
and
i
have
seen
how
your
media
prepared
you
helpless
naive
americans
for
a
war
against
no
doubt
you
plan
on
exploiting
helpless
naive
americans
for
your
own
purposes
hmmlets
see
iraq
even
before
the
artificial
conflict
between
iraq
and
kuwait
that
led
to
the
invasion
as
the
cia
correctly
predicted
and
pretended
to
be
surprised
not
to
know
it
just
happened
that
saddam
was
so
predictible
and
so
arrogant
and
stupid
what
would
i
have
done
most
muslims
would
choose
dead
kuwaitis
over
dead
iraqis
and
dead
kuwaitis
the
first
case
would
happen
if
no
western
intervention
happened
and
the
second
case
was
a
direct
or
indirect
result
of
western
envolvement
possibly
if
iraqis
had
indeed
died
but
this
number
is
based
on
greenpeace
estimates
greenpeace
had
compromised
its
alleged
impartiality
during
the
war
by
condemning
the
potential
environmental
consequences
of
allied
miiltary
action
while
initially
completely
ignoring
iraqs
horrible
environmental
crimes
starting
with
the
dumping
of
millions
of
barrels
of
oil
into
the
gulf
at
ahmadi
to
the
blowing
of
over
oil
wells
what
is
the
real
number
there
has
been
a
lot
of
work
on
this
in
the
last
two
years
none
of
it
reported
as
the
greenpeace
figure
seems
to
get
continuously
bandied
about
the
real
number
seems
to
be
around
on
the
same
order
as
the
number
of
kuwaitis
killed
tortured
and
kidnapped
during
the
occupation
ive
included
an
article
i
recently
posted
below
but
this
is
really
old
news
independent
television
news
reported
a
figure
around
only
a
few
months
after
the
war
but
it
was
hardly
reported
for
the
allies
to
have
killed
iraqis
they
would
have
had
to
kill
twice
the
total
number
of
iraqis
in
kuwait
the
favored
image
of
the
hysterics
is
the
last
battle
of
the
war
at
mutla
this
was
yet
another
example
of
the
american
and
european
media
playing
into
the
hands
of
iraq
and
its
de
facto
allies
the
destruction
of
the
iraqi
convoy
at
mutla
was
portrayed
as
an
allout
slaughter
this
is
simply
not
true
the
head
and
tail
of
the
convoy
was
bombed
initially
resulting
in
a
lot
of
casualties
at
these
points
before
bombers
came
back
most
of
the
rest
of
the
iraqi
soldiers
fled
on
foot
furthermore
your
estimates
of
kuwaiti
war
dead
if
allies
hadnt
invaded
is
completely
ridiculous
you
have
acknowledged
certainly
implicitly
that
saddam
is
a
barbarous
brute
you
have
acknowledged
the
hundreds
of
thousands
he
has
been
responible
for
killing
in
his
own
country
you
know
that
the
man
he
appointed
as
governor
of
kuwait
ali
majid
was
his
most
brutal
henchman
presiding
over
the
near
genocide
of
the
kurds
in
the
late
and
more
recently
the
shia
yet
when
it
comes
to
his
treatment
of
kuwaitis
he
is
an
angel
in
your
estimate
he
wouldve
killed
fewer
than
he
already
had
when
the
war
started

a

after

war
ended
the
world
was
told
that
as
many
as
iraqi
soldiers
were
killed
at
one
point
even
baghdad
put
the
toll
that
high
as
did
the
us
defense

agency
in

but
us
officials
have
been
backpedaling
ever
since
even
though
the
pentagon
has
yet
to
settle
on
an
official
estimate
to
release
to
the
public
now
one
former
dia
analyst
says
the
number
of
iraqi
troops
killed
may
have
been
as
low
as
that
conclusion
by
john
heidenrich
writing
in
the
current
issue
of
the
quarterly
magazine
foreign
policy
represents
the
lowest
estimate
yet
from
us
defense
sources
the
revisions
suggesting
a
less
devastating
iraqi
toll
fit
a
pattern
of
vastly
moderated
us
military
claims
in
the
months
after
the
war
ended
claims
for
a
number
of
us
weapons
also
were
scaled
down
despite
the
dramatic
videotapes
of
successful
weaponry
or
the
shocking
pictures
of
iraqs
disastrous
retreat
from
kuwait
arguments
have
continued
unabated
about
what
really
happened
in
the
gulf
war
heidenrich
is
not
the
first
to
question
the
iraqi
death
toll
numbers
that
originally
were
aired
more
that
a
year
ago
air
force
lt
gen
charles
horner
the
commander
of
the
air
campaign
in
the
gulf
war
said
he
believed
the
iraqi
military
death
toll
was
fewer
than
for
the
entire
war
the
pentagon
itself
still
refuses
to
provide
an
estimate
of
the
number
of
iraqis
who
died
in
the

against
the

in

and

on
monday
pentagon
spokesman
lt
cmdr
joe
gradisher
reiterated
past
statements
that
there
just
isnt
a
number
that
is
credible
but
some
current
internal
estimates
range
from
to
iraqi
troops
killed
said
one
analyst
speaking
on
condition
of
anonymity
who
is
familiar
with
the
pentagons
reports
allied
deaths
were
put
at
americans
by
friendly
fire
british
by
american
fire
frenchmen
italian
and
among
various
arab
allies
of
the
postwar
reassessments
the
most
widely
publicized
was
the
armys
reluctant
acknowledgement
months
later
that
its
touted
patriot
air
defense
system
was
nowhere
near
so
effective
as
claimed
against
iraqs
scud
missiles
the
bush
administration
initially
claimed
an
almost
perfect
record
for
the
patriot
last
spring
it
revised
the
hit
ratio
to
percent
the
success
record
of
the
navys
tomahawk
hightech
cruise
missile
used
against
targets
in
baghdad
and
other
parts
of
iraq
also
turned
out
to
be
more
modest
than
initially
indicated
by
the
pentagon
the
first
iraqi
casualty
figures
to
surface
after
the
war
came
in
a
may
report
by
the
environmental
group
greenpeace
which
said
to
iraqi
soldiers
were
killed
it
estimated
that
to
iraqi
civilians
were
also
killed
the
same
month
published
reports
said
the
defense
intelligence
agency
estimated
iraqi
soldiers
were
killed
and
wounded
in
the
air
and
ground
campaigns
although
the
agency
qualified
that
by
saying
the
estimate
could
be
off
by
as
much
as
percent
in
either
direction
but
as
more
information
became
available
those
figures
gradually
were
revised
downward
the
house
armed
services
committee
staff
estimated
dead
and
wounded
after
a
review
last
year
but
heidenrich
writing
in
the
current
issue
of
the
quarterly
foreign
policy
estimated
the
total
death
toll
from
both
the
air
and
ground
offensives
as
low
as
with
about
wounded
heidenrich
based
the
conclusion
in
his
article
on
the
number
of
bodies
found
and
buried
by
us
troops
and
on
prisoner
of
war
interviews
he
noted
that
only
about
of
iraqi
prisoners
of
war
were
wounded
based
on
the
calculation
that
about
half
as
many
wounded
escaped
as
were
captured
he
put
the
number
of
wounded
at
about
using
a
conservative
ratio
of
one
dead
to
two
wounded
applicable
to
third
world
armies
like
iraq
he
set
battlefield
deaths
at
maybe
the
figures
are
too
low
he
wrote
maybe
the
real
death
toll
on
the
battlefield
was
or
or
even
even
then
the
evidence
suggests
a
death
toll
of
well
below
or
even
in
an
interview
he
said
the
figure
was
obviously
off
base
because
it
would
mean
that
virtually
all
the
iraqi
soldiers
in
the
kuwait
theater
of
operations
were
casualties
he
said
todays
bloodiest
wars
were
not
those
fought
with
high
technology
but
rather
the
drawnout
conflicts
such
as
those
in
yugoslavia
and
somalia
