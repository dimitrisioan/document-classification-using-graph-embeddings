OH
YEAH
ISRAEL
WAS
REALLY
READY
TO
EXPAND
ITS
BORDERS
ON
THE
HOLIEST
DAY
SB
OF
THE
YEAR
YOM
KIPPUR
WHEN
THE
ARABS
ATTACKED
IN
OH
WAIT
YOU
SB
CHOSE
TO
OMIT
THAT
WARPERHAPS
BECAUSE
IT
SUPPORTS
THE
EXACT
SB
OPPOSITE
TO
THE
POINT
YOU
ARE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
ITS
SB
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
THE
WAR
THAT
HIT
ISRAEL
THE
HARDEST
ALSO
IN
IT
WAS
SB
EGYPT
NOT
ISRAEL
WHO
KICKED
OUT
THE
UN
FORCE
IN
IT
WAS
THE
ARABS
SB
WHO
REFUSED
TO
ACCEPT
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
ISRAEL
BASED
ON
THE
BORDERS
SET
SB
BY
THE
UNITED
NATIONS
IN
EGYPT
CLOSED
OFF
THE
RED
SEA
TO
ISRAELI
SB
SHIPPING
A
CLEAR
ANTAGONISTIC
ACT
AND
IN
THE
ATTACK
WAS
A
RESPONSE
SB
TO
YEARS
OF
CONSTANT
SHELLING
BY
TERRORIST
ORGANIZATIONS
FROM
THE
GOLAN
SB
HEIGHTS
CHILDREN
WERE
BEING
MURDERED
ALL
THE
TIME
BY
TERRORISTS
AND
ISRAEL
SB
FINALLY
RETALIATED
NOWHERE
DO
I
SEE
A
WAR
THAT
ISRAEL
STARTED
SO
THAT
SB
THE
BORDERS
COULD
BE
EXPANDED
I
AGREE
WITH
ALL
YOU
WRITE
EXCEPT
THAT
TERRORIST
ORGS
WERE
NOT
SHELLING
ISRAEL
FROM
THE
GOLAN
HEIGHTS
IN
BUT
RATHER
FROM
LEBANON
THE
GOLAN
HEIGHTS
HAVE
BEEN
HELD
BY
ISRAEL
SINCE
AND
THEREFORE
THE
PLO
COULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SHELLING
ISRAEL
FROM
THERE
UNLESS
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
