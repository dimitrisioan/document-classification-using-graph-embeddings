WRITES
DEAR
MR
BEYER
IT
IS
NEVER
WISE
TO
CONFUSE
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
WITH
FREEDOM
OF
RACISM
AND
VIOLENT
DERAGATORY
IT
IS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
MANY
FAIL
TO
UNDERSTAND
THIS
CRUCIAL
DISTINCTION
IN
FACT
IF
A
SPEACH
WAS
NOT
OFFENSIVE
TO
SOME
ITS
PROTECTION
UNDER
FREEDOM
OF
SPEACH
LAWS
WOULD
BE
USELESS
IT
IS
SPEACH
THAT
SOME
FIND
QUESTIONABLE
THAT
MUST
BE
PROTECTED
BE
IT
RELIGIOUSLY
BLASPHEMOUS
OR
INHERENTLY
RACIST
IT
IS
ONLY
THROUGH
CIVILIZED
DISCOURSE
AND
NOT
SCARE
TACTICS
THAT
ONE
CAN
ENLIGHTEN
THOSE
THAT
ONE
PERCEIVES
TO
BE
IGNORANT
THAT
IS
THE
IDEA
BEHIND
FREEDOM
OF
EXPRESSION
WHAT
YOU
FIND
OFFENSIVE
MIGHT
BE
PERCEIVED
AS
TRUTH
BY
SOME
AND
WHAT
THEY
MIGHT
FIND
OFFENSIVE
MIGHT
BE
YOUR
BELIEF
IT
IS
ONLY
THROUGH
FREE
EXCHANGE
OF
IDEAS
AND
INSULTS
AS
THE
CASE
SEEMS
TO
BE
WITH
THIS
CHANNEL
THAT
ONE
CAN
CHANGE
ANOTHERS
ERRING
WAYSTHAT
IS
WHY
JEFFERSON
SAID
THAT
HERE
WE
ARE
NOT
AFRAID
TO
TOLERATE
ERROR
SO
LONG
AS
REASON
IS
LEFT
TO
COMBAT
IT
THOSE
WHO
FORWARD
OFFENSIVE
POSTS
TO
THE
SYSADMIN
ARENT
CURTAILING
ANYONES
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
THE
NEONAZI
MOVEMENT
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
MAKE
SPEECHES
SAY
ANYTHING
THEY
WANT
THEY
DO
NOT
HAVE
A
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
THESE
SPEECHES
PUBLISHED
BY
THE
NY
TIMES
THAT
DEPENDS
ON
THE
TIMES
ANALYSIS
OF
THE
ECONOMIC
AND
TO
SOMEWHAT
EXTENT
NEWSWORTHY
VALUE
OF
THOSE
SPEECHES
LIKEWISE
TO
THE
SYSADMIN
OF
THIS
FELLOWS
SYSTEM
IF
HE
FEELS
HIS
RESOURCES
ARE
BEING
USED
IN
A
MANNER
THAT
IS
NOT
IN
HIS
BEST
INTERESTS
OR
ARE
PERHAPS
EMBARASSING
TO
HIS
ORGANIZATION
HE
WILL
ACT
JUST
AS
THE
NEW
YORK
TIMES
DOES
NOT
TO
BE
A
CONDUIT
FOR
THESE
IDEAS
THE
POSTER
IS
AFTER
ALL
FREELOADING
OFF
OF
SOMEONE
ELSES
POCKET
BOOK
WHEN
HE
POSTS
HE
WHO
CONTROLS
THE
PURSE
STRINGS
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
MAKE
THE
DECISION
HOW
HE
WANTS
THOSE
FUNDS
SPENT
OR
NOT
SPENT
NOONE
IS
GOING
TO
PUT
THE
POSTER
IN
JAIL
UNLESS
HE
BOMBS
A
LOCAL
BUILDING
AS
A
SYMBOL
OF
HIS
HATRED
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
IN
NO
WAY
EQUATES
TO
ACCESSIBILITY
TO
CONDUITS
OF
INFORMATION
THE
MARKET
OF
IDEAS
HAS
ITS
OWN
NATURAL
SELECTION
PROCESS
THAT
WEEDS
OUT
THE
GAGA
FROM
THE
CREDIBLE
IDEAS
THAT
