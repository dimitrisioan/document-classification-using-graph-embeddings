are
we
sure
we
want
to
invoke
the

i
dunno
warren
just
the
other
day
i
heard
a
rumor
that
serdar
argic
aka
hasan
mutlu
and
ahmed
cosar
and
zumabot
is
not
really
a
turk
at
all
but
in
fact
is
an
armenian
who
is
attempting
to
make
any
discussion
of
the
massacres
in
armenia
of
turks
so
noiseladen
as
to
make
serious
discussion
impossible
thereby
cloaking
the
historical
record
with
a
tremendous
cloud
of
confusion
dis
it
possible
to
track
down
zuma
and
determine
whowhatwhere
seradr
is
if
not
why
not
i
assume
hisherits
identity

not
shielded

similar
to
those
in
