let
me
translate
for
everyone
else
before
the
public
traslation
service
gets
into
it
armenia
is
getting
itchy
esin
let
me
clearify
mr
turkish
armenia
is
not
getting
itchy
she
is
simply
letting
the
world
know
that
she
will
no
longer
sit
there
quiet
and
let
turks
get
away
with
their
famous
tricks
armenians
do
remember
of
the
turkish
invasion
of
the
greek
island
of
cypress
while
the
world
simply
watched
your
ignorance
is
obvious
from
your
posting
cyprus
was
an
independent
country
with
turkishgreek
inhabitants
not
a
greek
island
like
your
ignorant
posting
claims
the
name
should
be
cyprus
in
english
next
time
read
and
learn
before
you
post
