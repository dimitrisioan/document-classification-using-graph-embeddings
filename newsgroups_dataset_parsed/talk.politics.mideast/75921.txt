ASSUMING
ALSO
COME
ON
BRAD
IF
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
GET
ANYWHERE
IN
THIS
OR
ANY
DISCUSSION
IT
DOESNT
HELP
TO
BRING
UP
ELEMENTS
I
NEVER
ADDRESSED
NOR
COMMENTED
ON
IN
ANY
WAY
I
MADE
NO
COMMENT
ON
WHO
IS
RIGHT
OR
WHO
IS
WRONG
ONLY
THAT
CIVILIANS
ARE
BEING
USED
AS
COVER
AND
THAT
HAVING
BEEN
PLACED
IN
BETWEEN
THE
ISRAELIS
AND
THE
GUERILLAS
THEY
WILL
BE
INJURED
AS
BOTH
PARTIES
CONTINUE
THEIR
FIGHT
PARDON
ME
TIM
BUT
I
DO
NOT
SEE
HOW
IT
CAN
BE
POSSIBLE
FOR
THE
IDF
TO
FAIL
TO
DETECT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THOSE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
PLANTING
THE
BOMB
WHICH
KILLED
THE
THREE
IDF
TROOPS
AND
THEN
LATER
KNOW
THE
EXACT
NUMBER
AND
WHEREABOUTS
OF
ALL
OF
THEM
SEVERAL
VILLAGES
WERE
SHELLED
HOW
COULD
THE
IDF
POSSIBLY
HAVE
KNOWN
THAT
THERE
WERE
GUERRILLAS
IN
EACH
OF
THE
TARGETTED
VILLAGES
YOU
SEE
IT
WAS
AN
ARBITRARY
ACT
OF
RETALIATION
I
WILL
AGAIN
REPEAT
MY
STATEMENT
I
DO
NOT
CONDONE
THESE
INDISCRIMINATE
ISRAELI
ACTS
NOR
HAVE
I
EVER
IF
THE
VILLAGERS
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHO
THESE
GUERILLAS
ARE
WHICH
YOU
STATED
EARLIER
HOW
DO
YOU
EXPECT
THE
ISRAELIS
TO
KNOW
IT
IS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
IDENTIFY
WHO
THEY
ARE
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
GUERILLAS
PREFER
TO
LOSE
THEMSELVES
IN
THE
GENERAL
POPULATION
BY
DRESSING
THE
SAME
ACTING
THE
SAME
ETC
THE
HOST
ARAB
STATE
DID
LITTLENOTHING
TO
TRY
AND
STOP
THESE
ATTACKS
FROM
ITS
SIDE
OF
THE
BORDER
WITH
ISRAEL
THE
PROBLEM
TIM
IS
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
REASON
FOR
THE
INVASION
WAS
PALESTINIAN
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
NOT
LEBANESE
ATTACKS
I
AGREE
BUT
BECAUSE
LEBANON
WAS
EITHER
UNWILLING
OR
UNABLE
TO
STOP
THESE
ATTACKS
FROM
ITS
TERRITORY
SHOULD
ISRAEL
SIMPLY
SIT
QUIETLY
AND
ACCEPT
ITS
SITUATION
ISRAEL
ASKED
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
OVER
AND
OVER
TO
CONTROL
THIS
THIRD
PARTY
STATE
WITHIN
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
AND
THE
ATTACKS
KEPT
OCCURING
AT
WHAT
POINT
DOES
ISRAEL
OR
ANY
STATE
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
DO
SOMETHING
ITSELF
TO
STOP
SUCH
ATTACKS
NEVER
WHILE
THE
MAJOR
ARMAMENTS
THOSE
ALLOWING
PEOPLE
TO
WAGE
CIVIL
WARS
HAVE
BEEN
REMOVED
THE
WEAPONS
NEEDED
TO
CROSSBORDER
ATTACKS
STILL
REMAIN
TO
SOME
EXTENT
ROCKET
ATTACKS
STILL
CONTINUE
AND
COMMANDO
RAIDS
ONLY
REQUIRE
A
FEW
EASILY
CONCEALED
WEAPONS
AND
A
REFINED
DISREGARD
FOR
HUMAN
LIFE
YOURS
OF
THAT
OF
OTHERS
SUCH
ATTACKS
ALSO
CONTINUE
YES
I
AM
AFRAID
THAT
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
TRUE
BUT
THAT
STILL
DOES
NOT
JUSTIFY
OCCUPYING
YOUR
NEIGHBORS
LAND
ISRAEL
MUST
RESOLVE
ITS
DISPUTES
WITH
THE
NATIVE
PALESTINIANS
IF
IT
WANTS
PEACE
FROM
SUCH
ATTACKS
IT
IS
ALSO
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
OF
ANY
STATE
TO
NOT
ALLOW
ANY
OUTSIDE
PARTY
TO
USE
ITS
TERRITORY
FOR
ATTACKS
ON
A
NEIGHBORING
STATE
IF
ANGOLA
HAD
THE
POWER
AND
SOUTH
AFRICA
REFUSED
OR
COULDNT
STOP
ANTIANGOLAN
GUERILLAS
BASED
ON
SA
SOIL
FROM
ATTACKING
ANGOLA
AND
SOUTH
AFRICA
REFUSED
TO
HAVE
UN
TROOPS
STATIONED
ON
ITS
TERRITORY
BETWEEN
IT
AND
ANGOLA
WOULD
ANGOLA
BE
JUSTIFIED
IN
ENTERING
SA
IF
NOT
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
ANGOLA
HAD
TO
ACCEPT
THE
SITUATION
DO
NOTHING
AND
ABSORB
THE
ATTACKS
BAT
GUANO
THE
SITUATION
YOU
CALL
FOR
EXISTED
IN
THE
AND
ATTACKS
WERE
COMMONPLACE
NOT
TRUE
LEBANESE
WERE
NOT
ATTACKING
ISRAEL
IN
THE
WITH
A
STRONG
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
FREE
FROM
SYRIAN
AND
ISRAELI
INTERFERENCE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BORDER
COULD
BE
ADEQUATELY
PATROLLED
THE
PALESTINIAN
HEAVY
WEAPONS
HAVE
BEEN
SIEZED
IN
PAST
YEARS
AND
I
DO
NOT
SEE
AS
SIGNIFICANT
A
THREAT
AS
ONCE
EXISTED
I
REFERED
ABOVE
AT
ALL
TIMES
TO
THE
PALESTINIAN
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
LEBANESE
SOIL
NOT
TO
LEBANESE
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
ONE
HOPES
THAT
A
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
WILL
BE
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
PATROL
ITS
BORDER
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
IT
WILL
BE
ANY
STRONGER
WHAT
HAS
CHANGED
IS
THAT
THE
PLO
WAS
LARGELY
DRIVEN
OUT
OF
LEBANON
NOT
BY
THE
LEBANESE
NOT
BY
SYRIA
AND
THAT
IS
BY
FAR
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
MAKING
IT
EASIER
TO
CONTROL
FUTURE
PALESTINIAN
ATTACKS
FROM
LEBANESE
SOIL
THAT
CHANGE
WAS
BROUGHT
ABOUT
BY
ISRAELI
ACTION
THE
PLO
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
BEEN
EJECTED
BY
LEBANESE
ARAB
STATE
OR
UN
ACTIONS
PLEASE
TIM
DONT
FALL
INTO
THE
TRAP
OF
TREATING
LEBANESE
AND
PALESTINIANS
AS
ALL
PART
OF
THE
SAME
GROUP
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
WHO
THINK
ALL
ARABS
OR
ALL
MUSLIMS
ARE
THE
SAME
TOO
MANY
TIMES
I
HAVE
SEEN
PEOPLE
SUPPORT
THE
BOMBING
OF
PALESTINIAN
CAMPS
IN
RETALIATION
FOR
AN
IDF
DEATH
AT
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
OR
THE
SHELLING
OF
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
IN
RETALIATION
FOR
A
PALESTINIAN
ATTACK
I
FULLY
RECOGNIZE
THAT
THE
LEBANESE
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
BE
USED
BY
EITHER
SIDE
AND
HAVE
BEEN
AND
CONTINUE
TO
BE
BUT
THE
MOST
FUNDAMENTAL
ISSUE
IS
THAT
IF
A
STATE
CANNOT
CONTROL
ITS
BORDERS
AND
MAKE
REAL
EFFORTS
TO
DO
SO
IT
SHOULD
EXPECT
OTHERS
TO
DO
IT
FOR
THEM
HOPEFULLY
THAT
OTHER
WILL
BE
THE
UN
BUT
IT
IS
AS
WE
SEE
IN
ITS
COWARDICE
REGARDING
BOSNIA
WEAK
TIM
