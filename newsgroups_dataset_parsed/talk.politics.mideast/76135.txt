that
they
were

they
were
correct
the
first
time
zionism
is
racism
and
thankfully
the
mcgill
daily
the
student
newspaper
at
mcgill
was
proud
enough
to
print
an
article
saying
so
if
you
want
a
copy
send
me
mail
was
the
article
about
zionism
or
about
something
else
the
majority
of
people
i
heard
emitting
this
ignorant
statement
do
not
really
know
what
zionism
is
they
have
just
associated
it
with
what
they
think
they
know
about
the
political
situation
in
the
middle
east
so
steve

here
what
is
zionism
assuming
that
you
mean
hear
you
werent
listening
he
just
told
you
zionism
is

a
tautological
