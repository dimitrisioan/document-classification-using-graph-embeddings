one
of
my
biggest
complaints
about
using
the
word
fundamentalist
is
that
at
least
in
the
usa
people
speak
of
muslime
fundamentalists
muslim
but
nobody
defines
what
a
jewish
or
christan
fundamentalist
is
i
wonder
what
an
equal
definition
would
be
any
takers
well
i
would
go
as
far
as
saying
that
naturei
karta
are
definitely
jewish
fundamentalists
other
ultraorthodox
jewish
groups
might
very
well
be
though
i
am
hesitant
of
making
such
a
broad
generalization
