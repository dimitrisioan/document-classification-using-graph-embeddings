re
freedom
in
usa
in
a
previous
article
john
a
absood
says
it
is
never
wise
to
confuse
freedom
of
speech
with
freedom
of
racism
and
violent
deragatory
it
is
unfortunate
that
many
fail
to
understand
this
crucial
distinction
i
couldnt
agree
more
canada
has
an
antihate
law
which
exists
to
punish
those
who
wilfully
spread
false
propaganda
lies
for
the
purpose
of
putting
down
another
group
this
is
actually
the
law
that
david
irving
will
hopefully
be
found
guilty
under
due
to
his
denial
of
the
holocaust
its
too
bad
that
this
useless
centre
for
policy
research
isnt
in
canada
itd
set
a
nice
precedent
to
how
the
law
applies
in
cyberspace
