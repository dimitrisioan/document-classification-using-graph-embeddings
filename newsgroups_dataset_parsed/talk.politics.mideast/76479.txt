THE
BEDROOM
WINDOWTHE
ZNANIYE
BOOKSTORE
IS
DOWN
THERE
AND
ARMENIANS
LIVE
ON
THE
SECOND
AND
FOURTH
FLOORSI
SAW
THEIR
THINGS
BEING
THROWN
OUT
THE
WINDOWS
I
REALIZED
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BE
UPON
US
ANY
MINUTE
I
SHOUTED
TO
GAYANE
GAYA
HIDE
THE
GOLD
THATS
HONESTLY
WHAT
I
TOLD
MY
CHILD
I
GRABBED
DIANA
I
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
VIKA
STILL
WASNT
HOME
AND
IT
WAS
ALREADY
GETTING
DARK
I
WAS
AFRAID
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
TIME
BECAUSE
I
WAS
ALREADY
HORRIFIED
AS
IT
WAS
GAYANE
JUST
IN
CASE
WE
CHANGED
THE
TELEVISION
CHANNEL
FROM
THE
MOSCOW
STATION
TO
THE
AZERBAIJANI
ONE
ZINAIDA
AND
TURNED
IT
UP
LOUD
GAYANE
WE
NEVER
LISTENED
TO
AZERBAIJANI
MUSIC
IT
JUST
DIDNT
DO
MUCH
FOR
US
IN
ALL
THOSE
YEARS
WE
ALMOST
NEVER
LISTENED
TO
IT
BUT
SOMETIMES
WE
WOULD
WATCH
SOME
ENTERTAINMENT
SHOW
OR
FILM
ON
AZERBAIJANI
TELEVISION
AND
THAT
WAS
IT
AND
HERE
WE
HAD
IT
TURNED
UP
FULL
BLAST
SO
THEY
WOULD
THINK
WE
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
ZINAIDA
WELL
YOU
CAN
IMAGINE
THEYRE
SLAUGHTERING
ARMENIANS
ROBBING
THEM
AND
WERE
LISTENING
TO
THIS
CONCERT
MUSIC
FROM
BAKU
OUR
AZERBAIJANI
NEIGHBORS
SUGGESTED
WE
DO
IT
THEY
KNOCKED
ON
THE
DOOR
AND
TOLD
GAYA
TO
TURN
ON
AZERBAIJANI
MUSIC
BUT
WE
ALREADY
HAD
IT
ON
ANYWAY
TURN
ON
THE
LIGHTS
THEY
TOLD
US
SO
THEY
WILL
THINK
YOURE
NOT
ARMENIANS
THEYRE
SAYING
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
AFRAID
TO
TURN
ON
THEIR
LIGHTS
THEYRE
HIDING
GAYANE
APPARENTLY
THERE
WAS
SOME
KIND
OF
ARRANGEMENT
BECAUSE
WE
NOTICED
THAT
THE
LIGHTS
WERE
OFF
ONLY
IN
ARMENIAN
APARTMENTS
THAT
IS
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
WERE
WARNED
AND
EVERY
LAST
ONE
OF
THEM
HAD
THEIR
LIGHTS
ON
WHEN
WE
TURNED
THE
LIGHTS
OFF
TWO
OF
OUR
NEIGHBORS
CAME
IMMEDIATELY
AND
LATER
ANOTHER
ONE
TURN
ON
THE
LIGHTS
THEY
TOLD
US
PLEASE
NOTHING
WILL
HAPPEN
BE
CALM
NOTHING
WILL
HAPPEN
ZINAIDA
WE
WONT
ALLOW
THEM
TO
COME
INTO
YOUR
APARTMENT
GAYANE
WE
BELIEVED
THOSE
PEOPLE
WE
HAD
NEVER
DONE
ANYTHING
BAD
TO
THEM
ZINAIDA
AFTER
THE
WHOLE
NIGHTMARE
ABOUT
MARCH
BEFORE
WE
LEFT
FOR
ARMENIA
WHEN
I
WAS
COMING
INTO
THE
BUILDING
THEY
WERE
ALL
CRYING
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
WERE
CRYING
SAYING
CAN
IT
BE
THERE
IS
NO
GOD
HOW
COULD
THEY
RAISE
THEIR
HANDS
AGAINST
YOUR
FAMILY
YOU
NEVER
DID
ANYONE
ANY
HARM
YOU
NEVER
REFUSED
ANYONE
ANYTHING
NOT
IN
HARD
TIMES
OR
IN
TIME
OF
FORTUNE
OR
IN
TIME
OF
MOURNING
HOW
COULD
THEY
GIVE
YOU
AWAY
HOW
COULD
THEY
SELL
YOU
DOWN
THE
RIVER
THEY
REALLY
HAD
GIVEN
US
AWAY
SOME
OF
THEM
PROTECTED
US
BUT
OTHERS
GAVE
US
AWAY
THEY
SOLD
US
DOWN
THE
RIVER
GAYANE
I
WAS
WEARING
SLACKS
THAT
DAY
AND
WHEN
IT
ALL
BEGAN
I
BECAME
CAUTIOUS
FOR
SOME
REASON
AND
I
CHANGED
MY
CLOTHES
AZERBAIJANI
WOMEN
DONT
WEAR
PANTS
YOUNG
ARMENIAN
AND
RUSSIAN
GIRLS
IN
SUMGAIT
WORE
PANTS
BUT
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
FOUND
THAT
VERY
STRANGE
AND
I
THOUGHT
I
BETTER
PUT
ON
A
SKIRT
OTHERWISE
THEY
WONT
BELIEVE
ME
IF
I
TOLD
THEM
WE
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
ELSE
WE
COULD
DO
NO
OTHER
WAY
OUT
I
WAS
FORCED
TO
TURN
MYSELF
INTO
GOD
KNOWS
WHO
I
LET
MY
HAIR
DOWN
TOUSLED
IT
AND
THREW
A
SCARF
OVER
MY
HEAD
ZINAIDA
AND
SHE
TOLD
ME
MAMMA
YOU
HIDE
TAKE
DIANA
AND
GO
INTO
THE
OTHER
ROOM
YOU
TWO
LOOK
MORE
LIKE
ARMENIANS
THEYLL
FIGURE
OUT
THAT
WERE
ARMENIANS
RIGHT
AWAY
BUT
HOW
COULD
I
GO
AWAY
AND
LEAVE
HER
THERE
GAYANE
I
WENT
OUT
ONTO
THE
BALCONY
IT
WORKED
OUT
BETTER
THAT
WAY
WE
WERE
THE
ONLY
ARMENIAN
FAMILY
IN
THE
FOURTH
ENTRYWAY
THIS
GAVE
US
HOPE
WE
WERE
THE
ONLY
ONES
THE
NEIGHBORS
WOULDNT
LET
THEM
IN
THEY
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
WOULD
FEAR
FOR
THEMSELVES
AND
FOR
THEIR
CHILDREN
I
LOOKED
AND
SAW
SOMEONE
CRAWLING
UP
ON
THE
BALCONY
FROM
BELOW
IT
WAS
EASY
TO
GET
UP
ONTO
OUR
BALCONY
WHEN
WE
WOULD
LOSE
THE
KEYS
THE
NEIGHBORS
WOULD
LET
UP
INTO
THEIR
PLACES
AND
WE
WOULD
CRAWL
ACROSS
ONTO
OUR
BALCONY
AND
GET
IN
THAT
WAY
SO
I
TURNED
AROUND
AND
SAW
A
GUY
WITH
A
KNIFE
ON
OUR
BALCONY
HE
LOOKS
AT
ME
AND
SHOUTS
WHAT

BE
ASHAMED
OF

ASKING
A
QUESTION

THAT
EVERYTHING
WAS
SMASHED

OLDS
AND
THEY
DEFENDED
THEMSELVES
IM
A
MOTHER
AFTER
ALL
AND
THEY
WERE
NO
DIFFERENT
FROM
MY
CHILDREN
WHEN
ONE
OF
THE
SOLDIERS
FELL
AND
HIS
HEAD
STARTED
BLEEDING
I
HAD
TO
STOP
LOOKING
L
COULDNT
WATCH
ANYMORE
I
IMAGINED
MY
CHILDREN
IN
THEIR
SHOES
GAYANE
THE
TROOPS
HAD
ASSUMED
THEIR
DEFENSE
THAT
MORNING
AND
HAD
CORDONED
OFF
THE
BUILDINGS
AND
SOME
OF
THE
SOLDIERS
SURROUNDED
THE
BUS
STATION
BLOCK
AND
OUR
MICRODISTRICT
BUT
THEY
ONLY
CORDONED
THEM
OFF
FROM
THE
OUTSIDE
THE
MOB
FELL
UPON
THE
SOLDIERS
WHO
STARTED
TO
PROTECT
THEMSELVES
AND
THE
MOB
SURGED
INTO
THE
COURTYARD
WITH
THE
SOLDIERS
AFTER

ANOTHERS
HEAD
ZINAIDA

WHAT
IT
WAS
LIKE
LIKE
IN
AMERICA

AND
CLUBSTHATS
JUST
HOW
IT
WAS
IN
OUR
COURTYARD
GAYANE
DONT
COMPARE
IT
WITH
AMERICA
THOSE
WERE
PEACEFUL
DEMONSTRATIONS
BUT
THESE
ZINAIDA
BUT
HOW
COULD
IT
HAPPEN
HERE
AND
NOT
OFF
SOMEWHERE
IN
AMERICA
THEY
ATTACKED
THE
SOLDIERS
HURLED
STONES
AT
THEM
THEN
I
THOUGHT
WHERES
THE
TEAR
GAS
THAT
THE
AMERICANS
USE
TO
DISPERSE
DEMONSTRATORS
IF
THEY
HAD
USED
GAS
ON
THOSE
JACKALS
THEY
ALL
WOULD
HAVE
SCATTERED
GAYANE
THEY
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
SCATTERED
THE

THEY
DIDNT
BRING
IN
FRESH

THEY
HADNT
EATEN
THEY
WERE
FINE
STANDING

BUNCHED
INTO
A
GROUP
IN
THE
CENTER
STREET
AND
COVERED
THEMSELVES
WITH
THEIR
SHIELDS
AND
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
SURROUNDED
THEM
AND
THREW
PAVING
STONES
AT
THEM
AND
THOSE
GUYS
SAT
THERE
COVERING
THEMSELVES
WITH
THEIR
SHIELDS
AND
MEANWHILE
TANKS
WITH
MACHINE
GUNS
WERE
CRUISING
THE
STREETS
THEY
ALWAYS
SAY
OUR
CHILDREN
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
WAR
I
NEVER
EVEN
DREAMED
ABOUT
IT
THERE
WAS
NO
NEED
TO
BUT
THEN
I
THOUGHT
ABOUT
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
LIVED
THROUGH
A
WAR
IT
WAS
TRULY
HORRIBLE
THE
GUYS
WERE
TIRED
EXHAUSTED
SOME
HAD
HAD
THEIR
CLUBS
TAKEN
AWAY
OTHERS
THEIR
SHIELDS
THEY
HAD
BEEN
BEATEN
THEY
WERE
COVERED
IN
BLOOD
SO
MANY
DIED
THEY
BEAT
THE
SOLDIERS
WITH
THEIR
OWN
CLUBS
AND
SHIELDS
AND
THOSE
GUYS
STOOD
THERE
AND
COULDNT
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
THEY
COULDNT
OPEN
FIRE
THEY
COULDNT
EVEN
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
LET
ALONE
US
ITS
COMICAL
ZINAIDA
WHAT
ARE

COULD
SOMETHING

THEY
BURNED

SOMEONE
SHOUTED
GET

GOING
TO
BLOW
EVERYONE
SCATTERED
AWAY
AND
THE
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
EXPLODED
THE
SOLDIERS
LOST
THEIR
SENSES
AND
WHEN
THEY
DROVE
THE
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
AND
THE
BUS
AT
THE
MOB
OUT
OF
RAGE
AND
FURY
THEY
DROVE
RIGHT
UP
ON
THE
SIDEWALK
ZINAIDA
THE
BUS
THAT
HAD
BROUGHT
THE
TROOPS
ONLY

OUT
AND
THEY
DRAGGED
THE
VEHICLE
OUT

THE
MIDDLE
OF
THE
ROAD
AND
SET
IT
ON
FIRE
GAYANE

BLINKING
NOT
SAYING
ANYTHING
GAYANE
WHEN
DEMICHEV
ASKED
WHERE
WE
WANTED
TO
GO
EVERYONE
SHOUTED
TO
RUSSIA
TO
BE
HONEST
WE
WERE
ALL
FRIGHTENED
OF
ARMENIA
THERE
WERE
SUCH
WILD
RUMORS
IT
WAS
AS
THOUGH
WE
WERE
IN
A
TERRIBLE
DREAM
AND
NO
ONE
WANTED
TO
GO
TO
ARMENIA
BUT
HE
SAID
THAT
HE
COULDNT
EVACUATE
PEOPLE
TO
RUSSIA
AND
THAT
HE
WOULD
MEET
WITH
EVERYONE
INDIVIDUALLY
THE
NEXT
DAY
AND
SPEAK
WITH
THEM
AND
HE
ALSO
SAID
THAT
TODAY
HE
WAS
GOING
TO
GO
LOOK
AT
ALL
OF
OUR
APARTMENTS
ON
MARCH
WE
WENT
TO
THE
MILITARY
BARRACKS
IN
THE
VILLAGE
OF
NASOSNY
WE
WERE
TAKEN
CARE
OF
MARVELOUSLY
BY
THE
MILITARY
THEY
SENT
SPECIAL
FLIGHTS
OF
CHILDREN
RIGHT
FROM
THERE
TO
MINVODY
YEREVAN
AND
MOSCOW
ONE
WOMAN
LEFT
FOR
MOSCOW
WITH
A
LETTER
FOR
GORBACHEV
AND
GROMYKO
ZINAIDA
THE
WORST
WAS
TRULY
BEHIND
US
BY
THEN
EVERYTHING
HAD
PASSED
BUT
THE
PAIN
WILL
REMAIN
FOR
OUR
WHOLE
LIVES
IT
CANNOT
BE
FORGOTTEN
UNDER
NO
CIRCUMSTANCES
SHOULD
WE
OUR
CHILDREN
OR
OUR
GRANDCHILDREN
FORGET
WHO
WILL
ANSWER
FOR
THOSE
WHO
DIED
FOR
OUR
MOTHERS
SISTERS
BROTHER
SONS
AND
DAUGHTERS
WHO
WILL
BEAR
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
WHO
WILL
WASH
AWAY
THEIR
BLOOD
SOMEONE
SHOULD
BE
MADE
TO
ANSWER
AND
SEVERELY
SO
IT
HAS
AN
EFFECT
ON
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
DID
WITH
US
AS
THEY
PLEASED
IT
ISNT
OVER
YET
NOW
WE
LIVE
HERE
IN
ARMENIA
PROTECTED
BUT
THE
ISSUE
ISNT
RESOLVED
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
STAY
IN
ARMENIA
IN
OUR
HOMELAND
SO
THAT
ALL
THE
ARMENIAN
PEOPLE
WILL
BE
UNITED
THEN
WE
WILL
BE
INVINCIBLE
ARMENIANS
WONT
BE
SCATTERED
THROUGHOUT
THE
SOVIET
UNION
ABOUT
THE
WORLD
AND
IF
WERE
ALL
TOGETHER
THIS
WONT
HAPPEN
AGAIN
AS
A
MOTHER
OF
THREE
CHILDREN
AS
A
WOMAN
AS
A
SISTER
I
ASK
ARMENIANS
TO
BE
UNITED
SO
THAT
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
SUMGAIT
WILL
NEVER
HAPPEN
AGAIN
OUR
HOMELAND
THE
ONLY
REQUEST
WE
HAVE
IS
THAT
WE
BE
HELPED
IN
OBTAINING
AN
APARTMENT
AND
GETTING
JOBS
SO
THAT
OUR
CHILDREN
CAN
WORK
FOR
THE
GOOD
OF
ARMENIA
IF
WE
ARENT
ABLE
TO
THEN
LET
OUR
CHILDREN
DO
IT
AND
IF
ITS
POSSIBLE
WELL
WORK
FOR
THE
GOOD
OF
ARMENIA
TOO
THIS
IS
THE
LAND
OF
OUR
FOREFATHERS
OUR
GRANDFATHERS
AND
GREATGRANDFATHERS
LIVED
HERE
TOO
IT
WAS
ONLY
LATER
THAT
PEOPLE
DISPERSED
ALL
OVER
LIKE
A
MOTHER
THE
LAND
HERE
BORE
AND
REARED
US
IT
IS
OUR
WIFE
AND
WILL
PROTECT
US
TOO
I
WANT
BUT
ONE
THING
THAT
OUR
PEOPLE
NEVER
SEE
THE
HARDSHIP
THAT
OUR
CHILDREN
SAW
THAT
YOUR
CHILDREN
HERE
IN
ARMENIA
NEVER
SEE
ANYTHING
LIKE
