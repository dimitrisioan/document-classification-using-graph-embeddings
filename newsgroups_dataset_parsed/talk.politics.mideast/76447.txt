WRITES
BULL
SHIT
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
IN
THE
WORLD
WHY
WE
CANT
SAY
THAT
TAKING
VIEWS
ANALOGOUS
TO
THE
KKKS
OR
SOME
SUCH
ORGANIZATION
IS
WRONG
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
WHY
SOME
MORALITY
MAY
NOT
BE
LEGISLATED
AS
IT
IS
WE
DO
NOT
ALLOW
THEFT
OR
MURDER
OR
RAPE
WHY
SHOULD
WE
ALLOW
HATEFUL
SPPECH
WHOSE
ONLY
PURPOSE
IS

STIR
ANGER
AND
VIOLENCE
HARRY
I
THINK
THE
ANSWER
TO
MR
MAYAMSKYS
QUESTION
CAN
BE
FOUND
IN
THE
MR
MAMAYSKYS
FIRST
AMENDMENT
TO
THE
US
CONSTITUTION
AMENDMENT
I
CONGRESS
SHALL
MAKE
NO
LAW
RESPECTING
AN
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
RELIGION
OR
PROHIBITING
THE
FREE
EXERCISE
THEREOF
OR
ABRIDGING
THE
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
OR
OF
THE
PRESS
OR
THE
RIGHT
OF
THE
PEOPLE
PEACEABLY
TO
ASSEMBLE
AND
TO
PETITION
THE
GOVERNMENT
FOR
A
REDRESS
OF
GRIEVANCES
STEVE
I
DO
NOT
SAY
THAT
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
SHOULD
BE
BANNED
FAR
FROM
IT
I
AM
MERELY
SUGGESTING
THAT
THERE
ARE
CERTAIN
THINGS
WHICH
CAN
BE
UNIVERSALLY
AGREED
TO
BE
MORALLY
INCORRECT
THERE
ARE
NOT
MANY
SUCH
THINGS
BUT
THERE
ARE
SOME
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
MURDER
IS
MORALLY
INCORRECT
THE
IDEA
THAT
ONE
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
IS
SOMEHOW
RACIALLY
INFERIOR
TO
ANOTHER
IS
MORALLY
INCORRECT
ETC
THE
POINT
IS
THAT
ANY
ACTION
WHICH
SERVES
TO
PROMOTE
A
MORALLY
INCORRECT
ACTION
SHOULD
BE
FORBIDDEN
THIS
IMPLIES
THAT
NO
ONE
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
SAY
THAT
AN
INNOCENT
PERSON
SHOULD
BE
MURDERED
REGARDLESS
OF
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
I
MAY
NOT
STAND
ON
A
STREET
CORNER
AND
ADVOCATE
THE
MURDER
OF
INNOCENT
PEOPLE
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
IS
THAT
MURDER
IS
A
MORALLY
INCORRECT
ACTION
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
SINCE
BIGOTRY
IS
MORALLY
INCORRECT
IN
THE
NARROW
DEFINITION
WHICH
WE
HAVE
GIVEN
IT
I
NOR
ANY
ONE
ELSE
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
STAND
ON
A
STREET
CORNER
AND
PROMOTE
BIGOTRY
SUCH
AN
ENFORCEMENT
DOES
IN
NO
WAY
DENY
ANY
ONE
THEIR
RIGHTS
AS
GUARANTEED
BY
THE
FIRST
AMENDMENT
IT
MERELY
ENSURES
THAT
NO
PERSON
MAY
BE
THE
TARGET
OF
AN
ATTEMPT
TO
DENY
HIM
A
FUNDAMENTAL
MORAL
RIGHT
SUCH
AS
THE
RIGHT
TO
NOT
BE
MURDERED
AND
THE
RIGHT
NOT
TO
BE
DISCRIMINATED
AGAINST
I
BELIEVE
MR
BERSON
THAT
TO
BLINDLY
ACCEPT
THE
CONSTITUTION
IS
A
TERRIFIC
MISTAKE
WE
MUST
CINSTANTLY
QUESTION
THE
CONSTITUTION
AND
INTERPRET
IT
IN
A
WAY
BEFITTING
THE
SOCIETY
IN
WHICH
WE
LIVE
ANYTHING
SHORT
OF
SUCH
AN
EFFORT
WOULD
RENDER
US
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
TRAINED
MONKEYS
WHO
ARE
ABLE
TO
MERELY
REPEAT
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
HEARD
WITHOUT
PAYING
THE
SLIGHTEST
BIT
OF
ATTENTION
TO
THE
INTENT
OF
THE
DOCUMENT
IN
QUESTION
WOULD
YOU
DISAGREE
