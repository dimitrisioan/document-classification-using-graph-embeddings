EVEN
IF
THE

EASY
TO
UNDERSTAND

OTTOMAN
LIFE

WHEN
COMPARED

LIFE

HELD

THERE
IS
NO

WITH

IT
IS
RECORDED
THAT
SOME

THE
REGULARITY

SUGGESTS
THAT
THE

WERE

THAT

A

TRICKLE

FAMILIES
MOVING
SOUTHWARD

EASTWARD

IT
IS

THAT
THE
EFFECTS
OF
PLAGUE
LATE
CRUSADES
AND
THE
GENERAL
INTOLERANCE
AND
PERSECUTION
OF

IN

RESULTED

DESCRIBED

THE
EASE

AN
ATTRACTION

THOSE
WHO
WOULD
MAKE
A
PILGRIMAGE
OR
CHOOSE
TO
BE
BURIED

PAGE
THE
IMPRESSION
GAINED
FROM
THE
HEBREW
SOURCES
IS
THAT
THE
JEWS
WERE
FIRMLY
AWARE
OF
THE
COMMUNITY
OF
INTERESTS
WHICH
EXISTED
BETWEEN
THEM
AND
THE
OTTOMANS
ESPECIALLY
IN
COMPARISON
TO
RELATIONS
WITH
THE
CHRISTIANS
OF
EUROPE
CONFIRMATION
OF
THE
COMMONALITY
OF
INTERESTS
BETWEEN
MUSLIMS
AND
JEWS
IS
ALSO
INDICATED
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
EUROPEAN
CHRISTIANS
PERCEIVED
THE
JEWS
AS
ALLIES
OF

WERE
WELL
AWARE

MUSLIMJEWISH
COOPERATION
CERTAINLY
THE

UNNOTICED
EUROPEAN
SOURCES
ARE
THE
BASIS
FOR
MUCH
OF
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THEIR
CAREERS
IN
ADDITION
IT
APPEARS
THAT
CHRISTIAN
PIRATES
PLUNDERED
TURKS
AND
JEWS
THEIR
SWORN
ENEMIES
AND
THAT
EUROPEANS
CONSIDERED
THE
JEWS
TO
BE
AGENTS
WHO
REGULARLY
REPORTED
TO
THE
OTTOMANS
THERE
ARE
WELLKNOWN
EXAMPLES
OF
OVERT
JEWISH
SUPPORT

STRUGGLE
AGAINST

THE
TWO

INSTANCES

FREQUENTLY

INSTANCES

THE

THE
CONQUESTS

SIXTEENTH

WE
ALSO
HAVE
REPORTS

THE

THE
SIEGE

AN
UNPUBLISHED

SHOWS
DRAMATICALLY
THE
MUTUAL
INTERESTS
WHICH
EXISTED
IN
SOME
GREEK
TOWNS

IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
THROUGHOUT
THE
SIXTEENTH

IT
WAS
A
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
FACT

THE
INTERESTS
OF
JEWS
AND
MUSLIMS
COINCIDED
FREQUENTLY

ALL
PARTIES
INVOLVED
JEWS

CHRISTIANS
WERE
AWARE

THE
SITUATION

IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
RELATIONS
BETWEEN
GREEKS
AND
JEWS
WERE
NOT
PARTICULARLY
CORDIAL
THE
TWO
GROUPS
HAD
LITTLE
IN
COMMON
FEW
COMMON
INTERESTS

PERCEIVED
NO
COMMON
PHILOSOPHICAL
OR
RELIGIOUS
TRADITION
WHICH
COULD
SERVE
AS
THE
BASIS

COOPERATION
RATHER
THAN
ENMITY

WAS
ANY
IDENTIFIABLE
BOND
OF
GOOD
WILL
WHICH
EXISTED
BETWEEN

THE
FIFTEENTH

SIXTEENTH
CENTURIES
IT
WAS
THAT
BETWEEN

THE
GENERAL
IMPRESSION
OF
MUSLIMJEWISH
RELATIONS
IN
THE
OTTOMAN
CONTEXT
DURING
THE
FIFTEENTH
AND
SIXTEENTH
CENTURIES
IS
ONE
OF
COMMUNITY
OF
INTERESTS
FROM
THE
EARLIEST
TIMES
THE
OTTOMANS
SEEM
TO
HAVE
WELCOMED

TO
THEIR
TERRITORY
AND
TO
HAVE
FOUND

THE
COMMUNITIES
ALREADY
EXISTING
IN
PLACES
WHICH
THEY
CONQUERED
A
COOPERATIVE

THE
JEWISH
RESPONSE
TO
THIS
TOLERANCE

A
STEADY
FLOW
OF

CHRISTIAN
COUNTRIES

OTTOMAN
DOMAINS

FROM
THE
PERIOD
BEFORE
WE
HAVE
ONLY
A
FEW
INDICATIONS
THAT
THE
OTTOMANJEWISH
RELATIONSHIP
WAS
WELL
ON
THE
COURSE
OF
AMITY

WOULD
CHARACTERIZE
IT
FOR
YEARS
AFTERWARD

THE
LIBERALITY

THE
INTOLERANCE

THE
BYZANTINES

THE
PROTECTION

THE

ELSEWHERE
LEAVE
LITTLE
DOUPT
THAT
EVEN
THEN
BOTH
THE
OTTOMANS

THE
JEWS
RECOGNIZED
THEIR
MUTUAL
INTERESTS

IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
SAY
HOW
FUNDAMENTAL
THE
JEWS
WERE

THE
SUCCESS
OF
THE
OTTOMANS
IN
REBUILDING
ISTANBUL
OR
IN
OTTOMAN
MERCANTILE
SUCCESS
IN
THE
SIXTEENTH
CENTURY
THAT
THEY
PLAYED
AN
IMPORTANT
ROLE
IN
BOTH
CANNOT
BE
DOUPTED
IT
IS
ALSO
UNCLEAR
WHETHER
THEY
WERE
IMPORTANT
ENOUGH
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
OTTOMANS
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
THEIR
GREAT
SUCCESS
WITHOUT
THE
JEWS

THAT
NO
OTHER
GROUP
COULD
HAVE
BEEN
FOUND

SERVE
THE
OTTOMANS
AS
WELL
AS
DID
THE
JEWS
IT
IS
HOWEVER
UNMISTAKABLY
CLEAR
THAT
THERE
ARE
FEW
PARALLELS
IN
WORLD
HISTORY
TO
THIS
REMARKABLE
PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN
JEWS
AND
THE
NONJEWISH
SOCIETY
IN
WHICH
THEY
LIVED

MUST
CONCLUDE
THAT
THE
OTTOMANS
COULD
PROBABLY
NOT
ACHIEVED
THEIR
SUCCESS
WITHOUT
A
