ISRAELI
DESTRUCTION
OF
MOSQUES

THIS
ISSUE
HAS
BEEN
GOING
ON
FOR
A
WHILE
AND
YOUR
PRESENTATION
HERE
OF
JUST
ONE
REFERENCE
PROBABLY
WONT
RESOLVE
THIS
ISSUE
TO
THOSE
THAT
OPPOSE
YOUR
INSISTENCE
THAT
MOSQUES
WERE
DESTROYED
EVEN
IN
YOUR
LOCATION
OF
THIS
ONE
REFERENCE
YOU
SPEND
MOST
OF
YOUR
QUOTE
DEALING
WITH
AN
INCIDENCE
THAT
WHILE
ABHORRANT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
ISSUE
AT
HAND
HERE
THEN
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
QUOTE
THERE
IS
AN
ALMOST
OFFHAND
COMMENT
THAT
TWO
MOSQUES
WERE
DESTROYED
TO
SUPPORT
A
CLAIM
OF
THIS
NATURE
WHAT
OTHER
AUTHORS
SUPPORT
THIS
INCIDENT
IF
IDENTIFIABLE
MOSQUES
WERE
DESTROYED
THEY
ARE
CERTAINLY
IDENTIFIABLE
THEY
HAVE
NAMES
AND
ADDRESSES
STEET
LOCATION
THE
COMMENT
BY
ONE
REPORTER
DOES
MAKE
US
WONDER
IF
THIS
HAPPENED
BUT
BY
NO
MEANS
PROVES
IT
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
ISRAELI
AUTHORITIES
ORDERED
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
MOSQUES
IN
THE
VICINITY
OF
THE
WAILING
WALL
THAT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
HOWEVER
THAT
ONCE
CAN
GENERALIZE
FROM
THIS
TO
ANY
OTHER
POINTS
THE
ENTIRE
PLAZA
MOSQUES
AND
ALL
WAS
CLEARED
TO
MAKE
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
JEWS
TO
HAVE
A
PLACE
TO
WORSHIP
IN
THE
PLACE
THAT
WAS
HOLIEST
TO
MANY
OF
THEM
AND
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
DENIED
TO
THEM
FOR
MILLENIA
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THROUGHOUT
THE
REST
OF
JERUSALEM
AND
ISRAEL
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
KNOWLEDGE
ISRAELI
AUTHORITIES
HAVE
SCRUPULOUSLY
AVOIDED
DAMAGE
TO
ANY
ISLAMIC
RELIGIOUS
SITES
THIS
CONTRASTS
WITH
THE
POLICIES
OF
PREVIOUS
REGIMES
WHICH
DESTROYED
JEWISH
SYNAGOGUES
OUT
OF
HATE
AND
BIGOTRY
