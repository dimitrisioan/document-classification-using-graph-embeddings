well
this
is
your
opinion
of
course
it
is
turkish
azeris
can
bark
all
they
want
since
the
above
is
untrue
however
i
am
sure
you
guys
would
have
never
brought
up
armenias
involvement
if
karabakhiarmenians
had
had
heavy
losses
and
this
is
your
opinion
it
is
not
any
more
valid
due
to
repeated
capital
letters
and
words
such
as
untrue
never
etc
read
what
the
new
york
times
that
is
publishing
antiarmenian
articles
nop
i
have
my
resources
look
everyone
knows
how
aggressive
turksazeris
have
been
in
the
past
armenians
are
not
gona
sit
around
and
watch
fire
works
by
azeris
taught
by
turks
so
armenians
are
justified
in
aggression
since
supposedly
turks
have
been
aggressive
in
the
past
i
dont
follow
your
logic
da
i
dont
wish
to
get
into
the
cyprus
discussion
turkey
had
the
right
to
not
a
chance
you
can
not
convince
me
based
on
your
reasonsthat
your
government
did
the
right
thing
to
invade
cyprus
i
have
said
that
i
dont
wish
to
get
into
cyprus
discussion
and
did
not
give
any
reasons
for
turkeys
involvement
i
also
am
not
trying
to
convince
you
of
anything
seeing
no
reason
to
waste
any
time
da
lastly
why
is
there
not
a
socculturearmenia
i
vote
yes
for
it
da
after
all
it
is
now
free
well
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
agree
or
disadree
with
you
i
am
serious
lets
get
socculturearmenia
started
and
have
some
peace
of
mind
