NEIER
REFLECTIONS
ON
BOSNIA
LORD
OWEN
AND
THE
SERBS
IN
EARLY
FEBRUARY
LORD
OWEN
MADE
APPEARANCES
IN
NEW
YORK
CITY
ON
THE
DONAHUE
AND
CHARLIE
ROSE
SHOWS
ON
A
COUPLE
OF
OCCASIONS
ON
THOSE
SHOWS
LORD
OWEN
GAVE
AWAY
HIS
PROSERBIAN
POSITION
WHEN
HE
MADE
THE
POINT
THAT
MUCH
OR
MOST
OF
THE
BOSNIAN
TERRITORY
THEN
IN
DISPUTE
OR
ALREADY
OVERRUN
BY
SERBIAN
FORCES
HAD
BEEN
CONTROLLED
AND
OCCUPIED
BY
SERBS
BEFORE
WWII
IT
WAS
AS
IF
HE
WERE
SAYING
THAT
SINCE
THE
SERBS
HAD
PREVIOUSLY
OCCUPIED
THOSE
TERRITORIES
AND
LOST
THEM
DURING
THE
HITLER
YEARS
THEY
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
RECONQUER
THEM
TODAY
I
WAS
FAMILIAR
WITH
THIS
VIEW
BECAUSE
MY
FATHER
A
YUGOSLAV
JEW
WHO
ESCAPED
TO
THIS
COUNTRY
DURING
THE
WAR
WAS
AIDED
AND
FOUND
SYMPATHY
AMONG
THE
SERBS
DURING
THOSE
HARROWING
YEARS
IN
RECENT
MONTHS
WHEN
THE
SUBJECT
OF
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
WAS
MENTIONED
MY
FATHER
WOULD
MAKE
THE
POINT
THAT
SERBS
WERE
KILLED
BY
NAZI
AND
PRONAZI
CROATIAN
FORCES
KNOWN
AS
THE
USTASHA
MY
FATHER
IS
SO
PROSERBIAN
THAT
HE
DISMISSED
REPORTS
OF
SERBIAN
ATROCITIES
MY
FATHER
ALSO
EXCORIATED
NEW
YORK
TIMES
COLUMNIST
ANTHONY
LEWIS
BECAUSE
MY
FATHER
SAID
ANTHONY
LEWIS
IS
ALWAYS
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
MUSLIMS
UPDATEAPRIL
AFTER
AN
UNEASY
TRUCE
IN
AND
AROUND
SBERNICA
SHELLING
HAS
RESUMED
IN
NEARBY
AREAS
BY
ALL
SIDES
AND
THE
KILLING
AND
THE
MISERY
CONTINUES
APACE
WHILE
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
DITHERS
ITS
RESPONSE
IN
THE
DAYS
LEADING
TO
THE
COLLAPSE
OF
RESISTANCE
AT
SBERNICA
LORD
OWEN
CHANGED
HIS
TUNE
PREVIOUSLY
HE
HAD
OPPOSED
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
ON
THE
GROUNDS
THAT
IT
WOULD
ENDANGER
UN
RELIEF
WORKERS
WHEN
SERBIAN
FORCES
BEGAN
TO
MARCH
ON
SBERNICA
THE
THREAT
TO
UN
RELIEF
SOLDIERS
WENT
UNMENTIONED
WHILE
LORD
OWEN
CALLED
FOR
OUTSIDE
INTERVENTION
TO
STOP
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
INCLUDING
THE
USE
OF
AIR
STRIKES
THE
CURRENT
DISASTROUS
SITUATION
CAN
BE
SEEN
AS
A
FAILURE
OF
THE
WEST
AND
A
FAILURE
OF
THE
VANCEOWEN
INITIATIVE
WHICH
DID
NOTHING
TO
HALT
THE
SERBS
NOW
THAT
ITS
TOO
LATE
TO
SAVE
MUSLIM
AREAS
THAT
LORD
OWEN
FELT
SHOULD
BE
IN
A
MUSLIM
STATE
LORD
OWEN
BELATEDLY
CALLS
FOR
STRONG
ACTION
CLINTON
AND
BOSNIA
IN
THE
SUMMER
OF
GEORGE
KENNEY
A
SENIOR

OFFICIAL
THE
UNDERSECRETARY
IN
CHARGE
OF
THE
YUGOSLAV
DESK
MADE
NEWS
WHEN
HE
RESIGNED
FROM
THE
STATE
DEPARTMENT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
BUSH
ADMINISTRATIONS
REFUSAL
TO
TAKE
ANY
ACTION
TO
HALT
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
AS
KENNEY
SAW
IT
BUSHS
INACTION
WAS
LARGELY
DUE
TO
THE
PRESIDENTS
UNWILLINGNESS
TO
RISK
ANY
POLITICAL
CAPITAL
BY
GETTING
INVOLVED
THERE
APPARENTLY
THE
SAME
IS
TRUE
OF
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
CLINTON
GIVES
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
HE
CARES
MORE
THAN
BUSH
DID
ABOUT
THE
TERRIBLE
ONGOING
TRAGEDY
BUT
THE
PRACTICAL
EFFECT
HAS
SO
FAR
BEEN
THE
SAME
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NEW
YORK
TIMES
THE
CLINTON
ADMINISTRATION
DID
EVERYTHING
IT
COULD
TO
SUPPRESS
A
MIDMARCH
REPORT
BY
ITS
OWN
EXPERTS
WHICH
CALLED
FOR
MILITARY
ACTION
IF
NECESSARY
TO
PROTECT
SAFE
HAVENS
FOR
THE
MUSLIMS
AT
ONE
POINT
SENATE
MAJORITY
LEADER
GEORGE
MITCHELL
WAS
SO
INCENSED
THAT
THE
REPORT
WAS
KEPT
FROM

THAT
HE
CALLED
FOR
AN
INVESTIGATION
INSTEAD
OF
HELPING
THE
DESPERATE
BOSNIANS
CLINTON
HAS
SIGNALLED
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN
THAT
MILOSEVIC
AND
THE
SERBS
ARE
FREE
TO
DO
WHAT
THEY
WANT
IN
BOSNIAINDEED
CLINTON
AND
THE
WEST
HAVE
BEEN
SIGNALLING
THAT
THE
SERBS
SHOULD
GET
ON
WITH
THE
JOB
AND
FINISH
OFF
THE
BOSNIANS
AS
QUICKLY
AS
POSSIBLE
WHILE
WE
TURN
THE
OTHER
WAY
A
KEY
SIGNAL
WAS
WHEN
CLINTON
MADE
IT
CLEAR
THAT
HE
WOULD
NOT
SEND
IN
AMERICAN
MILITARY
FORCES
ON
THE
GROUND
ON
THIS
ISSUE
CLINTON
HAS
MADE
ME
WISTFUL
FOR

AND

THE

THE

WARNS
THAT
THOSE

ON
THE

OF
THE

HAD
BETTER
REVIEW
US
FOREIGN

SINCE

THE

ARGUES
FOR

ANTHONY

COMES
CLOSE
TO
THE
POINT
WHEN
HE
ASKS
WHY
DOES
RESPECT
FOR
CLINTONS
PRESIDENCY
DEPENDON
HIS
ACTING
EFFECTIVELY
AGAINST
SERBIAN
AGGRESSIONFIRST
OF
ALL
BECAUSE
TO
DO
NOTHING
ABOUT

WOULD
BE
SUCH
A
BETRAYAL
OF
THE
VALUES
WE
AND
OUR
ALLIES
PROFESS
TIMES
BUT
ITS
NOT
MERELY
A
BETRAYAL
OF
OUR
VALUES
ITS
BECAUSE
THE
SERBS
ARE
ATTACKING
US
BY
PROXY
JUST
AS
HITLER
WAS
ONE
ARGUMENT
FOR
DECISIVE
ACTION
BY
THE
WEST
THAT
IS
HEARD
IN
A
DIFFERENT
FORM
IS
THAT
WAR
IN
THE
BALKANS
IS
DESTABLIZING
FOR
EUROPE
WE
HEAR
IT
AS
THE
BOSNIANS
ARE
EUROPES
PALESTINIANS
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
JUST
AS
THE
PALESTINIAN
REFUGEE
PROBLEM
HAS
BEEN
THE
KEY
TO
INSTABILITY
IN
THE
MIDDLE
EAST
JUST
SO
WILL
THE
HUNDREDS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
YUGOSLAV
REFUGEES
OF
ALL
ETHNICITIES
RESULT
IN
TURMOIL
IN
EUROPE
FOR
DECADES
TO

OF
THE

OF

IS
THAT
EVEN

DIVIDES
US
THE
AMERICAS
ARE
ULTIMATELY
TIED
TO
THE
DESTINY
OF
EUROPE
IF
EUROPE
IS
DESTABILIZED
THE
US
WILL
INEVITABLY
BE
AFFECTED
AND
DRAWN
INTO
ITS
PROBLEMS
AS
IN
A
WHIRLPOOL
SOONER
OR
LATER
WE
WILL
BE
DRAWN
INTO
THE
MAELSTROM
AND
AS
PAST
HISTORY
AND

HAVE
SHOWN
ITS
MUCH
BETTER
IF
WE
