WRITES
I
LIKE
WHAT
MR
JOSEPH
BIDEN
HAD
TO
SAY
YESTERDAY
IN
THE
SENATE
CONDEMENING
THE
EUROPEAN
LACK
OF
ACTION
AND
LACK
OF
SUPPORT
TO
US
PLANS
AND
CALLING
THAT
MORAL
RAPE
HE
WENT
ON
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
REASON
FOR
THAT
IS
OUT
RIGHT
RELIGIOUS
BIGOTRY
PARTS
OF
SEN
BIDENS
STATEMENT
WERE
QUOTED
BY
THE
WASHINGTON
POST
TODAY
LET
ME
PUT
IT
PLAINLY
MR
SECRETARY
YOU
ARE
REQUIRED
TO
SPEAK
DIPLOMATICALLY
I
AM
NOT
I
CANNOT
EVEN
BEGIN
TO
EXPRESS
TO
YOU
MY
CONTEMPT
FOR
A
EUROPEAN
POLICY
THAT
IS
NOW
ASKING
US
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
WHAT
AMOUNTS
TO
A
CODIFICATION
OF
THE
SERBIAN
VICTORY
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
ENCOUNTERED
IS
A
DISCOURAGING
MOSAIC
OF
INDIFFERENCE
TIMIDITY
SELFDELUSION
AND
HYPOCRISY
AFTER
THEY
HELD
OUR
COATS
ON
KUWAIT
AND
SOMALIA
THEY
ARE
ASKING
US
TO
PUT
IN
A
FEW
THOUSAND
TROOPS
ON
THE
GROUND
IN
ORDER
TO
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
SPEAK
AND
IN
ORDER
TO
IMPLEMENT
THEIR
NEW
IDEA
OF
SAFE
HAVENS
FOR
THE
BOSNIANS
LETS
NOT
MINCE
WORDS
EUROPEAN
POLICY
IS
BASED
ON
CULTURAL
AND
RELIGIOUS
INDIFFERENCE
IF
NOT
BIGOTRY
AND
I
THINK
ITS
FAIR
TO
SAY
THAT
THIS
WOULD
BE
AN
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
SITUATION
IF
THE
MUSLIMS
WERE
DOING
WHAT
THE
SERBS
HAVE
DONE
IF
THIS
WAS
MUSLIM
AGGRESSION
INSTEAD
OF
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
TOO
BAD
THE
WASHINGTON
POST
DID
NOT
INCLUDE
HIS
NEXT
SENTENCE
WHICH
POINTED
OUT
THAT
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
SUCH
POLICY
IS
A
RISING
ANGER
WITHIN
THE
ISLAMIC
WORLD
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
WHICH
WE
CANNOT
BEGIN
TO
PREDICT
LATER
BIDEN
TOLD
A
REPORTER
WHY
HE
SPOKE
OUT
I
THINK
SOMEONE
HAS
TO
RESPOND
TO
EUROPE
TO
MAKE
IT
CLEAR
THIS
IS
A
BIG
DEAL
SO
THEY
WILL
UNDERSTAND
AND
IT
IS
A
BIG
DEAL
BY
REFUSING
THE
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHT
OF
SELFDEFENSE
TO
BOSNIAHERZEGOVINA
EUROPE
AND
THE
WORLD
HAVE
AIDED
THE
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
MOREOVER
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
HAS
FORCED
A
SITUATION
IN
WHICH
BOSNIAN
SERBS
HAVE
TIMES
MORE
HEAVY
WEAPONRY
THAN
BOSNIAN
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
COMBINED
UNDER
SUCH
CONDITIONS
IT
IS
VERY
EASY
FOR
SERBS
TO
PLAY
A
DIVIDEANDCONQUER
GAME
AND
TO
GET
THE
MUSLIMS
AND
CROATS
WHO
HAVE
STRONG
COMMON
INTERESTS
AND
WHO
WERE
ALLIED
AGAINST
THE
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
TO
START
FIGHTING
EACH
OTHER
WHICH
LEADS
TO
THEIR
MUTUAL
CATASTROPHE
ONE
FINAL
QUOTE
US
SECRETARY
OF
STATE
WARREN
CHRISTOPHER
HAS
SAID
IN
ROME
LAST
WEEK
THAT
IN
PRACTICE
THE
EMBARGO
HAD
THE
OPPOSITE
EFFECT
INTENDED
IT
MADE
AGGRESSION
CERTAIN
ALL
DIPLOMATS
WHO
DELUDED
THEMSELVES
THAT
THEY
COULD
NEGOTIATE
PEACE
WHILE
ENFORCING
A
IMBALANCE
OF
POWER
ON
THE
GROUND
HAVE
CONTRIBUTED
TO
THIS
TRAGEDY
SINCERELY
JOSIP
