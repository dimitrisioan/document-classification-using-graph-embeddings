PROPOSAL
A
UNCONVENTIONAL
PROPOSAL
FOR
PEACE
IN
THE
MIDDLEEAST
BY
ELIAS
DAVIDSSON
THE
FOLLOWING
PROPOSAL
IS
BASED
ON
THE
FOLLOWING
ASSUMPTIONS
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHTS
SUCH
AS
THE
RIGHT
TO
LIFE
TO
EDUCATION
TO
ESTABLISH
A
FAMILY
AND
HAVE
CHILDREN
TO
HUMAN
DIGNITY
THE
RIGHT
TO
FREE
MOVEMENT
TO
FREE
EXPRESSION
ETC
ARE
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
HUMAN
EXISTENCE
THAT
THE
RIGHTS
OF
STATES
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
A
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
BASIC
HUMAN
RIGHTS
AND
RIGHTS
OF
COLLECTIVITIES
BASIC
HUMAN
RIGHTS
SHOULD
PREVAIL
BETWEEN
THE
COLLECTIVITIES
DEFINING
THEMSELVES
AS
JEWISHISRAELI
AND
PALESTINIANARAB
HOWEVER
LABELLED
AN
UNRESOLVED
CONFLICT
EXISTS
THIS
CONFLICT
HAS
CAUSED
GREAT
SUFFERINGS
FOR
MILLIONS
OF
PEOPLE
IT
MOREOVER
POISONS
RELATIONS
BETWEEN
COMMUNITIES
PEOPLES
AND
NATIONS
EACH
YEAR
THE
UNITED
STATES
EXPENDS
BILLIONS
OF
DOLLARS
IN
ECONOMIC
AND
MILITARY
AID
TO
THE
CONFLICTING
PARTIES
ATTEMPTS
TO
SOLVE
THE
ISRAELIARAB
CONFLICT
BY
TRADITIONAL
POLITICAL
MEANS
HAVE
FAILED
AS
LONG
AS
THE
CONFLICT
IS
PERCEIVED
AS
THAT
BETWEEN
TWO
DISTINCT
ETHNICALRELIGIOUS
COMMUNITIESPEOPLES
WHICH
CLAIM
THE
LAND
THERE
IS
NO
JUST
NOR
PEACEFUL
SOLUTION
POSSIBLE
LOVE
BETWEEN
HUMAN
BEINGS
CAN
BE
CAPITALIZED
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
PEACE
AND
JUSTICE
WHEN
PEOPLE
LOVE
THEY
SHARE
HAVING
STATED
MY
ASSUMPTIONS
I
WILL
NOW
STATE
MY
PROPOSAL
A
FUND
SHOULD
BE
ESTABLISHED
WHICH
WOULD
DISBURSE
GRANTS
FOR
EACH
CHILD
BORN
TO
A
COUPLE
WHERE
ONE
PARTNER
IS
ISRAELIJEW
AND
THE
OTHER
PALESTINIANARAB
TO
BE
ENTITLED
FOR
A
GRANT
A
COUPLE
WILL
HAVE
TO
PROVE
THAT
ONE
OF
THE
PARTNERS
POSSESSES
OR
IS
ENTITLED
TO
ISRAELI
CITIZENSHIP
UNDER
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
AND
THE
OTHER
PARTNER
ALTHOUGH
BORN
IN
AREAS
UNDER
CURRENT
ISREALI
CONTROL
IS
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
SUCH
CITIZENSHIP
UNDER
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
FOR
THE
FIRST
CHILD
THE
GRANT
WILL
AMOUNT
TO
FOR
THE
SECOND
THE
THIRD
CHILD
FOR
EACH
CHILD
FOR
EACH
SUBSEQUENT
CHILD
THE
GRANT
WILL
AMOUNT
TO
FOR
EACH
CHILD
THE
FUND
WOULD
BE
FINANCED
BY
A
VARIETY
OF
SOURCES
WHICH
HAVE
SHOWN
INTEREST
IN
PROMOTING
A
PEACEFUL
SOLUTION
TO
THE
ISRAELIARAB
CONFLICT
INCLUDING
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
JEWISH
AND
CHRISTIAN
ORGANIZATIONS
IN
THE
US
AND
A
GREAT
NUMBER
OF
GOVERNMENTS
AND
INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS
THE
EMERGENCE
OF
A
CONSIDERABLE
NUMBER
OF
MIXED
MARRIAGES
IN
ISRAELPALESTINE
ALL
OF
WHOM
WOULD
HAVE
RELATIVES
ON
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
DIVIDE
WOULD
MAKE
THE
CONFLICT
LOSE
ITS
ETHNICAL
AND
UNSOLUBLE
CORE
AND
STRENGTHEN
THE
EMERGENCE
OF
A
TRULY
CIVIL
SOCIETY
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
STRONG
MIXED
STOCK
OF
PEOPLE
WOULD
ALSO
HELP
THE
INTEGRATION
OF
ISRAELI
SOCIETY
INTO
THE
MIDDLEEAST
IN
A
GRACEFUL
MANNER
OBJECTIONS
TO
THIS
PROPOSAL
WILL
CERTAINLY
BE
VOICED
I
WILL
ATTEMPT
TO
IDENTIFY
SOME
OF
THESE
THE
IDEA
OF
PROVIDING
FINANCIAL
INCENTIVES
TO
SELECTED
FORMS
OF
PARTNERSHIP
AND
MARRIAGE
IS
NOT
CONVENTIONAL
HOWEVER
IT
IS
BASED
ON
THE
CONCEPT
OF
AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION
WHICH
IS
RECOGNIZED
AS
A
LEGITIMATE
FORM
OF
PUBLIC
POLICY
TO
REVERSE
THE
PERVERSE
EFFECTS
OF
SEGREGATION
AND
DISCRIMINATION
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
CLEARLY
PERMITS
AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION
WHEN
IT
IS
AIMED
AT
REDUCING
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
AND
SEGREGATION
IT
MAY
BE
OBJECTED
THAT
THE
ISRAELIPALESTINIAN
CONFLICT
IS
NOT
PRIMARILY
A
RELIGIOUS
OR
ETHNICAL
CONFLICT
BUT
THAT
IT
IS
A
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
A
COLONIALIST
SETTLER
SOCIETY
AND
AN
INDIGENOUS
COLONIZED
SOCIETY
THAT
CAN
ONLY
REGAIN
ITS
FREEDOM
BY
ARMED
STRUGGLE
THIS
OBJECTION
IS
BASED
ON
THE
ASSUMPTION
THAT
THE
ENEMY
IS
NOT
ZIONISM
AS
IDEOLOGY
AND
PRACTICE
BUT
ISRAELIJEWISH
SOCIETY
AND
ITS
MEMBERS
WHICH
WILL
HAVE
TO
BE
DEFEATED
THIS
OBJECTION
HAS
NO
MERIT
BECAUSE
IT
DOES
NOT
FULFILL
THE
FIRST
TWO
ASSUMPTIONS
CONCERNING
THE
PRIMACY
OF
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHTS
OVER
COLLECTIVE
RIGHTS
SEE
ABOVE
FUNDAMENTALIST
JEWS
WOULD
CERTAINLY
OBJECT
TO
THE
USE
OF
FINANCIAL
INCENTIVES
TO
ENCOURAGE
MIXED
MARRIAGES
FROM
THEIR
POINT
OF
VIEW
THE
CONTINUED
EXISTENCE
OF
A
SPECIFIC
JEWISH
PEOPLE
OVERRIDES
ANY
OTHER
CONSIDERATION
BE
IT
HUMAN
LOVE
PEACE
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
WORLD
JEWISH
CONGRESS
EDGAR
BRONFMAN
REFLECTED
THIS
VIEW
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
IN
AN
INTERVIEW
HE
GAVE
TO
DER
SPIEGEL
A
GERMAN
MAGAZINE
HE
CALLED
THE
INCREASING
ASSIMILATION
OF
JEWS
IN
THE
WORLD
A
CALAMITY
COMPARABLE
IN
ITS
EFFECTS
ONLY
WITH
THE
HOLOCAUST
THIS
OBJECTION
HAS
NO
MERIT
EITHER
BECAUSE
IT
DOES
NOT
FULFILL
THE
FIRST
TWO
ASSUMPTIONS
SEE
ABOVE
IT
MAY
OBJECTED
THAT
ONLY
A
FEW
PEOPLE
IN
ISRAELPALESTINE
WOULD
REQUEST
SUCH
GRANTS
AND
THAT
IT
WOULD
THUS
NOT
SERVE
ITS
PURPOSE
TO
THIS
OBJECTION
ONE
MIGHT
RESPOND
THAT
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
DETERMINE
WITH
CERTAINTY
THE
EFFECT
OF
SUCH
A
PROPOSAL
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
SUCH
A
FUND
WOULD
HELP
MIXED
COUPLES
TO
RESIST
THE
PRESSURE
OF
THEIR
RESPECTIVE
SOCIETIES
AND
ENCOURAGE
YOUNG
COUPLES
TO
REJECT
FUNDAMENTALIST
AND
RACIST
ATTITUDES
IT
MAY
OBJECTED
THAT
SUCH
A
FUND
WOULD
NEED
GREAT
SUMS
TO
BRING
ABOUT
SUBSTANTIAL
DEMOGRAPHIC
CHANGES
THIS
OBJECTION
HAS
MERITS
HOWEVER
IT
MUST
BE
REMEMBERED
THAT
HUGE
SUMS
MORE
THAN
BILLION
ARE
EXPENDED
EACH
YEAR
BY
THE
UNITED
STATES
GOVERNMENT
AND
BY
US
ORGANIZATIONS
TO
MAINTAIN
AN
ELUSIVE
PEACE
IN
THE
MIDDLEEAST
THROUGH
ARMAMENTS
A
MERE
FRACTION
OF
THESE
SUMS
WOULD
SUFFICE
TO
LAUNCH
THE
ABOVE
PROPOSAL
AND
CREATE
A
MORE
FAVORABLE
CLIMATE
TOWARDS
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
MIXED
MARRIAGES
IN
ISRAELPALESTINE
THUS
ENCOURAGING
THE
EMERGENCE
OF
A
NONSEGREGATED
SOCIETY
IN
THAT
WORNTORN
LAND
I
WOULD
BE
THANKFUL
FOR
CRITICAL
COMMENTS
TO
THE
ABOVE
PROPOSAL
AS
WELL
FOR
ANY
DISSEMINATION
OF
THIS
PROPOSAL
FOR
MEANINGFUL
DISCUSSION
AND
ENRICHMENT
