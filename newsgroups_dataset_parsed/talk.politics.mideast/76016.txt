now
wait
there
is
more
the
gruesome
extent
of
februarys
killings
of
azeris
by
armenians
in
the
town
of
hojali
is
at
last
emerging
in
azerbaijan
about
men
women
and
children
dead
in
the
worst
outrage
of
the
fouryear
war
over
nagorny
karabakh
the
figure
is
drawn
from
azeri
investigators
hojali
officials
and
casualty
lists
published
in
the
baku
press
diplomats
and
aid
workers
say
the
death
toll
is
in
line
with
their
own
estimates
the
february
attack
on
hojali
by
armenian
forces
was
one
of
the
last
moves
in
their
fouryear
campaign
to
take
full
control
of
nagorny
karabakh
the
subject
of
a
new
round
of
negotiations
in
rome
on
monday
the
bloodshed
was
something
between
a
fighting
retreat
and
a
massacre
but
investigators
say
that
most
of
the
dead
were
civilians
the
awful
number
of
people
killed
was
first
suppressed
by
the
fearful
former
communist
government
in
baku
later
it
was
blurred
by
armenian
denials
and
griefstricken
azerbaijans
wild
and
contradictory
allegations
of
up
to
dead
the
state
prosecuter
aydin
rasulov
the
cheif
investigator
of
a
team
looking
into
what
azerbaijan
calls
the
hojali
disaster
said
his
figure
of
people
dead
was
a
minimum
on
preliminary
findings
a
similar
estimate
was
given
by
elman
memmedov
the
mayor
of
hojali
an
even
higher
one
was
printed
in
the
baku
newspaper
ordu
in
may
dead
people
named
and
more
than
bodies
reported
unidentified
this
figure
of
nearly
dead
is
quoted
as
official
by
leila
yunusova
the
new
spokeswoman
of
the
azeri
ministry
of
defence
francois
zen
ruffinen
head
of
delegation
of
the
international
red
cross
in
baku
said
the
muslim
imam
of
the
nearby
city
of
agdam
had
reported
a
figure
of
bodies
received
at
his
mosque
from
hojali
most
of
them
civilians
we
did
not
count
the
bodies
but
the
figure
seems
reasonable
it
is
no
fantasy
mr
zen
ruffinen
said
we
have
some
idea
since
we
gave
the
body
bags
and
products
to
wash
the
dead
mr
rasulov
endeavours
to
give
an
unemotional
estimate
of
the
number
of
dead
in
the
massacre
dont
get
worked
up
it
will
take
several
months
to
get
a
final
figure
the
lawyer
said
at
his
small
office
mr
rasulov
knows
about
these
things
it
took
him
two
years
to
reach
a
firm
conclusion
that
people
were
killed
and
wounded
when
soviet
troops
and
tanks
crushed
a
nationalist
uprising
in
baku
in
january
those
nationalists
the
popular
front
finally
came
to
power
three
weeks
ago
and
are
applying
pressure
to
find
out
exactly
what
happened
when
hojali
an
azeri
town
which
lies
about
miles
from
the
border
with
armenia
fell
to
the
armenians
officially
people
have
so
far
been
certified
as
dead
being
the
number
of
people
that
could
be
medically
examined
by
the
republics
forensic
department
this
is
just
a
small
percentage
of
the
dead
said
rafiq
youssifov
the
republics
chief
forensic
scientist
they
were
the
only
bodies
brought
to
us
remember
the
chaos
and
the
fact
that
we
are
muslims
and
have
to
wash
and
bury
our
dead
within
hours
of
these
people
were
women
and
were
children
under
years
old
gunshots
killed
people
shrapnel
killed
and
axes
or
blunt
instruments
killed
exposure
in
the
highland
snows
killed
the
last
three
thirtythree
people
showed
signs
of
deliberate
mutilation
including
ears
noses
breasts
or
penises
cut
off
and
eyes
gouged
out
according
to
professor
youssifovs
report
those
bodies
examined
were
less
than
a
third
of
those
believed
to
have
been
killed
mr
rasulov
said
files
from
mr
rasulovs
investigative
commission
are
still
disorganised
lists
of
azeri
militiamen
are
dead
here
six
policemen
there
and
in
handwriting
of
a
mosque
attendant
the
names
of
corpses
brought
to
be
washed
in
just
one
day
the
most
heartbreaking
account
from
witnesses
interviewed
so
far
comes
from
towfiq
manafov
an
azeri
investigator
who
took
a
helicopter
flight
over
the
escape
route
from
hojali
on
february
there
were
too
many
bodies
of
dead
and
wounded
on
the
ground
to
count
properly
in
hojali
people
by
the
stream
and
the
road
and
visible
around
nakhchivanik
village
mr
manafov
wrote
in
a
statement
countersigned
by
the
helicopter
pilot
people
waved
up
to
us
for
help
we
saw
three
dead
children
and
one
twoyearold
alive
by
one
dead
woman
the
live
one
was
pulling
at
her
arm
for
the
mother
to
get
up
we
tried
to
land
but
armenians
started
a
barrage
against
our
helicopter
and
we
had
to
return
there
has
been
no
consolidation
of
the
lists
and
figures
in
circulation
because
of
the
political
upheavals
of
the
last
few
months
and
the
fact
that
nobody
knows
exactly
who
was
in
hojali
at
the
time
many
inhabitants
were
displaced
from
other
villages
taken
over
by
armenian
forces
the
independent
london
serdar
argic
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
turks
and
then
proceeded
in
the
work
of
extermination
ohanus
appressian
in
soviet
armenia
today
there
no
longer
exists
a
single
turkish
soul
