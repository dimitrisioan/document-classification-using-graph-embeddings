i
spent
almost
all
of
february
doing
overhaul
the
was
a
short
day
at
work
we
worked
until
eleven
or
eleventhirty
and
left
for
home
i
decided
to
go
for
a
short
walk
i
went
to
primorsky
park
i
walked
past
the
eternal
flame
and
saw
a
group
of
about
to
people
standing
there
when
i
had
walked
another
to
yards
i
heard
the
screech
of
automobile
brakes
behind
me
i
turned
my
head
toward
the
sound
it
was
a
light
blue
volga
i
see
that
the
people
who
were
standing
there
have
gone
over
to
the
car
a
man
and
a
woman
get
out
the
man
is
expensively
dressed
in
a
suit
and
the
woman
has
a
raincoat
on
she
doesnt
have
anything
on
her
head
and
her
hair
is
let
down
sightly
reddish
hair
a
heavyset
woman
theyre
to
years
old
they
get
something
out
of
the
trunk
the
people
start
to
help
them
i
become
curious
just
what
are
they
pulling
out
of
there
when
i
got
up
close
i
heard
them
turn
something
on
i
didnt
see
what
it
was
but
it
was
probably
a
tape
recorder
they
put
it
on
the
ground
near
the
eternal
flame
honoring
the
baku
commissars
and
formed
a
tight
circle
around
it
i
ask
whats
going
on
someone
tells
me
come
listen
well
they
were
azerbaijanis
i
had
asked
in
azerbaijani
i
hear
appeals
brother
muslims
our
time
has
come
and
something
else
along
that
line
i
didnt
understand
what
it
was
all
about
i
walked
around
the
group
trying
to
get
a
look
at
the
owner
of
the
tape
recorder
but
the
circle
drew
in
tighter
new
people
started
coming
from
various
directions
five
here
seven
there
and
the
comments
started
right
we
should
slaughter
the
armenians
and
theres
no
need
to
be
afraid
all
of
moscow
is
behind
us
i
even
heard
that
all
moscow
is
behind
us
well
i
watched
and
listened
in
and
realized
that
this
was
no
joke
i
quietly
left
and
went
home
now
before
that
at
work
i
had
heard
that
something
was
going
on
in
karabagh
that
there
were
demonstrations
there
well
people
were
saying
all
kinds
of
things
but
i
didnt
have
any
idea
what
was
really
going
on
my
wife
and
son
were
at
home
but
my
daughter
was
at
my
aunts
house
in
baku
i
didnt
say
anything
to
my
wife
we
sat
and
drank
tea
sometime
around
two
oclock
right
behind
our
house
suddenly
there
is
noise
whistling
and
shouting
i
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
a
crowd
the
crowd
is
moving
slowly
like
they
show
on
tv
when
blacks
in
south
africa
are
striking
or
having
a
demonstration
and
move
slowly
my
wife
asks
whats
going
on
out
there
i
say
i
dont
know
i
put
on
some
outdoor
clothes
and
went
out
to
find
out
what
it
was
all
about
in
the
crowd
people
are
shouting
down
with
the
armenians
and
death
to
the
armenians
i
waited
for
the
entire
crowd
to
pass
at
first
they
went
down
narimanov
street
on
the
side
with
the
sk
club
and
the
city
party
committee
then
they
turned
and
went
against
the
trafficits
one
way
theredown
the
street
of
the
baku
commissars
toward
the
streetcar
line
i
went
home
and
told
my
wife
there
was
a
demonstration
going
on
in
fact
i
thought
that
we
were
having
the
same
kind
of
demonstrations
that
they
had
had
in
yerevan
and
in
karabagh
aside
from
the
things
they
were
shouting
i
was
surprised
that
there
were
only
young
people
in
the
crowd
and
they
were
minors
under
draft
age
my
wife
and
son
wanted
to
go
upstairs
to
visit
a
friend
but
i
was
kind
of
uneasy
and
said
no
lets
stay
at
home
instead
an
hour
went
by
or
maybe
an
hour
and
a
half
well
i
wasnt
keeping
track
of
the
time
i
cant
say
exactly
how
long
it
was
i
look
and
see
another
crowd
on
narimanov
but
now
on
the
side
with
the
microdistricts
the
bazaar
and
the
rossiya
movie
theater
i
put
outside
clothes
on
and
went
out
again
theres
noise
an
uproar
outside
and
the
crowd
has
grown
there
are
more
people
and
whereas
the
first
time
there
were
individual
shouts
this
time
they
are
more
focused
more
aggressive
no
i
think
somethings
wrong
here
this
isnt
any
demonstration
they
would
run
stop
then
walk
quickly
and
make
sharp
dashes
and
then
run
again
i
was
walking
along
the
sidewalk
and
they
were
in
the
street
i
followed
them
i
was
thinking
id
just
watch
and
see
who
knew
where
this
was
leading
we
came
out
on
lenin
square
at
the
square
the
sk
club
is
on
one
side
and
the
city
party
committee
is
on
the
other
i
went
toward
the
square
and
heard
noise
and
shouting
as
though
the
whole
town
had
turned
out
there
was
some
sort
of
a
rally
going
on
i
go
closer
and
hear
exclamations
appeals
i
heard
both
antiarmenian
and
antisoviet
appeals
we
dont
need
perestroika
we
want
to
go
on
living
like
we
have
been
now
what
did
they
mean
by
living
like
we
have
been
the
azerbaijanis
work
like
everyone
else
but
too
many
people
live
at
the
expense
of
the
government
and
at
the
expense
of
others
speculation
theft
and
cheating
go
on
all
the
time
and
not
just
in
azerbaijan
everywhere
in
all
the
republics
but
ive
never
seen
it
anywhere
else
like
i
have
in
azerbaijan
now
at
this
rally
someone
says
that
they
should
go
around
to
the
armenians
apartments
and
drive
them
out
beat
them
and
drive
them
out
true
i
didnt
hear
them
say
kill
them
over
the
microphone
i
only
heard
beat
them
and
drive
them
out
i
stayed
at
the
square
a
few
minutes
longer
first
one
then
another
are
going
up
onto
the
stage
and
no
one
tries
to
stop
the
crowd
off
to
the
side
of
the
crowd
there
were
small
groups
of
three
or
four
people
and
i
think
they
were
mvd
ministry
of
internal
affairs
or
state
security
kgb
there
were
also
uniformed
policemen
there
but
i
didnt
see
any
of
them
try
to
pacify
the
crowd
new
people
kept
coming
up
onto
the
stage
well
i
had
finally
decided
that
this
could
end
badly
this
was
no
demonstration
and
i
had
to
protect
my
family
i
left
the
square
to
return
home
and
suddenly
noticed
a
truck
it
was
next
to
the
city
party
committee
on
narimanov
street
it
stood
next
to
the
tai
lors
shop
there
a
low
truck
and
it
had
low
wooden
panels
i
see
that
some
thing
is
being
unloaded
crates
of
some
sort
i
decided
to
go
look
because
after
all
those
appeals
i
was
apprehensive
and
thought
there
might
be
weapons
in
there
they
pulled
the
crates
out
onto
the
square
not
toward
the
city
party
committee
but
toward
the
sk
club
and
when
i
went
right
up
to
them
i
saw
that
they
were
cases
of
vodka
there
were
two
people
handing
down
the
cases
from
the
bed
of
the
truck
and
on
the
ground
there
were
many
people
to
they
were
handing
them
down
from
the
truck
and
each
case
was
carried
off
by
two
people
two
people
one
case
of
vodka
and
there
was
a
man
standing
right
next
to
the
truck
and
he
was
handing
out
roundish
black
lumps
maybe
about
the
size
of
a
fist
maybe
a
little
bigger
or
smaller
it
was
anasha
when
i
passed
next
to
that
person
he
stood
with
his
side
to
me
there
was
about
a
yard
and
a
half
between
us
and
two
people
were
standing
near
him
he
has
a
package
in
his
hand
and
hes
pulling
out
anasha
and
handing
it
out
i
have
never
smoked
it
myself
once
i
tried
it
for
fun
but
ive
seen
a
lot
of
people
smoke
it
ive
seen
it
many
times
and
i
know
what
it
is
i
strolled
around
and
no
one
asked
me
who
i
was
or
what
i
was
doing
there
before
i
got
to
the
glass
bazaar
i
heard
more
howling
more
warlike
shouting
i
turned
around
and
saw
them
running
well
ill
just
keep
on
going
like
i
am
i
thought
when
they
caught
up
with
me
i
saw
that
they
were
carrying
flags
and
i
recognized
the
person
who
was
carrying
the
flag
on
my
side
of
the
street
hes
a
young
guy
or
years
old
he
was
carrying
a
red
flag
which
had
ermeni
oryum
written
on
it
in
azerbaijani
that
means
death
to
armenians
that
guy
used
to
live
off
the
same
courtyard
as
us
i
dont
really
know
what
his
name
is
but
i
know
his
father
very
well
his
fathers
name
is
rafik
he
used
to
be
a
cook
and
then
became
head
chef
he
used
to
have
a
dark
blue
zhiguli
van
then
he
sold
it
and
now
he
has
a
white
zhiguli
his
family
as
i
said
lived
on
the
same
courtyard
as
we
did
our
building
was
on
narimanov
street
and
theirs
was
on
the
street
of
the
baku
commissars
their
apartment
was
in
the
far
entryway
on
the
fifth
floor
the
door
on
the
left
now
rafiks
little
brother
lives
there
and
he
rafik
i
heard
got
a
new
apartment
either
in
the
forth
or
eighth
microdistrict
in
a
word
his
son
was
carrying
a
flag
that
said
death
to
armenians
i
was
surprised
because
before
this
i
had
gotten
the
impression
that
all
of
this
nonsense
was
being
done
not
by
people
from
sumgait
but
by
azerbaijanis
from
agdam
and
kafan
well
anyway
i
went
home
my
wife
was
upset
i
told
her
its
ok
itll
pass
theyre
young
kids
theyve
just
gotten
all
whooped
up
naturally
i
didnt
want
her
to
get
overly
upset
after
a
while
a
new
surge
of
crowd
went
by
and
this
time
they
were
breaking
glass
i
could
hear
it
breaking
but
i
couldnt
see
where
well
i
think
here
we
go
the
machines
in
motion
they
werent
handing
out
that
vodka
and
anasha
for
nothing
i
didnt
see
people
drinking
and
smoking
on
the
spot
but
they
certainly
hadnt
unloaded
the
vodka
and
hashish
to
put
in
a
store
window
so
the
thought
flashed
through
my
head
that
the
machine
was
running
no
one
would
stop
them
now
they
werent
even
trying
although
ill
say
it
again
the
police
were
there
i
saw
them
and
its
not
just
that
the
police
werent
breaking
them
up
they
were
joking
with
them
they
were
having
a
good
time
true
at
the
time
i
couldnt
even
imagine
that
under
our
government
our
much
vaunted
leadershipand
im
not
afraid
to
say
these
words
so
many
people
died
so
many
women
were
abused
and
how
many
abominations
there
werei
couldnt
imagine
that
under
our
muchvaunted
authorities
and
if
i
were
to
be
specific
i
would
say
under
the
muchtouted
authorities
in
our
city
of
sumgait
i
couldnt
imagine
that
such
things
could
take
place
when
they
started
breaking
glass
i
told
my
wife
and
son
lets
go
upstairs
we
went
to
our
neighbors
the
grigorians
on
the
fourth
floor
and
in
the
evening
when
those
crowds
started
going
past
again
i
went
outside
once
more
i
stopped
at
the
corner
a
place
called
that
right
next
to
the
bazaar
i
look
and
see
a
crowd
on
the
run
and
there
a
few
yards
from
the
entrance
to
the
bazaar
are
three
respectablelooking
men
of
around
say
years
old
the
crowd
was
running
and
one
of
the
three
waved
with
his
arm
and
pointed
toward
the
bazaar
and
then
the
whole
crowd
as
though
it
were
one
person
wheeled
and
raced
toward
the
bazaar
and
not
a
soul
went
past
those
three
as
though
it
were
off
limits
well
everything
got
all
churned
up
there
was
more
noise
and
the
glass
was
flying
again
we
spent
the
night
at
the
neighbors
my
apartment
was
on
the
first
floor
there
was
really
no
way
to
defend
yourself
there
in
the
morning
i
went
out
to
buy
bread
and
to
see
what
was
happening
in
town
on
the
way
i
saw
someone
hunched
up
still
i
never
found
out
who
it
was
or
what
happened
to
him
there
were
to
people
standing
near
him
i
got
the
bread
and
on
my
way
back
they
had
gathered
around
the
person
who
was
lying
there
hunched
up
sort
of
enclosing
him
because
of
the
way
they
were
standing
you
couldnt
even
see
him
that
was
on
the
morning
of
february
everyone
knows
the
rest
