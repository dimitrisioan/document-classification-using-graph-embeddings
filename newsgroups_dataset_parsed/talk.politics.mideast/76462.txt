QUESTIONS

ISRAELIS
IN
ARTICLE
WRITES
BH
TSIEL
BH
I
WOULD
CONTEND
THAT
THERE
WAS
SHELLING
FROM
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
BORDER
BH
STARTING
FROM
THE
EARLY
CERTAINLY
THE
PLO
DID
SHELL
NORTHERN
BH
ISRAEL
FROM
THE
ARQOUB
REGION
BUT
ISRAEL
DID
MUCH
MORE
SHELLING
BH
DESTROYING
SEVERAL
SOUTH
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
AT
THE
VERY
LEAST
BH
WE
CAN
SAY
THAT
BOTH
SIDES
EXCHANGED
SHELLING
WITH
OCCASIONAL
BH
AERIAL
RAIDS
BY
ISRAEL
ON
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
BH
IN
ANY
CASE
STEVES
CHARACTERIZATION
THAT
THE
INVASION
WAS
ONLY
IN
BH
RESPONSE
TO
YEARS
OF
SHELLING
FROM
LEBANON
IS
FALSE
ISRAEL
HAD
BH
MANY
REASONS
FOR
INVADING
BUT
MAINLY
IT
DID
SO
TO
INSTALL
A
GOVERNMENT
BH
IN
LEBANON
FAVORABLE
TO
ISRAEL
AND
IT
NEARLY
ACHIEVED
THIS
AIM
BH
WITH
THE
ELECTION
OF
BASHEER
EL
GEMAYEL
AND
HIS
BROTHER
AMIN
BH
EL
GEMAYEL
BUT
THE
INTERNAL
SITUATION
IN
LEBANON
WAS
TOO
HARD
BH
TO
CONTROL
AND
PREDICT
SO
ISRAEL
HAD
TO
WITHDRAW
AND
AMIN
EL
GEMAYEL
BH
HAD
TO
ABROGATE
THE
TH
OF
MAY
AGREEMENT
BASIL
I
WAS
ONLY
CORRECTING
STEVES
STATEMENT
THAT
GEURILLAS
WERE
SHELLING
ISRAEL
FROM
THE
GOLAN
WHICH
WAS
ABSURD
THE
FACT
THAT
ISRAEL
DID
MUCH
MORE
SHELLING
WAS
IN
RESPONSE
TO
PALESTINIAN
SHELLING
FROM
LEBANON
ISRAEL
HAS
NO
INTENTION
OF
KEEPING
AN
INCH
OF
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
ISRAEL
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
FIGHT
HIZBULLAH
PLO
FPLP
ETC
AS
LONG
AS
ITS
NORTHERN
BORDER
IS
NOT
QUIET
IF
THE
LEBANESE
ARMY
CAN
CONTROL
THESE
ELEMENTS
THEN
I
THINK
WE
CAN
SEE
GENUINE
PEACE
ON
THE
ISRAELLEBANESE
BORDER
I
REMIND
YOU
THAT
A
COUPLE
THOUSAND
LEBANESE
CROSS
EACH
DAY
INTO
ISRAEL
TO
WORK
AS
FOR
THE
ELECTION
OF
BASHIR
GEMAYEL
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
HE
WAS
FAVORABLE
TO
ISRAEL
IS
THAT
WHY
THE
SYRIANS
KILLED
HIM
HIS
BROTHER
AMIN
WAS
A
SYRIAN
PUPPET
IF
