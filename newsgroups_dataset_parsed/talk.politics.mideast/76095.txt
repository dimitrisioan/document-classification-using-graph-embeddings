I
GUESS
HASAN
FINALLY
REVEALED
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
CLAIM
THAT
ISRAEL
DIVERTED
WATER
FROM
LEBANONHIS
IMAGINATION
ALAN
H
STEIN
ASTEINISRAELNYSERNETORG
MR
WATERHEAD
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
ISRAEL
DIVERTED
LEBANESE
RIVERS
IN
FACT
I
SAID
THAT
ISRAEL
WENT
INTO
SOUTHERN
LEBANON
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
NO
WATER
IS
BEING
USED
ON
THE
LEBANESE
SIDE
SO
THAT
ALL
WATER
WOULD
RUN
INTO
JORDAN
RIVER
WHERE
THERE
ISRAEL
WILL
USE
IT
HEAD
OF
COURSE
POSTING
SOME
HARD
EVIDENCE
OR
FACTS
IS
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
YOU
HAVE
NOT
BOTHERED
TO
SUBSTANTIATE
THIS
IN
ANY
WAY
BASIL
DO
YOU
KNOW
OF
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
WOULD
SUPPORT
THIS
I
AGREE
WITH
SHAI
THERE
ARE
MANY
REFERENCES
TO
ISRAELI
PLANS
ON
THE
LITANI
RIVER
BUT
I
HAVE
YET
TO
FIND
HARD
EVIDENCE
I
HAD
MENTIONED
BEFORE
THAT
THERE
IS
A
REPORT
COMMISSIONED
BY
THE
UN
TO
STUDY
THE
LITANI
RIVER
IT
IS
STILL
IN
DRAFT
FORM
THE
ISRAELI
GOVT
ALSO
COMMISSIONED
A
STUDY
ON
THE
RIVER
THAT
WAS
DONE
BY
DR
BEN
WOLFE
THE
LITANI
STARTS
IN
THE
BEKAA
VALLEY
IN
LEBANON
FLOWS
SOUTHWARD
THEN
WEST
ACROSS
SOUTH
LEBANON
AND
DISCHARGES
INTO
THE
MEDITERRANEAN
NEAR
THE
CITY
OF
TYRE
THERE
ARE
OTHER
RIVERS
SUCH
AS
THE
HASBANI
AND
THE
WAZZANI
THAT
START
IN
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
THAN
JOIN
THE
JORDAN
RIVER
THE
MOST
MENTIONED
PLAN
WAS
ONE
THAT
WOULD
DIVERT
WATER
FROM
THE
LITANI
INTO
THESE
THEN
THE
WATER
WOULD
FLOW
NATURALLY
INTO
THE
LAC
DE
HOULE
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
EVIDENCE
OF
ANY
DIVERSION
STRUCTURE
WHICH
WOULD
NEED
TO
BE
AT
LEAST
KM
LONG
THE
AREA
IS
MOUNTAINOUS
INACCESSIBLE
AND
OCCUPIED
BY
ISRAEL
SO
I
HAVE
NOT
SEEN
ANY
INDEPENDENT
REPORTS
OF
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ANY
DIVERSION
STRUCTURE
THERE
ANOTHER
OFTEN
MENTIONED
DIVERSION
IS
THROUGH
DEEP
WELLS
IT
IS
ALSO
RUMORED
THAT
ISRAE
HAS
M
WELLS
TAPPING
INTO
DEEP
AQUIFERS
AND
DRAWING
WATER
ON
THE
ISRAELI
SIDE
OF
THE
BORDER
IF
SUCH
WELLS
ARE
INDEED
UNDER
USE
THEY
WOULD
BE
COSTLY
TO
OPERATE
HIGH
ENERGY
COSTS
AND
THE
LEBANESE
AND
ISRAELI
GOVT
SHOULD
AGREE
ON
THE
DISTRIBUTION
OF
WATER
FROM
SHARED
AQUIFERS
AS
PART
OF
AN
OVERALL
PEACE
PLAN
AND
THE
BILATERAL
NEGOCIATIONS
ON
REGIONAL
ISSUES
THE
FACT
THAT
WE
HAVE
BEEN
AT
WAR
ALL
THIS
TIME
HAS
LED
TO
THE
CURRENT
STATE
OF
AFFAIRS
WHERE
WITHDRAWALS
FROM
SUCH
AQUIFERS
IS
COMPLETELY
