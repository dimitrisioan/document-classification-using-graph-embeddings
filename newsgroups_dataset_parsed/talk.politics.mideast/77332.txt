writes
a
perfect
example
is
the
outcry
over
the
temporary
removal
of
men
who
advocated
murdering
jews
and
destroying
the
state
of
israel
compared
to
the
deafening
silence
over
the
abusive
treatment
of
jews
in
arab
countries
during
the
past
years
never
mind
the
fact
that
these
people
were
denied
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
and
israel
was
supposed
to
uphold
western
values
eh
i
doubt
if
the
nonjewish
world
is
even
capable
of
having
any
compassion
towards
jews
as
antisemitism
is
so
ancient
and
so
basic
to
both
christianity
and
islam
check
your
facts
before
bashing
islam
again
while
there
may
be
muslim
antisemites
this
is
no
way
a
tenet
of
the
religion
saying
antisemitism
is
basic
to
islam
is
implicating
the
entire
muslim
world
based
on
a
selective
sampling
of
a
few
people
and
it
flies
in
the
face
of
what
islam
teaches
peace

what
makes
