WELL
YOU
SHOULD
HAVE
NOTED
THAT
I
WAS
CHEERING
AN
ATTACK
ON
AN
ISRAELI
PATROL
INSIDE
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
WHILE
I
WAS
CONDEMNING
THE
RETALIATORY
SHELLING
OF
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
BY
ISRAELI
AND
ISRAELIBACKED
FORCES
MY
TEAM
YOU
SEE
WAS
PLAYING
FAIR
WHILE
THE
OPPOSING
TEAM
WAS
REARRANGING
THE
FACES
OF
THE
SPECTATORS
IN
MY
TEAMS
VIEWING
STANDS
SO
TO
SPEAK
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
TRY
TO
FIND
MORE
SOURCES
OF
NEWS
ABOUT
WHAT
GOES
ON
IN
LEBANON
AND
TRY
TO
SEE
THROUGH
THE
PROPAGANDA
THERE
ARE
NO
A
PRIORI
BLACK
AND
WHITE
HATS
BUT
ONE
SURE
WONDERS
HOW
THE
IDF
CAN
BOMBARD
VILLAGES
IN
RETALIATION
TO
PINPOINT
ATTACKS
ON
ITS
SOLDIERS
IN
LEBANON
AND
THEN
CALL
THE
LEBANESE
TERRORISTS
IF
THE
ATTACK
WAS
JUSTIFIED
OR
NOT
IS
AT
LEAST
DEBATABLE
BUT
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
ISSUE
THE
ISSUE
IS
THAT
YOU
WERE
CHEERING
DEATH
DORIN
DORIN
OF
ALL
THE
CRITICISM
OF
MY
POST
EXPRESSED
ON
TPM
THIS
ONE
I
ACCEPT
I
REGRET
THAT
ASPECT
OF
MY
POST
IT
IS
MY
HOPE
THAT
THE
OCCUPATION
WILL
END
AND
THE
ACCOMPANYING
LOSS
OF
LIFE
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THAT
STIFF
RESISTANCE
CAN
HELP
TO
ACHIEVE
THAT
END
DESPITE
WHAT
SOME
HAVE
SAID
ON
TPM
I
THINK
THAT
THERE
IS
A
POINT
WHEN
LOSSES
ARE
UNACCEPTABLE
THE
STRATEGY
DROVE
US
TROOPS
OUT
OF
LEBANON
AT
LEAST
