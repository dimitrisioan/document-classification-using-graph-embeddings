ALAN
STEIN
WRITES
THE
GOLAN
HEIGHTS
IS
A
SERIOUS
SECURITY
PROBLEM
AND
ISRAEL
OBVIOUSLY
WILL
HAVE
TO
KEEP
PART
OF
IT
AND
GIVE
UP
PART
OF
IT
ONE
SHOULD
REMEMBER
THAT
THE
GOLAN
HEIGHTS
HAD
BEEN
PART
OF
THE
AREA
THAT
WAS
TO
BE
IN
BRITAINS
PALESTINE
MANDATE
SLATED
TO
BECOME
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
STATE
UNTIL
BRITAIN
TRADED
IT
TO
FRANCE
FOR
OTHER
CONSIDERATIONS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IT
IS
AN
HISTORICAL
ACCIDENT
THAT
IT
WAS
EVER
PART
OF
SYRIA
THE
PALESTINE
MANDATE
HAD
NO
BORDERS
BEFORE
THE
BORDERS
WERE
NEGOTIATED
AND
DRAWN
THE
MOST
THE
GOLAN
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
IS
ON
THE
LIST
OF
WHAT
TERRITORIES
BRITIAN
WOULD
HAVE
LIKED
TO
SEE
IN
THE
PALESTINE
MANDATE
UNTIL
THE
MANDATES
CAME
INTO
EXISTANCE
THERE
WERE
NO
DEFINED
BOUNDARIES
BETWEEN
ANY
OF
THE
VARIOUS
TERRITORIES
IN
THE
REGION
IF
YOU
HAVE
A

FOR
ANY
OF
THESE
