HENRIK
LET
ME
CLEARIFY
MR
TURKISH
HENRIK
ARMENIA
IS
NOT
GETTING
ITCHY
SHE
IS
SIMPLY
LETTING
THE
WORLD
KNOW
HENRIK
THAT
SHE
WILL
NO
LONGER
SIT
THERE
QUIET
AND
LET
TURKS
GET
AWAY
WITH
HENRIK
THEIR
FAMOUS
TRICKS
ARMENIANS
DO
REMEMBER
OF
THE
TURKISH
INVASION
HENRIK
OF
THE
GREEK
ISLAND
OF
CYPRESS
WHILE
THE
WORLD
SIMPLY
WATCHED
ONUR
YALCIN
IT
IS
MORE
APPROPRIATE
TO
ADDRESS
NETTERS
WITH
THEIR
NAMES
AS
ONUR
YALCIN
THEY
APPEAR
IN
THEIR
SIGNATURES
I
FAILED
TO
DO
SO
SINCE
YOU
DID
ONUR
YALCIN
NOT
BOTHER
TO
SIGN
YOUR
POSTING
NOT
ONLY
BECAUSE
IT
IS
THE
ONUR
YALCIN
POLITE
THING
TO
DO
BUT
ALSO
TO
AVOID
ADDRESSING
LADIES
WITH
ONUR
YALCIN
MR
AS
YOU
HAVE
DONE
FINE
PLEASE
ACCEPT
MY
OPOLOGY
ONUR
YALCIN
SECONDLY
THE
ISLAND
OF
WHICH
THE
NAME
IS
MORE
CORRECTLY
SPELLED
ONUR
YALCIN
AS
CYPRUS
HAS
NEVER
BEEN
GREEK
BUT
RATHER
IT
HAS
BEEN
HOME
TO
ONUR
YALCIN
A
BICOMMUNAL
SOCIETY
FORMED
OF
GREEKS
AND
TURKS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
ONUR
YALCIN
YOU
KNOW
AS
LITTLE
ABOUT
THE
HISTORY
AND
THE
DEMOGRAPHY
OF
THE
ONUR
YALCIN
ISLAND
AS
YOU
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
ESSENCE
OF
TURKEYS
ONUR
YALCIN
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
TO
IT
UNDER
INTERNATIONAL
AGREEMENTS
BICOMMUNAL
SOCIETY
THEN
WHY
DID
NOT
GREECE
INVADE
CYPRUS
ONUR
YALCIN
BE
THAT
AS
IT
MAY
AN
ANALOGY
BETWEEN
AN
ACT
OF
OCCUPATION
IN
ONUR
YALCIN
HISTORY
AND
WHAT
IS
GOING
ON
TODAY
ON
AZERBAIJANI
LAND
CAN
ONLY
ONUR
YALCIN
BE
DRAWN
WITH
THE
EXPANSIONIST
POLICY
THAT
ARMENIA
IS
NOW
PURSUING
BUCH
OF
CRAP
AND
YOU
KNOW
IT
NAGARNOKARABAGH
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
PART
OF
ARMENIA
AND
IT
WAS
STALIN
WHO
GAVE
IT
TO
THE
AZERIS
GO
BACK
AND
REVIEW
THE
HISTORY
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
NAGARNOKARABAGH
ARE
SIMPLY
DEFENDING
THEIR
RIGHTS
TO
KEEP
THEIR
HOMELAND
AND
IT
IS
THE
AZERIS
THAT
ARE
INVADING
THEIR
TERITORY
ONUR
YALCIN
BUT
I
COULD
AGREE
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
FOR
US
TO
ISSUE
DIAGNOSES
TO
ONUR
YALCIN
THE
POLITICAL
CONDUCT
OF
COUNTRIES
AND
PROMULGATE
THEM
IN
SUCH
ONUR
YALCIN
TERMINOLOGY
AS
ITCHYBITCHY
I
WAS
NOT
THE
ONE
THAT
STATED
IT
HOWEVER
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
WILL
FORCE
A
TURKISH
AIRPLANE
TO
LAND
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
SEARCHING
FOR
ARMS
SIMILAR
TO
THE
ONE
THAT
HAPPENED
LAST
SUMMER
TURKEY
SEARCHED
AN
AMERICAN
PLANE
CARRYING
HUMANITARIAN
AID
BOUND
TO
ARMENIA
