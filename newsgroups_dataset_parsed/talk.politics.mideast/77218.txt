THE

OF
ANOTHER

AND

EARLIER
KHALED
SHEIKH
ALI
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
ISLAMIC
JIHAD
DIED
AT
THE
SHABAK
INSTALLATION
IN
GAZA
PRISON
THE
TWO
SHABAK
INTERROGATORS
WHO
WERE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
HIS
DEATH
WERE
PUT
ON
TRIAL
IN
SEPTEMBER
THE
SUPREME
COURT
REJECTED
THEIR
APPEAL
AND
SENTENCED
THEM
TO
MONTHS
IN
PRISON
AS
FAR
AS
IS
KNOWN
THIS
WAS
THE
FIRST
TIME
IN
ISRAELS
HISTORY
THAT
SHABAK
OPERATIVES
WERE
SENT
TO
PRISON
THE
SUPREME
COURT
UNANIMOUSLY
REJECTED
THE
WARNING
BY
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
SHABAK
THAT
THE
SENTENCE
WILL
BE
DETRIMENTAL
THE
EFFECTIVENESS
OF
OTHER
INTERROGATORS
THE
JUDGES
IN
THE
CASE
WERE
BARAK
GOLDBERG
AND
MATZA
WHEN
THEY
REALIZED
THAT
THEY
WERE
ON
THEIR
OWN
THE
INTERROGATORS
AGREED
TO
TALK
DEPUTY
STATE
ATTORNEY
RACHEL
SUKKARSP
WAS
PLACED
IN
CHARGE
OF
INVESTIGATING
THE
AFFAIR
SHE
QUESTIONED
THE
DIRECTORS
OF
ALL
SHABAK
DIVISIONS
SHE
INVESTIGATED
ONLY
THE
MATTER
OF
THE
DEATH
IN
GAZA
PRISON
SHE
DISCOVERED
THAT
NOT
ONLY
TORTURE
BUT
ALSO
THE
CULTURE
OF
LIES
WHICH
JUDGE
LANDAU
HAD
DESCRIBED
IN
HIS
REPORT
OF
TWO
YEARS
BEFORE
WERE
STILL
VERY
MUCH
IN
EXISTENCE
NOTHING
HAD
CHANGED
THE
REPORT
WAS
CLASSIFIED
AND
WAS
SEEN
BY
ONLY
SOME
TEN
PEOPLE
AMONG
THEM
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
THE
PEOPLE
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
JUDICIAL
SYSTEM
AND
JUDGE
LANDAU
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
SHABAK
CLAIMED
THAT
HE
DID
NOT
KNOW
AFTER
ALL
THEY
WERE
DEALING
ONLY
WITH
A
SINGLE
JAIL
AND
WITH
LOW
RANKING
PEOPLE
THE
SYSTEM
BIT
THE
BULLET
AND
ACCEPTED
THE
EXPLANATION
ONE
OF
SHABAKS
HIGHRANKING
OFFICIALS
WAS
TRANSFERED
FROM
HIS
VERY
HIGH
POSITION
TO
A
LESS
HIGH
POSITION
THE
CULTURE
OF
LIES
REFERRED
TO
ABOVE
IS
THE
SHABAK
INTERROGATORS
POLICY
OF
LYING
IN
COURT
WHEN
DENYING
DETAINEES
CLAIMS
THAT
THEY
WERE
TORTURED
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
INTERROGATION
THE
LANDAU
COMMISSION
SOUGHT
TO
CORRECT
THIS
PROBLEM
BY
LEGALIZING
A
LIST
OF
TORTURE
METHODS
THUS
ELIMINATING
THE
FEAR
THAT
A
DETAINEE
MIGHT
BE
RELEASED
IF
THOSE
METHODS
WERE
USED
TO
EXTRACT
A
CONFESSION
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
NEED
TO
LIE
STILL
PERSISTS
WOULD
SEEM
TO
INDICATE
THAT
SHABAK
IS
NOT
