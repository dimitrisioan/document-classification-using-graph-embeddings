FOR
GAZA
THE
HONEST
ANSWER
TO
YOUR
QUESTION
ABOUT
ARABS
WHO
WERE
EXPELLED
FROM
JAFFA
ANDOR
WHO
FLED
JAFFA
OR
ANYWHERE
ELSE
IN
ISRAEL
HAVING
THE
RIGHT
TO
RETURN
IS
YES
UNFORTUNATELY
THEY
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
RETURN
THEY
MAY
APPLY
FOR
CITIZENSHIP
LIKE
ANY
OTHER
NONISRAELI

THEN
GO

A
QUESTION
AND
ANSWER
FOR
YOU
CAN
THE
JEWS
WHO
WERE
BORN
AND
RAISED
IN
HEBRON
OR
THEIR
DESCENDANTS
GO
BACK
TO
THEIR
HOMES
IN
HEBRON
THE
ANSWER
IS
ABSOLUTELY
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
ALMOST
ALL
MURDERED
BY
THEIR
ARAB
NEIGHBORS
THE
PALESTINIANS
NOW
DO
I
THINK
THE
ARABS
SHOULD
BE
ALLOWED
TO
EVEN
VISIT
THEIR
HOMES
IN
JAFFA
HELL
NO
BRING
BACK
THE
JEWS
OF
HEBRON
PETAH
TIKVA
JERUSALEM
SAFED
ETC
THEN
PERHAPS
I
WOULD
BE
IN
FAVOR
OF
ARABS
RETURNING
TO
THEIR
JAFFA
HOMES
HOWEVER
SEEING
AS
NO
ARAB
HAS
YET
BEEN
ABLE
TO
BRING
PEOPLE
BACK
FROM
THE
DEAD
ID
SAY
THATS
OUT
WITH
ALL
THE
HOPE
IN
THE
WORLD
