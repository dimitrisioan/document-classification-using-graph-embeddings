TIM
CLOCK
WRITES
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
WHEN
GUERILLAS
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ISRAEL
SHOULD
TOTALLY
BACK
DOWN
SOTHE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
ATTACKING
ANOTHER
IS
TO
USE
AN
INNOCENT
AS
A
SHIELD
AND
HOPE
THAT
THE
OTHER
RESPECTS
INNOCENT
LIVES
TELL
ME
TIM
WHAT
ARE
THESE
GUERILLAS
DOING
WRONG
ASSUMING
THAT
THEY
ARE
USING
CIVILIANS
FOR
COVER
ARE
THEY
NOT
KILLING
SOLDIERS
IN
THEIR
COUNTRY
IF
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
IS
TO
PREVENT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
IS
IT
NOT
WORKING
WHY
IS
IT
FURTHER
NECCESSARY
FOR
ISRAELI
GUNS
TO
POUND
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
WHY
NOT
JUST
KILL
THOSE
WHO
TRY
TO
INFILTRATE
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
YOU
SEE
THERE
IS
MORE
TO
THE
SHELLING
OF
THE
VILLAGES
IT
IS
CALLED
RETALIATION
GETTING
BACK
GETTING
EVEN
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
SHELL
THE
VILLAGES
THE
LEAST
IT
SHOWS
IS
A
RECKLESS
DISREGARD
BY
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
FOR
THE
LIVES
OF
CIVILIANS
IF
YOU
RECALL
A
SUBJECT
WAS
RAISED
SOME
WEEKS
AGO
THAT
TOUCHED
UPON
THIS
WHEN
SOMEONE
CLAIMED
THAT
GUERILLAS
WERE
MANIFESTATIONS
OF
POPULAR
SENTIMENT
THE
TOPIC
AROSEWHEN
DOES
A
CIVILIAN
STOP
BECOMING
A
CIVILIAN
IF
HE
HOUSES
AND
SHELTERS
GUERILLAS
OF
HIS
OWN
FREE
WILL
AIDING
THEM
HAS
HE
VIOLATED
HIS
CIVILIAN
STATUS
WHAT
SO
THE
WHOLE
BIT
ABOUT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
NEIGHBORING
ARAB
STATES
CAN
START
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
WHILE
I
ALSO
HOPE
FOR
THIS
TO
HAPPEN
IT
WILL
ONLY
OCCUR
WHEN
ARAB
STATES
SHOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
PREPARED
TO
TAKE
ON
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
THE
DUTY
TO
STOP
GUERILLA
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
THEIR
SOIL
THEY
HAVE
TO
PROVE
IT
OR
PROVIDE
SOME
GUARATEES
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
ISRAEL
IS
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
THEIR
WORD
NOT
WITH
THEIR
PAST
ATTITUDE
OF
TOLERANCE
TOWARDS
ANTIISRAEL
GUERILLAS
INRESIDENCE
IF
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
OTHERS
THEN
IMHO
IT
HAS
NO
BUSINESS
WASTING
OTHERS
TIME
COMING
TO
THE
PEACE
TALKS
BUT
DONT
YOU
SEE
THAT
THE
SAME
STATEMENT
CAN
BE
MADE
BOTH
WAYS
IF
LEBANON
WAS
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
THEN
IT
SHOULD
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
ISRAEL
THAT
THE
ATTACKS
WERE
THE
CAUSE
FOR
WAR
AND
DISARMING
THE
HIZBOLLAH
WILL
REMOVE
THE
CAUSE
FOR
ITS
CONTINUED
OCCUPANCY
AFTERALL
ISRAEL
HAS
ALREADY
STAGED
TWO
PARTS
OF
THE
WITHDRAWAL
FROM
AREAS
IT
OCCUPIED
IN
LEBANON
DURING
SLG
TIM
YOU
ARE
IGNORING
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PALESTINIANS
IN
LEBANON
HAVE
BEEN
DISARMED
HEZBOLLAH
REMAINS
THE
ONLY
INDEPENDENT
MILITIA
HEZBOLLAH
DOES
NOT
ATTACK
ISRAEL
EXCEPT
AT
A
FEW
TIMES
SUCH
AS
WHEN
THE
IDF
BURNED
UP
SHEIKH
MOSAVI
HIS
WIFE
AND
YOUNG
SON
OF
COURSE
IF
ISRAEL
WOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
LEBANON
AND
STOP
ASSASSINATING
PEOPLE
AND
SHELLING
VILLAGES
THEY
WOULDNT
MAKE
THE
LEBANESE
SO
MAD
AS
TO
DO
THAT
FURTHERMORE
WITH
HEZBOLLAH
SUBSEQUENTLY
DISARMED
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
POSSIBLE
THAT
IS
NOT
EXACTLY
TRUE
THE
HIZBOLLAH
AND
THEIR
AFFILIATED
GROUPS
HAVE
MADE
SEVERAL
ATTEMPTS
TO
INFILTRATE
THE
BORDER
OF
ISRAEL
IT
HAS
NOT
WITHOUT
THE
SUPPORT
AND
ACTIVE
INVOLVEMENT
OF
SYRIA
LEBANON
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ACCOMPLISH
ALL
THAT
HAS
OCCURRED
ONCE
SYRIA
LEAVES
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
LEBANON
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
RETAIN
CONTROL
IF
SYRIA
STAYS
THAY
MAY
BE
EVEN
MORE
DANGEROUS
FOR
ISRAEL
TIM
WHEN
IS
THE
LAST
TIME
THAT
YOU
RECALL
ANY
TROUBLE
ON
THE
SYRIAN
BORDER
NOT
LATELY
EH
ISRAEL
KNOWS
VERY
WELL
THAT
THE
SYRIANS
ARE
ABLE
TO
RESTRAIN
ALL
WHO
WOULD
USE
TERRITORY
UNDER
THEIR
CONTROL
TO
ATTACK
ISRAEL
WHILE
LEBANON
WOULD
BE
BETTER
OFF
WITH
SYRIA
AND
ISRAEL
OUT
OF
ITS
BORDERS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
SYRIAN
TROOPS
IN
LEBANON
HAS
MEANT
A
SHARP
DECREASE
IN
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAELI
TERRITORY
NOT
ON
ISRAELI
TROOPS
IN
LEBANON
HOWEVER
PLEASE
NOTE
THE
DISTINCTION
IN
THE
PAST
TWO
YEARS
TRUE
BUT
THE
SYRIANS
DID
ALLOW
UNTIL
AT
LEAST
GUERILLAS
TO
OPERATE
IN
THE
AREAS
THAT
WERE
UNDER
THEIR
CONTROL
PROVIDED
THAT
THOSE
GUERILLAS
WERE
ATTACKING
ISRAELI
LINES
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
SYRIA
IS
ALSO
NOT
AS
STABLE
A
PARTNER
FOR
LONG
TERM
PEACE
AS
OTHERS

THE
