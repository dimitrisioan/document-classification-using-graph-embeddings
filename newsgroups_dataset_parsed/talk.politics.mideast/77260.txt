RE
EUROPE
VS
MUSLIM
BOSNIANS
IN
ARTICLE
GOLCHOWYALCHEMYCHEMUTORONTOCA
GERALD
OLCHOWY
WRITES
IT
IS
EASY
FOR
SEN
BIDEN
TO
SAY
THAT
WHEN
THERE
ARE
NO
US
TROOPS
IN
ZEPA
OR
SREBINICA
OR
SAREJEVO
THE
EXISTING
UN
POLICY
MAY
CERTAINING
BE
WRONG
BUT
THE
US
WANTS
TO
DICTATE
POLICY
AND
MAKE
EUROPE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
THAT
POLICY
BOSNIA
IS
A
BIG
ENOUGH
PROBLEM
FOR
THE
US
TO
PREACH
ABOUT
WHAT
OTHER
COUNTRIES
SHOULD
BE
DOING
WITH
THEIR
FORCESBUT
ITS
FORCES
ARE
SAFELY
TUCKED
AWAY
AT
HOME
IN
THE
US
GERALD
LOOK
NOBODY
ASKED
THOSE
COUNTRIES
ABOUT
THEIR
UN
FORCES
TO
BE
ON
THE
GROUND
THEY
CAN
TAKE
THEIR
FORCES
WHICH
ARE
INCOMPONENT
AND
INEFFECTIVE
AT
THE
FIRST
PLACE
AND
LET
WHOEVER
ARE
WILLING
TO
DO
THE
JOB
WHAT
IT
TAKES
HOW
ANYONE
CAN
DEFEND
THIS
STINKING
UN
FORCE
ON
THE
GROUND
WHO
LET
THE
BOSNNIAN
PM
YANKED
OUT
FROM
THE
UN
VEHICLE
AND
BEING
SHOT
BY
THE
SERBIAN
MILITARY
HOW
ANYONE
CAN
DEFEND
THIS
UN
FORCE
WHO
ARE
JUST
WATCHING
THE
SHELLING
ON
CITIES
AND
TOWNS
EVERYDAY
HOW
ANYONE
CAN
DEFEND
AND
SAY
THOSE
STINKING
UN
FORCES
BEING
EFFECTIVE
WHEN
BOSNIAN
HAD
ALMOST
CHILDREN
CASUALTIES
BETWEEN
AGE
GROUPS
I
THINK
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
CURRENT
UN
FORCES
TO
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
IS
JUST
AN
INSULT
TO
THEIR
CASUALTIES
I
THINK
SENATOR
BIDEN
SAID
IT
ALL
WHAT
HAS
TO
BE
SAID
ON
THIS
ISSUE
EUROPE
IS
A
SAD
PLACE
TO
CRITICIZE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IN
ANYWHERE
IN
THIS
WORLD
LIKE
BIDEN
SAID
THEY
ARE
THE
BIGOTS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
CULTURAL
DIFFERENCE
AND
MINORTY
CLOSER
TO
THEIR
HOME
BECAUSE
THEY
GET
RID
OF
THEIR
MINORITIES
LONG
LONG
TIME
AGO
STARTING
IN
CENTURIES
AND
THEY
LET
ADOLPH
TO
TAKE
CARE
OF
THE
REST
IN
CENTURY
BUT
HE
WAS
MUCH
MORE
NAUGHTY
THAN
THEY
EXPECTED
BECAUSE
HE
DARED
TO
STEP
MANY
TOES
SO
WHY
SPOIL
THE
GOOD
THING
NOW
WHEN
SERBS
DOING
TODAY
WHAT
THEY
WERE
THINKING
THE
SAME
YESTERDAY
