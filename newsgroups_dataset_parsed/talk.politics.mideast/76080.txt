WRITES
I
SAID
THE
FIXATION
ON
BOSNIA
IS
DUE
TO
IT
BEING
IN
A
EUROPEAN
COUNTRY
RATHER
THAN
THE
THIRD
WORLD
KEN
SAYS
INTERVENTION
IN
SOMALIA
IS
A
COUNTEREXAMPLE
I
AM
A
STAUNCH
REPUBLICAN
BTW
THE
IRONY
OF
ARGUING
AGAINST
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
WITH
ARGUMENTS
BASED
ON
VIETNAM
HAS
NOT
ESCAPED
ME
I
WAS
OPPOSED
TO
US
INTERVENTION
IN
SOMALIA
FOR
THE
SAME
REASONS
ALTHOUGH
CLEARLY
IT
WAS
NOT
NEARLY
AS
RISKY
BASED
ON
THE
SAME
REASONS
YOU
MEAN
YOU
WERE
OPPOSED
TO
US
INTERVENTION
IN
SOMALIA
BECAUSE
SINCE
SOMALIA
IS
A
EUROPEAN
COUNTRY
INSTEAD
OF
THE
THIRD
WORLD
THE
DESIRE
TO
HELP
SOMALIA
IS
RACIST
I
DONT
THINK
THIS
SAME
REASON
APPLIES
TO
SOMALIA
AT
ALL
NO
YOU
HAVE
COMPLETELY
MISUNDERSTOOD
I
WAS
OPPOSED
TO
INTERVENTION
IN
SOMALIA
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
I
AM
OPPOSED
TO
INTERVENTION
IN
BOSNIA
THERE
IS
NO
SECURITY
INTEREST
OF
THE
UNITED
STATES
THERE
WHICH
JUSTIFIES
RISKING
THE
LIVES
OF
AMERICAN
SERVICEMEN
AND
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
CRISES
IN
THE
WORLD
FOR
US
TO
TAKE
ON
ALL
OF
THEM
IN
THE
CASE
OF
BOSNIA
THE
RISKS
ARE
OBVIOUSLY
MUCH
GREATER
AND
THERE
ARE
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
A
MUCH
BETTER
POSITION
AND
WITH
FAR
BETTER
REASONS
TO
TAKE
ACTION
THAN
THE
US
THE
WHOLE
POINT
IS
THAT
SOMALIA
IS
A
THIRD
WORLD
COUNTRY
AND
WE
WERE
MORE
WILLING
TO
SEND
TROOPS
THERE
THAN
TO
BOSNIAEXACTLY
THE
OPPOSITE
OF
WHAT
THE
FIXATION
ON
EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES
THEORY
WOULD
PREDICT
SIMILARLY
THE
DESIRE
TO
HELP
MUSLIMS
BEING
FOUGHT
BY
CHRISTIANS
IS
ALSO
EXACTLY
THE
OPPOSITE
OF
WHAT
THAT
THEORY
PREDICTS
YOU
CONTINUE
TO
MISUNDERSTAND
I
DID
NOT
SAY
THE
REASON
WHY
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
INTERVENE
IS
BECAUSE
OF
RACIST
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
OVERLY
FOND
OF
USING
THIS
WORD
BTW
I
SAID
THE
PHENOMENON
WAS
RACERELATED
WHICH
IS
NOT
THE
SAME
AS
RACIST
PERHAPS
THIS
DISTINCTION
IS
TOO
SUBTLE
FOR
YOU
TO
GRASP
MOTIVES
I
SAID
THE
ATTENTION
AND
OUTRAGE
AT
THE
ENTIRE
YUGOSLAVIAN
SITUATION
WAS
A
RESULT
OF
IT
BEING
CLOSER
TO
HOME
HAPPENING
TO
PEOPLE
WE
CAN
IDENTIFY
WITH
AND
RELENTLESSLY
HARPED
ON
BY
THE
MEDIA
I
NEVER
SAID
ANYTHING
ABOUT
WHICH
SIDE
WOULD
BE
PREFERRED
WHICH
HAS
A
LOT
MORE
TO
DO
WITH
THE
PRESENTATION
OF
THE
CONFLICT
THAN
ANY
PSYCHOLOGICAL
FACTORS
I
THINK
THERE
IS
NO
DOUBT
THAT
DESPITE
THE
FACT
WE
INTERVENED
IN
SOMALIA
THE
LEVEL
OF
ATTENTION
DEVOTED
TO
THERE
WAS
CONSIDERABLY
LESS
THAN
WHAT
IS
DEVOTED
TO
BOSNIA
IF
THE
NEWSPAPERS
AND
TV
NEWS
I
SEE
ARE
ANY
GUIDE
DAVE
