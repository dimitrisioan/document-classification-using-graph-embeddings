THE
PROBLEM
IF
TRANSFFERING
US
GOVERNMENT
FILES
ABOUT
YIGAL
ARENS
AND
SOME
OTHER
SIMILAR
PERSONS
DOES
OR
DOES
NOT
VIOLATE
A
FEDERAL
OR
A
LOCAL
AMERICAN
LAW
SEEMED
TO
BELONG
TO
SOME
LOCAL
AMERICAN

FORUM
NOT
TO
THIS
FORUM
THE
READERS
OF
THIS
FORUM
SEEMED
TO
BE
MORE
INTERESTED
IN
THE
CONTENTS
OF
THOSE
FILES
SO
IT
WILL
BE
NICE
IF
YIGAL
WILL
TELL
US
WHY
DO
AMERICAN
AUTHORITIES
CONSIDER
YIGAL
ARENS
TO
BE
DANGEROUS
IM
NOT
AWARE
THAT
THE
US
GOVERNMENT
CONSIDERS
ME
DANGEROUS
IN
ANY
CASE
THAT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
CURRENT
CASE
THE
CLAIM
AGAINST
THE
ADL
IS
THAT
IT
ILLEGALLY
OBTAINED
AND
DISSEMINATED
INFORMATION
THAT
WAS
GATHERED
BY
STATE
ANDOR
FEDERAL
AGENCIES
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
THEIR
STANDARD
INTERACTION
WITH
CITIZENS
SUCH
AS
MYSELF
BY
THAT
I
REFER
TO
THINGS
SUCH
AS
ADDRESS
AND
PHONE
NUMBER
VEHICLE
REGISTRATION
AND
LICENSE
INFORMATION
PHOTOGRAPHS
ETC
WHY
DOES
THE
ADL
HAVE
AN
INTEREST
IN
THAT
PERSON
YOU
SHOULD
ASK
THE
ADL
IF
YOU
WANT
AN
AUTHORITATIVE
ANSWER
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
THEY
COLLECTED
INFORMATION
ON
ANYONE
WHO
DID
OR
MIGHT
ENGAGE
IN
POLITICAL
CRITICISM
OF
ISRAEL
I
FURTHER
BELIEVE
THAT
THEY
DID
THIS
AS
AGENTS
OF
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
OR
AT
LEAST
IN
AGREEMENT
WITH
THEM
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
THE
INFORMATION
COLLECTED
BY
THE
ADL
WAS
PASSED
ON
TO
ISRAELI
OFFICIALS
IN
SOME
CASES
IT
WAS
USED
TO
INFLUENCE
OR
ATTEMPT
TO
INFLUENCE
PEOPLES
ACCESS
TO
JOBS
OR
PUBLIC
FORUMS
THESE
MATTERS
WILL
BE
BROUGHT
OUT
AS
THE
