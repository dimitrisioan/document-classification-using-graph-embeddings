what
gives
isreal
the
right
to
keep
jeruseleum
it
is
the
home
of
the
muslim
a
s
well
as
jewish
religion
among
others
israel
has
a
right
to
keep
jerusalem
for
many
reasons
they
include
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
citizens
are
israeli
the
fact
that
israel
maintains
religious
freedom
for
all
people
and
the
historical
connection
of
judaism
to
jerusalem
when
jerusalem
was
devided
by
a
jordanian
invasion
in
the
cease
fire
agreement
included
the
right
of
individuals
to
visit
religious
shrines
this
cease
fire
agreement
was
violated
by
jordan
who
did
not
allow
jews
to
visit
holy
sites
under
their
control
the
jordanians
also
bulldozed
every
synagoge
in
the
city
they
turned
a
jewish
cemetary
into
a
hotel
and
used
the
gravestones
in
their
latrines
israel
has
allowed
individuals
of
all
religions
into
jerusalem
protected
holy
sites
and
demonstrated
its
fitness
to
control
the
city
also
i
should
point
out
that
islam
is
not
centered
in
jerusalem
but
has
holy
sites
there
the
home
of
islam
is
mecca
where
all
muslims
should
make
a
pilgramage
the
hajj
unlike
israeli
jerusalem
jews
and
christians
are
not
allowed
in
saudi
mecca
