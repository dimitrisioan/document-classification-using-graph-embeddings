besides
theres
no
case
that
can
be
made
for
us
military
involvement
there
that
doesnt
apply
equally
well
to
say
liberia
angola
or
it
appears
with
the
khmer
rouges
new
campaign
cambodia
nonwhites
dont
count
hmmsome
might
say
kuwaitis
are
nonwhite
ooops
i
forgot
kuwaitis
are
oil
rich
loaded
with
petrodollars
etc
so
they
dont
count
and
lets
not
forget
somalia
which
is
about
as
far
from
white
as
it
gets
and
why
are
we
in
somalia
when
right
across
the
gulf
of
aden
are
some
of
the
wealthiest
arab
nations
on
the
planet
why
does
the
us
always
become
the
point
man
for
this
stuff
i
dont
mind
us
helping
out
but
what
invariably
happens
is
that
everybody
expects
us
to
do
most
of
the
work
and
take
most
of
the
risks
even
when
these
events
are
occuring
in
other
peoples
back
yards
and
they
have
the
resources
to
deal
with
them
quite
well
thank
you
i
mean
its
not
like
either
serbia
or
somalia
represent
some
overwhelming
military
force
that
their
neighbors
cant
handle
nor
are
the
logistics
a
big
deal
its
a
lot
bigger
logistical
challenge
to
get
troops
and
supplies
from
new
york
to
somalia
than
from
saudi
arabia
harder
to
go
from
texas
to
serbia
than
turkey
or
austria
to
serbia
