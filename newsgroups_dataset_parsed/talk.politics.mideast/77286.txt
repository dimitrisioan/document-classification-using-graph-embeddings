just
after

many

many

please
dont
be
offended
at
this
question
who
are
the
muslims
in
the
bosnian
context
i
know
that
a
moslemmuslim
is
a
believer
in
islam
islam
is
a
religion
and
it
is
practised
in
many
parts
of
the
world
but
it
is
not
yes
definitely
not
an
ethinic
group
ok
so
these
bosnian
muslims
who
are
they
to
which
ethnic
group
do
they
belong
what
languages
do
they
speak
do
they
have
a
different
language
from
that
of
the
serbs
or
croats
the
way
the
western
press
use
the
word
muslim
in
this
bosnian
debacle
has
kept
me
wondering
when
the
meaning
of
muslimmoslem
i
knew
from
childhood
was
changed
in
the
dictionary
this
is
just
a
question
no
flames
intended
oguocha
it
is
indeed
different
usage
of
the
word
muslim
in
bosnia
it
is
more
or
less
used
as
an
ethnic
term
not
as
religious
one
there
are
people
in
bosnia
who
refer
to
themselves
as
christian
bosnian
muslims
if
you
can
make
sense
of
that
bosnian
serbs
and
bosnian
muslims
have
the
same
language
bosnian
muslims
are
mainly
beleivers
of
islam
i
got
this
from
bosnian
muslim
friend
of
mine
who
goes
to
university
of
texas
in
austin
