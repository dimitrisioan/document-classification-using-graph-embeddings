actually
if
can
remember
correctly
was
it
not
reported
and
even
on
camera
some
time
during
the
israeli
invasion
of
lebanon
or
when
the
itifada
began
that
cnn
caught
regular
uniformed
israeli
soldiers
breaking
the
arms
of
some
arab
youngsters
in
a
very
professional
and
brutal
manner
someone
please
give
full
details
if
they
can
remember
so
was
it
on
cnn
or
not
this
is
one
of
the
few
occassions
on
which
such
a
scene
has
been
transmitted
to
the
west
and
in
the
usa
it
caused
uproar
and
was
one
of
the
factors
that
has
significantly
changed
the
preception
of
the
israeli
armys
role
in
the
mideast
so
there
is
proof
for
you
what
proof
you
said
above
was
it
not
reported
and
someone
please
give
full
details
if
they
can
remember
hear
say
is
not
proof
it
is
obvious
that
is
a
systematic
policy
of
the
israelis
which
must
be
occurring
on
a
massive
scale
behind
the
scenes
yes
like
the
or
more
palestinians
brutally
murdered
by
their
brothers
