WRITES
BTW
DOES
THE
LITANI
RIVER
NOT
FLOW
WEST
AND
NOT
SOUTH
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
WATERS
STAY
ENTIRELY
WITHIN
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
AND
SO
WHAT
HASAN
SAYS
ABOUT
THE
JORDAN
RIVER
MAKES
NO
SENSE
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
HASBANI
RIVER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
FLOWS
INTO
THE
JORDAN
IF
I
AM
NOT
MISTAKEN
THE
LITANI
RIVER
FLOWS
IN
A
WESTSOUTHWESTERN
DIRECTION
AND
INDEED
DOES
NOT
RUN
THROUGH
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
THE
HASBANI
DOES
FLOW
INTO
THE
JORDAN
BUT
CONTRARY
TO
WHAT
OUR
IMAGINATIVE
POSTER
MIGHT
WRITE
THERE
HAS
BEEN
NO
INCREASE
IN
THE
INFLOW
FROM
THIS
RIVER
THAT
IS
NOT
PROPORTIONAL
TO
CLIMATIC
CHANGES
IN
RAINFALL
