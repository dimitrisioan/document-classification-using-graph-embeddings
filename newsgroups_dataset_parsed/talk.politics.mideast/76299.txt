TIM
CLOCK
WRITES
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
WHEN
GUERILLAS
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ISRAEL
SHOULD
TOTALLY
BACK
DOWN
SOTHE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
ATTACKING
ANOTHER
IS
TO
USE
AN
INNOCENT
AS
A
SHIELD
AND
HOPE
THAT
THE
OTHER
RESPECTS
INNOCENT
LIVES
TELL
ME
TIM
WHAT
ARE
THESE
GUERILLAS
DOING
WRONG
ASSUMING
THAT
THEY
ARE
USING
CIVILIANS
FOR
COVER
ASSUMING
ALSO
COME
ON
BRAD
IF
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
GET
ANYWHERE
IN
THIS
OR
ANY
DISCUSSION
IT
DOESNT
HELP
TO
BRING
UP
ELEMENTS
I
NEVER
ADDRESSED
NOR
COMMENTED
ON
IN
ANY
WAY
I
MADE
NO
COMMENT
ON
WHO
IS
RIGHT
OR
WHO
IS
WRONG
ONLY
THAT
CIVILIANS
ARE
BEING
USED
AS
COVER
AND
THAT
HAVING
BEEN
PLACED
IN
BETWEEN
THE
ISRAELIS
AND
THE
GUERILLAS
THEY
WILL
BE
INJURED
AS
BOTH
PARTIES
CONTINUE
THEIR
FIGHT
PARDON
ME
TIM
BUT
I
DO
NOT
SEE
HOW
IT
CAN
BE
POSSIBLE
FOR
THE
IDF
TO
FAIL
TO
DETECT
THE
PRESENCE
OF
THOSE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
PLANTING
THE
BOMB
WHICH
KILLED
THE
THREE
IDF
TROOPS
AND
THEN
LATER
KNOW
THE
EXACT
NUMBER
AND
WHEREABOUTS
OF
ALL
OF
THEM
SEVERAL
VILLAGES
WERE
SHELLED
HOW
COULD
THE
IDF
POSSIBLY
HAVE
KNOWN
THAT
THERE
WERE
GUERRILLAS
IN
EACH
OF
THE
TARGETTED
VILLAGES
YOU
SEE
IT
WAS
AN
ARBITRARY
ACT
OF
RETALIATION
IF
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
IS
TO
PREVENT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
IS
IT
NOT
WORKING
WHY
IS
IT
FURTHER
NECCESSARY
FOR
ISRAELI
GUNS
TO
POUND
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
WHY
NOT
JUST
KILL
THOSE
WHO
TRY
TO
INFILTRATE
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
YOU
SEE
THERE
IS
MORE
TO
THE
SHELLING
OF
THE
VILLAGES
IT
IS
CALLED
RETALIATION
GETTING
BACKGETTING
EVEN
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
SHELL
THE
VILLAGES
THE
LEAST
IT
SHOWS
IS
A
RECKLESS
DISREGARD
BY
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
FOR
THE
LIVES
OF
CIVILIANS
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
HERE
I
HAVE
ALWAYS
THOUGHT
THAT
ISRAELS
BOMBING
SORTEES
AND
BOMBING
POLICY
IS
STUPID
THOUGHTLESS
INHUMANE
AND
INEFFECTIVE
BUT
THERE
IS
NO
REASON
THAT
ISRAEL
SHOULD
PASSIVE
WAIT
UNTIL
ATTACKERS
CHOSE
TO
ACT
THERE
IS
EVERY
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
TAKING
THE
FIGHT
TO
THE
ENEMY
WILL
DO
MORE
TO
STOP
ATTACKS
AS
I
SAID
PREVIOUSLY
ISRAEL
SPENT
SEVERAL
DECADES
SITTING
PASSIVELY
ON
ITS
SIDE
OF
A
BORDER
AND
ONLY
ACTING
TO
STOP
THESE
ATTACKS
AFTER
THE
ATTACKERS
HAD
ENTERED
ISRAELI
TERRITORY
IT
DIDNT
WORK
VERY
WELL
THE
HOST
ARAB
STATE
DID
LITTLENOTHING
TO
TRY
AND
STOP
THESE
ATTACKS
FROM
ITS
SIDE
OF
THE
BORDER
WITH
ISRAEL
SO
THE
NUMBER
OF
ATTACKS
WERE
CONSIDERABLY
HIGHER
AS
WAS
THEIR
PHYSICAL
AND
PSYCHOLOGICAL
IMPACT
ON
THE
CIVILIANS
CAUGHT
IN
THEIR
PATH
THE
PROBLEM
TIM
IS
THAT
THE
ORIGINAL
REASON
FOR
THE
INVASION
WAS
PALESTINIAN
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
NOT
LEBANESE
ATTACKS
WHATSO
THE
WHOLE
BIT
ABOUT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
NEIGHBORING
ARAB
STATES
CAN
START
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
WHILE
I
ALSO
HOPE
FOR
THIS
TO
HAPPEN
IT
WILL
ONLY
OCCUR
WHEN
ARAB
STATES
SHOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
PREPARED
TO
TAKE
ON
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
THE
DUTY
TO
STOP
GUERILLA
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
THEIR
SOIL
THEY
HAVE
TO
PROVE
IT
OR
PROVIDE
SOME
GUARATEES
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
ISRAEL
IS
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
THEIR
WORD
NOT
WITH
THEIR
PAST
ATTITUDE
OF
TOLERANCE
TOWARDS
ANTIISRAEL
GUERILLAS
INRESIDENCE
IF
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
OTHERS
THEN
IMHO
IT
HAS
NO
BUSINESS
WASTING
OTHERS
TIME
COMING
TO
THE
PEACE
TALKS
THIS
IS
JUST
ANOTHER
SELECTIVELY
APPLIED
STATEMENT
THE
REASON
FOR
THIS
DRAWNOUT
IMPASSE
BETWEEN
ABABSPALESTINIANS
AND
ISRAELIS
IS
THAT
NEITHER
SIDE
IS
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
THE
OTHER
BY
YOUR
CRITERIA
EVERYONE
SHOULD
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THE
NEGOTIATIONS
THAT
IS
PRECISELY
WHY
THE
PALESTINIANS
IN
THEIR
RECENT
PISGA
PROPOSAL
FOR
THE
INTERIM
PERIOD
AFTER
NEGOTIATIONS
AND
LEADING
UP
TO
FULL
AUTONOMY
ARE
DEMANDING
CONDITIONS
THAT
ESSENTIALLY
DEFINE
AUTONOMY
ALREADY
THEY
DO
NOT
TRUST
THAT
ISRAEL
WILL
FOLLOW
THROUGH
THE
ENTIRE
PROCESS
AND
ALLOW
PALESTINIANS
TO
REACH
FULL
AUTONOMY
DO
YOU
UNDERSTAND
AND
ACCEPT
THIS
VIEWPOINT
BY
THE
PALESTINIANS
IF
YOU
DO
THEN
WHY
SHOULD
ISRAELS
VIEW
OF
ARABSPALESTINIANS
BE
ANY
DIFFERENT
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
TRUST
THE
ARABPALESTINIANS
WORDS
SINCE
THEY
DONT
THEY
ARE
VERY
RELUCTANT
TO
GIVE
UP
TANGIBLE
ASSETS
LAND
CONTROL
OF
AREAS
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
WORDS
FOR
THIS
REASON
THEY
ARE
ALSO
CONCERNED
ABOUT
THE
SORTS
OF
GUARANTEES
THEY
WILL
HAVE
THAT
THE
ARABS
WILL
FOLLOW
THROUGH
ON
THEIR
PART
OF
ANY
AGREEMENT
REACHED
FIRST
I
BELIEVE
THAT
MY
STATEMENT
APPLIES
TO
BOTH
SIDES
HAVING
SAID
THAT
I
THINK
IT
IS
NECCESSARY
TO
SEPARATE
WHAT
IS
LEGITIMATELY
NEGOTIABLE
AND
WHAT
IS
NOT
FOR
EXAMPLE
NO
COUNTRY
HAS
THE
RIGHT
TO
ABUSE
ONES
HUMAN
RIGHTS
DECIDING
WHETHER
THERE
WILL
BE
ONE
OR
TWO
STATES
IN
PALESTINE
IS
A
LEGITIMATE
QUESTION
WHILE
DE
FACTO
ONE
STATE
EXISTS
ISRAEL
MUST
TREAT
ALL
WITHIN
ITS
DOMAIN
EQUITABLY
TIM
YOU
ARE
IGNORING
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PALESTINIANS
IN
LEBANON
HAVE
BEEN
DISARMED
HEZBOLLAH
REMAINS
THE
ONLY
INDEPENDENT
MILITIA
HEZBOLLAH
DOES
NOT
ATTACK
ISRAEL
EXCEPT
AT
A
FEW
TIMES
SUCH
AS
WHEN
THE
IDF
BURNED
UP
SHEIKH
MOSAVI
HIS
WIFE
AND
YOUNG
SON
WHILE
THE
MAJOR
ARMAMENTS
THOSE
ALLOWING
PEOPLE
TO
WAGE
CIVIL
WARS
HAVE
BEEN
REMOVED
THE
WEAPONS
NEEDED
TO
CROSSBORDER
ATTACKS
STILL
REMAIN
TO
SOME
EXTENT
ROCKET
ATTACKS
STILL
CONTINUE
AND
COMMANDO
RAIDS
ONLY
REQUIRE
A
FEW
EASILY
CONCEALED
WEAPONS
AND
A
REFINED
DISREGARD
FOR
HUMAN
LIFE
YOURS
OF
THAT
OF
OTHERS
SUCH
ATTACKS
ALSO
CONTINUE
YES
I
AM
AFRAID
THAT
WHAT
YOU
SAY
IS
TRUE
BUT
THAT
STILL
DOES
NOT
JUSTIFY
OCCUPYING
YOUR
NEIGHBORS
LAND
ISRAEL
MUST
RESOLVE
ITS
DISPUTES
WITH
THE
NATIVE
PALESTINIANS
IF
IT
WANTS
PEACE
FROM
SUCH
ATTACKS
OF
COURSE
IF
ISRAEL
WOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
LEBANON
AND
STOP
ASSASSINATING
PEOPLE
AND
SHELLING
VILLAGES
THEY
WOULDNT
MAKE
THE
LEBANESE
SO
MAD
AS
TO
DO
THAT
BAT
GUANO
THE
SITUATION
YOU
CALL
FOR
EXISTED
IN
THE
AND
ATTACKS
WERE
COMMONPLACE
NOT
TRUE
LEBANESE
WERE
NOT
ATTACKING
ISRAEL
IN
THE
WITH
A
STRONG
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
FREE
FROM
SYRIAN
AND
ISRAELI
INTERFERENCE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BORDER
COULD
BE
ADEQUATELY
PATROLLED
THE
PALESTINIAN
HEAVY
WEAPONS
HAVE
BEEN
SIEZED
IN
PAST
YEARS
AND
I
DO
NOT
SEE
AS
SIGNIFICANT
A
THREAT
AS
ONCE
EXISTED
PLEASE
TIM
DONT
FALL
INTO
THE
TRAP
OF
TREATING
LEBANESE
AND
PALESTINIANS
AS
ALL
PART
OF
THE
SAME
GROUP
THERE
ARE
TOO
MANY
WHO
THINK
ALL
ARABS
OR
ALL
MUSLIMS
ARE
THE
SAME
TOO
MANY
TIMES
I
HAVE
SEEN
PEOPLE
SUPPORT
THE
BOMBING
OF
PALESTINIAN
CAMPS
IN
RETALIATION
FOR
AN
IDF
DEATH
AT
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
OR
THE
SHELLING
OF
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
IN
RETALIATION
FOR
A
PALESTINIAN
ATTACK
