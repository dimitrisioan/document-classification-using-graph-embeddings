ive
read
most
of
the
history
books
dealing
with
this
period
good
and
bad
and
while
it
is
possible
that
i
missed
one
or
two
none
of
those
ive
read
documents
any
razing
of
mosques
so
i
think
that
this
remarkable
claim
requires
specific
documentation
jake
disrespectfully
demands
and
adam
requires
specific
documentation
of
the
razing
of
mosques
in
jerusalem
if
either
of
them
had
been
reading
tpm
for
a
while
they
would
already
have
seen
such
documentation
for
the
forgetful
or
newcomers
however
here
are
the
references
thanks
for
posting
the
references
i
do
not
normally
read
tpm
and
i
posted
my
request
for
references
because
jims
article
was
crossposted
to
socculturejewish
allegations
of
jewish
disrespect
for
the
objects
and
buildings
of
other
religions
are
one
of
antisemitic
stereotypes
that
permeate
western
culture
and
rumors
of
church
and
host
desacration
probably
caused
more
pogroms
than
blood
libel
the
stereotypes
that
pervade
our
culture
create
cognitive
illusions
that
reify
those
stereotypes
therefore
any
claim
that
appears
to
reify
a
stereotype
should
be
treated
by
decent
people
with
utmost
suspicion
until
and
unless
documented
if
such
a
claim
is
crossposted
to
a
news
group
in
which
it
has
not
been
documented
before
such
as
scj
a
reference
should
be
given
the
first
time
it
appears
now
that
the
claim
has
been
documented
i
regard
the
whole
episode
as
disgusting
and
shameful
especially
so
because
the
official
who
failed
to
provide
proper
temporary
facilities
for
the
evicted
jordanians
was
probably
jewish
and
as
a
jew
i
know
that
he
should
have
known
better
