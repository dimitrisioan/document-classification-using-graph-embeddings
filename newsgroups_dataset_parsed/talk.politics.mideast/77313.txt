i
will
readily
admit

i
am
no
authority
in
this
area

other
posteers
asserted
that
some
muslims
did
join
hands
with
croats
and
nazis
in
persecuting
serbs

any

the
best
evidence
you
can
find
is
second

hearsay
from
an
unnamed
source
you
may
indeed
be
confusing
some
muslims
with
nazi
armenians

that

from
france
bore
the
mark
legion
that
nazi
armenians
like
dro
the
butcher
and
nezhdeh
sided
with
the
germans
probably
had
an
impact
on
the
decision
of
armenians
who
overwhelmingly
opted
for
armed
service
