WRITES
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
MANY
READERS
OF
THIS
CONFERENCE
ARE
INTERESTED
WHO
IS
BEHIND
THE
CENTER
FOR
POLICT
RESEARCH
I
WILL
OBLIGE
TRUMPETS
PLEASE
MY
NAME
IS
ELIAS
DAVIDSSON
ICELANDIC
CITIZEN
BORN
IN
PALESTINE
MY
MOTHER
WAS
THROWN
FROM
GERMANY
BECAUSE
SHE
BELONGED
TO
THE
UNDESIRABLES
AT
THAT
TIMES
THIS
GROUP
WAS
DEFINED
AS
JEWS
SHE
WAS
FORCED
TO
GO
TO
PALESTINE
DUE
TO
MANY
CYNICAL
FACTORS
FORCED
TO
GO
TO
PALESTINE
HOW
DREADFUL
UNLIKE
OTHER
UNDESIRABLESJEWS
SHE
WASNT
FORCED
TO
GO
INTO
A
GAS
CHAMBER
FORCED
UNDER
A
BULLDOZER
THROWN
INTO
A
RIVER
FORCED
INTO
A
MEDICAL
EXPERIMENT
LIKE
A
RAT
FORCED
TO
MARCH
UNTIL
SHE
DROPPED
DEAD
BURNED
TO
NOTHINGNESS
IN
A
CREMATORIUM
YOUR
MOTHER
WAS
FORCED
TO
GO
TO
PALESTINE
YOU
HAVE
OUR
DEEPEST
SYMPATHIES
I
HAVE
MEANWHILE
SETTLED
IN
ICELAND
YEARS
AGO
WE
ARE
PLEASED
TO
HEAR
OF
YOUR
ESCAPE
AT
LEAST
YOU
WONT
HAVE
TO
SUFFER
THE
SAME
FATE
THAT
YOUR
MOTHER
DID
AND
MET
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
THROWN
OUT
FROM
MY
HOMELAND
PALESTINE
YOUR
HOMELAND
PALESTINE
BECAUSE
OF
THE
SAME
REASON
THEY
BELONGED
TO
THE
INDESIRABLES
SHOULD
WE
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
ARE
REFERING
HERE
TO
JEWS
WHO
WERE
KICKED
OUT
OF
THEIR
HOMES
IN
JERUSALEM
DURING
THE
JORDANIAN
OCCUPATION
OF
EAST
JERUSALEM
THESE
ARE
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
NOW
BEING
CALLED
THIEVES
FOR
RECLAIMING
HOUSES
THAT
THEY
ONCE
OWNED
AND
LIVED
IN
AND
NEVER
SOLD
TO
ANYONE
THESE
PEOPLE
INCLUDE
MY
NEIGHBORS
IN
JERUSALEM
WITH
THE
CHILDREN
OF
WHOM
I
PLAYED
AS
CHILD
THEIR
CRIME
THEYARE
NOT
JEWS
I
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
NOT
BEING
A
JEW
AS
A
CRIME
CERTAINLY
IN
ISRAEL
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
CRIME
IN
SOME
TIMES
AND
PLACES
BEING
A
JEW
IS
A
CRIME
BUT
NOT
BEING
A
JEW
MY
CONSCIENCE
DOES
NOT
ACCEPT
SUCH
INJUSTICE
PERIOD
OUR
BRAINS
DO
NOT
ACCEPT
YOUR
LOGIC
YET
EITHER
MY
WORK
FOR
JUSTICE
IS
DONE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
MY
PRINCIPLED
OPPOSITION
TO
RACISM
AND
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
THOSE
WHO
PROTEST
AGAINST
SUCH
PRACTICES
IN
ARAB
COUNTRIES
HAVE
MY
SUPPORT
AS
LONG
AS
THEIR
PROTEST
IS
BASED
ON
A
PRINCIPLED
POSITION
BUT
NOT
AS
A
TACTIC
TO
DEFLECT
CRITICISM
FROM
ISRAEL
THE
WAY
YOUVE
WRITTEN
THIS
YOU
SEEM
TO
ACCEPT
CRITICISM
IN
THE
ARAB
WORLD
UNLESS
IT
DEFLECTS
CRITICISM
FROM
ISRAEL
IN
WHICH
CASE
WE
HAVE
TO
PRESUME
YOU
NO
LONGER
SUPPORT
CRITICISM
OF
THE
ARAB
WORLD
THE
STRUGGLE
AGAINST
DISCRIMINATION
AND
RACISM
IS
UNIVERSAL
LOOK
WHOS
TALING
ABOUT
DISCRIMINATION
NOW
THE
CENTER
FOR
POLICY
RESEARCH
IS
A
NAME
I
GAVE
TO
THOSE
ACTIVITIES
UNDERTAKEN
UNDER
MY
GUIDANCE
IN
DIFFERENT
DOMAINS
AND
WHICH
COMMAND
THE
SUPPORT
OF
MANY
VOLUNTEERS
IN
ICELAND
IT
IS
HOWEVER
NOT
A
FORMAL
INSTITUTION
AND
WORKS
WITH
MINIMAL
FUNDS
BE
CAREFUL
YOU
ARE
STARTING
TO
SOUND
LIKE
BARFLING
PROFESSIONALLY
I
AM
MUSIC
TEACHER
AND
COMPOSER
I
HAVE
PUBLISHED
SEVERAL
PIECES
AND
MY
PIANO
MUSIC
IS
TAUGHT
WIDELY
IN
EUROPE
I
WOULD
HOPE
THAT
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
ISRAELPALESTINE
BE
CONDUCTED
IN
A
MORE
CIVILIZED
MANNER
CALLING
NAMES
IS
NOT
HELPFUL
GOOD
DONT
