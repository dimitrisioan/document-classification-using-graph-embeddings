this
is
actually
the
law
that
david
irving
will
hopefully
be
found
guilty
under
due
to
his
denial
of
the
holocaust
its
too
bad
that
this
useless
centre
for
policy
research
isnt
in
canada
itd
set
a
nice
precedent
to
how
the
law
applies
in
cyberspace
steve
well
canada
is
wrong
if
it
was
in
the
us
the
aclu
would
have
made
sure
that
such
repressive
laws
are
found
unconstitutional
do
you
think
the
church
didnt
find
galileos
perception
of
the
universe
offensive
bull
shit
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
we
cant
say
that
taking
views
analogous
to
the
kkks
or
some
such
organization
is
wrong
there
is
no
reason
why
some
morality
may
not
be
legislated
as
it
is
we
do
not
allow
theft
or
murder
or
rape
why
should
we
allow
hateful
sppech
whose
only
purpose
is
to
stir
anger
and
violence
