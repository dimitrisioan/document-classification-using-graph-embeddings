MAY
THE
DECISION
TO
VIEW
THE
SETTING
UP
OF
A
LOCAL
POLICE
FORCE
FOR
SIC
THE
PALESTINIANS
AS
THE
CENTRAL
ISSUE
FOR
DELIBERATION
AT
THE
PEACE
TALKS
TO
BE
RESUMED
NEXT
WEEK
EVEN
BEFORE
SUBJECTS
LIKE
ELECTIONS
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
AND
AREAS
OF
JURIDICTION
IN
THE
FRAMEWORK
OF
AUTONOMY
IS
A
SIGN
OF
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENTS
SERIOUS
ATTITUDE
TOWARDS
THE
PEACE
PROCESS
THE
SETTING
UP
OF
A
POLICE
FORCE
IS
NOT
PART
OF
THE
GESTURE
PACKAGE
BUT
DEALS
WITH
THE
VERY
HEART
AND
SUBSTANCE
OF
THE
PALESTINIAN
STRUGGLE
FOR
NATIONAL
IDENTITY
AS
IT
TURNS
OUT
THE
MAIN
OBJECTIVE
GUIDING
THE
PRIME
MINISTER
IN
THE
SETTING
UP
OF
A
PALESTINIAN
POLICE
FORCE
AND
APPARENTLY
ALSO
SUPPORTED
BY
FOREIGN
MINISTER
SHIMON
PERES
IS
TO
ENSURE
THE
HOLDING
OF
DEMOCRATIC
ELECTIONS
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
THUS
WRITES
AMNON
BARZILAI
IN
HIS
EDITORIAL
ISRAELI
DAILY
HADASHOT
APRIL
AND
HIS
POSITION
ARTICULATES
THE
THINKING
OF
MOST
OF
THE
COMMENTATORS
WHO
DEALT
WITH
THIS
ISSUE
IN
THE
PAST
TWO
WEEKS
OVER
AGAINST
THEM
STAND
THE
SETTLERS
AND
RIGHTWING
PARTIES
WHO
ALSO
INTERPRET
THE
DECISION
TO
ENCOURAGE
THE
ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
PALESTINIAN
POLICE
FORCE
AS
A
SIGNIFICANT
STEP
TOWARDS
THE
INSTITUTING
OF
REAL
AUTONOMY
SOMETHING
WHICH
WILL
RESTRICT
WHAT
CAN
BE
DONE
BY
THE
JEWISH
SETTLERS
IN
THE
WEST
BANK
AND
GAZA
STRIP
WITH
A
VARIETY
OF
DEMONSTRATIONS
INCLUDING
STREET
THEATER
ON
WHAT
WILL
HAPPEN
WHEN
THERE
IS
A
PALESTINIAN
POLICE
FORCE
RIGHTWING
ELEMENTS
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
FRIGHTEN
THE
ISRAELI
PUBLIC
AND
TO
PRESSURE
RABIN
TO
GO
BACK
ON
HIS
DECISION
MEMBERS
OF
THE
KACH
MOVEMENT
HAVE
EVEN
BEGUN
TO
ORGANIZE
A
SETTLER
POLICE
FORCE
IN
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
AS
COUNTERBALANCE
TO
THE
FUTURE
PALESTINIAN
POLICE
FORCE
HOWEVER
AS
BARZILAI
POINTS
OUT
THE
MAIN
FUNCTION
OF
THE
NEW
POLICE
FORCE
AS
FAR
AS
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
IS
CONCERNED
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
SETTLERS
OVER
WHOM
THEY
WILL
APPARENTLY
HAVE
NO
AUTHORITY
BUT
WILL
CONTROL
POLITICAL
GROUPS
WITHIN
THE
PALESTINIAN
POPULATION
WHOM
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
INTERESTED
IN
NEUTRALIZING
WRITES
BARZILAI
ACCORDING
TO
IDEAS
CURRENTLY
TAKING
SHAPE
THE
SETTING
UP
OF
A
LOCAL
POLICE
FORCE
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
WILL
PRECEDE
NOT
ONLY
THE
STAGE
OF
ELECTSION
BUT
ALSO
THE
FINAL
STAGES
OF
THE
PREPARING
OF
THE
INTERIM
AUTONOMY
AGREEMENT
THE
WILLINGNESS
OF
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
TO
SET
UP
A
LOCAL
PALESTINIAN
POLICE
FORCE
IS
EVIDENCE
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
IS
SERIOUS
ABOUT
ARRIVING
AT
A
SETTLEMENT
WITH
THE
PALESTINIANS
ITS
NO
WONDER
THAT
THE
PALESTINIAN
PUBLIC
IS
ALSO
GREATLY
WORRIED
ABOUT
THIS
NEW
ISRAELI
INITIATIVE
AND
IT
IS
INEVITABLE
THAT
PRESSURE
WILL
BE
BROUGHT
TO
BEAR
ON
FAISAL
HUSSEINI
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
DELEGATION
MEMBERS
FROM
A
VARIETY
OF
DIRECTIONS
TO
REFUSE
THE
GIFT
WHICH
RABIN
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GIVE
THEM
BUT
AT
THIS
STAGE
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
THE
PALESTINIANS
ARE
COOPERATING
IN
THE
FULFILLMENT
OF
HIS
PLANS
ADDL
COMMENT
BY
ED
NUMEROUS
PALESTINIANS
FEAR
THAT
ISRAEL
MIGHT
SUCCEED
IN
COOPTING
SOME
PALESTINIAN
CIRCLES
BY
THIS
IDEA
THEY
FEAR
THAT
A
PALESTINIAN
POLICE
FORCE
CONTROLLED
IN
FACT
BY
ISRAEL
MIGHT
ACT
EVEN
MORE
BRUTALLY
THAN
THE
IDF
THE
IDEA
OF
USING
A
SURROGATE
POLICE
FORCE
IS
NOT
NEW
IT
IS
USED
BY
ISRAEL
IN
LEBANON
AND
WAS
USED
BY
THE
NAZIS
TO
CONTROL
JEWISH
GHETTODWELLERS
