ARRANGEMENT
BY
THE
TIME
PISGA

INAUGURATED
THE

OF
THE
UN
SECURITY
COUNCIL
THE
SECRETARY
GENERAL
OF
THE
UN
THE
PISGA
JORDAN
EGYPT
SYRIA
AND
ISRAEL
BUT
PERHAPS
THE
BARGAINING
ATTITUDE
BEHIND
THESE
VERY
DIFFERENT
VISIONS
OF
THE
INTERIM
STAGE
IS
WRONG
FOR
TWO
REASONS
THE
PRESENT
PALESTINIAN
AND
ISRAELI
LEADERSHIP
ARE
AS
MODERATE
AS
IS
LIKELY
TO
EXIST
FOR
MANY
YEARS
SO
THE
PRESENT
OPPORTUNITY
MAY
BE
THE
LAST
FOR
A
SIGNIFICANT
PERIOD
SINCE
THESE
NEGOTIATIONS
ARE
NOT
DESIGNED
TO
OR
EVEN
ATTEMPTING
TO
RESOLVE
THE
CONFLICT
ATTENTION
TO
ISSUES
DEALING
WITH
A
DESIRED
FINAL
STATUS
ARE
MIS
PLACED
AND
POTENTIALLY
DESTRUCTIVE
GIVEN
THIS
HOW
SHOULD
PROPOSALS
FROM
EITHER
SIDE
BE
ALTERED
TO
TEMPER
THEIR
MAXIMALIST
APPROACHES
AS
STATED
ABOVE
HOW
CAN
ISRAELI
WORRIES
AND
DESIRE
FOR
SOME
INTERIM
CONTROL
BE
ADDRESSED
WHILE
PROVIDING
FOR
A
VERY
REAL
INTERIM
PALESTINIAN
SELFGOVERNING
ENTITY
TIM
APRIL
RESPONSE
BY
AL
MOORE
BASICALLY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
ISRAEL
MAY
REMAIN
OR
LEAVE
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
IT
CANNOT
DO
BOTH
IT
CANNOT
DO
NEITHER
SO
FAR
ISRAE
CONTINUES
TO
PROPOSE
THAT
THEY
REMAIN
THE
PALESTINIANS
PROPOSE
THAT
THEY
LEAVE
WHY
SHOULD
EITHER
CHANGE
THEIR
VIEW
IT
IS
WORTH
POINTING
OUT
THAT
THE
ONLY
AREA
OF
COMPROMISE
ACCOMODATING
BOTH
VIEWS
SEEMS
TO
REQUIRE
A
REDUCTION
IN
THE
ISRAELI
PRESENCE
ISRAEL
PROPOSES
NO
SUCH
REDUCTION
AND
IN
FACT
MAY
BE
SAID
TO
NOT
BE
NEGOTIATING
TIM
THERE
SEEM
TO
BE
TWO
PERCEPTIONS
THAT
HAVE
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
THE
FIRST
IS
THAT
OF
ISRAEL
WHERE
THERE
IS
LITTLE
TRUST
FOR
ARAB
GROUPS
SO
THERE
IS
LITTLE
SUPPORT
FOR
ISRAEL
GIVING
UP
TANGIBLE
ASSETS
IN
EXCHANGE
FOR
PIECES
OF
PAPER
EXPECTATIONS
HOPES
ETC
THE
SECOND
IS
THAT
OF
THE
ARAB
WORLDPALESTINIANS
WHERE
THERE
IS
THE
DEMAND
THAT
THESE
TANGIBLE
CONCESSIONS
BE
MADE
BY
ISRAEL
WITHOUT
IT
RECEIVING
ANYTHING
TANGIBLE
BACK
GIVEN
THIS
THE
GAP
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
STANCES
SEEMS
TO
BE
THE
NEED
BY
ISRAEL
OF
RECEIVING
SOME
TANGIBLE
RETURNS
FOR
ITS
EXPECTED
CONCESSIONS
BY
TANGIBLE
IS
MEANT
SOMETHING
THAT
PROVIDES
ISRAEL
WITH
COMPARABLE
PROTECTION
FROM
THE
LAND
IT
IS
TO
GIVE
UP
IN
SOME
WAY
ENSURES
THAT
THE
ARAB
STATES
AND
PALESTINE
WILL
BE
ACCOUNTABLE
AND
HELD
ACTIVELY
NOT
JUST
DIPLOMATICALLY
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
THE
UPHOLDING
OF
ALL
ACTIONS
ON
ITS
TERRITORY
BY
CITIZENS
OR
VISITORS
IN
ESSENCE
I
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
ISRAEL
OBJECTIONS
TO
PALESTINIAN
STATEHOOD
WOULD
BE
ANYWHERE
NEAR
AS
STRONG
AS
THEY
ARE
NOW
IF
ISRAEL
WAS
ASSURED
THAT
ANY
NEW
PALESTINIAN
STATE
WOULD
BE
COMMITTED
TO
COEXISTING
WITH
ISRAEL
AND
HELD
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
ALL
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
ITS
TERRITORY
ASIDE
FROM
SOME
OF
THE
RATHER
SLANTED
PROPOSALS
ABOVE
HOW
COULD
SUCH
GUARANTEES
BE
INSTILLED
FOR
EXAMPLE
HOW
COULD
SUCH
GUARANTEESCONTROLS
BE
ADDED
TO
THE
PALESTINIAN
PISGA
PROPOSALS
ISRAEL
IS
HANGING
ON
LARGELY
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SCARED
STIFF
THAT
THE
MINUTE
IT
LETS
GO
GIVES
LANDS
BACK
TO
ARAB
STATES
NO
MORE
BUFFER
ZONE
GIVES
FULL
AUTONOMY
TO
PALESTINIANS
ANY
ANDOR
ALL
OF
THE
ARAB
PARTIES
COULD
AND
WOULD
IF
NOT
CONTROLLED
SOMEHOW
EASILY
RETURN
TO
THE
TRADITIONAL
ANTIISRAEL
POSITION
THE
QUESTION
THEN
IS
HOW
TO
REALLY
ENSURE
THAT
THAT
WILL
NOT
HAPPEN
TIM
