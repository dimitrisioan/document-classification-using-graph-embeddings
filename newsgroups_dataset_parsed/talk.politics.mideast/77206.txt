WRITES
IN

ADAM
L
SCHWARTZ
WRITES
WHICH
WAS
MY
POINT
BY
CONVERTING
TO
ANOTHER
RELIGION
I
DO
NOT
LOOSE
MY
CULTURAL
IDENTITY
I
JUST
LOOSE
MY
RELIGIOUS
IDENTIFICATION
I
CONSIDER
THAT
DEFINING
THE
BELONGING
TO
A
NATION
THAT
CLAIMS
THE
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
A
STATE
BASED
ON
RELIGIOUS
BELIEF
IS
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
TO
BE
A
PART
OR
NOT
OF
THE
JEISH
NATION
IS
DEFINED
BY
MY
CULTURE
AND
NOT
BY
MY
RELIGION
ACTUALLY
IF
I
AM
AN
ATHEIST
WHICH
IS
IN
FACT
LIKE
CONVERTING
INTO
A
NONJEWISH
IN
TERMS
OF
RELIGION
I
AM
STILL
CONSIDERED
AS
PART
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
I
CAN
BE
PROUD
OF
MY
JEWISH
CULTURE
WHILE
NOT
GIVING
ANY
IMPORTANCE
TO
THE
JEWISH
RELIGION
OR
EVEN
MORE
I
CAN
BE
PROUD
OF
MY
JEWISH
CULTURE
WHILE
STILL
BE
CONVINCED
THAT
THE
REAL
GOD
IS
ANOTHER
ONE
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
ANYONE
WHO
LOST
HIS
MEMEBERSHIP
TO
THE
AMERICAN
NATION
BECAUSE
HE
CHANGED
OF
GOD
ALBERTO
YOUVE
REPEATEDLY
MISUNDERSTOOD
MY
POSTINGS
YOU
ARE
NOW
MAKING
THE
EXACT
POINT
THAT
IVE
MADE
SEVERAL
TIMES
BUT
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
DEFINITION
OF
RELIGION
YOU
DONT
NOT
HAVE
TO
BELIEVE
IN
THE
RELIGIOUS
ASPECTS
OF
JUDAISM
TO
BE
A
JEW
THIS
WOULD
CONFINE
JUDAISM
TO
BE
JUST
A
RELIGION
IN
THE
SENSE
OF
A
CHRISTIANITY
SO
BY
CONVERTING
OUT
OF
JUDAISM
I
DONT
MEAN
JUST
NOT
BELIEVING
IN
THE
GOD
OF
JUDAISM
I
MEAN
VOLUNTARILY
REMOVING
YOURSELF
FROM
THE
JEWISH
NATION
I
AM
AN
AGNOSTIC
BUT
STILL
CONSIDER
MYSELF
JEWISH
BECAUSE
OF
MY
CULTURAL
HERITAGE
I
ADMIT
THAT
MANY
RELIGIOUS
JEWS
WOULD
ARGUE
THAT
I
AM
NOT
COMPLETELY
JEWISH
BECAUSE
OF
MY
LACK
OF
FAITH
BUT
JUDAISM
IS
A
RELIGION
OF
DISSENT
AND
DEBATE
ISNT
IT
THE
FACT
THAT
ONE
CAN
OPT
TO
BECOME
JEWISH
SIMPLY
BY
CONVERTING
TO
JUDAISM
MAKES
THE
NATION
OF
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
THE
LEAST
RACIST
AND
MOST
OPEN
NATION
WE
HAVE
NO
QUOTAS
SO
I
WILL
ONCE
AGAIN
MAKE
MY
POINT
DEFINING
A
MEMBER
OF
THE
JEWISH
NATION
BY
RELIGION
NOT
AS
YOU
SAY
RELIGIOUS
BELIEF
IS
NOT
RACISM
YOU
COME
TO
YOUR
INCORRECT
CONCLUSION
BECAUSE
YOU
USE
A
DIFFERENT
DEFINITION
FOR
RELIGION
WHEN
YOU
DEFINE
THE
LAW
OF
RETURN
AND
WHEN
YOU
DEFINE
JUDAISM
