DID
DIE
AT
DIR
YASSIN
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
MASSACRE
FIRST
OF
ALL
THE
VILLAGE
HOUSED
MANY
ARMED
TROOPS
NOBODY
EVER
PRODUCED
THE
MEAGEREST
EVIDENCE
FOR
THIS
IT
DOES
NOT
APPEAR
IN
SEVERAL
LONG
PUBLISHED
ACCOUNTS
BY
IRGUN
PARTICIPANTS
EVEN
SOME
IRGUN
PROPAGANDISTS
DO
NOT
MAKE
THIS
CLAIM
SECONDLY
THE
IRGUN
AND
STERN
FIGHTERS
HAD
ABSOLUTELY
NO
INTENTIONS
OF
KILLING
CIVILIANS
SEVERAL
MEMBERS
OF
THE

JABOTINSKY
INSTITUTE

WHICH
STATE
THAT
THE
LEHI
PROPOSED
TO
LIQUIDATE
THE
VILLAGE
AFTER
THE
CONQUEST
IT
SEEMS
THE
BEGIN
OVERRULED
THIS
PLAN
HOWEVER
THE
WILLINGNESS
OF
MANY
OF
THE
ATTACKERS
TO
SERIOUSLY
CONSIDER
THIS
POSSIBILITY
SERVES
AS
INSTRUCTIVE
CHARACTER
EVIDENCE
THE
VILLAGE
WAS
ATTACKED
ONLY
FOR
ITS
MILITARY
SIGNIFICANCE
THE
HAGANAH
TRIED
TO
GET
THE
IRGUN
TO
ATTACK
A
VILLAGE
WITH
REAL
MILITARY
SIGNIFICANCE
BUT
IT
WAS
CONSIDERED
TOO
HARD
THE
SOFT
TARGET
OF
DEIR
YASSIN
WAS
CHOSEN
INSTEAD
IN
FACT
A
WARNING
WAS
GIVEN
TO
THE
OCCUPANTS
OF
THE
VILLAGE
TO
LEAVE
BEFORE
THE
ATTACK
WAS
TO
BEGIN
THERE
WAS
INTENTION
PROBABLY
ORIGINATING
WITH
BEGIN
TO
GIVE
SUCH
A
WARNING
BUT
THE
LOUDSPEAKER
TRUCK
GOT
STUCK
IN
A
DITCH
BEFORE
REACHING
THE
VILLAGE
EVERYONE
KNOWS
THAT
BY
ALL
RATIONAL
STANDARDS
DIR
YASSIN
WAS
NOT
A
MASSACRE
BY
ALL
RATIONAL
STANDARDS
YOU
SHOULD
BE
POSTING
FROM
BCPU
THE
KILLING
WAS
UNINTENTIONAL
THE
VILLAGE
HOUSED
ARAB
SNIPERS
AND
ARAB
TROOPS
THUS
IT
WAS
ATTACKED
FOR
ITS
MILITARY
SIGNIFICANCE
IT
WAS
NOT
ATTACKED
WITH
INTENTIONS
OF
KILLING
ANY
CIVILIANS
A
LIE
REPEATED
IS
STILL
A
LIE
TO
EVEN
COMPARE
DIR
YASSIN
IN
WHICH
SOME
OR
SO
ARABS
DIED
TO
THE
HOLOCAUST
IS
ABSURD
THE
IRGUN
DID
NOT
WANT
TO
KILL
ANY
CIVILIANS
THE
VILLAGE
HAD
ALMOST
INHABITANTS
