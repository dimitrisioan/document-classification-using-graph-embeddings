PUT
YOUR
OWN
NAME
ON
PERHAPS
THE
STUPIDEST
OF
THEM
THE
FOLLOWING
PROPOSAL
IS
BASED
ON
THE
FOLLOWING
ASSUMPTIONS
FUNDAMENTAL
HUMAN
RIGHTS

AS
THE
RIGHT

ESTABLISH
A
FAMILY

HUMAN
DIGNITY
THE
RIGHT
TO

MOVEMENT
TO
FREE
EXPRESSION
ETC
ARE
MORE
IMPORTANT
TO
HUMAN
EXISTENCE
THAT
THE
RIGHTS
OF

DOES
THIS
MEAN
THAT
YOU
ARE
CALLING
FOR
THE
DISMANTLING
OF
THE
ARAB
STATES
IN
THE
EVENT
OF
A
CONFLICT
BETWEEN
BASIC
HUMAN
RIGHTS
AND

PREVAIL
APPARENTLY
YOUR

THESE
PROBLEM
BY
TRADITIONAL
MILITARY
MEANS
AND
NONTRADITIONAL
TERRORIST

THAT

STOP
THEM
FROM
TRYING
AGAIN
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
A
HOLY
WAR
YOU
KNOW
AS
LONG
AS
THE
CONFLICT
IS
PERCEIVED
AS
THAT
BETWEEN
TWO
DISTINCT
ETHNICALRELIGIOUS
COMMUNITIESPEOPLES
WHICH
CLAIM
THE
LAND
THERE
IS
NO
JUST
NOR
PEACEFUL
SOLUTION
POSSIBLE
NO
JUST
SOLUTION
POSSIBLE
HOW
VERY
ENCOURAGING
HAVING
STATED
MY
ASSUMPTIONS
I
WILL
NOW
STATE
MY
PROPOSAL
YOU
MEAN
THAT
IT
GETS
EVEN
FUNNIER
A
FUND
SHOULD
BE
ESTABLISHED
WHICH
WOULD
DISBURSE
GRANTS
FOR
EACH
CHILD
BORN
TO
A
COUPLE
WHERE
ONE
PARTNER
IS
ISRAELIJEW
AND
THE
OTHER
PALESTINIANARAB
FOR
THE
FIRST
CHILD
THE
GRANT
WILL
AMOUNT

FOR
THE
SECOND
THE
THIRD
CHILD
FOR
EACH
CHILD
FOR
EACH
SUBSEQUENT
CHILD
THE
GRANT
WILL
AMOUNT
TO
FOR
EACH
CHILD
THE
FUND
WOULD
BE
FINANCED
BY
A
VARIETY
OF
SOURCES
WHICH
HAVE
SHOWN
INTEREST
IN
PROMOTING
A
PEACEFUL
SOLUTION
TO
THE
ISRAELIARAB

THE
EMERGENCE
OF

CONSIDERABLE
NUMBER
OF
MIXED
MARRIAGES
IN
ISRAELPALESTINE
ALL
OF
WHOM
WOULD
HAVE
RELATIVES
ON
BOTH
SIDES
OF
THE
DIVIDE
WOULD
MAKE
THE
CONFLICT
LOSE
ITS
ETHNICAL
AND
UNSOLUBLE
CORE
AND
STRENGTHEN
THE
EMERGENCE
OF
A
TRULY
CIVIL
SOCIETY
YEAH
JUST
LIKE
MARRIAGES
AMONG
ARABS
HAS
STRENGTHENED
THEIR
SOCIETIES
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
STRONG
MIXED
