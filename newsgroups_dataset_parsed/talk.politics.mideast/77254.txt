I
CONSIDER
THAT
DEFINING
THE
BELONGING
TO
A
NATION
THAT
CLAIMS
THE
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
A
STATE
BASED
ON
RELIGIOUS
BELIEF
IS
A
FORM
OF
RACISM
ALTHOUGH
I
DONT
WANT
TO
MUDDY
THE
WATERS
UNNECESSARILY
I
DISAGREE
ANY
DISCRIMINATION
BASED
ON
RELIGION
IS
NOT
AND
CANNOT
BE
RACIST
UNLESS
THE
SOLE
QUALIFICATION
FOR
RELIGIOUS
MEMBERSHIP
IS
RACIAL
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
IN
WHICH
ANTISEMITE
MEANS
ANTIJEWISH
AND
NOT
ANTIALL
PERSONSOFWHOARESEMITE
A
FORM
OF

A
FORM
OF
SEGREGATION

ALL
THOSE
