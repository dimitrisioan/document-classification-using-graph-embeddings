RE
PLEASE
SHOW
UP
IN
WASHINGTON
DC
FOR
BOSNIA
MAY
IN
ARTICLE
PRABHAKGIGACSUMNEDU
SATYA
PRABHAKAR
WRITES
I
GUESS
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
BECAUSE
GERMANY
ALSO
CHOSE
A
PATH
OF
AGGRESSION
SIMULTANEOUSLY
THAT
PUT
THE
INTERESTS
OF
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
PERIL
I
WONDER
WHETHER
US
OR
OTHER
COUNTRIES
WOULD
HAVE
RISKED
THEMSELVES
IF
ONLY
JEWS
WERE
PERSECUTED
AND
HITLER
HAD
NO
IMPERIALIST
AMBITIONS
I
AM
NO
STUDENT
OF
HISTORY
AND
I
AM
JUST
ASKING
QUESTIONS
I
DONT
THINK
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
AFTER
ALL
THE
US
WAS
ONE
OF
THE
COUNTRIES
THAT
TURNED
AWAY
JEWISH
REFUGEES
WHEN
THERE
WAS
STILL
TIME
TO
GET
THEM
OUT
CONSIDERED
AND
REJECTED
AT
THE
CABINET
LEVEL
THEN
UNDER
WHAT
CONDITIONS
SHOULD
US
INTERFERE
IN
FOREGIN
COUNTRIES
IS
AN
ABSTRACTION
ONE
MUST
CLARIFY
BEFORE
RESORTING
TO
ACRIMONIOUS
ACCUSATIONS
OF
RELIGIOUS
BIGOTRY
AND
SUCH
AS
I
UNDERSTAND
IT
INTERNATIONAL
LAW
PROVIDES
THE
RIGHT
OF
ANY
COUNTRY
TO
INTERVENE
TO
PREVENT
GENOCIDE
I
THINK
ONCE
THE
WORLD
COURT
HAS
RULED
THAT
GENOCIDE
IS
BEING
COMMITTED
IF
A
HUMAN
RIGHTS
CZAR
IS
APPOINTED
AT
THE
UN
WE
COULD
HAVE
INTERNATIONAL
MONITORS
RECORDING
EVENTS
AND
RESPONSES
OF
LOCAL
OFFICIALS
AND
DEVELOP
AN
OBJECTIVE
BASIS
THIS
COULD
BE
BACKED
BY
ADJUDICATION
AT
THE
INTERNATIONAL
COURT
OF
JUSTICE
AND
ENFORCEMENT
THROUGH
A
RAPID
DEPLOYMENT
FORCE
UNDER
THE
UN
SECRETARY
GENERALS
COMMAND
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
THE
UN
DIRECTLY
IMPOSE
ICJ
RULINGS
WHENEVER
FEASIBLE
WITHOUT
THE
POSSIBILITY
OF
VETOS
AT
THE
UN
SECURITY
COUNCIL
MUCH
AS
THE
PRESIDENT
CANT
VETO
A
US
SUPREME
COURT
RULING
THE
US
IS
NOW
SUPPORTING
THE
EFFORT
TO
APPOINT
THE
HR
CZAR
THE
THIRD
WORLD
OPPOSITION
IS
LED
BY
THREE
COUNTRIES
CHINA
IRAN
AND
PAKISTAN
WHAT
COMPANY
IS
PAKISTAN
KEEPING
THE
US
IS
ALSO
RECONSIDERING
ITS
OPPOSITION
TO
THE
UN
FORCE
INITIALLY
ENVISAGED
IN
THE
CHARTER
ALTHOUGH
UNDER
THE
CONTROL
OF
THE
SECURITY
COUNCIL
THE
UN
SC
IS
QUITE
A
FLAWED
BODY
ROGUE
GOVERNMENTS
LIKE
THE
PRC
HAVE
EVEN
THREATENED
THEIR
VETO
IN
THE
LAST
FEW
MONTHS
TO
BLOCK
THE
MOVE
TO
PLACE
UN
TROOPS
IN
BOSNIA
UNDER
CHAPTER
INSTEAD
OF
IF
I
HAVE
THE
NUMBERS
STRAIGHT
WHERE
THEY
COULD
HAVE
MOVED
FROM
BEING
A
MONITORING
TO
AN
ENFORCEMENT
FORCE
WITHOUT
REQUIRING
FURTHER
SC
ACTION
THE
PRC
EVEN
CONTINUES
TO
THREATEN
USING
ITS
VETO
ON
UN
ACTION
DESPITE
THE
ICJ
RULING
THE
CURRENT
SETUP
REQUIRES
THE
SC
TO
ENFORCE
ICJ
RULINGS
PEACE
