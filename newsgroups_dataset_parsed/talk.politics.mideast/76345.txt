TEN
QUESTIONS
TO
ISRAELIS
DEAR
SHAI
YOUR
ANSWERS
TO
MY
QUESTIONS
ARE
UNSATISFACTORY
IN
THE
ANSWER
TO
MY
FIRST
QUESTION
CONCERNING
THE
NONEXISTENCE
OF
ISRAELI
NATIONALITY
YOUR
ANSWER
CONFLICTS
WITH
INFORMATION
I
HAVE
RECEIVED
FROM
OTHER
QUARTERS
ACCORDING
TO
WHICH
THERE
ARE
TWO
DISTINCT
CATEGORIES
OF
CLASSIFYING
ISRAELIS
CITIZENSHIP
EZRAHUT
AND
NATIONALITY
LEUM
THE
FORMER
IS
USED
ON
PASSPORTS
ETC
AND
THE
LATER
FOR
DAILY
IDENTIFICATION
IN
ISRAELI
SOCIETY
I
AM
TOLD
THAT
PEOPLE
IN
ISRAEL
HAVE
TO
CARRY
THEIR
ID
CARDS
AT
ALL
TIMES
AND
PRESENT
THEM
AT
MANY
PUBLIC
PLACES
ALMOST
EVERY
DAY
THESE
ID
CARDS
MAKE
CLEAR
WHO
THE
HOLDER
IS
A
JEW
OR
AN
ARAB
YOU
MAINTAIN
THAT
THIS
MAINLY
BECAUSE
OF
RELIGIOUS
SERVICES
PROVIDED
BUT
DO
YOU
REALLY
BELIEVE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
COULD
YOU
PROVIDE
EVIDENCE
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
AND
THAT
IT
SERVES
NO
OTHER
PURPOSE
IN
THE
ANSWER
TO
MY
SECOND
QUESTIONS
CONCERNING
THE
FACT
THAT
ISRAEL
HAS
NO
FIXED
BORDERS
YOU
STATE
THAT
ISRAELS
BORDERS
WERE
SHAPED
AND
RESHAPED
BY
BOTH
WAR
AND
PEACE
ACCORDING
TO
WHAT
I
READ
THE
FIRST
ZIONISTS
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
CENTURY
HAD
PLANS
FOR
THE
JEWISH
STATE
TO
EXTEND
INTO
WHAT
IS
LEBANON
AND
INTO
TRANSJORDAN
JORDAN
I
ALSO
READ
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
EXPRESS
WISH
OF
BENGURION
TO
NOT
DECLARE
ISRAELS
BORDERS
WHEN
ISRAEL
WAS
ESTABLISHED
AS
THIS
MIGHT
RESTRICT
ISRAELS
OPPORTUNITIES
FOR
LATER
EXPANSION
ISRAEL
OFTEN
CLAIMS
IT
RIGHT
OF
EXISTENCE
ON
THE
FACT
THAT
JEWS
LIVED
THERE
YEARS
AGO
OR
THAT
GOD
PROMISED
THE
LAND
TO
THEM
BUT
ACCORDING
TO
BIBLICAL
SOURCES
THE
AREA
GOD
PROMISED
WOULD
EXTEND
ALL
THE
WAY
TO
IRAQ
AND
WHAT
WERE
THE
BORDERS
IN
BIBLICAL
TIMES
WHICH
ISRAEL
CONSIDERS
PROPER
TO
USE
TODAY
FINALLY
IF
ISRAEL
WANTS
PEACE
WHY
CANT
IT
DECLARE
WHAT
IT
CONSIDERS
ITS
LEGITIMATE
AND
SECURE
BORDERS
WHICH
MIGHT
BE
A
BASE
FOR
NEGOTIATIONS
HAVING
ALL
THE
ABOVE
FACTS
IN
MIND
ONE
CANNOT
BLAME
ARAB
COUNTRIES
TO
FEAR
ISRAELI
EXPANSIONISM
AS
A
NUMBER
OF
WARS
HAVE
PROVED
YOUR
ANSWER
TO
MY
THIRD
QUESTION
IS
TYPICAL
OF
A
STALINIST
PUBLIC
OFFICIAL
I
DONT
THINK
YOUR
ANSWER
IS
HONEST
YOU
REFER
ME
TO
VANUNUS
REVELATIONS
ABOUT
ISRAELS
NUCLEAR
ARSENAL
WITHOUT
EVALUATING
THE
TRUTHFULLNESS
OF
HIS
REVELATIONS
NOW
IF
HE
SAID
THE
TRUTH
THEN
WHY
SHOULD
HE
BEEN
PUNISHED
AND
IF
HE
LIED
WHY
SHOULD
HE
BE
PUNISHED
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
MORE
HONESTY
SOMEBODY
PROVIDED
AN
ANSWER
TO
THE
FOURTH
QUESTION
CONCERNING
HIDDEN
PRISONERS
IN
ISRAELI
PRISONS
HE
POSTED
AN
ARTICLE
FROM
MAARIV
DOCUMENTING
SUCH
CASES
IT
SEEMS
THAT
SUCH
PRISONERS
DO
EXIST
IN
ISRAEL
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
ABOUT
THAT
YOU
IMPLY
THAT
MY
QUESTIONS
SHOW
BIAS
AND
ARE
FORMULATED
IN
SUCH
A
WAY
TO
CAST
ASPERSIONS
UPON
ISRAEL
SUCH
TERMS
HAVE
OFTEN
BEEN
USED
BY
THE
SOVIET
UNION
AGAINST
DISSIDENTS
THEY
CALL
THE
SOVIET
UNION
INTO
DISREPUTE
IF
MY
QUESTIONS
ARE
NOT
DISTURBING
THEY
WOULD
NOT
CALL
FORTH
SUCH
HYSTERICAL
ANSWERS
MY
QUESTIONS
ARE
CLEARLY
PROVOCATIVE
BUT
THEY
ARE
MEANT
TO
SEEK
FACTS
I
WOULD
BE
VERY
HAPPY
IF
YOU
COULD
CONVINCE
ME
THAT
WHAT
I
AM
TOLD
ABOUT
ISRAEL
WERE
JUST
FABRICATIONS
BUT
ALAS
YOU
HAVE
FAILED
TO
DO
SO
I
SUSPECT
THAT
YOU
FEAR
THE
TRUTH
AND
AN
OPEN
AND
HONEST
DISCUSSION
THIS
IS
A
SIGN
OF
WEAKNESS
NOT
OF
STRENGTH
I
HOPE
YOU
WILL
MUSTER
THE
COURAGE
TO
SEEK
THE
FULL
TRUTH
