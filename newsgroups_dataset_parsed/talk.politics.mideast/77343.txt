ARMENIANS

ERDEM
ERGINEL
ASKED
EE
NO
NO
FLAMING
HERE
JUST
A
SIMPLE
QUESTION
WITH
A
SIMPLE
ANSWER
EE
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
MOST
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
BELONG
TO
THE
GREGORIAN
ORTHODOX
EE
FAITH
AND
SUCH
WAS
THE
CASE
IN
NINETEENTH
CENTURY
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
IT
IS
EE
ALSO
KNOWN
THAT
SOME
ARMENIAN
COMMUNITIES
WERE
CONVERTED
INTO
CATHOLICISM
EE
AND
PROTESTANTISM
BY
THE
WESTERN
EUROPEAN
MISSIONARIES
IN
THIS
PERIOD
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
ARMENIANS
IN
EASTERN
ANATOLIA
WERE
GREGORIAN
OR
ARMENIAN
APOSTOLIC
THERE
WAS
HOWEVER
A
HIGHER
PERCENTAGE
OF
NONGREGORIAN
ARMENIANS
IN
CILICIA
CLOSER
TO
THE
MEDITERRANEAN
IN
ADANA
MARASH
AINTAB
ETC
EE
ANOTHER
KNOWN
FACT
IS
THAT
ALMOST
HALF
OF
THE
ARMENIANS
LIVING
IN
ANATOLIA
EE
DID
NOT
SPEAK
ANY
ARMENIAN
BUT
USED
TURKISH
IN
THEIR
EVERYDAY
LIVES
THIS
IS
NOT
TRUE
WHILE
IT
WAS
FORBIDDEN
FOR
ARMENIANS
TO
SPEAK
ARMENIAN
IN
CERTAIN
AREAS
OF
CILICIAN
ARMENIA
MOST
ALL
ARMENIANS
SPOKE
ARMENIAN
IN
FACT
TURKS
WHO
INTERACTED
WITH
ARMENIANS
ALSO
SPOKE
ARMENIAN
FOR
SURE
MOST
ALL
ARMENIANS
ESPECIALLY
MEN
ALSO
KNEW
TURKISH
IN
ORDER
TO
FUNCTION
IN
LARGER
SOCIETY
EE
MY
QUESTION
IS
GIVEN
SO
MANY
SEPARATIONS
IN
THE
ARMENIAN
COMMUNITY
WHAT
EE
WAS
THE
COMMON
DENOMINATOR
OF
THE
ARMENIAN
PEOPLE
THAT
ALLOWED
ARMENIAN
EE
NATIONALISM
TO
EMERGE
IN
THE
NINETEENTH
CENTURY
AS
I
STATED
RELIGION
EE
WAS
NOT
UNIFORM
UNLIKE
THE
GREEKS
AND
MANY
ARMENIANS
COULDNT
EVEN
SPEAK
EE
ARMENIAN
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHAT
FACTORS
BROUGHT
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
THE
EE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
TOGETHER
AND
LED
TO
THE
FORMATION
OF
AN
ARMENIAN
EE
CONSCIOUSNESS
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
TURKEY
WERE
PERSECUTED
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
ARMENIAN
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
SPECIFIC
BRANCH
OF
CHRISTIANITY
THEY
PROFESSED
THE
RESULTANT
ARMENIAN
NATIONALISM
WAS
IN
DIRECT
REACTION
TO
THIS
PERSECUTION
EVEN
AT
THE
LATER
STAGES
OF
WWI
AND
AFTER
THE
GENOCIDE
MANY
ARMENIANS
WHO
WERE
CONVERTED
TO
ISLAM
WERE
ALSO
EXTERMINATED
BECAUSE
THEY
CONTINUED
AS
ARMENIAN
MOSLEMS
THIS
PRACTICE
CONTINUED
WELL
INTO
THE
BY
ATATURK
IN
PARALLEL
WITH
THE
POLICY
OF
CLEARING
OUT
POCKETS
OF
STEADFAST
ISLAMIC
FUNDAMENTALISM
MANY
OF
THESE
CONVERTED
ARMENIANS
IRONICALLY
IN
ORDER
TO
STAY
ALIVE
WERE
STAUNCH
MOSLEMS
EE
ANY
INFORMATION
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED
YOU
ANSWERED
YOUR
OWN
QUESTION
THE
COMMON
THREAD
THROUGHOUT
YOUR
