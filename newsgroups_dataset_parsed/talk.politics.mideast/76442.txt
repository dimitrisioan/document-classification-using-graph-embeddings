is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
we
cant
say
that
taking
views
analogous
to
the
kkks
or
some
such
organization
is
wrong
there
is
no
reason
why
some
morality
may
not
be
legislated
as

is
we
do
not
allow
theft

i
think
the
answer
to
mr

question
can
be
found
in
the
first
amendment
to
the
us
constitution
amendment
i
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
