TC
DO
YOU
AS
I
DO
AGREE
THAT
THIS
SORT
OF
PEACE
PROCESS
IS
NEEDED
TC
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
PARTICULAR
POINTS
MENTIONED
IN
THE
ARTICLE
IS
WHAT
TC
ISRAEL
IS
SUPPOSEDLY
GOING
TO
PROPOSE
GOOD
DOES
IT
GO
TOO
FAR
TC
NOT
FAR
ENOUGH
TC
IF
YOU
DONT
AGREE
THAT
A
PEACE
PROCESS
IS
NEEDED
WHAT
IS
I
PERSONALLY
THINK
THAT
A
PEACE
PROCESS
IS
NEEDED
SINCE
ONLY
THROUGH
NEGOTIATIONS
WILL
THE
FUTURE
GENERATIONS
BE
ABLE
TO
LIVE
IN
STABILITY
UNFORTUNATELY
NOT
ALL
THINK
LIKE
THIS
WE
HAVE
CASES
LIKE
ANAS
OMRAN
HAMZA
SALEH
JLE
MOHAMMED
REZA
MEHMED
ABUABED
ANWAR
MOHAMMED
AND
OTHERS
WHO
THINK
THAT
JIHAD
IS
THE
ONLY
SOLUTION
IF
WE
CANT
AVOID
THROWING
OUT
GUTREACTIONS
TO
WHAT
WE
SEE
AS
EXTREMIST
VIEWS
HERE
IN
THE
NEWSGROUP
WERE
CERTAINLY
NOT
GOING
TO
BE
ANY
BETTER
AT
IT
IN
THE
REAL
WORLD
HEY
IT
EASY
HERE
AFTER
READING
THE
OFFENDING
POST
WE
CAN
STEP
BACK
TAKE
SOME
DEEP
BREATHING
EXERCISES
HAVE
A
GALLON
OF
ICE
CREAM
OR
SEX
WHICHEVER
CALMSUS
AND
REPLY
IN
SOMETHING
OTHER
THAN
THE
USUAL
KINGOFTHEHILL
MENTALITY
MY
VIEW
IS
THAT
ISRAEL
HAS
MADE
MORE
GESTURES
TOWARDS
ITS
ARAB
FOES
THAN
THE
OPPOSITE
WHAT
HAVE
THE
SYSRIANS
GIVEN
TO
US
OR
PROPOSED
WHAT
HAVE
THE
PALESTINIANS
PROPOSED
IF
THE
PALESTINIANS
WOULD
JUST
REVOKE
OR
REWRITE
THEIR
CHARTER
OR
JUST
CONDEMN
ACTS
OF
PALESTINIAN
VIOLENCE
THAT
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
START
PERHAPS
STARTING
HERE
WITH
AN
IMMEDIATE
ACCUSATION
IS
NOT
A
PARTICULARLY
GOOD
WAY
TO
GENERATE
OPEN
RESPONSES
HOW
ABOUT
EXPLAINING
WHAT
YOU
SEE
AS
BEING
ISRAELS
REAL
WORRIES
AND
HOW
THEY
NEED
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
SINCE
THE
OTHER
SIDE
SEES
ISRAELS
GESTURES
IN
A
COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT
LIGHT
THAN
YOU
DO
PERHAPS
THEY
ALSO
HAVE
REAL
WORRIES
FROM
THEIR
POINT
OF
VIEW
WHAT
ARE
THEY
HOW
CAN
THOSE
WORRIES
BE
ADDRESSED
THE
PALESTINIANS
HAVE
ALL
TO
GAIN
FROM
THESE
NEGOTIATIONS
ITS
SEEMS
THOUGH
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
MAKE
DECISIONS
ON
THEIR
OWN
AND
ARE
PLAGUED
BY
INTERNAL
STRIFE
THAT
IS
WHY
WE
ARE
NOT
GETTING
ANYWHERE
FUNDAMENTALISM
IS
SLOWLY
TAKING
OVER
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
THEN
IT
WILL
BE
TOO
LATE
TO
DISCUSS
ISSUES
WITH
THE
PALESTINIANS
SINCE
THEY
WILL
ONLY
VOW
FOR
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
ISRAEL
IT
IS
CERTAINLY
MUCH
HARDER
TO
REACH
COMPROMISE
OR
EVEN
SIT
DOWN
AND
TALK
WITH
AN
OTHER
SIDE
WHICH
IS
FRACTURED
INTO
SEVERAL
DIFFERENT
IDEOLOGIES
EACH
WITH
ITS
OWN
SET
OF
DEMANDS
WHILE
IT
IS
UP
TO
THEM
TO
GENERATE
UNITY
ON
THEIR
SIDE
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
THAT
ISRAEL
CAN
DO
WITHOUT
SACRIFICING
ITS
SECURITY
ITS
POSITION
TO
ENCOURAGE
THAT
UNIFICATION
ALONG
LINES
THAT
ISRAEL
PREFERS
ARABS
MUST
TAKE
EXAMPLE
ON
EGYPT
EGYPT
CAME
TO
THE
BARGAINING
TABLE
GOT
WHAT
IT
WANTED
FROM
ISRAEL
AND
THERE
IS
NOW
PEACE
AND
COOPERATION
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
COUNTRIES
