imho
it
does
not
really
matter
who
started
any
individual
battle
within
the
arabsisreal
war
context
the
real
question
is
whowhat
started
the
war
does
anyone
have
any
doubts
it
was
the
creation
of
israel
on
arab
land
huh
a
war
was
started
when
several
armies
invaded
israel
vowing
to
drive
the
jews
into
the
sea
most
jews
wanted
to
live
in
peace
and
the
arabs
who
stayed
in
israel
were
granted
citizenship
i
am
surprised
that
you
dont
consider
the
acquisition
of
land
by
the
jews
from
arabs
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
an
exclusive
state
as
a
hostile
action
leading
to
war
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
state
not
an
exclusive
state
if
the
state
was
to
be
exclusive
it
would
not
have
arab
citizens
and
no
i
do
not
consider
the
purchase
of
land
a
hostile
action
when
someone
wants
to
buy
land
and
someone
else
is
willing
to
sell
it
at
a
mutually
agreeable
price
then
that
is
commerce
it
is
not
a
hostile
action
leading
to
war
as
to
whether
the
jews
wanted
to
live
in
peace
maybe
however
they
wanted
and
still
want
an
exclusively
jewish
state
where
jews
are
in
control
and
jews
are
the
masters
of
the
land
living
in
peace
is
meaningless
unless
it
means
living
with
someone
else
as
equal
for
a
native
arab
this
does
not
leave
many
options
oh
you
mean
like
both
jews
and
arabs
being
citizens
the
arabs
who
stayed
are
now
citizens
with
as
much
right
to
choose
who
they
vote
for
as
the
jews
those
palestinians
who
stayed
actually
stayed
despite
of
what
happened
and
their
number
was
somewhat
tolerated
as
a
defenseless
and
ineffective
minority
if
i
were
wrong
youd
have
israel
recall
all
the
palestinian
refugees
were
talking
millions
after
all
they
are
civilians
huh
the
people
who
left
did
so
voluntarily
there
is
no
reason
for
israel
to
let
them
in
israel
gave
citizenship
to
the
remaining
arabs
because
it
had
to
maintain
a
democratic
facade
to
keep
the
western
aid
flowing
israel
got
no
western
aid
in
nor
in
or
still
granted
citizenship
to
those
arabs
who
remained
and
how
is
granting
citizenship
a
facade
tell
me
something
sam
what
makes
land
arab
how
shall
i
explain
its
a
contract
between
the
man
and
the
land
control
isnt
it
the
ottomans
ruled
years
and
then
left
with
barely
a
trace
the
concept
of
land
identity
is
somewhat
foreign
to
the
mobile
and
pragmatic
west
it
is
partly
the
concept
of
le
sol
natal
native
soil
i
know
that
jews
had
previous
history
in
the
region
but
none
in
recent
memory
im
talking
everyday
life
not
archeology
try
again
you
tell
me
what
its
isnt
but
you
fail
to
establish
what
it
is
also
jews
did
have
history
in
israel
for
over
a
thousand
years
there
were
lots
of
jews
slaughtered
by
crusaders
in
israel
there
was
a
thriving
community
in
gaza
city
from
roughly
jews
were
a
majority
in
jerusalem
from
or
so
onwards
does
that
make
the
land
jewish

if
we
had
a

big
enough
for
drugs
and
sexual

we
sure
wouldnt
waste
them
