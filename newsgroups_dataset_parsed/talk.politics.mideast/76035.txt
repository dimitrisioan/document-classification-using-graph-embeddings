A

CAPITAL

OR
NOT
THE
ABOVE
IS
PURE
NONSENSE
IT
BM
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
SHORT
SIGHTED
ARMENIANS
ARE
ESCALATING
THE
HOSTILITIES
AGAIN
ARMENIANS
IN
KARABAKH
ARE
SIMPLY
DEFENDING
THEMSELVES
WHAT
DO
WANT
THEM
TO
DO
LAY
DOWN
THEIR
ARMS
AND
LET
AZERIS
WALK
ALL
OVER
THEM
BM
WHILE
HOPING
THAT
TURKEY
WILL
STAY
OUT
STOP
AND
THINK
FOR
A
MOMENT
BM
WILL
YOU
ARMENIA
DOESNT
NEED
ANYONE
TO
DRAG
HER
INTO
THE
CONFLICT
IT
BM
IS
A
PART
OF
IT
ARMENIANS
KNEW
FROM
THE
BEGINING
THAT
TURKS
WERE
FULLY
ENGAGED
TRAINING
AZERIS
MILITARILY
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
KARABAKHIARMENIANS
HENRIK
THE
KARABAKHIARMENIANS
WHO
HAVE
LIVED
IN
THEIR
HOMELAND
FOR
HENRIK
YEARS
CUT
OFF
FROM
ARMENIA
AND
GIVEN
TO
AZERIS
BY
STALIN
ARE
THE
HENRIK
ONES
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CONFLICT
THEY
ARE
DEFENDING
HENRIK
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
AZERI
AGGRESSION
BM
HUH
YOU
DIDNT
EXPECT
AZERIS
TO
BE
FRIENDLY
TO
FORCES
FIGHTING
WITH
THEM
BM
WITHIN
THEIR
BORDERS
WELL
HISTORY
IS
SAD
REMEMBER
THOSE
ARE
RELOCATED
AZERIS
INTO
THE
ARMENIAN
LAND
OF
KARABAKH
BY
THE
STALIN
REGIME
HENRIK
AT
LAST
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
US
INSISTS
THAT
TURKEY
STAY
OUT
OF
THE
HENRIK
KARABAKH
CRISIS
SO
THAT
THE
REPEAT
OF
THE
CYPRUS
INVASION
WILL
NEVER
HENRIK
OCCUR
AGAIN
BM
YOURE
NOT
PLAYING
WITH
A
FULL
DECK
ARE
YOU
WHERE
WOULD
TURKEY
INVADE
IT
IS
NOT
UP
TO
ME
TO
SPECULATE
BUT
I
AM
SURE
TURKEY
WOULD
HAVE
STEPPED
INTO
ARMENIA
IF
SHE
COULD
BM
ARE
YOU
THROWING
THE
CYPRUS
BUZZWORD
AROUND
WITH
SCG
IN
THE
HEADER
BM
IN
HOPES
THAT
THE
GREEK
NETTERS
WILL
JUMP
THE
GUN
ABSOLUTELY
NOT
I
AM
MERELY
TRYING
TO
EMPHASIZE
THAT
IN
MANY
CASES
HISTORY
REPEATS
ITSELF
BM
YES
INDEED
TURKEY
HAS
THE
MILITARY
PROWESS
TO
INTERVENE
WHAT
SHE
WISHES
BM
SHE
HAD
HOWEVER
IS
THE
DIPLOMATIC
POWER
TO
STOP
THE
HOSTILITIES
AND
BRING
BM
THE
PARTIES
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
THATS
HARD
TO
DO
WHEN
ARMENIANS
BM
ARE
ATTACKING
AZERI
TOWNS
SO
LET
ME
UNDERSTAND
IN
PLAIN
WORDS
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
TURKEY
WANTS
A
PEACEFUL
END
TO
THIS
CONFLICT
NOT
I
WILL
BELIEVE
IT
WHEN
I
SEE
IT
NOW
AS
FAR
AS
ATTACKING
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
WHEN
YOU
SEE
A
GUN
POINTING
TO
YOUR
HEAD
DO
YOU
SIT
THERE
AND
WATCH
OR
DEFEND
YOURSEFFAT
CHANCE
DO
YOU
REMEMBER
WHAT
AZERIS
DID
TO
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
BAKU
ALL
THE
BARBERIAN
ACTS
ESPECIALLY
AGAINST
MOTHERS
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
I
MEAN
BURNING
PEOPLE
ALIVE
BM
ARMENIAN
LEADERS
ARE
LACKING
THE
STATESMANSHIP
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
BM
FUTILITY
OF
ARMED
CONFLICT
AND
CONVINCE
THEIR
NATION
THAT
A
COMPROMISE
THAT
BM
LEADS
TO
STABILITY
IS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
A
MILITARY
FAITS
ACCOMPLIS
THATS
BM
GOING
TO
CAUSE
INCESSANT
SKIRMISHES
ARMENIANS
IN
KARABAKH
WANT
PEACE
AND
THEIR
OWN
REPUBLIC
THEY
ARE
NOT
ASKING
MUCH
THEY
SIMPLY
WANT
TO
GET
BACK
WHAT
WAS
TAKEN
AWAY
FROM
THEM
AND
GIVEN
TO
AZERIS
BY
STALIN
BM
THINK
OF
OR
YEARS
DOWN
THE
LINE
BOTH
OF
THE
NEWLY
INDEPENDENT
BM
COUNTRIES
NEED
TO
DEVELOP
ECONOMICALLY
AND
NEITHER
ONE
IS
GOING
TO
WIPE
BM
THE
OTHER
OUT
THESE
PEOPLE
WILL
BE
NEIGHBORS
WOULD
IT
NOT
BE
BETTER
BM
TO
KEEP
THE
BAD
BLOOD
BETWEEN
THEM
MINIMAL
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
ALSO
WANT
PEACEFUL
SOLUTION
TO
THE
CONFLICT
BUT
UNTIL
AZERIS
REALIZE
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
KARABAKH
WILL
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
AGGRESION
BM
IF
YOU
BELONG
TO
THE
ARMENIAN
DIASPORA
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
WHAT
STRIKES
BM
YOUR
FANCY
ON
THE
MAP
IS
COSTING
THE
LOCAL
ARMENIANS
DEARLY
IN
TERMS
OF
BM
THEIR
BLOOD
AND
FUTURE
AGAIN
YOU
ARE
TAKING
DIFFERENT
TURNS
ARMENIA
HAS
NO
INTENSION
TO
GRAB
ANY
LAND
FROM
AZERBAIJAN
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
KARABAKH
ARE
SIMPLY
DEFENDING
THEMSELVES
UNTIL
A
SOLUTION
IS
SET
BM
ITS
EASY
TO
BE
COMFORTABLE
ABROAD
AND
PROPAGANDIZE
BM
CRAZINESS
TO
HAVE
YOUR
FEELINGS
ABOUT
TURKS
TICKLED
THE
ARMENIANS
BM
IN
ARMENIA
AND
NK
WILL
BE
THERE
WITH
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
YOU
SEEM
TO
HATE
BM
AS
THEIR
NEIGHBORS
FOR
MAYBE
YEARS
MORE
THE
SOONER
THERES
PEACE
IN
BM
THE
REGION
THE
BETTER
IT
IS
FOR
THEM
AND
EVERYONE
ELSE
ID
PUSH
FOR
BM
COMPROMISE
IF
I
WERE
YOU
INSTEAD
OF
HITTING
THE
CAPSLOCK
AND
SPREADING
BM
INFLAMMATORY
HALFTRUTHS
IT
IS
NOT
UP
TO
ME
TO
DECIDE
THE
PEACE
INITIATIVE
I
AM
ABSOLUTELY
FOR
IT
BUT
IN
THE
MEANTIME
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
TAKE
CARE
OF
YOURSELF
YOU
WILL
BE
WIPED
OUT
SUCH
AS
THE
CASE
IN
THE
ERA
OF
OF
THE
ARMENIAN
MASSACRES
