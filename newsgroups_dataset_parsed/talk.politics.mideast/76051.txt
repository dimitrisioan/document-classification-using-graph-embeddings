I
GUESS
HASAN
FINALLY
REVEALED
THE
SOURCE
OF
HIS
CLAIM
THAT
ISRAEL
DIVERTED
WATER
FROM
LEBANONHIS
IMAGINATION
ALAN
H
STEIN
ASTEINISRAELNYSERNETORG
MR
WATERHEAD
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
ISRAEL
DIVERTED
LEBANESE
RIVERS
IN
FACT
I
SAID
THAT
ISRAEL
WENT
INTO
SOUTHERN
LEBANON
TO
MAKE
SURE
THAT
NO
WATER
IS
BEING
USED
ON
THE
LEBANESE
SIDE
SO
THAT
ALL
WATER
WOULD
RUN
INTO
JORDAN
RIVER
WHERE
THERE
ISRAEL
WILL
USE
IT
HEAD
OF
COURSE
POSTING
SOME
HARD
EVIDENCE
OR
FACTS
IS
MUCH
MORE
DIFFICULT
YOU
HAVE
NOT
BOTHERED
TO
SUBSTANTIATE
THIS
IN
ANY
WAY
BASIL
DO
YOU
KNOW
OF
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
WOULD
SUPPORT
THIS
I
CAN
JUST
IMAGINE
A
NEWS
REPORT
FROM
ANCIENT
TIMES
IF
HASAN
HAD
BEEN
WRITING
IT
NEWSFLASH
CAIRO
AP
ANCIENT
PRESS
ISRAEL
TODAY
DENIED
EGYPT
ACCES
TO
THE
RED
SEA
IN
A
TYPICAL
DISPLAY
OF
ISRAELITE
AGRESSIVENESS
THE
LEADER
OF
THE
ISRAELITE
SLAVE
REVOLT
FORMER
PRINCE
MOSES
PARTED
THE
RED
SEA
THE
ACTION
IS
ESTIMATED
TO
HAVE
CAUSED
IRREPARABLE
DAMAGE
TO
THE
ENVIRONMENT
EGYPTIAN
AUTHORITIES
HAVE
SAID
THAT
THOUSANDS
OF
FISHERMAN
HAVE
BEEN
DENIED
THEIR
LIVELIHOOD
BY
THE
PARTED
WATERS
PHARAOHS
BRAVE
CHARIOTEERS
WERE
SUCCESSFUL
IN
THEIR
GLORIOUS
ATTEMPT
TO
CAUSE
THE
WATERS
OF
THE
RED
SEA
TO
RETURN
TO
THEIR
NORMAL
STATE
UNFORTUNATELY
THEY
SUFFERED
HEAVY
CASUALTIES
WHILE
DOING
SO
HEHEHE
BTW
DOES
THE
LITANI
RIVER
NOT
FLOW
WEST
AND
NOT
SOUTH
I
THINK
THAT
ITS
WATERS
STAY
ENTIRELY
WITHIN
LEBANESE
TERRITORY
AND
SO
WHAT
HASAN
SAYS
ABOUT
THE
JORDAN
RIVER
MAKES
NO
SENSE
IN
ANY
CASE
THE
HASBANI
RIVER
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
FLOWS
INTO
THE
JORDAN
IF
I
AM
NOT
MISTAKEN
