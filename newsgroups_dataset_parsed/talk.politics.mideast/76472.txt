KAUFMAN
SAYS
HOW
MANY
OF
YOU
READERS
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
JEWS
LIVING
IN
THE
ARAB
COUNTRIES
HOW
MANY
OF
YOU
KNOW
IF
JEWS
STILL
LIVE
IN
THESE
COUNTRIES
HOW
MANY
OF
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF
ARABIC
JEWS
LEAVING
THEIR
HOMELANDS
WERE
JUST
CURIOUS
THE
LAST
ARAB
COUNTRY
WAS
SYRIA
BUT
NOT
ALL
OF
THEM
MIGRATED
DUE
TO
THE
JEWISH
STATE
ECONOMICAL
AND
SECURITAL
DILEMMA
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
WHAT
THIS
GUY
MEANS
BUT
THE
SYRIAN
JEWS
ARE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
LEAVE
SYRIA
BECAUSE
ASSAD
WELSHED
ON
HIS
PROMISE
AND
IS
NOT
LETTING
THEM
GO
ISRAEL
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
IT
AS
FOR
THE
OTHER
ARAB
COUNTRIES
THERE
ARE
STILL
SMALL
COMMUNITIES
LEFT
IN
SOME
ARAB
COUNTRIES
MOROCCO
HAS
THE
LARGEST
GROUP
I
THINK
COMPRISING
PERHAPS
JUST
OVER
A
THOUSAND
BUT
I
HAVE
LOST
THE
EXACT
FIGURE
MAYBE
SOMEONE
WILL
BE
SO
KIND
AS
TO
POST
IT
THERE
ARE
COMMUNITIES
LEFT
IN
YEMEN
WHICH
WENT
TO
THE
POLLS
YESTERDAY
IN
WHAT
MIGHT
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
FREEISH
ELECTION
ALGERIA
THIS
IS
A
TINY
GROUP
A
COUPLE
OF
LEFTIST
INTELLECTUALS
I
THINK
OF
COURSE
SYRIA
AND
LEBANNON
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF
THE
DEPARTURE
OF
THE
JEWS
FROM
VARIOUS
ARAB
COUNTRIES
IS
CONTROVERSIAL
IN
SOME
CASES
LIKE
IRAQ
AND
I
DO
NOT
WANT
TO
GET
INTO
A
DISPUTE
ABOUT
IT
EGYPT
EXPELLED
MOST
OF
ITS
COMMUNITY
OUTRIGHT
MOST
OF
THE
FRENCH
NORTH
AFRICAN
JEWS
LEFT
RATHER
THAN
FACE
INDEPENDENCE
I
THINK
THAT
MOROCCANS
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
ENCOURAGED
BY
SOME
ANTISEMITIC
ACTS
BUT
I
AM
NOT
SURE
SOMEONE
ELSE
AROUND
HERE
WILL
KNOW
FOR
SURE
THERE
ARE
CLAIMS
THAT
ISRAELI
INTELLEGENCE
OFFICERS
SPREAD
RUMOURS
AROUND
ALGERIA
THAT
THE
JEWS
WOULD
NOT
BE
WELCOME
BUT
THIS
IS
PROBABLY
JUST
PROPAGANDA
IT
WOULD
TAKE
A
VERY
STUPID
PERSON
NOT
TO
REALISE
THE
BENEFITS
OF
A
MOVE
TO
FRANCE
AS
MOST
DID
OR
TO
ISRAEL
YEMENI
JEWS
WERE
AIRLIFTED
TO
ISRAEL
THOSE
LEFT
WERE
RUMOURED
TO
HAVE
ANOTHER
AIRLIFT
LAST
YEAR
BUT
I
HEARD
NOTHING
ABOUT
IT
SO
I
GUESS
IT
WAS
JUST
A
RUMOUR
ANY
I
LEFT
