RE
FREEDOM
IN

IN
ARTICLE
ANDI
BEYER
WRITES
I
HAVE
JUST
STARTED
READING
THE
ARTICLES
IN
THIS
NEWS
GROUP
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
AN
ATTEMPT
BY
SOME
MEMBERS
TO
QUIET
OTHER
MEMBERS
WITH
SCARE
TACTICS
I
BELIEVE
ONE
POSTING
SAID
THAT
ALL
POSTINGS
BY
ONE
PERSON
ARE
BEING
FORWARDED
TO
HIS
SERVER
WHO
KEEPS
A
FILE
ON
HIM
IN
HOPE
THAT
APPROPRIATE
ACTION
MIGHT
BE
TAKEN
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
YOU
GUYS
ARE
FROM
BUT
IN
AMERICA
SUCH
ATTEMPTS
TO
CURTAIL
SOMEONES
FIRST
AMENDMENT
RIGHTS
ARE
NOT
APPRECIATED
HERE
WE
LET
EVERYONE
SPEAK
THEIR
MIND
REGARDLESS
OF
HOW
WE
FEEL
ABOUT
IT
TAKE
YOUR
FASCISTIC
REPRESSIVE
IDEALS
BACK
TO
WHERE
YOU
CAME
FROM
IT
WOULD
BE
NICE
IF
AS
YOU
RIGHTLY
POINT
OUT
THE
INHERENT
VALUE
OF
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
DISCUSSION
WOULD
ALSO
DEAL
WITH
THE
ALLTO
FREQUENT
RITUALIZED
ABUSES
AND
DISTORTIONS
OF
THAT
FREEDOM
THAT
DO
OCCUR
THERE
ARE
SITUATIONS
WHERE
A
FEW
EXTREMELY
VOCAL
AND
USUALLY
RADICAL
PEOPLE
DO
DRIVE
PEOPLE
AWAY
EFFECTIVELY
STIFLE
ALL
OTHER
OPPOSING
VIEWS
AND
GENERALLY
TAKE
OVER
CLEARLY
THE
PURPOSE
BEHIND
SUCH
ACTIONS
IS
TO
DEPRIVE
OTHERS
OF
THEIR
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
THROUGH
OVERT
AND
COVERT
COERCION
AND
DOMINATION
OF
THE
MEDIA
FORM
IN
QUESTION
WHILE
FREEDOM
OF
SPEECH
IS
TO
BE
VALUED
THIS
IS
NOT
HOW
WOULD
YOU
SUGGEST
THAT
THIS
SORT
OF
REOCCURING
PROBLEM
BE
ALLEVIATED
MORE
PARTICULARLY
HOW
CAN
THIS
BE
CONTROLLED
