RE
ISRAELI
TERRORISM
TCLOCKORIONOACUCIEDU
WRITES
SINCE
ONE
IS
ALSO
UNLIKELY
TO
GET
THE
TRUTH
FROM
EITHER
ARAB
OR
PALESTINIAN
NEWS
OUTLETS
WHERE
DO
WE
GO
TO
UNDERSTAND
TO
LEARN
IS
ONE
FORM
OF
PROPOGANDA
MORE
RELIABLE
THAN
ANOTHER
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
DETERMINE
THAT
IS
TO
TRY
AND
GET
BEYOND
THE
WRITERS
POLITICAL
AGENDA
WHETHER
IT
IS
ON
OR
AGAINST
OUR
SIDE
TIM
FIRST
LET
ME
CORRECT
MYSELF
IN
THAT
IT
WAS
GOERBELS
AND
NOT
GOERING
AIRFORCE
WHO
RAN
THE
NAZI
PROPAGANDA
MACHINE
I
AGREE
THAT
ARAB
NEWS
SOURCES
ARE
ALSO
INHERENTLY
BIASED
BUT
I
BELIEVE
THE
STATEMENT
I
WAS
REACTING
TO
WAS
THAT
SINCE
THE
AMERICAN
ACCOUNTS
OF
EVENTS
ARE
NOT
FULLY
LIKE
THE
ISRAELI
ACCOUNTS
THE
AMERICANS
ARE
BIASED
I
JUST
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
ISRAELIS
HAD
MORE
MOTIVATION
FOR
BIAS
THE
UN
HAS
TRIED
MANY
TIMES
TO
CONDEMN
ISRAEL
FOR
ITS
GROSS
VIOLATION
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
HOWEVER
THE
US
HAS
VETOED
MOST
SUCH
ATTEMPTS
IT
IS
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THE
US
IS
OFTEN
THE
ONLY
COUNTRY
OPPOSING
SUCH
CONDEMNATION
WELL
THE
US
AND
ISRAEL
IT
IS
ALSO
INTERESTING
TO
NOTE
THAT
THAT
MEANS
OTHER
WESTERN
COUNTRIES
REALIZE
THESE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
SO
MAYBE
THERE
ARE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS
GOING
ON
AFTER
ALL
