WRITES
THERE
ARE
ARABS
IN
CABINET
BUT
LOOK
HOW
LONG
IT
TOOK
AND
TO
WHAT
INSIGNIFICANT
POSITIONS
THEY
ARE
ASSIGNED
AND
THIS
IS
BASED
SOLELY
ON
RACE
NOT
POLITICAL
BELIEF
OR
SECURITY
AS
JEWISH
MEMBERS
OF
THE
SAME
PARTY
HAVE
ALWAYS
BEEN
WELCOME
JUST
NOT
THEIR
FELLOW
ARABS
FIRST
OF
ALL
THE
ARAB
STANDING
IN
ANY
PARTY
OR
AS
ANY
PARTY
IS
SOLELY
DEPENDENT
UPON
THE
AMOUNT
OF
POLITICAL
POWER
THEY
CAN
WIELD
EFFECTIVELY
IT
IS
NOT
A
QUESTION
OF
AN
INDIVIDUALS
STANDING
WHEN
A
PARTY
PUTS
UP
AN
ARAB
FOR
A
CABINET
POST
AND
THAT
ARAB
IS
REJECTED
BUT
THE
POSITION
IS
GIVEN
TO
A
JEW
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
WE
ARE
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
POWER
BUT
RACISM
WOULD
YOU
CARE
TO
DENY
THIS
HAS
HAPPENED
ON
SEVERAL
OCCASIONS
WITH
LABOUR
COALITIONS
PLEASE
CITE
SPECIFIC
EXAMPLES
WHERE
AN
ARAB
PARTY
MEMBER
WAS
REJECTED
WHILE
A
JEWISH
PARTY
MEMBER
WAS
ACCEPTED
IF
YOU
EXAMINE
THESE
I
AM
SURE
YOU
WILL
DISCOVER
THAT
THE
ARAB
PARTY
MEMBER
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
POWER
BASE
THAT
HIS
JEWISH
COUNTERPART
HAD
THE
PARTY
STRUCTURE
IN
ISRAEL
HAS
CHANGED
QUITE
A
BIT
INSOFAR
AS
KNESSET
MEMBER
ELECTIONS
GO
KNESSET
MEMBERS
FOR
MOST
PARTIES
ARE
NOW
ELECTED
VIA
PRIMARIES
THE
TOP
STANDING
MEMBERS
END
UP
WITH
CABINET
POSTS
THIS
IS
PURELY
A
POLITICAL
POWER
ISSUE
CHECK
THE
RANKING
OF
ARAB
LABOR
PARTY
MEMBERS
AS
OPPOSED
TO
JEWSIH
MEMBERS
AND
LET
ME
KNOW
WHICH
POSTS
ARE
HELD
BY
JEWS
THAT
RANKED
LOWER
IN
THE
PARTY
THAN
THEIR
ARAB
FELLOW
ELECTEES
ONCE
AGAIN
IF
FOR
ARGUMENTS
SAKE
ALL
THE
ARAB
ISRAELIS
WERE
TO
VOTE
FOR
LABOR
AT
THE
NEXT
ELECTION
YOU
CAN
REST
ASSURED
THAT
THE
NUMBER
OF
ARAB
MKS
AND
CABINET
MEMBERS
WOULD
INCREASE
PROPORTIONATELY
TO
THE
POWER
SHIFT
NOT
THEIR
PARTY
THEM
AS
INDIVIDUALS
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
BELONG
TO
NICE
PEACEFUL
ZIONIST
MAINSTREAM
PARTIES
THEY
ARE
NOT
WELCOME
ARABS
ARE
EXCLUDED
ON
FICITIOUS
SECURITY
GROUNDS
WHICH
ARE
JUST
AN
EXCUSE
IT
SURE
LOOKS
LIKE
RACISM
TO
ME
YOU
ARE
OVERLOOKING
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
WIELD
POLITICAL
POWER
AS
INDIVIDUALS
BASED
UPON
A
WIDER
COLLECTIVE
POWER
BASE
ARABS
ARE
EXCLUDED
FROM
CABINET
EVEN
WHEN
THEY
DO
THE
THINGS
YOU
SUGGEST
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
ARABS
UNLESS
OF
COURSE
YOU
HAVE
A
BETTER
REASON
I
AM
HAPPY
TO
LISTEN
TO
ANY
GOOD
REASON
WHY
A
LEFTIST
JEW
IS
LESS
OF
A
SECURITY
RISK
THAN
A
LEFTIST
ARAB
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
LOOK
AT
THE
PRESENT
CABINET
THE
REASONING
I
SEE
AT
WORK
IS
PURELY
POLITICAL
AS
FAR
AS
SECURITY
GOES
I
THINK
THAT
SOME
SERIOUS
GAFFS
WERE
MADE
BY
RIGHT
WING
JEWS
AS
WELL
EG
SHARON
