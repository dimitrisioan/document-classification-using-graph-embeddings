PERHAPS
THOUGH
ONE
CAN
ARGUE
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THE
CURRENT
PALESTINIAN
DELEGATION
REPRESENTS
THE
PLO
I
WOULD
HOPE
IT
DOES
NOT
AS
THE
PLO
REALLY
DOESNT
HAVE
THAT
KIND
OF
LEGITIMACY
DOES
IT
MATTER
TO
YOU
NAFTALY
ADAM
AND
OTHERS
THAT
ARAFAT
ADVISES
THE
DELEGATION
AND
THAT
THE
PLO
OVERALL
SUPPORTS
IT
DOES
IT
ALSO
MATTER
THAT
ARAFAT
ON
BEHALF
OF
THE
PLO
RECOGNIZES
ISRAEL
AND
ITS
RIGHT
TO
EXIST
FURTHER
DOES
ISRAELS
NEW
POLICY
CONCERNING
DIRECT
NEGOTIATIONS
WITH
THE
PLO
HOLD
ANY
SUBSTANCE
TO
THE
SITUATION
AS
A
WHOLE
NO
HE
DOES
NOT
ARAFAT
EXPLICITLY
DENIES
THIS
CLAIM
FROM
A
LIBYAN
TELEVISON
INTERVIEW
WITH
YASSER
ARAFAT
Q
SOME
PEOPLE
SAY
THAT
THE
PALESTINIAN
REVOLUTION
HAS
MANY
TIMES
CHANGED
ITS
STRATEGIES
AND
TACTICS
SOMETHING
WHICH
HAS
LEFT
ITS
IMPRINT
ON
THE
PALESTINIAN
PROBLEM
AND
ON
THE
PALESTINIAN
LIBERATION
FRONT
THE
STRATEGIES
AND
TACTICS
HAVE
NOT
BEEN
CLEAR
THE
QUESTION
IS
IS
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
PALESTINIAN
PROBLEM
CLEAR
THE
PALESTINIAN
LEADERSHIP
HAS
STOPPED
OR
AT
LEAST
THIS
IS
WHAT
HAS
BEEN
SAID
IN
THE
MEDIA
THIS
HAPPENED
ON
THE
WAY
TO
THE
DIALOGUE
WITH
THE
UNITED
STATES
THE
PLO
RECOGNIZED
SOMETHING
CALLED
ISRAEL
A
NO
NO
NO
WE
DO
NOT
RECOGNIZE
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
WE
SAID
RECOGNITION
WHEN
A
PALESTINIAN
STATE
IS
ESTABLISHED
IT
WILL
THEN
DECIDE
IF
TO
RECOGNIZE
ISRAEL
OR
NOT
WHEN
IT
IS
ESTABLISHED
ITS
PARLIAMENT
WILL
CONVENE
AND
DECIDE
POLICIES
WHICH
IT
CAN
JUSTIFY
THROUGH
OCCUPATION
BECAUSE
OF
THIS
YOU
HAVE
THE
GRASSROOT
MOVEMENTS
THAT
REJECT
ISRAELS
AUTHORITY
AND
DISREGARD
FOR
HUMAN
RIGHTS
AND
IF
ISRAEL
WAS
SERIOUS
ABOUT
PEACE
IT
WOULD
ABANDON
THESE
POLICIES
AND
REPLACE
THEM
WITH
WHAT
IF
ISRAEL
IS
TO
WITHDRAW
ITS
CONTROL
OF
ANY
TERRITORY
THERE
MUST
BE
TWO
PREREQUSITES
ONE
IS
THAT
IT
LEADS
TO
A
REDUCTION
IN
DEATHS
THE
SECOND
IS
THAT
IT
SHOULD
NOT
WEAKEN
ISRAELS
BARGIANING
POSITION
WITH
RESPECT
TO
PEACE
TALKS
LEAVING
GAZA
UNILATERALY
IS
A
BAD
IDEA
BECAUSE
IT
ENCOURAGES
ARABS
TO
THINK
THEY
CAN
GET
WHAT
THEY
WANT
BY
KILLING
JEWS
THE
ONLY
WAY
ISRAEL
SHOULD
PULL
OUT
OF
GAZA
IS
AT
THE
END
OF
NEGOTIATIONS
THESE
NEGOTIATIONS
SHOULD
LEAD
TO
A
MUTUALLY
AGREEABLE
SOLUTION
WITH
SECURITY
GUARANTEES
FOR
BOTH
SIDES
UNTIL
ARABS
ARE
READY
TO
SIT
DOWN
AT
THE
TABLE
AND
TALK
AGAIN
THEY
SHOULD
NOT
EXPECT
OR
RECIEVE
MORE
CONCESSIONS
