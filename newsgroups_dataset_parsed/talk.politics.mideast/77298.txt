WRITES
THUS
WHILE
A
WAR
RAGES
BETWEEN
SERBS
AND
CROATS
AS
A
CONTINUATION
OF
WWII
AND
OLDER
AGENDA
THE
ANNIHILATION
OF
ISLAM
AND
MUSLIMS
FROM
BOSNIAN
IS
BEING
CARRIED
OUT
UNDER
THE
COVER
OF
THE
SERBOCROAT
WAR
THE
ANNIHILATION
OF
ISLAM
TURKS
IS
AN
OLDER
SERBIAN
AGENDA
BUT
I
STRONGLY
DISPUTE
YOUR
NOTION
THAT
CROATS
HAD
A
SIMILAR
OLDER
AGENDA
IN
FACT
FOR
THE
PAST
CENTURY
OR
TWO
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
HAVE
SEEN
THEMSELVES
AS
HAVING
A
LOT
IN
COMMON
AND
THEY
GENERALLY
HAD
FRIENDLY
RELATIONS
YOUR
SUGGESTION
THAT
CROATMUSLIM
RELATIONSHIP
IS
ANYTHING
LIKE
SERBMUSLIM
RELATIONSHIP
IS
COMPLETELY
WRONG
TO
SAY
THAT
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
HAVE
A
LOT
IN
COMMON
DOES
NOT
IMPLY
THEY
ARE
NOT
SEPARATE
PEOPLES
THE
EVENTS
OF
THE
PAST
TWO
YEARS
CLEARLY
SHOW
MUSLIM
DETERMINATION
TO
REMAIN
SEPARATE
IN
THEIR
ALLIANCE
WITH
CROATS
THEY
MAINTAINED
THIS
SEPARATION
CROATS
WOULD
HAVE
ACCEPTED
A
MUCH
CLOSER
RELATIONSHIP
I
THINK
THIS
CENTURY
PLUS
OF
BUILDING
BRIDGES
BETWEEN
THESE
TWO
FRIENDLY
PEOPLES
IS
NOW
AT
RISK
BECAUSE
OF
THE
INEXORABLE
LOGIC
OF
WAR
SINCE
BOSNIAN
SERBS
OF
POPULATION
HAVE
TIMES
MORE
HEAVY
WEAPONS
THAN
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
AND
CROATS
COMBINED
THEY
HAVE
SQUEEZED
MUSLIMS
AND
CROATS
INTO
ONLY
OF
THE
TERRITORY
MUSLIMS
LOST
MORE
TERRITORY
THAN
CROATS
WHO
BUILT
DEFENSES
EARLY
ON
UNDER
THESE
CONDITIONS
ANY
ALLIANCE
IS
BOUND
TO
FALL
APART
SINCE
IT
IS
EASIER
TO
RECOVER
LOST
LAND
FROM
CROATS
THAN
FROM
SERBS
THE
ONLY
THING
KEEPING
THIS
IN
CHECK
WAS
THE
HOPE
OF
REVERSAL
OF
FORTUNES
THROUGH
FOREIGN
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
AND
LIFTING
OF
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
SINCE
WARREN
CHRISTOPHER
HAD
NO
LUCK
PERSUADING
THE
EUROPEANS
TO
GO
ALONG
WITH
THIS
THIS
HOPE
WAS
DASHED
HAVING
NO
PROSPECT
OF
OUTSIDE
HELP
THE
FORMER
ALLIES
TURNED
ON
EACH
OTHER
LIKE
TWO
STARVED
ANIMALS
IN
A
TIGHT
CAGE
THIS
INEXORABLE
LOGIC
OF
COURSE
GOT
PLENTY
OF
HELP
FROM
SERBIAN
INTELLIGENCE
OPERATIVES
WHO
WERE
DOING
EVERYTHING
TO
BUILD
MISTRUST
BETWEEN
CROATS
AND
MUSLIMS
FOR
OVER
A
YEAR
A
TIMELY
INTERVENTION
TO
STOP
SERBIAN
AGGRESSION
WOULD
HAVE
PREVENTED
THIS
SADLY
NOTHING
WAS
DONE
TO
CREATE
A
BALANCE
OF
POWER
ON
THE
GROUND
AS
LONG
AS
THE
SERBS
ENJOY
ADVANTAGE
THEY
CAN
BREAK
ANY
ALLIANCE
EVEN
AMONG
FRIENDS
THIS
IS
TRAGIC
BUT
HARDLY
NEW
DIVIDE
ET
IMPERA
WAS
USED
BY
ANCIENT
ROMANS
WITH
SUCCESS
IN
MY
VIEW
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
AND
CROATS
MANAGED
TO
RESIST
THIS
DIVISIVE
STRATEGY
REASONABLY
WELL
UNTIL
MAY
WHEN
THE
HOPE
OF
REVERSAL
OF
FORTUNES
WAS
LOST
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
FOR
THE
DISTINGUISHED
DIPLOMATS
DO
THEY
BELIEVE
BALKAN
PEOPLES
ARE
EXPERIMENTAL
CANNON
FODDER
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHAT
DID
THEY
EXPECT
WHEN
THEY
DECIDED
TO
ENFORCE
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
WHICH
SOLIDIFIED
SERBIAN
ADVANTAGE
IN
HEAVY
WEAPONS
HOW
DID
THEY
EXPECT
TO
PREVENT
FRAGMENTATION
OF
THE
MUSLIM
AND
CROAT
DEFENSE
FORCES
AND
HOW
ON
EARTH
DO
THEY
HOPE
TO
RESTORE
PEACE
WITHOUT
JUSTICE
THE
IMPLICATIONS
OF
THIS
IMMORAL
APPROACH
I
CANNOT
BEGIN
TO
PREDICT
BUT
I
AM
FILLED
WITH
FOREBODING
SINCERELY
