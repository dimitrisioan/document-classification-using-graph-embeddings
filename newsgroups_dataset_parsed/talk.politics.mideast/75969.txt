WRITES
THEM
BY
THE
WAY
I
DO
NOT
APPLAUD
THE
KILLING
OF
ANY
HUMAN
BEING
INCLUDING
PRISONERS
SENTENCED
TO

BY
OUR
ILLUSTRIOUS
JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT
PEACE
MARC
BOY
YOU
REALLY
ARE
A
STUPID
PERSON
OUR
JUSTICE
DEPARTMENT
DOES
NOT
SENTENCE
PEOPLE
TO
DEATH
THATS
UP
TO
STATE
COURTS
AGAIN
GET
A
BRAIN
PETER
I
THINK
YOU
ARE
RIDICULOUS
HERE
STUPIDITY
IS
NOT
A
MEASURE
OF
HOW
WELL
SOMEONE
KNOWS
OUR
JUDICIAL
SYSTEM
I
GUESS
MARC
MEANT
THAT
HE
IS
AGAINST
DEATH
PENALTY
BUT
NO
MATTER
WHAT
HE
MEANT
YOUR
STATEMENT
NOT
JUSTIFIED
REGARDS
