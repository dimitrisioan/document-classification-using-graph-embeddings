THE
TWO
BIGGEST

ARE

THEREFORE
THE
BELT
OF

AROUND
THE

HIGHWAY
DESIGNED
TO
SEPARATE
THOSE
ENCLAVES
FROM

OTHER
IS
OF
PARAMOUNT
IMPORTANCE
ACCORDING
TO
THE
LATEST

THE
PERCENTAGE
OF
ISRAELI
SETTLERS
IN
THE
ENTIRE
WEST

POPULATION
APART
FROM

JERUSALEM
IS
A

FOR

THE

IS

STEADILY
THE

SOUTH
OF

DESIGNED

THE

THE

THE

IS
COSTLY
IN

BECAUSE

BY

THE

WAS
SUSPENDED
UNTIL

RETURN

VISIT
IN

THE
SUBSEQUENT

CAN

IN

HERMETICALLY

ALL

COULD
BE
BARRED
FROM

ISRAELEVEN
THOUGH
ACCURATE

IS
HARD
TO
COME
BY
IT
IS
INDISPUTABLE
THAT
DURING
THE
LAST
TWO
YEARS
THE
NUMBES
OF
GAZAN
WORKERS
ARRIVING
DAILY
TO
WORK
IN
ISRAEL
HAS
MARKEDLY
DECREASED
FROM
IN
THE
TO
TODAY
BUT
THE
DECREASE
IS
NOT
ONLY
DUE
TO
RESTRICTIONS
IMPOSED
ON
ENTERING
ISRAEL
FROM

IT
IS
ALSO
DUE
TO
THE
DRASTIC
CURTAILMENT
OF

FOR

THE

OF

IS
TOTALLY

IN

IN

THERE
HAS
BEEN
AN

IN

CAN
BE
NO

THAT

OF
THE
REASONS
FOR

HAVE
BEEN
SET
IN

FOR
PURPOSES
OF
FREEING

FROM
THE
THREAT
OF

THE
METHOD
IS
SIMPLICITY
ITSELF
AS
SOON
AS
ANY
ISRAELI

SUCCEEDS
IN
PERSUADING
THE

OR
EVEN
THE

OF

PERPETUARING

GOAL
IS
TO
PERPETUATE
THIS

THE

GOAL
IS
SHARED
BY
THE
US
WHICH
OTHERWISE
COULD
NOT
SUPPORT
THE
LABOUR
GOVERNMENT
SO
FIRMLY
IN
MY
VIEW
ONE
OF
THE
REASONS
THE
US
FEELS
HAPPIER
ABOUT
SUPPORTING
LABOUR
THAN
LIKUD
IS
ITS
GREATER
EFFICIENCY
IN
PURSUING
THE

DRIVE
THIS
POINT
WAS
BROUGHT

BY
OFER
SHELAH
IN
MAARIV
WHO
DEPLORED
THE

WHICH
HE
ATTRIBUTED
TO

HE
SHOWED
THAT
THE
PEAK

OCCURED
DURING

IN

THAN

IS

ATTRIBUTABLE

REASONS
TO
SUM

UNCONDITIONALLY
SUPPORTED
BY
THE
US
DIFFERS
FROM
THAT
OF

PRIMARILY
IN
THE
EFFICIENCY
WITH
WHICH
IT
IS
IMPLEMENTED
ACCORDING
TO
THAT
POLICY
THE
TERRITORIES
ARE
TO
BE
DIVIDED
INTO
TWO
PARTS
THE
MAJOR
PART
IS
TO
BE
RULED
BY
ISRAEL
DIRECTLY
AND
THE
MINOR
PART
INDIRECTLY
IN
MY
VIEW
THIS
RACIST
SCHEME
IS
DOOMED
TO
ULTIMATELY
FAIL
BUT
AT
A
HORRIFYING
PRICE
IN
HUMAN
SUFFERING
THE
SOONER
ITS
TRUE
NATURE
IS
RECOGNISED

LESS
SUFFERING
IT
MAY
CAUSE
