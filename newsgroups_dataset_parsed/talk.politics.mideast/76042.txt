AGAIN
ARMENIANS
IN

ARE
SIMPLY
DEFENDING

YOU
ARMENIA
DOESNT
NEED
ANYONE
TO
DRAG
HER
INTO
THE
CONFLICT
IT
BM
IS
A
PART
OF
IT
HENRIK
ARMENIANS
KNEW
FROM
THE
BEGINING
THAT
TURKS
WERE
FULLY
ENGAGED
HENRIK
TRAINING
AZERIS
MILITARILY
TO
FIGHT
AGAINST
KARABAKHIARMENIANS
SO
SHOULD
I
AT
THIS
POINT
BREAK
INTO
CAPS
AND
START
TALKING
ABOUT
DEFENSE
ETC
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
FULLY
ENGAGED
TURKEY
ISWAS
THOUGH
HENRIK
THE
KARABAKHIARMENIANS
WHO
HAVE
LIVED
IN
THEIR
HOMELAND
FOR
HENRIK
YEARS
CUT
OFF
FROM
ARMENIA
AND
GIVEN
TO
AZERIS
BY
STALIN
ARE
THE
HENRIK
ONES
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CONFLICT
THEY
ARE
DEFENDING
HENRIK
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
AZERI
AGGRESSION
BM
HUH
YOU
DIDNT
EXPECT
AZERIS
TO
BE
FRIENDLY
TO
FORCES
FIGHTING
WITH
THEM
BM
WITHIN
THEIR
BORDERS
HENRIK
WELL
HISTORY
IS
SAD
REMEMBER
THOSE
ARE
RELOCATED
AZERIS
INTO
HENRIK
THE
ARMENIAN
LAND
OF
KARABAKH
BY
THE
STALIN
REGIME
SO
I
HEAR
THIS
JUSTIFIES
BLOODSHED
N
YEARS
AFTER
THE
FACT
HENRIK
AT
LAST
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
US
INSISTS
THAT
TURKEY
STAY
OUT
OF
THE
HENRIK
KARABAKH
CRISIS
SO
THAT
THE
REPEAT
OF
THE
CYPRUS
INVASION
WILL
NEVER
HENRIK
OCCUR
AGAIN
BM
YOURE
NOT
PLAYING
WITH
A
FULL
DECK
ARE
YOU
WHERE
WOULD
TURKEY
INVADE
HENRIK
IT
IS
NOT
UP
TO
ME
TO
SPECULATE
BUT
I
AM
SURE
TURKEY
WOULD
HAVE
STEPPED
HENRIK
INTO
ARMENIA
IF
SHE
COULD
WHY
WOULD
TURKEY
DO
THAT
DO
YOU
NOT
REALIZE
THAT
THIS
IS
A
LOCAL
CLASH
THAT
TURKEY
NEVER
WISHED
TO
SEE
HAPPEN
TURKEY
HAS
OTHER
PLANS
FOR
REGION
LIKE
ECONOMIC
REVIVAL
COOPERATION
ETC
GOOD
STUFF
IN
OTHER
WORDS
ID
BE
HAPPY
TO
BICKER
WITH
ARMENIANS
OVER
TRADE
BARRIERS
AND
SUCH
ON
USENET
RATHER
THAN
WHO
KILLED
WHOM
IN
WHAT
WAY
WHICH
I
DETEST
DOING
AND
WOULDNT
DO
BM
ARE
YOU
THROWING
THE
CYPRUS
BUZZWORD
AROUND
WITH
SCG
IN
THE
HEADER
BM
IN
HOPES
THAT
THE
GREEK
NETTERS
WILL
JUMP
THE
GUN
HENRIK
ABSOLUTELY
NOT
I
AM
MERELY
TRYING
TO
EMPHASIZE
THAT
IN
MANY
HENRIK
CASES
HISTORY
REPEATS
ITSELF
EVEN
IF
ONE
BUYS
INTO
YOUR
IMPLICIT
PREMISE
THE
SANE
THING
TO
DO
WOULD
BE
TO
TRY
NOT
TO
PROVOKE
TURKEY
AS
WAS
DONE
IN
IF
THERED
BEEN
A
DEMOCRATIC
GOVERNMENT
INSTEAD
OF
A
BUNCH
OF
IDIOTS
IN
ATHENS
AT
THE
TIME
EVERYBODY
WOULD
HAVE
STAYED
HOME
WITH
THEIR
FAMILIES
I
HAVE
NO
WISH
TO
GO
INTO
THE
CYPRUS
QUARREL
BUT
I
SUSPECT
WHAT
IVE
SAID
IS
NOT
ONLY
ACCURATE
BUT
ALSO
PALATABLE
TO
ALL
PARTIES
INVOLVED
BM
YES
INDEED
TURKEY
HAS
THE
MILITARY
PROWESS
TO
INTERVENE
WHAT
SHE
WISHES
BM
SHE
HAD
HOWEVER
IS
THE
DIPLOMATIC
POWER
TO
STOP
THE
HOSTILITIES
AND
BRING
BM
THE
PARTIES
TO
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
THATS
HARD
TO
DO
WHEN
ARMENIANS
BM
ARE
ATTACKING
AZERI
TOWNS
HENRIK
SO
LET
ME
UNDERSTAND
IN
PLAIN
WORDS
WHAT
YOU
ARE
SAYING
TURKEY
HENRIK
WANTS
A
PEACEFUL
END
TO
THIS
CONFLICT
NOT
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
THINK
WE
WANT
WAR
DEATH
AND
DESTRUCTION
HENRIK
I
WILL
BELIEVE
IT
WHEN
I
SEE
IT
NO
IF
YOU
ALLOW
YOURSELF
TO
BELIEVE
IT
YOU
JUST
MIGHT
SEE
IT
HENRIK
NOW
AS
FAR
AS
ATTACKING
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
WHEN
YOU
SEE
A
GUN
POINTING
HENRIKTO
YOUR
HEAD
DO
YOU
SIT
THERE
AND
WATCH
OR
DEFEND
YOURSEFFAT
CHANCE
THIS
KIND
OF
CHILDISH
RHETORIC
DOESNT
HELP
ANTHING
HENRIK
DO
YOU
REMEMBER
WHAT
AZERIS
DID
TO
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
BAKU
ALL
THE
HENRIK
BARBERIAN
ACTS
ESPECIALLY
AGAINST
MOTHERS
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
I
MEAN
HENRIK
BURNING
PEOPLE
ALIVE
NOW
SOME
AZERI
WILL
COME
OUT
AND
GIVE
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
SIMILAR
STUFF
PERPETRATED
BY
ARMENIANS
ONE
SHOULD
REHASH
STUFF
LIKE
THIS
OFTEN
TO
KEEP
THE
HATRED
ALIVE
RIGHT
BM
ARMENIAN
LEADERS
ARE
LACKING
THE
STATESMANSHIP
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
BMFUTILITY
OF
ARMED
CONFLICT
AND
CONVINCE
THEIR
NATION
THAT
A
COMPROMISE
THAT
BM
LEADS
TO
STABILITY
IS
MUCH
BETTER
THAN
A
MILITARY
FAITS
ACCOMPLIS
THATS
BM
GOING
TO
CAUSE
INCESSANT
SKIRMISHES
HENRIK
ARMENIANS
IN
KARABAKH
WANT
PEACE
AND
THEIR
OWN
REPUBLIC
THEY
ARE
HENRIK
NOT
ASKING
MUCH
THEY
SIMPLY
WANT
TO
GET
BACK
WHAT
WAS
TAKEN
AWAY
HENRIK
FROM
THEM
AND
GIVEN
TO
AZERIS
BY
STALIN
WELL
THEY
OBVIOUSLY
ARENT
GETTING
ANYWHERE
WITH
THEIR
CURRENT
METHODS
OF
ASKING
NOT
VERY
PEACEFUL
ID
SAY
BM
THINK
OF
OR
YEARS
DOWN
THE
LINE
BOTH
OF
THE
NEWLY
INDEPENDENT
BM
COUNTRIES
NEED
TO
DEVELOP
ECONOMICALLY
AND
NEITHER
ONE
IS
GOING
TO
WIPE
BM
THE
OTHER
OUT
THESE
PEOPLE
WILL
BE
NEIGHBORS
WOULD
IT
NOT
BE
BETTER
BM
TO
KEEP
THE
BAD
BLOOD
BETWEEN
THEM
MINIMAL
HENRIK
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
ALSO
WANT
PEACEFUL
SOLUTION
TO
THE
HENRIK
CONFLICT
BUT
UNTIL
AZERIS
REALIZE
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
HENRIK
KARABAKH
WILL
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
AGGRESION
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
YOU
WANT
A
SOLUTION
OR
JUST
WANT
TO
EXCHANGE
SLOGANS
PEACE
ISNT
WHATS
HAPPENING
RIGHT
NOW
FURTHERMORE
WHATS
HAPPENING
RIGHT
NOW
ISNT
CONDUSIVE
TO
PEACE
YOU
CAN
SPEND
DAYS
AND
NIGHTS
RAVING
ABOUT
HOW
RIGHT
THE
ARMENIAN
POSITION
IS
AND
IM
SURE
THERELL
BE
OTHERS
WHOD
BE
HAPPY
TO
TALK
TO
YOU
BY
ARGUING
THE
OTHER
SIDE
IF
ENTRENCHED
POSITIONS
LEAD
TO
WAR
AND
IF
PEOPLE
WANT
PEACE
THAN
THEY
SHOULD
SIT
DOWN
AND
TALK
ABOUT
A
COMPROMISE
ARMENIA
ISNT
STRONG
ENOUGH
TO
EXERCISE
THE
WE
THINK
WERE
RIGHT
AND
WE
HAVE
THE
BOMBS
SO
WELL
DO
WHATEVER
WE
WANT
SO
THERE
STYLE
OF
FOREIGN
RELATIONS
YES
YOU
CAN
TYPE
STALIN
IN
CAPS
AND
GIVE
ONE
SIDED
ATROCITY
STORIES
ETC
BUT
FOR
PEACE
YOU
NEED
TO
BE
WILLING
TO
TALK
TO
THE
OTHER
SIDE
YOU
PERSONALLY
CAN
CHOOSE
NOT
TO
DO
THAT
OF
COURSE
THIS
BEING
JUST
USENET
THE
PEOPLE
IN
POWER
SHOULDNT
BE
SO
CHILDISH
BM
IF
YOU
BELONG
TO
THE
ARMENIAN
DIASPORA
KEEP
IN
MIND
THAT
WHAT
STRIKES
BM
YOUR
FANCY
ON
THE
MAP
IS
COSTING
THE
LOCAL
ARMENIANS
DEARLY
IN
TERMS
OF
BM
THEIR
BLOOD
AND
FUTURE
HENRIK
AGAIN
YOU
ARE
TAKING
DIFFERENT
TURNS
ARMENIA
HAS
NO
INTENSION
HENRIK
TO
GRAB
ANY
LAND
FROM
AZERBAIJAN
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
KARABAKH
HENRIK
ARE
SIMPLY
DEFENDING
THEMSELVES
UNTIL
A
SOLUTION
IS
SET
AZERIS
WOULD
DISAGREE
WITH
YOU
ON
THIS
AND
THE
MAPS
IVE
SEEN
SUPPORT
WHAT
THEYD
BE
SAYING
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
LIKELY
THAT
A
SOLUTION
WILL
BE
REACHED
IN
THIS
MANNER
BM
ITS
EASY
TO
BE
COMFORTABLE
ABROAD
AND
PROPAGANDIZE
BM
CRAZINESS
TO
HAVE
YOUR
FEELINGS
ABOUT
TURKS
TICKLED
THE
ARMENIANS
BM
IN
ARMENIA
AND
NK
WILL
BE
THERE
WITH
THE
SAME
PEOPLE
YOU
SEEM
TO
HATE

AS
THEIR

FOR
MAYBE
YEARS
MORE
THE
SOONER
THERES
PEACE
IN

THE
REGION
THE
BETTER
IT
IS
FOR
THEM
AND
EVERYONE

INFLAMMATORY
HALFTRUTHS
HENRIK
IT
IS
NOT
UP

TO
DECIDE
THE
PEACE
INITIATIVE
I
AM
ABSOLUTELY
HENRIK
FOR
IT
IT
DIDNT
LOOK
IT
WHEN
I
READ
YOUR
POSTING
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
THAT
IF
YOU
CAN
SPEW
MISINFORMATION
ABOUT
A
BOOGEYMAN
YOU
CAN
ALSO
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
ONE
MIGHT
AVOID
THE
NASTINESS
FAIR
HENRIK
BUT
IN
THE
MEANTIME
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
TAKE
CARE
OF
YOURSELF
HENRIK
YOU
WILL
BE
WIPED
OUT
SUCH
AS
THE
CASE
IN
THE
ERA
OF
OF
HENRIK
THE
ARMENIAN
MASSACRES
YOU
DONT
REALIZE
I
CAN
SAY
THE
SAME
THING
ABOUT
THE
TURKISH
MASSACRES
YES
BOYS
AND
GIRLS
LETS
ALWAYS
TALK
ABOUT
HOW
BAD
AND
NASTY
THINGS
