come
again
the
imageconscious
armenians
sorely
feel
a
missing
glory
in
their
background
armenians
have
never
achieved
statehood
and
independence
they
have
always
been
subservient
and
engaged
in
undermining
schemes
against
their
rulers
they
committed
genocide
against
the
muslim
populations
of
eastern
anatolia
and
xsoviet
armenia
before
and
during
world
war
i
and
fully
participated
in
the
extermination
of
the
european
jewry
during
world
war
ii
belligerence
genocide
backstabbing
rebelliousness
and
disloyalty
have
been
the
hallmarks
of
the
armenian
history
to
obliterate
these
episodes
the
armenians
engaged
in
tailoring
history
to
suit
their
whims
in
this
zeal
they
tried
to
cover
up
the
coldblooded
genocide
of
million

have
had
many

in

ignorance

of
most

sarkis
atamian
explains
in
his
book
called
the
armenian
community
new
york
philosophical
library
that
according
to
historians
original
fatherland
of
the
armenians
was
in
thessaly
greece
armenian
invaders
burned
and
sacked
the
fatherland
of
urartus
massacred
and
exterminated
its
population
and
presented
to
the
world
all
those
left
from
the
urartus
as
the
armenian
civilization
all
reliable
western
historians
describe
how
armenians
ruthlessly
exterminated
million
muslim
women
children
and
elderly
people
of
eastern
anatolia
and
how
they
collaborated
with
the
enemies
of
the
muslim
people
between
it
is
unfortunately
a
truth
that
armenians
are
known
as
collaborators
of
the
nazis
during
world
war
ii
and
that
even
today
criminal
members
of

preach

instigate
racism
hatred
violence
and
terrorism
among

please
tell
me
how
on
earth
armenians
fully
participated
in
the
genocide
of
jews
during
wwii
are
you
on
some
heavy
drugs
who
says
arromdians
are
no
damn
good
during
world
war
ii
armenians
were
carried
away
with
the
german
might
and
cringing
and
fawning
over
the
nazis
in
that
zeal
the
armenian
publication
in
germany
hairenik
carried
statements
as
sometimes
it
is
difficult
to
eradicate
these
poisonous
elements
the
jews
when
they
have
struck
deep
root
like
a
chronic
disease
and
when
it
becomes
necessary
for
a
people
the
nazis
to
eradicate
them
in
an
uncommon
method
these
attempts
are
regarded
as
revolutionary
during
the
surgical
operation
the
flow
of

is
a
natural
