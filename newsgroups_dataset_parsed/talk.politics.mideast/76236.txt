DEAR
MR
AJAMI
I
HAVE
READ
JUST
TODAY
TWO
ARTICLES
DRIPPING
OF
HATE
AND
OFFENCE
TO
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
PEOPLE
I
COULD
FIND
AS
MUCH
MATCHING
HATRED
IN
YOUR
ARTICLES
AS
I
HAVE
FOUND
IN
SOME
OF
THE
SELFRIGHTEOUS
KILLINTHENAME
OF
GOD
PEOPLE
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
YOU
ARE
SO
ATTCAKING
TO
EVERYONE
IS
IT
A
REACTION
TO
THE
HATRED
CALLS
ON
THIS
NEWSGROUP
OR
IS
IT
A
REACTION
TO
HARDSHIPS
YOU
HAVE
SEEN
AND
EXPERIENCED
FROM
BEFORE
I
HAVE
LEARNT
NOT
TO
JUDGE
PEOPLE
BY
ONLY
WHAT
THEY
SAY
BUT
RATHER
TRY
TO
PUT
MYSELF
IN
THEIR
PLACE
AND
ASPIRE
TO
UNDERSTAND
THEIR
FEELINGS
I
HOPE
YOU
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
THE
SAME
WITH
EVERYONE
STARTING
BY
YOUR
OWNSELF
BECAUSE
ONLY
THROUGH
THAT
YOU
COULD
BE
ABLE
TO
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
FEELINGS
AND
ACT
IN
A
THE
MANNER
YOU
WOULD
ASPIRE
EVERYONE
TO
ADOPT
THANKS
FOR
YOUR
TIME
NABIL
