SID
BALMAN
JR
WRITES
WASHINGTON
UPI
SECRETARY
OF
STATE
WARREN
CHRISTOPHER
SAID
TUESDAY
THERE
ARE
BETTER
IDEAS
TO
STOP
THE
HUMAN
SLAUGHTER
IN
THE
BALKANS
THAN
ORDERING
AMERICAN
FIGHTERS
TO
BOMB
THE
SERBS
BUT
A
FRUSTRATED
SENATOR
TOLD
HIM
TO
DO
JUST
THAT
WEVE
NOT
DONE
A
DAMN
THING
SEN
JOSEPH
BIDEN
DDEL
TOLD
CHRISTOPHER
AT
A
HEARING
OF
THE
SENATE
FOREIGN
RELATIONS
COMMITTEE
PREVENTIVE
DIPLOMACY
IS
NOT
IN
YOUR
CAPABILITY
RIGHT
NOW
IN
BOSNIA
HERZEGOVINA
BIDEN
CHASTISED
THE
ADMINISTRATION
AND
ITS
REPUBLICAN
PREDECESSOR
FOR
WHAT
HE
CHARACTERIZED
AS
A
LIMP
RESPONSE
TO
THE
SERBIAN
POLICY
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
OF
MUSLIMS
INCLUDING
RAPE
AND
SHELLING
OF
CIVILIANS
THE
TIME
HAS
COME
FOR
US
AND
THE
WORLD
TO
STOP
BEMOANING
THE
FACT
THAT
ALL
THE
OPTIONS
ARE
BAD
ONES
BIDEN
SAID
THEY
ARE
ALL
BAD
ONES
AND
WE
OUGHT
TO
PICK
A
COUPLE
BIDEN
ALSO
ENDORSED
LIFTING
AN
INTERNATIONAL
ARMS
EMBARGO
AGAINST
THE
FORMER
YUGOSLAVIA
SO
THE
MUSLIMDOMINATED
BOSNIAN
GOVERNMENT
MIGHT
HAVE
A
CHANCE
TO
AT
LEAST
DEFEND
ITSELF
AGAINST
THE
SERBS
CHRISTOPHER
SAID
THIS
COULD
GIVE
AN
OPENING
ROLE
IN
THE
CONFLICT
TO
THE
RADICAL
ISLAMIC
GOVERNMENT
OF
IRAN
O
I
C
BIDEN
ENDORSED
BOMBING
SERBIAN
HEAVY
WEAPONS
AROUND
THE
BESIEGED
EASTERN
TOWN
OF
SREBRENICA
THERES
NOT
A
MILITARY
PERSONWHO
WILL
NOT
TELL
YOU
THAT
THEY
COULD
TODAY
IF
YOU
GAVE
THEM
THE
ORDER
TAKE
OUT
THE
HEAVY
WEAPONRY
AROUND
SREBRENICA
BIDEN
SAID
IF
YOU
DID
NOTHING
ELSE
NOTHING
ELSE
BUT
THAT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
SAVED
HUNDREDS
OF
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
WHO
ARE
BEING
ABSOLUTELY
MASSACRED
RIGHT
NOW
MILITARY
ACTION
IS
THE
ONLY
THING
THATS
GOING
TO
CHANGE
THE
EQUATION
BIDEN
SAID
DESPITE
THE
FRUSTRATIONS
AND
PRESSURE
CHRISTOPHER
HAD
NO
ENTHUSIASM
FOR
AMERICAN
COMBAT
AIRCRAFT
TO
STRIKE
SERB
POSITIONS
IN
BOSNIA
HERZEGOVINA
CLEARLY
WE
ARE
AT
A
TURNING
POINT
IN
THE
BOSNIA
SITUATION
CHRISTOPHER
SAID
AIR
STRIKES
ARE
AMONG
THOSE
STEPS
THAT
ARE
SO
COMPLEX
BECAUSE
THEY
TEND
TO
INTERFERE
WITH
THE
HUMANITARIAN
ENDEAVOURS
I
THINK
THERE
MAY
BE
BETTER
OPTIONS
HUMANITARIAN
AS
IN
FEEDING
THEM
AND
LET
THEM
GET
RAPED
AND
KILLED
POLITICAL
CONFLICT
CLINTON
VOWED
DURING
THE
PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN
TO
THEN
LIFT
THE
ARMS
EMBARGO
AND
TO
STRIKE
AT
SERBIAN
HEAVY
WEAPONS
WITH
US
COMBAT
AIRCRAFT
CHRISTOPHER
SAID
AIRSTRIKES
WOULD
LIKELY
INCREASE
THE
LEVEL
OF
NOW
FIGHTING
AND
CAUSE
OUR
ALLIES
TO
DRAW
BACK
OR
EVEN
PULL
OUT
THE
HUMANITARIAN
EFFORT
GREAT
BRITAIN
AND
FRANCE
HAVE
BALKED
AT
FOREIGN
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
IN
BOSNIAHERZEGOVINA
FOR
FEAR
THAT
THEIR
PEACEKEEPING
TROOPS
ON
THE
GROUND
MAY
SUFFER
SERBIAN
RETRIBUTION
WHY
DONT
THEY
GET
THE
HELL
OUT
OF
THERE
THEY
ARED
DOING
NOTHING
TO
PROTECT
THE
VICTIMS
ANYWAY
MAYBE
BECASUE
THEY
HAVE
A
DIFFERENT
AGENDA
SEN
NANCY
KASSEBAUM
RKAN
SEEMED
TO
AGREE
WITH
CHRISTOPHERS
ASSESSMENT
AND
STRESSED
THE
NEED
NOT
TO
BUILD
UP
BOSNIAN
EXPECTATIONS
FOR
HEAVY
US
MILITARY
INTERVENTION
ITS
VERY
IMPORTANT
THAT
EXPECTATIONS
ARENT
RAISED
HIGH
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
BELEAGURED
BOSNIANS
SHE
SAID
AIR
STRIKES
MIGHT
HAVE
MADE
A
DIFFERENCE
EIGHT
MONTHS
AGO
SHE
SAID
BUT
THE
STRATEGIC
SIGNIFICANCE
OF
THAT
STEP
NOW
IS
QUESTIONABLE
LIKE
CHRISTOPHER
KASSEBAUM
SAID
IT
MIGHT
JEOPARDIZE
THE
HUMANITARIAN
RELIEF
EFFORT
NOW
THAT
THEY
MADE
SURE
THE
BOSNIAN
WHO
WERE
THE
ONLY
REAL
SUBJECT
OF
THE
EMBARGO
LAST
YEAR
AS
EVERYBODY
KNOWS
THAT
THE
SERBS
HAD
AN
UNLIMITED
SUPPLY
OF
ARMS
WRE
MASSACRED
WITHOUT
HAVING
A
CHANCE
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
NOW
THIS
EVIL
COLDHEARTED
SNAKE
IS
SAYING
IT
IS
TOO
LATE
TO
SAVE
THEM
SO
LET
THEM
DIE
