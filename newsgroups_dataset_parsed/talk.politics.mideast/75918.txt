all
i
did
was
to
translate
a
few
lines
from
turkish
into
english
if
it
was
so
embarrassing

dont
kill
the
messenger
if
you
are
going
to
translate
you
have
to
do
it
consistently
if
you
selectively
translate
things
to
serve
your
ugly
purpose

times
messengers
were
usually
killed
by
cutting
their
heads
off
and
sending
