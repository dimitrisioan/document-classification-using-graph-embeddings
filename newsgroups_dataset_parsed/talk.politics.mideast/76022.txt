MY
RESPONSE
TO
THE
SHOOTING
DOWN
OF
A
TURKISH
AIRPLANE
OVER
THE
ARMENIAN
AIR
SPACE
WAS
BECAUSE
OF
THE
IGNORANT
POSTING
OF
THE
PERSON
FROM
YOUR
COUNTRY
TURKS
AND
AZERIS
CONSISTANTLY
WANT
TO
DRAG
ARMENIA
INTO
THE
KARABAKH
CONFLICT
WITH
AZERBAIJAN
THE
KARABAKHIARMENIANS
WHO
HAVE
LIVED
IN
THEIR
HOMELAND
FOR
YEARS
CUT
OFF
FROM
ARMENIA
AND
GIVEN
TO
AZERIS
BY
STALIN
ARE
THE
ONES
DIRECTLY
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CONFLICT
THEY
ARE
DEFENDING
THEMSELVES
AGAINST
AZERI
AGGRESSION
AGRESSION
THAT
HAS
NO
MERCY
FOR
INOCENT
PEOPLE
THAT
ARE
COSTANTLY
SHELLED
WITH
AND
OTHE
RUSSIAN
AIRCRAFT
AT
LAST
I
HOPE
THAT
THE
US
INSISTS
THAT
TURKEY
STAY
OUT
OF
THE
KARABAKH
CRISIS
SO
THAT
THE
REPEAT
OF
THE
CYPRUS
INVASION
WILL
NEVER
OCCUR
AGAIN
ARMENIA
IS
INVOLVED
IN
FIGHTING
WITH
AZARBAIJAN
IT
IS
ARMENIAN
SOLDIERS
FROM
MAINLAND
ARMENIA
THAT
ARE
SHELLING
TOWNS
IN
AZARBAIJAN
YOU
MIGHT
WISH
TO
READ
MORE
ABOUT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
IS
AZERI
AGGRESSION
ONLY
IN
THAT
REGION
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
ARE
BETTER
ORGANIZED
HAVE
MORE
SUCCESS
MILITARILY
AND
SHELL
AZERI
TOWNS
REPEATEDLY
I
DONT
WISH
TO
GET
INTO
THE
CYPRUS
DISCUSSION
TURKEY
HAD
THE
RIGHT
TO
INTERVENE
AND
IT
DID
PERHAPS
THE
INTERVENTION
WAS
NOT
SUPPOSED
TO
LAST
FOR
SO
LONG
BUT
THE
CONSTANT
REFUSAL
OF
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENTS
BOTH
ON
THE
ISLAND
AND
IN
GREECE
TO
DEAL
WITH
REALITY
IS
ALSO
TO
BE
BLAMED
FOR
THE
ONGOING
STANDOFF
IN
THE
REGION
LASTLY
WHY
IS
THERE
NOT
A
SOCCULTUREARMENIA
I
VOTE
YES
FOR
IT
AFTER
ALL
IT
IS
NOW
