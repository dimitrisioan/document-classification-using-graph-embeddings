NOW
EXPLAIN
THIS
THE
NUMBER
OF
TURKS
IN
THRACE
HAS
STEADILY
RISEN
FROM
IN
TO
WHILE
THE
GREEKS
OF
DR
GOEBELS
THOUGHT
THAT
A
LIE
REPEATED
ENOUGH
TIMES
COULD
FINALLY
BE
BELIEVED
I
HAVE
BEEN
OBSERVING
THAT
POLY
HAS
BEEN
PRACTICING
GOEBELS
RULE
QUITE
LOYALLY
POLYS
AUDIENCE
IS
MOSTLY
MADE
OF
GREEKS
WHO
ARE
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
LISTEN
TO
TURKISH
NEWS
HOWEVER
IN
TODAYS
INFORMED
WORLD
GREEK
PROPAGANDISTS
CAN
ONLY
FOOL
THEMSELVES
FOR
INSTANCE
THOSE
WHO
LIVED
IN
WILL
REMEMBER
THE
TV
NEWS
THEY
WATCHED
AND
THE
NEWSPAPERS
THEY
READ
AND
THE
YOUNGER
GENERATION
CAN
READ
THE
AMERICAN
NEWSPAPERS
OF
JULY
AND
AUGUST
TO
FIND
OUT
WHAT
REALLY
HAPPENED
THERE
ARE
IN
TURKIYE
THE
GREEK
HOSPITAL
THE
GREEK

AS

THE
LONGSTANDING
USE
OF
THE
ADJECTIVE
TURKISH
IN
TITLES
AND
ON
SIGNBOARDS
IS
PROHIBITED
THE
GREEK
COURTS
HAVE
ORDERED
THE
CLOSURE
OF
THE
TURKISH
TEACHERS
ASSOCIATION
THE
KOMOTINI
TURKISH
YOUTH
ASSOCIATION
AND
THE
KSANTI
TURKISH
ASSOCIATION
ON
GROUNDS
THAT
THERE
ARE
NO
TURKS
IN
WESTERN
THRACE
SUCH
COMMUNITY
ASSOCIATIONS
HAD
BEEN
ACTIVE
UNTIL
BUT
THEY
WERE
FIRST
TOLD
TO
REMOVE
THE
WORD
TURKISH
ON
THEIR
BUILDINGS
AND
ON
THEIR
OFFICIAL
PAPERS
AND
THEN
EVENTUALLY
CLOSE
DOWN
THIS
IS
ALSO
THE
FINAL
VERDICT
NOVEMBER
OF
THE
GREEK
HIGH
COURT
IN
THE
CITY
OF
KOMOTINI
A
FORMER
GREEK
PARLIAMENTARIAN
OF
TURKISH
PARENTAGE
WAS
SENTENCED
RECENTLY
TO
MONTHS
OF
IMPRISONMENT
WITH
NO
RIGHT
TO
APPEAL
JUST
FOR
SAYING
OUTLOUD
THAT
HE
WAS
OF
TURKISH
DESCENT
THIS
DULYELECTED
ETHNIC
TURKISH
OFFICIAL
WAS
ALSO
DEPRIVED
OF
HIS
POLITICAL
RIGHTS
FOR
A
PERIOD
OF
THREE
YEARS
EACH
ONE
OF
THESE
BARBARIC
ACTS
SEEMS
TO
BE
NONE
OTHER
THAN
A
VEHICLE
USED
BY
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENTS
TO
COVERUP
THEIR
INFERIORITY
COMPLEX
THEY
DISPLAY
VISAVIS
THE
PEOPLE
OF
TURKIYE
THE
AGREEMENT
ON
THE
EXCHANGE
OF
MINORITIES
USES
THE
TERM
TURKS
WHICH
DEMONSTRATES
WHAT
IS
ACTUALLY
MEANT
BY
THE
PREVIOUS
REFERENCE
TO
MUSLIMS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENTS
ALSO
MENTION
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
FEW
THOUSAND
NONTURKISH
MUSLIMS
DOES
NOT
CHANGE
THE
ESSENTIAL
REALITY
THAT
THERE
LIVES
IN
WESTERN
THRACE
A
MUCH
BIGGER
TURKISH
MINORITY
THE
POMAKS
ARE
ALSO
A
MUSLIM
PEOPLE
WHOM
ALL
THE
THREE
NATIONS
BULGARIANS
TURKS
AND
GREEKS
CONSIDER
AS
PART
OF
THEMSELVES
DO
YOU
KNOW
HOW
THE
MUSLIM
TURKISH
MINORITY
WAS
ORGANIZED
ACCORDING
TO
THE
AGREEMENTS
POOR
POLY
IT
ALSO
PROVES
THAT
THE
TURKISH
PEOPLE
ARE
TRAPPED
IN
GREECE
AND
THE
GREEK
PEOPLE
ARE
FREE
TO
SETTLE
ANYWHERE
IN
THE
WORLD
THE
GREEK
AUTHORITIES
DENY
EVEN
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
A
TURKISH
MINORITY
THEY
PURSUE
THE
SAME
DENIAL
IN
CONNECTION
WITH
THE
MACEDONIANS
OF
GREECE
TALK
ABOUT
OPPRESSION
IN

IN

PARLIAMENT
PASSED

NO
VIRTUALLY
TAKING
OVER
THE

THEY
HAVE
CEASED
TO
BE
SELFSUPPORTING
RELIGIOUS
AND

ENTITIES
TALK
ABOUT
FASCISM
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENTS
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
APPOINT
THE
MUFTUS
IRRESPECTIVE
OF
THE
WILL
OF
THE
TURKISH
MINORITY
AS
STATE
OFFICIAL
ALTHOUGH
THE
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
HAS
FULL
AUTHORITY
IN
SIMILAR
MATTERS
IN
GREECE
THE
MUSLIM
TURKISH
MINORITY
WILL
HAVE
NO
SAY
IN
ELECTING
ITS
RELIGIOUS
LEADERS
TALK
ABOUT
DEMOCRACY
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
GREECE
HAS
RECENTLY
DESTROYED
AN
ISLAMIC
CONVENTION
IN
KOMOTINI
SUCH
DESTRUCTION
WHICH
REFLECTS
AN
ATTITUDE
AGAINST
THE
MUSLIM
TURKISH
CULTURAL
HERITAGE
IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
THE
LAUSANNE
CONVENTION
AS
WELL
AS
THE
SOCALLED
GREEK
CONSTITUTION
WHICH
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
GUARANTEE
THE
PROTECTION
OF
HISTORICAL
MONUMENTS
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
GREECE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IS
BUILDING
NEW
CHURCHES
IN
REMOTE
VILLAGES
AS
A
COMPLEMENTARY
STEP
TOWARD
HELLENIZING
THE

AND
YOU
PONDERED
SIDIROPOULOS
THE

BECAME
THE

VICTIM
OF
A

HIS

THE

ASKED
HIM
TO

IN

THE
GREEK

ARE
TRYING
TO
PUNISH
HIM
FOR
HIS
INVOLVEMENT
IN
COPENHAGEN
HE
RETURNED
TO
FLORINA
BY
HIS
OWN
CHOICE
AND
REMAINS
WITHOUT
A

HELSINKI
WATCH
A
WELLKNOWN
HUMAN

GROUP
HAD
BEEN
INVESTIGATING
THE
PLIGHT
OF
THE

MINORITY
IN

IN
AUGUST
THEIR
FINDINGS
WERE
PUBLISHED
IN
A

TITLED
DESTROYING

TURKS
OF

THE
REPORT
CONFIRMED
GROSS
VIOLATIONS
OF
THE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
OF
THE
TURKISH
MINORITY
BY
THE
GREEK
AUTHORITIES
IT
SAYS
FOR
INSTANCE
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENT
RECENTLY
DESTROYED
AN
ISLAMIC
CONVENT
IN
KOMOTINI
SUCH
DESTRUCTION
WHICH
REFLECTS
AN
ATTITUDE
AGAINST
THE

TURKISH

IS
A
VIOLATION
OF
THE
LAUSANNE

THE
TURKISH
CEMETERIES
IN
THE

VAFEIKA
AND
IN
PINARLIK
WERE
ATTACKED
AND
TOMBSTONES
WERE
BROKEN
THE

WAS
RAZED
BY

SHALL
I
GO
ON
WHY
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
OF
TURKIYE
ARE
NOT
GOING
TO
TAKE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
LESSONS
FROM
THE
GREEK
GOVERNMENT
THE
DISCUSSION
OF
HUMAN

VIOLATIONS
IN
GREECE
DOES
NOT
STOP
AT
THE
GREEK
FRONTIER
IN
SEVERAL
FOLLOWING
ARTICLES
I
SHALL
DWELL
ON
AND
EXPOSE
THE
GREEK
TREATMENT
OF
TURKS
IN
WESTERN
THRACE
AND
THE
AEGEAN
MACEDONIANS
IT
HAS
BEEN
REPORTED
THAT
THE
GREEK
CYPRIOT
ADMINISTRATION
HAS
AN
INTENSE
DESIRE
FOR
ARMS
AND
THAT
GREECE
HAS
MADE
PLANS
TO
SUPPLY
IT
WITH
THE
TANKS
AND
ARMORED
VEHICLES
IT
HAS
TO
DESTROY
IN
ACCORDANCE
WITH
THE
AGREEMENT
REACHED
ON
CONVENTIONAL

GREEK

PLANNED

OSTENTATIOUS
MEASURES
AIMED
AT
CAMOUFLAGING
THE
TRANSFER
OF
THESE
TANKS
AND
ARMORED
VEHICLES
TO
SOUTHERN
CYPRUS
A
PROCESS
THAT
WILL
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
SPIRIT
OF
THE
AGREEMENT
ON
CONVENTIONAL
ARMS
REDUCTION
IN
EUROPE
AN
ACCEPTABLE
METHOD
MAY
CERTAINLY
BE
FOUND
WHEN
THERE
IS
A
WILL

WE
KNOW

VARIOUS
KINDS
OF
VIOLENT
BEHAVIORS
RANGING
