HASAN
REPLIES
I
DIDNOT
KNOW
THAT
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
CAN
BE
NAME
CLLING
TOO
UNLESS
YOU
CONSIDER
YOURSELF
DESERVELESS
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
REFERRING
TO
SOMEONE
ELSE
YOU
HAVE
IN
FACT
GIVEN
ME
A
NAME
I
DID
NOT
ASK
FOR
HENCE
THE
TERM
NAME
CALLING
HASAN
WRITES
SO
WHAT
DO
YOU
EXPECT
ME
TO
TELL
YOU
TO
TELL
YOU
MASTER
OF
WSIDOM
I
REPLIED
IF
YOU
INSIST
ON
GIVING
ME
NAMESTITLES
I
DID
NOT
ASK
FOR
YOU
COULD
AT
LEAST
SPELL
THEM
CORRECTLY
SIGH
HASAN
GLOATS
THAT
WAS
ONLY
TO
CONFUSE
YOU
HA
HA
HA
HEY
HELLBENT
ON
RETARDING
INTO
CHILDHOOD
NO
WHEN
YOU
ARE
INTENTIONALLY
NEGLECTING
THE
MOST
IMPORTANT
FACT
THAT
THE
WHOLE
ISRAELI
PRESENCE
IN
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
IS
ILLEGITIMATE
AND
HENCE
ALL
THEIR
ACTIONS
THEIR
COURTS
THEIR
LAWS
ARE
ILLEGITIMATE
ON
THE
GROUND
OF
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
NO
I
AM
NOT
NEGLECTING
THAT
IM
MERELY
ASKING
YOU
WHETHER
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
ISRAELI
CITICENS
IN
THE
WB
OR
IN
GAZA
INVALIDATES
THOSE
INDIVIDUALS
RIGHT
ARE
YOU
TRYING
TO
RETALIATE
AND
CONFUSE
ME
HERE
NO
I
REALLY
DO
TRY
TO
SPELL
CORRECTLY
AND
I
APOLOGIZE
IF
I
DID
CONFUSE
YOU
I
WILL
TRY
NOT
TO
REPEAT
THAT
TO
LIVE
A
AS
YOU
SO
ELOQUENTLY
PUT
IT
HUMAN
RIGHT
WE
CAN
GET
BACK
TO
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHICH
LAW
SHOULD
BE
USED
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
LATER
ALSO
YOU
HAVE
NOT
ADRESSED
MY
QUESTION
IF
THE
ISRAELIS
ALSO
HAVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
FIRST
MY
ABOVE
STATEMENT
DOESNOT
SAY
THAT
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
IN
THE
WB
REVOKE
THEIR
RIGHT
OF
LIFE
BUT
IT
SAYS
THE
ISRAELI
OCCUPATION
OF
THE
WB
REVOKE
THE
RIGHT
OF
LIFE
FOR
SOMEMOST
ITS
CITIZENS
BASICALLY
REVOKES
THE
RIGHT
OF
FOR
ITS
MILITARY
MEN
CLEARLY
OCCUPATION
IS
AN
UNDECLARED
WAR
DURING
WAR
ATTACKS
AGAINST
MILITARY
TARGETS
ARE
FULLY
LEGITIMATE
OK
LET
ME
REPHRASE
THE
QUESTION
I
HAVE
REPEATEDLY
ASKED
YOU
IF
THE
ISRAELIS
HAVE
LESS
HUMAN
RIGHTS
THAN
THE
PALESTINIANS
AND
IF
SO
WHY
FROM
YOUR
POSTING
WHERE
YOU
DID
NOT
DIRECTLY
ADRESS
MY
QUESTION
I
INFERRED
THAT
YOU
THOUGHT
SO
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
ABOVE
STATEMENT
I
THEN
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
REASON
WAS
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
RE
YOUR
STATEMENT
OF
OCCUPATION
ID
LIKE
YOU
TO
DEFINE
THE
TERM
SO
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
REPEAT
THIS
DRAG
THE
ANSWER
OUT
OF
HASAN
PROCEDURE
MORE
THAN
NECCESARY
SECONDLY
SURELY
ISRAELI
HAVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
BUT
THEY
ASK
THEIR
GOVERMENT
TO
PROTECT
IT
BY
WITHDRAWING
FROM
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRETORIES
NOT
BY
FURTHER
OPPRESSING
PALESTINEAN
HUMAN
RIGHTS
IM
SORRY
BUT
THE
ABOVE
SENTENCE
DOES
NOT
MAKE
SENSE
PLEASE
REPHRASE
IT
IF
A
STATE
CAN
DEPRIVE
ALL
ITS
CITIZENS
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
BY
ITS
ACTIONS
THEN
TELL
ME
WHY
ANY
HUMAN
LIVING
TODAY
SHOULD
HAVE
ANY
RIGHTS
AT
ALL
BECAUSE
NOT
ALL
STATES
ARE
LIKE
ISRAEL
AS
OPPRESSIVE
AS
IGNORANT
OR
AS
TYRANT
OH
OK
SO
HOW
ABOUT
THE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
OF
THE
SYRIANS
IRAQIS
AND
OTHERS
DOES
THE
NAME
OF
HAMA
SOUND
FAMILIAR
OR
HOW
ABOUT
THE
KURDS
IN
IRAQ
AND
TURKEY
HOW
ABOUT
THE
SAME
IN
SWEDEN
OK
MAYBE
A
BIT
FARFETCHED
THE
RUSSIANS
IN
THE
BALTIC
STATES
OR
THE
MOSLEM
IN
THE
OLD
USSR
AND
YUGOSLAVIA
DO
THE
SERBS
HAVE
ANY
HUMAN
RIGHTS
REMAINAING
ACCORDING
TO
YOU
AND
WHICH
SYSTEM
DO
YOU
PROPOSE
WE
USE
TO
SOLVE
THE
ME
PROBLEM
THE
QUESTION
IS
NOT
WHICH
SYSTEM
WOULD
SOLVE
THE
ME
PROBLEM
WHY
BECAUSE
ANY
SYSTEM
CAN
SOLVE
IT
THE
LAWS
OF
MINISTER
SHARON
SAYS
KICK
PALESTINEANS
OUT
OF
HERE
ALL
PALESTINE
I
ASKED
FOR
WHICH
SYSTEM
SHOULD
BE
USED
THAT
WILL
PRESERVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
FOR
ALL
PEOPLE
INVOLVED
I
ASSUMED
THAT
WAS
OBVIOUS
BUT
I
WONT
REPEAT
THAT
MISTAKE
NOW
THAT
I
HAVE
STRAIGHTENED
THAT
OUT
IM
EAGERLY
AWAITING
YOUR
REPLY
SO
YOU
AGREE
THAT
THAT
AN
ISRAELI
SOLUTION
WOULDNOT
PRESERVE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
I
AM
UNDERSTANDING
THIS
FROM
YOUR
FIRST
STATEMENT
IN
THIS
PARAGRAPH
NO
IM
AGREEING
THAT
TO
JUST
KICK
ALL
THE
PALESTINIANS
OUT
OF
ISRAEL
PROPER
WOULD
PROBABLY
LEAD
TO
DISASTER
FOR
BOTH
PARTIES
IF
THATS
WHAT
YOU
REFER
TO
AS
THE
ISRAELI
SOLUTION
THEN
SO
BE
IT
JOSEPH
WEITZ
ADMINISTRATOR
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
JEWISH
COLONIZATION
SAID
IT
BEST
WHEN
WRITING
IN
HIS
DIARY
IN
BETWEEN
OURSELVES
IT
MUST
BE
CLEAR
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
ROOM
FOR
BOTH
PEOPLES
TOGETHER
IN
THIS
COUNTRY
WE
SHALL
NOT
ACHIEVE
OUR
GOAL
OF
BEING
AN
INDEPENDENT
PEOPLE
WITH
THE
ARABS
IN
THIS
SMALL
COUNTRY
THE
ONLY
SOLUTION
IS
A
PALESTINE
AT
LEAST
WESTERN
PALESTINE
WEST
OF
THE
JORDAN
RIVER
WITHOUT
ARABS
AND
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
THAN
TO
TRANSFER
THE
ARABS
FROM
HERE
TO
THE
NEIGHBOURING
COUNTRIES
TO
TRANSFER
ALL
OF
THEM
NOT
ONE
VILLAGE
NOT
ONE
TRIBE
SHOULD
BE
LEFT
ONLY
AFTER
THIS
TRANSFER
WILL
THE
COUNTRY
BE
ABLE
TO
ABSORB
THE
MILLIONS
OF
OUR
OWN
BRETHREN
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
OUT
DAVAR
SEPTEMBER
COURTESY
OF
MARC
AFIFI
JUST
A
QUESTION
IF
WE
ARE
TO
DISREGARD
THE
RATHER
OBVIOUS
REFERENCES
TO
GETTING
ISRAEL
OUT
OF
ME
ONE
WAY
OR
THE
OTHER
IN
BOTH
PLO
COVENANT
AND
HAMAS
CHARTER
THATS
THE
ENGLISH
TRANSLATIONS
IF
YOU
HAVE
OTHER
INFORMATION
ID
BE
INTERESTED
TO
HAVE
YOU
TRANSLATE
IT
WHY
SHOULD
WE
GIVE
ANY
CREDENCE
TO
A
PRIVATE
PAPER
EVEN
OLDER
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
GET
INTO
THE
QUESTION
IF
HE
WROTE
THE
ABOVE
BUT
ITS
FAIRLY
OBVIOUS
ALL
PARTIES
IN
THE
CONFLICT
HAVE
THEIR
SHARE
OF
FANATICS
GUESS
WHAT
THOSE
ARE
NOT
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WILL
MAKE
ANY
LASTING
PEACE
IN
THE
REGION
MORE
DELETED
STUFF
EXACTLY
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
I
GUESS
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERMENTIS
FULL
WITH
MEN
LIKE
JOSEPH
WEITZ
OH
HAVE
YOU
MET
WITH
THEM
PERSONALLY
TO
READ
THEIR
DIARIES
FASCINATING
WHAT
DO
YOU
DO
FOR
A
LIVING
WE
AND
OUR
EITHER
REFERS
TO
ZIONISTS
OR
JEWS
I
DONOT
KNOW
WHICH
WELL
I
CAN
GIVE
YOU
AN
ANSWER
YOU
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
I
WILL
NOT
SUGGEST
THE
IMPERIALIST
ISRAELI
SYSTEM
FOR
SOLVING
THE
ME
PROBLEM
I
THINK
THAT
IS
FAIR
ENOUGH
NO
THAT
IS
NOT
AN
ANSWER
SINCE
I
ASKED
FOR
A
SYSTEM
THAT
COULD
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
YOU
SAID
ANY
COULD
BE
USED
THEN
YOU
PROVIDED
A
CONTRADICTION
ABOVE
YOU
WROTE
THAT
YOU
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
I
MEANT
UNDERLINED
BY
ANY
SYSTEM
CAN
BE
USED
TO
SOLVE
THE
CONFLICT
BUT
NOT
ANY
SYSTEM
WOULD
RESOLVE
IT
JUSTLY
AN
UNJUST
SOLUTION
WOULD
BE
A
NONSOLUTION
PER
DEFINITION
NO
YOU
SAID
THE
FOLLOWING
FOR
ALL
A
IT
HOLDS
THAT
A
HAVE
PROPERTY
B
THERE
EXISTS
AN
A
SUCH
THAT
PROPERTY
B
DOES
NOT
HOLD
THUS
EITHER
OR
BOTH
STATEMENTS
MUST
BE
FALSE
GUESS
WHERE
THAT
TAKES
YOUR
LOGIC
TO
NEVERNEVER
LAND
YOU
ARE
PROVING
YOURSELF
AS
A
FIRST
YOU
UNDERSTOOD
WHAT
I
MEANT
BUT
THEN
YOU
CLAIM
YOU
DIDNOT
SO
TO
CLAIM
A
CONTRADICTION
IN
MY
LOGIC
TOO
BAD
FOR
YOU
THE
MASTER
OF
WISDOM
I
WAS
MERELY
POINTING
OUT
A
NOT
SO
SMALL
FLAW
IN
YOUR
REASONING
SINCE
YOU
CLAIM
TO
BE
LOGICAL
I
FELT
IT
BEST
TO
POINT
THIS
OUT
BEFORE
YOU
STARTED
USING
YOUR
STATEMENTS
TO
PROVE
A
POINT
OR
SO
AM
I
THEN
TO
ASSUME
YOU
ARE
NOT
LOGICAL
THE
GREATEST
PROBLEM
OF
ZIONISM
IS
ARAB
CHILDREN
RABBI
SHOHAM
OH
AND
BY
THE
WAY
LET
ME
ADD
THAT
THESE
CUTE
QUOTES
YOU
PUT
AT
THE
END
ARE
A
REAL
BUMMER
WHEN
I
TRY
GIVING
YOUR
POSTS
ANY
CREDIT
WHY
DO
YOU
FEEL
ASHAMED
BY
THINGS
AND
FACTS
THAT
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
IF
YOU
WERE
A
ZIONISTS
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
IN
ZIONIST
CODES
AND
ACTS
WELL
I
FEEL
SORRY
FOR
YOU
BECAUSE
THE
SAME
RABBI
SHOHAM
HAD
SAID
YES
ZIONISM
IS
RACISM
IF
YOU
FEEL
ASHAMED
AND
BOTHERED
BY
THE
ZIONIST
CODES
THEN
DROP
ZIONISM
IF
YOU
ARE
NOT
ZIONIST
WHY
ARE
YOU
BOTHERED
THEN
YOU
SHOULD
JOIN
ME
IN
CONDEMNING
THESE
RACIST
ZIONIST
CODES
AND
ACTS
ANY
QUOTE
CAN
BE
MISUSED
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
USED
TO
STEREOTYPE
ALL
INDIVIDUALS
BY
A
STATEMENT
OF
AN
INDIVIDUAL
IF
YOU
USE
THE
SAME
METHODS
THAT
YOU
CREDIT
ZIONISTS
WITH
THEN
WHERE
DOES
THAT
PLACE
YOU
OH
BY
THE
WAY
ID
ADVICE
YOU
NOT
TO
ASSUME
ANYTHING
ABOUT
MY
LOYALTIES
I
WILL
AND
AM
CONDEMNING
ACTS
I
FIND
VILE
AND
INHUMAN
BUT
ILL
TRY
AS
LONG
AS
I
CAN
NOT
TO
ASSUME
THOSE
ACTS
ARE
BY
A
WHOLE
PEOPLE
BY
ZIONIST
ABOVE
DO
YOU
MEAN
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
ISRAEL
THE
LEADERS
OF
ISRAEL
POLITICAL
ANDOR
RELIGIOUS
OR
THE
JEWS
IN
GENERAL
IF
YOU
FEEL
THE
NEED
TO
CONDEMN
CONDEMN
THOSE
RESPONSIBLE
INSTEAD
HOW
WOULD
YOU
FEEL
IF
WE
STARTED
CONDEMNING
YOU
PERSONALLY
BASED
ON
THE
BOMBINGS
IN
EGYPT
