THE

TRIED

TO

ISRAEL
FOR

VIOLATION

THE

FAILED
TO

THUS

WOW
IF
YOU
WERE
THE
ONLY
SOURCE
OF
NEWS
AROUND
THE
WORLD
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
ISRAEL
IS
BEING
TREATED
UNFAIRLY
LUCKILY
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
CASE
I
SUGGEST
READING
EUROPEAN
PAPERS
RATHER
THAN
ISRAELI
PROPAGANDA
ARAB
PAPERS
WOULDNT
HURT
EITHER
TO
SEE
THE
PROPAGANDA
OF
THE
OTHER
SIDE
ANYWAY
YOU
ARE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
WHAT
HAPPENS
WHEN
PEOPLE
CHOSE
WHAT
TO
READ
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
IT
IS
PERFECTLY
WITHIN
YOUR
RIGHTS
JUST
DONT
GO
OFF
ACTING
LIKE
YOURE
OBJECTIVE
IM
UNCLEAR
HERE
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
THESE
EVENTS
DID
NOT
OCCURR
AS
YOU
KNOW
THE
UN
NEITHER
CONDEMNED
NOR
EXPRESSED
OUTRAGE
AT
ANY
OF
THE
EVENTS
LISTED
I
RETAINED
THOSE
THAT
REFLECTED
POLICIES
OF
MURDER
AND
ABUSE
IS
THAT
AN
IRRELEVENT
FACT
TO
YOU
WHILE
I
DO
EXPECT
ISRAELS
ABUSIVE
POLICIES
TO
BE
CONDEMNED
WHERE
APPROPRIATE
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
YOU
DO
NOT
NOTICE
ANY
DEGREE
OF
SELECTIVE
MORALITY
ON

UNS
PART
DO
YOU
ALSO
FIND
IT
CONVENIENT
AND
EASY
TO
BLITHELY

ABHORRANT

I
HAVE
TO
SAY
I
THINK
THIS
IS
THE
FIRST
TIME
THERE
HAS
BEEN
SOMETHING
POSTED
THAT
OPPOSED
ME
WITHOUT
MAKING
PERSONAL
INSULTS
CONGRADULATIONS
TIM
I
THINK
THE
OTHER
PEOPLE
ANSWERED
YOU
ON
MOST
OF
THE
FACTUAL
PARTSESP
ABOUT
THE
INTERNAL
CONFLICTS
POLICY
ISRAEL
VERY
OFTEN
GETS
AWAY
WITH
MORE
THAN
MOST
OTHER
NATIONS
DUE
TO
US
VETOS
WHILE
I
AM
NOT
FAMILIAR
WITH
EVERY
INSTANCE
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
REASON
SAUDI
ARABIA
WAS
NOT
CONDEMNED
FOR
KILLIG
THE
PILGRIMS
WAS
THAT
THE
PILGRIMS
WERE
IRANIAN
YES
THE
UN
IS
BIASED
BUT
MOSTLY
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
US
AND
ITS
ALLIES
INCLUDING
ISRAEL
SAUDI
ARABIA
AND
PAKISTAN
AND
AGAINST
OUTLAW
COUNTRIES
LIKE
IRAN
AND
MORE
RECENTLY
IRAQ
FAR
BE
IT
FROM
ME
TO
SUPPORT
THE
REPRESSIVE
GOVERNMENTS
THERE
BUT
I
THINK
THEY
GET
MORE
SLACK
THAN
ISRAEL
FOR
THINGS
THEY
DO
WRONG
AGAIN
THE
REASON
SOME
CONDEMNATIONS
DONT
OCCUR
LIES
IN
THE
RACE
OR
COUNTRY
OF
THE
VICTIMS
THE
GASSED
IRAQI
KURDS
GOT
ASSOCIATED
WITH
IRAN
IN
THE
WAR
AND
SINCE
IRAN
WAS
PERCEIVED
AS
WORSE
THAN
IRAQ
NO
CONDEMNATION
RESULTED
THE
PALESTINIANS
KILLED
BY
ARAB
COUNTRIES
INVOLVED
ANOTHER
CASE
OF
WHO
CARES
IT
SEEMS
THAT
UNTIL
VERY
RECENTLY
NO
ONE
CARED
ABOUT
HOW
MANY
PALESTINIANS
DIED
ANYWHERE
INCLUDING
IN
ISRAEL
AND
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
AGAIN
I
APPRECIATE
THE
LACK
OF
PERSONAL
INSULTS
