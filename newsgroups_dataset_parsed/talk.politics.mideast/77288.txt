BOSNIANS
MOHAMMED

WRITES
MUSLIMS
HELPING
THE
NAZIS
WHERE
ON
EARTH
DO
YOU
COME
UP
WITH
SUCH
ACCUUSATION
DO
YOU
HAVE
PROOFS
IF
NOT
YOU
SHOULD
PUBLICALLY
APOLOGIZE
FOR
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
LAST
TIME
I
HEARD
THE
NAZIS
PRIDED
THEMSELVES
IN
NEEDING
NO
BODY
TO
CARRY
THEIR
POLITICS
AND
IDEOLOGIES
AND
IF
YOUR
STATMENT
WERE
TRUE
DONT
YOU
THINK
ISRAEL
WOULD
OF
USED
IT
TO
POINT
TO
WHAT
A
MUSLIM
NEIGHBOR
PALESTINE
COULD
DO
TO
THEM
IF
THEY
ALLOWED
IT
TO
BE
THE
JEWISH
LOBBY
AND
POWER
IS
VERY
STRONG
AND
IF
WHAT
YOU
SAID
IS
TRUE
WE
WOULD
OF
HEARD
IT
FROM
THEM
BEFORE
YOU
COULD
COME
UP
WITH
IT
AND
YOU
DARE
SAY
THAT
YOU
ARE
TAKING
NO
SIDES
MY
REFERENCE
IS
A
PAGE
ESSAY
IN
OUR
LOCAL
STAR
TRIBUTE
NEWSPAPER
PUTTING
THE
WHOLE
CONFLICT
IN
PERSPECTIVE
I
WILL
READILY
ADMIT
THAT
I
AM
NO
AUTHORITY
IN
THIS
AREA
HOWEVER
OTHER
POSTEERS
ASSERTED
THAT
SOME
MUSLIMS
DID
JOIN
HANDS
WITH
CROATS
AND
NAZIS
IN
PERSECUTING
SERBS
IN
ANY
CASE
PAST
ACTIONS
DO
NOT
IN
ANY
WAY
VALIDATE
OR
LEGITIMIZE
WHAT
IS
HAPPENDING
THERE
NOW
I
SINCERELY
DO
APOLOGIZE
TO
THE
EXTENT
THE
AUTHOR
OF
THE
ESSAY
WAS
WRONG
IN
MAKING
THE
ASSERTION
HE
MADE
MAYBE
SOME
STUDENT
OF
HISTORY
MAY
PUT
THIS
IN
PERSPECTIVE
