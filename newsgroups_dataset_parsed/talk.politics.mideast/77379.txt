AND
IF
YOU
ARE
JEWISH
YOU
ARE
A
SELFHATING
JEW
THERE
CAN
BE
NO
DOUBT
OF
THIS
THERE
ARE
DOUBTS
ABOUT
IT
WHY
DONT
YOU
DEFINE
WHAT
SELFHATING
JEW
MEANS
I
FOUND
THE
IDEA
ITSELF
OF
BEING
A
SELFHATING
JEW
TO
BE
ONE
OF
THOSE
I
HOPE
YOU
CAN
COME
UP
WITH
A
DEFINITION
IN
ITSELF
TRY
COMING
UP
WITH
YOUR
OWN
DEFINITION
OF
ANY
OR
ALL
SELFHATING
PEOPLES
TO
ME
ANY
WHO
REJECT
THEIR
CULTURE
TO
THE
POINT
WHERE
THEY
ONLY
SEE
THE
ABSOLUTE
NEGATIVES
OF
THAT
CULTURE
GENERALLY
OR
REGARDING
A
PARTICULAR
EVENT
AND
ACCEPT
ONLY
THOSE
VIEWS
PURELY
OPPOSING
ASPECTS
OF
THAT
CULTURE
THUS
SELECTIVE
BELIEF
IN
AND
USE
OF
HISTORICAL
FACTS
AND
A
COMPLETE
IGNORING
OF
CONTEXT
RESULTS
HATE
THEIR
CULTURE
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THINGS
ARE
GETTING
MIXED
HERE
CRITIZICING
ISRAEL
ANDOR
BEING
ANTIZIONIST
IS
NOT
SEEING
THE
ABSOLUTE
NEGATIVES
OF
THAT
CULTURE
MAYBE
BECAUSE
A
PERSON
CAN
SEE
THE
POSITIVES
OF
THAT
CULTURE
IS
THAT
THAT
PERSON
OPPOSES
ZIONISM
AND
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
I
FOR
ONE
CONSIDER
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
STATE
OF
ISRAEL
WITH
RESPECT
TO
THE
HUMAN
RIGHTS
OF
THE
PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
AN
ACTION
THATY
OPPOSES
WHAT
JEWISH
CULTURE
WAS
SUPPOSE
TO
UPHOLD
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
RESPECT
AND
WHAT
THE
JEWISH
PEOPLE
LEARNED
ABOUT
OPPRESION
SEGREGATION
AND
YEARS
IN
THE
DIASPORA
THAT
CERTAINLY
DESCRIBES
ELIAS
SINCE
HE
HAS
NO
INTENTION
OF
RECOGNIZING
THAT
ALONGSIDE
THE
PALESTINIAN
EXPERIENCE
AND
PERSPECTIVE
THERE
EXISTS
ALSO
THAT
OF
ISRAELIS
HE
MIGHT
NOT
WANT
TO
RECOGNIZE
THAT
IT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
HIM
A
SELFHATING
JEW
AS
FAR
AS
I
SEE
IT
AT
MOST
HE
IS
A
PERSON
WHO
IS
NOT
TELLING
THE
TRUTH
WHO
IS
A
JEW
A
PERSON
WHOSE
INTEGRITY
DECAYS
WHEN
UNMOVED
BY
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
WRONG
DONE
TO
OTHER
PEOPLE
A
J
HESCHEL
THAT
IS
WHY
I
GET
MOVED
WHEN
I
SEE
THE
ISRAELI
ARMY
KILLING
PEOPLE
IN
THE
OCCUPIED
TERRITORIES
AS
MUCH
AS
I
GET
MOVED
WHEN
I
SEE
A
PLESTINIAN
STABING
PEOPLE
IN
ISRAEL
AAP
AND
THIS
IS
PRECISELY
WHY
ISRAELI
SOCIETY
HAS
BEEN
TREMENDOUSLY
HARMED
BY
THE
ACTIONS
IT
ITS
GOVERNMENT
HAS
FELT
IT
HAD
TO
TAKE
IN
RESPONSE
TO
AN
OTHER
PERCEIVED
AS
A
THREAT
JUST
AS
WITH
YOU
THERE
HAS
LONG
BEEN
A
STRIDENT
AND
EMOTIONAL
DEBATE
ABOUT
THE
PAIN
ISRAELIS
FEEL
WHEN
FORCED
TO
BALANCE
DESIRES
FOR
SURVIVAL
AND
MORAL
BELIEFS
THE
TRAUMA
OF
HAVING
TO
MAKE
THAT
CHOICE
IS
MADE
WORSE
BY
THE
FACT
THAT
NEITHER
CAN
BE
CONVENIENTLY
BRUSHED
ASIDE
AS
A
RESULT
OF
A
REASONED
POLITICAL
DEBATE
FOR
THE
SAKE
OF
THE
OTHER
ONLY
RESHAPED
BUT
SO
FAR
IT
SEEMS
THAT
THE
BLAME
IS
ALWAYS
PUT
ON
THE
OTHER
IF
YOU
READ
THIS
NEWSGROUP
FOR
EXAMPLE
ISRAEL
IS
NEVER
GUILTY
BY
HERSELF
SHE
IS
ALWAYS
RESPONDING
TO
THE
ACTIONS
OF
THE
OTHER
AND
IT
GOES
AS
IF
THE
ACTIONS
OF
ISREAL
DO
NOT
ALSO
AFFECT
THE
RESPONSE
OF
THE
OTHER
IN
A
CYCLE
THAT
NEVER
ENDS
ALSO
THERE
IS
BLINDNESS
TO
TRY
TO
UNDERSTAND
WHAT
THE
OTHER
FEELS
AND
WHY
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
AND
EXCUSE
THERE
IS
ALWAYS
A
RATIONALE
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
THINGS
HAPPEN
AS
THEY
DO
AND
WHAT
IS
THE
WORST
PART
FOR
ME
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
ALL
THE
TIME
AN
INTENTION
TO
TRY
TO
DEHUMANIZE
THE
OTHER
AS
IF
THE
OTHER
DID
NOT
CARE

THEIR
