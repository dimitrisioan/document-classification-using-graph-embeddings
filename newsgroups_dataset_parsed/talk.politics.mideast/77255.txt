i
like
what
mr
joseph
biden
had
to
say
yesterday
in
the
senate
condemening
the
european
lack
of
action
and
lack
of
support
to
us
plans
and
calling
that
moral
rape
it
is
easy
for
sen
biden
to
say
that
when
there
are
no
us
troops
in
zepa
or
srebinica
or
sarejevo
the
existing
un
policy
may
certaining
be
wrong
but
the
us
wants
to
dictate
policy
and
make
europe
responsible
for
the
consequences
of
that
policy
bosnia
is
a
big
enough
problem
for
the
us
to
preach
about
what
other
countries
should
be
doing
with
their
forcesbut
its
forces
are
safely
tucked
away
at
home
in
the
us
gerald
