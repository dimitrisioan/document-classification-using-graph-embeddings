i
like
what
mr
joseph
biden
had
to
say
yesterday
in
the
senate
condemening
the
european
lack
of
action
and
lack
of
support
to
us
plans
and
calling
that
moral
rape
he
went
on
to
say
that
the
reason
for
that
is
out
right
religious
bigotry
actually
this
strife
in
yugoslavia
goes
back
a
long
way
bosinan
muslims
in
collaboration
with
the
nazis
did
to
serbians
after
the
first
world
war
what
serbs
are
doing
to
muslims
now
this
is
not
a
fresh
case
of
ethnic
cleansing
but
just
another
chapter
in
the
continuing
saga
of
intense
mutual
hatred
destruction
not
taking
sides
in
this
perpetual
war
does
not
amount
to
religious
bigotry
it
could
just
be
helplessness
with
regards
to
bringing
peace
to
a
region
that
does
not
even
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
what
a
lie
ask
the
victims
of
the
nazis
dont
take
the
bosnian
muslims
word
for
it
ask
the
holoucost
survivors
who
helped
them
you
will
hear
that
the
bosnian
muslims
among
others
helped
them
i
also
do
object
to
the
term
ethnic
cleansing
since
what
is
happening
in
bosnia
is
not
ethnic
cleansing
they
all
have
the
same
ethnicity
what
is
different
is
religion
they
are
orthodox
christians
catholic
christians
and
muslims
its
religious
cleansing
also
watching
people
being
rounded
up
and
slaughtered
by
the
slitting
of
the
throat
raped
collectively
and
systematically
driven
out
of
their
homes
by
the
millions
tortured
in
concentration
camps
maimed
and
does
indeed
amount
to
moral
rape
nothing
in
the
history
justifies
whats
happening
