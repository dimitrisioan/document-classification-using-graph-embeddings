IF
YOU
EXAMINE
THESE
I
AM
SURE
YOU
WILL
DISCOVER
THAT
THE
ARAB
PARTY
MEMBER
DID
NOT
HAVE
THE
POWER
BASE
THAT
HIS
JEWISH
COUNTERPART
HAD
RIGHT
ARABS
HAVE
BEEN
VOTING
IN
ISRAEL
FOR
HOW
LONG
AND
IN
ALL
THAT
TIME
NOT
ONE
ARAB
EVER
GAINED
ENOUGH
OF
A
PERSONAL
FOLLOWING
TO
GET
HIS
FELLOW
PARTY
MEMBERS
TO
PUT
IN
A
MINISTRY
THIS
IS
ABOUT
AS
LIKELY
AS
SPROUTING
WINGS
AND
FLYING
TO
RIO
WHAT
BASIS
DO
YOU
HAVE
FOR
EXPLAINING
THIS
ODD
FAILURE
YOU
SEEM
VERY
CONFIDENT
THAT
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
EXACTLY
HOW
DO
YOU
KNOW
WHY
ARE
YOU
SURE
IT
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
HOW
LONG
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
VOTING
AS
MUCH
AS
HOW
THEY
HAVE
BEEN
VOTING
PICK
UP
A
LIST
OF
THE
LABOR
PARTIES
PROPOSALS
FOR
MK
PRIOR
TO
THE
ELECTION
AND
PAY
ATTENTION
TO
THE
ORDER
CORRELATE
THIS
WITH
THE
NUMBER
OF
ARAB
PARTY
MEMBERS
ELIGIBLE
TO
VOTE
IN
PARTY
ELECTIONS
FURTHER
CORRELATE
THIS
WITH
THE
VOTING
RESULTS
FROM
ARAB
AREAS
LO
AND
BEHOLD
YOU
WILL
DISCOVER
THAT
ISRAELI
ARAB
LABOR
PARTY
MEMBERS
DID
NOT
BAND
TOGETHER
UNANIMOUSLY
OR
EN
LARGE
FOR
A
SELECT
GROUP
OF
ARAB
CANDIDATES
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
FURTHER
EXACERBATED
BY
THE
RIFTS
BETWEEN
ISRAELI
ARABS
SOME
CLAIM
MEMBERSHIP
TO
RIGHT
WING
PARTIES
WHILE
OTHERS
VOTE
FOR
PARTIES
THAT
DO
NOT
PASS
THE
MINIMUM
CUTOFF
I
WORKED
WITHIN
THE
LABOR
PARTY
DURING
THE
LATE
ELECTIONS
NOT
THIS
LAST
ONE
AS
A
VOLUNTEER
AND
WAS
PRIVY
TO
THE
VOTING
RESULTS
THAT
WERE
RETURNED
FROM
THE
LOCAL
DELEGATES
ELECTED
AT
THE
TIME
THE
SYSTEM
WAS
STRUCTURED
DIFFERENTLY
BUT
IT
DID
NOT
CEASE
TO
AMAZE
ME
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
MASSIVE
EFFORT
TO
LOBBY
FOR
ARAB
REPS
BY
THEIR
OWN
DELEGATES
EXACTLY
WHAT
BASIS
DO
YOU
HAVE
FOR
SAYING
THIS
WHEN
THE
LABOUR
PARTY
HAS
NEVER
PUT
AN
ARAB
INTO
A
CABINET
POST
AND
INSISTS
ITS
COALITION
MEMBERS
DO
THE
SAME
WHY
AND
ON
WHAT
BASIS
ARE
YOU
REASSURING
ME
IN
THE
FACE
OF
YEARS
OF
DISCRIMINATORY
PRACTISE
QUITE
SIMPLY
IF
ALL
ELIGIBLE
ARAB
VOTERS
BECAME
MEMBERS
OF
THE
LABOR
PARTY
AND
VOTED
THEY
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
COMMAND
MORE
THAN
OF
THE
DELEGATES
THIS
IS
A
POWER
BASE
THAT
CAN
NOT
BE
IGNORED
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
THEY
ARE
NOT
RANKED
HIGH
IN
THE
PARTY
ONCE
AGAIN
DUE
TO
LACK
OF
POLITICAL
POWER
I
HAVE
SEEN
HOW
THE
LABOR
PARTY
WORKS
FROM
THE
INSIDE
AND
MY
EXPERIENCE
HAS
BEEN
THAT
AS
IN
MOST
POLITICAL
SITUATIONS
THE
MKS
ACT
OUT
OF
THEIR
OWN
SELFINTEREST
AND
TO
ANSWER
YOUR
QUESTION
I
BROKE
WITH
LABOR
BECAUSE
I
FELT
THAT
THEY
WERE
HEEDING
TOO
MUCH
TO
THE
RIGHTWING
AND
ULTRAORTHODOX
COALITION
MEMBERS
FROM
THE
OTHER
FRONT
JULY
TRANSLATION
OF
HAARETZ
ARTICLE
RACISM
IN
THE
KNESSET
THIS
ATTITUDE
WHICH
UNTIL
RECENTLY
HAD
NOT
EVEN
AROUSED
CRITICISM
BEING
SO
NATURAL
AND
SO
DEEPLYEMBOSSED
UPON
PEOPLES
HEARTS
HOLDS
THAT
THERE
ARE
KNESSET
MEMBERS
WHO
DESPITE
HAVING
BEEN
ELECTED
BY
TENS
OF
THOUSANDS
OF
VOTES
ARE
NOT
ENTITLED
TO
BE
FULL
PARTNERS
IN
THE
BODY
WHICH
REPRESENTS
THE
PEOPLE
OF
ISRAEL
WE
ARE
NOT
SPEAKING
HERE
OF
POLITICAL
DISCRIMINATION
WHICH
WOULD
BE
BAD
ENOUGH
IN
ITSELF
BUT
OF
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
THE
PROOF
ONE
OF
THE
COMPROMISES
PROPOSED
WAS
THAT
MK
MAHAMID
AN
ARAB
YIGAL
SHOULD
BE
REPLACED
BY
TAMAR
GOJANSKI
A
JEW
YIGAL
FROM
THE
SAME
PARTY
IT
WAS
NOT
THE
MEMBERS
PARTY
WHICH
WAS
CONSIDERED
UNFIT
BUT
HIS
RACE
FAIR
ENOUGH
MY
TAKE
ON
THE
MATTER
AND
I
WILL
ADMIT
TO
THE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THIS
MIGHT
BE
SEEN
DIFFERENTLY
IS
THAT
THIS
WAS
A
DUMMY
ARGUMENT
IF
HE
WAS
SITTING
ON
THE
COMMITTEE
THEN
SOMEONE
ELSE
OBVIOUSLY
WOULD
NOT
BE
IN
DRUMMING
UP
SUPPORT
FOR
HIS
SEAT
MK
WOULD
NOT
BE
AVERSE
TO
USING
THIS
ARGUMENT
OR
IT
COULD
BE
USED
ON
HIS
BEHALF
AS
TO
THE
PROOF
PRESENTED
IN
THIS
ARTICLE
I
WOULD
FIND
IT
VERY
INTERESTING
TO
KNOW
WHO
PROPOSED
THE
COMPROMISE
ALONG
WITH
A
FOLLOWUP
DESCRIBING
HOW
THE
MATTER
STANDSWAS
RESOLVED
LET
ME
JUST
TAKE
THIS
OPPORTUNITY
TO
SAY
THAT
I
DEPLORE
SUCH
ACTIONS
AND
GROUNDLESS
JUSTIFICATIONS
A
TEST
OF
SELFCONFIDENCE
BY
GIDON
LEVI
HAARETZ
JULY
BUT
NOT
TO
WORRY
EVEN
NOW
THE
JEWISH
MIND
IS
CONTRIVING
DEVICES
THE
NEW
COMMITTEE
CHAIR
RONI
MILO
HAS
ALREADY
ANNOUNCED
THAT
HE
WILL
SET
UP
SUBCOMMITTEES
APLENTY
FOR
HIS
COMMITTEE
THUS
HE
WILL
DECIDE
WHERE
IT
IS
PERMISSIBLE
FOR
MAHAMID
TO
PARTICIPATE
AND
WHERE
NOT
A
SOLUTION
SUCH
AS
THIS
COULD
BY
THE
WAY
ALSO
HAVE
BEEN
ADOPTED
FOR
THE
REST
OF
THE
COMMITTEES
THEREBY
COMPLETELY
ELIMINATING
THE
FEAR
OF
STATE
SECRETS
BEING
LEAKED
TO
THE
ENEMY
AND
REMOVING
THE
STAIN
OF
DISCRIMINATION
FROM
THE
KNESSET
FOR
THE
RECORD
RONI
MILO
IS
A
BRASH
MK
SELF
DESCRIBED
FROM
THE
LIKUD
NOTE
NOT
LABOR
QUITE
FRANKLY
I
DONT
THINK
ANYTHING
HE
WOULD
SAY
COULD
SURPRISE
ME
ANNOY
AND
AGGRAVATE
YES
SURPRISE
NO
DO
YOU
ACCEPT
THAT
AS
DOCUMENTATION
YES
I
DO
AND
THANK
YOU
FOR
PROVIDING
IT
I
WOULD
BE
