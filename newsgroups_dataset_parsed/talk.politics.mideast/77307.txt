THE

CONDEMENING
THE
EUROPEAN
LACK
OF
ACTION
AND
LACK
OF

TO

PLANS

CALLING
THAT
MORAL

WHAT

MOHAMED
I
TOO
NOTICED
THAT
IN

THIS
SCREAMING

SHOUTING
NOT
ONE
PERSON
BROUGHT
UP
THE
QUESTION
OF
ATROCITIES
BEING
COMMITED
ON
NONMUSLIMS
BY
THE
SUDANESE
GOVERNMENT
COULD
IT
BE
THAT
THEY
ARE
AFRICANS
AND
SO
WHO
CARES
I
SUGGEST
THAT
EVERYONE
CUT
THE
HYPOCRISY
AND
BLEATING
ABOUT
BOSNIA
AND
GO
ON
TO
DISCUSS
SOMETHING
EVEN
MORE
MEANINGLESS
THE
REPORT
BELOW
SHOWS
THAT
THE
SUDANESE
ARE
ACTING
IN
THE
FINEST
TRADITIONS
OF
ISLAMIC
LAW
AS
EXPOUNDED
BY
SOME
DIEHARD
PEOPLE
ON

SHALL
REMAIN
