IM
SURPRISED
THAT
YOU
DONT
CONSIDER
THE
ACQUISITION
OF
LAND
BY
THE
JEWS
FROM
ARABS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ESTABLISHING
AN
EXCLUSIVE
STATE
AS
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
LEADING
TO
WAR
IT
WAS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ESTABLISHING
A
STATE
NOT
AN
EXCLUSIVE
STATE
IF
THE
STATE
WAS
TO
BE
EXCLUSIVE
IT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
ARAB
CITIZENS
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHAT
WAS
THE
ETHNIC
COMPOSITION
OF
ISRAEL
RIGHT
AFTER
IT
WAS
FORMED
AND
NO
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THE
PURCHASE
OF
LAND
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
WHEN
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
BUY
LAND
AND
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
WILLING
TO
SELL
IT
AT
A
MUTUALLY
AGREEABLE
PRICE
THEN
THAT
IS
COMMERCE
IT
IS
NOT
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
LEADING
TO
WAR
NO
ONE
IN
HIS
RIGHT
MIND
WOULD
SELL
HIS
FREEDOM
AND
DIGNITY
PALESTINIANS
ARE
NO
EXCEPTION
PERHAPS
YOU
HEARD
ABOUT
ANTITRUST
IN
THE
BUSINESS
WORLD
SINCE
WE
ARE
DEBATING
THE
LEGALITY
OF
A
COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTION
WE
MUST
USE
THE
LAWS
GOVERNING
THE
GUIDELINES
AND
ETHICS
OF
SUCH
TRANSACTIONS
BASIC
ANTITRUST
LAW
SAYS
THAT
WHILE
YOU
CAN
PURCHASE
IBM
STOCKS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
INVESTING
YOU
CAN
NOT
ACQUIRE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
THOSE
SHARES
WITH
THE
INTENT
OR
CONTROLLING
IBM
YOU
CAN
DO
SO
ONLY
IF
YOU
MAKE
YOUR
INTENTIONS
CLEAR
APRIORI
CLEARLY
THE
JEWS
WHO
PURCHASED
PROPERTIES
FROM
PALASTENIANS
HAD
SOME
DESIGNS
THEY
WERE
NOT
BUYING
A
DWELLING
OR
A
REAL
ESTATE
THEY
WERE
ESTABLISHING
A
BRIDGEHEAD
FOR
THE
EUROPEAN
JEWS
THE
PALASTENIANS
SOLD
THEIR
PROPERTIES
TO
THE
JEWS
IN
THE
OLD
TRADITION
OF
ARAB
HOSPITALITY
BEING
A
MULTIETHNIC
MULTIRELIGIOUS
SOCIETY
ACCEPTING
THE
JEWS
AS
NEIGHBOURS
WAS
NO
DIFFERENT
JUST
ANOTHER
RELIGION
PLUS
THEY
PAID
FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
ETC
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
THEY
WERE
VICTIMS
OF
AN
INTERNATIONAL
CONSPIRACY
IM
NOT
A
CONSPIRACY
THEORIST
MYSELF
BUT
THIS
ONE
IS
HARD
TO
DISMISS
RIGHT
NOW
IM
JUST
GOING
TO
ADDRESS
THIS
POINT
WHEN
THE
JEWISH
NATIONAL
FUND
BOUGHT
MOST
OF
ITS
LAND
IT
DIDNT
BUY
IT
FROM
THE
PALESTINIANS
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THEY
WERE
TENANT
FARMERS
FALLAHIN
LIVING
ON
LAND
OWNED
BY
WEALTHY
ARABS
IN
SYRIA
AND
LEBANON
THE
JNF
OFFERED
A
PREMIUM
DEAL
SO
THE
OWNERS
TOOK
ADVANTAGE
OF
IT
ITS
CALLED
COMMERCE
THE
OWNERS
HOWEVER
MADE
NO
PROVISIONS
FOR
THOSE
WHO
HAD
WORKED
FOR
THEM
BASICALLY
SHAFTING
THEM
BY
SELLING
THE
LAND
RIGHT
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THEM
THEY
ARE
TO
BLAME
NOT
