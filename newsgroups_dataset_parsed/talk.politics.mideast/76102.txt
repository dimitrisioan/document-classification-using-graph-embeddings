SHAI
GUDAY
WRITES
THAT
IS
WHAT
IS
SO
HARD
OF
SOUTH
LEBANON
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
FIGHTING
AN
ARMY
WITH
WELL
DRAWN
BATTLE
LINES
BUT
A
GUERILLA
TYOE
RESISTANCE
WHICH
BY
DEFINITION
AND
NECESSITY
BLENDS
WITH
THE
LOCAL
POPULACE
NOT
BECAUSE
THEY
ARE
EVIL
COWARDS
THAT
USE
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
AS
SHIELDS
BUT
BECAUSE
THAT
IS
THE
ONLY
WAY
ONE
CAN
FIGHT
A
MORE
POWERFUL
BETTER
EQUIPPED
OCCUPYING
ARMY
WHILE
THAT
IS
CURRENTLY
TRUE
FROM
THEIR
PERSPECTIVE
IT
IS
ALSO
WORTHWHILE
TO
NOTE
THAT
IN
SUCH
CASES
THE
POPULACE
OFTEN
DOES
SUFFER
FROM
ATTEMPTS
TO
CONTROL
THE
GUERILLAS
FURTHERMORE
THERE
WERE
CASES
IN
THE
PAST
OF
PALESTINIAN
GUN
EMPLACEMENTS
BEING
SITUATED
WITHIN
VILLAGES
THE
ARGUMENT
THAT
CAN
BE
MADE
FOR
SMALL
ARMS
FIRE
CAN
NOT
BE
MADE
FOR
FIELD
PIECES
HIZBOLLAH
AND
AMAL
ARE
NOW
THE
MAIN
TWO
MILITIAS
THOUGH
HIZBOLLAH
PEOPLE
TEND
TO
BE
MORE
COMMITTED
TO
RESISTRANCE
OPERATION
AND
BETTER
MOTIVATED
BY
RELIGIOUS
CONVICTION
AS
I
RECALL
AMAL
WAS
PRIMARILY
NATIONALISTICALLY
LEBANON
FOR
THE
LEBANESE
MOTIVATED
I
THINK
THAT
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THEM
WAS
ALSO
A
MATTER
OF
FUNDING
AND
SUPPORT
ONE
QUESTION
DOES
COME
TO
MIND
HOWEVER
GIVEN
THAT
YOU
CLAIM
THE
HIZBOLLAH
TO
BE
MORE
COMMITTED
ETC
AND
THAT
THEIR
STATED
POSITION
IS
NO
PEACE
TALKS
NO
PEACE
TALKS
NO
PEACE
TALKS
N
NO
ISRAEL
IF
WE
ASSUME
THAT
LEBANON
AND
SYRIA
ARE
SINCERE
IN
THEIR
DESIRE
FOR
PEACE
WHY
HASNT
THE
HIZBOLLAH
BEEN
DISARMED
I
HOPE
YOU
ARE
RIGHT
ON
ISRAELI
WILLINGNESS
TO
WITHDRAW
BUT
I
STILL
CONTEND
THAT
WITHDRAWAL
WOULD
BE
THE
BETTER
COURSE
FOR
ISRAELS
SECURITY
SINCE
IT
WOULD
REDUCE
ITS
MILITARY
LOSSES
AND
I
CLAIM
THAT
THE
LEBANESE
AND
SYRIAN
GOVTS
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
PREVENT
ANY
FURTHER
ATTACKS
ON
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
BEARING
IN
MIND
THE
ABOVE
AND
THAT
MILITARY
LOSSES
ARE
MORE
PALATABLE
THAN
CIVILIAN
ONES
I
AM
SURE
YOU
CAN
UNDERSTAND
WHY
ISRAEL
IS
SLOW
TO
ACT
IN
THAT
MANNER
NO
THE
SYRIAN
GOVT
IS
MORE
THAN
HAPPY
TO
HAVE
ISRAEL
SINK
INTO
ANOTHER
LEBANESE
MORASS
I
COULD
ELABORATE
IF
NECESSARY
HMM
HERE
WE
DISAGREE
ON
WHAT
SERVES
SYRIA
INTERESTS
BETTER
I
THINK
SYRIA
WANTS
TO
HAVE
LEBANON
ALL
TO
ITSELF
IT
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
GUARANTEE
NORTHERN
ISRAELS
SECURITY
IN
RETURN
FOR
ISRAELI
WITHDRAWAL
I
DONT
THINK
SYRIA
WANTS
ISRAEL
TO
BE
INVOLVED
IN
ITS
PROTECTORATE
OF
LEBANON
SYRIA
IS
SITTING
AT
THE
NEGOTIATING
TABLE
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
COME
TO
ACCEPT
THAT
AND
WANTS
TO
GET
A
POLITICAL
RESOLUTION
A
RENEWAL
OF
HOSTILITIES
ALONG
THE
LEBANESE
FRONT
COULD
PUT
THE
WHOLE
ME
PEACE
NEGOTIATIONS
BACK
IN
QUESTION
I
AGREE
THAT
SYRIA
WANTS
LEBANON
TO
BE
PART
OF
ITS
GREATER
SYRIA
I
DONT
NECESSARILY
SEE
THAT
THE
SYRIANS
WOULD
BE
UNHAPPY
TO
SEE
ISRAEL
UP
TO
ITS
NECK
IN
ANOTHER
LEBANESE
MORASS
AFTERWHICH
SYRIA
COULD
CONTINUE
ON
ITS
MERRY
SCHEDULE
WHEN
ISRAELI
PUBLIC
OPINION
WOULD
LEAD
TO
A
SECOND
PULLOUT
I
AGREE
THAT
THE
LOSS
OF
ANY
HUMAN
LIFE
IS
DEPLORABLE
AND
REGRETTABLE
SIGH
WHY
CANT
SOME
GOVTS
NEGOTIATE
