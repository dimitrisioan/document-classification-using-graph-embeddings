RE

IN
JEWISH
QUARTER
WAS
RE
ISRAELI
DESTRUCTION
OF
IN
ARTICLE
BOB
BLACKSHAW
WRITES
I
ALWAYS
BELIEVED
THE
STATEMENT
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
KNOW
THEIR
HISTORY
ARE
CONDEMNED
TO
REPEAT
IT
WILL
DURANT
BUT
I
AM
BEGINNING
TO
BELIEVE
THE
OPPOSITE
IS
TRUE
HERE
IN
TPM
AND
IN
OTHER
NEWSGROUPS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
HISTORY
IS
MAINLY
REMEMBERED
TO
FOMENT
HATRED
OR
TO
BE
USED
AS
A
CLUB
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
MY
OWN
PEOPLE
THERE
ARE
AMPLE
ACTS
OF
SHAME
BOTH
DONE
BY
MY
PEOPLE
AND
DONE
TO
MY
PEOPLE
SINCE
I
WAS
NOT
PARTY
TO
ANY
OF
THOSE
ACTS
I
REFUSE
TO
ACCEPT
BLAME
FOR
THE
EVIL
ACTS
THAT
MY
ANCESTORS
COMMITTED
NOR
DO
I
DIRECT
HATRED
TOWARD
THE
DESCENDANTS
OF
THOSE
WHO
COMMITTED
EVIL
ACTS
AGAINST
MY
ANCESTORS
THE
OBSESSION
WITH
DISCUSSIONS
OF
PAST
OR
PRESENT
EVENTS
SEEMS
TO
BE
LARGELY
CENTERED
ON
TRYING
TO
PROVE
THAT
THEY
ARE
WORSE
THAN
US
AS
WE
SEE
OVER
AND
OVER
THAT
LEADS
NOWHERE
EXCEPT
TO
MAKE
OURSELVES
FEEL
SUPERIOR
ITS
AS
IF
WEVE
BECOME
ADDICTED
TO
PERIODIC
INJECTIONS
OF
SELFAFFIRMATION
THAT
DRAW
THEIR
POWER
FROM
DENIGRATION
OF
THE
OTHER
AND
ROMANTICIZATION
OF
OURSELVES
THE
HOPE
IS
THAT
WE
WILL
BEGIN
SOMETIME
TO
APPLY
THESE
DISCUSSIONS
IN
SOME
WAY
TOWARDS
CONSIDERATION
OF
HOW
TO
DEFUSE
THE
SITUATION
ADVANCEMENT
OF
NEGOTIATIONS
AND
THE
SEARCH
FOR
COMMON
GROUND
BETWEEN
THE
PARTIES
INVOLVED
OF
COURSE
FOR
THIS
TO
HAPPEN
WE
CANT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
BEST
PATH
TO
MAKING
OURSELVES
FEEL
BETTER
IS
AT
THE
EXPENSE
OF
OTHERS
AS
LONG
AS
THOSE
VALUING
THE
COMING
TOGETHER
OF
OPPOSING
PARTIES
DO
NOT
PURSUE
THEIR
VISION
WITH
THE
SAME
PASSION
AS
DO
THOSE
POLARIZATION
