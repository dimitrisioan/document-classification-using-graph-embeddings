nobody
knows
his
name
i
dont
mean
to
sound
disrespectful
but
since
the
majority
of
the
contributors
and
may
be
even
readers
of
this
newsgroup
seem
to
be
muslims
christians
and
jews
my
question
could
be
of
some
interest
to
any
of
them
its
my
impression
that
both
islam
and
christianity
pay
great
respect
to
an
obscure
century
jewish
lad
from
judeagalilee
why
they
chose
this
particular
jew
among
all
possible
jews
is
a
mystery
to
me
personally
i
prefer
woody
allen
his
stories
are
much
juicier
but
perhaps
its
an
accident
of
history
anyway
it
seems
that
they
may
be
talking
about
two
different
jews
according
to
the
new
testament
his
fathers
name
was
joseph
while
in
quran
he
appears
as
zachariah
whos
right
and
why
the
name
difference
im
really
curious
david
