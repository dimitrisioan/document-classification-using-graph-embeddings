WITHDREW
FROM

ANATOLIA
AFTER
THE

DEFEAT
ARMENIAN
REVOLUTIONARIES
INITIATED
A
SERIES
OF
CRUELTIES
IN
THIS
AREA
ALTHOUGH
THE
RUSSIANS
OCCUPIED
EASTERN
ANATOLIA
AS
AN
ENEMY
NEVERTHELESS
THEY
WERE
CONSTRAINED
BY
THE
RULES
OF
WAR
HOWEVER
WHEN
THEY
RETURNED
TO
THEIR
COUNTRY
IN
AFTER
THE
REVOLUTION
ARMENIAN
REVOLUTIONARIES
WERE
UNCHECKED
IN
THIS
AREA
FOR
ABOUT
A
YEAR
UNTIL
THE
OTTOMAN
FORCES
RETURNED
TO
ERZURUM
IN
DURING
THIS
PERIOD
ARMENIAN
REVOLUTIONARIES
EXECUTED
MASSACRES
ON
THE
LOCAL
PEOPLE
WHICH
IS
RECORDED
IN
HISTORICAL
FOR
EXAMPLE
LET
US
LOOK
AT
A
REPORT
DATED
MARCH
WHICH
THE
COMMANDER
OF
THE
THIRD
ARMY
SUBMITTED
WHEN
HE
ENTERED
ERZURUM
AND
ERZINCAN
THEY
WERE
COMPLETELY
AND
SYSTEMATICALLY
DESTROYED
AND
BURNED
DOWN
BY
ARMENIANS
EVEN
THE
TREES
WERE
CUT
DOWN
AND
THEY
ARE
LIKE
A
BUILDING
ENTIRELY
CONSUMED
BY
FIRE
IN
EVERY
SENSE
OF
THE
WORD
AS
FOR
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
LIVING
IN
ERZURUM
AND
ERZINCAN
THOSE
WHO
WERE
CAPABLE
OF
FIGHTING
WERE
TAKEN
AWAY
AT
THE
VERY
BEGINNING
WITH
THE
EXCUSE
OF
FORCED
LABOR
IN
ROAD
CONSTRUCTION
THEY
WERE
TAKEN
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
SARIKAMIS
AND
ANNIHILATED
WHEN
THE
RUSSIAN
ARMY
WITHDREW
A
PART
OF
THE
REMAINING
PEOPLE
WAS
DESTROYED
IN
ARMENIAN
MASSACRES
AND
CRUELTIES
THEY
WERE
THROWN
INTO
WELLS
THEY
WERE
LOCKED
IN
HOUSES
AND
BURNED
DOWN
THEY
WERE
KILLED
WITH
BAYONETS
AND
SWORDS
IN
PLACES
SELECTED
AS
BUTCHERING
SPOTS
THEIR
BELLIES
WERE
TORN
OPEN
THEIR
LUNGS
WERE
PULLED
OUT
AND
GIRLS
AND
WOMEN
WERE
HANGED
BY
THEIR
HAIR
AFTER
BEING
SUBJECTED
TO
EVERY
CONCEIVABLE
ABOMINABLE
ACT
A
VERY
SMALL
PART
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
SPARED
THESE
ABOMINATIONS
FAR
WORSE
THAN
THE
CRUELTY
OF
THE
INQUISITION
RESEMBLED
LIVING
DEAD
AND
WERE
SUFFERING
FROM
TEMPORARY
INSANITY
BECAUSE
OF
THE
DIRE
POVERTY
THEY
HAD
LIVED
IN
AND
BECAUSE
OF
THE
FRIGHTFUL
EXPERIENCES
THEY
HAD
BEEN
SUBJECTED
TO
INCLUDING
WOMEN
AND
CHILDREN
SUCH
PERSONS
DISCOVERED
SO
FAR
DO
NOT
EXCEED
ONE
THOUSAND
FIVE
HUNDRED
IN
ERZINCAN
AND
THIRTY
THOUSAND
IN
ERZURUM
ALL
THE
FIELDS
IN
ERZINCAN
AND
ERZURUM
ARE
UNTILLED
EVERYTHING
THAT
THE
PEOPLE
HAD
HAS
BEEN
TAKEN
AWAY
FROM
THEM
AND
WE
FOUND
THEM
IN
A
DESTITUTE
SITUATION
AT
THE
PRESENT
TIME
THE
PEOPLE
ARE
SUBSISTING
ON
SOME
FOOD
THEY
OBTAINED
IMPELLED
BY
STARVATION
FROM
RUSSIAN
STORAGES
LEFT
BEHIND

THEIR
OCCUPATION

THIS
FOREIGN
OBSERVERS

SUBMITTED
DETAILED
REPORTS
PROVING
THE
GENOCIDE
TO
OTTOMAN
COMMANDERS
WHO
RECEIVED
THEM
AS

WHAT
IS
MOST
IMPORTANT
IS
THAT
THEY
STATED

NOT
HAPPEN
