A
REPORTER
WRITES
BUT
LAST
YEAR
IRAN
QUIETLY
TOOK
OVER
FOUR
ISLANDS
BELONGING
TO
THE
UNITED
ARAB
EMIRATES
AND
DEPORTED
THEIR
PEOPLE
WITH
HARDLY
A
PROTEST
FROM
THE
UNITED
STATES
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
WHAT
THIS
IS
REFERRING
TO
I
SEEM
TO
HAVE
MISSED
IT
SPIKED
NO
DOUBT
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
IN
THE
NYT
AND
OTHER
SOURCES
ABOUT
THIS
FOR
A
FEW
DAYS
IT
IS
AN
ONGOING
BORDER
DISUPUTE
AND
WHEN
THE
IRANIANS
KICKED
OUT
THE
UAE
PEOPLE
IT
WAS
BRIEFLY
REPORTED
THIS
WAS
MANY
MOONS
AGO
I
DONT
RECALL
READING
OF
ANY
PUBLIC
US
COMMENT
IF
IT
WERE
A
STRONG
PROTEST
I
PROBABLY
WOULD
HAVE
SEEN
IT
THOSE
ISLANDS
WOULD
BE
ABU
MUSA
AND
THE
GREATER
AND
LESSER
TUNBS
I
PRESUME
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
A
FOURTH
THE
LATTER
TWO
ISLANDS
BELONG
TO
IRAN
AND
SO
ACCORDING
TO
THE
NY
TIMES
THE
ISLANDS
BELONG
TO
THE
UNITED
ARAB
EMIRATES
COULD
NOT
BE
TAKEN
OVER
THE
MAJOR
ROW
IS
OVER
ABU
MUSA
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
JOINTLY
ADMINISTERED
BY
IRAN
AND
UAE
THE
DISPUTE
GOES
BACK
TO
THE
EARLY
WHEN
BRITAIN
EVACUATED
THE
ISLAND
AND
IRAN
UNDER
THE
SHAH
RECLAIMED
THE
ISLAND
WHICH
HAD
HISTORICAL
TIES
TO
IRAN
NO
BRITISH
OBJECTION
WAS
RAISED
AT
THAT
TIME
IT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
UAE
RESIDENTS
OF
ABU
MUSA
ARE
CURRENTLY
FREE
TO
TRAVEL
TO
AND
FROM
THE
ISLAND
AND
THAT
IRAN
IS
DESIRING
DIPLOMATIC
RESOLUTION
OF
THE
DISPUTE
WHY
IS
IT
THEN
THAT
WHEN
THE
BRITISH
IRANIANS
AND
UAE
REFER
TO
OCCUPIED
TERRITORY
THEY
MEAN
TERRITORY
IN
DISPUTE
IN
ISRAEL
BUT
NOT
IN
THEIR
OWN
AFFAIRS
