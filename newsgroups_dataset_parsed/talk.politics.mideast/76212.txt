I
UNDERSTAND
HOW
ISRAEL
CAPTURED
THE
TERITORY
AND
FEELS
THAT
IT
IS
ITS
RIGHT
TO
ANNEX
IT
I
CANT
FULLY
UNDERSTAND
WHY
IT
HAS
TO
DEAL
WITH
PALESTINIANS
MUCH
THE
SAME
WAY
JEWS
WERE
TREATED
BEFORE

HOLOCAUST

FINAL
SOLUTION

HITLER

I
TOTALLY
DONT
GET

WHY
THE

HAS
TO
SUBSIDIZE
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
SUCH
A
THOROUGH
ABUSER
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
JUST
WONDERING
SEEMS
THAT
YOURE
MORE
JUST
MISINFORMED
THAN
JUST
WONDERING
THE
COMPARISON
YOURE
MAKING
IS

ALL
