i
understand
how
israel
captured
the
teritory
and
feels
that
it
is
its
right
to
annex
it
i
cant
fully
understand
why
it
has
to
deal
with
palestinians
much
the
same
way
jews
were
treated
before
the
holocaust
the
final
solution
by
hitler
what
i
totally
dont
get
is
why
the
us
has
to
subsidize
the
existance
of
such
a
thorough
abuser
of
human
rights
just
wondering
seems
that
youre
more
just
misinformed
than
just
wondering
the
comparison
youre
making
is
not
just
totally
off
base
but
offensive
to
all
sane
people
