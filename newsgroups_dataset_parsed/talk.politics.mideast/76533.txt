RE
UNCONVENTIONAL
PEACE
PROPOSAL
IN
ARTICLE
CENTER

POLICY
RESEARCH
CPRIGCAPCORG
WRITES
THE
IDEA
OF
PROVIDING
FINANCIAL
INCENTIVES
TO
SELECTED
FORMS
OF
PARTNERSHIP
AND
MARRIAGE
IS
NOT
CONVENTIONAL
HOWEVER
IT
IS
BASED
ON
THE
CONCEPT
OF
AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION
WHICH
IS
RECOGNIZED
AS
A
LEGITIMATE
FORM
OF
PUBLIC
POLICY
TO
REVERSE
THE
PERVERSE
EFFECTS
OF
SEGREGATION
AND
DISCRIMINATION
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALREADY
SHOWN
THIS
TO
BE
A
REDICULOUS
PROPOSAL
HOWEVER
I
WANTED
TO
POINT
OUT
THAT
THERE
ARE
MANY
PEOPLE
WHO
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
AFFIRMATIVE
ACTION
IS
A
EITHER
INTELLIGENT
OR
PRODUCTIVE
IT
IS
DEMEANING
TO
THOSE
WHO
IT
SUPPOSEDLY
HELPS
AND
IT
IS
DISCRIMINATORY
ANY
PROPOSAL
BASED
ON
IT
IS
LIKELY
BUNK
AS
WELL

IF

HAD
A

BIG
ENOUGH
FOR
DRUGS

WE
SURE
WOULDNT
WASTE
THEM
ON
