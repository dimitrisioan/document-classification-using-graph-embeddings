the

sorry
you
guys
in
israel
have
a
hard
time
with
the
concept
jefferson
was
not
the
author
of
the
bill
of
rights
my
history
books
arent
here
but
jefferson
might
have
been
in
the
group
that
did
not
think
that
enumerating
rights
was
necessary

owwww
mr
jefferson
would
be
clearly
disappointed
in
your
designation
of
him
as
author
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
your
reference
to
those
in
israel
was
condesceding
and
inappropriate
the
declaratio
of
independence
of
was
written
by
thomas
jefferson
in
the
constitution
was
drafted
by
men
in
philadelphia
in
the
bill
of
rights
was
added
well
maybe
jefferson
would
be
flattered
as
to
you
guys
at
uva
your
right
not
all
of
you
are
antijewish
or
selfhating
but
when
i
visited
charlottesville
i
noticed
a
distinct
lack
of
diversity
from
which
i
must
assume
you
garner
your
inability
to
perceive
the
reality
of
the
outside
world
