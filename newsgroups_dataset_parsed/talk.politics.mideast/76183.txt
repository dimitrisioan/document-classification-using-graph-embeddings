unlike
the
plos
almost
exclusive
focus
on
civilian
targets
the
troups
from
the
irgun
and
stern
group
that
struck
at
deir
yassin
on
april
targeted
the
village
for
its
military
importance
deir
yassin
was
on
the
road
to
jerusalem
which
the
arabs
had
blockaded
and
it
housed
iraqi
troups
and
palestinian
irregulars
snipers
based
in
deir
yassin
were
a
constant
threat
to
jewish
citizens
in
jerusalem
arab
civilians
were
killed
at
deir
yassin
but
that
attack
does
not
conform
to
the
propaganda
picture
that
the
arabs
have
tried
to
paint
the
number
of
arabs
killed
was
generally
reported
to
be
about
in
however
eric
silver
of
the
guardian
britain
interviewed
a
survivor
mophammed
sammour
who
testified
that
out
of
a
population
of
were
killed
about
three
days
after
the
massacre
sammour
explained
representatives
of
each
of
the
five
clans
in
deir
yassin
met
at
the
moslem
offices
in
jerusalem
and
made
a
list
of
the
people
who
had
not
been
found
alive
we
went
through
the
names
nothing
has
happend
since
to
make
me
think
this
figure
was
wrong
unlike
the
plos
deliberate
attacks
on
civilians
the
killing
of
civilians
at
deir
yassin
was
not
premeditated
the
attackers
left
open
an
escape
corridor
from
the
village
and
more
than
residents
left
unharmed
after
the
remaining
arabs
feigned
surrender
and
then
fired
on
the
jewish
troops
some
of
the
attackers
killed
arab
soldiers
and
civilians
indiscriminately
independent
observers
told
the
guardian
that
among
the
bodies
they
found
arab
men
disguised
as
women
