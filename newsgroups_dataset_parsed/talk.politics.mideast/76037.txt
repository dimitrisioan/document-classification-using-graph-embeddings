RE
WHY
DOES
US
CONSIDER
YIGAL
ARENS
TO
BE
A
DANGEROUS
TO
HUMANITY
IN
ARTICLE
EDWARD
A
SHNEKENDORF
WRITES
COME
ON
MOST
IF
NOT
ALL
ARABS
ARE
SYMPATHETIC
TO
THE
PALESTINIAN
WAR
AGAINST
ISRAEL
I
WOULDNT
BET
ON
IT
ARAB
GOVERNMENTS
GENERALLY
DONT
CARE
MUCH
ABOUT
THE
PALESTINEANS
AND
THEIR
STRUGGLE
BUT
FIND
IT
USEFUL
FOR
POLITICAL
PURPOSES
BACK
HOME
THEY
ARE
HAPPY
TO
LEAVE
THE
PALESTINEANS
LARGELY
UNDER
ISRAELI
CONTROL
BECAUSE
THAT
LEAVES
THE
JOB
OF
CONTROLLING
THEM
TO
THE
ISRAELIS
THE
ISRAELIS
DONT
LIKE
THIS
JOB
ANY
MORE
THAN
KING
HUSSEIN
OF
JORDAN
LIKED
IT
AND
HE
MANAGED
TO
KILL
THEM
OFF
AT
THE
RATE
OF
THOUSANDS
PER
MONTH
WHEN
THEY
STARTED
AN
INTIFADA
IN
JORDAN
THE
GOVERNMENTS
OF
SYRIA
LEBANON
AND
EGYPT
ALL
FEEL
SIMILARLY
HOWEVER
PROCLAIMING
PUBLIC
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
PALESTINEAN
WAR
AGAINST
ISRAEL
DEFLECTS
CRITICISM
FROM
DEEP
PROBLEMS
AT
HOME
AND
LENDS
AN
AIR
OF
LEGITIMACY
TO
EVEN
THE
MOST
BRUTAL
ARAB
TYRANTS
ARAB
PEOPLE
PROBABLY
ARENT
MUCH
MORE
SYMPATHETIC
PALESTINEANS
HAVE
SHOWN
A
WILLINGNESS
TO
DESTABILIZE
AND
PLUNDER
IN
JORDAN
LEBANON
AND
KUWAIT
AND
ARE
VIEWED
WITH
SUSPICION
ELSEWHERE
YOU
MIGHT
STILL
BE
RIGHT
IN
SYMPATHY
TO
THE
WAR
AGAINST
ISRAEL
BUT
I
SUSPECT
THAT
MANY
ARABS
FAR
REMOVED
FROM
THE
IMMEDIATE
BORDER
WITH
ISRAEL
EG
IN
KUWAIT
OR
MORROCO
COULDNT
CARE
LESS
JAKE
LIVNI
TEN
YEARS
FROM
NOW
GEORGE
