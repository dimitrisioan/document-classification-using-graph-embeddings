WRITES
NO
ONE
IN
HIS
RIGHT
MIND
WOULD
SELL
HIS
FREEDOM
AND
DIGNITY
PALESTINIANS
ARE
NO
EXCEPTION
PERHAPS
YOU
HEARD
ABOUT
ANTITRUST
IN
THE
BUSINESS
WORLD
SINCE
WE
ARE
DEBATING
THE
LEGALITY
OF
A
COMMERCIAL
TRANSACTION
WE
MUST
USE
THE
LAWS
GOVERNING
THE
GUIDELINES
AND
ETHICS
OF
SUCH
TRANSACTIONS
BASIC
ANTITRUST
LAW
SAYS
THAT
WHILE
YOU
CAN
PURCHASE
IBM
STOCKS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
INVESTING
YOU
CAN
NOT
ACQUIRE
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
THOSE
SHARES
WITH
THE
INTENT
OR
CONTROLLING
IBM
YOU
CAN
DO
SO
ONLY
IF
YOU
MAKE
YOUR
INTENTIONS
CLEAR
APRIORI
CLEARLY
THE
JEWS
WHO
PURCHASED
PROPERTIES
FROM
PALASTENIANS
HAD
SOME
DESIGNS
THEY
WERE
NOT
BUYING
A
DWELLING
OR
A
REAL
ESTATE
THEY
WERE
ESTABLISHING
A
BRIDGEHEAD
FOR
THE
EUROPEAN
JEWS
THE
PALASTENIANS
SOLD
THEIR
PROPERTIES
TO
THE
JEWS
IN
THE
OLD
TRADITION
OF
ARAB
HOSPITALITY
BEING
A
MULTIETHNIC
MULTIRELIGIOUS
SOCIETY
ACCEPTING
THE
JEWS
AS
NEIGHBOURS
WAS
NO
DIFFERENT
JUST
ANOTHER
RELIGION
PLUS
THEY
PAID
FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
ETC
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
THEY
WERE
VICTIMS
OF
AN
INTERNATIONAL
CONSPIRACY
IM
NOT
A
CONSPIRACY
THEORIST
MYSELF
BUT
THIS
ONE
IS
HARD
TO
DISMISS
RIGHT
NOW
IM
JUST
GOING
TO
ADDRESS
THIS
POINT
WHEN
THE
JEWISH
NATIONAL
FUND
BOUGHT
MOST
OF
ITS
LAND
IT
DIDNT
BUY
IT
FROM
THE
PALESTINIANS
THEMSELVES
BECAUSE
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
THEY
WERE
TENANT
FARMERS
FALLAHIN
LIVING
ON
LAND
OWNED
BY
WEALTHY
ARABS
IN
SYRIA
AND
LEBANON
THE
JNF
OFFERED
A
PREMIUM
DEAL
SO
THE
OWNERS
TOOK
ADVANTAGE
OF
IT
ITS
CALLED
COMMERCE
THE
OWNERS
HOWEVER
MADE
NO
PROVISIONS
FOR
THOSE
WHO
HAD
WORKED
FOR
THEM
BASICALLY
SHAFTING
THEM
BY
SELLING
THE
LAND
RIGHT
OUT
FROM
UNDER
THEM
THEY
ARE
TO
BLAME
NOT
THE
JEWS
AMIR
WHY
WOULD
YOU
CATEGORIZE
THE
SALE
OF
LAND
AS
SHAFTING
WAS
IT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
SOLD
TO
JEWS
WAS
IT
FAIR
TO
ASSUME
THAT
THE
FALLAHIN
WOULD
BE
MISTREATED
BY
THE
JEWS
IS
THIS
THE
NORM
OF
ANY
COMMERCE
READ
SHAFTING
BETWEEN
ARABS
AND
JEWS
YOUR
CLAIM
THAT
THE
LEBANESESYRIAN
LANDLORDS
SOLD
PALESTINE
IF
TRUE
EVEN
PARTIALLY
OMITS
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
MANDATE
TREATY
PUT
LEBANON
AND
SYRIA
UNDER
FRENCH
RULE
WHILE
PALESTINE
UNDER
BRITISH
OBIVIOUSLY
ANY
SUCH
LANDLORD
WOULD
HAVE
FOUND
HIMSELF
A
FOREIGNER
IN
PALESTINE
AND
WOULD
BE
MOTIVATED
TO
SELL
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
PRICE
IT
IS
INTERESTING
THOUGH
THAT
YOU
ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT
THE
PALESTINIANS
WERE
SHAFTED
DO
MANY
ISRAELIS
OR
JEWS
SHARE
YOUR
OPINION
DO
YOU
ABSOLVE
THE
PURCHASER
FROM
ANY
ETHICAL
COMMITMENTS
JUST
BECAUSE
IT
WASNT
WRITTEN
DOWN
ALL
TOLD
I
DID
NOT
SEE
AN
ANSWER
IN
YOUR
RESPONSE
THE
QUESTION
WAS
WHETHER
THE
INTENT
BEHIND
THE
PURCHASE
WAS
AIMED
AT
CONTROLLING
THE
PUBLIC
ASSETS
LAND
INFRASTRUCTURE
ETC
IMHO
THE
PALESTINIANS
HAVE
GROUNDS
TO
CONTEST
THE
LEGALITY
OF
THE
PURCHASE
SAY
IN
WORLD
COURT
SAM
MY
OPINIONS
ARE
MY
OWN
AND
NO
ONE
ELSES
