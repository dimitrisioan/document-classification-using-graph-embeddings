ABOUT

ANYWAY
FURTHER
STRIKING
BIGOTED
AND
RACIST
ATTITUDE
OF
CERTAIN
GREEKS
STILL
EXISTS
IN

MOST
GREEKS
INSIST
EVEN
TODAY
THAT
THE

CAPITAL
OF
THE
OTTOMAN
EMPIRE
SHOULD
BE
CALLED
NOT
BY
ITS
RIGHTFUL
NAME
OF
ISTANBUL

KNOWS
THAT

DUTCH

DO
NOT

QUESTIONABLE
DEMOCRACY
WHY
DONT
THEY
SEEM
TO
RECONCILE
WITH
THE

FOR

THAT
ISTANBUL
CHANGED

THE
