EASY
FOR
SERBS
TO
PLAY
A
DIVIDEANDCONQUER
GAME
AND
TO
GET
THE
MUSLIMS
AND
CROATS
WHO
HAVE
STRONG
COMMON
IT
IS
THE
SERBS
WHO
WERE
DIVIDED
WHEN
CROATIA
AND
BOSNIAHERCEGOVINA
ATTEMPTED
TO
SECEDE
FROM
YUGOSLAVIA
RIPPING
MORE
THAN
SERBS
AND
THEIR
PROPERTY
OUT
OF
YUGOSLAVIA
IT
IS
THE
CROATS
THAT
WERE
DIVIDED
AT
LEAST
WERE
LEFT
IN
SERBIAN
PROVINCE
OF

IT
IS
THE

THE
SAME
RIGHT

BE
GIVEN
TO
CROATS
AND

IN
SERBIA
WHY
SHOULD
SERBIA
BE
EXEMPTED
