under
such
conditions
it
is
very
easy
for
serbs
to
play
a
divideandconquer
game
and
to
get
the
muslims
and
croats
who
have
strong
common
it
is
the
serbs
who
were
divided
when
croatia
and
bosniahercegovina
attempted
to
secede
from
yugoslavia
ripping
more
than
serbs
and
their
property
out
of
yugoslavia
it
is
the
croats
that
were
divided
at
least
were
left
in
serbian
province
of
vojvodina
it
is
the
muslims
that
were
divided
left
in
the
region
of
sanjak
that
now
belongs
to
serbia
if
the
serbs
in
croatia
and
bosniahercegovina
want
selfdetermination
the
same
right
should
be
given
to
croats
and
muslims
and
albanians
and
hungarians
in
serbia
why
should
serbia
be
exempted
