what
happened
in
sumgait
was
a
great
tragedy
an
awful
tragedy
for
us
the
armenian
people
and
for
all
of
mankind
a
genocide
of
armenians
took
place
during
peacetime
and
it
was
a
great
tragedy
for
me
personally
because
i
lost
my
father
in
those
days
he
was
still
young
born
in
on
that
day
february
we
were
at
home
of

we
had
heard
that
there
was
unrest
in
town
my
younger
brother
aleksandr
had
told
us
about
it
but
we
didnt
think
we
thought
that
everything
would
happen
outdoors
that
they
wouldnt
go
into
peoples
apartments
about
five
oclock
we
saw
a
large
crowd
near
the
kosmos
movie
theater
in
our
microdistrict

were
sitting
at
home

go
out

day
there
was
a
group
of

policemen
then
they
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
our

they
burned
a
motorcycle
in
our
courtyard
and
started
shouting
for
armenians
to
come
out
of
the
building
we
switched
off
the
light
as
it
turns
out
their
signal
was
just
the
opposite
to
turn
on
the
light
that
meant
that
it
was
an
azerbaijani
home
we
of
course
didnt
know
and
thought
that
if
they
saw
lights
on
they
would
come
to
our
apartment
suddenly
theres
pounding
on
the
door
we
go
to

apartment
and
grabbed
what
we
could
find
to
defend
ourselves
they
broke
in
the
door
and
when
the
door
gave
way
we
held
it
for
another
halfhour
no
neighbors
no
police
and
no
one
from
the
city
government
came
to
our
aid
the
whole
time
we
held
the
door
they
started
to
smash
the
door
on
the
lock
side
first
with
an
axe
and
then
with
a
crowbar
when
the
door
gave

pipes
and
special
rods
made
from
armature
shafts
one
of
them
hit
my
father
in
the
head
the
pressure
from
the
mob
was
immense
when
we
retreated
into
the
room
one
of
them
hit
my
mother
too
in
the
left
part
of
her
face
my
brother
sasha
and
i
fought
back
of
course
sasha
is
quite
strong
and
hottempered
he
was
the
judo
champion
of
sumgait
we
had
hammers
in
our
hands
and
we
injured
several
of
the
banditsin
the
heads
and
in
the
eyes
all
that
went
on
but
they
the
injured
ones
fell
back
and
others
came
to
take
their
places
there
were
many
of
them
the
door
fell
down
at
an
angle
the
mob
tried
to
remove
the
door
so
as
to
go
into
the
second
room
and
to
continue
to
finish
us
off
father
brought
skewers
and
gave
them
to
sasha
and
mewe
flew
at
them
when
we
saw
father
bleeding
his
face
was
covered
with
blood
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
head
and
his
whole
face
was
bloody
we
just
threw
ourselves
on
them
when
we
saw
that
we
threw
ourselves
at
the
mob
and
drove
back
the
ones
in
the
hall
drove
them
down
to
the
third
floor
we
came
out
on
the
landing
but
a
group
of
the
bandits
remained
in
one
of
the
rooms
they
were
smashing
all
the
furniture
in
there
having
closed
the
door
behind
them
we
started
tearing
the
door
off
to
chase
away
the
remaining
ones
or
finish
them
then
a
man
an
imposing
man
of
about
an
azerbaijani
came
in
when
he
was
coming
in
father
fell
down
and
mother
flew
to
him
and
started
to
cry
out
i
jumped
out
onto
the
balcony
and
started
calling
an
ambulance
but
then
the
mob
started
throwing
stones
through
the
windows
of
our
veranda
and
kitchen
we
live
on
the
fourth
floor
and
no
one
came
i
went
into
the
room
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
man
was
the
leader
of
the
group
he
was
respectably
dressed
in
a
hat
and
a
trench
coat
with
a
fur
collar
and
he
addressed
my
mother
in
azerbaijani
whats
with
you
woman
why
are
you
shouting
what
happened
why
are
you
shouting
like
that
she
says
what
do
you
mean
what
happened
you
killed
somebody
my
father
was
a
musician
he
played
the
clarinet
he
played
at
many
weddings
armenian
and
azerbaijani
he
played
for
many
years
everyone
knew
him
mother
says
the
person
who
you
killed
played
at
thousands
of
azerbaijani
weddings
he
brought
so
much
joy
to
people
and
you
killed
that
person
he
says
you
dont
need
to
shout
stop
shouting
and
when
they
heard
the
voice
of
this
man
the
to
people
who
were
in
the
other
room
opened
the
door
and
started
running
out
we
chased
after
them
but
they
ran
away
that
man
left
too
as
we
were
later
told
downstairs
one
of
them
told
the
others
i
dont
know
if
it
was
from
fright
or
what
told
them
that
we
had
firearms
even
though
we
only
fought
with
hammers
and
an
axe
we
raced
to
father
and
started
to
massage
his
heart
but
it
was
already
too
late
we
asked
the
neighbors
to
call
an
ambulance
the
ambulance
never
came
although
we
waited
for
it
all
evening
and
all
through
the
night
somewhere
around
midnight
about
policemen
came
they
informed
us
they
were
from
khachmas
they
said
we
heard
that
a
group
was
here
at
your
place
you
have
our
condolences
they
told
us
not
to
touch
anything
and
left
father
lay
in
the
room
so
we
stayed
home
each
of
us
took
a
hammer
and
a
knife
we
sat
at
home
well
we
say
if
they
descend
on
us
again
well
defend
ourselves
somewhere
around
one
oclock
in
the
morning
two
people
came
from
the
sumgait
procuracy
investigators
they
say

everything
just
how
it
is

coming
back
here
soon
and

expert
who
will
record
and
photograph

from
the
republic
procuracy

but
no
one
helped
us
take
father
away
the
morning
came
and
the
neighbors
arrived
we
wanted
to
take
father
away
somehow
we
called
the
procuracy
and
the
police
a
couple
of
times
but
no
one
came
we
called
an
ambulance
and
nobody
came
then
one
of
the
neighbors
said
that
the
bandits
were
coming
to
our
place
again
and
we
should
hide
we
secured
the
door
somehow
or
other
we
left
father
in
the
room
and
went
up
to
the
neighbors
the
excesses
began
again
in
the
morning
the
bandits
came
in
several
vehicles
zil
panel
trucks
and
threw
themselves
out
of
the
vehicles
like
a
landing
force
near
the
center
of
town
our
building
was
located
right
there
a
crowd
formed
then
they
started
fighting
with
the
soldiers
then
in
buildings
and
thats
next
to
the
airline
ticket
office
they
started
breaking
into
armenian
apartments
destroying
property
and
stealing
the
armenians
werent
at
home
they
had
managed
to
flee
and
hide
somewhere
and
again
they
poured
in
the
direction
of
our
building
they
were
shouting
that
there
were
some
armenians
left
on
the
fourth
floor
meaning
us
theyre
up
there
still
up
there
lets
go
kill
them
they
broke
up
all
the
furniture
remaining
in
the
two
rooms
threw
it
outside
and
burned
it
in
large
fires
we
were
hiding
one
floor
up
something
heavy
fell
sasha
threw
himself
toward
the
door
shouting
that
it
was
probably
father
they
had
thrown
father
were
defiling
the
corpse
probably
throwing
it
in
the
fire
going
to
burn
it
i
heard
it
and
the
sound
was
kind
of
hollow
and
i
said
no
thats
from
some
of
the
furniture
mother
and
i
pounced
on
sasha
and
stopped
him
somehow
and
calmed
him
down
the
mob
left
somewhere
around
eight
oclock
they
smashed
open
the
door
and
went
into
the
apartment
of
the
neighbors
across
from
us
they
were
also
armenians
they
had
left
for
another
city
the
father
of
the
neighbor
who
was
concealing
us
came
and
said
are
you
crazy
why
are
you
hiding
armenians
dont
you
now
theyre
checking
all
the
apartments
they
could
kill
you
and
them
and
to
us
come
on
leave
this
apartment
we
went
down
to
the
third
floor
to
some
other
neighbors
at
first
the
man
didnt
want
to
let
us
in
but
then
one
of
his
sons
asked
him
and
he
relented
we
stayed
there
until
eleven
oclock
at
night
we
heard
the
sound
of
motors
the
neighbors
said
that
it
was
armored
personnel
carriers
we
went
downstairs
there
was
a
light
on
in
the
room
where
we
left
father
in
the
other
rooms
as
we
found
out
later
all
the
chandeliers
had
been
torn
down
they
left
only
one
bulb
the
bulb
was
burning
which
probably
was
a
signal
they
had
agreed
on
because
there
was
a
light
burning
in
every
apartment
in
our
microdistrict
where
there
had
been
a
pogrom
with
the
help
of
the
soldiers
we
made
it
to
the
city
party
committee
and
were
saved
our
salvationmy
mothers
my
brothers
and
minewas
purely
accidental
because
as
we
later
found
out
from
the
neighbors
someone
in
the
crowd
shouted
that
we
had
firearms
up
there
well
we
fought
but
we
were
only
able
to
save
mother
we
couldnt
save
father
we
inflicted
many
injuries
on
the
bandits
some
of
them
serious
but
others
came
to
take
their
places
we
were
also
wounded
there
was
blood
and
we
were
scratched
all
overwe
got
our
share
it
was
a
miracle
we
survived
we
were
saved
by
a
miracle
and
the
troops
and
if
troops
hadnt
come
to
sumgait
the
slaughter
would
have
been
even
greater
probably
all
the
armenians
would
have
been
victims
of
the
genocide
through
an
acquaintance
at
the
city
party
committee
i
was
able
to
contact
the
leadership
of
the
military
unit
that
was
brought
into
the
city
and
at
their
orders
we
were
assigned
special
people
to
accompany
us
experts
we
went
to
pick
up
fathers
corpse
we
took
it
to
the
morgue
this
was
about
two
oclock
in
the
morning
it
was
already
march
it
was
raining
very
hard
and
it
was
quite
cold
and
we
were
wearing
only
our
suits
when
my
brother
and
i
carried
father
into
the
morgue
we
saw
the
burned
and
disfigured
corpses
there
were
about
six
burned
people
in
there
and
the
small
corpse
of
a
burned
child
it
was
gruesome
i
suffered
a
tremendous
shock
there
were
about
ten
people
there
but
the
doctor
on
duty
said
that
because
of
the
numbers
they
were
being
taken
to
baku
there
was
a
womans
corpse
there
too
she
had
been
well
there
was
part
of
a
body
there
a
hackedoff
part
of
a
womans
body
it
was
something
terrible
the
morgue
was
guarded
by
the
landing
force
the
child
that
had
been
killed
was
only
ten
or
twelve
years
old
it
was
impossible
to
tell
if
it
was
a
boy
or
a
girl
because
the
corpse
was
burned
there
was
a
man
there
too
several
men
you
couldnt
tell
anything
because
their
faces
were
disfigured
they
were
in
such
awful
condition
now
two
and
a
half
months
have
passed
every
day
i
recall
with
horror
what
happened
in
the
city
of
sumgait
every
day
my
father
and
the
death
of
my
father
and
how
we
fought
and
the
peoples
sorrow
and
especially
the
morgue
i
still
want
to
say
that
years
have
passed
since
soviet
power
was
established
and
up
to
the
very
last
minute
we
could
not
conceive
of
what
happened
in
sumgait
it
will
go
down
in
history
im
particularly
surprised
that
the
mob
wasnt
even
afraid
of
the
troops
they
even
fought
the
soldiers
many
soldiers
were
wounded
the
mob
threw
fuel
mixtures
onto
the
armored
personnel
carriers
setting
them
on
fire
they
werent
afraid
they
were
so
sure
of
their
impunity
that
they
attacked
our
troops
i
saw
the
clashes
on
february
near
the
airline
ticket
office
right
across
from
our
building
and
that
mob
was
fighting
with
the
soldiers
the
inhabitants
of
some
of
the
buildings
also
azerbaijanis
threw
rocks
at
the
soldiers
from
windows
balconies
even
cinder
blocks
and
glass
tanks
they
werent
afraid
of
them
i
say
they
were
sure
of
their
impunity
when
we
were
at
the
neighbors
and
when
they
were
robbing
homes
near
the
airline
ticket
office
i
called
the
police
at
number
and
said
that
they
were
robbing
armenian
apartments
and
burning
homes
and
they
told
me
that
they
knew
that
they
were
being
burned
during
those
days
no
one
from
the
police
department
came
to
anyones
aid
no
one
came
to
help
us
either
to
our
home
even
though
perhaps
they
could
have
come
and
saved
us
as
we
later
found
out
the
mob
was
given
free
vodka
and
drugs
near
the
bus
station
rocks
were
distributed
in
all
parts
of
town
to
be
thrown
and
used
in
fighting
so
i
think
all
of
it
was
arranged
in
advance
they
even
knew
in
which
buildings
and
apartments
the
armenians
lived
on
which
floorsthey
had
lists
the
bandits
you
can
tell
that
the
operation
was
planned
in
advance
thanks
of
course
to
our
troops
to
the
countrys
leadership
and
to
the
leadership
of
the
ministry
of
defense
for
helping
us
thanks
to
the
russian
people
because
the
majority
of
the
troops
were
russians
and
the
troops
suffered
losses
too
i
want
to
express
this
gratitude
in
the
name
of
my
family
and
in
the
name
of
all
armenians
and
in
the
name
of
all
sumgait
armenians
for
coming
in
time
and
averting
terrible
things
worse
would
have
happened
if
that
mob
had
not
been
stopped
on
time
at
present
an
investigation
is
being
conducted
on
the
part
of
the
ussr
procuracy
i
want
to
say
that
those
bandits
should
receive
the
severest
possible
punishment
because
if
they
dont
the
tragedy
the
genocide
could
happen
again
everyone
should
see
that
the
most
severe
punishment
is
meted
out
for
such
deeds
very
many
bandits
and
hardened
hooligans
took
part
in
the
unrest
in
the
mass
disturbances
the
mobs
were
huge
at
present
not
all
of
them
have
been
