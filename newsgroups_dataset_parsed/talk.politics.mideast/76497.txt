UNTIL
ELEVEN
OCLOCK
AT

WE
HEARD
THE
SOUND
OF
MOTORS
THE
NEIGHBORS
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIERS
WE
WENT
DOWNSTAIRS
THERE
WAS
A
LIGHT
ON
IN
THE
ROOM
WHERE
WE
LEFT
FATHER
IN
THE
OTHER
ROOMS
AS
WE
FOUND
OUT
LATER
ALL
THE
CHANDELIERS
HAD
BEEN
TORN
DOWN
THEY
LEFT
ONLY
ONE
BULB
THE
BULB
WAS
BURNING
WHICH
PROBABLY
WAS
A
SIGNAL
THEY
HAD
AGREED
ON
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
A
LIGHT
BURNING
IN
EVERY
APARTMENT
IN
OUR
MICRODISTRICT
WHERE
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
POGROM
WITH
THE
HELP
OF
THE
SOLDIERS
WE
MADE
IT
TO
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
AND
WERE
SAVED
OUR
SALVATIONMY
MOTHERS
MY
BROTHERS
AND
MINEWAS
PURELY
ACCIDENTAL
BECAUSE
AS
WE
LATER
FOUND
OUT
FROM
THE
NEIGHBORS
SOMEONE
IN
THE
CROWD
SHOUTED
THAT
WE
HAD
FIREARMS
UP
THERE
WELL
WE
FOUGHT
BUT
WE
WERE
ONLY
ABLE
TO
SAVE
MOTHER
WE
COULDNT
SAVE
FATHER
WE
INFLICTED
MANY
INJURIES
ON
THE
BANDITS
SOME
OF
THEM
SERIOUS
BUT
OTHERS
CAME
TO
TAKE
THEIR
PLACES
WE
WERE
ALSO
WOUNDED
THERE
WAS
BLOOD
AND
WE
WERE
SCRATCHED
ALL
OVERWE
GOT
OUR
SHARE
IT
WAS
A
MIRACLE
WE
SURVIVED
WE
WERE
SAVED
BY
A
MIRACLE
AND
THE
TROOPS
AND
IF
TROOPS
HADNT
COME
TO
SUMGAIT
THE
SLAUGHTER
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
EVEN
GREATER
PROBABLY
ALL
THE
ARMENIANS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
VICTIMS
OF
THE
GENOCIDE
THROUGH
AN
ACQUAINTANCE
AT
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
I
WAS
ABLE
TO
CONTACT
THE
LEADERSHIP
OF
THE
MILITARY
UNIT
THAT
WAS
BROUGHT
INTO
THE
CITY
AND
AT
THEIR
ORDERS
WE
WERE
ASSIGNED
SPECIAL
PEOPLE
TO
ACCOMPANY
US
EXPERTS
WE
WENT
TO
PICK
UP
FATHERS
CORPSE
WE
TOOK
IT
TO
THE
MORGUE
THIS
WAS
ABOUT
TWO
OCLOCK
IN
THE
MORNING
IT
WAS
ALREADY
MARCH
IT
WAS
RAINING
VERY
HARD
AND
IT
WAS
QUITE
COLD
AND
WE
WERE
WEARING
ONLY
OUR
SUITS
WHEN
MY
BROTHER
AND
I
CARRIED
FATHER
INTO
THE
MORGUE
WE
SAW
THE
BURNED
AND
DISFIGURED
CORPSES
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
SIX
BURNED
PEOPLE
IN
THERE
AND
THE
SMALL
CORPSE
OF
A
BURNED
CHILD
IT
WAS
GRUESOME
I
SUFFERED
A
TREMENDOUS
SHOCK
THERE
WERE
ABOUT
TEN
PEOPLE
THERE
BUT
THE
DOCTOR
ON
DUTY
SAID
THAT
BECAUSE
OF
THE
NUMBERS
THEY
WERE
BEING
TAKEN
TO
BAKU
THERE
WAS
A
WOMANS
CORPSE
THERE
TOO
SHE
HAD
BEEN
WELL
THERE
WAS
PART
OF
A
BODY
THERE
A
HACKEDOFF
PART
OF
A
WOMANS
BODY
IT
WAS
SOMETHING
TERRIBLE
THE
MORGUE
WAS
GUARDED
BY
THE
LANDING
FORCE
THE
CHILD
THAT
HAD
BEEN
KILLED
WAS
ONLY
TEN
OR
TWELVE
YEARS
OLD
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TELL
IF
IT
WAS
A
BOY
OR
A
GIRL
BECAUSE
THE
CORPSE
WAS
BURNED
THERE
WAS
A
MAN
THERE
TOO
SEVERAL
MEN
YOU
COULDNT
TELL
ANYTHING
BECAUSE
THEIR
FACES
WERE
DISFIGURED
THEY
WERE
IN
SUCH
AWFUL
CONDITION
NOW
TWO
AND
A
HALF
MONTHS
HAVE
PASSED
EVERY
DAY
I
RECALL
WITH
HORROR
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
THE
CITY
OF
SUMGAIT
EVERY
DAY
MY
FATHER
AND
THE
DEATH
OF
MY
FATHER
AND
HOW
WE
FOUGHT
AND
THE
PEOPLES
SORROW
AND
ESPECIALLY
THE
MORGUE
I
STILL
WANT
TO
SAY
THAT
YEARS
HAVE
PASSED
SINCE
SOVIET
POWER
WAS
ESTABLISHED
AND
UP
TO
THE
VERY
LAST
MINUTE
WE
COULD
NOT
CONCEIVE
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
IN
SUMGAIT
IT
WILL
GO
DOWN
IN
HISTORY
IM
PARTICULARLY
SURPRISED
THAT
THE
MOB
WASNT
EVEN
AFRAID
OF
THE
TROOPS
THEY
EVEN
FOUGHT
THE
SOLDIERS
MANY
SOLDIERS
WERE
WOUNDED
THE
MOB
THREW
FUEL
MIXTURES
ONTO
THE
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIERS
SETTING
THEM
ON
FIRE
THEY
WERENT
AFRAID
THEY
WERE
SO
SURE
OF
THEIR
IMPUNITY
THAT
THEY
ATTACKED
OUR
TROOPS
I
SAW
THE
CLASHES
ON
FEBRUARY
NEAR
THE
AIRLINE
TICKET
OFFICE
RIGHT
ACROSS
FROM
OUR
BUILDING
AND
THAT
MOB
WAS
FIGHTING
WITH
THE
SOLDIERS
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
SOME
OF
THE
BUILDINGS
ALSO
AZERBAIJANIS
THREW
ROCKS
AT
THE
SOLDIERS
FROM
WINDOWS
BALCONIES
EVEN
CINDER
BLOCKS
AND
GLASS
TANKS
THEY
WERENT
AFRAID
OF
THEM
I
SAY
THEY
WERE
SURE
OF
THEIR
IMPUNITY
WHEN
WE
WERE
AT
THE
NEIGHBORS
AND
WHEN
THEY
WERE
ROBBING
HOMES
NEAR
THE
AIRLINE
TICKET
OFFICE
I
CALLED
THE
POLICE
AT
NUMBER
AND
SAID
THAT
THEY
WERE
ROBBING
ARMENIAN
APARTMENTS
AND
BURNING
HOMES
AND
THEY
TOLD
ME
THAT
THEY
KNEW
THAT
THEY
WERE
BEING
BURNED
DURING
THOSE
DAYS
NO
ONE
FROM
THE
POLICE
DEPARTMENT
CAME
TO
ANYONES
AID
NO
ONE
CAME
TO
HELP
US
EITHER
TO
OUR
HOME
EVEN
THOUGH
PERHAPS
THEY
COULD
HAVE
COME
AND
SAVED
US
AS
WE
LATER
FOUND
OUT
THE
MOB
WAS
GIVEN
FREE
VODKA
AND
DRUGS
NEAR
THE
BUS
STATION
ROCKS
WERE
DISTRIBUTED
IN
ALL
PARTS
OF
TOWN
TO
BE
THROWN
AND
USED
IN
FIGHTING
SO
I
THINK
ALL
OF
IT
WAS
ARRANGED
IN
ADVANCE
THEY
EVEN
KNEW
IN
WHICH
BUILDINGS
AND
APARTMENTS
THE
ARMENIANS
LIVED
ON
WHICH
FLOORSTHEY
HAD
LISTS
THE
BANDITS
YOU
CAN
TELL
THAT
THE
OPERATION
WAS
PLANNED
IN
ADVANCE
THANKS
OF
COURSE
TO
OUR
TROOPS
TO
THE
COUNTRYS
LEADERSHIP
AND
TO
THE
LEADERSHIP
OF
THE
MINISTRY
OF
DEFENSE
FOR
HELPING
US
THANKS
TO
THE
RUSSIAN
PEOPLE
BECAUSE
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
TROOPS
WERE
RUSSIANS
AND
THE
TROOPS
SUFFERED
LOSSES
TOO
I
WANT
TO
EXPRESS
THIS
GRATITUDE
IN
THE
NAME
OF
MY
FAMILY
AND
IN
THE
NAME
OF
ALL
ARMENIANS
AND
IN
THE
NAME
OF
ALL
SUMGAIT
ARMENIANS
FOR
COMING
IN
TIME
AND
AVERTING
TERRIBLE
THINGS
WORSE
WOULD
HAVE
HAPPENED
IF
THAT
MOB
HAD
NOT
BEEN
STOPPED
ON
TIME
AT
PRESENT
AN
INVESTIGATION
IS
BEING
CONDUCTED
ON
THE
PART
OF
THE
USSR
PROCURACY
I
WANT
TO
SAY
THAT
THOSE
BANDITS
SHOULD
RECEIVE
THE
SEVEREST
POSSIBLE
PUNISHMENT
BECAUSE
IF
THEY
DONT
THE
TRAGEDY
THE
GENOCIDE
COULD
HAPPEN
AGAIN
EVERYONE
SHOULD
SEE
THAT
THE
MOST
SEVERE
PUNISHMENT
IS
METED
OUT
FOR
SUCH
DEEDS
VERY
MANY
BANDITS
AND
HARDENED
HOOLIGANS
TOOK
PART
IN
THE
UNREST
IN
THE
MASS
DISTURBANCES
THE
MOBS
WERE
HUGE
AT
PRESENT
NOT
ALL
OF
THEM
HAVE
BEEN
CAUGHT
VERY
FEW
OF
THEM
HAVE
BEEN
I
THINK
JUDGING
BY
THE
NEWSPAPER
REPORTS
THERE
WERE
AROUND
PEOPLE
NEAR
OUR
BUILDING
ALONE
THATS
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
TOOK
PART
IN
THE
POGROM
OF
OUR
BUILDING
ALL
IN
ALL
THEY
SHOULD
ALL
RECEIVE
THE
MOST
SEVERE
PUNISHMENT
SO
THAT
OTHERS
SEE
THAT
RETRIBUTION
AWAITS
THOSE
WHO
PERFORM
SUCH
ACTS
MAY
YEREVAN
