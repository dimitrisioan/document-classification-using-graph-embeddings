ARTICLE
WRITES
LOOK
MR
ATAKAN
I
HAVE
REPEATED
IT
IN
THE
PAST
AND
I
SHALL
REPEAT
IT
ONCE
MORE
THAT
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
HOW
GREEKS
ARE
TREATING
THE
TURKS
IN
GREECE
YOU
AND
YOUR
COPATRIOTS
SHOULD
SIMPLY
SHUT
UP
BECAUSE
WHAT
YOU
ARE
HEARING
IS
SIMPLY
A
FORM
OF
PROPAGANDA
FROM
YOUR
ETHNIC
FELLOWS
WHO
STUDIED
AT
THE
GREEK
UNIVERSITIES
WITHOUT
PAYING
ANY
MONEY
FOR
TUITION
FOOD
AND
HELTH
INSURANCE
AND
ANY
HIGH
SCHOOL
GRADUATE
CAN
PUT
DOWN
SOME
SIMPLE
MATH
AND
COMPARE
THE
GROUTH
OF
THE
TURKISH
COMMUNITY
IN
GREECE
WITH
THE
DESTRUCTION
OF
THE
GREEK
MINORITY
IN
TURKEY

MR
TAMAMIDIS
BEFORE
REPLING
YOUR
CLAIMS
I
SUGGEST
YOU
BE
KIND
TO
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
ARE
TRYING
TO
MAKE
SOME
POINTS
ABOUTS
HUMAN
RIGHTS
DISCRIMINATIONS
AND
UNEQUAL
TREATMENT
OF
TURKISH
MINORITY
IN
GREECEI
WANT
THE
WORLD
KNOW
HOW
BAD
YOU
TREAT
THESE
PEOPLE
YOU
WILL
DENY
ANYTHING
I
SAY
BUT
IT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
ANY
DIFRENCE
BECAUSE
I
WILL
WRITE
THINGS
THAT
I
SAW
WITH
MY
EYESYOU
PROVE
YOURSELF
PREJUDICE
BY
SAYING
FREE
INSURANCE
SCHOOL
ETC
DO
YOU
GREEKS
ONLY
GIVE
THESE
THINGS
TO
TURKISH
MINORITY
OR
EVERYBODY
HAS
RIGHTS
TO
GET
THEMYOUR
WORDS
EVEN
DISCRIMINATE
THESE
PEOPLE
YOU
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
GIVING
BIG
FAVOR
TO
THESE
PEOPLE
BY
GIVING
THESE
THING
THAT
IN
REALITY
THEY
GET
NOTHING
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
KNOW
UNHUMAN
PRACTICES
THAT
ARE
BEING
CONDUCTED
BY
THE
GOVERNMENT
OF
THE
GREECE
I
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
INVESTIGATE
TO
SEE
THE
FACTS
THEN
WE
CAN
DISCUSS
ABOUT
THE
MOST
BASIC
HUMAN
RIGHTS
LIKE
FREDOM
OF
RELIGION
IF
YOU
DID
NOT
SEE
WITH
YOUR
EYES
FREEDOM
OF
RELIGION
YOU
MUST
NE
AT
LEAST
BLIND
FREDOM
OF
PRESS
OF
TURKISH
WEEKS
AGO
I
READ
THE
INTERVIEW
OF
A
TURKISH
JOURNALIST
IN
A
GREEK
MAGAZINE
HE
SAID
NOTHING
ABOUT
BEING
FORBIDEN
TO
HAVE
TURKISH
PRESS
IN
GREECE
MINORITY
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
OF
ALL
TURKS
IN
GREECE
GIVE
AS
A
BRAKE
YOU
CALL
ATHNIC
CLEANSING
OF
APOPULATION
WHEN
IT
DOUBLES
FREEDOM
OF
RIGHT
TO
HAVE
PROPERTY
WITHOUT
GOVERNMENT
INTERVENTION
WHAT
DO
YOU
MEAN
BY
THAT
ANYWAY
IN
GREECE
AS
IN
EVERY
COUNTRY
IF
YOU
WANT
SOME
PROPERTY
YOU
INFORM
THE
GOVERMENT
FREDOM
OF
RIGHT
TO
VOTE
TO
CHOOSE
YOUR
COMMUNITY
LEADERS
WELL
WELL
WELL
WHEN
TURKISH
IN
AREA
OF
KOMOTINI
ELECT
OUT
OF
REPRESENATIVES
OF
THIS
AREA
TO
GREEK
PARLIAMENT
IF
NOT
FREEDOM
WHAT
IS
IT
OUT
OF
MAYBE
THERE
ARE
ONLY
TURKS
LIVING
THERE
HOW
GREEK
GOVERNMENT
ENCOURAGES
PEOPLE
TO
DESTROY
RELIGIOUS
PLACES
HOUSES
FARMS
SCHOOLS
FOR
TURKISH
MINORITY
THEN
FORCING
THEM
TO
GO
TO
TURKEY
WITHOUT
ANYTHING
WITH
THEM
I
CANNOT
DENY
THAT
ACTIONS
OF
FANATICS
FROM
BOTH
SIDES
WERE
REPORTED
A
MINORITY
OF
GREEK
IDIOTS
INDEED
ATTACK
RELIGIOUS
PLACES
WHICH
WERE
PROTECTED
BY
THE
GREEK
POLICE
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
GREEK
POLICEMEN
PREVENTING
TURKS
FROM
THIS
NON
BRAIN
MINORITY
WERE
ALL
OVER
GREEK
PRESS
BEFORE
I
CONCLUDE
MY
WRITING
LET
ME
POINT
OUT
HOW
GREEKS
ARE
TREATED
IN
TURKEY
WE
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THEM
GREEK
MINORITY
INSTEAD
WE
CONSIDER
A
PART
OF
OUR
SOCIETY
THERE
IS
NO
DIFFERENCE
AMONG
PEOPLE
IN
TURKEY
WE
DO
NOT
STATE
THAT
GREEK
MINORITY
GO
TO
TURKISH
UNIVERSITIES
GET
FREE
INSURANCE
FOOD
AND
HEALTH
INSURANCE
BECAUSE
THESE
ARE
BASIC
HUMAN
NEEDS
AND
THEY
ARE
A
PART
OF
TURKISH
COMMUNITY
ALL
BIG
BUSINESSES
BELONG
TO
GREEKS
IN
TURKEY
AND
WE
ARE
PROUD
TO
HAVE
THEMUNLIKE
THE
GREECE
WHICH
TRIES
TO
DESTROY
TURKISH
MINORITY
WE
ENCOURAGE
ALL
MINORITIES
IN
TURKEY
TO
BE
A
PART
OF
TURKISH
SOCIETY
OH
NO
PLEASE
DO
GIVE
AS
A
BRAKE
MINORITIES
IN
TURKISH
TREATED
LIKE
THAT
YOUR
OWN
COUNTRYMEN
DIE
IN
THE
PRISONS
EVERY
DAY
BACAUSE
OF
THEIR
POLITICAL
BELIEFS
AN
THIS
IS
REPORTED
BY
TURKS
AND
YOU
WANT
US
TO
BELIEVE
THA
TURKEY
IS
THE
PARADISE
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
BUSINESS
OF
GREEKS
I
TURKEY
YES
YEARS
AGO
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
INTELLIGENT
SO
BEFORE
PRESENTING
TURKEY
AS
THE
PARADISE
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
JUST
INVASTIGATE
THIS
MATTER
