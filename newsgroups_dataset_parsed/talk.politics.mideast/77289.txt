THIS
IS
NOT
A
FRESH
CASE
OF
ETHNIC
CLEANSING
BUT
JUST
ANOTHER
CHAPTER
IN
THE
CONTINUING
SAGA
OF
INTENSE
MUTUAL
HATRED
DESTRUCTION
EVERY
PLACE
ON
EARTH
IS
THE
SCENE
OF
A
SAGA
OF
MUTUAL
HATRED
AND
DESTRUCTION
THE
HOLOCAUST
WAS
NOT
A
FRESH
CASE
IT
WAS
ANOTHER
CHAPTER
IN
A
YEAR
HISTORY
OF
ATTACKS
ON
JEWS
IN
EUROPE
THAT
DIDNT
MAKE
IT
ACCEPTABLE
AND
BALKAN
HISTORY
DOES
NOT
MAKE
THE
GENOCIDE
AGAINST
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
ACCEPTABLE
I
GUESS
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
ACCEPTABLE
BECAUSE
GERMANY
ALSO
CHOSE
A
PATH
OF
AGGRESSION
SIMULTANEOUSLY
THAT
PUT
THE
INTERESTS
OF
OTHER
COUNTRIES
IN
PERIL
I
WONDER
WHETHER
US
OR
OTHER
COUNTRIES
WOULD
HAVE
RISKED
THEMSELVES
IF
ONLY
JEWS
WERE
PERSECUTED
AND
HITLER
HAD
NO
IMPERIALIST
AMBITIONS
I
AM
NO
STUDENT
OF
HISTORY
AND
I
AM
JUST
ASKING
QUESTIONS
ACTUALLY
THE
RECORD
OF
THE
ALLIES
ACTIVITIES
IN
THE
FACE
OF
INCONTROVERTIBLE
EVIDENCE
AS
TO
WHAT
THE
NAZIS
MAY
THEY
ROT
IN
HELL
WERE
DOING
CLEARLY
POINTS
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
NOTHING
THE
RAILWAYS
TO
THE
CAMPS
WERE
NOT
BOMBED
DESPITE
THE
EASE
OF
DOING
SO
THE
US
THE
PLACE
OF
REFUGE
ALLOWED
IN
A
BARE
PITTANCE
OF
JEWS
FROM
EUROPE
PRIMARILY
FOR
PUBLIC
RELATIONS
SO
THAT
THE
GOVERNMENT
COULD
SAY
IT
WAS
DOING
SOMETHING
MANY
SHIPS
WITH
REFUGEES
WERE
TURNED
AWAY
FROM
US
SHORES
SOME
FOUND
REFUGE
IN
CUBA
OR
SOUTH
AMERICA
MANY
OTHERS
SUNK
OR
HAD
TO
RETURN
TO
EUROPE
WITH
PREDICTABLE
CONSEQUENCES
THE
HOPE
TODAY
IS
THAT
WE
HAVE
COLLECTIVELY
LEARNED
A
LESSON
AND
ARE
LESS
COMPLACENT
TO
IGNORE
OTHER
COUNTRIES
INTERNAL
AFFAIRS
THE
SAD
REALITY
IS
THAT
THIS
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
BE
THE
CASE
