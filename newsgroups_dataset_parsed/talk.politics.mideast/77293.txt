please
dont
be
offended
at
this
question
who
are
the
muslims
in
the
bosnian
context
i
know
that
a
moslemmuslim
is
a
believer
in
islam
islam
is
a
religion
and
it
is
practised
in
many
parts
of
the
world
but
it
is
not
yes
definitely
not
an
ethinic
group
ok
so
these
bosnian
muslims
who
are
they
to
which
ethnic
group
do
they
belong
what
languages
do
they
speak
do
they
have
a
different
language
from
that
of
the
serbs
or
croats
the
way
the
western
press
use
the
word
muslim
in
this
bosnian
debacle
has
kept
me
wondering
when
the
meaning
of
muslimmoslem
i
knew
from
childhood
was
changed
in
the
dictionary
this
is
just
a
question
no
flames
intended
oguocha
youve
asked
a
crucial
question
that
underlies
much
of
the
genocide
bosnian
muslims
are
slavic
in
ethnicity
they
speak
serbocroatian
but
there
is
a
christoslavic
ideology
whereby
all
true
slavs
are
christian
and
anyone
who
converted
to
islam
thereby
must
have
changed
ethnicity
by
changing
religion
see
the
poems
of
ngegos
or
the
novels
of
ivo
andric
who
brilliantly
displays
these
attitudes
on
the
part
of
what
he
calls
the
people
ie
christian
slavs
for
this
reason
the
warcriminals
call
all
the
bosnian
muslims
turks
even
though
they
are
not
ethnically
turk
and
do
not
speak
turkish
as
their
first
language
for
this
reason
what
is
actually
a
genocide
labeled
against
those
who
are
ethnically
identical
but
religiously
other
is
called
paradoxically
ethnic
cleansing
rather
than
religious
cleansing
thus
while
a
war
rages
between
serbs
and
croats
as
a
continuation
of
wwii
and
older
agenda
the
annihilation
of
islam
and
muslims
from
bosnian
is
being
carried
out
under
the
cover
of
the
serbocroat
war
