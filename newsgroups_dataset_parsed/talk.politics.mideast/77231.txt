you
appear
to
be
referring
to
moshe
dayan
how
do
you
know
that
the
evicted
jordanians
were
not
provided
with
something
else
in
fact
this
thread
indicates
that
they
were
squatters
on
land
that
they
did
not
own
but
received
compensation
for
their
loss
anyways
woe
to
jews
when
they
feel
that
recovering
land
that
has
been
taken
from
them
by
force
with
ethnic
cleansing
of
any
remaining
jews
is
disgusting
and
shameful
does
anyone
have
a
reference
to
the
claim
that
the
arabs
in
the
moghrabi
district
were
squatters
i
havent
seen
this
in
the
books
i
have
read
i
havent
seen
the
opposite
either
