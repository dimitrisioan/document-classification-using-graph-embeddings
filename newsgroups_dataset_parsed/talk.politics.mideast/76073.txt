A
MOMENT
OF
SILENCE
APRIL
IS
APPROACHING
AND
ARMENIANS
AROUND
THE
WORLD
ARE
GETTING
READY
TO
REMEMBER
THE
MASSACRES
OF
THEIR
FAMILY
MEMBERS
BY
THE
TURKISH
GOVERNMENT
BETWEEN
AND
AT
LEAST
MILLION
ARMENIANS
PERISHED
DURING
THAT
PERIOD
AND
IT
IS
IMPORTANT
TO
NOTE
THAT
THOSE
WHO
DENY
THAT
THIS
EVENT
EVER
TOOK
PLACE
EITHER
SUPPORTED
THE
POLICY
OF
TO
EXTERMINATE
THE
ARMENIANS
OR
AS

PAINFULLY
WITNESSED
IN
AZERBAIJAN
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SEE
IT
HAPPEN
AGAIN
