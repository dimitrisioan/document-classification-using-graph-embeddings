MOST
OF

DIDNT
GET
ALONG
WITH
YOU
BUT
IM

REMEMBERED
SOMETHING

WHEN

WENT
OUT
ONTO
THE

FOURTH
FLOOR
OF
THE
NEIGHBORING
BUILDING
BUT
I
DIDNT
THINK

I
THOUGHT
THAT

ON
FIRE
OR
THEY
WERE
THROWING
SOMETHING
THEY
DIDNT
NEED
OUT
OR
SOMEONE
WAS
FIGHTING
WITH
SOMEONE

SO
MUCH
THOSE
CREEPS

PROBABLY
BROKEN
MY
RIBS
PLEASE
LOOK
AT
THEM
THE
DOCTOR
SAYS
THATS
NOT
MY
JOB
URSHAN

FINE

MY
PLACE
AND
IF
WE
NEED
A
DOCTOR
ILL
FIND
YOU
ONE
ILL
BRING
ONE
AND
HAVE
HIM
LOOK
AT
YOU
AND
HE
DROVE
THEM
TO
HIS
APARTMENT
MARINA
AND
I
STAYED
THERE
THEY
EXAMINED
US
I
WAS
MORE
STRUCK
BY
WHAT
THE
DOCTOR
SAID
THAN
BY
WHAT
THOSE
AZERBAIJANIS
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
DID
TO
US
I
WASNT
SURPRISED
WHEN
THEY
BEAT
US
THEY
WANTED
TO
BEAT
US
BUT
I
WAS
VERY
SURPRISED
THAT
IN
A
SOVIET
MEDICAL
FACILITY
A
WOMAN
WHO
HAD
TAKEN
THE
HIPPOCRATIC
OATH
COULD
TALK
TO
VICTIMS
LIKE
THAT
BY
HAPPYOR
UNHAPPY
COINCIDENCE
WE
WERE
SEEN
BY
THE
DOCTOR
THAT
HAD
DELIVERED
OUR
KARINA
AND
SHE
HAVING
EXAMINED
KARINA
SAID
NO
PROBLEM
YOU
GOT
OFF
PRETTY
GOOD
NOT
LIKE
THEY
DID
IN
KAFAN
WHEN
YOU
ARMENIANS
WERE
KILLING
AND
RAPING
OUR
WOMEN
KARINA
WAS
IN
SUCH
TERRIBLE
CONDITION
THAT
SHE
COULDNT
SAY
ANYTHINGSHE
WOULD
CERTAINLY
HAVE
HAD
SOMETHING
TO
SAY
THEN
THEY
EXAMINED
ME
THE
SAME
STORY
THEY
PUT
US
IN
A
SEPARATE
WARD
NO
SHOTS
NO
MEDICINAL
POWDERS
NO
DRUGS
ABSOLUTELY
NONE
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
GIVE
US
TEA
ALL
THE
WOMEN
THERE
SOON
FOUND
OUT
THAT
IN
WARD
SUCH
AND
SUCH
WERE
ARMENIANS
WHO
HAD
BEEN
RAPED
AND
THEY
STARTED
COMING
AND
PEERING
THROUGH
THE
KEYHOLE
THE
WAY
PEOPLE
LOOK
AT
ZOO
ANIMALS
KARINA
DIDNT
SEE
THIS
SHE
WAS
LYING
THERE
AND
I
KEPT
HER
FROM
SEEING
IT
THEY
PUT
IRA
B
IN
OUR
WARD
SHE
HAD
ALSO
BEEN
RAPED
TRUE
SHE
DIDNT
HAVE
ANY
SERIOUS
BODILY
INJURIES
BUT
WHEN
SHE
TOLD
ME
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
AT
THEIR
PLACE
I
FELT
WORSE
FOR
THEM
THAN
I
DID
FOR
US
BECAUSE
WHEN
THEY
RAPED
IRA
HER
DAUGHTER
WAS
IN
THE
ROOM
SHE
WAS
UNDER
THE
BED
ON
WHICH
IT
HAPPENED
AND
IRA
WAS
HOLDING
HER
DAUGHTERS
HAND
THE
ONE
WHO
WAS
HIDING
UNDER
THE
BED
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BEATING
IRA
OR
TAKING
HER
EARRINGS
OFF
GOLD
WHEN
SHE
INVOLUNTARILY
LET
GO
OF
HER
DAUGHTERS
HAND
HER
DAUGHTER
TOOK
HER
HAND
AGAIN
HER
DAUGHTER
IS
IN
THE
FOURTH
GRADE
SHES
YEARS
OLD
I
FELT
REALLY
AWFUL
WHEN
I
HEARD
THAT
IRA
ASKED
THEM
NOT
TO
HARM
HER
DAUGHTER
SHE
SAID
DO
WHAT
YOU
WANT
WITH
ME
JUST
LEAVE
MY
DAUGHTER
ALONE
WELL
THEY
DID
WHAT
THEY
WANTED
THEY
THREATENED
TO
KILL
HER
DAUGHTER
IF
SHE
GOT
IN
THEIR
WAY
NOW
I
WOULD
BE
SURPRISED
IF
THE
CRIMINALS
HAD
BEHAVED
ANY
OTHER
WAY
THAT
NIGHT
IT
WAS
SIMPLY
BARTHOLOMEWS
NIGHT
I
SAY
THEY
DID
WHAT
THEY
WOULD
LOVE
TO
DO
EVERY
DAY
STEAL
KILL
RAPE
MANY
ARE
SURPRISED
THAT
THOSE
ANIMALS
DIDNT
HARM
THE
CHILDREN
THE
BEASTS
EXPLAINED
IT
LIKE
THIS
THIS
WOULD
BE
REPEATED
IN
TO
YEARS
AND
THOSE
CHILDREN
WOULD
BE
GROWN
AND
THEN
AS
THEY
PUT
IT
WELL
COME
TAKE
THE
PLEASURE
OUT
OF
THEIR
LIVES
THOSE
CHILDREN
THIS
WAS
ABOUT
THE
GIRLS
THAT
WOULD
BE
YOUNG
WOMEN
IN
YEARS
THEY
WERE
THINKING
ABOUT
THEIR
TOMORROW
BECAUSE
THEY
WERE
SURE
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
NO
TRIAL
AND
NO
INVESTIGATION
JUST
AS
THERE
WAS
NO
TRIAL
OR
INVESTIGATION
IN
AND
THAT
THOSE
GIRLS
COULD
BE
OF
SOME
USE
IN
YEARS
THIS
I
HEARD
FROM
THE
INVESTIGATORS
ONE
OF
THE
VICTIMS
TESTIFIED
TO
IT
THATS
HOW
THEY
DESCRIBED
THEIR
OWN
NATURES
THAT
THEY
WOULD
STILL
BE
BLOODTHIRSTY
IN
TO
YEARS
AND
IN
YEARSTHEY
THEMSELVES
SAID
THAT
AND
THIS
TOO
EVERYONE
IS
SURPRISED
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
HARM
OUR
MARINA
MANY
PEOPLE
SAY
THAT
THEY
EITHER
WERE
DRUNK
OR
HAD
SMOKED
TOO
MUCH
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
THEIR
EYES
WERE
RED
MAYBE
BECAUSE
THEY
HADNT
SLEPT
THE
NIGHT
BEFORE
MAYBE
FOR
SOME
OTHER
REASON
I
DONT
KNOW
BUT
THEY
HADNT
BEEN
SMOKING
AND
THEY
WERENT
DRUNK
IM
POSITIVE
BECAUSE
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
SMOKED
WILL
STOP
AT
NOTHING
HE
HAS
THE
URGE
TO
DO
AND
THEY
SPOKE
IN
A
CULTURED
FASHION
WITH
MARINA
LITTLE
SISTER
DONT
BE
AFRAID
WE
WONT
HARM
YOU
DONT
LOOK
OVER
THERE
WHERE
I
WAS
YOU
MIGHT
BE
FRIGHTENED
YOURE
A
MUSLIM
A
MUSLIM
WOMAN
SHOULDNT
SEE
SUCH
THINGS
SO
THEY
WERE
REALLY
QUITE
SOBER
SO
WE
CAME
OUT
OF
THAT
STORY
ALIVE
EACH
EVERY
DAY
WE
HAVE
LIVED
SINCE
IT
ALL
HAPPENED
BEARS
THE
MARK
OF
THAT
DAY
IT
WASNT
EVEN
A
DAY
OF
THOSE
SEVERAL
HOURS
FATHER
STILL
CANT
LOOK
US
IN
THE
EYES
HE
STILL
FEELS
GUILTY
FOR
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
KARINA
MOTHER
AND
ME
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
NERVES
HES
STARTED
TALK
ING
TO
HIMSELF
IVE
HEARD
HIM
ARGUE
WITH
HIMSELF
SEVERAL
TIMES
WHEN
HE
THOUGHT
NO
ONE
IS
LISTENING
LISTEN
HELL
SAY
WHAT
COULD
I
DO
WHAT
COULD
I
DO
ALONE
HOW
COULD
I
PROTECT
THEM
I
DONT
KNOW
WHERE
TO
FIND
THE
WORDS
ITS
NOT
THAT
IM
HAPPY
BUT
I
AM
GLAD
THAT
HE
DIDNT
SEE
IT
ALL
HAPPEN
THATS
THE
ONLY
THING
THEY
SPARED
US
OR
MAYBE
IT
HAPPENED
BY
CHANCE
OF
COURSE
HE
KNOWS
IT
ALL
BUT
THERES
NO
WAY
YOU
COULD
IMAGINE
EVERY
LAST
DETAIL
OF
WHAT
HAPPENED
AND
THERE
WERE
SO
MANY
CONVERSATIONS
KARINA
AND
I
SPOKE
TOGETHER
IN
PRIVATE
AND
WE
TALKED
WITH
MAMMA
TOO
BUT
FATHER
WAS
NEVER
PRESENT
AT
THOSE
CONVERSATIONS
WE
SPARE
HIM
THAT
IF
YOU
CAN
SAY
THAT
AND
WHEN
THE
INVESTIGATOR
COMES
TO
THE
HOUSE
WE
DONT
SPEAK
WITH
FATHER
PRESENT
ON
FEBRUARY
THE
NEXT
CLAY
KARINA
AND
I
WERE
DISCHARGED
FROM
THE
HOSPITAL
FIRST
THEY
RELEASED
ME
BUT
SINCE
MARTIAL
LAW
HAD
BEEN
DECLARED
IN
THE
CITY
THE
SOLDIERS
TOOK
ME
TO
THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
IN
AN
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIER
THERE
WERE
MANY
PEOPLE
THERE
ARMENIAN
VICTIMS
I
MET
THE
TOVMASIAN
FAMILY
THERE
FROM
THEM
I
LEARNED
THAT
RAFIK
AND
THEIR
UNCLE
GRANT
HAD
DIED
THEY
WERE
SURE
THAT
BOTH
HAD
DIED
THEY
WERE
TALKING
TO
ME
AND
RAYA
RAFIKS
WIFE
AND
GRANTS
DAUGHTER
AND
HER
MOTHER
WERE
BOTH
CRYING
THEN
THEY
TOOK
US
ALL
OUT
OF
THE
OFFICE
ON
THE
FIRST
FLOOR
INTO
THE
YARD
THERES
A
LITTLE
ONEROOM
HOUSE
OUTSIDE
THERE
A
RECREATION
AND
READING
AREA
THEY
TOOK
US
IN
THERE
THE
WOMEN
WERE
AFRAID
TO
GO
BECAUSE
THEY
THOUGHT
THAT
THEY
WERE
SHOOING
US
OUT
OF
THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
BECOME
SO
DANGEROUS
THAT
EVEN
THE
PEOPLE
WORKING
AT
THE
PRECINCT
WANTED
TO
HIDE
THE
WOMEN
WERE
SHOUTING
THEY
EXPLAINED
TO
THEM
WE
WANT
TO
HIDE
YOU
BETTER
BECAUSE
ITS
POSSIBLE
THERE
WILL
BE
AN
ATTACK
ON
THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
WE
WENT
INTO
THE
LITTLE
HOUSE
THERE
WERE
NO
CHAIRS
OR
TABLES
IN
THERE
WE
HAD
CHILDREN
WITH
US
AND
THEY
WERE
HUNGRY
WE
EVEN
HAD
INFANTS
WHO
NEEDED
TO
HAVE
THEIR
DIAPERS
CHANGED
NO
ONE
HAD
ANYTHING
WITH
THEM
IT
WAS
JUST
AWFUL
THEY
KEPT
US
THERE
FOR
HOURS
FROM
THE
WINDOW
OF
THE
ONE
ROOM
HOUSE
YOU
COULD
SEE
THAT
THERE
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
STANDING
ON
THE
FENCES
AROUND
THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
AS
THOUGH
THEY
WERE
SPYING
ON
US
THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
IS
SURROUNDED
BY
A
WALL
LIKE
A
FENCE
AND
ITS
ELECTRIFIED
BUT
IF
THEY
WERE
STANDING
ON
THE
WALL
IT
MEANS
THE
ELECTRICITY
WAS
SHUT
OFF
THIS
BROUGHT
GREAT
PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURE
TO
BEAR
ON
US
PARTICULARLY
ON
THOSE
WHO
HADNT
JUST
WALKED
OUT
OF
THEIR
APARTMENTS
BUT
WHO
HADNT
SLEPT
FOR
HOURS
OR
OR
THOSE
WHO
HAD
SUFFERED
PHYSICALLY
AND
SPIRITUALLY
THE
ONES
WHO
HAD
LOST
FAMILY
MEMBERS
FOR
US
IT
WAS
ANOTHER
ORDEAL
WE
WERE
ESPECIALLY
FRIGHTENED
WHEN
ALL
THE
PRECINCT
EMPLOYEES
SUDDENLY
DISAPPEARED
WE
COULDNT
SEE
A
SINGLE
PERSON
NOT
IN
THE
COURTYARD
AND
NOT
IN
THE
WINDOWS
WE
THOUGHT
THAT
THEY
MUST
HAVE
ALREADY
BEEN
HIDING
UNDER
THE
BUILDING
THAT
THEY
MUST
HAVE
SOME
SECRET
ROOM
DOWN
THERE
PEOPLE
WERE
PANICKING
THEY
STARTED
THROWING
THEMSELVES
AT
ONE
ANOTHER
THATS
THE
WAY
IT
IS
ON
A
SINKING
SHIP
WE
HEARD
THOSE
PEOPLE
MAINLY
YOUNG
PEOPLE
WHISTLING
AND
WHOPPING
ON
THE
WALLS
WE
FELT
THAT
THE
END
WAS
APPROACHING
I
WAS
COMPLETELY
TERRIFIED
I
HAD
LEFT
KARINA
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
AND
DIDNT
KNOW
WHERE
MY
PARENTS
WERE
I
WAS
SORT
OF
CALM
ABOUT
MY
PARENTS
I
WAS
THINKING
ONLY
ABOUT
KARINA
IF
HEAVEN
FORBID
THEY
SHOULD
ATTACK
THE
HOSPITAL
THEY
WOULD
IMMEDIATELY
TELL
THEM
THAT
THERE
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
IN
THERE
AND
SOMETHING
TERRIBLE
WOULD
HAPPEN
TO
KARINA
AGAIN
AND
SHE
WOULDNT
BE
ABLE
TO
TAKE
IT
THEN
SOLDIERS
WITH
DOGS
APPEARED
WHEN
THEY
SAW
THE
DOGS
SOME
OF
THE
PEOPLE
CLIMBED
DOWN
OFF
THE
FENCE
THEN
THEY
BROUGHT
IN
ABOUT
ANOTHER
SOLDIERS
THEY
ALL
HAD
MACHINE
GUNS
IN
READINESS
THEIR
FINGERS
ON
THE
TRIGGERS
WE
CALMED
DOWN
A
LITTLE
THEY
BROUGHT
US
CHAIRS
AND
BROUGHT
THE
CHILDREN
SOME
LITTLE
COTS
AND
SHOWED
US
WHERE
WE
COULD
WASH
OUR
HANDS
AND
TOOK
THE
CHILDREN
TO
THE
TOILET
BUT
WE
ALL
SAT
THERE
HUNGRY
BUT
TO
BE
HONEST
IT
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
OCCURRED
TO
ANY
OF
US
THAT
WE
HADNT
EATEN
FOR
TWO
DAYS
AND
THAT
PEOPLE
DO
EAT
THEN
CLOSER
TO
NIGHTFALL
THEY
BROUGHT
A
GROUP
OF
DETAINED
CRIMINALS
THEY
WERE
BEING
WATCHED
BY
SOLDIERS
WITH
GUARD
DOGS
ONE
OF
THE
MEN
CAME
BACK
FROM
THE
COURTYARD
AND
TOLD
US
ABOUT
IT
RAYA
TOVMASIAN
IT
WAS
LIKE
A
DIFFERENT
WOMAN
HAD
BEEN
SUBSTITUTED
EARLIER
SHE
HAD
BEEN
CRYING
WAILING
AND
CALLING
OUT
OH
RAFIK
BUT
WHEN
SHE
HEARD
ABOUT
THIS
SUCH
A
RAGE
CAME
OVER
HER
SHE
JUMPED
UP
SHE
HAD
A
COAT
ON
AND
SHE
STARTED
TO
ROLL
UP
HER
SLEEVES
LIKE
SHE
WAS
GETTING
READY
TO
BEAT
SOMEONE
AND
SUDDENLY
THERE
WERE
SOLDIERS
AND
DOGS
AND
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
SHE
RAN
OVER
TO
THEM
THE
BANDITS
WERE
STANDING
THERE
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
ABOVE
THEIR
HEADS
FACING
THE
WALL
SHE
WENT
UP
TO
ONE
OF
THEM
AND
GRABBED
HIM
BY
THE
COLLAR
AND
STARTED
TO
SHAKE
AND
THRASH
HIM
THEN
ON
TO
A
SECOND
AND
A
THIRD
EVERYONE
WAS
ROOTED
TO
THE
SPOT
NOT
ONE
OF
THE
SOLDIERS
MOVED
NO
ONE
WENT
UP
TO
HELP
OR
MADE
HER
STOP
HER
FROM
DOING
IT
AND
THE
BANDITS
FELL
DOWN
AND
COVERED
THEIR
HEADS
WITH
THEIR
HANDS
MUTTERING
SOMETHING
SHE
CAME
BACK
AND
SAT
DOWN
AND
SOMETHING
AKIN
TO
A
SMILE
APPEARED
ON
HER
FACE
SHE
BECAME
SO
QUIET
NO
TEARS
NO
CRIES
THEN
THAT
ROUND
WAS
OVER
AND
SHE
WENT
BACK
TO
BEAT

WAS
WALKING
AND
CURSING
TERRIBLY
TAKE
THAT
AND
THAT
THEY
KILLED
MY
HUSBAND

WHOLE
NIGHT
THROUGH

HE
WENT
UP
TO
THE
SECOND
FLOOR
AND
DIDNT
DEIGN
TO
SPEAK
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
APPARENTLY
HE
HAD
MORE
IMPORTANT
THINGS
TO
DO
SEVERAL
HOURS
PASSED
GUKASIAN
CALLED
ME
AND
SAYS
LYUDOCHKA
FIND
ANOTHER
TWO
OR
THREE
WERE
GOING
TO
MAKE
UP
LISTS
THEY
ASKED
FOR
THEM
UPSTAIRS
LISTS
OF
THE
DEAD
THOSE
WHOSE
WHEREABOUTS
ARE
UNKNOWN
AND
LISTS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
POGROMS
OF
THEIR
APARTMENTS
AND
OF
THOSE
WHOSE
CARS
WERE
BURNED
I
HAD
ABOUT
PEOPLE
IN
MY
LIST
WHEN
THEY
CALLED
ME
AND
SAID
LYUDA
YOUR
MAMMA
HAS
ARRIVED
SHES
LOOKING
FOR
YOU
SHE
DOESNT
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
ARE
ALIVE
AND
WELL
AND
THAT
YOURE
HERE
I
GAVE
THE
LISTS
TO
SOMEONE
AND
ASKED
THEM
TO
CONTINUE
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING
AND
WENT
OFF
THE
LIST
WAS
IMPRECISE
OF
COURSE
IT
INCLUDED
GRANT
ADAMIAN
RAYA
TOVMASIANS
FATHER
WHO
WAS
ALIVE
BUT
AT
THE
TIME
THEY
THOUGHT
HIM
DEAD
THERE
WAS
ENGELS
GRIGORIANS
FATHER
AND
AUNT
CHERKEZ
AND
MARIA
THE
LIST
ALSO
INCLUDED
THE
NAME
OF
MY
GIRLFRIEND
AND
NEIGHBOR
ZHANNA
AGABEKIAN
ONE
OF
THE
GUYS
SAID
THAT
HE
HAD
BEEN
TOLD
THAT
THEY
CHOPPED
HER
HEAD
OFF
IN
THE
COURTYARD
IN
FRONT
OF
THE
KOSMOS
MOVIE
THEATER
WE
PUT
HER
ON
THE
LIST
TOO
AND
CRIED
BUT
LATER
IT
TURNED
OUT
THAT
THAT
WAS
JUST
A
RUMOR
THAT
IN
FACT
AN
HOUR
EARLIER
SHE
HAD
SOMEHOW
LEFT
SUMGAIT
FOR
THE
MARINA
AND
FROM
THERE
HAD
SET
SAIL
FOR
KRASNOVODSK
WHERE
THANK
GOD
SHE
WAS
ALIVE
AND
WELL
I
SHOULD
ALSO
SAY
THAT
IN
ADDITION
TO
THOSE
WHO
DIED
THAT
LIST
CONTAINED
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
RUMORED
MISSING
OR
WHO
WERE
SO
BADLY
WOUNDED
THAT
THEY
WERE
GIVEN
UP
FOR
DEAD
ALL
THE
LISTS
WERE
TAKEN
TO
BAGIROV
I
DONT
REMEMBER
HOW
MANY
DEAD
WERE
CONTAINED
IN
THE
LIST
BUT
ITS
A
FACT
THAT
WHEN
GUKASIAN
CAME
IN
A
COUPLE
OF
MINUTES
LATER
HE
WAS
CURSING
AND
WAS
TERRIBLY
IRATE
I
ASKED
WHATS
GOING
ON
HE
SAID
LYUDA
CAN
YOU
IMAGINE
WHAT
ANIMALS
WHAT
SCOUNDRELS
THEY
ARE
THEY
SAY
THAT
THEY
LOST
THE
LIST
OF
THE
DEAD
PIOTR
DEMICHEV
MEMBER
OF
THE
POLITBURO
OF
THE
CENTRAL
COMMITTEE
OF
THE
COMMUNIST
PARTY
OF
THE
USSR
HAS
JUST
ARRIVED
AND
WE
WERE
SUPPOSED
TO
SUBMIT
THE
LIST
TO
HIM
SO
THAT
HED
SEE
THE
SCOPE
OF
THE
SLAUGHTER
OF
THE
TRAGEDY
WHETHER
IT
WAS
ONE
OR
FIFTY
THEY
TOLD
HIM
THAT
THE
LIST
HAD
DISAPPEARED
AND
THEY
SHOULD
ASK
EVERYONE
WHO
HADNT
LEFT
FOR
THE
KHIMIK
BOARDING
HOUSE
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
ON
OUR
SECOND
LIST
I
THINK
THAT
THE
NUMBER
WAS
THE
ONE
THAT
GOT
INTO
THE
PRESS
AND
ONTO
TELEVISION
AND
THE
RADIO
BECAUSE
THATS
THE
LIST
THAT
DEMICHEV
GOT
I
REMEMBER
EXACTLY
THAT
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
LIST
I
HAD
EVEN
TOLD
ALEKSANDR
MIKHAILOVICH
THAT
THAT
WAS
ONLY
A
HALF
OF
THOSE
THAT
WERE
ON
THE
FIRST
LIST
HE
SAID
LYUDA
PLEASE
TRY
TO
REMEMBER
AT
LEAST
ONE
MORE
BUT
I
COULDNT
REMEMBER
ANYONE
ELSE
BUT
THERE
WERE
MORE
THAN
DEAD
OF
THAT
I
AM
CERTAIN
THE
GOVERNMENT
AND
THE
PROCURACY
DONT
COUNT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
DIED
OF
FRIGHT
LIKE
SICK
PEOPLE
AND
OLD
PEOPLE
WHOSE
LIVES
ARE
THREATENED
BY
ANY
SHOCK
THEY
WERENT
REGISTERED
AS
VICTIMS
OF
THE
SUMGAIT
TRAGEDY
AND
THEN
THERE
MAY
BE
PEOPLE
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
LEFT
SUMGAIT
BETWEEN
MARCH
AND
MOST
OF
THEM
LEFT
FOR
SMALLER
TOWNS
IN
RUSSIA
AND
ESPECIALLY
TO
THE
NORTHERN
CAUCASUS
TO
STAVROPOL
AND
THE
KRASNODARSK
TERRITORY
WE
DONT
HAVE
ANY
INFORMATION
ON
THEM
I
KNOW
THAT
THERE
ARE
PEOPLE
WHO
SET
OUT
FOR
PARTS
AROUND
MOSCOW
IN
THE
PERIODICAL
KRESTYANKA
WOMAN
FARMER
THERE
WAS
A
CALL
FOR
PEOPLE
WHO
KNOW
HOW
TO
MILK
COWS
AND
FOR
MECHANICS
AND
DRIVERS
AND
I
KNOW
A
WHOLE
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
WENT
TO
HELP
OUT
ALSO
CLEARLY
NOT
ON
OUR
LIST
ARE
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO
DIED
ENTERING
THE
CITY
WHO
WERE
BURNED
IN
THEIR
CARS
NO
ONE
KNOWS
ABOUT
THEM
EXCEPT
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
WHO
ARE
HARDLY
LIKELY
TO
SAY
ANYTHING
ABOUT
IT
AND
THERES
MORE
A
GREAT
MANY
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
RAPED
WERE
NOT
INCLUDED
IN
THE
LIST
DRAWN
UP
AT
THE
PROCURACY
I
KNOW
OF
THREE
INSTANCES
FOR
SURE
AND
I
OF
COURSE
DONT
KNOW
THEM
ALL
IM
THINKING
OF
THREE
WOMEN
WHOSE
PARENTS
CHOSE
NOT
TO
PUBLICIZE
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
THAT
IS
THEY
DIDNT
TAKE
THE
MATTER
TO
COURT
THEY
SIMPLY
LEFT
BUT
IN
SO
DOING
THEY
DIDNT
CEASE
BEING
VICTIMS
ONE
OF
THEM
IS
THE
FIRST
COUSIN
OF
MY
CLASSMATE
KOCHARIAN
SHE
LIVED
IN
MICRODISTRICT
NO
ON
THE
FIFTH
FLOOR
I
CANT
TELL
YOU
THE
BUILDING
NUMBER
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
HER
NAME
THEN
COMES
THE
NEIGHBOR
OF
ONE
OF
MY
RELATIVES
SHE
LIVED
IN
MICRODISTRICT
NEAR
THE
GIFT
SHOP
I
DONT
KNOW
HER
NAME
SHE
LIVES
ON
THE
SAME
LANDING
AS
THE
SUMGAIT
PROCURATOR
THEY
BEAT
HER
FATHER
HE
WAS
HOLDING
THE
DOOR
WHILE
HIS
DAUGHTER
HID
BUT
HE
COULDNT
HOLD
THE
DOOR
FOREVER
AND
WHEN
SHE
CLIMBED
OVER
THE
BALCONY
TO
THE
NEIGHBORS
THEY
SEIZED
HER
BY
HER
BRAID
LIKE
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
WERE
SAYING
IT
WAS
A
VERY
CULTURED
MOB
BECAUSE
THEY
DIDNT
KILL
ANYONE
THEY
ONLY
RAPED
THEM
AND
LEFT
AND
THE
THIRD
ONE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
WHO
THE
THIRD
ONE
WAS
ANYMORE
THEY
TRANSFERRED
US
ON
MARCH
KARINA
STILL
WASNT
HERSELF
YES
WE
LIVED
FOR
DAYS
IN
THE
SK
IN
THE
CULTURAL
FACILITY
AND
AT
THE
KHIMIK
THEY
LIVED
THERE
AND
I
LIVED
AT
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
BECAUSE
I
COULDNT
STAY
WITH
KARINA
IT
WAS
TOO
DIFFICULT
FOR
ME
BUT
I
WAS
AT
PEACE
SHE
HAD
SURVIVED
I
COULD
ALREADY
WALK
BUT
REALLY
IT
WAS
HONEST
WORDS
THAT
HELD
ME
UP
THANKS
TO
THE
SOCIAL
WORK
I
DID
THERE
I
MANAGED
TO
PERSEVERE
ALEKSANDR
MIKHAILOVICH
SAID
IF
IT
WERENT
FOR
THE
WORK
I
WOULD
GO
INSANE
HE
AND
I
PUT
OURSELVES
IN
GEAR
AND
TOOK
EVERYTHING
UPON
OURSELVES
SOMEONE
HAD
AN
INFANT
AND
NEEDED
DIAPERS
AND
FREE
FOOD
AND
WE
WENT
TO
GET
THEM
THE
FIRST
DAYS
WE
BOUGHT
EVERYTHING
ALTHOUGH
WE
SHOULD
HAVE
RECEIVED
IT
FOR
FREE
THEY
WERE
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
BEEN
DISPENSED
FREE
OF
CHARGE
AND
THEY
SOLD
IT
TO
US
THEN
WHEN
WE
FOUND
OUT
IT
WAS
FREE
WE
WENT
TO
KRAYEV
AT
THE
TIME
FORTUNATELY
YOU
COULD
STILL
DROP
BY
TO
SEE
HIM
LIKE
A
NEIGHBOR
ALL
THE
MORE
SO
SINCE
EVERYTHING
WAS
STILL
CLEARLY
VISIBLE
ON
OUR
FACES
KRAYEV
SENT
A
CAPTAIN
DOWN
AND
HE
RESOLVED
THE
ISSUE
ON
MARCH
THEY
SENT
TWO
INVESTIGATORS
TO
SEE
US
ANDREI
SHIROKOV
AND
VLADIMIR
FEDOROVICH
BIBISHEV
THE
WAY
IT
WORKED
OUT
IN
OUR
FAMILY
THEY
HAD
CONSIDERED
ONLY
KARINA
AND
ME
VICTIMS
MAYBE
BECAUSE
SHE
AND
I
WOUND
UP
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
MOTHER
AND
FATHER
ARE
CONSIDERED
WITNESSES
BUT
NOT
VICTIMS
SHIROKOV
WAS
INVOLVED
WITH
KARINAS
CASE
AND
BIBISHEV
WITH
MINE
AFTER
I
TOLD
HIM
EVERYTHING
HE
AND
I
PLANNED
TO
SIT
DOWN
WITH
THE
IDENTIKIT
AND
RECORD
EVERYONE
I
COULD
REMEMBER
WHILE
EVERYTHING
WAS
STILL
FRESH
IN
MY
MIND
WE
DIDNT
WORK
WITH
THE
IDENTIKIT
UNTIL
THE
VERY
LAST
DAY
BECAUSE
THE
CONDITIONS
WERENT
THERE
THE
INVESTIGATIVE
GROUP
WORKED
SLOWLY
AND
DID
POOR
QUALITY
WORK
SOLELY
BECAUSE
THE
SITUATION
WASNT
CONDUCIVE
TO
WORKING
THERE
WERENT
ENOUGH
AUTOMOBILES
ESPECIALLY
DURING
THE
TIME
WHEN
THERE
WAS
A
CURFEW
AND
THERE
WERE
NO
TYPEWRITERS
FOR
TYPING
TRANSCRIPTS
AND
NO
STILL
OR
VIDEO
CAMERAS
I
THINK
THAT
THIS
WAS
DONE
ON
PURPOSE
WERE
NOT
SO
POOR
THAT
WE
CANT
SUPPLY
OUR
INVESTIGATORS
WITH
ALL
THAT
STUFF
IT
WAS
DONE
ESPECIALLY
TO
DRAW
OUT
THE
INVESTIGATION
ALL
THE
MORE
SO
SINCE
THE
LOCAL
AUTHORITIES
SAW
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
WERE
LEAVING
AT
THE
SPEED
OF
LIGHT
NEVER
TO
RETURN
TO
SUMGAIT
AND
THE
ARMENIANS
HAD
A
LOT
TO
SAY
I
CAME
TO
AN
AGREEMENT
WITH
BIBISHEV
I
TOLD
HIM
MYSELF
DONT
YOU
WORRY
IF
IT
TAKES
US
A
MONTH
OR
TWO
MONTHS
ILL
BE
HERE
IM
NOT
AFRAID
I
LOOKED
DEATH
IN
THE
EYES
FIVE
TIMES
IN
THOSE
TWO
DAYS
ILL
HELP
YOU
CONDUCT
THE
INVESTIGATION
HE
AND
I
WORKED
TOGETHER
A
GREAT
DEAL
AND
I
USED
THIS
TO
SHELTER
KARINA
I
GAVE
THEM
SO
MUCH
TO
DO
THAT
FOR
A
WHILE
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
TIME
TO
GET
TO
HER
SO
THAT
SHE
WOULD
AT
LEAST
HAVE
A
WEEK
OR
TWO
TO
GET
BACK
TO
BEING
HER
SELF
SHE
WAS
HAVING
DIFFICULTY
BREATHING
SO
WE
LOOKED
FOR
A
DOCTOR
TO
TAKE
X
RAYS
SHE
COULDNT
EAT
OR
DRINK
FOR
NINE
DAYS
SHE
WAS
NAUSEOUS
I
DIDNT
EAT
AND
DRANK
VIRTUALLY
NOTHING
FOR
FIVE
DAYS
THEN
ON
THE
FIFTH
DAY
WHEN
WE
WERE
IN
BAKU
ALREADY
THE
INVESTIGATOR
TOLD
ME
HOW
LONG
CAN
YOU
GO
ON
LIKE
THIS
WELL
FINE
SO
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
EAT
YOU
DONT
LOVE
YOURSELF
YOURE
NOT
TAKING
CARE
OF
YOURSELF
BUT
YOU
GAVE
YOUR
WORD
THAT
YOU
WOULD
SEE
THIS
INVESTIGATION
THROUGH
WE
NEED
YOU
THEN
I
STARTED
EATING
BECAUSE
IN
FACT
I
WAS
EXHAUSTED
IT
WASNT
ENOUGH
THAT
I
KEPT
SEEING
THOSE
FACES
IN
OUR
APART
MENT
IN
MY
MIND
EVERY
DAY
I
WENT
TO
THE
INVESTIGATIVE
SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT
CELLS
AND
PRISONS
I
DONT
KNOW
WE
WERE
JUST
EVERYWHERE
PROBABLY
IN
EVERY
PRISON
IN
THE
CITY
OF
BAKU
AND
IN
ALL
THE
SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT
CELLS
OF
SUMGAIT
AT
THAT
TIME
THEY
HAD
EVEN
TURNED
THE
DRUNK
TANK
INTO
SOLITARY
CONFINEMENT
THUS
FAR
I
HAVE
IDENTIFIED
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
MAMMA
IDENTIFIED
THREE
AND
KARINA
TWO
THE
TOTAL
IS
MARINA
DIDNT
IDENTIFY
ANYONE
SHE
REMEMBERS
THE
FACES
OF
TWO
OR
THREE
BUT
THEY
WERENT
AMONG
THE
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
THOSE
DETAINED
I
TOLD
OF
THE
NEIGHBOR
I
RECOGNIZED
THE
ONE
WHO
WENT
AFTER
THE
AXE
HE
STILL
HASNT
BEEN
DETAINED
HES
STILL
ON
THE
LOOSE
HES
GONE
AND
ITS
NOT
CLEAR
IF
HE
WILL
BE
FOUND
OR
NOT
I
DONT
KNOW
HIS
FIRST
OR
LAST
NAME
I
KNOW
WHICH
BUILDING
HE
LIVED
IN
AND
I
KNOW
HIS
SISTERS
FACES
BUT
HES
NOT
IN
THE
CITY
THE
INVESTIGATORS
INFORMED
ME
THAT
EVEN
IF
THE
INVESTIGATION
IS
CLOSED
AND
EVEN
IF
THE
TRIAL
IS
OVER
THEY
WILL
CONTINUE
LOOKING
FOR
HIM
THE
PEOPLE
I
IDENTIFIED
ARE
LARGELY
BLUECOLLAR
WORKERS
FROM
VARIOUS
PLANTS
WITHOUT
EDUCATION
AND
OF
THE
VERY
LOWEST
LEVEL
IN
EVERY
RESPECT
MOSTLY
THEIR
AGES
RANGE
FROM
TO
YEARS
THERE
WAS
ONE
WHO
WAS
ONLY
ONE
OF
THEM
WAS
A
STUDENT
HE
WAS
ATTENDING
THE
AZERBAIJAN
PETROLEUM
AND
CHEMICAL
INSTITUTE
IN
SUMGAIT
HIS
MOTHER
KEPT
TRYING
TO
BRIBE
THE
INVESTIGA
TOR
ONCE
THINKING
THAT
I
WAS
AN
EMPLOYEE
AND
NOT
A
VICTIM
SHE
SAID
IN
FRONT
OF
ME
ILL
SET
YOU
UP
A
RESTAURANT
WORTH
RUBLES
AND
GIVE
YOU
IN
CASH
SIMPLY
FOR
KEEPING
HIM
OUT
OF
ARMENIA
THAT
IS
TO
KEEP
HIM
FROM
LANDING
IN
A
PRISON
ON
ARMENIAN
SOIL
THEYRE
ALL
TERRIBLY
AFRAID
OF
THAT
BECAUSE
IF
THE
INVESTIGATOR
IS
TALKING
WITH
A
CRIMINAL
AND
THE
CRIMINAL
DOESNT
CONFESS
EVEN
THOUGH
WE
IDENTIFIED
HIM
THEY
TELL
HIMIN
ORDER
TO
APPLY
PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURETHEY
SAY
FINE
DONT
CONFESS
JUST
KEEP
SILENT
WHEN
YOURE
IN
AN
ARMENIAN
PRISON
WHEN
THEY
FIND
OUT
WHO
YOU
ARE
THEYLL
TAKE
CARE
OF
YOU
IN
SHORT
ORDER
THAT
SOMEHOW
GETS
TO
THEM
MANY
GIVE
IN
AND
START
TO
TALK
THE
INVESTIGATORS
AND
I
WERE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
AND
VIDEOTAPED
THE
ENTIRE
POGROM
OF
OUR
APARTMENT
AS
AN
INVESTIGATIVE
EXPERIMENT
IT
WAS
ONLY
THEN
THAT
I
SAW
THE
WAY
THEY
HAD
LEFT
OUR
APARTMENT
EVEN
WITHOUT
KNOWING
WHO
WAS
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
YOU
COULD
GUESS
THEY
STOLE
FOR
EXAMPLE
ALL
THE
MONEY
AND
ALL
THE
VALUABLES
BUT
DIDNT
TAKE
A
SINGLE
BOOK
THEY
TORE
THEM
UP
BURNED
THEM
POURED
WATER
ON
THEM
AND
HACKED
THEM
WITH
AXES
ONLY
THE
MATERIALS
FROM
THE
CONGRESS
OF
THE
COMMUNIST
PARTY
OF
THE
SOVIET
UNION
AND
JAMES
FENIMORE
COOPERS
LAST
OF
THE
MOHIGANS
OH
YES
LUNCH
WAS
READY
WE
WERE
BOILING
A
CHICKEN
AND
THERE
WERE
LEMONS
FOR
TEA
ON
THE
TABLE
AFTER
THEY
HAD
BEEN
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
BOTH
THE
CHICKEN
AND
THE
LEMONS
WERE
GONE
THATS
ENOUGH
TO
TELL
YOU
WHAT
KIND
OF
PEOPLE
WERE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
PEOPLE
WHO
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
ANYTHING
ABOUT
BOOKS
THEY
DIDNT
TAKE
A
SINGLE
BOOK
BUT
THEY
DID
TAKE
WORN
CLOTHING
FOOD
AND
EVEN
THE
CHEAPEST
OF
THE
CHEAP
WORNOUT
SLIPPERS
OF
THOSE
WHOM
I
IDENTIFIED
FOUR
WERE
KAFAN
AZERBAIJANIS
LIVING
IN
SUMGAIT
BASICALLY
THE
GROUP
THAT
WENT
SEEKING
REVENGELETS
USE
THEIR
WORD
FOR
ITWAS
JOINED
BY
PEOPLE
SEEKING
EASY
GAIN
AND
THRILLSEEKERS
I
TALKED
WITH
ONE
OF
THEM
HE
HAD
GRAY
EYES
AND
SOMEHOW
AGAINST
THE
BACKDROP
OF
ALL
THAT
BLACK
I
REMEMBERED
HIM
SPECIFICALLY
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
OF
HIS
EYES
BESIDES
TAKING
PART
IN
THE
POGROM
OF
OUR
APARTMENT
HE
WAS
ALSO
INVOLVED
IN
THE
MURDER
OF
TAMARA
MEKHTIYEVA
FROM
BUILDING
SHE
WAS
AN
OLDER
ARMENIAN
WHO
HAD
RECENTLY
ARRIVED
FROM
GEORGIA
SHE
LIVED
ALONE
AND
DID
NOT
HAVE
ANYONE
IN
SUMGAIT
I
DONT
KNOW
WHY
SHE
HAD
A
LAST
NAME
LIKE
THAT
MAYBE
SHE
WAS
MARRIED
TO
AN
AZERBAIJANI
I
HAD
LAID
EYES
ON
THIS
WOMAN
ONLY
ONCE
OR
TWICE
AND
KNOW
NOTHING
ABOUT
HER
I
DO
KNOW
THAT
THEY
MURDERED
HER
IN
HER
APARTMENT
WITH
AN
AXE
MURDERING
HER
WASNT
ENOUGH
FOR
THEM
THEY
HACKED
HER
INTO
PIECES
AND
THREW
THEM
INTO
THE
TUB
WITH
WATER
I
REMEMBER
ANOTHER
GUY
REALLY
WELL
TOO
HE
WAS
ALSO
RATHER
FAIRSKINNED
YOU
KNOW
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
WERE
DARKER
THAN
DARK
BOTH
THEIR
HAIR
AND
THEIR
SKIN
AND
IN
CONTRAST
WITH
THEM
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
GREY
EYED
ONE
I
REMEMBER
THIS
ONE
FELLOW
THE
ONE
L
TOOK
TO
BE
A
LEZGIN
I
IDENTIFIED
HIM
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT
HE
WAS
EDUARD
ROBERTOVICH
GRIGORIAN
BORN
IN
THE
CITY
OF
SUMGAIT
AND
HE
HAD
BEEN
CONVICTED
TWICE
ONE
OF
OUR
OWN
HOW
DID
I
REMEMBER
HIM
THE
NAME
RITA
WAS
TATTOOED
ON
HIS
LEFT
OR
RIGHT
HAND
I
KEPT
THINKING
IS
THAT
RITA
OR
PUMA
WHICH
IT
WOULD
BE
IF
YOU
READ
THE
WORD
AS
LATIN
CHARACTERS
INSTEAD
OF
CYRILLIC
BECAUSE
THE
CYRILLIC
T
WAS
THE
ONE
THAT
LOOKS
LIKE
A
LATIN
M
WHEN
THEY
LED
HIM
IN
HE
SAT
WITH
HIS
HANDS
BEHIND
HIS
BACK
THIS
WAS
AT
THE
CONFRONTATION
HE
SWORE
ON
EVERY
HOLY
BOOK
TRIED
TO
PUT
IN
AN
ARMENIAN
WORD
HERE
AND
THERE
TO
TRY
AND
SPARK
MY
COMPASSION
AND
TOLD
ME
THAT
I
WAS
MAKING
A
MISTAKE
AND
CALLED
ME
DEAR
SISTER
HE
SAID
YOURE
WRONG
HOW
COULD
I
AN
ARMENIAN
RAISE
MY
HAND
AGAINST
MY
OWN
AN
ARMENIAN
AND
SO
ON
HE
SPOKE
SO
CONVINCINGLY
THAT
EVEN
THE
INVESTIGATOR
ASKED
ME
LYUDA
ARE
YOU
SURE
IT
WAS
HE
I
TOLD
HIM
ILL
TELL
YOU
ONE
MORE
IDENTIFYING
MARK
IF
IM
WRONG
I
SHALL
APOLOGIZE
AND
SAY
I
WAS
MISTAKEN
THE
NAME
RITA
IS
TATTOOED
ON
HIS
LEFT
OR
RIGHT
HAND
HE
WENT
RIGID
AND
BECAME
PALE
THEY
TOLD
HIM
PUT
YOUR
HANDS
ON
THE
TABLE
HE
PUT
HIS
HANDS
ON
THE
TABLE
WITH
THE
PALMS
UP
I
SAID
NOW
TURN
YOUR
HANDS
OVER
BUT
HE
DIDNT
TURN
HIS
HANDS
OVER
NOW
THIS
INFURIATED
ME
IF
HE
HAD
FROM
THE
VERY
START
ACKNOWLEDGED
HIS
GUILT
AND
SAID
THAT
HE
HADNT
WANTED
TO
DO
IT
THAT
THEY
FORCED
HIM
OR
SOMETHING
ELSE
I
WOULD
HAVE
TREATED
HIM
SOMEWHAT
DIFFERENTLY
BUT
HE
INSOLENTLY
STUCK
TO
HIS
STORY
NO
I
DID
NOT
DO
ANYTHING
IT
WASNT
ME
WHEN
THEY
TURNED
HIS
HANDS
OVER
THE
NAME
RITA
WAS
IN
FACT
TATTOOED
ON
HIS
HAND
HIS
FACE
DISTORTED
AND
HE
WHISPERED
SOMETHING
WICKED
I
IMMEDIATELY
FLEW
INTO
A
RAGE
THERE
WAS
AN
ASHTRAY
ON
THE
TABLE
A
REALLY
HEAVY
ONE
MADE
OUT
OF
GRANITE
OR
SOMETHING
VERY
LARGE
AND
IT
HAD
ASHES
AND
BUTTS
IN
IT
CATCHING
MYSELF
QUITE
BY
SURPRISE
I
HURLED
THAT
ASHTRAY
AT
HIM
BUT
HE
DUCKED
AND
THE
ASHTRAY
HIT
THE
WALL
AND
ASHES
AND
BUTTS
RAINED
DOWN
ON
HIS
HEAD
AND
BACK
AND
HE
SMILED
WHEN
HE
SMILED
IT
PROVOKED
ME
FURTHER
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
BUT
I
JUMPED
OVER
THE
TABLE
BETWEEN
US
AND
STARTED
EITHER
POUNDING
HIM
OR
STRANGLING
HIM
I
NO
LONGER
REMEMBER
WHICH
WHEN
I
JUMPED
I
CAUGHT
THE
MICROPHONE
CORD
THE
INVESTIGATOR
WAS
THERE
TOLYA
I
NO
LONGER
RECALL
HIS
LAST
NAME
AND
HE
SAYS
LYUDOCHKA
ITS
A
JAPANESE
MICROPHONE
PLEASE
AND
SHUT
OFF
ALL
THE
EQUIPMENT
ON
THE
SPOT
IT
WAS
ALL
BEING
VIDEO
TAPED
THEY
TOOK
HIM
AWAY
I
STAYED
AND
THEY
TALKED
TO
ME
A
LITTLE
TO
CALM
ME
DOWN
BECAUSE
WE
NEEDED
TO
GO
ON
WORKING
I
ONLY
REMEMBER
TOLYA
TELLING
ME
YOURE
SOME
ACTRESS
WHAT
A
PERFORMANCE
I
SAID
TOLYA
HONESTLY
BEFOREHAND
THEY
WOULD
ALWAYS
TELL
ME
LYUDA
MORE
EMOTION
YOU
SPEAK
AS
CALMLY
AS
IF
NOTHING
HAD
HAPPENED
TO
YOU
I
SAY
I
DONT
HAVE
ANY
MORE
STRENGTH
OR
EMOTION
ALL
MY
EMOTIONS
ARE
BEHIND
ME
NOW
I
NO
LONGER
HAVE
THE
STRENGTH
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
STRENGTH
TO
DO
ANYTHING
AND
HE
SAYS
LYUDA
HOW
WERE
YOU
ABLE
TO
DO
THAT
AND
WHEN
I
RETURNED
TO
NORMAL
DRINKING
TEA
AND
WATCHING
THE
TAPE
I
SAID
CAN
I
REALLY
HAVE
JUMPED
OVER
THAT
TABLE
I
NEVER
JUMPED
THAT
HIGH
IN
GYM
CLASS
SO
YOU
COULD
SAY
THE
GANG
THAT
TOOK
OVER
OUR
APARTMENT
WAS
INTERNATIONAL
OF
THE
WE
IDENTIFIED
THERE
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
A
RUSSIAN
VADIM
VOROBYEV
WHO
BEAT
MAMMA
AND
AZERBAIJANIS
AT
THE
SECOND
MEETING
WITH
GRIGORIAN
WHEN
HE
HAD
COMPLETELY
CONFESSED
HIS
GUILT
HE
TOLD
OF
HOW
ON
FEBRUARY
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
HAD
COME
KNOCKING
AMONG
THEM
WERE
GUYSIF
YOU
CAN
CALL
THEM
GUYSHE
KNEW
FROM
PRISON
THEY
SAID
TOMORROW
WERE
GOING
AFTER
THE
ARMENIANS
MEET
US
AT
THE
BUS
STATION
AT
THREE
OCLOCK
HE
SAID
NO
IM
NOT
COMING
THEY
TOLD
HIM
IF
YOU
DONT
COME
WELL
KILL
YOU
HE
SAID
ALRIGHT
ILL
COME
AND
HE
WENT
THEY
ALSO
WENT
TO
VISIT
MY
CLASSMATE
FROM
OUR
MICRODISTRICT
KAMO
POGOSIAN
HE
HAD
ALSO
BEEN
IN
PRISON
I
THINK
THAT
TOGETHER
THEY
HAD
EITHER
STOLEN
A
MOTORCYCLE
OR
DISMANTLED
ONE
TO
GET
SOME
PARTS
THEY
NEEDED
THEY
CALLED
HIM
OUT
OF
HIS
APARTMENT
AND
TOLD
HIM
THE
SAME
THING
TOMORROW
WERE
GOING
TO
GET
THE
ARMENIANS
BE
THERE
HE
SAID
NO
THEY
PULLED
A
KNIFE
ON
HIM
HE
SAID
IM
NOT
GOING
ALL
THE
SAME
AND
IN
THE
COURTYARD
ON
THE
THEY
STABBED
HIM
SEVERAL
TIMES
IN
THE
STOMACH
HE
WAS
TAKEN
TO
THE
HOSPITAL
I
KNOW
HE
WAS
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
IN
BAKU
IN
THE
REPUBLIC
HOSPITAL
IF
WE
HAD
KNOWN
ABOUT
THAT
WE
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
SOME
IDEA
OF
WHAT
WAS
TO
COME
ON
THE
ILL
RETURN
TO
GRIGORIAN
WHAT
HE
DID
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
I
REMEMBER
THAT
HE
BEAT
ME
ALONG
WITH
ALL
THE
REST
HE
SPOKE
AZERBAIJANI
EXTREMELY
WELL
BUT
HE
WAS
VERY
FAIRSKINNED
MAYBE
THAT
LED
ME
TO
THINK
THAT
THEY
HAD
IT
OUT
FOR
HIM
TOO
BUT
LATER
IT
WAS
PROVED
THAT
HE
TOOK
PART
IN
THE
BEATING
AND
BURNING
OF
SHAGEN
SARGISIAN
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
HE
PARTICIPATED
IN
THE
RAPES
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
I
DIDNT
SEE
I
DONT
REMEMBER
BUT
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
WHO
DIDNT
YET
KNOW
THAT
HE
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
SAID
THAT
HE
DID
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
HE
CONFESSED
OR
NOT
AND
I
MYSELF
DONT
RECALL
BECAUSE
I
BLACKED
OUT
VERY
OFTEN
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
HE
DIDNT
PARTICIPATE
IN
THE
RAPE
OF
KARINA
BECAUSE
HE
WAS
IN
THE
APARTMENT
THE
WHOLE
TIME
WHEN
THEY
CARRIED
HER
INTO
THE
COURTYARD
HE
REMAINED
IN
THE
APARTMENT
AT
ONE
POINT
I
WAS
TALKING
WITH
AN
ACQUAINTANCE
ABOUT
EDIK
GRIGORIAN
FROM
HER
I
LEARNED
THAT
HIS
WIFE
WAS
A
DRESSMAKER
HIS
MOTHER
IS
RUSSIAN
HE
DOESNT
HAVE
A
FATHER
AND
THAT
HES
BEEN
CONVICTED
TWICE
WELL
THIS
WILL
BE
HIS
THIRD
AND
I
HOPE
LAST
SENTENCE
HE
BEAT
HIS
WIFE
SHE
WAS
ETERNALLY
COMING
TO
WORK
WITH
BRUISES
HIS
WIFE
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
BY
THE
NAME
OF
RITA
THE
OTHERS
WHO
WERE
DETAINED
WELL
THEYRE
LITTLE
BEASTS
YOU
REALLY
CANT
CALL
THEM
BEASTS
THEYRE
JUST
LITTLE
BEASTS
THEY
WERE
ROBOTS
CARRYING
OUT
SOMEONE
ELSES
WILL
BECAUSE
AT
THE
INVESTIGATION
THEY
ALL
SAID
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
HOW
I
COULD
HAVE
DONE
THAT
I
WAS
OUT
OF
MY
HEAD
BUT
WE
KNOW
THAT
THEY
WERE
WON
AROUND
TO
IT
AND
PREPARED
FOR
IT
THATS
WHY
THEY
DID
IT
IN
THE
NAME
OF
ALLAH
IN
THE
NAME
OF
THE
KORAN
IN
THE
NAME
OF
PROPAGATING
ISLAM
THATS
HOLY
TO
THEMTHATS
WHY
THEY
DID
EVERYTHING
THEY
WERE
COMMANDED
TO
DO
BECAUSE
I
SAW
THEY
DIDNT
HAVE
MINDS
OF
THEIR
OWN
IM
NOT
TALKING
ABOUT
THEIR
LEVEL
OF
CULTURAL
SOPHISTICATION
OR
ANY
HIGHER
VALUES
NO
EDUCATION
THEY
WORK
HAVE
A
SLEW
OF
CHILDREN
WITHOUT
THE
MEANS
TO
RAISE
THEM
PROPERLY
THEY
CROWD
THEM
IN
LIKE
AT
THE
TEMPORARY
HOUSING
AND
APPARENTLY
THEY
WERE
PROMISED
THAT
IF
THEY
SLAUGHTERED
THE
ARMENIANS
THEY
WOULD
RECEIVE
APARTMENTS
SO
OFF
THEY
WENT
MANY
OF
THEM
EXPLAINED
THEIR
PARTICIPATION
SAYING
THEY
PROMISED
US
APARTMENTS
AMONG
THEM
WAS
ONE
WHO
GENUINELY
REPENTED
I
AM
SURE
THAT
HE
REPENTED
FROM
THE
HEART
AND
THAT
HE
JUST
DESPISED
HIMSELF
AFTER
THE
INCIDENT
HE
WORKED
AT
A
CHILDRENS
HOME
AN
AZERBAIJANI
HE
HAS
TWO
CHILDREN
AND
HIS
WIFE
WORKS
AT
THE
CHILDRENS
HOME
TOO
EVERYTHING
THAT
THEY
ACQUIRED
EVERYTHING
THAT
THEY
HAVE
THEY
EARNED
BY
THEIR
OWN
LABOR
AND
WASNT
INHERITED
FROM
PARENTS
OR
GRANDPARENTS
AND
HE
SAID
I
DIDNT
NEED
ANYTHING
I
JUST
DONT
KNOW
HOW
I
ENDED
UP
IN
THAT
IT
WAS
LIKE
SOME
HAND
WAS
GUIDING
ME
I
HAD
NO
WILL
OF
MY
OWN
I
HAD
NO
STRENGTH
NO
MASCULINE
DIGNITY
NOTHING
AND
THE
WHOLE
TIME
I
KEPT
REPEATING
NOW
YOU
IMAGINE
THAT
SOMEONE
DID
THE
SAME
TO
YOUR
YOUNG
WIFE
RIGHT
BEFORE
YOUR
OWN
EYES
HE
SAT
THERE
AND
JUST
WAILED
BUT
THAT
LEADER
IN
THE
ESKIMO
DOGSKIN
COAT
WAS
NOT
DETAINED
HE
PERFORMED
A
MARVELOUS
DISAPPEARING
ACT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
THEYLL
GET
ONTO
HIM
THEY
JUST
HAVE
TO
WORK
A
LITTLE
BECAUSE
THAT
VADIM
THAT
BOY
ACCORDING
TO
HIS
GRANDFATHER
IS
IN
TOUCH
WITH
THE
YOUNG
PERSON
WHO
TAUGHT
HIM
WHAT
TO
DO
HOW
TO
COVER
HIS
TRACKS
HE
WAS
CONSTANTLY
EXCHANGING
JACKETS
WITH
OTHER
BOYS
HE
KNEW
AND
THOSE
HE
DIDNT
EITHER
AND
OTHER
THINGS
AS
WELL
AND
CHANGED
HIMSELF
LIKE
A
CHAMELEON
SO
THEY
WOULDNT
GET
ONTO
HIM
BUT
HE
WAS
DETAINED
THAT
ONE
IN
THE
ESKIMO
DOGSKIN
COAT
WAS
AT
THE
GAMBARIANS
AFTER
ALEKSANDR
GAMBARIAN
WAS
MURDERED
HE
CAME
IN
AND
SAID
LETS
GO
ENOUGH
YOUVE
SPILLED
ENOUGH
BLOOD
HERE
MAYBE
KARINA
DOESNT
KNOW
THIS
BUT
THE
REASON
THEY
DIDNT
FINISH
HER
OFF
WAS
THAT
THEY
WERE
HOPING
TO
TAKE
HER
HOME
WITH
THEM
I
HEARD
THIS
FROM
AUNT
TANYA
AND
HER
SONS
THE
KASUMOVS
WHO
WERE
IN
THE
COURTYARD
NEAR
THE
ENTRYWAY
THEY
LIKED
HER
VERY
MUCH
AND
THEY
HAD
DECIDED
TO
TAKE
HER
TO
HOME
WITH
THEM
WHEN
KARINA
CAME
TO
AT
ONE
POINTSHE
DOESNT
REMEMBER
THIS
YET
THIS
THE
NEIGHBORS
OLD
MEAND
SHE
SAW
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
ONE
AROUND
HER
SHE
STARTED
CRAWLING
TO
THE
ENTRYWAY
THEY
SAW
THAT
SHE
WAS
STILL
ALIVE
AND
CAME
BACK
THEY
WERE
ALREADY
AT
THE
THIRD
ENTRYWAY
ON
THEIR
WAY
TO
THE
GAMBARIANS
THEY
CAME
BACK
AND
STARTED
BEATING
HER
TO
FINISH
HER
IF
SHE
HAD
NOT
COME
TO
SHE
WOULD
HAVE
SUSTAINED
LESSER
BODILY
INJURIES
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
BEAT
HER
LESS
AN
OLDER
WOMAN
FROM
OUR
BUILDING
AUNT
NAZAN
AN
AZERBAIJANI
ALL
BUT
LAY
ON
TOP
OF
KARINA
CRYING
AND
PLEADING
THAT
THEY
LEAVE
HER
ALONE
BUT
THEY
FLUNG
HER
OFF
THE
WOMANS
GROWN
SONS
WERE
RIGHT
NEARBY
THEY
PICKED
HER
UP
IN
THEIR
HANDS
AND
LED
HER
HOME
SHE
HOWLED
AND
CRIED
OUT
LOUDLY
AND
SWORE
GOD
IS
ON
EARTH
HE
SEES
EVERYTHING
AND
HE
WONT
FORGIVE
THIS
THERE
WAS
ANOTHER
WOMAN
TOO
AUNT
FATIMA
A
SICK
AGING
WOMAN
FROM
THE
FIRST
FLOOR
SHES
ALREADY
RETIRED
MOUNTAIN
DWELLERS
AND
AZERBAIJANIS
TOO
HAVE
A
CUSTOM
IF
MEN
ARE
FIGHTING
THEY
THROW
A
SCARF
UNDER
THEIR
FEET
TO
STOP
THEM
BUT
THEY
TRAMPLED
HER
SCARF
AND
SENT
HER
HOME
TO
TRAMPLE
A
SCARF
IS
TANTAMOUNT
TO
TRAMPLING
A
WOMANS
HONOR
NOW
THAT
THE
INVESTIGATION
IS
GOING
ON
NOW
THAT
A
LOT
IS
BEHIND
US
AND
WE
HAVE
GOTTEN
BACK
TO
BEING
OURSELVES
A
LITTLE
I
THINK
ABOUT
HOW
COULD
THESE
EVENTS
THAT
ARE
NOW
CALLED
THE
SUMGAIT
TRAGEDY
HAPPEN
HOW
DID
THEY
COME
ABOUT
HOW
DID
IT
START
COULD
IT
HAVE
BEEN
AVOIDED
WELL
ITS
CLEAR
THAT
WITHOUT
A
SIGNAL
WITHOUT
PERMISSION
FROM
THE
TOP
LEADERSHIP
IT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
HAPPENED
ALL
THE
SAME
IM
NOT
AFRAID
TO
SAY
THIS
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
LET
OTHER
WORTHY
PEOPLE
TAKE
NO
OFFENSE
THE
BETTER
REPRESENTATIVES
OF
THEIR
NATIONS
LET
THEM
TAKE
NO
OFFENSE
BUT
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
IN
THEIR
MAJORITY
ARE
A
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
KEPT
IN
LINE
ONLY
BY
FEAR
OF
THE
LAW
FEAR
OF
RETRIBUTION
FOR
WHAT
THEY
HAVE
DONE
AND
WHEN
THE
LAW
SAID
THAT
THEY
COULD
DO
ALL
THAT
LIKE
UNLEASHED
DOGS
WHO
WERE
AFRAID
THEY
WOULDNT
HAVE
TIME
TO
DO
EVERYTHING
THEY
THREW
THEMSELVES
FROM
ONE
THING
TO
THE
NEXT
SO
AS
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
GET
MORE
DONE
TO
SNATCH
A
BIT
MORE
THE
SMELL
OF
THE
DANGER
WAS
ALREADY
IN
THE
AIR
ON
FEBRUARY
YOU
COULD
TELL
THAT
SOMETHING
WAS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
AND
EVERYONE
WHO
HAD
FIGURED
IT
OUT
TOOK
STEPS
TO
AVOID
RUNNING
INTO
THOSE
GANGS
MANY
LEFT
FOR
THEIR
DACHAS
GOT
PLANE
TICKETS
FOR
THE
OTHER
END
OF
THE
COUNTRY
JUST
GOT
AS
FAR
AWAY
AS
THEIR
LEGS
WOULD
CARRY
THEM
FEBRUARY
WAS
A
SATURDAY
I
WAS
TEACHING
MY
THIRD
CLASS
THE
DIRECTOR
CAME
INTO
MY
CLASSROOM
AND
SAID
THAT
I
SHOULD
LET
THE
CHILDREN
OUT
THAT
THERE
HAD
BEEN
A
CALL
FROM
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
ASKING
THAT
ALL
TEACHERS
GATHER
FOR
A
MEETING
AT
LENIN
SQUARE
WELL
I
EXCUSED
THE
CHILDREN
AND
THERE
WERE
FEW
TEACHERS
LEFT
AT
SCHOOL
ALTOGETHER
THREE
WOMEN
THE
DIRECTOR
AND
SIX
OR
SEVEN
MEN
THE
REST
HAD
ALREADY
GONE
HOME
WE
GOT
TO
LENIN
SQUARE
AND
THERE
WERE
A
GREAT
MANY
PEOPLE
THERE
THIS
WAS
AROUND
FIVETHIRTY
OR
SIX
IN
THE
EVENING
NO
LATER
THEY
WERE
SAYING
ALL
KINDS
OF
RUBBISH
UP
ON
THE
PODIUM
AND
THE
CROWD
BELOW
WAS
SUPPORTING
THEM
STORMILY
ROARING
THEY
SPOKE
OVER
THE
MICROPHONE
ABOUT
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
IN
KAFAN
A
FEW
DAYS
EARLIER
AND
THAT
THE
DRIVER
OF
A
BUS
GOING
TO
SOME
DISTRICT
HAD
RECENTLY
THROWN
A
SMALL
AZERBAIJANI
CHILD
OFF
THE
BUS
THE
SPEAKER
AFFIRMED
THAT
HE
WAS
AN
EYEWITNESS
THAT
HE
HAD
SEEN
IT
HIMSELFTHE
CROWD
STARTED
TO
RAGE
DEATH
TO
THE
ARMENIANS
THEY
MUST
BE
KILLED
THEN
A
WOMAN
WENT
UP
ON
STAGE
I
DIDNT
SEE
THE
WOMAN
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
WERE
CLINGING
TO
THE
PODIUM
LIKE
FLIES
I
COULD
ONLY
HEAR
HER
THE
WOMAN
INTRODUCED
HERSELF
AS
COMING
FROM
KAFAN
AND
SAID
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
CUT
HER
DAUGHTERS
BREASTS
OFF
AND
CALLED
SONS
AVENGE
MY
DAUGHTERS
THAT
WAS
ENOUGH
A
PORTION
OF
THE
PEOPLE
ON
THE
SQUARE
TOOK
OFF
RUNNING
IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF
THE
FACTORIES
TOWARD
THE
BEGINNING
OF
LENIN
STREET
WE
STOOD
THERE
ABOUT
AN
HOUR
THEN
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
SCHOOL
SPOKE
HE
GAVE
A
VERY
NATIONALIST
SPEECH
HE
SAID
BROTHER
MUSLIMS
KILL
THE
ARMENIANS
THIS
HE
REPEATED
EVERY
OTHER
SENTENCE
WHEN
HE
SAID
THIS
THE
CROWD
SUPPORTED
HIM
STORMILY
WHISTLING
AND
SHOUTING
KARABAGH
HE
SAID
KARABAGH
HAS
BEEN
OUR
TERRITORY
MY
WHOLE
LIFE
LONG
KARABAGH
IS
MY
SOUL
HOW
CAN
YOU
TEAR
OUT
MY
HEART
AS
THOUGH
AN
AZERBAIJANI
WOULD
DIE
WITHOUT
KARABAGH
ITS
OUR
TERRITORY
THE
ARMENIANS
WILL
NEVER
SEE
IT
THE
ARMENIANS
MUST
BE
ELIMINATED
FROM
TIME
IMMEMORIAL
MUSLIMS
HAVE
CLEANSED
THE
LAND
OF
INFIDEL
ARMENIANS
FROM
TIME
IMMEMORIAL
THATS
THE
WAY
NATURE
CREATED
IT
THAT
EVERY
TO
YEARS
THE
AZERBAIJANIS
SHOULD
CLEANSE
THE
LAND
OF
FILTH
BY
FILTH
HE
MEANT
ARMENIANS
I
HEARD
THIS
BEFORE
THAT
I
HADNT
BEEN
LISTENING
TO
THE
SPEECHES
CLOSELY
MANY
PEOPLE
SPOKE
AND
I
STOOD
WITH
MY
BACK
TO
THE
PODIUM
TALKING
SHOP
WITH
THE
OTHER
TEACHERS
AND
SOMEHOW
IT
ALL
WENT
RIGHT
BY
IT
DIDNT
PENETRATE
THAT
IN
FACT
SOMETHING
SERIOUS
WAS
TAKING
PLACE
THEN
WHEN
ONE
OF
OUR
TEACHERS
SAID
LISTEN
TO
WHAT
HES
SAYING
LISTEN
TO
WHAT
IDIOCY
HES
SPOUTING
WE
LISTENED
THAT
WAS
THE
SPEECH
OF
THAT
DIRECTOR
BEFORE
THAT
WE
LISTENED
TO
THE
WOMANS
SPEECH
RIGHT
THEN
IN
OUR
GROUPTHERE
WERE
NINE
OF
USTHE
MOOD
CHANGED
AND
THE
SUBJECT
OF
CONVERSATION
AND
ALL
SCHOOL
MATTERS
WERE
FORGOTTEN
OUR
DIRECTOR
OF
STUDIES
FOR
WHOM
I
HAD
GREAT
RESPECT
HES
AN
AZERBAIJANI
BEFORE
THAT
I
HAD
CONSIDERED
HIM
AN
UPSTANDING
AND
WORTHY
PERSON
IF
THERE
WAS
A
NEED
TO
OBTAIN
LEAVE
WE
HAD
ASKED
HIM
HE
SEEMED
LIKE
A
GOOD
PERSON
SO
HE
TELLS
ME
LYUDA
YOU
KNOW
THAT
BESIDES
YOU
THERE
ARE
NO
ARMENIANS
ON
THE
SQUARE
IF
THEY
FIND
OUT
THAT
YOURE
AN
ARMENIAN
THEYLL
TEAR
YOU
TO
PIECES
SHOULD
I
TELL
THEM
YOURE
AN
ARMENIAN
SHOULD
I
TELL
THEM
YOURE
AN
ARMENIAN
WHEN
HE
SAID
IT
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
PRETENDED
NOT
TO
HEAR
IT
AND
THEN
HE
ASKED
ME
A
SECOND
TIME
I
TURNED
TO
THE
DIRECTOR
KHUDUROVA
AND
SAID
THAT
IT
WAS
ALREADY
AFTER
EIGHT
I
WAS
EXPECTED
AT
HOME
AND
I
SHOULD
BE
LEAVING
SHE
ANSWERED
NO
THEY
SAID
THAT
WOMEN
SHOULD
STAY
HERE
UNTIL
TEN
OCLOCKAND
MEN
UNTIL
TWELVE
STAY
HERE
THERE
WAS
A
YOUNG
TEACHER
WITH
US
HER
CHILDREN
WERE
IN
KINDERGARTEN
AND
HER
HUSBAND
WORKED
SHIFTS
SHE
ASKED
TO
LEAVE
I
LEFT
MY
CHILDREN
AT
THE
KINDERGARTEN
THE
DIRECTOR
EXCUSED
HER
WHEN
SHE
LET
HER
GO
I
TURNED
AROUND
SAID
GOODBYE
AND
LEFT
WITH
THE
YOUNG
TEACHER
THE
AZERBAIJANI
I
DIDNT
SEE
THEM
AFTER
THAT
WHEN
WE
WERE
WALKING
THE
BUSES
WERENT
RUNNING
AND
A
CROWD
FROM
THE
RALLY
RAN
NEARBY
US
THEY
HAD
APPARENTLY
GOTTEN
ALL
FIRED
UP
IT
MUST
HAVE
BECOME
TOO
MUCH
FOR
THEM
AND
THEY
WANTED
TO
SEEK
VENGEANCE
IMMEDIATELY
SO
THEY
RUSHED
OFF
I
WASNT
AFRAID
THIS
TIME
BECAUSE
I
WAS
SURE
THAT
THE
OTHER
TEACHER
WOULDNT
SAY
THAT
I
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
TO
MAKE
IT
SHORT
WE
REACHED
HOME
THEN
KARINA
TOLD
OF
HOW
THEY
HAD
BEEN
AT
THE
MOVIES
AND
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
THERE
I
STARTED
TELLING
OF
MY
EXPERIENCE
AND
AGAIN
MY
PARENTS
DIDNT
UNDERSTAND
THAT
WE
WERE
IN
DANGER
WE
WATCHED
TELEVISION
AS
USUAL
AND
DIDNT
EVEN
IMAGINE
THAT
TOMORROW
WOULD
BE
OUR
LAST
DAY
THATS
HOW
IT
ALL
WAS
AT
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
I
MET
AN
ACQUAINTANCE
WE
WENT
TO
SCHOOL
TOGETHER
ZHANNA
I
DONT
REMEMBER
HER
LAST
NAME
SHE
LIVES
ABOVE
THE
HOUSEWARES
STORE
ON
NARIMANOV
STREET
SHE
WAS
THERE
WITH
HER
FATHER
FOR
SOME
REASON
SHE
DOESNT
HAVE
A
MOTHER
THE
TWO
OF
THEM
WERE
AT
HOME
ALONE
WHILE
HER
FATHER
HELD
THE
DOOR
SHE
JUMPED
FROM
THE
THIRD
FLOOR
AND
SHE
WAS
LUCKY
THAT
THE
GROUND
WAS
WET
AND
THAT
THERE
WASNT
ANYONE
BEHIND
THE
BUILDING
WHEN
SHE
WENT
OUT
ON
THE
BALCONY
THERE
WAS
NO
ONE
THERE
THEY
WERE
ALL
STANDING
NEAR
THE
ENTRYWAY
THAT
BUILDING
WAS
ALSO
A
LUCKY
ONE
IN
THAT
THERE
WERE
NO
MURDERS
THERE
SHE
JUMPED
SHE
JUMPED
AND
DIDNT
FEEL
ANY
PAIN
IN
THE
HEAT
OF
THE
MOMENT
A
FEW
DAYS
LATER
I
FOUND
OUT
THAT
SHE
COULDNT
STAND
UP
SHE
HAD
BEEN
INJURED
SOMEHOW
THATS
HOW
PEOPLE
IN
SUMGAIT
SAVED
THEIR
LIVES
THEIR
HONOR
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
ANY
WAY
THEY
COULD
WHERE
IT
WAS
POSSIBLE
THE
ARMENIANS
FOUGHT
BACK
MY
FATHERS
FIRST
COUSIN
ARMEN
M
LIVES
IN
BLOCK
THEY
FOUND
OUT
BY
PHONE
FROM
ONE
OF
THE
VICTIMS
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
IN
TOWN
THE
ARMENIANS
IN
THAT
BUILDING
ALL
CALLED
ONE
ANOTHER
IMMEDIATELY
AND
ALL
OF
THEM
ARMED
THEMSELVES
WITH
AXES
KNIVES
EVEN
WITH
MUSKETS
AND
WENT
UP
TO
THE
ROOF
THEY
TOOK
THEIR
INFANTS
WITH
THEM
AND
THEIR
OLD
WOMEN
WHO
HAD
BEEN
IN
BED
FOR
GOD
KNOWS
HOW
MANY
MONTHS
THEY
GOT
THEM
RIGHT
OUT
OF
THEIR
BEDS
AND
TOOK
EVERYONE
UPSTAIRS
THEY
HOOKED
ELECTRICITY
UP
TO
THE
TRAP
DOOR
TO
THE
ROOF
AND
WAITED
READY
TO
FIGHT
THEN
THEY
TOOK
THE
DAUGHTER
OF
THE
SCHOOL
BOARD
DIRECTOR
HOSTAGE
SHES
AN
AZERBAIJANI
WHO
LIVED
IN
THEIR
BUILDING
THEY
CALLED
THE
SCHOOL
BOARD
DIRECTOR
AND
TOLD
HER
THAT
IF
SHE
DIDNT
HELP
THEM
THE
ARMENIANS
ON
THE
ROOF
TO
ESCAPE
ALIVE
AND
UNHARMED
SHED
NEVER
SEE
HER
DAUGHTER
AGAIN
IM
SURE
OF
COURSE
THAT
ARMENIANS
WOULD
NEVER
LAY
A
HAND
ON
A
WOMAN
IT
WAS
JUST
THE
ONLY
THING
THAT
COULD
HAVE
SAVED
THEM
AT
THE
TIME
SHE
CALLED
THE
POLICE
THE
ARMENIANS
MADE
A
DEAL
WITH
THE
LOCAL
POLICE
TO
GO
INTO
TOWN
TWO
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIERS
AND
SOLDIERS
WERE
SUMMONED
THEY
SURROUNDED
THE
ENTRYWAY
AND
LED
EVERYONE
DOWN
FROM
THE
ROOF
AND
OFF
TO
THE
SIDE
FROM
THE
ARMORED
PERSONNEL
CARRIERS
WAS
A
CROWD
THAT
WAS
ON
ITS
WAY
TO
THE
BUILDING
AT
THAT
VERY
MOMENT
INTO
BLOCK
THATS
HOW
THEY
DEFENDED
THEMSELVES
I
HEARD
THAT
OUR
NEIGHBORS
ROMAN
AND
SASHA
GAMBARIAN
RESISTED
THEYRE
BIG
STRONG
GUYS
THEIR
FATHER
WAS
KILLED
AND
I
HEARD
THAT
THE
BROTHERS
PUT
UP
A
STRONG
DEFENSE
AND
LOST
THEIR
FATHER
BUT
WERE
ABLE
TO
SAVE
THEIR
MOTHER
ONE
OF
THE
NEIGHBORS
TOLD
ME
THAT
AFTER
IT
HAPPENED
WHEN
THEY
WERE
LOOKING
FOR
THE
CRIMINALS
ON
MARCH
TO
AND
DETAINING
EVERYONE
THEY
SUSPECTED
PEOPLE
HID
PEOPLE
IN
OUR
ENTRYWAY
MAYBE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
INJURED
OR
PERHAPS
DEAD
THE
NEIGHBORS
THEMSELVES
WERE
AFRAID
TO
GO
THERE
AND
WHEN
THEY
WENT
WITH
THE
SOLDIERS
INTO
OUR
BASEMENT
THEY
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
FOUND
AZERBAIJANI
CORPSES
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
MANY
EVEN
IF
THEY
HAD
BEEN
WOUNDED
AND
PUT
DOWN
THERE
AFTER
TWO
DAYS
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
DIED
FROM
LOSS
OF
BLOOD
OR
INFECTIONTHAT
BASEMENT
WAS
FILLED
WITH
WATER
I
HEARD
THIS
FROM
THE
NEIGHBORS
AND
LATER
WHEN
I
WAS
TALKING
WITH
THE
INVESTIGATORS
THE
SUBJECT
CAME
UP
AND
THEY
CONFIRMED
IT
I
KNOW
TOO
THAT
FOR
SEVERAL
HOURS
THE
BASEMENT
WAS
USED
TO
STORE
OBJECTS
STOLEN
FROM
OUR
APARTMENT
AND
OUR
NEIGHBOR
CARRIED
OUT
OUR
CARPET
ALONG
WITH
THE
REST
HE
STOLE
IT
FOR
HIMSELF
POSING
AS
ONE
OF
THE
CRIMINALS
EVERYONE
WAS
TAKING
HIS
OWN
SHARE
AND
THE
NEIGHBOR
TOOK
HIS
TOO
AND
CARRIED
IT
HOME
AND
WHEN
WE
CAME
BACK
WHEN
EVERYTHING
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
CALMED
DOWN
HE
RETURNED
IT
SAYING
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
ONLY
THING
OF
OURS
HE
HAD
MANAGED
TO
SAVE
RAYAS
HUSBAND
AND
FATHER
DEFENDED
THEMSELVES
THE
TRDATOVS
DEFENDED
THEMSELVES
AND
SO
DID
OTHER
ARMENIAN
FAMILIES
TO
BE
SURE
THERE
WERE
AZERBAIJANI
VICTIMS
ALTHOUGH
WELL
NEVER
HEAR
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THEM
FOR
SOME
REASON
OUR
GOVERNMENT
DOESNT
WANT
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
WERE
NOT
JUST
VICTIMS
BUT
THAT
THEY
DEFENDED
THE
HONOR
OF
THEIR
SISTERS
AND
MOTHERS
TOO
IN
THE
TV
SHOW
POZITSIYA
VIEWPOINT
A
MILITARY
MAN
AN
OFFICER
SAID
THAT
THE
ARMENIANS
DID
VIRTUALLY
NOTHING
TO
DEFEND
THEMSELVES
BUT
THATS
NOT
IMPORTANT
THE
TRUTH
WILL
COME
OUT
REGARDLESS
SO
THATS
THE
PRICE
WE
PAID
THOSE
THREE
DAYS
FOR
THREE
DAYS
OUR
COURAGE
OUR
BRAVERY
AND
OUR
HUMANITY
WAS
TESTED
IT
WAS
THOSE
THREE
DAYS
AND
NOT
THE
YEARS
AND
DOZENS
OF
YEARS
WE
HAD
LIVED
BEFORE
THEM
THAT
SHOWED
WHAT
WEVE
BECOME
WHAT
WE
GREW
UP
TO
BE
THOSE
THREE
DAYS
SHOWED
WHO
WAS
WHO
ON
THAT
I
WILL
CONCLUDE
MY
NARRATIVE
ON
THE
SUMGAIT
TRAGEDY
IT
SHOULD
BE
SAID
THAT
ITS
NOT
OVER
YET
THE
TRIALS
ARE
STILL
AHEAD
OF
US
AND
THE
PUNISHMENTS
RECEIVED
BY
THOSE
WHO
SO
VIOLATED
US
WHO
WANTED
TO
MAKE
US
INTO
NONHUMANS
WILL
DEPEND
ON
OUR
POSITION
AND
ON
THE
WORK
OF
THE
INVESTIGATORS
THE
PROCURACY
AND
LITERALLY
OF
EVERY
PERSON
WHO
LENT
HIS
HAND
TO
THE
INVESTIGA
TION
THATS
THE
PRICE
WE
PAID
TO
LIVE
IN
ARMENIA
TO
NOT
FEAR
GOING
OUT
ON
THE
STREET
AT
NIGHT
TO
NOT
BE
AFRAID
TO
SAY
WERE

NOT
