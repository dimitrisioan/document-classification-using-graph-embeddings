ADAM
SHOSTACK
WRITES
TELL
ME
DO
THESE
YOUNG
MEN
ALSO
ATTACK
SYRIAN
TROOPS
IN
THE
SOUTH
LEBANON
AREA
ONLY
ISRAELI
AND
SLA
AND
LEBANESE
TROOPS
ARE
PRESENT
SYRIAN
TROOPS
ARE
DEPLOYED
NORTH
OF
THE
AWALI
RIVER
BETWEEN
THE
AWALI
RIVER
AND
THE
SECURITY
ZONE
ONLY
LEBANESE
TROOPS
ARE
STATIONED
WITH
THE
BLOOD
OF
ITS
SOLDIERS
IF
ISRAEL
IS
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
THAN
IT
SHOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
OUR
LAND
THERE
MUST
BE
A
GUARANTEE
OF
PEACE
BEFORE
THIS
HAPPENS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MANY
OF
THESE
LEBANESE
YOUTH
ARE
UNABLE
TO
RESTRAIN
THEMSELVES
FROM
VIOLENCE
AND
UNABLE
TO
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THEIR
ACTIONS
PROLONG
ISRAELS
STAY
IN
SOUTH
LEBANON
THAT
IS
YOUR
OPINION
AND
THE
OPINION
OF
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
I
AGREE
PEACE
GUARANTEES
WOULD
BE
BETTER
FOR
ALL
BUT
I
AM
ADDRESSING
THE
PROBLEM
AS
IT
STANDS
NOW
HOPEFULLY
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PEACE
SETTLEMENT
WILL
BE
CONCLUDED
SOON
AND
WILL
INCLUDE
SECURITY
GUARANTEES
FOR
BOTH
SIDES
MY
PROPOSAL
WAS
AIMED
AT
DECREASING
THE
CASUALTIES
IN
THE
INTERIM
PERIOD
IN
MY
OPINION
IF
ISRAEL
WITHDRAWS
UNILATERALLY
IT
WOULD
STILL
BE
BETTER
OFF
THAN
STAYING
THE
ISRAELI
GOVT
OBVIOUSLY
AGREES
WITH
YOU
AND
IS
NOT
WILLING
TO
DO
SUCH
A
MOVE
I
HOPE
TO
BE
BE
ABLE
TO
CHANGE
YOUR
OPINION
AND
THEIRS
THATS
WHY
I
POST
TO
TPM
IF
THE
LEBANESE
ARMY
WAS
ABLE
TO
MAINTAIN
THE
PEACE
THEN
ISRAEL
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
TO
BE
THERE
UNTIL
IT
IS
ISRAEL
PREFERS
THAT
ITS
SOLDIERS
DIE
RATHER
THAN
ITS
CHILDREN
AS
I
EXPLAINED
I
CONTEND
THAT
IF
ISRAEL
DOES
WITHDRAW
UNILATERALLY
I
BELIEVE
NO
ATTACKS
WOULD
ENSUE
AGAINST
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
I
ALSO
EXPLAINED
WHY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
TO
BE
THE
CASE
MY
SUGGESTION
IS
AIMED
AT
REDUCING
THE
LEVEL
OF
TENSION
AND
CASUALTIES
ON
ALL
SIDES
IT
IS
UNFORTUNATE
THAT
ISRAEL
DOES
NOT
AGREE
WITH
MY
OPINION
IF
ISRAEL
REALLY
WANTS
TO
SAVE
SOME
ISRAELI
LIVES
IT
WOULD
WITHDRAW
UNILATERALLY
FROM
THE
SOCALLED
SECURITY
ZONE
BEFORE
THE
CONCLUSION
OF
THE
PEACE
TALKS
SUCH
A
MOVE
WOULD
SAVE
ISRAELI
LIVES
ADVANCE
PEACE
EFFORTS
GIVE
ISRAEL
A
GREAT
MORAL
LIFT
BETTER
ISRAELS
PUBLIC
IMAGE
ABROAD
AND
GIVE
IT
AN
EDGE
IN
THE
PEACE
NEGOCIATIONS
SINCE
ISRAEL
CAN
RIGHTLY
CLAIM
THAT
IT
IS
GENUINELY
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
AND
HAS
ALREADY
OFFERED
SOME
IMPORTANT
CONCESSIONS
ISRAEL
SHOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
LEBANON
WHEN
A
PEACE
TREATY
IS
SIGNED
NOT
A
DAY
BEFORE
WITHDRAW
BECAUSE
OF
CASUALTIES
WOULD
TELL
THE
LEBANESE
PEOPLE
THAT
ALL
THEY
NEED
TO
DO
TO
PUSH
ISRAEL
AROUND
IS
KILL
A
FEW
SOLDIERS
ITS
NOT
GONNA
HAPPEN
THAT
IS
TOO
BAD
ALONG
WITH
SUCH
A
WITHDRAWAL
ISRAEL
COULD
DEMAND
THAT
HIZBOLLAH
BE
DISARMED
BY
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
AND
WARN
THAT
IT
WILL
NOT
ACCEPT
ANY
ATTACKS
AGAINST
ITS
NORTHERN
CITIES
AND
THAT
IF
SUCH
A
SHELLING
OCCURS
THAN
IT
WILL
CONSIDER
RETAKING
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
AND
WILL
HOLD
THE
LEBANESE
AND
SYRIAN
GOVERNMENT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
IT
WHY
SHOULD
ISRAEL
NOT
DEMAND
THIS
WHILE
HOLDING
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
BETTER
BARGAINING
POSITION
IS
WHILE
HOLDING
YOUR
NEIGHBORS
LAND
BECAUSE
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
OCCUPYING
THE
SECURITY
ZONE
FREE
OF
CHARGE
IT
IS
PAYING
THE
PRICE
FOR
THAT
ONCE
ISRAEL
WITHDRAWS
IT
MAY
HAVE
LOST
A
BARGAINING
CHIP
AT
THE
NEGOCIATING
TABLE
BUT
IT
WOULD
SAVE
SOME
SOLDIERS
LIVES
THAT
IS
MY
CONTENTION
IF
LEBANON
WERE
WILLING
TO
AGREE
TO
THOSE
CONDITIONS
ISRAEL
WOULD
QUITE
PROBABLY
HAVE
LEFT
ALREADY
UNFORTUNATELY
IT
DOESNT
SEEM
THAT
THE
LEBANESE
CAN
DISARM
THE
HIZBOLAH
AND
MAINTAIN
THE
PEACE
THAT
IS
COMPLETELY
UNTRUE
HIZBOLLAH
IS
NOW
A
MINOR
FORCE
IN
LEBANESE
POLITICS
THE
REAL
HEAVY
WEIGHTS
ARE
SYRIAS
ALLIES
THE
GOVT
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
SYRIA
THE
LEBANESE
ARMY
IS
OVER
TROOPS
AND
UNIFIED
LIKE
NEVER
BEFORE
HIZBOLLAH
CAN
HAVE
NO
MORAL
JUSTIFICATION
IN
ATTACKING
ISRAEL
PROPER
ESPECIALLY
AFTER
ISRAELI
WITHDRAWAL
THAT
WOULD
DRAW
THE
IRE
OF
THE
LEBANESE
THE
SYRIAN
AND
THE
ISRAELI
GOVTS
IF
ISRAEL
DOES
WITHDRAW
AND
SUCH
AN
ACT
HIZBOLLLAH
ATTACKING
ISRAEL
WOULD
BE
AKIN
TO
POLITICAL
AND
MORAL
SUICIDE
