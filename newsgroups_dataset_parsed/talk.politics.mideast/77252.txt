RE
EUROPE
VS
MUSLIM
BOSNIANS
MY
RECOLLECTION
OF
HISTORYDOCUMENTARY
BOOKS
IS
SLITELY
DIFFERENT
IT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
CROATS
WERE
ALLIES
OF
GERMANY
DURING
WWII
WHILE
SERBS
HAD
SIDED
WITH
RUSSIA
AS
A
RESULT
SERBS
DID
TAKE
A
BEATING
FROM
CROATS
NOT
BOSNIAN
MOSLEMS
WHILE
GERMANY
HAD
THE
UPPER
HAND
EVEN
TODAY
RUSSIANS
CONSIDERCALL
SERBS
AS
THEIR
SLOVAC
BROTHERS
THIS
IS
ONE
OF
THE
ISSUES
INVOLVED
IN
THE
UNS
LACK
OF
ACTIVE
INTERVENTION
AGAINST
SERBS
AS
FOR
THE
BOSNIAN
MOSLEMS
I
HAVE
NOT
HEARD
OF
ANY
ALLIANCE
WITH
GERMANY
OR
RUSSIA
IN
RECENT
HISTORY
THEREFORE
I
AM
CURIOUS
IF
THEY
DID
OR
WERE
ABLE
TO
TREAT
OTHER
PARTIES
IN
THIS
CONFLICT
WITH
SAME
BRUTALLITY
AS
THEY
ARE
GETTING
IT
TODAY
IN
THE
PAST
HISTORY
REGARDS

MOSHIRI
