IN

WRITES
IT
IS
NOT
A
TERRORIST
CAMP
AS
YOU
AND
THE
ISRAELIS
LIKE
TO
VIEW
THE
VILLAGES
THEY
ARE
SMALL
COMMUNITIES
WITH
KIDS
PLAYING
SOCCER
IN
THE
STREETS
WOMEN
PREPARING
LUNCH
MEN
PLAYING
CARDS
ETC
SOME
YOUNG
MEN
USUALLY
AGED
BETWEEN
TO
YEARS
ARE
MEMBERS
OF
THE
LEBANESE
RESISTANCE
EVEN
THE
INHABITANTS
OF
THE
VILLAGE
DO
NOT
KNOW
WHO
THESE
ARE
THEY
ARE
SECRETIVE
ABOUT
IT
BUT
MOST
PEOPLE
OFTEN
SUSPECT
WHO
THEY
ARE
AND
WHAT
THEY
ARE
UP
TO
THESE
YOUNG
MEN
ARE
SUPPORTED
FINANCIALLY
BY
IRAN
MOST
OF
THE
TIME
THEY
SNEAK
ARMS
AND
AMMUNITIONS
INTO
THE
OCCUPIED
ZONE
WHERE
THEY
SET
UP
BOOBY
TRAPS
FOR
ISRAELI
PATROLS
EVERY
TIME
AN
ISRAELI
SOLDIER
IS
KILLED
OR
INJURED
BY
THESE
TRAPS
ISRAEL
RETALLIATES
BY
INDISCRIMINATELY
BOMBING
VILLAGES
OF
THEIR
OWN
CHOOSING
OFTEN
KILLING
ONLY
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
THIS
A
TRIED
AND
TRUE
METHOD
UTILIZED
BY
GUERILLA
AND
TERRORISTS
GROUPS
TO
CONDUCT
OPERATIONS
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THE
LOCAL
POPULACE
THUS
FORCING
THE
OPPOSING
STATE
TO
POSSIBLE
HARM
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
IN
THEIR
SEARCH
OR
IN
ORDER
TO
AVOID
THE
DEATHS
OF
CIVILIANS
ABANDON
THE
SEARCH
CERTAINLY
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ARE
ALSO
TO
BLAIM
FOR
DRAGGING
THE
INNOCENT
CIVILIANS
INTO
HARMS
WAY
ARE
YOU
SUGGESTING
THAT
WHEN
GUERILLAS
USE
THE
POPULATION
FOR
COVER
ISRAEL
SHOULD
TOTALLY
BACK
DOWN
SOTHE
EASIEST
WAY
TO
GET
AWAY
WITH
ATTACKING
ANOTHER
IS
TO
USE
AN
INNOCENT
AS
A
SHIELD
AND
HOPE
THAT
THE
OTHER
RESPECTS
INNOCENT
LIVES
TELL
ME
TIM
WHAT
ARE
THESE
GUERILLAS
DOING
WRONG
ASSUMING
THAT
THEY
ARE
USING
CIVILIANS
FOR
COVER
ARE
THEY
NOT
KILLING
SOLDIERS
IN
THEIR
COUNTRY
IF
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
IS
TO
PREVENT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
IS
IT
NOT
WORKING
WHY
IS
IT
FURTHER
NECCESSARY
FOR
ISRAELI
GUNS
TO
POUND
LEBANESE
VILLAGES
WHY
NOT
JUST
KILL
THOSE
WHO
TRY
TO
INFILTRATE
THE
BUFFER
ZONE
YOU
SEE
THERE
IS
MORE
TO
THE
SHELLING
OF
THE
VILLAGES
IT
IS
CALLED
RETALIATION
GETTING
BACK
GETTING
EVEN
IT
DOESNT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
SHELL
THE
VILLAGES
THE
LEAST
IT
SHOWS
IS
A
RECKLESS
DISREGARD
BY
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
FOR
THE
LIVES
OF
CIVILIANS
IF
ISRAEL
INSISTS
THAT
THE
SO
CALLED
SECURITY
ZONE
IS
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
PROTECTION
OF
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
THAN
IT
WILL
HAVE
TO
PAY
THE
PRICE
OF
ITS
OCCUPATION
WITH
THE
BLOOD
OF
ITS
SOLDIERS
IF
ISRAEL
IS
INTERESTED
IN
PEACE
THAN
IT
SHOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
OUR
LAND
WHAT
SO
THE
WHOLE
BIT
ABOUT
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
NEIGHBORING
ARAB
STATES
CAN
START
ALL
OVER
AGAIN
WHILE
I
ALSO
HOPE
FOR
THIS
TO
HAPPEN
IT
WILL
ONLY
OCCUR
WHEN
ARAB
STATES
SHOW
THAT
THEY
ARE
PREPARED
TO
TAKE
ON
THE
RESPONSIBILITY
AND
THE
DUTY
TO
STOP
GUERILLA
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAEL
FROM
THEIR
SOIL
THEY
HAVE
TO
PROVE
IT
OR
PROVIDE
SOME
GUARATEES
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
ISRAEL
IS
GOING
TO
ACCEPT
THEIR
WORD
NOT
WITH
THEIR
PAST
ATTITUDE
OF
TOLERANCE
TOWARDS
ANTIISRAEL
GUERILLAS
INRESIDENCE
IF
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
THE
WORD
OF
OTHERS
THEN
IMHO
IT
HAS
NO
BUSINESS
WASTING
OTHERS
TIME
COMING
TO
THE
PEACE
TALKS
I
HAVE
WRITTEN
BEFORE
ON
THIS
VERY
NEWSGROUP
THAT
THE
ONLY
REAL
SOLUTION
WILL
COME
AS
A
RESULT
OF
A
COMPREHENSIVE
PEACE
SETTLEMENT
WHEREBY
ISRAEL
WITHDRAWS
TO
ITS
OWN
BORDERS
AND
PEACE
KEEPING
TROOPS
ARE
STATIONED
ALONG
THE
BORDER
TO
INSURE
NO
ONE
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
BORDER
IS
SHELLED
GOOD
LORD
BRAD
NO
I
AM
NOT
BASIL
I
THINK
BASIL
IS
A
VERY
INTELLIGENT
PERSON
AND
I
RESPECT
WHAT
HE
WRITES
BASIL
IS
A
PERSON
THAT
I
WOULD
GLADLY
CALL
A
FRIEND
HE
IS
HOWEVER
NOT
ME
NOR
AM
I
LEBANESE
AS
SOME
SEEM
TO
SUSPECT
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
REALISTIC
SOLUTION
IT
IS
TIME
FOR
ISRAEL
TO
REALIZE
THAT
THE
CONCEPT
OF
A
BUFFER
ZONE
AIMED
AT
PROTECTING
ITS
NORTHERN
CITIES
HAS
FAILED
IN
FACT
IT
HAS
CAUSED
MUCH
MORE
ISRAELI
DEATHS
THAN
THE
OCCASIONAL
SHELLING
OF
NORTHERN
ISRAEL
WOULD
HAVE
RESULTED
IN
PERHAPS
YOU
ARE
AWARE
THAT
TO
MOST
COMMUNITIES
OF
PEOPLE
THERE
IS
THE
FEELING
THAT
IT
IS
BETTER
THAT
MANY
OF
US
DIE
FIGHTING
AGAINST
THOSE
WHO
ATTACK
US
THAN
FOR
FEW
TO
DIE
WHILE
WE
SILENTLY
ACCEPT
OUR
FATE
IFHOWEVER
YOU
CALL
ON
ISRAEL
TO
SEE
THE
SENSE
OF
SUFFERING
FEWER
CASUALTIES
I
SUGGEST
YOU
APPLY
THE
SAME
TO
PALESTINIAN
ARAB
AND
ISLAMIC
GROUPS
TIM
YOU
ARE
IGNORING
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PALESTINIANS
IN
LEBANON
HAVE
BEEN
DISARMED
HEZBOLLAH
REMAINS
THE
ONLY
INDEPENDENT
MILITIA
HEZBOLLAH
DOES
NOT
ATTACK
ISRAEL
EXCEPT
AT
A
FEW
TIMES
SUCH
AS
WHEN
THE
IDF
BURNED
UP
SHEIKH
MOSAVI
HIS
WIFE
AND
YOUNG
SON
OF
COURSE
IF
ISRAEL
WOULD
WITHDRAW
FROM
LEBANON
AND
STOP
ASSASSINATING
PEOPLE
AND
SHELLING
VILLAGES
THEY
WOULDNT
MAKE
THE
LEBANESE
SO
MAD
AS
TO
DO
THAT
FURTHERMORE
WITH
HEZBOLLAH
SUBSEQUENTLY
DISARMED
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
POSSIBLE
AND
NOW
THE
LEBANESE
GOVERNMENT
HAS
PROVEN
THAT
IT
IS
CAPABLE
OF
CONTROLLING
AND
DISARMING
ALL
MILITIAS
AS
THEY
DID
IN
ALL
OTHER
PARTS
OF
LEBANON
BASIL
IT
HAS
NOT
WITHOUT
THE
SUPPORT
AND
ACTIVE
INVOLVEMENT
OF
SYRIA
LEBANON
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ACCOMPLISH
ALL
THAT
HAS
OCCURRED
ONCE
SYRIA
LEAVES
WHO
IS
TO
SAY
THAT
LEBANON
WILL
BE
ABLE
TO
RETAIN
CONTROL
IF
SYRIA
STAYS
THAY
MAY
BE
EVEN
MORE
DANGEROUS
FOR
ISRAEL
TIM
WHEN
IS
THE
LAST
TIME
THAT
YOU
RECALL
ANY
TROUBLE
ON
THE
SYRIAN
BORDER
NOT
LATELY
EH
ISRAEL
KNOWS
VERY
WELL
THAT
THE
SYRIANS
ARE
ABLE
TO
RESTRAIN
ALL
WHO
WOULD
USE
TERRITORY
UNDER
THEIR
CONTROL
TO
ATTACK
ISRAEL
WHILE
LEBANON
WOULD
BE
BETTER
OFF
WITH
SYRIA
AND
ISRAEL
OUT
OF
ITS
BORDERS
THE
PRESENCE
OF
SYRIAN
TROOPS
IN
LEBANON
HAS
MEANT
A
SHARP
DECREASE
IN
ATTACKS
ON
ISRAELI
TERRITORY
NOT
ON
ISRAELI
TROOPS
IN
LEBANON
HOWEVER
PLEASE
NOTE
THE
DISTINCTION
IN
THE
PAST
TWO
YEARS
TIM
YOUR
VIEW
OF
THIS
ENTIRE
MATTER
IS
FAR
TOO
SERENELY
ONESIDED
AND
SELECTIVELY
NAIVE
I
DISAGREE
BASIL
HAS
ALWAYS
SEEMED
TO
ME
TO
BE
A
COOLHEADED
PERSON
SLOW
TO
ANGER
CERTAINLY
MORE
SO
THAN
I
WHAT
IS
MOST
IMPORTANT
IS
THAT
HE
IS
AN
ACTUAL
WITNESS
TO
THINGS
FROM
THE
OTHER
END
OF
THE
ISRAELI
GUNS
IF
ONLY
THE
ISRAELI
GOVERNMENT
WOULD
REMEMBER
WHAT
IT
WAS
LIKE
WHEN
THE
ROLES
WERE
REVERSED
PERHAPS
THEY
WOULD
MODERATE
THEIR
RETALIATION
