THE

SON
OF

THE

ACCOMPANIED

SAYS
PELLY
WHEN

SABAH
HIMSELF

THIS
DESCRIPTION

THAT
TO
A

IT
WAS
RUN
ACCORDING

OF

AND

WERE
THE

PATRIARCHAL

SHEIKH

THE

SHEIKH

HE
CALLED

SAID
I

I

THROUGHOUT

THE

HAD
ALWAYS
REGARDED
SHEIKH
JABIR
AS
A
GOOD
FRIEND
BUT
IN
OCTOBER
AN
EVENT
TOOK
PLACE
AT
KUWAIT
WHICH

ON
OCTOBER
LIEUTENANT
EDMUNDS
THE
ASSISTANT
RESIDENT
AT
ABU
SHAHR
IN
IRAN
ARRIVED
IN
KUWAIT
ON
A
SPECIAL
MISSION
FROM
THE
RESIDENT
CAPTAIN
HENNELL
HIS
MISSION
WAS
TO
FIND
OUT
IF
KUWAIT
WAS
WILLING

ESTABLISHMENT
OF
A
BRITISH

OF
THE

AFTER
IT
HAD
ANCHORED
IN

BAY
THE
SALUTE
WAS
NOT
ACKNOWLEDGED
AND
EDMUNDS
WAITED
IN
THE
VESSEL
FOR
THREE
DAYS
BEFORE
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
COMMUNICATE
WITH
THE
SHEIKH
AFTER
EDMUNDS
RETURN
TO
ABU
SHAHR
BOTH
HE
AND
CAPTAIN
HENNELL
EXPLAINED
THIS
UNUSUAL
BEHAVIOR
OF
THE
SHEIKH
TO
HAVE
BEEN
DUE
NOT
TO
ILLWILL
BUT
PRINCIPALLY
TO
A
DESIRE
TO
MISLEAD
THE
EGYPTIAN
AGENT
AT
KUWAIT
AS
TO
THE
NATURE
OF
HIS
RELATIONS
WITH
THE
BRITISH
THEREFORE
THEY
CONSIDERED
THAT
JABIRS
CONDUCT
DID
NOT
INDICATE
ANY
CHANGE
IN
HIS
FRIENDLY
POLICIES
TOWARDS
THE
BRITISH
IF
THE
BRITISH
TOLERATED
THE
ATTITUDE
OF
JABIR
TOWARDS
EDMUNDS
SO
ALSO
DID
THE
EGYPTIANS
EARLIER
IN

YEAR

WANTED

POLICY
THAT
HAD
BEEN
ADOPTED
EARLIER
BY

ABDULLA
IBN
SABAH
THIS
CAN
THEREFORE
BE
LOOKED
UPON
AS
AN
INDICATION
OF
SELFCONFIDENCE
AN
OUTCOME
OF
KUWAITS
INDEPENDENCE
FROM
FOREIGN
POWERS
IT
CORROBORATES
THE
FACT
THAT
KUWAIT
IF
NECESSARY
WAS
PREPARED
TO
DEFEND
ITSELF
AGAINST
MORE
POWERFUL
NEIGHBORS
THIS
DEFENSE
DEPENDED
NOT

ON
THE
