as
armenians
celebrating
the
genocide
of
million
muslim
people
in
article
system
operator
writes
or
as
we
have
painfully
witnessed
in
azerbaijan
would
like
to
see
it
happen
again
is
this
the
joke
of
the
month
your
fascist
grandparents
exterminated
million
muslim
people
between
and
your
nazi
parents
fully
participated
in
the
extermination
of
the
european
jewry
during
wwii
your
criminal
cousins
have
been
slaughtering
muslim
women
children
and
elderly
people
in
fascist
xsoviet
armenia
and
karabag
for
the
last
four
years
the
entire
population
of
xsoviet
armenia
now
as
a
result
of
the
genocide
of
million
muslim
people
are
armenians
for
nearly
one
thousand
years
the
turkish
and
kurdish
people
lived
on
their
homeland
the
last
one
hundred
under
the
oppressive
soviet
and
armenian
occupation
the
persecutions
culminated
in
the
armenian
government
planned
and
carried
out
a
genocide
against
its
muslim
subjects
million
turks
and
kurds
were
murdered
and
the
remainder
driven
out
of
their
homeland
after
one
thousand
years
turkish
and
kurdish
lands
were
empty
of
turks
and
kurds
the
survivors
found
a
safe
heaven
in
turkiye
today
xsoviet
armenian
government
rejects
the
right
of
turks
and
kurds
to
return
to
their
muslim
lands
occupied
by
xsoviet
armenia
today
xsoviet
armenian
government
covers
up
the
genocide
perpetrated
by
its
predecessors
and
is
therefore
an
accessory
to
this
crime
against
humanity
xsoviet
armenian
government
must
pay
for
their
crime
of
genocide
against
the
muslims
by
admitting
to
the
crime
and
making
reparations
to
the
turks
and
kurds
turks
and
kurds
demand
the
right
to
return
to
their
lands
to
determine
their
own
future
as
a
nation
in
their
own
homeland
during
the
anniversary
we
come
once
again
reiterate
the
unity
of
the
muslim
people
the
timelessness
of
the
turkish
and
kurdish
demands
and
the
desire
to
pursue
the
struggle
for
that
restitution
a
struggle
that
unites
all
turks
and
kurds
today
we
appeal
to
all
turkish
and
kurdish
people
in
the
united
states
and
canada
to
participate
en
masse
in
the
commemorative
events
be
they
cultural
political
or
religious
serdar
argic
we
closed
the
roads
and
mountain
passes
that
might
serve
as
ways
of
escape
for
the
turks
and
then
proceeded
in
the
work
of
extermination
ohanus
appressian
in
soviet
armenia
today
there
no
longer
exists
a
single
turkish
soul
