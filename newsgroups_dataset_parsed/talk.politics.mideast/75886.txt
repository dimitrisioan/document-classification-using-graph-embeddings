DOESNOT

AGE
MAY
BE
OFFDUTY
MILITARY
ALL
BUT
YOUNG

ARE
ACCEPTABLE
TARGETS
SINCE
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ISRAEL
CONSTITUTES
INDICATION
OF
HOSTILE
INTENT
NO
FURTHER
PROVOCATION
IS
REQUIRED
TO
AVOID
INPERMISSABLE
VIOLATIONS
OF
THE

ISRAELI

PALESTINEANS
WITHOUT

CLEAR
INDICATION
OF
AGGRESSIVE

A

THREE
ROUNDS
OF

TEN
SECONDS
BETWEEN

FOR

BY
THE
POSESSION
OF
UNIQUELY
