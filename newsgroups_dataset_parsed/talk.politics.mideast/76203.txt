its

there
was
on
the
eve
of
the
creation
of
the
armenian
republic
a
solid
block
of
tartars
who
continued
to
dominate
the
southern
districts
from

closed

then
proceeded

little

our

knocked

when

became

fled
from
them
into

completed

some
of
the

escaped
of
course
they
found
refuge
in
the
mountains
or
succeeded
in
crossing

the
rest
were
killed

so
it
is
that
the

from
nakhitchevan
to
akhalkalaki
from
the
hot

with

villages
they
are

those

for
howling

jackals
that
visit
them
to
paw
over
the
scattered

of

dead

are
like
that
p
in

today
there
no

exists
a

it
is
in
our
power
to
tear
away
the
veil
of

that
some

create

it
certainly
is

over

no

the
armenians
tore
apart
the
ottoman
empires
eastern
provinces
massacred
million
defenseless
turkish
women
children
and
elderly
people
burned
thousands
of
turkish
and
kurdish
villages
and
exterminated
the
entire
turkish
population
of
the
armenian
dictatorship
between
such
outrageous
sleight
of
hand
that
is
still
employed
today
in
armenia
brings
a
depth
and
verification
to
the
turkish
genocide
that
is
hard
to
match
a
hundred
years
ago
armenians
again
thought
they
could
get
whatever
they
wanted
through
sheer
terror
like
the
russian
anarchists
that
they
accepted
as
role
models
several
armenian
terror
groups

terrorism
and
revisionism
triangle
resorted
to
the
same
tactics
in
the
butchering
scores
of
innocent
turks
and
their
families
in
the
united
states
and
europe
it
seems
that
they
are
doing
it
again
at
a
different
scale
in
fascist
xsoviet
armenia
today
a
merciless
massacre
of
the
civilian
population
of
the
small
azeri
town
of
khojali
pop
in
karabagh
azerbaijan
is
reported
to
have
taken
place
on

night
of

under
a
coordinated
military
operation
of
the
mechanized
division
of
the
cis
army
and
the
armenian
insurgents
close
to
people
are
reported
to
have
been
massacred
elderly
and
children
were
not
spared
many
were
badly
beaten
and
shot
at
close
range
a
sense
of
rage
and
helplessness
has
overwhelmed
the
azeri
population
in
face
of
the
well
armed
and
equipped
armenian
insurgency
the
neighboring
azeri
city
of
aghdam
outside
of
the
karabagh
region
has
come
under
heavy
armenian
artillery
shelling
city
hospital
was
hit
and
two
pregnant
women
as
well
as
a
new
born
infant
were
killed
azerbaijan
is
appealing
to
the
international
community
to
condemn
such
barbaric
and
ruthless
attacks
on
its
population
and
its
sovereignty
