muslim
in
exyugoslavia
was
a
nation
not
a
religion
in
fact
not
all
muslims
in
bh
are
followers
of
islam
therefore
there
do
did
exist
in
exyugoslavia
christian
muslims
yeah
thats
it
youve
really
outdone
yourself
this
time
nick
dont
forget
the
davidian
muslims
islam
is
not
a
race
its
a
religion
you
can
be
white
black
fijian
or
alaskan
i
guess
you
didnt
absorb
too
much
of
the
malcolm
x
interest
circulating
you
see
the
whole
point
of
islam
is
that
it
stresses
equality
amongst
all
peoples
now
i
do
realize
this
is
difficult
for
you
to
comprehend
given
your
staunch
beliefs
in
serbian
ethnic
cleansing
but
give
it
a
try
its
really
not
that
difficult
our
white
knight
for
islam
rides
in
again
our
instant
expert
on
religion
race
and
ethnicity
is
at
the
door
stand
back
all
let
him
through
hes
going
to
singlehandedly
rescue
islam
from
all
these
dastardly
mistakes
misquotes
misconceptions
the
war
is
not
a
religious
war
and
it
is
not
an
ethnic
war
thats
right
its
a
disneyland
war
all
a
setup
for
the
tv
cameras
there
are
also
people
who
believe
man
never
landed
on
the
moon
that
the
whole
apollo
story
was
done
in
tv
studios
it
is
a
civil
war
in
which
the
terms
of
secession
are
being
negotiated
with
guns
instead
of
pens
the
croat
muslim
and
serb
political
leaders
all
chose
to
fight
over
the
terms
of
secession
instead
of
compromising
and
peacefully
negotiating
multilateral
secession
agreements
terms
of
secession
you
are
of
course
joking
right
nick
nobody
chose
to
fight
bosnia
and
croatia
were
internationally
recognized
nations
when
the
serbs
attacked
and
started
on
their
welldocumented
genocide
that
makes
them
an
outside
aggressor
its
a
simple
genocide
a
classical
example
of
ethnic
cleansing
there
is
no
question
of
civil
war
shakil
did
it
occur
to
you
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
bosnian
serbs
who
arent
necessarily
outsiders
and
while
youre
at
it
could
you
please
pontificate
a
little
bit
about
your
islamic
pals
in
the
sudan
who
are
running
amuck
in
the
south
kidnapping
women
and
children
and
in
essence
doing
the
same
thing
how
come
we
dont
hear
your
wonderful
treatises
on
whats
happening
out
there
