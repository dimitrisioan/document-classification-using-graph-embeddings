re
rejoinder
questions
to
israelis
in
a
previous
article
cprigcapcorg
center
for
policy
research
says
today
finally
if
israel
wants
peace
why
cant
it
declare
what
it
considers
its
legitimate
and
secure
borders
which
might
be
a
base
for
negotiations
having
all
the
above
facts
in
mind
one
cannot
blame
arab
countries
to
fear
israeli
expansionism
as
a
number
of
wars
have
proved
oh
yeah
israel
was
really
ready
to
expand
its
borders
on
the
holiest
day
of
the
year
yom
kippur
when
the
arabs
attacked
in
oh
wait
you
chose
to
omit
that
warperhaps
because
it
supports
the
exact
opposite
to
the
point
you
are
trying
to
make
i
dont
think
that
its
because
it
was
the
war
that
hit
israel
the
hardest
also
in
it
was
egypt
not
israel
who
kicked
out
the
un
force
in
it
was
the
arabs
who
refused
to
accept
the
existance
of
israel
based
on
the
borders
set
by
the
united
nations
in
egypt
closed
off
the
red
sea
to
israeli
shipping
a
clear
antagonistic
act
and
in
the
attack
was
a
response
to
years
of
constant
shelling
by
terrorist
organizations
from
the
golan
heights
children
were
being
murdered
all
the
time
by
terrorists
and
israel
finally
retaliated
nowhere
do
i
see
a
war
that
israel
started
so
that
the
borders
could
be
expanded
