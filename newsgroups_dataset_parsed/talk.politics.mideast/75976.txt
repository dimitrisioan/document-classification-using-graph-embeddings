MOHAMMAD
RAZI
KHAN
WRITES
ONE
OF
MY
BIGGEST
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
USING
THE
WORD
FUNDAMENTALIST
IS
THAT
AT
LEAST
IN
THE
USA
PEOPLE
SPEAK
OF
MUSLIME
FUNDAMENTALISTS
MUSLIM
BUT
NOBODY
DEFINES
WHAT
A
JEWISH
OR
CHRISTAN
FUNDAMENTALIST
IS
I
WONDER
WHAT
AN
EQUAL
DEFINITION
WOULD
BE
ANY
TAKERS
THE
AMERICAN
PRESS
ROUTINELY
USES
THE
WORD
FUNDAMENTALIST
TO
REFER
TO
BOTH
CHRISTIANS
AND
JEWS
CHRISTIAN
FUNDEMENTALISTS
ARE
OFTEN
REFERED
TO
IN
THE
CONTEXT
OF
ANTIABORTION
PROTESTS
THE
AMERICAN
MEDIA
ALSO
USES
FUNDAMENTALIST
TO
REFER
TO
JEWS
WHO
LIVE
IN
JUDEA
SAMARIA
OR
GAZA
AND
TO
ANY
JEW
WHO
FOLLOWS
