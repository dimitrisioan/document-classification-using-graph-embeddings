btw
with
bosnias
large
moslem
population
why
have
nations
like
turkey
saudi
arabia
syria
egypt
and
others
with
either
money
or
strong
military
forces
not
spoken
out
more
forcibly
or
offered
to
help
out
bosnia
obviously
you
really
dont
know
they
have
spoken
out
cf
secy
of
state
christophers
recent
trip
to
the
me
they
have
provided
millions
in
aid
and
they
have
participated
in
the
airlifts
to
sarajevo
they
would
supply
military
aid
if
the
un
would
lift
the
embargo
on
arms
sales
the
turkish
ambassador
has
ocassionally
said
a
thing
or
two
but
thats
all
i
see
no
great
enthusism
from
any
of
those
places
to
get
their
hands
dirty
why
does
the
us
always
get
stuck
with
this
stuff
see
above
kuwait
has
directly
participated
in
the
airlift
of
food
to
sarajevo
besides
theres
no
case
that
can
be
made
for
us
military
involvement
there
that
doesnt
apply
equally
well
to
say
liberia
angola
or
it
appears
with
the
khmer
rouges
new
campaign
cambodia
nonwhites
dont
count
hmmsome
might
say
kuwaitis
are
nonwhite
ooops
i
forgot
kuwaitis
are
oil
rich
loaded
with
petrodollars
etc
so
they
dont
count
