the
readers
of
this
forum
seemed
to
be
more
interested
in
the
contents
of
those
files
so
it
will
be
nice
if
yigal
will
tell
us
why
do
american
authorities
consider
yigal
arens
to
be
dangerous
adl
authorities
seem
to
view
a
lot
of
people
as
dangerous
including
the
millions
of
americans
of
arab
ancestry
perhaps
you
can
answer
the
question
as
to
why
the
adl
maintained
files
and
spied
on
adc
members
in
california
and
elsewhere
friendly
rivalry
perhaps
come
on
most
if
not
all
arabs
are
sympathetic
to
the
palestinian
war
against
israel
that
is
why
the
adl
monitors
arab
organizations
that
is
the
same
reason
the
us
monitored
communist
organizations
and
soviet
nationals
only
a
few
years
ago
the
adc
is
an
organization
of
arabamericans
let
me
seeyoure
saying
that
most
if
not
all
arabamericans
should
be
spied
on
youre
also
saying
that
most
if
not
all
arabamericans
should
be
views
as
a
national
security
threat
to
israel
and
the
us
as
you
gratuitously
imply
in
your
reference
to
the
wtc
bombing
in
which
no
arabamericans
were
involved
by
inference
can
we
assume
that
you
think
that
anyone
of
arab
lineage
anywhere
in
the
world
poses
a
threat
to
israel
and
therefore
should
be
spied
on
perhaps
then
on
the
basis
of
pollard
spy
case
not
to
mention
the
rosenbergs
etc
you
think
that
all
jewish
americans
should
be
spied
on
by
the
adc
oh
never
mind
this
whole
spying
case
has
obviously
so
convoluted
your
sense
of
right
or
wrong
in
these
matters
that
i
have
no
wish
confuse
you
further
perhaps
yigal
is
a
greenpeace
member
or
the
naacp
or
a
reporter
or
a
member
of
any
of
the
dozens
of
other
political
organizationsethnic
minoritiesoccupations
that
the
adl
spied
on
all
of
these
groups
have
in
the
past
associated
with
or
been
a
part
of
anti
israel
activity
or
propoganda
the
adl
is
simply
monitoring
them
so
that
if
anything
comes
up
they
wont
be
caught
by
surprise
so
the
la
times
reporter
who
had
information
about
him
sold
to
the
south
african
government
was
involved
in
antiisrael
activity
or
propaganda
are
we
to
infer
that
the
simple
act
of
reporting
an
event
in
a
newspaper
constitutes
antiisrael
activity
or
propaganda
or
was
it
south
africa
the
la
times
reporter
was
based
in
south
africa
after
all
