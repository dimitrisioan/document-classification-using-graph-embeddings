try
coming
up
with
your
own
definition
of
any
or
all
selfhating
peoples
to
me
any
who
reject
their
culture
to
the
point
where
they
only
see
the
absolute
negatives
of
that
culture
generally
or
regarding
a
particular
event
and
accept
only
those
views
purely
opposing
aspects
of
that
culture
thus
selective
belief
inuse
of
historical
facts
and
a
complete
ignoring
of
context
results
hate
their
culture
i
believe
that
things
are
getting
mixed
here
critizicing
israel
andor
being
antizionist
is
not
seeing
the
absolute
negatives
of
that
culture
if
that
culture
referred
to
is
israeli
being
antizionist
can
be
seen
as
a
complete
denial
of
that
entitys
right
to
exist
and
its
legitimacy
just
as
saying
that
islam
has
no
right
to
establish
and
implement
a
state
that
includes
any
nonmuslims
both
are
absolute
onedimensional
views
of
that
culture
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
state
maybe
because
a
person
can
see
the
positives
of
that
culture
is
that
that
person
opposes
zionism
and
the
actions
of
the
state
of
israel
if
that
were
the
case
one
would
expect
a
few
of
that
cultures
positives
to
be
discussed
with
regard
to
the
issue
at
hand
since
the
issue
centers
on
israeli
culture
i
have
yet
to
hear
of
any
positives
of
that
culture
in
this
discussion
i
for
one
consider
the
actions
of
the
state
of
israel
with
respect
to
the
human
rights
of
the
palestinian
people
as
an
example
of
an
action
thaty
opposes
what
jewish
culture
was
suppose
to
uphold
as
an
example
of
respect
and
what
the
jewish
people
learned
about
oppresion
segregation
and
years
in
the
diaspora
i
agree
with
you
but
i
also
feel
that
when
a
culture
feels
it
is
confronted
by
another
group
that
wishes
to
see
that
culture
disassembled
the
first
culture
has
little
choice
but
to
try
to
secure
its
survival
as
well
as
maintain
its
moral
center
since
the
culture
is
not
about
to
turn
away
from
either
the
matter
of
its
survival
or
the
valuing
of
its
moral
principles
it
has
the
virtually
impossible
job
of
balancing
to
discuss
israels
faults
and
crimes
without
any
recognition
of
this
circumstance
and
reality
it
faces
is
a
conscious
decision
based
on
the
discussants
political
biases
not
on
an
honest
and
empathetically
open
understanding
of
the
situation
the
same
applies
to
those
who
attempt
to
paint
the
palestinian
movement
as
all
bad
and
dispense
with
considerations
of
the
reality
facing
them
that
certainly
describes
elias
since
he
has
no
intention
of
recognizing
that
alongside
the
palestinian
experience
and
perspective
there
exists
also
that
of
israelis
he
might
not
want
to
recognize
that
it
does
not
make
him
a
selfhating
jew
as
far
as
i
see
it
at
most
he
is
a
person
who
is
not
telling
the
truth
you
beg
the
question
by
centering
on
the
symptoms
while
the
issue
of
selfhating
addresses
the
motivations
i
certainly
feel
that
anyone
who
expends
so
much
effort
inflating
distorting
and
robbing
human
context
from
aspects
of
hisher
own
culture
is
reflecting
a
degree
of
dislike
for
it
since
bits
of
that
culture
are
bound
due
to
hisher
upbringing
to
be
a
part
of
himher
a
bit
of
self
dislike
seems
likely
to
be
mixed
in
somewhere
who
is
a
jew
a
person
whose
integrity
decays
when
unmoved
by
the
knowledge
of
wrong
done
to
other
people
a
j
heschel
that
is
why
i
get
moved
when
i
see
the
israeli
army
killing
people
in
the
occupied
territories
as
much
as
i
get
moved
when
i
see
a
plestinian
stabing
people
in
israel
and
this
is
precisely
why
israeli
society
has
been
tremendously
harmed
by
the
actions
it
its
government
has
felt
it
had
to
take
in
response
to
an
other
perceived
as
a
threat
just
as
with
you
there
has
long
been
a
strident
and
emotional
debate
about
the
pain
israelis
feel
when
forced
to
balance
desires
for
survival
and
moral
beliefs
the
trauma
of
having
to
make
that
choice
is
made
worse
by
the
fact
that
neither
can
be
conveniently
brushed
aside
as
a
result
of
a
reasoned
political
debate
for
the
sake
of
the
other
only
reshaped
but
so
far
it
seems
that
the
blame
is
always
put
on
the
other
if
you
read
this
newsgroup
for
example
israel
is
never
guilty
by
herself
she
is
always
responding
to
the
actions
of
the
other
and
it
goes
as
if
the
actions
of
isreal
do
not
also
affect
the
response
of
the
other
in
a
cycle
that
never
ends
also
there
is
blindness
to
try
to
understand
what
the
other
feels
and
why
as
you
well
know
this
process
of
blaming
the
other
for
the
morally
questionable
actions
one
side
is
forced
by
the
other
of
course
to
take
is
thoroughly
practiced
by
both
sides
if
you
are
only
hearing
the
proisraeli
crowds
selfsupporting
arguments
that
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
you
are
not
listening
for
anything
else
i
certainly
hear
the
similarly
distorting
propalestinianproarab
element
in
this
newsgroup
as
well
as
in
socculturearabic
there
is
always
and
excuse
there
is
always
a
rationale
to
explain
why
things
happen
as
they
do
and
what
is
the
worst
part
for
me
there
seems
to
be
all
the
time
an
intention
to
try
to
dehumanize
the
other
as
if
the
other
did
not
care
about
their
future
children
peace
etc
etc
aap
i
agree
agree
agree
agree
however
in
my
response
to
the
initial
discussion
above
between
davidsson
and
those
opposing
his
presentations
i
saw
davidsson
carefully
putting
academic
frills
around
a
blatantly
onesided
series
of
ihatedislike
them
yesidoyesidoyesido
i
did
not
find
the
approach
of
those
opposing
davidsson
to
be
centered
at
all
on
a
denigration
and
denial
of
the
other
side
i
certainly
do
wonder
if
the
degree
to
which
davidssons
views
on
the
middle
east
have
distorted
is
connected
to
his
dislike
and
rejection
of
his
jewish
lineage
having
said
this
however
i
agree
with
you
that
this
constant
accusing
others
of
being
selfhating
jews
seems
pointless
it
is
not
worse
a
label
than
is
why
youre
on
their
side
except
to
perhaps
imply
a
certain
degree
of
overly
enthusiastic
biasedness
