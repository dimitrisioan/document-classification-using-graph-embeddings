ON
THE
MY

AND
I
WENT
TO
THE
MOVIES
THE
SEVEN
OCLOCK
SHOW
AT
THE
THEATER
THAT
IS
ACROSS
FROM
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
ABOUT
YARDS
AWAY
THE
SK
THEATER
THEY
WERE
SHOWING
AN
ARGENTINIAN
FILM
THE
ABYSS
BEFORE
THE
FILM
WE
NOTICED
ABOUT
TO
PEOPLE
STANDING
NEAR
THE
PODIUM
AT
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
BUT
THEY
WERE
SILENT
THERES
NO
CONVERSATION
WHATSOEVER
AND
WE
COULDNT
FIGURE
OUT
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
THAT
IS
WE
KNEW
IT
WAS
ABOUT
KARABAGH
BUT
WHAT
IT
WAS
EXACTLY
WHAT
THEY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
IF
SOMEONE
GAVE
A
SPEECH
OR
NOT
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
WE
BOUGHT
OUR
TICKETS
THERE
WERE
OR
PEOPLE
IN
THE
THEATER
THIS
WAS
A
VERY
SMALL
NUMBER
FOR
THAT
LARGE
MOVIE
THEATER
THE
FILM
STARTED
ABOUT
MINUTES
LATER
THEY
STOPPED
THE
FILM
A
CROWD
BURST
IN
ABOUT
PEOPLE
THEY
CAME
UP
ONTO
THE
STAGE
WELL
MOSTLY
THEY
WERE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
FROM
TO
YEARS
OLD
THEY
DEMANDED
THAT
AN
ARMENIAN
WOMAN
COME
UP
ONTO
THE
STAGE
THEY
USED
FOUL
LANGUAGE
AND
SAID
THAT
THEY
WERE
GOING
TO
SHOW
WHAT
AZERBAIJANIS
WERE
CAPABLE
OF
WHAT
THEY
COULD
DO
TO
ARMENIAN
GIRLS
I
THOUGHT
THATS
WHAT
THEY
MEANT
BECAUSE
THEY
HAD
DEMANDED
A
GIRL
SPECIFICALLY
MARINA
AND
I
WERE
SITTING
TOGETHER
I
TOLD
HER
TO
MOVE
OVER
THERE
WERE
SOME
RUSSIAN
GIRLS
SITTING
NEARBY
SO
THAT
IF
SOMEONE
RECOGNIZED
ME
OR
IF
SOMETHING
HAPPENED
THEY
WOULD
TAKE
ME
AND
NOT
MARINA
IT
GOT
QUIET
OR
GIRLS
JUMPED
UP
TO
RUN
OUT
BUT
THE
DOOR
WAS
CLOSEDITS
ONLY
OPENED
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
SHOWAND
THEY
RETURNED
TO
THEIR
SEATS
EVERYONE
IN
THE
THEATER
WAS
LOOKING
AT
ONE
ANOTHER
RUSSIANS
AZERBAIJANIS
PEOPLE
OF
VARIOUS
NATIONALITIES
BUT
NO
ONE
REACTED
AT
ALL
NO
ONE
IN
THE
AUDITORIUM
MADE
A
SOUND
THEY
WERE
SILENT
LOOKING
AT
ONE
ANOTHER
AND
GRADUALLY
STARTED
TO
LEAVE
SOME
GUY
A
REALLY
FAT
ONE
SAYS
OK
WEVE
SCARED
THEM
ENOUGH
LETS
LEAVE
THEY
LEAVE
SLOWLY
POMPOUSLY
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
THOSE
PEOPLE
WERE
NOT
THEMSELVES
EITHER
THEY
HAD
SMOKED
A
BUNCH
OF
ANASHA
OR
HAD
TAKEN
SOMETHING
ELSE
BECAUSE
THEY
ALL
LOOKED
BEASTLY
LIKE
THEY
WERE
READY
TO
TEAR
ANYONE
APART
THEN
IT
WAS
ALL
OVER
AS
THOUGH
NOTHING
HAD
HAPPENED
AT
ALL
THE
FILM
STARTED
UP
AGAIN
IT
WAS
ONE
OF
THOSE
CHEERFUL
FILMS
WHICH
SHOULD
HAVE
ONLY
BROUGHT
PLEASURE
MADE
YOU
HAPPY
TO
BE
ALIVE
WE
COULD
BARELY
SIT
TO
THE
END
SO
IT
HAD
STARTED
AT
SEVEN
IT
WAS
OVER
BY
NINE
AND
IT
WAS
DARK
MARINA
AND
I
WERE
WALKING
HOME
LENIN
STREET
THATS
THE
CENTER
OF
TOWN
LENIN
STREET
WAS
PACKED
JUST
PACKED
WITH
YOUNG
PEOPLE
THEY
WERE
SHOUTING
SOMETHING
ABOUT
KARABAGH
AND
SOMETHING
ABOUT
ARMENIANS
WE
WERENT
ESPECIALLY
LISTENING
BECAUSE
THE
WAY
WE
WERE
FEELING
WE
DIDNT
KNOW
IF
WE
WERE
GOING
TO
MAKE
IT
HOME
OR
NOT
AND
JUST
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
ANYWAY
PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION
WASNT
RUNNING
INCIDENTALLY
WHEN
WE
CAME
OUT
OF
THE
THEATER
WE
SAW
POLICE
POLICEMEN
STANDING
THERE
THE
DIRECTOR
OF
THE
MOVIE
THEATER
WAS
LOOKING
AT
THE
DOORS
BECAUSE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
LEAVING
THEY
HAD
BROKEN
THE
GLASS
THE
DOORS
THERE
ARE
BASICALLY
ALL
GLASS
EVERYTHING
WAS
BROKEN
HE
STOOD
THERE
GRIEF
STRICKEN
BUT
LOOKING
AS
THOUGH
NOTHING
REALLY
BIG
HAD
HAPPENED
LIKE
SOME
NAUGHTY
BOYS
HAD
JUST
BROKEN
THEM
QUITE
BY
ACCIDENT
WITH
A
SLINGSHOT
WELL
SINCE
HE
LOOKED
MORE
OR
LESS
CALM
I
DECIDED
THAT
NOTHING
ALL
THAT
SUPER
SERIOUS
HAD
HAPPENED
WE
WENT
OUT
VERY
SLOWLY
WE
WANTED
TO
CATCH
A
BUS
WE
LIVE
LITERALLY
ONE
STOP
AWAY
WE
DIDNT
WANT
TO
GO
ON
FOOT
NOT
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
DARK
BUT
BECAUSE
SOMETHING
MIGHT
HAPPEN
WE
FLAGGED
DOWN
A
CAB
BUT
THE
DRIVER
DIDNT
WANT
TO
TAKE
US
WE
TOLD
HIM
WE
LIVE
NEAR
THE
BUS
STATION
AND
HE
SAID
HED
TAKE
US
TO
THE
BUS
STATION
AND
NOT
A
YARD
FARTHER
I
SAID
WELL
OK
SO
WE
GOT
INTO
THE
CAB
AND
MANAGED
TO
GET
THERE
SOMETHING
INCREDIBLE
WAS
HAPPENING
AT
THE
BUS
STATION
THERE
WAS
A
TRAFFIC
JAM
PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION
WAS
AT
A
STANDSTILL
AND
EVERYONE
WAS
SHOUTING
KARABAGH
THEYRE
NOT
GOING
TO
GIVE
UP
KARABAGH
I
GO
HOME
AND
TELL
MY
FAMILY

IMMEDIATE
PANIC
IN
THE
HOUSE
MAMMA

MANAGED
TO
CHEER
OURSELVES
UP
NOTHING
THAT
BAD

HAPPEN
WHERE

JUST
WHAT
KIND
OF
SOCIAL
ORDER

HAVE
SOMEHOW
WE

JUST
A

IN

BUT
THE

WOULDNT
CONSENT
LYUDA
CAME
BACK
TO
OUR
PLACE
AND
LAY
UNDER
THE

I

SOMEHOW
I
REMEMBERED

HE

LIVES
BECAUSE

NOT
ONLY
IN
YEREVAN
BECAUSE
THERE
THEY
MURDERED
THEM
ALL
ONE
AFTER
THE
NEXT
WITHOUT
STOPPING
AFTER

I
THINK

IN
MICRODISTRICT
NO

TO
OF
THEM
WERE
FROM
BUILDINGS
AND
IN
OUR
BUILDING
ONE
PERSON
DIED
AND

OF
OURS
THERE
YOUNG
AZERBAIJANI
MEN
STOPPED
THE
MOB
AND
WOULDNT
LET
IT
INTO
THEIR
BUILDING
INCIDENTALLY
WHEN
WE
WERE
AT
THE
NEIGHBORS
MARINA
CALLED
OUR
RELATIVES

EYE
AGAIN
MY
FOREHEAD

ONEHALF
OF
MY

HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
I
WOULD
SURVIVE
GET
MY
NORMAL
APPEARANCE
BACK

BE
ABLE
TO
GRASP
ANYTHING
AT
ALL
I
STARTED
TO
SCREAM
AT
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHY
DID
YOU
COME
WHO
SENT
YOU
HERE
NO
ONE
WANTS
YOU
HERE
HAVENT
YOU
KILLED
PEOPLE
PEOPLE
YET
WHAT

YOU
DOING
HERE
ONE
OF
THE
SOLDIERS

SCREAM
AT
US
WERE
MUSLIMS
BUT

NOT
FROM
THE
SUMGAIT
POLICE

AT
THAT
POINT
THE
DAGHESTAN
POLICE

THERE
WHEN
WE
GOT

THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
THERE

AN
AWFUL
LOT
OF

AND
THE
SERIOUSLY
INJURED
TO
TREAT
THEM
THERE
IN
THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
I
DONT

WHAT
THEY
WERE
THERE
FOR
THERE

ALSO
DOCTORS
FROM
BAKU
THERE
THEY
EXAMINED
LYUDA
AND
ME
AND
SAID
THESE
WOMEN
NEED
TO
GO
TO
THE
MATERNITY
HOME
BUT
WE
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
DO
WITH
THE
REST
SO
THEY
TOOK
US
AND
I
LOST
CONTACT
WITH
MY
PARENTS
MY
BOSS
EVERYONE
MY
BOSS
SAID
DONT
WORRY
ILL
FIND
YOU
NO

WHERE
YOU
ARE
NO

WE
WENT
TO
THE
HOSPITAL
THERE
WE
WERE
EXAMINED
BY
A
DEPARTMENT
HEAD
FROM
THE
SUMGAIT
MATERNITY
HOME
PASHAYEVA
I
THINK
HER
NAME
WAS
SHE
EXAMINED
US
THE
AMBULANCE
WAS
FROM
BAKU
I
FIGURED
OUT
THAT
THE
SUMGAIT
AMBULANCES
HADNT
DONE
ANYTHING
THEY
DIDNT
RESPOND
TO
ANY
CALLS
PEOPLE
CALLED
AND
NEITHER
THE
POLICE
NOR
THE
AMBULANCES
SHOWED
ANY
SIGN
OF
LIFE
THAT
DOCTOR
LOOKED
ME
OVER
AND
I
COULD
TELL
FROM
HER
BEHAVIOR
THAT
SOMETHING
VERY
GOOD
HAD
HAPPENED
FOR
SHE
BECAME
QUITE
GLAD
I
EVEN
THOUGHT
TO
MYSELF
GOD
CAN
IT
BE
THAT
NOTHING
ALL
THAT
BAD
IS
WRONG
SHE
LOOKS
ME
OVER
AND
SAYS
NOW
WHY
ARE
YOU
SUFFERING
SO
YOU
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
YOUR
PEOPLE
HAVE
BEEN
DOING
YOUR
PEOPLE
DID
EVEN
WORSE
THINGS
AND
I
THINK
GREAT
I
HAVE
TO
DEAL
WITH
HER
AND
I
FELT
SO
BAD
I
THOUGHT
WHY
DONT
I
JUST
DIE
SO
AS
NOT
TO
HAVE
TO
HEAR
MORE
STUFF
LIKE
THIS
FROM
PEOPLE
LIKE
HER
HERE
I
AM
IN
THIS
CONDITION
AND
BEING
TOLD
ABOUT
SOMETHING
THAT
OUR
PEOPLE
DID
I
JUST
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
ENERGY
TO
SAY
HOW
COULD
OUR
PEOPLE
POSSIBLY
BE
SMART
ENOUGH
TO
THINK
OF
SOMETHING
THAT
YOURS
HAVENT
ALREADY
DONE
I
STAYED
THERE
THEN
THEY
BROUGHT
IN
ANOTHER
WOMAN
IRA
B
SHE
WAS
MARRIED
AND
SHE
WAS
RAPED
IN
HER
OWN
APARTMENT
TOO
THERE
WERE
THREE
OF
US
IRA
LYUDA
AND
THE
NEXT
MORNING
THEY
TOOK
LYUDA
AND
IRA
AWAY
THEY
DIDNT
DO
ANYTHING
TO
HELP
US
THIS
WAS
IN
THE
OLD
MATERNITY
HOME
IN
THE
COMBINED
BLOCK
THEY
DIDNT
DO
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
EXAMINE
ME
THAT
WAS
IT
I
DIDNT
WANT
ANY
SHOTS
OR
TRANQUILIZER
NOTHING
WHAT
SHOTS
COULD
HAVE
CALMED
ME
DOWN
I
DIDNT
EVEN
WANT
TO
LOOK
AT
THEM
I
LAY
IN
THE
WARD
EITHER
IT
JUST
WORKED
OUT
THAT
WAY
OR
THEY
DID
IT
ON
PUR
POSE
BUT
I
WAS
ALONE
I
WAS
ALONE
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
WARDS
WERE
PACKED
THAT
SAME
EVENING
A
WOMAN
CAME
BY
AND
ASKED
ME
WHAT
WAS
WRONG
WITH
ME
THAT
MY
FACE
WAS
DISFIGURED
SHE
ASKED
WHAT
HAD
HAPPENED
TO
ME
AND
I
SAID
BETTER
TO
ASK
YOUR
BROTHER
WHAT
HAPPENED
THERES
NO
POINT
IN
ASKING
ME
YOUR
BROTHER
CAN
BETTER
EXPLAIN
WHAT
HAPPENED
SHE
FELL
INTO
A
FAINT
ALL
THE
DOCTORS
THREW
THEMSELVES
AT
HER
AND
THE
DOCTOR
CATEGORICALLY
FORBADE
ANYONE
TO
COME
INTO
MY
WARD
THEN
PEOPLE
FROM
WORK
CAME
TO
SEE
ME
MY
BOSS
HIS
DAUGHTER
THEY
BROUGHT
ME
CLOTHING
BECAUSE
I
WAS
LITERALLY
NAKED
THE
ONLY
THING
I
HAD
ON
WAS
A
DRESS
BUT
THE
WOMAN
WHO
GAVE
IT
TO
ME
WAS
VERY
SHORT
AND
THE
DRESS
WAS
WAY
UP
ABOVE
MY
KNEES
AND
THE
WOMAN
ORDERLY
SAID
I
CANT
BELIEVE
YOU
PUT
ON
SUCH
A
SHORT
DRESS
WHO
ARE
YOU
SHOWING
OFF
YOUR
LEGS
TO
HERE
I
WENT
BACK
TO
MY
WARD
THINKING
JUST
ONE
MORE
THING
FROM
SOMETHING
PEOPLE
FROM
WORK
CAME
AND
BROUGHT
ME
SOMETHING
IN
A
SACK
APPLES
I
THINK
THREE
OR
FOUR
POUNDS
BUT
I
COULDNT
TAKE
THEM
I
HAD
BECOME
SO
WEAK
THAT
IT
WAS
JUST
EMBARRASSING
I
SAID
THAT
I
COULDNT
TAKE
THE
APPLES
AND
REALLY
DIDNT
HAVE
ANY
APPETITE
NO
ONE
HAD
TO
BRING
ME
ANYTHING
SOME
WOMAN
TOOK
THE
SACK
AND
OH
YES
THEN
I
HEARD
THAT
THE
HEAD
DOCTOR
TELL
A
NURSE
THAT
MY
MEDICAL
HISTORY
SHOULD
BE
HIDDEN
OR
TORN
UP
COMPLETELY
SO
THAT
NO
ONE
WOULD
KNOW
THAT
I
WAS
AN
ARMENIAN
MAYBE
THEY
WOULDNT
FIGURE
IT
OUT
FROM
LOOKING
AT
ME
SO
THEY
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
THINKING
THAT
THERE
WOULD
BE
SOME
KIND
OF
ATTACK
THAT
SOMETHING
ELSE
WOULD
HAPPEN
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
WORSE
OR
PERHAPS
SOMEONE
WAS
OUTSIDE
ON
THE
STREET
I
DONT
KNOW
IN
ANY
CASE
I
DIDNT
SLEEP
A
WINK
THAT
NIGHT
THE
NEXT
MORNING
THEY
PICKED
ME
UP
A
WHOLE
POLICE
DETAIL
PUT
ME
IN
A
BUS
AND
OFF
WE
WENT
I
DIDNT
EVEN
KNOW
WHERE
THEY
WERE
TAKING
ME
THEY
TOOK
ME
TO
THE
CLUB
WHERE
THE
TROOPS
WERE
THE
VERY
ONE

WAS
IN
THAT
ILLFATED

NEAR
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
THERE
WERE
A
GREAT
MANY
TROOPS
TANKS
ARMORED

THE
WHOLE
SCENE

TERRIBLE
I
SAW
A
FEW
PEOPLE
I
KNEW
THERE
AND
THAT
CALMED
ME
A
LITTLE
I
HAD
ALREADY
THOUGHT
THAT
I
WAS
THE
ONLY
ONE
LEFT
SO
THERE
WERE
FIVE
OR
SIX
OF
US
LEFT
IN
SUMGAIT
AFTER
THAT
NIGHT
I
STILL
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
MY
PARENTS
THEY
DIDNT
COME
TO
SEE
ME
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
AND
MY
BOSS
TOLD
ME
THAT
EVERYTHING
WAS
FINE
I
DIDNT
KNOW
WHETHER
TO
BELIEVE
HIM
OR
NOT
MAYBE
HE
WAS
JUST
TRYING
TO
CALM
ME
DOWN
MAYBE
SOMETHING
HAPPENED
ON
THE
WAY
THEN
I
WENT
TO
THE

MOST
THANKFUL
TO
MY

THE
ONLY
ONE
OF
MY
COLLEAGUES
WHO
DIDNT
LOSE
HIS
PRESENCE
OF
MIND
AND
WHO
DIDNT
CHANGE
HIS
OPINIONS
NEITHER
BEFORE

HEAT
OF
THE
MOMENT
NO

I
DONT

THEY
DIDNT
DIAGNOSE
ANYTHING
IN
PARTICULAR
WHEN

THEY
REALIZED
IT
WAS
SENSELESS
TO
STAY
EVERYTHING
GOT
ON
OUR
NERVES
THE
SMELL
THE
SMALL
CHILDREN
THERE
WERE
CHILDREN
AT
THE
SK
CLUB
CHILDREN
WHO
HAD
LITERALLY
JUST
COME
OUT
OF
THE
MATERNITY
HOME
WHAT
WERE
THEY
DOING
IN
A
CLUB
THAT
DIDNT
EVEN
HAVE
RUNNING
WATER
ALL
THE
TIME
AT
FIRST
WE
HAD
TO
PAY
TO
EAT
THERE
THEY
EVEN
OVERCHARGED
US
AS
IT
TURNED
OUT
ON
THE
SECOND
DAY
SOMEONE
TOLD
US
THAT
THEY
WOULD
BRING
US
FOOD
FOR
FREE
THE
CHILDREN
WERE
ILL
EVERYTHING
STANK
THERE
WELL
IMAGINE
ABOUT
PEOPLE
IN
A
SMALL
MOVIE
THEATER
WITH
SEATING
FOR
NO
MORE
THAN
YOU
COULDNT
SIT
OR
LIE
DOWN
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
EVEN
MOVE
THE
STENCH
WAS
AWFUL
EVEN
THE
SMALLEST
INFANTS
TOOK
ILL
OVERNIGHT
THERE
I
HEARD
THAT
THEY
WERE
ARRIVING
SERIOUSLY
ILL
IN
YEREVAN
THE
INFANTS
THEY
HAVE
TO
BE
WASHED
THEY
HAVE
TO
BE
BATHED
NOT
TO
MENTION
THAT
WE
THE
ADULTS
WERE
ILL
AND
NEEDED
CARE
PEOPLE
WERE
FAINTING
RIGHT
AND
LEFT
I
JUST
DONT
KNOW
EVERYONE
WAS
CRYING
EVERYONE
ONLY
THE
YOUNG
PEOPLE
THE
MEN
SOMEHOW
MANAGED
TO
KEEP
IT
TOGETHER
BUT
THE
WOMEN
WERE
IN
A
CONSTANT
STATE
OF
PANIC
IT
SEEMED
TO
EVERYONE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
COME
ANY
MINUTE
AND
KILL
AND
STAB
IT
SEEMED
CLEAR
THAT
WE
HAD
BEEN
GATHERED
TOGETHER
PURPOSELY
LIKE
DURING
THE
WAR
SO
THAT
THEY
COULD
BURN
THE
MOVIE
THEATER
AND
THERE
WOULDNT
BE
A
SINGLE
ARMENIAN
LEFT
THEN
PEOPLE
WENT
UP
TO
THE
ATTIC
I
DIDNT
SEE
THEM
I
ONLY
HEARD
THEM
BECAUSE
I
WAS
LYING
DOWN
AND
COULDNT
GET
UP
I
LAY
RIGHT
ON
THE
STAGE
WE
HAD
SOME
ROOM
THERE
APPARENTLY
THEY
CAUGHT
TWO
PEOPLE
WITH
EITHER
OIL
OR
GAS
I
THINK
THEY
WANTED
TO
BURN
THE
THEATER
MAYBE
SOMEONE
SAW
THEM
I
DIDNT
I
WAS
IN
NO
CONDITION
TO
OPEN
MY
EYES
EVERYONE
WAS
SUSPICIOUS
OF
EVERYONE
ELSE
THEY
WOULD
ASK
ARENT
YOU
AN
AZERBAIJANI
I
THINK
I
SAW
YOU
SOMEWHERE
I
THINK
YOURE
AN
AZERBAIJANI
THEY
LED
OUT
ALL
THE
MEN
AND
STARTED
LETTING
THEM
BACK
IN
BY
CHECKING
THEIR
PASSPORTS
RELATIVES
MIGHT
BE
COVERING
FOR
EACH
OTHER
HALF
OF
THE
PEOPLE
DID
NOT
HAVE
ANY
DOCUMENTS
THERE
WERE
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
RUN
OUT
OF
THEIR
HOMES
IN
NOTHING
BUT
A
PAIR
OF
PANTS
AND
SLIPPERS
OR
WEARING
JUST
A
SHIRT
NOT
LIKE
THEY
SHOULD
HAVE
WITH
THEIR
IDS
SO
ON
THE
ON
SUNDAY
I
THINK
THE
POLICE
DID
NOTHING
TO
HELP
US
ON
MONDAY
EVERYTHING
RESUMED
WHERE
IT
HAD
LEFT
OFF
ON
BLOCK
THEY
DIDNT
SPARE
A
SOUL
THERE
NOT
CHILDREN
NOT
PREGNANT
WOMEN
NOBODY
THEY
KILLED
THEY
BURNED
THEY
HACKED
WITH
AXES
JUST
EVERYTHING
POSSIBLE
THEY
MURDERED
THE
MELKUMIAN
FAMILY
WHOM
I
KNEW
MY
MOTHER
WORKED
WITH
THEM
THEIR
DAUGHTER
INLAW
WENT
TO
SCHOOL
WITH
MY
OLDER
SISTER
THEY
WERE
BRUTALLY
MURDERED
ONLY
THE
TWO
DAUGHTERSINLAW
SURVIVED
BY
A
MIRACLE
ONE
WAS
ABLE
TO
SAVE
HERSELF
SHE
RAN
AWAY
THE
NEIGHBORS
WOULDNT
TAKE
HER
IN
SO
SHE
RAN
ABOUT
THE
BUILDING
UNTIL
SHE
FOUND
REFUGE
SHE
WAS
PREGNANT
AND
HAD
TWO
SMALL
CHILDREN
THIS
ALL
CONTINUED
ON
MONDAY
IN
BLOCK
ON
THE
WHEN
THE
TROOPS
WERE
ALREADY
IN
THE
CITY
THEY
MURDERED
PEOPLE
THEY
OVERTURNED
AUTOMOBILES
AND
THEY
BURNED
ENTIRE
FAMILIES
THEY
SAY
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
KNOW
FOR
SURE
IF
THE
PEOPLE
WERE
ARMENIANS
OR
NOT
I
HEARD
THAT
THE
LEZGINS
SUFFERED
TOO
IM
NOT
SURE
MYSELF
I
DIDNT
SEE
ANY
LEZGINS
WHO
HAD
BEEN
INJURED
THEY
BURNED
CARS
SO
ITS
VERY
DIFFICULT
NOW
TO
SAY
EXACTLY
WHO
DIED
AND
WHO
DIDNT
IT
WAS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
IDENTIFY
THE
CORPSES
OR
RATHER
WHAT
REMAINED
OF
THE
CORPSES
AFTER
THEY
WERE
DOUSED
IN
GASOLINE
AND
BURNED
ITS
ALL
VERY
HARD
TO
IMAGINE
OF
COURSE
I
HEARD
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
DISAPPEARED
WITHOUT
A
TRACE
FROM
THE
BTZ
PLANT
TWO
PEOPLE
INCLUDING
A
WOMAN
WHO
WORKED
THE
NIGHT
SHIFT
AUNT
RAZMELLA
WHO
ALSO
LIVED
IN
MICRODISTRICT
THEY
WERE
STOPPING
BUSES
BETWEEN
BAKU
AND
SUMGAIT
IN
THE
EVENING
PEOPLE
WHO
HAD
BEEN
VISITING
BAKU
WERE
RETURNING
TO
SUMGAIT
AND
PEOPLE
FROM
BAKU
WERE
GOING
HOME
FROM
SUMGAIT
AND
THERE
WERE
STUDENTS
TOO
THEY
WERE
SIMPLY
SAVAGELY
MURDERED
THEY
WERE
STOPPING
THE
BUSES
THE
DRIVERS
IMMEDIATELY
DID
WHAT
THEY
WERE
TOLD
BECAUSE
THERE
WAS
JUST
NO
OTHER
WAY
TO
DEAL
WITH
THAT
HOARD
OF
BRUTALLY
MINDED
PEOPLE
THEY
STOPPED
THE
BUSES
DRAGGED
THE
ARMENIANS
OUT
AND
KILLED
THEM
ON
THE
SPOT
I
DIDNT
SEE
IT
MYSELF
BUT
I
HEARD
THAT
THEY
PUT
THEM
ALL
IN
A
PILE
SO
AS
TO
BURN
THEM
LATER
IT
WAS
HARD
TO
DISCERN
FROM
THE
CORPSES
WELL
YOU
CANT
CALL
THEM
CORPSES
YOU
HAD
TO
FIGURE
OUT
FROM
THE
ASHES
WHO
IT
WAS
L
HEARD
THAT
TWO
FELLOWS
SAVED
TWO
WOMEN
ONE
A
STUDENT
IRA
G
IF
IM
NOT
MISTAKEN
SHE
WAS
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
A
LONG
TIME
AFTER
THAT
AND
SHE
STILL
CANT
FIGURE
OUT
WHO
SAVED
HER
SHE
WAS
ALSO
BRUTALLY
RAPED
AND
BEATEN
AND
THROWN
ONTO
A
PILE
OF
CORPSES
THE
FELLOW
PULLED
HER
OUT
OF
THAT
WHOLE
PILE
OF
CORPSES
PUT
HIS
COAT
ON
HER
TOOK
HER
INTO
HIS
ARMS
AND
CARRIED
HER
TO
THE
CITY
I
STILL
CANT
IMAGINE
HOW
HE
MANAGED
TO
DO
THAT
I
HEARD
THAT
FROM
ENGELS
GRIGORIAN
HE
KNOWS
HER
APPARENTLY
WELL
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
WENT
TO
THAT
HOSPITAL
ANYWAY
SHE
WAS
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
AND
SINGING
A
SONG
IN
ARMENIAN
AND
THEY
WROTE
THE
WORDS
DOWN
AND
I
THINK
HE
STILL
HAS
THAT
PIECE
OF
PAPER
BECAUSE
HE
SAYS
THAT
A
LOT
OF
PEOPLE
NOW
HAVE
THAT
SONG
THE
ONE
SHE
SANG
IN
THE
HOSPITAL
WHERE
SHE
LAY
IN
SUCH
BAD
SHAPE
THEY
COULDNT
FIND
THE
GUY
WHO
SAVED
HER
HE
LEFT
HER
IN
SOMEONES
APARTMENT
AND
CALLED
THE
AMBULANCE
SHE
WAS
IN
SUCH
AWFUL
SHAPE
THAT
PROBABLY
LIKE
ME
SHE
COULDNT
REMEMBER
ANYONES
FACE
I
THINK
THAT
I
KNEW
ONE
OF
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
BROKE
INTO
OUR
HOUSE
MAYBE
I
HAD
TALKED
WITH
HIM
ONCE
BUT
I
RECEIVED
SO
MANY
BLOWS
EVERYTHING
WAS
JUST
KNOCKED
OUT
OF
MY
HEAD
I
CANT
REMEMBER
TO
THIS
DAY
WHO
HE
WAS
THEN
IT
SEEMS
I
SAW
THE
SECRETARY
OF
THE
DIRECTORATES
PARTY
ORGANIZATION
WHERE
MARINA
WORKS
SHE
GOES
TO
SCHOOL
AND
WORKS
SHE
GOES
TO
NIGHT

DAY
AT
THE
KHIMZASHCHITA
CONSTRUCTION
AND
INSTALLATION
ADMINISTRATION
IM
THE
SECRETARY
OF
THE
KOMSOMOL
ORGANIZATION
AT
OUR

AND
OFTEN

WE
HAD
JOINT
MEETINGS
I
KNOW
THEM
ALL
IVE
EVEN
TALKED
WITH
THEM
AND
HE
I
KNOW
IS
FROM
ARMENIA
AN
AZERBAIJANI
BUT
FROM
ARMENIA
IT
BECAME
OBVIOUS
THAT
MANY
OF
THOSE
PEOPLE
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
BORN
IN
ARMENIA
THEY
TOOK
ME
TO
VARIOUS
POLICE
STATIONS
TO
THE
POLICE
PRECINCT
AND
TO
THE
PROCURACY
BECAUSE
THE
USSR
PROCURACY
GOT
INVOLVED
IN
THE
CASE
AND
I
IDEN
TIFIED
THE
PHOTOGRAPHS
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
I
COULD
MORE
OR
LESS
RECOGNIZE
THEY
SHOWED
ME
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
WERE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
THEYRE
WORKING
ON
OUR
CASE
BUT
I
CANT
EVEN
RECOGNIZE
THEM
ALTHOUGH
IT
WAS
PROVED
THAT
THEY
WERE
THE
ONES
THEYRE
PROCESSING
IT
SOMEHOW
THEY
TELL
ME
THAT
THEY
KNOW
THAT
SOMEONE
HELD
ME
BY
THE
ARM
AND
SOMEONE
ELSE
HELD
ME
BY
THE
LEG
WHEN
THEY
WERE
DRAGGING
ME
THERE
WAS
SOMEONE
ELSE
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
WHO
DID
NOT
EVEN
TOUCH
ME
HE
JUST
STOLE
A
BLANKET
AND
AN
EARRING
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
ALL
THESE
PEOPLE
ALL
OF
THEM
AS
MUCH
AS
IVE
HEARD
ABOUT
THEM
AND
SEEN
THEM
THEY
WERE
ALL
FROM
KAFAN
THE
SECRETARY
OF
THE
PARTY
ORGANIZATION
IS
NAMED
NAJAF
NAJAF
RZAYEV
HE
WAS
THERE
WHEN
EVERYTHING
STARTED
IT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
HIM
BECAUSE
I
DIDNT
RECOGNIZE
ANYONE
ELSE
IN
THE
CROWD
WHOM
I
KNEW
BESIDES
HIM
ALL
THE
MORE
SINCE
I
TOLD
HIM
LISTEN
YOU
DO
SOMETHING
BECAUSE
YOU
KNOW
ME
HE
TURNED
AWAY
AND
WENT
TOWARD
THE
BEDROOM
WHERE
MARINA
WAS
WELL
YOU
COULDNT
SEE
MARINA
ANYWAY
THERE
WAS
SUCH
A
NOISY
CONFUSION
OF
PEOPLE
THAT
YOU
COULDNT
MAKE
OUT
ANYONE
ALL
OF
IT
FLEW
RIGHT
OUT
OF
MY
HEAD
AND
THEN
GRADUALLY
I
BECAME
MYSELF
AGAIN
AT
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
THERE
WERE
MILITARY
PEOPLE
THERE
I
TOLD
THEM
WHAT

ON
AND
THEY
WROTE

ALL
DOWN
I
TOLD
THEM
HIS
NAME
ON
MARCH
THE
SECRETARY
OF
OUR
FIRST
TRUST
PARTY
ORGANIZATION
THE
ONE
WERE
PART
OF
CAME
TO
SEE
US
HIS
NAME
IS
NAJAF
RZAYEV
I
TELL
MAMMA
IF
HES
HERE
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
I
GAVE
HIS
NAME
IT
MEANS
THAT
EITHER
HIS
ALIBI
HAS
BEEN
CONFIRMED
OR
PROBABLY
THAT
THEY
THINK
IM
CRAZY
NOT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
MY
WORDS
HE
SAID
WHAT
DID
THEY
DO
TO
YOU
HOW
AWFUL
MYSELF
I
HID
AN
ARMENIAN
FAMILY
THEN
AFTER
SOME
TIME
GOES
BY
HE
COMES
BACK
AGAIN
AND
SAYS
SOMETHING
ENTIRELY
DIFFERENT
I
WASNT
AT

MY
FAMILY
AND
I
WENT
TO
BAKU
I
SAID
MARINA
WHAT
IS
HE
SAYING

BY
A
PROCURATOR

SO
NAMES
INVOLVED

ARE
THEY
DOING
WITH
RZAYEV
DID
HE
PROVE
HIS
ALIBI
OR

THINK
THAT
SINCE
I
WAS
HIT
IN
THE
HEAD
I
CANT
SAY
ANYTHING
FOR
SURE
WHETHER
IT
WAS
HIM
OR
NOT
IT
WILL
BE
AN
INSULT
IF
HE
WAS
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
AND
DOESNT
HAVE
TO
PAY
FOR
IT
BUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
IM
AFRAID
TO
SAY
IM
A
HUNDRED
PERCENT
SURE
THAT
IT
WAS
HE
BECAUSE
NO
MAT
TER
WHO
I
NAME
THEY
TELL
ME
NO
YOURE
WRONG
HE
DIDNT
DO
THAT
THAT
ONE
WASNT
THERE
ALL
THE
FACES

GOTTEN
MIXED
UP
IN
MY
MIND
WHO

WHAT
EXACTLY
I
CANT
SAY
WHEN
THEY
TOOK
ME
OUTSIDE
THERE
WAS
A
WHOLE
CROWD
THERE
BUT
I
DIDNT
SEE

SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
I
ALWAYS
GOT
IT
BECAUSE
OF
MY
EYES
PEOPLE
WERE
ALWAYS
HASSLING
ME
FOR
SOME
REASON
IT
ALWAYS
SEEMED
TO
ME
THAT
MY
EYES
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BEATING
MY
FACE
I
THOUGHT
THEY
WERE
TRYING
TO
PUT
MY
EYES
OUT
SO
I
HAD
MY
EYES
CLOSED
THEY
TOOK
ME
OUTSIDE
AND
STARTED
TO
BEAT
ME
A
YOUNG
GUY
HELD
MY
ARMS
HE
WORKS

THE
BTZ

AND
RIGHT
NEARBY

A
WHILE
AFTER

BUT
THEY
DIDNT
SAY
ANYTHING
TO
ONE
ANOTHER
HE
SAID
THAT

AZERBAIJANI
KGB
THEY
TOOK

PHOTOGRAPHED
THOSE
PEOPLE
WHO

CAUGHT
AT
CURFEW
AND
IVE
GOT
THEM
ALL
CONFUSED
I
SAY
THE
FACE

THIS
THE
GUY
IN
THE
WHITE
COAT
WITH
THE
RED
CLASPS
BUT
HE
COULD
TAKE
THAT
COAT
OFF
AND
BURN
IT
SOMEWHERE
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
LIKE
LOOKING
FOR
A
NEEDLE
IN
A
HAYSTACK
WELL
THIS
GUY
GRIGORIAN
I
SAID
HE
WAS
IN
OUR
APARTMENT
BUT

BEAT
ME
OR
RAPED
ME
BUT
HE
WAS
IN

ASKING
ME
PLEADING
WITH
ME
THERES
NO
NEED

THIS
STUFF
LOOK

THE
EYES
YOURE

A
SISTER

I
TOOK
A
LOOK

MY
GOD
HEAVEN

THAT
I
SHOULD
HAVE
A
BROTHER
LIKE

BUT
THEY
WERE
SATISFIED
WITH
MY
RESPONSES
BECAUSE

SEEING
THE
FACES
HEARING
THE
VOICES
TWO
PEOPLE

ANOTHER

WHEN
IVE

THREE
KIDS

THIS
GUY

IN

WAS
FROM
SUMGAIT
THEY
WERE
SURE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
GET
THE
APARTMENT
BESIDES
THE
NEIGHBORS
WERE
AZERBAIJANI
WHY
SHOULD
THEY
BURN
THE
APARTMENT
THEY
MIGHT
BURN
AZERBAIJANIS
THATS
WHAT
THEY
SAID
HOW
DID
THEY
KNOW
THERE
WERE
AZERBAIJANIS
THERE
IF
THEY
JUST
PICKED
A
PLACE
THINKING
THAT
ARMENIANS
LIVED
THERE
WE
HAVE
A
LIST
OF
THE
RESIDENTS
FOR
OUR
PART
OF
THE
BUILDING
OUR
NAME
IS
IN
THERE
BUT
HOW
COULD
THEY
KNOW
THAT
AZERBAIJANIS
LIVED
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
OF
THE
WALL
FROM
US
SO
THEY
DIDNT
SET
FIRE
TO
OUR
APARTMENT
I
DONT
KNOW
I
WAS
IN
SUCH
BAD
SHAPE
THAT
IF
ALL
OF
IT
HAD
COME
TO
A
HALT
WHEN
I
WAS
OUTSIDE
IF
SOMEONE
HAD
ASKED
ME
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
I
WOULD
HAVE
SAID
THAT
A
CIVIL
WAR
WAS
GOING
ON
WELL
MAYBE
NOT
CIVIL
BUT
PROBABLY
CIVIL
BECAUSE
WHEN
THEY
WERE
BEATING
ME
I
OPENED
MY
EYES
AND
SAW
THAT
ALL
THE
NEIGHBORS
WERE
STANDING
ON
THEIR
BALCONIES
AND
WATCHING
LIKE
AT
A
FREE
HORROR
FILM
SO
A
CIVIL
WAR
WAS
GOING
ON
AND
ONLY
THE
ARMENIANS
WERE
BEING
FOUGHT
IF
IT
WERE
A
WORLD
WAR
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
THEY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
FIGHTING
EVERYONE
BUT
THEY
ONLY
FOUGHT
US
THEN
I
MET
SOME
WOMEN
FROM
OUR
BUILDING
SOME
AZERBAIJANIS
THEY
ARE
CRYING
THEY
TELL
ME
KARINA
WE
SAW
ALL
OF
IT
HOW
COULD
IT
HAPPEN
THEYRE
ASKING
ME
WELL
I
JUST
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
TO
CALL
IT
IF
A
NORMAL
GIRL
CAN
STAND
THERE
AND
WATCH
WHAT
HAPPENED
TO
ME
I
THINK
THAT
IF
IT
WERE
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
EITHER
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO
TAKE
IT
OR
I
WOULD
HAVE
TRIED
TO
AVERT
IT
LIKE
THAT
ONE
AZERBAIJANI
WOMAN
DID
IN
FRONT
OF
OUR
BUILDING
A
WOMAN
LIVES
THERE
AN
AWFUL
DISSIPATED
WOMAN
IF
YOU
CAN
CALL
HER
A
WOMAN
THE
DISSIPATED
LIFE
SHE
LEADS
TWO
ARMENIAN
FAMILIES
LIVE
THERE
IN
HER
PART
OF
THE
BUILDING
SHE
CAME
OUT
ON
THE
BALCONY
AND
SAW
WHAT
WAS
HAPPENING
TO
ME
AND
STARTED
TO
SCREAM
AND
CURSE
SHE
CAME
DOWN
TO
THE
ENTRYWAY
AND
SAID
YOULL
COME
IN
THIS
ENTRYWAY
OVER
MY
DEAD
BODY
SO
NOT
ONE
OF
THEM
TOOK
IT
IN
HIS
HEAD
TO
GO
IN
THAT
ENTRYWAY
SOME
FOLKS
WERE
SAYING
THAT
THOSE
PEOPLE
WERE
SO
OUT
OF
CONTROL
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
I
DONT
THINK
THATS
TRUE
THEY
KNEW
VERY
WELL
WHAT
THEY
WERE
DOING
IF
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
LIFT
A
HAND
AGAINST
THAT
WOMAN
THEY
COULDNT
HAVE
CARED
LESS
ABOUT
HER
BUT
THE
FACT
THAT
SHE
WAS
AN
AZERBAIJANI
STOPPED
THEM
THEY
WERE
JUST
BEASTS
THEY
HAD
SMOKED
SO
MUCH
WHEN
THEY
CAME
TO
OUR
PLACE
THEY
WERE
ALL
CHEWING
SOMETHING
I
NOTICED
EVERYONE
WHO
CAME
INTO
THE
APARTMENT
WAS
CHEWING
SOMETHING
I
THINK
MY
GOD
MAYBE
I
JUST
THINK
THAT
MAYBE
IM
LOSING
MY
MIND
BUT
NO
THEYRE
ALL
CHEWING
SOMETHING
MAYBE
IT
IS
SOME
KIND
OF
DRUG
IT
MUST
BE
BECAUSE
AT
FIRST
GLANCE
THEY
ALL
SEEMED
TO
BE
SUCH
NORMAL
PEOPLE
YOUNG
CLEANSHAVEN
LOOKING
EXACTLY
AS
IF
THEY
HAD
COME
TO
SOME
SORT
OF
CELEBRATION
BUT
THEY
WERE
SHOUTING
SOMETHING
THEY
DIDNT
TALK
THEY
SHOUTED
AS
THOUGH
THERE
WERE
DEAF
PEOPLE
THERE
THEY
SCREAMED
AND
SCREAMED
YEAH
KILLING
KILLING
WERE
KILLING
THE
ARMENIANS
ONLY
THEY
DIDNT
SHOUT
KILL
THEY
SHOUTED
GURUN
ERMIANLARY
GURUN
LITERALLY
MEANS
KILL
OR
DESTROY
THATS
HOW
IT
WAS
ILL
CONTINUE
WE
HID
IN
A
CAPTAINS
APARTMENT
HES
AN
AZERBAIJANI
HIS

A
TATAR
WE

THIS
WAS
WHILE

THEY

APPARENTLY
THEY

TIME
THEY
WERE

FOR

THEY
TOOK
EVERYTHING
THAT
WAS
LYING
ON

HELPED
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THEY
WERE
OBLIGATED

THEY
COULD
HAVE
HELPED
US
BECAUSE
THAT
ONE
WOMAN
WAS
ABLE
TO
STOP

BRUTAL
CROWD
BY

THAT
MEANS
THEY
COULD
HAVE
TOO
