clothes

at
the
same
time

on
the
my
sister
marina
and
i
went
to
the
movies
the
seven
oclock
show
at
the
theater
that
is
across
from
the
city
party
committee
about
yards
away
the
sk
theater
they
were
showing
an
argentinian
film
the
abyss
before
the
film
we
noticed
about
to
people
standing
near
the
podium
at
the
city
party
committee
but
they
were
silent
theres
no
conversation
whatsoever
and
we
couldnt
figure
out
what
was
going
on
that
is
we
knew
it
was
about
karabagh
but
what
it
was
exactly
what
they
were
talking
about
if
someone
gave
a
speech
or
not
we
didnt
know
we
bought
our
tickets
there
were
or
people
in
the
theater
this
was
a
very
small
number
for
that
large
movie
theater
the
film
started
about
minutes
later
they
stopped
the
film
a
crowd
burst
in
about
people
they
came
up
onto
the
stage
well
mostly
they
were
young
people
from
to
years
old
they
demanded
that
an
armenian
woman
come
up
onto
the
stage
they
used
foul
language
and
said
that
they
were
going
to
show
what
azerbaijanis
were
capable
of
what
they
could
do
to
armenian
girls
i
thought
thats
what
they
meant
because
they
had
demanded
a
girl
specifically
marina
and
i
were
sitting
together
i
told
her
to
move
over
there
were
some
russian
girls
sitting
nearby
so
that
if
someone
recognized
me
or
if
something
happened
they
would
take
me
and
not
marina
it
got
quiet
or
girls
jumped
up
to
run
out
but
the
door
was
closedits
only
opened
at
the
end
of
the
showand
they
returned
to
their
seats
everyone
in
the
theater
was
looking
at
one
another
russians
azerbaijanis
people
of
various
nationalities
but
no
one
reacted
at
all
no
one
in
the
auditorium
made
a
sound
they
were
silent
looking
at
one
another
and
gradually
started
to
leave
some
guy
a
really
fat
one
says
ok
weve
scared
them
enough
lets
leave
they
leave
slowly
pompously
it
seemed
to
me
that
those
people
were
not
themselves
either
they
had
smoked
a
bunch
of
anasha
or
had
taken
something
else
because
they
all
looked
beastly
like
they
were
ready
to
tear
anyone
apart
then
it
was
all
over
as
though
nothing
had
happened
at
all
the
film
started
up
again
it
was
one
of
those
cheerful
films
which
should
have
only
brought
pleasure
made
you
happy
to
be
alive
we
could
barely
sit
to
the
end
so
it
had
started
at
seven
it
was
over
by
nine
and
it
was
dark
marina
and
i
were
walking
home
lenin
street
thats
the
center
of
town
lenin
street
was
packed
just
packed
with
young
people
they
were
shouting
something
about
karabagh
and
something
about
armenians
we
werent
especially
listening
because
the
way
we
were
feeling
we
didnt
know
if
we
were
going
to
make
it
home
or
not
and
just
what
had
happened
anyway
public
transportation
wasnt
running
incidentally
when
we
came
out
of
the
theater
we
saw
police
policemen
standing
there
the
director
of
the
movie
theater
was
looking
at
the
doors
because
when
they
were
leaving
they
had
broken
the
glass
the
doors
there
are
basically
all
glass
everything
was
broken
he
stood
there
grief
stricken
but
looking
as
though
nothing
really
big
had
happened
like
some
naughty
boys
had
just
broken
them
quite
by
accident
with
a
slingshot
well
since
he
looked
more
or
less
calm
i
decided
that
nothing
all
that
super
serious
had
happened
we
went
out
very
slowly
we
wanted
to
catch
a
bus
we
live
literally
one
stop
away
we
didnt
want
to
go
on
foot
not
because
it
was
dark
but
because
something
might
happen
we
flagged
down
a
cab
but
the
driver
didnt
want
to
take
us
we
told
him
we
live
near
the
bus
station
and
he
said
hed
take
us
to
the
bus
station
and
not
a
yard
farther
i
said
well
ok
so
we
got
into
the
cab
and
managed
to
get
there
something
incredible
was
happening
at
the
bus
station
there
was
a
traffic
jam
public
transportation
was
at
a
standstill
and
everyone
was
shouting
karabagh
theyre
not
going
to
give
up
karabagh
i
go
home
and
tell
my
family
whats
going
on
and
theres
immediate
panic
in
the
house
mamma
says
what
should
we
do
like
the
end
had
come
they
were
going
to
come
kill
us
thats
it
somehow
we
managed
to
cheer
ourselves
up
nothing
that
bad
could
happen
where
are
we
living
anyway
just
what
kind
of
social
order
do
we
have
somehow
we
manage
to
calm
mamma
down
and
we
went
to
bed
but
no
one
could
sleep
everyone
made
as
though
nothing
had
happened
that
was
on
saturday
in
short
the
day
went
by
we
didnt
go
anywhere
and
didnt
call
our
relatives
no
one
did
anything
because
life
goes
on
that
day
i
realized
something
was
approaching
but
what
exactly
i
couldnt
guess
on
the
everything
was
like
it
was
supposed
to
be
we
lived
like
we
always
had
there
were
five
of
us
at
home
mamma
papa
and
us
three
sisters
lyuda
marina
and
i
my
sister
lyuda
was
in
yerevan
at
the
time
we
sat
at
home
and
no
one
went
out
later
we
learned
that
a
demonstration
had
started
that
morning
it
all
started
they
were
smashing
up
stores
we
were
sitting
at
home
and
didnt
know
anything
about
it
then
a
girlfriend
of
mine
lyuda
zimogliad
came
by
at
around
three
oclock
i
think
we
worked
together
we
did
our
apprenticeships
together
shes
a
russian
girl
she
said
that
something
awful
was
happening
in
town
i
asked
dont
they
want
armenians
well
what
are
they
after
if
theyre
already
in
that
state
she
says
no
nothing
like
that
its
just
a
demonstration
but
its
awful
to
watch
it
somehow
it
feels
like
a
war
has
broken
out
public
transportation
has
been
stopped
the
cabs
the
buses
well
its
just
a
nightmare
then
papa
decides
to
go
to
the
drugstore
my
mother
was
having
allergy
problems
at
the
time
he
left
the
house
and
our
neighbor
aunt
vera
asked
him
where
are
you
going
stop
there
are
such
terrible
things
going
on
in
the
courtyard
arent
you
afraid
to
go
out
papa
didnt
know
what
she
was
talking
about
she
simply
pushed
him
back
into
the
entryway
he
came
home
and
told
mamma
mamma
said
well
if
aunt
vera
was
talking
like
that
it
means
that
something
is
really
going
on
but
we
didnt
go
see
her
shes
a
russian
she
lives
across
from
us
i
had
to
see
my
friend
out
around
five
oclock
i
tell
lyuda
ok
look
its
time
for
you
to
go
its
late
already
ill
see
you
out
mamma
says
you
dont
need
to
go
its
too
late
already
you
can
see
what
the
situation
in
town
is
so
we
decided
to
stay
home
dinner
was
ready
mamma
says
let
her
eat
with
us
then
she
can
go
we
sat
down
at
the
table
but
no
one
was
hungry
no
one
was
in
the
mood
we
just
put
everything
out
on
the
table
to
calm
ourselves
down
and
make
it
appear
that
were
eating
we
turned
on
the
television
and
the
show
in
fairytale
land
was
coming
on
we
cleared
the
table
we
hear
some
noise
out
in
the
courtyard
i
go
out
on
the
balcony
but
i
cant
see
whats
going
on
because
the
noise
is
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
bus
station
and
there
is
a
building
in
the
way
there
is
mob
of
people
i
cant
figure
out
whats
happening
theyre
shouting
something
looking
somewhere
i
cant
make
out
what
is
going
on
i
go
down
to
a
neighbor
shes
an
azerbaijani
weve
been
friends
of
her
family
for
about
years
i
go
down
to
look
from
their
place
i
see
people
shouting
looking
at
the
buildings
near
the
bus
station
just
then
soldiers
set
upon
them
about
people
with
clubs
the
mob
runs
off
in
different
directions
i
even
see
several
people
from
our
building
they
are
looking
and
laughing
i
decide
that
means
its
not
all
that
bad
if
they
are
laughing
it
means
theyre
not
killing
anyone
but
now
the
crowd
suddenly
dashes
toward
the
soldiers
one
of
the
soldiers
cannot
manage
to
get
away
they
start
stomping
on
him
with
their
feet
everyones
kicking
him
i
become
ill
and
go
home
and
explain
in
general
terms
that
horrible
things
are
going
on
out
there
cant
speak
well
theyve
probably
killed
that
soldier
the
way
that
crowd
is
if
each
of
them
kicked
him
just
once
they
took
his
club
away
from
him
and
started
to
beat
him
with
it
but
it
was
far
away
and
i
couldnt
see
if
he
got
up
and
left
or
not
i
become
terrified
and
go
home
and
say
lyuda
dont
go
anywhere
stay
at
our
place
because
if
you
go
out
they
could
kill
you
or
then
the
crowd
runs
over
closer
toward
our
building
and
stands
at
the
building
and
starts
shouting
something
we
go
out
onto
the
balcony
all
of
our
neighbors
are
also
out
on
theirs
too
everyone
is
standing
staring
the
mob
is
shouting
and
about
minutes
later
comes
running
toward
our
building
as
it
turns
out
at
the
building
the
azerbaijani
neighbors
went
down
and
kept
them
from
coming
in
theres
only
one
entryway
there
they
could
stop
them
they
all
run
up
to
our
building
mamma
immediately
starts
closing
the
windows
afraid
that
they
might
throw
stones
they
have
stones
and
they
break
the
windows
all
of
them
there
are
very
many
people
we
have
a
large
courtyard
and
its
packed
with
people
they
spill
up
to
the
first
floor
so
they
dont
crush
each
other
they
crawl
up
on
trees
posts
and
garages
its
just
a
huge
cloud
of
people
they
break
and
burn
the
motorcycle
of
the
armenian
sergey
sargisian
from
our
building
we
close
the
windows
and
immediately
hear
tramping
in
our
entryway
they
come
up
to
our
fifth
floor
with
a
tremendous
din
and
roar
its
incomprehensible
mamma
told
me
later
that
they
were
shouting
fathers
name
grisha
open
the
door
weve
come
to
kill
you
or
something
like
that
i
dont
remember
that
i
was
spaced
out
kind
of
mamma
says
into
the
bedroom
quickly
in
the
bedroom
we
have
two
tall
beds
part
of
our
dowry
mamma
says
hide
there
they
probably
wont
come
in
there
theyll
ask
something
say
something
and
leave
she
says
well
tell
them
that
we
live
alone
here
i
cant
imagine
that
my
parents
will
stand
out
in
the
hall
alone
talking
with
some
sort
of
beasts
i
go
to
them
and
say
that
ill
stand
together
with
them
ill
talk
with
them
if
they
come
maybe
i
can
find
a
common
language
with
them
all
the
more
so
if
they
know
me
i
speak
azerbaijani
more
or
less
and
i
can
find
out
what
they
want
i
told
marina
and
lyuda
to
hide
under
the
bed
and
my
sister
lyuda
i
cant
remember
if
i
told
her
anything
or
not
then
they
open
the
door
its
like
they
blew
on
it
and
it
broke
and
fell
right
into
the
hall
the
crows
bursts
in
and
starts
to
shout
get
out
of
here
leave
vacate
the
apartment
and
go
back
to
your
armenia
things
like
that
i
tell
them
what
has
happened
speak
calmly
one
of
you
tell
me
calmly
what
has
happened
in
azerbaijani
they
say
get
out
of
the
apartment
leave
i
say
ok
go
downstairs
well
gather
everything
we
need
and
leave
the
apartment
i
realize
that
it
is
senseless
to
discuss
any
sort
of
rights
with
them
these
are
animals
they
must
be
stopped
the
ones
standing
in
the
doorway
the
young
guys
say
there
are
old
people
and
one
girl
with
them
too
bad
they
take
two
or
three
steps
back
it
seems
as
though
i
have
pacified
them
with
our
exchange
then
someone
in
the
courtyard
shouts
commanding
them
dont
you
understand
what
you
are
saying
kill
them
and
that
was
it
that
was
all
it
took
they
grab
papa
carry
him
into
one
room
and
mamma
and
me
into
another
they
put
mamma
on
the
bed
and
start
undressing
her
beating
her
legs
they
start
tearing
my
clothes
right
there
in
front
of
mamma
i
dont
remember
where
they
went
what
they
did
or
how
much
time
passed
i
had
the
feeling
that
they
beat
me
on
the
head
on
my
body
and
tore
my
clothes
all
at
the
same
time
i
dont
even
know
what
i
said
the
atrocities
started
i
was
savagely
raped
in
that
room
they
argued
among
themselves
who
would
go
first
later
i
remember
i
came
to
i
dont
know
if
im
dead
or
alive
someone
comes
in
someone
tall
i
think
cleanshaven
in
an
eskimo
dogskin
coat
balding
he
looks
around
at
whats
happening
at
that
instant
everything
stops
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
either
their
commander
or
that
somehow
everything
depends
on
him
he
looks
and
says
well
were
done
here
they
are
beating
mamma
on
the
head
they
break
up
the
chairs
and
beat
her
with
the
chair
legs
she
loses
consciousness
and
they
decide
that
shes
dead
papa
was
out
cold
they
want
to
throw
lyuda
off
the
balcony
but
they
cant
get
the
window
open
apparently
the
window
frames
are
stuck
after
the
rain
and
the
windows
cant
be
opened
they
leave
her
next
to
the
window
she
was
thinking
about
being
thrown
out
the
window
and
passed
out
shes
not
a
real
strong
person
anyway
he
looks
at
me
and
sees
that
im
saying
something
that
im
still
twitching
well
i
start
saying
the
opposite
of
what
i
should
be
which
is
humbling
myself
and
pleading
i
start
shouting
cursing
they
dont
get
any
entreaty
out
of
me
i
already
know
that
im
dead
why
would
i
humble
myself
before
anyone
and
he
says
that
if
thats
what
i
think
since
my
tongue
is
so
long
maybe
he
thinks
that
i
still
look
quite
appealing
in
short
he
commands
that
i
be
taken
outside
i
no
longer
saw
or
remembered
what
was
happening
to
marina
and
lyuda
i
dont
know
if
they
are
alive
or
not
they
take
me
outside
they
are
dragging
me
by
my
arms
by
my
legs
they
are
hitting
me
against
the
wall
the
railings
something
metal
while
they
are
carrying
me
someone
is
biting
me
someone
else
is
pinching
me
i
dont
even
know
i
think
my
god
when
will
death
come
if
only
it
were
sooner
then
they
carry
me
out
throw
me
near
the
entryway
and
start
kicking
me
i
lose
consciousness
what
happened
after
that
how
many
people
there
were
i
dont
remember
i
come
to
after
a
while
i
dont
remember
how
long
a
neighbor
is
bringing
me
clothing
im
entirely
covered
with
blood
she
puts
a
dress
on
me
i
remember
that
i
said
the
same
words
over
and
over
again
mamma
what
happened
mamma
what
have
they
done
to
us
where
are
we
whose
house
are
we
at

papa
i

marina
lyuda

and
while
they
are
dragging
marina
out
she
decides
shes
going
to
tell
them

azerbaijani
igor
immediately
grabs
marinas
and
lyudas
hands
because
he

armenian
and
is
our
sister
and
takes
her
to
the
second

open
up
she
opens
the
door
and
igor
pushes
them
in

so
they
survived
my
sister
lyuda
lost
consciousness
after
the
bandits
started
stealing
things
while
they
were
going
downstairs
taking
things
downstairs
then
coming
back
up
again
lyuda
seized
the
opportunity
and
crawled
under
the
bed
and
stayed
there
then
when
she
was
herself
again
she
found
a
torn
night
shirt
and
put
it
on
and
some
sort
of
robe
and
went
to
a
neighbors
on
the
fourth
floor
the
one
whose
apartment
i
had
watched
the
crowd
from
the
friend
of
ours
and
knocked
on
the
door
the
neighbor
opened
and
said
im
not
going
to
let
you
in
the
apartment
because
im
afraid
of
them
but
ill
give
you
some
stockings
and
well
leave
the
building
lyuda
says
ill
stay
at
your
place
because
of
whats
going
on
they
keep
going
up
and
down
the
stairs
it
was
just
for
a
moment
just
a
moment
in
life
but
the
neighbor
wouldnt
consent
lyuda
came
back
to
our
place
and
lay
under
the
bed
i
came
to
mother
was
there
i
cant
remember
my
supervisors
telephone
number
but
something
had
to
be
done
somehow
i
remembered
and
called
and
he
came
to
get
us
he
didnt
have
any
idea
what
was
going
on
he
thought
we
were
simply
afraid
he
didnt
know
that
they
were
killing
us
and
that
we
had
passed
between
life
and
death
he
came
and
got
us
and
took
us
to
the
police
precinct
there
they
looked
us
over
i
was
having
trouble
walking
my
lungs
hurt
badly
it
was
hard
to
breathe
my
supervisors
name
is
urshan
feyruzovich
mamedov
hes
the
head
of
our
administration
they
took
us
there
when
we
were
leaving
i
saw
a
great
number
of
buses
full
of
soldiers
at
the
entrance
to
town
the
buses
were
ordinary
passenger
buses
there
were
very
many
soldiers
we
left
around
eleven
right
after
eleven
if
these
people
could
stop
what
was
happening
they
could
save
a
great
many
lives
because
the
crowd
was
moving
on
toward
the
school
and
what
was
going
on
there
i
think
everyone
know
not
only
in
sumgait
not
only
in
yerevan
because
there
they
murdered
them
all
one
after
the
next
without
stopping
after
us
i
think
people
died
in
microdistrict
no
and
to
of
them
were
from
buildings
and
in
our
building
one
person
died
and
one
old
woman
died
from
building
thats
the
building
in
front
of
ours
there
young
azerbaijani
men
stopped
the
mob
and
wouldnt
let
it
into
their
building
incidentally
when
we
were
at
the
neighbors
marina
called
our
relatives
to
warn
them
so
they
would
all
know
what
was
happening
i
called
a
aunt
in
microdistrict
no
they
have
three
neighbors
who
are
armenians
i
said
run
quickly
i
cant
explain
whats
going
on
hide
do
what
you
can
just
stay
alive
hide
at
azerbaijanis
ones
who
wont
give
you
away
at
that
moment
three
people
came
in
policemen
i
think
they
were
azerbaijanis
i
was
in
such
awful
condition
my
face
was
completely
distorted
my
lips
were
puffed
up
there
was
blood
my
eye
was
swollen
no
one
thought
i
would
ever
see
anything
out
of
that
eye
again
my
forehead
was
badly
cut
and
onehalf
of
my
face
was
pushed
out
forward
no
one
would
have
thought
that
i
would
survive
get
my
normal
appearance
back
and
be
able
to
grasp
anything
at
all
i
started
to
scream
at
those
people
why
did
you
come
who
sent
you
here
no
one
wants
you
here
havent
you
killed
people
people
yet
what
are
you
doing
here
one
of
the
soldiers
said
dont
scream
at
us
were
muslims
but
were
not
from
the
sumgait
police
they
called
in
from
daghestan
so
at
that
point
the
daghestan
police
were
there
when
we
got
to
the
police
precinct
there
were
an
awful
lot
of
police
there
there
were
soldiers
police
with
dogs
ambulances
firemen
i
dont
know
maybe
they
were
waiting
for
people
to
bring
them
the
goners
and
the
seriously
injured
to
treat
them
there
in
the
police
precinct
i
dont
know
what
they
were
there
for
there
were
also
doctors
from
baku
there
they
examined
lyuda
and
me
and
said
these
women
need
to
go
to
the
maternity
home
but
we
dont
know
what
to
do
with
the
rest
so
they
took
us
and
i
lost
contact
with
my
parents
my
boss
everyone
my
boss
said
dont
worry
ill
find
you
no
matter
where
you
are
no
matter
what
happens
we
went
to
the
hospital
there
we
were
examined
by
a
department
head
from
the
sumgait
maternity
home
pashayeva
i
think
her
name
was
she
examined
us
the
ambulance
was
from
baku
i
figured
out
that
the
sumgait
ambulances
hadnt
done
anything
they
didnt
respond
to
any
calls
people
called
and
neither
the
police
nor
the
ambulances
showed
any
sign
of
life
that
doctor
looked
me
over
and
i
could
tell
from
her
behavior
that
something
very
good
had
happened
for
she
became
quite
glad
i
even
thought
to
myself
god
can
it
be
that
nothing
all
that
bad
is
wrong
she
looks
me
over
and
says
now
why
are
you
suffering
so
you
dont
know
what
your
people
have
been
doing
your
people
did
even
worse
things
and
i
think
great
i
have
to
deal
with
her
and
i
felt
so
bad
i
thought
why
dont
i
just
die
so
as
not
to
have
to
hear
more
stuff
like
this
from
people
like
her
here
i
am
in
this
condition
and
being
told
about
something
that
our
people
did
i
just
didnt
have
the
energy
to
say
how
could
our
people
possibly
be
smart
enough
to
think
of
something
that
yours
havent
already
done
i
stayed
there
then
they
brought
in
another
woman
ira
b
she
was
married
and
she
was
raped
in
her
own
apartment
too
there
were
three
of
us
ira
lyuda
and
the
next
morning
they
took
lyuda
and
ira
away
they
didnt
do
anything
to
help
us
this
was
in
the
old
maternity
home
in
the
combined
block
they
didnt
do
anything
more
than
examine
me
that
was
it
i
didnt
want
any
shots
or
tranquilizer
nothing
what
shots
could
have
calmed
me
down
i
didnt
even
want
to
look
at
them
i
lay
in
the
ward
either
it
just
worked
out
that
way
or
they
did
it
on
pur
pose
but
i
was
alone
i
was
alone
even
though
the
wards
were
packed
that
same
evening
a
woman
came
by
and
asked
me
what
was
wrong
with
me
that
my
face
was
disfigured
she
asked
what
had
happened
to
me
and
i
said
better
to
ask
your
brother
what
happened
theres
no
point
in
asking
me
your
brother
can
better
explain
what
happened
she
fell
into
a
faint
all
the
doctors
threw
themselves
at
her
and
the
doctor
categorically
forbade
anyone
to
come
into
my
ward
then
people
from
work
came
to
see
me
my
boss
his
daughter
they
brought
me
clothing
because
i
was
literally
naked
the
only
thing
i
had
on
was
a
dress
but
the
woman
who
gave
it
to
me
was
very
short
and
the
dress
was
way
up
above
my
knees
and
the
woman
orderly
said
i
cant
believe
you
put
on
such
a
short
dress
who
are
you
showing
off
your
legs
to
here
i
went
back
to
my
ward
thinking
just
one
more
thing
from
something
people
from
work
came
and
brought
me
something
in
a
sack
apples
i
think
three
or
four
pounds
but
i
couldnt
take
them
i
had
become
so
weak
that
it
was
just
embarrassing
i
said
that
i
couldnt
take
the
apples
and
really
didnt
have
any
appetite
no
one
had
to
bring
me
anything
some
woman
took
the
sack
and
oh
yes
then
i
heard
that
the
head
doctor
tell
a
nurse
that
my
medical
history
should
be
hidden
or
torn
up
completely
so
that
no
one
would
know
that
i
was
an
armenian
maybe
they
wouldnt
figure
it
out
from
looking
at
me
so
they
must
have
been
thinking
that
there
would
be
some
kind
of
attack
that
something
else
would
happen
that
it
would
be
worse
or
perhaps
someone
was
outside
on
the
street
i
dont
know
in
any
case
i
didnt
sleep
a
wink
that
night
the
next
morning
they
picked
me
up
a
whole
police
detail
put
me
in
a
bus
and
off
we
went
i
didnt
even
know
where
they
were
taking
me
they
took
me
to
the
club
where
the
troops
were
the
very
one
i
was
in
that
illfated
evening
i
got
off
the
bus
near
the
city
party
committee
there
were
a
great
many
troops
tanks
armored
personnel
carriers
the
whole
scene
was
terrible
i
saw
a
few
people
i
knew
there
and
that
calmed
me
a
little
i
had
already
thought
that
i
was
the
only
one
left
so
there
were
five
or
six
of
us
left
in
sumgait
after
that
night
i
still
didnt
know
what
happened
to
my
parents
they
didnt
come
to
see
me
in
the
hospital
and
my
boss
told
me
that
everything
was
fine
i
didnt
know
whether
to
believe
him
or
not
maybe
he
was
just
trying
to
calm
me
down
maybe
something
happened
on
the
way
then
i
went
to
the
club
and
saw
a
lot
of
people
i
knew
they
all
knew
one
another
they
were
all
kissing
each
other
and
asking
what
happened
what
went
on
two
days
later
they
came
to
see
me
from
work
they
were
there
all
the
time
each
day
they
came
showed
interest
and
were
constantly
bringing
me
money
they
did
everything
they
could
of
course
im
most
thankful
to
my
boss
the
only
one
of
my
colleagues
who
didnt
lose
his
presence
of
mind
and
who
didnt
change
his
opinions
neither
before
nor
after
nor
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
no
matter
what
happened
he
constantly
took
an
interest
a
sincere
interest
from
the
heart
then
about
two
days
later
the
secretary
of
the
party
committee
came
not
from
our
party
organization
but
from
the
first
trust
which
ours
is
part
of
comrade
kerimov
a
very
important
figure
in
our
town
he
made
arrangements
with
the
emergency
medical
personnel
to
take
me
away
because
if
i
sat
down
by
myself
i
couldnt
get
up
or
lie
down
again
there
was
something
wrong
with
my
lungs
it
was
hard
to
breathe
they
examined
me
there
several
times
there
i
lay
were
several
doctors
they
all
thought
that
that
it
must
just
be
from
all
the
blows
i
dont
know
they
didnt
diagnose
anything
in
particular
when
i
was
in
the
maternity
home
i
even
asked
i
made
it
a
point
of
insisting
that
they
take
me
to
the
trauma
section
because
i
felt
so
awful
there
was
no
way
something
inside
wasnt
broken
my
ribs
well
they
took
me
there
and
took
xrays
and
said
that
everything
was
fine
there
were
emergency
medical
workers
on
duty
in
the
club
the
mother
of
one
of
marinas
friends
was
there
she
was
the
head
doctor
at
the
sumgait
childrens
clinic
they
had
every
kind
of
antifever
agent
in
the
world
which
was
exactly
what
i
needed
at
that
moment
i
thought
i
said
that
i
was
having
great
difficulty
breathing
i
couldnt
seem
to
get
enough
air
something
was
wrong
with
me
they
put
tight
bandages
around
my
chest
and
waist
later
i
overheard
some
people
saying
that
i
had
been
cut
all
over
i
think
they
just
saw
me
being
all
bandaged
up
and
decided
that
my
breasts
and
face
had
been
cut
but
i
wasnt
cut
they
took
us
to
the
khimik
boarding
house
we
lived
there
a
long
time
soon
appeared
representatives
they
were
agitating
at
first
people
would
not
talk
to
them
and
drove
them
off
one
of
the
armenian
women
shouted
we
demand
that
seidov
come
the
response
was
its
seidov
who
sent
us
seidov
is
the
chairman
of
the
azerbaijani
council
of
ministers
the
woman
said
well
only
see
seidovs
daughter
have
her
come
here
well
do
the
same
things
to
her
that
they
did
to
our
daughters
and
then
well
deal
with
you
agitators
and
so
on
more
of
them
said
have
seidov
himself
come
this
went
on
day
in
day
out
the
agitators
kept
coming
and
coming
this
drove
us
out
of
our
wits
then
people
gradually
started
departing
for
yerevan
because
they
realized
it
was
senseless
to
stay
everything
got
on
our
nerves
the
smell
the
small
children
there
were
children
at
the
sk
club
children
who
had
literally
just
come
out
of
the
maternity
home
what
were
they
doing
in
a
club
that
didnt
even
have
running
water
all
the
time
at
first
we
had
to
pay
to
eat
there
they
even
overcharged
us
as
it
turned
out
on
the
second
day
someone
told
us
that
they
would
bring
us
food
for
free
the
children
were
ill
everything
stank
there
well
imagine
about
people
in
a
small
movie
theater
with
seating
for
no
more
than
you
couldnt
sit
or
lie
down
it
was
impossible
to
even
move
the
stench
was
awful
even
the
smallest
infants
took
ill
overnight
there
i
heard
that
they
were
arriving
seriously
ill
in
yerevan
the
infants
they
have
to
be
washed
they
have
to
be
bathed
not
to
mention
that
we
the
adults
were
ill
and
needed
care
people
were
fainting
right
and
left
i
just
dont
know
everyone
was
crying
everyone
only
the
young
people
the
men
somehow
managed
to
keep
it
together
but
the
women
were
in
a
constant
state
of
panic
it
seemed
to
everyone
that
they
would
come
any
minute
and
kill
and
stab
it
seemed
clear
that
we
had
been
gathered
together
purposely
like
during
the
war
so
that
they
could
burn
the
movie
theater
and
there
wouldnt
be
a
single
armenian
left
then
people
went
up
to
the
attic
i
didnt
see
them
i
only
heard
them
because
i
was
lying
down
and
couldnt
get
up
i
lay
right
on
the
stage
we
had
some
room
there
apparently
they
caught
two
people
with
either
oil
or
gas
i
think
they
wanted
to
burn
the
theater
maybe
someone
saw
them
i
didnt
i
was
in
no
condition
to
open
my
eyes
everyone
was
suspicious
of
everyone
else
they
would
ask
arent
you
an
azerbaijani
i
think
i
saw
you
somewhere
i
think
youre
an
azerbaijani
they
led
out
all
the
men
and
started
letting
them
back
in
by
checking
their
passports
relatives
might
be
covering
for
each
other
half
of
the
people
did
not
have
any
documents
there
were
people
who
had
run
out
of
their
homes
in
nothing
but
a
pair
of
pants
and
slippers
or
wearing
just
a
shirt
not
like
they
should
have
with
their
ids
so
on
the
on
sunday
i
think
the
police
did
nothing
to
help
us
on
monday
everything
resumed
where
it
had
left
off
on
block
they
didnt
spare
a
soul
there
not
children
not
pregnant
women
nobody
they
killed
they
burned
they
hacked
with
axes
just
everything
possible
they
murdered
the
melkumian
family
whom
i
knew
my
mother
worked
with
them
their
daughter
inlaw
went
to
school
with
my
older
sister
they
were
brutally
murdered
only
the
two
daughtersinlaw
survived
by
a
miracle
one
was
able
to
save
herself
she
ran
away
the
neighbors
wouldnt
take
her
in
so
she
ran
about
the
building
until
she
found
refuge
she
was
pregnant
and
had
two
small
children
this
all
continued
on
monday
in
block
on
the
when
the
troops
were
already
in
the
city
they
murdered
people
they
overturned
automobiles
and
they
burned
entire
families
they
say
they
didnt
even
know
for
sure
if
the
people
were
armenians
or
not
i
heard
that
the
lezgins
suffered
too
im
not
sure
myself
i
didnt
see
any
lezgins
who
had
been
injured
they
burned
cars
so
its
very
difficult
now
to
say
exactly
who
died
and
who
didnt
it
was
very
difficult
to
identify
the
corpses
or
rather
what
remained
of
the
corpses
after
they
were
doused
in
gasoline
and
burned
its
all
very
hard
to
imagine
of
course
i
heard
that
many
people
disappeared
without
a
trace
from
the
btz
plant
two
people
including
a
woman
who
worked
the
night
shift
aunt
razmella
who
also
lived
in
microdistrict
they
were
stopping
buses
between
baku
and
sumgait
in
the
evening
people
who
had
been
visiting
baku
were
returning
to
sumgait
and
people
from
baku
were
going
home
from
sumgait
and
there
were
students
too
they
were
simply
savagely
murdered
they
were
stopping
the
buses
the
drivers
immediately
did
what
they
were
told
because
there
was
just
no
other
way
to
deal
with
that
hoard
of
brutally
minded
people
they
stopped
the
buses
dragged
the
armenians
out
and
killed
them
on
the
spot
i
didnt
see
it
myself
but
i
heard
that
they
put
them
all
in
a
pile
so
as
to
burn
them
later
it
was
hard
to
discern
from
the
corpses
well
you
cant
call
them
corpses
you
had
to
figure
out
from
the
ashes
who
it
was
l
heard
that
two
fellows
saved
two
women
one
a
student
ira
g
if
im
not
mistaken
she
was
in
the
hospital
a
long
time
after
that
and
she
still
cant
figure
out
who
saved
her
she
was
also
brutally
raped
and
beaten
and
thrown
onto
a
pile
of
corpses
the
fellow
pulled
her
out
of
that
whole
pile
of
corpses
put
his
coat
on
her
took
her
into
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
city
i
still
cant
imagine
how
he
managed
to
do
that
i
heard
that
from
engels
grigorian
he
knows
her
apparently
well
a
lot
of
people
went
to
that
hospital
anyway
she
was
in
the
hospital
and
singing
a
song
in
armenian
and
they
wrote
the
words
down
and
i
think
he
still
has
that
piece
of
paper
because
he
says
that
a
lot
of
people
now
have
that
song
the
one
she
sang
in
the
hospital
where
she
lay
in
such
bad
shape
they
couldnt
find
the
guy
who
saved
her
he
left
her
in
someones
apartment
and
called
the
ambulance
she
was
in
such
awful
shape
that
probably
like
me
she
couldnt
remember
anyones
face
i
think
that
i
knew
one
of
the
people
who
broke
into
our
house
maybe
i
had
talked
with
him
once
but
i
received
so
many
blows
everything
was
just
knocked
out
of
my
head
i
cant
remember
to
this
day
who
he
was
then
it
seems
i
saw
the
secretary
of
the
directorates
party
organization
where
marina
works
she
goes
to
school
and
works
she
goes
to
night
school
at
azi
and
works
by
day
at
the
khimzashchita
construction
and
installation
administration
im
the
secretary
of
the
komsomol
organization
at
our
administration
and
often
met
with
the
secretaries
of
party
and
komsomol
organizations
we
had
joint
meetings
i
know
them
all
ive
even
talked
with
them
and
he
i
know
is
from
armenia
an
azerbaijani
but
from
armenia
it
became
obvious
that
many
of
those
people
were
azerbaijanis
born
in
armenia
they
took
me
to
various
police
stations
to
the
police
precinct
and
to
the
procuracy
because
the
ussr
procuracy
got
involved
in
the
case
and
i
iden
tified
the
photographs
of
people
who
i
could
more
or
less
recognize
they
showed
me
the
people
who
were
in
our
apartment
theyre
working
on
our
case
but
i
cant
even
recognize
them
although
it
was
proved
that
they
were
the
ones
theyre
processing
it
somehow
they
tell
me
that
they
know
that
someone
held
me
by
the
arm
and
someone
else
held
me
by
the
leg
when
they
were
dragging
me
there
was
someone
else
in
our
apartment
who
did
not
even
touch
me
he
just
stole
a
blanket
and
an
earring
or
something
like
that
all
these
people
all
of
them
as
much
as
ive
heard
about
them
and
seen
them
they
were
all
from
kafan
the
secretary
of
the
party
organization
is
named
najaf
najaf
rzayev
he
was
there
when
everything
started
it
must
have
been
him
because
i
didnt
recognize
anyone
else
in
the
crowd
whom
i
knew
besides
him
all
the
more
since
i
told
him
listen
you
do
something
because
you
know
me
he
turned
away
and
went
toward
the
bedroom
where
marina
was
well
you
couldnt
see
marina
anyway
there
was
such
a
noisy
confusion
of
people
that
you
couldnt
make
out
anyone
all
of
it
flew
right
out
of
my
head
and
then
gradually
i
became
myself
again
at
the
city
party
committee
there
were
military
people
there
i
told
them
what
went
on
and
they
wrote
it
all
down
i
told
them
his
name
on
march
the
secretary
of
our
first
trust
party
organization
the
one
were
part
of
came
to
see
us
his
name
is
najaf
rzayev
i
tell
mamma
if
hes
here
despite
the
fact
that
i
gave
his
name
it
means
that
either
his
alibi
has
been
confirmed
or
probably
that
they
think
im
crazy
not
responsible
for
my
words
he
said
what
did
they
do
to
you
how
awful
myself
i
hid
an
armenian
family
then
after
some
time
goes
by
he
comes
back
again
and
says
something
entirely
different
i
wasnt
at
home
my
family
and
i
went
to
baku
i
said
marina
what
is
he
saying
he
said
something
totally
different
before
after
that
i
didnt
go
to
see
our
procurator
our
case
is
being
handled
by
a
procurator
from
voronezh
fedorov
by
name
fedorov
told
me
that
rzayevs
case
had
just
gotten
to
him
and
there
were
so
names
involved
what
are
they
doing
with
rzayev
did
he
prove
his
alibi
or
not
they
just
think
that
since
i
was
hit
in
the
head
i
cant
say
anything
for
sure
whether
it
was
him
or
not
it
will
be
an
insult
if
he
was
in
our
apartment
and
doesnt
have
to
pay
for
it
but
at
the
same
time
im
afraid
to
say
im
a
hundred
percent
sure
that
it
was
he
because
no
mat
ter
who
i
name
they
tell
me
no
youre
wrong
he
didnt
do
that
that
one
wasnt
there
all
the
faces
have
gotten
mixed
up
in
my
mind
who
did
what
exactly
i
cant
say
when
they
took
me
outside
there
was
a
whole
crowd
there
but
i
didnt
see
it
because
i
had
my
eyes
closed
all
the
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
always
got
it
because
of
my
eyes
people
were
always
hassling
me
for
some
reason
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
my
eyes
are
responsible
when
they
were
beating
my
face
i
thought
they
were
trying
to
put
my
eyes
out
so
i
had
my
eyes
closed
they
took
me
outside
and
started
to
beat
me
a
young
guy
held
my
arms
he
works
at
the
btz
plant
and
right
nearby
across
the
road
from
us
block
is
where
all
this
was
going
on
right
across
the
road
from
us
the
btz
dormitory
is
over
there
thats
where
he
lives
now
hes
in
custody
they
even
have
proved
as
far
as
i
know
that
it
was
he
who
killed
shurik
gambarian
the
clarinet
player
from
the
third
entryway
of
our
building
one
person
in
our
building
was
killed
it
was
that
man
a
guy
comes
by
who
shared
a
room
with
the
guy
who
was
holding
me
he
saw
that
he
was
holding
me
by
the
arms
and
that
he
was
beating
me
but
he
didnt
come
over
he
just
looked
and
then
went
into
the
dormitory
a
while
after
it
was
all
over
people
started
making
announcements
in
town
saying
that
investigators
had
been
summoned
that
guy
went
and
told
them
everything
now
theyve
caught
him
everythings
been
proved
now
evidently
theyve
been
beating
him
i
dont
know
what
theyre
doing
with
them
over
there
but
he
himself
said
that
he
was
working
the
night
shift
at
the
plant
some
young
guy
came
to
the
plant
and
said
everyone
who
wants
to
kill
armenians
come
to
the
bus
station
on
saturday
at
ten
that
was
it
he
said
the
ones
who
wanted
to
went
this
was
at
the
btz
plant
during
the
night
shift
probably
late
friday
night
it
was
at
night
they
were
at
the
sauna
together
and
he
said
what
do
you
mean
do
you
understand
what
you
are
saying
the
others
were
silent
probably
in
their
hearts
they
were
thinking
im
going
to
go
but
they
didnt
say
anything
to
one
another
he
said
that
he
thought
it
important
to
to
go
because
he
had
heard
a
lot
about
what
had
happened
in
kafan
that
they
had
killed
their
azerbaijani
sisters
their
mothers
burned
villages
and
all
of
that
that
guy
was
also
born
in
kafan
that
is
certain
and
marina
says
that
the
secretary
of
the
party
organization
is
from
armenia
too
from
ive
participated
in
the
investigation
a
couple
of
times
im
satisfied
with
them
thus
far
they
summoned
us
and
asked
about
what
happened
and
every
word
i
said
was
recorded
i
met
some
guy
there
by
the
way
he
was
an
armenian
i
said
that
he
was
in
our
apartment
but
what
he
did
i
dont
know
his
last
name
was
grigorian
eduard
grigorian
he
s
from
sumgait
from
microdistrict
he
was
sentenced
i
think
to
five
years
not
his
first
time
his
mother
is
russian
i
met
with
him
at
the
kgb
in
baku
at
the
azerbaijani
kgb
they
took
us
there
and
showed
me
photographs
there
were
so
many
photographs
i
think
they
even
photographed
those
people
who
were
caught
at
curfew
and
ive
got
them
all
confused
i
say
the
face
was
about
like
this
the
guy
in
the
white
coat
with
the
red
clasps
but
he
could
take
that
coat
off
and
burn
it
somewhere
and
it
would
be
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
well
this
guy
grigorian
i
said
he
was
in
our
apartment
but
he
is
so
lightcomplected
that
he
looks
like
a
lezgin
i
dont
know
what
he
did
i
cant
remember
maybe
he
beat
me
or
raped
me
but
he
was
in
our
apartment
at
the
kgb
he
started
asking
me
pleading
with
me
theres
no
need
for
this
all
this
stuff
look
me
in
the
eyes
youre
like
a
sister
to
me
i
took
a
look
at
him
and
thought
my
god
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
have
a
brother
like
you
but
they
were
satisfied
with
my
responses
because
i
said
everything
without
great
certainty
i
was
there
with
mamma
then
lyuda
came
in
but
when
she
came
in
she
got
sick
immediately
she
wanted
to
kill
him
she
crawled
over
the
table
at
him
she
recognized
him
when
she
came
to
lyuda
was
lying
on
the
balcony
the
mob
threw
her
there
and
all
of
them
ran
into
the
bedroom
we
had
all
kinds
of
boxes
with
dishes
in
them
the
dowries
for
all
three
sisters
they
stole
everything
in
the
apartment
leaving
only
small
things
at
that
moment
lyuda
came
to
and
started
remembering
everything
well
seeing
the
faces
hearing
the
voices
two
people
were
saying
they
could
burn
the
apartment
another
says
why
burn
the
apartment
when
ive
got
three
kids
and
no
place
to
live
so
this
guy
was
in
temporary
housing
he
didnt
have
anywhere
to
live
he
was
from
sumgait
they
were
sure
that
they
would
get
the
apartment
besides
the
neighbors
were
azerbaijani
why
should
they
burn
the
apartment
they
might
burn
azerbaijanis
thats
what
they
said
how
did
they
know
there
were
azerbaijanis
there
if
they
just
picked
a
place
thinking
that
armenians
lived
there
we
have
a
list
of
the
residents
for
our
part
of
the
building
our
name
is
in
there
but
how
could
they
know
that
azerbaijanis
lived
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
from
us
so
they
didnt
set
fire
to
our
apartment
i
dont
know
i
was
in
such
bad
shape
that
if
all
of
it
had
come
to
a
halt
when
i
was
outside
if
someone
had
asked
me
what
was
happening
i
would
have
said
that
a
civil
war
was
going
on
well
maybe
not
civil
but
probably
civil
because
when
they
were
beating
me
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
that
all
the
neighbors
were
standing
on
their
balconies
and
watching
like
at
a
free
horror
film
so
a
civil
war
was
going
on
and
only
the
armenians
were
being
fought
if
it
were
a
world
war
or
something
like
that
they
would
have
been
fighting
everyone
but
they
only
fought
us
then
i
met
some
women
from
our
building
some
azerbaijanis
they
are
crying
they
tell
me
karina
we
saw
all
of
it
how
could
it
happen
theyre
asking
me
well
i
just
dont
know
what
to
call
it
if
a
normal
girl
can
stand
there
and
watch
what
happened
to
me
i
think
that
if
it
were
the
other
way
around
either
i
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
take
it
or
i
would
have
tried
to
avert
it
like
that
one
azerbaijani
woman
did
in
front
of
our
building
a
woman
lives
there
an
awful
dissipated
woman
if
you
can
call
her
a
woman
the
dissipated
life
she
leads
two
armenian
families
live
there
in
her
part
of
the
building
she
came
out
on
the
balcony
and
saw
what
was
happening
to
me
and
started
to
scream
and
curse
she
came
down
to
the
entryway
and
said
youll
come
in
this
entryway
over
my
dead
body
so
not
one
of
them
took
it
in
his
head
to
go
in
that
entryway
some
folks
were
saying
that
those
people
were
so
out
of
control
that
they
didnt
even
know
what
they
were
doing
i
dont
think
thats
true
they
knew
very
well
what
they
were
doing
if
they
didnt
even
lift
a
hand
against
that
woman
they
couldnt
have
cared
less
about
her
but
the
fact
that
she
was
an
azerbaijani
stopped
them
they
were
just
beasts
they
had
smoked
so
much
when
they
came
to
our
place
they
were
all
chewing
something
i
noticed
everyone
who
came
into
the
apartment
was
chewing
something
i
think
my
god
maybe
i
just
think
that
maybe
im
losing
my
mind
but
no
theyre
all
chewing
something
maybe
it
is
some
kind
of
drug
it
must
be
because
at
first
glance
they
all
seemed
to
be
such
normal
people
young
cleanshaven
looking
exactly
as
if
they
had
come
to
some
sort
of
celebration
but
they
were
shouting
something
they
didnt
talk
they
shouted
as
though
there
were
deaf
people
there
they
screamed
and
screamed
yeah
killing
killing
were
killing
the
armenians
only
they
didnt
shout
kill
they
shouted
gurun
ermianlary
gurun
literally
means
kill
or
destroy
thats
how
it
was
ill
continue
we
hid
in
a
captains
apartment
hes
an
azerbaijani
his
wife
is
a
tatar
we
were
sitting
in
their
apartment
their
kids
were
out
in
the
yard
their
kids
knew
a
whole
lot
this
was
in
our
part
of
the
building
on
the
third
floor
when
mamma
came
to
and
couldnt
find
lyuda
she
took
papas
hand
this
was
while
the
looters
were
stealing
things
but
they
didnt
pay
attention
because
they
were
stealing
things
apparently
they
had
already
ceased
killing
and
switched
to
stealing
mamma
found
the
courage
to
a
boy
said
to
my
mother
wheres
the
gold
mamma
said
he
must
have
been
to
years
old
he
even
looked
russian
he
was
so
fairskinned
but
the
azerbaijanis
from
armenia
are
fairskinned
i
noticed
they
were
all
on
the
fair
side
he
shouted
they
were
all
smashing
things
and
he
asks
mamma
where
the
gold
is
we
kept
our
gold
in
the
wardrobe
with
our
important
papers
in
a
little
black
bag
we
kept
everything
in
there
mamma
doesnt
really
like
to
wear
gold
she
probably
never
even
wore
those
things
from
the
time
they
were
bought
for
her
they
took
everything
that
was
lying
on
the
cheval
glass
mamma
thinks
that
the
gold
saved
us
because
they
threw
themselves
at
the
gold
and
mamma
grabbed
papa
who
was
trying
to
breathe
they
had
closed
his
mouth
bound
his
hands
and
put
a
pillow
and
a
chair
on
his
face
they
had
shoved
something
into
his
mouth
so
he
would
suffocate
mamma
grabbed
him
and
tore
all
that
stuff
off
he
had
something
in
his
mouth
he
was
having
trouble
breathing
his
nose
was
filled
with
blood
mamma
grabbed
him
and
started
running
from
the
fifth
down
to
the
first
floor
because
no
one
wanted
to
open
their
doors
to
them
mamma
said
that
by
accident
completely
by
accident
that
person
opened
his
door
he
was
sleeping
and
said
halfawake
whats
happened
he
sees
that
they
are
bloody
mamma
said
at
least
go
and
find
out
whats
happening
to
my
daughters
even
if
theyve
burned
them
or
murdered
them
at
least
bring
the
corpses
he
went
looking
for
us
at
that
moment
lyuda
was
under
the
bed
she
says
that
after
they
left
it
seemed
that
someone
was
calling
her
name
when
he
quietly
called
her
she
couldnt
get
out
from
under
the
bed
she
wanted
to
get
out
and
was
calling
softly
she
thought
she
was
shouting
but
in
fact
she
was
either
silent
or
was
only
talking
to
herself
it
just
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
shouting
when
she
got
out
from
under
the
bed
everyone
was
gone
and
again
she
thought
that
she
had
lost
her
mind
ill
never
leave
here
never
to
hell
with
it
it
just
seems
that
way
to
me
ill
come
to
eventually
but
then
when
everything
had
settled
down
stopped
that
mall
brought
lyuda
down
and
igor
carried
me
in
from
outside
or
first
i
was
brought
in
then
lyuda
i
dont
remember
what
order
it
happened
in
and
mamma
said
listen
theyre
all
running
around
down
there
shouting
something
or
other
and
running
toward
the
other
building
it
had
more
or
less
calmed
down
where
we
were
whos
dead
whos
alive
we
dont
know
i
tried
to
call
my
girlfriend
i
had
basically
come
to
mamma
says
listen
lets
go
upstairs
at
least
get
a
mattress
or
something
we
dont
know
how
long
well
be
here
maybe
they
didnt
burn
everything
i
dont
get
it
all
women
have
that
feeling
they
want
to
get
something
from
their
homes
maybe
not
everything
was
taken
i
tell
mamma
mamma
what
do
you
need
any
of
that
for
to
hell
with
it
were
alive
forget
the
rest
of
it
all
of
it
she
says
no
lets
go
get
at
least
something
maybe
well
leave
here
spend
the
night
at
someone
elses
mamma
went
upstairs
and
their
little
boy
their
son
alik
was
standing
on
the
lookout
lie
was
standing
there
to
see
if
they
were
coming
they
only
managed
to
run
up
there
and
grab
something
one
time
he
shouts
come
back
theyre
coming
they
didnt
have
enough
time
to
get
a
lot
mattresses
from
one
apartment
a
blanket
from
another
mamma
got
my
knitting
someone
managed
to
grab
our
old
things
the
ones
we
never
wore
out
of
the
hall
someone
took
fathers
old
coveralls
the
neighbor
his
wife
mamma
and
papa
marina
went
with
them
i
was
in
no
condition
to
leave
neither
was
lyuda
we
just
sat
they
ran
out
and
we
closed
the
door
and
just
then
we
hear
that
the
mob
is
on
its
way
toward
our
place
upstairs
theyre
dragging
something
again
they
were
going
toward
the
other
building
maybe
over
by
the
school
or
there
was
an
unfinished
building
over
there
people
said
they
were
going
toward
the
basement
or
the
unfinished
building
they
could
gradually
carry
everything
over
there
then
things
more
or
less
calmed
down
i
tried
to
call
my
boss
later
there
was
more
noise
we
were
on
the
third
floor
in
a
onebedroom
apartment
and
a
woman
lives
in
the
onebedroom
place
on
the
second
floor
asya
dallakian
shes
an
old
woman
retired
she
wasnt
at
home
at
that
time
she
was
usually
in
the
country
she
has
a
married
daughter
there
and
her
grandson
is
in
the
army
she
is
only
very
rarely
in
town
she
gets
her
retirement
money
and
the
apartment
is
essentially
vacant
they
started
pounding
on
her
door
and
broke
it
down
she
had
two
or
three
beds
in
there
something
like
that
shes
a
woman
who
really
does
not
even
live
there
probably
she
had
some
pots
a
couple
of
metal
bed
frames
and
mattresses
and
a
television
when
her
grandson
came
she
bought
a
television
they
started
wrecking
everything
i
started
getting
sick
again
i
think
my
god
what
is
going
on
around
here
when
will
this
end
we
turned
off
the
lights
and
sat
as
it
turns
out
the
people
who
werent
afraid
the
ones
who
knew
what
was
going
on
knew
not
to
turn
off
the
lights
we
didnt
know
but
they
didnt
come
to
where
we
were
all
the
same
they
all
knew
very
well
that
he
was
a
captain
he
went
out
and
closed
the
door
and
we
sat
in
his
apartment
his
last
name
was
kasumov
hes
an
exserviceman
retired
works
up
at
the
fire
station
at
some
plant
or
other
he
went
out
and
stood
at
his
door
they
tell
him
comrade
captain
dont
worry
we
wont
harm
you
youre
one
of
us
he
went
upstairs
and
they
say
arent
you
taking
anything
from
this
apartment
he
says
i
dont
need
anything
and
the
women
who
were
standing
in
the
yard
we
have
a
basement
full
of
water
the
women
who
were
standing
in
the
yard
saw
those
guys
they
left
everything
they
stole
on
the
first
floor
and
ran
upstairs
again
the
women
threw
everything
they
had
time
to
into
the
basement
to
save
our
property
some
things
were
left
dirty
pillows
two
or
three
other
things
and
a
rug
a
guy
came
downstairs
really
mad
and
he
says
wheres
the
rug
i
just
put
it
right
here
they
tell
him
some
guy
came
and
took
it
and
went
off
toward
the
school
he
ran
off
in
that
direction
oh
i
forgot
the
most
important
point
when
igor
picked
me
up
in
his
arms
there
were
women
standing
there
who
saw
everything
that
was
going
on
they
just
didnt
tell
me
about
it
for
a
long
time
the
wife
of
that
military
man
she
didnt
want
to
kill
my
spirit
i
was
already
dead
enough
later
she
told
me
that
after
they
murdered
uncle
shurik
in
the
third
entryway
one
of
them
the
ringleader
apparently
a
young
man
said
wheres
the
girl
who
was
here
and
he
became
furious
the
woman
tells
him
she
came
to
she
didnt
know
what
to
say
think
something
up
someone
carried
her
off
then
they
would
comb
the
whole
house
and
find
me
and
our
whole
family
so
the
woman
says
she
came
to
and
went
to
the
basement
now
our
basement
is
full
of
water
so
the
whole
mob
dashes
off
to
the
basement
to
look
for
me
or
my
corpse
they
took
flashlights
they
were
up
to
their
waists
in
water
water
which
had
been
standing
there
for
years
and
soot
and
fuel
oil
they
climbed
down
in
there
to
get
me
then
one
of
them
said
theres
so
much
water
down
there
she
probably
walked
and
walked
and
then
passed
out
and
died
she
met
her
death
in
the
basement
thats
it
we
can
leave
no
problem
i
didnt
know
that
and
when
i
was
told
i
felt
worse
two
times
worse
a
lot
worse
so
they
didnt
just
want
to
pound
me
flat
something
more
awful
was
awaiting
me
after
that
we
of
course
didnt
want
to
live
in
sumgait
any
longer
we
really
didnt
want
to
go
back
to
our
apartment
when
we
moved
i
went
up
there
and
started
to
quiver
and
shake
all
over
because
i
started
remembering
it
all
although
the
neighbors
all
sobbed
it
was
all
so
cheap
the
people
who
sat
in
their
apartments
and
didnt
help
us
at
a
time
like
that
i
think
that
they
could
have
helped
i
dont
think
that
they
were
obligated
to
but
they
could
have
helped
us
because
that
one
woman
was
able
to
stop
that
whole
brutal
crowd
by
herself
that
means
they
could
have
too
it
would
have
been
enough
foe
one
man
or
women
to
say
what
do
you
think
youre
doing
thats
all
that
would
have
done
it
there
were
apartments
in
our
building
not
one
person
said
it
when
i
was
lying
on
the
ground
and
all
those
people
were
standing
on
their
balconies
i
didnt
hear
anyones
voice
no
one
said
what
are
you
doing
leave
her
alone
mamma
even
told
one
of
the
neighbor
women
that
if
it
had
been
an
azerbaijani
woman
in
my
place
they
would
have
dropped
a
bomb
if
it
would
have
killed
even
one
armenian
they
would
have
stood
up
for
one
of
their
own
true
they
say
that
our
neighbor
from
the
fourth
entryway
an
old
sick
woman
tried
to
stop
the
pogrom
the
azerbaijanis
have
a
custom
if
a
woman
takes
her
scarf
and
throws
it
on
the
ground
the
men
are
supposed
to
stop
immediately
the
old
woman
from
the
fourth
entryway
did
that
but
they
stomped
her
scarf
into
the
ground
pushed
her
off
to
the
side
and
said
if
you
want
to
go
on
living
youll
disappear
into
your
apartment
so
she
left
that
trick
didnt
work
on
them
even
the
neighbors
who
helped
us
move
told
me
ok
fine
calm
down
forget
that
it
happened
i
said
id
only
forget
it
if
i
told
them
right
then
that
it
had
happened
to
their
daughterand
if
that
didnt
have
any
effect
on
them
then
i
would
forget
everything
too
imagine
that
it
happened
to
your
sister
and
no
one
did
anything
anything
