synagogues
mosques
and
double
standards

writes
responding
to
a
discussion
about
a
mosque
in
jerusalem
allegedly
having
been
destroyed
by
israel
bc
in
todays
jerusalem
post
magazine
there
is
a
feature
story
about
the
bc
ongoing
restoration
of
synagogues
in
the
jewish
quarter
the
author
bc
leah
abramowitz
writes
that
there
were
fiftyseven
synagogues
in
the
bc
quarter
in
all
of
which
were
destroyed
some
she
says
used
as
bc
donkey
stables
the
building
shells
that
is
bc
bc
i
still
find
it
really
really
hard
to
understand
why
the
demolition
bc
of
the
buildings
in
front
of
the
kotel
continues
to
evoke
more
outrage
bc
than
this
everything
is
so
much
cheaper
when
it
happens
to
the
jews
bc
bc
why
the
double
standard
of
human
behavior
regarding
the
jews
must
be
manitained
a
perfect
example
is
the
outcry
over
the
temporary
removal
of
men
who
advocated
murdering
jews
and
destroying
the
state
of
israel
compared
to
the
deafening
silence
over
the
abusive
treatment
of
jews
in
arab
countries
during
the
past
years
compare
the
tacit
appoval
that
the
world
gives
to
muslims
who
randomly
murder
jewish
civilians
to
the
righteous
indignation
expressed
if
people
in
the
occupied
territories
are
kept
from
working
in
israel
in
an
effort
to
reduce
these
random
murders
from
occuring
while
everyone
knows
that
no
country
is
at
all
required
to
accept
foreign
workers
except
israel
of
course
jewish
blood
has
always
been
cheap
the
nonjewish
world
ha
never
regarded
any
form
of
jewish
suffering
important
except
when
the
jews
were
the
models
of
the
powerless
victim
holding
the
high
moral
ground
as
it
had
been
just
after
world
war
however
as
soon
as
the
jewish
people
started
to
take
care
of
themselves
the
ancient
hatred
of
jews
was
unleashed
again
i
doubt
if
the
nonjewish
world
is
even
capable
of
having
any
compassion
towards
jews
as
antisemitism
is
so
ancient
and
so
basic
to
both
christianity
and
islam
golda
meir
said
that
there
would
be
peace
when
the
arabs
love
their
own
children
more
than
they
hate
the
jews
and
while
i
know
that
there
are
more
arab
parents
who
love
their
children
than
those
who
would
send
their
children
out
into
the
streets
to
throw
rocks
at
men
trained
to
defend
themselves
with
guns
the
world
is
so
obsessed
by
a
hatred
of
jews
trying
to
defend
themselves
that
they
have
yet
to
even
question
the
actions
of
those
parents
who
not
simply
allow
their
children
to
do
this
but
encourage
them
to
throw
themselves
into
harms
way
even
arab
children
are
expendable
if
their
tragic
deaths
are
used
in
the
neverending
propoganda
battle
to
blame
israel
and
the
jews
for
any
misfortune
befalling
arabs
in
the
middle
east
who
is
a
jew
a
person
whose
integrity
decays
when
unmoved
by
the
knowledge
of
wrong
done
to
other
people
