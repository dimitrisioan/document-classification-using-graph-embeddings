IN
ARTICLE
ANDI
BEYER
WRITES
A
FEW
THINGS
ABOUT
THE
UNIVERSITY
WHY
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
TO
GO
INTO

IT
IS
MORE
FUN
THAN
SOME
MAY
ADMIT
PARTYING
DOES
GO

IT
HAS
CONSISTENTLY
BEEN
RANKED
ONE
OF
PLAYBOYS
TOP
PARTY
SCHOOLS
ESPECIALLY
THIS
RIVETTING
PIECE
OF
INFORMATION
BUT
WE
DO
STUDY
AND
MORE
IMPORTANTLY
LEARN
A
LOT
THE
OVERALL
UVA
DRUG
USE
IS
ACTUALLY
LOWER
THAN
THE
AVERAGE
COLLEGE
IN
THE
US
THERE
IS
NO
HATE
LAW
ON
THE
BOOKS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
THE
FORCES
OF
PC
TRIED
TO
HAVE
ONE
LAST
YEAR
BY
THE

A
SIMILAR
LAW
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF

WAS
FOUND
UNCONSTITUTIONAL
LAST

AS
I
REMEMBER
SOMEONE
DID
ASK
IF
UV
HAD
A
SPEACH
CODE
BUT
REALLY
THERE
IS
NO
NEED
FOR
THIS
BRIEF
SURVEY
COURSE
THERE
IS
A
LAW
AGAINST
RELATIONSHIP
OF
PROFESSORS
WITH
THEIR
STUDENTS
OR
ADVISEES
THAT
JUST
PASSED
THOMAS
JEFFERSON
WAS
THE
SOLE
AUTHOR
OF
THE
VIRGINIA
STATUTE
FOR
RELIGIOUS
FREEDOMTHE
BASIS
FOR
THE
FIRST
TEN
AMENDMENTS
THOUGH
HE
IS
NOT
GIVEN
FULL
CREDIT
FOR
RIGHTING
THE

OF
RIGHTS
