you
think
she
meant
that

does
it
actually
mean

not
appear

you

for
what
he
had
been
promised
from
a
time
as
ancient
as
biblical
to
the
time
of
the

just
a

short

back

what
was
thought
of

terrorism
by

didnt
include
slaughtering
olympic

brutally
murdering

innocent
attacking
school

murdering

for
the
sole
reason
that
he

the

there
were
serious
concerns
about

from

it
is
a
wise
to

a

what

quite
visionary

deeply
believe
in
launching

against

without

hesitation
by

nearly
forty

dead

it
should
be
obvious
to
anybody
that
if
israel
was
expansionist
it
would
have
annexed
the
occupied
territories
right
after
it
captured
them
israel
would
not
be
negotiating
to
get
rid
of
them
ed
during
the
last
years
our
people
have
been
in
a
ed
process
of
building
up

additional

additional

violence
directed
at
innocent
people
that
began
in
with

of
