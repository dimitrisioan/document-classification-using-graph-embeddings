anas
there
are
many
neutral
human
rights
organizations
which
always
report
anas
on
the
situation
in
the
ot
but
as
most
people
used
to
see
on
tv
the
anas
israelis
do
not
allow
them
to
go
deep
there
in
the
ot
the
israelis
anas
used
to
arrest
and
sometimes
to
kill
some
of
these
neutral
reporters
anas
so
this
is
another
kind
of
terrorism
committed
by
the
jews
in
palestine
anas
they
do
not
allow
fair
and
neutral
coverage
of
the
situation
in
anas
palestine
bring
me
one
case
where
israeli
soldiers
deliberately
killed
a
neutral
reporter
this
is
another
one
of
your
wet
dreams
unlike
many
countries
israel
does
allow
reporters
in
and
out
of
the
ot
that
is
what
the
problem
is
if
israel
were
a
country
like
china
then
nothing
would
transpire
from
what
is
happening
in
the
ot
but
there
seems
to
be
a
proliferation
of
journalists
in
israel
always
trying
to
show
how
evil
the
israeli
monster
is
arab
countries
dont
allow
journalists
anywhere
we
have
yet
to
hear
about
the
massacres
of
kurds
the
destruction
and
annihilation
of
hama
the
killings
of
moslem
fundamentalists
in
mosques
in
egypt
and
algeria
etc
why
is
it
we
only
get
state
reports
how
accurate
are
they
anas
go
give
a
lesson
of
freedom
of
speech
to
your
arab
bretheren
before
telling
us
what
to
do
