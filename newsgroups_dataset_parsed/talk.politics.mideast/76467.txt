you
make

sound

about

go

about
the
atrocities
commited
by
the
turks
against
the
greeks
during
the
period
of
time
greece
was
occupied
by
the
turks
now
you
expect
that
turks
living
in
greece
should
be
treated
like
so
the
greek
educational
system
is
also
in
a
shambles
history
shows
that
within
the
last
years
greeks
played
that
game
twice
they
used
istanbul
patriarch
grigorios
in
to
instigate
the
morea
rebellion
that
resulted
in
the
massacres
of

the
disintegration
of
the
ottoman
empire
which
had
been
going
on
for
a
century
was
disastrous
for
ottoman
jewry
this
was
the
age
of
nationalism
among
the

subjects
of
the
sultan
starting
with
the
greek
revolution
early
in
the
nineteenth

themselves
stimulated
similar
uprisings
among
the
other
subjects
in
southeastern
europe
who
had
long
been
oppressed
not
so
much
by
the
ottomans
but
rather
by
the
greek
religious
hierarchy
which
dominated
the
orthodox
millet
leading
first
to
pressure
for
religious
independence
granted
to
the

orthodox
exarchate

they
new

were
greatly
assisted
in
their
campaigns
against
the
ottomans
both
by
the
diplomatic
and
consular
representatives
of
the
major
powers
of
europe
and
also
by
christian
missionaries
who
emphasized
feelings
of
christian
superiority
and
hatred
for
muslims
and
jews
which
fortified
the
religious
as
well
as
ethnic
bases
of
their
pursuit
of
independence
christian
nationalism
based
as
much
on
religious
as
on
ethnic
identity
soon
resurrected
the
medieval
bigotries
which
had
devastated
both
jews
and
muslims
and
consequently
had
driven
them
together
in
the
past
vicious
antimuslim
and
antisemitic
movements
developed
involving
largescale
persecutions
and
massacres
carried
out
by
invading
armies
by
the
independent
states
that
resulted
also
by
christian
subjects
who
remained
within
the
empire
particularly
because
of
jewish
and
muslim
support
for
ottoman
integrity
in
fear
of
their
fate
in
the
emergent
nationalist
states
of
southeastern

the
results
were
explosive
and

the
invading
armies
of

and
austria
as
well
as
the
revolting
nationalists
and
later
successfully

throughout

nineteenth

contrary

page
as
the
peoples
of
southeastern
europe
achieved
their
independence
their
muslim
and
jewish
minorities
were
systematically
persecuted
and
massacred
and
those
who
survived
were
driven
beyond
the
evershrinking
boundaries
of
the
retreating
ottoman
empire
in
a
kind
of
slaughter
which
had
not
been
seen
since
the
dispersal
of
the
jews
from
palestine
centuries
earlier
this
sort
of
genocide
had
begun
as
long
before
as
the
late
sixteenth
century
with
the
rumanian
principalities
taking
the
lead
as
united
rumania
did
subsequently
during
the
later
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
ruler
of
moldavia
peter
the
lame
banished
its
jews
because
of
their
competition
with
its
christian
merchants
when
prince
micheal
the

revolted
against
the
ottomans
in
the
rumanian
principalities
of
wallachia
and
moldavia
in
he
ordered
the
massacre
of
all
the
jews
as
well
as
turks
in
bucharest
page
the
slaughter
continued
well
into
the
nineteenth
century
when
the
greeks
revolted
against
ottoman
rule
many
greek
volunteers
coming
from
russia
and
the
principalities
to
join
in
the
effort
slaughtered
and
plundered
the
jewish
communities
along

paths
as
they
went
through
moldavia
and
wallachia
toward
greece
page

paragraph
when

island
of

jewish
population
was
either
massacred
or
deported
and
all
jewish
communal
and
personal
property

paragraph
jews
living
in
greece
and
the
rumanian
principalities
suffered
terribly
because
of
their
support
for
ottoman
rule
when
the
greek
nationalist
movement
philike
etairia
started
its
uprising
in
wallachia
and
moldavia
during
the
spring
of
hundreds
of
jews
and
muslims
were
killed
by
the
greeks
who
lived
there
as
well
as
by
native
wallachs
during
the
height
of
the
greek
revolution
five
thousand
jews
were
massacred
in
morea
along
with
most
of
the
muslim
population
numbering
about
twenty
thousand
in
all
in
tripolizza
alone
jews
were
massacred
along
with
uncounted
turks
reverend
john
hartley
after
describing
the
carnage
concluded
thus
did
jewish
blood
mingled
with
turkish
flow
down
the
streets
of
captured
city
the
sons
of
isaac
and
the
sons
of
ishmael
on
this
as
well
as
on
every
occasion
during
the
greek
revolution
met
with
common
fate
their
corpses
were
cast
out
of
the
city
and
like
the
ancient
sovereign
of
judah
they
received
no
burial
superior
to
that
of
an
ass
jewish
communities
on
the
islands
of
sparta
patras
corinthos
mistra
and
argos
were
wiped
out
by
bands
of
greek
rebels
along
with
those
of
thebes
vrachori
attica
and
epirus
the
surviving
jews
fled
to
the
island
of
corfu
where
jews
who
had
fled
from
italy
and
the
iberian
peninsula
had
lived
in
peace
and
prosperity
under
the
venetian
rule
since
the
twelfth
century
though
divided
into
rival
greek
and
italian
communities
it
was
not
long
however
before
it
too
fell
victim
to
the
greek
revolution
leading
to
savage
repression
and
massacres
of
jews
forcing
the
surviving
members
of
the
two
communities
to
come
together
for
selfdefense
for
the
first
time
throughout
the
years
of
greek
revolution
greek
nationalists
went
from
town
to
town
on
the
mainland
and
from
island
to
island
in
the
agean
exterminating
all
the
jews
and
muslims
they
could
find
many
along
the
roads
as
they
desperately
fled
to
safety
in
what
was
left
of
the
ottoman
empire
contemporary
accounts
relate
that
the
greeks
left
the
murdered
jews
and
muslims
lying
exposed
so
their
bodies
could
be
torn
apart
by
the
buzzards
most
of
the
jews
who
survived
these
massacres
fled
across
the
agean
in
small
boats
to
izmir
thus
starting
its
rise
as
one
of
the
leading
centers
of
ottoman
jewish
life
during
the
nineteenth
century
only
in
northern
greece
particularly
in
the
areas
of
janina
and
salonica
were
the
jews
and
the
turks
able
to
successfully
resist
the
greek
assaults
thus
saving
their
populations
from
massacre
as
well
during
the
remainder
of
the
century
particularly
during
the
greekturkish
war
in
those
jews
who
remained
in
greece
in
the
areas
of
athens
chalkis
larissa
corfu
and
crete
suffered
severe
persecution
and
massacre
forcing
thousands
more
to
emigrate
into
ottoman
territory
particularly
to
salonica
and
izmir
page
last
paragraph
the
inclusion
in
the
treaty
of
berlin
of
stipulations
providing
protection
for
the
jewish
and
muslim
minorities
in
southeastern
europe
stimulated
more
popular
antisemitic
and
antimuslim
hysteria
in
all
the
countries
involved
with
bloodlibel
accusations
once
again
being
used
as
pretexts
for
attacking
and
ravaging
jewish
quarters
as
well
as
for
new
tactics
for
boycotting
jewish
shopkeepers
merchants
and
professionals
a
movement
which
was
quickly
adapted
by
the
christian
millets
in
the
major
cities
of
the
ottoman
empire
because
the
bulgarians
rumanians
and
greeks
correctly
regarded
the
jews
as
supporters
of
the
turks
both
jews
and
turks
were
expelled
from
these
countries
in
equally
atrocious
and
brutal
manners
their
property
was
plundered
and
their
homes
and
shops
taken
over
without
compensation
while
the
survivors
fled
in
desperation
to
edirne
and
istanbul
while
official
statements
subsequently
were
issued
granting
equal
rights
to
jews
little
was
done
in
fact
and
they
continued
to
be
persecuted
regularly
well
into
the
twentieth
century
page
last
paragraph
things
were
not
much
better
elsewhere
in
southeastern
europe
or
the
greek
islands
of
the
agean
and
the
eastern
mediterranean
in
the
jews
on
corfu
were
subjected
to
severe
persecution
by
local
greeks
due
to
the
revival
of
the
old
ritual
murder
accusations
many
of
those
who
survived
found
refuge
in
ottoman
territory
with
the
help
of
a
popular
subscription
drive
carried
out
in
istanbul
under
leadership
of
the
banque
camondo
in
and
and
again
in
and
thousands
of
jews
came
to
ottoman
territory
as
a
result
of
pogroms
in
russia
which
went
on
between
and
with
only
slight
periods
of
respite
in
jewish
families
arrived

by
greek
and

forces

wars
including
salonica

was
followed
by
general
attacks
on
jews
their
synagogues
homes
and
shops
in
both
countries
resulting
in
a
renewed
exodus
toward
istanbul
and
beyond
two
reports
from
salonica
graphically
described
the
situation
caused
by
the
invading
armies
all
the
selfinterested
justifications
of
the
newspapers
of
europe
all
the
lies
which
they
have
used
to
cover
up
the
truth
can
never
destroy
the
impression
of
the
terrible
anguish
which
has
marked
the
entry
of
the
greeks
in
salonica
a
week
of
terror
and
horror
one
can
never
easily
forget
the
hellenes
now
cruelly
feel
today
all
the
damage
that
the
explosion
of
hatred
by
the
greek
population
has
done
to
their
cause
the
mob
has
shown
itself
odious
and
the
government
weakthe
incompetence
of
the
greek
administration
and
the
horrors
inflicted
by
the
soldiers
has
put
them
in
a
terrible
situation
the
consuls
guaranteed
the
absolute
safety
of
the
muslims
but
sixty
of
them
were
massacred
in
a
single
it
wasnt
only
irregulars

who
massacred
pillaged
and
burned

in
the
events
at

out
of

almost
shops
were
consumed

the

lost
all
and
without
even
anything
to
wear
is
in
despair
everyone
wants

result
of
these
