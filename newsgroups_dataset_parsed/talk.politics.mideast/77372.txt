was
fleeing

much
of

in

in

below

had
been
searched
for

by
the

everything
had

cloak

not

had
many
moslems
been

horrible
tortures
had
been
inflicted
in

endeavour

obtain
information
as

where

existence

first
paragraph
the
armenians
from
the
plain
were
attacking
the
kurdish
line
with
artillery

probably
a
large
force

p
first
paragraph
the
arrival
of
this
british

was
followed
by
the
announcement
that
kars
province
had
been
allotted
by
the
supreme
council
of

to
the
armenians

that
announcement

completely
withdrawn

commenced
the
wholesale
robbery

it
was
necessary
forcibly
to
deprive
them
of

were
