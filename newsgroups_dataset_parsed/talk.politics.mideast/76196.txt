NETANYAHU
ON
CNN
TONIGHT
IN
ARTICLE
NABILNCRCOLCOLUMBIASCNCRCOM
NABILIDRISS
WRITES
ARAB
LEADERS
DONT
HAVE
TO
CHEAT
THEY
ARE
ACTUALLY
ALLOWED
TO
HAVE
FOUR
WIVES
ARE
YOU
IMPLYING
ABOVE
THAT
ARAB
LEADERS
ARE
GAYS
ARENT
THERE
JEWISH
GAYS
TOO
ARAB
LEADERS
ARE
NOW
FOLLOWING
BY
ISLAMIC
RULES
OR
IS
IT
ONLY
APPLICABLE
IN
CASES
LIKE
THIS
I
REMEMBER
AN
ARTICLE
OF
ABOUT
A
YEAR
AGO
WHICH
STATED
THAT
BESIDES
HIS
WIFE
SADDAM
ALSO
HAS
A
MISTRESS
ASSADS
BROTHER
HAS
A
WIFE
AND
SEVERAL
MISTRESSES
AND
THOSE
EMIRS
IN
THE
GULF
HAVE
WITHIN
THEIR
LIFETIMES
WIVES
IN
THE
DOUBLE
DIGITAS
ONLY
THEY
MANAGE
TO
KEEP
FOUR
AT
A
TIME
THIS
IS
ALL
IRRELEVANT
IT
TAKES
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
INFIDELITY
TO
MAKE
THESE
LEADERS
RUTHLESS
AND
CORRUPT
MAYBE
NETANYAHU
THOUGHT
HE
COULD
CLEANSE
HIMSELF
BY
MAKING
SUCH
A
PUBLIC
CONFESSION
DOES
THE
AVERAGE
SECULAR
ISRAELI
CARE
THOUGH
THE
MOSSAD
PROBABLY
APPLAUDED
HIM
