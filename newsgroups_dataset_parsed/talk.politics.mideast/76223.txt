re
israels
expansion
ii
writes
the
comparison
of
the
palestinian
situation
with
the
holocaust
is
insulting
and
completely
false
any
person
making
such
a
rude
and
false
comparison
is
either
ignorant
of
the
holocaust
or
also
ignorant
of
the
situation
in
the
mideast
or
is
an
antisemite
to
compare
a
complicated
political
situation
with
the
genocide
of
jews
is
racist
in
and
of
itself
first
of
all
i
never
said
the
holocaust
i
said
before
the
holocaust
im
not
ignorant
of
the
holocaust
and
know
more
about
nazi
germany
than
most
people
maybe
including
you
what
i
resent
is
ignorant
statements
that
call
people
names
when
they
disagree
with
your
position
opposing
the
atrocities
commited
by
the
israeli
governement
hardly
qualifies
as
antisemitism
if
you
think
name
calling
is
a
valid
form
of
argument
in
intellectual
circles
you
need
to
get
out
more
often
i
dont
think
the
suffering
of
some
jews
during
wwii
justifies
the
crimes
commited
by
the
israeli
government
any
attempt
to
call
civil
liberterians
like
myself
antisemetic
is
not
appreciated
