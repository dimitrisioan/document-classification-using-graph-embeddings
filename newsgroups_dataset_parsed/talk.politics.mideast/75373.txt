about

kicking

out
we
rather
deam
of

everybody
converts
if
jews
had
the
same
dream
i
would
not
feel
threatened
a
bit
there
certainly
are
muslims
who
do
not
believe
that
their
dream
of
a
global
islamic
community
should
be
achieved
through
force
there
are
however
others
and
they
are
often
far
more
visiblevocal
than
the
former
who
do
accept
the
establishment
of
global
islam
through
force
i
would
not
feel
threatened
by
those
only
accepting
or
pursuing
islamicization
through
peaceful
means
nor
by
jews
advocating
the
same
approach
those
advocating
force
as
a
means
of
expanding
their
sides
power
are
certainly
a
threat
to
palestinians
israel
is
doing
just
that
maintaining
its
dominance
of
those
outside
its
own
group
if
i
am
told
that
i
am
not
one
of
you
but
you
then
impose
your
control
on
me
damn
right
you
are
a
threat
if
i
am
a
member
of
a
nonmuslim
minority
inside
the
islamic
world
and
actively
did
not
accept
my
minority
status
i
would
also
certainly
see
islams
domination
as
having
been
acheived
and
maintained
through
the
powerful
coercive
force
all
majorities
wield
over
minorities
within
their
ranks
islamic
readers
i
am
waiting
to
your
honest
answer
i
want
also
a
honest
answer
from
zionists
for
the
following
questions
i
am
not
a
zionist
but
do
feel
that
both
jewish
and
palestinian
nationalist
desires
need
at
this
juncture
to
be
accepted
in
some
way
do
jews
who
dont
even
believe
in
god
as
is
the
case
with
many
of
the
founders
of
secular
zionism
have
a
right
in
palestine
more
than
the
inhabitants
of
palestine
just
because
god
gave
you
the
land
for
the
same
reason
that
some
muslims
believe
it
is
proper
and
righteous
for
islam
to
be
spread
by
force
upon
those
who
do
not
want
that
do
most
of
them
speak
of
the
west
bank
as
theirs
while
most
of
the
inhabitants
are
not
jews
and
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
israel
i
refer
to
the
most
you
also
refer
to
because
they
are
scared
and
feel
very
threatened
as
well
feeling
that
this
area
is
to
some
degree
part
of
their
beliefreligionheritage
identityetc
i
too
strongly
object
to
those
that
justify
israeli
rule
of
those
who
do
not
want
that
the
occupied
territories
are
not
israels
to
control
to
keep
or
to
dominate
