AND
POINTED
WITH

NOISE
THE
MOB

SO
THE
ASSISTANCE
WE
HAD
BEEN
PROMISED
DID
COME
THEY
SENT
US
HELP
ALL
RIGHT
INSTEAD
OF
SENDING
REAL
SOLDIERS
HE
HAD
SENT
HIS
OWN
I
AM
POSITIVE
THAT
MUSLIMZADE
DID
THAT
NO
ONE
HAD
SEEN
US
ENTERING
THE
SCHOOL
NO
ONE
KNEW
THAT
WE
WERE
THERE
IN
ANY
CASE
WE
STAYED
AT
THE
SCHOOL
UNTIL
SEVEN
IN
THE
MORNING
AND
NO
SOLDIERS
OF
ANY
SORT
CAME
TO
OUR
AID
IN
THE
MORNING
WE
WENT
TO
MY
RELATIVES
IN
MICRODISTRICT
AND
THE
SOLDIERS
TOOK
US
TO
THE
SK
CLUB
FROM
THERE
THE
CLUB
WAS
JAMMED
WITH
PEOPLE
AND
THERE
WERE
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
AHEAD
OF
USTHERE
WAS
NO
SPACE
AVAILABLE
ONE
SMALL
BOY
ABOUT
THREE
MONTHS
OLD
DIED
RIGHT
IN
MY
ARMS
THERE
WASNT
A
SINGLE
DOCTOR
NOTHING
THE
BOY
WAS
UNINJURED
THERE
WERE
NO
WOUNDS
OR
BRUISES
ON
HIM
HE
WAS
JUST
VERY
ILL
THEY
GAVE
HIM
MOUTHTOMOUTH
RESUSCITATION
THEY
DID
EVERYTHING
THEY
COULD
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
BUT
WERE
UNABLE
TO
SAVE
HIM
AND
HIS
MOTHER
AND
FATHER
A
YOUNG
ARMENIAN
COUPLE
WERE
RIGHT
THERE
ON
THE
FLOOR
I
SEARCHED
FOR
A
SPOT
FOR
US
IN
THE
SK
WE
HAVE
A
SMALL
CHILD
OF
OUR
OWN
I
WANTED
TO
FIND
A
ROOM
OR
SOMETHING
TO
PUT
MY
FAMILY
IN
I
WENT
UP
TO
THE
THIRD
FLOOR
THERE
WERE
A
LOT
OF
SOLDIERS
UP
THERE
BANDAGED
WITH
CANES
LIMPING
WITH
THEIR
HEADS
BROKEN
OPEN
THEY
WERE
A
TERRIBLE
SIGHT
YOUNG
GUYS
ALL
OF
THEM
THERE
WERE
A
LOT
OF
BANDAGED
ARMENIANS
TOO
EVERYONE
HAD
BEEN
BEATEN
EVERYONE
WAS
CRYING
WAILING
AND
CALLING
FOR
HELP
I
THINK
THAT
THE
CITY
PARTY
COMMITTEE
IGNORED
US
COMPLETELY
TRUE
THERE
WAS
A
SNACK
BAR
A
SAUSAGE
WAS
KOPEKS
OR
KOPEKS
A
PACKAGE
OF
COOKIES
THAT
COST
KOPEKS
WAS
BEING
SOLD
FOR
A
BOTTLED
SOFT
DRINK
COST
A
RUBLE
BUT
THERE
WAS
NO
WAY
TO
GET
THE
THINGS
ANY
CHEAPER
I
MET
MY
OLD
UNCLE
ARAM
MIKHAILOVICH
THERE
HE
SAW
ME
AND
TEARS
WELLED
UP
IN
HIS
EYES
MY
WHOLE
LIFE
HE
HAD
TOLD
ME
THAT
WE
WERE
FRIENDLY
PEOPLES
THAT
WE
WORKED
TOGETHER
HE
ALWAYS
HAD
AZERBAIJANIS
OVER
AT
HIS
HOUSE
AND
NOW
HE
SAW
ME
AND
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
HE
COULD
SAY
HE
JUST
CRIED
