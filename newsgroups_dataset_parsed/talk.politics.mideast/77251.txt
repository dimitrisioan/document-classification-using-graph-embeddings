WRITES
ACTUALLY
THIS
STRIFE
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
GOES
BACK
A
LONG
WAY
BOSINAN
MUSLIMS
IN
COLLABORATION
WITH
THE
NAZIS
DID
TO
SERBIANS
AFTER
THE
FIRST
WORLD
WAR
WHAT
SERBS
ARE
DOING
TO
MUSLIMS
NOW
THIS
IS
NOT
A
FRESH
CASE
OF
I
DONT
THINK
YOURE
CORRECT
HERE
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
NO
REPORTS
OF
THE
BOSNIANS
MUSLIMS
SUPPORTING
THE
NAZIS
IN
THEIR
GENOCIDE
AGAINST
THE
SERBIANS
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THE
CROAT
GOVT
USING
THEIR
SECRET
POLICE
CALLED
THE
USTACHE
I
THINK
WERE
THE
PRIME
AGENTS
OF
THE
NAZIS
IN
YUGOSLAVIA
AGAINST
THE
SERBS
ACTUALLY
JUST
AFTER
THE
FIRST
WORLD
WAR
MANY
MUSLIMS
WERE
KILLED
BY
SERBS
UNDER
SERBIANLED
REGIME
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
WORLD
WARS
MANY
CROATS
WERE
ALSO
KILLED
ESPECIALLY
DURING
THE
DICTATORSHIP
INTRODUCED
ON
JAN
SOME
CROATS
FORMED
A
RESISTANCE
MOVEMENT
USTASHAS
INSURGENTS
AND
WERE
FORCED
INTO
EXILE
TO
FASCIST
ITALY
WHICH
SHELTERED
THEM
IN
EXILE
THEY
PRACTICED
A
TERRORIST
APPROACH
TO
LIBERATING
CROATIA
WHILE
CROATS
IN
CROATIA
FOLLOWED
THE
APPROACH
OF
PEACEFUL
NEGOTIATIONS
UNDER
THE
LEADERSHIP
OF
VLADKO
MACEK
AFTER
THE
AXIS
POWERS
TOOK
CONTROL
IN
THE
SECOND
WORLD
WAR
VLADKO
MACEK
REFUSED
TO
COLLABORATE
SO
USTASHAS
WERE
BROUGHT
IN
TO
RUN
THE
NEWLY
FORMED
PUPPET
STATE
THIS
STATE
INCLUDED
BOTH
CROATIA
AND
BOSNIAHERZEGOVINA
AND
ITS
IDEOLOGY
SAW
MUSLIMS
AS
THE
BEST
CROATS
FLOWERS
OF
CROATIAN
PEOPLE
SOME
MUSLIMS
IN
BOSNIAHERZEGOVINA
THEREFORE
JOINED
USTASHAS
HOWEVER
EVEN
MORE
OTHERS
DID
NOT
THEY
JOINED
TITOS
PARTISANS
THE
USTASHAS
MEMBERSHIP
PEAKED
AT
LESS
THAN
OF
CROAT
AND
MUSLIM
POPULATION
OF
THAT
AREA
AT
THAT
TIME
AFTER
WWII
MUSLIMS
WERE
STILL
CONSIDERED
A
RELIGIOUS
MINORITY
DESCENDED
FROM
CROATS
OR
SERBS
WHO
CONVERTED
TO
ISLAM
CENTURIES
AGO
BUT
IN
IT
WAS
DECIDED
THAT
FORCING
MUSLIMS
TO
DECLARE
THEIR
NATIONALITY
AS
EITHER
SERBS
OR
CROATS
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
POLICY
DOBRICA
COSIC
THE
CURRENT
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
RUMP
YUGOSLAVIA
WAS
STRONGLY
OPPOSED
AND
SOUGHT
TO
PREVENT
THE
CATEGORY
MUSLIM
IN
AN
ETHNIC
SENSE
FROM
APPEARING
ON
THE
NEXT
CENSUS
HE
WAS
CRITICIZED
AND
EXPELLED
FROM
THE
PARTY
SO
SINCE
THAT
TIME
BOSNIAN
MUSLIMS
ARE
CONSIDERED
A
SEPARATE
NATIONALITY
ALTHOUGH
SOME
STILL
DENY
THIS
AND
INSIST
THAT
THEY
CHOOSE
EITHER
SERB
OR
CROAT
NATIONALITY
SINCERELY
