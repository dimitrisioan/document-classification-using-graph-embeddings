RE
LEGALITY
OF

JEWISH
PURCHASE

ADAM
SHOSTACK
WRITES
SAM
ZBIB
WRITES
IM
SURPRISED
THAT
YOU
DONT
CONSIDER
THE
ACQUISITION
OF
LAND
BY
THE
JEWS
FROM
ARABS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ESTABLISHING
AN
EXCLUSIVE
STATE
AS
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
LEADING
TO
WAR
IT
WAS
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
ESTABLISHING
A
STATE
NOT
AN
EXCLUSIVE
STATE
IF
THE
STATE
WAS
TO
BE
EXCLUSIVE
IT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
ARAB
CITIZENS
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHAT
WAS
THE
ETHNIC
COMPOSITION
OF
ISRAEL
RIGHT
AFTER
IT
WAS
FORMED
ISRAELI
CITIZENS
THE
ETHNIC
COMPOSITION
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
YOU
MEAN
BY
FORMED
WHAT
THE
UN
DEEDED
TO
ISRAEL
WHAT
IT
WON
IN
WAR
AND
NO
I
DO
NOT
CONSIDER
THE
PURCHASE
OF
LAND
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
WHEN
SOMEONE
WANTS
TO
BUY
LAND
AND
SOMEONE
ELSE
IS
WILLING
TO
SELL
IT
AT
A
MUTUALLY
AGREEABLE
PRICE
THEN
THAT
IS
COMMERCE
IT
IS
NOT
A
HOSTILE
ACTION
LEADING
TO
WAR
NO
ONE
IN
HIS
RIGHT
MIND
WOULD
SELL
HIS
FREEDOM
AND
DIGNITY
PALESTINIANS
ARE
NO
EXCEPTION
PERHAPS
YOU
HEARD
ABOUT
ANTITRUST
IN
THE
BUSINESS
WORLD
WERE
THERE
ANTITRUST
LAWS
IN
PLACE
IN
MANDATORY
PALESTINE
SINCE
THE
ANSWER
IS
NO
YOURE
ARGUMENT
WHILE
INTERESTINGLY
CONSTRUCTED
IS
IRRELEVANT
I
WILL
HOWEVER
RESPOND
TO
A
FEW
POINTS
YOU
ASSERT
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
TALKING
ABOUT
ANTITRUST
LAWS
THEY
WERE
ESTABLISHING
A
BRIDGEHEAD
FOR
THE
EUROPEAN
JEWS
AND
THOSE
FLEEING
ARAB
LANDS
WHERE
JEWS
WERE
SECOND
CLASS
CITIZENS
PLUS
THEY
PAID
FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
ETC
JEWS
OFTEN
PAID
FAR
MORE
THAN
FAIR
MARKET
VALUE
FOR
THE
LAND
THEY
BOUGHT
THEY
DID
NOT
KNOW
THEY
WERE
VICTIMS
OF
AN
INTERNATIONAL
CONSPIRACY
YOU
KNOW
SAM
WHEN
PEOPLE
START
TALKING
ABOUT
AN
INTERNATIONAL
JEWISH
CONSPIRACY
ITS
REALLY
BEGINS
TO
SOUND
LIKE
ANTISEMITIC
BULL
THE
REASON
THERE
IS
NO
CONSPIRACY
HERE
IS
QUITE
SIMPLE
ZIONISTS
MADE
NO
BONES
ABOUT
WHAT
WAS
GOING
ON
THERE
WERE
CONFERENCES
PUBLICATIONS
ETC
ALL
TALKING
ABOUT
CREATING
A
NATIONAL
HOME
FOR
THE
JEWS
ISRAEL
GAVE
CITIZENSHIP
TO
THE
REMAINING
ARABS
BECAUSE
IT
HAD
TO
MAINTAIN
A
DEMOCRATIC
FACADE
TO
KEEP
THE
WESTERN
AID
FLOWING
ISRAEL
GOT
NO
WESTERN
AID
IN
NOR
IN
OR
STILL
GRANTED
CITIZENSHIP
TO
THOSE
ARABS
WHO
REMAINED
AND
HOW
IS
GRANTING
CITIZENSHIP
A
FACADE
DONT
GET
ME
WRONG
I
BELEIVE
THAT
ISRAEL
IS
DEMOCRATIC
WITHIN
THE
CONSTRAINTS
OF
ONE
DOMINANT
ETHNIC
GROUP
JEWS
BAD
ARABS
PERSONALY
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
ARAB
COMMUNITY
IN
ISREAL
EXCEPT
THAT
THEYRE
THERE
SO
YES
THEYRE
THERE
BUT
AS
A
COMMUNITY
WITH
HISTORY
AND
ROOTS
ITS
DEAD
BECAUSE
YOUVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
IT
ITS
DEAD
THE
FACT
IS
YOU
CLAIMED
ISRAEL
HAD
TO
GIVE
ARABS
RIGHTS
BECAUSE
OF
NONEXISTANT
INTERNATIONAL
AID
THEN
YOU
SEE
THAT
THAT
ARGUMENT
HAS
A
HOLE
YOU
COULD
DRIVE
A
TRUCK
THROUGH
AND
AGAIN
ASSERT
THAT
ISRAEL
IS
ONLY
DEMOCRATIC
WITHIN
THE
UNEXPLAINED
CONSTRAINTS
OF
ONE
ETHNIC
GROUP
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THAT
ARGUMENT
IS
THAT
ARABS
ARE
ALLOWED
TO
VOTE
FOR
WHOEVER
THEY
PLEASE
SO
PLEASE
TELL
ME
SAM
WHAT
CONSTRAINTS
ARE
THERE
ON
ISRAELI
DEMOCRACY
THAT
DONT
EXIST
IN
OTHER
DEMOCRATIC
STATES
IVE
NEVER
HEARD
ANYTHING
ABOUT
THE
KHAZAKISTANI
ARAB
POPULATION
DOES
THAT
MEAN
THAT
THEY
HAVE
NO
HISTORY
OR
ROOTS
WHEN
I
WAS
AT
BEN
GURION
UNIVERSITY
IN
ISRAEL
ONE
OF
MY
NEIGHBORS
WAS
AN
ISRAELI
ARAB
HE
WASNT
REALLY
ALL
THAT
DIFFERENT
FROM
MY
OTHER
NEIGHBORS
DOES
THAT
MAKE
HIM
DEAD
OR
OPPRESSED
I
STAND
CORRECTED
I
MEANT
THAT
THE
JEWISH
CULTURE
WAS
NOT
PREDOMINANT
IN
PALESTINE
IN
RECENT
HISTORY
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
WITH
JERUSALEM
HAVING
A
JEWISH
CHARACTER
IF
IT
WERE
PREDOMINANTLY
JEWISH
SO
THERE
WHAT
TO
MAKE
OF
THE
REST
PALESTINE
HOW
RECENT
IS
RECENT
I
CAN
PROBABLY
BUILD
A
CASE
FOR
A
JEWISH
GAZA
CITY
IT
WOULD
BE
PRETTY
SILLY
BUT
I
COULD
DO
IT
IM
ARGUING
NOT
THAT
JERUSALEM
IS
JEWISH
BUT
THAT
LAND
HAS
NO
ETHNICITY
