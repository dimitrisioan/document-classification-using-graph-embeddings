RE
ISRAELS
EXPANSION
II
I
UNDERSTAND
HOW
ISRAEL
CAPTURED
THE
TERITORY
AND
FEELS
THAT
IT
IS
ITS
RIGHT
TO
ANNEX
IT
I
CANT
FULLY
UNDERSTAND
WHY
IT
HAS
TO
DEAL
WITH
PALESTINIANS
MUCH
THE
SAME
WAY
JEWS
WERE
TREATED
BEFORE
THE
HOLOCAUST
THE
FINAL
SOLUTION
BY
HITLER
WHAT
I
TOTALLY
DONT
GET
IS
WHY
THE
US
HAS
TO
SUBSIDIZE
THE
EXISTANCE
OF
SUCH
A
THOROUGH
ABUSER
OF
HUMAN
RIGHTS
JUST
WONDERING
