re
israels
expansion
ii
i
understand
how
israel
captured
the
teritory
and
feels
that
it
is
its
right
to
annex
it
i
cant
fully
understand
why
it
has
to
deal
with
palestinians
much
the
same
way
jews
were
treated
before
the
holocaust
the
final
solution
by
hitler
what
i
totally
dont
get
is
why
the
us
has
to
subsidize
the
existance
of
such
a
thorough
abuser
of
human
rights
just
wondering
