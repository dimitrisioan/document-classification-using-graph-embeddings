NO
ITS
AN

OF

ARE
NOWHERE
NEAR
AS
BAD
AS
YOU
CHARACTERIZE
THE
UNITED

POLICE
KILL
AS
MANY
BLACKS
AS
ISRAEL
KILLS
PALESTINIANS
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
US
BLACK
POPULATION
WHILE
ADMITTEDLY
LARGER
ISNT
ENGAGED
IN
A
CIVIL
WAR
TO
ATTEMPT
TO
DESTROY
THE
GOVERNMENT
THIS
PROBABLY
SHOULD
NOT
BE
IN
THIS
NEWGROUP
BUT
MR
FRANK
IS
WRONG
TO
USE
WORDS
LIKE
CIVIL
WAR
OR
DESTROY
THE

IN
DISCUSSING
THE
CONFLICT
IN
THE
OCCUPIED

THE

FOLLOWUPS
SET
TO
TALKPOLITICSMIDEAST
WHERE
THIS
BELONGS
THIS
MAY
MAKE
THE
TERM
CIVIL
WAR
DUBIOUS
BUT
IT
DOES
NOTHING
TO
THE
PHRASE
DESTROY
THE
GOVERNMENT
AN
OCCUPYING
GOVERNMENT
IS
STILL
A
GOVERN
MENT
AND
THE
PALESTINIANS
HAVE
MADE
IT
QUITE
CLEAR
THAT
THEIR
GOAL
IS
NOT
SIMPLY
TO
PREVENT
IT
FROM
OCCUPYING
THE
TERRITORIES
THAT
DONT
CON
FER
CITIZENSHIP
WHICH
IS
YOUR
OWN
DETERMINATION
OF
THE
DISTINCTION
BUT
TO
WIPE
IT
OUT
ENTIRELY
AND
NOT
INCIDENTALLY
THE
ENTIRE
JEWISH
POPULATION
IT
RULES
WITH
IT
THIS
IS
AN
INTENT
TO
DESTROY
THE
GOVERNMENT
NO
MATTER
WHERE
THE
GOVERNMENT
HAPPENS
TO
BE
FROM
IF
THE
CURRENT
GOVERNMENT
IN
ISREAL
WOULD
BE
WILLING
TO
LET
ALL
ADULT
INDIVIDUALS
WHO
ARE
CAPABLE
TO
VOTE
IN
ELECTIONS
WITHIN
THE
DEFACTO
BOUNDARIES
OF
THE
ISREALI
STATE
A
REQUIREMENT
FOR
BEING
CALLED
A
DEMOCRACY
IN
MY
OPINION
WASNT
A
REQUIREMENT
FOR
DEMOCRACY
IN
ATHENS
FOR
THAT
MATTER
ISNT
A
REQUIREMENT
FOR
THE
TERM
DEMOCRACY
IN
THE
UNITED
STATES
WHICH
DOESNT
LET
NONCITIZENS
VOTE
EITHER
BOTH
THE
UNITED
STATES
AND
ISRAEL
HAVE
PROCESSES
WHEREBY
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
TO
ACQUIRE
CITIZENSHIP
WITH
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
EFFORT
AND
A
MODICUM
OF
SCREENING
ITS
JUST
THAT
IT
ISNT
AUTOMATIC
FOR
LIVING
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
IT
ISNT
AUTOMATIC
FOR
LIVING
IN
NEW

EITHER
THAT
SAID
SUIT
YOURSELF
HAVING
NEVER
CONSIDERED
DEMOCRACY
THE
ULTIMATE
IN
GOOD
IN
THIS
WORLD
I
COULD
CARE
LESS
IF
YOU
FEEL
LIKE
CALLING
ISRAEL
OR
AMERICA
OR
ANYWHERE
ELSE
A
DEMOCRACY
PERSONALLY
I
WITHHOLD
THE
TERM
FROM
ISRAEL
FOR
THE
SAME
REASON
I
WITHHOLD
IT
FROM
BRITAIN
THE
PARLIAMENTARY
SYSTEM
IS
A
SERIOUS
HANDICAP
THEN
MR
FRANK
WOULD
BE
CORRECT
AS
THE
CURRENT
GOVERNMENT
NEITHER
IS
WILLING
TO
ENFRACHISE
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
INDIVIDUALS
IN
THE
TERRITORIES
OR
TO
ALLOW
THESE
PEOPLE
TO
HAVE
THE
RIGHT
TO
SELF
DETERMINATION
IT
IS
NOT
A
CIVIL
WAR
OR
THEIR
GOVERNMENT
RATHER
IT
IS
RESITANCE
TO
A
FOREIGN
OCCUPIER
AGAIN
SUIT
YOURSELF
IN
WHICH
CASE
ISRAEL
IS
NOT
ATTACKING
ITS
OWN
PEOPLE
IT
IS
FIGHTING
A
WAR
ON
FOREIGN
SOIL
IN
WHICH
CASE
THE
RESIDENTS
ARE
ENTITLED
TO
PLAY
ROUGH
YES
BUT
ISRAELS
ALLOWED
TO
GET
JUST
AS
ROUGH
WITHIN
THE
BARE
LIMITS
OF
THE
RULES
OF
WAR
THIS
INCLUDES
AMONG
OTHER
THINGS
THE
RIGHT
TO
SHOOT
OR
BOMB
ANYONE
A
NATIONAL
OF
THE
COUN
TRY
IN
QUESTION
WHO
IS
FIGHTING
THEM
WHICH
PERMITS
MASS
FRONTAL
ASSAULT
ON
ALL
ROCKTHROWERS
ALONG
WITH
THE
RIGHT
TO
TAKE
OUT
ANY
INSTALLATION
OF
MILITARY
IMPORTANCE
CERTAIN
VILLAGES
WITH
TOOGOOD
FORTIFICATIONS
CAN
BE
HANDLED
BY
AERIAL
BOMBING
AS
CAN
WATERWAYS
SINCE
THEY
COUNT
AS
SUPPLY
LINES
TO
THE
ENEMY
AND
THE
RIGHT
TO
DO
ANYTHING
WHATSOEVER
TO
WHATEVER
CONSTITUTES
A

THAT
THEY
CAN
LAY

IF
HAMAS
IS
