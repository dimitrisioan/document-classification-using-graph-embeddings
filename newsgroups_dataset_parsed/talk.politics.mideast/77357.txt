RE
MOSQUE
IN
JEWISH
QUARTER
WAS
RE
ISRAELI
DESTRUCTION
OF
I
ALWAYS
BELIEVED
THE
STATEMENT
THOSE
WHO
DO
NOT
KNOW
THEIR
HISTORY
ARE
CONDEMNED
TO
REPEAT
IT
WILL
DURANT
BUT
I
AM
BEGINNING
TO
BELIEVE
THE
OPPOSITE
IS
TRUE
HERE
IN
TPM
AND
IN
OTHER
NEWSGROUPS
IT
SEEMS
THAT
HISTORY
IS
MAINLY
REMEMBERED
TO
FOMENT
HATRED
OR
TO
BE
USED
AS
A
CLUB
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
MY
OWN
PEOPLE
THERE
ARE
AMPLE
ACTS
OF
SHAME
BOTH
DONE
BY
MY
PEOPLE
AND
DONE
TO
MY
PEOPLE
SINCE
I
WAS
NOT
PARTY
TO
ANY
OF
THOSE
ACTS
I
REFUSE
TO
ACCEPT
BLAME
FOR
THE
EVIL
ACTS
THAT
MY
ANCESTORS
COMMITTED
NOR
DO
I
DIRECT
HATRED
TOWARD
THE
DESCENDANTS
OF
THOSE
WHO
COMMITTED
EVIL
ACTS
AGAINST
MY
ANCESTORS
WILL
ALL
OF
THIS
DISCUSSION
REBUILD
A
SINGLE
MOSQUE
WILL
IT
REBUILD
THE
TEMPLE
SOMEHOW
I
DOUBT
THAT
IT
WILL
A
POST
IN
ANOTHER
GROUP
ON
THE
BOSNIAN
WAR
ASKED
US
ALL
TO
LOVE
EACH
OTHER
THAT
LOVE
WOULD
CONQUER
HATE
SADLY
I
REMEMBER
A
TV
INTERVIEW
WITH
A
YOUNG
WOMAN
IN
SARAJEVO
SP
WHO
WAS
AS
I
REMEMBER
A
FORMER
OLYMPIC
CALIBRE
CONTESTANT
IN
THE
RIFLE
SHOOT
SHE
WAS
NOW
TRYING
TO
PICKOFF
SERBIAN
SNIPERS
DURING
THE
COMMUNIST
YEARS
SHE
HAD
MARRIED
A
SERB
WHO
WAS
NOW
FIGHTING
AGAINST
HER
PEOPLE
SO
IT
SEEMS
THAT
HATE
WILL
CONQUER
LOVE
IS
THERE
AN
ODD
CHANCE
THAT
WE
MIGHT
ALL
FORGET
PAST
WRONGS
AND
TRY
AND
SEE
HOW
WE
MIGHT
ALL
LIVE
TOGETHER
ITS
A
DAMN
SMALL
PLANET
WHICH
WE
HAVE
COME
VERY
CLOSE
TO
TURNING
INTO
A
RADIOACTIVE
BALL
GLOWING
SOFTLY
IN
SPACE
WE
SEEM
TO
HAVE
BEEN
SPARED
THAT
PROSPECT
SHALL
WE
NOW
BATHE
IT
IN
EACH
OTHERS
BLOOD
SHALOM
SALAM
AND
PEACE
REB
