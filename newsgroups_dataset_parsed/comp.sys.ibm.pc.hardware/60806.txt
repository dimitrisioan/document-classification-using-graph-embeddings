there

eg
disk
controller
and

there
are
also
devices
that
does
not
require
exclusive
ownership
ie
it
will
share
an
interrupt
with
another
device
eg
no
in
a
standard
isa
bus
the
one
that
almost
all
nonlaptop
pcs
use
two
separate
interface
cards
cannot
share
an
interrupt
this
is
due
to
a
screwup
in
the
bus
design
for
example
if
your
soundblaster
wants
to
drive
interrupt
number
then
it
must
hold
a
certain
bus
wire
to
or
at
all
times
depending
on
whether
or
not
it
wants
an
interrupt
this
precludes
letting
another
card
assert
interrupt
number
when
two
or
more
devices
in
an
isa
bus
pc
share
an
interrupt
its
because
theyre
implemented
by
a
single
card
interesting
would
you
care
to
explain
to
me
then
how
my
soundblaster
pro
card
and
my
printer
card
are
sharing
irq
successfully
i
assure
you
that
they
are
both
set
to
irq
and
that
i
have
no
problem
my
computer
is
a
dtk
ibm
clone
