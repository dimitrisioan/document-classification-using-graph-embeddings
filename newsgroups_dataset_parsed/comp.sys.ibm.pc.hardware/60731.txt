is
deciding
a
hddfdd

is
vlbus
hddfdd

faster

bit
ide
hddfdd
controller
card
no
vlbus
ide
is
no
faster
than
isa
ide
the
ide
interface
is
fundamentally
nothing
more
than
an
extension
of
the
isa
bus
and
if
you
hook
it
to
vlbus
itll
work
as
fast
as
the
slower
of
the
two
meaning
isa
speed
i
hear
that
the
vl
bus
controller
is
slower
than
a
ide
controller
on
the
other
hand
i
wouldnt
expect
it
to
be
slower
