quantum
hard
disk
phantom
seeks
i
just
purchased
and
installed
a
quantum
hard
drive
model
and
have
a
concern
about
its
behavior
although
the
disk
drive
itself
seems
to
behave
properly
with
respect
to
file
io
it
performs
what
i
call
phantom
seeks
when
the
pc
is
absolutely
idle
i
can
hear
a
spurt
of
activity
in
the
drive
every
seconds
lasting
seconds
this
activity
seems
to
be
initiated
strictly
within
the
drive
itself
since
the
disk
led
never
comes
on
the
disk
led
is
attached
to
the
disk
controller
card
not
the
drive
my
other
hard
disk
a
seagate
does
not
have
this
kind
behavior
can
anyone
comment
on
this
strange
phenomenon
