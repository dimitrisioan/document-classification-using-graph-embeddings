HELP
BLOWING
THE
STACK
HI
EVERYONE
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
REGARDING
MY
STACK
ON
MY
PC
I
AM
PROGRAMMING
IN
TURBO
C
AND
MY
PROGRAM
IS
RATHER
LARGE
MODEL
LARGE
TOO
I
KEEP
GETTING
ERRORS
THAT
I
AM
RUNNING
OUT
OF
MEMORY
AFTER
A
WHILE
OF
RUNNING
THE
PROGRAM
WHEN
I
COMPILE
THE
PROGRAM
IT
SAYS
I
HAVE
MEG
OF
RAM
SO
I
CANT
SEEM
TO
EXPLAIN
WHY
IT
CRASHES
ALL
IT
IS
DOING
IS
RUNNING
IN
A
LOOP
WHILE
THE
OPERATOR
IS
IDLE
AND
AFTER
A
WHILE
OF
SITTING
IT
WILL
SCREW
UP
ALL
THE
VARIABLES
THIS
LEADS
ME
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
MY
STACK
IS
FILLING
UP
AND
OVERFLOWING
DOES
THE
PROGRAM
TAKE
MEMORY
UP
WHEN
IT
IS
CALLING
VOID
FUNCTIONS
THAT
DO
NOT
RETURN
ANYTHING
I
HAVE
BEEN
WORKING
ON
THIS
PROBLEM
FOR
DAYS
AND
I
WOULD
REALLY
APPRECIATE
ANY
RESPONCE
IF
THIS
IS
NOT
THE
CORRECT
NEWSGROUP
I
WILL
GLADLY
REPOST
BUT
THIS
IS
THE
ONLY
I
COULD
FIND
THANKS

ADVANCE
