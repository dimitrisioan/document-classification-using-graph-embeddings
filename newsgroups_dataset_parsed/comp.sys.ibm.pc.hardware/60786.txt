MICRO
SOLUTIONS
BACKPACK
NOT
WORKING
PROPERLY
HELLO
ALL
I
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
MY
MICRO
SOLUTIONS
BACKPACK
SOMETIMES
IT
WORKS
SOMETIMES
IT
DOESNT
I
WILL
EITHER
START
A
BACKUP
OR
START
A
TAPE
FORMAT
AND
AT
ABOUT
PERCENT
I
GET
AN
ERROR
EITHER
SAYING
THE
TAPE
IS
BAD
OR
THE
BACKUPFORMAT
HAS
ABORTED
FOR
AN
UNKNOWN
REASON
IF
I
TURN
EVERYTHING
OFF
AND
WAIT
A
HALF
HOUR
IT
WORKS
FINE
IS
IT
BECAUSE
THE
TAPE
BACKUP
IS
TOO
WARM
HAS
ANYONE
HAD
SIMILAR
EXPERIENCES
THANKS
KEVIN
