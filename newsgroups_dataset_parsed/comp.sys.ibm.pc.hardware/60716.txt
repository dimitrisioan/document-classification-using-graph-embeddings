SEVERAL
PROBLEMS
THE
AD
SPECIFIED
MILLION
COLORS
AT
RESOLUTION
WITH
OF
VRAM
WHICH
IS
WHAT
I
HAVE
THIS
COLOR
DEPTH
IS
NOT
SUPPORTED
WITH
VIDEO
BIOS
VERSION
AND
DRIVERS
VERSION
A
MAX
OF
COLORS
ARE
SUPPORTED
AT
AND
RESOLUTIONS
WITH
VRAM
WITH
THE
COLOR
CHOICE
I
NOTICE
TWO
MINOR
IRRITATIONS
A
UNDER
NDW
WHEN
AN
ENTRY
IN
A
LIST
IS
HIGHLIGHTED
SUCH
AS
IN
AN
OPEN
MENU
AND
THEN
IS
DESELECTED
A
FAINT
VERTICAL
LINE
OFTEN
REMAINS
WHERE
THE
LEFT
EDGE
OF
THE
HIGHLIGHTED
RECTANGLE
USED
TO
BE
B
WITH
WORD
FOR
WINDOWS
WHEN
YOU
USE
SHADING
IN
A
TABLE
THE
DISPLAY
SHOWS
THE
INVERSE
OF
THE
SHADING
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
YOU
SHADE
THE
CELL
AS
THE
DISPLAY
IS
THE
PRINTOUT
IS
OK
THE
BIG
KILLER
BUG
IS
USING
THE
BORLAND
C
INTEGRATED
DEVELOPMENT
ENVIRONMENT
THE
PROBLEM
OCCURS
WHEN
YOU
CLICK
ON
THE
TURBO
DEBUGGER
ICON
OR
USE
THE
DEBUGGER
OPTION
IN
THE
RUN
COMMAND
AND
THE
DEBUGGER
APPLICATION
GOES
TO
VGA
CHARACTER
MODE
AS
IT
IS
DESIGNED
TO
DO
THE
SCREEN
GOES
HAYWIRE
AND
IS
LARGELY
UNREADABLE
THE
TURBO
DEBUGGER
DISPLAY
IS
ALL
GARBLED
THROUGH
TRIAL
AND
ERROR
I
HAVE
FOUND
THAT
WHEN
THE
DISRUPTED
SCREEN
IS
DISPLAYED
YOU
SHOULD
DO
ALTSPACEBAR
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
LETTER
R
THIS
INSTRUCTS
TURBO
DEBUGGER
TO
REFRESH
THE
SCREEN
AND
IT
DOES
THIS
SATISFACTORILY
I
WISH
I
DIDNT
HAVE
TO
DO
THIS
THE
BUG
IS
MORE
THAN
WITH
THE
DIAMOND
DRIVERS
THE
SAME
DISRUPTIVE
BEHAVIOR
HAPPENS
WITH
THE
STANDARD
VGA
DRIVER
THAT
COMES
WITH
WINDOWS
THERE
MUST
BE
SOMETHING
IN
THE
VIDEO
CARD
THAT
MISHANDLES
THE
VGA
MODE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
MY
MONITOR
THE
SAME
BUG
SHOWS
UP
WHEN
I
USE
ANOTHER
MONITOR
IN
PLACE
OF
MY
USUAL
ONE
I
STILL
LIKE
THIS
VIDEO
CARD
AND
AM
HOPING
ITS
PROBLEMS
WILL
BE
REMEDIED
THEY
DO
OFFER
A
YEAR
WARRANTY
