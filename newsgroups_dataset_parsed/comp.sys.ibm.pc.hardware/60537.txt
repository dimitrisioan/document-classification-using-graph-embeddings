you
have
probably
solved
your
problem
by
now
anyway
if
you
can
get
your
hands
on
qa
plus
version
maybe
others
as
well
it
will
let
you
write
the
compaq
cmos
settings
i
know
because
i
just
did
it
i
was
just
about
to
search
for
such
a
diagnostic
disk
when
my
brotherinlaw
fixed
an
old
deskpro

it

might
try
