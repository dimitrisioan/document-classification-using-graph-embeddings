I
AM
LOOKING
AT
PURCHASING
A
SYSTEM
FROM
ZEOS
COMPUTERS
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
IF
PEOPLE
COULD
GIVE
ME
SOME
FEEDBACK
ABOUT
THE
QUALITY
OF
THEIR
PRODUCTS
AND
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
ALONG
WITH
ANY
ADVICE
ABOUT
WHICH
SYSTEMS
PEOPLE
LIKE
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
I
BOUGHT
A
SYSTEM
A
LITTLE
OVER
YEARS
AGO
AND
WAS
SATISFIED
WITH
EVERYTHING
ABOUT
ZEOS
THAT
COMPUTER
WENT
OFF
TO
GRAD
SCHOOL
WITH
MY
SON
AND
I
REPLACED
IT
WITH
A
PKG
MBHD
RAM
WITH
DIAMOND
VIPER
LEVEL
CACHE
AND
TOWER
UPGRADES
DELETE
THE
CTX
MONITOR
I
GOT
A
HP
MONITOR
EMPLOYEE
PURCHASE
THIS
IS
A
GREAT
SYSTEM
FAST
QUIET
SOLIDLY
BUILT
NOT
A
SINGLE
GLITCH
BRINGING
IT
UP
TECH
SUPPORT
SEEMS
BUSIER
NOW
THAN
YEARS
AGO
I
CALLED
WITH
A
CONFIGURATION
QUESTION
AND
THEY
CALLED
BACK
HOURS
LATER
WITH
THE
RIGHT
ANSWER
I
THINK
THERES
A
SLIGHT
PREMIUM
OVER
GATEWAY
PRICES
BUT
IMHO
ZEOS
IS
WORTH
IT
BTW
THEY
HAVE
ENOUGH
LINES
THAT
IVE
NEVER
GOTTEN
A
BUSY
SIGNAL
CALLING
SALES
CUSTOMER
SERVICE
OR
TECH
SUPPORT
NOW
YOU
USUALLY
WAIT
OR
MINUTES
TO
TALK
TO
SOMEONE
BUT
AT
LEAST
YOU
GET
IN
THE
QUEUE
AND
WAIT
ON
THEIR
DIME
