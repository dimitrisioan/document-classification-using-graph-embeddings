ibm
vs
teac
fd
hello
i
already
tried
our
national
news
group
without
success
i
tried
to
replace
a
friends
original
ibm
floppy
disk
in
his
with
a
normal
teac
drive
i
already
identified
the
power
supply
on
pins
and
shorted
pin
switch
and
inserted
pullup
resistors
on
pins
and
the
computer
doesnt
complain
about
a
missing
fd
but
the
fds
light
stays
on
all
the
time
the
drive
spins
up
ok
when
i
insert
a
disk
but
i
cant
access
it
the
teac
works
fine
in
a
normal
pc
are
there
any
points
i
missed
thank
you
