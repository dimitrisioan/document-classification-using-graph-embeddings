IBM
VS
TEAC
FD
HELLO
I
ALREADY
TRIED
OUR
NATIONAL
NEWS
GROUP
WITHOUT
SUCCESS
I
TRIED
TO
REPLACE
A
FRIENDS
ORIGINAL
IBM
FLOPPY
DISK
IN
HIS
WITH
A
NORMAL
TEAC
DRIVE
I
ALREADY
IDENTIFIED
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
ON
PINS
AND
SHORTED
PIN
SWITCH
AND
INSERTED
PULLUP
RESISTORS
ON
PINS
AND
THE
COMPUTER
DOESNT
COMPLAIN
ABOUT
A
MISSING
FD
BUT
THE
FDS
LIGHT
STAYS
ON
ALL
THE
TIME
THE
DRIVE
SPINS
UP
OK
WHEN
I
INSERT
A
DISK
BUT
I
CANT
ACCESS
IT
THE
TEAC
WORKS
FINE
IN
A
NORMAL
PC
ARE
THERE
ANY
POINTS
I
MISSED
THANK
YOU
