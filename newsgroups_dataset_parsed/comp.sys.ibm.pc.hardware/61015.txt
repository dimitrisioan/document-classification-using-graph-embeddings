looking
for
help
in
just
the
right
place
does
anyone
have
experience
with
the
promise
technology
caching
ide
controller
i
just
ordered
one
with
installed
and
have
a
few
questions
is
it
easy
to
use
does
it
need
any
kind
of
tsrs
or
is
it
completely
transparent
to
the
system
board
so
that
i
wont
have
to
change
the
bios
configuration
yes
its
easy
to
use
its
just
like
an
ordinary
controller
you
dont
have
to
change
the
bios
config
is
it
transparent
to
the
ide
drive
will
it
work
with
any
drive
or
does
it
have
to
be
configured
explicity
for
the
type
of
drive
installed
its
transparent
it
works
with
any
drive
if
you
change
the
drive
you
only
need
to
change
the
bios
config
as
usual
will
it
work
with
a
dualdrive
system
master
and
slave
yes
no
problem
with
it
will
i
need
smartdrive
or
dos
buffers
that
depends
you
will
get
a
little
better
performance
if
you
use
smartdrive
and
buffers
in
addition
thats
because
access
to
the
card
through
the
isa
bus
is
slower
than
access
to
system
ram
i
dont
use
smartdrive
myself
but
i
have
a
few
buffers
is
the
promise
technology
controller
a
good
one
any
information
would
be
greatly
appreciated
thanks

anything
stated
here
is
my
opinion
only
y
d
rule
of
the
great
when
people
you
greatly
admire
appear
to
be
thinking
deep
thoughts
they
probably
are
thinking
about
lunch
