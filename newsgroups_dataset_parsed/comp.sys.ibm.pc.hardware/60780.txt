HALTED
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
IDEAS
YOU
UNFORTUNATELY
FAILED
TO
MENTION
IF
THE
ERROR
OCCURS
WITH
THE
PARITY

CHECKING
ENABLED

DISABLED
I
ASSUME
YOU
MEAN
IT
GIVES
YOU
A
PARITY
ERROR
WHEN
ITS
ENABLED
AND
NOT
WHEN
ITS

HOW
HIGH
WILL
THE

GO
ON
THE

CHECK
AT

THIS

OCCURS
DOES
THE

BEEP
AT

WHATS
THE

THE

COULD
BE
OCCURING
IN

NOT
SO
LIKELY

THE

YOUR
