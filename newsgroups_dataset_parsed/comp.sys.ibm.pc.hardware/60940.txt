just
got
a
system
and
am
considering
getting
a
fan
for
the
cpu
the
processor
when
running
is
too
hot
to
touch
so
i
think
this
is
a
fairly
good
idea
long
ago
when
i
did
some
electronics
training
i
read
somewhere
that
the
regions
within
a
chip
that
define
junctionsgates
etc
slowly
diffuse
over
time
and
this
increases
with
temperature
hence
a
hot
chip
goes
offspec
sooner
has
anyone
out
there
got
a
cpu
fan
is
there
more
than
type
do
you
have
to
remove
the
cpu
from
its
scoket
to
install
the
fan
do
all
cpu
fans
derive
their
power
from
spare
drive
power
lines
anyone
had
any
trouble
with
cpu
fans
does
anyone
have
any
evidence
that
cpu
fans
are
a
complete
waste
of
money
how
are
these
fans
attached
glue
clips
melted
cheese
roughly
how
much
cooler
will
the
cpu
be
with
a
fan
as
opposed
to
without
an
advert
ive
read
claims
vs
any
info
appreciated

dr
who
i
own
a
pc
fancard
ii
which
is
a
slightly
different
beast
its
a
long
card
that
plugs
into
an
or
bit
slot
and
contains
two
muffin
fans
it
requires
no
extra
cabling
i
had
a
that
was
experiencing
some
problems
due
to
heat
the
fancard
made
the
system
run
cool
enough
so
that
the
problem
no
longer
appears
its
supposed
to
keep
the
internal
temperature
in
the
range
of
degrees
fahrenheit
according
to
the
makers
ms
tech
advertisements
the
us
army
used
a
bunch
of
these
to
keep
their
pcs
running
wo
ac
in
desert
storm
i
cant
vouch
for
that
however
i
am
a
satisfied
customer
and
i
have
no
other
connection
with
the
maker
or
the
mailorder
house
lyben
hope
this
helps
