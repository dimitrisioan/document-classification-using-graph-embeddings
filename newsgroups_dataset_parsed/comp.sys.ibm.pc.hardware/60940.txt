JUST
GOT
A
SYSTEM
AND
AM
CONSIDERING
GETTING
A
FAN
FOR
THE
CPU
THE
PROCESSOR
WHEN
RUNNING
IS
TOO
HOT
TO
TOUCH
SO
I
THINK
THIS
IS
A
FAIRLY
GOOD
IDEA
LONG
AGO
WHEN
I
DID
SOME
ELECTRONICS
TRAINING
I
READ
SOMEWHERE
THAT
THE
REGIONS
WITHIN
A
CHIP
THAT
DEFINE
JUNCTIONSGATES
ETC
SLOWLY
DIFFUSE
OVER
TIME
AND
THIS
INCREASES
WITH
TEMPERATURE
HENCE
A
HOT
CHIP
GOES
OFFSPEC
SOONER
HAS
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
GOT
A
CPU
FAN
IS
THERE
MORE
THAN
TYPE
DO
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
CPU
FROM
ITS
SCOKET
TO
INSTALL
THE
FAN
DO
ALL
CPU
FANS
DERIVE
THEIR
POWER
FROM
SPARE
DRIVE
POWER
LINES
ANYONE
HAD
ANY
TROUBLE
WITH
CPU
FANS
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
EVIDENCE
THAT
CPU
FANS
ARE
A
COMPLETE
WASTE
OF
MONEY
HOW
ARE
THESE
FANS
ATTACHED
GLUE
CLIPS
MELTED
CHEESE
ROUGHLY
HOW
MUCH
COOLER
WILL
THE
CPU
BE
WITH
A
FAN

OPPOSED

A

CONTAINS

IT

I
HAD
A
THAT
WAS
EXPERIENCING
SOME
PROBLEMS
DUE
TO

THE

MADE
THE

RUN
COOL

SO
THAT
THE

NO
