WROTE
JUST
GOT
A
SYSTEM
AND
AM
CONSIDERING
GETTING
A
FAN
FOR
THE
CPU
THE
PROCESSOR
WHEN
RUNNING
IS
TOO
HOT
TO
TOUCH
SO
I
THINK
THIS
IS
A
STUFF
DELETED
MY
IS
ABOUT
A
WEEK
OLD
AND
IS
CUSTOM
BUILT
BY
ME
AND
FOR
ME
I
AM
USING
THE
PC
POWER
AND
COOLING
CPU
COOLER
THIS
ONE
HAS
PRECISION
BALL
BEARINGS
IN
THE
MOTOR
IT
HAS
A
PRETTY
SUBSTANTIAL
HEAT
SINK
SO
IF
IT
HAPPENED
TO
FAIL
IT
WOULD
STILL
PROBABLY
DISSIPATE
MORE
HEAT
THAN
THE
BARE
CHIP
IT
ATTACHES
WITH
PEEL
OFF
ADHESIVE
THIS
IS
A
FULL
SIZE
AT
CASE
SO
THE
FAN
HAS
GRAVITY
IN
ITS
FAVOR
I
WOULD
BE
A
LITTLE
NERVOUS
ABOUT
FINDING
THE
FAN
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
A
TOWER
CASE
IF
IT
HAPPENED
TO
LET
GO
ALL
OF
THE
CPU
FANS
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
ARE
POWERED
FROM
A
DRIVE
CABLE
THERE
ARE
OTHER
BOARD
TYPE
FANS
WHICH
ARE
ISA
BOARDS
WITH
A
COUPLE
OF
FANS
MOUNTED
ON
THEM
THEY
ARE
POWERED
BY
THE
SLOT
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
EFFECTIVE
THEY
ARE
MAYBE
SOMEONE
ELSE
COULD
COMMENT
THE
CPU
IS
COOL
ENOUGH
TO
TOUCH
WITH
THE
PCPC
UNIT
PCCONNECTION
AT
HAS
THEM
FOR
NEXT
DAY
DELIVERY
THE
Y
CORD
IS
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
A
SPARE
LEAD
OFF
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
PCPC
MAKE
THE
BEST
POWER
SUPPLIES
AVAILABLE
