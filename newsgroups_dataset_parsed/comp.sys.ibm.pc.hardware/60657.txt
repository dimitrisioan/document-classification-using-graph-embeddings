whats
the
difference
between
loading
mousecom
in
autoexecbat
and
doing
devicemousesys
in
configsys
the
only
difference
is
the
time
the
driver
gets
loaded
mousesys
will
be
loaded
during
the
configsys
and
therefor
before
the
commandcom
mousecom
will
be
loaded
during
autoexecbat
and
so
after
the
commandcom
which
one
is
better
mousecom
could
be
started
from
the
commandline
after
the
booting
and
it
could
perhaps
be
unloaded
if
no
other
driver
is
loaded
after
it
the
working
of
both
drivers
is
totally
the
same
when
i
ran
dos
i
preferred
loading
most
of
the
drivers
in
autoexecbat
because
some
programs
wont
run
with
some
drivers
and
i
could
choose
the
ones
i
needed
during
startup
but
with
this
advantage
is
gone
because
drdos
lets
you
choose
in
configsys
which
drivers
should
be
loaded
