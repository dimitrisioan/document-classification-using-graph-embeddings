new
gig
rpm
drives
ratings
ive
noticed
a
recent
proliferation
of
gig
drives
in
particular
the
fujitsu
and
the
micropolis
there
is
also
the
maxtor
rpm
gig
drive
they
are
all
quite
cheap
and
have
nice
year
warranties
my
questions
are
is
there
a
catch
which
one
is
better
what
type
of
do
these
drives
use
is
the
service
generally
better
for
one
of
these
manufacturers
are
prices
likely
to
go
down
soon
for
any
reason
thanks
