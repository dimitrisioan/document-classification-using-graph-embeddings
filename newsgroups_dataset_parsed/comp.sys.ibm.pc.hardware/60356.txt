hello
my
question
is
could
someone
email
me
the
names
of
manufactures
of
the
and
predecsor
uarts
i
have
only
seen
them
refered
to
by
number
however
i
would
like
to
find
a
technical
manual
for
these
ics
any
where
i
can
find
out
the
technical
specs
for
these
uarts
would
be
appreciated
prefereably
the
as
well
as
the
however
one
will
do
i
suggest
that
you
go
direct
to
the
original
and
preferredbest
quality
source
for
all
of
this
just
as
you
would
at
least
should
for
the
chips
themselves
national
semiconductor
you
can
reach
them
at
they
no
longer
package
the
data
sheets
in
a
book
as
they
did
when
i
got
mine
but
you
can
get
them
as
individual
sets
of
data
sheets
you
want
as
a
minimum
the
following
sets
of
data
sheets
application
notes
yes
get
these
the
uart
design
and
application
considerations
a
comparison
of
the
and
series
of
uarts
both
of
the
application
notes
i
listed
have
proven
to
be
at
least
as
valuable
as
the
data
sheets
themselves
more
actually
in
particular
is
an
exceptionally
wellwritten
application
note
that
goes
into
detail
about
how
and
why
the
does
what
it
does
and
how
best
to
take
advantage
of
it
btw
they
send
these
out
free
as
long
as
you
dont
abuse
it
later
