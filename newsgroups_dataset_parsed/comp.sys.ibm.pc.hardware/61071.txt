using
xt
pwr
spply
i
am
planning
on
upgrading
my
old
xt
compatible
system
with
a
new
motherboard
hard
drive
and
mb
floppy
i
am
interested
in
using
my
old
power
supply
w
to
power
the
new
hardware
if
possible
i
have
been
told
by
the
motherboard
vendor
that
i
could
probably
use
the
supply
if
it
had
twelve
wires
going
to
the
motherboard
apparently
some
xt
vintage
supplies
had
only
wires
the
wire
is
a
line
used
to
charge
the
motherboard
battery
my
question
is
has
anybody
tried
bringing
an
additional
wire
out
of
an
wire
supply
or
using
an
auxiliary
power
source
to
charge
the
motherboard
battery
i
do
not
wish
to
buy
an
entirely
new
power
supply
if
i
can
make
use
of
my
existing
one
with
simple
hacks
thank
you
for
any
information
an
email
reply
to
rarbanasrcsunagmrcom
would
be
fine
