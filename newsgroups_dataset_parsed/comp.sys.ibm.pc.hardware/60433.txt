ADCOCK
WRITES
IVE
BEEN
INTENTLY
FOLLOWING
THE
MAG
THREAD
WHILE
WAITING
FOR
MINE
TO
ARRIVE
IN
THE
MAIL
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
LOT
OF
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
MINOR
ALIGNMENT
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
ONE
ARTICLE
CONTAINED
A
COMMENT
THAT
THE
OWNER
CALLED
THE
FACTORY
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
HIS
SCREEN
ROTATION
WAS
WITHIN
SPEC
THAT
FIGURE
FOR
IMAGE
ROTATION
WOULD
SEEM
TO
BE
A
LITTLE
HIGH
ON
MY
NEC
THE
SPECS
CALL
FOR
NO
GREATER
THAN
WELL
MY
MONITOR
ARRIVED
LAST
NIGHT
AND
SURE
ENOUGH
IT
HAS
A
VERY
NOTICABLE
BARREL
DISTORTION
ITS
NOT
DRAMATIC
BUT
IT
IS
THERE
AND
IT
IS
ESPECIALLY
NOTICABLE
WHEN
THE
IMAGE
DOESNT
FILL
THE
ENTIRE
SCREEN
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
IS
WORSE
ON
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
DOESNT
HELP
MATTERS
WHAT
IM
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
IS
IF
THESE
MINOR
IMPERFECTIONS
ARE
THE
NORM
OR
ARE
MOST
OF
THEIR
MONITORS
PERFECT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
SEND
IT
BACK
AND
GET
ONE
WITH
THE
SAME
OR
AN
EVEN
WORSE
PROBLEM
DOES
THE
FACTORY
CONSIDER
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
NORMAL
AND
SHIP
THEIR
MONITORS
WITH
LESS
THAN
PERFECT
ALIGNMENT
I
CANT
SPEAK
FOR
MAG
INNOVISION
BUT
AS
FAR
AS
NEC
IS
CONCERNED
THEY
ARE
ADJUSTED
TO
FACTORYSPEC
BEFORE
LEAVING
THE
CENTRAL
USA
DISTRIBUTION
POINT
MA
FOR
THE
EASTERN
CANADIAN
MARKET
NOW
HERES
THE
KEY
NEC
KNOWS
THAT
THE
MONITORS
ADJUSTMENTS
ARE
VERY
SENSITIVE
TO
SHIPPING
OVER
DISTANCES
WITH
ALL
THE
BUMPS
ROUGH
HANDLING
AND
SUCH
AND
THEREFORE
EXPECT
AND
AT
LEAST
IN
THEORY
REQUIRE
THAT
THE
LOCAL
DISTRIBUTOR
NOT
DEALER
HAVE
IT
ADJUSTED
AT
THE
LOCAL
SERVICE
CENTRE
BULL
HN
INFORMATION
SYSTEMS
IN
TORONTO
BEFORE
SALE
THIS
IS
THE
CORRECT
AND
PROBABLY
ONLY
WAY
OF
HAVING
ANY
CHANCE
OF
RECEIVING
A
PERFECT
MONITOR
THE
DEFINITION
OF
PERFECT
SEEMS
TO
DEPEND
ON
HOW
PICKY
ONE
IS
IN
MY
CASE
QUITE
ARE
OTHER
NETTERS
JUST
LIVING
WITH
THESE
KIND
OF
IMPERFECTIONS
I
FOR
ONE
WAS
NOT
WILLING
TO
ACCEPT
WHAT
I
CONSIDERED
A
SUBSTANDARD
MONITOR
AND
AFTER
TWO
MONTHS
OF
WRANGLING
AND
DIRECT
CONTACT
WITH
NEC
FINALLY
RECEIVED
A
SATISFACTORILY
ADJUSTED
MONITOR
NOT
PERFECT
IMHO
BUT
A
MAJOR
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
WHAT
THE
DEALER
AND
DISTRIBUTOR
WERE
TRYING
CONVINCE
ME
WAS
NORMAL
THE
SHORT
ANSWER
IS
NO
DONT
ACCEPT
THESE
IMPERFECTIONS
AS
NORMAL
BECAUSE
FOR
THE
PREMIUM
ONE
PAYS
FOR
THE
LARGER
SCREEN
MONITORS
ONE
HAS
A
RIGHT
TO
EXPECT
HIGHER
QUALITY
AND
IF
YOURE
PERSISTENT
YOULL
RECEIVE
IT
COMMENTS
AND
OPINIONS
ARE
MINE
NOT
