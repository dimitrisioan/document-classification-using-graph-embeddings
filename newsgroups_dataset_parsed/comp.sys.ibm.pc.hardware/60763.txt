TO
MY

DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
OF
A
COMPANY
THAT
SELLS
A
CARD
THAT
CAN
COEXIST
WITH
ANOTHER
ONE
ALL
I
REALLY
NEED
IS
COLOR
TEXT

ONE
MONITOR
AND
FAST
COLOR
GRAPHICS
ON
THE
OTHER
PROBABLY
JUST
A
CONFIGURABLE
ADDRESS
WOULD
DO
IT
FOR
WHAT
ITS
WORTH

HAVENT
CONFIRMED
IT
A
DIAMOND
TECHREP
TOLD
ME
THAT
ALL

AN

BE
AWARE
