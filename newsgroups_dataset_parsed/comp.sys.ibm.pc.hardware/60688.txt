reference
to
running
atis
install
program
and
using
its
functions
to
positionsize
images
at
various
resolutions
i
thought
this
was
a
neat
feature
until
i
noticed
that
when
an
image
is
resized
the
scanning
frequency
is
necessarily
changed
this
causes
digital
multiscan
monitors
like
my
mag
to
get
confused
as
to
which
mode
to
use
if
the
frequency
gets
too
far
from
the
standard
selections
for
this
reason
i
use
the
factory
defaults
for
positionsize
on
the
ati
card
and
adjust
each
mode
individually
only
the
first
time
at
the
monitor
the
mag
and
many
other
multiscan
monitors
has
have
the
ability
to
recall
these
settings
the
next
time
each
mode
is
detected
