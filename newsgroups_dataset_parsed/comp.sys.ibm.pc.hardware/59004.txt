i
opened
up

and
removed
all
the
other

no
help
there
then
not
having
anything
better
to
try
i
changed
normal
irq
to
delayed
irq
on
the
disk
controller
didnt
make
any
difference
and
iochrdynot
driven
to

also
had
no
effect
so
i
put
everything
back
to
the
way
it
was
and
reinstalled
the
cards
i
then
unplugged
the
floppy
drive
cable
from
the
disk
controller
voila
the
pc
booted
from
power
up
although
it
seemed
to
take
several
seconds
before
the
first
access
to
the
hard
disk
plug
the
floppy
cable
back
to
the
controller
and
the
original
nonboot
behavior
returns
ok
with
this
additional
information

any
words
of
wisdom
for
whats
going
on
