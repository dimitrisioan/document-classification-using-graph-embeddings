ORIGINAL
POSTER
JOHN
NAVITSKY
SAID
THAT
HE
MIGHT
USE
THE
MONITOR
ON
A
SPARCSTATION
LX
THE
LX
IS
ABLE
TO
GENERATE
A
PICTURE
AT
AT

NOT
OFFICIALLY
BUT
I
TRIED
TO
SET
THIS
RESOLUTION
AND
REFRESH
RATE
AND
THE
LX
CAME
UP
WITH
A
NONSYNCING
SCREEN
OUR
TUBE
OBVIOUSLY
COULDNT
HANDLE
THIS
SPEED
AT

IT
WORKED
PERFECTLY
I
DONT
KNOW
WHICH
TUBE
THE
VIEWSONIC
USES
BUT
IT
HAS
AN
HORIZONTAL
BANDWIDTH
SO
YOU
CAN
GO
PRETTY

I
RAN
MINE
AT

WAS

AS
THE
ORCHID
COULD

IT
ALSO
THE
DOES
CLAIM
TO
BE
ABLE

BUT
I
HAVE
NO

I
HAVE
BEEN
ABLE
TO

OUT
THIS
TRANSLATES

SEPARATE

FOR

HOW
THIS
MAKES
IT
EASY
TO
MATCH
FOR
PRINTER
OUTPUT
IS
BEYOND
ME
BUT
BEYOND
THE
HYPE
THE

IS
VERY
PLEASANT
TO
LOOK
AT
SHARP

AND
ISNT
NEARLY
AS
BAD
AS
THE
