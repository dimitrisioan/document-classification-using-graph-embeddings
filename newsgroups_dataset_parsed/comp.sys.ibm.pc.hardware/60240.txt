IVE
BEEN
INTENTLY
FOLLOWING
THE
MAG
THREAD
WHILE
WAITING
FOR
MINE
TO
ARRIVE
IN
THE
MAIL
THERE
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
LOT
OF
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
MINOR
ALIGNMENT
PROBLEMS
WITH
THE
ONE
ARTICLE
CONTAINED
A
COMMENT
THAT
THE
OWNER
CALLED
THE
FACTORY
AND
WAS
TOLD
THAT
HIS
SCREEN
ROTATION
WAS
WITHIN
SPEC
WELL
MY
MONITOR
ARRIVED
LAST
NIGHT
AND
SURE
ENOUGH
IT
HAS
A
VERY
NOTICABLE
BARREL
DISTORTION
ITS
NOT
DRAMATIC
BUT
IT
IS
THERE
AND
IT
IS
ESPECIALLY
NOTICABLE
WHEN
THE
IMAGE
DOESNT
FILL
THE
ENTIRE
SCREEN
THE
FACT
THAT
IT
IS
WORSE
ON
THE
RIGHT
SIDE
DOESNT
HELP
MATTERS
WHAT
IM
TRYING
TO
FIND
OUT
IS
IF
THESE
MINOR
IMPERFECTIONS
ARE
THE
NORM
OR
ARE
MOST
OF
THEIR
MONITORS
PERFECT
I
DONT
WANT
TO
SEND
IT
BACK
AND
GET
ONE
WITH
THE
SAME
OR
AN
EVEN
WORSE
PROBLEM
DOES
THE
FACTORY
CONSIDER
THIS
KIND
OF
THING
NORMAL
AND
SHIP
THEIR
MONITORS
WITH
LESS
THAN
PERFECT
ALIGNMENT
ARE
OTHER
NETTERS
JUST
LIVING
WITH
THESE
KIND
OF
IMPERFECTIONS
COMMENTS
AND
OPINIONS
ARE
MINE
