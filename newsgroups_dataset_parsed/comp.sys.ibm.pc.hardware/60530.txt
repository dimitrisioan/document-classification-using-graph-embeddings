i
cant
imagine
why
someone
would
leave
their
computer
on
all
of
the
time
to
start
with
its
like
leaving
your
lights
tv
radio
and
everything
in
the
house
on
all
of
the
time
to
menuts
we
have
plenty
of
computer
labs
where
the
computers
are
left
on
all
the
time
i
dont
see
any
shorter
lifespan
than
the
ones
we
have
in
the
offices
which
does
get
turned
off
at
the
end
of
the
day
in
fact
some
of
the
computers
in
the
labs
have
outlived
some
of
the
same
ones
in
the
offices
but
it
goes
both
ways
so
cant
conclude
anything
