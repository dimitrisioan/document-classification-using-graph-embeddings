help
needed
for
the
past
week
or
so
ive
been
trying
to
install
a
tape
drive
and
an
everex
full
size
controller
in
my
eisa
system
with
no
luck
i
end
up
getting
an
error
miscompare
during
the
streaming
read
part
of
the
test
i
am
pretty
certain
that
the
port
setting
irq
dma
are
set
properly
since
the
tape
responds
properly
to
all
commands
rewind
retension
write
and
erase
i
also
booted
the
system
clean
and
still
the
same
proble
so
i
also
tend
to
eliminate
any
memory
conflicts
it
has
been
suggested
that
my
bus
speed
is
too
fast
and
that
i
need
to
slow
it
down
my
system
has
an
ami
bios
and
i
dont
have
the
advanced
chip
setting
option
that
i
have
seen
on
other
systems
so
i
cant
do
this
am
i
going
to
have
to
accept
that
this
set
up
wont
work
or
can
anyone
suggest
a
work
around
i
will
be
glad
to
hear
your
advicesuggestions
tony
