collected

and
published
regularly
on

there
is
explicitly
no
warranty
that
the
given
settings
are
correct
or
harmless
i
only
collect
i
do
not
check
for
myself
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
the
settings
may
destroy
your
hardware
since
i
hope
however
that
only
wellminded
people
undergo
the
effort
of
posting
their
settings
the
chance
of
applicability
exists
if
you
should
agree
or
disagree
with
some
setting
let
me
know
immediately
in
order
to
update
the

if
you

please
mail

for

only

the

if

there
are
bioses
that
dont
even
ask
for
it
another
statement
maybe
right
ide

dont
have
precomp
and
lzone
the
precomp
is
a
builtin
parameter
and
lzone
isnt
used
because
most
if
not
every

has

the

names
are
given
as

often
only
a

number
means
the

a

means
that

a

i

the

described
as
a
master
in

the
drives
are
described
as

this
is
due
to
the
protocal

place
between
the

there
are
four

adjacent

this

this

an

the

of

chosen

will
be
in

dual

this

it
fallows
communication
across

indicating
to

the

this

that
