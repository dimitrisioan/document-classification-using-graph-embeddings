re
isa
bus
pin
question
re
diamond
speedstar
the
on
the
speedstar
is
for
those
systems
with
bootup
problems
if
your
system
fails
to
bootup
proprtly
please
pull
off
the
jumper
block
from
this
will
not
affect
the
proformance
of
the
speedstar
this
is
what
my
manual
says
about
i
never
knew
that
it
was
there
but
the
card
is
a
real
ask
kicker
in
my
book
it
beats
the
hell
out
of
my
junk
sony
to
the
point
that
i
cant
even
use
above
mode
muchsam
some
times
an
upgrage
turns
out
to
be
a
big
overkill
like
driving
a
sony
with
a
that
the
monitor
cant
handle
or
installing
simms
and
then
finding
out
that
your
mother
board
doesnt
have
a
cmos
wait
state
adjustment
to
take
advantage
of
the
new
simms
that
you
just
bought
goshi
think
i
just
installed
a
virusit
was
called
ms
dont
copy
that
floppyburn
iti
just
love
