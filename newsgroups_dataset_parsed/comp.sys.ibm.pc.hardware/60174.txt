HELP
WITH
FIXEDFREQUENCY
VGA
MONITOR
I
RECENTLY
BOUGHT
A
MONICHROME
VGA
MONITOR
FOR
THAT
WILL
DO
NONINTERLACED
WHICH
SEEMS
LIKE
A
GOOD
DEAL
HOWEVER
IT
IS
A
FIXEDSCAN
RATE
MONITOR
AND
ONLY
HANDLES
KHZ
HORIZONTAL
I
THINK
WITH
MY
TRIDENT
CARD
IT
WORKS
ONLY
IN
GRAPHICS
MODES
AND
NOT
MUCH
USE
SINCE
JUST
ABOUT
ANY
APPLICATION
WILL
SET
THE
MODE
TO
SOMETHING
ELSE
ESPECIALLY
IF
IT
WANTS
TO
DO
TEXT
I
SUPPOSE
ANYWAY
IS
THERE
ANY
WAY
THAT
I
CAN
USE
THIS
AS
A
GENERALPURPOSE
VGA
DISPLAY
WITH
A
TRIDENT
CARD
IF
NOT
CAN
I
DO
SO
WITH
SOME
SORT
OF
DIFFERENT
VGA
CARD
