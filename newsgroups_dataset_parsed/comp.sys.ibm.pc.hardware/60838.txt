WROTE
I
AM
INTERRESTED
IN
THE
EXTRODINARILY
SIMPLE
CONCEPT
OF
THE
NULL
MODEM
CABLE
ACTUALLY
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
SO
DONT
COUNT
THAT
LAST
STATEMENT
WHAT
IM
ASKING
IS
WHAT
PINS
DOES
IT
USE
OR
WHAT
ARE
ITS
SPECIFICATIONS
I
JUST
WANT
TO
SOLDER
ONE
MYSELF
INSTEAD
OF
BUYING
ONE
I
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
PORT
IS
USED
HELP
ME
PLEASE
AT
KEKIMMELLVAXCNSMUSKINGUMEDU
KEVIN
PS
IM
INTENDING
TO
USE
THE
CABLE
FOR
PCTOPC
TRANSFERS
VIA
LAPLINK
OR
TELIX
IDEAS
AND
INFO
GLADLY
ACCEPTED
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
SPECIFIC
KNOWLEDGE
OF
LAPLINK
OR
TELIX
BUT
MY
RECOMMENDATION
FOR
ANY
PACKAGE
IS
TO
FOLLOW
EACH
ONES
INSTRUCTIONS
FOR
MAKING
THE
NULL
MODEM
CABLE
THE
REASON
IS
THAT
EACH
ONE
MAY
BE
DIFFERENT
SINCE
THERE
ISNT
REALLY
A
STANDARD
FOR
PC
TO
PC
COMMUNICATIONS
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
A
TUTORIAL
I
WROTE
UP
THAT
WILL
GIVE
YOU
AN
UNDERSTANDING
ABOUT
AND
NULL
MODEMS
BUT
YOU
SHOULD
STILL
CHECK
YOUR
SOFTWARE
I
WILL
EPLAIN
A
COUPLE
OF
DETAILS
OF
IS
A
COMMUMICATIONS
SPECIFICATION
FOR
COMMUNICATING
BETWEEN
A
COMPUTER
AND
A
MODEM
ACTUALLY
IT
CAN
BE
BETWEEN
ANY
END
SYSTEM
AND
ANY
COMMUNICATIONS
HARDWARE
THE
TERMINOLOGY
USED
IS
DATA
TERMINAL
EQUIPMENT
DTE
AND
DATA
COMMUNICATIONS
EQUIPMENT
DCE
SPELLS
OUT
THE
VOLTAGE
LEVELS
THE
CONNECTOR
TYPE
THE
PINOUTS
AND
THE
SIGNAL
PROTOCOLS
THE
CONNECTOR
IS
A
BUT
IBM
HAS
SET
AN
ALTERNATIVE
STANDARD
OF
THE
PRIMARY
SIGNALS
ARE
TRANSMIT
DATA
TD
RECIEVE
DATA
RD
AND
SIGNAL
GROUND
SG
THERE
ARE
OTHER
SIGNALS
THAT
PROVIDE
CONTROL
BETWEEN
THE
DTE
AND
THE
DCE
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
DTE
ANNOUNCES
THAT
IT
IS
POWERED
UP
AND
READY
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
COMMUNICATIONS
VIA
THE
DATA
TERMINAL
READY
DTR
SIGNAL
DTR
IS
AN
OUTPUT
ON
THE
DTE
AND
AN
INPUT
ON
THE
DCE
SIMILARLY
THE
DCE
ANNOUNCES
THAT
IT
IS
READY
TO
PARTICIPATE
IN
COMMUNICATIONS
VIA
THE
DATA
SET
READY
DSR
SIGNAL
DSR
IS
AN
INPUT
ON
THE
DTE
AND
AN
OUTPUT
ON
THE
DCE
OK
THATS
FIVE
SIGNALS
THERE
ARE
ONLY
FOUR
MORE
OF
INTEREST
THE
REQUEST
TO
SEND
RTS
SIGNAL
IS
AN
OUTPUT
FROM
THE
DTE
AND
AN
INPUT
TO
THE
DCE
THAT
IS
USED
TO
ASK
THE
DCE
PERMISSION
TO
SEND
DATA
IF
THE
DCE
AGREES
IT
SENDS
AN
OK
VIA
THE
CLEAR
TO
SEND
CTS
SIGNAL
FOR
COMPLETENESS
THE
CTS
IS
AN
INPUT
TO
THE
DTE
AND
AN
OUTPUT
FROM
THE
DCE
THE
OTHER
TWO
SIGNALS
OF
INTEREST
ARE
RING
INDICATOR
RI
AND
DATA
CARRIER
DETECT
DCD
THESE
ARE
BOTH
INPUTS
TO
THE
DTE
AND
OUTPUTS
FROM
THE
DCE
RI
IS
JUST
WHAT
YOU
WOULD
EXPECT
A
SIGNAL
TO
THE
DTE
SAYING
THAT
SOMEONE
IS
ATTEMPTING
TO
ESTABLISH
A
CONNECTION
TO
THE
DCE
THIS
IS
RATHER
SPECIFIC
TO
THE
MODEM
TELEPHONE
LINE
SETUP
DCD
IS
A
WAY
FOR
THE
DCE
TO
ANNOUNCE
THAT
THE
CONNECTION
HAS
BEEN
ESTABLISHED
IE
THE
LOCAL
DCE
IS
TALKING
TO
SOME
REMOTE
DCE
THERE
THATS
IT
OH
THERE
ARE
MANY
OTHER
SIGNALS
DEFINED
BUT
THEY
ARE
OBSOLETE
I
HAVE
EXPLAINED
THE
NINE
SIGNALS
THAT
ARE
ON
A
PC
THE
PINOUTS
ARE
AS
FOLLOWS
NAME
SG
TD
RD
DTR
DSR
DCD
RTS
CTS
RI
NOW
TO
ADDRESS
YOUR
PROBLEM
AT
HAND
WHEN
YOU
CONNECT
A
PC
TO
A
PC
A
DTE
TO
A
DTE
THERE
IS
NO
DCE
PAIR
IN
THE
MIDDLE
AND
THEREFORE
THE
SIGNAL
DEFINITIONS
DONT
WORK
OUT
QUITE
RIGHT
THERE
IS
NO
DCE
TO
ASSERT
THE
CTS
DSR
DCD
OR
RI
SO
THE
COMMON
THING
TO
DO
IS
TO
NOT
USE
THESE
SIGNALS
AT
ALL
AND
ALSO
FORGET
ABOUT
THE
DTR
AND
RTS
OUTPUTS
AS
WELL
IF
THIS
IS
DONE
YOU
SIMPLY
MAKE
A
NULL
MODEM
A
CABLE
THAT
PASSES
THROUGH
SG
AND
CROSSES
TD
AND
RD
IE
PIN
OF
ONE
END
CONNECTS
TO
PIN
AT
THE
OTHER
END
ETC
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
THIS
SOLUTION
IS
THAT
A
PC
THAT
WANTS
TO
SEND
DATA
HAS
NO
WAY
OF
KNOWING
IF
THE
OTHER
PC
IS
READY
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
JUST
SEND
THE
DATA
AND
HOPE
IT
GOT
THROUGH
THEREFORE
A
BETTER
NULL
MODEM
WOULD
INCLUDE
THE
DTRDSR
PAIR
CROSSED
A
PARTICULAR
POINT
A
CONFUSION
IS
IN
THE
SOFTWARE
AREA
JUST
BECAUSE
YOU
RUN
THE
WIRES
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THE
SOFT
WARE
WILL
USE
THEM
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
THE
BUILTIN
BIOS
TO
CONTROL
THE
SERIAL
PORT
THEN
THE
BIOS
DICTATES
WHAT
WIRES
YOU
NEED
AND
HOW
THEY
ARE
TO
BE
USED
BUT
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
COMM
PACKAGE
SUCH
AS
BROOKLYN
BRIDGE
OR
LAP
LINK
OR
TELIX
THEN
THOSE
PACKAGES
DICTATE
THE
CABLING
REQUIREMENTS
THE
ONLY
THING
YOU
CAN
GUESS
RELIABLY
IS
THE
SG
TD
AND
RD
THE
DTRDSR
IS
ALSO
FAIRLY
COMMON
THERE
IS
ONE
MORE
ISSUE
THAT
NEEDS
TO
BE
ADDRESSED
HERE
AND
THAT
IS
FLOW
CONTROL
IN
THE
SCENERIO
THE
DCES
ARE
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
FLOW
CONTROL
AND
IT
IS
ASSUMED
THAT
THE
DCE
COULDNT
POSSIBLE
OVERRUN
THE
DTE
BY
THIS
I
MEAN
THAT
AS
LONG
AS
THE
DTE
HAS
ITS
DTR
LINE
ASSERTED
THE
DCE
WILL
SEND
DATA
WITHOUT
REQUESTING
PERMISSION
FIRST
NOTE
THE
CONTRAST
TO
THE
OTHER
DIRECTION
OF
DATA
FLOW
THE
DTE
MUST
REQUEST
PERMISSION
BY
ASSERTING
THE
RTS
LINE
AND
IT
MUST
WAIT
FOR
THE
CTS
SIGNAL
BEFORE
IT
CAN
SEND
AND
NOW
IN
THE
DTE
TO
DTE
SCENERIO
THE
QUESTION
IS
DO
YOU
NEED
FLOW
CONTROL
THE
ANSWSER
IS
USUALLY
BUT
HOW
FOR
NONBINARY
COMMUNICATIONS
ONE
COMMON
TECHNIQUE
IS
XON
XOFF
WHICH
IS
IMPLEMENTED
IN
SOFTWARE
NO
WIRES
ARE
DEDICATED
TO
FLOW
CONTROL
THE
TD
AND
RD
CARRY
THE
XON
AND
XOFF
COMMANDS
THIS
TYPE
OF
FLOW
CONTROL
CAN
BE
USED
IN
ADDITION
TO
HARDWARE
FLOW
CONTROL
BUT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
YOU
CANT
SEND
BINARY
DATA
BECAUSE
YOUR
DATA
MIGHT
INCLUDE
THE
XON
OR
XOFF
CODES
AND
CAUSE
ERRONEOUS
CONROL
SIGNALS
A
WORK
AROUND
IS
TO
HAVE
THE
SOFTWARE
INSERT
AND
EXTRACT
ESCAPE
CODES
BUT
THE
HARDWARE
FLOW
CONTROL
IS
PREFERED
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
HARD
WARE
FLOW
CONTROL
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
STANDARD
THERE
ARE
LOTS
OF
WAYS
TO
DO
IT
AND
I
BET
THEY
HAVE
ALL
BEEN
TRIED
ONE
CORNERSTONE
OF
ALL
THE
METHODS
IS
TO
USE
THE
RTSCTS
FOR
ONE
DIRECTION
BUT
BEYOND
THAT
ANYTHING
IS
FAIR
GAME
AGAIN
YOU
MUST
LOOK
TO
YOU
COMM
PACKAGE
FOR
CABLING
REQUIREMENTS
BUT
I
BET
YOULL
FIND
THAT
ONE
CABLE
IF
WIRED
PROPERLY
COULD
WORK
WITH
ALL
OF
THE
PACKAGES
AS
LONG
AS
THEY
ARE
OF
THE
SAME
VINTAGE
BY
THE
WAY
I
AM
FAMILIAR
WITH
ONE
PACKAGE
THAT
USES
RTSCTS
AND
DTRDSR
FOR
FLOW
CONTROL
THE
RTS
IS
REQUEST
TO
SEND
AND
THE
DTR
IS
READY
TO
RECIEVE
THE
CTS
IS
THE
CLEAR
TO
SEND
AND
THE
DSR
IS
THE
REQUEST
TO
RECIEVE
THIS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
A
DIFFERNT
CABLE
IT
IS
JUST
SOFTWARE
THE
CLINCHER
TO
ALL
OF
THIS
CABLING
STUFF
IS
THAT
IT
IS
COMMON
TO
HAVE
THE
UART
DIRECTLY
CONTROLLED
BY
THE
CTS
SIGNAL
WHICH
MEANS
THAT
THE
CTS
MUST
BE
PRESENT
EVEN
IF
YOU
ARE
NOT
SUPPORT
ING
IT
IN
SOFTWARE
FOR
THESE
CASES
YOU
WILL
FIND
CABLES
THAT
SHORT
THE
RTS
TO
THE
CTS
AT
THE
SAME
END
OR
PERHAPS
THE
DTR
TO
THE
CTS
OTHER
POSSIBLE
SHORTING
MIGHT
BE
DONE
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
SOFTWARE
EXPECTS
CERTAIN
SIGNALS
THAT
YOU
DONT
HAVE
OR
DONT
FEEL
LIKE
PROVIDING
BECAUSE
IT
WOULD
MEAN
ADDITIONAL
WIRES
SPECIFICALLY
I
AM
TALKING
ABOUT
THE
DSR
SHORTING
THE
DTR
TO
THE
DSR
IS
NOT
A
GOOD
IDEA
IN
GENERAL
BUT
YOU
MAY
FIND
CABLES
LIKE
THIS
IT
IS
A
BAD
IDEA
BECAUSE
IT
DEFEATS
THE
WHOLE
PURPOSE
ONE
MORE
GOTCHA
SIGNAL
IS
THE
DCD
SOME
SOFTWARE
INCLUDING
THE
PC
BIOS
EXPECTS
TO
SEE
THE
DCD
BEFORE
IT
WILL
WORK
THIS
SIGNAL
SOMETIMES
GETS
SHORTED
WITH
THE
DTR
BUT
MY
FAVORITE
NULL
MODEM
HAS
THE
RTS
AND
CTS
SHORTED
AT
EACH
END
BUT
THE
RTS
IS
ALSO
CONNECTED
THROUGH
TO
THE
OTHER
END
AND
CONNECTED
TO
DCD
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
DTRDSR
ARE
CROSSED
AS
ARE
THE
TDRD
AND
OF
COURSE
THE
SG
MUST
PASS
THROUGH
THIS
NULL
MODEM
WORKS
WITH
MOST
SOFTWARE
THE
FLOW
CONTROL
IF
ANY
CAN
USE
THE
RTSDCD
WITH
THE
DTRDSR
IF
YOUR
COMM
PACKAGE
DOES
NOT
SPECIFY
THE
CABLE
REQUIRED
FOR
PC
TO
PC
CONNECTION
THEN
I
SUGGEST
YOU
USE
THIS
