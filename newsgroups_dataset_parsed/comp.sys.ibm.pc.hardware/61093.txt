RE
BIOS
PASSWORDS
SOME
OF
OUR
STUDENTS
CHANGE
THE
AMI
BIOS
PASSWORDS
ON
A
FEW
OF
OUR
COMPUTERS
AND
SET
IT
FOR
ALWAYS
WHAT
WED
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IS
IF
THERE
IS
A
WAY
TO
BYPASS
OR
REMOVE
THE
PASSWORD
WE
HAVE
TRIED
SWITCHING
BIOS
BUT
TO
NO
AVAIL
THE
BATTERY
IS
SOLDERED
TO
THE
BORD
AN
ALL
THREE
MACHINES
IS
STILL
UNDER
GUARENTEE
SO
IF
THAT
WOULD
HAVE
HELP
WE
CANT
REMOVE
THE
BATTERIES
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
GET
AROUND
THE
BIOS
PASSWORD
EXCEPT
BY
SHORTING
OUT
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
TO
THE
CMOS
MEMORY
THEREBY
ERASING
IT
THIS
WILL
REMOVE
THE
PASSWORD
BUT
IT
WILL
ALSO
DESTROY
ALL
THE
PREVIOUS
BIOS
SETTINGS
SO
THEN
YOULL
HAVE
TO
GO
AND
SET
THEM
ALL
UP
AGAIN
ON
MY
THERE
IS
A
JUMPER
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
WHICH
IS
PROVIDED
FOR
THE
PURPOSE
OF
SHORTING
THE
BATTERY
YOU
JUST
SHORT
THIS
JUMPER
BRIEFLY
AND
IT
INTERRUPTS
POWER
TO
THE
CMOS
LONG
ENOUGH
TO
ERASE
IT
I
WOULD
IMAGINE
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
LIKE
THIS
ON
YOUR
BOARD
TOO
IN
THE
FUTURE
I
WOULD
SUGGEST
THAT
YOU
SET
THE
PASSWORD
AND
LEAVE
IT
ON
SETUP
ONLY
THAT
WAY
NOONE
ELSE
CAN
GO
AND
RESET
IT
OR
SET
IT
TO
ALWAYS
UNLESS
THEY
KNOW
WHAT
PASSWORD
YOU
USED
THEY
HAD
TO
DO
THIS
OVER
HERE
TOO
WHEN
THEY
GOT
A
BUNCH
OF
NEW
FOR
JUST
THE
SAME
REASON
