IM
KIND
OF
NEW
AT
THE
PC
STUFF
MY
MACHINE
HAS
SERIAL
PORTS
COM
AND
SHARE
SAME
IRQS
YOU
MEAN
I
CANT
PLUG
A
MOUSE
INTO
AND
A
MODEM
INTO
AND
EXPECT
BOTH
TO
WORK
NO
BUT
SOME
OSS
COHERENT
ETC
ARE
ABLE
TO
DRIVE
ONE
OF
THE
PORTS
IN
POLLED
MODE
WITHOUT
USING
THE
IRQ
IN
YOUR
EXAMPLE
AFTER
ACCESSING
THE
MODEM
THE
MOUSE
WONT
WORK
UNTIL
YOU
REBOOT
BECAUSE
THE
IRQ
IS
USED
BY
THE
MODEM
IF
ANSWER
IS
NO
SHOULD
I
CHANGE
IRQS
FOR
COM
PORTS
TO
BE
DIFFERENT
AND
DOES
IT
REALLY
MATTER
WHICH
IRQ
I
SET
THE
PORTS
TOO
YES
YOU
CAN
CHANGE
THE
IRQS
FOR
BUT
IT
DEPENDS
ON
YOUR
OTHER
HARDWARE
USES
IF
YOU
HAVE
ONLY
ONE
PRINTERPORT
YOU
CAN
CHANGE
TO
NORMALLY
PRINTER
FOR
YOU
CAN
ASSIGN
IF
ITS
FREE
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
NO
OTHER

CAN
BE
USED
UNTIL
