how
much
should
i
pay
for
a

also
i
seem
to
remember
a
posting
saying
that
the
scsi
spec
calls
for
foot
between
devices
on
the
cable
but
most
cables
you
get
internal
dont
meet
the
spec

ii
draft
proposal
rev
section
singleended
cable
which
is
in
the
cable
requirements
section
has
an
implementors
note
stub
clustering
should
be
avoided
stubs
should
be
spaced
at
least
meters
apart
for
the
nontechnical
stubs
are
scsi
devices
however
also
be
aware
that
implementors
notes
are
basicly
recommendations
they
are
not
part
of
the
spec
as
others
have
noted
many
vendors
including
sgi
violate
this
indeed
the
main
point
is
to
reduce
impedance
changes
and
therefore
reflections
and
therefore
noise
on
the
bus
let
no
one
tell
me
that
silence
gives
consent
