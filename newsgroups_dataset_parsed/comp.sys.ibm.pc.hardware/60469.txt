scan
rate
vs
font
size
this
past
winter
i
found
myself
spending
a
ridiculous
amout
of
time
in
front
of
my
computer
since
my
eyes
were
going
berserk
i
decided
to
shell
out
some
serious
money
to
upgrade
from
a
to
a
monitor
im
running
at
hz
my
eyes
are
very
grateful
however
i
find
myself
using
a
smaller
font
with
less
eye
strain
has
anyone
else
had
this
kind
of
experience
i
thought
that
small
fonts
were
the
culprit
but
it
seems
that
flicker
was
my
real
problem
any
