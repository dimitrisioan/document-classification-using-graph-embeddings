THIS
PAST
WINTER
I
FOUND
MYSELF
SPENDING
A
RIDICULOUS
AMOUT
OF
TIME
IN
FRONT
OF
MY
COMPUTER
SINCE
MY
EYES
WERE
GOING
BERSERK
I
DECIDED
TO
SHELL
OUT
SOME
SERIOUS
MONEY
TO
UPGRADE
FROM
A
TO
A
MONITOR
IM
RUNNING
AT
HZ
MY
EYES
ARE
VERY
GRATEFUL
HOWEVER
I
FIND
MYSELF
USING
A
SMALLER
FONT
WITH
LESS
EYE
STRAIN
HAS
ANYONE
ELSE
HAD
THIS
KIND
OF
EXPERIENCE
I
THOUGHT
THAT
SMALL
FONTS
WERE
THE
CULPRIT
BUT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
FLICKER
WAS
MY
REAL
PROBLEM
