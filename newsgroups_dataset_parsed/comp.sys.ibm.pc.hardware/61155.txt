WRITES
I
MUST
SAY
THAT
I
HAVE
BEEN
A
CUSTOMER
OF
MIDWEST
MICRO
FOR
OVER
YEARS
NOW
AND
HAVE
BEEN
WELL
TAKEN
CARE
OF
ON
EACH
PURCHASE
I
HAVE
HAD
MANY
FRIENDS
THAT
HAVE
BOUGHT
THAT
SAME
MODEM
AND
THEY
DO
HAVE
SOME
EXPERIENCE
WITH
SETTING
UP
MODEMS
SO
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
NO
PROBLEMS
IN
OF
THEM
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
THE
FACT
THAT
YOUR
TIME
TO
VALUABLE
FOR
YOU
TO
SPEND
ON
THE
MODEM
IS
WHERE
YOU
WENT
WRONG
WHY
YOU
SAY
BECAUSE
I
MUST
TELL
YOU
OF
THE
YES
I
SAY
PPI
MODEMS
THAT
I
HAVE
HAD
IN
THE
PAST
THAT
I
WAS
TRYING
TO
USE
ON
MY
BBS
THEY
ALL
WERE
JUNK
AND
WERE
REPLACE
TIMES
EACH
TO
THER
POINT
THAT
I
JUST
SAID
FORGET
IT
AND
I
WANTED
MY
MONEY
BACK
PPIS
TECK
EVEN
SAID
THAT
THEY
DIDNT
EVEN
REPAIR
THEM
THAT

JUST
STRIP
THE
PARTS
THAT

GOOD
AND
JUNK
THR
REST
OF

PS
I
CONSIDER
MIDWASTE
MICROS
TECHNIQUE
OF
SLAPPING
THEIR
OWN
NAME
ON
A
PRODUCT
TO
BE
MISLEADING
ESPECIALLY
IF

WAS
NOT
ORIGINALLY
MANUFACTURED
WITH
THAT
INTENT
IN
