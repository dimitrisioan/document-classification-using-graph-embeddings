and
noisy
lines
hi
i
just
got
a
problem
i
have
a
cheapo
modem
which
i
use
to
connect
to
my
university
but
i
get
too
much
garbage
on
the
screen
i
do
know
its
because
the
noise
in
the
line
i
can
actually
hear
it
so
my
question
is

to
eliminate
this
garbage
my
modem

have
any
of
these
on
hardware

the
trick
thanks
