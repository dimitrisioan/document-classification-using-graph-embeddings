ADAPTEC
PROBLEM
HELLO
I
HAVE
RECENTLY
SUFFERED
FROM
VARIOUS
PROBLEMS
CONCERNING
AN
ADAPTEC
CONTROLLER
PROBLEM
FLOPPY
DISK
DRIVE
DOESNT
WORK
THERES
APPARENTLY
AT
LEAST
TWO
JUMPERS
ON
THE
CONTROLLER
THAT
AFFECT
THE
FLOPPY
DISK
DRIVE
UNFORTUNATELY
I
HAVE
LOCATED
ONLY
ONE
OF
THEM
IN
THE
LOWER
FRONT
CORNER
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
IF
THERE
ARE
ANY
OTHER
SUCH
JUMPERS
AND
POSSIBLY
WHERE
THEY
ARE
LOCATED
PROBLEM
MY
HARD
DISKS
REFUSE
TO
BOOT
WITH
MY
TWO
SCSI
HDS
RODIME
MINISCRIBE
I
GET
A
MESSAGE
MISSING
OPERATING
SYSTEM
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
DISKS
HAVE
BEEN
FORMATTED
WITH
THE
SAME
CONTROLLER
AND
THEY
DAMN
SURE
HAVE
AN
OPERATING
SYSTEM
ON
THEM
IF
I
BOOT
FROM
A
QUANTUM
I
MIGHT
GET
AS
FAR
AS
GETTING
THE
MSDOS
VERSION
INFORMATION
THIS
MIGHT
OF
COURSE
BE
DUE
TO
INCOMBATIBLE
MEMORY
DRIVERS
ARE
THERE
ANY
JUMPERS
THAT
COULD
AFFECT
THE
HD
CAUSING
SUCH
ERRORS
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
