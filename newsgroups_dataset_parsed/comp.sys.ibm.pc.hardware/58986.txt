SCSI
HELP
HOWDY
SORRY
IF
THIS
HAS
BEEN
COVERED
BEFORE
ONE
OF
MY
PC
ILLITERATE
FRIENDS
ASKED
ME
TO
HELP
HIM
INSTALL
DRDOS
ON
HIS
NEC
POWERMATE
SX
OF
COURSE
I
SAID
NO
PROBLEM
AND
WENT
TO
WORK
UNFORTUNATELY
THE
DRDOS
REFUSES
TO
RECOGNIZE
THE
HARD
DRIVE
DURING
INSTALLATION
EVEN
THOUGH
I
AM
STILL
ABLE
TO
BOOT
OFF
OF
THE
HARD
DRIVE
USING
THE
OLD
DOS
AFTER
OPENNING
IT
UP
I
DISCOVERED
IT
WAS
USING
AN
SEAGATE
SCSI
CONTROLLER
ON
A
SCSI
DRIVE
I
THEN
BOOTED
WITH
DRDOS
OFF
OF
THE
FLOPPY
A
SECOND
TIME
AND
RAN
FDISK
TO
SEE
IF
I
COULD
ACCESS
THE
DRIVE
LO
AND
BEHOLD
THE
PRIMARY
MBYTE
PARTITION
WAS
INTACT
CREATED
BY
DOS
NO
LESS
I
DIDNT
THINK
YOU
COULD
GO
OVER
A
PARTITION
IN
THE
OLDER
DOSES
I
COULD
BE
WRONG
I
THEN
TRIED
TO
REMOVE
THE
PRIMARY
PARTITION
WHICH
IT
WOULDNT
ALLOW
ME
TO
DO
I
AM
UNAWARE
OF
ANYTHING
SPECIAL
THAT
HAS
TO
BE
DONE
WITH
A
SCSI
DRIVE
I
KINDA
EXPECTED
IT
TO
WORK
JUST
LIKE
AN
IDEMFMRLL
DRIVE
FOR
DOS
INSTALLATIONS
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
EXCEPT
FOR
THROW
IT
IN
THE
GARBAGE
AND
BUY
A
NEW
PC
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
PAUL
MR
SCSI
NOT
FINCKE
