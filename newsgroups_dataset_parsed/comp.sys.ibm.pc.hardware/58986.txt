scsi
help
howdy
sorry
if
this
has
been
covered
before
one
of
my
pc
illiterate
friends
asked
me
to
help
him
install
drdos
on
his
nec
powermate
sx
of
course
i
said
no
problem
and
went
to
work
unfortunately
the
drdos
refuses
to
recognize
the
hard
drive
during
installation
even
though
i
am
still
able
to
boot
off
of
the
hard
drive
using
the
old
dos
after
openning
it
up
i
discovered
it
was
using
an
seagate
scsi
controller
on
a
scsi
drive
i
then
booted
with
drdos
off
of
the
floppy
a
second
time
and
ran
fdisk
to
see
if
i
could
access
the
drive
lo
and
behold
the
primary
mbyte
partition
was
intact
created
by
dos
no
less
i
didnt
think
you
could
go
over
a
partition
in
the
older
doses
i
could
be
wrong
i
then
tried
to
remove
the
primary
partition
which
it
wouldnt
allow
me
to
do
i
am
unaware
of
anything
special
that
has
to
be
done
with
a
scsi
drive
i
kinda
expected
it
to
work
just
like
an
idemfmrll
drive
for
dos
installations
any
suggestions
would
be
greatly
appreciated
except
for
throw
it
in
the
garbage
and
buy
a
new
pc
thanks
in
advance
