JOYSTICKS
IS
SLOW
IM
USING
TO
READ
MY
JOYSTICK
AND
IT
IS
HIDEOUSLY
SLOW
SOMETHING
LIKE
OF
MY
CPU
TIME
IS
BEING
SPENT
READING
THE
JOYSTICK
AND
THIS
IS
IN
A
PROGRAM
THAT
DOES
NOTHING
BUT
PRINTF
AND
JOYREAD
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
A
LOT
OF
PROGRAMS
TRAP
LIKE
SMARTDRV
AND
SO
IT
IS
A
SLOW
AS
HELL
INTERFACE
CAN
I
READ
THE
JOYSTICK
PORT
IN
A
REASONABLY
SAFE
FASHION
VIA
POLLING
AND
THAT
ISNT
PLATFORM
OR
CLOCKSPEED
