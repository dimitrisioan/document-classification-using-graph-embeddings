F
CARR
WRITES
IM
RUNNING
LINUX
ON
AN
EISA
SYSTEM
AND
IM
HAVING
WHAT
I
THINK
ARE
HARDWARE
PROBLEMS
IT
COULD
BE
SOFTWARE
BUT
I
DONT
SEE
WHY
ID
BE
THE
ONLY
ONE
HAVING
TROUBLE
ID
LIKE
SOME
ADVICE
ON
HOW
BEST
TO
DEBUG
THIS
THE
SYMPTOM
WHEN
I
TRY
TO
BUILD
GCC
I
GET
UNPREDICTABLE
AND
UNREPEATABLE
RESULTS
SOMETIMES
A
O
FILE
IS
NOT
IN
VALID
AOUT
FORMAT
RECOMPILING
THE
FILE
GIVES
ME
A
VALID
BINARY
SOMETIMES
THE
COMPILER
ABORTS
OR
DUMPS
CORE
BUT
WORKS
FINE
WHEN
RUN
AGAIN
WITH
THE
SAME
INPUT
COMPILING
THE
SAME
SOURCE
FILES
WITH
THE
SAME
ARGUMENTS
GIVES
SLIGHT
DIFFERENCES
IN
A
FEW
OBJECT
FILES
NOTE
THAT
LINUX
UNLIKE
MANY
OTHER
SYSTEMS
DOES
NOT
PUT
TIMESTAMPS
IN
OBJECT
FILES
SO
COMPILING
TWICE
SHOULD
GIVE
BITIDENTICAL
RESULTS
I
ALSO
HAVE
OCCASIONAL
FILESYSTEM
CORRUPTION
ON
MY
SCSI
DRIVE
BUT
THAT
COULD
BE
CAUSED
BY
USING
DEVELOPMENT
SOFTWARE
IT
COULD
ALSO
BE
RELATED
TO
MY
PROBLEMS
COMPILING
THE
COMPILE
PROBLEMS
ARE
NOT
CAUSED
BY
DISK
PROBLEMS
I
GET
THE
SAME
RESULTS
WHETHER
I
DO
MY
WORK
ON
AN
IDE
OR
SCSI
DISK
IVE
SET
THE
MEMORY
SPEED
AND
CACHE
WRITE
SPEED
TO
THE
RECOMMENDED
VALUES
RECOMMENDED
FOR
WHAT
DOS
THAT
IS
A
JUNK
I
SUSPECT
THE
EXTERNAL
CACHE
BUT
I
HAVE
NO
REAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
THIS
THE
MOTHERBOARD
IS
A
NICE
SUPEREISA
WITH
KB
WRITEBACK
CACHE
AND
A
MHZ
PROCESSOR
WHAT
IM
LOOKING
FOR
A
SYSTEM
TEST
PROGRAM
TO
RUN
UNDER
DOS
OR
LINUX
LINUX
GCC
FIRE
UP
GCC
TO
COMPILE
LIBC
AND
KERNEL
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
RUNNING
SUGGESTIONS
ABOUT
THE
CAUSE
OF
THE
PROBLEM

BAD
