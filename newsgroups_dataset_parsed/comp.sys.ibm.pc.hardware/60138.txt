TRY
A
BIOS
LEVEL
FORMAT
VIA
THE
DEBUG
COMMAND
WHERE
XXXX
IS
THE
HEX
ADDRESS
OF
THE
HD
CONTROLLER
BIOS
LOCATION
IF
THIS
WILL
NOT
WORK
A
LAST
RESORT
WOULD
BE
TO
TAKE
A
LARGE
MAGNET
TO
THE
HARD
DISK
BUT
THIS
HAS
TO
BE
DONE
PROPERLY
OR
YOU
WILL
CAUSE
OR
COULD
CAUSE
MORE
DAMAGE
THAN
HAS
BEEN
DONE
ALREADY
DISCLAIMER
I
AM
NOT
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
YOUR
ACTIONS
BY
DIRECTLY
APPLYING
A
LARGE
MAGNET
TO
YOUR
HARD
DISK
IF
DONE
CORRECTLY
THE
MAGNET
TRICK
WILL
WIPE
OUT
EVERYTHING
ON
THE
HARD
DISK
COMPLETELY
AND
A
LOW
LEVEL
BIOS
FORMAT
MIGHT
SUCCEED
