WROTE
FIRST
OF
ALL
PLEASE
EDIT
YOUR
POSTINGS
WADING
THROUGH
LINES
OF
QUOTED
CRUD
WHICH
PEOPLE
HAVE
ALREADY
READ
MAKES
PEOPLE
MUCH
LESS
LIKELY
TO
HELP
YOU
OF
COURSE
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
BE
HELPED
THATS
YOUR
PROBLEM
IS
THIS
TRUE
I
WAS
UNDER
THE
IMPRESSION
THAT
PEOPLE
ON
THE
NET
HAD
BOTH
SCSI
AND
IDE
WORKING
TOGETHER
NO
ITS
NOT
TRUE
YOU
CAN
GET
SCSI
AND
IDE
TO
WORK
TOGETHER
BUT
THERE
ARE
RESTRICTIONS
AT
LEAST
WITH
THE
ADAPTEC
YOU
MUST
BOOT
FROM
THE
IDE
DRIVE
THERE
IS
NO
WAY
TO
BOOT
FROM
THE
SCSI
DRIVE
IF
YOU
HAVE
BOTH
IDE
AND
SCSI
DRIVES
YOU
MUST
DISABLE
THE
SCSI
ROM
BIOS
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
THIS
THOUGH
AND
SO
YOU
MUST
ALSO
USE
SOME
SPECIAL
DRIVERS
TO
ACCESS
THE
SCSI
DRIVE
HMM
I
KNOW
THAT
YOU
HAVE
TO
DISABLE
SOMETHING
RELATED
TO
THE
SCSI
BIOS
BUT
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
IT
IS
THE
ROM
ITSELF
BACK
IN

SOMEONE
ASKED
ABOUT
IDE
AND

THIS
QUESTION
GETS
ASKED
AGAIN

HIM
ALL

IS
IT
WORTH
IT
TO

OVER

WILL
THERE
BE

DECREASE
IN

TIMEINCREASE
IN

RATE
FOR

APPLICATIONS
ISABASED
SCSI
AND

CONTROLLERS
GENERALLY
HAVE
COMPARABLE

YOU
MIGHT
GET
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
THROUGHPUT
WITH
A
SCSI
DISK
BUT
YOULL
ALSO
PAY
MORE
FOR
THE
DISK
AND
UP
IN
SOME
CASES
YOULL
ALSO
PAY
MUCH
MUCH
MORE
FOR
A
GOOD

SCSI
CONTROLLERS
REALLY
SHOW
THEIR
POWER
IF
THEYRE
USED
WITH

MULTITASKING
OPERATING

A

UNFORTUNATELY
NEITHER
MSDOS
NOR
WINDOWS
IS
A
GOOD

THE
PERFORMANCE
ADVANTAGE
OF
SCSI
CONTROLLERS
IS
MOSTLY
WASTED
WITH
THESE
WHICH
LEAVES
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
BEING
ABLE
TO
CONNECT
MULTIPLE
DEVICES
TO
THE

BUS
AS
THE
ONLY
ADVANTAGE
HOWEVER

YOU
CAN
EXPECT
TO
PAY
A

GOING

NO
GENERALLY

OF

THE

ARE
REALLY
WITH

OF

EG
NO

HOWEVER
ADDING
A

IS
WHAT
BRINGS
THESE
PROBLEMS
TO
THE

AND
MAKES
THEM
VISIBLE
SCSI
HOLDS
A

OF

BUT
YOU
CAN
RUN
INTO
A

OF

COMPATIBILITY
PROBLEMS

STICK
WITH

IF
YOU

YOULL
HAVE

A

MORE
THAN

WILL
PROBABLY
GIVE
YOU
EXCELLENT
PERFORMANCE
AT
THE
POSSIBLE

OF

COMPATIBILITY
I
SAY
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
WHILE
I
KNOW
THIS
TO
BE
TRUE
WITH
A

I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
REALLY
WILL
BE
TRUE
OF

I
SUSPECT
THAT
IT
WILL
BUT
I
DONT

FOR
