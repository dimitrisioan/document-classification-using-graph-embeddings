of

please
edit
your

wading
through
lines
of
quoted
crud
which
people
have
already
read
makes
people
much
less
likely
to
help
you
of
course
if
you
dont
want
to
be
helped
thats
your
problem
is
this
true
i
was
under
the
impression
that
people
on
the
net
had
both
scsi
and
ide
working
together
no
its
not
true
you
can
get
scsi
and
ide
to
work
together
but
there
are
restrictions
at
least
with
the
adaptec
you
must
boot
from
the
ide
drive
there
is
no
way
to
boot
from
the
scsi
drive
if
you
have
both
ide
and
scsi
drives
you
must
disable
the
scsi
rom
bios
im
not
sure
about
this
though
and
so
you
must
also
use
some
special
drivers
to
access
the
scsi
drive
hmm
i
know
that
you
have
to
disable
something
related
to
the
scsi
bios
but
im
not
sure
if
it
is
the
rom
itself
back
in
february
someone
asked
about
ide
and
scsi
this
question
gets
asked
again
and
again
at
the
end
of
this

ive
included

all

is
it
worth
it
to
get
scsi

ide
will
there
be
a
noticable
decrease
in
access
timeincrease
in
xfer
rate
for
msdos
applications
isabased
scsi
and
ide
controllers
generally
have
comparable
throughput
you
might
get
slightly
higher
throughput
with
a
scsi
disk
but
youll
also
pay
more
for
the
disk
and
up
in
some
cases
youll
also
pay
much
much
more
for
a
good
scsi
controller
note
that
good
scsi
controllers
really
show
their
power
if
theyre
used
with
a
good
multitasking
operating
system
like
a
pc
unix
unfortunately
neither
msdos
nor
windows
is
a
good
multitasking
operating
system
the
performance
advantage
of
scsi
controllers
is
mostly
wasted
with
these
which
leaves
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
connect
multiple
devices
to
the
scsi
bus
as
the
only
advantage
however
note
that
you
can
expect
to
pay
a
premium
for
scsi
devices
if
youre
only
going
to
be
using
msdos
stick
with
ide
its
cheaper
and
youll
have
less
headaches
will
virtually
any
scsi
device
chain
into
the
controller
for
my
harddrive
bernoulli
box
cdrom
tape
drive
etc
note
the
following
is
true
for
msdoswindows
only
who
knows
what
the
future
holds
for
windows
nt
and
unix
no
generally
you
have
to
find
drivers
for
each
scsi
device
which
probably
dont
exist
unless
youre
using
one
of
the
betterhigh
performance
scsi
controllers
these
are
typically
busmastering
scsi
controllers
that
cost
around
street
prices
and
up
and
drivers
that
allow
you
to
connect
these
controllers
to
popular
namebrand
scsi
devices
either
come
with
the
card
or
can
be
purchased
for
under
list
price
examples
of
such
driver
kits
are
adaptecs
ez
scsi
kit
list
this
works
only
with
adaptec
scsi
controllers
corelscsi
from
the
same
people
who
make
coreldraw
list
this
driver
kit
will
supposedly
work
with
any
scsi
controller
card
that
has
an
aspi
driver
like
the
adaptec
central
points
pc
tools
for
dos
supports
a
number
of
scsi
tape
drives
the
documentation
lists
tape
drives
unfortunately
it
works
only
with
adaptec
controllers
are
there
likely
to
be
other

equipment
yes
you
will
run
into
problems
if
youre
using
a
highperformance
busmastering
scsi
controller
this
doesnt
sound
right
doesnt
it
its
true
though
with
one
of
these
controllers
youll
probably
have
to
tweak
your
system
to
get
it
to
work
with
sound
cards
floppycontrollerbased
tape
drives
like
the
cms
jumbo
and
windows
i
know
ive
been
to
hll
and
back
getting
my
scsi
controller
to
work
with
various
hardwaresoftware
thank
god
for
tape
backups
if
you

send

these
problems
arent
really
the
fault
of
the
scsi
controller
card
the
problems
are
really
with
the
general
hardware
and
software
design
of
the
pc
eg
no
standards
however
adding
a
busmastering
scsi
card
is
what
brings
these
problems
to
the
surface
and
makes
them
visible
scsi
holds
a
lot
of
promise
but
you
can
run
into
a
lot
of
pc
compatibility
problems
if
youre
planning
on
using
only
msdoswindows
stick
with
ide
if
you
want
to
use
windows
nt
or
a
pc
unix
youll
have
to
make
some
hard
decisions
a
good
scsi
controller
and
more
than
one
scsi
hard
disk
will
probably
give
you
excellent
performance
at
the
possible
cost
of
msdos
compatibility
i
say
probably
because
while
i
know
this
to
be
true
with
a
pc
unix
i
dont
know
if
this
really
will
be
true
of
windows
nt
i
suspect
that
it
will
but
i
dont
know
for
sure
