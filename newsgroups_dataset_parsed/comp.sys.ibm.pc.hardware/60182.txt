RE
WHAT
IS
AT
BUS
CLK
SPEED
IN
ARTICLE
ROBERT
DESONIA
WRITES
S
THERE
IS
ONE
PARAM
IN
THE
BIOS
SETUP
THAT
SAYS
AT
BUS
CLK
I
HAVE
CLOCK
WHICH
IS
BEYOND
ISA
SPECS
BUT
MAY
BE
OK
IF
ALL
OF
THE
CARDS
CAN
RUN
THAT
FAST
I
WOULD
SET
IT
TO
IN
FACT
I
DID
AND
SET
IT
BACK
IF
ANYTHING
ACTS
WEIRD
EG
YOU
GET
UNEXPLAINABLE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
ERRORS
YOUR
MODEM
LOCKS
UP
YOU
HAVE
VIDEO
PROBLEMS
ETC
IF
YOU
OVERDRIVE
THE
AT
BUS
THEN
THAT
SHOULD
BE
THE
FIRST
THING
TO
CHECK
IF
YOU
GET
AN
ERROR
ON
YOUR
SYSTEM
IT
IS
PRETTY
SAFE
TO
OVERDRIVE
YOUR
AT
BUS
AS
LONG
AS
YOUR
ISA
CARDS
STILL
WORK
FLAWLESSLY
I
SUGGEST
BACKING
UP
YOUR
HD
BEFORE
PLAYING
WITH
IT
THOUGH
ON
MY
REALLY
NOT
MY
AT
BUS
IS
SET
TO
AT
MHZ
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEMS
SOUNDBLASTER
PRO
ZOOM
FXM
RLL
CONTROLLER
ETC
ALL
WORK
FINE
IF
I
SET
IT
TO
MHZ
I
SIMPLY
DONT
GET
PAST
THE
POST
ROUTINES
I
DOUBT
YOU
COULD
ACTUALLY
DAMAGE
MUCH
BY
PLAYING
WITH
IT
