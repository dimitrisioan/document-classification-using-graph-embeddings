HOW
LONG
DO
MONITORS
LAST
WELL
MY
VGA
YEAR
OLD
NO
BRAND
MONITOR
JUST
BIT
THE
BULLET
I
PRESSED
THE
POWER
SWITCH
AND
A
FEW
SECONDS
LATER
THE
POWER
LIGHT
WENT
OUT
WITH
A
POP
GAWD
ITS
ONLY
BEEN
TWO
AND
HALF
YEARS
HOW
LONG
WOULD
NORMAL
MONITORS
LAST
I
THINK
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
MY
MONITOR
IS
THE
POWER
SWITCH
BUT
THE
IMAGE
WAS
GETTING
PRETTY
DIM
ANYWAY
I
NEEDED
TO
HAVE
MY
CONTRAST
ALL
THE
WAY
TO
THE
MAX
AND
THE
SCREEN
DID
FLICKER
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
IS
THIS
NORMAL
HEHEHE
OR
DO
I
JUST
HAVE
THE
WORST
OF
LUCK
QUESTION
WHAT
DO
I
DO
NOW
BUY
A
NEW
ONE
GET
IT
FIXED
SAVE
UP
FOR
A
REALLY
GOOD
ONE
AND
GET
BY
WITH
A
CHEAP
EGA
MONITOR
FOR
NOW
I
RATHER
SAVE
MY
MONEY
TO
UPGRADE
MY
TO
THOUGH
THANKS
WHAT
ENGINEERS
SAY
EXTENSIVE
EFFORT
IS
BEING
APPLIED
ON
A
FRESH
APPROACH
TO
THE
PROBLEM
WHAT
THEY
REALLY
MEAN
WE
JUST
HIRED
THREE
NEW
GUYS
WELL
LET
THEM
KICK
IT
AROUND
FOR
A
WHILE
