how
long
do
monitors
last
well
my
vga
year
old
no
brand
monitor
just
bit
the
bullet
i
pressed
the
power
switch
and
a
few
seconds
later
the
power
light
went
out
with
a
pop
gawd
its
only
been
two
and
half
years
how
long
would
normal
monitors
last
i
think
the
problem
with
my
monitor
is
the
power
switch
but
the
image
was
getting
pretty
dim
anyway
i
needed
to
have
my
contrast
all
the
way
to
the
max
and
the
screen
did
flicker
from
time
to
time
is
this
normal
hehehe
or
do
i
just
have
the
worst
of
luck
question
what
do
i
do
now
buy
a
new
one
get
it
fixed
save
up
for
a
really
good
one
and
get
by
with
a
cheap
ega
monitor
for
now
i
rather
save
my
money
to
upgrade
my
to
though
thanks
what
engineers
say
extensive
effort
is
being
applied
on
a
fresh
approach
to
the
problem
what
they
really
mean
we
just
hired
three
new
guys
well
let
them
kick
it
around
for
a
while
