IT
POSSIBLE
TO
PLUG
IN
OR
SIMMS
INTO
A
MOTHERBOARD
SAYING
BKWANTS
SIMMS
YOU
SHOULDNT
HAVE
TROUBLES
I
HAVE
HEARD
OF
MACHINES
HAVING
PROBLEMS
WITH
SLOWER
THAN
RECOMMENDED
MEMORY
SPEEDS
BUT
NEVER
FASTER
IT
SHOULD
RUN
WITHOUT
ANY
TROUBLE
OF
COURSE
BUT
WHY
DO
YOU
WANT
TO
BUY
SOME
AND
MIXED
THEM
WITH
IS
MORE
EXPENSIVE
THAN
AND
FURTHERMORE
YOUR
MACHINE
WILL
RUN
THE
SLOWEST
SIMMS
CLOCK
SPEED
EVENTHOUGH
YOU
HAVE
JUST
MY
THOUGHT
YOUR
MACHINE
WILL
RUN
AT
WHATEVER
THE
BUS
IS
JUMPERED
TOCMOS
IS
SET
TO
USUALLY
WAIT
STATES
REGARDLESS
OF
WHAT
SPEED
RAM
IS
INSTALLED
NO
MOTHERBOARD
CAN
SENSE
THE
SPEED
OF
THE
RAM
INSTALLED
UNLESS
YOU
CALL
FAILING
AS
A
SORT
OF
AUTOSENSE
THIS
IS
HOW
YOU
CAN
SOMETIMES
USE
SLOWER
RAM
IN
A
MACHINE
YOU
EITHER
SET
THE
NUMBER
OF
WAIT
STATES
TO
ACCOMODATE
THE
SLOW
RAM
IN
WHICH
CASE
ALL
MEMORY
WILL
RUN
AT
THAT
SLOWER
RATE
OR
YOU
REDUCE
THE
WAIT
STATES
AND
TAKE
THE
CHANCE
THAT
THE
SLOWER
RAM
WILL
ACT
LIKE
FASTER
RAM
AND
YOU
WONT
CRASH
PUTTING
FASTER
RAM
IN
WONT
SPEED
THINGS
UP
UNLESS
YOU
TELL
THE
MACHINE
IT
HAS
FASTER
RAM
MIXING
FAST
AND
SLOW
RAM
WILL
NOT
HELP
YOU
IF
YOU
HAVE
TO
KEEP
THE
BUS
SLOWED
DOWN
TO
ACCOMODATE
SLOW
RAM
