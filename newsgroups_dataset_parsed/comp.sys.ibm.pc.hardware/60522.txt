i
ordered
a
ati
ultra
pro
and
im
pretty
sure
the
is
really
there
because
i
can
select
but
no
matter
what
i
do
with
the
flex
program
in
the
atis
program
group
remains
ghosted
out
i
have
windows
build
of
the
drivers
dos
the
drivers
were
installed
by
gateway
not
by
me
so
perhaps
theres
a
file
missing
from
the
hard
drive
it
runs
just
fine
i
did
go
into
the
desktop
window
and
select
sometimes
it
refuses
ghosted
out
other
time
it
accepts
it
but
when
i
hit
ok
and
reenter
desktop
its
back
to
at
no
time
does
it
unghost
in
the
main
flex
window
help
maybe
you
need
to
go
into
and
set
a
refresh
rate
for
you
might
need
to
use
custom
monitor
option
