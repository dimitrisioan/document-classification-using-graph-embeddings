i
wont
argue
that
the
scsi
standard
makes
for
a
good
well
implimented
data
highway
but
i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bus
when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
i
have
been
following
this
thread
and
figured
id
throw
in
my
two
cents
the
amiga
zorro
ii
bus
is
comparable
with
the
isa
bus
vs
mhz
except
for
the
fact
that
its
superior
in
just
about
every
way
to
the
isa
bus
the
amiga
has
had
a
preemptative
multitasking
os
since
and
can
operate
with
mb
ram
scsi
is
used
almost
exclusively
on
these
systems
except
for
the
new
systems
that
now
ship
only
with
ide
controllers
