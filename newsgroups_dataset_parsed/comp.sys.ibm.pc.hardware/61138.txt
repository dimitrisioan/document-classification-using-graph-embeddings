THIS
IS
A
SILLY
QUESTION
BUT
HERE
GOES
WHAT
IS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
US
ROBOTICS
COURIER
EXTERNAL
AND
THE
SPORTSTER

SEE
THAT
THE
PRICE
OF
A
SPORTSTER
HAS
DRAMATICALLY
DROPPED
TO
BELOW
BUT
THE
PRICE
OF
THE
COURIER
REMAINS
ABOVE
ANYONE
WITH
KNOWLEDGE
OF
BOTH
OF
THESE
MODEMS
OR
ANYONE
THAT
OWNS
A
COURIER

APPRECIATE
