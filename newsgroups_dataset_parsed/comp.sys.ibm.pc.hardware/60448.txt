much
discussion
about
switching
and
drives
removed
another
albeit
strange
option
is
using
a
program
like
ii
available
via
anonymous
ftp
at
many
major
sites
or
fdformat
also
available
via
anonymous
ftp
that
allows
you
to
format
disks
to
or
disks
to
along
with
many
many
other
formats
so
you
can
diskcopy
yes
the
broken
messydos
diskcopy
the
disks
onto
disks
or
vice
versa
i
use
this
techniques
with
nondos
selfbooting
game
disks
on
my
old
tandy
and
it
works
another
program
named
teledisk
sharewareavailable
on
many
major
bbss
will
also
make
the
weird
format
disks
provided
you
have
ii
or
fdformat
installed
some
disks
that
wont
diskcopy
properly
can
be
readily
telediskd
into
the
proper
format
at
least
this
is
a
software
solution
for
a
hardwarebios
deficiency
