I
AM
RIGHT
NOW
WORKING
ON
AN
MPRII
CERTIFIED
SWEDISH

FOR

HITACHI
SUPERSCAN
MONITOR
ITS
UP
TO
AT
THAT
RES
AND
IT
GOT
A
GOOD
WRITEUP
FOR
IMAGE
QUALITY
IN
A
RECENT
FEB
ISSUE
OF
PC
MAGAZINE
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
VERY
LITTLE
FULLY
MATCHES
A
NEC
IN
IMAGE
QUALITY
AT
LEAST
ACCORDING
TO
THE
MAGS
I
CANT
TELL
ANY
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
BUT
I
THINK
NEC
IS
LOW
EMISSIONS
ON
ONLY
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
TYPES
THERES
VLF
VERY
LOW
FREQUENCY
AND
ELF
I
THINK
THATS
EXTREMELY
LOW
FREQUENCY
THE
MPRII
STANDARDS
SET
STRICT
LIMITS
ON
BOTH
BUT
MANY
COMAPNIES
NEC
INCLUDED
ACCORDING
TO
ONE
ARTICLE
I
READ
I
GET
A
BUNCH
OF
MAGS
SO
ITS
HARD
FOR
ME
TO
REMEMBER
WHICH
WHICH
CLAIM
LOW
EMISSIONS
BUT
NOT
SPECIFICALLY
MPRII
COMPLIANT
OR
MPRII
CERTIFIED
ONLY
CONTROL
FOR
ONE
USUALLY
VLF
AND
IGNORE
THE
OTHER
SO
THE
NEC
PROBABLY
HAS
HIGHER
OVERALL
IMAGE
QUALITY
I
CONSIS
TENTLY
HEAR
IT
RATED
AS
THE
BEST
OR
CLOSE
TO
THE
BEST
BUT
NOT
AS
LOW
EMISSIONS
AS
THE
HITACHI
I
LIKE
MY
IMAGE
QUALITY
BUT
FOR
ALL
I
KNOW
YOU
MAY
BE
MORE
DISCERNING
GOOD
LUCK
MITCH
OH
YEAH
I
GOT
