WRITES
HI
THERE
WE
JUST
BOUGHT
A
GATEWAY
SYSTEM
WITH
A
MEG
ATI
ULTRA
PRO
VIDEO
CARD
EVERYTHING
SEEMS
TO
WORK
FINE
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
WINDOWS
DRIVERS
FOR
BIT
AND
AND
BIT
MODES
THE
FONTS
AND
ICONS
START
DETERIORATING
AFTER
WINDOWS
STARTUP
AND
WITHIN
MINUTES
OF
USE
EVERYTHING
ON
THE
SCREEN
IS
TOTALLY
UNINTELLIGIBLE
NATURALLY
I
CALLED
GATEWAY
TECH
SUPPORT
TO
INQUIRE
ABOUT
THIS
THE
TECHNICIAN
ASKED
ME
ABOUT
THE
DRIVERS
AND
I
TOLD
HIM
IT
WAS
VERSION
BUILD
HE
TOLD
ME
THAT
THE
AND
BIT
DRIVERS
FOR
THE
ATI
ULTRA
PRO
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
WORK
IS
THIS
TRUE
IF
SO
IM
SIMPLY
AMAZED
HOW
COULD
THIS
BE
THE
STRANGE
THING
IS
I
WOULD
HAVE
EXPECTED
TO
SEE
SOME
DISCUSSION
ON
HERE
UNLESS
THE
SUBJECT
HAS
MADE
THE
FAQ
ONE
VERY
SUSPICIOUS
POINT
THAT
CAME
UP
LATER
WAS
THAT
HE
STATED
THAT
NONE
OF
THE
WINDOWS
ACCELERATOR
BOARDS
HAVE
WORKING
ANDOR
BIT
DRIVERS
FOR
WINDOWS
I
EASILY
CHALLENGED
HIM
ON
THAT
BECAUSE
IVE
BEEN
RUNNING
A
DIAMOND
IN
BIT
MODE
AT
HOME
FOR
MONTHS
NOW
AND
I
HAVE
TESTED
AND
USED
THE
BIT
MODE
AS
WELL
HE
THEN
BACKED
OFF
AND
SAID
WELL
DIAMOND
HAS
BEEN
WORKING
ON
THOSE
DRIVERS
MUCH
LONGER
ANYWAY
I
JUST
WANTED
TO
SEE
IF
ANYONE
ELSE
HAD
ANY
TROUBLE
AND
WHAT
THEY
DID
ABOUT
IT
ANY
FEEDBACK
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED

ON
MY

ALTHOUGH
MY

IS

YOURS
IT
SOUNDS

YOU
MAY

I
HAVE
HEARD
RUMORS

THEY
