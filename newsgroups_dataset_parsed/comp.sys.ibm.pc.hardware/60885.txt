WRITES
SO
WHEN
YOUVE
GOT
MULTITASKING
YOU
WANT
TO
INCREASE
PERFORMANCE
BY
INCREASING
THE
AMOUNT
OF
OVERLAPPING
YOU
DO
ONE
WAY
IS
WITH
DMA
OR
BUS
MASTERING
EITHER
OF
THESE
MAKE
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
IO
DEVICES
TO
MOVE
THEIR
DATA
INTO
AND
OUT
OF
MEMORY
WITHOUT
INTERRUPTING
THE
CPU
THE
ALTERNATIVE
IS
FOR
THE
CPU
TO
MOVE
THE
DATA
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
SCSI
INTERFACE
CARDS
THAT
ALLOW
DMA
AND
BUS
MASTERING
HOW
DO
YOU
DO
BUSMASTERING
ON
THE
ISA
BUS
AS
AN
EARLIER
POST
NOTED
THROUGH
DMA
IDE
HOWEVER
IS
DEFINED
BY
THE
STANDARD
AT
INTERFACE
CREATED
FOR
THE
IBM
PC
AT
WHICH
REQUIRES
THE
CPU
TO
MOVE
ALL
THE
DATA
BYTES
WITH
NO
DMA
IF
WERE
TALKING
ISA
AT
BUS
HERE
THEN
YOU
CAN
ONLY
HAVE
DMA
CHANNEL
ACTIVE
AT
ANY
ONE
TIME
PRESUMABLY
TRANSFERRING
DATA
FROM
A
SINGLE
DEVICE
SO
EVEN
THOUGH
YOU
CAN
HAVE
AT
LEAST
DEVICES
ON
A
SCSI
BUS
EXPLAIN
HOW
ALL
OF
THOSE
DEVICES
CAN
TO
DMA
TRANSFERS
THROUGH
A
SINGLE
SCSI
CARD
TO
THE
ISAAT
BUS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
ANY
ONE
TIME
MEANS
IMHO
A
SINGLE
BYTE
XFER
IF
I
HAVE
FOUR
SOURCES
OF
DMA
REQUESTS
READY
THE
DMA
WOULD
SERVICE
THE
ONE
AFTER
THE
OTHER
IF
THE
BANDWIDTH
FOR
THE
FOUR
TOGETHER
IS
LOWER
THAN
THE
ISADMA
BANDWIDTH
THIS
WILL
WORK
NOTE
THAT
THE
BUS
MASTERING
HERE
IS
THE
PRIORITY
MECHANISM
IN
THE
