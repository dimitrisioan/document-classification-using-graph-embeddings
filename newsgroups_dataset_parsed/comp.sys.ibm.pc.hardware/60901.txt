hello
i
have
a
diamond
stealth
vram
card
the
older
version
with
the
dip
switches
on
the
back
i
have
two
problems
ive
lost
the
manual
i
have
it
in
a
machine
with
a
network
card
and
everything
works
fine
until
i
run
windows
when
the
network
connection
dies
in
case
its
important
the
network
card
is
an
smc
arcnet
compatable
card
its
io
address
is
and
its
ram
base
address
is
its
also
using
irq
remainder
deleted
i
dont
have
my
copy
of
the
manual
with
me
right
now
but
i
can
offer
the
following
in
the
interim
the
card
uses
port
addresses
and
which
are
not
configurable
these
addresses
incidentally
were
inadvertantly
omitted
from
my
version
of
the
manual
i
believe
there
is
a
dip
that
controls
whether
or
not
to
enable
irq
for
cga
or
ega
support
