i
have
a
gateway
with
a
floppy
the
drive
only
reads
files
it
wrote
to
the
floppy
floppies
that
have
been
formatted
and
contain
files
from
other
machines
are
unreadable
also
floppies
that
were
written
by
this
defective
floppy
drive
a
long
time
ago
are
also
unreadable
this
sounds
like
a
head
alignment
problem
too
right
it
does
how
does
one
go
about
fixing
it
are
there
alignment
screws
that
you
can
adjust
the
very
very
first
thing
you
do
is
make
sure
that
all
files
on
the
floppies
that
you
can
currently
read
in
the
drive
which
arent
already
on
your
hd
or
another
floppy
if
you
have
two
floppy
drives
get
copied
to
your
hd
andor
to
a
floppy
in
your
other
drive
if
you
dont
do
this
before
fixing
the
alignment
problem
you
have
kissd
those
files
goodbye
well
you
can
try
to
remisalign
the
drive
back
to
read
your
floppies
but
dont
count
on
be
able
to
do
so
generally
head
alignment
is
something
id
only
trust
to
a
good
repair
shop
though
there
arehave
been
