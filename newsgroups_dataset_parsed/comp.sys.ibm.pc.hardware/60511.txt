i
have
a

on
an

although
my
machine
is
vlb
i
has
the
save
transfer
rate
of
mbs
regardless
of
the
variations
of
the
isa
bus
speed
i
tested
it
with
speed
between
and
not
any
difference
the
problem
is
not
the
interface
between
the
controller
and
the
memory

id
still
like
to
here
from
people
with
vlbide
i
still
want
to
know
what
vlb
bus
speed
is
used
with
ide
drives
i
still
want
to
know
if
some
most
ide
drives
can
handle
bus
speeds

i
recently
bought
a
micron
vlb
computer
and
the
the
local
bus
ide
card
was
getting
around
transfer
rates
says
norton
i
caled
micron
because
this
seemed
pathetically
slow
and
they
said
that
norton
doesnt
recognize
local
bus
and
wont
give
accurate
results
i
was
told
i
would
need
norton
in
order
to
get
a
true
account
of
my
ide
transfer
speed
i
didnt
really
like
this
answer
in
part
because
the
drive
doesnt
seem
as
though
its
cranking
along
at
much
more
than
that
but
i
also
dont
know
if
i
could
tell
the
difference
i
tried
playing
around
with
settings
in
the
cmos
bus
speed
at
the
like
and
noticed
no
significant
change
in
performance
