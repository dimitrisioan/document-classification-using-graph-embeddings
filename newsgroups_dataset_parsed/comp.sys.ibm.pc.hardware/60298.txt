isa
limit
i
was
just
reading
in
pc
magazine
that
the
peripherals
in
a
pc
with
an
isa
bus
can
only
access
of
memory
also
that
some
video
cards
on
the
isa
bus
look
for
a
memory
aperture
to
map
their
memory
to
so
that
if
i
wanted
to
put
of
memory
on
my
pc
my
video
card
wouldnt
have
anywhere
to
map
its
memory
to
can
someone
explain
this
in
more
detail
is
there
a
way
around
this
limit
