WRITES
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
GETTING
THE
PULSE
OF
THIS
GROUP
REGARDING
EXTENDED
OPERATION
OF
MY
WITH
THE
COVER
REMOVED
FROM
THE
ENCLOSURE
THERE
ARE
A
OF
REASONS
I
AM
CONSIDERING
THIS
INCLUDING
QUICK
ACCESS
TO
JUMPERS
DURING
COMPLEX
IO
CARD
SETUPS
MY
CONCERN
IS
THAT
WITHOUT
A
COMPLETE
ENCLOSURE
TO
DIRECT
THE
COOLING
FLOW
OF
AIR
FROM
THE
FAN
HOT
SPOTS
MAY
DEVELOP
ON
MY
MOTHERBOARD
OR
ELSEWHERE
MY
HAS
INTAKE
AIR
VENTS
IN
THE
FRONT
OF
THE
ENCLOSURE
RIGHT
AT
MB
LEVEL
THESE
VENTS
WOULD
BE
REMOVED
ALONG
WITH
THE
TOP
COVER
IN
THIS
SCENARIO
RENDERING
AIRFLOW
FROM
THE
FAN
PRETTY
USELESS
HOWEVER
SHORT
PERIODS
IN
THIS
MODE
DONT
SEEM
TO
HEAT
THINGS
UP
TOO
MUCH
BUT
MY
CONCLUSIONS
ARE
FAR
FROM
SCIENTIFIC
TIM
I
RAN
A
OUT
OF
A
CARDBOARD
BOX
FOR
MORE
THAN
A
YEAR
WITH
NO
MAJOR
EFFECTS
YEAH
NO
CASE
AT
ALL
MB
SITTING
ON
A
STATIC
BAG
OTHER
THAN
THE
NOISE
FROM
THE
POERSUPPLY
IT
RAN
PRETTY
GOOD
AS
FOR
COOLING
PROBLEMS
I
BOUGHT
A
INCH
FAN
AND
TURNED
IT
ON
FULL
AND
SET
THE
OUTPUT
DIRECTLY
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
I
DID
FINALLY
GET
A
CASE
THOUGH
AND
I
AM
STILL
RUNNING
THE
PARTS
WITH
NO
ILL
EFFECTS
I
ALSO
HAD
NO
KIDS
TO
SPILL
THINGS
ON
THE
MB
I
HAD
NO
CAT
LEAVING
HAIR
ON
THE
MB
ETC
ETC
ON
AND
ON
THE
TWO
MAJOR
CONCERNS
ARE
KEEPING
STATIC
AWAY
AND
KEEPING
THE
MB
COOL
