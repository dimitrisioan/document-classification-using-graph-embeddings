help
with
hicolor
modes
can
any
body
tell
me
where
the
most
significant
bit
of
the
total
horizontal
width
hides
out
on
the
tseng
labs
with
a
bit
dac
i
am
trying
to
use
the
mode
under
unix
so
i
cant
just
call
int
have
a
program
which
dumps
the
contents
of
the
card
registers
under
dos
but
i
am
not
sure
i
trust
it
for
the
extended
registers
of
the
anyway
the
problem
is
that
in
this
mode
the
horizontal
total
register
is
apparently
set
to
but
index
the
displayed
clocks
is
set
to
so
is
nonsense
a
resonable
value
would
be
so
is
there
a
high
bit
and
if
so
where
is
it
also
how
does
one
set
the
video
dot
clock
to
the
appropriate
frequency
and
what
would
be
an
appropriate
frequency
the
documentation
isnt
really
very
clear
tsengtxt
from
from
some
ftp
site
about
this
my
card
is
a
card
seems
to
have
a
tseng
labs
bios
ver
i
think
works
nicely
under
dos
and
very
well
under
unix
linux
in
all
the
nonhicolor
modes
great
for
running
xwindows
in
up
to
if
your
monitor
will
take
it
only
just
in
my
case
please
email
the
answer
as
i
cant
read
news
very
often
thanks
very
much
david
