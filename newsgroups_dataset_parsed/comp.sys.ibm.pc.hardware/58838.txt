another
happy
gateway
owner
since
ive
been
seeing
all
kinds
of
complaints
regarding
gateways
lately
on
here
i
thought
i
post
my
recent
pleasant
experiences
my
machine
this
past
friday
this
was
two
weeks
to
the
day
from
when
i
called
the
order
in
upon
unboxing
it
i
found
everything
to
be
in
perfect
order
all
the
peripherals
i
ordered
were
properly
installed
cdrom
i
was
very
impressed
with
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
gateway
documentation
all
software
came
with
the
original
disks
and
manuals
the
gateway
manual
itself
is
in
a
nice
binder
the
ati
gup
came
with
drivers
all
other
software
i
specified
microsoft
office
was
properly
installed
the
machine
came
right
up
out
of
the
box
and
has
been
performing
flawlessly
its
been
on
all
weekend
and
it
hardly
even
reaches
room
temperature
i
think
the
big
roomy
tower
case
has
a
lot
to
do
with
it
its
up
and
running
dos
with
no
problems
ive
also
read
about
some
people
having
problems
with
high
speed
serial
communications
i
used
the
dos
interlink
program
which
lets
me
link
to
my
old
computer
via
a
serial
port
at
baud
it
then
maps
the
other
machines
two
hard
disks
as
my
disks
f
g
you
can
cd
to
these
drives
and
either
run
programs
or
copy
files
its
almost
like
a
peerpeer
lan
except
you
can
also
run
programs
on
the
other
machine
its
not
a
two
way
street
the
other
machine
is
the
server
and
this
machine
is
the
client
so
thats
where
it
seems
to
differ
from
the
peer
to
peer
stuff
for
a
bundled
dos
utility
its
very
impressive
my
took
about
minutes
to
back
up
of
data
i
also
bypassed
any
potential
gateway
monitor
problems
by
taking
the
credit
and
applying
it
towards
a
nec
i
love
this
monitor
so
im
glad
there
is
some
good
news
gateway
stories
and
im
glad
it
was
me
now
if
it
just
keeps
working
