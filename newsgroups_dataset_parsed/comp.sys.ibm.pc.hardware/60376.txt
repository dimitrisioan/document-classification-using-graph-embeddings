WRITES
BUT
I
STILL
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHY
IT
INTRINSICALLY
BETTER
THAN
IDE
ON
AN
ISA
BUS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MULTITASKING
OSS
WHEN
MANAGING
DATA
FROM
A
SINGLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
A
SCSI
CONTROLLER
THAT
TRANSFERS
DATA
BY
DMA
ALLOWS
THE
CPU
TO
REQUEST
DATA
FROM
THE
HARD
DRIVE
AND
CONTINUE
WORKING
WHILE
THE
CONTROLLER
GETS
THE
DATA
AND
MOVES
IT
TO
MEMORY
IDE
ALSO
USES
DMA
TECHNIQUES
I
BELIEVE
FLOPPY
CONTROLLER
ALSO
USES
DMA
AND
MOST
AD
BOARDS
ALSO
USE
DMA
DMA
IS
NO
BIG
DEAL
AND
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
DIRECTLY
WITH
SCSI
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHEN
REWINDING
OR
FORMATTING
A
TAPE
THE
COMMAND
IS
ISSUED
TO
THE
CONTROLLER
AND
THE
BUS
IS
RELEASED
TO
ALLOW
ACCESS
TO
OTHER
DEVICES
ON
THE
BUS
THIS
GREATLY
INCREASES
PRODUCTIVITY
OR
AT
LEAST
DO
SOMETHING
ELSE
WHILE
BACKING
UP
YOUR
HARD
DRIVE
WHICH
HAPPENS
TO
BE
WHAT
I
AM
DOING
WHILE
READING
THIS
GROUP
YOU
CAN
THANK
YOUR
SOFTWARE
FOR
THAT
IF
DOS
HAD
A
FEW
MORE
BRAINS
IT
COULD
FORMAT
FLOPPIES
ETC
WHILE
YOU
WERE
DOING
SOMETHING
ELSE
THE
HARDWARE
WILL
SUPPORT
IT
BUT
DOS
AT
LEAST
WONT
AGAIN
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
SCSI
ITS
A
LONG
STORY
BUT
I
STILL
USE
IDE
ON
MY
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
CDROM
WHICH
THANKS
TO
SCSI
I
CAN
MOVE
BETWEEN
BOTH
MACHINES
IF
AND
WHEN
SCSI
IS
BETTER
STANDARDIZED
AND
SUPPORTED
ON
THE
IBMCLONE
MACHINES
I
PLAN
TO
COMPLETELY
GET
RID
OF
IDE
AND
IF
YOU
STICK
WITH
DOS
YOULL
WONDER
WHY
YOU
CANT
MULTITASK
AGAIN
I
ASK
WHY
CANT
A
UNIX
OR
TYPE
OS
DO
ALL
THE
MIRACULOUS
THINGS
WITH
AN
IDE
HARDDRIVE
THAT
IT
CAN
WITH
A
SINGLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
