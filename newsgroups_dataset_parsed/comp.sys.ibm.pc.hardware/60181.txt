DREAM
HI
I
HAVE
AN
ORCHID
FAHRENHEIT
VLB
WITH
OF
DRAM
IT
IS
AN
BASED
CARD
I
HAD
A
PROBLEM
FOR
A
WHILE
AFTER
INSTALLING
MY
SECOND
MEG
OF
DRAM
FOR
THE
VIDEO
AND
THANKS
TO
ORCHID
I
GOT
A
FIX
FROM
THEIR
TECH
SUPPORT
IT
WAS
JUMPER
SETTINGS
NOT
GIVEN
IN
THE
ORDINARY
MANUAL
I
ASSUME
IT
WOULD
COME
WITH
MEMORY
ORDERED
FROM
THEM
SO
I
GUESS
I
SHOULD
BE
GLAD
THEY
DIDNT
JUST
SAY
BUY
THE
MEMORY
FROM
US
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
THE
ONE
THING
THAT
I
WAS
PUZZLED
BY
WAS
WHY
THERE
WAS
NOT
A
COLOR
MODE
ON
THE
THING
EITHER
IN
FULL
SCREEN
OR
ENLARGED
DESKTOP
MODE
MY
ATI
ULTRA
PLUS
CAN
HANDLE
THAT
GIVEN
OF
MEMORY
ALL
THE
BUYS
YOU
ON
THE
FAHRENHEIT
IS
JUST
ONE
MORE
MODE
GEEZ
HAD
I
KNOWN
I
WOULDNT
HAVE
BOTHERED
I
ASKED
THEM
WHY
AND
ALL
I
GOT
WAS
YOUR
POINT
IS
WELL
TAKEN
BUT
ORCHIDS
SOFTWARE
DEVELOPERS
ARE
BUSY
WITH
OTHER
PROJECTS
SO
TO
GET
TO
THE
POINT
FINALLY
ARE
THERE
ANY
DRIVERS
OUT
THERE
THAT
CAN
HANDLE
HIGH
RES
HICOLOR
MODES
ID
LOVE
TO
GET
ANOTHER
CARD
BUT
PERHAPS
IT
WILL
HAVE
TO
WAIT
UNTIL
THE
NEXT
GENERATION
OF
CARDS
COMES
OUT
SINCE
THIS
CARD
CAME
BUNDLED
WITH
MY
SYSTEM
AND
ITS
NOT
SO
EASY
TO
EXCHANGE
THESE
THINGS
UNLESS
THEYRE
BROKEN
IF
YOU
WANT
THESE
MODES
STEER
AWAY
FROM
ORCHIDS
CARDS
IE
VLB
OR
VAVLB
AT
LEAST
UNTIL
THEIR
DEVELOPERS
ARE
LESS
BUSY
IF
THE
MAGAZINES
ARE
TO
BELIEVED
IVE
ONLY
SEEN
ONE
PRODUCT
THUS
FAR
WHICH
CAN
HANDLE
COLOR
GENOA
ALTHOUGH
EVENN
THAT
MIGHT
BE
A
MISPRINT
PLEASE
IF
THERE
ARE
GENERIC
OR
SEMIGENERIC
DRIVERS
OUT
THERE
LET
ME
KNOW
WHERE
I
CAN
GET
THEM
IS
OK
BUT
I
COULDA
GOTTEN
THAT
WITH
MY
ATI
VGA
WONDER
XL
