no
boot
disk
required
if
you
dont
want

load
date
apr
everybody
dos
users
in
particular
take
note
if
you
want
to
play
games
that
hateuse
their
own
upper
memory
manager
dos
is
not
a
problem
no
boot
disks
required
as
your
system
starts
up
hit
the
key
this
tells
it
to
bypass
config
and
autoexec
altogether
you
get
a
plain
generic
session
of
dos
with
nothing
loaded
theres
another
function
key
that
actually
steps
thru
configsys
asking
if
you
want
to
execute
each
line
but
ive
forgotten
it
at
the
momentyou
can
try
finding
it
i
think
its
no
you
need
not
bypass
the
configsys
in
dos
there
is
a
function
of
multiconfig
have
you
tried
bootsys
the
multiconfig
is
the
kind
that
you
can
choose
you
configsys
at
the
startup
and
i
find
that
is
very
good
it
has
no
conflict
to
qemm
i
have
problem
when
using
bootsys
the
key
you
say
is
which
is
trace
the
configsys
step
by
step
sorry
if
any
error
