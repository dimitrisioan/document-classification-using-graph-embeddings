DATASAVE
VIDEOSTREAMER
A
FEW
WEEKS
AGO
I
SAW
AN
AD
IN
THE
GERMAN
MAGAZINE
CT
ABOUT
A
SOCALLED
VIDEOSTREAMER
THIS
IS
AN
INTERFACE
BETWEEN
A
PCS
PARALLEL
PORT
AND
ANY
VIDEORECORDER
FOR
BACKING
UP
YOUR
DATA
ON
A
VIDEOTAPE
THE
COMPANY
DATASAVE
CLAIMS
THAT
IT
CAN
STORE
UP
TO
GB
ON
A
MINUTES
TAPE
IT
COSTS
DM
ABOUT
USD
I
THINK
MY
QUESTION
IS
DOES
ANYBODY
USE
THIS
PRODUCT
IF
YES
HOW
MANY
BYTES
REALLY
FIT
ON
A
MINUTES
TAPE
GB
SOUNDS
QUITE
UNBELIEVABLE
TO
ME
HOWEVER
ANY
COMMENTS
ON
THE
INTERFACE
ARE
APPRECIATED
PLEASE
MAIL
YOUR
REPLIES
DIRECTLY
TO
ME
I
WILL
SUM
UP
IF
NECCESARY
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
