mouse
port
with
high
interrupt

loran
n
yourk
writes
with
a
sound
card
on
interrupt
two
serial
ports
one
for
modem
on
one
for
miracle
piano
on
and
a
printer
port
on
i
have
run
out
of
low
interrupts
what
i
would
like
is
a
mouse
port
with
an
interrupt
of
or
which
ever
interrupt
the
mouse
port
uses
in
in
isa
computer
i
called
technical
support
of
microsoft
logitech
ati
checked
what
interrupts
the
mouse
port
on
the
ati
video
cards
can
use
and
they
all
said
the
only
interrupts
possible
on
these
cards
was
ones
lower
than
does
anyone
know
of
any
board
for
an
isa
bus
which
will
allow
a
mouse
port
or
even
a
serial
port
with
high
interrupts
try
putting
one
of
the
irqs
for
your
com
ports
onto
the
hardware
will
automagically
wrap
to
on
at
class
machines
eg
anything
with
high
irqs
this
is
what
im
doing
on
my
set
up
right
now
ive
got
on
really
address
it
this
way
in
software
on
soundblaster
on
on
and
my
ati
busmouse
port
on
one
of
the
interrupts
in
between
works
just
great
if
you
need
even
more
theres
a
text
file
floating
around
somewhere
that
details
how
to
hack
up
any
serial
card
and
probably
any
others
to
work
on
the
higher
irqs
it
basically
involves
cutting
the
trace
to
the
low
irq
and
running
a
wire
over
the
a
high
irq
pin
on
the
expansion
bus
it
will
be
best
to
put
the
modems
com
port
onto
this
will
be
the
first
irq
serviced
by
the
system
giving
the
modem
a
better
response
especially
handy
under
multitaskers
like
which
im
running
with
no
problems
