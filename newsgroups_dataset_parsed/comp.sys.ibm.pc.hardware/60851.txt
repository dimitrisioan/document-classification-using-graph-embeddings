what
are
peoples
opinions
on
the
above
make
of
hard
drives
i
seem
to
have
found
a
really
good
bargain
on
a
drive
but
i
thought
id
check
if
anyone
had
any
comments
to
say
on
this
make
also
im
a
bit
of
a
novice
with
pcs
but
an
experienced
computer
user
when
connecting
and
fitting
this
drive
into
one
of
my
spare
bays
what
extras
will
i
need
a
cable
for
starters
i
guess
but
what
about
brackets
etc
also
i
think
i
might
have
to
change
some
jumpers
on
the
drive
and
my
original
connar
one
ill
be
attaching
the
second
drive
to
a
seperate
ide
socket
on
my
controler
card
what
will
i
need
to
change
yet
again
many
thanks
to
all
that
have
answered
me
in
the
past
and
to
any
that
answer
me
in
the
future

own
imagination
and
skill
