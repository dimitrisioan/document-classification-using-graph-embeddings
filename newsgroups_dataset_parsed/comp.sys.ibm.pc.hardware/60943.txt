universal
arithmetic
receiver
transmitter
normally
the
older
boards
have
a
or
uart
on
board
those
chips
generate
an
irq
for
every
char
they
received
the
uart
has
an
internal
byte
buffer
so
with
the
right
software
installed
it
generates
an
irq
every
chars
close
universal
asynchronous
receiver
transmitter
is
it
necessary
for
or
higher
throughput
if
you
ran
dos
you
dont
need
a
because
dos
runs
only
one
task
at
a
time
and
the
whole
cpupower
could
be
used
for
the
transfer
even
if
you
are
running
dos
if
your
cpu
cant
handle
the
speed
of
the
interrupts
you
will
still
lose
characters
i
have
one
machine
with
an
external
bps
modem
attached
and
cant
drive
the
serial
port
any
faster
than
without
losing
characters
