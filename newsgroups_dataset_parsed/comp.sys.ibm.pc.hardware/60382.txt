my
fiance
has
a
pcjunior
and
wants
to
upgrade
to
a
full
does
anyone
know
if
we
could
use
the
monitor
it
came
with
on
a
new
machine
i
heard
its
mcga
or
ega
but
not
sure
which
also
does
it
use
cards
so
we
can
use
the
drive
controller
floppy
etc
the
only
things
youll
be
able
to
salvage
from
the
junior
are
the
floppy
drives
and
monitor
the
floppies
are
and
the
monitor
is
cga
but
you
will
need
an
adaptor
cable
to
use
it
the
junior
does
not
use
standard
cards
unless
youre
really
strapped
for
cash
you
should
just
junk
the
thing
and
buy
new
stuff
