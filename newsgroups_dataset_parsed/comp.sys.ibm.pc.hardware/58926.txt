JDIERSDANTENMSUEDU
DIERS
WRITES
I
OWN
A
STEALTH
CARD
FROM
DIAMOND
WHEN
USING
THE
WIN
DRIVER
THE
CARD
AND
DRIVER
WORK
BUT
ARE
NOT
VERY
FAST
ALL
OF
THE
OTHER
WINDOWS
DRIVERS
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
BUGS
SHADOWS
REMAIN
WHEN
WINDOWS
ARE
ERASED
AND
TEXT
BOXES
ARE
OFTEN
UNREADABLE
ALL
ATTEMPTS
TO
GET
HELP
FROM
DIAMOND
HAVE
FAILED
I
HAVE
CALLED
THE
TECH
SUPPORT
AND
NEVER
BEEN
ABLE
TO
GET
PAST
THE
HOLD
LINE
A
TOLL
CALL
IN
A
REASONABLE
TIME
IE
LEAVING
VOICE
MAIL
HAS
NOT
HELPED
EITHER
THE
BBS
IS
A
JOKE
IT
ALWAYS
HAS
TOO
MANY
PEOPLE
ON
TO
DOWNLOAD
ANYTHING
YOU
CANNOT
EVEN
GET
A
FILE
LISTING
IT
CONSIDERS
THAT
A
DOWNLOAD
I
HAVE
FAXED
THE
TECH
SUPPORT
GROUP
ALL
THIS
WITH
NO
REPONSE
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
IF
YOU
ARE
LOOKING
FOR
A
FAST
CARD
AND
WANT
TO
USE
IT
FOR
WINDOWS
DO
NOT
GET
A
DIAMOND
PRODUCT
TRY
ANOTHER
VENDOR
I
WISH
I
HAD
WHILE
OTHERS
HERE
MAY
HAVE
HAD
BETTER
EXPERIENCES
I
TOO
SHARE
THE
SENTIMENTS
POSTED
ABOVE
THOUGH
I
HAVE
THE
ORIGINAL
STEALTHVRAM
IT
IS
ONLY
RELATIVELY
RECENT
THAT
THE
WINDOWS
DRIVERS
FOR
THIS
CARD
HAVE
EVOLVED
TO
A
POINT
OF
DECENT
PERFORMANCE
NOTE
THAT
THERE
ARE
STILL
A
COUPLE
OF
MODES
I
CANNOT
USE
IE
WILL
NOT
DUE
TO
SHADOWING
MISDRAWN
CHECK
BOXES
ETC
I
BELIEVE
THE
VERSION
I
HAVE
IS
IF
THERES
A
MORE
RECENT
RELEASE
ID
APPRECIATE
IF
SOMEONE
WOULD
DROP
ME
A
NOTE
TO
LET
ME
KNOW
I
HAVENT
BEEN
ABLE
TO
GET
ON
THEIR
BBS
LATELY
TO
CHECK
AGAIN
NATURALLY
DIAMOND
DOESNT
EVEN
BOTHER
NOTIFYING
ME
OF
FIXESRELEASES
DIAMOND
WAS
HELPFUL
WHEN
I
FINALLY
REACHED
THE
RIGHT
PERSON
IN
CURING
SOME
OF
MY
WINDOWS
PROBLEMS
DUE
TO
AN
ADDRESS
CONFLICT
THE
CONFLICTING
ADDRESSES
WERE
OMITTED
IN
AT
LEAST
MY
VERSION
OF
THE
DIAMONDVRAM
MANUAL
I
HOPE
IT
HAS
BEEN
CORRECTED
BY
NOW
THE
TECH
REP
EXPLAINED
THAT
ALL
BOARDS
USE
THESE
ADDRESSES
I
HAVE
NOT
CONFIRMED
THE
VALIDITY
OF
THAT
STATEMENT
WHEN
I
UPGRADE
MY
MOTHERBOARD
IN
THE
NEAR
FUTURE
HOPEFULLY
WITH
SOME
FORM
OF
