RE
MODEMS
AND
NOISY
LINES
I
USED
TO
HAVE
A
LOT
OF
LINE
NOISE
PROBLEMS
WITH
MY
BAUD
MODEM
WHAT
WAS
SUDGESTED
TO
ME
WAS
TO
PUT
A
TORIOD
TRANSFORMER
ON
THE
LINE
THIS
IS
EASILY
DONE
BY
GETTING
A
LARGE
TOROID
CORE
FROM
YOUR
LOCAL
ELECTRONICS
SHOP
A
TOROID
CORE
IS
A
CERAMICMETAL
DONUT
AND
WIND
THE
TELEPHONE
LINE
IN
THROUGH
THE
CENTER
OF
THE
CORE
AND
OUT
AROUND
THE
OUTSIDE
FIVE
OR
SIX
TIMES
THIS
IS
A
EASY
AND
CHEAP
FIX
THAT
DOES
NOT
HAVE
THE
HASSELS
OF
HAVING
TO
USE
SOFWARE
TO
FIX
A
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
