READONLY
HARDDRIVE
ON
A
FEW
COMPUTERS
WHICH
WE
HAVE
HERE
AT
SHERIDAN
COLLEGE
THERE
ARE
FILES
WHICH
WE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
MAKE
READ
ONLY
I
HAVE
USED
THE
DOS
ATTRIB
COMMAND
BUT
SOME
PEOPLE
WHO
CARRY
AROUND
THE
ATTRIB
PROGRAM
IN
THEIR
POCKETS
HAVE
STILL
BEEN
ABLE
TO
ERASE
SOME
OF
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
FILES
ARE
THERE
ANY
SOFTWARE
PACKAGES
WHICH
WOULD
MAKE
AN
ENTIRE
DRIVE
READONLY
AN
EXAMPLE
PARTITION
THE
DRIVE
INTO
TWO
PARTITIONS
AND
HAVE
THE
FIRST
DRIVE
CONTAIN
THE
IMPORTANT
FILES
WHICH
CAN
BE
ONLY
READ
AND
THE
SECOND
DRIVE
YOU
COULD
BOTH
READ
AND
WRITE
ANY
AND
ALL
ENQUIRIES
OR
HELP
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
