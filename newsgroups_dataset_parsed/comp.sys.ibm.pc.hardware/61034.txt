SCSI
OR
IDE
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
WHICH
WOULD
YOU
CHOOSE
AND
WHY
LIKE
LOTS
OF
PEOPLE
ID
REALLY
LIKE
TO
INCREASE
MY
DATA
TRANSFER
RATE
FROM
THE
HARD
DRIVE
RIGHT
NOW
I
HAVE
A
IDE
DRIVE
SEAGATE
AND
A
STANDARD
IDE
CONTROLLER
CARD
ON
MY
ISA
IM
CURRENTLY
THINKING
ABOUT
ADDING
ANOTHER
HD
IN
THE
TO
RANGE
AND
IM
THINKING
HARD
ABOUT
BUYING
A
SCSI
DRIVE
SCSI
FOR
THE
FUTURE
BENEFIT
I
BELIEVE
IM
GETTING
SOMETHING
LIKE
TRANSFER
RIGHT
NOW
ACCORDING
TO
NU
HOW
WOULD
THIS
NUMBER
COMPARE
IF
I
BOUGHT
THE
STATEOFTHEART
SCSI
CARD
FOR
MY
ISA
PC
AND
THE
STATEOFTHEART
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
THE
BEST
SYSTEM
I
COULD
HOPE
FOR
OBVIOUSLY
MONEY
FACTORS
INTO
THIS
CHOICE
AS
WELL
AS
ANY
OTHER
BUT
WHAT
WOULD
YOU
WANT
TO
USE
ON
YOUR
ISA
SYSTEM
AND
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
IT
COST
ALONG
THOSE
LINES
WHAT
KIND
OF
TRANSFER
RATE
COULD
I
SEE
WITH
MY
IDE
HDS
IF
I
WERE
TO
BUY
THE
TOPOFTHELINE
IDE
CACHING
CONTROLLER
FOR
MY
HD
AND
HOW
MUCH
WOULD
IT
COST
THANKS
FOR
ANY
COMMENTS
