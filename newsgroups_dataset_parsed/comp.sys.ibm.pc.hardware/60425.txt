a
program
that
checks
a
computer
for
its

its
going
to
be
run
everytime
a
computer
boots
up
to
our
campus
network

just
not
getting
all
the
info
i
want
it
to
yet
anyway
i
want
to
check
for
a
mouse
i
already
check
for
a
mouse
driver
using
the
code
in
microsofts
mouse
book
but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
the
driver
is
loaded
when
my
program
runs
or
that
they
ever
load
the
driver
since
i
am
interested
in
what
hardware
is
attached
to
the
machine
