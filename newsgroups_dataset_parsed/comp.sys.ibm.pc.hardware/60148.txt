a
hard
drive
with
xttype
controller
can
be
added
but
i
recommend
not
trying
a
full
height
hard
drive
as
i
have
run
into
trouble
with
the
supply
not
having
the
oomph
to
spool
up
those
big
heavy
platters
one
way
to
get
the
system
going
with
one
floppy
drive
and
one
hard
disk
on
a
watt
power
supply
is
to
first
disconnect
the
power
from
the
floppy
drive
than
turn
on
the
pc
you
will
notice
the
hard
drive
having
a
real
difficult
time
getting
up
to
speed
but
it
manages
when
booting
is
finished
plug
in
your
floppy
drive
now
it
will
work
ok
i
know
this
is
not
very
user
friendly
maybe
you
are
better
off
buying
a
with
watt
power
supply
or
something
like
that
