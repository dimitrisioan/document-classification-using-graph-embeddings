SERIAL
CABLES
THERE
ARE
ONLY
THREE
OUTPUT
SIGNALS
TD
DTR
AND
RTS
THERE
ARE
FIVE
INPUTS
SIGNALS

ARE
MANY

NULL
MODEM
REQUIREMTS
AS
DICTATED
BY
THE
SOFTWARE
THE
IBM
BIOS
REQUIRES
ASSERTS
DTR
AND
RTS
AND
THEN
WAITS
FOR
BOTH
DSR
AND
CTS
BEFORE
SENDING
WHEN
A
BIOS
RECIEVE
CALL
IS
MADE
IT
ASSERTS
DTR
AND
WAITS
FOR
DSR
TO
BECOME
TRUE
TIMES
OUT
AFTER
A
WHILE
AND
RETURNS
WITH
AN
ERROR
IF
DSR
NEVER
BECOMES
TRUE
IT
REQUIRES
CTS
TO
BE
TRUE
FOR
SENDING
AND
RECIEVING
MOST
COMMUNICATIONS
PACKAGES
BYPASS
THIS
AND
REPLACE
IT
WITH
THEIR
OWN
PROTOCOL
THE
KEY
IS
THAT
EACH
COMM
PACKAGE
COULD
VERY
WELL
HAVE
DIFFERENT
REQUIREMENTS
MY
FAVORITE
CABLE
WORKS
IN
MANY
CASES
SHORT
RTS
TO
CTS
AT
EACH
END
BUT
ALSO
RUN
RTS
THROUGH
TO
DCD
AT
THE
OPPOSITE
END
TD
RUNS
THROUGH
TO
RD
AND
DTR
RUNS
THROUGH
TO
DSR
FROM
BOTH
DTES
AND
OF
COURSE
SG
GOES
THROUGH
TO
SG
I
HAVE
NEVER
HAD
TROUBLE
WITH
THIS
NULL
MODEM
EVEN
THOUGH
I
HAVE
USED
IT
WITH
A
COMM
PACKAGE
THAT
WAS
EXPECTING
RTS
TO
GO
TO
CTS
INSTEAD
OF
DCD
THE
ADVANTAGE
OF
THIS
CABLE
IS
THAT
IT
ALSO
WORKS
WITH
THE
IBM
BIOS
