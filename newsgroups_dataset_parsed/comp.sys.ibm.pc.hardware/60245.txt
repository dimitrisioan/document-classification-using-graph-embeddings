I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
THE
NETWISDOM
AND
NETOPINIONS
ON
IDE
CONTROLLERS
I
WOULD
LIEK
TO
GET
A
IDE
CONTROLLER
CARD
FOR
MY
VLB
MOTHERBOARD
WHAT
ARE
GOOD
OPTIONS
FOR
THIS
PREFERABLY

I
HAVE
A
MAXTOR
ON
AN
ISA
IDE
CONTROLLER
ALTHOUGH
MY
MACHINE
IS
VLB
I
HAS
THE
SAVE
TRANSFER
RATE
OF
MBS
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
VARIATIONS
OF
THE
ISA
BUS
SPEED
I
TESTED
IT
WITH
SPEED
BETWEEN
AND
NOT
ANY
DIFFERENCE
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
THE
INTERFACE
BETWEEN
THE
CONTROLLER
AND
THE
MEMORY
MY
ADVICE
BUY

ENJOY
