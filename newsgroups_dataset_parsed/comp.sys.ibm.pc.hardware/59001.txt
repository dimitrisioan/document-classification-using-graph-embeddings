WRITES
PLEASE
REPLY
VIA
EMAIL
SINCE
THIS
IS
JOB
RELATED
I
HAVE
A
COLORADO
JUMBO
BACKUP
SYSTEM
AT
ONE
OF
MY
PLACES
OF
EMPLOYMENT
AND
IT
HAS
EATEN
TWO
TAPES
BY
WINDING
THE
TAPE
OFF
THE
SPOOL
IS
THERE
AN
EASY
FIX
OR
IS
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
FRIED
DOES
IT
SIMPLY
NEED
CLEANING
ANY
AND
ALL
COMMENTS
WILL
BE
APPRECIATED

STEPHEN

HUSAK
UNIVERISITY
OF
ILLINOIS
DOES
IT
DO
IT
TO
ALL
TAPES
WERE
THE
TWO
TAPES
THAT
IT
UNWOUND
OF
THE
SAME
TYPE
FROM
THE
SAME
BATCH
THE
REASON
I
ASK
IS
THAT
I
BOUGHT
SOME
GENERIC
TAPES
THAT
DID
THIS
AND
FOUND
THAT
THE
TAPE
MARKERS
WERE
NOT
FULLY
PUNCHED
OUT
AND
HAD
CLOSED
THE
LITTLE
MARKER
HOLE
IT
WAS
ONLY
ON
A
FEW
TAPES
OF
A
SET
DID
YOU
OPEN
UP
THE
TAPE
CARTRIDGE
AND
PUT
THE
TAPE
BACK
ON
THE
REELS
IF
YOU
HAVE
NOT
YET
OPEN
IT
UP
BY
REMOVING
THE
TWO
SCREWS
ON
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
TAPE
CARTRIDGE
AND
SNAP
THE
PLASTIC
SHELL
AWAY
FROM
THE
METAL
BASE
AS
YOU
ARE
PULLING
THE
TAPE
THROUGH
THE
ASSEMBLY
TRY
NOT
TO
TOUCH
ANY
MORE
THAN
YOU
HAVE
TO
AS
YOU
ARE
DOING
IT
LOOK
FOR
A
COUPLE
OF
LITTLE
HOLES
IN
THE
TAPE
THESE
ARE
THE
MARKER
HOLES
WHICH
LET
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
KNOW
WHEN
IT
IS
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TAPE
THE
HOLES
ARE
SPACED
A
COUPLE
OF
INCHES
APART
MY
BEST
GUESS
IS
THAT
THE
DRIVE
FINDS
THE
FIRST
MARKER
AND
THEN
STOPS
ON
THE
SECOND
MARKER
ANYHOW
IF
THE
TAPE
HAS
THE
HOLES
THEN
CHECK
TO
SEE
IF
THE
MIRROR
ON
THE
TAPE
IS
CLEAN
THE
FUNCTION
OF
THE
MIRROR
IS
TO
DETECT
THE
MARKER
HOLES
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
SHINES
A
LIGHT
AT
THE
MIRROR
AND
HAS
A
PICKUP
IN
THE
AREA
WHERE
THE
REFLECTION
WOULD
COME
OUT
WHEN
THE
HOLE
GOES
BY
THE
PICKUP
DETECTS
THE
LIGHT
THAT
WAS
ALLOWED
TO
PASS
AND
IT
KNOWS
WHEN
TO
STOP
IF
THE
MIRROR
IS
DIRTY
OR
OUT
OF
ALIGHMENT
UNLIKELY
SINCE
IT
IS
MADE
INTO
THE
CASE
YOU
MIGHT
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
DETECTING
THE
END
OF
THE
TAPE
IF
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
DOES
IT
ON
ALL
TAPES
AND
THE
TAPES
ALL
LOOK
GOOD
THEN
EITHER
THE
PICKUP
OR
THE
LED
OF
THE
SENSOR
SYSTEM
HAS
FAILED
OR
IS
DIRTY
IF
YOU
OPEN
THE
DRIVE
DOOR
YOU
WILL
SEE
THE
SENSOR
ASSEMBLY
TO
THE
LEFT
OF
THE
RW
HEAD
ASSEMBLY
IF
IT
LOOKS
CLEAN
AND
NOTHING
IS
IN
ITS
WAY
THEN
THE
DRIVE
MAY
NEED
TO
BE
SERVICED
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
LED
IS
BURNED
OUT
OR
THE
SENSOR
IS
OUT
IF
IT
IS
STILL
IN
WARRANTY
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
SEND
IT
BACK
TO
CMS
FOR
REPAIR
