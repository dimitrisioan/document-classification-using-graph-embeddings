AM
LOOKING
FOR
A

TO
ACCESS
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
AT
THE
IO
LEVEL
THAT
IS
LOWER
THAN
THE
BIOS
GIVEN
THE
PORT
ASSIGNMENTS

CONTROLLER
CHIPSPEC
SHEET
DO
I
NEED
INFO
ON
MY
FLOPPY
IS
A
AND
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
WRITE
CODE
THAT
WORKS
ON
DISKS
AS
WELL
ALSO
WITH
THE
METHOD
OF
ACCESS
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
ACTUALLY
READ
THE
INDIVIDUAL
BYTES
ON
THE
TRACK
AS
THEY
STREAM
INTO
THE
CONTROLLER
IM
AFRAID
THE
SECTOR
HANDLING
IS
DONE
PURELY
THROUGH
HARDWARE
IF

THE
OFF
CHANCE
I
CAN
GET
THIS
BASIC
ON
THE
ACCESS
ANYTHING

POINT
ME
IN
THE
RIGHT
DIRECTION

A
FILE
OUT

HAS
LOTS
OF

ON
VARIOUS
PC

IS
ALSO
A
DETAILED
DESCRIPTION
OF
ALL
FLOPPY
CONTROLLER
COMMANDS
I
THINK
HARD
DRIVE
CONTROLLER

ENTIRE

ALL
GAPS
SECTOR

SECTOR
SIZE
TO
SOMETHING
VERY
LARGE
LIKE
