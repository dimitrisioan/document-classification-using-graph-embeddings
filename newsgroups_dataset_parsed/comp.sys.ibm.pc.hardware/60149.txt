i
am
looking
for
a
way
to
access
the
floppy
drive
at
the
io
level
that
is
lower
than
the
bios
given
the
port
assignments
what
controller
chipspec
sheet
do
i
need
info
on
my
floppy
is
a
and
i
would
also
like
to
be
able
to
write
code
that
works
on
disks
as
well
also
with
the
method
of
access
is
it
possible
to
actually
read
the
individual
bytes
on
the
track
as
they
stream
into
the
controller
im
afraid
the
sector
handling
is
done
purely
through
hardware
if
on
the
off
chance
i
can
get
this
basic
on
the
access
anything
to
point
me
in
the
right
direction
would
help
a
lot
there
is
a
file
out
there
look
for
it
with
archie
that
is
called
which
has
lots
of
info
on
various
pc
things
amongst
which
is
also
a
detailed
description
of
all
floppy
controller
commands
i
think
hard
drive
controller
commands
are
not
there
it
is
possible
to
read
an
entire
track
including
all
gaps
sector
headers
etc
by
setting
sector
size
to
something
very
large
like
