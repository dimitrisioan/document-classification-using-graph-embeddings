i
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
has
had
the
same
problem
i
am
having
with
my
gateway
vlbus
system
with
ati
graphics
ultra
pro
lb
when
i
have
my
computer
in
any
resolution
other
than
everything
is
fine
but
whenever
i
use
it
in
windows
autocad
gifs
the
screen
gets
about
inches
shorter
at
the
very
top
and
very
bottom
of
the
screen
there
is
about
a
bar
of
black
the
screen
isnt
cut
off
it
just
squeezes
everything
into
the
smaller
space
and
messes
up
the
aspect
ratio
while
i
can
manually
change
the
vsize
on
the
back
this
is
a
pain
in
the
ass
and
it
just
shouldnt
happen
anyway
ive
called
gateway
numerous
times
and
they
havent
been
able
to
help
me
at
all
two
different
times
they
sent
me
a
new
card
and
both
times
the
new
card
didnt
work
at
all
in
my
computer
they
even
tried
to
bill
me
for
the
first
card
because
they
didnt
get
it
back
in
a
couple
of
days
when
they
told
me
over
the
phone
that
they
would
wait
more
than
weeks
before
billing
my
card
but
their
customer
support
is
a
different
story
so
if
anyone
has
had
this
same
problem
please
let
me
know
if
you
know
what
to
do
hell
let
me
know
if
you
dont
have
a
solution
just
so
i
know
im
not
the
only
one
with
this
problem
thanks
in
advance

greer
ps
i
already
tried
going
into
the
mach
install
program
and
manually
set
ting
up
the
card
doesnt
work
whenever
i
try
to
increase
the
vertical
size
of
the
screen
it
just
starts
to
cut
off
the
top
and
bottom
maybe
its
a
monitor
problem
you
mentioned
that
you
swapped
cards
but
not
monitors
perhaps
that
could
be
it
