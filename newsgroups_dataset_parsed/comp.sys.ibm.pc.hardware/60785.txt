this
may
be
a
very
naive
question
but
is
there
any
basis
for
the
claim
that
a
cpu
will
get
hotter
when
a
computationally
intensive
job
is
running
my
friend
claims
that
there
will
be
little
difference
in
the
temperature
of
an
idle
cpu
and
a
cpu
running
a
computationally
intensive
job
it
first
depends
on
what
an
idle
cpu
is
doing
im
not
sure
about
dos
but
many
multitasking
oss
have
an
loop
like
this
loop
is
there
anything
to
do
yes
do
it
goto
loop
no
goto
loop
the
cpu
is
not
doing
any
work
but
it
is
still
processing
instructions
it
will
also
respond
to
interupts
