A
VERY

THERE
ANY
BASIS
FOR
THE
CLAIM
THAT
A
CPU
WILL
GET
HOTTER
WHEN
A
COMPUTATIONALLY
INTENSIVE
JOB
IS
RUNNING
MY
FRIEND
CLAIMS
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
DIFFERENCE
IN

INTENSIVE
JOB
IT
FIRST
DEPENDS
ON

AN
IDLE
CPU
IS
DOING
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
DOS
BUT
MANY
MULTITASKING
OSS
HAVE
AN
LOOP
LIKE
THIS
LOOP
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
