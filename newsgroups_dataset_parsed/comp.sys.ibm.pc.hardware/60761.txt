NUMBERS
THE
BYTE
ETHERNET
ID
IS
THE
UNIQUE
ELECTRONIC
SERIAL
NUMBER
ESN
ASSIGNED
TO
EACH
ETHERNET
BOARD
IN
EXISTENCE
THIS
IS
A
PHYSICAL
LAYER
CONCEPT
THE
IP
ADDRESS
IS
A

THE
ANALOGY
TO
TELEPHONE
SERVICE
IS
THE

IS
YOUR

MEANT
THE

HARDLY
BE
A
REASON

DO
THAT
IF
YOUR

IS
ACTUALLY
REFERRING
TO

IT
IS
MOST
DEFINETLY
CHANGABLE
BUT
IT
IS
STRICTLY
