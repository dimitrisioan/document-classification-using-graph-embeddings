HI
NETTERS
AS
PROMISED
HERE
ARE
THE
SUMMARY
OF
OPINIONS
ON
DOUBLEDISK
GOLD
PEOPLE
SEEM
TO
BE
QUITE
HAPPY
WITH
THE
PRODUCT
THERE
IS
NO
MUCH
OF
OPINION
ON
HOW
GOOD
IT
IS
COMPARED
TO
THE
INDUSTRY
LEADER
STACKER
SUPERSTOR
PRO
IS
NOT
CONSIDERED
SINCE
IT
IS
SLOWER
THAN
STACKER
ALTHOUGH
JUST
AS
RELIABLE
BYTE
MAGAZINES
CONCLUSION
SO
ITS
HARD
TO
MAKE
ANY
DECISION
TO
GO
WITH
STACKER
OR
WITH
DOUBLEDISK
GOLD
HOWEVER
IT
SEEMS
THAT
AT
IT
IS
QUITE
A
BUY

SUMMARY
OF
REPLIES
HELLO
BUDDY
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
DD
GOLD
EXPERIENCE
I
JUST
ORDERED
IT
I
CURRENTLY
HAVE
DD
THE
LAST
VERSION
I
AM
VERY
PLEASED
WITH
ITS
PERFORMANCE
HERE
IS
MY
SUGGESTION
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
COMPRESSION
SOFTWARE
CURRENTLY
I
WOULD
GO
WITH
DOS
COMPRESSION
ALL
THE
DISCUSSION
ON
THE
NET
INDICATES
THAT
FOR
YOU
GET
THE
COMPRESSION
BUILT
INTO
THE
OS
PLUS
THE
OTHER
UTILITIES
THAT
YOU
WOULD
PAY
WAY
MORE
THAN
FOR
BESIDES
YOU
ARE
NOW
AT
WHATEVER
THAT
MEANS
IF
YOU
HAVE
DOUBLEDISK
ALREADY
LIKE
I
DO
THE
COST
IS
FOR
THE
UPGRADE
AFTER
THINKING
ABOUT
IT
AND
ASKING
THE
NET
I
DECIDED
THAT
I
COULD
NOT
GO
WRONG
WITH
THE
UPDATE
COST
I
HAVE
NEVER
SUFFERED
FROM
PERFORMANCE
OF
DD
I
HAVE
A
HD
WITH
LARGE
SW
PACKAGES
IN
BOTH
COMPRESSED
AND
UNCOMPRESSED
FORMAT
IT
WORKS
GREAT
NOT
DELAYS
I
THINK
THE
A
IS
BETTER
THAN
B
ARGUEMENTS
ARE
A
LOT
OF
BUNK
THEY
ARE
ALL
COMPARABLE
IN
PERFORMANCE
I
AM
LOOKING
FORWARD
TO
BEING
ABLE
TO
LOADHIGH
THE
DD
SW
THAT
HAS
BEEN
AN
ANNOYANCE
IF
YOU
HAVE
STACKER
ETAL
CURRENTLY
I
WOULD
NOT
SEE
IT
WORTH
THE
EFFORT
TO
UPGRADE
JUST
MY
REGARDS
MARK
BAGDY
BUDDY
I
GOT
THE
SAME
MAILER
ABOUT
WEEKS
AGO
I
GOT
DDG
AND
INSTALLED
IT
THE
DOCUMENTATION
WAS
IN
MY
OPINION
EASY
TO
FOLLOW
I
USED
THE
AUTOMATIC
INSTALLATION
NOT
THE
CUSTOM
AND
EVERYTHING
WENT
SMOOTHLY
THERE
WERE
SOME
SPECIFIC
INSTRUCTIONS
ON
A
README
FILE
FOR
DEALING
WITH
QEMM
DDG
HAS
AN
UNINSTALL
UNLIKE
IF
YOU
NEED
IT
MY
SYSTEM
HAS
A
HARD
DRIVE
BEFORE
INSTALLING
DDG
I
HAD
FREE
AFTER
DDG
I
HAD
FREE
PRETTY
GOOD
STATISTICS
CONSIDERING
THAT
MY
PERMANENT
WINDOWS
SWAP
FILE
STAYED
ON
THE
UNCOMPRESSED
PORTION
ALONG
WITH
OTHER
DRIVERS
AND
SUCH
I
HAVE
HAD
NO
PROBLEMS
WHATSOEVER
I
HAVE
NOTICED
NO
SLOWDOWN
OTHER
THAN
IT
TAKES
A
LITTLE
LONGER
TO
BOOT
EITHER
IN
WINDOWS
OR
DOS
SO
FAR
I
AM
A
VERY
HAPPY

MY
MAIL
MY
OPINIONS
I
HAVE
BEEN
USING
DOUBLEDISK
GOLD
FOR
A
LITTLE
MORE
THAN
A
MONTH
ON
A
SEAGATE
DRIVE
RUNNING
DOS
WINDOWS
IN
ENHANCED
MODE
I
RAN
SOME
TESTS
AND
CONCLUDED
THAT
THE
SPEED
OF
A
DOUBLEDISK
DRIVE
WITH
A
DRIVE
READ
CACHE
IS
ABOUT
EQUAL
TO
THE
BARE
DRIVE
WITHOUT
A
CACHE
I
HAVE
NO
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
RELIABILITY
IT
WAS
VERY
EASY
TO
INSTALL
THE
ONLY
PROBLEM
I
HAD
WAS
WITH
CASTLE
WOLFENSTEIN
I
ASSUMED
THE
GAME
WAS
TRYING
TO
BYPASS
DOS
DISK
ACCESS
AND
MOVED
THE
GAME
TO
THE
NONCOMPRESSED
REGION
OF
THE
DISK
SINCE
THEN
THE
GAME
HAS
NEVER
GIVEN
ME
A
PROBLEM
THERE
WAS
NEVER
ANY
DAMAGE
TO
THE
DOUBLEDISK
DRIVE
COMPRESSION
PERFORMANCE
FOR
THE
WHOLE
DISK
HAS
HELD
STEADY
AROUND
THIS
IS
LOWER
THAN
EXPECTED
BUT
ABOUT
SIZE
OF
MY
FILES
ARE
COMPRESSED
IMAGE
FILES
AND
SOME
LARGE
ZIP
FILES
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
MORE
SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS
LET
ME
KNOW
DAN
I
BOUGHT
IT
AN
HAVE
BEEN
HAPPY
WITH
IT
I
USE
IT
ON
BOTH
MFM
AND
IDE
MB
DRIVES
I
WAS
USING
DOUBLEDISK
BEFORE
GOLD
CAME
OUT
THAT
IS
THE
SAME
PRODUCT
MSDOS
IS
SHIPPING
WITH
NO
PROBLEMS
WITH
EITHER
PRODUCT
