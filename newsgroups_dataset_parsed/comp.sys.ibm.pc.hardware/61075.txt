what
is
the
difference
between
the
us
robotics
courier
external
and
t
sportster
external
i
see
that
the
price
of
a
sportster
has
dramatical
dropped
to
below
but
the
price
of
the
courier
remains
above
anyone
with
knowledge
of
both
of
these
modems
or
anyone
that
owns
a
courier
the
sportster
at
has
error
control
and
bis
data
compression
this
is
becoming
standard
on
all
these
high
speed
modems
the
difference
with
the
courier
is
that
it
can
run
at
and
only
in
the
hst
mode
the
courrier
will
not
run
at
only
the
dual
standard
hst
the
usr
modem
over
my
courrier
will
do
up
to
and
with
compression
error
correction
much
more
it
will
do
etc
etc
and
asl
too
whatever
asl
is
