I
HAVE
A
FLOPPY
DRIVE
WHICH
HAS
DEVELOPED
GENERAL
FAILURE
ERRORS
ITS
A
TEAC
DRIVE
I
TOOK
IT
OUT
OF
THE
MACHINE
AND
NOTICED
IT
WAS
VERY
DUSTY
I
USED
A
HIGH
POWERED
AIR
CAN
TO
BLOW
ALL
THIS
DUST
OUT
AND
ITS
QUITE
CLEAN
NOW
HOWEVER
IT
DIDNT
HELP
THE
PROBLEM
IVE
ALSO
IDENTIFIED
THAT
WHEN
THE
MACHINE
BOOTS
AND
THE
DRIVE
SEEKS
FOR
A
BOOT
DISK
THE
HEAD
MOVEMENT
DURING
THIS
PROCESS
IS
NOW
APPROXIMATELY
HALF
THE
LENGTH
OF
THE
ORIGINAL
TIME
WHAT
I
MEAN
IS
THE
PERIOD
WHEN
THE
DRIVE
LIGHT
COMES
ON
AND
THE
HEADS
MOVE
FROM
THEIR
RETRACTED
POSITION
OUT
TO
THE
TRACK
CONTAINING
THE
BOOT
SECTOR
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
MORE
I
CAN
DO
TO
TRY
AND
SAVE
THIS
DRIVE
ID
PREFER
NOT
TO
SHELL
OUT
FOR
A
NEW
ONE
IF
I
CAN
HELP
IT
