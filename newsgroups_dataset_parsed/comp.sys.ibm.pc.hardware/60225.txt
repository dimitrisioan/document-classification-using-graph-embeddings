apple
hard
disk
drive
just
wanted
to
ask
a
question
i
bought
a
hard
disk
drive
secondhand
the
other
day
and
i
opened
the
packaging
up
and
saw
that
there
was
a
small
sticker
on
the
drive
that
had
a
little
red
apple
with
a
bite
taken
out
of
it
its
socket
did
not
look
the
same
as
my
existing
hard
disk
that
is
in
my
computer
already
it
has
fifty
little
pins
sticking
out
from
it
instead
of
the
that
is
sticking
out
of
my
old
hard
disk
i
dont
know
if
disk
drives
for
the
apple
or
mac

different
from
ones
used
in
at

use
this
hard
disk
