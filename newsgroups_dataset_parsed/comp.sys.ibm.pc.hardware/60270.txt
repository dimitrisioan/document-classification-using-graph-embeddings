monitor
with
rgbsync
to
vga
i
dont
know
if
this
is
an
obvious
question
but
can
any
of
the
current
batch
of
windows
accelerator
cards
diamond
etc
be
used
to
drive
a
monitor
which
has
rgb
and
horizontal
and
vertical
sync
bnc
jacks
altogether
connectors
out
the
back
i
might
be
able
to
get
ahold
of
a
raster

cheap
and
i
was
wondering
if
it
was
possible
to
connect
it
via
an
adapter
rgb

vga
to
my
gateway
would
i
need
different
drivers
etc
