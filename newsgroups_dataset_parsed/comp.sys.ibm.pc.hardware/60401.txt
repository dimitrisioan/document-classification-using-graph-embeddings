I
SAW
THE
FOLLOWING
COMPUTER
IN
A
STORE
AND
WANTED
TO
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
COMPUTER
OR
DOES
SOMEONE
SEE
SOMETHING
WRONG
WITH
IT
I
ALSO
WOULD
LIKE
TO
SWITCH
THE
MOTHERBOARD
LATER
WHEN
THIS
COMPUTER
BECOMES
TOO
SLOW
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
POSSIBLE
WITH
A
LEADING
EDGE
COMPUTER
OR
WILL
IT
BE
DIFFICULT
TO
FIND
A
MOTHERBOARD
THAT
WILL
FIT
IN
THIS
COMPUTER
ANY
HELP
WILL
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
