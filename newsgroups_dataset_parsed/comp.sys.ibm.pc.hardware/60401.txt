i
saw
the
following
computer
in
a
store
and
wanted
to
know
if
this
is
a
good
computer
or
does
someone
see
something
wrong
with
it
i
also
would
like
to
switch
the
motherboard
later
when
this
computer
becomes
too
slow
does
anyone
know
if
this
is
possible
with
a
leading
edge
computer
or
will
it
be
difficult
to
find
a
motherboard
that
will
fit
in
this
computer
any
help
will
be
greatly
appreciated
