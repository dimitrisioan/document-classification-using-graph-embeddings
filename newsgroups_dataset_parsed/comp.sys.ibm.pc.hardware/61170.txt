I
HAVE
AN
INTERNAL
MODEM
THAT
I
CONFIGURE
AS
WITH
IRQ
BUT
WHEN
I
INSERT
THAT
CARD
INTO
MY
DOS
PC
IT
SHOWS
UP
AS
WITH
AND
ADDRESS
WHEN
I
GET
INTO
DEBUG
AND
DUMP
THE
DATA
AT
IT
SHOWS
THE
ADDRESS
AS
BELONGING
TO
EVEN
THOUGH
THE
MODEM
SHOULD
BE
AT
THIS
IS
A
COMMON
MISCONCEPTION
SHARED
MY
MANY
MANUFACTURERS
PROGRAMMERS
AND
USERS
ALIKE
FOR
EXAMPLE
IS
SIMPLY
THE
THIRD
EQUIPPED
COMM
PORT
NOT
NECESSARILY
THE
ONE
WITH
IO
ADDRESS
THE
BIOS
JUST
SEARCHES
SEQUENTIALLY
THROUGH
A
SET
OF
POTENTIAL

PORT
ADDRESSES
THE
FIRST
EQUIPPED

YOURE

YOU
CANT

YOU
HAVE

THE

WHATEVER
THAT

MERELY
REFLECTS
THE
ORDER
IN
WHICH
THE
BIOS
SEARCHES
THE
IO
ADDRESS
SPACE
IN
ITS
SEARCH
FOR
SERIAL

SO
WHAT
YOU
HAVE
IS
INDEED
AT
THE
NONSTANDARD

WERE
THIS

IN
THE

INSTEAD
PROGRAMS
WHICH
QUERY
THE

TO
DETERMINE
THE

OF

WOULD
NOT
FIND
IT
AS
THE

IN
THE

DATA
AREA
WHICH
CONTAINS
THIS
NUMBER
WOULD
INDICATE
THAT
THERE
ARE
BUT
COMM
PORTS
INSTALLED
FRANKLY
I
DONT
KNOW
OF
A

THAT
WOULD
ACTUALLY
