WRITES
WHEN
TWO
OR
MORE
DEVICES
IN
AN
ISA
BUS
PC
SHARE
AN
INTERRUPT
ITS
BECAUSE
THEYRE
IMPLEMENTED
BY
A
SINGLE
CARD
INTERESTING
WOULD
YOU
CARE
TO
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
THEN
HOW
MY
SOUNDBLASTER
PRO
CARD
AND
MY
PRINTER
CARD
ARE
SHARING
IRQ
SUCCESSFULLY
I
ASSURE
YOU
THAT
THEY
ARE
BOTH
SET
TO
IRQ
AND
THAT
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
MY
COMPUTER
IS
A
DTK
IBM
CLONE
PAUL
BARTHOLOMEW
YOU
CAN
CONFIGURE
DEVICES
FOR
THE
SAME
IRQ
AS
LONG
AS
YOU
DONT
USE
THEM
SIMULTANEOUSLY
UNDER
DOS
AT
LEAST
BOTH
AND
SB
JUST
SIT
THERE
UNTIL
YOU
TELL
THEM
TO
DO
SOMETHING
YOU
CANT
CONFIGURE
A
SOUNDBLASTER
FOR
IF
YOU
GOT
AN
ETHERNET
CARD
WHICH
HITS
THAT
IRQ
A
THOUSAND
TIMES
OR
SO
PER
SECOND
