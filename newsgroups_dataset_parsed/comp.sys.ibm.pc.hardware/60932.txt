delayedwritecaches
im
using
norton
cache
which
is
really
nice
but
horrible
incompatible
some
games
wont
work
it
my
streamer
software
wont
work
with
it
and
windows
doesnt
like
it
at
all
but
when
copying
or
deleting
lots
of
small
files
only
ncache
is
really
fast
you
see
to
write
a
file
the
fat
must
be
changed
but
to
write
files
the
fat
must
be
changed
only
once
is
there
any
cache
program
out
there
which
is
smart
enough
to
do
the
same
and
good
enough
to
run
with
all
my
applications
any
help
is
really
appreciated
