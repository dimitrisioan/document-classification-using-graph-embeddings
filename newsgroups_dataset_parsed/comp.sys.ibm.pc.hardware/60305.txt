GUY
DAWSON
WRITES
THE
PARTITIONS
TAKE
UP
DISK
SPACE
HAVING
OR
PARTITION
WILL
COST
SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN
MEG
OF
HARD
DISK
SPACE
IF
YOU
CAN
AFOORD
THIS
LUXURY
MORE
POWER
TO
YOU
ITS
YOUR
CHOICE
WHERE
DOES
ALL
THIS
DISK
SPACE
GO
THE
DOS
PARTITION
TABLE
IS
FIXED
LENGTH
AND
EVERY
HARD
DISK
CARRIES
ONE
WHAT
IS
USEING
THIS
LOST
IF
I
REMEMBER
RIGHT
THE
PARTITION
TABLE
IS
ALLOCATED
AN
ENTIRE
CYLINDER
TO
FIND
OUT
HOW
MUCH
IT
TAKES
UP
YOU
NEED
TO
CALCULATE
HEADS
SECTORS
ALSO
IF
YOU
CREATE
AN
EXTENDED
PARTITION
THERE
IS
A
SECOND
PARTITION
IN
THERE
FOR
THE
LOGICAL
DRIVES
I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
RESPONDENT
GUY
DAWSON
WAS
REFERING
TO
SOMETHING
MUCH
MORE
ELEMENTARY
EVERY
PARTITION
WHETHER
IT
IS
THE
ENTIRE
DISK
OR
NOT
HAS
TWO
FATS
AND
AN
INITIAL
DIRECTORY
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
SMALL
DISK
MEG
OR
LESS
I
WOULD
RECOMMEND
THAT
IT
REMAIN
A
SINGLE
PARTITION
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
SOME
OTHER
CONSIDERATION
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
LARGE
DISK
GREATER
THAN
MEG
MULTIPLE
PARTITIONS
CAN
MAKE
SENSE
