a
soundblater
sb
card
is
supposed
to
share
irq
with
parallel
printer
interface
and
in
general
this
scheme
works
well
however
sometimes
there
are
conflicts
it
seemed
to
depend
on
the
software
more
than
anything
else
origin
games
are
especially
bitchy
about
having
the
whole
interrupt
to
themselves
my
solution
was
to
switch
the
interrupt
to
irq
which
is
unreserved
in
contemporary
computers
using
irq
for
the
drives
went
out
with
the
xt
architechture
dont
put
the
sb
in
irq
if
you
have
an
xt
get
a
new
computer
instead
this
irq
has
been
completely
stable
for
me
and
i
use
my
sb
to
play
mods
and
wavs
under
linux
a
free
unx
for
or
better
pcarchitecture
machines
with
no
problems
as
well
as
games
under
dos
i
also
use
irq
but
there
is
one
disadvantage
some
games
assume
that
the
board
is
using
irq
and
have
no
way
to
adjust
this
setting
i
had
trouble
with
some
of
the
lucas
films
games
