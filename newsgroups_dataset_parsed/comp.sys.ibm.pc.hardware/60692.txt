wanted
your
opinions
on
the
insight
talon
or
multimedia
kits
for
those
of
you
who
might
be
familiar
with
insight
distribution
network
inc
and
their
multimedia
kits
im
seriously
considering
buying
the
insight
talon
mm
kit
which
is
bundled
with
the
cdrom
drive
with
access
time
dtr
multispin
multisession
photo
cd
capability
etc
and
with
the
sound
card
etc
if
you
are
familiar
with
insight
you
know
the
kit
i
mean
i
believe
the
drive
is
either
a
texel
or
an
nec
but
it
is
not
clear
to
me
which
one
is
actually
a
part
of
the
bundle
at
least
two
of
their
sales
people
couldnt
give
me
a
straight
answer
as
to
which
one
ah
yes
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
oem
other
questions
excuse
my
ignorance
but
is
texel
a
reputable
maker
in
the
cdrom
market
or
do
you
think
nec
is
the
better
drive
bottom
line
is
this
kit
worth
the
money
currently
for
the
and
for
the
alternatively
i
was
thinking
that
the
might
be
overkill
for
my
uses
however
i
do
want
full
multimedia
capabilities
photo
cd
stuff
educational
programs
for
my
kids
etc
and
considered
the
lowerend
kit
and
using
the
difference
around
to
get
something
else
useful
like
a
tape
backup
drive
unit
basically
i
would
just
like
to
hear
from
those
who
have
actually
used
these
kits
and
whatever
proscons
you
might
advise
preferably
directly
to
the
email
address
below
thanks
