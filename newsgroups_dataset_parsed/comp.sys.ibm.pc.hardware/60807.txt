has
anyone
successfully
put
both
scsi
and
ide
hard
drives
on
the
same
system
i
would
like
to
know
as
well
since
i
just
bought
a
seagate
ide
drive
and
want
to
add
it
to
my
computer
a
fouryearold
gateway
which
currently
has
an
seagate
scsi
drive
the
scsi
controller
is
such
that
the
docs
told
me
not
to
specify
it
in
the
cmos
setup
ie
both
hard
drive
settings
are
listed
as
not
installed
and
apparently
the
scsi
controller
works
its
wonders
i
wondering
if
this
is
a
problem
also
i
remember
how
when
i
helped
my
cousin
install
his
second
ide
drive
we
had
to
define
a
masterslave
relationship
for
them
do
i
need
to
do
something
similar
here
i
am
particularly
interested
in
having
the
scsi
as
the
boot
drive
same
here
any
help
would
be
appreciated
since
i
intend
to
install
this
drive
asap
id
like
to
know
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
before
i
start
thanks
i
have
been
using
both
ide
or
mfm
and
scsi
drives
for
years
i
have
ide
and
scsi
on
one
system
and
the
other
with
ide
scsi
disk
and
scsi
cdrom
i
currently
using
always
scsi
card
but
i
also
have
a
future
domain
a
western
digital
scsi
card
and
i
work
with
an
adaptic
before
as
i
recall
all
these
cards
can
support
boot
and
floppy
drive
however
to
use
with
other
controller
ide
mfm
the
boot
drive
has
to
be
the
ide
or
mfm
you
can
not
boot
from
the
scsi
if
you
have
other
controller
in
the
system
if
you
guys
only
have
drives
ide
scsi
just
set
up
the
ide
in
your
cmos
setup
make
sure
you
can
boot
from
it
then
set
up
the
scsi
controller
irq
dma
etc
set
the
scsi
drive
to
id
just
plug
and
play
for
all
the
cards
i
seen
so
far
only
if
you
have
more
than
drives
then
you
need
driver
for
the
third
drive
and
so
on
if
you
have
more
question
email
me
i
will
try
to
answer
it
good
luck
