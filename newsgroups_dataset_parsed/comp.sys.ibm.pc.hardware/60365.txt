turbomodem
complete
pc
question
im
trying
to
transfer
some
software
between
two
machines
and
im
having
real
trouble
my
own
intel
works
finei
just
talk
to
it
at
and
everything
comes
out
clear
this
other
modem
at
the
other
machine
is
a
turbomodem
from
the
complete
pc
the
machines
are
in
seperate
houses
so
a
direct
serial
link
is
impossible
and
copying
this
much
data
to
disk
is
a
paineasier
to
turn
the
machines
on
for
a
few
hours
and
go
see
a
movieno
this
is
not
pirated
software
i
am
having
no
end
of
trouble
trying
to
set
it
up
it
will
dial
and
connect
just
fineat
baud
but
if
i
try
to
set
the
comm
at
or
the
stupid
thing
connects
but
just
gives
garbage
it
connects
his
machine
a
has
a
uart
so
thats
not
the
problem
it
seems
to
me
that
the
stupid
thing
wants
to
talk
to
a
comm
program
at
even
though
it
will
take
dialing
instructions
at
and
respond
ok
etc
to
other
commands
i
dont
have
a
comm
program
that
can
do
precisely
i
looked
at
the
manual
but
it
was
unclear
all
i
know
is
i
didnt
have
this
trouble
with
the
intelit
came
ready
to
connect
this
way
do
i
need
to
initialize
it
any
way
in
particular
also
its
using
and
and
when
connecting
here
ie
at
since
our
tests
at
are
zip
so
far
but
it
doesnt
say
so
there
any
ideas
btw
i
tried
the
initialization
string
that
i
use
for
my
modem
but
it
just
gives
error
on
that
one
moscow
a
grandfather
who
taught
literature
in
an
orphanage
has
gone
on
trial
in
rostovonthedon
after
confessing
to
more
than
gruesome
sexual
murders
whose
victims
included
children
as
young
as
eight
events
in
modern
history
