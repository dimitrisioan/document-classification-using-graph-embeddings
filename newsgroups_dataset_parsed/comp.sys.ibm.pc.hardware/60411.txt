THE
USE
OF
THE
BIDIRECTIONAL
PRINTER

HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY
USED
ONE
ON
A
TOSHIBA
LAPTOP
BY
ENABLING
BIT
OF
PORT
AND
CONTROLLING
BIT
OF
PORT
FOR
THE
DIRECTION
OF
DATA
FLOW
IE
FOR
OUTPUT
FOR
INPUT
THE
SAME

NOT
WORK

HEARD

THIS
ALSO
DOES
NOT
WORK
FOR
A
PARALLEL

SUPER

CARDS
AND
HAVE
BEEN
RUNNING
A
TAPE

VIA
A
PARALLEL
TO
SCSI
CONVERTER

I
AM
PRETTY
SURE
THAT
THE
PRINTER
PORT
IS
BIDIRECTIONAL

GREATLY
APPREASIATED
