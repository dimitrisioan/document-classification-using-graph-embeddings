INFO
NEEDED
I
WAS
RECENTLY
LOANED
AN
OLDER
DEC
AT
WORK
AND
I
HAVE
THE
OPTION
OF
ADDING
AN
ADDITIONAL
WESTERN
DIGITAL
HARDDRIVE
TO
THE
MACHINE
THE
EXISTING
DRIVE
IS
CURRENTLY
A
WESTERN
DIGITAL
AS
WELL
AND
IS
WORKING
FINE
BUT
I
DO
NOT
HAVE
ANY
DOCUMENTATION
AVAILABLE
FOR
CONFIGURING
THE
MASTERSLAVE
RELATIONSHIP
NECESSARY
FOR
A
C
D
DRIVE
SETUP
THE
FIRST
DRIVE
IS
CURRENTLY
FORMATTED
TO
TANDY
DOS
BUT
I
AM
EVENTUALLY
GOING
TO
UPGRADE
BOTH
TO
MS
DOS
V
THE
DRIVES
THEMSELVES
ARE
BOTH
MODEL
NUMBER
CIRCA
THEY
ARE
CYL
HEAD
DRIVES
A
NOTE
TO
ADD
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
EXACT
CONFIGURATION
FOR
THESE
IN
MY
CURRENT
BIOS
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
WORK
AT
A
SETTING
CYL
HEAD
WRITEPRE
LANDING
ZONE
THERE
ARE
THREE
PAIRS
OF
JUMPER
PINS
ON
THE
BACK
THAT
I
PRESUME
ARE
FOR
SETTING
UP
THE
MASTERSLAVE
ORIGINALLY
THE
DRIVE
IN
THE
MACHINE
HAD
NONE
CURRENTLY
I
WAS
SUGGESTED
TO
TRY
THE
FAR
RIGHT
LOOKING
AT
THE
BACK
FOR
MASTER
AND
THE
MIDDLE
JUMPER
FOR
THE
SLAVE
WHEN
BOOTED
THE
REINITIALIZE
SEEMS
TO
PUKE
ACCESSING
THE
D
DRIVE
IT
DOES
FLICKER
ABOUT
THREE
TIMES
ON
THE
SECOND
DRIVE
BUT
THEN
GIVES
THE
ERROR
HOPEFULLY
THE
PROBLEM
IS
AS
SIMPLE
AS
THE
DRIVE
NOT
BEING
FORMATTED
BUT
NOT
BEING
A
PERSON
WHO
HAS
EVER
HAD
TO
ACTUAL
FORMAT
AND
UNFORMATTED
DRIVE
I
WOULD
NOT
EVEN
KNOW
HOW
TO
DO
THAT
ANY
AND
ALL
HELP
ON
THIS
IS
GREAT
FULLY
APPRECIATED
IF
NOT
A
NUMBER
FOR
WESTERN
DIGITAL
MIGHT
JUST
DO
