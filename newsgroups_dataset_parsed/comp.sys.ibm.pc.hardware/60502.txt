THIS
MAY
BE
THE
DUMBEST
QUESTION
OF
THE
YEAR
BUT
IS
THERE
A
WAY
TO
PIGGYBACK
OR
EXPAND
A
MOTHERBOARD
ALL
TO
GET
THE
USUAL
MY
CASE
HAS
SLOTS
FOR
AND
ID
LIKE
TO
GET
A
SCANNER
BUT
WITH
ALL
MY
OTHER
CARDS
IM
ALREADY
MAXD
OUT
IM
HOPING
THAT
A
SIMPLE
SOLUTION
EXISTS
EG
AN
ADAPTER
THAT
TURNS
IM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
WILL
WORK
BUT
HOW
ABOUT
USING
ONE
OF
THOSE
T
EXPANDERS
USED
IN
THE
LOWPROFILE
CASES
THEY
ALLOW
SLOTS
STAGGERED
ON
EITHER
SIDE
OF
THE
CARD
YOU
CAN
INSTALL
IT
IN
THE
LAST
SLOT
AND
THEN
PROBABLY
HAVE
OR
SIDEWAYS
SLOTS
THIS
IS
ACTUALLY
HOW
IT
IS
DONE
IN
THE
LOW
PROFILE
CASES
A
STANDARD
MOTHERBOARD
THE
T
CONNECTOR
IN
ONE
SLOT
AND
THE
EXPANSION
CARDS
PLUGGED
INTO
THE
T
I
GUESS
YOU
COULD
DO
THIS
AT
EACH
END
OF
THE
SLOTS
TO
ADD
EVEN
MORE
THE
T
CONNECTORS
ARE
SIMPLY
TRACKS
WITH
SLOTS
ON
THEM
NO
ELECTRONICS
ON
IT
THE
ONLY
DOWNSIDE
YOUR
CASE
WONT
CLOSE
BUT
FOR
A
HOMEBREW
SYSTEM
THAT
MAY
NOT
BE
A
PROBLEM
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
PERFORMANCE
THOUGH
ILL
LEAVE
THAT
DISCUSSION
TO
THE
ENGINEERS
