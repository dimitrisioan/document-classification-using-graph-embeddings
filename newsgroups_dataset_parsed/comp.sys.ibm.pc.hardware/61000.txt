i
would
like
a
monitor
that
can
handle
high
resolutions
like
ni
i
want
a
high
resolution
versital
monitor
this
monitor
need
not
be
large
if
it
meets
the
brief
requirements
as
outlined
above
ive
been
very
happy
with
a
on
suns
and
could
probably
cope
with
smaller
at
home
im
interested
if
anyone
has
more
details
on
high
quality
sony
and
hitatchi
monitors
since
they
seem
to
be
used
on
suns
fairly
often
and
look
pretty
good
to
me
at
least
i
havent
seem
them
brought
up
in
csiph
very
often
as
are
mag
and
viewsonic
give
the
new
viewsonic
a
good
look
i
have
seen
it
side
by
side
with
an
old
viewsonic
a
mag
a
nanao
not
the
trinitron
one
and
a
sony
oem
which
does
have
a
trinitron
tube
the
new
viewsonic
beat
all
of
them
easily
in
terms
of
picture
quality
and
i
think
it
is
far
superior
to
the
sun
that
i
am
staring
at
now
the
place
asks
for
it
i
would
have
bought
it
if
i
had
not
just
bought
a
nanao
a
week
earlier

what
tube
does
the
viewsonic
use

been
looking
a
a
philips
which
uses
a
sony
trinitron
tube
has
digital
controls
supports
up
to

has
dot
pitch

can
be
found
