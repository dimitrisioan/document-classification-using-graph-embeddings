just
poke
out
the
little
pins
in
the
connector
and
then
replace
them
in
the
correct
slots
is
this
reverisible
you
can
unpoke
as
easy
as
you
poke
yep
ive
done
this
too
the
trick
is
to
use
a
tiny
screwdriver
and
push
down
on
the
latch
of
each
pin
and
then
pull
it
out
of
the
connector
label
each
one
first
with
tape
so
you
dont
get
them
confused
after
youve
pulled
them
out
compare
the
pinout
tables
in
the
mitsumi
and
soundblaster
manuals
to
get
the
correct
orientation
