re
consumer
warning
midwest
micro
ohio
i
must
say
that
i
have
been
a
customer
of
midwest
micro
for
over
years
now
and
have
been
well
taken
care
of
on
each
purchase
i
have
had
many
friends
that
have
bought
that
same
modem
and
they
do
have
some
experience
with
setting
up
modems
so
there
have
been
no
problems
in
of
them
that
i
know
of
the
fact
that
your
time
to
valuable
for
you
to
spend
on
the
modem
is
where
you
went
wrong
why
you
say
because
i
must
tell
you
of
the
yes
i
say
ppi
modems
that
i
have
had
in
the
past
that
i
was
trying
to
use
on
my
bbs
they
all
were
junk
and
were
replace
times
each
to
ther
point
that
i
just
said
forget
it
and
i
wanted
my
money
back
ppis
teck
even
said
that
they
didnt
even
repair
them
that
they
just
strip
the
parts
that
are
good
and
junk
thr
rest
of
the
modem
i
think
it
was
more
your
fault
than
midwest

installed
a
virusit
