IM
NOT
SURE
THE
MODEM
WOULD
WORK
OK
IN
A
BASIC
SYSTEM
BUT
IT
CLEARLY
DOES
NOT
WORK
IN
A
MULTI
PORT
SYSTEM
LIKE
MINE
SINCE
MY
TIME
IS
WORTH
MORE
THAN
THE
AGGRAVATION
OR
THE
COST
OF
THE
MODEM
I
GAVE
IT
TO
A
LOCAL
CHARITABLE
ORGANIZATION
WITH
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
MY
PROBLEM
AND
ORDERED
A
PRACTICAL
PERIPHERALS
FROM
PC
CONNECTION
FOR
MORE
I
HAVE
A
SOLID
EXTERNAL
MODEM
BUILT
BY
A
COMPANY
I
KNOW
WILL
SUPPORT
THEIR
USERS
AND
SOLD
BY
A
COMPANY
BASED
ON
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
WILL
TREAT
ME
RIGHT
IF
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
I
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
BETTER
BUT
BUT
BUT
HOW
DOES
BUYING
AN
EXTERNAL
MODEM
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
OF
WANTING
MORE
THAN
SERIAL
DEVICES
AT
ONCE
AND
SINCE
THE
PC
ONLY
SUPPORTS
TWO
WHY
ARE
YOU
BLAMING
A
MODEM
VENDOR
FOR
THE

I
DONT
SEE

YOUR

COULD
HAVE
BEEN
