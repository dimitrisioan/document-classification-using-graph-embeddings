THIS
MAY
BE
A
VERY
NAIVE
QUESTION
BUT
IS
THERE
ANY
BASIS
FOR
THE
CLAIM
THAT
A
CPU
WILL
GET
HOTTER
WHEN
A
COMPUTATIONALLY
INTENSIVE
JOB
IS
RUNNING
MY
FRIEND
CLAIMS
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
AN
IDLE
CPU
AND
A
CPU
RUNNING
A
COMPUTATIONALLY
INTENSIVE
JOB
IT
FIRST
DEPENDS
ON
WHAT
AN
IDLE
CPU
IS
DOING
IM
NOT
SURE
ABOUT
DOS
BUT
MANY
MULTITASKING
OSS
HAVE
AN
LOOP
LIKE
THIS
LOOP
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
TO
DO
YES
DO
IT
GOTO
LOOP
NO
GOTO
LOOP
THE
CPU
IS
NOT
DOING
ANY
WORK
BUT
IT
IS
STILL
PROCESSING
INSTRUCTIONS
IVE
DONE
SOME
ASIC
AND
DIGITAL
DESIGN
BUT
NOT
ANY
CPU
DESIGN
IT
WOULD
SEEM
TO
ME
THAT
ON
A
THE
FPU
IS
NOT
BEING
USED
MOST
OF
THE
CACHE
IS
NOT
BEING
ACCESSED
THE
OFF

BUFFERSDRIVERS
ARE

THE
MULTIPLIER
ISNT
MULTIPLYING
THE

SHIFTERS

SHIFTING
MICROCODE

MICROCODING
ETC
THIS
MEANS
TRANSISTORS
ARENT
SWITCHING
WHICH
MEANS
LESS
POWER
DISSIPATED
IN
CMOS
WHICH
MEANS
LESS
HEAT
FROM
WHAT
I
UNDERSTAND
THE
PENTIUM
SHUTS
DOWN
THOSE
SECTIONS
OF
THE
CPU
WHICH
ARENT
BEING
USED
IN
ORDER
TO
CUT
