REVIEWED
A
NUMBER
OF
MONITORS
RECENTLY
AND
THEY
TOO
SAID
THAT
THE
NANAO
WAS
THE
BEST
MONITOR
TO
GET
IF
YOU
HAD
THE
MONEY
BUT
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
THE
MITSUBISHI
DIAMOND
PRO
IS
THE
NEXT
BEST
CHOICE
AND
THAT
IT
HAS
SUPERB
PICTURE
QUALITY
THIS
MONITOR
CAN
BE
HAD
FOR
AROUND
HAS
ANYONE
ACTUALLY
SEEN
ANY
OF
THESE
I
AM
ALSO
THINKING
OF
BUYING
A
MONITOR
AND
WAS
GOING
TO
CONSIDER
THE
MITSUBISHI
IF
I
REMEMBER
CORRECTLY
I
THINK
ITS
VIEWING
AREA
IS
MEASURED
DIAGONALLY
