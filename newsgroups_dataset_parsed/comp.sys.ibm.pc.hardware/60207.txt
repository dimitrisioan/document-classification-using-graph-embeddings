WITH
THE
CHANCES
ARE
THAT
YOUR

PROBABLY
BECAUSE

THIS
APPEARS
TO
BE
A

SOLUTION
YOU
ARE
VERY
LUCKY
WHETHER
YOUR
LUCK
WILL
HOLD
OUT
REMAINS
TO
BE
SEEN
IF
YOUR

MUCH
SLOWER
THAN
BEFORE
THIS
IS
ALMOST
DEFINITELY
CAUSED
BY
SMARTDRIVE
WITH
DOUBLEBUFFERING
ACCORDING
TO
THE
WINDOWS
DOCUMENTATION
AND
THE
MICROSOFT
TECHNICAL
NOTE
SMARTDRIVE
DOUBLE
BUFFERING
REQUIRED
WITH
YOU
MUST
USE
SMARTDRIVE
WITH
DOUBLEBUFFERING
ENABLED
WHILE
THIS
WORKS
IT
REALLY
SLOWS
DOWN
YOUR

I
ONCE
ESTIMATED
THAT
THIS
SLOWED
MY
PC
DOWN
BY
A
FACTOR
OF
FIVE
AS
I
CONSIDER
THIS
UNACCEPTABLE
I
LOOKED
FOR
OTHER
SOLUTIONS
UNFORTUNATELY
YOU
CANNOT
JUST
DISABLE
DOUBLEBUFFERING
IF
YOU
DO
WINDOWS
IN
ENHANCED
MODE
WILL
NOT
WORK
AND
YOU
MIGHT
EVEN
DESTROY
THE
CONTENTS
OF
YOUR
HARD
DISK
BY
TRYING
TO
RUN
WINDOWS
WHAT
YOU
CAN
DO
IS
ONE
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
USE
OTHER
DRIVERS
THAT
PROVIDE
DOUBLEBUFFERING
IT
IS
MY
OPINION
THAT
THE
UNBELIEVABLE
SLOWNESS
IN
SMARTDRIVE
IS
CAUSED
EITHER
BY
HORRIBLY
INEFFICIENT
DOUBLEBUFFERING
OR
BY
A
BUG
IN
SMARTDRIVE
USE
A
DRIVER
THAT
PROVIDES
VDS
SERVICES
VDS
STANDS
FOR
VIRTUAL
DMA
SERVICES
THIS
IS
A
STANDARD
WHICH
IS
SUPPORTED
BY
WINDOWS
THAT
ALLOWS
BUSMASTERING
DISK
CONTROLLERS
LIKE
THE
TO
WORK
WITH
WINDOWS
AFTER
TRASHING
MY
HARD
DISK
COUNTLESS
TIMES
I
FOUND
THE
FOLLOWING
SOLUTIONS
NONE
OF
WHICH
REQUIRE
USING
SMARTDRIVE
NOTE
HOWEVER
THAT
I
AM
NOW
GETTING
OCCASIONAL
PARITY
ERRORS
WHICH
ARE
PROBABLY
NOT
CAUSED
BY
THESE
SOLUTIONS
BUT
MIGHT
BE
SEE
BELOW
WHILE
THE
FOLLOWING
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
SMARTDRIVE
USING
SOME
KIND
OF
DISK
CACHE
UTILITY
IS
STRONGLY
RECOMMENDED
AS
THIS
MAKES
WINDOWS
RUN
MUCH
MUCH
FASTER
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
THE

OR
YOU
DO
NOT
NEED
ASPI
FUNCTIONS
FOR
CONTROLLING
A
CDROM

YOU
CAN
ADD

THE

THIS

MUST

IT
CANNOT
BE
LOADED
INTO

AND
IT
OCCUPIES
ABOUT
AS
OF

THE

COULD
BE
OBTAINED
FROM

AT

ITS
STILL

YOU

AMAZINGLY
ENOUGH
THE
SCSIHASYS

CAN
ALSO
BE

ASSUMING
YOU
HAVE
DOS
I
WOULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
THAT
THIS
WOULD
CRASH
MY
SYSTEM
BUT
IT
DOESNT
I
ASKED
ADAPTECS
TECHNICAL
SUPPORT
ABOUT
THIS
AND
THEY
SAID
THAT
LOADING
SCSIHASYS
HIGH
SHOULD
BE
FINE
AS
LONG
AS
IS
LOADED
LOW
ON
MY
SYSTEM
NOT
USING
SCSIHASYS
WITH
WOULD
OCCASIONALLY
CAUSE
WINDOWS
TO
CRASH
UPON
RESTARTING
OR
EXITING
WINDOWS
WITH
THE
ADDITIONAL
RESULT
OF
A
CORRUPTED
DISK
SOME
OF
MY
CWINDOWSGRP
FILES
WOULD
BE
CORRUPTED
FOR
ME
THESE
CRASHES
USUALLY
OCCURRED
WHILE
MAKING
A
DIFFERENT
PROGRAM
FROM
PROGMANEXE
THE
DEFAULT
WINDOWS
SHELL
AND
VICEVERSA
THIS
IS
THE
REASON
SCSIHASYS
MAY
BE
NECESSARY
I
HAVE
ABSOLUTELY
NO
IDEA
IF
SCSIHASYS
IS
NECESSARY
WITH
VERSIONS
OF
EARLIER
THAN
NOTE
THAT
MANY
PEOPLE
CAN
USE
OR
WITHOUT
SCSIHASYS
THEY
DO
NOT
SEEM
TO
HAVE
ANY
PROBLEMS
AT
ALL
I
CONSIDER
THESE
PEOPLE
LUCKY
OTHERS
LIKE
ME
HAVE
HAD
ALL
SORTS
OF
PROBLEMS
IN
MY
OPINION
THE
BEST
BUT
NOT
NECESSARILY
THE
EASIEST
SOLUTION
IS
TO
UPGRADE
TO
THE
SCSIHASYS
DRIVER
IS
NO
LONGER
NEEDED
UNFORTUNATELY
WHILE
YOU
COULD
GET
PREVIOUS
UPGRADES
FROM
THE
ADAPTEC
BBS
THE
DRIVER
IS
NOT
AVAILABLE
FROM
THE
ADAPTEC

AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THERE
ARE
ONLY
THREE
WAYS
TO
GET
A

YOU

OF

ADAPTEC
EZ
SCSI
DRIVER
KIT
WHICH
SUPPOSEDLY
INCLUDES
AS
WELL
AS
OTHER
DRIVERS
SUCH
AS
CDROM
DRIVERS
I
BELIEVE
THE
LIST
PRICE
IS
AROUND
IF
YOU
ALREADY
HAVE
A
COPY
OF
AN
OLDER
VERSION
OF
YOU
CAN
SUPPOSEDLY
CONTACT
ADAPTEC
TO
UPGRADE
IT
TO
EZ
SCSI
FOR
AROUND
A
COPY

IN

TOOLS
FOR

NOTE
THAT
THE

ARE
STORED
IN

DIRECTORIES
NOTE
FURTHER
THAT
ONLY
IS
INCLUDED
THE
CDROM
DRIVERS
AND
DRIVERS
TO
SUPPORT
MORE
THAN
TWO
HARD
DISKS
ARE
NOT
INCLUDED
THIS
IS
WHERE
I
OBTAINED
MY
COPY
OF
NOTE
HOWEVER
THAT
I
AM
NOW
GETTING
OCCASIONAL
PARITY
ERRORS
WITH
WINDOWS
IN
ALL
PROBABILITY
DEFECTIVE
HARDWARE
IN
MY
PC
IS
CAUSING
THIS
AS
I
UPGRADED
MY
MOTHERBOARD
JUST
AFTER
I
FOUND
THE
ABOVE
SOLUTIONS
HOWEVER
BECAUSE
THESE
PARITY
ERRORS
OCCUR
ONLY
DURING
DISK
ACCESSES
THERE
IS
A
VERY
SMALL
BUT
DEFINITE
POSSIBILITY
THAT
THE
PARITY
ERRORS
ARE
DRIVERRELATED
FOR
EXAMPLE
CHANGING
THE
BUS
ONOFF
TIMING
FOR
CERTAIN
DISK
TRANSFERS
MIGHT
CAUSE
THIS
IVE
RUN
VARIOUS
MEMORY
TESTS
FOR
HOURS
AT
A
TIME
AND
THESE
TESTS
HAVE
FOUND
NO
PROBLEMS
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
PROBABLY
CAUSED
BY
MEMORY
WITH
MARGINAL
TIMING
REQUIREMENTS
WHICH
CAUSE
PARITY
ERRORS
DURING
DISK
TRANSFERS
THIS
IS
WHY
THE
MEMORY
TESTS
DIDNT
FIND
ANY
PROBLEMS
THE
PROBLEMS
SHOW
UP
ONLY
UNDER
DISK
IO
HOWEVER
IM
MENTIONING
THIS
JUST
IN
CASE
IT
ISNT
A
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
FLOPPYCONTROLLERBASED
TAPE
BACKUP
DEVICES
THERE
ARE
TWO
POSSIBLE
PROBLEMS
WITH
USING
THE
ADAPTEC
WITH
A
FLOPPYCONTROLLERBASED
TAPE
BACKUP
DEVICE
SUCH
AS
THE
COLORADO
MEMORY
SYSTEMS
JUMBO
TAPE
BACKUPSRESTORES
CAN
TAKE
A
VERY
LONG
TIME
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
CONSTANTLY
STARTS
STOPS
STARTS
STOPS
ETC
TAPE
OPERATIONS
MAY
BE
ERRATIC
OR
ENCOUNTER
TOO
MANY
TAPE
ERRORS
THIS
PROBLEM
MIGHT
BE
CAUSED
BY
DEFECTIVE
HARDWARE
ON
MY
HOWEVER
IVE
HEARD
OF
OTHER
PEOPLE
HAVING
SIMILAR
PROBLEMS
AND
SO
IM
MENTIONING
THIS
JUST
IN
CASE
IT
IS
NOT
A
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
ON
MY
TAPE
BACKUPSRESTORES
TAKE
A
LONG
TIME
IF
YOU
HAVE
A
FLOPPYCONTROLLERBASED
TAPE
BACKUP
DEVICE
YOU
MAY
HAVE
TO
ADJUST
THE
ADAPTEC
BUS
ONOFF
TIMING
FOR
BEST
RESULTS
WHEN
USING
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
NORMALLY
WHILE
DOING
A
TAPE
BACKUP
OR
RESTORE
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
MOTOR
SHOULD
BE
CONTINUOUSLY
RUNNING
WITH
ONLY
AN
OCCASIONAL
PAUSE
HOWEVER
THE
DEFAULT
BUS
TIMING
ON
THE
ADAPTEC
MAY
CAUSE
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
MOTOR
TO
START
AND
STOP
START
AND
STOP
EVERY
FEW
SECONDS
THIS
CAUSES
NEEDLESS
WEAR
TO
THE
TAPE
AND
TAPE
DRIVE
HOWEVER
NOTE
THAT
A
DIRTY
TAPE
HEAD
OR
A
DEFECTIVE
TAPE
DRIVE
CAN
ALSO
CAUSE
THIS
MAKE
SURE
YOUR
TAPE
HEADS
ARE
CLEAN
THIS
ALSO
CAUSES
THE
TAPE
BACKUP
OR
RESTORE
TO
TAKE
MUCH
MUCH
LONGER
THAN
NECESSARY
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
IS
THAT
THESE
TAPE
BACKUPS
USE
THE
FLOPPY
DMA
TO
TRANSFER
DATA
IN
MEMORY
TOFROM
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
AND
THE
ADAPTEC
USES
DMA
TO
TRANSFER
DATA
IN
MEMORY
TOFROM
THE
HARD
DISK
THE
FLOPPY
DMA
NEEDS
TO
FEED
DATA
TO
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
AT
A
CERTAIN
RATE
IF
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
IS
NOT
FED
DATA
QUICKLY
ENOUGH
BY
THE
FLOPPY
DMA
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
STOPS
REWINDS
A
BIT
AND
RESTARTS
ONCE
ENOUGH
DATA
IS
EVENTUALLY
FED
TO
IT
THE
DEFAULT
BUS
TIMING
ON
THE
ADAPTEC
WHICH
IS
REALLY
DMA
TIMING
IS
TOO
LARGE
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHEN
A
BACKUP
IS
DONE
DATA
HAS
TO
BE
TRANSFERRED
FROM
A
HARD
DISK
TO
MEMORY
AND
THEN
FROM
MEMORY
TO
THE
TAPE
BECAUSE
THE
DEFAULT
TIMING
ON
THE
ADAPTEC
HOGS
THE
MEMORY
TOO
MUCH
TOO
MUCH
TIME
IS
SPENT
TRANSFERRING
DATA
FROM
A
HARD
DISK
TO
MEMORY
NOT
ENOUGH
TIME
IS
SPENT
TRANSFERRING
DATA
FROM
MEMORY
TO
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
AS
A
RESULT
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
CONSTANTLY
STARTS
AND
STOPS
BECAUSE
DATA
IS
NOT
FED
TO
IT
QUICKLY
ENOUGH
THE
SOLUTION
IS
TO
CHANGE
THE
ADAPTECS
BUS
ONOFF
TIMING
THE
DEFAULT
FACTORY
SETTING
IS
MICROSECONDS
ON
AND
MICROSECONDS
OFF
THE
BUS
ON
TIMING
NEEDS
TO
BE
LOWERED
TO
MICROSECONDS
THIS
CAN
BE
DONE
IN
ONE
OF
TWO
WAYS
IF
YOU
HAVE
YOU
CAN
USE
THE
N
OPTION
FOR
EXAMPLE
I
USE
A
BUS
ON
TIMING
OF
MICROSECONDS
WHICH
MEANS
THAT
I
USE
THE
FOLLOWING
LINE
IN
MY
CONFIGSYS
FILE
NOTE
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
SPACE
BETWEEN
THE
N
AND
THE
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
YOUR
ONLY
RECOURSE
IS
TO
TRY
TO
FIND
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
SETSCSIEXE
WHICH
IS
VERY
DIFFICULT
TO
FIND
THE
REASON
IS
THAT
ADAPTEC
FOR
REASONS
OF
THEIR
OWN
DOES
NOT
SEEM
TO
WANT
THIS
WIDELY
DISTRIBUTED
I
ONCE
ASKED
SOMEONE
WHO
WORKED
FOR
ADAPTEC
AND
THEY
ASKED
ME
TO
NOT
UPLOAD
IT
ANYWHERE
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANONYMOUS
FTP
ACCESS
TO
THE
INTERNET
YOU
COULD
TRY
USING
ARCHIE
TO
HUNT
DOWN
A
COPY
I
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
ARE
A
COUPLE
OF
SITES
THAT
HAVE
IT
IF
YOU
DO
FIND
A
COPY
YOU
RUN
IT
LIKE
SO
SETSCSI
THIS
ADJUSTS
THE
BUS
ON
TIMING
TO
MICROSECONDS
RUNNING
SETSCSIEXE
WITHOUT
ANY
ARGUMENTS
RESETS
THE
BUS
TIMING
BACK
TO
THE
FACTORY
DEFAULTS
NOTE
THAT
IT
SEEMS
THAT
YOU
CANNOT
USE
SETSCSIEXE
IF
YOU
USE
SETSCSIEXE
CRASHED
MY
SYSTEM
IF
WAS
LOADED
I
COULD
USE
SETSCSIEXE
WITH
SCSIHASYS
HOWEVER
DO
NOT
LOWER
THE
BUS
ON
TIMING
BELOW
MICROSECONDS
OR
INCREASE
IT
ABOVE
MICROSECONDS
IF
YOU
LOWER
IT
TOO
LOW
THE
HARD
DISK
THROUGHPUT
WILL
SUDDENLY
DROP
YOUR
SYSTEM
WILL
FEEL
SLOWER
FOR
ME
MICROSECONDS
WORKS
FINE
THIS
VALUE
MAY
WORK
FINE
FOR
YOU
OR
YOU
MAY
HAVE
TO
ADJUST
IT
DOWNWARDS
A
LITTLE
ONCE
YOUVE
LOWERED
THE
BUS
ON
TIMING
TAPE
BACKUPS
AND
RESTORES
SHOULD
RUN
FASTER
ALSO
DO
NOT
EXPERIMENT
WITH
THE
BUS
ONOFF
TIMES
WITH
THE
OTHER
OPTIONS
THAT
I
HAVE
INTENTIONALLY
NOT
DESCRIBED
UNLESS
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
ARE
DOING
BAD
COMBINATIONS
CAN
CAUSE
PARITY
ERRORS
AND
WORSE
BY
STARVING
MEMORY
REFRESH
A
PROGRAM
CALLED
BUSTIFIXEXE
EXISTS
ON
THE
ADAPTEC
BBS
UNLESS
THIS
HAS
BEEN
UPGRADED
SINCE
I
LAST
CHECKED
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
A
WHILE
THIS
IS
A
SELFEXTRACTING
ARCHIVE
CONTAINING
A
BATCH
FILE
AND
A
COUPLE
OF
OTHER

THIS

WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
ALLOW
ONE
TO
SET
THE

ONOFF
TIMES
FOR
THE

OTHERS
HOWEVER
WHEN
I
TRIED
RUNNING
THIS
PROGRAM
WITH
MY
MY

CRASHED
AT
THE
TIME
I
WAS
RUNNING
SCSIHASYS
AND
I
DIDNT
CHECK
TO
SEE
IF
THERE
WAS
A
CONFLICT
WITH
IT
MAYBE
THIS

WORKS
ONLY
WITH
THE
ALTHOUGH
THE

SAY
THAT
IT
WORKS
WITH
THE
ERRATIC

INCREASED
DRAMATICALLY
AND
FASTBACK
PLUS
WAS
SUDDENLY
ABLE
TO
FIND
AND
USE
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
THIS
WAS
CAUSED
BY
A
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
ON
MY
ON
THE
ONE
HAND
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVES
WORKED
GREAT
WHEN
THEY
WERE
ATTACHED
TO
THE
WHICH
SEEMS
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
WAS
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
THE
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
DIDNT
WORK
WELL
ATTACHED
TO
THE
FLOPPY
CONTROLLER
BUT
IT
DID
WORK
WHEN
ATTACHED
TO
A
DIFFERENT
CONTROLLER
THIS
COULD
BE
AN
INDICATION
OF
A
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
ON
MY
I
DID
CHANGE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
CABLES
AND
SO
IT
IS
CONCEIVABLE
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
IN
THE
CABLES
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
THE
CAUSE
REALLY
IS
HOWEVER
IF
YOURE
HAVING
SIMILAR
PROBLEMS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
CONSIDER
TRYING
A
NEW
FLOPPY
CONTROLLER
SOUND
CARDS
MANY
POPULAR
SOUND
CARDS
CAN
PLAY
OR
RECORD
DIGITIZED
SOUND
AND
THIS
IS
TYPICALLY
DONE
USING
DMA
LIKE
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
DMA
THE
ADAPTECS
DMA
CAN
CONFLICT
WITH
THE
SOUND
CARD
DMA
UNLIKE
THAT
OF
THE
TAPE
DMA
THIS
CONFLICT
USUALLY
MANIFESTS
ITSELF
AS
A
PARITY
ERROR
YOUR
SYSTEM
CRASHES
WITH
A
PARITY
ERROR
MESSAGE
WHAT
HAPPENS
IS
THAT
DATA
IS
BEING
TRANSFERRED
SO
QUICKLY
BY
THE
SOUND
CARD
AND
THE
ADAPTEC
MEMORY
REFRESH
CANNOT
OCCUR
QUICKLY
ENOUGH
WHICH
CAUSES
A
PARITY
ERROR
USUALLY
GETTING
A
PARITY
ERROR
MEANS
THAT
THERE
IS
A
HARDWARE
PROBLEM
WITH
YOUR
SYSTEM
IN
THIS
CASE
HOWEVER
THE
PARITY
ERROR
IS
NOT
A
SYMPTOM
OF
BAD
HARDWARE
IVE
FOUND
THAT
SUCH
PARITY
ERRORS
TYPICALLY
OCCUR
WHILE
RECORDING
DIGITIZED
SOUND
AND
THE
CHANCES
OF
SUCH
ERRORS
INCREASE
AS
YOU
INCREASE
THE
RECORDING
FIDELITY
EG
HIGHER
SAMPLING
RATE
RECORDING
IN
STEREO
RECORDING
USING
INSTEAD
OF
ETC
LIKE
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
SOLUTION
THE
SOLUTION
HERE
IS
TO
LOWER
THE
ADAPTECS
BUS
ON
TIMING
SEE
THE
SECTION
ON
TAPE
DRIVES
FOR
INFORMATION
ON
HOW
THIS
IS
DONE
NOTE
HOWEVER
THAT
THIS
MAY
OR
MAY
NOT
SOLVE
THE
PROBLEM
IT
MAY
ONLY
REDUCE
THE
PROBABILITY
OF
A
PARITY
ERROR
THE
SOFTWARE
USED
TO
RECORD
DIGITIZED
SOUND
CAN
GREATLY
AFFECT
THIS
PROBLEM
IE
SOME
SOFTWARE
IS
INEFFICIENT
DISK
CACHES
THE
SPEED
OF
YOUR
HARD
DISK
AND
THE
AMOUNT
OF
DISK
FRAGMENTATION
CAN
