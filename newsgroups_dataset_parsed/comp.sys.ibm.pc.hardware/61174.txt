SPEAKING
OF
CPU
FANS
MANY
USE
CLIPS
MAKE
SURE
YOU
USE
HEAT
SINK
GREASE
OR
HEAT
TRANSFERING
TAPE
OR
YOU
WILL
HAVE
WASTED
YOUR
MONEY
DO
THESE
CPU
FANS
ALSO
HAVE
HEAT
SINKS
DO
YOU
RECOMMEND
USING
BOTH
ON
THE
SAME
CHIP
IE
HEAT
SINK
SANDWICHED
BETWEEN
CPU
AND
FAN
IF
WE
ARE
JUST
TALKING
ABOUT
A
CPU
FAN
BLOWING
DIRECTLY
ON
THE
CPU
CHIP
I
CANT
SEE
HOW
HEAT
SINK
GREASE
IS
NECESSARY
OR
EVEN
DESIREABLE

I
HAVE
A
PC
POWER
AND
COOLING
FAN
AND
IT
IS
A
HEAT
SINK
WITH
A
BUILT
IN
FAN
THAT
GLUES
ON
TOP
OF
THE
CPU
EVEN
IF
THE
FAN
QUITS
YOU
STILL
HAVE
THE
HEAT
SINK
FINS
TO
AID
COOLING
THE
GLUE
OF
COURSE
IS
THE
TYPE
THAT
HAS
HIGH
THERMAL
CONDUCTIVITY
