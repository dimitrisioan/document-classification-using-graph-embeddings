hi
does
anyone
have
a
source
for
motherboards
ive
been
calling
around
the
local
stores
and
everyone
appears
to
be
only
stocking
the
or
motherboards
how
difficult
is
it
to
modify
a
motherboard
to
run
at
mhz
is
it
as
simple
as
replacing
the
system
clock
with
a
slower
part
thanks
peter
this
is
normally
the
case
but
make
sure
you
get
a
board
with
a
plug
in
oscillator
as
you
will
screw
up
your
warranty
if
you
start
to
solder
the
board
