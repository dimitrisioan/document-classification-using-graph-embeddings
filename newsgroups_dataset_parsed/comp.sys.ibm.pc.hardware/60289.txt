ADAPTEC
AND
SONY
ABOUT
TWO
MONTHS
AGO
I
PURCHASED
THE
ADAPTEC
DRIVER
FOR
USE
WITH
A
CDROM
DRIVE
AT
THE
TIME
THIS
SEEMED
THE
THING
TO
DO
AS
THE
DOCUMENTATION
I
HAD
WITH
MY
ADAPTEC
SCSI
CONTROLLER
SAID
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
DRIVER
TO
BE
USED
WITH
CDROM
DRIVES
SINCE
THEN
I
HAVE
LEARN
THAT
THIS
DRIVER
IS
OUT
OF
DATE
IN
A
MAJOR
WAY
AND
THAT
ADAPTEC
HAVE
AN
UPGRADE
DEAL
FOR
GOING
TO
THE
NEXT
DRIVER
I
THINK
ITS
CALLED
EZISCSI
OR
SOMETHING
I
WASNT
TOO
FUSSED
ABOUT
THIS
UNTIL
I
UPGRADED
BY
CDROM
DRIVE
FROM
A
SONY
TO
A
SONY
I
NOW
FIND
THAT
THE
AUDIOMODE
WILL
NOT
WORK
I
ASSUME
IT
IS
NOT
BEING
HANDLED
CORRECTLY
BY
THE
DRIVER
SO
SHOULD
I
CHASE
ADAPTEC
FOR
AN
UPGRADE
IF
SO
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
THEIR
FAX
NUMBER
ANY
ASSISTANCE
APPRECIATED
REGARDS
BTW
EVERYTHING
ELSE
WORKS
FINE
CERTAINLY
SEEMS
THAT
SONY
HAVE
CAUGHT
UP
WITH
THE
REST
