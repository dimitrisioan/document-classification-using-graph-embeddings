an
simulator
is
example
code
available
hello
world
im
attempting
to
write
an
simulator
on
an
ibm
pc
for
teaching
purposes
so
that
firstyear
eleceng
students
can
see
the
workings
of
the
microcontroller
as
it
performs
operations
logical
ands
for
example
being
shown
on
a
bitbybit
basis
and
so
that
the
students
can
see
that
its
not
really
a
mystical
process
but
totally
logical
for
example
every
instruction
should
show
some
working
and
not
just
alter
registermemoryport
contents
does
anyone
know
of
any
freelyavailable
example
simulation
code
in
pascal
or
that
would
show
me
where
im
going
wrong
in
writing
my
simulator
im
using
ayalas
the
microcontroller
as
a
reference
the
simulator
supplied
with
the
package
is
overkill
for
simple
teaching
purposes
i
feel
and
theres
no
source
code
to
help
you
roll
your
own
please
email
me
if
you
can
help
or
if
you
know
of
somewhere
more
appropriate
i
should
be
posting
this
i
rarely
scan
these
groups
thanks
