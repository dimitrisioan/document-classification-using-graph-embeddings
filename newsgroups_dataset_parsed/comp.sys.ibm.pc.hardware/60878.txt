speed
leds
for
a
gateway
motherboard
hi
i
recently
got
a
towercase
for
my
gateway
file
server
mostly
because
we
needed
the
extra
drive
bays
and
better
power
supply
this
case
has
leds
for
the
processor
speed
ie
is
there
a
place
to
plug
this
in
on
the
motherboard
if
not
is
there
anyway
to
hack
something
to
make
it
work
