hi
i
recently
switched
my
old
amiga
with
a
my
computer
configuration
is
mhz
kb
eisa
micronics
motherboard
asic
eisa
ram
mb
harddisk
scsi
eisa
cache
controller
when
i
use
harddisk
benchmark
i
get
a
harddisk
data
transfer
about
kbsec
and
sometimes
is
that
good
i
thought
that
with
eisa
i
could
get
about
somewhere
in
the
manual
for
my
harddisk
i
have
read
that
some
host
adapters
need
to
perform
a
lowlevel
format
to
optimize
the
harddisk
performance
in
that
system
do
i
need
that
a
guy
i
know
gets
a
hd
transfer
about
and
he
has
an
and
a
isa
how
can
a
isa
with
the
same
system
be
faster
is
there
anything
that
i
can
do
to
get
a
speedier
harddisk
dont
rely
on
benchmarks
they
often
show
incorrect
due
to
different
tsr
programs
scsi
often
needs
a
driver
to
get
the
speed
from
the
card
make
sure
the
card
is
operating
in
synchronus
mode
which
is
faster
you
can
disable
disconnect
and
get
some
kbs
but
just
to
loose
the
mouse
or
other
ints
when
diskaccesing
i
get
