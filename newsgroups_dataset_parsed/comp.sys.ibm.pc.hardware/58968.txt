WHEN
I
USE

BENCHMARK
I
GET
A
HARDDISK
DATA
TRANSFER
ABOUT
KBSEC

SOMETIMES

THAT
GOOD
I
THOUGHT
THAT
WITH
EISA
I
COULD
GET
ABOUT
SOMEWHERE
IN
THE
MANUAL
FOR
MY
HARDDISK
I
HAVE
READ
THAT
SOME
HOST
ADAPTERS
NEED
TO
PERFORM
A
LOWLEVEL
FORMAT
TO
OPTIMIZE
THE
HARDDISK
PERFORMANCE
IN
THAT
SYSTEM
DO
I
NEED
THAT
A
GUY
I

GETS
A

HE
HAS
AN

HOW
CAN
A

BE
FASTER
IS
THERE
ANYTHING
THAT
I
CAN
DO
TO
GET
A
SPEEDIER
HARDDISK
DONT
RELY
ON
BENCHMARKS

OFTEN
SHOW
INCORRECT
DUE
TO
DIFFERENT
TSR
PROGRAMS
SCSI
OFTEN
NEEDS
A
DRIVER
TO
GET
THE
SPEED
FROM
THE

MAKE
SURE
THE

IS
OPERATING
IN
SYNCHRONUS
MODE
WHICH
IS
