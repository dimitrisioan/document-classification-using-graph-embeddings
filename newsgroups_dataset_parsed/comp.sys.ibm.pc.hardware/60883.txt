hi
i
recently
purchased
the
toshiba
cdrom
i
own
an
adaptec
scsi
card
and
i
have
so
far
failed
to
get
the
cdrom
to
work
under
dos
it
works
very
well
under
so
i
know
that
the
drive
is
not
faulty
in
my
configsys
i
have
aspidisksys
aspicdsys
in
my
autoexecbat
i
have
mscdex
which
came
with
dos
mscdex
seems
to
find
and
install
the
drive
as
drive
f
but
when
i
switch
to
that
drive
and
try
a
dir
i
get
an
error
message
telling
me
the
drive
is
not
ready
or
something
like
that
the
cdrom
is
locked
too
and
the
adaptec
utilities
dont
seem
to
recognize
that
i
have
a
cdrom
at
that
point
the
current
adaptec
drivers
do
not
support
the
toshiba
you
should
get
the
corel
scsi
drivers
which
do
support
it
this
is
the
method
that
i
used
and
it
works
well
corels
phone
number
is
just
