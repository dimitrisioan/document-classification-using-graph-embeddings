WRITES
HI
I
RECENTLY
PURCHASED
THE
TOSHIBA
CDROM
I
OWN
AN
ADAPTEC
SCSI
CARD
AND
I
HAVE
SO
FAR
FAILED
TO
GET
THE
CDROM
TO
WORK
UNDER
DOS
IT
WORKS
VERY
WELL
UNDER
SO
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
DRIVE
IS
NOT
FAULTY
IN
MY
CONFIGSYS
I
HAVE
ASPIDISKSYS
ASPICDSYS
IN
MY
AUTOEXECBAT
I
HAVE
MSCDEX
WHICH
CAME
WITH
DOS
MSCDEX
SEEMS
TO
FIND
AND
INSTALL
THE
DRIVE
AS
DRIVE
F
BUT
WHEN
I
SWITCH
TO
THAT
DRIVE
AND
TRY
A
DIR
I
GET
AN
ERROR
MESSAGE
TELLING
ME
THE
DRIVE
IS
NOT
READY
OR
SOMETHING
LIKE
THAT
THE
CDROM
IS
LOCKED
TOO
AND
THE
ADAPTEC
UTILITIES
DONT
SEEM
TO
RECOGNIZE
THAT
I
HAVE
A
CDROM
AT
THAT
POINT
THE
CURRENT
ADAPTEC
DRIVERS
DO
NOT
SUPPORT
THE
TOSHIBA
YOU
SHOULD
GET
THE
COREL
SCSI
DRIVERS
WHICH
DO
SUPPORT
IT
THIS
IS
THE
METHOD
THAT
I
USED
AND
IT
WORKS
WELL
