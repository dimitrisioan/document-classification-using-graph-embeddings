upgrades

what
are
the
current
products
available
to
upgrade
the
resolution
which
ones
support
postscript
any
experiences
with
them
either
good
or
bad
is
the
quality
difference
really
noticable
im
planning
on
producing
camera
ready
copy
of
homes
will
the
higher
resolution
be
noticed
for
these
if
you
are
talking
about
laser
jet
then
i
believe
it
has
to
be
postscript
i
dont
see
any
advantage
to
using
pcl
when
you
have
a
peice
of
hardware
plugged
into
the
that
is
doing
the
work
and
it
can
support
any
language
that
is
suited
for
the
job
besides
i
dont
think
pcl
is
even
capable
of
handling
dpi
specifications
i
only
have
experience
with
the
laser
master
winjet
which
brings
the
up
to
dpi
and
it
uses
postscript
it
also
has
a
fast
print
mode
which
is
not
postscript
and
it
is
at
a
lower
resolution
i
think
but
it
is
fast
this
particular
product
uses
your
host
processor
to
process
the
postscript
so
even
with
a
decent
pc
you
know
its
going
to
be
slow
ie
slow
compared
to
a
highend
workstation
processed
ps
the
quality
difference
is
very
noticable
and
is
almost
worth
the
wait
for
the
ps
processing
im
rather
impatient
we
were
using
it
for
bw
camera
images
the
gray
scale
image
was
accepted
by
ms
word
and
handed
to
the
winjet
ps
printer
driver
which
converts
the
image
into
postscript
and
then
hands
it
off
to
the
winjets
postscript
processor
the
postscript
is
rendered
into
ram
lots
of
it
and
when
it
is
done
it
shoots
it
directly
to
the
printer
the
ps
processor
can
also
accept
ps
files
created
from
other
sources
including
dos
applications
but
windows
has
to
be
running
at
the
time
of
printing
the
ps
processor
is
responsible
for
the
halftoning
and
id
say
it
does
a
pretty
good
job
our
camera
images
came
out
very
good
in
my
opinion
not
as
good
as
laser
masters
demo
though
i
dont
know
how
many
other
similar
products
are
out
there
but
i
would
be
surprised
if
there
are
several
gordon
lang
