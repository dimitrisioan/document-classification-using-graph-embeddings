datdds
like
st
wrote
as
far
as
i
can
tell
the
md
is
an
offshoot
of
technology
that
already
exists
it
is
an
mo
drive
mo
drives
exist
already
for
computers
theyre
expensive
and
a
bit
slow
but
the
disks
are
cheep

dan
i
read
a
recent
article
in
personal
computer
world
mainly
about
the
new
digit
audion
formats
dcc
and
md
but
at
the
end
talked
about
how
nice
it
would
be
to
use
these
for
data
storage
with
a
brief
calculation
of
how
much
data
you
could
store
the
author
had
been
talking
to
someone
from
sony
about
these
formats
and
mentioned
this
to
get
the
reply
md
is
a
purely
audio
format
we
wouldnt
use
it
for
data
then
when
pressed
for
info
about
mo
the
sony
man
basically
admitted
that
it
was
no
more
than
a
slight
adaptabtion
on
md
what
i
think
the
original
poster
was
wanting
was
mo
drives
at
md
audio
player
prices
id
assume
that
the
problem
here
is
that
an
md
system
can
have
higher
tolerances
than
an
mo
system
as
the
ear
doesnt
pick
up
the
occasional
bit
error
as
well
as
an
archiving
program
