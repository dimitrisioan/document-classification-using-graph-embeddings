re
adding
a
second
ide
drive
i
just
bought
a
western
digitalcaviar
ide
drive
and
i
want
to
add
it
to
my
system
which
already
has
a
ide
drive
the
controller
says
it
supports
hard
drives
but
when
i
plug
in
the
cables
do
the
bios
setup
and
try
to
start
the
system
it
pauses
and
then
i
get
an
invalid
drive
d
error
message
the
system
boots
but
i
cannot
access
the
new
hard
drive
there
are
jumpers
on
each
drive
that
must
be
set
for
both
to
work
the
c
drivemust
be
set
to
be
the
master
drive
and
d
must
be
set
to
be
the
slave
drive
the
actual
settings
should
be
in
info
with
the
drives
or
is
available
from
western
digital
