RE
ADDING
A
SECOND
IDE
DRIVE
I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
WESTERN
DIGITALCAVIAR
IDE
DRIVE
AND
I
WANT
TO
ADD
IT
TO
MY
SYSTEM
WHICH
ALREADY
HAS
A
IDE
DRIVE
THE
CONTROLLER
SAYS
IT
SUPPORTS
HARD
DRIVES
BUT
WHEN
I
PLUG
IN
THE
CABLES
DO
THE
BIOS
SETUP
AND
TRY
TO
START
THE
SYSTEM
IT
PAUSES
AND
THEN
I
GET
AN
INVALID
DRIVE
D
ERROR
MESSAGE
THE
SYSTEM
BOOTS
BUT
I
CANNOT
ACCESS
THE
NEW
HARD
DRIVE
THERE
ARE
JUMPERS
ON
EACH
DRIVE
THAT
MUST
BE
SET
FOR
BOTH
TO
WORK
THE
C
DRIVEMUST
BE
SET
TO
BE
THE
MASTER
DRIVE
AND
D
MUST
BE
SET
TO
BE
THE
SLAVE
DRIVE
THE
ACTUAL
SETTINGS
SHOULD
BE
IN
INFO
WITH
THE
DRIVES
OR
IS
AVAILABLE
FROM
WESTERN
DIGITAL
