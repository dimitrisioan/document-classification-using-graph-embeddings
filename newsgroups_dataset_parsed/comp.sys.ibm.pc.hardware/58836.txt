hi
folks
yesterday
i
visited
the
cebit
hannover
germany
where
intel
was
presenting
the
pentium
processor
they
had
four
in
words
machines
with
this
beast
running
so
they
presented
it
nicely
unly
by
running
picture
shows
this
i
could
do
on
a
the
presentor
promised
it
to
be
binary
compatible
to
the
and
i
said
i
dont
believe
i
showed
him
a
onedisk
linuxsystem
emergency
disk
with
patched
lilo
to
boot
from
disk
and
said
him
convice
me
boot
this
no
guts
no
glory
a
he
decided
no
glory
he
wont
let
anybody
touch
his
holy
cows
and
not
even
boot
a
suspect
os
i
thought
by
myself
this
is
the
coward
of
the
day
and
went
back
to
earth
what
cn
we
learn
this
technology
is
far
from
industrialstandarts
so
you
can
expect
this
beast
in
your
local
computershop
at
least
in
spring
next
year
only
my
yes
only
your
heres
mine
if
i
were
running
at
a
new
chip
at
a
trade
show
and
had
little
to
no
real
technical
knowledge
i
wouldnt
let
some
stranger
with
a
diskette
boot
my
demo
machine
if
the
demo
machine
is
down
too
long
people
will
not
see
my
nice
demos
and
if
this
purposted
linux
diskette
is
really
something
that
will
wipe
the
disk
or
is
loaded
with
a
virus
im
in
deep
trouble
no
marketer
in
their
right
mind
would
let
you
do
this
unless
they
had
specifically
invited
people
to
do
so
and
provided
machines
to
do
it
with
we
can
we
learn
this
technology
will
be
shipping
from
pc
vendors
in
may
and
will
be
compatible
