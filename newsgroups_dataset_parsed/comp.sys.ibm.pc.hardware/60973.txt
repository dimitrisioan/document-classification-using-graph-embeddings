running
windows
im
planning
to
buy
an
ati
graphic
ultra
next
semester
is
that
all
i
need
to
get
the
problem
solved
is
ram
chips
too
slow
for
my
machine
do
faster
ram
chips
make
a
big
difference
i
use
cad
software
on
my
computer
as
well
do
those
upgrades
good
enough
to
speed
it
up
a
lot
any

experienced
the
difference
between
isa
bus
and
vl
busboth
with
a
graphic
accelerator
a
scsi
controller
may
not
be
appropriate
since
i
may
have
to
replace
my
hard
disks
as
well
however
sometimes
i
do
have
huge
files
on
my
computer
does
it
really
worth
to
use
a
scsi
interface
i
cant
spend
too
much
on
it

will
be
appreciated
