GAMECARDS
I
OWN
AN
RAM
MACHINE
AND
AM
FINDING
IT
TOO
SLOW
FOR
CERTAIN
GAMES
SUCH
AS
XWING
I
WAS
IN
A
COMPUTER
STORE
THERE
THE
OTHER
DAY
AND
SAW
A
SERIES
OF
GAMECARDS
WHICH
CLAIM
TO
SPEED
UP
YOUR
MACHINE
TO
UP
TO
I
WAS
WONDERING
IF
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
WHO
HAS
A
SIMILAR
MACHINE
HAD
BOUGHT
ONE
OR
SEEN
ONE
OF
THESE
GAMECARDS
AND
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
DO
ACTUALLY
WORK
ANY
HELP
HERE
WOULD
BE
MUCH
APPRECIATED
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
