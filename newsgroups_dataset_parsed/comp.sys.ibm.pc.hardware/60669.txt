gamecards
i
own
an
ram
machine
and
am
finding
it
too
slow
for
certain
games
such
as
xwing
i
was
in
a
computer
store
there
the
other
day
and
saw
a
series
of
gamecards
which
claim
to
speed
up
your
machine
to
up
to
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
out
there
who
has
a
similar
machine
had
bought
one
or
seen
one
of
these
gamecards
and
whether
or
not
they
do
actually
work
any
help
here
would
be
much
appreciated
thanks
in
advance
