does

yes
there
is
a
dx
and
version
of
the
if
you
are
considering
buying
one
or
the
other
definitely
go
for
the
dx
with
a
nice
size
external
cache
the
performance
is
far
greater
the
only
has
the
internal
cache
to
work
with
at
while
the
dx
has
a
potentially
much
larger
cache
to
work
at
with
neither
systems
could
actually
run
a
program
out
of
main
memory
since
dram
is
still
too
slow
for
that
high
