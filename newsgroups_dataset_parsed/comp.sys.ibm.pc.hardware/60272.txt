WRITES
OH
YEAH
I
JUST
READ
IN
ANOTHER
NEWSGROUP
THAT
THE
USES
A
HIGH
QUALITY
TRINITRON
TUBE
THAN
IS
IN
MOST
MONITORSTHE
SONY
FOR
EXAMPLE
AND
THIS
IS
WHERE
THE
EXTRA
COST
COMES
FROM
IT
IS
ALSO
WHERE
THE
HIGH
BANDWIDTH
COMES
FROM
AND
THE
FANTASTIC
IMAGE
AND
THE
LARGE
IMAGE
SIZE
ETC
ETC
ITS
ALSO
WHERE
THE
TWO
ANNOYING
LINES
ACROSS
THE
SCREEN
ONE
A
THIRD
DOWN
THE
OTHER
TWO
THIRDS
DOWN
COME
FROM
THE
LINES
ARE
NOT
A
RESULT
OF
THE
HIGH
END
TRINITRON
TUBE
THESE
WIRES
WILL
BE
FOUND

ALL
TRINITRON
TUBES
EG
MITSUBISHI
SONY
ETC
ON
SONY
TUBES
YOULL
FIND
ONE
WIRE
THEIR
LEVEL
OF
ANNOYANCE
IS
PURELY
SUBJECTIVE
IM
SO
HAPPY
WITH
THE
SHARPNESS
OF
THE

I
DONT
EVEN
NOTICE
THE
LINES
THE
USES
A
TRINITRON
SA
TUBE
WHICH
WHEN
VIEWED
AS
A
COMPLETE
TUBE
HAS
A
LARGER
DIAMETER
THAN
THE
STANDARD
TRINITRON
TUBE
THIS
RESULTS
IN
A
FLATTER
SCREEN
THAN
OTHER
MONITORS
USING
THE
STANDARD
TRINITRON
WHICH
HAS
A
VERTICALLY
FLAT
BUT
NOT
HORIZONTALLY
FLAT
SURFACE
AND
APPARENTLY
