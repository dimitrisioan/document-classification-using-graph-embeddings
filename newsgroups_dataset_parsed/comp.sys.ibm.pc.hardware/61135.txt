writes
which
would
you
choose
and
why
i
have
both
i
have
ide
only
on
my
dros
box
and
ide
and
scsi
on
my
unix
box
ide
on
the
dros
box
cos
it
only
has
a
hard
disk
scsi
on
my
unix
box
cos
it
has
a
scsi
hard
disk
cdrom
and
tape
i
bought
scsi
as
it
makes
adding
many
devices
easier
for
the
price
of
one
irq
and
dma
i
have
three
different
types
of
device
connected
up
faster
drives
are
also
available
for
scsi
i
have
a
dec
that
realy
does
have
a
average
seek
time
ie
it
finds
data
faster
than
my
toshiba
drive
like
lots
of
people
id
really
like
to
increase
my
data
transfer
rate
from
the
hard
drive
right
now
i
have
a
ide
drive
seagate
and
a
standard
ide
controller
card
on
my
isa
i
dont
think
that
scsi
will
increase
your
data
transfer
much
on
an
isa
bus
im
currently
thinking
about
adding
another
hd
in
the
to
range
and
im
thinking
hard
about
buying
a
scsi
drive
scsi
for
the
future
benefit
i
believe
im
getting
something
like
transfer
right
now
according
to
nu
is
pretty
good
how
would
this
number
compare
if
i
bought
the
stateoftheart
scsi
card
for
my
isa
pc
and
the
stateoftheart
scsi
hard
drive
the
best
system
i
could
hope
for
many
state
of
the
art
scsi
disks
use
the
same
mechanicals
as
many
state
of
the
art
ide
drives
only
the
interface
electronis
differ
look
at
the
fijitsu
drive
for
an
example
obviously
money
factors
into
this
choice
as
well
as
any
other
but
what
would
you
want
to
use
on
your
isa
system
and
how
much
would
it
cost
i
use
an
adaptec
on
my
unix
box
and
noname
ide
cards
on
both
along
those
lines
what
kind
of
transfer
rate
could
i
see
with
my
ide
hds
if
i
were
to
buy
the
topoftheline
ide
caching
controller
for
my
hd
and
how
much
would
it
cost
caching
controller
why
what
does
it
give
you
that
smartdrive
for
dos
does
not
about
extra
lower
memory
thats
about
it
a
properly
configured
main
memory
cache
will
produce
better
results
than
a
caching
controller
my
unix
reads
reads
data
from
its
main
memory
cache
at
thats
faster
than
the
standards
isa
bus
can
ever
sustain
thanks
