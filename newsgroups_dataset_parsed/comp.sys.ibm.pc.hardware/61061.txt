q
internal
modems
without
uart
seeing
all
these
questions
about
uart
types
their
availability
and
their
relative
merits
wouldnt
it
be
fine
if
for
internal
highspeed
modems
there
were
a
mode
of
operation
bypassing
the
dull
and
stupid
uart
interface
and
instead
accessing
directly
the
relatively
large
sendreceive
buffers
of
the
modem
thus
eliminating
all
problems
with
interrupt
latencies
just
an
idea
