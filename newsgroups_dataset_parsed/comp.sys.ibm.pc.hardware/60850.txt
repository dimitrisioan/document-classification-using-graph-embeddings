SURPRISE
ACTUALLY
AFTER
READING
THIS
GROUP
IM
SURPRISED
THAT
THEY
EVEN
HAVE
A
LOCAL

I
HAVE
A
CHOICE
NOW
BETWEEN
BASICALLY
THE
ABOVE
SYSTEM
BUT
WITH
A
WITH
ISA
AND
VLB
OR
A
WITH
EISA
AND
NO
VLB
AND
THUS
THE
NONLOCAL

VERSION
OF
THE
ATI

WHICH
IS
BETTER
KEEPING
IN
MIND
THAT
IM
PRIMARILY
INTERESTED
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
TASKS
ANY
HELP
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
I
NEED
TO
DECIDE
QUICKLY
SO
ANY
SPEEDY
HELP
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
EVEN
