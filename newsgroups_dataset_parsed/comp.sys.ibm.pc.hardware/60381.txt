WAYNE
SMITH
WRITES
I
JUST
BOUGHT
AT
QUANTUM
FOR
MY
MAC
AT
HOME
I
PAID
FOR
IT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IDE
DRIVES
CHEAPER
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
JUST
GOT
A
MAXTOR
MEG
IDE
DRIVE
FOR
THATS
MILLION
BYTES
OR
MEGABYTES
WITH
THE
BASIC
INTERFACE
HE
GETS
CLOSE
TO
MEGSEC
TRANSFER
ON
HIS
DOES
YOUR
FIGURE
INCLUDE
A
FEW
HUNDRED
FOR
SCSI
DRIVERS
SINCE
THE
MAC
USES
ONLY
FOR
HARD
DRIVES
YES
THE
FIGURE
INCLUDES
A
HUNDRED
FOR
SCSI
DRIVERS
THIS
IS
SLOPPY
PEOPLE
AND
DUMB
BUT
ON
THAT
POINT
IS
IT
FASTER
THIS
IS
WHAT
ALL
THIS
IS
ABOUT
DO
YOU
GET
MORE
PERFORMANCE
FOR
THE
MONEY
OK
ONCE
AGAIN
WITH
THE
SCSI
SPEC
LIST
WITH
A
CONTROLER
CHIP
SYNCHRONOUS
RANGE
IS
INDEED
ASYNCHRONOUS
RANGE
IS
SLOWER
AT
WITH
A
CONTROLLER
CHIP
WITH
BURST
NOTE
THE
INCREASE
IN
SPEED
THE
MAC
QUADRA
USES
THIS
VERSION
OF
SO
IT
DOES
EXIST
SOME
PCS
USE
THIS
SET
UP
TOO
MODE
WITH
BURST
FOR
THOSE
WHO
WANT
BUT
DONT
WANT
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
OR
HARDWARE
OR
MESS
WITH
THE
SOFTWARE
CONTROLLERS
USABLE
BY
DEVICES
WITH
CLOSE
TO
SPEEDS
OR
FAST
MODE
WITH
BURST
AND
FAST
WITH
BURST
ON
THE
OTHER
INTERFACES
LET
SPEAK
IDE
RANGES
FROM
AGAIN
SYNCHRONOUS
AND
ASYNCHRONOUS
MODES
WITH
ASYNCHRONOUS
MUCH
SLOWER
RANGE
ESDI
IS
ALWAYS
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
SOME
NONSTANDARD
VERSIONS
ONE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
INCONSITANT
USE
OF
THE
TERM
SCSI
IN
ARTICLES
AND
BY
PEOPLE
ITS
PROPER
MEANING
IS
THE
SET
OF
SCSI
INTERFACES
COMPOSED
OF
AND
LOOK
AT
THE
INCONSITANT
USE
OF
SCSI
IN
THE
BELOW
QUOTE
MY
COMMENTS
IN
PC
MAGAZINE
APRIL
ALTHOUGH
SCSI
IS
TWICE
AS
FAST
AS
ESDI
THIS
IS
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
FASTER
THAN
IDE
THIS
IS
BOTH
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
AND
TO
READ
CONSITANTLY
THE
QUOTE
SHOULD
READ
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
ALTHOUGH
ASYNCHRONOUS
IS
TWICE
AS
FAST
AS
ESDI
ONE
THIRD
THE
SPEED
OF
IDE
OR
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
OR
ALTHOUGH
WITH
A
CHIP
AND
ARE
EIGHT
TIMES
AS
FAST
AS
ESDI
FASTER
THAN
IDE
NOTE
THE
NONUSE
OF
SCSI
BY
ITSELF
THIS
ELIMINATES
AMBAGUITY
DRIVERS
ARE
SOMEWHAT
REASONABLE
WHILE
AND
DRIVERS
ARE
VERY
EXPANSIVE
CAN
USE
DRIVERS
WITH
LITTLE
SPEED
DEGRIDATIONTHE
MAC
QUADRA
DOES
EXACTLY
THIS
IF
WE
ARE
TO
CONTINUE
THIS
THREAD
STATE
CLEARLY
WHICH
SCSI
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
OR
OR
SCSI
OVER
ALL
AND
IT
DOES
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
