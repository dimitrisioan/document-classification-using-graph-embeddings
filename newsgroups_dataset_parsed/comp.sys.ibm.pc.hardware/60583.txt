PINS
HELLO
I
HAVE
A
HAYES
MODEN
WITH
NO
CABLES
OR
MANUALS
THE
MODEM
REQUIRES
A
SOURCE
OF
AC
BUT
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
TO
CONNECT
THE
POWER
SOURCE
TO
THE
PIN
CONNECTOR
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
TOP
PIN
IS
THE
GROUND
SO
I
WOULD
GUESS
THAT
THE
OTHER
TWO
ARE
THE
AC
PINS
RIGHT
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
HINTS
PLEASE
EMAIL
ME

REALLY
NEED
HELP
THANKS
