hayes
external
ac
pins
hello
i
have
a
hayes
moden
with
no
cables
or
manuals
the
modem
requires
a
source
of
ac
but
i
do
not
know
how
to
connect
the
power
source
to
the
pin
connector
i
know
that
the
top
pin
is
the
ground
so
i
would
guess
that
the
other
two
are
the
ac
pins
right
if
you
have
any
hints
please
email
me
i
really
need
help
thanks
