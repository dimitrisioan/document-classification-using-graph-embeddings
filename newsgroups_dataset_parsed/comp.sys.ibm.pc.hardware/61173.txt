a
ide
drive
and
am
having
a
few
problems
i
get
data
error
on
drive
c
messages
when
reading
some
files
the
problem
is
also
steadily
getting
worse
i
have
run
some
diagnostic
software
pctools
and
it
says
that
the
drive
is
ok
but
it
does
have
to
retry
some
sectors
and
it
briefly
flashes
up
an
error
message
which
is
too
quick
to
read
does
anybody
know
of
any
cheap
or
free
software
which
could
mark
these
sectors
as
bad
dos
doesnt
or
preferably
perform
a
low
level
format
i
have
heard
that
the
latter
is
possible
on
an
ide
technical
answers
would
be
appreciated

would
be
nice
to
be
able
to
use
the
disk
again

am
running
msdos
on

at
clone
