io
card
in
my
pc
when

plug
in
wang
modem
at
works
if
i
change
it
to
it
doesnt
program
chkport
gives
diagnostics
like
possible
com
irq
conflict
at
with
mouse
driver
in
memory
since
your
iocard
only
has
one
serial
port
this
should
default
to
under
msdos
you
cant
share
irqs
so
youll
have
to
set
either
your
modem
or
your
mouse
to
using
different
adresses
and
irqs
when
you
set
two
devices
onto
the
same
irq
like
and
or
and
the
latter
one
will
always
win
ie
if
you
have
your
mouse
on
and
start
using
your
modem
on
your
modem
should
work
but
your
mouse
will
stop
doing
so
until
reboot
it
should
be
no
problem
setting
your
modem
to
you
didnt
write
anything
about
other
peripherals
i
hope
it
helped
a
bit
byte
oli
hi

kind
of
new
at
the
pc
stuff
my
machine
has
serial
ports
com
and
share
same
irqs
you
mean
i
cant
plug
a
mouse
into
and
a
modem
into
and
expect
both
to

if
answer
is
no
should
i
change
