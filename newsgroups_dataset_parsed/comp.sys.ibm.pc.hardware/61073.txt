does
anyone
know
if
there
are
any
problems
or
if
its
possible
adding
a
third
hard
drivescsi
to
a
dos
pc
i
currently
have
a
pc
with
future
domain
scsi
board
and
maxtor
scsi
drives
installed
they
work
great
i
havent
had
any
problems
well
now
i
want
more
disk
space
and
went
out
and
got
another
larger
scsi
hard
disk
thinking
all
i
had
to
do
was
add
it
to
the
ribbon
that
has
connectors
and
run
the
fdisk
program
to
formatinitialize
the
disk
that
didnt
happen
when
the
pc
boots
the
scsi
prom
shoots
back
the
devices
that
are
attached
to
the
boardtarget
all
three
disks
are
seen
when
i
run
the
dos
fdisk
program
to
format
the
disk
i
choose
to
select
another
diskoption
and
voila
its
not
there
the
first
two
disks
show
up
no
problem
but
the
third
disk
is
nowhere
to
be
found
i
have
got
an
adaptec
scsi
card
that
comes
with
its
own
version
of
fdisk
the
problem
with
dos
is
that
it
will
only
see
two
hard
disks
any
more
need
to
be
done
by
device
drivers
odd
fdisk
works
fine
for
me
with
ide
drives
and
a
scsi
drive
on
my
ultrastor
only
with
the
device
driver
loaded
though
