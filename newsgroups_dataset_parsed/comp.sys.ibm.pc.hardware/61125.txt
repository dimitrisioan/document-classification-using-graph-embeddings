this
may
be
a
very
naive
question
but
is
there
any
basis
for
the
claim
that
a
cpu
will
get
hotter
when
a
computationally
intensive
job
is
running
my
friend
claims
that
there
will
be
little
difference
in
the
temperature
of
an
idle
cpu
and
a
cpu
running
a
computationally
intensive
job
from
what
ive
seen
in
coursework
most
cpus
never
actually
idle
they
will
continue
to
service
interrupts
etc
etc
the
clock
will
always
be
running
at
n
mhz
no
matter
what
its
doing
i
suppose
depending
on
the
instruction
the
cpu
may
use
circuitry
which
has
more
transistors
than
other
instructions
but
if
you
consider
the
additional
heat
generated
by
only
a
handful
of
additional
tiny
resistors
and
then
spread
that
heat
dissipation
over
the
cpus
packaging
the
change
in
temperature
to
the
immediate
environment
ie
the
surface
of
the
package
will
be
negligible
