THIS
MAY
BE
A
VERY
NAIVE
QUESTION
BUT
IS
THERE
ANY
BASIS
FOR
THE
CLAIM
THAT
A
CPU
WILL
GET
HOTTER
WHEN
A
COMPUTATIONALLY
INTENSIVE
JOB
IS
RUNNING
MY
FRIEND
CLAIMS
THAT
THERE
WILL
BE
LITTLE
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
TEMPERATURE
OF
AN
IDLE
CPU
AND
A
CPU
RUNNING
A
COMPUTATIONALLY
INTENSIVE
JOB
FROM
WHAT
IVE
SEEN
IN
COURSEWORK
MOST
CPUS
NEVER
ACTUALLY
IDLE
THEY
WILL
CONTINUE
TO
SERVICE
INTERRUPTS
ETC
ETC
THE
CLOCK
WILL
ALWAYS
BE
RUNNING
AT
N
MHZ
NO
MATTER
WHAT
ITS
DOING
I
SUPPOSE
DEPENDING
ON
THE
INSTRUCTION
THE
CPU
MAY
USE
CIRCUITRY
WHICH
HAS
MORE
TRANSISTORS
THAN
OTHER
INSTRUCTIONS
BUT
IF
YOU
CONSIDER
THE
ADDITIONAL
HEAT
GENERATED
BY
ONLY
A
HANDFUL
OF
ADDITIONAL
TINY
RESISTORS
AND
THEN
SPREAD
THAT
HEAT
DISSIPATION
OVER
THE
CPUS
PACKAGING
THE
CHANGE
IN
TEMPERATURE
TO
THE
IMMEDIATE
ENVIRONMENT
IE
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
PACKAGE
