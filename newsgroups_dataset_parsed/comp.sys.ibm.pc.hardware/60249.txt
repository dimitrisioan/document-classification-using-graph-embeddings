APRIL
ALTHOUGH
SCSI
IS
TWICE
AS
FASST
AS
ESDI
FASTER
THAN
IDE
AND
SUPPORT
UP
TO
DEVICES
ITS
ACCEPTANCE
HAS
LONG
BEEN
STALLED
BY
INCOMPATABILITY
PROBLEMS
AND
INSTALLATION
HEADACHES
I
LOVE
IT
WHEN
MAGAZINE
WRITERS
MAKE
STUPID
STATEMENTS
LIKE
THAT
RE
PERFORMANCE
WHERE
DO
THEY
GET
THOSE
NUMBERS
ILL
LIST
THE
ACTUAL

RANGES
WHICH
SHOULD
CONVINCE
ANYONE
THAT
SUCH
A
STATEMENT
IS
ABSURD

RANGES

RANGES
FROM

RANGES
FROM
ESDI
IS
ALWAYS
ALTHOUGH
THERE
ARE
SOME
NONSTANDARD
VERSIONS
ALL
THIS
SHOWS
IS
THAT
YOU
DONT
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
SCSI
WITH
A
CONTROLER
CHIP
RANGE
IS
INDEED
AND
THAT
IS
ALL
YOU
HAVE
RIGHT
ABOUT
SCSI
WITH
A
CONTROLLER

WITH
BURST
NOTE
THE
INCREASE
IN

THE

QUADRA
USES
THIS

IT
DOES
EXIST
SOME

USE
THIS

UP
TOO
MODE

OR
FAST

AND
FAST
WITH

BY
YOUR
OWN
DATA
THE
ALTHOUGH
SCSI
IS
TWICE
AS
FAST
AS
ESDI
IS
CORRECT
WITH
A
CONTROLLER
CHIP
CAN
REACH
WHICH
IS

FASTER
THAN

IT
SHOULD
BE
BUT
MAY
STILL
BE
THERE
PART
OF
THIS
PROBLEM
IS
BOTH
MAC
AND
IBM
PC
ARE
INCONSIANT
ABOUT
WHAT
SCSI
IS
WHICH
THOUGH
IT
IS
WELL
DOCUMENTED
THAT
THE
QUADRA
HAS
A
CHIP
AN
APPLE
SALESPERSON
SAID
IT
USES
A
FAST
CHIP
NOT
AT
A
BURST
IT
DOES
NOT
IS
MAXIMUM
SYNCHRONOUS
AND
QUADRA
USES
ANSYNCHRONOUS
SCSI
WHICH
IS
SLOWER
IT
SEEMS
THAT
MAC
AND
IBM
SEE
INTERFACE
AND
THINK
WHEN
IT
MAYBE
A
INTERFACE
DRIVEN
IN
THE
MACHINE
BY
A
CONTROLLER
CHIP
IN
MODE
WHICH
IS
MUCH
FASTER
THEN
TRUE

GO
DONT

YOU
DONT
