I
HAVE
A
CLONE
WITH
A
DTC
ESDI
CONTROLLER
AND
TOSHIBA
MBYTE
DRIVE
SINCE
INSTALLING
DOS
WHEN
I
TRIED
TO
REINSTALL
SOFTWARE
FROM
OR
DISKS
WHEN
I
MOUNT
THE
SECONDTHIRDFOURTH
DISKS
DOS
DOESNT
RECOGNIZE
THAT
I
HAVE
CHANGED
FLOPPIES
IF
I
DO
A
DIR
I
SEE
THE
CONTENTS
OF
THE
PREVIOUS
DISKETTE
THE
ONLY
WAY
TO
GET
DOS
TO
RECOGNIZE
THAT
DISKETTES
HAVE
CHANGED
IS
TO
DO
A
LABEL
AND
THEN
TO
NOT
LABEL
THEM
BUYING
DOS
HAS
BEEN
A
COLOSSAL
MISTAKE
DOS
WAS
STABLE
AND
WORKED
WELL
WITH
MY
EQUIPMENT
I
HAVE
SUPERSTOR
PRO
AND
DESQVIEWX
WITH
QEMM
MANIFEST
ETC
SO
THERE
ARENT
ANY
FEATURES
OF
DOS
THAT
I
AM
USING
I
GUESS
I
SHOULD
ROLL
BACK
TO
DOS
BUT
I
AM
WARY
OF
WHAT
WILL
HAPPEN
WHEN
I
DO
IT
BESIDES
LIKE
A
FOOL
I
DONT
HAVE
A
DOS
BOOTABLE
DISK
ANYMORE
IVE
MADE
THE
SAME
MISTAKES
I
CAUTION
