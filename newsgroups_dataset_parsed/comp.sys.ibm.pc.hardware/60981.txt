WRITES
SPECIFICALLY
I
AM
INTERESTED
IN
THE
ULTRASTOR
VLB
SCSI
CONTROLLER
BEFORE
I
SHELL
OUT
THE
BUCKS
FOR
THIS
THING
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
GET
THE
STRAIGHT
SCOOP
FROM
SOMEONE
WHO
KNOWS
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
THIS
CONTROLLER
ANY
PROBLEMS
WITH
IT
I
HAD
ONE
AND
ON
THREE
DIFFERENT
MOTHERBOARDS
IT
DIDNT
WORK
WITH
NT
AND
IN
SOME
CASES
DOS
I
SENT
MINE
BACK
BUT
IT
IS
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
ON
SOME
SYSTEMS
SUCH
AS
MICRONICS
MOTHERBOARDS
IT
IS
NECESSARY
TO
SHUT
OFF
THE
INTERNAL
CACHE
ON
THE
TO
HAVE
IT
WORK
IVE
YET
TO
HEAR
FROM
SOMEONE
RUNNING
A
ON
ANY
MOTHERBOARD
WITH
NT
WITHOUT
SHUTTING
OFF
THE
CACHE
IF
YOU
GET
ONE
MY
ADVISE
IT
TO
BE
VERY
SURE
YOU
CAN
RETURN
IT
FIRST
RALPH
