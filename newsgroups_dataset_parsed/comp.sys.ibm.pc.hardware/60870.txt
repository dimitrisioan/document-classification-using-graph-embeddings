RATIONALE
THE
RATIONALE
FOR
THIS
PROPOSAL
IS
A
NEED
FOR
THOSE
INTERESTED
OR
INVOLVED
IN
THE
PUBLISHING
OF
CDROM
MATERIALS
TO
HAVE
A
FORUM
FOR
THE
DISCUSSION
RELATING
TO
THEIR

AT

THE
MAIN
FORA
FOR
SUCH
DISCUSSION
ARE
IN

JUST
BEEN
SETUP
IN

A

NOT

OUGHT
NOT

A
REPLACEMENT
FOR

THE
REASON
FOR
THE

A
NATURAL
PARTITION
OF

BETWEEN
