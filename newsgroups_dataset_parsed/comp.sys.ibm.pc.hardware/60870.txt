rationale
the
rationale
for
this
proposal
is
a
need
for
those
interested
or
involved
in
the
publishing
of
cdrom
materials
to
have
a
forum
for
the
discussion
relating
to
their
needs
at
the
moment
the
main
fora
for
such
discussion
are
in
altcdrom
and
compmultimedia
neither
of
which
have
publishing
as
their
focus
some
lists
serve
the
general
cdrom
community
with
focuses
on
library
government
and
network
usage
and
until
several
weeks
ago
none
were
devoted
to
publishing
cdpub
has
just
been
setup
in
any
case
a
list
is
not
and
ought
not
be
a
replacement
for
regular
usenet
newsgroups
the
reason
for
the
division
into
three
groups
is
a
natural
partition
of
interest
between
the
hardware
and
software
topics
and
between
the
two
main
focal
points
of
software
ie
fulltext
and
multimedia
publishing
topics
such
as
cdrom
xa
cdi
cdr
photo
cd
and
other
related
formats
would
be
included
as
well
topics
related
to
cdrom
publishing
that
are
neither
clearly
hardware
or
software
related
such
as
books
copyright
issues
and
other
legal
matters
packaging
distribution
could
be
included
in
the
purvue
of
comppublishcdromsoftware
as
would
any
other
nonhardware
or
multimedia
topic
that
relates
in
some
way
to
cdrom
publishing
in
any
format
and
is
appropriate
to
the
internet
the
main
focus
of
comppublishcdromsoftware
would
be
topics
such
as
index
and
retrieval
software
premastering
software
cdrom
simulation
software
hypertext
sgml
scanning
and
imaging
software
data
capture
software
data
clean
up
compression
encryption
etc
as
relates
to
publishing
cdroms
the
main
focus
of
comppublishcdrommultimedia
would
be
software
that
aids
in
the
multimedia
authoring
and
publishing
process
audio
and
video
the
main
focus
of
comppublishcdromhardware
would
be
hardware
that
relates
to
cdrom
publishing
as
well
as
hardware
for
data
capture
such
as
all
sorts
of
scanners
and
data
capture
hardware
as
well
as
information
that
publishers
need
to
know
about
the
hardware
that
the
intended
enduser
will
utilize
the
hardware
that
will
eventually
play
the
published
cdrom
including
networks
for
cdrom
notes
these
groups
are
not
to
be
used
for
topics
such
as
reviews
or
questions
relating
to
already
published
cdroms
or
reviews
or
questions
relating
to
general
purpose
cdrom
drives
and
the
like
requests
for
help
in
installing
a
cdrom

other
general
