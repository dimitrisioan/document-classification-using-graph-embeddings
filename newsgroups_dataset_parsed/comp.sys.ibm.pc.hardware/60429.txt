but
i
still
want
to
know
why
it
intrinsically
better
than
ide
on
an
isa
bus
when
it
comes
to
multitasking
oss
when
managing
data
from
a
single
scsi
hard
drive
a
scsi
controller
that
transfers
data
by
dma
allows
the
cpu
to
request
data
from
the
hard
drive
and
continue
working
while
the
controller
gets
the
data
and
moves
it
to
memory
ide
also
uses
dma
techniques
i
believe
floppy
controller
also
uses
dma
and
most
ad
boards
also
use
dma
dma
is
no
big
deal
and
has
nothing
to
do
directly
with
scsi
ide
does
not
do
dma
this
is
because
its
like
te
pc
at
hard
disk
interface
the
controller
moves
a
sector
to
some
buffer
memory
on
the
controller
card
then
the
cpu
moves
the
data
from
the
buffer
to
main
memory
where
its
needed
if
ide
doesnt
work
this
way
then
its
not
compatible
heck
if
ide
used
dma
then
youd
hear
all
kinds
of
complaints
about
isa
bus
systems
with
more
than
ram
not
working
with
their
ide
drives
is
the
dma
addressing
limit
of
the
isa
bus
and
if
ide
did
dma
there
would
be
trouble
btw
there
are
dmaenabling
signals
in
the
ide
cable
spec
but
the
last
report
i
heard
was
that
they
are
never
implemented
because
it
would
require
a
different
kind
of
ide
adapter
and
different
drivers
richard
krehbiel
richkgrebyncom
will
do
for
me
until
amigados
for
the
comes
along
