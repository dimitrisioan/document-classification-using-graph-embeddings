I
WONT
ARGUE
THAT
THE
SCSI
STANDARD
MAKES
FOR
A
GOOD
WELL
IMPLIMENTED
DATA
HIGHWAY
BUT
I
STILL
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHY
IT
INTRINSICALLY
BETTER
THAN
IDE
ON
AN
ISA
BUS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MULTITASKING
OSS
WHEN
MANAGING
DATA
FROM
A
SINGLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
I
HAVE
BEEN
FOLLOWING
THIS
THREAD
AND
FIGURED
ID
THROW
IN
MY
TWO
CENTS
THE
AMIGA
ZORRO
II
BUS
IS
COMPARABLE
WITH
THE
ISA
BUS
VS
MHZ
THE
AMIGA
HAS
HAD
A
PREEMPTATIVE
MULTITASKING
OS
SINCE
AND
CAN
OPERATE
WITH
MB
RAM
SCSI
IS
USED
ALMOST
EXCLUSIVELY
ON
THESE
SYSTEMS
A
SCSI
CONTROLLER
THAT
TRANSFERS
DATA
BY
DMA
ALLOWS
THE
CPU
TO
REQUEST
DATA
FROM
THE
HARD
DRIVE
AND
CONTINUE
WORKING
WHILE
THE
CONTROLLER
GETS
THE
DATA
AND
MOVES
IT
TO
MEMORY
A
CONTROLLER
THAT
ALLOWS
RESELECTION
CAN
OPERATE
EVEN
BETTER
WITH
MULTIPLE
DEVICES
THIS
IS
ESPICALLY
TRUE
WITH
SCSI
TAPE
UNITS
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHEN
REWINDING
OR
FORMATTING
A
TAPE
THE
COMMAND
IS
ISSUED
TO
THE
CONTROLLER
AND
THE
BUS
IS
RELEASED
TO
ALLOW
ACCESS
TO
OTHER
DEVICES
ON
THE
BUS
THIS
GREATLY
INCREASES
PRODUCTIVITY
OR
AT
LEAST
DO
SOMETHING
ELSE
WHILE
BACKING
UP
YOUR
HARD
DRIVE
WHICH
HAPPENS
TO
BE
WHAT
I
AM
DOING
WHILE
READING
THIS
GROUP
ITS
A
LONG
STORY
BUT
I
STILL
USE
IDE
ON
MY
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
CDROM
WHICH
THANKS
TO
SCSI
I
CAN
MOVE
BETWEEN
BOTH
MACHINES
IF
AND
WHEN
SCSI
IS
BETTER
STANDARDIZED
AND
SUPPORTED
ON
THE
IBMCLONE
MACHINES
I
PLAN
TO
COMPLETELY
GET
RID
OF
IDE
