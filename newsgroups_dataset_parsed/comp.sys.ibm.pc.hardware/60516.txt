THOMAS
D
BARRETT
WRITES
IN
ARTICLE
JOE
ZBICIAK
WRITES
WHATS
THE
WORD
ON
THE
CHIPSET
IS
THIS
A
ROM
BUG
SPECIFIC
TO
A
SPECIFIC
BRAND
USING
THE
ROCKWELL
OR
IS
IT
THE
ROCKWELL
CHIPSET
ITSELF
THERE
WERE
AN
ASSORTMENT
OF
FIRMWARE
PROBLEMS
BUT
THAT
IS
PRETTY
MUCH
EXPECTED
WITH
ANY
FAXMODEM
TALKING
WITH
A
DIFFERENT
FAX
OR
MODEM
WHICH
MAY
HAVE
ALSO
BEEN
REVISED
OR
IS
NEW
IM
PRETTY
MUCH
OBLIVIOUS
TO
ANY
CURRENT
FIRMWARE
PROBLEMS
SO
YOULL
HAVE
TO
GET
IT
FROM
SOMEONE
ELSE
SOMEONE
ELSE
COULD
YOU
PLEASE
COMMENT
ON
THAT
I
HAVE
JUST
BOUGHT
A
TWINCOM
WHICH
HAS
A
ROCKWELL
CHIPSET
IT
WASNT
CHEAP
SO
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
OF
PROBLEMS
IM
LIKELY
TO
RUN
INTO
HOWEVER
I
CAN
TELL
YOU
TO
STAY
CLEAR
OF
ANY
BOARD
WHICH
USES
THE
ROCKWELL
MPU
AS
OPPOSED
TO
THE
DPU
FOR
AN
INTERNAL
IMPLEMENTATION
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THE
MPU
USED
SPEED
BUFFERING
INSTEAD
OF
HAVING
A
INTERFACE
WITHOUT
THE
INTERFACE
THE
NUMBER
OF
INTERRUPTS
ARE
STILL
THE
SAME
AND
THUS
MAY
GET
DROPPED
UNDER
MULTITASKING
CONDITIONS
LIKE
IN
WINDOWS
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
THE
SPEED
BUFFERING
WORKS
OK
FOR
EXTERNAL
MODEMS
IF
A
IS
USED
ON
THE
INTERNAL
SERIAL
PORT
BOARD
PHEW
I
WAS
LUCKY
THE
TWINCOM
INTERNAL
VERSION
HAS
A
AND
ONE
OF
THE
ROCKWELL
CHIPS
IS
MARKED
BUT
STILL
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
HEAR
MORE
OF
THE
ABOVE
MENTIONED
FIRMWARE
PROBLEMS
NIELS
