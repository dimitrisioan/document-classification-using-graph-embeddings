GUY
DAWSON
WRITES
HOW
ABOUT
AN
VLB
ETHERNET
CARD
MOVE
THE
DATA
INTO
THE
CARD
AT
ODD
MBS
AND
THEN
WAIT
FOR
IT
TO
TICKLE
ONTO
THE
NET
AT
JUST
OVER
HOW
ABOUT
FOR
VLB
OR
FOR
QUICKRING
APPLES
IMPLIMENTATION
OF
VLB
BYTE
QUICKRING
IS
INTERESTING
IN
THAT
IT
ALLOWS
INTERLEAVING
WITH
OTHER
CARD
SO
THAT
THE
CAN
BE
DIVIDED
AMONG
MANY
CARDS
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
NUBUS
AND
MCA
ARE
ABOUT
THE
ONLY
CARD
INTERFACES
ABLE
TO
DO
ANYTHING
WITH
THAT
KIND
OF
SPEED
AND
EVEN
NUBUS
DITZES
AROUND
AT
WITH
A
BURST
MODE
MCA
ALSO
CALLED
MICRO
CHANNEL
IBMS
AND
BUS
ALLOWS
USE
OF
MORE
THAN
ONE
CPU
IN
A
COMPUTER
DCT
AND
ANYTHING
CAN
TALK
TO
ANYTHING
AS
FAST
AS
THE
TWO
COMPONENTS
INVOLVED
CAN
HANDLE
IT
NEVER
TOOK
OFF
BECAUSE
IT
WAS
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
ISA
AND
EISA
PLANNED
TO
BE
BUS
INTERFACE
OF
IBM
POWERPC
CARL
JABIDO
IDA
CANT
HANDLE
VLB
SPEED
NEVER
MIND
QUICKRINGSS
SPEED
SO
IT
IS
OUT
EISA
POKES
ALONG
AT
NUBUS
MAC
II
SPEEDS
BURST
MODE
SO
VLB
AND
QUICKRING
ARE
SLOWED
DOWN
BY
IT
PCI
IS
A
COMPETING
INTERFACE
THAT
IS
STILL
IN
DEVELOPMENT
