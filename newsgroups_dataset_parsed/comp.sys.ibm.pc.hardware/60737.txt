THE
CONNER
SET
TO
THE
MASTER
AND
THE
QUANTUM
SET
TO
THE
SLAVE
DOESNT
WORK
THE
OTHER
WAY
AROUND
I
AM
ABLE
TO
ACCESS
BOTH
DRIVES
IF
I
BOOT
FROM
A
FLOPPY
BUT
THE
DRIVES
WILL
NOT
BOOT
THEMSELVES
I
AM
RUNNING
MSDOS
AND
HAVE
THE
CONNER
PARTITIONED
AS
PRIMARY
DOS
AND
IS
FORMATTED
WITH
SYSTEM
FILES
I
HAVE
TRIED
ALL
DIFFERENT

OF
SETUPS
AND
EVEN
CHANGED
IDE
CONTROLLER
CARDS
IF
I
BOOT
FROM
A
FLOPPY

WORKS
GREAT
EXCEPT
THE
BOOTING
PART
THE
SYSTEM
DOESNT
REPORT
AN
ERROR
MESSAGE
OR
ANYTHING
JUST
HANGS
THERE
DOES
ANYONE
HAVE
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
OR
HAS
SOMEBODY
ELSE
RUN
INTO
A
SIMILAR
PROBLEM

WAS
THINKING
THAT
I
MIGHT
HAVE
TO
UPDATE
THE
BIOS
ON
ONE
OF
THE
DRIVES
IS
THIS
POSSIBLE
