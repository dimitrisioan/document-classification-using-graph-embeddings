cache
or
micronics
eisavlb
motherboard
this
might
be
a
silly
question
but
i
have
to
ask
it
anyway
i
am
in
the
process
of
purchasing
an
eisavl
bus
computer
and
i
found
two
places
that
sell
machines
that
have
what
i
want
and
have
the
same
price
the
first
is
ares
and
they
use
a
cache
motherboard
thats
the
brand
of
the
motherboard
with
opti
chip
set
the
other
is
micron
formerly
edge
technology
and
they
use
the
micronics
eisavlb
motherboard
i
said
that
this
might
be
a
silly
question
since
i
believe
that
micronics
is
a
very
well
known
motherboard
manufacturer
while
i
never
heard
of
cache
i
am
however
leaning
towards
the
ares
machine
because
my
impression
is
that
they
are
known
for
building
good
solid
machines
and
they
have
good
tech
support
hr
dayswk
and
a
better
warrantee
years
micron
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
recently
aquired
edge
technologies
and
im
not
sure
how
much
i
should
trust
the
company
i
would
really
appreciate
any
input
on
this
is
the
micron
machine
the
clear
choice
does
anyone
know
anything
positive
or
negative
about
either
company
has
anyone
ever
heard
of
cache
motherboards
should
i
go
with
micron
just
because
it
has
the
micronics
motherboard
etc
thanks
very
much
in
advance
for
any
information
