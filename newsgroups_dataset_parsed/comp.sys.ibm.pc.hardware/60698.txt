RE
ZEOS
COMPUTERS
I
HAVE
HAD
A
ZEOS
FOR
A
COUPLE
MONTHS
WHILE
THE
EXPERIENCE
WAS
NOT
PAINLESS
OR
PERFECT
IT
WAS
WAY
BETTER
THAN
THAT
ENDURED
BY
MOST
PEOPLE
I
PERSONALLY
KNOW
WHO
HAVE
ORDERED
GATEWAYS
OF
COURSE
SEVERAL
OF
THE
GATEWAY
BUYERS
WERE
REWARDED
BY
GETTING
FREE
STUFF
AS
GATEWAY
CANT
SEEM
TO
KEEP
TRACK
OF
WHAT
IT
HAS
OR
HASNT
SENT
OUTB
I
GOT
THE
MB
VIPER
CARD
THE
FIRST
ONE
WAS
DEFECTIVE
BUT
ZEOS
REPLACED
IT
WITH
ONLY
MINOR
HASSLES
THIS
ONE
WORKS
FINE
I
HAVENT
NOTICED
ANY
PROBLEMS
IN
ANY
OF
MY
APPLICATIONS
I
ALSO
ORDERED
IT
BECAUSE
OF
ALL
THE
COMPLAINTS
ABOUT
THE
ATI
A
FEW
MONTHS
AGO
GUESS
YOU
CAN
CHOOSE
EITHER
BUGGY
STATEOFTHEART
STUFF
OR
ROBUST
AVERAGE
STUFF
FOR
MY
PARTICULAR
CONFIGURATION
TOWER
WATT
SUPPLY
NO
MONITOR
VIPER
ETC
THE
ZEOS
WAS
SLIGHTLY
CHEAPER
THAN
GATEWAY
AUSTIN
ETC
BUT
THIS
CAN
CHANGE
FROM
MONTH
TO
MONTH
