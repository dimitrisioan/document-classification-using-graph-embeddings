date
is
stuck
on
john
bongiovanni
had
the
unmitigated
gall
to
say
this
suddenly
the
date
no
longer
rolls
over
the
time
is
reasonably
accurate
allways
but
we
have
to
change
the
date
by
hand
every
morning
this
involves
exiting
the
menu
system
to
get
to
dos
jb
did
i
once
hear
that
in
order
for
the
date
to
advance
something
like
jb
a
clock
has
to
make
a
get
date
system
call
apparently
the
clock
jb
hardware
interrupt
and
bios
dont
do
this
date
advance
jb
automatically
the
get
date
call
notices
that
a
midnight
reset
flag
jb
has
been
set
and
then
then
advances
the
date
when
a
program
uses
a
dos
call
to
get
the
system
it
resets
the
flag
that
tells
the
bios
that
it
has
passed
midnight
it
then
uses
this
flag
to
increment
the
date
if
the
menu
does
a
call
to
the
system
to
get
the
time
before
midnight
before
the
bios
sees
the
midnight
flag
then
bios
will
not
know
that
the
day
passed
and
the
date
will
not
get
updated
i
might
have
some
doss
and
bioss
mixed
up
darned
cold
messed
up
my
brains
but
this
has
been
a
well
documented
problem
for
years
i
dont
know
of
a
workaround
hope
this
helps
two
most
common
elements
in
the
universe
hydrogen
stupidity
blue

the
