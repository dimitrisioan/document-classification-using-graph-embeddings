WRITES
IN
THE
LATEST
PC
MAGAZINE
PENTIUM
ISSSUE
THERE
IS
AN
EDITORIAL
ON
THE
ADVANTAGES
OF
A
PC
USING
EISEVESALB
RATHER
THAN
JUST
PLAIN
ISAVESALB
SUPPOSEDLY
USERS
WILL
EVENTUALLY
WANT
MORE
THAN
OF
RAM
HOWEVER
SINCE
THE
ISA
BUS
HAS
ONLY
BITS
THEN
ANYTHING
ON
THE
BUS
CAN
ACCESS
ONLY
EVEN
IF
I
HAVE
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
SO
FAR
I
AGREE
WITH
THE
ARGUMENTS
THEN
THE
WRITER
CLAIMS
THAT
GLITCHES
CAN
OCCUR
IN
SYSTEMS
WITH
OVER
BECAUSE
OF
THAT
LIMIT
THAT
PART
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
BECAUSE
THE
RAM
IS
RIGHT
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
SO
THE
CPU
SHOULD
HAVE
NO
PROBLEMS
TALKING
WITH
THE
RAM
CAN
ANYBODY
EXPLAIN
THIS
THE
PROBLEM
IS
WITH
ISA
BUSMASTERS
WHICH
CAN
ONLY
ADDRESS
THE
FIRST
OF
SYSTEM
MEMORY
BUSMASTERS
DO
NOT
USE
THE
CPU
NOR
THE
SYSTEM
DMA
TO
DO
THE
ACTUAL
DATA
TRANSFER
BUT
TRANSFER
THEIR
DATA
DIRECTLY
TO
THE
SYSTEM
RAM
