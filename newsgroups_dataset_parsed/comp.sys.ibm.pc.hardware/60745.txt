HAVE
ANYBODY
SUCCEDED
IN
CONVERTING
A
ATARI
MONOMCHROME
MONITOR
INTO
A
MONO
VGA
MONITOR
IF
SO
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
EXACTLY
HOW
YOU
DID
AND
WHAT
GRAPHICS
CARD
YOU
USED
I
WISH
I
COULD
HELP
I
POSTED
A
SIMILAR
QUESTION
ABOUT
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
GOT
NO
RESPONSE
AT
ALL
IVE
ASKED
LOCALLY
AT
MY
FRIENDLY
ATARI
STORE
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
BUT
THAT
THEY
HAD
NO
IDEA
HOW
IT
MIGHT
BE
DONE
NOR
DID
THEY
PARTICULARLY
CARE
TO
INVESTIGATE
PLEASE
IF
ANYONE
HAS
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
POST
THEM
YOU
MIGHT
TRY
ASKING
ON
ONE
OF
THE
COMPSYSIBM
ECHOS
THE
BEST
ONE
MAY
BE
COMPSYSIBMPCHARDWARE
I
SAY
THIS
BECAUSE
THE
CONVERSION
SEEMS
MORE
GEARED
TOWARD
A
PC
USER
WANTING
TO
USE
THAT
MONITOR
THAN
AN
ATARI
USER
WHO
ALREADY
CAN
USE
THE
MONITOR
UNLESS
MAYBE
THEY
WANT
TO
REALLY
GO
WILD
CONVERTING
THE
MONITOR
TO
VGA
THEN
USING
IT
AS
A
VGA
MONITOR
WITH
A
FALCON
AS
FOR
GRAPHICS
CARDS
ASSUMING
THAT
THE
ATARI
MONITOR
CAN
BE
MODIFIEDADAPTED
TO
HANDLE
VGA
SIGNALS
YOU
SHOULD
PROBABLY
BE
ABLE
TO
USE
ANY
VGA
CARD
AT
LEAST
WITH
A
RES
AROUND
I
HAVENT
TRIED
THIS
BUT
THAT
WOULD
BE
MY
GUESS

YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
PRICE
MONO
VGA
MONITORS
ANYWAYS
IT
MAY
BE
CHEAPER
TO
GO
THAT
ROUTE
THAN
TO
DO
THE
CONVERSION
BESIDES
WITH
THE
FALCON
AND
BEYOND
VGASVGAMULTISYNC
MONITORS
WILL
PROBABLY
BE
THE
WAY
TO
GO
