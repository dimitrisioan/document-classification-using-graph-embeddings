is
distractingly
loud
has
anyone
found
a
solution
to
running
a
pc
with
peace
and
quiet
short
of
buying
a
notebook
pc
i
dont
know
what
to
do
oh

i
did
hear
about
a
power
supply
called
a
silencer
which
is
supposed
to
be
more
quiet
has
anyone
had
experience
with
this
i
was
quoted
a
price
of
for
a
silencer
ive
even
considered
stuffing
my
pc
case
in
one
of
those
acoustic
printer
enclosures
but
that
wouldnt
be
the
most
elegant
solution
