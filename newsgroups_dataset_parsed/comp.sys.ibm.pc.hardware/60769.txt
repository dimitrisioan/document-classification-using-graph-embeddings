OLD
KEYBOARDS
NEVER
DIE
HELLO
IAM
ALMOST
ASHAME
TO
ASK
THIS
QUESTION
IT
REALLY
LOOKS
LIKE
A
FAQ
BUT
COULDNT
FIND
THE
ANSWER
ANYWAY
THE
ORIGINAL
IBMPCXT
OR
KEY
KEYBOARD
IS
IN
MY
OPINION
STILL
THE
BEST
KEYBOARD
AROUND
FUNCTION
KEYS
ON
THE
RIGHT
PLACE
EH
LEFT
PLACE
FIRM
CLICK
ETC
IS
THERE
ANY
CHANCE
TO
CONNECT
ONE
OF
THESE
TO
A
MODERN
AT
CLONE
I
DO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
NEW
AT
KEYBOARD
HAS
MORE
FUNCTIONALITY
IE
THE
TYPEMATIC
REPEAT
RATE
IS
PROGRAMMABLE
ETC
IT
SEAMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
PINS
ELECTRICAL
SPECS
OF
THE
OLD
AND
THE
NEW
KEYBOARD
ARE
HOWEVER
THE
SAME
MAYBE
THE
COMMUNICATION
PROTOCOL
IS
DIFFERENT
PLEASE
ANSWER
BY
EMAIL
ALSO
IF
YOU
CAN
TELL
ME
THAT
IS
ABSOLUTELY
IMPOSSIBLE
IN
THAT
CASE
I
WILL
BRING
THE
KEYBOARD
THE
MUSEUM
OF
OBSOLETE
TECHNOLOGY
