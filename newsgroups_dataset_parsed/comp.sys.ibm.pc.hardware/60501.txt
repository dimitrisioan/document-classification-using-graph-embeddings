to
sum
up
when
an
accelerated
board
with
vram
true
colour
and
a
fast
vga
side
is
available
under
i
will
buy
one
me
too
whats
funny
is
when
we
really
can
buy
such
a
product
it
probably
wont
seem
as
mouthwatering
as
it
does
today
what
no
holograms
get
outta
here
i
can
wait
cos
ive
already
got
an
accelerated
card
it
does
but
only
colour
you
may
mock
me
but
such
cards
will
be
here
quickly
enough
one
of
the
odd
things
about
the
computer
industry
is
that
since
you
can
always
wait
and
get
something
better
some
people
wait
forever
i
know
people
who
have
deferred
updating
their
original
ibm
pc
for
a
decade
because
every
time
they
look
at
whats
available
they
see
something
better
coming
down
the
road
i
know
people
whove
dumped
their
pcs
into
the
garage
but
havent
replaced
them
because
theyre
afraid
it
isnt
the
right
time
to
buy
they
just
gave
up
using
computers
i
only
wait
when
the
difference
between
my
current
system
and
the
new
stuff
is
big
enough
to
warrant
changing
for
instance
ill
be
upgrading
my
to
a
eisa
vlb
board
rsn
the
performance
difference
under
linux
is
great
enough
to
be
worthwhile
at
the
same
time
ill
be
buying
a
new
graphic
card
and
new
scsi
controller
ill
be
buying
an
card
cos
theyre
fast
enough
i
have
drivers
for
them
and
itll
have
vram
just
like
a
weitek
card
it
will
also
be
much
cheaper
when
affordable
cards
arrive
ill
buy
one
personally
my
system
at
home
needs
a
new
disk
subsystem
a
much
larger
monitor
a
superfast
graphics
board
by
youknowwho
a
new
cpu
board
i
probably
wont
keep
much
more
than
the
case
and
the
mouse
come
to
think
of
it
i
dont
like
that
mouse
very
much
so
when
will
i
buy
when
my
dream
products
hit
the
market
no
way
im
gonna
buy
as
soon
as
i
have
the
money
over
the
last
year
ive
done
much
the
same
but
now
i
need
a
monitor
more
memory
just
aint
enough
a
gb
disk
and
no
space
left
oh
well
stay
single
dont
smoke
and
you
may
afford
it
this
year
