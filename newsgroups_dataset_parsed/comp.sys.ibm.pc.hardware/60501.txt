BETTER
SOME
PEOPLE
WAIT
FOREVER

PEOPLE

DEFERRED

PC

A
DECADE

SOMETHING
BETTER
COMING
DOWN
THE
ROAD
I
KNOW
PEOPLE
WHOVE
DUMPED
THEIR
PCS

THE
GARAGE

HAVENT
REPLACED
THEM
BECAUSE
THEYRE
AFRAID
IT
ISNT
THE
RIGHT
TIME

USING
COMPUTERS
I
ONLY
WAIT
WHEN
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
MY
CURRENT

BIG
ENOUGH
TO
WARRANT
CHANGING
FOR
INSTANCE

UPGRADING
MY

A
EISA
VLB
BOARD

PERFORMANCE
DIFFERENCE
UNDER

GRAPHIC
CARD

SCSI
