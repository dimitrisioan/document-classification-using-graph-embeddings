volante
warp
board
ive
been
troubleshooting
the
existence
of
way
too
many
general
protection
faults
on
a
eisavlb
system
at
this
point
i
think
ive
narrowed
the
problem
down
to
the
video
drivers
for
the
volante
adapter
by
national
design
inc
yet
somehow
i
find
this
hard
to
believe
does
anyone
else
have
any
experiences
with
this
board
thanx
