JUST
POKE
OUT
THE
LITTLE
PINS
IN
THE
CONNECTOR
AND
THEN
REPLACE
THEM
IN
THE
CORRECT
SLOTS
IS
THIS
REVERISIBLE
YOU
CAN
UNPOKE
AS
EASY
AS
YOU
POKE
WELL
I
TRIED
THIS
METHOD
BASED
ON
RESPONSES
FROM
SEVERAL
PEOPLE
EITHER
I
AM
A
KLUTZPROBABLE
OR
THEY
HAVE
CHANGED
THE
CONNECTOR
I
ENDED
UP
HAVING
TO
DESTROY
THE
CONNECTOR
PUT
HEAT
SHRINK
TUBING
ON
THE
INDIVIDUAL
PINS
AND
THEN
PLUG
THEM
INTO
THE
SB
CONNECTOR
IN
THE
CORRECT
ORDER
IT
WORKS
GREAT
THIS
WAY
SO
THIS
TURNED
OUT
JUST
FINE
IT
CERTAINLY
SOUNDED
EASY
BASED
ON
OTHER
PEOPLES
EXPERIENCES
BUT
MY
ATTEMPTS
DID
NOT
GO
TOO
WELL
