since
the
mac
uses
only
for
hard
drives
yes
the
figure
includes
a
hundred
for
scsi
drivers
this
is
sloppy
people
and
dumb
what
group
is
this
this
is
not
a
mac
group
ok
once
again
with
the
scsi
spec
list
why
the
spec
list
again
we
are
talking
scsi
on
a
pc
not
on
a
mac
or
a
unix
box
and
we
are
talking
isa
bus
or
possibly
eisa
or
vlb
this
isint
compperiphsscsi
tell
me
what
the
performance
figures
are
with
a
single
scsi
drive
on
a
pc
with
an
isa
or
eisa
or
vlb
bus
theoretical
performance
figures
are
not
relevant
to
this
group
or
this
debate
im
sure
that
there
are
some
platforms
out
there
that
can
handle
the
megssec
of
scsi
xyz
widenfast
but
the
pc
isint
one
of
them
if
we
are
to
continue
this
thread
state
clearly
which
scsi
you
are
talking
about
or
or
scsi
over
all
and
it
does
make
a
difference
well
maybe
if
the
scsi
design
people
had
their
act
together
than
maybe
all
pcs
would
have
built
in
scsi
ports
by
now
