THE
RECENT

HAVE
ALL
SHOWN
THAT
THE

THEY
LOOKED
AT
ARE
SIGNIFICANTLY
SLOWER
DOING
VGA

RECALL
THE
BIG
QUESTION
FOR
ME
IS

OF
THE

TESTED
SO

HAS
HAD
THE

DO
VGA
ORCHID

THE
ONLY
ONE
I
KNOW
ABOUT
I
DONT
KNOW
ABOUT
AMI
THAT
USES
THE
FOR
VGA
THAT
IS
REPORTEDLY
FASTER
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
WHETHER
THE
ORCHID
CARD
CAN
DO
VGA
AS
FAST
AS
THE
ATI
CARD
IF
SO
IT
WOULD
APPEAR
TO
BE
A
FORMIDABLE
COMPETITOR
ADVERTISED
