hi
there
we
just
bought
a
gateway
system
with
a
meg
ati
ultra
pro
video
card
everything
seems
to
work
fine
except
for
the
windows
drivers
for
bit
and
and
bit
modes
the
fonts
and
icons
start
deteriorating
after
windows
startup
and
within
minutes
of
use
everything
on
the
screen
is
totally
unintelligible
naturally
i
called
gateway
tech
support
to
inquire
about
this
the
technician
asked
me
about
the
drivers
and
i
told
him
it
was
version
build
he
told
me
that
the
and
bit
drivers
for
this
is
pure
bull
ive
had
the
bit
mode
and
working
since
the
version
before
bld
added
the
bit
option
to
flexpanel
try
getting
the
drivers
from
ftpcicaindianaedu
or
wuarchive
the
ati
ultra
pro
simply
do
not
work
is
this
true
if
so
im
simply
amazed
how
could
this
be
the
strange
thing
is
i
would
have
expected
to
see
some
discussion
on
here
unless
the
