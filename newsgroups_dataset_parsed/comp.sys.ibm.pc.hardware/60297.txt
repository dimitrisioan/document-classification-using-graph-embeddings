scsi
is
better
because
it
has
a
better
future
and
it
has
a
lot
of
minor
advantages
right
now
ide
cards
are
cheaper
right
now
but
will
be
obsolete
in
a
few
years
in
fact
ide
cards
are
so
cheap
they
might
as
well
be
free
the
real
cost
is
in
the
ide
drives
scsi
cards
cost
more
but
they
are
worth
it
i
almost
got
a
hernia
laughing
at
this
one
youll
probably
get
one
when
you
realize
that
your
vesa
super
dooper
local
bus
ultra
high
tech
controller
sucks
if
anything
scsi
on
a
pc
will
be
obsolete
killed
off
by
vesa
local
with
any
luck
pc
bus
archeitecture
will
be
doen
any
with
by
sbus
have
you
ever
seen
what
happens
when
you
hook
a
busmaster
controller
to
a
vesa
local
bus
it
actually
slows
down
your
system
bus
ide
it
must
be
real
nice
to
get
shafted
by
bucks
for
the
extra
cost
of
a
scsi
drive
then
pay
another
for
a
scsi
controller
maybe
my
workstation
doesnt
understand
what
your
vesa
local
bus
ide
is
vesa
local
bus
will
be
killed
off
by
pcmi
whatever
intels
spec
is
vlbus
it
not
good
for
much
more
than
vga
cards
to
each
his
own
ill
laugh
when
you
start
crying
over
how
much
you
spent
for
your
little
ide
drives
and
then
finding
out
you
need
more
space
the
biggest
advantage
of
scsi
right
now
is
that
you
can
add
more
different
kinds
of
devices
such
as
tapes
etc
easily
and
can
add
bigger
disks
the
best
and
most
cost
effective
hard
disks
available
are
scsi
here
here
only
of
you
need
drives
larger
then
meg
oh
yes
gotta
have
megssec
transfer
rate
for
those
speedy
tape
backups
and
cd
rom
drives
dont
stick
your
foot
in
your
mouth
when
you
make
a
statement
you
know
nothing
about
id
rather
wait
a
second
compared
to
the
minutes
and
ide
would
take
obviously
exaggerated
have
you
ever
tried
to
backup
gigs
of
disk
oh
i
forgot
you
cant
because
you
have
an
ide
and
no
one
makes
ide
disks
that
big
basically
if
a
person
has
to
ask
which
one
is
better
for
himher
then
they
will
probably
never
see
the
expensive
benefits
from
scsi
i
guess
you
probably
bought
a
too
also
all
this
armwaving
about
scsi
expandability
is
a
moot
point
if
the
user
only
has
one
or
two
drives
on
it
and
with
scsi
those
two
drives
may
be
fast
but
that
speed
is
only
due
to
the
onboard
memory
cache
something
i
can
duplicate
with
a
caching
ide
controller
what
the
fastwide
spec
has
much
more
bandwidth
than
any
stupid
vlbus
ide
crap
stop
this
thread
now
its
just
cluttering
up
bandwidth
if
you
want
to
read
about
scsi
vs
ide
just
pay
a
visit
to
you
local
usenet
archive
the
best
fastwideetc
is
clearly
faster
than
any
the
best
ide
drive
all
the
response
given
are
based
upon
personal
experience
with
or
drives
you
cant
judge
such
completely
different
interfaces
ide
has
the
low
cost
adavantage
a
descent
performance
scsi
has
the
ability
for
super
high
capacity
expandibility
and
speed
neither
one
is
better
in
all
cases
if
you
dont
belive
what
i
said
about
busmastering
and
vlbus
then
pick
up
a
back
issue
of
pcweek
in
whihc
they
tested
