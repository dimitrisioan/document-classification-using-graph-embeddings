horrer
stories
about
the
dos
thats
of
the
people
i
know
with
dos
both
have
had
to
reformat
their
disks
and
start
over
one

drive
d
compress
and
work
fine
only
to
compress
c
to
have
the
thing
choke

out
an
unintelligable
warning
and
then
hang
all
that
was
left
on
either
drive

autoexecbat
and
configsys
calls
to
microsoft
only
met
with
busy
signals
after
reformatting
the
drive
im
not
sure
if
he
had
the
guts
to
reinstall
or
stay
with
a
known
entity
the
other
may
have
been
a
marginal
drive
however
his
upgrade
failed
he
had
to
format
a
floppy
disk
at
format
the
drive
and
then
reinstall
i
make
now
claims
since
i
was
not
driving
at
the
time
however
be
careful
and
make
sure
you

important
things
up

am
interested
in
any
other
