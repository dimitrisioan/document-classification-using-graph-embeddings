do
all
scsi
cards
for
dos
systems
require
a
separate
device
driver
to
be
loaded
into
memory
for
each
scsi
device
hooked
up
no
all
that
ive
seen
have
also
an
onboard
bios
which
enables
you
to
use
up
to
hard
drives
directly
under
dos
drives
is
a
dos
limitation
and
you
have
the
same
problem
with
ide
and
all
other
standards
for
that
matter
software
drivers
often
allow
for
better
performance
though
you
have
to
use
them
if
you
want
to
use
other
devices
besides
hard
disks
or
have
more
than
disks
no
the
always
among
others
requires
no
drivers
for
up
to
scsi
hard
drives
dos
does
not
have
a
drive
maximum
as
i
already
have
all
is
done
in
hardware
theres
no
software
drivers
at
all
