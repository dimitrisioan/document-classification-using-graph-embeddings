hard
disk
utilities
hi
to
all
you
pc
gurus
im
new
to
these
groups
and
so
please
forgive
me
if
my
questions
are
frequently
asked
but
i
dont
know
the
answer
ive
been
recently
having
some
problems
with
my
computer
with
a
seagate
meg
hard
drive
i
occasionally
find
corrupted
files
but
most
of
the
time
programs
work
fine
are
there
any
utilities
that
are
easily
available
that
can
help
me
determine
whether
or
not
the
problem
is
a
result
of
the
hard
drive
vs
an
illbehaved
program
or
some
other
hardware
item
are
there
utilites
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
hard
drive
is
properly
aligned
etc
as
might
be
expected
i
would
greatly
appreciate
any
help
on
this
matter
im
considering
just
reformatting
the
disk
and
reinstalling
everything
and
hoping
that
will
fix
the
problem
but
i
would
like
to
have
some
assurance
of
what
the
problem
cause
is
also
can
someone
give
me
an
opinion
on
dos
are
the
compression
and
defragmentation
routines
good
enough
to
consider
the
upgrade
if
i
dont
have
those
routines
already
as
opposed
to
buying
them
separately
much
thanks
in
advance
for
any
help
