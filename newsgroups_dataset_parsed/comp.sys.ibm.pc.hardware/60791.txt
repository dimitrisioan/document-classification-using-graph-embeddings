HELLO
I
HAVE
PROBLEMS
COMBINING
TWO
IDE
HARD
DISKS
SEAGATE
AND
QUANTUM
AS
SINGLE
HARD
DISK
BOTH
ARE
WORKING
FINE
BUT
CONNECTING
THEM
TOGETHER
TO
MY
CONTROLLER
DOESNT
WORK
MY
QUESTIONS
ARE
HAS
ANYBODY
OUT
THERE
EVER
BEEN
SUCCESFUL
USING
SUCH
HARD
DISKS
TOGETHER
AND
IF
SO
WHAT
JUMPER
SETTINGS
AND
BIOS
SETTTING
DID
HESHE
USE
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
THAT
MY
CONTROLLER
IS
THE
REASON
FOR
MY
TROUBLES
THE
ONLY
THING
I
KNOW
ABOUT
IT
IS
THAT
IT
IS
AN
IDEHARDDISKCONTROLLER
HOW
MANY
HARDDISKS
CAN
SUCH
A
CONTROLLER
CONTROL
IN
MY
CASE
ONLY
ONE
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
VOLKER
IDE
DRIVES
HAVE
JUMPERS
ON
THEM
TO
INDICATE
IF
IT
IS
A
MASTER
OR
A
SLAVE
IF
IT
IS
A
MASTER
THEN
A
SECOND
JUMPER
INDICATES
IF
A
SLAVE
IS
PRESENT
THESE
MUST
BE
SET
CORRECTLY
ACCORDING
TO
EACH
DRIVES
MANUFACTURERS
SPEC
IFICATION
THE
CMOS
SETUP
IS
ALMOST
POSITIVELY
NOT
THE
PROBLEM
IT
IS
PROBABLY
NOT
THE
CONTROLLER
IDE
CONTROLLERS
ALL
SUPPORT
EXACTLY
TWO
DRIVES
