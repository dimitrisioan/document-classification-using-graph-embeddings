was
having
some
problems
in
his
immediate
family
and
had
delayed
the
continuation
of
development
for
a
time
this
was
some
months
ago
its
a
shame

driver
is
the
best
memory
manager
i
have
found
anywhere
it
doesnt
require
mode
like
qemm
so
it
works
with

doesnt
take
any
memory
runs
then
exits
if

the
emm
provider
were
a
little
faster

more
stable
