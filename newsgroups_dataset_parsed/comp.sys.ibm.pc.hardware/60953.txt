ARTICLE
MAX
BRANTE
W
HAVE
ANYBODY
SUCCEDED
IN
CONVERTING
A
ATARI
MONOMCHROME
MONITOR
INTO
A
MONO
VGA
MONITOR
IF
SO
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
EXACTLY
HOW
YOU
DID
AND
WHAT
GRAPHICS
CARD
YOU
USED
I
WISH
I
COULD
HELP
I
POSTED
A
SIMILAR
QUESTION
ABOUT
TWO
WEEKS
AGO
I
GOT
NO
RESPONSE
AT
ALL
IVE
ASKED
LOCALLY
AT
MY
FRIENDLY
ATARI
STORE
I
WAS
TOLD
THAT
IT
SHOULD
BE
POSSIBLE
BUT
THAT
THEY
HAD
NO
IDEA
HOW
IT
MIGHT
BE
DONE
NOR
DID
THEY
PARTICULARLY
CARE
TO
INVESTIGATE
OK
HERES
MY
RESULTS
SO
FAR
YOU
HAVE
TO
DEFINE
THE
MONITOR
AS
LCD
IT
DOESNT
REALLY
SUPPORT
ANALOGUE
VIDEO
INPUT
IT
WORKS
BUT
ISNT
VERY
LINEAR
THE
INCOMING
SYNC
PULSES
NEED
INVERTING
THIS
IS
BEST
ACHIEVED
WITH
EITHER
A
CMOS
XOR
PACKAGE
OR
A
TRANSISTOR
INVERTER
IF
YOU
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
DO
IT
DONT
EVEN
CONTEMPLATE
IT
ITLL
ONLY
WORK
IN
STANDARD
VGA
MODE
OK
HAVING
SAID
THAT
IM
TRYING
TO
EITHER
FIND
A
CIRCUIT
OR
IC
WHICH
WILL
ACT
AS
A
UNIVERSAL
SYNC
DECODER
I
WANT
SOMETHIKNG
WHICH
BASICALLY
ONLY
DETECTS
THE
LEADING
SYNC
PULSE
EDGE
AND
DOESNT
CARE
ABOUT
THE
POLARITY
OUTPUTTING
THE
VE
GOING
PULSES
THAT
THE
ATARI
MONITOR
REQUIRES
THERE
ARE
REASONS
FOR
DOING
THIS
VGA
CARDS
CHANGE
THEIR
SYNC
POLARITY
DEPENDING
WHICH
MODE
THEYRE
IN
HERC
EMULATION
IS
WHILE
MVGA
IS
FOR
EXAMPLE
IT
MEANS
I
DONT
HAVE
TO
PUT
A
TOGGLE
SWITCH
ON
THE
BACK
OF
THE
MONITOR
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
ABLE
TO
RUN
IT
OFF
BOTH
THE
ATARI
AND
MY
IBM
CURRENTLY
I
HAVE
YES
MONITORS
SITTING
ON
MY
DESK
AND
I
WANT
TO
GET
THAT
NUMBER
DOWN
AS
MUCH
AS
POSSIBLE
BEING
ABLE
TO
USE
THE
ATARI
MONITOR
AS
A
PAPERWHITE
VGA
WILL
CUT
THINGS
DOWN
TO
IF
I
FORGET
ABOUT
ATARI
COLOUR
I
CAN
GET
DOWN
TO
ULTIMATELY
THE
BEST
COURSE
OF
ACTION
IS
TO
GET
A
MULTISYNC
MONITOR
BUT
IM
AS
PRESSED
FOR
CASH
AS
ANYONE
ELSE
SO
ITLL
HAVE
TO
WAIT
