ORCHID
VS
FAHRENHEIT
MINI
REVIEW
I
JUST
PURCHASED
A
VIEWSONIC
AND
AND
ORCHID
IN
SHORT
I
AM
HAPPY
WITH
THE
MONITOR
AND
UNHAPPY
WITH
THE
CARD
I
HAVE
SPENT
A
LOT
MORE
TIME
FUTZING
WITH
THE
CARD
SO
THAT
IS
WHAT
I
AM
GOING
TO
WRITE
ABOUT
THE
MONITOR
IS
PRETTY
THE
MOIRES
I
HAD
UNDER
SIMCITY
ON
MY
MAGNAVOX
WENT
AWAY
IT
ISNT
AS
HEAVY
AS
I
THOUGHT
IT
WOULD
BE
LBS
I
THINK
SO
MUCH
FOR
THE
MONITOR
ON
TO
THE
BITCH
SESSION
AND
TEST
RESULTS
IN
GOING
WITH
THE
MODERN
TREND
THE
ORCHID
CARD
ONLY
SUPPORTS
COLORS
IN
MODE
WITHOUT
A
DRIVER
OF
COURSE
THIS
BREAKS
ANY
DOS
PROGRAM
WHICH
USES
SVGA
MODES
LIKE
MOST
OF
MY
CDROMS
THE
COMPUDYNE
WHIPLASH
VGA
ORCHID
FAHRENHEIT
AND
ORCHID
F
VLB
ALL
SHARE
THIS
LIMITATION
THOSE
ARE
ALL
CARDS
WHICH
MEANS
IT
IS
AN
PROBLEM
FOR
THEM
THE
USES
A
WEITEK
VGA
CHIP
WHICH
ALSO
DOESNT
SUPPORT
THEM
THE
HERCULES
GRAPHITE
CARD
DOES
SEEM
TO
HAVE
THESE
MODES
BUT
I
DIDNT
RUN
THE
SAME
TEST
CASES
AS
I
DID
ON
THE
OTHER
BOARDS
DURING
THE
BRIEF
TIME
I
HAD
IT
IT
WAS
ABLE
TO
PRINT
THE
SPLASH
SCREEN
FOR
THE
GROLIERS
ENCYCLOPEDIA
THOUGH
WHICH
THE
CARDS
JUST
PRINTED
AS
HASH
WHICH
IS
WHY
I
SUSPECT
THE
SVGA
MODES
ARE
SUPPORTED
THE
SUPPORTED
RESOLUTIONS
REALLY
ANNOY
ME
YOU
CAN
DO
AT
IF
YOU
TELL
THE
DRIVER
YOU
HAVE
AN
NEC
THEY
ONLY
HAVE
ABOUT
SIX
MONITORS
LISTED
PLUS
GENERIC
AND
IF
YOU
CHOOSE
GENERIC
YOU
CANT
GET
ANY
HIGH
REFRESHES
AT
ALL
BUT
AT
YOU
ARE
LIMITED
TO
SEEMS
TO
ME
THAT
THE
HARDWARE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
SUPPORT
THE
BANDWIDTH
IF
IT
CAN
DO
AT
IT
SURE
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
DO
IT
AT
HIGHER
VERTICAL
RESOLUTION
WAS
THE
MAIN
REASON
I
BOUGHT
THE
CARD
OVER
THE
ORCHID
F
VLB
I
CURRENTLY
HAVE
AND
IT
WILL
DO
HZ
AS
WELL
THE
HIGHER

ALL

I
JUST
GOT
OFF
THE
PHONE
WITH
ORCHID
AND
WITH
THE
DRIVERS
I
DONT
KNOW
WHAT
I
HAVE
HE
WAS
UNABLE
TO
RECREATE
THE
PROBLEM
ON
THE
PLUS
SIDE
THEIR
TECH
REP
WAS
AS
HELPFUL
AS
HE
COULD
BE
AND
BOOTED
UP
THE
PROGRAM
ON
HIS
COMPUTER
TO
VERIFY
HE
DIDNT
HAVE
THE
PROBLEM
HE
DIDNT
KNOW
WHY
THEY
LIMITED
THE
REFRESH
TO
HZ
EITHER
THE
BOARD
IS
FASTER
THAT
THE
OFVLB
FOR
MOST
THINGS
ACCORDING
TO
THE
HERCULES
SPEEDY
PROGRAM
THIS
PROGRAM
TESTS
VARIOUS
OPERATIONS
AND
REPORTS
THE
RESULTS
IN
PIXELSSECOND
I
DONT
HAVE
THE
NUMBERS
FOR
THE
GRAPHITE
CARD
BUT
THEY
WERE
CLOSE
TO
HALF
OF
THE
OFVLB
IE
SLOWER
BUT
THAT
WAS
RUNNING
IN
A
ISA
SO
THE
NUMBERS
ARENT
REALLY
COMPARABLE
THE
FOLLOWING
NUMBERS
WERE
ALL
OBTAINED
USING
A
MHZ
AIR
MOTHERBOARD
UMC
CHIPSET
WITH
MB
MEMORY
I
GIVE
RANGES
BECAUSE
THE
PROGRAM
REPORTS
THE
NUMBERS
AS
IT
COMPUTES
THEM
AND
THESE
TEND
TO
JUMP
AROUND
A
BIT
K
MEANS
THOUSAND
NOT
M
MEANS

SLOWLY

INCREASES
DRAMATICALLY
SOUNDS

TO

I
MAKE
NO
CLAIMS
THAT
THESE

MEAN

ITS
JUST

I

WHEN
I
RAN

I
NORMALLY
DONT

MAYBE
