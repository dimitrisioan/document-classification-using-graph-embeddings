HELLO
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
FOR
ANYONE
THAT
MAY
BE
FAMILIAR
WITH
ISA
AND
EISA
SYTEM
CONFIGURATIONS
AFTER
I
SWITCH
THE
ISA
BOARDS
INTO
THE
EISA
BOARD
ALL
OF
THE
CARDS
ARE
ISA
THE
SYSTEM
SEEMS
TO
WORK
WITH
NO
PROBLEM
WHAT
SO
EVER
BUT
SOME
OF
THE
INTERUPT
PROBLEMS
THAT
WE
HAD
WITH
THE
ISA
BOARD
CONTINUE
WITH
THE
EISA
BOARD
IS
IT
MY
UNDERSTANDING
THAT
THE
EISA
BOARD
SHOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
HANDLE
IRQ
CONFICTS
WHEN
RUNNING
WINDOWS
PROBLEM
WHEN
RUNNING
OUR
NETWORK
VIA
TELNET
TCPIP
WITH
WINDOWS
RUNNING
THE
SYSTEM
KICKS
US
OUT
OF
WINDOWS
IRQ
CONFICT
WITHIN
WINDOWS
I
ASSUME
ALSO
ARE
THERE
ANY
MEMORY
ADDRESS
PROBLEMS
THAT
WILL
HAPPEN
WHEN
THE
BOARDS
ARE
SWITCHED
BASE
MEMORY
THAT
IS
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
IF
YOU
ARE
USING
EISA
MOTHER
BOARD
YOU
HAVE
TO
USE
ALSO
EISA
CARDS
OR
ELSE
YOUR
COMPUTER
SYSTEM
WILL
BE
SLOWER
THAN
WHEN
YOURE
USING
ISA
BOARD
WITH
ISA
CARDS
BILL
THATS
NONSENSE
YOU
CAN
USE
ISA
CARDS
IN
AN
EISASYSTEM
WITHOUT
PROBLEM
AND
AT
THE
SAME
SPEED
AS
IN
AN
ISA
SYSTEM
LUKE
