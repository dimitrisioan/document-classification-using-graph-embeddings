floptical
drives
anyone
just
curious
why
floptical
drives
never
seemed
to
catch
on
remember
those
mb
disks
that
look
and
feel
like
floppies
these
drives
are
scsi
devices
and
can
read
and
write
both
kb
and
mb
disks
sounds
to
me
to
be
one
great
product
for
the
pc
market
are
the
prices
really
that
unaffordable
compared
to
cdroms
which
are
currently
not
rewritable
i
know
about
the
new
rewritable
cds
and
expect
sony
to
develop
the
first
mds
for
the
computer
my
question
is
why
isnt
there
any
substantial
interest
in
developing
the
flopticals
just
a
thought
