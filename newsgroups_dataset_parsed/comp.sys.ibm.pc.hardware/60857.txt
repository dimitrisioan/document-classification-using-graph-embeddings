hi
does
anyone
have
a
source
for
motherboards
ive
been
calling
around
the
local
stores
and
everyone
appears
to
be
only
stocking
the
or
motherboards
how
difficult
is
it
to
modify
a
motherboard
to
run
at
mhz
is
it
as
simple
as
replacing
the
system
clock
with
a
slower
part
thanks

suspect
a

here
are
you
trying

drag
intel

or
something
i
really
wish
you
guys
would
make
your
own
computers
faster
instead
of
degrading
others
why
dont
you
go
straight
for
the
top
and
run
a
pentium
at
mhz
while
youre
at
it
seriously
though
why
in
the
bleeding
hell
do
you
want
a
to
run
at
