a
computer
with
a
mg
seagate
ide
drive
and
a
controler
built
into
the
motherboard
i
want
to
add
a
scsi
drive
a
quantum
prodrive
mg
formatted
i
have
no
documentation
at
all
and
i
need
your
help
as
i
understand
it
here
is
the
process
of
adding
such
a
drive
could
you
please
tell
me
if
im
right
buy
a
scsi
contoler
which
one
i
know
adaptec
is
good
but
they
are
kind
of
expensive
are
there
any
good
boards
in
the
region
i
want
it
to
be
compatible
with
and
unix
if
possible
also
i
have
seen
on
the
net
that
there
are
scsi
and
drives
is
this
true
does
the
adapter
need
to
be
the
same
as
the
drive
what
type
of
drive
is
the
quantum
i
have
tried
others
but
i
think
that
the
adaptec
is
best
value
for
money
connect
the
drive
to
the
adapter
via
a
scsi
cable
and
the
power
cable
do
i
have
to
worry
about
the
power
supply
i
think
i
have
watts
and
all
im
powering
are
two
floppies
and
the
seagate
drive
i
dont
think
you
can
mix
the
two
types
of
drive
unless
you
have
one
of
the
scsiide
cards
that
is
available
you
will
have
to
turn
your
ide
off
setup
the
bios
to
recognize
the
drive
as
the
second
drive
what
type
of
drive
is
this
i
dont
have
the
numbers
for
this
drive
instructions
for
drive
type
are
included
with
the
controller
with
some
it
may
be
a
type
no
matter
what
the
disk
is
with
others
it
may
be
a
type
i
had
one
controller
that
i
had
to
tell
the
bios
that
no
hard
disk
was
installed
format
and
create
partitions
on
the
drive
do
i
use
format
or
fdisk
i
think
that
ide
drives
cant
be
lowlevel
formatted
is
it
the
same
with
scsi
how
exactly
does
fdisk
work
i
have
a
reduced
msdos
manual
clone
obliges
and
there
is
no
mention
of
fdisk
ideally
i
would
want
the
drive
partitioned
in
to
two
partitions
d
and
e
how
do
i
do
this
do
not
low
level
format
a
scsi
unless
you
have
the
scsi
low
level
format
program
first
use
fdisk
to
set
the
partitions
then
use
format
well
that
seems
to
be
all
is
there
anythiing
im
forgetting
any
help
is
really
appreciated
im
lost
