what
video
board
for
my
system
id
appreciate
any
advice
about
a
video
card
for
my
system
dx
mb
of
ram
on
a
novell
network
monitor
nec
capable
of
hz
vertical
refresh
rate
major
considerations
i
expect
i
will
work
mostly
in
windows
but
with
some
dos
applications
and
i
would
want
decent
speed
in
dos
i
do
mostly
word
processing
database
and
communicationsnot
much
intensive
graphics
with
a
monitor
i
expect
i
will
work
mostly
in
and
colors
seems
plenty
but
id
like
like
the
image
to
be
sharp
fast
and
rock
solid
other
considerations
i
sometimes
run
a
unix
clone
coherent
and
i
understand
that
some
companies
eg
diamond
dont
encourage
the
thirdparty
development
of
drivers
i
might
move
to
if
i
decide
i
need
better
speed
and
reliability
than
i
get
with
windows
for
my
database
work
and
multitasking
i
dont
have
a
local
bus
motherboardim
not
sure
how
much
to
invest
in
an
isa
video
board
versus
getting
something
less
expensive
now
and
upgrading
to
local
bus
later
i
like
buying
things
from
companies
that
treat
their
customers
well
if
you
have
any
advice
for
me
id
love
to
hear
it
via
email
or
post
thanks
