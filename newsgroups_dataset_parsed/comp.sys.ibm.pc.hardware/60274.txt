APRIL
ALTHOUGH
SCSI
IS
TWICE
AS
FASST
AS
ESDI
FASTER
THAN
IDE
AND
SUPPORT
UP
TO
DEVICES
ITS
ACCEPTANCE
HAS
LONG
BEEN
STALLED
BY
INCOMPATABILITY
PROBLEMS
AND
INSTALLATION
HEADACHES
NOTE
WHAT
IT
DOES
NOT
SITE
AS
A
FACTOR
PRICE
THERE
IS
A
PREMIUM
OF
APPROX
FOR
THE
CONTROLLER
WHAT
IS
NICE
IS
BEING
ABLE
TO
RUN
HARD

TAPE
DRIVES
CDROMS
AND
SCANNERS
OF
ONE
DMA
CHANNEL
AND
INTERUPT

MAKES

IS
YOU
ARE
GOING
TO
LOAD

USES
SCSI

RUN
UNIX

RUNS
DOSWINDOWS

GET
PLUG
AND
PLAY
ONLY
SINCE
