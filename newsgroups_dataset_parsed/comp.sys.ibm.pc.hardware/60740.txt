RE
DATE
IS
STUCK
IN
ARTICLE
JOHN
BONGIOVANNI
WRITES
STUFF
DELETED
DID
I
ONCE
HEAR
THAT
IN
ORDER
FOR
THE
DATE
TO
ADVANCE
SOMETHING
LIKE
A
CLOCK
HAS
TO
MAKE
A
GET
DATE
SYSTEM
CALL
APPARENTLY
THE
CLOCK
HARDWARE
INTERRUPT
AND
BIOS
DONT
DO
THIS
DATE
ADVANCE
AUTOMATICALLY
THE
GET
DATE
CALL
NOTICES
THAT
A
MIDNIGHT
RESET
FLAG
HAS
BEEN
SET
AND
THEN
THEN
ADVANCES
THE
DATE
ANYBODY
WITH
MORE
INFO
THERE
ARE
TWO
PROBLEMS
THE
BIOS
TOD
ROUTINE
WHICH
UPDATES
THE
BIOS
CLOCK
USES
ONLY
BIT
FOR
DAY
INCREMENT
SO
A
SECOND
WRAPPING
OF
THE
CLOCK
PAST
MIDNIGHT
WILL
GET
LOST
IF
NO
ONE
CALLS
THE
BIOS
TO
READ
THE
CLOCK
IN
THE
MEANTIME
AND
THE
BIOS
RESETS
THE
DAY
WRAP
INDICATOR
ON
THE
FIRST
GET
DATE
CALL
FROM
ANYBODY
AFTER
THE
WRAP
INDICATOR
HAS
BEEN
SET
SO
UNLESS
THE
FIRST
BIOS
GET
DATE
CALL
AFTER
MIDNIGHT
IS
DONE
BY
THE
DOS
KERNEL
WHICH
IS
THE
ONLY
PART
OF
DOS
WHICH
KNOWS
HOW
TO
INCREMENT
THE
DATE
THE
DAY
WRAP
INDICATION
IS
NORMALLY
LOST
MY
GUESS
IS
THAT
KEVINS
MENU
SYSTEM
USES
BIOS
CALLS
TO
READ
THE
CLOCK
IN
ORDER
TO
DISPLAY
THE
TIME
AND
IS
HENCE
THE
ENTITY
WHICH
CAUSES
THE
DAY
WRAP
INDICATION
TO
GET
LOST
EVEN
IF
THE
MENU
SYSTEM
NOTICES
THE
DAY
WRAP
WHICH
I
THINK
IS
INDICATED
BY
A
NONZERO
VALUE
IN
AL
THERE
REALLY
ISNT
ANY
PARTICULARLY
GOOD
WAY
TO
TELL
DOS
ABOUT
IT
SO
THAT
DOS
CAN
UPDATE
THE
DAY
THE
MENU
SYSTEM
SHOULD
USE
DOS
CALLS
TO
GET
THE
TIME
WHICH
WOULD
CAUSE
THE
DOS
KERNEL
TO
DO
THE
BIOS
CALL
AND
THE
WRAP
INDICATOR
WOULD
HENCE
BE
PROCESSED
PROPERLY
POSSIBLY
THOUGH
THE
MENU
SYSTEM
CANT
EASILY
USE
DOS
CALLS
FOR
TIME
BECAUSE
DOS
IS
NOT
REENTRANT
AND
PERHAPS
TIME
INCREMENTING
OFTERS
OCCUR
WHILE
THE
MENU
SYSTEM
IS
INSIDE
SOME
OTHER
DOS
CALL
