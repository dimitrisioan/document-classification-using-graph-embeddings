THESE
DISK
CONTROLLER
ARE
CALL
DEVICES
THERE
ARE
DEVICES
THAT
REQUIRES
EXCLUSIVE
INTERRUPT
OWNERSHIP
EG
DISK
CONTROLLER
AND
KEYBOARD
THERE
ARE
ALSO
DEVICES
THAT
DOES
NOT
REQUIRE
EXCLUSIVE
OWNERSHIP
IE
IT
WILL
SHARE
AN
INTERRUPT
WITH
ANOTHER
DEVICE
EG
NO
IN
A
STANDARD
ISA
BUS
THE
ONE
THAT
ALMOST
ALL
NONLAPTOP
PCS
USE
TWO
SEPARATE
INTERFACE
CARDS
CANNOT
SHARE
AN
INTERRUPT
THIS
IS
DUE
TO
A
SCREWUP
IN
THE
BUS
DESIGN
FOR
EXAMPLE
IF
YOUR
SOUNDBLASTER
WANTS
TO
DRIVE
INTERRUPT
NUMBER
THEN
IT
MUST
HOLD
A
CERTAIN
BUS
WIRE
TO
OR
AT
ALL
TIMES
DEPENDING
ON
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
WANTS
AN
INTERRUPT
THIS
PRECLUDES
LETTING
ANOTHER
CARD
ASSERT
INTERRUPT
NUMBER
WHEN
TWO
OR
MORE
DEVICES
IN
AN
ISA
BUS
PC
SHARE
AN
INTERRUPT
ITS
BECAUSE
THEYRE
IMPLEMENTED
BY
A
SINGLE
CARD
INTERESTING
WOULD
YOU
CARE
TO
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
THEN
HOW
MY
SOUNDBLASTER
PRO
CARD
AND
MY
PRINTER
CARD
ARE
SHARING
IRQ
SUCCESSFULLY
I
ASSURE
YOU
THAT
THEY
ARE
BOTH
SET
TO
IRQ
AND
THAT
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
MY
COMPUTER
IS
A
DTK
IBM
CLONE
SIMPLE
FIRST
ANDREW
IS
CORRECT
ALTHOUGH
I
CAN
SEE
WHERE
THERE
MIGHT
BE
SOME
CONFUSION
IT
IS
INDEED
POSSIBLE
TO
HAVE
TWO
CARDS
CONFIGURED
TO
USE
THE
SAME
INTERRUPT
THEY
CAN
NOT
SHARE
THE
INTERRUPT
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
POSSIBLE
TO
HAVE
BOTH
CARDS
ACTIVE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
HERE
IS
AN
EXAMPLE
FOR
SOME
TIME
I
WAS
SHORT
OF
FREE
INTERRUPTS
I
HAD
A
TAPE
CONTROLLER
NOT
A
FLOPPY
TAPE
THAT
NEEDED
ONE
OF
ITS
AN
OLD
TAPE
DRIVE
MY
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
USE
ALSO
USED
FOR
WHERE
MY
MODEM
IS
I
DID
THIS
BECAUSE
I
REASONED
I
WOULD
NEVER
BE
USING
THE
MODEM
AND
THE
TAPE
SIMULTANEOUSLY
WHEN
KERMIT
RUNS
IT
INSTALLS
ITS
OWN
INTERRUPT
HANDLER
FOR
AND
USES
THE
SERIAL
PORT
IF
THE
TAPE
DRIVE
WERE
TO
GENERATE
AN
INTERRUPT
KERMIT
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
A
CLUE
WHAT
TO
DO
WITHFOR
THE
TAPE
CONTROLLER
AND
SINCE
THE
TAPE
CONTROLLER
WOULD
NOT
BE
SERVICED
IT
WOULD
MOST
LIKELY
HANG
LIKEWISE
WHEN
THE
TAPE
BACKUP
SOFTWARE
RUNS
IT
INSTALLS
AN
INTERRUPT
HANDLER
FOR
THAT
HANDLER
WONT
DO
ANYTHING
FOR
THE
SERIAL
PORT
UNDER
DOS
PRINTING
IS
NOT
INTERRUPTDRIVEN
INSTEAD
THE
BIOS
POLLS
THE
STATUS
OF
THE
PARALLEL
PORT
TO
DETERMINE
WHEN
ANOTHER
BYTE
MAY
BE
SENT
THATS
WHY
YOU
CAN
HAVE
YOUR
SOUND
CARD
AND
BOTH
CONFIGURED
TO
USE
