WRITES
I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
WESTERN
DIGITALCAVIAR
IDE
DRIVE
AND
I
WANT
TO
ADD
IT
TO
MY
SYSTEM
WHICH
ALREADY
HAS
A
IDE
DRIVE
THE
CONTROLLER
SAYS
IT
SUPPORTS
HARD
DRIVES
BUT
WHEN
I
PLUG
IN
THE
CABLES
DO
THE
BIOS
SETUP
AND
TRY
TO
START
THE
SYSTEM
IT
PAUSES
AND
THEN
I
GET
AN
INVALID
DRIVE
D
ERROR
MESSAGE
THE
SYSTEM
BOOTS
BUT
I
CANNOT
ACCESS
THE
NEW
HARD
DRIVE
THE
NEW
DRIVE
WORKS
FINE
AS
DRIVE
C
IF
ITS
ALL
ALONE
BUT
I
AM
NOT
ABLE
TO
GET
BOTH
DRIVES
WORKING
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
ANY
HELP
IS
APPRECIATED
THANKS
