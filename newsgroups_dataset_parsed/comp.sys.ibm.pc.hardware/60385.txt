CAN
ANYONE
TELL
ME
IF
THIS
CARD
WORKS
WITH
THE
MARCH
BETA
I
BELIEVE
SO
SINCE
THE
BUSLOGIC
CARDS
HAVE
PROVEN
TO
BE
VERY
RELIABLE
IN
THE
BUSLOGIC
CARDS
HAVE
AN
DRIVER
THAT
DOES
WORK
WITH
THE
MARCH
BETA
SUPPORT
FOR
THE
BUSLOGIC
CARDS
IS
NOT
INCLUDED
WITH
ANY
LONGER
IF
YOU
WISH
TO
INSTALL
THE
BETA
FROM
THE
CDROM
YOU
WILL
NEED
TO
REM
OUT
THE
ADAPTEC
DEVICE
DRIVERS
AS
THEY
HAVE
A
NASTY
TENDENCY
TO
CRASH
THE
BUSLOGIC
CARDS
WHEN
ATTEMPTS
TO
USE
THEM
THANKS
ADAPTEC
SO
YOU
ADD
THE
BUSLOGIC
DRIVERS
TO
THE
CONFIGSYS
ON
THE
CDROM
BOOT
DISK
AND
REM
OUT
THE
ADAPTEC
DRIVERS
THEN
YOU
INSTALL
THE
WHOLE
HALF
OF
THE
BETA
AND
IT
WONT
WORK
IBM
NICELY
COPIES
IN
THE
ADAPTEC
DRIVERS
ONCE
AGAIN
THANKS
IBM
SO
REM
OUT
THE
ADAPTEC
DRIVERS
ONCE
MORE
AND
REBOOT
IF
YOU
HAVE
EVERYTHING
IN
THE
RIGHT
ORDER
IT
WILL
WORK
THINGS
ARE
PRETTY
SMOOTH
THROUGH
THE
REST
OF
THE
INSTALLATION
EXCEPT
WILL
TRY
TO
INSTALL
THE
ADAPTEC
SCSI
DRIVERS
ONCE
AGAIN
AT
THE
END
SO
YOU
ARE
OFF
TO
MORE
REM
STATEMENTS
AND
MORE
FUN
THE
BT
COMES
WITH
DRIVERS
AND
COSTS
THE
SAME
AS
THE
ADAPTEC
CARDS
THAT
DO
NOT
COME
WITH
DRIVERS
THE
DOS
DRIVERS
WORK
GREAT
THIS
CARD
CAN
EASILY
BE
CONFIGURED
TO
WORK
WITH
DIFFERENT
SETS
OF
IO
PORTS
AND
YOU
CAN
USE
MULTIPLE
HOST
ADAPTERS
IN
ONE
MACHINE
IF
YOU
GET
A
NEW
CARD
IT
WILL
ALSO
BE
ABLE
TO
SUPPORT
UP
TO
GB
DRIVES
UNDER
DOS
HOPE
THIS
