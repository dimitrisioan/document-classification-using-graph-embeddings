in
article
you
write
i
recently
bought
a
used
seagate
hard
drive
the
guy
told
me
that
it
had
been
fully
tested
and
that
it
was
good
i
took
it
home
to
install
in
my
compaq
portable
ok
im
a
little
behind
in
technology
i
already
had
an
mfm
controller
i
installed
the
drive
and
powered
up
the
system
i
got
a
post
error
my
controller
is
a
western
digital
rev
c
as
i
said
above
the
drive
is
a
seagate
the
system
is
a
compaq
portable
circa
ah
finally
a
question
i
can
answer
i
mess
with
this
older
stuff
alot
kinda
fun
first
problem
i
can
forsee
is
that
the
will
not
be
compadible
with
that
wd
card
unless
it
has
the
right
bios
rom
check
the
numbers
on
it
it
should
be
the
only
nonsmt
chip
on
the
board
slightly
below
center
and
left
the
bios
should
read
either
or
if
the
last
digits
are
you
got
problems
controller
jumpers
are
set
as
follows
represents
jumper
looks
right
and
are
factory
jumped
with
a
trace
between
pins
and
to
select
the
primary
controller
address
the
drive
jumpers
are
as
follows
represents
jumper
looks
right
art
deleted
here
are
my
questions
are
the
drive
and
controller
compatible
w
each
other
i
notice
you
left
out
the
jumper
table
settings
those
are
what
control
what
drive
the
controller
thinks
it
has
if
you
have
the
rom
set
it
like
this
open
open
open
open
closed
closed

note
those
are
how
wd
runs
the
numbers
on
the
jumper
block
top
to
bottom
s
represent
the
jumper
pins
pins
and
select
the
first
drive
setting
drive
and
pins
and
select
the
second
drive
drive
if
you
have
the
rom
its
a
autoconfig
and
ill
have
to
look
up
how
to
do
it
i
dont
have
the
big
book
right
here
are
the
jumpers
on
the
carddrive
set
correctly
see
above
you
might
have
problems
if
the
jumpers
are
not
right
also
at
the
risk
of
being
insulting
make
sure
the
cables
are
on
right
and
good
on
the
jumper
on
the
try
moving
it
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
drive
its
one
or
the
other
the
narrow
data
cable
goes
to
ive
thrown
it
on
a
few
times
and
banged
my
head
for
a
day
is
my
systems
bios
in
need
of
an
upgrade
dunno
ibm
roms
had
to
be
later
than
a
quick
way
to
check
is
to
boot
dos
and
run
debug
enter
d
fffc
the
is
the
debug
prompt
this
will
return
the
rom
date
if
its
of
any
use
keith
rice
if
i
oversimplified
any
of
the
above
i
appologize
its
