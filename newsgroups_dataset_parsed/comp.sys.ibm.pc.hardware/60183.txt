RE
SOUNDBLASTER
IRQ
AND
PORT
SETTINGS
MY
SOLUTION
WAS
TO
SWITCH
THE
INTERRUPT
TO
IRQ
WHICH
IS
UNRESERVED
IN
CONTEMPORARY
COMPUTERS
USING
IRQ
FOR
THE
DRIVES
WENT
OUT
WITH
THE
XT
ARCHITECHTURE
NOT
COMPLETLY
TRUE
FOR
AT
CLASS
AND
LATER
MACHINES
IS
RESERVED
FOR
SINCE
ITS
RARE
TO
HAVE
A
SECOND
PARALLEL
PORT
IN
A
PC
ITS
USUALLY
A
GOOD
SAFE
CHOICE
IF
YOU
NEED
AN
INTERRUPT
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
WE
JUST
RAN
INTO
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THAT
HERE
AT
WORK
ON
A
GATEWAY
COMPUTER
IT
HAS
A
MODEM
ON
A
MOUSE
ON
AND
THE
OTHER
SERIAL
PORT
WAS
SET
TO
WHICH
NORMALLY
USES
THE
SAME
INTERRUPT
AS
WE
HAD
A
REAL
FIGHT
WITH
A
BOARD
WHEN
TRYING
TO
USE
AND
DISCOVERD
THE
PROBLEM
WAS
THAT
GATEWAY
HAD
SET
IT
UP
SUCH
THAT
USED
AS
SOON
AS
WE
DISABLED
OUR
PROBLEMS
WENT
AWAY
GRUMBLE
AFTER
SEVERAL
DAYS
OF
TRYING
TO
FIGURE
OUT
WHY
THE
INTERRUPT
DIDNT
WORK
