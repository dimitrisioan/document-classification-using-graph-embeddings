SAYS
I
JUST
RECEIVED
MY
GATEWAY
MINIDESKTOP
SYSTEM
THE
FIRST
THING
I
NOTICED
WHEN
I
PLUGGED
IN
THE
POWER
CORD
IS
THE
NOISE
THAT
COMES
FROM
THE
FAN
IN
FACT
I
CAN
HEAR
THE
NOISE
IN
IF
YOUR
GATEWAY
IS
EQUIPPED
WITH
A
WESTERN
HARD
DRIVE
THEN
THE
NOISE
IS
PROBABLY
COMING
FROM
THERE
AND
NOT
FROM
THE
FAN
THE
WESTERN
DRIVES
ARE
NOTORIOUSLY
NOISY
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
A
WESTERN
DRIVE
THEN
MAYBE
IT
IS
THE
FAN
THERES
NOT
ALOT
TO
DO
ABOUT
IT
EXCEPT
INSULATE
AROUND
