if
youre
considering
buying
a
system
with
a
view
to
using
it
to
run
unix
linux
bsd
etc
or
some
other
special
software
there
is
a
good
chance
that
it
will
not
work
with
the
diamond
cards
that
is
if
the
special
software
is
free
like
there
are
vendors
that
sells
diamond
x
drivers
for
commercial
unices
but
then
they
charge
this
is
due
to
diamonds
propriety
attitude
to
its
hardware
its
impossible
to
get
free
information
from
them
about
their
chips
specifically
their
dotclocks
without
paying
and
signing
nondisclosure
agreements
i
think
they
only
need
a
signing
ie
no
paying
this
still
violates
the
fsfs
policy
of
publically
available
code
this
made
it
impossible
for
the
free
software
foundation
to
provide
xwindows
compatibility
with
these
cards
as
diamond
didnt
want
to
divulge
programming
neccessities
while
this
is
true
there
are
fixes
for
those
who
have
already
bought
diamond
cards
in
linux
for
example
there
are
utilities
that
will
put
the
card
in
vesa
mode
before
invoking
x
of
course
this
means
no
fine
tuning
of
diamond
cards
but
at
least
this
will
allow
those
whore
stuck
with
them
to
use
linuxx
i
agree
with
marks
suggestion
if
you
are
buying
a
video
card
for
specialized
free
software
avoid
diamond
but
if
you
already
have
one
there
may
be
a
fix
that
can
help
you
