what
tube
does
the
viewsonic
use
does
is
support
ive
been
looking
a
a
philips
which
uses
a
sony
trinitron
tube
has
digital
controls
supports
up
to
and
has
dot
pitch
it
can
be
found
for
under
the
original
poster
john
navitsky
said
that
he
might
use
the
monitor
on
a
sparcstation
lx
the
lx
is
able
to
generate
a
picture
at
at
hz
not
officially
but
i
tried
to
set
this
resolution
and
refresh
rate
and
the
lx
came
up
with
a
nonsyncing
screen
our
tube
obviously
couldnt
handle
this
speed
at
hz
it
worked
perfectly
when
buying
a
third
party
monitor
thats
going
to
be
used
on
a
sparcstation
lx
you
might
consider
a
monitor
thats
fast
enough
to
do
at
i
dont
know
for
sure
whether
the
lx
supports
this
sun
certainly
wont
tell
you
so
youll
have
to
check
