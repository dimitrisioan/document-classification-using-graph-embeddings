re
buslogic
questions
beta
support
for
the
buslogic
cards
is
not
included
with
any
longer
why
not
this
is
rather
disappointing
if
you
wish
to
install
the
beta
from
the
cdrom
you
will
need
to
rem
out
the
adaptec
device
drivers
as
they
have
a
nasty
tendency
to
crash
the
buslogic
cards
when
attempts
to
use
them
thanks
adaptec
yep
thats
cause
the
latestand
presumably
all
future
adaptec
drivers
look
for
the
string
adaptec
or
something
to
that
effect
in
the
cards
bios
