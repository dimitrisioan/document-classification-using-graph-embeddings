MIDWEST
MICRO
OHIO
I
POSTED
ALMOST
THE
SAME
BAD
EXPERIENCE
WITH
MIDWEST
MICRO
BUT
OUR
NEWS
PROGRAM
ONLY
SENT
ONE
PARAGRAPH
OUT
OF
THE
MIDDLE
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
FACTS
THAT
A
THE
MODEMS
I
HAD
ORDERED
TWO
WOULDNT
WORK
AS
DOCUMENTED
AND
B
THE
TECH
PERSON
HAD
NO
CLUE
AS
TO
HOW
IT
SHOULD
WORK
IT
ALSO
TURNED
OUT
THAT
C
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
MODEMS
THEY
SENT
WAS
CLEARLY
USED
BUT
THE
TECHS
THOUGHT
THAT
WAS
STANDARD
PRACTICE
AND
D
THE
MODEMS
MADE
ALL
THREE
OF
MY
FLOPPY
DRIVES
QUIT
WORKING
AND
MY
TAPE
DRIVE
START
RUNNING
AWAY
THAT
THEY
ARE
INCOMPETENT
IS
ONE
THING
BUT
THAT
THEY
SELL
USED
STUFF
AS
NEW
AND
WONT
EVEN
APOLOGIZE
FOR
IT
IS
ANOTHER
STAY
AWAY
FROM
THESE
CROOKS
