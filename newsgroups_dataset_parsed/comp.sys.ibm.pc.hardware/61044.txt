A
HUMBLE
RESPONSE
TO
A
LETTER
BY
GORDON
LANG
WRITTEN
GL
I
AM
INTERRESTED
IN
THE
EXTRODINARILY
SIMPLE
CONCEPT
OF
THE
NULL
GL
MODEM
CABLE
ACTUALLY
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
SO
DONT
COUNT
THAT
LAST
GL
STATEMENT
WHAT
IM
ASKING
IS
WHAT
PINS
DOES
IT
USE
OR
WHAT
ARE
GL
ITS
SPECIFICATIONS
I
JUST
WANT
TO
SOLDER
ONE
MYSELF
INSTEAD
OF
GL
BUYING
ONE
I
DONT
EVEN
KNOW
WHAT
PORT
IS
USED
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
SAVE
YOURSELF
THE
TROUBLE
AND
GO
TO
RADIO
SHACK
THEY
HAVE
A
NULL
MODEM
ADAPTER
WHICH
IS
A
PIN
CONNECTOR
THAT
SWAPS
THE
NECESSARY
PINS
TO
ALLOW
TWO
MACHINES
TO
COMMUNICATE
THESE
ARE
A
LOT
EASIER
THAN
SOLDERING
THE
CONNECTIONS
YOURSELF
AND
USUALLY
A
BIT
MORE
RELIABLE
