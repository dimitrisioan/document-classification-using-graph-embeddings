POINT
OF
VIEW
WHY
DOES
SCSI
HAVE
AN
ADVANTAGE
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MULTI
TASKING
DATA
IS
DATA
AND
IT
COULD
BE
ANYWHERE
ON
THE
DRIVE
CAN
SCSI
FIND
IT
FASTER
CAN
IT
GET
IT
OFF
THE
DRIVE
AND
INTO
THE
COMPUTER
FASTER
DOES
IT
HAVE
A
BETTER
CACHE
SYSTEM
I
THOUGHT
SCSI
WAS
GOOD
AT
MANAGING
A
DATA
BUS
WHEN
MULTIPLE
DEVICES
ARE
ATTACHED
IF
WE
ARE
ONLY
TALKING
ABOUT
A
SINGLE
DRIVE
EXPLAIN
WHY
SCSI
IS
INHERENTLY
FASTER
AT
MANAGING
DATA
FROM
A
HARD
DRIVE
THE
ADAPTEC
USE
BUS
MASTERING
THIS
MEANS
THAT
THE
CPU
DOESNT
SIT
WAITING
FOR
DATA
BYTES
IT
CAN
GO
OFF
AND
DO
OTHER
COMPUTING
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
ADVANCED
MULTITASKING
OS
THAT
IS
DOS
JUST
SITS
AND
WAITS
ANYWAY
IDE
INTEGRATED
DEVICE
ELECTRONICS
CURRENTLY
THE
MOST
COMMON
STANDARD
AND
IS
MAINLY
USED
FOR
MEDIUM
SIZED
DRIVES
CAN
HAVE
MORE
THAN
ONE
HARD
DRIVE
ASYNCHRONOUS
TRANSFER
MAX
WHY
DONT
YOU
START
WITH
THE
SPECSHEET
OF
THE
ISA
BUS
FIRST
YOU
CAN
QUOTE
SCSI
SPECS
TILL
YOURE
BLUE
IN
THE
FACE
BUT
IF
THEY
EXCEED
THE
ISA
BUS
CAPABILITY
THEN
WHATS
THE
POINT
WHO
SAYS
IDE
IS
LIMITED
TO
MEGSSEC
WHAT
ABOUT
VLBIDE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
THEY
PERFORM
WHY
DONT
YOU
START
WITH
THE
SPECSHEET
OF
THE
ISA
BUS
FIRST
IDE
WAS
DESIGNED
TO
PLUG
INTO
ISA
VIRTUALLY
UNAIDED
IN
ESSENCE
IDE
IS
ISA
ON
A
RIBBON
CABLE
THEREFORE
ITS
SPECS
ARE
THE
SAME
AS
ISA
CLOCK
BIT
WIDTH
THIS
IS
WHY
IVE
CONCLUDED
THAT
IDE
ON
VLBUS
IS
A
WASTE
OF
A
FAST
SLOT
THE
CARDS
JOB
WOULD
TO
SLOW
THE
VLBUS
TRANSACTIONS
TO
ISA
SPEED
HECK
THATS
WHAT
ISA
SLOTS
DO
ILL
JUST
USE
ONE
OF
THOSE
INSTEAD
RICHARD
KREHBIEL
RICHKGREBYNCOM
WILL
DO
FOR
ME
UNTIL
AMIGADOS
FOR
THE
COMES
ALONG
