SENDING
A
NULL
CHARACTER
ACROSS
ETHERNET
I
HAVE
A
QUESTION
REGARDING
SENDING
A
NULL
CHARACTER
ACROSS
ETHERNET
CONNECTION
THE
ACTUAL
PROBLEM
IS
THAT
EMACS
UNIX
EDITIOR
NEEDS
THE
NULL
CHARACTER
FOR
SETTING
A
MARK
AND
UNFORTUNATELY
WE
DONT
KNOW
HOW
TO
SENT
THAT
FROM
IBM
PCS
ACROSS
ETHERNET
I
AM
WONDERING
IF
ANYBOY
KNOWS
THE
KEYBOARD
COMBINATION
FOR
SENDING
THE
NULL
CHARACTER
BTW
CONTROLSHIFT
WHICH
CTRL
DOES
NOT
WORK
THANKS
