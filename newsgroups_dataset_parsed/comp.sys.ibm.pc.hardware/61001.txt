since
the
mac
uses
only
for
hard
drives
yes
the
figure
includes
a
hundred
for
scsi
drivers
this
is
sloppy
people
and
dumb
what
group
is
this
this
is
not
a
mac
group
nice
of
you
to
delete
both
your
responce
and
the
item
that
prompted
it
to
whit
i
just
bought
at
quantum
for
my
mac
at
home
i
paid
for
it
i
tons
of
stuff
deleted
on
scsi
vs
ide
question
wow
you
guys
are
really
going
wild
on
this
ide
vs
scsi
thing
and
i
think
its
great
like
lots
of
people
id
really
like
to
increase
my
data
transfer
rate
from
the
hard
drive
right
now
i
have
a
ide
drive
seagate
and
what
i
would
say
is
a
standard
not
special
no
cache
i
believe
ide
controller
card
on
my
isa
im
currently
thinking
about
adding
another
hd
in
the
to
range
and
im
thinking
hard
you
should
hear
those
gears
agrinding
in
my
head
about
buying
a
scsi
drive
scsi
for
the
future
benefit
i
believe
im
getting
something
like
transfer
right
now
according
to
nu
how
would
this
number
compare
if
i
bought
the
stateoftheart
scsi
card
for
my
isa
pc
and
the
stateoftheart
scsi
hard
drive
the
wailingest
system
i
could
hope
for
obviously
money
factors
into
this
choice
as
well
as
any
other
but
what
would
you
want
to
use
on
your
isa
system
and
how
much
would
it
cost
along
those
lines
what
kind
of
transfer
rate
could
i
see
with
my
ide
hds
if
i
were
to
buy
the
topoftheline
ide
caching
controller
for
my
hd
and
how
much
would
it
cost
i
actually
have
a
and
could
what
a
waste
i
guess
it
would
be
hook
up
a
scsi
hd
through
its
scsi
port
which
yields
an
optimum
of
actually
i
have
a
borrowed
fujitsu
hd
hooked
up
through
it
now
and
own
the
trantor
hd
drivers
for
the
scsi
port
is
this
scsi
port
a
port
how
could
i
tell
is
the
fujitsu
a
are
all
scsi
hds
