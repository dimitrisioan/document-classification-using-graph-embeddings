hi
i
am
buying
a
quantum
mb
hardisk
and
is
deciding
a
hddfdd
controller
is
vlbus
hddfdd
controller
faster
than
bit
ide
hddfdd
controller
card
i
hear
that
the
vl
bus
controller
is
slower
than
a
ide
controller
which
one
is
true
the
vlide
adapter
can
be
much
faster
then
the
normal
ide
it
depends
on
the
drive
you
use
and
the
board
you
use
i
am
using
a
noname
vlide
io
contr
it
is
tested
under
coretest
with
kbs
using
a
cheap
seagate
and
nearly
kbs
using
a
wdcaviar
you
have
figure
out
the
jumper
setting
on
the
controller
to
get
reliable
diskaccess
fastest
setting
gets
kbs
under
coretest
but
does
not
work
reliable
you
have
to
shadow
the
adapter
bios
to
get
the
fast
speed
i
used
a
vlidecache
controller
yet
but
it
might
speed
up
twice
