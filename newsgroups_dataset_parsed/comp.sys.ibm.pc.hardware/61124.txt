RE
CPU
FANS
THE
ATTACHED
FANS
LOOK
SLICK
AND
WORK
WELL
BUT
IM
BOTHERED
BY
THE
POTENTIAL
LOSS
OF
COOLING
IF
THE
FAN
GOES
OUT
AT
LEAST
WITH
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
FAN
YOU
CAN
REACH
BACK
THERE
EVERY
FEW
DAYS
AND
FEEL
THE
FAN
BLOWING
YES
THIS
IS
A
VALID
CONCERN
IMHO
WITH
THE
DIRECTLY
ATTACHED
FAN
UNITS
IVE
SEEN
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
IF
THE
FAN
WERE
TO
STOP
THE
CHIP
COOLING
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
BIT
WORSE
THAN
NO
HEAT
SINK
AT
ALL
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
THE
FAN
STOPS
THE
UNIT
TURNS
INTO
AN
INSULATOR
AND
THE
CHIP
MIGHT
GET
HOT
ENOUGH
TO
SUFFER
PERMANENT
DAMAGE
NOT
JUST
STOP
WORKING
TEMPORARILY
A
SUGGESTION
SLAVE
HOOK
IN
SERIES
A
SMALL
PILOT
LIGHT
OFF
THE
FAN
CIRCUIT
THEN
IF
THE
LIGHT
GOES
OUT
YOU
KNOW
YOUR
FAN
IS
NOT
WORKING
