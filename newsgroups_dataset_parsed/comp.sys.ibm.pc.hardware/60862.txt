how
do
i
put
an

this
may
be
a
dumb
question
but
i
need
to
put
a
hard
drive
on
my
fathers
pcxt
either
mfm
rll
or
ide
i
know
how
to
hook
it
up
but
how
do
i
tell
the
computer
the
geometry
of
the
drive
on
my
you
set
it
in
the
bios
but
i
doubt
thats
how
its
done
on
an
xt
i
thought
it
might
be
software
with
the
controller
card
but
the
ide
card
for
xts
that
i
saw
didnt
come
with
any
also
how
do
i
low
level
format
it
once
its
on
the
computer
assuming
a
drive
which
needs
formatting
since
there
is
no
bios
support
for
interface
hard
disks
in
an
xt
that
support
must
come
from
a
bios
extension
rom
on
the
mfmrll
hard
disk
controller
usually
the
controller
has
a
rombased
low
level
format
program
a
common
jump
address
is
you
can
type
from
debug
to
see
and
a
small
table
of
drive
geometries
it
knows
about
sometimes
these
are
selectable
using
jumpers
on
the
card
sometimes
you
can
enter
them
manually
in
the
llf
menu
failing
that
you
must
use
a
thirdparty
hd
prep
program
like
speedstor
disk
manager
or
the
like
ide
drives
come
formatted
already
and
since
the
is
controller
part
of
the
drive
mechanism
itself
concerns
about
geometry
are
irrelevant
plug
it
in
and
go
to
fdisk
