THE

FOR

THIS
IS
SLOPPY
PEOPLE
AND
DUMB
WHAT
GROUP
IS
THIS
THIS
IS
NOT
A

GROUP
NICE
OF
YOU
TO
DELETE
BOTH
YOUR
RESPONCE
AND
THE
ITEM
THAT
PROMPTED
IT
TO
WHIT
I
JUST
BOUGHT
AT
QUANTUM
FOR
MY
MAC
AT
HOME
I
PAID
FOR
IT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IDE
DRIVES
CHEAPER
TO
WHICH
YOU
RESPONDED
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
JUST
GOT
A
MAXTOR

FOR
THATS
MILLION

OR
MEGABYTES
WITH
THE

TRANSFER
ON

DOES
YOUR
FIGURE
INCLUDE
A
FEW
HUNDRED
FOR
SCSI
DRIVERS
TO
WHICH
I
CORRECTLY
POINTED
OUT
THE
FOLLOWING
SINCE
THE
MAC
USES
ONLY
FOR
HARD
DRIVES
YES
THE
FIGURE
INCLUDES
A
HUNDRED
FOR

DRIVERS
THIS
IS
SLOPPY
PEOPLE
AND
DUMB
AS
I
SAID
THIS
IS
SLOPPY
AND
DUMB
YOU
SHOULD
RESOUNDED
BY
DISCOUNTING
THE
MAC
NOT
GIVING
MAXTOR
MEG
IDE
DRIVE
FOR
EXAMPLE
BY
GIVING
AN
EXAMPLE
YOU
GIVE
THE
IMPLIED
CONSENT
THAT
FOR
MAC
INFO
TO
BE
INCLUDED
IN
THE
SCSI
DISCUSION
OK
ONCE
AGAIN
WITH
THE
SCSI
SPEC
LIST
WHY
THE
SPEC
LIST
AGAIN
WE
ARE
TALKING
SCSI
ON
A
PC
NOT
ON
A
MAC
OR
A
UNIX
BOX
AND
WE
ARE
TALKING
ISA
BUS
OR
POSSIBLY
EISA
OR
VLB
OK
I
WILL
DO
THIS
V

SO
YOU
CAN
UNDERSTAND
REGUARDLESS
OF
WHETHER
IT
IS
A
MAC
OR
A
PC
AND
ARE
DIFFERENT
FROM
EACH
OTHER
AS
IS
ASYNCHRONOUS
AND
SYNCHRONOUS
ALL
OF
THESE
HAVE
DIFFERENT
SPEEDS
AND
COSTS
LUMPING
THEM
ALL
TOGETHER
AS
SCSI
IS
DUMB
AND
SLOPPY
TAKE
AGAIN
THE
QUOTE
LATER
ON
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
THE
PROBLEM
IN
THE
PC
WORLD
THE
SPEC
LIST
WAS
SO
THAT
YOU
KNEW
WHERE
THE
NUMBERS
WERE
COMING
FROM
IN
THE

IT
SHOWS
THE

IS

THIS

HOW
DO
YOU
TELL
TELL

WHAT
THE

ARE
WITH

ON

WITH

OR

ALREADY
GAVE

YOU
KEEP

HERE
ARE

THEORETICAL

NOT
RELEVANT
TO
THIS

OR
THIS
DEBATE
IM
SURE
THAT
THERE
ARE
SOME
PLATFORMS
OUT
THERE
THAT
CAN
HANDLE
THE

OF

XYZ

BUT
THE

ISINT
ONE
OF

NOTE
THAT
I
ALSO
GIVE
THE

TRUE
A

CLONE
WITH
THE
CORRECT

AND
SINCE

ADVERSIZEMENTS
ARE
USING
THEORETICAL

FIGURES
WHY
CANNOT
WE
IF
WE
ARE
TO
CONTINUE
THIS
THREAD
STATE
CLEARLY
WHICH
SCSI
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
OR
OR
SCSI
OVER
ALL
AND
IT
DOES
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
WELL
MAYBE
IF
THE
SCSI
DESIGN
PEOPLE
HAD
THEIR
ACT
TOGETHER
THAN
MAYBE
ALL
PCS
WOULD
HAVE
BUILT
IN
SCSI
PORTS
BY
NOW
WITH
PC
ARTICLES
LIKE
THE
FOLLOWING
IT
IS
OBVIOUS
THAT
THE
PROBLEM
IS
NOT
WITH
SCSI
BUT
WITH
THE
PEOPLE
WHO
REPORT
IT
LIKE
YOU
LOOK
AT
THE
INCONSITANT
USE
OF
SCSI
IN
THE
BELOW
QUOTE
MY
COMMENTS
IN
ALTHOUGH
SCSI
IS
TWICE
AS
FAST
AS
ESDITHIS
IS
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
FASTER
THAN
IDE
THIS
IS
BOTH
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
AND
PC
MAGAZINE
APRIL
THE
ARTICLE
IS
CONFUSED
NOT
SCSI
THE
TERM
IS
A
MESS
FROM
INCONSITANT
USE
NOT
BECAUSE
THE
INTERFACE
ITSELF
IS
A
MESS
SCSI
MEANS
THE
SET
OF
SCSI
INTERFACES
COMPOSED
OF
AND
NOT
AS
SOME
PEOPLE
WANT
TO
USE
IT
TO
READ
CONSITANTLY
THE
QUOTE
SHOULD
READ
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
ALTHOUGH
ASYNCHRONOUS
IS
TWICE
AS
FAST
AS
ESDI
ONE
THIRD
THE
SPEED
OF
IDE
OR
ASYNCHRONOUS
WITH
A
CHIP
OR
ALTHOUGH
WITH
A
CHIP
AND
ARE
EIGHT
TIMES
AS
FAST
AS
ESDI
FASTER
THAN
IDE
NOTE
THE
NONUSE
OF
SCSI
BY
ITSELF
THIS
ELIMINATES
AMBAGUITY
IF
WE
ARE
TO
CONTINUE
THIS
THREAD
STATE
CLEARLY
WHICH
SCSI
YOU
ARE
TALKING
ABOUT
OR
OR
SCSI
OVER
ALL
AND
LUMPING
EVERYTHING
INTO
SCSI
AS
IS
SLOPPY
WRONG
AND
DUMB
INCONSITANT
AND
USAGE
IS
ALSO
A
PROBLEM
CLEAN
IT
UP
NOW
OR
HAVE
A
MESS
LIKE
SVGA
WAS
SEVERAL
YEARS
AGO
BECAUSE
EVERYBODY
AND
HIS
UNCLE
SLAPPED
SCSA
AN
THEIR
OWN
MONITOR
INTEFACE
SCSI
IS
STANDARIZED
UNLIKE
SVGA
WAS
YEARS
AGO
EXCEPT
IN
TERMINAOLOGY
