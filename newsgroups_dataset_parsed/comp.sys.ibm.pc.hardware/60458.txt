oh
yeah
i
just
read
in
another
newsgroup
that
the
uses
a
high
quality
trinitron
tube
than
is
in
most
monitorsthe
sony
for
example
and
this
is
where
the
extra
cost
comes
from
it
is
also
where
the
high
bandwidth
comes
from
and
the
fantastic
image
and
the
large
image
size
etc
etc
i
agree
that
the
image
is
as
sharp
as
it
gets
with
these
sony
tubes
however
in
the
monitors
using
these
tubes
the
annoying
black
lines
on
the
top
and
bottom
quarters
of
the
tube
which
are
created
due
to
the
wires
holding
up
the
invar
shadow
mask
are
quite
annoying
after
a
while
that
is
the
only
thing
that
is
making
me
lean
more
in
favor
of
the
nec
or
now
also
available
the
nec
only
difference
no
accucolor
any
experiences
or
opinions
from
people
who
have
used
the
nec
would
be
appreciated
since
i
want
to
get
one
right
after
my
exams
are
all
done
ie
about
a
week
from
now
