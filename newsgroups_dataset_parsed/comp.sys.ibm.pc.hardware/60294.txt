says
in
pc
magazine
april
although
scsi
is
twice
as
fasst
as
esdi
faster
than
ide
and
support
up
to
devices
its
acceptance
has
long
been
stalled
by
incompatability
problems
and
installation
headaches
i
love
it
when
magazine
writers
make
stupid
statements
like
that
re
performance
where
do
they
get
those
numbers
ill
list
the
actual
performance
ranges
which
should
convince
anyone
that
such
a
statement
is
absurd
scsii
ranges
from
scsiii
ranges
from
ide
ranges
from
esdi
is
always
although
there
are
some
nonstandard
versions
by
your
own
data
the
although
scsi
is
twice
as
fast
as
esdi
is
correct
how
is
twice
do
you
just
pick
whatever
scsi
setup
that
makes
the
statment
correct
even
if
you
could
make
such
a
statement
it
would
be
meaningless
unless
you
understood
that
esdi
and
ide
i
include
scsi
and
ata
are
completely
different
esdi
is
devicelevel
like
mfmrll
with
a
controller
chip
can
reach
which
is
indeed
faster
than
ide
of
is
all
these
scsi
facts
have
been
great
you
can
compare
two
numbers
ata
has
several
speed
modes
by
the
way
but
what
the
article
said
was
misleadingwrong
posted
to
this
newsgroup
in
my
mac
ibm
info
sheet
available
by
ftp
on
sumexaimstanfordedu
in
the
infomacreport
as
macibmcompareversion
txt
it
should
be
but
may
still
be
there
i
would
recommend
people
call
the
ncr
board
and
download
the
ansi
specs
if
they
are
really
interested
in
this
stuff
part
of
this
problem
is
both
mac
and
ibm
pc
are
inconsiant
about
what
scsi
is
which
though
it
is
well
documented
that
the
quadra
has
a
chip
an
apple
salesperson
said
it
uses
a
fast
chip
not
at
a
burst
it
does
not
is
maximum
synchronous
and
quadra
uses
ansynchronous
scsi
which
is
slower
it
seems
that
mac
and
ibm
see
something
is
missing
there
anyway
i
agree
theres
a
lot
of
opportunity
for
marketing
jingo
like
compliant
which
tells
you
nothing
about
the
performance
whether
it
has
wide
support
etc
one
reference
for
the
quadras
controller
chip
is
digital
review
oct
what
does
it
use
hopefully
a
good
ncr
chip
eg
