is
it
going
to
take
a
year
for

a
standard

it
just
bureaucratic
slowdown

sprockets
of
the
mind

hamsters
have
a
natural
habitat
anymore

wild
hamsters

their
world
consists
only
of
a
plastic
gym
that
we
call
their
home
while
they
call
it
hell
funny
how
we
like
to
watch
others
sweat
while
our
butts
take
root
on
the
sofa
