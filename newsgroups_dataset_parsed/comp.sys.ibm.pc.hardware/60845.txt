JUAN
CARLOS
LEON
HAD
THE
UNMITIGATED
GALL
TO
SAY
THIS
JCL
I
JUST
GOT
A
PROBLEM
I
HAVE
A
CHEAPO
MODEM
WHICH
I
USE
TO
JCL
CONNECT
TO
MY
UNIVERSITY
BUT
I
GET
TOO
MUCH
GARBAGE
ON
THE
SCREEN
I
JCL
DO
KNOW
ITS
BECAUSE
THE
NOISE
IN
THE
LINE
I
CAN
ACTUALLY
HEAR
IT
JCL
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
WILL
AN
ERROR
CORRECTION
PROTOCOL
HELP
TO
ELIMINATE
JCL
THIS
GARBAGE
MY
MODEM
DOESNT
HAVE
ANY
OF
THESE
ON
HARDWARE
CAN
A
JCL
SOFTWARE
IMPLEMENTED
PROTOCOL
DO
THE
TRICK
THERE
IS
A
SOFTWARE
VERSION
OF
AVAILABLE
FROM
MTEZ
AND
IT
WILL
OFTEN
CONNECT
WITH
OTHER
MODEMS
THAT
ARE
MNP
COMPATIBLE
BUT
IF
THE
MODEM
THAT
YOU
ARE
CONNECTING
TO
DOESNT
SUPPORT
MNP
THEN
IT
WONT
HELP
ERROR
CORRECTING
MODEMS
WILL
ELIMINATE
LINE
NOISE
BUT
ONLY
ID
THERE
ARE
ERROR
CORRECTING
MODEMS
ON
BOTH
ENDS
OF
THE
CONNCETION
THE
ADDED
SOEED
IS
MUCH
WORTH
THE
PRICE
OF
ERROR
CORRECTING
MODEMS
BAUD
MODEMS
ARE
VERY
REASONABLE
AND
THEY
ARE
ONLY
ABOUT
SLOWER
THAN
THE
MORE
EXPENSIVE
MODEMS
ON
THE
MARKET

HARD
DISK
