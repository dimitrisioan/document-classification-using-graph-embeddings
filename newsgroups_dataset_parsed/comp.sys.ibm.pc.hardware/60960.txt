i
believe
that
any
vleisaisa
motherboard
that
uses
the
hint
chipset
is
limited
to
eisa
dma
where
real
eisa
dma
is
the
hint
eisa
dma
has
the
mb
ram
addressing
limitation
of
isa
for
this
reason
i
would
pass
i
own
one
of
these
hawk
vleisaisa
and
am
look
ing
to
replace
it
for
exactly
this
reason
please
doublecheck
me
on
this
in
other
words
call
the
motherboard
manufacturer
and
ask
them
if
the
motherboard
supports
true
eisa
dma
other
than
this
limitation
the
motherboard
works
quite
well
i
am
using
mine
with
dos
windows
and
unix
also
with
adaptec
eisa

you
are
correct
the
motherboard
manufacturer
where
i
usually
buy
boards
says
that
they
will
have
this
problem
fixed
in
about
two
weeks

i
dont
see
this
as
a
problem
with
the
chipset
a
mistake
i
see
this
as
something
that
was
designedin
intentionally
so
it
would
seem
that
to
enhance
the
design
from
to
eisa
dma
would
require
an
update
to
the
chipset
an
update
to
the
chipset
may
begat
an
update
to
the
motherboard
board
design
what
im
saing
is
the
motherboard
manufacturer
seems
to
be
passing
this
off
as
a
simple
fix
in
my
mind
the
fix
is
a
updated
chipset
from
hint
along
with
a
possible
motherboard
layout
update
this
is
not
simple
if
i
were
you
i
would
be
cautious
about
this
you
might
look
into
the
advanced
integration
research
air
vleisa
motherboard
all
slots
are
eisaisa
capable
or
of
the
slots
are
vlbus
capable
the
air
people
confirmed
this
board
supports
real
eisa
dma
i
called
them
capable
less
expensive
than
equivalent
ami
or
micronics
vleisa
board
look
in
computer
shopper
april
the
zenon
ads
show
the
air
mother
board
a
associate
bought
the
air
board
and
is
pleased
with
it
im
attempting
to
get
the
local
dealer
to
trade
out
the
hawk
board
for
the
