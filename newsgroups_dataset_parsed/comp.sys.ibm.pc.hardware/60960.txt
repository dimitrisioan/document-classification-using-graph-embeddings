I
BELIEVE
THAT
ANY
VLEISAISA
MOTHERBOARD
THAT
USES
THE
HINT
CHIPSET
IS
LIMITED
TO
EISA
DMA
WHERE
REAL
EISA
DMA
IS
THE
HINT
EISA
DMA
HAS
THE
MB
RAM
ADDRESSING
LIMITATION
OF
ISA
FOR
THIS
REASON
I
WOULD
PASS
I
OWN
ONE
OF
THESE
HAWK
VLEISAISA
AND
AM
LOOK
ING
TO
REPLACE
IT
FOR
EXACTLY
THIS
REASON
PLEASE
DOUBLECHECK
ME
ON
THIS
IN
OTHER
WORDS
CALL
THE
MOTHERBOARD
MANUFACTURER
AND
ASK
THEM
IF
THE
MOTHERBOARD
SUPPORTS
TRUE
EISA
DMA
OTHER
THAN
THIS
LIMITATION
THE
MOTHERBOARD
WORKS
QUITE
WELL
I
AM

YOU
ARE
CORRECT
THE
MOTHERBOARD
MANUFACTURER
WHERE
I
USUALLY
BUY
BOARDS
SAYS
THAT
THEY
WILL
HAVE
THIS
PROBLEM
FIXED
IN

I
DONT
SEE
THIS
AS
A
PROBLEM
WITH
THE
CHIPSET
A
MISTAKE
I
SEE
THIS
AS
SOMETHING
THAT
WAS
DESIGNEDIN
INTENTIONALLY
SO
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
TO
ENHANCE
THE
DESIGN
FROM
TO
EISA
DMA
WOULD
REQUIRE
AN
UPDATE
TO
THE
CHIPSET
AN
UPDATE
TO
THE
CHIPSET
MAY
BEGAT
AN
UPDATE
TO
THE
MOTHERBOARD
BOARD
DESIGN
WHAT
IM
SAING
IS
THE
MOTHERBOARD
MANUFACTURER
SEEMS
TO
BE
PASSING
THIS
OFF
AS
A
SIMPLE
FIX
IN
MY
MIND
THE
FIX
IS
A
UPDATED
CHIPSET
FROM
HINT
ALONG
WITH
A
POSSIBLE
MOTHERBOARD
LAYOUT
UPDATE
THIS
IS
NOT
SIMPLE
IF
I
WERE
YOU
I
WOULD
BE
CAUTIOUS
