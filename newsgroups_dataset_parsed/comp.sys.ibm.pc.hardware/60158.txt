my
system
im
using
a
small
card
not
accelerated
made
by
archive
to
attach
my
tape
drive
as
a
third
floppy
device
the
problem
although
the
dosbased
qicstream
software
works
just
fine
both
the
norton
and
central
point
backup
programs
for
windows
fail
unless
i
switch
the
machine
to
nonturbo
speed
im
using
a
eisa

the
dos
software
works

cant
be
a
hardware
problem
