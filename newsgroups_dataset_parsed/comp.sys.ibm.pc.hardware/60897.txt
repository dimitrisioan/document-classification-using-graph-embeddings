date
wed
apr
the
temp
on
my
is
over
measured
with
a
ktype
thermocouple
and
fluke
dig
thermometer
this
is
an
idle
temp
not
doing
lots
of
bus
io
not
doing
floating
point
not
doing
protected
mode
etc
this
is
in
a
micron
computer
without
heatsink
i
recently
put
a
heatsinkfan
on
the
chip
but
i
might
take
the
fan
off
it
makes
a
horrible
whine
at
times
and
i
wonder
what
the
vibration
is
doing
to
the
pins
on
the
cpu
etc

dont
worry
about
the
whine
of
the
fan
it
will
go
away
in
about
weeks
of
use
mine
did
as
to
the
vibration
well
that
something
i
thought
about
to
as
i
have
a
tower
case
and
the
mb
is
mounted
vertically
so
i
mounted
the
fan
on
the
case
so
that
it
just
blows
air
at
the
cpu
and
its
heatsink
instead
work
just
like
a
charm
but
the
realy
biggy
to
think
about
is
after
the
whine
goes
away
on
the
fan
if
the
fan
should
stop
burn
out
how
would
you
ever
know
this
before
the
cpu
goes
up
in
smoke
thats
what
you
should
be
thinking
about
i
have
the
parts
together
but
have
not
had
the
time
to
assemble
them
as
yet
but
you
build
a
thermistor
controlled
circuit
that
will
turn
on
a
pesso
speaker
and
a
led
when
the
temp
goes
above
the
normal
operating
range
or
there
abouts
cheep
to
do
if
you
use
radio
shack
junk
under
about
that
one
for
a
while
sam
goshi

just
installed
