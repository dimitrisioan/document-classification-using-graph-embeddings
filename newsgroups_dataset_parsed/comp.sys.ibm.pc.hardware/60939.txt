are
we
talking
about
a
device
eg
hd
on
a
controller
or
are
we
talking
about
a
controller
that
had
a
chip
upgrade
using
the
same
chip
that
is
on
a
controller
board
we
are
talking
about
a
device
eg
hd
on
a
controller
here
is
a
rewrite
of
my
mac
info
sheet
scsi
section
scsi
only
external
device
expansion
interface
common
to
both
mac
and
ibm
allows
the
use
of
any
device
hard
drive
printer
scanner
nubus
card
expansion
mac
plus
only
some
monitors
and
cdrom
normal
asynchronous
scsi
is
mhz
fast
synchronous
scsi
is
mhz
difference
between
these
modes
is
mainly
in
the
software
drivers
main
problem
there
are
a
lot
of
external
devices
which
are
internal
terminated
which
causes
problems
for
more
then
two
devises
off
the
scsi
port
a
scsi
chain
is
supposed
to
be
terminated
only
at
the
begining
and
end
any
other
set
up
causes
problems
for
either
mac
or
ibm
devices
per
scsi
controller
asynchronous
ave
and
synchronous
max
transfers
is
often
mistaken
for
a
fast
version
of
see
for
details
fully
compliant
mode
devices
per
scsi
controller
is
implimented
as
a
very
fast
since
it
can
run
using
hardware
and
software
drivers
which
limits
it
to
devices
which
results
in
it
sometimes
being
mistakenly
consitered
part
of
and
require
different
ports
electronics
and
scsi
software
drivers
from
which
makes
them
more
expensive
than
other
scsi
interfaces
scsi
seems
to
run
only
in
synchronous
mode
hence
term
wide
and
fast
scsi
transfer
speeds
are
with
burst
with
burst
and
with
burst
is
the
biggest
headache
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
the
only
that
i
know
of
that
can
pump
speeds
through
devices
and
software
controlers
its
main
implimentation
is
on
the
mac
though
you
do
see
adds
for
at
maximum
throughput
for
pcs
since
does
not
need
all
the
hardware
including
electonics
and
software
of
and
it
is
the
cheepest
of
the
interfaces
just
pop
out
the
electornics
and
pop
in
electronics
some
people
consider
where
really
starts
i
used
to
be
one
of
them
but
average
though
put
with
a
theoretical
burst
of
is
not
but
is
rule
of
thumb
if
it
is
scsin
and
over
then
it
is
some
type
of
scsi
can
use
part
of
electronics
which
further
reduces
its
cost
compared
to
and
