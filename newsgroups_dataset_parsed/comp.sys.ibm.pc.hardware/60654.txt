one
particular
box
of
diskettets
in
the
a
drive
when
i
boot
up
rather
than
getting
the
nonsystem
diskette
message
the
machine
hangs
and
the
cmos
gets
overwritten
luckily
gateway
sends
a
print
of
the
standard
cmos
settings
with
their
systems
this
only
happens
with
a
box
of
preformatted
fuji
disks
that
i
have
no
other
disks
cause
this
problem
if
i
reformat
one
of
the
fuji
disks
the
problem
goes
away
i
did
a
virus
scan
scan
of
the
disks
and

any
idea

is
going
on
