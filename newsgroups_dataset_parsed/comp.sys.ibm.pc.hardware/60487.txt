anybody
seen
the
date
get
stuck
im
running
msdos
with
a
menu
system
alive
all
the
time
the
machine
is
left
running
all
the
time
suddenly
the
date
no
longer
rolls
over
the
time
is
reasonably
accurate
allways
but
we
have
to
change
the
date
by
hand
every
morning
this
involves
exiting
the
menu
system
to
get
to
dos
ive
started
to
notice
the
same
thing
myself
im
running
dos
and
win
so
i
can
fix
it
from
the
windows
control
panel
at
times
it
is
the
date
at
others
the
clock
seems
to
be
running
several
minutes
behind
where
it
should
be
did
i
once
hear
that
in
order
for
the
date
to
advance
something
like
a
clock
has
to
make
a
get
date
system
call
apparently
the
clock
hardware
interrupt
and
bios
dont
do
this
date
advance
automatically
the
get
date
call
notices
that
a
midnight
reset
flag
has
been
set
and
then
then
advances
the
date
anybody

more
