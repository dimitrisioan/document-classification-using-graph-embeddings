CONNER
PROBLEM
HI
RECENTLY
WHEN
I
RUN
THE
NORTON
DISK
SURFACE
TEST
I
REALIZE
A
SLOW
DOWN
IN
HARDDISK
ACCESSING
AT
BEGINING
OF
THE
TEST
THE
HARDDISK
WILL
BE
CHECKED
AT
THE
SPEED
THAT
USUALLY
IS
AS
THE
SURFACE
TEST
SCANED
HALF
WAY
THROUGH
MY
HARDDISK
A
TREMENDOUS
SLOW
DOWN
OCCURED
THE
EXPECTED
TIME
FOR
OPERATION
WILL
JUMP
FROM
TO
MINUTES
I
TRY
TO
USE
SOME
OF
THE
HARDDISK
TOOLS
TO
CHECK
IF
THERE
IS
ANY
PHYSICAL
DAMAGE
TO
MY
HARDDISK
AND
REPORT
ALWAYS
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
NONE
THE
SURFACE
TEST
ONLY
SLOW
DOWN
FOR
A
CERTAIN
SECTION
OF
THE
DISK
AND
TURN
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
SPEED
AFTER
IT
GETS
OVER
THE
SECTION
I
AM
WONDERING
WHETHER
IT
IS
A
HARDDISK
PROBLEM
OR
SOME
OTHER
PROBLEMS
ANYWAY
HELP
OR
COMMENT
WILL
BE
