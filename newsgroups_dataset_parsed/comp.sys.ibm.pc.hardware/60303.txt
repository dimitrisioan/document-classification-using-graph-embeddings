TOM
HUOT
WRITES
I
WOULD
ALSO
LIKE
AN
EXPLANATION
OF
THIS
IF
ANYONE
CAN
EXPLAIN
WHY
THE
SB
PRO
AND
LPT
CAN
SHARE
AN
IRQ
PLEASE
DO
SO
I
THINK
ITS
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
DOS
DOESNT
USE
THE
IRQ
FOR
ANYTHING
DOES
SO
WITH
THAT
YOU
CANT
SHARE
THE
IRQ
THAT
IS
CORRECT
IN
DOS
YOU
CAN
USE
IRQ
FOR
YOUR
SBYOU
CANT
DO
THAT
UNDER
BECAUSE
IT
USES
IRQ
FOR
THE
PRINTER
