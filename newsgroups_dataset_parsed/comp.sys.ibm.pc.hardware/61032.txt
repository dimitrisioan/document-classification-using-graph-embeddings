DANNY
HALAMISH
WRITES
WELL
IVE
INSTALLED
DOS
IN
THREE
DIFFERENT
SYSTEMS
WITH
AND
WITHOUT
STACKER
A
FRIEND
INSTALLED
IT
IN
TWO
OTHER
SYSTEMS
BOTH
WITH
STACKER
NOT
A
SINGLE
PROBLEM
EXCEPT
PERHAPS
SOME
MINOR
BUGS
WITH
CONFIGSYS
MENUS
HES
RIGHT
YA
KNOW
IVE
HELPED
TO
INSTALL
DOS
ON
ABOUT
COMPUTERS
NOW
MINE
INCLUDED
ON
ONE
HE
BOUGHT
THE
STACKER
TO
DOUBLESPACE
CONVERTER
AND
IT
WORKED
FINE
RATHER
HE
SENT
IN
THE
COUPON
FOR
THE
CONVERTER
IN
OTHER
CASES
IVE
RUN
THE
DOUBLESPACE
INSTALLATION
WITHOUT
A
PROBLEM
WHEN
COMPRESSING
A
NEW
DRIVE
COMPRESSING
FREE
SPACE
OR
WHATEVER
ELSE
SEEMS
TO
WORK
FOR
ME
OFCOURSE
WE
DID
NOT
REPEAT
NOT
RUN
ANY
PROGRAM
CALLED
INSTALL
OR
SETUP
OR
A
VERY
SOPHISTICATED
AI
AUTOCONFIGURING
SETUP
INSTALLATION
PROGRAM
THAT
WILL
THINK
FOR
YOU
AND
DO
WHAT
YOU
NEVER
WANTED
TO
DO
BUT
COULDNT
STOP
IT
FROM
DOING
WELL
I
RAN
THE
NORMAL
SETUP
THING
AND
IT
WORKED
FINE
FOR
WHATEVER
THATS
WORTH
ALSO
DBLSPACE
IS
CRAP
IT
WRITES
ABOUT
SLOWER
THAN
STACKER
READS
ABOUT
SLOWER
AND
COMPRESSES
ABOUT
LESS
ALL
TESTS
WERE
MADE
ON
THE
SAME
COMPUTER
WITH
THE
SAME
DISK
NO
CACHE
AND
THE
SAME
BIG
FILES
WERE
USED
COULDNT
AGREE
MORE
ON
MY
I
DONT
MISS
THE
SPEED
ITS
STILL
FASTER
THAN
A
NORMAL
DISK
READ
WOULD
BE
AS
FOR
THE
LESS
COMPRESSION
IVE
SACRIFICED
THAT
IN
FAVOR
OF
THE
CONVENIENCE
OF
HAVING
THE
DBLSPACEBIN
LOAD
BEFORE
ANYTHING
ELSE
WITH
STACKER
ANY
CHANGES
TO
YOUR
CONFIGSYS
OR
AUTOEXECBAT
MEANT
REBOOTING
TWICE
SO
IT
COULD
UPDATE
THOSE
PERSONALLY
IM
WAITING
FOR
STACKER
TO
COME
OUT
AND
IMPLEMENT
THOSE
HOOKS
AND
STUFF
PLUS
THE
DEFRAG
THAT
COMES
WITH
DOS
IS
OKAY
BUT
I
MUCH
PREFER
COMPRESS
FROM
PCTOOLS
FOR
SHEER
BELLS
AND
WHISTLES
PLUS
DEFRAG
IS
SOOOOO
SLOOOOW
ON
A
DBLSPACE
DRIVE
BUT
DOS
IS
QUITE
GOOD
REFORMAT
DISKS
I
HONESTLY
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
YOU
HAD
TO
DO
THIS
