RE
IDE
VS
SCSI
WLSMITHVALVEHEARTRRIUWOCA
WAYNE
SMITH
WRITES
WHAT
DOES
A
MEG
MEGSSEC
SCSI
DRIVE
COST
SINCE
THE
QUADRA
IS
THE
ONLY
MAC
ABLE
TO
DEAL
WITH
AND
HARD
DRIVES
START
AT
I
HAVE
NO
IDEA
FOR
THE
MAC
I
HAVE
THE
FOLLOWING
THESE
ARE
ALL
EXTERNAL
ETC
SO
FOR
THE
MAC
GOES
DOWN
IN
PRICEMB
AS
HARD
DRIVE
SIZE
GOES
UP
AND
I
ASSUME
THE
SAME
FOR
THE
PC
WORLD
I
WONT
ARGUE
THAT
THE
SCSI
STANDARD
MAKES
FOR
A
GOOD
WELL
IMPLIMENTED
DATA
HIGHWAY
BUT
I
STILL
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHY
IT
INTRINSICALLY
BETTER
THAN
IDE
ON
AN
ISA
BUS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MULTITASKING
OSS
WHEN
MANAGING
DATA
FROM
A
SINGLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
WELL
SCSI
IS
ALSO
A
FLOPPY
DRIVE
INTERFACE
IN
THE
MAC
SINCE
SCSI
IS
THE
INTEFACE
FOR
ANY
NONCARD
NONMODEM
NOTKEYBOARD
DEVICE
THE
ID
IS
USED
FOR
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
CALLED
CPU
IN
ALL
IDENTIFIERS
THIS
ALLOWS
CROSS
DRIVE
INTERFACING
AS
FAST
AS
THE
OS
PROGRAM
CPU
SCSI
AND
DRIVE
CAN
HANDLE
ITTHIS
SHOWS
UP
BEST
IN
THE
QUATRA
LINE
IN
THE
IBM
THAT
USES
SCSI
FOR
THE
FLOPPY
DRIVE
THIS
SHOULD
HAPPEN
AS
WELL
ALSO
SCSI
IS
NOT
JUST
DRIVES
BUT
PRINTERS
SCANNERS
EXPANDSION
CARDS
THIS
SHOWED
UP
FOR
THE
PLUS
AS
THE
NUBUS
CAGE
CDROM
ETC
IDE
SEEMS
TO
BE
MAINLY
HARD
DRIVES
AS
FOR
SPECS
NOBODY
HAS
GIVEN
ME
ANY
AND
I
CANT
FIND
ANY
BESIDES
THE
ADVERTIZMENTS
CALL
IDE
THE
AT
INTERFACE
MAKE
OF
THAT
WHAT
YOU
WILL
SCSI
IS
A
JACK
OF
ALL
TRADES
AND
IDE
IS
A
MASTER
OF
ONE
THIS
ALONE
PUTS
SCSI
ABOVE
IDE
BLOWS
IDE
OUT
OF
THE
WATER
REMEMBER
SCSI
WAS
USED
IN
HIGH
PRICED
MACHINES
UNTIL
ABOUT
MONTHS
AGO
WHEN
THE
MAC
PRICES
CAME
DOWN
TO
EARTH
SO
THE
RULE
OF
SCALE
STILL
PLAYED
AND
SCSI
REMAINED
HIGH
COSTCHEAP
SEEMS
TO
MEAN
CHEZZY
IN
THE
HIGH
END
COMPUTER
WORLD
AT
TIMES
AND
THIS
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
PROABLY
KEPT
SCSI
OFF
INTO
THE
STATOSPHERE
PRICE
WISE
SCSI
CAME
FROM
THE
HIGH
END
COMPUTER
WORLD
WITH
MULTITASKING
OS
WERE
THE
STANDARD
FOR
THE
MOST
PART
OF
ALL
THE
INTERFACE
NEXT
COULD
HAVE
USED
IT
CHOOSE
SCSI
IN
AND
MODE
SCSI
IS
A
MULTITASKING
OS
DESINED
INTERFACE
WHILE
IDE
AND
SCSI
ARE
BRAINDEAD
RUN
ONE
PROGRAM
INTERFACES
AT
LEAST
THE
WAY
MAC
USE
SCSIUGH
