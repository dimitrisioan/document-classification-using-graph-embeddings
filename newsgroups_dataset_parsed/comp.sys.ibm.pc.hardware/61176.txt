tower
without
a
fan
i
originally
posted
a
complaint
about
how
noisy
my
pc
was
i
got
several
useful
suggestions
but
was
the
most
seductive
run
your
pc
in
silence
by
removing
the
fan
altogether
two
variables
i
always
run
my
pc
without
the
cover
and
id
be
willing
to
attach
a
cpu
cooler
if
that
would
make
a
difference
should
i
try
to
run
my
pc
without
a
fan
i
know
it
sounds
like
utter
folly
so
im
asking
has
anyone
done
this
succesfully
or
tragically
youre
answer
may
save
my
pc
thanks
