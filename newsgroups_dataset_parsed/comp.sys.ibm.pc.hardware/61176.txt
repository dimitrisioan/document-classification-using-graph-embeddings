TOWER
WITHOUT
A
FAN
I
ORIGINALLY
POSTED
A
COMPLAINT
ABOUT
HOW
NOISY
MY
PC
WAS
I
GOT
SEVERAL
USEFUL
SUGGESTIONS
BUT
WAS
THE
MOST
SEDUCTIVE
RUN
YOUR
PC
IN
SILENCE
BY
REMOVING
THE
FAN
ALTOGETHER
TWO
VARIABLES
I
ALWAYS
RUN
MY
PC
WITHOUT
THE
COVER
AND
ID
BE
WILLING
TO
ATTACH
A
CPU
COOLER
IF
THAT
WOULD
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
SHOULD
I
TRY
TO
RUN
MY
PC
WITHOUT
A
FAN
I
KNOW
IT
SOUNDS
LIKE
UTTER
FOLLY
SO
IM
ASKING
HAS
ANYONE
DONE
THIS
SUCCESFULLY
OR
TRAGICALLY
YOURE
ANSWER
MAY
SAVE
MY
PC
