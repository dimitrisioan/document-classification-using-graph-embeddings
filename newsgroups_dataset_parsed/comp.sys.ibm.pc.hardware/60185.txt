a
isa
system
with
meg
i
am
using
a
diamond
speedstar
hicolor
video
card
with
meg
vram
and
a
standard
ctx
svga
monitor
when
i
am
running
windows
and
i
have
overlapping
windows
say
an
application
overlapping
the
program
manager
window
and
i
close
the
active
application
window
erasure
is
very
slow
the
part
of
the
window
that
is
not
overlapping
is
erased
first
very
slowly
this
also
happens
when
i
iconify
an
application
the
hicolor
card
is
advertised
as
a
fasterthanstandard
video
card
but
it
does
not
have
an
accelerator
chip
on
it
i
am
running
at
is
this
slow
speed
simply
to
be
expected
without
an
accelerator
chip
or
is
there
something
else
that
is
bottlenecking
the
system
that
i
am
unaware
of
thanks
