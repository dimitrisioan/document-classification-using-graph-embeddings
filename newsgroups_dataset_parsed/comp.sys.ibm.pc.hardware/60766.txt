S
THERE
IS
ONE
PARAM
IN
THE
BIOS
SETUP
THAT
SAYS
AT
BUS
CLK
I
HAVE
S
IT
SET
TO
THE
DEFAULT
OF
BUT
WAS
ABLE
TO
GET
IT
TO
WORK
WITH
S
THE
SI
AT
WAS
I
DIDNT
WANT
TO
MESS
ANYTHING
UP
S
SO
I
SET
IT
BACK
TO
ALSO
THE
PC
DIDNT
BOOT
WITH
IT
SET
AT
S
S
WHAT
EXACTLT
DOWS
THIS
DO
AND
SHOULD
I
LEAVE
IT
AT
I
THINK
ITS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
LET
ATBUS
OPERATED
TOO
MUCH
MORE
THAN
I
HAVE
A
C
T
NEAT
MOTHER
BOARD
AND
I
SET
THE
ATBUS
CLOCK
TO
MHZ
BUT
THE
HD
STOPPED
WHEN
IT
BOOT
SO
ITS
CORRECT
THAT
CLKN
MEANS
HOW
MANY
WAIT
STATES
SM
I
THINK
IT
ALL
DEPENDS
ON
YOUR
MOTHERBOARD
AND
THE
CARDS
YOU
HAVE
IN
YOUR
SYSTEM
YOUR
HD
STOPPED
BOOT
PROBABLY
BECAUSE
YOUR
HD
CONTROLLER
CANT
HANDLE
THE
FASTER
BUS
SPEED
I
HAVE
A
I
SET
MY
BUS
DIVIDER
TO
THAT
IS
CLOSE
TO
I
CAN
GAIN
SINGIFICANT
PERFORMACE
INCREASE
ON
MY
VIDEO
CARD
AND
HARDDISK
TRANSFER
RATE
WHEN
I
BOOST
THE
BUS
SPEED
AND
MY
SYSTEM
WORK
FLAWLESSLY
UNDER
THIS
SETTING
AND
YOU
KNOW
WHAT
WHEN
I
GO
TO
BUS
MY
HD
REFUSE
TO
BOOT
JUST
MY
CENT
