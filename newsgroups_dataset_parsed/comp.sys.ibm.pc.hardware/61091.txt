OHIO
DATE
THU
APR
I
POSTED
ALMOST
THE
SAME
BAD
EXPERIENCE
WITH
MIDWEST
MICRO
BUT
OUR
NEWS
PROGRAM
ONLY
SENT
ONE
PARAGRAPH
OUT
OF
THE
MIDDLE
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
FACTS
THAT
A
THE
MODEMS
I
HAD
ORDERED
TWO
WOULDNT
WORK
AS
DOCUMENTED
AND
B
THE
TECH
PERSON
HAD
NO
CLUE
AS
TO
HOW
IT
SHOULD
WORK
IT
ALSO
TURNED
OUT
THAT
C
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
MODEMS
THEY
SENT
WAS
CLEARLY
USED
BUT
THE
TECHS
THOUGHT
THAT

AND
D
THE
MODEMS
MADE
ALL

START
RUNNING
AWAY
THAT
THEY
ARE
INCOMPETENT

ONE
THING
BUT
THAT
THEY
SELL
USED
STUFF
AS
NEW
AND
WONT
EVEN
APOLOGIZE
FOR
IT
IS
ANOTHER
