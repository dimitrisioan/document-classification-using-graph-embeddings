would
liek
to
get
a
ide
controller
card
for
my
vlb
motherboard

are
good
options
for
this
preferably
under

must
also
work
under
and
be
compatible
with
stacker
and
other
disk
compression

i
have
a
maxtor
on
an
isa
ide
controller
although
my
machine
is
vlb
i
has
the
save
transfer
rate
of
mbs
regardless
of
the
variations
of
the
isa
bus
speed
i
tested
it
with
speed
between

not
any
