READY
TO
UNWRAP
POWERPC
PROCESSOR
THE
WRAPS
WILL
COME
OFF
THE
POWERPC
PROCESSOR
THIS
WEEK
AS
MOTOROLA

AND
APPLE
COMPUTER
INC
DETAIL
THE
RESULTS
OF
THEIR
YEARLONG
EFFORT
THIS
FIRST
IN
A
SERIES
OF
POWERPC
PROCESSORS
WILL
BE
A
PROCESSOR
WITH
A
MEMORY
INTERFACE
MUCH
LIKE
INTEL
CORPS
PENTIUM
WITH
THE
CAPABILITY
OF
PERFORMING
AS
MANY
AS
THREE
INSTRUCTIONS
PER
CLOCK
CYCLE
ACCORDING
TO
SOURCES
FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
CHIP
MOTOROLA
IS
EXPECTED
TO
RELEASE
THE
CHIP
IN
VOLUME
BY
YEAR
END
IN
TWO
CONFIGURATIONS
RUNNING
AT
AND
MHZ
WITH
PERFORMANCE
OF
AND
MARKS
RESPECTIVELY
SOURCES
SAID
FLOATINGPOINT
PERFORMANCE
FOR
THE
PROCESSORS
WILL
BE
EVEN
BETTER
AS
THEIR
PERFORMANCE
WILL
BE
AND
RESPECTIVELY
THE
A
SCALEDDOWN
VERSION
OF
THE
POWER
CHIP
DEVELOPED
BY
IBM
FOR
ITS
WORKSTATIONS
WILL
ALSO
INCLUDE
A
SINGLE
BUFFERED
CACHE
ON
THE
CHIP
WITH
PROTOCOLS
TO
SUPPORT
MOTOROLAS
MULTIPROCESSOR
BUS
BUILT
IN
THE
CHIP
WHICH
IS
BEING
DESIGNED
INITIALLY
TO
SUPPORT
THE
MICRO
CHANNEL
ARCHITECTURE
IS
BUS
INDEPENDENT
SO
VENDORS
COULD
DEVELOP
POWERPC
BASED
SYSTEMS
USING
A
NUMBER
OF
DIFFERENT
ARCHITECTURES
INCLUDING
ISA
EISA
OR
SUN
MICROSYSTEMS
INCS
SBUS
DESIGN

ACCORDING

FAMILIAR
WITH
THE
DEVELOPMENT
EFFORT
MOTOROLA
HAS
BEEN
EXTREMELY
SUCCESSFUL
IN
DEVELOPING
THE
POWERPC
AS
AN
INEXPENSIVE
ARCHITECTURE
DESPITE
A
COMPLEX
DESIGN
MADE
UP
OF
MORE
THAN
MILLION
TRANSISTORS
USING
A
TECHNOLOGY
INITIAL
CHIPS
ARE
EXPECTED
TO
BE
PRICED
FROM
TO
ONLY
SLIGHTLY
HIGHER
THAN
INTEL
CORPS
PROCESSORS
BUT
COULD
BE
SOLD
PROFITABLY
FOR
LESS
