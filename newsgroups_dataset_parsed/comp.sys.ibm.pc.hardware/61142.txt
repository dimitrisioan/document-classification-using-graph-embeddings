TIM
CICERAN
WRITES
AFTER
READING
MANY
POSTINGS
CONCERNING
HARD
DRIVES
IM
STILL
UNCLEAR
ABOUT
ONE
THING
THESE
NEW
CACHED
HARD
DRIVES
IS
THE
CACHE
ON
THE
DRIVE
ITSELF
OR
IS
IT
SEPARATE
LIKE
ON
THE
CONTROLLER
OR
SOMETHING
THANKS
TO
ANYONE
WHO
CAN
CLEAR
THIS
UP
I
HAVE
TWO
SCSI
HARD
DRIVES
EACH
HAS
OF
CACHE
THERE
SEVERAL
REASONS
FOR
THIS
WHEN
THE
DRIVE
HAS
READ
REQUESTED
DATA
FROM
THE
DISK
THE
SCSI
BUS
MAY
BE
BUSY
THIS
DATA
NEEDS
TO
BE
STORED
SOME
WHERE
UNTIL
THE
BUS
IS
FREE
AND
THE
DATA
CAN
BE
TRANSMITTED
WHEN
THE
DRIVE
RECEIVES
DATA
TO
BE
WRITTEN
THE
DATA
CAN
COME
DOWN
THE
BUS
FASTER
THAN
THE
DRIVE
CAN
WRITE
IT
TO
THE
DISK
IT
NEEDS
TO
BE
STORED
SOMEWHERE
WHILE
THE
DISK
IS
WRITING
IT
OUT
IN
THESE
SITUATIONS
THE
MEMORY
IS
BEING
USED
AS
A
BUFFER
NOT
A
CACHE
MAY
BE
THE
DRIVE
DOES
SOME
READADEAD
CACHING
AS
WELL
