HI
I
WILL
CHANGE
MY
SOON
AND
I
READ
SOMETHING
ABOUT
THE
IBM
PS
VALUEPOINT
ANYONE
HAVE
ONE
THE
VIDEO
CARD
IS
REALLY
A
BIT
CARD
HOW
MUCH
COST
IN
US
AND
THE
LAST
QUESTION
CAN
THE
PS
VALUE
POINT
SX
UPGRADE
TO
A
THANK
YOU
VEEERY
MUCH
IN

THESE
QUESTIONS
CAN
BE
ANSWERED
BY
ANY
DEALER
OF
IBM
VALUE
POINTS
BUT
I
WILL
PROVIDE
SOME
UNSOLICITED
ADVICE
THE
MOST
AMUSING
KIND
OF
ADVICE
TODAY
TUEDAY
IBM
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
OFFICIALLY
ANNOUNCE
THE
INTRODUCTION
OF
THE
VESA
LOCAL
BUS
VALUE
POINT
SYSTEMS
THESE
SYSTEMS
STILL
HAVE
ONBOARD
VIDEO
AND
DISK
WHICH
ARE
FAR
BETTER
THAN
THE
PRIOR
VALUE
POINT
SYSTEMS
AND
YOU
GET
VESA
LOCAL
BUS
FOR
FUTURE
UPGRADES
WE
ARE
GOING
TO
BUY
THREE
OF
THEM
WITH
MONITORS
ALSO
A
NEWLY
AVAILABLE
AND
ONE
OF
THE
THREE
WILL
IMMEDIATELY
BE
UPGRADED
TO
ULTRASTOR
CACHING
SCSI
DISK
CONTROLLER
AND
EITHER
THE
ATI
GUP
OR
THE
VIPER
GRAPHICS
BOARD
DO
NOT
BUY
A
SYTEM
MY
PERSONAL
PHILOSOPHY
ON
UPGRADE
POLICY
IS
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
LOSSFREE
WHEN
YOU
EARN
MONEY
YOU
PAY
TAXES
WHEN
YOU
SPEND
MONEY
YOU
PAY
TAXES
IE
THEY
GET
YOU
COMING
AND
GOING
TRANSLATED
THIS
MEANS
TAKE
INFREQUENT
BUT
LARGE
STEPS
YOU
ARE
FAR
BETTER
OFF
SHORT
TERM
AND
LONG
TERM
IF
YOU
AVOID
THE
SX
MODELS
AND
GO
STRAIGHT
TO
THE
DX
OR
MODELS
