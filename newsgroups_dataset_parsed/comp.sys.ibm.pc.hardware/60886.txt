THINKING
OF
BUYING
FROM
MIDWEST
MICRO
OF
OHIO
THINK
VERY
CAREFULLY
UNLESS
YOU
ARE
ABSOLUTELY
SURE
YOU
WONT
HAVE
ANY
PROBLEMS
YOU
MAY
WANT
TO
TRADE
ELSEWHERE
DESPITE
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
ANSWER
THE
PHONE
HI
IM
WHOEVER
AND
WERE
HAVING
A
GREAT
DAY
THEY
WERENT
QUITE
SO
HAPPY
WHEN
I
WANTED
TO
RETURN
A
MODEM
THAT
DIDNT
WORK
AS
I
EXPECTED
IT
TO
THE
DETAILS
I
ORDERED
ONE
OF
THEIR
HOUSE
BRAND
INFOTEL
INTERNAL
FAX
MODEMS
IN
REALITY
IT
WAS
A
TWINCOM
LIGHTNING
FAX
THAT
HAD
A
PAPER
STICKER
OVER
THE
NAME
GIVEN
THE
POOR
REPORTS
ON
THE
NET
ABOUT
THIS
MODEM
I
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
ORDERED
IT
HAD
I
KNOWN
THIS
IN
ADVANCE
IT
ARRIVED
ON
TIME
THE
DOCUMENTATION
STATED
THAT
IT
WOULD
WORK
AND
WAS
PRECONFIGURED
AS
PROVIDING
THAT
WAS
NOT
IN
USE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
FOR
SEVERAL
REASONS
I
HAVE
A
SERIAL
CARD
CONFIGURED
FOR
AT
THE
TIME
I
INSTALLED
THE
MODEM
NOTHING
WAS
CONNECTED
TO
ALTHOUGH
THE
MODEM
APPEARED
TO
WORK
DURING
EVERY
CONNECTION
AT
OR
IT
WOULD
RANDOMLY
BREAK
THE
CONNECTION
AND
HANG
UP
THE
PHONE
AFTER
SPENDING
SOME
TIME
ON
THE
PHONE
WITH
MIDWESTS
TECH
SUPPORT
THEY
SUGGESTED
DISABLING
THE
PORT
THIS
APPEARED
TO
SOLVE
THE
DISCONNECT
PROBLEM
BUT
WAS
AN
UNACCEPTABLE
LONG
TERM
SOLUTION
I
HAD
TO
HAVE
AND
AVAILABLE
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
BOTH
WOULD
NOT
BE
IN
USE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AS
THE
MODEM
I
CALLED
BACK
MINUTES
PRIOR
TO
THEIR
CLOSING
AND
WAITED
IN
VOICEMAIL
HELL
LISTENING
TO
REPEATED
ADVERTISEMENTS
FOR
MIDWEST
MICRO
PRODUCTS
I
WAS
THEN
PROMPTLY
DISCONNECTED
APPARENTLY
IT
WAS
QUITING
TIME
AND
THEY
DIDNT
WANT
TO
BE
BOTHERED
WITH
CALLERS
THAT
HAD
BEEN
WAITING
ON
THE
LINE
I
CALLED
THE
NEXT
DAY
AND
ASKED
THE
CUSTOMER
DISERVICE
AGENT
FOR
AN
RMA
NUMBER
SHE
PROMPTLY
SWITCHED
ME
TO
A
TECH
SUPPORT
REP
THAT
IMPLIED
THAT
IT
WAS
MY
EQUIPMENT
AT
FAULT
AND
THAT
HE
WASNT
GOING
TO
GIVE
ME
AN
RMA
NUMBER
HE
SUGGESTED
I
USE
SOME
NONSTANDARD
IRQ
SETTINGS
A
SOLUTION
I
WAS
NOT
HAPPY
WITH
THE
MODEM
SHOULD
WORK
AS
ORIGINALLY
CONFIGURED
CONCLUSION
IM
NOT
SURE
THE
MODEM
WOULD
WORK
OK
IN
A
BASIC
SYSTEM
BUT
IT
CLEARLY
DOES
NOT
WORK
IN
A
MULTI
PORT
SYSTEM
LIKE
MINE
SINCE
MY
TIME
IS
WORTH
MORE
THAN
THE
AGGRAVATION
OR
THE
COST
OF
THE
MODEM
I
GAVE
IT
TO
A
LOCAL
CHARITABLE
ORGANIZATION
WITH
A
DESCRIPTION
OF
MY
PROBLEM
AND
ORDERED
A
PRACTICAL
PERIPHERALS
FROM
PC
CONNECTION
FOR
MORE
I
HAVE
A
SOLID
EXTERNAL
MODEM
BUILT
BY
A
COMPANY
I
KNOW
WILL
SUPPORT
THEIR
USERS
AND
SOLD
BY
A
COMPANY
BASED
ON
PERSONAL
EXPERIENCE
WILL
TREAT
ME
RIGHT
IF
THERE
IS
A
PROBLEM
I
SHOULD
HAVE
KNOWN
BETTER
