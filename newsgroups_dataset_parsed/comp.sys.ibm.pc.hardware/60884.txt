I
WANT
TO
USE
THIS
PROPOSED
BEAST
FOR
BASICALLY
FOUR
THINGS
EDITING
DOCUMENTS
USING
WORDPERFECT
UNDER
DOS
CREATING
GRAPHSANALYZING
DATA
USING
SIGMAPLOT
UNDER
DOS
EDITINGPLAYING
WITH
IMAGES
USING
ALDUS
PHOTOSTYLER
RUNNING
UNDER

THESE
IMAGES
CAN
BE
LARGE
SAY
X
USING
THE
PC
AS
AN
XTERMINAL
RUNNING
DESQVIEWX
AND
SUN
PCNFS
TALKING
TO
OUR
NETWORK
OF
SPARCSTATIONS
THIS
IS
WHERE
A
LOT
OF
THE
IMAGESDATA
COME
FROM
AND
IS
THE
MOST
DEMANDING
OF
THESE
TASKS
IVE
READ
READ
READ
PC
MAGAZINES
PERFORMED
BENCHMARKS
READ
THIS
NEWSGROUP
AND
DECIDED
THAT
A
NICE
SYSTEM
PRICEPERFORMANCE
WOULD
BE
CACHE
ISA
VLB
RAM
ATI
GRAPHICS
ULTRA
PRO
MEG
RAM
LOCAL
BUS
MONITOR
NI
ETHERLINK
III
MAXTOR
IDE
HARD
DRIVE
HOWEVER
THE
PARTS
DONT
FIT
OUR
LOCAL
RETAILER
APPARENTLY
PUT
ONE
OF
THESE
TOGETHER
ONLY
TO
DISCOVER
THAT
THE
ATI
CARD
WOULDNT
RUN
AT
SURPRISE
SURPRISE
ACTUALLY
AFTER
READING
THIS
GROUP
IM
SURPRISED
THAT
THEY
EVEN
HAVE
A
LOCAL
BUS
RUNNING
I
HAVE
A
CHOICE
NOW
BETWEEN
BASICALLY
THE
ABOVE
SYSTEM
BUT
WITH
A
WITH
ISA
AND
VLB
OR
A
WITH
EISA
AND
NO
VLB
AND
THUS
THE
NONLOCAL
BUS
VERSION
OF
THE
ATI
CARD
WHICH
IS
BETTER
KEEPING
IN
MIND
THAT
IM
PRIMARILY
INTERESTED
IN
THE
LAST
TWO
TASKS
HAVING
IN
MIND
THE
SIZE
OF
THE
IMAGES
MY
OPINION
IS
TO
GO
WITH
VLB
IT
HAS
MUCH
MORE
BANDWITH
THAT
EISA
WHICH
IN
FACT
CAN
BE
UTILIZED
BY
THE
CRAPHICS
CARD
I
HAVE
NOT
MADE
MEASURES
SO
SOMEONE
ELSE
MAY
SHARE
EXPERIENCE
ON
THAT
ALSO
THE
IS
FASTER
IN
THE
OPERATIONS
THAT
RUN
OFF
INTERNAL
CACHE
SLIGHTLY
SLOWER
OFF
THE
EXTERNAL
AND
ABOUT
THE
SAME
OFF
MEMORY
SO
MY
ADVICE
IS
THE
WERE
QUITE
HAPPY
WITH
THE
ATI
CARD
VERY
FAST
ONCE
THE
DATA
GETS
TO
IT
SLOW
REPAINTING
IMAGES
UNDER
PHOTOSTYLER
THAT
HAVE
MOVED
OFF
SCREEN
OR
BEEN
UNCOVERED
THERE
DOESNT
SEEM
TO
BE
ENOUGH
RAW
CPU
WHEN
RUNNING
DESQVIEWX
ITS
SLUGGISH
RUNNING
THE
LOCAL
WINDOW
MANAGER
ALSO
MANY
FUNCTIONS
UNDER
PHOTOSTYLER
TAKE
A
LONG
TIME
EVEN
WHEN
THE
IMAGES
FIT
ENTIRELY
IN
RAM
THERES
NOT
ENOUGH
MEMORY
IN
THE
SYSTEM
DESQVIEWX
AND
A
MEG
SMARTDRIVE
DONT
LEAVE
MUCH
ROOM
FOR
OTHER
APPS
PHOTOSTYLER
WILL
PAGE
TO
DISK
WITH
MEDIUM
SIZE
IMAGES
HAVE
YOU
TRIED
RUNNING
PHOTOSTYLER
WITHOUT
THE
CACHE
NO
NEED
TO
HAVE
PAGING
AND
CACHE
BOTH
WELL
YOU
MIGHT
ARGUE
THAT
THE
PAGING
IS
CACHED
MY
BELIEF
NO
MEASUREMENTS
IS
THAT
APPS
LEFT
WITH
MORE
MEMORY
WILL
MANAGE
IT
BETTER
THAN
SMARTDRVEXESYS
I
HAVE
PERFORMED
A
NUMBER
OF
BENCHMARKS
ON
THE
ETHERNET
TRANSFER
RATES
THIS
MACHINE
SUSTAINS
ONLY
OVER
ETHERNET
WHILE
OUR
SPARCS
SUSTAIN
ON
THE
SAME
NETWORK
GOING
TO
THE
BIT
VERSION
OF
THE
SMC
CARD
INCREASES
TRANSFER
RATES
TO
STILL
VERY
SLOW
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
MOVING
LARGE
IMAGES
IS
THERE
SUCH
A
THING
AS
A
LOCALBUS
ETHERNET
CARD
COMING
WILL
IT
MAKE
A
DIFFERENCE
IM
HOPING
SO
AND
LEANING
TOWARDS
THE
CHOICE
ABOVE
FOR
THAT
REASON
THE
BANDWIDTH
THEORETICAL
OF
ISA
IS
OVER
WHICH
IS
FAR
FROM
I
TRIED
MY
ISA
IDE
HARD
DRIVE
MAXTOR
AND
GOT
THE
SAME
RESULTS
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
ISA
BUS
SPEED
SO
I
GUESS
THAT
JUST
THE
CARDDRIVERS
COMBINATION
IS
LOUSY
ALSO
ARE
THERE
ON
THE
HORIZON
WHAT
ABOUT
THE
RUMORS
ARE
THAT
IF
ANY
IS
THE
MOST
LIKELY
CHIP
TO
COME
OUT
BUT
NOTE
THAT
IBM
IS
CLOSEST
TO
THE
TECHNOLOGY
AN
IT
WILL
ONLY
SELL
WHOLE
MOTHERBOARDS
SO
YOULL
HAVE
TO
UPGRADE
THE
MB
ANY
INFORMATION
IS
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
JUST
SOME
VIEW
NOT
MUCH
FIGURES
