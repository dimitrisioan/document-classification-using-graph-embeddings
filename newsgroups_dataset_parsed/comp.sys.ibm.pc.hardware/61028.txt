PLEASE
READ
I
HAVE
UPLOADED
THE
MOST
RECENT
WINDOWS
DRIVERS
FOR
THE
CIRRUS
CHIP
BASED
DISPLAY
CARDS
TO
THE
UPLOADS
DIRECTORY
AT
FTPCICAINDIANAEDU
FILE
IS
THEYRE
VERY
RECENT
I
DOWNLOADED
THEM
FROM
THE
CIRRUS
BBS
LAST
NIGHT
IF
YOU
ARE
UNABLE
TO
GET
THEM
THERE
EMAIL
ME
AND
MAYBE
I
CAN
UPLOAD
THEM
TO
SOME
OTHER
SITES
AS
WELL
I
HAVE
A
LOCAL
BUS
BASED
CARD
BITBLASTER
FROM
MICRON
BUT
I
THINK
THE
DRIVERS
WORK
WITH
ISA
CARDS
OR
AT
LEAST
INCLUDES
DRIVERS
FOR
THEM
I
FOUND
THE
NEW
DRIVERS
TO
BE
A
SIGNIFICANT
IMPROVEMENT
OVER
THE
VERSION
IMPROVING
MY
GRAPHIC
WINMARKS
BY
ABOUT
MILLION
TO
ALTHOUGH
THIS
COULD
BE
THE
RESULT
OF
INTENTIONAL
BENCHMARK
CHEATING
ON
CIRRUSS
PART
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
SO

MY

BITBLASTER
ITS
NO
VIPER
BUT
I
THINK
ITS
A
HELL
OF
A
DEAL
AT
ABOUT
A
THIRD
OF
THE
COST
OF
THE
ATI

AND
WHEN
COMPARED
TO
