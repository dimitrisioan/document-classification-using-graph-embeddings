buy
a
scsi
contoler
which
one
i
know
adaptec
is
good
but
they
are
kind
of
expensive
are
there
any
good
boards
in
the
region
i
want
it
to
be
compatible
with
and
unix
if
possible
also
i
have
seen
on
the
net
that
there
are
scsi
and
drives
is
this
true
does
the
adapter
need
to
be
the
same
as
the
drive
what
type
of
drive
is
the
quantum
i
have
tried
others
but
i
think
that
the
adaptec
is
best
value
for
money
i
have
an
adaptec
and
am
very
happy
with
it
connect
the
drive
to
the
adapter
via
a
scsi
cable
and
the
power
cable
do
i
have
to
worry
about
the
power
supply
i
think
i
have
watts
and
all
im
powering
are
two
floppies
and
the
seagate
drive
i
dont
think
you
can
mix
the
two
types
of
drive
unless
you
have
one
of
the
scsiide
cards
that
is
available
you
will
have
to
turn
your
ide
off
not
so
i
have
both
ide
and
an
in
the
same
box
and
can
use
both
disks
at
the
same
time
eg
ide
to
scsi
disk
copy
well
that
seems
to
be
all
is
