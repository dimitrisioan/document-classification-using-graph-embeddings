i
have
a
choice
now
between
basically
the
above
system
but
with
a
with
isa
and
vlb
or
a
with
eisa
and
no
vlb
and
thus
the
nonlocal
bus
version
of
the
ati
card
which
is
better
keeping
in
mind
that
im
primarily
interested
in
the
last
two
tasks
micronics
ami
came
out
with
eisavlb
motherboards
byte
mag
tests
indicate
that
vlb
is
faster
for
video
but
eisa
is
faster
for
disk
ops
so
ill
wait
for
to
hopefully
start
using
the
micronics
board
