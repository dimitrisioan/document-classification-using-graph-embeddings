MULTI
IO
CARD
WITH
UARTS
IS
IT
POSSIBLE
TO
BUY
A
SERIAL
IO
CARD
WITH
THE
UARTS
BUILT
IN
RATHER
THAN
HAVING
TO
BUY
THEM
SEPARATELY
AND
SOCKETING
THEM
IN
MY
CURRENT
IO
CARD
USES
CORRECT
NUMBER
THE
BRAINDEAD
ONES
ANYWAY
IT
ALSO
CONTROLS
TWO
FLOPPY
DRIVES
AND
TWO
IDE
HARD
DRIVES
IDEALLY
ID
LIKE
TO
GET
A
NEW
MULTI
IO
CARD
THAT
HAD
SERIAL
PORTS
WITH
AND
COULD
ALSO
CONTROL
ANOTHER
IDE
HDS
IT
WOULD
HAVE
TO
HAVE
CONFIGURABLE
ADDRESSES
FOR
BOTH
THE
SERIAL
PORTS
AND
THE
IDE
CONTROLLER
SO
IT
COULD
COEXIST
WITH
MY
EXISTING
CARD
DOES
SUCH
A
BEAST
EXIST
NOW
THE
HARD
PART
WHERE
