HERCULES
VLB
A
COUPLE
OF
MONTHS
AGO
I
TRIED
OUT
A
HERCULES
GRAPHITE
CARD
A
PRETTY
NICE
BOARD
FAIRLY
FAST
AND
SEEMED
QUITE
COMPATIBLE
EVEN
SEEMED
TO
HANDLE
THE
SVGA
MODES
I
HAVE
WHINED
ABOUT
HERE
ON
OCCASION
AT
THE
TIME
I
WAS
JUST
BUYING
A
VLB
SYSTEM
SO
AFTER
CHECKING
OUT
THE
CARD
I
SENT
IT
BACK
I
WANTED
A
VLB
CARD
AND
PURCHASED
A
FAHRENHEIT
VLB
CARD
THIS
CARD
IS
FAIRLY
FAST
WILL
DO
HZ
REFRESH
AT
BUT
IS
NOT
COMPATIBLE
WITH
MY
CDROMS
THE
SVGA
THING
I
THINK
I
HAVE
MERELY
CONJECTURED
THAT
IS
THE
CAUSE
OF
AN
OLD
GRAPHICS
BOARD
BEING
ABLE
TO
RUN
IN
A
HIGHER
RESOLUTION
WITH
THOSE
PROGRAMS
THAN
THE
MODERN
BOARDS
I
HAVE
TRIED
I
HAVE
NOT
GOTTEN
A
STRAIGHT
ANSWER
OUT
OF
ANYBODY
THE
MONITOR
I
AM
USING
IT
WITH
IS
A
MAGNAVOX
WHICH
ALSO
TOPS
OUT
AT
HZ
SO
ITS
REALLY
A
PRETTY
GOOD
MATCH
BUT
THAT
IS
FOR
MY
WIFE
I
JUST
PURCHASED
A
VIEWSONIC
FOR
MYSELF
AND
AM
LOOKING
FOR
A
GRAPHICS
CARD
TO
DRIVE
IT
I
WANT
REFRESH
AND
WOULD
REALLY
LIKE
IT
TO
HANDLE
MY
CDROMS
I
TRIED
THE
ORCHID
WHICH
DID
NEITHER
OF
THOSE
THINGS
THOUGH
ROBERT
AT
WIETEK
DID
SAY
THAT
THE
WAS
POSSIBLE
IF
I
MODIFED
THE
DRIVER
DATA
BASE
SO
MY
THOUGHTS
GO
BACK
TO
HERCULES
THEY
WERE
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
COMING
OUT
WITH
A
VLB
VERSION
OF
THE
GRAPHITE
AROUND
THE
END
OF
MARCH
I
HAVE
HEARD
PRECISELY
ZERO
ABOUT
IT
SINCE
THEN
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
IF
THE
CARD
WAS
ACTUALLY
RELEASED
AND
WHAT
CAPABILITIES
AND
PRICE
IT
HAS
ANY
INFO
WOULD
BE
MOST
APPRECIATED
