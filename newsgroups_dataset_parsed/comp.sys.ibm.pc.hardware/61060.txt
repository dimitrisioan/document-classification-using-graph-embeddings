im
arguing
with
the
phone
company
about
a
similar
problem
we
installed
a
second
phone
line
in
our
home
for
our
kids
and
whenever
one
of
them
is
on
their
line
the
modem
returns
no
dial
tone
on
its
line
when
we
pick
up
the
phone
and
listen
we
can
hear
my
kids
voices
bleed
through
whenever
we
can
hear
this
the
modem
wont
dial
even
though
the
dial
tone
is
loud
and
clear
through
the
modem
speaker
i
think
its
the
phone
companys
problem
but
they
say
they
cant
wont
correct
the
problemim
still
working
on
them
