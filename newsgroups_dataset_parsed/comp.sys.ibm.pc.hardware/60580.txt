REGARDING

THERE
ARE
A
OF
REASONS
I
AM
CONSIDERING
BTHIS
INCLUDING
QUICK

BMY
CONCERN
IS
THAT
WITHOUT
A
COMPLETE

TO
DIRECT
THE
BCOOLING
FLOW

DEVELOP

ELSEWHERE
IF
YOU
HAVE
AN
ADEQUATE
SUPPLY
OF

MOST
OFFICES
OR

HAVE

VENTILATION
YOU
CAN
GENERALLY
RUN

PERIODS
WITHOUT
A
PROBLEM
IM
TALKING
ABOUT
COMPLETELY
REMOVING
THE

NOT
JUST
LEAVING
THE
SLOTS
UNCOVERED
HOWEVER
THE
BIGGEST
REASON
YOU
HAVE
A

WITH
IS
RF
SHEILDING
OPERATING
A

MAY
CREATE
