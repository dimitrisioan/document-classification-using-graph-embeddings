WRITES
RECENTLY
I
HAVE
BEEN
GETTING
A
CMOS
CHECKSUM
ERROR
WHEN
I
FIRST
TURN
ON
MY
COMPUTER
IT
DOESNT
HAPPEN
EVERYTIME
I
TURN
IT
ON
NOR
CAN
I
PREDICT
WHEN
IT
IS
GOING
TO
HAPPEN
I
HAVE
AN
AMI
BIOS
AND
ALL
OF
THE
SETTING
ARE
LOST
FOR
EXAMPLE
THE
DRIVE
TYPES
AND
THE
PASSWORD
OPTIONS
HOWEVER
THE
DATE
AND
TIME
REMAIN
CORRECT
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
WHAT
CAN
BE
CAUSING
THIS
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
MOST
LIKELY
REASON
IS
THAT
YOUR
BACKUP
BATTERY
IS
FAILING
THIS
BATTERY
MAINTAINS
THE
CONTENTS
OF
THE
CMOS
MEMORY
WHEN
AC
POWER
IS
TURNED
OFF
AND
IF
THE
BATTERY
IS
FLAKEY
THEN
THE
CONTENTS
OF
THE
CMOS
WILL
BE
LOST
AND
THE
CHECKSUM
WILL
BE
WRONG
ALONG
WITH
MOST
OTHER
OF
THE
CMOS
DATA
TRY
REPLACING
THE
BATTERY
IF
HOWEVER
YOUR
PC
DOESNT
USE
A
BATTERY
BUT
A
LARGE
CAPACITOR
TO
POWER
THE
CMOS
YOU
SHOULD
CHECK
TO
SEE
IF
YOU
CAN
REPLACE
THE
CAPACITOR
WITH
A
MORE
NORMAL
LITHIUM
BATTERY
IF
THIS
ISNT
POSSIBLE
MAKE
SURE
YOU
LEAVE
YOUR
PC
ON
FOR
A
HALF
HOUR
OR
HOUR
EACH
DAY
THIS
WILL
KEEP
THE
CAPACITOR
CHARGED
ID
OPT
FOR
THE
BATTERY
CHANGE
THOUGH
ITS
ALSO
POSSIBLE
BUT
UNLIKELY
THAT
A
ROGUE
PROBLEM
OR
EVEN
A
VIRUS
IS
CORRUPTING
THE
CMOS
IF
YOUR
BATTERY
SEEMS
OKAY
GET
A
VIRUS
SCANNER
AND
CHECK
OUT
YOUR
SYSTEM
