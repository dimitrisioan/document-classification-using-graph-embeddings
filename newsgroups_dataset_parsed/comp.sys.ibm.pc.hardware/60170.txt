is

something
more
needed

blowing
a

system
xga

for

just
need
something
that
can
do
at
interlaced
just
tell
them
compatible
and
they
should
get
the
idea
for
the
get
what
you
like
i
prefer
multi
syncs
like
the
ibm
the
necs
or
even
a
fixed
frequency
monitor
like
my
home
viewsonic
i
like
the
multisyncs
because
its
easy
to
run
them
in
modes
like
colors
noninterlaced
or
at
higher
modes
like
dick
kaul
