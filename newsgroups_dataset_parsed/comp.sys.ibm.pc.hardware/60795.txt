THE
CMOS
CORRECTLY
THE
POWERS
PLUGGED

LEARNED
ABOUT
THE
MASTERSLAVE
RELATIONSHIP

DISCLAIMER
I
DONT
SPEAK
FOR
SURANET
AND
THEY
DONT
SPEAK
FOR
ME
IVE
BEEN
TOLD
BY
OUR
LOCAL
COMPUTER
GURU
THAT
YOU
CANT
DO
THIS
UNLESS
YOU
PERFORM
A
LOW
LEVEL
FORMAT
ON
YOUR
EXISTING
HARD
DRIVE
AND
SET
YOUR
SYSTEM
UP
FOR
TWO
HARD
DRIVES
FROM
THE
BEGINNING
I
TOOK
HIM
AT
HIS
WORD
AND
I
HAVE
NOT
TRIED
TO
FIND
OUT
ANY
MORE
ABOUT
IT
BECAUSE
IM
NOT
GOING
TO
BACK
EVERYTHING
UP
JUST
TO
ADD
ANOTHER
HDD
IF
ANYONE
KNOWS
FOR
SURE
WHAT
THE
SCOOP
IS
I
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
ALSO
THANKS
IN
ADVANCE
ALSO
BILL
WILLIS
DO
NOT
DO
A
LOW
LEVEL
FORMAT
ON
AN
IDE
DRIVE
UNLESS
YOU
HAVE
THE
EXECUTABLE
FOR
DOING
SO
SUPPLIED
BY
THE
MANUFACTURER
THESE
ARE
AVAILABLE
FROM
BBSS
OR
MAIL
BUT
THE
MAIL
VERSION
COSTS
A
NOMINAL
FEE
IN
ADDITION
TO
THE
MASTERSLAVE
JUMPER
ON
AN
IDE
DRIVE
THERE
IS
ALSO
ANOTHER
JUMPER
TO
INDICATE
WHETHER
A
SLAVE
IS
PRESENT
GET
IT
RIGHT
THE
CABLING
IS
NOT
AN
ISSUE
AS
LONG
AS
PIN
GOES
TO
PIN
GOES
TO
PIN
NO
TWISTING
OR
SWAPPING
ON
AN
IDE
CABLE
BE
SURE
OF
PIN
ON
ALL
THREE
COMPONENTS
DO
NOT
MAKE
ASSUMPTIONS
GUESSES
ARE
OK
BUT
ASSUMPTIONS
ARE
BAD
IF
THE
CABLE
AND
JUMPERS
ARE
CORRECT
AND
THE
CMOS
SETUP
IS
CORRECT
THEN
YOU
MAY
HAVE
TO
DO
AN
FDISK
FOLLOWED
BY
A
HIGH
LEVEL
FORMAT
I
HAVE
NEVER
PERSONALLY
FOUND
THIS
NECESARY
BUT
PERHAPS
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
GONE
WRONG
WITH
THE
DATA
ON
THE
DISKS
PROBABLY
NOT
BUT
I
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
PREDICAMENT
YOU
WILL
PROBABLY
THROW
SALT
OVER
YOUR
SHOULDERS
WEAR
FUNNY
CLOTHES
AND
DO
A
SPOOKY
SOUNDING
CHANT
WHILE
DANCING
AROUND
THE
ROOM
IF
SOMEONE
SAID
IT
MIGHT
HELP
GOOD
LUCK
