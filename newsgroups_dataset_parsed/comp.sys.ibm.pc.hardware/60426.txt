RE
IDE
VS
SCSI
IN
ARTICLE
THE
GREAT
RANDALLI
WRITES
CAN
ANYONE
EXPLAIN
IN
FAIRLY
SIMPLE
TERMS
WHY
IF
I
GET
I
MIGHT
NEED
AN
SCSI
CONTROLER
RATHER
THAN
AN
IDE
WILL
PERFORMANCE
SUFFER
THAT
MUCH
FOR
A
OR
SO
DRIVE
IF
I
DONT
HAVE
A
TAPE
DRIVE
OR
CDROM
ANY
HELP
WOULD
BE
APPRECIATED
RICHARD
RANDALL
THERE
IS
A
WAY
IN
WHICH
A
MULTITASKING
COMPUTER
ACTUALLY
GIVES
YOU
MORE
CPU
POWER
THEN
YOU
HAD
BEFORE
AND
THAT
IS
WITH
IO
OVERLAP
WITH
IO
OVERLAP
YOUR
CPU
CAN
CONTINUE
TO
THINK
WHILE
DISK
OPERATIONS
ARE
UNDERWAY
WHEREAS
WITHOUT
OVERLAP
YOUR
CPU
SITS
IDLY
WAITING
FOR
EACH
DISK
OPERATION
TO
FINISH
AND
DISK
OPERATIONS
TAKE
AN
ETERNITY
COMPARED
TO
A
FAST
CPU
SO
WHEN
YOUVE
GOT
MULTITASKING
YOU
WANT
TO
INCREASE
PERFORMANCE
BY
INCREASING
THE
AMOUNT
OF
OVERLAPPING
YOU
DO
ONE
WAY
IS
WITH
DMA
OR
BUS
MASTERING
EITHER
OF
THESE
MAKE
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
IO
DEVICES
TO
MOVE
THEIR
DATA
INTO
AND
OUT
OF
MEMORY
WITHOUT
INTERRUPTING
THE
CPU
THE
ALTERNATIVE
IS
FOR
THE
CPU
TO
MOVE
THE
DATA
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
SCSI
INTERFACE
CARDS
THAT
ALLOW
DMA
AND
BUS
MASTERING
IDE
HOWEVER
IS
DEFINED
BY
THE
STANDARD
AT
INTERFACE
CREATED
FOR
THE
IBM
PC
AT
WHICH
REQUIRES
THE
CPU
TO
MOVE
ALL
THE
DATA
BYTES
WITH
NO
DMA
