when
i
changed
my
motherboard
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
getting
ledspkrturboturboswitchhddklckrst
connectors
correctly
reconnected
for
example
turbo
switch
had
three
wires
and
the
motherboard
connection
only
two
pins
and
so
on
does
anyone
know
a
solution
to
this
do
i
need
to
rewire
the
connectors
or
what
is
the
best
way
to
approach
this
it
is
somewhat
frustrating
i
got
it
to
work
somehow
but
my
turbo
switch
doesnt
work
at
all
i
just
put
replaced
the
motherboard
in
a
system
and
had
similar
questions
my
cents
worth
the
speaker
connector
should
have
two
wires
going
to
the
speaker
a
speaker
being
a
coil
its
bidirectional
and
makes
no
difference
which
way
you
attach
turbo
switch
there
are
three
wires
to
control
how
you
want
turbo
to
become
active
with
the
switch
pushed
in
or
the
switch
out
i
think
the
middle
wire
is
common
use
an
ohm
meter
to
figure
out
which
wire
connects
with
the
common
wire
when
the
switch
is
pushed
in
and
which
two
wires
are
connected
when
the
switch
is
out
place
the
appropriate
two
wires
on
the
turbo
berg
connector
of
the
motherboard
leds
turbo
and
hd
leds
are
uni
directional
depending
which
way
the
wires
are
attached
the
led
will
not
light
on
my
ami
motherboard
if
the
turbo
switch
wires
are
not
attached
to
the
berg
connector
on
the
board
the
board
will
power
up
in
default
in
turbo
mode
if
your
motherboard
is
like
that
just
attace
the
led
wires
to
the
board
if
the
led
doesnt
light
power
off
reverse
the
connectors
and
try
again
it
should
work
if
it
does
then
attach
the
turbo
switch
to
the
board
hope
this
helps
