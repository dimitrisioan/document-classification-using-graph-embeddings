MICHAEL

REAMY
SUPPORT
WRITES
AND
THEY
TOO
SAID
THAT
THE
NANAO
WAS
THE
BEST
MONITOR
TO
GET
IF
YOU
HAD
THE
MONEY
BUT
THEY
ALSO
SAID
THAT
THE
MITSUBISHI
DIAMOND
PRO
IS
THE
NEXT
BEST
CHOICE
AND
THAT
IT
HAS
SUPERB
PICTURE
QUALITY
THIS
MONITOR
CAN
BE
HAD
FOR
AROUND
HAS
ANYONE
ACTUALLY
SEEN
ANY
OF
THESE
I
AM
RESPONSIBLE
FOR
CHOOSING
STANDARD
COMPONENTS
IN
MY
COMPANY
AND
AS
PART
OF
MY
REVIEW
I
GOT
THE
VIEWSONIC
MITSUBISHI
AND
NANAO
I
PICKED
THE
EVEN
THOUGH
IT
COSTS
MORE
THAN
THE
OTHER
TWO
CHOICES
BECAUSE
IT
HAS
A
THE
BEST
CLARITY
AND
TEXT
IS
NOT
FUZZY
AT
ALL
THE
VIEWSONIC
IS
THE
WORST
THE
MITSUBISHI
IS
MUCH
BETTER
BUT
THE
NANAO
BLOWS
BOTH
OF
THEM
OUT
OF
THE
WATER
I
DONT
UNDERSTAND
WHY
THE
NANAO
IS
SO
MUCH
BETTER
SINCE
ONE
WOULD
THINK
THAT
THE
MITSUBISHI
WITH
ITS
TRINITRON
TUBE
WOULD
BE
BETTER
I
CAN
ONLY
IMAGINE
THAT
THE
NANAO
MUST
BE
INCREDIBLE
IF
IT
IS
BETER
THAN
THE

THE
LIGHT
AT
THE
END
OF
THE
TUNNEL
MAY
BE
AN
ONCOMING
DRAGON
ONE
OF
THE
MONITORS
I
REVIEWED
FOR
THE
JUNE
ISSUE
OF
WINDOWS
MAGAZINE
WAS
THE
MITSUBISHI
I
ALSO
REVIEWED
A
NEW
NANAO
THE
WHICH
HAS
JUST
BEEN
RELEASED
LAST
YEAR
FOR
THE
MAY
ISSUE
OF
WINDOWS
I
REVIEWED
SEVERAL
MONITORS
INCLUDING
THE
NANAO
THERES
NO
QUESTION
THAT
THE
NANAO
MONITORS
ARE
THE
BEST
AVAILABLE
THIS
YEAR
JUST
AS
THEY
WERE
LAST
YEAR
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
MY
RANKING
OF
THE
BEST
IN
WINDOWS
AND
THE
RANKING
IN
WINDOWS
SOURCES
IS
DUE
MAINLY
TO
A
DIFFERENCE
IN
THE
TESTING
CRITERIA
AND
THE
SCORING
I
USED
DIFFERENT
TESTS
THAN
THEY
DID
AND
I
SCORED
DIFFERENTLY
THERES
NOTHING
WRONG
WITH
THE
MITSUBISHI
AND
IT
SCORED
VERY
HIGHLY
IN
MY
TESTS
BUT
IT
WAS
A
FEW
POINTS
SHY
OF
PERFECT
INCIDENTALLY
ONE
OF
THE
THINGS
EVERYONE
SHOULD
DO
WHEN
THEYRE
READING
REVIEWS
OF
ANY
PRODUCT
WHETHER
ITS
MONITORS
OR
MICE
IS
TO
READ
THE
CRITERIA
AND
METHODOLOGY
CAREFULLY
UNLESS
YOU
KNOW
HOW
THE
PRODUCT
TESTING
WAS
DONE
AND
ON
WHAT
THE
SCORES
ARE
BASED
YOU
CANT
POSSIBLY
KNOW
WHAT
THEY
REALLY
MEAN
JUST
SEEING
THAT
I
RANK
A
MONITOR
DIFFERENTLY
FROM
WINDOWS
SOURCES
IS
MEANINGLESS
WITHOUT
KNOWING
HOW
WE
DID
THE
RANKING
LIKEWISE
ITS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
TELL
WHETHER
A
MONITOR
WILL
MEET
YOUR
NEEDS
UNLESS
YOU
KNOW
HOW
WE
DID
THE
TESTING
AFTER
ALL
SOME
OF
WHAT
WE
DO
MAY
NOT
APPLY
TO
YOU
LIKEWISE
SOME
OF
WHAT
WE
DO
MAY
APPLY
MORE
CLOSELY
IN
ONE
REVIEW
THAN
IN
ANOTHER
YOU
CANT
ALWAYS
TELL
ANYTHING
FROM
READING
THE
OR
SO
WORDS
OF
COMMENTARY
WE
WRITE
IF
YOU
DONT
ALSO
UNDERSTAND
THE
SCORING
