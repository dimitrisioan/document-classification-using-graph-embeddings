i
am
looking
seriously
at
buying
a
dx
from
gateway
i
will
probably
buy
it
without
a
monitor
as
ive
heard
negative
stuff
about
gateway
monitors
ive
also
heard
its
tough
to
get
through
to
technical
support
im
seeking
opinions
on
whether
or
not
its
wise
to
go
ahead
based
on
criteria
such
as
price
warranty
service
general
ruggedness
of
the
system
reliability
of
the
machine
and
of
gateway
too
and
so
on
please
advise
thanks
in
advance
