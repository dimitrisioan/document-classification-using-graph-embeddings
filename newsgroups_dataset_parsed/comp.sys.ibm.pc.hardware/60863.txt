cdrom
drive
help
hello
all
i
recently
acquired
a
cdrom
drive
a
mitsumi
mfg
hey
it
was
free
im
quite
pleased
with
the
performance
but
it
seems
to
crash
a
lot
when
i
use
playcdexe
that
came
with
it
a
desqview
thoughts
this
mainly
happens
when
my
bbs
is
running
in
the
background
and
i
load
the
program
up
if
i
load
the
program
it
doesnt
crash
and
i
start
the
disk
stop
the
program
and
start
the
bbs
its
ok
but
otherwise
i
have
big
problems
ie
they
can
only
be
solved
with
a
cold
boot
if
anybody
can
mail
me
to
help
me
i
would
be
eternally
grateful
unfortunately
my
feed
to
this
group
is
a
little
unreliable
so
i
would
appreciate
if
you
could
mail
but
by
all
means
post
it
too
because
im
sure
somebody
else
would
like
to
know
