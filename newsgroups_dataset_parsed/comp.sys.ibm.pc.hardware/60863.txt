CDROM
DRIVE
HELP
HELLO
ALL
I
RECENTLY
ACQUIRED
A
CDROM
DRIVE
A
MITSUMI
MFG
HEY
IT
WAS
FREE
IM
QUITE
PLEASED
WITH
THE
PERFORMANCE
BUT
IT
SEEMS
TO
CRASH
A
LOT
WHEN
I
USE
PLAYCDEXE
THAT
CAME
WITH
IT
A
DESQVIEW
THOUGHTS
THIS
MAINLY
HAPPENS
WHEN
MY
BBS
IS
RUNNING
IN
THE
BACKGROUND
AND
I
LOAD
THE
PROGRAM
UP
IF
I
LOAD
THE
PROGRAM
IT
DOESNT
CRASH
AND
I
START
THE
DISK
STOP
THE
PROGRAM
AND
START
THE
BBS
ITS
OK
BUT
OTHERWISE
I
HAVE
BIG
PROBLEMS
IE
THEY
CAN
ONLY
BE
SOLVED
WITH
A
COLD
BOOT
IF
ANYBODY
CAN
MAIL
ME
TO
HELP
ME
I
WOULD
BE
ETERNALLY
GRATEFUL
UNFORTUNATELY
MY
FEED
TO
THIS
GROUP
IS
A
LITTLE
UNRELIABLE
SO
I
WOULD
APPRECIATE
IF
YOU
COULD
MAIL
BUT
BY
ALL
MEANS
POST
IT
TOO
BECAUSE
IM
SURE
SOMEBODY
ELSE
WOULD
LIKE
TO
KNOW
