GREG
SHAW
WRITES
WHY
DONT
YOU
START
WITH
THE
SPECSHEET
OF
THE
ISA
BUS
FIRST
YOU
CAN
QUOTE
SCSI
SPECS
TILL
YOURE
BLUE
IN
THE
FACE
BUT
IF
THEY
EXCEED
THE
ISA
BUS
CAPABILITY
THEN
WHATS
THE
POINT
WHO
SAID
ISA
WAS
NECESSARY
EISA
OR
VLB
ARE
THE
ONLY
INTERFACES
WORTH
INVESTING
THOUSANDS
OF
DOLLARS
EG
A
NEW
PCS
WORTH
OF
MONEY
IN
THEN
DONT
COMPLAIN
MAYBE
IT
WASNT
YOU
THAT
SCSI
WAS
SO
EXPENSIVE
ON
PCS
BECAUSE
ALL
WEVE
HAD
UNTIL
A
YEAR
OR
TWO
AGO
WAS
THE
ISA
BUS
IE
NO
ONE
BUYS
SCSI
FOR
ISA
BECAUSE
ISA
IS
SLOW
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
SCSI
ON
AN
ISA
BUS
IS
NOT
AN
AUTOMATIC
WINNER
WHEN
COMPARED
TO
IDE
YOU
DIDNT
READ
TO
CAREFULLY
VLBIDE
USES
THE
SAME
CONNECTION
MECHANISM
AS
STANDARD
IDE
IF
TRANSFER
RATE
IS
LIMITED
BY
IDE
WHETHER
ITS
INTERFACED
TO
ISA
EISA
OR
VLB
MATTERS
NOT
I
GET
DIFFERENT
TRANSFER
RATES
OUT
OF
MY
IDE
WHEN
I
CHANGE
MY
ISA
BUS
SPEED
ON
MINE
FOR
ONE
THING
SCSI
BLOWS
IDE
OUT
OF
THE
WATER
HANDS
DOWN
IF
IDE
HAS
BETTER
THROUGHPUT
WHY
ISNT
IT
USED
ON
WORKSTATIONS
AND
FILE
SERVERS
IDE
IS
JUST
A
VARIANT
OF
THE
OLD
IBM
MFM
AT
CONTROLLER
AT
LEAST
THATS
HOW
IT
LOOKS
FROM
A
SOFTWARE
POINT
OF
VIEW
IT
WAS
NEVER
MEANT
TO
BE
AN
ALLENCOMPASSING
PROTOCALSTANDARD
TO
BE
IMPLIMENTED
ACROSS
DIFFERENT
PLATFORMS
IS
THERE
ANY
ARGUMENT
THAT
IDE
CAN
OR
CANT
TRANSFER
DATA
FROM
THE
IDE
DRIVE
AT
LEAST
AS
FAST
AS
THE
DRIVE
IS
ABLE
TO
PROVIDE
THE
DATA
ARE
SCSI
VERSIONS
OF
IDE
DRIVES
ABLE
TO
DELIVER
HIGHER
SUSTAINED
TRANSFER
RATES
TO
THEIR
SCSI
INTERFACE
BECAUSE
OF
A
HIGHER
RPM
PLATTER
DIFFERENT
ARRANGEMENT
OF
HEADS
ETC
GIVEN
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
SCSI
USED
ONLY
AS
A
SINGLE
HARD
DRIVE
CONTROLLER
IS
IT
THEN
NECESSARY
TO
GET
A
SCSI
DRIVE
THAT
WILL
DO
AT
LEAST
MAYBE
MEGSSEC
FOR
THE
SCSI
CHOICE
TO
MAKE
ANY
SENCE
WHAT
DOES
A
MEG
MEGSSEC
SCSI
DRIVE
COST
NO
THATS
THE
NICE
THING
ON
A
MULTITASKING
OS
SCSI
CAN
USE
BOTH
DRIVES
AT
ONCE
IVE
GOT
UNIX
LOADED
ON
ONE
OF
MY
PCS
ALONG
WITH
WINDOGS
AND
THE
OS
CAN
ONLY
USE
ONE
OF
THE
TWO
IDE
DRIVES
AT
ONE
TIME
ITS
PRETTY
UGLY
IF
DATA
IS
GOING
FROM
ONE
DRIVE
TO
ANOTHER
AND
IF
SCSI
HAS
THE
ABILITY
TO
PERFORM
THAT
TRANSFER
WITHOUT
THE
DATA
HAVING
TO
GO
THROUGH
THE
CPU
OR
MAIN
MEMORY
THEN
YES
THAT
IS
THE
OPTIMAL
WAY
TO
DO
IT
AS
FAR
AS
I
KNOW
IDE
CANT
DO
THAT
BUT
WHEN
THE
CPU
WANTS
DATA
FROM
BOTH
DRIVES
DATA
TO
BE
STORED
IN
MAIN
MEMORY
ARE
YOU
SAYING
THAT
SCSI
CAN
GRAB
DATA
FROM
BOTH
DRIVES
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
AND
STORETRANSFER
THAT
DATA
TO
MAIN
MEMORY
ALSO
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
WORKING
OFF
IRQ
AND
DMA
CHANNEL
ON
AN
ISA
OR
WHATEVER
BUS
I
JUST
BOUGHT
AT
QUANTUM
FOR
MY
MAC
AT
HOME
I
PAID
FOR
IT
I
HAVENT
SEEN
IDE
DRIVES
CHEAPER
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
JUST
GOT
A
MAXTOR
MEG
IDE
DRIVE
FOR
THATS
MILLION
BYTES
OR
MEGABYTES
WITH
THE
BASIC
INTERFACE
HE
GETS
CLOSE
TO
MEGSEC
TRANSFER
ON
HIS
DOES
YOUR
FIGURE
INCLUDE
A
FEW
HUNDRED
FOR
SCSI
DRIVERS
NO
ACTUALLY
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
SCSI
BEING
EXPENSIVE
SIMPLY
BECAUSE
NOBODY
DID
A
COMMON
INTERFACE
FOR
THE
PC
IF
THEY
HAD
A
COMMON
READ
EASILY
IMPLEMENTED
METHOD
OF
ADDING
SCSI
TO
A
PC
LIKE
AS
IN
A
SUN
OR
MAC
THEN
YOUD
FIND
SCSI
THE
CONNECTION
MEDIUM
OF
CHOICE
SO
YOURE
SAYING
THAT
SCSI
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
THE
DEFAULT
INTERFACE
TYPE
CONSIDERING
THAT
THE
VAST
MAJORITY
OF
PCS
DONT
HAVE
CDROM
DRIVES
OR
TAPE
BACKUPS
OR
ETC
THAT
MOST
PCS
ONLY
HAVE
OR
HAD
HARD
DRIVE
AND
RUN
DOS
THAT
SCSI
HARD
DRIVES
COST
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
MFM
OR
RLL
DRIVES
AT
THE
TIME
AND
HOW
COMMON
WERE
SCSI
DRIVES
UNDER
MEGS
TO
YEARS
AGO
THERES
A
LOT
MORE
THAN
THE
LACK
OF
A
COMMON
INTERFACE
CARD
THAT
PREVENTED
SCSI
FROM
BECOMING
THE
CONNECTION
MEDIUM
OF
CHOICE
I
WONT
ARGUE
THAT
THE
SCSI
STANDARD
MAKES
FOR
A
GOOD
WELL
IMPLIMENTED
DATA
HIGHWAY
BUT
I
STILL
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHY
IT
INTRINSICALLY
BETTER
THAN
IDE
ON
AN
ISA
BUS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MULTITASKING
OSS
WHEN
MANAGING
DATA
FROM
A
SINGLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
ON
A
SINGLE
DRIVE
SCSI
IS
MORE
EXPENSIVE
BUT
ON
THAT
POINT
IS
IT
FASTER
THIS
IS
WHAT
ALL
THIS
IS
ABOUT
DO
YOU
GET
MORE
PERFORMANCE
FOR
THE
MONEY
FOR
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
THAT
WILL
ONLY
HAVE
A
SINGLE
HARD
DRIVE
IN
THEIR
SYSTEM
REGARDLESS
OF
THE
OS
WILL
THE
SCSI
CHOICE
REALLY
GIVE
THEM
MORE
PERFORMANCE
THAN
IDE
BUT
YOU
BOUGHT
YOUR
PC
FOR
EXPANDIBILITY
SO
YOUD
WANT
TO
ADD
MORE
DRIVES
OR
WHATEVER
TRUE
BUT
EXPANDIBILITY
CAN
ALSO
START
ON
THE
BUS
WHICH
MEANS
THE
OPTION
IS
THERE
FOR
CDROM
DRIVES
OR
TAPE
BACKUPS
THAT
RUN
OFF
THEIR
OWN
CARDS
YOU
CAN
ADD
MANY
DIFFERENT
TYPES
OF
DEVICES
AND
ACCESS
THEM
CONCURRENTLY
NO
ARGUMENT
THIS
IS
ALWAYS
HELD
UP
TO
THE
FIRST
TIME
SCSI
BUYER
AS
THE
BEST
REASON
BUT
HOW
MANY
SCSI
DEVICES
WILL
THE
FIRST
TIME
SCSI
BUYER
EVENTUALLY
ACQUIRE
AGAIN
DOES
IT
MAKE
SENSE
TO
GO
SCSI
FOR
A
SINGLE
HARD
DRIVE
SYSTEM
A
SCSI
DEVICE
WORKS
ON
MANY
DIFFERENT
MACHINES
I
HAVE
A
MAC
AND
A
PC
AT
HOME
AND
MOVING
HARD
DRIVES
BETWEEN
THEM
IS
VERY
NICE
WITH
SCSI
HOOK
THEM
UP
AND
AWAY
THEY
GO
WITH
ALL
THE
POSTINGS
ON
THE
SCSI
I
OR
II
SPECS
ARE
YOU
REALLY
SURE
THAT
PC
AND
APPLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVES
ARE
COMPATIBLE
AND
EVEN
IF
THEY
ARE
IS
THE
DATA
ACCESSIBLE
FROM
EITHER
MACHINE
IE
ARE
THERE
NO
FORMATTING
PARTITIONING
OR
FILE
TABLE
DIFFERENCES
IS
IT
REALLY
PLUGNPLAY
SCSI
DEVICES
WORK
TOGETHER
BETTER
THAN
IDE
DEVICES
FOR
INSTANCE
RECENTLY
I
ADDED
AN
OLDER
CONNOR
MEG
IDE
TO
A
MAXTOR
MEG
IDE
THE
CONNOR
MUST
BE
SETUP
AS
THE
SLAVE
IT
WILL
WORK
NO
OTHER
WAY
ON
SCSI
YOU
SET
THE
ADDRESS
CHECK
THE
TERMINATION
PLUG
IT
IN
AND
AWAY
IT
GOES
SO
THE
C
DRIVE
ON
THE
CONNOR
BECOMES
A
LOGICAL
D
DRIVE
TO
DOS
IS
THIS
REALLY
A
PROBLEM
I
HAVE
A
PROBLEM
WITH
IDES
MUTUAL
EXCLUSION
I
NOTICE
THAT
THE
TIME
IT
TAKES
TO
SWITCH
FROM
ACCESSING
DRIVE
C
TO
DRIVE
D
IS
QUITE
LONG
AS
COMPARED
TO
THE
TIME
IT
TAKES
TO
SWITCH
FROM
DRIVE
C
TO
D
ON
A
SCSI
SYSTEM
UNDER
A
MULTITASKING
OS
THIS
IS
VERY
NOTICABLE
AS
MANY
THINGS
CAN
BE
GOING
ON
AT
ONCE
AFTER
HAVING
TWO
IDE
DRIVES
IN
MY
SYSTEM
FOR
TEMPORARY
FILE
TRANSFERS
I
HAVE
NEVER
SEEN
ANY
DIFFERENCES
WHEN
SWITCHING
BETWEEN
DRIVES
NOR
HAVE
I
EVER
SEEN
ANY
DIFFERENCES
WHEN
TRANSFERING
FILES
BETWEEN
DRIVES
OR
TOFROM
THE
SAME
DRIVE
ONE
NEAT
THING
THAT
IVE
NOTICED
LATELY
A
FRINGE
BENEFIT
HAS
BEEN
THE
ABILITY
TO
ADD
OLDER
ALMOST
DEAD
DRIVES
AS
STORAGE
ON
A
SCSI
SYSTEM
WITH
LITTLE
PROBLEM
WEVE
GOT
A
BUNCH
OF
ALMOST
DEAD
MEG
DRIVES
THAT
IVE
ADDED
TO
MY
PC
IVE
NOW
GOT
THE
INTERFACE
FULL
BUT
IT
DOES
ALLOW
ME
TO
HAVE
MEG
DRIVES
MEG
DRIVE
TAPE
DRIVE
AND
MEG
DRIVE
ALL
ON
THE
SAME
CARD
THAT
IS
NICE
AS
LONG
AS
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
CAN
KEEP
UP
I
DO
BELIEVE
THAT
THERE
IS
THE
POSSIBILITY
FOR
UP
TO
IDE
DRIVES
ON
A
PC
SIMPLY
PUT
SCSI
IS
HANDIER
THAN
IDE
NO
MYSTERIOUS
JUMPERS
TO
FIGURE
OUT
BUT
WHAT
ABOUT
MYSTERIOUS
AND
EXPENSIVE
DRIVERS
TO
FIGURE
OUT
AT
LEAST
IDE
DOESNT
REQUIRE
DRIVERS
THAT
CONSUME
PRECIOUS
CONVENTIONAL
DOS
MEMORY
