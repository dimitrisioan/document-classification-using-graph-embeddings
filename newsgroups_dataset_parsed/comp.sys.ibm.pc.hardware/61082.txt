wrote
just
curious
why
floptical
drives
never
seemed
to
catch
on
remember
those
mb
disks
that
look
and
feel
like
floppies
these
drives
are
scsi
devices
and
can
read
and
write
both
kb
and
mb
disks
sounds
to
me
to
be
one
great
product
for
the
pc
market
are
the
prices
really
that
unaffordable
compared
to
cdroms
which
are
currently
not
rewritable
i
know
about
the
new
rewritable
cds
and
expect
sony
to
develop
the
first
mds
for
the
computer
my
question
is
why
isnt
there
any
substantial
interest
in
developing
the
flopticals
certainly
in
the
uk
the
flopticals
are
about
the
same
price
as
a
cheap
cdrom
now
you
seem
to
be
able
to
get
them
for
around
gbp
however
the
bigger
optical
drives
eg
are
much
more
expensive
around
the
gbp
mark
a
couple
of
questions
that
someone
may
be
able
to
answer
the
flopticals
are
they
direct
drop
in
replacements
for
a
floppy
or
do
they
need
driver
software
etc
ie
do
you
just
rip
out
the
floppy
drive
plug
the
same
cables
into
the
floptical
stick
in
a
floptidisk
and
hey
presto
you
have
a
floppy
this
sounds
far
too
easy
on
the
subject
of
sony
developing
mds
for
computers
i
have
reread
a
pcw
article
on
this
subject
and
there
it
says
that
sony
have
been
doing
optical
drives
for
other
people
for
some
time
and
may
be
about
to
do
a
product
themselves
from
the
article
it
seems
that
the
audio
md
format
is
a
byproduct
of
their
computer
storage
work
the
md
mechanism
is
identical
to
their
mo
computer
optical
drives
a
sony
spokesman
was
quoted
as
saying
that
a
md
disk
would
hold
about
of
data
though
he
refused
to
comment
on
any
possibility
of
this
being
productized
the
article
said
that
one
of
the
problems
holding
back
development
in
this
area
was
lack
of
sensible
standards
plus
there
are
at
least
distinct
optical
storage
mechanisms
around
at
present
given
that
it
probably
needs
mds
being
used
as
a
distribution
medium
to
get
it
into
the
market
and
since
this
has
already
been
cornered
by
cds
it
probably
needs
someone
to
come
in
with
a
very
strong
marketting
lead
to
get
mds
accepted
