bios
upgrade
on
compaq

howdy
i
recently
upgraded
the
original
bios
in
a
compaq
deskpro
with
a
phoenix
replacement
bios
in
order
to
support
an
ide
hard
drive
and
a
highdensity
floppy
i
assumed
that
this
would
be
a
plugandplay
procedure
but
i
have
encountered
a
problem
that
phoenix
and
compaq
are
unwilling
to
admit
responsibilty
for
and
i
was
wondering
if
anyone
else
had
seen
it
everything
is
hunkydory
except
the
floppy
which
will
read
but
not
write
diskettes
any
write
attempt
merely
corrupts
both
fats
i
have
tried
everything
i
can
think
of
any
takers
