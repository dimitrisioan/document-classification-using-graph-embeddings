WBARNESSURANET
BILL
BARNES
WRITES
BASICALLY
IM
LOOKING
FOR
A
SVGA
NONINTERLACED
MONITOR
THE
NEC
IS
THE
ONE
MOST
OF
THE
COMPUTER
MAGS
USE
AS
THEIR
STANDARD
AND
FROM
WHAT
IVE
SEEN
AND
HEARD
IT
LOOKS
PRETTY
GOOD
BUT
ITS
A
BIT
EXPENSIVE
BUCKS
IS
THE
BEST
DEAL
IVE
SEEN
SO
I
THOUGHT
PERHAPS
I
MIGHT
FIND
SOMETHING
AS
GOOD
FOR
LESS
ANY
RECOMMENDATIONS
I
ALSO
THOUGHT
ABOUT
THE
NEC
WHICH
HAS
THE
SAME
SPECS
AS
THE
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
SCAN
FREQUENCY
WHICH
IS
MORE
LIMITED
ANYBODY
HAVE
ANY
COMMENTS
ON
THIS
ONE
WOULD
IT
WORK
WITH
I
BELIEVE
THAT
NEC
IS
REPLACING
THE
AND
WITH
AND
MODELS
REPORTEDLY
BEING
RELEASED
AT
THE
END
OF
THIS
MONTH
IM
WAITING
FOR
A
THE
MAIN
DIFFERENCE
BEING
A
YEAR
WARRANTY
AND
HIGHER
REFRESH
RATES
AT
THE
HIGHER
RESOLUTIONS
IT
SOUNDED
FROM
A
PC
MAGAZINE
NOTE
THAT
THE
WAS
BEING
BOOSTED
IN
A
NUMBER
OF
WAYS
CALL
THE
NEC
NUMBER
AND
HAVE
THEM

I
HAVE
BEEN
USING
A
NEC
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
NOW
SEVERAL
OTHERS
HERE
ALSO
HAVE
THIS
MONITOR
WE
HAVE
HAD
NO
PROBLEMS
PERSONALLY
I
WOULD
SPEND
EXTRA
MONEY
FOR
THIS
MONITOR
AND
SACRIFICE
OTHER
FEATURES
ON
A
PC
SUCH
AS
MHZ
VIZ
MHZ
BASED
ON
THE
COMMENTS
OF
OTHERS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
VIEW
THE
VS
THE
SERIES
ON
A
PC
RUNNING
WINDOWS
AT
THE
REFRESH
RATE
APPEARS
OK
FOR
ME
BUT
YOU
MIGHT
FEEL
DIFFERENTLY
FINALLY
SPEAKING
OF
SPENDING
MONEY
WITH
THE
SIZE
OF
TODAYS
FILES
ETC
A
TAPE
BACKUP
IS
CERTAINLY
WORTH
RECENTLY
I
SET
UP
A
FRIENDS
PC
AND
VESA
LOCAL
BUS
THE
REDRAW
TIME
FOR
A
GRAPHICS
PROGRAM
WAS
ONLY
A
FACTOR
OF
FASTER
WHICH
I
DOUBT
WARRANTS
THE
EXTRA
COST
