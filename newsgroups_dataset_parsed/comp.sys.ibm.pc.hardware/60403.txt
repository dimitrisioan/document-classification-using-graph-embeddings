I
HAVE
A
DRIVE
AS
DRIVE
A
HOW
CAN
I
MAKE
THE
SYSTEM
BOOT
FROM
MY
B
DRIVE
OPTIMALLY
THE
COMPUTER
WOULD
BE
ABLE
TO
BOOT
FROM
EITHER
A
OR
B
CHECKING
THEM
IN
ORDER
FOR
A
BOOTABLE
DISK
BUT
IF
I
HAVE
TO
SWITCH
CABLES
AROUND
AND
SIMPLY
SWITCH
THE
DRIVES
SO
THAT
IT
CANT
BOOT
DISKS
THATS
OK
ALSO
BOOTB
WONT
DO
THE
TRICK
FOR
ME
THANKS
DAVEBO
WE
HAD
THE
SAME
ISSUE
PLAGUE
US
FOR
MONTHS
ON
OUR
GATEWAY
I
FINALLY
GOT
TIRED
OF
IT
SO
I
PERMANENTLY
INTERCHANGED
THE
DRIVES
THE
ONLY
REASON
I
DIDNT
DO
IT
IN
THE
FIRST
PLACE
WAS
BECAUSE
I
HAD
SEVERAL
BOOTABLE
AND
SOME
BASED
INSTALL
DISKS
WHICH
EXPECTED
THE
A
DRIVE
I
ORDER
ALL
NEW
SOFTWARE
AND
UPGRADES
TO
BE
AND
THE
NUMBER
OF
STUPID
INSTALL
PROGRAMS
THAT
CANT
HANDLE
AN
ALTERNATE
DRIVE
ARE
DECLINING
WITH
TIME
THE
ONES
I
HAD
ARE
NOW
UPGRADED
AND
AS
FOR
THE
BOOTABLE
I
JUST
CUT
REPLACEMENTS
IF
SWITCHING
THE
DRIVES
IS
NOT
AN
OPTION
YOU
MIGHT
BE
ABLE
TO
WIRE
UP
A
DRIVE
SWITCH
TO
YOUR
COMPUTER
CHASIS
I
HAVENT
TRIED
IT
BUT
I
THINK
IT
WOULD
WORK
AS
LONG
AS
IT
IS
WIRED
CAREFULLY
I
DID
THIS
I
USE
A
RELAY
RADIO
SHACK
INSTEAD
OF
A
HUGE
SWITCH
THIS
WAY
IF
THE
RELAY
BREAKS
MY
DRIVES
WILL
STILL
WORK
IT
WORKS
FINE
BUT
YOU
MAY
STILL
NEED
TO
CHANGE
THE
CMOS
BEFORE
THE
DRIVE
SWITCH
WILL
WORK
CORRECTLY
FOR
SOME
PROGRAMS
