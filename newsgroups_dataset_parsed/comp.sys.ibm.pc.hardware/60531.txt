HELP
WITH
DTK
IO
PLUS
II
CARD
NEEDED
I
AM
TRYING
TO
HELP
A
FRIEND
OF
MINE
GET
THE
SECOND
SERIAL
PORT
ON
HIS
DTK
IO
PLUS
II
CARD
WORKING
AND
IT
DOES
NOT
WANT
TO
COOPERATE
THE
DOCUMENTATION
IS
NO
HELP
AT
ALL
AS
AN
EXAMPLE
IT
SAYS
THE
SERIAL
PORT
CAN
BE
CHANGED
TO
FROM
BY
MOVING
JUMPERS
BUT
DOES
NOT
SAY
WHAT
JUMPERS
TO
MOVE
THERE
ARE
BANKS
OF
JUMPERS
THE
FIRST
ONE
IS
LABELED
AS
FOLLOWS
G
THE
SECOND
BANK
IS
LABELED
IRQ
AND
HAS
THE
FOLLOWING
LABELS
I
HAVE
DETERMINED
THAT
THE
JUMPERS
TELL
IT
TO
ADDRESS
THE
FIRST
SERIAL
PORT
AS
OR
THE
JUMPERS
TELL
IT
TO
USE
THE
PRINTER
PORT
AS
OR
I
AM
GUESSING
THAT
THE
G
ENABLES
THE
GAME
PORT
AND
THE
SHOULD
ENABLE
THE
SECOND
SERIAL
PORT
BUT
I
CANT
GET
IT
TO
WORK
I
HAVE
TRIED
NUMEROUS
SETTING
ON
THE
IRQ
BANK
WITHOUT
SUCCESS
I
ASSUME
THAT
THIS
BANK
MUST
TELL
THE
CARD
WHICH
IRQS
TO
USE
FOR
BOTH
PORTS
BUT
I
DONT
KNOW
HOW
ANY
SUGGESTIONS
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
