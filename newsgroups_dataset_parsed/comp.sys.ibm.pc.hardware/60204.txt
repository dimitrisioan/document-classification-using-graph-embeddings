re
joystick
suggestions
it
depends
on
what
youd
like
your
joystick
for
ive
seen
gravis
joysticks
at
radio
shack
they
seemed
flimsy
and
didnt
fit
well
in
my
hand
i
have
heard
on
csipgames
that
they
dont
last
well
less
than
a
year
on
flightsims
one
redeeming
feature
does
seem
to
be
the
ability
to
adjust
the
tension
of
the
stick
i
recently
purchased
a
ch
flightstick
there
arent
any
suction
cups
and
no
tension
adjusters
but
otherwise
it
seems
to
be
an
excellent
joystick
im
currently
using
it
for
the
wing
commander
series
and
red
baron
works
quite
well
the
large
base
does
not
require
a
steadying
hand
and
so
leaves
it
free
the
buttons
provide
good
tactile
response
you
can
hear
and
feel
them
well
there
are
other
models
made
by
ch
that
can
go
up
or
down
in
features
for
price
comparison
gravis
analogue
joysticks
sell
for
here
compared
to
the
i
paid
for
a
ch
flightstick
i
think
the
extra
is
worth
it
just
in
feel
best
thing
to
do
is
to
ask
a
salesperson
to
let
you
try
them
out
or
at
least
feel
it
before
you
buy
just
another
note
analogue
joysticks
are
best
for
flightsims
or
something
that
needs
sensitive
touch
if
youre
only
playing
games
such
as
castle
wolfenstein
or
some
other
game
that
only
uses
digital
input
ie
only
up
down
left
etc
instead
of
how
much
right
you
might
want
to
look
into
a
gravis
gamepad
they
look
like
a
nintendo
control
pad
but
i
dont
know
much
beyond
that
