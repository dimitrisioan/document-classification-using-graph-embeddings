WRITES
SPEAKING
OF
CPU
FANS
MANY
USE
CLIPS
MAKE
SURE
YOU
USE
HEAT
SINK
GREASE
OR
HEAT
TRANSFERING
TAPE
OR
YOU
WILL
HAVE
WASTED
YOUR
MONEY
DO
THESE
CPU
FANS
ALSO
HAVE
HEAT
SINKS
DO
YOU
RECOMMEND
USING
BOTH
ON
THE
SAME
CHIP
IE
HEAT
SINK
SANDWICHED
BETWEEN
CPU
AND
FAN
IF
WE
ARE
JUST
TALKING
ABOUT
A
CPU
FAN
BLOWING
DIRECTLY
ON
THE
CPU
CHIP
I
CANT
SEE
HOW
HEAT
SINK
GREASE
IS
NECESSARY
OR

DESIREABLE
