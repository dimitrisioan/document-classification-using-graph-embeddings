RE
IDE
CABLE
WROTE
I
JUST
BOUGHT
A
NEW
IDE
HARD
DRIVE
FOR
MY
SYSTEM
TO
GO
WITH
THE
ONE
I
ALREADY
HAD
MY
PROBLEM
IS
THIS
MY
SYSTEM
ONLY
HAD
A
IDE
CABLE
FOR
ONE
DRIVE
SO
I
HAD
TO
BUY
CABLE
WITH
TWO
DRIVE
CONNECTORS
ON
IT
AND
CONSEQUENTLY
HAVE
TO
SWITCH
CABLES
THE
PROBLEM
IS
THE
NEW
HARD
DRIVES
MANUAL
REFERS
TO
MATCHING
PIN
ON
THE
CABLE
WITH
BOTH
PIN
ON
THE
DRIVE
ITSELF
AND
PIN
ON
THE
IDE
CARD
BUT
FOR
THE
LIFE
OF
ME
I
CANNOT
FIGURE
OUT
HOW
TO
TELL
WHICH
WAY
TO
PLUG
IN
THE
CABLE
TO
ALIGN
THESE
MOST
IDE
DRIVES
THAT
I
HAVE
DEALT
WITH
HAVE
HAD
PIN
LABELED
ON
THE
PRINTED
CIRCUIT
BOARD
THIS
IS
SUFFICIENT
TO
DETERMINE
WHICH
SIDE
IS
WHICH
IF
YOUR
IDE
DRIVE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
A
LABEL
THEN
YOU
CAN
LOOK
FOR
A
POLARIZATION
NOTCH
IN
THE
RECEPTACLE
THE
CONNECTOR
ON
THE
DRIVE
WITH
THE
PINS
IF
THE
RECEPTACLE
IS
CENTER
POLARIZED
THAT
IS
IT
HAS
ONE
RECTANGULAR
NOTCH
ABOUT
MM
WIDE
POSITIONED
IN
THE
CENTER
OF
ONE
SIDE
THEN
YOU
CAN
IDENTIFY
PIN
AS
FOLLOWS
LOOK
INTO
THE
PINS
WITH
THE
NOTCH
AT
THE
TOP
PIN
IS
AT
THE
TOP
RIGHT
ON
ALL
DRIVES
I
HAVE
SEEN
THIS
IS
TOWARD
THE
POWER
CONNECTOR
AS
FOR
WHICH
PIN
IS
PIN
ON
THE
CONTROLLER
WELL
YOU
CAN
USE
THE
SAME
CRITERIA
BUT
LOOK
HARD
FOR
THE
LABELLING
OF
ANY
PIN
ONCE
YOU
KNOW
WHICH
END
PIN
ARE
ON
OR
PINS
THE
OPOSITE
END
THEN
YOU
ARE
ALL
SET
ALL
YOU
NEED
TO
DO
IS
KEEP
THE
PIN
END
CONNECTED
TO
THE
PIN
END
YOU
DONT
EVEN
HAVE
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
CABLE
ITSELF
JUST
TRACE
THE
PIN
SIDE
OF
THE
CABLE
THROUGH
USUALLY
THE
PIN
OF
THE
CABLE
IS
IDENTIFIED
BY
A
DIFFERENT
COLOR
RED
USUALLY
BUT
BEWARE
MANY
CABLE
MAKERS
ARE
NOT
VERY
CAREFUL
ABOUT
THIS
I
HAVE
SEEN
CABLES
WITH
PIN
BEING
THE
ONE
MARKED
RED
OF
COURSE
WITH
NONPOLARIZED
CONNECTORS
THIS
DOESNT
MATTER
YOU
CAN
PLUG
THE
CABLE
IN
EITHER
WAY
AND
YOU
DECIDE
WHICH
SIDE
IS
PIN
SECONDLY
THE
CABLE
HAS
LIKE
A
CONNECTOR
AT
TWO
ENDS
AND
ONE
BETWEEN
THEM
I
FIGURE
ONE
END
GOES
IN
THE
CONTROLER
AND
THEN
THE
OTHER
TWO
GO
INTO
THE
DRIVES
DOES
IT
MATTER
WHICH
I
PLUG
INTO
THE
MASTER
DRIVE
AND
WHICH
INTO
THE
SLAVE
ANY
HELP
APPRECIATED
THANKS
IT
DOESNT
MATTER
WHAT
GETS
PLUGGED
WHERE
BUT
IT
DOES
MATTER
HOW
THE
DRIVES
ARE
JUMPERED
THERE
WILL
BE
AMONGST
OTHER
OPTIONS
TWO
JUMPERS
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
CONCERNED
WITH
ON
BOTH
DRIVES
ONE
JUMPER
WILL
SELECT
WHETHER
THE
DRIVE
IS
THE
SLAVE
OR
THE
MASTER
IF
IT
IS
THE
MASTER
THEN
A
SECOND
JUMPER
SELECTS
WHETHER
OR
NOT
A
SLAVE
IS
PRESENT
YOU
WILL
HAVE
TO
CONSULT
THE
DOCUEMENTATION
THAT
CAME
WITH
YOU
DRIVES
IF
YOU
DO
NOT
HAVE
DOCUEMENTATION
THEN
JUST
CALL
THE
MANUFACTURERS
HOTLINE
NUMBER
OR
FAX
NUMBER
IF
THEY
HAVE
ONE
THIS
KIND
OF
INFORMATION
IS
ROUTINELY
NEEDED
BY
PEOPLE
JUST
LIKE
YOURSELF
THEY
WILL
FAX
YOU
COMPLETE
INFO
ABOUT
THE
JUMPERS
IF
YOU
DONT
HAVE
CONVENIENT
ACCESS
TO
A
FAX
MACHINE
THEN
YOU
CAN
USUALLY
GET
VOICE
HELP
OR
POST
THE
SPECIFIC
QUESTION
TO
THIS
GROUP
I
PROBABLY
WONT
BE
ABLE
TO
HELP
YOU
GOOD
LUCK
