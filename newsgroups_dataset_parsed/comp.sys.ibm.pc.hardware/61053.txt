perhaps
you
should
try
nicfunetfi
instead
of
funetfi
another
possibility
is
that
you
did
not
give
your
email
address
as
password
for
the
anonymous
account
if
you
that
you
see
following
message
entered
an
invalidinpropable
password
and
are

accessing
subset
of

please
read
readme
for
more
information
have
special

this
can
happen
if
your
terminal
emulator
does
not
generate
the
character
as
you
think
it
is
hard
to
see
since
passwords
are
not
echoed
