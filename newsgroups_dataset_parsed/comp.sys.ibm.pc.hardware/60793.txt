has
anyone
successfully
put
both
scsi
and
ide
hard
drives
on
the
same
system
i
would
like
to
know
as
well
since
i
just
bought
a
seagate
ide
drive
and
want
to
add
it
to
my
computer
a
fouryearold
gateway
which
currently
has
an
seagate
scsi
drive
the
scsi
controller
is
such
that
the
docs
told
me
not
to
specify
it
in
the
cmos
setup
ie
both
hard
drive
settings
are
listed
as
not
installed
and
apparently
the
scsi
controller
works
its
wonders
i
wondering
if
this
is
a
problem
also
i
remember
how
when
i
helped
my
cousin
install
his
second
ide
drive
we
had
to
define
a
masterslave
relationship
for
them
do
i
need
to
do
something
similar
here
i
am
particularly
interested
in
having
the
scsi
as
the
boot
drive
same
here
any
help
would
be
appreciated
since
i
intend
to
install
this
drive
asap
id
like
to
know
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
before
i
start
