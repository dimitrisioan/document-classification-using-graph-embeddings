BECAUSE
OF
SOME
CONTRACT
IBM
IS
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
SELL
ITS
CHIPS
TO
THIRD
PARTIES
SO
THESE
CHIPS
ARE
UNLIKELY
TO
BECOME
AVAILABLE
IN
ANY
NONIBM
MACHINES
I
SAW
IN
THIS
MONTHS
PC
OR
PC
WORLD
AN
AD
FOR
COMPUTERS
USING
IBMS
SO
I
DONT
THINK
IBM
IS
RESTRICTED
IN
SELLING
THEIR
CHIPS
AT
LEAST
NOT
ANYMORE
A
CLOCKTRIPLED
EVEN
WITHOUT
COPROCESSOR
WOULD
BE
GREAT
ESPECIALLY
WITH
ONBOARD
CACHE
MAKE
IT
PINCOMPATIBLE
AND
YOU
HAVE
THE
