RE
IDE
VS
SCSI

BGRUBBDANTENMSUEDU
GRUBB
WRITES
POINT
OF
VIEW
WHY
DOES
SCSI
HAVE
AN
ADVANTAGE
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MULTI
TASKING
DATA
IS
DATA
AND
IT
COULD
BE
ANYWHERE
ON
THE
DRIVE
CAN
SCSI
FIND
IT
FASTER
CAN
IT
GET
IT
OFF
THE
DRIVE
AND
INTO
THE
COMPUTER
FASTER
DOES
IT
HAVE
A
BETTER
CACHE
SYSTEM
I
THOUGHT
SCSI
WAS
GOOD
AT
MANAGING
A
DATA
BUS
WHEN
MULTIPLE
DEVICES
ARE
ATTACHED
IF
WE
ARE
ONLY
TALKING
ABOUT
A
SINGLE
DRIVE
EXPLAIN
WHY
SCSI
IS
INHERENTLY
FASTER
AT
MANAGING
DATA
FROM
A
HARD
DRIVE
IDE
INTEGRATED
DEVICE
ELECTRONICS
CURRENTLY
THE
MOST
COMMON
STANDARD
AND
IS
MAINLY
USED
FOR
MEDIUM
SIZED
DRIVES
CAN
HAVE
MORE
THAN
ONE
HARD
DRIVE
ASYNCHRONOUS
TRANSFER
MAX
WHY
DONT
YOU
START
WITH
THE
SPECSHEET
OF
THE
ISA
BUS
FIRST
YOU
CAN
QUOTE
SCSI
SPECS
TILL
YOURE
BLUE
IN
THE
FACE
BUT
IF
THEY
EXCEED
THE
ISA
BUS
CAPABILITY
THEN
WHATS
THE
POINT
WHO
SAYS
IDE
IS
LIMITED
TO
MEGSSEC
WHAT
ABOUT
VLBIDE
DOES
ANYONE
KNOW
HOW
THEY
PERFORM
SO
AT
ITS
LOWEST
SETTING
INTERFACE
IN
ASYNCHRONOUS
MODE
AVERAGES
THE
THROUGH
PUT
MAXIMUM
OF
IDE
IN
ASYNCHRONOUS
MODE
IN
FULL
MODE
IT
BLOWS
POOR
IDE
OUT
THE
WINDOW
DOWN
THE
STREET
AND
INTO
THE
GARBAGE
CAN
AS
IMPLIMENTED
ON
WHAT
SYSTEM
THE
PROBLEM
BECOMES
CAN
THE
DRIVE
MECHANISIM
KEEP
UP
WITH
THOSE
THROUGH
PUT
RATES
AND
THAT
IS
WHERE
THE
BOTTLENECK
AND
COST
OF
COMES
FROM
NOT
THE
INTERFACE
ITSELF
BUT
MORE
AND
MORE
FROM
DRIVE
MECHANISIMS
TO
USE
THE
THROUGH
PUT
GIVEN
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
SCSI
USED
ONLY
AS
A
SINGLE
HARD
DRIVE
CONTROLLER
IS
IT
THEN
NECESSARY
TO
GET
A
SCSI
DRIVE
THAT
WILL
DO
AT
LEAST
MAYBE
MEGSSEC
FOR
THE
SCSI
CHOICE
TO
MAKE
ANY
SENCE
WHAT
DOES
A
MEG
MEGSSEC
SCSI
DRIVE
COST
THE
COST
OF
SCSI
INTERFACE
IS
A
SELF
FULLILING
PROPHISY
FEW
PEOPLE
BUY
SCSI
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SO
EXPENCIVE
FOR
THE
PC
WHICH
IN
TURN
CONVICES
MAKES
THAT
MASS
PRODUCING
SCSI
WHICH
WOULD
REDUCE
ITS
COST
IS
UNWARENTED
AND
SO
SCSI
IS
EXPENCIVE
THAT
IS
THE
EFFECT
OF
THE
RULE
OF
SCALE
THE
MORE
ITEMS
SOLD
THE
LESS
EACH
ITEM
HAS
TO
BARE
THE
BRUNT
THE
COST
OF
MANUFACTURE
AND
SO
THE
LESS
EACH
ITEM
HAS
TO
COST
THE
ORIGINAL
CGA
CART
BACK
IN
WAS
I
THINK
THE
ORIGINAL
EGA
CARD
OR
PGA
WAS
SCSI
HAS
STOOD
RELATIVELY
ALONE
IN
NOT
COMING
DOWN
IN
PRICE
MAINLY
BECAUSE
WERE
TALKING
ABOUT
PCS
AND
NOT
SUNS
OR
SPARC
OR
SGI
OR
NAME
YOUR
FAVORITE
UNIX
WORKSTATION
THAT
IS
AFTER
MILLIONS
OF
PC
BUYING
DECISIONS
OVER
THE
YEARS
SCSI
HAS
HAD
PLENTY
OF
TIME
TO
COME
DOWN
IN
PRICE
I
WONT
ARGUE
THAT
THE
SCSI
STANDARD
MAKES
FOR
A
GOOD
WELL
IMPLIMENTED
DATA
HIGHWAY
BUT
I
STILL
WANT
TO
KNOW
WHY
IT
INTRINSICALLY
BETTER
THAN
IDE
ON
AN
ISA
BUS
WHEN
IT
COMES
TO
MULTITASKING
OSS
WHEN
MANAGING
DATA
FROM
A
SINGLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
