a
friend
of
mine
recently
got
such
a
serial
card
ill
have
to
ask
him
to
verify
the
details
but
as
i
recall
he
paid
its
made
by
stb
it
has
or
was
it
ports
and
it
supports
the
at
irqs
in
addition
to
the
convention
ones
im
sure
of
the
last
because
he
had
trouble
finding
comm
software
that
would
allow
him
to
override
the
standard
irq
assignments
unfortunately
there
a
lot
of
such
software
i
also
find
it
to
be
the
case
that
the
majority
of
the
software
that
is
bad
in
this
regard
is
commercial
software
way
too
many
commercial
packages
are
very
poorly
written
but
then
most
of
the
programs
in
msdos
are
crap
such
as
the
print
command
tsr
that
locks
up
your
system
for
long
periods
of
time
when
the
printer
is
full
instead
of
trying
every
clock
tick
back
to
comm
software
i
find
success
with
telix
my
at
works
