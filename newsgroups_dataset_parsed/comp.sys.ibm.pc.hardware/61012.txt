how
hot
should
the
cpu
in
a
dx
machine
be
currently
it
gets
so
hot
that
i
can
not
hold
a
finger
on
it
for
more
than
s
i
keep
a
big
fan
blowing
on
it
but
am
considering
using
a
heat
sink
any
advice
dont
hold
your
finger
on
it
when
cooking
with
it
use
a
very
small
pan
and
be
sure
to
not
spill
liquids
on
the
components
if
you
do
not
plan
to
cook
with
it
there
are
a
number
of
small
cooling
fans
designed
to
mount
on
the
chip
and
plug
into
your
power
supply
look
in
consumer
shoppers
now
if
only
some
innovative
person
could
design
and
produce
a
heat
sink
which
could
be
used
to
keep
my
coffee
warm
why
i
might
even
buy
a
pentium
