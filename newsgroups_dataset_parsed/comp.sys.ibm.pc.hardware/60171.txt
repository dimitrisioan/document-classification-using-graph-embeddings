michael

some
motherboards
support
vl
bus
and
cpu
there
is
an
option
bios
i
think
where
additional
waits
can
be
added
with
regard
to
cpuvl
bus
transactions
this
slows
the
cpu
down
to
a
rate
that
gives
the
vl
bus
devices
time
to
do
their
thing
these
particular
waits
are
applied
when
the
cpu
transacts
with
vl
bus
devices
you
want
to
enable
these
waits
only
if
you
are
using
a
with
vl
bus
devices
this
is
from
reading
my
motherboard
manual
and
these
are
my
interpre
tations
your
mileage
may
vary
strictly
speaking
vl

are
not
compatable
and
there
is
at
least
one
fudge
mechanism
to
physically
allow
it
to
