SAW
THE
FOLLOWING
COMPUTER
IN
A
STORE
AND
WANTED
TO
KNOW
IF
THIS
IS
A
GOOD
COMPUTER
OR
DOES
SOMEONE
SEE
SOMETHING
WRONG
WITH
IT
I
ALSO
WOULD

A
GOOD
PRICE
THANKS
I
RECENTLY
BOUGHT
A
LEADING
EDGE
MINI
TOWER
CASE
AND
EVERYTHING
WORKS
FINE
LEADING
EDGE
SEEMS
TO
BE
A
DECENT
BRAND
AND
WHATNOT
I
WOULD
TEND
TO
SAY
THAT
IT
IS
A
DECENT
DEAL
THE
ONLY
THINGS
YOU
MIGHT
WANT
TO
BE
WARY
ABOUT
IS
THAT
MY
LE
COMPUTER
HAS
A
BACKPLANE
MOUNTED
MOTHERBOARD
IE
THE
MOTHERBOARD
ITSELF
IS
A
CARD
THAT
CAN
BE
PLUGGED
IN
TO
A
BACKPLANE
SOME
PEOPLE
DONT
LIKE
THESE
CONFIGURATIONS
THE
SECOND
THING
IS
THAT
WHOEVER
SET
UP
MY
COMPUTER
AT
THE
FACTORY
DIDNT
REALLY
KNOW

THEY
WERE
DOING
THE

LOOK
