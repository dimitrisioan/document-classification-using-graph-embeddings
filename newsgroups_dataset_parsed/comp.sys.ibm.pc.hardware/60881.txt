CPU
NPJUST
GOT
A
SYSTEM
AND
AM
CONSIDERING
GETTING
A
FAN
FOR
THE
NPCPU
THE
PROCESSOR
WHEN
RUNNING
IS
TOO
HOT
TO
TOUCH
SO
I
THINK
THIS
IS
A
NPFAIRLY
GOOD
IDEA
LONG
AGO
WHEN
I
DID
SOME
ELECTRONICS
TRAINING
I
READ
NPSOMEWHERE
THAT
THE
REGIONS
WITHIN
A
CHIP
THAT
DEFINE
JUNCTIONSGATES
ETC
NPSLOWLY
DIFFUSE
OVER
TIME
AND
THIS
INCREASES
WITH
TEMPERATURE
HENCE
A
HOT
NPCHIP
GOES
OFFSPEC
SOONER
NPHAS
ANYONE
OUT
THERE
GOT
A

FAN
I
WORK
FOR
A

WE
OFFER
BOTH
A

OUR

MACHINES
ALWAYS
HAVE
A

COOLING
FAN
ON
AND
UNITS
NPIS
THERE
MORE
THAN
TYPE
THERE
ARE
SEVERAL
MANUFACTURERS
NPDO
YOU
HAVE
TO
REMOVE
THE
CPU
FROM
ITS
SCOKET
TO
INSTALL
THE
FAN
SOMETIMES
DEPENDS
ON
THE
SPECIFIC
FAN
MODEL
NPDO
ALL
CPU
FANS
DERIVE
THEIR
POWER
FROM
SPARE
DRIVE
POWER
LINES
ALL
THE

SO
YOU
DONT

ANYONE
HAVE
ANY

THAT

ARE
A
