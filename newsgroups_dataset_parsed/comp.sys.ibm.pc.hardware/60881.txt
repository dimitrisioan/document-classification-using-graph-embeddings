cpu
npjust
got
a
system
and
am
considering
getting
a
fan
for
the
npcpu
the
processor
when
running
is
too
hot
to
touch
so
i
think
this
is
a
npfairly
good
idea
long
ago
when
i
did
some
electronics
training
i
read
npsomewhere
that
the
regions
within
a
chip
that
define
junctionsgates
etc
npslowly
diffuse
over
time
and
this
increases
with
temperature
hence
a
hot
npchip
goes
offspec
sooner
nphas
anyone
out
there
got
a
cpu
fan
i
work
for
a
small
pc
oem
we
offer
both
a
personal
and
professional
system
line
our
pro
machines
always
have
a
cpu
cooling
fan
on
and
units
npis
there
more
than
type
there
are
several
manufacturers
npdo
you
have
to
remove
the
cpu
from
its
scoket
to
install
the
fan
sometimes
depends
on
the
specific
fan
model
npdo
all
cpu
fans
derive
their
power
from
spare
drive
power
lines
all
the
ones
ive
seen
do
many
come
with
a
y
connector
so
you
dont
have
to
have
a
spare
connector
npanyone
had
any
trouble
with
cpu
fans
none
npdoes
anyone
have
any
evidence
that
cpu
fans
are
a
complete
waste
of
money
touch
a
chip
after
its
been
running
a
few
minutes
you
wont
feel
the
fan
is
a
waste
nphow
are
these
fans
attached
glue
clips
melted
cheese
depends
on
the
model
many
use
clips
make
sure
you
use
heat
sink
grease
or
heat
transfering
tape
or
you
will
have
wasted
your
money
nproughly
how
much
cooler
will
the
cpu
be
with
a
fan
as
opposed
to
without
an
advert
ive
read
claims
vs
tough
to
tell
i
do
know
the
chip
sheds
a
lot
of
heat

murphy
was
an
