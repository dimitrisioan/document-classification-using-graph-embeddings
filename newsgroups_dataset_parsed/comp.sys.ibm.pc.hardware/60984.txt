re
motherboard
advice
needed
maybe
i
should
have
been
clearer
i
have
a
intel
that
i
would
like
to
use
to
put
together
a
system
however
all
the
motherboards
that
the
local
vendors
are
now
selling
are
running
either
at
or
mhz
i
guess
i
can
cross
my
fingers
and
hope
the
cpu
runs
at
that
speed
i
think
ill
take
marks
advice
and
see
if
any
of
the
boards
have
a
socketed
oscillator
and
head
down
to
the
local
electronics
store
thanks
for
the
info
