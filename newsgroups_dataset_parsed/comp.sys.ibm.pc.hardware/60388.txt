i
came
upon
this
idea
i
would
like
to
share
with
everyone
to
check
for
bad
memory
chips
create
a
boot
disk
with
himemsys
and
ramdrivesys
in
the
configautoexecbat
boot
the
pc
to
create
a
ram
drive
as
large
as
possible
use
a
disk
repair
utility
i
use
ndd
run
it
on
the
ram
drive
yes
it
will
run
its
only
a
device
driver
run
or
so
passes
they
go
very
quick
if
your
machine
fails
there
is
a
definate
bad
memory
chip
if
your
machine
passes
there
is
a
conflict
with
programs
you
are
loading
in
memory
its
an
interesting
idea
but
the
worstcase
data
patterns
developed
to
test
magnetic
media
are
totally
different
than
the
patterns
used
to
detect
common
faults
in
memory
chips
