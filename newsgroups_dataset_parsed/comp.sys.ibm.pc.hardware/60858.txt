WRITES
IDE
ALSO
USES
DMA
TECHNIQUES
I
BELIEVE
FLOPPY
CONTROLLER
ALSO
USES
DMA
AND
MOST
AD
BOARDS
ALSO
USE
DMA
DMA
IS
NO
BIG
DEAL
AND
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
DIRECTLY
WITH
SCSI
NO
THE
SIMPLE
STYLE
IDE
CONTROLLER
DOES
NOT
USE
DMA
THE
CPU
PERFORMS
THE
DATA
TRANSFER
WITH
A
STRING
MOVE
INSTRUCTION
THIS
REQUIRES
THAT
THE
CPU
STOP
WHAT
IT
HAD
BEEN
DOING
AND
TRANSFER
THE
DATA
ONLY
THE
SMART
DRIVE
CONTROLLERS
BE
THEY
IDE
OR
SCSI
CAN
TRANSFER
VIA
DMA
THESE
CONTROLLERS
TEND
TO
COST
THE
SAME
WETHER
THEY
ARE
IDE
OR
SCSI
TO
GET
THE
DMA
BENEFITS
IDE
MUST
SACRIFICE
ITS
PRICE
ADVANTAGE
ON
THE
CONTROLLER
FOR
EXAMPLE
WHEN
REWINDING
OR
FORMATTING
A
TAPE
THE
COMMAND
IS
ISSUED
TO
THE
CONTROLLER
AND
THE
BUS
IS
RELEASED
TO
ALLOW
ACCESS
TO
OTHER
DEVICES
ON
THE
BUS
THIS
GREATLY
INCREASES
PRODUCTIVITY
OR
AT
LEAST
DO
SOMETHING
ELSE
WHILE
BACKING
UP
YOUR
HARD
DRIVE
WHICH
HAPPENS
TO
BE
WHAT
I
AM
DOING
WHILE
READING
THIS
GROUP
YOU
CAN
THANK
YOUR
SOFTWARE
FOR
THAT
IF
DOS
HAD
A
FEW
MORE
BRAINS
IT
COULD
FORMAT
FLOPPIES
ETC
WHILE
YOU
WERE
DOING
SOMETHING
ELSE
THE
HARDWARE
WILL
SUPPORT
IT
BUT
DOS
AT
LEAST
WONT
AGAIN
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
SCSI
FLOPPIES
ARENT
ON
THE
IDE
BUS
YOUR
ARGUEMENT
MAKES
NO
SENSE
THIS
ISNT
AN
IDE
ISSUE
THE
FLOPPYS
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
PROCESSOR
ON
THEIR
CONTROLLER
BOARD
WHICH
HANDLES
ALL
OF
THESE
COMMANDS
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
IDE
AND
SCSI
IS
THAT
ALL
SCSI
PERIPHERIALS
ARE
INTELLIGENT
THEY
EACH
HAVE
THEIR
OWN
CONTROLLER
THEY
DEPEND
ON
THE
CPU
TO
DO
FEWER
THINGS
FOR
THEM
IE
IDE
DRIVES
NEEDING
A
PROCESSOR
TO
TRANSFER
THEIR
DATA
ITS
A
LONG
STORY
BUT
I
STILL
USE
IDE
ON
MY
EXCEPT
FOR
THE
CDROM
WHICH
THANKS
TO
SCSI
I
CAN
MOVE
BETWEEN
BOTH
MACHINES
IF
AND
WHEN
SCSI
IS
BETTER
STANDARDIZED
AND
SUPPORTED
ON
THE
IBMCLONE
MACHINES
I
PLAN
TO
COMPLETELY
GET
RID
OF
IDE
AND
IF
YOU
STICK
WITH
DOS
YOULL
WONDER
WHY
YOU
CANT
MULTITASK
AGAIN
I
ASK
WHY
CANT
A
UNIX
OR
TYPE
OS
DO
ALL
THE
MIRACULOUS
THINGS
WITH
AN
IDE
HARDDRIVE
THAT
IT
CAN
WITH
A
SINGLE
SCSI
HARD
DRIVE
THE
DETTACHCALLBACK
MECHANISM
ALOWS
THE
CPU
TO
MAKE
REQUESTS
OF
THE
DEVICES
ON
THE
SCSI
BUS
AND
THEN
DETTACH
AND
GO
ABOUT
ITS
BUSINESS
LATER
WHEN
THE
DEVICE
IS
DONE
IT
ISSUES
A
CALLBACK
TO
SAY
THAT
THE
DATA
HAS
ARRIVED
OR
THE
FUNCTION
HAS
COMPLETED
MOST
SCSI
CARDS
WILL
ALSO
DMA
THE
DATA
INTO
MEMORY
WITHOUT
THE
INTERUPTING
THE
CPU
THEREFORE
ALLOWING
IT
TO
CONTINUE
WORKING
UNINTERUPTED
IDE
SUPPORTS
NO
SUCH
CONCEPT
AS
DETTACHCALLBACK
CAN
YOU
SEE
HOW
THIS
WOULD
BE
A
WIN
IN
ANY
MULTITASKING
SYSTEM
