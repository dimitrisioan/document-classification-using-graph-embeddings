i
have
a
question
concerning
scsi
on
dos
i
have
a
scsi
controller
and
two
harddisks
conected
ids
and
id
like
to
connect
a
scsi
streamer
but
i
dont
have
software
to
access
it
does
such
a
beast

as
shareware
or
pd
also
what
if
i
want
a
third
disk
i
know
that
dos
only
can
see

physical

it
be
possible
to
use
extra
disks

what
others

actually

a
scsi
drive

i
could
do
with
the
drive
was

have
had
that
drivecontroller
coexist
with
mfm
rll
and
ide
drives
because
the
bios
will
kinda
muscle
itself
in
there
with
no
help
needed
from
the
computers
bios
dos
will
see
many
logical
drives
much
more
than
ive
had
up
to
ive
often
wondered
how
many
scsi
drives
you
could
hang
off
a
