in
going
with
the
modern
trend
the
orchid
card
only
supports
colors
in
mode
without
a
driver
of
course
this
breaks
any
dos
program
which
uses
svga
modes
like
most
of
my
cdroms
this
is
not
the
case
the
rom
on
the
supports
vesa
modes
of
up
to
in
colors
vesacompliant
applications
should
have
no
trouble
setting
these
modes
but
im
forwarding
your
posting
to
our
software
group
just
in
case
cant
be
too
careful
not
that
i
doubt
that
your
applications
are
failing
to
run
lots
of
stuff
depends
on
figuring
out
which
exact
svga
theyre
looking
at
and
dont
use
vesa
calls
vesa
is
still
pretty
new
every
new
chip
set
confuses
them
the
supported
resolutions
really
annoy
me
you
can
do
at
if
you
tell
the
driver
you
have
an
nec
they
only
have
about
six
monitors
listed
plus
generic
and
if
you
choose
generic
you
cant
get
any
high
refreshes
at
all
but
at
you
are
limited
to
seems
to
me
that
the
hardware
should
be
able
to
support
the
bandwidth
if
it
can
do
at
it
sure
should
be
able
to
do
it
at
higher
vertical
resolution
was
the
main
reason
i
bought
the
card
over
the
orchid
f
vlb
i
currently
have
and
it
will
do
hz
as
well
i
think
we
go
to
at
least
hz
at
and
maybe
more
and
its
a
function
of
the
ramdac
speed
not
the
power
we
need
to
fix
the
problems
youve
noted
they
were
already
on
the
list
if
youre
really
interested
though
take
a
look
at
the
text
file
which
holds
the
data
from
which
the
choices
in
the
monitor
installation
program
are
built
working
by
analogy
you
can
build
up
a
new
monitor
definition
that
has
the
right
combinations
of
refresh
rates
for
your
monitors
keep
a
backup
copy
of
the
file
once
youve
built
a
new
version
of
the
file
run
the
installation
program
inst
and
your
new
choices
should
show
up
this
assumes
you
have
the
weitek
v
drivers
you
can
tell
the
rev
number
by
looking
at
the
modification
time
of
the
driver
is
version
microsoft
uses
this
gimmick
too
the
board
is
faster
that
the
ofvlb
for
most
things
according
to
the
hercules
speedy
program
this
program
tests
various
operations
and
reports
the
results
in
pixelssecond
i
dont
have
the
numbers
for
the
graphite
card
but
they
were
close
to
half
of
the
ofvlb
ie
slower
but
that
was
running
in
a
isa
so
the
numbers
arent
really
comparable
the
following
numbers
were
all
obtained
using
a
mhz
air
motherboard
umc
chipset
with
mb
memory
i
give
ranges
because
the
program
reports
the
numbers
as
it
computes
them
and
these
tend
to
jump
around
a
bit
the
speedy
benchmark
was
put
out
by
hercules
and
iit
who
to
my
knowledge
were
unencumbered
by
any
motivations
except
making
the
hercules
graphiteiit
card
look
really
good
so
id
take
the
numbers
with
a
ton
of
salt
texas
instruments
did
the
same
thing
with
wintach
trying
to
make
the
look
good
compared
to
the
as
if
anyone
cared
its
safer
though
not
safe
to
use
benchmarks
from
unbiased
sources
such
as
testing
labs
columnists
etc
interestingly
the
solid
vectors
and
shaded
polygons
show
no
improvement
and
hatched
polygons
ie
filled
with
crosshatching
and
ternary
rops
whatever
they
are
graphics
operations
like
xors
maybe
are
a
dead
loss
on
the
i
think
youll
a
large
discrepancy
between
the
results
of
speedy
and
the
results
of
anything
else
in
the
universe
on
these
things
i
give
two
numbers
for
the
fonts
because
i
think
they
are
caching
when
the
fonts
are
first
drawn
on
the
screen
they
are
done
fairly
slowly
the
speed
of
the
ofvlb
then
the
speed
increases
dramatically
sounds
like
programming
to
a
benchmark
to
me
font
caching
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
optimization
windows
has
hooks
for
it
built
right
into
the
gdi
whats
kind
of
silly
is
iits
use
of
a
hardwired
the
quick
brown
fox
jumped
over
the
lazy
dog
then
sat
on
a
tack
string
in
their
driver
not
only
is
it
useless
in
real
applications
it
lacks
the
programming
elegance
of
the
bart
simpson
optimization
in
which
you
save
the
bitmap
of
the
mostrecently
drawn
string
in
offscreen
memory
and
just
do
a
screentoscreen
bitblit
if
you
happen
to
be
given
that
same
string
a
second
time
in
a
row
we
call
it
the
bart
simpson
optimization
because
barts
the
only
person
we
can
see
benefiting
from
it
he
could
right
i
will
not
cheat
on
benchmarks
a
hundred
times
and
be
done
in
half
the
time
it
would
take
to
actually
form
each
character
i
make
no
claims
that
these
numbers
mean
anything
at
all
its
just
what
i
saw
when
i
ran
them
on
my
computer
i
normally
dont
write
disclaimers
but
this
time
maybe
id
better
my
testing
is
totally
unconnected
with
my
work
i
program
under
unix
on
decstations
is
done
completely
without
the
knowledge
blessing
or
equipment
of
my
company
we
dont
have
any
lawyers
theyre
all
working
for
intel
there
used
to
be
a
lawyer
in
montana
who
didnt
but
he
died
