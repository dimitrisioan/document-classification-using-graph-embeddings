WRITES
I
SAW
A
POSTING
EARLIER
THAT
REFERED
TO
FUNETFI
DIRECTORY
PUBMSDOS
HOWEVER
WHEN
I
LOG
ON
TO
FUNETFI
I
CANT
EVEN
FIND
THE
PUB
DIRECTORY
LET
ALONE
THE
MSDOS
DIRECTORY
CAN
SOMEONE
TELL
ME
WHAT
IM
DOING
WRONG
PERHAPS
YOU
SHOULD
TRY
NICFUNETFI
INSTEAD
OF
FUNETFI
NICFUNETFI
IS
THE
BIGGEST
FTP
SITE
FROM
EUROPE
BUT
THE
STUFF
AVAILABLE
THERE
SHOULD
ALSO
BE
AVAILABLE
AT
THE
OTHER
SITE
OF
THE
BIG
POOL
PERRY
EGELMEERS
