sram
by
my
way
of
thinking
michael
how
could
this
memory
be
static
ram
if
it
has
a
speed
rating
i
didnt
think
sram
needed
a
refresh
time
doesnt
that
make
it
fast
dram
this
chip
would
take
to
return
valid
data
after
being
issued
an
address
refresh
time
none
for
sram
as
you
pointed
out
is
a
different
parameter
and
is
not
generally
referred
to
except
by
motherboard
designers
