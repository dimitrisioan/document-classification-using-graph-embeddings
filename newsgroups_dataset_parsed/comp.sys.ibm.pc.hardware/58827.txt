TO
THE
PROBLEM
HERE
WINDOWS

ON
DISKS
I
HATE
USING
DISKS
SO
I
COPIED
THEM
OVER

HIGH
DENSITY
USING
XCOPY
IT
WORKED
FINE
IN
FACT
FOR
A
WHILE
I
WAS
CHANGING
CONFIGURATIONS
AND
WHATNOT
SO
MUCH
THAT
I
DECIDED
TO
TRY
PUTTING
THEM
ON
THE
HARD
DISK
NOT
ONLY
CAN
YOU
COPY
THEM
OVER
WITH
ONE
DISK
PER
DIRECTORY
BUT
IF
YOU
WANT
TO
YOU
CAN
SIMPLY
COPY
THEM
ALL
INTO
ONE
DIRECTORY
MAKES
IT
A
LOT
NICER
WHEN
YOURE
SWITCHING
