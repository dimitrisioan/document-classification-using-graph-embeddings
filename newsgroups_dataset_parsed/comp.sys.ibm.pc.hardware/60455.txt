SOMEONE
IN
THIS
GROUP
POSTED
A
LITTLE
WHILE
BACK
THAT
THEY
WERE
GETTING
AN
ORCHID
CARD
HAS
THAT
CARD
ARRIVED
WHAT
DO
THE
BENCHMARKS
LOOK
LIKE
THE
ONE
I
GOT
ONLY
DOES
ABOUT
IN
TEXT
AND
VGAMCGA
MODE
WHICH
IS
ALMOST
IDENTICAL
TO
THE
OTHER
BASED
CARDS
ATI
DOES
ABOUT
THIS
IS
WEIRD
SINCE
THE
ORCHID
SUPPOSEDLY
SHOULD
BE
MUCH
FASTER
AND
I
WAS
TOLD
BY
SOMEONE
THAT
IT
CAN
DO
ALMOST
KBS
SINCE
THE
VGA
CHIP
IS
COVERED
BY
THE
ORCHID
LABEL
I
CANT
REALLY
TELL
FOR
SURE
IF
IT
USES
A
CHIP
BUT
THE
SPEC
SHEET
THAT
COMES
WITH
THE
BOARD
NO
DOCS
DID
SAY
IT
HAS
MEG
DRAM
AND
USES
A
CHIP
WINMARKS
IS
ABOUT
MIL
SLOWER
THAN
A
VIPER
VS
USING
STANDARD
PALETTE
BTW
IF
ANYONE
IS
INSTERESTED
IM
TRYING
TO
SELL
A

FOR
A
FRIEND
FOR
EMAIL
IF
INTERESTED
IM
TOO
BROKE
TO
TAKE
IT
MYSELF
ALSO
IS
THE
AMI
CARD
REAL
WHAT
DOES
IT
USE
FOR
VGA
SPEED
I
THINK
ITS
AVAILABLE
IN
LIMITED
QUANTITES
NO
IDEA
OF
WHAT
VGA
CHIP
IT
USES
THOUGH
BE
VERY
CAREFUL
WITH
OEM
BOARDS
THOUGH
THE
ORCHID
I
GOT
FOR
EXAMPLE
ONLY
HAS
A
README
FILE
ON
DISK
THAT
SERVE
AS
DOCUMENTATION
AND
CONFLICTS
THE
HELL
WITH
MY
VLB

OR
MAYBE
ITS
