my
home
viewsonic
i
like
the
multisyncs
because
its
easy
to
run
them
in
modes
like
colors
noninterlaced
or
at
higher
modes
like
oh
yeah
i
just
got
my
new
eizo
flexscan
yesterday
to
replace
my
old
and
i
tried
it
with
this
mode
is
just
great
i
can
get
four
perfectly
readable
command
windows
on
the
screen
and
if
i
need
more
colors
i
can
go
back
to
or
even
one
thing
i
am
wondering
though
why
isnt
there
a
monxxxxdgs
file
which
contains
all
the
resolutions
up
to
now
i
have
to
change
the
xgasetuppro
every
time
i
want
to
switch
instead
of
simply
going
through
the
system
settings
of
