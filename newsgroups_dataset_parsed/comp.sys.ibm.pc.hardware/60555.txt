BLOODY
THING

IVE
MANAGED
TO
GET
ONE
OR

OTHER
DRIVE

WITH
THE
OTHER
DISCONNECTED
BUT
NOT

AT
THE

TIME
WHENEVER

HANGS
DURING
BOOTUP
NEVER
GETS
PAST
THE
SYSTEM
TEST
THE
IDE
CONTROLLERS
INSTRUCTION
SHEET
SAYS
IT
SUPPORTS
TWO
DRIVES
I
THINK
IVE
CONFIGURED
THE
CMOS
CORRECTLY
THE
POWERS
PLUGGED
IN
PROPERLY
I
EVEN
LEARNED
ABOUT
THE
MASTERSLAVE
RELATIONSHIP
THAT
TWO
HDS
ARE
SUPPOSED
TO
HAVE
DIDNT
KNOW
PCS
WERE
INTO
SM
AND
I
THINK
I
CONFIGURED
THE
JUMPERS
PROPERLY
THE
ONE
IS
THE
MASTER
THE
NEW
ONE
IS
THE
SLAVE
THE
ONLY
THING
I
CAN
THINK
OF
IS
MAYBE
IM
DOING
THE
CABLING
WRONG
IVE
TRIED
SEVERAL
COMBINATIONS
CONTROLLER
MASTER
SLAVE
CONTROLLER
SLAVE
MASTER
MASTER
CONTROLLER
SLAVE
NONE
OF
THEM
WORKED
UNFORTUNATELY
I
CANT
THINK
OF
ANY
OTHERS
ANOTHER
POSSIBILITY
IS
THAT
THE
ONE
IS
ALREADY
PARTITIONED
INTO
TWO
SEPERATE
DRIVES
C
AND
D
AND
THE
CMOS
ASKS
FOR
C
DRIVE
AND
D
DRIVE
SETUP
INFO
RATHER
THAN
DRIVE
AND
DRIVE
LIKE
MOST
OTHERS
IVE
SEEN
COULD
THIS
BE
CONFUSING
THINGS
SO
I
NEED
HELP
THE
DRIVE
CAME
BEREFT
OF
ANY
DOCS
EXCEPT
FOR
SOME
INFO
FOR
THE
CMOS
SETUP
THE
CONTROLLER
HAS
A
LITTLE
PIECE
OF
PAPER
ABOUT
THE
SIZE
OF
AN
INDEX
CARD
I
CANNIBALIZED
THE
CABLE
ITS
ONE
OF
THOSE
WITH
A
CONNECTOR
AT
EACH
END
AND
THE
ONE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
SO
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
A
SERIAL
CONNECTION
NOW
I
BE
LOST

ADVANCE

IS
PRACTICALLY
AN
