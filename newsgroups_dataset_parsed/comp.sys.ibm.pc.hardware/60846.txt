BOOTING
FR
ON
TIM
KING
HAD
THE
UNMITIGATED
GALL
TO
SAY
THIS
TK
ACCIDENTALLY
DISCOVERED
THAT
IF
A
HAVE
A
FLOPPY
FROM
ONE
PARTICULAR
TK
BOX
OF
DISKETTETS
IN
THE
A
DRIVE
WHEN
I
BOOT
UP
RATHER
THAN
GETTING
TK
THE
NONSYSTEM
DISKETTE
MESSAGE
THE
MACHINE
HANGS
AND
THE
CMOS
TK
GETS
OVERWRITTEN
LUCKILY
GATEWAY
SENDS
A
PRINT
OF
THE
STANDARD
JUST
A
WILD
THOUGHT
HERE
BUT
HOW
ABOUT
THIS
THERE
IS
A
SMALL
BOOT
PROGRAM
ON
EVERY
FORMATTED
DISKETTE
WHETHER
OR
NOT
IT
CONTAINS
SYSTEM
FILES
IT
IS
THIS
SMALL
PROGRAM
THAT
PRINTS
THE
NONSYSTEM
DISK
ERROR
NOT
DOS
IF
THIS
PROGRAM
TRIES
TO
TRANSFER
CONTROL
TO
A
BIOS
LOCATION
THAT
IS
NONSTANDARD
ON
THE
GATEWAY
THEN
IT
COULD
CLEAR
THE
BIOS
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
THE
BIOS
IS
OVERWRITTEN
THERE
IS
USUALLY
A
SMALL
ROUTINE
TO
CLEAR
THE
CMOS
AREA
IN
CASE
AN
INVALID
CONFIGURATION
PREVENTS
THE
MACHINE
FROM
BOOTING
I
THINK
THAT
THE
BOOT
CODE
ON
THE
FUJI
DISKS
MAY
INADVERTANTLY
CALL
THIS
ROUTINE
JUST
A
THOUGHT
DONT
HIT
