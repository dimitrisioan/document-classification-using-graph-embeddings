windows
virtual
memory
ive
got
a
and
im
using
windows
sometimes
i
wondered
why
windows
worked
endlessly
on
my
hd
when
i
was
doing
nothing
execpt
having
lunch
or
something
like
that
then
i
turned
this
virtual
memory
swapfile
off
and
windows
became
quite
faster
but
now
having
less
memory
free
and
so
im
still
wondering
why
windows
is
reading
everything
from
virtual
memory
when
the
convertional
is
sufficient
any
commonsenseexplanation
is
really
appreciated
