diamond
video
cards
stealth
viper
speedstar
etc
may
have
excellent
specifications
and
the
windows
drivers
that
come
with
them
might
make
windows
blindingly
fast
but
most
fellow
diamond
video
board
owners
with
whom
ive
corresponded
may
or
may
not
share
your
opinion
about
the
proprietary
clocking
scheme
but
all
of
those
with
whom
ive
chatted
have
not
been
thrilled
with
the
windows
drivers
either
some
modes
work
fine
but
others
cause
strange
misdrawn
objects
trails
etc
many
have
also
voiced
their
strong
discontent
to
diamonds
ambivalent
attitude
toward
drivers
come
to
think
of
it
though
i
hear
and
see
a
lot
of
complaints
about
the
ati
boards
too
though
recent
word
looks
like
the
build
code
looks
much
better
does
anyone
have
an
accelerated
video
board
with
drivers
for
windows
where
all
the
modes
function
properly
