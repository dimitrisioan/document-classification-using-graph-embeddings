anyone
tell
me
if
this

believe
so
since
the
buslogic

have
proven
to
be
very
reliable
in
where
do
i
get
drivers
endusers
not
oem
manufactures

get
all
the
software
package
with
the
card
which
includes
drivers
for
novell
unix
xenix
and
so
forth

this
card
work
with
the
toshiba
cdrom
in
dos

my
setup
quantam

better
than
