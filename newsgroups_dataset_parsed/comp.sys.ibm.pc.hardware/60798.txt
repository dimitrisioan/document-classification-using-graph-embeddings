WHAT
IS
A
UART
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
EXACT
MEANING
OF
UART
BUT
I
THINK
IT
IS
SOMETHING
LIKE
UNIVERSAL
ARITHMETIC
RECEIVER
TRANSMITTER
NORMALLY
THE
OLDER
BOARDS
HAVE
A
OR
UART
ON
BOARD
THOSE
CHIPS
GENERATE
AN
IRQ
FOR
EVERY
CHAR
THEY
RECEIVED
THE
UART
HAS
AN
INTERNAL
BYTE
BUFFER
SO
WITH
THE
RIGHT
SOFTWARE
INSTALLED
IT
GENERATES
AN
IRQ
EVERY
CHARS
WHAT
DOES
IT
DO
FOR
HIGHSPEED
MODEMS
IS
IT
NECESSARY
FOR
OR
HIGHER
THROUGHPUT
IF
YOU
RAN
DOS
YOU
DONT
NEED
A
BECAUSE
DOS
RUNS
ONLY
ONE
TASK
AT
A
TIME
AND
THE
WHOLE
CPUPOWER
COULD
BE
USED
FOR
THE
TRANSFER
BUT
IF
YOU
ARE
RUNNING
A
MULTITASKING
OS
SUCH
AS
UNIX
ETC
WINDOWS
THE
CPU
CANNOT
WORK
THE
WHOLE
TIME
WITH
ONE
TASK
THE
RESULT
ARE
LOST
CHARACTERS
OR
BROKEN
TRANSMISSIONS
BECAUSE
OF
TIMEOUTS
IS
IT
ONLY
FOR
INTERNAL
MODEMS
NO
THE
ONLY
DIFFRENCE
IS
THAT
INTERNAL
MODEMS
HAVE
THE
UART
ON
BOARD
WHEREAS
EXTERNAL
MODEMS
ARE
CONNECTED
TO
THE
COMPUTER
OVER
A
SERIAL
PORT
WHICH
HAS
THE
UART
ON
BOARD
IF
YOU
HAVE
ANY
EXPERIENCE
WITH
OR
HIGHER
SPEED
MODEMS
PLEASE
LET
ME
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
THINK
ALSO
ANY
PARTICULAR
BRAND
NAME
RECCOMENDED
OR
WILL
A
CHEAPO
CLONE
DO
JUST
A
WELL
I
USE
A
WITH
A
UNDER
COHERENT
IM
VERY
SATISFIED
WITH
IT
BUT
I
THINK
THAT
NEARLY
EVERYONE
IS
SATISFIED
WITH
HIS
OWN
MODEM
