re
vs
anonymous
i
saw
a
posting
about
the
choice
between
and
a
i
was
wondering
although
a
is
faster
because
of
the
path
to
its
external
cache
shouldnt
the
choice
be
the
as
that
one
can
be
made
to
work
properly
with
a
localbus
i
mean
cache
speed
is
one
thing
but
all
your
speed
will
be
blocked
during
video
io
so
just
get
that
faster
im
willing
to
speculate
that
the
with
localbus
will
be
times
as
fast
as
the
and
probably
as
expensive
or
cheap
