ranges
from

is
always
although
there
are
some
nonstandard
versions
the
above
does
not
tell
the
proper
story
of
scsi
scsii
asynchronous
ave
synchronous
max
transfer
base
this
requires
a
controller
chip
and
provides
to
speeds
with
controlers
with
with
burst
and
with
and
fast
scsi
can
be
wide
or
fast
it
depends
on
how
the
port
is
designedthe
quadras
will
support
fast
scsi
but
not
wide
when
the
os
scsi
manager
is
rewritten
since
the
quardas
use
a
nonwide
port
the
article
in
pc
mag
was
talking
about
uses
ten
devices
in
it
native
mode
outside
its
native
mode
it
behaves
a
lot
like
devices
slower
through
put
from
your
own
figures
is
indeed
twice
esdi
as
the
article
pointed
out
as
for
faster
then
ide
that
seems
to
be
using
a
contoler
chip
the
mac
quadra
uses
a
controler
chip
for
its
and
gets
through
put
for
asynchronous
far
in
excess
of
a
normal
synchronous
output
of
is
which
is
near
the
burst
of
a
machine
with
a
controller
chip
the
pc
world
seems
to
have
and
mixed
up
fact
is
controler
chips
allow
near
speeds
through
a
device
as
shown
in
the
mac
quadra
which
skews
some
of
the
data
of
vs
ide
or
esdi
test
i
agree
that
the
article
could
have
stated
that
the
faster
then
ide
came
off
a
device
with
a
chip
maybe
it
was
there
and
the
editor
killed
it
because
the
article
was
dealing
with
not
and
he
did
not
understand
the
effect
of
a
device
with
a
controller
chip
chips
are
limited
to
max
devices
with
chips
becoming
common
produce
up
to
in
mode
and
in
mode
the
fast
version
ports
cannot
use
wide
scsi
of
cource
the
prime
piece
of
wierdness
is
that
devices
have
chips
or
more
accurately
the
machine
does
this
allows
the
best
of
both
worlds
high
speeds
and
cheeper
costs
full
hardware
port
electronic
controller
etc
is
very
expensive
it
also
creates
a
logistic
nightmare
as
to
how
fast
goes
when
one
knows
the
facts
behind
the
numbers
then
one
realizes
that
the
article
knows
what
it
is
talking
about
even
if
it
does
not
tell
how
the
figures
came
about
while
is
throwing
out
ranges
that
dont
tell
squat
since
he
ignores
devices
with
chips
his
ranges
tell
even
less
then
intended
