SOUNDBLASTER
IRQ
AND

INTERESTING
WOULD
YOU
CARE
TO
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
THEN
HOW
MY
SOUNDBLASTER
PRO
CARD
AND
MY
PRINTER
CARD
ARE
SHARING
IRQ
SUCCESSFULLY
I
ASSURE
YOU
THAT
THEY
ARE
BOTH
SET
TO
IRQ
AND
THAT
I
HAVE
NO
PROBLEM
MY
COMPUTER
IS
A
DTK
IBM
CLONE
RUNNING
MSDOS
OR
A
DERIVATIVE
OS
OBVIOUSLY
PLEASE
TAKE
NOTE
THAT
THE
FOLLOWING
IS
NOT
WHAT
EXACTLY
HAPPENS
BUT
A
SLIGHTLY
SIMPLIFIED
EXPLANATION
TECHNICALLY
THE
IRQ
LINE
IS
ONLY
A
MEANS
FOR
THE
DEVICE
PRINTER
ADAPTER
SOUNDBLASTER
MODEM
HARD
DISK
TO
SIGNAL
THE
CPU
THAT
SOMETHINGS
HAPPENING
HERE
PLEASE
TAKE
NOTE
HOW
THE
CPU
IS
PROGRAMMED
TO
HANDLE
THIS
SIGNAL
IS
USUALLY
UP
TO
THE
OPERATING
SYSTEM
IN
MSDOS
THE
INTERRUPT
VECTOR
IS
USED
TO
STORE
THE
ADDRESS
OF
THE
FUNCTION
THAT
HANDLES
EACH
INTERRUPT
NOW
BASIC
DOS
DOESNT
CARE
WHETHER
THE
PRINTER
REPORTS
THAT
ITS
READY
TO
PRINT
SOME
MORE
STUFF
OR
NOT
IT
SIMPLY
IGNORES
THE
INTERRUPT
WHEN
DOS
PRINTS
IT
LOOKS
AT
THE
LPT
BUFFER
IF
THERES
A
CHARACTER
THERE
WAIT
A
WHILE
AND
CHECK
AGAIN
IF
THERES
NOT
COPY
A
NEW
CHARACTER
TO
THE
LPT
PORT
SINCE
THE
IRQ
IS
IGNORED
AS
A
PRINTER
INTERRUPT
ITS
FREE
FOR
USE
FOR
ANY
OTHER
ADAPTERS
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
SB
WITH
ANY
MULTITASKING
OR
OTHERWISE
ADVANCED
OS
THIS
KIND
OF
PRINTING
APPROACH
JUST
DOESNT
WORK
OR
MORE
PRECISELY
IT
WASTES
A
LOT
OF
CPU
CYCLES
HENCE
YOU
CANT
SHARE
THE
IRQ
WITH
AND
SB
IF
YOURE
RUNNING
UNIX
OR
OR
WHATNOT
ANOTHER
ISSUE
WITH
THE
SB
IS
THAT
ONLY
THE
DIGITIZED
SOUND
USES
INTERRUPTS
WHEN
THE
SB
PLAYS
PLAIN
MUSIC
THE
CPU
SIMPLY
TELLS
IT
WHAT
TO
PLAY
UNTIL
TOLD
OTHERWISE
WITH
DIGITIZED
SOUND
THE
INTERRUPT
IS
REQUIRED
TO
NOTIFY
THE
CPU
WHEN
THE
OUTPUT
ENDS
AND
NEW
DATA
IS
NEEDED
YOU
CAN
HOWEVER
HOOK
TWO
OR
MORE
COM
PORTS
TO
ONE
INTERRUPT
BUT
USE
THEM
ONLY
ONE
AT
A
TIME
THIS
IS
BECAUSE
THE
INTERRUPT
HANDLING
ROUTINE
IS
SAME
FOR
BOTH
PORTS
AND
IT
CAN
SEE
FROM
WHICH
PORT
THE
DATA
CAME
FROM
THIS
OF
COURSE
APPLIES
FOR
SOME
OTHER
DEVICES
LIKE
LPT
AS
WELL
REMEMBER
THIS
WAS
GREATLY
SIMPLIFIED
IN
PARTS
BUT
I
THINK
GIVES
THE
GENERAL
PICTURE
CORRECTLY
ENOUGH
