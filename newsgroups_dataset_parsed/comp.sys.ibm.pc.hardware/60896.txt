re
any
info
on
cyrix
chip
it
seems
that
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
regarding
the
cyrix
compatible
and
my
info
comes
directly
from
cyrixs
fast
fax
service
and
also
from
installing
one
of
these
chips
in
an
ibm
model
the
is
a
instruction
set
compatible
cpu
which
fits
into
a
socket
pin
grid
array
or
pga
the
dlc
currently
is
available
in
speeds
the
the
and
the
they
do
not
have
a
coprocessor
on
board
but
any
software
query
will
return
coproc
as
present
i
guess
they
emulate
the
coproc
instructions
math
functions
are
on
the
level
without
the
actual
coprocessor
the
internal
cache
on
the
is
cyrix
literature
claims
a
hit
rate
my
informal
tests
show
that
the
cache
accounts
for
a
performance
boost
when
it
is
enabled
by
software
overall
performance
boost
from
a
to
a
is
about
the
benchmarks
i
used
were
nu
si
and
qaplus
dhrystones
and
whetstones
the
performance
with
the
cache
enabled
is
about
on
a
par
with
my
with
external
cpu
cache
which
is
around
the
performance
for
a
the
computer
runs
noticebly
faster
and
dos
with
dblspace
is
not
complaining
the
company
claims
compatibility
but
i
didnt
test
it
the
is
not
a
chip
as
commonly
thought
the
is
actually
a
small
daughterboard
slightly
larger
than
the
which
contains
the
logic
to
manage
the
clock
doubler
this
board
plugs
into
the
pga
and
the
or
plugs
into
this
board
i
guess
the
board
doubles
the
frequency
apparent
to
the
cpu
and
insert
wait
states
when
access
to
the
rest
of
the
system
is
required
there
are
no
info
available
from
cyrix
there
anyway
the
is
available
for
and
only
double
these
clock
rates
and
you
get
the
and
the
dlcs
if
cyrix
is
planning
to
do
the
same
thing
for
the
then
they
need
to
put
out
the
first
i
also
tested
a
motherboard
along
with
a
cyrix
coprocessor
with
external
cache
performance
were
about
faster
than
the
but
still
significantly
slower
than
an
actual
intel
imho
the
dlc
is
a
great
low
price
upgrade
for
people
who
cant
afford
or
cant
install
a
new
motherboard
it
is
definitely
worth
what
i
paid
for
it
but
if
you
need
performance
the
wont
cut
it
im
not
sure
about
the
but
i
think
even
if
it
matches
the
performance
it
wont
beat
it
in
any
significant
way
the
last
time
i
posted
info
about
the
dlc
people
sent
quite
a
bit
of
mail
asking
where
i
got
it
so
here
is
where
i
got
mine
treasure
chest
peripherals
they
advertise
in
the
computer
shopper
the
kit
was
but
i
liked
the
chip
so
much
that
i
found
the
supplier
and
became
a
dealer
if
you
are
interested
in
the
chip
email
me
and
i
can
fax
or
mail
you
more
info
im
well
aware
of
the
nets
policy
against
commercial
use
so
i
cant
post
anymore
info
here
however
if
there
are
more
questions
regarding
the
itself
ill
post
what
i
can
jamesc
if
someone
asks
if
you
are
a
god
you
say
yes
