somebody
tell
me
which
settings
of
these
four
jumpers
correspond
to
what
io
addresses
the

ibm
for
a
while
is
the
only
ethernet
card
i
know
of
that
doesnt
use
io
addresses
it
only
has
interrupts
and
shared
memory
the
jumpers
you
see
control
bits
in
the
base
address
of
the
shared
memory
i
cant
recall
which
