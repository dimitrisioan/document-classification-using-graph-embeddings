RUSSESTAMPEXCOM
STEVE
RUSSELL
WRITES
DELETIONS
THE
ATTACHED
FANS
LOOK
SLICK
AND
WORK
WELL
BUT
IM
BOTHERED
BY
THE
POTENTIAL
LOSS
OF
COOLING
IF
THE
FAN
GOES
OUT
AT
LEAST
WITH
THE
POWER
SUPPLY
FAN
YOU
CAN
REACH
BACK
THERE
EVERY
FEW
DAYS
AND
FEEL
THE
FAN
BLOWING
YES
THIS
IS
A
VALID
CONCERN
IMHO
WITH
THE
DIRECTLY
ATTACHED
FAN
UNITS
IVE
SEEN
IT
LOOKS
LIKE
IF
THE
FAN
WERE
TO
STOP
THE
CHIP
COOLING
WOULD
BE
A
GOOD
BIT
WORSE
THAN
NO
HEAT
SINK
AT
ALL
IN
OTHER
WORDS
IF
THE
FAN
STOPS
THE
UNIT
TURNS
INTO
AN
INSULATOR
AND
THE
CHIP
MIGHT
GET
HOT
ENOUGH
TO
SUFFER
PERMANENT
DAMAGE
NOT
JUST
STOP
WORKING
TEMPORARILY
I
PREFER
TO
PUT
A
STOCK
FAN
OFF
THE
DRIVE
BRACKETS
OR
FRONT
PANEL
TO
BLOW
AIR
ACROSS
THE
CPU
DEPENDS
A
LOT
ON
CASE
AND
BOARD
LAYOUT
THOUGH
MY
ZEOS
TOWER
CASE
HAS
A
PASSIVE
HEAT
SINK
ON
THE
CPU
AND
ITS
LOCATED
SO
THE
FRONT
FAN
WHICH
SUCKS
AIR
INTO
THE
CASE
BLOWS
RIGHT
ON
THE
HEAT
SINK
IF
THAT
FAN
STOPS
THE
HEAT
SINK
IS
STILL
COOLED
BY
CONVECTION
AIR
FLOW
SO
SHOULD
NOT
SEE
TOO
DRAMATIC
A
TEMPERATURE
RISE
ESSENTIALLY
THE
ARRANGEMENT
YOURE
TALKING
ABOUT
AND
A
GOOD
IDEA
IMHO
ONCHIP
FANS
FROM
FRYS
ELECTRONICS
IN
THE
SF
BAY
AREA
ARE
ABOUT
I
GET
THE
STOCK
POWER
SUPPLY
