with
adaptec
scsi
and
jumbo
tape
drive
hi
ive
just
replaced
my
existing
dtc
scsi
controller
with
an
adaptec
and
am
now
having
trouble
restoring
from
a
jumbo
tape
drive
i
had
no
trouble
installing
the
adaptec
and
dos
recognises
both
the
scsi
drive
and
an
existing
ide
drive
however
when
i
went
to
restore
the
backups
from
the
jumbo
tape
i
found
that
it
was
extremely
slow
estimated
time
mins
actual
time
min
i
have
no
trouble
restoring
from
the
same
tape
to
the

i
seem
to
remember
reading
that
some
settings
had
to
be
changed
to
enable
the
jumbo
drive
and
the
adaptec
to
work
together
but
i
cant
find
any
mention
of
it
in
the
manuals

system
config
is
adaptec
running
fujitsu

running
off
floppy
