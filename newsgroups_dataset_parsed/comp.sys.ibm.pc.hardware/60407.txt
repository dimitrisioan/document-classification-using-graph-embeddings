CONTROLLER
WITH

BIOS
ENABLED
SEAGATE
SCSI
DRIVE
ALRIGHTY
WHEN
I
BOOT
UP
I
GET
THE
ADAPTEC
BIOS
MESSAGE
BUT
IT
SAYS
SOMETHING
LIKE
DRIVE
C
INSTALLED
DRIVE
D
INSTALLED
ADAPTEC
SCSI
BIOS
NOT
INSTALLED
AND
I
CANT
GET
TO
THE
SEAGATE
DRIVE
I
GO
INTO
PHOENIXBIOS
SETUP
REMOVE
THE
ENTRY
FOR
DRIVE
D
AND
BOOM
I
CAN
ACCESS
THE
SEAGATE
IS
THERE
A
WAY
TO
GET
TWO
IDE
DRIVES
AND
THE
SEAGATE
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
HAVE
BUT
IT
JUST
HANGS
THE
SYSTEM
BRIAN
THERE
IS
A
SIMPLE
ANSWER
IF
MY
MEMORY
SERVES
ME
THE
SCSI
BIOS
WILL
ONLY
WORK
AS
THE
FIRST
OR
SECOND
DRIVE
ANY
BUILTIN
DRIVES
EG
IDE
ARE
INSTALLED
FIRST
AND
THEN
WHEN
THE
SCSI
BIOS
RUNS
IT
WILL
TRY
TO
INSTALL
AS
THE
NEXT
DRIVE
BUT
IF
THERE
ARE
ALREADY
TWO
DRIVES
THEN
NO
CAN
DO
THE
SOLUTION
IS
SIMPLE
USE
THE
DEVICE
DRIVER
AND
DISABLE
THE
SCSI
BIOS
AS
IT
IS
USELESS
IN
YOUR
CASE
IT
WORKS
LIKE
A
CHAMP
I
HAVE
SEEN
A
SIMILAR
SITUATION
BEFORE
GOOD
LUCK
