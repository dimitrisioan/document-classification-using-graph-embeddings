computers
i
recently
purchased
the
then
current
pkg
for
but
changed
to
nec
monitor
upgrade
buy
this
pkg
now
for
more
you
now
get
a
bigger
hd
with
hd
cache
days
ago
when
i
bought
this
pkg
it
was
with
hd
cache
this
is
a
great
deal
although
it
is
generally
recommended
you
at
least
upgrade
to
the
zeos
ctx
monitor
for
more
i
believe
whether
you
also
upgrade
to
the
diamond
viper
video
card
is
your
choice
i
stayed
with
the
diamond
speedstar
pro
zeos
tech
support
is
really
good
call
after
normal
business
hours
to
get
the
fastest
access
the
hardest
part
about
buying
a
zeos
is
the
wait
till
it
is
delivered
once
you
order
you
can
hardly
wait
to
get
it
there
are
quite
a
few
good
mail
order
houses
around
lots
of
bang
for
buck
with
zeos
