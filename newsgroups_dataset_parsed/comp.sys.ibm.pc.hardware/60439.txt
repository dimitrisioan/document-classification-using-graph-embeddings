help
on
hand
scanners
wanted
fellow
netters
im
in
the
market
for
a
hand
scanner
however
i
dont
know
anyone
who
has
one
i
have
my
eye
on
two
choices
dexxa
this
scanner
is
available
at
walmart
for
it
includes
grayworks
software
and
provides
dpi
and
grayscales
i
think
the
ocr
software
catchword
is
available
through
mailorder
for
about
also
mustek
gray
artist
for
windows
this
scanner
offers
grayscales
according
to
cad
graphics
and
dpi
it
is
available
for
mailorder
and
comes
with
perceive
ocr
and
picture
publisher
le
i
am
also
looking
at
a
genius
hand
scanner
from
cad
graphics
it
is
basically
the
same
as
the
mustek
scanner
except
for
the
resolution
dpi
and
price
basically
i
would
like
recommendations
on
which
to
buy
i
have
heard
that
logitech
makes
the
best
and
manufactures
dexxa
scanners
but
which
one
is
the
best
buy
would
dpi
really
be
helpful
output
would
be
no
better
than
hp
laserjet
iii
or
canon
to
i
am
leaning
toward
the
mustek
because
it
offers
the
most
features
and
is
in
the
middle
in
terms
of
prices
which
should
i
buy
if
you
have
a
hand
scanner
please
let
me
know
whether
or
not
you
would
recommend
it
also
if
you
know
of
another
scanner
within
the
price
range
under
that
would
be
a
better
deal
please
email
me
any
and
all
help
would
be
greatly
appreciated
