WARNING
MIDWEST
MICRO
OHIO
I
RAN
OUT
OF
TIME
ON
MY
LAST
REPLY
TO
THIS
STRING
AND
I
DONT
KNOW
IF
IT
WAS
SENT
OR
NOT
BUT
I
HAVE
NEVER
HEARD
OF
ANYONE
THAT
HAD
TO
RETURN
SOMETHING
IN
THE
GRACE
PERIED
THAT
HAD
A
PROBLEM
AT
ALL
WITH
MIDWEST
MICRO
THEY
MAY
OF
THOUGHT
THAT
YOU
DIDNT
KNOW
WHAT
YOU
WERE
DOING
AND
SUGGESTED
HOW
TO
CORRECT
THE
PROBLEM
BUT
IT
SOUNDED
AS
YOU
DIDNT
GIVE
THEM
MUCH
OF
A
CHANCE
TO
CORRECT
THINGS
AT
ALL
THE
FACT
THAT
THE
PPI
WORKED
OKAY
FOR
YOU
IS
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SETUP
MORE
FOR
THE
NO
NOTHING
USER
THAT
CANT
UNDERSTAND
THE
INSTRUCTION
AND
THE
COMMANDS
TO
CONFIGURE
IT
TO
HISHER
SYSTEM
WHEN
YOU
FIND
OUT
THINGS
LIKE
THE
FACT
THE
THE
EC
LED
THAT
LOOKS
LIKE
YOU
HAVE
CONNECTED
TO
ANOTHER
EC
MODEM
DOESNT
REALY
SAY
THAT
BUT
THAT
IT
ONLY
TELLS
YOU
THAT
YOU
HAVE
EC
TURNED
ON
ON
YOUR
MODEM
I
THINK
THAT
THESE
LED
ARE
NOTHING
MORE
THAT
JUST
LIGHT
TO
HYPE
UP
THE
PRODUCT
JUST
LIKE
I
BET
SOMEONE
TOOK
HOME
A
FEW
EXTRA
IN
THE
LAST
YEAR
FOR
GIVING
THE
PPI
MODEMS
THE
PCMAGAZINE
AWARD
OF
THE
YEAR
NOT
SO
FOR
THE
STASH
OF
THEM
THAT
I
SAW
ON
MY
TEST
BENCH
I
COULD
GO
ON
FOR
HOURS
AT
NO
END
AS
TO
ALL
OF
THE
PROBLEMS
THAT
I
FOUND
WITH
THE
PPI
MODEMS
BUT
I
WILL
TRY
TO
CONTROL
MYSELF
I
WILL
NOT
EVEN
GO
INTO
THE
WEEKS
IT
TOOK
PPI
TO
CREDIT
MY
CARD
BACK
FOR
THE
MODEMS
AFTER
THEY
HAD
RECEIVED
THEM
BACKNO
I
WILL
NOT
GO
INTO
THAT
ONE
NOR
WILL
I
GO
INTO
TALKING
TO
THE
PARENT
CO
CO
FROM
HAYES
ILL
JUST
SAY
I
HOPE
YOU
LIKE
YOUR
NEW
MODEM
AND
MAYBE
SOMEONE
THAT
CAN
UNDERSTAND
HOW
TO
SETUP
A
MODEM
WILL
GET
THE
ONE
THAT
YOU
SENT
BACK
MAYBE
A
GOOD
FRIEND
OF
MINE

HOPE
GOSHI
