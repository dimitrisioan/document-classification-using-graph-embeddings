RAM
BOARDS
ON
A
HELLO
I
HAVE
A
ISA
MACHINE
WITH
PHEONIX
BIOS
CURRENTLY
I
HAVE
MEGABYTES
OF
RAM
INSTALLED
VIA
EIGHT
MG
SIMMS
ON
THE
MOTHERBOARD
IE
BOTH
BANKS
ARE
FULL
AND
THERE
IS
NO
SPACE
FOR
MORE
SIMMS
I
AM
THINKING
OF
RUNNING
ON
MY
MACHINE
AND
POSSIBLY
LINUX
WITH
X
WINDOWS
AND
I
KNOW
THAT
MORE
RAM
WOULD
BE
HELPFUL
HOWEVER
WITH
SIMMS
THE
ONLY
SOLUTION
I
CAN
SEE
IS
TO
SELL
MY
MEGS
FOR
ABOUT
AND
BY
SIMMS
FOR
ABOUT
USED
APART
FROM
THE
FACT
THAT
I
CANT
AFFORD
THE
PRICE
RIGHT
NOW
THE
ENTIRE
PROCESS
OF
SELLING
RAM
AND
BUYING
IT
USED
PROBABLY
MEANS
THAT
THE
MACHINE
MIGHT
BE
DOWN
FOR
A
NUMBER
OF
DAYS
WHICH
I
WOULD
RATHER
AVOID
SO
MY
QUESTION
IS
DO
THE
AT
RAM
BOARDS
THAT
PLUG
INTO
A
FREE
SLOT
WORK
WELL
WITH
A
ISA
MACHINE
I
HAVE
SEEN
SOME
BEING
SOLD
USED
FOR
ABOUT
WITH
MG
WITH
SPACE
FOR
ANOTHER
IF
THESE
BOARDS
DO
WORK
HOW
DO
THEY
DO
IT
IS
A
DEVICE
DRIVER
NEEDED
OR
WILL
THE
BIOS
PICKUP
THE
EXTRA
RAM
AS
IT
DOES
WITH
THE
SIMMS
ON
THE
MOTHER
BOARD
I
KNOW
THAT
THE
ISA
EXPANSIONS
SLOTS
ARE
AND
SIMM
MEMORY
IS
BITS
SO
PROBABLY
ALL
OF
THIS
IS
JUST
WISHFUL
THINKING
HOWEVER
ANY
HELP
IS
TRULY
APPRECIATED
