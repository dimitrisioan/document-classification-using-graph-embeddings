BRIAN
KENDIG
WRITES
IVE
ASKED
YOUR
GOD
SEVERAL
TIMES
WITH
ALL
MY
HEART
TO
COME
TO
ME
I
REALLY
WISH
I
COULD
BELIEVE
IN
HIM
COS
NO
MATTER
HOW
MUCH
CONFIDENCE
I
BUILD
UP
ON
MY
OWN
THE
UNIVERSE
IS
A
BIG
PLACE
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
SO
NICE
TO
KNOW
I
HAVE
SOMEONE
WATCHING
OVER
ME
IN
IT
BRIAN
K
I
AM
PLEASED
WITH
YOUR
HONESTY
AND
TO
BE
HONEST
AS
WELL
I
BELIEVE
YOU
HAVE
NOT
ASKED
MY
GOD
TO
COME
TO
YOU
WHY
DO
I
SAY
THIS
BECAUSE
BY
THE
THINGS
YOU
WRITE
ON
THE
NET
AND
THE
MANNER
WITH
WHICH
YOU
WRITE
THEM
YOU
SHOW
ME
THAT
YOU
MADE
UP
YOUR
OWN
GOD
AND
ARE
ATTEMPTING
TO
PASS
HIM
OFF
AS
THE
REAL
THING
I
GOT
NEWS
FOR
YOU
YOURS
DOESNT
AT
ALL
SOUND
LIKE
MINE
YOUR
GOD
DOESNT
COME
TO
YOU
BECAUSE
YOUR
GOD
DOESNT
EXIST
IVE
GONE
INTO
THIS
WITH
AN
OPEN
MIND
IVE
LAYED
MY
BELIEFS
ASIDE
FROM
TIME
TO
TIME
WHEN
IVE
HAD
DOUBT
AND
IVE
PRAYED
TO
SEE
WHAT
GOOD
THAT
WOULD
DO
I
DONT
SEE
WHAT
MORE
I
CAN
DO
TO
OPEN
MYSELF
TO
YOUR
GOD
SHORT
OF
JUST
DECIDING
TO
BELIEVE
FOR
NO
GOOD
REASON
AND
IF
I
DECIDE
TO
BELIEVE
FOR
NO
GOOD
REASON
WHY
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
SOME
OTHER
GOD
ZEUS
SEEMS
LIKE
A
PRETTY
COOL
CANDIDATE
I
AM
SORRY
BRIAN
BUT
WHEN
I
READ
YOUR
POSTINGS
I
DO
NOT
SEE
AN
OPEN
MIND
WHAT
I
DO
SEE
IS
MISUNDERSTANDING
LACK
OF
KNOWLEDGE
ARROGANCE
AND
MOCKERY
PLEASE
TELL
ME
WHAT
MORE
I
CAN
DO
WHILE
STILL
REMAINING
TRUE
TO
MYSELF
BE
TRUE
TO
YOURSELF
THEN
HAVE
AN
OPEN
MIND
AND
SO
END
THE
MOCKERY
GAIN
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
REAL
GOD
PUT
YOUR
PRESUMPTIONS
ASIDE
READ
THE
BIBLE
AND
KNOW
THAT
THERE
IS
TRULY
IS
A
REASON
FOR
EVERYTHING
AND
THERE
EXISTS
A
GOD
THAT
HAS
SO
MUCH
LOVE
FOR
YOU
THAT
THE
DEPTH
OF
IT
GOES
BEYOND
OUR
SHALLOW
WORLDLY
EXPERIENCE
A
PERSON
WHO
COMMITS
HIMSELF
TO
SEEKING
GOD
WILL
FIND
GOD
JESUS
STANDS
AT
YOUR
DOOR
AND
KNOCKS
BUT
A
PERSON
WHO
HALFHEARTEDLY
OPENS
THE
BIBLE
OR
OPENS
IT
WITH
PURPOSE
TO
FIND
SOMETHING
TO
MOCK
WILL
FIND
LEARN
AND
SEE
NOTHING
THE
ONLY
THING
ONE
WILL
GAIN
WITH
THAT
ATTITUDE
IS
FOLLY
BE
CAREFUL
TO
NOT
JUMP
THE
GUN
FOR
AT
FIRST
GLANCE
THERE
ARE
MANY
PASSAGES
IN
THE
BIBLE
THAT
WILL
SEEM
BIZARRE
AND
ABSURD
BE
ASSURED
THAT
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
SEEM
ALIEN
AT
FIRST
BE
CONFIDENT
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
BE
ASSURED
THAT
BEYOND
YOUR
PRESENT
COMPREHENSION
THERE
LIES
SUCH
DEEP
REASONS
THAT
ONCE
YOU
SEE
THEM
YOU
WILL
INDEED
BE
SATISFIED
I
WILL
PERSONALLY
GUARANTEE
THAT
ONE
AS
JESUS
PUT
IT
YOU
WILL
NEVER
BE
THIRSTY
AGAIN
YOUR
CUP
WILL
EVEN
FLOW
OVER
FROM
KING
SOLOMON
BC
TO
BC
IT
IS
THE
GLORY
OF
GOD
TO
CONCEAL
A
MATTER
TO
SEARCH
OUT
A
MATTER
IS
THE
GLORY
OF
KINGS
JESUS
SAYS
IN
JOHN
NO
ONE
CAN
COME
TO
ME
UNLESS
THE
FATHER
WHO
SENT
ME
DRAWS
HIM
AND
IN
JOHN
FOR
GOD
SO
LOVED
THE
WORLD
THAT
HE
GAVE
HIS
ONE
AND
ONLY
SON
THAT
WHOSOEVER
BELIEVES
IN
HIM
SHALL
NOT
PERISH
BUT
HAVE
ETERNAL
LIFE
YOU
ARE
INCLUDED
IN
WHOSOEVER
AND
I
ALSO
PRAY
THAT
THE
FATHER
IS
DRAWING
YOU
WHICH
IT
SEEMS
HE
IS
DOING
ELSE
YOU
WOULDNT
BE
POSTING
TO
TALKRELIGIONMISC
REMEMBER
BRIAN
YOU
COULD
BE
A
ST
PAUL
IN
THE
MAKING
PAUL
NOT
ONLY
MOCKED
CHRISTIANS
AS
YOU
DO
BUT
ALSO
HAD
PLEASURE
STONING
THEM
YET
GOD
SHOWED
HIM
MERCY
SAVED
HIM
AND
PAUL
BECAME
ON
OF
THE
MOST
CELEBRATED
MEN
IN
THE
HISTORY
OF
GODS
CHURCH
YOU
SEE
BRIAN
I
MYSELF
BETTER
BE
CAREFUL
AND
NOT
JUDGE
YOU
BECAUSE
YOU
COULD
INDEED
BE
THE
NEXT
PAUL
FOR
WITH
THE
FERVOR
THAT
YOU
ATTACK
CHRISTIANS
ONE
DAY
YOU
MIGHT
FIND
YOURSELF
ONE
AND
LIKE
PAUL
PROCLAIM
THE
GOOD
NEWS
OF
JESUS
WITH
THAT
VERY
SAME
FERVOR
OR
MORE
OR
YOU
COULD
BE
THE
NEXT
PETER
WHAT
JESUS
SAID
TO
PETER
JESUS
WOULD
PROBABLY
SAY
TO
YOU
SATAN
WOULD
SURELY
LIKE
TO
HAVE
YOU
WHY
SO
BECAUSE
PETER
WAS
HARDHEADED
CYNICAL
AND
DEMONSTRATED
GREAT
MOMENTS
OF
STUPIDITY
BUT
ONCE
PETER
COMMITTED
HIMSELF
TO
A
TASK
HE
DID
WITH
FULL
HEART
PETER
WAS
THE
ONLY
APOSTLE
TO
HAVE
THE
FAITH
TO
WALK
ON
WATER
AS
JESUS
DID
YOU
ASKED
WHY
NOT
BELIEVE
IN
ZEUS
ZEUS
DIDNT
OFFER
ETERNAL
LIFE
YOU
GOT
NOTHING
TO
GAIN
BY
BELIEVING
IN
ZEUS
