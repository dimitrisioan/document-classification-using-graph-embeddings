re
a
message
for
you
mr
president
how
do
you
know
what
happened
in
article
cjknetcomcom
writes
this
was
obviously
a
lot
different
than
the
ordinary
fbi
adventure
i
believe
that
the
federal
officers
had
a
conflict
of
interests
here
throught
out
the
whole
affair
it
seamed
to
me
that
they
were
chiefly
concerned
with
saving
face
rather
than
saving
lifes
its
true
that
the
bd
were
resisting
arrest
and
that
they
should
have
surrendered
when
they
first
realized
that
these
where
federal
officers
but
they
didnt
im
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
saving
face
unless
you
are
confusing
the
fbi
with
the
batf
who
are
the
ones
who
were
in
charge
of
the
original
search
warrant
but
when
they
didnt
the
fbi
should
not
have
treated
as
a
hostage
situation
it
wasnt
i
think
more
discussions
possible
independant
negotiators
and
family
intervention
should
have
been
used
independant
negotiators
what
was
there
to
negotiate
any
sort
of
plea
bargin
has
to
be
brought
to
the
court
the
negotiators
cant
negotiate
charges
or
sentences
fbi
negotitators
did
make
a
deal
for
the
dividians
to
come
out
koresh
showed
he
was
not
negotiating
in
good
faith
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
independent
negotiators
would
have
done
any
better
