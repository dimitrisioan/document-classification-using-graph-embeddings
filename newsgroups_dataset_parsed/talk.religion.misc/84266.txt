ORTHODOX
CHRISTIAN

ROBERT
WEISS
SAYS
ORTHODOX
IS
A
COMPOUND
WORD
IT
COMES
FROM
ORTHOS
STRAIGHT
TRUE
RIGHT
AND
FROM
DOXA
OPINION
DOCTRINE
TEACHING
I
USE
ORTHODOX
TO
REFER
TO
RIGHT
TEACHING
RIGHT
TEACHING
IS
DERIVED
FROM
LETTING
GOD
SPEAK
TO
US
THROUGH
THE
BIBLE
THIS
CAN
BE
FROM
READING
SIMPLE
TRUTHS
IN
THE
SCRIPTURES
AND
BY
USING
THE
BIBLE
TO
INTERPRET
THE
BIBLE
THANKS
FOR
THE
ETYMOLOGY
LESSON
BUT
I
ACTUALLY
KNOW
WHAT
ORTHODOX
MEANS
YOURE
AVOIDING
MY
QUESTION
HOWEVER
WHICH
WAS
FROM
WHAT
BODY
OF
THEOLOGY
DOES
YOUR
VERSION
OF
ORTHODOXY
COME
YOU
SEEM
TO
SIMPLY
BE
SAYING
THAT
WHATEVER
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THE
BIBLE
TO
SAY
IS
ORTHODOX
RA
WHO
IS
THAT
HOLDS
THAT
LUKE
MEANT
WHAT
YOU
SAID
HE
MEANT
I
THINK
THAT
IT
IS
APPARENT
FROM
READING
THE
SCRIPTURES
THAT
ARE
PERTINENT
YOU
ARE
OBVIOUSLY
MISTAKEN
SINCE
MANY
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
READ
THE
BIBLE
AND
MANY
DO
NOT
AGREE
WITH
YOU
ON
THIS
POINT
ONCE
AGAIN
ROBERT
IS
YOUR
INTERPRETATION
THE
ONLY
CORRECT
OR
ORTHODOX
ONE
RA
WHENEVER
YOUR
PERSONAL
INTERPRETATION
OF
BIBLICAL
PASSAGES
IS
RA
CHALLENGED
YOUR
ONLY
RESPONSE
SEEMS
TO
BE
THAT
ONE
NEEDS
MERELY
TO
RA
LOOK
AT
THE
BIBLE
IN
ORDER
TO
SEE
THE
TRUTH
BUT
WHAT
OF
THOSE
WHO
RA
SEE
BIBLICAL
THINGS
DIFFERENTLY
FROM
YOU
I
SEEM
TO
BE
SEEING
FROM
YOU
THE
NOTION
THAT
ANY
DIFFERENCE
IN
HOW
ONE
VIEWS
THE
BIBLE
IS
SOMEHOW
LEGITIMATE
EXCEPT
OR
COURSE
FOR
THE
STUFF
THAT
I
GLEAN
FROM
IT
PUT
FORWARD
A
CONTRARY
VIEW
AND
PERHAPS
WE
CAN
HAVE
A
DISCUSSION
ON
THAT
TOPIC
BUT
TO
DECRY
SOMETHING
THAT
I
PUT
FORWARD
WITHOUT
PUTTING
FORWARD
SOMETHING
ELSE
TO
DISCUSS
AND
TO
DISMISS
WHAT
I
PUT
FORWARD
WHILE
GIVING
CREDENCE
TO
OTHER
ALLEGED
VIEWS
THAT
HAVE
YET
TO
BE
PUT
FORWARD
IS
SIMPLY
BEING
CONTENTIOUS
THIS
WHOLE
STRING
BEGAN
AS
A
RESPONSE
TO
YOUR
ATTACKS
ON
MORMONISM
NO
ONE
IS
ATTACKING
YOUR
PERSONAL
BELIEFS
ONLY
YOUR
TENDENCY
TO
PRESENT
THEM
AS
ORTHODOXY
I
DONT
MUCH
CARE
WHAT
YOU
BELIEVE
ABOUT
THE
BIBLE
JUST
DONT
PRESENT
YOU
PERSONAL
UNDERSTANDING
AS
THE
ONLY
ORTHODOX
ONE
RA
ARE
WE
TO
SIMPLY
ASSUME
THAT
YOU
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
REALLY
RA
UNDERSTANDS
IT
IF
YOU
BELIEVE
THAT
SOMETHING
THAT
I
HAVE
DRAWN
FROM
SCRIPTURE
IS
WRONG
THEN
PLEASE
SHOW
ME
FROM
SCRIPTURE
WHERE
IT
IS
WRONG
SIMPLY
STATING
THAT
THERE
ARE
OTHER
VIEWS
IS
NOT
A
PROOF
SHOW
IT
TO
ME
FROM
SCRIPTURE
AND
THEN
WE
CAN
GO
ON
I
HAVE
NEVER
ATTACKED
YOUR
SPECIFIC
BELIEFS
THATS
YOUR
APPROACH
REMEMBER
STATING
THAT
OTHER
PEOPLE
WHO
DEPEND
SOLELY
ON
THE
BIBLE
HAVE
OTHER
VIEWS
IS
INDEED
PROOF
THAT
THE
BIBLE
CAN
BE
INTERPRETED
MANY
WAYS
WHICH
HAS
BEEN
MY
WHOLE
POINT
ALL
ALONG
THE
SPECIFICS
OF
YOUR
BELIEF
ARE
YOUR
BUSINESS
JUST
DONT
PRETEND
THAT
THEY
ARE
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
YOUR
PERSONAL
INTEPRETATION
AND
BE
CAREFUL
ABOUT
CRYING
HERESY
BASED
ON
YOUR
PRIVATE
BELIEF
SYSTEM
