RE
IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED
BRIANLPLARIZONAEDU
BRIAN
CECCARELLI
WRITES
SO
WHAT
IS
YOUR
BEEF
AGAINST
JESUS
FIRST
AND
FOREMOST
I
HONESTLY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
JESUS
WAS
ANYTHING
MORE
THAN
A
MAN
WHO
LIVED
AND
DIED
TWO
THOUSAND
YEARS
AGO
I
KNOW
YOUR
BIBLE
PROVIDES
WONDERFUL
STORIES
OF
THE
THINGS
HE
SAID
AND
DID
BUT
I
SIMPLY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
HE
STILL
EXISTS
AS
AN
ENTITY
THAT
HAS
ANY
BEARING
ON
THIS
UNIVERSE
OR
THE
LIVES
IN
IT
AND
I
SIMILARLY
DO
NOT
BELIEVE
THAT
THE
GOD
THAT
YOU
WORSHIP
EXISTS
OR
HAS
EVER
EXISTED
PERIOD
I
VIEW
RELIGION
IN
GENERAL
AND
CHRISTIANITY
IN
SPECIFIC
AS
A
CULTURAL
VIRUS
THAT
HAS
BEEN
PASSED
DOWN
FROM
GENERATION
TO
GENERATION
BECAUSE
PEOPLE
ARE
OFTEN
TOO
AFRAID
TO
THINK
FOR
THEMSELVES
AND
CLAIM
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR
THEIR
OWN
FATE
SO
THEY
BRAINWASH
THEMSELVES
AND
THEIR
CHILDREN
INTO
BELIEVING
THE
POPULAR
MYTHS
AND
IT
GOES
ON
FROM
THERE
AND
EVENTUALLY
CHRISTIANITY
BECOMES
A
GIVEN
IF
SO
MANY
OTHER
PEOPLE
BELIEVE
IN
IT
IT
MUST
BE
RIGHT
NO
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
ANY
LIFE
AFTER
DEATH
I
BELIEVE
THAT
WHEN
I
DIE
I
DIE
SO
THEREFORE
ITS
UP
TO
ME
TO
TRY
TO
BRING
MEANING
AND
PURPOSE
TO
MY
LIFE
IN
THE
MEANTIME
I
DONT
BELIEVE
THAT
ITS
A
GOOD
THING
TO
HUMBLE
MYSELF
AND
VIEW
PRIDE
AS
A
SIN
PRIDE
IN
MODERATION
IS
A
CONSTRUCTIVE
THING
I
SEE
NOTHING
AT
ALL
WRONG
WITH
HOMOSEXUALITY
AND
NOTHING
INFERIOR
ABOUT
WOMEN
AND
MY
PRIESTS
LOST
A
LOT
OF
MY
TRUST
WHEN
THEY
PATRONIZINGLY
TRIED
TO
EXPLAIN
THE
FAULTS
OF
THESE
OPINIONS
TO
ME
I
DONT
BELIEVE
IN
LOVING
EVERYONE
ESPECIALLY
PEOPLE
IVE
NEVER
MET
WHILE
I
TRY
TO
SHOW
RESPECT
TO
EVERYONE
MY
LOVE
AND
ADMIRATION
IS
SOMETHING
NOT
EASILY
EARNED
AND
I
DO
NOT
FEEL
GUILTY
ABOUT
DENYING
MY
RESPECT
AND
CONSIDERATION
TO
SOMEONE
WHO
HAS
ABUSED
IT
IF
YOU
WANT
ME
TO
TAKE
YOUR
RELIGION
THE
LEAST
BIT
SERIOUSLY
STOP
TRYING
TO
SHOW
ME
HOW
THE
BIBLE
MAKES
SENSE
START
TRYING
TO
SHOW
ME
THAT
THIS
JESUS
PERSON
IS
SOMEHOW
STILL
INFLUENCING
ANYONES
LIFE
HERE
ON
