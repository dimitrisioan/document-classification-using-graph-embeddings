WRITES
HOWEVER
ONE
HIGHLY
BIASED
ACCOUNT
AS
WELL
AS
POSSIBLY
INTERNALLY
INCONSISTENT
WRITTEN
OVER
MELLENIA
AGO
IN
A
DEAD
LANGUAGE
BY
FANATIC
DEVOTEES
OF
THE
CREATURE
IN
QUESTION
WHICH
IS
NOT
SUPPORTED
BY
OTHER
MORE
OBJECTIVE
SOURCES
AND
ISNT
EVEN
ACCEPTED
BY
THOSE
WHOS
MESSIAH
THIS
CREATURE
WAS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
DOESNT
CONVINCE
ME
IN
THE
SLIGHTEST
ESPECIALLY
WHEN
MANY
OF
THE
CURRENT
DAY
DEVOTEES
APPEAR
BRAINWASHED
INTO
BELIEVING
THIS
PILE
OF
GUANO
SINCE
YOU
HAVE
REFERRED
TO
THE
MESSIAH
I
ASSUME
YOU
ARE
REFERRING
TO
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
PLEASE
DETAIL
YOUR
COMPLAINTS
OR
EMAIL
IF
YOU
DONT
WANT
TO
POST
FIRSTCENTURY
GREEK
IS
WELLKNOWN
AND
WELLUNDERSTOOD
HAVE
YOU
CONSIDERED
JOSEPHUS
THE
JEWISH
HISTORIAN
WHO
ALSO
WROTE
OF
JESUS
IN
ADDITION
THE
FOUR
GOSPEL
ACCOUNTS
ARE
VERY
MUCH
IN
HARMONY
BILL
I
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
TIME
TO
EXPLAIN
THAT
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
CONSIDER
THE
JOSEPHUS
REFERENCE
TO
BE
AN
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
INSERT
BY
BIBLICAL
SCHOLAR
I
MEAN
AN
EXPERT
WHO
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
HIS
OR
HER
RESEARCH
IS
WILLING
TO
LET
THE
CHIPS
FALL
WHERE
THEY
MAY
THIS
EXCLUDES
LITERALISTS
WHO
MAY
OTHERWISE
BE
DEFINED
AS
BIBLICAL
APOLOGISTS
THEY
FIND
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
FIND
THEY
ARE
NOT
TRUSTWORTHY
BY
SCHOLARLY
STANDARDS
AND
OTHERS
WHY
AN
INSERT
READ
IT
I
HAVE
A
NUMBER
OF
TIMES
THE
PASSAGE
IS
GLARINGLY
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
AND
JOSEPHUS
A
SUPERB
WRITER
HAD
NO
SUCH
PROBLEM
ELSEWHERE
IN
HIS
WORK
THE
PASSAGE
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
SUBJECT
MATTER
IN
WHICH
IT
LIES
IT
SUDDENLY
APPEARS
AND
THEN
JUST
AS
QUICKLY
DISAPPEARS
I
THINK
THIS
IS
A
WEAK
ARGUMENT
THE
FACT
IS
THERE
ARE
TWO
REFERENCES
TO
JESUS
IN
ANTIQUITIES
OF
THE
JEWS
ONE
OF
WHICH
HAS
UNQUESTIONABLY
AT
LEAST
BEEN
ALTERED
BY
CHRISTIANS
ORIGEN
WROTE
IN
THE
THIRD
CENTURY
THAT
JOSEPHUS
DID
NOT
RECOGNIZE
JESUS
AS
THE
MESSIAH
WHILE
THE
LONG
PASSAGE
SAYS
THE
OPPOSITE
THERE
IS
AN
ARABIC
MANUSCRIPT
OF
ANTIQUITIES
OF
THE
JEWS
WHICH
CONTAINS
A
VERSION
OF
THE
PASSAGE
WHICH
IS
MUCH
LESS
GUNGHO
FOR
JESUS
AND
MAY
BE
AUTHENTIC
THERE
IS
NO
QUESTION
THAT
ORIGEN
IN
THE
THIRD
CENTURY
SAW
A
REFERENCE
TO
JESUS
IN
JOSEPHUS
THERE
ARE
NO
MANUSCRIPTS
OF
ANTIQUITIES
WHICH
LACK
THE
REFERENCES
IT
IS
POSSIBLE
THAT
IT
WAS
FABRICATED
OUT
OF
WHOLE
CLOTH
AND
INSERTED
BUT
I
DONT
THINK
ITS
VERY
LIKELYNOR
DO
I
THINK
THERE
IS
A
CONSENSUS
IN
THE
SCHOLARLY
COMMUNITY
THAT
THIS
IS
THE
CASE
I
KNOW
GA
WELLS
TAKES
THIS
POSITION
BUT
THATS
BECAUSE
HE
TAKES
THE
VERY
SMALL
MINORITY
VIEW
THAT
JESUS
NEVER
EXISTED
AND
HE
IS
A
PROFESSOR
OF
GERMAN
NOT
OF
BIBLICAL
HISTORY
OR
NEW
TESTAMENT
OR
ANYTHING
DIRECTLY
RELEVANT
TO
THE
HISTORICITY
OF
JESUS
