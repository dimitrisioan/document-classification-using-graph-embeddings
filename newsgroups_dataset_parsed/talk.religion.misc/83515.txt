you
have
only
pushed
back
the
undefined
meaning
you
must
now
define
what
objective
values
are
really
you
dont
know
what
objective
value
is
if
i
offered
the
people
of
the
us
collectively
for
all
of
the
land
in
america
would
that
sound
like
a
good
deal
you
mean
that
if
you
can
find
a
ridiculous
price
the
rest
of
us
are
supposed
to
conclude
that
an
objectively
correct
price
exists
i
said
nothing
about
the
price
i
asked
if
the
deal
was
good
it
isnt
so
it
was
a
complete
nonsequitur
is
that
it
how
does
coming
up
with
a
derisory
deal
tell
us
anything
about
the
existence
of
objective
values
youre
asking
us
to
accept
that
the
deal
you
offered
would
be
turned
down
and
we
believe
that
not
because
we
appeal
to
objective
values
but
becasue
we
know
or
think
we
know
something
about
people
all
the
people
we
know
exhibit
subjective
values
that
would
lead
them
to
reject
a
deal
of
for
all
of
the
land
in
america
great
now
so
what
