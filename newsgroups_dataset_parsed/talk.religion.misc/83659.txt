it
is
true
what
you
stated
above
jesus
saving
grace
is
available
to
everyone
not
just
jews
in
other
words
everyone
can
have
salvation
but
not
everyone
will
this
option
is
now
open
to
people
other
than
just
jews
of
course
if
the
jews
dont
accept
the
deity
of
christ
i
would
hardly
expect
them
to
accept
anything
that
christ
said
but
i
dont
feel
any
animosity
towards
them
even
though
they
persecuted
jesus
and
his
disciples
and
eventually
crucified
him
i
bear
them
no
ill
will
if
anything
i
feel
pity
for
them
jesus
had
to
die
to
pay
the
price
for
our
sins
and
so
the
jews
were
merely
fulfilling
prophesy
jesus
knew
he
had
to
die
even
before
he
began
his
ministry
that
demonstrates
the
great
depth
of
his
love
for
us
jesus
certainly
demonstrated
the
great
depth
of
his
love
for
the
children
who
died
today
at
the
davidian
complex
sorry
but
the
events
today
made
me
even
more
negative
concering
organized
religion
i
understand
and
sympathize
with
your
pain
what
happened
in
waco
was
a
very
sad
tradgedy
dont
take
it
out
on
us
christians
though
the
branch
davidians
were
not
an
organized
religion
they
were
a
cult
led
by
a
egomaniac
cult
leader
the
christian
faith
stands
only
on
the
shoulders
of
one
man
the
lord
of
lords
and
king
of
kings
jesus
christ
btw
david
koresh
was
not
jesus
christ
as
he
claimed
god
be
with
you
