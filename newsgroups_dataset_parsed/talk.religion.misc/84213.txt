DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
I
HAVE
COME
TO
ABOLISH
THE
LAW
OR
THE
PROPHETS
I
HAVE
NOT
COME
TO
ABOLISH
THEM
BUT
TO
FULFILL
THEM
I
TELL
YOU
THE
TRUTH
UNTIL
I
WILL
CLARIFY
MY
EARLIER
QUOTE
GODS
LAWS
WERE
ORIGINALLY
WRITTEN
FOR
THE
ISRAELITES
JESUS
CHANGED
THAT
FACT
BY
NOW
MAKING
THE
LAW
APPLICABLE
TO
ALL
PEOPLE
NOT
JUST
THE
JEWS
GENTILES
COULD
BE
PART
OF
THE
KINGDOM
OF
HEAVEN
THROUGH
THE
SAVING
GRACE
OF
GOD
I
NEVER
SAID
THAT
THE
LAW
WAS
MADE
OBSOLETE
BY
JESUS
IT
WASNT
JESUS
WHO
CHANGED
THE
RULES
OF
THE
GAME
