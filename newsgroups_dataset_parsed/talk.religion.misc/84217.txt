be
placed
before
the
judgement
seat
eventually
and
judged
on
what
we
have
done
or
failed
to
do

this
earth
god
allows
people
to
choose
who

what
they
want
to
worship

hey
i
understand
vaxen
and
vms
thats
what
i
get
paid
for
my
understanding
of
astronomy
is
purely
at
the
amateur
level
or
below
so
unless
what
im
saying
is
directly
related
to
vaxvms
dont
hold
me
or
my
organization
responsible
for
it
if
it
is
related
to
vaxvms
you
can
try
to
hold
me
responsible
for
it
but
my
organization
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
