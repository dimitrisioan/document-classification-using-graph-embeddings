ROBERT
WEISS
SAYS
JUST
BRIEFLY
ON
SOMETHING
THAT
YOU
MENTIONED
IN
PASSING
YOU
REFER
TO
DIFFERING
INTERPRETATIONS
OF
CREATE
AND
SAY
THAT
MANY
CHRISTIANS
MAY
NOT
AGREE
SO
WHAT
THAT
IS
REALLY
IRRELEVANT
WE
DO
NOT
BASE
OUR
FAITH
ON
HOW
MANY
PEOPLE
THINK
ONE
WAY
OR
ANOTHER
DO
WE
THE
BOTTOM
LINE
IS
TRUTH
REGARDLESS
OF
POPULARITY
OF
OPINIONS
IM
SORRY
I
THOUGHT
WE
WERE
DISCUSSING
HERESY
I
ASSUMED
THAT
HERESY
MEANT
A
DEPARTURE
FROM
ORTHODOXY
IN
WHICH
CASE
GENERALLY
ACCEPTED
BELIEF
IS
INDEED
AN
IMPORTANT
ISSUE
IN
THIS
CASE
THE
DEFINITION
OF
THE
WORD
CREATE
IS
OF
GREAT
IMPORTANCE
SINCE
CREATION
IS
THE
ISSUE
BEING
DISCUSSED
ALSO
I
FIND
IT
RATHER
STRANGE
THAT
IN
TRYING
TO
PERSUADE
THAT
CREATED
AND
ETERNALLY
EXISTENT
ARE
EQUIVALENT
YOU
SAY
GRANTED
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
YOU
CANT
GRANT
YOUR
CONCLUSION
AND
THEN
EXPECT
THE
POINT
TO
HAVE
BEEN
ADDRESSED
IN
ORDER
TO
REPLY
TO
THE
ISSUE
YOU
HAVE
TO
ADDRESS
AND
ANSWER
THE
POINT
THAT
WAS
RAISED
AND
NOT
JUST
JUMP
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
YOU
GRANT
I
SHOULD
HAVE
SAID
GIVEN
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
IF
YOU
DISAGREE
WITH
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
THAT
CREATION
IS
MORE
A
FUNCTION
OF
ORGANIZATION
OF
ETERNALLY
EXISTENT
SUBSTANCE
THAN
ONE
OF
EX
NIHILO
CREATION
THEN
THAT
IS
THE
IMPORTANT
POINT
THE
BIBLE
STATES
THAT
LUCIFER
WAS
CREATED
THE
BIBLE
STATES
THAT
JESUS
IS
THE
CREATOR
OF
ALL
THE
CONTRADICTION
THAT
WE
HAVE
IS
THAT
THE
LDS
BELIEF
IS
THAT
JESUS
AND
LUCIFER
WERE
THE
SAME
CORRECTION
YOU
INTERPRET
THE
BIBLE
TO
MEAN
SOMETHING
VERY
SPECIFIC
BY
SUCH
TERMS
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
IS
THAT
ALL
ARE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
LITERALLY
THERE
IS
NOTHING
SYMBOLIC
ABOUT
IT
THIS
HOWEVER
CONTRADICTS
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
THAT
NOT
EVERYONE
IS
A
CHILD
OF
GOD
IT
ALWAYS
CRACKS
ME
UP
WHEN
ANTIMORMONS
PRESUME
TO
TELL
MORMONS
WHAT
THEY
BELIEVE
MORMONS
DO
IN
FACT
BELIEVE
THAT
ALL
PEOPLE
INCLUDING
CHRIST
AND
LUCIFER
ARE
CHILDREN
OF
GOD
IN
THE
SENSE
THAT
WE
WERE
ALL
CREATED
OR
ORGANIZED
OR
WHATEVER
BY
HIM
WE
ALSO
BELIEVE
THAT
BEING
OFFSPRING
OF
GOD
HAS
A
SYMBOLIC
SENSE
WHEN
APPLIED
TO
BEING
SPIRITUALLY
BORN
AGAIN
OF
HIM
THUS
THE
SAME
WORD
CAN
BE
USED
TO
CONVEY
DIFFERENT
MEANINGS
THIS
IS
HOW
LANGUAGE
WORKS
ROBERT
AND
ITS
WHY
MAKING
SOMEONE
AN
OFFENDER
FOR
A
WORD
IS
DANGEROUS
THIS
IS
REALLY
A
RED
HERRING
IT
DOESNT
ADDRESS
ANY
ISSUE
RAISED
BUT
RATHER
IT
SEEKS
TO
OBFUSCATE
THE
FACT
THAT
SOME
GROUPS
TRY
TO
READ
SOMETHING
INTO
THE
BIBLE
DOESNT
CHANGE
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
FOR
WE
FIRST
LOOK
TO
THE
BIBLE
TO
SEE
WHAT
IT
TEACHES
TO
DISCOUNT
OR
NOT
EVEN
ADDRESS
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
BECAUSE
THERE
ARE
SOME
GROUPS
THAT
HAVE
DIFFERING
VIEWS
IS
SELFDEFEATING
TO
SEE
WHAT
THE
BIBLE
TEACHES
YOU
HAVE
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
BIBLE
ON
THE
CONTRARY
ROBERT
IT
IS
NOT
A
RED
HERRING
AT
ALL
TO
SHOW
THAT
THOSE
WHO
RELY
WHOLLY
ON
THE
BIBLE
CANNOT
SEEM
TO
AGREE
ON
WHAT
IT
SAYS
YOU
SAY
THAT
ONE
MUST
SIMPLY
LOOK
AT
THE
BIBLE
TO
SEE
WHAT
IT
TEACHES
BUT
CENTURIES
OF
PEOPLE
DOING
JUST
THAT
HAVE
THAT
NO
ONE
IS
REALLY
SURE
WHAT
IT
SAYS
ARE
WE
TO
BELIEVE
THAT
YOU
ARE
THE
ONLY
ONE
WHO
REALLY
UNDERSTANDS
THE
SCRIPTURES
I
FIND
THIS
RATHER
CURIOUS
WHEN
I
MENTIONED
THAT
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
IS
THAT
JESUS
NEEDED
TO
BE
SAVED
I
PUT
FORWARD
SOME
QUOTES
FROM
THE
LATE
APOSTLE
BRUCE
MCCONKIE
THE
CURIOUS
PART
IS
THAT
NO
ONE
ADDRESSED
THE
ISSUE
OF
JESUS
NEEDING
TO
BE
SAVED
RICK
COMES
THE
CLOSEST
WITH
HIS
I
HAVE
MY
OWN
CONCLUSIONS
TO
ADDRESSING
THE
POINT
LET
ME
CLARIFY
THIS
ONE
MORE
TIME
YOU
DID
NOT
REFER
TO
THE
MORMON
BELIEF
THAT
JESUS
NEEDED
TO
BE
SAVED
BUT
RATHER
TO
MCCONKIES
BELIEF
IN
SAME
WE
KEEP
TRYING
TO
POINT
OUT
TO
YOU
THAT
BRUCE
MCCONKIE
IS
NOT
THE
SOURCE
OF
MORMON
DOCTRINE
AND
YOU
KEEP
IGNORING
IT
SEE
BELOW
MOST
OF
THE
OTHER
REPLIES
HAVE
INSTEAD
HOPSCOTCHED
TO
THE
ISSUE
OF
BRUCE
MCCONKIE
AND
WHETHER
HIS
VIEWS
WERE
OFFICIAL
DOCTRINE
I
DONT
THINK
THAT
IT
MATTERS
IF
MCCONKIES
VIEWS
WERE
CANON
THAT
IS
NOT
THE
ISSUE
WERE
MCCONKIES
WRITINGS
INDICATIVE
OF
MORMON
BELIEF
ON
THIS
SUBJECT
IS
THE
REAL
ISSUE
THE
INDICATION
FROM
RICK
IS
THAT
THEY
MAY
CERTAINLY
BE
ON
THE
CONTRARY
ROBERT
IF
YOU
ARE
QUOTING
MCCONKIES
WORDS
AS
MORMON
CANON
THEN
THE
QUESTION
OF
WHETHER
THEY
ARE
CANON
OR
NOT
IS
OF
GREAT
IMPORTANCE
THE
FACT
IS
THAT
THEY
ARE
NOT
WHETHER
OR
NOT
THEY
INDICATE
GENERAL
MORMON
BELIEF
WOULD
ONLY
BE
ASCERTAINABLE
BY
INTERVIEWING
A
LARGE
NUMBER
OF
MORMONS
