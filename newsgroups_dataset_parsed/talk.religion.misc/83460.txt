OBJECTIVE
MORALITY
IS
MORALITY
BUILT
FROM
OBJECTIVE
VALUES
BUT
WHERE
DO
THOSE
OBJECTIVE

COME
FROM
HOW
CAN
WE
MEASURE
THEM
WHAT

A

A

VALUINO
FIELD
SCIENCE
THE
REAL
WORLD
HAS
ITS
BASIS
IN
VALUES
NOT
THE
OTHER
WAY
ROUND
AS
YOU
WOULD
WISH
IT
IF
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
OBJECTIVE
VALUE
THEN
SCIENCE
CAN
NOT
OBJECTIVELY
BE
SAID
TO
BE
MORE
USEFUL
THAN
A
KICK
IN
THE
HEAD
SIMPLE
THEORIES
WITH
ACCURATE
PREDICTIONS
COULD
NOT
OBJECTIVELY
BE
SAID
TO
BE
MORE
USEFUL
THAN
A
SET
OF
TAROT
CARDS
YOU
LIKE
THOSE
CONCLUSIONS
I
DONT
I
THINK
THAT
YOU
ARE
CHANGING
THE
MEANING
OF
VALUES
HERE
PERHAPS
IT
IS
TIME
TO
BACKTRACK
AND
TAKE
A
LOOK
AT
THE
WORD
VALUE
N
A
FAIR
EQUIVALENT
OR
RETURN
FOR
SOMETHING
SUCH
AS
GOODS
OR
SERVICE
MONETARY
OR
MATERIAL
WORTH
WORTH

MEASURED
IN
USEFULNESS
OR
IMPORTANCE

THE

OR

A

DEFINITION
FOUR
SEEMS
TO
FIT

IN
TERMS
OF
SCIENTIFIC
USAGE
DEFINITIONS
SIX
OR
EIGHT
MIGHT
APPLY
NOTE
THAT
THESE
DEFINITIONS
DO
NOT
MEAN
THE
SAME
THING
IN
MY
MIND
TO
SAY
THAT
SCIENCE
HAS
ITS
BASIS
IN
VALUES
IS
A
BIT
OF
A
REACH
SCIENCE
HAS
ITS
BASIS
IN
OBSERVABLE
FACT
EVEN
THE
USAGES
OF
THE
WORD
VALUE
ABOVE
DO
NOT
DENOTE
OBSERVABLE
FACT
BUT
RATHER
A
STANDARD
OF
MEASUREMENT
I
WOULD
CONCLUDE
THAT
SCIENCE
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ITS
BASIS
IN
VALUES
AND
SO
YOUR
STATEMENT
ABOVE
FAILS
IN
FACT
IF
ONE
CONCLUDES
THAT
A
SCIENTIFIC
SET
OF
MEASUREMENTS
VALUES
ARE
BASED
ON
SYSTEMS
DERIVED
FROM
OBSERVATION
THEN
IT
MUST
FOLLOW
THAT
IN
A
SCIENTIFIC
CONTEXT
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
THERE
IS
NO
SUCH
THING
AS
OBJECTIVE
VALUES
BACK
TO
THE
PRESENT
THIS
HAS
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
A
MORAL
SYSTEM
ANYHOW
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
WORD
VALUES
IS
USED
IN
BOTH
CONTEXTS
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
THERE
IS
A
RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN
THE
TWO
CONTEXTS
IF
ONE
IS
TO
ARGUE
FOR
OBJECTIVE
VALUES
IN
A
MORAL
SENSE
THEN
ONE
MUST
FIRST
START
BY
DEMONSTRATING
THAT
MORALITY
ITSELF
IS
OBJECTIVE
CONSIDERING
THE
MEANING
OF
THE
WORD
OBJECTIVE
I
DOUBT
THAT
THIS
WILL
EVER
HAPPEN
SO
BACK
TO
THE
ORIGINAL
QUESTION
AND
OBJECTIVE
MORALITY
IS
IF
YOU
CAN
PROVIDE
AN
OBJECTIVE
FOUNDATION
FOR
MORALITY
THEN
THAT
WILL
BE
A
GOOD
BEGINNING
