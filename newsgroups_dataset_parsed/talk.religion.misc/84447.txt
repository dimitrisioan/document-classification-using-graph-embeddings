IS
IT
GOOD
THAT
JESUS
DIED
BRIAN
CECCARELLI
PRESENTS
US
WITH
THE
FALLACY
OF
FALSE
DICHOTOMY
IN
STATING
THAT
WE
MUST
ACCEPT
EVERY
THING
IN
THE
BOOKS
ATTRIBUTED
TO
PETER
OR
WE
MUST
DISCOUNT
EVERY
OTHER
BOOK
OF
ANTIQUITY
PETER
DIED
TWO
MILLENIA
AGO
THE
ORIGINAL
LETTERS
HE
WROTE
HAVE
LONG
SINCE
DECAYED
INTO
DUST
IF
HE
WERE
ALIVE
TODAY
AND
I
COULD
DO
YOU
QUESTION
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ALEXANDER
THE

TILGRATH
PILISAR
III
NERO
CALIGULA
JOSEPHUS
CYRUS
THE

TOO
BRIAN
WHY
ANOTHER

MR
CECCARELLI
YOU
SEEM
TO
BE
STATING
THAT
WE
MUST
ACCEPT
ACCEPT
EVERYTHING
WRITTEN
IN
EVERY
HISTORICAL
DOCUMENT
SOMEHOW
I
DOUBT
DO
THAT
YOURSELF
THAT
THUS
SINCE
I
DOUBT
YOU
ACCEPT
EVERYTHING
WRITTEN
IN
EVERY
HISTORICAL
DOCUMENT
I
WOULD
ASK
HOW
YOU
CAN
THEREBY
OBJECTIVELY
JUSTIFY
COMPLETE
FAITH
IN
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
BOOKS
ATTRIBUTED
TO
PETER
I
SHALL
NOW
GIVE
AN
EXAMPLE
OF
A
DOCUMENT
FROM
ANTIQUITY
WHICH
I
AM
SURE
YOU
REJECT
IT
DATES
FROM
THE
TIME
OF
RAMSES

THIS
WAS
FIRST
PRESENTED
HERE
BY
MATTHEW
WIENER
THESE
INSCRIPTIONS
WERE
CARVED
SOON
AFTER
A
BATTLE
AND
WERE
CARVED
WITH
THE

OF
KADESH
CIRCA
BC

OCCURRED
ON

BATTLE
WITH
THE
HITTITES
AND

HIS
VICTORY
INSCRIBED
ALL
OVER
THE
PLACE
A
FEW
OF
OF
THESE
INSCRIPTIONS
HAVE
SURVIVED
IN
NEAR
PERFECT
FORM
IT
IS
A
RECORD
OF
HOW
THE
PHAROAH
PRETTY
MUCH
SINGLEHANDEDLY
DEFEATED
THE
HITTITES
AFTER
BEING
SEPARATED
FROM
HIS
TROOPS

TO
FALL
ON
THEIR
FACES

AS
CROCODILES
FALL
INTO

LIKE
A
GRIFFIN
I
ATTACKED
ALL
THE
COUNTRIES
I
ALONE
FOR
MY
INFANTRY
AND
MY

DIVINE
WORD
BUT
ALSO
THAT
THERE
WERE
THOUSANDS
OF
WITNESSES
TO
THE
EVENT
NOW
FROM
THE
HEART
OF
BATTLE
THEN
HIS
MAJESTY
DROVE
AT
A
GALLOP
AND
CHARGED
THE
FORCES
OF
THE
FOE
FROM
HITTI
BEING
ALONE
BY
HIMSELF
NONE

NO
CHARIOTEER
NO
SOLDIER
OF
THE
ARMY
NO

IT
RIGHT
FOR
A

IGNORE
HIS
SON
ARE
MY
DEEDS
A
MATTER
FOR
YOU
TO
IGNORE
DO
I
NOT
WALK
AND
STAND
AT
YOUR
WORD
I
HAVE
NOT
NEGLECTED
AN
ORDER
YOU
GAVE
TOO
GREAT
IS
HE
THE
GREAT
LORD
OF
EGYPT
TO
ALLOW
ALIENS
TO
STEP
ON
HIS
PATH
WHAT
ARE
THESE
ASIATICS
TO
YOU
O
AMUN
THE
WRETCHES
IGNORANT
OF
GOD
HAVE
I
NOT
MADE
FOR
YOU
MANY
GREAT
MONUMENTS
I
CALL
TO
YOU
MY
FATHER
AMUN
I
AM
AMONG
A
HOST
OF
STRANGERS
ALL
COUNTRIES
ARE
ARRAYED
AGAINST
ME
I
AM
ALONE
THERES
NONE
WITH
ME
THE
LABORS
OF
MANY
PEOPLE
ARE
NOTHING
AMUN
IS
MORE
HELPFUL
THAN
THEY
I
CAME
HERE
BY
THE
COMMAND
OF
YOUR
MOUTH
O
AMUN
I
HAVE
NOT
TRANSGRESSED
YOUR
COMMAND
NOW
THOUGH
I
PRAYED
IN
A
DISTANT
LAND
MY
VOICE
RESOUNDED
IN
SOUTHERN
THEBES
I
FOUND
AMUN
CAME
WHEN
I
CALLED
TO
HIM
HE
GAVE
ME
HIS
HAND
AND
I
REJOICED
HE
CALLED
FROM
BEHIND
AS
IF
NEAR
BY
FORWARD
I
AM
WITH
YOU
I
YOUR
FATHER
MY
HAND
IS
WITH
YOU
I
PREVAIL
OVER
A
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
MEN
I
AM
LORD
OF
VICTORY
LOVER
OF
VALOR
I
FOUND
MY
HEART
STOUT
MY
BREAST
IN
JOY
ALL
I
DID
SUCCEEDED
I
WAS
LIKE
MONT
I
SLAUGHTERED
AMONG
THEM
AT
MY
WILL
NOT
ONE
LOOKED
BEHIND
HIM
NOT
ONE
TURNED
AROUND
WHOEVER
FELL
DOWN
DID
NOT
RISE
ONE
CALLED
OUT
TO
THE
OTHER
SAYING
NO
MAN
IS
HE
WHO
IS
AMONG
US
IT
IS
SETH
GREATOFSTRENGTH
BAAL
IN
PERSON
NOT
DEEDS
OF
MAN
ARE
THESE
HIS
DOINGS
THEY
ARE
OF
ONE
WHO
IS
UNIQUE
WHO
FIGHTS
A
HUNDRED
THOUSAND
WITHOUT
SOLDIERS
AND
CHARIOTS
COME
QUICK
FLEE
BEFORE
HIM
TO
SEEK
LIFE
AND
BREATHE
AIR
FOR
HE
WHO
ATTEMPTS
TO
GET
CLOSE
TO
HIM
HIS
HANDS
ALL
HIS
LIMBS
GROW
LIMP
ONE
CANNOT
HOLD
EITHER
BOW
OR
SPEARS
WHEN
ONE
SEES
HIM
COME
RACING
ALONG
MY
MAJESTY
HUNTED
THEM
LIKE
A
GRIFFIN
I
SLAUGHTERED
AMONG
THEM
UNCEASINGLY
SO
YOU
SEE
BRIAN
WE
HAVE
A
FEW
ORIGINAL
MANUSCRIPTS
RECORDING
THE
MIRACULOUS
BATTLE
BETWEEN
THE
RAMSES
AND
THE
HITTITES
DO
YOU
REJECT
THEM
AS
BEING
COMPLETELY
TRUE
I
SUSPECT
YOU
DO
AND
IF
SO
THEN
DO
YOU
ALSO
IN
YOUR
OWN
WORDS
QUESTION
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
ALEXANDER
THE
GREAT
TILGRATH
PILISAR
III
NERO
CALIGULA
JOSEPHUS
CYRUS
THE
GREAT
ARTEXERXES
DO
YOU
ALSO
THEREBY
QUESTION
ALL
THEIR
DOCUMENTS
THATS
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
YOUR
ALL
OR
NOTHING
APPROACH
MANY
ANCIENT
PEOPLE
USED
TO
MIX
A
BIT
OF
FANCY
WITH
THEIR
FACTS
SO
FOR
YOU
TO
SAY
THAT
WE
MUST
EITHER
ACCEPT
ALL
OF
PETER
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
OR
ACCEPT
NO
RECORDS
OF
ANTIQUITY
AT
ALL
FORCES
YOU
THEREBY
TO
ACCEPT
THE
VERITY
OF
DOCUMENTS
YOU
PROBABLY
DO
NOT
FIND
COMPLETELY
CREDIBLE
AS
TO
YOUR
OTHER
ARGUMENT
THAT
SO
MANY
PEOPLE
HAVE
TESTIFIED
TO
JESUS
THAT
HE
MUST
BE
TRUE
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
JUST
PASS
OFF
ALL
THIS
TESTIMONY
AS
FICTIOUSNESS
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
CALL
THREE
THOUSAND
YEARS
WORTH
OF
TESTIMONY
FROM
SHEPHERDS
TO
IRS
AGENTS
TO
ROYAL
OFFICIALS
TO
KINGS
TO
COMPUTER
PROGRAMMERS
FICTION
WITH
A
SCOFF
OF
YOUR
KEYBOARD
WITH
NEAR
COMPLETE
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
TESTIMONIES
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
SAY
THAT
THAT
IS
ALL
COMPLETE
HOOEY
WOULD
THAT
NOT
BE
THE
MOST
AUDACIOUS
DISPLAY
OF
ARROGANCE
DO
YOU
ACTUALLY
THINK
YOU
KNOW
BETTER
THAN
KING
SOLOMON
KING
DAVID
OR
EVEN
ABRAHAM
LINCOLN
I
HAVE
THREE
POINTS
FIRST
THIS
IS
ARGUMENTUM
AD
POPULUM
IE
APPEAL
TO
POPULAR
OPINION
YOU
CANNOT
VOTE
ON
TRUTH
FOR
INSTANCE
DO
THE
MILLIONS
OF
HINDUS
PAST
AND
PRESENT
WHO
TESTIFY
TO
THE
REALITY
OF
BRAHMA
CONSTITUTE
ACTUAL
EVIDENCE
FOR
THE
EXISTENCE
OF
BRAHMA
HOW
WOULD
YOU
ANSWER
YOUR
OWN
QUESTION
IN
REGARDS
TO
THE
TESTIMONY
OF
HINDUS
WITH
A
SCOFF
OF
YOUR
KEYBOARD
WITH
NEAR
COMPLETE
IGNORANCE
OF
THE
TESTIMONIES
ARE
YOU
GOING
TO
SAY
THAT
THAT
IS
ALL
COMPLETE
HOOEY
IF
YOU
DO
SO
SCOFF
THEN
HOW
DO
YOU
OBJECTIVELY
JUSTIFY
YOUR
OWN
SPECIAL
PLEADING
SECOND
IT
IS
NOT
AT
ALL
CLEAR
THAT
KING
SOLOMON
OR
KING
DAVID
TESTIFIED
TO
JESUS
YOU
CAN
CLAIM
IT
TO
BE
CLEAR
BUT
THAT
DOES
NOT
MAKE
IT
TRUE
THIRD
IT
IS
QUITE
ARGUABLE
THAT
ABRAHAM
LINCOLN
WAS
NOT
CHRISTIAN
AND
THAT
HE
HAD
BOTH
A
PUBLIC
AND
A
PRIVATE
VIEW
OF
CHRISTIANITY
IN
FACT
THERE
WAS
MUCH
DISCUSSION
ABOUT
IT
IN
HIS
DAY
YES
HE
WAS
PUBLICALLY
ACCUSED
OF
BEING
A
DEIST
OH
MY
I
AM
PRESENTLY
COLLECTING
A
FAQ
FOR
LINCOLN
AS
IVE
PREVIOUSLY
DONE
FOR
TYRE
JEFFERSON
AND
ETC
LATER
DAVE
BUTLER
MY
EARLIER
VIEWS
OF
THE
UNSOUNDNESS
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
SCHEME
OF
SALVATION
AND
THE
HUMAN
ORIGIN
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
HAVE
BECOME
CLEARER
AND
STRONGER
WITH
ADVANCING
YEARS
AND
I
SEE
NO
REASON
FOR
THINKING
I
SHALL
EVER
CHANGE
THEM
ABRAHAM
LINCOLN
TO
JUDGE
J
S
WAKEFIELD
AFTER
THE
DEATH
OF
WILLIE
LINCOLN
