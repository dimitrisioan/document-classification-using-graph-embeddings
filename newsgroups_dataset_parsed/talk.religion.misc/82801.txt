FRAGMENTATION
THE
PRIMARY
PROBLEM
IN
HUMAN
NATURE
IS
A
FRAGMENTATION
OF
BEING
HUMANS
ARE
IN
A
STATE
OF
TENSION
A
TENSION
OF
OPPOSITES
GOOD
AND
EVIL
ARE
THE
MOST
THOUGHT
PROVOKING
POLARITIES
THAT
COME
TO
MIND
THE
BIBLE
PROVIDES
US
WITH
MANY
EXAMPLES
OF
THE
FRAGMENTATION
OF
BEING
THE
WARRING
OPPOSITES
WITHIN
US
ARE
A
PRODUCT
OF
MANS
REBELLION
AGAINST
GOD
WHICH
IS
DESCRIBED
SO
VIVIDLY
IN
THE
PAGES
OF
THE
SCRIPTURES
MAN
WAS
CREATED
WITH
THE
ORDER
TO
BECOME
A
GOD
THOSE
WERE
THE
WORDS
OF
ST
BASIL
IN
THE
FOURTH
CENTURY
WHAT
HE
WAS
TRYING
TO
SAY
WAS
THAT
GOD
CREATED
MAN
TO
BE
A
PARTAKER
OF
THE
DIVINE
NATURE
IN
THE
EASTERN
ORTHODOX
CHURCH
THIS
IS
CALLED
THEOSIS
OR
DEIFICATION
ONE
CAN
ALSO
SAY
THAT
MAN
WAS
CREATED
TO
BE
WHOLE
IE
SPIRIT
SOUL
AND
BODY
OPERATING
IN
UNISON
THE
STORY
OF
ADAM
AND
EVE
IS
A
PICTURE
OF
THE
ARCHETYPAL
HUMANS
BEFORE
OBTAINING
MORAL
CONSCIOUSNESS
THEIRS
WAS
A
HARMONIOUS
RELATIONSHIP
WITH
EACH
OTHER
THE
WORLD
AND
THE
CREATOR
THAT
INNOCENT
HARMONY
WAS
SHATTERED
WHEN
THEY
DISOBEYED
GOD
THEIR
NATURAL
WHOLENESS
FALLING
APART
INTO
TWO
SEEMINGLY
IRRECONCILABLE
HALVES
IMMEDIATELY
GUILT
AND
FEAR
WAS
MANIFESTED
IN
THEIR
LIVES
THEY
BECOME
BOUND
TO
HARDSHIP
TOIL
AND
SUFFERING
THIS
IS
SYMBOLIZED
IN
THEIR
EXILE
FROM
THE
PARADISIAC
STATE
THE
BEAST
IN
THE
JUNGLE
DOES
NOT
POSSESS
MORAL
CONSCIOUSNESS
IF
IT
WERE
TO
RECEIVE
THIS
SELFAWARENESS
THE
KNOWLEDGE
OF
GOOD
AND
EVIL
ITS
PARADISIAC
STATE
WOULD
ALSO
BE
DESTROYED
WAS
IT
THE
INTENTION
OF
THE
CREATOR
TO
LEAVE
MAN
IN
THIS
STATE
OF
INNOCENCE
ALL
THE
DAYS
OF
HIS
EXISTENCE
ON
EARTH
OR
WAS
THE
GAINING
OF
SELFAWARENESS
CAREFULLY
STAGED
BY
GOD
WHO
DID
NOT
DESIRE
THAT
HIS
MASTERPIECE
MANKIND
BE
A
BLISSFUL
IDIOT
GOD
MUST
HAVE
KNOWN
THAT
FOR
MANKIND
TO
ACHIEVE
ANY
KIND
OF
MORAL
VALUE
HE
MUST
PASS
THROUGH
A
CONFRONTATION
WITH
THE
OPPOSITES
THERE
IS
NO
OTHER
WAY
TO
ACHIEVE
UNION
WITH
GOD
JESUS
CHRIST
IS
THE
ANSWER
TO
THE
PROBLEM
OF
THE
WARRING
POLARITIES
HE
WAS
THE
PERFECTLY
INTEGRATED
INDIVIDUAL
RECONCILING
THE
OPPOSITES
AND
MAKING
IT
POSSIBLE
FOR
US
TO
BE
INTEGRATED
IE
TO
BECOME
GOD
NOT
IN
HIS
ESSENCE
BUT
IN
HIS
ENERGIES
THE
OPPOSITES
IS
THE
CHRISTIAN
PROBLEM
THE
APOSTLE
PAUL
DESCRIBES
IT
WITH
THE
UTMOST
PRECISION
IN
ROMANS
AND
HE
FOLLOWS
WITH
THE
ANSWER
TO
HIS
DILEMMA
IN
VS
MARK
