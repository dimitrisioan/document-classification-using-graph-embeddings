THIS
IS
COMPLETE
NONSENSE
RELATIVISM
MEANS
SAYING
THAT
THERE
IS
NO
ABSOLUT
STANDARD
OF
MORALITY
IT
DOES
NOT
MEAN
SAYING
THAT
ALL
STANDARDS
OF
MORALITY
ARE
EQUALLY
GOOD
PRESUMABLY
THIS
MEANS
THAT
SOME
MORAL
SYSTEMS
ARE
BETTER
THAN
OTHERS
HOW
SO
HOW
DO
YOU
MANAGE
THIS
WITHOUT
AN
OBJECTIVE
FRAME
OF
REFERENCE

STIFF

WHICH
GOES
FASTER
A

HOW
COME
YOU
CAN
ANSWER

PROVED

SPEED
IS
A
QUANTIFIABLE
MEASURE
RESULTING
FROM
A
SET

THAT
WILL
RESULT
IN

NO

THE

A
BULLET
WITH
ZERO

SITTING

ON
A

WILL
BE
MOVING
AT
A
SPEED

TO
SOMEONE
ON
THE
TRAIN
B
TO
SOMEONE
STATIONARY
NEXT
TO
THE
TRAIN
THE
REFERENCE
FRAME
MAKES
THE
SPEED
RELATIVE
BUT
WHATS
INTERESTING
HERE
IS
THAT
EVERY
PERSON
ON
THE
TRAIN
WILL
SEE
A
STATIONARY
BULLET
EVERY
PERSON
OFF
A
BULLET
MOVING
I
KNOW
OF
NO
TRAIN
WHERE
ALL
THE
PEOPLE
ON
IT
EVERY
TIME
IT
IS
FILLED
WILL
SEE
A
MORAL
PROBLEM
IN
EXACTLY
THE
SAME
