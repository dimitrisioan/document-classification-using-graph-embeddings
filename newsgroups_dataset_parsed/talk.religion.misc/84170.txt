IN

JOHN
E
KING
WRITES
RFOXCHARLIEUSDEDU
WRITES
BILL
I
HAVE
TAKEN
THE
TIME
TO
EXPLAIN
THAT
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
CONSIDER
THE
JOSEPHUS
REFERENCE
TO
BE
AN
EARLY
CHRISTIAN
INSERT
BY
BIBLICAL
SCHOLAR
I
MEAN
AN
EXPERT
WHO
IN
THE
COURSE
OF
HIS
OR
HER
RESEARCH
IS
WILLING
TO
LET
THE
CHIPS
FALL
WHERE
THEY
MAY
THIS
EXCLUDES
LITERALISTS
WHO
MAY
OTHERWISE
BE
DEFINED
AS
BIBLICAL
APOLOGISTS
THEY
FIND
WHAT
THEY
WANT
TO
FIND
THEY
ARE
NOT
TRUSTWORTHY
BY
SCHOLARLY
STANDARDS
AND
OTHERS
IVE
SEEN
THIS
CLAIM
ABOUT
THE
JOSEPHUS
INSERT
FLYING
AROUND
THE
NET
TOO
OFTEN
TO
CONTINUE
TO
IGNORE
IT
PERHAPS
ITS
TRUE
WAS
THERE
ONLY
ONE
JOSEPHUS
MANUSCIPT
IF
THERE
WERE
SAY
COPIES
THE
FORGER
WOULD
HAVE
TO
PUT
HIS
INSERT
INTO
ALL
OF
THEM
BY
THE
SAME
TOKEN
SINCE
JOSEPHUS
WAS
A
HISTORIAN
WHY
ARE
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
RAISING
THE
FLAG
HISTORICAL
SCHOLARS
I
WOULD
THINK
WOULD
HAVE
A
BETTER
HANDLE
ON
THESE
ANCIENT
SECULAR
DOCUMENTS
CAN
YOU
GIVE
RESEARCHERS
DOCUMENTS
PAGE
NUMBERS
ETC
JACK
I
BECAME
AWARE
OF
THE
CLAIM
YEARS
AGO
SO
I
DECIDED
TO
CHECK
IT
OUT
ON
MY
OWN
BUT
THEN
THAT
WAS
IN
BN
TIMES
BEFORE
NET
SO
HERE
ARE
SOME
REFERENCES
SEE
ROBIN
LANE
FOXS
THE
UNAUTHORIZED
VERSION
WHERE
LANE
FOX
WRITES
THE
ONE
PASSAGE
WHICH
APPEARS
TO
COMMENT
ON
JESUS
CAREER
IS
AGREED
TO
BE
A
CHRISTIAN
ADDITION
IN
MY
REALBERT
SABIN
RESPONSE
TO
JIM
LIPPARD
APRIL
I
NOTED
THAT
CONSENSUS
IS
TYPICALLY
INDICATED
SUBTLY
AS
IN
ELAINE
PAGELS
THE
GNOSTIC
GOSPELS
TO
WIT
A
COMMENT
ATTRIBUTED
TO
JOSEPHUS
REPORTS
EMPHASIS
MINE
SCHOLARS
SOMETIMES
DO
NOT
EVEN
MENTION
THE
TWO
JOSEPHUS
ENTRIES
ANOTHER
SUBTLETY
REFLECTING
CONSENSUS
SO
FAR
AS
I
CAN
DEDUCE
TODAYS
CONSENSUS
IS
BUILT
ON
AT
LEAST
THREE
THINGS
THE
LONG
PASSAGE
IS
WAY
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
ORIGEN
DID
NOT
KNOW
ABOUT
THE
LONG
PASSAGE
AND
THE
SHORT
AND
LONG
PASSAGES
ARE
CONTRADICTORY
I
DONT
KNOW
THE
REFERENCES
WHEREIN
THE
ARGUMENTS
WHICH
LED
TO
CONSENSUS
ARE
ORGINALLY
DEVELOPED
DOES
ANYONE
BIBLICAL
SCHOLARS
AS
I
DEFINED
THEM
INCLUDE
THEOLOGIANS
AND
HISTORIANS
THE
FORMER
LIKE
THE
LATTER
INCORPORATE
HISTORICAL
SOCIAL
TECHNOLOGICAL
AND
IDEOLOGICAL
CONTEXTS
AS
WELL
AS
THEOLOGY
SO
THE
DISTINCTION
IS
BLURRED
I
DIDNT
ELABORATE
ON
THAT
SORRY
IN
TURN
HISTORIANS
ARE
COMPELLED
TO
INCORPORATE
THEOLOGY
CANT
SAY
ABOUT
THE
NUMBER
OF
COPIES
THESE
WERE
HOWEVER
BG
TIMES
BEFORE
GUTENBURG
A
HUNDRED
FIRST
EDITIONS
SEEMS
EXCEEDINGLY
HIGH
COUNTING
ON
ONE
HAND
SEEMS
MORE
REASONABLE
PERHAPS
THOSE
MSS
WITHOUT
THE
LONG
INSERT
IF
ANY
BECAUSE
ANYTHING
IS
POSSIBLE
HAVE
BEEN
DESTROYED
SUCH
A
PRACTICE
IS
CERTAINLY
NOT
FOREIGN
TO
RELIGIONS
ANYWAY
ALL
WE
HAVE
ARE
MSS
WHICH
HAVE
THE
TWO
ENTRIES
LIPPART
IN
THE
MESSAGE
NOTED
ABOVE
TALKS
ABOUT
AN
ARABIC
MS
BUT
HERE
THE
MS
DATE
IS
CRITICAL
