the
danger
of
anticult
groups
is
that
while
they
can
expose
a
lot
of
deception
they
can
also
become
inquisitors
as
one
who
agrees
with
much
of
what
they
say
i
am
also
on
the
receiving
end
and
it
makes
me
realize
the
importance
of
respecting
the
freedom
of
belief
of
every
individual
and
also
of
not
jumping
to
conclusions
and
making
accusations
based
on
a
priori
assumptions
about
an
individual
or
group
for
my
money
the
primary
danger
of
anticult
groups
is
that
they
are
every
bit
as
wacky
as
the
groups
they
oppose
and
that
by
and
large
they
have
no
compunctions
about
printing
lies
halftruths
and
misleading
innuendos
as
part
of
their
exposes
a
recent
book
on
cults
i
picked
up
by
a
christian
author
quite
simply
mixed
in
all
nonchristian
religions
except
the
jews
and
various
new
age
groups
with
various
fringe
groups
of
dubious
intent
and
legality
on
the
other
hand
the
watchman
fellowship
does
a
good
service
in
exposing
deceptive
practices
that
are
far
too
common
among
the
groups
they
monitor
given
the
record
of
american
christianity
any
group
that
falls
into
the
category
of
fundamentalist
or
bornagain
is
automatically
into
the
inquisition
business
it
is
an
unavoidable
affliction
of
those
who
have
a
proprietary
license
on
the
truth
tm
and
lets
not
forget
that
jonestown
and
the
branch
davidians
are
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
christian
tradition
as
the
missouri
synod
lutherans
and
may
in
fact
be
the
massadas
of
true
christian
believers
i
am
far
more
concerned
about
the
encroachment
of
overtly
christian
indoctrination
into
public
schools
than
i
am
about
yoga
classes
there
for
those
concerned
with
religious
freedom
without
a
selective
inquisitiorial
bent
