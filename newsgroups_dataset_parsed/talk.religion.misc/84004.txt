there
evidently
was
a
feast
of
bread
and
wine
associated
with
mithras
i
have
often
wondered
if
yeshua
intentionally
introduced
this
ritual
to
expand
the
appeal
of
his
religion
or
if
it
was
appropriated
by
later
worshipers
you
could
argue
that
if
you
wanted
but
i
think
a
more
reasonable
argument
would
point
out
the
fact
that
the
remembrance
feast
was
very
similar
to
the
pesach
passover
meal
during
seder
a
very
jewish
ritual
the
fact
that
there
appears
to
be
an
abuse
in
the
early
church
of
people
eating
too
much
a
very
real
concern
with
some
passover
meals
and
not
treating
the
meal
with
respect
shows
the
simplifying
of
the
ritual
to
just
bread
and
wine
to
be
a
way
of
dealing
with
the
inherent
problems
of
peoples
human
nature
and
trying
to
keep
the
essentials
of
the
remembrance
aspects
