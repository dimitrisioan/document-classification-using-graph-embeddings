RE
CECIS
ROSICRUCIAN
ADVENTURE
TONY
ALICIA
WRITES
LETS
START
WITH
THE
NAME
ROSICRUCIAN
I
TOOK
ME
A
LONG
TIME
TO
COME
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
A
MEMBER
OF
A
ROSICRUCIAN
BODY
AND
BEING
A
ROSICRUCIAN
SO
WHEN
YOU
SAY
THAT
YOU
MET
SOME
ROSICRUCIANS
YOU
MEAN
MEMBERS
OF
A
GROUP
THAT
CALLS
THEMSELVES
ROSICRUCIAN
AT
LEAST
THAT
IS
WHAT
YOUR
OBSERVATION
SUGGESTS
RESPONSE
THIS
MAKES
MUCH
SENSE
TO
ME
THIS
IS
ALSO
TRUE
OF
MOST
RELIGIONS
THERE
IS
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
BEING
A
MEMBER
OF
A
GROUP
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
CALL
THEMSELVES
HINDUS
OR
CHRISTIANS
OR
PAGANS
AND
ACTUALLY
BEING
ANY
OF
THESE
THE
SOCIAL
GROUPS
TEND
TO
MAKE
VERY
IMPORTANT
REQUIREMENTS
ABOUT
NOT
BELONGING
TO
OTHER
RELIGIONS
I
FIND
THAT
THE
IDEAL
DESCRIBED
BY
THE
HOLY
TEXTS
OF
MOST
RELIGIONS
CAN
BE
INTERPRETED
IN
VERY
SIMILAR
WAYS
SO
THAT
ONE
COULD
PRESUME
THAT
MYSTICISM
IS
THE
CORE
OF
EVERY
RELIGION
AND
HUXLEYS
PERENNIAL
PHILOSOPHY
IS
THE
GREAT
SECRET
CORE
OF
ALL
MYSTICAL
TRADS
TONY
ID
PREFER
IF
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
STATED
UP
FRONT
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
LECTORIUM
ROSICRUCIANUM
ONLY
BECAUSE
THEY
MAY
BE
CONFUSED
BY
SOME
READERS
OF
THIS
NEWSGROUP
WITH
THE
ROSICRUCIAN
ORDER
AMORC
BASED
THE
USA
JURISDICTION
IN
SAN
JOSE
CA
THIS
BEING
THE
RC
ORG
WITH
THE
MOST
MEMBERS
LAST
TIME
I
LOOKED
OF
COURSE
MOST
MEMBERS
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
MEAN
BEST
RESPONSE
CERTAINLY
TRUE
I
DIDNT
KNOW
THERE
WERE
ANY
GROUPS
WHICH
CALLED
THEMSELVES
ROSICRUCIANS
THAT
DIDNT
ASSOCIATE
WITH
AMORC
SURE
IVE
HEARD
ALL
THE
HUBBUB
ABOUT
THE
GOLDEN
DAWN
AND
ROSAE
CRUCIS
IN
RELATION
TO
ALL
THESE
WESTERN
ESOTERIC
GROUPS
BUT
HADNT
HEARD
ABOUT
OTHER
ROSICRUCIANS
ILL
ADMIT
MY
BIAS
I
LIVE
IN
SAN
JOSE
TONY
YOULL
HAVE
TO
TRUST
ME
WHEN
I
TELL
YOU
THAT
IF
THAT
LECTURECLASSWHATEVER
HAD
BEEN
PRESENTED
BY
AMORC
IT
IS
UNLIKELY
THAT
YOU
WOULD
HAVE
HAD
THE
SAME
IMPRESSION
IE
YOUD
PROBABLY
HAVE
HAD
A
POSITIVE
IMPRESSION
MORE
LIKELY
THAN
A
NEGATIVE
ONE
IMHO
RESPONSE
THIS
MAY
BE
SLIGHTLY
OFF
IVE
MET
SOME
OF
THESE
ROSICRUCIANS
AND
HAVE
A
COUPLE
FRIENDS
IN
AMORC
THE
STORIES
IVE
HEARD
AND
THE
SLIGHT
CONTACT
IVE
HAD
WITH
THEM
DOES
NOT
GIVE
ME
THE
HOPE
THAT
ID
BE
RECEIVED
WITH
ANY
KIND
OF
WARM
WELCOME
I
STILL
LIKE
TO
THINK
THAT
MOST
PEOPLE
WHO
ARE
INVOLVED
WITH
STRATIFIED
RELATIONSHIPS
MONOGAMY
RELIGION
ETC
ARE
IN
DEEP
PAIN
AND
HOPE
TO
HEAL
IT
WITHIN
SUCH
A
CAST
TONY
IT
IS
CURIOUS
TO
KNOW
THAT
OTHER
RC
ORDERS
IN
THE
USA
CLAIM
TO
BE
NON
SECTARIAN
RESPONSE
ID
LIKE
TO
KNOW
AT
LEAST
THE
ADDRESSES
OF
THE
OTHER
ORDERS
WHICH
CALL
THEMSELVES
ROSICRUCIANS
AND
ESPECIALLY
THOSE
WHICH
ARE
NONSECTARIAN
IS
THIS
NONSECTARIAN
LIKE
THE
MASONS
WHO
REQUIRE
THAT
A
MEMBER
BELIEVE
IN
GOD
BY
HISHER
DEFINITION
TONY
I
DONT
SEE
NOTHING
FUNDAMENTALLY
WRONG
WITH
US
CONTAINING
SOMETHING
DIVINE
AND
YES
I
DONT
LIKE
PHRASES
LIKE
ETERNAL
BLISS
EITHER
RESPONSE
LET
ALONE
US
BEING
SOMETHING
DIVINE
TONY
BTW
I
HAVE
READ
THE
INTRO
LETTERS
OF
THE
LRC
WHICH
THEY
WILL
MAIL
YOU
FREE
OF
CHARGE
RESPONSE
ADDRESSES
PHONE
NUMBERS
OF
GROUPS
IM
INTO
NETWORKING
THANKS
WILL
LOVE
IMAGINATION
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
KNOWLEDGE
