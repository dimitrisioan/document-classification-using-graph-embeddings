RE
DID
HE
REALLY
RISE
EMERY
THE
ONE
SINGLE
HISTORIC
EVENT
THAT
HAS
HAD
THE
BIGGEST
IMPACT
ON
THE
WORLD
OVER
THE
CENTURIES
IS
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
JESUS
THIS
IS
HARDLY
POSSIBLE
AS
THE
MAJORITY
OF
PEOPLE
IN
THE
WORLD
WERE
BORN
LIVED
THEIR
LIFE
AND
DIED
WITHOUT
EVER
KNOWING
ANYTHING
ABOUT
CHRIST
THE
MAJORITY
OF
THE
REST
OF
THE
WORLD
HAVE
DECIDED
THAT
HE
IS
NOT
WHO
EMERY
THINKS
HE
IS
EMERY
WHY
WERE
THE
WRITERS
OF
THE
NEW
TESTAMENT
DOCUMENTS
SO
CONVINCED
THAT
JESUS
REALLY
DID
RISE
FROM
THE
DEAD
WE
HAVE
FOUR
GOSPEL
ACCOUNTS
I
AM
LEAVING
OUT
ALL
PROOFS
OF
EMERYS
WHICH
RELY
ON
QUOTING
THE
BIBLE
AS
PROOF
CIRCULAR
REASONING
ETC
THERE
HAVE
BEEN
OCCASIONS
ALREADY
STATED
MANY
TIMES
FOR
LATER
GENERATIONS
OF
XTIANS
TO
CHANGE
EDIT
OR
OTHERWISE
ALTER
THE
BIBLE
TO
FIT
THEIR
POLITICAL
GOSPEL
AND
IF
WE
ACCEPT
THE
BIBLE
AS
TRUE
JUST
BECAUSE
THE
BIBLE
SAYS
IT
IS
TRUE
THEN
TO
BE
FAIR
WE
HAVE
TO
DO
THE
SAME
TO
THE
BHAGAVADGITA
AND
THE
KORAN
BOTH
OF
WHICH
CONTRADICT
THE
BIBLE
ENOUGH
SAID
EMERY
YET
WE
HAVE
NO
REASON
TO
BELIEVE
THESE
DISCIPLES
TO
BE
IMMORAL
AND
DISHONEST
WE
HAVE
NO
HISTORIC
INFORMATION
THAT
WOULD
LEAD
US
TO
THE
CONCLUSION
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
NOT
GODFEARING
PEOPLE
WHO
SINCERELY
AND
WHOLEHEARTEDLY
BELIEVED
THAT
THE
RESURRECTION
OF
THEIR
LORD
JESUS
WAS
A
REAL
EVENT
AND
FOR
WHAT
GAIN
WOULD
THEY
LIE
TO
MAKE
A
STAND
AT
THAT
TIME
MEANT
PERSECUTION
IMPRISONMENT
AND
PERHAPS
EVEN
DEATH
AGAIN
THIS
IS
ONLY
THE
BIBLICAL
ACCOUNT
AND
THERE
IS
NO
INDEPENDENT
PROOF
OF
ANY
OF
THIS
HAPPENING
IT
JUST
ISNT
THERE
BESIDES
SIMPLY
BEING
SINCERE
OR
WILLING
TO
DIE
FOR
YOUR
FAITH
DOES
NOT
MAKE
YOUR
FAITH
CORRECT
THERE
ARE
MUSLIMS
DYING
IN
BOSNIA
RIGHT
NOW
DOES
THE
FACT
THAT
THEY
ARE
WILLING
TO
DIE
FOR
ISLAM
MEAN
THAT
ISLAM
IS
THE
CORRECT
RELIGION
EMERY
HISTORY
BEARS
OUT
THE
PERSECUTION
OF
CHRISTIANS
ROMAN
HISTORIAN
CORNELIUS
TACITUS
GOVENOR
OF
ASIA
IN
AD
WRITING
OF
NEROS
REIGN
ALLUDED
TO
THE
TORTURE
OF
CHRISTIANS
IN
ROME
ALL
YOU
HAVE
PROVEN
IS
THAT
THESE
PEOPLE
WERE
TORTURED
FOR
THEIR
FAITH
THAT
DOES
NOT
PROVE
THAT
THEIR
FAITH
IS
TRUE
OR
CORRECT
IT
JUST
MEANS
THAT
THEY
WERE
SINCERE
IN
THEIR
BELIEFS
BEING
WILLING
TO
DIE
FOR
WHAT
YOU
BELIEVE
DOESNT
MAKE
YOUR
BELIEF
THE
TRUTH
ITS
NOT
THAT
EASY
AND
MINORITY
RELIGIONS
HAVE
ALWAYS
SUFFERED
TORTURE
MUSLIMS
SUFFER
TORTURE
AND
HARASSMENT
IN
INDIA
AND
BOSNIA
TODAY
ALL
RELIGIONS
ARE
HARASSED
IN
CHINA
TODAY
YOU
HAVENT
PROVEN
ANYTHING
SO
FAR
EMERY
WITH
ALL
THE
SUFFERING
AND
PERSECUTION
THAT
IT
MEANT
TO
BE
A
BELIEVER
IT
WOULD
BE
QUITE
PROBABLE
THAT
AT
LEAST
ONE
OF
THOSE
IN
THE
SUPPOSED
CONSPIRACY
WOULD
COME
FORWARD
AND
CONFESS
THAT
THE
WHOLE
THING
WAS
A
BIG
HOAX
NOT
IF
THEY
DIDNT
BELIEVE
THAT
IT
WAS
A
HOAX
EMERY
YET
NOT
ONE
DID
IT
SEEMS
RATHER
REASONABLE
THAT
THE
DISCIPLES
DID
NOT
MAKE
UP
THE
RESURRECTION
BUT
SINCERELY
BELIEVED
THAT
JESUS
HAD
ACTUALLY
RISEN
FROM
THE
DEAD
ESPECIALLY
IN
LIGHT
OF
THE
SUFFERINGS
THAT
CAME
UPON
THOSE
WHO
BELIEVED
THE
FOLLOWERS
OF
MUHAMMAD
FIRMLY
BELIEVED
IN
THE
MIRACLES
THAT
THE
KORAN
SAYS
MUHAMMAD
PERFORMED
THEY
WERE
ATTACKED
AND
SLAUGHTERED
FOR
THEIR
BELIEFS
THEY
DIDNT
DENOUNCE
MUHAMMAD
OR
ISLAM
IF
YOU
ARE
CORRECT
THEN
THAT
MEANS
ISLAM
IS
THE
TRUE
FAITH
YOU
SEE
HOW
STUPID
YOUR
PROOFS
ARE
