exgay
was
homosexuality
fact
fiction
tony
while
i
honestly
believe
you
believe
you
are
doing
a
good
thing
by
posting
that
piece
of
propaganda
i
believe
the
more
people
believe
that
the
more
they
will
feel
justified
in
their
blatant
persecution
of
gay
oriented
people
i
have
seen
the
film
called
the
gay
agenda
and
along
with
my
church
we
found
it
to
be
horrifying
not
because
of
what
was
actually
shown
cleaver
use
of
editting
can
create
any
image
one
wants
to
portray
rather
becaseu
we
are
familia
familiar
with
how
widely
it
was
actively
distributed
and
how
many
naive
people
are
actually
believing
the
garbage
found
within
it
the
truth
is
that
neither
you
nor
i
can
fully
speak
for
anyone
who
calls
themself
gay
but
knowing
as
many
as
i
do
and
knowing
their
testimonies
and
witnessing
thier
faith
and
life
i
have
to
say
that
the
report
you
posted
is
a
very
biased
report
something
obviously
claimed
against
gays
as
well
the
truth
is
that
unless
you
are
innately
gay
you
cannot
know
what
harm
you
are
causing
i
speak
as
an
abolitionist
who
supports
affirming
gay
rights
in
our
society
i
do
not
support
wild
sex
or
any
other
misrepresentations
perpetrated
by
christian
fundamentalist
extremists
but
i
know
people
who
are
not
the
sexual
deviants
your
report
paints
them
to
be
it
is
no
mistake
that
the
apa
removed
homosexuality
from
its
list
of
mental
illnesses
it
is
also
no
mistake
that
there
are
many
christians
and
homophobes
who
long
to
bring
it
back
to
the
list
i
do
not
feel
threatened
by
gays
i
dont
understand
why
others
are
the
following
is
an
article
concerning
two
of
the
more
popular
exgay
min
istries
exodus
international
homosexuals
anonymous
the
founder
of
an
exgay
support
group
chooses
homo
over
hetero
by
robert
pela
from
gay
oriented
magazine
advocate
in
december
david
caligiuri
received
one
of
the
advocates
homophobia
rewaa
awards
the
a
prayer
a
day
keeps
the
lust
away
citation
as
director
of
free
indeed
a
national
exgay
ministry
caligiuri
was
singled
out
for
offering
discontented
gays
and
lesbians
a
way
out
of
the
homosexual
deathstyle
through
prayer
id
like
to
give
the
award
back
caligiuri
now
laughs
im
no
longer
deserve
it
caligiuris
eight
year
involvement
with
the
national
exgay
movement
peaked
with
his
founding
of
the
phoenix
chapter
of
homosexuals
anonymous
ha
as
well
as
free
indeed
he
has
since
abandoned
his
pulpit
and
now
says
that
the
ex
gay
movement
is
a
fruitless
effort
based
on
deception
theres
no
reality
in
it
he
says
i
was
selling
a
product
and
my
product
was
a
lie
headed
up
by
national
ministries
like
exodus
international
and
courage
the
organizations
of
the
exgay
movement
rely
on
the
tenents
of
bornagain
christianity
to
convince
disatisfied
homosexuals
usually
young
gay
men
who
are
just
coming
out
that
they
can
shed
their
sexuality
by
suppressing
their
sexual
urges
and
embracing
christianity
we
offer
support
to
people
who
are
seeking
to
leave
the
sin
of
homosexuality
explains
bob
davies
director
of
exodus
he
ventures
that
about
of
those
seeking
to
abandon
their
homo
sexuality
are
men
anybody
who
is
involved
in
the
exgay
ministry
is
misguided
and
is
wasting
their
time
says
lisa
seeley
a
former
redeemed
lesbian
who
worked
with
caligiuri
as
ha
and
appeared
with
him
on
the
sally
jessy
raphael
show
these
organizations
are
for
people
who
are
spiritually
and
emotionally
wounded
its
possible
to
change
your
identity
or
your
behavior
says
sex
educator
brian
mcnaught
author
of
on
being
gay
but
its
really
impossible
to
change
your
orientation
these
people
are
no
longer
calling
themselves
gay
but
they
continue
to
have
samesex
erotic
feelings
caligiuri
says
he
founded
free
indeed
after
an
ominous
week
in
when
all
hell
broke
loose
in
his
personal
life
a
few
days
after
his
lover
ended
both
their
romance
and
their
business
partnership
caligiuri
was
sexually
assaulted
by
a
man
he
picked
up
in
a
bar
i
was
really
drunk
he
recalls
and
i
went
home
with
this
guy
he
tied
me
up
and
raped
me
he
left
me
tied
up
all
night
and
the
next
morning
he
raped
me
again
when
caligiuri
was
eventually
freed
by
the
attacker
he
returned
home
to
the
home
he
shared
with
his
exlover
he
had
another
man
there
with
him
caligiuri
recalls
i
thought
at
this
time
if
this
is
what
being
gay
is
about
i
dont
want
to
be
this
way
anymore
caligiuri
vowed
that
if
he
could
find
a
way
out
he
would
share
his
discovery
with
others
he
organized
an
antigay
contingent
to
demonstrate
at
phoenixs
gay
pride
parade
in
june
and
a
few
months
later
free
indeed
held
its
first
public
protest
at
a
meeting
to
promote
a
gay
civil
rights
ordinance
free
indeed
members
loudly
blasted
gays
telling
them
ther
were
sinners
headed
for
hell
free
indeed
began
receiving
about
a
hundred
telephone
calls
a
week
thanks
in
part
to
a
deceptive
listing
in
the
local
yellow
pages
we
were
listed
under
lesbian
and
gay
alternative
services
caligiuri
says
so
people
thought
we
were
a
gay
information
switchboard
people
would
call
to
find
out
where
the
local
bars
were
and
wed
preach
to
them
about
the
sins
of
homo
sexuality
ruses
like
this
are
typical
of
the
movement
caligiuri
says
adding
theyll
do
anything
to
reach
these
people
david
used
to
go
on
radio
and
say
really
stupid
things
recalls
peter
kelly
a
counselor
at
phoenixs
catholic
diocese
aids
program
like
that
he
knew
he
was
gay
when
he
started
wearing
pastel
colors
caligiuris
family
first
found
out
about
his
ministry
when
they
saw
him
on
raphaels
syndicated
talk
show
in
they
were
relieved
he
recalls
they
figured
that
if
they
had
to
have
a
gay
person
in
the
family
better
that
i
should
be
a
reformed
gay
person
but
caligiuri
was
hardly
reformed
by
the
time
i
appeared
on
sallys
show
id
started
having
sex
with
men
again
men
would
call
our
hotline
and
tell
me
about
thier
latest
sin
sex
with
their
pastor
sex
with
their
father
i
was
horny
all
the
time
unable
to
risk
going
to
gay
bars
where
he
might
be
recognized
from
his
numerous
television
appearances
caligiuri
says
he
used
to
go
to
bookstores
and
get
blowjobs
when
he
wasnt
working
the
bookstores
he
was
sleeping
with
other
reformed
homosexuals
i
didnt
realize
it
at
first
but
a
lot
of
the
ha
leaders
were
having
sex
with
one
another
caligiuri
says
wed
go
to
conferences
in
other
cities
and
wed
be
paired
up
in
hotel
rooms
everybody
was
sleeping
with
everybody
else
by
the
time
he
appeared
on
am
philadelphia
television
show
in
may
caligiuri
was
having
anonymous
sex
a
couple
times
a
week
when
the
shows
host
asked
him
if
he
ever
acted
on
temptation
his
answer
was
a
lie
caligiuris
duplicity
began
to
take
its
toll
on
him
however
he
was
suffering
from
chrinic
fatigue
syndrome
and
candidiasis
a
dibilitating
yeast
infection
and
this
led
to
his
escape
from
the
sect
i
was
too
sick
to
go
to
church
he
explains
the
more
time
i
spent
away
from
those
people
the
more
i
began
to
feel
like
myself
i
began
to
remember
who
i
used
to
be
late
in
caligiuri
turned
free
indeed
phone
lines
over
to
a
local
church
and
closed
the
ministrys
doors
id
convinced
myself
that
there
is
no
need
in
the
world
for
exgay
people
he
says
today
caligiuri
is
studying
alternative
spiritualities
im
interest
ed
in
belief
systems
that
arent
judgemental
considering
romance
but
not
with
a
christian
and
searching
for
a
new
project
to
devote
himself
to
i
feel
compelled
to
commit
myself
to
gay
causes
he
says
i
want
to
eventually
stop
feeling
guilty
about
what
i
did
and
make
up
for
the
damage
i
may
have
brought
to
our
community
end
article
caligiuris
tory
is
by
no
means
unique
and
i
have
read
several
other
articles
of
former
leaders
and
founders
of
exgay
ministries
who
have
said
very
similar
th
similar
things
fortuantely
not
all
of
them
have
left
christianity
but
have
come
to
realize
that
god
loves
them
despite
the
attitudes
of
others
some
like
chris
glaser
director
of
the
presbyterian
lazarus
project
of
west
hollywood
presbyterian
church
have
actually
been
working
with
the
gay
community
to
bring
them
into
the
sheepfold
of
christ
and
encouraging
real
ethical
values
of
sexuality
within
the
sphere
of
being
gay
i
have
also
as
i
said
talked
and
become
and
become
close
friends
with
many
who
once
attended
such
groups
as
love
in
action
and
others
who
either
once
claimed
to
have
been
reformed
or
who
were
too
honest
with
themselves
to
live
a
lie
no
matter
who
was
disappointed
in
them
some
were
even
encouraged
to
marry
as
a
way
of
sealing
their
new
heterosexuality
only
to
eventually
start
hitting
the
bars
bathhouses
and
bookstores
since
these
were
usually
activities
under
the
concealment
of
night
and
onenightstands
of
promiscuous
behavior
meant
no
continuous
sin
through
a
committed
relationship
this
is
a
horrible
trap
which
the
church
has
dumped
on
the
backs
of
the
truly
gay
oriented
people
and
the
very
inno
cent
victims
in
these
cases
are
the
wives
and
children
of
such
marriages
yet
the
church
insists
that
there
are
only
two
options
they
are
willing
to
allow
gay
people
heterosexuality
or
celebacy
this
is
sad
what
is
also
mrtifying
is
in
the
cases
of
those
who
cannot
suppress
their
desires
and
fear
for
thier
sanity
in
such
a
mixed
up
confusion
that
the
church
forces
on
them
they
may
even
opt
for
suicide
or
surgical
dampering
of
the
brain
functions
in
the
past
lobotomies
and
heavey
drug
suppressants
were
common
place
there
are
now
becoming
available
more
and
more
literature
on
the
threat
of
coercive
christianity
toward
gays
such
as
sylvia
penningtons
exgays
there
are
none
and
others
there
are
also
a
great
many
fact
based
books
being
written
to
help
people
trapped
in
this
confusion
such
as
maury
johnstons
gays
under
grace
and
chris
glasers
come
hom
i
seriously
recommend
those
for
people
seeking
help
for
this
persecution
and
selfacceptance
thank
you
