AND
MARRIAGE

D
BOXRUD
WRITES
I
WASNT
SURE
IF
THIS
WAS
THE
RIGHT
NEWSGROUP
TO
POST
THIS
TO
BUT
I
GUESS
THE
MISC
IS
THERE
FOR
A
REASON
HERE
GOES
I
AM
GETTING
MARRIED
IN
JUNE
TO
A
DEVOUT
WISCONSIN
SYNOD
LUTHERAN
I
WOULD
CLASSIFY
MYSELF
AS
A
STRONG
AGNOSTICWEAK
ATHIEST
THIS
HAS
BEEN
A
A
SUBJECT
OF
MANY
DISCUSSIONS
BETWEEN
US
AND
IS
REALLY
OUR
ONLY
REAL
OBSTACLE
WE
DONT
HAVE
ANY
REAL
DIFFICULTIES
WITH
THE
RELIGIOUS
DIFFERENCES
YET
BUT
I
EXPECT
THEY
WILL
POP
UP
WHEN
WE
HAVE
CHILDREN
I
HAVE
AGREED
TO
RAISE
THE
CHILDREN
NOMINALLY
LUTHERAN
THAT
IS
LUTHERAN
TRADITIONS
BUT
TRYING
TO
KEEP
AN
OPEN
MIND
I
AM
NOT
SURE
IF
THIS
IS
EVEN
POSSIBLE
THOUGH
I
FEEL
THAT
THAT
THE
WORST
QUALITY
OF
BEING
DEVOUTLY
RELIGOUS
IS
THE
LACK
OF
AN
OPEN
MIND
JUST
A
POINT
I
SUPPOSE
IF
OPEN
MIND
MEANS
BELIEVING
ANYTHING
CAN
BE
TRUE
OR
WE
CANT
FOR
SURE
KNOW
WHAT
IS
DEFINITELY
TRUE
IM
HAPPY
TO
NOT
BE
OPEN
MINDED
IF
HOWEVER
OPEN
MINDEDNESS
MEANS
BEING
RESPECTFUL
AND
TOLERANT
TOWARDS
OTHER
BELIEFS
RESPECTING
THE
RIGHTS
AND
INTELLIGENCE
AND
WISDOM
OF
PEOPLE
OF
OTHER
BELIEFS
AND
GIVING
EQUAL
TIME
TO
ALTERNATIVE
IDEAS
I
TRY
MY
VERY
BEST
TO
BE
OPEN
MINDED
JUST
A
THOT
IN
PASSING
ANYWAY
I
GUESS
ILL
GET
ON
WITH
MY
QUESTION
IS
ANYONE
IN
THE
SAME
SITUATION
AND
CAN
GIVE
SOME
SUGGESTIONS
AS
TO
HOW
TO
DEAL
WITH
THIS
WEVE
TAKEN
THE
ATTITUDE
SO
FAR
OF
JUST
TALKING
ABOUT
IT
A
LOT
AND
NOT
LETTING
ANYTHING
GET
BOTTLED
UP
INSIDE
SOMETIMES
I
GET
THE
FEELING
WERE
MAKING
THIS
MUCH
BIGGER
THAN
IT
ACTUALLY
IS
ANY
COMMENTS
WOULD
BE
GREATLY
APPRECIATED
ALSO
PLEASE
EMAIL
RESPONSES
SINCE
I
DONT
GET
A
CHANCE
TO
READ
THIS
GROUP
OFTEN
NOT
BEING
MARRIED
I
CANNOT
SAY
TOO
MUCH
TO
YOU
BUT
FROM
MY
PERSPECTIVE
HAVING
MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE
FAITHS
WOULD
BE
A
BIG
ENOUGH
ROADBLOCK
FOR
ME
IN
CONSIDERING
MARRYING
SOMEONE
MAKING
IT
MUCH
BIGGER
THAN
IT
IS
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
DEPENDS
ON
HOW
SERIOUS
EACH
OF
YOU
IS
IN
YOUR
BELIEFS
LUKEWARM
ATHEISTS
AND
CHRISTIANS
FOR
WHOM
RELIGION
IS
OF
NOMINAL
IMPORTANCE
PROBLY
WOULD
FEEL
THE
ISSUE
ISNT
VERY
BIG
I
SUPPOSE
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
YOUR
BELIEFS
ARE
TO
EACH
OF
YOU
THE
MORE
IMPORTANT
THE
ISSUE
IS
PAUL
