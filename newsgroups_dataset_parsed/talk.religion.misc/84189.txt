alapologies
if
ive
mislabelled
any
of
you
ive
only
started
reading
trm
since
the
bd
disaster
but
i
know
the
cotera
is
a
fundy
and
are
defending
koresh
and
his
beliefs
as
an
example
of
true
christianity
under
persecution
from
the
the
big
bad
secular
state
what
is
your
opinion
of
his
reported
sexual
habits
if
the
reports
are
accurate
what
iyo
does
this
say
about
the
quality
of
his
christianity
or
are
the
allegations
just
part
of
the
big
coverup
i
remain
deliberately
neutral
on
the
cause
of
the
fire
i
wouldnt
put
it
past
koresh
to
have
torched
the
place
himself
on
the
other
hand
if
the
propanetankaccident
story
is
correct
i
wouldnt
put
it
past
the
fbi
to
try
to
cover
its
ass
by
claiming
koresh
did
it
i
hope
your
government
does
a
very
thorough
investigation
of
the
whole
debacle
and
ill
be
disappointed
if
a
few
heads
dont
roll
the
authorities
seem
to
have
botched
the
original
raid
and
in
the
matter
of
the
fire
are
guilty
of
either
serious
misjudgement
or
reckless
endangerment
