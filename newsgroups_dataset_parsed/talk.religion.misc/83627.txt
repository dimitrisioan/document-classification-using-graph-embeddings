WROTE
FRANK
DECENSO
JR
WRITES
BASED
ON
THE
AMOUNT
OF
EMAIL
FROM
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
WHO
HAVE
READ
THE
POSTS
AND
TOLD
ME
I
WAS
WASTING
MY
TIME
WITH
BUTLER
AND
JOSLIN
I
TOLD
THEM
I
WASNT
DOING
IT
FOR
DB
OR
DJ
BUT
FOR
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
THEY
HAVE
TOLD
ME
THAT
DBS
AND
DJS
ARGUMENTS
WONT
CONVINCE
MOST
BIBLE
STUDYING
CHRISTIANS
SO
I
HAVE
REEVALUATED
MY
PURPOSE
HERE
AND
ITS
ALSO
CONTRIBUTED
TO
MY
DECISION
SO
MOST
BIBLESTUDYING
CHRISTIANS
WONT
BE
CONVINCED
BY
MY
ARGUMENTS
AND
THIS
IS
SUPPOSED
TO
BE
A
GOOD
THING
I
PRESUME
WHERE
DOES
THIS
MOST
BIBLE
STUDYING
CHRISTIANS
THINK
AS
FRANK
DOES
COME
FROM
AND
WHAT
IMPLIED
GOOD
ARE
YOU
DOING
FOR
OTHER
CHRISTIANS
AT
LEAST
SOME
OF
WHAT
YOU
ARE
TEACHING
HAS
BEEN
DEMONSTRATED
AS
WRONG
HAS
IT
EVER
OCCURED
TO
YOU
THAT
YOU
MAY
BE
DOING
MORE
HARM
THAN
GOOD
TO
YOUR
FELLOW
CHRISTIANS
BTW
I
USED
TO
THINK
LIKE
FRANK
DOES
I
WENT
TO
A
FUNDAMENTALIST
CHURCH
FOR
A
WHILE
I
DIDNT
START
TO
REALLY
THINK
ABOUT
WHAT
THEY
WERE
SAYING
UNTIL
I
NOTICED
A
GODS
SCIENCE
PHAMPHLET
THERE
I
READ
IT
AND
NOTICED
THAT
THE
AUTHORS
OF
IT
KNEW
VIRTUALLY
NOTHING
ABOUT
SCIENCE
I
ASKED
CHURCH
MEMBERS
SOME
QUESTIONS
ABOUT
THEORIES
FROM
THE
PHAMPHLET
AND
GOT
ONLY
DECEPTIVE
ANSWERS
I
BEGAN
TO
NOTICE
A
VERY
SIMILAR
STYLE
OF
ANSWERS
FOR
THEOLOGICAL
QUESTIONS
AS
WELL
THE
ONLY
CONCLUSION
I
COULD
REACH
WAS
THAT
THESE
PEOPLES
BELIEFS
ABOUT
THE
BIBLE
WERE
ABOUT
AS
VALID
AS
THEIR
BELIEFS
IN
THEIR
GODS
SCIENCE
PHAMPHLET
IF
THERE
ARE
STILL
PEOPLE
OUT
THERE
WHO
THINK
THAT
MY
PURPOSE
HERE
IS
TO
ATTACK
THE
BIBLE
AN
ACCUSATION
FRANK
ONCE
MADE
I
WOULD
POINT
OUT
THAT
I
HAVE
ALSO
CRITICIZED
PEOPLE
WHO
HAVE
POSTED
BIBLE
CONTRADICTIONS
THAT
TURN
OUT
TO
BE
SILLY
OUT
OF
CONTEXT
OR
EASILY
AND
LEGITIMATELY
RECONCILED
IM
NOT
ATTACKING
THE
BIBLE
BUT
INTELLECTUAL
DISHONESTY
ABOUT
THE
BIBLE
FROM
EITHER
SIDE
IF
ONE
OF
THE
PRIMARY
PURPOSES
OF
CHRISTIANS
IS
TO
SEEK
OUT
TRUTH
HOW
CAN
PEOPLE
CONDEMN
YOU
FOR
DOING
THIS
DALE
