LDS
THIEF
GOES
TO
PARADISE
KERMIT
GOES
OFF
TANGENT
KERMIT
TENSMEYER
QUOTED
FROM
A
FEW
SOURCES
AND
THEN
WROTE
SOMETHING
I
WILL
ATTEMPT
TO
CONSTRUCT
A
FACSIMILE
OF
WHAT
WAS
PREVIOUSLY
SAID
AND
THEN
ADDRESS
KERMITS
OFFERING
JOHN
REDELFS
ORIGINALLY
WROTE
JR
I
LEARNED
THAT
A
MAN
CANNOT
FRUSTRATE
JUSTICE
BY
REPENTING
ON
HIS
JR
DEATH
BED
BECAUSE
REPENTANCE
IS
MORE
THAN
A
FEELING
OF
REMORSE
IT
JR
REQUIRES
FAITH
IN
CHRIST
PROVEN
BY
FOLLOWING
HIM
BY
KEEPING
HIS
JR
COMMANDMENTS
SUCH
CANNOT
BE
ACCOMPLISHED
ON
ONES
DEATHBED
TOM
ALBRECHT
RESPONDED
TA
SO
JESUS
MUST
HAVE
LIED
TO
THE
THIEF
ON
THE
CROSS
JOHN
REDELFS
WROTE
BACK
THAT
JR
PARADISE
AND
SALVATION
ARE
NOT
THE
SAME
THING
SALVATION
IS
BETTER
JR
REFER
TO
JOHN
I
RESPONDED
TO
JOHN
THAT
RW
I
DONT
SEE
THE
EFFORT
TO
EQUATE
SALVATION
WITH
PARADISE
RW
RW
RATHER
I
SEE
IMPLIED
THE
FACT
THAT
ONLY
THOSE
WHO
ARE
SAVED
RW
MAY
ENTER
PARADISE
TO
WHICH
KERMIT
WROTE
KT
INCOMPLETE
REFERENCE
KT
KT
SEE
ALSO
THE
DISCUSSION
DID
JESUS
GO
INTO
HELL
IN
THE
BIBLESTUDY
GROUP
KT
FOR
THE
ARGUMENTS
THAT
PARADISE
AND
HELLSHEOL
ARE
PLACES
AFTER
DEATH
KT
THE
DISCUSSION
NO
LDS
WERE
INVOLVED
AS
FAR
AS
I
COULD
SEE
ARGUED
USING
KT
STANDARD
CHRISTIAN
ARGUMENT
FROM
THE
BIBLE
THAT
PRETTY
MUCH
SUPPORT
THE
KT
LDS
POSITION
KT
KT
CHRIST
WENT
TO
PARIDISE
AFTER
HIS
DEATH
AND
BURIAL
KT
KT
HE
TAUGHT
THE
PRISONERS
AND
FREED
THEM
FROM
DARKNESS
KT
KT
WHEN
HE
WAS
RESURRECTED
HE
HAD
NOT
YET
ASCENDED
TO
HIS
FATHER
KT
KT
THE
ARGUEMENT
CENTERED
AROUND
WHAT
WAS
OR
WASNT
THE
PROPER
BIBLICAL
KT
TERMS
FOR
THOSE
PLACES
I
RESPOND
THE
QUESTION
THAT
WAS
RAISED
WAS
NOT
IF
JESUS
WENT
TO
INFERNAL
PARADISE
BEFORE
ENTERING
INTO
HEAVEN
NO
ONE
HAS
MADE
A
POINT
FOR
OR
AGAINST
THAT
ISSUE
NOR
HAVE
THEY
COMPARED
THE
LDS
POSITION
AGAINST
ORTHODOX
BELIEF
THE
INFERNAL
PARADISE
IS
HELD
TO
BE
ABRAHAMS
BOSOM
LUKE
THE
PLACE
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS
DEAD
IN
SHEOL
EQUIVALENT
TO
HADES
THE
POINT
THAT
WAS
RAISED
BY
JOHN
WAS
THAT
SOMEONE
COULD
NOT
REPENT
ON
THEIR
DEATH
BED
TOM
ALBRECHT
POINTED
TO
A
BIBLICAL
EXAMPLE
THAT
WAS
CONTRADICTORY
TO
WHAT
JOHNS
POSITION
PUT
FORWARD
THE
THIEF
ON
THE
CROSS
WAS
PROMISED
BY
CHRIST
TO
BE
WITH
HIM
IN
PARADISE
THE
ABODE
OF
THE
RIGHTEOUS
DEAD
JOHNS
POSITION
POSSIBLY
NEEDS
TO
BE
REWORKED
KERMIT
NEEDS
TO
ADDRESS
THE
TOPIC

HAND
