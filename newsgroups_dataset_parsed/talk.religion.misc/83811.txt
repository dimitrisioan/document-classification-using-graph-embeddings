RE
FREEMASONRY
AND
THE
SOUTHERN
BAPTIST
CONVENTION
THERE
WERE
SOME
RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS
IN
THE
DISPUTE
ABOUT
MASONRY
AMONG
SOUTHERN
BAPTISTS
I
POSTED
A
SUMMARY
OVER
IN
BITLISTSERVCHRISTIA
AND
I
SUPPOSE
THAT
IT
MIGHT
BE
USEFUL
HERE
NOTE
THAT
I
DO
NOT
NECESSARILY
AGREE
OR
DISAGREE
WITH
ANY
OF
WHAT
FOLLOWS
I
PRESENT
IT
AS
INFORMATION
FOR
A
SHORT
SUMMARY
A
SOUTHERN
BAPTIST
NAMED
LARRY
HOLLY
WROTE
A
BOOK
CLAIMING
THAT
FREEMASONRY
IS
A
RELIGION
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
CHRISTIANITY
MR
HOLLYS
FATHER
REJECTS
CHRISTIANITY
AND
MR
HOLLY
BLAMES
THAT
ON
THE
MASONS
THE
SBCS
HOME
MISSIONS
BOARD
INCLUDES
AN
INTERFAITH
WITNESS
DEPARTMENT
WHICH
STUDIES
OTHER
RELIGIONS
AND
HOW
TO
TEACH
THEM
ABOUT
CHRIST
A
FEW
YEARS
AGO
THEY
WERE
ORDERED
TO
PRODUCE
A
REPORT
ON
MASONRY
THEY
CONCLUDED
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
A
RELIGION
AND
THEREFORE
WAS
OUTSIDE
THEIR
SPECIALITY
HOWEVER
MR
HOLLY
LED
A
MOVEMENT
OF
PEOPLE
WHO
OPPOSE
MASONRY
AND
LAST
YEAR
THE
CONVENTION
AGAIN
ORDERED
THE
HMB
TO
STUDY
MASONRY
I
GOT
THE
FEELING
THAT
THEY
WERE
SAYING
YOU
GOT
THE
WRONG
ANSWER
LAST
TIME
TRY
TO
DO
BETTER
AND
GET
THE
ANSWER
WE
WANT
ANYWAY
THERES
BEEN
A
BIT
OF
INFIGHTING
AND
SOME
INAPPROPRIATE
ACTIONS
BUT
THE
DUST
HAS
SETTLED
AND
THE
REPORT
IS
IN
NOBODY
IS
ENTIRELY
HAPPY
WITH
IT
BUT
EVERYBODY
SEEMS
WILLING
TO
LIVE
WITH
IT
BOTH
SIDES
ARE
SAYING
THINGS
SUCH
AS
THIS
WAS
THE
BEST
WE
WERE
GOING
TO
GET
IN
THE
CURRENT
ENVIRONMENT
THE
REPORT
COMMENDS
THE
MASONS
FOR
THE
CHARITY
WORK
THEY
DO
SUCH
AS
THE
HOSPITALS
AND
BURN
CENTERS
THEY
OPERATE
AS
WELL
AS
EFFORTS
TO
HELP
THE
ELDERLY
AND
PREVENT
DRUG
ABUSE
THE
REPORT
ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT
MANY
WELL
KNOWN
CHRISTIANS
ARE
AND
HAVE
BEEN
MASONS
AND
NOTES
THAT
MANY
TEACHINGS
OF
MASONRY
ARE
SUPPORTIVE
OF
CHRISTIAN
FAITH
AND
PRACTICE
EXAMPLES
OF
THE
LATTER
INCLUDE
BELIEF
IN
GOD
EMPHASES
ON
HONESTY
AND
INTEGRITY
AND
THAT
SOME
MASONIC
LODGES
INCORPORATE
EXPLICIT
CHRISTIAN
BELIEFS
ON
THE
OTHER
HAND
THEY
NOTE
THAT
SOME
ASPECTS
OF
MASONRY
ARE
INCOMPATIBLE
WITH
SOUTHERN
BAPTIST
PRINCIPLES
THESE
INCLUDED
THE
USE
OF
TITLES
WHICH
SOME
PEOPLE
CONSIDER
SACRILEGIOUS
THE
TAKING
OF
CERTAIN
OATHS
EVEN
THOUGH
THEY
ARE
NOT
MEANT
SERIOUSLY
THE
UNDENIABLY
PAGAN
ANDOR
OCCULTIC
WRITINGS
OF
SOME
MASONIC
LEADERS
THE
IMPLICATION
IN
SOME
MASONIC
WRITINGS
THAT
SALVATION
CAN
BE
ACHIEVED
BY
GOOD
WORKS
AND
THE
RACIAL
DISCRIMINATION
PRACTICED
BY
MANY
MASONIC
LODGES
I
NOTE
WITH
SOME
CHAGRIN
THAT
BAPTIST
CHURCHES
AS
A
WHOLE
ARENT
REALLY
IN
A
PLACE
TO
SPEAK
ON
THIS
LAST
POINT
THE
REPORT
CONCLUDES
THAT
MASONRY
IS
NOT
A
RELIGION
AND
SAYS
THAT
MEMBERSHIP
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ENDORSED
OR
CENSURED
BUT
LEFT
TO
THE
DISCRETION
OF
INDIVIDUALS
THIS
WAS
IN
PART
BECAUSE
THERE
IS
VARIATION
AMONG
DIFFERENT
MASONIC
LODGES
AND
WHILE
ONE
MAY
INCLUDE
ELEMENTS
STRONGLY
AGAINST
CHRISTIANITY
ANOTHER
MAY
NOT
MANY
SOUTHERN
BAPTISTS
HAVE
STRONG
CONVICTIONS
ABOUT
THE
PRIESTHOOD
OF
THE
BELIEVER
AND
THE
AUTONOMY
OF
THE
LOCAL
CHURCH
AND
THIS
HISTORY
PROBABLY
INFLUENCED
HOW
THE
REPORT
CAME
OUT
THE
INFORMATION
ABOVE
WAS
GLEANED
FROM
THE
RELIGIOUS
HERALD
A
PUBLICATION
OF
THE
BAPTIST
GENERAL
ASSOCIATION
OF
VIRGINIA
AND
BAPTISTS
TODAY
WHICH
DOES
NOT
HAVE
ANY
DIRECT
LINKS
TO
A
RELIGIOUS
ORGANISATION
AUTONOMY
IS
A
BIG
ISSUE
AMONG
SOME
BAPTISTS
BECAUSE
I
HAVE
NEITHER
THE
REPORT
ITSELF
NOR
WHATEVER
MASONIC
DOCUMENTS
ARE
RELEVANT
TO
THESE
ISSUES
NONE
OF
THE
ABOVE
