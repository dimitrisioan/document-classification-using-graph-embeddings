as
a
latterday
saint
i
found
johns
statement
not
at
all
ludicrous
please
allow
me
to
explain
myself
in
the
governor
of
missouri
governor
boggs
issued
his
socalled
mormon
extermination
order
the
only
crime
illegal
activity
the
latterday
saints
had
committed
was
their
religious
affiliation
their
antislave
stance
missouri
still
allowed
slave
practices
and
their
growing
numbersinfluence
in
missouri
i
guess
the
mormons
got
what
they
deserved
because
they
refused
to
bow
to
the
will
of
corrupt
and
evil
secular
authorities
this
disobedience
brought
upon
them
persecution
murder
and
finally
forced
expulsion
from
their
lands
and
settlements
it
is
significant
to
remember
that
these
secular
positions
were
held
by
average
people
and
that
at
the
time
almost
all
americans
were
pretty
homogeonously
christian
it
was
largely
the
mainstream
christians
disgust
at
such
practices
as
polygamy
which
resulted
in
their
irrational
hatred
true
but
that
is
exactly
the
problem
the
mormon
extermination
order
was
issued
not
just
by
a
christian
it
was
allowed
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
was
instituted
precisely
to
prevent
incidents
like
this
order
from
occurring
in
the
first
place
as
i
indicated
in
an
earlier
posting
your
irrational
hatred
is
clearly
evidenced
by
individuals
like
robert
weiss
who
could
have
been
gov
boggs
lieutenant
he
would
have
fitted
right
in
drewling
et
al
and
seems
a
modernday
occurrence
based
on
results
slander
persecution
misrepresentation
lies
denying
mormons
representation
in
their
own
user
group
etc
etc
in
intent
and
purpose
what
really
has
changed
the
situation
is
not
entirely
different
today
many
irrational
feelings
and
beliefs
are
justified
through
religion
i
dont
think
most
of
them
are
started
because
of
religion
but
religion
certainly
helps
justify
and
perpetuate
prejudices
and
practices
by
providing
a
neat
justification
which
discourages
critical
thought
true
as
evidenced
by
numerous
examples
as
i
am
sure
youre
aware
in
any
regard
mormon
history
alone
indicates
that
secular
authorities
and
i
dont
even
discuss
how
uthans
were
suckered
into
allowing
part
of
their
lands
in
becoming
nervegas
and
atomic
bomb
testing
grounds
is
far
from
being
trusted
or
righteous
have
things
really
changed
for
the
better
i
may
be
a
born
cynic
but
i
have
no
reason
whatsoever
that
such
has
been
the
case
in
the
early
i
believe
the
late
president
kimball
lds
church
leader
strongly
protested
federal
attempts
to
locate
the
mxpeace
keeper
missile
maze
from
being
built
in
utah
yet
another
inspired
decision
from
secular
authorities
fortunately
his
opposition
was
influential
enough
for
the
feds
to
back
off
do
you
mean
that
the
secular
authorities
are
some
continuous
group
of
people
with
the
common
and
uninterrupted
goal
of
harrassingeradicating
the
mormons
do
you
honestly
believe
that
the
main
reason
for
using
utah
for
nuclear
testing
etc
was
to
get
them
thar
mormons
and
what
about
the
majority
of
uthans
who
arent
mormons
you
seem
to
be
searching
for
enemy
correction
the
majority
of
utahns
are
mormon
i
believe
up
to
a
in
many
cities
and
settlements
throughout
the
western
states
conspiracies
it
is
paranoid
to
believe
that
everything
that
affects
you
badly
must
have
been
done
primarily
for
that
purpose
what
i
mean
is
that
secular
authorities
are
to
be
watched
as
we
believe
that
satan
has
been
given
some
power
and
dominion
over
the
earth
to
divert
truth
judgment
and
justice
in
addition
we
believe
that
the
adversary
has
power
to
influence
the
unjust
and
idolatrous
greed
for
money
would
be
a
good
example
in
order
to
bring
about
persecution
war
oppression
and
evil
combinations
as
an
intelligent
being
dont
you
suppose
that
the
destroyer
would
yield
his
influence
foremost
on
those
with
political
power
as
far
as
utah
is
concerned
what
i
pointed
out
were
some
horrible
examples
of
environmental
nightmares
imposed
upon
by
secular
authorities
which
have
brought
death
disease
ie
the
downwinders
and
environmental
contami
nation
i
am
hardly
paranoid
i
am
just
not
expecting
too
much
from
a
secular
government
that
may
not
share
our
values
and
faith
and
which
indeed
as
gov
boggs
et
al
may
be
out
to
harm
and
destroy
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
prophecies
in
my
church
indicate
that
in
future
years
global
persecution
against
mormons
will
so
increase
in
intensity
and
scope
that
paraphrasing
all
those
who
wish
to
escape
persecution
and
murder
must
flee
to
zion
zion
the
pure
in
heart
will
be
reestablished
in
those
days
and
it
aint
our
current
secular
authorities
who
will
rule
over
it
david
koresh
did
not
pose
a
great
threat
to
the
federal
authorities
or
the
security
of
this
nation
and
with
john
i
too
wonder
who
or
whats
next
i
personally
feel
that
we
should
try
to
stop
anyone
who
is
a
threat
to
the
life
of
even
one
person
sure
he
did
not
pose
a
threat
to
the
security
of
this
nation
but
he
did
pose
a
threat
to
the
lives
of
his
followers
that
much
is
definite
hmmm
definite
by
whom
until
such
has
been
established
beyond
reason
able
doubt
this
alleged
threat
may
have
been
less
than
the
threat
imposed
upon
him
and
his
followers
by
the
batf
and
fbi
who
killed
who
what
constitutional
right
did
the
atf
officers
have
to
invade
upon
private
land
and
to
force
themselves
into
the
compound
what
really
caused
the
murder
of
the
little
children
could
it
be
that
the
atffbi
presence
has
any
bearing
upon
the
events
how
would
you
interpret
the
mt
masada
events
blame
the
jews
what
the
heck
did
the
romans
do
there
anyway
what
business
did
the
atffbi
has
in
waco
texas
the
branch
davidians
never
posed
any
threat
to
society
this
is
like
asking
who
really
caused
the
deaths
of
the
israeli
olympic
team
in
in
that
case
the
police
botched
the
job
as
well
but
to
lay
a
heavier
burden
on
them
than
the
terrorists
would
be
a
terrible
mistake
i
think
the
same
sort
of
reasoning
applies
in
this
case
certainly
if
david
koresh
chose
any
peaceful
option
the
atf
and
fbi
would
have
complied
the
responsibility
is
more
his
than
the
authorities
come
now
at
issue
is
in
how
much
the
authorities
escalated
an
otherwise
peaceful
standoff
lets
get
it
over
with
and
force
david
koresh
to
come
out
by
gassing
them
were
they
naive
or
what
they
played
right
into
the
hands
of
an
apocalypticthinking
individual
he
had
prepared
his
people
for
this
eventuality
for
years
and
not
one
firetruck
or
plan
was
in
place
to
deal
with
this
scenario
i
feel
that
the
authorities
had
some
responsibility
to
protect
their
own
citizens
even
if
they
were
religious
zealots
and
guilty
of
not
paying
a
gun
license
has
the
batf
become
an
extension
of
the
local
taxcollectors
david
koresh
no
doubt
will
be
described
as
the
evil
guy
by
the
executioners
while
the
actions
of
all
those
valiant
and
brave
officers
characterizing
the
atffbi
as
executioners
is
inaccurate
and
unfair
in
order
to
be
an
executioner
the
least
one
must
have
done
is
have
the
intent
to
kill
que
intrusion
into
private
property
with
semis
loaded
with
life
ammunition
isnt
that
implicit
intent
or
at
least
prepared
to
kill
i
ask
you
would
the
batf
warrant
stand
up
in
a
civil
court
of
justice
i
do
not
mind
if
criminals
such
as
dangerous
drug
lords
are
brought
to
justice
but
escalating
events
to
the
point
of
allowing
to
if
not
compli
city
with
the
destruction
of
a
people
