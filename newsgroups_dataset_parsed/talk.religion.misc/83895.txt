hi
all
im
going
to
try
to
do
something
here
that
perhaps
many
would
not
have
thought
even
possible
i
want
to
begin
the
process
of
initiating
a
literary
critical
study
of
the
pornography
posted
on
altsexstories
to
identify
the
major
themes
and
motifs
present
in
the
stories
posted
there
opening
up
then
the
possibility
of
an
objective
moral
evaluation
of
the
material
present
there
first
off
let
me
congratulate
you
for
not
posting
a
flame
about
you
sick
perverts
you
are
immoral
you
are
all
going
to
hell
which
seems
to
be
the
usual
religious
post
found
on
the
altsex
hierarchy
hopefully
you
wont
get
flamed
either
you
will
however
be
argued
with
i
personally
think
that
your
project
is
built
on
unsteady
ground
first
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
way
to
find
an
objective
morality
morality
and
value
are
inherently
subjective
they
represent
the
beliefs
of
a
person
or
a
group
of
people
they
can
be
widely
held
perhaps
even
overwhelmingly
held
but
they
are
never
and
can
never
be
objective
assumptions
a
christian
bedrock
assumption
that
all
that
is
true
comes
truly
from
god
regarding
altsexstories
while
perhaps
even
from
an
objective
standpoint
the
majority
of
its
material
is
indeed
repugnant
you
come
to
this
conclusion
quite
quickly
when
you
start
thinking
about
analyzing
its
material
like
this
some
of
it
reflects
some
fairly
profound
needs
in
people
as
well
as
some
truths
and
deserve
to
be
pointed
out
second
i
do
not
accept
the
assumptions
that
you
make
here
if
as
you
say
you
are
trying
to
be
objective
then
why
accept
a
morality
to
begin
with
by
using
the
christian
bible
youre
defeating
your
own
purpose
by
doing
so
in
the
long
run
the
advantage
of
making
such
a
literarymoral
analysis
is
that
it
will
save
bandwidth
between
christians
and
non
mutually
flaming
each
other
about
the
moral
acceptability
of
the
stuff
on
these
pornographic
groups
third
call
me
a
pessimist
but
you
wont
stop
the
flamage
there
will
always
be
people
who
pop
upin
altsex
to
tell
us
how
sick
and
twisted
and
evil
we
all
are
just
out
of
curiosity
do
altsex
readers
show
up
unprovoked
in
the
religion
groups
to
tell
you
all
that
you
are
narrowminded
censoring
overbearing
totalitarianists
basically
there
should
not
be
a
dissonance
between
a
christian
morality
and
a
nonchristian
one
either
there
is
value
in
a
particular
work
or
there
is
not
whether
one
is
a
christian
or
not
hm
let
me
provide
an
example
four
people
get
together
over
dinner
to
discuss
morality
you
me
a
rather
conservative
moslem
and
a
sociopath
i
start
off
by
saying
that
i
think
its
immoral
to
force
people
to
have
sex
with
you
you
agree
but
also
say
that
it
is
immoral
to
have
sex
with
someone
of
your
own
gender
just
a
note
i
really
dont
know
your
views
on
homosexuality
i
am
just
using
this
as
a
common
view
of
morality
for
the
purposes
of
this
example
the
moslem
says
that
it
is
immoral
for
women
to
have
their
faces
uncovered
the
sociopath
who
has
become
bored
kills
all
three
of
us
and
eats
us
but
feels
no
guilt
because
he
has
done
nothing
wrong
morally
in
his
own
mind
in
support
for
the
first
assumption
the
christian
scriptures
say
this
evidence
deleted
im
not
going
to
accept
your
evidence
for
this
you
ask
us
to
accept
the
word
of
god
that
everything
good
comes
from
god
this
is
only
a
valid
argument
for
a
person
who
shares
your
beliefs
still
i
must
say
that
cataloging
the
major
themes
and
motifs
in
erotica
could
be
interesting
for
other
reasons
than
yours
so
good
luck
with
this
next
part
now
then
what
are
some
of
the
major
themesmotifs
in
the
pornographic
literature
on
places
like
altsexstories
these
are
some
that
ive
been
able
to
identify
please
addcomment
on
them
motif
the
malecinderella
in
so
many
of
the
stories
there
is
expressed
a
feeling
of
alienation
and
worthlessness
on
the
part
of
the
writer
or
otherwise
protagonist
of
the
story
with
regard
to
the
object
the
other
person
of
hisher
desire
often
a
story
involves
a
protagonist
who
on
the
surface
is
quite
average
but
underneath
usually
has
an
enormous
dick
who
desires
to
in
some
way
to
gain
access
in
a
definitely
sexual
way
to
the
other
person
who
heshe
confesses
is
far
more
desireable
than
heshe
is
and
who
indeed
seems
to
walk
between
the
raindrops
hmmmdo
i
detect
just
a
wee
bit
of
condescence
here
motif
a
celebration
of
indeed
preoccupation
with
beauty
not
very
objective
the
vast
majority
of
pornographic
literature
deals
with
beauty
be
it
innocence
somehow
about
to
be
lost
grace
or
simply
physical
beauty
and
generally
most
people
christian
or
non
will
say
that
beauty
is
good
one
could
construe
this
to
mean
that
beautiful
people
are
better
or
more
good
than
nonbeautiful
people
i
would
hope
that
people
relize
that
this
is
not
necessarily
true
motif
ones
dick
is
ones
instrument
of
redemption
might
i
suggest
the
word
penis
it
seems
more
in
line
with
the
tone
of
your
post
blessed
are
those
who
are
wellhung
for
they
shall
get
laid
from
what
would
thus
be
a
revised
matthew
bravo
i
respect
you
and
your
sense
of
humor
sir
motif
sex
as
an
expression
of
sincere
giving
there
is
often
enough
a
clear
desire
on
the
part
of
the
protagonist
to
give
definitely
sexual
pleasure
to
the
object
person
of
hisher
desires
yes
and
this
theme
is
usually
what
the
better
stories
are
about
however
they
are
not
always
selfish
i
could
point
to
examples
in
the
work
of
elf
sternberg
for
example
motif
altsexstories
describes
a
sex
which
is
completely
removed
from
the
realm
of
transmitting
life
so
removed
is
sex
from
its
procreative
dimension
on
altsexstories
that
one
begins
to
wonder
why
sex
even
involves
ejaculation
as
in
the
context
described
in
pornography
it
serves
then
no
real
purpose
it
serves
the
same
purpose
as
it
does
in
pornographic
movies
it
affirms
the
virility
of
the
male
involved
as
well
as
assuring
the
reader
that
he
the
character
has
orgasmed
the
whole
picture
tm
is
probably
very
well
described
by
the
catholic
teaching
on
this
of
the
husband
and
wife
in
an
act
of
total
mutual
selfgiving
in
the
sexual
union
cooperating
with
god
in
opening
themselves
up
for
the
transmission
of
new
life
cf
humane
vitae
your
whole
picture
tm
unfortunately
only
applies
to
people
who
accept
your
church
in
addition
if
sex
is
for
procreation
then
why
did
god
make
it
pleasurable
so
that
people
would
want
to
do
it
rather
than
building
it
in
as
instinct
why
did
god
make
it
fallible
not
every
sexual
encounter
results
in
pregnancy
even
among
catholics
does
this
mean
that
they
have
sinned
in
any
case
altsexstories
and
the
catholic
teaching
will
probably
not
see
eye
to
eye
on
this
for
a
long
time
granted
motif
sex
used
as
an
instrument
violence
power
and
humiliation
why
pornography
seems
to
tend
in
that
direction
i
really
do
not
know
probably
volumes
could
be
written
on
the
relationships
between
sex
and
powerhumiliation
but
this
probably
gives
good
reason
why
traditionally
judeochristianity
has
been
so
negative
with
regard
to
sexuality
it
seems
to
tend
to
a
great
moral
morass
pornography
would
not
tend
in
those
directions
if
there
were
not
a
demand
for
it
many
people
have
violent
fantasies
that
they
would
never
act
out
in
real
life
but
will
think
about
and
read
about
and
mull
over
later
