one
of
the
cult
members
said
that
the
fire
was
started
when
one
of
the
tanks
spraying
the
tear
gas
into
the
facilities
knocked
over
a
lantern
in
two
places
at
once
bit
of
a
coincidence
that
never
lived
out
in
the
country
i
see
years
ago
i
had
a
place
where
i
had
to
carry
in
propane
every
month
hook
the
bottle
up
to
copper
line
to
supply
both
the
stove
and
a
type
of
water
heater
called
a
flashheater
a
flash
heater
has
a
pilot
lamp
heres
the
point
if
the
davidians
had
their
propane
tanks
hooked
up
to
copper
or
some
such
lines
run
through
the
ceiling
spaces
when
the
fbi
started
wrecking
the
place
they
could
easily
have
ruptured
the
lines
which
then
would
start
spreading
out
through
the
overhead
and
since
it
was
a
country
home
it
wasnt
necessarily
built
with
nonflamable
insulation
its
probably
more
plausible
than
anything
else
that
the
fire
started
mainly
as
a
result
of
accident
or
willful
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
fbi
which
should
have
known
better
ie
manslaughter
its
certain
that
if
the
tanks
hadnt
been
used
that
day
the
fire
wouldnt
have
started
whatever
the
faults
the
fbi
had
the
fact
is
that
responsibility
for
those
deaths
lies
with
koresh
paul
what
fact
